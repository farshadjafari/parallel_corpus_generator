1
00:00:21,263 --> 00:00:23,527
In the "New York Herald ..."

2
00:00:23,568 --> 00:00:26,945
November 26, year 1911 ...

3
00:00:26,986 --> 00:00:30,198
there is an account of the
hanging of three men.

4
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:37,579
They died for the murder
of Sir Edmund William Godfrey ...

5
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,207
husband, father, pharmacist ...

6
00:00:39,249 --> 00:00:41,375
and all-around gentleman resident ...

7
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:45,170
of Greenberry Hill, London.

8
00:00:45,213 --> 00:00:47,381
He was murdered by three vagrants ...

9
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:49,634
whose motive was simple robbery.

10
00:00:49,676 --> 00:00:51,344
They were identified as ...

11
00:00:51,386 --> 00:00:53,887
Joseph Green ...

12
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:56,015
Stanley Berry ...

13
00:00:56,057 --> 00:00:57,933
and Daniel Hill.

14
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:04,691
Green, Berry, Hill.

15
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:10,947
And I would like to think this
was only a matter of chance.

16
00:01:13,283 --> 00:01:15,573
As reported in the "Reno Gazette ..."

17
00:01:15,614 --> 00:01:18,450
June of 1983 ...

18
00:01:18,492 --> 00:01:20,453
there is the story of a fire ...

19
00:01:20,495 --> 00:01:22,706
the water that it took
to contain the fire ...

20
00:01:24,165 --> 00:01:27,918
and a scuba diver
named Delmer Darion.

21
00:01:30,671 --> 00:01:35,051
Employee of the Nugget Hotel
and Casino, Reno, Nevada ...

22
00:01:35,093 --> 00:01:37,094
engaged as a blackjack dealer.

23
00:01:37,137 --> 00:01:39,264
Well-liked and well-regarded ...

24
00:01:39,305 --> 00:01:42,391
as a physical, recreational,
and sporting sort ...

25
00:01:42,433 --> 00:01:44,936
Delmer's true passion
was for the lake.

26
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:58,866
As reported by the coroner,
Delmer died of a heart attack ...

27
00:01:58,908 --> 00:02:01,368
somewhere between
the lake and the tree ...

28
00:02:01,368 --> 00:02:02,912
but most curious side note ...

29
00:02:02,953 --> 00:02:06,120
is the suicide the next day
of Craig Hansen ...

30
00:02:06,162 --> 00:02:09,332
volunteer fire fighter,
estranged father of four ...

31
00:02:09,373 --> 00:02:11,710
and a poor tendency to drink.

32
00:02:11,752 --> 00:02:14,962
Mr. Hansen was the pilot of
the plane that accidentally ...

33
00:02:15,004 --> 00:02:17,716
lifted Delmer Darion
out of the water.

34
00:02:17,758 --> 00:02:20,635
Added to this,
Mr. Hansen's tortured life ...

35
00:02:20,676 --> 00:02:24,264
met before with Delmer Darion
just two nights previous.

36
00:02:24,306 --> 00:02:25,723
All I need is a two.

37
00:02:25,765 --> 00:02:28,852
All you need is a deuce.
All right.

38
00:02:28,894 --> 00:02:30,395
That is an eight.

39
00:02:30,437 --> 00:02:33,064
Glad you like my work.
Moment of truth.

40
00:02:34,233 --> 00:02:35,692
The weight of the guilt ...

41
00:02:35,734 --> 00:02:38,486
and the measure
of coincidence so large ...

42
00:02:38,528 --> 00:02:40,531
Craig Hansen took his life.

43
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:44,408
And I am trying to think ...

44
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:48,121
this was all only
a matter of chance.

45
00:02:48,163 --> 00:02:51,415
The tale told
at a 1961 awards dinner ...

46
00:02:51,457 --> 00:02:54,418
for the American Association
of Forensic Science ...

47
00:02:54,461 --> 00:02:57,836
by Dr. John Harper,
president of the association ...

48
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:01,006
began with a simple suicide attempt.

49
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:04,342
Seventeen-year-old Sydney Barringer ...

50
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:09,681
in the city of Los Angeles
on March 23, 1958.

51
00:03:25,656 --> 00:03:28,033
The coroner ruled that
the unsuccessful suicide ...

52
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:31,203
had suddenly become
a successful homicide.

53
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:34,747
To explain − the suicide
was confirmed by a note ...

54
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:37,960
in the right hip pocket
of Sydney Barringer.

55
00:03:38,002 --> 00:03:42,338
At the same time young Sydney
stood on the ledge ...

56
00:03:42,381 --> 00:03:45,046
an argument swelled
three stories below.

57
00:03:45,046 --> 00:03:48,259
The neighbors heard,
as they usually did ...

58
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,051
the arguing of the tenants ...

59
00:03:50,093 --> 00:03:51,512
and it was not uncommon
for them ...

60
00:03:51,554 --> 00:03:53,764
to threaten each other
with a shotgun ...

61
00:03:53,805 --> 00:03:56,057
or one of the many hand guns
kept in the house.

62
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:57,977
I'm going to put you down!

63
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:00,229
And when the shotgun
accidentally went off ...

64
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,480
You asshole!

65
00:04:03,106 --> 00:04:05,067
Sydney just happened to pass.

66
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:06,235
What?

67
00:04:06,276 --> 00:04:09,237
Shut the fuck up!

68
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,866
Added to this,
the tenants turned out to be ...

69
00:04:12,908 --> 00:04:14,618
Fay and Arthur Barringer ...

70
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:17,747
Sydney's mother and father.

71
00:04:17,788 --> 00:04:19,874
When confronted
with the charge ...

72
00:04:19,915 --> 00:04:23,502
which took some figuring out
for the officers on the scene ...

73
00:04:23,543 --> 00:04:27,714
Fay Barringer swore she did not
know the gun was loaded.

74
00:04:27,757 --> 00:04:31,259
She always threatens me with it,
but I don't keep it loaded.

75
00:04:31,302 --> 00:04:33,971
And you didn't load the gun?

76
00:04:34,012 --> 00:04:35,470
Why would I load the gun?

77
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,680
A young boy
who lived in the building ...

78
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:40,641
sometimes a visitor and friend
to Sydney Barringer ...

79
00:04:40,682 --> 00:04:43,019
said that he had seen,
six days prior ...

80
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,687
the loading of the shotgun.

81
00:04:44,728 --> 00:04:46,314
Ricky, come here a minute.

82
00:04:46,355 --> 00:04:48,608
It seems that all
the arguing and fighting ...

83
00:04:48,649 --> 00:04:51,819
and violence was far too much
for Sydney Barringer ...

84
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,197
and knowing his mother and
father's tendency to fight ...

85
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,867
he decided to do something.

86
00:04:57,908 --> 00:05:00,745
He said he wanted them
to kill each other ...

87
00:05:00,786 --> 00:05:03,622
and all they wanted to do
was to kill each other ...

88
00:05:03,665 --> 00:05:06,875
and he would help them do that
if that's what they wanted.

89
00:05:06,918 --> 00:05:10,922
Sydney Barringer jumps
from the ninth floor roof top.

90
00:05:10,963 --> 00:05:13,550
His parents argue
three stories below.

91
00:05:13,591 --> 00:05:16,677
Her accidental shotgun blast
hits Sydney in the stomach ...

92
00:05:16,718 --> 00:05:19,680
as he passes the arguing
sixth floor window.

93
00:05:19,721 --> 00:05:22,850
He is killed instantly,
but continues to fall ...

94
00:05:22,891 --> 00:05:25,307
only to find, five stories below ...

95
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,685
a safety net
installed three days prior ...

96
00:05:27,726 --> 00:05:30,271
for a set of window washers
that would've broken his fall ...

97
00:05:30,312 --> 00:05:33,733
and saved his life − if not
for the hole in his stomach.

98
00:05:33,774 --> 00:05:37,403
So Fay Barringer was charged
with the murder of her son ...

99
00:05:37,444 --> 00:05:42,533
and Sydney Barringer noted as
an accomplice in his own death.

100
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:44,286
And it is in the humble opinion
of this narrator ...

101
00:05:44,326 --> 00:05:47,497
that this is not just
"something that happened."

102
00:05:47,538 --> 00:05:51,375
This cannot be
"one of those things."

103
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:54,254
This, please, cannot be that.

104
00:05:54,295 --> 00:05:57,090
And for what
I would like to say, I can't.

105
00:05:57,132 --> 00:05:59,759
This was not just
a matter of chance.

106
00:06:01,845 --> 00:06:04,139
These strange things
happen all the time.

107
00:06:33,831 --> 00:06:36,627
In this big game
that we play, life ...

108
00:06:36,668 --> 00:06:38,754
it's not what you hope for
or deserve ...

109
00:06:38,795 --> 00:06:41,130
it's what you take.

110
00:06:41,173 --> 00:06:44,884
I'm Frank T. J. Mackey,
a master of the muffin ...

111
00:06:44,927 --> 00:06:46,552
and author of the
"Seduce and Destroy" system ...

112
00:06:46,595 --> 00:06:49,180
now available to you
on audio and video cassette.

113
00:06:49,223 --> 00:06:52,183
"Seduce and Destroy"
will teach you the techniques ...

114
00:06:52,225 --> 00:06:57,523
to have any hard-body blonde
just dripping to wet your dock.

115
00:06:57,564 --> 00:07:00,192
Bottom line? Language.

116
00:07:00,233 --> 00:07:03,694
The magical key to unlocking
the female analytical mind set.

117
00:07:03,737 --> 00:07:05,985
Tap directly
into her hopes, her wants ...

118
00:07:06,028 --> 00:07:10,031
her fears, her desires,
and her sweet little panties.

119
00:07:10,074 --> 00:07:12,617
Learn how to make
that lady "friend" ...

120
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,620
your sex-starved servant.

121
00:07:14,661 --> 00:07:18,706
"Seduce and Destroy" produces
a money-back guaranteed ...

122
00:07:18,749 --> 00:07:20,709
trance-like state that will get you ...

123
00:07:20,793 --> 00:07:26,673
the naughty sauce you want fast.

124
00:07:26,714 --> 00:07:28,007
How many more times ...

125
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,927
do you need to hear
the all-too-famous line ...

126
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,512
So?

127
00:07:32,555 --> 00:07:36,141
"I just don't feel
that way about you"?

128
00:07:36,182 --> 00:07:38,894
For over thirty years,
America has hung out ...

129
00:07:38,935 --> 00:07:41,605
and answered questions
with Jimmy Gator ...

130
00:07:41,646 --> 00:07:44,817
an American legend
and a true television icon.

131
00:07:44,858 --> 00:07:48,446
Jimmy celebrates his 12,000th
hour of broadcast this week.

132
00:07:48,487 --> 00:07:50,322
Have I been around that long?

133
00:07:50,322 --> 00:07:53,158
He's a family man who's been
married for over forty years ...

134
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,284
with two children
and one grand child on the way.

135
00:07:57,326 --> 00:08:00,036
We've tuned in each day to see
the human interaction ...

136
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,999
between Jimmy
and some very special kids ...

137
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,334
and we hope there's thirty more
years of watching that happen.

138
00:08:06,377 --> 00:08:07,502
I'm Jimmy Gator.

139
00:08:07,545 --> 00:08:08,920
Donald W. Winnicott.

140
00:08:08,963 --> 00:08:10,923
1911. North America.
South America.

141
00:08:10,964 --> 00:08:13,675
The answer is four.
Twenty-two. Gravity.

142
00:08:13,718 --> 00:08:15,552
The answer is
"The Life of Samuel Johnson."

143
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,185
Let's go. You should've
done that ten minutes ago.

144
00:08:23,226 --> 00:08:25,896
- We need more dog food.
- Talk in the car.

145
00:08:25,937 --> 00:08:28,733
Look, I got
a serious audition today.

146
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:30,401
Come on. That one, too?

147
00:08:30,442 --> 00:08:32,736
I need this one.

148
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:35,740
I don't understand why you need
4 bags of books to go to school.

149
00:08:37,658 --> 00:08:39,994
There's no reason
for this many back packs.

150
00:08:41,162 --> 00:08:43,121
- Be ready at 2:00.
- It should be 1:30.

151
00:08:43,163 --> 00:08:46,456
I told you I got an audition.
I won't be here till 2:00.

152
00:08:46,498 --> 00:08:48,540
Get your stuff.
I got to go. Love you.

153
00:08:48,582 --> 00:08:49,709
Love you, too.

154
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,796
Donnie, do you have an answer?

155
00:08:52,836 --> 00:08:55,465
I do, Jimmy. Prometheus.

156
00:08:55,506 --> 00:08:56,673
It is!

157
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:00,720
Donnie, how does it feel?

158
00:09:04,807 --> 00:09:05,975
Pretty exciting.

159
00:09:06,017 --> 00:09:08,602
Bet you don't get many people
my age getting braces.

160
00:09:08,644 --> 00:09:11,147
You were so cute
on that game show.

161
00:09:11,147 --> 00:09:13,982
Bet you can't answer
any questions now, though.

162
00:09:14,024 --> 00:09:16,360
- We're all set to go, Donnie.
- Good.

163
00:09:16,402 --> 00:09:18,321
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

164
00:09:18,363 --> 00:09:20,322
You're running around
like crazy, huh?

165
00:09:20,322 --> 00:09:21,825
Gonna be late for work.

166
00:09:35,126 --> 00:09:36,544
The Quiz Kid Donnie Smith!

167
00:09:47,346 --> 00:09:48,764
How's today, then?

168
00:09:48,807 --> 00:09:52,601
Fucking bullshit
is what this is.

169
00:09:52,644 --> 00:09:54,770
Fucking regrets.

170
00:09:54,812 --> 00:09:57,857
And we do these things,
move through this life.

171
00:09:59,567 --> 00:10:01,903
I'm going
to need your help, Phil.

172
00:10:01,945 --> 00:10:03,613
You got to help me
on something today.

173
00:10:03,654 --> 00:10:05,698
I'll take care.
Anything, Earl.

174
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,951
You're his doctor,
and that's why.

175
00:10:07,993 --> 00:10:10,912
Tell me something.

176
00:10:10,953 --> 00:10:13,038
And he needs more pills.
Fuck it.

177
00:10:13,081 --> 00:10:15,542
He needs more pills,
and I need some answers ...

178
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,293
so I'm coming to see you.

179
00:10:20,922 --> 00:10:22,215
Good morning, Linda.

180
00:10:27,301 --> 00:10:29,344
I love you, my darling.

181
00:10:29,385 --> 00:10:31,889
I'll be back in a while.
I have to do some things.

182
00:10:31,929 --> 00:10:34,640
I have to see something,
and I'll be back.

183
00:10:36,058 --> 00:10:37,394
Fuck!

184
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:46,068
Press one to hear this person's
description of themselves ...

185
00:10:46,153 --> 00:10:49,572
and two to leave
a personal message of your own.

186
00:10:49,655 --> 00:10:54,036
Well, hello. This is Jim.
I work in law enforcement.

187
00:10:54,076 --> 00:10:55,620
I'm an officer for the LAPD ...

188
00:10:55,662 --> 00:10:57,998
and work out of
the North Hollywood district.

189
00:10:57,998 --> 00:11:00,793
I love my job,
and I love to go to the movies.

190
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:03,044
I try to stay physically fit.
My job demands it.

191
00:11:03,086 --> 00:11:04,879
So I'm in pretty good shape.
I'm getting up there, though.

192
00:11:04,922 --> 00:11:09,342
I'm 32, 6 feet 2,
and weigh about 180 ...

193
00:11:09,342 --> 00:11:11,470
if that's important to you.

194
00:11:11,511 --> 00:11:13,679
I'm really interested
in meeting someone special ...

195
00:11:13,721 --> 00:11:15,096
who likes quiet things.

196
00:11:15,136 --> 00:11:16,596
My life is very stressful ...

197
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:19,265
and I hope for a relationship
that is very calm ...

198
00:11:19,307 --> 00:11:21,894
and undemanding and loving.

199
00:11:21,936 --> 00:11:26,524
If you are this person, leave me
a message at box number 8-2.

200
00:11:26,565 --> 00:11:27,691
Thank you.

201
00:11:34,072 --> 00:11:36,866
So much violence ...

202
00:11:36,908 --> 00:11:38,827
but that's the way of the world.

203
00:11:38,869 --> 00:11:40,453
Good luck, as always.

204
00:11:40,495 --> 00:11:42,706
Serve and protect and
all that other blah-blah-blah ...

205
00:11:42,748 --> 00:11:44,457
on the side of the car.

206
00:11:47,336 --> 00:11:49,797
Let me tell you something.

207
00:11:49,838 --> 00:11:53,216
This is not an easy job.

208
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:57,138
I get a call on the radio
from dispatch.

209
00:11:57,178 --> 00:12:00,765
It's bad news ...

210
00:12:00,807 --> 00:12:02,434
and it stinks.

211
00:12:04,937 --> 00:12:08,895
But this is my job,
and I love it.

212
00:12:10,565 --> 00:12:12,899
Because I want to do well.

213
00:12:12,942 --> 00:12:16,278
In this life and in this world,
I want to do well ...

214
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,240
and I want to help people.

215
00:12:19,282 --> 00:12:21,951
And I might get
twenty bad calls a day ...

216
00:12:21,993 --> 00:12:24,620
but one time
I can help someone ...

217
00:12:24,662 --> 00:12:27,164
I make a save ...

218
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:31,168
I correct a wrong
or right a situation ...

219
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,961
then I'm a happy cop.

220
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:38,967
And we move through this life,
we should try and do good.

221
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,017
Do good.

222
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:52,148
And if we can do that ...

223
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,649
and not hurt anyone else ...

224
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:58,400
well, then ...

225
00:13:08,577 --> 00:13:10,120
- Hello?
- Who is it?

226
00:13:10,163 --> 00:13:12,373
Every time I turn around,
there's something else.

227
00:13:12,414 --> 00:13:14,417
- Slow down.
- You can't just come in here!

228
00:13:14,417 --> 00:13:15,751
The door was open, ma'am.
I got a call.

229
00:13:15,793 --> 00:13:17,336
- You're not allowed to come in.
- Calm down.

230
00:13:17,378 --> 00:13:18,587
I am calm.

231
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:21,508
I got a call to this apartment,
report of a disturbance.

232
00:13:21,548 --> 00:13:22,926
There's no disturbance.

233
00:13:22,926 --> 00:13:26,929
I got a call of a disturbance.
I want to see what's going on.

234
00:13:26,971 --> 00:13:28,597
There's no disturbance.

235
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,350
Then, you got nothing
to worry about.

236
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:34,354
You don't tell me.
I know my rights. You can't ...

237
00:13:34,394 --> 00:13:36,230
Ma'am, you want to test me?

238
00:13:36,272 --> 00:13:39,399
Want to tell me
about the law book?

239
00:13:39,442 --> 00:13:42,570
You push me far enough,
I will take you to jail.

240
00:13:42,611 --> 00:13:46,571
- Now calm yourself down.
- I am calm!

241
00:13:46,613 --> 00:13:49,783
No. You are not calm.
You're screaming at me.

242
00:13:49,825 --> 00:13:52,284
Do you understand?

243
00:13:52,326 --> 00:13:55,455
I got a call of a disturbance,
and I'm checking it out.

244
00:13:55,496 --> 00:13:59,375
That is what I'm going to do.
Are you alone in here?

245
00:13:59,418 --> 00:14:01,001
I ain't got to answer you.

246
00:14:01,043 --> 00:14:04,505
No, you don't, but I'm going
to ask you one more time.

247
00:14:04,505 --> 00:14:05,798
Are you alone in here?

248
00:14:05,841 --> 00:14:07,759
What does it look like?

249
00:14:07,801 --> 00:14:10,136
- There's no one else in here?
- You in here.

250
00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:14,850
That's true,
but is there anyone else ...

251
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,976
besides me and you
in this house?

252
00:14:17,018 --> 00:14:18,727
No. I said that already.

253
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:21,148
- Are you lying to me?
- I live by myself.

254
00:14:21,188 --> 00:14:24,900
That might be true, but
the question I'm asking you ...

255
00:14:24,942 --> 00:14:27,195
Is there anyone else
in this house right now?

256
00:14:30,197 --> 00:14:32,868
- What is your name?
- Marcie.

257
00:14:32,908 --> 00:14:35,868
Marcie, I'm going to need you
to take a seat here.

258
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:37,619
I prefer to stand up.

259
00:14:37,661 --> 00:14:39,663
I'm not asking.

260
00:14:41,289 --> 00:14:42,832
I didn't even do nothing!

261
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,375
Move, ma'am.

262
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:54,595
Like I was saying, I'm here
to check on a disturbance.

263
00:14:54,635 --> 00:14:57,556
Some of your neighbors heard
screaming and a loud crash.

264
00:14:57,597 --> 00:15:00,225
I don't even know no loud crash.

265
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:02,936
- What was that?
- I didn't hear nothing.

266
00:15:02,977 --> 00:15:04,437
Sit on the couch.

267
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,938
I ain't got to do
a goddamn thing.

268
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:09,400
- What's this bullshit?
- Do not do this.

269
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:13,238
- Do not slap me, ma'am.
- This is bullshit!

270
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,241
For what? Huh?
Tell me for what!

271
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,827
I asked you
to sit on the couch, ma'am.

272
00:15:21,455 --> 00:15:23,916
This is bullshit.
Fucking bullshit.

273
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:26,373
15-L-27,
I'm going to need backup.

274
00:15:26,414 --> 00:15:28,793
What the fuck is this?
It's bullshit, mother fucker!

275
00:15:28,793 --> 00:15:30,461
Stay right there, Marcie.

276
00:15:30,461 --> 00:15:32,546
Fucking bullshit,
and you know it!

277
00:15:32,587 --> 00:15:35,006
- Stay there, Marcie.
- Don't go in my bedroom!

278
00:15:35,048 --> 00:15:38,844
This is bullshit, mother fucker!
Don't go down the hallway!

279
00:15:38,885 --> 00:15:40,929
Don't go down
my mother fucking hallway!

280
00:15:41,013 --> 00:15:42,181
LAPD!

281
00:15:42,222 --> 00:15:44,390
Don't go in my goddamn bedroom!

282
00:15:44,432 --> 00:15:46,519
Come out now with your hands up!

283
00:15:48,062 --> 00:15:50,605
What'd I tell you?
Ain't nobody in there!

284
00:15:50,648 --> 00:15:52,691
Where the fuck you going,
mother fucker?

285
00:15:52,732 --> 00:15:54,985
Don't go in my goddamn bedroom!

286
00:15:55,027 --> 00:15:57,028
Stay out of
my mother fucking closet!

287
00:15:57,028 --> 00:15:59,030
What'd I tell you?

288
00:15:59,072 --> 00:16:00,783
This is the police!

289
00:16:00,825 --> 00:16:05,995
If anyone is in this closet,
come out now with your hands up.

290
00:16:06,038 --> 00:16:09,625
Marcie, do not drag
that couch any further!

291
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:11,043
Don't do this, man!

292
00:16:11,043 --> 00:16:13,796
There's nobody
in my mother fucking closet!

293
00:16:13,837 --> 00:16:16,796
If I have to open this closet,
you will get shot!

294
00:16:16,837 --> 00:16:19,631
Come back here, mother fucker!

295
00:16:19,673 --> 00:16:22,051
What can't you goddamn
fucking talk to me?

296
00:16:22,092 --> 00:16:24,971
There's nobody in there!
I told you!

297
00:16:25,011 --> 00:16:26,514
Marcie, quiet down!

298
00:16:28,724 --> 00:16:30,684
This don't make
no fucking sense!

299
00:16:30,768 --> 00:16:33,229
This don't make
no goddamn sense!

300
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,690
This is bullshit, mother fucker!

301
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,399
Why can't you talk to me?

302
00:16:38,985 --> 00:16:42,404
What the hell is this, Marcie?

303
00:16:42,447 --> 00:16:44,740
That ain't mine.

304
00:16:45,783 --> 00:16:48,911
He's fucking dying
as we're sitting here.

305
00:16:48,952 --> 00:16:50,495
There's not a fucking ...

306
00:16:50,538 --> 00:16:52,581
Jesus, how can you tell me
to calm down?

307
00:16:52,623 --> 00:16:55,460
I can help you through this
the best way I know how ...

308
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,961
but there's certain things
you have to take care of.

309
00:16:57,961 --> 00:16:59,547
We can go over them ...

310
00:16:59,588 --> 00:17:01,340
but I need to know that
you're listening to me.

311
00:17:01,381 --> 00:17:03,884
I'm in a fucking state.

312
00:17:03,926 --> 00:17:05,924
It's like he's going,
and I don't know ...

313
00:17:05,967 --> 00:17:09,095
Just tell me practical things,
like what to do with his body.

314
00:17:09,136 --> 00:17:12,432
What do I do when he dies?
What happens then?

315
00:17:12,473 --> 00:17:14,308
That's what Hospice
can take care of for you.

316
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:16,310
They'll send over a nurse ...

317
00:17:16,352 --> 00:17:18,688
No. He has Phil now.

318
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:20,190
Phil's one of the nurses
from the service?

319
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:24,443
If you're happy with Phil
taking care of him, fine ...

320
00:17:24,527 --> 00:17:27,321
but contact Hospice
to arrange for the body.

321
00:17:27,363 --> 00:17:29,031
You don't understand.

322
00:17:29,074 --> 00:17:33,452
There's more pain, and the
fucking pills aren't working.

323
00:17:33,494 --> 00:17:37,039
The past two days,
he can't really swallow ...

324
00:17:37,082 --> 00:17:40,876
and I don't know
if the pills are going down.

325
00:17:40,876 --> 00:17:42,377
I can't see inside
his mouth anymore.

326
00:17:42,377 --> 00:17:44,506
I'm up all night
staring at him ...

327
00:17:44,547 --> 00:17:46,090
and I don't know
if the pills are going down.

328
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:47,884
He moans and he hurts.

329
00:17:47,884 --> 00:17:50,385
We can fix that,
because I can give you ...

330
00:17:50,427 --> 00:17:52,387
Are you listening?

331
00:17:52,387 --> 00:17:54,516
I'm listening.
I'm getting better.

332
00:17:54,557 --> 00:17:56,138
Do you want to sit down?

333
00:17:56,181 --> 00:17:57,766
I need to sit down.

334
00:18:01,978 --> 00:18:04,396
Linda,
Earl's not going to make it.

335
00:18:04,396 --> 00:18:07,901
He's dying. He is.
Very, very rapidly.

336
00:18:07,942 --> 00:18:11,821
The thing here is
to make this experience ...

337
00:18:11,863 --> 00:18:15,241
as painless and easy
for him as possible.

338
00:18:15,282 --> 00:18:17,035
You understand?

339
00:18:17,076 --> 00:18:21,163
Hospice will take care of
all the technical things.

340
00:18:21,205 --> 00:18:24,500
They will help you
and take care of the body.

341
00:18:24,542 --> 00:18:26,752
They are who you call
when he dies.

342
00:18:28,046 --> 00:18:29,881
There's the number of Hospice.

343
00:18:32,384 --> 00:18:35,929
Now, as far as
the morphine pills go ...

344
00:18:35,971 --> 00:18:37,931
there's something else
to consider.

345
00:18:37,972 --> 00:18:42,935
There's a very potent solution
of liquid morphine.

346
00:18:42,978 --> 00:18:46,144
And it's a little bottle,
has an eyedropper.

347
00:18:46,185 --> 00:18:48,646
Very easy to get into his mouth
and drop on his tongue ...

348
00:18:48,646 --> 00:18:51,775
and it will certainly diminish
the pain that he's in.

349
00:18:53,736 --> 00:18:57,823
But you need to realize
that once you give it to him ...

350
00:18:57,865 --> 00:19:00,200
there really is no going back.

351
00:19:00,241 --> 00:19:02,827
It will certainly cure his pain ...

352
00:19:02,869 --> 00:19:05,038
but he will drift
in and out of consciousness ...

353
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:08,125
even worse than he is now.

354
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:13,005
All sign of the recognizable
Earl will pretty much go away.

355
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,925
What the fuck can I say to that?

356
00:19:17,968 --> 00:19:19,761
I don't know
what to say to that.

357
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,232
I don't want to do this ...

358
00:19:34,902 --> 00:19:36,357
Sit here.

359
00:19:38,568 --> 00:19:41,614
I can see the thing, you know.

360
00:19:41,654 --> 00:19:44,657
It's getting there,
that's the cock sucker.

361
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:49,246
I see that pen.

362
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,414
I see it.
I know it's there.

363
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:53,000
I reach for it.

364
00:19:57,797 --> 00:19:59,923
No, no goddamn use.

365
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:03,969
I have a son, you know.

366
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:07,097
You do? Where is he?

367
00:20:07,138 --> 00:20:08,766
I don't know.

368
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:11,434
I mean ...

369
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:12,978
he's around.

370
00:20:14,188 --> 00:20:18,983
He's here in town,
but I don't know.

371
00:20:18,983 --> 00:20:21,319
You know ...

372
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:23,321
He's a tough one.

373
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:26,154
Very.

374
00:20:30,826 --> 00:20:32,161
Got a girlfriend, Phil?

375
00:20:33,371 --> 00:20:36,289
- Get a girlfriend.
- I'm trying.

376
00:20:36,332 --> 00:20:39,585
Do good things with her.
Share the things.

377
00:20:39,626 --> 00:20:42,380
All that bullshit is true.

378
00:20:42,422 --> 00:20:46,174
Find a good one,
hold on, and all that.

379
00:20:46,217 --> 00:20:47,884
Where's Linda?

380
00:20:47,926 --> 00:20:50,221
She went out
to run some errands.

381
00:20:50,262 --> 00:20:51,763
She'll be back.

382
00:20:51,806 --> 00:20:55,143
She's a good girl.

383
00:20:56,435 --> 00:21:00,940
She's a little nuts,
but she's a good girl, I think.

384
00:21:03,025 --> 00:21:05,236
She's a little daffy.

385
00:21:05,278 --> 00:21:07,363
She loves you.

386
00:21:07,404 --> 00:21:10,282
Well, maybe.

387
00:21:10,324 --> 00:21:14,453
Yeah. She's a good one.

388
00:21:14,494 --> 00:21:18,203
When's the last time
you talked to your son?

389
00:21:18,246 --> 00:21:21,165
I don't know.

390
00:21:21,207 --> 00:21:23,710
Ten.

391
00:21:23,751 --> 00:21:27,337
Maybe ten ...five.

392
00:21:30,467 --> 00:21:35,346
Fuck. Fuck.

393
00:21:35,387 --> 00:21:37,848
It's another thing that goes.

394
00:21:37,891 --> 00:21:39,308
Your memory?

395
00:21:39,308 --> 00:21:42,519
Time lines, you know?

396
00:21:42,561 --> 00:21:48,484
I can remember things,
but not right there.

397
00:21:48,526 --> 00:21:52,614
You know?
The fuck you know.

398
00:21:52,654 --> 00:21:54,656
I've seen it before.

399
00:21:54,699 --> 00:21:56,159
Other fucking assholes like me?

400
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,121
- There's no asshole like you.
- Cocksucker.

401
00:22:00,163 --> 00:22:01,998
How come every word you use ...

402
00:22:01,998 --> 00:22:04,250
is "cocksucker,"
"shit-balls," or "fuck"?

403
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:07,584
- Do me a personal favor.
- Go fuck myself.

404
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:10,921
You got it. God.

405
00:22:17,635 --> 00:22:19,846
I can't ...

406
00:22:19,887 --> 00:22:21,765
I can't hold on to this
any longer.

407
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:23,974
Want another morphine pill?

408
00:22:24,017 --> 00:22:26,103
No.
Give me the fucking phone.

409
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:27,645
Who you gonna call?

410
00:22:27,686 --> 00:22:31,732
I want to see this.
Where is he?

411
00:22:31,775 --> 00:22:33,734
- Who?
- Jack.

412
00:22:33,777 --> 00:22:37,447
Is Jack your son?

413
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:40,534
Do you want to call him
on the phone?

414
00:22:40,575 --> 00:22:43,494
I can dial the number
if you can remember it.

415
00:22:43,537 --> 00:22:44,954
It's not him.

416
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:48,666
It's not him.
He's a fucking asshole.

417
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:52,211
Phil, come here.
This is so boring.

418
00:22:52,253 --> 00:22:55,421
So goddamn ...

419
00:22:55,461 --> 00:22:58,298
That dying wish ...

420
00:22:58,339 --> 00:23:03,178
and all that
old-man-on-a-bed ...

421
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:06,932
wants one thing ...

422
00:23:06,973 --> 00:23:09,809
Find him on a ...

423
00:23:13,271 --> 00:23:16,733
Frank.

424
00:23:16,817 --> 00:23:21,779
His name's Frank Mackey.

425
00:23:23,824 --> 00:23:28,202
Frank Mackey?
That's your son?

426
00:23:28,244 --> 00:23:29,788
Not my name.

427
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:35,461
Go find ...

428
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:37,128
Find Lily.

429
00:23:38,963 --> 00:23:42,134
Give me that. Give me.

430
00:23:44,552 --> 00:23:48,179
Give me −
If you give me that ...

431
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:53,392
over there on ...

432
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:55,978
Fuck. I can't hold on to this.

433
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:57,938
I got it.

434
00:25:41,661 --> 00:25:44,788
Respect the cock.

435
00:25:46,833 --> 00:25:50,420
And tame the cunt!

436
00:25:53,464 --> 00:25:55,215
Tame it!

437
00:25:55,258 --> 00:25:56,759
Take it on head first
with the skills ...

438
00:25:56,759 --> 00:26:01,765
that I will teach you at work
and say no!

439
00:26:01,806 --> 00:26:04,267
You will not control me!
No!

440
00:26:04,267 --> 00:26:07,311
You will not take my soul!
No!

441
00:26:07,353 --> 00:26:10,022
You will not win this game!

442
00:26:10,065 --> 00:26:13,276
Because it's a game, guys.
You want to think it's not?

443
00:26:13,276 --> 00:26:15,317
Go back to the school yard ...

444
00:26:15,357 --> 00:26:19,863
and you have that crush
on big-titted Mary Jane.

445
00:26:23,825 --> 00:26:26,619
Respect the cock.

446
00:26:31,708 --> 00:26:34,711
You are embedding this thought.

447
00:26:34,752 --> 00:26:37,213
I am the one who's in charge.

448
00:26:38,714 --> 00:26:41,968
I am the one who says yes!

449
00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:43,470
No!

450
00:26:43,511 --> 00:26:45,971
Now!

451
00:26:46,013 --> 00:26:47,265
Here!

452
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,650
Because it's universal, man.

453
00:26:56,691 --> 00:26:59,486
It is evolutional.
It is anthropological.

454
00:26:59,528 --> 00:27:04,199
It is biological.
It is animal.

455
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,699
We ...

456
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,242
are ...

457
00:27:13,579 --> 00:27:15,164
men!

458
00:27:22,088 --> 00:27:23,589
You Gwenovier?

459
00:27:23,589 --> 00:27:25,384
I'm Captain Muffy,
Frank's personal assistant.

460
00:27:25,425 --> 00:27:28,261
This is Doc.
We can go in right down here.

461
00:27:28,303 --> 00:27:30,388
He started
about thirty-five minutes ago ...

462
00:27:30,431 --> 00:27:32,766
but he's probably getting
all pumped up right now.

463
00:27:32,807 --> 00:27:35,435
Look down
at the top of the page.

464
00:27:35,477 --> 00:27:37,354
What does it say?

465
00:27:37,395 --> 00:27:39,064
Get a calendar!

466
00:27:39,105 --> 00:27:41,942
That's right.
I cannot stress this enough.

467
00:27:41,942 --> 00:27:45,278
It's a simple item.
It's 99 cents at the store.

468
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:48,949
But if you look into your packs,
reach deep ...

469
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:53,662
you'll see I have been
nice enough to include one.

470
00:27:53,703 --> 00:27:57,538
That's just
the kind of prick I am.

471
00:27:57,579 --> 00:28:01,375
You need this calendar.
It doesn't seem like much.

472
00:28:01,416 --> 00:28:02,917
It's a simple, small item ...

473
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,672
but it is going to make all
the difference in your world.

474
00:28:06,713 --> 00:28:08,715
You meet a girl,
you work an A-3 interruption.

475
00:28:08,758 --> 00:28:12,344
Say, an eight-day waiting period
before next contact.

476
00:28:12,385 --> 00:28:14,805
How are you going to know
when those eight days are up?

477
00:28:14,846 --> 00:28:18,058
That's right.
You mark that calendar.

478
00:28:18,099 --> 00:28:21,644
You're going to stick with me
and this calendar ...

479
00:28:21,686 --> 00:28:23,189
and you're going to set goals.

480
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:26,357
If you really want to make
that friend something else ...

481
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,861
you have to be tough
on yourself.

482
00:28:28,861 --> 00:28:31,864
You have to set goals.

483
00:28:31,864 --> 00:28:34,282
You, sir,
in the brown short-sleeve shirt.

484
00:28:34,325 --> 00:28:36,701
I can't read your name tag.
What's your name?

485
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,751
Hi, is Frank there?

486
00:28:47,794 --> 00:28:49,921
No, you have the wrong number.

487
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:53,132
I'm sorry.
I'm looking for a Frank Mackey.

488
00:28:53,173 --> 00:28:55,718
There's no Frank here.

489
00:28:55,759 --> 00:29:00,890
Is this 818-775-3993?

490
00:29:00,932 --> 00:29:03,643
Yeah, but you have
the wrong number.

491
00:29:03,683 --> 00:29:07,688
Do you know a Jack,
by any chance?

492
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,275
Just a regular deal.
Loosers and tighters.

493
00:29:11,317 --> 00:29:13,693
- We're all set upstairs.
- Thanks.

494
00:29:13,736 --> 00:29:19,866
She called me up and asked me
for advice about a guy.

495
00:29:19,909 --> 00:29:22,161
- Got everything you need?
- All set.

496
00:29:22,202 --> 00:29:25,163
Does she know
how you feel about her?

497
00:29:25,205 --> 00:29:26,749
Yes. Absolutely.

498
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:29,085
And what did she say?

499
00:29:29,126 --> 00:29:32,505
She says she doesn't
feel that way about me.

500
00:29:32,547 --> 00:29:34,757
I don't think there's
anyone in this room ...

501
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:37,298
who doesn't understand
that kind of pain, Geoff ...

502
00:29:37,339 --> 00:29:39,550
and I want to thank you
for sharing that.

503
00:29:39,592 --> 00:29:41,594
Let me tell you what
we're going to teach Denise ...

504
00:29:41,635 --> 00:29:46,057
when we put our calendars
to work and set goals.

505
00:29:46,098 --> 00:29:48,434
What I say is, "Denise ..."

506
00:29:48,476 --> 00:29:50,603
"Denise the Piece."

507
00:29:50,644 --> 00:29:54,022
I mark it down.
I write it up.

508
00:29:54,065 --> 00:29:56,151
And you have been warned.

509
00:29:56,192 --> 00:29:59,487
Because I have my lasers ...

510
00:29:59,528 --> 00:30:02,156
I have my tasers,
I have my lCBMs ...

511
00:30:02,198 --> 00:30:07,162
I have my bazookas,
my jets pointed right at you.

512
00:30:07,202 --> 00:30:10,123
Because me and my brothers,
we like to celebrate.

513
00:30:10,164 --> 00:30:14,669
And on the first of May,
we celebrate V-Day.

514
00:30:17,797 --> 00:30:22,969
And come June, baby,
it is the lick of my spoon.

515
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:26,720
Come August,
we like to celebrate ...

516
00:30:26,761 --> 00:30:31,223
Saint Suck My Big Fat
Fucking Sausage!

517
00:30:31,223 --> 00:30:33,434
I set goals for myself ...

518
00:30:33,477 --> 00:30:35,770
and when I say I do not
want to take it anymore ...

519
00:30:35,811 --> 00:30:37,480
I will not take it anymore.

520
00:30:37,521 --> 00:30:40,692
You think
she's your friend, Geoff?

521
00:30:40,733 --> 00:30:42,068
They're not your friends.

522
00:30:42,109 --> 00:30:46,323
Do you really think she'll
be there when things go bad?

523
00:30:46,365 --> 00:30:49,409
When things go wrong,
think they'll be there for us?

524
00:30:49,451 --> 00:30:50,911
You think again.

525
00:30:50,951 --> 00:30:54,580
Fucking Denise,
Denise the Piece ...

526
00:30:54,623 --> 00:30:58,417
you're gonna give me that
cherry pie, sweet mama baby.

527
00:31:02,881 --> 00:31:05,133
Yeah, but listen up,
that is not to say ...

528
00:31:05,174 --> 00:31:07,551
that we don't all need
females just as friends ...

529
00:31:07,594 --> 00:31:09,387
because we'll learn later
in Chapter Twenty-three ...

530
00:31:09,429 --> 00:31:11,347
having a couple
of chick friends ...

531
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:13,392
comes in real handy
in setting jealousy traps.

532
00:31:13,432 --> 00:31:15,223
We'll get to that later.

533
00:31:15,265 --> 00:31:19,478
Right now, pull out
your blue booklets, page 18.

534
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,564
We're going quickly,
but we'll workshop it later.

535
00:31:22,605 --> 00:31:24,023
Eighteen, blue booklet.

536
00:31:26,984 --> 00:31:30,114
This is simple and clean,
and if done correctly ...

537
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:31,990
can be very effective
in getting some bush.

538
00:31:32,031 --> 00:31:33,534
Here we go.

539
00:31:33,534 --> 00:31:35,326
Call your so-called friend
and set a date.

540
00:31:35,368 --> 00:31:38,872
Make it around 7:30.
Call her on the phone.

541
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:07,105
Hi. Is Claudia here?

542
00:32:07,147 --> 00:32:10,526
She's sleeping.

543
00:32:10,567 --> 00:32:14,070
Are you her boyfriend?

544
00:32:14,113 --> 00:32:16,449
You're Jimmy Gator, right?

545
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:19,410
That's right.
What's your name?

546
00:32:19,451 --> 00:32:22,203
I'm Ray.

547
00:32:22,246 --> 00:32:23,580
So, are you her boyfriend?

548
00:32:23,622 --> 00:32:27,876
- No, I'm just a friend.
- I see.

549
00:32:27,917 --> 00:32:32,131
- What are you doing here?
- I'm her father.

550
00:32:32,173 --> 00:32:34,383
Mind if I come in?

551
00:32:34,424 --> 00:32:36,926
Sure.

552
00:32:36,969 --> 00:32:38,261
Thanks.

553
00:32:48,439 --> 00:32:49,898
What the fuck is this?

554
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:52,067
It's me, Claudia.

555
00:32:52,108 --> 00:32:55,817
What do you want?
Why are you here?

556
00:32:55,859 --> 00:32:59,822
I'd like to talk to you.
Your boyfriend let me in.

557
00:32:59,822 --> 00:33:03,451
That's not my boyfriend.
Want to call me a slut?

558
00:33:03,492 --> 00:33:05,702
No, I don't.

559
00:33:05,744 --> 00:33:07,663
What the fuck do you want?

560
00:33:07,663 --> 00:33:10,750
I want to sit and talk with you.

561
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:13,169
Don't sit down!

562
00:33:13,211 --> 00:33:16,338
I want to.
God, I want so many things.

563
00:33:16,381 --> 00:33:18,007
Maybe we could just talk
and straighten out ...

564
00:33:18,048 --> 00:33:19,384
I don't want to talk to you!

565
00:33:19,424 --> 00:33:21,344
I have to talk about
so many things.

566
00:33:21,385 --> 00:33:23,179
I don't want to talk to you!

567
00:33:23,221 --> 00:33:25,347
It doesn't have to be now.

568
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,848
We can make a date
to set some other time.

569
00:33:26,891 --> 00:33:29,685
I didn't mean to walk in on you
like this.

570
00:33:29,727 --> 00:33:32,939
Why are you here?
Why are you doing this?

571
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,898
You want to call me a whore?

572
00:33:34,941 --> 00:33:37,943
I don't want you to think
I'm that way to you.

573
00:33:37,984 --> 00:33:40,113
I won't call you a slut.

574
00:33:40,153 --> 00:33:44,616
Yeah, right.
What are you doing here?

575
00:33:44,659 --> 00:33:47,575
What the fuck are you
doing in my house?

576
00:33:47,575 --> 00:33:50,202
Please don't yell.
Honey, just don't go crazy.

577
00:33:50,244 --> 00:33:51,704
I'm not crazy!

578
00:33:51,746 --> 00:33:54,665
Don't you tell me
that I'm crazy!

579
00:33:54,708 --> 00:33:58,127
I'm sick, Claudia.

580
00:33:58,169 --> 00:33:59,336
Fuck you!

581
00:33:59,378 --> 00:34:01,172
No, please, listen to me.

582
00:34:01,213 --> 00:34:03,717
Listen to me right now, Claudia.

583
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:07,721
I am dying.
I got sick and I fell down ...

584
00:34:07,761 --> 00:34:11,766
Fuck you!
Get the fuck out of my house!

585
00:34:11,807 --> 00:34:16,396
I'm dying.
I have cancer, Claudia.

586
00:34:16,438 --> 00:34:18,106
And I'm dying very soon.

587
00:34:18,148 --> 00:34:19,606
Fuck you.

588
00:34:19,648 --> 00:34:22,610
It's metastasized in my bones.

589
00:34:22,652 --> 00:34:25,530
I'm not lying to you.
This is the truth.

590
00:34:25,572 --> 00:34:27,990
I'm telling you, Claudia,
I'm going to lose.

591
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:29,909
Get out.

592
00:34:32,369 --> 00:34:34,873
Get the fuck out of here!

593
00:34:34,913 --> 00:34:36,746
Get out! Go!

594
00:34:36,788 --> 00:34:38,789
Your mother would like
to hear from you.

595
00:34:38,831 --> 00:34:41,918
Fuck you. Get out!

596
00:34:43,503 --> 00:34:46,630
Get the fuck
out of my house now!

597
00:34:46,672 --> 00:34:47,923
Get out!

598
00:35:16,827 --> 00:35:18,121
Hey, Avi.

599
00:35:19,414 --> 00:35:21,083
Just one sec.

600
00:35:26,668 --> 00:35:29,672
- Please.
- Don't do this.

601
00:35:29,713 --> 00:35:32,590
This is so fucked, Solomon!
I don't deserve this!

602
00:35:32,632 --> 00:35:36,594
Don't get strong, Donnie.
This is making sense.

603
00:35:36,594 --> 00:35:39,056
This is making a lot of sense.

604
00:35:39,097 --> 00:35:42,309
You are not doing the job
I ask you to do.

605
00:35:42,351 --> 00:35:44,603
A job I give you.

606
00:35:44,644 --> 00:35:46,855
Over and over and over.

607
00:35:46,896 --> 00:35:49,608
I'm sorry, but I won't say
I'm sorry much more.

608
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:52,652
I don't have any money, Solomon.
If you fire me ...

609
00:35:52,695 --> 00:35:55,489
I pay you!
I give you a paycheck!

610
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:58,282
Your sales suck, Don!

611
00:35:58,324 --> 00:35:59,827
I give! I give!

612
00:35:59,827 --> 00:36:03,288
When I find you,
when I meet you, what?

613
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:05,164
I put your name up
on a fucking billboard.

614
00:36:05,206 --> 00:36:08,168
I put you in my store.
My salesman.

615
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:10,461
My fucking representation
of Solomon Solomon Electronic!

616
00:36:10,503 --> 00:36:12,715
The Quiz Kid Donnie Smith
from the game show!

617
00:36:12,755 --> 00:36:16,507
I lent you my celebrity,
my name! Exactly!

618
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,009
Fuck you! Fuck you!

619
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:21,012
I paid you! I paid you!

620
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:25,266
I gave you a fucking chance,
over and over, you let me down!

621
00:36:25,306 --> 00:36:27,434
I trust you with so much!

622
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:30,478
Keys to my store.
The codes to my locks.

623
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,356
The life and blood
of my business!

624
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:35,525
In return,
you smash in 7-Eleven!

625
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:37,820
Always late! Loans!

626
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,655
The loans I give you
for your kitchen you never did!

627
00:36:40,697 --> 00:36:41,990
I paid you back!

628
00:36:42,032 --> 00:36:44,617
Two years later
and from your paycheck!

629
00:36:44,659 --> 00:36:46,579
I never charged interest!

630
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:49,039
Solomon, please!

631
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:51,041
I am so fucked here
if you do this!

632
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:54,545
This is the worst timing
I could ever imagine!

633
00:36:54,586 --> 00:36:56,380
I need to keep working!

634
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:59,632
I have so many debts,
so many things ...

635
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:02,427
I have my surgery!

636
00:37:02,469 --> 00:37:04,927
- My oral surgery coming!
- What surgery?

637
00:37:04,969 --> 00:37:08,264
Oral surgery!
Corrective teeth surgery!

638
00:37:08,306 --> 00:37:10,766
- What is that?
- Braces!

639
00:37:10,807 --> 00:37:13,311
- You don't need braces.
- I do!

640
00:37:13,353 --> 00:37:16,731
- Your teeth are straight.
- I need surgery!

641
00:37:16,773 --> 00:37:19,733
You got struck by lightning
on vacation in Tahoe.

642
00:37:19,775 --> 00:37:21,193
I don't think braces
is a good idea.

643
00:37:21,235 --> 00:37:24,072
Solomon, just let me
ask you once, please.

644
00:37:24,112 --> 00:37:25,239
Please don't do this.

645
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,284
- How are you paying for them?
- I don't know!

646
00:37:28,326 --> 00:37:30,661
How much are braces anyway?

647
00:37:30,702 --> 00:37:33,164
It doesn't matter.

648
00:37:33,164 --> 00:37:35,123
It's like $5,000.
I've seen it.

649
00:37:35,166 --> 00:37:38,418
You're pissing me off.
This is fucking incredible.

650
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,838
You're paying $5,000
for braces you don't need?

651
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,882
- I've been a good worker.
- Don't do this!

652
00:37:43,925 --> 00:37:45,467
Where are you getting the money?

653
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:47,594
- I don't know!
- You were going to ask me!

654
00:37:47,637 --> 00:37:50,472
- I've been a good worker.
- No need for braces.

655
00:37:50,514 --> 00:37:51,849
That is none of your business!

656
00:37:51,891 --> 00:37:55,809
I've been a good worker for you,
you fucking assholes!

657
00:37:55,849 --> 00:37:57,184
Donnie, watch it now.

658
00:37:57,184 --> 00:37:58,519
Give me your keys.

659
00:37:58,519 --> 00:38:00,730
Give me your fucking keys!

660
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:14,786
Identified as Porter Parker,
age fifty-nine ...

661
00:38:14,827 --> 00:38:16,829
better known as
the dead guy in the closet.

662
00:38:16,871 --> 00:38:18,831
So says the building guy,
this is her husband.

663
00:38:18,873 --> 00:38:20,333
He doesn't live here.

664
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:22,835
Comes around, raises some shit,
screaming and yelling.

665
00:38:22,876 --> 00:38:24,713
There's a son and a kid.

666
00:38:24,753 --> 00:38:27,047
- Her son?
- Right. And the kid.

667
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:29,092
They were here,
and from late last night ...

668
00:38:29,092 --> 00:38:31,719
through the morning,
it was screaming and yelling.

669
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,014
- And where are they?
- Not to be found.

670
00:38:34,054 --> 00:38:37,057
Got $600 and a large box
of condoms next to the bed.

671
00:38:37,099 --> 00:38:39,601
- She was real belligerent.
- Three wedding rings.

672
00:38:39,643 --> 00:38:42,688
Guys coming in and out all day.
This from the building guy.

673
00:38:42,731 --> 00:38:46,313
He says the son and closet guy
are always going at it.

674
00:38:46,356 --> 00:38:49,483
- What is she saying?
- Not a goddamn thing.

675
00:38:52,445 --> 00:38:53,612
Thanks, Randy.

676
00:38:55,449 --> 00:38:57,284
How much you pay me for my help?

677
00:38:57,324 --> 00:38:59,619
It's more complicated than that,
little man.

678
00:38:59,661 --> 00:39:02,956
Put me on the payroll
and find out what's up.

679
00:39:02,998 --> 00:39:05,166
You don't just sign up
to be a police officer.

680
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:07,543
It's about
three years of training.

681
00:39:07,585 --> 00:39:09,588
I'm trained.
I'm ready to go.

682
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:13,342
- Want to buy some candy?
- Sorry, little man.

683
00:39:13,382 --> 00:39:15,677
You want to take my statement?
I'll perform for you.

684
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:19,056
Gotta get paid, though.

685
00:39:19,097 --> 00:39:21,099
Why aren't you in school today?

686
00:39:21,141 --> 00:39:23,518
No school today.
My teacher got sick.

687
00:39:23,518 --> 00:39:26,605
You don't have
substitute teachers at school?

688
00:39:26,646 --> 00:39:29,023
No.
What'd they find out in there?

689
00:39:29,023 --> 00:39:31,025
That's confidential information,
little man.

690
00:39:31,025 --> 00:39:33,612
Tell me what you know.
I'll tell you what I know.

691
00:39:33,652 --> 00:39:35,068
No can do.

692
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:38,905
Leave this to the detectives,
they ain't going to solve shit.

693
00:39:38,947 --> 00:39:41,699
I can help you.
Make you the man with the plan.

694
00:39:41,699 --> 00:39:45,036
Give you the gift that I flow.
Want to know who killed him?

695
00:39:45,036 --> 00:39:47,748
You come here.

696
00:39:47,789 --> 00:39:51,418
Come here. Want to disrespect
an officer of the law?

697
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:54,545
I can help you solve the case.
Tell you who did it.

698
00:39:54,588 --> 00:39:57,757
You're a joker, huh?
Telling me jokes?

699
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,887
- I'm a rapper.
- You're a rapper.

700
00:40:01,929 --> 00:40:04,889
- Got a record contract?
- Not yet.

701
00:40:04,931 --> 00:40:07,893
Give you a clue for the bust
if you show me some trust.

702
00:40:07,934 --> 00:40:09,228
You ever been to juvenile hall?

703
00:40:09,268 --> 00:40:10,771
I ain't fucking with you!

704
00:40:10,813 --> 00:40:13,481
Watch the mouth. Watch it.

705
00:40:13,523 --> 00:40:15,608
Come on, man, just watch me.

706
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:17,110
Watch and listen.

707
00:40:25,324 --> 00:40:26,449
Presence

708
00:40:26,492 --> 00:40:28,952
With a double-ass meaning
gifts I bestow

709
00:40:28,952 --> 00:40:31,454
With my riff and my flow,
but you don't hear me, though

710
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:32,831
Think fast, catch me, yo

711
00:40:32,873 --> 00:40:35,166
Because I throw what I know
with a resonance

712
00:40:35,208 --> 00:40:37,420
For your trouble-ass fiend
in weening yourself

713
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,795
Off the back of the shelf

714
00:40:38,838 --> 00:40:41,798
Jackass,
crackers, bodystackers

715
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,217
Dick-tooting niggers,
masturbating your triggers ...

716
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:47,429
Hold it, homeboy.
I don't need to hear that word.

717
00:40:47,471 --> 00:40:49,639
Living to get older
with a chip on your shoulder

718
00:40:49,681 --> 00:40:51,809
Except you think you got a grip

719
00:40:51,851 --> 00:40:53,309
Because your hip got a holster

720
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:56,480
Ain't no confessor, so, busta,
you better just shut the fuck up

721
00:40:56,521 --> 00:40:58,065
Try to listen and learn ...

722
00:40:58,106 --> 00:41:00,150
Cut it, Coolio.

723
00:41:00,192 --> 00:41:02,485
I've had enough of
the mouth and the language.

724
00:41:02,527 --> 00:41:04,195
I'm almost done!

725
00:41:04,237 --> 00:41:06,197
Finish it up without the lip.

726
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:07,699
Check that ego

727
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:09,827
Come off it, I'm the prophet

728
00:41:09,869 --> 00:41:12,246
The professor,
I'm-a teach you about the worm

729
00:41:12,288 --> 00:41:14,289
Who eventually
turned to catch wreck

730
00:41:14,331 --> 00:41:16,414
With the neck of
a long-time oppressor

731
00:41:16,456 --> 00:41:19,751
And he's running from the devil,
but the debt is always gaining

732
00:41:19,791 --> 00:41:22,670
And if he's worth being hurt,
he's worth bringing pain in

733
00:41:22,711 --> 00:41:25,797
When the sunshine don't work,
the good Lord bring the rain in

734
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,760
Now, that shit will help you
solve the case.

735
00:41:32,554 --> 00:41:35,349
Whatever that meant.

736
00:41:35,391 --> 00:41:37,726
I'm sure it's real helpful,
Ice-T.

737
00:41:39,353 --> 00:41:41,146
Did you listen to me?

738
00:41:41,188 --> 00:41:43,440
I was listening to you.

739
00:41:43,483 --> 00:41:47,070
I told you who did it,
and you're not even listening.

740
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:49,237
I'm through playing games.

741
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,282
Be cool.
Stay in school.

742
00:41:52,324 --> 00:41:55,244
Get out of the street now.

743
00:41:55,286 --> 00:41:57,079
Move it.

744
00:43:02,347 --> 00:43:04,766
- Come on, let's go.
- You're late, not me.

745
00:43:04,807 --> 00:43:07,768
- You could have been in front.
- I didn't see you.

746
00:43:07,811 --> 00:43:12,315
Why didn't you just −
You could've come in the front.

747
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:14,860
Hurry up.

748
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,695
All right,
you ready to keep winning?

749
00:43:16,737 --> 00:43:17,903
Sure.

750
00:43:32,626 --> 00:43:33,836
You OK?

751
00:43:35,922 --> 00:43:39,300
Almost busted my ankle there.

752
00:43:39,342 --> 00:43:43,096
Have that makeup lady
fix your hair.

753
00:43:43,137 --> 00:43:44,514
It's really wet.

754
00:43:44,556 --> 00:43:46,221
There you are!

755
00:43:46,262 --> 00:43:48,974
- I'm sorry we're late.
- That's all right.

756
00:43:49,016 --> 00:43:50,559
We got caught in traffic.

757
00:43:50,601 --> 00:43:51,768
Your book's OK.

758
00:43:51,809 --> 00:43:54,103
- How you doing?
- I'm fine.

759
00:43:54,146 --> 00:43:55,773
Ready to go, go, go?

760
00:43:55,813 --> 00:43:58,900
Do you know anybody involved
in that Alan Thicke thing?

761
00:43:58,942 --> 00:44:01,570
The Corey Haim terrorist
in the high school?

762
00:44:01,612 --> 00:44:03,489
Where's Richard and Julia?

763
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:05,824
They're here.
They're fine.

764
00:44:05,865 --> 00:44:08,159
They're in the dressing room,
so we're all set.

765
00:44:08,202 --> 00:44:10,329
- See you later.
- Go to it, handsome.

766
00:44:10,371 --> 00:44:12,873
- See you.
- OK, buddy, love you.

767
00:44:14,708 --> 00:44:17,710
- Good luck, Rick.
- Hey, Peter.

768
00:44:17,753 --> 00:44:19,253
Dick. I'm sorry. Dick.

769
00:44:19,295 --> 00:44:22,465
Fuck.
Can't get that fucking name.

770
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,760
Who's ready to beat the record?

771
00:44:25,802 --> 00:44:27,346
That was close.

772
00:44:27,387 --> 00:44:29,472
It's cats
and fucking dogs out there.

773
00:44:29,514 --> 00:44:30,932
Cats and dogs indeed.

774
00:44:30,974 --> 00:44:33,143
I've never seen it rain
this bad since last year.

775
00:44:33,184 --> 00:44:36,686
Because of La Nina or El Nino
or whatever the shit.

776
00:44:36,726 --> 00:44:40,690
No bueno El Nino.
Sorry I'm late.

777
00:44:40,731 --> 00:44:43,567
- What was your name again?
- Amy, Mr. Jennings.

778
00:44:43,567 --> 00:44:45,568
Call me D.J.
Listen.

779
00:44:45,568 --> 00:44:48,864
Trust me.
Stay focused.

780
00:44:48,905 --> 00:44:50,615
Where's the news department
at the studio?

781
00:44:50,657 --> 00:44:53,034
- It's upstairs.
- Have you ever been there?

782
00:44:53,077 --> 00:44:54,244
Sure. Why?

783
00:44:54,286 --> 00:44:56,414
I was wondering about
the weather department.

784
00:44:56,454 --> 00:45:00,376
If they have outside
meteorological services ...

785
00:45:00,458 --> 00:45:02,335
or if they have
in-house instruments.

786
00:45:02,378 --> 00:45:05,755
I can check on that for you,
and later we can take a tour.

787
00:45:05,797 --> 00:45:07,257
Sounds good?

788
00:45:07,298 --> 00:45:09,092
You asking because
it's raining outside?

789
00:45:09,135 --> 00:45:10,760
I guess.

790
00:45:10,802 --> 00:45:14,014
Whatever's happening,
that's what you look into?

791
00:45:14,056 --> 00:45:16,016
I don't know.

792
00:45:16,057 --> 00:45:19,311
You don't know?
It's not a bad way to be.

793
00:45:19,353 --> 00:45:22,315
Interested in everything
that's going around.

794
00:45:22,315 --> 00:45:24,650
Wet is wet.
Just that simple.

795
00:45:24,692 --> 00:45:28,067
- Hi, Mary.
- Hi, hon, Stanley.

796
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:51,965
Rose is on the phone.
Here are today's cards.

797
00:45:52,007 --> 00:45:53,760
Fifteen minutes to go over
those cards.

798
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,510
- Sorry.
- Find Paula for me.

799
00:45:55,552 --> 00:45:59,056
Now? We're on the air
in twenty minutes.

800
00:45:59,097 --> 00:46:01,809
Fucking hell, Mary.
Yeah? Hi.

801
00:46:01,851 --> 00:46:05,396
- Hi, how you doing?
- I'm drinking.

802
00:46:05,438 --> 00:46:08,900
- Slowly or quickly?
- As fast as I can.

803
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:11,777
You come home
soon after the show.

804
00:46:11,818 --> 00:46:13,487
I went to see her.

805
00:46:13,528 --> 00:46:16,278
Some asshole answers
the door in his underwear.

806
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,864
He's fifty years old.

807
00:46:17,905 --> 00:46:20,074
There's coke and shit
laid out on the table.

808
00:46:20,115 --> 00:46:22,077
Did she talk to you?

809
00:46:22,117 --> 00:46:24,536
She went fucking crazy, Rose.

810
00:46:24,579 --> 00:46:26,873
- Did you tell her?
- I don't know.

811
00:46:26,914 --> 00:46:28,625
I gotta go.
I don't have time.

812
00:46:28,666 --> 00:46:31,378
Got a lot more drinking to do.

813
00:46:31,418 --> 00:46:34,755
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

814
00:46:34,797 --> 00:46:36,757
Shit.

815
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,510
Fuck.

816
00:47:38,065 --> 00:47:41,445
Police! Open the door!

817
00:47:41,485 --> 00:47:43,070
Who is it?

818
00:47:43,112 --> 00:47:46,365
LAPD! Open the door!

819
00:47:47,451 --> 00:47:49,577
I'm coming!

820
00:47:49,619 --> 00:47:51,788
I have to get dressed!

821
00:47:53,539 --> 00:47:56,956
You're not coming fast enough!
Open the door!

822
00:47:56,998 --> 00:47:58,458
Didn't you hear me?

823
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,461
I said I'm coming
and that means I'm coming!

824
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:04,172
I just have to get dressed,
all right?

825
00:48:04,213 --> 00:48:06,925
I have to get dressed!

826
00:48:17,143 --> 00:48:19,688
I hate coming here
and not being able to talk.

827
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,940
It's fine.
I understand.

828
00:48:21,981 --> 00:48:24,360
I wish the circumstance
was better.

829
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,985
I don't know
what's going to happen.

830
00:48:26,027 --> 00:48:28,280
I feel so over the top
with everything.

831
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:30,199
Running out of
your medication at all ...

832
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:32,659
let alone at a time like this,
could be drastic.

833
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:34,452
Thank you, Dr. Diane.

834
00:48:57,014 --> 00:48:59,016
Stanley Spector
and his brilliant friends ...

835
00:48:59,057 --> 00:49:01,936
Richard and Julia can defeat
today's adult challengers ...

836
00:49:01,978 --> 00:49:04,688
Mim, Luis, and Todd.

837
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:07,358
They're moving towards a half
million dollar team total ...

838
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,860
and a "What Do Kids Know?" record!

839
00:49:09,902 --> 00:49:11,403
Pink Dot.

840
00:49:11,403 --> 00:49:13,489
Hi. I'd like to get
an order for delivery.

841
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:16,951
- Phone number?
- 818-725-4424.

842
00:49:16,992 --> 00:49:19,577
Partridge?
What would you like?

843
00:49:19,619 --> 00:49:23,123
I'd like to get an order
of peanut butter ...

844
00:49:23,164 --> 00:49:27,711
cigarettes,
Camel Lights, water ...

845
00:49:27,753 --> 00:49:29,797
Bottled water?

846
00:49:29,838 --> 00:49:31,548
No. You know what,
forget the water.

847
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:35,590
Just give me a loaf of bread.
White bread.

848
00:49:35,632 --> 00:49:40,262
And do you have
"Playboy" magazine?

849
00:49:40,304 --> 00:49:42,347
One of those.

850
00:49:42,389 --> 00:49:44,766
And "Penthouse," the magazine?

851
00:49:44,809 --> 00:49:47,894
You have that?
One of those.

852
00:49:47,936 --> 00:49:51,481
And "Hustler"?

853
00:49:51,523 --> 00:49:52,942
Do you have that?

854
00:49:52,983 --> 00:49:56,612
- Yes, I said. That it?
- That's it.

855
00:49:56,653 --> 00:49:59,740
Still want the peanut butter,
bread, and cigarettes?

856
00:49:59,782 --> 00:50:02,242
Yeah. What?

857
00:50:02,284 --> 00:50:05,121
The total is 31.90.
Thirty minutes or less.

858
00:50:05,163 --> 00:50:06,581
Thank you.

859
00:50:06,623 --> 00:50:09,166
- Cash or credit card?
- Cash.

860
00:50:09,208 --> 00:50:10,543
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

861
00:50:23,347 --> 00:50:26,972
Respect the cock
and tame the cunt!

862
00:50:27,014 --> 00:50:28,266
Have a great lunch!

863
00:50:32,978 --> 00:50:34,938
This is Gwenovier
from the show "Profiles."

864
00:50:34,981 --> 00:50:36,483
She's here for the interview.

865
00:50:36,523 --> 00:50:39,027
- It's nice to meet you.
- I admire your work.

866
00:50:39,027 --> 00:50:41,028
Thank you.
I have us set up ...

867
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:42,864
It's not very safe for you here.

868
00:50:42,905 --> 00:50:45,492
I finish one of
these seminars, Gwenovier ...

869
00:50:45,574 --> 00:50:49,996
I swear to fucking God,
I am Batman.

870
00:50:50,038 --> 00:50:51,748
I'm Superman.

871
00:50:51,789 --> 00:50:56,251
I'm like a fucking action hero,
the way I feel after that.

872
00:50:56,251 --> 00:50:58,880
I could walk outta this room
right now, Gwenovier ...

873
00:50:58,922 --> 00:51:01,215
go down the hall,
walk down the street ...

874
00:51:01,257 --> 00:51:03,217
and I could pick up
any sweet little honey ...

875
00:51:03,259 --> 00:51:05,135
that has even one second
to stop.

876
00:51:05,177 --> 00:51:07,889
- One second?
- Just one second, girl.

877
00:51:07,931 --> 00:51:09,641
One glance, one hesitation ...

878
00:51:09,682 --> 00:51:14,893
one subtle look my way
for me to know ...

879
00:51:14,936 --> 00:51:18,480
and then it is
bing, bang, boom.

880
00:51:18,521 --> 00:51:23,275
Oh, my God!
I'm away on a tangent.

881
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:25,487
I tell you ...

882
00:51:25,528 --> 00:51:27,780
Don't hurt yourself, OK?

883
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:30,617
I tell you, I do.

884
00:51:30,659 --> 00:51:33,202
I get so fucking jazzed
at these seminars ...

885
00:51:33,244 --> 00:51:36,623
because I am what I believe.

886
00:51:36,664 --> 00:51:38,666
I do as I say.

887
00:51:38,666 --> 00:51:42,170
I live by these rules ...

888
00:51:42,211 --> 00:51:44,463
as religiously as I preach them.

889
00:51:44,505 --> 00:51:46,465
That's why I am getting
the nasty ...

890
00:51:46,507 --> 00:51:48,342
left, right, center,
up, down, sideways.

891
00:51:48,385 --> 00:51:51,429
The Battle of the Bush is being
fought and won by Team Mackey.

892
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:56,309
We'll start rolling now.

893
00:51:56,351 --> 00:51:58,894
What?
I thought we were rolling.

894
00:51:58,936 --> 00:52:03,942
Come on, go, go, go, Gwenovier.
I am firing pearls at you here.

895
00:52:03,983 --> 00:52:06,775
I want you to know that I'm not
succeeding in the bush ...

896
00:52:06,817 --> 00:52:08,818
because I'm Frank T.J. Mackey.

897
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:10,320
You think about this.

898
00:52:10,362 --> 00:52:13,699
There are women ...

899
00:52:13,699 --> 00:52:17,452
who want to destroy me.

900
00:52:17,494 --> 00:52:21,164
No. I find that hard to believe.

901
00:52:22,373 --> 00:52:24,960
It makes it very difficult,
twice as hard for me.

902
00:52:25,001 --> 00:52:27,045
There's some little hottie
I'm moving in on ...

903
00:52:27,086 --> 00:52:33,052
knows me, knows my plans
and my schemes, you know?

904
00:52:33,092 --> 00:52:34,844
She'll want to fuck with me.

905
00:52:34,887 --> 00:52:38,056
She'll go back,
tell her friends.

906
00:52:38,097 --> 00:52:40,934
"Frank T.J. Mackey,
he ain't all that.

907
00:52:40,976 --> 00:52:42,894
He ain't all that.
Didn't get me."

908
00:52:42,936 --> 00:52:45,188
So, me, I am ...

909
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:48,067
I'm just on full after burners ...

910
00:52:48,108 --> 00:52:50,568
full throttle
through hottie heaven.

911
00:52:50,610 --> 00:52:53,864
- Just dodging left ...
- Yes, I understand.

912
00:52:53,905 --> 00:52:57,155
These bullets
from these terrorists.

913
00:52:57,197 --> 00:52:59,074
Babe, beauties.

914
00:52:59,115 --> 00:53:02,327
Calm down, take it easy,
and be a good boy ...

915
00:53:02,369 --> 00:53:04,704
OK, Mr. Mackey?

916
00:53:04,746 --> 00:53:06,623
Thank you.
You sit back there ...

917
00:53:06,666 --> 00:53:09,626
put your microphone
on for me, please.

918
00:53:09,668 --> 00:53:11,336
So we can do this thing,
all right?

919
00:53:11,378 --> 00:53:12,545
Yes, ma'am.

920
00:53:20,262 --> 00:53:22,514
Let me start by asking you ...

921
00:53:22,556 --> 00:53:24,391
Just one second.

922
00:53:28,813 --> 00:53:30,731
You missed a button.

923
00:53:32,315 --> 00:53:33,900
Thank you.

924
00:53:38,489 --> 00:53:40,199
What do you want to know?

925
00:53:52,416 --> 00:53:53,876
Make it happen.

926
00:53:53,876 --> 00:53:57,547
This is you, Donnie.
Go, go, go!

927
00:54:42,297 --> 00:54:44,590
Hello.
You're back again, huh?

928
00:54:44,632 --> 00:54:46,717
Yes.
Hi. How are you?

929
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,762
- What can I get you?
- A Diet Coke.

930
00:55:37,349 --> 00:55:39,976
You look tired.
Want one of these?

931
00:55:40,018 --> 00:55:42,980
Better pour you
one of these, huh?

932
00:55:43,021 --> 00:55:44,856
Can you ring me up?

933
00:55:51,905 --> 00:55:54,157
- Brad, good to see you.
- It's good to see you.

934
00:55:54,199 --> 00:55:56,742
You make that
down payment on Harley yet?

935
00:55:56,784 --> 00:55:59,663
Not yet.
I'll make it next week.

936
00:55:59,704 --> 00:56:01,289
You ever get out of here?

937
00:56:01,331 --> 00:56:04,126
Six days a week.
You'll be the first to go.

938
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:08,130
I would love that.

939
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:10,840
- Want another one?
- Yes, please.

940
00:56:22,224 --> 00:56:24,143
I'd like a tequila.

941
00:56:24,143 --> 00:56:26,144
- What kind?
- It doesn't matter.

942
00:56:37,822 --> 00:56:39,742
Open up the door now!

943
00:56:41,659 --> 00:56:43,746
Yes, hi! Hello!

944
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:51,711
I'm sorry.
I had to get dressed.

945
00:56:52,838 --> 00:56:54,340
You the resident here?

946
00:56:55,882 --> 00:56:57,217
You alone in there?

947
00:56:58,344 --> 00:57:00,012
There's no one else
in there with you?

948
00:57:02,889 --> 00:57:05,222
What's wrong?

949
00:57:05,264 --> 00:57:09,059
First of all,
turn down the music ...

950
00:57:09,101 --> 00:57:11,646
so we can have a conversation.

951
00:57:26,619 --> 00:57:27,994
You mind if I come in?

952
00:57:28,036 --> 00:57:30,873
No. Go ahead.

953
00:57:40,298 --> 00:57:43,552
You got your neighbors
real worried for you.

954
00:57:43,594 --> 00:57:45,721
Sorry.

955
00:57:45,762 --> 00:57:47,222
You live alone?

956
00:57:47,264 --> 00:57:48,724
- What's your name?
- Claudia.

957
00:57:48,766 --> 00:57:52,018
- Claudia what?
- Wilson.

958
00:57:52,061 --> 00:57:54,021
Claudia Wilson ...

959
00:57:54,063 --> 00:57:56,311
are you trying to go deaf?

960
00:57:56,353 --> 00:57:58,606
What?

961
00:57:58,648 --> 00:58:00,275
Did you hear what I just said?

962
00:58:00,315 --> 00:58:02,943
Yes, but I don't know what ...

963
00:58:02,985 --> 00:58:06,155
You're listening
to your music so loud ...

964
00:58:06,197 --> 00:58:08,657
you're going to damage
your ears.

965
00:58:10,994 --> 00:58:13,663
You continue to listen
to your music at that level ...

966
00:58:13,704 --> 00:58:16,373
then you're going to damage
not only your ears ...

967
00:58:16,416 --> 00:58:18,626
but your neighbors' ears
as well.

968
00:58:18,668 --> 00:58:20,503
I didn't realize
it was that loud.

969
00:58:20,545 --> 00:58:25,717
That right there is the first
sign of hearing loss.

970
00:58:28,385 --> 00:58:31,222
I see you got
your TV on there, too.

971
00:58:31,264 --> 00:58:33,849
You usually keep that on
at the same time?

972
00:58:33,891 --> 00:58:37,519
I don't know.
What is this?

973
00:58:38,771 --> 00:58:40,981
You been doing
some drugs today, Claudia?

974
00:58:43,568 --> 00:58:45,608
Have you been doing
some drinking?

975
00:58:50,572 --> 00:58:54,284
I got a call
of a disturbance here.

976
00:58:54,326 --> 00:58:58,371
Some loud music − "A" ...

977
00:58:58,413 --> 00:59:00,164
Some screaming and yelling.

978
00:59:00,206 --> 00:59:02,500
Has there been some
screaming and yelling here?

979
00:59:07,422 --> 00:59:10,550
I had someone come to my door.

980
00:59:10,592 --> 00:59:13,094
Someone that I didn't
want to hear.

981
00:59:13,135 --> 00:59:19,516
And I told them to leave,
so it's no big deal.

982
00:59:19,559 --> 00:59:22,978
They left. I'm sorry.

983
00:59:23,021 --> 00:59:24,438
Was that your boyfriend?

984
00:59:26,358 --> 00:59:28,735
You don't have a boyfriend?

985
00:59:32,447 --> 00:59:34,114
Well, who was it?

986
00:59:34,157 --> 00:59:37,574
I was − He's gone.

987
00:59:37,615 --> 00:59:40,786
I mean, it's not −
It's over, you know?

988
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:50,295
Mind if I have a look around
for your safety?

989
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:52,005
It's fine.

990
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:56,092
What are you looking for?

991
00:59:56,134 --> 01:00:00,304
Claudia, why don't you let me
handle the questions ...

992
01:00:00,347 --> 01:00:03,557
and you handle the answers?

993
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:05,101
I'm here to help you.

994
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:09,398
Do you still
have to do homework?

995
01:00:09,438 --> 01:00:10,898
Not as much as I used to.

996
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:13,402
Since we started,
I haven't gone to school much.

997
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:14,902
I've had so many auditions.

998
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:16,405
I don't have
regular classes anymore.

999
01:00:16,445 --> 01:00:17,739
What do you do?

1000
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,949
They let me have
my own study time ...

1001
01:00:19,992 --> 01:00:21,827
my own reading time
in the library.

1002
01:00:21,867 --> 01:00:23,036
That's pretty cool.

1003
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:25,411
Do you have an agent, Stanley?

1004
01:00:25,452 --> 01:00:26,911
You should get one.
I'm serious.

1005
01:00:26,954 --> 01:00:28,746
You could get a lot
of stuff outta this.

1006
01:00:28,789 --> 01:00:30,081
Like what?

1007
01:00:30,123 --> 01:00:32,585
Like endorsements and shit!

1008
01:00:32,626 --> 01:00:35,086
Bite it, Cynthia.
You can get free stuff ...

1009
01:00:35,086 --> 01:00:37,172
from people who want you
to endorse their product.

1010
01:00:37,213 --> 01:00:39,842
Commercials, a sitcom,
an M.O.W. or something.

1011
01:00:39,882 --> 01:00:41,050
What's M.O.W.?

1012
01:00:41,092 --> 01:00:42,844
Hello! Movie of the week.

1013
01:00:42,885 --> 01:00:45,431
I went for one this morning
with Alan Thicke and Corey Haim.

1014
01:00:45,472 --> 01:00:46,931
Was it a callback?

1015
01:00:46,974 --> 01:00:48,976
No. But I'll probably
get a callback.

1016
01:00:48,976 --> 01:00:51,478
If we beat the record,
you might get a callback.

1017
01:00:51,478 --> 01:00:53,480
I'll get it because
I'm a good actress, Richard.

1018
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:56,442
- Saucy, saucy!
- Guys, settle down.

1019
01:00:56,483 --> 01:00:58,443
- Cynthia?
- What?

1020
01:00:58,485 --> 01:01:01,487
- I gotta go to the bathroom.
- Can you hold it?

1021
01:01:01,530 --> 01:01:04,032
Yes siree!

1022
01:01:04,074 --> 01:01:07,911
That was absolutely fantastic,
and I thank you very much.

1023
01:01:07,952 --> 01:01:09,413
As a matter of fact ...

1024
01:01:09,454 --> 01:01:11,414
we may take you folks
on the road with us ...

1025
01:01:11,456 --> 01:01:12,916
That's my thing.

1026
01:01:12,958 --> 01:01:14,833
I'm serious.
Milk and sports, man.

1027
01:01:14,833 --> 01:01:17,376
You never heard milk and sports?

1028
01:01:17,418 --> 01:01:20,253
Anything baseball
or dealing with numbers ...

1029
01:01:20,295 --> 01:01:23,925
when it comes to those
or who broke whatever record.

1030
01:01:23,965 --> 01:01:27,385
Any kind of dairy product
or dairy recipe.

1031
01:01:27,427 --> 01:01:30,556
Like goat milk, goat cheese,
all that stuff.

1032
01:01:30,597 --> 01:01:32,432
Check this out over here.

1033
01:01:32,474 --> 01:01:35,353
So, guys,
just work with me on that.

1034
01:01:35,393 --> 01:01:38,146
Excuse me, can you bring me
low fat milk, please?

1035
01:01:38,188 --> 01:01:39,981
A couple of ice cubes.

1036
01:01:40,023 --> 01:01:41,943
They don't look so tough.

1037
01:01:41,983 --> 01:01:44,277
Do they look smart?

1038
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:46,322
What are they going to do,
beat us?

1039
01:01:46,405 --> 01:01:47,614
Maybe.

1040
01:01:47,657 --> 01:01:51,452
We're not going out two days
before we set the record.

1041
01:01:51,494 --> 01:01:55,373
They want us done, they'll call
in the Harvard SWAT team.

1042
01:01:56,539 --> 01:01:58,000
Ready to run.

1043
01:02:12,594 --> 01:02:15,597
- You smell like trouble.
- I'm fucking hammered.

1044
01:02:15,639 --> 01:02:17,224
You OK?

1045
01:02:17,266 --> 01:02:19,601
Good. You have a chance
to look those over?

1046
01:02:19,601 --> 01:02:22,563
It's the same fucking shit
for thirty years, Burt.

1047
01:02:25,483 --> 01:02:28,277
You look like you have money
in your pocket.

1048
01:02:30,487 --> 01:02:34,367
Maybe I'm just happy to see
my friend Brad there.

1049
01:02:34,409 --> 01:02:37,619
Just throw some money around.

1050
01:02:37,661 --> 01:02:39,746
Money, money, money.

1051
01:02:41,164 --> 01:02:43,626
This sounds threatening.

1052
01:02:43,668 --> 01:02:46,003
Do you have love in your heart?

1053
01:02:46,045 --> 01:02:48,088
I have love all over.

1054
01:02:48,130 --> 01:02:50,757
I even have love for you,
friend.

1055
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:53,302
Is it real love?

1056
01:02:53,344 --> 01:02:54,967
The kind of love
that makes you feel ...

1057
01:02:55,010 --> 01:02:59,472
that intangible joy
in the pit of your stomach ...

1058
01:02:59,514 --> 01:03:02,516
like a bucket of acid and nerves
running around ...

1059
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:05,936
making you hurt
and happy and all over ...

1060
01:03:05,978 --> 01:03:08,565
You're head over heels?

1061
01:03:08,606 --> 01:03:12,902
You lost me with the last
couple of cocktail words ...

1062
01:03:12,943 --> 01:03:15,614
but I believe
it's that sort of love.

1063
01:03:15,655 --> 01:03:17,615
Sounds nice to me.

1064
01:03:20,452 --> 01:03:21,869
I have love.

1065
01:03:21,911 --> 01:03:23,996
A very chatty kind.
Indeed you do.

1066
01:03:24,039 --> 01:03:26,916
No, I mean I'm telling you.

1067
01:03:26,958 --> 01:03:28,918
I have love.

1068
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:32,713
Yes, and I'm listening
avidly, fellow.

1069
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:40,347
My name is Donnie Smith,
and I have lots of love to give.

1070
01:03:59,987 --> 01:04:01,949
Lots of stuff here, huh?

1071
01:04:29,643 --> 01:04:32,436
It's thirty seconds.

1072
01:04:32,478 --> 01:04:34,231
Got my eye on you.
I'll be back.

1073
01:04:41,985 --> 01:04:43,945
What the fuck's
going on over there?

1074
01:04:43,987 --> 01:04:45,780
I gotta go to the bathroom.

1075
01:04:45,822 --> 01:04:47,282
Jesus Christ, Stanley!

1076
01:04:47,324 --> 01:04:49,617
No, you cannot do that.

1077
01:04:49,659 --> 01:04:51,619
Let me explain something
to you people.

1078
01:04:51,661 --> 01:04:53,956
You have to tone it.
Don't be real aggressive.

1079
01:04:53,998 --> 01:04:57,458
You have to be subtly abusive
so they don't know it.

1080
01:04:57,501 --> 01:05:00,336
"No, you're not going outside
and play with your friends ...

1081
01:05:00,378 --> 01:05:02,965
"until that entire room
is cleaned floor to ceiling."

1082
01:05:03,007 --> 01:05:04,800
Julia's room's the same way.

1083
01:05:04,842 --> 01:05:07,719
Like a pigsty.
But it's out fits now.

1084
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:11,889
You should have seen what she
had on walking out the door!

1085
01:05:11,931 --> 01:05:14,934
I said, "We're going to school,
not a fashion show."

1086
01:05:14,934 --> 01:05:18,981
It's not a fashion show.
It's school, for goodness sake!

1087
01:05:19,023 --> 01:05:21,983
Let's make some fucking
money here, people.

1088
01:05:22,025 --> 01:05:23,693
You with me, Jimmy?

1089
01:05:23,735 --> 01:05:26,652
The book says, "We may be
through with the past ...

1090
01:05:26,693 --> 01:05:28,612
"but the past
ain't through with us."

1091
01:05:28,612 --> 01:05:32,240
"We met upon the level, and
we're parting on the square."

1092
01:05:32,282 --> 01:05:33,992
In my fucking sleep, Burt.

1093
01:05:35,994 --> 01:05:40,625
And five, four, three, two ...

1094
01:05:42,585 --> 01:05:45,295
Live,
from Burbank, California ...

1095
01:05:45,295 --> 01:05:47,340
it's "What Do Kids Know?"

1096
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:49,300
Going into our
thirty-third year on the air ...

1097
01:05:49,342 --> 01:05:51,427
it's America's
longest-running quiz show ...

1098
01:05:51,510 --> 01:05:54,472
and the place where three kids
get to challenge three adults ...

1099
01:05:54,512 --> 01:05:57,349
and in the end,
we'll see who's the boss.

1100
01:05:57,391 --> 01:06:00,311
Moving towards their eighth
consecutive week as champions ...

1101
01:06:00,353 --> 01:06:03,773
we have the kids −
Richard, Julia, and Stanley!

1102
01:06:03,856 --> 01:06:08,527
And our new adult challengers
are Mim, Luis, and Todd.

1103
01:06:08,568 --> 01:06:11,239
And me, I'm Dick Jennings ...

1104
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:15,114
and say hello to your favorite
host and my boss ...

1105
01:06:15,155 --> 01:06:18,617
Jimmy Gator!

1106
01:06:24,539 --> 01:06:27,085
Back again, again, again!

1107
01:06:27,126 --> 01:06:28,920
I'm Jimmy Gator,
and believe it or not ...

1108
01:06:28,961 --> 01:06:32,257
we are at the end of week seven,
heading towards week eight ...

1109
01:06:32,297 --> 01:06:36,344
with these three incredible kids
who − hello, hello ...

1110
01:06:36,385 --> 01:06:38,429
are just two days
and two games away ...

1111
01:06:38,471 --> 01:06:40,472
from the
"What Do Kids Know?" record ...

1112
01:06:40,514 --> 01:06:43,934
for the longest-running
quiz show in television history.

1113
01:06:43,976 --> 01:06:46,436
Now, we are
endorsed by the PTA ...

1114
01:06:46,478 --> 01:06:48,940
and the North American
Teacher's Foundation.

1115
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:51,442
We do try to keep
our standards high ...

1116
01:06:51,483 --> 01:06:53,443
and that's why we are
the longest-running quiz show ...

1117
01:06:53,485 --> 01:06:54,778
in television history!

1118
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:56,780
I want to say something
about these kids.

1119
01:06:56,822 --> 01:06:59,449
These kids right here,
they'll be here a while.

1120
01:06:59,492 --> 01:07:02,452
But today's
a dangerous day because ...

1121
01:07:02,494 --> 01:07:05,244
I have just met with the adult
challengers backstage ...

1122
01:07:05,286 --> 01:07:07,414
and let me tell you ...

1123
01:07:07,454 --> 01:07:09,666
they are a terrific challenge
for our kids.

1124
01:07:09,708 --> 01:07:12,585
So let's get this show
up and away, shall we?

1125
01:07:16,965 --> 01:07:19,509
We want to know
where your son is, Marcie.

1126
01:07:19,550 --> 01:07:20,927
Jerome Samuel Hall.

1127
01:07:20,969 --> 01:07:22,929
Did he fight with your husband?
Is this the Worm?

1128
01:07:22,971 --> 01:07:25,306
Maybe they had a fight.
Maybe it was an accident.

1129
01:07:25,306 --> 01:07:26,599
Do they call him Worm?

1130
01:07:26,641 --> 01:07:29,143
We want to know
where your son is, Marcie.

1131
01:07:29,184 --> 01:07:30,811
Do they call him Worm?

1132
01:07:30,853 --> 01:07:32,813
Help us help your son,
Marcie.

1133
01:07:32,856 --> 01:07:34,106
Do they call him Worm?

1134
01:07:34,148 --> 01:07:35,942
Help us help your son,
Marcie.

1135
01:07:35,983 --> 01:07:37,943
Your son and your grandson.
Help us help them.

1136
01:07:37,985 --> 01:07:39,945
Is this the Worm?

1137
01:07:41,822 --> 01:07:43,282
Let's jump right in.

1138
01:07:43,324 --> 01:07:45,492
A quick recap
for those who don't know.

1139
01:07:45,534 --> 01:07:48,954
Round One. Three categories.
Steals are OK.

1140
01:07:48,996 --> 01:07:51,625
Point scale escalating
from 25 to 250 ...

1141
01:07:51,666 --> 01:07:54,085
one of which
is a conversation bonus.

1142
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:04,050
That'll be 31.90.

1143
01:08:04,092 --> 01:08:06,052
The categories are ...

1144
01:08:06,094 --> 01:08:08,387
"Authors,
Chaos versus Superstring ...

1145
01:08:08,429 --> 01:08:10,014
"and Rub-a-Dub."

1146
01:08:13,018 --> 01:08:14,728
Max. Thanks.

1147
01:08:15,938 --> 01:08:17,898
Adults won a coin toss
backstage ...

1148
01:08:17,939 --> 01:08:19,733
so they get to pick first.

1149
01:08:19,774 --> 01:08:21,734
Team captain ...Mim.

1150
01:08:34,288 --> 01:08:35,832
Got it.

1151
01:08:35,873 --> 01:08:37,792
First question for twenty-five.

1152
01:08:37,792 --> 01:08:41,255
This female author's most famous
work − "O Pioneers!"

1153
01:08:45,797 --> 01:08:46,923
Willa Cather.

1154
01:08:46,966 --> 01:08:48,466
Willa Cather for twenty-five.

1155
01:08:48,466 --> 01:08:52,595
Best known for the Tragedy and
Blood genre, this playwright ...

1156
01:08:52,637 --> 01:08:55,474
Thomas Kyd.

1157
01:08:55,515 --> 01:08:59,185
This French playwright and actor
joined the Bejart troupe ...

1158
01:08:59,228 --> 01:09:01,104
MolEire.

1159
01:09:01,145 --> 01:09:03,983
I'm afraid I'm going
to need a full name, Stanley.

1160
01:09:03,983 --> 01:09:06,068
Jean-Batiste Poquelin MolEire.

1161
01:09:07,569 --> 01:09:09,404
What the fuck is this?

1162
01:09:09,445 --> 01:09:11,407
God damn.
My little fucker.

1163
01:09:11,448 --> 01:09:13,908
I have no idea
where he gets this shit.

1164
01:09:13,951 --> 01:09:15,911
He's a fucking genius, really.

1165
01:09:15,953 --> 01:09:18,913
This is Chad.
Can I have your phone number?

1166
01:09:18,956 --> 01:09:20,916
Hello. Great.
This is "Seduce and Destroy"?

1167
01:09:20,957 --> 01:09:24,168
Yes, it is. Can I have
your home phone number?

1168
01:09:24,211 --> 01:09:25,587
I don't want
to order anything.

1169
01:09:25,628 --> 01:09:28,423
I have a situation
that's just come up ...

1170
01:09:28,465 --> 01:09:30,259
that's really pretty serious ...

1171
01:09:30,301 --> 01:09:33,261
and I don't know who to talk to
or what I should do ...

1172
01:09:33,304 --> 01:09:35,261
but maybe you could put me
in touch with somebody ...

1173
01:09:35,302 --> 01:09:37,430
if I explain myself?

1174
01:09:37,470 --> 01:09:39,515
We're really only equipped
to take orders here, sir.

1175
01:09:39,556 --> 01:09:42,935
It's just us with the phones,
and that's what we do.

1176
01:09:42,976 --> 01:09:46,605
Could you connect me with
somebody else, you think?

1177
01:09:46,646 --> 01:09:48,774
What's the situation?

1178
01:09:48,815 --> 01:09:50,775
OK, great.

1179
01:09:50,818 --> 01:09:54,238
Let me try to explain myself
without it seeming crazy.

1180
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:55,573
But here I go.

1181
01:09:55,573 --> 01:09:57,574
My name is Phil Parma ...

1182
01:09:57,617 --> 01:10:00,619
and I work for a man
named Earl Partridge ...

1183
01:10:00,661 --> 01:10:02,622
Mr. Earl Partridge.

1184
01:10:02,662 --> 01:10:05,457
I'm his nurse.
He's a very sick man.

1185
01:10:05,498 --> 01:10:08,461
He's a dying man,
and he's sick ...

1186
01:10:08,502 --> 01:10:11,756
and he's asked me
to help him ....

1187
01:10:11,796 --> 01:10:13,841
to help him find his son.

1188
01:10:16,010 --> 01:10:17,970
Hello? Are you there?

1189
01:10:18,011 --> 01:10:19,596
I'm here. I'm listening.

1190
01:10:19,639 --> 01:10:21,974
OK. You see ...

1191
01:10:22,015 --> 01:10:25,557
Frank T.J. Mackey
is Earl Partridge's son.

1192
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,476
So where are you
from originally?

1193
01:10:27,518 --> 01:10:30,145
- Around here.
- Valley?

1194
01:10:30,188 --> 01:10:33,149
- Hollywood, mainly.
- What did your parents do?

1195
01:10:33,190 --> 01:10:35,068
My father was in television.

1196
01:10:35,109 --> 01:10:37,319
My mother − This is going
to sound silly to you.

1197
01:10:37,362 --> 01:10:39,988
- Try me.
- She was a librarian.

1198
01:10:40,030 --> 01:10:41,658
Why does that sound silly?

1199
01:10:41,698 --> 01:10:43,659
I don't know.
I guess it doesn't.

1200
01:10:43,701 --> 01:10:44,993
Does your mother still work?

1201
01:10:45,036 --> 01:10:46,996
No, she's retired.

1202
01:10:47,037 --> 01:10:48,997
Are you close?

1203
01:10:49,039 --> 01:10:50,875
She's my mother.

1204
01:10:50,917 --> 01:10:53,670
Yes, but she's a woman, too.

1205
01:10:53,711 --> 01:10:56,713
How does she feel about
"Seduce and Destroy"?

1206
01:10:56,713 --> 01:10:58,550
What does she say?

1207
01:11:00,635 --> 01:11:04,180
Well, she says,
"You go get them, honey."

1208
01:11:04,221 --> 01:11:06,474
What about your father?

1209
01:11:06,515 --> 01:11:09,476
My father.
Unfortunately, he passed away.

1210
01:11:09,519 --> 01:11:11,645
I'm sorry.
I had no idea.

1211
01:11:11,688 --> 01:11:13,146
No, please.

1212
01:11:13,189 --> 01:11:15,564
I wouldn't have brought
that up if I had known.

1213
01:11:15,604 --> 01:11:16,981
It's a very hard thing.

1214
01:11:17,023 --> 01:11:18,984
Please.
Yes, it is, but ...listen.

1215
01:11:19,024 --> 01:11:21,987
You have to move forward.
The past has its place.

1216
01:11:22,028 --> 01:11:26,032
It was a long time ago
and people die.

1217
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:30,161
Let's switch gears here.

1218
01:11:30,203 --> 01:11:33,497
According to your book,
you ended up at UC Berkeley?

1219
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:35,500
- '84-'89.
- Psychology major.

1220
01:11:35,542 --> 01:11:37,502
- That's right.
- Get your masters?

1221
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:39,712
This close.

1222
01:11:39,753 --> 01:11:41,840
That's impressive in five years.

1223
01:11:41,881 --> 01:11:44,009
Cap, can I have some coffee?

1224
01:11:44,050 --> 01:11:46,011
Can I get you anything?

1225
01:11:46,051 --> 01:11:47,470
No, I'm good.

1226
01:11:47,511 --> 01:11:49,847
She's good.
I need coffee.

1227
01:11:52,809 --> 01:11:55,228
Cats and dogs out there, huh?

1228
01:11:57,605 --> 01:12:02,068
Must have a lot going on
for all that stuff back there.

1229
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:04,029
You could ...

1230
01:12:04,069 --> 01:12:06,862
You could have quite a party
with all that stuff.

1231
01:12:09,488 --> 01:12:12,951
You been on Prozac long?
Dexedrine?

1232
01:12:12,993 --> 01:12:14,493
I don't ...

1233
01:12:14,493 --> 01:12:16,371
Interesting drugs.

1234
01:12:16,412 --> 01:12:19,457
Dexedrine's basically
speed in a pill, you know?

1235
01:12:19,498 --> 01:12:21,627
But I guess
a lot of the doctors ...

1236
01:12:21,667 --> 01:12:24,796
are balancing out the Prozac
with the Dexedrine.

1237
01:12:24,837 --> 01:12:27,506
That liquid morphine
will knock you down, out ...

1238
01:12:27,506 --> 01:12:30,051
around, up and down,
someone's not careful.

1239
01:12:32,970 --> 01:12:35,349
You can't mix those up.

1240
01:12:53,408 --> 01:12:56,367
Strong stuff here, boy.

1241
01:12:56,408 --> 01:12:59,744
What exactly you have wrong,
you need all this stuff?

1242
01:12:59,744 --> 01:13:02,706
- Mother fucker!
- What?

1243
01:13:02,747 --> 01:13:04,375
What are you talking about?

1244
01:13:04,416 --> 01:13:05,792
You fucking asshole!

1245
01:13:05,833 --> 01:13:07,795
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

1246
01:13:07,836 --> 01:13:09,630
I come in here ...

1247
01:13:09,671 --> 01:13:11,631
you don't know who I am,
what my life is ...

1248
01:13:11,673 --> 01:13:13,466
and you have the balls,
the indecency ...

1249
01:13:13,509 --> 01:13:15,386
to ask me a question
about my life?

1250
01:13:15,426 --> 01:13:17,136
Please, lady,
why don't you just calm down?

1251
01:13:17,179 --> 01:13:18,972
fuck you, too!
Don't you call me lady!

1252
01:13:19,014 --> 01:13:21,559
I come in here,
I give these things to you ...

1253
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,644
you check,
you make your phone calls ...

1254
01:13:23,685 --> 01:13:25,645
look suspicious, ask questions!

1255
01:13:25,688 --> 01:13:27,146
I'm sick!

1256
01:13:27,189 --> 01:13:30,984
I have sickness all around me,
and you ask me my life?

1257
01:13:31,025 --> 01:13:32,319
What's wrong?

1258
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:35,989
Have you seen death in your bed?
In your house?

1259
01:13:36,030 --> 01:13:37,824
Where's your fucking decency?

1260
01:13:37,865 --> 01:13:39,827
And then I'm asked
fucking questions.

1261
01:13:39,868 --> 01:13:42,997
What's ...wrong?!

1262
01:13:43,037 --> 01:13:46,581
You suck my dick!
That's what's wrong!

1263
01:13:46,622 --> 01:13:48,957
And you fucking call me lady?!

1264
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:53,337
Shame on you!

1265
01:13:53,378 --> 01:13:55,672
Shame on both of you!

1266
01:13:57,382 --> 01:13:59,676
So why don't they
have the same last name?

1267
01:13:59,719 --> 01:14:02,012
Because they don't
have the same last name.

1268
01:14:02,054 --> 01:14:05,600
I know, and I can't
really explain that.

1269
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:10,313
But I have a feeling there is
a situation between them ...

1270
01:14:10,354 --> 01:14:12,523
like they don't know
each other much or well.

1271
01:14:12,564 --> 01:14:17,028
Something like they don't
talk much any more, even.

1272
01:14:17,069 --> 01:14:20,072
God, does this sound weird?

1273
01:14:20,072 --> 01:14:22,198
I just don't understand
why you're calling me.

1274
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:26,828
There's no number for Frank
in any of Earl's stuff ...

1275
01:14:26,871 --> 01:14:28,831
and he's pretty out of it.

1276
01:14:28,872 --> 01:14:32,001
Like I said, he's dying ...

1277
01:14:32,042 --> 01:14:34,835
dying of cancer. So ...

1278
01:14:34,877 --> 01:14:38,003
- What kind of cancer?
- Brain and lung.

1279
01:14:38,046 --> 01:14:40,840
- My mother had breast cancer.
- I'm sorry.

1280
01:14:40,881 --> 01:14:44,010
- Is she all right?
- She's fine now.

1281
01:14:44,051 --> 01:14:46,679
- That's good.
- It was scary, though.

1282
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:49,515
- It's a hell of a disease.
- It sure is.

1283
01:14:49,556 --> 01:14:52,601
Wait, I'm sorry.
So why call me?

1284
01:14:52,644 --> 01:14:57,023
I know this sounds silly,
and I might sound ridiculous ...

1285
01:14:57,064 --> 01:14:59,024
like this is the scene
of the movie ...

1286
01:14:59,067 --> 01:15:03,029
where the guy tries to get ahold
of the long-lost son ...

1287
01:15:03,070 --> 01:15:05,948
but this is that scene.

1288
01:15:05,989 --> 01:15:09,118
And I think they have
those scenes in movies ...

1289
01:15:09,159 --> 01:15:10,787
because they're true.

1290
01:15:10,828 --> 01:15:12,829
Because they really happen ...

1291
01:15:12,829 --> 01:15:16,000
and you gotta believe me,
this is really happening.

1292
01:15:17,502 --> 01:15:21,213
I can give you my number
and you can go check with ...

1293
01:15:21,256 --> 01:15:23,800
whoever you gotta check with
and call me back ...

1294
01:15:23,841 --> 01:15:26,341
but do not leave me
hanging on this.

1295
01:15:26,341 --> 01:15:28,051
All right? Please.

1296
01:15:28,092 --> 01:15:31,555
I'm just − Please.

1297
01:15:31,595 --> 01:15:33,765
See ...

1298
01:15:35,766 --> 01:15:39,520
this is the scene of the movie
where you help me out.

1299
01:15:39,563 --> 01:15:43,024
You're great.
These are great questions.

1300
01:15:43,024 --> 01:15:47,112
Good. I thought
you grew up in the Valley.

1301
01:15:47,153 --> 01:15:48,404
Like I said ...around.

1302
01:15:48,445 --> 01:15:50,532
You went to Van Nuys High?

1303
01:15:50,573 --> 01:15:53,033
I wouldn't say I went.
I frequented.

1304
01:15:53,033 --> 01:15:54,243
I was misguided, pathetic.

1305
01:15:54,286 --> 01:15:56,203
Definitely not
the Frank T.J. Mackey ...

1306
01:15:56,246 --> 01:15:58,873
you're so eagerly wanting
to put on national television.

1307
01:15:58,914 --> 01:16:00,876
Because I was swimming
in what was ...

1308
01:16:00,917 --> 01:16:02,377
as opposed to what I wanted.

1309
01:16:02,418 --> 01:16:05,462
- Where does that name come from?
- My name?

1310
01:16:05,505 --> 01:16:07,465
It's not your given name?

1311
01:16:07,506 --> 01:16:09,466
It's my mother's name, actually.

1312
01:16:09,509 --> 01:16:11,469
That's good.
Done your research.

1313
01:16:11,511 --> 01:16:14,305
- And Frank?
- My mother's father.

1314
01:16:14,346 --> 01:16:17,805
That's why.
See, I had some trouble ...

1315
01:16:17,847 --> 01:16:21,018
locating your school records
at UCLA and Berkeley.

1316
01:16:21,059 --> 01:16:23,060
It's your name change ...

1317
01:16:23,103 --> 01:16:24,979
because they had
no official enrollment for you.

1318
01:16:25,021 --> 01:16:27,440
No, they wouldn't.

1319
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:29,984
No. Because I was never
officially enrolled there.

1320
01:16:30,027 --> 01:16:32,487
- Was that unclear?
- Kind of.

1321
01:16:32,529 --> 01:16:35,489
God, I wouldn't want
that to be misunderstood.

1322
01:16:35,532 --> 01:16:38,952
My enrollment
was totally unofficial.

1323
01:16:38,952 --> 01:16:40,953
Sadly, I couldn't afford
to pay the tuition up there.

1324
01:16:40,996 --> 01:16:42,663
But there were
three wonderful professors ...

1325
01:16:42,706 --> 01:16:44,582
kind enough to let me
to sit in their classes.

1326
01:16:44,625 --> 01:16:47,127
Macready, Horn, and Langtree,
among others.

1327
01:16:47,168 --> 01:16:49,171
You're welcome
to call them if you like.

1328
01:16:49,212 --> 01:16:51,131
I didn't get a free ride.

1329
01:16:51,172 --> 01:16:54,801
So what we're looking at here
is a true rags-to-riches story.

1330
01:16:54,842 --> 01:16:57,511
That's why people respond
so strongly to "Seduce."

1331
01:16:57,554 --> 01:16:59,514
Because at the end of the day ...

1332
01:16:59,555 --> 01:17:02,016
"Seduce" may not be just
about picking up chicks ...

1333
01:17:02,059 --> 01:17:03,851
and sticking your cock in.

1334
01:17:03,894 --> 01:17:06,976
It's about finding out
what you can be in this world ...

1335
01:17:07,019 --> 01:17:09,479
defining it,
controlling it, and saying ...

1336
01:17:09,521 --> 01:17:12,190
"I will take what is mine."

1337
01:17:12,233 --> 01:17:15,360
And you just happen to get
a little blow job out of it ...

1338
01:17:15,402 --> 01:17:17,320
then, hey, what the fuck?

1339
01:17:17,363 --> 01:17:18,572
There you go.

1340
01:17:18,613 --> 01:17:21,492
End of Round One.
Excellent work.

1341
01:17:21,533 --> 01:17:25,496
I think we should take
a look at the scores here.

1342
01:17:25,537 --> 01:17:27,497
Kids are up a leg with 1,500 ...

1343
01:17:27,539 --> 01:17:30,501
and the adults are down
a little bit with 1,025.

1344
01:17:30,542 --> 01:17:34,087
So we'll be back for Round Two
in a ring-dang-doo!

1345
01:17:34,128 --> 01:17:37,882
Hello, hello!
Bonus musical question.

1346
01:17:37,925 --> 01:17:39,885
And the winner is ...

1347
01:17:43,721 --> 01:17:44,974
Kids!

1348
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:49,019
Kids are in the lead.

1349
01:17:49,060 --> 01:17:51,855
They get a chance to pull
further and farther ahead ...

1350
01:17:51,896 --> 01:17:56,023
if they answer the following
secret bonus musical question.

1351
01:17:56,064 --> 01:17:59,527
Now what I'm going to do
is read a line from an opera.

1352
01:17:59,569 --> 01:18:01,529
I want you to give me
that line back ...

1353
01:18:01,570 --> 01:18:04,030
in the language in which the
opera was originally written.

1354
01:18:04,073 --> 01:18:08,452
And for a bonus 250 − 250 ...

1355
01:18:08,493 --> 01:18:10,872
you can sing it!

1356
01:18:10,912 --> 01:18:13,457
Here's the line.

1357
01:18:13,498 --> 01:18:17,795
"Love is a rebellious bird
that nobody can tame.

1358
01:18:17,837 --> 01:18:20,797
"And it's all in vain
to call it ...

1359
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:22,300
"if it chooses to refuse."

1360
01:18:24,342 --> 01:18:26,970
Well, that was in French ...

1361
01:18:27,012 --> 01:18:29,390
and that was from
the opera "Carmen ..."

1362
01:18:29,431 --> 01:18:31,809
and that goes ...

1363
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:34,979
L'amour est
un oiseau rebelle

1364
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:38,815
Que nul ne peut apprivoiser

1365
01:18:38,858 --> 01:18:42,485
Et c'est bien en vain
qu'on I'appelle

1366
01:18:42,528 --> 01:18:46,279
S'il lui convient de refuser

1367
01:18:52,034 --> 01:18:54,537
See you got
some coffee brewing here.

1368
01:18:54,537 --> 01:18:57,539
Yeah, it's not −
It's been on for a bit.

1369
01:18:57,539 --> 01:18:59,667
I like iced coffee, generally ...

1370
01:18:59,708 --> 01:19:03,587
but a day like today,
with the rain and whatnot ...

1371
01:19:03,630 --> 01:19:05,672
I enjoy a warm cup.

1372
01:19:11,595 --> 01:19:13,680
Do you want a cup?

1373
01:19:13,722 --> 01:19:15,641
Is that all right?

1374
01:19:15,682 --> 01:19:17,644
It's raining
cats and dogs out there.

1375
01:19:17,685 --> 01:19:20,688
I'd just as soon
not go back in it.

1376
01:19:20,771 --> 01:19:24,609
I don't know how fresh
it's going to be.

1377
01:19:24,650 --> 01:19:26,903
I'm sure it's fine, Claudia.

1378
01:19:30,532 --> 01:19:33,993
Do you take cream or sugar?

1379
01:19:34,034 --> 01:19:35,992
That'd be fine.

1380
01:19:36,033 --> 01:19:38,328
So, Claudia,
let me just say ...

1381
01:19:38,369 --> 01:19:40,997
so I can get my role
as an LAPD officer ...

1382
01:19:41,038 --> 01:19:43,667
out of the way here
be fore we enjoy our coffee.

1383
01:19:43,707 --> 01:19:46,127
I don't like to talk shop
over coffee.

1384
01:19:46,168 --> 01:19:48,380
I'm not going to write you up.

1385
01:19:48,421 --> 01:19:50,840
I'm not going to give you
a citation here ...

1386
01:19:50,881 --> 01:19:54,844
but the real problem is that
you got people around you ...

1387
01:19:54,886 --> 01:19:58,640
people who work from home,
trying to get work done.

1388
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:00,850
And if you're listening
to your music that loud ...

1389
01:20:00,891 --> 01:20:04,020
they're inconvenienced by that.

1390
01:20:04,061 --> 01:20:08,024
If you had a job,
you'd probably understand ...

1391
01:20:08,065 --> 01:20:10,527
but you like listening
to your music.

1392
01:20:10,569 --> 01:20:13,029
That's fine.

1393
01:20:13,070 --> 01:20:17,408
Just want to keep an eye
on the volume level.

1394
01:20:17,449 --> 01:20:21,162
Maybe memorize what number
you see on the dial.

1395
01:20:21,203 --> 01:20:23,747
If it's the middle of the day,
that's what I do.

1396
01:20:23,789 --> 01:20:25,706
I just set it
at two and a half ...

1397
01:20:25,747 --> 01:20:28,708
and then I know that's
a good listening level for me.

1398
01:20:28,750 --> 01:20:32,087
But you like listening
to your music loud.

1399
01:20:33,087 --> 01:20:34,881
That's fine.
That's cool.

1400
01:20:34,922 --> 01:20:37,009
It's good to rock out sometimes.

1401
01:20:37,050 --> 01:20:39,011
But you can't do it every day ...

1402
01:20:39,051 --> 01:20:42,014
or else you risk damaging
your ears. Seriously.

1403
01:20:45,725 --> 01:20:49,061
You listen to it
all the time like that?

1404
01:20:49,104 --> 01:20:51,230
You're going to drive
these people crazy.

1405
01:20:51,273 --> 01:20:54,443
Anyway, you get the point.

1406
01:20:58,279 --> 01:20:59,780
Cheers.

1407
01:21:09,457 --> 01:21:11,542
So this boyfriend bothering you?

1408
01:21:11,585 --> 01:21:13,545
I don't have a boyfriend.

1409
01:21:13,587 --> 01:21:15,543
The gentleman
who was at the door ...

1410
01:21:15,586 --> 01:21:17,337
He's not my boyfriend.

1411
01:21:20,256 --> 01:21:23,719
A lot of times,
in domestic abuse situations ...

1412
01:21:23,761 --> 01:21:26,387
the young woman
is afraid to speak out.

1413
01:21:26,430 --> 01:21:30,225
You don't have to be afraid
to tell me anything.

1414
01:21:30,266 --> 01:21:33,229
And as a police officer,
I can tell you ...

1415
01:21:33,270 --> 01:21:36,064
it goes bad places.

1416
01:21:36,105 --> 01:21:38,067
Young woman's
afraid to speak out ...

1417
01:21:38,108 --> 01:21:40,569
next thing you know,
I'm here on a 187.

1418
01:21:40,610 --> 01:21:42,988
What's a 187?

1419
01:21:43,029 --> 01:21:44,907
It's not good.

1420
01:21:44,948 --> 01:21:48,077
And it's where situations
like this always lead.

1421
01:21:48,118 --> 01:21:50,328
It's not my boyfriend,
and it's not anything.

1422
01:21:50,371 --> 01:21:53,748
It's over. Really.
He won't come back.

1423
01:21:53,791 --> 01:21:55,708
I don't want to have
to come back here ...

1424
01:21:55,751 --> 01:21:57,086
You won't have to!

1425
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:03,591
I wouldn't mind coming back.

1426
01:22:03,634 --> 01:22:07,009
You know, get a look
at your pretty face again.

1427
01:22:07,051 --> 01:22:08,301
I'll be right back.

1428
01:22:15,225 --> 01:22:18,563
Here you go.
Let's get the jacket off.

1429
01:22:18,604 --> 01:22:20,564
It'll help you to breathe.

1430
01:22:22,233 --> 01:22:23,900
I can't fucking do this.

1431
01:22:27,654 --> 01:22:30,283
I've − I ...

1432
01:22:30,323 --> 01:22:33,828
I think I'm gonna throw up.
I think.

1433
01:22:36,247 --> 01:22:40,292
I haven't thrown up
since I was twenty years old.

1434
01:22:45,131 --> 01:22:47,550
- What's the problem?
- I need to go to the bathroom.

1435
01:22:47,591 --> 01:22:50,051
Jesus Christ, Stanley.
You can't go now.

1436
01:22:50,136 --> 01:22:52,762
You have exactly one minute
before we're on the air.

1437
01:22:52,805 --> 01:22:54,599
Now is not the time
to go to the bathroom!

1438
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:57,640
Why does this fucking
shit always happen, Stanley?

1439
01:22:57,681 --> 01:22:58,975
Excuse me, is there a problem?

1440
01:22:59,016 --> 01:23:00,601
Mind your own business!

1441
01:23:00,643 --> 01:23:02,604
You watch your mouth, young man!

1442
01:23:02,645 --> 01:23:04,771
Why don't you mind
your own business?

1443
01:23:04,814 --> 01:23:06,149
Oh, no, she didn't!

1444
01:23:06,149 --> 01:23:10,612
Wait for the commercial break,
then you can go.

1445
01:23:10,653 --> 01:23:12,654
Just hold it.

1446
01:23:12,654 --> 01:23:15,658
Don't taunt the kids.

1447
01:23:15,699 --> 01:23:18,493
- I'm trying to be helpful.
- Don't start trouble.

1448
01:23:18,493 --> 01:23:21,497
You haven't seen trouble!
Wait till next commercial break.

1449
01:23:21,538 --> 01:23:24,082
- What's the problem?
- Nothing.

1450
01:23:24,125 --> 01:23:26,711
Lily! Please!

1451
01:23:26,752 --> 01:23:28,796
Get away from me, you shithead!

1452
01:23:35,094 --> 01:23:36,845
Watch out, watch out.

1453
01:23:51,065 --> 01:23:52,274
Don't eat these.

1454
01:24:00,992 --> 01:24:02,743
Here you go.

1455
01:24:14,756 --> 01:24:17,425
Out of the trash!

1456
01:24:19,094 --> 01:24:22,389
Phil, are you there?
It's Chad.

1457
01:24:22,430 --> 01:24:25,891
I'm going to put you in touch
with Janet, Frank's assistant.

1458
01:24:25,934 --> 01:24:28,060
And she'll see what she can do,
all right?

1459
01:24:28,103 --> 01:24:31,398
Thank you, and good luck
to you and your mother.

1460
01:24:31,439 --> 01:24:34,400
Thanks, man. You, too.
Janet, are you there?

1461
01:24:34,442 --> 01:24:36,649
All right, Janet,
you have Phil Parma.

1462
01:24:43,114 --> 01:24:48,369
I have cancer, Mary.
I have about two months.

1463
01:24:48,412 --> 01:24:51,247
I have no time.
It's in my bones.

1464
01:24:51,289 --> 01:24:53,917
I don't have a chance.

1465
01:24:53,958 --> 01:24:55,168
I'm fucked.

1466
01:25:00,173 --> 01:25:02,842
And fifteen seconds.

1467
01:25:06,220 --> 01:25:07,972
Ten seconds.

1468
01:25:10,434 --> 01:25:15,898
And five, four, three, two ...

1469
01:25:15,898 --> 01:25:18,192
We're back,
ready for Round Two!

1470
01:25:18,274 --> 01:25:21,485
And we're talking to our
adult contestants here today.

1471
01:25:21,528 --> 01:25:23,988
Mim, it says here that you live
in Chatsworth, California ...

1472
01:25:24,030 --> 01:25:25,195
and that you have two kids.

1473
01:25:25,237 --> 01:25:27,030
That's right.
I have a six-year-old ...

1474
01:25:27,072 --> 01:25:29,492
Do you know who I am?

1475
01:25:29,533 --> 01:25:32,161
You're a friend of the family,
I presume.

1476
01:25:32,203 --> 01:25:34,078
What does that mean?

1477
01:25:34,078 --> 01:25:37,082
Nothing special.
Just a spoke in the wheel.

1478
01:25:37,082 --> 01:25:41,420
You talk in rhymes
and riddles and Rub-a-Dub.

1479
01:25:41,462 --> 01:25:43,546
But that doesn't mean
anything to me.

1480
01:25:43,588 --> 01:25:45,591
See, I used to be smart.

1481
01:25:45,632 --> 01:25:47,592
I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith.

1482
01:25:49,761 --> 01:25:52,597
I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith
from TV.

1483
01:25:52,597 --> 01:25:54,600
It might have been
before my time.

1484
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:58,061
I remember.
In the Sixties, right?

1485
01:25:58,145 --> 01:26:00,939
- I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith.
- Like you said.

1486
01:26:00,980 --> 01:26:02,942
Smart kid!

1487
01:26:02,983 --> 01:26:05,069
You got struck
by lightning once.

1488
01:26:05,109 --> 01:26:06,153
So what?

1489
01:26:06,194 --> 01:26:08,948
- I heard about that.
- Did it hurt?

1490
01:26:10,573 --> 01:26:13,618
But you're all right now.
So what's the what?

1491
01:26:13,661 --> 01:26:15,868
- What?
- That's right.

1492
01:26:15,909 --> 01:26:20,706
I used to be smart.
Now I'm just stupid.

1493
01:26:20,747 --> 01:26:23,417
Brad, dear,
who was it that said ...

1494
01:26:23,458 --> 01:26:27,421
"A man of genius has seldom
been ruined but by himself"?

1495
01:26:29,756 --> 01:26:32,801
It was
the lovely Samuel Johnson.

1496
01:26:32,844 --> 01:26:35,887
Who also spoke of a fellow
"who was not only dull ...

1497
01:26:35,930 --> 01:26:38,306
"but a cause of dullness
in others"?

1498
01:26:38,349 --> 01:26:39,934
"The cause of dullness
in others."

1499
01:26:39,975 --> 01:26:41,101
Picky, picky!

1500
01:26:41,143 --> 01:26:42,979
Let me tell you this.

1501
01:26:43,020 --> 01:26:45,898
Samuel Johnson never
had his life shit on ...

1502
01:26:45,939 --> 01:26:49,234
and taken from him
and his money stolen!

1503
01:26:49,277 --> 01:26:51,570
Who took his life and his money?

1504
01:26:51,612 --> 01:26:55,323
His parents?
His mommy and daddy?

1505
01:26:55,365 --> 01:26:58,161
Make him live this life
like this ...

1506
01:26:58,202 --> 01:27:02,414
A man of genius who gets
shit on as a child ...

1507
01:27:02,456 --> 01:27:05,247
and that scars! That hurts!

1508
01:27:05,289 --> 01:27:07,457
Have you ever been
hit by lightning?

1509
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:11,421
It hurts.
It doesn't happen to everyone.

1510
01:27:11,462 --> 01:27:13,046
It's an electrical charge.

1511
01:27:13,088 --> 01:27:15,216
It finds its way
across the universe ...

1512
01:27:15,257 --> 01:27:19,970
and it lands in your body
and your head!

1513
01:27:20,012 --> 01:27:25,225
And as for ruined
but by himself ...

1514
01:27:25,268 --> 01:27:28,188
not if his parents
took his freaking life ...

1515
01:27:28,229 --> 01:27:30,648
and his money
and tell you to do this ...

1516
01:27:30,689 --> 01:27:33,568
and to do that,
and if you don't ...

1517
01:27:33,609 --> 01:27:36,570
Your parents took your money
you won on that game show?

1518
01:27:36,613 --> 01:27:39,407
Yes! They did.

1519
01:27:42,534 --> 01:27:45,997
What does that mean,
a spoke in the wheel?

1520
01:27:45,997 --> 01:27:48,750
Things go round and round,
don't they?

1521
01:27:48,791 --> 01:27:51,920
Yes, they do. They do.

1522
01:27:51,961 --> 01:27:54,961
But I'll make my dreams
come true.

1523
01:27:55,002 --> 01:27:58,297
Sounds sad as a weeping willow.

1524
01:27:58,340 --> 01:28:00,341
I used to be smart.

1525
01:28:00,382 --> 01:28:03,052
But now I'm just stupid.

1526
01:28:04,804 --> 01:28:06,680
Shall we drink to that?

1527
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:10,018
I want to talk a little bit more
about your background.

1528
01:28:10,060 --> 01:28:12,520
You made
some references earlier ...

1529
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:17,609
to subjective human experiences
and terrible things ...

1530
01:28:17,650 --> 01:28:21,154
Actually,
I'm confused about your past.

1531
01:28:21,195 --> 01:28:23,864
Is that still lingering?

1532
01:28:23,907 --> 01:28:25,283
It's so boring.

1533
01:28:25,324 --> 01:28:27,077
Just want to clear
some things up.

1534
01:28:27,118 --> 01:28:29,954
Excuse me.
Thank you, Muff.

1535
01:28:29,996 --> 01:28:32,039
It's a funny thing that ...

1536
01:28:32,082 --> 01:28:34,501
This is an important element
of "Seduce and Destroy ..."

1537
01:28:34,542 --> 01:28:38,046
facing the past is an important
way of not making progress.

1538
01:28:38,087 --> 01:28:41,091
This is something I tell my men
over and over and over.

1539
01:28:41,091 --> 01:28:42,591
This isn't meant ...

1540
01:28:42,591 --> 01:28:45,091
I try to teach
my students to ask ...

1541
01:28:45,091 --> 01:28:47,094
"What is it in aid of?"

1542
01:28:47,094 --> 01:28:50,221
Are you asking me that?

1543
01:28:50,264 --> 01:28:52,306
Well, in trying to
figure out who you are ...

1544
01:28:52,349 --> 01:28:54,059
In aid of what?

1545
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:57,563
Frank, I'm saying that
in trying to figure out ...

1546
01:28:57,604 --> 01:29:02,024
I have more important things
to put myself into.

1547
01:29:02,067 --> 01:29:03,902
I think this is
something important ...

1548
01:29:03,944 --> 01:29:06,822
you might need to think about
putting yourself into.

1549
01:29:06,863 --> 01:29:07,989
Not really.

1550
01:29:08,030 --> 01:29:11,868
It's not like I'm trying
to attack you here.

1551
01:29:11,909 --> 01:29:15,622
This is how you want to spend
your time, go, go, go.

1552
01:29:15,622 --> 01:29:17,748
But you'll be surprised
at what a waste it is.

1553
01:29:17,832 --> 01:29:20,127
The most useless thing
in the world ...

1554
01:29:20,127 --> 01:29:22,421
is that which is behind me.
Chapter Three.

1555
01:29:23,671 --> 01:29:25,841
We talked earlier
about your mother ...

1556
01:29:25,882 --> 01:29:28,385
and about
your father and his death.

1557
01:29:28,426 --> 01:29:32,305
I don't want to be challenging,
but I have to ask.

1558
01:29:32,346 --> 01:29:38,809
I just want to clarify
something that I understand ...

1559
01:29:38,850 --> 01:29:41,854
I'm not sure
I hear a question in here.

1560
01:29:41,854 --> 01:29:44,856
I'm trying to put this
as delicately as I can.

1561
01:29:44,899 --> 01:29:46,900
What's the question?

1562
01:29:46,942 --> 01:29:48,735
Do you remember Miss Simms?

1563
01:29:48,777 --> 01:29:51,572
I know a lot of women.
I'm sure she remembers me.

1564
01:29:51,613 --> 01:29:54,824
From when you were a boy.
She lived in Tarzana.

1565
01:29:54,867 --> 01:29:57,411
That's my old stomping ground.

1566
01:29:59,829 --> 01:30:04,417
Is this the attack portion
of the interview?

1567
01:30:04,460 --> 01:30:06,462
Is the girl coming in
for the kill?

1568
01:30:06,503 --> 01:30:08,588
No. This is about
getting something right ...

1569
01:30:08,631 --> 01:30:11,591
and clarifying your answers
to an earlier question.

1570
01:30:11,634 --> 01:30:12,926
What question?

1571
01:30:12,967 --> 01:30:15,762
I was told that
your mother died, Frank.

1572
01:30:23,813 --> 01:30:25,853
That's what you heard.

1573
01:30:27,939 --> 01:30:30,065
Do you remember Miss Simms?

1574
01:30:36,322 --> 01:30:39,951
I talked to Miss Simms,
your neighbor and caretaker ...

1575
01:30:39,992 --> 01:30:43,453
after your mother died in 1980.

1576
01:30:43,496 --> 01:30:46,957
And in my research ...

1577
01:30:46,998 --> 01:30:52,671
I have you as the only son
of Earl and Lily Partridge.

1578
01:30:52,712 --> 01:30:54,798
And what I learned
from Barbara Simms ...

1579
01:30:54,841 --> 01:31:00,720
is that your mother, Lily,
died in 1980.

1580
01:31:00,762 --> 01:31:04,350
So, it's my understanding
that information supplied ...

1581
01:31:04,391 --> 01:31:07,520
by you and your company
and the answers ...

1582
01:31:07,561 --> 01:31:09,896
to the questions I've asked
is incorrect, Frank.

1583
01:31:09,939 --> 01:31:12,274
And if I want to get
to the bottom ...

1584
01:31:12,315 --> 01:31:14,359
of who you are
and why you are ...

1585
01:31:14,402 --> 01:31:16,609
then I think that
your family history ...

1586
01:31:16,650 --> 01:31:19,863
your actual family history ...

1587
01:31:19,904 --> 01:31:24,993
Well, this is important.

1588
01:31:26,911 --> 01:31:29,788
What is your fucking question?

1589
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:36,962
Well, I guess
my question's this ...

1590
01:31:37,005 --> 01:31:40,175
Why would you lie, Frank?

1591
01:31:41,592 --> 01:31:45,054
Kids ...adults ...

1592
01:31:45,095 --> 01:31:48,307
I would like you
to put yourself at a picnic.

1593
01:31:48,349 --> 01:31:51,603
Place yourself there with
your family and friends ...

1594
01:31:51,644 --> 01:31:53,188
if you'd like.

1595
01:31:53,229 --> 01:31:56,190
You'll hear three musical notes,
and you are to tell me ...

1596
01:31:56,231 --> 01:32:00,153
what it might represent
that you would find at a picnic.

1597
01:32:00,194 --> 01:32:02,113
The first three notes.
Guys.

1598
01:32:07,782 --> 01:32:08,908
Yes, Todd.

1599
01:32:08,949 --> 01:32:10,577
Well, Jimmy, I know this.

1600
01:32:10,618 --> 01:32:14,079
I have perfect pitch,
and that would be A-D-E ...

1601
01:32:14,122 --> 01:32:16,123
and that would represent
lemonade.

1602
01:32:16,123 --> 01:32:18,710
For 250.
Next notes, please.

1603
01:32:23,965 --> 01:32:28,011
Got it. That's E-G-G,
which would be egg.

1604
01:32:28,052 --> 01:32:31,597
For 500. And the third
set of notes. Guys?

1605
01:32:36,094 --> 01:32:37,720
You don't want any water?

1606
01:32:37,761 --> 01:32:39,639
No. I just ...

1607
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:41,682
I'm so fucked up
right now, Alan.

1608
01:32:41,724 --> 01:32:43,643
There's just so much,
so many things.

1609
01:32:43,685 --> 01:32:45,478
Are you on drugs right now?

1610
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:49,481
If I tell you something,
you're a lawyer, right?

1611
01:32:49,524 --> 01:32:51,484
You can't say anything,
tell anybody.

1612
01:32:51,525 --> 01:32:53,319
It's like a privilege.
Attorney/Client.

1613
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:55,318
- You understand?
- Not exactly.

1614
01:32:55,359 --> 01:32:56,485
Like a shrink.

1615
01:32:56,528 --> 01:32:58,488
If I go see a shrink,
I'm protected.

1616
01:32:58,529 --> 01:33:00,489
I can say things − Fuck!

1617
01:33:00,532 --> 01:33:02,367
I don't know what I'm doing.

1618
01:33:02,408 --> 01:33:05,286
Linda, you're safe.
It's all right.

1619
01:33:05,328 --> 01:33:08,456
You're my friend.
You and Earl are clients.

1620
01:33:08,497 --> 01:33:10,457
Whatever you want to say
won't leave this room.

1621
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:12,961
You have something
you want to say to me?

1622
01:33:15,296 --> 01:33:19,134
I have to tell you something.
I have something to tell you.

1623
01:33:19,175 --> 01:33:21,136
I want to change his will.

1624
01:33:21,176 --> 01:33:23,137
Can I change his will?
I need to.

1625
01:33:23,220 --> 01:33:27,100
No, you can't change his will.
Only Earl can.

1626
01:33:27,141 --> 01:33:30,979
No, you see, I never loved him.

1627
01:33:31,020 --> 01:33:33,023
I never loved him. Earl.

1628
01:33:33,064 --> 01:33:37,319
When I met him, I fucked him,
and I married him ...

1629
01:33:37,359 --> 01:33:39,863
because I wanted his money.
You understand?

1630
01:33:39,904 --> 01:33:41,655
I'm telling you this ...

1631
01:33:41,698 --> 01:33:43,992
I've never told anyone,
I didn't love him ...

1632
01:33:44,033 --> 01:33:47,492
but now,
I know I'm in that will.

1633
01:33:47,533 --> 01:33:49,453
We made that fucking thing,
and all the money I'll get.

1634
01:33:49,493 --> 01:33:51,412
I don't want it,
because I love him so much now.

1635
01:33:51,412 --> 01:33:54,957
I've fallen in love with him
now for real as he's dying.

1636
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,085
I look at him,
and he's about to go, Alan.

1637
01:33:57,127 --> 01:33:58,502
He's moments ...

1638
01:33:58,545 --> 01:34:01,922
I took care of him through this.
What now, then?

1639
01:34:01,965 --> 01:34:03,216
Let's listen.

1640
01:34:03,257 --> 01:34:06,011
Hello, Mary.
How are you and the seven kids?

1641
01:34:06,052 --> 01:34:07,887
As you probably heard by now ...

1642
01:34:07,929 --> 01:34:09,847
we sure gave that Pope
a run for his money.

1643
01:34:11,850 --> 01:34:14,226
That would be Robert E. Lee.

1644
01:34:14,269 --> 01:34:18,230
His wife was Mary Parke Custis.
I know he had seven children.

1645
01:34:18,314 --> 01:34:21,150
And he would be
talking about Pope ...

1646
01:34:21,193 --> 01:34:23,194
who he defeated
at the Battle of Manassas.

1647
01:34:23,235 --> 01:34:26,405
Absolutely right, Miss Mim.
Next question.

1648
01:34:26,448 --> 01:34:29,451
Come on.
Snap out of it, man.

1649
01:34:29,493 --> 01:34:31,286
Come on, Stanley.

1650
01:34:33,497 --> 01:34:34,747
Bonjour, Josephine.

1651
01:34:34,787 --> 01:34:37,872
Maintenant
je suis en Egypte.

1652
01:34:37,914 --> 01:34:39,041
Yes, Mim.

1653
01:34:39,082 --> 01:34:41,793
That would be Napoleon
speaking to Josephine.

1654
01:34:41,835 --> 01:34:45,338
Absolutely right, for 500.
Next voice.

1655
01:34:45,381 --> 01:34:47,716
I don't want him to die.

1656
01:34:47,757 --> 01:34:50,051
I didn't love him when we met ...

1657
01:34:50,094 --> 01:34:53,012
and I did so many bad things
to him that he doesn't know.

1658
01:34:53,012 --> 01:34:54,555
Things that
I want to confess to him ...

1659
01:34:54,597 --> 01:34:57,518
But now I do. I love him.

1660
01:34:57,559 --> 01:35:00,436
Linda, what kind of
medication are you on?

1661
01:35:00,479 --> 01:35:02,564
This isn't any fucking
medication talking!

1662
01:35:02,605 --> 01:35:05,775
Can you give me nothing?
You have power of attorney.

1663
01:35:05,818 --> 01:35:09,238
Can you go in the final moments
and change the will?

1664
01:35:09,279 --> 01:35:11,364
I don't want any money.

1665
01:35:11,407 --> 01:35:15,202
I couldn't live with myself
with this thing that I've done.

1666
01:35:15,243 --> 01:35:18,454
I fucked around.
I fucking cheated on him.

1667
01:35:18,497 --> 01:35:21,125
There.
You're his lawyer, our lawyer.

1668
01:35:21,166 --> 01:35:23,877
I am his wife. I broke
the contract of marriage.

1669
01:35:23,918 --> 01:35:25,835
I fucked around on him
many times.

1670
01:35:25,876 --> 01:35:28,045
I sucked other men's cocks.

1671
01:35:28,087 --> 01:35:30,006
Adultery is not
against the law.

1672
01:35:30,046 --> 01:35:33,091
You can't use it in court
to discredit the will.

1673
01:35:33,134 --> 01:35:35,511
- Linda, calm down.
- I can't.

1674
01:35:35,552 --> 01:35:37,680
You don't have
to change the will.

1675
01:35:37,721 --> 01:35:41,182
If you want nothing, renounce
the will when the time comes.

1676
01:35:41,225 --> 01:35:43,226
What does that mean?
Where does the money go?

1677
01:35:43,269 --> 01:35:45,061
It goes to the nearest relative.

1678
01:35:45,104 --> 01:35:48,231
What's that?
That's Frank?

1679
01:35:48,274 --> 01:35:50,734
No. That can't happen.

1680
01:35:50,775 --> 01:35:52,069
Earl doesn't want him
to have anything.

1681
01:35:52,110 --> 01:35:53,404
That's what will happen.

1682
01:35:53,445 --> 01:35:55,197
This is so fucked up
I can hardly stand it.

1683
01:35:55,238 --> 01:35:56,364
Linda, stop!

1684
01:35:56,407 --> 01:35:59,784
Now, you take a moment,
you breathe ...

1685
01:35:59,827 --> 01:36:01,787
and one thing at a time.

1686
01:36:01,828 --> 01:36:04,332
- Shut the fuck up.
- Want me to help you?

1687
01:36:04,372 --> 01:36:06,833
- Shut the fuck up!
- You need to sober up.

1688
01:36:06,876 --> 01:36:09,337
Now, you must really
shut the fuck up.

1689
01:36:09,337 --> 01:36:10,921
Please, shut the fuck up.

1690
01:36:10,962 --> 01:36:13,173
I have to go.

1691
01:36:13,215 --> 01:36:16,423
- Let me call you a car.
- Shut the fuck up!

1692
01:36:16,466 --> 01:36:20,595
Now, imagine that you
are attending a jam session ...

1693
01:36:20,636 --> 01:36:23,055
of classical composers ...

1694
01:36:23,096 --> 01:36:24,681
and they have each done
an arrangement ...

1695
01:36:24,724 --> 01:36:27,560
of the classic favorite
"Whispering."

1696
01:36:27,601 --> 01:36:30,938
Now, we have here
the New World Harmonica Trio ...

1697
01:36:30,979 --> 01:36:33,983
who are going to play ...

1698
01:36:34,024 --> 01:36:38,695
three variations on the theme ...

1699
01:36:38,738 --> 01:36:42,867
as three classical composers
might have written it.

1700
01:36:42,867 --> 01:36:46,578
So you are to name
the first composer.

1701
01:36:46,621 --> 01:36:47,829
Guys.

1702
01:37:00,885 --> 01:37:02,011
Yes, Todd.

1703
01:37:02,052 --> 01:37:03,720
That sounded like Brahms.

1704
01:37:03,762 --> 01:37:06,470
A bit like his
"Hungarian Dance Number Six."

1705
01:37:06,512 --> 01:37:09,849
That is excellent, Todd.
Next composer, guys.

1706
01:37:37,085 --> 01:37:38,420
Stanley the man.

1707
01:37:39,587 --> 01:37:42,172
I don't know the answer.

1708
01:37:42,215 --> 01:37:45,301
That is not right.

1709
01:37:45,342 --> 01:37:47,136
That's not right, Stanley.

1710
01:37:47,177 --> 01:37:50,265
The correct answer is Ravel.

1711
01:37:51,557 --> 01:37:52,850
Ravel.

1712
01:37:54,185 --> 01:37:59,895
And now I'm gonna
have our three whistlers ...

1713
01:37:59,938 --> 01:38:03,899
please to present
the next musical ...

1714
01:38:03,942 --> 01:38:07,194
There were three
musical sections here ...

1715
01:38:07,237 --> 01:38:11,033
and this'll be the third section
that the whistlers ...

1716
01:38:11,033 --> 01:38:14,744
and they'll
play a piece that's ...

1717
01:38:14,786 --> 01:38:18,164
It's very recognizable.
Chopin, actually.

1718
01:38:18,206 --> 01:38:23,920
And it's in the style
of "Marche Militaire."

1719
01:38:23,962 --> 01:38:26,965
It's a very recognizable piece.

1720
01:38:27,006 --> 01:38:30,510
So if you please
just listen to this ...

1721
01:38:30,594 --> 01:38:34,805
and I'm sure
you can identify the ...

1722
01:38:34,847 --> 01:38:36,891
I'm sort of giving away
the answer here.

1723
01:38:36,932 --> 01:38:39,935
It's Chopin. I don't mean
to give away the answer.

1724
01:38:39,935 --> 01:38:42,980
It's just − please just ...

1725
01:38:43,023 --> 01:38:46,564
Well, sing us a ditty, guys.
A Chopin ditty.

1726
01:38:46,606 --> 01:38:50,109
Let's have a Chopin ditty here.
I can't ...

1727
01:38:52,154 --> 01:38:54,030
Go to the fucking card.

1728
01:38:54,073 --> 01:38:55,573
Go to the card. Go.

1729
01:38:55,615 --> 01:38:57,743
Go to the card.

1730
01:39:05,417 --> 01:39:06,627
I'm back.

1731
01:39:06,668 --> 01:39:09,296
For not a fresh cup,
this is a good cup of coffee.

1732
01:39:09,337 --> 01:39:12,341
Thank you.
What do you want to talk about?

1733
01:39:14,801 --> 01:39:17,470
I don't know.

1734
01:39:17,512 --> 01:39:18,721
Do you want to talk?

1735
01:39:20,682 --> 01:39:23,769
What's your name?

1736
01:39:23,810 --> 01:39:25,395
Jim Kurring.

1737
01:39:25,436 --> 01:39:28,606
- Call 911.
- I think I had a stroke.

1738
01:39:28,649 --> 01:39:30,734
No, no, no.
I'm fine. I'm all right.

1739
01:39:30,775 --> 01:39:32,903
I just want
to finish the show.

1740
01:39:32,944 --> 01:39:35,569
No, we need
to call an ambulance.

1741
01:39:35,610 --> 01:39:37,570
Get your fucking hands
off me!

1742
01:39:37,613 --> 01:39:39,323
Let this guy help you.

1743
01:39:39,364 --> 01:39:40,992
I'll tell you what happened.

1744
01:39:41,033 --> 01:39:42,868
Call 911.
Do it right now, Mary.

1745
01:39:42,868 --> 01:39:44,703
I fell down. I couldn't see
for a minute, but I'm OK.

1746
01:39:44,703 --> 01:39:45,954
Get your hands off me!

1747
01:39:55,046 --> 01:39:57,341
- Did you piss your pants?!
- Shut up!

1748
01:39:57,382 --> 01:39:59,719
- What's going on?
- Nothing! Go away!

1749
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:01,261
Don't tell me to go away,
Stanley.

1750
01:40:01,304 --> 01:40:04,140
I'm the coordinator,
and you will answer me.

1751
01:40:07,059 --> 01:40:08,603
Now, what is going on?

1752
01:40:08,644 --> 01:40:11,229
- What's the problem?
- Nothing. I'm fine.

1753
01:40:11,271 --> 01:40:12,564
Why didn't you answer
those questions?

1754
01:40:12,606 --> 01:40:14,984
- I didn't know the answer.
- Bullshit!

1755
01:40:15,025 --> 01:40:16,569
You know the answer
to every goddamn question.

1756
01:40:16,610 --> 01:40:19,613
I knew the answers, and I'm not
half as smart as you ...

1757
01:40:19,654 --> 01:40:21,114
so what the hell happened?

1758
01:40:21,157 --> 01:40:23,492
He pissed his pants.

1759
01:40:23,533 --> 01:40:27,284
You pissed your pants?

1760
01:40:27,327 --> 01:40:28,786
No, I didn't.
I'm fine.

1761
01:40:28,828 --> 01:40:30,037
Stand up.

1762
01:40:30,078 --> 01:40:31,538
- I said I'm fine.
- Stand up.

1763
01:40:31,581 --> 01:40:35,417
Jesus, Stanley, what the fuck
did you do that for?

1764
01:40:35,460 --> 01:40:38,712
I just want to keep playing.
I'm fine.

1765
01:40:38,755 --> 01:40:40,172
That's great.

1766
01:40:40,213 --> 01:40:44,344
You know that to a performer,
that's food, right?

1767
01:40:44,385 --> 01:40:47,305
That shows that you love him,
and I'm sure he appreciates it.

1768
01:40:47,305 --> 01:40:49,140
Everything's fine. Relax.

1769
01:40:49,140 --> 01:40:50,600
Relax, darling.
Everything's fine.

1770
01:40:52,143 --> 01:40:53,895
I'm OK.

1771
01:40:53,936 --> 01:40:56,898
All right, see?
I'm all right.

1772
01:40:56,939 --> 01:40:58,649
It's pretty fucking stupid,
isn't it?

1773
01:40:58,690 --> 01:41:00,234
Jesus Christ.

1774
01:41:00,275 --> 01:41:02,362
What the fuck
do they think out there?

1775
01:41:02,403 --> 01:41:04,447
They must be laughing
their asses off.

1776
01:41:04,488 --> 01:41:06,407
Tell them I got a bad knee
or some fucking thing.

1777
01:41:06,448 --> 01:41:08,993
This is fucking funny.

1778
01:41:09,034 --> 01:41:11,871
- What do you want to do?
- Just what I said.

1779
01:41:16,456 --> 01:41:18,875
Are we going to continue
with this game?

1780
01:41:20,377 --> 01:41:22,503
All right, you look at me!

1781
01:41:22,545 --> 01:41:25,673
You are two days away
from this record.

1782
01:41:25,715 --> 01:41:27,132
Nobody's ever done that.

1783
01:41:27,175 --> 01:41:30,052
You get through this,
I'll get you anything you want.

1784
01:41:30,095 --> 01:41:32,305
You just got
to get through this.

1785
01:41:34,390 --> 01:41:36,725
Now, hang in there, buddy.

1786
01:41:36,725 --> 01:41:42,064
I'm sorry I squeezed your arm.
I love you.

1787
01:41:42,106 --> 01:41:45,025
- Are we doing this?
- Fucking stupidity.

1788
01:41:45,068 --> 01:41:46,319
Why don't I put the medic on?

1789
01:41:46,360 --> 01:41:48,654
I need to go with him.
Don't let him do this.

1790
01:41:48,697 --> 01:41:49,905
He's been doing it
for thirty years.

1791
01:41:49,948 --> 01:41:51,408
You don't know
how sick he really is.

1792
01:41:51,448 --> 01:41:52,993
It's a fucking game show, Mary.

1793
01:41:59,541 --> 01:42:01,501
Hear that?

1794
01:42:04,296 --> 01:42:06,086
Does that hurt?

1795
01:42:09,715 --> 01:42:13,342
- What is it?
- It's in my ear.

1796
01:42:13,385 --> 01:42:16,220
It's TMJ.

1797
01:42:16,262 --> 01:42:19,265
It's what it's called.
Technically.

1798
01:42:19,307 --> 01:42:23,604
How about they just call it,
"Clicking Jaw"?

1799
01:42:23,645 --> 01:42:26,480
- Pain in the jaw, yeah.
- How about that?

1800
01:42:26,523 --> 01:42:28,442
Easier to remember.

1801
01:42:28,483 --> 01:42:30,277
Yeah. It gets ...

1802
01:42:30,319 --> 01:42:33,779
I don't even know
if I have it, actually.

1803
01:42:38,868 --> 01:42:41,287
15-L-27,
I'm currently Code Seven.

1804
01:42:41,329 --> 01:42:43,289
I'm sorry.
This is my job.

1805
01:42:43,372 --> 01:42:44,916
15-L-27, roger.

1806
01:42:50,588 --> 01:42:53,550
We were just getting warmed up.

1807
01:42:53,550 --> 01:42:56,425
Yeah. I gotta go.

1808
01:42:56,466 --> 01:42:58,761
Well, if this joker
shows up again ...

1809
01:42:58,801 --> 01:43:01,220
or you got your music
up too loud ...

1810
01:43:01,220 --> 01:43:03,556
maybe we can have
another cup of coffee.

1811
01:43:03,599 --> 01:43:05,475
If you're not here for a 187.

1812
01:43:05,516 --> 01:43:09,104
No. Do not joke about that.

1813
01:43:11,856 --> 01:43:13,859
I seen too many of those.

1814
01:43:13,900 --> 01:43:15,610
I'm sorry.

1815
01:43:15,653 --> 01:43:17,070
It's all right.
You were kidding.

1816
01:43:17,070 --> 01:43:18,238
It's OK.

1817
01:43:21,240 --> 01:43:22,368
All right.

1818
01:43:22,408 --> 01:43:25,746
You keep your chin up
and your music down, OK?

1819
01:43:25,787 --> 01:43:28,207
Yes, I will. It was nice
to meet you, Officer Jim.

1820
01:43:28,247 --> 01:43:30,292
- Just Jim.
- Good.

1821
01:43:30,333 --> 01:43:32,711
Bye-bye, Claudia.

1822
01:43:59,652 --> 01:44:02,279
Yeah, what is it?
Did you forget something?

1823
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:04,823
No, I'm ...

1824
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:07,868
I was wondering ...

1825
01:44:07,909 --> 01:44:10,453
Man, I feel like a bit
of a scum bucket doing this ...

1826
01:44:10,496 --> 01:44:12,206
since I came here
as an officer of the law ...

1827
01:44:12,247 --> 01:44:14,082
and the situation
and everything ...

1828
01:44:14,125 --> 01:44:15,251
but I feel like I'd be a fool ...

1829
01:44:15,292 --> 01:44:16,793
if I didn't do something
I really want to do ...

1830
01:44:16,836 --> 01:44:18,128
which is to ask you for a date.

1831
01:44:18,170 --> 01:44:20,506
You want to go on a date
with me?

1832
01:44:20,547 --> 01:44:22,257
Please, yes.

1833
01:44:22,300 --> 01:44:24,719
- Well, is that illegal?
- Sort of.

1834
01:44:24,760 --> 01:44:27,137
Then I'd like to go.
What do you want to do?

1835
01:44:27,179 --> 01:44:31,057
I don't know.
I hadn't thought about it.

1836
01:44:31,057 --> 01:44:32,851
That's not true.
I have thought about it.

1837
01:44:32,893 --> 01:44:35,518
I've been thinking about it
since you opened the door.

1838
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:36,810
Really?

1839
01:44:36,853 --> 01:44:39,396
I thought you were flirting
with me a little.

1840
01:44:39,439 --> 01:44:41,024
You want to go tonight?

1841
01:44:41,064 --> 01:44:43,359
I'm off tonight, yeah.

1842
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:46,529
- What time?
- 8:00.

1843
01:44:46,570 --> 01:44:48,989
- I don't get off until 10:00.
- 10:00.

1844
01:44:51,283 --> 01:44:52,243
Yeah. Fine.

1845
01:44:52,284 --> 01:44:54,494
Yeah. Bye.

1846
01:44:55,872 --> 01:44:59,375
Frank, I'm really not trying
to attack you here.

1847
01:44:59,417 --> 01:45:04,296
I think if you have something
that needs to be cleared up ...

1848
01:45:08,926 --> 01:45:11,470
I was told that your father
is Earl Partridge.

1849
01:45:11,511 --> 01:45:14,806
I was told that he left
you and your mother ...

1850
01:45:14,849 --> 01:45:18,269
and you took care of your mother
during her illness ...

1851
01:45:18,310 --> 01:45:21,773
that you took care of her while
she struggled with cancer ...

1852
01:45:21,814 --> 01:45:24,359
and that Miss Simms
became your caretaker ...

1853
01:45:24,399 --> 01:45:26,899
when your mother
finally passed away.

1854
01:45:29,234 --> 01:45:32,072
Can you talk about
your mother, Frank?

1855
01:45:34,740 --> 01:45:37,077
No, no, not true.
And you know what?

1856
01:45:37,118 --> 01:45:38,578
Even if you don't
get to pump her ...

1857
01:45:38,619 --> 01:45:41,831
you still need to practice
your skills on a feminist.

1858
01:45:41,872 --> 01:45:43,332
I will.

1859
01:45:43,375 --> 01:45:44,833
You need to do that.
This is Doc.

1860
01:45:44,876 --> 01:45:48,421
Doc, it's Janet.
I have to talk to Frank.

1861
01:45:48,462 --> 01:45:49,713
He's in the interview, Janet.

1862
01:45:49,756 --> 01:45:50,881
Interrupt him.

1863
01:45:50,923 --> 01:45:53,176
Get him on the phone
with me right away.

1864
01:45:53,217 --> 01:45:54,344
What happened?

1865
01:45:54,386 --> 01:45:56,805
Doc, go get Frank
and put him on the phone.

1866
01:45:58,681 --> 01:46:01,643
Come on, Frank.

1867
01:46:01,685 --> 01:46:03,185
What are you doing?

1868
01:46:06,064 --> 01:46:07,356
What am I doing?

1869
01:46:12,279 --> 01:46:15,529
I'm quietly judging you.

1870
01:46:16,822 --> 01:46:21,618
And five, four, three, two ...

1871
01:46:26,163 --> 01:46:28,500
Oh, boy, what a day.
What a round.

1872
01:46:28,542 --> 01:46:30,335
Back and in for me and ...

1873
01:46:30,377 --> 01:46:33,005
and the final
one-on-one round ...

1874
01:46:33,046 --> 01:46:35,340
to determine who's who today.

1875
01:46:35,381 --> 01:46:39,051
Let's check the scores
on the board, shall we?

1876
01:46:39,094 --> 01:46:41,971
Well, the kids
have an even 2,000 ...

1877
01:46:42,014 --> 01:46:46,350
and the adults
are way up with forty-seven.

1878
01:46:46,393 --> 01:46:48,436
Now, that doesn't mean
that this game ...

1879
01:46:48,478 --> 01:46:51,898
is out of reach for the kids.

1880
01:46:51,939 --> 01:46:54,443
Elders,
who's the lucky so-and-so?

1881
01:46:54,484 --> 01:46:56,903
It's me, Jimmy.

1882
01:46:56,944 --> 01:46:58,572
Come on over, Mim.

1883
01:46:59,989 --> 01:47:02,951
I don't want to go.
I can't do it this time.

1884
01:47:02,993 --> 01:47:05,117
What the fuck are you
talking about?

1885
01:47:05,158 --> 01:47:07,953
You have to go, Stanley.
You're the smartest.

1886
01:47:07,994 --> 01:47:11,164
I don't want to go.
Why can't one of you do it?

1887
01:47:11,206 --> 01:47:13,167
If you don't fucking stand up
and get over there ...

1888
01:47:13,167 --> 01:47:15,168
I'll beat your ass.

1889
01:47:15,210 --> 01:47:18,922
I'm sick of being the one,
always has to do everything.

1890
01:47:18,963 --> 01:47:20,966
I don't want
to be the one always.

1891
01:47:21,007 --> 01:47:23,176
Kids, I don't even have to ask.

1892
01:47:23,217 --> 01:47:25,011
Stanley,
get your butt over here.

1893
01:47:32,519 --> 01:47:34,854
I'm sick.

1894
01:47:34,854 --> 01:47:36,398
I'm sick here now.

1895
01:47:37,942 --> 01:47:41,694
I confuse melancholy
with depression sometimes.

1896
01:47:41,737 --> 01:47:43,447
You see?

1897
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:45,157
Why don't you run along now,
friend?

1898
01:47:45,198 --> 01:47:47,076
Your dessert is getting cold.

1899
01:47:47,117 --> 01:47:50,119
- I'm sick.
- Stay that way.

1900
01:47:50,162 --> 01:47:51,997
I'm sick, and I'm in love.

1901
01:47:52,038 --> 01:47:55,789
You seem the sort of person
who confuses the two.

1902
01:47:55,831 --> 01:47:57,750
That's right!

1903
01:47:57,792 --> 01:48:00,502
That's the first time
you've been right.

1904
01:48:00,543 --> 01:48:03,506
I confuse the two,
and I don't care!

1905
01:48:08,010 --> 01:48:11,055
I love you.

1906
01:48:11,096 --> 01:48:12,974
I love you, and I'm sick.

1907
01:48:13,015 --> 01:48:15,393
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

1908
01:48:15,434 --> 01:48:17,310
I'm getting corrective
oral surgery tomorrow ...

1909
01:48:17,353 --> 01:48:19,313
for my teeth.

1910
01:48:19,354 --> 01:48:20,773
I love you, Brad.

1911
01:48:20,814 --> 01:48:22,315
Brad the bartender.

1912
01:48:22,358 --> 01:48:24,777
If you want to love me back,
I'll be good to you.

1913
01:48:24,819 --> 01:48:26,654
I'll be goddamn good for you.

1914
01:48:26,695 --> 01:48:29,823
I won't be mad if you
don't know who said what.

1915
01:48:29,864 --> 01:48:33,411
I won't punish you
if you get the answer wrong.

1916
01:48:33,452 --> 01:48:34,787
I can teach and tell you ...

1917
01:48:34,828 --> 01:48:37,707
You have a special secret crush
over there, I think.

1918
01:48:37,747 --> 01:48:39,958
Don't treat him too lovely.
He might get hurt.

1919
01:48:40,001 --> 01:48:41,752
You shut up!
Mind your own business.

1920
01:48:41,793 --> 01:48:42,920
Gently, son!

1921
01:48:42,962 --> 01:48:44,421
Brad,
I know you don't love me now.

1922
01:48:44,462 --> 01:48:48,840
It's a dangerous thing
to confuse children with angels.

1923
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:52,051
Want to know the common element
for the entire group?

1924
01:48:52,092 --> 01:48:54,595
I'll tell you the answer,
because I had that one.

1925
01:48:54,636 --> 01:48:56,555
I had that question.

1926
01:48:56,597 --> 01:48:59,934
Carbon. Carbon.

1927
01:48:59,975 --> 01:49:02,145
In pencil lead,
it's in the form of graphite.

1928
01:49:02,185 --> 01:49:05,314
In coal, it's mixed up
with other impurities.

1929
01:49:05,355 --> 01:49:08,443
And in the diamond,
it's in hard form.

1930
01:49:08,484 --> 01:49:12,738
All we really wanted to know
was the common element ...

1931
01:49:12,779 --> 01:49:14,615
but thank you for all
that unnecessary knowledge.

1932
01:49:14,657 --> 01:49:17,868
Kids. Heads so full
of useless knowledge.

1933
01:49:17,911 --> 01:49:19,287
Thank you. Thank you.

1934
01:49:20,913 --> 01:49:23,373
And the book says, "We may be
through with the past ...

1935
01:49:23,416 --> 01:49:26,752
"but the past is not
through with us!"

1936
01:49:26,793 --> 01:49:28,630
And ...

1937
01:49:28,671 --> 01:49:30,965
no, it is not dangerous ...

1938
01:49:31,006 --> 01:49:33,216
to confuse children with angels.

1939
01:49:47,354 --> 01:49:51,233
Well, that is what I wait for.

1940
01:49:51,274 --> 01:49:54,735
I wait for those calls.
And I wait and I pray.

1941
01:49:54,778 --> 01:49:57,780
And sometimes Jesus says ...

1942
01:49:57,780 --> 01:50:00,242
"Jim, I got a surprise
for you today.

1943
01:50:00,283 --> 01:50:02,868
"I want you to meet
this young lady, OK?

1944
01:50:02,911 --> 01:50:05,788
"Now, where it goes
from there is up to you.

1945
01:50:05,829 --> 01:50:08,541
"And I don't think
you're going to screw it up."

1946
01:50:08,582 --> 01:50:11,543
And, God,
I'm telling you right now ...

1947
01:50:11,586 --> 01:50:13,546
I will not screw it up.

1948
01:50:13,587 --> 01:50:15,256
You gave me an opportunity.

1949
01:50:15,297 --> 01:50:17,050
I'm going to treat
this young lady right.

1950
01:50:17,091 --> 01:50:20,261
I'm a happy cop.

1951
01:50:20,302 --> 01:50:23,640
It's called jaywalking.
Slow down.

1952
01:50:54,167 --> 01:50:56,587
I'm going to pass, Jimmy.

1953
01:50:56,627 --> 01:50:59,715
Stanley, passing
to one of the other kids.

1954
01:51:01,173 --> 01:51:03,760
We want Stanley to go, Jimmy.

1955
01:51:05,136 --> 01:51:08,180
I don't want to go.

1956
01:51:08,222 --> 01:51:10,141
I'm walking towards
the elevator, Janet.

1957
01:51:10,182 --> 01:51:11,893
Fine. Phil,
are you still there?

1958
01:51:11,935 --> 01:51:13,060
Yeah, I'm here.

1959
01:51:13,103 --> 01:51:14,563
I want to ask you one question.

1960
01:51:14,604 --> 01:51:17,354
Phil, have you talked
to anyone else about this?

1961
01:51:17,395 --> 01:51:18,354
No, I haven't.

1962
01:51:18,396 --> 01:51:20,315
Good, let's keep it that way.

1963
01:51:20,356 --> 01:51:22,609
All the security and whatnot.
You understand?

1964
01:51:22,650 --> 01:51:25,279
This is a delicate situation
for Frank and the family.

1965
01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:26,697
What's going on, Janet?

1966
01:51:26,738 --> 01:51:28,114
Doc, fuck off.

1967
01:51:28,157 --> 01:51:30,158
Phil, hang in
just one more minute.

1968
01:51:30,199 --> 01:51:32,703
- I'm putting you on hold.
- Thank you.

1969
01:51:32,744 --> 01:51:33,996
How close are you, Doc?

1970
01:51:34,037 --> 01:51:40,210
Richard? Julia?
Kids, what's going on?

1971
01:51:40,252 --> 01:51:42,796
I need a player here
for one-on-one.

1972
01:51:42,837 --> 01:51:47,384
We want Stanley to go, Jimmy,
and we're not sure why he won't.

1973
01:51:47,426 --> 01:51:50,304
I always answer the questions ...

1974
01:51:50,345 --> 01:51:51,971
and I don't want
to do it anymore.

1975
01:51:52,014 --> 01:51:55,725
What the fuck is he doing?
What's wrong with him?

1976
01:51:55,768 --> 01:51:57,185
I have no idea.

1977
01:52:00,689 --> 01:52:02,649
I'm getting off of the elevator,
Janet.

1978
01:52:02,690 --> 01:52:05,565
Good. Good boy.

1979
01:52:05,608 --> 01:52:09,069
I'm walking down the hall.

1980
01:52:58,115 --> 01:53:02,578
This kid ain't getting up,
we don't have a show.

1981
01:53:02,619 --> 01:53:04,747
Live television,
ladies and germs.

1982
01:53:04,788 --> 01:53:06,416
Little prick.

1983
01:53:06,457 --> 01:53:09,293
What's this, a point?
A game?

1984
01:53:09,293 --> 01:53:11,170
What the hell's he doing?

1985
01:53:11,212 --> 01:53:15,257
Get the fuck up, kid, come on.

1986
01:53:20,179 --> 01:53:21,471
Time's up.

1987
01:53:23,307 --> 01:53:26,310
So that's what you did?
You sat it out?

1988
01:53:27,645 --> 01:53:31,565
You wanted my time.
I gave it to you.

1989
01:53:31,608 --> 01:53:34,903
You called me a liar.
You made accusations.

1990
01:53:34,944 --> 01:53:37,988
You said,
"Well, if I had known ...

1991
01:53:38,030 --> 01:53:39,908
"then I wouldn't have asked."

1992
01:53:39,948 --> 01:53:42,493
So it's not an attack.

1993
01:53:42,534 --> 01:53:46,828
I don't want to be the sort
who doesn't keep his word.

1994
01:53:46,869 --> 01:53:49,204
So I gave you
my fucking time, bitch.

1995
01:53:49,204 --> 01:53:50,372
Now, fuck ...

1996
01:53:57,005 --> 01:53:58,131
It's fucking Janet.

1997
01:53:58,172 --> 01:53:59,841
There's a situation
on the phone.

1998
01:54:22,279 --> 01:54:25,408
The indecision of a child,
ladies and germs.

1999
01:54:37,125 --> 01:54:40,587
This isn't funny.

2000
01:54:40,628 --> 01:54:42,756
This isn't cute.

2001
01:54:42,797 --> 01:54:44,757
See, the way we're looked at?

2002
01:54:47,301 --> 01:54:49,930
Because I'm not a toy.

2003
01:54:49,971 --> 01:54:51,556
I'm not a doll.

2004
01:54:51,597 --> 01:54:55,644
The way we're looked at
because you think we're cute?

2005
01:54:55,685 --> 01:54:57,645
Because − What?

2006
01:54:57,645 --> 01:55:00,649
I'm made to feel like a freak ...

2007
01:55:00,690 --> 01:55:03,150
if I answer questions ...

2008
01:55:03,150 --> 01:55:04,569
or I'm smart ...

2009
01:55:06,822 --> 01:55:09,490
or I have to go to the bathroom?

2010
01:55:10,701 --> 01:55:13,494
What is that, Jimmy?

2011
01:55:13,537 --> 01:55:15,372
What is that?

2012
01:55:15,413 --> 01:55:18,041
I'm asking you that.

2013
01:55:18,082 --> 01:55:21,002
I'm not sure, Stanley.

2014
01:56:01,414 --> 01:56:04,335
15-L-27, I need help.

2015
01:56:04,376 --> 01:56:05,793
We have shots fired.

2016
01:56:10,298 --> 01:56:14,427
It's Hamlet to Claudius.

2017
01:56:14,470 --> 01:56:17,427
"The sins of the father
laid upon the children ..."

2018
01:56:17,470 --> 01:56:19,346
is "Merchant of Venice."

2019
01:56:19,387 --> 01:56:23,809
But borrowed from "Exodus" 25.

2020
01:56:23,809 --> 01:56:24,935
I'm sorry, Frank.

2021
01:56:24,976 --> 01:56:27,104
I didn't know what else
you wanted me to do.

2022
01:56:27,145 --> 01:56:29,731
I asked him
all the right questions.

2023
01:56:29,774 --> 01:56:32,484
He's his nurse.
He's sitting there with him.

2024
01:56:32,525 --> 01:56:34,612
I heard your father's voice
in the background.

2025
01:56:34,654 --> 01:56:37,907
Wait.
He's there at their house?

2026
01:56:37,948 --> 01:56:39,324
They're at the house.

2027
01:56:39,367 --> 01:56:43,996
I asked him the exact address,
and he gave it.

2028
01:56:44,037 --> 01:56:47,332
I know this is really hard
for you right now.

2029
01:56:47,375 --> 01:56:51,127
If you're gonna give me things,
give me the information.

2030
01:56:51,170 --> 01:56:53,797
I want the information.
That's what I want.

2031
01:56:53,838 --> 01:56:55,131
What did he say?

2032
01:56:55,173 --> 01:56:56,425
Because I am not
taking care of him.

2033
01:56:56,466 --> 01:56:58,719
What does he want?

2034
01:56:58,761 --> 01:57:02,347
Frank, what the fuck
do you want me to do?

2035
01:57:02,390 --> 01:57:04,100
What I want you to do, Janet ...

2036
01:57:04,140 --> 01:57:07,140
is I want you to do
your fucking job!

2037
01:57:07,182 --> 01:57:10,520
I am doing my fucking job!

2038
01:57:10,561 --> 01:57:13,021
You fucking get on the phone.

2039
01:57:20,363 --> 01:57:22,323
I'm not a doll!
I'm not silly and cute!

2040
01:57:22,364 --> 01:57:24,033
I'm smart, so that
should make me something ...

2041
01:57:24,074 --> 01:57:27,203
something so people can watch
how silly it is he's smart!

2042
01:57:27,244 --> 01:57:28,912
I know. I know things.

2043
01:57:28,954 --> 01:57:31,039
I know − I know ...

2044
01:57:31,082 --> 01:57:35,043
I know I have to go
to the bathroom and I asked ...

2045
01:57:35,086 --> 01:57:37,505
Take us off the air.
Go to the credits.

2046
01:57:37,546 --> 01:57:39,591
Roll the credits.

2047
01:57:39,631 --> 01:57:41,926
God fucking damn it!
Son of a bitch!

2048
01:57:41,967 --> 01:57:43,970
What the fuck?!
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

2049
01:57:44,011 --> 01:57:45,596
Stanley, don't do this to me!

2050
01:58:07,698 --> 01:58:09,783
I got to find that gun.

2051
01:58:09,826 --> 01:58:11,328
Where is it, now?

2052
01:58:12,787 --> 01:58:14,079
Where is it?

2053
01:58:17,125 --> 01:58:19,502
All right, let's go.

2054
01:58:19,543 --> 01:58:21,837
Where is it? Find it.

2055
01:58:24,006 --> 01:58:25,341
Find it!

2056
01:58:27,010 --> 01:58:28,720
Find the gun, Jim!

2057
01:59:04,293 --> 01:59:07,881
What the fuck more
do you want me to say?

2058
01:59:07,922 --> 01:59:10,759
You need to make a decision.

2059
01:59:10,759 --> 01:59:13,095
Look, just give me a second.

2060
01:59:14,095 --> 01:59:15,846
Give me a second.

2061
01:59:22,770 --> 01:59:24,689
What the fuck, Frank?

2062
01:59:24,730 --> 01:59:27,067
What do you want me to do?

2063
01:59:56,801 --> 02:00:00,471
- What are you doing?
- I got Frank, Earl's son.

2064
02:00:00,514 --> 02:00:03,100
- Hang up the phone.
- No, he asked me ...

2065
02:00:03,141 --> 02:00:04,643
Put the fucking phone down!

2066
02:00:04,685 --> 02:00:06,060
- Hang it up!
- I can't!

2067
02:00:06,103 --> 02:00:10,649
Frank, are you there?

2068
02:00:10,690 --> 02:00:13,027
I want you to talk to him.

2069
02:00:21,409 --> 02:00:23,203
I'm going put him on.

2070
02:00:23,244 --> 02:00:25,786
Hang it up!
You don't do that!

2071
02:00:25,828 --> 02:00:27,704
You don't call him.
You don't know.

2072
02:00:27,747 --> 02:00:30,541
To get involved in this business
of his − my family.

2073
02:00:30,582 --> 02:00:33,586
This is the family.
Me and him. Understand?

2074
02:00:33,586 --> 02:00:35,880
There's no one else.
No one else!

2075
02:00:35,921 --> 02:00:39,341
That man − that beautiful man ...

2076
02:00:39,382 --> 02:00:43,386
his son does not exist.
He's dead.

2077
02:00:43,429 --> 02:00:45,430
Who asked you to do that?

2078
02:00:45,472 --> 02:00:47,934
- Earl did.
- Bullshit!

2079
02:00:47,975 --> 02:00:49,851
Bullshit!
He didn't ask you!

2080
02:00:49,894 --> 02:00:52,354
He doesn't want to talk to him!

2081
02:00:52,395 --> 02:00:54,564
So fuck you that he asked that!

2082
02:00:54,606 --> 02:00:58,944
There's no one but me and him!
No one!

2083
02:00:58,985 --> 02:01:02,113
He asked me.

2084
02:01:02,155 --> 02:01:05,451
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

2085
02:01:27,511 --> 02:01:31,265
Mary, take me out of here.
I got to go home to Rose.

2086
02:01:31,306 --> 02:01:32,475
Mary, take him home.

2087
02:01:32,516 --> 02:01:35,060
- In the back.
- Did we win or lose?

2088
02:01:35,103 --> 02:01:36,479
I don't know, Richard.

2089
02:01:36,520 --> 02:01:39,314
You lost. They go to the score
the time they called it.

2090
02:01:39,356 --> 02:01:41,024
That's not an official rule,
Luis.

2091
02:01:41,067 --> 02:01:43,360
That's an official rule, baby.

2092
02:01:43,403 --> 02:01:44,654
That's bullshit,
and you know it!

2093
02:01:44,695 --> 02:01:46,738
Who says that?
In what rule book?

2094
02:01:46,780 --> 02:01:48,198
This is different!
It's a game show!

2095
02:01:48,240 --> 02:01:50,158
They don't go by
fucking sports rules!

2096
02:01:50,201 --> 02:01:52,412
Richard, shut it and cut it out.

2097
02:01:52,453 --> 02:01:54,162
If he hadn't
pissed his pants ...

2098
02:01:54,204 --> 02:01:55,789
we would have won
this little mother fucker!

2099
02:01:55,832 --> 02:01:56,957
We had it!

2100
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:00,168
What'd you do with
my goddamn kid, Burt?

2101
02:02:00,211 --> 02:02:03,840
Get your fucking hands off me,
you boy producer punk.

2102
02:02:03,881 --> 02:02:07,506
Oh, Lord,
why is this happening to me?

2103
02:02:08,591 --> 02:02:11,219
God, please help me
figure it out.

2104
02:02:11,261 --> 02:02:13,137
I'm lost out here.

2105
02:02:14,680 --> 02:02:17,182
I don't understand
why it's happening, God.

2106
02:02:17,225 --> 02:02:18,894
Please, God.

2107
02:02:22,021 --> 02:02:23,939
Whatever it is I did,
I'll fix it.

2108
02:02:23,939 --> 02:02:25,649
I'll do the right thing.

2109
02:02:25,692 --> 02:02:27,527
Please, God,
help me find the gun.

2110
02:04:27,850 --> 02:04:29,475
Listen, Phil.

2111
02:04:33,104 --> 02:04:35,604
I'm sorry.

2112
02:04:35,645 --> 02:04:40,359
I'm sorry I slapped your face.

2113
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:42,987
I don't know what I'm doing.

2114
02:04:43,029 --> 02:04:45,363
I don't know how to do this.

2115
02:04:47,490 --> 02:04:49,493
I do things, and I fuck up.

2116
02:04:51,369 --> 02:04:53,122
I fucked up.

2117
02:04:54,582 --> 02:04:57,083
Can you forgive me?

2118
02:04:57,126 --> 02:04:59,545
It's all right.

2119
02:05:05,676 --> 02:05:09,137
Can you tell him I'm sorry ...

2120
02:05:09,180 --> 02:05:12,975
for the things I've done,
that I fucked up?

2121
02:05:13,016 --> 02:05:15,520
I'm sorry.

2122
02:05:15,603 --> 02:05:18,230
I'm going to turn away
and walk away ...

2123
02:05:18,271 --> 02:05:21,484
and not look at him,
and not see my man, my Earl.

2124
02:05:21,525 --> 02:05:24,444
And tell him ...

2125
02:05:24,487 --> 02:05:27,819
"It's OK. I'm OK."

2126
02:05:29,029 --> 02:05:31,698
Tell him,
"Thank you for taking care ..."

2127
02:05:34,077 --> 02:05:38,288
The whole thing's OK with me.

2128
02:05:38,331 --> 02:05:39,748
And I know.

2129
02:06:03,523 --> 02:06:05,942
Welcome back from the break!

2130
02:06:09,362 --> 02:06:12,323
How'd you guys
like those nachos?

2131
02:06:13,867 --> 02:06:16,783
You are not here
for the fucking food.

2132
02:06:16,824 --> 02:06:21,746
You are here for me
to enlighten you, edify you ...

2133
02:06:21,787 --> 02:06:25,542
to send you off into the now
not-so-unknown future.

2134
02:06:25,583 --> 02:06:27,460
So come along with me.

2135
02:06:27,502 --> 02:06:30,462
"How to fake like you
are nice and caring."

2136
02:06:30,505 --> 02:06:32,798
No, I don't want a microphone.

2137
02:06:32,841 --> 02:06:34,759
Now, this ...

2138
02:06:34,801 --> 02:06:37,011
this is quite
an important chapter ...

2139
02:06:37,052 --> 02:06:39,514
as you will see.

2140
02:06:39,555 --> 02:06:40,931
But let's get down
to brass tacks.

2141
02:06:40,974 --> 02:06:44,560
Let's get right down to it,
boys.

2142
02:06:44,603 --> 02:06:48,273
Men are shit.

2143
02:06:49,858 --> 02:06:55,447
What? Men are shit.

2144
02:06:55,488 --> 02:06:57,573
Isn't that what they say?

2145
02:06:57,615 --> 02:06:59,201
Because we do bad things,
don't we?

2146
02:06:59,242 --> 02:07:05,078
We do horrible, heinous,
terrible things.

2147
02:07:05,119 --> 02:07:11,001
Things that no woman
would ever do.

2148
02:07:11,042 --> 02:07:14,046
No, women, they don't lie.

2149
02:07:14,087 --> 02:07:16,172
No, women don't cheat.

2150
02:07:16,215 --> 02:07:19,009
Women don't manipulate us.

2151
02:07:21,220 --> 02:07:24,640
But you see what I'm getting at.

2152
02:07:24,680 --> 02:07:26,432
You see what society does?

2153
02:07:26,475 --> 02:07:30,270
Little boys, it's, "Wow, woman!"

2154
02:07:32,314 --> 02:07:33,774
We are taught to apologize.

2155
02:07:33,814 --> 02:07:35,525
"I am sorry.

2156
02:07:35,567 --> 02:07:38,362
"I am so sorry, baby.
I am so sorry."

2157
02:07:42,240 --> 02:07:44,534
What is it that ...

2158
02:07:44,576 --> 02:07:47,119
What is it that we need?

2159
02:07:47,162 --> 02:07:51,542
Is it their pussies?
Their love?

2160
02:07:51,582 --> 02:07:53,460
Mommy wouldn't
let me play soccer ...

2161
02:07:53,502 --> 02:07:57,920
and Daddy, he hit me,
so that's who I am.

2162
02:07:57,962 --> 02:08:00,256
That's why I do what I do?

2163
02:08:00,296 --> 02:08:02,507
Fucking bullshit.

2164
02:08:07,136 --> 02:08:11,475
I will not apologize
for who I am.

2165
02:08:11,516 --> 02:08:15,270
I will not apologize
for what I need.

2166
02:08:15,311 --> 02:08:20,693
I will not apologize
for what I want!

2167
02:08:22,319 --> 02:08:23,737
Go to your blue booklets now.

2168
02:08:23,779 --> 02:08:27,783
I want you to turn to page 18
in your blue booklets.

2169
02:08:29,201 --> 02:08:33,538
This is fucking bullshit!

2170
02:08:33,581 --> 02:08:37,292
I want you to go
to your white books.

2171
02:08:37,333 --> 02:08:39,712
That's what I want you to go to.

2172
02:08:39,752 --> 02:08:42,088
Go to twenty-three
in your white books.

2173
02:08:43,716 --> 02:08:47,507
"How to fake like you are
a nice and caring person."

2174
02:08:54,640 --> 02:08:57,894
Hey, come here.

2175
02:09:02,939 --> 02:09:05,359
I'm ...

2176
02:09:05,400 --> 02:09:08,487
I'm gonna try talk.

2177
02:09:08,529 --> 02:09:11,032
You know, I'm trying to ...

2178
02:09:11,073 --> 02:09:12,617
to say something-something.

2179
02:09:14,493 --> 02:09:17,662
Do you know Lily, Phil?
Do you know her?

2180
02:09:20,332 --> 02:09:22,376
No, I don't.

2181
02:09:22,417 --> 02:09:27,840
She's my love, my life,
love of it.

2182
02:09:27,881 --> 02:09:30,217
In school ...

2183
02:09:30,259 --> 02:09:34,346
I'm twelve years old in school,
in sixth grade.

2184
02:09:34,387 --> 02:09:35,929
I saw her.

2185
02:09:37,221 --> 02:09:40,557
I didn't go to that school,
but ...

2186
02:09:42,018 --> 02:09:44,895
but we met.

2187
02:09:44,938 --> 02:09:47,731
My friend knew her.

2188
02:09:47,774 --> 02:09:50,734
I said ...

2189
02:09:50,777 --> 02:09:53,654
"What's that girl?
How's that Lily?"

2190
02:09:53,695 --> 02:09:58,201
"Oh, she's bad.
She sleeps with guys."

2191
02:09:58,243 --> 02:10:02,162
Yeah, he said this,
but then sometimes ...

2192
02:10:02,204 --> 02:10:05,457
I went to another school,
you see.

2193
02:10:05,500 --> 02:10:09,378
But then ...

2194
02:10:09,420 --> 02:10:12,256
When high school at an end,
what's that?

2195
02:10:12,297 --> 02:10:15,092
What is that when
it gets to the end?

2196
02:10:15,092 --> 02:10:16,301
Graduation.

2197
02:10:16,344 --> 02:10:19,055
No, no, the grade.
What grade are you in?

2198
02:10:19,096 --> 02:10:23,518
That's 12th.

2199
02:10:23,560 --> 02:10:28,185
So I went to her school
for that grade.

2200
02:10:28,228 --> 02:10:31,273
Grade − that's grade twelve.

2201
02:10:31,314 --> 02:10:33,358
And we meet.

2202
02:10:34,818 --> 02:10:35,985
She was ...

2203
02:10:37,737 --> 02:10:40,239
fucking like a doll.

2204
02:10:42,033 --> 02:10:45,494
A beautiful porcelain doll.

2205
02:10:45,494 --> 02:10:47,454
And the hips ...

2206
02:10:47,497 --> 02:10:49,791
The child-bearing hips,
you know that?

2207
02:10:49,832 --> 02:10:51,167
I know.

2208
02:10:51,208 --> 02:10:54,587
So beautiful.

2209
02:11:00,342 --> 02:11:02,345
And I cheated on her ...

2210
02:11:02,386 --> 02:11:08,475
over and over and over again.

2211
02:11:08,518 --> 02:11:10,979
Because I wanted to be a man.

2212
02:11:11,020 --> 02:11:14,854
And I didn't want her
to be a woman.

2213
02:11:14,896 --> 02:11:22,820
A smart, free person
who was something.

2214
02:11:22,904 --> 02:11:25,157
My fucking mind then.

2215
02:11:27,826 --> 02:11:29,786
So stupid, that fucking mind.

2216
02:11:29,828 --> 02:11:31,747
Stupid.

2217
02:11:31,747 --> 02:11:33,748
Jesus Christ!

2218
02:11:35,417 --> 02:11:37,252
What would I think?

2219
02:11:37,252 --> 02:11:40,338
Did I think for what I'd done?

2220
02:11:42,090 --> 02:11:45,594
She was my wife
for twenty-three years ...

2221
02:11:45,636 --> 02:11:50,724
and I went behind her
over and over.

2222
02:11:50,765 --> 02:11:52,184
Fucking asshole that I am.

2223
02:11:52,225 --> 02:11:55,354
I'd go out and I'd fuck ...

2224
02:11:55,395 --> 02:11:59,274
and I'd come home
and get in her bed ...

2225
02:11:59,315 --> 02:12:03,862
and say, "I love you."

2226
02:12:03,904 --> 02:12:07,320
This is Jack's mother.

2227
02:12:07,363 --> 02:12:10,114
His mother, Lily.

2228
02:12:10,157 --> 02:12:11,617
These two ...

2229
02:12:13,828 --> 02:12:15,078
that I had ...

2230
02:12:17,914 --> 02:12:19,542
and I lost.

2231
02:12:22,168 --> 02:12:26,548
This is the regret
that you make.

2232
02:12:28,050 --> 02:12:29,635
This is the ...

2233
02:12:32,846 --> 02:12:36,809
regret that you make
and the something you take ...

2234
02:12:36,850 --> 02:12:40,813
and the blah, blah, blah ...

2235
02:12:40,854 --> 02:12:42,730
something, something.

2236
02:12:45,900 --> 02:12:47,235
Gimme a cigarette.

2237
02:13:15,970 --> 02:13:18,014
Mistakes like this ...

2238
02:13:19,390 --> 02:13:21,057
you don't make.

2239
02:13:22,685 --> 02:13:24,520
Sometimes ...

2240
02:13:26,354 --> 02:13:29,524
you make some and OK.

2241
02:13:31,068 --> 02:13:35,573
Not OK, sometimes,
you make other ones.

2242
02:13:37,783 --> 02:13:39,952
Know that you should do better.

2243
02:13:43,456 --> 02:13:45,497
I loved Lily.

2244
02:13:48,500 --> 02:13:50,627
I cheated on her.

2245
02:13:53,046 --> 02:13:55,840
She was my wife
for twenty-three years.

2246
02:13:59,969 --> 02:14:02,346
And I have a son.

2247
02:14:02,387 --> 02:14:04,140
And she has cancer.

2248
02:14:05,557 --> 02:14:07,685
And I'm not there ...

2249
02:14:07,726 --> 02:14:11,439
and he's forced
to take care of her.

2250
02:14:12,524 --> 02:14:15,318
He's fourteen years old.

2251
02:14:15,359 --> 02:14:16,694
To ...

2252
02:14:19,322 --> 02:14:23,076
To take care of his mother
and ...

2253
02:14:23,117 --> 02:14:26,412
and watch her die on him.

2254
02:14:27,913 --> 02:14:33,252
A little kid, and I'm not there.

2255
02:14:36,711 --> 02:14:38,630
And she does die.

2256
02:14:45,261 --> 02:14:47,346
I loved her so.

2257
02:14:48,931 --> 02:14:51,225
And she knew what I did.

2258
02:14:51,268 --> 02:14:55,354
She knew all the fucking
stupid things I'd done.

2259
02:14:57,690 --> 02:15:00,402
But the love ...

2260
02:15:00,443 --> 02:15:03,404
was stronger than anything
you can think of.

2261
02:15:05,198 --> 02:15:07,408
The goddamn regret.

2262
02:15:18,086 --> 02:15:20,296
And I'll die.

2263
02:15:20,337 --> 02:15:26,091
Now I'll die,
and I'll tell you what ...

2264
02:15:26,132 --> 02:15:28,886
the biggest regret of my life ...

2265
02:15:32,847 --> 02:15:34,807
I let my love go.

2266
02:15:36,185 --> 02:15:38,645
What did I do?

2267
02:15:41,105 --> 02:15:43,108
I'm sixty-five years old.

2268
02:15:44,693 --> 02:15:46,987
And I'm ashamed.

2269
02:15:48,238 --> 02:15:50,407
Million years ago ...

2270
02:15:53,034 --> 02:15:59,625
The fucking regret and guilt,
these things ...

2271
02:15:59,666 --> 02:16:03,420
Don't ever let anyone
ever say to you ...

2272
02:16:03,462 --> 02:16:05,881
you shouldn't regret anything.

2273
02:16:05,922 --> 02:16:10,260
Don't do that.

2274
02:16:10,301 --> 02:16:13,055
You regret
what you fucking want.

2275
02:16:13,095 --> 02:16:15,720
Use that. Use that.

2276
02:16:15,762 --> 02:16:19,975
Use that regret for anything,
any way you want.

2277
02:16:20,016 --> 02:16:21,976
You can use it, OK?

2278
02:16:24,354 --> 02:16:25,814
Oh, God.

2279
02:16:28,609 --> 02:16:34,406
This is a long way to go
with no punch.

2280
02:16:34,448 --> 02:16:38,076
A little moral ...

2281
02:16:38,118 --> 02:16:39,495
Story, I say.

2282
02:16:42,456 --> 02:16:44,791
Love.

2283
02:16:51,381 --> 02:16:53,884
This fucking life ...

2284
02:16:58,888 --> 02:17:01,225
it's so fucking hard.

2285
02:17:01,266 --> 02:17:03,769
So long.

2286
02:17:05,016 --> 02:17:07,602
Life ain't short.
It's long.

2287
02:17:10,022 --> 02:17:13,234
It's long, God damn it.

2288
02:17:13,275 --> 02:17:16,404
God damn.

2289
02:17:20,449 --> 02:17:23,076
What did I do?

2290
02:17:34,004 --> 02:17:38,217
Phil. Phil, help me.

2291
02:17:42,138 --> 02:17:44,139
What did I do?

2292
02:17:53,231 --> 02:17:55,397
Juan, how you doing?

2293
02:17:55,440 --> 02:17:56,691
How you feeling?

2294
02:17:56,733 --> 02:17:59,652
I think I'm going to stay on,
stick it out.

2295
02:17:59,693 --> 02:18:01,654
Are you sure?

2296
02:18:01,695 --> 02:18:03,031
All right, good night.

2297
02:19:19,478 --> 02:19:21,230
You're so stupid.

2298
02:19:23,441 --> 02:19:27,111
Is love

2299
02:19:27,154 --> 02:19:29,989
What you thought

2300
02:19:31,575 --> 02:19:34,534
When you first

2301
02:19:34,576 --> 02:19:38,703
Began, yeah

2302
02:19:38,745 --> 02:19:40,914
You got

2303
02:19:42,373 --> 02:19:45,042
What you want

2304
02:19:46,545 --> 02:19:52,009
You can hardly stand it, though

2305
02:19:52,049 --> 02:19:55,845
By now you know it's not

2306
02:19:55,888 --> 02:19:59,975
Going to stop

2307
02:20:00,016 --> 02:20:06,606
It's not going to stop

2308
02:20:08,649 --> 02:20:14,781
It's not going to stop

2309
02:20:14,823 --> 02:20:19,286
Till you wise up

2310
02:20:24,248 --> 02:20:26,623
You're sure

2311
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,460
There's a cure

2312
02:20:32,296 --> 02:20:39,136
And you have finally found it

2313
02:20:39,177 --> 02:20:41,846
You think

2314
02:20:43,264 --> 02:20:45,643
One drink

2315
02:20:47,310 --> 02:20:50,397
Will shrink you till

2316
02:20:50,439 --> 02:20:54,567
You're under ground
and living down

2317
02:20:54,610 --> 02:21:00,114
But it's not going to stop

2318
02:21:01,658 --> 02:21:07,414
It's not going to stop

2319
02:21:09,458 --> 02:21:15,503
It's not going to stop

2320
02:21:15,545 --> 02:21:18,673
Till you wise up

2321
02:21:25,138 --> 02:21:28,765
Prepare a list for what you need

2322
02:21:28,808 --> 02:21:32,477
Before you sign away the deed

2323
02:21:32,520 --> 02:21:37,984
'Cause it's not going to stop

2324
02:21:39,777 --> 02:21:45,490
It's not going to stop

2325
02:21:47,493 --> 02:21:53,498
It's not going to stop

2326
02:21:53,540 --> 02:21:57,128
Till you wise up

2327
02:21:57,210 --> 02:22:01,131
No, it's not going to stop

2328
02:22:01,174 --> 02:22:04,841
Till you wise up

2329
02:22:04,882 --> 02:22:08,386
No, it's not going to stop

2330
02:22:08,427 --> 02:22:12,014
So just give up

2331
02:22:54,057 --> 02:22:56,431
You know, you know, you know.

2332
02:22:56,472 --> 02:22:59,308
Go, go, go.

2333
02:23:03,229 --> 02:23:06,316
Hello, dear.
I need a favor.

2334
02:23:21,497 --> 02:23:24,792
All right.
Back up, Max.

2335
02:23:24,834 --> 02:23:26,460
Back up, Miles.

2336
02:23:28,462 --> 02:23:31,341
Hello. You Frank?
Jack, right?

2337
02:23:31,341 --> 02:23:33,676
Are you Phil?

2338
02:23:33,676 --> 02:23:36,720
Tried to get in touch with you.
We got disconnected.

2339
02:23:36,763 --> 02:23:41,183
Stay in, Max!
Hey, come on! Please!

2340
02:23:41,226 --> 02:23:43,895
- I got the message.
- I couldn't find you.

2341
02:23:43,936 --> 02:23:46,185
Earl asked me, so I looked
through the address books.

2342
02:23:46,227 --> 02:23:48,729
There's no number.
There's nothing.

2343
02:23:50,190 --> 02:23:52,191
Is what's-her-name ...

2344
02:23:52,234 --> 02:23:55,361
Linda? No, she went out.
She's not here.

2345
02:23:55,404 --> 02:23:57,531
Hey, I'm sorry.

2346
02:23:57,573 --> 02:23:59,700
I don't know what to do here.

2347
02:23:59,740 --> 02:24:02,076
Your dad asked me
to get in touch with you ...

2348
02:24:02,119 --> 02:24:04,663
and I didn't have the number.

2349
02:24:04,704 --> 02:24:07,207
I called the number.
Want to come in?

2350
02:24:07,248 --> 02:24:09,584
- Yeah. Hey, Phil?
- Yeah?

2351
02:24:09,584 --> 02:24:12,962
I will drop-kick those fucking
dogs if they come near me.

2352
02:24:13,004 --> 02:24:14,755
All right.

2353
02:24:14,798 --> 02:24:18,426
Come on in.
This is Blake.

2354
02:24:18,468 --> 02:24:21,095
Clear them out.

2355
02:24:21,138 --> 02:24:23,307
Miles. Here we go.

2356
02:24:23,347 --> 02:24:24,765
All right, he's in here.

2357
02:24:24,765 --> 02:24:27,769
So we all go in here.

2358
02:24:27,769 --> 02:24:29,604
Want to go in?

2359
02:24:30,855 --> 02:24:35,065
No, I just stand here
a second, Phil.

2360
02:25:05,137 --> 02:25:06,305
Lady!

2361
02:25:29,075 --> 02:25:30,659
Hey, wake up.

2362
02:25:34,038 --> 02:25:35,622
What's wrong with you?

2363
02:26:09,949 --> 02:26:11,200
Here.

2364
02:26:24,334 --> 02:26:26,336
How do we do this, then?

2365
02:26:28,548 --> 02:26:31,134
Well, we just do it.

2366
02:26:31,175 --> 02:26:34,554
We do it.
We figure it out.

2367
02:26:34,595 --> 02:26:36,931
We do as we do, I guess.

2368
02:26:38,850 --> 02:26:40,602
Do you love me, Rose?

2369
02:26:41,685 --> 02:26:43,938
You are my handsome man.

2370
02:26:46,023 --> 02:26:47,900
I'm a bad person.

2371
02:26:50,904 --> 02:26:52,738
I mean ...

2372
02:26:52,781 --> 02:26:55,825
I'm telling you this now ...

2373
02:26:55,867 --> 02:26:59,287
because I want everything
to be clear and clean ...

2374
02:26:59,328 --> 02:27:03,165
and I want to apologize for me
and the stupid things I've done.

2375
02:27:06,082 --> 02:27:07,876
I've cheated on you.

2376
02:27:10,378 --> 02:27:14,966
I've cheated on you,
and ...it kills me ...

2377
02:27:15,007 --> 02:27:18,302
and the guilt
of what I've done ...

2378
02:27:18,344 --> 02:27:20,680
I don't want you
to think that ...

2379
02:27:22,765 --> 02:27:24,351
Maybe you knew.

2380
02:27:25,769 --> 02:27:27,521
I think maybe you've known.

2381
02:27:28,647 --> 02:27:32,359
So I hope this is not
just for me ...

2382
02:27:32,399 --> 02:27:36,279
for me to make myself feel
better about what I've done ...

2383
02:27:36,320 --> 02:27:39,324
but for you not to feel
like you're sitting there ...

2384
02:27:39,365 --> 02:27:41,325
like a jerk.

2385
02:27:41,368 --> 02:27:43,912
You're the good one.

2386
02:27:43,953 --> 02:27:45,454
You understand?

2387
02:27:46,622 --> 02:27:51,002
Did you ever go out
with someone and just lie ...

2388
02:27:51,043 --> 02:27:53,879
question after question?

2389
02:27:53,922 --> 02:27:56,547
Maybe you're trying to
make yourself look cool ...

2390
02:27:56,587 --> 02:27:59,006
or better than you are
or whatever ...

2391
02:27:59,049 --> 02:28:01,510
smarter, cooler ...

2392
02:28:01,510 --> 02:28:03,137
and you just ...

2393
02:28:05,055 --> 02:28:06,432
Not really lie ...

2394
02:28:06,472 --> 02:28:09,351
but maybe you just don't
say everything.

2395
02:28:09,351 --> 02:28:11,645
That's a natural thing.

2396
02:28:11,686 --> 02:28:16,023
You know, two people go out
on a date or something.

2397
02:28:16,023 --> 02:28:17,942
They want to impress people ...

2398
02:28:17,985 --> 02:28:19,903
the other person.

2399
02:28:19,944 --> 02:28:21,988
Or they're scared
they'll say something ...

2400
02:28:22,030 --> 02:28:25,032
that will make the other person
not like them.

2401
02:28:26,701 --> 02:28:28,578
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2402
02:28:29,871 --> 02:28:31,540
So you've done it?

2403
02:28:33,584 --> 02:28:35,835
I don't go out very often.

2404
02:28:35,878 --> 02:28:37,045
Why not?

2405
02:28:39,005 --> 02:28:44,011
I never found someone, really,
that I'd like to go out with.

2406
02:28:44,051 --> 02:28:47,011
I bet you say that
to all the girls.

2407
02:28:50,764 --> 02:28:53,641
Want to make a deal with me?

2408
02:28:55,269 --> 02:28:56,771
What I just said ...

2409
02:28:56,811 --> 02:29:00,483
people afraid to say things ...

2410
02:29:00,523 --> 02:29:04,779
no guts to say the things
that are real or something ...

2411
02:29:05,905 --> 02:29:07,698
to not do that.

2412
02:29:07,739 --> 02:29:12,745
To not do that
that maybe we've done before.

2413
02:29:15,790 --> 02:29:17,500
Let's make a deal.

2414
02:29:18,876 --> 02:29:23,379
I'll tell you everything,
and you tell me everything ...

2415
02:29:23,422 --> 02:29:26,634
and maybe we can get through
all the piss, shit, and lies ...

2416
02:29:26,634 --> 02:29:28,886
that kill other people.

2417
02:29:35,306 --> 02:29:37,265
"Piss and shit."

2418
02:29:37,350 --> 02:29:38,558
What?

2419
02:29:38,601 --> 02:29:42,604
You really use strong language.

2420
02:29:42,647 --> 02:29:43,815
I'm sorry.

2421
02:29:43,855 --> 02:29:47,485
No, it's fine.

2422
02:29:47,527 --> 02:29:50,695
I didn't mean − It seems vulgar
or something, I know.

2423
02:29:50,737 --> 02:29:52,156
- It's fine.
- I'm sorry.

2424
02:29:52,198 --> 02:29:53,532
It's nothing.
I'm sorry.

2425
02:29:53,532 --> 02:29:59,288
I'm gonna run to the bathroom
for a minute maybe, just ...

2426
02:31:37,172 --> 02:31:40,592
I'm going to go in.
Are the dogs in there?

2427
02:31:40,634 --> 02:31:42,843
Yeah, but they stay
by the window.

2428
02:31:42,886 --> 02:31:46,597
I want you to come in with me
and stay away from me.

2429
02:31:46,639 --> 02:31:48,390
I want you there
in case he needs anything ...

2430
02:31:48,433 --> 02:31:51,560
because I am not
going to help him.

2431
02:31:51,602 --> 02:31:55,190
And, Phil, I will drop-kick
the fucking dogs ...

2432
02:31:55,231 --> 02:31:56,941
if they come near me.

2433
02:32:24,382 --> 02:32:26,385
You don't look that bad.

2434
02:32:42,650 --> 02:32:44,361
You prick.

2435
02:32:50,283 --> 02:32:52,995
"Cocksucker." That's what you
used to like to say, right?

2436
02:32:53,036 --> 02:32:54,288
"Cocksucker."

2437
02:32:56,537 --> 02:32:58,581
But you are a cocksucker, Earl.

2438
02:33:00,165 --> 02:33:01,916
It hurts, doesn't it?

2439
02:33:05,045 --> 02:33:07,047
You in a lot of pain?

2440
02:33:09,216 --> 02:33:11,551
She was in a lot of pain.

2441
02:33:13,845 --> 02:33:17,515
Right to the end,
she was in a lot of pain.

2442
02:33:20,059 --> 02:33:22,313
I know because I was there.

2443
02:33:22,353 --> 02:33:24,690
You didn't like illness,
though, do you?

2444
02:33:34,115 --> 02:33:35,784
I was there.

2445
02:33:40,915 --> 02:33:44,126
She waited for your call.

2446
02:33:48,127 --> 02:33:49,754
For you to come.

2447
02:33:57,637 --> 02:34:01,014
I am not going to cry.

2448
02:34:01,057 --> 02:34:05,019
I am not going to cry for you!

2449
02:34:10,983 --> 02:34:14,236
You cocksucker,
I know you can hear me.

2450
02:34:14,278 --> 02:34:18,825
I want you to know
that I hate your fucking guts.

2451
02:34:18,865 --> 02:34:23,078
You can just fucking die,
you fuck.

2452
02:34:23,120 --> 02:34:26,123
And I hope it hurts.
I fucking hope it hurts.

2453
02:35:09,956 --> 02:35:12,250
Her resps are down to six.

2454
02:35:12,291 --> 02:35:14,753
Let's get the gurney over here.

2455
02:35:14,793 --> 02:35:16,796
Check that ego

2456
02:35:16,837 --> 02:35:18,840
Come off it,
I'm a prophet

2457
02:35:18,881 --> 02:35:20,049
The professor

2458
02:35:20,091 --> 02:35:21,509
I'm gonna teach you
'bout the worm

2459
02:35:21,550 --> 02:35:23,887
Who eventually turned
to catch wreck

2460
02:35:23,927 --> 02:35:26,302
With the neck
of a long-time oppressor

2461
02:35:26,343 --> 02:35:27,888
And he's runnin' from the devil

2462
02:35:27,970 --> 02:35:29,806
But the debt is always gainin'

2463
02:35:29,847 --> 02:35:31,515
And if he's worth bein' hurt

2464
02:35:31,558 --> 02:35:33,184
He's worth bringin' pain in

2465
02:35:53,746 --> 02:35:58,292
Do you feel better
now that you've said this?

2466
02:35:58,334 --> 02:35:59,960
I don't know.

2467
02:36:01,587 --> 02:36:04,424
Well, I'm not ...mad.

2468
02:36:08,677 --> 02:36:12,057
Well, I am, but I'm ...not.

2469
02:36:12,099 --> 02:36:13,308
You know?

2470
02:36:16,558 --> 02:36:18,935
I love you so much, Rose.

2471
02:36:18,977 --> 02:36:21,604
I'm not through
asking my questions.

2472
02:36:26,652 --> 02:36:28,569
Why doesn't Claudia ...

2473
02:36:29,737 --> 02:36:31,906
talk to you, Jimmy?

2474
02:36:33,492 --> 02:36:34,909
Why?

2475
02:36:35,952 --> 02:36:38,831
Because we've ...

2476
02:36:38,871 --> 02:36:41,458
We both don't know.
What do you mean?

2477
02:36:41,500 --> 02:36:43,835
No, I think you know.

2478
02:36:43,877 --> 02:36:45,129
Maybe ...

2479
02:36:47,004 --> 02:36:48,424
I don't.

2480
02:36:50,007 --> 02:36:52,511
Say it, Jimmy.

2481
02:37:01,060 --> 02:37:02,688
I wanted to do that.

2482
02:37:02,729 --> 02:37:03,897
Well ...

2483
02:37:03,939 --> 02:37:07,105
That felt good to do −
to do what I wanted.

2484
02:37:08,648 --> 02:37:11,402
Can I tell you something?

2485
02:37:11,443 --> 02:37:13,486
Yeah, of course.

2486
02:37:13,529 --> 02:37:17,199
I'm really nervous
that you're gonna hate me soon.

2487
02:37:17,240 --> 02:37:20,286
You're gonna find stuff out
about me and hate me.

2488
02:37:20,326 --> 02:37:22,495
No. Like what?
What do you mean?

2489
02:37:22,538 --> 02:37:26,751
You have so much,
so many good things ...

2490
02:37:26,791 --> 02:37:28,835
and you seem so together.

2491
02:37:28,878 --> 02:37:30,462
You're a police officer ...

2492
02:37:30,504 --> 02:37:34,424
straight and put together
without any problems.

2493
02:37:34,467 --> 02:37:37,093
- I lost my gun today.
- What?

2494
02:37:37,136 --> 02:37:38,929
I lost my gun today ...

2495
02:37:38,970 --> 02:37:41,974
and I'm the laughingstock
of a lot of people.

2496
02:37:42,015 --> 02:37:44,852
I wanted to tell you.
I wanted you to know.

2497
02:37:44,852 --> 02:37:46,896
It's on my mind.

2498
02:37:46,936 --> 02:37:48,980
It makes me look like a fool.

2499
02:37:49,022 --> 02:37:51,024
And I feel like a fool.

2500
02:37:54,111 --> 02:37:56,736
You asked that
we should say things ...

2501
02:37:56,778 --> 02:38:00,031
say what we're thinking
and not lie about things.

2502
02:38:00,073 --> 02:38:03,325
I can tell you
that I lost my gun today.

2503
02:38:03,367 --> 02:38:05,327
I'm not a good cop.

2504
02:38:05,411 --> 02:38:08,039
I'm looked down at,
and I know that ...

2505
02:38:08,081 --> 02:38:11,709
and I'm scared that once you
find out, you won't like me.

2506
02:38:15,129 --> 02:38:17,090
Jim, that was so great.

2507
02:38:17,130 --> 02:38:18,924
I'm sorry.

2508
02:38:18,966 --> 02:38:22,469
What you just said.

2509
02:38:24,763 --> 02:38:28,433
I haven't been on a date
since I was married, and ...

2510
02:38:28,476 --> 02:38:31,938
that was three years ago.

2511
02:38:31,938 --> 02:38:34,106
Whatever you want to tell me ...

2512
02:38:34,147 --> 02:38:37,110
whatever you think
might scare me won't.

2513
02:38:37,110 --> 02:38:39,194
I will listen to you.

2514
02:38:39,236 --> 02:38:41,948
I'll be a good listener
if that's what you want.

2515
02:38:41,988 --> 02:38:44,574
And I won't judge you.

2516
02:38:44,615 --> 02:38:47,282
I know I do that sometimes.
I won't.

2517
02:38:47,325 --> 02:38:50,745
And I can listen.

2518
02:38:50,828 --> 02:38:54,248
And you shouldn't be scared
of scaring me off ...

2519
02:38:54,332 --> 02:38:59,754
or whatever you think
that I think and on and on.

2520
02:38:59,796 --> 02:39:02,256
Just say it, whatever it is,
and I'll listen.

2521
02:39:02,298 --> 02:39:05,510
You don't know how fucking
stupid and crazy I am.

2522
02:39:05,551 --> 02:39:06,677
It's OK.

2523
02:39:06,718 --> 02:39:08,263
I got troubles, OK?

2524
02:39:08,304 --> 02:39:10,432
I'll take everything
at face value.

2525
02:39:10,472 --> 02:39:12,600
I started this, didn't I?
Fuck!

2526
02:39:12,641 --> 02:39:14,184
Whatever it is, just say it.

2527
02:39:14,227 --> 02:39:15,728
You'll see.

2528
02:39:15,770 --> 02:39:17,272
You want to kiss me?

2529
02:39:17,313 --> 02:39:18,772
Yes, I do.

2530
02:39:21,567 --> 02:39:24,654
Say it, Jimmy.

2531
02:39:26,948 --> 02:39:29,367
I think she thinks ...

2532
02:39:29,367 --> 02:39:31,995
that I may have molested her.

2533
02:39:33,913 --> 02:39:37,581
She thinks terrible things that
somehow got into her head ...

2534
02:39:37,621 --> 02:39:39,665
that I may have done.

2535
02:39:39,708 --> 02:39:43,920
She said that to me last time
when it was ...

2536
02:39:45,463 --> 02:39:48,174
Ten years ago
she walked out the door.

2537
02:39:48,216 --> 02:39:49,675
"You touched me wrong.
I know that."

2538
02:39:49,718 --> 02:39:57,266
Some crazy thought in her head.

2539
02:39:58,602 --> 02:40:00,436
Did you ever touch her?

2540
02:40:06,817 --> 02:40:08,153
I don't know.

2541
02:40:14,283 --> 02:40:16,327
I don't know.
I really don't.

2542
02:40:18,789 --> 02:40:20,998
But you can't say.

2543
02:40:23,251 --> 02:40:25,876
I don't know what I've done.

2544
02:40:25,917 --> 02:40:28,711
Yes, you do. You do!

2545
02:40:31,673 --> 02:40:33,674
But you won't say.

2546
02:40:33,717 --> 02:40:35,843
I don't know.

2547
02:40:35,886 --> 02:40:38,888
What? Please. Please.

2548
02:40:40,139 --> 02:40:43,559
You deserve to die alone
for what you've done!

2549
02:40:43,602 --> 02:40:45,521
I don't know what I've done.

2550
02:40:45,561 --> 02:40:47,730
Yes, you do!

2551
02:40:47,772 --> 02:40:50,817
If I said that I knew,
would you stay?

2552
02:40:51,902 --> 02:40:54,237
But I don't know what I've done.

2553
02:40:54,279 --> 02:40:57,532
You should know better!

2554
02:41:04,081 --> 02:41:07,959
Now that I've met you would you
object to never seeing me again?

2555
02:41:08,001 --> 02:41:09,628
What?

2556
02:41:09,670 --> 02:41:10,879
Just say no.

2557
02:41:10,921 --> 02:41:14,838
I won't say no.
Wait, Claudia.

2558
02:41:14,879 --> 02:41:16,799
Just let me go, Jimmy.

2559
02:41:16,841 --> 02:41:18,843
What is it?
Please, please.

2560
02:41:41,449 --> 02:41:43,450
Why didn't you call?

2561
02:41:59,632 --> 02:42:02,677
I fucking hate you.

2562
02:42:05,302 --> 02:42:09,890
God damn you, fucking asshole.

2563
02:42:13,852 --> 02:42:16,189
Oh, God, you fucking asshole.

2564
02:42:16,229 --> 02:42:18,816
Don't go away,
you fucking asshole.

2565
02:42:23,529 --> 02:42:28,784
Oh, God, don't go away,
you fucking asshole.

2566
02:42:45,218 --> 02:42:47,552
What am I doing?

2567
02:42:47,594 --> 02:42:50,932
What the fuck am I doing?

2568
02:45:10,938 --> 02:45:12,397
Oh, fuck.

2569
02:45:33,998 --> 02:45:37,002
What?

2570
02:45:40,213 --> 02:45:42,216
What are you doing, dummy?

2571
02:45:43,509 --> 02:45:45,176
Oh, brother.

2572
02:47:57,007 --> 02:48:00,219
There are frogs
falling from the sky.

2573
02:50:07,842 --> 02:50:10,176
Come on! Come on!

2574
02:50:28,650 --> 02:50:31,236
Claudia, it's Mom!
Open the door, honey!

2575
02:50:32,863 --> 02:50:35,407
Claudia, are you there?

2576
02:50:35,450 --> 02:50:38,076
Mom! Mom! Mom! Mommy!

2577
02:50:38,119 --> 02:50:39,662
All right. All right.

2578
02:50:39,745 --> 02:50:42,247
It's OK.
It's all right now.

2579
02:50:42,290 --> 02:50:46,334
It's OK.
It's gonna be all right.

2580
02:50:56,888 --> 02:50:59,097
This happens.

2581
02:50:59,139 --> 02:51:01,141
This is something that happens.

2582
02:52:25,887 --> 02:52:30,350
And there is the account
of the hanging of three men ...

2583
02:52:30,391 --> 02:52:31,934
and a scuba diver ...

2584
02:52:31,977 --> 02:52:34,021
and a suicide.

2585
02:52:43,280 --> 02:52:47,367
There are stories of
coincidence and chance ...

2586
02:52:47,408 --> 02:52:50,537
and intersections
and strange things told ...

2587
02:52:50,578 --> 02:52:53,457
and which is which
and who only knows?

2588
02:52:58,625 --> 02:52:59,877
And we generally say ...

2589
02:52:59,917 --> 02:53:03,629
"Well, if that was in a movie,
I wouldn't believe it."

2590
02:53:03,672 --> 02:53:06,674
Someone's so-and-so
met someone else's so-and-so ...

2591
02:53:06,717 --> 02:53:08,426
and so on.

2592
02:53:08,468 --> 02:53:11,638
And it is in the humble opinion
of this narrator ...

2593
02:53:11,680 --> 02:53:14,140
that strange things
happen all the time.

2594
02:53:14,183 --> 02:53:16,393
And so it goes, and so it goes.

2595
02:53:16,434 --> 02:53:18,353
And the book says ...

2596
02:53:18,395 --> 02:53:20,522
"We may be through
with the past ...

2597
02:53:20,564 --> 02:53:23,108
but the past
ain't through with us."

2598
02:53:27,487 --> 02:53:29,864
I'm sorry, Jack.

2599
02:53:29,864 --> 02:53:32,700
It's the hospital
calling about Linda.

2600
02:53:32,700 --> 02:53:33,826
Who?

2601
02:53:33,869 --> 02:53:36,120
Linda.
She's in the hospital.

2602
02:53:36,163 --> 02:53:39,958
I figured you should probably
talk to them since you're here.

2603
02:53:51,257 --> 02:53:54,512
Is she gonna be all right?

2604
02:53:58,808 --> 02:54:04,354
Could you please tell me
where you're located?

2605
02:54:21,996 --> 02:54:24,834
Are you with us, Linda? Good.

2606
02:54:24,875 --> 02:54:26,627
It is, Linda, isn't it?

2607
02:54:31,340 --> 02:54:34,300
Just relax. That's it.

2608
02:54:36,509 --> 02:54:37,968
You'll get through this.

2609
02:54:49,855 --> 02:54:51,106
Dad.

2610
02:54:59,114 --> 02:55:01,783
Dad, you need to be nicer to me.

2611
02:55:03,369 --> 02:55:05,120
Go to bed.

2612
02:55:06,956 --> 02:55:09,625
You have to be nicer to me, Dad.

2613
02:55:13,254 --> 02:55:14,755
Go to bed.

2614
02:55:22,721 --> 02:55:26,889
I know I did a stupid thing.

2615
02:55:26,931 --> 02:55:29,225
So stupid.

2616
02:55:29,266 --> 02:55:31,935
Getting braces.

2617
02:55:31,977 --> 02:55:33,228
I thought ...

2618
02:55:35,230 --> 02:55:37,233
I thought he would love me.

2619
02:55:37,274 --> 02:55:40,486
Getting ...braces.

2620
02:55:40,528 --> 02:55:41,737
For what?

2621
02:55:41,780 --> 02:55:45,157
For something I don't even ...

2622
02:55:47,869 --> 02:55:50,871
I don't know where
to put things, you know?

2623
02:55:54,459 --> 02:55:57,379
I really do have love to give.

2624
02:55:57,420 --> 02:56:00,090
I just don't know
where to put it.

2625
02:56:10,308 --> 02:56:14,061
A lot of people think this is
just a job that you go to.

2626
02:56:15,644 --> 02:56:19,022
Take a lunch hour ...
job's over.

2627
02:56:19,064 --> 02:56:20,315
Something like that.

2628
02:56:22,734 --> 02:56:24,778
But it's a 24-hour deal.

2629
02:56:27,322 --> 02:56:29,031
No two ways about it.

2630
02:56:30,533 --> 02:56:33,495
And what most people
don't see ...

2631
02:56:35,539 --> 02:56:39,209
is just how hard it is
to do the right thing.

2632
02:56:42,379 --> 02:56:44,463
People think if I make
a judgment call ...

2633
02:56:44,505 --> 02:56:47,509
that's a judgment on them,
but that is not what I do.

2634
02:56:49,468 --> 02:56:51,805
And that's not
what should be done.

2635
02:56:53,724 --> 02:56:56,559
I have to take everything ...

2636
02:56:56,601 --> 02:56:58,645
and play it as it lays.

2637
02:57:03,233 --> 02:57:05,190
Sometimes people
need a little help.

2638
02:57:05,231 --> 02:57:07,942
I got a buddy who's
supposed to be real good ...

2639
02:57:07,985 --> 02:57:09,486
at corrective oral surgery.

2640
02:57:14,157 --> 02:57:17,161
Sometimes people
need to be forgiven.

2641
02:57:23,709 --> 02:57:26,420
And sometimes
they need to go to jail.

2642
02:57:27,712 --> 02:57:30,757
Call me about that guy
with the teeth, OK?

2643
02:57:31,799 --> 02:57:35,137
And that is a very
tricky thing on my part ...

2644
02:57:36,555 --> 02:57:38,222
making that call.

2645
02:57:42,352 --> 02:57:45,522
I mean, the law is the law.

2646
02:57:45,564 --> 02:57:48,024
And heck if I'm gonna break it.

2647
02:57:55,695 --> 02:57:57,614
You can forgive someone.

2648
02:58:04,996 --> 02:58:06,582
Well, that's the tough part.

2649
02:58:12,962 --> 02:58:14,799
What can we forgive?

2650
02:58:26,394 --> 02:58:28,103
Tough part of the job.

2651
02:58:31,981 --> 02:58:34,317
Tough part of walking
down the street.

2652
02:59:31,914 --> 02:59:33,915
I just wanted to come here ...

2653
02:59:35,457 --> 02:59:37,834
to come here
and say something ...

2654
02:59:37,834 --> 02:59:40,920
say something important,
something that you said.

2655
02:59:42,422 --> 02:59:45,717
You said we should say things
and do things.

2656
02:59:45,759 --> 02:59:49,304
Not lie, not keep things back ...

2657
02:59:49,345 --> 02:59:51,681
these sorts of things
that tear people up.

2658
02:59:51,722 --> 02:59:54,516
Well, I'm gonna do that.

2659
02:59:54,558 --> 02:59:58,438
I'm gonna do what you said,
Claudia.

2660
02:59:58,479 --> 03:00:00,648
I can't let this go.

2661
03:00:03,692 --> 03:00:05,444
I can't let you go.

2662
03:00:10,450 --> 03:00:11,784
Now, you ...

2663
03:00:13,119 --> 03:00:15,914
You listen to me now.

2664
03:00:18,248 --> 03:00:20,084
You're a good person.

2665
03:00:22,754 --> 03:00:25,796
You're a good
and beautiful person ...

2666
03:00:25,836 --> 03:00:28,381
and I won't let you
walk out on me.

2667
03:00:30,592 --> 03:00:33,219
And I won't let you
say those things ...

2668
03:00:33,261 --> 03:00:37,139
those things about how stupid
you are and this and that.

2669
03:00:38,265 --> 03:00:40,102
I won't stand for that.

2670
03:00:42,813 --> 03:00:45,565
You want to be with me ...

2671
03:00:47,609 --> 03:00:50,779
then you be with me.

2672
03:00:52,531 --> 03:00:53,699
You see?
