was an Olympic bobsledder...

166
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:55,485
who tried to get your father
to switch sports.

167
00:10:55,554 --> 00:11:00,218
He had some theory about using
track sprinters to push the bobsled.

168
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:03,557
Some ridiculous thing like that.
Can you imagine,

169
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:06,496
a Jamaican bobsledder?

170
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,931
- And you sure this man,
he lives on the island?
- Oh, yes.

171
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,802
- Mr. Coolidge, thanks a lot.
- Good, Derice.

172
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:18,435
- Oh. Could I borrow this picture?
- Bring it back.

173
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,843
Yes. Thanks a lot,
Mr. Coolidge.

174
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:23,609
- Oh. Just one more thing.
- Hmm?

175
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,846
What's a bobsled?

176
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:30,651
That's a bobsled!

177
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:34,591
Oh! So a bobsled is
a pushcart with no wheels.

178
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,255
- That's what it looks like here.
- Let me see that.

179
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:45,434
All right. "The key elements
for a successful sled team...

180
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:49,998
are a steady driver and three strong
runners to push off down the ice."

181
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:53,341
Ice! Ice!

182
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:58,873
Well... it's kind of
a winter sport, you know.

183
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:03,115
- You mean winter as in ice?
- Maybe.

184
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:07,182
You mean winter as in igloos
and Eskimos and penguins and ice?

185
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:10,660
- Possibly.
- See ya.

186
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,528
- Where you goin'?
- I'm gonna take a hot bath.

187
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,726
I'm gettin' cold just thinkin'
about all this ice.

188
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:18,361
No, man! You're gonna be
part of my bobsled team.

189
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:20,371
What you need me for?

190
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:23,272
Who... is the best
pushcart driver...

191
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:26,106
- In all of Jamaica?
- You're lookin' at him!

192
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:29,113
- Then you're gonna do it?
- No!

193
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:31,342
Hey, man, you could be famous.

194
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:35,012
You could have your picture
on a Wheaties box.

195
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:38,887
But you said no, and that's all right
because I don't need ya.

196
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,587
Everybody is gonna want to be
on my bobsled team.

197
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:45,960
Look, star, let me tell you
a little somethin', all right?

198
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:49,489
When you need something from me, you
don't have to hand me a bunch of lines.

199
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:52,002
All you have to do is
look at me in the eye and say,

200
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:54,130
"Sanka, you are my best friend.

201
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:57,334
We've been through a whole heap together
and I really, really need you."

202
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:01,543
Sanka, you're right.

203
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:05,072
And you are my best friend. And we've
been through a whole lot together.

204
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:08,951
- Heap. Heap.
- Sorry, man. A whole heap together.

205
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:11,251
And I really, really need you.

206
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:14,622
- And I really, really need you.
- Forget it!

207
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:16,888
- But you just said if I said that, man...
- All right, all right,

208
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,896
all right.

209
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,898
All right, man.

210
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,230
[Sanka] So, let's talk
about this "billsled" team.

211
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:26,169
- [Derice] No. Bobsled team.
- Whoever.

212
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:29,935
[Sanka] Now about the Wheaties box.
I'm gonna be on it by myself, right?

213
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,273
No, man, you're gonna be
on it with me.

214
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:34,676
[Man On Radio] And down the stretch
they come! Tumbleweed is holding on...

215
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:37,113
- As Captain Video is still
running on the outside.
- Yes, Tumbleweed, yes!

216
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,651
...is dropping back
as Tumbleweed holds the rail.
- Come on! That's it!

217
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:41,948
Good Tumbleweed!
Good Tumbleweed!

218
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:45,479
- Tumbleweed is slowing!
- No, Tumbleweed, no! Bad Tumbleweed!

219
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:49,016
- What are you doin'?
- Tumbleweed can't hold it as he
gets pinned against the rail.

220
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:52,689
Don't do that!
Let him out!

221
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:54,790
- Tumbleweed is running gamely,
but Captain Video...
- Don't! I need this one!

222
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,801
- Is just a little bit too strong.
- Please! Come on!

223
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:58,996
- Here they come! Yes!
- No!

224
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:01,335
Tumbleweed can't hold it
as Captain Video takes charge.

225
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:04,774
- And it's Brewster finishing
in second. Susan's Pride...
- What?

226
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,210
finishes third and Tumbleweed
is nowhere in sight.

227
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,511
But my, oh, my, the odds-on
favorite showed his true colors
with that late stretch run.

228
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:14,417
- Uh-huh.
- Tumbleweed held on momentarily,
but realistically,

229
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:17,148
only a fool would put
their money on Tumbleweed.

230
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:21,023
- That horse had no chance whatsoev...
- Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh!

231
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:23,823
Uh-huh! Uh-huh!

232
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:26,490
That guy won two gold medals?

233
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:32,596
I think so.

234
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:36,607
[Sighs]

235
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:40,702
That's Tumbleweed gone.
Okay, next race.

236
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:47,482
Excuse, me.
Are you Mr. Irving Blitzer?

237
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,714
Well, that depends
on who's asking.

238
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:53,588
My name is Derice Bannock.
This is my teammate, Sanka Coffie.

239
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,820
Greetings, sled god.

240
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,022
We were just wondering
if you'd be interested...

241
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:02,227
in coaching the first
Jamaican bobsled team.

242
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:05,566
Derice, remember the radio?
Radio?

243
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:08,664
Stick. Shooting
with the stick. Let's go!

244
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,107
Let's go, Derice!

245
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:26,221
Come on, coach.

246
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:29,557
Just help me get started.

247
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:31,596
[Derice Groans]

248
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,230
- Oh!
- Greetings, sled god.

249
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:46,404
- Sorry to bother you, but you're
the only one who can help us.
- Get out! Get out!

250
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:50,414
[Sighs, Groans]

251
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:52,416
[Toilet Flushing]

252
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:58,018
- Go away.
- Okay.

253
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,354
Nice to meet you!

254
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:03,759
- Maybe today is a bad day.
- Yeah.

255
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:08,732
I'll come back tomorrow.
And the next day. And the next day.

256
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:12,237
- No! Look, whatever your name is...
- Derice.

257
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:15,796
All right, Derice. Let me lay out
some difficulties for you.

258
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:20,470
Snow. You don't have any.
It's 900 degrees out there.

259
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:24,346
Time. You don't have any.
The Olympics are in three months.

260
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,977
And me. You don't have me.

261
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:31,454
As far as I'm concerned, the sport
of bobsledding no longer exists.

262
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:34,048
I don't want to do it,
I don't want to coach it,

263
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:37,391
and most of all,
and I mean most of all,

264
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:41,729
I don't want to be within
2,000 miles of anyone who does.

265
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,734
Now, did you follow all that?

266
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:46,362
Then how come you still have
that poster on the wall?

267
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:52,307
Is that what's bothering you?

268
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:59,417
There. Is that better?
Are you happy?

269
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:10,752
Like I said...
my name is Derice Bannock.

270
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:13,821
I'm Ben Bannock's son.

271
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:20,927
I haven't seen this picture
in 20 years.

272
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:25,033
Huh. Would you look at me then?

273
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:28,045
Whoo. Would you look at me now.

274
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:32,015
Please, Mr. Blitzer,
just give me a chance.

275
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:35,349
If I don't have what it takes,
we'll forget the whole thing.

276
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,946
Believe me, kid,
you do not have what it takes.

277
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:40,821
- But you thought my father did.
- Your father was one of...

278
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:44,226
the toughest competitors I ever saw.

279
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:47,561
He ran the 100 meters in ten-flat.

280
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:50,693
Well, I run it in nine-nine.

281
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:56,832
Come on. Coach me.

282
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:02,176
Sorry.
You're a couple decades late.

283
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:05,375
Oh, I see. It might be easy
for you to walk away from me,

284
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:08,352
Mr. Blitzer, but you can't
walk away from this:

285
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,547
Twenty years ago
you came down here to see...

286
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:13,716
if you could make a Jamaican sprinter
into a bobsledder,

287
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:16,192
and you never got that chance.

288
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:20,357
Look at me, Mr. Blitzer.
I'm your chance.

289
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,525
Take it.

290
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:28,939
[Exhaling]

291
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,168
- [Crowd Chattering]
- " [Reggae]

292
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:36,045
All right.
Everyone quiet down.

293
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:40,017
Nice group here.
Now, for two of you lucky people,

294
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:43,782
our trip to the Olympics
starts right now.

295
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:49,490
And I want to introduce you...
to Mr. Irving Blitzer...

296
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:53,019
who's going to be
our expert bobsled coach.

297
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,068
Sanka. Hit it, man.

298
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:01,630
You're on the air, sled god.

299
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:04,972
Gentlemen, a bobsled
is a simple thing.

300
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:06,977
[Man]
Yeah, so's a toilet!

301
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:09,605
[Crowd Laughing]

302
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:13,674
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Basically, what you're looking to do...

303
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:19,122
is get your sorry rear ends from the top
of an icy chute to the bottom.

304
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:22,683
You're ziggin', you're zaggin'.

305
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:26,788
It's the biggest, coldest
roller coaster you've ever been on.

306
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,559
Ice.

307
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,999
Oooh. Ooh.
[Chuckles]

308
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:39,442
[Irv]
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

309
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,412
I almost forgot, uh...

310
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:45,644
One minor drawback
to this delightful winter sport...

311
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:48,311
is the high-speed crash.

312
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:50,651
That hurt. Ah.

313
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:55,182
Always remember, your bones
will not break in a bobsled.

314
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,285
No, no. They shatter.

315
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:02,366
Eee!

316
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:08,237
So... who wants in?

317
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:25,953
Look. Baldy's here.

318
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:28,049
Glad you could make it, man.

319
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:32,995
- Don't touch me!
- No problem.

320
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:36,228
- So what's your name?
- Yul Brenner.

321
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,896
Well, it's good to have you
as a teammate, Brenner.

322
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:45,808
Let's get one thing straight,
Bannock.

323
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:50,541
We may be on the same team,
but I am no one's teammate.

324
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:53,210
- Long as you come here to bobsled...
- Hey, listen, man,

325
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:55,515
the only reason why I come here...

326
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:59,182
is to get off
of this stinkin' island.

327
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:04,321
If I have to take one of those bobsleds
to do it, then all right.

328
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:07,331
- No problem.
- [Irv] Ah, yes.

329
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:11,096
Yes, I have a problem. There's
no such thing as a three-man sled.

330
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:14,263
You're one Jamaican short.

331
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:17,433
Hey.

332
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:20,740
The meeting start yet?
Uh-oh.

333
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:24,111
You! I'll kill you.

334
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:26,309
- [Derice] Wait! Hold on!
- College boy, I'll kill you!

335
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:29,013
[Sanka] Hey, think, man, think!
Easy! Whoa! Down, boy!

336
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:31,920
[Men Shouting, Chair Clattering]

337
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,426
Kill him
and we don't have a team.

338
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:37,860
I'm not ridin'
in the same sled as that.

339
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:40,898
He tripped me too, you know.
But in case you haven't noticed,

340
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,366
there's no one else here.

341
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:46,336
- You're crowdin' me, slinky head.
- [Chuckling]

342
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:48,339
Slinky head.
That's a good one.

343
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,875
- What are you laughing about?
- Nothing.

344
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:55,345
If it wasn't for you, rich boy,
I'd be in the Olympics right now.

345
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:58,008
I don't know what you all are arguing
about 'cause Derice was gonna...

346
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:01,519
- Beat both of your butts anyway.
- What are you talkin' about?

347
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:04,555
- How 'bout I beat your butt right now?
- How 'bout I draw a line...

348
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,989
down the middle of your head
so it looks like a butt?

349
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:08,993
[Chuckling]

350
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:15,696
Forget it, man, I'm gone.

351
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:18,463
[Derice]
Fine. Stay here on the island.

352
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:21,700
We're going to Canada.

353
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:29,476
All right. I'll do it.

354
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:33,348
But you better tell
this mama's boy...

355
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:35,784
to stay the hell away from me.

356
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,254
You understand?

357
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:41,690
No problem.

358
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,992
Hey, Irv.
Say hello to the first...

359
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:48,760
Jamaican bobsled team.

360
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:58,203
Oh, goody.

361
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:02,645
Gentlemen,
this... is a bobsled.

362
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,342
Sort of.

363
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:08,818
- All right, here's what
we're gonna do. Yul...
- Don't touch me.

364
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:12,823
Of course. Sorry. You're
gonna be the second middleman.

365
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:16,987
You're strong, you're fast
and you're gonna love that seat.

366
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,121
Junior,
you're the first middleman.

367
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:22,963
You're quick, you're sharp.
Hop in. Sanka.

368
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:26,003
- I know. I'm the driver, right?
- No, you're the brakeman.

369
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:30,440
- No, no, I'm the driver.
- No, you're not. You're the brakeman.

370
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:33,842
- I'm the driver.
- You're not. You're the brakeman.

371
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,880
You don't understand.
I am Sanka Coffie.

372
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:38,541
I'm the best pushcart driver
in all of Jamaica.

373
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:42,178
I must drive.
Do you dig where I'm coming from?

374
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,188
- Yeah, I dig where you're coming from.
- Good.

375
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:47,350
Now dig where I'm coming from.
I'm coming from two gold medals.

376
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,918
I'm coming from nine world records
in both the two and four-man events.

377
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:53,692
I'm coming from ten years
of intense competition...

378
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:56,165
with the best athletes
in the world.

379
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:58,464
That's a hell of a place
to be comin' from.

380
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:02,098
You see, Sanka, the driver
has to work harder than anyone.

381
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:04,734
He's the first to show up
and the last to leave.

382
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,040
When his teammates
are all out drinkin' beer,

383
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,910
he's up in his room
studying pictures of turns.

384
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:14,611
You see, a driver must remain
focused 100% at all times.

385
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:18,747
Not only is he responsible for knowing
every inch of every course he races,

386
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:22,351
he's also responsible for the lives
of the other three people in his sled.

387
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:26,463
Now, do you want
that responsibility?

388
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:28,624
I say we make Derice
the driver.

389
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,136
So do l, Sanka. So do I.

390
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:35,731
[Sighs]

391
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:39,399
Oh. The back is nice.

392
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:43,073
[Junior]
All right, Father, listen here.

393
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:47,983
Ya see, I've made up my mind.
I am going to be a bobsledder.

394
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:51,250
That's right. A bobsledder.

395
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:54,486
- [Dog Barks, Whines]
- Oh, really?

396
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,790
Well, I'm sorry
you feel that way.

397
00:24:57,863 --> 00:25:03,301
Fine. Cut off my allowance,
because you see, Father,

398
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:07,771
a man has got to do
what a man has got to do.

399
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,603
[Car Horn Honking]

400
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:22,176
- Just who I want to see.
- M-M-Me?

401
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:26,122
- You know where I just came from?
- W-Where?

402
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:31,356
I got you a job.
With Webster, Webster and Cohen,

403
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:33,795
the biggest brokerage house in Miami.

404
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:36,459
Oh, right.
Webster, Webster and Cohen.

405
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:40,528
[Chuckling] That's right.
And you start end of the month.

406
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:45,971
- Yes, but I thought that I would...
- Look.

407
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:50,003
We went along with
this track nonsense long enough.

408
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:54,211
And we agreed that it's time
to get on with your real future.

409
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:56,584
Right?

410
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:59,556
- I know...
- Right?

411
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:02,320
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

412
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,420
[Chuckles]

413
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:09,228
I'm gonna tell your mother.
[Chuckling]

414
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:23,638
- I guess we sure told him.
- [Whining]

415
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:27,912
Winning a bobsled race is about
one thing: the push start.

416
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:32,685
Now I know you dainty little
track stars think you're fast.

417
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:37,990
Well, heh, let's see how fast you are
when you push a 600-pound sled.

418
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:42,500
Now a respectable start time
is 5.7 seconds.

419
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:45,593
If you speed demons can't
whip off an even six-flat,

420
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:48,468
then you have a better chance of
becoming a barbershop quartet.

421
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,633
[Groaning]

422
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:52,904
Derice, come on! Hey!

423
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:57,881
- Junior, get in. Never mind.
- Ow!

424
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,110
- [Laughing]
- Come on, fellas,
move it back. Let's go!

425
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:04,952
' Here on this mountain top
oh-oh '

426

- 14.3. No good.
- ' I've got some wild, wild life '

427
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:10,855
- 13.5. 11.7.
- ' I've got some bills to pay, oh-oh '

428
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:13,659
This is what it's all about.
This is where you win or lose the race.

429
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:16,360
Right here in the push start.
This is where you're gonna practice,

430
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:18,902
right here, right here in a Volkswagen,
you're gonna practice.

431
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,564
- [Yelling]
- No! Junior, quit falling down.

432
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,098
Come on, hustle!
Catch up to them. There you go.

433
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:28,111
Whoa. No! Do it again.

434
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:32,548
[Sanka] Whoa, whoa. Stop, Derice!
Stop! Wait for me! Wait!

435
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:35,450
I'm in! Stop!
Slow down!

436
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,613
[Yelling, Crashing]

437
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:40,749
Great. Very good.
Try it again.

438
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:46,021
If I've said it once,
I've said it 46 times:

439
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:49,658
Cold weather endurance is vital
to building a successful sled team.

440
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:55,539
Cold enough?
[Chuckling]

441
00:27:57,442 --> 00:28:02,038
One, two, three!

442
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:05,480
[All]
Aaaah!

- [Sanka] Go! Go! Go!

444
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:19,862
- ' Here on this mountain top '
- [Sanka] Whoa! Slow down!

445
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:22,422
- ' Oh-oh "
- [Derice] Sanka, hit the brakes, man!

446
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,025
- I can't! It's stuck!
- [Derice] Hold on!

447
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:26,968
Look out!

448
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:31,475

- Sanka, you dead?
- [Groaning]

452
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:50,187
Yeah, man.

453
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:54,493
[Man] What have you done to the
police unit? I should arrest you.

454
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:57,967
- [Man #2] Who owns this thing?
- We do, sir.

455
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:01,904
- And who are you?
- The Jamaican bobsled team, sir.

I wasn't born yesterday.

5.9! 5.9! You did it!
You did it! 5.9!

459
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:17,277
We did it! We did it! 5.9!
Get outta the way! Get outta the way!

460
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:19,380
5.9, guys! What?

461
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:22,426
- Who are you?
- I'm their coach. You guys okay?

462
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:25,292
- Yeah, man.
- [Irv] How's the sled?

463
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:27,297
Sled's okay?
Well, it's in the wrong place.

464
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:30,266
Get it back to the top of the hill!
Let's move it right now, you slackers!

465
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:34,328
- Move it! Let's hustle!
Come on, you guys, move it!
- [Team Groaning]

466
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:35,838
[Thunder Rumbling]

467
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:39,172
[Irv] I'm not asking
for a winter sports program.

468
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:43,772
All I need is a lousy 20 grand so I
can get us to the Olympics. That's all.

469
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:46,749
[Coolidge] How in God's name
are you going to get to the Olympics?

470
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:49,343
These boys have never even
seen a sled race before.

471
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:53,254
Mr. Coolidge, I have been looking
at sledders since I was 12 years old.

472
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:57,351
If I say these kids
can make it to the Olympics,
they can make it to the Olympics.

473
00:29:57,428 --> 00:30:00,920
Okay. Well, I'll
tell you what we'll do.

474
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:03,297
Practice down here
with the boys a bit more,

475
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:06,098
and when you're a little further along,
I'll come along and see you...

476
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:10,608
- No! No, no!
- Now just a minute, Mr. Blitzer!

477
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:13,166
This country enjoys
a fine athletic tradition.

478
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:15,576
And if you think I'm gonna give you
the little money we have...

479
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:19,174
so that you can parade us around
in front of the world like a freak show,

480
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,548
you've got another thing coming.

481
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:24,417
It's bad enough how you
embarrassed your own country.

482
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,980
I'm certainly not gonna
allow you to embarrass ours.

483
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:32,793
No go, kid.

484
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:35,196
That's okay, coach.
We'll get the money.

485
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:37,928
Do the words "give up"

00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:31,082
For your first run,
I'm just gonna nudge you off.

647
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:34,215
Okay, everybody in. Let's go,
let's go. Come on, come on.

648
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,321
- [Yul] Don't touch me.
- Hey, baldy, get off my foot.

649
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:40,329
- Don't touch me!
- Here we go. Come on.

650
00:46:40,397 --> 00:46:45,164
Hey, Blitzer. Why don't you put
some training wheels on that sled?

651
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:49,103
- [Crowd Laughing]
- That's funny. Ha-ha. Very funny.

652
00:46:49,173 --> 00:46:53,803
- You want to kiss my egg?
- I'm not kissin' no egg.

653
00:46:53,877 --> 00:46:56,311
- Suit yourself.
- [Irv] Listen up, fellas.

654
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:59,440
- I don't want you to worry
about lookin' good out there.
- Ah, Blitzy.

655
00:46:59,516 --> 00:47:03,452
You're going to tuck them in too?

656
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,455
Hey. Seemin' to you
like nobody likes us?

657
00:47:06,523 --> 00:47:10,789
We're different. People
always afraid of what's different.

658
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:13,193
Hey, Jamaica!

659
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:16,391
Watch out for number 12 turn.
It's scary, ja?

660
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:17,899
Oooh!

661
00:47:17,968 --> 00:47:20,129
What's his problem?

662
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:23,332
He's Josef Grool. He's one
of the best drivers in the world.

663
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:26,274
Yeah, he's one of the biggest
assholes in the world too.

664
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:30,404
Don't listen to him; you listen to me.
Derice, right here. You got it?

665
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,610
Remember, keep your hands soft
and your mind clear.

666
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:38,678
- High in, low out. What is it?
- High in, low out.

667
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:41,781
All right, put your helmets on,
everybody. Let's go.

668
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,884
Here we go, come on.
Helmets on.

669
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:48,364
- Hey, coach?
- Yeah.

670
00:47:48,432 --> 00:47:50,627
I cannot get my helmet on.

671
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:53,499
- Thanks, coach.
- That's what I'm here for.

672
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:57,165
- Oh, coach? L-I gotta go. You know.
- Yeah?

673
00:47:57,241 --> 00:47:58,833
- Hold it!
- Hold it?

674
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:01,935
- Hold it! Yeah, hold it!
- Hold it?

675
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:05,641
B-But, coach, l, I can't hold it.
We're not bobsledding yet.

676
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:09,812
- Oh, yes, we are.
- Coach! Coach!

677
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:16,886
Coach! Coach!

678
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:23,259
[P.A.]
On the track.

679
00:48:26,803 --> 00:48:30,637
[Sanka]
Coach! Aaaaah!

680
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:36,310
[Sanka]
Aaaaah!

681
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:39,372
Slow down! Oh!
Slow down! Slow down!

682
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:43,681
Oh, my God! Oh! Oh, Derice!
Oh, Derice! I hate you!

683
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:48,521
I hate you!
I hate you! Ohhhh!

684
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:52,221
[Sanka Yelling]

685
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:56,892
[Crashing]

686
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:03,367
[Derice]
Sanka, you dead?

687
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,102
Yeah, man.

688
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:10,237
Well, you can pee now.

689
00:49:10,314 --> 00:49:12,509
Oh, too late.

690
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:17,076
This is embarrassing.

691
00:49:20,824 --> 00:49:22,257
[Coughing]

692
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:25,727
[Yul] Man, shut down
that hot plate, fool.

693
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:28,094
Those bananas are stinkin'
like a dead dog.

694
00:49:28,165 --> 00:49:32,295
Back off, back off, you eight ball!
This is my mama's secret recipe.

695
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:36,601
And I hope you don't mind keepin' quiet
while I catch up on my reading.

696
00:49:36,673 --> 00:49:39,801
What are you talkin' about, readin'?
This is a children's book.

697
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:42,367
- Oh, is that so?
- Yes, that's so.

698
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:45,882
If that's a children's book, that mean's
it's too advanced for the likes of you.

699
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:50,784
What are you trying to say? That I'm
not smarter than a little child?

700
00:49:50,854 --> 00:49:54,312
No. What I am saying to you is that you
are the kind of club-totin'...

701
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:56,951
raw meat-eatin',
me-Tarzan-you-Janein',

702
00:49:57,027 --> 00:49:59,825
big, bald bubblehead
that can only count to ten...

703
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:01,921
if he's barefoot
or wearing sandals.

704
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:04,263
Say whatever it is
that you want.

705
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:08,464
Because you're just like
every other fool on the island.

706
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:14,907
You're going nowhere, Sanka,
and you're thrilled to death about it.

707
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:19,306
But you see me?
You see me?

708
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:23,752
I'm different
'cause I know exactly...

709
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:25,947
where I'm going.

710
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:28,389
And after l, Yul Brenner,

711
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:31,723
win the Olympics
and become famous,

712
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:34,889
I'm gonna leave the island...

713
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:39,334
and live right down there.

714
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:42,839
[Laughing]

715
00:50:42,906 --> 00:50:44,840
What are you laughing about?

716
00:50:44,908 --> 00:50:47,968
- What are you laughing about?
- That's Buckingham Palace.

717
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:53,506
You plan on livin' there,
you're gonna have to marry the Queen.

718
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:56,711
Yul, that's where
the Queen of England lives.

719
00:51:01,658 --> 00:51:05,822
[Sanka] Face it, Yul Brenner.
You can start callin' yourself Madonna,

720
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:10,697
but you're still gonna
end up in an outhouse shanty
like every other dockworking nobody.

721
00:51:10,767 --> 00:51:14,294
- Says who?
- Says me, rich boy.
What you know about it?

722
00:51:14,371 --> 00:51:17,397
Well, I know my father
started off in a one-room hut.

723
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:19,965
Now, he lives in one of
the biggest homes in Kingston.

724
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:23,672
- Well, he ain't your father.
- He doesn't have to be.

725
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:28,241
All he has to do is know what he wants
and work hard for it.

726
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:31,685
And if he wants it bad enough,
he'll get it.

727
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:35,714
Look, believe me, Sanka,

728
00:51:35,792 --> 00:51:39,558
the more Yul Brenners we got
makin' it in this world,

729
00:51:39,629 --> 00:51:41,859
the better off this world would be.

730
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:45,891
Especially for Jamaicans.

731
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:04,778
Go ahead, Yul Brenner.
You go get your palace.

732
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:18,366
[Yelling]

733
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:20,426
Move, move!

734
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:22,438
[P.A.]
On the track.

735
00:52:27,944 --> 00:52:30,640
What do you have in there,
a baby?

736
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:37,252
- I can't believe you're still cold, man.
- Cold?

737
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,653
I'm freezin' my royal,
Rastafarian nay-nays off!

738
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:43,090
All right, we're up.
Let's go, guys. This is it.

739
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,094
Gimme that thing.

740
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:48,131
Okay. Now this is
our first real push start...

741
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:50,496
but don't worry about it, okay?

742
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:53,092
l-lt's no different
than what we practiced.
We've done it a hundred times.

743
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:56,469
Derice, right here.
Okay, get your helmets on.

744
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:58,474
- Coach.
- Okay, okay.

745
00:52:58,542 --> 00:53:00,976
- Thanks, coach.
- All right.
Let's go, Derice. It's yours.

746
00:53:01,044 --> 00:53:04,138
- Ridiculous. What's he doing?
- [Irv] Ready!

747
00:53:04,214 --> 00:53:09,481
One, two, three.

748
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:11,646
- [Yelling]
- Go, go, go, go!

749
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:14,519
- [Derice] Hold on! Wait!
- Now!

750
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:16,525
- Now! Now!
- Whoa! Look out!

751
00:53:16,593 --> 00:53:18,527
- Now.
- [Sanka Yelling]

752
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:44,646
[Speaking German]

753
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:52,990
Those guys are pretty good,
aren't they?

754
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:56,191
Good? They're the best.

755
00:53:56,266 --> 00:54:00,430
- So you guys been having
a little trouble out there, huh?
- Ah, we'll be fine.

756
00:54:00,503 --> 00:54:04,940
I sure hope so. It'd be a real shame
to waste all that talent.

757
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:08,375
I'm not worried.
And we have a good coach.

758
00:54:08,445 --> 00:54:10,379
[Laughs]

759
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:13,678
Kid, I hate to say it,
but you gotta wake up.

760
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,945
Coach Blitzer's
what's killin' ya.

761
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:19,386
He's been useless
since the day he was busted.

762
00:54:19,456 --> 00:54:23,017
- What you mean, "busted"?
- The '72 Games.

763
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:25,653
The guy hid weights in the front
of the sled to make it go faster.

764
00:54:28,198 --> 00:54:31,861
So what?
It's no big deal.

765
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:36,099
Having your gold medals taken away
for cheating is a big deal.

766
00:54:37,807 --> 00:54:40,708
Derice, let's go.
We've got a meeting.

767
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:56,425
Givin' my kid
a few pointers, Larry?

768
00:54:56,493 --> 00:54:59,690
Your kid's gonna need
all the help he can get.

769
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:06,401
Coach.

770
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:11,063
[Knocking]

771
00:55:12,676 --> 00:55:15,338
Maid service, sir.
Would you like your bed turned down?

772
00:55:15,412 --> 00:55:18,245
Mint? Perhaps I could
dust your head.

773
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:22,615
Whatever's wrong with you...
is no little thing.

774
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:28,246
Hurry up, man. I have a dead grandmother
that moves faster than you.

775
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:31,419
- Wait, wait.
- [Knocking]

776
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:34,930
What that fool want now?

777
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:37,990
- What?
- Sorry.

778
00:55:45,141 --> 00:55:47,473
- What do you have there, man?
- A telegram.

779
00:55:47,544 --> 00:55:50,479
I know it's a telegram.
What's it say?

780
00:55:54,384 --> 00:55:56,852
From my father.

781
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:01,619
He says I have to
come home right now.

782
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:03,625
[Sighs]

783
00:56:10,433 --> 00:56:13,027
' Workin' '

784
00:56:13,103 --> 00:56:16,971
' Workin' from payday
to payday '

785
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:21,500
' Every time payday comes
you know I'm down to my last '

786
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:26,013
' Well, I'm dreamin' '

787
00:56:26,082 --> 00:56:29,313
' Dreamin' of you all day '

788
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:35,052
' When the working's done we're
gonna love that night away '

789
00:56:36,626 --> 00:56:40,289
' 'Cause we're goin' nowhere
and we're gettin' there fast '

790
00:56:40,363 --> 00:56:42,661
' When we finally make it
we can both look back '

791
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:45,132
' On these hard times '

792
00:56:45,201 --> 00:56:47,499
' Just for a laugh '

793
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,834
- Hi.
- Howdy, partner.

794
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:53,137
' 'Cause when you got love you
don't need too much money '

795
00:56:53,209 --> 00:56:56,007
' I'm in love with you
and don't you know, honey '

796
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:59,411
' We're goin' nowhere '

797
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:03,816
- ' And we're gettin' there fast '
- You've worked too hard and too long.

798
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:06,947
And let me tell you
somethin' else, Junior Bevil.

799
00:57:07,023 --> 00:57:11,517
If it wasn't for you,
we wouldn't be here right now.

800
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:14,256
Wait.
But you don't understand.

801
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:16,457
He is really mad.

802
00:57:16,533 --> 00:57:19,001
I mean, you don't know him
like I do, you know.

803
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:22,265
[Sighs] I think I better
just do what he wants...

804
00:57:22,338 --> 00:57:24,272
and go back home.

805
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:28,936
And forget about your teammates?
Blood fire!

806
00:57:29,012 --> 00:57:32,880
The man, you act like he's

Tallulah.

970
01:08:55,898 --> 01:08:59,698
Sounds like a two-dollar hooker.
How you come up with that?

971

Hey, you idiot,
that's my mother's name.

- It's a pretty name.
- Tallulah. I like that.

So, what's it gonna be, star?

974
01:09:08,944 --> 01:09:11,845
What are the people gonna be screamin'
when Jamaica takes the hill?

975
01:09:11,914 --> 01:09:16,146
I say we call it
"Cool runnings."

- I like it.

- It's very strong.
- Nice. Very nice.

978
01:09:20,623 --> 01:09:23,490
Uh, what exactly does it mean?

979
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:26,960
"Cool runnings" means
"Peace be the journey."

980
01:09:27,029 --> 01:09:28,963
[Together]
Peace be the journey.

981

Excuse me, Irv.
I've nothing to say to you.

991
01:10:10,573 --> 01:10:14,737
Yes, you do. I want to know
why you disqualified my guys.

992
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:18,906
As you were told, your team must
compete in an international race
to qualify for the Olympics.

993
01:10:18,981 --> 01:10:23,384
But in an Olympic year, the qualifiers
count as an international race.

994
01:10:23,452 --> 01:10:26,285
That may have been true
in past Olympic years,

995
01:10:26,355 --> 01:10:29,813
but this year the Alliance
decided to change its policy.

996
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:32,861
Oh, please.
Change its policy?

997
01:10:32,928 --> 01:10:37,058
The Alliance has the right to do
whatever they feel is in the best
interest of the sport.

998
01:10:37,132 --> 01:10:41,466
We must also be concerned about
the potential for embarrassment.

999
01:10:41,537 --> 01:10:43,471
Oh, forgive me.

1000
01:10:43,539 --> 01:10:47,407
I didn't realize that four black guys
in a bobsled could make you blush.

1001

I think we've heard enough.

1002
01:10:50,179 --> 01:10:53,410
Come on, Kurt. What you're doin'
is wrong and you know it.

1003
01:10:53,482 --> 01:10:57,612
Now, if this is about you and me,
then let's get it straight right now.

1004
01:10:57,686 --> 01:11:02,623
All right, 16 years ago,
I made the biggest mistake of my life.

1005
01:11:02,691 --> 01:11:06,457
I cheated. I was stupid.

1006
01:11:06,528 --> 01:11:09,895
I embarrassed myself,
my family,

1007

and my coach.

1008

If it's revenge you want,
take it.

1009
01:11:18,841 --> 01:11:21,833
Go ahead.
Disqualify me, banish me.

1010
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:24,003
Do whatever you want,
but do it to me.

1011
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:27,879
It was me who let you down, Kurt.
It wasn't my guys.

1012
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:30,282
They've done everything
you've asked of them.

1013
01:11:30,352 --> 01:11:33,844
And they did it with all of you
laughing in their face.

1014
01:11:33,922 --> 01:11:38,382
Hell, it doesn't matter
if they come in first or 50th.

1015
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:41,827
Those guys have earned the right
to represent their country.

1016
01:11:41,897 --> 01:11:45,492
They've earned the right
to march into that stadium...

1017
01:11:45,567 --> 01:11:47,501
and wave their nation's flag.

1018
01:11:47,569 --> 01:11:52,097
That's the single greatest honor
an athlete could ever have.

1019
01:11:54,043 --> 01:11:57,410
That's what the Olympics
are about.

1020
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:02,344
Sixteen years ago,
I forgot that.

1021

- Oh, it's the Alliance. God.

1028

What did they say?

1029
01:12:47,329 --> 01:12:49,593

Their flag bearer is
the sled captain Derice Bannock.

1039
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:25,833
Derice's father, Ben Bannock,
was a gold medalist in the 200 meters...

at the Summer Olympic Games
over 20 years ago.

in two generations of this family.

01:19:42,711 --> 01:19:46,340
All right, guys, we're up. Come on. Hey,
knock it off. Knock it off, will ya?

1129
01:19:46,414 --> 01:19:49,611
Okay, let's go. Come on.
Get in your start positions.

1130
01:19:49,684 --> 01:19:53,814
We don't have to win the gold in the
first day. It's just like any other run.

something? Thank you.

[Al] The Jamaican team attempts
its first ever Winter Olympic event.

1140
01:20:20,382 --> 01:20:23,613
[Chuckling] And look at this.
They've got to get into that sled.

1141
01:20:23,685 --> 01:20:27,621
I've never seen anything
like this. I know it's not funny,
but how embarrassing.

1142
01:20:27,689 --> 01:20:30,522
Thank goodness. For a minute,
I didn't think they'd ever
get all four of them in.

1143
01:20:30,592 --> 01:20:33,220
And that could have been
a disaster.

[Cheering, Shouting]

1145
01:20:35,297 --> 01:20:38,095
[John Morgan] Well, most importantly
here, when you do get in the sled,

1146
01:20:38,166 --> 01:20:41,033
you have to get in with catlike
movements; you need to get relaxed.

1147
01:20:41,102 --> 01:20:45,061
Look at the high line in Omega!
He bounces off the wall,
ricochets like a pinball.

1148
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:48,667
The driver here, Derice Bannock, looks
like the sled's really drivin' him.

1149
01:20:48,743 --> 01:20:52,804
- That fool better watch his mouth.
- He better watch more than that.

1150
01:20:52,881 --> 01:20:56,681
This is the time when this team
may be thinking, "This may not
have been such a great idea."

1151
01:20:56,751 --> 01:20:58,844
Their heads are bouncing around.
This is amazing.

1152
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:01,684
Like rag dolls as they
come through the finish...

1153
01:21:01,756 --> 01:21:04,088
at a time of 58.04,

1154
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:06,753
which will be good enough
for last place.

You were ready and you choked.

1158
01:21:21,776 --> 01:21:25,712
Well, maybe we should
go over the turns again?

1159
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:30,274
You know the turns. You know everything
there is to know about this sport.

1160
01:21:30,352 --> 01:21:32,286
I'll tell you something.

1161
01:21:32,354 --> 01:21:35,812
You had all better figure out
how to stay loose out there.

That's something
I can't help you with.

about the damn Swiss?

1167
01:22:03,318 --> 01:22:07,482
I mean, it was all that "eins,
zwei, drei" nonsense that got us
all nervous in the first place.

1168
01:22:07,555 --> 01:22:10,854
Hey, man, look here. I'm just tryin'
to get us off on the right foot.

1169
01:22:10,926 --> 01:22:14,692
Well, the right foot for us is not
the Swiss foot. I mean, come on, Derice.

1170
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:18,255
We can't be copyin' nobody else's style.
We have our own style.

It's no stupid pushcart derby.

Let me tell ya somethin', Rasta.

1174
01:22:31,546 --> 01:22:34,538
I didn't come up here to forget
who I am and where I come from.

And neither did I.
I'm just tryin' to be the best I can be.

I can be is Jamaican.

Jeffries asked to see your ding-a-ling.

than the Swiss. That's a real
big difference from yesterday.

1205
01:24:14,983 --> 01:24:19,147
[Al] This is an absolute shock
in the making. Yesterday, they
were falling down at the start.

- Yes!
- Now they slide into place.

if you don't want to.

I'd made winning my whole life.

life, you have to keep on winning.

is a wonderful thing.

to win an Olympic medal.

an extreme case of Jamaican fever.
