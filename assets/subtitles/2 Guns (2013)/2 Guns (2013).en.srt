7,440 --> 00:01:29,204
- Hi.  - Hi.

2
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,406
How many?

3
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,566
Two.

4
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,761
Listen, I wanted to get a safe deposit box. Can you do that for me?

5
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,959
Okay. Your box will be available

6
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,450
any time from an hour after opening

7
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,086
to 30 minutes before close. This is your key.

8
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,406
Thank you.

9
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,403
Oh, um, also, if you open a checking account,

10
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,404
we'll give you 5% off the box along with free overdraft protection.

11
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,079
Oh, here I was hopin' for a free toaster.

12
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,400
Why would a bank give out free toasters?

13
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,241
Hello, Ma.

14
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,243
I'm ordering you the French toast.

15
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,439
No, thank you.

16
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,399
Our very patient waitress, Maggie,

17
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,481
well, at least it says Maggie on her name tag,

18
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,919
has asked me to order four times.

19
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,599
If I don't order at this point, it's just rude.

20
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,239
- I can come back.  - No, it's okay.

21
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,879
You know what? I'm making an executive decision.

22
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,079
- Pancakes.  - Okay.

23
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,279
No pancakes. I don't like pancakes. No pancakes.

24
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,439
What are you, a communist?

25
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,079
My friend'll have the pancakes and a fried egg.

26
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,399
I'm thinkin' hash, but only if it's like chunky style, okay?

27
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,679
Listen, if you order me eggs and pancakes, I'm gonna kick your behind.

28
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,640
But you gotta eat breakfast. It's the most important meal of the day.

29
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,599
Uh, ma'am, ignore everything he said, okay?

30
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,279
Don't bring me any eggs and pancakes.

31
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,443
Just bring me some coffee and bring him a couple eggs.

32
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,599
I don't want eggs. I want hash.

33
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,681
You know what, put a couple eggs on it.

34
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,999
Give him some rye toast, too.

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,599
No rye toast for me. I don't like rye toast.

36
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,959
- And a pancake.  - No pancakes.

37
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,719
Maybe a little silver-dollar one. You got the little baby ones?

38
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,724
No pancakes, no silver dollars, no rye toast. I like pumpernickel.

39
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,839
I do have pumpernickel. Pumpernickel toast.

40
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,919
- Hey, Maggie, wait. One more thing.  - Yeah.

41
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,239
That's for you. You take that with you till we see each other again

42
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,129
in case you miss me too much, okay?

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,809
- Why you gotta do that?  - What?

44
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,759
Wink at the waitresses like that?

45
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,489
- Waitresses like me.  - Nobody likes you.

46
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,319
- So?  - So.

47
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,399
What do ya got?

48
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,801
So, it is a sleepy bank.

49
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,639
- Doable?  - That's correct.

50
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,880
I told you.

51
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,050
That is a lot of doughnuts.

52
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,401
I'll be right back with your hash.

53
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,568
Maggie, your hot homemade doughnuts, they any good?

54
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,688
- Best in three counties.  - I'll tell you what you do.

55
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,879
You bring us three of those bad boys.

56
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,359
Put'em in a to-go box for us, all right?

57
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,691
- All right.  - Thank you.

58
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,040
All right, time to make the move.

59
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,887
All right, there's gonna be some sirens in this bitch.

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,240
I'm gonna go shake the weasel.

61
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,721
Shake the weasel. Gonna go shake the weasel.

62
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,519
- Hey. Good morning, sir. How are you?  - Morning.

63
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,681
Hey, Maggie.

64
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,159
I'm very sorry about my friend.

65
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,159
He was kicked in the head as a child.

66
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,128
- He's really not that bad.  - No, he is.

67
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,246
What's goin' on?

68
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,159
Okay, I'm just gonna have you all exit the building.

69
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,199
It might be a false alarm, but just do it safely.

70
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,202
Thank you. Thank you.

71
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,079
Is everybody out? I'm gonna need you to step outside.

72
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,359
All right, Maggie, I'm just gonna grab my friend.

73
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,646
- Okay.  - We gotta pay our bill.

74
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,401
We should go.

75
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,039
Is that all you're gonna leave for a tip?

76
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,559
It's 15%. You leave 15%.

77
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,759
No, you gotta leave at least 30.

78
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,959
No, you don't. 15% is standard.

79
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,279
My Maggie's about to be out of a job, man. Don't be cheap.

80
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,884
Okay, there's five. That's seven.

81
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,320
There you go. Come on.

82
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,561
All right.

83
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,319
What? No, you didn't.

84
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,810
- Yes, I did.  - Oh, my God.

85
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,807
How'd you say it?

86
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,559
Never rob a bank across from the diner

87
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,919
with the best doughnuts in three counties?

88
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,967
That's correct.

89
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,686
Bobby. Papi's down in the stables.

90
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,844
Why don't you get somethin' to eat?

91
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,039
I'm not hungry.

92
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,610
- Sure you are.  - I wanna come with you.

93
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,119
Hey, listen. We're here to do business. Diplomatically.

94
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,159
Well, I can be diplomatic.

95
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,959
You can be hungry, too, right?

96
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,166
Bobby.

97
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,851
- Wait here.  - Okay.

98
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,079
Somebody sittin' here?

99
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,159
Little Toro.

100
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,639
Oh, well, you move your feet, you lose your seat, right?

101
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,759
- Lose your head, too.  - That's correct.

102
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,444
So, where is Little Toro?

103
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,768
Alll¨ª, where you put him.

104
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,723
- Aqui?  - All¨ª.

105
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,811
Let's play some dominoes.

106
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,449
- Papi's ready.  - Yeah.

107
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,331
Papi Greco!

108
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,725
"I-know-a-guy" Bobby.

109
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,887
That's correct.

110
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:01,008
Quick, an ostrich, a tank of ether, a '63 Impala convertible.

111
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,839
Make it a '64.

112
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,679
My side of the border.

113
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,959
I know a guy.

114
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,530
What did I tell you? He never says no, never says maybe,

115
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,723
never says, "I'll see what I can do."

116
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,801
Nice bull.

117
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,407
I hope he's a good breeder.

118
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,205
That's a shame about Little Toro.

119
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,359
Julio caught him skimming.

120
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,521
Oh.

121
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,324
That don't sound like Little Toro.

122
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,523
Is that for me? That's correct.

123
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,559
Everybody skims a little cream. It's human nature.

124
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,882
Just 'cause it's human don't mean you let it go.

125
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,047
Hmm.

126
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,999
Nice lines. Good color.

127
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,039
That's right.

128
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,690
He knows a guy.

129
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,721
What you got for me?

130
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,120
Cash.

131
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,206
Cash?

132
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,929
Supposed to be givin' me 100,000 to deal.

133
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,000
Why didn't you give me $100,000 worth of cocaine?

134
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,119
Where's the cocaine?

135
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,565
My buyer wants cocaine.

136
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,279
So let him buy cocaine.

137
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,079
That's what he's tryin' to do. He's trying to buy cocaine.

138
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,639
I told him I knew a guy, therefore I come to you.

139
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,563
You the guy I know. That's why I told him.

140
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,119
So take back the passports.

141
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,203
After Little Toro, we're not takin' on any new customers.

142
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,679
Well, no disrespect, but I ain't no new customer.

143
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,126
You been dealin' with me for a long time.

144
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,605
You keep the passports.

145
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,719
Keep the money, too.

146
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,759
When you're ready to give me the product, give me the product.

147
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,886
Till then...

148
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,400
You owe me.

149
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,119
It's not very sporting, man.

150
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,566
At least give the chickens a chance to shoot back.

151
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,245
Hey, man, I'm just sayin'. If I'm gonna kill a defenseless animal,

152
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,959
I'm gonna honor its sacrifice by grilling it into some tasty barbecue.

153
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,759
What I'm not gonna do is torture it

154
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,491
just to prove I can't hit anything further away than my own pecker.

155
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,171
- Your cuate's a real junkyard dog.  - Mmm.

156
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,639
Hey, cowboy. You, the pretty one.

157
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,849
You ever hear the expression, "You got a face only a mother can love"?

158
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,164
That don't apply to you. You are uglier than the devil's asshole itself.

159
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,327
Stig!

160
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,801
What are you doin'?

161
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,999
They're torturing chickens, man.

162
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,331
What are you eatin'?

163
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,839
A chicken.

164
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,239
Come here. It's not the same thing, okay?

165
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,799
See that bag over there by the table?

166
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,280
Buffet table next to the potato salad.

167
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,039
Yeah, the bowling bag. What about it?

168
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,168
Little Tom's head is in that bag.

169
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,530
- Bullshit.  - Yeah.

170
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,563
You know what? That's fucked up, man.

171
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,319
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's go. Okay? Come on, let's go.

172
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,640
Say it in English, you goat fuck.

173
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,599
Suck my chicken.

174
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,999
That's funny comin' from you, fat boy.

175
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,920
You ain't seen your pecker since you were a baby.

176
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,199
Just 'cause you put your finger in your belly button

177
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,806
and brown shit comes out don't mean it's your asshole.

178
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,809
- What did you say?  - Don't worry about it, man.

179
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,328
Now dig 'em up and make some damn barbecue.

180
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,046
Bye, chica.

181
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,131
Did you just wink at him?

182
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,839
I did wink at him, 'cause he's my bitch now.

183
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,841
Uh... oh!

184
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,448
- That's good shootin'.  - Gracias.

185
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,281
You know, Little Toro never did nothin' to nobody, man.

186
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,085
We should rip off Papi's stash at the Tres Cruces Savings and Loan.

187
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,079
You know, Papi's guy delivers a briefcase

188
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,919
full of money to Tres Cruces every two weeks.

189
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,729
That's gotta add up to, what, like three million at least.

190
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,203
If Papi knew we were even talkin' about rippin' off Tres Cruces,

191
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,204
it would be our heads in that bag next to the potato salad.

192
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,330
No way. Our two heads would never fit in a bag that small.

193
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,959
Come on, man, let's hit the bank.

194
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,928
Little Toro was your friend. He was my friend.

195
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,809
- So?  - What do you mean "so"?

196
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,043
What if it was me? What if it was my head Papi ran through the saw mill?

197
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,730
- You wouldn't come after him?  - Nope.

198
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,599
- You wouldn't kill him?  - Nope.

199
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,921
Shit, man, he did that to you, I'd kill him. You know why I'd kill him?

200
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,559
Because you're my people and there's a code.

201
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,159
There is no code, first of all.

202
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,479
You do whatever you gotta do, whatever it takes.

203
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,720
And second?

204
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,839
Right, we're not people 'cause you don't have people.

205
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,046
That's correct.

206
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,764
Purpose for your visit to Mexico?

207
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,967
Quail hunting.

208
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,811
My aunt in Tuba City had a heart attack so we cut our trip short.

209
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,119
Tuba City?

210
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,326
It's near Odessa.

211
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,719
Nice place?

212
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,722
Hellhole, but she's my favorite aunt.

213
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,561
- Don't move. Let me see your hands.  - Oh, shit.

214
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,410
- Tell us about your trip.  - Lawyer.

215
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,679
- What's the big deal?  - Lawyer.

216
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,648
You were down in Sonora, weren't you?

217
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,764
You don't think Agent Jessup and the DEA know about you and Papi Greco?

218
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,119
Lawyer. Lawyer.

219
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,159
They know you were at his ranch.

220
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,321
I know I need a lawyer.

221
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,650
Tell Agent Rees about Papi Greco.

222
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,843
- Who?  - Papi Greco.

223
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,845
Well, who's that? Some Mexican Santa Claus or something?

224
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,289
Come on, Mr. Stigman.

225
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,320
I think it's in your best interest to cooperate.

226
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,480
You need to stop playin' the stupid card, all right?

227
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,799
Well, ma'am, it's my intent to cooperate with whatever you need.

228
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,879
I mean, as an American, I know you're just doin' your job,

229
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,999
and sometimes innocent folks like me get caught up in the system.

230
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,519
It's like the airlines. They don't lose your luggage on purpose, right?

231
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,399
But everybody takes it so damn personal.

232
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,159
Come on, Mr. Stigman. So you wanna play games?

233
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,961
Well, what'd you have in mind?

234
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,369
- Do you wanna help yourself?  - Yes.

235
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,161
Do I have to do it in front of him?

236
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,887
All right, we're done here. Thank you, Mr. Stigman.

237
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,485
- You gonna leave?  - Oh, yes.

238
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,567
Wow.

239
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,205
Oh, my God.

240
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,647
How do you concentrate workin' with her, man?

241
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,721
Five border agents are rippin' apart your car as we speak.

242
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,120
They ain't gonna find anything.

243
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,490
Where'd you hide the cocaine?

244
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,649
- Can they hear us?  - No.

245
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,251
- Can they see us?  - No.

246
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,726
Okay.

247
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,245
There was no cocaine.

248
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,639
- You had a deal in place.  - Right.

249
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,199
Five hundred passports in return for cocaine.

250
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,406
Right.

251
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,879
Hey, Bobby.

252
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,920
How you doin', Deb?

253
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,249
Good. Man, your boy Stig's a piece of work.

254
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,925
He winked at you, didn't he?

255
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,241
How'd you know?

256
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,490
Bobby didn't get the cocaine.

257
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,051
What? What happened?

258
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,399
Papi offered me cash. I told him no.

259
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,004
I told him to keep the passports,

260
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,159
so, eventually, he's gotta come up with the cocaine.

261
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,925
What about this guy you said you could flip? Little Toro?

262
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,288
I got him. It's real close.

263
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,723
I don't know who you are anymore.

264
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,646
It's like...

265
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,884
It's like you're out on this limb.

266
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,162
And you've been out there way too long.

267
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,924
And you're sayin' that to say what?

268
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,684
I don't like goin' to the funerals of my own men.

269
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,207
Well, then don't come, boss. Don't come.

270
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,407
Okay?

271
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,364
I spent the last three years of my life

272
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,766
crawlin' through a Mexican sewer

273
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,280
tryin' to work my way up the line to get next to Papi Greco.

274
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,044
You can't take me off this now.

275
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,247
Jessup, he's close.

276
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,442
- You can't take me off this now.  - I know.

277
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,251
Not now.

278
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,250
Two weeks.

279
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,610
You don't flip Little Toro by then, I'm pullin' ya out.

280
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,166
We're done.

281
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,004
Think Jessup knows about us?

282
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,167
What "us"? You don't do "us," remember?

283
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,365
Oh, I remember.

284
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,403
Besides, I'm dating.

285
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,519
Oh, right, right. You're dating...

286
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,679
Mmm-hmm.

287
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,843
Your imaginary boyfriend, Harvey.

288
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,044
Uh, he's not my boyfriend, and his name's not Harvey.

289
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,329
I like Harvey. It has a nice ring to it. Harvey.

290
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,519
You don't get to be jealous anymore, Bobby.

291
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,726
Harvey.

292
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,039
You pushed me away.

293
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,565
So you could be with Harvey.

294
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,250
Fuck you.

295
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,171
Little Toro's dead.

296
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,121
You told Jessup you were close to flipping him.

297
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,560
I was.

298
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,599
But when I got down to the ranch,

299
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,762
Papi's boys was throwin' his head around in a bag.

300
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,604
Well, that's game, then.

301
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,681
With Little Toro off the board, Jessup's pulling you out.

302
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,921
Not if you don't tell him.

303
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,759
- I'm your control, Bobby.  - That's correct.

304
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,761
I have to tell him.

305
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,168
That's why I need you

306
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,683
to let me rob Tres Cruces Savings and Loan.

307
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,927
You want to rob a bank?

308
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,281
No, Stig wants to rob the bank. It's his idea.

309
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,726
So there's no entrapment.

310
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,399
What I want is access to that money

311
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,448
that Papi's got in the safe deposit box.

312
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,159
You know no judge is gonna give you

313
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,730
a blanket warrant for the boxes.

314
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,764
We don't need a warrant. Not if the money's evidence in a crime.

315
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,319
We just trace it back to ownership,

316
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,164
we got Papi on tax evasion, possible RICO.

317
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,051
- Yeah?  - Yeah.

318
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,359
And what about Stig?

319
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,441
What about him?

320
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,841
He's a side dish.

321
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,279
You bust him in front of the bank,

322
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,965
he does a smooth 20 years in the penitentiary, you get a medal.

323
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,130
The bank gets us Papi.

324
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,605
And that's all that matters, right?

325
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,528
It takes whatever it takes, baby.

326
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,802
Did you ever really love me?

327
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,441
Hmm?

328
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,005
I really meant to love you.

329
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,320
Shit.

330
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,204
You don't have to knock. It's always open.

331
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,482
Yeah, good. Let's hit the bank.

332
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,681
Let's hit the bank.

333
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,484
- The Tres Cruces?  - That's correct.

334
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,687
Oh, shit.

335
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,799
Here I am still spinnin' about how we got yanked outta line at the border.

336
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,643
So you in or you out?

337
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,929
I'm in, yeah. It's just...

338
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,367
have you ever had anything like that happen to you before?

339
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,046
I mean, they were 100% convinced we were holding.

340
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,601
And we would've if Papi hadn't welched on that coke.

341
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,999
So you're sayin' that to say what?

342
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,650
I'm sayin' it's only 'cause you're hearin' it.

343
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,959
No, you sayin' somethin'.

344
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,199
And if you sayin' it, I'm hearin' it 'cause you're sayin' it.

345
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,319
What are you sayin'? Let it be said.

346
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,799
I think you're fuckin' playin' me.

347
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,847
Are you wanna be played?

348
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,999
I've been at your hip for 10 months,

349
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,880
but after this, I think maybe you're playin' me.

350
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,919
- I got you.  - No, you didn't.

351
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,399
Oh, I did. The corner of your eye was twitchin'.

352
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,970
The corner? That wasn't a twitch.

353
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,889
- That was a wink.  - That's my move.

354
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,607
Yup, that's Papi's chubby little kid right there.

355
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,890
Feed that motherfucker quesadillas...

356
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,159
Oh, my God.

357
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,199
She's chubby, too.

358
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,479
In all the right places.

359
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,881
How does an old, fat, ugly fuck get a girl like that?

360
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,326
Money.

361
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,521
All right, here we go.

362
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,043
Same thing every two weeks.

363
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,159
Papi flies over the border with a briefcase full of cash.

364
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,439
He spends a week with the mistress.

365
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,759
Ferret Nose Julio drives it out

366
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,205
to the Tres Cruces Savings and Loan.

367
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,439
Think they got three million in the bank, huh?

368
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,521
Easy.

369
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,201
Bingo.

370
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,479
Money, money, money, money.

371
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,766
Oh, yeah.

372
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,359
Why don't you hit the diner and check out the doughnuts?

373
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,409
I'm kinda more in a corned beef hash mood, to tell you the truth.

374
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,006
You never heard the saying,

375
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,679
"Never rob a bank across from a diner

376
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,569
that has the best doughnuts in three counties"?

377
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,360
- That's not a saying.  - Yes, it is.

378
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,839
- I get what you're sayin', but it's not a saying.  - You never heard it?

379
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,959
It is a saying. It's a saying now.

380
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,007
Okay. Let you tell it.

381
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,481
Make the move.

382
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,489
Bad DEA agent.

383
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,245
- Am I bad?  - Yes, you are.

384
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,401
I'm a bad girl?

385
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,726
Yes, you are.

386
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,242
Stig decided to hit the bank tomorrow, 3:00.

387
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,805
Stig decided?

388
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,566
Well, with or without me, he's goin' in.

389
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,449
Well, I still haven't talked to Jessup.

390
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,126
Stig doesn't know that. 3:00 tomorrow he's goin' in.

391
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,567
If we want Papi, I gotta go in with him.

392
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,482
You're not even gonna give me a choice, are you?

393
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,089
I'm givin' you no other options as a way to protect you.

394
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:26,208
Just have the troops meet me outside the bank, 3:05 when we come out.

395
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,359
3:05.

396
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,691
Okay. And don't shoot me.

397
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,928
- Even if you want to.  - We'll see.

398
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,245
License and registration, cowboy.

399
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,281
Cute.

400
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,279
- What's up, Teemo?  - What's up, brother?

401
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,930
- How are you, brother? I miss you, man.  - I miss you, man.

402
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,082
Got you a turkey burger. Special sauce.

403
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,559
Commander wants to see you.

404
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,686
Yes, sir.

405
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,648
So, half a mile from home.

406
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,767
I got Bobby all wound up and ready to go, sir.

407
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,645
Ordnance you requested.

408
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,519
Do you know, the Admiral's proud of what you've done.

409
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,759
You've gone way out on a limb.

410
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,759
If the bank falls right tomorrow,

411
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,599
he says you can come in from the cold, rejoin your brothers.

412
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,239
Great. Be good just to put the uniform back on, sir.

413
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,839
I didn't join the Navy to commit felonies and hang with drug dealers.

414
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,808
Even if you're damn good at it?

415
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,689
I do what I do for the Navy, sir.

416
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,199
It's all part of the Admiral's plan.

417
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,559
We get this three million from the bank,

418
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,919
we run cross-border ops on Papi and all the other cartels.

419
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,048
So tomorrow, clean and precise.

420
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,239
Tick all the boxes, nothing left undone. You got it?

421
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,685
Yes, sir.

422
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,447
Let's go.

423
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,361
Hey, nice jacket.

424
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,439
Hey, tell your mother she's gotta move out

425
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,010
of my house at some point, man.

426
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,087
All right, what do you want, clown or Frankie?

427
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,051
Frankie.

428
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,768
So, what'd you do with the 22?

429
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,241
Traded to my cousin for an espresso machine.

430
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,647
You're gonna need special beans for that, right?

431
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,239
Uh, uh, uh.

432
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,686
You can reach for your firearm, but do it real slow.

433
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,401
Any other people in the buildin'?

434
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,959
- What the hell is this?  - It's a bank robbery.

435
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,279
Only instead of robbin' the bank

436
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,599
and lettin' you chase after us,

437
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,443
we decided to come after you first.

438
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,561
Let's go.

439
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,930
All right, give me your gun, there.

440
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,765
All right, everybody sit down. Everybody sit down on the floor.

441
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,719
Ladies behind the counter, keep your hands visible, not on the alarms.

442
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,721
Let's go, let's go!

443
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,247
It's all right, girls. Just give 'em the drawer cash.

444
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,245
Did we ask for the drawer cash?

445
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,679
Come on, come on, come on. Sit right here. Sit, sit.

446
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,199
Let's go, on the floor.

447
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,680
- Hey, guard!  - Hey! Hey.

448
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,687
Look, I'm tryin' to be polite, all right?

449
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,769
Just sit tight and this'll be over soon.

450
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,321
Open the gate.

451
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,439
I don't have a key.

452
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,441
What'd you say?

453
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,721
Easy.

454
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,439
You lie to me again, it's gonna be more than a fuckin' problem.

455
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,441
Get out there, now.

456
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,919
Get on the floor.

457
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,570
You good? I'm goin' in.

458
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,760
Shh. It's all right.

459
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,570
Oh, Timothy.

460
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,489
Hey, it's okay.

461
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,331
It's okay. Yeah?

462
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,968
Okay. Here you go.

463
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,123
Showtime! Fire in the hole!

464
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,531
Holy shit!

465
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,999
Hey, Frankie, somethin's not right.

466
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,889
They're all stuffed with money.

467
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,844
I thought you said there would only be one or two.

468
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,769
Every single one of them.

469
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,082
I'm at 32 boxes and counting.

470
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,123
Look, there's way more than 3 million.

471
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,163
And there's still a lot more here.

472
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,800
All right, well, take 'em all. We'll figure it out later.

473
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,079
You go ahead, I'll get the rest.

474
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,161
All right.

475
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,640
Listen.

476
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,799
May be gunfire outside, okay? So if it hits,

477
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,280
you get everybody behind the counters.

478
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,119
This is for the jail across the street.

479
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,282
You let the cops out. Let'em out.

480
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,041
Come on.

481
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,889
That is a hell of a lot more than $3 million.

482
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,166
How much, you figure?

483
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,800
We couldn't be the luckiest chumps on the face of the earth, could we?

484
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,644
- You feel lucky?  - No, I don't.

485
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,370
I mean, this can't be Papi's money.

486
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,439
People are gonna chase us off the end of the earth for money like this.

487
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,920
Well, I hate to tell you this, Stig, but I got more bad news...

488
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,843
You take that hand away nice and slow, Bobby.

489
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,001
Okay.

490
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,531
Put the gun down, Stig.

491
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,599
You know I really like you, right?

492
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,806
I like you, too.

493
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,286
- No, you don't.  - Yes, I do.

494
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,239
Nobody likes me, okay? And I'm okay with it.

495
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,685
I do. I like you more than most.

496
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,599
You're not just sayin' it 'cause I got a gun pointed to you?

497
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,204
Why don't you just put the gun down?

498
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,839
Shit.

499
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,959
Oh.

500
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,769
Hot-doggin'!

501
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,441
I'm sorry, man.

502
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,087
What'd you do that for?

503
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,890
- Shit, man, I had to!  - No, you didn't.

504
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,959
It's just a little flesh wound. You'll be all right.

505
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,640
Drink the water, and then you'll be able...

506
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,011
What is that?

507
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,681
In your hand. Is that a badge in your hand?

508
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,479
Tell me you're not a no-good, two-timin' son of a bitch.

509
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,559
Two-timin'?

510
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,483
- Tell me.  - You shot me.

511
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,569
Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute, man. Hang on.

512
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,285
No, you wait a minute.

513
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,766
Stig.

514
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,281
Hey.

515
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:26,206
The United States is the greatest country in the world

516
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:30,365
because we accept a man is, at his core,

517
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,246
greedy,

518
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,720
selfish

519
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,521
and covetous.

520
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,206
I had no choice. They took my key.

521
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,169
I would never willingly open the vault.

522
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,368
Keep your hands on the desk, please.

523
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,363
In America, we line everybody up.

524
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,729
Say, "You're on your own."

525
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,525
"Grab all you can grab."

526
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,047
I'm innocent.

527
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,047
Nobody's innocent, friend.

528
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,085
There's just the guilty,

529
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,411
the ignorant

530
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,811
and the unlucky.

531
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,644
Did you take our money?

532
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,121
You fellas look like you're waitin' for a bus.

533
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,239
You guys let us know when you're done.

534
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,403
Oh, I'm done, and thank you for the courtesy.

535
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,561
Who is that guy?

536
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,279
You heard of the hidden hand of God?

537
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,248
Well, that's God's son of a bitch.

538
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:28,561
Call the DDO and get a list of everyone who knew we had money in this bank.

539
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,923
You two realize those sunglasses make you look like assholes.

540
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,279
Excuse me, when'd that diner burn?

541
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,399
Yesterday.

542
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,799
I want interviews with the wait staff

543
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,119
and every customer in the place.

544
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,770
It was just a grease fire.

545
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,489
Did I ask your opinion, Gomer?

546
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,079
You ever hear the saying,

547
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,879
"Never rob a bank across from a diner

548
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,008
with the best doughnuts in three counties"?

549
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,127
If that diner fire's a coincidence,

550
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,601
it's only 'cause we ain't looking hard enough.

551
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,206
That is an impressive amount of greenbacks.

552
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,931
43,125,000 of 'em, sir.

553
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,041
Mmm.

554
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,359
Recount it. Pack it up. We'll stow it back in Corpus.

555
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,279
It was my impression we were supposed to come out of that bank

556
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,799
with 3 million at most, sir.

557
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,119
Mmm-hmm.

558
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,167
Whose money was it?

559
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,970
Bad men unworthy of it.

560
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,323
Did you know Bobby Beans was DEA?

561
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,441
No, I didn't.

562
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,321
No offense, sir, but you really need to work on your surprised face.

563
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,570
Well, if he was DEA, he helped you rob a bank.

564
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,800
Which means he's dirty, and for that, I have no mercy.

565
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,568
- Where'd you leave him?  - In the desert.

566
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,768
- Is he dead?  - More than likely.

567
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,970
"More than likely."

568
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,765
You wanna tell me what that means?

569
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,159
The whole point of you working with Bobby Beans

570
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,519
was to kill him off and create a cut-out

571
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,159
so the OP couldn't get traced back to us.

572
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,119
My cover's solid. There's no way it'll trace back.

573
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,719
My cover is solid. There's no way it'll trace back, sir.

574
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,882
That's a call made above your pay grade.

575
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,727
Yes, sir.

576
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,244
Assign two of the boys to stow the money back at the naval base.

577
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,562
The rest'll come with us to check on the body of Mr. Beans.

578
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,364
Stigman, wanna come with me?

579
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,809
- Hey there, buddy.  - Hey.

580
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,079
You habla?

581
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,081
Yeah, yeah.

582
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,599
I hablo.

583
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,799
Good, that's good.

584
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,962
Don't trust in him till you see his paper.

585
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,682
If he's got papers, I'll see his papers. You got papers, right?

586
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,081
No. No, I got no papers.

587
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,969
Well, that's gonna be a problem.

588
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,239
See, Slim Jay and me, we done assigned ourselves

589
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,399
protection this here stretch of the border.

590
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,721
Officially unofficially.

591
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,847
So we really gonna have to see your papers.

592
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,008
Make sure you ain't no Muslim or nothin'.

593
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,320
Oh, yeah. No, I do have it.

594
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,528
And let me have your gun.

595
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,240
Give it to me.

596
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,040
Gracias.

597
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,647
You know how to pray?

598
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,571
Teemo. How we doin', boys?

599
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,763
Any sign of Bobby Beans?

600
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,929
Checked all the washes to the southeast.

601
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,805
No sign of a body.

602
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,046
All right.

603
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,370
Well, Stig, you put us in quite a hole.

604
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,279
I don't see it that way, sir, but you're the man with the oak leaves.

605
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,123
All that pride I had in you.

606
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,045
That loyalty?

607
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,599
You just tossed it to the wind

608
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,726
Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.

609
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,121
God damn it.

610
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,770
He's in the wash!

611
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,490
Go, go, go!

612
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,049
Come on, let's flush him out!

613
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,644
Where you going, Stigman?

614
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,725
It doesn't matter if you run.

615
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,366
Your jacket's wired, so you're six-months AWOL after stabbing an MP.

616
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,519
You talk to anyone, they're just gonna

617
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,090
hand you right back over to me.

618
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,207
You all right?

619
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,643
- Yeah.  - Then get your ass up!

620
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,961
Toss the gun.

621
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,081
Fuck!

622
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,081
Move!

623
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,721
Come on, come on!

624
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,766
Damn it!

625
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,330
Jesus! What am I supposed to do with this?

626
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,645
Aw, man. Aw!

627
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,406
Come on.

628
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,806
I'm a vet, not a trauma surgeon.

629
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,441
I can't help you with this, man. You gotta go.

630
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,601
Go where?

631
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,569
You gotta leave. I can't do anything.

632
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,210
Kenny, you remember a couple of months ago

633
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,449
you offered to sell me 500 hits of ketamine?

634
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,159
Yeah, you said you weren't interested.

635
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,321
Right.

636
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,209
'Cause I'm a DEA agent.

637
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,809
And if you don't fix me up,

638
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,125
I'm gonna go to the D.A.,

639
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,682
I'm gonna tell them that you like cruising Tori Amos concerts,

640
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,804
selling Special K to little weepy college girls.

641
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,166
There's no way you're a cop.

642
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,367
- No?  - No.

643
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,760
- You sure?  - I'm positive.

644
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,161
You have the right to remain silent.

645
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,959
You have the right to have a lawyer present during questioning.

646
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,999
Do I need to keep going?

647
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,759
No, I'm good. You're a cop.

648
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,966
Okay. Okay.

649
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,686
Nice shirt.

650
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,490
Thanks. It's JCPenney's.

651
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,801
- Yeah?  - Yeah.

652
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,399
All right, hold on one second.

653
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,999
Welcome to the Camino Real.

654
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,206
Thank you.

655
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,401
Hey.

656
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,210
- You were late.  - Jesus Christ.

657
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,691
What the hell happened?

658
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,649
- Excuse us.  - Excuse me.

659
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,719
I robbed a bank. What happened to you?

660
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,245
I was there with six agents at 3:05.

661
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,731
- No, you weren't.  - Yes, I was.

662
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,919
You were late.

663
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,206
You went early.

664
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,519
And it's not as if you couldn't have

665
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,488
pulled your badge at any time and stopped it.

666
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,359
- I did. Stig shot me.  - What?

667
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,169
He shot me in the shoulder.

668
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,481
We gotta take you to the hospital.

669
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,001
And interrupt your rendezvous with Harvey? I don't think so.

670
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,451
This is what we need to do,

671
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,921
we need to find Stig, we need to find the money.

672
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,761
All right. Listen.

673
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,439
Let me go upstairs, make my excuses,

674
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,726
and then we'll find Stig together, okay?

675
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,689
Okay, let's do this. Let's do this.

676
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,490
Why don't you recheck Stig's background?

677
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,802
Maybe there was something that we missed. All right?

678
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,482
I'm going to Stig's apartment and see what I can find out.

679
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,682
- All right?  - Okay.

680
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,131
Tell Harvey I said hi.

681
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,684
Who'd you patch up?

682
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,970
What are you talking about?

683
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,203
What am I talkin' about?

684
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,162
Well, there's a dune buggy parked out back

685
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,886
that was stolen by a man with a bullet hole in him.

686
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,970
Now, before he had a bullet hole in him,

687
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,046
he burned down a diner and robbed a bank.

688
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,322
I don't know anything about that, so...

689
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,047
Okay.

690
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,999
Okay?

691
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,081
Fair enough.

692
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,324
Say, let me ask you somethin'.

693
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,370
You ever play Russian roulette?

694
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,888
'Course not. What am I thinkin'?

695
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,562
The thing is, most people,

696
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,362
they put the gun to the temple.

697
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,491
And that's, well, that's just stupid.

698
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,366
What if...

699
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,841
The bullet's in the first chamber?

700
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,359
You blow a man's head off 'fore he's had a chance

701
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,442
to tell you what you want to know.

702
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,119
No. No, no. Come on, man.

703
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,926
Case in point.

704
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,966
Stig!

705
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,162
Stig.

706
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,846
Pick up, Bobby.

707
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,082
What the fuck are you doing here, Bobby?

708
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,759
What're you duckin' for, man?

709
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,410
You know I set you up, right?

710
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,969
They told me all about you.

711
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,528
Tough cat. Knows everybody. Doesn't have people.

712
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,605
That guy? Well, shit, that guy's a perfect cut-out.

713
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,922
I mean, he takes a bullet, who's gonna care, right?

714
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,931
Pick up the phone.

715
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,926
Pick up the damn phone, Bobby.

716
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,160
You got anything to say?

717
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,319
First question,

718
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,839
if you're DEA and you're clean, why are you here alone?

719
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,524
Where's your backup, Bobby?

720
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,279
Come on, it's this kind of attitude

721
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,121
makes me think you're not one of the good guys.

722
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,519
If I wanted you, I could've had you

723
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,682
before you walked into that building, Bobby.

724
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,328
That's a beautiful rifle, Stig.

725
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,891
Is that Army issue?

726
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,566
You like that? No, it's Kmart. Blue Light Special.

727
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,848
Now answer my question. Where's your backup?

728
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,401
No, no, that's a military rifle.

729
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:44,166
What's the military doing robbing banks, Stig?

730
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,879
Can we just have a straight-up conversation, Bobby?

731
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,484
I got you dead to rights.

732
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,406
Yeah? So shoot me.

733
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,006
Again.

734
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,921
No?

735
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,565
I'll shoot myself.

736
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,559
Huh. Not bad.

737
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,721
I'm glad you're impressed.

738
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,719
Were you testing me to see if I would shoot first?

739
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,165
Where's the money, Stig?

740
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,239
If I thought you were clean, I might tell you, but I don't, so I can't.

741
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,846
You're lying. You don't have it, do you? Where's the money?

742
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,602
- Oh, shit.  - What?

743
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,479
You're not the only one I was expecting.

744
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,880
Three very nasty men just showed up.

745
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,960
If they find you in my place, they will get ugly.

746
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,201
Who are they?

747
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,639
Yesterday I'd have said they were my family.

748
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,079
Today they kinda wanna kill me.

749
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,764
- I understand the feeling.  - You know, fuck you.

750
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,803
What do you know about family? You don't even have people.

751
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,119
No, Bobby, that's a stupid idea.

752
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,201
They're already comin' up the stairs.

753
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,600
Bobby!

754
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,050
I told you. Now, Bobby,

755
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,319
hang up the speaker and answer your cell phone, okay?

756
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,926
If you want me to help you out...

757
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,799
Yeah.

758
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,881
Just stay in the shadows, okay?

759
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,365
I'm gonna guide you out from there.

760
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,086
Wait.

761
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,281
Wait.

762
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,599
He's comin' up your rear. You better dart across the hall.

763
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,409
Go over to the bedroom and hide behind the lockers.

764
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,647
Go.

765
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:35,205
All right, Bobby, you're gonna wanna scoot across the hall. Go.

766
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,399
Bobby, Bob...

767
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,161
Shit.

768
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,325
- Teemo!  - Rooftop!

769
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,326
Target's on the move!

770
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,641
Sorry, Teemo.

771
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,129
Where's our money?

772
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,522
I have no idea what you're talkin' about.

773
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,330
You think DEA can just waltz into our bank,

774
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,727
steal our money, and we're not gonna kick?

775
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:31,887
Your man Bobby Trench stole 43 million of our dollars.

776
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,804
We'd like it back.

777
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,929
Because it's our money.

778
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:38,924
Because it's a blatant act of disrespect.

779
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,208
And because it's our money.

780
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,560
Please tell me it's you, Bobby.

781
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,723
Anything new on Stig?

782
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,645
He's comin' up clean on every database I'm cleared for.

783
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,087
No military connection? No record of service?

784
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,811
To go deeper, I'd need to get clearance from Jessup.

785
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,239
Well, try your old contacts in the military.

786
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,004
I'm gonna tell Jessup everything I know.

787
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,400
Wait, are you sure?

788
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:10,086
Someone has to know whose money was in the bank.

789
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,480
Yeah. Stig.

790
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,239
Stig didn't even know I was DEA.

791
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,766
Besides, somebody tried to kill him, too.

792
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,684
Bobby, let me help you. What do you need?

793
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,251
Take it easy. Bye.

794
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,646
Bobby.

795
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,001
Fuck!

796
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:46,483
That's how you take down a man. Now shut the door.

797
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,450
Just let it come.

798
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,688
Agent Robert Lynn Trench.

799
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:10,530
A.k.a. Bobby T, a.k.a. Bobby B, a.k.a. Bobby Beans.

800
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,290
Let's have a chat.

801
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,079
You stole $43.125 million

802
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,321
that did not belong to you.

803
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,084
Now, man-to-man,

804
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:50,162
who at DEA authorized you to rob our bank?

805
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,565
You a banker?

806
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,847
You ever play Russian roulette?

807
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,880
Thing is,

808
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,885
most people put the gun to the temple.

809
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,043
Well, that's just stupid.

810
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:19,119
You blow a man's head off 'fore he's had a chance

811
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:21,327
to tell you what you wanna know.

812
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,929
Mess up your suit, too.

813
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,359
Who told you it was all right to take our money?

814
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,488
"Our money. Our bank."

815
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,081
Who are ya?

816
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,568
If you don't know who I am,

817
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,927
how did you know to steal our 43 million?

818
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,844
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

819
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,650
- You don't?  - No.

820
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,241
Well...

821
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,126
Where's the money?

822
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,611
Oh, boy.

823
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:08,931
Well, uh...

824
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:13,127
it ain't down there, I can guarantee you that.

825
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,250
Whoo-hoo.

826
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,759
A.k.a. Bobby Balls.

827
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,285
Clean and shaven.

828
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,010
You know what you are?

829
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,326
You

830
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,681
are a dirty DEA agent.

831
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,811
That's right.

832
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,807
You're a dirty DEA agent who robbed a bank.

833
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,485
And shot your boss.

834
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,801
You walk into any federal office,

835
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,369
and that's the story they're gonna have.

836
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:26,406
Unless you bring me $43.125 million,

837
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,971
and you walk away. Clean.

838
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,643
Have I properly incentivized you?

839
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,249
More than you know.

840
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:43,202
Unless you wanna rot in jail, you best get after it.

841
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,961
Go on, now. Go on.

842
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,521
All right.

843
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,809
You're thinkin' he deserved better?

844
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,480
You're right.

845
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,531
Hey, Rudy.

846
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,445
Hola, Javier.

847
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,851
Morning, Papi.

848
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,001
Don't move.

849
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,399
Go inside, quick.

850
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,401
Mommy!

851
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,001
Whose money did we steal?

852
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,161
You really wanna know?

853
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:54,845
I really wanna know.

854
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,599
Easy, old man, get in there. Get in there.

855
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:05,601
Payback's a bitch!

856
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:08,919
Payback's a bitch!

857
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:09,959
Uh, uh, uh.

858
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,119
- Whoa, Bobby.  - Drop the gun. Give me the keys.

859
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,639
Give me the keys. Nice and easy.

860
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:14,607
I can't do that.

861
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,759
- Why not?  - Well, I got him first. I got dibs.

862
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:19,319
I got a .44. I'm taking Papi. Give me the keys.

863
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,641
You want 'em? Come get 'em.

864
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,999
Now, I see the wheels turnin'.

865
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,119
You're thinkin' a little blindfold, maybe use your teeth.

866
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,407
That's not what I'm thinkin'. You know what I'm thinkin'?

867
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,123
Oh, shit, man. How's that?

868
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,884
That was uncalled for.

869
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:34,279
Shit. I liked you better when you were "I-know-a-guy" Bobby.

870
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,959
That Bobby was a good guy.

871
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:38,039
Well, I liked you better when you were winkin' at waitresses

872
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,759
and shootin' the heads off of chickens.

873
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,603
Give me the keys. Give me the keys.

874
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,923
Shit!

875
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:47,082
- You saw that move comin'?  - That's correct. Give me the keys.

876
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:48,765
Damn, you're good.

877
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,040
Now, one of us is gonna have to pick up those keys.

878
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,046
- Guess.  - All right. I'll get 'em, all right?

879
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,880
- Get 'em, get 'em.  - Put that musket away, man.

880
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,489
- Hey, pull over!  - Pull over?

881
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,369
Hey, Papi, you like my drivin'?

882
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:36,526
Oh, shit!

883
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,887
Come on, Bobby, I ain't got all damn day!

884
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,526
What do you wanna do?

885
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:51,567
Ow!

886
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,283
All right. All right, all right. All right, let me go.

887
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,479
You let me go first.

888
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,527
No, you let me go.

889
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,291
On three. On three.

890
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:16,085
One. Two. Three.

891
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,919
See? Now you're making me not be able to trust you.

892
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:20,524
On the count of three, we'll let each other go.

893
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,919
- All right?  - All right. That's fair.

894
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,126
One. Two.

895
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,281
Three.

896
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:26,519
I knew it. Let me go.

897
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,759
- No!  - I'm gonna let you go. I'm gonna let you go.

898
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,046
- All right.  - One...

899
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,645
Ow!

900
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,247
Ow!

901
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:40,770
Come on, man. You gotta admit, that was kind of fun, no?

902
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:43,131
You didn't like that?

903
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,646
Who are you?

904
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,081
Shit.

905
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,169
- U.S. Navy Intel.  - Yeah?

906
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,560
Or I was.

907
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:54,079
My commander FUBARed my jacket.

908
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:56,159
And now I'm AWOL after stabbing an MP.

909
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:59,767
You're lucky. They got me framed for killing my boss.

910
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,281
Did your boss order your four closest friends to kill you?

911
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,210
No, you got me there.

912
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,210
Petty Officer Michael Stigman.

913
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:12,530
DEA Officer Bobby Trench, but I guess you know that already.

914
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:13,681
Pleasure.

915
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,199
So, what, you just happened to pick me,

916
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,168
or you got orders to set me up on purpose?

917
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,439
I had orders, man. I didn't know you were DEA.

918
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,639
My people did. But they're Intel.

919
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:22,839
There's not much they don't know.

920
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,079
Your people?

921
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:25,319
Now I'm just trying to piece together the truth,

922
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,519
so I can take it over my commander's head to the Admiral.

923
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,000
That's why they wanna kill me and why I wanted to talk to Papi.

924
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,561
Right.

925
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:33,326
Well...

926
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:37,841
I guess we can both talk to him at the same time.

927
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,199
What, like we're workin' together?

928
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,639
No, not like we're working together.

929
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,405
- Yeah.  - No, like we're workin' in the same vicinity.

930
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,559
- Together.  - In the same area code.

931
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:47,079
- Together.  - The same county.

932
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,082
And don't get all "We Are The World" on me either.

933
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,999
- When this is over, I'm still gonna shoot you.  - But we're partners.

934
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,679
Come on, man, Ebony and Ivory.

935
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,728
Shit, I think he puked. He's puked or he's dead.

936
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,525
Oh, yeah, he puked.

937
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,001
Hey.

938
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:04,519
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you both.

939
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:05,839
This might take a while.

940
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,330
I got all day, partner.

941
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:08,719
Hold on.

942
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,640
Let me put that in there with ya. Put that on ya.

943
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:19,487
- So...  - Partner, how you wanna do this?

944
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,479
I like that, it's got a nice roll off your tongue there.

945
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:24,848
We're not that close. Don't kumbaya with me. Don't kumbaya.

946
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,119
I'm gonna get my bucket and towel and waterboard his ass.

947
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:30,759
No, we gotta give him a chance to talk. You got anything to say?

948
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:32,879
I hope you guys like the taste of balls,

949
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:36,282
because I'm gonna chop yours off, stuff 'em in your mouths.

950
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,439
See?

951
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,808
Or maybe I'll put yours in his and his in yours.

952
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,439
Want me to get the bucket?

953
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:43,601
Kumbaya.

954
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:48,961
So why were you puttin' so much money in Tres Cruces?

955
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,885
It's Tres Cruces.

956
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,891
We thought you just stashed a little cash there

957
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:56,850
until we robbed the place, found 40 million. Why is that?

958
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,359
You robbed Tres Cruces?

959
00:58:58,360 --> 00:58:59,799
That's correct. Why is that?

960
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,167
That's funny, huh?

961
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,480
You're dead.

962
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,559
- Yeah, that is funny, isn't it?  - You're both dead.

963
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,848
And I didn't even have to kill you.

964
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,645
I thought you were sharp. "I-know-a-guy" Bobby.

965
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:17,081
But you...

966
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,529
You just ripped off the CIA.

967
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,811
The CIA?

968
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,439
The CIA.

969
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,879
He's full of crap. Why would he have money in the same bank as the CIA?

970
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,999
Why would you have money in the same bank as the CIA?

971
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,331
I don't have shit in that bank.

972
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:35,479
The only money I deliver to Tres Cruces

973
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,562
- is a payment.  - To the CIA?

974
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:42,046
The CIA. They take 7% of my revenue.

975
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:45,119
In return, they let me use their planes

976
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:46,770
so I can get my shit across the border.

977
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:52,321
I could do it a lot cheaper, but there was really no negotiations.

978
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:53,521
You know...

979
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,727
They take it from all the cartels.

980
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:58,520
Bullshit.

981
00:59:58,760 --> 00:59:59,921
Okay.

982
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,051
They're still gonna kill you.

983
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:11,486
Bobby?

984
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,004
You said stop by anytime.

985
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:17,159
- You kidnapped a drug kingpin! -That's correct.

986
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:20,004
Papi Greco! And you tied him up in my garage!

987
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,440
You mind if I swipe a yogurt?

988
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:31,079
Yeah, sure. Please. Help yourself to anything. Take whatever you want.

989
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:32,279
It's just a yogurt.

990
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:33,805
But it's her yogurt. Just put it back.

991
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:36,207
Please.

992
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,559
Are you two like ex-boyfriend and girlfriend?

993
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:42,119
Actually, you know what? We never put a name on it.

994
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:44,039
So, what, you broke his heart or he broke yours?

995
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,964
Wow, this guy will really ask anyone anything at anytime.

996
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:48,879
Why don't you go and check on Papi, huh?

997
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,001
What do you see in this guy?

998
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,559
I could go on for hours, but I don't know you,

999
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:55,079
and I don't think this is the right time

1000
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:56,605
for us to have this conversation, okay?

1001
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,519
So daddy issues, huh?

1002
01:00:58,520 --> 01:00:59,567
Daddy!

1003
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,891
Garage. Papi. Go.

1004
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,850
- I get it now.  - Go. Go to the garage.

1005
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,446
- Can I have the yogurt?  - You can have the yogurt. Here.

1006
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:09,679
- I don't like her, man.  - You don't get a vote.

1007
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:10,841
I'm gonna watch her.

1008
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:14,084
Bobby. What are you doing?

1009
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:17,688
Are you 100% sure you can trust this guy?

1010
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,162
No. But he's all the help I got.

1011
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,041
Jessup's dead.

1012
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:27,166
The money we stole was CIA money. They came lookin' for it.

1013
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:30,644
I'm sorry, Deb, I didn't mean to get you involved in all this.

1014
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,441
You okay?

1015
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,130
What are you smirking at?

1016
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:46,319
You know, I've been racking my brain

1017
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:47,970
trying to figure out who you look like.

1018
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:49,690
And it finally dawned on me.

1019
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:52,440
You look like a Mexican Albert Einstein.

1020
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:54,528
Minus the genius factor, obviously.

1021
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:56,125
You want some yogurt?

1022
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,246
Payback's a bitch.

1023
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:02,206
That's for Little Toro.

1024
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:45,001
Stig.

1025
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:55,087
Stig!

1026
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:56,679
Pack it up!

1027
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:57,681
Move it, move it!

1028
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,364
- Stig.  - The one and only.

1029
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:02,559
That your people?

1030
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:03,800
Do you have to say it like that?

1031
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:05,485
Like what? They're your people, right?

1032
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:08,120
Technically, yes, but I thought you were my people now.

1033
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:10,359
All right, two taps, we'll hit the garage. On go.

1034
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:12,089
- Okay. On your go.  - Go!

1035
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:39,287
Fuck.

1036
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:42,519
What was that about?

1037
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:43,681
That was messed up.

1038
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:44,999
What the hell is going on?

1039
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,126
I don't know.

1040
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:48,931
I don't know.

1041
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:52,685
Give me your phone, now.

1042
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:57,919
I'll take the car, too. Get out. Get out!

1043
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:58,967
Oh, my God.

1044
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:14,922
Est¨¢ en un gray Charger.

1045
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,962
How did Stig's people know to come to your house?

1046
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:26,359
I don't know. They must have followed you.

1047
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:27,479
I don't think so.

1048
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:28,839
We would have seen 'em.

1049
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:29,841
We should have seen 'em.

1050
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:32,842
How'd they know to come to your house?

1051
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:34,327
Hmm?

1052
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,559
Why were they at your house, Debbie?

1053
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:43,891
No. You serious?

1054
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:47,081
Bobby...

1055
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:27,610
Out of the car, gabacho.

1056
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:28,841
Hurry up.

1057
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:31,003
You fucked up now, I see.

1058
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:32,726
On your knees.

1059
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,082
I know some guys, too, Bobby.

1060
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:48,682
Bag 'em up. Let's take 'em home.

1061
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:56,359
- Do you wanna talk about it?  - No.

1062
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:57,850
- You sure?  - Yeah, I'm sure.

1063
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,199
I told you I didn't like her, man.

1064
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:01,281
Shut up.

1065
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:02,839
What are you gettin' mad at me for?

1066
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:04,159
Because you talk too much.

1067
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,199
What'd I ever do to you?

1068
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,725
Besides shoot me?

1069
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,119
You know what you are? You're a misanthorpe.

1070
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:10,799
It's misanthrope. I'm a misanthrope.

1071
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,039
Did you know what I meant to say?

1072
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:14,599
No. What did you mean to say?

1073
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,443
- That you don't like people.  - Shut up.

1074
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,239
Time for my massage.

1075
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:28,084
Yeah. I'll have housekeeping clean up your bed.

1076
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,686
Oh, shit.

1077
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:40,759
My grandfather cut cane for 30 years every day and never got a blister.

1078
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,928
Says it smells like hell,

1079
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,204
toughens the hands.

1080
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:48,999
You know what I like about this?

1081
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,209
Not only do I get to take my time with you guys,

1082
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:55,961
but this time, I don't have to worry about leaving any marks.

1083
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:57,964
Don't put your hands on me, man.

1084
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,402
- Shit.  - What did you say?

1085
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:03,927
Just don't put those pissy hands on me, man.

1086
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:08,681
You ain't got a home, Bobby.

1087
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:11,439
DEA doesn't want you around.

1088
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:12,601
Not with your sins.

1089
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,119
Payback's a bitch.

1090
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:18,088
You smell like warm Corona, man.

1091
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:27,520
You remember my prize breeding bull.

1092
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:30,685
With cojones the size of coconuts.

1093
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,286
You wanna see him?

1094
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:34,010
No, it's okay. We can see good from here.

1095
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:35,451
Adi¨®s, Bobby.

1096
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:36,721
No, no.

1097
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:46,526
Shit!

1098
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:50,961
43 million!

1099
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:53,599
It's everything we stole from the CIA.

1100
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,319
You let us go, we'll bring it to you.

1101
01:07:58,160 --> 01:07:59,321
I got the money.

1102
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,039
- What are you talking about?  - I got it.

1103
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:03,199
- You don't have it!  - I know I don't have it. He doesn't know that.

1104
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,399
But you don't have the money.

1105
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,079
I know you don't have it, 'cause I have it.

1106
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:07,199
You have it? Well, where is it?

1107
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:08,167
Commander Quince's safe.

1108
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:10,561
- Corpus Christi Naval Air Station.  - Don't tell me. Tell him.

1109
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:12,486
Oh, shit!

1110
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:13,801
Where is it?

1111
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:17,527
Commander Quince's safe! Corpus Christi Naval Air Station!

1112
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:22,359
The guy's pissing on us, and you're askin' if we should fuckin' tell him.

1113
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:25,409
If that's the truth, I might as well just kill you now.

1114
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,049
I had a run-in with a couple boys out of your organization.

1115
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:44,521
Hello, Earl.

1116
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:49,844
Mr. Bobby Beans and Mr. Michael Stigman.

1117
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:53,084
Well, they're not from my organization.

1118
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:55,004
They're freelancers.

1119
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:57,886
And Bobby Beans is undercover DEA.

1120
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,961
And Mr. Stigman's AWOL U.S. Navy.

1121
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:06,759
They stole 43.125 million from the Tres Cruces.

1122
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:08,239
We want it back.

1123
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:09,719
Is there a finder's fee?

1124
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:11,519
Fee is we let you continue to do business.

1125
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:14,205
Fee is we don't raise our cut from 7% to 20.

1126
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:18,679
The fee is we don't come down here with a squad of Apache A-6 helicopters

1127
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:20,409
and wipe you off the face of the earth.

1128
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:24,043
You like my country weak and corrupt, don't you?

1129
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:27,366
So you can buy your cheap crap at the mall.

1130
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:30,929
Well, Earl, I'm not cheap.

1131
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:34,048
Is this about pride, Manny?

1132
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,479
About machismo?

1133
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:38,721
Prove you got a big Mexican cock?

1134
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:42,079
Well, your cock is huge. It's massive.

1135
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:45,084
And I, I'm in awe of your cock.

1136
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,885
So what? You're still a drug dealer.

1137
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:51,204
And I'm still the government of the United States.

1138
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,570
It's a free market, Manny.

1139
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:56,885
Not a free world.

1140
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:00,159
I'll take a look.

1141
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:02,288
Hard! You'll look hard.

1142
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,290
Under every rock in Mexico.

1143
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,969
Let's get out of this shithole.

1144
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:36,169
I've decided to let you bring me the 43 million.

1145
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,399
The truck'll take you north to the border.

1146
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:41,439
From there, you'll cross on foot with the coyotes.

1147
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:42,726
If it's all the same, we'd rather drive.

1148
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:44,879
With everybody lookin' for you,

1149
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,279
they'd pull you out of line in two seconds.

1150
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:47,611
No, you go the way you force my people.

1151
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:49,119
If we can't risk crossing,

1152
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,359
how are we supposed to bring you back the money?

1153
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:52,601
I'll meet you north of the border in 24 hours.

1154
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:59,642
Now, I'm trusting you to fulfill your part of the bargain.

1155
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:11,201
Hey, Bobby.

1156
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:14,570
You got 24 hours to bring me the money.

1157
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:16,523
Or I'm gonna shoot her right in the head.

1158
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:19,599
Then I'm gonna find you,

1159
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,762
and I'm gonna gut you like a pig!

1160
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:26,921
Stig!

1161
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:59,368
When this is over, I'm still gonna shoot you.

1162
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,244
Whatever it takes, Bobby.

1163
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:13,479
Pick one. I can get in anything.

1164
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:14,879
So, what about the Audi?

1165
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,799
No, I don't do German, okay? Locks are tricky, too many alarms.

1166
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:19,325
Okay. Suburban?

1167
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:20,639
That one's 2010.

1168
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,881
It's gonna get like two miles a gallon. I ain't payin' for all that gas.

1169
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,764
For a car thief, you are mighty particular.

1170
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:26,121
I'll break into the Honda.

1171
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:27,759
I look like I'm gonna ride in that Honda to you?

1172
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:28,919
You could.

1173
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:30,559
And you could pick somethin' with a little more class.

1174
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:31,959
I hate to remind you, but we're breakin'

1175
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:33,239
onto a high-security Navy base.

1176
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:34,479
We ain't goin' to the hip-hop opera.

1177
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,159
It ain't no Les Mis¨¦rables for you tonight.

1178
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:37,161
Les Mis¨¦rables!

1179
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:38,399
Oh, man, whatever the fuck, man.

1180
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:39,479
Don't remind me.

1181
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:43,159
Look, it's not my fault Quince took the money back to the base.

1182
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:44,799
I thought you said you took the money back to the base.

1183
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,165
No, I never said that.

1184
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:47,759
So the money could be anywhere.

1185
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:49,679
It could be in East Jabip, the Cayman Islands...

1186
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,159
No, the money is on the base, okay?

1187
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:52,999
I gave it to Commander Quince at the Camino Real,

1188
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,519
and he told the guys to take it back to the base.

1189
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:56,648
Right before he took you out and tried to kill you.

1190
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,199
That doesn't mean he's lyin' about the base.

1191
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:02,359
Not everybody's as paranoid as you, Bobby. Jeez.

1192
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:04,681
What about the Prius? You like the Prius?

1193
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:06,806
Camino Real.

1194
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:08,160
Yeah, it's a hotel.

1195
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:10,479
I met Debbie at the Camino Real.

1196
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:11,481
No shit?

1197
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:12,840
- Yeah.  - What was she doin' there?

1198
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,040
She said she was there to meet her boyfriend, Harvey.

1199
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:17,199
Wait. Your girlfriend has a boyfriend?

1200
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:18,531
She's not my girlfriend.

1201
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:20,601
Holy shit.

1202
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:23,566
Yeah, just pick a car.

1203
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:25,486
Right here.

1204
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:27,281
You picked that one?

1205
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,401
Yeah.

1206
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,804
Fuck you want, a fuckin' Bentley?

1207
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,406
I got it.

1208
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:51,484
- Hi.  - Hey.

1209
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:53,931
Crazy question,

1210
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:56,851
you wouldn't have anybody knows how to fix a snowmobile?

1211
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,001
I don't think so.

1212
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,519
Would you check for me? I really need it fixed by tonight.

1213
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:01,931
Why, a big storm coming?

1214
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:03,969
You never can be too sure.

1215
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:06,241
I'll be right back.

1216
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,525
- Up with that?  - What?

1217
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:11,648
She smiled at you, you didn't wink at her?

1218
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:13,723
I don't wink at every woman I see.

1219
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:17,487
Snowmobile in Texas, huh? You must be in some serious shit, sailor.

1220
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:19,000
You got yourself a new claw, huh?

1221
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:21,242
- Gimme claw. Give it a pound.  - It's a beaut.

1222
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:23,164
You still got my rainy-day stash?

1223
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:24,446
Yeah.

1224
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:29,771
See ya later, Stig.

1225
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:31,041
All right.

1226
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,439
You know what they say, talk softly and carry an M-4 with a grenade launcher.

1227
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:38,726
Wow.

1228
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:41,451
Which one you want?

1229
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:42,880
This one.

1230
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:44,724
What's your plan for gettin' on the base?

1231
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,087
I'm workin' on it.

1232
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:02,599
Remember, once we get to the command building,

1233
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,279
Quince's office is first floor, end of the hall.

1234
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:06,439
If he's not in the field, that's where he lives 18 hours a day.

1235
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:07,885
Right, right. But you still haven't told me

1236
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,639
what the plan is to get through the gate.

1237
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:12,166
I got a plan. I mean, I'm capable of comin' up with a plan.

1238
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:13,359
I'm not sayin' you're not capable,

1239
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:14,771
I'm just sayin' you haven't told me. What is it?

1240
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:16,370
I'm workin' on it.

1241
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:18,846
Better work faster.

1242
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,081
Much faster.

1243
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:30,319
Move it up. Quickly.

1244
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:31,321
Fuck it.

1245
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:32,927
Halt!

1246
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:34,491
He's going through!

1247
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:36,845
That fast enough for ya?

1248
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:41,081
Shit!

1249
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:45,248
Let's go! Let's go! On the radio now!

1250
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:46,486
Return to post!

1251
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,119
That was your plan?

1252
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:56,319
Well, we're on the base, aren't we?

1253
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:59,279
That's not a plan. Nobody in their right mind breaks into a naval base.

1254
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,039
That's why it's a brilliant plan. No one expected it.

1255
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:04,079
You shoulda seen your face. Damn, they were surprised.

1256
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,719
Your stop comin' up. I'll play decoy,

1257
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:07,319
lead 'em away, try to get to the Admiral, okay?

1258
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:09,926
All right. Things go wrong, I'll see you back at the boat yard.

1259
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:11,201
Things ain't goin' wrong.

1260
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:14,523
I'm gettin' a medal. I get to the Admiral, I'm gettin' a medal. Watch.

1261
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:18,120
You're gonna wish me luck, aren't ya?

1262
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:19,799
- Come on, man, let's hear it!  - Good luck.

1263
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:21,399
Quince's office at the end of the hall.

1264
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:23,721
Remember, first floor, end of the hall!

1265
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,323
Halt! Stop where you are!

1266
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:39,079
We have a breach at Status Hall!

1267
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:40,120
Go, go, go, go!

1268
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:42,885
Up the stairs!

1269
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:48,044
Sir, Petty Officer Michael Stigman, ID number 540333.

1270
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:50,561
Wait a minute, what's the problem?

1271
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,962
Shit, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that to you, man.

1272
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:54,807
Sir.

1273
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:56,327
I've been in service 12 years.

1274
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:58,639
I've never stepped foot in an officers' mess, much less crashed it.

1275
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,130
Please, sir, it's an emergency.

1276
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:02,325
Stand outside, please.

1277
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:06,368
- Leave us alone.  - Thank you, sir.

1278
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:07,919
Hey, I'm really sorry about that, man.

1279
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:10,239
I didn't mean to hit you like that. I apologize.

1280
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:12,599
I'm listening, sailor. Sit.

1281
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:13,806
Thank you, sir.

1282
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:21,040
- Try the Admiral again for me.  - Yes, sir.

1283
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:38,919
And you believed this stolen money

1284
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:41,844
would all be used to fight drug cartels?

1285
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,731
Yes, sir. I thought the orders came down the valid chain of command.

1286
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:46,763
Blind loyalty is not loyalty.

1287
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:48,600
I know that, sir, and that's why I'm here.

1288
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:50,799
Well, you've shown a lot of tenacity

1289
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,450
and a lot of guts bringing this to me.

1290
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:54,802
Thank you, sir. That means the world comin' from you.

1291
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:59,530
Unfortunately, there's nothing I can do for you.

1292
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:01,959
Of course, sir. I mean, you can just lock down the base.

1293
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:03,200
You can arrest Commander Quince.

1294
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:06,204
The United States Navy does not rob banks.

1295
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:08,362
Its personnel did not rob a bank.

1296
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:12,167
I'm not gonna tarnish the integrity of the Navy over one crooked sailor.

1297
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:13,999
If there was money taken from the bank

1298
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,970
that was part of an illegal CIA slush fund,

1299
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:19,600
the Navy had no knowledge the fund existed.

1300
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:24,039
Your jacket has you six months AWOL?

1301
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:25,041
Yes, sir.

1302
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:27,129
It's gonna stay that way.

1303
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:33,410
Commander Quince's jacket will likewise be amended so he's also AWOL,

1304
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:35,847
making none of this the Navy's problem.

1305
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:38,208
Sir, this isn't right.

1306
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:40,044
Well, I'd offer more,

1307
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:41,679
but when the hand has gangrene,

1308
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:43,682
you chop it off to save the body.

1309
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:48,331
You don't keep the pinkie around just because it meant well.

1310
01:19:56,920 --> 01:20:00,720
Have Petty Officer Stigman dropped outside the main gate.

1311
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:04,811
He sets foot on a military base anywhere in the world,

1312
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:07,530
I want him shot.

1313
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:08,879
This is bullshit.

1314
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:11,201
You know, men like me fight and die on the orders of men like you!

1315
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:14,204
Without us, those stars on your shoulder are a fucking costume!

1316
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:33,921
Open the safe.

1317
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:35,079
Does your boss know you're doin' this?

1318
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:36,199
Open it.

1319
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:38,521
Or did the CIA kill her like they did Jessup?

1320
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:40,799
What's it to you?

1321
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:41,881
I don't like loose ends.

1322
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,047
Neither do I...

1323
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:45,407
Harvey.

1324
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:49,481
Huh?

1325
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:52,003
Well, my mother named me Harold.

1326
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:54,601
I like Harvey. Harvey has a nice ring to it.

1327
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:56,530
Don't you like Harvey?

1328
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:59,240
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.  - Yes, you do.

1329
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:01,642
Been to the Camino Real Hotel lately?

1330
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:02,926
Open the safe.

1331
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:10,959
Staging area cleared up!

1332
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,081
Bring it through!

1333
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:26,201
Where's the money?

1334
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:28,730
You tell me where Deb is.

1335
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:31,526
She's gettin' her nails done. Where is the money?

1336
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,006
I don't know.

1337
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:36,883
All right, tell me what you do know.

1338
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:39,599
Well, your girl found out where the CIA

1339
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,919
was stashing the money right about when I did.

1340
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:43,319
And when I told her

1341
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:46,599
that she and I could get away with the money by setting you and Stigman up,

1342
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:47,726
she didn't even blink.

1343
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:49,519
Don't lie to me.

1344
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:51,682
Was she that unhappy, Bobby?

1345
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:59,725
Where is the money? Don't lie to me.

1346
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:02,651
You think I'd keep it here with you and Stigman still alive?

1347
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:04,285
Come on, Bobby.

1348
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,843
You gave it to her, didn't you?

1349
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:10,840
Didn't you?

1350
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:13,442
Commander. Back up.

1351
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:18,970
- Go, go, go, go!  - On your six!

1352
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:20,571
Move, move, move!

1353
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:28,886
All personnel evacuate the building.

1354
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:32,243
All personnel evacuate the building.

1355
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:37,079
Take the back, in that alley!

1356
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:38,520
Go to the front! Let's go!

1357
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:41,119
Hey!

1358
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:42,770
This way! Move!

1359
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:44,884
Come on, come on! Find him!

1360
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:30,927
Clear!

1361
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:32,641
Clear!

1362
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:03,721
You Okay?

1363
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:05,370
Come on, let's go.

1364
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:32,368
You okay, sir? Yeah, I'm fine.

1365
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:46,083
Work off the standpipe!

1366
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:50,080
This is really good barbecue.

1367
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:53,326
You don't want to regret not tryin' it.

1368
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:57,044
Why don't you stop wasting my time and just kill me?

1369
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:59,881
Even if Bobby was coming with the money,

1370
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,968
you'd still kill us both.

1371
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:07,686
But he's not coming.

1372
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:10,168
- He'll be here.  - No.

1373
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:12,281
He won't.

1374
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:15,327
You think he's just gonna let you die?

1375
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:20,208
You think it was a coincidence the Navy came looking for Bobby at my house?

1376
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:25,126
If I couldn't have Bobby, at least I'd have half of 43 million.

1377
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:30,607
You set up Bobby Beans.

1378
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:33,088
I wouldn't be coming for you either.

1379
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:34,720
Where's the money?

1380
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:37,008
Come on. I don't know.

1381
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:38,730
Gone, outta the country.

1382
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:41,360
It's certainly not on a Navy base, Papi.

1383
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:43,409
Where does that leave you?

1384
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,367
Exactly where I deserve to be.

1385
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:56,205
- Yeah.  - Bobby.

1386
01:25:58,240 --> 01:25:59,571
You're late.

1387
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:01,166
I got the money.

1388
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:03,049
I don't believe you.

1389
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:04,247
No, I got it.

1390
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:06,403
Believe me, I got it. I'll bring it to you.

1391
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:08,970
Where are you?

1392
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:10,891
Hi, Bobby.

1393
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:12,326
Debbie?

1394
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:16,201
Can he hear us?

1395
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:18,529
Just hang up the phone and run.

1396
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:20,045
Okay, listen to me.

1397
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:23,044
Tell him I got the money.

1398
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:24,571
Hang up the phone.

1399
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:29,599
It's not your fault. Just...

1400
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:30,601
Debbie.

1401
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:33,724
Tell him I have the money. Okay?

1402
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:36,764
And I know you know where the money is.

1403
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:39,361
Just tell him I have it.

1404
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:43,485
Debbie, listen to me.

1405
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:45,131
I'm sorry.

1406
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:49,009
I really meant to love you.

1407
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:50,446
Debbie.

1408
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:56,610
Where are you? Debbie, where are you?

1409
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:01,402
Where are you? Debbie?

1410
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:02,926
Hello?

1411
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:04,407
Hello?

1412
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:12,841
Hello?

1413
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:17,805
Hello? Debbie? Uh...

1414
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:24,481
Wait a minute, I got the money.

1415
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:42,199
What'd they say? What'd the Admiral say?

1416
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:45,119
What'd the Admiral say? Admiral washed his hands of the whole thing.

1417
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:46,439
Navy turned their back.

1418
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:47,680
Where's the money?

1419
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:51,679
There was no money, Stig.

1420
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:53,479
What? There was no money.

1421
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:54,839
'Course there is. I gave Quince the money.

1422
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:57,525
Right, and Quince gave it to Deb, and Deb is dead.

1423
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:01,206
Papi killed her.

1424
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:06,839
Fuck him.

1425
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:08,479
Let's go down to Mexico.

1426
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:11,241
We'll lure 'em all down, then take every one of 'em out. Kill 'em all.

1427
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:12,801
And then what?

1428
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:15,359
Well, at least Quince and Papi'd be dead.

1429
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,679
And then what?

1430
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:17,999
Oh, you just wanna let 'em skate?

1431
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,039
You don't get it, do ya, Stig?

1432
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:21,599
I mean, God bless you, you still think there's some kinda code.

1433
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,199
There is no code.

1434
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:26,239
You followed every order the Navy gave you, they kicked you in the teeth.

1435
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:27,559
There is no code, Stig.

1436
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:30,399
No one fights for the Navy, okay? It's not about the Navy.

1437
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:32,448
You fight for the guy that's fighting next to you.

1438
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:35,559
That doesn't mean anything to you?

1439
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:37,324
I'm goin' to Mexico.

1440
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:41,999
And just so you know, my code saved your life.

1441
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,719
There's three inches between your heart and your shoulder.

1442
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:45,722
My bullet goes three inches left, you'd be dead.

1443
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:46,919
And I wouldn't be here.

1444
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:49,400
'Cause Quince only decided to kill me because I let you live.

1445
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:52,279
What, you think I missed, huh?

1446
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:54,487
Is that what you think? You think I missed?

1447
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:57,009
When have you ever seen me miss?

1448
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:01,841
You stay here. I'm goin' to Mexico.

1449
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,164
Our deal still stand?

1450
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:11,121
I give you the money, I walk away clean?

1451
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:26,079
Hola. Looks like you had a banner morning.

1452
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,684
You better have my money.

1453
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,365
Right here. Every penny.

1454
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:31,239
Where's Bobby?

1455
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:33,399
We had a philosophical fallin' out.

1456
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:34,970
Open your trunk.

1457
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:38,039
I just want your word that you and your boys, Ferret Nose Julio, all of 'em,

1458
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:39,480
you'll help me kill Commander Quince.

1459
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:41,165
Who's Commander Quince?

1460
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:44,161
That's him.

1461
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:54,439
Mr. Stigman, you promised me $43 million

1462
01:31:54,440 --> 01:31:56,119
for killin' everyone on this ranch.

1463
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:57,121
Got the money right here, sir.

1464
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:59,319
Thing is, I promised Papi the $43 million, too,

1465
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:01,079
so I'm afraid you two are gonna have to duke it out.

1466
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:03,679
Maybe he and I'll just kill you instead and split the money.

1467
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:04,727
What do you say, Papi?

1468
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:07,719
50% of 40 million?

1469
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:09,484
Better than 100% dead, right?

1470
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:12,410
He'll double-cross you. Minute your back is turned, bullet in the head.

1471
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:16,011
50-50.

1472
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:18,239
The guy up on the roof says 60-40.

1473
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:20,242
He ain't got a trustworthy bone in his body.

1474
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:21,964
I came back, didn't I?

1475
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:54,364
Fuckin' CIA.

1476
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:57,883
Red rover, red rover.

1477
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:02,999
Whoever's got my 43.125 million better come the fuck on out.

1478
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,570
You offer him the money, too?

1479
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:05,839
I didn't call him.

1480
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:07,251
It's in the trunk!

1481
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:08,885
Why the fuck did you tell him that?

1482
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:11,640
Thank you, Commander.

1483
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:14,879
Mr. Stigman, come on out and open the trunk.

1484
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:16,450
Nice and slow, now.

1485
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:29,881
Well, what do we got here?

1486
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,729
Sounds like a Mexican wedding.

1487
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:55,922
Is that my '64 Impala?

1488
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:57,846
That's correct.

1489
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:00,126
I told you.

1490
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:02,719
I know a guy.

1491
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:03,767
Now,

1492
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:06,287
who wants to see $43 million?

1493
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:12,286
For a minute there, I thought you had me chasing my tail.

1494
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:15,521
You want to count it?

1495
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:18,119
If you're shortin' me, I know where to find you.

1496
01:34:18,120 --> 01:34:19,399
So we're good?

1497
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:20,639
Did I not give you my word?

1498
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:21,641
That's right.

1499
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:23,649
Then don't treat me like an asshole.

1500
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:25,006
I'll try my best.

1501
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:31,279
You and Mr. Stigman are free to go.

1502
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:32,399
Yes, sir.

1503
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:34,079
I trust you can find your own way home?

1504
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:35,119
That's right.

1505
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:36,559
- What're you doing, Bobby?  - Let's go.

1506
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:38,199
I'm not gonna let him get away with the money.

1507
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:39,599
Let's go. I hate these daggone teeth.

1508
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:40,759
They're not just gonna let us go.

1509
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:42,559
- I got a plan.  - Hey, I got my M-16.

1510
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:44,999
I got my grenade launcher, I got my M-4. Let's do this shit.

1511
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,319
I got a plan. I'm capable of coming up with a plan.

1512
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:48,599
Well, it better be a goddamn good one.

1513
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:49,759
It's a good plan.

1514
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:50,966
Make it rain.

1515
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:25,359
That was your plan? To blow up $43 million?

1516
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:27,839
Yeah, that's why it's a brilliant plan. Nobody expected it.

1517
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:30,401
Go.

1518
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:04,365
Come on, move it!

1519
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:08,166
Dumb assholes! Move it!

1520
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:22,921
You comin'?

1521
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:32,245
Go ahead, I'll be right behind you.

1522
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:33,399
Don't miss.

1523
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:34,731
I never miss!

1524
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:42,407
Told ya.

1525
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,241
Stig! Stig!

1526
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:21,919
Don't do it. Don't do it.

1527
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:22,921
Playtime's over.

1528
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,244
No more fucking around.

1529
01:37:26,360 --> 01:37:27,486
Now,

1530
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:29,329
drop your weapon.

1531
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:31,799
Tell Mr. Stigman to do the same.

1532
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:32,961
You tell him.

1533
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:36,319
It's real simple.

1534
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:38,846
We can all make a deal or we can all die.

1535
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:40,519
I'm not making any deals.

1536
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:42,319
Talk to your man, Bobby.

1537
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:43,759
Be the smart one.

1538
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:46,639
You think Tres Cruces is the only stash we got?

1539
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:50,239
We got 20 more. We got money everywhere.

1540
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:51,919
You're not gonna change a damn thing.

1541
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:52,921
Stig?

1542
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:54,401
Yeah?

1543
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:57,161
You're my people, right?

1544
01:37:58,960 --> 01:37:59,961
That's correct.

1545
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:14,881
You good?

1546
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:17,131
Never better.

1547
01:38:17,560 --> 01:38:19,359
We're not people, though.

1548
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:20,646
This makes us family.

1549
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:22,851
All right, brother.

1550
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:24,799
Hey, se?or Einstein,

1551
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:27,239
you're looking kind of fucked up sittin' there, man.

1552
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:28,241
You all right?

1553
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:34,282
Mow my lawn.

1554
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:47,959
Well, you know what was so cool?

1555
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:49,919
You rolling in on that '64 Impala.

1556
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:51,519
I mean, you looked badass, man.

1557
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:52,759
Yeah, that's right.

1558
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:54,999
Listen, one more thing, one more thing.

1559
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:56,081
What?

1560
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:57,440
Give me your gun.

1561
01:38:58,080 --> 01:38:59,479
Give me your gun.

1562
01:38:59,480 --> 01:39:00,559
You're not serious.

1563
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:01,561
Yes, I am.

1564
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:02,921
Thank you.

1565
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:05,119
You're really gonna do this after everything we've been through?

1566
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:07,079
Arm or leg?

1567
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:08,679
This is not gonna make you feel better.

1568
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:11,719
I'm thinking leg. Because leg, there's more flesh, there's not as much bone.

1569
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:12,999
The arm will...

1570
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,559
You know what you are? You are a petty...

1571
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:17,086
Fucking son of a bitch!

1572
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:19,119
Hurts, doesn't it? You know you coulda killed me?

1573
01:39:19,120 --> 01:39:21,119
Is that right? Three more inches to the left.

1574
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:22,199
Don't even say it, man.

1575
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:23,679
You wouldn't be winking at waitresses anymore.

1576
01:39:23,680 --> 01:39:25,719
I'd still wink, I just wouldn't be able to do anything about it.

1577
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:26,919
You know me, I don't miss.

1578
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:29,599
- I never miss.  - When's the last time you saw me miss?

1579
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:32,251
You gonna carry my ass all the way the fuck home.

1580
01:39:32,360 --> 01:39:34,283
Oh, shit, man. This burns.

1581
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:35,771
That's correct.

1582
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,839
You know, I shot you when I didn't know who you were.

1583
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:41,319
Before we were family.

1584
01:39:41,320 --> 01:39:42,399
There's a difference.

1585
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:44,767
But we're family now. I shot you because I know who you are.

1586
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:46,086
That ain't right.

1587
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:05,804
They definitely got the look.

1588
01:40:05,960 --> 01:40:09,760
Assholes and windshield sunglasses, practically CIA uniform.

1589
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:11,765
Can I get you boys anything else?

1590
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:14,086
Are your doughnuts any good?

1591
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:17,566
Tell you the truth, they're pretty lousy.

1592
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:19,882
Can't tell you how happy we are to hear that.

1593
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:23,126
You take care.

1594
01:40:23,320 --> 01:40:24,479
I saw that.

1595
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:25,959
- Saw what?  - You winked.

1596
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:27,530
- That's a twitch.  - Yeah, right.

1597
01:40:32,680 --> 01:40:34,599
You know, for a guy who just blew up $43 million,

1598
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:36,719
all of a sudden, you are a very generous tipper.

1599
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:39,007
Who said I blew up $43 million?

1600
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:41,919
What are you sayin'?

1601
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:43,239
I'm not sayin' anything. What are you hearing?

1602
01:40:43,240 --> 01:40:45,239
I'm hearin' somethin'. You're sayin' somethin'.

1603
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:47,279
Well, if you're hearin' it, it's only because you're hearin' it,

1604
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:49,799
not 'cause I'm sayin' it.

1605
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:51,290
How much did you keep?

1606
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:53,486
Two million?

1607
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:56,159
That's like one each.

1608
01:40:56,160 --> 01:40:57,479
So now you get half?

1609
01:40:57,480 --> 01:40:59,608
- Well, I shot half the guys.  - So?

1610
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:02,211
Two million?
