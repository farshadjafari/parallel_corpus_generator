1
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:48,325
46-99402.

2
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,746
Transfer to 53-01138.

3
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,295
What'd we just do?

4
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,624
The Republican Party just made a
generous donation to the Black Panthers.

5
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:06,468
Farm out.
Right arm.

6
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,921
Who's next?
Let's see.

7
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:13,433
Richard Nixon's personal
checking account is in here.

8
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,306
Ooh, this is a challenge.

9
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:19,106
Marty, we have to find somebody
truly worthy to give his money to.

10
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:21,400
How about...

11
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,773
The National Association
to Legalize Marijuana.

12
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,695
Perfect.
How much should he give?

13
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:29,776
He's a generous man. I'd say, all he's got.
God, I'm hungry!

14
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:34,989
Marty, you are sure we will not
get into trouble for this?

15
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:37,791
Cosmo, trust me.

16
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:48,256
Posit, the phone company
has too much money.

17
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:51,009
Oh, good one.
Consequence?

18
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:52,431
They're corrupt. Result?

19
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,806
The system perpetuates itself
at the expense of the people.

20
00:02:55,926 --> 00:03:00,181
Conclusion? Ma Bell needs
to donate some money.

21
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,436
We're gonna change the world,
Marty.

22
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:06,612
I just wish we could get
course credit for this. Gosh!

23
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,406
You gotta eat.
You want some food?

24
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,775
Loser goes.

25
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,036
I never lose.

26
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:24,000
Pepperoni pizza, please,
shaken, not stirred.

27
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:27,671
Power to the people, Cos.
Power to the people, Marty.

28
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:33,718
One cannot trust anybody
these days.

29
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,471
No, don't do this.

30
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:57,256
Marty! Marty!

31
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:00,016
Marty! Marty!

32
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,526
Martin.

33
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:20,078
Martin.

34
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,244
Martin. Martin.

35
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,628
It's time.

36
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,714
How're we doing?

37
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:39,640
Carl's in position on the fire escape.
Mother's in the cable vault.

38
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:42,888
Whistler, he's reading.

39
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,602
We're up.

40
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,405
What's with the lobby?
Still just the one guard.

41
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:59,527
Okay, Mother, try the ones
coming off the blue trunk.

42
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,207
Nope.

43
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:11,581
Try the ones coming off the white
trunk, Mother. These don't sound right.

44
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,126
<i>Oh no.</i>

45
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:18,671
We've even got photos
of the guy leaving the embassy

46
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,222
through the
back service entrance.

47
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,763
Hey, Crease, you on?

48
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:26,636
Yeah, I'm on.

49
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,973
<i>Were you still in CIA in '72?</i>

50
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,774
Yeah, why?

51
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:33,695
Did you know the deputy
director of planning

52
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,401
was down in Managua, Nicaragua,
the day before the earthquake?

53
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,742
Now, what are you saying? The CIA
caused the Managua earthquake?

54
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,658
Well, I can't prove it, but...

55
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,995
I can't talk to that guy.

56
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,420
Hold on, Mother, go back one.

57
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,294
Bingo!

58
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,002
Securing bridge clips.

59
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,636
Preparing
to sever master alarm circuit.

60
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:06,427
Five, four...

61
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:10,147
<i>I looked in that box just now.</i>

62
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,566
<i>There wasn't anything there.</i>

63
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,571
<i>I know how you feel.
Do you?</i>

64
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,857
Nice bank?

65
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,693
You wouldn't believe
what I had to go through

66
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,353
just to get a safe deposit box.

67
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:34,439
Oh, shit. We're getting
too old for this.

68
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:40,528
<i>MAN: Westguard Security.</i> Yeah, I
got a fire at Centurion Bank.

69
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:41,855
<i>Yeah, we got the alarm.</i>

70
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:45,112
<i>Are there any secondary indications?
Smoke or flame?</i>

71
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,326
No.

72
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:48,779
<i>It's probably a false alarm.</i>

73
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:52,287
<i>We've been getting them in your
area all night. See if it resets.</i>

74
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,083
Oh man, I don't know.

75
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,299
Sure you know which one to cut?

76
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,097
Yes! The alarm's
always the green one.

77
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,267
Good, Carl.

78
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,742
Hey, man, I'm not waiting any longer.
I'm calling the fire...

79
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:21,403
Oh. It stopped. Sorry.

80
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:24,027
<i>Hey, no problem. And, son?</i>

81
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,231
Sir?

82
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:27,484
Good work.

83
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,160
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

84
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,743
All yours, Bish.

85
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,919
So, how much do you want?

86
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:51,967
80,000.90,000. 100,000.

87
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,518
Okay.

88
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:57,097
May I ask why you're closing
your account with us today, sir?

89
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:01,902
Well, I just had this weird feeling
that my money wasn't safe here anymore.

90
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:25,296
Gentlemen, your communication
lines are vulnerable.

91
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,628
Fire exits need to be monitored.

92
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,963
Your rent-a-cops
are a tad under trained.

93
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,424
Outside of that, everything
seems to be just fine.

94
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:34,805
You'll be getting our full report
and analysis in a few days.

95
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,807
But first, who's got my check?

96
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:42,609
So, people hire you
to break into their places

97
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:46,314
to make sure no one
can break into their places?

98
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,403
It's a living.

99
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,491
Not a very good one.

100
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,073
Thank you.

101
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,334
Is that him?

102
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:06,212
Oh yeah, that's him.

103
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:14,842
Who's got the report
for the bank sneak?

104
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,972
I'm gonna type it up later.

105
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,098
You are?

106
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,897
We haven't paid the typist since
January, so it's either me or Whistler.

107
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,098
Better Whistler.

108
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,025
We've got customers.

109
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,602
Shoes?

110
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,062
Expensive.

111
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,027
Look busy, guys-

112
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:34,611
Mr. Bishop. Dick Gordon.
Hi.

113
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,037
Buddy Wallace.
Hi.

114
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,832
We've heard a lot of
great things about you.

115
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,830
They're all true.
Thanks, Carl.

116
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,411
Gentlemen, why don't we go
to the conference room?

117
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,893
You can tell us
how we can help you.

118
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,038
Good.

119
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,378
Okay. Thank you.

120
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:55,219
So here...

121
00:11:55,298 --> 00:12:00,054
Before we begin, there's
something we'd like to clear up.

122
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:04,312
Most firms of this type are staffed
with ex-law enforcement types.

123
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,017
But your team, it's...

124
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,852
I know, kind of different.

125
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:10,064
Yes, you are.

126
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:19,372
Darryl Roskow,
also known as "Mother."

127
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,416
Eighteen months at Dannemora
for breaking and entering.

128
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:26,087
Yeah, he was framed. But he's got
the best hands in the business.

129
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,841
Carl Arbogast, age 19.

130
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,840
Caught breaking into the Oakland
City School District computer

131
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,466
to change his grades.

132
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,090
I know. We're the ones
who caught him.

133
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:40,518
Irwin Emery,
also known as "Whistler."

134
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,938
He had some little
problem with the phone company.

135
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,731
Sixty-two counts?

136
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,980
Okay, you want law enforcement?

137
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:51,233
How about Donald Crease? Twenty-two
year veteran of the CIA.

138
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:55,488
Terminated, 1987.
Why was that?

139
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,025
I don't know. I think maybe
a personality conflict.

140
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,119
Who are you guys?

141
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,448
Relax, Marty. We have to
check on these things.

142
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:04,580
It's just everybody on your team has had
some sort of problem in their past.

143
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:07,503
And then there's Martin Bishop.

144
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,667
He doesn't seem to have a past.

145
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,969
Sorry to waste your time, gentlemen.
I don't work for the government.

146
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,345
We know.

147
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,263
National Security Agency.

148
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:30,023
Oh, you're the guys I hear breathing
on the other end of my phone.

149
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:34,322
No, that's the FBI. We're not
chartered for domestic surveillance.

150
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:38,527
Oh, I see. You just overthrow
governments, set up friendly dictators.

151
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,486
No, that's the CIA.

152
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,250
We protect our government's
communications,

153
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,074
try to break
the other fellow's codes.

154
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,579
We're the good guys, Marty.

155
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:49,128
Gee, I can't tell you
what a relief that is, Dick.

156
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:53,049
All right, that's enough.
Let's go.

157
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:59,173
If you change your mind
call us at this number...

158
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,093
Mr. Brice.

159
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,468
Help me out?

160
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:47,555
Spare a quarter? Help me out. The
government's taken away my home.

161
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:49,435
Talk to him.

162
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,199
Well, if it isn't Robin Hood.

163
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:05,788
You know, I could've joined the NSA, but
they found out my parents were married.

164
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:10,664
Hey, hey, we're all friends here, right?
Easy, easy.

165
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,503
Want some coffee or something?

166
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,830
No.

167
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,711
Buddy, is that Janek's file?

168
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,919
Yeah, Janek's file.

169
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,595
This is a mathematician
named Dr. Gunter Janek.

170
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,890
Works at a think tank called
the Coolidge Institute.

171
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:27,310
Specializes in large number
theory, prime numbers, factoring.

172
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,103
Cryptography.
Very good.

173
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:32,432
Last month, the good doctor
gets a grant, $380,000.

174
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,483
Way out of profile
for a guy like that.

175
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,937
It's our job to be curious,
so we traced the money.

176
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,612
Guess where it comes from?

177
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:41,407
I know you're not gonna say Russia.
Yeah.

178
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:42,984
Give me a break.

179
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,320
We won, they lost, you know?
It's been in a couple of papers.

180
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,701
Yeah, we still spy on them.
They still spy on us.

181
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,454
We intercepted a fax
last week. Here.

182
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:53,707
They're making some kind of box,
a little black box.

183
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:57,836
The project's called Setec Astronomy.
We don't know what Setec stands for.

184
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,955
Security technology...
Sensor techniques, who knows?

185
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:04,009
It may be nothing or it may be something.
And we need to know.

186
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,968
Your job is to find that little black box.
Let us take a look at it.

187
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,052
Yeah. No way.

188
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:13,603
Sorry, Marty. We don't
have a lot of choice here.

189
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:16,313
Do it yourself.

190
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,392
We can't.
Why not?

191
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:19,984
By law, we're not allowed or equipped
to do this kind of operation.

192
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,315
Then get the FBI.

193
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,492
Yeah, right, the FBI.

194
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:28,162
The FBI can't work for us without
approval from a congressional committee.

195
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,205
We don't have the time.
So, why me?

196
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:31,328
Frankly, because we...

197
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,909
Yeah, frankly.

198
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,583
Marty, sit down, please.

199
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,759
Frankly, because
it's kind of illegal.

200
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,954
You've managed to stay
underground more than 20 years.

201
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,383
You know how not to get caught.

202
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,181
We know you can
keep your mouth shut.

203
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:50,135
Job pays $175,000,
payable on delivery.

204
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:53,597
You can distribute it
among the poor, if you like.

205
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:55,852
Pass.

206
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,309
We also clean up your record.

207
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,192
Quash the outstanding
warrant for your arrest.

208
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:03,232
Your pal Cosmo got 12 years, and that was
without flight to evade prosecution.

209
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:06,534
We all know what happened
to him in there.

210
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,457
If I say no?

211
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,747
Don't say no.

212
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,039
What good would you do
anybody in prison?

213
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,885
I don't believe this. You
lied to us all these years.

214
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,053
Even lied to us about your name.

215
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,129
Sorry, okay?

216
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,716
I'm sorry, but when you're
wanted by the feds,

217
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,018
you don't go around
telling everybody.

218
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:35,393
We're not everybody, Martin. We're
your partners. You tell us.

219
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,814
Fine.

220
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,026
Exactly why was it
you had to leave the CIA?

221
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,648
We all have our little
secrets, don't we?

222
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,367
Look, you guys have
a decision to make.

223
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:53,157
This is not a test. The penetration
is live. The target is unaware.

224
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:56,330
Sneaking a foreign intelligence
service that might kill us

225
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,535
to keep us out
is not what we do.

226
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,871
The probable level of security
is very low.

227
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:05,585
But if you guys don't want to take that
chance just to keep me out of jail...

228
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,670
Fine. I understand.
Don't do it.

229
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:13,222
Well, Bish, I can't speak for the other
guys, but I'm in it for the money.

230
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:14,928
I don't care if you go to jail.

231
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,763
Me neither. I'm in.

232
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:21,484
Could we maybe just go back to
the "they might kill us" part?

233
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:22,981
If I thought
that was likely to happen,

234
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,232
I wouldn't bring this to you.

235
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:25,438
But there is a risk.

236
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,990
It pays $175,000!

237
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,781
I'm in.

238
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:41,751
You guys'll be chalk outlines without me.
All right. What do we need?

239
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:45,462
Okay. We start with a very light
surveillance. Level three.

240
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,339
First sign of baby-sitters,
we back off.

241
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:49,967
Now, this guy's giving a lecture
tomorrow at U.C. in the afternoon.

242
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:53,300
I'm gonna be there and check him out.
Okay? Any questions?

243
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,263
Okay, let's do it.

244
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:58,722
For the lecture, you wanna take
Whistler or do you want me?

245
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:03,271
No, that's okay.
I thought I'd ask Liz.

246
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,028
Who's this?

247
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,111
Sort of an old friend.

248
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:54,110
Practice! Practice, practice!

249
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,282
Hi.

250
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:02,285
We're not getting back together.

251
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,166
Did I say anything?
You will.

252
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:05,963
I'm here on business, Liz.

253
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,631
Bishop,
you don't have a business.

254
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:10,051
You have a club.
It's a boys' club.

255
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:13,346
You have a little clubhouse. You
probably have a secret handshake.

256
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:15,048
Liz, I need your help.

257
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:18,055
I will not be dragged back
into your world.

258
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,182
I have a new group
of gifted children now,

259
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:23,265
and I like the fact
that they're under 30.

260
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,394
Excuse me.

261
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:27,272
There's a mathematician named Gunter Janek.
You know him?

262
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,274
I've read him.
Now go away.

263
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,105
He's giving a master lecture
at 3:30...

264
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,907
How nice for him.

265
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,405
I thought I'd buy you
dinner after.

266
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,906
I am not going out with you.

267
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:41,241
This isn't a date, dummy. This is a
scientific exploration, a tutorial.

268
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,166
I need you...

269
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,833
To explain it to me.

270
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,626
Read a book.

271
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:54,295
They found me, Liz.

272
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,882
The government found me.

273
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:02,436
They offered me a deal. If I take
their offer, they clear my record,

274
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,684
and I can get my name back.

275
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:17,118
You and I
are not getting back together.

276
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:19,412
Hey, don't flatter yourself.

277
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,536
Pick me up at 3:00.

278
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,082
Yes!

279
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:31,090
While the number field sieve is
the best method currently known,

280
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:37,468
there exists an intriguing possibility
for a far more elegant approach.

281
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:39,807
This guy's good.

282
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:40,883
Shh!

283
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:46,022
...over the rationals and, hence,
contained in a single cyclotomic field.

284
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:49,396
Using the Artin map, we might
induce homomorphisms...

285
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,772
You seeing anybody?
Shh!

286
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:57,700
These maps could then be used to combine
splitting information from all the...

287
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:02,076
This isn’t just about large number theory.
It's about cryptography.

288
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,498
Oh? You mean codes?

289
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:08,752
I mean unbreakable codes.

290
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:13,462
It would be a breakthrough
of Gaussian proportions,

291
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:20,140
and allow us to acquire the solution in
a dramatically more efficient manner.

292
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,092
Are you seeing...
Shh!

293
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:26,019
Such an approach
is purely theoretical.

294
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:28,644
So far, no one has been able
to accomplish

295
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:32,977
such constructions yet.

296
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:37,148
The numbers are so unbelievably big,

297
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:40,235
all the computers in the world
could not break them down.

298
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:44,493
But maybe,
just maybe there's a shortcut.

299
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:47,457
I'll bet you anything
he's found it.

300
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:51,003
If he has, you're in over your head.
I'll get my coat.

301
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:54,673
Numbers themselves
may be our best tools.

302
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:57,797
Maybe able to see things in
other numbers that we can't.

303
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,550
Martin.

304
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,840
Martin,
how wonderful to see you.

305
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:05,301
Hi, Greg. How are you?
Is it not fabulous?

306
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:09,560
Today I can in public come and learn
your scientists' new secrets.

307
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:13,063
Alas, I did not understand one bit
of what he was talking about.

308
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:16,442
At least I...
Oh! Goodness, can it be?

309
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:17,563
Hmm?

310
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,732
Oh, yeah.
Elizabeth.

311
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,488
She's dying
to talk to you too, Greg.

312
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,945
Excuse me. Elizabeth.

313
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,739
Elizabeth.

314
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,116
Hello, Greg.

315
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:31,452
Elizabeth and Martin.

316
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:35,039
My heart leaps like gazelle to
see you back together again.

317
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:37,545
Tell it to stop leaping.
We are not back together.

318
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:40,094
No? Oh, what a pity.

319
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:44,928
Wait. I have smashing idea.
Martin! Martin!

320
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:49,520
Kiev string quartet plays at the
consulate on Thursday night.

321
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:52,686
You will be my guests.

322
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:54,733
Really, Greg, I wouldn't
know how to repay you.

323
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:59,773
Martin, now that our countries
are such good friends,

324
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:03,826
perhaps you will finally be able
to do occasional favor for me?

325
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:06,074
Gregor, you are shameless.

326
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,406
See you Thursday night.

327
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:09,581
What?

328
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:13,376
New title.
Cultural attaché.

329
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,038
Unbelievable!

330
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:20,467
Last few years has been very confusing
for people in my line of work.

331
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:21,885
I'll bet.

332
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:28,141
I don't care what anybody says
about the "New World Order."

333
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:30,060
I don't trust that guy.

334
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,604
Who, Greg? He's harmless.

335
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:34,765
Let the number itself tell us...

336
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:43,699
If you'll excuse me,
I have some work.

337
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:46,493
You're gonna follow him,
aren't you?

338
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,488
Liz, I...
It's okay. I'll get a cab.

339
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,539
Can I call you?

340
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,248
Just be careful.

341
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:21,190
Janek just got in
the elevator. Going up.

342
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,863
We will be ready for him.

343
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,030
How's the audio?

344
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:26,359
Good. Mother's pretty close.

345
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:29,662
He's just wearing
four safety belts this time.

346
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:32,039
What, no parachute?

347
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:35,618
All righty. Entry and lights on.

348
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:37,411
Describe it.

349
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,379
Looks like a workroom.

350
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,457
You got yourself a bench
with a soldering gun,

351
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,510
two spools of wire
and a magnifying lamp.

352
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:47,179
Yeah, sounds like he's making something.

353
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,973
Then a desk...

354
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:51,426
Mmm-hmm.

355
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,145
Telephone, lamp,
answering machine.

356
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,349
Ajar of pencils,
but no little black box.

357
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:01,276
It's gotta be there somewhere.
What's he doing?

358
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,649
He's logging on the computer.

359
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:09,493
Oh, this is good.

360
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,240
He's gonna type in his password,

361
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,322
and we're gonna
get a clear shot.

362
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,592
<i>Oh! Dr. Rhyzkov,
good evening.</i>

363
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,383
Hey, let's get an I.D.
on Dr. Rhyzkov.

364
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:30,135
She was with him this afternoon.

365
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:33,263
She was trying to tell him
something, and it was making him...

366
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:35,310
<i>Oh, Gunter.</i>

367
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:38,932
<i>Let's do what we did
in Mexico City.</i>

368
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:42,359
I didn't know you could
do that in Mexico City.

369
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,856
Mr. Bishop,
do you mind if I take a look?

370
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:45,108
Carl.

371
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:46,313
Grow up.

372
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:51,451
Let me see.

373
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:52,949
<i>Oh, Gunter.</i>

374
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:54,909
<i>Oh, Gunter.</i>

375
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,039
<i>Oh, Gunter.</i>

376
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:06,376
<i>Elena, really!
I must finish my work.</i>

377
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:12,506
Okay, back to work.

378
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:16,973
Nope, here we go. Now we're
gonna get our password.

379
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:20,727
<i>I leave message here on
service but you do not call.</i>

380
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,316
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

381
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:25,610
Get out of the way.
She's in the way.

382
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:30,775
I don't believe this.

383
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:33,406
<i>It's just, I have this work.</i>

384
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,915
<i>I give you something
to work, baby.</i>

385
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,540
Okay. <i>Just for</i>
a <i>little while.</i>

386
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,380
<i>Oh, Gunter.</i>

387
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:50,506
What's going on?

388
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:52,054
Oh, nothing.

389
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:59,429
<i>Elena, really!
I must finish my work.</i>

390
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:04,563
<i>I leave message here on
service but you do not call.</i>

391
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,894
Maybe there's a frame or
two where she doesn't block it.

392
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:08,650
I'll blow it up.

393
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:12,275
Hey. Who's Rhyzkov?

394
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:16,533
Dr. Elena Rhyzkov, visiting
professor from Czechoslovakia,

395
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:19,786
senior research fellow
in astrophysics.

396
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:20,866
Bingo.

397
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:24,123
Setec Astronomy,
whatever that is.

398
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:28,833
<i>I leave message here on
service but you do not call.</i>

399
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,380
There.

400
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,512
W, G...

401
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,340
Looks like the H.

402
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,141
Where do you get H?
Next to the L.

403
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:39,218
H isn't next to the L.

404
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:41,053
Guys, do it again.

405
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:48,436
<i>I leave message here on
service but you do not call.</i>

406
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:53,775
<i>...message here on service
but you do not call.</i>

407
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,985
Okay, that's definitely W, G.

408
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:59,322
Definitely not.
No, that's a V.

409
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,906
She's in the way.

410
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:04,493
Fellows, Janek's little
black box is on his desk

411
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:07,375
between the pencil jar
and the lamp.

412
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:12,168
Whistler, I hate to tell you
this, but you're blind.

413
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,755
Play the tape back again.

414
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,465
But you can't even see anything.

415
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:20,425
Don't look. Listen.

416
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:23,179
Play it back.

417
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:27,850
<i>I leave message here on
service but you do not...</i>

418
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,526
He's got a service.

419
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:33,565
What's he need
an answering machine for?

420
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:38,611
There's our little black box.

421
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:50,381
Okay, boss. This LTX-71 concealable mike

422
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,056
is part of the same system
that NASA used

423
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:54,673
when they faked
the Apollo moon landings.

424
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:58,096
Had the astronauts broadcast
around the world from a soundstage

425
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:00,469
at Norton Air Force Base
in San Bernardino, California.

426
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:04,474
So, it worked for them. It shouldn't
give us too many problems.

427
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:06,055
Thanks.

428
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,683
You didn't have a delivery?

429
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,006
I should have the invoice here.

430
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:14,484
No delivery is scheduled. They
didn't have anything on record.

431
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,065
Did my wife
drop a cake off for me?

432
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:18,321
There's no cake back here.

433
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,743
Surprise party for Marge
on the second floor.

434
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,035
She was supposed
to drop a cake off.

435
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:22,738
I don't know about it.

436
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:25,324
There she is, late as usual.

437
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:29,002
It states here that I am to
deliver 36 boxes of Liquid Drano

438
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,169
to this address.

439
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:34,500
I don't care what that says. You're
not on the list. You can't get in.

440
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:35,709
I might lose my job.

441
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,341
That's not my problem.
Now beat it.

442
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,847
I can't reach my card.
Could you buzz this, please?

443
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:42,424
Just buzz it.
I can't reach my card.

444
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,009
Wait one minute.

445
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,719
We're late for the party
on the second floor.

446
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,645
Push the goddamned buzzer,
will you?

447
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:49,931
Thanks.

448
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:20,637
Anybody remember how to defeat
an electronic key pad?

449
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:25,301
Don't even joke about that, Martin.
Those things are impossible.

450
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:28,137
Think I'm joking? Looks
like they just put it in.

451
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,813
Oh boy.

452
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:34,772
Here, maybe this might help.

453
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:37,855
Old buddy of mine, was in
Desert Storm, sent it to me.

454
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:40,191
'Course, he was
on the other side.

455
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:44,862
<i>Come on, Crease. There's got
to be a way around these things.</i>

456
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:46,822
All right, all right.

457
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,503
This might work.

458
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,044
Yeah. Yeah.

459
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,343
Yeah. Right.

460
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,221
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah.

461
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,307
Yeah.

462
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:10,683
Okay. I'll give it a shot.

463
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,109
That worked.

464
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,468
Got it.

465
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:47,929
Gunter? You're...

466
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:49,329
Oh, God, no.
Here you go, come on.

467
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,886
Hey, nice to see you.

468
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:54,514
Who the hell is that?

469
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:56,396
Battle stations.

470
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,227
Monitor the audio.
Grab the mike.

471
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,438
Okay-

472
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,774
I'm gonna remove my hand now.
Please, do not scream.

473
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:06,656
I promise nothing is
going to happen to you.

474
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:07,827
Okay?

475
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:09,200
Mmm-hmm.

476
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,207
Who are you?

477
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,923
He's a P.I.

478
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,198
You're a private investigator.

479
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,377
I'm a private investigator.

480
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,387
But why? Who hired you?

481
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:29,216
Huh?

482
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:30,801
Who hired you?

483
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,265
Mrs. Janek.

484
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,272
There is not Mrs. Janek.

485
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:40,110
Yeah?

486
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:42,946
You got us stumped.

487
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:49,328
Oh yeah? Who do you think paid for
your little love jaunt to Mexico City?

488
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:55,034
That was good.

489
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,586
Velma, Velma Janek.

490
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:01,916
She lives in Montreal where she handles
her family's real estate holdings,

491
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,420
vast real estate holdings.

492
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,800
Farms, banks, shopping malls.
Two shopping malls.

493
00:34:07,571 --> 00:34:09,732
She supports Gunter but figured
he was cheating on her,

494
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,884
and that's why she hired me.

495
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:13,810
Bastard liar!

496
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:18,182
I'll kill him!
Oh, no, no, no!

497
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:20,939
No! No, no, don't. Get a hold
of yourself, Dr. Rhyzkov.

498
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,815
Get a hold of yourself.

499
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:25,189
You gotta not tell him you know.
Ha!

500
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:29,075
We weren't here. We didn't talk.
You don't know me.

501
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,244
You don't know anything
about a wife.

502
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,913
You just give me
one good reason why.

503
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:38,415
All right,
I'll give you a reason.

504
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:42,506
Give you a really good reason.

505
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:47,670
It's just what she would
want you to do.

506
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:50,840
It's just what she
wants you to do.

507
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,675
I don't understand.

508
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:57,770
Yeah, sometimes
I don't understand myself.

509
00:34:57,846 --> 00:35:00,770
Here, look, I might lose
my license for this.

510
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:05,111
My client is a vindictive,
bitter woman.

511
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:08,281
She's been withholding marital
favors from Gunter for years,

512
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,949
and now she's out to ruin him.

513
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:12,369
And she's
using you to get to her.

514
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:15,664
And she's using
me to get to you.

515
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:20,585
I know that's confusing, but don't
you see what's happening here?

516
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,958
You and me, we're just pawns
in this ugly little game.

517
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:24,130
Pawns.

518
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:30,212
If you love him...

519
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:36,059
If you really love him...

520
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,562
Then just keep on loving him.

521
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:41,477
And never let him know

522
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:45,231
that you know what he thinks
you don't know you know.

523
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,437
You know?

524
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:49,572
And give him head
whenever he wants.

525
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:52,197
Give him help.

526
00:35:53,902 --> 00:36:00,410
Be a beacon in his sad and lonely life.
Can you do that for Gunter?

527
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:03,787
Yes, yes, I can, I can.

528
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,292
Okay, good.

529
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:07,924
Now get out of here.

530
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,426
Give him head?

531
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,761
Be a beacon?

532
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:56,885
But the key meeting
took place July 1, 1958,

533
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:59,388
when the Air Force brought this
space visitor to the White House

534
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,708
for an interview with President Eisenhower.
And Ike said,

535
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,388
"Look, give us your technology."

536
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:04,973
"We'll give you all
the cow lips you want."

537
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,935
Don't listen to this man.
He's certifiable.

538
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,940
Your husband knows about cattle
mutilations. He's ex-CIA.

539
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,066
He's touched.

540
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:13,319
He knows the government's
been suppressing for years.

541
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:15,742
Understood, understood.

542
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:19,788
One thing I don't quite get
though is you and Cosmo,

543
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:23,413
you were taking all these
chances, all these big chances,

544
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,372
what for?

545
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:30,128
We were young.
And there was a war on.

546
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:35,254
It was a good way to meet girls.

547
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,508
I bet.

548
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:39,846
How come you didn't get caught?

549
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,058
I went out for pizza.

550
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:47,808
Then I went to Canada.

551
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,023
I was lucky. He wasn't.

552
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,734
Did he ever forgive you?

553
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:55,657
I hope so.

554
00:37:57,317 --> 00:37:58,694
He died in prison.

555
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:10,880
So, what are you guys gonna do
with your share of the money?

556
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:13,459
Don?

557
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:17,428
Well, we have never been
to Europe together.

558
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:18,505
That's right.

559
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:20,636
And we are going.

560
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,551
Madrid, Lisbon.

561
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:25,637
Athens. Oh, and Scotland.

562
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,937
And Tahiti.

563
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,686
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

564
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:30,229
Mother?

565
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,854
Well, you know, I've never
actually had a really cool car

566
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:36,440
that I could
fit comfortably into.

567
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:39,447
So I think
I'm gonna buy me a Winnebago

568
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:44,077
with a big kitchen,
water bed, big kitchen.

569
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,249
Carl?

570
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:51,208
I'd like to have a deep
relationship with a beautiful woman

571
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:54,086
who melts from the very
first time our eyes meet.

572
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:58,090
We're not
getting paid that much, Carl.

573
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:00,050
Well, you know,
someone like Liz.

574
00:39:01,807 --> 00:39:03,567
You're definitely
not getting paid that much.

575
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:04,638
Ooh! Uh-oh.

576
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:06,435
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

577
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:08,229
Whistler?

578
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:12,150
Peace on earth,
goodwill toward men.

579
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:13,522
Right On.

580
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:15,278
And women.

581
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,314
Hear, hear!

582
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:24,578
That's not a word, "scrunchy".

583
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:26,031
Scrunchy is not a word.

584
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:27,787
Scrunchy is a word.

585
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:29,951
Since when? You know what
happens to your face?

586
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,670
Please, it's not a word. Right
now your face is scrunchy.

587
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:35,749
All right. We gotta take it as a word.

588
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,224
It's better than "scrunchy."

589
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:47,473
I didn't invent the word.

590
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,478
- Carl.
- Yes.

591
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:52,227
What does it say where this is?

592
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:54,480
Hold on a second here.

593
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,856
"System out."

594
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:05,905
Guys, I really think you
should leave that thing alone.

595
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:11,498
Yeah, I know. I just wanted to
see something. Don't worry, Don.

596
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:14,584
How are they spelling Setec?

597
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,756
S-E-T-E-C. Setec.

598
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:21,044
Special extraterrestrial?

599
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,220
Earthling counter.

600
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:27,717
Does that make two, four, five.

601
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:32,348
And she begins to go,
and this one bull turns around

602
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,900
and looks at me,
like right dead in my eyes.

603
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,192
Setec.

604
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:38,610
What?

605
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,688
Setec Astronomy.

606
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:44,651
I just love it
when a man says that to me.

607
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,079
Setec doesn't mean anything.

608
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,872
Excuse me...

609
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:26,368
Carl, can you get me some cable
and that IO interface, please?

610
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:38,000
"Monterey's Coast."

611
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:43,251
Does "Monterey's Coast"
mean anything to you guys?

612
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:46,425
No.

613
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,350
Here, help me with this.

614
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:03,938
Carl, get the diagnostics.

615
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:13,456
How about "My Socrates Note"?

616
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:16,367
No.

617
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:17,668
Uh-uh.

618
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,966
No, I...

619
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,302
No. No.

620
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,988
Uh-huh. Got it.
Move to another one.

621
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,834
Mmm-hmm. Give me another one.

622
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:02,796
Stay in that quadrant.

623
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:15,101
It's kind of the same thing.
Try another quadrant.

624
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:17,678
Whoa.

625
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:21,269
Mother, what was that?
Go back one.

626
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:22,726
All right.

627
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:26,354
Holy cow.

628
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:30,616
What the hell is this?

629
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:48,130
"Too Many Secrets."

630
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:56,431
Bish, I think you
better come over here.

631
00:43:56,926 --> 00:43:58,928
Carl, got your
little black book?

632
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:00,058
Yes.

633
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:03,893
Give me the number for something
impossible to access.

634
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:07,645
Okay. What about this?

635
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:10,151
Federal Reserve transfer node,
Culpeper, Virginia.

636
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:11,323
Yeah, sure. Good luck.

637
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:13,493
Nine hundred billion
a day goes through there.

638
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:15,616
That'll do. Punch it in.

639
00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:17,572
Okay.

640
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:21,793
We won't get in.
It's encrypted.

641
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:29,592
See?

642
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,382
Mother, that last contact.

643
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:43,765
Look at this, boys.

644
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:48,277
Anybody want to shut down
the Federal Reserve?

645
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:50,980
Hey, don't screw around
with that thing!

646
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,110
Wait, Crease.

647
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:54,158
Carl, what else you got?

648
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,610
National power grid?

649
00:44:57,778 --> 00:44:59,621
Okay.

650
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,253
Here we come.

651
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:08,380
Okay, Mother.

652
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:09,708
Probing.

653
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:16,347
Wow. Unbelievable.

654
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:21,344
Anybody want to black out New England?

655
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,804
Carl, what else?

656
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:26,516
Air traffic control system.

657
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:36,943
Okay, Mother.

658
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:43,999
Oh, my God.

659
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:47,253
How is this possible?

660
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:50,753
Cryptography systems are based on
mathematical problems so complex

661
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:53,254
they cannot be solved
without a key.

662
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:56,964
Janek figured out a way to solve
those problems without the key,

663
00:45:57,046 --> 00:45:59,595
and he hard-wired it
into that chip.

664
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:00,926
Turn it off.

665
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,931
Want to crash a couple
of passenger jets?

666
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,808
I said turn it off.

667
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:06,685
Turn it Off.

668
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:19,236
So it's a code-breaker.

669
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:23,703
No, it's the code-breaker.

670
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:28,874
No more secrets.

671
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:33,379
Honey, you and Melissa
get your things.

672
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:40,180
Night-night.

673
00:46:40,256 --> 00:46:41,382
Good night.

674
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:48,518
What time is the hand-off?

675
00:46:49,724 --> 00:46:51,192
9:00 a.m.

676
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:53,898
Well, between now and then,

677
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:57,448
we are going to institute
some security around here.

678
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:05,411
This is where I get off. Nice to
see you again. I'm out of here.

679
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:12,126
Don't take this personally, Liz, but you
were the only one who knew Martin's secret.

680
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,798
Somebody talked.

681
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:19,338
So make yourself comfortable. We're
all staying right here tonight.

682
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:25,014
No. I'm getting my bag,
and I'm leaving.

683
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:27,352
So relax, Crease.

684
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:32,851
I'll relax when we get
that damn thing out of here.

685
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:34,776
Until then, you stay.

686
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:40,316
What?

687
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:43,282
There isn't a government
on this planet

688
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:46,114
that wouldn't kill us all
for that thing.

689
00:47:56,332 --> 00:47:57,504
Sorry.

690
00:47:58,334 --> 00:47:59,631
I see.

691
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:02,130
Carl? Hit the alarm.

692
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:03,556
Mother, lock everything down.

693
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:05,591
Then kill the lights.
Whistler, unplug that thing.

694
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:06,680
You bet.

695
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:08,932
Thank you for the trust,
fellows.

696
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:53,769
I really enjoyed sleeping
with all you guys. Take care.

697
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:56,021
- Bye, Liz.
- You too, Liz.

698
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:09,702
I hope the hand-off goes well.

699
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:16,538
I'd hate for you to have
something new to run from.

700
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:24,337
Martin? Time.

701
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:30,593
Yeah.

702
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:10,807
Morning.
Hi.

703
00:50:10,883 --> 00:50:12,385
Any problems?

704
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:13,810
Nope.

705
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:15,559
Want a cappuccino?

706
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:16,768
No.

707
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:41,126
Got his check?

708
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:48,299
Hey, Martin!

709
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:50,723
Telephone!

710
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:52,391
Just a minute.

711
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,144
It's your mother.

712
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:13,326
She's... She's old. Excuse me.

713
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:27,380
Get in the car.

714
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:28,928
What?

715
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:30,926
Get in the car.

716
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:34,850
I didn't get the money.

717
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:36,051
Now!

718
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:42,816
What are you doing?
I didn't get the money.

719
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,564
Janek's dead.

720
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:48,109
They killed him.

721
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:51,567
The NSA doesn't kill people,
Martin. Who are they?

722
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,448
You said there isn't a
government on earth

723
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:54,870
that wouldn't kill
for that thing.

724
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:57,619
Not ours.
Who were those guys?

725
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:00,288
There's one way to find out.

726
00:52:21,013 --> 00:52:27,737
They took away my home. Help me out?
The government took away my home.

727
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:32,233
My God.

728
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:40,454
Don't tell me you can't do it
because I know you can.

729
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:43,206
And don't tell me you won't do
it, because I've got to have it.

730
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:46,038
Damn it! I need to know,
and I need to know now.

731
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:48,840
Hey, guys,
that federal building?

732
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:50,259
Scheduled for demolition
since August.

733
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:53,095
It housed the Federal Trade Commission,
the Department of Agriculture.

734
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:54,254
Been vacant for a month.

735
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:56,386
The NSA never had an office
in San Francisco.

736
00:52:56,465 --> 00:52:59,264
Their West Coast operations
are right out of Los Angeles.

737
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:01,971
Oh, God.
Yeah, thanks.

738
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:04,648
Janek's grant is from the NSA.

739
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:06,396
Oh no.

740
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,563
How could you
be so goddamn stupid?

741
00:53:10,646 --> 00:53:13,866
Two guys show up, say they're
government, and you just buy it.

742
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:16,490
They probably were government...

743
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,330
Just not ours.

744
00:53:25,077 --> 00:53:28,957
Everybody pack up whatever you can.
This place isn't safe.

745
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:32,460
What do you think you're doing?

746
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,715
I'm going to a concert.

747
00:53:58,861 --> 00:54:00,534
Keep smiling.

748
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:03,995
Martin, have you lost your mind?

749
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:05,747
Excuse yourself.

750
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:10,877
Darling, would you
excuse me for a moment?

751
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:27,773
Give me back Janek's box, Greg.

752
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:29,850
Martin, I don't have it.

753
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:32,357
Now you must believe me.

754
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:33,779
No.

755
00:54:33,896 --> 00:54:36,740
You set me up, Greg.
No, I do not believe you.

756
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:39,443
We had nothing to do
with this Janek business.

757
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,654
Not for lack of trying,
mind you.

758
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:44,615
Your codes are entirely
different from ours.

759
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:46,450
We never had any luck
in breaking them,

760
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,877
so Lord knows,
I wanted that box,

761
00:54:49,912 --> 00:54:52,210
but we did not take it.

762
00:54:57,211 --> 00:54:59,305
Then who did?

763
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:05,136
What I will tell you now I cannot
tell you in this building.

764
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:06,971
Do you understand?

765
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:10,562
Come.

766
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:15,941
Martin.

767
00:55:18,357 --> 00:55:20,234
You must trust me.

768
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:29,584
Him?

769
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:31,169
No.

770
00:55:32,621 --> 00:55:33,998
Him.

771
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:35,253
No.

772
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:41,756
Him?

773
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:46,014
I'm afraid these books are not
as current as they used to be.

774
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:47,891
You still
keep tabs on all our agents.

775
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:50,268
These are just the ones
we thought we could turn.

776
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:54,272
You know, sexual problems,
financial troubles.

777
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:57,772
Then we had financial troubles.

778
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:01,696
That's him. The older guy.

779
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:05,529
A loathsome man
named Buddy DeVries,

780
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:08,491
A.K.A. Buddy Weber,
Buddy Wallace.

781
00:56:08,574 --> 00:56:11,373
Wallace. That's him.

782
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:16,715
We tried to recruit him in '83.
Drinking problem, married three times.

783
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:20,253
Left the NSA four years ago.

784
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:23,930
Oh, my-

785
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:26,099
What?

786
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:30,686
What?

787
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:36,860
You disappeared once before, my friend.
I suggest you do it again.

788
00:56:38,312 --> 00:56:41,191
Why? Who's he working for?

789
00:56:45,277 --> 00:56:48,201
Your FBI
is such a pain in the ass.

790
00:56:53,702 --> 00:56:55,579
Who's he working for?

791
00:56:56,330 --> 00:57:00,176
Martin, I can offer you asylum
inside this car.

792
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,503
Technically,
it's part of the consulate.

793
00:57:02,586 --> 00:57:03,838
Do you wish our protection?

794
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:06,344
What? Who is Wallace
working for?

795
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:14,435
Mr. Bishop? My name is
Special Agent Bestrop, FBI.

796
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:16,983
Please, step out of the vehicle.

797
00:57:17,768 --> 00:57:19,270
Do you wish our protection?

798
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:20,730
Mr. Bishop.

799
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:23,198
Get out of the vehicle now.

800
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:32,082
You won't know who to trust.

801
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:40,875
Mr. Bishop, step over here, please.
Hands on the wall, sir.

802
00:57:53,053 --> 00:57:54,555
Is this loaded?

803
00:57:55,097 --> 00:57:56,223
Yes.

804
00:58:21,248 --> 00:58:23,171
Too many secrets.

805
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:37,828
Oh, shit.

806
00:59:38,033 --> 00:59:39,956
What are you doing up?

807
01:00:33,255 --> 01:00:34,632
Pain?

808
01:00:38,218 --> 01:00:39,891
Yeah.

809
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:48,649
Try aspirin.

810
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:56,532
Cosmo.

811
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,373
I'm sorry if he hurt you.

812
01:01:04,828 --> 01:01:07,752
I'm afraid Wallace
doesn't like you very much.

813
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:12,844
You ought to have that guy
checked for rabies.

814
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:15,923
Rabies occurs
only in warm-blooded animals.

815
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:20,348
Anyway, I couldn't have you
talking to the Russians.

816
01:01:20,427 --> 01:01:24,523
Five years ago, yes, we could trust
them not to go running to the FBI,

817
01:01:24,598 --> 01:01:26,918
or if they did, we could trust
the FBI not to believe them.

818
01:01:26,975 --> 01:01:30,775
Today we can't trust anybody.

819
01:01:31,563 --> 01:01:35,739
What the hell's going on here?
Cosmo, what...

820
01:01:37,277 --> 01:01:38,995
What happened?

821
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:44,292
The world changed on us,
Marty, and without our help.

822
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:47,296
What happened?

823
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:59,012
There I was in prison, and one day I
help a couple of nice older gentlemen

824
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:01,388
make some free telephone calls.

825
01:02:01,468 --> 01:02:05,564
They turn out to be,
let us say, good family men.

826
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:09,814
Organized crime?

827
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:12,316
Don't kid yourself.

828
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:14,902
It's not that organized.

829
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:18,076
Anyway, they arranged for me
to get an early release

830
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:20,404
from my
unfortunate incarceration,

831
01:02:20,487 --> 01:02:23,491
and I began to perform
a variety of services.

832
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:28,378
For starters, I reorganized their
entire financial operation:

833
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:31,206
budgets, payroll,
money laundering, you name it.

834
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:34,543
The whole network is protected by
a very powerful encryption system

835
01:02:34,626 --> 01:02:36,628
so the government
cannot read it.

836
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:39,885
But if the feds
get Janek's box...

837
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:44,682
Disaster. Therefore,
we must have it.

838
01:02:46,263 --> 01:02:48,436
To protect the organization.

839
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:49,808
Yes.

840
01:02:52,686 --> 01:02:54,609
No, I don't buy it.

841
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:58,032
I know you.

842
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:02,537
God, it's good to see you.

843
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:18,929
We were going to
change the world, Marty, remember?

844
01:03:19,004 --> 01:03:23,100
Did you ever get around to actually
doing it? No, I guess not.

845
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:25,347
Well, I think I can.

846
01:03:25,844 --> 01:03:26,891
Really.

847
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:28,062
Yes.

848
01:03:32,684 --> 01:03:37,315
What's wrong with this country, Marty?
Money. You taught me that.

849
01:03:38,148 --> 01:03:41,573
Evil defense contractors
had it, noble causes did not.

850
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:46,157
Politicians are bought and sold like so
much chattel. Our problems multiply.

851
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:49,869
Pollution, crime, drugs, poverty,
disease, hunger, despair.

852
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:53,046
We throw gobs of money at them.

853
01:03:53,121 --> 01:03:56,500
The problems always get worse.
Why is that?

854
01:03:56,583 --> 01:04:00,178
Because money's most powerful
ability is to allow bad people

855
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:03,177
to continue doing bad things at the
expense of those who don't have it.

856
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:05,679
I agree. Who did you say
you were working for?

857
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:07,887
That's just my day job.

858
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:11,599
Listen, when I was in prison, I learned
that everything in this world,

859
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:14,355
including money,
operates not on reality...

860
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:16,732
But the perception of reality.

861
01:04:19,647 --> 01:04:23,618
Posit, people think a bank
might be financially shaky.

862
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:25,866
Consequence, people start
to withdraw their money.

863
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:27,913
Result, pretty soon,
it is financially shaky.

864
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:30,037
Conclusion,
you can make banks fail.

865
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:34,296
I've already done that.
Maybe you've read about a few?

866
01:04:35,622 --> 01:04:37,169
Think bigger.

867
01:04:37,248 --> 01:04:38,420
Stock market?
Yes.

868
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:41,052
Currency market?
Commodities market? Yes.

869
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:43,175
Small countries?

870
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:49,390
I might even be able to crash
the whole damn system.

871
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:54,558
Destroy all records of ownership.
Think of it, Marty.

872
01:04:54,641 --> 01:04:58,236
No more rich people. No more poor people.
Everybody's the same.

873
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:00,814
Isn't that what we said
we always wanted?

874
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:04,860
Cos, you haven't gone crazy
on me, have you?

875
01:05:04,943 --> 01:05:08,322
Who else is going to change
the world, Marty?

876
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:10,328
Greenpeace?

877
01:05:16,788 --> 01:05:18,756
You are crazy.

878
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:26,973
Tomorrow they will retrieve
your fingerprints

879
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:29,722
from the gun that killed a
Russian consular officer.

880
01:05:29,801 --> 01:05:33,726
The following day, those prints will
be run through an FBI computer,

881
01:05:33,805 --> 01:05:35,899
and they will come up
with a name.

882
01:05:41,062 --> 01:05:44,612
Martin Brice,
my old and good friend,

883
01:05:44,691 --> 01:05:48,286
who promised me we would not get in
trouble and who, I might add, did not.

884
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:51,410
Then they will check this
database in Washington, D.C.,

885
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:54,413
which I'm now able to access,
thanks to you.

886
01:05:54,492 --> 01:05:59,464
Of course, no one knows where
Martin Brice is, do they?

887
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:03,885
But what if this indicated...

888
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:08,673
An alias?

889
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,177
Don't.

890
01:06:13,178 --> 01:06:14,930
Don't do it, Cos.

891
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:17,769
Pain?

892
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:22,524
Try prison.

893
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:28,909
<i>Ciao.</i>

894
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:32,997
Oh no, not the head.

895
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:34,449
Just relax.

896
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:37,706
No more secrets, Marty.

897
01:07:30,755 --> 01:07:32,382
I've had a bad night.

898
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:33,637
Really.

899
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:35,389
You look terrific.

900
01:07:35,677 --> 01:07:37,179
You look awful.

901
01:07:37,262 --> 01:07:39,811
I should think so, considering
what I've been through.

902
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:40,890
What happened?

903
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:42,442
You tell me.

904
01:07:42,684 --> 01:07:46,985
You got hit over the head twice and
got thrown out of a speeding car?

905
01:07:48,439 --> 01:07:50,737
Here, let me do this.

906
01:07:54,571 --> 01:07:55,993
I'm sorry.

907
01:07:57,448 --> 01:07:59,542
It's okay. I...

908
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:03,875
I'm sorry.

909
01:08:14,007 --> 01:08:16,681
The paper said that Greg
was killed.

910
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:21,222
I called your number,
and someone else answered.

911
01:08:21,306 --> 01:08:23,809
I didn't recognize the voice.

912
01:08:36,029 --> 01:08:38,327
I can't do this alone, Liz.

913
01:08:39,616 --> 01:08:41,118
I'm here.

914
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:02,896
We have to meet.

915
01:09:03,348 --> 01:09:06,318
<i>The FBI says the fingerprints
found in the embassy car</i>

916
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:09,396
<i>matched those taken from the
office of a government researcher</i>

917
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:12,653
<i>found murdered earlier
this week in Palo Alto.</i>

918
01:09:12,732 --> 01:09:16,782
<i>The connection was made after a Bay Area
radio station received an anonymous tip,</i>

919
01:09:16,861 --> 01:09:20,115
<i>linking the two killings.
More bad news...</i>

920
01:09:20,198 --> 01:09:21,916
The son of a bitch.

921
01:09:22,367 --> 01:09:25,246
All right. It's time we
call the authorities.

922
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:29,132
Great. Now that we're accessories
to espionage and murder.

923
01:09:29,207 --> 01:09:33,178
All the more reason to turn ourselves
in now while we can still cut a deal.

924
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:37,348
With what? We got bupkus! They'll give
us 20 years in the electric chair.

925
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:41,849
You think I like it? I've got a family!
We have no other choice.

926
01:09:41,928 --> 01:09:47,901
Yes, we do. We make the call,
but we make it our way.

927
01:09:48,726 --> 01:09:49,898
Unload the van.

928
01:09:49,977 --> 01:09:53,982
We got these band wideners here, Whis.
Where do you want them?

929
01:09:57,151 --> 01:09:59,495
Thanks. Nice apartment.

930
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:06,257
I'm going to bounce this call through
nine different relay stations

931
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:08,879
throughout the world
and off two satellites.

932
01:10:08,955 --> 01:10:11,879
It'll be the hardest trace
they've ever heard.

933
01:10:12,083 --> 01:10:14,927
This'll measure stress
in the voice on the other end.

934
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:18,552
Not as accurate
as a polygraph, but it'll do.

935
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:20,884
Unbelievable.

936
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:22,389
Let's do it.

937
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:35,615
<i>Fort Meade, Maryland. Good afternoon.</i>

938
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:38,197
Try director of ops.

939
01:10:38,484 --> 01:10:41,738
National Security Agency,
director of operations, please.

940
01:10:41,821 --> 01:10:43,494
<i>Extension, please?</i>

941
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:45,701
I'm sorry.
I forget the number.

942
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:48,753
Could I please have director of operations?
It's very important.

943
01:10:48,828 --> 01:10:50,922
<i>What extension, please?</i>

944
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:53,166
Try research.

945
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:56,381
Give me research.
It's an emergency.

946
01:10:56,461 --> 01:10:58,759
<i>I need an extension or a name.</i>

947
01:11:01,424 --> 01:11:03,552
Setec Astronomy.

948
01:11:05,344 --> 01:11:07,722
<i>One moment, please.</i>

949
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:11,851
They've started the trace.

950
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:13,811
<i>Who is this, please?</i>

951
01:11:13,895 --> 01:11:16,273
It's my dime. I'll ask the questions.
Who are you?

952
01:11:16,355 --> 01:11:19,359
<i>Well, let's say my name
is Mr. Abbott.</i>

953
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:21,110
True.

954
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:23,571
They made the second leg.

955
01:11:23,654 --> 01:11:27,909
Mr. Abbott, are you interested
in Setec Astronomy?

956
01:11:27,992 --> 01:11:31,166
<i>I'm interested
in all kinds of astronomy.</i>

957
01:11:34,582 --> 01:11:37,051
Cute. They've got the
satellite in Tokyo.

958
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:39,462
These guys are good.

959
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:45,310
I need to know if you're
someone who can make a deal.

960
01:11:45,384 --> 01:11:46,601
Go on.

961
01:11:46,761 --> 01:11:48,138
Can you deal?

962
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:49,268
<i>Yes.</i>

963
01:11:49,639 --> 01:11:50,686
True.

964
01:11:50,765 --> 01:11:53,564
They're across Transcom. You've
got about 20 seconds, Bish.

965
01:11:53,643 --> 01:11:56,738
If I come in,
can you guarantee my safety?

966
01:11:57,063 --> 01:11:59,782
<i>Do you have the item?</i>

967
01:12:01,108 --> 01:12:02,280
No.

968
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:03,828
Fifteen seconds.

969
01:12:03,903 --> 01:12:05,530
Can you guarantee my safety?

970
01:12:05,613 --> 01:12:07,035
<i>Where is the item?</i>

971
01:12:07,114 --> 01:12:08,536
Can you guarantee my safety?

972
01:12:08,616 --> 01:12:09,708
Five seconds.

973
01:12:09,784 --> 01:12:12,003
<i>Yes, I can guarantee
your safety.</i>

974
01:12:12,078 --> 01:12:13,375
Bish, he's lying.

975
01:12:13,454 --> 01:12:14,956
Hang up.
They've almost got us.

976
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:16,211
He's lying!

977
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:19,427
- Hang up, Bish! Hang up!
- He's lying! He's lying!

978
01:12:29,971 --> 01:12:32,315
There's gotta be a way to cut a deal.

979
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:33,733
Too late.

980
01:12:33,933 --> 01:12:37,028
If we had the box, yes.
Without it, no.

981
01:12:37,103 --> 01:12:39,526
So let's get this frigging thing.

982
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:41,005
I don't know where it is, remember?

983
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:42,900
What did it sound like?

984
01:12:42,984 --> 01:12:44,702
No idea where they took you?

985
01:12:44,777 --> 01:12:46,029
No.

986
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:48,340
They threw me in a trunk,
drove around in circles.

987
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:52,835
It could be a hundred miles away, next door,
underground, in a sky-rise. Forget it.

988
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:54,332
Bish, what did it sound like?

989
01:12:54,412 --> 01:12:55,538
What?

990
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:59,751
The road. When you were in the
trunk, what did the road sound like?

991
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:03,839
Well, I... Highway.
A regular highway.

992
01:13:03,921 --> 01:13:09,724
Well, did you go over any speed bumps?
Gravel? How about a bridge?

993
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:13,564
Bridge, yeah.

994
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:15,937
Four bridges in the Bay Area.

995
01:13:16,017 --> 01:13:18,691
Was the Golden Gate fogged in last night?

996
01:13:18,769 --> 01:13:19,895
Yes.

997
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:22,323
Did you hear a foghorn?

998
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:24,158
No.

999
01:13:25,985 --> 01:13:28,534
Scratch the Golden Gate.
That leaves three.

1000
01:13:28,613 --> 01:13:32,083
What did it sound like?
Did you go through a tunnel?

1001
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:34,456
I'm not... No.

1002
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:36,837
Scratch the Bay.

1003
01:13:36,996 --> 01:13:39,169
That leaves two.
San Mateo and Dumbarton.

1004
01:13:41,709 --> 01:13:44,428
What did it sound like?

1005
01:13:47,173 --> 01:13:48,766
Lower.

1006
01:13:51,886 --> 01:13:53,183
Lower.

1007
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:01,279
There was a recurring sound.

1008
01:14:01,854 --> 01:14:04,027
Like seams in the concrete.

1009
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:15,538
But further apart.

1010
01:14:19,372 --> 01:14:20,715
Yeah.

1011
01:14:38,099 --> 01:14:40,318
Now what?

1012
01:14:40,393 --> 01:14:42,612
Bumps. Rough ones.

1013
01:14:43,104 --> 01:14:45,357
Railroad tracks.
Yeah, yeah.

1014
01:14:45,439 --> 01:14:48,909
A right on Antrim
and a left on 84.

1015
01:14:49,568 --> 01:14:52,037
And then what did you hear?

1016
01:14:53,698 --> 01:14:54,950
Cocktail party.

1017
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:56,204
What?

1018
01:14:59,662 --> 01:15:05,965
Drove through what sounded... It
sounded like a cocktail party.

1019
01:15:07,211 --> 01:15:09,054
There was chattering.
It was right at the end.

1020
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:11,679
Great. Now we got to look
for a cocktail party

1021
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:13,555
on the other side
of the rail road track.

1022
01:15:13,634 --> 01:15:16,934
What's the exit
where the rail road tracks are?

1023
01:15:17,054 --> 01:15:18,146
Crescent.

1024
01:15:18,222 --> 01:15:20,896
Mother, stay on Crescent,
get off at the reservoir.

1025
01:15:20,975 --> 01:15:22,397
Okay-

1026
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:26,401
There's a cocktail party
at the reservoir?

1027
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:29,776
Yeah. Yeah.

1028
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:38,326
Very good, Bish. Remind me to make
you an honorary blind person.

1029
01:15:39,618 --> 01:15:40,961
Great.

1030
01:15:43,247 --> 01:15:45,466
Where's this road go?

1031
01:15:46,917 --> 01:15:50,797
Nowhere. Looks like it
ends right around that hill.

1032
01:15:51,338 --> 01:15:52,760
What's behind the hill?

1033
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:55,138
Nothing.
It's private property.

1034
01:15:58,888 --> 01:16:00,390
Private.

1035
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:32,054
Forget it. It's a toy company.

1036
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:36,179
A toy company, my ass.
That's laser fencing.

1037
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:38,302
There's high voltage
on the perimeter.

1038
01:16:38,385 --> 01:16:40,934
The whole building says,
"Go away."

1039
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:44,734
It's Cosmo. I know it.
The toy company's a front.

1040
01:16:45,351 --> 01:16:49,276
Mother, get the directional.
Carl, get the video. Let's go.

1041
01:16:54,693 --> 01:16:56,866
Second floor, northwest two.

1042
01:16:57,571 --> 01:16:59,289
That's a bathroom.

1043
01:17:00,533 --> 01:17:02,911
Second floor, northwest three.

1044
01:17:04,203 --> 01:17:06,297
Ah, it's an emergency exit.

1045
01:17:06,372 --> 01:17:07,919
How do you know that?

1046
01:17:07,998 --> 01:17:11,923
I can hear the emergency
floodlight batteries recharging.

1047
01:17:14,421 --> 01:17:17,300
Hold it right there.
Crease, what's this mean?

1048
01:17:17,383 --> 01:17:20,182
"My voice is my passport.
Verify me"?

1049
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:23,727
Some sort of voiceprint I.D.
I'll check it out.

1050
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:30,320
What am I listening to now,
Mother?

1051
01:17:30,396 --> 01:17:33,149
Third floor, southwest corner.

1052
01:17:33,274 --> 01:17:36,118
Oh, it's bursting
with ultrasonic.

1053
01:17:36,193 --> 01:17:39,037
I've never heard sensors
that powerful before.

1054
01:17:39,446 --> 01:17:43,792
Bish, someone is very serious about
keeping people out of that room.

1055
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:45,543
Yeah.

1056
01:17:50,291 --> 01:17:51,759
Okay.

1057
01:17:56,922 --> 01:18:00,472
Okay, there's the corner room with
the motion detectors Whistler heard.

1058
01:18:00,551 --> 01:18:03,225
That's Cosmo's office.
I saw the sensors.

1059
01:18:03,304 --> 01:18:04,931
They keep the lights
on all night,

1060
01:18:05,014 --> 01:18:08,018
so we have to assume
the sensors are on too.

1061
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:09,568
It won't be easy
getting in there.

1062
01:18:09,643 --> 01:18:13,364
Run this on ahead. Let's figure
out who works next door.

1063
01:18:16,275 --> 01:18:19,905
It's fascinating what 50 bucks can get
you at the county recorder's office.

1064
01:18:19,987 --> 01:18:21,614
What do you got?

1065
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:23,582
PlayTronics'
corporate headquarters.

1066
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:25,375
The complete blueprints.

1067
01:18:25,451 --> 01:18:27,670
Not bad. Not bad, Carl.

1068
01:18:27,745 --> 01:18:29,247
Oh, thanks.

1069
01:18:30,456 --> 01:18:31,799
Where'd you get the 50 bucks?

1070
01:18:31,874 --> 01:18:33,876
I took it from Mother's wallet.

1071
01:18:33,959 --> 01:18:35,256
Good.

1072
01:18:35,628 --> 01:18:39,474
No, Mom, today's not a good
day to come over. No...

1073
01:18:40,299 --> 01:18:42,222
Okay, what have we got here?

1074
01:18:42,301 --> 01:18:46,147
It's called a mantrap. I borrowed
this demo from the manufacturer.

1075
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:50,193
It's a digital voice-recognition
monitor hooked up to an access booth.

1076
01:18:50,267 --> 01:18:51,985
NSA uses the same technology

1077
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:55,565
to keep people out of
restricted areas at Fort Meade.

1078
01:18:55,648 --> 01:18:56,900
Card?

1079
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:03,323
Now speak right into this box.

1080
01:19:04,323 --> 01:19:05,370
Hi.

1081
01:19:05,449 --> 01:19:07,918
My name is Martin Bishop.

1082
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:11,042
My voice is my passport.
Verify me.

1083
01:19:13,499 --> 01:19:14,899
And you can't pass through

1084
01:19:14,917 --> 01:19:17,670
unless your voiceprint matches
the one encoded on the card.

1085
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:21,098
So we need someone's card.
And their voice.

1086
01:19:21,173 --> 01:19:22,595
Can we beat this with tape?

1087
01:19:22,675 --> 01:19:24,552
Has to be up close and personal.

1088
01:19:24,635 --> 01:19:27,605
Otherwise you'll be caught
in a steel-reinforced booth

1089
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:30,103
while the guards
with the shotguns are called.

1090
01:19:30,182 --> 01:19:31,399
Ah, that's great.

1091
01:19:31,475 --> 01:19:33,227
Really great.
What about motion detectors?

1092
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:37,531
I'm picking one up this afternoon.
That makes beating this look easy.

1093
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:41,865
Hey, Bish, I think
we've found our guy.

1094
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:47,166
Okay, I've blown up the image a little.
Here's the room next to Cosmo's.

1095
01:19:47,241 --> 01:19:50,791
Now it's the end of the day.
Watch who comes out.

1096
01:19:50,869 --> 01:19:53,372
Let me zoom in
on the front door.

1097
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:58,586
A lady in a green skirt
and this guy with the cap.

1098
01:19:59,545 --> 01:20:03,300
Nobody comes out for another 18 minutes.
So it's one of those two.

1099
01:20:03,382 --> 01:20:06,977
Right. Here's the next evening.
Again...

1100
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:11,273
The office next to Cosmo's.
Lights go out.

1101
01:20:14,476 --> 01:20:15,568
The guy in the cap.

1102
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:16,861
Anybody else?

1103
01:20:16,937 --> 01:20:20,942
Nobody else comes out for 22 minutes.
That's who works next door.

1104
01:20:21,025 --> 01:20:24,950
We'll use his office to get into Cosmo's.
Can we get plates?

1105
01:20:25,029 --> 01:20:26,576
Let me see.

1106
01:20:28,991 --> 01:20:30,664
Zooming in.

1107
01:20:32,119 --> 01:20:34,872
Another bump. Enhancing.

1108
01:20:37,082 --> 01:20:40,211
There's your plate. 180 IQ.

1109
01:20:42,421 --> 01:20:47,052
Cute. All right. Carl,
let's do this guy.

1110
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:50,012
His name's Werner Brandes.

1111
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:53,474
Single, 6'1", 174 pounds,
must wear glasses to drive,

1112
01:20:53,557 --> 01:20:55,355
no outstanding
tickets or warrants.

1113
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:59,439
He leaves work between
6:00 and 7:00 every night,

1114
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:02,024
takes the same route home,
he obeys the speed limit,

1115
01:21:02,107 --> 01:21:06,328
comes to a complete stop at every stop
sign and signals when he changes lanes.

1116
01:21:06,445 --> 01:21:07,697
He's a very safe driver.

1117
01:21:09,239 --> 01:21:15,667
$750 limit on his Visa, pays his
bills, no bad debts, no bum checks.

1118
01:21:16,121 --> 01:21:17,623
No registered firearms.

1119
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:20,960
Member, International Microchip
Designers Association

1120
01:21:21,043 --> 01:21:23,262
and chairman
of the social committee.

1121
01:21:23,337 --> 01:21:26,466
Great. The world's most
boring human.

1122
01:21:26,548 --> 01:21:29,017
How the hell are we going to get
close enough to record him?

1123
01:21:32,388 --> 01:21:34,356
Oh, Mother.

1124
01:21:35,974 --> 01:21:39,604
Sorry, Liz. Standard procedure.
Trash from the guy's house.

1125
01:21:41,063 --> 01:21:43,907
And thank you
for bringing it into mine.

1126
01:21:47,986 --> 01:21:53,618
Okay, let's see here. Phone bill,
no long distance. Club Med brochure.

1127
01:21:55,619 --> 01:21:58,668
A ticket stub
to a Barry Manilow concert.

1128
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:03,419
Here it is. Here we go.

1129
01:22:03,502 --> 01:22:08,053
"Dear Compudater. Welcome to the
world of automated compatibility."

1130
01:22:09,216 --> 01:22:10,809
He's a computer dater.

1131
01:22:10,884 --> 01:22:12,932
I love it.
Let's get him a date.

1132
01:22:13,011 --> 01:22:16,811
What was the name of that girl that we used
on the cereal company sneak last year?

1133
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:19,894
Sandy Krieger?
Forget it. Married a cop.

1134
01:22:20,018 --> 01:22:24,068
How about Barbara?
Now, she was cute.

1135
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:27,363
Yeah, but she'd never do it. She
regards this work as juvenile.

1136
01:22:27,443 --> 01:22:30,868
That's why she divorced me.
How about your friend Jessie?

1137
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:33,916
Yeah, she's buff.
Fellows...

1138
01:22:34,158 --> 01:22:39,460
Fellows, look at this man's trash.
He's not looking for buff.

1139
01:22:39,538 --> 01:22:42,132
It's the nicest garbage
I've ever seen.

1140
01:22:42,207 --> 01:22:44,175
The man who folded
this tube of Crest

1141
01:22:44,251 --> 01:22:47,505
is looking for someone
meticulous, refined...

1142
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:49,552
Anal.

1143
01:22:55,137 --> 01:22:56,559
What?

1144
01:23:17,618 --> 01:23:21,373
Werner? Hi. I'm Doris.

1145
01:23:22,581 --> 01:23:23,753
Hi.

1146
01:23:25,334 --> 01:23:27,177
Are you ready
for the dim sum bar?

1147
01:23:27,252 --> 01:23:29,596
Oh, I'm not really in any hurry.

1148
01:23:30,047 --> 01:23:32,425
All right.
I'll be right back.

1149
01:23:58,116 --> 01:24:00,244
So.
So.

1150
01:24:01,286 --> 01:24:06,463
What an interesting name you have.
How exactly do you pronounce it?

1151
01:24:16,802 --> 01:24:19,305
This is what's in Cosmo's office.

1152
01:24:23,559 --> 01:24:26,153
The best motion sensor
on the market.

1153
01:24:26,228 --> 01:24:28,071
Watch this.

1154
01:24:30,482 --> 01:24:33,656
It also responds
to thermal differentials.

1155
01:24:33,944 --> 01:24:35,287
Does this have a happy ending?

1156
01:24:35,362 --> 01:24:36,534
Oh, yeah.

1157
01:24:36,613 --> 01:24:39,992
We can wrap you in a full body suit
of neoprene, heat-resistant rubber,

1158
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:41,076
or we can raise the temperature

1159
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:43,161
in Cosmo's office
to 98.6 degrees,

1160
01:24:43,245 --> 01:24:44,872
which is probably
what we'll have to do

1161
01:24:44,955 --> 01:24:46,878
because the neoprene
would suffocate you.

1162
01:24:46,957 --> 01:24:52,555
Either way, you've got a top
speed of two inches per second.

1163
01:24:53,046 --> 01:24:55,674
Any faster than that...

1164
01:24:55,799 --> 01:24:59,645
And big guys with guns.
You'll probably do fine.

1165
01:25:00,887 --> 01:25:02,059
Since when am I the one...

1166
01:25:02,139 --> 01:25:05,018
This is the same answering machine
Janek used for the shell of his box.

1167
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:08,695
That's what you'll be carrying across
the floor at two inches per second.

1168
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:12,946
I got that for you because I figured
you'd just want to practice with it.

1169
01:25:13,025 --> 01:25:15,027
Remember to go real slow!

1170
01:25:15,902 --> 01:25:17,028
Slow.

1171
01:25:20,073 --> 01:25:22,747
You get all the fun stuff.

1172
01:25:41,094 --> 01:25:46,567
So, what about travel? Where do
you like to go? Europe? Mexico?

1173
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:49,611
I don't know. I've never
been out of the country.

1174
01:25:49,686 --> 01:25:51,654
I think they want us to leave.

1175
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:53,448
Sit down, Werner.

1176
01:25:55,901 --> 01:25:58,074
Talk to me. You know what?

1177
01:25:59,279 --> 01:26:02,408
I really love the sound
of your voice.

1178
01:26:02,741 --> 01:26:07,121
Really? I always thought it was
kind of nasal and pinched.

1179
01:26:07,204 --> 01:26:10,253
Oh no, not at all.
It's lovely.

1180
01:26:10,332 --> 01:26:17,307
And there's this one word. I've
always loved the sound of this word.

1181
01:26:18,548 --> 01:26:20,471
Oh no!
No, what? What?

1182
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:23,554
You wouldn't. Never mind.
I would. What, please?

1183
01:26:24,096 --> 01:26:26,019
Oh, all right.

1184
01:26:26,223 --> 01:26:31,229
I would really like to
hear you say the word...

1185
01:26:32,354 --> 01:26:34,448
"Passport."

1186
01:26:37,943 --> 01:26:39,320
Passport?

1187
01:26:42,531 --> 01:26:43,874
Passport.

1188
01:26:43,949 --> 01:26:46,873
You know, you're right.
We ought to leave.

1189
01:26:46,952 --> 01:26:48,169
Doris?

1190
01:26:50,163 --> 01:26:52,916
Would you like
to have breakfast with me?

1191
01:26:53,291 --> 01:26:54,713
Sure, fine.

1192
01:26:55,877 --> 01:26:58,471
Shall I phone you or nudge you?

1193
01:27:01,133 --> 01:27:02,350
Check, please.

1194
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:16,740
<i>Hi. My name is Werner Brandes.</i>

1195
01:27:16,815 --> 01:27:20,445
<i>My voice is my passport.
Verify me. Thank you.</i>

1196
01:27:42,466 --> 01:27:45,845
Is that the gardener?
I thought he'd already left.

1197
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:47,729
I guess not.

1198
01:27:58,064 --> 01:28:00,408
May I use your john, please?

1199
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:13,690
Listen, a few minutes ago,
a gardener came...

1200
01:29:16,601 --> 01:29:18,444
Skip it. I see him.

1201
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:28,955
Okay, fellows, I'm out of here.
Carl, have a nice ride.

1202
01:30:08,528 --> 01:30:10,075
Oh, it's hot in here.

1203
01:30:10,155 --> 01:30:11,407
Uh-huh.

1204
01:30:12,157 --> 01:30:15,627
Maybe I'll just
open this window a bit.

1205
01:30:15,702 --> 01:30:19,002
I'll join you as soon as I'm
through pounding these breasts.

1206
01:30:21,291 --> 01:30:24,340
Do you know, the best
thing about this meal,

1207
01:30:24,419 --> 01:30:29,550
besides it's absolutely fabulous,
is that it only has 400 calories.

1208
01:30:29,633 --> 01:30:30,976
Oh, great.

1209
01:30:31,051 --> 01:30:32,928
I'm very concerned
about what we eat.

1210
01:30:33,011 --> 01:30:34,012
You are.

1211
01:30:34,095 --> 01:30:36,598
What would you say
is the ideal diet?

1212
01:30:36,681 --> 01:30:41,357
Well, sort of, eat, sort of on the run.
I'm really busy, so...

1213
01:30:41,436 --> 01:30:46,567
The ideal diet, don't laugh, is
the bottom of a monkey cage.

1214
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:48,152
I'm sorry?

1215
01:30:48,234 --> 01:30:50,828
Take a look at the bottom
of a monkey cage.

1216
01:30:51,446 --> 01:30:53,414
Is someone at your door?

1217
01:30:54,449 --> 01:30:56,827
Just a second.
I'm not expecting anyone.

1218
01:30:59,788 --> 01:31:03,042
No. Nobody there.

1219
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:06,052
Oh, I'm sorry.
We're all alone.

1220
01:31:06,878 --> 01:31:10,473
I'll just close the window.
It's okay now.

1221
01:31:11,091 --> 01:31:12,843
It's true. I read that once.

1222
01:31:12,926 --> 01:31:14,527
I don't know. What are
you talking about?

1223
01:31:14,594 --> 01:31:17,814
You have fruit, greens...

1224
01:31:22,185 --> 01:31:25,109
<i>Good evening. PlayTronics.</i>

1225
01:31:50,922 --> 01:31:52,265
Cattle mutilations are up.

1226
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:53,842
Don't.

1227
01:31:53,925 --> 01:31:55,347
Sorry.

1228
01:32:22,996 --> 01:32:24,839
Hey, here we go.

1229
01:32:24,914 --> 01:32:26,291
We've got video,
all eight of them.

1230
01:32:26,374 --> 01:32:28,547
Whistler, hit record.

1231
01:32:28,626 --> 01:32:30,048
You're coming in fine.

1232
01:32:30,128 --> 01:32:32,972
You are clear all the way
up to the mantrap.

1233
01:32:58,114 --> 01:32:59,912
<i>Hi, my name</i> is...

1234
01:33:09,459 --> 01:33:13,009
<i>Hi, my name is Werner Brandes.</i>

1235
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:16,934
<i>My voice is my passport.
Verify me.</i>

1236
01:34:50,184 --> 01:34:51,745
There's a three-foot area
in the corner,

1237
01:34:51,769 --> 01:34:53,942
<i>just outside the sensor's range.</i>

1238
01:34:54,105 --> 01:34:56,528
Good. Hold on. Whistler?

1239
01:34:56,858 --> 01:34:59,031
Carl, how's the weather?

1240
01:34:59,110 --> 01:35:01,329
98.6 and holding.

1241
01:35:01,404 --> 01:35:04,704
Beauty.
We got body temp, Crease.

1242
01:35:05,825 --> 01:35:07,042
Go.

1243
01:35:28,473 --> 01:35:31,192
Once again, I am so
sorry about dinner.

1244
01:35:31,476 --> 01:35:34,070
No, it was really delicious.

1245
01:35:34,145 --> 01:35:37,319
No, no.
I overcooked the carrots.

1246
01:35:37,398 --> 01:35:40,698
No, I like them really squishy
like that.

1247
01:35:42,111 --> 01:35:43,658
That's cute.

1248
01:35:43,738 --> 01:35:46,787
Oh, oh, watch.
Watch this.

1249
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:53,673
Play dead.

1250
01:35:56,042 --> 01:35:57,885
Great!

1251
01:35:57,961 --> 01:36:00,384
I designed
the voice recognition chip.

1252
01:36:00,463 --> 01:36:04,764
What a thing to do! Could I
just make a quick phone call?

1253
01:36:04,842 --> 01:36:07,265
Sure. It's in
the bedroom.

1254
01:36:08,012 --> 01:36:09,184
Upstairs?

1255
01:36:09,264 --> 01:36:14,361
Yeah, just go upstairs and
then walk straight forward.

1256
01:36:15,061 --> 01:36:17,359
The first one is a closet.

1257
01:36:19,357 --> 01:36:24,284
Oh, pooch. Look what you've
done to Doris's purse.

1258
01:36:28,366 --> 01:36:29,413
Hmm.

1259
01:36:54,684 --> 01:36:55,685
Psst!

1260
01:36:55,977 --> 01:36:59,106
What do you say
we go for a ride, Doris?

1261
01:37:17,915 --> 01:37:19,792
CREASE: I don't believe this!

1262
01:37:20,084 --> 01:37:22,507
Now what are you saying?
The NSA killed Kennedy?

1263
01:37:22,587 --> 01:37:26,592
No, they shot him, but they didn't
kill him. He's still alive.

1264
01:37:27,050 --> 01:37:31,305
That's it. I've had it. I don't
want to talk to you anymore.

1265
01:37:31,471 --> 01:37:33,644
Just do your job. I don't
want to talk to you anymore.

1266
01:37:33,723 --> 01:37:35,225
Okay, fine.

1267
01:37:35,641 --> 01:37:38,269
It was the same people
who framed Pete Rose.

1268
01:37:40,521 --> 01:37:43,695
Boy, this was fun.
Wanna go back?

1269
01:37:43,775 --> 01:37:45,743
No, we're almost there.

1270
01:37:45,818 --> 01:37:47,286
Almost where?

1271
01:37:53,159 --> 01:37:54,331
Crease!
Forget it.

1272
01:37:54,452 --> 01:37:56,125
No, Crease.
Forget it.

1273
01:37:56,204 --> 01:37:58,548
Werner just pulled up.
He's got Liz with him.

1274
01:37:58,623 --> 01:38:00,125
No.

1275
01:38:01,959 --> 01:38:05,680
Martin?
I think you better hurry.

1276
01:38:09,550 --> 01:38:12,975
The one thing
I can't do is hurry.

1277
01:38:38,121 --> 01:38:40,499
<i>"Come on. I want you to say
it for me just one time."</i>

1278
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:43,425
<i>"Passport. You have such
a beautiful voice."</i>

1279
01:38:43,501 --> 01:38:46,755
<i>I'm Dr. Brandes. I work up on three.
I believe this phony</i>

1280
01:38:46,838 --> 01:38:49,512
<i>is involved in some plot
to break into my office.</i>

1281
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:53,265
<i>Hold it! Hold it! Let
me see your entry card.</i>

1282
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:57,644
<i>You took my card.
What card? See?</i>

1283
01:38:57,723 --> 01:39:00,351
Sir, we have a problem.

1284
01:39:30,590 --> 01:39:33,514
I think that someone is trying
to break into my office!

1285
01:39:33,593 --> 01:39:35,266
Let's take a look at his office.

1286
01:40:21,641 --> 01:40:23,109
Well?

1287
01:40:24,227 --> 01:40:27,356
Well, everything seems
to be in order.

1288
01:40:27,438 --> 01:40:28,985
Does it?
Yes, sir.

1289
01:40:33,194 --> 01:40:34,696
Very sorry to have
troubled you, miss.

1290
01:40:34,779 --> 01:40:37,749
Not as sorry as I am.
Werner?

1291
01:40:46,499 --> 01:40:48,501
They're letting her go.

1292
01:40:49,168 --> 01:40:50,761
We'll call you a cab.

1293
01:40:50,836 --> 01:40:54,261
Thank you.
This is my last computer date.

1294
01:40:56,717 --> 01:40:58,060
Wait.

1295
01:40:59,971 --> 01:41:04,272
A computer matched her
with him? I don't think so.

1296
01:41:08,646 --> 01:41:09,989
Marty.

1297
01:41:19,615 --> 01:41:22,164
Why is it so hot in here?

1298
01:41:31,836 --> 01:41:33,588
Marty!

1299
01:41:41,331 --> 01:41:43,532
Martin, we've got six
guards in the front lobby,

1300
01:41:43,556 --> 01:41:46,605
four in the south corridor,
five upstairs north.

1301
01:41:46,684 --> 01:41:47,776
Guards in the boiler room.

1302
01:41:47,852 --> 01:41:49,104
Oh, God.

1303
01:41:49,353 --> 01:41:52,698
Carl, listen carefully.
You've got trouble.

1304
01:41:53,065 --> 01:41:54,692
Heating ducts over the furnace.

1305
01:41:54,775 --> 01:41:57,619
You'll be all right. Find the
heating ducts above the furnace.

1306
01:41:57,695 --> 01:42:00,073
That'll lead you
to the elevator chase.

1307
01:42:00,531 --> 01:42:03,330
There's a fire escape at the
end of the north corridor.

1308
01:42:03,451 --> 01:42:05,579
You'll have to break through fire walls.
Have him go south.

1309
01:42:05,703 --> 01:42:10,004
No. Go directly north, 30 yards.
There's an air duct there!

1310
01:42:10,082 --> 01:42:12,084
Once you're there, let me know.

1311
01:42:12,209 --> 01:42:15,964
Blue team, move to corridor one.
Green team, secure north corridor.

1312
01:42:16,047 --> 01:42:19,517
He'll be in a crawl space.
Break through.

1313
01:42:33,856 --> 01:42:37,281
Crease? I'm in northeast
three, over the corridor.

1314
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:39,579
<i>I think it's</i> a <i>dead end.
Don't move.</i>

1315
01:42:41,405 --> 01:42:43,203
Don't worry.
We'll get you out of there.

1316
01:42:43,282 --> 01:42:46,957
We've got guards at every stairwell.
Can you hear if there's any...

1317
01:42:53,834 --> 01:42:55,086
Oh no.

1318
01:42:55,753 --> 01:42:58,552
What? Don't say "Oh no."

1319
01:43:03,094 --> 01:43:06,894
This is Wallace. I'm in northeast three.
I'm gonna check it out.

1320
01:43:09,642 --> 01:43:12,111
Martin, we lost...

1321
01:43:19,527 --> 01:43:21,120
Do you read me?

1322
01:43:32,623 --> 01:43:33,840
Damn!

1323
01:43:38,337 --> 01:43:40,055
<i>Stop shooting.</i>

1324
01:43:41,882 --> 01:43:43,225
Marty?

1325
01:43:44,719 --> 01:43:47,393
I know you are in the building

1326
01:43:47,471 --> 01:43:50,645
<i>and I know you can hear me.</i>

1327
01:43:50,975 --> 01:43:52,318
<i>God.</i>

1328
01:43:54,353 --> 01:43:57,152
<i>You should not
have come back, Marty.</i>

1329
01:43:58,149 --> 01:44:00,322
<i>I won and you lost.</i>

1330
01:44:01,318 --> 01:44:03,867
<i>If our friendship had meant
anything to you at all,</i>

1331
01:44:03,946 --> 01:44:05,323
<i>that is the way
you should have left it.</i>

1332
01:44:05,406 --> 01:44:09,252
<i>But you always had to be the
one to win, didn't you?</i>

1333
01:44:09,326 --> 01:44:12,921
<i>You were the one who got away
with things while I never did.</i>

1334
01:44:14,582 --> 01:44:19,053
<i>You always had to get
the girl, didn't you?</i>

1335
01:44:23,674 --> 01:44:25,642
Sol never did...

1336
01:44:29,054 --> 01:44:31,307
At least not until now.

1337
01:44:36,312 --> 01:44:38,781
She's lovely, Marty.

1338
01:44:42,902 --> 01:44:44,495
<i>Please.</i>

1339
01:44:45,446 --> 01:44:48,416
Marty, please bring me the box.

1340
01:44:50,117 --> 01:44:55,339
<i>You must know they will never let either
of you live if you try to get out.</i>

1341
01:44:56,874 --> 01:44:59,377
<i>I am your way out.</i>

1342
01:45:00,795 --> 01:45:02,843
I'm your only way out.

1343
01:45:05,341 --> 01:45:07,764
<i>If I wanted you dead...</i>

1344
01:45:08,969 --> 01:45:11,722
<i>You'd be dead.</i>

1345
01:45:12,223 --> 01:45:13,725
<i>Marty,</i>

1346
01:45:14,141 --> 01:45:15,893
I cannot kill you.

1347
01:45:18,270 --> 01:45:21,444
I cannot kill you.

1348
01:45:24,068 --> 01:45:26,742
You have to trust me.

1349
01:45:30,825 --> 01:45:35,456
Guys, I'm going in.
Do you hear me, Carl?

1350
01:45:38,499 --> 01:45:39,546
Yes.

1351
01:46:02,898 --> 01:46:03,945
Hi.
Hi.

1352
01:46:04,024 --> 01:46:07,028
How are you?
Fine. How are you?

1353
01:46:08,112 --> 01:46:09,409
Yeah.

1354
01:46:12,241 --> 01:46:14,539
So you have my box.

1355
01:46:19,498 --> 01:46:23,298
We have a deal. Right?

1356
01:46:29,049 --> 01:46:31,723
Wait a second. Wait a minute!

1357
01:46:33,929 --> 01:46:36,557
Goddamn it,
you gave me your word!

1358
01:46:45,858 --> 01:46:47,860
I cannot kill my friend.

1359
01:46:51,530 --> 01:46:53,203
Kill my friend.

1360
01:46:57,620 --> 01:46:59,543
You son of a bitch.

1361
01:46:59,663 --> 01:47:03,338
You didn't really think we were
gonna let you go, did you?

1362
01:47:04,335 --> 01:47:08,056
You didn't really think I was gonna
let you have this box, did you?

1363
01:47:08,130 --> 01:47:09,427
What?

1364
01:47:09,506 --> 01:47:10,758
Now.

1365
01:47:10,841 --> 01:47:13,469
Now?
What are you talking about?

1366
01:47:14,011 --> 01:47:15,103
Now!

1367
01:47:15,638 --> 01:47:17,561
You're damn right, now!

1368
01:47:18,849 --> 01:47:19,941
Carl, now!

1369
01:47:20,017 --> 01:47:22,270
Geronimo!

1370
01:47:28,359 --> 01:47:30,157
Let go of him.

1371
01:47:33,447 --> 01:47:38,123
I mean it. I'm an excellent marksman.
Woman! Move!

1372
01:47:38,786 --> 01:47:40,379
Oh, sure. Sure.

1373
01:47:44,458 --> 01:47:45,801
Get up.

1374
01:47:52,633 --> 01:47:54,351
You!

1375
01:47:55,094 --> 01:47:56,892
Carl, what the hell
were you waiting for?

1376
01:47:56,971 --> 01:47:58,564
That's not easy,
what I just did.

1377
01:47:58,681 --> 01:48:00,683
Guys, could we get out of here?
Yeah.

1378
01:48:02,893 --> 01:48:04,190
Here.

1379
01:48:08,482 --> 01:48:10,405
- Up, up, up!
- I'm up!

1380
01:48:10,484 --> 01:48:11,531
Hurry!

1381
01:48:19,743 --> 01:48:21,290
Crease, we're on the roof.

1382
01:48:21,370 --> 01:48:24,374
There's a fire escape on the north side.
Is it clear?

1383
01:48:25,541 --> 01:48:27,259
Yes, clear.

1384
01:48:29,962 --> 01:48:31,214
Where are you?

1385
01:48:31,296 --> 01:48:34,140
<i>On a hill overlooking the
northeast corner of the lot.</i>

1386
01:48:34,216 --> 01:48:35,217
There.

1387
01:48:36,051 --> 01:48:37,928
Beautiful. Come and get us.

1388
01:48:38,012 --> 01:48:42,267
Hurry up. We've only got a few minutes
before anybody knows we're gone.

1389
01:48:43,684 --> 01:48:45,607
Coming to get you.

1390
01:48:49,064 --> 01:48:53,114
Put your hands where I can see
them and step out of the van.

1391
01:48:53,819 --> 01:48:55,947
You too, midnight.

1392
01:49:18,385 --> 01:49:21,013
Bish, they've got
Crease and Mother.

1393
01:49:23,557 --> 01:49:24,934
Shit!

1394
01:49:27,853 --> 01:49:29,821
Whistler, you've got to do it.

1395
01:49:30,814 --> 01:49:31,815
Do what?

1396
01:49:32,149 --> 01:49:36,245
You gotta drive. I'll talk you through it.
Now, hurry.

1397
01:49:36,820 --> 01:49:38,367
Drive what?

1398
01:49:57,299 --> 01:49:58,425
Okay, Bish.

1399
01:49:58,509 --> 01:50:00,978
There's a gate
about 30 yards behind you.

1400
01:50:01,053 --> 01:50:03,397
<i>Put it in reverse and floor it.</i>

1401
01:50:05,015 --> 01:50:08,485
Did I ever tell you
why I had to leave the CIA?

1402
01:50:09,019 --> 01:50:10,441
No.

1403
01:50:15,234 --> 01:50:16,702
What's reverse?

1404
01:50:17,528 --> 01:50:18,996
One down.

1405
01:50:19,571 --> 01:50:21,198
My temper.

1406
01:50:26,745 --> 01:50:27,746
Wow!

1407
01:50:27,830 --> 01:50:30,674
Motherfuckers mess with me,
I'll split your head!

1408
01:50:31,083 --> 01:50:34,883
Crease, where's Whistler going?

1409
01:50:36,547 --> 01:50:39,391
Bish? I'm going backwards.

1410
01:50:39,466 --> 01:50:41,719
You're doing fine. Doing fine.

1411
01:50:45,055 --> 01:50:47,683
Now, hit the brakes! Now!

1412
01:50:50,310 --> 01:50:53,564
Okay, put the gearshift down
two notches.

1413
01:50:53,647 --> 01:50:55,490
Down two notches.

1414
01:50:57,734 --> 01:50:59,452
<i>Turn left. Floor it.</i>

1415
01:51:01,488 --> 01:51:02,990
I'm going forward.

1416
01:51:03,073 --> 01:51:04,916
Do... Straighten out.

1417
01:51:08,120 --> 01:51:09,212
Oh, what was that?

1418
01:51:09,288 --> 01:51:11,211
Okay, keep coming.

1419
01:51:11,957 --> 01:51:14,551
Oh, God, I'm driving!
I'm driving!

1420
01:51:17,588 --> 01:51:20,717
No, don't do that.
I'm driving!

1421
01:51:25,304 --> 01:51:26,681
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Go left!

1422
01:51:27,848 --> 01:51:29,816
My... My left. Right.

1423
01:51:29,892 --> 01:51:31,610
Go right! Right!

1424
01:51:36,481 --> 01:51:37,824
It's okay.

1425
01:51:40,777 --> 01:51:43,621
Beautiful! Keep coming.
Keep coming.

1426
01:51:43,697 --> 01:51:47,418
Now, you're gonna go down
a very gentle slope.

1427
01:51:47,743 --> 01:51:49,791
Okay, fine. Great. No problem.

1428
01:51:51,496 --> 01:51:52,588
Oh boy!

1429
01:51:57,252 --> 01:52:00,347
Doing okay.
Five more seconds and stop.

1430
01:52:05,761 --> 01:52:08,014
I think I'll stop right here.

1431
01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:12,233
Whistler, that was great!

1432
01:52:12,309 --> 01:52:14,186
Whistler!
That was great!

1433
01:52:14,269 --> 01:52:16,818
I'm taking the wheel. In the back.

1434
01:52:17,064 --> 01:52:19,032
Where's Martin?

1435
01:52:22,569 --> 01:52:23,991
Marty.

1436
01:52:27,532 --> 01:52:29,830
Would you step away
from the ladder?

1437
01:52:48,887 --> 01:52:54,018
You will give me the box right
now, or I will kill you right now.

1438
01:52:58,355 --> 01:52:59,652
No.

1439
01:53:02,276 --> 01:53:03,493
Jesus!

1440
01:53:03,568 --> 01:53:06,242
Just give me the box, Marty.

1441
01:53:06,363 --> 01:53:09,412
I thought you couldn't kill your
friend, Cos. I missed on purpose!

1442
01:53:09,533 --> 01:53:13,208
Give me the box. Take the goddamn thing!
I don't want it.

1443
01:53:13,287 --> 01:53:16,040
You win, I lose. That's
what you want, isn't it?

1444
01:53:16,123 --> 01:53:17,591
Say it! Say it!

1445
01:53:17,666 --> 01:53:18,792
Yes!

1446
01:53:24,381 --> 01:53:25,803
I'm sorry, Cos.

1447
01:53:25,882 --> 01:53:27,725
You could have shared this
with me.

1448
01:53:27,801 --> 01:53:30,304
I know. You could
have had the power.

1449
01:53:30,387 --> 01:53:31,434
I don't want it.

1450
01:53:31,513 --> 01:53:33,811
Don't you know the places
we can go with this?

1451
01:53:33,890 --> 01:53:35,984
Yeah, I do.
There's nobody there.

1452
01:53:36,059 --> 01:53:37,402
Exactly.

1453
01:53:38,145 --> 01:53:41,149
The world isn't run by weapons
anymore, or energy or money.

1454
01:53:41,231 --> 01:53:43,950
It's run by little ones and
zeroes, little bits of data.

1455
01:53:44,026 --> 01:53:45,528
It's all just electrons.

1456
01:53:45,610 --> 01:53:47,408
I don't care.

1457
01:53:47,821 --> 01:53:50,495
I don't expect other people
to understand this,

1458
01:53:50,574 --> 01:53:56,252
but I do expect you to understand this.
We started this journey together.

1459
01:53:56,330 --> 01:54:01,177
It wasn't a journey, Cos.
It was a prank.

1460
01:54:02,461 --> 01:54:06,056
There's a war out there,
old friend, a world war.

1461
01:54:06,131 --> 01:54:08,179
And it's not about
who's got the most bullets.

1462
01:54:08,258 --> 01:54:10,352
It's about
who controls the information,

1463
01:54:10,427 --> 01:54:13,351
what we see and hear,
how we work, what we think.

1464
01:54:13,430 --> 01:54:16,730
It's all about the information.

1465
01:54:16,808 --> 01:54:19,652
If I were you,
I'd destroy that thing.

1466
01:54:21,688 --> 01:54:23,565
Don't go.

1467
01:54:28,278 --> 01:54:29,700
Don't go.

1468
01:54:35,160 --> 01:54:37,663
You do what you have to do, Cos.

1469
01:54:38,789 --> 01:54:43,090
But if you want to stop me,
you'll have to pull the trigger.

1470
01:54:45,587 --> 01:54:46,713
You.

1471
01:55:39,850 --> 01:55:42,774
I can't believe we
actually made it back.

1472
01:55:42,853 --> 01:55:45,606
I can't believe we pulled off
the greatest sneak in history,

1473
01:55:45,689 --> 01:55:46,941
and we can't tell anybody.

1474
01:55:47,023 --> 01:55:50,277
You know what I can't believe?
Tomorrow's Thursday!

1475
01:55:50,360 --> 01:55:51,407
Not one word.

1476
01:55:51,486 --> 01:55:53,454
All of you, step over here.

1477
01:55:53,530 --> 01:55:55,749
Hands over your head. Move!

1478
01:55:55,824 --> 01:55:58,077
Move!

1479
01:56:00,162 --> 01:56:02,540
Mr. Bishop.

1480
01:56:09,588 --> 01:56:13,934
I'm Bernard Abbott,
National Security Agency.

1481
01:56:14,801 --> 01:56:17,645
We spoke on the phone.

1482
01:56:17,721 --> 01:56:21,897
I believe you have something
that belongs to me.

1483
01:56:25,020 --> 01:56:30,572
It's interesting, don't you think,
you guys, that the NSA is here?

1484
01:56:30,650 --> 01:56:33,529
I thought the FBI was supposed
to do this kind of thing.

1485
01:56:33,612 --> 01:56:37,412
Absolutely. This is outside
the NSA's jurisdiction.

1486
01:56:37,491 --> 01:56:42,167
Unless the NSA didn't want anybody to
know about Janek's little black box.

1487
01:56:42,245 --> 01:56:45,249
I keep thinking
about something Greg told me.

1488
01:56:45,332 --> 01:56:49,257
He said our codes were based on an entirely
different system than the Russian codes,

1489
01:56:49,336 --> 01:56:53,682
so this box
really wouldn't work on them.

1490
01:56:53,882 --> 01:56:57,182
The only thing it would really be
good for is spying on Americans.

1491
01:56:57,260 --> 01:57:00,389
Sure, with a box like that they
could read the FBI’s mail.

1492
01:57:00,472 --> 01:57:04,227
Or the CIA's.
Or the White House's.

1493
01:57:04,309 --> 01:57:08,109
No wonder they don't want to
share with the other children.

1494
01:57:09,272 --> 01:57:12,367
What do you want, Mr. Bishop?

1495
01:57:12,734 --> 01:57:16,409
Clear up my record.
Get out of my life.

1496
01:57:16,488 --> 01:57:19,037
I don't have much choice, do I?

1497
01:57:19,115 --> 01:57:22,870
Not unless you wanna
read about it in Newsweek.

1498
01:57:23,620 --> 01:57:25,543
Deal. The box.

1499
01:57:25,622 --> 01:57:27,295
Not so fast.

1500
01:57:29,918 --> 01:57:31,636
I want a Winnebago.

1501
01:57:31,711 --> 01:57:32,758
What?

1502
01:57:32,837 --> 01:57:37,388
Fully equipped, big kitchen,
water bed, microwave.

1503
01:57:37,467 --> 01:57:39,561
This is not
a car dealership, pal.

1504
01:57:39,636 --> 01:57:41,559
He wants a Winnebago.

1505
01:57:46,518 --> 01:57:48,862
All right, a Winnebago.

1506
01:57:48,937 --> 01:57:51,315
Thank you. Burgundy interior.

1507
01:57:53,024 --> 01:57:54,492
Now the box.

1508
01:57:55,986 --> 01:57:59,786
I have never taken my wife
to Europe.

1509
01:58:00,490 --> 01:58:03,369
I'm sorry to hear it.
Give me the box.

1510
01:58:03,577 --> 01:58:06,626
You will buy me two round-trip,
first-class tickets

1511
01:58:06,705 --> 01:58:11,802
to Athens, Lisbon,
Madrid and Scotland.

1512
01:58:12,586 --> 01:58:14,008
Don't forget Tahiti.

1513
01:58:14,796 --> 01:58:16,048
And Tahiti.

1514
01:58:16,131 --> 01:58:17,599
Tahiti is not in Europe.

1515
01:58:17,674 --> 01:58:19,051
Excuse me.

1516
01:58:19,538 --> 01:58:21,779
When you get the box, then you
give us geography lessons.

1517
01:58:21,803 --> 01:58:24,522
Until then,
this man goes to Tahiti.

1518
01:58:25,849 --> 01:58:28,773
Fine! Tahiti!

1519
01:58:30,520 --> 01:58:31,988
Carl?

1520
01:58:32,897 --> 01:58:36,947
The young lady
with the Uzi, is she single?

1521
01:58:37,027 --> 01:58:39,655
Carl. Excuse us.

1522
01:58:42,073 --> 01:58:46,419
This is the brass ring. You
gotta think bigger thoughts.

1523
01:58:46,494 --> 01:58:49,589
I just want her
telephone number.

1524
01:58:51,333 --> 01:58:53,552
Please?

1525
01:58:55,754 --> 01:58:58,257
How about a lunch? You
can chaperon. No.

1526
01:58:58,340 --> 01:59:00,058
I will not do this.

1527
01:59:00,634 --> 01:59:02,978
Hey, Abby, come on.

1528
01:59:03,053 --> 01:59:05,806
The FBI'd give him twins.
No!

1529
01:59:05,889 --> 01:59:08,108
Wait a second.

1530
01:59:09,643 --> 01:59:14,240
You can have anything you want, and
you're asking for my phone number?

1531
01:59:15,190 --> 01:59:16,407
Yes.

1532
01:59:18,109 --> 01:59:23,115
273-9164. Area code 415.

1533
01:59:25,241 --> 01:59:27,585
I'm Carl.
I'm Mary.

1534
01:59:27,661 --> 01:59:29,663
I'm going to be sick.

1535
01:59:29,746 --> 01:59:33,250
Are we done here?
Not yet. Whistler.

1536
01:59:36,252 --> 01:59:38,971
I want peace on earth
and goodwill toward men.

1537
01:59:39,047 --> 01:59:40,765
This is ridiculous.

1538
01:59:40,882 --> 01:59:42,350
He's serious.

1539
01:59:42,425 --> 01:59:44,894
I want peace on earth
and goodwill toward men.

1540
01:59:44,969 --> 01:59:49,065
We are the United States government.
We don't do that sort of thing.

1541
01:59:49,140 --> 01:59:51,188
You're just gonna have to try.

1542
01:59:52,143 --> 01:59:55,317
All right.
I'll see what I can do.

1543
01:59:55,772 --> 02:00:00,118
Thank you very much.
That's all I ask.

1544
02:00:02,487 --> 02:00:04,865
How about you?
What do you want?

1545
02:00:04,948 --> 02:00:06,700
Oh, I'm fine.

1546
02:00:10,787 --> 02:00:13,131
May I have the box?

1547
02:00:23,466 --> 02:00:26,811
You know it doesn't work.
It never did.

1548
02:00:27,303 --> 02:00:29,101
That's not important, is it?

1549
02:00:29,180 --> 02:00:33,151
What's really important is that
none of this ever happened.

1550
02:00:33,226 --> 02:00:36,150
This box doesn't exist.

1551
02:00:37,689 --> 02:00:39,612
I never saw it before.

1552
02:00:39,691 --> 02:00:41,284
Remember that.

1553
02:00:51,369 --> 02:00:52,837
Bishop?

1554
02:00:53,913 --> 02:00:56,757
All you did
was say it was broken.

1555
02:00:58,001 --> 02:01:02,347
Can't they still just hook it up
and do terrible things with it?

1556
02:01:05,008 --> 02:01:06,430
Nope.

1557
02:01:07,510 --> 02:01:08,727
<i>In a surprise announcement,</i>

1558
02:01:08,803 --> 02:01:12,307
<i>the Republican National Committee
