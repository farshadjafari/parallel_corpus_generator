1
00:02:40,029 --> 00:02:41,690
Robin Williger.

2
00:02:41,797 --> 00:02:45,392
He is a 15-year-old freshman
from Racine, Wisconsin.

3
00:02:45,501 --> 00:02:47,196
He enjoys studying history.

4
00:02:47,302 --> 00:02:48,929
He's on the debate team.

5
00:02:49,038 --> 00:02:52,303
Robin's future looked
very, very bright,

6
00:02:52,408 --> 00:02:54,239
but recently he was
diagnosed with cancer,

7
00:02:54,343 --> 00:02:56,949
a very tough kind of cancer.

8
00:02:57,059 --> 00:02:59,572
Robin tells me he has
quit smoking, though,

9
00:02:59,682 --> 00:03:02,913
and he no longer thinks
that cigarettes are cool.

10
00:03:07,056 --> 00:03:09,354
Whoo!

11
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:12,723
And our final guest today
is Nick Naylor.

12
00:03:12,828 --> 00:03:17,390
Mr. Naylor is the vice president
of the Academy of Tobacco Studies.

13
00:03:17,499 --> 00:03:20,525
Now, they are the tobacco
industry's main lobby

14
00:03:20,636 --> 00:03:21,933
in Washington, D.C.

15
00:03:22,037 --> 00:03:25,097
and Mr. Naylor is
their chief spokesman.

16
00:03:43,092 --> 00:03:44,889
Few people on this planet know

17
00:03:44,993 --> 00:03:47,120
what it is to be truly despised.

18
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:49,459
Can you blame them?

19
00:03:49,565 --> 00:03:51,931
I earn a living
fronting an organization

20
00:03:52,034 --> 00:03:55,299
that kills 1,200 human beings a day.

21
00:03:55,404 --> 00:03:56,598
1,200 people.

22
00:03:56,705 --> 00:03:59,196
We're talking
two jumbojet plane loads

23
00:03:59,308 --> 00:04:02,004
of men, women and children.

24
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:03,135
I mean, there's Attila,

25
00:04:03,245 --> 00:04:04,769
Genghis,

26
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,778
and me,

27
00:04:05,881 --> 00:04:07,143
Nick Naylor,

28
00:04:07,249 --> 00:04:08,273
the face of cigarettes...

29
00:04:08,383 --> 00:04:11,147
the Colonel Sanders of nicotine.

30
00:04:11,253 --> 00:04:12,720
This is where I work,

31
00:04:12,821 --> 00:04:15,346
the Academy of Tobacco Studies.

32
00:04:15,457 --> 00:04:17,618
It was established
by seven gentlemen

33
00:04:17,726 --> 00:04:19,318
you may recognize from C-SPAN.

34
00:04:19,428 --> 00:04:22,056
These guys realized quick
if they were going to claim

35
00:04:22,164 --> 00:04:23,256
that cigarettes were not addictive,

36
00:04:23,365 --> 00:04:25,526
they better have proof.

37
00:04:25,634 --> 00:04:27,465
This is the man they rely on,

38
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:29,696
Erhardt Von Grupten Mundt.

39
00:04:29,805 --> 00:04:32,069
They found him in Germany.

40
00:04:32,174 --> 00:04:33,698
I won't go into the details.

41
00:04:33,809 --> 00:04:34,969
He's been testing the link

42
00:04:35,077 --> 00:04:36,305
between nicotine
and lung cancer

43
00:04:36,411 --> 00:04:39,676
for 30 years and hasn't found
any conclusive results.

44
00:04:39,782 --> 00:04:40,680
The man's a genius.

45
00:04:40,783 --> 00:04:42,444
He could disprove gravity.

46
00:04:42,551 --> 00:04:44,212
Then we've got our sharks.

47
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:46,082
We draft them out
of Ivy League law schools

48
00:04:46,188 --> 00:04:48,486
and give them time-shares
and sports cars.

49
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,148
It's just like
a John Grisham novel-

50
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:52,819
you know, without all the espionage.

51
00:04:52,928 --> 00:04:56,159
Most importantly,
we've got spin control.

52
00:04:56,265 --> 00:04:58,096
That's where I come in.

53
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,565
I get paid to talk.

54
00:04:59,668 --> 00:05:01,226
I don't have an MD or law degree.

55
00:05:03,672 --> 00:05:06,835
I have a bachelor's in
kicking ass and taking names.

56
00:05:06,942 --> 00:05:09,376
You know that guy
who can pick up any girl?

57
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:10,536
I'm him

58
00:05:10,646 --> 00:05:11,738
on crack.

59
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,041
This is obviously a heated issue

60
00:05:17,152 --> 00:05:19,848
and we do have a lot
that we want to cover today.

61
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:22,051
Nick, do you have a question?

62
00:05:22,157 --> 00:05:23,249
Joan,

63
00:05:23,358 --> 00:05:27,158
how on earth would
Big Tobacco profit

64
00:05:27,262 --> 00:05:29,696
off of the loss of this young man?

65
00:05:29,798 --> 00:05:31,993
Now, I hate to think
in such callous terms,

66
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,194
but, if anything,
we'd be losing a customer.

67
00:05:35,304 --> 00:05:38,398
It's not only our hope,
it's in our best interest

68
00:05:38,507 --> 00:05:40,737
to keep Robin alive and smoking.

69
00:05:40,843 --> 00:05:42,504
- That's ludicrous.
- Let me tell you something,

70
00:05:42,611 --> 00:05:44,442
Joan, and please,
let me share something

71
00:05:44,546 --> 00:05:48,175
with the fine, concerned
people in the audience today.

72
00:05:48,283 --> 00:05:51,844
The Ron Goodes of this world...

73
00:05:51,954 --> 00:05:54,514
want the Robin Willigers to die.

74
00:05:54,623 --> 00:05:55,715
- What?
You know why?

75
00:05:55,824 --> 00:05:57,416
So that their budgets will go up.

76
00:05:57,526 --> 00:06:00,393
This is nothing less than
trafficking in human misery,

77
00:06:00,495 --> 00:06:02,258
and you, sir, ought
to be ashamed of yourself.

78
00:06:02,364 --> 00:06:03,854
I ought to be ashamed of myself?

79
00:06:03,966 --> 00:06:07,094
As a matter of fact,
we're about to launch...

80
00:06:07,202 --> 00:06:10,194
a $50 million campaign

81
00:06:10,305 --> 00:06:14,469
aimed at persuading kids
not to smoke.

82
00:06:14,576 --> 00:06:16,737
Because I think
that we can all agree

83
00:06:16,845 --> 00:06:18,972
that there is nothing
more important

84
00:06:19,081 --> 00:06:20,412
than America's children.

85
00:06:20,515 --> 00:06:21,880
All right, now,
that's something that

86
00:06:21,984 --> 00:06:23,747
we're going to want
to know more about.

87
00:06:23,852 --> 00:06:25,012
but I have to take a short break.

88
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,213
Hang on, a lot more coming.

89
00:06:30,192 --> 00:06:33,127
$50 million?! Are you
out of your fucking mind?!

90
00:06:33,228 --> 00:06:34,126
Everyone has a boss.

91
00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:35,127
BR just happens

92
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,754
to be mine.

93
00:06:36,865 --> 00:06:38,730
He came from the vending
machine world.

94
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:40,495
This made him tough.

95
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:45,067
The name BR came
from his tour in Vietnam.

96
00:06:45,173 --> 00:06:48,267
The people who know
its meaning are all dead.

97
00:06:48,377 --> 00:06:49,810
The deal was five million!

98
00:06:49,912 --> 00:06:52,676
$5 million will get you
a couple of subway posters.

99
00:06:52,781 --> 00:06:53,713
It's not going to impress anyone.

100
00:06:53,815 --> 00:06:54,975
That's the idea, Nick.

101
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,015
You'll be thanking me soon.

102
00:06:56,118 --> 00:06:57,278
This'll probably get you great press.

103
00:06:57,386 --> 00:06:59,752
I gotta call the captain
and see if this is gonna fly.

104
00:06:59,855 --> 00:07:01,948
Get your ass back to D.C.

105
00:07:15,771 --> 00:07:17,739
Thank you so much for coming.

106
00:07:19,574 --> 00:07:20,472
Mr. Naylor?

107
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,564
It's your turn.

108
00:07:21,677 --> 00:07:24,009
Ah.

109
00:07:24,112 --> 00:07:26,171
Joey is such a bright young man.

110
00:07:26,281 --> 00:07:27,248
We all look forward

111
00:07:27,349 --> 00:07:29,112
to his coming out
of his shell a little.

112
00:07:29,217 --> 00:07:30,445
He's a bit shy.

113
00:07:30,552 --> 00:07:32,349
Yeah, he gets that from his mother.

114
00:07:41,496 --> 00:07:44,260
Hey, Joey.

115
00:07:44,366 --> 00:07:46,732
Please don't ruin my childhood.

116
00:07:46,835 --> 00:07:48,894
Come on, Joey. Trust me.

117
00:07:56,812 --> 00:07:59,872
How many of you want to be
lawyers when you grow up?

118
00:07:59,982 --> 00:08:00,971
Right.

119
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,573
How about...

120
00:08:02,684 --> 00:08:04,413
movie stars?

121
00:08:05,854 --> 00:08:06,980
How about lobbyists?

122
00:08:07,089 --> 00:08:08,021
What's that?

123
00:08:08,123 --> 00:08:10,057
It's kind of like being a movie star.

124
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:11,921
It's what I do.
I talk for a living.

125
00:08:12,027 --> 00:08:13,187
What do you talk about?

126
00:08:13,295 --> 00:08:15,354
I speak on behalf of cigarettes.

127
00:08:15,464 --> 00:08:16,692
My mom used to smoke.

128
00:08:16,798 --> 00:08:19,426
She says that cigarettes kill.

129
00:08:19,534 --> 00:08:21,934
Really? Now, is your mommy a doctor?

130
00:08:22,037 --> 00:08:22,935
No.

131
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:24,767
A scientific researcher of some kind?

132
00:08:24,873 --> 00:08:26,101
No.

133
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,140
Well, she doesn't exactly sound

134
00:08:27,242 --> 00:08:28,641
like a credible expert,
now, does she?

135
00:08:30,178 --> 00:08:31,076
Don't feel bad.

136
00:08:31,179 --> 00:08:33,079
It's okay to listen to your mom.

137
00:08:33,181 --> 00:08:35,547
I mean, it's good to listen
to your parents... Joey.

138
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,948
All I'm suggesting

139
00:08:38,053 --> 00:08:40,453
is that there will always
be people trying to tell you

140
00:08:40,555 --> 00:08:42,716
what to do and what to think.

141
00:08:42,824 --> 00:08:44,189
There probably already are
people doing that.

142
00:08:44,292 --> 00:08:45,190
Am I right?

143
00:08:45,293 --> 00:08:46,225
Yes.

144
00:08:46,328 --> 00:08:48,091
I'm here to say

145
00:08:48,196 --> 00:08:51,632
that when someone tries to act
like some sort of an expert,

146
00:08:51,733 --> 00:08:55,225
you can respond, "Who says?"

147
00:08:55,337 --> 00:08:57,032
So, cigarettes are good for you?

148
00:08:57,139 --> 00:08:59,039
- No!
- No, that's not...

149
00:08:59,141 --> 00:09:00,301
That's not what I'm getting at.

150
00:09:00,409 --> 00:09:02,741
My point is that you have
to think for yourself.

151
00:09:02,844 --> 00:09:04,573
You have to challenge authority.

152
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:06,943
If your parents told you
that chocolate was dangerous,

153
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:08,573
would you just take their word for it?

154
00:09:08,683 --> 00:09:09,775
No.

155
00:09:09,885 --> 00:09:10,874
Exactly.

156
00:09:10,986 --> 00:09:12,817
So perhaps instead of acting
like sheep

157
00:09:12,921 --> 00:09:13,888
when it comes to cigarettes,

158
00:09:13,989 --> 00:09:15,422
you should find out for yourself.

159
00:09:15,524 --> 00:09:16,650
Okay, then.

160
00:09:16,758 --> 00:09:19,124
Thank you, Mr. Naylor,
for joining us.

161
00:09:28,603 --> 00:09:31,163
Every week we meet here at Bert's.

162
00:09:31,273 --> 00:09:33,264
Together, we represent
the chief spokespeople

163
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:36,344
for the tobacco, alcohol and
firearms industries.

164
00:09:36,445 --> 00:09:37,571
We call ourselves the MOD Squad.

165
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:38,577
All right.

166
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,342
M-O-D, Merchants of Death.

167
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,610
So, my day's ruined.

168
00:09:42,717 --> 00:09:43,615
Why?

169
00:09:43,718 --> 00:09:44,946
Dateline's doing a segment

170
00:09:45,053 --> 00:09:46,645
on fetal alcohol syndrome.
Thank you.

171
00:09:46,755 --> 00:09:48,689
Polly works
for the Moderation Council.

172
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:51,088
A casual drinker
by the age of 14,

173
00:09:51,193 --> 00:09:52,455
Polly quickly developed

174
00:09:52,561 --> 00:09:55,962
a tolerance usually reserved
for Irish dockworkers.

175
00:09:56,064 --> 00:09:57,895
In our world, she's the woman

176
00:09:57,999 --> 00:10:00,160
that got the pope
to endorse red wine.

177
00:10:03,138 --> 00:10:04,070
We're gonna get creamed.

178
00:10:04,172 --> 00:10:05,434
Any ideas?

179
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,837
I don't know.

180
00:10:06,942 --> 00:10:09,274
Deformed kids are tough.

181
00:10:09,377 --> 00:10:11,641
I'm lucky my product only makes
them bald before it kills them.

182
00:10:11,746 --> 00:10:13,646
You could hug the kids.

183
00:10:13,748 --> 00:10:15,716
They're not going
to let me hug the kids.

184
00:10:15,817 --> 00:10:17,375
Who's doing the segment,
Donaldson or Sawyer?

185
00:10:17,486 --> 00:10:18,384
Sawyer, probably.

186
00:10:18,487 --> 00:10:19,385
You're fucked.

187
00:10:19,488 --> 00:10:20,386
Why?

188
00:10:20,489 --> 00:10:21,615
Cause she's gonna hug them.

189
00:10:21,723 --> 00:10:23,918
Look, if you see her going in
for a hug,

190
00:10:24,025 --> 00:10:26,858
maybe just box her out,
get in there before she does.

191
00:10:26,962 --> 00:10:28,554
BobbyJay works for SAFETY,

192
00:10:28,663 --> 00:10:30,893
- the Society for the Advancement of Firearms

193
00:10:30,999 --> 00:10:32,796
and Effective Training for Youth.

194
00:10:32,901 --> 00:10:35,199
You want me to smile?

195
00:10:36,972 --> 00:10:39,372
After watching the footage
of the Kent State shootings,

196
00:10:39,474 --> 00:10:42,307
BobbyJay, then 17, signed up
for the National Guard

197
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,503
so he, too, could shoot
college students.

198
00:10:44,613 --> 00:10:47,081
But the National Guard
recruiter was out to lunch,

199
00:10:47,182 --> 00:10:50,345
so BobbyJay ended up
shooting Panamanians instead,

200
00:10:50,452 --> 00:10:52,113
which was almost as good
as college students.

201
00:10:53,355 --> 00:10:55,152
Only they shoot back.

202
00:10:55,257 --> 00:10:56,918
You know, you can beat
a Breathalyzer

203
00:10:57,025 --> 00:11:00,017
- by sucking on activated charcoal tablets?
- Really?

204
00:11:00,128 --> 00:11:01,686
Maybe we should change
our campaign to

205
00:11:01,796 --> 00:11:03,764
"If You Must Drink and Drive,
Suck Charcoal."

206
00:11:03,865 --> 00:11:04,923
Yeah, but don't the police wonder

207
00:11:05,033 --> 00:11:05,931
why you're sucking on charcoal?

208
00:11:06,034 --> 00:11:07,831
There's no law against charcoal.

209
00:11:07,936 --> 00:11:09,426
- Yet.
- Yet.

210
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:17,301
Dad, why is the American
government the best government?

211
00:11:17,412 --> 00:11:18,936
Because of our
endless appeals system.

212
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:24,575
Joe, you're not writing down
what I just said are you?

213
00:11:24,686 --> 00:11:25,846
Mm-hmm.

214
00:11:25,954 --> 00:11:27,945
Joey, stop for a second.

215
00:11:28,056 --> 00:11:29,546
What is the subject of your essay?

216
00:11:29,658 --> 00:11:32,456
Why is American government
the best government in the world.

217
00:11:32,561 --> 00:11:34,188
Your teacher crafted that question?

218
00:11:34,296 --> 00:11:36,059
Yeah. Why?

219
00:11:36,164 --> 00:11:38,962
Well... I'll look past
the obvious problems

220
00:11:39,067 --> 00:11:40,364
in syntax for a moment,

221
00:11:40,468 --> 00:11:42,561
and I'll focus more on the core
of the question.

222
00:11:42,671 --> 00:11:43,865
I mean, "A,"

223
00:11:43,972 --> 00:11:46,600
does America have
the best government in the world?

224
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,369
And "B," what constitutes
a "best government"?

225
00:11:48,476 --> 00:11:50,910
Is it crime, is it poverty, literacy?

226
00:11:51,012 --> 00:11:52,445
Hmm?

227
00:11:52,547 --> 00:11:53,479
And America- definitely not best.

228
00:11:53,582 --> 00:11:54,776
Perhaps not even better than most.

229
00:11:54,883 --> 00:11:56,248
We do have a very
entertaining government...

230
00:11:56,351 --> 00:11:57,648
Dad.

231
00:11:57,752 --> 00:11:59,583
I'm sorry.

232
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:03,323
Are you familiar with the term "B.S."?

233
00:12:03,425 --> 00:12:04,983
Bullshit.

234
00:12:05,093 --> 00:12:06,355
Yes, exactly.

235
00:12:06,461 --> 00:12:09,362
B.S., if I may, is what
questions like the one

236
00:12:09,464 --> 00:12:11,364
your teacher posed are made for.

237
00:12:11,466 --> 00:12:13,400
Because even if America
had the best government,

238
00:12:13,501 --> 00:12:15,025
there'd be no way to prove it.

239
00:12:15,136 --> 00:12:16,467
And how many pages are you writing?

240
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:17,469
Two pages.

241
00:12:17,572 --> 00:12:19,164
Two pages...

242
00:12:19,274 --> 00:12:20,832
Definitely not in two pages.

243
00:12:20,942 --> 00:12:23,103
So what am I supposed to write?

244
00:12:23,211 --> 00:12:24,906
You can write whatever you want.

245
00:12:25,013 --> 00:12:26,412
Okay.

246
00:12:26,514 --> 00:12:27,503
Write about...

247
00:12:27,616 --> 00:12:30,016
write about America's
amazing ability

248
00:12:30,118 --> 00:12:33,110
to make profit by breaking down
trading tariffs

249
00:12:33,221 --> 00:12:35,587
and bringing American jobs
to Third World countries.

250
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:37,624
Or how good we are
at executing felons.

251
00:12:37,726 --> 00:12:39,353
They're all correct answers.

252
00:12:39,461 --> 00:12:41,429
I can do that?

253
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:43,053
See, Joey, that's the beauty
of argument.

254
00:12:43,164 --> 00:12:45,564
'Cause if you argue correctly,
you're never wrong.

255
00:12:53,275 --> 00:12:56,176
Dad, if I finish
this essay within an hour,

256
00:12:56,278 --> 00:12:58,041
can we stay up all night?

257
00:12:58,146 --> 00:13:02,810
That's a negotiation,
not an argument.

258
00:13:02,917 --> 00:13:05,647
Well, Conway, see you made it.

259
00:13:05,754 --> 00:13:07,779
Yeah, I guess that little
voice was wrong.

260
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:08,981
I feel better.

261
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,250
I feel a lot better, too.

262
00:13:10,358 --> 00:13:12,918
As a matter of fact, I never
felt so good in my life.

263
00:13:13,028 --> 00:13:14,620
How about a cigarette?

264
00:13:31,479 --> 00:13:32,571
Is he...?

265
00:13:32,681 --> 00:13:33,773
Yeah.

266
00:13:35,884 --> 00:13:39,320
Hey.

267
00:13:39,421 --> 00:13:42,857
Nick, you still own a watch, don't you?

268
00:13:42,957 --> 00:13:44,151
Jill, I can't help feeling

269
00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:45,783
Joey's getting the wrong idea
about his dad.

270
00:13:45,894 --> 00:13:47,418
It would be great if I could spend

271
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:49,053
a little more time with him,
you know?

272
00:13:49,164 --> 00:13:52,656
To give him a fair
and balanced perspective.

273
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,632
Nick, you had plenty
of time for that.

274
00:13:54,736 --> 00:13:56,203
Now you're his weekend guardian.

275
00:13:56,304 --> 00:13:58,329
Besides, he has Brad.

276
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,532
He still needs his father.

277
00:13:59,641 --> 00:14:01,836
Nick.

278
00:14:01,943 --> 00:14:03,035
You have a second?

279
00:14:04,746 --> 00:14:06,077
Sure, Brad.

280
00:14:06,181 --> 00:14:09,947
Nick, your job
and everything aside,

281
00:14:10,051 --> 00:14:11,985
I hope you understand
that secondhand smoke's

282
00:14:12,087 --> 00:14:13,782
a real killer.

283
00:14:13,888 --> 00:14:15,753
What are you talking about?

284
00:14:15,857 --> 00:14:17,484
I just hope you're providing

285
00:14:17,592 --> 00:14:20,152
a smoke-free environment
for Joey, that's all I'm saying.

286
00:14:20,261 --> 00:14:22,456
Brad, I'm his father.

287
00:14:22,564 --> 00:14:24,896
You're the guy fucking his mom.

288
00:14:27,302 --> 00:14:29,600
That was unnecessary.

289
00:14:29,771 --> 00:14:33,207
Thank you all.
Thank you all for coming.

290
00:14:33,308 --> 00:14:35,776
Tobacco is winning the war.

291
00:14:35,877 --> 00:14:39,074
The war against our children.

292
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,479
They like to use cartoons
and symbols to hook our kids.

293
00:14:42,584 --> 00:14:45,451
Well, now we have
a symbol of our own.

294
00:14:45,553 --> 00:14:47,748
Doctor.

295
00:14:47,856 --> 00:14:50,620
It is my hope that
within the year

296
00:14:50,725 --> 00:14:52,420
every cigarette package

297
00:14:52,527 --> 00:14:55,553
sold in America
will carry this symbol.

298
00:14:55,663 --> 00:14:57,893
Perhaps then, cigarettes
will finally be labeled

299
00:14:57,999 --> 00:15:01,093
appropriately as poison.

300
00:15:01,202 --> 00:15:03,067
I will be holding
a congressional hearing

301
00:15:03,171 --> 00:15:05,901
to discuss the inclusion
of the skull and crossbones

302
00:15:06,007 --> 00:15:07,474
in the next two weeks.

303
00:15:07,575 --> 00:15:08,974
As usual, I extend
an open invitation

304
00:15:09,077 --> 00:15:11,568
to big tobacco.

305
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:15,672
Perhaps this time they will
grace us with their presence.

306
00:15:15,784 --> 00:15:17,081
And their answers.

307
00:15:17,185 --> 00:15:18,584
Thank you very much.

308
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:26,727
People, what is going on out there?

309
00:15:26,828 --> 00:15:30,457
I look down this table,
all I see are white flags.

310
00:15:30,565 --> 00:15:33,193
Our numbers are down
all across the board.

311
00:15:33,301 --> 00:15:35,166
Teen smoking-
our bread and butter,

312
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,999
is falling like a shit from heaven.

313
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,801
We don't sell Tic Tacs,
for Christ's sake.

314
00:15:40,909 --> 00:15:42,570
We sell cigarettes.

315
00:15:42,677 --> 00:15:46,613
And they're cool and available
and addictive.

316
00:15:46,714 --> 00:15:48,341
The job is almost done for us.

317
00:15:50,118 --> 00:15:55,021
This environmentalist
is challenging us.

318
00:15:55,123 --> 00:15:57,683
We have to have an answer.

319
00:15:57,792 --> 00:15:59,487
I'm asking you,

320
00:15:59,594 --> 00:16:01,425
when this cocksucker puts
Captain Hook on our products,

321
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:03,053
what the fuck are we going to do?

322
00:16:03,164 --> 00:16:05,724
- BR.
- Yeah, Nick.

323
00:16:05,834 --> 00:16:07,028
If I may.

324
00:16:07,135 --> 00:16:09,569
In 1910,

325
00:16:09,671 --> 00:16:12,162
the U.S. was producing
ten billion cigarettes a year.

326
00:16:12,273 --> 00:16:13,399
By 1930,

327
00:16:13,508 --> 00:16:15,476
we were up to 123 billion.

328
00:16:15,577 --> 00:16:17,545
What happened in between?

329
00:16:17,645 --> 00:16:19,306
Three things.

330
00:16:19,414 --> 00:16:20,381
A world war,

331
00:16:20,482 --> 00:16:24,350
dieting... and movies.

332
00:16:24,452 --> 00:16:25,680
Movies?

333
00:16:25,787 --> 00:16:28,813
1927-talking pictures are born.

334
00:16:28,923 --> 00:16:31,153
Suddenly, directors need to give
their actors

335
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:33,193
something to do
while they're talking.

336
00:16:33,294 --> 00:16:35,990
Cary Grant, Carole Lombard
are lighting up.

337
00:16:36,097 --> 00:16:37,564
Bette Davis- a chimney.

338
00:16:37,665 --> 00:16:38,962
And Bogart-
remember the first picture

339
00:16:39,067 --> 00:16:40,125
with him and Lauren Bacall?

340
00:16:40,235 --> 00:16:42,703
Well, yea... not specifically.

341
00:16:42,804 --> 00:16:44,066
Oh, she sort

342
00:16:44,172 --> 00:16:46,265
of shimmies in
through the doorway,

343
00:16:46,374 --> 00:16:48,467
19 years old.

344
00:16:48,576 --> 00:16:50,043
Pure sex.

345
00:16:50,144 --> 00:16:51,042
She says,

346
00:16:51,145 --> 00:16:53,375
"Anyone got a match?"

347
00:16:53,481 --> 00:16:55,176
And Bogie throws
the matches at her...

348
00:16:56,684 --> 00:16:58,584
and she catches them.

349
00:16:58,686 --> 00:17:02,247
Greatest romance of the century.

350
00:17:02,357 --> 00:17:04,518
How'd it start?
Lighting a cigarette.

351
00:17:04,626 --> 00:17:07,094
These days when someone
smokes in the movies,

352
00:17:07,195 --> 00:17:10,426
they're either a psychopath
or a European.

353
00:17:10,532 --> 00:17:12,432
The message Hollywood
needs to send out

354
00:17:12,534 --> 00:17:14,502
is smoking is cool.

355
00:17:14,602 --> 00:17:16,900
We need the cast of Will and Grace

356
00:17:17,005 --> 00:17:18,370
smoking in their living room.

357
00:17:18,473 --> 00:17:20,703
Forrest Gump puffing away
between his box of chocolates.

358
00:17:20,808 --> 00:17:24,209
Hugh Grant earning back
the love of Julia Roberts

359
00:17:24,312 --> 00:17:28,612
by buying her favorite brand-
her Virginia Slims.

360
00:17:28,716 --> 00:17:32,243
Most of the actors smoke already.

361
00:17:32,353 --> 00:17:34,583
If they start doing it on-screen,

362
00:17:34,689 --> 00:17:37,385
we can put the sex
back into cigarettes.

363
00:17:37,492 --> 00:17:40,052
Well, it's a thought.

364
00:17:40,161 --> 00:17:41,958
I was hoping for something
a little more inspiring,

365
00:17:42,063 --> 00:17:43,087
but at least you're thinking.

366
00:17:43,197 --> 00:17:44,562
Rest of you people,
slam your fucking brains

367
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:45,564
against your desks

368
00:17:45,667 --> 00:17:48,261
until something useful comes out.

369
00:17:48,369 --> 00:17:50,269
That was awesome.

370
00:17:50,371 --> 00:17:51,395
Thank you.

371
00:17:51,506 --> 00:17:53,497
Nick, you've been summoned.

372
00:17:53,608 --> 00:17:54,597
Captain wants to see you.

373
00:17:54,709 --> 00:17:56,040
He saw the Joan show.

374
00:17:56,144 --> 00:17:57,236
What'd he think?

375
00:17:57,345 --> 00:17:59,142
Get your ass on the next flight
to Winston-Salem.

376
00:18:02,684 --> 00:18:04,618
Most people have this image
in their heads

377
00:18:04,719 --> 00:18:06,812
of tobacco executives
jet-setting around the world

378
00:18:06,921 --> 00:18:09,116
on private planes,
eating foie gras

379
00:18:09,223 --> 00:18:10,588
as they count their money.

380
00:18:10,692 --> 00:18:12,819
Not me.

381
00:18:12,927 --> 00:18:15,225
I like to ride with the people.

382
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:16,854
Know your clients.

383
00:18:16,965 --> 00:18:19,160
My people cram themselves
into a tiny seat,

384
00:18:19,267 --> 00:18:21,132
pop a Xanax and dream
of the moment

385
00:18:21,235 --> 00:18:24,170
they can stuff their face
with fresh tobacco.

386
00:18:24,272 --> 00:18:27,036
If I can convince just one of
these kids to pick up smoking,

387
00:18:27,141 --> 00:18:29,405
I've paid for my flight-round-trip.

388
00:18:37,852 --> 00:18:41,652
The Captain is the last great
man of tobacco.

389
00:18:41,756 --> 00:18:43,485
He introduced filters

390
00:18:43,591 --> 00:18:47,049
when cigarettes first got
slammed by Reader's Digest.

391
00:18:47,161 --> 00:18:51,530
Later, he founded
the Academy of Tobacco Studies.

392
00:18:51,633 --> 00:18:54,500
The club was founded
by the tobacco barons in 1890

393
00:18:54,602 --> 00:18:58,038
so they'd have a place
to get away from their wives.

394
00:19:00,475 --> 00:19:04,002
Here, the Captain is a legend-

395
00:19:04,112 --> 00:19:06,444
a self-made man who started
from nothing,

396
00:19:06,547 --> 00:19:09,345
and ended up with everything...

397
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:12,647
except, evidently, a son.

398
00:19:12,754 --> 00:19:14,984
Nick, my boy.

399
00:19:15,089 --> 00:19:18,183
You're just in time for mud.

400
00:19:18,292 --> 00:19:19,884
Thank you.

401
00:19:19,994 --> 00:19:21,689
Sit down there. Yeah.

402
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:26,227
Yeah.

403
00:19:26,334 --> 00:19:28,325
You know the secret
to a really good julep?

404
00:19:28,436 --> 00:19:30,131
No, sir.

405
00:19:30,238 --> 00:19:32,604
Well, you crush the mint

406
00:19:32,707 --> 00:19:35,801
down onto the ice with your thumb

407
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:38,344
and you grind it in, see?

408
00:19:38,446 --> 00:19:41,074
And it releases the menthol.

409
00:19:42,684 --> 00:19:43,673
Hmm.

410
00:19:43,785 --> 00:19:45,184
Now you know who taught me that?

411
00:19:45,286 --> 00:19:46,218
No, sir. Who?

412
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,117
Fidel Castro.

413
00:19:52,593 --> 00:19:54,686
Do you remember 1952?

414
00:19:54,796 --> 00:19:58,027
Well, sir, I wasn't alive in 1952.

415
00:19:58,132 --> 00:20:02,865
Good Lord, I was in Korea
shooting Chinese in 1952.

416
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,131
Really?

417
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:07,503
Today they're our best customer.

418
00:20:07,608 --> 00:20:10,236
Next time we won't have to shoot
so many of them, will we?

419
00:20:10,344 --> 00:20:12,073
No, sir.

420
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:16,173
1952 was the year
Reader's Digest

421
00:20:16,284 --> 00:20:19,151
nailed us with
the whole health aspect.

422
00:20:19,253 --> 00:20:21,744
As Churchill said,

423
00:20:21,856 --> 00:20:24,120
that was perhaps the end
of our beginning.

424
00:20:24,225 --> 00:20:27,558
Tell me,

425
00:20:27,662 --> 00:20:29,596
do you enjoy your current work, Nick?

426
00:20:29,697 --> 00:20:30,664
Yes, sir.

427
00:20:30,765 --> 00:20:32,198
It's challenging...

428
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,895
If you can do tobacco,
you can do anything.

429
00:20:36,003 --> 00:20:38,836
Yes, sir, I like that.

430
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,340
You know, Nick, you remind me

431
00:20:41,442 --> 00:20:43,672
just a little bit
of myself when I was your age.

432
00:20:43,778 --> 00:20:46,406
Well, thank you, sir.

433
00:20:46,514 --> 00:20:48,345
Like that Joan Lunden show you did.

434
00:20:48,449 --> 00:20:50,713
You could have given up,
cried, apologized,

435
00:20:50,818 --> 00:20:51,807
but you didn't.

436
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,853
You stayed loyal.

437
00:20:53,955 --> 00:20:58,824
And you gave it
to that son of a bitch good.

438
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:01,486
My pleasure.

439
00:21:04,632 --> 00:21:07,795
Now, BR's come under the idea

440
00:21:07,902 --> 00:21:10,666
that we should start bribing
producers in Hollywood

441
00:21:10,772 --> 00:21:14,435
to make the actors smoke on screen.

442
00:21:14,542 --> 00:21:17,534
You know, like in the old days.

443
00:21:17,645 --> 00:21:19,909
Say, that's, uh...

444
00:21:20,014 --> 00:21:22,278
that's a great idea.

445
00:21:22,383 --> 00:21:23,816
Mm-hmm.

446
00:21:23,918 --> 00:21:25,442
Smart man, that BR.

447
00:21:25,553 --> 00:21:27,077
Oh, yeah, yeah.

448
00:21:27,188 --> 00:21:28,712
And loyal.

449
00:21:48,342 --> 00:21:49,274
Yes, sir?

450
00:21:49,377 --> 00:21:51,242
Have a seat, Ron.

451
00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:06,392
You, see, Ron, I can't be
everywhere I'm needed.

452
00:22:06,494 --> 00:22:08,394
That's why I send
people like you

453
00:22:08,496 --> 00:22:09,827
to speak on my behalf.

454
00:22:09,931 --> 00:22:13,594
When you're there,
you're not Ron Goode,

455
00:22:13,701 --> 00:22:15,669
the guy your friends probably like,

456
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:18,330
you're Senator Finistirre's aide,

457
00:22:18,439 --> 00:22:21,704
and your name really doesn't matter.

458
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:23,709
So, when

459
00:22:23,811 --> 00:22:26,507
Ron Goode acts
like a complete asshole

460
00:22:26,614 --> 00:22:29,310
on the Joan Lunden Show,

461
00:22:29,417 --> 00:22:32,511
I am being an asshole
on the Joan Lunden Show.

462
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,281
Senator, sir, he sprang on me like...

463
00:22:34,388 --> 00:22:37,585
Where in the hell
did you find cancer boy?

464
00:22:37,692 --> 00:22:40,126
He was supposed to be quite reliable.

465
00:22:40,228 --> 00:22:43,061
The Pulmonary Council
was one of his references.

466
00:22:43,164 --> 00:22:44,859
Fucking nonprofits.

467
00:22:48,603 --> 00:22:51,333
When you're looking
for a cancer kid,

468
00:22:51,439 --> 00:22:52,736
he should be hopeless.

469
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,398
He should have a wheelchair.

470
00:22:54,508 --> 00:22:56,669
He should have trouble talking.

471
00:22:56,777 --> 00:22:59,507
He should have
a little pet goldfish

472
00:22:59,614 --> 00:23:01,206
he carries around
in a ziplock bag-

473
00:23:01,315 --> 00:23:02,373
hopeless.

474
00:23:02,483 --> 00:23:04,747
I apologize, sir, but if it wasn't

475
00:23:04,852 --> 00:23:06,183
- for Nick Naylor...
- Nick Naylor?

476
00:23:08,089 --> 00:23:12,458
Don't you even think
of using him as an excuse.

477
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,551
The man shills bullshit for a living.

478
00:23:14,662 --> 00:23:16,630
You work for a fucking senator.

479
00:23:16,731 --> 00:23:18,995
A senator who is supposed
to be tough on tobacco.

480
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,967
Have a little... pride,
for God's sake.

481
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:26,301
It won't happen again, sir,
I promise.

482
00:23:28,943 --> 00:23:32,470
All right, you're excused.

483
00:23:38,352 --> 00:23:39,683
Sometimes I feel like

484
00:23:39,787 --> 00:23:42,483
a Colombian drug dealer.

485
00:23:44,292 --> 00:23:48,854
The other day, my own granddaughter,
flesh of flesh of my own loins,

486
00:23:48,963 --> 00:23:52,330
asked me, "Granddaddy, is it true

487
00:23:52,433 --> 00:23:55,300
cigarettes are bad for you?"

488
00:23:57,705 --> 00:24:00,265
We got to do something, Nick.

489
00:24:00,374 --> 00:24:01,636
I think you're our man.

490
00:24:01,742 --> 00:24:03,471
Thank you, sir.

491
00:24:03,577 --> 00:24:05,841
I want you to work
on this Hollywood project.

492
00:24:05,947 --> 00:24:08,438
Get out there the next
few weeks, stir things up

493
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:12,485
and report directly to me.

494
00:24:12,586 --> 00:24:13,644
Sir, about the,

495
00:24:13,754 --> 00:24:16,814
the $50 million.

496
00:24:16,924 --> 00:24:19,825
Anti teen-smoking advertising.

497
00:24:19,927 --> 00:24:23,419
Well, shit, I sure hope
it's not too persuasive.

498
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:26,225
I hope.

499
00:24:37,745 --> 00:24:38,677
Nick,

500
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:40,644
you're family now.

501
00:24:40,748 --> 00:24:43,376
Tobacco takes care of its own, eh?

502
00:24:43,484 --> 00:24:45,418
Thank you, sir.

503
00:24:58,332 --> 00:24:59,264
Mr. Naylor?

504
00:24:59,367 --> 00:25:00,356
Hi.

505
00:25:00,468 --> 00:25:01,901
Hi. Welcome to Tobacco One.

506
00:25:02,003 --> 00:25:03,265
Thank you.

507
00:25:03,371 --> 00:25:05,999
The captain told me to take
extra special care of you today.

508
00:25:06,107 --> 00:25:08,541
So if there is anything
at all I can do

509
00:25:08,642 --> 00:25:09,904
to make your flight
more pleasant,

510
00:25:10,011 --> 00:25:13,276
you be sure and let me know now.

511
00:25:25,459 --> 00:25:26,551
BR.

512
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,558
Pleasant flight?

513
00:25:27,661 --> 00:25:29,754
Oh! You could say that.

514
00:25:29,864 --> 00:25:31,627
Came up on the Captain's plane.

515
00:25:31,732 --> 00:25:33,632
Oh, it's quite the way to travel.

516
00:25:33,734 --> 00:25:35,599
I wouldn't know.

517
00:25:35,703 --> 00:25:36,965
No? You never been on Tobacco One

518
00:25:37,071 --> 00:25:40,302
with those seats, that kitchen,

519
00:25:40,408 --> 00:25:42,069
that stewardess, Tiffany?

520
00:25:42,176 --> 00:25:44,201
Haven't had the chance yet.

521
00:25:44,311 --> 00:25:45,608
Oh, well, you really must try it.

522
00:25:45,713 --> 00:25:47,772
It's the only way to travel.

523
00:25:47,882 --> 00:25:51,113
What'd he think of your $50 million
anti-smoking campaign?

524
00:25:51,218 --> 00:25:53,152
Oh, the $50 million
anti teen-smoking campaign?

525
00:25:53,254 --> 00:25:54,152
Yeah.

526
00:25:54,255 --> 00:25:55,415
Yeah, he gave that the go-ahead.

527
00:25:55,523 --> 00:25:56,683
Oh, and he loved your idea

528
00:25:56,791 --> 00:25:58,088
to put cigarettes back into movies.

529
00:25:58,192 --> 00:26:00,752
- That was your idea.
- Oh, yeah?

530
00:26:00,861 --> 00:26:02,988
- He must have gotten confused.
- Hmm.

531
00:26:03,097 --> 00:26:07,500
Yeah. Well, either way,
he was pretty blown away.

532
00:26:07,601 --> 00:26:10,263
Right. Well, get a flight to L.A.

533
00:26:10,371 --> 00:26:11,463
I'll get you a meeting
with Jeff Megall.

534
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:12,596
Who?

535
00:26:12,706 --> 00:26:13,968
Hollywood super agent.

536
00:26:14,075 --> 00:26:17,738
Runs the agency EGO:
Entertainment Global Offices.

537
00:26:17,845 --> 00:26:19,403
This guy is the entertainment business.

538
00:26:19,513 --> 00:26:21,777
And you are cigarettes, BR.

539
00:26:21,882 --> 00:26:23,747
Whatever.

540
00:26:25,352 --> 00:26:27,479
Yeah, but it's not a vacation,
it's a learning experience.

541
00:26:27,588 --> 00:26:29,647
And California is one
of the fastest-growing

542
00:26:29,757 --> 00:26:30,951
states, it's got

543
00:26:31,058 --> 00:26:32,753
the largest number of electoral
votes in the country.

544
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,658
I mean, this could be
a very good trip for Joey.

545
00:26:35,763 --> 00:26:37,094
You know what?
Don't smooth-talk me.

546
00:26:37,198 --> 00:26:38,187
You're not going to
take him sightseeing.

547
00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:39,357
You're probably going

548
00:26:39,467 --> 00:26:41,458
to take him
to some lung cancer symposium

549
00:26:41,569 --> 00:26:43,503
where a guy with an electronic
voice box will tell him

550
00:26:43,604 --> 00:26:44,764
that his father is the devil.

551
00:26:44,872 --> 00:26:46,032
That's unfair.

552
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,437
Unfair? What about Virginia?

553
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:48,906
And what about Virginia?

554
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:50,772
You took him to a cigarette factory.

555
00:26:50,878 --> 00:26:52,743
No, I took him to a tobacco farm.

556
00:26:52,847 --> 00:26:54,041
That's hardly the same thing.

557
00:26:54,148 --> 00:26:56,139
This conversation's over.

558
00:27:00,087 --> 00:27:02,112
Oh, fuck.

559
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:04,951
Last week we had another
disgruntled postman.

560
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:06,048
Of course,

561
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,320
an hour later the Washington Post

562
00:27:07,428 --> 00:27:10,226
is calling me on the phone-
godless swine.

563
00:27:10,331 --> 00:27:11,855
I said to 'em, I says,

564
00:27:11,966 --> 00:27:15,993
"Now if a plane crashes
on account of pilot error,

565
00:27:16,103 --> 00:27:17,468
do you blame the Boeing Corporation?"

566
00:27:17,571 --> 00:27:18,560
Nice.

567
00:27:18,672 --> 00:27:20,037
- That's a good one.
- Thank you.

568
00:27:20,141 --> 00:27:22,701
If some booze-besotten drunk
runs someone down,

569
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,744
do you go banging on the doors
at General Motors?

570
00:27:24,845 --> 00:27:26,176
Tell me you didn't say that.

571
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,645
Mm-hmm.

572
00:27:27,748 --> 00:27:29,739
Have either of you heard of a
reporter named Heather Holloway?

573
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:33,013
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Irish type.

574
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,485
Brown hair, big blue eyes.

575
00:27:34,588 --> 00:27:35,680
Nice skin.

576
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:36,813
Amazing tits.

577
00:27:36,924 --> 00:27:39,688
Tits? Why are tits relevant?

578
00:27:39,793 --> 00:27:41,124
Hmm, let's see.

579
00:27:41,228 --> 00:27:43,992
World-class tits on a reporter
interviewing a man

580
00:27:44,098 --> 00:27:46,931
with privileged information
are relevant.

581
00:27:47,034 --> 00:27:49,025
How about it, Nick?
Are you a tit man?

582
00:27:49,136 --> 00:27:50,933
Don't answer that.
That's a trap.

583
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:53,836
Depends whose tits.

584
00:27:53,941 --> 00:27:55,738
Look, just don't get screwed,
all right?

585
00:27:55,843 --> 00:27:58,812
Bobby, I think I can handle
a good-looking girl reporter.

586
00:27:58,913 --> 00:28:00,540
Thank you.

587
00:28:09,757 --> 00:28:10,781
Heather Holloway.

588
00:28:10,891 --> 00:28:12,620
Nick Naylor, big tobacco.

589
00:28:14,328 --> 00:28:16,523
Is this kosher?

590
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,564
Only if I can call you "Heather."

591
00:28:18,666 --> 00:28:20,930
By all means.

592
00:28:23,537 --> 00:28:24,526
So, Mr. Naylor...

593
00:28:24,638 --> 00:28:26,731
- Nick.
- Nick.

594
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,865
Let's start with...

595
00:28:28,976 --> 00:28:30,307
An '82 Margaux.

596
00:28:30,411 --> 00:28:32,436
Okay. Is it good?

597
00:28:32,546 --> 00:28:35,982
Good? It'll make you believe in God.

598
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:52,221
So what is the focus of your piece?

599
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:54,164
- You.
- Really?

600
00:28:54,268 --> 00:28:56,099
You want to know how I live
with myself.

601
00:28:56,203 --> 00:28:59,934
No. I don't imagine
that's much of a problem.

602
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,270
I want to know how you see yourself.

603
00:29:02,376 --> 00:29:03,570
I'm...

604
00:29:03,677 --> 00:29:06,441
a mediator between two sects
of society

605
00:29:06,547 --> 00:29:08,242
that are trying
to reach an accommodation.

606
00:29:08,349 --> 00:29:10,214
Interesting.

607
00:29:10,317 --> 00:29:13,980
My other interviews have pinned
you as a mass murderer,

608
00:29:14,088 --> 00:29:17,148
bloodsucker, pimp,
profiteer, child killer,

609
00:29:17,258 --> 00:29:20,523
and my personal favorite
"yuppie Mephistopheles."

610
00:29:20,628 --> 00:29:23,756
Wow, that sounds
like a balanced article.

611
00:29:23,864 --> 00:29:25,923
Who else should I talk to?

612
00:29:26,033 --> 00:29:28,160
55 million American smokers,
for starters

613
00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:31,136
or perhaps
the American tobacco farmer

614
00:29:31,238 --> 00:29:33,365
who is constantly being treated
like a drug smuggler.

615
00:29:33,474 --> 00:29:34,873
I actually do plan on speaking
to a tobacco farmer.

616
00:29:34,975 --> 00:29:35,964
Good.

617
00:29:36,076 --> 00:29:38,135
They're fine people,
salt of the earth.

618
00:29:38,245 --> 00:29:40,645
Nick, why do you do this?

619
00:29:40,748 --> 00:29:42,409
What motivates you?

620
00:29:48,922 --> 00:29:51,015
You really want to know?

621
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:52,285
Mm-hmm.

622
00:29:52,393 --> 00:29:53,417
Really?

623
00:29:53,527 --> 00:29:55,324
Mm-hmm.

624
00:29:55,429 --> 00:30:00,059
Population control.

625
00:30:04,004 --> 00:30:05,096
You're bad.

626
00:30:07,541 --> 00:30:09,668
Everyone's got a mortgage to pay.

627
00:30:09,777 --> 00:30:12,007
The yuppie Nuremberg defense.

628
00:30:12,111 --> 00:30:15,638
So is a mortgage that much
of a life goal?

629
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:20,047
Well, 99% of everything done
in the world, good or bad,

630
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:22,677
is done to pay a mortgage,
so perhaps the world

631
00:30:22,788 --> 00:30:24,813
would be a better place
if everyone rented.

632
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:27,016
Then why don't you rent?

633
00:30:27,126 --> 00:30:28,923
Mm. Well, I rent as well.

634
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:30,494
- Really?
- Yeah.

635
00:30:30,596 --> 00:30:32,860
My son and his mother
and her boyfriend

636
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:33,932
live in my house.

637
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:35,158
I live in my apartment.

638
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:38,759
What does Nick Naylor's
apartment look like?

639
00:30:38,871 --> 00:30:41,305
I don't know.
It's nothing impressive.

640
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:42,771
It wouldn't make
the real estate section.

641
00:30:43,876 --> 00:30:45,639
Can I see it?

642
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,009
You want to see my apartment?

643
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:53,016
I'd like to see
where the devil sleeps.

644
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:01,451
I know what
you're probably thinking.

645
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:06,156
This is a bad idea, right?

646
00:31:08,901 --> 00:31:10,528
I mean, come on.

647
00:31:10,636 --> 00:31:11,728
It's not that bad of an idea.

648
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:27,943
Mom, why can't I go

649
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:30,112
to California?

650
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:33,658
Because California's
just not a... safe place.

651
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:36,284
And besides,
I'm not sure it's appropriate

652
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:39,626
for your father to bring you
on a business trip.

653
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,164
Appropriate for who?

654
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:43,234
What?

655
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:45,633
Mom, is it possible that
you're taking the frustration

656
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,602
of your failed marriage out on me?

657
00:31:48,674 --> 00:31:51,142
Excuse me?

658
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:53,507
This California trip seems like
a great learning opportunity

659
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:56,410
and a chance for me
to get to know my father.

660
00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:58,244
But if you think it's more important

661
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,215
to use me to channel your frustration

662
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:02,219
against the man you no longer love,

663
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:03,982
I'll understand.

664
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:10,961
How'd you convince her?

665
00:32:11,063 --> 00:32:13,258
It was an argument,
not a negotiation.

666
00:32:13,365 --> 00:32:14,992
That's my boy.

667
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:02,974
Nick?

668
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:05,208
Nick, Jack, Jeff's assistant. Hey.

669
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,581
How was your flight?
Are you jet-lagged at all?

670
00:33:07,686 --> 00:33:09,381
It's, like, 2:00 in D.C.
right now.

671
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:10,955
You know what?
Take some vitamin B.

672
00:33:11,056 --> 00:33:12,284
Jeff swears by it- in fact,

673
00:33:12,391 --> 00:33:14,052
I'm gonna hook you up
with an injection.

674
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,558
Who's this with you?
How are you, dude? What's going on?

675
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:16,753
You guys ever been to L.A. before?

676
00:33:16,862 --> 00:33:18,693
You want to head back
to Jeff’s office?

677
00:33:18,797 --> 00:33:21,163
In fact, we probably should-
He's a punctual being.

678
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:24,099
We actually had some problems at first
with the exterior mirrored glass.

679
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:26,762
The reflection of the sun was causing
head-on collisions on Wilshire.

680
00:33:26,872 --> 00:33:28,464
Oh, is everybody all right?

681
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:30,734
Yeah, they got three-picture deals
at Paramount- I'm sure they'll live.

682
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,070
- It's a nice building.
- Yeah?

683
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:34,042
Hey, tell Jeff you think so, okay?

684
00:33:34,146 --> 00:33:36,671
'Cause he just put a lot
of himself into this building.

685
00:33:36,782 --> 00:33:40,218
And you know something?
It really shows.

686
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:41,877
What's up, Hiroshi?

687
00:33:41,987 --> 00:33:45,753
Keep going- that sand's
not gonna rake itself.

688
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,882
All right, come here,
this is my favorite part.

689
00:33:47,993 --> 00:33:51,224
That one right there?
It's $7,000.

690
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:53,355
- $7,000 for a fish?
- Yep.

691
00:33:53,465 --> 00:33:55,365
Kind of makes you want
to stop eating sushi,

692
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:57,094
but I guess you kind of have to.

693
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:59,033
Hey, you see that
big white one right there?

694
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:01,901
Swear to you- $12,000,
gift from Oprah.

695
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:05,807
It's a Chamberlain- office-warming gift
from Matthew McConaughey.

696
00:34:05,911 --> 00:34:07,276
Generous gift.

697
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:09,404
Yeah. Right!

698
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:12,347
Don't get me wrong, Matthew is
a tremendously talented individual

699
00:34:12,451 --> 00:34:13,941
and an extremely decent human being,

700
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,577
however, before Jeff
took him on, he was a face.

701
00:34:16,688 --> 00:34:17,916
Now he's a name.

702
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,461
Do you hear that?

703
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:29,030
No.

704
00:34:30,102 --> 00:34:32,332
Exactly.

705
00:34:41,213 --> 00:34:42,578
Hey, Neal.

706
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:44,945
Neal, I'm gonna impale
your mom on a spike,

707
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:47,712
and I'm gonna feed her dead body
to my dog with syphilis.

708
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,582
Aw, Jack, you got me!

709
00:34:49,688 --> 00:34:51,349
That guy!

710
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:54,152
It's an inside joke.

711
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:56,523
So, as you can see,

712
00:34:56,628 --> 00:34:58,823
Jeff just really loves Asian shit.

713
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,659
Uh, Candace, is he ready?

714
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:02,427
- Mm-hmm.
- Fantastic.

715
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:04,798
Okay, Joey,
I'm gonna bring your dad in now.

716
00:35:04,903 --> 00:35:06,928
Is there anything I can get
you while you're waiting,

717
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:09,233
like an orange juice
or a coffee or a Red Bull?

718
00:35:09,341 --> 00:35:11,741
- No, thanks.
- Okay.

719
00:35:14,246 --> 00:35:16,214
Wow, it's a great office.

720
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:18,305
Yeah. Jeff basically designed
the whole thing.

721
00:35:18,417 --> 00:35:20,317
The architect just made the drawings.

722
00:35:20,419 --> 00:35:22,785
Jack, stop it.

723
00:35:22,888 --> 00:35:24,185
Next you're gonna be telling him

724
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:25,779
what position I played
for the Bruins.

725
00:35:25,891 --> 00:35:26,789
Quarterback.

726
00:35:26,892 --> 00:35:28,154
Jeff Megall.

727
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,488
Nick Naylor.

728
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:31,824
Mr. Naylor's here to see
if we can't get cigarettes

729
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:34,455
- into the hands of somebody
other than the usual RAVs.
- Sure.

730
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:37,057
- RAVs?
- Russians, Arabs and Villains.

731
00:35:37,169 --> 00:35:38,898
Oh, well, then yes, I guess
that is why I'm here.

732
00:35:39,004 --> 00:35:41,199
Good. I think we can help.

733
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,399
Jeff invented product placement.

734
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:45,476
I feel I have to ask, uh...

735
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:48,569
Are you concerned at
all about the, um...

736
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,238
about the health element?

737
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:53,215
I'm not a doctor, I'm a facilitator.

738
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:54,580
I bring creative people together.

739
00:35:54,686 --> 00:35:56,881
Whatever information there is,
exists, it's out there.

740
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,182
People will decide for themselves.

741
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,724
They should. It's not
my role to decide for them.

742
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:02,726
It'd be morally presumptuous.

743
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:05,388
I could learn a lot
from this man.

744
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:07,863
Now, what we need is
a smoking role model,

745
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:08,898
a real winner.

746
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,695
Indiana Jones meets Jerry Maguire.

747
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:11,860
Right, on two packs a day.

748
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,995
Only he can't live
in contemporary society.

749
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:15,003
Why not?

750
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:17,097
The health issue's way too prevalent.

751
00:36:17,209 --> 00:36:19,143
People would constantly
be asking the character

752
00:36:19,244 --> 00:36:21,508
why he's smoking-
and that should go unsaid.

753
00:36:21,613 --> 00:36:23,547
How do you feel about the future?

754
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:25,843
The future?

755
00:36:25,951 --> 00:36:27,680
Yeah, after the health thing's
blown over.

756
00:36:27,786 --> 00:36:29,117
A world
where smokers and nonsmokers

757
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:30,620
live together in perfect harmony.

758
00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:33,088
Sony has a futuristic sci-fi movie
they're looking to make.

759
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,125
Message From Sector Six.

760
00:36:35,227 --> 00:36:37,252
All takes place in a space station.

761
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:39,227
They're actively looking
for some cofinancing.

762
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:40,798
So cigarettes in space?

763
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:43,026
It's the final frontier, Nick.

764
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:45,125
But wouldn't they blow up
in an all-oxygen environment?

765
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,933
Probably.

766
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,633
But it's an easy fix-
one line of dialogue:

767
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:52,710
"Thank God we invented the..."
you know,

768
00:36:52,811 --> 00:36:54,108
whatever device.

769
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,077
Brad Pitt.

770
00:36:56,181 --> 00:36:57,739
Catherine Zeta-Jones.

771
00:36:57,849 --> 00:36:59,248
They've just finished ravishing

772
00:36:59,351 --> 00:37:01,945
each other's bodies
for the first time.

773
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,078
They lie naked, suspended in air

774
00:37:04,189 --> 00:37:05,622
underneath the heavens.

775
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:08,090
Pitt lights up.

776
00:37:08,193 --> 00:37:09,922
He starts blowing smoke rings
all around

777
00:37:10,028 --> 00:37:11,825
Catherine's naked, flawless body,

778
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:15,093
as the galaxies go whizzing
by over the glass-domed ceiling.

779
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,259
Now, tell me that
doesn't work for you.

780
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:18,666
I'd see that movie.

781
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,032
I'd buy the goddamn DVD.

782
00:37:20,138 --> 00:37:22,834
You know, if the academy
didn't send them to me for free.

783
00:37:22,941 --> 00:37:24,408
You know,

784
00:37:24,509 --> 00:37:26,670
you guys ought to think
about designing a cigarette

785
00:37:26,778 --> 00:37:28,507
to be released simultaneously
with the movie.

786
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:30,171
Sector Sixes.

787
00:37:30,282 --> 00:37:31,840
No one's ever done it
with a cigarette.

788
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,076
Wow.

789
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:35,084
Well, where do we go from here?

790
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:38,019
You enjoy the rest of your day
in L.A. with your son

791
00:37:38,123 --> 00:37:40,057
while I find out
the answers to these questions.

792
00:37:40,158 --> 00:37:42,786
Hey, where can I get
a bite to eat with my son?

793
00:37:42,894 --> 00:37:44,418
You ought to try Nobu's new place.

794
00:37:44,529 --> 00:37:46,929
- He only serves food that's white.
- Oh, great.

795
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:50,429
So, you go to an office,

796
00:37:50,535 --> 00:37:53,163
then you go on TV
and talk about cigarettes.

797
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,102
Then you fly out to L.A.

798
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:57,674
to talk to some guy who
works with movie stars.

799
00:37:57,776 --> 00:38:01,075
- What is that?
- That's my job; I'm a lobbyist.

800
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:03,841
I know, but did you study to do that?

801
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:06,440
No. No, I just kind of figured it out.

802
00:38:06,551 --> 00:38:08,644
Then can't anyone just do that?

803
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:12,689
No, it, uh, requires a...

804
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:16,522
a moral flexibility
that goes beyond most people.

805
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:20,462
Do I have flexible morals?

806
00:38:20,565 --> 00:38:23,261
Well, let's say
you became a lawyer, right?

807
00:38:23,368 --> 00:38:24,995
And you were asked
to defend a murderer.

808
00:38:25,103 --> 00:38:26,627
Worse than that- a child murderer.

809
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:28,035
Now,

810
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:31,131
the law states that every person
deserves a fair trial.

811
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:33,335
Would you defend them?

812
00:38:33,445 --> 00:38:35,140
I don't know.
I guess every person

813
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:37,077
- deserves a fair defense.
- Yeah, well,

814
00:38:37,182 --> 00:38:39,309
so do multinational corporations.

815
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:42,716
So, what happens when you're wrong?

816
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:44,482
Well, Joey, I'm never wrong.

817
00:38:44,589 --> 00:38:46,056
But you can't always be right.

818
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:49,092
Well, if it's your job to be right,
then you're never wrong.

819
00:38:49,194 --> 00:38:51,389
But what if you are wrong?

820
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:53,657
Okay, let's say that
you're defending chocolate

821
00:38:53,765 --> 00:38:55,096
and I'm defending vanilla.

822
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,600
Now, if I were to say to you,

823
00:38:57,702 --> 00:39:00,603
"Vanilla's the best flavor
ice cream," you'd say...?

824
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:02,764
- "No, chocolate is."
- Exactly.

825
00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:04,466
But you can't win that argument.

826
00:39:04,576 --> 00:39:07,136
So, I'll ask you-
So you think chocolate

827
00:39:07,245 --> 00:39:10,043
is the end-all and be-all
of ice cream, do you?

828
00:39:10,148 --> 00:39:12,207
It's the best ice cream;
I wouldn't order any other.

829
00:39:12,317 --> 00:39:14,217
Oh. So it's all chocolate
for you, is it?

830
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:15,911
Yes, chocolate is all I need.

831
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:17,318
Well, I need more than chocolate.

832
00:39:17,422 --> 00:39:19,413
And for that matter,
I need more than vanilla.

833
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,287
I believe that we need
freedom and choice

834
00:39:21,393 --> 00:39:23,884
when it comes to our ice cream,
and that, Joey Naylor,

835
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:25,519
that is the definition of liberty.

836
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,564
But that's not what
we're talking about.

837
00:39:27,666 --> 00:39:30,066
Ah, but that's what
I'm talking about.

838
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:33,103
- But... you didn't prove that vanilla's the best.
- I didn't have to.

839
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:36,037
I proved that you're wrong-
and if you're wrong, I'm right.

840
00:39:36,141 --> 00:39:37,108
But you still didn't

841
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,266
convince me.

842
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,707
'Cause I'm not after you.

843
00:39:39,811 --> 00:39:43,110
I'm after them.

844
00:39:59,197 --> 00:40:00,664
Hello?

845
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:02,665
Thought I'd give you a little update.

846
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:04,735
Jeff. You still at the office?

847
00:40:04,836 --> 00:40:07,361
Do you know what time it is
in Tokyo right now?

848
00:40:07,472 --> 00:40:09,235
- No.
- 4:00 P.M. tomorrow.

849
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,137
It's the future, Nick.

850
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:14,072
Anyway, for Pitt to smoke,

851
00:40:14,179 --> 00:40:16,409
it's $10 million;
for the pair, it's 25.

852
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:19,677
25?! Usually when I buy two
of something, I get a discount.

853
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:20,978
What's the extra five for?

854
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:22,246
Synergy.

855
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:25,117
These are not stupid people;
they got it right away.

856
00:40:25,223 --> 00:40:27,453
Pitt and Zeta-Jones lighting up
after some cosmic fucking

857
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:30,027
in the bubble suite's
gonna sell a lot of cigarettes.

858
00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:31,561
Well, for that kind of money,

859
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:33,563
my people will expect
some very serious smoking.

860
00:40:33,665 --> 00:40:35,155
Can Brad blow smoke rings?

861
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,665
I don't have that information.

862
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:38,463
Well, for $25 million,
we'd want smoke rings.

863
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:40,060
Oh, one other thing-
you'll be cofinancing

864
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:42,105
the picture
with the Sultan of Glutan.

865
00:40:42,207 --> 00:40:43,401
The Sultan of Glutan?

866
00:40:43,508 --> 00:40:45,533
The one who massacred
and enslaved his own people?

867
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:48,134
Aren't they calling him
the Hitler of the South Pacific?

868
00:40:48,246 --> 00:40:50,680
No, I can't speak to that-
All my dealings with him,

869
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:52,511
he's been a very reasonable
and sensitive guy.

870
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:53,845
He's fun. You'll like him.

871
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,146
I better run it by my people.

872
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:56,345
No problem.

873
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:57,819
Oh, that's London calling.

874
00:40:57,922 --> 00:41:00,049
7:00 A.M. in the Old Empire.

875
00:41:00,158 --> 00:41:01,716
Jeff, when do you sleep?

876
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:03,054
Sunday.

877
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,681
- Operator.
- Yeah, my light is blinking.

878
00:42:07,792 --> 00:42:11,023
- There's a package downstairs for you.
- Okay, send it up.

879
00:42:13,565 --> 00:42:16,762
Captain, I'm sitting in front
of an open briefcase.

880
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:18,893
I don't suppose this is a raise.

881
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:22,803
Now, Nick, do you know
who Lorne Lutch is?

882
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:24,602
Yeah, of course.
He's the original Marlboro Man.

883
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:27,177
He's dying.
He was on Sally last week.

884
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:29,473
Not exactly our biggest fan.

885
00:42:29,581 --> 00:42:30,809
Well, the money's for him.

886
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:33,543
Now, he has a ranch
out there in California.

887
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:35,312
I want you to bring it to him.

888
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:39,254
He's a cowboy, sir,
and cowboys don't like bribes.

889
00:42:39,357 --> 00:42:41,518
It's not a bribe. No, sir.

890
00:42:41,626 --> 00:42:44,390
You're going out there
on wings of angels, son.

891
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:47,430
You mean we're just going
to give him the money?

892
00:42:47,532 --> 00:42:48,931
Well, I think Christ himself
would say,

893
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:51,263
"That's mighty white of you boys."

894
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:53,428
No gag agreement?

895
00:42:53,538 --> 00:42:55,938
Hopefully, he'll be so damn
overcome with gratitude

896
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,372
he'll... he'll have to shut up.

897
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,452
Hey, kiddo, I got to go do
a little bit more work

898
00:43:11,556 --> 00:43:12,648
this afternoon, all right?

899
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:13,655
Can I come?

900
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:15,191
No. Not this time.

901
00:43:15,293 --> 00:43:17,454
But I want to see what you do.

902
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:00,362
You stay here, okay?

903
00:44:19,524 --> 00:44:22,084
What the fuck are you doing here?

904
00:44:22,193 --> 00:44:24,787
Uh... uh...

905
00:44:24,896 --> 00:44:26,591
Do you have a minute?

906
00:44:31,736 --> 00:44:33,397
What do you want?

907
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:34,732
Dad!

908
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:35,965
Joey, get back in the car.

909
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,571
Just want to talk.

910
00:44:45,917 --> 00:44:47,976
All right.

911
00:44:48,086 --> 00:44:49,553
Let's talk.

912
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:08,404
Pearl, we got company.

913
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:14,239
Mister, you got a lot of nerve
walking in here after...

914
00:45:14,345 --> 00:45:17,712
Honey, why don't you show
this young man some iced tea?

915
00:45:20,852 --> 00:45:22,342
I'll be right back, tiger.

916
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:41,330
Saw you on...

917
00:45:41,439 --> 00:45:44,931
Weren't you on that TV show?

918
00:45:45,043 --> 00:45:47,841
Yeah. Yeah, that was me.

919
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:51,506
You're lucky you made it
out of there alive.

920
00:45:51,616 --> 00:45:53,914
Yeah. Tobacco used to be
all over the television.

921
00:45:54,018 --> 00:45:58,011
Now TV is leading the witch hunt.

922
00:45:58,122 --> 00:45:59,987
Strange business.

923
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:02,992
Last year, after I was diagnosed,

924
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:08,623
flew east to attend the
annual stockholders' convention.

925
00:46:10,401 --> 00:46:12,369
Stood up and told them
I thought

926
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:17,100
they ought to cut back
on their advertising.

927
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:19,802
You know what your boss said to me?

928
00:46:23,047 --> 00:46:26,107
He said, "We're certainly sorry

929
00:46:26,217 --> 00:46:29,983
"to hear about your medical problem.

930
00:46:30,088 --> 00:46:33,524
"However, without
knowing more

931
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:37,287
"of your medical history,

932
00:46:37,395 --> 00:46:39,488
we can't comment further."

933
00:46:42,066 --> 00:46:44,296
But then they tried to pretend

934
00:46:44,402 --> 00:46:46,131
I never worked for 'em.

935
00:46:48,072 --> 00:46:50,302
Yeah, I got the pay stubs.

936
00:46:50,408 --> 00:46:53,172
But, hell,
I was on the damn billboards.

937
00:46:54,912 --> 00:46:56,641
I never
even smoked

938
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:58,772
Marlboro.

939
00:46:58,883 --> 00:47:01,351
I smoked Kools.

940
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:08,884
You look like a nice-enough fella.

941
00:47:08,993 --> 00:47:11,291
What are you doing
working for these assholes?

942
00:47:13,197 --> 00:47:15,256
I'm good at it.

943
00:47:15,366 --> 00:47:16,594
Better at doing this

944
00:47:16,701 --> 00:47:18,362
than I ever was
at doing anything else.

945
00:47:18,469 --> 00:47:20,403
Aw, hell, son.

946
00:47:20,505 --> 00:47:23,065
I was good at shooting VC.

947
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:25,142
I didn't make it my career.

948
00:47:27,445 --> 00:47:31,108
I suppose we all
got to pay the mortgage.

949
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:37,113
Your dad always bring
you along like this?

950
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:39,951
No. I live with my mom.

951
00:47:40,057 --> 00:47:41,786
He tell you why he's here today?

952
00:47:41,893 --> 00:47:45,727
He said that your husband
was the Marlboro Man.

953
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:51,131
Yeah, well, not anymore.

954
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:52,702
Hello.

955
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:54,964
Yeah. Hey, can you hold on a second?

956
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:59,168
You need anything else,
grab it out of the fridge.

957
00:47:59,277 --> 00:48:00,938
So I'm standing here
minding my own business,

958
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:02,910
filling up pill bottles...

959
00:48:03,014 --> 00:48:08,919
So you're here to talk me
into shutting up?

960
00:48:10,788 --> 00:48:13,052
That what's in that case of yours?

961
00:48:13,157 --> 00:48:15,819
Yeah, basically.

962
00:48:17,028 --> 00:48:18,427
No, not basically.

963
00:48:18,529 --> 00:48:20,759
That's... that's exactly it.

964
00:48:22,867 --> 00:48:24,494
My dignity ain't for sale.

965
00:48:24,602 --> 00:48:27,070
It's not an offer.
It's a gift.

966
00:48:27,171 --> 00:48:28,297
Taxes have all been paid.

967
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:31,136
You get to keep it
no matter what you do.

968
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:32,675
The idea is that, somehow,

969
00:48:32,777 --> 00:48:35,405
your guilt will prevent you
from bad-mouthing us.

970
00:48:35,513 --> 00:48:37,310
Are you supposed to be

971
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:39,110
telling me all that?

972
00:48:39,217 --> 00:48:41,742
No, sir. Just apologize,

973
00:48:41,852 --> 00:48:43,615
give you the money, and leave.

974
00:48:43,721 --> 00:48:45,484
Why are you telling me this?

975
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:49,993
Because, this way,
you'll take the money.

976
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:51,356
Why would I do that?

977
00:48:51,462 --> 00:48:52,451
Because you're mad.

978
00:48:52,563 --> 00:48:53,996
Damn straight I am.

979
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:55,087
The first thing you'll do,

980
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:57,292
is you'll call the L.A. Times,
and CNN...

981
00:48:57,401 --> 00:48:58,800
- Huh?
- and insist on Bonnie Carlton.

982
00:48:58,903 --> 00:48:59,801
She does really good

983
00:48:59,904 --> 00:49:00,802
controlled outrage.

984
00:49:00,905 --> 00:49:02,133
Tell them, "No Bonnie, no story."

985
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,264
Watch it on MSNBC.

986
00:49:03,374 --> 00:49:04,671
- Okay.
- When they get here,

987
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:07,710
you open up the case...

988
00:49:10,414 --> 00:49:13,577
and you pour all the cash
out onto the floor.

989
00:49:13,684 --> 00:49:14,742
- Why?
- Trust me.

990
00:49:14,852 --> 00:49:16,046
It'll look more effective that way.

991
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:20,214
Don't forget to shake
every last bundle out.

992
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:23,620
If you can, you know,
give a cough or two.

993
00:49:23,728 --> 00:49:26,629
Once it's all
out on the floor,

994
00:49:26,731 --> 00:49:28,198
tell them what you're
going to do with it.

995
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:29,266
What am I going to do with it?

996
00:49:29,367 --> 00:49:30,391
You're going to donate it.

997
00:49:30,501 --> 00:49:32,696
Yeah. Start the Lorne Lutch
Cancer Foundation.

998
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,134
You're going to have
a ranch and a fair

999
00:49:34,238 --> 00:49:36,866
and a 5K.
A 5K is a must. Television...

1000
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:37,998
Wait a minute.

1001
00:49:38,109 --> 00:49:40,339
What about my family?

1002
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,975
But, Lorne, you can't keep the money.

1003
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:46,572
Why the hell not?

1004
00:49:46,684 --> 00:49:47,912
What do you mean?

1005
00:49:48,019 --> 00:49:50,613
Denounce us,
and then keep the blood money?

1006
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:52,018
I mean, look at it.

1007
00:49:59,297 --> 00:50:00,195
I got to think this over.

1008
00:50:00,298 --> 00:50:01,162
Lorne, whoa.

1009
00:50:01,265 --> 00:50:03,256
News doesn't work that way.

1010
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:05,392
You can't denounce us next week.

1011
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:15,274
I don't suppose I can
denounce you for half of it.

1012
00:50:15,379 --> 00:50:18,746
No, Lorne. Either you keep
all the money,

1013
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:21,613
or you... you give it all away.

1014
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:34,224
Dad, how did you know

1015
00:50:34,332 --> 00:50:36,197
he would take the money?

1016
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:41,437
You'd have to be crazy
to turn down all that money.

1017
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:44,007
When I saw he wasn't crazy,
I knew he'd take it.

1018
00:50:45,509 --> 00:50:47,977
Would you have taken it?

1019
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:50,639
If I were him? Sure.

1020
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:54,851
So would I.

1021
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:07,455
I don't think you understand, sir.

1022
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:08,862
He's like a wild animal.

1023
00:51:08,966 --> 00:51:10,627
You'll have to be
on your guard at all times.

1024
00:51:10,735 --> 00:51:11,724
He has this trick.

1025
00:51:11,836 --> 00:51:13,030
Ron, shut up.

1026
00:51:13,137 --> 00:51:14,968
I've tangoed with presidents,
lawyers and Indian chiefs.

1027
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:17,632
I think I can handle Mr. Nick Naylor.

1028
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:20,804
All right, welcome back, kids.

1029
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,811
We've got two guests
on the show tonight.

1030
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,904
First, joining us
from our Washington studio...

1031
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:26,949
I must have that tie clip!

1032
00:51:27,051 --> 00:51:29,645
...is the senator from
the great state of Vermont.

1033
00:51:29,754 --> 00:51:31,915
Please welcome Ortolan Finistirre.

1034
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:32,920
Welcome, Senator.

1035
00:51:33,023 --> 00:51:34,581
Good to be here, Dennis.

1036
00:51:34,692 --> 00:51:36,387
And, joining us here
in our Los Angeles studio,

1037
00:51:36,494 --> 00:51:38,359
he is the chief spokesperson

1038
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:40,657
for the Academy of Tobacco Studies.

1039
00:51:40,765 --> 00:51:42,255
Quite an august chamber, might I add?

1040
00:51:42,366 --> 00:51:44,129
- Nick Naylor. Nick, welcome.
- Pleasure to be here.

1041
00:51:44,235 --> 00:51:46,965
All right, I understand you were
on Joan Lunden's show recently.

1042
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:48,663
Didn't make a lot
of friends over there, did you?

1043
00:51:48,773 --> 00:51:50,138
I will say that I don't think

1044
00:51:50,241 --> 00:51:51,538
I'll be getting
my annual invitation

1045
00:51:51,642 --> 00:51:54,406
to the Finistirre Labor Day Barbecue.

1046
00:51:54,512 --> 00:51:56,912
Well, I continue to offer
an open invitation to Mr. Naylor

1047
00:51:57,014 --> 00:51:59,346
to join us in Congress
to talk about the inclusion

1048
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:02,180
of our new poison label which,
if I might say...

1049
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:04,447
Nick, ready to trek up
the Hill and testify

1050
00:52:04,555 --> 00:52:05,749
before Congress?

1051
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:08,017
Well, I'd love to, Dennis,
but not as long as the senator

1052
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,490
is calling for me to be fired.

1053
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:11,891
It's not exactly
a welcome invitation.

1054
00:52:11,996 --> 00:52:14,521
Yeah. Bit of a mixed message,
Senator.

1055
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:16,896
Well, not as mixed as the stance
that Big Tobacco has taken

1056
00:52:17,001 --> 00:52:18,764
about the dangers
of smoking cigarettes.

1057
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:20,302
- Oh, no.
- Now what are you laughing...?

1058
00:52:20,404 --> 00:52:22,497
You're a wind-up artist.
Give the man his due.

1059
00:52:22,606 --> 00:52:24,403
He's got a bit of a point there,
doesn't he?

1060
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:26,373
Sorry. I just can't
help myself, Dennis.

1061
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:28,138
I... I... I'm just tickled by the idea

1062
00:52:28,245 --> 00:52:29,940
of the gentleman from Vermont

1063
00:52:30,047 --> 00:52:32,607
calling me a hypocrite
when, uh... this same man,

1064
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:34,581
in one day, held a press
conference where he called

1065
00:52:34,685 --> 00:52:37,176
for the American tobacco fields
to be slashed and burned,

1066
00:52:37,288 --> 00:52:38,880
then he jumped on a private jet

1067
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:41,480
and flew down to Farm Aid
where he rode a tractor onstage

1068
00:52:41,592 --> 00:52:44,584
- Oh, come on.
- as he bemoaned the downfall
of the American farmer.

1069
00:52:44,695 --> 00:52:46,492
Care to comment, Senator?

1070
00:52:46,597 --> 00:52:48,531
He... I... No.

1071
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:50,862
Eloquent in its brevity.

1072
00:52:50,968 --> 00:52:52,094
Emotional issue.

1073
00:52:52,203 --> 00:52:53,431
Let's take some phone calls now.

1074
00:52:53,537 --> 00:52:55,835
Herndon, Virginia.
Go ahead. You're on the show.

1075
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:58,431
Dennis, has anyone ever
announced that they're going

1076
00:52:58,542 --> 00:53:00,305
to kill someone live on your show?

1077
00:53:00,411 --> 00:53:03,642
My demo's been called quirky
but, no, at this point,

1078
00:53:03,747 --> 00:53:05,840
we're not skewing
to the emotionally unstable.

1079
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:08,077
Then it's your lucky day.

1080
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:09,846
Because I'm here to tell
you that, within a week,

1081
00:53:09,954 --> 00:53:12,548
we're going to dispatch
Mr. Naylor from this planet

1082
00:53:12,656 --> 00:53:16,353
for all the pain and suffering
he's caused in the world.

1083
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:22,621
As I said, emotional issue.
We're going to break now.

1084
00:53:22,733 --> 00:53:24,496
I got to fire a call screener.

1085
00:53:51,428 --> 00:53:52,895
Let's go.

1086
00:54:28,566 --> 00:54:31,228
This is Nick Naylor
telling you kids,

1087
00:54:31,335 --> 00:54:34,532
"Don't do drugs, smoke cigarettes."

1088
00:54:34,638 --> 00:54:35,798
That's really great.

1089
00:54:35,906 --> 00:54:37,533
It's like I'm looking in a mirror.

1090
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:39,768
New idea:

1091
00:54:39,877 --> 00:54:42,243
cigarettes for the homeless.

1092
00:54:42,346 --> 00:54:43,438
We'll call them "hobos."

1093
00:54:44,982 --> 00:54:46,347
Uh, that's awful.

1094
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:47,974
Any better than "Sector Sixes"?

1095
00:54:48,085 --> 00:54:50,053
Right.

1096
00:54:50,154 --> 00:54:52,987
Oh, my God, Nick, you're on TV.

1097
00:54:54,158 --> 00:54:56,786
"Lobbyist on the lookout."

1098
00:54:56,894 --> 00:55:00,091
You got to be kidding me.

1099
00:55:01,365 --> 00:55:05,062
I want to fuck you
while I watch you on TV.

1100
00:55:05,169 --> 00:55:06,898
And they call me sick.

1101
00:55:07,004 --> 00:55:07,902
Hurry.

1102
00:55:08,005 --> 00:55:09,996
Before your segment ends.

1103
00:55:10,107 --> 00:55:12,041
All right.

1104
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:19,942
Tell me more about Los Angeles, baby.

1105
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:21,210
Huh?

1106
00:55:25,422 --> 00:55:27,219
He says he wants
to trail me everywhere,

1107
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:28,484
I said, "Who's paying for it?"

1108
00:55:28,592 --> 00:55:30,082
He says the tobacco company's
paying for it.

1109
00:55:30,194 --> 00:55:31,718
I said, "I don't need a bodyguard."

1110
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:33,387
I'm a man of the people.

1111
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:35,362
Rock on, Kennedy.

1112
00:55:35,466 --> 00:55:37,161
Listen, we're all going to
need bodyguards soon enough.

1113
00:55:37,267 --> 00:55:39,064
Did you see the coverage
the fetal alcohol people

1114
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,227
got themselves over this weekend?

1115
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:42,168
They made it seem like
we were encouraging

1116
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:43,398
pregnant women to drink.

1117
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:44,599
I'm surprised I didn't get kidnapped

1118
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:46,039
on my way to work this morning.

1119
00:55:46,143 --> 00:55:49,635
I don't think people from
the alcoholic beverage industry

1120
00:55:49,747 --> 00:55:51,738
need to worry about
being kidnapped just yet.

1121
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:54,942
Pardon me?

1122
00:55:55,052 --> 00:55:56,349
Look, I mean,

1123
00:55:56,453 --> 00:55:58,444
nothing personal,
but tobacco generates

1124
00:55:58,555 --> 00:56:00,785
a little more heat than alcohol.

1125
00:56:00,891 --> 00:56:02,358
Oh, this is news.

1126
00:56:02,459 --> 00:56:06,088
My product puts away 475,000 a year.

1127
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,858
Oh, okay, now 475 is a legit number.

1128
00:56:08,966 --> 00:56:10,194
Okay, 435,000.

1129
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:11,358
That's 1,200 a day.

1130
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:12,799
How many alcohol-related deaths
a year?

1131
00:56:12,903 --> 00:56:15,030
- Well, does that...
- 100,000 tops?

1132
00:56:15,139 --> 00:56:18,768
That's, what, 270 a day?

1133
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:20,036
Wowee.

1134
00:56:20,144 --> 00:56:22,510
270 people, a tragedy.

1135
00:56:22,613 --> 00:56:24,604
Excuse me if I don't exactly see
terrorists getting excited

1136
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:26,342
about kidnapping anyone
from the alcohol industry.

1137
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:27,712
- Well, you haven't even
- Okay,

1138
00:56:27,818 --> 00:56:29,649
- taken into account the number of deaths
- let's just

1139
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:32,449
- breathe.
- How many gun deaths a year in the U. S?

1140
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:34,285
11,000.

1141
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:36,723
11,000, are you kidding me?

1142
00:56:36,827 --> 00:56:38,761
30 a day.

1143
00:56:38,862 --> 00:56:40,295
That's less than passenger car
mortalities.

1144
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:41,989
No terrorist would bother
with either of you.

1145
00:56:55,679 --> 00:56:57,442
Okay, look...
stupid argument.

1146
00:56:57,548 --> 00:56:59,573
I'll say.

1147
00:56:59,683 --> 00:57:02,652
I'm sure both of you warrant
vigilante justice.

1148
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:04,516
Thank you.

1149
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:26,637
Hey... please.
Stop... hey.

1150
00:57:26,744 --> 00:57:27,836
Who are you guys?

1151
00:57:31,749 --> 00:57:34,047
And freedom means
that we can do what we want.

1152
00:57:34,151 --> 00:57:36,517
And that's really important.

1153
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:40,215
Because otherwise,
we couldn't be free.

1154
00:57:40,324 --> 00:57:44,351
And that's why America is
the best government in the world.

1155
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,019
Whoa, hey, hey, hey.

1156
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:48,826
Hey, no need for that,
no need for that.

1157
00:57:48,932 --> 00:57:50,297
Whoa, whoa, hey.

1158
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,367
Hey, wait.

1159
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:52,662
Can we get a dialogue going here?

1160
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:55,534
Nick, we want you
to stop killing people.

1161
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:57,368
So many people.

1162
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,032
Half a million people a year
in the U.S.

1163
00:57:59,143 --> 00:58:00,838
That, there's no data
to support that.

1164
00:58:00,944 --> 00:58:03,071
Nick... you're not on TV anymore.

1165
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,178
Okay, Joey, it's your turn.

1166
00:58:10,788 --> 00:58:12,050
Hey!

1167
00:58:12,156 --> 00:58:13,555
Nick, how much do you smoke a day?

1168
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:15,215
Hey, what are you doing?

1169
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:17,589
According to the box,
each one of those patches

1170
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:19,855
contains 21 milligrams of nicotine.

1171
00:58:19,963 --> 00:58:20,930
That's, like, what?

1172
00:58:21,031 --> 00:58:22,430
One pack?

1173
00:58:22,533 --> 00:58:24,831
Our industry has been working
hand in hand with...

1174
00:58:24,935 --> 00:58:26,869
Nick! Just listen, all right?

1175
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:28,528
What makes America
the best government?

1176
00:58:28,639 --> 00:58:30,937
The passion that doesn't exist
anywhere in the world.

1177
00:58:31,041 --> 00:58:32,941
Says here there are
many adverse reactions

1178
00:58:33,043 --> 00:58:34,101
from those things.

1179
00:58:34,211 --> 00:58:36,111
Let's see, "arrhythmia,

1180
00:58:36,213 --> 00:58:37,680
"constipation, dyspepsia,

1181
00:58:37,781 --> 00:58:40,306
- "nausea...
- My industry does $48 billion in revenue.

1182
00:58:40,417 --> 00:58:42,112
pharyngitis, sinusitis..."

1183
00:58:42,219 --> 00:58:45,052
Sure you can call it capitalism,
a free market,

1184
00:58:45,155 --> 00:58:46,782
a celebration of tariff breakdowns...

1185
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:49,552
"dysmenorrhea..."

1186
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:51,628
I don't even want to know
what that means.

1187
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:53,491
Hey, look, I guess you could
start by, you know,

1188
00:58:53,597 --> 00:58:55,394
asking for five million,
working your way up from there.

1189
00:58:55,499 --> 00:58:56,932
But I don't want any money, Nick.

1190
00:58:57,034 --> 00:58:57,966
Well, what do you want?

1191
00:58:58,068 --> 00:58:59,365
I mean, I'm all ears here.

1192
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:02,597
I have another word for it-

1193
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:03,934
love.

1194
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:05,668
What does any man want?

1195
00:59:05,776 --> 00:59:07,334
The love of a woman,

1196
00:59:07,444 --> 00:59:08,638
crisp bacon...

1197
00:59:08,745 --> 00:59:13,614
an average life span over 80 years.

1198
00:59:13,717 --> 00:59:16,083
Oh, Nick...

1199
00:59:18,255 --> 00:59:20,314
...you don't look so good.

1200
00:59:27,331 --> 00:59:29,094
If you should smell smoke,

1201
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:31,667
please dial zero for the operator.

1202
00:59:31,768 --> 00:59:35,898
Before leaving the room,
check the door for heat.

1203
00:59:36,006 --> 00:59:38,668
Find your nearest
emergency exit,

1204
00:59:38,775 --> 00:59:42,836
then soak a washcloth
and cover your nose and mouth.

1205
00:59:44,214 --> 00:59:46,409
Do not remove your washcloth.

1206
00:59:46,516 --> 00:59:50,282
Try at all times to avoid
breathing in the smoke.

1207
00:59:50,387 --> 00:59:53,652
If necessary, crawl on
your hands and knees

1208
00:59:53,757 --> 00:59:56,055
to avoid the inhalation of smoke.

1209
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:57,854
Do not be alarmed.

1210
00:59:57,961 --> 01:00:00,259
There are still
no conclusive studies

1211
01:00:00,364 --> 01:00:03,094
that link smoking to emphysema.

1212
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,665
You woke up.

1213
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:13,936
Perhaps a bad choice of inflection.

1214
01:00:14,044 --> 01:00:17,707
Is she implying that I
could’ve just as easily not?

1215
01:00:28,926 --> 01:00:30,120
I was so scared.

1216
01:00:30,227 --> 01:00:31,489
Hey, Joey.

1217
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:34,358
What happened?

1218
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:37,194
No nonsmoker
could've ever withstood

1219
01:00:37,301 --> 01:00:39,292
the amount of nicotine
you had in your bloodstream.

1220
01:00:39,403 --> 01:00:41,371
Hate to say it, but...

1221
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:44,031
cigarettes saved your life.

1222
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:47,834
Can I quote you on that, doc?

1223
01:00:47,945 --> 01:00:50,209
You're a real trooper, my boy.

1224
01:00:50,314 --> 01:00:52,145
Hey, Captain,

1225
01:00:52,249 --> 01:00:53,580
where are you?

1226
01:00:53,684 --> 01:00:55,413
Winston-Salem General.

1227
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:59,354
Damn heart failing me again.

1228
01:00:59,456 --> 01:01:01,185
I thought we could be roommates.

1229
01:01:01,291 --> 01:01:02,519
Nick, before
we get sidetracked,

1230
01:01:02,626 --> 01:01:04,321
there is one thing.

1231
01:01:04,428 --> 01:01:06,919
All right, don't get
all dramatic on me, doc.

1232
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:09,055
You can't smoke.

1233
01:01:12,836 --> 01:01:13,894
That's no problem.

1234
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:15,528
I've quit before.

1235
01:01:15,639 --> 01:01:17,539
I did during the pregnancy.

1236
01:01:17,641 --> 01:01:18,699
How long, you think?

1237
01:01:18,809 --> 01:01:20,868
I don't think you understand.

1238
01:01:20,978 --> 01:01:23,538
It's a miracle you came
out of this alive.

1239
01:01:23,647 --> 01:01:25,239
Any smoking- one cigarette-

1240
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:27,442
could put you right back
into a paralytic state.

1241
01:01:27,551 --> 01:01:30,145
Your body just can't handle it.

1242
01:01:35,459 --> 01:01:37,450
Nick, I don't want to put
any more pressure on you,

1243
01:01:37,561 --> 01:01:39,392
but we got a camera crew
waiting out there.

1244
01:01:39,496 --> 01:01:41,521
If we want to make
the evening news...

1245
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:44,191
You want to unhook me here?

1246
01:01:44,301 --> 01:01:48,203
This just goes to prove what
I've been saying for so long.

1247
01:01:48,305 --> 01:01:52,435
These nicotine patches
are just deadly.

1248
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:54,305
Smoking saved my life.

1249
01:01:54,411 --> 01:01:57,005
Considering your condition,
will you still be able to appear

1250
01:01:57,114 --> 01:01:59,173
before Senator Finistirre's
subcommittee hearing

1251
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:01,307
on the usage of poison labels
on cigarette packaging?

1252
01:02:01,418 --> 01:02:03,010
Oh, I think now more than ever

1253
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:04,951
it is imperative that I be there.

1254
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:07,080
Nothing will keep me from testifying.

1255
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:10,250
Fucking kidnapping.

1256
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:11,759
I don't understand, sir.

1257
01:02:11,862 --> 01:02:15,127
Aren't we considering
the kidnapping a good thing?

1258
01:02:15,232 --> 01:02:16,893
Well, he didn't die.

1259
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,332
He was almost killed, sir.

1260
01:02:19,436 --> 01:02:20,596
That's the point.

1261
01:02:20,704 --> 01:02:22,797
Now he looks like a victim,
lucky bastard.

1262
01:02:24,708 --> 01:02:26,835
The way I heard it,
D.C. police found you naked

1263
01:02:26,943 --> 01:02:28,604
laying in Lincoln's crotch

1264
01:02:28,712 --> 01:02:32,409
covered in nicotine patches
with a sign across your chest

1265
01:02:32,516 --> 01:02:35,007
- that said...
- He doesn't need to hear the details.

1266
01:02:35,118 --> 01:02:37,450
It was some pretty fucked up shit.

1267
01:02:37,554 --> 01:02:38,521
Shh!

1268
01:02:38,622 --> 01:02:39,611
How are you feeling?

1269
01:02:39,723 --> 01:02:43,056
I don't know.

1270
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:45,685
First time I'm thinking these
cigarettes are pretty dangerous.

1271
01:02:45,796 --> 01:02:47,764
You might be right about that.

1272
01:02:47,864 --> 01:02:49,297
What are you doing?

1273
01:02:51,068 --> 01:02:53,002
It may be small,
but it'll do the trick.

1274
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:54,229
One shot, bam.

1275
01:02:54,337 --> 01:02:56,601
Listen, Nick is not
going to shoot anyone.

1276
01:02:56,706 --> 01:02:57,832
Cool.

1277
01:02:57,941 --> 01:02:58,873
Yeah, huh?

1278
01:02:58,975 --> 01:03:00,203
I mean, uh...

1279
01:03:00,310 --> 01:03:02,141
guns are to be treated with
respect, you understand that?

1280
01:03:02,245 --> 01:03:04,213
You'll make a great father.

1281
01:03:04,314 --> 01:03:05,679
Thanks.

1282
01:03:09,653 --> 01:03:11,143
Hey, there he is!

1283
01:03:11,254 --> 01:03:12,949
Hey, he's back!

1284
01:03:13,056 --> 01:03:14,489
Hey!

1285
01:03:14,591 --> 01:03:16,024
Welcome back.

1286
01:03:16,126 --> 01:03:18,219
- You okay?
- Great.

1287
01:03:18,328 --> 01:03:20,057
Good, 'cause you're booked on
all the Sunday talk shows.

1288
01:03:20,163 --> 01:03:22,961
For once we got public sympathy
on our side.

1289
01:03:23,066 --> 01:03:25,728
We can start our own little
celebrity victim tour.

1290
01:03:25,836 --> 01:03:28,202
I mean, we couldn't have planned
this thing better ourselves.

1291
01:03:28,305 --> 01:03:30,136
Oh, maybe next time
I can lose a lung.

1292
01:03:31,775 --> 01:03:34,243
Oh. Uh, I heard the, uh...

1293
01:03:34,344 --> 01:03:36,539
Heather Holloway article
is coming out tomorrow.

1294
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:38,580
Really?

1295
01:03:38,682 --> 01:03:39,808
Yeah, anything I should be
worried about?

1296
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:42,384
Uh, yeah, the Cancer Association.

1297
01:03:42,486 --> 01:03:43,851
Apparently, they have it in for us.

1298
01:03:43,954 --> 01:03:46,184
Fuckers.

1299
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:57,567
What?

1300
01:03:57,667 --> 01:04:00,329
I got a call from the paper.

1301
01:04:00,437 --> 01:04:02,598
Really?
What'd they want?

1302
01:04:02,706 --> 01:04:05,766
They wanted the correct spelling
of my name and job title.

1303
01:04:05,876 --> 01:04:07,707
You didn't tell her
about us, did you?

1304
01:04:07,811 --> 01:04:09,472
Who?

1305
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:10,773
Heather?

1306
01:04:10,881 --> 01:04:12,746
No.

1307
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:16,713
I mean, maybe in passing, I...

1308
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:18,447
In passing.

1309
01:04:18,555 --> 01:04:19,783
Oh, God, he fucked her.

1310
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:21,255
I tried to warn you.

1311
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:23,792
Hey, he didn't fuck her.
You didn't fuck her, did you?

1312
01:04:26,229 --> 01:04:27,696
When?

1313
01:04:27,797 --> 01:04:28,729
In passing.

1314
01:04:28,832 --> 01:04:29,958
Look, she's a really nice girl.

1315
01:04:30,066 --> 01:04:31,090
Oh, God.

1316
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:33,192
We're really fucked.

1317
01:04:51,555 --> 01:04:54,319
"Nick Naylor,
lead spokesman for big tobacco,

1318
01:04:54,424 --> 01:04:57,450
"would have you believe he
thinks cigarettes are harmless.

1319
01:04:57,561 --> 01:05:00,997
"But really, he's doing it
for the mortgage.

1320
01:05:01,097 --> 01:05:05,124
The MOD squad-meaning,
of course, merchants of death-

1321
01:05:05,235 --> 01:05:08,500
is comprised of Polly Bailey
of the Moderation Council

1322
01:05:08,605 --> 01:05:10,004
and BobbyJay Bliss

1323
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:14,042
of the gun business's
own advisory group, SAFETY.

1324
01:05:14,144 --> 01:05:17,671
As explained by Naylor,
the sole purpose of their meetings

1325
01:05:17,781 --> 01:05:19,681
is to compete for
the highest death toll

1326
01:05:19,783 --> 01:05:21,341
as they compare strategies

1327
01:05:21,451 --> 01:05:24,477
on how to dupe the American people.

1328
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:27,182
The film, Message from Sector Six,

1329
01:05:27,290 --> 01:05:29,485
would emphasize the sex appeal
of cigarettes

1330
01:05:29,593 --> 01:05:31,584
in a way that only floating, nude,

1331
01:05:31,695 --> 01:05:35,358
copulating Hollywood stars could.

1332
01:05:35,465 --> 01:05:38,696
This did not stop Nick
from bribing the dying man

1333
01:05:38,802 --> 01:05:41,771
with a suitcase of cash
to keep quiet on the subject

1334
01:05:41,871 --> 01:05:46,001
of his recent lung cancer diagnosis.

1335
01:05:46,109 --> 01:05:49,636
Nick's own son, Joey Naylor,
seems to be being groomed

1336
01:05:49,746 --> 01:05:51,737
for the job as he joins his father

1337
01:05:51,848 --> 01:05:54,783
on the majority of his trips.

1338
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:03,551
I have Heather Holloway on line one.

1339
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:04,786
Heather.

1340
01:06:04,894 --> 01:06:06,691
Hey, Nick, what did you think?

1341
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,457
Heather, uh... I...

1342
01:06:08,565 --> 01:06:11,056
I mean, there's a lot
of information in here, Heather,

1343
01:06:11,167 --> 01:06:12,657
that is off the record.

1344
01:06:12,769 --> 01:06:15,033
You never said anything
about off the record.

1345
01:06:15,138 --> 01:06:19,575
I presumed anything said while
I was inside you was privileged.

1346
01:06:19,676 --> 01:06:21,143
Nick...

1347
01:06:21,244 --> 01:06:23,371
If you wanted to talk on a plane

1348
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:26,847
or at a movie or over dinner,
that would have been fine.

1349
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:28,975
But you wanted to fuck.

1350
01:06:29,085 --> 01:06:30,518
That's fine by me.

1351
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:32,645
You used me.

1352
01:06:32,756 --> 01:06:34,383
Oh, Nick, come on.

1353
01:06:34,491 --> 01:06:36,516
Now we're being children.

1354
01:06:36,626 --> 01:06:38,685
Look, we both love our jobs.

1355
01:06:38,795 --> 01:06:41,355
I'm just a reporter,
and you're just a lobbyist.

1356
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:43,694
How can you do this to me?

1357
01:06:45,969 --> 01:06:47,994
For the mortgage.

1358
01:06:56,413 --> 01:06:57,380
Bitch.

1359
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:58,538
Whore.

1360
01:06:58,648 --> 01:07:01,879
You should have been
more careful, Nick.

1361
01:07:01,985 --> 01:07:04,783
You've destroyed all the good
will created by your kidnapping.

1362
01:07:04,888 --> 01:07:06,185
Well, we'll work up a rebuttal.

1363
01:07:06,289 --> 01:07:09,019
Heather Holloway isn't
the only reporter in town.

1364
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:10,285
No, there isn't going
to be any rebuttal.

1365
01:07:10,393 --> 01:07:11,451
What do you mean?

1366
01:07:11,561 --> 01:07:12,892
Don't talk to anyone.

1367
01:07:12,996 --> 01:07:14,759
We're pulling you
from the congressional hearing.

1368
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:16,422
No, no, no. You can't pull me
from the congressional hearing.

1369
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:17,864
All you'll be doing is giving
credence to her article.

1370
01:07:17,967 --> 01:07:19,195
I'm ready to testify.

1371
01:07:19,302 --> 01:07:20,963
Look, Nick, half of my job
is damage control.

1372
01:07:21,071 --> 01:07:22,163
Today, that consists

1373
01:07:22,272 --> 01:07:24,900
of distancing ourselves
from you entirely-

1374
01:07:25,008 --> 01:07:28,739
letting you take
all the heat on this article.

1375
01:07:28,845 --> 01:07:30,574
Your job relied on your ability
to keep secrets

1376
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:31,772
and spin the truth.

1377
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:33,576
I just cannot imagine a way

1378
01:07:33,683 --> 01:07:35,310
in which you could have fucked
up more.

1379
01:07:35,418 --> 01:07:38,251
There's just no way I could
possibly keep you on staff.

1380
01:07:38,355 --> 01:07:40,152
Then I assume you've run this
by the captain.

1381
01:07:40,256 --> 01:07:42,190
Captain died this morning.

1382
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:42,050
Mr. Naylor,
this is Pete in Security from the Academy.

1383
01:08:42,152 --> 01:08:44,017
Your things are waiting for you

1384
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,781
at the information kiosk
in the lobby.

1385
01:08:45,889 --> 01:08:47,083
Look, if you don't pick your
stuff up by Friday,

1386
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:49,522
we're instructed to throw it out.

1387
01:08:51,294 --> 01:08:54,161
Mr. Naylor, this is Special
Agent Johnson with the FBI.

1388
01:08:54,264 --> 01:08:56,926
Having not found any leads in
your kidnapping investigation,

1389
01:08:57,033 --> 01:08:58,330
we're going to be
handing over the case

1390
01:08:58,435 --> 01:08:59,493
to the local D.C. police,

1391
01:08:59,602 --> 01:09:01,797
so please refer to them
in the future

1392
01:09:01,905 --> 01:09:03,497
for any updates and questions.

1393
01:09:05,442 --> 01:09:08,036
Nick, Jack in Jeff Megall's office.

1394
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:11,580
Jeff really enjoyed
meeting you the other day

1395
01:09:11,681 --> 01:09:13,740
and he's just... he's torn up
about the fact

1396
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:15,613
that you two couldn't find
a project to work on.

1397
01:09:15,718 --> 01:09:17,845
He's really just... I don't know.

1398
01:09:17,954 --> 01:09:19,717
So, listen,
but we should hang, at least,

1399
01:09:19,823 --> 01:09:21,791
so you drop me a line
whenever you're in town.

1400
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:25,349
Uh... my e-mail is, uh...

1401
01:09:40,944 --> 01:09:42,571
Who is it?

1402
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:44,579
It's me, Nick.

1403
01:09:46,516 --> 01:09:49,041
Jill, this is a bad time.

1404
01:09:49,152 --> 01:09:50,744
Let me in.

1405
01:09:52,088 --> 01:09:53,851
No.

1406
01:09:53,957 --> 01:09:56,926
I brought someone
who needs to talk to you.

1407
01:10:02,131 --> 01:10:03,428
Hey, buddy.

1408
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:05,467
Hey, Dad.

1409
01:10:05,568 --> 01:10:07,593
Coke in the fridge.

1410
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:18,810
So, this Heather Holloway,
she must have been pretty hot.

1411
01:10:18,915 --> 01:10:21,816
Yes. She's pretty hot.

1412
01:10:21,918 --> 01:10:23,943
Don't take it so hard.

1413
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:26,681
A few flaws can be appealing.

1414
01:10:26,789 --> 01:10:27,881
Makes you human.

1415
01:10:27,991 --> 01:10:29,424
Who wants to be human?

1416
01:10:29,526 --> 01:10:30,891
Well, I know one person

1417
01:10:30,994 --> 01:10:33,963
who still thinks you're a God.

1418
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:53,176
Why did you tell that reporter
all your secrets?

1419
01:10:56,419 --> 01:10:59,047
You're too young to understand.

1420
01:10:59,155 --> 01:11:02,249
Mom says it's because
you have dependency issues

1421
01:11:02,358 --> 01:11:03,848
and it was all just
a matter of time

1422
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:06,121
before you threw it all away
on some tramp.

1423
01:11:06,229 --> 01:11:09,528
Well, that's one theory.

1424
01:11:09,632 --> 01:11:11,463
Why are you hiding from everyone?

1425
01:11:11,568 --> 01:11:17,165
It has something to do with
being generally hated right now.

1426
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:18,763
But it's your job to be
generally hated.

1427
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:21,639
It's more complicated
than that, Joey.

1428
01:11:21,744 --> 01:11:24,008
You're just making it
more complicated

1429
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:25,671
so that you can feel
sorry for yourself.

1430
01:11:25,782 --> 01:11:27,511
Like you always said,

1431
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:30,916
"If you want an easy job,
go work for the Red Cross."

1432
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:32,647
You're a lobbyist.

1433
01:11:32,755 --> 01:11:35,849
Your job is to be right, and
you're the best at what you do.

1434
01:11:37,493 --> 01:11:38,892
You're the sultan of spin.

1435
01:11:40,096 --> 01:11:41,495
"Sultan of spin"?

1436
01:11:41,598 --> 01:11:43,122
Mom subscribes to Newsweek.

1437
01:11:44,567 --> 01:11:45,898
Who cares what the Brads

1438
01:11:46,002 --> 01:11:47,026
of the world think?

1439
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:48,398
He's not my dad.

1440
01:11:50,106 --> 01:11:51,573
You are.

1441
01:11:51,674 --> 01:11:54,905
And right there,
looking into Joey’s eyes,

1442
01:11:55,011 --> 01:11:58,412
it all came back in a rush.

1443
01:11:58,514 --> 01:12:00,982
Why I do what I do-
defending the defenseless,

1444
01:12:01,084 --> 01:12:03,382
protecting the disenfranchised
corporations

1445
01:12:03,486 --> 01:12:05,545
that have been abandoned
by their very own consumers-

1446
01:12:05,655 --> 01:12:07,919
the logger...

1447
01:12:08,024 --> 01:12:10,254
the sweatshop foreman...

1448
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:12,385
the oil driller...

1449
01:12:12,495 --> 01:12:14,656
the land mine developer...

1450
01:12:14,764 --> 01:12:18,063
the baby seal poacher...

1451
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:19,566
Baby seal poacher?

1452
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:21,034
Even I think that's kind of cruel.

1453
01:12:21,137 --> 01:12:23,230
All right, you're missing the point.

1454
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:25,102
I must be, because I thought
you were apologizing.

1455
01:12:25,208 --> 01:12:26,175
I'm getting to that.

1456
01:12:26,275 --> 01:12:28,038
When?

1457
01:12:28,144 --> 01:12:30,612
Look.

1458
01:12:30,713 --> 01:12:35,548
The two of you, you're
basically my only friends,

1459
01:12:35,652 --> 01:12:37,950
and the last thing that
I would ever want to do

1460
01:12:38,054 --> 01:12:39,749
would be to hurt you.

1461
01:12:39,856 --> 01:12:41,721
And, I can only imagine...

1462
01:12:41,824 --> 01:12:42,848
Why are you smiling?

1463
01:12:42,959 --> 01:12:44,620
Why is he smiling?

1464
01:12:44,727 --> 01:12:46,820
He won a hundred bucks off of you.

1465
01:12:46,929 --> 01:12:49,955
I bet Polly you'd spill the beans
to that reporter.

1466
01:12:50,066 --> 01:12:52,534
That goes against everything
that we stand for.

1467
01:12:52,635 --> 01:12:54,899
Oh, please! You've ratted us out
to some reporter with tits!

1468
01:12:55,004 --> 01:12:56,904
Glorious tits.

1469
01:12:57,006 --> 01:12:59,304
Only after you created a betting
pool testing my incompetence?

1470
01:12:59,409 --> 01:13:01,468
Do you have any idea the beating
I'm taking at Moderation?

1471
01:13:01,577 --> 01:13:04,307
Well, look, I'm sure both of
you are under a lot of scrutiny.

1472
01:13:04,414 --> 01:13:06,609
You know what?
You can stop using the plural.

1473
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:09,913
The guys at Safety actually liked
the name "Merchants of Death."

1474
01:13:10,019 --> 01:13:11,316
They're gonna have
some bumper stickers made up.

1475
01:13:11,421 --> 01:13:13,321
I'll make sure you get one.

1476
01:13:13,423 --> 01:13:15,357
Thank you.

1477
01:13:17,527 --> 01:13:19,358
That is disgusting.

1478
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:22,459
It's American.

1479
01:13:22,565 --> 01:13:24,123
Can I have a bite?

1480
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:25,757
Mmm.

1481
01:13:25,868 --> 01:13:27,927
So I guess this means

1482
01:13:28,037 --> 01:13:31,268
you won't be appearing
at Finistirre's subcommittee.

1483
01:13:31,374 --> 01:13:33,604
Hmm. I was kind of looking
forward to it, too.

1484
01:13:33,710 --> 01:13:36,474
It's kind of cool in
a Jimmy Stewart sort of way.

1485
01:13:36,579 --> 01:13:39,104
More like an Ollie North sort of way.

1486
01:13:39,215 --> 01:13:41,445
Finistirre would have
torn you a new asshole

1487
01:13:41,551 --> 01:13:43,075
in a House of Parliament, no less.

1488
01:13:43,186 --> 01:13:44,483
I could have taken him.

1489
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:46,248
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah? What would you have said?

1490
01:13:46,355 --> 01:13:47,583
I don't know.

1491
01:13:47,690 --> 01:13:50,921
I'd just like him to feel
immeasurable pain,

1492
01:13:51,027 --> 01:13:52,494
humiliation.

1493
01:13:52,595 --> 01:13:54,062
Yeah, well, that would be
kind of tough.

1494
01:13:54,163 --> 01:13:55,528
I mean, he's already a Senator.

1495
01:13:57,467 --> 01:13:59,662
I mean, how would you get
back in even if you wanted to?

1496
01:14:03,706 --> 01:14:04,866
Uh-oh.

1497
01:14:10,813 --> 01:14:12,110
You're not gonna like this.

1498
01:14:15,218 --> 01:14:16,344
Hello.
Thanks very much for coming.

1499
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:18,784
First of all, I'd like to say
a few words

1500
01:14:18,888 --> 01:14:20,014
to all the people who
are mentioned

1501
01:14:20,123 --> 01:14:22,182
in the recent newspaper article.

1502
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:23,781
Please take comfort in knowing

1503
01:14:23,893 --> 01:14:27,659
that I will not rest until
your names are cleared.

1504
01:14:27,764 --> 01:14:29,857
This experience has taught me
an important lesson-

1505
01:14:29,966 --> 01:14:31,763
having sexual affairs
with members of the press

1506
01:14:31,868 --> 01:14:33,358
is just unfair.

1507
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:35,300
It's not unfair to me, mind you,

1508
01:14:35,404 --> 01:14:38,862
but to all the people in my life
whose only crime is knowing me.

1509
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:42,172
It was your names, not mine,
that suffered

1510
01:14:42,278 --> 01:14:44,803
from a meaningless affair
with a seductress

1511
01:14:44,914 --> 01:14:48,372
in the form of a young
brunette Washington reporter

1512
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:50,042
whose name I won't mention

1513
01:14:50,153 --> 01:14:52,087
because I have dignity.

1514
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:55,014
Mr. Naylor!

1515
01:14:55,124 --> 01:14:56,921
Are you still planning
on testifying

1516
01:14:57,026 --> 01:14:59,119
at tomorrow's subcommittee
hearing on tobacco?

1517
01:14:59,228 --> 01:15:01,492
I'm glad you asked that question.

1518
01:15:01,597 --> 01:15:03,360
There have been wide accusations of me
dropping out of tomorrow's hearing.

1519
01:15:03,466 --> 01:15:04,694
Let it be known

1520
01:15:04,801 --> 01:15:06,530
that unless Senator Finistirre
has withdrawn my invitation

1521
01:15:06,636 --> 01:15:08,069
- to speak, it is my plan
- It's called a subpoena.

1522
01:15:08,171 --> 01:15:10,002
to be in Congress tomorrow
to share my knowledge

1523
01:15:10,106 --> 01:15:12,370
of big tobacco and all those
who enjoy its products.

1524
01:15:12,475 --> 01:15:13,737
Thank you very much.
I'll see you tomorrow.

1525
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:15,996
Still feel like Jimmy Stewart?

1526
01:16:27,016 --> 01:16:28,005
Good.

1527
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:37,184
Why don't you all go ahead?

1528
01:16:37,293 --> 01:16:38,817
This could be a while.

1529
01:16:43,699 --> 01:16:48,727
If we could, um... if we could
take our seats, please.

1530
01:16:51,474 --> 01:16:54,034
Gentlemen, ladies.

1531
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:56,873
If I may call this meeting to order.

1532
01:16:56,979 --> 01:17:01,746
We'll do everything we can to
keep things brief and concise

1533
01:17:01,851 --> 01:17:03,375
so that we can all
get out of here on time.

1534
01:17:03,486 --> 01:17:06,978
The skull and crossbones
means one thing:

1535
01:17:07,089 --> 01:17:08,556
Poison.

1536
01:17:08,658 --> 01:17:11,354
Thus, the message is quite clear.

1537
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,621
Like any other product
that carries the branding,

1538
01:17:13,729 --> 01:17:16,960
if you take it, you will die.

1539
01:17:17,066 --> 01:17:20,126
Yes, but isn't this overkill?

1540
01:17:20,236 --> 01:17:23,501
Why don't we just use words,
as we currently do?

1541
01:17:23,606 --> 01:17:27,406
Something that describes the
dangers of cigarette smoking.

1542
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:28,534
Well, the American public
is not affected

1543
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:30,111
by masthead anymore.

1544
01:17:30,212 --> 01:17:31,372
They need images.

1545
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,846
We've done studies
which show that consumers react

1546
01:17:33,950 --> 01:17:36,510
up to 80% more to imagery
rather than words.

1547
01:17:36,619 --> 01:17:37,916
The stats are there.

1548
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:39,817
It's just sad

1549
01:17:39,922 --> 01:17:42,254
that the Academy of Tobacco
Studies did not release

1550
01:17:42,358 --> 01:17:43,757
this type of information earlier.

1551
01:17:43,859 --> 01:17:46,828
When you say
the Academy of Tobacco Studies,

1552
01:17:46,929 --> 01:17:48,260
you're referring to...

1553
01:17:48,364 --> 01:17:49,490
Yes.

1554
01:17:49,598 --> 01:17:51,327
to the coalition...

1555
01:17:51,434 --> 01:17:52,366
Yes, the coalition.

1556
01:17:52,468 --> 01:17:54,060
The big... big tobacco...

1557
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:55,432
...that is represented by...

1558
01:17:55,538 --> 01:17:56,766
By, um...

1559
01:17:56,872 --> 01:17:57,998
And specifically

1560
01:17:58,107 --> 01:17:59,005
Mr...

1561
01:17:59,108 --> 01:18:00,166
Um...

1562
01:18:00,276 --> 01:18:01,868
Mr., uh, Nick Naylor.

1563
01:18:01,978 --> 01:18:02,876
Nick Naylor?

1564
01:18:02,979 --> 01:18:03,946
Thank you very much.

1565
01:18:05,948 --> 01:18:06,846
The current use

1566
01:18:06,949 --> 01:18:08,576
of words instead of imagery

1567
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:12,279
is an obvious move against
the non-English-speaking population

1568
01:18:12,388 --> 01:18:13,855
of the United States.

1569
01:18:13,956 --> 01:18:16,083
The skull and crossbones

1570
01:18:16,192 --> 01:18:19,559
speak loudly in all languages.

1571
01:18:19,662 --> 01:18:22,256
By not using it,
they're saying

1572
01:18:22,365 --> 01:18:26,392
they want those who can't
read English to die.

1573
01:18:26,502 --> 01:18:28,265
Hmm. Senor Herrera,

1574
01:18:28,371 --> 01:18:31,204
could you clarify "they"?

1575
01:18:31,307 --> 01:18:32,604
Let it be known,

1576
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:35,176
the public beating
has not gone out of style.

1577
01:18:42,518 --> 01:18:44,679
Nick Naylor, please step forward.

1578
01:18:54,397 --> 01:18:57,025
You go sit with him.

1579
01:19:05,408 --> 01:19:08,400
Please state your name,
address and current occupation.

1580
01:19:08,511 --> 01:19:09,637
My name is Nick Naylor.

1581
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:11,508
I live at 6000
Massachusetts Avenue

1582
01:19:11,614 --> 01:19:13,514
and I am currently unemployed,

1583
01:19:13,616 --> 01:19:15,743
but until recently,
I was the vice president

1584
01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:17,341
of the Academy of Tobacco Studies.

1585
01:19:17,453 --> 01:19:18,351
Mr. Naylor,

1586
01:19:18,454 --> 01:19:21,912
as vice president
of the Academy

1587
01:19:22,024 --> 01:19:23,992
of Tobacco Studies,
what was required of you?

1588
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:25,321
What did you do?

1589
01:19:25,428 --> 01:19:28,920
I informed the public
of all the research performed

1590
01:19:29,031 --> 01:19:31,022
in the investigation
on the effects of tobacco.

1591
01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:32,259
Mm-hmm,
and what,

1592
01:19:32,368 --> 01:19:34,928
so far,
has the Academy concluded

1593
01:19:35,037 --> 01:19:37,471
in their investigation
into the effects of tobacco?

1594
01:19:37,573 --> 01:19:39,837
Well, many things, actually.

1595
01:19:39,942 --> 01:19:41,705
Why, just the other day
they uncovered evidence

1596
01:19:41,811 --> 01:19:43,642
that smoking can offset
Parkinson's disease.

1597
01:19:45,581 --> 01:19:46,809
I'm sure the health
community

1598
01:19:46,916 --> 01:19:48,042
is thrilled.

1599
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:51,051
Mr. Naylor, who provides
the financial backing

1600
01:19:51,153 --> 01:19:53,121
for the Academy of Tobacco Studies?

1601
01:19:53,222 --> 01:19:56,487
Uh... Conglomerated Tobacco.

1602
01:19:56,592 --> 01:19:58,287
That's the cigarette companies.

1603
01:19:58,394 --> 01:20:00,453
For the most part, yes.

1604
01:20:00,563 --> 01:20:03,464
Do you think that...

1605
01:20:03,566 --> 01:20:05,534
might affect their priorities?

1606
01:20:05,634 --> 01:20:06,965
No, just as I'm sure

1607
01:20:07,069 --> 01:20:08,900
campaign contributions
don't affect yours.

1608
01:20:09,004 --> 01:20:10,028
Ohh.

1609
01:20:12,007 --> 01:20:15,238
Senators, Mr. Naylor is not here
to testify on the goings-on

1610
01:20:15,344 --> 01:20:17,141
of the Academy of Tobacco Studies.

1611
01:20:17,246 --> 01:20:19,305
We're here to examine
the possibility

1612
01:20:19,415 --> 01:20:20,814
of a warning logo on cigarettes.

1613
01:20:20,916 --> 01:20:21,883
Now, Mr. Naylor,

1614
01:20:21,984 --> 01:20:23,508
I have to ask you,
out of formality,

1615
01:20:23,619 --> 01:20:25,587
do you believe that smoking
cigarettes, over time,

1616
01:20:25,688 --> 01:20:28,919
can lead to lung cancer and
other respiratory conditions

1617
01:20:29,024 --> 01:20:30,218
such as emphysema?

1618
01:20:32,094 --> 01:20:33,584
Yes.

1619
01:20:36,432 --> 01:20:37,330
In fact, I think you'd be
hard-pressed

1620
01:20:37,433 --> 01:20:38,525
to find someone
who really believes

1621
01:20:38,634 --> 01:20:40,602
that cigarettes are not
potentially harmful.

1622
01:20:40,703 --> 01:20:42,933
I mean, show of hands,
who out here thinks

1623
01:20:43,038 --> 01:20:44,528
- that cigarettes aren't dangerous...
- Mr. Naylor.

1624
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:47,768
There's no need for theatrics.

1625
01:20:47,877 --> 01:20:50,437
Sir, I just don't see the point in a warning
label for something people already know.

1626
01:20:50,546 --> 01:20:51,843
The warning symbol

1627
01:20:51,947 --> 01:20:55,576
is a reminder, a reminder of the
dangers of smoking cigarettes.

1628
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:57,515
Well, if we want to remind
people of danger,

1629
01:20:57,620 --> 01:20:59,144
why don't we slap
a skull and crossbones

1630
01:20:59,255 --> 01:21:00,222
on all Boeing airplanes,

1631
01:21:00,322 --> 01:21:01,755
Senator Lothridge?

1632
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:02,789
And all Fords, Senator Dupree?

1633
01:21:02,892 --> 01:21:05,224
That is ridiculous.

1634
01:21:05,327 --> 01:21:07,625
The death toll from airline
and automobile accidents

1635
01:21:07,730 --> 01:21:09,789
doesn't even skim the surface
of cigarettes.

1636
01:21:09,899 --> 01:21:10,957
They don't even compare.

1637
01:21:11,066 --> 01:21:13,125
Oh, this from a senator
who calls Vermont home.

1638
01:21:13,235 --> 01:21:15,362
I don't follow you, Mr. Naylor.

1639
01:21:15,471 --> 01:21:17,132
Well, the real

1640
01:21:17,239 --> 01:21:19,799
demonstrated number one killer
in America is cholesterol,

1641
01:21:19,909 --> 01:21:20,898
and here comes
Senator Finistirre,

1642
01:21:21,010 --> 01:21:23,240
whose fine state is,
I regret to say,

1643
01:21:23,345 --> 01:21:26,371
clogging the nation's arteries
with Vermont cheddar cheese.

1644
01:21:28,017 --> 01:21:30,747
If we want to talk numbers,
how about the millions of people

1645
01:21:30,853 --> 01:21:31,820
dying of heart attacks.

1646
01:21:31,921 --> 01:21:33,183
Perhaps Vermont cheddar

1647
01:21:33,289 --> 01:21:35,655
should come
with a skull and crossbones.

1648
01:21:35,758 --> 01:21:37,589
That is lud...

1649
01:21:37,693 --> 01:21:38,660
The great state of Vermont

1650
01:21:38,761 --> 01:21:40,319
will not apologize for its cheese.

1651
01:21:40,429 --> 01:21:41,396
Mr. Naylor,

1652
01:21:41,497 --> 01:21:42,987
we are here to discuss cigarettes.

1653
01:21:43,098 --> 01:21:46,727
Not planes, not cars- cigarettes.

1654
01:21:46,835 --> 01:21:49,497
Now, as we discussed earlier,
these warning labels

1655
01:21:49,605 --> 01:21:52,802
are not for those who know, but
rather for those who don't know.

1656
01:21:54,777 --> 01:21:56,768
What about the children?

1657
01:21:56,879 --> 01:21:58,904
Gentlemen...

1658
01:21:59,014 --> 01:22:00,948
it's called education.

1659
01:22:01,050 --> 01:22:02,915
It doesn't come off the side
of a cigarette carton.

1660
01:22:03,018 --> 01:22:04,076
It comes from our teachers,

1661
01:22:04,186 --> 01:22:06,245
and more importantly, our parents.

1662
01:22:06,355 --> 01:22:09,483
It is the job
of every parent

1663
01:22:09,592 --> 01:22:13,221
to warn their children of all
the dangers of the world,

1664
01:22:13,329 --> 01:22:15,889
including cigarettes, so that
one day, when they get older,

1665
01:22:15,998 --> 01:22:17,829
they can choose for themselves.

1666
01:22:20,069 --> 01:22:23,232
I look at my... son

1667
01:22:23,339 --> 01:22:24,738
who...

1668
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:26,671
was kind enough
to come with me today,

1669
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:29,266
and I can't help but think

1670
01:22:29,378 --> 01:22:31,642
that I am responsible
for his growth

1671
01:22:31,747 --> 01:22:33,874
and his development.

1672
01:22:33,983 --> 01:22:35,507
And I'm proud of that.

1673
01:22:35,618 --> 01:22:36,880
Well, having
said that,

1674
01:22:36,986 --> 01:22:39,546
would you condone him smoking?

1675
01:22:39,655 --> 01:22:41,987
Well, of course not.
He's not 18.

1676
01:22:42,091 --> 01:22:43,149
That would be illegal.

1677
01:22:44,426 --> 01:22:46,519
Yes, I-I heard you deliver
that line on 20-20,

1678
01:22:46,629 --> 01:22:47,994
but enough dancing.

1679
01:22:48,097 --> 01:22:50,429
What are you going to do
when he turns 18?

1680
01:22:52,101 --> 01:22:53,659
Come on, Mr. Naylor.

1681
01:22:53,769 --> 01:22:57,330
On his 18th birthday, will
you share a cigarette with him?

1682
01:22:57,439 --> 01:22:59,669
Will you spend
a lovely afternoon,

1683
01:22:59,775 --> 01:23:01,936
like one of your ludicrous
cigarette advertisements?

1684
01:23:02,044 --> 01:23:03,568
You seem to have a lot to say

1685
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:05,010
about how we
should raise our children.

1686
01:23:05,114 --> 01:23:06,081
What of your own?

1687
01:23:06,181 --> 01:23:08,649
What are you
going to do

1688
01:23:08,751 --> 01:23:11,049
when he turns 18?

1689
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:21,323
If he really wants a cigarette,
I'll buy him his first pack.

1690
01:23:26,068 --> 01:23:28,901
Thank you for your testimony,
Mr. Naylor. You're excused.

1691
01:23:35,744 --> 01:23:37,177
I'll meet you outside, okay?

1692
01:23:49,758 --> 01:23:51,316
Great.

1693
01:23:51,427 --> 01:23:52,553
Well done, my boy.

1694
01:23:52,661 --> 01:23:54,788
Were you in the same room as me?

1695
01:23:54,897 --> 01:23:55,989
The whole personal choice thing?

1696
01:23:56,098 --> 01:23:57,224
They ate that shit up.

1697
01:23:57,333 --> 01:23:59,164
Just checked the whip count.

1698
01:23:59,268 --> 01:24:00,667
That bill is going down in flames.

1699
01:24:00,769 --> 01:24:03,602
Your speech was unorthodox,
but you did it, boy.

1700
01:24:03,706 --> 01:24:04,604
You crushed the fucker.

1701
01:24:04,707 --> 01:24:05,833
That's good news for you guys.

1702
01:24:05,941 --> 01:24:07,340
Oh. Whoa, whoa.

1703
01:24:07,443 --> 01:24:10,344
We're still a team, right?

1704
01:24:10,446 --> 01:24:12,414
What about damage control?

1705
01:24:13,916 --> 01:24:15,281
Look, Nick.

1706
01:24:15,384 --> 01:24:18,979
Winston-Salem is ready
to do whatever it takes

1707
01:24:19,088 --> 01:24:20,612
to keep you onboard.

1708
01:24:28,864 --> 01:24:31,924
Nick, will you continue
fighting for cigarettes?

1709
01:24:32,034 --> 01:24:33,365
Of course he will.

1710
01:24:33,469 --> 01:24:35,437
This man here is our general.

1711
01:24:35,537 --> 01:24:37,300
We're not just gonna let him retire.

1712
01:24:37,406 --> 01:24:38,430
Is that correct, Nick?

1713
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:40,030
You're sticking with tobacco?

1714
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:47,571
Now, I know what
you're probably thinking.

1715
01:24:47,683 --> 01:24:48,843
What a great opportunity for me

1716
01:24:48,951 --> 01:24:50,543
to teach Joey
how to use leverage against

1717
01:24:50,652 --> 01:24:52,244
a backstabbing boss.

1718
01:24:52,354 --> 01:24:55,790
But I actually meant what
I said about responsibility.

1719
01:24:55,891 --> 01:24:59,520
Some things
are just more important

1720
01:24:59,628 --> 01:25:00,788
than paying a mortgage.

1721
01:25:00,896 --> 01:25:03,490
So I did the only responsible
thing I could.

1722
01:25:03,599 --> 01:25:06,363
I turned down the job.

1723
01:25:06,468 --> 01:25:08,800
And my timing
couldn't have been better.

1724
01:25:08,904 --> 01:25:11,202
Within a few months,
the cigarette companies

1725
01:25:11,306 --> 01:25:12,705
settled
with the American smoker

1726
01:25:12,808 --> 01:25:15,470
to the tune of $246 billion.

1727
01:25:16,645 --> 01:25:18,977
And the Academy
of Tobacco Studies

1728
01:25:19,081 --> 01:25:20,844
was permanently dismantled.

1729
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:23,247
For the first time in decades,

1730
01:25:23,352 --> 01:25:25,047
BR found himself out of work.

1731
01:25:26,822 --> 01:25:28,915
Otherwise, not much has changed.

1732
01:25:29,024 --> 01:25:31,185
The MOD squad still meets every week.

1733
01:25:31,293 --> 01:25:32,590
Nice.

1734
01:25:32,694 --> 01:25:34,958
We even added a few new members.

1735
01:25:35,063 --> 01:25:37,861
The things I could learn
from you, BobbyJay.

1736
01:25:37,966 --> 01:25:38,955
Right.

1737
01:25:39,067 --> 01:25:40,500
Stick around. Stick around.

1738
01:25:40,602 --> 01:25:43,332
Senator Finistirre is still
fighting for his causes.

1739
01:25:43,439 --> 01:25:45,202
What do you say
to the people who claim

1740
01:25:45,307 --> 01:25:47,241
you are destroying cinema classics?

1741
01:25:47,342 --> 01:25:48,969
Mmm, no. All
we're doing

1742
01:25:49,077 --> 01:25:50,738
is using
digital technology

1743
01:25:50,846 --> 01:25:54,009
to tastefully update
movies of the past...

1744
01:25:54,116 --> 01:25:55,674
by removing cigarettes.

1745
01:25:55,784 --> 01:25:59,015
I believe that if these
stars were alive today,

1746
01:25:59,121 --> 01:26:01,555
they would agree that
we're doing the right thing.

1747
01:26:01,657 --> 01:26:03,386
But, in essence, aren't
you changing history?

1748
01:26:03,492 --> 01:26:07,428
No, I think we're improving history.

1749
01:26:09,298 --> 01:26:10,629
Even Heather is still reporting.

1750
01:26:10,732 --> 01:26:12,097
The whole town has been evacuated.

1751
01:26:12,201 --> 01:26:17,503
They're calling this
the storm of the century.

1752
01:26:17,606 --> 01:26:18,937
Not much changes at all.

1753
01:26:19,041 --> 01:26:23,740
And this year's Foggy Bottom
Debating Society Champion is...

1754
01:26:23,846 --> 01:26:24,835
Joey Naylor.

1755
01:26:24,947 --> 01:26:26,107
- Yay!
- Yay!

1756
01:26:26,215 --> 01:26:27,113
Joey!

1757
01:26:27,216 --> 01:26:28,114
Joey!

1758
01:26:28,217 --> 01:26:29,115
Joey, Joey!

1759
01:26:29,218 --> 01:26:30,742
That's my boy.

1760
01:26:30,853 --> 01:26:32,411
Hold it up. Hold it up.

1761
01:26:36,058 --> 01:26:38,083
And me?

1762
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:40,889
Well, there's still a place
for guys like me.

1763
01:26:40,996 --> 01:26:43,624
So, be straight with me.

1764
01:26:43,732 --> 01:26:46,462
Is it true?

1765
01:26:46,568 --> 01:26:47,967
- It could be.
- Come on.

1766
01:26:48,070 --> 01:26:50,163
We know of very few cases.

1767
01:26:50,272 --> 01:26:51,398
There's no scientific proof at all.

1768
01:26:51,507 --> 01:26:52,405
There was an unfortunate
incident out in Iowa...

1769
01:26:52,508 --> 01:26:53,475
It's really a complicated situation.

1770
01:26:53,575 --> 01:26:54,769
Gentlemen,

1771
01:26:54,877 --> 01:26:57,471
practice these words
in front of the mirror.

1772
01:26:57,579 --> 01:27:00,548
"Although we are constantly
exploring the subject,

1773
01:27:00,649 --> 01:27:03,345
"currently,
there is no direct evidence

1774
01:27:03,452 --> 01:27:04,851
"that links cell phone usage

1775
01:27:04,953 --> 01:27:06,818
to brain cancer."

1776
01:27:13,328 --> 01:27:15,125
Michael Jordan plays ball.

1777
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:16,788
Charles Manson kills people.

1778
01:27:16,899 --> 01:27:18,366
I talk.

1779
01:27:20,035 --> 01:27:21,161
Everyone has a talent.
