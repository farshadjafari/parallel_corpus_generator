1
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,317
THREE MONTHS EARLIER.
SOMEWHERE IN WHAT WAS ONCE
THE SOVIET UNION

2
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,596
- Hi.
- Hi, come in.

3
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,276
- Shall we go?
- Sure, I just have to pack my things.

4
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,558
- What things?
- My things. I'm moving!

5
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,995
- Where?
- The States!

6
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:56,190
- What?! The States?
- It's true! You know mom’s boyfriend?

7
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,632
He lives in America.
Mom's moving there and I'm going with.

8
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,314
- What you gonna do there?
- I don’t know. We leave on Friday.

9
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,152
- You're kidding!
- It's true!

10
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,797
- It's a dumb joke.
- It's true. What am I gonna do here?

11
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,752
- I can’t believe you're moving.
- Believe it, I'm going...

12
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,957
- Can I pay for a pack of Marlboro later?
- No, you can't.

13
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,950
- Wall Street, then?
- I said no.

14
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,671
- We always can with the other cashier.
- Don’t lie, girls.

15
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,559
- We're not lying. We can...
- I said no!

16
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,396
- Bitch!
- What?!

17
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,836
- What you doing!
- Doesn’t matter, I'm off to America!

18
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,957
How come
you decided to go to America?

19
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:01,035
Mom met her boyfriend
through one of those dating agencies.

20
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,034
He's Russian,
but he lives in America.

21
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,111
It's incredible!

22
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:12,872
- Shit... I'd also like to go away.
- You can visit me in America!

23
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,473
What's this about “America, America"?
What's she shouting about?

24
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,679
- She's going there.
- You're just lying. Really?

25
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,954
- Can't I come with?
- No.

26
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,351
Take me with you. I speak English.

27
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,676
<i>Hello, my name Is Volodya.</i>

28
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,758
Fool...

29
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:54,118
Listen... there was something
your mother wanted to say to you.

30
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,392
Go on.

31
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,399
Well...
Sergei and I have discussed it-

32
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,199
- And decided it's best
if we go over first.

33
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,390
We'll go first
and you'll come a little later.

34
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,552
- You're big now.
- What!? I'm going to live here alone?

35
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,076
That's just how it is.

36
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,870
If it doesn't suit you...
then you don't need to come at all!

37
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,919
It's just me and you.
Just the two of us.

38
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,518
- I’ll just say goodbye. Be right back.
- Fine.

39
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,234
Honey... I have to go now.

40
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,395
I left some money.
I'll send more when I get there.

41
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,868
Aunt Anna will be here soon.

42
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,440
Can’t you at least give me a hug?
I'm leaving.

43
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,868
Fine...

44
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,800
- Goodbye...
- Bye.

45
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,910
Wait, mom!

46
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,753
Mom! Don't go!

47
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,151
- My little daughter...
- Don’t leave me, please!

48
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,595
Don’t leave me, mom!

49
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,877
Don't go, stay with me,
I won't make it!

50
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,236
Don't go, mom!

51
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,829
If we don’t leave now...

52
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,276
- I'll call. I'll call you!
- Mom!

53
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,596
I'll call when I get there!

54
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,795
- Who is it?
- Anna.

55
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,911
- So... Has she left?
- Yes.

56
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,512
- Get dressed.
- What?

57
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,673
- Let's go, we're off to your new flat.
- What new flat?

58
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:36,470
- You're going to live in another flat.
- What?

59
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,792
This flat's too big for you.
I told you to get dressed.

60
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,953
- I'm not going. This is my flat!
- You must obey me.

61
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,434
Let's go.

62
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,235
Here it is.

63
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,350
The old man that lived here died a few
weeks ago. These are his things.

64
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,155
- Are you crazy? I'm gonna live here?
- Yes, you will.

65
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,073
As long as your mother isn’t here,
I decide.

66
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,312
Everything's here: fridge, windows,
it's warm...

67
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,076
- Why can't I live in my flat?
- No one can pay for it.

68
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,515
I can't and you can't.

69
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,796
- If you don't...
- No way I'm living here!

70
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,077
If you don't want to live here,
live on the street.

71
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,756
- You bitch!
- It's the streets or an orphanage!

72
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,829
- Hi, Lilya.
- Hi.

73
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,079
VOLODYA

74
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,633
Our Father, who art in heaven.
Hallowed be thy Name.

75
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,109
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done.

76
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:10,956
On earth as it is in Heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread

77
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,157
And forgive us our trespasses. As we
forgive those that trespass against us.

78
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,118
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

79
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,319
For thine is the kingdom, and the power,
and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.

80
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,148
Very good.

81
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,630
You could do better.

82
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,797
Are you still here?
I thought you'd gone to America.

83
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,795
You did really well in the test.

84
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,077
- A golden future awaits you.
- What?

85
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,991
I was kidding.

86
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,519
Go to hell, bitch! You can be sure
I have a golden future ahead of me.

87
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,558
Hello!

88
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,514
Where are you going?

89
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,073
- Can I come with?
- No, you can't.

90
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,358
- You can have glue if I can come.
- Let's see.

91
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,874
Wow, are those Nikes? Real ones?

92
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,000
<i>My little sun, rise up...</i>

93
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,640
- Look at all the medicine I found.
- Wow...

94
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,155
- Where'd you find it?
- The toilet.

95
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,788
- It's not mine.
- Whose is it?

96
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,873
- Maybe the old man that lived here.
- What's this?

97
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,678
Give it here!

98
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,559
What you doing! Kids shouldn't drink!

99
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,955
Hey, look what I found!

100
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,595
- Let's play war.
- Put one on him.

101
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,796
The old man was a war hero.

102
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,477
- Check out the war hero!
- Salute him!

103
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,072
- Volodya, sit down. Sit down!
- Relax!

104
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,351
What's all this noise?
Could you keep it quiet?

105
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:07,559
Come in, don’t be angry. We've got
cough medicine. You can have some.

106
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,838
- I don’t have a cough.
- It's good for everything. Come in.

107
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,279
If you don't calm down, I'll call the
police. And I'm calling your aunt.

108
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,720
That's enough. Hey, that's enough.

109
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,716
- Come on, I'll turn the light out.
- You're too young. Cut it out.

110
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,836
Calm yourself, you're too young.
Find yourself another girl.

111
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,718
- Cut it out.
- Go away.

112
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,152
What's going on here?!

113
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,752
What's going on?!

114
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,037
I like it here. Are you nuts, or what?!

115
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,037
Get out!

116
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,399
Trash!

117
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,357
Go on! Get out of here now!

118
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,435
Out!

119
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,910
Don’t touch me!

120
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,278
Go to hell! Just you remember
that I decide around here.

121
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,159
Watch yourself, or it'll get worse!

122
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,070
<i>Get out of the housel</i>

123
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,597
Get out of here! You runt!
You fucking son of a bitch!

124
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,076
Volodya!

125
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,435
Volodya, what are you doing?

126
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,909
- I'm just sitting here.
- Come down.

127
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,799
- I'm just sitting here.
- Come down, please.

128
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,759
- Come down!
- I don’t want to.

129
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,229
- Come down.
- No, I won’t.

130
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,039
- Come down.
- Alright, alright...

131
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,159
Hey, you want to go for a ride?

132
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,880
- No.
- 100 crowns.

133
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,759
- Piss off!
- 200.

134
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,559
- Go to hell!
- You're not that pretty...

135
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,473
- Fuck off, you asshole!
- I can ask, can't I?

136
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:43,119
I must get out of here.
Anything, but not this.

137
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,631
- Good night.
- Are you going home?

138
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:52,078
- I'm tired, I'm going home.
- Can't I stay over at your place?

139
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,518
- No.
- Why not? It's so cold outside.

140
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,590
I can't go home. I've been thrown out.

141
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,234
Dad went crazy. I don't know why.

142
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,437
Please... Lilya.

143
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,919
I can sleep on the floor.

144
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,270
You can sleep on the sofa. But
no funny stuff or I'll throw you out.

145
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,397
You know what I'm thinking?

146
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:29,951
That we’re like a real family.
We're sitting having dinner...

147
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,829
...I come home from work
and you've baked bread.

148
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,316
Lilya...? What do you think would have
happened if I'd been two years older?

149
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,119
Cut it out...

150
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,511
Seriously...

151
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,631
Don't talk like that... it's stupid.

152
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,152
You know what?
I did think of jumping.

153
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,038
- Really?
- Yeah.

154
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,590
- Why?
- 'Cause all of this is bullshit.

155
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,194
I don’t want to live anymore.

156
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,873
Yeah, you do!

157
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,272
Course you want to!

158
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,594
You saved my life.
Now I'm gonna save yours.

159
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,154
A packet of Wall Street, please.

160
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,798
27, please.

161
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,200
I'll just have the potato chips
and cigarettes.

162
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,952
Put the juice back where it belongs.

163
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,759
Come back!

164
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:20,038
You didn't get any letters today.
I think your mother's forgotten you.

165
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,111
No, I want to sit here...

166
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,593
It just takes a few minutes.

167
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,709
Okay if they're young guys,
but if they're disgusting old men...

168
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,156
On the other hand it's much quicker.
One, two and it's over!

169
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,835
Then you get the money
and can buy a dress or something.

170
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,479
No, never. It's horrible!

171
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,355
Let's go!

172
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,949
- How was it?
- Okay.

173
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,113
I'm freezing! Tell me how it was.

174
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,431
Forget it. Let's get home, it's so cold!

175
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,112
- Who is it?
- Natasha.

176
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,878
I came to give you the money back.
I don’t need it.

177
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,157
Okay... Bye.

178
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,392
Natasha!

179
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,949
- Hi.
- Hi.

180
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,840
- Tell me what the hell's going on?
- Let's go over there and I'll explain.

181
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,110
So. What's happening?

182
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,872
Like... my dad found the money...

183
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,271
And I thought it didn't make
any difference to you.

184
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,878
What doesn't make
any difference to me?

185
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:02,033
You don’t have any parents.
I mean, your mom's in the States.

186
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,875
What doesn’t make
any difference to me?

187
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,716
Like... I told dad
that it was your money.

188
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,078
- That you did what I did.
- You said that I did it?

189
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:22,472
Yeah, you know. If my dad
had known, he would have killed me!

190
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,428
- You've got a screw loose!
- What difference does it make to you?!

191
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,070
- You're moving to the States...
- I thought you were my friend!

192
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,949
- Then you say things like that!
- Natasha...

193
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,790
Let's go... Come on.

194
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,594
I don’t need your money.

195
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,354
Keep your money! Whore!

196
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,712
LILYA

197
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,153
Guys, let's have fun.

198
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,559
It's our little whore!
Fucking slut! What you doing here?

199
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:23,110
Get the fuck out of here. You rat!

200
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,236
You selling yourself to kids?

201
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,676
- Forget them. Let's go.
- That's just what I'm doing.

202
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,071
Cunt! What're you doing there?
Come here!

203
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,832
- How's business?
- The little guy, is he a new client?

204
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,309
- Let's go.
- I'm not finished yet.

205
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,675
She's a dumb ass, she doesn't get it...

206
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,719
- Come, let's get out of here.
- I haven't finished writing yet.

207
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,916
Get out of our yard,
we don't wanna see your face!

208
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:57,837
LILYA4-EVER

209
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,672
Now, I'm done. Let's go...

210
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,117
Stay there!

211
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,999
Where the hell are you going?!

212
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:12,188
You fucking piece of trash,
go slit your throat, you cunt!

213
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,634
- You won't eat anything warm today.
- What?

214
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:30,756
- The Electricity Board cut you off.
- What?!

215
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,436
Damn...

216
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,197
Anna!

217
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,596
- No one's there. Your aunt has moved.
- She's moved?

218
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,275
Yes. My God, you've grown.

219
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,513
- I remember when you were this small.
- What? Where's she moved?

220
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,553
Open up, I know you’re in there!

221
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,557
How are you? You happy here?

222
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:25,389
I'm an old and sick woman.
I need a comfortable home.

223
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,471
You understand?

224
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,516
- Have you spoken to mom?
- No.

225
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,276
- Has she written or called?
- She hasn’t written or called.

226
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,432
Let me watch TV in peace...

227
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,598
- I don’t have any money.
- Neither do I.

228
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:58,638
They've cut off the electricity
and I've got nothing to eat.

229
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,315
- Get a job.
- How can I, I'm in school?

230
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,631
So, do what your mother did.

231
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:11,318
Go into town and spread your legs.
Now leave me in peace.

232
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,038
<i>Shut the door!</i>

233
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,514
- You know what?
- What?

234
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:54,309
I read in a magazine-

235
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:00,396
- About when different stars are born.
I'm born the same day as Britney Spears.

236
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:05,350
- Really?
- Yeah... but four years apart.

237
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,478
- But you have the same birthday?
- Yeah...

238
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:14,830
Imagine if you were mixed up in hospital,
then you'd be Britney Spears.

239
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:20,238
But we’re not born in the same year
and she lives in the States.

240
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,278
But think how cool it would have been...

241
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,758
Yeah, sure...

242
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:31,271
- You know when my birthday is?
- No.

243
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,193
- Today.
- Really?

244
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,394
- You're not kidding?
- No...

245
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,630
- Congratulations!
- Thanks.

246
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,394
Did you get any presents?

247
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,953
I promise I'll get you a nice present.

248
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,839
I swear... But not today.

249
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,231
I didn't know it was your birthday
and I've got no money.

250
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:58,149
- But you’ll get a real present from me.
- You don’t have to.

251
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,470
Yeah, I'm giving you a present.

252
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:22,433
- Are you going to school?
- No... and you?

253
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,669
No.

254
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,590
- What you gonna do?
- I have to do laundry.

255
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,637
I've got no clean clothes.

256
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,275
But I don’t have any washing powder.
I don’t know.

257
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,198
Look...

258
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,679
- Shall we try some?
- Volodya, stop it.

259
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:49,031
- Let's try them.
- Volodya, you can't...

260
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,078
Volodya, put it back. Don’t touch it.

261
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,838
Put it away.

262
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,110
Volodya! Stop it!

263
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,829
Did you swallow them?

264
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,111
Volodya, did you swallow them?

265
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,834
What is it?

266
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,633
What is it? Volodya!

267
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,996
Don’t leave! Volodya... Volodya!

268
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,879
Don't die, please, Volodya!

269
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,834
A kiss?

270
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,231
I must have been in heaven...

271
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,549
- I've turned into an angel.
- Get out, go to hell, you moron!

272
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,310
- Go to hell!
- Sorry...

273
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,199
Idiot! Get out!

274
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,237
- Get out!
- Sorry...

275
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,320
FOR SALE

276
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:24,111
- Do you want to buy anything?
- There's nothing to buy here!

277
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,590
Hi...

278
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,514
Are you still angry?

279
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,876
Forgive me, I'll never do it again...

280
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,149
How's it going?

281
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,550
Have you sold anything?

282
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,271
Not a bloody thing. Fucking crap!

283
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,836
You do that again
and I'll really kill you!

284
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,589
- Shall we go to the Pentagon?
- The Pentagon?

285
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:21,356
- The submarine base.
- I know. What shall we do there?

286
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,239
I've got some glue there.

287
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,435
- I live there.
- You live there?

288
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,558
Well, when they throw me
out of the house.

289
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,553
My dad worked here.
He was in the army.

290
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,188
My mom also worked here.

291
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:56,591
- My mom worked in this kitchen.
- Your mother cooked food?

292
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,110
And your dad?

293
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:04,432
He was in the army
and came here for a little while...

294
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,720
He probably just wanted
to sleep with my mom.

295
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,919
Then she got pregnant
and he moved to Moscow.

296
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,679
She wrote to him, but he didn't answer.
I've never seen him.

297
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,271
Come on, I'm freezing.

298
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,550
"Speech given by the General
Secretary, Comrade Brezhnev..."

299
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:42,590
"Comrade members of the Central
Committee, comrade delegates..."

300
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:50,436
"Comrades. 50 years ago an event of
great historical importance took place."

301
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:55,269
"Prolonged and thundering applause.
Everyone stands up."

302
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,789
I live here. Look, this is my room.

303
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,797
See, I've got glue.

304
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,079
Take it.

305
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,915
I'm freezing...

306
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,556
We can build a hut.

307
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,114
What hut?

308
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:37,038
To get warm.

309
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,549
It's warmer, isn’t it?

310
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,230
It's like lying in a coffin.

311
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,112
Let's pretend we’re dead.

312
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,635
No, thanks...

313
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,196
What do you think happens
when someone dies?

314
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:22,229
Does he go to paradise,
to God and Jesus and all of that?

315
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,470
I don’t know...

316
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:32,477
I believe that.
I think you become an angel in heaven.

317
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:39,470
You can play basketball all daylong
and score as many points as you like.

318
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:43,189
And be a million times better
than Michael Jordan.

319
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,314
That's bullshit...

320
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,149
That's not the only thing
you can do there.

321
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,550
You can do what you like in paradise.

322
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:58,077
Dance, play computer games,
go to parties...

323
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:02,677
That's stupid. I'm not going to die,
I'm going to America.

324
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,313
I'd play basketball.

325
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,317
- Cut it out.
- What are you doing?

326
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,117
- I feel sick...
- Where you going?

327
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,395
Stop it...

328
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,829
I don’t want to be here anymore.
I'm tired of this...

329
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,509
SUMMONS TO SOCIALWELFARE

330
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:50,516
So you've had no contact with your
mother since she moved to America?

331
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:54,195
- No.
- And she hasn't called?

332
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,516
I don’t have a telephone.

333
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,877
- She hasn’t written?
- No.

334
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,711
We've received a letter from her.
Do you know anything about this?

335
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,916
No. Why?

336
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,355
In the letter she writes...

337
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,639
Of course it's not legally binding.

338
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,189
You can’t formally do this...

339
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:22,717
But she writes
that she renounces her parenthood.

340
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:29,596
This means that she no longer wishes
to be your guardian.

341
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,875
Guardian? What are you talking about?

342
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:38,239
Look, I really feel sorry for you,
but here she writes...

343
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,628
I can read it to you.

344
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,519
"Lilya has always been
an unwanted child"-

345
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:46,832
- "and therefore
I no longer wish to be her guardian."

346
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,276
"I hereby hand her over
to the care of the Social Services."

347
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,114
It's awful, I understand...

348
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,271
It's awful.

349
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,789
And cigarettes, please.

350
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,992
That'll be 160,40.

351
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,192
Thanks.

352
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,999
- Close your eyes.
- What?

353
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,309
Close your eyes.

354
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,234
- What for?
- Please, close your eyes.

355
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:34,756
- What you going to do?
- Nothing special, just do it.

356
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,668
What you going to do?
Are you going to hit me?

357
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:44,311
- Don’t be silly. Just close your eyes.
- You promise?

358
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,117
Lilya, where you going?

359
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:53,071
Keep them closed... Now you can look.

360
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:57,952
- There you are. For your birthday.
- Is it really for me?

361
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:02,878
- Take it!
- Really? You're kidding...

362
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,031
- You're jerking me around...
- No.

363
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:09,148
- It's mine? You're sure? Mine? Yeah?
- Yeah...

364
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,029
- Thanks...
- I promised you.

365
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:21,637
I never got anything as nice.

366
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:39,674
- Where'd you get the money?
- I found it on the street.

367
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:43,833
- No... really?
- Doesn’t matter. Mom sent money.

368
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,798
It's mine! Mine!

369
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,234
Try to take it if you can.

370
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,350
Hello.

371
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,712
- How you doing?
- Go to hell!

372
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,596
What happened?

373
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:50,035
You're freezing, it's cold...

374
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,073
- Where do you live? You want a lift?
- Go away!

375
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:58,876
Don’t be afraid, I won't touch you.
I'll just take you home.

376
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:02,430
You can’t walk around here at night,
it's a dangerous area.

377
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,393
Don’t be afraid, I won’t touch you.

378
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,750
I'm just a normal guy.

379
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,873
By the way, my name’s Andrei.

380
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,711
I'm Lilya.

381
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,034
Pleased to meet you.

382
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,672
- Help yourself.
- Thanks.

383
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:03,438
What were you doing so late
in such a dangerous neighbourhood?

384
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,599
- Doesn’t matter...
- Okay, doesn’t matter.

385
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:12,275
- How old are you?
- 16.

386
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:16,069
Then you're a big girl,
but it’s still dangerous.

387
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,549
I'd advise you not to walk there.

388
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:28,992
Well...
you going to get into my bed now?

389
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:32,675
What are you on about?
I'm not going to sleep with you.

390
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,074
Why'd you give me a lift?

391
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,913
- I just did.
- You think I'm stupid?

392
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:43,072
No, I don't. I just wanted to be nice.

393
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:46,553
I saw you and just wanted to help.

394
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,553
So you think I'm ugly?

395
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,992
I don't think you're ugly...

396
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,515
You're really pretty.

397
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:59,831
But I'm not going to sleep with you.

398
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,035
That wasn't why I...

399
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:09,915
Okay. Sorry... Thanks for the lift.

400
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,268
Take care...

401
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,634
Wait!

402
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,199
Wait...

403
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:35,388
I thought may be...
maybe we could meet sometime?

404
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:39,118
Just meet...

405
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:43,239
We could go somewhere... see a movie...
I don’t know. Butno funny stuff.

406
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,352
No funny stuff?

407
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:49,678
Exactly...
Just don't get any ideas.

408
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,189
Okay.

409
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,438
Great. Cool...

410
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,032
Hi.

411
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,836
What are you doing here?
Hell, you scared me!

412
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:17,116
- Sorry.
- What are you doing here?

413
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,996
Sorry, I scared you.

414
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:25,358
Could I... sleep over at your place?

415
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,871
Okay.

416
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,920
Sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you.

417
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:38,039
He just wants to sleep with you.

418
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,475
No he doesn't.

419
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,632
Course he wants to.

420
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:47,349
No he doesn't. He's nice.

421
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:49,790
Don’t believe it.

422
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,270
- You're just jealous.
- Not at all.

423
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:57,318
- Course you are.
- Not at all.

424
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,916
- But of course you are.
- No, I'm not.

425
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,517
He just wants to sleep with you.

426
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,558
He just wants to sleep with you.

427
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:29,595
Mom!

428
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:36,789
No!

429
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:38,915
Shit!

430
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:42,515
Shit!

431
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,631
- You want some more?
- Yes.

432
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,155
- Pie or ice-cream?
- Ice-cream.

433
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:51,357
Ice-cream? I'll get it.

434
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,796
- There you go.
- Thanks.

435
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:20,832
Total fucking shit!

436
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:27,437
Now I can understand
why my mother left.

437
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:30,714
There's nothing to do here.

438
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,470
- Let's go to Sweden.
- What?

439
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:46,952
We take our things and go... now!
Don’t you believe me?

440
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:52,279
- You're kidding.
- Of course I am. Not now. In a week.

441
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:57,750
I live in Sweden, I work there.
I'm only here on holiday.

442
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:01,476
I leave in a week.
You can come with me.

443
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:07,474
I can get a job and a flat
for you there.

444
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:12,031
It'd be cool... Haven’t you ever
thought of leaving here?

445
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:16,029
This country is shit.
There's nothing to do here.

446
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:21,874
Sweden is a paradise compared
to here. You can really relax there.

447
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:25,198
And the people...
Even the people are different.

448
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:29,118
They're kind, not like here.

449
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:33,351
Besides, you can earn
really good money.

450
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:38,476
You know, in one month you can earn
what a doctor makes here in a year.

451
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,714
- That can’t be true!
- Yes it is, really!

452
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:46,714
Look at it here... People are crazy!

453
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:49,519
You know what my cousin did?

454
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,236
He sold one of his kidneys
because he didn't have money.

455
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:57,954
Would you sell a kidney?

456
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:02,918
You don't deserve a life like that.

457
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:18,039
- What happened to the ball?
- Dad broke it.

458
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:22,188
- Broke it?
- Just punctured it.

459
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,638
- Why?
- With scissors.

460
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:31,590
- Why?
- I don’t know. He went crazy.

461
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:35,233
I'll fix it...

462
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:39,871
<i>Open up! It's the police!</i>

463
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,675
Is it really the police?

464
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:48,593
<i>Open or we'll break the door r down!</i>

465
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:55,557
- Hi there! How are things?
- What do you want?

466
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:57,751
- Come here!
- What do you want?

467
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:00,480
- Get out!
- Stop it!

468
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:46,232
I don't give a shit about them.
They're assholes.

469
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:49,074
I'm getting out of here soon anyway.

470
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,036
You want some glue?

471
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:06,072
- You know what?
- No.

472
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:09,073
I'm going to get you a job in Sweden.

473
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:14,710
Really, I swear.
I don’t want to leave you here alone.

474
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,915
I'll talk to Andrei.

475
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,994
I'm so glad you're coming to Sweden.

476
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:41,397
We'll get a really big flat...
with an enormous bathroom...

477
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,230
Everything you want.

478
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:02,716
There's something
I want to ask you.

479
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:09,549
I have a friend
and I wanted to ask you whether...

480
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:13,279
Later, later...
We'll talk about it later.

481
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:16,589
Later, later...

482
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:46,238
- You're stupid.
- I'm stupid?

483
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:48,277
- You're stupid.
- I'm stupid?

484
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:52,353
- Yes, you are!
- You can leave if I'm stupid.

485
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:56,713
- And why am I stupid?
- 'Cause that guy's tricking you.

486
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:59,872
- Tricking me?
- Yes, he really is...

487
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:03,197
- No way!
- Course he is.

488
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:05,920
In what way?

489
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:10,153
He talks about jobs in Sweden,
but he just wants to sleep with you.

490
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:14,308
- In reality, there'll be no job.
- Course there will be!

491
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:18,759
I promise I'll get you a job
in Sweden. I’ll talk to Andrei.

492
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:22,311
Haven’t you talked to him yet?

493
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:26,794
- I forgot.
- You said you'd talk to him.

494
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:29,997
Sorry, I forgot!
I’ll talk to him, I promise.

495
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:33,470
- Were you doing something else?
- Stop it, I’ll talk to him.

496
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:39,116
- What job is it?
- Something with vegetables.

497
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:43,353
- Vegetables?
- Picking them or something...

498
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:47,195
Picking? In winter?
Vegetables don't grow in winter.

499
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:49,715
So?
Maybe it's warmer in Sweden.

500
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:53,270
- You know where Sweden is?
- Roughly.

501
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:57,831
- Where?
- I don't know exactly...

502
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:01,996
...but somewhere in the EU...
or whatever it's called.

503
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:06,278
And you, what do you know?!

504
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:11,510
- You're just jealous.
- Of him? Jealous? No.

505
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:14,478
- You're jealous. Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not!

506
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:17,029
- Course you are.
- No...

507
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,952
- Yes.
- No.

508
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,990
Course I'm not.

509
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:47,148
- Is it for me?
- Yes, who else?

510
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:50,392
- What is it?
- Open it, you'll see.

511
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,870
A passport?

512
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:57,554
- Look at the last page.
- What's there?

513
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,954
Now your name is Katya.

514
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:06,311
- Why?
- There could be problems at the border.

515
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,869
You're not 18 yet.

516
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:12,517
It's so they won't ask
unnecessary questions.

517
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:18,350
By the way, I rang my boss.

518
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:21,956
He said you could start on Monday.

519
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:25,908
- Monday? This Monday?
- Yes, this Monday.

520
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:28,708
We go on Sunday.

521
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:41,716
I have... to ask you something.

522
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:45,873
Could you get a job for another person?

523
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:49,913
I don’t know.

524
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:54,471
It's for my friend,
a friend that means a lot to me.

525
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,756
I don't want him to be here alone.

526
01:05:56,920 --> 01:06:01,516
I'll ask... I'll look into it...

527
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:04,831
It's not entirely out of the question.

528
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:07,595
You're too good!

529
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,758
<i>- Hello?
- Hello, Natasha? This is Lilya.</i>

530
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:16,879
I'm moving
with my boyfriend to Sweden.

531
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:20,828
You'll be left in this shithole.
That's how it goes, sweetie.

532
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:23,994
We're going into a tunnel,
we might be cut off...

533
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:27,357
<i>I'm calling
from my boyfriend's mobile.</i>

534
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:53,553
Volodya! Volodya, please!

535
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,510
Bye, potato-hag!

536
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:45,628
- Hi.
- Hi.

537
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,116
Jump in.

538
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:54,999
Volodya! Volodya...

539
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:57,390
- Where are you going?
- I must say goodbye.

540
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:59,232
We're in a hurry.

541
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:19,952
Listen, there's something...
a little problem.

542
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:25,795
My grandmother's ill, and I have
to visit her before I go to Sweden.

543
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:30,791
- Aren't we going to Sweden, then?
- You go alone and I'll join you later.

544
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:36,349
I'm sorry, but it's my grandmother.
It might be the last time I see her.

545
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:38,997
- So, I'll fly alone?
- Yeah.

546
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:44,116
I talked to my boss, he'll meet you,
take you home and show you around.

547
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:58,988
- It's time to go.
- Yes.

548
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:05,479
- We'll see each other soon?
- I told you I'll be there in two days.

549
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:08,473
- Really?
- Really.

550
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:20,233
- It's time to go...
- Bye.

551
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:17,916
Getup. Getup, I said!

552
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,276
Look at him just lying here.

553
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:11,155
Jekatarina Menyova. Katya...

554
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:18,393
19th of June 1982.

555
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:09,030
Good morning.

556
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:28,228
- Hi!
- Hello.

557
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:31,155
Come in.

558
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,430
One hour.

559
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:56,677
Perhaps you want
to take off your jacket?

560
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:01,669
I'll help you.

561
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:41,271
Thanks.

562
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:54,599
...but deliver us from evil.

563
01:25:54,760 --> 01:26:02,553
For thine is the Kingdom, and the power,
and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.

564
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:06,398
I want to have a doll...

565
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:11,793
...pencils to draw with,
and a pink school bag.

566
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:17,911
Hello.

567
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:25,918
Hello.

568
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:30,871
Sorry...

569
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:38,073
- Sorry I just left you like that.
- It doesn't matter.

570
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:42,155
- I miss you.
- I miss you too.

571
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:45,638
You're my only friend.

572
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:51,871
- The ball? Is it fixed?
- Yeah.

573
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:58,359
- How are you?
- Good.

574
01:27:58,520 --> 01:28:01,592
I play basketball all day long.

575
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:06,115
- You want to play a bit?
- No.

576
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:11,034
- By the way, merry Christmas!
- Is it Christmas?

577
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:13,839
- Yes.
- I didn't know.

578
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,389
- I've got a Christmas present for you.
- Really?

579
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:18,710
- Yeah...
- What?

580
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:20,677
- Come.
- What? Where?

581
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:21,829
Look.

582
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:31,355
What's this?

583
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:44,475
It's your Christmas present.

584
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:48,157
- What is?
- All this. The whole world.

585
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:52,757
The houses, cars, streets, the wind...
it's all yours.

586
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:55,071
You can do what you like.

587
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:58,799
Sorry, but I'm not sure
it's a good present.

588
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:01,231
It's windy...

589
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:04,392
...there's a mist. It's so cold.

590
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:07,110
And this world isn't that good.

591
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:13,273
Now I’m jumping... and flying...

592
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:18,317
No, you can't...

593
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:20,948
Why not? It's up to me.

594
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:24,396
I've had it with this life.
It's complete shit.

595
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:27,358
- No, it's not.
- Course it is. It's shit.

596
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:30,956
- No, it's not.
- Course it is.

597
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:36,353
But it's the only one you've got.
This life is the only one you've got.

598
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:40,559
I don't want this life.
I'm not interested.

599
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:44,153
Look at me.

600
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:48,996
I killed myself and went to heaven
and yeah, it's really good in heaven.

601
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:54,234
But I regret it, 'cause I wanted to live
on earth a little longer.

602
01:29:55,120 --> 01:30:00,797
You remain dead for all eternity, but
you're alive only for a brief moment.

603
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:06,474
- I wasn't ready yet.
- Not ready?

604
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:10,792
Remember that time
when we sat on the bench -

605
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:12,951
- And you wrote "Lilya 4-ever"?

606
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:16,669
And those assholes
that spat at us?

607
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:19,912
I said that we should leave-

608
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:24,835
- But you said that you weren't ready.

609
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:29,630
You wanted to finish writing first.
Do you remember?

610
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:33,355
That's how it is now.

611
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:37,308
Everyone's spitting at you,
but you're not ready.

612
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:45,835
Jump if you want. It's not dangerous.
I'll catch you.

613
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:51,028
But then you lose. And the assholes
that spit at you win. You see?

614
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:55,114
Hello, sweetheart.
Are you back from school already?

615
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:58,754
Have you got homework?

616
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:01,758
How was school today?

617
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:06,348
I hate you.

618
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:12,191
You think I'm your property?

619
01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:14,920
I'm not your property.

620
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:19,358
You think you can buy me?

621
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:22,311
You can't.

622
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:26,274
You can't buy my heart and soul.

623
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:58,837
Stop! Stop god dammit!

624
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:30,117
Mom...

625
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,150
Mom...

626
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:45,676
Hello...

627
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:57,270
Poor little thing...

628
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:01,395
I've got a surprise for you.

629
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:04,120
I don't want anymore surprises.

630
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:08,159
- The door's open.
- What?

631
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:12,472
He forgot to lock it when he left.
The door's open.

632
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:15,957
Come on. Getup.

633
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:20,515
- I can't...
- Come on.

634
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:24,309
- I just want to sleep.
- The door's open.

635
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:34,791
You see? He forgot to lock the door.

636
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:36,269
Go!

637
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:39,628
Where shall I go?

638
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:55,035
Lilya, wait! Don't jump!

639
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:57,469
Don't jump! Don't do it! No!

640
01:38:57,640 --> 01:39:01,349
No, please Lilya! No! I beg you!

641
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:03,476
Lilya! No!

642
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:17,674
Girl, about 16 years old.
Fall from a height.

643
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:19,639
One, two, three...

644
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:24,032
General circulatory arrest.
No further details. Within five minutes.

645
01:40:05,160 --> 01:40:08,232
Can I touch you? Are you real?!

646
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:10,152
You're real!

647
01:40:13,480 --> 01:40:17,155
I'm not going. You don't pick vegetables
in the winter, I'm no fool.

648
01:40:17,320 --> 01:40:18,753
Bye!

649
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:24,079
You dropped your potatoes.
Let me help you.

650
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:34,955
This film is dedicated to the millions
of children around the world
exploited by the sex trade.
