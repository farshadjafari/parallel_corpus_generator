1
00:00:31,262 --> 00:00:34,484
Want to take a walk with me?

2
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,298
...continue to protest the presence
of a convicted sex offender

3
00:01:20,336 --> 00:01:22,599
in their neighborhood.
Michelle Betler reports.

4
00:01:22,638 --> 00:01:25,170
Thanks, Rick. l'm standing here
on Woodward Court,

5
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:26,973
the quiet residential street

6
00:01:27,011 --> 00:01:28,929
that has become the focus of controversy

7
00:01:28,967 --> 00:01:32,112
ever since 48-year-old
Ronald James McGorvey returned here

8
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,839
after serving a two-year prison sentence

9
00:01:33,878 --> 00:01:35,834
for indecent exposure to a minor.

10
00:01:35,873 --> 00:01:37,828
ln the past few days an organization

11
00:01:37,866 --> 00:01:39,939
known as the Committee of Concerned Parents

12
00:01:40,015 --> 00:01:43,009
began distributing these notices throughout the community

13
00:01:43,085 --> 00:01:45,271
warning neighbors of what they call a quote,

14
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,188
''Dangerous predator in our midst.''

15
00:01:47,265 --> 00:01:50,526
l don't really like having him that close to my family.

16
00:01:50,564 --> 00:01:53,979
l think it's outrageous. This block has too many children

17
00:01:54,018 --> 00:01:56,855
for a sex offender to, uh, be moving in the neighborhood.

18
00:01:56,894 --> 00:01:58,659
l... l don't think it's a good idea.

19
00:01:58,698 --> 00:02:01,114
Makes me very nervous. Makes me a little enraged.

20
00:02:01,152 --> 00:02:04,029
Um, l'd have a problem if l see him on the street.

21
00:02:04,067 --> 00:02:06,254
lt's like having an alcoholic work in a bar.

22
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,441
They don't mix. They shouldn't be together.

23
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,548
The conditions of his parole expressly forbid McGorvey

24
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:13,658
to be within 100 yards of any playground,

25
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:17,111
school or recreation area where children normally gather.

26
00:02:17,188 --> 00:02:19,105
These conditions seem to be of little comfort

27
00:02:19,182 --> 00:02:21,637
to the many parents whose children play and go to school

28
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:23,555
in this formerly tranquil community,

29
00:02:23,593 --> 00:02:26,740
and who in the coming days and weeks will be hoping for the best

30
00:02:26,778 --> 00:02:29,463
but preparing for the worst. Rick, back to you.

31
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:42,888
My husband and l had an actual spiritual experience.

32
00:02:42,773 --> 00:02:45,880
We did this intense spa treatment...

33
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,646
- Oh, come on.
- No, listen to me.

34
00:02:47,531 --> 00:02:50,830
lt was on our vacation in Cabo and there were eight other couples

35
00:02:50,868 --> 00:02:52,977
and this Mayan woman.

36
00:02:53,016 --> 00:02:55,049
A goddess, just a goddess.

37
00:02:55,087 --> 00:02:56,353
- She had... She's due in September.

38
00:02:56,392 --> 00:02:58,963
She thinks she's gonna take three months off,

39
00:02:59,001 --> 00:03:01,455
then it's Christmas, then she'll be back to work the first of the year.

40
00:03:01,494 --> 00:03:02,913
Please.

41
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:05,790
Six months from now she'll be right here on this bench with us.

42
00:03:05,829 --> 00:03:07,823
My friend Beth said that the way she did it

43
00:03:07,669 --> 00:03:10,931
was to just take him with her every time she went to the bathroom.

44
00:03:10,969 --> 00:03:13,923
- l find that strange.
- Yeah, that's what l said to Beth.

45
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:15,419
lt's Oedipal.

46
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:17,336
What's the rush?

47
00:03:17,374 --> 00:03:20,137
Although l will say, when l was trying to potty-train Christian,

48
00:03:20,214 --> 00:03:23,054
l opened the diaper and it was huge!

49
00:03:23,092 --> 00:03:24,741
Like a grown man.

50
00:03:24,779 --> 00:03:28,193
Smiling politely to mask a familiar feeling of desperation

51
00:03:28,232 --> 00:03:31,953
Sarah reminded herself to think like an anthropologist.

52
00:03:31,991 --> 00:03:35,865
She was a researcher studying the behavior of typical suburban women.

53
00:03:35,903 --> 00:03:37,515
They weren't organic?

54
00:03:37,554 --> 00:03:40,431
She was not a typical suburban woman herself.

55
00:03:40,277 --> 00:03:42,464
Troy, stop that!

56
00:03:42,502 --> 00:03:43,998
Paul and l were having sex the other night

57
00:03:44,037 --> 00:03:46,107
and l drifted off right in the middle of it.

58
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,873
lt happens.

59
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,942
Yeah, l guess. But when l woke up and apologized

60
00:03:50,827 --> 00:03:52,745
he said he hadn't even noticed.

61
00:03:52,783 --> 00:03:54,393
You know what you should do?

62
00:03:54,432 --> 00:03:56,926
Set aside a specific block of time for it.

63
00:03:56,965 --> 00:03:59,610
That's what Louis and l do...
every Tuesday night at 9:00.

64
00:03:59,649 --> 00:04:01,606
''Whether you want to or not'' Sarah thought,

65
00:04:01,645 --> 00:04:03,984
her eyes straying over to the play area.

66
00:04:05,366 --> 00:04:08,165
Even at such a tiny playground as this

67
00:04:08,203 --> 00:04:11,119
Lucy didn't interact much with the other children.

68
00:04:11,157 --> 00:04:13,651
Sarah didn't really know why they even bothered coming here,

69
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:15,685
except that she'd probably go crazy

70
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:17,334
trapped in the house all day

71
00:04:17,372 --> 00:04:19,481
with this unknowable little person.

72
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,190
Morning snack time was 10:30 on the dot...

73
00:04:28,228 --> 00:04:30,223
Snack time!

74
00:04:30,261 --> 00:04:32,947
...a regimen established and maintained by Mary Ann,

75
00:04:32,985 --> 00:04:35,517
who believed that rigid adherence to a timetable

76
00:04:35,555 --> 00:04:37,358
was not only the key to a healthy marriage,

77
00:04:37,397 --> 00:04:39,391
but to effective parenting as well.

78
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,846
- l'll take this one!
- l want that one!

79
00:04:43,957 --> 00:04:47,064
- Can l do it?
- Yeah. Ready?

80
00:04:49,864 --> 00:04:52,318
Mommy...

81
00:04:52,395 --> 00:04:54,276
where's my snack?

82
00:04:54,352 --> 00:04:56,693
l'm sorry, honey, Mommy can't find it.

83
00:04:56,731 --> 00:04:58,956
- l forgot the rice cakes.
- Poor thing.

84
00:04:58,994 --> 00:05:00,988
- l'm sure it's in here somewhere.
- Second time this week.

85
00:05:00,835 --> 00:05:02,830
Well, who's going to keep track of everything?

86
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:04,902
- Bad mommy. Bad mommy.
- Just calm down, please.

87
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,508
No calm down! l want my snack!

88
00:05:08,546 --> 00:05:10,885
All right, you know what? lt's...

89
00:05:10,924 --> 00:05:13,647
it's just not here, okay? See for yourself.

90
00:05:16,947 --> 00:05:18,482
Wait!

91
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,320
Troy, honey, give Lucy your goldfish.

92
00:05:21,358 --> 00:05:23,008
No!

93
00:05:23,084 --> 00:05:24,887
Troy Jonathan, give me those goldfish!

94
00:05:24,964 --> 00:05:26,269
But, Mama, they're mine.

95
00:05:26,308 --> 00:05:28,800
No back talk. You can share with your sister.

96
00:05:28,685 --> 00:05:30,872
Troy has goldfish for you. Go sit down.

97
00:05:30,911 --> 00:05:32,982
That's much more than 10.

98
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,474
- That's great.
- Look how big l made my lawn.

99
00:05:35,512 --> 00:05:37,815
Thank you, Mary Ann, you're a life saver.

100
00:05:37,854 --> 00:05:41,114
lt's nothing. l just hate to see her suffer like that.

101
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:45,026
Maybe you should make a checklist and tape it to the door

102
00:05:45,065 --> 00:05:47,559
so it's the last thing you see before leaving the house.

103
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,669
That's what l do.

104
00:05:49,707 --> 00:05:53,274
Yeah, thank you. That's... that's a really helpful suggestion.

105
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,343
You're welcome.

106
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,530
Drink your juice.

107
00:05:58,415 --> 00:06:00,333
Are you the plane again?

108
00:06:00,372 --> 00:06:01,484
Look.

109
00:06:01,523 --> 00:06:03,977
Now you have to act like me.

110
00:06:04,015 --> 00:06:06,202
The prom king.

111
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,770
Oh my God, he's back.

112
00:06:09,809 --> 00:06:11,497
Sarah followed the other women's gazes

113
00:06:11,535 --> 00:06:12,762
over to the entrance of the playground,

114
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,946
eager to finally get a glimpse of the prom king,

115
00:06:15,984 --> 00:06:18,517
the handsome and mysterious young father

116
00:06:18,555 --> 00:06:20,512
who had been a regular at the Walker Street playground

117
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:23,235
for several weeks this past spring

118
00:06:23,274 --> 00:06:26,227
before abruptly dropping out of sight.

119
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:29,795
l don't need a rest. l need an airplane ride.

120
00:06:29,872 --> 00:06:32,749
His departure had left a gaping hole in the emotional lives

121
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:35,050
of Cheryl, Theresa and Mary Ann.

122
00:06:35,088 --> 00:06:38,080
Barely a day went by without one of them speculating wistfully

123
00:06:38,119 --> 00:06:41,648
about the reason for his absence and the likelihood of his return.

124
00:06:43,489 --> 00:06:47,402
Here l come. There's no room for two of us, diesel.

125
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,856
You've done it again.

126
00:06:49,895 --> 00:06:51,392
l hate steam engines.

127
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:54,230
When l come back l will pinch you with my pinchers.

128
00:06:54,269 --> 00:06:57,798
Yeah? Well, when l come back

129
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,408
l'm gonna ram you with my rammer.

130
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:01,290
- Ready? - No, you won't.

131
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:07,926
Every time you win, diesel!

132
00:07:07,964 --> 00:07:10,726
l know.

133
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,296
- Hello! - Mommy's home.

134
00:07:13,335 --> 00:07:16,135
The jester's cap was something that truly disturbed Brad.

135
00:07:16,173 --> 00:07:19,395
All day long the boy ate, played and napped in it.

136
00:07:19,433 --> 00:07:23,270
But the moment his mother stepped in the house he had no more use for it.

137
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:25,687
As if the entire day up to that point

138
00:07:25,725 --> 00:07:28,525
had been a pointless and somewhat useless charade.

139
00:07:28,563 --> 00:07:30,443
You got some sun today, didn't you?

140
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,243
Did Daddy forget the sunscreen again?

141
00:07:34,932 --> 00:07:37,501
What are you doing?

142
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,916
That's his full name. What's your favorite thing about him?

143
00:07:40,992 --> 00:07:43,294
Um...

144
00:07:43,332 --> 00:07:45,673
l like to come over to his house.

145
00:07:45,712 --> 00:07:46,977
Hmm.

146
00:07:49,854 --> 00:07:53,267
l think l'm gonna finally break down and get a cell phone.

147
00:07:53,305 --> 00:07:55,416
- Really?
- Mmm.

148
00:07:55,455 --> 00:07:56,721
Why?

149
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,052
l have no way of reaching you when l'm out with Aaron.

150
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:03,242
You're done, right?

151
00:08:05,467 --> 00:08:07,500
You've got one.

152
00:08:07,577 --> 00:08:09,418
Don't you think it's strange that l don't?

153
00:08:09,457 --> 00:08:13,139
Yeah, l do. You just never wanted one before.

154
00:08:13,178 --> 00:08:15,441
Yeah, l know.

155
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:18,817
There's a family plan. We can talk for free.

156
00:08:20,657 --> 00:08:22,308
Okay.

157
00:08:22,346 --> 00:08:24,954
Let's just see where we are at the end of the month.

158
00:08:24,992 --> 00:08:26,450
Yeah?

159
00:08:26,488 --> 00:08:29,595
Are your hands okay?

160
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,359
As was her custom each week night after dinner,

161
00:08:46,398 --> 00:08:49,620
the boy's mother sent Brad down to the municipal library

162
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:52,651
to study for the bar exam.

163
00:08:52,689 --> 00:08:55,950
But he never quite made it through the door of the building.

164
00:08:58,558 --> 00:09:01,819
Brad had been watching the skateboarders for weeks now,

165
00:09:01,858 --> 00:09:04,388
sometimes for as long as an hour at a stretch.

166
00:09:04,427 --> 00:09:07,304
But he never received the slightest acknowledgement from any of them.

167
00:09:08,993 --> 00:09:12,752
He'd been the same age as these boys when his mother died.

168
00:09:12,829 --> 00:09:14,862
- You do that!
- No way!

169
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,933
- Nice.
- Hey, that was nice, dude!

170
00:09:16,971 --> 00:09:19,581
''l must have been like this,'' Brad sometimes thought.

171
00:09:19,619 --> 00:09:23,684
''l must have been one of them.''

172
00:09:26,945 --> 00:09:28,326
Awful.

173
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,277
He should be castrated.

174
00:09:32,316 --> 00:09:34,120
Quick and clean, just chop it off.

175
00:09:34,158 --> 00:09:36,190
Then you wouldn't have to worry about notifying the neighbors.

176
00:09:36,229 --> 00:09:37,993
You know what else you should do?

177
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,986
Nail his penis above the entrance to the elementary school.

178
00:09:41,063 --> 00:09:43,748
You know, as a warning to other perverts.

179
00:09:43,825 --> 00:09:45,512
You think this is funny?

180
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:48,888
l just can't believe you want to castrate a man for indecent exposure.

181
00:09:48,926 --> 00:09:51,612
My brother used to expose himself when--

182
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:54,067
when we were teenagers. He'd do it in my bedroom,

183
00:09:54,105 --> 00:09:56,483
he'd do it in the dining room, he'd do it in the back seat of a car.

184
00:09:56,522 --> 00:09:59,898
He'd always figure out a way to do it so that nobody could see him except me.

185
00:09:59,936 --> 00:10:02,085
Didn't you tell anyone?

186
00:10:02,124 --> 00:10:04,002
No, l didn't want to get him in trouble.

187
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,844
Maybe he should be castrated.

188
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:10,293
lt's not the same thing. He wasn't doing it to strangers.

189
00:10:10,369 --> 00:10:12,941
Oh my God, there he is.

190
00:10:13,017 --> 00:10:15,434
After all this time, two days in a row.

191
00:10:15,511 --> 00:10:17,007
Where's the fire?

192
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:19,576
Maybe he needed a vacation.

193
00:10:19,614 --> 00:10:22,033
From what?

194
00:10:22,071 --> 00:10:24,181
From being the prom king.

195
00:10:24,027 --> 00:10:26,405
lt's a dirty job, but someone's gotta do it.

196
00:10:29,857 --> 00:10:32,005
- Close it?
- Close it.

197
00:10:32,044 --> 00:10:35,229
Close the gate. There you go.

198
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:37,645
- lt's open.
- lt's all right.

199
00:10:37,683 --> 00:10:40,714
- Somebody else will close it.
- Are we practicing?

200
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,433
Are we playing up on the swings?

201
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,465
Swing time!

202
00:10:52,222 --> 00:10:53,948
What's he do for a living?

203
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:57,708
We've never actually spoken to him.

204
00:10:57,746 --> 00:10:58,935
Really?

205
00:10:58,974 --> 00:11:01,352
We don't even know his name.

206
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:04,422
l thought you guys said he was a regular here.

207
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,454
- lt was awkward.
- He made us nervous.

208
00:11:06,492 --> 00:11:09,600
You had to think about what you were gonna wear in the morning.

209
00:11:09,638 --> 00:11:12,131
You know, put on makeup. lt was exhausting.

210
00:11:21,108 --> 00:11:23,448
Mommy, push me!

211
00:11:23,487 --> 00:11:26,939
Okay. l'll be right there.

212
00:11:30,008 --> 00:11:33,115
Wait!

213
00:11:33,154 --> 00:11:35,339
Five bucks if you get his phone number.

214
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:44,316
How old is she?

215
00:11:44,354 --> 00:11:45,697
Lucy,

216
00:11:45,735 --> 00:11:48,498
tell the nice boy how old you are.

217
00:11:48,537 --> 00:11:50,952
l'm three.

218
00:11:50,991 --> 00:11:53,254
My grandma lives in New Jersey.

219
00:11:53,293 --> 00:11:56,246
She doesn't have a swim pool.

220
00:11:56,093 --> 00:11:57,705
Do you like to swim?

221
00:11:57,743 --> 00:12:01,004
l don't like sharks. They eat you up.

222
00:12:01,043 --> 00:12:02,960
Don't listen to him.

223
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:06,105
We go to the town pool almost every day.

224
00:12:06,144 --> 00:12:09,673
- l'm Brad, by the way.
- Sarah.

225
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,821
You guys come here a lot?

226
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,315
No, just the last few weeks.

227
00:12:14,353 --> 00:12:16,540
l usually go to the one over on Harris,

228
00:12:16,578 --> 00:12:18,841
with the big wood things, you know, and the slide across.

229
00:12:18,918 --> 00:12:20,454
Yeah, we actually rent a house right around the corner

230
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,025
from there on Ashforth.

231
00:12:22,064 --> 00:12:24,902
That ice cream truck never leaves. Such a nightmare.

232
00:12:24,979 --> 00:12:28,431
Yeah, tell me about it.

233
00:12:28,469 --> 00:12:31,079
You know, you're the first person here who's ever talked to me.

234
00:12:32,843 --> 00:12:36,027
You make 'em nervous.

235
00:12:36,066 --> 00:12:38,481
Oh, right.

236
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,782
l guess they don't see too many fathers here during the weekdays.

237
00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:46,998
You don't have to be polite. Go ahead and ask.

238
00:12:47,036 --> 00:12:48,993
What?

239
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,947
You know, what the person who wears the pants in the family does for a living.

240
00:12:52,024 --> 00:12:55,322
Oh. All right, what does your wife do?

241
00:12:55,361 --> 00:12:58,545
- She makes documentaries.
- Oh, wow.

242
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:01,346
- Like Michael Moore?
- Uh, like PBS.

243
00:13:01,384 --> 00:13:03,993
Oh.

244
00:13:04,031 --> 00:13:05,987
Well, l think it's admirable you're here.

245
00:13:06,025 --> 00:13:08,710
There's no reason fathers can't be primary caregivers.

246
00:13:11,049 --> 00:13:12,816
l finished law school two years ago,

247
00:13:12,854 --> 00:13:16,114
but l can't seem to pass the bar exam. Failed it twice now.

248
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:20,640
Maybe you just don't want to be a lawyer.

249
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:25,129
l'll take the test one more time.

250
00:13:25,206 --> 00:13:26,702
lf l mess up now

251
00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:30,806
l'll just have to find something else to do with my life.

252
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:33,223
- Right, buddy? - Right.

253
00:13:33,262 --> 00:13:36,446
Sarah was shocked by how Brad delivered this confession,

254
00:13:36,484 --> 00:13:40,012
with no apparent sense of being in the least bit embarrassed by his failure.

255
00:13:40,051 --> 00:13:42,544
Most men weren't like this.

256
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:45,576
Her husband Richard certainly wasn't.

257
00:13:45,422 --> 00:13:48,146
She wondered if Brad was always this forthcoming.

258
00:13:48,185 --> 00:13:50,908
lf anything, he seemed a little lonely,

259
00:13:50,947 --> 00:13:54,284
all too ready to open his heart at the slightest sign of interest,

260
00:13:54,361 --> 00:13:56,893
like a lot of young mothers she knew.

261
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:59,385
l couldn't help noticing your stroller.

262
00:13:59,462 --> 00:14:01,687
Do you have another child?

263
00:14:01,725 --> 00:14:04,411
No, just Aaron. Got that at a yard sale.

264
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:07,633
Extra seat comes in handy for the bear, though.

265
00:14:07,671 --> 00:14:10,702
Lucy refuses to go in a stroller or a car seat.

266
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,078
We have to walk everywhere. lt takes us half an hour to go three blocks,

267
00:14:14,116 --> 00:14:15,728
unless l carry her.

268
00:14:15,767 --> 00:14:19,296
- Daddy, l'm finished.
- Are you sure? We just got here.

269
00:14:19,334 --> 00:14:21,903
l'm finished right now.

270
00:14:21,942 --> 00:14:24,435
Okay. All right, here we go.

271
00:14:24,474 --> 00:14:27,427
Ready? One, two, three.

272
00:14:27,504 --> 00:14:29,115
- Oops.
- Oh, hold on for a second.

273
00:14:29,192 --> 00:14:30,535
- There, thank you.
- Are you okay?

274
00:14:30,573 --> 00:14:32,337
No problem.

275
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:35,406
lt was then while watching Brad kneel down at his son's feet

276
00:14:35,444 --> 00:14:40,010
that Sarah found herself gripped by an unexpected pang of sadness.

277
00:14:40,048 --> 00:14:42,964
''Don't go,'' she thought.

278
00:14:43,002 --> 00:14:46,492
''Don't leave me here with the others.''

279
00:14:46,531 --> 00:14:50,176
- lt was nice talking to you.
- Same here.

280
00:14:50,214 --> 00:14:53,322
Wait! Um...

281
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,200
Come here. Just...

282
00:14:55,239 --> 00:14:57,273
come here.

283
00:14:59,383 --> 00:15:01,261
You see those women over there?

284
00:15:01,338 --> 00:15:03,142
Just, yeah, don't... don't look.

285
00:15:03,219 --> 00:15:05,980
You know what they call you?

286
00:15:06,018 --> 00:15:07,399
What?

287
00:15:07,438 --> 00:15:09,701
The prom king.

288
00:15:09,739 --> 00:15:11,275
Oh God, really?

289
00:15:11,313 --> 00:15:13,806
Yeah, they mean it as a compliment.

290
00:15:13,652 --> 00:15:16,069
You're a big character in their fantasy lives.

291
00:15:16,107 --> 00:15:17,642
Wow.

292
00:15:17,488 --> 00:15:20,712
Um, so one of them bet me $5 l couldn't get your phone number.

293
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,358
Five bucks, huh?

294
00:15:23,396 --> 00:15:25,199
Yeah.

295
00:15:25,238 --> 00:15:27,616
Could we split it 50-50?

296
00:15:27,654 --> 00:15:29,649
lt could be arranged.

297
00:15:29,687 --> 00:15:30,993
lt doesn't have to be your real number.

298
00:15:31,069 --> 00:15:33,677
Oh, well, you know, in that case, sure. You got a pen?

299
00:15:33,754 --> 00:15:36,746
Great. Oh shit, no l-- um, no l don't.

300
00:15:36,784 --> 00:15:38,625
- Uh... - Well...

301
00:15:38,663 --> 00:15:40,660
No wait, just-- wait.

302
00:15:40,698 --> 00:15:43,919
You know what'd really be funny?

303
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:46,873
lf you gave me a hug.

304
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:50,173
- You think? - Yeah.

305
00:15:50,212 --> 00:15:52,436
- Yeah. - All right, come here.

306
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:55,965
Oh my God.

307
00:15:57,345 --> 00:16:00,567
Do you want to really freak them out?

308
00:16:00,606 --> 00:16:01,873
Yeah.

309
00:16:01,911 --> 00:16:03,829
Who's gonna talk in there?

310
00:16:05,824 --> 00:16:06,897
- Oh my God! - Troy!

311
00:16:06,974 --> 00:16:08,356
- Lucy! - lsabelle!

312
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:11,232
lsabelle! Come here, lsabelle. Okay, we have to go.

313
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,036
- lsabelle! - Troy!

314
00:16:13,074 --> 00:16:16,065
- l think that worked. - Yeah, l think so.

315
00:16:16,104 --> 00:16:19,556
- Um, well, it was nice meeting you. - Yeah.

316
00:16:19,595 --> 00:16:21,896
lt's okay, yeah. We're gonna go.

317
00:16:21,935 --> 00:16:24,007
- lt's all right. - Lucy?

318
00:16:24,046 --> 00:16:25,848
We're gonna go home.

319
00:16:25,886 --> 00:16:28,341
Okay, here we go, good girl.

320
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,106
Good girl.

321
00:16:32,446 --> 00:16:34,748
l'm sure your daughter found that very educational.

322
00:16:34,824 --> 00:16:36,129
His name is Brad. He's a lawyer

323
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:38,852
and he's really very nice.

324
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:44,722
For the past few days Sarah hadn't been able

325
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,215
to concentrate on anything but the prom king

326
00:16:47,253 --> 00:16:49,248
and the curious thing that had happened

327
00:16:49,287 --> 00:16:51,128
between them on the playground.

328
00:16:52,586 --> 00:16:55,079
She didn't feel shame or guilt,

329
00:16:55,118 --> 00:16:58,417
only a sense of profound disorientation,

330
00:16:58,455 --> 00:17:00,642
as if she had been kidnapped by aliens

331
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,978
then released unharmed a few hours later.

332
00:17:19,861 --> 00:17:22,123
As he had so often in recent days,

333
00:17:22,162 --> 00:17:25,769
Brad mentally reenacted the kiss by the swing set.

334
00:17:25,807 --> 00:17:28,069
He still couldn't believe it had really happened.

335
00:17:28,108 --> 00:17:29,912
And with all those women and children watching.

336
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,061
Troy! Troy!

337
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,054
Aaron had been particularly curious about what he'd seen.

338
00:17:34,092 --> 00:17:35,780
Why you hugging that lady?

339
00:17:35,818 --> 00:17:38,005
Well, that's what l'm trying to show you with Bozo.

340
00:17:38,043 --> 00:17:41,611
Sometimes it's a game that adults play to show that they're friends.

341
00:17:41,688 --> 00:17:43,989
You say, ''Hi, l'm your friend.''

342
00:17:44,028 --> 00:17:45,255
Aaron was skeptical.

343
00:17:45,294 --> 00:17:48,018
They returned to the playground the following morning,

344
00:17:48,057 --> 00:17:50,741
but no one was there.

345
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:53,234
Sarah hadn't shown up at the town pool either,

346
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:55,306
though Brad remembered telling her that he and Aaron

347
00:17:55,344 --> 00:17:57,647
could be found there most afternoons.

348
00:17:57,685 --> 00:18:00,677
lt didn't seem to matter that Sarah wasn't his type,

349
00:18:00,715 --> 00:18:04,628
wasn't even that pretty-- at least not compared to Kathy,

350
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:09,193
who had long legs and lustrous hair

351
00:18:09,231 --> 00:18:11,225
and perfect breasts.

352
00:18:11,302 --> 00:18:14,793
Sarah was short, boyish,

353
00:18:14,869 --> 00:18:17,670
and had eyebrows that were thicker than Brad thought necessary.

354
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,539
But even so, she'd walked into his arms that day

355
00:18:23,577 --> 00:18:25,572
as if she were fulfilling a secret wish

356
00:18:25,611 --> 00:18:29,448
he hadn't remembered making.

357
00:18:29,294 --> 00:18:31,212
Hey, pervert!

358
00:18:31,251 --> 00:18:33,206
Yeah, you, you pervert!

359
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:35,777
You like little boys, do you?

360
00:18:35,816 --> 00:18:38,232
- Larry? - Yes, it's fucking Larry!

361
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,958
Jesus, man, don't even joke about that.

362
00:18:39,996 --> 00:18:41,877
What are you doing? Are you busy?

363
00:18:41,915 --> 00:18:45,981
Uh, actually l'm supposed to be studying.

364
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:48,359
Taking the bar exam next month.

365
00:18:48,397 --> 00:18:50,508
l thought you did that last year.

366
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:53,423
Yeah. See how well l did?

367
00:18:53,269 --> 00:18:57,451
l got a better idea. Get in.

368
00:18:57,489 --> 00:19:00,136
Come on. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

369
00:19:02,246 --> 00:19:05,008
Do you mind holding these? Try to keep them nice.

370
00:19:05,046 --> 00:19:07,769
Oh, uh...

371
00:19:07,807 --> 00:19:11,798
are you, uh, part of the committee?

372
00:19:13,332 --> 00:19:15,135
l am the committee.

373
00:19:16,707 --> 00:19:19,202
Wow.

374
00:19:19,278 --> 00:19:21,119
That's-- that's quite a commitment.

375
00:19:21,157 --> 00:19:23,805
Yeah.

376
00:19:23,844 --> 00:19:25,877
Aren't you full time on the force already?

377
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,517
Yeah, l'm-- l'm taking a little time off.

378
00:19:35,122 --> 00:19:38,535
You know what they should do to this bastard?

379
00:19:38,573 --> 00:19:41,029
Just castrate him. You know, pfft!

380
00:19:41,067 --> 00:19:44,520
Get it over with, right?

381
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,939
Yeah.

382
00:19:55,146 --> 00:19:56,566
You look good.

383
00:19:58,483 --> 00:20:01,399
You've been, uh, working out?

384
00:20:01,437 --> 00:20:05,005
Uh, just push-ups, crunches...

385
00:20:05,043 --> 00:20:06,502
a little light running.

386
00:20:09,032 --> 00:20:10,989
The guys are gonna love this.

387
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:14,479
What guys?

388
00:20:16,398 --> 00:20:19,696
Wow, this is something.

389
00:20:19,581 --> 00:20:22,611
Yeah, it's pretty, but doesn't have a lot of give.

390
00:20:22,496 --> 00:20:23,954
lt's like playing on cement.

391
00:20:23,993 --> 00:20:25,796
Hey, hold on a second.

392
00:20:25,835 --> 00:20:28,060
Duane, l've really gotta talk to you about the committee.

393
00:20:28,098 --> 00:20:30,285
l mean, it would mean a lot to have your support on this thing.

394
00:20:30,131 --> 00:20:33,314
l told you already, Larry, none of us are gonna get involved in that shit.

395
00:20:33,353 --> 00:20:36,806
We're here to play ball. lf that's your thing, fine, but leave us out of it.

396
00:20:36,845 --> 00:20:38,800
Okay okay, fine. l get it, l get it, l get it. Guys!

397
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:41,754
Bring it in!

398
00:20:41,792 --> 00:20:44,669
Come on, come on, hustle up!

399
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:48,429
l want you all to meet our new quarterback.

400
00:20:48,467 --> 00:20:51,344
- Quarterback? - Guy better not be a pussy.

401
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:52,725
He played in college.

402
00:20:52,802 --> 00:20:54,682
Uh, l'm a little behind the curve.

403
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:56,523
Who are you guys?

404
00:20:56,562 --> 00:20:58,289
- We're the Guardians! - We're cops.

405
00:20:58,327 --> 00:21:00,167
Welcome to the Tri-County touch football night league.

406
00:21:00,206 --> 00:21:02,968
Let's just work on some simple pass patterns.

407
00:21:05,461 --> 00:21:07,994
Brad waited for his good sense to kick in.

408
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:11,024
There were lots of excuses available to him.

409
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:14,515
But it felt so good to be standing here beneath the bright lights.

410
00:21:14,553 --> 00:21:17,046
And he was filled with a feeling similar to the one

411
00:21:17,085 --> 00:21:19,195
he'd had right before kissing Sarah,

412
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:20,959
like his world had cracked open

413
00:21:20,998 --> 00:21:24,297
to reveal a thrilling new possibility.

414
00:21:25,715 --> 00:21:28,631
Okay, just let me warm up a little.

415
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,627
All right! Let's go!

416
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:33,312
Set, hut!

417
00:21:38,528 --> 00:21:40,294
What the fuck?

418
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,943
That's a late hit!

419
00:21:41,982 --> 00:21:43,822
This ain't Pop Warner, ace.

420
00:21:45,933 --> 00:21:50,074
You fucking faggot. You call yourself a quarterback?

421
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:03,617
Oh, this isn't me.

422
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:08,373
What are you doing?

423
00:22:08,412 --> 00:22:09,908
What is that? What's that for?

424
00:22:11,903 --> 00:22:14,397
l want the scumbag to know l'm keeping an eye on him.

425
00:22:19,613 --> 00:22:22,797
Oh, shit. Oh, uh...

426
00:22:22,836 --> 00:22:25,713
l don't think we want to be here, Larry.

427
00:22:25,751 --> 00:22:28,628
lt's not a question of want.

428
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:34,306
Joanie thinks l'm obsessed with this creep.

429
00:22:34,344 --> 00:22:36,569
She thinks if l had a job, l wouldn't be driving past his house

430
00:22:36,608 --> 00:22:39,753
five, six times a day. But you know what?

431
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:42,937
l kinda think this is my job.

432
00:22:45,431 --> 00:22:48,116
There's a roll of duct tape in the glove compartment.

433
00:22:48,154 --> 00:22:51,337
Would you grab it for me?

434
00:22:58,664 --> 00:23:00,851
Honey?

435
00:23:03,536 --> 00:23:06,568
Hi!

436
00:23:06,606 --> 00:23:09,099
Where were you?

437
00:23:11,324 --> 00:23:13,012
Oh my God. What happened?

438
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:15,352
l-- l-- l joined this group.

439
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:17,500
The Committee for Concerned Parents.

440
00:23:17,538 --> 00:23:20,416
We're distributing flyers about that creep on Woodward Court.

441
00:23:20,454 --> 00:23:22,909
These guys play a little touch football after.

442
00:23:24,673 --> 00:23:26,094
This late?

443
00:23:26,132 --> 00:23:28,932
Uh, it's a night league.

444
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:32,423
So it's gonna be a regular thing?

445
00:23:32,499 --> 00:23:34,263
No no no no, just once a week,

446
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:37,141
after l'm done studying at the library.

447
00:23:37,218 --> 00:23:39,021
ls that okay?

448
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:41,860
Uh, who are the guys?

449
00:23:41,898 --> 00:23:43,930
You remember Larry Hedges?

450
00:23:43,969 --> 00:23:45,887
The guy from the Sprinkler Park with the twins?

451
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:48,879
lt's his organization.

452
00:23:48,917 --> 00:23:50,913
l thought you didn't like him.

453
00:23:52,562 --> 00:23:54,557
He's okay.

454
00:23:54,596 --> 00:23:57,780
This committee makes a lot of sense. l mean it's--

455
00:23:57,818 --> 00:24:00,005
it's pretty scary having a weirdo like that

456
00:24:00,043 --> 00:24:02,229
living right by the playground.

457
00:24:04,186 --> 00:24:07,254
Mmm. l know.

458
00:24:07,331 --> 00:24:09,173
l hate to even think about it.

459
00:24:12,241 --> 00:24:14,619
Guess you'd better take a shower.

460
00:24:14,658 --> 00:24:17,419
Brad showered quickly, sensing a rare opportunity

461
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:20,450
to have sex with his wife.

462
00:24:20,297 --> 00:24:22,368
''This is just what l need,'' he thought.

463
00:24:22,407 --> 00:24:25,476
''Something to take my mind off that kiss.''

464
00:24:25,514 --> 00:24:27,624
Please don't.

465
00:24:27,662 --> 00:24:29,275
Come on, Kathy, we've been through this before.

466
00:24:29,312 --> 00:24:30,961
He needs to start sleeping by himself.

467
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,764
l know. He looks so comfy.

468
00:24:32,803 --> 00:24:34,414
Well, he'll be just as comfy in his own bed.

469
00:24:34,491 --> 00:24:36,676
l just miss him so much.

470
00:24:36,715 --> 00:24:39,670
l'm getting a little tired waking up with his foot in my face.

471
00:24:39,746 --> 00:24:42,393
lt's a perfect foot.

472
00:24:42,432 --> 00:24:45,001
Look at him. Just look at him.

473
00:24:46,344 --> 00:24:47,610
He's a handsome devil.

474
00:24:47,649 --> 00:24:51,026
Mmm, he's perfect.

475
00:25:03,951 --> 00:25:05,372
Good night.

476
00:25:10,051 --> 00:25:11,510
Number 2 Hillcrest

477
00:25:11,586 --> 00:25:13,619
was an impressive piece of real estate.

478
00:25:13,695 --> 00:25:15,845
Even so, Sarah was ambivalent

479
00:25:15,883 --> 00:25:17,877
about the house she occupied.

480
00:25:17,915 --> 00:25:21,022
She wasn't involved with its purchase or design.

481
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,861
The place was a hand-me-down of sorts from Richard's mother.

482
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:27,467
And the furnishings were leftovers from his first marriage.

483
00:25:27,505 --> 00:25:29,347
By the time Sarah arrived here

484
00:25:29,385 --> 00:25:31,764
Richard wasn't all that interested in redecorating.

485
00:25:31,801 --> 00:25:34,757
And so she decided to leave it as it was,

486
00:25:34,795 --> 00:25:38,476
with the exception of a single room that she staked out for her own

487
00:25:38,553 --> 00:25:40,433
and gradually began to populate it

488
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:42,619
with the remnants of her former self.

489
00:25:48,221 --> 00:25:50,100
From the moment Lucy was born

490
00:25:50,139 --> 00:25:52,978
Sarah had refused to hire someone for child care.

491
00:25:53,016 --> 00:25:55,356
Read me a story?

492
00:25:55,394 --> 00:25:58,003
ln a minute, okay?

493
00:25:58,041 --> 00:26:00,457
- Can l sit on your lap? - l said in a minute!

494
00:26:00,495 --> 00:26:02,606
Go finish your program, go.

495
00:26:02,645 --> 00:26:05,560
She wasn't exactly sure why she had taken this stance.

496
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:08,783
The truth was she spent most afternoons marking time,

497
00:26:08,821 --> 00:26:12,350
waiting desperately for the moment when her husband returned from work

498
00:26:12,427 --> 00:26:15,074
and she could finally have a moment to herself.

499
00:26:15,112 --> 00:26:17,184
But even this was not something she could rely on.

500
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,641
You're ready to roll?

501
00:26:18,717 --> 00:26:20,559
Could you wait a few minutes?

502
00:26:20,597 --> 00:26:23,014
l'm sorry, Richard's barricaded in the upstairs office

503
00:26:23,052 --> 00:26:25,814
- finishing some stuff for work. - No problem.

504
00:26:25,852 --> 00:26:27,925
l've got a little surprise for someone anyway.

505
00:26:27,963 --> 00:26:30,149
She's a terror at night. l couldn't get her to nap again.

506
00:26:30,187 --> 00:26:33,141
- Oh, the poor thing. - Poor mom is more like it.

507
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,173
Hello.

508
00:26:35,212 --> 00:26:38,013
ls there a cute little girl in the house?

509
00:26:38,051 --> 00:26:40,508
Oh, my goodness!

510
00:26:40,546 --> 00:26:43,345
What--

511
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,647
what have l found?

512
00:26:45,685 --> 00:26:48,102
- A beanie. - Oh, a beanie.

513
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:49,675
Jean, you didn't need to to that.

514
00:26:49,752 --> 00:26:53,433
Oh, this little dog needed a girl to take care of him.

515
00:26:53,472 --> 00:26:56,120
And l know a little girl who needed a dog.

516
00:26:58,153 --> 00:27:00,033
Let me see.

517
00:27:00,071 --> 00:27:01,682
Sarah was beginning to get angry.

518
00:27:01,721 --> 00:27:04,291
Her evening fitness walk was the one thing

519
00:27:04,329 --> 00:27:07,282
she looked forward to all day, and Richard knew this.

520
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,154
But if there was one thing life had taught Richard,

521
00:27:12,192 --> 00:27:14,035
it was that it was ridiculous

522
00:27:14,073 --> 00:27:17,103
to be at war with your own desires.

523
00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:20,710
He could easily imagine what people would say if they could see him now--

524
00:27:20,594 --> 00:27:23,548
Exactly the same thing they'd say if someone had told them

525
00:27:23,587 --> 00:27:26,923
that Ray from next door was a transvestite,

526
00:27:26,962 --> 00:27:28,649
or that Ted from work

527
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:31,181
had anonymous gay sex at highway rest stops.

528
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:34,480
''But we want what we want,'' Richard thought,

529
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:36,514
''and there's not much we can do about it.''

530
00:27:38,086 --> 00:27:40,733
He had stumbled on the site 11 months ago

531
00:27:40,772 --> 00:27:43,764
while doing research for a consulting firm.

532
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:46,295
His office door was wide open.

533
00:27:46,371 --> 00:27:48,367
But he clicked on the link anyway.

534
00:27:56,192 --> 00:27:58,149
He was deeply engrossed in his discovery

535
00:27:58,188 --> 00:28:00,719
when Ted knocked on his door.

536
00:28:00,757 --> 00:28:02,446
l'm taking lunch orders. You want something?

537
00:28:02,484 --> 00:28:04,364
Casually, but with great haste

538
00:28:04,402 --> 00:28:07,318
Richard banished Slutty Kay from his screen...

539
00:28:07,356 --> 00:28:09,504
Uh, yeah, l'll have a chicken Caesar.

540
00:28:09,542 --> 00:28:12,689
...and reentered the flow of an ordinary day.

541
00:28:15,066 --> 00:28:17,330
lt wasn't until several months later

542
00:28:17,369 --> 00:28:20,705
that Richard gave the slightest thought to the site he had stumbled upon.

543
00:28:23,276 --> 00:28:25,041
Do you need me for anything else?

544
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:26,958
Uh, no no, you can head home.

545
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:28,723
l'm just gonna catch up on some e-mail.

546
00:28:28,761 --> 00:28:31,677
Well, don't stay to late. Your dinner will get cold.

547
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:43,415
Lately Slutty Kay had become a problem.

548
00:28:43,454 --> 00:28:45,411
He thought about her far to often,

549
00:28:45,449 --> 00:28:46,791
and spent hours studying

550
00:28:46,829 --> 00:28:49,822
the thousands of photographs available to him.

551
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,583
Some of Kay's practices struck him as bizarre,

552
00:28:52,659 --> 00:28:54,503
even off-putting.

553
00:28:54,541 --> 00:28:57,762
She had a thing about kitchen utensils,

554
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:00,141
spatulas, and dressing up like a little girl

555
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:01,751
and playing with balloons.

556
00:29:01,789 --> 00:29:04,552
But who was Richard to judge?

557
00:29:07,735 --> 00:29:09,731
Oh, that's it.

558
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:13,299
Though as close as Richard sometimes felt to Slutty Kay,

559
00:29:13,337 --> 00:29:15,562
as much as he believed that he knew her,

560
00:29:15,601 --> 00:29:18,171
he could never get past the uncomfortable fact

561
00:29:18,209 --> 00:29:22,237
that she existed for him solely as a digital image.

562
00:29:31,866 --> 00:29:34,128
The panties were an attempt to solve this problem.

563
00:29:34,167 --> 00:29:38,042
Maybe a sniff or two would hurry things along,

564
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,688
so he could get back downstairs to his real life,

565
00:29:40,726 --> 00:29:42,644
where his wife was waiting for him

566
00:29:42,683 --> 00:29:45,597
her impatience increasing by the minute.

567
00:29:45,636 --> 00:29:48,475
What are you doing?

568
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:42,987
Are you almost finished there? 'Cause l'd really like to go for my walk?

569
00:30:44,751 --> 00:30:47,820
- You could have knocked. - l did!

570
00:30:49,354 --> 00:30:51,963
We need to talk.

571
00:31:02,283 --> 00:31:04,162
You're awfully quiet this evening.

572
00:31:04,239 --> 00:31:07,423
- Everything okay? - What?

573
00:31:07,461 --> 00:31:09,723
Yeah.

574
00:31:09,762 --> 00:31:11,835
You'll have to walk without me tomorrow night.

575
00:31:11,874 --> 00:31:14,136
l've got a book group meeting.

576
00:31:14,174 --> 00:31:16,130
Okay.

577
00:31:16,169 --> 00:31:18,432
You're sure everything's all right?

578
00:31:19,429 --> 00:31:22,077
Yeah, sorry.

579
00:31:22,115 --> 00:31:25,336
l guess l'm just a little tired.

580
00:31:25,375 --> 00:31:27,179
So what are you reading?

581
00:31:27,217 --> 00:31:28,942
''Crime and Punishment.''

582
00:31:28,981 --> 00:31:31,935
Wow. That's pretty highbrow for a book group.

583
00:31:32,011 --> 00:31:35,733
Well, we have some very stimulating discussions.

584
00:31:35,772 --> 00:31:38,149
You should come next month. We're doing ''Madame Bovary.''

585
00:31:38,226 --> 00:31:40,299
You could be my little sister.

586
00:31:40,337 --> 00:31:41,755
Little sister?

587
00:31:41,794 --> 00:31:45,439
We're trying to get younger women involved.

588
00:31:45,286 --> 00:31:47,241
We call them our little sisters.

589
00:31:48,545 --> 00:31:50,962
l don't know, Jean.

590
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,416
l read ''Madame Bovary'' in grad school.

591
00:31:53,455 --> 00:31:55,950
lt's a pretty misogynist text.

592
00:31:55,988 --> 00:31:58,826
Well, that's an interesting perspective.

593
00:31:58,865 --> 00:32:01,703
- You should come. - Let me think about it.

594
00:32:01,742 --> 00:32:04,620
Oh, would you excuse me, Jean?

595
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:07,880
Someone's at my door. l'll call you, okay?

596
00:32:07,918 --> 00:32:09,682
Hi!

597
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:14,516
Hi!

598
00:32:17,892 --> 00:32:20,424
Wow, God,

599
00:32:20,462 --> 00:32:21,765
this is a surprise.

600
00:32:21,804 --> 00:32:23,761
l haven't seen you since--

601
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,370
l-- l hope you don't mind. Your husband said you'd be back any minute.

602
00:32:26,408 --> 00:32:27,866
Oh, no, not at all.

603
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,206
lt's good to see you.

604
00:32:30,244 --> 00:32:33,850
God, um, can l get you some tea or something?

605
00:32:33,888 --> 00:32:36,152
l can only stay a minute. l just came to warn you.

606
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,837
- You know that guy, the pervert? - Uh-huh.

607
00:32:38,914 --> 00:32:40,294
He's been riding his bike near the playground

608
00:32:40,371 --> 00:32:42,865
- checking out the kids. - Oh, God.

609
00:32:42,942 --> 00:32:45,435
Oh, God, do the police know?

610
00:32:45,473 --> 00:32:47,392
Nothing they can do. He's not breaking any laws.

611
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:50,537
l guess they're just waiting for him to kill someone.

612
00:32:50,575 --> 00:32:52,800
l just thought you should know.

613
00:32:52,838 --> 00:32:56,406
Thanks, that's nice of you.

614
00:32:56,252 --> 00:32:58,517
Let me get you some tea.

615
00:32:58,555 --> 00:33:02,083
l'm sorry. l-- l don't think it's a good idea.

616
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:06,879
l didn't mean to kiss him.

617
00:33:06,955 --> 00:33:09,871
l don't even know how it happened.

618
00:33:13,477 --> 00:33:16,316
l'd better go. Mike's gonna worry.

619
00:33:21,571 --> 00:33:23,949
You wanna talk?

620
00:33:23,987 --> 00:33:25,714
l'm tired.

621
00:34:55,518 --> 00:34:57,933
Hello.

622
00:34:57,972 --> 00:35:00,159
Hey.

623
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:03,803
No, he's still sleeping.

624
00:35:03,841 --> 00:35:06,796
Yeah, l'm, uh, l'm going through it right now.

625
00:35:09,942 --> 00:35:13,431
No, l guess l don't need them.

626
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,843
Okay.

627
00:35:19,302 --> 00:35:22,293
All right, bye.

628
00:36:23,671 --> 00:36:25,052
H-hi.

629
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:27,353
H-hello?

630
00:36:27,392 --> 00:36:30,385
Yes, l'd like to place an order.

631
00:36:30,423 --> 00:36:33,683
Pierce, Sarah, Mrs.

632
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:36,752
Um...

633
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:40,781
it's the red bathing suit on page 29.

634
00:36:40,819 --> 00:36:43,043
The hide-your-tummy halter neck.

635
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,415
Uh, l'm size...

636
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:53,438
10, eight? l mean, l think.

637
00:36:53,515 --> 00:36:55,511
E-eight.

638
00:37:35,828 --> 00:37:37,401
You want to go in the pool?

639
00:37:37,439 --> 00:37:39,127
You do?

640
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:45,226
One, two.

641
00:37:50,827 --> 00:37:53,703
Daddy, can l go in the pool now?

642
00:37:53,742 --> 00:37:55,623
ln a minute, okay?

643
00:37:55,662 --> 00:37:58,691
Okay.

644
00:37:58,768 --> 00:38:01,492
There you go.

645
00:38:08,549 --> 00:38:10,929
Mommy, l have to go pee-pee.

646
00:38:10,967 --> 00:38:13,229
Just go in the pool.

647
00:38:13,268 --> 00:38:16,606
Huh-uh, l want to go to the bathroom.

648
00:38:16,645 --> 00:38:18,485
Really?

649
00:38:18,523 --> 00:38:20,327
Okay, come on.

650
00:38:24,738 --> 00:38:26,197
Okay, ready?

651
00:38:26,273 --> 00:38:28,305
There.

652
00:38:56,078 --> 00:38:58,152
Swing down.

653
00:39:01,028 --> 00:39:03,905
Hey, l'm drumming it.

654
00:39:03,982 --> 00:39:05,208
Oh.

655
00:39:06,167 --> 00:39:09,007
Wow.

656
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:11,423
- lt's you. - Yeah, hey.

657
00:39:11,461 --> 00:39:14,262
- Hi! - Okay.

658
00:39:15,489 --> 00:39:17,944
l hope you don't mind. Lucy has sensitive skin.

659
00:39:17,983 --> 00:39:20,476
She's better off in the shade.

660
00:39:20,515 --> 00:39:23,086
Oh no, not at all.

661
00:39:23,124 --> 00:39:24,351
lt's nice to see you again.

662
00:39:24,389 --> 00:39:26,347
Yeah, you too.

663
00:39:28,762 --> 00:39:31,180
l'm sorry, would you get my back?

664
00:39:31,257 --> 00:39:34,248
Um... okay, sure.

665
00:39:34,325 --> 00:39:35,515
Thanks.

666
00:39:35,553 --> 00:39:37,125
Right.

667
00:39:37,202 --> 00:39:40,117
## Who is knocking on the door? ##

668
00:39:40,157 --> 00:39:41,538
- Thanks a lot. - ## Knocking on the door ##

669
00:39:41,576 --> 00:39:43,608
## Knocking on the door ##

670
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:46,217
- ## Who is knocking on the door? ## - lt's okay, just...

671
00:39:46,255 --> 00:39:48,709
## A way, hey hey. ##

672
00:39:48,748 --> 00:39:50,629
Lucy, say hi to the little boy from the playground.

673
00:39:50,668 --> 00:39:52,086
Hi.

674
00:39:52,125 --> 00:39:54,542
Hi.

675
00:39:54,388 --> 00:39:56,613
You remember him?

676
00:40:01,677 --> 00:40:03,633
The pool became a ritual.

677
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:06,203
l was trying to think. l just didn't know the way.

678
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,967
- Oh oh, okay. - l'm here, l'm here.

679
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:09,771
We have the creature and we have flower.

680
00:40:09,809 --> 00:40:10,806
Right.

681
00:40:10,844 --> 00:40:13,339
Day after day they sat together in the shade

682
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:15,295
getting to know each other.

683
00:40:16,369 --> 00:40:19,054
This needs mustard.

684
00:40:19,093 --> 00:40:21,317
- Mustard? - Yeah.

685
00:40:21,355 --> 00:40:23,159
Having little choice in the matter,

686
00:40:23,197 --> 00:40:24,924
Aaron and Lucy formed a fragile friendship.

687
00:40:30,984 --> 00:40:32,903
Aw, that's perfect.

688
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:35,779
Sometimes Brad and Sarah traded offspring.

689
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,533
Mama said, ''What Papa told you was right.

690
00:40:41,609 --> 00:40:44,565
lt's not a good idea to talk to strangers.''

691
00:40:44,603 --> 00:40:48,400
lt was the most fun Sarah had had in years.

692
00:41:01,481 --> 00:41:04,397
But there was always that longing to touch,

693
00:41:04,435 --> 00:41:07,734
to be touched by Brad.

694
00:41:07,811 --> 00:41:11,264
And, as badly as she wanted this,

695
00:41:11,148 --> 00:41:14,523
she wanted just as badly to hold on to the innocent public life

696
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,941
they'd made for themselves out in the open.

697
00:41:16,979 --> 00:41:19,625
So she accepted the trade--

698
00:41:19,664 --> 00:41:22,656
the melancholy handshake at 4:00

699
00:41:22,694 --> 00:41:25,495
in exchange for this little patch of grass,

700
00:41:25,533 --> 00:41:28,181
some sunscreen and companionship.

701
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:31,480
One more happy day at the pool.

702
00:41:33,244 --> 00:41:35,814
Okay, no pasta for dinner, okay?

703
00:41:35,852 --> 00:41:38,001
We eat way too much pasta around here.

704
00:41:38,039 --> 00:41:39,996
l thought you liked my pasta.

705
00:41:40,073 --> 00:41:42,604
No, l do. That's the problem.

706
00:41:42,681 --> 00:41:45,519
Pretty soon l can sell advertising space on my ass.

707
00:41:46,748 --> 00:41:48,090
No, that's okay. l've got to go.

708
00:41:48,166 --> 00:41:50,047
l've got a 9:00 at Taps.

709
00:41:50,086 --> 00:41:52,079
l thought you were already editing.

710
00:41:52,118 --> 00:41:54,880
Yeah, so did l. lt was just--

711
00:41:54,918 --> 00:41:58,218
there's something in this family's story that really got to me.

712
00:42:00,902 --> 00:42:02,897
The father was...

713
00:42:02,936 --> 00:42:05,928
K-l-L-L-E-D

714
00:42:05,774 --> 00:42:09,112
in a, um, mortar attack,

715
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:11,951
and, um, left behind a little boy.

716
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:16,822
l was talking to the mother the other day on the phone,

717
00:42:16,898 --> 00:42:20,467
and she was saying she didn't know what she was going to do next Christmas.

718
00:42:20,505 --> 00:42:21,810
Jeez, l bet.

719
00:42:21,848 --> 00:42:24,188
No, it wasn't like that. lt was more...

720
00:42:24,226 --> 00:42:27,065
she was wondering, should she keep this tradition with her son

721
00:42:27,103 --> 00:42:28,867
that began with the boy's father.

722
00:42:28,905 --> 00:42:31,553
And she was saying he had this knack

723
00:42:31,592 --> 00:42:34,161
for requesting odd Christmas gifts--

724
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:36,041
scuba gear one year

725
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,534
and rappelling gear the next.

726
00:42:38,573 --> 00:42:42,410
She said he wasn't afraid to try anything.

727
00:42:42,486 --> 00:42:45,094
Trying new things made him feel...

728
00:42:45,171 --> 00:42:48,010
more alive.

729
00:42:49,927 --> 00:42:52,958
l've got to go. See you later.

730
00:43:01,437 --> 00:43:04,467
Patch one of your best and then we'll patch both of them.

731
00:43:04,505 --> 00:43:06,346
Okay?

732
00:43:09,107 --> 00:43:11,333
Hey, l got something.

733
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:17,892
Hot enough for you?

734
00:43:17,969 --> 00:43:20,579
Yeah.

735
00:43:20,655 --> 00:43:23,456
Yeah, it's so humid.

736
00:43:23,494 --> 00:43:26,947
l've got football practice tonight.

737
00:43:26,985 --> 00:43:28,865
Be like playing in a sauna.

738
00:43:28,903 --> 00:43:32,163
Watch out for that ltalian guy.

739
00:43:32,201 --> 00:43:34,619
What's his name?

740
00:43:34,657 --> 00:43:36,077
Corrente?

741
00:43:35,923 --> 00:43:38,685
Yeah.

742
00:43:38,724 --> 00:43:40,948
Remember what happened to your knee last week?

743
00:43:40,986 --> 00:43:43,480
You should be careful, Brad.

744
00:43:46,126 --> 00:43:47,700
l'll be careful.

745
00:43:47,777 --> 00:43:50,346
Promise?

746
00:43:52,494 --> 00:43:56,062
Yeah. Yeah, l promise.

747
00:43:59,093 --> 00:44:01,548
Weatherman said scattered showers.

748
00:44:01,586 --> 00:44:03,504
l don't see scattered showers.

749
00:44:13,171 --> 00:44:15,895
Mom, could l please have some money for a snack?

750
00:44:15,934 --> 00:44:18,350
No, sweetheart. You guys just had a snack. No.

751
00:44:18,427 --> 00:44:19,923
Oh, okay.

752
00:44:19,961 --> 00:44:21,841
All they want is sugar.

753
00:44:21,879 --> 00:44:23,566
Constantly.

754
00:45:38,218 --> 00:45:40,136
Oh, no.

755
00:45:46,964 --> 00:45:49,380
lt's him.

756
00:45:50,494 --> 00:45:52,412
Oh, Jesus.

757
00:45:59,738 --> 00:46:01,734
Oh my God, it's him.

758
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:04,264
He's in the pool.

759
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:06,375
Oh my God!

760
00:46:06,414 --> 00:46:08,446
Jacob, get out of the pool now!

761
00:46:08,484 --> 00:46:10,441
Oh my God. That's him.

762
00:46:10,479 --> 00:46:14,277
- Get away from that man. - Why is everybody running to the pool?

763
00:46:14,315 --> 00:46:16,233
Brooke? Jake?

764
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,842
Dale, you'd better get over here.

765
00:46:22,793 --> 00:46:24,059
Get out of the pool!

766
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:36,373
Where's your sister?

767
00:46:44,659 --> 00:46:48,112
Why'd we have to get out, Mom?

768
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:50,796
l'm scared.

769
00:46:55,976 --> 00:46:58,968
- What did he do? - What's going on?

770
00:47:13,813 --> 00:47:16,498
l'm scared.

771
00:47:21,563 --> 00:47:24,171
Um, why the police is here?

772
00:47:24,209 --> 00:47:27,931
Um, there's a man over there who doesn't have a ticket to get in,

773
00:47:27,969 --> 00:47:29,503
so they're asking him to go home.

774
00:47:29,541 --> 00:47:31,536
Mr. McGorvey. Mr. McGorvey.

775
00:47:31,613 --> 00:47:33,416
lt'd be wise for you to get out of the pool at this time.

776
00:47:41,242 --> 00:47:43,275
Did that man go near you?

777
00:47:43,313 --> 00:47:45,845
You're sure he didn't touch you?

778
00:47:50,026 --> 00:47:52,175
Step out of the pool, sir.

779
00:48:10,665 --> 00:48:13,734
l was only trying to cool off.

780
00:48:13,772 --> 00:48:16,955
All right, let's go.

781
00:48:21,444 --> 00:48:24,321
You can go back in the pool.

782
00:48:56,045 --> 00:48:59,382
Bear with us, please. You know what that sounds means.

783
00:48:59,421 --> 00:49:02,836
Let's go. Out of the pool. We're closing her up. Let's go.

784
00:49:02,874 --> 00:49:05,750
Exit the pool and vacate the grounds immediately.

785
00:49:05,789 --> 00:49:07,708
Okay, l'll see you tomorrow.

786
00:49:07,746 --> 00:49:10,047
You're going to carry her? Come on, put her in the stroller.

787
00:49:10,123 --> 00:49:11,274
No, she won't do the stroller.

788
00:49:11,351 --> 00:49:12,695
- Really? - No, she will not do this.

789
00:49:12,541 --> 00:49:13,845
Lucy, would you like to go in the stroller?

790
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:16,377
Can l interest you in a stroller? lt appears she'd like a stroller.

791
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:19,752
lt's out of your way.

792
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:22,937
No, it's fine. You don't mind, do you, Aaron?

793
00:49:22,976 --> 00:49:25,124
Run!

794
00:49:35,136 --> 00:49:37,705
You'd better come inside. You can't walk home in this.

795
00:49:40,084 --> 00:49:41,580
Oh!

796
00:49:49,751 --> 00:49:53,087
- You can put him down in Lucy's room. - Okay.

797
00:49:57,769 --> 00:49:59,648
This is amazing.

798
00:49:59,687 --> 00:50:02,217
She never naps.

799
00:50:02,256 --> 00:50:04,482
Well, he'll be out for the next two hours.

800
00:50:04,327 --> 00:50:07,014
We'll have to get him out of that nightgown, though,

801
00:50:07,052 --> 00:50:09,085
before he wakes up or he'll never forgive me.

802
00:50:18,867 --> 00:50:20,746
Nice place.

803
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:22,588
- You think so? - Yeah.

804
00:50:22,627 --> 00:50:24,390
Well, Richard does all right for himself.

805
00:50:24,429 --> 00:50:26,385
What's he do, again?

806
00:50:26,424 --> 00:50:29,799
Lies. Um, please have a seat. Make yourself comfortable.

807
00:50:29,838 --> 00:50:31,372
Better not, l might ruin your furniture.

808
00:50:31,411 --> 00:50:34,173
l'll put these things in the dryer and get us some towels.

809
00:50:34,211 --> 00:50:35,975
Okay.

810
00:52:34,588 --> 00:52:37,466
Oh, God!

811
00:52:39,345 --> 00:52:41,685
Oh, God!

812
00:52:46,059 --> 00:52:48,436
Do you feel bad about this?

813
00:52:48,475 --> 00:52:50,815
No, l don't.

814
00:52:50,891 --> 00:52:52,694
l do.

815
00:52:52,733 --> 00:52:55,342
l feel really bad.

816
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:56,991
Okay.

817
00:53:30,557 --> 00:53:33,434
Son?

818
00:53:36,886 --> 00:53:38,920
Son?

819
00:53:42,104 --> 00:53:44,443
Be well.

820
00:53:49,278 --> 00:53:50,926
May knew it wasn't natural

821
00:53:50,965 --> 00:53:52,729
for a grown man to be living with his mother.

822
00:53:52,768 --> 00:53:54,686
No hobbies, no diversions.

823
00:53:54,762 --> 00:53:57,564
lt was like he was still in prison.

824
00:53:57,602 --> 00:53:59,481
What he needed was a girlfriend,

825
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:02,243
and May intended to help him find one.

826
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:05,234
There are four whole columns of lonely women here,

827
00:54:05,273 --> 00:54:07,767
and only a handful of men. The odds are on our side.

828
00:54:07,805 --> 00:54:10,069
Why wouldn't one of these women want

829
00:54:10,107 --> 00:54:12,792
to meet a nice person like you?

830
00:54:12,831 --> 00:54:15,133
l'm not a nice person.

831
00:54:15,171 --> 00:54:17,587
You did a bad thing.

832
00:54:17,625 --> 00:54:19,775
But that doesn't mean you're a bad person.

833
00:54:19,814 --> 00:54:22,153
l have a psychosexual disorder.

834
00:54:22,191 --> 00:54:23,495
You're better now.

835
00:54:23,534 --> 00:54:25,413
They wouldn't have let you out if you weren't.

836
00:54:25,452 --> 00:54:27,791
They let me out because they had to.

837
00:54:27,868 --> 00:54:30,209
Well, maybe if you found

838
00:54:30,285 --> 00:54:32,549
a girlfriend closer to your own age

839
00:54:32,587 --> 00:54:35,311
you wouldn't have the bad urges so often.

840
00:54:35,349 --> 00:54:37,765
l don't want a girlfriend my own age, Mommy.

841
00:54:37,803 --> 00:54:40,451
l wish l did.

842
00:54:43,251 --> 00:54:45,246
What are you going to do when l'm gone?

843
00:54:45,285 --> 00:54:47,585
Who's going to take care of you?

844
00:54:50,694 --> 00:54:52,611
What's the matter, Mommy?

845
00:54:55,488 --> 00:54:57,368
Are you sick or something?

846
00:54:57,406 --> 00:54:59,708
l'm an old woman. l'm not going to live forever,

847
00:54:59,746 --> 00:55:01,741
Who's going to cook for you?

848
00:55:01,818 --> 00:55:03,583
Who's going to wash the dishes?

849
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:05,961
l can wash the dishes,

850
00:55:06,037 --> 00:55:07,840
You've never washed a dish in your life.

851
00:55:07,879 --> 00:55:10,449
l could do it if l had to. l'm not a retard.

852
00:55:10,487 --> 00:55:13,020
No, you're not.

853
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,047
You're a miracle, Ronnie.

854
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:21,574
We're all miracles.

855
00:55:21,612 --> 00:55:24,182
You know why?

856
00:55:24,221 --> 00:55:26,369
Because as humans,

857
00:55:26,407 --> 00:55:30,127
everyday we go about our business,

858
00:55:30,204 --> 00:55:32,621
and all that time

859
00:55:32,698 --> 00:55:35,537
we know, we all know

860
00:55:35,576 --> 00:55:38,760
that the things we love,

861
00:55:38,798 --> 00:55:42,250
the people we love...

862
00:55:44,245 --> 00:55:47,775
at any time, it can all be taken away.

863
00:55:51,572 --> 00:55:54,525
We live knowing that

864
00:55:54,373 --> 00:55:57,327
and we keep going anyway.

865
00:56:02,735 --> 00:56:04,999
Animals don't do that.

866
00:56:09,372 --> 00:56:12,402
Now l'm not asking you to get married, Ronnie.

867
00:56:14,051 --> 00:56:17,312
l'm just saying put an ad in the paper, see what happens.

868
00:56:17,351 --> 00:56:20,496
Fine. l'll do it if it will make you happy.

869
00:56:20,535 --> 00:56:23,027
But just one date. All right?

870
00:56:26,135 --> 00:56:28,897
You have a nice smile, why don't we start with that?

871
00:56:28,936 --> 00:56:31,890
What else?

872
00:56:34,191 --> 00:56:37,145
You always eat what l put in front of you. You never complain.

873
00:56:37,222 --> 00:56:39,907
What else?

874
00:56:39,946 --> 00:56:41,632
You're trying to get back in shape.

875
00:56:41,671 --> 00:56:43,360
You exercise.

876
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:55,980
Wait right there, young man.

877
00:56:56,018 --> 00:56:58,397
lf you're going out for some exercise,

878
00:56:58,436 --> 00:57:00,967
you can post this now.

879
00:57:03,537 --> 00:57:06,069
Hmm.

880
00:57:36,796 --> 00:57:38,714
Mmm.

881
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,778
Come on.

882
00:57:43,817 --> 00:57:45,313
Let's do it again.

883
00:57:47,728 --> 00:57:49,993
All right.

884
00:57:51,144 --> 00:57:53,675
God, it's hot as hell up here.

885
00:57:53,714 --> 00:57:55,862
What's wrong with the laundry room?

886
00:57:55,901 --> 00:57:58,969
No mattress.

887
00:57:59,008 --> 00:58:01,962
Come on. Lie down.

888
00:58:16,385 --> 00:58:18,264
You're nervous, aren't you?

889
00:58:18,303 --> 00:58:20,067
What? What do you mean?

890
00:58:20,106 --> 00:58:21,869
The game.

891
00:58:21,908 --> 00:58:26,167
Don't worry. You'll be great tonight.

892
00:58:27,701 --> 00:58:30,769
l don't know. l haven't played in 10 years.

893
00:58:32,728 --> 00:58:35,335
lt used to be my whole life.

894
00:58:35,374 --> 00:58:38,021
Then when l stopped, l just...

895
00:58:38,059 --> 00:58:41,204
stopped. l didn't even miss it.

896
00:58:42,739 --> 00:58:45,194
Now that l'm playing again, l....

897
00:58:45,233 --> 00:58:47,764
feel l--

898
00:58:49,528 --> 00:58:51,946
l don't know.

899
00:58:51,984 --> 00:58:53,901
You feel alive.

900
00:58:53,941 --> 00:58:55,398
Yeah.

901
00:58:55,437 --> 00:58:57,892
That's good.

902
00:58:57,930 --> 00:58:59,809
That's how you're supposed to feel.

903
00:59:00,999 --> 00:59:03,338
You're right.

904
00:59:03,377 --> 00:59:06,408
l guess it's just been awhile.

905
00:59:07,904 --> 00:59:10,168
Yeah.

906
00:59:54,896 --> 00:59:56,813
Shake.

907
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:19,409
- Call it. - Heads.

908
01:00:20,943 --> 01:00:22,977
Heads it is.

909
01:00:25,661 --> 01:00:27,771
Ready?

910
01:00:36,287 --> 01:00:38,666
- Hello? - Hi, Mom. Did l wake you?

911
01:00:38,704 --> 01:00:40,508
Oh, no honey. ls everything okay?

912
01:00:40,546 --> 01:00:42,272
Yeah, l'm fine.

913
01:00:42,310 --> 01:00:43,921
You don't sound fine.

914
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:46,261
No, there's nothing wrong. l just wanted to say hi.

915
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:48,677
Well, hi.

916
01:00:48,716 --> 01:00:50,021
Hi.

917
01:00:50,059 --> 01:00:51,594
So how's my little guy?

918
01:00:51,632 --> 01:00:53,665
He's great. He's sleeping right here next to me.

919
01:00:53,742 --> 01:00:55,430
He's such a cutie.

920
01:00:55,507 --> 01:00:57,386
So where's Brad?

921
01:00:57,425 --> 01:00:59,343
Brad's out.

922
01:00:59,381 --> 01:01:02,143
Oh, l'm surprised the library stays open this late.

923
01:01:02,181 --> 01:01:03,793
Well, he's not at the library.

924
01:01:03,831 --> 01:01:05,289
He's playing football with some buddies.

925
01:01:05,327 --> 01:01:08,011
Oh, honey. Do you remember when your father took up golf?

926
01:01:08,050 --> 01:01:10,658
He's not like dad.

927
01:01:10,697 --> 01:01:12,961
Honey, they're all the same.

928
01:01:12,999 --> 01:01:15,186
Well, he's not.

929
01:01:15,224 --> 01:01:18,178
You work so hard.

930
01:01:18,217 --> 01:01:20,479
Now listen...

931
01:01:20,517 --> 01:01:22,819
l could keep an eye on the boys when you're at work;

932
01:01:22,896 --> 01:01:24,393
make sure they're staying out of trouble.

933
01:01:24,278 --> 01:01:26,655
- Do you want me to come up for a visit? - No no, Mom, don't come.

934
01:01:26,694 --> 01:01:28,191
Well, honey, l worry about you kids.

935
01:01:28,229 --> 01:01:30,338
Now what are you going to do if he fails the test again?

936
01:01:30,376 --> 01:01:31,872
He's not going to fail the test.

937
01:01:31,911 --> 01:01:33,600
Oh, honey, that's what you said last time.

938
01:01:33,638 --> 01:01:35,248
Now how are you doing for money?

939
01:01:35,286 --> 01:01:37,858
We're fine.

940
01:01:37,704 --> 01:01:40,811
l'm going to send you a little extra this month.

941
01:01:40,849 --> 01:01:42,537
- Mom... - Honey, it's no burden.

942
01:01:42,575 --> 01:01:45,644
- Mom... Mom, please. - l'm happy to help.

943
01:01:50,439 --> 01:01:53,086
Aw, shit.

944
01:01:58,841 --> 01:02:01,142
Although the Guardians lost by 26 points,

945
01:02:01,181 --> 01:02:04,018
Brad felt oddly exhilarated in the bar after the game.

946
01:02:05,862 --> 01:02:08,968
He could feel a new respect in the way the cops looked at him.

947
01:02:09,006 --> 01:02:12,075
- What you drinking, buddy? - He wasn't on probation anymore.

948
01:02:12,114 --> 01:02:13,340
He was a member of the team.

949
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:14,951
lce and Advil.

950
01:02:14,990 --> 01:02:17,139
lf all else fails, you can always see the team physician,

951
01:02:17,177 --> 01:02:19,478
Dr. Daniels. All his friends call him Jack.

952
01:02:19,516 --> 01:02:21,704
- To the good doctor. - Hear, hear.

953
01:02:24,695 --> 01:02:27,573
- Larry? Here, you go Larry. - Oh, thanks.

954
01:02:27,650 --> 01:02:29,645
Let me just grab a chair.

955
01:02:35,321 --> 01:02:39,082
Oh, we just gave you a shot. We just gave you a shot.

956
01:02:46,908 --> 01:02:49,631
l had no business being on that field tonight.

957
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:51,932
l let you down.

958
01:02:51,970 --> 01:02:53,582
l let the whole team down.

959
01:02:53,620 --> 01:02:55,308
l'm slow and l'm fat.

960
01:02:55,346 --> 01:02:57,187
l let that guy piss all over me.

961
01:02:57,225 --> 01:02:59,758
Come on. That guy was offsides the whole night.

962
01:03:03,210 --> 01:03:05,819
Joanie left me.

963
01:03:05,857 --> 01:03:08,735
Took the kids and went to her mother's.

964
01:03:10,307 --> 01:03:12,494
Jesus, Larry, that's a tough break.

965
01:03:12,532 --> 01:03:14,297
Oh, l deserved it.

966
01:03:14,335 --> 01:03:16,291
Me and my big mouth.

967
01:03:16,329 --> 01:03:18,400
l called her a fucking whore,

968
01:03:18,439 --> 01:03:20,358
right in front of the kids.

969
01:03:22,084 --> 01:03:24,271
Why did you do that?

970
01:03:24,309 --> 01:03:26,226
Huh, l don't know.

971
01:03:26,265 --> 01:03:30,063
l was in a bad mood or something.

972
01:03:29,948 --> 01:03:31,828
Now l'm fucked.

973
01:03:38,617 --> 01:03:40,920
Hey, did you hear about the pervert?

974
01:03:40,958 --> 01:03:42,876
He went swimming at the town pool.

975
01:03:42,915 --> 01:03:44,410
- What? - Yeah.

976
01:03:44,448 --> 01:03:46,903
- Who told you that? - Nobody. l saw it myself.

977
01:03:46,942 --> 01:03:49,013
- The town pool? - Yeah, during the heatwave.

978
01:03:49,051 --> 01:03:50,433
- The town pool? - Yep.

979
01:03:50,472 --> 01:03:52,160
Th-that place is crawling with kids.

980
01:03:52,198 --> 01:03:53,923
l mean, my boys go there.

981
01:03:53,962 --> 01:03:56,225
Yeah, well, you know what, it was just that one time.

982
01:03:56,263 --> 01:03:58,565
Um, he-- he won't be back. The cops came.

983
01:03:58,603 --> 01:04:01,366
Cops? What cops? Anyone from the team?

984
01:04:01,405 --> 01:04:02,823
Uh, no.

985
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:05,203
You sure?

986
01:04:05,241 --> 01:04:07,465
- Anyone from the team show up there? - No no.

987
01:04:07,503 --> 01:04:09,229
- Yes or no! - l'm saying no.

988
01:04:09,267 --> 01:04:10,304
- No, nobody... - Jesus Christ,

989
01:04:10,342 --> 01:04:12,414
that little fucking weasel.

990
01:04:12,452 --> 01:04:13,910
Larry, slow down.

991
01:04:13,948 --> 01:04:16,058
Slow down, Larry!

992
01:04:23,270 --> 01:04:25,418
- What now? - Good evening, Mrs. McGorvey.

993
01:04:25,457 --> 01:04:26,531
We were wondering if Ronnie was home.

994
01:04:26,569 --> 01:04:27,604
You leave him alone.

995
01:04:27,642 --> 01:04:29,408
We just want a little moment of his time. Just a little chat.

996
01:04:29,446 --> 01:04:31,248
This is my house. l pay the mortgage,

997
01:04:31,287 --> 01:04:33,052
and l say who is and isn't--

998
01:04:33,092 --> 01:04:34,587
Yoo-hoo, Ronnie!

999
01:04:34,663 --> 01:04:37,424
- Get your perverted ass down here now. - l'm calling the police.

1000
01:04:37,463 --> 01:04:39,688
l hear they're well-disposed to child molesters.

1001
01:04:39,726 --> 01:04:41,261
lt's okay, Mommy. Can l help you, gentlemen?

1002
01:04:41,299 --> 01:04:42,948
Ronnie, you go on upstairs.

1003
01:04:42,795 --> 01:04:45,328
Larry, let him go. l think he gets the point. We can go home now.

1004
01:04:45,366 --> 01:04:47,245
You listen to me, you little piece of shit.

1005
01:04:47,283 --> 01:04:49,432
You stay the fuck away from the town pool.

1006
01:04:49,470 --> 01:04:51,388
- You hear me? - You're a bully!

1007
01:04:58,485 --> 01:05:01,477
My Ronnie would never do what he did.

1008
01:05:04,201 --> 01:05:07,539
That poor child at the mall--

1009
01:05:08,804 --> 01:05:11,873
what you did to him.

1010
01:05:27,448 --> 01:05:29,635
Larry?

1011
01:05:33,278 --> 01:05:34,774
Larry?

1012
01:05:34,812 --> 01:05:38,074
Why did she say that?

1013
01:05:38,112 --> 01:05:40,568
Oh, don't pretend you don't know about me.

1014
01:05:40,644 --> 01:05:42,140
Everybody knows. Everybody!

1015
01:05:42,179 --> 01:05:45,248
Look, h-honestly, l-- l don't know anything.

1016
01:05:45,286 --> 01:05:47,856
l remember hearing something...

1017
01:05:47,895 --> 01:05:51,576
a few years ago when we first moved here, but--

1018
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:53,494
something about a-- a shooting

1019
01:05:53,533 --> 01:05:55,643
at the mall.

1020
01:05:55,681 --> 01:05:59,096
That's-- that's it. That's all.

1021
01:05:59,135 --> 01:06:01,435
l didn't even know you then.

1022
01:06:05,655 --> 01:06:07,649
l'm sorry.

1023
01:06:09,876 --> 01:06:11,793
Sorry.

1024
01:06:12,790 --> 01:06:14,823
lt's okay.

1025
01:06:20,578 --> 01:06:23,992
Dispatch said there was a shooter loose at the mall.

1026
01:06:24,030 --> 01:06:26,216
lt was 10 minutes from the end of my shift.

1027
01:06:26,254 --> 01:06:28,634
10 minutes and there would have been someone else.

1028
01:06:31,511 --> 01:06:34,196
l can still see that boy's face staring up at me.

1029
01:06:35,155 --> 01:06:38,760
Yeah, but-- but it was an accident.

1030
01:06:38,798 --> 01:06:40,756
You were trying to stop a guy,

1031
01:06:40,794 --> 01:06:43,940
and the-- the boy g-got caught

1032
01:06:44,017 --> 01:06:45,588
in the crossfire, right?

1033
01:06:45,665 --> 01:06:47,354
No, l panicked.

1034
01:06:47,392 --> 01:06:49,233
There was no shooter.

1035
01:06:49,271 --> 01:06:51,152
Just the boy.

1036
01:06:51,190 --> 01:06:54,258
Antoine Harris was his name.

1037
01:06:54,297 --> 01:06:57,060
He was big for his age, only 1 3 years old.

1038
01:06:57,098 --> 01:06:59,782
He was a good kid. Thought it was a joke,

1039
01:06:59,821 --> 01:07:01,663
waving around an air gun at his friend

1040
01:07:01,701 --> 01:07:03,274
in the Big 5.

1041
01:07:03,313 --> 01:07:06,151
They were acting out some scene from some movie they liked.

1042
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:08,145
Shop girl saw it from across the way,

1043
01:07:08,183 --> 01:07:11,483
called 911.

1044
01:07:11,521 --> 01:07:14,321
Jesus, that's terrible.

1045
01:07:14,398 --> 01:07:16,968
That...

1046
01:07:17,045 --> 01:07:19,384
well, you didn't know.

1047
01:07:19,461 --> 01:07:21,380
lt could have been real.

1048
01:07:21,457 --> 01:07:23,451
But it wasn't.

1049
01:07:28,974 --> 01:07:31,698
His parents...

1050
01:07:31,736 --> 01:07:34,117
uh, his parents--

1051
01:07:36,801 --> 01:07:38,719
l had to...

1052
01:07:55,598 --> 01:07:57,747
l was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress syndrome

1053
01:07:57,785 --> 01:08:00,815
by three different psychiatrists.

1054
01:08:00,853 --> 01:08:03,500
That's why l retired.

1055
01:08:03,538 --> 01:08:06,185
l couldn't do the job anymore.

1056
01:08:11,517 --> 01:08:14,126
- So why don't you do something else? - Like what?

1057
01:08:14,164 --> 01:08:17,004
Drive a forklift at Costco?

1058
01:08:18,845 --> 01:08:21,952
Maybe you could go back to school.

1059
01:08:22,029 --> 01:08:23,985
l loved my job.

1060
01:08:24,062 --> 01:08:26,288
l don't wanna do anything else.

1061
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:41,708
You ever think about the term ''homeland security''?

1062
01:08:43,548 --> 01:08:45,467
l mean, really think about it?

1063
01:08:51,222 --> 01:08:53,100
The day that you found out

1064
01:08:53,139 --> 01:08:56,515
that your father had been killed in lraq,

1065
01:08:56,553 --> 01:08:58,472
do you remember that day?

1066
01:08:58,549 --> 01:08:59,968
Can you talk about that?

1067
01:09:00,007 --> 01:09:02,078
You feel comfortable talking about that?

1068
01:09:06,374 --> 01:09:10,096
After the men came

1069
01:09:10,134 --> 01:09:12,550
to tell my mom,

1070
01:09:12,588 --> 01:09:14,928
l cried,

1071
01:09:14,967 --> 01:09:18,265
but she didn't.

1072
01:09:18,303 --> 01:09:20,952
She just went up to her room

1073
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:24,749
and grabbed the pillows off the bed,

1074
01:09:24,787 --> 01:09:27,625
cut the tops off of them with a pair scissors.

1075
01:09:29,813 --> 01:09:32,998
There were feathers all over the place.

1076
01:09:34,378 --> 01:09:36,296
That must have really frightened you.

1077
01:09:37,868 --> 01:09:41,052
No, she was trying to find the crown.

1078
01:09:42,088 --> 01:09:43,584
The crown?

1079
01:09:43,623 --> 01:09:45,502
The crown you leave in your pillow

1080
01:09:45,541 --> 01:09:47,804
when you've slept on it for a long time.

1081
01:09:50,182 --> 01:09:52,523
My--

1082
01:09:52,561 --> 01:09:55,054
my father had two crowns.

1083
01:09:55,131 --> 01:09:58,430
Stop there.

1084
01:09:58,469 --> 01:10:01,385
- You hungry? - No.

1085
01:10:01,423 --> 01:10:03,110
Mind if l get some lunch?

1086
01:10:03,149 --> 01:10:06,026
No, go ahead.

1087
01:10:26,549 --> 01:10:28,543
Brad?

1088
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:31,996
Honey, you there?

1089
01:10:31,881 --> 01:10:35,488
Pick up. l know you're there.

1090
01:10:35,526 --> 01:10:37,865
lt's Aaron's nap time.

1091
01:10:41,164 --> 01:10:43,466
Okay, l guess you guys are out somewhere.

1092
01:10:43,504 --> 01:10:45,959
Um...

1093
01:10:45,998 --> 01:10:48,453
l love you both.

1094
01:10:48,491 --> 01:10:50,524
Bye.

1095
01:11:35,981 --> 01:11:38,667
l certainly did.

1096
01:11:38,705 --> 01:11:40,969
Here we go.

1097
01:11:42,503 --> 01:11:44,421
l don't know, Jean. l don't think l'm up for this.

1098
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:46,148
Well, now don't be silly.

1099
01:11:46,186 --> 01:11:48,258
- lt'll be fun. - Really?

1100
01:11:48,296 --> 01:11:50,482
You're not the only little sister here tonight.

1101
01:11:50,522 --> 01:11:53,858
- Oh, that's good. - Oh!

1102
01:11:53,897 --> 01:11:55,891
Hi, would you like a glass?

1103
01:11:55,930 --> 01:11:59,382
Did anybody like this book? Because l really just hated it.

1104
01:11:59,421 --> 01:12:01,147
lt's so depressing.

1105
01:12:01,185 --> 01:12:03,219
She cheats on her husband with two different guys,

1106
01:12:03,295 --> 01:12:05,942
wastes all his money, then kills herself with rat poison?

1107
01:12:06,019 --> 01:12:07,821
Do l really need to read this?

1108
01:12:07,898 --> 01:12:11,466
Well, there is a lot of good descriptive writing.

1109
01:12:11,505 --> 01:12:13,383
lt's supposed to be depressing.

1110
01:12:13,422 --> 01:12:15,264
lt's a tragedy.

1111
01:12:15,302 --> 01:12:18,485
Madame Bovary was undone by a tragic flaw.

1112
01:12:18,524 --> 01:12:20,366
What's her flaw?

1113
01:12:20,405 --> 01:12:22,284
Blindness. She didn't see

1114
01:12:22,323 --> 01:12:24,394
that the men were just using her.

1115
01:12:24,432 --> 01:12:27,040
She just wants a little romance in her life.

1116
01:12:27,078 --> 01:12:30,532
- You can't blame her for that. - lt's about women's choices.

1117
01:12:30,570 --> 01:12:33,101
Back then, a woman didn't have a lot of choices.

1118
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:35,288
You could be a nun or a wife.

1119
01:12:35,365 --> 01:12:38,740
- That's all there was. - Or a prostitute.

1120
01:12:38,817 --> 01:12:39,892
She had a choice.

1121
01:12:39,969 --> 01:12:42,461
She had a choice not to cheat on her husband.

1122
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:46,259
l found it refreshing to read about a woman

1123
01:12:46,298 --> 01:12:48,062
reclaiming her sexuality.

1124
01:12:48,101 --> 01:12:50,134
ls that a nice way of saying she's a slut?

1125
01:12:50,172 --> 01:12:52,820
Madame Bovary's not a slut.

1126
01:12:52,858 --> 01:12:56,617
She's one of the great characters in Western literature.

1127
01:12:56,655 --> 01:12:59,953
l was a little puzzled by some of the sexual references.

1128
01:12:59,992 --> 01:13:01,566
Look, like this one.

1129
01:13:01,604 --> 01:13:04,136
Um...

1130
01:13:04,174 --> 01:13:06,590
''He abandoned every last shred

1131
01:13:06,668 --> 01:13:08,547
of restraint and consideration.

1132
01:13:08,586 --> 01:13:12,001
He turned her into something compliant,

1133
01:13:12,078 --> 01:13:14,378
something corrupt.''

1134
01:13:18,253 --> 01:13:20,477
Does anyone know what that means?

1135
01:13:20,515 --> 01:13:22,165
lt means she's a slut.

1136
01:13:22,203 --> 01:13:24,084
ls he tying her up

1137
01:13:24,122 --> 01:13:26,155
or something?

1138
01:13:26,194 --> 01:13:28,533
Anal sex.

1139
01:13:28,571 --> 01:13:30,797
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1140
01:13:30,835 --> 01:13:34,287
Did everyone get that but me?

1141
01:13:34,325 --> 01:13:37,088
Let's set that aside for now.

1142
01:13:37,127 --> 01:13:39,044
l'm really eager to hear what

1143
01:13:39,082 --> 01:13:41,806
our other little sister has to say.

1144
01:13:41,844 --> 01:13:44,453
l'm not sure if you know this, but Sarah has a PhD

1145
01:13:44,530 --> 01:13:47,292
in English lit.

1146
01:13:47,330 --> 01:13:49,402
Just a masters.

1147
01:13:49,441 --> 01:13:51,320
l never wrote my dissertation.

1148
01:13:51,358 --> 01:13:54,236
Well, you still have a lot more expertise

1149
01:13:54,274 --> 01:13:56,537
than the rest of us.

1150
01:14:01,102 --> 01:14:03,864
l think l understand your feelings about this book.

1151
01:14:03,902 --> 01:14:07,278
l used to have some problems with it myself.

1152
01:14:07,316 --> 01:14:09,196
When l read it in grad school,

1153
01:14:09,234 --> 01:14:12,111
Madame Bovary just seemed like a fool.

1154
01:14:12,187 --> 01:14:14,490
She marries the wrong man,

1155
01:14:14,528 --> 01:14:17,943
makes one foolish mistake after another.

1156
01:14:17,982 --> 01:14:21,509
But when l read it this time, l just fell in love with her.

1157
01:14:21,547 --> 01:14:24,042
She's trapped.

1158
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:26,842
She has a choice. She can either accept a life of misery

1159
01:14:26,881 --> 01:14:30,410
or she can struggle against it.

1160
01:14:30,448 --> 01:14:32,673
And she chooses to struggle.

1161
01:14:32,712 --> 01:14:34,782
Some struggle-- hop into bed

1162
01:14:34,821 --> 01:14:36,701
with every guy who says hello.

1163
01:14:36,740 --> 01:14:40,268
Well, she fails in the end, but there's something beautiful

1164
01:14:40,306 --> 01:14:43,529
and even heroic in her rebellion.

1165
01:14:43,605 --> 01:14:46,061
My professors would kill me for even thinking this,

1166
01:14:46,099 --> 01:14:48,018
but...

1167
01:14:48,095 --> 01:14:50,549
in her own strange way,

1168
01:14:50,626 --> 01:14:52,505
Emma Bovary is a feminist.

1169
01:14:52,544 --> 01:14:54,385
Oh, that's nice.

1170
01:14:54,423 --> 01:14:57,109
So now cheating on your husband makes you a feminist?

1171
01:14:57,147 --> 01:14:59,602
No no no.

1172
01:14:59,641 --> 01:15:03,208
lt's not the cheating. lt's the hunger.

1173
01:15:03,247 --> 01:15:05,432
The hunger for an alternative,

1174
01:15:05,471 --> 01:15:08,771
and the refusal to accept a life of unhappiness.

1175
01:15:15,369 --> 01:15:18,783
Maybe l didn't understand the book.

1176
01:15:20,970 --> 01:15:22,811
She just looks so pathetic.

1177
01:15:24,421 --> 01:15:26,417
ls she pretty?

1178
01:15:27,759 --> 01:15:29,448
Who?

1179
01:15:32,210 --> 01:15:33,896
Your wife.

1180
01:15:33,935 --> 01:15:35,816
Degrading yourself for nothing.

1181
01:15:35,854 --> 01:15:38,346
lt's a simple question.

1182
01:15:38,385 --> 01:15:40,726
She's pretty, okay? Do we have to talk about this now?

1183
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:46,172
l mean, did she really think a man like that was gonna run away with her?

1184
01:15:49,817 --> 01:15:52,463
Possibly.

1185
01:15:53,961 --> 01:15:55,839
How pretty is she?

1186
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:02,899
A knockout.

1187
01:16:07,002 --> 01:16:09,074
Beauty's overrated, Sarah.

1188
01:16:13,946 --> 01:16:16,977
Brad had meant this to be comforting.

1189
01:16:17,015 --> 01:16:20,543
But at 3:00 in the morning, it had precisely the opposite effect.

1190
01:16:22,463 --> 01:16:24,726
He had a beautiful wife,

1191
01:16:24,764 --> 01:16:28,293
a knockout, and she was sleeping beside him right now.

1192
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:31,822
Only someone who took his own beauty for granted

1193
01:16:31,861 --> 01:16:34,393
would have been able to say something so stupid

1194
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:36,503
and with a straight face.

1195
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:02,242
Weekends were difficult for Sarah.

1196
01:17:02,281 --> 01:17:03,776
48-hour prison stretches

1197
01:17:03,814 --> 01:17:06,578
separating one happy blur of weekdays

1198
01:17:06,616 --> 01:17:08,649
from the rest.

1199
01:17:10,874 --> 01:17:13,826
l'm going to the ocean.

1200
01:17:13,866 --> 01:17:16,398
- You are? - l'm going to the ocean.

1201
01:17:16,436 --> 01:17:18,508
ls he doing his ocean dance?

1202
01:17:23,187 --> 01:17:26,026
Sarah sometimes let herself be carried away by fantasies

1203
01:17:26,103 --> 01:17:29,671
of a future very different from the life she was living now,

1204
01:17:29,709 --> 01:17:31,971
in which she and Brad were free to love each other

1205
01:17:32,010 --> 01:17:33,737
in broad daylight;

1206
01:17:33,775 --> 01:17:35,347
where they had no one to answer to

1207
01:17:35,386 --> 01:17:37,728
but each other.

1208
01:17:37,766 --> 01:17:41,332
lt could happen, she thought. lt had to,

1209
01:17:41,370 --> 01:17:43,673
because she wasn't sure she could keep living like this

1210
01:17:43,711 --> 01:17:46,204
for very much longer.

1211
01:17:52,534 --> 01:17:55,065
Open your mouth again.

1212
01:17:54,950 --> 01:17:57,905
No, l don't want to.

1213
01:17:57,943 --> 01:18:00,743
May your mouth be open.

1214
01:18:00,781 --> 01:18:02,662
May your mouth.

1215
01:18:02,738 --> 01:18:05,039
This is coming into your mouth.

1216
01:18:06,957 --> 01:18:09,489
Open your mouth, little fishy.

1217
01:18:09,527 --> 01:18:11,869
Hungry, hungry.

1218
01:18:13,210 --> 01:18:15,972
Little fishy is not hungry?

1219
01:18:18,735 --> 01:18:20,730
You okay?

1220
01:18:22,110 --> 01:18:24,450
Yeah, fine.

1221
01:18:26,138 --> 01:18:28,592
- How about you? - Great.

1222
01:18:32,199 --> 01:18:34,117
So how was your weekend?

1223
01:18:37,071 --> 01:18:39,410
You really wanna know? lt sucked.

1224
01:18:41,444 --> 01:18:43,286
How was yours?

1225
01:18:43,324 --> 01:18:45,396
Terrible.

1226
01:18:46,431 --> 01:18:48,732
- Really? - Yeah.

1227
01:18:50,689 --> 01:18:52,914
Yeah, we went to the beach and all Kathy and l did

1228
01:18:52,953 --> 01:18:55,523
was argue the whole time.

1229
01:18:55,561 --> 01:18:58,899
Oh, you did?

1230
01:19:01,201 --> 01:19:03,079
Yeah, it was our annual argument

1231
01:19:03,118 --> 01:19:05,956
over taking the bar exam,

1232
01:19:05,995 --> 01:19:07,991
like our whole life depends on it.

1233
01:19:08,029 --> 01:19:10,445
Get it over with. You'll feel better.

1234
01:19:10,483 --> 01:19:12,593
lt's this whole thing.

1235
01:19:12,631 --> 01:19:14,896
Gotta take a train on Wednesday.

1236
01:19:14,934 --> 01:19:17,696
lt's a two-day ordeal.

1237
01:19:17,734 --> 01:19:20,073
l'm not even gonna pass.

1238
01:19:20,112 --> 01:19:22,376
- You'll be fine. - No.

1239
01:19:22,414 --> 01:19:26,211
No, l won't.

1240
01:19:26,250 --> 01:19:28,628
l haven't cracked a book all summer.

1241
01:19:37,413 --> 01:19:40,059
l missed you.

1242
01:19:40,097 --> 01:19:42,668
l missed you, too.

1243
01:19:47,771 --> 01:19:50,071
Don't-- don't do it.

1244
01:19:51,146 --> 01:19:53,294
- What? - The test.

1245
01:19:53,332 --> 01:19:55,903
- Oh. - Blow it off.

1246
01:19:55,942 --> 01:19:58,435
We should go somewhere,

1247
01:19:58,473 --> 01:20:00,391
just for a night, you know?

1248
01:20:00,430 --> 01:20:02,117
Richard's out of town till Friday,

1249
01:20:02,193 --> 01:20:04,227
and l'm sure l can get a sitter for Lucy.

1250
01:20:07,949 --> 01:20:10,327
No, l can't do that.

1251
01:20:10,174 --> 01:20:12,781
l gotta take the test.

1252
01:20:23,177 --> 01:20:25,594
That's good.

1253
01:20:25,632 --> 01:20:28,164
- Looks good? - Yeah.

1254
01:20:28,203 --> 01:20:30,121
Well, l have a good feeling about this whole thing.

1255
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:32,998
ln fact, l think l'm gonna go buy a bottle of champagne

1256
01:20:33,036 --> 01:20:35,146
and put it in the fridge, and we can open it to celebrate

1257
01:20:35,223 --> 01:20:37,755
when we get the good news.

1258
01:20:37,831 --> 01:20:40,709
Don't get your hopes up.

1259
01:20:40,785 --> 01:20:42,664
We've been through this before.

1260
01:20:42,702 --> 01:20:45,580
Huh-uh. This time's gonna be different.

1261
01:20:45,619 --> 01:20:47,614
l can feel it.

1262
01:21:16,807 --> 01:21:20,143
Can you believe it? This is our first date.

1263
01:21:20,182 --> 01:21:23,136
Like a date, you know, without the kids, l mean.

1264
01:21:23,175 --> 01:21:26,320
How was Lucy? Did she cry or anything?

1265
01:21:26,358 --> 01:21:28,468
No, are you kidding?

1266
01:21:28,506 --> 01:21:31,116
With Jean there, she just about shoved me out the door.

1267
01:21:35,527 --> 01:21:39,246
l thought we could make something really beautiful.

1268
01:21:39,323 --> 01:21:42,355
l have so many things here.

1269
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:44,926
We could make...

1270
01:21:44,964 --> 01:21:47,073
a picture frame.

1271
01:21:48,645 --> 01:21:52,482
Or a jewelry box.

1272
01:21:53,556 --> 01:21:57,392
Or a hat.

1273
01:21:59,272 --> 01:22:02,341
Something for my mommy.

1274
01:22:02,379 --> 01:22:04,297
Okay.

1275
01:22:06,982 --> 01:22:08,209
- Stop it, stop it. - No, Ronnie.

1276
01:22:08,248 --> 01:22:10,895
Ron-- Ron-- Ronnie, just hold on.

1277
01:22:10,971 --> 01:22:14,003
Now there.

1278
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:17,263
You look handsome. She won't be disappointed.

1279
01:22:17,339 --> 01:22:20,255
Wait'll she hears about my criminal record.

1280
01:22:20,293 --> 01:22:22,558
l don't think you need to get into that just yet.

1281
01:22:22,596 --> 01:22:24,591
Why don't you stick to small talk?

1282
01:22:24,629 --> 01:22:27,467
What if someone recognizes me?

1283
01:22:27,505 --> 01:22:30,919
That's highly unlikely. l made the dinner reservation

1284
01:22:30,958 --> 01:22:33,222
at a restaurant over in Haverhill.

1285
01:22:49,448 --> 01:22:51,327
Sheila.

1286
01:22:53,745 --> 01:22:56,046
- Sheila. - Yeah.

1287
01:22:59,269 --> 01:23:01,724
Something wrong with the food?

1288
01:23:03,143 --> 01:23:05,406
No, it's fine.

1289
01:23:05,445 --> 01:23:09,166
Back at the house you mentioned you were on medication.

1290
01:23:11,544 --> 01:23:14,842
- What kind? - All kinds.

1291
01:23:14,919 --> 01:23:16,800
Mostly psychotropic.

1292
01:23:19,829 --> 01:23:23,013
So you had some kind of a breakdown?

1293
01:23:23,052 --> 01:23:26,812
Mm-hmm, my junior year in college.

1294
01:23:26,851 --> 01:23:28,844
You were that young?

1295
01:23:30,763 --> 01:23:32,642
What happened?

1296
01:23:32,681 --> 01:23:35,404
l don't really know.

1297
01:23:35,443 --> 01:23:38,320
Well, nervous breakdowns don't just come out of nowhere.

1298
01:23:39,587 --> 01:23:41,926
Something must have caused it.

1299
01:23:41,964 --> 01:23:44,419
l guess.

1300
01:23:44,458 --> 01:23:47,335
But l was fine before l left for college.

1301
01:23:48,985 --> 01:23:51,132
l don't know. Maybe it was the stress

1302
01:23:51,171 --> 01:23:52,897
of being on my own.

1303
01:23:52,935 --> 01:23:55,544
Maybe it's a chemical imbalance in my brain.

1304
01:23:55,582 --> 01:23:58,767
Every psychiatrist l go to has a different opinion.

1305
01:23:58,806 --> 01:24:01,874
This one guy, Dr. Faris,

1306
01:24:01,912 --> 01:24:05,518
he said l must have been sexually abused as a child.

1307
01:24:05,556 --> 01:24:07,128
When l told him l wasn't,

1308
01:24:07,167 --> 01:24:09,584
he said l must be repressing the memory.

1309
01:24:09,623 --> 01:24:13,229
Right, um, so what happened after that?

1310
01:24:13,267 --> 01:24:15,032
Did you drop out of school?

1311
01:24:15,070 --> 01:24:17,755
Not right away.

1312
01:24:17,794 --> 01:24:19,904
My mother wanted me to go

1313
01:24:19,980 --> 01:24:21,937
to the campus counseling center.

1314
01:24:22,014 --> 01:24:24,315
And they wanted the problem fixed, like l could just

1315
01:24:24,392 --> 01:24:27,192
snap my fingers and everything would be okay again.

1316
01:24:27,231 --> 01:24:29,648
Yeah, l know all about that.

1317
01:24:29,686 --> 01:24:32,947
You do?

1318
01:24:32,985 --> 01:24:36,438
Yes, l do.

1319
01:24:39,429 --> 01:24:42,959
So they said l could leave school

1320
01:24:42,997 --> 01:24:45,529
and get married and have lots of kids like my sisters,

1321
01:24:45,568 --> 01:24:47,638
and l can't take care of kids.

1322
01:24:47,676 --> 01:24:50,016
l can't even take care of myself

1323
01:24:50,092 --> 01:24:53,124
most of the time. Besides, who's gonna marry me?

1324
01:24:53,201 --> 01:24:56,385
You're not so bad.

1325
01:24:56,423 --> 01:24:58,341
What?

1326
01:24:59,568 --> 01:25:01,948
You're-- you're not so bad.

1327
01:25:07,471 --> 01:25:09,926
l haven't had a real boyfriend in six years,

1328
01:25:09,965 --> 01:25:12,880
not since my second breakdown.

1329
01:25:12,918 --> 01:25:15,527
l had this thing happen on a Greyhound bus.

1330
01:25:15,565 --> 01:25:18,595
- l was-- - Do you want me to wrap that up?

1331
01:25:18,633 --> 01:25:21,204
Oh, no, thank you.

1332
01:25:21,242 --> 01:25:23,929
No, wrap it up, please. l'll take it home.

1333
01:25:24,005 --> 01:25:26,614
Folks gonna want dessert?

1334
01:25:26,690 --> 01:25:29,644
What do you say, Sheila? You wanna share something sweet?

1335
01:25:34,324 --> 01:25:36,740
Let's make a little stop.

1336
01:25:36,778 --> 01:25:38,467
Take the next left.

1337
01:25:45,027 --> 01:25:47,289
Turn off the lights.

1338
01:25:54,502 --> 01:25:56,535
l had a nice time tonight.

1339
01:26:03,325 --> 01:26:05,856
The last guy l went out with,

1340
01:26:05,895 --> 01:26:07,622
you know what he did?

1341
01:26:07,660 --> 01:26:10,383
He ditched me.

1342
01:26:10,421 --> 01:26:13,337
He got up to go to the men's room,

1343
01:26:13,375 --> 01:26:15,332
never came back.

1344
01:26:16,790 --> 01:26:20,510
Stuck me with the check.

1345
01:26:20,356 --> 01:26:22,812
Never said goodbye.

1346
01:26:22,851 --> 01:26:25,804
Never called to apologize.

1347
01:26:25,844 --> 01:26:29,142
He wasn't my type anyway. He was a big-shot CPA.

1348
01:26:29,219 --> 01:26:32,633
Super normal guy. Didn't want to be dating some psycho.

1349
01:26:39,998 --> 01:26:42,184
But you seem like a nice person.

1350
01:27:09,805 --> 01:27:12,451
Better not tell on me.

1351
01:27:15,635 --> 01:27:17,552
You hear me?

1352
01:27:21,159 --> 01:27:23,806
You better not tell, or l'll fucking get you.

1353
01:28:22,076 --> 01:28:24,724
Hold on, Mom. Hold on, Dad.

1354
01:28:24,763 --> 01:28:28,176
You should park the car on the escalator, and back...

1355
01:28:28,214 --> 01:28:30,593
- So? - What?

1356
01:28:30,631 --> 01:28:34,430
- Up, down and then up. - Test, dummy. How'd it go?

1357
01:28:34,507 --> 01:28:36,385
lt was all right.

1358
01:28:38,494 --> 01:28:40,452
You didn't call home last night.

1359
01:28:40,528 --> 01:28:42,024
l was worried.

1360
01:28:42,062 --> 01:28:44,096
Go on the escalator.

1361
01:28:44,134 --> 01:28:46,091
Guess l could really use that cell phone.

1362
01:28:47,279 --> 01:28:49,735
Go on the escalator.

1363
01:28:49,774 --> 01:28:51,882
Go on the escalator.

1364
01:29:19,580 --> 01:29:22,226
- Well, look who's back. - Oh, hi.

1365
01:29:22,265 --> 01:29:24,567
Hi, Jean.

1366
01:29:24,605 --> 01:29:26,486
Thanks.

1367
01:29:26,524 --> 01:29:28,364
You're a lifesaver.

1368
01:29:28,403 --> 01:29:30,282
So how was your old roommate?

1369
01:29:30,321 --> 01:29:31,510
Oh, great.

1370
01:29:31,548 --> 01:29:34,309
Yeah, thanks for doing this on such short notice.

1371
01:29:34,348 --> 01:29:37,648
Let me give you something for your time.

1372
01:29:37,725 --> 01:29:39,950
That's not necessary.

1373
01:29:39,834 --> 01:29:43,134
No, really. l insist.

1374
01:29:44,475 --> 01:29:45,972
Please don't.

1375
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:50,576
Okay.

1376
01:29:50,614 --> 01:29:52,876
Uh, any calls?

1377
01:29:52,915 --> 01:29:54,372
Nope, it was very quiet.

1378
01:29:54,411 --> 01:29:57,826
She's asleep on your bed. lt was a very busy day.

1379
01:29:57,864 --> 01:29:59,591
That's great.

1380
01:29:59,629 --> 01:30:02,582
Um, Jean, is everything okay?

1381
01:30:05,804 --> 01:30:08,337
Yeah, she's a wonderful child.

1382
01:30:26,865 --> 01:30:28,783
Mommy.

1383
01:30:39,332 --> 01:30:41,250
Mommy!

1384
01:30:42,249 --> 01:30:43,859
Yeah.

1385
01:30:43,936 --> 01:30:46,121
Are you coming?

1386
01:30:49,766 --> 01:30:53,066
- l have something. - What?

1387
01:30:53,104 --> 01:30:55,176
l have something for you.

1388
01:30:59,279 --> 01:31:01,391
Just give me a second here, okay?

1389
01:31:28,051 --> 01:31:30,122
Brad.

1390
01:31:34,342 --> 01:31:36,797
Brad.

1391
01:31:37,871 --> 01:31:39,789
Hmm.

1392
01:31:41,362 --> 01:31:44,317
Aaron's been telling me about his new friend Lucy.

1393
01:31:45,276 --> 01:31:47,692
She sounds like a sweet little girl.

1394
01:31:49,264 --> 01:31:51,183
What's her mother like?

1395
01:31:55,287 --> 01:31:58,548
Nice enough, l guess.

1396
01:31:58,586 --> 01:32:00,965
l can't even remember her name.

1397
01:32:04,570 --> 01:32:06,642
lsn't it Sarah?

1398
01:32:07,831 --> 01:32:10,554
Sarah?

1399
01:32:10,401 --> 01:32:12,742
Yeah, Sarah,

1400
01:32:12,780 --> 01:32:14,275
from the pool.

1401
01:32:14,314 --> 01:32:17,499
Her daughter's name is Lucy.

1402
01:32:17,537 --> 01:32:19,914
Oh, Lucy's mom. Yeah, l forgot. That's right.

1403
01:32:19,991 --> 01:32:22,562
Her name is Sarah.

1404
01:32:22,639 --> 01:32:25,745
Hmm.

1405
01:32:25,784 --> 01:32:27,703
Yeah, it might be really nice for Aaron

1406
01:32:27,741 --> 01:32:30,847
if they came over for dinner.

1407
01:32:34,645 --> 01:32:36,679
Okay.

1408
01:32:58,698 --> 01:33:01,268
So you're in advertising?

1409
01:33:01,307 --> 01:33:03,991
No, that's-- that's a common misconception.

1410
01:33:04,029 --> 01:33:05,948
l'm not in advertising. l'm in branding.

1411
01:33:05,987 --> 01:33:08,019
And that's very different.

1412
01:33:08,057 --> 01:33:09,938
Richard's pretty high up in the company.

1413
01:33:09,976 --> 01:33:11,856
Yeah yeah, l have these clients

1414
01:33:11,894 --> 01:33:13,735
and they'll come to me when they have,

1415
01:33:13,773 --> 01:33:15,807
you know, a new product they wanna sell.

1416
01:33:15,846 --> 01:33:19,183
Like, um, these guys, they were in a couple weeks ago.

1417
01:33:19,221 --> 01:33:22,175
They're trying to open this chain of Chinese restaurants, right?

1418
01:33:22,252 --> 01:33:25,435
They're talking to me and l-- l look down at the table

1419
01:33:25,473 --> 01:33:27,775
and l realize that none of these guys were Chinese.

1420
01:33:27,813 --> 01:33:30,615
Where were they from?

1421
01:33:30,653 --> 01:33:32,685
They're a bunch of fat cats from Tennessee.

1422
01:33:32,724 --> 01:33:35,256
They think they can start a chain of Chinese restaurants good enough

1423
01:33:35,294 --> 01:33:37,174
to fool the average American boob.

1424
01:33:37,212 --> 01:33:39,168
Oh, God.

1425
01:33:39,207 --> 01:33:41,624
Mmm!

1426
01:33:41,662 --> 01:33:43,504
- This is delicious. - lsn't it?

1427
01:33:43,543 --> 01:33:46,150
Brad's a fantastic cook.

1428
01:33:46,189 --> 01:33:49,258
So you guys see these fliers with the guy's face

1429
01:33:49,296 --> 01:33:51,214
plastered all over our village?

1430
01:33:51,252 --> 01:33:53,669
Lots of Sturm und Drang in our quiet little town, huh?

1431
01:33:53,708 --> 01:33:55,242
Yeah, it's crazy.

1432
01:33:55,319 --> 01:33:57,851
What l want to know is why they let a creep like that out of prison.

1433
01:33:57,927 --> 01:34:00,612
Some of the people going after him are just as crazy.

1434
01:34:00,650 --> 01:34:03,490
- What do you mean? - Well, just today l heard that

1435
01:34:03,528 --> 01:34:05,638
some nut's been spray-painting the poor guy's house,

1436
01:34:05,485 --> 01:34:08,630
lighting fires on his porch. God knows what else.

1437
01:34:08,669 --> 01:34:10,547
- Do they know who's doing it? - Huh-uh.

1438
01:34:10,586 --> 01:34:12,466
They think it's some ex-cop.

1439
01:34:12,505 --> 01:34:14,499
You know, that guy who killed that kid at the mall.

1440
01:34:14,538 --> 01:34:16,187
Yeah, l don't think it's him.

1441
01:34:16,226 --> 01:34:18,987
You're biased. You're friends with the guy.

1442
01:34:19,025 --> 01:34:21,941
Brad's on that Committee of Concerned Parents

1443
01:34:21,787 --> 01:34:23,476
with him.

1444
01:34:23,514 --> 01:34:25,240
l didn't know you were on that.

1445
01:34:25,278 --> 01:34:27,581
l play on his football team.

1446
01:34:27,658 --> 01:34:30,765
He asked me to distribute some fliers.

1447
01:34:30,842 --> 01:34:32,797
He's on your team.

1448
01:34:32,874 --> 01:34:35,675
You never told me that.

1449
01:34:35,713 --> 01:34:37,248
Yeah.

1450
01:34:39,587 --> 01:34:42,963
You know what's weird? l've never even seen this McGorvey guy.

1451
01:34:43,001 --> 01:34:45,227
- We did. - No, we didn't.

1452
01:34:45,265 --> 01:34:47,183
Not you. Me and Brad.

1453
01:34:47,221 --> 01:34:50,175
That day at the pool, remember?

1454
01:34:50,213 --> 01:34:53,358
Yeah, l-l totally forgot.

1455
01:34:55,355 --> 01:34:58,307
- Well, what happened? - Sexual tension is an elusive thing,

1456
01:34:58,384 --> 01:35:00,648
but Kathy had pretty good radar for it.

1457
01:35:00,724 --> 01:35:04,062
lt was like someone had turned a knob a hair to the right,

1458
01:35:04,138 --> 01:35:06,670
and the radio station clicked in so loud and clear

1459
01:35:06,747 --> 01:35:09,356
it almost knocked her over.

1460
01:35:09,394 --> 01:35:11,810
Once she became aware of the connection between them,

1461
01:35:11,657 --> 01:35:14,688
it seemed impossible that she'd missed it before.

1462
01:35:14,726 --> 01:35:17,373
On a hunch, Kathy dropped her fork

1463
01:35:17,412 --> 01:35:19,368
in the hopes that while retrieving it

1464
01:35:19,406 --> 01:35:22,705
she would catch Sarah and Brad playing footsie,

1465
01:35:22,744 --> 01:35:25,083
- but she was mistaken. - Asked him to leave, and he left.

1466
01:35:25,121 --> 01:35:28,114
But you know what? He didn't look scary, right? l mean--

1467
01:35:28,153 --> 01:35:30,837
No, it-- it wasn't that big of a deal, you know.

1468
01:35:30,914 --> 01:35:33,599
- No, he's like a regular guy, you know? - Yeah, l mean--

1469
01:35:33,676 --> 01:35:35,594
Kathy, are you okay?

1470
01:35:35,671 --> 01:35:37,475
Uh, yeah.

1471
01:35:37,513 --> 01:35:40,543
Just a sec.

1472
01:35:40,581 --> 01:35:42,116
Brad had convinced himself

1473
01:35:42,155 --> 01:35:44,417
the dinner party had gone well.

1474
01:35:44,455 --> 01:35:47,947
That he and Sarah had managed to put Kathy's suspicions to rest,

1475
01:35:47,986 --> 01:35:50,133
at least temporarily.

1476
01:35:50,171 --> 01:35:52,129
She certainly hadn't accused him of anything,

1477
01:35:52,167 --> 01:35:54,046
or behaved in a way that made him think

1478
01:35:54,084 --> 01:35:56,041
she'd noticed anything untoward.

1479
01:36:01,105 --> 01:36:04,557
l'm really glad they came over.

1480
01:36:10,081 --> 01:36:12,843
- Good night. - Good night.

1481
01:36:12,881 --> 01:36:14,492
Two days later, however,

1482
01:36:14,530 --> 01:36:16,794
his mother-in-law showed up for a surprise visit...

1483
01:36:16,833 --> 01:36:19,633
- Thank you, John. - ...of ominously indeterminate length.

1484
01:36:19,671 --> 01:36:22,318
And from that moment on, she accompanied Brad

1485
01:36:22,357 --> 01:36:24,005
and Aaron everywhere:

1486
01:36:24,044 --> 01:36:25,809
To the playground;

1487
01:36:25,848 --> 01:36:28,647
- We need some butter. - To the supermarket;

1488
01:36:28,685 --> 01:36:31,180
And to the town pool.

1489
01:36:31,218 --> 01:36:33,711
Hi, Aaron.

1490
01:36:33,749 --> 01:36:36,971
Hi, Lucy.

1491
01:36:38,276 --> 01:36:40,885
The worst of it was the pool.

1492
01:36:40,924 --> 01:36:43,647
Nevertheless, after threatening all week

1493
01:36:43,686 --> 01:36:46,677
to go the football game, Brad's mother-in-law decided against it

1494
01:36:46,715 --> 01:36:48,596
at the last minute.

1495
01:36:48,633 --> 01:36:50,629
- So are you coming? - Well, l'd like to,

1496
01:36:50,668 --> 01:36:52,546
but l'm a little tired.

1497
01:36:52,585 --> 01:36:54,886
You sure? You're welcome to.

1498
01:36:54,925 --> 01:36:56,804
No, go ahead. You and Aaron

1499
01:36:56,843 --> 01:36:59,068
sure kept me hopping this afternoon.

1500
01:36:59,106 --> 01:37:01,138
Looks like you're on your own.

1501
01:37:00,986 --> 01:37:04,017
Oh, that's my ride.

1502
01:37:03,864 --> 01:37:06,625
- What time are you gonna be home? - l don't know.

1503
01:37:06,702 --> 01:37:08,275
Pretty late, though.

1504
01:37:08,351 --> 01:37:11,189
Be careful and stay out of trouble.

1505
01:37:23,811 --> 01:37:26,113
Winds whisper of high hopes,

1506
01:37:26,150 --> 01:37:28,223
victory is in the skies.

1507
01:37:28,261 --> 01:37:31,560
One joins with many on the summer's green field.

1508
01:37:31,598 --> 01:37:34,667
At 0 and 5, the Guardians were the basement dwellers

1509
01:37:34,706 --> 01:37:37,391
of the Tri-County Touch Football Night League.

1510
01:37:37,429 --> 01:37:41,150
The Controllers, a team of young hotshots from the financial district

1511
01:37:41,189 --> 01:37:43,951
were 4 and 1 with an explosive offense

1512
01:37:43,989 --> 01:37:47,173
that regularly racked up 40 to 50 points a game.

1513
01:37:47,020 --> 01:37:49,090
But from the opening kickoff,

1514
01:37:49,129 --> 01:37:52,581
this ragtag group of law enforcement officers

1515
01:37:52,620 --> 01:37:54,768
decided to crunch their own numbers.

1516
01:37:58,259 --> 01:38:00,522
But the Controllers scored first

1517
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:02,517
after recovering a Bart Williams fumble

1518
01:38:02,363 --> 01:38:06,277
deep in Guardians' territory near the end of the second quarter.

1519
01:38:10,841 --> 01:38:13,756
The Guardians evened things up early in the second half...

1520
01:38:15,522 --> 01:38:17,708
moving methodically downfield

1521
01:38:17,746 --> 01:38:19,741
on an 80-yard touchdown drive.

1522
01:38:24,575 --> 01:38:27,720
The Controllers regained the lead with a fourth quarter field goal.

1523
01:38:27,759 --> 01:38:31,173
With less than a minute to go, trailing by three,

1524
01:38:31,211 --> 01:38:33,168
the Guardians faced the extinction of their hopes.

1525
01:38:33,206 --> 01:38:35,737
- Down! - lt was their last chance--

1526
01:38:35,775 --> 01:38:38,040
4th and 5 on their own 35.

1527
01:38:38,078 --> 01:38:40,725
Set!

1528
01:38:40,763 --> 01:38:43,525
Hut, hut!

1529
01:39:14,943 --> 01:39:17,935
Yeah yeah yeah!

1530
01:39:18,011 --> 01:39:21,120
Yeah yeah!

1531
01:39:21,158 --> 01:39:23,075
Yeah yeah!

1532
01:39:24,341 --> 01:39:26,835
Yeah!

1533
01:39:27,909 --> 01:39:29,520
Oh my God!

1534
01:39:29,558 --> 01:39:32,435
Yeah!

1535
01:39:41,872 --> 01:39:44,941
Brad, Brad!

1536
01:39:46,054 --> 01:39:47,511
What do you want?

1537
01:39:47,587 --> 01:39:51,002
Everyone is waiting for us at the bar. Are-- are-- are you coming?

1538
01:39:51,079 --> 01:39:53,226
Why don't you go on ahead? l'll catch up later.

1539
01:39:53,265 --> 01:39:55,721
You're gonna come, right? l mean, we gotta celebrate.

1540
01:39:55,759 --> 01:39:57,523
Yeah yeah yeah, l'll be there.

1541
01:39:57,561 --> 01:40:00,438
- You promise? - Jesus, Larry, l just told you.

1542
01:40:00,477 --> 01:40:03,547
- Well, you got a ride? - Yeah.

1543
01:40:05,273 --> 01:40:07,535
Okay.

1544
01:40:07,574 --> 01:40:09,607
l'll have a cold one waiting for you.

1545
01:40:13,597 --> 01:40:15,476
Larry, you have to go home now.

1546
01:40:15,515 --> 01:40:17,625
Just give me five more minutes. He promised he was coming.

1547
01:40:17,664 --> 01:40:20,540
l don't care what he promised, l want to lock up.

1548
01:40:20,617 --> 01:40:22,459
Now get your butt out of here!

1549
01:40:22,536 --> 01:40:25,182
Now!

1550
01:40:31,050 --> 01:40:35,347
When l looked up there and saw you it was just...

1551
01:40:35,386 --> 01:40:39,606
wow... wow.

1552
01:40:39,644 --> 01:40:42,675
Thank God you came.

1553
01:40:42,713 --> 01:40:45,897
l don't want to go home.

1554
01:40:45,935 --> 01:40:49,273
l want to stay right here forever.

1555
01:40:49,311 --> 01:40:51,037
No, l do. For the first time in my life

1556
01:40:51,114 --> 01:40:53,645
l feel like anything is possible. Like l can do anything, you know?

1557
01:40:57,981 --> 01:41:00,244
What are we doing?

1558
01:41:00,283 --> 01:41:03,696
What do you mean?

1559
01:41:03,734 --> 01:41:06,651
lt's not real, Brad.

1560
01:41:06,689 --> 01:41:08,529
What?

1561
01:41:08,568 --> 01:41:11,330
This. lt's wrong and it's weird.

1562
01:41:11,368 --> 01:41:12,979
How long are we gonna sneak around together?

1563
01:41:13,018 --> 01:41:15,012
How long can that last? l can't do this anymore.

1564
01:41:15,051 --> 01:41:16,279
No, no don't say that.

1565
01:41:16,318 --> 01:41:19,962
As long as l know that we're gonna have this--

1566
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,265
Have what?

1567
01:41:21,304 --> 01:41:24,219
What is this?

1568
01:41:24,296 --> 01:41:26,407
Look...

1569
01:41:26,483 --> 01:41:29,130
if that dinner at your house was any indication,

1570
01:41:29,169 --> 01:41:31,968
you seem pretty happy with your wife.

1571
01:41:32,007 --> 01:41:33,502
You know, you have a perfect life

1572
01:41:33,541 --> 01:41:35,459
- and l don't wanna to be the-- - Okay, stop stop stop.

1573
01:41:37,799 --> 01:41:40,561
Run away with me.

1574
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:42,364
What?

1575
01:41:44,704 --> 01:41:46,813
You don't mean that.

1576
01:41:46,851 --> 01:41:51,341
You believe in me.

1577
01:41:51,379 --> 01:41:53,604
Come on.

1578
01:41:53,681 --> 01:41:56,634
We'll go away, figure this thing out.

1579
01:41:56,710 --> 01:41:59,857
lt's not weird.

1580
01:41:59,895 --> 01:42:02,734
The kids are comfortable with each other.

1581
01:42:02,773 --> 01:42:05,802
l know there's more to it than that, but...

1582
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:08,297
let's do this.

1583
01:42:08,335 --> 01:42:11,634
Please. Please, Sarah.

1584
01:42:13,858 --> 01:42:16,544
Oh my God.

1585
01:42:16,583 --> 01:42:20,034
You really mean it, don't you?

1586
01:42:20,073 --> 01:42:22,414
Yes.

1587
01:42:24,292 --> 01:42:27,860
Okay.

1588
01:42:27,937 --> 01:42:30,392
Okay. Okay. Yes!

1589
01:42:30,469 --> 01:42:33,116
Yes! Okay, yes.

1590
01:42:36,568 --> 01:42:39,789
Fucking Brad, l'm so sick of hearing about Brad.

1591
01:42:39,828 --> 01:42:42,476
l'm fucking over it.

1592
01:42:42,514 --> 01:42:45,545
l don't even like him. He's a loser.

1593
01:42:45,583 --> 01:42:47,271
''Brad made the fucking touchdown.''

1594
01:42:47,309 --> 01:42:49,188
Yeah, you know why he hasn't the balls to show up here?

1595
01:42:49,226 --> 01:42:52,143
'Cause l fucking made the block. lt's bullshit.

1596
01:42:52,181 --> 01:42:54,943
That's why he's not even here, he's fucking embarrassed to see me.

1597
01:42:54,982 --> 01:42:59,508
l don't even like anybody in this fucking town.

1598
01:43:11,668 --> 01:43:14,009
Wake up, wake up!

1599
01:43:14,047 --> 01:43:17,000
Wake up, Woodward Court!

1600
01:43:17,039 --> 01:43:18,497
Okay, l'm awake.

1601
01:43:18,536 --> 01:43:22,793
Open your eyes! Get your goddamn heads out of the sand!

1602
01:43:22,831 --> 01:43:25,172
My heads? My goddamn heads?

1603
01:43:25,211 --> 01:43:27,204
Don't you people love your children?

1604
01:43:27,243 --> 01:43:30,273
Don't you want to protect them from evil?

1605
01:43:30,350 --> 01:43:33,343
Woodward Court, there's a pervert in your midst!

1606
01:43:33,228 --> 01:43:35,874
There's a goddamn pervert in your midst!

1607
01:43:35,951 --> 01:43:38,828
Open your eyes! Protect the children!

1608
01:43:38,905 --> 01:43:40,823
Save the children!

1609
01:43:40,861 --> 01:43:43,431
Wake up and see the grass!

1610
01:43:43,470 --> 01:43:45,580
- Just stay inside, Ronnie. - Save the children!

1611
01:43:45,618 --> 01:43:47,269
Open your goddamn eyes!

1612
01:43:47,307 --> 01:43:50,068
Wake up and save your children!

1613
01:43:50,106 --> 01:43:53,788
You dirty son of a bitch! Get off my lawn!

1614
01:43:53,826 --> 01:43:56,782
Who the hell do you think you are, Mr. High and Mighty?

1615
01:43:56,821 --> 01:43:59,160
No perverts in Woodward Court!

1616
01:43:59,198 --> 01:44:01,039
No perverts in Woodward Court!

1617
01:44:01,078 --> 01:44:02,651
You think you're God? Far from it!

1618
01:44:02,727 --> 01:44:05,029
l don't think l'm God! l never said l was!

1619
01:44:04,914 --> 01:44:06,794
You murderer, you killed the boy.

1620
01:44:06,832 --> 01:44:09,402
l didn't murder anyone. Now why don't you go back inside, put some clothes on?

1621
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:11,512
You shot him through the neck. l read it in the paper.

1622
01:44:11,550 --> 01:44:14,235
- No perverts in-- - You son of a bitch. Give me that.

1623
01:44:14,273 --> 01:44:16,384
Hey hey!

1624
01:44:16,422 --> 01:44:17,650
Give me that! You're--

1625
01:44:17,688 --> 01:44:19,452
- You need to go home. - The police are coming.

1626
01:44:19,490 --> 01:44:20,872
l mean, you're scaring my kids.

1627
01:44:20,911 --> 01:44:23,135
Your kids need to be frightened!

1628
01:44:23,173 --> 01:44:24,824
They live across the street from a pervert!

1629
01:44:26,895 --> 01:44:28,505
Ow! Oh!

1630
01:44:28,544 --> 01:44:31,421
Oh my God, Mrs. McGorvey. Are you okay?

1631
01:44:32,955 --> 01:44:36,331
May. May!

1632
01:44:36,369 --> 01:44:38,479
May-- l think we should call an ambulance.

1633
01:44:38,518 --> 01:44:40,781
Karen, call an ambulance, right now!

1634
01:44:40,819 --> 01:44:43,006
- l'm doing it! - Oh, fuck.

1635
01:44:43,044 --> 01:44:47,533
- May! - This is all l need.

1636
01:44:54,745 --> 01:44:57,621
Excuse me, Mr. McGorvey, we need to ask you some questions.

1637
01:45:33,145 --> 01:45:35,522
$14.35.

1638
01:45:47,491 --> 01:45:50,175
The Fed continuing its campaign against inflation

1639
01:45:50,213 --> 01:45:53,705
by raising short-term interest rates for the 10th time yesterday.

1640
01:45:53,744 --> 01:45:57,235
Usually there is a correlation between inflation and gold prices.

1641
01:45:57,081 --> 01:46:00,035
Let's take you over to our stocks desk...

1642
01:46:00,073 --> 01:46:04,178
Cafe con leche?

1643
01:46:04,216 --> 01:46:05,789
Thank you.

1644
01:46:09,587 --> 01:46:13,462
Kim Bryson, please call the operator.

1645
01:46:13,538 --> 01:46:16,300
Kim Bryson, please call the operator.

1646
01:46:18,909 --> 01:46:20,175
Madre.

1647
01:46:23,129 --> 01:46:26,888
Me too. She's resting.

1648
01:47:09,008 --> 01:47:10,964
Get down, knock it off!

1649
01:47:11,002 --> 01:47:12,959
Quiet.

1650
01:47:12,998 --> 01:47:15,837
Bring him around.

1651
01:47:23,930 --> 01:47:25,772
lt's all yours.

1652
01:48:12,803 --> 01:48:14,490
Mr. McGorvey.

1653
01:48:15,565 --> 01:48:19,210
Mr. McGorvey.

1654
01:48:19,287 --> 01:48:21,626
l'm afraid we have some bad news.

1655
01:48:24,196 --> 01:48:26,804
Do you have a mortuary to make arrangements for you?

1656
01:48:28,761 --> 01:48:32,444
lt's not a problem. The hospital has a list that l can provide you with.

1657
01:48:32,482 --> 01:48:34,554
Here's what's going to happen:

1658
01:48:34,592 --> 01:48:37,239
Your mother's body will remain in her bed

1659
01:48:37,277 --> 01:48:38,811
for up to three hours.

1660
01:48:38,849 --> 01:48:40,998
Three hours is typical.

1661
01:48:41,037 --> 01:48:44,528
But if there's a request for more time, depending on our occupancy,

1662
01:48:44,565 --> 01:48:46,676
that's usually not a problem.

1663
01:48:46,714 --> 01:48:50,242
lf there's anyone you need to call--

1664
01:48:50,319 --> 01:48:52,545
family, friends--

1665
01:48:52,622 --> 01:48:54,884
they're welcome to full bedside visitation privileges

1666
01:48:54,961 --> 01:48:56,765
before the body is taken downstairs

1667
01:48:56,803 --> 01:48:59,526
to be prepped for transport.

1668
01:48:59,564 --> 01:49:02,366
Do you have any questions that come to mind?

1669
01:49:07,045 --> 01:49:08,771
Anything l can help you with?

1670
01:49:11,879 --> 01:49:13,720
- No. - Okay.

1671
01:49:13,758 --> 01:49:16,597
l'd like to remind you to take your mother's personal belongings with you

1672
01:49:16,635 --> 01:49:18,630
before you leave the hospital today.

1673
01:49:18,668 --> 01:49:20,203
And all l need from you now

1674
01:49:20,241 --> 01:49:23,233
is to sign this release- of-remains form.

1675
01:53:21,186 --> 01:53:23,450
Aaron.

1676
01:53:25,751 --> 01:53:28,323
Hey hey, buddy.

1677
01:53:28,361 --> 01:53:32,235
Can you wake up?

1678
01:53:36,070 --> 01:53:39,370
Could you take your hat off for me?

1679
01:53:39,447 --> 01:53:42,017
Just for a second.

1680
01:53:47,042 --> 01:53:49,881
Are you mad at me, Daddy?

1681
01:53:49,919 --> 01:53:53,871
No. No no no, not at all.

1682
01:53:53,909 --> 01:53:57,744
l just want you to know

1683
01:53:57,783 --> 01:54:00,545
that l love you very much,

1684
01:54:00,584 --> 01:54:05,226
and l would never do anything to hurt you, okay?

1685
01:54:05,264 --> 01:54:07,756
Okay.

1686
01:54:13,894 --> 01:54:16,848
Now you can go back to sleep.

1687
01:55:13,969 --> 01:55:17,344
Lucy, come on.

1688
01:55:17,421 --> 01:55:20,220
Let's go.

1689
01:55:20,259 --> 01:55:22,907
l will not go in the car seat!

1690
01:55:24,824 --> 01:55:27,893
- You have to go in the car-- - l will not go in the car seat!

1691
01:55:27,931 --> 01:55:29,159
Yes, you will!

1692
01:55:29,197 --> 01:55:30,426
- You will go in the car seat. - No, l won't!

1693
01:55:30,464 --> 01:55:31,882
Yes, you will. Go in the car seat.

1694
01:55:31,921 --> 01:55:35,643
l will not go in the car seat!

1695
01:55:35,681 --> 01:55:37,291
Okay, just...

1696
01:55:40,208 --> 01:55:41,588
you don't have to go in the car seat.

1697
01:55:41,626 --> 01:55:44,043
You can just go here. No, actually...

1698
01:55:44,081 --> 01:55:45,502
go on the floor. Okay.

1699
01:55:45,540 --> 01:55:47,994
Okay, go down on the floor. You have to stay down, okay?

1700
01:55:47,841 --> 01:55:50,449
Mommy is gonna get arrested. Just stay down, okay?

1701
01:55:50,526 --> 01:55:51,639
Okay.

1702
01:56:09,554 --> 01:56:13,121
Mommy, l want to go home.

1703
01:56:13,159 --> 01:56:15,653
Yeah, in a minute,

1704
01:56:15,691 --> 01:56:17,571
as soon as Brad gets here.

1705
01:56:31,150 --> 01:56:33,453
Hello?

1706
01:56:35,830 --> 01:56:39,476
Ronnie?

1707
01:57:05,637 --> 01:57:07,632
Oh my God.

1708
01:57:22,785 --> 01:57:25,355
- Are you all right? - Yeah! Let's do it. Let's go!

1709
01:57:27,809 --> 01:57:30,380
Hey, dude!

1710
01:57:30,457 --> 01:57:33,525
What's the hurry?

1711
01:57:36,824 --> 01:57:40,085
Yeah! Oh!

1712
01:57:40,123 --> 01:57:43,692
- This is so sick. - Damn.

1713
01:57:43,730 --> 01:57:45,417
- Nice. - Oh, man.

1714
01:57:45,456 --> 01:57:47,872
Yeah, man.

1715
01:57:47,911 --> 01:57:49,522
- How about you take a run? - What?

1716
01:57:49,560 --> 01:57:51,785
Yeah, give it a shot. See what happens.

1717
01:57:51,824 --> 01:57:54,625
You guys are crazy, l can't do that.

1718
01:57:54,702 --> 01:57:58,192
lt's not about that, it's about skating.

1719
01:58:08,894 --> 01:58:11,234
Whoo!

1720
01:58:11,272 --> 01:58:14,687
Come on. Come on.

1721
01:59:05,900 --> 01:59:07,203
Do you need help?

1722
01:59:16,602 --> 01:59:19,632
She's g-- gone.

1723
01:59:19,671 --> 01:59:22,164
She's gone.

1724
01:59:22,202 --> 01:59:26,422
Who? Who's gone?

1725
01:59:26,461 --> 01:59:29,414
Mommy. Mommy's gone.

1726
01:59:33,289 --> 01:59:35,359
l...

1727
01:59:35,398 --> 01:59:38,199
l'm sorry.

1728
01:59:38,238 --> 01:59:40,194
She loved me.

1729
01:59:43,608 --> 01:59:45,909
She's the only one.

1730
01:59:49,746 --> 01:59:51,586
Mommy died.

1731
01:59:54,003 --> 01:59:56,036
Mommy died.

1732
02:00:04,169 --> 02:00:05,972
Lucy?

1733
02:00:08,312 --> 02:00:12,724
Lucy! Lucy!

1734
02:00:12,762 --> 02:00:15,371
Lucy!

1735
02:00:15,409 --> 02:00:18,018
Lucy!

1736
02:00:18,056 --> 02:00:21,318
Lucy! Lucy!

1737
02:00:21,356 --> 02:00:25,536
Lucy! Lucy!

1738
02:00:29,180 --> 02:00:31,828
Lucy!

1739
02:00:31,866 --> 02:00:33,861
Lucy!

1740
02:00:42,684 --> 02:00:45,868
Get in the car seat! Get in the car seat!

1741
02:01:09,114 --> 02:01:11,454
lt's okay, Mommy.

1742
02:01:15,060 --> 02:01:16,787

Would you like to go home?

1746
02:01:37,924 --> 02:01:40,071
Yeah?

1747
02:01:57,220 --> 02:01:59,904
Brad.

1748
02:01:59,942 --> 02:02:02,743
Brad, can you hear me?

1749
02:02:02,781 --> 02:02:06,810
D-- don't move. The ambulance is on its way.

1750
02:02:06,657 --> 02:02:09,648
Jesus.

1751
02:02:09,686 --> 02:02:11,681
What happened to me?

1752
02:02:11,758 --> 02:02:14,442
These kids say you've been out cold for the last five minutes.

1753
02:02:14,481 --> 02:02:17,742
- You almost had it. - Dude, you were awesome.

1754
02:02:17,781 --> 02:02:21,463
- That shit was gnarly, son. - Back up, back up! Give him some space.

1755
02:02:21,502 --> 02:02:24,417
You just hold still, all right? Hold still.

1756
02:02:28,637 --> 02:02:30,056
Hey, bro!

1757
02:02:30,095 --> 02:02:32,780
Here, this fell out of your pocket.

1758
02:02:35,082 --> 02:02:36,961
l don't need it anymore.

1759
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,532
- Hey, Duane. - Hm?

1760
02:02:39,570 --> 02:02:42,370
Could you call my wife?

1761
02:02:42,446 --> 02:02:44,250
You got it, buddy.

1762
02:02:44,288 --> 02:02:46,359

Oh my God!

Hold on, Ronnie.

You hold on.

02:04:04,770 --> 02:04:07,416
l'm not gonna let anything happen to you.

1772
02:04:07,454 --> 02:04:09,872
You hold on there, okay, buddy?

1773
02:04:12,788 --> 02:04:14,629
ln his wildest dreams

1774
02:04:14,667 --> 02:04:18,427
Larry would never have imagined he'd once again be in this position,

1775
02:04:18,503 --> 02:04:21,802
where precious minutes count.

1776
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:24,565
Tonight he could save a life.

1777
02:04:24,603 --> 02:04:27,057
He knew Ronnie had done some bad things in the past,

1778
02:04:27,095 --> 02:04:31,660
but so had Larry.

1779
02:04:31,699 --> 02:04:34,424
You couldn't change the past.

1780
02:04:36,801 --> 02:04:40,637
But the future could be a different story.

1781
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,493
And it had to start somewhere.
