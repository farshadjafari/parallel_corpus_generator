<i>September 21, 1945...
That was the night I died.</i>

2
00:00:41,464 --> 00:00:43,424
Damn tramps...

3
00:00:43,883 --> 00:00:46,177
Watch it!

4
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:47,428
Disgusting!

5
00:00:47,512 --> 00:00:48,972
Is he dead?

6
00:00:49,013 --> 00:00:51,099
The Americans will be
arriving any day now...

7
00:00:51,182 --> 00:00:54,102
It's disgraceful,
having these bums here!

8
00:01:03,361 --> 00:01:05,280
Mama---!

9
00:01:06,656 --> 00:01:10,118
What day is it?

10
00:01:20,795 --> 00:01:23,131
Setsuko...

11
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:35,143
Another one.

12
00:01:48,489 --> 00:01:50,074
What is
this stuff?

13
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,119
Never mind.
Just dump it!

14
00:02:05,256 --> 00:02:07,175
This one's a goner, too.

15
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,762
You can see
it in their eyes...

21
00:04:37,367 --> 00:04:40,828
Air raid!
Get to the shelters!

22
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,500
We are in for a big one!

23
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:48,837
The shelter behind the
firehouse should be safest!

24
00:04:53,132 --> 00:04:54,467
It's hot!

25
00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:57,679
Be a good girl...
Try to be patient.

26
00:05:01,766 --> 00:05:04,686
I'd better get
over to the shelter.

27
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:08,773
Be careful, and get over
there as soon as you can.

28
00:05:08,815 --> 00:05:11,568
Setsuko, be a good girl
and mind your brother.

29
00:05:11,901 --> 00:05:13,862
Never mind us!
Get to the shelter!

30
00:05:14,362 --> 00:05:16,239
Yes, yes...

31
00:05:17,073 --> 00:05:19,492
Mom, do you have
your medicine?

32
00:05:19,534 --> 00:05:22,370
Right here.
Don't worry.

33
00:05:26,332 --> 00:05:28,293
I hate the shelter!

34
00:05:28,334 --> 00:05:32,797
Well, you will be sorry if you get
blown up by a bomb! Now get on.

35
00:05:38,887 --> 00:05:40,805
My doll!

36
00:05:52,817 --> 00:05:54,986
Air raid!

37
00:05:55,028 --> 00:05:56,988
Seita!

38
00:06:09,542 --> 00:06:11,503
Get down!

39
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,650
Seita!

40
00:07:28,371 --> 00:07:29,706
Seita!

41
00:09:27,031 --> 00:09:30,493
Long live the Emperor!

42
00:09:50,763 --> 00:09:53,683
We are safe here.
Don't worry.

43
00:09:54,767 --> 00:09:57,437
Where's Mama?

44
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,939
In the shelter.

45
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:04,110
The firehouse shelter can take
a hit from a 250 kilo bomb easy.

46
00:10:04,152 --> 00:10:06,613
Don't worry about her.

47
00:10:17,874 --> 00:10:21,127
She will probably go to
Niponmatsu station to find us...

48
00:10:21,169 --> 00:10:23,713
We will meet her there.

49
00:10:24,047 --> 00:10:26,966
Let's just
catch our breath first.

50
00:10:32,847 --> 00:10:34,766
Are you okay,
Setsuko?

51
00:10:34,849 --> 00:10:37,769
I lost one
of my shoes.

52
00:10:39,312 --> 00:10:42,273
I will buy you better ones.

53
00:10:43,858 --> 00:10:46,027
I have money.

54
00:10:52,158 --> 00:10:54,077
Open this.

55
00:11:05,004 --> 00:11:06,714
Wow, you are rich.

56
00:11:15,765 --> 00:11:18,601
Black rain,
from the bombing...

57
00:11:56,681 --> 00:11:59,601
It's all gone!

58
00:12:01,311 --> 00:12:07,108
Look, that was the civic hall.
We ate lunch there, once.

59
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,696
Is our house
gone too?

60
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:13,698
Probably.

61
00:12:13,781 --> 00:12:16,117
What will we do?

62
00:12:17,035 --> 00:12:19,204
Dad will make them pay for this!

63
00:12:34,177 --> 00:12:37,138
Mother!

64
00:12:46,481 --> 00:12:49,901
Well, it's not like I was the
only one who lost his house.

65
00:12:49,984 --> 00:12:52,362
We are all in the same boat.

66
00:12:57,492 --> 00:13:00,411
At least
we are still alive.

67
00:13:02,497 --> 00:13:05,458
There were two direct hits.
The fires are impossible to put out!

68
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,420
When you try to smother them,
it just spreads the oil around.

69
00:13:09,963 --> 00:13:12,382
It's not her...
She's not down here!

70
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,930
Seita, I have to pee.

71
00:13:29,858 --> 00:13:34,946
All residents of
lchirizuka and Kaminishi!

72
00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:40,869
Please report to the elementary
school for first aid services!

73
00:13:40,952 --> 00:13:41,953
What's wrong?

74
00:13:42,036 --> 00:13:43,496
My eye hurts.

75
00:13:43,538 --> 00:13:45,498
Don't rub it.

76
00:13:46,499 --> 00:13:48,793
We will get it washed
out at the school.

77
00:13:48,835 --> 00:13:50,837
Where's Mama?

78
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,130
She will be
at the school.

79
00:13:52,172 --> 00:13:53,298
School?

80
00:13:53,381 --> 00:13:56,050
Uh-huh. Let's go.

81
00:14:12,859 --> 00:14:14,777
Seita!

82
00:14:16,863 --> 00:14:18,948
Have you seen your mom?

83
00:14:19,032 --> 00:14:24,662
She's hurt. You'd better go.
I will watch your sister.

84
00:14:24,746 --> 00:14:27,665
Wasn't that scary, Setsuko?
Did you cry?

85
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,295
Seita has to go somewhere.
Why don't we wait for him?

86
00:14:40,178 --> 00:14:43,932
Seita. I have been looking for you.
Are you okay?

87
00:14:44,015 --> 00:14:44,641
My mom...?

88
00:14:44,724 --> 00:14:46,267
This way.

89
00:14:53,942 --> 00:14:56,736
This IS your mother's, isn't it?

90
00:15:00,156 --> 00:15:02,075
In here.

91
00:15:13,878 --> 00:15:15,797
She's finally asleep.

92
00:15:19,676 --> 00:15:24,639
She really should be in
a proper hospital.

93
00:15:25,849 --> 00:15:29,435
I think Kaisei hospital in
Nishinomiya wasn't hit.

94
00:15:30,478 --> 00:15:35,483
My mother has heart trouble.
Can she get her medicine?

95
00:15:35,525 --> 00:15:37,944
I will ask.

96
00:15:40,697 --> 00:15:43,324
I will be around if
you need me.

97
00:15:48,913 --> 00:15:50,874
Mom...

98
00:16:11,728 --> 00:16:13,479
You saw her?

99
00:16:13,521 --> 00:16:15,857
It's terrible...

100
00:16:16,232 --> 00:16:18,484
I'm thirsty.

101
00:16:23,281 --> 00:16:26,201
If there's anything
I can do, just ask.

102
00:16:28,203 --> 00:16:31,039
Oh, did you get your
biscuit ration yet?

103
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,500
I will get it for you!

104
00:16:43,551 --> 00:16:47,847
Keep this ring in your purse.
Don't lose it.

105
00:16:48,765 --> 00:16:52,810
Mom's... hurt.
She will get better, though.

106
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:55,146
Where is she?

107
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:58,191
In the hospital.
In Nishinomiya.

108
00:17:01,736 --> 00:17:05,657
We will stay here
at the school tonight.

109
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:10,662
Then tomorrow we will go to our
aunt's place in Nishinomiya.

110
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:14,207
Okay?

111
00:17:24,425 --> 00:17:27,637
We will all be on the second floor.
Why don't you stop by later?

112
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:34,185
Thanks a lot. We will.

113
00:17:35,019 --> 00:17:37,480
See you later, Setsuko.

114
00:17:40,066 --> 00:17:41,818
Want some?

115
00:17:41,901 --> 00:17:44,654
I want to see Mama.

116
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,700
Maybe tomorrow.
It's too late now.

117
00:18:41,169 --> 00:18:44,088
Watch me, I'm good at this!

118
00:19:08,404 --> 00:19:11,658
We haven't unbandaged her.
You don't want to see the body.

119
00:19:11,741 --> 00:19:15,203
With this heat we are having...
She will have to go on the truck today.

120
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,639
Where's your sister?

121
00:19:34,722 --> 00:19:38,101
In Nishinomiya.
We have a distant aunt there.

122
00:19:38,184 --> 00:19:40,812
I think she will
take care of us.

123
00:19:40,937 --> 00:19:43,523
I see. Lucky for you.

124
00:19:43,606 --> 00:19:47,193
I'd better get back to work.
Good luck to you.

125
00:21:15,365 --> 00:21:17,158
Mama!

126
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:19,828
Where is she?

127
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:22,163
Is she still sick?

128
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:24,833
Yeah. Still sick...

129
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,793
Welcome back.

130
00:21:29,045 --> 00:21:31,631
How's your mother?
ls she at Kaisei?

131
00:21:34,884 --> 00:21:36,845
Lucky your dad's in the Navy.

132
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:39,806
You get to have a truck
help move you over here!

133
00:21:40,974 --> 00:21:44,727
I have laid out futons and
mosquito netting in your room.

134
00:21:44,811 --> 00:21:46,187
Thanks.

135
00:21:54,696 --> 00:21:57,657
Doesn't Mama need her ring?

136
00:21:58,825 --> 00:22:01,953
Did she give it to me?

137
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,627
Just be careful
you don't lose it.

138
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:18,178
Mom's...

139
00:22:19,512 --> 00:22:23,141
When Mom's a little better,
I will take you to see her.

140
00:22:24,893 --> 00:22:27,145
Time for bed. Okay?

141
00:24:21,342 --> 00:24:25,638
Dried bonito... Herring...
Dried potato... Eggs...

142
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,141
Pickled plums...

143
00:24:28,975 --> 00:24:31,811
And I do believe this is butter!

144
00:24:34,022 --> 00:24:36,983
You can't get these for
ANYTHING nowadays.

145
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:40,403
Soldiers always get the
best at times like these.

146
00:24:40,528 --> 00:24:43,823
Anyway, did you stop by
the hospital?

147
00:24:44,991 --> 00:24:47,952
I'd like to tell your mother
what's been happening.

148
00:24:47,994 --> 00:24:51,539
And I could take Setsuko
along to visit her.

149
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:55,043
That bad?!

150
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:58,588
Mom... died while she
was still at the school.

151
00:24:58,671 --> 00:25:01,591
What?! She's dead!

152
00:25:02,967 --> 00:25:08,848
Then why didn't you tell me?
Why were you hiding it?!

153
00:25:08,932 --> 00:25:11,392
I didn't want Setsuko to know.

154
00:25:13,353 --> 00:25:17,315
Dead... How awful!

155
00:25:18,691 --> 00:25:21,653
You'd best write your
father and tell him!

156
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:29,702
Seita!

157
00:25:29,744 --> 00:25:32,664
Look!
She bought me new shoes!

158
00:25:34,415 --> 00:25:36,292
Good for you,
Setsuko.

159
00:25:36,376 --> 00:25:39,087
Hello there!

160
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:58,857
You poor dears...

161
00:25:58,898 --> 00:26:00,859
Thanks ma'am.

162
00:26:03,987 --> 00:26:06,155
What's that?

163
00:26:06,239 --> 00:26:10,160
Bullfrogs.
Nothing to be scared of.

164
00:26:10,243 --> 00:26:11,995
Firefly!

165
00:26:19,586 --> 00:26:21,963
Try to catch it.

166
00:26:26,926 --> 00:26:29,095
Whoops! Squashed it.

167
00:26:29,137 --> 00:26:31,472
Ew! It smells!

168
00:26:31,514 --> 00:26:33,975
You squeezed too hard.

169
00:27:01,794 --> 00:27:04,923
There are millions of them!

170
00:27:17,685 --> 00:27:20,688
Setsuko, close your eyes
and say "ah".

171
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:21,856
Why?

172
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,025
Just do it.
"Ah..."

173
00:27:36,037 --> 00:27:38,206
Fruit drop!

174
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:41,835
Fruit drop! Fruit drop!

175
00:27:52,846 --> 00:27:55,640
I almost swallowed it.

176
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,658
We are home.

177
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,493
Where were you?

178
00:28:18,037 --> 00:28:19,998
Did you thank
the lady?

179
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:21,875
Yes ma'am.

180
00:28:24,377 --> 00:28:27,130
That food looked good...

181
00:28:55,283 --> 00:28:59,162
Seita. Shouldn't you be
going to school. Or something?

182
00:29:00,246 --> 00:29:04,834
Yeah, but the steelworks they
had me working in was bombed.

183
00:29:04,959 --> 00:29:08,505
And my school burned down.
There's no place to go.

184
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:12,175
Well, I hope you have
written to your father.

185
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:15,553
I already sent a letter
through the Naval Office.

186
00:29:15,637 --> 00:29:17,013
When?

187
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:19,807
Just after we came here...
About 10 days ago?

188
00:29:21,142 --> 00:29:23,478
That's strange...

189
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,814
There should have been
a reply by now.

190
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,319
Return the scissors when you have
finished with them, Setsuko.

191
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:41,579
How's the
war effort?

192
00:29:41,704 --> 00:29:44,332
It's starting
to look hopeless.

193
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,003
The more factories we lose,
the harder the others have to work.

194
00:29:49,379 --> 00:29:52,465
We are getting ready for
when they finally invade.

195
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:58,096
You are right. That's why food's
getting so hard to find.

196
00:30:00,223 --> 00:30:03,351
Our soldiers aren't the
only ones who are suffering.

197
00:30:05,478 --> 00:30:08,940
You work for our country's
defense too, young lady.

198
00:30:09,482 --> 00:30:12,610
You eat up and work as
hard as you can!

199
00:30:20,368 --> 00:30:21,452
Not again...

200
00:30:22,078 --> 00:30:24,831
So you have taken in a couple
of homeless children?

201
00:30:24,873 --> 00:30:30,753
Poor things... To lose their
mother when they are so young.

202
00:30:31,546 --> 00:30:33,339
What's wrong?
Itch?

203
00:30:33,423 --> 00:30:36,634
It's hot.
I hate shelters!

204
00:30:36,676 --> 00:30:40,180
Just hang on. Don't worry,
I'm here for you.

205
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:53,109
Wanna go to
the beach?

206
00:30:53,193 --> 00:30:55,862
Yeah! Yeah!
Let's go!

207
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:13,755
It's all
vegetable fields now.

208
00:32:11,855 --> 00:32:14,023
What are they doing?

209
00:32:14,107 --> 00:32:16,025
Making sea salt.

210
00:32:16,109 --> 00:32:19,070
It's because all the salt
and soy sauce is rationed.

211
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:22,282
Hurry up, Setsuko!

212
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:53,104
It might be a
little cold...

213
00:32:53,188 --> 00:32:54,898
Cold!

214
00:32:57,025 --> 00:33:00,195
Feels good, right?
You won't itch now.

215
00:33:07,994 --> 00:33:10,622
It's a big bathtub!

216
00:33:10,663 --> 00:33:12,165
HEY!

217
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:19,756
Come back here!

218
00:33:24,385 --> 00:33:27,764
Grrr, I'm a bear!
I'm gonna eat you!

219
00:33:50,829 --> 00:33:54,207
Snip... Snip... Snip...

220
00:33:58,628 --> 00:34:01,798
What's wrong?
ls he sleeping?

221
00:34:10,473 --> 00:34:13,393
Don't look at that.

222
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:18,398
When it gets a little warmer,
I will teach you how to swim.

223
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:23,611
We will swim,
and that will make us hungry.

224
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,410
We will swim,
and that will make us hungry.

225
00:34:38,835 --> 00:34:40,420
Seita!

226
00:34:40,503 --> 00:34:44,090
Setsuko! Come on!

227
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:55,852
You are hungry, aren't you?
There's food here for you.

228
00:35:26,466 --> 00:35:31,179
Mother! Were you waiting long?
It's good to see you again.

229
00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:33,765
Are you all right here?

230
00:35:33,806 --> 00:35:37,352
I'm fine. Don't worry!
They are very nice here.

231
00:35:37,393 --> 00:35:39,312
I'm hungry.

232
00:35:41,689 --> 00:35:43,816
Let's get home before we are
caught in the raid.

233
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,987
I'm tired... Carry me.

234
00:35:50,198 --> 00:35:51,991
Air raid!

235
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:06,548
Your mother won't be
needing her kimono anymore.

236
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:09,300
Why don't you trade
them for some rice.

237
00:36:09,342 --> 00:36:14,639
I have been trading off my
things bit by bit for food.

238
00:36:15,348 --> 00:36:18,059
You can probably get a
full bowl of rice for them.

239
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:19,435
That much?

240
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:21,813
You need your
nourishment.

241
00:36:21,896 --> 00:36:24,816
You can't be a soldier if
you don't grow up healthy.

242
00:36:24,899 --> 00:36:26,818
A whole bowl of rice?

243
00:36:26,901 --> 00:36:30,947
Your mother would be glad you
didn't let them just go to waste.

244
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:33,533
Why don't I take them?

245
00:36:34,534 --> 00:36:35,994
NO!

246
00:36:36,077 --> 00:36:37,996
Setsuko.
You are awake?

247
00:36:38,037 --> 00:36:42,834
No! No!
They are Mama's!

248
00:36:42,917 --> 00:36:45,962
They are Mama's!
Don't take them!

249
00:36:46,546 --> 00:36:48,798
Setsuko...
Let them go!

250
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:55,263
Setsuko... Setsuko...

251
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:37,805
Fine rice, isn't it?

252
00:37:39,098 --> 00:37:43,019
We will have a proper rice
dinner tonight, Setsuko.

253
00:37:45,522 --> 00:37:48,191
Here, this is yours.

254
00:37:55,824 --> 00:37:58,409
White rice, Setsuko!

255
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:11,673
Here you go.

256
00:38:12,173 --> 00:38:15,134
With my daughter and our lodger
working overtime so much...

257
00:38:15,176 --> 00:38:18,137
...l have felt bad not having
rice to give them.

258
00:38:19,514 --> 00:38:22,058
It's great, huh?
Real white rice!

259
00:38:25,812 --> 00:38:27,313
More!

260
00:38:27,355 --> 00:38:29,357
Yes, yes...

261
00:38:32,527 --> 00:38:35,405
You are just gobbling it down
tonight, aren't you Setsuko?

262
00:38:35,488 --> 00:38:37,323
It's good!

263
00:38:42,871 --> 00:38:44,414
What's wrong?

264
00:38:44,497 --> 00:38:47,167
I don't want
rice porridge!

265
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:50,044
Don't we have any more
pickled plums?

266
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:53,298
We finished
those off ages ago.

267
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:55,967
Here's
your lunch.

268
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:57,802
Thanks. I'd better
get going.

269
00:38:57,886 --> 00:38:59,262
See you.

270
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:02,390
Bye.

271
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:03,766
Take care.

272
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:07,103
We will have rice balls for lunch.
Just hold on till then.

273
00:39:07,187 --> 00:39:11,149
Stop that!
You will have it for lunch too!

274
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:14,819
You think a lazy
slug like you deserves...

275
00:39:14,861 --> 00:39:18,156
...the same as people who
work for our nation?!

276
00:39:20,533 --> 00:39:25,163
Seita, you are old enough to
know everyone has to cooperate.

277
00:39:26,372 --> 00:39:29,250
You keep saying you want rice,
but do you earn it?

278
00:39:29,375 --> 00:39:33,129
No, you absolutely do not!

279
00:39:42,764 --> 00:39:47,685
I even give you some rice,
and you still complain!

280
00:39:47,727 --> 00:39:50,188
But it's our rice.

281
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:53,691
Oh, so now I'm
cheating you, am l?

282
00:39:53,733 --> 00:39:59,364
How dare you say that!
After I take you two in!

283
00:40:00,532 --> 00:40:06,955
Fine! We will just make our
OWN dinners from now on!

284
00:40:06,996 --> 00:40:11,334
Seita, you have other
relatives in Tokyo, don't you?

285
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:14,337
On your mother's
side of the family?

286
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:20,051
Why not write to them?
WE could be bombed any day!

287
00:40:20,134 --> 00:40:22,804
Problem is,
I don't know their address...

288
00:40:31,771 --> 00:40:32,981
Let's
go home.

289
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:36,693
Uh-huh. Papa's
waiting for us.

290
00:40:36,776 --> 00:40:41,364
Frogs are singing,
it's time to go home.

291
00:40:44,576 --> 00:40:47,162
Sorry you had to
wait so long.

292
00:40:51,499 --> 00:40:52,959
What's wrong?

293
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:56,296
I'm hungry.
And I'm thirsty too.

294
00:40:56,337 --> 00:40:57,922
Okay...

295
00:41:01,801 --> 00:41:04,345
Here, have a fruit drop.

296
00:41:05,847 --> 00:41:08,850
Mom has 7000 yen in the bank.

297
00:41:09,267 --> 00:41:14,856
7000... That's enough to
live on, so don't worry.

298
00:41:17,108 --> 00:41:22,530
I'm telling Dad to write back
soon, because you are waiting.

1
00:41:33,168 --> 00:41:35,046
You are in luck.

2
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:40,387
You can't buy a stove like
this easily nowadays.

3
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:46,645
It's almost impossible to
find any hardware to sell.

4
00:41:48,857 --> 00:41:52,486
I will take that comb, and...
Do you have an umbrella?

5
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,325
An umbrella... Oh yes!

6
00:41:56,409 --> 00:41:59,371
It's raining, it's raining.

7
00:41:59,413 --> 00:42:06,548
Big brother's coming home
with an umbrella just for me.

8
00:42:06,631 --> 00:42:10,720
Drip-drop, plip-plop.
Down the rain comes!

9
00:42:22,653 --> 00:42:24,615
That's got it!

10
00:42:24,656 --> 00:42:26,283
Be careful
with that fire.

11
00:42:26,367 --> 00:42:28,328
Right...

12
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:33,210
What are they up to?

13
00:42:33,293 --> 00:42:35,546
They are doing their own cooking.

14
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:39,719
Good for them! More please.

15
00:42:39,803 --> 00:42:42,598
Mother, did you scold them again?

16
00:42:43,057 --> 00:42:46,019
Yes, but they refuse to apologize.

17
00:42:46,061 --> 00:42:50,234
And that boy even bought a
stove. Just to spite me!

18
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,321
Finished!

19
00:42:57,284 --> 00:42:59,579
Bad manners, Seita.

20
00:43:01,124 --> 00:43:04,044
Doesn't matter.
We can sit any way we want.

21
00:43:14,183 --> 00:43:15,685
Rice for two.

22
00:43:15,768 --> 00:43:17,354
That's it?

23
00:43:17,438 --> 00:43:20,358
Next ration will be in July.

24
00:44:57,159 --> 00:44:59,120
Let me!

25
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:25,531
Like it?

26
00:45:31,749 --> 00:45:34,586
It's all different tastes!

27
00:45:34,669 --> 00:45:38,925
Grape, strawberry, melon, mint.
All in there.

28
00:45:38,966 --> 00:45:41,136
Drink it all.

29
00:45:50,191 --> 00:45:52,568
All gone.

30
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:59,912
Great...
Left the dishes for me to do.

31
00:46:00,412 --> 00:46:02,582
So selfish...

32
00:46:02,666 --> 00:46:05,586
Honestly! Those brats are
two of the worst!

33
00:46:07,714 --> 00:46:08,716
Not again!

34
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,426
Mama!
Mama!

35
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:14,266
Seita, my daughter and that
man work for our nation!

36
00:46:14,307 --> 00:46:17,478
We can't have her crying
keep them awake.

37
00:46:17,562 --> 00:46:23,027
We have enough trouble getting
sleep with the air raids!

38
00:46:49,939 --> 00:46:53,945
Report from Central
Military Division.

39
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:59,244
Several waves of enemy
bombers are approaching.

40
00:46:59,286 --> 00:47:02,248
Going to the
shelter again, Seita?

41
00:47:02,332 --> 00:47:06,546
You are old enough to help
fight the fires, aren't you?

42
00:47:17,728 --> 00:47:23,361
I want to go home.
I hate living with her!

43
00:47:24,947 --> 00:47:28,117
We don't have
a house to go back to.

44
00:47:41,845 --> 00:47:45,767
With a great big streamer
shaped like a carp...

45
00:47:45,851 --> 00:47:49,982
...and longer than a house.

46
00:47:50,065 --> 00:47:56,448
The big one's the Papa,
the little ones the kids.

47
00:47:56,532 --> 00:48:00,203
Stop it! Don't you realize
there's a war going on?!

48
00:48:00,328 --> 00:48:03,000
You two are nothing
but trouble for me!

49
00:48:04,877 --> 00:48:07,797
A couple of pests,
that's what you are!

50
00:48:07,881 --> 00:48:11,761
You are no help
at all during the raids.

51
00:48:11,803 --> 00:48:15,892
You could just go and LIVE in
that shelter for all I care!

52
00:48:18,813 --> 00:48:20,356
That's it.

53
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:23,360
We will live here.

54
00:48:25,197 --> 00:48:30,329
No one uses it. It's sturdy.
We can live like we want!

55
00:48:30,412 --> 00:48:33,500
Can we really live here?!

56
00:48:57,324 --> 00:49:00,788
We have bothered you long enough.
We are leaving now.

57
00:49:00,829 --> 00:49:03,333
Leaving...? For where?

58
00:49:03,416 --> 00:49:06,337
Haven't really decided yet.

59
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:11,553
Well, take care of yourselves.
Bye-bye, Setsuko!

60
00:49:32,123 --> 00:49:34,751
This will be the kitchen!

61
00:49:36,712 --> 00:49:39,132
This will be the front door!

62
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:43,638
Where's the bathroom?

63
00:49:45,016 --> 00:49:49,021
That can be anywhere.
Wanna go somewhere with me?

64
00:49:58,492 --> 00:49:59,911
Thanks for
the wagon.

65
00:49:59,994 --> 00:50:02,247
Just leave
it there.

66
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:08,798
Do you think you can sell
us some food and straw?

67
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:12,803
I guess.
Not much left, though.

68
00:51:07,629 --> 00:51:09,090
My mouth's
watering!

69
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:10,633
Man, am I
hungry.

70
00:51:37,338 --> 00:51:39,925
Well, we can always eat frogs.

71
00:51:40,008 --> 00:51:41,551
Frogs?

72
00:51:41,635 --> 00:51:43,930
They are great.

1
00:51:47,517 --> 00:51:50,355
You'd better get under
the mosquito net.

2
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:00,995
What's wrong?

3
00:52:01,078 --> 00:52:03,330
I forgot my
toothbrush.

4
00:52:03,415 --> 00:52:06,335
One night without it
won't matter.

5
00:52:08,964 --> 00:52:13,344
It's getting buggy.
You'd better get under the net.

6
00:52:13,428 --> 00:52:16,348
It's dark in there.
I'm scared.

7
00:52:20,855 --> 00:52:23,776
I have to take a leak.
How about you?

8
00:52:28,991 --> 00:52:31,578
A kamikaze.

9
00:52:31,703 --> 00:52:33,623
It looks like
a firefly.

10
00:52:33,706 --> 00:52:35,626
Yeah...

11
00:52:36,627 --> 00:52:38,546
Let's catch some.

12
00:52:40,091 --> 00:52:41,967
Okay, get in.

13
00:52:55,277 --> 00:52:57,656
I can see you!

14
00:52:57,739 --> 00:52:59,283
I can see you, too.

15
00:53:02,287 --> 00:53:04,666
A hair clip.

16
00:53:08,922 --> 00:53:12,635
Okay, let's get
as many as we can!

17
00:54:05,792 --> 00:54:10,089
I went to a naval review, once.
Before you were born.

18
00:54:10,173 --> 00:54:12,051
Naval review...?

19
00:54:12,092 --> 00:54:17,391
Uh-huh. Dad's cruiser, the "Maya",
was in formation with the fleet.

20
00:54:54,818 --> 00:54:58,991
Mighty fortresses
floating on the seas...

21
00:54:59,074 --> 00:55:03,079
Defending our homeland from
invaders near and far.

22
00:55:03,121 --> 00:55:05,082
Enemy plane!

23
00:55:15,847 --> 00:55:19,728
I wonder where
Dad is fighting now...

24
00:55:48,267 --> 00:55:51,021
Get off me, Seita!

25
00:56:29,366 --> 00:56:30,701
What are you doing?

26
00:56:30,784 --> 00:56:35,249
Making a grave.
Mama's in a grave too.

27
00:56:40,506 --> 00:56:43,427
Auntie told me.

28
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:48,058
She said Mama died,
and she's in a grave now.

29
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:21,103
We will visit her grave sometime.

30
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:26,444
Do you remember the graveyard,
the one near Nunobiki?

31
00:57:26,528 --> 00:57:32,119
That's where she is.
Under a big camphor tree...

32
00:57:32,203 --> 00:57:36,250
Why do fireflies
have to die so soon?

33
00:58:14,511 --> 00:58:17,015
Hey, it looks like
some body's living here.

34
00:58:17,098 --> 00:58:19,393
Probably lost
their house.

35
00:58:19,476 --> 00:58:21,938
Maybe it's some
crazy hermit.

36
00:58:22,981 --> 00:58:24,734
It's a swing.

37
00:58:24,775 --> 00:58:26,737
A kid lives here.
What's this?

38
00:58:27,571 --> 00:58:29,782
Rest in Peace!

39
00:58:31,994 --> 00:58:34,497
Wish it was real food.

40
00:58:35,707 --> 00:58:37,793
It says
"Setsuko".

41
00:58:37,877 --> 00:58:40,130
Look!
Dried frogs!

42
00:58:40,172 --> 00:58:42,634
Who'd wanna eat that?!

43
00:58:42,717 --> 00:58:46,805
Nobody I know would
ever eat this stuff!

44
00:58:49,059 --> 00:58:52,605
Ground soybeans! And I thought
the food I got was bad!

45
00:58:52,647 --> 00:58:54,942
A ghost!

46
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:09,754
I have traded everything for
rice. Even my Mom's kimono.

47
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:12,216
There's nothing left to trade.

48
00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:15,262
Please, I can pay you
money for the rice...

49
00:59:16,764 --> 00:59:20,227
Sorry. I can't trade or
sell anything to you.

50
00:59:20,269 --> 00:59:24,566
I'm a farmer, but even I
don't have any rice to share.

51
00:59:31,994 --> 00:59:33,704
Don't you have
other relatives?

52
00:59:33,787 --> 00:59:35,873
I can't
contact them.

53
00:59:36,207 --> 00:59:40,088
Then take my advice and
go back to that woman.

54
00:59:40,422 --> 00:59:43,509
Every thing's rationed now.

55
00:59:43,634 --> 00:59:46,430
You can't survive
outside of the system.

56
00:59:47,139 --> 00:59:50,059
Just swallow your pride
and apologize to her.

57
00:59:56,235 --> 00:59:59,531
Thanks anyway.
I will ask someone else.

58
01:00:00,908 --> 01:00:04,788
You are a navy man's son, right?
Try to be brave.

59
01:00:36,791 --> 01:00:38,710
Should we?

60
01:01:17,931 --> 01:01:19,851
Uh-oh!



133
01:02:19,684 --> 01:02:22,563
It doesn't matter if you like
it or not. You have to eat!

134
01:02:22,646 --> 01:02:25,400
You need to,
so you can grow up!

135
01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:27,528
Seita...

136
01:02:29,198 --> 01:02:34,371
I- I feel funny.

137
01:02:34,455 --> 01:02:36,791
Are you cold?

138
01:02:36,875 --> 01:02:40,296
I have been having diarrhea...

1
01:02:43,844 --> 01:02:45,304
Why you-- !

2
01:02:46,848 --> 01:02:48,518
I'm sorry!

3
01:02:49,227 --> 01:02:52,898
Sir, forgive me!
I didn't mean to.

4
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:56,529
My sister's sick. I just
wanted to get her some sugar!

5
01:02:56,612 --> 01:03:01,243
Yeah, sure! Stealing food's
a serious crime in wartime!

6
01:03:02,662 --> 01:03:05,541
You god damned-- !
Come back here!

7
01:03:17,224 --> 01:03:19,768
What the hell...?!
Potatoes too?!

8
01:03:20,895 --> 01:03:23,899
So YOU'RE the one who's
been stealing around here!

9
01:03:23,941 --> 01:03:25,902
Seita!

10
01:03:26,278 --> 01:03:30,450
I'm sorry! I will never
do it again, I swear!

11
01:03:30,534 --> 01:03:33,538
Tell it to the cops!
I will take you there myself!

12
01:03:33,621 --> 01:03:37,168
Now walk!
I hope they lock you up!

13
01:03:37,251 --> 01:03:41,465
Please, she's sick!
She needs me!

14
01:03:41,507 --> 01:03:44,678
Seita!

15
01:03:44,761 --> 01:03:46,848
SEITA!

16
01:03:48,601 --> 01:03:51,813
Seita...

17
01:03:56,612 --> 01:04:00,867
The nature of the crime
is fairly clear, I think.

18
01:04:00,909 --> 01:04:04,748
Thank you, I will handle this.
You may go.

19
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:07,501
But officer...

20
01:04:07,585 --> 01:04:11,465
You have knocked this
poor kid around enough.

21
01:04:11,548 --> 01:04:16,388
I'm even tempted to call it...
ASSAULT!

22
01:04:16,430 --> 01:04:19,184
I... er...
Thank you officer!

23
01:04:22,523 --> 01:04:25,443
They hit Fukui tonight.

24
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:31,493
Would you like
a glass of water?

25
01:04:41,298 --> 01:04:42,716
Setsuko...

26
01:04:50,477 --> 01:04:51,896
Seita!

27
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:09,838
Seita...

28
01:05:16,722 --> 01:05:22,522
Where does it hurt?
Should I get a doctor?

29
01:05:28,363 --> 01:05:29,823
Setsuko!

30
01:05:38,127 --> 01:05:41,048
Seita, I have to
go to the bathroom.

31
01:05:44,552 --> 01:05:46,847
Can it wait?

32
01:05:47,681 --> 01:05:49,601
Hop on.

33
01:05:56,486 --> 01:06:03,245
Brother's gone to the mountain
to bring back some firewood...

34
01:06:52,605 --> 01:06:54,524
Setsuko. Dinner.

35
01:06:58,029 --> 01:07:02,994
This pumpkin's great.
Tastes just like sweet bean jelly.

36
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:05,664
Don't like that stuff.

37
01:07:05,748 --> 01:07:10,880
Look, if you don't eat,
Dad will blame ME for it.

38
01:07:10,963 --> 01:07:14,802
Come on, I will even help you.
Now cheer up and eat!

39
01:07:16,387 --> 01:07:21,311
Once you get better, I will take
you to the beach again.



178
01:08:57,735 --> 01:09:00,697
Now I will really get you
something good to eat, Setsuko!

1
01:09:09,944 --> 01:09:11,363
Seita...

2
01:09:17,789 --> 01:09:19,165
Seita...

3
01:09:20,918 --> 01:09:24,005
These were your mother's?
Don't make me laugh!

4
01:09:24,089 --> 01:09:28,804
Don't try to pawn off
this garbage on me!

5
01:09:37,941 --> 01:09:41,321
Setsuko...

6
01:10:08,567 --> 01:10:09,526
Setsuko!

7
01:10:17,621 --> 01:10:21,084
Seita... Water...

8
01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:33,560
Breathe in.

9
01:10:33,643 --> 01:10:35,646
And out.

10
01:10:37,899 --> 01:10:41,696
She's been having
diarrhea for a while now.

11
01:10:41,738 --> 01:10:47,120
Prickly heat... Rashes...
And salt water hurts her skin.

12
01:10:50,041 --> 01:10:55,048
Weakening from malnutrition.
Probably due to the diarrhea.

13
01:10:55,173 --> 01:10:56,634
Next?

14
01:10:56,717 --> 01:10:59,011
Can you give her
medicine? A shot?

15
01:10:59,053 --> 01:11:00,931
Don't wanna
shot.

16
01:11:01,014 --> 01:11:04,102
Please doctor, help her!

17
01:11:04,185 --> 01:11:09,610
Medicine...
All this child needs is food.

18
01:11:09,693 --> 01:11:11,821
Food...

19
01:11:12,531 --> 01:11:13,698
What's wrong?

20
01:11:13,740 --> 01:11:16,536
Where do
I GET food?!

21
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:09,902
Boy am I hungry.
What do you want to eat?

22
01:12:09,985 --> 01:12:15,618
Tempura... Sashimi...
Jelly...

23
01:12:15,659 --> 01:12:16,911
Anything else?

24
01:12:16,994 --> 01:12:20,458
Ice cream... And also...

25
01:12:21,459 --> 01:12:23,754
I want fruit drops...

26
01:12:24,171 --> 01:12:27,175
Drops... Okay!

27
01:12:30,806 --> 01:12:34,435
I will withdraw the money and
buy you all the food you need.

28
01:12:34,477 --> 01:12:39,234
Don't want anything...
You can have it...

29
01:12:39,317 --> 01:12:45,242
Don't go! Stay with me!
Don't leave me alone!

30
01:12:45,951 --> 01:12:48,747
Don't worry, Setsuko.

31
01:12:48,789 --> 01:12:52,961
I will buy you some good,
nourishing food.

32
01:12:53,002 --> 01:12:58,260
And I will never leave you again.
Never, ever again.

33
01:13:00,471 --> 01:13:02,432
I promise.

34
01:13:23,879 --> 01:13:25,173
3000 yen.

35
01:13:25,256 --> 01:13:27,175
There's a
typhoon coming?

36
01:13:27,258 --> 01:13:32,599
Great, we get our "divine wind"
AFTER we surrender. Figures...

37
01:13:32,724 --> 01:13:36,104
Surrender...?
We have lost the war?!

38
01:13:36,146 --> 01:13:38,608
Haven't you heard?

39
01:13:42,070 --> 01:13:45,366
Japan's lost?
The Great Japanese Empire?

40
01:13:45,450 --> 01:13:48,370
Yeah...
Surrendered unconditionally.

41
01:13:49,581 --> 01:13:51,459
What about
the fleet?

42
01:13:51,501 --> 01:13:52,543
All gone.

43
01:13:52,585 --> 01:13:56,256
Sent to the bottom.
Not one left afloat.

44
01:13:56,298 --> 01:13:57,592
WHAT?!

45
01:13:57,675 --> 01:14:02,057
Was my Dad's ship sunk too?!
ls that why he hasn't written?!

46
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:06,771
How should I know?
Crazy kid...

47
01:14:10,944 --> 01:14:12,655
Damn him!

48
01:14:28,385 --> 01:14:30,930
I'm so hungry...

49
01:14:36,104 --> 01:14:37,939
Dad...

50
01:14:45,366 --> 01:14:50,123
Now Dad's gone too...
He's dead too...

51
01:14:52,251 --> 01:14:53,837
Dad...



230
01:15:37,204 --> 01:15:41,961
Sorry I'm so late.
I will make you some rice.

231
01:15:42,837 --> 01:15:44,798
Up they go...

232
01:15:46,258 --> 01:15:48,177
And down again...

233
01:15:51,265 --> 01:15:53,810
Oh... Firefly's stopped...

234
01:15:53,893 --> 01:15:56,814
I bought us
some chicken and eggs.

235
01:15:59,109 --> 01:16:01,028
And also...

236
01:16:09,415 --> 01:16:11,835
Setsuko, what's in your mouth?!

237
01:16:15,549 --> 01:16:18,636
This is a marble.
It isn't a drop!

238
01:16:21,223 --> 01:16:25,187
I brought you something
I know you like.

239
01:16:28,233 --> 01:16:31,196
Seita... Have one...

240
01:16:35,910 --> 01:16:37,829
Setsuko... What's...?

241
01:16:37,913 --> 01:16:40,082
Rice balls...

242
01:16:41,627 --> 01:16:44,422
I made them for you...

243
01:16:46,257 --> 01:16:49,053
Here... Have one...

244
01:16:53,601 --> 01:16:56,146
You don't want them...?

245
01:16:56,271 --> 01:16:57,482
Setsuko!

246
01:17:06,911 --> 01:17:10,834
Look, it's a watermelon.
I didn't steal it, either.

247
01:17:22,850 --> 01:17:25,646
Here, eat it.

248
01:17:32,947 --> 01:17:34,908
It's good...

249
01:17:39,039 --> 01:17:43,044
Hold on, I will make you some
rice gruel with eggs.

250
01:17:50,263 --> 01:17:53,058
I will leave the
melon here for you.

251
01:17:54,143 --> 01:17:56,563
Okay?

252
01:17:56,646 --> 01:18:01,111
Seita... Thank you...

253
01:18:25,646 --> 01:18:29,400
She never woke up.

254
01:19:21,472 --> 01:19:24,310
There.
Charcoal for the cremation.

255
01:19:24,393 --> 01:19:27,939
Since it's a child,
you should do it at a temple.

256
01:19:28,566 --> 01:19:33,781
The body should be lightly dressed.
Use beanstalks for a good fire.

257
01:19:33,865 --> 01:19:36,869
Beautiful day,
in spite of it all.

258
01:19:42,043 --> 01:19:46,382
It hasn't changed a bit.
It's good to be home!

259
01:19:50,262 --> 01:19:53,266
Look! The old phonograph...

260
01:19:57,314 --> 01:19:59,984
I have missed this view.

261
01:20:45,839 --> 01:20:47,967
Come back soon!

262
01:24:25,830 --> 01:24:28,630
<i>The next morning, I put some
of Setsuko's ashes into...</i>

263
01:24:28,630 --> 01:24:31,800
<i>...the candy tin, and then
climbed down the hill.</i>

264
01:24:33,050 --> 01:24:35,220
<i>I never went back to the shelter.</i>

265
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:43,970
Seita...

266
01:25:01,490 --> 01:25:03,040
Time for bed. Okay?
