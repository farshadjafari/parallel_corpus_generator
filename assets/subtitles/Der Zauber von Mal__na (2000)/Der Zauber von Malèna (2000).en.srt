3
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,000
This afternoon at 5:00.

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,000
II Duce will speak to the nation!

5
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,900
You are ordered
to turn your radios on!

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,700
AII of you who have radio sets
and radio gramophones...

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,900
are ordered to turn them on.

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,700
Mussolini will speak to

9
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,400
all Italians!

10
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,000
You are authorized by order
of the Fascist government...

11
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,100
to interrupt your work.
This afternoon at 5:00...
II Duce will speak to the nation.

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,300
I was twelve and a half
when I saw her for the first time.

13
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,600
and my mind plays tricks on me,
I remember it well.

14
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,700
That day, Mussolini declared war
on France and Great Britain...

15
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,600
and I got my first bicycle.

16
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,000
The frame is British, the gears are German,

17
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,900
the pedals are French,

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,800
and the brakes are from...
I forget.

19
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,100
But the chain is Sicilian...
always keep it greasy.

20
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,600
Are you sure it's safe?

21
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,300
I have new bikes too.

22
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,700
Mimi, we're at war.
Who can afford a new bicycle?

23
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,000
Fighting men,

24
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,900
on land, on sea and in the air,

25
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,800
Black shirts of the revolution,

26
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,100
men and women of Italy...

27
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,300
and the Kingdom of Albania, hearth is...

28
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,900
The hour...

29
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,100
of decisions from which

30
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,300
there is no return.

31
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,000
Pino, think this ant knows he's dead meat?

32
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,000
Who knows?

33
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,900
If he's like you, he doesn't know shit.

34
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,900
The declaration of war...

35
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,600
has already been delivered to the ambassadors.

36
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,100
I'm free from misery.
Mary's son is my Lord.

37
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,800
I'm free from misery.
Mary's son is my Lord.

38
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,000
Hey, guys!

39
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,800
Lucky bastard.

40
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,800
-he got a new bicycle!
-Man, she's beautiful!

41
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,400
Custom-made, just like the racers.

42
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,200
-Now you're a man, like us.
-So I can join the gang?

43
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,300
-''Don Agostino''?
-Okay by me.

44
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,000
-''Don NicoIa''?
-I'd let him in.

45
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,200
-''Don Tonino''?
-Sure.

46
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:26,200
-And you, ''Don Sasa''?
-I don't want some kid poking into our business.

47
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,000
-Why? What are you doing?
-Can you keep your mouth shut?

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,700
She's coming!

49
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,400
What's going on?

50
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:46,300
If you wanna be one of us,
just shut up and watch.

51
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,500
-Who is she?
-The deaf guy's daughter, our new Latin teacher.

52
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,900
-What's her name?
-What a wonderful ass!

53
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,400
What I wouldn’t give for an hour with her!

54
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,300
-Too bad she's married.
-If she weren't...

55
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,900
What's her name?

56
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,900
Malena, the most beautiful ass
in CasteIcuto.

57
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,400
The sun is bigger than the moon.

58
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,500
Or soImaiorestIuna.

59
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,500
Can I screw your daughter,
you deaf old fart?

60
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,200
Yes, but hurry.

61
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,900
I love honesty more than wealth.

62
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,900
-Seven thumbs long!
-Seven and a half thumbs!

63
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,100
-Mine's a bazooka!
-I got eight!

64
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:08,000
Eight is nothing!
That's just ticking a woman.

65
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,500
One, two...three and two is five,
two is seven and two is nine.

66
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,000
Torpedo!

67
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,100
My submarine will rip Malena in half!

68
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,100
Once I skipped school
and went by Malena's house.

69
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,100
She was at the window,
and she called out to me.

70
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,100
I thought she wanted me
to get her some cigarettes.

71
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,000
I went up for the money,
and her robe fell open.

72
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,400
And there she was...
naked as the day she was born.

73
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,300
Holy shit! She did it
on purpose to excite me.

74
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:42,000
I was an idiot.
I should have jumped at the chance.

75
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,300
If it happens again,
I'II bang her brains out.

76
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,000
She'd quit smoking first.
She knows you've got no balls.

77
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,100
You little runt, you've been
here for two hours...

78
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,100
and you still haven't measured yourself.

79
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,300
Measure it!

80
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,100
One, two,

81
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,300
three, four, five...

82
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,700
Only six!

83
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,400
You know what they say
about a kid in short pants?

84
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,300
Short pants: short dick!

85
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,100
Fuck off. My thumbs are
twice as big as yours!

86
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,300
Bullshit!

87
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,600
-Who's got the biggest dick now, runt?
-You do!

88
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,800
No, I am II Duce!
Nobody's bigger than me!

89
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,300
-Ooh. Renato's skipping school.
-Shh!

90
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,100
You, come here!
I need some cigarettes.

91
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,800
What cigarettes do you want?

92
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,800
Macedonia Extra.

93
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,400
I remember this suit very well.
It's your father's.

94
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,400
I sewed it 20 years ago,
and it still looks brand-new.

95
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,200
He only wore it to his wedding.
He wants to keep it for his funeral.

96
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,600
If he's buried in this suit,
he'll go straight to heaven!

97
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,000
My father's still young.

98
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,200
And you're too young
for long pants.

99
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,400
I didn't ask for your opinion, sir.

100
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,800
-Does he know about this?
-Of course he does!

101
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,300
You little scoundrel,
what the hell is this?

102
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:34,200
Come here, mister.
So you want to skip school?

103
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,600
Fine. Who didn't at your age?

104
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,500
-Leave him alone!
-I know what I'm doing.

105
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,300
And you let your friends beat you up.

106
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,800
Even though when I was your age,
I'd beat my friends up!

107
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,200
But stealing trousers from your father...

108
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,400
and getting them altered for yourself
is just plain wrong.

109
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,800
But, Papa, you don't understand!

110
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,800
Understand?
Who said you could speak?

111
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,200
I'm ashamed to wear short pants!

112
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,400
What about knickers?
They're almost long pants!

113
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,200
Enough!
He's still a child!

114
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:13,800
I'II tell our party secretary you won't
Let me go to the Fascist exercises!

115
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,300
Let's make a deal.

116
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:26,500
The day someone cracks the skull
of ''Our Great Leader,''

117
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,400
then you'll get long pants.

118
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,700
Swear it.

119
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,500
A beautiful young woman
all alone here. It's a crime.

120
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,500
-Who's he talking about?
-Malena Scordia, Nino's sexy new wife.

121
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,400
She must have somebody
on the side... it's inevitable!

122
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,500
-Number fifteen!
-Me.

123
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,000
Right. Nino brings her from
her village with her ailing father.

124
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:22,000
And then a month later...
boom... Nino's called to the war.

125
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,600
Who here wants to bet
she's sleeping all alone?

126
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,500
Not me!

127
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,500
Why don't you let me
sit with the others?

128
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,500
You're too young to sit
in the adult chair.

129
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,700
But, son, if you don't know
the title, how can I help you?

130
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,900
It's that pretty, romantic one...

131
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,500
Ma L'Amore No.
Why didn't you say so?

132
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,500
Ten Lire.
Pay at the cashier's.

133
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,000
-Don't you test it?
-What for?

134
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,000
-It might be defective.
-It's brand-new!

135
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,900
Miss Malena, this heart of mine,
on fire, has written so many letters,

136
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,100
and if I didn't have the courage
to send them to you,

137
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,900
it was only because
I didn't want to do you harm.

138
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,000
So forgive me if I dare
to send you this one.

139
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I want you to know that
this town has many gossips...

140
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:44,600
who say bad things about you...
that you have a secret lover.

141
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,900
I know it's not true.
You don't have anyone.

142
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,800
After your husband,
the only man in your life is me.

143
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,100
I have to go.
I'II see you at school tomorrow.

144
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
So long!

145
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,300
Don't get lost!

146
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,900
Mr. Lawyer!
Your newspaper's upside down!

147
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,300
Mind your own fucking business!

148
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,300
Good morning, Signora Malena.
Are you well? How is your father?

149
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:48,800
The show's over!
She's gone now!

150
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,500
I forgot the key.

151
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,900
So it's true what people say!

152
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,100
What's the matter with you?
You look so strange.

153
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,500
You've poisoned me with your lies.

154
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,600
What lies?
I've never spoken to you.

155
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,900
I knew it from the start...
you're a loose woman.

156
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,000
But I've never done anything wrong.

157
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,000
Liar! I've been following
you on my bicycle!

158
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,300
-I know where you went. I know everything!
-No!

159
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,400
-The lawyer, the dentist!
-No, Renato, I love only you!

160
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,000
Liar!

161
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,400
-Amoroso.
-Here!

162
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,500
-Cali.
-Here!

163
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,200
-Costanza.
-Here!

164
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,100
Professor, can I put my dick
between Malena's tits?

165
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,400
Can I put mine in her mouth?

166
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,500
Can I put mine
between her legs?

167
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,200
Okay, but one at a time!

168
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,300
Why didn't she marry
someone from her own village?

169
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,900
I'm sure no one wanted her.

170
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,400
They say she's a seamstress.

171
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,500
But she's so vulgar.

172
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,200
My son says she looks fake.

173
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,100
My husband says he wouldn’t touch
her with a ten-foot pole.

174
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,700
The Baron Bonta's mistress
is much nicer.

175
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,100
At least Gina does everything
in the open.

176
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:56,700
The baron screws her once a week
and then goes back to Palermo.

177
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:00,500
Malena acts so superior.
Like we don't know what she's up to.

178
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,400
Wait and see.
She'll get hers.

179
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,600
The headquarters of
the armed forces communicates...

180
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,200
Our brave and invincible Fighting men
have delivered a powerful blow...

181
00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:00,100
to the faceless war machine
unleashed by the Allies.

182
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:04,300
In order to ensure the continued
strength and vitality...

183
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:09,300
of our forces at the front,

184
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:14,700
all payment of civic pensions...
will again be postponed...

185
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,400
-It's ready.
-Thank you.

186
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,400
Malena.

187
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,700
Right rank!
Eyes front!

188
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,800
Arms out, arms high,
in quick succession!

189
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:55,100
One, two! One, two!

190
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:59,600
Have you heard?
Malena's husband was killed.

191
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,700
Malena is available!

192
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,600
Comrades of CasteIcuto,

193
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,200
we are gathered here today...

194
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,400
to share in the tragic
but honourable mourning...

195
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,800
which has struck our town.

196
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:45,200
To express our deepest condolences...

197
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,800
for the loss of Lt. Nino Scordia...

198
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:52,600
heroically killed in action...
in Northern Africa...

199
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,800
and to his bride Maddalena,

200
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,200
who, stricken with grief,
unfortunately isn't here with us.

201
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:04,700
-She's already out looking!
-She’ll need a warm bed now!

202
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,900
But she is with us in spirit,
because Sicilian women...

203
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,900
with their hardships,
with their sacrifices,

204
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,200
march shoulder to shoulder
with Fighting men!

205
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,500
if our fellow citizen in defence of his country was not a useless

206
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,200
Lt. Cadei is so handsome.

207
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,500
A lucky girl will catch him!

208
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,900
...that will carry us to the
final victory of the Fascist Empire!

209
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,700
For Victory!

210
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,700
Long live II Duce!

211
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,500
From now on I'II be at your side.

212
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,200
Forever. I promise.

213
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,500
Just give me time to grow up.

214
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,000
Now she'll take a lover for sure.

215
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:13,000
Once in the sack,
there's no looking back!

216
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,800
She knows that. She's 27 years old.

217
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,900
She knows her way
around the block!

218
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,600
Cusimano, the dentist,
has gone crazy for her.

219
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,800
One day he was distracted
ass he waked by...

220
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:26,700
and pulled a healthy tooth
instead of the rotten one!

221
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,800
Dentist or not, why haven't
we seen her lately?

222
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,900
Guess she's too busy!

223
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,700
They say she's fooling
around with a shopkeeper in Catania...

224
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,200
with subversive tendencies.

225
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:44,500
Some say Cusimano, the dentist.

226
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:48,800
-A family man. It's disgraceful!
-When you're a born whore...

227
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:53,500
I hear the priest has received
anonymous letters...

228
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,000
saying her lover
is this man, that man.

229
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,800
The voice of the people
is the voice of God!

230
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,800
I can't talk to anyone about
my personal problems.

231
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,700
They're too intimate.

232
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,800
But you seem nice.
I'd like to confide in you.
Every day,
I'II light a candle for you.

233
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,700
But you seem nice.
I'd like to confide in you.
Every day,
I'II light a candle for you.

234
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:50,900
I'II even come to Mass on Sunday.

235
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
But you must protect
Malena Scordia from the town.

236
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:58,600
Yes, the widow... at least for
a few years. Then I'II take over.

237
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:52,700
I am always at your service.

238
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,800
-Renewed condolences, Malena.
-Condolences.

239
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,000
What a piece of ass!

240
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,900
Son of a bitch!

241
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
You little runt!
Come back here!

242
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:35,100
-Can't you sing in Italian?
-Can't you speak German?

243
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,100
Renato, It's late.

244
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,300
Renato, get up.

245
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,700
Monster!

246
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,900
You're a fetishist,

247
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,300
a sadomasochist,
or even worse, a pervert!

248
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,000
-What is that?
-It's just a French hat, Ma!

249
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:25,900
Shame on you!

250
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,100
You shameless girl Can I keep them?

251
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:36,300
What are you looking at?
Get out of here!

252
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,000
Come here, you little pig!

253
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,200
-Goddamn pervert!
-What did I do?

254
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:47,500
You're not permitted to sit
at the table with us, understand?

255
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,100
-Answer me!
-Okay!

256
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:56,900
You no longer have the right
to speak to your sisters, understand?

257
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,400
Lock me up!
I'II show you!

258
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:04,400
You're not to leave this room
until further notice!

259
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,100
Son, at least have some soup.
It will do you good.

260
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,100
Pietro, he hasn't eaten
for three days.

261
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,900
In the Soviet Union,
they never eat.

262
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,000
Still... What is this shit?

263
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:22,100
The Fascists gave it to us.
At least it looks like coffee.

264
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,900
Sure, and I look
Like Vittorio De Sica.

265
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,800
Everything they give us is terrible!

266
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,900
Look at these pockets.
They're always ripping open!

267
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,300
This cheap thread
doesn't hold the stitches!

268
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,300
The thread isn't the problem!

269
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:37,400
While our son recites poetry,
his hands go to work in his pockets!

270
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:40,300
What does that mean?

271
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,900
Do you get it now?

272
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,900
Just as well! Don't fix them.
Sew the pockets closed!

273
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,900
But he’ll have no pockets.

274
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,400
He’ll work it out.
It will be good for his health!

275
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:55,600
Lights out!

276
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,000
...that the weary spirit may
ne'er repose in more rest ful harbour...

277
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:04,100
-Has he gone crazy?
-I think he's gone blind.

278
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,300
While upon women's work
you sat intent,

279
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,500
content with the vague future
you held in mind...

280
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,900
was the scented May, and thus
you used to spend your days.

281
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,000
This child needs air.

282
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,100
-Air?
-Air.

283
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,400
Good morning, Professor.

284
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,900
This letter is for you.

285
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,200
It says ''urgent.''

286
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:26,000
You're dishonoured.
Your daughter Malena is sleeping
with the whole town.

287
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,400
It was an anonymous letter,
but I read it!

288
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,100
It says Malena is a whore
with everyone in town!

289
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:51,400
So there's hope for us too!

290
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,900
Take it back!

291
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,500
I'II bust your ass,
Mr. Short Pants!

292
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,200
Tonight was wonderful.

293
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,400
-For me too.
-I know it's been only ten months since.

294
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:49,200
-But maybe I can see you again.
-AII right. You win.

295
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:52,500
-Tomorrow.
-Okay, as long as I'm not on duty.

296
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,200
-Thanks for the flowers.
-You're welcome.

297
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,300
Take care of yourself.

298
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:18,600
So see you tomorrow?

299
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,700
Yes.

300
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,300
-Until then.
-Good night, Leone.

301
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,500
What time?

302
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,100
-Good evening, sir.
-Good evening, my ass!

303
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:36,300
How dare you
pester my fiancée!

304
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,500
There must be a misunderstanding.
I was invited.

305
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,600
You're a liar and a bastard!

306
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:45,000
Because I'm in uniform,
I can not retaliate, sir.

307
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:48,100
-But you will answer to me.
-Anytime.

308
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:54,000
-Coward, scoundrel!
-Get up.

309
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:56,100
Come here!
I'II tear you apart, you coward!

310
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:59,200
I'II break you in two!

311
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,400
Let me go! Or I'II have
to get tough with you!

312
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,600
-Here's the adulterer!
-My wife!

313
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:12,800
-Officer, look! He's cheating on me!
-With a man?

314
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,100
With a traitor!

315
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,600
You said you wouldn’t touch her
with a ten-foot pole!

316
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:19,700
It's the dentist.

317
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,100
I've been spying on you
a long time, you bastard!

318
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,400
And as for you,

319
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,800
go steal husbands from
your own village, you whore!

320
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:44,200
We knew she had one lover, but two?

321
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:47,200
But where does
the dentist fit in?

322
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:48,600
He fits in between her legs!

323
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:52,600
Her father was forced
to quit the school in disgrace.

324
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:55,400
He never wants to see
his daughter Malena again.

325
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,600
And the dentist's wife
kicked him out of his house.

326
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:04,100
That dragon of a wife
will drag him into court!

327
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:07,200
What's the dentist
got to do with it, poor guy?

328
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:10,400
Malena’s the whore!
She should be taken to court!

329
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:13,300
That Lt. Cadei seemed
Like such a gentleman.

330
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,600
How could he get mixed up in this?

331
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:19,000
Everyone knows
she's a home wrecker.

332
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:21,200
The lieutenant was asking for it!

333
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,300
-She's not from here. She forgets where she is.
-Will they go to court?

334
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:30,100
Of course, she could go to jail.
He's a married man!

335
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:34,500
The dentist needed
three stitches in his head.

336
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,900
But the dentist
swore at the soldier first.

337
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,900
That's insulting an officer.

338
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,200
We'll all end up in court!

339
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:45,200
While we were
watching her caboose,

340
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,400
the lieutenant and the dentist
were riding the train!

341
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,600
She's either going
to the lawyer's or the notary's.

342
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:01,400
Sure, but what will she do
with two old men like them?

343
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:05,200
-Excuse me.
-Come in.

344
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,100
Can I help you?

345
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:10,700
May I speak to Lawyer Centorbi?

346
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,600
Please have a seat.

347
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:17,700
Sir, it's the widow Scordia!

348
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:21,600
Can it be true?
Beautiful Madonna!

349
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:33,600
Have her come in.

350
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,600
-Go in.
-Thank you.

351
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,500
Please sit down.

352
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,300
Charmed.

353
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:49,200
We now continue with the testimony
of Maddalena Bonsignore,

354
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,400
the widow Scordia called Malena.

355
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:55,700
She could get two years in prison.

356
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:59,900
Everything will be fine, trust me.

357
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:07,900
Sit down.

358
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:19,600
You're accused of involving
Dr. Gaspare Cusimano...

359
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:23,400
in a secret and
amorous relationship...

360
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,600
aimed at the breaking up
of his family.

361
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:28,500
Do you know Dr. Cusimano?

362
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:30,600
Yes.

363
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:35,400
Are you or have you ever...
been his fiancée?

364
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,800
Absolutely not.

365
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,400
How could I be engaged
to a married man?

366
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:44,100
Why was Cusimano,
at that unusual hour...

367
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,100
on his way to your house?

368
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,300
I don't know.

369
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:51,400
Had he been in your company
on previous evenings?

370
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:08,500
Yes, once.

371
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,900
-Where?
-At my house.

372
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,400
Jumped right in, the dentist did.
He looks stupid, but...

373
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:30,800
-How long did he stay?
-Not long.

374
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:31,900
What did you do?

375
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,300
He brought me some medicine
for my father.

376
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,000
If it was for your father,
why did he bring it to you?

377
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,300
I don't know.

378
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:48,400
What did you do after
he gave you the medicine?

379
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,600
He said good-bye and left.

380
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,600
Then why has Cusimano,
are put able professional,

381
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,500
who, five years ago...

382
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:04,400
had the honour of extracting
one of II Duce's teeth...

383
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,600
publicly declare
that he is your fiancée?

384
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:11,000
He made that up.
I had nothing to do with it.

385
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,800
Your husband's crazy.

386
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:17,700
What kind of relationship
did you have with Lt. Cadei?

387
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:25,400
I'm a widow. My business
and that of Lt. Cadei...

388
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,600
are no concern of the law.

389
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:33,100
AII right.
Did you know that,

390
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:37,000
as a result of these affairs,
Lt. Cadei was transferred to Albania?

391
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:37,700
One down.

392
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:41,400
And before his departure,
he was questioned in judicial inquiry.

393
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:42,600
Clerk.

394
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,100
He declared to have encountered

395
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:49,500
the widow Scordia only twice...
in her home,

396
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:53,800
and to have had
no amorous relationship...

397
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:58,100
considering their relationship
''just a casual friendship.''

398
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:02,900
Son of a bitch.

399
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,900
Lt. Cadei was received by my client...

400
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,400
and she makes no secret
about having had for him...

401
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:14,000
certain feelings.

402
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:17,500
But unlike the married Cusimano,

403
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:22,400
who was, let's face it, guilty...

404
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:25,100
of a pre-senile dimming of the senses...

405
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:28,100
of an intoxicating
kaleidoscope of desires...

406
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:33,400
Unlike the family man Cusimano,
But...

407
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,600
Cadei is...

408
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:39,600
and was...

409
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:41,000
a bachelor... a bachelor!

410
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,100
Clever, that lawyer.

411
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,100
He's a bachelor himself.

412
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:50,200
Careful investigation
of the facts tell us, therefore...

413
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:53,500
that the Scordia woman
committed no other crime...

414
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:56,100
than that of being ill-fated,

415
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,900
alone and beautiful.

416
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,000
Here is her crime: her beauty!

417
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:03,600
And from here, the envy,

418
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,100
the lies, the disgrace,

419
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:09,500
that have deprived her
even of a father's trust!

420
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:13,900
And yet, she herself
is still in silent agony...

421
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,700
mourning over
that unmarked war grave...

422
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:23,700
in faraway East Africa.

423
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,000
In the beating heart of our argument...

424
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:32,600
is an audacious,
but nonetheless valid, thesis...

425
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:34,700
which asks just one question:

426
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:36,800
Can a young woman...

427
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:41,500
after the odyssey of a widowhood
endured for the love of country...

428
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:46,600
hope for protection
in the shelter of a new life?

429
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,900
Does she have the right
to yearn for, and to write...

430
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:53,000
a new ending to her own love story?

431
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,700
Your Honor,

432
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:58,000
the citizens
of CasteIcuto reply: ''Yes!''

433
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,100
Will Cusimano
Leave me alone now?

434
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:15,900
Of course. He's been put
into a psychiatric clinic.

435
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,900
He wants to volunteer
for the Forces in East Africa.

436
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:23,700
He doesn't realize
we lost Africa ages ago!

437
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:27,500
But Let’s forget Cusimano
and the fickle Lt. Cadei.

438
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,900
Let's get to us!

439
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:35,700
I know it's not much.

440
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:39,300
But it's all I have.
They've cut my pension.

441
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:41,600
Don't you understand?

442
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,300
That's peanuts!

443
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:47,000
My fee is much more than that.

444
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:50,800
You’ll never have enough money!

445
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:53,800
But how will I ever repay you?

446
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:56,700
It's very easy, my sweet.

447
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:01,000
-What are you saying?
-Be with me, my love!

448
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,800
I'm in love with you!

449
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:09,900
A woman shouldn’t be alone
during these hard times.

450
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:13,100
I am a wealthy man.
You won't find better.

451
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:17,900
I'II take care of your father.
You’ll never have to worry again.

452
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:45,400
I forgive her. She did it
to pay her lawyer's fees

453
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,000
only once and never again.

454
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,300
But you didn't keep our agreement.

455
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:52,800
Now we're even.

456
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:01,100
Signora Malena,
a more capable person than me...

457
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:04,900
wrote that the only truelove
is unrequited love.

458
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,700
Now I understand why.

459
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,800
It's been so long since you
Last came out of your house.

460
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,300
But the longer we are apart,
the stronger my love becomes.

461
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:17,900
They say you're about to marry
Centorbi, the lawyer.

462
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,900
I know how badly
they treat you here,

463
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,300
how the women in the market
won't seek you any good food...

464
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:25,800
and no man would hire you
for fear of his wife.

465
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:30,000
But how will you manage to live
with a fat, old man...

466
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:33,200
so ugly that no girl
ever wanted him?

467
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:38,000
They say he never washes
and stinks like a goat.

468
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:41,100
How will your smooth, white skin...
bear rubbing against

469
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,200
the sweat of an old man...

470
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:47,000
who never does anything
without his mother's consent?

471
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:14,000
Is it true you're getting married?

472
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:17,200
What are you writing?

473
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:20,200
Give me that!
Let me see!

474
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,300
Get out!

475
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:46,200
Stand up straight.

476
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:48,200
A little longer, Don Placido.

477
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:52,200
More room in the waist,
for when he gets bigger.

478
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:53,400
Will they be ready tomorrow?

479
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:57,100
The war has ruined
my business, but it still takes time.

480
01:00:57,300 --> 01:00:59,400
...as Allied bombings continue.

481
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:07,000
Wait for me.

482
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:13,100
Lord, help me with my mother,
I beg you.

483
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,100
Moron! Idiot!

484
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:22,400
Idiot!

485
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,500
You can't treat me like a child.
I'm a grown man!

486
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:26,300
Get this straight.
Your father's good name...

487
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:30,500
will never belong
to that disgusting whore!

488
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,800
Never! Never!

489
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:36,900
Never!

490
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,100
The lawyer was left
high and dry!

491
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:05,500
His mother stiII bathes him
every Saturday!

492
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,800
MaIena always has someone
throwing a wrench in the works!

493
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:12,400
It won't be hard finding someone
to repIace the lawyer!

494
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:18,000
-Come on, sit down.
-The next in line already has a plan.

495
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,400
Yeah, his plan
is in his pants.

496
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,300
-A cut and shave.
-Right away, sir.

497
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,300
Good morning, Antonio.

498
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:49,100
I brought some sugar and flour.

499
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,300
-What about the bread?
-The best.

500
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000
-I can't pay right now.
-That's no problem.

501
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:02,100
I'm sure we can find a way
to make you some money.

502
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:08,600
Hurry, there's someone else over here!

503
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,400
It's Professor Bonsignore.

504
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:34,500
Malena’s father.

505
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,200
I'm here for you.

506
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:43,800
Condolences, Signora Scordia.

507
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:47,900
Condolences.

508
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:54,200
Step aside, kid.

509
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:56,800
Signora, what can we do?
We're in the Lord's hands.

510
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:57,800
Don't forget my offer.

511
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:39,900
-Who is it?
-It's me.

512
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:41,600
-Me who?
-Salvatore. Antonio sent me.

513
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:44,300
I brought you some more food.

514
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:46,700
Come in.

515
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:02,900
-Your hair looks terrific.
-Do you like it?

516
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:06,800
-Yes, it makes you look younger.
-Thank you.

517
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,700
I can come every Thursday!

518
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,400
As long as you bring the food.

519
01:10:56,900 --> 01:11:00,500
Never before in our history have
we been called upon to band together.

520
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:03,400
Just a few years ago,
II Duce promised

521
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:07,000
that the Nazis would
never occupy Sicily.

522
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,800
Look! The Germans are everywhere!

523
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,800
Look who's here.

524
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:34,900
She's a redhead now.

525
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,700
Look how she's put together.

526
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:40,000
I'd like to cut off that hair.

527
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:52,800
How disgusting!

528
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:42,600
Now she's even screwing the Germans.

529
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:46,500
-Who's that?
-Malena Scordia, the slut.

530
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:49,600
She's teamed up
with that other whore, Gina.

531
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:52,400
But with the Germans?

532
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:55,900
Seems there are gymnastics
at the Moderno Hotel.

533
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:59,000
The two whores run
from room to room...

534
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,800
servicing a dozen officers at a time.

535
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:04,700
Holy shit!

536
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:37,900
My good woman, this child
is possessed by the devil!

537
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:40,200
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

538
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:49,700
Rosa!

539
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,400
Come here!

540
01:14:55,900 --> 01:14:57,500
That's enough!

541
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:00,700
It looks like you're posing
for Michelangelo’s Pieta of the poor!

542
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:02,000
No.

543
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:05,700
Evil eye on blood is fed.
Hold on fast till death is past.

544
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:09,000
Exorcise the devil
from this child.

545
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:10,900
Goat red, on wood fed,
hold on fast.

546
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,400
Head and tail,
evil eye release this child.

547
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:15,900
Cast the devil into the wild.

548
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,400
Shameful!

549
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:22,000
Disgraceful!

550
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,800
They cured my uncle this way...
and he had cholera!

551
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:29,600
Your son's not sick!
He's becoming a man!

552
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:32,800
With a dick this big,
he needs to fuck!

553
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:42,800
Renato!

554
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,900
Renato, wait here for me.

555
01:15:58,100 --> 01:16:00,800
Come here. Come on.
Close the door.

556
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:03,200
-My father?
-He's coming.

557
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:06,000
Ladies!

558
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,700
Choose the one you like.

559
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:10,800
Ladies!

560
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:12,700
What do we have here?

561
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:14,700
Fresh young meat.

562
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,500
Lupetta, up to the room.

563
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,100
Treat him right.

564
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,200
-What's your name?
-Amoroso Renato.

565
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:37,200
Amoroso. What a romantic name!

566
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:41,700
Tonight we either die in a bombing
or end up in jail.

567
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:47,300
Go ahead.

568
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:30,300
-Is it your first time?
-No.

569
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,900
I've imagined it many times.

570
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:55,500
Let's go give that shameless whore
what she deserves.

571
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:03,200
Stay back.
This is between the women.

572
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:31,500
Now you’ll see what happens
when you steal our men...

573
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:43,600
and sleep with the filthy Germans.

574
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:48,000
It's the end of spreading
your legs, whore!

575
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:06,300
Now let's see
what men make of you!

576
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,600
The madam is served.

577
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:22,400
Get lost!

578
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:25,200
Disappear!

579
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:12,600
-I know that face.
-Who is it?

580
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:17,500
Nino Scordia,
Malena’s husband.

581
01:28:17,700 --> 01:28:20,800
Malena, the one who did it
with the Germans.

582
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:30,600
Poor guy.
He was better off dead.

583
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:38,300
Isn't that Malena’s husband?

584
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:07,500
Hey, Giovanni,
there's a strange guy.

585
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:18,000
Do you know Malena Scordia?

586
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:19,900
Who's she?

587
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,400
Who are you?
This is my family’s house!

588
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,200
We don't know anything.

589
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:26,900
When we came,
no one was living here.

590
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:28,500
No one?

591
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:45,900
Poor guy. No one
will tell him the truth.

592
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,700
What would you say,
''I hear your wife is a prostitute''?

593
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:53,400
I hear she's still
a great piece of ass.

594
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:56,800
I lost an arm.
I wasn't dead!

595
01:29:56,900 --> 01:30:01,100
Then I was taken prisoner in India
and I contracted malaria. Tell him.

596
01:30:01,300 --> 01:30:03,700
Sir, he lost his arm...

597
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:06,000
Hey, kid, what are
you doing here? Go away.

598
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:07,800
Me ''boy-bar.'' Coffee.

599
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,700
I have to get the coffee cups.
Understand?

600
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:12,800
Okay, okay.

601
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:16,700
My family has lived in this town
for generations.

602
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:18,900
Now no one will talk to me.

603
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,400
My house is a refugee camp,
and my wife has disappeared.

604
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:23,400
No one in town knows
where she is.

605
01:30:24,700 --> 01:30:27,200
his wife was the woman

606
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:29,800
we saw beaten up
on the day we arrived here.

607
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,700
Everybody says she's
a prostitute in a whorehouse.

608
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:34,900
Help me find her.
I want to bring her home.

609
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:01,700
Excuse me. Don't you remember me?
I'm Nino Scordia.

610
01:31:01,900 --> 01:31:05,500
-You mistake me for someone else.
-Could I have a light?

611
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:09,700
You were the Fascist secretary,
and you were his deputy.

612
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:11,600
You can help me. Do you know
what happened to my wife?

613
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:14,000
Didn't she join the Communist Party?

614
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:19,500
She was photographed
with her arms around the Commie Leader.

615
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,500
You're a family of heroes!

616
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:28,000
You're right.

617
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:32,500
Those who fought the war
for you bastards aren't heroes.

618
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:36,800
Go take a walk through
the brothels of Sicily.

619
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:40,300
You may find your wife there!

620
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:42,200
Wait a minute. Come back!

621
01:32:48,100 --> 01:32:49,700
Dear Signor Scordia,

622
01:32:49,900 --> 01:32:53,600
forgive me if I don't have
the courage to speak man to man.

623
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:58,700
These last months have
taught me much about courage,
even if I have found littIe myself.

624
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,700
I'm the only one who knows
the truth about your wife.

625
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:05,900
Around here, they only say
bad things about her.

626
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:10,000
But believe me, your wife
Malena was faithful to you.

627
01:33:10,100 --> 01:33:13,700
You are the only man she loved.
This is the honest truth.

628
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:16,600
It is true,
a lot of things happened,

629
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:19,900
but back then,
you had been dead along time.

630
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:24,700
The last time I saw her, she was
on a train for Messina.

631
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:29,000
I should sign ''a friend,''
Like all anonymous letters,

632
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:31,000
but my name is Renato.

633
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:11,400
Good morning, Judge.

634
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:14,800
AII is well, thank God.

635
01:34:16,700 --> 01:34:18,200
Eat up, my sweet pea.

636
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:31,600
-Sons of bitches!
-Look who's here!

637
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,800
Giorgio, look who's here!

638
01:35:35,100 --> 01:35:37,700
Why are you all
Looking at that woman?

639
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:39,300
It's nothing.

640
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:09,000
I saw them in the square.
They were waking arm in arm.

641
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:11,000
Quiet. She's here!

642
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:15,400
It took a lot of courage to come back.

643
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:17,800
Look who's here.

644
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,800
I heard it,
but I didn't believe it.

645
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:24,600
-What have they got to look at?
-They should leave her in peace.

646
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:29,900
She's got some wrinkles
around her eyes.

647
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,600
She's put on weight, too.

648
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,900
But she's still beautiful.

649
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:38,300
Good morning, Mrs. Scordia.

650
01:36:53,700 --> 01:36:54,900
Good morning.

651
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:00,100
Want some nice tomatoes?
They cost less over there.

652
01:37:00,100 --> 01:37:02,400
-Good morning.
-Thank you.

653
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:07,300
Nice things here!

654
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:10,900
-Like it, Signora Malena?
-Yes.

655
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,300
-Try it on.
-No, that's okay.

656
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:15,400
-It's no problem.
-Another time.

657
01:37:15,900 --> 01:37:19,600
Give me your bag.
We'll discuss it later.

658
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:22,400
-Thank you.
-Good day.

659
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,400
It's okay. I'II get it.

660
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,300
Thank you.

661
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:31,400
Thank you for your help.

662
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:39,500
Good luck, Signora Malena.

663
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:11,800
I pedaled as fast as I could

664
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,900
as if I were escaping...

665
01:39:14,100 --> 01:39:17,000
from longing,
from innocence, from her.

666
01:39:17,100 --> 01:39:19,500
Time has passed,
and I have loved many women.

667
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:22,500
And as they've held me close...

668
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:27,000
and asked if I will
remember them,

669
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:32,100
I've said,
''Yes, I will remember you.''

670
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:36,000
But the only one I've never forgotten
is the one who never asked...

671
01:39:36,100 --> 01:39:37,200
Malena.
