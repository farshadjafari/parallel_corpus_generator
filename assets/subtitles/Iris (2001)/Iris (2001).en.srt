1
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,719
I want you to come quick.

2
00:02:17,928 --> 00:02:19,388
Don't go!

3
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:39,237
Edward Lanman was sitting in
his pleasant house in London

4
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:46,534
The sun was shining
It was an early morning in June, not quite...

5
00:02:58,503 --> 00:02:59,545
Iris.

6
00:03:00,128 --> 00:03:01,588
Iris, wait for me.

7
00:03:02,214 --> 00:03:04,216
Just keep tight hold of me and it'll be all right.

8
00:03:05,216 --> 00:03:07,468
-You won't keep still.
-I can't keep still.

9
00:03:08,302 --> 00:03:10,179
I can't catch up with you.

10
00:03:33,155 --> 00:03:36,784
-Iris, you've got bicycle oil on your ankle.
-I don't care, John.

11
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,204
Those of you, our guests...

12
00:03:41,246 --> 00:03:42,872
... on whose magnificent generosity
we depend...

13
00:03:43,498 --> 00:03:45,624
...we really are most frightfully grateful...

14
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:49,752
...will need no introduction to
one of our most distinguished graduates...

15
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:54,424
... an honorary fellow, Dame Iris Murdoch.

16
00:03:55,591 --> 00:03:59,928
She's a noted philosopher as well as
author of some twenty-six novels.

17
00:04:00,595 --> 00:04:03,055
And we are honoured to have her with us today.

18
00:04:03,597 --> 00:04:07,224
As well as the distinguished
Warton Professor of Literature..

19
00:04:07,766 --> 00:04:10,060
...who has the great good fortune
of being married to her.

20
00:04:11,395 --> 00:04:13,063
I need say no more about her.

21
00:04:13,647 --> 00:04:14,732
For good wine needs no bush.

22
00:04:15,941 --> 00:04:18,277
But she will not mind comparison with...

23
00:04:19,403 --> 00:04:21,322
... say, a really fine vintage claret.

24
00:04:25,157 --> 00:04:28,742
... Dame Iris will speak to you
about the importance of education.

25
00:04:41,795 --> 00:04:46,132
Education doesn't make you happy.
And nor does freedom.

26
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:52,262
We don't become happy
just because we're free -- if we are...

27
00:04:53,055 --> 00:04:55,098
... or because we've been educated, if we have.

28
00:04:56,223 --> 00:04:58,642
But because education may be the means...

29
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:01,061
... by which we realise we are happy.

30
00:05:02,145 --> 00:05:03,479
It opens our eyes, our ears.

31
00:05:04,855 --> 00:05:06,690
Tells us where delights are lurking.

32
00:05:07,983 --> 00:05:10,611
Convinces us that there is only one freedom...

33
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,070
... of any importance whatsoever.

34
00:05:14,029 --> 00:05:15,405
That of the mind.

35
00:05:16,323 --> 00:05:18,116
And gives us the assurance,the confidence...

36
00:05:19,326 --> 00:05:22,912
...to walk the path our mind,
our educated mind offers.

37
00:05:26,874 --> 00:05:30,459
I shall tell him all my love.

38
00:05:31,168 --> 00:05:34,129
All my soul's adoration.

39
00:05:35,756 --> 00:05:38,299
And I think he will hear me.

40
00:05:39,133 --> 00:05:42,303
And will not say me nay.

41
00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:47,139
It is this that gives my soul.

42
00:05:47,807 --> 00:05:52,144
All it's joyous elation.

43
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:56,983
As I hear the sweet larks sing.

44
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:03,319
In the clear air of the day.

45
00:06:03,944 --> 00:06:04,945
Yes, of course there's something fishy...

46
00:06:05,362 --> 00:06:06,530
... about describing people's feelings.

47
00:06:07,531 --> 00:06:08,907
Try hard to beaccurate, but...

48
00:06:09,616 --> 00:06:11,535
... as soon as you start to define
such and such a feeling...

49
00:06:11,576 --> 00:06:12,577
... language let's you down.

50
00:06:12,869 --> 00:06:14,871
When we really speak the truth,
words are insufficient.

51
00:06:15,372 --> 00:06:20,127
Almost everything,
except things like "pass the gravy" ...

52
00:06:20,584 --> 00:06:23,378
... is a lie of a sort.
And that being the case, I shall shut up.

53
00:06:26,005 --> 00:06:28,006
And pass the gravy.

54
00:06:33,136 --> 00:06:34,137
But love, or at least unsatisfied love...

55
00:06:34,721 --> 00:06:35,847
... is concerned as much with understanding.

56
00:06:36,472 --> 00:06:37,723
And real love, extreme love...

57
00:06:38,807 --> 00:06:40,225
... once it's recognised
has stamp of the indubitable...

58
00:06:40,809 --> 00:06:42,351
Ah, John, may I call you, John, may I?

59
00:06:42,768 --> 00:06:43,811
Meet Miss Murdoch.

60
00:06:44,228 --> 00:06:45,187
Iris, my dear, John Bayley.

61
00:06:45,521 --> 00:06:47,356
One of the more promising young lecturers
in the English School.

62
00:06:47,731 --> 00:06:51,359
Though I caught him out over
Old English grammar, his weaker side I fear.

63
00:06:51,776 --> 00:06:54,112
A minor question of Anglo-Saxon syntax.

64
00:06:57,822 --> 00:06:58,823
Wine!

65
00:07:00,408 --> 00:07:01,783
I mean...

66
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,327
... It went down the wrong way.

67
00:07:04,244 --> 00:07:06,622
Yes, I like that.

68
00:07:07,414 --> 00:07:08,915
There is a right way down, of course.

69
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,541
Amazing how most of us find it
without even thinking about it.

70
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,501
I rarely think...

71
00:07:14,127 --> 00:07:15,253
If you think about it, you'll never find it.

72
00:07:16,212 --> 00:07:17,589
Best thing to do
is hang on and trust the body. I do.

73
00:07:19,424 --> 00:07:20,550
Human beings love each other.

74
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:23,927
In sex, in friendship...

75
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:26,220
... and when they're in love.

76
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,848
And they cherish other beings.

77
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:34,436
Humans, animals, plants - even stones.

78
00:07:35,895 --> 00:07:39,190
The quest for happiness
and the promotion of happiness--

79
00:07:40,191 --> 00:07:43,109
--is in all of this
and the power of our imagination.

80
00:07:45,402 --> 00:07:46,695
I'm writing a novel.

81
00:07:48,113 --> 00:07:51,241
I don't suppose you have the time
or the inclination to even read a novel.

82
00:07:52,034 --> 00:07:53,702
I've written one. It's going to be published.

83
00:07:54,536 --> 00:07:55,620
And I'm writing another.

84
00:07:56,287 --> 00:07:58,622
Can I read it?

85
00:07:59,456 --> 00:08:01,540
No-one has read It -- None of my friends.

86
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:04,417
What's it about?

87
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,671
About? It has something for everyone.

88
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:09,923
A bit like Shakespeare?

89
00:08:09,965 --> 00:08:10,924
Perhaps, yes.

90
00:08:11,967 --> 00:08:14,177
Please don't talk to anyone about it.

91
00:08:14,803 --> 00:08:16,805
No. Course not.

92
00:08:16,888 --> 00:08:17,889
I won't tell a soul.

93
00:08:26,352 --> 00:08:29,397
Every human soul has seen,
perhaps even before their birth...

94
00:08:31,857 --> 00:08:36,319
... pure forms. Such as justice, temperance...

95
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:38,613
... beauty ...

96
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,365
... and all the great moral qualities
which we hold in honour.

97
00:08:42,825 --> 00:08:44,368
We are moved towards what is good...

98
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,703
... by the faint memory of these forms.

99
00:08:48,371 --> 00:08:51,124
Simple - -and calm and blessed...

100
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:55,126
...which we saw once in a pure clear light...

101
00:08:56,419 --> 00:08:57,628
... being pure ourselves.

102
00:09:03,925 --> 00:09:07,304
'Wholegrain'.
Do we have wholegrain or something other?

103
00:09:07,887 --> 00:09:10,680
What is whole?
Is It something in itself or does it have parts?

104
00:09:11,014 --> 00:09:12,015
Oh, spaghetti.

105
00:09:13,182 --> 00:09:14,267
If you have a whole you have a whole.

106
00:09:14,309 --> 00:09:15,310
Ooh, sausages.

107
00:09:16,185 --> 00:09:17,186
You and me is a whole.

108
00:09:17,562 --> 00:09:19,938
If you toddle off there's a hole in the whole.
Or, if I do.

109
00:09:20,689 --> 00:09:22,941
But a whole can't be broken,
it just forms another whole.

110
00:09:23,191 --> 00:09:24,151
-Baked beans.
-Baked beans.

111
00:09:25,151 --> 00:09:26,860
Do you want Premium points?

112
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,403
Do we deserve them?

113
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:29,571
-Do you want bags?
-Bags, yes.

114
00:09:30,447 --> 00:09:33,616
You know, it's all around us,
people like you and me talking nonsense.

115
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:34,783
I know, I know.

116
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:36,410
Bag for life:

117
00:09:37,453 --> 00:09:39,370
-For life?
-That's what it says.

118
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,331
We have to ask, give you the choice.

119
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,166
Ooh, rather.

120
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,542
You just have to listen, that's the job.

121
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:49,129
You call it a job but it's like music, what you do.

122
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:53,550
You live with the angels,
speak their language, the music of the spheres.

123
00:09:54,967 --> 00:09:57,594
Nowadays the only language
anyone really understands...

124
00:09:58,011 --> 00:09:59,887
...is pictures. Paint the picture.

125
00:10:02,055 --> 00:10:04,057
See, now I'm bagged for life.

126
00:10:06,017 --> 00:10:07,852
Love's the only language everyone understands.

127
00:10:08,728 --> 00:10:09,771
Ooh love, yes.

128
00:10:10,146 --> 00:10:11,773
I can read It but I can't speak it.

129
00:10:20,612 --> 00:10:23,073
My coat's caught on your chair.

130
00:10:33,082 --> 00:10:36,084
And the captain said
as the two weevils dropped out of the biscuit...

131
00:10:36,542 --> 00:10:38,044
..."which would you rather have, Mr Smith?"

132
00:10:38,543 --> 00:10:39,544
"The bigger one, sir."

133
00:10:40,128 --> 00:10:43,382
"Wrong, Mr Smith, wrong."
"In the Navy you should always...

134
00:10:43,715 --> 00:10:44,715
...choose the lesser of the two weevils."

135
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:46,300
Patrick O'Brian.

136
00:10:46,676 --> 00:10:48,928
"Between two evils
always choose the one you haven't tried before."

137
00:10:49,762 --> 00:10:51,471
Mea West. Oh my vest!

138
00:10:52,055 --> 00:10:53,430
I tore my vest again this morning.

139
00:10:53,681 --> 00:10:54,682
You must get some new vests.

140
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,308
Jolly good.

141
00:10:57,393 --> 00:10:58,768
You must get some new vests.

142
00:10:59,936 --> 00:11:00,895
I just said that.

143
00:11:03,481 --> 00:11:05,817
You're always saying
that you just said something. Me too.

144
00:11:06,776 --> 00:11:08,943
Good job
you reminded me I had two lectures today.

145
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:10,570
You remembered.

146
00:11:11,195 --> 00:11:14,115
No, but I remembered
to apologise for the one I forgot.

147
00:11:14,115 --> 00:11:15,116
They were very sweet about it.

148
00:11:16,117 --> 00:11:17,618
Glad not to have listen to you, I expect.

149
00:11:18,034 --> 00:11:19,035
Oh, I'm sure.

150
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,538
They'd have been delighted
to have listened to you.

151
00:11:22,664 --> 00:11:23,831
I always have been.

152
00:11:34,631 --> 00:11:36,174
-Iris!
-John.

153
00:11:39,093 --> 00:11:41,095
Than kyou. Keep the change.

154
00:11:41,803 --> 00:11:44,097
-Janet. Janet!
-Oh my God, Iris.

155
00:11:45,557 --> 00:11:46,558
Am I late?

156
00:11:47,767 --> 00:11:50,520
Oh no, it's the hokie-cokie.
Everything will be over.

157
00:11:51,146 --> 00:11:55,773
Oh, John, wait. I've got my stocking caught up.

158
00:11:56,566 --> 00:11:58,858
Stupid things. Really.

159
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:13,956
I'm not sure I'm entirely -- I'm so sorry.

160
00:12:15,749 --> 00:12:16,750
Oh, sorry.

161
00:12:19,918 --> 00:12:20,919
Cha-cha-cha.

162
00:12:28,175 --> 00:12:29,176
Cha-cha-cha.

163
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:34,305
-Thank you.
-You too.

164
00:12:37,599 --> 00:12:38,934
That was my husband.

165
00:12:41,853 --> 00:12:42,811
Cha-cha-cha.

166
00:12:45,856 --> 00:12:47,358
Are you with Iris?

167
00:12:48,525 --> 00:12:49,651
Hoping so.

168
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,777
You know we have...

169
00:12:51,818 --> 00:12:52,819
I thought we had.

170
00:12:52,861 --> 00:12:53,820
...nearly met.

171
00:12:54,238 --> 00:12:56,073
-Are you a friend of Iris?
-Yes.

172
00:12:56,781 --> 00:12:58,991
She seems to have a lot of f...

173
00:12:59,492 --> 00:13:06,330
Janet Stone. John Bayley.

174
00:13:06,956 --> 00:13:08,415
-How do you do?
-How do you do?

175
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,501
Shall we?

176
00:13:10,668 --> 00:13:11,669
What are your rooms like?

177
00:13:12,211 --> 00:13:13,337
Adequate,thank you.

178
00:13:14,129 --> 00:13:15,673
I'd like to see them.

179
00:13:19,384 --> 00:13:21,718
Do you have a lot of friends?

180
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:23,553
Is a list of my friends necessary?

181
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,763
I justwondered if you had many.

182
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,391
There aren't many people
that one wants to know one.

183
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,394
Iris!

184
00:13:39,775 --> 00:13:40,775
You might fall.

185
00:13:41,859 --> 00:13:43,111
Would you like some champagne?

186
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:44,529
That would be nice.

187
00:13:44,821 --> 00:13:47,574
I've had some since Christmas...
It does keep, doesn't it?

188
00:13:56,246 --> 00:13:58,622
I shouldn't be doing this.

189
00:13:59,081 --> 00:13:59,999
What?

190
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,918
Having women in my room. It's not permitted.

191
00:14:03,752 --> 00:14:05,087
I wouldn't say you'd had me exactly.

192
00:14:06,297 --> 00:14:11,176
Have you danced before?

193
00:14:12,761 --> 00:14:13,929
It was all right, wasn't it?

194
00:14:15,096 --> 00:14:16,221
Oh, I think so.

195
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,806
Broke the ice, so to speak.

196
00:14:19,098 --> 00:14:20,057
-"Ice"?
-What?

197
00:14:21,933 --> 00:14:23,643
It'll do.

198
00:14:24,603 --> 00:14:26,855
Aren't you particular
about words at your college?

199
00:14:27,397 --> 00:14:31,358
I'm only here under sufferance really,
as a tutor and guide.

200
00:14:32,109 --> 00:14:34,653
I get all the Americans
and Frenchmen to mother.

201
00:14:36,696 --> 00:14:38,156
You love words, don't you?

202
00:14:39,324 --> 00:14:40,742
If one doesn't have words, how does one think?

203
00:14:44,703 --> 00:14:46,121
Shall I do that?

204
00:14:47,289 --> 00:14:50,081
What is your novel about?

205
00:14:50,874 --> 00:14:52,334
About?

206
00:14:54,085 --> 00:14:55,085
How to be free.

207
00:14:55,753 --> 00:14:56,754
How to be good...

208
00:14:59,256 --> 00:15:00,424
...and how to love.

209
00:15:01,675 --> 00:15:03,385
Well, that's all there is, I'd say.

210
00:15:06,929 --> 00:15:09,514
Language is all very well, you know, but...

211
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:12,059
...it's not the only way
of understanding each other.

212
00:15:13,602 --> 00:15:14,602
There's sight and...

213
00:15:14,977 --> 00:15:17,480
...and smell and...touch, of course.

214
00:15:22,691 --> 00:15:23,901
I love your nose.

215
00:15:26,111 --> 00:15:27,154
It's snub.

216
00:15:36,954 --> 00:15:37,955
Snubby...

217
00:15:38,496 --> 00:15:39,830
...snubby, snubby.

218
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,210
it's snubby, snubby, snubby.

219
00:16:06,478 --> 00:16:07,479
Let me do that to you.

220
00:16:08,939 --> 00:16:09,940
Take off your jacket.

221
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:36,711
If we were, as it were, married...

222
00:16:37,044 --> 00:16:38,337
...we could do this all the time.

223
00:16:39,046 --> 00:16:40,046
Perhaps?

224
00:16:41,798 --> 00:16:43,550
We should be doing it nearly all the time.

225
00:16:43,884 --> 00:16:45,427
Yes, but if...

226
00:16:51,264 --> 00:16:53,724
Thank you.

227
00:17:27,585 --> 00:17:28,586
Look.

228
00:17:38,844 --> 00:17:39,845
I'm stopping you working.

229
00:17:40,387 --> 00:17:41,639
Yes, well, I don't mind.

230
00:17:45,726 --> 00:17:47,186
How's it coming along?

231
00:17:48,353 --> 00:17:50,063
It's harder to write than all the others. Much.

232
00:17:50,812 --> 00:17:51,813
Have you noticed?

233
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:56,817
Just that you've seemed...
puzzled every now and again.

234
00:17:57,567 --> 00:17:58,568
That's it, yes.

235
00:18:00,445 --> 00:18:01,571
Puzzled.

236
00:18:04,032 --> 00:18:09,329
Puzzled. It's a funny word.

237
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:13,915
All words are like that
when you take them by surprise, aren't they?

238
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,375
Have you got a title?

239
00:18:19,043 --> 00:18:20,378
'A lot of trees...

240
00:18:21,462 --> 00:18:22,672
...seem near.'

241
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,260
We must stop it.

242
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,761
What to do?

243
00:18:30,095 --> 00:18:33,722
The window, John, the window!
We must stop it.

244
00:18:34,723 --> 00:18:35,724
No. See...

245
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,601
...it's gone.

246
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:48,651
We all worry about going mad, don'twe?

247
00:18:51,487 --> 00:18:52,779
How would we know...

248
00:18:53,697 --> 00:18:55,574
...those of us who live in our minds anyway?

249
00:18:59,452 --> 00:19:00,912
Other people would tell us.

250
00:19:03,288 --> 00:19:04,289
Would they, John?

251
00:19:10,211 --> 00:19:12,171
I don't want to set the world...

252
00:19:12,754 --> 00:19:13,755
Sorry.

253
00:19:14,673 --> 00:19:19,593
...on fire.

254
00:19:20,051 --> 00:19:21,511
John Bayley.

255
00:19:39,651 --> 00:19:40,652
Haven't seen her for ages.

256
00:19:41,069 --> 00:19:42,946
Jolly good -- nice.

257
00:19:44,698 --> 00:19:46,616
Takes all sorts. Not that I ...

258
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:50,076
...we're all men at St Anthony's.

259
00:19:50,951 --> 00:19:52,118
Do you like women?

260
00:19:52,452 --> 00:19:54,787
I mean, do women like you?

261
00:19:55,663 --> 00:19:56,831
You mean lesbians?

262
00:19:57,499 --> 00:19:58,500
Yes.

263
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,376
Would it bother you if they did?

264
00:20:00,794 --> 00:20:04,005
Oh no, the some thing happens with me.
With homosexuals, I mean.

265
00:20:04,464 --> 00:20:05,465
And do you go to bed with them?

266
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:07,050
Lord no.

267
00:20:08,593 --> 00:20:11,969
At the college... they are all,
as somebody once said to me...

268
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:14,971
..."Old fashioned lesbians of the highest type".

269
00:20:15,471 --> 00:20:20,142
And do you go to bed with them?

270
00:22:59,855 --> 00:23:01,315
-Dame Iris?
-Yeah.

271
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,235
It's this way.

272
00:23:04,735 --> 00:23:07,113
She's written philosophy and plays and poetry...

273
00:23:07,947 --> 00:23:10,740
...but her novels are her lasting literay legacy.

274
00:23:11,574 --> 00:23:15,076
Iris Murdoch is acknowledged
as the foremost English novelist...

275
00:23:15,201 --> 00:23:16,202
...of her generation.

276
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:19,205
A little excessive, don't you think?

277
00:23:20,123 --> 00:23:21,499
What do you reckon, shall I take that again?

278
00:23:24,626 --> 00:23:26,753
Her novels embrace the subjects of freedom...

279
00:23:27,337 --> 00:23:28,879
...and what it means to be good.

280
00:23:29,797 --> 00:23:33,258
And they're all studies
in the successes and failures of love.

281
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,636
She's written philosophy and plays and poetry...

282
00:23:37,137 --> 00:23:40,098
...but her novels are her lasting literay legacy.

283
00:23:40,765 --> 00:23:43,142
People, ofcourse,
are very secretive and for many reasons...

284
00:23:43,642 --> 00:23:46,602
...want to appear what they call 'ordinary'.

285
00:23:48,228 --> 00:23:51,897
Everybody has thoughts they want to conceal.

286
00:23:52,982 --> 00:23:55,067
Perhaps even
quite simple aspects of their lives.

287
00:23:56,318 --> 00:23:59,780
People have obsessions and fears and...

288
00:24:00,156 --> 00:24:01,740
...and passions which they don't admit to.

289
00:24:02,825 --> 00:24:06,911
I think any character
is interesting and has extremes.

290
00:24:09,746 --> 00:24:11,748
it's a novelist's privilege to...

291
00:24:12,831 --> 00:24:14,666
...see how odd everyone is.

292
00:24:15,292 --> 00:24:16,793
In your novels you yourself...

293
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:19,171
...were very exacting your use of language...

294
00:24:20,005 --> 00:24:22,923
...but in general terms, do you think
the language is becoming debased?

295
00:24:25,634 --> 00:24:26,719
Reading and writing...

296
00:24:27,093 --> 00:24:29,679
...and the preservation of language
and its forms...

297
00:24:30,847 --> 00:24:32,348
...and...

298
00:24:32,848 --> 00:24:37,811
...the kind of eloquence
and beauty that language is capable of...

299
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:41,688
...is something terribly important
to human beings...

300
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:46,234
...this is connected to thought.

301
00:24:47,693 --> 00:24:49,028
If children are not taught...

302
00:25:01,205 --> 00:25:02,790
What did you say? Did you ask...?

303
00:25:03,165 --> 00:25:05,375
I was asking about the importance of language.

304
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:32,021
John.

305
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:34,524
John. John.

306
00:25:35,108 --> 00:25:36,776
Iris?

307
00:25:39,487 --> 00:25:40,613
John.

308
00:25:42,781 --> 00:25:44,240
-Oh, you're there. I'm back.
-What is it?

309
00:25:44,698 --> 00:25:47,991
-Much earlier than I thought.
-Yes, I came straight  back.

310
00:25:48,909 --> 00:25:50,160
I didn't know why I was there.

311
00:25:50,953 --> 00:25:51,954
You were going to do an interview.

312
00:25:52,413 --> 00:25:53,455
-Well,what interview?
-I don't know.

313
00:25:53,872 --> 00:25:56,250
And see your publisher?

314
00:25:56,708 --> 00:25:59,086
-Was it your publisher?
-So I came back.

315
00:26:00,045 --> 00:26:01,296
I didn't expect you back for ages.

316
00:26:01,672 --> 00:26:03,257
-Has Norah rung?
-I didn't answer.

317
00:26:03,882 --> 00:26:06,675
Iris, Norah's dead.

318
00:26:07,591 --> 00:26:10,010
Oh, so she is. Oh,that is sad.

319
00:26:11,052 --> 00:26:12,345
Of, well, nevermind.

320
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:13,638
It must have been Ed.

321
00:26:14,389 --> 00:26:15,390
What for?

322
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:20,103
Oh, so I came back.

323
00:26:23,856 --> 00:26:24,857
What is...

324
00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:27,483
...the name of the Prime Minister?

325
00:26:34,656 --> 00:26:36,908
-Are you asking me?
-Yes, I am.

326
00:26:39,285 --> 00:26:40,243
I know.

327
00:26:41,911 --> 00:26:44,164
Okay, what is the name of the Prime Minister?

328
00:26:44,497 --> 00:26:45,998
I don't know. Ask John. Surely It doesn't matter.

329
00:26:46,415 --> 00:26:49,084
Okay. Well, no, not really.

330
00:26:49,793 --> 00:26:51,170
Someone will know.

331
00:26:56,631 --> 00:26:57,883
Who would you like to see?

332
00:26:58,633 --> 00:27:00,260
-I mean, is there anyone...?
-I don't know.

333
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:03,263
Shall I look up some names, talk to someone?

334
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:04,972
I've got a lot of ideas,
but they won't come together.

335
00:27:05,806 --> 00:27:06,974
It happens all the time, forgetting names.

336
00:27:11,144 --> 00:27:12,519
So, does it happens all the time?

337
00:27:13,437 --> 00:27:15,814
Does she mean "writer's block"?
I suppose she does, but...

338
00:27:16,273 --> 00:27:17,691
-Iris can always write, Doctor.
-Oh, I know.

339
00:27:17,941 --> 00:27:21,986
-Iris is a person of some...
-Yes. But it doesn't work like that...

340
00:27:22,236 --> 00:27:25,864
But surely in her case,
a woman with a first-class mind?

341
00:27:26,239 --> 00:27:29,200
We'll have to be certain.
There'll have to be tests, scans.

342
00:27:29,533 --> 00:27:34,455
Well, I don't think I can...
I mean it's a little beyond my competence.

343
00:27:34,747 --> 00:27:37,875
Iris finds her new book very tiring and difficult.

344
00:27:37,917 --> 00:27:38,918
Basically, I'll arrange something.

345
00:27:40,251 --> 00:27:41,669
Iris has a very clear mind...

346
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:44,337
...mine's a muddle but not hers.

347
00:27:45,088 --> 00:27:47,506
She does everything, always has.
Food, shopping...

348
00:27:47,547 --> 00:27:48,548
...tickets for things...

349
00:27:49,674 --> 00:27:53,887
I never know how she manages
and does her books as well.

350
00:27:54,346 --> 00:27:55,347
Well, they can get your help.

351
00:27:56,848 --> 00:28:01,812
No, nobody would suit. We're odd, you know.

352
00:28:02,062 --> 00:28:04,562
There's a very good place,
a specialist nursing home, Vale Hose.

353
00:28:04,604 --> 00:28:05,605
-Not necessary.
-Oh, no, not yet.

354
00:28:06,522 --> 00:28:07,981
-Not your fault. I'm sorry.
-I'm orry.

355
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:11,484
Well...take care.

356
00:28:11,943 --> 00:28:14,028
Goodbye, Doctor.
Thank you. Careful. Goodbye.

357
00:28:16,906 --> 00:28:17,907
Iris!

358
00:28:18,199 --> 00:28:19,574
I'm sure the country won't go to the dogs.

359
00:28:20,951 --> 00:28:23,370
Not knowing the Prime Minister's name
is not a capital offence.

360
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,871
-Absolutely.
-I know the names that matter.

361
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:27,498
It'll be all right.

362
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:29,500
Well, it will be if you stop worrying.

363
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,001
I've got a book to finish.

364
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:35,630
...Tony Blair. So there.

365
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:45,095
Iris, are you comfortable?

366
00:28:46,138 --> 00:28:49,307
I'm going to start the scan now.
Just keep nice and still.

367
00:28:50,016 --> 00:28:52,686
Try to relax.
It'll take about fifteen minutes.

368
00:29:21,834 --> 00:29:22,834
John.

369
00:29:23,293 --> 00:29:25,462
-Oh Janet.
-I'm sorry.

370
00:29:25,712 --> 00:29:26,838
Is Iris still...? I'm so sorry I'm late.

371
00:29:27,755 --> 00:29:29,214
I don't know what's going to happen, Janet.

372
00:29:29,548 --> 00:29:31,508
I've left the car outside - the engine's running.

373
00:29:32,259 --> 00:29:33,343
-...won't be a mo.
-Right.

374
00:29:33,802 --> 00:29:34,803
-See you out there.
-Yes.

375
00:29:52,901 --> 00:29:54,861
-John, I'm frightened.
-Everyone's doing their best.

376
00:29:59,282 --> 00:30:01,158
Janet's got the car.

377
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:05,118
It will -- be...

378
00:30:14,293 --> 00:30:15,753
-It's done.
-You're finished?

379
00:30:17,296 --> 00:30:18,755
I thought you were close.

380
00:30:19,297 --> 00:30:21,758
So far it hasn't made any difference.

381
00:30:22,633 --> 00:30:23,842
Here's to it.

382
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,428
Must try and keep working.

383
00:30:27,096 --> 00:30:28,221
-You must.
-I will.

384
00:30:29,055 --> 00:30:30,056
And here's to the next one.

385
00:30:30,473 --> 00:30:32,767
Just keep working,
keep talking, keep the words coming.

386
00:30:33,393 --> 00:30:34,560
Keep at it.

387
00:30:34,851 --> 00:30:36,769
I shall come on
like a deprived animal if I can't write.

388
00:30:37,645 --> 00:30:38,854
Be liked a starved dog.

389
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,940
No, no, no. I'll keep you at it.

390
00:30:42,148 --> 00:30:44,442
I feel...

391
00:30:45,568 --> 00:30:49,280
...as if I'm sailing into darkness.

392
00:30:54,992 --> 00:30:56,911
Thing you eat with.

393
00:30:58,913 --> 00:30:59,914
animal

394
00:31:00,623 --> 00:31:03,792
An-im-al.

395
00:31:07,211 --> 00:31:08,712
Toothbrush.

396
00:31:10,213 --> 00:31:11,923
...no...

397
00:31:13,133 --> 00:31:14,134
Yes.

398
00:31:16,051 --> 00:31:20,472
Por...

399
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,558
No. See...

400
00:31:24,892 --> 00:31:25,892
Portrait

401
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:27,769
Tennis thing.

402
00:31:31,064 --> 00:31:33,150
dog

403
00:31:33,483 --> 00:31:34,609
God.

404
00:31:36,193 --> 00:31:38,195
Iris is getting tired, I'm afraid.

405
00:31:38,571 --> 00:31:40,739
Can we have the blinds?

406
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:43,323
Dame Iris, thank you very much. Than kyou.

407
00:31:44,073 --> 00:31:45,199
Well done, puss.

408
00:31:45,658 --> 00:31:47,118
Dame Iris, thank you very much indeed.

409
00:31:48,828 --> 00:31:50,163
It's so kind of you to come, Dame Iris.

410
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,123
Thank you, I like it. Thank you very much.

411
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,541
Is it any help?

412
00:31:53,958 --> 00:31:55,168
Well to us? Yes.

413
00:31:55,752 --> 00:31:58,254
It's implacable.

414
00:31:59,254 --> 00:32:00,505
What does that mean?

415
00:32:01,464 --> 00:32:02,839
It means inexorable.

416
00:32:03,173 --> 00:32:07,343
I know what the word means -- to me. To us.

417
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,803
You see, words have meant everything to her.

418
00:32:10,763 --> 00:32:13,140
They would still mean something?
Some thought?

419
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:17,185
It can't just be dead birds dropping.

420
00:32:17,643 --> 00:32:20,313
I know what it means and,
it doesn't surprise me...

421
00:32:21,271 --> 00:32:22,272
... it frightens me, but...

422
00:32:23,273 --> 00:32:25,150
...and then sometimes
it doesn't frighten me and ...

423
00:32:26,525 --> 00:32:30,321
...that's just as bad
because that's it winning, isn't it?

424
00:32:31,989 --> 00:32:34,366
No, it's not...It won't win.

425
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,660
It will win.

426
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:40,536
There. It will win.

427
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:43,873
That's very kind.

428
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:53,631
Iris.

429
00:32:53,923 --> 00:32:55,257
Iris,wait for me.

430
00:32:55,883 --> 00:32:58,552
Just keep tight hold of me and it'll be all right!

431
00:32:59,637 --> 00:33:01,012
You won't keep still!

432
00:33:01,388 --> 00:33:02,722
I can' tkeep still!

433
00:33:03,056 --> 00:33:05,057
I can't catch up with you!

434
00:33:05,224 --> 00:33:06,225
Speed up!

435
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:22,571
Oh, good morning.

436
00:33:23,072 --> 00:33:24,072
Ah, no...

437
00:33:25,365 --> 00:33:28,201
I think it's the...

438
00:33:28,952 --> 00:33:31,121
...person who brings the post, John!

439
00:33:31,746 --> 00:33:33,039
-Yes, it is.
-Yes.

440
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,457
John! So Sorry.

441
00:33:36,208 --> 00:33:37,458
-Thank you.
-Thank you very much indeed.

442
00:33:38,084 --> 00:33:39,584
So Sorry.

443
00:33:45,589 --> 00:33:47,216
Go on. Go on, go on, go on...

444
00:33:51,345 --> 00:33:52,388
It's only the postman.

445
00:33:52,847 --> 00:33:55,099
-It's only the postman.
-Don't repeat everything, puss.

446
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:56,892
It's only the postman.

447
00:33:57,726 --> 00:33:59,893
It's for you -- It's your book.

448
00:34:00,394 --> 00:34:02,395
-What's that?
-Your book.

449
00:34:03,104 --> 00:34:04,271
It's only the postman.

450
00:34:05,897 --> 00:34:07,274
It's your book.

451
00:34:07,607 --> 00:34:09,901
-IRIS MURDOCH - JACKSON'S DILEMA
-Isn't it perfectly splendid?

452
00:34:10,652 --> 00:34:13,447
Why don't you look at it?

453
00:34:14,613 --> 00:34:16,198
It's only the postman.

454
00:34:24,955 --> 00:34:25,956
Oh, damn!

455
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:30,628
Stop nudging up to me like a water buffalo.

456
00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:32,879
I have a lot to do. Lots to do, Iris.

457
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:36,632
See what I've done now?!

458
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:39,884
It's not your fault. Not your fault. Sorry, sorry.

459
00:34:40,635 --> 00:34:43,554
-It's only the postman.
-Yes, all right, it's only the postman.

460
00:34:43,971 --> 00:34:45,514
So sorry. There's lots to do.

461
00:35:08,866 --> 00:35:10,159
Which side do I go?

462
00:35:25,713 --> 00:35:28,800
Ask me my three
main priorities for Government...

463
00:35:29,676 --> 00:35:31,177
...and I tell you...

464
00:35:31,552 --> 00:35:34,262
...education, education and education.

465
00:35:35,597 --> 00:35:39,556
John. John! Why does he keep saying that?
What does he mean?

466
00:35:40,766 --> 00:35:44,478
-By what?
-Education, education, education.

467
00:35:46,188 --> 00:35:49,817
I think he means learning,
everyone getting enough of it.

468
00:35:50,567 --> 00:35:52,152
Why does he keep saying it?

469
00:35:52,695 --> 00:35:56,155
Politicians have to keep repeating things
to make themselves heard.

470
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:03,034
They have to do anything
to make themselves liked.

471
00:36:04,703 --> 00:36:07,956
Why does he want to eat a sheep's ear?

472
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,041
Shall I turn it off?

473
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:11,084
No!

474
00:36:11,543 --> 00:36:14,128
We could go for a swim tomorrow,
if it's not raining.

475
00:36:14,712 --> 00:36:16,588
-No.
-Yes, you love water.

476
00:36:17,047 --> 00:36:21,134
When you swim you love it, swim?
Swim is good for you.

477
00:36:23,635 --> 00:36:24,886
When are we leaving?

478
00:36:26,305 --> 00:36:27,431
Not today.

479
00:36:28,765 --> 00:36:29,849
Are we going to London?

480
00:36:30,141 --> 00:36:31,142
No, we're going for a swim.

481
00:36:33,727 --> 00:36:35,645
When are we leaving?

482
00:36:36,521 --> 00:36:37,605
Not today.

483
00:36:39,064 --> 00:36:41,275
When are we leaving?

484
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,203
Iris -- Iris, wait for me.

485
00:37:05,252 --> 00:37:08,547
-You dirty old man!
-Hello.

486
00:37:11,215 --> 00:37:13,051
There we go. Well done.

487
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:16,345
No, Iris, not with your socks on, your socks!

488
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,983
No, no, give me your hand. Give me your hand.

489
00:37:32,567 --> 00:37:33,818
Give me your hand...

490
00:37:34,735 --> 00:37:37,028
You'll pull me in. No, no...

491
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,655
You're all right. I won't let you go.

492
00:37:42,032 --> 00:37:43,283
Let me get you dry. You're all right.

493
00:37:45,243 --> 00:37:50,874
Where are your socks? Socks? No?

494
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:52,709
Uppy, uppy hands. Uppy hands. Let's get it on.

495
00:37:53,377 --> 00:37:54,460
That's it.

496
00:37:55,336 --> 00:37:59,713
Iris, come on. Just put your hand...

497
00:38:00,297 --> 00:38:01,381
...like this. Up hand. Up.

498
00:38:01,881 --> 00:38:03,800
-Let's get your head through.
-Let's go now.

499
00:38:04,342 --> 00:38:05,593
No, let's go now.

500
00:38:06,094 --> 00:38:07,220
Iris, as soon as we've got your head in! Iris.

501
00:38:07,512 --> 00:38:08,846
-Let's go now...
-Put your head down.

502
00:38:09,222 --> 00:38:10,765
Where's my petticoat?

503
00:38:11,932 --> 00:38:12,933
Here.

504
00:38:19,981 --> 00:38:21,107
Are you sure he's expecting me?

505
00:38:35,867 --> 00:38:36,952
Maurice.

506
00:38:37,244 --> 00:38:38,370
I've brought John. You said I might...?

507
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,623
Did I? And did you say you would?

508
00:38:43,834 --> 00:38:45,333
Yes. Well...come in.

509
00:38:46,126 --> 00:38:48,169
-Maurice Charlton.
-John Bayley.

510
00:38:55,426 --> 00:38:56,635
Isn't it hot?

511
00:38:57,011 --> 00:38:59,846
Yes, Itis. I've got just the thing will cool.

512
00:39:03,682 --> 00:39:06,518
I imagine your friend
Maurice is hoping to have his wicked will, is he?

513
00:39:07,769 --> 00:39:08,894
Not today, is he?

514
00:39:19,028 --> 00:39:21,155
You and I
are much the some age, aren't we, John?

515
00:39:22,072 --> 00:39:23,657
I think so.

516
00:39:24,533 --> 00:39:25,534
Does it matter?

517
00:39:26,327 --> 00:39:27,328
No.

518
00:39:27,661 --> 00:39:28,871
It's not important, is it?

519
00:39:30,038 --> 00:39:31,414
What Maurice means is that most of my real...

520
00:39:32,915 --> 00:39:34,874
...my other friends are -- older than me.

521
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:36,958
Much older.

522
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:39,669
Yes, and there's a
very good reason for that, isn't there?

523
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:44,215
She likes people with a bit of a past.

524
00:39:45,342 --> 00:39:46,927
She uses them... Don't you?

525
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,219
No I don't.

526
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:50,347
For your novel, don't you Iris?

527
00:39:50,764 --> 00:39:52,640
-I haven't read it
-Haven't you?

528
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,891
Neither have you Maurice, so don't play games.

529
00:39:55,558 --> 00:39:56,642
Nobody reads it.

530
00:39:59,727 --> 00:40:02,355
The gentle lady hasn't yet
bestowed her favour on anyone.

531
00:40:03,022 --> 00:40:04,941
Iris doesn't like to talk about it. Do you Iris?

532
00:40:06,567 --> 00:40:09,237
It's because it's full of people she knows.

533
00:40:09,653 --> 00:40:11,655
All these masters of thought
you're so chummy with.

534
00:40:13,073 --> 00:40:16,492
Bound to be. We all know. Isn't it, Iris?

535
00:40:17,701 --> 00:40:20,078
No. You can think what you like,
you know nothing about it.

536
00:40:20,536 --> 00:40:21,537
Nobody knows but me.

537
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,791
And -- I'm not telling.

538
00:40:25,083 --> 00:40:26,500
I thought it was as secret?

539
00:40:26,917 --> 00:40:28,751
I know Iris doesn't want it talked about.

540
00:40:29,168 --> 00:40:31,379
Come on, Iris,
I'm sure we'll all recognise ourselves.

541
00:40:32,171 --> 00:40:34,798
I don't see how you -- anyone can.

542
00:40:35,173 --> 00:40:37,425
They won't. They won't.

543
00:40:38,093 --> 00:40:40,053
I hate that sort of thing. I won't ever do it.

544
00:40:40,262 --> 00:40:41,388
I don't see the point
of writing a novel that's autobiography.

545
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,681
There's no fun in that.

546
00:40:43,098 --> 00:40:44,430
They won't see themselves.

547
00:40:44,931 --> 00:40:47,767
Don't people written about in novels
always see themselves differently?

548
00:40:48,393 --> 00:40:50,186
-I'm sure they do, but...
-And who was it who said:

549
00:40:50,812 --> 00:40:52,438
"You can use anyone you like in a novel...

550
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:54,773
...as long as you
drop it in somewhere that they're good in bed...

551
00:40:55,607 --> 00:40:57,025
-...even though..."
-...they might not be.

552
00:41:00,527 --> 00:41:01,570
Evelyn Waugh.

553
00:41:01,861 --> 00:41:03,613
"And so to bed." Samuel Pepys.

554
00:41:05,574 --> 00:41:07,241
So, have you granted your favour to John?

555
00:41:08,867 --> 00:41:10,160
Told him who's in the novel?

556
00:41:10,953 --> 00:41:14,122
We have other things to talk about.

557
00:41:18,208 --> 00:41:19,418
No-one has read my novel.

558
00:41:20,002 --> 00:41:21,670
-No-one but the publisher.
-It doesn't matter.

559
00:41:22,004 --> 00:41:23,964
Well, it does matter, I feel let down.

560
00:41:25,048 --> 00:41:27,758
Am I not a small part of your life?

561
00:41:36,139 --> 00:41:37,390
You were very gallant.

562
00:41:37,974 --> 00:41:39,601
Very stupid.

563
00:41:39,767 --> 00:41:40,768
No, John.

564
00:41:46,774 --> 00:41:47,775
Will you come in?

565
00:41:54,155 --> 00:41:55,739
Have you been entertained?

566
00:41:56,364 --> 00:41:57,740
Yes.

567
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:00,659
All these people...

568
00:42:00,993 --> 00:42:05,539
...and to think I chose you
for your obvious lack of...

569
00:42:05,998 --> 00:42:07,124
thought that... I thought no competition.

570
00:42:08,208 --> 00:42:09,209
What's this?

571
00:42:09,542 --> 00:42:10,793
A friend made it.

572
00:42:11,252 --> 00:42:12,669
Is she a cook, your friend?

573
00:42:13,462 --> 00:42:16,131
No, he's ap hilosopher. But
his real interests are cooking and telephones.

574
00:42:18,633 --> 00:42:20,801
I'd like you to read this.

575
00:42:23,304 --> 00:42:26,056
I was rather afraid you might not like it.

576
00:42:29,808 --> 00:42:31,018
Thank you.

577
00:42:33,853 --> 00:42:35,188
I value your opinion.

578
00:42:41,817 --> 00:42:43,986
Perhaps it's time we made love?

579
00:42:44,612 --> 00:42:45,613
Yes?

580
00:42:45,905 --> 00:42:48,491
Yes. That's what I thought.

581
00:42:50,535 --> 00:42:52,160
Have you got a French letter?

582
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:55,664
A rubber thingy?

583
00:42:56,747 --> 00:42:58,165
Oh, good Lord, no.

584
00:42:59,123 --> 00:43:00,124
Well...

585
00:43:06,171 --> 00:43:08,215
...we'll just have to be careful.

586
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:33,568
I don't exactly...

587
00:43:34,902 --> 00:43:37,280
Probably easier if you take your trousers off.

588
00:43:38,114 --> 00:43:42,618
Yes, of course. I've never...

589
00:43:43,244 --> 00:43:45,997
I'm a rather late starter.

590
00:43:46,497 --> 00:43:47,582
My brother used to have to...

591
00:43:48,666 --> 00:43:51,000
...tie my shoelaces for me till I was seven.

592
00:43:51,375 --> 00:43:53,418
-I don't know if...
-I do.

593
00:43:56,086 --> 00:43:57,504
It'll all go...

594
00:44:00,924 --> 00:44:01,884
swimmingly.

595
00:44:02,718 --> 00:44:03,719
-Help.
-No, no, no.

596
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:07,805
Iris, calm down. No.

597
00:44:08,556 --> 00:44:12,601
No. Help, help.

598
00:44:13,059 --> 00:44:14,769
I am trying to help you.

599
00:44:53,801 --> 00:44:57,261
Sorry.

600
00:44:57,637 --> 00:45:00,056
Please don't, Iris.

601
00:45:02,808 --> 00:45:07,145
You have nothing to be sorry about.

602
00:45:09,397 --> 00:45:11,899
It'd be unfair and I couldn't bear it.

603
00:45:14,234 --> 00:45:17,904
We should be saying sorry to you.

604
00:45:19,781 --> 00:45:23,368
And not just sorry, but...

605
00:45:28,579 --> 00:45:33,666
Shall I read to you? Shall I?

606
00:45:40,589 --> 00:45:44,552
Occupied in observing
Mr Bingley's attentions to her sister...

607
00:45:44,927 --> 00:45:46,637
Elizabeth was far from suspecting...

608
00:45:47,137 --> 00:45:50,681
...that she was herself
becoming an object of some interest...

609
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:52,932
...in the eyes of his friend.

610
00:45:54,766 --> 00:45:58,979
Mr Darcy had, at first,
scarcely allowed her to be pretty...

611
00:45:59,729 --> 00:46:01,481
I wrote.

612
00:46:03,817 --> 00:46:06,735
Yes, my darling clever cat.

613
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:09,112
You wrote books.

614
00:46:09,988 --> 00:46:12,323
Books. I wrote.

615
00:46:13,408 --> 00:46:15,242
You wrote novels.

616
00:46:15,868 --> 00:46:17,244
Wonderful novels.

617
00:46:20,205 --> 00:46:21,873
I wrote.

618
00:46:22,999 --> 00:46:24,624
Such things you wrote.

619
00:46:26,459 --> 00:46:28,044
Special things...

620
00:46:28,919 --> 00:46:30,296
...secret things.

621
00:46:38,802 --> 00:46:43,056
Do you know many secrets now, Iris?

622
00:46:44,892 --> 00:46:47,352
You have shown me a map of Iris'...

623
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:49,979
...brain world. Empty...

624
00:46:51,022 --> 00:46:53,398
You tell me that its hidden mysteries and ...

625
00:46:54,691 --> 00:46:58,152
...and all the unknown life
in there has gone, has been wiped.

626
00:46:59,403 --> 00:47:00,821
How then...

627
00:47:01,322 --> 00:47:04,657
How can she say things
with such a terrible lucidity?

628
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:08,577
Which bit of the empty jungle
does that come from?

629
00:47:10,037 --> 00:47:12,914
-We don't know.
-Not we. You don't know.

630
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,958
Don't hide, please.

631
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:20,922
Is it not remotely possible...

632
00:47:22,465 --> 00:47:26,175
...that what Iris says
is of some consequence, yes?

633
00:47:27,092 --> 00:47:28,426
yes, perhaps.

634
00:47:28,801 --> 00:47:33,138
So, perhaps we ought to learn her language...

635
00:47:34,014 --> 00:47:35,766
...before the lights go out.

636
00:47:36,767 --> 00:47:38,811
The lights -- will go out.

637
00:47:39,228 --> 00:47:40,187
Yes, of course they will.

638
00:47:40,479 --> 00:47:41,980
You all keep telling me, us, that.

639
00:47:42,231 --> 00:47:44,107
I know that. She may even know that herself.

640
00:47:46,526 --> 00:47:47,526
Iris.

641
00:47:51,529 --> 00:47:54,239
I'm sure you can write it.
Just get one word down.

642
00:47:54,864 --> 00:47:55,865
Persevere.

643
00:47:56,908 --> 00:47:58,326
Iris, your notebook!

644
00:48:13,089 --> 00:48:15,257
No, Iris. No, no. Come, come.

645
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:19,261
That's it.

646
00:48:23,721 --> 00:48:26,850
we'll walk -- we'll read...

647
00:48:27,641 --> 00:48:34,273
...and then you'll write. Be just like the old days.

648
00:48:41,945 --> 00:48:43,238
It's Iris, mama.

649
00:48:47,575 --> 00:48:48,534
Look who's here, Iris.

650
00:48:48,993 --> 00:48:51,661
Hello. Hello.

651
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:04,964
Yes, Iris, sea.

652
00:49:05,631 --> 00:49:07,424
I thought we'd walk, calm her down a bit.

653
00:49:07,799 --> 00:49:09,801
She has an idea for a novel.

654
00:49:10,302 --> 00:49:11,719
-Hello, Iris.
-Hello, Iris.

655
00:49:12,845 --> 00:49:14,346
Talk to her, Janet.

656
00:49:15,598 --> 00:49:18,726
Hello, Iris. The sea's a bit cold for swimming.

657
00:49:20,311 --> 00:49:22,145
Stay as long as you like, there's plenty of room.

658
00:49:22,645 --> 00:49:25,189
-We don't want to be nuisance...
-Oh, no you're not!

659
00:49:25,606 --> 00:49:27,106
It's as much for mum as anyone,
give her a bit of a rest.

660
00:49:27,939 --> 00:49:30,942
Can't rush around these days,
John, tummy trouble.

661
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,113
-Is she ill?
-She gets tired easily.

662
00:49:36,072 --> 00:49:37,365
She's really not...

663
00:49:41,828 --> 00:49:42,829
What do we do?

664
00:49:42,913 --> 00:49:43,914
Just talk to her.

665
00:49:44,206 --> 00:49:46,331
Say things to her
that she can write. She can you know.

666
00:51:13,861 --> 00:51:14,862
It's all right, is it, John?

667
00:51:17,531 --> 00:51:19,491
It'll get better
as you get to know each other better.

668
00:51:24,202 --> 00:51:27,078
Iris has got more than one world
going on inside her head...

669
00:51:27,412 --> 00:51:29,205
...a secret world.

670
00:51:30,415 --> 00:51:31,749
Until another book comes out.

671
00:51:33,626 --> 00:51:35,336
I'm only friend that knows of her secret world.

672
00:51:35,795 --> 00:51:37,046
Oh, John.

673
00:51:37,338 --> 00:51:38,590
No, no, it's like living in a fairy story.

674
00:51:39,757 --> 00:51:41,843
I'm the young man in love
with a beautiful maiden...

675
00:51:42,427 --> 00:51:45,261
...who disappears into an unknown
and mysterious world...

676
00:51:45,636 --> 00:51:48,430
...but who always comes back.

677
00:51:57,646 --> 00:51:59,148
Iris!

678
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,232
Look.

679
00:52:01,566 --> 00:52:04,651
Iris, look, he's got his clothes on.

680
00:52:04,902 --> 00:52:06,403
He's got his clothes on!

681
00:52:06,904 --> 00:52:12,241
He's got his clothes on. He's got his clothes on.

682
00:52:12,784 --> 00:52:15,119
Seems very sensible to me.

683
00:53:02,658 --> 00:53:04,450
-Janet, are you all right?
-I'm absolutely fine, John.

684
00:53:04,617 --> 00:53:07,577
I thought I'd get her to sign this.

685
00:53:09,329 --> 00:53:12,624
Anything is fine. Just get her to write.

686
00:53:14,251 --> 00:53:15,836
Does she know anything about her past?

687
00:53:17,295 --> 00:53:18,838
Her career, work, friends?

688
00:53:19,964 --> 00:53:22,382
Something of a closed book.

689
00:53:24,298 --> 00:53:26,634
But it's there -- I know it.

690
00:53:45,817 --> 00:53:47,526
Oh, that's wonderful. Well done, puss.

691
00:53:49,653 --> 00:53:52,489
Good to see your book so well received, Iris.

692
00:53:53,115 --> 00:53:54,283
Yes, wasn't it?

693
00:53:54,616 --> 00:53:56,243
You thought you'd never finish it, didn't you?

694
00:53:57,077 --> 00:53:58,119
I read her the reviews.

695
00:53:58,953 --> 00:54:02,664
You hated me doing it before.

696
00:54:03,123 --> 00:54:04,833
Would you sign your new book for me, Iris?

697
00:54:07,002 --> 00:54:09,044
Like postcards, do it at once or you don't.

698
00:54:09,962 --> 00:54:11,464
Please?

699
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:48,868
I see an angel.

700
00:54:50,411 --> 00:54:51,704
I think it's you.

701
00:55:02,046 --> 00:55:03,130
We're undewater now.

702
00:55:05,508 --> 00:55:07,467
There are some drugs, aren't there, Iris?

703
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:09,594
But they don't last long.

704
00:55:10,387 --> 00:55:13,056
And when the friendly fog disperses...

705
00:55:14,307 --> 00:55:17,267
...there yawns
the precipice before you, doesn't it, puss?

706
00:55:21,062 --> 00:55:22,104
They're beautiful.

707
00:55:24,063 --> 00:55:25,731
Horrible, isn't it, puss?

708
00:55:26,482 --> 00:55:29,777
Horrible thing...

709
00:55:30,111 --> 00:55:32,613
...when you're there
with your toes at the edge of the precipice.

710
00:55:35,741 --> 00:55:37,243
You can say anything you like as...

711
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:38,828
...long as you make it sound like it's a joke.

712
00:55:39,078 --> 00:55:40,078
Oh, don't John, that's cruel.

713
00:55:40,578 --> 00:55:41,745
that's where you're wrong.

714
00:55:41,912 --> 00:55:43,079
It's not cruel, it's nothing...

715
00:55:43,371 --> 00:55:44,414
...because it's not understood.

716
00:55:44,622 --> 00:55:46,248
She's in her own world now.

717
00:55:48,291 --> 00:55:50,377
Which is perhaps what she's always wanted.

718
00:56:00,428 --> 00:56:03,179
Come on. Let's go in.

719
00:56:38,792 --> 00:56:40,251
When do we go?

720
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:21,992
Chin up, John.

721
00:57:27,998 --> 00:57:28,999
Janet.

722
00:57:29,333 --> 00:57:30,584
Yes, puss. Yes.

723
00:57:50,975 --> 00:57:53,561
Going, going. No, I do go.

724
00:57:54,937 --> 00:57:57,356
Soon, we'll -- we'll go soon.

725
00:57:59,399 --> 00:58:02,026
Now... now.

726
00:58:05,654 --> 00:58:08,532
Who is it? Who is it?

727
00:58:09,491 --> 00:58:11,368
Hello, hello.

728
00:58:11,784 --> 00:58:13,160
Are you there?

729
00:58:14,494 --> 00:58:15,495
Where this?

730
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:25,838
...soars enchanted...

731
00:58:27,715 --> 00:58:30,632
As I hear the sweet lark sing

732
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:33,260
In the clear air of the day.

733
00:58:33,552 --> 00:58:36,304
How much is that doggy in the window?

734
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,807
The one with the waggly tail

735
00:58:41,058 --> 00:58:44,269
How much is that doggy in the window?

736
00:58:44,936 --> 00:58:52,358
I do hope that doggy's for sale.

737
00:58:57,405 --> 00:58:58,405
Sing your mother's song.

738
00:59:00,407 --> 00:59:01,700
Sing your mother's song.

739
00:59:03,534 --> 00:59:06,245
All my soul's adoration.

740
00:59:07,288 --> 00:59:10,750
And I think he will hear me.

741
00:59:11,792 --> 00:59:15,503
...soars enchanted

742
00:59:15,962 --> 00:59:22,799
I hear the sweet lark sing...

743
00:59:25,302 --> 00:59:26,762
...of the day.

744
00:59:28,388 --> 00:59:31,558
It is this that gives my soul.

745
00:59:32,434 --> 00:59:36,146
All its joyous elation

746
00:59:36,937 --> 00:59:41,231
As I hear the sweet lark sing

747
00:59:41,857 --> 00:59:44,609
In the clear air...

748
00:59:45,276 --> 00:59:47,362
...of the day.

749
00:59:48,821 --> 00:59:52,950
Dear thoughts are in my mind

750
00:59:54,659 --> 00:59:58,913
And my soul soars enchanted.

751
00:59:59,914 --> 01:00:04,459
As I hear the sweet lark sing

752
01:00:05,168 --> 01:00:09,964
In the clear air of the day.

753
01:00:11,298 --> 01:00:15,134
For a tender beaming smile...

754
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:19,971
...to my hope has been granted

755
01:00:21,807 --> 01:00:26,311
And tomorrow he shall hear...

756
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:33,483
...all my fond heart can say

757
01:00:34,150 --> 01:00:38,195
As I hear the sweet lark sing...

758
01:00:38,654 --> 01:00:41,240
...in the...

759
01:01:00,921 --> 01:01:02,464
Come, gentlemen...

760
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:05,217
...we shall have to do better than this.

761
01:01:18,143 --> 01:01:20,145
aren't you a bad cat?

762
01:01:28,111 --> 01:01:31,239
And tomorrow he shall hear...

763
01:01:31,573 --> 01:01:36,534
...all my fond heart can say

764
01:01:37,035 --> 01:01:38,243
Teletubbies!

765
01:01:43,706 --> 01:01:44,665
Morning.

766
01:01:45,041 --> 01:01:46,459
Morning. Oh thank you.

767
01:01:47,418 --> 01:01:50,338
-Okay. Bye.
-Than kyou. Bye.

768
01:01:52,213 --> 01:01:53,423
It's only the postman.

769
01:01:58,677 --> 01:01:59,762
Time for teletubbies -- Time for Teletubbies.

770
01:01:59,970 --> 01:02:00,971
Tinky winky Tinky Winky

771
01:02:01,263 --> 01:02:05,558
It's only the postman.

772
01:02:07,518 --> 01:02:08,518
It'sonlythepostman.

773
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:12,813
It's only the postman.

774
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,275
It's only the postman.

775
01:02:47,050 --> 01:02:48,885
Where have the Teletubbies gone?

776
01:03:03,855 --> 01:03:04,898
remember Proteus?

777
01:03:05,273 --> 01:03:07,317
-What about Proteus?
-I'm like Proteus.

778
01:03:07,651 --> 01:03:10,194
You've got to keep hold of me
the way Hercules kept hold of him.

779
01:03:10,903 --> 01:03:12,029
Even thought he changed into...

780
01:03:12,363 --> 01:03:14,114
... a lion and a fish...

781
01:03:14,364 --> 01:03:15,364
...and a snake.

782
01:03:58,817 --> 01:04:01,610
I'm worried about the river, we swim.

783
01:04:05,239 --> 01:04:06,240
You never know, sir.

784
01:04:32,678 --> 01:04:35,930
I have, of course,
looked everywhere here already.

785
01:04:57,198 --> 01:04:58,698
Everything you do...

786
01:04:59,574 --> 01:05:02,160
...everything you say, write...

787
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:05,664
...you do it superbly.

788
01:05:06,873 --> 01:05:09,124
And you're always going to, all your life...

789
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:11,125
...whatever you turn your hand to. I know it.

790
01:05:14,585 --> 01:05:17,922
And I know you must feel
that I don't belong in your world.

791
01:05:19,090 --> 01:05:22,051
I don't.

792
01:06:22,018 --> 01:06:23,267
Between the soup and the baked beans.

793
01:06:24,018 --> 01:06:25,561
Thank you so much.

794
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:28,022
I caught her before she got to the check-out.

795
01:06:28,522 --> 01:06:30,316
She's been gone for hours...

796
01:06:30,524 --> 01:06:31,650
..I thought I'd never see her again. Never.

797
01:06:33,318 --> 01:06:34,694
Well... all's well that...

798
01:06:35,069 --> 01:06:36,945
Please do, tell me your name?

799
01:06:39,822 --> 01:06:41,282
I'm Maurice, John.

800
01:06:43,701 --> 01:06:44,827
Iris' friend.

801
01:06:45,994 --> 01:06:47,829
I was a witness at your wedding.

802
01:06:50,457 --> 01:06:51,999
Well, I'm late for a meeting.

803
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:56,169
-Maurice, so sorry...
-So sorry.

804
01:07:28,322 --> 01:07:30,823
Were you trying to get away from me?

805
01:07:32,658 --> 01:07:35,576
Did you want to leave me, Iris?

806
01:07:38,078 --> 01:07:39,746
Please?

807
01:07:54,968 --> 01:07:57,928
I feel as if I don't know anything about you.

808
01:07:58,262 --> 01:07:59,513
When you know
everything about me, then I'll be dead.

809
01:08:00,472 --> 01:08:01,765
He's a Professor of Ancient History..

810
01:08:02,224 --> 01:08:04,058
They have a maling influence on you I think.

811
01:08:04,308 --> 01:08:05,518
They all have, all your 'friends'.

812
01:08:05,892 --> 01:08:07,936
He's a teacher, a master of thought.

813
01:08:08,561 --> 01:08:10,729
You talk, do you. You master thoughts together?

814
01:08:11,397 --> 01:08:13,482
We make love, yes,
but that's not the important thing.

815
01:08:13,774 --> 01:08:15,150
Then he goes home to his wife in London.

816
01:08:15,943 --> 01:08:16,902
Does it frighten you?

817
01:08:17,444 --> 01:08:20,862
I feel as if I'm standing in a long line of suitors...

818
01:08:21,071 --> 01:08:22,239
...waiting for a kind word.

819
01:08:23,115 --> 01:08:24,157
I'll always give you a kind word.

820
01:08:25,242 --> 01:08:26,702
We must accept me as I am.

821
01:08:27,494 --> 01:08:29,663
And I'm to be kept in my box or not kept at all.

822
01:08:30,122 --> 01:08:32,915
Nothing matters except...

823
01:08:34,125 --> 01:08:35,417
...loving what is good.

824
01:08:35,875 --> 01:08:36,876
Am I good?

825
01:08:39,336 --> 01:08:41,213
Just...

826
01:08:41,505 --> 01:08:44,215
...keep tight hold of me and it'll be all right.

827
01:08:50,637 --> 01:08:53,140
Who are you with now, Iris?

828
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:54,141
Who is it?

829
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:03,107
We're lost.

830
01:09:04,483 --> 01:09:06,651
We're lost. We're lost...

831
01:09:16,658 --> 01:09:17,993
There is no reason for this.

832
01:09:18,327 --> 01:09:19,953
And if there is I don't know it.

833
01:09:20,871 --> 01:09:24,207
I hate you Iris. You stupid cow.

834
01:09:24,625 --> 01:09:26,043
I bloody loathe you.

835
01:09:26,335 --> 01:09:28,461
Every bloody inch of you.

836
01:09:29,003 --> 01:09:31,670
All your friends have finished with you.

837
01:09:32,087 --> 01:09:34,881
Nobody else has you anymore...

838
01:09:35,381 --> 01:09:40,053
...except your fucking best friend
Doctor fucking Alzheimer....

839
01:09:40,428 --> 01:09:43,056
...with all his fucking gifts.

840
01:09:43,514 --> 01:09:46,642
I've got you now and I don't want you.

841
01:09:47,935 --> 01:09:50,186
I've never known anything about you at all...

842
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:51,979
...and now I don't care.

843
01:10:01,696 --> 01:10:02,780
I think it's time I told you about...

844
01:10:02,905 --> 01:10:03,906
...some of my friends...

845
01:10:04,989 --> 01:10:07,450
...the people in my past -- of my heart and...

846
01:10:08,326 --> 01:10:09,284
...and not.

847
01:10:11,870 --> 01:10:12,829
Oh dear.

848
01:10:20,335 --> 01:10:21,753
ought I to take notes?

849
01:10:29,593 --> 01:10:31,512
There was a friend who was a student with me.

850
01:10:33,763 --> 01:10:35,348
No, no, he can wait.

851
01:10:37,975 --> 01:10:39,977
He was not the first person I went to bed with...

852
01:10:40,852 --> 01:10:42,020
...that was Harry..

853
01:10:43,396 --> 01:10:46,023
then there was Roger,
who wanted to marry me...

854
01:10:46,857 --> 01:10:49,401
And Oscar
who said he couldn't live without me...

855
01:10:50,735 --> 01:10:52,237
...and Tom...

856
01:10:53,779 --> 01:10:58,033
...who far too clearly could but...

857
01:10:58,367 --> 01:11:01,328
So, the student friend
I had resisted going to bed with...

858
01:11:03,204 --> 01:11:04,581
...joined the Army during the war....

859
01:11:04,914 --> 01:11:06,040
...and promptly asked me to marry him for...

860
01:11:07,875 --> 01:11:09,500
...he was certain he was going to be killed...

861
01:11:09,791 --> 01:11:11,167
..and wanted me to have the window's pension.

862
01:11:13,086 --> 01:11:14,379
Yes, I know they all said that.

863
01:11:16,047 --> 01:11:17,007
Anyway...

864
01:11:18,967 --> 01:11:20,385
...I didn't want to marry him...

865
01:11:22,387 --> 01:11:24,139
...but I did go to bed with him.

866
01:11:24,764 --> 01:11:29,017
...I thought that best before
he went off to fight, because you never know...

867
01:11:34,437 --> 01:11:36,147
...anyway, he, he was killed--

868
01:11:36,939 --> 01:11:38,316
--my student friend...

869
01:11:40,151 --> 01:11:41,569
...and we weren't married.

870
01:11:44,279 --> 01:11:45,530
So no pension.

871
01:11:53,828 --> 01:11:54,829
there.

872
01:11:55,038 --> 01:11:56,122
It wouldn't have been much anyway...

873
01:11:56,331 --> 01:11:57,749
I know, because I had friends killed.

874
01:11:58,082 --> 01:12:00,292
Their wives got very little, they get very little.

875
01:12:05,087 --> 01:12:07,422
Is that all? I mean, roughly?

876
01:12:09,716 --> 01:12:11,927
What about the 'friends' in your other world?

877
01:12:13,261 --> 01:12:14,721
You know more about me than anyone on earth.

878
01:12:19,057 --> 01:12:20,266
You are my world.

879
01:12:42,743 --> 01:12:43,744
Thank you.

880
01:12:45,496 --> 01:12:47,664
After all that I rather hoped it might be time...

881
01:12:47,997 --> 01:12:49,290
...for me to get my kind word.

882
01:12:56,004 --> 01:12:58,465
You don't need to do it on your own.
Vale House is very good.

883
01:12:59,424 --> 01:13:00,801
You're exhausted, you know that.

884
01:13:01,176 --> 01:13:03,135
Of course I am. It's something that we share.

885
01:13:03,511 --> 01:13:05,762
We're in a state of grace.

886
01:13:06,346 --> 01:13:07,971
I think we understand each other.

887
01:13:09,055 --> 01:13:10,098
What do you think?

888
01:13:11,140 --> 01:13:15,436
I don'tknow. There's always help if you need it.

889
01:13:16,604 --> 01:13:19,315
There isn't any help for her.

890
01:13:22,735 --> 01:13:23,736
What?

891
01:13:24,529 --> 01:13:26,487
Sorry? Sorry?

892
01:13:27,071 --> 01:13:28,280
Nothing.

893
01:13:37,621 --> 01:13:38,622
Why has Willie Thorne
got two rabbits tattooed on his bald head?

894
01:13:39,456 --> 01:13:41,958
I don't know, why has Willie Thorne
got two rabbits tattooed on his bald head?

895
01:13:42,542 --> 01:13:44,836
Cos from a distance they look like hares.

896
01:13:49,381 --> 01:13:50,591
Janet's dead, Iris.

897
01:13:55,595 --> 01:13:58,055
They want me to say a few words
but I can't think of any.

898
01:13:58,598 --> 01:14:00,973
Janet's dead, Iris.

899
01:14:11,733 --> 01:14:15,278
I miss Janet very much.

900
01:14:16,402 --> 01:14:20,823
I miss Janet because I used to store up...

901
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:23,284
...funny things to tell her that happened to us.

902
01:14:25,244 --> 01:14:27,162
...things I can no longer tell Iris.

903
01:14:28,830 --> 01:14:31,040
Another friend visited us...

904
01:14:31,332 --> 01:14:32,499
...in Oxford overnight recently....

905
01:14:33,249 --> 01:14:35,502
...and I found her cleaning the bath.

906
01:14:36,753 --> 01:14:38,880
I said, "Oh, please, there's no need".

907
01:14:39,838 --> 01:14:41,924
She said, "Oh yes there is,
I want to take a bath".

908
01:14:47,053 --> 01:14:48,513
I was hoping to be able...

909
01:14:49,721 --> 01:14:51,056
...to tell Janet that story...

910
01:14:51,765 --> 01:14:53,808
...she would have enjoyed it.

911
01:14:54,851 --> 01:14:56,895
She would have...laughed.

912
01:14:59,523 --> 01:15:00,564
I mean, I think...

913
01:15:06,151 --> 01:15:09,237
...Anna Karenina, Tolstoy, you know...

914
01:15:09,529 --> 01:15:13,282
...when on her way to the station
to throw herself under a train...

915
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:16,744
...sees something funny
which she thinks to tell Vronsky....

916
01:15:17,245 --> 01:15:18,204
...her lover, about...

917
01:15:18,788 --> 01:15:20,706
...we all do it, I do it with Iris...

918
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:22,083
...and Janet, all our friends...

919
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:28,503
...but, then Anna thought that
she wouldn't be seeing Vronsky again...

920
01:15:29,128 --> 01:15:31,338
...because she was about to kill herself.

921
01:15:35,843 --> 01:15:36,927
Oh, but, you don't want to hear this...

922
01:15:40,013 --> 01:15:42,306
...Janet didn't kill herself...

923
01:15:46,643 --> 01:15:51,021
But, if there's one thing
that would have prevented...

924
01:15:52,022 --> 01:15:54,942
...Anna from throwing herself under a train...

925
01:15:55,776 --> 01:16:00,696
...that would be it,
the thought of telling something funny...

926
01:16:02,364 --> 01:16:04,365
...to the man she loves.

927
01:16:08,536 --> 01:16:10,288
The love is over...

928
01:16:14,498 --> 01:16:17,877
...though...

929
01:16:20,171 --> 01:16:21,839
...life will...

930
01:16:23,299 --> 01:16:24,883
...soon be over.

931
01:16:27,302 --> 01:16:28,261
That's all.

932
01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:32,263
Goodbye, Janet.

933
01:16:32,805 --> 01:16:34,807
No, no, Janet. Jan!

934
01:16:35,516 --> 01:16:37,268
It's all right, Iris.

935
01:16:49,027 --> 01:16:49,986
Wrong, wrong, wrong.

936
01:16:50,236 --> 01:16:51,529
-Wrong driving.
Stop it, Iris!

937
01:16:51,905 --> 01:16:52,906
Wrong driving!

938
01:16:53,031 --> 01:16:54,032
No. Stop it, Iris.

939
01:16:54,365 --> 01:16:58,327
-Not house. Not mother..
-Iris, it's very dangerous.

940
01:16:58,619 --> 01:17:02,288
Them! Them!

941
01:17:05,039 --> 01:17:06,040
Iris!

942
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:13,839
Puss.

943
01:17:16,091 --> 01:17:18,844
My old mouse -- My old cat mouse.

944
01:17:19,428 --> 01:17:20,429
Where are you?

945
01:17:48,576 --> 01:17:50,494
I...

946
01:17:53,455 --> 01:17:55,249
...love...

947
01:17:57,208 --> 01:17:58,333
...you.

948
01:18:00,377 --> 01:18:06,340
Ah, little mouse. I know you do.

949
01:18:21,728 --> 01:18:23,062
I used to be...

950
01:18:23,938 --> 01:18:26,566
...so afraid of being alone with you...

951
01:18:27,315 --> 01:18:29,025
...now I can't be without you.

952
01:18:38,825 --> 01:18:40,910
Let's get us -- home...

953
01:18:42,161 --> 01:18:44,455
...and then there'll be tomorrow...

954
01:18:46,289 --> 01:18:47,957
...and the nex tday...

955
01:18:49,292 --> 01:18:50,376
...and the next...

956
01:18:51,127 --> 01:18:52,462
...and on we go...

957
01:18:54,797 --> 01:18:59,092
...getting closer and closest together...

958
01:19:01,718 --> 01:19:02,719
Oh, your ring.

959
01:19:04,011 --> 01:19:05,471
It's so worn now.

960
01:19:05,804 --> 01:19:06,763
Where did you get it?

961
01:19:06,972 --> 01:19:07,973
From a pawnbrokers.

962
01:19:09,641 --> 01:19:11,018
I like things that are worn down.

963
01:19:13,061 --> 01:19:15,314
Which wear and wear and wear...

964
01:19:18,442 --> 01:19:19,735
...until they go.

965
01:19:37,748 --> 01:19:38,832
We've had a bit of luck.

966
01:19:39,792 --> 01:19:41,876
Usual thing, I'm afraid -- Somebody's died.

967
01:19:44,378 --> 01:19:45,379
Iris...

968
01:19:46,172 --> 01:19:49,174
...don't you have a smile for Doctor Gudgeon?

969
01:19:50,342 --> 01:19:51,301
No?

970
01:19:54,762 --> 01:19:55,763
No.

971
01:19:56,346 --> 01:19:58,890
So -- the time has come.

972
01:20:01,850 --> 01:20:03,268
You know it would, Professor Bayley.

973
01:20:04,103 --> 01:20:05,104
Yes.

974
01:20:06,021 --> 01:20:08,649
She didn't have a smile for you today.

975
01:20:09,316 --> 01:20:12,484
Yes. Well, we must make a start.

976
01:20:14,027 --> 01:20:15,821
-What do I do?
-Nothing any more.

977
01:20:19,533 --> 01:20:21,534
Vale House is a very friendly place, you know.

978
01:20:23,077 --> 01:20:24,328
I was, surpr....

979
01:20:26,204 --> 01:20:27,538
...I mean, this is one of the best.

980
01:20:30,290 --> 01:20:33,502
More difficult to get into than...well, Eton.

981
01:21:14,661 --> 01:21:16,746
-Taxi for Vale House?
-Yes.

982
01:21:18,456 --> 01:21:20,498
Lady's on the stairs, but I can't get her down.

983
01:21:22,249 --> 01:21:23,208
Shall I?

984
01:21:29,756 --> 01:21:32,300
You all right, my love?

985
01:21:34,552 --> 01:21:35,886
We're going for a little drive.

986
01:21:38,472 --> 01:21:39,472
What's your name then?

987
01:21:44,518 --> 01:21:45,518
Iris.

988
01:21:47,854 --> 01:21:49,647
Yes, it's Iris.

989
01:21:50,940 --> 01:21:51,983
All right then, Iris...

990
01:21:53,025 --> 01:21:54,567
...you'll be all right, my love, come on.

991
01:21:54,609 --> 01:21:55,610
Come on, upsy-daisy.

992
01:22:02,365 --> 01:22:03,366
There you go.

993
01:22:04,076 --> 01:22:05,911
Lovely.

994
01:22:32,890 --> 01:22:34,433
Human beings love each...

995
01:22:35,226 --> 01:22:37,144
...in sex -- in friendship...

996
01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:39,771
...and when they're in love.

997
01:22:41,147 --> 01:22:42,898
And they cherish other beings...

998
01:22:43,649 --> 01:22:46,693
...humans -- animals, plants...

999
01:22:48,487 --> 01:22:49,696
...even stones.

1000
01:22:50,447 --> 01:22:52,491
She'll be fine now, won't you Iris?

1001
01:22:55,159 --> 01:22:56,868
You can visit any time you like...

1002
01:22:57,244 --> 01:22:58,619
...come all day if you want to.

1003
01:23:03,832 --> 01:23:05,500
Stay the night, that's all right...

1004
01:23:06,126 --> 01:23:08,294
...we can make arrangements
for you to do that anytime.

1005
01:24:04,215 --> 01:24:06,092
It was so quiet...

1006
01:24:09,260 --> 01:24:10,386
...when she died.

1007
01:24:13,181 --> 01:24:16,976
Do you know,
I thought I wouldn't mind doing that myself..

1008
01:24:19,686 --> 01:24:22,938
I had a joke to tell her.

1009
01:24:25,523 --> 01:24:29,569
It wasn't a very good one
but she'd have laughed.

1010
01:24:31,070 --> 01:24:32,780
We need to believe in something divine.

1011
01:24:33,572 --> 01:24:34,823
Without the need for God.

1012
01:24:36,366 --> 01:24:38,951
Something we might call love...

1013
01:24:39,452 --> 01:24:40,453
...or goodness.

1014
01:24:41,912 --> 01:24:43,038
As the psalm says...

1015
01:24:44,289 --> 01:24:46,041
..."Whither shall I go from thy spirit...

1016
01:24:47,042 --> 01:24:48,752
...whither shall I flee from thy presence?

1017
01:24:50,504 --> 01:24:52,546
If I ascend unto Heaven thou art there...

1018
01:24:53,589 --> 01:24:56,341
...if I make my bed in Hell behold thou art there.

1019
01:24:58,050 --> 01:24:59,634
If I take the wings of the morning...

1020
01:25:00,093 --> 01:25:01,803
...and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea...

1021
01:25:03,346 --> 01:25:05,390
...even there shall thy hand lead me...

1022
01:25:06,516 --> 01:25:08,476
...and thy right hand shall hold me."
