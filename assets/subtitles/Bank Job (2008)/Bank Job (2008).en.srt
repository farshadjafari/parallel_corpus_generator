1
00:00:37,503 --> 00:00:39,528
# Well, you're dirty and sweet #

2
00:00:39,605 --> 00:00:43,473
# Clad in black, don't look back,
and I love you #

3
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:46,677
# You're dirty and sweet,
oh yeah #

4
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:50,983
# Well, you're slim and you're weak #

5
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,577
# You got the teeth
of the hydra upon you #

6
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:58,249
# You're dirty, sweet
and you're my girl #

7
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:03,490
# Get it on, bang a gong #

8
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,394
# Get it on #

9
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:10,803
# Get it on, bang a gong #

10
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,770
# Get it on #

11
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,944
# Well, you're built like a car #

12
00:01:21,013 --> 00:01:24,744
# You got a hubcap
diamond star halo #

13
00:01:24,817 --> 00:01:27,411
# You're built like a car, oh yeah #

14
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:32,151
# Well, you're an untamed youth #

15
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:35,956
# That's the truth,
with your cloak full of eagles #

16
00:01:36,028 --> 00:01:39,293
# You're dirty, sweet
and you're my girl #

17
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:43,068
# Get it on #

18
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:45,832
# Bang a gong, get it on #

19
00:01:48,674 --> 00:01:50,608
# Get it on #

20
00:01:50,676 --> 00:01:53,304
# Bang a gong, get it on. #

21
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,394
Another Terry Leather
low-mileage gem.

22
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,761
Got your glad rags sorted out
for your wedding tomorrow?

23
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:14,891
Yeah, course, Terry.
New suit...

24
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:16,764
two buttons,
nine-inch bum flaps.

25
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:19,134
Nice.
Ingrid will like that.

26
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,103
So you're getting
married tomorrow, Ingrid?

27
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:24,234
I hope so.

28
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,210
Go on. Get off home.
Go and make yourself

29
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:28,008
look more beautiful
than you already are.

30
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:30,973
If that's possible.

31
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:33,518
Terry.

32
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:36,054
Promise you won't get Eddie
too legless tonight, will ya?

33
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:38,056
- At his stag do.
- Just going round to pub.

34
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:39,614
Couple of pints and a sing-song.

35
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:58,233
Fucking what are you
trying to do to me, eh?

36
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:00,677
I've got Jessell's money!

37
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:03,806
The problem is
it's tied up in these cars

38
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:05,544
and you wankers want
to trash the lot of them.

39
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:08,086
Mr. Jessell doesn't care
about your inventory.

40
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:09,985
Mr. Jessell wants to know
when he's getting paid.

41
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:11,683
Any day, I swear, Perky.

42
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:15,994
- What did you call me?
- I called you Perky, Perky.

43
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:18,792
Everyone calls you Perky
and him Pinky.

44
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,856
- Pinky and Perky?
- Yeah.

45
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:22,628
They're fucking cartoon pigs
on the telly.

46
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,670
What, people call us that
behind our backs?

47
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,432
Well, they're not gonna
say it to your face, are they?

48
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:28,064
Well, you just bloody did.

49
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,238
Yeah, well, you got me rattled.

50
00:03:32,311 --> 00:03:33,835
You're very intimidating.

51
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:42,249
Don't make us come back again.

52
00:03:50,963 --> 00:03:53,124
Not every customer's
a satisfied customer.

53
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:56,964
What are you doing
around here, Martine?

54
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:58,663
- What are you doing tonight?
- Tonight?

55
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:02,300
Tonight Eddie's stag do.
I'm taking him out for a drink.

56
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,469
- Why?
- I've got a proposition for you, Terry.

57
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,172
A proposition?

58
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:09,407
Can you meet me at the Player's Club
before you see the boys?

59
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:11,746
And I'll fill you in on the details.

60
00:04:11,817 --> 00:04:13,284
Make it 9:00.

61
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,590
- Morning, Gale.
- Morning, Tim.

62
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:21,183
Top floor.

63
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,888
- Summoned by the gods?
- Something like that.

64
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:25,760
Get up to any mischief
this weekend?

65
00:04:25,831 --> 00:04:27,321
Don't know
what you're talking about.

66
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,265
I'm a married man.

67
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:33,337
What do you think,
am I presentable?

68
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:35,840
Not sure about the tie, darling.

69
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:37,375
Oh, what's this?

70
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,172
Peace and love?

71
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:41,270
Too much of that nonsense,
we'll both be out of a job.

72
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:46,184
Michael Abdul Malik.

73
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:48,982
Calls himself "Michael X"
in homage to Malcolm X,

74
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:50,818
his American counterpart.

75
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,687
The pinko press
would have us believe

76
00:04:52,758 --> 00:04:54,692
this... Michael X

77
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,228
is a crusading champion
of the poor and oppressed.

78
00:04:57,296 --> 00:04:59,924
And the black Robin Hood
of Notting Hill.

79
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:01,899
The richer, whiter
and more famous,

80
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,435
the more they fawn over him.

81
00:05:03,502 --> 00:05:05,231
The truth is,
he's a slum landlord,

82
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:06,771
a drug dealer
and a vicious pimp

83
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,431
who should have been
imprisoned years go.

84
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:12,038
Are you not charging
outrageous rent

85
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:15,103
to my brothers and sisters,
Mr. Brown?

86
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:18,275
I'm charging the same as your
slumlord friend, Lew Vogel.

87
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,512
10 quid a week is too much
for this shithole.

88
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:23,945
You know...

89
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:25,650
I always wanted to meet a white man

90
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:28,091
by the name of Brown.

91
00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:31,660
You know what this is?

92
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:34,063
It is a slave collar,
and the white man

93
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:35,862
made my mothers and fathers

94
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:37,960
wear this to bend them
to his will.

95
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,732
Can I bend you
to my will, Mr. Brown?

96
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,869
He's your faithful dog
now, Michael.

97
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:52,778
Michael, I don't think we should
get our hopes up here.

98
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,217
Kidnapping, extortion,

99
00:05:54,286 --> 00:05:55,878
assault on this man Brown here,

100
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:58,219
as well as your previous
problems with the law...

101
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:01,123
I mean, you could be looking
at 10 to 20 years for this.

102
00:06:02,194 --> 00:06:04,162
I don't think so.
I am smarter

103
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,061
and better protected
than whitey thinks.

104
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:07,759
All rise.

105
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:13,694
It seems Michael X has managed
to keep himself out of jail

106
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:16,401
by threatening to release
damning photographs

107
00:06:16,475 --> 00:06:19,342
of a certain royal personage.

108
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,017
Until we get our hands
on these snaps, the police can't move.

109
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:28,485
The public prosecutor
won't move

110
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,317
and the home office
doesn't want to know.

111
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:32,118
Has anyone actually
seen these photographs?

112
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,991
Yes. But at the moment
I'm not at the liberty

113
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,893
to say who
that person is.

114
00:06:37,963 --> 00:06:40,693
We've had Michael X under
surveillance for quite a while.

115
00:06:40,766 --> 00:06:43,360
He keeps a safe deposit box
at the Lloyds Bank in Marylebone.

116
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:45,927
We believe that's
where the photos are located.

117
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:50,104
Well, seems
straightforward enough.

118
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:52,007
I'll send a team into this bank

119
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,705
and take whatever he's got
in the safe deposit box.

120
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:56,407
That would have to be sanctioned
at the highest level.

121
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:59,610
- And that's not going to happen.
- Ah.

122
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:01,778
Do you see our problem?

123
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:04,288
There can be
no connection to 506.

124
00:07:04,356 --> 00:07:06,517
So you want me
to come up with something

125
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,651
that avoids any
accountability for anyone.

126
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:10,923
We'd welcome suggestions, Tim.

127
00:07:10,996 --> 00:07:13,396
And if it all goes pear-shaped,

128
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:15,093
I assume it's my ass on the line.

129
00:07:15,167 --> 00:07:16,759
You're young and ambitious, Tim.

130
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:19,862
Chance to make
a name for yourself.

131
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,406
Thank you, sir.

132
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:25,338
Passengers arriving on flight 47...

133
00:07:28,547 --> 00:07:30,811
Excuse me there, miss.
Can I have a word?

134
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:32,748
Yes.

135
00:07:32,818 --> 00:07:35,218
- Where have you been?
- Morocco.

136
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:40,150
I'll have to check
your underwear.

137
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:41,818
Be my guest.

138
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,920
- We found what we were looking for.
- Found what?

139
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:46,988
What were you looking for?

140
00:07:49,568 --> 00:07:51,900
Oh, Tim, thank God.

141
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,495
I'm in a spot of bother.

142
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:57,765
- What have you been up to?
- Nothing much. You?

143
00:07:57,843 --> 00:07:59,743
I was in Morocco recently.

144
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:02,778
- Business or pleasure?
- Bit of both.

145
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,543
Drinks are on me.

146
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,522
So are we gonna sit here all night
making small talk?

147
00:08:13,058 --> 00:08:14,582
I know you, Terry.

148
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,855
And I know your mates.

149
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:18,988
You've always been looking
for the big score,

150
00:08:19,064 --> 00:08:21,123
the one that makes
sense of everything.

151
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:24,993
I have it for you.

152
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,698
- What?
- A bank.

153
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,705
A bank? As in rob?

154
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,041
How would you know
about a bank?

155
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:38,481
I've been seeing this guy,
runs his own business...

156
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:40,985
security systems.

157
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:44,614
Next month, they're installing
new alarms at a bank in Marylebone.

158
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,124
Seems like the trains have been
setting off the trembler alarms

159
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,252
in the vault
and they've had to turn them off.

160
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:52,195
So for a week or so,
they won't have any.

161
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:56,158
Now why would he tell you all this?

162
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:59,101
We were having a laugh about it.

163
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:02,902
"Imagine if half the villains in London
knew about this," he said.

164
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,842
And I thought, "I know
half the villains in London.

165
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:07,970
I grew up with some of them."

166
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,072
Look, me and my mates
might have been involved

167
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,208
with the odd bit of skullduggery,

168
00:09:12,284 --> 00:09:15,412
but can you see us tooled up
taking on a bank like the James gang?

169
00:09:15,487 --> 00:09:18,251
No, this isn't about waving
a water pistol at a cashier's head.

170
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:21,851
This is about getting into the basement
where the deposit boxes are...

171
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:24,088
hidden, secret wealth.

172
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:26,188
Money and jewels
that are safe to steal

173
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:27,755
'cause people won't report it.

174
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:31,360
Hold on, hold on.
We can't talk about this here.

175
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:34,099
It's a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity, Terry.

176
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:35,572
We can't pass it up.

177
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,138
I didn't expect this
from you tonight, Martine.

178
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:43,443
What did you expect?

179
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,517
I'll have to think about it.

180
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:56,521
Better get off to your stag party.

181
00:09:56,595 --> 00:09:58,324
Thanks for the drink.

182
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:04,696
Eddie tells me his brother
invited you to the wedding.

183
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:07,596
- Are you going?
- I'll see you there.

184
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,409
- Can I get a Campari and soda, no ice?
- Yes, sir.

185
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,992
Thank you. Well, Tim sweetie,
what do you think?

186
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:31,586
Is he up for it?

187
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,359
Maybe.

188
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:35,024
Cheers, gorgeous.

189
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:58,516
- So, are you coming in?
- I don't know, it's late.

190
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:02,026
Do you need to run home
like a good little boy?

191
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:03,618
I guess I've got time.

192
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:21,474
What exactly do you do?

193
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:24,443
Bit of this, bit of that.

194
00:11:24,516 --> 00:11:26,143
How did you and Hakim meet?

195
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:28,982
I met Hakim in Los Angeles last spring.

196
00:11:29,054 --> 00:11:31,215
He was raising money
for a black Montessori school

197
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,848
and writing his life story.

198
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:35,951
And what an extraordinary
life it has been.

199
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:39,725
The book is called "From the Dead Level:
Malcolm X and Me."

200
00:11:39,798 --> 00:11:42,562
I've read the manuscript.
Hakim is a poet,

201
00:11:42,634 --> 00:11:44,261
the voice of the black soul.

202
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:46,804
Our friend is throwing a thing
next week to celebrate

203
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,362
the launch of brother Hakim's book.

204
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,601
And you are all invited.

205
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:53,270
Hakim, tell us more
about your book.

206
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,714
It's about being born
black in America.

207
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:01,947
Can any of you imagine what it is like
to be born a black man in this world?

208
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:07,918
Can any of you white women
imagine what it would be like

209
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:09,927
to bring a black baby
into this world?

210
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,216
Evening, sir.

211
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:46,690
Go on! Come on!

212
00:12:49,968 --> 00:12:51,435
Yeah!

213
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:53,631
What are you thinking?

214
00:12:53,705 --> 00:12:55,696
Why are we even
having this conversation?

215
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:56,934
We're not...

216
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:58,704
Here's your beer.

217
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:03,674
We are not bank robbers.

218
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:06,081
Maybe that's why we could
get away with it.

219
00:13:06,151 --> 00:13:08,381
It's a bit daunting, isn't it?

220
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,944
Do you know
what scares me more?

221
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:11,956
Living and dying
with nothing to show for it.

222
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,421
Do you know how old Mozart was
when he composed his first minuet?

223
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:17,962
- No.
- Five.

224
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,657
Five... a fucking minuet.

225
00:13:19,731 --> 00:13:21,699
And how would
you know that fact, Terry?

226
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:25,203
Because it's tattooed
on that stripper's ass, Kevin.

227
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,067
What the fuck's it matter how I know?

228
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,437
It's a fact and you're
missing the point, Kev.

229
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:31,772
What I'm trying to say is,
it's time we stop fucking about

230
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:33,744
and stop picking the shit
from under our fingernails.

231
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:36,110
Shtum, lads.
Coppers at 12:00.

232
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:53,895
Oh, what are you two
doing here personally?

233
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:56,935
I thought you were way past
being your own bagman, Gerry.

234
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,698
Your associate, Sonia Bern,
has raised prices

235
00:13:59,771 --> 00:14:01,568
at that knocking shop of hers.

236
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,165
- 120 quid, up from 100.
- And your point?

237
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:07,144
A rising tide lifts all ships, mate.

238
00:14:07,212 --> 00:14:10,010
I think we're owed some money.

239
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:12,676
- 'Cause even Sonia's can be raided.
- Yeah, you'd do that, wouldn't you?

240
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:14,412
You'd kill the goose
that lays your golden egg.

241
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:16,147
Well, that would be dumb,
wouldn't it?

242
00:14:16,221 --> 00:14:18,781
But then again, everyone knows
coppers are dumb.

243
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:22,318
Well, you can do
one thing for me.

244
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,497
You can stop your colleagues

245
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:28,897
from having their
boys' night out in my clubs.

246
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:35,102
They're loud, they're lewd

247
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:37,039
and they expect free oral sex.

248
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:39,009
Do you know what?
That's disgusting.

249
00:14:39,077 --> 00:14:41,068
I mean, most of them
have families.

250
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:45,013
We'll pass the word along.

251
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:00,931
Lew, you tell your
greedy little bobbies

252
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:02,762
to go and find
their perks elsewhere.

253
00:15:02,834 --> 00:15:04,426
No one's gonna bother me.

254
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:08,098
My patrons could have a lot of these
bent coppers put out to pasture.

255
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:10,198
Well, I say spread the wealth around
and keep the peace.

256
00:15:10,275 --> 00:15:12,573
Five quid a week extra.

257
00:15:12,644 --> 00:15:14,669
That's all it's worth.

258
00:15:14,746 --> 00:15:16,509
I'll pass it on.

259
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:29,760
Drysdale.

260
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:31,261
Urquhart.

261
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:34,999
Lord Drysdale,

262
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:37,797
can I offer you a drink
before your session?

263
00:15:37,869 --> 00:15:39,359
Very kind of you, Sonia.

264
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,307
Good to see you.

265
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,070
As well, Urquhart, as well.

266
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:54,152
Good girl.

267
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,252
Tighter! Yes.

268
00:15:58,323 --> 00:15:59,813
That's a good girl.

269
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,157
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

270
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:04,855
You have been
a very naughty boy.

271
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,243
Louder. Louder!

272
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:39,927
- I can't.
- Come on.

273
00:16:39,998 --> 00:16:41,625
Give him a snog, Ingrid!

274
00:16:50,575 --> 00:16:52,065
Come on.

275
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:53,941
Nice work, Eddie!
Nice work.

276
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,949
- Hello.
- Saw you in a magazine the other day...

277
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:04,852
Campari ad on the beach.

278
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:06,686
- Nice.
- Must have been an old one.

279
00:17:06,758 --> 00:17:08,885
- I'm not modeling anymore.
- I don't know why.

280
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:12,858
- Still a knockout.
- What are you doing these days, Dave?

281
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:16,162
Me? Bit of film work.

282
00:17:16,234 --> 00:17:17,963
- Extra, you know.
- And you, Kevin?

283
00:17:18,036 --> 00:17:19,697
You're still snapping, I see.

284
00:17:19,771 --> 00:17:22,001
The wedding photos... no no.
It's just a favor for the family.

285
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:24,508
Fashion's my game,
fashion and passports.

286
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,601
And the odd snap
of a wayward husband.

287
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:29,647
- Thank you, Dave.
- So what's the verdict, boys?

288
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:32,376
We're interested.

289
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:34,248
First thing we should do
is take a look at the place,

290
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,617
suss it out,
maybe open a box of our own.

291
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:39,282
I've already done that.
We can go and have a look tomorrow.

292
00:17:41,259 --> 00:17:43,193
Tomorrow it is.

293
00:17:43,261 --> 00:17:45,923
- Heads up, lads.
- All right?

294
00:17:45,997 --> 00:17:48,989
- She's adorable, your little one.
- She's off.

295
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:51,433
What a gorgeous flower girl
your eldest made.

296
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:54,563
- Thanks, Catherine.
- I do envy you.

297
00:17:55,907 --> 00:17:58,000
- Kev, want to dance?
- Yeah, come on.

298
00:17:58,076 --> 00:17:59,600
It was lovely to see you all. Ciao.

299
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:01,669
- Ciao.
- All right, Wen?

300
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,214
All right.

301
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:06,150
She envies me.

302
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,686
She being sarcastic?

303
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,188
I suppose what she meant was
money can't buy what we have.

304
00:18:12,557 --> 00:18:14,787
Didn't you used to go out with her?

305
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,953
No, love,
that was Kevin.

306
00:18:17,028 --> 00:18:18,996
He had this big thing for her.

307
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:22,056
- And you didn't?
- No.

308
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:24,998
Not like me and you...
love at first sight.

309
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,061
Oh yeah.

310
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:30,404
I remember that night. You was
with your mate Audrey at that disco.

311
00:18:30,475 --> 00:18:34,241
Saw this gorgeous little bum
in a pencil skirt.

312
00:18:34,312 --> 00:18:36,803
I thought, "I've got to have that."

313
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:39,476
But Audrey, she already had a bloke,
so I pulled you.

314
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:41,712
- Cheeky sod.
- Daddy!

315
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,482
Daddy, come and dance with me.

316
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,182
Come on, Dad!

317
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:05,171
- I'll just shoot it.
- Piss off, Kevin.

318
00:19:30,268 --> 00:19:32,361
Good morning.
I'd like to access

319
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:34,337
my safe deposit box, please.

320
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:36,431
Martine Love.
L-O-V-E.

321
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,203
Certainly, madam.

322
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,409
Taxi!

323
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,288
- You're an actor, right?
- That's right.

324
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:59,262
I did a couple of films
for you, Mr. Vogel.

325
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:01,899
Yeah, right.

326
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:03,730
Where to, guv?

327
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:08,196
So what were these
films you were in?

328
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:10,605
- Forget about it.
- Go on.

329
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,742
Technically, it's what you call...

330
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:16,508
pornography.

331
00:20:16,581 --> 00:20:19,015
- You're joking.
- No.

332
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:21,484
So you've been going round town
with a 12-inch mutton dagger

333
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,214
hanging down your pants?

334
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:24,778
That's nothing to be ashamed of.

335
00:20:59,624 --> 00:21:01,455
Nice.

336
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:05,087
Fake. Got a posh party
at the weekend.

337
00:21:20,111 --> 00:21:22,102
This is the one.
The lease is available.

338
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:33,982
Finally.

339
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,027
- How do I look? Good?
- Not your best, Dave.

340
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:40,262
Here we go.

341
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:42,800
So how come you got the inside dope
on this place, Martine?

342
00:21:42,867 --> 00:21:45,392
She knows this bloke...
runs a security company.

343
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,836
Bloke? Is it serious?
Are you getting married?

344
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:49,703
He is married.
All the better ones are.

345
00:21:52,243 --> 00:21:54,143
Here we go.
Marylebone Road and Baker Street.

346
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:56,146
On the corner here's the bank,

347
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:59,547
next door is the Chicken Inn
and at 189... Le Sac.

348
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,142
In the back here
is an underground car park

349
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:03,551
with direct access
to the shops' basements.

350
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:06,489
We can pull in here
from Glentworth Street

351
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:08,082
into the car park
for drop-offs and pick-ups

352
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:09,888
without being seen
from the street.

353
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:12,122
We'll dig a tunnel
from the basement of the shop

354
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:15,758
under the Chicken Inn and pop up
in the safe deposit vault.

355
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,495
I got a question.

356
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:19,230
What do us lot know
about digging tunnels?

357
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:22,671
Nothing.
But I know a man who does.

358
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:24,436
So what do you reckon, Bambas?

359
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,534
What do I reckon?

360
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,511
I reckon I know you guys.

361
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,810
But I don't know her.

362
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:32,577
Don't worry about Martine,
she's solid.

363
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:34,141
We go way back.

364
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:36,744
Terry, you have been
up to some mischief in your time.

365
00:22:36,821 --> 00:22:39,051
But this... this is
serious shit, my friend.

366
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:41,388
Don't you think it's a little
out of your league?

367
00:22:41,459 --> 00:22:43,427
Maybe it's time we stepped
up to the first division.

368
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:51,668
There's going to be reinforced
concrete under the vault.

369
00:22:51,736 --> 00:22:53,897
You're going to need
a thermic lance, a jackhammer,

370
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:57,032
a generator, lights,
ropes, cables, the works.

371
00:22:57,108 --> 00:22:59,576
About 40 feet of digging
before we're under the bank.

372
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:02,135
Hey, we could hire some micks
from Camden Town to do the digging.

373
00:23:02,213 --> 00:23:03,874
That's brilliant, Dave.
Why don't we just

374
00:23:03,948 --> 00:23:06,416
pay their National Insurance
contributions?

375
00:23:06,484 --> 00:23:08,884
And then you won't have to get dirt
on your Tommy Nutter suit.

376
00:23:08,953 --> 00:23:11,012
This way, Michael.
One more shot. This way.

377
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:13,881
Thank you, that's great.

378
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:19,119
- What are your plans?
- I am returning to Trinidad

379
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:21,631
to liberate my brothers and sisters

380
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,136
from the enslavement
of the British colonialists.

381
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:27,034
What about the charges
you are facing?

382
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:29,596
- How can you leave England?
- They are liars and cowards.

383
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:33,166
If they had anything against me
but their fear of me,

384
00:23:33,244 --> 00:23:35,474
I'd be tried and jailed.

385
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:38,607
- See you later, Bambo.
- We're gonna need a front-man on this,

386
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:41,743
someone who can sign the lease
on the shop and look the business.

387
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,549
I know someone... Guy Singer.

388
00:23:43,621 --> 00:23:46,089
Calls himself "the Major."
It's a load of bollocks,

389
00:23:46,157 --> 00:23:48,455
but he's got this right posh accent

390
00:23:48,526 --> 00:23:50,426
if anyone comes nosing about.

391
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:55,524
A bit tight under the arms,
don't you think?

392
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,693
Traditional fit, sir.

393
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,498
If one can't raise
one's hands above one's head

394
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:02,199
it tends to inhibit
any impulsive acts of surrender.

395
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,476
I'll be right back, sir.

396
00:24:08,546 --> 00:24:11,106
What on earth
are you doing here?

397
00:24:11,182 --> 00:24:12,809
Got a bit of business
for you, Guy.

398
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:14,351
You might be tempted.

399
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:24,287
Sit down, love.

400
00:24:25,563 --> 00:24:26,928
What do you think you're doing?

401
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:30,159
Taking the E for a test drive.

402
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:31,793
Tell your boss he can
have his inventory back

403
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,599
when he settles
Mr. Jessell's debt.

404
00:24:33,671 --> 00:24:35,161
And it'd better be soon

405
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,071
or we'll be back
to tap Terry's kneecaps.

406
00:24:41,312 --> 00:24:43,337
If I was you two,
I'd be looking for another job.

407
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,915
- Lovely. Cheers.
- Cheers.

408
00:24:56,694 --> 00:24:58,662
So, come on then,
what don't I know?

409
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,527
Romantic dinner
on a Monday night?

410
00:25:05,703 --> 00:25:07,193
Look, honey...

411
00:25:09,073 --> 00:25:11,064
I'm gonna be working
some strange hours

412
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:12,871
over the next week or two.

413
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:15,572
Don't ask me what I'm doing
because I don't want to lie to you.

414
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:18,974
What are you doing?

415
00:25:21,719 --> 00:25:23,983
Look, I know I've
caused us a few problems,

416
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:26,990
but those cars aren't selling.

417
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:29,424
All I was trying to do
is get out of the game.

418
00:25:31,729 --> 00:25:33,856
- This thing's gonna put us there.
- Will it?

419
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:35,661
Yeah.

420
00:25:35,733 --> 00:25:37,928
In a better place.

421
00:25:38,002 --> 00:25:40,493
It's for all of us...

422
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:43,673
for you and the kids.

423
00:25:43,741 --> 00:25:46,209
And how afraid do
I have to be, Terry?

424
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:55,183
Maybe it'd be a smart thing
if you went and stayed with your aunt...

425
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:59,022
in case things turn to custard.

426
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:11,358
So we are settled...
25% to run my girls

427
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:13,461
till I return from Trinidad.

428
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:15,472
It's all right,
you don't have to worry.

429
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:20,106
I'll look after your little flock
of birds like they were my own.

430
00:26:20,178 --> 00:26:23,147
So long as you remember
they are not your own.

431
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:26,012
Lew, while I'm back in Trinidad,
I can arrange for a shipment

432
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,551
of some high-grade ganja.

433
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:30,588
Not interested.
You want my opinion?

434
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:33,089
I think drugs are responsible
for the moral decay

435
00:26:33,157 --> 00:26:34,920
of this country's young.

436
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:37,154
No, smut smut and more smut...

437
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:39,321
that's my special area of interest.

438
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:40,625
You should think about it.

439
00:26:40,698 --> 00:26:42,290
With these goodies you could make
a lot of dough,

440
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:44,062
especially with the police
in your pocket.

441
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:45,966
No, I'm paying enough bung as it is,

442
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:48,665
but probably not as much
as you're donating

443
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,605
to be permitted
to leave our fair shores.

444
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:53,337
Not a shilling.
I have something so special,

445
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:54,969
I don't need to pay anyone.

446
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:56,911
And what would that be, Michael?

447
00:26:56,981 --> 00:26:59,506
Sorry, Lew.

448
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:01,779
Well...

449
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:04,344
whatever it is, you crafty bugger,
I hope you're keeping it safe.

450
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:06,856
Yes, as safe as it can be in the place
that you recommended.

451
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,953
- You're late.
- Sorry.

452
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:16,798
This is the Major...
Major Guy Singer,

453
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:18,358
the final member of our team.

454
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:20,370
I don't know this man.

455
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:22,065
- Who are you?
- None of your business.

456
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,802
No secrets around here.
The Major's a con artist.

457
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:26,969
Usually elderly widows.

458
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:29,036
There's no need
to bring that up.

459
00:27:29,113 --> 00:27:31,138
Now he's the official
new owner of Le Sac.

460
00:27:31,215 --> 00:27:33,979
Handbags and leather accessories
for the discerning lady.

461
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:35,349
Nice.

462
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,412
I told the district planner's office
about the remodeling.

463
00:27:38,489 --> 00:27:40,616
They gave me the specs
for the sewage, drainage,

464
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:42,455
gas and power lines.

465
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:44,552
We'll have to go deep
to miss that lot.

466
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:48,990
- What's this for?
- That is the thermic lance.

467
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:51,001
It cuts through
concrete and metal.

468
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:53,731
We're doing this, eh?

469
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:55,830
I mean,
we're bloody going for it.

470
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:58,102
- Let's see what this thing can do.
- Good idea, Kev.

471
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,643
Give us a demonstration,
Bambo.

472
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:01,576
Okay, hold this.
Hold it. Here.

473
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:04,376
Kevin, go stand
over there by the oxygen.

474
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:06,417
Here we go.

475
00:28:21,899 --> 00:28:24,459
- Turn it off!
- Off off off off!

476
00:28:24,535 --> 00:28:27,299
- Right off!
- Loco!

477
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,397
They know what they're doing,
these people, do they?

478
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:32,170
Oh, absolutely.
Professional criminals.

479
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:34,473
What's the worst-case scenario?

480
00:28:34,545 --> 00:28:37,139
They get caught and go to jail.
No possible connection to us.

481
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:39,274
What about this model
you're screwing?

482
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,511
What promises have you made
to keep her in line?

483
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:43,383
None that can't be broken.

484
00:28:43,454 --> 00:28:45,752
Look, she's our only tie
to the bank operation.

485
00:28:45,823 --> 00:28:48,121
If things do go belly-up,
it'll only take one cut

486
00:28:48,192 --> 00:28:50,217
to sever the knot.

487
00:28:50,294 --> 00:28:51,454
What's Gale Benson up to?

488
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:55,260
I believe she's working her way
into Michael X's inner sanctum.

489
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:56,630
Could you sign my book please?

490
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,894
Daddy!

491
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,170
I am so glad you decided to come.

492
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:09,239
This is my father,
Sir Leonard Plugge.

493
00:29:09,313 --> 00:29:11,110
Always happy to meet
Gale's new friends.

494
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:12,740
Her new name is Hale Kimga.

495
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:17,083
It's an anagram of the letters
of our names... Hakim and Gale.

496
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:20,249
- And your name is?
- Hakim.

497
00:29:20,324 --> 00:29:22,485
- Hakim Jamal.
- Right.

498
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,995
Excuse me.

499
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,793
Hello, gorgeous.

500
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,804
So, where's the author?

501
00:29:34,872 --> 00:29:37,067
He's over there
signing his masterpiece.

502
00:29:37,141 --> 00:29:39,166
Why don't you both drop
by the house this weekend

503
00:29:39,243 --> 00:29:41,302
and introduce Mr. Jamal to mother?

504
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:43,176
Sorry, Daddy, can't do that.

505
00:29:43,247 --> 00:29:45,545
We're popping on down
to the islands for a while.

506
00:29:45,616 --> 00:29:47,243
Let me get you a drink.

507
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:49,183
Good luck with your book.

508
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,358
So have you read
this book of his?

509
00:29:55,426 --> 00:29:57,621
- You must be joking.
- Right.

510
00:29:57,695 --> 00:29:59,686
You're probably undercover

511
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:03,222
spying on black power's insidious threat
to the British way of life.

512
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,928
That's very funny.

513
00:30:05,002 --> 00:30:07,493
Tell me, is our little enterprise
still shipshape?

514
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:09,369
We're currently on schedule, Tim.

515
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,238
We're taking over the shop
on Friday afternoon.

516
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,768
I know if this stuffs up,
I'm in poo-poo land.

517
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,711
We have a blue transit van
just pulled up,

518
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:25,085
"Clacy Builders" on the side.

519
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:28,191
And we have one man
entering the shop.

520
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:41,969
Construction crew for Le Sac.

521
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:58,711
I've got a question.

522
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:01,251
What do we do with all the dirt
we're gonna dig out the hole?

523
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:02,877
It's all been worked out, Dave.

524
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:05,684
We'll dig another hole in that corner
over there and put it in that.

525
00:32:05,756 --> 00:32:07,223
Over.

526
00:32:08,292 --> 00:32:10,590
If we're to get the job done before
the bank opens on Monday morning,

527
00:32:10,661 --> 00:32:13,892
- we'd better get a wriggle on.
- Want to do the honors, Martine?

528
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:15,626
This is it.
Here we go.

529
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:20,530
Watch your nails, Martine.

530
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,869
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

531
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,101
Let's get this show on the road.

532
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:47,831
Some racket there, Alf.

533
00:32:47,898 --> 00:32:49,763
Bloody hell!
What's going on?

534
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:05,909
Kev!

535
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:09,947
Dave, come on, mate.

536
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:19,422
Dave, you need a break.

537
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,863
- I'll take over.
- Cheers, Major.

538
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:25,869
Heads up!

539
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:34,538
Where's Dave?

540
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:36,477
No idea.

541
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:43,152
- Where'd you get to?
- Just checking the door was locked.

542
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,847
Of course it's locked, Dave.

543
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:47,516
I locked it.

544
00:33:52,396 --> 00:33:53,954
Hang on.
What have we got here?

545
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:58,101
What does this copper want?

546
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:00,399
Christ, he's not
going in there, is he?

547
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,531
- I'll go.
- Shit! Dave, get back here.

548
00:34:05,609 --> 00:34:08,237
Stop! Hold it down!
Someone's knocking.

549
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:10,371
Stop! There's somebody
at the door of the shop!

550
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:12,211
- There's somebody...
- Bambas!

551
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:15,848
Bambas!
Hold on.

552
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:18,922
There's somebody at the door.

553
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,560
- I don't mind going.
- It's my job.

554
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:36,195
- Coppers.
- It's the Old Bill!

555
00:34:45,549 --> 00:34:48,245
Good evening.
You're working late.

556
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:50,378
Around the clock, Officer.

557
00:34:50,454 --> 00:34:53,287
Expanding our storage, trying
to complete renovations for the grand...

558
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:54,824
If you don't mind, sir.

559
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,062
Excuse me!

560
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,499
You using a jackhammer
down there?

561
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:06,292
Yeah, you had
some complaints, Officer?

562
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,962
Yeah, from some
of your neighbors.

563
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,072
We'll try to keep it down, all right?

564
00:35:14,678 --> 00:35:16,908
Right.

565
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:22,744
I wonder how they talked
their way out of that one.

566
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:25,914
Tim, Quinn here.

567
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:28,356
Yeah, we just had a copper
go into the shop.

568
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:30,860
We're not sure why.
He's gone now.

569
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:35,725
All clear.

570
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,667
We need a lookout,
someone on a roof somewhere.

571
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:40,863
- We've got the walkie-talkies.
- What about Eddie?

572
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:42,997
He's a good lad,
we can trust him.

573
00:35:43,073 --> 00:35:44,370
No, look, we're not
cutting anyone else in.

574
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:47,434
We won't cut him in on the loot.
Give him the car lot.

575
00:35:47,511 --> 00:35:50,207
Hopefully I won't need
that headache anymore.

576
00:35:51,715 --> 00:35:53,740
- My God, not again.
- Get up there, Major.

577
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,376
Cover that up!

578
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:03,387
It's not the coppers.

579
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:13,330
- Yes, can I help you?
- Delivery for Dave Shilling.

580
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:14,837
- What is it?
- Chicken and chips.

581
00:36:16,373 --> 00:36:17,863
I see.

582
00:36:24,648 --> 00:36:27,014
- Takeaway for Mr. Shilling.
- Thanks.

583
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:30,211
You can't be serious?

584
00:36:30,287 --> 00:36:32,084
I was starving.

585
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:35,020
Mind the gap.

586
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:47,534
Radio's in the bag,
binocs as well.

587
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:49,971
There's a bed-sit
on the top floor of this building

588
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,203
paid for the week.
The ladder will get you to the roof.

589
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:55,472
You're in from Liverpool
looking for work.

590
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,036
I don't have a Liverpool accent.

591
00:36:57,114 --> 00:36:58,706
Then don't talk to anyone, Eddie.

592
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:43,726
I'm up on the roof and...

593
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:46,763
I got a good view
in all directions, over.

594
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:48,764
Are you in position, Nightjar?

595
00:37:48,832 --> 00:37:50,493
Command HQ, here.
Acknowledge.

596
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:53,059
Yeah, I'm in position.

597
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:55,867
I can see the front of the bank...
Marylebone Road,

598
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,841
Baker Street.
I can see everything really well.

599
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:02,345
All clear on
the western front, Guy. Over.

600
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:04,938
- No names, Eddie.
- Sorry, Dave.

601
00:38:06,483 --> 00:38:08,815
Hey, you delinquents,
what have I told you?

602
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:10,751
No idle chitchat.

603
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:12,789
Sorry... over.

604
00:38:12,856 --> 00:38:14,323
Fucking hell.

605
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:22,093
Wakey wakey, gentlemen.

606
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:23,793
I'll keep an eye
on the shop from here on.

607
00:38:23,867 --> 00:38:25,562
You two go around
to Glentworth Street,

608
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,263
cover the parking garage exit.

609
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:29,203
Okay.

610
00:38:47,791 --> 00:38:51,192
Nightjar, here. There's some
fella looking through the window.

611
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,764
Oh, hang on.

612
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,298
Wait, hang on, he's going.
He's going.

613
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:01,235
Yeah, he's gone. Over.

614
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:05,666
Roger, Nightjar.
Over and out.

615
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:09,542
I'm gonna go to the pub,
grab some more smokes.

616
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:11,137
Do you want anything?

617
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:13,843
Ooh, packet of Seniors.

618
00:39:13,917 --> 00:39:15,646
There you go, sir.

619
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:19,081
Two packets of Rothmans,
two Senior Service

620
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:21,386
- and eight bags of crisps.
- Okay.

621
00:39:21,458 --> 00:39:24,791
Hello, gorgeous.
We still on track?

622
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:27,490
We had a scare last night.
The cops came around.

623
00:39:27,564 --> 00:39:29,725
Can't you pull rank and make sure
it doesn't happen again?

624
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,236
No. We can't show our hand.
We're invisible, remember?

625
00:39:33,303 --> 00:39:35,794
- Wish I was.
- What about your friend, Terry?

626
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:38,398
Where's he planning
to carve up the proceeds?

627
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,806
Shit.

628
00:39:44,581 --> 00:39:47,311
- Pint here, chief.
- What's wrong?

629
00:39:47,384 --> 00:39:50,046
I had to take a break.

630
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,315
Who's that you was talking to?

631
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:54,880
I wasn't.
He was trying to chat me up.

632
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,718
It does happen you know.

633
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,031
- Right.
- There you are, love.

634
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:02,929
- Cheers. Keep the change.
- Thank you.

635
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,730
Anyway, what you doing here?
You following me?

636
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:09,435
No.

637
00:40:09,506 --> 00:40:10,939
Just wanted a pint.

638
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,568
Then enjoy it.

639
00:40:42,906 --> 00:40:44,601
- Hello, Gale.
- Where have you been?

640
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:47,439
You're rather impressed
with our friend Hakim, aren't you?

641
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:49,502
I know.
Rule number one...

642
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,741
don't get emotionally involved.

643
00:40:51,815 --> 00:40:53,407
Doesn't mean
I can't enjoy my work.

644
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:56,247
You certainly do.

645
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:00,784
What's your father think of your
consorting with these radicals anyway?

646
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:02,792
We are not amused.

647
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,055
Of course, if he knew
what I was really up to,

648
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,824
- he'd have a heart attack.
- Yeah.

649
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:11,527
Here you are.
Credit cards and cash.

650
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:14,264
If he does have copies of the photos
and negatives there, they'll be hidden.

651
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:17,671
Find them, destroy them
and then get out.

652
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:20,574
Michael X thinks he's safe
tucked away in Trinidad.

653
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:23,636
That'll all change
if we're successful here.

654
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:25,944
Just remember, Gale,
he's a nasty piece of work.

655
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,041
He's a crazy, dope-smoking,

656
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:31,178
lunatic, pimp extortionist
is what he is.

657
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:36,257
Everything okay, Nightjar?
Anything I need to know?

658
00:41:36,326 --> 00:41:38,726
Yeah, everything's
all right, mate.

659
00:41:39,963 --> 00:41:42,295
Listen, what if I want
to go for a pee up here?

660
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:44,391
I don't know,
use your imagination.

661
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:47,936
Stay off the radio unless
you see any Old Bill, all right?

662
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:51,841
Yeah, all right. If I see the Old Bill,
I'll let you know.

663
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:54,309
I'll speak to you in a bit.

664
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:56,107
Over.

665
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:04,319
Hey, Bambas!

666
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:06,356
What's all this brickwork?

667
00:42:06,423 --> 00:42:08,653
I don't know,
it wasn't on the plans.

668
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:15,094
- Terry!
- Fucking hell!

669
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:17,395
Terry! Bambas!

670
00:42:17,467 --> 00:42:19,059
Terry, talk to me!

671
00:42:21,371 --> 00:42:23,362
Tell!

672
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,101
Fuck.

673
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:27,200
Terry! Talk to me!

674
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,743
- You all right?
- I think so, yeah.

675
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:35,748
What happened?

676
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:38,083
The floor just caved in.

677
00:42:38,155 --> 00:42:39,952
Bloody hell, Terry,
don't do that to me.

678
00:42:40,023 --> 00:42:41,820
I thought you was a goner.

679
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,587
Give us a light, Dave.

680
00:42:45,662 --> 00:42:47,152
What's down there?

681
00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:50,489
It's a pile of skeletons.

682
00:42:50,567 --> 00:42:53,331
You're joking.
Let's hope they're not the last gang

683
00:42:53,403 --> 00:42:54,961
who tried to take this bank.

684
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:03,778
Latin, roughly translated...

685
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:05,712
"Lamb of God,
forgive us our sins."

686
00:43:05,782 --> 00:43:07,545
How do you know Latin?

687
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:09,108
Catholic school.

688
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:11,518
The Bleeding Heart Sisters
of Eternal Misery.

689
00:43:11,588 --> 00:43:13,556
Interesting date, 1665.

690
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:15,387
You know what year
that was, don't you?

691
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:17,654
The last time
West Ham won the Cup.

692
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:19,889
It was the Great Plague
of London.

693
00:43:19,963 --> 00:43:22,488
This must be a burial chamber,

694
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:24,227
the crypt where
they dumped the bodies.

695
00:43:24,301 --> 00:43:26,565
What, all these poor bastards
had the plague?

696
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:28,264
It could be infectious.

697
00:43:28,338 --> 00:43:29,930
I don't think so, Dave.

698
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:32,339
This crypt goes
all the way under the bank.

699
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:35,173
- It could put us in the vault quicker.
- Well, how are we gonna do that?

700
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,731
Concrete.

701
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,426
Floor of the vault.

702
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:01,030
- Time to get paid for all our work.
- Right.

703
00:44:01,104 --> 00:44:04,130
If we hit the restaurant by mistake,
we'll be knee-deep in fried chicken.

704
00:44:05,208 --> 00:44:06,903
I'll be happy if
we don't hit the sewage.

705
00:44:56,259 --> 00:44:59,057
When are you guys gonna hit the vault?
I'm freezing my tits off up here.

706
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:00,756
Over.

707
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:02,696
In the army, soldiers would
pull on their puds

708
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:05,064
to keep their blood flowing.
Over.

709
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:08,036
What regiment were you in,
the Royal Corps of Wankers?

710
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:12,041
- Over.
- Yes. We welcome new members.

711
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:14,703
Roger. Over and out.

712
00:45:14,778 --> 00:45:16,973
Emergency operator,
which service do you require?

713
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,537
The police, please.

714
00:45:18,615 --> 00:45:20,515
Putting you through.

715
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:22,415
- Police here, can I help you?
- Yes.

716
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:23,976
I'm a ham radio operator

717
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:26,386
and I think I may be overhearing
a robbery in progress.

718
00:45:40,737 --> 00:45:43,706
We're in.
Dave, get the ladder.

719
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:22,844
We'll make the move
into the vault after we take a break.

720
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:25,040
Need to let the fumes clear out.

721
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:27,140
You're having a laugh, isn't you?
Let's go in now.

722
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:29,549
Dave, nothing's going nowhere.

723
00:46:29,619 --> 00:46:32,053
You can hardly
breathe in there.

724
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:34,454
Nightjar, are you there? Over.

725
00:46:34,524 --> 00:46:36,549
Nightjar here. Over.

726
00:46:36,626 --> 00:46:38,116
We're in. Over.

727
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:42,196
- What, in the actual vault?
- Yes, in the actual vault. Over.

728
00:46:42,265 --> 00:46:44,790
Great. Great.
That's great news. Over.

729
00:46:46,236 --> 00:46:48,295
We're taking a break.
We're knackered.

730
00:46:48,371 --> 00:46:50,532
We need to get some sleep,
get a bit of shuteye

731
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:52,370
while the fumes clear out.
Over.

732
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:53,568
Oh, lucky you.

733
00:46:53,643 --> 00:46:56,908
My eyes are like
organ stops. Over.

734
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,642
We can smell the money though.
Over.

735
00:46:59,716 --> 00:47:02,583
Look, money may be your god,
but it ain't mine, all right?

736
00:47:02,652 --> 00:47:05,212
I want a warm bath
and a cup of tea. Over.

737
00:47:06,289 --> 00:47:08,849
You'll get your cup of tea.
Just you hold tight.

738
00:47:08,925 --> 00:47:12,622
Oh, lucky you.
My eyes are like organ stops. Over.

739
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:14,755
We can smell the money though.

740
00:47:14,831 --> 00:47:17,061
I rang four other
police stations before you,

741
00:47:17,134 --> 00:47:18,692
but nobody took me seriously.

742
00:47:18,768 --> 00:47:20,929
Said it was probably a hoax.

743
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:22,904
How strong was the signal,
Mr. Addey?

744
00:47:22,973 --> 00:47:25,339
I'd say they were
within a 10-mile radius.

745
00:47:25,408 --> 00:47:27,239
There must be
a ton of banks in that area.

746
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:30,479
And when was the last time
you picked them up?

747
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:33,141
They've been quiet
for about an hour.

748
00:47:33,216 --> 00:47:35,650
What about releasing
the tapes to the radio and TV?

749
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:37,346
Maybe somebody can
recognize the voices.

750
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:38,887
No no.

751
00:47:38,955 --> 00:47:41,014
They hear themselves,
they'll stop transmitting.

752
00:47:41,091 --> 00:47:42,649
No, we should keep listening.

753
00:47:42,726 --> 00:47:44,990
Maybe they'll reveal where they are.

754
00:47:45,061 --> 00:47:47,552
Alfie, you stay here with Mr. Addey.
I'm going back to the station.

755
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:49,656
You call me if you hear anything.

756
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:53,253
Hey.

757
00:48:56,166 --> 00:48:58,134
You scared the piss out of me.

758
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:04,039
- What are you doing here?
- I couldn't sleep.

759
00:49:07,043 --> 00:49:09,307
Yeah, a bit jangly myself.

760
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:11,210
I just had to come and have a look.

761
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:13,772
Our future's in those boxes.

762
00:49:17,354 --> 00:49:19,914
So what you gonna
do with your share?

763
00:49:21,258 --> 00:49:22,725
Vanish.

764
00:49:22,792 --> 00:49:24,316
Martine Love will cease to exist.

765
00:49:28,598 --> 00:49:30,862
Why, you think if you vanish
you'll become someone else?

766
00:49:31,935 --> 00:49:34,028
At least no one
will know who I was.

767
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:36,703
Why'd you pick Kev and me?

768
00:49:36,773 --> 00:49:39,571
You could've
found better thieves.

769
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:42,478
Old times' sake.

770
00:49:45,749 --> 00:49:49,116
Most of your old times
were spent with Kevin, not me.

771
00:49:49,185 --> 00:49:51,949
And Kevin has it in his mind
we had this passionate affair.

772
00:49:53,356 --> 00:49:55,586
The truth is, it came down
to four Chinese meals

773
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,149
and a roll in the hay.

774
00:49:58,695 --> 00:50:01,027
And that was a long time ago.

775
00:50:44,474 --> 00:50:46,738
All right.
Let's make some money.

776
00:51:04,794 --> 00:51:06,386
Pull it out.
Pull it out.

777
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:07,953
Look at this!

778
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:11,562
Look at all this cash.

779
00:51:11,634 --> 00:51:14,000
- Wads of it.
- Fantastic.

780
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:16,265
Guys, gold bars.

781
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:18,603
Diamonds.
Diamonds!

782
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:29,311
Guys, what's going on?

783
00:51:31,054 --> 00:51:33,648
How'd your wife fancy a tiara?

784
00:51:33,723 --> 00:51:35,247
Too bloody right.

785
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:40,288
- Get the cash. The cash!
- Look at the quality.

786
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:43,230
- Emeralds.
- This is better than winning the pools.

787
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,907
Dave, give us
a hand with this one.

788
00:52:00,884 --> 00:52:02,442
What's so special
about this box?

789
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:04,077
It's my lucky number.

790
00:52:10,927 --> 00:52:13,157
All yours, me lovely.

791
00:52:13,229 --> 00:52:14,992
- Here you are.
- Cheers.

792
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:40,722
Holy shit.
You know who that is.

793
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:42,417
That's Princess Margaret.

794
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:45,017
Terry, anything
for the widows and orphans fund?

795
00:52:46,763 --> 00:52:48,321
Will that do?

796
00:52:48,398 --> 00:52:50,696
God bless you, guv'ner,
very generous.

797
00:52:50,767 --> 00:52:52,564
Look, we have to have
some sort of system.

798
00:52:52,635 --> 00:52:54,603
You don't know what you're
throwing and what you're keeping.

799
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,161
Yeah, well, we know
what money looks like

800
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:58,002
and we're not throwing
that away, are we?

801
00:53:06,983 --> 00:53:08,575
How long does it take
to rob a bank?

802
00:53:11,588 --> 00:53:14,250
We've just about
cleaned this joint out, eh?

803
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:16,053
More cash.

804
00:53:16,125 --> 00:53:17,888
Look at this.

805
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:36,377
- No, nothing.
- No, still nothing.

806
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,573
Sarge, what we need is something
that will motivate the robbers

807
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:42,117
to go on air,
give away their location.

808
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:45,621
Right.
Bait to lure the fish.

809
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:50,524
No, they're not there.

810
00:53:50,593 --> 00:53:52,754
- Not transmitting.
- They're not there, sir.

811
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:54,956
Move to the next bank,
Sierra Lima Two.

812
00:54:03,072 --> 00:54:04,403
No.

813
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:07,068
We're still getting nothing, Sarge.

814
00:54:07,143 --> 00:54:10,635
Okay, Sierra Lima Two,
move to the next location.

815
00:54:13,349 --> 00:54:16,182
My God, the stuff
that some people collect.

816
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:19,987
- What you got there, Terry?
- '47.

817
00:54:20,056 --> 00:54:22,320
- '47?
- Sounds like a good year to me.

818
00:54:22,392 --> 00:54:24,724
- Three cheers.
- Hurray!

819
00:54:25,828 --> 00:54:28,729
Pass 'em around.
Come on, Terry, give us some!

820
00:54:40,877 --> 00:54:42,174
Dave!

821
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:46,476
Here, Major!
Get it down ya!

822
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:48,210
Fellas, they're onto you.

823
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:50,377
- Listen, they're onto you.
- Fuck.

824
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:52,478
Coppers right on your doorstep.

825
00:54:58,428 --> 00:55:00,055
Speak to me, Nightjar.

826
00:55:00,129 --> 00:55:01,756
Coppers right on your doorstep!

827
00:55:01,831 --> 00:55:03,856
Listen, hang on. Hang on.
They're not going in

828
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:06,265
but they're not going away.
Wait, wait.

829
00:55:06,336 --> 00:55:07,963
Sarge, we just heard.

830
00:55:08,037 --> 00:55:11,268
The thieves' lookout says there are
police outside the bank right now.

831
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:13,536
- Which bank?
- I haven't got a clue.

832
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:16,135
We've got patrols outside
half the banks in the West End.

833
00:55:16,212 --> 00:55:18,806
Keep listening. We need to pinpoint
exactly where they are.

834
00:55:20,216 --> 00:55:22,878
Wait, hang on.

835
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:28,982
Guys, you got a car
just pulled up, some bloke.

836
00:55:31,127 --> 00:55:32,924
He's going up
to the front door with the cops.

837
00:55:36,966 --> 00:55:38,831
Guys, he's unlocking
the front door.

838
00:55:40,136 --> 00:55:43,572
They're going in.
Shit. Over.

839
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:46,370
- Oh no.
- Shit.

840
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:50,407
- Where's the vault?
- Downstairs.

841
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:57,513
Follow me.

842
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:20,439
Looks fine.

843
00:56:24,414 --> 00:56:26,609
- I want to look inside.
- It's on a time lock.

844
00:56:26,683 --> 00:56:28,674
It can't be opened
until tomorrow morning.

845
00:56:28,751 --> 00:56:30,241
Mm-hmm.

846
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,882
Well, it isn't my bank being robbed.

847
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:44,656
Thank you.

848
00:56:46,402 --> 00:56:48,370
Fellas, I think they're going away.

849
00:56:56,412 --> 00:56:58,004
They're gone.

850
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:07,917
We should get out of here.

851
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:09,480
- They could be coming back.
- Yeah, all right.

852
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:12,460
- We need to let Eddie know.
- Nightjar.

853
00:57:15,198 --> 00:57:17,462
Nightjar!

854
00:57:17,533 --> 00:57:20,331
No! Fuck.

855
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:24,100
Shit.
Fuck.

856
00:57:24,173 --> 00:57:25,731
Shit. Oh, shit.

857
00:57:25,808 --> 00:57:27,833
Are you there, Nightjar?

858
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:33,105
The ambulance reports it's outside
the Lloyds Bank on Baker Street.

859
00:57:33,182 --> 00:57:35,412
Nightjar, can you hear me?

860
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:38,453
Have you gone asleep, Nightjar?

861
00:57:49,432 --> 00:57:51,229
Nightjar, are you there?

862
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:53,768
Look, if he's not picking up,
something's wrong.

863
00:57:53,836 --> 00:57:57,101
You're right. Let's grab all the cash
and jewels and get the fuck out of here.

864
00:57:57,173 --> 00:57:59,607
What about our gear? We can't leave
anything that might incriminate us.

865
00:57:59,675 --> 00:58:01,973
- We'll come back for it if we can.
- What about all the other boxes?

866
00:58:02,044 --> 00:58:04,979
Doesn't matter, Dave.
Put everything in a bag and let's go.

867
00:58:05,047 --> 00:58:06,674
He's right, let's move.
Come on!

868
00:58:09,452 --> 00:58:11,784
- No.
- There's nothing there, Sarge.

869
00:58:11,854 --> 00:58:13,321
You sure?

870
00:58:13,389 --> 00:58:15,721
There's no mention
of the ambulance.

871
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:17,350
Nothing, move on,
Sierra Lima Two.

872
00:58:31,574 --> 00:58:33,405
- That's them.
- Finally.

873
00:58:33,476 --> 00:58:35,034
Come on, let's go.

874
00:58:36,412 --> 00:58:38,573
The van is leaving.
We will follow them. Over.

875
00:58:38,648 --> 00:58:40,513
Stop them as soon as possible.

876
00:58:52,428 --> 00:58:53,895
Open the door!

877
00:58:53,963 --> 00:58:55,828
What have I done, guv'ner?

878
00:58:55,898 --> 00:58:58,230
Open the back door.
Come on.

879
00:58:58,301 --> 00:59:00,735
Some fella paid me 50 quid
to pick up his van

880
00:59:00,803 --> 00:59:02,270
and drop it at Heathrow Airport.

881
00:59:04,507 --> 00:59:06,441
Jesus Christ.

882
00:59:08,611 --> 00:59:10,306
- Where's the van?
- Change of plan.

883
00:59:10,379 --> 00:59:12,313
Precautionary measure.

884
00:59:12,381 --> 00:59:14,212
I've organized
alternative transport.

885
00:59:14,283 --> 00:59:17,252
- Why?
- None of us have met your boyfriend,

886
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,515
the alarm bloke
who clued you up about the job.

887
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:20,954
Could have set us up.

888
00:59:26,762 --> 00:59:28,855
We bloody well pulled it off!

889
00:59:28,931 --> 00:59:30,831
Done with military
precision, hey, Major?

890
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,391
Now, that I'm physically secure,
I think I'll promote myself to Colonel.

891
00:59:35,137 --> 00:59:37,105
Hey, do you know
what I'm gonna do?

892
00:59:37,173 --> 00:59:39,698
Buy me mum a new house,
something with a garden.

893
00:59:39,775 --> 00:59:41,936
I thought you'd be
off to Copenhagen, Dave.

894
00:59:42,011 --> 00:59:44,479
- Why would I go to Copenhagen?
- Have your cock shortened.

895
00:59:45,948 --> 00:59:48,246
Yeah, well, maybe
what they chop off of mine,

896
00:59:48,317 --> 00:59:51,013
they can add
onto your little pinkie.

897
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:19,311
How'd you find this place, Terry?

898
01:00:20,383 --> 01:00:22,749
Bloke I know used to run
a chop shop here.

899
01:00:22,818 --> 01:00:24,342
He's in the nick now.

900
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:27,617
How could you lose control
of the operation?

901
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:29,715
I thought you were
on top of this thing.

902
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:31,953
Sir, it worked. They did the job.
They robbed the vault.

903
01:00:32,028 --> 01:00:35,429
And we have no idea
where the fuck they are.

904
01:00:35,498 --> 01:00:38,126
Do you know,
an ugly thought has just occurred.

905
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,668
Lots of money in that vault...
jewelry, bonds.

906
01:00:40,736 --> 01:00:43,296
You and your sweetie haven't cooked up
something between you, I hope.

907
01:00:43,372 --> 01:00:45,897
- You think I'd betray you?
- There are precedents.

908
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:48,535
Two of our former colleagues
now live in bloody Moscow.

909
01:00:48,611 --> 01:00:50,511
Let's hope they don't
have another bidder.

910
01:00:50,579 --> 01:00:52,513
She won't cross us.
She knows what we're capable of.

911
01:00:52,581 --> 01:00:55,277
How does she even know
who the hell we are?

912
01:00:55,351 --> 01:00:58,377
I'm sure she'll contact me
when she comes to her senses.

913
01:00:58,454 --> 01:01:00,513
Going anywhere else
would be a death sentence.

914
01:01:00,589 --> 01:01:03,717
You'd better hope
she does, Everett...

915
01:01:03,793 --> 01:01:05,761
or it may be yours.

916
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:18,973
Here you go, Bambas.
That's your lot.

917
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:25,039
"Never washed after
our magic moment. Snooky."

918
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:34,722
Hey, Dave.
Look at this.

919
01:01:35,925 --> 01:01:39,156
I've seen this bloke on the TV.

920
01:01:39,228 --> 01:01:40,752
The old perv!

921
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:44,095
I've seen this face before.
He's an MP.

922
01:01:44,166 --> 01:01:46,327
Lord what's his name?
You know.

923
01:01:46,402 --> 01:01:48,370
Always wears
those poncey bowties.

924
01:01:48,437 --> 01:01:50,769
Not in that picture he's not.

925
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,671
Maybe this is one
of your old movies, Dave.

926
01:01:52,742 --> 01:01:54,232
Piss off, Kev.

927
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:55,743
Timely suggestion.

928
01:01:55,811 --> 01:01:58,109
I believe I'll take my share

929
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:00,375
and be on my way

930
01:02:00,449 --> 01:02:03,350
before the bank opens in the morning
and the shit hits the proverbial fan.

931
01:02:03,419 --> 01:02:05,387
I'm with you, Guy.

932
01:02:05,454 --> 01:02:07,422
I don't have to remind you,
keep a low profile.

933
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:08,957
No buying Aston Martins, Bambas.

934
01:02:09,025 --> 01:02:12,153
The only thing I'm buying
is a one-way ticket back to Cyprus.

935
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:13,889
I'm never coming back.

936
01:02:13,963 --> 01:02:16,124
We should have a reunion
in 20 years.

937
01:02:16,198 --> 01:02:17,995
The Savoy Grill.

938
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:20,092
Yeah, right.
Maybe for you, Guy.

939
01:02:20,169 --> 01:02:21,932
They still wouldn't
let us lot in.

940
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:25,937
- Bambo.
- Goodbye, my friend.

941
01:02:26,008 --> 01:02:27,635
Take care of yourself, mate.

942
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:29,200
And Major.

943
01:02:33,949 --> 01:02:36,315
Be lucky.

944
01:02:36,385 --> 01:02:38,114
Bambas...

945
01:02:38,187 --> 01:02:39,779
goodbye, old chap.

946
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:48,526
Okay, what's going on?
You two have been staring daggers

947
01:02:48,597 --> 01:02:50,758
at each other since you left the bank.

948
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:52,460
What is it, lovers' tiff?

949
01:02:59,875 --> 01:03:02,002
I think Martine's
got something to tell us.

950
01:03:07,083 --> 01:03:10,246
Hang about,
that's Princess Margaret.

951
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:12,082
Fuck me.

952
01:03:14,723 --> 01:03:16,190
Where'd these come from?

953
01:03:16,258 --> 01:03:19,591
You knew the exact box
this stuff was in, Martine.

954
01:03:19,662 --> 01:03:22,927
You better come clean
and tell us what this is really about.

955
01:03:25,668 --> 01:03:27,659
About a month ago,
I got busted at Heathrow

956
01:03:27,736 --> 01:03:29,931
on a drug charge.

957
01:03:30,005 --> 01:03:32,872
This guy I know said he'd
fix it to keep me out of jail

958
01:03:32,942 --> 01:03:35,376
if I do him a favor.

959
01:03:35,444 --> 01:03:36,911
He knew I knew some villains.

960
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:38,708
He wanted to set up
a robbery to get these.

961
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:41,643
Fucking hell.

962
01:03:41,717 --> 01:03:44,584
That would be the bloke you met
in the Player's Club?

963
01:03:44,653 --> 01:03:47,144
Same guy you said was trying
to pick you up in the club, right?

964
01:03:47,223 --> 01:03:49,350
- Yeah.
- So who is he?

965
01:03:49,425 --> 01:03:51,620
He's a guy I met
at the Sombrero Club.

966
01:03:51,694 --> 01:03:53,855
He works for some
shady outfit in Whitehall.

967
01:03:53,929 --> 01:03:56,124
Hold on, hold on.
What, you mean MI fucking 5?

968
01:03:56,198 --> 01:03:57,665
Or 6?

969
01:03:57,733 --> 01:04:00,167
We could get
seriously nicked here, Martine.

970
01:04:00,236 --> 01:04:03,728
No, we couldn't. All Tim wants
is the contents of box 118.

971
01:04:03,806 --> 01:04:06,900
The deal with him
is we get to keep everything else.

972
01:04:08,244 --> 01:04:09,802
And you believed that?

973
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:12,177
You put your trust in some prick
we've never even met?

974
01:04:12,248 --> 01:04:13,909
You lied to us, Martine.

975
01:04:13,983 --> 01:04:15,610
We were sitting ducks
right from the start.

976
01:04:15,684 --> 01:04:16,946
Thank you very much.

977
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:19,920
You think it's a coincidence
that you get busted for drugs

978
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:22,423
and your Tim just happens
to have a plan to rob a bank?

979
01:04:22,491 --> 01:04:24,152
This can work out.

980
01:04:24,226 --> 01:04:26,217
We give them the photos
and everything else in that box

981
01:04:26,295 --> 01:04:28,286
and we get to keep the rest
and we're free and clear.

982
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:30,229
These people aren't
regular cozzers, Martine.

983
01:04:30,299 --> 01:04:32,665
They're above that.
They do things coppers can't.

984
01:04:32,735 --> 01:04:36,193
If they think we've seen these photos,
we're as expendable as dogshit.

985
01:04:37,273 --> 01:04:39,798
Do you know what?
I've seen those shots.

986
01:04:39,875 --> 01:04:41,536
And I know
we're either dogshit

987
01:04:41,610 --> 01:04:43,703
or about to be dogshit.
I'm out of here.

988
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:46,475
I'm not waiting for a load
of spooks and coppers

989
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:49,450
to come cracking my head.
I'm splitting like Guy and Bambas.

990
01:04:49,518 --> 01:04:51,986
- Be better if we stuck together, Dave.
- Why, Tell?

991
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:54,989
'Cause we've been so truthful
with each other so far? Eh?

992
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:57,855
- Hey, come on.
- No, I'm going home, Kev,

993
01:04:57,927 --> 01:05:00,919
to see me mum.
And then I'm going far away,

994
01:05:00,996 --> 01:05:03,294
as far as I can get away from here.

995
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:09,262
We'd better get out of here too

996
01:05:09,338 --> 01:05:11,101
in case Guy or Bambas
get picked up.

997
01:05:11,173 --> 01:05:13,266
Better take the lot of this.

998
01:05:13,342 --> 01:05:16,834
There might be someone else in this
shit to cause us some more grief.

999
01:05:20,849 --> 01:05:22,783
One of those, mate.

1000
01:05:22,851 --> 01:05:25,012
Here you go, guv'ner.

1001
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:26,679
- Keep the change.
- Cor, thanks.

1002
01:05:34,697 --> 01:05:36,892
They overheard our radio chat.

1003
01:05:36,966 --> 01:05:38,399
Fucking hell.

1004
01:05:41,770 --> 01:05:43,670
"Police last night
were trying to home in

1005
01:05:43,739 --> 01:05:46,708
on a 300,000 bank raid."
They still don't know what bank it was.

1006
01:05:46,775 --> 01:05:48,140
300 grand?

1007
01:05:48,210 --> 01:05:50,838
It was a bit more than that.
More like three million.

1008
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:26,775
- Hello?
- Martine Love.

1009
01:06:26,849 --> 01:06:28,749
Thank God.
Put her through, then run a trace.

1010
01:06:30,185 --> 01:06:32,312
- It's me.
- What happened?

1011
01:06:32,388 --> 01:06:33,946
- Where the hell are you?
- London.

1012
01:06:34,023 --> 01:06:36,685
- I know, of course. I mean where?
- I know what you mean.

1013
01:06:36,759 --> 01:06:38,556
- Martine, we have to meet.
- I agree.

1014
01:06:38,627 --> 01:06:42,028
Why don't you come over to my place?
I'll make you a cocktail.

1015
01:06:42,097 --> 01:06:44,622
We'll have a roll in the hay
for old times' sake.

1016
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:47,692
Oh, right. You've already
been there, haven't you?

1017
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:50,398
Probably have your men
keeping lookout for me now.

1018
01:06:50,472 --> 01:06:52,940
You're not in a position
to play games, Martine.

1019
01:06:53,008 --> 01:06:55,499
No threats, please, Tim.

1020
01:06:55,577 --> 01:06:57,977
Why didn't you tell me what it was
I was set up to get for you?

1021
01:06:58,047 --> 01:06:59,742
For your own good.

1022
01:06:59,815 --> 01:07:01,476
I care about your safety, Martine.

1023
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:03,074
Right.

1024
01:07:04,853 --> 01:07:07,617
I suppose I give you what you want,
we go our separate ways.

1025
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:09,715
- Well, that's what I promised.
- Okay.

1026
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:13,091
Today, Tottenham Court Road tube,
northern line, northbound platform.

1027
01:07:13,162 --> 01:07:14,629
10:30 sharp.

1028
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:16,961
Tottenham Court Road, 10:30.

1029
01:07:17,032 --> 01:07:18,590
Good.

1030
01:07:18,667 --> 01:07:21,295
"London vaults checked
after radio ham

1031
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:23,270
tunes in to a crime."

1032
01:07:23,339 --> 01:07:25,899
Christ! What a fiasco!

1033
01:07:25,974 --> 01:07:28,602
And now the particular bank
has been identified,

1034
01:07:28,677 --> 01:07:30,201
the story will be
all over the news.

1035
01:07:30,279 --> 01:07:32,042
We've heard it already is.

1036
01:07:34,316 --> 01:07:36,216
If we don't get
onto the case quickly,

1037
01:07:36,285 --> 01:07:37,877
the police will have
nabbed these robbers

1038
01:07:37,953 --> 01:07:40,444
and God knows what
will happen to our photographs.

1039
01:07:40,522 --> 01:07:42,422
Phillip, get over to the bank.

1040
01:07:42,491 --> 01:07:44,516
Take control of the situation.

1041
01:07:45,761 --> 01:07:47,490
Gentlemen.

1042
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:50,464
I've just had a conversation
with one Martine Love.

1043
01:07:50,532 --> 01:07:52,966
- Where is she?
- Call was traced to a public phone box

1044
01:07:53,035 --> 01:07:56,129
in Earls Court. The good news is,
she's arranged to meet.

1045
01:07:56,205 --> 01:07:57,797
That is good news.

1046
01:07:57,873 --> 01:07:59,568
I'll be better off going alone.

1047
01:07:59,641 --> 01:08:01,165
Yeah.

1048
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:03,803
- Tim's agreed to meet.
- It's all over the news.

1049
01:08:04,947 --> 01:08:07,279
They found the location
of the bank.

1050
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:08,873
So what?

1051
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:13,111
Stand back.
Please stand back.

1052
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:15,947
Keep the change.

1053
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:20,019
I'm sorry, ma'am. You can't go in.
There's been a robbery.

1054
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:22,029
We know there's been a robbery.
That's why we're all here.

1055
01:08:36,078 --> 01:08:38,410
Everybody that works here...
that means everybody...

1056
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:39,947
speak to them.

1057
01:08:40,015 --> 01:08:42,245
Gerald!

1058
01:08:42,317 --> 01:08:44,251
You work in robbery now, then?

1059
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:45,843
You're a long way
off your patch.

1060
01:08:45,921 --> 01:08:48,151
Regional Crime Squad now.

1061
01:08:48,223 --> 01:08:50,384
Just dropped by to see
what all the fuss is about.

1062
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:52,950
Pretty cheeky,
that radio bit.

1063
01:08:53,028 --> 01:08:55,656
These walkie-talkie robbers certainly
caught your lot on the hop.

1064
01:08:55,731 --> 01:08:57,631
Makes us all look stupid.

1065
01:08:57,699 --> 01:09:00,862
Yeah, well, you're pretty chummy
with all the villains around town.

1066
01:09:00,936 --> 01:09:03,530
You got any idea
who could've done this?

1067
01:09:03,605 --> 01:09:05,766
None of my informants.

1068
01:09:07,075 --> 01:09:09,066
We have been waiting here
quite some time

1069
01:09:09,144 --> 01:09:11,203
and so far you people
have told us absolutely nothing.

1070
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:14,772
If you would like to give us an itemized
list of the contents of your boxes,

1071
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:16,442
we may be able to ascertain
what's missing.

1072
01:09:16,518 --> 01:09:19,487
Are you mad? The whole point
of having a safe deposit box

1073
01:09:19,555 --> 01:09:22,080
is so that people like you
don't know what's in it.

1074
01:09:24,092 --> 01:09:27,152
- I want to speak to a Roy Given.
- Yeah, that's me.

1075
01:09:27,229 --> 01:09:30,164
This robbery's now a matter of
national security. I want everybody out.

1076
01:09:30,232 --> 01:09:32,223
This is a police investigation.

1077
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:35,429
Not anymore.
Call your superiors.

1078
01:09:37,639 --> 01:09:39,732
Who the bloody hell
does he think is?

1079
01:09:39,808 --> 01:09:42,174
Spooks.
5 or 6,

1080
01:09:42,244 --> 01:09:45,042
I can never tell the difference.
They all go to the same tailor

1081
01:09:45,113 --> 01:09:47,411
and they all went
to the same bloody school.

1082
01:09:47,483 --> 01:09:49,781
Let's get some copies
of the walkie-talkie tapes

1083
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:52,184
out to the news boys.

1084
01:09:52,254 --> 01:09:54,381
Maybe the public
can help identify the villains.

1085
01:09:56,124 --> 01:09:57,921
So tell me...

1086
01:09:57,993 --> 01:09:59,483
which of the boxes
were ransacked?

1087
01:09:59,561 --> 01:10:01,620
The lot:
100s through the 400s.

1088
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:08,397
Well, we're in the crapper, Gerry.
Both of us.

1089
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:10,870
Both?
Why is it my problem?

1090
01:10:10,939 --> 01:10:12,907
Accounts have to be balanced,
records kept.

1091
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:15,671
And I wouldn't likely keep the books
around here, now would I?

1092
01:10:15,744 --> 01:10:18,542
Spell it out, Lew.
Be more specific.

1093
01:10:20,616 --> 01:10:22,413
I have a ledger...

1094
01:10:22,484 --> 01:10:24,782
a record of every payment
I've ever made

1095
01:10:24,853 --> 01:10:26,411
to you and your colleagues.

1096
01:10:26,488 --> 01:10:29,252
It was in my safety deposit box.

1097
01:10:29,324 --> 01:10:32,418
And I think we can safely assume it's
now in the possession of the robbers.

1098
01:10:32,494 --> 01:10:34,325
Jesus wept.

1099
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:36,330
And I think you'll agree,
we have to find those villains

1100
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:37,831
before your honest
colleagues do.

1101
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,265
For fuck's sake.

1102
01:10:48,043 --> 01:10:50,477
- Who is this?
- Lew Vogel.

1103
01:10:50,546 --> 01:10:52,673
Hold on. Get up.

1104
01:10:52,748 --> 01:10:54,306
Go on. Wake up.

1105
01:10:57,419 --> 01:10:59,683
What you want, Lew?

1106
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:03,589
I'm afraid I've got some potentially
bad news for you, Michael.

1107
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:06,958
Your safety deposit box
at the Baker Street bank...

1108
01:11:07,029 --> 01:11:09,259
- what's its number?
- Why do you ask?

1109
01:11:09,331 --> 01:11:12,459
Well, over the weekend some thieves
broke into the bank vault and robbed it.

1110
01:11:12,534 --> 01:11:15,731
So if your box is
in the 100 to 400 numbers,

1111
01:11:15,804 --> 01:11:18,705
I'm afraid all your stuff will be gone.
Mine too, unhappily.

1112
01:11:18,774 --> 01:11:20,571
What? How can this
happen in London?

1113
01:11:20,642 --> 01:11:22,303
Well, I promise you,
it has happened.

1114
01:11:22,377 --> 01:11:25,676
And I promise you, these thieves
will be found and dealt with.

1115
01:11:25,747 --> 01:11:28,272
You can rely on it.
I'll keep you informed.

1116
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:29,908
Thank you.

1117
01:12:11,126 --> 01:12:13,185
Mind the gap, please.

1118
01:12:36,418 --> 01:12:37,942
Anyone touches me,
follows me,

1119
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:40,215
Martine takes your snaps
right to Fleet Street, understood?

1120
01:12:47,863 --> 01:12:50,058
You want box 118, Tim.

1121
01:12:50,132 --> 01:12:52,862
You have no idea the danger you
and your chums are in, do you?

1122
01:12:52,934 --> 01:12:54,765
Is that right?
And why would that be?

1123
01:12:54,836 --> 01:12:57,031
You've opened Pandora's Box,
you dumb prick.

1124
01:12:57,105 --> 01:12:59,539
- That's why.
- I know what's at stake.

1125
01:12:59,608 --> 01:13:01,667
And I know how
expendable we are.

1126
01:13:01,743 --> 01:13:03,404
- So I'm changing the deal.
- Is that right?

1127
01:13:03,478 --> 01:13:06,811
Yeah.
You get all your nasty pictures,

1128
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:08,543
but here's the twist:

1129
01:13:08,617 --> 01:13:10,847
We get indemnity...
fresh passports,

1130
01:13:10,919 --> 01:13:13,387
safe passage out of the country
for the whole team,

1131
01:13:13,455 --> 01:13:15,685
and an official signed
document guaranteeing

1132
01:13:15,757 --> 01:13:17,748
we won't be prosecuted
and we won't be pursued.

1133
01:13:17,826 --> 01:13:21,227
- You can't be serious.
- You can bet your bollocks I'm serious.

1134
01:13:21,296 --> 01:13:23,457
And we want it signed,
sealed and delivered

1135
01:13:23,532 --> 01:13:26,023
by a public figure
of substantial authority.

1136
01:13:26,101 --> 01:13:28,160
- How about the Prime Minister?
- Yeah, he'll do.

1137
01:13:28,236 --> 01:13:31,000
If you can drag him off his yacht.

1138
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:32,904
You mess with us, Tim...

1139
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:36,303
we can drip-feed
pictures like this to the press.

1140
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:43,274
We've got a stack of 'em.

1141
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:47,021
Oh, dear.

1142
01:13:49,057 --> 01:13:51,457
You've got until 4:00 p.m.
To confirm we have a deal.

1143
01:13:51,526 --> 01:13:53,050
We'll be in touch.

1144
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:01,396
- Some photographs.
- Well done, Tim.

1145
01:14:15,183 --> 01:14:16,616
Do you have any more?

1146
01:14:16,685 --> 01:14:18,676
Apparently, there was
a whole rogue's gallery

1147
01:14:18,754 --> 01:14:20,779
stored in one of the boxes.

1148
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:30,560
If Lord Drysdale is up
to his usual hanky-panky,

1149
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:32,463
that's his problem.

1150
01:14:32,534 --> 01:14:36,163
This operation is about recovering
the photos from Michael X.

1151
01:14:36,238 --> 01:14:38,172
Might it not be prudent to get
the committee

1152
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:41,300
to consider issuing
a D-Notice

1153
01:14:41,376 --> 01:14:44,573
to protect everyone potentially
embarrassed by this criminal activity?

1154
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:46,204
Which we instigated.

1155
01:14:51,019 --> 01:14:54,648
Very nice.
Very nice indeed.

1156
01:14:55,757 --> 01:14:58,317
When I came out, there were
a couple of lads taking some photos.

1157
01:14:59,861 --> 01:15:01,158
Photos of him.

1158
01:15:01,229 --> 01:15:03,288
Now he was standing
right outside the bank

1159
01:15:03,365 --> 01:15:05,094
just a few days
before it was robbed.

1160
01:15:06,301 --> 01:15:07,825
I thought at the time
he looked a bit shifty.

1161
01:15:09,871 --> 01:15:11,463
Oh my God!

1162
01:15:12,541 --> 01:15:14,168
Christ, is that thing real?

1163
01:15:15,644 --> 01:15:17,669
I've got it:
Dave Shilling.

1164
01:15:17,746 --> 01:15:19,714
That's his name.

1165
01:15:21,583 --> 01:15:23,278
- Ta-ta, Mum.
- Look after yourself, love.

1166
01:15:25,053 --> 01:15:26,884
Go and get yourself inside,
you'll catch your death.

1167
01:15:33,728 --> 01:15:36,288
- Dave Shilling?
- Yeah?

1168
01:15:36,364 --> 01:15:38,594
I wonder if we could have a word?

1169
01:15:39,668 --> 01:15:41,693
- About what?
- About a bank.

1170
01:15:49,344 --> 01:15:52,040
I want to tell you something,
Mr. Shilling, 'cause it'll save time.

1171
01:15:53,515 --> 01:15:55,540
You see...

1172
01:15:55,617 --> 01:15:57,517
I have a very
jaundiced view of life.

1173
01:15:58,787 --> 01:16:02,245
From what I see, most of it's corrupt,
venal and vile.

1174
01:16:02,324 --> 01:16:05,191
And I'm just saying this so that you
know that I don't have

1175
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:07,888
a better nature to appeal to
or a compassionate streak.

1176
01:16:07,963 --> 01:16:10,193
You do understand, don't you?

1177
01:16:10,265 --> 01:16:12,290
- I think so, Mr. Vogel.
- Good.

1178
01:16:16,771 --> 01:16:19,171
I have a kidney stone.

1179
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:21,334
I don't seem to be able to pass it.
I'm on painkillers.

1180
01:16:23,044 --> 01:16:25,376
I could use a couple of those myself.

1181
01:16:31,887 --> 01:16:33,787
You stole from me...

1182
01:16:34,856 --> 01:16:37,086
and from friends of mine.

1183
01:16:39,361 --> 01:16:42,091
- Where's my stuff?
- I don't know.

1184
01:16:42,163 --> 01:16:45,360
Look, I don't know anything
about any bank robbery. Honest.

1185
01:16:45,433 --> 01:16:48,334
Still an unconvincing actor,
Mr. Shilling.

1186
01:16:57,312 --> 01:16:59,542
I would love to say
this is not going to hurt,

1187
01:16:59,614 --> 01:17:02,014
but it is.

1188
01:17:11,526 --> 01:17:13,016
What are you going to do?

1189
01:17:14,529 --> 01:17:16,156
No no!

1190
01:17:16,231 --> 01:17:18,165
No! Stop!

1191
01:17:18,233 --> 01:17:19,700
Please!

1192
01:17:19,768 --> 01:17:21,497
Don't! Please!

1193
01:17:28,243 --> 01:17:31,269
- Well, they were here.
- Well, they ain't here now.

1194
01:17:34,249 --> 01:17:35,773
Why is the door open?

1195
01:17:41,489 --> 01:17:43,150
Who are you?

1196
01:17:43,224 --> 01:17:45,021
I could ask the same thing.

1197
01:17:45,093 --> 01:17:47,027
Better run along, eh?

1198
01:17:47,095 --> 01:17:49,393
Get yourselves a cup of tea
or something.

1199
01:18:00,675 --> 01:18:02,438
We're looking for Terry Leather.

1200
01:18:02,510 --> 01:18:03,977
Terry said he won't be
coming in this week.

1201
01:18:04,045 --> 01:18:06,411
- He's supposed to call in.
- Ah.

1202
01:18:06,481 --> 01:18:08,108
So you'd be Eddie, right?

1203
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:11,380
- Uh, yeah.
- Well, you're coming with me.

1204
01:18:11,453 --> 01:18:14,388
Leave him alone.
What do you want with my Eddie?

1205
01:18:14,456 --> 01:18:16,151
- Shut your noise.
- Leave her alone!

1206
01:18:16,224 --> 01:18:18,089
We want to talk to him
about a bank robbery.

1207
01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:20,320
- Don't you touch her!
- If you want to see your Eddie

1208
01:18:20,395 --> 01:18:22,488
or his mate Dave again, make sure
Terry Leather calls that number.

1209
01:18:22,564 --> 01:18:23,929
What?

1210
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:26,661
Walkie-Talkie Gang takes it all!

1211
01:18:26,735 --> 01:18:28,760
Read all about it!

1212
01:18:28,837 --> 01:18:31,067
Walkie-Talkie Gang takes it all!

1213
01:18:31,139 --> 01:18:33,073
That's great news. Over.

1214
01:18:33,141 --> 01:18:35,837
We're taking a break.
We need to get some sleep,

1215
01:18:35,910 --> 01:18:37,741
get a bit of shuteye
while the fumes clear out.

1216
01:18:37,812 --> 01:18:40,178
- Over.
- Oh, lucky you.

1217
01:18:40,248 --> 01:18:41,715
My eyes are like organ stops...

1218
01:18:41,783 --> 01:18:44,251
Mummy, Daddy's on the radio.

1219
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:46,310
- Oh, don't be so silly, darling.
- He is!

1220
01:18:47,789 --> 01:18:49,484
Is he?

1221
01:18:49,557 --> 01:18:51,889
I want a warm bath
and a cup of tea. Over.

1222
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:55,088
You'll get your cup of tea.
Just you hold tight. Over.

1223
01:18:55,163 --> 01:18:57,063
See, it is Daddy.

1224
01:18:57,132 --> 01:18:58,656
Authorities have
released this recording

1225
01:18:58,733 --> 01:19:00,257
of the walkie-talkie
communications

1226
01:19:00,335 --> 01:19:02,803
between the robbers
of Lloyds Bank in Marylebone

1227
01:19:02,871 --> 01:19:04,600
in the hopes that their voices
may be identified

1228
01:19:04,672 --> 01:19:06,606
by members of the public...

1229
01:19:06,674 --> 01:19:09,108
- Hello?
- Wendy?

1230
01:19:10,211 --> 01:19:12,338
We heard you on the radio, Terry.
You're famous, you know?

1231
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:15,212
You robbed that bank, didn't you?
The one in the news?

1232
01:19:15,283 --> 01:19:18,275
Oh God, you could go
to jail for years

1233
01:19:18,353 --> 01:19:20,184
for something like that, Terry.
I couldn't stand it.

1234
01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:23,315
No one's going to jail.
I've got it all under control.

1235
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:26,121
Just stay put,
keep the kids inside.

1236
01:19:28,229 --> 01:19:30,163
I love you, Wendy.

1237
01:19:31,266 --> 01:19:32,790
I've got to go.

1238
01:19:33,902 --> 01:19:35,995
- You be careful, Terry.
- What's the matter, Mum?

1239
01:19:37,505 --> 01:19:39,166
Nothing, darling.

1240
01:19:42,544 --> 01:19:45,877
Terry, they took Eddie.

1241
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:48,313
- Oh God, who?
- They weren't thieves or...

1242
01:19:48,383 --> 01:19:52,217
I don't know, they could have been cops.
They left a phone number for you.

1243
01:19:52,287 --> 01:19:54,016
They said if I wanted to see Dave

1244
01:19:54,089 --> 01:19:56,353
or Eddie again
then you have to call.

1245
01:19:56,424 --> 01:19:58,517
Listen to me, Ingrid.
I swear to you I'll get him back.

1246
01:19:58,593 --> 01:20:00,959
- Don't you worry, darling.
- Have you got a pen?

1247
01:20:01,029 --> 01:20:03,361
Yeah.

1248
01:20:03,431 --> 01:20:06,525
- 0-1-9-4-6...
- Hold on, say it again.

1249
01:20:06,601 --> 01:20:09,126
- 0-1-9-4-6...
- Yeah.

1250
01:20:13,374 --> 01:20:15,808
- Michael, it's Lew Vogel.
- Yes?

1251
01:20:15,877 --> 01:20:17,538
Well, we've identified the villains.

1252
01:20:17,612 --> 01:20:21,013
And believe it or not,
they're amateurs. Part-timers.

1253
01:20:21,082 --> 01:20:24,051
They were put up to the job by a woman
named Martine Love.

1254
01:20:24,119 --> 01:20:26,212
- Ring a bell?
- Never heard of her.

1255
01:20:26,287 --> 01:20:27,686
Well, we paid a visit to her flat

1256
01:20:27,755 --> 01:20:30,622
and some chaps
from Ml5 were already there.

1257
01:20:30,692 --> 01:20:32,990
Pulled rank on my tamed copper.

1258
01:20:34,529 --> 01:20:37,123
Why do you suppose these people
would be interested in the robbery

1259
01:20:37,198 --> 01:20:38,859
of a minor neighborhood
bank, Michael?

1260
01:20:38,933 --> 01:20:41,231
- I don't know.
- I think you do.

1261
01:20:41,302 --> 01:20:44,794
And I'm guessing
that your box is number 118.

1262
01:20:45,974 --> 01:20:48,841
I think what these robbers
were really after were photographs.

1263
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:51,344
Photographs
of a certain Royal Princess.

1264
01:20:51,412 --> 01:20:53,141
How you know that?

1265
01:20:53,214 --> 01:20:55,739
Because on this point
I believe my captive.

1266
01:20:55,817 --> 01:20:58,251
No man could withstand
the pain we inflicted on him.

1267
01:20:58,319 --> 01:21:00,947
So don't take me
for a fool, Michael.

1268
01:21:01,022 --> 01:21:02,956
You've instigated this calamity

1269
01:21:03,024 --> 01:21:05,254
by storing your blackmail materials
in this bank.

1270
01:21:05,326 --> 01:21:07,521
Which you recommended.
I will not be lectured

1271
01:21:07,595 --> 01:21:09,893
by the porn king of Soho.
Get my pictures back

1272
01:21:09,964 --> 01:21:13,161
or you will never see a black man
on the streets of London

1273
01:21:13,234 --> 01:21:15,532
without wondering if he's
been sent to kill you.

1274
01:21:37,525 --> 01:21:39,993
- What are you doing?
- Oh, hello, Michael.

1275
01:21:40,061 --> 01:21:42,495
Hakim was looking
for a copy of his book.

1276
01:21:44,132 --> 01:21:46,896
I know what you've been looking for,
bird, and you won't find it.

1277
01:21:48,169 --> 01:21:49,796
What are you talking about?

1278
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:53,973
Hakim, I found your book.

1279
01:21:54,042 --> 01:21:56,237
You don't understand.

1280
01:21:56,311 --> 01:21:58,745
My box and those of my friends

1281
01:21:58,813 --> 01:22:01,247
may have been rifled.

1282
01:22:01,316 --> 01:22:02,806
Surely you can pull some strings.

1283
01:22:02,884 --> 01:22:04,977
You're a minister in the government,
for God's sake.

1284
01:22:05,053 --> 01:22:07,613
Sonia, I really don't think
I'm able to help here.

1285
01:22:07,689 --> 01:22:09,316
Perhaps you don't
fully comprehend.

1286
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:12,552
I have photographs,

1287
01:22:12,627 --> 01:22:14,254
compromising photographs;

1288
01:22:14,329 --> 01:22:16,820
live film of you,

1289
01:22:16,898 --> 01:22:19,526
Miles Urquhart,
all my regulars,

1290
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:22,365
in this safe deposit box.

1291
01:22:22,437 --> 01:22:25,429
You all know each other,
if that's any consolation.

1292
01:22:25,506 --> 01:22:27,701
You've got photographs of me?

1293
01:22:27,775 --> 01:22:30,107
You conniving cunt!

1294
01:22:33,915 --> 01:22:36,406
You be a big boy.

1295
01:22:36,484 --> 01:22:39,681
Now's the time to talk to
your Whitehall chums, don't you think?

1296
01:22:42,123 --> 01:22:43,681
That's him.
I'm sure that's him.

1297
01:22:45,493 --> 01:22:47,427
Guy Arthur Singer.

1298
01:22:47,495 --> 01:22:49,486
Con man and petty criminal.

1299
01:22:49,564 --> 01:22:51,429
Did a stretch in the Scrubs
a few years back.

1300
01:22:51,499 --> 01:22:53,933
Thought he was a wanker.
Spoke with some poncey accent.

1301
01:22:56,037 --> 01:22:57,800
Thank you, sir, very much.

1302
01:23:04,279 --> 01:23:07,077
- Hello?
- Who am I talking to?

1303
01:23:07,148 --> 01:23:09,946
Oh, Terry Leather,
Kevin Swain, Martine Love,

1304
01:23:10,018 --> 01:23:11,485
Eddie Burton.

1305
01:23:11,552 --> 01:23:13,816
Yeah, Mr. Shilling was kind enough
to speak with me about this.

1306
01:23:13,888 --> 01:23:15,583
You put Dave on the phone, eh?

1307
01:23:15,657 --> 01:23:17,750
Well, I would but...

1308
01:23:17,825 --> 01:23:19,690
he seems a bit
indisposed at the moment.

1309
01:23:20,762 --> 01:23:21,922
What do you want?

1310
01:23:21,996 --> 01:23:24,089
Just a couple of things
from what you stole.

1311
01:23:24,165 --> 01:23:26,895
A ledger with a dark red cover.

1312
01:23:26,968 --> 01:23:30,199
And some photos that I'm sure
Ml5 is interested in.

1313
01:23:30,271 --> 01:23:32,865
The Royal Portfolio.

1314
01:23:34,042 --> 01:23:36,010
All we got is money and jewels.

1315
01:23:36,077 --> 01:23:38,272
Then I suggest you look again.

1316
01:23:38,346 --> 01:23:40,541
Speak to your friends.

1317
01:23:40,615 --> 01:23:43,049
- Hello. Who's this?
- Eddie? It's Terry.

1318
01:23:43,117 --> 01:23:45,813
Terry.
Terry, fucking hell.

1319
01:23:46,988 --> 01:23:49,855
Dave's all messed up and they're
going to do the same to me.

1320
01:23:49,924 --> 01:23:52,552
- You've got to help.
- Listen to me, Eddie.

1321
01:23:52,627 --> 01:23:54,857
I don't have what he wants.

1322
01:23:54,929 --> 01:23:56,726
What? No!

1323
01:23:56,798 --> 01:23:59,528
No you've got to have
what they want, you've got to.

1324
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,124
You've got to help.

1325
01:24:01,202 --> 01:24:03,932
Eddie, what am I supposed to do?
You tell him we don't have it.

1326
01:24:04,005 --> 01:24:06,235
No, Terry!
Terry, you've got to help.

1327
01:24:06,307 --> 01:24:08,935
Eddie, you tell him I don't
have his fucking ledger!

1328
01:24:09,010 --> 01:24:11,501
You tell that cunt now.

1329
01:24:12,714 --> 01:24:14,511
He doesn't have it.

1330
01:24:14,582 --> 01:24:16,447
Right.

1331
01:24:18,152 --> 01:24:20,620
What are you going to do?
No, don't!

1332
01:24:20,688 --> 01:24:23,054
No! No!

1333
01:24:23,124 --> 01:24:24,284
They shot Dave!

1334
01:24:24,359 --> 01:24:25,986
- Eddie?
- Dave's dead.

1335
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:28,790
- Eddie! Eddie!
- They shot Dave.

1336
01:24:31,532 --> 01:24:33,625
I'll give you one hour
to find what I want

1337
01:24:33,701 --> 01:24:35,566
or I'll kill this man too.

1338
01:24:52,019 --> 01:24:54,044
Fuck.

1339
01:24:54,122 --> 01:24:56,022
This is it.

1340
01:24:58,126 --> 01:24:59,957
Lew Vogel.

1341
01:25:00,027 --> 01:25:02,052
That's who this bastard is.

1342
01:25:03,898 --> 01:25:07,299
Payments made
to Soho West End Division Officers.

1343
01:25:09,871 --> 01:25:12,396
They're the weekly payouts.

1344
01:25:12,473 --> 01:25:15,169
50 quid here, 20 there.

1345
01:25:16,511 --> 01:25:18,308
Probably every
bent copper in London.

1346
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:21,739
Nothing like this
was supposed to happen.

1347
01:25:21,816 --> 01:25:24,444
- No one was supposed to get hurt.
- It's not your fault.

1348
01:25:24,519 --> 01:25:26,817
We've still got our own necks
to think about and Eddie.

1349
01:25:26,888 --> 01:25:29,721
Look, we give the photos to Vogel,
all bets are off with Tim.

1350
01:25:30,892 --> 01:25:33,190
We deliver them to Tim,
it's Eddie's neck,

1351
01:25:33,261 --> 01:25:34,819
Vogel and his lot are after us.

1352
01:25:34,896 --> 01:25:37,160
Either way, we are fucked.

1353
01:25:41,002 --> 01:25:43,630
Miles, we've got a problem,

1354
01:25:43,704 --> 01:25:45,262
a serious problem...

1355
01:25:45,339 --> 01:25:46,966
something Sonia Burn
kept in the bank

1356
01:25:47,041 --> 01:25:48,941
that was robbed
over the weekend.

1357
01:25:49,010 --> 01:25:50,944
She is concerned
that her safe deposit box

1358
01:25:51,012 --> 01:25:52,536
may have been plundered.

1359
01:25:52,613 --> 01:25:55,446
I'm afraid her fears
are well justified.

1360
01:25:56,784 --> 01:25:58,718
Oh my God.

1361
01:25:58,786 --> 01:26:01,812
I really thought Sonia was a woman
of more discreet character.

1362
01:26:03,658 --> 01:26:05,592
So...

1363
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:07,389
the genie is out
of the bottle then.

1364
01:26:07,462 --> 01:26:08,929
For both of us, eh?

1365
01:26:08,996 --> 01:26:11,863
Not quite yet.
My operatives tell me

1366
01:26:11,933 --> 01:26:15,460
that the thieves are using
the photographs as a bargaining chip.

1367
01:26:15,536 --> 01:26:18,630
- Then give them what they want.
- Already in motion.

1368
01:26:18,706 --> 01:26:20,173
And the committee
have it in the works

1369
01:26:20,241 --> 01:26:23,335
to issue a D-Notice
on the whole business...

1370
01:26:24,412 --> 01:26:26,312
muffle the press,

1371
01:26:26,380 --> 01:26:28,007
put a lid on it.

1372
01:26:37,024 --> 01:26:38,548
What?

1373
01:27:07,221 --> 01:27:08,950
Be a pity, wouldn't it?

1374
01:27:09,023 --> 01:27:12,550
I mean, if your mates abandoned
you over a few photographs and...

1375
01:27:20,134 --> 01:27:23,695
- Hello.
- You listen to me, Mr. Vogel,

1376
01:27:23,771 --> 01:27:26,535
or whatever your fucking name is.
You go ahead and kill him.

1377
01:27:26,607 --> 01:27:28,768
See if we give a shit.
We got our loot.

1378
01:27:28,843 --> 01:27:32,711
Your ledgers and your photos, you can
pick them up from Scotland Yard.

1379
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:34,975
- We're sending them over.
- Don't do that.

1380
01:27:35,049 --> 01:27:37,916
Well, if you want your
book of payoffs back,

1381
01:27:37,985 --> 01:27:40,715
be at Paddington Station
in person tomorrow 11:00 a.m.

1382
01:27:40,788 --> 01:27:42,255
Platform one.

1383
01:27:42,323 --> 01:27:46,191
There's a newsstand
near the statue of the soldier.

1384
01:27:46,260 --> 01:27:48,626
Have Eddie with you,
hale and hearty.

1385
01:27:48,696 --> 01:27:50,960
This is your one
and only chance, Vogel.

1386
01:27:51,032 --> 01:27:52,556
Don't blow it.

1387
01:28:10,217 --> 01:28:13,448
Don't answer it!
Catherine!

1388
01:28:13,521 --> 01:28:15,955
- Daddy!
- Hello, you. Come here.

1389
01:28:19,393 --> 01:28:21,759
Here look, I got you a present.

1390
01:28:21,829 --> 01:28:23,797
- You been good for Mummy?
- Yeah.

1391
01:28:29,270 --> 01:28:32,330
I need to talk to Mummy about something,
so give us a minute, okay?

1392
01:28:32,406 --> 01:28:34,374
- Go on.
- Go on.

1393
01:28:45,586 --> 01:28:48,111
So do you want to tell me
what's been going on?

1394
01:28:49,890 --> 01:28:51,448
Some bloke's worked over Dave.

1395
01:28:51,525 --> 01:28:53,425
How bad?

1396
01:28:54,562 --> 01:28:56,325
He's dead.

1397
01:28:56,397 --> 01:28:59,059
Oh my God almighty, Terry!

1398
01:28:59,133 --> 01:29:00,623
What have you done to us?

1399
01:29:00,701 --> 01:29:03,101
Wendy, I promise,

1400
01:29:03,170 --> 01:29:04,603
I'm going to work this out.

1401
01:29:04,672 --> 01:29:06,503
And when I do,
we're going to leave England

1402
01:29:06,574 --> 01:29:08,098
and it is all going
to change for us.

1403
01:29:10,478 --> 01:29:12,241
If anything goes wrong, use this.

1404
01:29:12,313 --> 01:29:13,871
There's plenty of cash...

1405
01:29:13,948 --> 01:29:16,075
pounds, francs, dollars.

1406
01:29:16,150 --> 01:29:18,812
You can leave the country,
start a new life for you and the girls.

1407
01:29:18,886 --> 01:29:20,979
You can do this
if you have to, Wendy.

1408
01:29:21,055 --> 01:29:23,523
- Promise me.
- That from the robbery, is it?

1409
01:29:25,626 --> 01:29:26,923
My share, yeah.

1410
01:29:26,994 --> 01:29:29,622
The papers said
that there was a woman in the vault.

1411
01:29:29,697 --> 01:29:32,029
Martine was it,
was she involved?

1412
01:29:32,099 --> 01:29:34,533
Yeah, she brought us
the job in the first place.

1413
01:29:34,602 --> 01:29:36,593
Oh, and did you
sleep with her, Terry?

1414
01:29:45,713 --> 01:29:48,910
Do you know what?
From day one it was always you.

1415
01:29:48,983 --> 01:29:51,383
The first day we met,
I said to my friend Audrey,

1416
01:29:51,452 --> 01:29:53,750
I said,
"I am going to marry him.

1417
01:29:53,821 --> 01:29:56,255
And I am going to have his kids."

1418
01:29:56,323 --> 01:29:58,348
And I have stuck by you.

1419
01:29:58,426 --> 01:30:00,690
I have stuck by you no matter what!

1420
01:30:00,761 --> 01:30:02,695
You bastard!

1421
01:30:06,734 --> 01:30:08,429
Fuck.

1422
01:30:16,410 --> 01:30:18,071
You can throw me over.

1423
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:20,838
I deserve it.

1424
01:30:22,516 --> 01:30:24,677
I've brought you more grief
than happiness.

1425
01:30:24,752 --> 01:30:27,880
But I love you
and the kids.

1426
01:30:30,424 --> 01:30:33,222
That's the reason I did this, to get us
out of this life once and for all.

1427
01:30:34,395 --> 01:30:36,056
Mummy, open the door!

1428
01:30:40,034 --> 01:30:41,729
- Mummy, Mummy!
- We'll work the rest out later.

1429
01:30:41,802 --> 01:30:43,565
Go and play in your room!

1430
01:30:46,741 --> 01:30:48,265
If you'll still have me.

1431
01:31:12,767 --> 01:31:14,234
She takes a good picture, eh, Tim?

1432
01:31:16,137 --> 01:31:17,934
Lord Mountbatten has
graciously agreed to represent

1433
01:31:18,005 --> 01:31:19,802
the interests of the Crown
in this matter.

1434
01:31:19,874 --> 01:31:22,775
- He high enough up the tree?
- Lord Mountbatten?

1435
01:31:22,843 --> 01:31:24,606
I've always wanted
to meet that bugger.

1436
01:31:24,678 --> 01:31:26,703
Yes. Well, I'm sure he'll be
very pleased to meet you too.

1437
01:31:26,781 --> 01:31:28,646
He has to be under the main clock,
Paddington Station,

1438
01:31:28,716 --> 01:31:30,115
11:00 a.m. Or no deal.

1439
01:31:30,184 --> 01:31:33,381
11:00 a.m. On the knocker with your
new passports and documents.

1440
01:31:33,454 --> 01:31:35,649
He'll hand them over
as soon as he sees the photos.

1441
01:31:35,723 --> 01:31:37,247
There's another problem.

1442
01:31:37,324 --> 01:31:39,417
This robbery has pissed off
some local villains.

1443
01:31:39,493 --> 01:31:41,188
The guts come with the glory, eh?

1444
01:31:41,262 --> 01:31:43,594
One of our mates has been killed.

1445
01:31:43,664 --> 01:31:45,825
It's hardly surprising
considering the roster of reprobates

1446
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:48,733
who are the bank's
deposit box customers.

1447
01:31:48,803 --> 01:31:50,395
Listen, Terry, our commitment
is for the recovery

1448
01:31:50,471 --> 01:31:52,234
of the royal portraits only.

1449
01:31:52,306 --> 01:31:54,900
The proceeds and the piss-offs
are both yours to deal with.

1450
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:02,247
11:00 a.m., Paddington Station.

1451
01:32:14,795 --> 01:32:16,626
Gale,

1452
01:32:16,697 --> 01:32:18,858
Michael wants
to see you in the garden.

1453
01:32:18,933 --> 01:32:20,457
- What for?
- I don't know.

1454
01:32:26,774 --> 01:32:28,298
Gale, come.
Come and look at this.

1455
01:32:29,577 --> 01:32:31,340
Come.

1456
01:32:32,847 --> 01:32:35,782
- I want to show you something.
- What's this for?

1457
01:32:38,018 --> 01:32:40,248
It's for you.

1458
01:32:40,321 --> 01:32:42,448
What have I done to deserve this?
What have I done?

1459
01:32:42,523 --> 01:32:45,014
You're a spy
sent to steal from me.

1460
01:32:45,092 --> 01:32:48,653
And nobody steals from Michael X!
No one!

1461
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:54,659
See if it mentions
the copper in charge.

1462
01:32:57,905 --> 01:32:59,668
Here it is.
"Heading the case

1463
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:03,005
is Detective Sergeant Roy Given
of Marylebone Lane Police Station."

1464
01:33:04,845 --> 01:33:06,312
Roy Given.

1465
01:33:07,414 --> 01:33:09,245
No Roy Given mentioned.

1466
01:33:10,317 --> 01:33:11,944
Let's hope that means he's straight.

1467
01:33:12,019 --> 01:33:14,453
And that he'd be interested
in the names of some bent coppers.

1468
01:33:14,521 --> 01:33:16,386
Yeah, bit of a long shot.

1469
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:21,152
- Fuck it.
- Nothing in that one?

1470
01:33:21,228 --> 01:33:22,695
No.

1471
01:33:24,665 --> 01:33:26,462
What, we don't rate a mention?

1472
01:33:26,533 --> 01:33:28,023
Strike you as strange?

1473
01:33:28,102 --> 01:33:29,729
It's kind of scary actually.

1474
01:33:29,803 --> 01:33:32,033
If that news could disappear,
so could we.

1475
01:33:33,340 --> 01:33:35,467
Next stop, Edgeware Road.

1476
01:33:35,542 --> 01:33:37,669
Well, here's to us.

1477
01:33:41,015 --> 01:33:43,142
See you, mate.

1478
01:33:43,217 --> 01:33:45,082
Look after yourself.
Take care.

1479
01:33:46,220 --> 01:33:47,983
Good luck, Kev.

1480
01:33:57,865 --> 01:34:00,493
So where are you headed
if everything goes to plan?

1481
01:34:03,337 --> 01:34:05,362
I'll tell you
if you're coming with me.

1482
01:34:23,657 --> 01:34:26,285
Morning.
I'm looking for a Mr. Roy Given.

1483
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:28,988
- It's very important.
- Roy Given?

1484
01:34:29,063 --> 01:34:30,724
Yeah.

1485
01:34:31,799 --> 01:34:33,892
Yeah, well, can I ask
what it's concerning?

1486
01:34:33,968 --> 01:34:35,526
No, I prefer to tell him myself.

1487
01:34:35,602 --> 01:34:37,729
Look, all I'm saying is
if you're interested

1488
01:34:37,805 --> 01:34:40,365
in the rest of this book of payoffs,
the author's going to be

1489
01:34:40,441 --> 01:34:43,103
at Paddington Station, 11:00 a.m.,
platform one.

1490
01:34:43,177 --> 01:34:46,169
And how exactly did this
come into your possession?

1491
01:34:46,246 --> 01:34:47,873
Next stop, Paddington Station.

1492
01:34:47,948 --> 01:34:50,041
Change here
for the Bakerloo Line.

1493
01:34:50,117 --> 01:34:52,415
Let's hope no one turns up
fashionably late.

1494
01:35:07,768 --> 01:35:09,861
- There's your friend Tim.
- Good luck.

1495
01:35:23,317 --> 01:35:25,217
It's good to see you in one piece.

1496
01:35:25,285 --> 01:35:27,276
You were worried
for your own ass, Tim,

1497
01:35:27,354 --> 01:35:29,015
not for mine.

1498
01:35:37,598 --> 01:35:39,156
You're a prick, Tim.

1499
01:35:39,233 --> 01:35:41,394
You set this whole thing up
from the start, didn't you?

1500
01:35:41,468 --> 01:35:43,060
Come on, you get to be rich,
free and clear.

1501
01:35:43,137 --> 01:35:45,469
Isn't that what you wanted?

1502
01:36:08,729 --> 01:36:10,890
- You stay here with the car.
- Right.

1503
01:36:10,964 --> 01:36:13,831
Oh, bloody kidney stone.

1504
01:36:13,901 --> 01:36:15,391
It's got to pass soon.

1505
01:37:02,683 --> 01:37:05,151
Haven't had this much
excitement since the war.

1506
01:37:05,219 --> 01:37:06,686
We're a little late, milord.

1507
01:37:17,898 --> 01:37:19,365
So where's your mate?

1508
01:37:19,433 --> 01:37:21,526
That's Terry there
by the newsstand.

1509
01:37:27,941 --> 01:37:30,569
Wait. I've seen those two cowboys
before at the girl's flat.

1510
01:37:30,644 --> 01:37:32,942
- It's a trap. They're Ml5.
- Terry!

1511
01:37:33,013 --> 01:37:34,480
Terry!

1512
01:37:43,790 --> 01:37:45,553
- Lord Mountbatten?
- Yes.

1513
01:37:45,626 --> 01:37:47,685
You know the arrangement?
And you agreed

1514
01:37:47,761 --> 01:37:50,321
to our new identities
and immunity from prosecution?

1515
01:37:50,397 --> 01:37:53,025
You have my word that the Crown
will honor this commitment.

1516
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:55,000
Your documentation
and guarantees.

1517
01:37:58,739 --> 01:38:01,003
If I were you I'd keep them
in a very safe place.

1518
01:38:01,074 --> 01:38:03,838
Yeah, well you can bet
it won't be a safe deposit box.

1519
01:38:12,553 --> 01:38:15,283
She is a scallywag.
Thank you.

1520
01:38:21,562 --> 01:38:23,553
Martine...

1521
01:38:23,630 --> 01:38:25,097
it wasn't all business for me.

1522
01:38:30,003 --> 01:38:32,301
- What's happening? Where's the book?
- Just open the door.

1523
01:38:32,372 --> 01:38:33,930
- No!
- Get in there.

1524
01:38:34,007 --> 01:38:35,838
Stay there or you're dead meat.

1525
01:38:40,380 --> 01:38:42,280
Where you going, old man, eh?

1526
01:38:45,419 --> 01:38:47,148
- This one's for Dave.
- No.

1527
01:38:48,322 --> 01:38:50,415
Here, you fucker!

1528
01:38:51,825 --> 01:38:53,452
Not so fucking smug now are you?

1529
01:39:00,500 --> 01:39:02,058
Oi, you sod...

1530
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:42,308
- Eddie, get out.
- That's the bloke that killed Dave.

1531
01:39:42,376 --> 01:39:43,934
Get your hands off me!

1532
01:39:45,112 --> 01:39:46,807
Arrest them.
They're the bank robbers.

1533
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:48,472
- Fuck!
- This bloke killed our friend.

1534
01:39:48,548 --> 01:39:50,573
- Shit.
- We're innocent.

1535
01:40:01,461 --> 01:40:03,156
So are we seriously
assholed now, Terry?

1536
01:40:03,230 --> 01:40:05,721
Well, at least we're not dead
like poor old Dave.

1537
01:40:08,969 --> 01:40:11,733
- Get up, you filthy bastard.
- I want...

1538
01:40:11,805 --> 01:40:13,602
You're under arrest.

1539
01:40:13,674 --> 01:40:15,665
- Take him away.
- Right. Come on you.

1540
01:40:16,743 --> 01:40:18,267
Get in the car.

1541
01:40:23,984 --> 01:40:25,246
I tried, mate.

1542
01:40:33,660 --> 01:40:35,423
I wonder if that's Roy Given.

1543
01:40:38,765 --> 01:40:40,357
Who's he?

1544
01:40:40,434 --> 01:40:43,096
We was hoping
he was a straight copper.

1545
01:40:44,871 --> 01:40:46,736
We've got a nice collar here, Roy.

1546
01:40:46,807 --> 01:40:49,605
You know these two are part
of the Baker Street bank robbery gang?

1547
01:40:49,676 --> 01:40:51,405
- Place this man under arrest.
- Yes, sir.

1548
01:40:51,478 --> 01:40:54,140
What are you talking about?
They're part of the Baker Street firm.

1549
01:40:54,214 --> 01:40:56,239
I don't know about them,
but I know about you,

1550
01:40:56,316 --> 01:40:58,113
you corrupt bastard.
Cuff him...

1551
01:40:58,185 --> 01:41:00,244
and the one over
by the wall as well.

1552
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:02,311
But they're the robbers.

1553
01:41:03,590 --> 01:41:05,114
No robbers in here.

1554
01:41:05,192 --> 01:41:06,819
Watch your head.

1555
01:41:06,893 --> 01:41:08,224
Now...

1556
01:41:08,295 --> 01:41:11,594
I believe you have
a certain Mr. Vogel's book of shame.

1557
01:41:11,665 --> 01:41:14,133
Well, if you'll let me out,
I'll go get it for you.

1558
01:41:18,305 --> 01:41:20,136
That belongs to me.

1559
01:41:26,380 --> 01:41:27,904
There's your book.

1560
01:41:27,981 --> 01:41:30,575
Terry, we were thinking,
a smart fellow like you

1561
01:41:30,650 --> 01:41:32,277
might have kept mementos
of the event just in case.

1562
01:41:32,352 --> 01:41:35,651
In case what?
Things didn't turn out so nicely?

1563
01:41:35,722 --> 01:41:37,417
If they should ever
see the light of day,

1564
01:41:37,491 --> 01:41:38,981
don't think we can't find you.

1565
01:41:46,299 --> 01:41:48,767
Out! Go on, piss off!

1566
01:41:49,836 --> 01:41:51,394
And you, go on.

1567
01:41:51,471 --> 01:41:53,336
- How did that happen?
- Fucked if I know.

1568
01:41:53,407 --> 01:41:55,034
Just keep walking.

1569
01:42:04,918 --> 01:42:06,943
Michael! Michael!

1570
01:42:10,924 --> 01:42:12,414
What's going on?

1571
01:42:12,492 --> 01:42:14,392
What do you want
in my place?

1572
01:42:14,461 --> 01:42:16,452
- What do you want?
- We are placing you under arrest.

1573
01:42:16,530 --> 01:42:17,997
What am I charged with?

1574
01:42:18,064 --> 01:42:20,259
Conspiracy to import drugs
into the United Kingdom.

1575
01:42:20,333 --> 01:42:22,324
Will that do?
But you could still help yourself.

1576
01:42:23,570 --> 01:42:25,299
There's a British national
staying with you,

1577
01:42:25,372 --> 01:42:28,808
- a certain Gale Benson.
- She was here but she's gone on.

1578
01:42:33,513 --> 01:42:35,105
All right.

1579
01:42:45,592 --> 01:42:47,355
Over here, sir.

1580
01:43:06,146 --> 01:43:09,206
Burn the house down. I want
nothing of this place left standing.

1581
01:43:23,897 --> 01:43:26,832
# Those were the days, my friend #

1582
01:43:26,900 --> 01:43:28,765
# We thought they'd never end... #

1583
01:43:28,835 --> 01:43:30,632
- Were you friends of Dave?
- Oh, yeah.

1584
01:43:30,704 --> 01:43:33,502
We knew him
in a professional capacity.

1585
01:43:34,541 --> 01:43:35,906
He was one of our favorites.

1586
01:43:36,943 --> 01:43:38,911
See you later.

1587
01:43:39,980 --> 01:43:41,743
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1588
01:43:41,815 --> 01:43:44,511
So where are you off to, Kev?

1589
01:43:44,584 --> 01:43:46,415
Anywhere you want to go.

1590
01:43:46,486 --> 01:43:48,920
Sorry, I'm doing a solo
from now on.

1591
01:43:50,023 --> 01:43:51,923
Yeah, well it was worth a try.

1592
01:43:52,993 --> 01:43:54,517
Do you want another one?

1593
01:43:54,594 --> 01:43:56,585
Yeah, go on.
One for the road.

1594
01:43:57,631 --> 01:43:58,723
Ta, mate.

1595
01:44:01,935 --> 01:44:03,960
I just wish Dave
could have seen all this.

1596
01:44:04,037 --> 01:44:05,436
Yeah, here's to Dave.

1597
01:44:05,505 --> 01:44:06,938
To Dave.

1598
01:44:15,015 --> 01:44:17,483
What do you want, Martine?

1599
01:44:17,551 --> 01:44:19,883
I'm sorry I've caused you
this upset, Wendy.

1600
01:44:19,953 --> 01:44:21,944
Well, apparently we're rich.

1601
01:44:24,024 --> 01:44:27,323
I know the business is finished,
but are the cars really ours?

1602
01:44:30,797 --> 01:44:32,628
Yeah.

1603
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,764
They're all yours.

1604
01:44:36,836 --> 01:44:38,394
Jessell's been paid off.

1605
01:44:40,273 --> 01:44:43,436
I won't lie to you.
I'd have gone with him.

1606
01:44:44,544 --> 01:44:46,842
And I'd have shut you
out of my mind.

1607
01:44:46,913 --> 01:44:49,006
But he didn't want to know.

1608
01:44:54,521 --> 01:44:56,318
I'm sorry.

1609
01:44:59,392 --> 01:45:01,019
Your wife's talking to Martine.

1610
01:45:01,094 --> 01:45:02,789
I know, Kev.

1611
01:45:02,862 --> 01:45:04,523
I know.

1612
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:08,729
Good luck.

1613
01:45:24,050 --> 01:45:25,540
It was always you, Terry.

1614
01:45:54,914 --> 01:45:56,745
Go, Daddy!

1615
01:45:57,851 --> 01:45:59,819
Oh my God, Terry,
it's a big one.

1616
01:45:59,886 --> 01:46:02,013
Last us a few chips, that one.

1617
01:46:02,088 --> 01:46:04,056
Don't, Mom.

1618
01:46:12,532 --> 01:46:14,124
Fish fingers tonight, eh?

1619
01:47:18,965 --> 01:47:22,924
# I want money #

1620
01:47:23,002 --> 01:47:24,765
# That's what I want #

1621
01:47:26,706 --> 01:47:28,264
# Yeah #

1622
01:47:35,248 --> 01:47:38,809
# The best things in life are free #

1623
01:47:38,885 --> 01:47:42,150
# But you can keep them
for the birds and bees #

1624
01:47:42,222 --> 01:47:45,316
- # Give me money #
- # That's what I want #

1625
01:47:45,391 --> 01:47:49,122
- # That's what I want #

1626
01:47:49,195 --> 01:47:53,689
# That's what I want, yeah #

1627
01:47:53,767 --> 01:47:56,235
# Well, that's what I want #

1628
01:47:57,937 --> 01:48:00,963
# Your loving gives me
such a thrill #

1629
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:04,567
# But your loving
don't pay my bills #

1630
01:48:04,644 --> 01:48:07,943
- # Give me money #
- # That's what I want #

1631
01:48:08,014 --> 01:48:11,711
- # That's what I want #

1632
01:48:11,785 --> 01:48:16,381
# That's what I want #

1633
01:48:16,456 --> 01:48:18,890
# Well, that's what I want #

1634
01:48:20,426 --> 01:48:23,156
# Money don't get everything,
it's true #

1635
01:48:23,229 --> 01:48:26,824
# But what it don't get
I can't use #

1636
01:48:26,900 --> 01:48:30,461
- # Give me money #
- # That's what I want #

1637
01:48:30,537 --> 01:48:34,268
- # That's what I want #

01:48:34,340 --> 01:48:38,003
# That's what I want #

01:48:38,077 --> 01:48:41,513
# Yeah, that's what I want #

1640
01:48:41,581 --> 01:48:45,278
- # Well, give me money #
- # That's what I want #

1641
01:48:45,351 --> 01:48:48,718
- # Lots of money #
- # That's what I want #

1642
01:48:48,788 --> 01:48:52,986
- # A whole lot of money #

1643
01:48:53,059 --> 01:48:56,995
# Give me money
money money money money #

1644
01:48:57,063 --> 01:49:00,965
# Whoa yeah #

1645
01:49:01,034 --> 01:49:04,800
# Well, that's what I want #

1646
01:49:04,871 --> 01:49:08,363
# Yeah yeah yeah. #
