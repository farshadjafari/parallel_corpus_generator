00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,803
(Fireworks boom and crackle)

2
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,763
(Fireworks whistle)

3
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,765
Hi, Mum.

4
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,810
Sorry, I couldn't call sooner.
Haven't had the chance.

5
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,925
No, I'm just walking back to the flat
My shift ran over.

6
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,762
Loads of kids with firework burns.

7
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,323
How's Dad?

8
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,047
What about next weekend?

9
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,401
I could take the train up, stay the night

10
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,364
(Fireworks exploding)

11
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,326
I'll call you on Sunday.
We'll make a plan.

12
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,883
Gotta go now.

13
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,927
OK. Bye.

14
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,809
(Whispering)

15
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,364
Go on, man.

16
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,363
Hey, cut across her.

17
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,251
Oh, fuck.

18
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,961
Give me the phone, give me the phone.
Give me the phone!

19
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,330
The money, the purse.
Give me the purse, give it to me.

20
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,005
Don't fuck about.

21
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,963
Hey. Please.

22
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,564
- Give me that ring.
- It's not worth...

23
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,523
Shut up. Wanna get murked, innit?

24
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,764
- Stupid...
- Get off me!

25
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,084
- Oh!
- Oi, what?

26
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,723
- Boy, you're too brave.
- Quick, fam, 'fore the feds come.

27
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,171
Fuck the feds, man.

28
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,286
Take it.

29
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,564
- Look, man. Look.
- (Shouting)

30
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,726
Fuck!

31
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,330
- Oi, she's duckin'.
- Hey, fam, she's ghostin'.

32
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,446
- Allow it.
- Somebody's bombin' us, blood.

33
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,881
- No, man, it's just a firework.
- Some big firework.

34
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,962
Nice whip.
Could be bare valuables in there.

35
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,811
Raargh!

36
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,524
- Shit. There's something...
- Whoa!

37
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,801
(Screeching and panicked shouting)

38
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,486
(Screeches)

39
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,889
What the fuck was that?

40
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,571
Some orang-utan type thing,
I'm not even lying, bruv.

41
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,444
Hey, it's breezin', man.
It looked like Dobby the house elf.

42
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,881
- Moses got shanked by a Dobby.
- (Laughter)

43
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,560
I'm chasing that down. I'm killing that.

44
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,481
Watch.

45
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,761
- Payback, fam.
- I'm proper stampin' that.

46
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,644
- It's gone in adventure.
- Round two, bruv. Round two.

47
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,523
Playtime, bruv.

48
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,483
(Screeching)

49
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,089
(Excited chatter)

50
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,451
I got my tool.

51
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,131
No man stunting.
I'm gonna fuck this thing up!

52
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,810
Yo, you got beef now, Moses.

53
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,084
- Yo, Pest, got them bangers?
- Yeah.

54
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,724
Jam, man.

55
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,887
(Bang)

56
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,843
(Squealing)

57
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,243
(Further bangs)

58
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,406
(Squealing)

59
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,371
It's mine.

60
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,091
- (Creature screeches)
- Hey, back me! Back me!

61
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,003
(Shouting and screeching)

62
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,042
(Screeching dies down)

63
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,529
- Ah, no, man, that is rank.
- Hey, we broke it up.

64
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,643
- What is that, cuz?
- That ain't no is. That's a was.

65
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,126
I told you, some exotic creature,
like a monkey thing.

66
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,209
That fell out of the sky. You trying to
tell me it's raining monkeys?

67
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,208
That ain't no monkey.
Monkeys ain't bald.

68
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,766
No, that's some weird thing.
I don't know what that is.

69
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,087
- I ain't even gonna say.
- You know what that is?

70
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,044
I'll tell you what that is.
That's a alien, bruv. Believe it.

71
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,765
It must have come from outer space,
trying to take over Earth.

72
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,962
But it landed in the wrong place.

73
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,923
- The wrong place!
- (Laughter)

74
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,770
- Welcome to London, mo fucker.
- Welcome to the ends, brother.

75
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,770
This is the block. And nobody fucks
with the block, do you get me?

76
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,326
The B-L-O-C-K.

77
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,284
ALL: Brap. Brap. Brap. Brap. Brap...

78
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,243
(Brapping)

79
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,963
(Sobbing)

80
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,526
- You all right, love?
- Not really.

81
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,565
- Do you live here?
- Yeah.

82
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,887
- Come along, I'll take you home.
- Thank you.

83
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,809
Come on.

84
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,929
You poor thing.
Pale as a ghost, you were.

85
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,440
Must have given you such a nasty shock.

86
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,609
- You sure you don't want a cup of tea?
- No, thanks. Water's fine.

87
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,967
(Fireworks crackle and boom)

88
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,207
Bloody fireworks.

89
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,531
I think they should ban them.

90
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,769
Could be the third world war out there,
you wouldn't know the difference.

91
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,723
What did the police say?

92
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,364
Said it was one of the busiest nights
of the year. Bet they don't even turn up.

93
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,050
Only it's not like the kids
are scared of 'em no more.

94
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,448
Walking around with knives,
great big dogs, like they own the block.

95
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,326
Excuse my French, but they're
fucking monsters, ain't they?

96
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,647
Yeah. Fucking monsters.

97
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,807
- ..its ribs and that.
- Have you found anything?

98
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,444
(Laughter)

99
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,086
I beg you give me two pound
to go to Chicken World, fam.

100
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,571
That's disgusting.

101
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,523
Moses,
where are we gonna take that thing?

102
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,524
Take it to Ron's. He watches
that National Geographic shit.

103
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,801
- (Mobile rings)
- All man ever does is blaze,

104
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,127
water them big buds
and watch the nature channel.

105
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,289
He'll identify that thing for real.
Let me bell him up.

106
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,045
It was madness, fam.
The beast of Brixton.

107
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,889
We were crazy kicking that.

108
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,281
No, Mum. Playing football.

109
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,891
Yeah, I had pepperoni pizza.
You gave me the money.

110
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,605
Some kind of
non-found-out-about creature.

111
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,404
Yeah, like Some Gears Of War thing.

112
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,166
Yes, I know. Back by ten.
I swear, Mum, back by ten.

113
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,046
Ah, she's a nurse.
They don't get paid nothing, fam.

114
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,084
Oi, Moses. Why you always picking
the poor people, man?

115
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,643
(Laughter)

116
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,723
- Hey, let's walk, bruv.
- Whoo!

117
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,010
Woy.

118
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,651
- Moses, what happened to your face?
- Battled an alien that fell from the sky.

119
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,330
- You're funny.
- Eurgh, what is that?

120
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,964
I'm sorry, I can't even look at that.

121
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,765
- Halloween was last week.
- That ain't real. That's a creation.

122
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,564
- Touch it.
- Shove that thing in my face

123
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,648
and them fangs are going up in your tits.

124
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,604
- Move it from me. Grow up.
- Could be diseased, you get me?

125
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,570
- I don't want no chlamydia.
- (Girls laugh)

126
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,841
So you're telling me
that fell out of the sky?

127
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,281
- Yeah.
- And did that to your face?

128
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,447
- Yeah.
- So, you killed lt?

129
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,241
Yeah.

130
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,441
(Scoffs)

131
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,130
Such a bad breed, Moses.

132
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,763
- Fuck! It's alive!
- (Screaming)

133
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,921
- Tia is moving to you, Moses.
- She's on your balls, cuz.

134
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,361
Hey, that's my cousin
you're chatting about.

135
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,687
- Hey, man.
- Hey, hey, hey, watch this jump.

136
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,290
Get down, man.

137
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,681
- Trust, I can do it.
- Humpty-Dumpty.

138
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,291
We ain't cleanin' your guts off the floor,
Biggz. Come on.

139
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,648
- Oh, I swear I could do that.
- Yeah, yeah, sure you can, man.

140
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,566
- Oi, Gavin, you pyro.
- My name ain't Gavin.

141
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,404
It's Mayhem and he's Probs.

142
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,125
- (Laughter)
- Probs and Mayhem? Seriously?

143
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,640
- Urgh, what is that?
- That's none of your business.

144
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,126
That's sick, man.

145
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,969
Where you going?
Let us come with you.

146
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,765
Yeah, Moses, let us roll with you.
We're bad boys.

147
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,810
Go away. This is big man business.
You're too tiny.

148
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,366
Yeah, get in touch
when you get your first pube.

149
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,640
Go suck your mum.

150
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,808
- Oooh!
- Whoo!

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,803

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,124
Yeah, just on my way to the cinema.

what they were wearing?

One of them had one of those
woolly hats with those tassels.

00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,882
<i>had a black baseball cap</i>
<i>with a red brim.</i>

171
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,929
<i>That's all l can remember.</i>

172
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,850
<i>Did you see their faces?</i>
<i>Have you seen them around?</i>

173
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,882
<i>No. They had hoods and scarves.</i>

174
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,649
WOMAN: You want me to call the police?

175
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,331
The best thing is to come with us
for a drive around the block,

176
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,930
see if we can spot them.

177
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,962
Then we can drop you
with a friend afterwards.

178
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,331
No, thanks.

179
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,364
I'm not gonna be scared out my own home
by a bunch of bloody teenagers.

180
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,970
(Door buzzer)

181
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,729
Yo, Ron!

182
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,288
(Presses buzzer) Yo, Ron!

183
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,441
All right?

184
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,763
No idea. Not a bloody clue.

185
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:18,761
Maybe there was a party at the zoo
and a monkey fucked a fish.

186
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,203
I saw them with it on the way up.

187
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,006
- Thought they'd won it at the funfair.
- Smells real though, don't it?

188
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,963
Smells like a shit did a shit.

189
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,571
- You wanna buy a bit of weed, then?
- Yeah.

190
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,046
- Yeah, come on.
- (Chatter)

191
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,048
Shut up, man.

192
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,366
Well done, lads.

193
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,051
You've discovered a species
hitherto unknown to science,

194
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:49,369
quite possibly non-terrestrial in origin,
and you kicked its fucking head in.

195
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,010
(Laughter)

196
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,047
- Take a seat. I'll be back in a minute.
- Yeah.

197
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,050
We're getting rich off that, you know,
cos we discovered it.

198
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,407
- eBay, fam.
- Alert the media.

199
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,283
Exclusive rights to the highest bidder.

200
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,049
The Sun. Believes anything.

201
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,163
No, no, no, no, no. The Sun'll dress it up
like one of them Page Three girls.

202
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,804
You wanna call The Guardian, blood.

203
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,049
- People will believe it in a proper paper.
- No, tabloids pay more money.

204
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,282
You can't call the paper.
FBI will confiscate it.

205
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,403
FBI? This is England, there ain't no FBI.

206
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,363
It's Section Six or something.

207
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,449
- We need an expert to verify that thing.
- Look in the Yellow Pages.

208
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,802
Look for scientist people who know
about all them meteor things.

209
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,161
Yellow Pages?
Like, what, "A" for aliens?

210
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,810
- Cheers.
- We need a lawyer,

211
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,285
a manager or something.

212
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,402
Bell Simon Cowell. Alien's Got Talent.

213
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,805
(Laughter)

214
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,005
Jokes, man, jokes.

215
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,844
Actually, I did this zoology module at uni.

216
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,446
Primatology, mammalogy, all that shizzle.

217
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,485
That thing in there don't belong
to no taxon I've ever studied.

218
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,091
You met Brewis, then?
Very reliable customer.

219
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,003
- Gwanin'.
- (Laughter)

220
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,329
Hey, move, blood! (Tuts)

221
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,922
- (Laughter continues)
- Hey, hey!

222
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,606
Allow it, allow it, allow it...

223
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,491
- Yo, Ron.
- You want a bourbon?

224
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,047
Let me keep that thing in the weed room.
Could be worth bare money.

225
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,082
That's the safest place in the block.

226
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,160
Look, I'd love to, but it's not my decision.
I only work here.

227
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,123
Why don't you come and ask the boss?

228
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,601
- What, Hi-Hatz is here?
- Yeah, he's in the weed room.

229
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,563

Ah, check it out, he's got a puppet.

240
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,649
You made that in college or something?

241
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,606
You got mad skills for puppets.

242
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,642
Looks proper rotten and everything.

243
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,808
Found it over the park,
didn't you, Moses?

244
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,524
He wants to know if he can keep it here.

245
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,164
He reckons it's worth bare money.

246

Oi, come on.

Yes, fam.

- He got recruited, innit.

278

279
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,167

Yo, check it.

- More.

285
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,083
- More what?
- Them tings.

286
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,451
It's just rockets, innit?

287
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,486
Nah. Rockets go up
before they come down.

288
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,682
Them things are pure comin' down.

289
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,604
- They're the same.
- Same as what?

290
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,563
- As what hit that car before, fam.
- Trust.

291
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,489
Nah. More of them nasty little gremlins.

292
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,046
- It's raining Gollums.
- Bare creatures.

293
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,645
Hey, that one landed in the park, fam, close.

294
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,809

- Nah, mate, it's a alien invasion.

295

- Let's get down there, cuz.

296
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,965
- Let's go fuck them up!
- I'm killin' them straight

297
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,970
- Ay, let's get tooled up, blood.
- Come, come.

298
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,764
Ay, somebody call pest control?

300
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,041
Quite sweet really, aren't they?

301
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,731
- Hi.
- Emergency situation! Move, move!

302
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,650
- Don't shove us!
- Some of us have got exams tomorrow!

303
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,605
(Shouting)

304
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,331
- Where have you been?
- Got to get the puncture repair kit.

305
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,523
- Why? You're not going out again.
- Just to mend my tyre. Ten minutes.

306
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,086
- Hey. Ten minutes, I mean it.
- I promise.

307
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,605
What happened to your leg?

308
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,007
Nothing, Nan.
I pulled a muscle playing football.

309
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,885
- Back in a bit, Nan.
- Now, don't you go getting into trouble.

310
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,843
Course not, Nan.

311
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,724
- Dennis, where are you going?
- Out!

312
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,888
- Then take your dog.
- No, man, I'm busy.

313
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,127
- I'm not asking, I'm telling.
- (Sighs)

314
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,449
Pogo. Come, come, come.
Come, let's go savage some Gollums.

315
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,523
(Whooping)

316
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,363
Whoa! Let's go!

317
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,845
Go, go, go!

318
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,089
Hey, Moses, what's happening?
Wait for us.

319
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,647
Wait. It's not fair, man.
We wanna come too.

320
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,450
Hey, what, the Dobbies came again.

321
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,006
- There might be something in it.
- Set the grass on fire.

322
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,650
- Messed up, man.
- I told you, fam.

323
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,286
- A meteor, for real.
- Ay, loads came down, innit.

324
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,448
We gotta take them all out.
Gotta catch them all.

325
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,528
Calm down, Biggz, this ain't Pokémon.

326
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,250
Yo, shine the light.

327
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,209
- Like a fossil, innit.
- No, that's different.

328
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,765
That ain't even the same thing.

329
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,484
That looks triple the size, blood.

330
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,323
I'd like to see the brother who'd fight that.

331
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,246
Right now, I feel like going home,
locking my door and playing FIFA.

332
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,282
(Screeching)

333
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,089
Hey, what was that?

334
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,361
- Pogo. Pogo, whoa. Stay.
- (Barks)

335
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,481
Stay.

336
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,686
- There.
- Holy fuck.

337
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,649

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,131
- They say aliens?
- That's what I heard, man.

00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,083

00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,884
Look, man.

353

Shit, man!

354
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,603
Hey, come on, Biggz, man.

355
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,204

356
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,769
Bully van!

357
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,367

You do not have to say anything...
(Continues with caution)

366
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,966
Victim's mobile phone.

367
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,884
Anything you do say may be given in evidence.
Do you understand?

368

376
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,563
(They gasp)

377
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,841
Control, re Ballard Street.

Throw it off, man! Throw it off!

Yo, Biggz,

(Approaching police siren)

407
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,408
Ron, it's Brewis.

408
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,525
Mate, someone's like petrol-bombed

And there's po-po everywhere.

410
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,646
<i>- I need to come back up.</i>
- All right, calm down.

411
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,889
I've got the binoculars out.
Where are ya?

412
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,730
I'm by the road by the park.
Behind a bush.

413
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,649
<i>What can you see?</i>

414
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:16,288
Couple of fire engines parked up
by the off-licence, and I think...

415
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,846
<i>- Hang on. Fuck me.</i>

00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,131

417
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,448
- Right. No police, though?
<i>- No, you're all right.</i>

418
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,966
Come back up. Not a blue light in sight.

419
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,124
(Rap music from car stereo)

420
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,965
Whoa!

421

00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,888
Oh, shit, shit, shit.

00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,890
This is a bad dream.
Tell me I'm dreaming.

424
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,730
Let me out! Open the door!

425
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,724
Wait, blood, wait, blood.

426
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:08,003
That ain't even police at the wheel,
that's youths in there.

427
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,641
- What we gonna do, bruv?
- Give me the strap.

428
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,243
Let me out! Open the door!

429
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,203
Open the door!

430
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,886
Sorry about the driving.
I'll get lessons for Christmas.

431
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,571
- What were those things?
- We're thinking probably aliens.

432
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,444
- You should leave.
- Before the situation gets more nuts.

433
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,246
Go on, then.

434
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,402
Ain't you gonna thank us
for saving your life?

435
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,400
My fucking hero.

436
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,761
- Yo, Hi-Hatz, it was a accident.
- Nah, trust, bruv.

437
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,689
There's bare creatures chasing us.

438
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,166
Big alien-gorilla-wolf motherfuckers.
I swear.

439
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,841
Some creature fell from outer space
and jumped Moses, so he bored it.

440
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,247
And now its brethren
have come down in force, blood.

441
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,886
Moses got shiffed by the feds
and the things attacked the van

442
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,968
and savaged the bluefoot,
so we jacked the van.

443
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,606
We're running for our lives now, cuz.
Believe!

444
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:21,044
Jack a bully van, crash it into my whip
and then chat shit about aliens to me?

445
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,761
This is making me nervous, blood.
That boy's still cuffed, you know.

446
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,485
- Police are gonna be all over this.
- You trying to snake me?

447
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,082
What, you wanna bring arms to me now?
You wanna murk me?

448
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:42,083
- You wanna war with me?
- Listen to me, cuz, I'm not even lying.

449
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,360
If we was making it up,

450
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,971
don't you think we'd make up
something better than aliens?

451
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,684
Say that word one more time.

452
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,563
(Distant screeching)

453
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,365
I told you, bruv.
On the roof, if you don't believe me.

454
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,885
What? What's on the roof?

455
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,331
- One of them...
- Say it!

456
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,364
One of them big
gorilla-wolf motherfuckers.

457
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,323
(Screeching)

458
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,847
Yo, Hi-Hatz, there is something there, bruv.

459
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,931
Yo, go see what that is.

460
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,883
- No way, bruv.
- Move!

461
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,404
Shit.

462
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,451
Yo, Hi-Hatz, bruv.

463
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,323
- There's no...
- Oh, shit!

464
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,123
(Screeching and chomping)

465
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,929
Oh, shit!

466
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,088
- Got the key to your lockup?
- Yeah.

467
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,527
- Follow me, follow me!
- (Panicked shouting)

468
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,808
Moses! Pussyhole!

469
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,922
I'm gonna get you killed, blood! Watch!

470
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,883
(Screeching)

471
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,169
I told you, man. Alien invasion.

472
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,521
London-wide. For real.
I knew it from the start.

473
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,011
Them vans got tracker beacons.

474
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,168
- Police will be here any minute.
- We're fucked.

475
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,567
When the feds find the bodies
and the van, we are fucked.

476
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,241
No. If it's happening all over, the police
are gonna be too busy tonight.

477
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,760
National emergency,
army on the streets, helicopters,

478
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,450
all that 28 Days Later shit.

479
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,128
We need to get off the streets.
Back in the block.

480
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,685
Like none of this ever happened.

481
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,449
Yes, boss. Back in the block!

482
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,403
How do we do that
with them things out there?

483
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,044
That's suicide, man.

484
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,009
- You know what?
- What?

485
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,407
I'm shitting myself, innit.
But at the same time...

486
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,126
What?

487
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,764
This is sick.

488
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,164

489
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,762

493
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,721
(Screeches)

494
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,608
Stairs, blood!

495
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,529
Move, move, move, move!

496
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,289
Where's Biggz?

498
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,930
Go on, run!

Close the door, man!

500
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,850
Fuck!

503
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,563
Aarghh!

504
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,008
(Splintering of wood)

505
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,889
(Boys shouting)

506
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,211
Hey, snitch!

507
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,970
Move, man! Huh? Move!

508
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,331
Fucking move!

509
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,361
- Hey, come on, blood!
- Get the bag off him!

510
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,410
- Somebody bell Biggz. Where's Biggz?
- I got one text left.

511
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,602
- I got no credit.
- Drop call everybody.

512
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:49,326
- Pray someone calls back.
- This is too much to explain in one text.

513
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,443
Get out of my fucking flat!

514
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,962
- Shut up, man.
- Pss...

515
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,765
- I said, get out!
- Yo, snitch, calm yourself.

516
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,290
This ain't about you no more.

517
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,767
Come anywhere near me and I swear
I will scream this fucking block down!

518
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,201
There's worse things out there
than us tonight.

519
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,561
Hey, bruv. I saw her ID card thingy.

520
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,444
- She's a nurse, innit.
- Help me, then. I need this leg.

521
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,642
I need it to be able to run away
from them things.

522
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,364
You think I'm gonna help you?

523
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,847
After you attacked me, and robbed me,
and then set those dogs on the police?

524
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,451
- Yes to the first two, no to the last one.
- Dogs?

525
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,006
Dogs with glow-in-the-dark jaws?
Dogs with no eyes?

526
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,486
Dogs the size of gorillas?
D'you think they're dogs?

527
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,763
Go out there and try feedin' 'em
some Pedigree Chum. They're aliens.

528
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,088
Whatever the fuck they are,
they're not fucking aliens.

529
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,329
- You swear too much, man.
- Yeah, you got a potty mouth, man.

530
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,607
Whatever they are,
they're inside the block.

531
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,290
They're after everyone.

532
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,369
Yeah, we're on the same side now.
You get me?

533
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,249
- No feds.
- You'd be better off calling the Ghostbusters.

534
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,329
This is the block. We take care of things
our own way. Get me?

535
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,567
- You're joking?
- Does it look like he's jokin'?

536
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,207
I was gonna call for help.
Your friend needs to go to hospital.

537
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,130
So do you. If those wounds get infected,
they could kill you.

538
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,050
- Nah, he likes his scars, innit.
- Fuck!

539
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,730
He's bleedin' to death! Help him!

540
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,569
We ain't gonna do nothing.

541
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,844
Fix him.

542
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,520
Jesus.

543
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,563
(Both exhale)

544
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:42,006
TV: <i>It's one of me most extraodinary</i>
<i>spectacles in nature.</i>

545
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,923
What if those kids were right?

546
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,087
What if they're connected -
that freak show animal

547
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,451
and the hole in my dad's car?

548
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,927
What if there is some kind of invasion
and the police are out there?

549
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,767
I can't get busted again.

550
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,928
- You've been busted?
- Yeah.

551
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,130
Left half an oz in my jeans, put them in
the washing machine by mistake and...

552
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,960
I shit you not, my mum's underwear
came out stinking of skunk.

553
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,449
My dad obviously caught a whiff
and cut off my allowance.

554
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,523
Next time, it'll be my testiklees.

555
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,767
Yeah, it's tough times for you, mate.

556
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,763
The irony is, now I've gotta sell
twice the amount just to pay the rent.

557
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,484
I thought you said you lived at home?

558
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,929
Yeah, well, I mean...
I mean "rent" in the proverbial sense.

559
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,089
Oh, yeah. Well, you gotta do
what you gotta do, you know.

560
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,966
A man's gotta put bread on the table -
proverbially speaking, of course.

561
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,525
Fo-shizzle.

562
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,086
Listen, even if it is an alien invasion,

563
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,162
they're four foot high, they're blind

564
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,965
and they got kicked to death
by a group of kids.

565
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,765
- We got nothing to worry about.
- Yeah.

566
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,285
- All right?
- (Laughs) Yeah.

567
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,162
Sorry I messed up your couch.

568
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,406
- Don't worry about it.
- D'you want me to take 'em off?

569
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,611
That won't be necessary.

570
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,722
You sure? I got nice boxers on.

571
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,084
Genuine Calvin Klein. Fresh today.

572
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,161
- Tell me if this hurts.
- Try me.

573
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,121
Ow! Hurts.

574
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,770
- How about this?
- Hurts, hurts, hurts, hurts, hurts!

575
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,280
You've torn a few minor arteries.
You might have a fracture.

576
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,607
This needs treating
before you lose too much blood.

577
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,449
- Do it, then.
- I can't do it.

578
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,847
I don't have the equipment or the skill.

579
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,325
I've only just graduated.

580
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,601
And I missed the class
on alien bite wounds.

581
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,085
Stop hyping, man.

582
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,088
Pass me that cushion.

583
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,929
I said, pass me that cushion!

584
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,007
(Tuts)

585
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,769
Oh! Don't take it out on me.

586
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,408
I ain't seen you around here before,
you know.

587
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,563
- You lived here long?
- Couple of months.

588
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,682
Hmm. Nice place you got.

589
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,451
Thanks. Thinking of moving.

590
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,448
Shame. Why?

591
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,563
- I don't like the area.
- What do you mean, don't like the area?

592
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,011
What's wrong with the area?

593
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,367
(Heavy thud on door)

594
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,970
Fam, stay.

595
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,166
(Screeches)

596
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,564
Get off me!

597
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,769
- What was that?
- They found us.

598
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,009
How could they find us?
There's, like, 160 doors in this block.

599
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,123
Whatever gang war you're involved in,
leave me out of it, please.

600
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,810
(Heavy thud)

601
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,968
Hey, this ain't got nothin'
to do with gangs.

602
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,163
Or drugs. Or rap music.
Or violence in video games.

603
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,249
- This is the worst night of my life.
- Feeling's mutual.

604
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,966
- (Warrior cry)
- Moses, don't, man!

605
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,850
Moses.

606
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,405
Ninja!

607
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,090
Tango neutralised.

608
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,488
See? Is that a dog?

609
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,646
- No.
- No, that is not a dog.

610
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,209
That's black.

611
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,685
Too black to see.

612
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,644
That's the blackest black ever, fam.

613
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,730
That's blacker than my cousin Femi.

614
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,962
Oi, where's that woman?

615
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,048
(Distant screeching)

616
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,883
(Screeching intensifies)

617
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,130
Wherever you're going,
I'm coming with you.

618
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,004
After what you put me through tonight,
it's the least you can do.

619
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,566
No way, man.
She's bare annoyin'.

620
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,331
Make her leave.
Let that snitch get murked.

621
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,408
Dennis, why you acting like such a prick?

622
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,408
I need the nurse.
Do you want me to die?

623
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,284
We can't stand around here arguing.
We need to roll. Now!

624
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,644
- My name's Sam.
- Jerome.

625
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,364
- I'm Pest.
- No, man.

626
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,401
Dennis.

627
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,605
You're Moses, right?

628
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,685
You're gonna need a weapon.

629
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,402
OFFICER: Move along, please. Move along.

630
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,324
Yo, bring it, bring it, bring it.

631
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,611
Bring it, bring it, bring it.
Yo, bring the thing, blood.

632
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,001
- What's happening, man?
- Something fucked up.

633
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:41,328
Hi-Hatz, bruv, there's bare feds in the area,
roadblocks and everything.

634
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,522
Maybe we should chill out
till things die down.

635
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:46,450
- Are you telling me to chill out?
- No. Wait till things cool down.

636
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,847
- You telling me to cool down?
- Ah, forget it, bruv.

637
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,522
Get in the car.

638
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,326
Get in the car now!

639
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,847
They mash up my whip
with a bully van they stole,

640
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,121
start threatening me about aliens
or some shit,

641
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,090
facing me down,
telling me I'm gonna get shifted.

642
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,407
Hey, watch where you're going,
you prick!

643
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:12,809
Then, some like...some like big dog,
some big gorilla wolf motherfucker,

644
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:17,129
comes down from the roof, rolls Tonks,
tears his neck all the way out. Believe.

645
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,171
- So was it a dog, then?
- Don't give a fuck what it was.

646
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,089
Shot that ting. Died easy.

647
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,240
And we gotta learn them youngers
tonight, you get me?

648
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,044
That's my block!

649
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,844

(Tyres screech)

655
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,365
You get four years for carrying
an offensive weapon, you know.

656
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,404
- I think this situation's a bit different.
- Is it?

657
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:09,649
Walking around,
expecting to get jumped at any moment?

658
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,648
Feels like just another day in the ends to me.

659
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,286
- Where's he taking us?
- Tia's flat.

660
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:17,927
- How will we be any safer in her place?
- Security gate.

661
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:21,851
She wouldn't be asking that question
if she'd seen them girls fight.

663

<i>- Yo, Biggz, we thought you was dead.</i>
- I called you 50 times, blood.

665
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,769
What's your phone doing on silent
at a time like this for, fam?

666
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,131
<i>- Where you at?</i>
- In the bin.

667
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,164
Same bin I was at that time
them boys from Aylesbury was after me.

668

(Thudding)

669
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:45,330
One of them things is trying to headbang
me out. Rescue me, yeah?

670
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:48,921
Ain't that simple, bruv. Them things
are in the block, busting through doors.

671
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,970
You're the only one with credit.
Call everyone, spread the word.

672
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,525
Tell them to stay inside. Get me?

673
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,602
<i>I'll bell you back when we get to Tia's.</i>

674
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,845
Fuck this, man!

675
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,609
(Rings)

676
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,051
- Yo, Biggz.
<i>- Listen, listen.</i>

677
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:07,527
<i>I've got one pound credit and bare people</i>
<i>to call. I can only say this once.</i>

678
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,164
<i>We need backup. Alien attack.</i>

679
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,602
Slow down. I don't understand
a word you're saying. Speak slowly.

680
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,768
<i>This ain't no time to be speaking slowly!</i>

681
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,724
<i>Moses and Dennis are heading to Tia's.</i>
<i>Call everyone!</i>

682
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,610
<i>Tell them to come back!</i>
<i>That thing we killed was for real!</i>

683
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,682
<i>Now there's bigger ones battering me...</i>

684
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,371
Phone me later
when you ain't playing Xbox.

685
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,647
Check it. Reginald and Gavin survived.

686
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,968
Don't answer those names no more.
It's Probs and Mayhem.

687
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,650
Fam, we saw the aliens.

688
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,648
They ran past us, straight.

689
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,364
We got tools.

690
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,289
(Laughter)

691
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:49,210
- Let us roll with you, man.
- That's not real, is it?

692
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,011
- Jesus, he looks about six
- I'm nine and a half.

693
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:55,442
- That ain't a toy, Gavin. Give me that.
- Hey, leave it!

694
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,969
(All talk at once)

695
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,889
Hey. Hey, let go, fam. Oi, let go.

696
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,241
Yo, Reginald, Gavin!

697
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:06,050
Go home, lock your door.
Do your homework. Watch Naruto.

698
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:07,923
Just stay inside tonight, get me?

699
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,363
That's my cousin's!
I gotta give it back!

700
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,687
Stop bitching,
You got a Super Soaker still.

701
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,166
You really think they'll die
if you shoot water at them?

702
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,885
Ain't water in it. Is it?

703
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,486
You ain't bringing all them in here. No.
They're involved in something.

704
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:27,000
Someone's chasing 'em.
They got weapons.

705
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,804
And, look, that one's bleedin'.

706
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,769
And that woman, I don't even know her.

707
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,043
I'm not getting myself involved in
a situation I don't need to be in.

708
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,529
It's my house, Dimples.

709
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:37,686
Come.

710
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,042
Get off me, man.

711
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,163
(Helicopter whirs, sirens blare)

712
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:52,321
There's only one helicopter out there.
Copper chopper.

713
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:55,569
Ain't even military.
And it's only around these ends.

714
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,126
This ain't London-wide.
This is localised.

715
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,482
- Yeah, localised in your head.
- Localised in your dreams.

716
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,443
Drapsed by the feds? Yes.

717
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:06,643
Big gorilla-alien-wolf monsters
killing everyone? Uh-uh.

718
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,842
- Maybe they only fell on these ends.
- Please!

719
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,089
What kind of alien, out of all the places
in the whole wide world,

720
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:14,771
would invade some shitty council estate
in South London?

721
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,805
- One that's looking for a fight.
- They're coming for us. Ready or not.

722
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,446
♪ Ready or not, here I come

723
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,881
♪ You can't hide
- Excuse me.

724
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,331
♪ They're gonna find you

725
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,124
Listen to me!

726
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,248
There's a dead one
in my living room.

727
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:33,290
I live on the first floor.
Go and look if you don't believe me.

728
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:36,164
You can walk right in.
There's no front door any more.

729
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,170
Moses, when did you start going out
with your maths teacher?

730
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,565
(Laughter)

731
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,687
- How d'you know that woman?
- We met earlier.

732
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,171
He mugged me.

733
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,204
- Whey! For real?
- That part I believe.

734
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,607
That true? You rob that woman?

735
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,201
Yeah. But afterwards she fixed my leg
and we saved her from the monster.

736
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,288
So...we're mates now and it's all sweet.

737
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:59,127
- We're heroes, innit?
- Heroes?

738
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,770
Five of you and a knife
against one woman? Fuck off!

739
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,290
Raah. Cold.

740
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:07,051
Nah, nah, nah, don't build it up, luv.
It weren't all that.

741
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:10,129
- We never even touched you.
- The blade was to get it over with quick.

742
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,083
- We was as scared as you.
- Blade?

743
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:16,242
You're such a waste.
Why's it always trouble with you?

744
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:19,523
Why's it always someone gettin' robbed
or beaten up or gettin' arrested?

745
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:22,291
We can't deal with this on our own.
We have to call the police.

746
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,964
You can trust me.
I'll tell them what really happened.

747
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,570
Think the police will help them?

748
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,887
They might not arrest you,
but they'll arrest them.

749
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,641
For the murder of two police officers,
vehicle theft, resisting arrest -

750
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,365
everything that happened
everywhere in the ends tonight.

751
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,164
They arrest us for nothing already.

752
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,928
You know what I reckon, yeah?

753
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:44,281
I reckon the feds sent them, anyway.

754
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:47,130
Government probably bred
those creatures to kill black boys.

755
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,403
First they sent drugs to the ends,
then they sent guns.

756
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,963
Now they sent monsters to get us.

757
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,923
They don't care, man.

758
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,803
We ain't killin' each other fast enough,

759
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,729
so they decided
to speed up the process.

760
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,042
- Believe.
- (Girls laugh)

761
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,487
Pest, I told you not to do that!
Do it out the window, yeah?

762
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,249
It's pain relief. Ask the nurse.

763
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:16,087
Excuse me, but what is that?

764
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,568
- Oh, my days!
- (Screaming)

765
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,122
- You can't take two, fam.
- Watch me.

766
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,842
(Caps bang)

767
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,281
Shit. It is a toy!

768
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,251
(Screaming)

769
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,206
Help! Hey, Moses!

770
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:51,647
Dennis!

771
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,205
(Screaming)

772
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,244
(Screaming)

773
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,284
(Snarls)

774
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,680
- Moses.
- It's coming for you, Moses!

775
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,450
Oi, you fucker!

776
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,608
Tia, what you doing?

777
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,241
Back!

778
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,765
Bash it! Kill it! Kill it!

779
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,723
- Don't stop!
- Harder! Cut him!

780
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,163
Kill him! Harder!

781
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,924
Oh, shit!

782
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,484
(Breath wheezes)

783
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:14,363
Yo, youngers, wagwan?

784
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,811
- Nothing much.
- All right.

785
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,842
Nice weapons. Who you fightin'?

786
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,928
- Aliens.
- Is it?

787
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,167
- Seen that yout Moses lately?
- Who wants to know?

788
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,761
He called us for backup.
Help him fight the aliens off.

789
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,086
Bang! Bang! Bang!

790
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,724
So, where's he at?

791
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,323
(Sobbing)

792
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:46,046
You know that little one
you killed before?

793
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,605
That was a mistake.

794
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:50,291
They weren't going for us.
They were going for you.

795
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,641
Actions have consequences, you know.

796
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,762
Everywhere you go, bad things happen.

797
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,687
TIA: Stay away from us, Moses.

798
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,683
(Alien screeches)

799
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,404
You should leave.
I don't want no one else to die.

800
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,649
- Fuck that, bruv. I got your back.
- I ain't going nowhere.

801
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:24,082
They took Dennis.
We gotta kill all them things, bruv.

802
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,091
Come on!

803
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:34,169
Come on!

804
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,164
Easy kill.

805
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,523
Run, man! Come on!

806
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:51,404
- What are you waiting for?
- Shit!

807
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,124
Open the door! Go!

808
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:56,603
(Screaming and gunshots)

809
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,644
<i>Wagwan, it's young Den.</i>
<i>If it's girls, leave a message.</i>

810
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,364
<i>Mandem, I'm on the block, innit.</i>

811
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,243
Dennis, fam, I made bare calls.

812
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,250
Everyone's come down to back us,
blood, but no one can get inside.

813
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,362
Feds have the block on lockdown.

814
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,085
<i>You've got one minute remaining.</i>

815
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:22,329
I ain't got much credit.
And I can't be in this bin much longer.

816
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,850
I need to make a break for it.

817
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,528
I'll see you at the other side, yeah?

818
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,924
Aargh!

819
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,489
Hey, what the fuck, man!

820
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,807
Why won't someone flippin' rescue me?

821
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:51,043
(Panicked shouting)

822
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,083
(Singing to himself)

823
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,485
(Lift bell)

824
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,691
Better get the next one, blood.

825
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,404
(Lift bell)

826
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,123
(Door closes)

827
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,243
(Lift clunks)

828
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:12,851
(Muffled shouting)

829
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,803
Go, man!

830
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:20,041
- Who was that?
- That's Hi-Hatz.

831
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:22,321
- Man's a sausage.
- Why is he shooting at us?

832
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,442
His best friend got ate
and he's a bit vexed.

833
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,289
(Thud and alien screeching)

834
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,209
I know exactly how he feels.

835
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,811
Would someone please tell me
what the fuck is going on?

836
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,362
What's chasing you? Why is
the other lift full of bits of dead people?

837
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,890
What? We need to go down.

838
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:39,561
I ain't going down. There's too many
things down there out to get me.

839
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:43,969
True say. Bare police, crazy gangsters
and fucked-up monsters down there.

840
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,685
OK. Good. Let's not go down.
Where can we go?

841
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:49,849
- We're going to Ron's weed room.
- What's Ron's weed room?

842
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:52,611
It's a big room full of weed.
And it's Ron's. It's good.

843
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,927
- It's like Fort fucking Knox up there.
- Plan.

844
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,166
19.

845
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:01,125
Bravo Team, on me, on me. Hold positions.

846
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:07,606
(Groans) This is long, man. They've all gone.

847
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,881
No, they ain't. Check it.

848
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,923
(Lift bell)

849
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,126
- Down the end.
- Raah.

850
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:44,808
I am too high for this shit.

851
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:46,805
Trust.

852
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:52,731
- I wanna shoot those things, man.
- Same here, bruv.

853
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:55,570
- Times three.
- Done now.

854
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:13,483
(Aliens screeching)

855
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,806
(Fireworks whistling and exploding)

856
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:23,890
- Bangers, man, bangers!
- I'm Brewis, by the way.

857
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,729
- Sam.
- Front pocket, man.

858
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,007
I'm meant to be at a party in Fulham.
Now I'm trapped in this bloody block.

859
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:33,249
Yo, Pest. Get ready with that lighter.
Yeah, pass it, pass it.

860
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,282
- What about you?
- I live here.

861
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,605
Really?

862
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:38,926
Wicked.

863
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,724
I'm set.

864
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,163
(Firework explosions die down)

865
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:58,327
Lights. Stay close.

866
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:01,327
Go. Go, go.

867
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:10,569
JEROME: Hurry up, man. Keep moving.
BREWIS: Wait for me.

868
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:17,643
PEST: Fire in the hole.

869
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:30,128
JEROME: Get the fuck off me, man.

870
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:33,967
Jesus. There's one behind us. Run!

871
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:44,170
Jerome, where are you, man?

872
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:49,444
(Alien screeches)

873
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,970
Jerome!

874
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,721
(Screeching)

875
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:57,485
MOSES: Jerome! Where you at?

876
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,124
Jerome!

877
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,804
PEST:Jerome?
- (Alien screeches)

878
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:10,002
I can't see shit, man!
Come on, come on. Come on.

879
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,923
Pest? Moses?

880
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,363
Pest! Moses!

881
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:19,250
- Aaarghh!
- Jerome, where you at?

882
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:22,170
- Oi, lights, man, lights!
- Trying to find 'em, man.

883
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,848
I'm going back. Stay by the lights.

884
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:30,160
MOSES: Are you there, man?

885
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,843
They're coming up the stairs, quick.

886
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,450
Jerome?

887
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,160
Help! Help!

888
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,168
- Aargh!
- Follow me!

889
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,771
They got Jerome. Moses!

890
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:53,724
They took him!
They took Jerome!

891
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:58,208
- Man!
- Oh!

892
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,448
What the fuck was that for?

893
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:07,162
Moses, blood!
Come on, man, they'll kill you!

894
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:11,205
Moses!

895
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:14,130
(Screeching)

896
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:22,523
- Yo, Ron! Ron!
- Ron, man, let us in!

897
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:23,925
- Ron!
- Open the door, man!

898
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:26,281
- Hey, let us in, man!
- Hey, open the door!

899
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:28,607
- All right?
- We need to hide in your weed room.

900
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,842
It's the only safe place left in the block.

901
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,763
I don't know about that.

902
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,608
- Ah, come on! Hurry up!
- All right, all right.

903
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,005
Come on.

904
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,207
Wagwan, Moses?

905
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:45,080
Sorry.

906
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,329
(Screeching)

907
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:54,810
- You killed that thing.
- Hi-Hatz, bruv...

908
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:58,287
- You brought it in the ends.
- I don't want no trouble.

909
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:00,049
You brought fed in the ends.

910
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:02,128
Listen to me, bruv.

911
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:06,324
You brought an alien invasion
to the ends.

912
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,361
Shit.

913
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:09,845
Behind you, bruv.

914
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,723
- Don't chat me.
- I'm not even lyin'..

915
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,444
Shut up!

916
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:15,084
I was gonna make you.

917
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:17,691
Now...I'm gonna dead you.

918
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:20,402
This is my block. Get me?

919
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:24,651
Not really.

920
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,085
(Screeching)

921
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,323
(Shouting)

922
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:46,280
(Splat)

923
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,563
(Screeching)

924
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,441
Wish I'd never chased after that thing.

925
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:10,048
Wish we never murked you.

926
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:14,280
I wish I never took that white off Hi-Hatz.

927
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:17,969
Wish I'd just gone home
and played FIFA like Biggz said.

928
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:21,043
Anyone got skins?

929
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:24,203
No.

930
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:28,009
Bare weed and no skins.

931
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:30,042
This is my worst nightmare.

932
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:34,008
Listen, yeah.
We never knew you lived in the block.

933
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,811
If... If we knew you,
we wouldn't have stepped you.

934
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:41,640
It would have been OK to mug me
if I didn't live here? Is that how it works?

935
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:43,284
Boy, you's tetchy.

936
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:45,448
He's tryin' to apologise to you, man.

937
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,768
You're quite fit, you know.

938
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,728
- Have you got a boyfriend?
- Yeah.

939
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,886
Are you sure about him?
Where is he?

940
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,287
Cos he ain't exactly
looking after you tonight.

941
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:03,125
- He's in Ghana.
- You go out with an African man?

942
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:06,482
No, he's helping children.
He volunteers for the Red Cross.

943
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:08,409
Oh, is it?

944
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:11,441
Why can't he help
the children of Britain?

945
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:13,403
Not exotic enough, is it?

946
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,363
Don't get no nice suntan.

947
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:31,128
Raah. Moses, your jacket's gone rave.

948
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,611
It's glowing in the UV light.

949
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:40,762
Maybe it's some kind of pheromone.

950
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,090
PEST: Maybe it's a what now?

951
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:45,726
Er...it's an eco-hormone
that triggers a social response

952
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,603
in members of the same species.

953
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:51,329
Maybe that's a female
and the others are male,

954
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:54,603
and that... that... that stuff
is what's attracting them here.

955
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,529
They're smelling us.

956
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:00,081
They fell out of the sky, yeah?

957
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:05,331
Well, maybe they like drift through space
on... on solar winds, like spores,

958
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:07,886
and...whatever planet they land on first,

959
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,685
the female leaves a pheromone trail
for the males to follow it,

960
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,848
find it, breed, et cetera.

961
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:16,042
Like bees, like beetles, like moths.

962
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,367
Some fucking funny-looking moth.

963
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:20,407
Yeah.

964
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:22,761
Well, whatever it is, you're covered in it

965
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:26,691
and it seems to be piquing the interest
of a rather hostile alien species.

966
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:29,644
I'm just just saying,
maybe if you took those clothes off,

967
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,409
they wouldn't know we were here.

968
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:34,125
You fancy him or something?
Are you trying to get him naked?

969
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:36,401
No, I'm trying to save your life.

970
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:40,730
And in answer to your question earlier...

971
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:46,162
Ah, thank fuck.

972
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:50,881
Bruv, I swear I will never cuss you again.

973
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,681
Yo, Brewis.

974
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,530
Everyone who touched this thing
got murked, you know -

975
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:03,764
Dennis...

976
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,165
Jerome...

977
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,611
Tonks...

978
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,642
them feds when they tried touch me,

979
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:11,488
everyone who had that scent on them.

980
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:14,567
So if they follow the smell on that, then...

981
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:18,327
..maybe I can lead 'em.

982
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,961
- Lead them where?
- Somewhere I can blow them up.

983
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:26,168
I killed that thing.
I brought them in the block.

984
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:29,803
I've gotta finish what I started.

985
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:42,124
- What if it jumps at us?
- Then throw the banger.

986
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:44,401
- What if I miss?
- Then we run.

987
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:46,568
What if it kills us?

988
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:52,090
No one is gonna ever call you Mayhem
if you keep on acting like such a pussy.

989
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:59,043
(Mobile beeping)

990
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:03,284
I'm tellin' the truth! I know I lied to you before,
but it's for real this time, I swear!

991
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:06,483
- (Screeching)
<i>- ..I'm calling your dad. You hear me?</i>

992
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:08,045
Throw it, throw it, throw it!

993
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,121
Now, now, do it!

994
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:12,731
<i>- Are you even listening?</i>
- Mum, I gotta go.

995
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:14,524
Just do as I say and stay indoors.

996
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:18,523
I won't ever do anything bad again,
I promise.

997
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:21,962
- I love you, Mum. I love you.
<i>- Five minutes!</i>

998
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,923
(Screeching)

999
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:43,567
- Any time, blood. Any time.
- We don't give a fuck, man.

1000
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,364
Armed police. Stay where you are!

1001
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:46,811
BOTH: Fuck.

1002
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:55,087
- Wagwan, Biggz.
- What are you doing?

1003
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:57,646
- Armed police, fam.
- Swear down?

1004
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:59,967
- Swear down.
- (Shouting)

1005
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,082
You burnt that thing good. Ratings.

1006
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:05,010
- Easy peasy.
- Lemon squeezy.

1007
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:08,570
Probs and Mayhem, right?

1008
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,563
BOTH: Yeah.

1009
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:14,843
(Sirens wail)

1010
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:29,565
You look clean.

1011
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:31,926
You look good.

1012
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:35,202
I'm betting my life we're right about this.

1013
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:39,766
Believe me, I'd go out there myself
if I wasn't so profoundly stoned.

1014
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:41,963
Likewise.

1015

1018
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:58,846
(Tuts)

1019
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:00,251
What ring, man?

1020
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:03,926
Oh, man, that's ours.

1021
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:06,687

Thanks.

1024
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,764
Even if you outrun them,
even if you make it,

1025
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,165
how are you gonna get out?

1026
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,888
Don't worry about me, man.

1027
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:33,089
You don't have to do this, Moses.

1028
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:36,363
Yeah, I do.

1029
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:02,884
Oi. Hi.

1030
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:04,524
Is it safe?

1031
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,810
No. All right. Good luck.

1032
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:38,961
(Roars)

1033
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:10,486
- Are you sure no one's here?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1034
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:18,931
Who do you live with?

1035
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:21,405
Just my uncle.

1036
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,045
Where's he?

1037
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:30,406
Comes and goes.

1038
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:32,204
Goes, mostly.

1039
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:42,605
You got a little brother?

1040
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:43,766
No.

1041
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:47,605
<i>- How old are you?</i>
- 15.

1042
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:51,045
You look older.

1043
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:52,881
Thanks.

1044
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:00,885
Shut the hatch.

1045
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:02,684

<i>You hear me?</i>

1049
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:19,045
Good luck, Moses.

1051
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:23,202
Moses versus the monsters.

1052
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:26,005
Kill 'em. Kill all them things.

1053
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,724
Allow it.

1054
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,129

- Moses!

1060
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:25,887

1066
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:22,280
Sort of.

1067
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:26,002
Armed police! Put your weapons down!

1068
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:27,849
Down on the ground!
Down on the ground!

1069
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:37,603

Stop resisting. Stop resisting.

1075
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:07,930
- I ain't resisting. You're pushin' me over.
- I don't even live here.

1076

I am registered disabled.
You're hurting me.

What's your number, huh?

1078

I know my civil liberties.
I'm a member of fucking Amnesty.

Our Moses saved the planet!
He saved the planet from alien invasion.

1081
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:32,762
He's a hero. He's a legend.

1082
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:35,724
Moses. Call me, yeah?
We'll get you help.

1083
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:37,808
- Call me.
- Yo, Moses.

1084
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:39,763
Hey, Moses. Moses.

1085
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:43,243
Why do you always arrest the wrong people?

1086
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:46,443
Moses is a hero, don't you get it?
He saved the block.

1087
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:48,084
Excuse me, sir.

1088
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:50,845
This is Samantha Adams,
the woman that called in the mugging.

1089
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:54,601
Miss Adams, I believe you were out
with two of my officers earlier tonight?

1090
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:58,004
- You know they lost their lives?
- Yeah. I was there.

1091
01:17:58,040 --> 01:17:59,690
We were attacked.

1092
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:01,802
Those boys there,
the ones you're arresting...

1093
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:03,729
Can you confirm it was them?

1094
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:05,444
Don't let them intimidate you, miss.

1095
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:10,766
No. I know them. They're my neighbours.

1096
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:13,044
They protected me.

1097
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:15,441
