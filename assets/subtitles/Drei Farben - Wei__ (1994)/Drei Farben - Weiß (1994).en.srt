1
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,753
THREE COLORS
RED

2
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,436
Come here.

3
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,591
320 04 86.

4
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,873
Leave your name and number
and I'II get back to you.

5
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,590
Valentine?

6
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,236
Valentine?

7
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,634
Are you home?
Are you there?

8
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,039
I'll call back later.

9
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,028
Michel...
I was having breakfast.

10
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,477
First it was busy, now the machine.
Are you alone?

11
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,396
Alone.

12
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,555
All alone?

13
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:40,112
AII alone. They just called me
for a photo session.

14
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,992
They want to see me.

15
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,954
When did you get back?

16
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,152
Yesterday. I called,
but you weren't home.

17
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,313
Our car was stolen in Poland.
They got everything:

18
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,159
passports, money, clothes...

19
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,078
So what happened?

20
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,236
We found a nice guy
who put us up.

21
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,193
The Embassy gave us money
and passports. We made it home.

22
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,799
Michel?

23
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,911
I felt lonely last night.

24
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,714
What did you do?

25
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,036
All night long
I slept with your jacket.

26
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,992
I wanted to be with you.

27
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,236
I can't now, Valentine.

28
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,558
I know.
What's the weather like there?

29
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,910
Typical English weather:
it's pouring.

30
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,878
It rained here yesterday.

31
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,874
Now it's sunny. It's springtime.

32
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,593
What did you do last night?

33
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,554
I took your advice
and saw The Dead Poets Society,

34
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,556
What a good movie!

35
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,795
I liked it a lot.

36
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,353
I'll call you tonight.

37
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,949
I'll be back at 7.
I'll stay in.

38
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,195
I'll talk to you later.

39
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,469
I miss you.

40
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,635
Me too.

41
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,555
Personal weather reports.

42
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,353
Hello.

43
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,397
Lose?

44
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,075
Take that out.

45
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,229
Take your sweater.

46
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,518
Tie it around your neck.

47
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,150
The sleeve too.

48
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,315
Like this?

49
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,519
Give me a profile.

50
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,788
No, don't smile.

51
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,955
Be sad.

52
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,635
Sadder.
Think of something awful.

53
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,636
There.

54
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,468
Sad.

55
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,399
Now it's coming.
That's it.

56
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,479
Turn. And 6 and 7
on the bar.

57
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,195
And 1 and 2
and 3 and 4 and stretch,

58
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,836
and 6 and 7 and 8 and bend,

59
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,315
and 3 and 4 and arch,

60
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,957
and 6 and 7 and stretch,
and stretch and stretch.

61
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,795
Stretch out your chin,
your arm, your fingertips.

62
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,157
Stretch out your hand, your neck.

63
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,550
Relax your toes.
Stretch.

64
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,914
I almost fell.

65
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,272
Excuse me...
the door was open.

66
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,199
I'm sorry. I ran over

67
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,389
your dog.

68
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,314
Rita. A German shepherd.

69
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,511
That's possible.

70
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,913
She disappeared yesterday.

71
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,236
She's in my car. Alive.

72
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,639
I don't know what to do.

73
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,589
Should I take her to a veterinarian?

74
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,429
As you wish.

75
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,631
If I ran over your daughter,

76
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,230
would you be so indifferent?

77
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,111
I have no daughter, Miss.

78
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,269
Go away.

79
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,395
Don't close the door.

80
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,110
She's fine.
We stitched her up.

81
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,072
Otherwise, she has a few bruises.

82
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,638
She'll need some rest.

83
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,473
She's pregnant.

84
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,237
Will you take her
or leave her here?

85
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,309
I'll take her.

86
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,471
We'll help you carry her.

87
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,276
Marc...

88
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,550
Are you alone?

89
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:12,996
No.

90
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,828
Tell him something.

91
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,478
Did you hear?
I have a dog.

92
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,759
A dog. I ran her over.

93
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,079
Michel, I'm sorry.

94
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,669
That wasn't funny.

95
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,029
No, it wasn't.

96
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,391
I knew it was a joke.
I could see you laughing.

97
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,716
Do you remember how we met?

98
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,955
I remember...

99
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,312
We're lucky
I stepped out during the break.

100
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,509
That's true.

101
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,308
Valentine, return the dog.

102
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:54,035
I tried.
The owner doesn't want it.

103
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,749
Who is he?

104
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,672
I hear an alarm.

105
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,235
It's my car.

106
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,078
Wait for me
to turn it off.

107
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,349
I'm in a rush.

108
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,392
I understand.

109
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,955
Move.

110
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,515
Move.

111
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,038
They prefer these.

112
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,714
They'll use the slogan:
"A Breath of Life".

113
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,588
Which do you prefer?

114
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,276
I like this one.

115
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,708
Me too.

116
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,999
25 by 65 feet.

117
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,633
Will people recognize you?

118
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,755
Who?

119
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,554
Who are you thinking of?

120
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,954
Not you.

121
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,552
That's a bad sign.

122
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,754
I think I know why I won.
Goodbye.

123
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,676
So long.

124
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,353
You're back already.
The mailman left money for you.

125
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,675
Who sent it?

126
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,630
I have no idea.

127
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,435
Isn't that your brother?

128
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,878
Or someone who looks like him.

129
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,356
What a shame.
Does your family read this paper?

130
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,918
I don't know. Thank you.

131
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:52,916
Goodbye.

132
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,317
Can I speak to Marie, please?

133
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,716
It's Valentine.
Will you see Marc soon?

134
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,393
Tonight, probably.

135
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,996
Tell him to call me
at any hour.

136
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,877
I'll let you run around.

137
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,878
But don't run away.

138
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,876
You promise?

139
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,151
Go on.

140
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,470
Excuse me.
My dog ran away.

141
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,636
Call her. She's yours.

142
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,751
- Was it you?
- For the vet.

143
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,350
- You found my address?
- That was easy.

144
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,232
You don't know the prices.

145
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,951
It cost 130 francs.

146
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,078
You sent me 600.

147
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,959
Wait. I'll get the change.

148
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,189
What about Rita?

149
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,274
She's a very intelligent dog.

150
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,995
Take her.

151
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,958
-You don't want her?
-I want nothing.

152
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,796
Then stop breathing.

153
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,635
Good idea.

154
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,919
You don't breathe anymore?

155
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,712
If you don't come,
you'll never see me again.

156
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,236
But today is Sunday.

157
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,876
Yesterday was Saturday
and we were together.

158
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,949
I'm sorry, Sir.
We're about to have lunch.

159
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,638
I ask one thing of you:
don't call me "Sir".

160
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,112
Talk to me like yesterday.
Call me Pierrot.

161
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,717
Call me "my love".
Say "my love"...

162
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,389
Sir, let me change rooms.

163
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,155
Pierre, I'm alone now.

164
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:38,872
So am I.

165
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,713
Far from you. I want you to come.
I can't be alone...

166
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,194
I saw you yesterday.
I miss you too.

167
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,317
Understand that.

168
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,114
I don't want to.
I'm thinking of you.

169
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:57,151
You're naked in front of the mirror.
But for someone else, not for me.

170
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,396
I want to kiss you.
I lean forward,

171
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,953
I touch your lips...

172
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,229
What are you doing?

173
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:11,990
I'm spying.

174
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:12,992
What?

175
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,597
I'm listening
to my neighbors' phone calls.

176
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,156
You cut it off
just as it was getting interesting.

177
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,117
You don't find it entertaining?

178
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,636
It's disgusting.

179
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,556
Yes.

180
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,198
What's more, it's illegal.

181
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,508
Your 30 francs.

182
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,679
One minute, Miss.

183
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,594
You're persuaded you are right.

184
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:56,916
Yes.

185
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,989
Then why

186
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,349
don't you do anything?

187
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:01,876
What?

188
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,910
Can't I touch your scar,

189
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,230
like yesterday?

190
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,833
Go see this man.

191
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,037
Tell him someone listens
to his conversations.

192
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,912
While you're at it,
tell him

193
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,075
it's me.

194
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,315
I will.

195
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,319
It's that house.

196
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,915
May I see your husband?

197
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:42,272
He's upstairs on the phone.
Let me shut off the gas.

198
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,993
Come in, please.

199
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,669
Have a seat.

200
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,199
He'll be right down.

201
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,919
Caroline, don't play...

202
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,031
...with the phone.
Daddy's talking.

203
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:22,877
Excuse me.

204
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,749
I'm at the wrong address.

205
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,473
This is number 22.

206
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,272
I'm very sorry.

207
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,629
No problem.

208
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,589
Have a nice day.

209
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,351
Goodbye.

210
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,198
I'll call you later.

211
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,959
You lost this.

212
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,592
So? Did you tell him?

213
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,357
Would you like
something to drink?

214
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,913
No, I wouldn't.

215
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,634
I came back...

216
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,235
I came back to ask you something.

217
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,033
Don't do this any more.

218
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,031
I've done it all my life.

219
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,394
What were you?

220
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,876
A cop?

221
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,432
Worse. A judge.

222
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,596
A judge?

223
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,631
You've never seen one
for real?

224
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,559
Would you like to try?
It makes...

225
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,954
a lovely sound.

226
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,957
I don't know whether I was
on the good or the bad side.

227
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:09,712
Here, at least, I know
where the truth is.

228
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,518
My point of view is better
than in a courtroom.

229
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,557
No.

230
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,397
Everyone deserves a private life.

231
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,314
Of course.

232
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:26,594
Why did you stop short?
Why didn't you tell him?

233
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,155
Because he has a sweet wife,

234
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,915
devoted to him?

235
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:39,277
And a little daughter who loves him?
So you couldn't.

236
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,955
Did you feel remorse...

237
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,515
or were you afraid to do harm?

238
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,639
Maybe both.

239
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,313
Let me tell you.

240
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,675
It matters little
whether I spy or you tell them.

241
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,519
Sooner or later,

242
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,912
he'll jump out a window,

243
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,759
or she'll find out everything.

244
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:11,436
Someone will tell their daughter
and it will be living hell.

245
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,158
What can we do about it?

246
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,999
Why are you so quiet?

247
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,598
Does this remind you of something?

248
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,392
-Yes.
-What?

249
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,829
Say it.

250
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,394
A boy I know.

251
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,431
A boy you know who...

252
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,871
found out his mother was a whore?

253
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,679
Who learned...

254
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,272
he's not his father's son.

255
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,919
He was fifteen.

256
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,590
That man's daughter...

257
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,039
she knows too.

258
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,479
Stay a minute.

259
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,429
Why?

260
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,718
The light is beautiful.

261
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,471
Personal weather reports.

262
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,955
I'm driving to Turin tomorrow.

263
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,038
I checked. The weather
will be fine to Chamonix.

264
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,437
From Chamonix to the tunnel,
it may snow.

265
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,359
And after the tunnel...
one minute...

266
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,199
I know the weather all over Europe.

267
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,439
Up to Turin,
the weather will be fine.

268
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,756
Leave early to avoid the snow.

269
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,712
This service is a great idea.

270
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,353
Thank you. Goodbye.

271
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,954
Personal weather reports.

272
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,029
It's me.

273
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,435
Did you get any sleep?

274
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,595
A little.

275
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,079
I didn't tell you.
By telephone it may be easier.

276
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,038
It was really great.

277
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,918
We'd never made love so well,
so long.

278
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,719
We learned something.
Me from you. You from me.

279
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,910
When I woke up, you were
still sleeping. Like a child.

280
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,235
I'm older than you.

281
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,351
- One year!
- No, two.

282
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:36,680
Okay. Two. When I saw you, I got
scared. What is this leading to?

283
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,232
You sound a little down.

284
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,433
Are you nervous
about your exams?

285
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:45,076
About what I'm going to do.
Will it be enough for you?

286
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,156
Why not go bowling?

287
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,872
I opened all my books.

288
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,953
Maybe.
Do you have a coin?

289
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:51,956
Yes.

290
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,994
Flip it. Tails is bowling.
Heads is Penal Code.

291
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,718
Tails. Bowling.

292
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,272
I'll work for an hour,
then I'll call you.

293
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,390
Or I will.

294
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,431
I'll wait. If I go out,

295
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,756
it's just to buy cigarettes.

296
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,592
You didn't listen?

297
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,033
What a shame. It was romantic.

298
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,759
I heard the beginning.

299
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,749
They're in love.

300
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,397
Yes.

301
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,880
He hasn't met the right woman yet.

302
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,389
How do you know?

303
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,874
I watch them from my window.

304
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,633
You think I'm a bastard?

305
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,670
Yes.

306
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,269
Come look.

307
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:59,071
He bought a telephone in Japan
that uses another wavelength.

308
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,270
My radio can't pick it up.
Too bad.

309
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,118
I think he's responsible for most
of the heroin trade in Geneva.

310
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,713
We have nothing on him.

311
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,398
He never takes risks.

312
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,514
Do you like him?

313
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,510
Very much.

314
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,830
I'll call him.

315
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,157
You have his phone number?

316
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,549
You deserve to die.

317
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,310
What did I do?

318
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,712
Here's his phone number.

319
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,875
If you feel like saying
mean things to him, don't hesitate.

320
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,036
At 10 o'clock, I turned off
the lights. I couldn't sleep.

321
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,515
Next program.
Not very interesting.

322
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,150
I kept tossing and turning.
It kept hurting.

323
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,552
It still does.

324
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,072
I haven't done the errands.

325
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,355
I'm sorry, mother.

326
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,232
I have no milk or bread.

327
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,591
I bought you some.
I put it in the freezer.

328
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,635
I ate it all.

329
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,831
You didn't eat 7 loaves...

330
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,151
...in 4 days.
I'm sick of this.

331
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,477
Go do her errands.

332
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,393
Maybe you'd feel better.

333
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:17,990
Maybe she's the one...

334
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,428
...who'd feel better.

335
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,270
Why did you pick up Rita?

336
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,478
Because I'd run over her.

337
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,598
She was bleeding.

338
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,312
Otherwise,
you'd have felt guilty.

339
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,875
You'd have dreamt of a dog
with a crushed skull.

340
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,151
Yes.

341
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,717
So who did you do it for?

342
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:48,039
Don't bother
doing that lady's errands.

343
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,753
She has everything she needs.

344
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,510
She wants to see her daughter.

345
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,392
She already came 5 times,

346
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,114
when her mother
faked a heart attack.

347
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,949
After she dies,
I'll have to call the daughter.

348
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,433
She doesn't believe her any more.

349
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,989
You're mistaken.

350
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,309
About what?

351
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,435
About everything.

352
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,830
Everything.

353
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,516
People aren't bad.

354
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,955
It's not true.

355
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,430
Yes.

356
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,279
They may be weak sometimes...

357
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:38,275
The boy who learned
his father wasn't his father...

358
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,357
your boyfriend or your brother?

359
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:43,990
My brother.

360
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,519
How old is he?

361
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,676
16.

362
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,348
How long
has he been shooting up?

363
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,275
How do you know?

364
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,357
It wasn't hard to guess.

365
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,514
I can only feel pity for you.

366
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,628
Maybe you don't know.

367
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,473
Your dog is pregnant.

368
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:33,796
It's Valentine.

369
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,149
Hello, darling.

370
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,952
Mom, did Marc come?

371
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,118
Two days ago. With his girlfriend.
Do you know her?

372
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,355
Yes. Marie.

373
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:44,279
We're all together.
They're watching TV.

374
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,269
I'm sorry
I can't be there.

375
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,516
Too bad.
It's like old times.

376
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,312
Your brother's a good boy.

377
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,635
Can I talk to him?

378
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,319
Marc!
He's coming.

379
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,112
Call me, Mom.
I love you.

380
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,277
Hi, Valentine.

381
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,596
Thanks for going there.

382
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,394
We're leaving tomorrow.
I can't stand it.

383
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,514
Mom didn't see the paper?

384
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,314
I don't think so.
She'd never believe it...

385
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,313
You're right.
You should go home.

386
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,475
Bye.

387
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,598
Call me, Michel.

388
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,672
Please, call me.

389
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,873
Dld you see the picture?

390
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,035
The picture?

391
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,310
Is that you, Jacques?

392
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,795
Isn't it amazing?
You didn't see it?

393
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,873
I forgot.
I've had a hard day.

394
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,071
Come meet us.
It'll relax you.

395
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:36,917
Where?

396
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,355
Not bad!

397
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,470
I'm sorry to bother you...

398
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,035
Someone played a stupid prank.
I can't get in.

399
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:10,036
Those kids...

400
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,231
Turks. Always trouble.

401
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,189
I don't know.
They stuck chewing gum in my lock.

402
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,948
Tweezers.

403
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,116
It's me.

404
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,309
Michel...

405
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,397
I just called.
There was no answer.

406
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,352
Someone stuck chewing gum
in my lock.

407
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:37,879
I heard the phone.

408
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:38,876
Chewing gum?

409
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:44,072
I did an ad for chewing gum.
That must be why.

410
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,428
I told you not to.
They take advantage of you.

411
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:50,794
Forget it.

412
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,033
There was no answering machine.

413
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,633
All I want is peace.

414
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,673
A life of peace and quiet.

415
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:04,235
Life won't be peaceful with me.

416
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,472
Did you meet someone?

417
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,229
No. I'm waiting for you.

418
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,194
Why didn't you answer before?

419
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,039
I told you.
I couldn't get inside.

420
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,309
I understand.

421
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,428
How are you?

422
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,631
I'm going to Hungary next week.

423
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,279
What are you doing?

424
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:28,476
I'm going to bed.

425
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:29,556
Go ahead!

426
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:31,675
Go on!

427
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:35,589
Are you there?

428
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,559
Michel, are you there?

429
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,273
It's starting again...

430
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,389
Are you asleep?

431
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,109
No, I'm not.

432
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,594
Get into bed.

433
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,709
Are you in bed?

434
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:18,150
I'm taking a shower.
I was getting undressed.

435
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,839
No one is helping you?

436
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,792
Valentine, are you there?

437
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:27,709
No. Goodnight.

438
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,831
I knew you'd make it.

439
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,719
Did they ask the question?

440
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,112
From the book
you dropped in the street.

441
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,433
You don't like it?

442
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,475
Yes. Very much.

443
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,949
What will be
the first judgement I sign?

444
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,393
Civil hearing.

445
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,629
The inhabitants of Pinchat

446
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:03,400
against Joseph Kern.
Please enter.

447
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:08,279
I'd like number 432.
Van den Budenmayer.

448
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,558
- Did I pronounce it right?
- Yes.

449
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,469
This one?

450
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,792
I just sold the last one.

451
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:23,190
I'll have others this afternoon.
I can set one aside.

452
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,273
Whose paper is this?

453
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,635
Yours.

454
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:10,190
I came...

455
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,478
I saw the newspaper...

456
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,671
I want you to know
I didn't tell a soul.

457
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,199
I know.

458
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,833
No one. Not the police. No one.

459
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:22,229
I know.

460
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:26,874
I know who it was.

461
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:29,469
Who?

462
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:31,954
It was me.

463
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,517
You asked me to.

464
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,879
Won't you come in?

465
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,232
Let me show you something.

466
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:03,708
One, two, three, four, five, six.

467
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:05,351
Seven?

468
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,435
Seven.

469
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,640
Won't you have some pear brandy?

470
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,237
I've had it for ages,
but I've never had an occasion.

471
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,114
To my health.

472
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,918
Why did you do it?

473
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:49,437
Why did I turn myself in?

474
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:50,716
Yes.

475
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:56,231
To see what you'd do
once you saw it in your paper.

476
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:58,636
You thought...

477
00:54:58,840 --> 00:54:59,716
...I would come?

478
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,639
After our last conversation,
I thought so.

479
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:05,433
Why?

480
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,278
Do you expect something
from me?

481
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,469
Yes.

482
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,595
Before you left,
you mentioned

483
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:22,789
pity.

484
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,356
Afterwards, I realized
it was disgust.

485
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,436
Will you sit down for a moment?

486
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:49,995
Will you smile for me?

487
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,236
The day you left,

488
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,555
you cried.

489
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:01,989
I cried.

490
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,397
And I shut off my radio.

491
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,277
I sat down at my desk.

492
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:16,119
The fountain pen I'd used
all my life was out of ink,

493
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,833
so I took a pencil

494
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:21,352
and wrote letters to my neighbors
and to the police.

495
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,392
I mailed them that evening.

496
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,951
While you were sleeping soundly.

497
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,112
I wasn't sleeping.

498
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,470
I had gone bowling.

499
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:37,159
Do you remember
that couple's conversation?

500
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,913
The boy and the girl?

501
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,188
I remember.

502
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,233
They wanted to go too.

503
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:45,873
That same evening.

504
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:49,075
Maybe you were
right next to them.

505
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:52,955
Maybe.

506
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,513
You didn't like her.

507
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:02,112
It's almost over.
I was right.

508
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:08,150
You seem happy about it.

509
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,431
Did you provoke it?

510
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:25,869
Yes or no?

511
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,757
Because of my eavesdropping
and my trial,

512
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:33,395
the girl met

513
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:34,953
another man.

514
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:06,708
Good day.

515
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,077
Since then, she's been alone.

516
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:15,150
I asked my brother
to go see her.

517
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,676
He stayed three days.

518
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:24,518
In one week
I'm going to England.

519
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,711
I'm abandoning my mother
and my brother.

520
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,115
Every day he gets a little worse.

521
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,399
I shouldn't leave.

522
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:34,239
Leave. It's your destiny.

523
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,517
You can't live your brother's life

524
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:37,869
for him.

525
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,028
I love him.

526
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:49,152
If only I could help.

527
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:50,915
You can.

528
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,395
Be.

529
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,953
What do you mean?

530
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:58,274
That's all: be.

531
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,915
Do you like flying?

532
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,712
Then take the ferry.

533
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,998
I've never taken one.

534
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,708
It's less expensive and healthier.

535
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,273
That's a good idea.

536
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:24,794
Do you like it?

537
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:28,031
Today is my birthday.

538
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:29,679
I didn't know.

539
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:36,872
35 years ago today,
at about the same time, 5 o'clock,

540
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,910
I acquitted a man. A sailor.

541
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:45,713
One of my first big cases.
It was a tough time in my life.

542
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:51,236
I have since realized
I made a mistake.

543
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:54,392
He was guilty.

544
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:01,037
I'm all out of bulbs.

545
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,479
What happened to him?

546
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:33,391
I did my own investigation.

547
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:37,152
He's married with three children.

548
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,590
A grandson.

549
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,154
He is living in peace.

550
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,915
So you did what was necessary.

551
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,153
And you did it well.

552
01:00:58,080 --> 01:00:59,718
Don't you understand?

553
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,079
You saved him.

554
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:05,879
Perhaps.

555
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:10,309
But how many others
could I have acquitted? Even guilty?

556
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:16,552
Deciding what is true and what isn't
now seems to me...

557
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:19,676
...a lack of modesty.

558
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:22,749
Vanity?

559
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:25,669
Vanity.

560
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,958
Can I have a drop?

561
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,235
To you!

562
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:54,397
If I had to go to court...

563
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:58,479
are there still judges like you?

564
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:01,358
You won't go to court.

565
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:04,829
Justice doesn't deal
with the innocent.

566
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:09,073
See that?

567
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,750
It's the sixth window
they've broken.

568
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:15,953
The wavelength has been changed.
I can no longer eavesdrop.

569
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,679
Where is the broom?

570
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:21,757
In the kitchen closet.

571
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,836
Put the stone
on the piano.

572
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:04,273
You're not afraid?

573
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:09,553
I wonder what I'd do
in their pIace.

574
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:12,754
The same thing.

575
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:15,958
You'd throw stones?

576
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:19,073
In their place? Of course.

577
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:22,435
And that goes
for everyone I judged.

578
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,473
Given their lives,
I would steal,

579
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:28,433
I'd kill, I'd lie.
Of course I would.

580
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:33,678
All that because I wasn't...

581
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:35,472
...in their shoes, but mine.

582
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:42,717
Is there someone you love?

583
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:50,912
Have you ever loved?

584
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:59,559
Yesterday I dreamt...

585
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:03,959
I dreamt of you.

586
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,829
You were 40 or 50 years old,

587
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:13,432
and you were happy.

588
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,590
Do your dreams come true?

589
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:23,472
It's been years
since I dreamt something nice.

590
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,468
Stay there!

591
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:55,472
I bought a ticket
for the ferry.

592
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:58,990
I arrive in England
next Wednesday.

593
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:04,432
At 7:30 a.m.

594
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:05,959
Why the ferry?

595
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:09,839
So I can visit my mother
near Calais.

596
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:13,632
I'll meet you at 8:00.

597
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,153
I'm happy you're coming.

598
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,074
Michel, tell me...

599
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:21,350
do you love me?

600
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:22,675
I think so.

601
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:25,873
You love me
or you think so?

602
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:27,479
It's the same thing.

603
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:52,313
The battery.

604
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:53,833
Auguste!

605
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,436
Personal weather reports.

606
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:32,074
I've tried calling
for a few days.

607
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:33,793
I was sick. I'm sorry.

608
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,231
What will the weather be
on the English Channel next week?

609
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:40,796
Wonderful. Sunny, a slight breeze,
chilly in the morning.

610
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,319
Why are you laughing?

611
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:45,353
I intend to go there.
Even farther.

612
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:46,675
For your work?

613
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:49,348
No, for pleasure. On a yacht.

614
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:50,834
It's a nice sail.

615
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,234
Yes, very.

616
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:53,555
You'll be closing?

617
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:55,113
I'll have to.

618
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:57,675
That's too bad.
It was a good idea. Goodbye.

619
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:36,635
We told you
not to smile!

620
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:38,908
Be serious!

621
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:43,471
Can you send an invitation
to this address?

622
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:44,874
Just one person?

623
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:30,275
Are you okay?

624
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:32,749
- So long.
- Have a good time.

625
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,313
There's no make-up remover?

626
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:43,430
Here.

627
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:56,755
Everyone noticed...

628
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:57,949
...that guy.

629
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:02,070
During the entire show
I kept staring at him.

630
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:27,639
You came.

631
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:30,831
You knew the invitation
came from me?

632
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:32,234
I'd hoped so.

633
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:34,713
Did you look for me?

634
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:37,192
During the entire show.

635
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:42,750
I'm leaving tomorrow.
I wanted to say goodbye.

636
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:45,069
Goodbye.

637
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:50,400
I'd like you
to tell me in detail...

638
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:52,352
...the dream you had.

639
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,677
You were 50 years old

640
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:58,993
and you were happy.

641
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:01,674
In this dream...

642
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:05,397
was there someone else?

643
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:07,595
There was.

644
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:10,389
Who?

645
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:16,238
You woke up

646
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,355
and you smiled at someone
next to you.

647
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:21,679
I don't know who.

648
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:25,038
That's what will happen?

649
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:28,159
In 20 or 25 years?

650
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:29,630
Yes.

651
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:36,957
What else do you know?

652
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:39,751
Who are you?

653
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:42,959
A retired judge.

654
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:47,958
I feel something important
is happening around me.

655
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:50,959
And it scares me.

656
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:03,155
Is that better?

657
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:08,199
I used to come here often.

658
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:11,672
Where did you usually sit?

659
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,353
Where I sat today.

660
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:17,950
That's why you couldn't see me.

661
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:25,716
One day,
during the intermission,

662
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:28,869
the elastic holding my books broke.

663
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:31,037
One of them,

664
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:34,152
a big one,
fell down...

665
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:36,558
somewhere around here.

666
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:42,069
It was just before my exams.
I ran down immediately.

667
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:45,831
The book had opened to a certain
page. I read a few sentences.

668
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:49,193
It was the question they asked
during my exam.

669
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:52,675
Getting out of the house
did you good.

670
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:56,078
I had to recharge the battery.

671
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:58,075
It was dead.

672
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:01,789
The storm.

673
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:32,078
Lousy coffee.

674
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:35,679
I was wondering...

675
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,358
...why you mentioned that sailor.

676
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:40,839
Do you know why?

677
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:45,115
Yes.

678
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:54,513
Because...

679
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:59,598
...you didn't want to tell me
something more important.

680
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:06,438
About the woman
that you loved.

681
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:11,919
She betrayed you.

682
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:17,518
She betrayed you,

683
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:20,995
and you never understood why.

684
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:26,558
And you kept on loving her.

685
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,952
How do you know all this?

686
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:38,436
It wasn't hard to guess.

687
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:42,399
What was she like?

688
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:46,835
She graduated
two years before me.

689
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:53,031
She was blond,

690
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:55,233
delicate,

691
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:59,438
radiant, with a long neck.

692
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:05,710
Her clothing and her furniture
were all light-colored.

693
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:10,589
In the foyer there was a mirror
in a white frame.

694
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:14,552
It was in that mirror,

695
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,513
one night,

696
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:19,357
that I saw her white legs spread,

697
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,991
with a man between them.

698
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:29,469
Why...

699
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:32,117
...did that happen?

700
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:34,119
Do you know?

701
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:38,679
This man,
whose name was Hugo Holbling,

702
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:44,556
could offer her what she wanted.

703
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:48,439
They left.

704
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:52,512
I followed them.

705
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:56,514
I crossed France, the Channel...

706
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:00,039
I was...

707
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,153
humiliated.

708
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:07,313
Until the day she died
in an accident.

709
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:12,873
Since then,
I've never loved another woman.

710
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:15,117
Yes.

711
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:17,478
I stopped believing.

712
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:21,835
Maybe I never met the woman...

713
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:28,677
Maybe you're the woman
I never met.

714
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:32,432
The story doesn't end there.

715
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,074
No.

716
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:37,517
A while ago,

717
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:39,870
I was given a difficult case.

718
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:43,591
On it was written the name
of the defendant:

719
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:45,279
Hugo Holbling.

720
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:46,833
The same man.

721
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:49,193
He'd come back here.

722
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:56,559
I'm closing up.

723
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:00,638
Did you see a woman
with a bucket?

724
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:06,751
The storm flooded the wardrobe.

725
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:07,876
If you see her,

726
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:09,799
tell her I'm upstairs.

727
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,991
You shouldn't have taken the case.

728
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:19,749
I didn't want to.

729
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:26,154
At first,
I wanted to kill him.

730
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:31,358
I would have,
if it would have changed something.

731
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:35,070
Now,

732
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:37,877
he was waiting for my verdict.

733
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:43,517
He was building
a covered market which caved in.

734
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:45,597
Several people died.

735
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:49,872
I said he was guilty.

736
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:53,237
It was a legal sentence.

737
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:00,353
Afterwards,
I asked for early retirement.

738
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:05,593
Did you see her?

739

You seemed to like
my pear brandy.
