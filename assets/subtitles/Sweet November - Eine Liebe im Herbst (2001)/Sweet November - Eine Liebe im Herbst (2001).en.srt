1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
SWEET NOVEMBER (2001)

2
00:01:03,175 --> 00:01:04,233
That was good.

3
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:08,603
Top dog, big dog, bad dog.

4
00:01:11,216 --> 00:01:12,706
Who's the best dog?

5
00:01:12,951 --> 00:01:14,578
That's my dog.

6
00:01:15,487 --> 00:01:17,512
Who's the best dog?

7
00:01:17,923 --> 00:01:19,584
That's my dog.

8
00:01:20,225 --> 00:01:22,352
It's a big, bad dog.

9
00:01:37,576 --> 00:01:39,339
Number one dog. Dog at the top.

10
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,640
Slow down, Fido. We need to talk.

11
00:01:42,948 --> 00:01:44,279
-Yeah?
-Vince.

12
00:01:44,483 --> 00:01:47,975
You see the Vitagirl numbers?
You hit that demographic dead on.

13
00:01:48,286 --> 00:01:49,617
Yeah, looking good.

14
00:01:49,821 --> 00:01:51,482
-Talk about what?
-Us.

15
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:54,158
We're 24 hours away
from fast-food fame...

16
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:57,226
...or oblivion.
Will you sign off on that copy?

17
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:58,418
No.

18
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,291
No? What do you mean, no?

19
00:02:00,499 --> 00:02:03,297
Nelson, we've been
killing ourselves with this--

20
00:02:03,502 --> 00:02:04,935
-What?
-Meet you in 20.

21
00:02:05,137 --> 00:02:06,126
Nelson!

22
00:02:09,141 --> 00:02:11,268
I remember growing up.

23
00:02:11,476 --> 00:02:13,000
-Summertime...
-I'm starving!

24
00:02:13,211 --> 00:02:14,940
-...baseball. ..
-Ready for the game?

25
00:02:15,147 --> 00:02:16,671
-You bet.
-Go get 'em!

26
00:02:16,882 --> 00:02:18,281
...and Dr. Diggity Dogs.

27
00:02:18,483 --> 00:02:22,010
Us. Isn't there some kind of limit
on the "us" talks?

28
00:02:22,354 --> 00:02:24,083
One, okay. Two, if necessary.

29
00:02:24,289 --> 00:02:26,052
Three, cruel and unusual.

30
00:02:26,258 --> 00:02:27,247
Great dog, big dog.

31
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:30,257
Forgot about my parents, didn't you?

32
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:33,229
I can't make it. I'm sorry.

33
00:02:33,732 --> 00:02:36,565
Nelson, this is their third trip
to the city.

34
00:02:37,669 --> 00:02:40,069
You could make an effort.

35
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,907
This is important to me.

36
00:02:43,108 --> 00:02:45,133
This account is very important to me.

37
00:02:45,577 --> 00:02:49,069
It's Dr. Diggity,
practically an American institution.

38
00:02:49,347 --> 00:02:50,837
American institution.

39
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:52,516
Dr. Diggity. Amer--

40
00:02:52,718 --> 00:02:53,707
No.

41
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:56,888
You know, there are people
who don't work 24 hours a day.

42
00:02:57,222 --> 00:02:59,588
They stop, relax...

43
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:01,725
...have lives.

44
00:03:05,197 --> 00:03:08,462
I have a life, Angelica.
And I'm late for it.

45
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:16,498
I'm not sure I like the tag line.

46
00:03:16,775 --> 00:03:18,743
It needs to be deadpan.

47
00:03:18,944 --> 00:03:23,574
-I want to play with it.
-If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

48
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,641
That rule applies to mediocrity.

49
00:03:27,853 --> 00:03:30,185
-We want perfection.
-We want a check.

50
00:03:30,388 --> 00:03:31,980
You worry too much.

51
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,681
Worrying about losing
keeps you winning.

52
00:03:34,893 --> 00:03:35,882
Congrats.

53
00:03:36,094 --> 00:03:38,688
Nelson, you got the Ad Age
for the Pelican spot.

54
00:03:38,897 --> 00:03:39,955
Give that to me.

55
00:03:40,165 --> 00:03:42,759
Look, it says "team." I'm "team."

56
00:03:42,968 --> 00:03:44,230
God!

57
00:03:48,707 --> 00:03:50,299
-Morning, Mr. Moss.
-Thanks.

58
00:03:50,509 --> 00:03:53,706
-Vince.
-Beatrice, I'll have the--

59
00:03:54,179 --> 00:03:56,409
Edgar Price
is coming out of retirement.

60
00:03:56,615 --> 00:04:00,107
Says he's tired of being ripped off,
might as well rip himself off.

61
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:02,115
Edgar Price, huh?

62
00:04:02,454 --> 00:04:03,443
Was the best.

63
00:04:03,688 --> 00:04:05,417
Remember that Mercedes ad?

64
00:04:05,624 --> 00:04:08,525
The car, floating in outer space,
comes right at you.

65
00:04:08,727 --> 00:04:09,819
Genius.

66
00:04:10,362 --> 00:04:11,351
Check this out.

67
00:04:11,563 --> 00:04:12,552
What?

68
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:16,156
Balance.

69
00:04:16,368 --> 00:04:18,563
How's my dream team?
Got it locked up?

70
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:20,635
Sure, chief. Just finessing--

71
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,807
No, no, it's all locked up.

72
00:04:23,008 --> 00:04:24,498
-It's minor details.
-Minor.

73
00:04:26,945 --> 00:04:27,934
See that?

74
00:04:28,146 --> 00:04:29,511
Make it happen.

75
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,012
Red! Blood red!

76
00:04:33,218 --> 00:04:35,982
I can't read this.
Is English her second language?

77
00:04:37,422 --> 00:04:39,652
You'll love these frames.
I ran with your idea.

78
00:04:39,858 --> 00:04:42,725
It's still your idea, just better.
Client will love it.

79
00:04:45,864 --> 00:04:47,161
Ethnic.

80
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:51,066
Give me a bonfire, three-quarter.

81
00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:53,897
-More cleavage, more dogs.
-There's three girls.

82
00:04:54,105 --> 00:04:56,573
-Let's make this night.
-Night?

83
00:04:59,077 --> 00:05:00,772
What's this, porno?

84
00:05:01,513 --> 00:05:03,174
You said you wanted edge.

85
00:05:04,115 --> 00:05:05,878
-I don't feel it.
-There you are.

86
00:05:06,084 --> 00:05:08,518
-Blood red.
-Forget your 1 :00 at the DMV?

87
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,709
Reschedule.

88
00:05:10,755 --> 00:05:12,279
I don't have time.

89
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,424
Wait till the presentation's over.

90
00:05:14,626 --> 00:05:17,720
If you don't renew today,
they'll suspend your license.

91
00:05:17,929 --> 00:05:20,557
You get pulled over,
they can throw you in jail.

92
00:05:20,765 --> 00:05:22,858
Bet you don't have time
for that either.

93
00:05:23,068 --> 00:05:25,764
Nobody beats the DMV. Not even you.

94
00:05:25,971 --> 00:05:27,063
Bye-bye.

95
00:05:27,272 --> 00:05:28,603
I got it.

96
00:05:29,608 --> 00:05:32,475
-I don't feel it.
-Not feeling it. Blood red.

97
00:05:32,677 --> 00:05:34,645
Blood red! Let's go, let's bleed!

98
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,350
Thanks.

99
00:05:55,133 --> 00:05:58,432
All right, there will be no talking,
eating or drinking...

100
00:05:58,637 --> 00:06:00,104
...during the test.

101
00:06:00,305 --> 00:06:04,241
If your personal hygiene
becomes a distraction...

102
00:06:04,442 --> 00:06:06,535
...you'll be asked to leave.

103
00:06:10,115 --> 00:06:11,446
Sorry.

104
00:06:12,784 --> 00:06:15,548
If you need to use the bathroom,
raise your hand.

105
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,345
Would you pass me the Colombo, please?

106
00:06:18,723 --> 00:06:20,315
Yeah, the salami.

107
00:06:24,296 --> 00:06:25,593
Thanks.

108
00:06:26,998 --> 00:06:30,957
You cannot take the test with you
to the bathroom.

109
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:34,161
If you do not come back
from the bathroom...

110
00:06:34,372 --> 00:06:36,306
...you cannot pass the test.

111
00:06:41,947 --> 00:06:42,971
You may begin.

112
00:06:55,093 --> 00:06:56,958
Falling rocks?

113
00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:00,129
Oh, Christ!

114
00:07:14,679 --> 00:07:15,771
Hey.

115
00:07:19,651 --> 00:07:20,640
Number nine...

116
00:07:21,353 --> 00:07:22,479
...true or false?

117
00:07:22,854 --> 00:07:24,151
Oh.

118
00:07:26,124 --> 00:07:27,591
I'm not there yet.

119
00:07:27,792 --> 00:07:29,191
Sorry.

120
00:07:30,295 --> 00:07:32,661
-But when I do mine--
-Excuse me.

121
00:07:37,068 --> 00:07:39,559
Bring your test papers forward,
please.

122
00:07:48,646 --> 00:07:49,635
Me?

123
00:07:49,914 --> 00:07:51,040
You.

124
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,882
With the scarf, yes.

125
00:08:04,362 --> 00:08:05,556
I wasn't cheating.

126
00:08:05,764 --> 00:08:07,994
Why would I cheat on a DMV test?

127
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:10,531
You may retake the test in 30 days.

128
00:08:12,203 --> 00:08:13,534
That's a joke, right?

129
00:08:15,807 --> 00:08:17,240
Thirty days?

130
00:08:17,442 --> 00:08:18,875
That's a whole month.

131
00:08:22,614 --> 00:08:23,842
Great.

132
00:08:26,217 --> 00:08:27,548
Fine.

133
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,783
Guess I'm going.

134
00:08:32,824 --> 00:08:34,189
Walking.

135
00:08:37,562 --> 00:08:38,620
Hey...

136
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,024
...good luck.

137
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,129
Shane and Dunne.

138
00:08:50,341 --> 00:08:52,332
-Nelson Moss for Vince.
-One moment.

139
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:56,770
-Did Ruben tweak the music?
-No, he said it's fine.

140
00:08:56,981 --> 00:08:58,380
Shit.

141
00:08:59,684 --> 00:09:00,708
Cut him.

142
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:03,945
Get Johnson McDonald.
Give him the sample. Tell him--

143
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:07,486
-You've lost your mind.
-No, beg him for 10 tomorrow.

144
00:09:07,692 --> 00:09:09,592
-That's crazy!
-How did it go?

145
00:09:09,894 --> 00:09:11,555
Did you get your license?

146
00:09:11,763 --> 00:09:12,889
-Vince.
-What?

147
00:09:13,098 --> 00:09:16,727
What do you think about this?
"Barking mad for Dr. Diggity."

148
00:09:16,935 --> 00:09:19,028
-That sucks.
-Congratulations.

149
00:09:19,838 --> 00:09:21,271
You can read.

150
00:09:22,006 --> 00:09:23,735
-Call you back.
-No, no--

151
00:09:24,142 --> 00:09:25,541
Can I help you?

152
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:29,769
Can you help me?

153
00:09:29,981 --> 00:09:31,039
Yeah.

154
00:09:34,285 --> 00:09:35,616
That's your van, isn't it?

155
00:09:37,622 --> 00:09:39,317
Is this your car?

156
00:09:39,858 --> 00:09:41,189
Wow.

157
00:09:41,659 --> 00:09:44,321
-Nice.
-You can't drive, right.

158
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:45,723
No.

159
00:09:46,464 --> 00:09:48,523
This is the way that you....

160
00:09:49,634 --> 00:09:50,862
Right.

161
00:09:51,102 --> 00:09:52,296
Shit.

162
00:09:52,737 --> 00:09:54,295
How much do you make a month?

163
00:09:54,506 --> 00:09:56,064
Doesn't look like much.

164
00:09:56,274 --> 00:09:57,764
I'll cover your expenses.

165
00:09:57,976 --> 00:09:59,944
Here, call my secretary.

166
00:10:00,245 --> 00:10:01,610
We'll work it out.

167
00:10:01,813 --> 00:10:03,974
Is this quest for redemption
from remorse?

168
00:10:04,182 --> 00:10:07,481
Or are you scared my sitting
on your car will cause a dent?

169
00:10:08,153 --> 00:10:09,142
The dent.

170
00:10:10,722 --> 00:10:12,246
That's what I thought.

171
00:10:18,429 --> 00:10:19,555
What are you doing?

172
00:10:19,764 --> 00:10:20,992
Buying redemption.

173
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,631
Redemption's not for sale today.

174
00:10:24,836 --> 00:10:25,996
Sorry.

175
00:10:27,505 --> 00:10:28,938
Okay.

176
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,505
Guess I'm going to hell.

177
00:10:31,442 --> 00:10:33,103
Get off the car.

178
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:35,668
Okay.

179
00:10:39,684 --> 00:10:40,946
Bye.

180
00:10:59,737 --> 00:11:01,602
Yeah, here we go.

181
00:11:01,806 --> 00:11:03,205
I'm gonna get it.

182
00:11:04,075 --> 00:11:05,303
Get it.

183
00:11:07,412 --> 00:11:08,674
Okay.

184
00:11:09,113 --> 00:11:10,341
What is it?

185
00:11:10,715 --> 00:11:12,273
It's a hot dog.

186
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,108
It's a hot dog.

187
00:11:18,056 --> 00:11:19,546
It's a hot
hot dog.

188
00:11:19,757 --> 00:11:21,452
It's a hot dog.

189
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,057
It's a hot dog.

190
00:11:33,905 --> 00:11:34,963
Yeah?

191
00:11:35,173 --> 00:11:37,300
Mr. Moss, it's Manny from downstairs.

192
00:11:37,508 --> 00:11:40,602
We have a bit of a situation.
There's a lady here...

193
00:11:40,812 --> 00:11:43,679
... who's saying strange,
personal things about you.

194
00:11:43,881 --> 00:11:45,212
You can't talk to him!

195
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:47,350
-Move over.
-You can't talk to him.

196
00:11:47,552 --> 00:11:49,816
I can talk to him.
Look, I'm going to.

197
00:11:50,021 --> 00:11:51,545
How are you, big spender?

198
00:11:51,756 --> 00:11:55,317
Remember me? I'm downstairs.
You want to come down here?

199
00:11:56,327 --> 00:11:58,158
I can't stop thinking about you.

200
00:11:59,364 --> 00:12:00,695
-Did he hear me?
-Yeah.

201
00:12:00,898 --> 00:12:03,025
-You sure?
-I think he hear you.

202
00:12:03,234 --> 00:12:04,496
Hello?

203
00:12:04,702 --> 00:12:06,169
Yeah.

204
00:12:06,371 --> 00:12:07,360
Okay, I'll--

205
00:12:07,572 --> 00:12:09,005
-What?
-I'll see you in five.

206
00:12:09,207 --> 00:12:11,107
Okay, I'm down here.

207
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:12,668
Okay?

208
00:12:15,013 --> 00:12:17,004
Then my wife, she says to me:

209
00:12:17,215 --> 00:12:18,580
"You can fix nothing."

210
00:12:18,783 --> 00:12:20,683
So then she leaves me for plumber.

211
00:12:20,885 --> 00:12:23,251
-No.
-Yeah, plumber.

212
00:12:24,155 --> 00:12:25,349
Look at that, Manny.

213
00:12:25,556 --> 00:12:27,285
My very own Prince Charming.

214
00:12:31,396 --> 00:12:35,264
I don't think I've ever met such a
royal asshole in my entire life.

215
00:12:37,335 --> 00:12:40,964
So does your mom know
you treat women like hookers...

216
00:12:41,172 --> 00:12:42,799
...or did she raise you to believe...

217
00:12:43,007 --> 00:12:46,101
...that being nice means
patronizing the whole world?

218
00:12:46,311 --> 00:12:48,438
Uh-oh, I smell trouble.

219
00:12:48,646 --> 00:12:50,739
-Can I talk to you?
-Yeah.

220
00:12:51,082 --> 00:12:52,481
Bye, Manny.

221
00:12:56,454 --> 00:12:58,888
-How did you find me?
-I'm smart.

222
00:12:59,157 --> 00:13:01,625
So, I need a ride.

223
00:13:01,826 --> 00:13:03,054
Is this a joke?

224
00:13:03,561 --> 00:13:05,825
Well, you're the reason I can't drive.

225
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,794
So the least you can do
is schlep me somewhere.

226
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,059
It'll be painless. Where's your car?

227
00:13:13,638 --> 00:13:16,368
Been a ball,
but some of us have to work.

228
00:13:16,574 --> 00:13:18,769
Please don't make me throw a tantrum.

229
00:13:18,976 --> 00:13:22,309
Would you like to get naked with us?
We have a tub full of fudge!

230
00:13:22,513 --> 00:13:23,480
Ignore her.

231
00:13:23,681 --> 00:13:25,308
-It'll be fun!
-Ignore her.

232
00:13:25,516 --> 00:13:27,074
-He's cute!
-What are you doing?

233
00:13:28,553 --> 00:13:29,713
You know what?

234
00:13:29,921 --> 00:13:31,786
You're a flasher.
A flasher!

235
00:13:31,989 --> 00:13:33,980
-It has to stop.
-Mr. and Mrs. Johnson.

236
00:13:34,192 --> 00:13:36,490
-Don't walk away!
-I'll call the police.

237
00:13:36,694 --> 00:13:38,685
-He keeps flashing!
-Medication.

238
00:13:38,896 --> 00:13:39,885
Are you nuts?

239
00:13:40,098 --> 00:13:41,224
I live here.

240
00:13:41,432 --> 00:13:42,763
Do you have any shame?

241
00:13:44,702 --> 00:13:46,795
Well, I just want a ride.

242
00:13:47,505 --> 00:13:48,972
Please?

243
00:13:58,983 --> 00:14:00,450
Oh, by the way...

244
00:14:00,651 --> 00:14:02,209
...I'm Sara Deever.

245
00:14:03,087 --> 00:14:04,577
Nice to meet you.

246
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,085
You want to get in the right lane.

247
00:14:09,327 --> 00:14:11,921
-Put your indicator--
-I know how to drive.

248
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,427
Okay.

249
00:14:13,698 --> 00:14:15,996
You want to take the 80 to Oakland.

250
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,827
-Oakland?
-Yeah.

251
00:14:18,369 --> 00:14:21,964
-You said this would be quick.
-I also said it would be painless.

252
00:14:22,173 --> 00:14:25,108
This is really nice of you
to do this for me.

253
00:14:25,309 --> 00:14:28,540
And I'm sorry if I went too far,
but I did need this ride.

254
00:14:28,746 --> 00:14:30,976
So I really appreciate it. Thanks.

255
00:14:32,417 --> 00:14:33,679
Right here.

256
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:43,550
What do you plan to do with that?

257
00:14:45,129 --> 00:14:47,393
Commit a heinous crime. What else?

258
00:14:47,598 --> 00:14:50,590
You'll wait for me, right? Right?

259
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,368
Of course you will.

260
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,361
What am I doing?

261
00:15:24,602 --> 00:15:26,035
What am I doing?

262
00:15:50,661 --> 00:15:52,424
Go! Go!

263
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,860
Go, go, go!

264
00:16:04,609 --> 00:16:05,598
Oh, my God!

265
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,778
That was so great!

266
00:16:08,479 --> 00:16:10,003
Feel like Bonnie and Clyde?

267
00:16:10,214 --> 00:16:11,704
No, I don't.

268
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:14,077
-Why not?
-They got shot.

269
00:16:18,222 --> 00:16:21,851
-Don't open it. I don't want to know.
-Just relax.

270
00:16:22,226 --> 00:16:25,320
They're just my little furry friends.
Say, "Hi, Nelson."

271
00:16:25,563 --> 00:16:29,932
Somebody was gonna do nasty little
experiments on your brains.

272
00:16:30,134 --> 00:16:32,364
But I wouldn't have it.

273
00:16:37,341 --> 00:16:39,172
What do you do, by the way?

274
00:16:40,511 --> 00:16:42,376
I'm in advertising.

275
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,275
Advertising.

276
00:16:45,016 --> 00:16:46,643
So you enjoy it?

277
00:16:47,618 --> 00:16:50,519
People tend to enjoy
what they're really good at.

278
00:16:53,357 --> 00:16:56,053
Besides your job,
what else makes you miserable?

279
00:16:57,295 --> 00:16:59,092
I mean, what do you do for fun?

280
00:17:02,133 --> 00:17:03,532
I didn't think so.

281
00:17:03,801 --> 00:17:05,928
No hobbies?

282
00:17:06,137 --> 00:17:08,867
No diversions? No kinky obsessions?

283
00:17:09,507 --> 00:17:12,169
For one quick second there,
I thought you--

284
00:17:12,376 --> 00:17:14,173
Just get in the car.

285
00:17:24,755 --> 00:17:26,620
Want to come up for cocoa?

286
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:30,826
As titillating as the evening's been,
I'm afraid not.

287
00:17:32,997 --> 00:17:34,294
Okay.

288
00:17:36,133 --> 00:17:37,760
How about I make you a deal?

289
00:17:37,969 --> 00:17:41,666
Come up for one cup, and I'll
never ask you for another ride.

290
00:17:41,872 --> 00:17:43,430
No, thanks.

291
00:17:45,309 --> 00:17:46,298
Okay.

292
00:17:47,044 --> 00:17:48,238
Thanks.

293
00:17:50,081 --> 00:17:51,810
I'll see you tomorrow then.

294
00:17:52,016 --> 00:17:54,177
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

295
00:17:54,385 --> 00:17:55,579
Hold on.

296
00:17:55,786 --> 00:17:56,912
Hold on.

297
00:17:57,121 --> 00:17:58,850
8:00 is good for you, right?

298
00:17:59,056 --> 00:18:01,923
You, me, Manny, the doorman,
that whole thing?

299
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:20,804
Come in.

300
00:18:26,617 --> 00:18:28,710
There you guys go.

301
00:18:40,698 --> 00:18:42,393
I can help you.

302
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,629
See, I have a gift.

303
00:18:44,835 --> 00:18:47,497
A special ability
to help men with problems.

304
00:18:47,738 --> 00:18:49,035
I don't have problems.

305
00:18:50,141 --> 00:18:52,575
Now, see that, usually,
is the first sign.

306
00:18:52,777 --> 00:18:53,766
Of what?

307
00:18:53,978 --> 00:18:54,967
Denial.

308
00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:56,168
Denial?

309
00:18:56,414 --> 00:18:59,042
First of all,
I think you work too much.

310
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,014
Really?
And what do you know about work?

311
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,878
Plenty.

312
00:19:04,088 --> 00:19:07,956
You admitted you do nothing else
and it doesn't make you happy.

313
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:10,520
I admitted nothing. I was silent.

314
00:19:10,728 --> 00:19:12,559
No special interests, no pets.

315
00:19:12,763 --> 00:19:13,752
You hate dogs.

316
00:19:13,964 --> 00:19:14,953
Busted.

317
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,225
Actually I do have a pet, a fish.

318
00:19:17,568 --> 00:19:18,830
A fish?

319
00:19:19,036 --> 00:19:21,095
Doesn't count. Cold-blooded. Sorry.

320
00:19:21,906 --> 00:19:25,069
No, you are a walking case study.

321
00:19:26,277 --> 00:19:27,266
Look at you.

322
00:19:28,012 --> 00:19:30,640
You're a workaholic
at such an advanced stage...

323
00:19:30,848 --> 00:19:34,306
...that your intimacy skills have
withered away to almost nothing.

324
00:19:34,518 --> 00:19:35,576
Left untreated...

325
00:19:35,786 --> 00:19:38,254
...you could become
emotionally extinct.

326
00:19:39,356 --> 00:19:41,153
Out of sheer perverse curiosity...

327
00:19:41,358 --> 00:19:44,589
...how does a lunatic like you
help a guy like me?

328
00:19:47,064 --> 00:19:48,895
You live in a box.

329
00:19:50,067 --> 00:19:51,466
I could lift the lid...

330
00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:52,863
...let some light in.

331
00:19:54,138 --> 00:19:56,231
Wow, that's deep.

332
00:19:57,108 --> 00:19:59,440
I feel almost cured just hearing it.

333
00:20:01,412 --> 00:20:02,674
Well...

334
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,211
...if you want my help...

335
00:20:04,415 --> 00:20:06,679
...it'll require a commitment
on your part.

336
00:20:08,886 --> 00:20:11,582
You have to live with me here
for a month.

337
00:20:13,124 --> 00:20:14,523
No more, no less...

338
00:20:14,725 --> 00:20:15,987
...and no work allowed.

339
00:20:18,863 --> 00:20:20,330
You don't even know me...

340
00:20:20,698 --> 00:20:23,166
...and you're inviting me to move in?

341
00:20:24,502 --> 00:20:28,302
And how's my girlfriend
supposed to feel about that?

342
00:20:29,173 --> 00:20:30,367
Girlfriend?

343
00:20:30,574 --> 00:20:32,565
You don't have a girlfriend.

344
00:20:34,044 --> 00:20:36,308
I mean, it's something you feel.

345
00:20:36,714 --> 00:20:40,548
There's something intimate a woman
leaves on a man that you don't have.

346
00:20:41,085 --> 00:20:42,484
Her name's Angelica.

347
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,858
Well, I feel sorry for Angelica.

348
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:49,519
Great.

349
00:20:51,061 --> 00:20:55,293
I'll relay that to her when I leave.
Which is...right about now.

350
00:20:55,766 --> 00:20:57,825
October's almost over.

351
00:20:58,202 --> 00:21:00,432
We can start midnight...

352
00:21:00,638 --> 00:21:02,367
...first of November.

353
00:21:02,573 --> 00:21:06,532
If you're brave enough to commit,
I'll devote myself entirely to you.

354
00:21:08,045 --> 00:21:11,071
Brave enough, but not stupid enough.

355
00:21:11,382 --> 00:21:13,441
Now listen up, moonbeam.

356
00:21:13,651 --> 00:21:14,845
Here's how it works.

357
00:21:15,452 --> 00:21:17,477
No more harassment. No more rides.

358
00:21:17,688 --> 00:21:19,087
No more extortion.

359
00:21:19,423 --> 00:21:21,482
Next time you come into my building...

360
00:21:21,926 --> 00:21:23,917
...l really will call the cops.

361
00:21:38,309 --> 00:21:40,243
This is your image, Mr. Leach.

362
00:21:40,778 --> 00:21:42,712
We polled your primary demographic.

363
00:21:43,013 --> 00:21:44,878
I Know what 89 percent said?

364
00:21:45,216 --> 00:21:46,444
"Boring."

365
00:21:46,817 --> 00:21:48,284
"Safe."

366
00:21:51,689 --> 00:21:53,680
We need to drop a bomb.

367
00:21:53,924 --> 00:21:56,859
You don't want hot dogs "safe."

368
00:21:57,261 --> 00:21:58,626
What's in a hot dog?

369
00:21:58,829 --> 00:22:01,093
Don't tell me. I don't want to know.

370
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,767
They're dangerous.

371
00:22:05,569 --> 00:22:07,036
What are we selling here?

372
00:22:07,238 --> 00:22:10,207
We're selling temptation, desire...

373
00:22:10,407 --> 00:22:11,874
...animal instincts...

374
00:22:12,276 --> 00:22:13,971
...gluttony, sin.

375
00:22:14,578 --> 00:22:17,172
We want to show man as he really is.

376
00:22:17,381 --> 00:22:18,439
A savage.

377
00:22:19,049 --> 00:22:20,812
He needs fire. He needs food.

378
00:22:21,085 --> 00:22:22,382
He hunts and gathers.

379
00:22:22,586 --> 00:22:23,951
What does he get?

380
00:22:25,389 --> 00:22:26,720
He gets a hot dog.

381
00:22:27,091 --> 00:22:28,217
We're pagans.

382
00:22:28,425 --> 00:22:29,619
We love our rituals.

383
00:22:29,827 --> 00:22:32,387
Our team hits a home run,
we're screaming.

384
00:22:32,596 --> 00:22:34,029
What do we want?

385
00:22:35,032 --> 00:22:36,192
We want a hot dog.

386
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,834
Let's go to your
preteen demographic.

387
00:22:39,203 --> 00:22:40,932
Kids, the little angels.

388
00:22:41,138 --> 00:22:43,072
They're not. They're monsters.

389
00:22:43,274 --> 00:22:46,710
We give them a tuna sandwich,
they don't want a tuna sandwich.

390
00:22:46,911 --> 00:22:49,311
They want a hot dog!

391
00:22:50,114 --> 00:22:51,274
We need women.

392
00:22:51,482 --> 00:22:52,676
We've got the mothers...

393
00:22:53,517 --> 00:22:54,848
...we want their daughters.

394
00:22:55,219 --> 00:22:57,983
Let's ask that age-old question:

395
00:22:58,188 --> 00:23:00,884
"What does a woman really want?"

396
00:23:01,225 --> 00:23:02,214
You know.

397
00:23:02,426 --> 00:23:03,586
I know.

398
00:23:04,795 --> 00:23:06,285
She wants a hot dog.

399
00:23:06,697 --> 00:23:08,665
We're hot-blooded. We need sex!

400
00:23:08,866 --> 00:23:11,494
We need a sinful, dangerous food!

401
00:23:11,702 --> 00:23:13,169
What is it?

402
00:23:14,138 --> 00:23:16,163
It's a hot dog!

403
00:23:16,607 --> 00:23:18,575
It's a hot dog!

404
00:23:18,776 --> 00:23:21,040
It's a hot dog!

405
00:23:22,246 --> 00:23:23,338
It's a hot dog.

406
00:23:23,547 --> 00:23:26,812
"Dr. Diggity. It's a hot dog."

407
00:23:37,528 --> 00:23:38,517
No.

408
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,826
No?

409
00:23:44,935 --> 00:23:45,993
What do you mean?

410
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,131
It's not for us.

411
00:23:48,339 --> 00:23:51,035
You don't understand our company.

412
00:23:51,241 --> 00:23:53,106
I don't understand?

413
00:23:56,413 --> 00:23:58,210
What did you ask us for?

414
00:23:58,582 --> 00:23:59,674
Edge.

415
00:23:59,917 --> 00:24:02,044
This is edge.

416
00:24:02,386 --> 00:24:04,820
We're going with Baker Bohanon.

417
00:24:05,022 --> 00:24:07,081
I think you're making a mistake.

418
00:24:08,058 --> 00:24:10,652
I've seen your sales.
You're in big trouble.

419
00:24:11,028 --> 00:24:14,828
Oh, no. We are America's
favorite hot dog, son.

420
00:24:15,099 --> 00:24:16,930
Were. Were.

421
00:24:17,267 --> 00:24:18,427
You're a dinosaur.

422
00:24:18,902 --> 00:24:20,927
You're flat-lining.

423
00:24:22,072 --> 00:24:23,471
You're dead meat.

424
00:24:23,674 --> 00:24:26,142
And you just went too far,
you little punk.

425
00:24:26,343 --> 00:24:29,141
So I'll tell you
what I really think of your campaign.

426
00:24:29,346 --> 00:24:31,610
This is cheap, tasteless crap.

427
00:24:31,815 --> 00:24:32,804
Really?

428
00:24:33,017 --> 00:24:35,212
That's funny,
because so is your product.

429
00:24:35,419 --> 00:24:36,249
Stop it.

430
00:24:36,453 --> 00:24:38,751
I make a wholesome hot dog, you prick.

431
00:24:38,956 --> 00:24:40,218
It's mystery meat.

432
00:24:40,424 --> 00:24:43,484
-Come on, Nelson!
-It's toxic waste in a tube!

433
00:24:43,994 --> 00:24:45,461
You're killing me!

434
00:24:45,662 --> 00:24:48,187
You're killing us!
You're killing all of us!

435
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:49,866
Mr. Leach! Hey, buddy!

436
00:24:55,472 --> 00:24:57,997
What the hell happened in there?

437
00:24:58,208 --> 00:24:59,232
I know.

438
00:24:59,443 --> 00:25:00,933
Can you believe that asshole?

439
00:25:01,145 --> 00:25:03,113
Baker Bohanon.

440
00:25:05,883 --> 00:25:08,511
I've always said you're brilliant.
A machine.

441
00:25:08,719 --> 00:25:11,779
But I knew one day you'd snap,
and we'd all burn.

442
00:25:12,322 --> 00:25:14,256
What are you talking about, burn?

443
00:25:14,458 --> 00:25:17,723
You know what was at stake?
How many millions you lost?

444
00:25:18,262 --> 00:25:21,356
You just dragged my agency's name
through the gutter.

445
00:25:21,565 --> 00:25:22,862
Hold on a second.

446
00:25:23,067 --> 00:25:24,159
Gutter?

447
00:25:24,368 --> 00:25:26,359
I'm the best thing this agency's got.

448
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:29,771
And that rabid dog routine
makes you the best?

449
00:25:29,973 --> 00:25:31,998
I don't think so.
It makes you a wreck!

450
00:25:32,209 --> 00:25:34,473
It makes you a liability.

451
00:25:35,446 --> 00:25:37,346
You need a vacation. Now.

452
00:25:37,548 --> 00:25:38,981
Screw vacation.

453
00:25:39,183 --> 00:25:41,515
Give me another account. Come on.

454
00:25:41,985 --> 00:25:44,283
Nelson, did you hear me?

455
00:25:44,488 --> 00:25:45,750
Take a vacation.

456
00:25:46,356 --> 00:25:48,881
Short or permanent, your choice.

457
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,727
Are you threatening me?

458
00:25:54,731 --> 00:25:56,392
That's hilarious.

459
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,194
I'm two Clio's ahead of the game, Ray.

460
00:25:59,403 --> 00:26:01,598
You can't afford to lose me.

461
00:26:02,139 --> 00:26:03,265
You're fired.

462
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:05,864
Say that again.

463
00:26:08,378 --> 00:26:10,209
I don't think I heard you.

464
00:26:10,314 --> 00:26:11,747
You're fired!

465
00:26:33,036 --> 00:26:34,333
God, am l...

466
00:26:34,538 --> 00:26:35,835
...glad to see you.

467
00:26:39,676 --> 00:26:42,008
You've got to be kidding me.

468
00:27:06,203 --> 00:27:07,693
Mr. Moss?

469
00:27:08,238 --> 00:27:09,933
Are you doing okay?

470
00:27:10,574 --> 00:27:11,563
I'm fine.

471
00:27:11,975 --> 00:27:13,602
You have a deliv--

472
00:27:15,245 --> 00:27:17,213
You have delivery.

473
00:27:18,916 --> 00:27:22,352
-Leave it!
-I do not think you want me do that.

474
00:27:22,653 --> 00:27:25,247
It's from the crazy lady
from the other night.

475
00:27:25,455 --> 00:27:27,719
She tell me I have to deliver
in the flesh.

476
00:27:27,925 --> 00:27:29,256
I said, leave it!

477
00:27:29,826 --> 00:27:31,191
Okay.

478
00:27:55,586 --> 00:27:58,020
You've got to be kidding me.

479
00:28:07,064 --> 00:28:08,122
Hey!

480
00:28:08,532 --> 00:28:11,467
Do me a favor. Stay out of my life.

481
00:28:11,668 --> 00:28:12,794
Goodbye.

482
00:28:13,003 --> 00:28:14,163
Is that Ernie?

483
00:28:14,371 --> 00:28:15,804
It's Ernie!

484
00:28:16,006 --> 00:28:18,304
I missed you so much! Hi.

485
00:28:18,508 --> 00:28:20,032
Did you rethink my offer?

486
00:28:20,244 --> 00:28:23,304
I don't feel like playing
the Deever Mad Hatter game.

487
00:28:23,513 --> 00:28:24,707
What is this?

488
00:28:24,915 --> 00:28:26,780
-What happened?
-Nothing.

489
00:28:26,984 --> 00:28:29,544
-Can I look at it?
-Why?

490
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,088
Because I'm a vampire.

491
00:28:34,391 --> 00:28:35,722
Because it's bleeding.

492
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:39,825
And maybe....
Maybe I can help you.

493
00:28:41,431 --> 00:28:43,831
What are you after?
What do you want from me?

494
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:47,803
You should come with me.

495
00:28:49,172 --> 00:28:51,470
Why are you sending me dogs?

496
00:28:56,313 --> 00:28:59,043
So, what did you do today?

497
00:28:59,416 --> 00:29:01,213
What did I do today?

498
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,712
I got fired.

499
00:29:05,222 --> 00:29:07,190
They took the company car...

500
00:29:07,891 --> 00:29:09,859
...and my girlfriend left me.

501
00:29:11,161 --> 00:29:12,150
Perfect.

502
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:14,992
Define "perfect."

503
00:29:15,365 --> 00:29:16,662
Well...

504
00:29:17,534 --> 00:29:19,229
...it's the first of November.

505
00:29:19,436 --> 00:29:21,370
Our month to be together.

506
00:29:21,872 --> 00:29:24,102
You're actually serious about this.

507
00:29:24,308 --> 00:29:25,536
Oh, yeah. Very.

508
00:29:25,942 --> 00:29:28,877
You think I'm just gonna
drop everything?

509
00:29:30,914 --> 00:29:34,941
I don't want to bust your bubble,
but it sounds like you already have.

510
00:29:35,152 --> 00:29:36,813
Live here...

511
00:29:37,187 --> 00:29:39,917
...and let you mess with my head
for a whole month?

512
00:29:40,991 --> 00:29:43,459
I don't know if I would
put it that way...

513
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:46,026
...but yeah, I think you should.

514
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,857
I'm sorry, I can't stand watches.

515
00:29:50,867 --> 00:29:52,198
So this...

516
00:29:52,402 --> 00:29:53,892
...whatever you call it--

517
00:29:54,104 --> 00:29:56,538
-Help.
-"Help."

518
00:29:58,175 --> 00:29:59,608
What are you doing?

519
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:01,209
Taking your shirt off.

520
00:30:01,411 --> 00:30:02,537
Why?

521
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,511
So you can clean up.

522
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:08,042
Why?

523
00:30:11,054 --> 00:30:13,579
Because you smell like puppy pee.

524
00:30:38,315 --> 00:30:39,976
Just for the night.

525
00:31:50,387 --> 00:31:51,854
Whoa. Hey.

526
00:31:52,055 --> 00:31:53,386
Okay.

527
00:31:53,857 --> 00:31:54,949
What?

528
00:31:57,093 --> 00:31:58,890
Slow, you know.

529
00:32:00,163 --> 00:32:01,187
Yeah.

530
00:32:03,733 --> 00:32:05,200
Gentle.

531
00:32:06,837 --> 00:32:08,327
Look at me.

532
00:32:24,921 --> 00:32:27,446
This is not very comfortable.

533
00:32:28,925 --> 00:32:31,223
Wait, what are you doing?

534
00:32:31,928 --> 00:32:33,725
What does it look like I'm doing?

535
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:36,091
Wait, just go slow.

536
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,726
Just--

537
00:32:38,335 --> 00:32:40,860
What's wrong? What's wrong?

538
00:32:42,172 --> 00:32:44,640
-Where are you going?
-To hell with this!

539
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:46,342
But, wait--

540
00:32:51,081 --> 00:32:52,810
Please wait!

541
00:32:54,684 --> 00:32:56,914
Will you just wait a second?

542
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,453
I have no words to describe
how positively wacked you are.

543
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:04,421
-What are you so pissed off about?
-This has been the day from hell.

544
00:33:04,694 --> 00:33:07,629
I don't need you telling me
what to do in the sack!

545
00:33:07,831 --> 00:33:10,197
-I didn't mean to. I just--
-Just what?

546
00:33:10,433 --> 00:33:13,368
Making sure your game
was going according to plan?

547
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:15,765
-It's not a game.
-Really?

548
00:33:15,972 --> 00:33:17,599
Then just what is it exactly?

549
00:33:17,807 --> 00:33:19,331
I'm trying to help you.

550
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:22,439
I don't need help.

551
00:33:23,747 --> 00:33:26,375
It doesn't get much sweeter than this.

552
00:33:26,583 --> 00:33:29,074
What I'm offering
is a win-win situation.

553
00:33:29,286 --> 00:33:31,550
Yeah? And what do you get out of it?

554
00:33:32,689 --> 00:33:34,623
I get to help you.

555
00:33:37,193 --> 00:33:39,423
I don't understand you.
This whole thing--

556
00:33:39,629 --> 00:33:41,722
You don't need to understand me.

557
00:33:42,265 --> 00:33:44,256
You just need to let it happen.

558
00:33:45,802 --> 00:33:47,997
Please, don't go.

559
00:33:49,906 --> 00:33:50,895
Why not?

560
00:33:51,341 --> 00:33:53,275
Because I know you don't want to.

561
00:34:02,385 --> 00:34:05,912
Have you ever considered
a career in sales?

562
00:34:08,825 --> 00:34:09,814
No.

563
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,193
Well, you should.

564
00:34:12,862 --> 00:34:14,454
You're relentless.

565
00:34:52,669 --> 00:34:54,159
Nelson...

566
00:34:55,238 --> 00:34:57,604
...would you like to be my November?

567
00:34:58,341 --> 00:34:59,501
Yes.

568
00:35:50,794 --> 00:35:52,455
-What's your name?
-Raquel.

569
00:35:52,662 --> 00:35:54,493
That's a beautiful name.

570
00:35:54,698 --> 00:35:57,599
Could you put an extra shot
of chocolate in my mocha?

571
00:35:57,801 --> 00:36:00,099
Chocolate's an aphrodisiac.
Did you know that?

572
00:36:00,303 --> 00:36:02,134
You look great in that smock.
Yeah.

573
00:36:02,338 --> 00:36:04,772
-Vince.
-Where are you? I've been calling--

574
00:36:04,974 --> 00:36:06,737
-Edgar Price.
-Edgar Price?

575
00:36:06,943 --> 00:36:09,707
-Edgar Price.
-Edgar Price. What, what, what?

576
00:36:09,913 --> 00:36:13,076
-Can you get us a meeting?
-You and me?

577
00:36:13,583 --> 00:36:16,484
You and me.
Edgar Price's new company.

578
00:36:16,786 --> 00:36:19,687
-Game?
-That's brilliant. That's genius.

579
00:36:19,889 --> 00:36:22,881
I'll do that. They stuck
me with that loser, John Heedley.

580
00:36:23,093 --> 00:36:25,220
-Can't go on like this.
-Vince?

581
00:36:26,096 --> 00:36:27,859
-Call me with news.
-Absolutely.

582
00:36:28,064 --> 00:36:28,894
Hey!

583
00:36:32,535 --> 00:36:35,663
-Stop what you're doing, right now.
-Why?

584
00:36:36,506 --> 00:36:41,034
Because it's the same boring thing
you do every day of your life.

585
00:36:41,578 --> 00:36:43,546
And you can't do that with me.

586
00:36:44,914 --> 00:36:46,745
What's wrong with your TV?

587
00:36:48,184 --> 00:36:49,412
Good morning.

588
00:36:49,686 --> 00:36:50,812
It doesn't work.

589
00:36:51,187 --> 00:36:53,382
Of course it doesn't. It's a planter.

590
00:36:54,457 --> 00:36:55,446
Right.

591
00:36:58,228 --> 00:37:01,095
-Where are my clothes?
-I gave them away.

592
00:37:02,398 --> 00:37:03,296
You what?

593
00:37:04,834 --> 00:37:06,233
I gave them away.

594
00:37:07,637 --> 00:37:08,763
Oh, but...

595
00:37:11,141 --> 00:37:12,130
...look at this.

596
00:37:15,879 --> 00:37:18,006
Oh, yeah, baby!

597
00:37:18,448 --> 00:37:20,643
Freedom. No more suits.

598
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:23,679
I got you those.

599
00:37:24,521 --> 00:37:28,116
Sara, this is not helpful.
Give me my shirt and pants back.

600
00:37:28,491 --> 00:37:30,288
What? It's clothes.

601
00:37:30,493 --> 00:37:33,326
It's just gonna cover your body.
What do you care?

602
00:37:35,999 --> 00:37:38,365
Hey, do you like cheese?

603
00:37:38,735 --> 00:37:41,533
Hey there, Ernie. Hi!

604
00:37:41,738 --> 00:37:46,300
Ernie, are you sad?
Do you miss your brother?

605
00:37:46,509 --> 00:37:49,842
You'll stay with me until we find you
some decent parents.

606
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,147
Hey, by the way, when do I get
to meet your parents?

607
00:37:53,516 --> 00:37:55,143
My parents are dead.

608
00:37:57,487 --> 00:37:58,579
I'm sorry.

609
00:37:59,756 --> 00:38:03,214
Sara, I'm not amused.
I want my clothes back. Now.

610
00:38:03,426 --> 00:38:06,259
I told you, I gave them away.

611
00:38:08,598 --> 00:38:12,090
I promise, I'll never lie to you.

612
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:16,828
So...

613
00:38:18,174 --> 00:38:22,611
...would you like vegan sausage,
vegan bacon....

614
00:38:22,812 --> 00:38:24,609
That's all we got now.
Huh?

615
00:38:25,014 --> 00:38:28,848
I make it with a lot of vegan butter
so it gets nice and black and crispy.

616
00:38:29,052 --> 00:38:32,681
But if you don't like it that way,
I won't make it that way, okay?

617
00:38:32,889 --> 00:38:34,379
Hey, hey.

618
00:38:35,491 --> 00:38:37,322
Three hours sleep last night.

619
00:38:37,894 --> 00:38:42,524
Tried valerian root, melatonin,
the Shopping Channel.

620
00:38:44,067 --> 00:38:45,466
You know what did the trick?

621
00:38:45,668 --> 00:38:47,260
-What?
-Jimmy Cagney.

622
00:38:48,137 --> 00:38:51,004
Public Enemy.
Violence as a tranquilizer.

623
00:38:51,207 --> 00:38:52,902
How twisted is that?

624
00:38:57,881 --> 00:39:00,247
You're looking very sexy today.

625
00:39:00,617 --> 00:39:02,278
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

626
00:39:02,619 --> 00:39:03,608
Wow.

627
00:39:05,822 --> 00:39:08,950
I do believe that is
my favorite sweatshirt I see.

628
00:39:11,527 --> 00:39:13,119
You must be November.

629
00:39:13,463 --> 00:39:14,623
I must be November?

630
00:39:15,598 --> 00:39:16,792
That's Nelson.

631
00:39:18,401 --> 00:39:21,131
Hey, Nelson. How are you?

632
00:39:21,337 --> 00:39:23,601
-I'm Chaz.
-Hey.

633
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,338
You know what?

634
00:39:26,209 --> 00:39:29,110
I Keep the sweatshirt.
It looks better on you.

635
00:39:29,746 --> 00:39:34,513
Is this some kind of a communal-culty-
squeaky-Charlie type of deal?

636
00:39:34,851 --> 00:39:37,115
That's very good. He's really funny.

637
00:39:37,787 --> 00:39:40,551
Much cooler than October.
A lot of good he was.

638
00:39:40,757 --> 00:39:42,019
I gotta go.

639
00:39:43,493 --> 00:39:44,960
-I love you, baby.
-I love you.

640
00:39:45,762 --> 00:39:49,198
-You sure you don't want any food?
-And get fat like you?

641
00:39:51,701 --> 00:39:54,295
-See you around, Nelson.
-See you.

642
00:39:58,408 --> 00:40:01,844
I think I'll pull myself out
of monthly rotation while I'm ahead.

643
00:40:02,845 --> 00:40:05,040
What? Nelson.

644
00:40:06,282 --> 00:40:08,773
-Who the hell was that, your pimp?
-Chaz?

645
00:40:08,985 --> 00:40:11,385
Chaz lives downstairs.
We look after each other.

646
00:40:11,587 --> 00:40:13,612
I think Chaz can take care of himself.

647
00:40:13,823 --> 00:40:15,381
He just needs a good night's sleep.

648
00:40:15,591 --> 00:40:18,685
-Hi, sweetheart, how are you?
-Hey, guys. Nelson....

649
00:40:18,895 --> 00:40:19,884
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

650
00:40:20,096 --> 00:40:23,293
I was trying to introduce you.
That's AI and Osiris.

651
00:40:23,533 --> 00:40:24,898
They own that bookstore.

652
00:40:25,101 --> 00:40:27,296
They used to be friends
with Jack Kerouac.

653
00:40:27,503 --> 00:40:28,800
I don't care. I don't read.

654
00:40:29,005 --> 00:40:31,235
Sara, can you spare 1 5 bucks?

655
00:40:31,507 --> 00:40:34,476
Bruce, I gave you those clothes.
Why are you so greedy?

656
00:40:36,045 --> 00:40:38,479
That's my shirt! Those are my pants!

657
00:40:39,682 --> 00:40:42,583
-Doesn't it feel good to give?
-No!

658
00:40:42,885 --> 00:40:46,184
-You November?
-Where am l?

659
00:40:46,389 --> 00:40:47,378
You have to meet.

660
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:50,115
Nelson, this is Abner. Abner, Nelson.

661
00:40:50,326 --> 00:40:52,760
Abner's gonna set
a world record one day.

662
00:40:52,962 --> 00:40:56,454
-What's today's project?
-Standing on one leg. Want to time me?

663
00:40:56,666 --> 00:40:59,032
I have to break
the record of 300 hours.

664
00:41:00,036 --> 00:41:01,765
-No.
-Loser.

665
00:41:02,538 --> 00:41:03,937
Get a life.

666
00:41:05,008 --> 00:41:05,997
Good one.

667
00:41:07,844 --> 00:41:09,812
You let a 10-year-old wind you up?

668
00:41:10,013 --> 00:41:11,981
Forget him. What about you?

669
00:41:12,181 --> 00:41:15,173
You sleep with half the city,
get the whole neighborhood involved.

670
00:41:15,651 --> 00:41:19,985
-You'd prefer if I was a virgin?
-Considering the alternative, yes.

671
00:41:21,391 --> 00:41:23,188
I'm yours.

672
00:41:23,793 --> 00:41:25,624
All yours.

673
00:41:26,295 --> 00:41:28,991
Look, Sara, you're great.

674
00:41:29,198 --> 00:41:34,158
You're a very sexy, smart,
interesting, somewhat unusual woman.

675
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:38,636
But we-- I always think it's best
to clarify issues.

676
00:41:38,841 --> 00:41:41,708
You are the most egotistical man
I've ever met.

677
00:41:42,078 --> 00:41:43,807
I am talking about a month.

678
00:41:44,547 --> 00:41:47,812
The truth is, I don't have a month.
Time is money.

679
00:41:51,988 --> 00:41:56,982
Okay. Let's just--
How long do you think...

680
00:41:57,193 --> 00:42:01,493
...you could put this big, lucrative
career of yours on hold? Just, just--

681
00:42:02,665 --> 00:42:05,395
God, what am I talking about?!
You are unemployed!

682
00:42:06,002 --> 00:42:08,903
You don't have a job!
You got fired, Nelson.

683
00:42:09,105 --> 00:42:12,131
You have nothing to go back to.

684
00:42:13,209 --> 00:42:17,612
This project of yours
feels like an excuse to get laid.

685
00:42:28,024 --> 00:42:30,288
Sara, I'm sorry. I....

686
00:42:30,493 --> 00:42:33,326
Sara, I didn't mean to--
I didn't think you'd--

687
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:36,992
I don't understand why
you're doing this, is all.

688
00:42:39,235 --> 00:42:40,702
I told you.

689
00:42:41,471 --> 00:42:43,098
I have my reasons.

690
00:42:47,743 --> 00:42:49,005
Still friends?

691
00:42:49,545 --> 00:42:51,536
Only if you give me what I want.

692
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:55,112
What?

693
00:42:55,451 --> 00:42:56,440
Time.

694
00:42:59,388 --> 00:43:02,186
-All I can do is a day.
-I'll take it.

695
00:43:02,959 --> 00:43:04,085
Okay.

696
00:43:05,228 --> 00:43:06,422
I'll take it.

697
00:43:07,864 --> 00:43:11,766
Always a thrill to explore
new career possibilities.

698
00:43:12,468 --> 00:43:13,901
How much do you charge?

699
00:43:14,137 --> 00:43:16,970
-I don't do this for the money.
-Why do you do it?

700
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,404
I like it.
You can take them off the leashes.

701
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:23,738
Come on. Oh, yes, you're so excited,
I know.

702
00:43:23,946 --> 00:43:25,641
Yeah, you go raise some hell.

703
00:43:25,848 --> 00:43:29,409
Don't tell your mom, okay?
You can let them go, you know, Nelson.

704
00:43:32,855 --> 00:43:34,322
Come on!

705
00:43:37,326 --> 00:43:38,224
Yippee.

706
00:43:44,567 --> 00:43:47,297
Come on. Let's go. Come on!

707
00:44:34,784 --> 00:44:36,684
Get off me!

708
00:44:45,027 --> 00:44:48,292
So when was the last time you
spent a whole day outside?

709
00:44:51,234 --> 00:44:55,000
When my parents dragged me to Alcatraz
for the day at the age of 9.

710
00:44:55,204 --> 00:44:56,330
Wow.

711
00:44:57,406 --> 00:44:59,601
-Now you tell me something.
-Anything.

712
00:44:59,809 --> 00:45:02,642
What was so enlightening
about what we did today?

713
00:45:02,845 --> 00:45:06,838
Why is letting some dogs go wild
a better way to live than my way?

714
00:45:07,049 --> 00:45:11,782
Granted, it was mildly amusing,
but my third eye didn't open.

715
00:45:11,988 --> 00:45:13,922
Well, these things take time.

716
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:16,315
And you don't have time.

717
00:45:16,525 --> 00:45:18,891
No, seriously.
It's a question of values.

718
00:45:19,095 --> 00:45:22,223
Why is doing something fundamentally
trivial better...

719
00:45:22,431 --> 00:45:24,661
...than living a responsible life?

720
00:45:24,934 --> 00:45:26,959
Boring as that might seem to you.

721
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:31,331
And who made you the expert,
the doctor, the guru?

722
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:33,633
Why do you have all the answers?

723
00:45:33,843 --> 00:45:37,870
Well, I used to own this company
called Sublime Pets.

724
00:45:38,748 --> 00:45:40,807
No, I really did.

725
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:43,917
And then I quit.
It wasn't fun anymore, you know.

726
00:45:44,654 --> 00:45:47,589
Before or after you toured
as a standup comedian?

727
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:49,314
I never did that.

728
00:45:52,295 --> 00:45:53,421
Well, this....

729
00:45:54,196 --> 00:45:56,357
This would be really good for you.

730
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,834
Sharpen your instincts.

731
00:46:01,003 --> 00:46:02,971
No, no.

732
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:05,971
Not those kind of instincts.

733
00:46:06,642 --> 00:46:10,738
So the object of the game--
Get your hands off me.

734
00:46:11,914 --> 00:46:15,680
I run around.
You lose track of me. Then you--

735
00:46:15,885 --> 00:46:19,321
No, no peeking. Hands off.

736
00:46:19,522 --> 00:46:21,046
Count to 10...

737
00:46:21,624 --> 00:46:23,182
...then come find me.

738
00:46:28,664 --> 00:46:30,825
One, two, three-- I'm gonna get you.

739
00:46:31,033 --> 00:46:32,933
Four, five, six--
I know where you are.

740
00:46:33,135 --> 00:46:34,432
Seven, eight, nine, ten.

741
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:03,460
Oh, Nelson, that was terrible.

742
00:47:03,666 --> 00:47:05,634
You didn't even get close.

743
00:47:05,835 --> 00:47:07,200
This is funny?

744
00:47:07,737 --> 00:47:10,535
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

745
00:47:13,576 --> 00:47:17,376
Sara, you're not going to be upset
when I leave tonight?

746
00:47:17,913 --> 00:47:19,574
I told you one day.

747
00:47:21,217 --> 00:47:22,149
Yeah, of course.

748
00:47:26,261 --> 00:47:28,195
Mitch was my October.

749
00:47:32,467 --> 00:47:34,128
He was so shy.

750
00:47:34,336 --> 00:47:36,896
I think he was the shyest man
I've ever met.

751
00:47:37,639 --> 00:47:38,628
So...

752
00:47:40,108 --> 00:47:43,544
...we focused on strengthening
his confidence.

753
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:47,540
And was the patient cured?

754
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:50,039
Oh, yeah.

755
00:47:51,486 --> 00:47:54,717
My treatment was so effective...

756
00:47:54,923 --> 00:47:58,415
...that we had to terminate
the month early.

757
00:47:59,995 --> 00:48:01,724
And what about September?

758
00:48:03,698 --> 00:48:05,529
No. No September.

759
00:48:08,436 --> 00:48:09,425
What?

760
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:13,970
You didn't think I was weird
about it, did you?

761
00:48:17,145 --> 00:48:19,807
And you and all these guys...?

762
00:48:21,416 --> 00:48:23,145
Does it matter that much to you?

763
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:27,144
Why a month?

764
00:48:27,722 --> 00:48:32,489
It's long enough to be meaningful and
short enough to stay out of trouble.

765
00:48:39,134 --> 00:48:40,499
It was delicious.

766
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:42,659
Thanks.

767
00:48:44,606 --> 00:48:46,164
It's getting late.

768
00:48:51,513 --> 00:48:54,209
Don't worry about this.
I'll clean it up.

769
00:48:56,818 --> 00:48:58,843
What are you gonna do
when you go home?

770
00:49:01,156 --> 00:49:02,453
I don't know.

771
00:49:02,791 --> 00:49:06,955
I don't usually map out my evenings.

772
00:49:08,129 --> 00:49:09,653
You're gonna go home.

773
00:49:10,565 --> 00:49:12,123
Turn on your TV.

774
00:49:13,468 --> 00:49:14,867
Get bored.

775
00:49:16,371 --> 00:49:18,430
Turn on your computer.

776
00:49:20,208 --> 00:49:23,200
Go through your work. Get bored.

777
00:49:24,312 --> 00:49:25,301
Surf the net.

778
00:49:30,252 --> 00:49:31,480
Get bored.

779
00:49:33,121 --> 00:49:34,281
And think of me.

780
00:50:14,329 --> 00:50:15,318
Ernie.

781
00:50:20,969 --> 00:50:23,199
Try to be wrong once in a while.

782
00:50:23,438 --> 00:50:25,201
It'll do my ego good.

783
00:50:36,151 --> 00:50:41,145
-I don't see why we didn't take a cab.
-Because I make the rules, Nelson.

784
00:50:41,356 --> 00:50:44,689
Rules you must submit to,
utterly and completely.

785
00:50:45,527 --> 00:50:47,654
If you want to be
a dominatrix that bad...

786
00:50:47,862 --> 00:50:50,854
...why don't we buy you
the leather and get it over with?

787
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,664
I think I'm strangely aroused.

788
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:03,735
That's Abner.

789
00:51:05,146 --> 00:51:06,306
Hi.

790
00:51:08,249 --> 00:51:09,238
Is that you?

791
00:51:11,319 --> 00:51:14,755
He's got a face. It's a good one too.

792
00:51:15,023 --> 00:51:16,547
-Did you wait long?
-No.

793
00:51:16,758 --> 00:51:18,020
Good.

794
00:51:19,627 --> 00:51:21,060
What is that? You didn't.

795
00:51:21,262 --> 00:51:23,321
-You did not bring that!
-What can I say?

796
00:51:23,531 --> 00:51:25,726
-Yeah?
-Just call me genius, I don't mind.

797
00:51:25,934 --> 00:51:27,925
-What up, Vince?
-"What up"?

798
00:51:28,136 --> 00:51:33,130
You, me, Edgar Price, November 1 7th,
Friday. That's what up.

799
00:51:33,375 --> 00:51:34,603
I'm your rainmaker.

800
00:51:34,809 --> 00:51:37,369
-You're a genius.
-It's about time you said so.

801
00:51:37,579 --> 00:51:39,706
I heard about Angelica. I'm sorry.

802
00:51:39,914 --> 00:51:42,542
As much as I knew,
she wasn't right for you.

803
00:51:42,751 --> 00:51:46,312
-So do I smell new female friend?
-What makes you say that?

804
00:51:46,521 --> 00:51:48,045
You don't return my calls.

805
00:51:48,256 --> 00:51:50,816
There's estrogen in the air.
Don't insult me.

806
00:51:51,026 --> 00:51:52,493
Come on, who is she?

807
00:51:54,062 --> 00:51:56,860
-You wouldn't know her.
-But would I despise her?

808
00:51:57,065 --> 00:52:00,728
That's the question. On a scale of
9 to 10, is she a 9 or a 10?

809
00:52:00,935 --> 00:52:04,427
Listen, I gotta run.
Great news on the Edgar Price thing.

810
00:52:05,006 --> 00:52:06,735
Go launch it, okay?

811
00:52:11,312 --> 00:52:13,906
Oh, that's really cool. Not.

812
00:52:14,115 --> 00:52:16,549
What is it, Pokemon's dinghy?

813
00:52:20,321 --> 00:52:23,119
All right, let's do this.
All boats in the water.

814
00:52:23,324 --> 00:52:27,385
-Except for this kid's.
-That's not a kid, that's a girl.

815
00:52:30,665 --> 00:52:33,600
-Maybe I should forget about it.
-Just ignore them, Abner.

816
00:52:33,802 --> 00:52:34,962
Abner?

817
00:52:35,170 --> 00:52:36,330
Abner?

818
00:52:39,974 --> 00:52:41,464
Hang in there, Ab.

819
00:52:41,876 --> 00:52:43,207
All boats in the water.

820
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:50,244
Let's do this.

821
00:53:03,198 --> 00:53:05,029
Say your prayers, Abner!

822
00:53:14,476 --> 00:53:16,000
Go, Abner!

823
00:53:24,786 --> 00:53:26,219
Go, Abner!

824
00:53:40,969 --> 00:53:42,766
Go, Abner!

825
00:53:45,607 --> 00:53:46,835
Excuse me.

826
00:53:48,743 --> 00:53:51,268
-You want to make a hundred bucks?
-Sure.

827
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:13,531
Come on, Abner! Come on!

828
00:54:53,641 --> 00:54:55,108
Hey, my boat's all--

829
00:54:59,914 --> 00:55:00,938
What's going on?

830
00:55:16,764 --> 00:55:17,992
Straight. Straight!

831
00:55:18,199 --> 00:55:19,666
Come on, you can do it!

832
00:55:25,139 --> 00:55:26,231
I guess I'm winning.

833
00:55:26,441 --> 00:55:31,276
-That little creep is cheating.
-No, I'm not. My boat's just better.

834
00:55:34,249 --> 00:55:35,307
Go, Abner!

835
00:55:49,864 --> 00:55:51,126
I guess I won.

836
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:58,264
That was fun. Next time
can we do it with cars?

837
00:55:58,473 --> 00:55:59,599
-Sure.
-No.

838
00:56:01,342 --> 00:56:02,934
-Bye.
-See you, Abner.

839
00:56:03,144 --> 00:56:05,271
-Good night.
-Good night.

840
00:56:09,217 --> 00:56:11,708
You know, that was really nice
what you did today.

841
00:56:12,387 --> 00:56:13,547
Thanks.

842
00:56:13,988 --> 00:56:17,151
-But it's not gonna help him.
-What do you mean?

843
00:56:17,358 --> 00:56:19,121
He's gonna have a lot of obstacles...

844
00:56:19,327 --> 00:56:21,318
...and he has to learn
to deal with them.

845
00:56:21,529 --> 00:56:24,104
Those kids were laughing at him.
You ever been laughed at?

846
00:56:25,929 --> 00:56:28,727
Okay, cheating's bad, I guess.

847
00:56:28,932 --> 00:56:30,900
You're a father figure now.

848
00:56:31,101 --> 00:56:33,126
Get out of here. The kid just met me.

849
00:56:33,337 --> 00:56:36,135
When you don't know your dad,
you're not picky.

850
00:56:37,274 --> 00:56:40,732
Look at that, Nelson. That's life.

851
00:56:40,944 --> 00:56:44,277
It's just happening around us
all the time.

852
00:56:45,315 --> 00:56:47,306
I think that's so beautiful.

853
00:56:53,090 --> 00:56:54,955
Tell me your secret dream.

854
00:56:55,793 --> 00:56:57,488
I'm not much on that kind of thing.

855
00:56:57,694 --> 00:57:00,959
Oh, come on. Everybody's got one.

856
00:57:01,732 --> 00:57:06,465
One they only tell after
a couple of drinks. Tell me.

857
00:57:08,405 --> 00:57:11,772
My father sold door-to-door.

858
00:57:11,975 --> 00:57:14,443
Vacuum cleaners, life insurance.

859
00:57:14,645 --> 00:57:16,806
For a while he even sold plastic food.

860
00:57:17,214 --> 00:57:20,047
We were kind of the joke
of the neighborhood.

861
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:24,516
And believe me, the neighborhood
was a pretty grim joke itself.

862
00:57:24,721 --> 00:57:26,552
-Where'd you grow up?
-Right here.

863
00:57:26,757 --> 00:57:31,558
I still own the house,
but I never go there.

864
00:57:33,163 --> 00:57:34,562
Anyway...

865
00:57:35,966 --> 00:57:39,493
...every night after dinner,
he would...

866
00:57:40,437 --> 00:57:42,871
...shut himself in the TV room...

867
00:57:44,074 --> 00:57:45,803
...and listen to 45s:

868
00:57:46,443 --> 00:57:49,844
Bobby Darin, Perry Como,
Tony Bennett.

869
00:57:51,949 --> 00:57:53,712
For a year or so...

870
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:59,384
...l desperately wanted
to be a singer.

871
00:58:01,191 --> 00:58:03,056
You thought it would make him happy?

872
00:58:04,561 --> 00:58:05,721
No.

873
00:58:07,431 --> 00:58:09,422
I thought those guys...

874
00:58:10,667 --> 00:58:12,931
...were everything he wasn't.

875
00:58:14,838 --> 00:58:17,807
Successful, proud...

876
00:58:18,976 --> 00:58:20,273
...in control.

877
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:24,704
I'd like to hear you sing.

878
00:58:25,949 --> 00:58:28,679
That will never happen.

879
00:58:31,288 --> 00:58:33,017
Come on. One day.

880
00:58:33,624 --> 00:58:36,149
One day you'll sing for me, right?

881
00:58:37,628 --> 00:58:38,993
What are we doing?

882
00:58:40,430 --> 00:58:42,591
The movie starts in 10 minutes.
Should we skip it?

883
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:47,031
I'll get you a cappuccino.
I can find a cappuccino. Relax.

884
00:58:52,242 --> 00:58:54,233
I hope that I can eat all of this.

885
00:58:54,811 --> 00:58:56,802
Oh, my God!

886
00:58:57,047 --> 00:59:01,211
Somebody went domestic on me.
Okay. Well, okay.

887
00:59:01,418 --> 00:59:05,582
I get it. It all makes sense.
Mystery woman, unveiled.

888
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:08,682
What kind of Bohemian backwater
is this?

889
00:59:08,892 --> 00:59:10,154
Do they read poetry here?

890
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:13,056
Sara, Vince. Vince, Sara.

891
00:59:13,497 --> 00:59:15,590
-Hey.
-Very nice to meet you.

892
00:59:16,967 --> 00:59:19,629
-I gotta go.
-Was it something I said?

893
00:59:19,836 --> 00:59:21,531
Vince, the movie.

894
00:59:21,738 --> 00:59:23,968
Oh, that's my good friend, um....

895
00:59:25,676 --> 00:59:27,507
What, you can't remember her name?

896
00:59:27,778 --> 00:59:31,544
She doesn't care as long as I
remember to pick up the check, right?

897
00:59:31,748 --> 00:59:33,477
That's incredible.

898
00:59:33,684 --> 00:59:37,085
I mean that is, I think,
the most astute observation...

899
00:59:37,287 --> 00:59:40,484
...of female behavior I've ever heard.

900
00:59:40,691 --> 00:59:42,818
She's funny. You're funny.
That's funny.

901
00:59:43,026 --> 00:59:46,189
This is my very good friend Nelson,
and his very good friend....

902
00:59:47,531 --> 00:59:49,965
-Tell me.
-Sara.

903
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:51,927
-Hi. Lexy.
-Hi, nice to meet you.

904
00:59:52,135 --> 00:59:53,500
Lexy, Sara. Sara, Lexy.

905
00:59:53,704 --> 00:59:56,605
We should all go out sometime,
get drunk and nasty.

906
00:59:56,807 --> 00:59:58,638
Quick order:
one cappuccino to go.

907
00:59:58,842 --> 01:00:00,810
Quick answer:
no quick orders.

908
01:00:01,545 --> 01:00:03,638
We love this place.
We'll be back every day.

909
01:00:03,847 --> 01:00:08,079
I gotta go take care of Lexy.
Remember the 1 7th: you, me and God.

910
01:00:08,352 --> 01:00:12,652
Sara, very nice to meet you.
It was an honor.

911
01:00:12,856 --> 01:00:14,187
Very entertaining.

912
01:00:15,826 --> 01:00:17,259
God! Wow.

913
01:00:18,161 --> 01:00:21,255
We're going to be late,
and it's your fault.

914
01:00:21,632 --> 01:00:23,964
He's actually a good guy, deep down.

915
01:00:24,601 --> 01:00:25,863
Somewhere.

916
01:00:27,037 --> 01:00:28,197
Yeah.

917
01:00:28,538 --> 01:00:31,632
I just mean the glibness...

918
01:00:32,876 --> 01:00:34,935
...kind of wears you out
after a while.

919
01:00:39,783 --> 01:00:41,080
Do you trust him?

920
01:00:41,952 --> 01:00:43,783
Like friends do, you know.

921
01:00:44,321 --> 01:00:47,688
-Do you think he'll be there for you?
-When?

922
01:00:50,861 --> 01:00:53,694
Like a scary situation or something.

923
01:00:56,333 --> 01:00:57,960
You may have noticed...

924
01:00:58,168 --> 01:01:01,831
...l don't put myself
in scary situations.

925
01:01:05,075 --> 01:01:09,603
Hey, you know what? Why don't we go
see that house you grew up in?

926
01:01:09,813 --> 01:01:10,973
Want to do that?

927
01:01:14,251 --> 01:01:16,310
That's not too scary, is it?

928
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:31,224
It's just a house.

929
01:02:06,837 --> 01:02:09,431
I tried so hard not to come back here.

930
01:02:27,324 --> 01:02:28,313
Sorry.

931
01:02:31,128 --> 01:02:32,152
Ouch.

932
01:02:34,898 --> 01:02:35,887
Sara?

933
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,903
I know I don't know a lot of things,
but I do know how to slow dance.

934
01:02:42,339 --> 01:02:43,670
You're terrible.

935
01:02:45,909 --> 01:02:48,377
Here, let me show you.

936
01:03:47,671 --> 01:03:49,798
I looked up your Web site
the other night.

937
01:03:50,373 --> 01:03:53,433
You sister's pretty.
Looks a lot like you.

938
01:03:53,643 --> 01:03:58,603
But it's not my Web site anymore.
It's not my anything anymore.

939
01:03:58,949 --> 01:04:00,211
Why'd you quit?

940
01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:04,981
It started out small
and then it got big.

941
01:04:05,188 --> 01:04:08,521
That's generally considered
a good thing in business.

942
01:04:08,725 --> 01:04:11,159
Yeah, well, everything got big.

943
01:04:11,361 --> 01:04:14,888
Egos, lives, desires.

944
01:04:16,032 --> 01:04:18,557
I didn't like the big me.

945
01:04:18,902 --> 01:04:20,597
I wasn't very happy.

946
01:04:21,838 --> 01:04:24,568
You want to know
the most amazing part of it all?

947
01:04:24,774 --> 01:04:26,071
What?

948
01:04:26,276 --> 01:04:30,542
I got out before it got really big.

949
01:04:30,747 --> 01:04:32,112
Can you imagine that?

950
01:04:32,315 --> 01:04:36,217
No, I can't imagine you with millions
and millions of dollars.

951
01:04:39,089 --> 01:04:40,681
Did you change the beans?

952
01:04:42,225 --> 01:04:44,159
It's hazelnut. You don't like it?

953
01:04:45,195 --> 01:04:48,926
Honestly? Tastes like camel piss.
Let's stick to the classics.

954
01:04:49,699 --> 01:04:52,827
Excuse me, privacy. Heard of it?

955
01:04:53,970 --> 01:04:57,064
Very impressive set of pecs you got.
You work out, then?

956
01:04:57,741 --> 01:04:59,140
Me, haven't got time.

957
01:04:59,643 --> 01:05:02,339
Your pecs on the other hand, darling,
are edible.

958
01:05:03,246 --> 01:05:05,612
Now don't forget, dinner's at 8.

959
01:05:06,016 --> 01:05:09,952
It's dressy, because we're gonna
eat and we're going dancing.

960
01:05:10,153 --> 01:05:12,747
We'll see if "Last of the
Mohicans" here has rhythm.

961
01:05:14,891 --> 01:05:17,189
Doesn't he know how
to make his own coffee?

962
01:05:22,132 --> 01:05:23,861
-You ready to go?
-Yeah.

963
01:05:24,067 --> 01:05:27,093
Okay, good. Because I told
Chaz Cherry we'd be on time.

964
01:05:27,304 --> 01:05:30,364
We're calling everyone
by first and last names now?

965
01:05:30,573 --> 01:05:35,272
I don't want to see Chaz Cherry.
I want to get naked with Sara Deever.

966
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:38,413
You look beautiful.

967
01:05:40,317 --> 01:05:42,581
Thank you, Nelson Moss.

968
01:05:43,086 --> 01:05:46,146
Come on. You won't be bored,
I promise.

969
01:05:46,356 --> 01:05:48,324
Chaz Cherry is a great cook.

970
01:05:58,268 --> 01:06:00,395
-We're here.
-Oh, hallelujah!

971
01:06:00,603 --> 01:06:02,400
-And we're hungry.
-Too late.

972
01:06:02,605 --> 01:06:05,073
I sold your dinner to the homeless.

973
01:06:05,275 --> 01:06:09,371
Nelson, look at you. Didn't recognize
you with your clothes on.

974
01:06:09,913 --> 01:06:13,815
Nelson, you've met Chaz.
This is Cherry.

975
01:06:18,221 --> 01:06:19,984
Oh, watch the nails.

976
01:06:21,224 --> 01:06:22,623
Thanks very much.

977
01:06:25,128 --> 01:06:26,117
Wow.

978
01:06:28,365 --> 01:06:31,129
Very Pink Flamingos.

979
01:06:31,334 --> 01:06:36,033
Oh, my God! Sweetheart,
he says I look like Divine.

980
01:06:36,373 --> 01:06:38,136
Oh, that's awful.

981
01:06:38,341 --> 01:06:39,740
-You could lose a few pounds.
-Stop.

982
01:06:39,943 --> 01:06:40,967
-You stop.
-Bitch.

983
01:06:41,177 --> 01:06:44,476
Brandy this is Nelson.
Nelson, this is Brandy.

984
01:06:44,681 --> 01:06:46,842
-Hi.
-Oh, he is handsome.

985
01:06:47,050 --> 01:06:50,213
Put it back in your pants.
Grab a drink, Nelson.

986
01:06:51,421 --> 01:06:54,515
You all right? You seem
a little bit uncomfortable.

987
01:06:54,724 --> 01:06:56,521
Come here. Let me loosen you up.

988
01:06:56,726 --> 01:06:57,590
Just one top.

989
01:06:57,794 --> 01:07:00,388
-Is it the music, maybe?
-No, it's great.

990
01:07:00,597 --> 01:07:03,589
Because we got some
Michael Bolton if you prefer.

991
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:04,926
Alabama.

992
01:07:07,070 --> 01:07:08,628
Or is it the decor?

993
01:07:10,373 --> 01:07:11,431
No, it's....

994
01:07:15,111 --> 01:07:16,339
You're in dresses.

995
01:07:16,846 --> 01:07:19,679
This isn't a dress.
This is a sequined sensation.

996
01:07:19,883 --> 01:07:20,907
Cheers.

997
01:07:23,586 --> 01:07:24,848
That's not a dress.

998
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:26,522
God, let's eat. Come on.

999
01:07:28,191 --> 01:07:29,624
Starved.

1000
01:07:30,093 --> 01:07:31,526
I am hungry.

1001
01:07:31,728 --> 01:07:34,026
-There, you want those?
-Thanks very much.

1002
01:07:34,230 --> 01:07:37,563
God, they're absolutely beautiful.
Brandy, take care of them.

1003
01:07:38,334 --> 01:07:39,323
Very nice.

1004
01:07:39,536 --> 01:07:43,870
A little loving
From the oven

1005
01:07:44,074 --> 01:07:47,908
-Couscous for everyone.
-Wow, did you make that?

1006
01:07:48,111 --> 01:07:50,102
Excuse me, what did you just say?

1007
01:07:50,313 --> 01:07:52,873
Making, buying,
it's all a very thin line.

1008
01:07:53,083 --> 01:07:54,516
Oh, my God.

1009
01:07:54,851 --> 01:07:55,875
I don't believe it!

1010
01:07:56,086 --> 01:07:58,281
You know what's a thin line?
Your outfit.

1011
01:07:58,488 --> 01:08:03,255
It's a thin line between
late Cher and early Howard Keel.

1012
01:08:04,294 --> 01:08:06,455
Eat up. Where we're going,
you go before 10...

1013
01:08:06,663 --> 01:08:09,393
...you get a good place to dance
and boys get in free.

1014
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,998
Bring your dancing shoes?

1015
01:08:11,201 --> 01:08:13,897
Can you dance shirtless?
It happens there.

1016
01:08:14,104 --> 01:08:17,733
Are your nipples pierced?
You have a "Mom" tattoo on your ass?

1017
01:08:18,641 --> 01:08:22,133
You're not exactly a Muscle Mary,
but I think you'll cut it.

1018
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:26,273
You're smearing it.

1019
01:08:28,885 --> 01:08:31,979
I'll see what lover-boy's doing.
You can talk about me now.

1020
01:08:32,188 --> 01:08:33,177
We will.

1021
01:08:33,389 --> 01:08:34,686
A lot.

1022
01:08:42,132 --> 01:08:43,759
You want an Advil?

1023
01:08:44,167 --> 01:08:45,429
How'd you know?

1024
01:08:45,635 --> 01:08:47,364
The couscous.

1025
01:08:49,339 --> 01:08:51,330
-I'll be right back.
-Thanks.

1026
01:09:03,953 --> 01:09:06,615
Oh, God, I love this one.
It's brilliant.

1027
01:09:06,823 --> 01:09:08,654
I mean, the tartan's for shit.

1028
01:09:08,858 --> 01:09:10,485
What's wrong with the tartan?

1029
01:09:11,394 --> 01:09:12,691
It's a Scottish thing.

1030
01:09:12,896 --> 01:09:16,024
I mean, from concept to execution,
it's just sublime.

1031
01:09:19,702 --> 01:09:22,000
-There you go, sweetie.
-Thank you.

1032
01:09:23,673 --> 01:09:27,404
Your home base for everything.
From fast searches to shopping.

1033
01:09:27,610 --> 01:09:29,237
Get whatever you want--

1034
01:09:29,445 --> 01:09:30,537
Just an ad.

1035
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:34,381
Now, don't be modest.
I know you won a Gold Pencil for this.

1036
01:09:34,617 --> 01:09:36,084
How do you know that?

1037
01:09:36,352 --> 01:09:38,946
Well, I've got a day job
as well, you know.

1038
01:09:39,155 --> 01:09:40,486
What do you do?

1039
01:09:40,857 --> 01:09:43,621
I work in the dreaded world
of advertising.

1040
01:09:43,893 --> 01:09:45,383
Oh, really?

1041
01:09:45,595 --> 01:09:47,062
Oh, really.

1042
01:09:48,164 --> 01:09:49,153
What firm?

1043
01:09:50,633 --> 01:09:51,895
Baker Bohanon.

1044
01:09:53,069 --> 01:09:54,764
Oh, my God, you're Chaz Watley!

1045
01:09:54,971 --> 01:09:57,166
Oh, look. Baby's famous.

1046
01:09:57,373 --> 01:09:58,965
Don't even go there.

1047
01:10:00,243 --> 01:10:02,541
You've been that Chaz Watley...

1048
01:10:04,347 --> 01:10:05,974
...all this time?

1049
01:10:07,817 --> 01:10:09,910
Did you get the Dr. Diggity account?

1050
01:10:10,253 --> 01:10:14,053
Oh, my God. Nelson, just let it go.

1051
01:10:14,257 --> 01:10:16,987
Cherry doesn't care
about things like that.

1052
01:10:17,427 --> 01:10:18,792
Oh, really?

1053
01:10:18,995 --> 01:10:22,021
"Cherry doesn't care
about things like that"?

1054
01:10:23,166 --> 01:10:26,101
I bet Chaz cares
about things like that.

1055
01:10:26,769 --> 01:10:29,067
Or do you two not talk to each other?

1056
01:10:30,206 --> 01:10:32,800
I know Nelson cares
about things like that.

1057
01:10:33,843 --> 01:10:35,208
She should've told me.

1058
01:10:37,113 --> 01:10:38,205
This is--

1059
01:10:39,315 --> 01:10:42,716
This is awkward. If I'd known
who you were, I wouldn't have--

1060
01:10:43,386 --> 01:10:45,684
What? You would've worn a dress?

1061
01:10:45,888 --> 01:10:47,617
I don't think so.

1062
01:10:47,857 --> 01:10:50,155
You would've been
especially nice to me?

1063
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:53,796
-Yeah, something like that.
-Thanks very much.

1064
01:10:56,065 --> 01:10:57,930
He's not here right now.

1065
01:10:59,269 --> 01:11:01,703
I said, he's not here right now.

1066
01:11:02,138 --> 01:11:04,197
Why are you calling here?

1067
01:11:04,807 --> 01:11:08,766
How long have you been doing this?
How long have you been calling here?

1068
01:11:09,312 --> 01:11:10,404
I asked--

1069
01:11:10,613 --> 01:11:12,843
I can't-- I can't talk.

1070
01:11:14,050 --> 01:11:15,779
I can't talk right now.

1071
01:11:16,219 --> 01:11:18,813
I said, I can't talk to you right now.

1072
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:25,427
Is everything okay?

1073
01:11:29,265 --> 01:11:30,732
Ten guesses who that was.

1074
01:11:31,801 --> 01:11:32,790
Shit.

1075
01:11:35,305 --> 01:11:38,900
-So, how long has it been going on?
-It's not what you think.

1076
01:11:39,108 --> 01:11:41,303
You've talked to her behind my back?

1077
01:11:41,577 --> 01:11:44,171
Do you really want to talk
about this now?

1078
01:11:54,324 --> 01:11:57,225
No. I'm sorry.

1079
01:11:58,861 --> 01:12:02,763
Guys, I don't think I'm gonna go
dancing tonight. I feel so tired.

1080
01:12:02,965 --> 01:12:04,865
Come on, sweetheart.

1081
01:12:12,508 --> 01:12:14,169
What was that all about?

1082
01:12:16,679 --> 01:12:18,874
She gets migraines.

1083
01:12:19,082 --> 01:12:20,208
You know...

1084
01:12:20,850 --> 01:12:21,942
...terrible headaches.

1085
01:12:22,285 --> 01:12:24,549
No, the phone call.

1086
01:12:24,754 --> 01:12:26,187
Who was that?

1087
01:12:26,456 --> 01:12:27,980
Her sister.

1088
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:34,953
It's a long story,
and I am not going to tell it.

1089
01:12:57,186 --> 01:13:01,316
Hey. I'm sorry about
what happened down there.

1090
01:13:01,524 --> 01:13:04,891
That's okay, gives me a boost
to know that you're not perfect.

1091
01:13:06,028 --> 01:13:07,154
Feeling better?

1092
01:13:07,363 --> 01:13:08,762
Yeah, I'm fine.

1093
01:13:09,031 --> 01:13:11,522
Chaz told me it was
your sister on the phone.

1094
01:13:13,236 --> 01:13:15,170
Why does it upset you so much?

1095
01:13:20,143 --> 01:13:23,510
Remember talking about getting naked?

1096
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:27,145
"Naked with Sara Deever."
I think it's a good time for that.

1097
01:13:27,350 --> 01:13:29,341
Don't dodge me, talk to me.

1098
01:13:29,552 --> 01:13:30,951
Come get naked with me.

1099
01:13:31,154 --> 01:13:32,678
What happened?

1100
01:13:35,224 --> 01:13:36,885
That's not fair.

1101
01:13:37,193 --> 01:13:39,821
You expect me to be so honest...

1102
01:13:40,029 --> 01:13:41,690
...so forthcoming.

1103
01:13:44,333 --> 01:13:45,425
I do.

1104
01:13:46,769 --> 01:13:49,135
Because it's your month, Nelson.

1105
01:13:49,338 --> 01:13:50,771
Not mine.

1106
01:13:52,442 --> 01:13:56,538
Come on, you don't want to hear
about stupid family stuff.

1107
01:13:58,114 --> 01:13:59,706
Don't be mad.

1108
01:14:00,249 --> 01:14:01,614
Please.

1109
01:14:02,819 --> 01:14:04,218
Please.

1110
01:14:25,441 --> 01:14:27,375
You're not feeling well, are you?

1111
01:14:33,683 --> 01:14:36,584
Maybe tomorrow we'll get naked.

1112
01:14:37,420 --> 01:14:38,944
And tonight...

1113
01:14:39,989 --> 01:14:41,820
...we'll wear PJs.

1114
01:14:51,234 --> 01:14:54,465
Every woman I know
spends $200 on a haircut.

1115
01:14:54,971 --> 01:14:57,439
You use a vacuum cleaner.

1116
01:14:58,074 --> 01:15:00,440
Quit trying to change the subject.

1117
01:15:02,712 --> 01:15:06,341
You made a commitment, Nelson.
Our time isn't over.

1118
01:15:06,549 --> 01:15:07,948
It's one meeting.

1119
01:15:09,852 --> 01:15:14,653
Why is going to some powwow with this
slicko guy, Vince, such a big deal?

1120
01:15:14,857 --> 01:15:18,554
Because it's probably the chance
of a lifetime, that's why.

1121
01:15:19,061 --> 01:15:22,895
If it's a whole lifetime, why not
just postpone it for one more week?

1122
01:15:23,099 --> 01:15:25,795
Sara, when Edgar Price
says he'll meet you...

1123
01:15:26,002 --> 01:15:28,300
...you don't say:
"Wait, how about next month?"

1124
01:15:28,504 --> 01:15:30,495
You say, "Thank you, I'll be there."

1125
01:15:31,073 --> 01:15:32,768
He's one of the greats.

1126
01:15:32,975 --> 01:15:34,408
Where's my phone?

1127
01:15:35,545 --> 01:15:37,035
I hate it.

1128
01:15:38,881 --> 01:15:40,405
Nelson!

1129
01:15:42,852 --> 01:15:44,444
Nelson!

1130
01:15:46,589 --> 01:15:47,647
Damn it.

1131
01:15:47,857 --> 01:15:50,724
We can take anything
and just sell it, make it work.

1132
01:15:50,993 --> 01:15:54,929
Exactly. I mean, we've done
very well with Telecomputer.

1133
01:15:55,131 --> 01:15:57,099
Actually, I'm sure you're aware of--

1134
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:58,324
No, I wasn't.

1135
01:15:58,534 --> 01:16:01,264
We just won the Ad Age award
for that spot.

1136
01:16:01,470 --> 01:16:04,132
I think that was last year's spot.

1137
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:07,173
So we have a symbiosis,
the two of us, as a team--

1138
01:16:07,376 --> 01:16:10,777
We know a lot of guys who do this
for the awards, Mr. Price.

1139
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:14,438
-Not to say we don't get the awards--
-But still...

1140
01:16:15,084 --> 01:16:17,018
...we're not about the acclaim.

1141
01:16:17,219 --> 01:16:19,653
Handholding, dinners...

1142
01:16:19,855 --> 01:16:23,018
-...sending prostitutes to the client.
-Prostitutes?

1143
01:16:23,225 --> 01:16:26,217
-Who sends prostitutes?
-Who doesn't?

1144
01:16:27,163 --> 01:16:28,630
We're about the work.

1145
01:16:29,265 --> 01:16:32,029
If the work is great,
it speaks for itself.

1146
01:16:33,269 --> 01:16:35,066
That's all I need to know.

1147
01:16:36,238 --> 01:16:38,468
But are you married, any kids?

1148
01:16:38,674 --> 01:16:42,075
No, we've avoided the family thing
for quite some time.

1149
01:16:42,278 --> 01:16:44,269
-Most of our lives.
-Good.

1150
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:48,211
Because if you're worried about
quality of life or paternity leave...

1151
01:16:48,417 --> 01:16:50,351
...or any of that other
New Age crap...

1152
01:16:50,553 --> 01:16:53,215
...as much as I like you,
we can stop right here.

1153
01:16:53,422 --> 01:16:55,947
I want to be your
full-time commitment.

1154
01:16:56,726 --> 01:16:57,920
I can do that.

1155
01:16:58,561 --> 01:17:01,428
-We still had two weeks to go.
-What's two weeks?

1156
01:17:01,631 --> 01:17:03,895
You're kicking him out anyway.
Good shot.

1157
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:05,124
Thanks.

1158
01:17:06,435 --> 01:17:09,302
You know what?
I should've locked him in there.

1159
01:17:10,039 --> 01:17:12,269
I should've tied him to the bed.

1160
01:17:12,475 --> 01:17:14,170
What, do you mean you didn't?

1161
01:17:15,111 --> 01:17:16,806
It wouldn't have stopped him.

1162
01:17:17,013 --> 01:17:19,948
You can't force people to do
what they don't want to.

1163
01:17:20,149 --> 01:17:23,414
That's the whole point
of this thing, isn't it?

1164
01:17:23,619 --> 01:17:26,349
Besides, I know guys like Nelson.

1165
01:17:27,657 --> 01:17:30,854
You may have bitten off more
than you can chew this time.

1166
01:17:33,663 --> 01:17:35,460
That's what I like about him.

1167
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:39,998
It's also what scares
the hell out of me.

1168
01:17:40,403 --> 01:17:44,897
Just so you know, we've got a couple
of great clients in our hip pockets.

1169
01:17:45,107 --> 01:17:49,043
Plus, some leads on some new accounts.
So we come to you fully loaded.

1170
01:17:49,245 --> 01:17:51,440
You're not selling me a car, Holland.

1171
01:17:51,647 --> 01:17:55,981
Frankly, I'm not impressed with you.
But your reputation precedes you.

1172
01:17:56,185 --> 01:17:59,882
And if I have to take him
to get you, I will.

1173
01:18:00,089 --> 01:18:02,421
So here's my offer.

1174
01:18:02,625 --> 01:18:05,185
It's good as long
as we're at this table.

1175
01:18:05,728 --> 01:18:06,717
Oh, my--!

1176
01:18:06,929 --> 01:18:10,023
I'm so sorry! Excuse me.

1177
01:18:10,433 --> 01:18:11,991
-That's okay.
-Stop it.

1178
01:18:15,371 --> 01:18:16,895
You know, sweetie...

1179
01:18:17,306 --> 01:18:20,673
...we are what we do in this world,
and you're a waitress.

1180
01:18:20,876 --> 01:18:23,936
All that requires is that
you bring food and drink...

1181
01:18:24,146 --> 01:18:27,206
...to and from the table
without making a mess.

1182
01:18:27,416 --> 01:18:28,747
That's it.

1183
01:18:29,085 --> 01:18:32,919
So when you screw up something
as incredibly simple as that...

1184
01:18:33,856 --> 01:18:36,950
...it doesn't say a whole
hell of a lot about you, does it?

1185
01:18:37,159 --> 01:18:38,683
I'm-- I'm sorry.

1186
01:18:41,063 --> 01:18:44,032
If you gave a penny for her thoughts,
you'd get change.

1187
01:18:44,233 --> 01:18:45,996
They ought to fire her.

1188
01:18:46,202 --> 01:18:50,662
I always say a bad hire
strengthens the competition's hand.

1189
01:18:50,873 --> 01:18:53,865
A good general feeds off his enemy.

1190
01:18:54,310 --> 01:18:57,643
Actually, Sun Tzu said that last line.

1191
01:18:57,847 --> 01:18:58,905
In The Art of War.

1192
01:18:59,782 --> 01:19:01,477
You're right, Nelson.

1193
01:19:01,884 --> 01:19:03,010
You're very smart.

1194
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:18,926
Take a look, buddy.

1195
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:29,569
Not interested.

1196
01:19:31,947 --> 01:19:33,778
You don't like my offer?

1197
01:19:35,484 --> 01:19:37,748
It's not the offer I don't like.

1198
01:19:39,722 --> 01:19:40,950
It's you.

1199
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:46,928
Nelson, wait-- Nelson!

1200
01:19:47,129 --> 01:19:50,565
-You know what? This isn't--
-I hope you can afford this.

1201
01:19:53,469 --> 01:19:54,936
Shit.

1202
01:19:55,805 --> 01:19:57,773
Oh, Jesus Christ....

1203
01:19:59,108 --> 01:20:01,975
What's wrong with you?
You just shit in God's face.

1204
01:20:02,178 --> 01:20:04,942
If he's your god, you're in trouble.
He's not for me.

1205
01:20:05,147 --> 01:20:06,808
He's not for you? He is you.

1206
01:20:07,016 --> 01:20:10,417
-You're cloned from the same DNA.
-I'm not. If I am, shoot me.

1207
01:20:10,619 --> 01:20:12,678
Where's the gun? It's my career too!

1208
01:20:12,888 --> 01:20:15,914
You just blew it in there.
What is going on, man?

1209
01:20:16,659 --> 01:20:18,786
I know what it is. It's the girl.

1210
01:20:18,994 --> 01:20:21,224
The new mystery woman.
What's her name?

1211
01:20:21,831 --> 01:20:23,992
Don't ignore me. What's her name?

1212
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:26,464
-Sara.
-Don't you see what's happening?

1213
01:20:26,669 --> 01:20:28,728
She has got your balls in a jar.

1214
01:20:28,938 --> 01:20:30,872
I'm your friend. I wouldn't lie.

1215
01:20:31,073 --> 01:20:34,008
-You blew it in there.
-I'm sorry I cost you your job--

1216
01:20:34,210 --> 01:20:37,202
I don't need your pity, Nelson.
You blew it!

1217
01:20:37,413 --> 01:20:39,381
You're a loser, Nelson.

1218
01:20:39,682 --> 01:20:41,013
Loser!

1219
01:20:41,851 --> 01:20:44,251
Fine. I don't need you, Nelson.

1220
01:20:54,463 --> 01:20:58,524
Have you ever heard
of Phalaenopsis sanderiana?

1221
01:20:59,168 --> 01:21:00,658
It reminded me of you.

1222
01:21:02,872 --> 01:21:06,239
-You got the job, didn't you?
-Best offer anyone ever made me.

1223
01:21:07,810 --> 01:21:09,437
So when do you start?

1224
01:21:10,145 --> 01:21:12,579
We had a little problem
agreeing on that.

1225
01:21:12,781 --> 01:21:14,305
He suggested immediately.

1226
01:21:15,584 --> 01:21:16,642
I suggested...

1227
01:21:20,589 --> 01:21:21,681
...never.

1228
01:21:24,393 --> 01:21:26,258
-Never?
-Never.

1229
01:22:02,631 --> 01:22:05,327
-Come on, let's keep Ernie.
-Nope.

1230
01:22:05,968 --> 01:22:07,868
I found a home. He's gotta go.

1231
01:22:08,404 --> 01:22:10,634
But you love this little monster.

1232
01:22:10,839 --> 01:22:13,171
Soon I'll love another little monster.

1233
01:22:13,375 --> 01:22:15,002
Cold, heartless woman.

1234
01:22:19,515 --> 01:22:24,111
What about vegan turkey stuffed
with tofu and cranberries?

1235
01:22:24,787 --> 01:22:26,152
Ordering sounds better.

1236
01:22:28,490 --> 01:22:30,958
We're not ordering
Thanksgiving dinner.

1237
01:22:31,393 --> 01:22:34,055
It's the one time in life
it's good to be "trad."

1238
01:22:34,830 --> 01:22:38,425
In that case,
are you inviting your family?

1239
01:22:41,837 --> 01:22:42,861
No.

1240
01:22:44,139 --> 01:22:47,836
Holiday fights are a little
too traditional for my taste.

1241
01:22:48,043 --> 01:22:49,510
What do you fight about?

1242
01:22:51,113 --> 01:22:52,512
Everything.

1243
01:22:53,482 --> 01:22:56,849
Religion, money, sex.

1244
01:22:57,686 --> 01:23:02,180
Sara's decisions.
Sara's unconventional ways.

1245
01:23:03,692 --> 01:23:05,887
Sara's lifestyle.

1246
01:23:09,598 --> 01:23:13,034
-They think I'm a freak.
-You are a freak.

1247
01:23:15,104 --> 01:23:17,334
Anyway, boring subject.

1248
01:23:18,273 --> 01:23:20,036
I'm sure they miss you.

1249
01:23:21,744 --> 01:23:23,109
I know they do.

1250
01:23:23,512 --> 01:23:26,345
You know, there's a
good tradition called "making up."

1251
01:23:26,882 --> 01:23:27,974
You could try it.

1252
01:23:32,154 --> 01:23:33,348
Yeah.

1253
01:23:36,759 --> 01:23:38,784
Someday I'll have to do that.

1254
01:23:53,208 --> 01:23:54,573
Mind walking him down?

1255
01:23:54,777 --> 01:23:55,971
Sure.

1256
01:23:56,211 --> 01:23:57,473
Thanks.

1257
01:23:58,914 --> 01:24:00,381
Come on, boy.

1258
01:24:01,717 --> 01:24:03,582
Say goodbye to Sara.

1259
01:24:05,387 --> 01:24:06,547
Bye.

1260
01:24:20,636 --> 01:24:23,571
Hey, come on, puppy.

1261
01:24:27,543 --> 01:24:29,807
-Thanks.
-Yeah. Sure.

1262
01:24:30,212 --> 01:24:31,474
See you, Ernie.

1263
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:46,186
Hey.

1264
01:24:48,797 --> 01:24:50,731
Why can't she keep one
for a change?

1265
01:24:51,366 --> 01:24:53,391
I guess she helps more this way.

1266
01:24:53,802 --> 01:24:55,326
I've been thinking.

1267
01:24:55,537 --> 01:24:56,526
Oh, yeah?

1268
01:24:56,738 --> 01:24:58,933
If you want to adopt me, you can.

1269
01:25:00,476 --> 01:25:05,573
I mean, Father Sunday is on Monday.
It would be good timing.

1270
01:25:09,118 --> 01:25:11,143
I don't quite know what to say.

1271
01:25:14,623 --> 01:25:16,022
I'll tell you what...

1272
01:25:16,625 --> 01:25:18,616
...l can't adopt you...

1273
01:25:19,027 --> 01:25:21,325
...but I'll come with you
to Father Sunday.

1274
01:25:21,530 --> 01:25:23,191
-Promise?
-Promise.

1275
01:25:23,565 --> 01:25:25,692
Wait till my mom hears!

1276
01:26:24,226 --> 01:26:25,625
Sara!

1277
01:26:37,339 --> 01:26:39,364
I have an announcement to make.

1278
01:26:42,311 --> 01:26:43,608
What's wrong?

1279
01:26:44,112 --> 01:26:46,376
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

1280
01:26:49,017 --> 01:26:50,644
What do you keep in there?

1281
01:26:52,154 --> 01:26:56,056
-Nothing.
-"Nothing" doesn't require a lock.

1282
01:26:56,325 --> 01:26:57,417
What's wrong?

1283
01:26:57,626 --> 01:26:58,820
So...

1284
01:27:00,929 --> 01:27:04,023
-...what's the big announcement?
-Don't do the dodge.

1285
01:27:06,969 --> 01:27:08,561
Am I okay?

1286
01:27:10,138 --> 01:27:11,901
No, I'm not okay.

1287
01:27:13,375 --> 01:27:14,967
I miss Ernie.

1288
01:27:15,777 --> 01:27:17,677
And I've got a migraine.

1289
01:27:20,048 --> 01:27:21,242
So...

1290
01:27:22,150 --> 01:27:23,879
...what's your big announcement?

1291
01:27:24,519 --> 01:27:25,918
Marry me.

1292
01:27:28,090 --> 01:27:29,318
What?

1293
01:27:29,524 --> 01:27:31,287
Will you marry me?

1294
01:27:33,328 --> 01:27:35,421
Sara, I stood on the street...

1295
01:27:36,565 --> 01:27:38,430
...and I realized...

1296
01:27:39,868 --> 01:27:41,233
...this is it.

1297
01:27:41,937 --> 01:27:43,734
Life will never be better...

1298
01:27:44,306 --> 01:27:46,240
...or sweeter than this.

1299
01:27:46,842 --> 01:27:48,241
I'm happy.

1300
01:27:49,244 --> 01:27:50,677
I'm in love.

1301
01:27:52,147 --> 01:27:53,478
Marry me.

1302
01:27:56,652 --> 01:27:58,745
That's incredibly sweet.

1303
01:28:01,523 --> 01:28:04,856
-But you don't understand.
-Yes, I do. It all makes sense.

1304
01:28:06,194 --> 01:28:07,752
I want you.

1305
01:28:08,030 --> 01:28:09,861
I want this life.

1306
01:28:20,242 --> 01:28:21,641
Marry me.

1307
01:28:27,015 --> 01:28:28,676
Marry me, Sara.

1308
01:28:34,189 --> 01:28:36,657
-I can't.
-Why not?

1309
01:28:38,460 --> 01:28:40,018
Because of me.

1310
01:28:40,362 --> 01:28:41,351
What about you?

1311
01:28:41,563 --> 01:28:43,827
For God's sake, Sara.
Please, just--

1312
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:45,465
Just tell me what's wrong.

1313
01:28:45,867 --> 01:28:47,562
Tell me the truth.

1314
01:28:49,338 --> 01:28:50,600
I can't.

1315
01:28:53,442 --> 01:28:54,841
Sara?

1316
01:29:04,152 --> 01:29:05,141
Jesus.

1317
01:29:06,455 --> 01:29:07,444
I'm fine.

1318
01:29:08,457 --> 01:29:10,823
No, I'm fine.

1319
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:13,721
-I'm fine.
-What the hell is going on?

1320
01:29:14,096 --> 01:29:15,723
No, Nelson.

1321
01:29:17,165 --> 01:29:19,861
No, Nelson, no!

1322
01:29:22,804 --> 01:29:23,896
No.

1323
01:29:28,410 --> 01:29:30,469
Is this what you wanted to see?

1324
01:29:31,146 --> 01:29:32,511
This is it!

1325
01:29:33,949 --> 01:29:36,315
Is this enough truth for you?

1326
01:29:36,518 --> 01:29:37,849
Does this make you happy?

1327
01:29:38,053 --> 01:29:42,012
Goddamn you!
You just couldn't leave it alone!

1328
01:29:42,657 --> 01:29:43,851
Sara, stop.

1329
01:29:44,059 --> 01:29:48,052
You just couldn't leave it--
God, just leave it alone.

1330
01:30:06,581 --> 01:30:09,049
It's non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

1331
01:30:11,987 --> 01:30:13,318
It's a type of cancer.

1332
01:30:15,323 --> 01:30:18,349
You shouldn't have to find out
like this. I'm sorry.

1333
01:30:20,896 --> 01:30:22,955
She's gonna be asleep for hours.

1334
01:30:23,165 --> 01:30:26,157
You want to go for a walk,
have a chat or something?

1335
01:30:28,370 --> 01:30:30,634
-Yeah.
-Yeah, okay.

1336
01:30:38,713 --> 01:30:41,341
You said she stopped
her treatments a year ago?

1337
01:30:43,251 --> 01:30:45,082
What about the pills?

1338
01:30:45,387 --> 01:30:48,879
It just gets her through the day.
She stopped trying to beat it.

1339
01:30:49,090 --> 01:30:52,253
She did it all for a year.
Nothing worked.

1340
01:30:52,594 --> 01:30:56,758
Look, I'm no doctor, but when
you're unchecked, wouldn't that--?

1341
01:30:56,965 --> 01:30:57,954
Yeah.

1342
01:30:59,568 --> 01:31:01,126
It's spread everywhere.

1343
01:31:08,376 --> 01:31:11,868
How could she get involved with me
and not tell me she was sick?

1344
01:31:14,616 --> 01:31:16,413
I mean, what was she thinking?

1345
01:31:16,885 --> 01:31:20,821
She was thinking you'd
be the same as all the others.

1346
01:31:21,122 --> 01:31:23,113
She'd dump you after a month.

1347
01:31:24,793 --> 01:31:27,227
You've got to understand something.

1348
01:31:27,796 --> 01:31:29,696
She's completely powerless.

1349
01:31:29,898 --> 01:31:32,458
With these rules, you know...

1350
01:31:32,667 --> 01:31:36,899
...they give her the illusion
and dignity of control.

1351
01:31:37,639 --> 01:31:39,334
It's kept her alive.

1352
01:31:41,877 --> 01:31:44,641
The rift with her family,
that's what it's about?

1353
01:31:44,846 --> 01:31:46,040
These rules.

1354
01:31:47,782 --> 01:31:48,806
Yeah.

1355
01:31:49,985 --> 01:31:52,977
Her family couldn't handle it.
They wouldn't let go.

1356
01:31:53,188 --> 01:31:55,486
They kept trying to run her disease.

1357
01:31:55,690 --> 01:31:57,123
So she took off.

1358
01:31:57,325 --> 01:31:58,883
And came here?

1359
01:32:01,897 --> 01:32:04,661
She told me if she couldn't
live a normal life...

1360
01:32:04,866 --> 01:32:08,962
...she was determined to live an
abnormal one the best way she could.

1361
01:32:11,273 --> 01:32:12,706
I don't get it.

1362
01:32:16,278 --> 01:32:19,805
She loves life more
than anyone I've ever met.

1363
01:32:20,382 --> 01:32:22,179
How can she just give up?

1364
01:32:22,384 --> 01:32:24,818
You listening to anything
I'm telling you?

1365
01:32:25,020 --> 01:32:26,385
She's not giving up.

1366
01:32:26,588 --> 01:32:29,989
She's making the most
of the time she's got left.

1367
01:32:31,159 --> 01:32:32,649
Don't mess with that.

1368
01:32:38,733 --> 01:32:40,257
I'm sorry.

1369
01:32:43,505 --> 01:32:45,973
I didn't want you to see any of this.

1370
01:32:48,710 --> 01:32:50,405
I wanted you...

1371
01:32:50,745 --> 01:32:54,237
...to know me loving life, you know?

1372
01:32:55,650 --> 01:32:56,947
Come here.

1373
01:33:14,369 --> 01:33:16,462
Will you do something for me?

1374
01:33:18,039 --> 01:33:19,131
Anything.

1375
01:33:20,175 --> 01:33:21,972
Will you get me out of here?

1376
01:33:23,211 --> 01:33:24,337
Take me home.

1377
01:33:41,696 --> 01:33:42,924
Okay.

1378
01:34:04,586 --> 01:34:05,848
Jesus.

1379
01:34:13,528 --> 01:34:14,688
They're here.

1380
01:34:15,830 --> 01:34:17,161
Hey, darling.

1381
01:34:17,399 --> 01:34:18,388
Hey, sweetie.

1382
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:20,397
You're sick? You look fabulous.

1383
01:34:20,602 --> 01:34:22,433
Oh, this is just a lie.

1384
01:34:22,637 --> 01:34:24,002
You look great.

1385
01:34:24,205 --> 01:34:27,436
-Want a nice, warm bath?
-Come on, sweetie.

1386
01:34:27,642 --> 01:34:30,042
-We'll run you a bath.
-What's on the menu tonight?

1387
01:34:30,245 --> 01:34:33,772
-We have lovely appetizers.
-Nice codeine.

1388
01:34:33,982 --> 01:34:38,009
Codeine? What else?
Donnatal, that's your favorite.

1389
01:34:38,219 --> 01:34:40,915
Come on, girl. Let's get you in here.

1390
01:34:41,122 --> 01:34:42,282
Okay.

1391
01:34:44,225 --> 01:34:45,214
Nice and easy.

1392
01:34:45,694 --> 01:34:49,221
Sara, I know doctors I could call.

1393
01:34:50,198 --> 01:34:51,460
No doctors.

1394
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:57,062
I'm gonna be fine, Nelson.
But you can't be here.

1395
01:34:58,339 --> 01:35:01,035
I don't want you here.
You can't see this.

1396
01:35:01,342 --> 01:35:03,606
Please, go.

1397
01:35:03,812 --> 01:35:05,336
Okay, okay, he's going.

1398
01:35:06,848 --> 01:35:09,510
I can't stand by and do nothing,
just watch her....

1399
01:35:09,951 --> 01:35:10,940
Die?

1400
01:35:12,220 --> 01:35:14,154
That's why she wants you to go.

1401
01:35:14,656 --> 01:35:15,645
Go on.

1402
01:35:29,104 --> 01:35:30,401
Hey, Abner.

1403
01:35:32,507 --> 01:35:34,475
Today's not gonna be a great play day.

1404
01:35:35,110 --> 01:35:37,874
I know.
It's gonna be Father Sunday.

1405
01:35:38,079 --> 01:35:39,410
Did you forget?

1406
01:35:41,950 --> 01:35:43,850
Oh, God, I'm sorry, Ab. I can't.

1407
01:35:46,654 --> 01:35:48,451
But you promised.

1408
01:35:49,791 --> 01:35:51,349
I guess I don't have a dad.

1409
01:35:51,559 --> 01:35:54,790
I mean, I do,
but I don't know who he is.

1410
01:35:55,597 --> 01:35:56,996
So I brought Nelson.

1411
01:35:58,133 --> 01:36:01,398
We do stuff, and it's fun,
because he makes me feel smart.

1412
01:36:02,971 --> 01:36:04,905
I guess I feel like...

1413
01:36:05,340 --> 01:36:08,503
...if I got into trouble,
he'd take care of me.

1414
01:36:09,077 --> 01:36:12,444
Kind of like a best friend,
just bigger.

1415
01:36:14,315 --> 01:36:15,873
Thank you, Abner.

1416
01:36:19,587 --> 01:36:21,646
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.

1417
01:36:22,557 --> 01:36:25,390
I don't know.
I probably won't be here tomorrow.

1418
01:36:25,593 --> 01:36:26,787
How come?

1419
01:36:27,128 --> 01:36:29,824
I gotta do some thinking,
make a tough decision.

1420
01:36:33,134 --> 01:36:37,070
Sara thinks you don't respect her
choices? Something like that?

1421
01:36:38,039 --> 01:36:40,371
I don't know.
You always see that stuff on TV.

1422
01:36:41,476 --> 01:36:43,967
I think you're the coolest kid
I've ever met.

1423
01:36:44,179 --> 01:36:46,477
-I'll see you.
-See you.

1424
01:36:47,148 --> 01:36:48,615
Take care.

1425
01:38:25,546 --> 01:38:26,808
Shit.

1426
01:38:27,015 --> 01:38:28,175
You all right?

1427
01:38:29,217 --> 01:38:31,708
-Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
-Good.

1428
01:38:34,756 --> 01:38:39,125
I was planning on serving the pumpkin
on the floor, so this is....

1429
01:38:39,327 --> 01:38:40,521
This is really good.

1430
01:38:41,896 --> 01:38:43,761
Oh, God, Chaz.

1431
01:38:44,165 --> 01:38:46,292
Please tell me we're gonna have fun.

1432
01:38:48,136 --> 01:38:50,627
Thanksgiving's fun, right?
It's fun.

1433
01:38:51,072 --> 01:38:52,699
It'll be a riot.

1434
01:38:54,242 --> 01:38:55,641
Come here.

1435
01:38:56,077 --> 01:38:57,442
Give us a cuddle.

1436
01:39:01,416 --> 01:39:02,974
I need some fun.

1437
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:08,081
You know, he asked me to marry him.

1438
01:39:08,957 --> 01:39:10,618
He's not the first.

1439
01:39:14,862 --> 01:39:18,127
No, but it was the first time
I wanted to say yes.

1440
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:20,333
So why didn't you?

1441
01:39:23,104 --> 01:39:26,505
Because, Chaz, I let the whole thing
go too far.

1442
01:39:26,708 --> 01:39:29,142
Oh, yeah? Too far for who?

1443
01:39:30,078 --> 01:39:31,602
Both of us.

1444
01:39:32,847 --> 01:39:33,836
Anyway....

1445
01:39:34,916 --> 01:39:37,441
No need to talk about it.
He's gone.

1446
01:39:37,919 --> 01:39:41,855
Well, you did kick him out.
He'll be back if you let him.

1447
01:39:45,493 --> 01:39:47,484
I don't want him to come back.

1448
01:39:48,262 --> 01:39:49,251
Right.

1449
01:39:51,232 --> 01:39:53,962
You know, it's okay to break
your own rules, Sara.

1450
01:39:54,802 --> 01:39:56,793
You fell in love.

1451
01:39:57,238 --> 01:39:58,637
That's great.

1452
01:39:58,906 --> 01:40:02,307
It may not follow your master plan,
but you can't control everything.

1453
01:40:02,510 --> 01:40:03,738
Okay, just stop it.

1454
01:40:04,112 --> 01:40:06,512
I really don't need this
right now, Chaz.

1455
01:40:07,782 --> 01:40:08,976
Jesus!

1456
01:40:10,118 --> 01:40:14,851
There's no rule that gives me the
right to put him through all of this.

1457
01:40:15,056 --> 01:40:16,318
This hell.

1458
01:40:16,557 --> 01:40:18,047
I don't....

1459
01:40:21,562 --> 01:40:25,157
-It'll just hurt him in the end.
-It'll hurt, whatever you do.

1460
01:40:25,833 --> 01:40:26,925
We all will.

1461
01:40:27,635 --> 01:40:28,624
But...

1462
01:40:30,004 --> 01:40:32,234
...if I've learned anything...

1463
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:35,170
...it's that you should have
those who love you near...

1464
01:40:35,376 --> 01:40:37,742
...as long as you possibly can.

1465
01:40:44,052 --> 01:40:45,041
Yeah.

1466
01:40:46,354 --> 01:40:48,447
Toast! Toast.

1467
01:40:50,358 --> 01:40:52,622
Happy we-stole-your-land-
and-killed-your-people day.

1468
01:40:52,827 --> 01:40:55,125
-Oh, Al.
-That's a good one, Al.

1469
01:40:58,332 --> 01:40:59,799
Here's to you.

1470
01:41:00,001 --> 01:41:02,299
-Here you go, babe.
-Here's to you.

1471
01:41:05,673 --> 01:41:06,662
Merry Christmas!

1472
01:41:12,647 --> 01:41:14,774
Merry Christmas!

1473
01:41:19,287 --> 01:41:20,652
Merry Christmas, Sara.

1474
01:41:31,232 --> 01:41:33,291
I think it's Thanksgiving, isn't it?

1475
01:41:33,534 --> 01:41:34,831
Not for you.

1476
01:41:35,069 --> 01:41:36,730
You shouldn't have to wait.

1477
01:41:39,941 --> 01:41:43,775
Does anyone else have
a sudden desire for Chinese food?

1478
01:41:43,978 --> 01:41:45,946
-Right on!
-Yeah.

1479
01:41:46,414 --> 01:41:47,972
It's good to see you, Nelson.

1480
01:41:49,550 --> 01:41:54,544
Do you know how the Chinese
celebrate Christmas and Thanksgiving?

1481
01:41:55,623 --> 01:41:56,715
Ciao, Santa.

1482
01:41:56,924 --> 01:41:58,391
I thought you'd never get here.

1483
01:41:58,593 --> 01:42:00,652
Come on, let's go.

1484
01:42:05,333 --> 01:42:08,700
For you, my sweet Sara...

1485
01:42:10,004 --> 01:42:14,100
...l bring you 1 2 gifts of Christmas.

1486
01:42:18,513 --> 01:42:19,537
One:

1487
01:42:23,284 --> 01:42:27,311
The famous Colombo log.
The salami that started it all.

1488
01:42:30,558 --> 01:42:31,547
Two:

1489
01:42:33,427 --> 01:42:38,387
A kaleidoscope of a coiffeur,
for the barking-mad pet crusader.

1490
01:42:40,935 --> 01:42:42,334
Number three:

1491
01:42:42,603 --> 01:42:45,436
A bullwhip for the dizzy dominatrix.

1492
01:42:45,640 --> 01:42:49,201
So you can rule your world in style
and whip me into shape.

1493
01:42:51,712 --> 01:42:52,701
Four:

1494
01:42:53,581 --> 01:42:54,673
I present...

1495
01:42:55,516 --> 01:42:58,314
...Sara, a custom-made fragrance
capturing...

1496
01:42:58,519 --> 01:43:00,919
...that special something...

1497
01:43:01,122 --> 01:43:03,920
...a woman leaves on a man.

1498
01:43:08,129 --> 01:43:10,927
-Nelson, this is....
-Only the beginning.

1499
01:43:11,232 --> 01:43:12,221
Five:

1500
01:43:14,735 --> 01:43:17,602
Why is Harriet so Hairy?

1501
01:43:17,805 --> 01:43:22,674
The definitive guide to understanding
our transvestite friends.

1502
01:43:24,879 --> 01:43:26,107
Six:

1503
01:43:26,314 --> 01:43:31,115
Tiny bubbles, for those leisurely
soaks we love so much.

1504
01:43:32,453 --> 01:43:33,442
Number seven:

1505
01:43:34,722 --> 01:43:37,247
A hundred muni train tokens...

1506
01:43:37,725 --> 01:43:39,693
...for the many, many...

1507
01:43:39,894 --> 01:43:42,124
...great rides of your life.

1508
01:43:44,732 --> 01:43:46,256
Number eight:

1509
01:43:47,635 --> 01:43:49,535
A collection of music to swoon by.

1510
01:43:49,937 --> 01:43:54,033
Which, by the way, happens to go
very nicely with gift number nine:

1511
01:43:55,209 --> 01:43:56,608
Dance classes.

1512
01:43:57,345 --> 01:44:01,475
Mildred's Academy of Dance,
guaranteed to get you off my toes...

1513
01:44:02,850 --> 01:44:04,112
...in a week.

1514
01:44:04,685 --> 01:44:07,313
-You sure?
-I'm positive.

1515
01:44:07,555 --> 01:44:09,113
Number 10:

1516
01:44:09,724 --> 01:44:13,421
For the gentle lady
who hates doing dishes.

1517
01:44:13,628 --> 01:44:14,822
A dishwasher!

1518
01:44:20,701 --> 01:44:22,464
Nelson, this is too much.

1519
01:44:23,137 --> 01:44:24,399
It's not enough.

1520
01:44:25,873 --> 01:44:26,897
Number 11 :

1521
01:44:27,341 --> 01:44:31,573
Live, and in your apartment,
back by popular demand...

1522
01:44:31,779 --> 01:44:33,303
...l give you...

1523
01:44:34,315 --> 01:44:35,805
...Ernie!

1524
01:44:39,153 --> 01:44:40,711
Hi, baby!

1525
01:44:43,157 --> 01:44:44,749
I missed you.

1526
01:44:46,327 --> 01:44:51,355
And if this last gift doesn't prove
how much I love you, nothing will.

1527
01:46:19,820 --> 01:46:23,347
Every month is November, Sara.

1528
01:46:25,092 --> 01:46:27,083
And I love you every day.

1529
01:46:29,797 --> 01:46:31,196
Nelson, there's--

1530
01:46:31,399 --> 01:46:35,096
This is our month,
and it never has to end.

1531
01:46:44,111 --> 01:46:48,172
I surrender all attempts
to control life...

1532
01:46:48,482 --> 01:46:49,949
...yours or mine.

1533
01:46:51,218 --> 01:46:52,913
I live for one thing:

1534
01:46:54,054 --> 01:46:55,351
To love you.

1535
01:46:56,290 --> 01:46:57,917
To make you happy.

1536
01:46:58,859 --> 01:47:02,955
To live firmly and joyously
in the moment.

1537
01:47:03,964 --> 01:47:05,955
November is all I know.

1538
01:47:07,101 --> 01:47:09,069
And all I ever want to know.

1539
01:48:35,489 --> 01:48:36,888
What are you doing?

1540
01:48:38,225 --> 01:48:39,317
Where are you going?

1541
01:48:41,428 --> 01:48:42,417
Out.

1542
01:48:45,833 --> 01:48:48,631
This will give you time
to get your stuff together.

1543
01:48:50,271 --> 01:48:51,260
So you can go.

1544
01:48:52,206 --> 01:48:54,606
Our month is over.

1545
01:48:54,808 --> 01:48:56,241
Sara, I'm not leaving.

1546
01:48:59,113 --> 01:49:00,045
Sara!

1547
01:49:30,277 --> 01:49:31,835
Sara, stop!

1548
01:49:42,923 --> 01:49:45,585
Sara, stop running.
Sara!

1549
01:49:46,427 --> 01:49:47,917
Sara, please.

1550
01:49:49,196 --> 01:49:50,663
I'm not leaving you.

1551
01:49:50,864 --> 01:49:53,833
-I know you love me.
-I do.

1552
01:49:54,034 --> 01:49:55,467
I've never felt this.

1553
01:49:55,669 --> 01:49:59,002
I never thought I'd have the chance,
and you gave that to me, Nelson.

1554
01:49:59,206 --> 01:50:02,767
-Then why are you doing this?
-Because it's starting to happen.

1555
01:50:02,977 --> 01:50:04,137
I don't care.

1556
01:50:04,345 --> 01:50:07,644
Nelson, if you leave now, everything
we had will be perfect forever.

1557
01:50:07,848 --> 01:50:10,373
Sara, life isn't perfect.

1558
01:50:12,920 --> 01:50:16,253
All we have is how you'll remember me.

1559
01:50:16,757 --> 01:50:20,249
And I need that memory
to be strong and beautiful.

1560
01:50:22,763 --> 01:50:24,128
Don't you see?

1561
01:50:25,399 --> 01:50:30,063
If I know that I'm remembered
that way, then I can face anything.

1562
01:50:30,270 --> 01:50:31,362
Anything.

1563
01:50:32,873 --> 01:50:36,604
Nelson, you're my immortality.

1564
01:50:36,810 --> 01:50:38,607
I want to take care of you.

1565
01:50:39,046 --> 01:50:41,276
I'm gonna be all right.

1566
01:50:41,915 --> 01:50:43,576
I'm going home.

1567
01:50:45,252 --> 01:50:46,947
They know I'm coming.

1568
01:50:47,388 --> 01:50:49,879
I need to do this.

1569
01:50:50,991 --> 01:50:52,117
It doesn't seem--

1570
01:50:52,326 --> 01:50:56,456
Just like I need to know that you'll
go on and have a beautiful life.

1571
01:50:56,664 --> 01:50:58,097
The one you deserve.

1572
01:50:59,266 --> 01:51:00,790
I only want you.

1573
01:51:02,803 --> 01:51:04,270
You have me...

1574
01:51:05,239 --> 01:51:06,433
...forever.

1575
01:51:08,876 --> 01:51:10,776
Now let me go.

1576
01:51:19,653 --> 01:51:20,984
All right, Sara.

1577
01:51:23,424 --> 01:51:24,413
All right.

1578
01:51:26,794 --> 01:51:28,386
Close your eyes.

1579
01:51:51,518 --> 01:51:53,952
I love you, Nelson Moss.

1580
01:51:58,826 --> 01:52:01,056
I love you, Sara Deever.

1581
01:52:17,377 --> 01:52:18,742
Remember me.

1582
