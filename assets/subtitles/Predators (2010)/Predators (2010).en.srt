Well, between that
and the sun,

00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,783
I'd say we have

00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,748
They're all

He doesn't belong.

185
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,334
Belong to what?

186
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,839
I'd say we were chosen.

How have you survived?

555
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:50,239
Salvaging what I can,
when I can,

556
00:56:50,324 --> 00:56:53,326
from whatever I can.

557
00:56:55,287 --> 00:56:56,412
Oh.

558
00:56:57,956 --> 00:57:00,416

559

561

all in, too?

562
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:09,634
Yeah.

563
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:11,886
Hmm. (CHUCKLING)

564
00:57:12,638 --> 00:57:14,388

Hey, Agent Orange,
you wanna put that down?

569
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:31,948
Certain people
around here

570
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:33,157
are particular
about other people

571
00:57:33,242 --> 00:57:34,367
messing with their shit.

572
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:37,453
Very important, though.

You motherfuckers.

575
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:47,380
So, you killed one?

576
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:49,215
Uh-uh.

577
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,384
I killed two.

578
00:57:52,761 --> 00:57:54,220
Maybe three.

579
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:57,557
I can't remember. Anyway,

580
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:02,186
there's two different types
of them out there.

581
00:58:02,271 --> 00:58:04,856
Hmm? Now they're similar,
but they're different.

582
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:07,775
It's kind of like
the difference between
dogs and wolves.

583
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:11,154
The ones that
are running things
up there,

584
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:13,990
the larger ones,
hunt the smaller ones.

585
00:58:14,074 --> 00:58:16,993
It's some kind of
blood feud, I guess.

586
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:19,453

for a long time.

(MUMBLING)

588
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:23,499
They do this
just for sport?

589
00:58:23,584 --> 00:58:27,587
Oh, yeah,
they bring in fresh meat
season after season.

590
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:30,173
I mean, shit you
wouldn't believe.

591
00:58:31,133 --> 00:58:32,842
Bring it in,

592
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:37,221
and hunt it
and kill it.
In that order.

593
00:58:39,308 --> 00:58:41,475
How long you
been here, man?

594
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:43,936
Uh. . .

595
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:48,107
Seven seasons, I think.

596
00:58:49,109 --> 00:58:51,194
What? Ten?

597
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:53,112
Damn.

598
00:58:53,197 --> 00:58:57,116
Anyway, every once
in a while, one of us
kills one of them.

599
00:58:58,035 --> 00:59:01,704
And, let me tell you,
that's when they get
real interested.

600
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:05,958
See, they learn quick.
They adapt.

601
00:59:07,461 --> 00:59:09,921
They develop
a whole new set
of skills.

602
00:59:10,005 --> 00:59:14,800
They come back
the next season in threes,
always in threes.

603
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:16,928
Their armor
might've changed,

604
00:59:17,012 --> 00:59:19,764
or their weapons
have changed,

605
00:59:19,848 --> 00:59:22,141
or their tactics
have changed.

606
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:25,144
It's amazing.

607
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:27,688
So, it's like evolution.

608
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:32,568
They're trying
to make themselves
into better killers.

609
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:34,320
Mmm-hmm.

610
00:59:35,322 --> 00:59:37,698
You said they come back.

611
00:59:39,868 --> 00:59:41,077
How?

612
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:43,162
They got a ship.

613
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:44,664
A ship?

614
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:45,748
Yeah.

615
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:48,125
It's 30 yards
from their camp.

617
00:59:50,921 --> 00:59:52,838

they wouldn't see it.

they wouldn't.

619

620
00:59:59,346 --> 01:00:01,347
You could've helped us.

621
01:00:04,685 --> 01:00:06,727
How do we kill them?

622
01:00:08,897 --> 01:00:10,856
However you can.

623
01:00:12,693 --> 01:00:14,026
They must have
a weakness.

624
01:00:16,238 --> 01:00:17,571
Not many.

You dig in deep.
You stay hid.

door number two.

there ain't no edge
of the preserve.

wanna tell me about that ship?

Brilliant.

I've been here,
it never occurred to me

640
01:01:11,752 --> 01:01:13,794
to commandeer
the alien spacecraft.

641
01:01:15,297 --> 01:01:18,090

how to fly it.

She's paralyzed.

922
01:31:09,131 --> 01:31:11,465
It gave her something.
I don't know what,

923
01:31:11,550 --> 01:31:13,801
but it paralyzed her.

924
01:31:17,681 --> 01:31:19,056
Come on.

925
01:31:37,534 --> 01:31:40,578
You're so busy
taking care of others,

926
01:31:40,662 --> 01:31:42,454
you forgot
to look out
for yourself.

927
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:45,916
We're getting
out of here.

928
01:31:46,001 --> 01:31:48,085
You just hang
tight, okay?

929
01:31:48,587 --> 01:31:50,379
I didn't think
you'd come back.

930
01:31:52,132 --> 01:31:54,008
But she,

931
01:31:54,092 --> 01:31:56,385
she never lost
faith in you.

932
01:31:57,304 --> 01:31:59,138
I guess I owe you
an apology.

934
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:03,767

after all.

935

No.

936
01:32:07,439 --> 01:32:08,647
I'm not.

Come here.

941
01:32:36,885 --> 01:32:40,179
Please don't kill me.
Please don't kill me.

942
01:32:40,722 --> 01:32:42,056
I won't.
