You see? You see?
You see? You see?

368
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:04,419
That's showing a little spunk.

369
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:06,338
After all, I'm not running a mortuary.

370
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:07,798
(GIGGLING) No.

Come here.

374
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,596
Did you have a date recently?

375
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:00,809
Yes.

376
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,564
With whom did you have a date?

377
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,401
- Peter.
- Peter?

378
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:10,944
Did you have sex?

379
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:12,029
(LAUGHS)

380
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:15,407
No?

381

I don't know.

382
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:24,875
Are you shy?

383
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:28,712
I'm shy.

384
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:31,548
You're not shy.

385
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:33,717
You're a lawyer.

386
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:38,096
I'm shy.

387
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:41,099
I overcome my shyness to...

388
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,104
In order to get things done.

389
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:50,484
I don't think you're shy.

390
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:58,200
Lee, I want to be frank with you.

391
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:02,621
Now, I know I'm your employer,
and we have

392
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:05,165
a prescribed relationship.

393
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:13,298
But you really should feel free

394
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:19,179
to discuss your problems with me.

395
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:23,475
Oh.

396
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:33,694
What's going on
with the sewing kit and the Band-Aids?

397
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:42,327
Lee?

398
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,041
I feel...

399
00:43:51,004 --> 00:43:52,254
- Shy.
- ...shy.

400
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,093
Do you want some hot chocolate?

401
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,095
Okay.

402
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:17,362
Why do you cut yourself, Lee?

403
00:44:22,744 --> 00:44:24,202
I don't know.

404
00:44:25,538 --> 00:44:28,123
Is it that sometimes the pain inside has to
come to the surface,

405
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:30,417
and when you see evidence
of the pain inside,

406
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:33,462
you finally know you are really here?

407
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:35,714
Then, when you watch the wound heal,

408
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:38,216
it's comforting. Isn't it?

409
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:42,471
I...

410
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:48,518
That's a way to put it.

411
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:52,647
I'm going to tell you something, Lee.
Are you ready to listen?

412
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:54,858
Yes.

413
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:56,860
Are you listening?

414
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:01,406
You will never,

415
00:45:02,325 --> 00:45:05,994
ever cut yourself again.

416
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:08,246
Do you understand?

417
00:45:09,165 --> 00:45:11,500
Have I made that perfectly clear?

418
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:14,669
You're over that now.

419
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:17,214
It's in the past.

420
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:24,596
Yes.

421
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:29,684
Never again.

422
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:34,189
Okay.

423
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:39,486
Now, you know what I want you to do?

424
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:44,282
I want you to leave work early.

425
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:48,245
You're a big girl, a grown woman.

426
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:49,996
Your mother doesn't need
to pick you up every day.

427
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:56,378
I want you to take a nice walk home,
in the fresh air.

428
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:58,630
Because you require relief.

429
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:02,634
Because you won't be doing that anymore.

430
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:04,428
Will you?

431
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:06,763
No, sir.

432
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:10,100
Good.

433
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:26,825
Look who's early.

434
00:46:28,661 --> 00:46:29,828
Mom,

435
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:34,416
I'm going to walk home from now on.

436
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:39,296
LEE: I took a shortcut through Hawkins Park,

437
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:44,301
and it was as if I'd never
taken a walk by myself before.

438
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:50,015
And when I thought about it, I realized
I probably never had taken a walk alone.

439
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:53,768
But because he had given me
the permission to do this,

440
00:46:53,853 --> 00:46:56,104
because he'd insisted I do it,

441
00:46:56,189 --> 00:47:00,901
I felt held by him as I walked along.

442
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:03,820
I felt he was with me.

443
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:10,952
At the same time, I was feeling
something growing in Mr. Grey,

444
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:16,541
an intimate tendril creeping
from one of his darker areas,

445
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:22,589
nursed on the feeling that he had
discovered something about me.

446
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:28,136
The next day, I didn't even bring
my cuticle scissors and my iodine.

447
00:47:28,221 --> 00:47:31,014
But I did make another typing mistake.

448
00:47:31,224 --> 00:47:34,434
What is wrong with you?
That is all you have to do.

449
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:37,270
Type and answer the phones.
Is that beyond you?

450
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:39,648
- I'm sorry.
- Well, it certainly seems to be.

451
00:47:39,732 --> 00:47:42,150
- I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize to me!

Peter proposed marriage to me

in the basement of JCPenney's.

728
01:29:54,097 --> 01:29:57,600
I think I said yes
because I didn't know what else to do.

Well, I guess I was a little lighter
than you in those days.
