00:02:17,736 --> 00:02:21,672
NEW KIDS TURBO

1
00:02:15,112 --> 00:02:17,069
That fucking butterfly.

2
00:02:46,002 --> 00:02:49,403
So what, dude! It's not my bike.

3
00:02:50,778 --> 00:02:52,152
I stole it from that cunt.

4
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:56,194
That homo on Horzik Street.
The short, cross- eyed one.

5
00:02:56,528 --> 00:02:59,152
Dude, I told him not to ride
on my street.

6
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:01,486
And what does he do?
He does it anyway.

7
00:03:01,653 --> 00:03:04,861
So I see him coming as I'm waiting
in the bushes. Dude, I jump out...

8
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,736
That's my grill, cunt!

9
00:03:18,903 --> 00:03:21,486
It's all bent! Do you know
how much that costs?

10
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,986
It's all good.

11
00:03:27,737 --> 00:03:29,444
I don't feel anything.

12
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:33,027
I'm doing great!

13
00:03:36,237 --> 00:03:37,444
I'm hungry.

14
00:03:40,403 --> 00:03:42,361
Just as the economy
seemed to be recovering...

15
00:03:42,528 --> 00:03:43,944
...we're looking at yet
another bad forecast.

16
00:03:44,278 --> 00:03:47,652
Economists predict a second,
even bigger crisis...

17
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,194
...named 'The Black Hole',
which will mainly affect this region.

18
00:03:50,695 --> 00:03:53,444
Difficult times may be ahead
for the people of Brabant.

19
00:03:53,612 --> 00:03:57,486
I'll keep you informed. I'm Peter Vernhout,
reporting from 's Hertogenbosch...

20
00:03:58,737 --> 00:04:00,319
Look at this.

21
00:04:00,528 --> 00:04:02,194
Jody Bernal's coming to Maaskantje!

22
00:04:03,028 --> 00:04:04,819
Who would go and see that?

23
00:04:04,987 --> 00:04:07,236
Que si, que no!

24
00:04:07,862 --> 00:04:09,527
Such a homo.

25
00:04:11,528 --> 00:04:15,236
Two grizzly's, noodles,
a fried sausage...

26
00:04:16,987 --> 00:04:21,569
...two Ricky Martins with peanut sauce,
turkey stick, a Sloppy Joe,

27
00:04:21,737 --> 00:04:25,611
...and a sausage roll,
a large order of chicken nuggets...

28
00:04:25,778 --> 00:04:27,819
...and bakpaos.

29
00:04:31,112 --> 00:04:32,236
Hey Henk.

30
00:04:33,278 --> 00:04:35,361
You forgot my fried chicken!

31
00:04:35,653 --> 00:04:38,486
- You didn't put your order in.
- I did, dude.

32
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,902
- No, you didn't.
- I did.

33
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,277
You mongoloid!

34
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:48,486
Truck driver! Honk, honk.

35
00:04:53,778 --> 00:04:55,152
Hey cunt! We're done!

36
00:04:56,112 --> 00:04:57,152
We got it.

37
00:04:58,487 --> 00:04:59,652
Take care!

38
00:05:06,987 --> 00:05:10,611
Hey Robbie, can I have one?

39
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:14,111
Are you kidding me?
I haven't eaten all day, cunt!

40
00:05:18,403 --> 00:05:20,819
Seasoned meat. He likes that.

41
00:05:25,778 --> 00:05:29,069
Stay away from my nuggets, cunt!

42
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,736
Good afternoon gentlemen.
What's going on here?

43
00:05:39,862 --> 00:05:41,611
We're drinking beer.

44
00:05:42,987 --> 00:05:45,718
According to regional law
that is prohibited.

45
00:05:45,844 --> 00:05:47,194
So hand over those beers, guys.

46
00:05:47,362 --> 00:05:48,527
No.

47
00:05:49,278 --> 00:05:52,361
Come on guys. Give me those beers
or I will have to take you in.

48
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,152
Hey dickhead!

49
00:05:55,528 --> 00:05:58,069
- You feel like running?
- Excuse me?

50
00:06:12,362 --> 00:06:14,069
Nice...

51
00:06:14,445 --> 00:06:16,194
...it's the weekend.

52
00:06:17,612 --> 00:06:20,527
Bullshit. It's Tuesday, cunt!

53
00:06:24,612 --> 00:06:27,152
No dude, it's Sunday!

54
00:06:33,445 --> 00:06:36,652
Fuck!

55
00:07:47,028 --> 00:07:49,736
Hey! What are you doing?

56
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,486
- What?
- What are you doing?

57
00:07:54,112 --> 00:07:55,402
Can't...

58
00:07:56,195 --> 00:07:58,444
- What?
- Easy dude.

59
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,902
I always lift TV's like that.

60
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:04,277
No worries, dude. I bet...

61
00:08:04,445 --> 00:08:09,069
...it will work when
you plug it back in.

62
00:08:09,612 --> 00:08:11,902
- What do you mean 'no worries'?
- No, no, no.

63
00:08:12,153 --> 00:08:13,486
I swear.

64
00:08:13,653 --> 00:08:14,819
I swear to you!

65
00:08:21,612 --> 00:08:22,736
Hey, homo.

66
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:26,319
What you're going to do is...

67
00:08:26,778 --> 00:08:28,402
You are going home.

68
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,944
And you're not coming back here.

69
00:08:42,195 --> 00:08:43,611
What are you doing here?

70
00:08:43,903 --> 00:08:46,527
Checking up on you guys.

71
00:08:47,612 --> 00:08:49,694
Where are the gardening hoes?

72
00:08:53,403 --> 00:08:55,444
What kind of an ugly thing is that?

73
00:08:57,445 --> 00:08:59,152
That's Gradje!

74
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,652
Whatever.
You don't bring it to work, you idiot!

75
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,486
- He ruined that gardening hoe.
- Yeah. So what?

76
00:09:05,653 --> 00:09:07,361
'So what?'

77
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:16,319
You know what, dude?

78
00:09:17,528 --> 00:09:20,986
You and your fucking dog are fired.

79
00:09:21,195 --> 00:09:23,152
And you too, Robbie.

80
00:09:26,737 --> 00:09:29,986
Don't talk that way about my dog, cunt!

81
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,611
You can stick that job up your ass.

82
00:09:33,862 --> 00:09:36,444
I'll go and get unemployment benefits.

83
00:09:36,612 --> 00:09:38,027
Yeah, you cunt!

84
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:51,819
Hey, Rikkert!

85
00:09:52,695 --> 00:09:54,236
You're fired, cunt.

86
00:10:00,362 --> 00:10:03,736
Hey, Rikkert, just joking.
It's a joke.

87
00:10:04,153 --> 00:10:05,569
Hey, Rikkert!

88
00:10:05,862 --> 00:10:07,902
But you are fired.

89
00:10:08,862 --> 00:10:10,402
I can only keep the best.

90
00:10:16,945 --> 00:10:20,527
And I fucked your mother in the ass.
Just so you know.

91
00:10:21,028 --> 00:10:24,069
Now go away, Rikkert. Get out, Rikkert.

92
00:10:25,445 --> 00:10:27,152
Say hi to your mother.

93
00:10:52,612 --> 00:10:55,194
Headlines: Mass dismisssal
caused by financial crisis

94
00:10:55,362 --> 00:10:58,736
I got fired today too!
Dammit! That fucking crisis!

95
00:10:59,112 --> 00:11:02,111
Anyway, I think you should
start working more.

96
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:03,694
Are you crazy?

97
00:11:03,862 --> 00:11:08,402
I'm already at the grocery store six
days a week. How much more could I work?

98
00:11:09,403 --> 00:11:11,652
I don't know. Seven days?

99
00:11:12,487 --> 00:11:17,236
What have you done in the last three
months that you've been living here?

100
00:11:17,445 --> 00:11:20,777
I haven't gotten laid. That's for sure.
-What?

101
00:11:20,945 --> 00:11:22,944
What? Am I right?

102
00:11:23,195 --> 00:11:27,777
We've been together for thirteen weeks.
And I'm only allowed to use my fingers.

103
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,902
What? Am I right?
You will have a finger, but not a cock.

104
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:36,777
It's not like you're still a virgin.

105
00:11:47,695 --> 00:11:50,819
See? Nothing. This is not working.

106
00:11:51,403 --> 00:11:53,569
Call me when you're ready to fuck!

107
00:12:00,028 --> 00:12:02,569
Jody Bernal is coming to Maaskantje

108
00:12:23,695 --> 00:12:27,444
- Do I smell poop?
- It's the bakpao he just had.

109
00:12:39,528 --> 00:12:43,069
Can I stay here?
I got into trouble with my hoe.

110
00:12:43,237 --> 00:12:44,736
Hoe!

111
00:12:47,945 --> 00:12:49,652
It's all good, dude.

112
00:13:22,278 --> 00:13:25,527
Dammit! That was the best part
of the show.

113
00:13:27,028 --> 00:13:29,277
You are foul-mouthed.

114
00:13:30,112 --> 00:13:34,236
I work, maybe you should too.
Find a new job.

115
00:13:34,903 --> 00:13:36,319
I can't see.

116
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,027
What are you doing?

117
00:13:56,278 --> 00:13:59,236
You are worthless.

118
00:13:59,403 --> 00:14:03,152
You are a weak homo,
just like your father.

119
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:07,902
That's why he left you.

120
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,736
Dude, what are you doing?

121
00:14:25,403 --> 00:14:28,152
Can I stay with you for a while?

122
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,986
My mom is giving me a hard time,
you know. I'll be good.

123
00:14:32,445 --> 00:14:33,777
You know me.

124
00:14:39,862 --> 00:14:43,027
Get off that couch!
That's my spot, dude.

125
00:14:50,028 --> 00:14:52,111
Nice ottoman, right?

126
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,569
We are live at Gerstakker in
Maaskantje, where there's a fire.

127
00:14:59,737 --> 00:15:02,819
After attempting to extinguish
the fire, the firefighters...

128
00:15:02,987 --> 00:15:06,944
...had to let the home burn down.
We have no information on the tenants.

129
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,986
All we know is that there's
a strong cannabis smell.

130
00:15:11,153 --> 00:15:13,611
I will keep you informed.
This is Peter Vernhout...

131
00:15:21,362 --> 00:15:24,277
Awesome! All buds.

132
00:15:26,653 --> 00:15:29,236
You can stay here too.

133
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:32,861
Sorry.

134
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,152
Watch me! Watch me!

135
00:15:47,903 --> 00:15:51,652
I got my unemployment check.
Money for free, dude.

136
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,986
Let's buy stuff!

137
00:16:13,237 --> 00:16:14,277
Hey.

138
00:16:16,903 --> 00:16:18,611
You're not even responding.

139
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:20,527
Fine. Whatever.

140
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:29,861
That's 112 euros and 16 cents.

141
00:16:32,195 --> 00:16:33,527
You said 112, right?

142
00:16:33,695 --> 00:16:34,986
Yes, 112.

143
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:37,736
That's no problem.

144
00:16:37,903 --> 00:16:41,152
You can make it 150.

145
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:56,027
What a bitch. She can whine...

146
00:16:56,195 --> 00:16:58,194
...but she can't fuck.

147
00:16:58,362 --> 00:17:00,319
What is her problem?

148
00:17:00,903 --> 00:17:04,402
Let it go, dude. Go fuck other chicks.

149
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:08,069
Maybe one without kids,
one who isn't pregnant.

150
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,319
I'm loving this. Hanging out all day.

151
00:17:11,487 --> 00:17:15,319
I just need to fill out the papers
for more free money.

152
00:17:15,487 --> 00:17:17,194
That's what I was thinking.

153
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:23,861
Gentlemen at pump two,
please put out your cigarettes.

154
00:17:24,903 --> 00:17:27,027
Thank you... for that.

155
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,486
Can you pay for this?

156
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:36,152
I just got work done on the car.

157
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,569
Of course.

158
00:17:43,112 --> 00:17:46,819
That's 94 euros, please.

159
00:17:47,195 --> 00:17:48,652
Get me a carton, dude.

160
00:17:54,153 --> 00:17:57,527
That will be 132 euros, please.

161
00:17:59,903 --> 00:18:01,652
CARD DECLlNED

162
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,277
O, my god. What happened?

163
00:18:05,028 --> 00:18:07,111
I go and buy some stuff
and my money is gone?

164
00:18:08,278 --> 00:18:12,319
How much do I get from those
dickheads? I can't live like this.

165
00:18:12,487 --> 00:18:14,569
Hey... Dries.

166
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:19,236
I owe you this one. We have to go.

167
00:18:21,445 --> 00:18:22,694
Take care!

168
00:18:30,778 --> 00:18:32,861
Social Security Office

169
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,402
I'm not getting enough money, dude.

170
00:18:35,862 --> 00:18:37,402
I understand.

171
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:39,361
I want you to write down our names.

172
00:18:41,237 --> 00:18:43,277
Richard Batsbak.

173
00:18:43,778 --> 00:18:45,527
Robbie Schuurmans.

174
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,861
Rikkert Biemans.

175
00:18:48,028 --> 00:18:49,736
Barrie Butsers.

176
00:18:50,445 --> 00:18:54,277
And also include that ugly ass
Gerrie van Boven while you're at it.

177
00:18:54,695 --> 00:18:57,736
Sure. And what can I do for you?

178
00:18:58,112 --> 00:19:01,694
What do you think?
You need to give us more money, cunt!

179
00:19:02,195 --> 00:19:04,944
Unfortunately
I won't be able to do that.

180
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:12,652
Give us more money, cunt!

181
00:19:35,987 --> 00:19:39,652
'Dear Mr. R. Batsbak...

182
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:44,069
As a result of the serious threats...

183
00:19:44,237 --> 00:19:48,194
...addressed to our main office...

184
00:19:48,403 --> 00:19:50,902
...we need to inform you...

185
00:19:58,487 --> 00:20:02,819
We need to inform you that as of
today you won't be receiving...

186
00:20:02,987 --> 00:20:04,944
...unemployment benefits.

187
00:20:05,112 --> 00:20:09,444
This also applies to
Mr. R. Schuurmans...

188
00:20:09,612 --> 00:20:12,694
...Mr. R. Biemans, Mr. B. Butsers...

189
00:20:12,862 --> 00:20:14,111
...Mr. G. Van Boven.

190
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:18,486
Kind regards, Chairman of the Board.'

191
00:20:22,778 --> 00:20:24,194
Goddammit!

192
00:20:25,195 --> 00:20:27,694
None of us are getting any money.

193
00:20:27,903 --> 00:20:30,777
If they want to play hard ball,
that's fine.

194
00:20:30,945 --> 00:20:35,152
Then I won't be paying
for anything anymore!

195
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,444
What?

196
00:20:39,612 --> 00:20:43,402
We won't be paying
for anything anymore!

197
00:20:44,195 --> 00:20:45,361
Yes!

198
00:20:57,695 --> 00:20:58,944
Last warning

199
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:04,902
- I don't see anything.
- Over there, dude.

200
00:21:06,612 --> 00:21:07,694
Hey!

201
00:21:09,862 --> 00:21:14,319
If I ever see you here again,
I will kill you, cunt!

202
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,152
Public Prosecutor

203
00:21:17,528 --> 00:21:20,861
Chinese? Get me a Chinese
rice table for five persons.

204
00:21:22,487 --> 00:21:24,277
That's 89 euros and 20 cents.

205
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:26,069
I don't have any money.

206
00:21:27,112 --> 00:21:28,569
Goddammit!

207
00:21:38,653 --> 00:21:40,611
- Mister Batsbak?
- Yes.

208
00:21:41,153 --> 00:21:43,194
- R. Batsbak?
- All right.

209
00:21:43,362 --> 00:21:46,027
You have a delinquent balance on...

210
00:21:46,195 --> 00:21:48,027
Truck driver.

211
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,652
Ok, but...

212
00:21:55,403 --> 00:21:57,277
Here's the door.

213
00:21:59,237 --> 00:22:01,861
Good job, dude. Here's some money.

214
00:22:02,028 --> 00:22:03,569
Ok, thanks.

215
00:22:12,028 --> 00:22:15,069
- Are you Richard Batsbak?
- Yes. So?

216
00:22:15,237 --> 00:22:17,736
Mister Batsbak. Finally.

217
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:20,902
I'm with the collection agency,
and I have some bad news.

218
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:25,819
You haven't responded
to our payment reminders.

219
00:22:25,987 --> 00:22:27,986
Regarding your delinquent balance.

220
00:22:28,153 --> 00:22:29,194
And?

221
00:22:29,737 --> 00:22:32,652
And? As a result you
now only have two days...

222
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:36,861
- I won't pay for anything anymore.
- You won't pay?

223
00:22:37,987 --> 00:22:39,569
That's not how it works.

224
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,361
Are you deaf?
I don't have money, cunt!

225
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:46,736
And if I had it, you wouldn't get it,
you asshole!

226
00:22:47,112 --> 00:22:49,069
Now, get out of here!

227
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:53,527
We can't tolerate that, sir.

228
00:22:53,945 --> 00:22:55,902
We will take care of it.

229
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:59,111
It's going to be all right.
Make a left here, you said?

230
00:23:01,862 --> 00:23:03,277
You, again?

231
00:23:03,445 --> 00:23:04,569
Wait.

232
00:23:05,987 --> 00:23:09,444
Leave me alone, dude.
You had to run to the cops.

233
00:23:09,612 --> 00:23:13,402
I don't have the money,
so you can't get it from me, cunt!

234
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:22,402
Good afternoon. In Maaskantje a person
has decided to stop paying for anything.

235
00:23:22,653 --> 00:23:28,319
When an officer and a bill collector
tried to change his mind...

236
00:23:28,737 --> 00:23:32,444
...he made it very clear
that they were not welcome.

237
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:36,819
This is a man who refuses
to pay off his debt.

238
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,819
And he can't get away with that.

239
00:23:40,487 --> 00:23:43,027
So I'm assuming
he hasn't been arrested?

240
00:23:43,195 --> 00:23:45,444
That's correct.

241
00:23:45,778 --> 00:23:48,736
But again, he won't get away with this.

242
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:52,277
If we would all behave this way,
we would have chaos.

243
00:23:52,612 --> 00:23:56,069
That cop got smashed.
Look at his black eye.

244
00:23:56,237 --> 00:23:58,152
Pussy!

245
00:23:59,403 --> 00:24:01,069
Dickhead!

246
00:24:01,362 --> 00:24:04,402
How do you deal with the situation?

247
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:08,361
I'm just doing my job.

248
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:15,944
This unusual event has shocked
the quiet town of Maaskantje.

249
00:24:16,112 --> 00:24:19,652
This is Peter Vernhout,
reporting live from Maaskantje.

250
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:22,777
Hey, Henk. What about
my four bakpaos, dude?

251
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:27,027
My god. You, again?
Get your asses out of here!

252
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,027
My face is burned
because of you, ugly cunt!

253
00:24:30,195 --> 00:24:34,236
Easy, dude. Get your hands off Gerrie!

254
00:24:34,528 --> 00:24:35,944
That's right!

255
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,527
Easy, dude. Just give us the food,
and put it on our tab.

256
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:42,069
You don't have a tab!

257
00:24:42,237 --> 00:24:44,569
Get out, goddammit!

258
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,777
Easy, dude. With you AlDS-face!

259
00:24:50,028 --> 00:24:51,402
Out!

260
00:24:53,487 --> 00:24:54,819
Where is Rikkert?

261
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:06,277
Who is he?

262
00:25:08,153 --> 00:25:10,069
This is The Dave.

263
00:25:10,487 --> 00:25:11,569
Want some XTC?

264
00:25:12,028 --> 00:25:14,902
- What did you say?
- Want to buy some XTC?

265
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:18,027
Some diamonds or mitsubitchis?

266
00:25:18,195 --> 00:25:22,611
You're probably interested in
the old school stuff. The ones...

267
00:25:22,778 --> 00:25:24,986
...that make you tweak, right?

268
00:25:26,862 --> 00:25:28,152
I got those.

269
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,236
He's my new boyfriend.
He's from Schijndel.

270
00:25:34,737 --> 00:25:36,611
Goddammit. Already?

271
00:25:36,778 --> 00:25:38,111
You fucking whore!

272
00:25:38,445 --> 00:25:40,986
You know what?

273
00:25:41,237 --> 00:25:44,111
Two can play that game.
I'm going to fuck other girls.

274
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:45,944
No problem, dude!

275
00:25:46,862 --> 00:25:48,402
Take care...

276
00:25:49,237 --> 00:25:50,527
...you whore!

277
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,736
Such a whore!

278
00:26:03,487 --> 00:26:06,319
Hi baby, are you horny?

279
00:26:06,487 --> 00:26:08,486
I am so horny.

280
00:26:08,653 --> 00:26:12,486
Good. I want to fuck you.
Can't we meet somewhere?

281
00:26:12,653 --> 00:26:14,861
Are you in the area?
In Maaskantje?

282
00:26:15,028 --> 00:26:19,444
Can't we chat for a bit? I want
to feel you inside my shaved pussy.

283
00:26:19,612 --> 00:26:23,694
That's nice.
But can't you come here?

284
00:26:23,862 --> 00:26:25,694
So I can fuck you,
and then you can leave.

285
00:26:25,862 --> 00:26:28,819
I want you to fuck me in my ass.
Very hard and deep.

286
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:32,111
You sound like a big boy.
Oh, you're so big.

287
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:35,527
Yes, you stupid whore.

288
00:26:35,695 --> 00:26:38,027
I told you to come meet me, goddammit.

289
00:26:38,195 --> 00:26:40,236
Maaskantje, close to
Den Dungen, you know.

290
00:26:40,403 --> 00:26:42,902
Oh, I'm so horny.

291
00:26:46,945 --> 00:26:48,736
Never mind!

292
00:26:48,903 --> 00:26:51,027
You stupid whore!

293
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:57,194
Adrie, you are a police officer.

294
00:26:57,778 --> 00:27:00,819
You have to show them authority.

295
00:27:00,987 --> 00:27:02,694
Nobody will take us seriously.

296
00:27:02,987 --> 00:27:07,444
Dickheads! Let me out of here.
I didn't rob anybody.

297
00:27:07,612 --> 00:27:09,152
Joost van Gaalen again?

298
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,777
We have forces coming in
from Schijndel.

299
00:27:12,945 --> 00:27:15,277
And we're going to get
these guys, understood?

300
00:27:16,487 --> 00:27:17,736
I got it.

301
00:27:30,278 --> 00:27:32,819
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

302
00:27:36,528 --> 00:27:39,152
We're with Brabant TV.

303
00:27:39,695 --> 00:27:43,277
My name is Peter Vernhout.
And this is Rene.

304
00:27:43,987 --> 00:27:46,194
Rene is our cameraman.

305
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:53,442
We were wondering if we
could ask you a few questions?

306
00:27:53,553 --> 00:27:54,494
What for?

307
00:27:54,612 --> 00:27:59,111
We did an interview here earlier. You
know, with your local police officer.

308
00:27:59,237 --> 00:28:03,819
- How much do we get for it?
- Well, that's not how it works.

309
00:28:03,987 --> 00:28:05,944
Forty euros!

310
00:28:07,112 --> 00:28:10,902
That's a reasonable amount.
I think we can do that.

311
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:13,402
- A hundred euros!
- That's...

312
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:16,194
That might be too much.
I don't think...

313
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:17,777
A thousand euros!

314
00:28:21,445 --> 00:28:23,652
How much money did you bring?

315
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,069
So... A hundred, right?

316
00:28:26,778 --> 00:28:31,652
A hundred and fifty, dude!
Don't try to screw us, cunt!

317
00:28:41,737 --> 00:28:46,152
I'm just a normal, hardworking...

318
00:28:46,653 --> 00:28:48,694
...guy, you know.

319
00:28:49,153 --> 00:28:51,902
My dog means everything to me! Gradje.

320
00:28:52,612 --> 00:28:54,694
Such a sweet dog, dude.

321
00:28:55,445 --> 00:28:57,819
He needs to eat special food.

322
00:28:57,987 --> 00:28:59,652
His intestines are sensitive.

323
00:29:01,195 --> 00:29:06,444
But I got fired, because
I brought my dog with me to work.

324
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:10,527
But he's sick, you understand?
I can't leave him at home by himself.

325
00:29:14,278 --> 00:29:16,944
That is such a sweet dog, dude.

326
00:29:20,903 --> 00:29:23,652
My god, that is a sweet dog.

327
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:27,819
And because of the crisis
it's been hard to find a new job.

328
00:29:30,862 --> 00:29:33,861
You could get unemployment benefits.

329
00:29:34,028 --> 00:29:35,986
Dude, they don't give me
enough money.

330
00:29:36,153 --> 00:29:40,152
Me too, dude.
I got fired because of the crisis.

331
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:45,694
And then I lost my wife and my kids,
because I couldn't take care of them.

332
00:29:45,862 --> 00:29:48,652
And now they don't send us
our checks...

333
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,236
...because Richard asked
for a little bit more money.

334
00:29:51,403 --> 00:29:54,861
Because he needed it to buy
special food for his dog.

335
00:29:56,153 --> 00:29:57,986
That sucks, man.

336
00:29:58,278 --> 00:30:02,361
Richard, Rikkert, Gerrie,
Robbie and Barrie.

337
00:30:02,737 --> 00:30:06,069
Five guys without a job and without
unemployment benefits...

338
00:30:06,362 --> 00:30:08,527
Are they dangerous swindlers...

339
00:30:08,695 --> 00:30:11,861
...or victims of this crisis?
You decide for yourself.

340
00:30:12,028 --> 00:30:15,444
Those asshole cops!
They are not going to give up.

341
00:30:15,612 --> 00:30:18,069
They could come after us.

342
00:30:18,445 --> 00:30:20,736
And then what?
Let them come here.

343
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:23,819
We will beat them up again,
those homos.

344
00:30:23,987 --> 00:30:26,736
Hit them in the face.

345
00:30:36,112 --> 00:30:38,402
I will clean that up.

346
00:31:06,612 --> 00:31:09,236
Doesn't that look nice?

347
00:31:57,153 --> 00:31:59,027
Richard Batsbak!

348
00:31:59,195 --> 00:32:03,569
If you don't come outside within
five seconds, we will come in.

349
00:32:18,653 --> 00:32:19,986
Dude!

350
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:29,902
Ten, nine...

351
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,944
...eight, seven...

352
00:32:36,528 --> 00:32:38,694
Goddammit!

353
00:32:46,112 --> 00:32:48,152
Hey, Columbo!

354
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,486
How many times do I have to tell you?
I don't have any money!

355
00:32:52,278 --> 00:32:54,694
You can't get anything
from a man who is broke, cunt!

356
00:32:54,862 --> 00:32:56,027
Stupid cunt!

357
00:32:56,195 --> 00:32:58,902
I won't pay for anything anymore!

358
00:33:03,445 --> 00:33:05,111
Well, ladies and gentlemen...

359
00:33:05,403 --> 00:33:08,111
The police didn't make
a strong impression.

360
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:10,819
Hey, homo.

361
00:33:11,487 --> 00:33:14,652
We won't pay for
anything anymore either.

362
00:33:15,945 --> 00:33:18,069
Hand me four more beers, dude.

363
00:33:20,112 --> 00:33:21,694
Stupid cunt!

364
00:33:33,195 --> 00:33:34,319
What do you want?

365
00:33:34,487 --> 00:33:38,736
We were wondering
if we could...

366
00:33:39,403 --> 00:33:42,069
...shoot a documentary.

367
00:34:02,195 --> 00:34:05,902
It was going well.
But then officer Wanrooy...

368
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:09,569
I don't want to hear it!
Enough excuses.

369
00:34:10,112 --> 00:34:13,611
Tomorrow a few colleagues from
Den Bosch will come to arrest the boys.

370
00:34:13,778 --> 00:34:16,986
And you will go with them.
You could learn from them.

371
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:22,777
Are you guys fucking each other?
Homo cops!

372
00:34:25,695 --> 00:34:28,486
Last night was the start of a series
of riots throughout the Brabant region.

373
00:34:28,862 --> 00:34:32,861
Incidents have been reported in Den
Bosch, Eindhoven, Schijndel, Breda...

374
00:34:33,028 --> 00:34:34,736
...and even Budel.

375
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:43,444
People refuse to be victims of this crisis,
and take matters into their own hands.

376
00:34:45,653 --> 00:34:49,861
Yesterday, this group of guys
from Maaskantje gave the example.

377
00:34:56,653 --> 00:35:00,277
Dad... I love you...

378
00:35:02,903 --> 00:35:05,527
Hey cunt! Look at this.

379
00:35:05,737 --> 00:35:07,652
This is crazy!

380
00:35:08,528 --> 00:35:10,694
What do you mean?

381
00:35:10,987 --> 00:35:13,902
Look at this fucking mess!
It's all broken, cunt!

382
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:16,736
Take it easy.
Not everything is broken.

383
00:35:16,903 --> 00:35:19,944
Look at this. This is still working.

384
00:35:25,403 --> 00:35:28,444
Goddammit,
you are such a stupid cunt!

385
00:35:28,612 --> 00:35:30,777
You are a real bum!

386
00:35:30,987 --> 00:35:33,944
Stay away from my nuggets, cunt.

387
00:35:34,278 --> 00:35:38,236
Dude, what are you doing?
Goddammit, you are such a stupid cunt!

388
00:35:40,028 --> 00:35:43,527
Barry! I know someone
who can give us money.

389
00:35:44,195 --> 00:35:47,319
Rikkert, I'm taking the car.
I'm going to Den Bosch.

390
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:50,611
Suck my cock.

391
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,944
We will pay you later.

392
00:35:58,112 --> 00:35:59,944
It's all good, dude.

393
00:36:16,862 --> 00:36:18,194
Take care!

394
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:45,652
I want it back in two days,
plus 20 percent.

395
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:50,152
Of course, dude.
In two days you will get it back.

396
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,902
My promise to you. I swear.

397
00:36:57,445 --> 00:37:01,444
Me and my buddies will guarantee it.
You don't have to worry.

398
00:37:12,653 --> 00:37:14,902
It's going to be all right.

399
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,944
Go Peter!

400
00:37:17,487 --> 00:37:19,194
You're number one!

401
00:37:23,195 --> 00:37:24,236
Take care!

402
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,319
Goddammit!

403
00:37:30,487 --> 00:37:32,694
Rikkert, your car!

404
00:37:33,528 --> 00:37:36,319
It won't work, dude.
Look at that lock.

405
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:38,111
I got the strongest U-lock.

406
00:37:43,278 --> 00:37:45,777
My car rim! Hey, cunt!

407
00:37:46,653 --> 00:37:48,486
That's a good U-lock,
goddammit.

408
00:37:54,028 --> 00:37:55,527
Hey!

409
00:37:59,112 --> 00:38:01,527
No!

410
00:38:01,695 --> 00:38:05,152
That's my Opel Manta!

411
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:07,777
Cunt!

412
00:38:17,195 --> 00:38:20,027
- What do you want?
- It's Gerrie. come to Den Bosch.

413
00:38:20,237 --> 00:38:23,152
Come to the Rompert Casino.
I found a solution to our problems.

414
00:38:24,028 --> 00:38:27,111
Due to the delinquent
status on your account...

415
00:38:27,278 --> 00:38:30,236
...your phone service
has been suspended.

416
00:38:33,237 --> 00:38:35,944
We have to go somewhere.
You can wait inside.

417
00:38:36,987 --> 00:38:39,486
And you better
not steal anything, dude.

418
00:38:43,862 --> 00:38:47,736
Gerrie has a plan.
I'm curious to see what that is.

419
00:38:47,903 --> 00:38:52,152
I lost my job, my girl
and my ride, goddammit!

420
00:38:53,028 --> 00:38:56,902
How come Barrie and Gerrie
didn't take the scooter?

421
00:38:58,153 --> 00:38:59,236
What?

422
00:39:19,945 --> 00:39:21,361
I guess we have to walk.

423
00:39:21,528 --> 00:39:23,236
Goddammit!

424
00:39:47,028 --> 00:39:48,236
Sorry.

425
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:52,027
I took a shit in my jail cell,
there's shit everywhere!

426
00:40:11,278 --> 00:40:13,944
Where did you get
all this money, dude?

427
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:16,027
No more bets.

428
00:40:16,278 --> 00:40:19,694
Hey, cunt! Tell me where
you got all this money!

429
00:40:19,862 --> 00:40:21,486
Pay attention.

430
00:40:27,362 --> 00:40:30,736
Where did you get the money?

431
00:40:33,403 --> 00:40:35,319
Red 23, congratulations.

432
00:40:41,987 --> 00:40:45,777
Goddammit! What are the odds?

433
00:40:46,445 --> 00:40:49,444
Gerrie is the man!

434
00:40:49,695 --> 00:40:51,569
But he looks like an ass.

435
00:40:53,362 --> 00:40:55,361
Black 11. Too bad.

436
00:41:03,945 --> 00:41:05,527
Goddammit!

437
00:41:05,695 --> 00:41:07,444
What a homo.

438
00:41:10,695 --> 00:41:12,486
I don't get it, man.

439
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:15,027
This wasn't suppose to happen.

440
00:41:15,195 --> 00:41:17,444
You are such a mongoloid.

441
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:21,694
This tastes good, dude. Coconut.

442
00:41:23,237 --> 00:41:25,152
Don't worry, dude.

443
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,736
That guy lives all the way
in Den Bosch.

444
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:30,486
He won't come down to Maaskantje.

445
00:41:35,362 --> 00:41:37,486
I don't have a job.

446
00:41:37,903 --> 00:41:39,777
I lost my Opel Manta.

447
00:41:39,945 --> 00:41:41,694
I lost Manuela.

448
00:41:41,862 --> 00:41:44,444
She has a new boyfriend. Homo.

449
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:50,402
All I wanted was to fuck.

450
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:53,236
Just fuck, you know. Fuck.

451
00:41:53,987 --> 00:41:56,736
That new guy probably
fucked her already.

452
00:41:56,903 --> 00:42:00,152
What about me?
No, she won't fuck me.

453
00:42:00,778 --> 00:42:04,902
Why can't I ever have sex?

454
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:07,152
For once.

455
00:42:09,695 --> 00:42:12,444
Are you a virgin or something?

456
00:42:14,028 --> 00:42:15,277
No.

457
00:42:16,528 --> 00:42:18,611
He is still a virgin.

458
00:42:18,778 --> 00:42:20,736
Hey, homo!

459
00:42:21,695 --> 00:42:23,819
Homo!

460
00:42:33,153 --> 00:42:34,236
Police - Confiscated

461
00:42:34,403 --> 00:42:37,777
Goddammit!
Who do they think they are?

462
00:42:38,112 --> 00:42:40,694
They moved quickly.

463
00:42:49,195 --> 00:42:52,152
I'm going to see Manuela.
And fuck her.

464
00:42:54,237 --> 00:42:56,902
Sure, dude.

465
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:59,111
Go and do that.

466
00:42:59,445 --> 00:43:03,152
Make sure you get
the right hole. Virgin!

467
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:33,027
You have such a nice pussy.

468
00:43:38,362 --> 00:43:42,444
I can't wait to come inside you.
Fill you up with semen.

469
00:43:42,612 --> 00:43:44,986
You are such a hot chick.

470
00:43:48,737 --> 00:43:51,444
Take care. See you tonight.

471
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:58,111
Hey, cunt!

472
00:44:01,237 --> 00:44:06,152
...I slapped her face with my
hard cock. Like this.

473
00:44:07,195 --> 00:44:08,444
She was laughing, dude.

474
00:44:14,903 --> 00:44:17,069
Truck driver!

475
00:44:17,737 --> 00:44:19,069
Honk, honk.

476
00:44:42,987 --> 00:44:45,319
There is shit on the wall.

477
00:44:47,028 --> 00:44:48,986
He didn't eat the right food.

478
00:44:53,862 --> 00:44:55,444
Isn't that sad?

479
00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:01,736
You want to drink something, Gradje?
You'll like that.

480
00:45:08,528 --> 00:45:12,694
They cut off the water too?

481
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:14,194
Cunts!

482
00:45:18,528 --> 00:45:21,694
Ground forces ready?
The warning shot means go.

483
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,944
What are you doing
with that bone, dude?

484
00:45:28,153 --> 00:45:30,319
It tastes all right. A bit salty.

485
00:45:30,487 --> 00:45:32,986
That's Gradje's bone, cunt!

486
00:45:33,487 --> 00:45:36,861
Do you know how hard life is
for that dog?

487
00:45:54,862 --> 00:45:56,319
They're shooting on us.

488
00:46:12,945 --> 00:46:14,902
Reinout Oerlemans - Producer

489
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:18,236
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have some bad news.

490
00:46:18,403 --> 00:46:22,152
We are out of money. We have
spent all the money in the budget.

491
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:25,569
I apologize. We have to cancel
the production.

492
00:46:25,737 --> 00:46:31,152
We've tried everything to get more
money, but it didn't work out.

493
00:46:31,528 --> 00:46:35,944
But to ensure that you won't leave
the theater feeling frustrated...

494
00:46:36,112 --> 00:46:39,986
...we have decided that the boys
will tell you the rest of the story...

495
00:46:40,153 --> 00:46:44,111
...so at least you know
how good the ending...

496
00:46:44,278 --> 00:46:47,361
...would have been.
So boys, come over here.

497
00:46:47,695 --> 00:46:50,736
There's the camera.

498
00:46:52,237 --> 00:46:54,569
Good luck!

499
00:46:56,070 --> 00:46:57,986
Goddammit.

500
00:47:05,612 --> 00:47:08,819
Do I have to tell
the whole fucking story?

501
00:47:10,945 --> 00:47:12,944
Gerrie, you tell them.

502
00:47:15,903 --> 00:47:17,777
I don't think so, dude.

503
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:23,527
So...

504
00:47:24,278 --> 00:47:26,319
The coppers were shooting at us!

505
00:47:26,487 --> 00:47:28,569
- Coppers!
- Yes, coppers!

506
00:47:28,737 --> 00:47:32,861
So we were running from them
and shook them off. Homos!

507
00:47:33,028 --> 00:47:37,236
So we got to the grocery store. We saw
Rikkert's girl, she was closing the store.

508
00:47:37,403 --> 00:47:41,569
She was standing there with
her naked pussy. A big one, dude!

509
00:47:41,737 --> 00:47:45,736
Don't talk shit about Manuela.
What do you mean 'naked pussy'?

510
00:47:46,903 --> 00:47:49,152
- I just thought she was naked.
- No, she wasn't.

511
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:55,402
So we hid there.
We thought the dog was dead.

512
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:58,819
Richard went home,
and found him still alive!

513
00:47:58,987 --> 00:48:01,777
He just wouldn't die.
A true die-hard!

514
00:48:15,195 --> 00:48:18,527
Such a sweet dog, dude.

515
00:48:19,403 --> 00:48:22,611
You gave him a funeral, right?

516
00:48:22,778 --> 00:48:25,986
A real ceremony, right?

517
00:48:46,987 --> 00:48:49,986
So we were at the store.

518
00:48:50,153 --> 00:48:54,402
Rikkert and Manuela were there,
she was naked again.

519
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:56,027
Dude!

520
00:48:56,403 --> 00:49:00,152
What, dude?
So Rikkert fucked her like this.

521
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:09,944
Hey!

522
00:49:10,487 --> 00:49:14,027
Virgin. Fuck!

523
00:49:16,778 --> 00:49:20,486
Hey, did you fuck her or not?

524
00:49:20,653 --> 00:49:21,777
Yes.

525
00:49:21,945 --> 00:49:22,986
Virgin!

526
00:49:23,153 --> 00:49:27,486
So she started whining of course.
Such a slut. She's been around.

527
00:49:38,903 --> 00:49:41,152
What I meant was...

528
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:45,277
...that she should have looked
after her two kids.

529
00:49:51,403 --> 00:49:53,444
Do you boys like sausages?

530
00:49:56,153 --> 00:50:00,777
The next day I went outside,
and guess who I ran into, dude.

531
00:50:00,945 --> 00:50:04,902
Peter Aerts! Such a homo.

532
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:07,069
He asked where his money was.

533
00:50:07,237 --> 00:50:09,569
What, dude? Where is my money, dude?

534
00:50:39,237 --> 00:50:40,819
Wham, wham!

535
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:48,319
That's bullshit, dude.
You were dreaming, homo!

536
00:50:48,737 --> 00:50:52,819
What were you thinking, borrowing
money from The Lumberjack?

537
00:50:53,653 --> 00:50:57,486
Dude, I came up with a great plan.

538
00:50:59,737 --> 00:51:01,569
To kidnap Jody Bernal!

539
00:51:14,612 --> 00:51:16,194
What a homo, dude.

540
00:51:16,362 --> 00:51:21,527
We had him perform anyway,
so we could steal the ticket money.

541
00:51:22,195 --> 00:51:26,819
The show was in Schotsveld, you know?
I fingered Ilona van Zoggel there.

542
00:51:26,987 --> 00:51:30,736
We ran inside. The coppers were
behind us. The place was packed.

543
00:51:30,903 --> 00:51:33,444
But they started shooting.

544
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:41,361
They missed me!
Cross-eyed coppers!

545
00:51:41,528 --> 00:51:45,152
So we ran outside.
We stole a car from this couple.

546
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,277
Rikkert got in and sat
on their baby.

547
00:51:51,112 --> 00:51:52,652
Sorry.

548
00:52:00,528 --> 00:52:05,861
What a stupid ass cop!
He ruined the van, killed a family...

549
00:52:06,028 --> 00:52:09,402
...and lost his job.

550
00:52:10,737 --> 00:52:12,069
You can stay home.

551
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,861
We were driving like crazy...

552
00:52:29,278 --> 00:52:33,111
So we were driving.
We lost the coppers.

553
00:52:35,778 --> 00:52:37,569
We shook them off.

554
00:52:43,695 --> 00:52:45,694
It is him again.

555
00:52:48,112 --> 00:52:52,027
I just found this in my desk.
Now get back to work! Peter?

556
00:52:53,903 --> 00:52:56,194
That's a nice leather jacket!

557
00:53:01,987 --> 00:53:03,652
Peter Kelder.

558
00:53:14,653 --> 00:53:16,569
So we are back on.

559
00:53:24,778 --> 00:53:26,527
We lost the cops!

560
00:53:36,403 --> 00:53:40,152
Do you hate paying your taxes
as much as I do?

561
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:45,319
Take care! I'm out!

562
00:53:45,487 --> 00:53:50,111
That was the hit show 'My name is Ronnie'.
We continue with our news headlines.

563
00:53:50,278 --> 00:53:52,527
Since the start of riots in the South...

564
00:53:52,695 --> 00:53:56,444
...there have been outbreaks
of violence in other regions.

565
00:53:56,612 --> 00:54:00,569
Incidents have been reported in the
regions of Utrecht, Zuid-Holland...

566
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:02,486
...Gelderland and Overijssel.

567
00:54:02,653 --> 00:54:06,819
It started with five guys from Maaskantje
who refuse to pay for anything anymore.

568
00:54:06,987 --> 00:54:10,361
Here are Berry and Daniel
with the weather forecast.

569
00:55:03,737 --> 00:55:05,944
The car is trashed!

570
00:55:06,528 --> 00:55:07,944
Piece of shit.

571
00:55:09,695 --> 00:55:11,069
Where is Gerrie?

572
00:55:11,237 --> 00:55:14,194
He should stay far away from me.

573
00:55:53,695 --> 00:55:55,402
Guys...

574
00:55:55,987 --> 00:55:59,444
We should keep moving. I'm ready.

575
00:56:01,278 --> 00:56:02,402
Where are we going?

576
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:07,777
Ministry of Defence The Hague

577
00:56:07,987 --> 00:56:12,277
Leave me alone, you fucking cop!
I won't pay for anything.

578
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:15,527
What city is this?

579
00:56:16,487 --> 00:56:19,444
It's actually happening throughout
the whole region of Brabant.

580
00:56:22,778 --> 00:56:25,152
Who are responsible?

581
00:56:25,737 --> 00:56:29,652
A few guys from Maaskant...

582
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:31,069
Maaskantje.

583
00:56:31,528 --> 00:56:33,777
- From where?
- Maaskantje.

584
00:56:34,153 --> 00:56:35,361
Never heard of it.

585
00:56:35,528 --> 00:56:40,736
I didn't know it either. Apparently
it's south of Den Bosch.

586
00:56:40,903 --> 00:56:43,736
I'm not paying. Bonfire!

587
00:56:46,445 --> 00:56:47,736
Maaskant, right?

588
00:56:48,153 --> 00:56:50,819
And why haven't they been arrested?

589
00:56:51,195 --> 00:56:56,944
Maaskan-tje. We're not sure why.
We're unclear on the situation.

590
00:56:57,528 --> 00:57:01,736
Anyway, the cops haven't
been able to arrest them.

591
00:57:01,903 --> 00:57:04,569
I will throw a rock!

592
00:57:08,945 --> 00:57:13,111
So if we get rid those guys from Maaskant,
everything will go back to normal?

593
00:57:16,237 --> 00:57:17,402
I would think so.

594
00:57:19,362 --> 00:57:21,611
Just bomb the place.

595
00:57:24,737 --> 00:57:26,527
Who would remember Maaskant?

596
00:57:26,695 --> 00:57:29,069
- Maaskantje.
- Right.

597
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:31,527
I had never heard of it.

598
00:57:31,695 --> 00:57:33,194
I didn't know it either.

599
00:57:33,445 --> 00:57:34,944
So we agree on that.

600
00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:38,444
That is all?

601
00:57:43,278 --> 00:57:44,444
Yes.

602
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:48,819
Oh, no.

603
00:57:48,987 --> 00:57:53,111
I heard that there is still
someone out there...

604
00:57:53,278 --> 00:57:55,819
...a cameraman.

605
00:57:56,195 --> 00:57:58,736
But that won't be a problem.

606
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:01,986
Gerrie, that cunt!

607
00:58:02,153 --> 00:58:05,819
He's acting like a child. Such a homo.

608
00:58:07,903 --> 00:58:09,486
I'm hungry.

609
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:24,527
That was big ass ball of fire!

610
00:58:24,695 --> 00:58:25,986
Bam!

611
00:58:26,987 --> 00:58:29,944
It hit Schijndel, cunt!

612
00:58:34,612 --> 00:58:38,527
Have you ever heard of a town
called Schijndel?

613
00:58:40,403 --> 00:58:41,527
Good.

614
00:58:42,612 --> 00:58:44,069
Another one?

615
00:58:44,237 --> 00:58:46,486
That is possible.

616
00:58:46,653 --> 00:58:49,277
But it will take eight hours.

617
00:58:49,445 --> 00:58:53,611
Just send our best guys, and take
them out. How many are there?

618
00:58:58,945 --> 00:59:00,069
Five.

619
00:59:00,445 --> 00:59:03,361
We will send fifty. That will bring
an end to this nonsense, right?

620
00:59:03,528 --> 00:59:05,736
- Yes, I would think so.
- Good.

621
00:59:17,362 --> 00:59:18,694
No!

622
00:59:18,862 --> 00:59:20,944
Barrie!

623
00:59:41,195 --> 00:59:43,152
That wasn't too bad.

624
00:59:43,570 --> 00:59:44,652
Where did it go?

625
00:59:51,362 --> 00:59:54,027
Look at this! Look at this!

626
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:07,819
- This is the real deal.
- Yes.

627
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:10,777
Can I see it?

628
01:00:17,487 --> 01:00:19,777
You deserved that, cunt!

629
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:22,361
Where did you get this?

630
01:00:36,362 --> 01:00:40,569
We don't know why the town
of Schijndel...

631
01:00:40,987 --> 01:00:43,861
...was attacked.

632
01:00:44,028 --> 01:00:49,444
We suspect a technical
error in Belgium...

633
01:00:49,612 --> 01:00:53,277
...accidently activated a Scud missile.

634
01:00:53,445 --> 01:00:54,902
Scud missile...

635
01:00:55,070 --> 01:00:56,236
Scunt.

636
01:00:56,403 --> 01:00:59,694
This wasn't a human error,
but a technical error.

637
01:00:59,862 --> 01:01:03,902
Goddammit, this fucking camera! I'm
going to the van, I'll be right back.

638
01:01:04,112 --> 01:01:07,236
Even though many people died,
there is no reason for a panic.

639
01:01:07,403 --> 01:01:11,319
We have declared a state of emergency,
and have sent paramedics...

640
01:01:11,695 --> 01:01:14,069
From World War ll.

641
01:01:14,403 --> 01:01:16,111
But they still work!

642
01:01:21,195 --> 01:01:22,611
Hey, virgin!

643
01:01:22,778 --> 01:01:25,319
Forget that girl, dude.

644
01:01:35,362 --> 01:01:37,694
Rene, are you with me?

645
01:02:03,403 --> 01:02:05,777
Are The Netherlands and Belgium at war?

646
01:02:07,612 --> 01:02:10,861
No, absolutely not.

647
01:02:11,528 --> 01:02:14,861
What I've been trying to explain,
is that it was an accident.

648
01:02:19,695 --> 01:02:24,069
Behind me you see the remains
of what used to be Schijndel.

649
01:02:24,528 --> 01:02:29,111
I've heard from reliable sources, that
this was not caused by a technical error...

650
01:02:29,445 --> 01:02:34,277
...but a failed attack on Maaskantje
ordered by the Dutch government...

651
01:02:35,528 --> 01:02:39,152
...to kill five guys.

652
01:02:39,403 --> 01:02:42,277
I would like to warn the people
in Maaskantje.

653
01:02:42,445 --> 01:02:45,694
Leave with your families.
It's not safe here.

654
01:02:45,862 --> 01:02:48,819
Craziness! Man!

655
01:02:49,278 --> 01:02:52,736
This is Peter Vernhout reporting
live from Maaskantje.

656
01:02:52,903 --> 01:02:55,569
Take care and good luck!

657
01:02:56,112 --> 01:03:01,361
Goddammit!
They want to destroy our town?

658
01:03:01,528 --> 01:03:02,986
I don't think so!

659
01:03:03,528 --> 01:03:06,069
Nobody touches Maaskantje!

660
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:10,277
Can we borrow that?

661
01:03:11,237 --> 01:03:12,694
Sure.

662
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:15,652
I have some more in the barn.

663
01:03:27,778 --> 01:03:30,527
You can each pick one.

664
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:47,444
Those were the good old days, the war.

665
01:03:47,987 --> 01:03:52,027
This place was packed
with Jews in 1942.

666
01:03:53,153 --> 01:03:57,777
You would hand them over to the Nazis
and they would give you anything.

667
01:03:58,445 --> 01:04:00,277
That was a good deal.

668
01:04:00,445 --> 01:04:05,361
Goebbels gave me this jacket.

669
01:04:05,528 --> 01:04:09,152
Personally! He was a nice guy.

670
01:04:31,195 --> 01:04:32,694
More weapons!

671
01:04:32,862 --> 01:04:33,902
Yes!

672
01:04:52,528 --> 01:04:55,777
Nicky, Danny, come here!

673
01:04:56,987 --> 01:05:00,069
Nicky, Danny! You'll be in trouble!

674
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:08,319
Nicky, Danny!

675
01:05:44,362 --> 01:05:46,361
Hey, cunt!

676
01:06:00,778 --> 01:06:02,402
Nicky?

677
01:06:03,237 --> 01:06:04,986
Danny?

678
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:06,652
Nicky?

679
01:06:37,237 --> 01:06:38,527
Thank you.

680
01:06:39,362 --> 01:06:40,902
No problem.

681
01:06:47,778 --> 01:06:50,069
Goddammit. Such a long drive.

682
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:17,694
Keep your hands off my croquettes.

683
01:07:17,862 --> 01:07:19,361
Get out!

684
01:07:21,528 --> 01:07:24,569
Can Manuela and the kids
stay here for a while?

685
01:07:27,362 --> 01:07:28,777
All right. Fine.

686
01:07:33,237 --> 01:07:35,236
So I take it you're not leaving?

687
01:07:35,445 --> 01:07:39,361
No, dude. This food joint is my life.
I won't let anybody take it away.

688
01:07:41,487 --> 01:07:44,236
Then I guess you could use this.

689
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:17,152
I am here to help you.

690
01:08:18,653 --> 01:08:20,361
Craziness!

691
01:08:45,278 --> 01:08:49,277
Get closer! Just aim straight, cunt!

692
01:09:07,778 --> 01:09:10,361
You did good, cunt!

693
01:09:27,945 --> 01:09:31,361
Hey, you fucking cop!
Let me out, you homo!

694
01:09:39,570 --> 01:09:42,111
Goddammit, too much recoil!

695
01:09:55,528 --> 01:09:58,027
One, two, three...

696
01:10:26,528 --> 01:10:29,027
Manuela!
What are you doing here?

697
01:10:29,195 --> 01:10:30,861
I got bored.

698
01:10:35,528 --> 01:10:37,944
So you promise that you will help me?

699
01:10:38,112 --> 01:10:40,236
And don't act weird, okay?

700
01:10:41,612 --> 01:10:43,111
Are you sure?

701
01:11:20,612 --> 01:11:21,902
Gerrie!

702
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:23,986
You saved my life!

703
01:11:24,987 --> 01:11:28,986
I am so proud of you. I couldn't
have asked for a better son.

704
01:11:34,695 --> 01:11:37,611
- What are you talking about?
- Gerrie...

705
01:11:38,737 --> 01:11:40,736
I am your father.

706
01:11:43,487 --> 01:11:45,194
That is my jacket.

707
01:11:46,695 --> 01:11:50,611
When you were little,
I left you with your mother.

708
01:11:50,987 --> 01:11:55,486
I was way too young, and I could tell
that you were going to be a loser.

709
01:11:55,653 --> 01:11:57,944
And my food joint was far more
important to me.

710
01:11:58,112 --> 01:12:01,694
I was embarrassed to have
such an ugly child. But...

711
01:12:02,112 --> 01:12:03,986
...you saved my life.

712
01:12:04,362 --> 01:12:08,694
I'm so proud of your ugly ass. I want
everyone to know that I'm your dad.

713
01:12:10,028 --> 01:12:11,236
Dad...

714
01:12:11,862 --> 01:12:13,152
Son...

715
01:12:35,862 --> 01:12:37,402
Do you want to have a turn?

716
01:12:38,028 --> 01:12:39,236
Sure.

717
01:13:11,612 --> 01:13:13,194
Cover-up?

718
01:13:34,195 --> 01:13:36,277
Richard! Richard!

719
01:13:49,028 --> 01:13:51,944
This one is for Gradje, cunt!

720
01:13:54,987 --> 01:13:56,444
Goddammit!

721
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:26,986
Drop your weapons!
Or I will shoot your friend.

722
01:14:27,153 --> 01:14:29,152
You too, mustache!

723
01:14:58,070 --> 01:15:00,194
Truck driver!

724
01:15:17,653 --> 01:15:19,819
Nobody touches Maaskantje!

725
01:15:22,903 --> 01:15:24,111
Bang!

726
01:15:29,612 --> 01:15:31,069
Fucking mongoloid!

727
01:15:35,612 --> 01:15:36,902
Hey, cop!

728
01:15:37,153 --> 01:15:40,777
You did that with your foot?
Cool!

729
01:16:00,445 --> 01:16:01,777
Dude, where's Rikkert?

730
01:16:19,278 --> 01:16:21,694
What about my boyfriend?

731
01:16:21,862 --> 01:16:23,402
He is dead.

732
01:16:25,987 --> 01:16:27,027
Okay.

733
01:16:39,445 --> 01:16:41,236
Nice tribal.

734
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:11,111
Rikkert is no longer a virgin!

735
01:17:23,778 --> 01:17:25,902
I will have to put you under arrest.

736
01:17:26,945 --> 01:17:27,986
What?

737
01:17:28,153 --> 01:17:29,444
Well...

738
01:17:30,570 --> 01:17:32,319
Unpaid fines and stuff...

739
01:17:34,362 --> 01:17:36,361
What do you think?

740
01:17:36,945 --> 01:17:38,486
Please?

741
01:17:46,028 --> 01:17:49,069
R. Batsbak, G. Van Boven...

742
01:17:49,237 --> 01:17:53,152
...R. Biemans, B. Butsers
and R. Schuurmans...

743
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:54,652
...the defendants...

744
01:17:55,112 --> 01:18:00,444
...are found guilty of the following:

745
01:18:01,528 --> 01:18:07,736
Destroying private property,

746
01:18:07,903 --> 01:18:09,861
...public intoxication...

747
01:18:10,362 --> 01:18:14,194
...drug possession...

748
01:18:14,862 --> 01:18:17,527
...disrespecting an officer on duty...

749
01:18:17,695 --> 01:18:21,902
...disrespecting an officer off duty,
indecent exposure...

750
01:18:22,070 --> 01:18:26,861
...robbery, third degree assault...

751
01:18:27,153 --> 01:18:30,402
...speeding...

752
01:18:30,862 --> 01:18:34,236
...kidnapping,
destroying City property...

753
01:18:34,403 --> 01:18:38,027
...extortion, tax evasion,
weapon possession, fraud...

754
01:18:38,195 --> 01:18:40,402
...polluting the environment...

755
01:18:40,570 --> 01:18:43,861
...unpaid parking tickets...

756
01:18:44,153 --> 01:18:46,444
...withholding evidence...

757
01:18:46,862 --> 01:18:52,861
...and 39 charges of
voluntary manslaughter.

758
01:18:54,903 --> 01:18:58,111
The court of Den Bosch...

759
01:18:58,278 --> 01:19:00,819
...sentences each one of you...

760
01:19:00,987 --> 01:19:03,736
...to 240 hours of public service.

761
01:19:18,737 --> 01:19:22,027
Brabant is quiet and peaceful again...

762
01:19:22,195 --> 01:19:26,736
...after the instigators
got their sentences.

763
01:19:26,903 --> 01:19:32,527
People have gone back to their lives,
and are coping with the damage.

764
01:19:32,695 --> 01:19:35,527
Other news. Our defence minister
has not been found yet.

765
01:19:36,445 --> 01:19:37,569
Do you remember me?

766
01:19:39,570 --> 01:19:42,277
Stupid cunt!
You owe me money!

767
01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:45,319
Shut your mouth, cunt!

768
01:19:46,112 --> 01:19:49,694
I will break your neck, dude!
Try to stop me!

769
01:19:51,487 --> 01:19:53,527
Try to stop me!

770
01:19:57,820 --> 01:19:59,944
DJ Paul Elstak!

771
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:37,150
Subrip: easytobeaman

772
01:20:40,028 --> 01:20:43,277
Don't talk about my dog like that.

773
01:20:43,528 --> 01:20:44,777
Movie theater homos!

774
01:20:53,487 --> 01:20:55,652
So you you believe... Let's start over.

775
01:20:55,820 --> 01:20:58,361
Let me out of here,
homo!

776
01:20:58,820 --> 01:21:01,861
Hey! Are you fucking or something?

777
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:16,777
She's been around.

778
01:21:16,945 --> 01:21:18,402
I don't feel anything.

779
01:21:27,112 --> 01:21:28,861
...fucking whore.

780
01:21:31,237 --> 01:21:34,319
Dammit! You ruined...

781
01:21:38,528 --> 01:21:39,569
It broke.

782
01:21:55,153 --> 01:21:57,486
Paul, dude. Add some turbo, man.

783
01:22:19,653 --> 01:22:23,652
No! My Opel Manta!

784
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:25,861
Fuck, that was to the camera.

785
01:22:39,945 --> 01:22:42,277
Hit her head, her cheek.

786
01:22:42,445 --> 01:22:45,236
Sperm splashes through the air.

787
01:22:46,487 --> 01:22:49,569
Use the fingers. Like a rabbit,

788
01:22:49,737 --> 01:22:51,694
pussy and anus.

789
01:22:51,903 --> 01:22:54,152
His mom's a whore.

790
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:56,277
I hit him in the neck.

791
01:22:56,445 --> 01:22:59,652
Don't touch my cake, dude.

792
01:23:15,237 --> 01:23:17,902
Look! I just found this in my desk...

793
01:23:18,070 --> 01:23:19,111
Let's do that again.

794
01:23:20,737 --> 01:23:23,236
I just found this. In my desk. So...

795
01:23:23,403 --> 01:23:24,444
Fuck!

796
01:23:24,612 --> 01:23:27,777
I just found this. In my desk.

797
01:23:29,487 --> 01:23:30,527
No, fuck.

798
01:24:04,570 --> 01:24:05,736
That got trashed.

799
01:24:11,278 --> 01:24:13,736
The court...

800
01:24:13,945 --> 01:24:16,569
...of Den Bosch...

801
01:24:17,403 --> 01:24:19,611
...will revoke your...

802
01:24:19,778 --> 01:24:22,111
...driving license.

803
01:24:23,028 --> 01:24:25,652
Truck driver. Honk, honk.
