2
00:04:33,868 --> 00:04:36,541
Next subject, Kowalski, Leon.

3
00:04:36,908 --> 00:04:38,785
Engineer, waste disposal.

4
00:04:38,988 --> 00:04:42,139
Five section, new employee, six days.

5
00:04:44,588 --> 00:04:45,577
Come in.

6
00:04:58,188 --> 00:04:59,223
Sit down.

7
00:05:04,268 --> 00:05:05,496
Care if I talk?

8
00:05:05,868 --> 00:05:07,699
I'm kind of nervous when I take tests.

9
00:05:07,788 --> 00:05:09,540
Just please don't move.

10
00:05:10,668 --> 00:05:11,896
Oh, I'm sorry.

11
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:18,501
I already had an IQ test this year.
I don't think I've ever had one of these.

12
00:05:18,588 --> 00:05:21,102
Reaction time is a factor in this,
so please, pay attention.

13
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:23,258
Now answer as quickly as you can.

14
00:05:23,988 --> 00:05:24,864
Sure.

15
00:05:26,188 --> 00:05:27,906
1187 Hunterwasser.

16
00:05:28,108 --> 00:05:29,063
That's the hotel.

17
00:05:29,148 --> 00:05:29,944
What?

18
00:05:30,028 --> 00:05:31,222
Where I live.

19
00:05:31,508 --> 00:05:32,224
Nice place?

20
00:05:32,308 --> 00:05:35,027
Yeah, sure, I guess.
Is that part of the test?

21
00:05:35,148 --> 00:05:37,423
No. Just warming up. That's all.

22
00:05:38,308 --> 00:05:40,060
It's not fancy or anything.

23
00:05:41,788 --> 00:05:44,427
You're in a desert walking along
in the sand when all of a sud...

24
00:05:44,508 --> 00:05:45,418
Is this the test, now?

25
00:05:45,508 --> 00:05:47,863
Yes. You're in a desert,
walking along in the sand...

26
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:49,142
...when all of a sudden you look down...

27
00:05:49,228 --> 00:05:50,263
What one?

28
00:05:50,588 --> 00:05:51,703
What desert?

29
00:05:51,828 --> 00:05:54,706
Doesn't make any difference what desert.
It's completely hypothetical.

30
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:56,744
- But how come I'd be there?
- Maybe you're fed up, maybe you...

31
00:05:56,828 --> 00:05:59,103
...want to be by yourself. Who knows?

32
00:06:00,028 --> 00:06:01,825
You look down and you see a tortoise,
Leon.

33
00:06:01,908 --> 00:06:04,945
- It's crawling towards you...
- A tortoise? What's that?

34
00:06:07,908 --> 00:06:10,183
- You know what a turtle is?
- Of course.

35
00:06:10,348 --> 00:06:11,463
Same thing.

36
00:06:11,948 --> 00:06:13,586
I've never seen a turtle.

37
00:06:16,148 --> 00:06:17,661
But I understand what you mean.

38
00:06:17,748 --> 00:06:20,820
You reach down and you flip the tortoise
over on its back, Leon.

39
00:06:20,908 --> 00:06:22,819
Do you make up these questions,
Mr. Holden?

40
00:06:22,908 --> 00:06:25,024
Or do they write them down for you?

41
00:06:25,308 --> 00:06:27,868
The tortoise lays on its back,
its belly baking in the hot sun...

42
00:06:27,948 --> 00:06:31,145
...beating its legs, trying to turn itself over,
but it can't.

43
00:06:31,228 --> 00:06:33,822
Not without your help.
But you're not helping.

44
00:06:33,988 --> 00:06:35,307
What do you mean I'm not helping?

45
00:06:35,388 --> 00:06:37,140
I mean, you're not helping.

46
00:06:37,348 --> 00:06:38,747
Why is that, Leon?

47
00:06:46,628 --> 00:06:48,505
They're just questions, Leon.

48
00:06:49,388 --> 00:06:52,061
In answer to your query,
they're written down for me.

49
00:06:52,148 --> 00:06:55,584
It's a test designed to provoke
an emotional response.

50
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,107
Shall we continue?

51
00:07:01,868 --> 00:07:05,907
Describe, in single words, only the good
things that come into your mind...

52
00:07:06,388 --> 00:07:07,980
...about your mother.

53
00:07:08,148 --> 00:07:09,581
- My mother?
- Yeah.

54
00:07:11,628 --> 00:07:13,619
Let me tell you about my mother.

55
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:32,897
A new life awaits you
in the Off-world colonies.

56
00:07:33,268 --> 00:07:35,099
The chance to begin again...

57
00:07:35,228 --> 00:07:38,026
...in a golden land of opportunity
and adventure.

58
00:08:13,188 --> 00:08:16,942
A new life awaits you
in the Off-world colonies.

59
00:08:17,348 --> 00:08:20,181
The chance to begin again
in a golden land...

60
00:08:20,268 --> 00:08:22,736
...of opportunity and adventure.

61
00:08:24,148 --> 00:08:26,708
Let's go to the colonies.

62
00:08:27,348 --> 00:08:31,466
This announcement has been brought
to you by the Shimago-Domínguez Corp.

63
00:08:32,148 --> 00:08:34,901
Helping America into the new world.

64
00:08:53,788 --> 00:08:54,982
Give me four.

65
00:08:56,948 --> 00:08:58,779
No. Four. Two, two, four.

66
00:09:02,588 --> 00:09:03,941
And noodles!

67
00:09:26,268 --> 00:09:28,623
He say you're under arrest, Mr. Deckard.

68
00:09:29,428 --> 00:09:31,066
Got the wrong guy, pal.

69
00:09:36,228 --> 00:09:37,820
He say you "Blade Runner."

70
00:09:37,908 --> 00:09:39,261
Tell him I'm eating!

71
00:09:39,348 --> 00:09:40,940
Captain Bryant...

72
00:09:43,988 --> 00:09:45,341
Bryant?

73
00:11:07,108 --> 00:11:11,101
Now on glide path.
Mark course, over the landing threshold.

74
00:11:30,108 --> 00:11:31,587
- Hiya, Deck.
- Bryant.

75
00:11:32,508 --> 00:11:35,898
You wouldn't have come
if I just asked you to. Sit down, pal.

76
00:11:36,868 --> 00:11:38,665
Come on, don't be an asshole, Deckard.

77
00:11:38,748 --> 00:11:41,308
I've got four skin-jobs walking the streets.

78
00:11:57,068 --> 00:12:00,378
They jumped the shuttle Off-world.
Killed the crew and passengers.

79
00:12:00,468 --> 00:12:03,028
We found the shuttle drifting
off the coast two weeks ago...

80
00:12:03,108 --> 00:12:04,985
...so we know they're around.

81
00:12:06,228 --> 00:12:07,263
Embarrassing.

82
00:12:07,348 --> 00:12:11,102
No. Not embarrassing because no one's
ever going to find out they're down here.

83
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,338
'Cause you're gonna spot them
and you're gonna air 'em out.

84
00:12:13,428 --> 00:12:15,146
I don't work here anymore.

85
00:12:16,148 --> 00:12:17,547
Give it to Holden.

86
00:12:17,628 --> 00:12:18,458
He's good.

87
00:12:18,548 --> 00:12:19,458
I did.

88
00:12:19,788 --> 00:12:22,666
He can breathe okay,
as long as nobody unplugs him.

89
00:12:23,188 --> 00:12:25,577
He's not good enough.
Not as good as you.

90
00:12:26,228 --> 00:12:27,661
I need you, Deck.

91
00:12:27,828 --> 00:12:30,058
This is a bad one. The worst yet.

92
00:12:30,828 --> 00:12:33,501
I need the old Blade Runner.
I need your magic.

93
00:12:35,908 --> 00:12:38,376
I was quit when I come in here, Bryant.

94
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:41,220
I'm twice as quit now.

95
00:12:41,388 --> 00:12:44,186
Stop right where you are!
You know the score, pal.

96
00:12:44,788 --> 00:12:47,018
You're not cop, you're little people.

97
00:12:58,548 --> 00:12:59,901
No choice?

98
00:13:01,268 --> 00:13:02,621
No choice, pal.

99
00:13:03,228 --> 00:13:06,140
I already had an IQ test this year.
I don't think...

100
00:13:07,188 --> 00:13:08,541
...I've ever had one of these.

101
00:13:08,628 --> 00:13:11,096
Reaction time is a factor in this,
so please, pay attention.

102
00:13:11,188 --> 00:13:13,383
- Now answer as quickly as you can.
- Yeah, sure.

103
00:13:13,468 --> 00:13:15,743
1187 Hunterwasser.

104
00:13:17,108 --> 00:13:18,746
- That's the hotel.
- What?

105
00:13:19,428 --> 00:13:20,417
Where I live.

106
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:21,384
Nice place?

107
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:22,867
Yeah, sure, I guess.

108
00:13:22,948 --> 00:13:25,462
There was an escape from
the Off-world colonies two weeks ago.

109
00:13:25,548 --> 00:13:28,016
Six Replicants: three male, three female.

110
00:13:28,148 --> 00:13:30,821
They slaughtered 23 people
and jumped a shuttle.

111
00:13:30,908 --> 00:13:32,899
An aerial patrol spotted
the ship off the coast.

112
00:13:32,988 --> 00:13:34,706
No crew, no sight of them.

113
00:13:35,428 --> 00:13:38,261
Three nights ago they tried to break
into the Tyrell Corporation.

114
00:13:38,348 --> 00:13:40,543
One of them got fried running
through an electrical field.

115
00:13:40,628 --> 00:13:42,107
We lost the others.

116
00:13:43,588 --> 00:13:46,978
On the possibility they might try
to infiltrate as employees...

117
00:13:47,068 --> 00:13:50,902
...I had Holden go over and run
Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers.

118
00:13:51,228 --> 00:13:53,139
Looks like he got himself one.

119
00:13:53,308 --> 00:13:56,539
So you look down and you see a tortoise;
it's crawling towards you.

120
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:58,380
A tortoise? What's that?

121
00:13:59,108 --> 00:14:01,099
- Know what a turtle is?
- Of course.

122
00:14:01,188 --> 00:14:02,416
Same thing.

123
00:14:02,788 --> 00:14:04,665
I've never seen a turtle.

124
00:14:06,108 --> 00:14:09,339
I don't get it. Why do they risk
coming back to earth for?

125
00:14:10,388 --> 00:14:12,948
What do they want
out of the Tyrell Corporation?

126
00:14:13,028 --> 00:14:13,983
Now you tell me, pal.

127
00:14:14,068 --> 00:14:15,899
That's what you're here for.

128
00:14:26,588 --> 00:14:28,977
- What's this?
- Nexus 6.

129
00:14:29,148 --> 00:14:30,183
Roy Batty.

130
00:14:30,308 --> 00:14:32,105
Incept date, 2016.

131
00:14:32,508 --> 00:14:34,897
Combat model. Optimum self-sufficiency.

132
00:14:36,148 --> 00:14:37,627
Probably the leader.

133
00:14:41,468 --> 00:14:42,947
This is Zhora.

134
00:14:43,068 --> 00:14:45,821
She's trained for an Off-world
kick murder squad.

135
00:14:46,188 --> 00:14:48,179
Talk about Beauty and the Beast.

136
00:14:48,308 --> 00:14:49,536
She's both.

137
00:14:53,948 --> 00:14:57,258
The fourth skin-job is Pris.
A basic pleasure model.

138
00:14:57,628 --> 00:15:00,779
A standard item for military
clubs in the outer colonies.

139
00:15:02,548 --> 00:15:06,302
They were designed to copy humans
in every way, except their emotions.

140
00:15:06,388 --> 00:15:09,221
But the designers reckoned
that after a few years...

141
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:12,141
...they might develop their own
emotional responses.

142
00:15:12,228 --> 00:15:14,298
Oh, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.

143
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,585
So they built in a fail-safe device.

144
00:15:16,668 --> 00:15:17,862
Which is what?

145
00:15:18,108 --> 00:15:19,587
Four-year life span.

146
00:15:25,868 --> 00:15:28,940
Now there's a Nexus 6
over at the Tyrell Corporation.

147
00:15:29,668 --> 00:15:31,306
I want you to go put the machine on it.

148
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:33,344
And if the machine doesn't work?

149
00:17:01,908 --> 00:17:03,387
Do you like our owl?

150
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,427
It's artificial?

151
00:17:08,668 --> 00:17:10,021
Of course, it is.

152
00:17:12,188 --> 00:17:13,587
Must be expensive.

153
00:17:15,348 --> 00:17:17,384
Very. I'm Rachael.

154
00:17:18,828 --> 00:17:19,817
Deckard.

155
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:25,305
It seems you feel our work
is not a benefit to the public.

156
00:17:26,908 --> 00:17:30,821
Replicants are like any other machine.
They're either a benefit or a hazard.

157
00:17:30,908 --> 00:17:33,376
If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.

158
00:17:33,988 --> 00:17:36,058
May I ask you a personal question?

159
00:17:38,108 --> 00:17:38,984
Sure.

160
00:17:43,588 --> 00:17:45,977
Have you ever retired a human by mistake?

161
00:17:48,148 --> 00:17:48,944
No.

162
00:17:49,428 --> 00:17:51,066
But in your position, that is a risk.

163
00:17:51,148 --> 00:17:53,059
Is this to be an empathy test?

164
00:17:54,468 --> 00:17:57,460
Capillary dilation of the so-called
blush response?

165
00:17:58,068 --> 00:18:00,662
Fluctuation of the pupil.

166
00:18:01,988 --> 00:18:04,456
Involuntary dilation of the iris.

167
00:18:06,428 --> 00:18:08,544
We call it Voight-Kampff for short.

168
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:11,899
Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.

169
00:18:12,428 --> 00:18:13,656
Demonstrate it.

170
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:16,747
I want to see it work.

171
00:18:16,828 --> 00:18:17,738
Where's the subject?

172
00:18:17,828 --> 00:18:19,341
I want to see it work on a person.

173
00:18:19,428 --> 00:18:21,988
I want to see a negative,
before I provide you with a positive.

174
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:23,706
What's that gonna prove?

175
00:18:24,908 --> 00:18:26,136
Indulge me.

176
00:18:26,908 --> 00:18:27,863
On you?

177
00:18:28,668 --> 00:18:29,703
Try her.

178
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,626
It's too bright in here.

179
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:14,666
Do you mind if I smoke?

180
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:17,060
It won't affect the test.

181
00:19:18,748 --> 00:19:21,660
All right.
I'm gonna ask you a series of questions.

182
00:19:21,788 --> 00:19:24,507
Just relax and answer them
as simply as you can.

183
00:19:32,628 --> 00:19:35,700
It's your birthday.
Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.

184
00:19:35,828 --> 00:19:37,341
I wouldn't accept it.

185
00:19:37,868 --> 00:19:40,860
I'd report the person
who gave it to me to the police.

186
00:19:43,228 --> 00:19:45,901
You've got a little boy.
He shows you his butterfly collection...

187
00:19:45,988 --> 00:19:47,944
...plus the killing jar.

188
00:19:51,548 --> 00:19:53,300
I'd take him to the doctor.

189
00:19:58,628 --> 00:19:59,902
You're watching television.

190
00:19:59,988 --> 00:20:02,661
Suddenly you realize there's a wasp
crawling on your arm.

191
00:20:02,748 --> 00:20:03,897
I'd kill it.

192
00:20:07,788 --> 00:20:09,858
You're reading a magazine.
You come across a full-page...

193
00:20:09,948 --> 00:20:11,381
...nude photo of a girl.

194
00:20:11,468 --> 00:20:14,540
Is this testing whether I'm a Replicant
or a lesbian, Mr. Deckard?

195
00:20:14,628 --> 00:20:16,698
Just answer the questions, please.

196
00:20:21,188 --> 00:20:25,386
You show it to your husband. He likes it
so much he hangs it in your bedroom.

197
00:20:27,108 --> 00:20:28,541
I wouldn't let him.

198
00:20:30,148 --> 00:20:31,103
Why not?

199
00:20:31,348 --> 00:20:33,100
I should be enough for him.

200
00:20:37,188 --> 00:20:38,621
One more question.

201
00:20:39,788 --> 00:20:42,700
You're watching a stage play,
a banquet is in progress.

202
00:20:42,788 --> 00:20:45,825
The guests are enjoying
an appetizer of raw oysters.

203
00:20:47,428 --> 00:20:49,498
The entrée consists of boiled dog.

204
00:21:06,148 --> 00:21:08,742
Would you step out for a few moments,
Rachael?

205
00:21:17,548 --> 00:21:18,617
Thank you.

206
00:21:20,508 --> 00:21:22,624
She's a Replicant, isn't she?

207
00:21:22,788 --> 00:21:24,221
I'm impressed.

208
00:21:24,508 --> 00:21:27,227
How many questions
does it usually take to spot one?

209
00:21:27,308 --> 00:21:28,423
I don't get it, Tyrell.

210
00:21:28,508 --> 00:21:29,907
How many questions?

211
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:32,058
Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.

212
00:21:33,428 --> 00:21:35,180
It took more than a hundred for Rachael,
didn't it?

213
00:21:35,268 --> 00:21:36,621
She doesn't know?

214
00:21:37,388 --> 00:21:39,185
She's beginning to suspect, I think.

215
00:21:39,268 --> 00:21:41,702
Suspect! How can it not know what it is?

216
00:21:41,828 --> 00:21:44,388
Commerce is our goal here at Tyrell.

217
00:21:44,548 --> 00:21:46,778
"More human than human" is our motto.

218
00:21:46,988 --> 00:21:49,377
Rachael is an experiment. Nothing more.

219
00:21:50,988 --> 00:21:55,140
We began to recognize in them
a strange obsession.

220
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:58,545
After all, they are emotionally
inexperienced with only a few years...

221
00:21:58,628 --> 00:22:01,586
...in which to store up the experiences
which you and I take for granted.

222
00:22:01,668 --> 00:22:05,217
If we gift them with a past,
we create a cushion...

223
00:22:06,148 --> 00:22:10,027
...or a pillow for their emotions and
consequently we can control them better.

224
00:22:10,108 --> 00:22:13,305
Memories. You're talking about memories!

225
00:22:23,908 --> 00:22:26,468
Reaction time is a factor in this,
so please, pay attention.

226
00:22:26,548 --> 00:22:28,266
- Now answer as quickly as you can.
- Sure.

227
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:30,179
1187 Hunterwasser.

228
00:22:30,548 --> 00:22:31,663
- That's the hotel.
- What?

229
00:22:31,748 --> 00:22:33,227
- Where I live.
- Nice place?

230
00:22:33,308 --> 00:22:35,219
Yeah sure, I guess. Is that part of the test?

231
00:22:35,308 --> 00:22:36,104
No.

232
00:24:50,548 --> 00:24:51,981
Time?

233
00:24:52,628 --> 00:24:53,583
Enough.

234
00:25:11,108 --> 00:25:13,303
Did you get your precious photos?

235
00:25:16,828 --> 00:25:18,307
Someone was there.

236
00:25:19,468 --> 00:25:20,503
Men?

237
00:25:24,428 --> 00:25:26,464
Policemen?

238
00:26:56,228 --> 00:26:58,662
"Fiery the angels fell...

239
00:26:59,788 --> 00:27:02,507
"...deep thunder roared
around their shores...

240
00:27:02,908 --> 00:27:05,502
"...burning with the fires of Orc."

241
00:27:08,988 --> 00:27:10,387
You not come here!

242
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:11,822
Illegal!

243
00:27:17,708 --> 00:27:20,666
Cold! Those are my eyes! Freezing!

244
00:27:32,948 --> 00:27:34,267
Questions.

245
00:27:55,948 --> 00:27:59,543
Morphology? Longevity? Incept dates?

246
00:28:00,348 --> 00:28:01,542
Don't know.

247
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:03,505
I don't know such stuff.

248
00:28:05,668 --> 00:28:09,741
I just do eyes. Just eyes.
Just genetic design.

249
00:28:10,748 --> 00:28:12,101
Just eyes.

250
00:28:14,268 --> 00:28:15,587
You Nexus?

251
00:28:16,948 --> 00:28:18,825
I designed your eyes.

252
00:28:21,308 --> 00:28:24,903
If only you could see
what I've seen with your eyes.

253
00:28:26,388 --> 00:28:27,298
Now...

254
00:28:28,428 --> 00:28:29,622
...questions.

255
00:28:30,348 --> 00:28:32,020
I don't know answers.

256
00:28:32,428 --> 00:28:33,497
Who does?

257
00:28:37,668 --> 00:28:40,307
Tyrell! He knows everything.

258
00:28:42,028 --> 00:28:43,666
Tyrell Corporation?

259
00:28:44,628 --> 00:28:45,504
He big boss.

260
00:28:45,588 --> 00:28:49,024
Big genius. He design your mind.
Your brain.

261
00:28:51,868 --> 00:28:52,823
Smart.

262
00:28:54,908 --> 00:28:56,466
Very cold.

263
00:28:59,148 --> 00:29:01,616
Not an easy man to see...

264
00:29:03,228 --> 00:29:04,502
Very cold.

265
00:29:06,908 --> 00:29:08,102
...I guess?

266
00:29:14,388 --> 00:29:15,457
Sebastian.

267
00:29:15,668 --> 00:29:17,977
He take you there. He take you there.

268
00:29:19,228 --> 00:29:20,707
Sebastian who?

269
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:26,023
J.F. Sebast...

270
00:29:31,148 --> 00:29:32,501
Now...

271
00:29:35,388 --> 00:29:37,458
...where would we find this...

272
00:29:40,588 --> 00:29:42,340
...J.F. Sebastian?

273
00:29:44,108 --> 00:29:45,780
Let's continue, shall we?

274
00:29:46,948 --> 00:29:48,506
Describe, in single words...

275
00:29:48,588 --> 00:29:52,422
...only the good things that come into
your mind about your mother.

276
00:29:52,588 --> 00:29:53,941
- My mother?
- Yeah.

277
00:29:54,628 --> 00:29:56,539
I'll tell you about my mother.

278
00:30:17,508 --> 00:30:20,466
Voice print identification.
Your floor number, please.

279
00:30:20,588 --> 00:30:23,307
- Deckard, 97.
- 97. Thank you.

280
00:30:44,748 --> 00:30:46,500
I wanted to see you.

281
00:30:51,708 --> 00:30:53,221
So I waited.

282
00:30:53,868 --> 00:30:55,187
Let me help you.

283
00:30:58,548 --> 00:31:00,186
What do I need help for?

284
00:31:02,308 --> 00:31:04,663
I don't know why he told you what he did.

285
00:31:04,748 --> 00:31:05,897
Talk to him.

286
00:31:06,188 --> 00:31:07,621
He wouldn't see me.

287
00:31:20,348 --> 00:31:21,701
You want a drink?

288
00:31:32,228 --> 00:31:34,458
You think I'm a Replicant, don't you?

289
00:31:39,948 --> 00:31:40,824
Look.

290
00:31:42,348 --> 00:31:43,940
It's me with my mother.

291
00:31:45,788 --> 00:31:46,664
Yeah?

292
00:31:53,588 --> 00:31:55,306
Remember when you were six?

293
00:31:56,188 --> 00:31:59,419
You and your brother snuck into an empty
building through a basement window.

294
00:31:59,508 --> 00:32:01,305
You were gonna play doctor?

295
00:32:02,748 --> 00:32:06,263
He showed you his, and when it got
to be your turn, you chickened and ran.

296
00:32:06,348 --> 00:32:07,542
Remember that?

297
00:32:10,108 --> 00:32:13,544
Did you ever tell anybody that?
Your mother? Tyrell? Anybody?

298
00:32:16,588 --> 00:32:20,137
You remember the spider that lived
in the bush outside your window?

299
00:32:20,228 --> 00:32:22,059
Orange body, green legs?

300
00:32:22,908 --> 00:32:25,183
Watched her build a web all summer?

301
00:32:25,588 --> 00:32:27,863
Then one day, there's a big egg in it.

302
00:32:28,108 --> 00:32:29,541
The egg hatched...

303
00:32:29,748 --> 00:32:31,340
- The egg hatched...
- And?

304
00:32:32,748 --> 00:32:35,137
...and a hundred baby spiders came out.

305
00:32:36,748 --> 00:32:38,101
And they ate her.

306
00:32:42,268 --> 00:32:43,417
Implants.

307
00:32:43,948 --> 00:32:45,461
Those aren't your memories!

308
00:32:45,548 --> 00:32:48,426
They're somebody else's.
They're Tyrell's niece's.

309
00:32:57,188 --> 00:32:58,746
Okay. Bad joke.

310
00:33:00,748 --> 00:33:02,181
I made a bad joke.

311
00:33:02,348 --> 00:33:04,066
You're not a Replicant.

312
00:33:04,188 --> 00:33:05,746
Go home. Okay?

313
00:33:09,068 --> 00:33:11,263
No, really. I'm sorry.

314
00:33:12,468 --> 00:33:13,457
Go home.

315
00:33:26,668 --> 00:33:27,862
Want a drink?

316
00:33:29,468 --> 00:33:30,981
I'll get you a drink.

317
00:33:32,228 --> 00:33:33,581
I'll get a glass.

318
00:37:15,388 --> 00:37:16,867
You forgot your bag.

319
00:37:27,708 --> 00:37:28,902
I'm lost.

320
00:37:30,788 --> 00:37:32,699
Don't worry, I won't hurt you.

321
00:37:36,508 --> 00:37:37,736
What's your name?

322
00:37:37,828 --> 00:37:38,624
Pris.

323
00:37:38,708 --> 00:37:40,380
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.

324
00:37:41,308 --> 00:37:42,297
- Hi.
- Hi.

325
00:37:46,508 --> 00:37:48,146
Oh, where were you going?

326
00:37:50,348 --> 00:37:51,337
Home?

327
00:37:53,228 --> 00:37:54,581
I don't have one.

328
00:37:58,308 --> 00:38:00,264
We scared each other pretty good,
didn't we?

329
00:38:00,348 --> 00:38:01,497
We sure did.

330
00:38:07,428 --> 00:38:08,747
I'm hungry, J.F.

331
00:38:10,308 --> 00:38:11,946
I've got stuff inside.

332
00:38:12,628 --> 00:38:14,141
Do you wanna come in?

333
00:38:14,548 --> 00:38:16,379
I was hoping you'd say that.

334
00:38:49,468 --> 00:38:51,424
Do you live in this building all by yourself?

335
00:38:51,508 --> 00:38:54,102
Yeah,
I live here pretty much alone right now.

336
00:38:55,148 --> 00:38:57,218
No housing shortage around here.

337
00:38:59,708 --> 00:39:01,664
Plenty of room for everybody.

338
00:39:11,028 --> 00:39:12,666
Watch out for the water.

339
00:39:15,148 --> 00:39:17,059
You must get lonely here, J.F.

340
00:39:19,508 --> 00:39:21,339
Not really. I make friends.

341
00:39:22,228 --> 00:39:25,265
They're toys. My friends are toys.
I make them.

342
00:39:25,748 --> 00:39:28,023
It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer.

343
00:39:28,268 --> 00:39:29,940
Do you know what that is?

344
00:39:30,188 --> 00:39:30,984
No.

345
00:39:33,348 --> 00:39:34,258
Ma'am?

346
00:39:39,348 --> 00:39:40,827
Yoo-hoo, home again!

347
00:39:47,108 --> 00:39:50,384
Home again, home again, jiggidy-jig.
Good evening, J.F.!

348
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:52,621
Evening, fellas.

349
00:40:03,908 --> 00:40:06,103
They're my friends. I made them.

350
00:40:06,668 --> 00:40:08,147
Where are your folks?

351
00:40:08,548 --> 00:40:10,106
I'm sort of an orphan.

352
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:12,300
What about your friends?

353
00:40:12,388 --> 00:40:14,583
I have some, but I have to find them.

354
00:40:14,668 --> 00:40:16,977
I'll let them know where I am tomorrow.

355
00:40:20,988 --> 00:40:22,979
Can I take those things for you?

356
00:40:23,548 --> 00:40:24,947
They're soaked, aren't they?

357
00:42:02,828 --> 00:42:05,547
Enhance 224 to 176.

358
00:42:22,308 --> 00:42:23,866
Enhance. Stop.

359
00:42:38,428 --> 00:42:39,577
Move in.

360
00:42:40,428 --> 00:42:41,304
Stop.

361
00:42:42,468 --> 00:42:44,026
Pull out, track right.

362
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:45,304
Stop.

363
00:42:47,308 --> 00:42:48,866
Center and, pull back.

364
00:42:51,868 --> 00:42:52,744
Stop.

365
00:42:54,428 --> 00:42:55,907
Track 45 right.

366
00:42:58,028 --> 00:42:58,904
Stop.

367
00:42:59,388 --> 00:43:00,662
Center and stop.

368
00:43:06,748 --> 00:43:08,943
Enhance 34 to 36.

369
00:43:18,948 --> 00:43:20,779
Pan right and pull back.

370
00:43:22,268 --> 00:43:23,144
Stop.

371
00:43:29,068 --> 00:43:30,581
Enhance 34 to 46.

372
00:43:42,268 --> 00:43:43,337
Pull back.

373
00:43:44,148 --> 00:43:45,945
Wait a minute. Go right.

374
00:43:47,468 --> 00:43:48,344
Stop.

375
00:43:49,508 --> 00:43:50,907
Enhance 57-19.

376
00:43:53,268 --> 00:43:54,667
Track 45 left.

377
00:43:56,988 --> 00:43:57,864
Stop.

378
00:44:00,348 --> 00:44:02,259
Enhance 15 to 23.

379
00:44:13,588 --> 00:44:15,544
Give me a hard copy right there.

380
00:45:10,228 --> 00:45:11,138
Fish?

381
00:45:26,468 --> 00:45:28,584
I think it was manufactured.

382
00:45:29,148 --> 00:45:30,103
Look.

383
00:45:34,108 --> 00:45:36,383
Finest quality. Superior workmanship.

384
00:45:38,948 --> 00:45:41,143
There is the maker's serial number.

385
00:45:41,268 --> 00:45:43,623
990-69-47...

386
00:45:45,988 --> 00:45:47,546
...X/B71.

387
00:45:48,428 --> 00:45:49,656
Interesting.

388
00:45:50,828 --> 00:45:53,706
Not fish. Snake scale.

389
00:45:54,628 --> 00:45:55,583
Snake?

390
00:45:55,868 --> 00:45:59,304
Try Abdul Ben Hassan.
He make this snake!

391
00:46:43,668 --> 00:46:45,147
Abdul Hassan.

392
00:46:46,308 --> 00:46:49,505
I'm a police officer.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

393
00:46:49,828 --> 00:46:52,865
Artificial snake license X/B71? That's you?

394
00:46:53,628 --> 00:46:56,347
This is your work? Who did you sell it to?

395
00:46:56,468 --> 00:46:59,187
My work?
Not too many could afford such quality.

396
00:46:59,348 --> 00:47:01,145
- How many?
- Very few.

397
00:47:01,268 --> 00:47:02,986
How few? Look, my friend.

398
00:47:03,508 --> 00:47:06,420
Taffey Lewis'.
Down in the Fourth Sector. Chinatown.

399
00:47:20,508 --> 00:47:21,577
Bartender.

400
00:47:25,708 --> 00:47:26,902
Taffey Lewis?

401
00:47:32,588 --> 00:47:33,543
Taffey.

402
00:47:34,868 --> 00:47:37,018
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

403
00:47:37,308 --> 00:47:38,297
Blow.

404
00:47:40,548 --> 00:47:42,698
Do you ever buy any snakes
from the Egyptian, Taffey?

405
00:47:42,788 --> 00:47:44,187
All the time, pal.

406
00:47:47,188 --> 00:47:48,940
Did you ever see this girl?

407
00:47:49,868 --> 00:47:51,586
Never seen her. Buzz off.

408
00:47:51,708 --> 00:47:53,539
Your licenses in order, pal?

409
00:47:53,988 --> 00:47:55,819
Hey, Louie. The man is dry.

410
00:47:57,068 --> 00:47:59,377
Give him one on the house, okay? See ya.

411
00:48:40,508 --> 00:48:41,418
Hello?

412
00:48:44,028 --> 00:48:47,020
I've had people walk out on me before,
but not when...

413
00:48:47,628 --> 00:48:49,425
...I was being so charming.

414
00:48:49,788 --> 00:48:52,700
I'm in a bar, here now,
down in the Fourth Sector.

415
00:48:54,948 --> 00:48:56,142
Taffey Lewis' on the line.

416
00:48:56,228 --> 00:48:58,822
Why don't you come down here
and have a drink?

417
00:48:59,468 --> 00:49:01,459
I don't think so, Mr. Deckard.

418
00:49:03,268 --> 00:49:04,940
That's not my kind of place.

419
00:49:05,028 --> 00:49:06,427
Go someplace else?

420
00:49:21,388 --> 00:49:23,424
Ladies and gentlemen...

421
00:49:23,868 --> 00:49:28,100
...Taffey Lewis presents
Miss Salome and the snake.

422
00:49:29,228 --> 00:49:33,221
Watch her take the pleasure
from the serpent...

423
00:49:33,468 --> 00:49:36,346
...that once corrupted Man!

424
00:50:17,788 --> 00:50:20,427
Excuse me, Miss Salome,
can I talk to you for a minute?

425
00:50:20,508 --> 00:50:23,420
I'm from the American Federation
of Variety Artists.

426
00:50:24,028 --> 00:50:25,302
Oh yeah?

427
00:50:25,668 --> 00:50:29,263
I'm not here to make you join.
No, ma'am. That's not my department.

428
00:50:29,348 --> 00:50:30,417
Actually...

429
00:50:33,828 --> 00:50:36,865
...l'm from the Confidential Committee
on Moral Abuses.

430
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:40,186
Committee of Moral Abuses?

431
00:50:40,908 --> 00:50:42,944
There's been some reports
that the management...

432
00:50:43,028 --> 00:50:45,223
...has been taking liberties
with the artists in this place.

433
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:46,423
I don't know nothin' about it.

434
00:50:46,508 --> 00:50:49,306
Have you felt yourself to be
exploited in any way?

435
00:50:49,908 --> 00:50:51,785
How do you mean, "exploited"?

436
00:50:52,068 --> 00:50:54,138
Well, like to get this job.

437
00:50:54,628 --> 00:50:58,337
I mean did you do,
or were you asked to do anything that's...

438
00:50:59,748 --> 00:51:01,784
...lewd or unsavory, or...

439
00:51:01,908 --> 00:51:04,786
...otherwise repulsive to your person?

440
00:51:08,268 --> 00:51:09,667
Are you for real?

441
00:51:11,108 --> 00:51:14,020
I'd like to check your dressing room,
if I may.

442
00:51:14,628 --> 00:51:16,698
- For what?
- For holes.

443
00:51:17,228 --> 00:51:18,058
Holes?

444
00:51:18,148 --> 00:51:20,298
You'd be surprised what a guy
would go through...

445
00:51:20,388 --> 00:51:22,777
...to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.

446
00:51:26,948 --> 00:51:28,063
No, I wouldn't.

447
00:51:28,148 --> 00:51:29,501
Well, little...

448
00:51:30,428 --> 00:51:31,941
...dirty holes...

449
00:51:32,028 --> 00:51:35,259
...they drill in the wall
so they can watch a lady undress.

450
00:52:07,468 --> 00:52:09,060
Is this a real snake?

451
00:52:09,348 --> 00:52:10,497
Of course it's not real.

452
00:52:10,588 --> 00:52:14,900
Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake?

453
00:52:28,788 --> 00:52:31,348
So, if somebody tries to exploit me,
who do I go to about it?

454
00:52:31,428 --> 00:52:32,099
Me.

455
00:52:32,188 --> 00:52:34,463
You're a dedicated man. Dry me.

456
00:55:17,588 --> 00:55:18,338
Move!

457
00:55:18,428 --> 00:55:19,861
Get out of the way!

458
00:57:01,228 --> 00:57:02,456
Deckard.

459
00:57:02,868 --> 00:57:04,381
B26354.

460
00:57:10,628 --> 00:57:13,142
Move on. Move on.

461
00:57:24,388 --> 00:57:25,503
A minute.

462
00:57:27,908 --> 00:57:29,466
Yeah, what do you want?

463
00:57:29,548 --> 00:57:30,697
Tsin-Tao.

464
00:57:38,428 --> 00:57:39,656
Is this enough?

465
00:57:49,988 --> 00:57:50,977
Bryant.

466
00:58:11,308 --> 00:58:14,698
Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad
as that skin-job you left on the sidewalk.

467
00:58:14,788 --> 00:58:16,016
I'm going home.

468
00:58:16,508 --> 00:58:18,021
You could learn from this guy, Gaff.

469
00:58:18,108 --> 00:58:21,259
He's a goddamn one-man slaughterhouse,
that's what he is.

470
00:58:21,588 --> 00:58:24,056
Four more to go. Come on, Gaff, let's go.

471
00:58:24,588 --> 00:58:25,498
Three.

472
00:58:27,428 --> 00:58:28,907
There's three to go.

473
00:58:29,068 --> 00:58:30,262
There's four.

474
00:58:31,428 --> 00:58:34,545
Now there's that skin-job you V. -K.'d
at the Tyrell Corporation.

475
00:58:34,628 --> 00:58:37,938
Well, Rachael disappeared. Vanished.
She didn't know she was a Replicant.

476
00:58:38,028 --> 00:58:40,826
Something to do with a brain implant,
says Tyrell.

477
00:58:41,388 --> 00:58:42,582
Come on, Gaff.

478
00:58:42,668 --> 00:58:44,306
Drink some for me, pal.

479
00:59:27,228 --> 00:59:28,058
Leon!

480
00:59:28,548 --> 00:59:29,822
How old am I?

481
00:59:33,988 --> 00:59:35,182
I don't know!

482
00:59:37,868 --> 00:59:40,826
My birthday's April 10th, 2017.
How long do I live?

483
00:59:41,028 --> 00:59:42,143
Four years.

484
00:59:49,588 --> 00:59:50,782
More than you!

485
00:59:55,308 --> 00:59:57,617
It's painful to live in fear, isn't it?

486
01:00:03,548 --> 01:00:06,779
Nothing is worse than having
an itch you can never scratch.

487
01:00:07,388 --> 01:00:08,537
Oh, I agree!

488
01:00:19,308 --> 01:00:21,219
Wake up! Time to die.

489
01:00:55,188 --> 01:00:56,621
Shakes?

490
01:00:58,308 --> 01:00:59,502
Me, too.

491
01:01:03,988 --> 01:01:05,387
I get 'em bad.

492
01:01:11,028 --> 01:01:12,746
It's part of the business.

493
01:01:19,948 --> 01:01:21,586
I'm not in the business.

494
01:01:34,188 --> 01:01:35,985
I am the business.

495
01:03:05,628 --> 01:03:07,061
What if I go north?

496
01:03:10,708 --> 01:03:11,982
Disappear.

497
01:03:17,108 --> 01:03:18,746
Would you come after me?

498
01:03:20,148 --> 01:03:21,217
Hunt me?

499
01:03:30,468 --> 01:03:32,060
No, I wouldn't.

500
01:03:37,908 --> 01:03:39,102
I owe you one.

501
01:03:53,628 --> 01:03:55,584
But somebody would.

502
01:04:12,148 --> 01:04:13,900
You know those files on me?

503
01:04:15,508 --> 01:04:17,100
The incept date?

504
01:04:17,268 --> 01:04:19,987
The longevity? Those things?

505
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:23,507
You saw them?

506
01:04:27,108 --> 01:04:29,781
They're classified.

507
01:04:30,228 --> 01:04:31,946
But you're a policeman.

508
01:04:32,868 --> 01:04:34,426
I didn't look at them.

509
01:04:38,908 --> 01:04:41,468
You know,
that Voight-Kampff test of yours...

510
01:04:42,068 --> 01:04:44,457
...did you ever take that test yourself?

511
01:07:21,788 --> 01:07:23,460
I dreamt music.

512
01:07:28,668 --> 01:07:30,738
I didn't know if I could play.

513
01:07:32,668 --> 01:07:34,738
I remember lessons.

514
01:07:36,268 --> 01:07:39,578
I don't know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.

515
01:07:44,508 --> 01:07:46,066
You play beautifully.

516
01:08:53,828 --> 01:08:55,580
Now, you kiss me.

517
01:08:57,628 --> 01:09:00,665
- I can't rely on my mem...
- Say, "kiss me."

518
01:09:04,388 --> 01:09:05,662
Kiss me.

519
01:09:17,148 --> 01:09:18,740
I want you.

520
01:09:21,948 --> 01:09:23,301
I want you.

521
01:09:23,708 --> 01:09:24,618
Again.

522
01:09:25,468 --> 01:09:27,060
I want you.

523
01:09:29,948 --> 01:09:32,018
Put your hands on me.

524
01:10:50,868 --> 01:10:51,778
What'cha doing?

525
01:10:51,868 --> 01:10:52,937
I'm sorry.

526
01:10:53,108 --> 01:10:54,257
Just peeking.

527
01:10:57,788 --> 01:10:59,187
How do I look?

528
01:10:59,268 --> 01:11:00,587
You look better.

529
01:11:00,988 --> 01:11:02,137
Just better?

530
01:11:03,788 --> 01:11:05,301
You look beautiful.

531
01:11:08,708 --> 01:11:09,663
Thanks.

532
01:11:16,468 --> 01:11:17,867
How old are you?

533
01:11:20,148 --> 01:11:21,297
Twenty-five.

534
01:11:22,148 --> 01:11:24,867
- What's your problem?
- Methuselah syndrome.

535
01:11:25,388 --> 01:11:26,537
What's that?

536
01:11:26,628 --> 01:11:29,142
My glands, they grow old too fast.

537
01:11:30,668 --> 01:11:32,386
Is that why you're still on earth?

538
01:11:32,468 --> 01:11:34,584
Yeah. I couldn't pass the medical.

539
01:11:37,388 --> 01:11:39,743
Anyway, I kind of like it here.

540
01:11:42,908 --> 01:11:44,102
I like you...

541
01:11:44,908 --> 01:11:46,546
...just the way you are.

542
01:11:49,148 --> 01:11:50,137
Hi, Roy.

543
01:11:52,668 --> 01:11:55,626
Gosh, you really got some nice toys here.

544
01:11:56,708 --> 01:11:59,222
This is the friend I was telling you about.

545
01:11:59,508 --> 01:12:01,897
This is my savior, J.F. Sebastian.

546
01:12:04,828 --> 01:12:07,103
I like a man that stays put.

547
01:12:08,668 --> 01:12:10,943
You live here all by yourself, do you?

548
01:12:12,148 --> 01:12:12,978
Yes.

549
01:12:24,028 --> 01:12:25,700
How about some breakfast?

550
01:12:26,428 --> 01:12:28,737
I was just gonna make some. Excuse me.

551
01:12:36,668 --> 01:12:37,544
Well?

552
01:12:40,388 --> 01:12:41,377
Leon...

553
01:12:41,828 --> 01:12:43,102
What's going on?

554
01:12:47,548 --> 01:12:49,300
There's only two of us now.

555
01:12:51,428 --> 01:12:53,578
Then we're stupid and we'll die.

556
01:12:58,508 --> 01:13:00,100
No, we won't.

557
01:13:32,668 --> 01:13:33,464
No.

558
01:13:33,548 --> 01:13:35,664
Knight takes Queen, see?

559
01:13:36,348 --> 01:13:37,576
It won't do.

560
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:48,224
Why are you staring at us, Sebastian?

561
01:13:48,308 --> 01:13:51,345
'Cause you're so different.

562
01:13:53,468 --> 01:13:55,026
You're so perfect.

563
01:13:57,828 --> 01:13:58,658
Yes.

564
01:13:59,748 --> 01:14:01,386
What generation are you?

565
01:14:10,148 --> 01:14:11,137
Nexus 6.

566
01:14:11,668 --> 01:14:13,181
Ah, I knew it!

567
01:14:13,348 --> 01:14:16,579
'Cause I do genetic design work
for the Tyrell Corporation.

568
01:14:16,708 --> 01:14:18,460
There's some of me in you.

569
01:14:20,068 --> 01:14:21,467
Show me something.

570
01:14:21,948 --> 01:14:23,017
Like what?

571
01:14:23,668 --> 01:14:24,817
Like anything.

572
01:14:27,508 --> 01:14:30,466
We're not computers, Sebastian.
We're physical.

573
01:14:33,668 --> 01:14:35,579
I think, Sebastian...

574
01:14:35,948 --> 01:14:37,506
...therefore, I am.

575
01:14:38,308 --> 01:14:40,538
Very good, Pris. Now show him why.

576
01:15:07,508 --> 01:15:10,068
- We've got a lot in common.
- What do you mean?

577
01:15:10,148 --> 01:15:11,501
Similar problems.

578
01:15:11,628 --> 01:15:13,505
Accelerated decrepitude.

579
01:15:15,908 --> 01:15:19,105
I don't know much about bio-mechanics,
Roy. I wish I did.

580
01:15:20,588 --> 01:15:22,863
If we don't find out soon...

581
01:15:23,348 --> 01:15:25,339
...Pris hasn't got long to live!

582
01:15:26,268 --> 01:15:27,781
We can't allow that.

583
01:15:30,148 --> 01:15:31,342
Is he good?

584
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:32,858
Who?

585
01:15:33,268 --> 01:15:34,064
Your opponent.

586
01:15:34,148 --> 01:15:35,422
Oh, Dr. Tyrell?

587
01:15:36,468 --> 01:15:38,618
I've only beaten him once in chess.

588
01:15:39,268 --> 01:15:40,462
He's a genius.

589
01:15:42,228 --> 01:15:43,547
He designed you.

590
01:15:45,188 --> 01:15:46,667
Maybe he could help?

591
01:15:47,988 --> 01:15:50,297
I'd be happy to mention it to him.

592
01:15:52,708 --> 01:15:54,938
Better if I talk to him in person.

593
01:15:58,908 --> 01:16:02,344
From what I understand,
he's a sort of hard man to get to.

594
01:16:03,988 --> 01:16:04,943
Yes.

595
01:16:05,828 --> 01:16:06,783
Very.

596
01:16:10,348 --> 01:16:11,701
Will you help us?

597
01:16:13,348 --> 01:16:14,303
I can't.

598
01:16:14,788 --> 01:16:16,506
We need you, Sebastian.

599
01:16:16,868 --> 01:16:18,859
You're our best and only friend.

600
01:16:32,148 --> 01:16:34,298
We're so happy you found us.

601
01:16:36,268 --> 01:16:40,580
I don't think there is another human being
in the world that would've helped us.

602
01:17:27,428 --> 01:17:29,578
66,000 Prosser & Ankopitch.

603
01:17:32,068 --> 01:17:33,023
Trade.

604
01:17:33,668 --> 01:17:34,623
Trade at two...

605
01:17:34,708 --> 01:17:36,300
Blue entry.

606
01:17:37,148 --> 01:17:39,821
Mr. J.F. Sebastian.

607
01:17:40,508 --> 01:17:42,783
1-6-4-1-7.

608
01:17:45,268 --> 01:17:46,701
At this hour?

609
01:17:47,268 --> 01:17:49,543
What can I do for you, Sebastian?

610
01:17:53,428 --> 01:17:55,259
Queen to Bishop six. Check.

611
01:18:00,068 --> 01:18:01,501
Nonsense!

612
01:18:02,188 --> 01:18:03,701
Just a moment.

613
01:18:07,268 --> 01:18:10,624
Queen to Bishop six? Ridiculous!

614
01:18:17,188 --> 01:18:18,177
Queen...

615
01:18:20,428 --> 01:18:21,656
...Bishop six.

616
01:18:27,268 --> 01:18:28,383
Knight...

617
01:18:29,588 --> 01:18:31,658
...takes Queen.

618
01:18:38,308 --> 01:18:40,264
What's on your mind, Sebastian?

619
01:18:40,868 --> 01:18:42,699
What are you thinking about?

620
01:18:43,868 --> 01:18:46,587
Bishop to King seven. Checkmate.

621
01:18:48,388 --> 01:18:50,856
Bishop to King seven. Checkmate, I think.

622
01:18:52,228 --> 01:18:54,264
Got a brainstorm, Sebastian?

623
01:18:55,188 --> 01:18:57,224
Milk and cookies kept you awake?

624
01:18:57,908 --> 01:18:59,739
Let's discuss this.

625
01:19:00,388 --> 01:19:02,299
You better come up, Sebastian.

626
01:19:19,108 --> 01:19:20,223
Mr. Tyrell?

627
01:19:24,388 --> 01:19:25,821
I brought a friend.

628
01:19:32,108 --> 01:19:35,100
I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.

629
01:19:42,508 --> 01:19:45,227
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.

630
01:19:46,428 --> 01:19:48,259
And what can he do for you?

631
01:19:49,948 --> 01:19:52,143
Can the maker repair what he makes?

632
01:19:53,108 --> 01:19:55,781
Would you like to be modified?

633
01:19:56,788 --> 01:19:57,982
Stay here.

634
01:20:03,188 --> 01:20:05,827
I had in mind something more radical.

635
01:20:07,268 --> 01:20:08,383
What...

636
01:20:09,108 --> 01:20:11,064
What seems to be the problem?

637
01:20:12,108 --> 01:20:13,223
Death.

638
01:20:13,348 --> 01:20:14,258
Death?

639
01:20:15,428 --> 01:20:18,261
Well, I'm afraid that's a little
out of my jurisdiction. You...

640
01:20:18,348 --> 01:20:20,578
I want more life...

641
01:20:21,508 --> 01:20:22,941
...Fucker!

642
01:20:27,268 --> 01:20:28,940
The facts of life...

643
01:20:30,908 --> 01:20:32,864
To make an alteration in the...

644
01:20:33,508 --> 01:20:35,976
...evolvement of an organic life
system is fatal.

645
01:20:36,068 --> 01:20:39,777
A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.

646
01:20:40,068 --> 01:20:40,705
Why not?

647
01:20:40,788 --> 01:20:44,064
Because, by the second day of incubation,
any cells...

648
01:20:44,228 --> 01:20:47,220
...that have undergone reversion
mutations give rise...

649
01:20:47,788 --> 01:20:50,985
...to revertant colonies,
like rats leaving a ship.

650
01:20:51,268 --> 01:20:52,940
Then, the ship sinks.

651
01:20:53,228 --> 01:20:55,537
What about E.M.S. recombination?

652
01:20:57,148 --> 01:20:58,627
We've already tried it.

653
01:20:58,708 --> 01:21:01,506
Ethyl Methane Sulfonate
is an alkylating agent...

654
01:21:01,588 --> 01:21:05,547
...and a potent mutagen.
It created a virus, so lethal...

655
01:21:05,868 --> 01:21:09,065
...the subject was dead
before he left the table.

656
01:21:09,308 --> 01:21:12,505
Then a repressor protein,
that blocks the operating cells.

657
01:21:12,588 --> 01:21:16,342
It wouldn't obstruct replication, but it
does give rise to an error in replication.

658
01:21:16,428 --> 01:21:20,626
So that newly formed DNA strand
carries a mutation...

659
01:21:21,068 --> 01:21:23,059
...and you've got a virus again.

660
01:21:23,948 --> 01:21:25,779
But, this, all of this is...

661
01:21:28,628 --> 01:21:29,822
...academic.

662
01:21:30,228 --> 01:21:32,617
You were made
as well as we could make you.

663
01:21:32,708 --> 01:21:34,027
But not to last.

664
01:21:35,028 --> 01:21:38,179
The light that burns twice as bright,
burns half as long.

665
01:21:38,348 --> 01:21:41,420
And you have burned so very brightly, Roy.

666
01:21:43,108 --> 01:21:44,257
Look at you.

667
01:21:44,868 --> 01:21:46,779
You're the prodigal son.

668
01:21:47,628 --> 01:21:49,823
You're quite a prize.

669
01:21:56,428 --> 01:21:57,827
I've done...

670
01:21:57,948 --> 01:21:59,540
...questionable things.

671
01:21:59,628 --> 01:22:01,380
Also, extraordinary things.

672
01:22:01,988 --> 01:22:03,546
Revel in your time.

673
01:22:08,068 --> 01:22:11,538
Nothing the god of bio-mechanics
wouldn't let you in heaven for.

674
01:23:53,308 --> 01:23:57,540
The body identified with Tyrell
is a 25-year-old male Caucasian.

675
01:23:57,668 --> 01:24:00,057
Name, Sebastian. J.F. Sebastian.

676
01:24:00,428 --> 01:24:04,706
Address: Bradbury Apartments,
Ninth Sector, N.F. 46751.

677
01:24:05,708 --> 01:24:07,983
Now, I want you to go down there and...

678
01:24:10,988 --> 01:24:14,219
This sector's closed to ground traffic.
What are you doing here?

679
01:24:14,308 --> 01:24:15,866
I'm workin'. What are you doin'?

680
01:24:15,948 --> 01:24:17,427
Arresting you, that's what I'm doing.

681
01:24:17,508 --> 01:24:21,023
I'm Deckard. Blade Runner.
26354. I'm filed and monitored.

682
01:24:22,388 --> 01:24:23,821
Hold on. Checking.

683
01:24:27,628 --> 01:24:30,222
Okay. Checked and cleared.
Have a better one.

684
01:24:41,708 --> 01:24:42,743
Hi. J.F. there?

685
01:24:42,828 --> 01:24:45,740
- Who is it?
- This is Eddie, an old friend of J.F.'s.

686
01:24:50,428 --> 01:24:52,419
That's no way to treat a friend.

687
01:27:46,188 --> 01:27:48,099
Good evening, J.F.

688
01:31:28,628 --> 01:31:31,381
Not very sporting to fire
on an unarmed opponent.

689
01:31:33,588 --> 01:31:35,977
I thought you were supposed to be good.

690
01:31:38,148 --> 01:31:40,662
Aren't you the good man?

691
01:31:45,188 --> 01:31:47,986
Come on! Oh, Deckard!

692
01:31:49,988 --> 01:31:51,057
Show me...

693
01:31:52,588 --> 01:31:54,306
...what you're made of!

694
01:32:06,148 --> 01:32:08,059
Proud of yourself, little man?

695
01:32:15,508 --> 01:32:16,987
This is for Zhora!

696
01:32:18,748 --> 01:32:20,101
This is for Pris.

697
01:32:26,948 --> 01:32:28,301
Come on, Deckard.

698
01:32:28,988 --> 01:32:31,707
I'm right here,
but you've gotta shoot straight.

699
01:32:33,108 --> 01:32:35,497
Straight doesn't seem to be good enough!

700
01:32:35,748 --> 01:32:37,101
Now it's my turn!

701
01:32:38,788 --> 01:32:41,382
I'm gonna give you a few seconds
before I come.

702
01:32:42,948 --> 01:32:45,337
One. Two...

703
01:32:57,748 --> 01:33:00,308
Three. Four...

704
01:34:22,908 --> 01:34:24,500
I'm coming!

705
01:34:31,068 --> 01:34:32,262
Four, five!

706
01:34:35,668 --> 01:34:37,306
How to stay alive!

707
01:35:00,468 --> 01:35:01,662
I can see you!

708
01:35:25,828 --> 01:35:28,422
Deckard, not yet!

709
01:36:07,108 --> 01:36:07,938
Yes.

710
01:36:15,908 --> 01:36:17,421
You better get it up!

711
01:36:18,108 --> 01:36:20,019
Or I'm gonna have to kill you!

712
01:36:20,388 --> 01:36:21,867
Unless you're alive...

713
01:36:21,948 --> 01:36:24,542
...you can't play! And if you don't play...

714
01:36:33,788 --> 01:36:35,585
Six. Seven!

715
01:36:36,268 --> 01:36:37,986
Go to hell or go to heaven!

716
01:36:42,108 --> 01:36:43,587
Go to hell!

717
01:36:45,308 --> 01:36:47,060
Good! That's the spirit.

718
01:37:26,428 --> 01:37:27,907
That hurt!

719
01:37:31,428 --> 01:37:33,419
That was irrational of you.

720
01:37:35,508 --> 01:37:36,861
Not to mention...

721
01:37:37,468 --> 01:37:39,220
...unsportsmanlike.

722
01:37:43,428 --> 01:37:44,907
Where are you going?

723
01:40:53,668 --> 01:40:56,307
Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it?

724
01:40:58,628 --> 01:41:00,823
That's what it is to be a slave.

725
01:41:58,348 --> 01:42:01,067
I've seen things...

726
01:42:01,188 --> 01:42:04,066
...you people wouldn't believe.

727
01:42:05,908 --> 01:42:09,901
Attack ships on fire
off the shoulder of Orion.

728
01:42:12,868 --> 01:42:14,904
I watched C-beams...

729
01:42:15,428 --> 01:42:18,306
...glitter in the dark
near the Tannhäuser Gate.

730
01:42:22,748 --> 01:42:26,104
All those moments will be lost...

731
01:42:28,188 --> 01:42:29,667
...in time...

732
01:42:31,788 --> 01:42:34,348
...like tears...

733
01:42:37,148 --> 01:42:38,820
...in the rain.

734
01:42:42,548 --> 01:42:44,857
Time to die.

735
01:43:48,388 --> 01:43:50,538
You've done a man's job, sir.

736
01:43:56,668 --> 01:43:58,545
I guess you're through, huh?

737
01:44:00,988 --> 01:44:02,137
Finished.

738
01:44:23,588 --> 01:44:25,818
It's too bad she won't live.

739
01:44:27,548 --> 01:44:29,504
But then again, who does?

740
01:45:01,988 --> 01:45:02,943
Rachael?

741
01:45:11,268 --> 01:45:12,257
Rachael?

742
01:45:26,308 --> 01:45:27,297
Rachael?

743
01:46:31,988 --> 01:46:33,341
Do you love me?

744
01:46:34,708 --> 01:46:35,857
I love you.

745
01:46:37,308 --> 01:46:38,661
Do you trust me?

746
01:46:40,148 --> 01:46:41,501
I trust you.

747
01:46:51,108 --> 01:46:52,097
Rachael?

748
01:47:30,828 --> 01:47:33,137
It's too bad she won't live.

749
01:47:33,668 --> 01:47:35,545
But then again, who does?
