1
00:02:03,264 --> 00:02:05,255
Today is a good day to die.

2
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:10,001
- What's happening?
- It's crack! Get some help.

3
00:02:11,372 --> 00:02:13,863
So many crack-heads,
we don't have time for anybody else.

4
00:02:15,576 --> 00:02:18,511
- What have we got?
- Some kind of hemorrhage.

5
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:21,639
- Blood pressure?
- 90 over 60 and dropping.

6
00:02:21,716 --> 00:02:23,684
- Any vaginal bleeding?
- What's he saying?

7
00:02:23,751 --> 00:02:26,720
- No money. Probably a street abortion.
- It's probably her uterine artery.

8
00:02:26,788 --> 00:02:31,248
- Come on! We gotta open her up.
- The O.R.'s are full. Maybe 10 minutes.

9
00:02:31,325 --> 00:02:33,259
That's too late. Get her under.

10
00:02:33,327 --> 00:02:35,261
- Who will do the surgery?
- I am.

11
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:37,593
- You can't!
- Just do it!

12
00:02:37,665 --> 00:02:41,066
- You're going to get us all fired.
- Get him out of here!

13
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:47,140
Fifteen years on the job,
and you'll get me canned in one day.

14
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,676
- You're crazy!
- Here we go.

15
00:02:49,744 --> 00:02:51,905
How we doing?

16
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:53,412
Forceps!

17
00:02:54,148 --> 00:02:57,049
Where is it? Clamp!

18
00:02:57,118 --> 00:03:00,053
- Get it, babe.
- You got it.

19
00:03:00,121 --> 00:03:02,487
All right, I got her!

20
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:05,253
- Dave, get out of here. Now!
- I tried to stop him.

21
00:03:06,627 --> 00:03:11,291
Labraccio! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

22
00:03:29,917 --> 00:03:33,011
Randall Steckle,
Diary of a Surgeon.

23
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,952
I'm not a surgeon yet.

24
00:03:35,022 --> 00:03:38,788
Randall Steckle,
Diary of a Surgeon To Be.

25
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,455
Wimpy. Randall Steckle,
Making of a D--

26
00:03:44,031 --> 00:03:48,331
Randall Steckle, Forging of a Surgeon.
No. Pretentious.

27
00:03:48,402 --> 00:03:51,166
Randall Steckle, Genesis?

28
00:03:54,308 --> 00:03:57,835
Randall Steckle,
Genesis of a Young Surgeon.

29
00:03:58,813 --> 00:04:00,246
Brilliant!

30
00:04:16,597 --> 00:04:18,030
Morning.

31
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,993
Nice work.
Keep it up.

32
00:04:29,577 --> 00:04:32,280
Suddenly, even though
I was in a coma...

33
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,076
Suddenly, even though
I was in a coma...

34
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:35,081
I saw myself...

35
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,517
like from above, looking down.

36
00:04:41,556 --> 00:04:46,357
Ralph, my husband,
was crying.

37
00:04:46,427 --> 00:04:49,191
And the doctor was saying
I was dying.

38
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,327
And I saw myself in the bed
and everything.

39
00:04:56,103 --> 00:04:59,698
And I started to float
out into the hall...

40
00:05:01,142 --> 00:05:03,474
and then into this tunnel...

41
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:06,847
toward this light.

42
00:05:08,549 --> 00:05:12,144
And it was the most beautiful light
I ever saw.

43
00:05:13,054 --> 00:05:15,079
And I heard this voice.

44
00:05:16,891 --> 00:05:21,123
And it was the most beautiful voice
I ever heard.

45
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,854
And it said...

46
00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:28,558
"I'm going to take your baby...

47
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:34,701
but you are going back."

48
00:05:36,777 --> 00:05:41,180
And I woke up,
and there was Ralph...

49
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,708
and the doctor.

50
00:05:44,785 --> 00:05:47,845
I was legally dead...

51
00:05:47,922 --> 00:05:50,891
for four and a half minutes.

52
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,654
But I didn't see no tunnel...

53
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,753
and I didn't see no light.

54
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:59,459
I did.
And it was so beautiful!

55
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:02,226
I was in this garden.

56
00:06:02,303 --> 00:06:04,965
And this tunnel and light...

57
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,667
and this guide...

58
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,973
and a chariot and music.

59
00:06:11,045 --> 00:06:15,106
Terry, I think they better
get you off medication.

60
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:18,584
Thanks.

61
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:25,688
- What's up?
- Good morning.

62
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,423
- There's trouble in ER. Watch your ass.
- Thanks.

63
00:06:29,497 --> 00:06:33,365
Why are you always asking the patients
about death?

64
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,493
I'll be late for class.

65
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:37,002
Thanks, Edna.

66
00:06:38,706 --> 00:06:41,072
The spoils of arthritis.

67
00:06:41,142 --> 00:06:43,975
Some rather resilient
inflammatory tissue here.

68
00:06:44,045 --> 00:06:47,344
Trying to sever--
Come on, damn it.

69
00:06:47,415 --> 00:06:49,747
We are now beneath the transverse arch
of the foot...

70
00:06:49,817 --> 00:06:52,251
the cuneiforms,
the metatarsals--

71
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,254
Brilliant, Dr.Steckle.

72
00:06:54,322 --> 00:06:57,553
Be sure to bring all that talent
with you tonight, okay?

73
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,923
Nelson, about tonight.

74
00:06:59,994 --> 00:07:04,021
Because I like you as much as I do,
I have to decline on moral grounds.

75
00:07:04,098 --> 00:07:08,432
Isn't there enough atrocity in the world
without your own horror?

76
00:07:08,502 --> 00:07:11,528
Horror?
It's ignorance we fear.

77
00:07:11,605 --> 00:07:14,597
Since when did truth and knowledge
become a horror?

78
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:19,511
Especially to a scientist
and a genius like yourself.

79
00:07:28,556 --> 00:07:30,581
Good morning, Manus.
How you doing?

80
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:32,758
Fine.

81
00:07:33,728 --> 00:07:36,561
I've been meaning to ask,
are you dating anyone?

82
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:40,225
- Identify.
- Costodiaphragmatic recess.

83
00:07:41,535 --> 00:07:44,561
Is it offensive
if I make conversation?

84
00:07:44,638 --> 00:07:46,970
Sometimes it's nice to open up.

85
00:07:47,942 --> 00:07:49,876
Like Lenny here.
He's open.

86
00:07:49,944 --> 00:07:52,037
- Identify.
- Pylorus.

87
00:07:52,113 --> 00:07:56,482
I've heard all the rumors
and nicknames about you, Rachel.

88
00:07:58,085 --> 00:08:00,781
I'm sure you're a very warm woman.

89
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,415
Not the least bit frigid or repressed.

90
00:08:05,926 --> 00:08:08,417
- Identify.
- Your brains.

91
00:08:08,496 --> 00:08:10,225
Good.

92
00:08:10,297 --> 00:08:13,630
Want to come to my place
where we can do more serious thinking?

93
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:16,966
Excuse me, Dr.Hurley.
I need a word with Dr.Manus.

94
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,471
Sure.

95
00:08:21,008 --> 00:08:22,737
I said no.

96
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:27,338
I've already got Steckle and Hurley,
two of the top GPA's in the school.

97
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:32,049
All you need to do is handle
the injections and the IV.

98
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:36,078
Forget it. I have no interest
in watching you kill yourself.

99
00:08:37,158 --> 00:08:39,752
I think you do.

100
00:08:39,827 --> 00:08:41,795
Good morning, class.

101
00:08:41,862 --> 00:08:44,626
Today's exam will be scaled.

102
00:08:44,698 --> 00:08:48,099
Three A's will be given,
five B's, ten C's...

103
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:51,468
and the remaining four
will get D's and F's.

104
00:08:53,007 --> 00:08:55,532
Once again, as in life...

105
00:08:55,609 --> 00:08:59,375
you are not in competition with me,
yourself or this exam...

106
00:08:59,447 --> 00:09:01,381
but with each other.

107
00:09:01,449 --> 00:09:03,440
Piece of cake.

108
00:09:03,517 --> 00:09:08,216
There are others here who would like
to make a name for themselves off this.

109
00:09:08,289 --> 00:09:12,953
Seems a shame that the people
with the ability don't have the nerve.

110
00:09:13,027 --> 00:09:15,154
We'll be there.

111
00:09:15,229 --> 00:09:17,288
Speak for yourself, Joseph.

112
00:09:17,364 --> 00:09:19,628
It'll be dramatic.

113
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,067
You'll cry, faint, puke at best.
But then what?

114
00:09:23,137 --> 00:09:26,129
Frankly, I don't think
you have the balls.

115
00:09:26,207 --> 00:09:28,869
You just bring the equipment.

116
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,070
I'll bring my balls.

117
00:09:31,145 --> 00:09:33,579
Did you hear about Labraccio?

118
00:09:37,585 --> 00:09:41,282
It's a four-month suspension.
It won't even affect your scholarship.

119
00:09:41,355 --> 00:09:43,880
Forget it!
I'm outta here.

120
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:47,853
You're the best student
this school's ever had.

121
00:09:47,928 --> 00:09:52,228
They don't let a guy like you walk away
from medicine. Besides, you were wrong.

122
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:55,393
Goddamn it, she was dying!

123
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:58,768
I saved her life.
What would you have done?

124
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:00,932
Why take it personally?

125
00:10:01,008 --> 00:10:05,502
Of course they'll make you an example.
They have to protect their insurance.

126
00:10:05,579 --> 00:10:07,911
They'll ask you back next term.

127
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:11,577
Doesn't matter. Given
the same situation, I would do it again.

128
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,176
I know.

129
00:10:14,455 --> 00:10:17,015
That's why I need you there tonight.

130
00:10:17,091 --> 00:10:21,460
There are a few people I would like
to kill, but you are not one of them.

131
00:10:23,531 --> 00:10:25,590
I don't want to die.

132
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:30,000
I want to come back
with the answers to death and life.

133
00:10:31,205 --> 00:10:33,139
I can get there with the others.

134
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,301
But I need you.

135
00:10:36,377 --> 00:10:40,279
I need you to bring me back.
Please.

136
00:10:42,783 --> 00:10:44,717
I'm sorry. I can't do that.

137
00:10:48,422 --> 00:10:51,653
Great. Why don't you just walk away?

138
00:10:51,725 --> 00:10:53,886
Go climb a mountain.

139
00:10:53,961 --> 00:10:58,398
I don't understand you. You burned
your career today on a stranger.

140
00:10:58,465 --> 00:11:02,060
Now you're turning your back
on a friend.

141
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:17,650
I'm real sorry about
what happened today. I really am.

142
00:11:18,986 --> 00:11:21,284
What are my chances of making it back
without you?

143
00:11:21,355 --> 00:11:23,585
So don't do it.

144
00:11:39,974 --> 00:11:41,908
What if it works?

145
00:11:55,656 --> 00:11:57,089
Hi.

146
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:19,379
I don't want to be buried on Saturday.

147
00:12:19,446 --> 00:12:24,406
It costs $150 more
to be buried on Saturday.

148
00:12:26,086 --> 00:12:29,385
Mrs.Amsler,
you're doing much better.

149
00:13:14,635 --> 00:13:17,627
Leave a message after the beep.

150
00:13:17,705 --> 00:13:19,639
Dr.Hurley, I know you're home.

151
00:13:19,707 --> 00:13:22,198
Don't be late.
Don't forget the camera.

152
00:13:22,276 --> 00:13:23,709
What camera?

153
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:41,647
The bed.
Thank God he called a specialist.

154
00:14:41,722 --> 00:14:43,383
No lectures.

155
00:14:43,457 --> 00:14:46,290
Why did I expect that after
you got engaged you might grow up?

156
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,885
Did it dawn on you
I'm trying to work things out...

157
00:14:48,962 --> 00:14:52,056
recording adventures
before a life of monogamy?

158
00:14:52,132 --> 00:14:53,724
It never dawned on me.

159
00:14:53,801 --> 00:14:57,134
But the words "pussy marauder"
do pop into mind occasionally.

160
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,870
What the hell are we doing here?

161
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:05,036
This is good-bye med school,
good-bye career.

162
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:09,139
Chill out. $10 says he doesn't do it.
Shits his drawers and we're out of here.

163
00:15:09,216 --> 00:15:12,674
Not those lights!
Security will come running.

164
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:17,685
Set up over the grate.
I got the boiler going.

165
00:15:17,758 --> 00:15:21,250
- You really gonna do this?
- Just humor the man.

166
00:15:22,229 --> 00:15:26,188
Take me down with nitrous, sodium
pentathol and a refrigerated blanket.

167
00:15:26,266 --> 00:15:29,531
I've got chilled D5W in the cooler.

168
00:15:29,603 --> 00:15:35,371
When my body temperature hits 86 degrees
you'll hit me with 200 joules.

169
00:15:35,442 --> 00:15:38,036
The electric current will stop my heart.
When the heart is dead...

170
00:15:38,111 --> 00:15:40,045
take the mask off.

171
00:15:40,113 --> 00:15:41,580
Where's Manus?

172
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,250
Shut the door.

173
00:15:45,385 --> 00:15:47,910
I'm going to draw 20cc's.
You handle the injections.

174
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:51,924
When the EEG flatlines and
the brain is dead, I'll be exploring.

175
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:55,519
Give me 30 seconds.
Put the blanket on to warm.

176
00:15:55,596 --> 00:15:58,429
Take me up to 93 degrees slowly.

177
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,524
Inject 1cc of adrenaline.

178
00:16:00,601 --> 00:16:03,900
At one minute, Joe,
come in with the defibs...

179
00:16:03,971 --> 00:16:06,439
and bring me back to life.

180
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,566
With brain damage.

181
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:14,405
Resembling in many ways
a Cabbage Patch doll.

182
00:16:14,481 --> 00:16:17,541
Not with a body temperature
of 86 degrees.

183
00:16:21,255 --> 00:16:25,589
Dr.Manus,
will you handle the injections?

184
00:16:30,264 --> 00:16:34,928
Wait a minute. Quite simply,
why are you doing this?

185
00:16:35,002 --> 00:16:38,403
To see if there's anything out there
beyond death.

186
00:16:38,472 --> 00:16:41,441
Philosophy failed.
Religion failed.

187
00:16:41,508 --> 00:16:43,976
Now it's up to the physical sciences.

188
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:46,569
I think mankind deserves to know.

189
00:16:46,647 --> 00:16:49,138
You're doing this for mankind?

190
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:53,983
This letter absolves you
of any responsibility just in case.

191
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,614
This isn't for mankind.
This is for Nelson.

192
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:58,988
Why do I see you on 60 Minutes...

193
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:01,960
sandwiched between Andy Rooney
and a commercial?

194
00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:07,023
Tonight, a young medical student who
dared to experience death and come back.

195
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,796
- Fame is inevitable.
- That's the wrong reason.

196
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,895
It's the right idea.

197
00:17:11,972 --> 00:17:14,497
Dr.Hurley, electrodes.
Come on, Joe.

198
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:17,442
Don't you want to be
on 60 minutes?

199
00:17:20,948 --> 00:17:24,611
Rachel, how about a little nitrous?

200
00:17:24,685 --> 00:17:27,347
At least I get to go out
with a laugh.

201
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,690
Get the blanket.

202
00:17:37,364 --> 00:17:41,630
We're all professionals.
I'm sure this will go smoothly.

203
00:17:41,702 --> 00:17:44,728
If you die, can I have your apartment?

204
00:17:44,805 --> 00:17:47,069
It's a joke. It's a joke!

205
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,573
One minute.

206
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,837
Don't be late.

207
00:17:51,912 --> 00:17:53,345
Start filming.

208
00:17:53,413 --> 00:17:57,315
We'll have a complete record
of the experiment.

209
00:17:57,384 --> 00:18:00,319
Promise me you'll go through with this.

210
00:18:09,663 --> 00:18:12,530
One kiss good-bye?

211
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:14,328
I'll see you soon.

212
00:18:25,212 --> 00:18:27,407
96 degrees.

213
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:31,178
This letter does not mean shit.
Please, let him sleep it off.

214
00:18:31,251 --> 00:18:33,549
He'll have a wet dream
and think he went to heaven.

215
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:37,215
- Good idea. Good night, Nelson.
- Now I know why I'm here.

216
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:40,782
I've expressed myself clearly
for the record. Good night.

217
00:18:40,861 --> 00:18:43,193
Steckle's right.
Are you willing to risk everything?

218
00:18:43,263 --> 00:18:46,027
Med school, your future
for Nelson's fame?

219
00:18:48,235 --> 00:18:50,897
- Someone's coming.
- Oh, shit!

220
00:18:55,242 --> 00:18:57,574
- Is he dead?
- He's only sleeping.

221
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:01,071
Talk some sense into these people.

222
00:19:01,148 --> 00:19:04,049
- I'll do it.
- What?

223
00:19:04,117 --> 00:19:06,608
- You taking over?
- I've got nothing to lose.

224
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:09,815
- Just his life!
- I can get him back.

225
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:13,382
Just stop his heart.
One minute, bring him right back.

226
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,655
Don't think I couldn't have.

227
00:19:23,737 --> 00:19:25,705
Clear.

228
00:19:25,772 --> 00:19:27,740
What are you doing?

229
00:19:27,808 --> 00:19:30,402
- Systole.
- You are killing him.

230
00:19:30,477 --> 00:19:33,071
It's called murder.
No wonder you got tossed.

231
00:19:33,146 --> 00:19:35,580
This is not the shit I want
on my transcript.

232
00:19:35,649 --> 00:19:37,139
Please, don't.

233
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:39,913
Don't do any more.
I did not come to medical school...

234
00:19:39,986 --> 00:19:42,454
to murder my classmates,
no matter how deranged they might be.

235
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:46,984
Flatline.

236
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,632
They're getting smaller.
He's dying.

237
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,003
Brain death.

238
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,868
Now it's real.

239
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,965
Start filming.

240
00:20:02,042 --> 00:20:05,011
Let me defib him.
He's dead. Isn't that enough?

241
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:07,342
Let me try to bring him back.

242
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,382
Just watch the door.

243
00:20:09,449 --> 00:20:12,145
Excuse me. I don't want to ruin
anybody's evening...

244
00:20:12,219 --> 00:20:14,346
but are we in a room
with a dead man?

245
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:17,515
- Oh, my God!
- One minute to go.

246
00:20:18,492 --> 00:20:20,460
Start filming.

247
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:04,028
- Thirty seconds to go.
- Let's heat him up.

248
00:21:28,128 --> 00:21:30,187
Twenty seconds at 89, 90.

249
00:21:30,263 --> 00:21:33,460
Standing by with sodium bicarb and Eppy.
I'm charging the paddles.

250
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,271
Charged.

251
00:21:43,977 --> 00:21:45,968
Monitor the EKG.

252
00:21:51,551 --> 00:21:55,419
- Body temp 93 degrees.
- Here we go. Clear.

253
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:04,123
- What have we got?
- Not a goddamn thing!

254
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:06,324
Up me to 300.

255
00:22:06,399 --> 00:22:07,832
Charge.

256
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:11,469
Clear!

257
00:22:15,742 --> 00:22:18,006
Begin CPR.
1-1,000.

258
00:22:18,078 --> 00:22:20,012
- 2-1,000.
- Bicarb and Eppy in.

259
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,243
Bag him. 4-1,000. 5-1,000.
Breathe.

260
00:22:23,316 --> 00:22:27,343
2-1,000. 3-1,000. 4-1,000.

261
00:22:30,857 --> 00:22:32,415
3-1,000. 4-1,000.

262
00:22:32,492 --> 00:22:35,950
- Look. Not a goddamn thing!
- 5-1,000. Breathe!

263
00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:38,395
- 98 degrees.
- Hit him again.

264
00:22:38,465 --> 00:22:40,023
350. Clear!

265
00:22:42,636 --> 00:22:44,069
Nothing.

266
00:22:49,709 --> 00:22:51,677
Got him!

267
00:22:53,213 --> 00:22:56,376
- 02 up. Help me.
- More Eppy.

268
00:22:58,518 --> 00:22:59,951
In!

269
00:23:11,364 --> 00:23:14,458
REM.
We got REM.

270
00:23:22,809 --> 00:23:25,676
Nelson, can you hear us?

271
00:23:26,646 --> 00:23:28,409
Welcome back.

272
00:23:28,481 --> 00:23:31,609
Nelson, you crazy motherfucker!
You did it!

273
00:23:33,053 --> 00:23:35,783
Jesus Christ!

274
00:23:35,855 --> 00:23:39,814
That's some bedside manner.
You're gonna make one hell of a doctor.

275
00:23:41,194 --> 00:23:42,627
Suck me.

276
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,452
Can you recall a specific emotion...

277
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,216
or sensation, heat or cold,
anything like that?

278
00:24:43,289 --> 00:24:45,985
You can't break it down into specifics.

279
00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:49,392
They say you see a tunnel
with a light at the end.

280
00:24:49,462 --> 00:24:54,229
No. But there is something out there.
It's comforting.

281
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,758
- Can you imagine how big this is?
- You walked on the moon, buddy!

282
00:24:57,837 --> 00:25:01,967
He could use some air.
You guys could get him some fluids.

283
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:05,500
- Thanks for saving my life.
- It was so much fun.

284
00:25:05,578 --> 00:25:07,512
Let's get that blood pressure going.

285
00:25:09,115 --> 00:25:11,777
Are you all right, wise one?

286
00:25:11,851 --> 00:25:14,513
I feel like a highly-tuned instrument.

287
00:25:15,655 --> 00:25:18,488
Can you hear the traffic
on the Lakeshore?

288
00:25:21,327 --> 00:25:24,763
Underneath that there's a hum.

289
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,000
It's the street lights.

290
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,036
All right.

291
00:25:30,103 --> 00:25:35,166
Even fainter,
I can hear a dragging sound.

292
00:25:37,277 --> 00:25:39,211
It's getting louder.

293
00:25:42,982 --> 00:25:46,611
I not only hear it,
I can feel it.

294
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:52,821
Well, your prognosis is excellent.
You'll look great on 60 Minutes.

295
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:55,527
It's bigger than that.

296
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:57,688
By the time you're through with it,
I'm sure it will be.

297
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,534
You're not buying any of this,
are you?

298
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:05,628
You forgot.
I'm an atheist.

299
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,768
- You all right for a few minutes?
- Yeah.

300
00:26:17,917 --> 00:26:20,977
- How's he doing?
- Physically he's stable.

301
00:26:21,054 --> 00:26:23,852
He's talking like Lazarus
back from the dead.

302
00:26:23,923 --> 00:26:26,949
That's what we did.
We brought him back from the dead.

303
00:26:27,026 --> 00:26:29,824
- What we did was get lucky.
- I would like to go next.

304
00:26:29,896 --> 00:26:32,421
- Forget it.
- Me, too. Seriously.

305
00:26:32,499 --> 00:26:36,094
- Why shouldn't we all get famous?
- That's not what this is about.

306
00:26:36,169 --> 00:26:39,104
You'll be famous.
They'll build monuments to you.

307
00:26:39,172 --> 00:26:41,606
Little stones about this high.
"Rest in peace."

308
00:26:41,674 --> 00:26:43,608
Like it or not,
I'm going next.

309
00:26:43,676 --> 00:26:46,110
I'm willing to go
1 minute 20 seconds.

310
00:26:49,782 --> 00:26:53,013
- 1:30.
- Are you two crazy?

311
00:26:53,086 --> 00:26:57,750
Or are you so tragically competitive
that you'd bid with your lives?

312
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,258
1:30.

313
00:27:02,462 --> 00:27:03,952
That's it.

314
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:07,397
Not a bad price to pay
for fame and glory.

315
00:27:07,467 --> 00:27:11,597
Die to be a hero if you want,
but don't die to be a celebrity.

316
00:28:07,794 --> 00:28:09,318
Champ?

317
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:24,332
- Someone should stay with him tonight.
- I have class in three hours.

318
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,843
I will.

319
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,345
You okay?

320
00:28:29,515 --> 00:28:32,609
I'd like to go home.

321
00:29:10,056 --> 00:29:12,024
Are you okay?

322
00:29:13,459 --> 00:29:15,620
You were hyperventilating.

323
00:29:18,498 --> 00:29:21,365
Your blood pressure will rise
in the next 14 hours.

324
00:29:21,434 --> 00:29:24,426
Cardiovascular vessels will constrict,
increasing your blood supply.

325
00:29:28,207 --> 00:29:30,232
God, you're beautiful.

326
00:29:31,611 --> 00:29:33,579
Get some rest.

327
00:29:37,483 --> 00:29:41,419
I bet 24 hours ago you didn't think
you'd be spending the night here.

328
00:29:42,488 --> 00:29:45,787
You were lucky last night, Nelson.
Don't push it.

329
00:29:59,806 --> 00:30:03,708
I want to wish you two
the best of everything together.

330
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:08,304
I know you'll be healthy,
wealthy and happy in your wealth.

331
00:30:13,486 --> 00:30:16,546
Hello.
May I speak to Anne Coldren?

332
00:30:19,592 --> 00:30:21,822
- Hello.
- Anne?

333
00:30:21,894 --> 00:30:26,957
Hi. I have been thinking about you
all day. How are you?

334
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:29,934
- Counting the days to Thanksgiving.
- Me, too.

335
00:30:30,002 --> 00:30:35,565
I've got to transfer to a school
closer to you or get a faster car.

336
00:30:35,641 --> 00:30:38,610
Maybe we should have gotten married
last summer.

337
00:30:38,678 --> 00:30:40,703
My mother wasn't ready yet.

338
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,839
Honey, you're the best.

339
00:30:45,985 --> 00:30:47,976
If anything
should ever happen--

340
00:30:48,921 --> 00:30:52,982
- Joe, what's wrong?
- I don 't know. I'm tired.

341
00:30:53,826 --> 00:30:55,760
I'm not making sense.

342
00:30:55,828 --> 00:30:57,625
I should go.

343
00:30:57,697 --> 00:31:00,530
- What's the matter? You're scaring me.
- It's okay, honey.

344
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,693
Nothing's wrong.

345
00:31:02,769 --> 00:31:04,703
I love you.

346
00:31:04,771 --> 00:31:06,204
Bye.

347
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,073
Ah, there.

348
00:31:43,342 --> 00:31:45,401
It's a boy.

349
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:33,257
Nothing.

350
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:36,489
Starting CPR.
1-1,000. 2-1,000.

351
00:32:36,562 --> 00:32:38,496
3-1,000. 4-1,000.

352
00:32:38,564 --> 00:32:40,691
5-1,000. Breathe!

353
00:32:40,766 --> 00:32:42,700
- CPR, adrenaline and nothing!
- 1:45.

354
00:32:42,768 --> 00:32:45,396
What's going on?
Come on, Joe!

355
00:32:45,471 --> 00:32:48,031
- 3-1,000.
- Let me try.

356
00:32:48,107 --> 00:32:50,371
- Breathe!
- We're running out of time.

357
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:55,113
- Let me try!
- I'm doing everything I can. Breathe!

358
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:58,048
- Let him try.
- Nelson, step back.

359
00:33:00,086 --> 00:33:03,886
1-1,000. 2-1,000. 3-1,000. 4-1,000.

360
00:33:03,956 --> 00:33:06,049
5-1,000. Breathe.

361
00:33:46,532 --> 00:33:48,966
Got him! 02.

362
00:33:52,838 --> 00:33:54,135
02 up.

363
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:02,347
CPR successful.
Hurley lives.

364
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,110
It's okay, Joe.

365
00:34:12,325 --> 00:34:14,486
- It was great.
- Here it comes.

366
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,326
- Just let him talk.
- Define "great."

367
00:34:18,397 --> 00:34:20,228
I don't know.

368
00:34:20,299 --> 00:34:23,996
It's not thinking about the past
or the future.

369
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:27,267
It's difficult to explain.
Maybe impossible.

370
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,968
Dying is funny that way.

371
00:34:30,042 --> 00:34:34,240
Nelson's right. There definitely
is activity beyond death.

372
00:34:34,313 --> 00:34:35,803
Absolutely.

373
00:34:35,881 --> 00:34:38,645
The experience was strange.

374
00:34:38,718 --> 00:34:41,653
It was almost erotic.

375
00:34:41,721 --> 00:34:43,655
He's dead and he gets laid.

376
00:34:43,723 --> 00:34:47,056
Wait a second.
What do you mean, "erotic"?

377
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:51,290
I don't want you to think it was
casually, wantonly sexual by any means.

378
00:34:51,364 --> 00:34:53,924
That never would have occurred to me
in a million years.

379
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:57,527
It was friendly.

380
00:34:57,603 --> 00:35:00,697
There was something vaguely feminine
guiding me.

381
00:35:00,773 --> 00:35:03,742
This could be the conquest
of our generation.

382
00:35:03,809 --> 00:35:06,277
The last great frontier.
First you had...

383
00:35:06,345 --> 00:35:08,745
the sea, then America.

384
00:35:08,814 --> 00:35:10,941
Then the West, the moon.

385
00:35:11,017 --> 00:35:13,542
Mr.Leary, drugs,
the inner journey.

386
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:17,214
Miss MacLaine, and our former
First Lady, the outer journey.

387
00:35:17,289 --> 00:35:19,917
- But this is ours.
- We did have disco.

388
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:24,395
We have found something worthwhile
to upstage those fucking baby boomers.

389
00:35:24,463 --> 00:35:26,363
Watch your mouths.

390
00:35:26,432 --> 00:35:30,198
I found something.
Let's not forget that.

391
00:35:30,269 --> 00:35:32,464
I came back from the dead tonight.

392
00:35:32,538 --> 00:35:36,030
Doesn't surprise me.
We had Elvis in here last night.

393
00:35:39,111 --> 00:35:41,602
Pay when you're ready, okay?

394
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:47,410
Did you find it difficult at the end,
getting back?

395
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,254
Not that I remember.

396
00:35:50,322 --> 00:35:54,952
But you remember everything else?
You guys are full of shit.

397
00:35:56,495 --> 00:35:59,430
I'm not buying any of this.

398
00:35:59,498 --> 00:36:04,333
I probably wouldn't buy it either
unless I'd been there.

399
00:36:05,404 --> 00:36:08,339
- What about it?
- You're an atheist.

400
00:36:08,407 --> 00:36:10,807
You've got nothing to lose.

401
00:36:10,876 --> 00:36:12,776
I'm going next.

402
00:36:12,845 --> 00:36:15,109
Wait a minute.
Nobody...

403
00:36:15,181 --> 00:36:17,649
is going next.

404
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:22,814
There's no answers here.
You saw what you wanted to see.

405
00:36:22,888 --> 00:36:25,982
- Give it up. It's getting too dangerous.
- Who the hell are you--

406
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:30,188
We can't turn back now.
I'm going further. 1:50.

407
00:36:32,832 --> 00:36:34,265
Two minutes.

408
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:37,791
- Whoa, you just said--
- I changed my mind. Two minutes.

409
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:40,862
- 2:10.
- 2:20.

410
00:36:43,442 --> 00:36:46,104
Well, looks like
we found a winner.

411
00:36:52,785 --> 00:36:54,946
Enjoying yourself, Nelson?

412
00:37:06,198 --> 00:37:07,631
Joe...

413
00:37:10,302 --> 00:37:12,702
was there anything negative
about your experience?

414
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:15,104
Anything negative at all?

415
00:37:15,174 --> 00:37:17,870
No. Nothing.

416
00:37:22,515 --> 00:37:24,676
Good.

417
00:37:27,153 --> 00:37:28,745
Hold on.

418
00:37:28,821 --> 00:37:32,120
- Was that your idea of chivalry?
- Absolutely not.

419
00:37:32,191 --> 00:37:34,318
Maybe trying to show me up.

420
00:37:34,393 --> 00:37:37,328
What makes you think everything
is always about you?

421
00:37:37,396 --> 00:37:42,459
Because nobody seems to want me to
go under. I don't need your protection.

422
00:37:42,535 --> 00:37:45,902
There seems to be a lot of speculation
about what you do need, Manus.

423
00:37:45,971 --> 00:37:49,839
Does there? And what did you decide
in your infinite wisdom?

424
00:37:49,909 --> 00:37:54,903
I decided that when someone
as smart and driven as you are...

425
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,914
and incredibly beautiful...

426
00:37:56,982 --> 00:38:00,713
it makes the rest of us
very nervous.

427
00:38:01,987 --> 00:38:03,921
Why'd you change your mind?

428
00:38:03,989 --> 00:38:08,483
I'm the skeptic, the control
on this experiment. I should go next.

429
00:38:08,561 --> 00:38:11,553
If there's nothing there,
I won't convince myself there is.

430
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:15,066
Then there's no reason for us
to go any further.

431
00:38:15,134 --> 00:38:19,161
How do you explain the similarity
of death experiences all over the world?

432
00:38:19,238 --> 00:38:21,570
People from different cultures
and religions...

433
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,165
all seeing the same things
in the same order.

434
00:38:24,243 --> 00:38:27,940
I don't know. Maybe there's a chemical
or hormone released from the brain...

435
00:38:28,013 --> 00:38:30,948
at the time of death
that makes it more palatable to us.

436
00:38:31,016 --> 00:38:33,007
No, you're reaching.

437
00:38:34,086 --> 00:38:36,919
What if you go
and there is something out there?

438
00:38:36,989 --> 00:38:41,255
Well, then you can kill yourself
for as long as you want.

439
00:38:41,327 --> 00:38:43,261
I'm not going to kill myself.

440
00:38:43,329 --> 00:38:46,264
I'm glad to hear that because
I haven't known you for long...

441
00:38:46,332 --> 00:38:49,062
but I might miss you.

442
00:38:52,037 --> 00:38:54,005
Why this obsession with death?

443
00:38:54,073 --> 00:38:56,633
It's not an obsession,
it's an interest.

444
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,939
It's a personal interest.

445
00:39:00,512 --> 00:39:01,945
Good night.

446
00:39:02,014 --> 00:39:04,812
Can I drive you home?

447
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:06,317
No, thanks.

448
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:14,651
I didn't take your money.
You gave it to me.

449
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,816
I got your toaster.
Too many appliances make you love me.

450
00:40:18,891 --> 00:40:20,552
Right, Nelson?

451
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:25,825
Because in the end,
we all know what we've done.

452
00:40:50,856 --> 00:40:52,289
Champ?

453
00:41:37,736 --> 00:41:40,569
Come on, boy!
Come here. Champ?

454
00:41:42,741 --> 00:41:45,676
Come here, boy.
Come on. Champ!

455
00:41:51,984 --> 00:41:55,442
What are you doing here, kid?
You all right?

456
00:41:57,523 --> 00:41:58,956
You okay?

457
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:02,087
Are you lost?

458
00:42:23,682 --> 00:42:25,673
Halloween morning.

459
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:28,584
Rotting pumpkins.
Burning leaves.

460
00:42:28,654 --> 00:42:31,122
Black cats mating like rats
in the alley.

461
00:42:32,391 --> 00:42:34,382
It was as--

462
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:37,224
It were as if we felt no fear.

463
00:42:37,296 --> 00:42:39,764
As if we were already dead...

464
00:42:39,832 --> 00:42:42,926
and had nothing to lose by dying.

465
00:42:43,001 --> 00:42:47,267
Or perhaps it was because
we lived life so well...

466
00:42:47,339 --> 00:42:49,705
and loved life so much...

467
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:52,369
that we imagined ourselves immortal...

468
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:56,505
overwhelming the powers that be with
the force of our passion for science.

469
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:01,519
Or maybe we were just fucked
in the head.

470
00:43:03,689 --> 00:43:06,988
I'm Joe Hurley.
You're Terry, right?

471
00:43:08,527 --> 00:43:11,928
I heard you had
a near-death experience.

472
00:43:11,997 --> 00:43:13,931
I don't want to talk about it.

473
00:43:16,268 --> 00:43:19,965
Wait a minute.
I had a near-death experience also.

474
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:24,442
- You did?
- Yes, and I need somebody to talk to.

475
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:27,935
This thing changed my life.

476
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:32,276
First of all,
they didn't believe me.

477
00:43:32,351 --> 00:43:34,785
What the hell do they know?
We were there, right?

478
00:43:34,853 --> 00:43:37,344
Tell me all about it.

479
00:43:37,422 --> 00:43:39,652
But if you have class...

480
00:43:39,725 --> 00:43:42,421
maybe we can get together some night
and discuss it.

481
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:46,396
All that day,
I knew something was going to happen.

482
00:43:46,465 --> 00:43:48,399
I've always had premonitions.

483
00:43:49,568 --> 00:43:52,696
Once my aunt was supposed
to fly in from Las Vegas.

484
00:44:00,612 --> 00:44:03,513
Why'd you do this to me, Joe?

485
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,461
Shit!

486
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:36,198
Trick or treat!

487
00:46:21,019 --> 00:46:24,352
I don't know. It's Halloween.
There's a full moon.

488
00:46:24,423 --> 00:46:27,119
Don't you think we're pushing it
a bit?

489
00:46:28,627 --> 00:46:31,425
- Sorry I'm late.
- What happened to your face?

490
00:46:31,496 --> 00:46:34,124
Some very big guys.
It doesn't matter.

491
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:36,827
- Let me look at it.
- I'm fine.

492
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:42,401
- Where have you been?
- I don't feel well.

493
00:46:42,474 --> 00:46:46,467
- What happened to you?
- Enough. Worry about your camera.

494
00:46:48,513 --> 00:46:49,946
Nice outfit.

495
00:46:53,051 --> 00:46:55,485
- You ready?
- I'm ready.

496
00:46:55,554 --> 00:46:58,990
Who are you supposed to be,
Boner Man?

497
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:02,785
2:20. Don't forget.

498
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:07,264
Just hurry and get back.
You can buy us breakfast.

499
00:47:07,332 --> 00:47:09,425
- Nelson?
- What?

500
00:47:09,501 --> 00:47:11,662
Don't let go of the rope.

501
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:16,306
Hoka hey.

502
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:19,567
See you soon.

503
00:47:29,788 --> 00:47:32,256
20cc's sodium pentathol in.

504
00:47:36,128 --> 00:47:39,757
- 86 degrees.
- 200 joules charged.

505
00:47:43,168 --> 00:47:44,601
Clear.

506
00:47:49,941 --> 00:47:51,374
Flatline.

507
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:44,391
What hangs in the air palpably?

508
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:47,899
Is it hope, fear,
the musky fear of death?

509
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:50,332
- Shut up.
- No, you shut up.

510
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:56,673
What if he didn't make it back?

511
00:48:59,211 --> 00:49:01,441
Would you miss him, Rachel?

512
00:49:04,449 --> 00:49:05,882
One minute.

513
00:49:23,535 --> 00:49:26,299
- 90 degrees.
- Let's give him another five seconds.

514
00:49:26,371 --> 00:49:28,931
- What?
- Why not ten?

515
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:30,941
We have time to decide.

516
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:33,876
Are you serious?

517
00:49:33,945 --> 00:49:36,778
I trusted you, Joe.

518
00:49:38,216 --> 00:49:40,446
Stations.
You're blocking our view.

519
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:43,784
- No kidding around. 2:10.
- Who's kidding?

520
00:49:46,391 --> 00:49:49,121
- What's going on?
- 92 degrees.

521
00:49:51,663 --> 00:49:53,426
Get it!

522
00:49:54,499 --> 00:49:57,957
Come on.
2:15. 2:16. 2:17.

523
00:49:58,036 --> 00:49:59,469
2:18.

524
00:50:00,839 --> 00:50:04,240
2:20. Hand it over.

525
00:50:04,309 --> 00:50:07,767
This is my lab.
300 joules.

526
00:50:10,282 --> 00:50:11,749
Charged.

527
00:50:11,816 --> 00:50:13,443
Clear.

528
00:50:16,488 --> 00:50:19,116
Three, six, nine
The goose drank wine

529
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:21,681
The monkey chewed tobacco
on the streetcar line

530
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,990
The line broke
The monkey got choked

531
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:26,622
They all went to heaven
in a little rowboat

532
00:50:26,698 --> 00:50:28,825
- Breathe.
- Sodium bicarb and Eppy in.

533
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:32,529
1-1,000. 2-1,000.
What comes next?

534
00:50:33,605 --> 00:50:37,598
- Knock it off!
- 5-1,000. Breathe.

535
00:50:38,376 --> 00:50:40,674
300 joules charged.

536
00:50:40,745 --> 00:50:44,112
Clear.
Come on, Dave.

537
00:50:55,827 --> 00:50:57,260
That's it!

538
00:50:57,329 --> 00:50:59,354
That's not it. He's stuck in V-fib.
Charging again. 300.

539
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:01,194
- You're hot.
- Try lidocaine.

540
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:03,826
- At 2:45, atropine.
- Not yet. Clear.

541
00:51:04,736 --> 00:51:06,328
Come on, Dave.

542
00:51:06,404 --> 00:51:09,840
Increasing defibs to 360.
Charge. Clear.

543
00:51:09,908 --> 00:51:12,638
- Go to lidocaine!
- He won't hold the heat.

544
00:51:12,711 --> 00:51:14,144
Three minutes.

545
00:51:14,212 --> 00:51:16,339
Starting CPR. 1-1,000.

546
00:51:16,414 --> 00:51:20,145
- Atropine in.
- Keep filming. I'll bring him back.

547
00:51:20,218 --> 00:51:23,085
- 5-1,000. Breathe.
- You lied to me, Joe.

548
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,056
Lost him.

549
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:29,025
- Lidocaine push.
- Somebody do something.

550
00:51:29,094 --> 00:51:31,392
360 charged. Clear.

551
00:51:35,333 --> 00:51:37,563
- Got him!
- 02 standing by.

552
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:40,662
- One milligram Eppy in.
- That sounds good.

553
00:51:40,739 --> 00:51:44,903
That was close.
That was way too close.

554
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:47,672
Okay? That was too close.

555
00:51:47,746 --> 00:51:50,408
Hoka hey.

556
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:53,144
- What did you say there?
- Hoka hey.

557
00:51:53,218 --> 00:51:57,587
It's a war cry from the Sioux Indians.
Very macho. It means, today--

558
00:51:57,656 --> 00:52:00,022
Today is a good day to die.

559
00:52:00,091 --> 00:52:03,219
So was it, Dave?
Was today a good day to die?

560
00:52:03,294 --> 00:52:06,195
I don't know if I was dead.
I may have felt something.

561
00:52:06,264 --> 00:52:09,529
Like a dream...

562
00:52:09,601 --> 00:52:12,468
or just a bunch of stuff
stored up inside my mind.

563
00:52:12,537 --> 00:52:15,597
You were brain dead.
There was no mind.

564
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:19,633
But some electrical current's
still circulating through my body.

565
00:52:20,745 --> 00:52:23,714
It would have shown up on the EEG.
You were dead.

566
00:52:23,782 --> 00:52:26,114
Tell us what happened.

567
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:31,220
It's hard to verbalize.

568
00:52:32,657 --> 00:52:35,490
It's like being paranoid
without the fear.

569
00:52:36,628 --> 00:52:38,562
Like being watched.

570
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:41,064
It was probably just you guys
standing over me.

571
00:52:41,132 --> 00:52:43,396
Who could be watching?

572
00:52:43,468 --> 00:52:45,902
- The dead.
- I didn't say that.

573
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:50,066
But the skeptic did feel something,
didn't you? I'm going again.

574
00:52:50,141 --> 00:52:52,336
No way!
I've been bumped twice!

575
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:56,574
Bidding starts at four minutes.
Labraccio went for 3:50.

576
00:52:56,648 --> 00:52:59,139
That was a mistake.
We almost lost him.

577
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:01,651
Anything under four minutes.
would be redundant.

578
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,154
No one is going for four minutes.

579
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:05,746
4:25.

580
00:53:07,158 --> 00:53:10,150
- Five minutes.
- I'm next or I'm out for good.

581
00:53:11,029 --> 00:53:13,793
Without her help,
five minutes will be hard enough.

582
00:53:13,865 --> 00:53:16,129
- But without me--
- Or me--

583
00:53:16,201 --> 00:53:18,294
Count me out, too.

584
00:53:23,641 --> 00:53:26,508
Well, mutiny at last.

585
00:53:29,647 --> 00:53:32,115
I trusted you,
all of you...

586
00:53:32,183 --> 00:53:36,119
with an idea so simple and brilliant,
you get one in a lifetime.

587
00:53:36,187 --> 00:53:38,678
- Give it a rest.
- You give it a rest!

588
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:42,352
None of you had the foresight or balls
to do any of this until I did it.

589
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:45,362
You want to go next?
Be my guest.

590
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:47,660
Fuck the rest of you!

591
00:53:47,732 --> 00:53:51,691
This is my idea.
You're just tourists.

592
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:58,041
I would've gone 3:30, maybe 3:40.

593
00:53:58,109 --> 00:54:02,478
I still might.
But, Joe, 4:25 is crazy.

594
00:54:02,547 --> 00:54:05,880
We're pushing the five minute mark.
Dangerous! Zucchini land!

595
00:54:08,953 --> 00:54:10,978
You're a shit, Joe.

596
00:54:11,956 --> 00:54:14,424
You said you loved me, Joe.

597
00:54:18,963 --> 00:54:20,931
I love you, Joe.

598
00:54:23,201 --> 00:54:26,830
Skelator?
Are you listening to me?

599
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:38,437
Thanks for staying.

600
00:55:39,444 --> 00:55:41,844
I'm on early shift at the hospital.

601
00:55:41,913 --> 00:55:44,507
You seem fine,
so I'll see you later.

602
00:55:44,582 --> 00:55:46,015
Wait.

603
00:55:46,084 --> 00:55:49,576
- About tonight.
- Don't try to talk me out of it.

604
00:55:49,654 --> 00:55:52,088
Why are you doing this?

605
00:55:52,156 --> 00:55:57,594
Look, I've lost people
that are close to me.

606
00:55:57,662 --> 00:56:02,998
I want to make sure they've gone
to a good place. It does seem trivial.

607
00:56:03,067 --> 00:56:05,934
To tell you the truth, it's the best
reason I've heard yet for going.

608
00:56:08,006 --> 00:56:11,840
There's something I didn't tell you
about last night.

609
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:18,015
I had this feeling that if I had gone
any further...

610
00:56:18,082 --> 00:56:22,314
that there was something out there
protecting me.

611
00:56:23,187 --> 00:56:26,122
You know, something good.

612
00:56:27,358 --> 00:56:29,292
So you don't need to go under.

613
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:32,625
Does the atheist now believe in God?

614
00:56:32,697 --> 00:56:34,961
I'm trying to tell you...

615
00:56:35,033 --> 00:56:38,093
that I don't want you to do it.

616
00:56:40,872 --> 00:56:43,966
Just think about all I'll have
to talk about...

617
00:56:44,042 --> 00:56:46,306
when you bring me back.

618
00:56:48,913 --> 00:56:50,346
I'm dying.

619
00:56:51,549 --> 00:56:53,949
Don't lie to me.

620
00:56:57,388 --> 00:57:00,016
You've put up a great fight.

621
00:57:00,858 --> 00:57:03,554
Sometimes we just have to let go.

622
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:05,562
That's what the voices say.

623
00:57:06,931 --> 00:57:08,694
What voices?

624
00:57:08,766 --> 00:57:11,098
They say, "Have you done enough?

625
00:57:12,203 --> 00:57:15,263
Have you told everyone you loved them?"

626
00:57:15,907 --> 00:57:18,876
I have. I have.

627
00:57:18,943 --> 00:57:23,039
It's okay.
They're friendly voices.

628
00:57:23,114 --> 00:57:26,572
They're just telling you
what you need to know.

629
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:28,084
What?

630
00:57:29,454 --> 00:57:31,922
That you have someplace to go.

631
00:57:33,424 --> 00:57:35,358
Do you believe that?

632
00:57:36,694 --> 00:57:38,127
I do.

633
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:45,769
Yes, I do.

634
00:58:30,448 --> 00:58:33,315
Hey, Fellatio!

635
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:37,479
Got a match?

636
00:58:38,456 --> 00:58:40,515
Well, I do!

637
00:58:40,591 --> 00:58:42,286
Your face and my ass.

638
00:58:43,861 --> 00:58:47,797
- Your breath made of buffalo fart!
- Do I know you?

639
00:58:47,865 --> 00:58:52,632
You don't know jackshit!
Butt-wipe! Needle-dick! Cock-bite!

640
00:58:52,703 --> 00:58:56,537
Jack-off! Limp-wrist!
Corn-hole! Banana-breath!

641
00:58:56,607 --> 00:58:59,599
Shit-bird! Bird-turd! Turd-face!

642
00:58:59,677 --> 00:59:02,510
Kiss-ass! Brown-Nose! Macho wimp!

643
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:06,277
Limp-dick! Fart-face! Tire-merchant!
What's the matter?

644
00:59:06,350 --> 00:59:11,151
Gonna cry? Crybaby Davie.
Cry, cry, cry!

645
00:59:11,222 --> 00:59:14,521
Shit-face. Rat-turd.
Ass-licking son of a bitch.

646
00:59:33,811 --> 00:59:35,745
How'd it happen?

647
00:59:35,813 --> 00:59:37,781
I was playing hockey.

648
00:59:38,749 --> 00:59:41,183
- About last night.
- It's okay.

649
00:59:41,252 --> 00:59:45,154
No-show Labraccio.
This really isn't like him.

650
00:59:45,223 --> 00:59:48,283
It's his way of trying to stop me.
It won't work. I'm ready.

651
00:59:48,359 --> 00:59:51,123
I don't think it is a good idea
to do this without David.

652
00:59:51,195 --> 00:59:55,359
- We don't need Dave.
- Can you do this?

653
00:59:55,433 --> 00:59:57,867
Can you trust me?

654
00:59:57,935 --> 01:00:00,096
No, but let's do it anyway.

655
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:03,671
Nitrous on.

656
01:00:07,778 --> 01:00:09,712
See you soon.

657
01:00:26,130 --> 01:00:28,121
- How long has she been under?
- 1:20.

658
01:00:28,199 --> 01:00:31,293
We're bringing her back.
Click that blanket to warm. Body temp?

659
01:00:31,369 --> 01:00:33,837
- She hasn't been under long enough.
- Do it.

660
01:00:33,905 --> 01:00:37,306
- We said 4:25.
- Just do it!

661
01:00:37,375 --> 01:00:40,538
Don't expect hugs and kisses
for this.

662
01:01:23,821 --> 01:01:27,951
Waiting for body temp to rise.
Aborting fourth experiment. Why, Dave?

663
01:01:28,025 --> 01:01:30,220
Ask Dr.Death.

664
01:01:30,294 --> 01:01:32,558
- 90 degrees.
- What's going on?

665
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:36,066
Nothing. Bringing Rachel back early.
That's all.

666
01:01:36,133 --> 01:01:39,125
- That's all?
- Don't start now! Think about Rachel.

667
01:01:39,203 --> 01:01:42,138
Joe's right. 91 degrees.
Let's be ready.

668
01:02:19,243 --> 01:02:23,236
I told you not to go in there!
I told you not to do that!

669
01:02:30,187 --> 01:02:32,951
It's your fault!

670
01:02:38,329 --> 01:02:40,263
- Nothing!
- Take me up to 300.

671
01:02:40,331 --> 01:02:42,390
- You're hot.
- Clear.

672
01:02:42,466 --> 01:02:45,196
- Come on, Rachel.
- Not a thing. 2:05.

673
01:02:45,269 --> 01:02:48,329
- You're hot.
- Come on, Rachel.

674
01:03:07,191 --> 01:03:09,489
300 joules. Clear.

675
01:03:10,695 --> 01:03:13,630
- Got her!
- You don't have her!

676
01:03:13,698 --> 01:03:17,464
- It's okay, we'll get her.
- Step me up to 360. Clear.

677
01:03:19,136 --> 01:03:22,469
What the hell is going on?
What'd you do to me? I had her.

678
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:24,838
A fuse. Short.
Maybe a circuit.

679
01:03:24,909 --> 01:03:28,140
- Joe, you charged the battery, right?
- Shit!

680
01:03:29,246 --> 01:03:31,737
Starting CPR.
Bag her.

681
01:03:31,816 --> 01:03:33,511
1-1,000. 2-1,000.

682
01:03:33,584 --> 01:03:37,350
- 3-1,000. 4-1,000. 5-1,000. Breathe.
- No pulse.

683
01:03:38,489 --> 01:03:42,892
Begin. 1-1,000.
2-1,000. 3-1,000. 4-1,000.

684
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,393
5-1,000. Breathe.

685
01:04:04,849 --> 01:04:07,113
- This is not working. Joe, take over.
- I got her.

686
01:04:07,184 --> 01:04:10,210
She's been under four minutes.

687
01:04:13,524 --> 01:04:16,049
We're moving to Bretylium.
It's the only way.

688
01:04:16,961 --> 01:04:20,453
- It's our last chance.
- Don't. You will fry her.

689
01:04:28,639 --> 01:04:30,539
Please don't.

690
01:04:37,882 --> 01:04:40,043
You bring her back.

691
01:04:44,655 --> 01:04:46,145
Come on.

692
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:52,320
Lidocaine in.

693
01:04:52,396 --> 01:04:56,457
Come on, Manus.
Come on back to us.

694
01:05:01,338 --> 01:05:02,965
I got something.

695
01:05:04,575 --> 01:05:06,509
I hear something.

696
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:11,278
O2. O2.

697
01:05:16,086 --> 01:05:17,610
She's back.

698
01:05:30,234 --> 01:05:34,295
- Why did you stop us?
- Something strange happened on the EI.

699
01:05:34,371 --> 01:05:38,273
- That's why you stopped us?
- There was this girl. Winnie Hicks.

700
01:05:38,342 --> 01:05:42,608
I was in elementary school with her.
We used to make fun of her.

701
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:45,274
I was on the train.
I heard someone call me names.

702
01:05:45,349 --> 01:05:49,410
I turned, I swear to God,
and she was standing in front of me.

703
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:52,012
- Still only 10 years old.
- Maybe it was an hallucination.

704
01:05:52,089 --> 01:05:54,956
Maybe you fell asleep,
thoughts triggered by submerged guilt.

705
01:05:55,025 --> 01:05:57,391
I was not asleep.

706
01:05:57,461 --> 01:06:01,693
I've seen odd things from my past, too.
I thought it might be brain damage.

707
01:06:01,765 --> 01:06:04,666
In your case, it probably is.
I'm getting this on tape.

708
01:06:04,735 --> 01:06:06,965
- Shut that off. This is personal.
- Go ahead, Joe.

709
01:06:08,005 --> 01:06:12,669
I've been haunted by images of women
I videotaped without them knowing.

710
01:06:12,743 --> 01:06:16,008
They're all members
of the Joe Hurley video library.

711
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,139
What?

712
01:06:18,215 --> 01:06:22,413
What about you, Nelson?
Who's come looking for you?

713
01:06:23,854 --> 01:06:28,314
I think his name's Billy Mahoney,
an eight-year-old kid we picked on.

714
01:06:28,392 --> 01:06:30,883
- It was no big deal.
- No big deal, huh?

715
01:06:30,961 --> 01:06:33,259
Then tell us what happened
to your face.

716
01:06:33,330 --> 01:06:35,992
Sometimes the little fella
gets carried away.

717
01:06:36,066 --> 01:06:39,263
Wait a minute. Wait.
I can understand...

718
01:06:39,336 --> 01:06:43,705
Dave nodding off and pervert here
having flashbacks.

719
01:06:43,774 --> 01:06:48,143
This guy physically touches you? It is
not hallucination and is not possible.

720
01:06:48,212 --> 01:06:50,680
This whole lab's not possible.
Or is it?

721
01:06:50,748 --> 01:06:54,684
- This is too weird.
- Weird? We've experienced death.

722
01:06:54,752 --> 01:06:58,745
Somehow we brought our sins
back physically, and they're pissed.

723
01:06:58,822 --> 01:07:01,484
When did you know about this?

724
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:03,857
I had my suspicions after Joe went.

725
01:07:03,928 --> 01:07:07,591
- Before we went? You didn't say a word!
- That was wrong.

726
01:07:07,665 --> 01:07:10,225
I thought we were doctors, scientists.

727
01:07:10,301 --> 01:07:12,235
You call yourself a scientist?

728
01:07:12,303 --> 01:07:15,864
It is reckless and unethical for you
to withhold findings from us.

729
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:20,036
Rachel Manus may have the answers
to life and death.

730
01:07:20,110 --> 01:07:23,876
Five minutes. Imagine that!
She was under for five minutes!

731
01:07:23,948 --> 01:07:28,647
If she walks out of that ladies room
with those answers...

732
01:07:28,719 --> 01:07:30,653
the whole world will worship her.

733
01:07:32,122 --> 01:07:34,989
Just like you do.

734
01:07:36,327 --> 01:07:38,591
You should've told us.

735
01:07:38,662 --> 01:07:42,063
- You wouldn't have done it.
- We would've had a choice!

736
01:07:50,808 --> 01:07:52,241
We're fucked.

737
01:07:54,945 --> 01:07:56,469
You all right?

738
01:07:56,547 --> 01:07:58,777
I'm okay.

739
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:12,255
I said I was fine!

740
01:08:13,664 --> 01:08:16,224
You guys gonna watch me?

741
01:09:29,206 --> 01:09:32,141
Come on, Billy Mahoney.

742
01:09:32,209 --> 01:09:35,701
Come on.
Give me your best shot.

743
01:09:38,315 --> 01:09:40,340
I dare you.

744
01:09:41,819 --> 01:09:44,219
I fucking dare you.

745
01:09:44,288 --> 01:09:48,349
Things from our past?
They want revenge?

746
01:09:48,425 --> 01:09:51,724
I don't know.
I'm not exactly sure how it works.

747
01:09:51,795 --> 01:09:53,786
But if you see anything...

748
01:09:53,864 --> 01:09:56,128
talk to me about it.

749
01:09:56,200 --> 01:10:00,364
Whatever it is,
tell the doctor.

750
01:10:02,806 --> 01:10:04,774
I'll be in the living room
if you need me.

751
01:10:04,842 --> 01:10:06,901
Is it people who we've...

752
01:10:06,977 --> 01:10:09,571
hurt or wronged in some way?

753
01:10:09,646 --> 01:10:13,309
Did something happen tonight?
Want to talk to me about something?

754
01:10:17,988 --> 01:10:20,081
Try to get some rest.

755
01:10:26,163 --> 01:10:28,131
- How is she doing?
- I think she's hiding something.

756
01:10:28,198 --> 01:10:31,827
- Like what? Heebie-jeebie stuff?
- What did Nelson do to that kid?

757
01:10:31,902 --> 01:10:34,166
How the hell am I supposed to know?

758
01:10:34,238 --> 01:10:37,765
It's important
we keep each other informed.

759
01:10:37,841 --> 01:10:41,800
I'm sorry. You guys take off.
I'll stay with her.

760
01:10:41,879 --> 01:10:45,246
- You okay?
- I'm fine. I'm sorry.

761
01:11:22,853 --> 01:11:25,321
We're gonna get you, Billy Mahoney!

762
01:11:28,292 --> 01:11:29,486
I'm sorry!

763
01:11:32,729 --> 01:11:35,357
Stop, Nelson!

764
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:09,531
- How you doing?
- I'm late. I'll see you later.

765
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:12,034
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?

766
01:12:12,102 --> 01:12:14,400
I have to talk to her.
I've got to stop her.

767
01:12:14,471 --> 01:12:16,439
Talk to who?

768
01:12:16,506 --> 01:12:18,497
Good morning, Rachel.

769
01:12:25,082 --> 01:12:27,710
I wanted to tell her
the voices were wrong.

770
01:12:27,784 --> 01:12:30,582
There's nothing beautiful
out there.

771
01:12:30,654 --> 01:12:33,020
Losing them is part of our work.

772
01:12:33,090 --> 01:12:35,854
But I was wrong.

773
01:13:14,164 --> 01:13:15,893
Crybaby, cry!

774
01:13:41,758 --> 01:13:44,625
You look like
you're enjoying the day.

775
01:13:45,729 --> 01:13:47,458
Yeah, right.

776
01:13:47,531 --> 01:13:49,658
Don't you remember me, Joe?

777
01:13:50,734 --> 01:13:52,998
Yes, of course.

778
01:13:53,070 --> 01:13:55,061
Are you a model?

779
01:13:55,138 --> 01:13:59,234
- You could be.
- I've got to go.

780
01:13:59,309 --> 01:14:03,769
I'm not picking you up.
I just picked you out.

781
01:14:03,847 --> 01:14:07,214
- Mind if I buy you a drink?
- No, thanks.

782
01:14:07,284 --> 01:14:11,948
- I'll call about being my study partner.
- Fine. I'm in the book.

783
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:18,819
Hey, gorgeous.

784
01:14:18,895 --> 01:14:21,659
- How are you?
- What are you doing?

785
01:14:21,732 --> 01:14:25,828
Some crazy girl--
I know you, don't I?

786
01:14:27,104 --> 01:14:30,540
Would you like to?
We don't have to do anything.

787
01:14:30,607 --> 01:14:35,044
We can just lie together.
Hold each other in our underwear.

788
01:14:41,718 --> 01:14:44,653
I'll call you.
I promise.

789
01:14:45,822 --> 01:14:49,383
I'm tired of playing the field.

790
01:14:49,459 --> 01:14:52,826
We can stop whenever you want.

791
01:14:54,131 --> 01:14:57,259
It'll only make
our relationship better.

792
01:14:59,436 --> 01:15:01,904
I've never felt like this before.

793
01:15:01,972 --> 01:15:05,135
I'm tired of playing the field.

794
01:15:05,208 --> 01:15:09,076
- Of course I respect you.
- You can stop whenever you want.

795
01:15:18,088 --> 01:15:21,023
I need you to show me
that you love me.

796
01:15:21,091 --> 01:15:23,082
You're not real!

797
01:15:29,466 --> 01:15:32,492
Anne, is that you?

798
01:15:34,971 --> 01:15:36,905
Is that really you?

799
01:15:36,973 --> 01:15:40,272
You sounded so upset on the phone.

800
01:15:40,343 --> 01:15:44,109
I was worried.
I took the bus down.

801
01:15:44,181 --> 01:15:47,150
What a great surprise!

802
01:15:47,217 --> 01:15:49,708
How long have you been here?

803
01:15:49,786 --> 01:15:52,414
Long enough to see your tapes.

804
01:15:53,924 --> 01:15:55,585
Oh, my God!

805
01:15:57,060 --> 01:15:58,493
You know...

806
01:15:59,596 --> 01:16:03,362
you'll think I'm leaving you
because you slept with those girls.

807
01:16:03,433 --> 01:16:06,561
It was a stupid game.
They meant nothing to me.

808
01:16:06,636 --> 01:16:09,662
I wish they had meant something,
because if you were honest...

809
01:16:09,739 --> 01:16:13,038
if you had cared for any of them,
I could have fought that.

810
01:16:13,110 --> 01:16:17,137
I loved you. But to film all those girls
without them knowing it.

811
01:16:17,214 --> 01:16:20,706
To have so little respect.
Those women trusted you.

812
01:16:20,784 --> 01:16:24,777
What kind of marriage can we have
when you have no understanding of trust?

813
01:16:24,855 --> 01:16:26,584
Please!

814
01:16:27,891 --> 01:16:31,122
- It's not what you think.
- Yes, it is.

815
01:16:34,264 --> 01:16:37,358
Hello. Is this Mrs. Earl R. Hicks?

816
01:16:37,434 --> 01:16:42,497
This is a strange question.
Do you have a daughter Winnie, about 26?

817
01:16:42,572 --> 01:16:45,598
You do? Great!
My name is David Labraccio.

818
01:16:45,675 --> 01:16:49,736
I was in school with Winnie.
We went to S.B. Butler together.

819
01:16:49,813 --> 01:16:53,249
My parents still live there.
Fine.

820
01:16:53,316 --> 01:16:56,513
I wanted to get in touch with her.
I was wondering--

821
01:16:57,721 --> 01:16:59,211
Right.

822
01:17:00,423 --> 01:17:03,358
Okay. And do you have
an address for her?

823
01:17:05,262 --> 01:17:08,561
Great. Thank you, Mrs.Hicks.
I appreciate it. Bye.

824
01:17:16,940 --> 01:17:18,840
Jesus!

825
01:17:18,909 --> 01:17:21,139
Looks as bad as it feels, huh?

826
01:17:21,211 --> 01:17:23,736
Want me to take a look?

827
01:17:23,813 --> 01:17:26,441
I just want to know
how Rachel was doing.

828
01:17:26,516 --> 01:17:29,314
She didn't come out of the bathroom
with the answers to life and death.

829
01:17:29,386 --> 01:17:31,377
I gotta go.

830
01:17:32,255 --> 01:17:34,883
- Where are you going?
- Bensenville.

831
01:17:34,958 --> 01:17:37,722
- Could I go?
- It's a two-hour drive.

832
01:17:37,794 --> 01:17:39,489
Look...

833
01:17:41,498 --> 01:17:44,558
I don't want to be alone.

834
01:17:44,634 --> 01:17:48,502
Today we are going to remove
the left kidney...

835
01:17:48,572 --> 01:17:51,871
and dissect the lower intestines.

836
01:17:51,942 --> 01:17:56,709
Remove the ascending colon
from the transverse colon.

837
01:17:58,014 --> 01:18:01,677
Proceed to the sigmoid colon
and on to the appendix.

838
01:18:03,053 --> 01:18:06,352
Remove the appendix,
taking note of the blood supply.

839
01:18:06,423 --> 01:18:09,051
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

840
01:18:09,125 --> 01:18:10,752
You okay?

841
01:18:10,827 --> 01:18:14,593
I would be if everyone would
stop asking me if I'm all right.

842
01:18:20,437 --> 01:18:23,235
Are you crazy?
Is she getting the heebie-jeebies?

843
01:18:23,306 --> 01:18:24,705
I'm spooking.

844
01:18:24,774 --> 01:18:29,040
Getting us kicked out of med school
won't get Anne back. Get to work.

845
01:19:23,466 --> 01:19:27,960
I'll handle this.
Back to work or suffer the consequences.

846
01:19:29,239 --> 01:19:31,366
Fuck it.

847
01:19:40,050 --> 01:19:43,986
- This must be it.
- Looks like Winnie did well for herself.

848
01:19:44,054 --> 01:19:47,649
She's probably not going to remember
who you are.

849
01:19:47,724 --> 01:19:51,057
It's worth a shot.
You coming?

850
01:19:53,129 --> 01:19:56,326
Listen, if anything happens...

851
01:19:56,399 --> 01:19:59,630
if you need me,
just honk the horn.

852
01:20:26,896 --> 01:20:29,558
Ring, ring, ring.

853
01:20:29,632 --> 01:20:32,726
- Dave, you should've sent a letter.
- Hello!

854
01:20:32,802 --> 01:20:34,531
Anybody home?

855
01:20:42,946 --> 01:20:44,937
Is your mother at home?

856
01:20:45,014 --> 01:20:46,777
Coming.

857
01:20:49,319 --> 01:20:51,651
Go in the house, baby.

858
01:20:53,256 --> 01:20:55,952
Yes? Can I help you?

859
01:20:56,025 --> 01:21:01,224
Yeah. I think you can.
You're Winnie Hicks, aren't you?

860
01:21:01,297 --> 01:21:04,391
- From Clairemont?
- Yes.

861
01:21:04,467 --> 01:21:07,027
I'm David Labraccio.

862
01:21:07,103 --> 01:21:10,630
- We went to S.B. Butler together.
- Really?

863
01:21:10,707 --> 01:21:13,039
I was a little smaller then.

864
01:21:16,246 --> 01:21:19,579
I drove from the city.
That's my truck.

865
01:21:22,118 --> 01:21:23,881
Hello. I'm nice.

866
01:21:23,953 --> 01:21:28,117
He's nice.
We're both fucking lunatics.

867
01:21:28,191 --> 01:21:30,159
Can I come in, please?

868
01:21:30,226 --> 01:21:32,057
Thanks a lot.

869
01:21:33,329 --> 01:21:35,559
I've got to hand it to you.

870
01:21:36,733 --> 01:21:38,667
You've got guts.

871
01:22:18,675 --> 01:22:20,802
This is great!
It's beautiful.

872
01:22:20,877 --> 01:22:23,505
Looks like you've done well
for yourself.

873
01:22:23,580 --> 01:22:26,708
It isn't medical school.

874
01:22:27,951 --> 01:22:30,385
But I never liked school, anyway.

875
01:22:31,688 --> 01:22:34,316
Wasn't very good at it.

876
01:22:35,391 --> 01:22:37,416
I'm surprised you remember me.

877
01:22:37,494 --> 01:22:40,088
I do remember you.

878
01:22:40,163 --> 01:22:44,122
I also remember the way
we treated you back then.

879
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:47,727
You were shy, and I was a real jerk,
and I'm sorry.

880
01:22:47,804 --> 01:22:51,069
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

881
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:53,973
What are you talking about?

882
01:22:54,043 --> 01:22:58,605
That was so long ago.
I don't remember what you could've done.

883
01:22:58,681 --> 01:23:01,980
Let's not dredge up all that stuff.
Sherry, go in the house.

884
01:23:02,051 --> 01:23:05,817
However we made you feel,
it was wrong.

885
01:23:07,090 --> 01:23:09,183
I mean, we were wrong.

886
01:23:11,461 --> 01:23:12,951
Go on.

887
01:23:18,668 --> 01:23:21,136
I have a family now.

888
01:23:22,872 --> 01:23:26,364
I haven't been that ugly little girl
in quite some time.

889
01:23:26,442 --> 01:23:28,740
You were never ugly.

890
01:23:32,115 --> 01:23:34,379
Why did you come here?

891
01:24:11,454 --> 01:24:14,252
David, help!

892
01:24:14,324 --> 01:24:17,691
It was just kids.
I know how kids are.

893
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:20,251
It didn't mean anything.

894
01:24:20,330 --> 01:24:23,299
Listen, I didn't mean to come here--

895
01:24:24,534 --> 01:24:27,503
Winnie, are you all right?

896
01:24:27,570 --> 01:24:29,936
I'm fine, Ben.
Everything's okay.

897
01:24:38,781 --> 01:24:42,046
I'm sorry if I made you feel bad.

898
01:24:42,118 --> 01:24:44,586
I didn't want to hurt you again.

899
01:24:47,256 --> 01:24:49,349
I'm going to go.

900
01:24:58,034 --> 01:24:59,467
Thank you.

901
01:25:00,603 --> 01:25:02,594
Are you sure?

902
01:25:05,842 --> 01:25:07,434
Thanks.

903
01:25:16,686 --> 01:25:18,119
Shit!

904
01:25:22,358 --> 01:25:24,349
Help!

905
01:26:01,164 --> 01:26:02,825
Help!

906
01:26:18,014 --> 01:26:20,778
Nelson, stop it!

907
01:26:20,850 --> 01:26:22,875
Nelson, stop, stop!

908
01:26:24,654 --> 01:26:28,055
- Stop it!
- Where's Billy Mahoney? Where is he?

909
01:26:28,124 --> 01:26:31,457
There is no Billy.
It's just the two of us.

910
01:26:31,527 --> 01:26:35,554
We're all alone.
Let it go.

911
01:27:05,194 --> 01:27:07,788
Where the hell have you guys been?

912
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:14,495
- She freaked. We stayed with her.
- How you doing?

913
01:27:14,570 --> 01:27:16,231
I'm fine.

914
01:27:17,807 --> 01:27:22,676
Fine for somebody who keeps running into
her father who's been dead for 20 years.

915
01:27:23,980 --> 01:27:26,244
Death is beautiful?

916
01:27:26,315 --> 01:27:28,408
What a bunch of crap.

917
01:27:32,054 --> 01:27:35,319
How you doing, Nelson?
You okay?

918
01:27:37,493 --> 01:27:40,826
'Cause I'd like to thank you
for the nightmare.

919
01:27:40,897 --> 01:27:45,231
Hey, you guys were all so eager
to jump on my coattails.

920
01:27:45,301 --> 01:27:47,326
Well, welcome aboard.

921
01:27:47,403 --> 01:27:49,803
You withheld information.
That's lying.

922
01:27:49,872 --> 01:27:52,670
Oh. I'm sorry you're so upset.

923
01:27:52,742 --> 01:27:55,404
You think you're the only one
who risked something?

924
01:27:55,478 --> 01:27:58,470
I always felt there was something
unnatural about this.

925
01:27:58,548 --> 01:28:02,279
- You didn't risk a goddamn thing!
- Screw yourself!

926
01:28:02,351 --> 01:28:05,479
This is not going to help.
We're in this together.

927
01:28:05,555 --> 01:28:07,216
No, we're not.

928
01:28:07,290 --> 01:28:09,952
- Wait.
- Isn't she strong? So independent.

929
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:14,625
When I get into trouble,
I don't drag everybody down with me.

930
01:28:14,697 --> 01:28:17,063
Drag everybody? Come on!

931
01:28:17,133 --> 01:28:20,534
What happened to you? You got caught
with your videotapes down?

932
01:28:20,603 --> 01:28:24,539
And you swore at a little girl
on a playground. Oh!

933
01:28:24,607 --> 01:28:28,373
And now you're having bad dreams
about your daddy. I'm really sorry.

934
01:28:28,444 --> 01:28:32,141
You don't know anything about me.
You never have.

935
01:28:32,215 --> 01:28:35,378
But Dave does, doesn't he?

936
01:28:36,485 --> 01:28:40,216
Come on, they're your sins!
Live with them.

937
01:28:40,289 --> 01:28:42,257
I do.

938
01:28:42,325 --> 01:28:45,226
Do you want to see death?
Take a good look.

939
01:28:45,294 --> 01:28:47,228
It is beautiful.

940
01:28:47,296 --> 01:28:49,890
You've already hurt yourself.
You want to hurt her, too?

941
01:28:49,966 --> 01:28:52,093
Do you?

942
01:28:55,738 --> 01:28:57,899
Help him find Billy Mahoney.

943
01:28:57,974 --> 01:29:02,070
- How will that help?
- Goddamn it! Just help him find Billy.

944
01:29:02,144 --> 01:29:04,237
Don't leave him alone.

945
01:29:04,313 --> 01:29:08,215
Why do we want to find Billy Mahoney?

946
01:29:08,284 --> 01:29:09,717
Because...

947
01:29:10,786 --> 01:29:14,950
young Dr.Dave thinks he's solved
our karmic problems.

948
01:29:16,959 --> 01:29:19,587
Atonement, gentlemen.

949
01:29:19,662 --> 01:29:21,186
Atonement?

950
01:29:21,264 --> 01:29:23,994
Wait a goddamn minute.

951
01:29:24,066 --> 01:29:27,229
Jesus, you're always
running away from me.

952
01:29:27,303 --> 01:29:29,533
Why don't you talk to me?

953
01:29:34,377 --> 01:29:37,312
My father shot himself
when I was five.

954
01:29:37,380 --> 01:29:39,541
And you feel responsible?

955
01:29:40,883 --> 01:29:46,185
There was a door in our hallway
I wasn't supposed to go in.

956
01:29:46,255 --> 01:29:49,190
Kids always feel responsible.

957
01:29:49,258 --> 01:29:51,453
You could not have been the blame.

958
01:29:51,527 --> 01:29:55,156
You said it yourself.
People we wronged want revenge.

959
01:29:57,667 --> 01:30:02,070
I don't know if this will help,
but going to see Winnie Hicks today--

960
01:30:03,306 --> 01:30:07,367
I don't know how to explain it,
but it lifted--

961
01:30:08,844 --> 01:30:12,211
Somehow just asking for forgiveness--

962
01:30:12,281 --> 01:30:16,012
Winnie Hicks is alive.
My father's dead.

963
01:30:18,020 --> 01:30:20,648
Your father is in a good place.

964
01:30:20,723 --> 01:30:24,181
He wants you to let him go.

965
01:30:25,828 --> 01:30:27,853
Then why is he back?

966
01:30:43,512 --> 01:30:46,379
- Here.
- Where the hell are we?

967
01:30:46,449 --> 01:30:49,782
We should get your face looked at
at a hospital.

968
01:30:56,792 --> 01:30:59,022
Come on.
This is a shortcut.

969
01:30:59,095 --> 01:31:01,655
I can't believe
I remember all of this.

970
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,128
Holy shit!
The neighborhood's falling apart.

971
01:31:07,203 --> 01:31:09,967
Nelson, give me the keys.

972
01:31:11,407 --> 01:31:15,104
Step on a crack
Break your mother's back

973
01:31:19,448 --> 01:31:21,916
Olly, olly, oxen free!

974
01:31:23,085 --> 01:31:26,213
Last one over is a rotten egg.

975
01:31:26,288 --> 01:31:29,689
Come on, boys,
salvation just ahead.

976
01:31:45,441 --> 01:31:48,001
This is a graveyard.

977
01:31:52,214 --> 01:31:56,878
- Where the fuck are you, Nelson?
- This isn't funny anymore.

978
01:31:56,952 --> 01:31:59,512
It never was.

979
01:31:59,588 --> 01:32:02,455
- Where the hell are you?
- Right here.

980
01:32:08,164 --> 01:32:10,496
This is where Billy lives.

981
01:32:10,566 --> 01:32:13,057
Wake up, you little shit!
You got company!

982
01:32:14,136 --> 01:32:16,627
Want to know how
I knew he was here?

983
01:32:18,107 --> 01:32:20,075
'Cause I put him here.

984
01:32:20,142 --> 01:32:21,575
Billy Mahoney!

985
01:32:22,678 --> 01:32:25,408
Stop, Nelson.
No, don't do it!

986
01:32:32,655 --> 01:32:33,986
Please stop.

987
01:33:05,187 --> 01:33:09,487
I was taken away from my family
when I was nine years old.

988
01:33:09,558 --> 01:33:12,527
I was sent
to Stoneham School for Boys.

989
01:33:12,595 --> 01:33:15,792
I thought I'd paid my dues!

990
01:33:15,865 --> 01:33:18,425
It was an accident.

991
01:33:18,501 --> 01:33:20,560
Let's go home, okay?

992
01:33:21,637 --> 01:33:23,195
Dave's right.

993
01:33:26,075 --> 01:33:28,202
I can still make amends.

994
01:33:28,277 --> 01:33:29,835
How?

995
01:33:44,426 --> 01:33:46,917
Joe, I gotta borrow your car.

996
01:33:50,199 --> 01:33:52,724
Nelson, wait!

997
01:34:00,042 --> 01:34:02,203
Oh, my God.

998
01:34:36,812 --> 01:34:38,336
Hello?

999
01:34:38,414 --> 01:34:40,177
What?

1000
01:34:40,249 --> 01:34:41,910
Where?

1001
01:34:41,984 --> 01:34:45,545
Ah, Jesus. All right.
Hold on a minute.

1002
01:34:56,398 --> 01:34:59,060
Nelson freaked out.
Joe and Steckle are stranded.

1003
01:35:00,436 --> 01:35:03,564
You be all right alone?
Are you sure?

1004
01:37:46,935 --> 01:37:48,368
Daddy.

1005
01:37:57,346 --> 01:37:58,813
Sweetheart.

1006
01:38:03,185 --> 01:38:04,709
I'm sorry.

1007
01:38:10,526 --> 01:38:13,051
Will you forgive me?

1008
01:38:13,128 --> 01:38:15,790
Will you ever forgive me?

1009
01:38:33,549 --> 01:38:35,813
Oh, my daddy!

1010
01:38:49,398 --> 01:38:54,495
Billy Mahoney died 17 years ago.
Nelson feels responsible.

1011
01:38:54,570 --> 01:38:59,030
- Jesus Christ! Any idea where he went?
- Something about making amends.

1012
01:38:59,107 --> 01:39:01,667
How can you make amends
with somebody who's dead?

1013
01:39:01,743 --> 01:39:05,611
- Would he try to flatline without us?
- That would be suicide.

1014
01:39:20,095 --> 01:39:23,428
No, it's Nelson.

1015
01:39:23,499 --> 01:39:26,525
Where are you?
David's trying to find you.

1016
01:39:29,338 --> 01:39:31,602
I wanted to say I was sorry.

1017
01:39:31,673 --> 01:39:33,197
Please tell David...

1018
01:39:34,409 --> 01:39:36,877
I'm sorry for getting
any of you involved.

1019
01:39:36,945 --> 01:39:40,073
No. You don't understand.
None of that matters now.

1020
01:39:44,686 --> 01:39:47,348
Everything matters.

1021
01:39:47,422 --> 01:39:50,016
Everything we do matters.

1022
01:39:51,093 --> 01:39:53,391
That's why I'm going under again.

1023
01:39:53,462 --> 01:39:54,656
Wait.

1024
01:39:54,730 --> 01:39:57,563
- Good-bye, Rachel.
- Tell me where you are.

1025
01:39:57,633 --> 01:40:00,761
- I really am sorry.
- Please wait.

1026
01:40:27,195 --> 01:40:30,562
- We're paying for our arrogance.
- Save it, Randy.

1027
01:41:04,533 --> 01:41:06,626
Good thing I didn't flatline.

1028
01:41:06,702 --> 01:41:11,639
My 350-pound baby-sitter would chase me
with a pastrami sandwich I stole.

1029
01:41:19,548 --> 01:41:22,346
Okay, Billy Mahoney, come on.

1030
01:42:16,438 --> 01:42:18,372
I'm gonna catch you!

1031
01:43:04,453 --> 01:43:07,115
Oh, God!
Body temp down to 78.

1032
01:43:07,189 --> 01:43:10,352
- Potassium. He used potassium!
- Christ!

1033
01:43:13,528 --> 01:43:15,052
Electrodes!

1034
01:43:15,130 --> 01:43:16,688
Calcium in.

1035
01:43:16,765 --> 01:43:18,926
300. Clear!

1036
01:43:21,837 --> 01:43:23,634
- Nothing.
- Go again.

1037
01:43:23,705 --> 01:43:26,765
- Clear!
- Nothing.

1038
01:43:37,018 --> 01:43:40,545
Up to 360. Clear!

1039
01:43:40,622 --> 01:43:42,783
Nothing.
I can't hear anything.

1040
01:43:42,858 --> 01:43:46,760
- He called. It's been over nine minutes.
- Nine minutes?

1041
01:43:46,828 --> 01:43:49,194
Let's intubate.
1-1,000.

1042
01:43:49,264 --> 01:43:52,665
2-1,000. 3-1,000.
4-1,000. 5-1,000.

1043
01:43:52,734 --> 01:43:55,168
- Breathe!
- Damn! The trachea's too tight.

1044
01:43:55,237 --> 01:43:57,569
Try again.

1045
01:44:01,543 --> 01:44:02,601
Come on!

1046
01:44:02,677 --> 01:44:04,440
Stop, Billy!

1047
01:44:04,513 --> 01:44:07,346
Stop, Billy! Stop!

1048
01:44:07,415 --> 01:44:08,780
Get him!

1049
01:44:13,688 --> 01:44:15,656
Eppy in!

1050
01:44:17,459 --> 01:44:19,427
- Breathe!
- Nothing.

1051
01:44:19,494 --> 01:44:22,827
- 88 degrees.
- Get 4 milligrams of atropine ready.

1052
01:44:33,575 --> 01:44:37,375
- All right. Atropine intratracheal.
- This is a truckload.

1053
01:44:37,445 --> 01:44:40,278
This has got to work.
Come on back, Nelson.

1054
01:44:40,348 --> 01:44:43,647
Come on, come on, Nelson.

1055
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:46,509
Come on.

1056
01:44:50,559 --> 01:44:52,891
- He's been dead 10 minutes.
- Bretylium!

1057
01:44:52,961 --> 01:44:55,486
- No, he's not in V-fib.
- He's dead.

1058
01:44:55,564 --> 01:44:57,759
- Eppy intracardial!
- No, Rachel!

1059
01:44:57,833 --> 01:44:59,562
Just do it!

1060
01:45:03,638 --> 01:45:05,503
Stop! Don't!

1061
01:45:06,975 --> 01:45:08,875
Don't do it, Billy!

1062
01:45:10,078 --> 01:45:12,444
I'm sorry!

1063
01:45:40,775 --> 01:45:42,208
Starting CPR!

1064
01:45:42,277 --> 01:45:45,405
1-1,000. 2-1,000. 3-1,000. 4-1,000.

1065
01:45:45,480 --> 01:45:48,040
It's been 12 minutes.
He is dead!

1066
01:45:48,116 --> 01:45:49,606
5-1,000. Breathe!

1067
01:45:54,489 --> 01:45:58,152
- Forget about it. We lost him!
- No, you son of a bitch!

1068
01:45:58,226 --> 01:46:00,626
Dave, stop it!

1069
01:46:08,970 --> 01:46:10,961
Let him go.

1070
01:46:27,055 --> 01:46:30,422
We're all responsible for this.

1071
01:46:30,492 --> 01:46:35,725
- Maybe we deserve this.
- No. It's not fair and it's not right.

1072
01:46:36,798 --> 01:46:42,327
I'm sorry, God. I'm sorry we stepped
on your fucking territory!

1073
01:46:42,404 --> 01:46:44,235
I'm sorry!

1074
01:46:45,340 --> 01:46:48,002
Isn't that enough?

1075
01:46:50,912 --> 01:46:52,777
Apparently not.

1076
01:46:54,349 --> 01:46:56,340
I'll call the police.

1077
01:46:59,087 --> 01:47:02,284
I could hear it in his voice
on the phone.

1078
01:47:03,358 --> 01:47:05,588
Nelson felt he deserved to die.

1079
01:47:05,660 --> 01:47:07,821
Bullshit!

1080
01:47:07,896 --> 01:47:11,423
It was a mistake.
He was just a little kid!

1081
01:47:12,701 --> 01:47:16,330
And he doesn't deserve to die!

1082
01:48:15,697 --> 01:48:18,564
Come on, Nelson!

1083
01:48:22,837 --> 01:48:25,032
Come on, Nelson.
Come on, come on.

1084
01:48:30,979 --> 01:48:32,412
Charged! Clear!

1085
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:33,970
Wait!

1086
01:48:35,950 --> 01:48:38,578
Oh, my God!

1087
01:48:38,653 --> 01:48:41,178
I got a pulse! We've got him!

1088
01:48:41,256 --> 01:48:43,622
- We've fucking got him!
- Nelson, pick up the beat!

1089
01:48:43,691 --> 01:48:47,457
Easy, easy. Don't rush him.
Oh, my God.

1090
01:48:47,529 --> 01:48:50,862
Come on, Nelson, pick up the beat.

1091
01:48:50,932 --> 01:48:53,196
Don't rush him.

1092
01:49:00,475 --> 01:49:02,500
That's it. That's it.

1093
01:49:07,816 --> 01:49:09,943
There we go.

1094
01:49:13,855 --> 01:49:16,585
Hail Mary, praise Jesus,
all that stuff.

1095
01:49:16,658 --> 01:49:18,751
Thank you, Jesus.

1096
01:49:18,827 --> 01:49:20,317
Hi, Nelson.

1097
01:49:21,496 --> 01:49:22,929
Don't talk.

1098
01:49:22,997 --> 01:49:24,988
I've got to get this on tape.

1099
01:49:41,916 --> 01:49:43,349
He said...

1100
01:49:47,155 --> 01:49:49,419
it wasn't such a good day to die.

1101
01:50:03,738 --> 01:50:05,467
Thank you.
