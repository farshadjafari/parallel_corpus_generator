2
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,840
Hello, Quinn.

3
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:25,840
Good morning, Quinn.
How's it going, mate?

4
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:26,978
What's up, guys?

5
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:28,747
Working the late shift,
are you?

6
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:31,216
Ha! Someone's got to
clean up after you guys.

7
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:44,429
All right, Quinn.

8
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,430
Oi, oi, oi.
Come on, then.

9
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,525
You're not havin' one
yourself, then?

10
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:51,797
No. I'm trying to cut back.

11
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,743
You heard from the school,
then, didn't you?

12
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,007
Down you go.

13
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,734
Good night, lads.

14
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:24,735
- See you, Karen.
- Great work. Have a good weekend.

15
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,137
Oi, Karen,
here's the new recruit.

16
00:03:26,138 --> 00:03:28,572
- Employment office is up top.
- Hi, Mum!

17
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:30,641
Quinn, how are you, mate?

18
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,745
Have you been smoking?

19
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:36,544
No, I told you - I only smoke
when I've been drinking.

20
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:39,351
What's wrong?

21
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:40,485
Nothing.

22
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:43,216
Quinn... what is it?

23
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:52,556
You've got something
you want to show me.

24
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:12,349
You know what it says.

25
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:20,583
Scholarship was worth...
£3,000 a year.

26
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,026
We don't have that sort of money.

27
00:04:23,095 --> 00:04:25,154
Maybe we could ask Dad to pay.

28
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,035
Sorry.

29
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:31,036
Karen?

30
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,037
What?

31
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:33,605
Got a problem at number 4.

32
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,040
Jess says he's hit
some sort of a void.

33
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:59,725
Oh, that bitch hasn't a clue
to what she's doing.

34
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,634
Hey... Quinn.

35
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:07,901
And what brings you
to the arsehole of the world?

36
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,636
You're passing through it.
What does that make you?

37
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:14,879
Here.

38
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,314
Why don't you go inside
and have a wee look?

39
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,420
Wicked.

40
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:46,397
- I know it's still...
- Well, I covered it.

41
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,472
What - Quinn!

42
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:50,709
Mum, there's something
in there.

43
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,976
There's something
in the hole!

44
00:06:51,977 --> 00:06:53,178
Damn it, Jess!

45
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:54,746
It's unsafe conditions!

46
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,548
Here. Let's look at this void.

47
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:58,216
It's unsafe!

48
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:01,015
I'm just going to wash
your eyes out, okay?

49
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,520
Mum, we've got to go!

50
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:04,819
No, no.
We've got to do this fast.

51
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,915
Open your eyes.
Open them up. Open them.

52
00:07:06,992 --> 00:07:08,992
Oh.

53
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:15,065
Give me that.

54
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:33,517
Get in!

55
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,892
Mum, there was something
in there!

56
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,764
Come here!

57
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,298
Come on! Come on!

58
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:58,475
Mum!

59
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:18,028
Mum?

60
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:21,531
Mum?

61
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,000
Mum?

62
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,741
I've kept this for years,

63
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:39,250
because someday
it will be up to you.

64
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:41,809
I don't want you to be afraid.

65
00:08:41,887 --> 00:08:44,048
I want you to understand.

66
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,791
Knowledge is the only weapon
we've got left.

67
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,625
In the beginning, it was
ignorance that destroyed us.

68
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:55,463
I saw the first, but soon
the world saw millions.

69
00:08:55,534 --> 00:08:57,235
No one knew how they spawned
so fast.

70
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:58,903
They swarmed like locusts,

71
00:08:58,904 --> 00:09:00,872
burning everything in their path,

72
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:04,104
driven by one purpose -
to feed.

73
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:06,406
Even then, we couldn't believe
they were real.

74
00:09:06,478 --> 00:09:09,242
Ancient man had made them
into myths,

75
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:12,648
but nature had made something
far more terrible.

76
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:15,983
Too late, our scientists
discovered their true identity,

77
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:19,422
a species which had burned
the dinosaurs to dust,

78
00:09:19,491 --> 00:09:22,585
whose ash had brought on
ice ages,

79
00:09:22,661 --> 00:09:25,960
who, in eons past, had scorched
the world clean of life,

80
00:09:26,031 --> 00:09:29,057
Then starved, then slept,

81
00:09:29,134 --> 00:09:31,534
waiting for the Earth
to replenish itself,

82
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:34,402
waiting to start their cycle anew.

83
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:37,169
Our weapons shot fire back at them,

84
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,077
yet for every one of them
killed,

85
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,812
a hundred took its place.

86
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:42,813
They seemed invulnerable.

87
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:46,943
We could only look on
as our leaders used

88
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,453
their greatest arsenal
to destroy them.

89
00:09:49,521 --> 00:09:51,853
But in the end,
we only helped them,

90
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,791
till the world burned

91
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:57,489
and the few of us
that were left fled the cities,

92
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:59,758
found shelter where we could.

93
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:03,131
You have to understand our past

94
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:05,227
because you will decide our future.

95
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:06,771
They're starving now,

96
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:09,536
and they're more dangerous
than ever.

97
00:10:09,608 --> 00:10:11,838
But we have to go on.

98
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:14,402
We have to outlast them.

99
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,813
Only one species is getting
out of this alive.

100
00:10:33,832 --> 00:10:35,099
Hey, Quinn!

101
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,968
Come and have a look at this!

102
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:40,530
It's a straight drop now
from the water tower.

103
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:42,440
You just pull the plug,

104
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:45,672
500 gallons per minute
hits the walls.

105
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:49,380
Don't care about the specs,
Jerry.

106
00:10:49,381 --> 00:10:51,474
1200 centigrade. Can it take it?

107
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,251
Yeah. Course it can.

108
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:56,221
Remember, I used to build
blast furnaces for a living.

109
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:57,956
I know all about fire.

110
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,187
Of course you do.
Sorry, mate.

111
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,259
Nice one.

112
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:18,909
Eddie's gone psycho.

113
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:20,578
- Jared?
- Yeah, Quinn?

114
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,579
Keep 'em at it.
No slacking!

115
00:11:22,614 --> 00:11:24,614
You heard him. No slacking.

116
00:11:24,616 --> 00:11:26,616
Go!

117
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:34,721
...I shall always walk.

118
00:11:34,793 --> 00:11:36,818
Ye, though his brethren rose

119
00:11:36,895 --> 00:11:39,329
like locusts from the Earth, Quinn,

120
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:41,559
- no weapon could save me!
- Yeah.

121
00:11:41,633 --> 00:11:44,500
- No fire could extinguish theirs!
- Yeah.

122
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,629
- They will prepare...
- Cheers, mate.

123
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,508
What's up, Quinn?

124
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,501
What are you doing, Eddie?

125
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:19,938
Me and a few others,
we're going harvesting, Quinn.

126
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:21,239
No, you're not.

127
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,834
It's not ready.
We spoke about this.

128
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,469
Half the stuff's not ripe.
You pick it now, it won't germinate.

129
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:29,013
That means no seeds. That means
nothing to plant next season.

130
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,413
There won't be a next season.
We'll be starved to death.

131
00:12:31,483 --> 00:12:33,451
What is this?
We can do it, Eddie.

132
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:35,452
We decided, all of us,
you as well -

133
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:38,684
dig in, work together,
outlast them.

134
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:41,590
Kids can't eat hope, Quinn.
Edinburgh's gone.

135
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,118
We haven't heard from Pembury
or Norwich in two years!

136
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:46,864
We're on our own, Quinn.

137
00:12:46,865 --> 00:12:50,631
Yeah, we know that. That's why we have
to hang on. Maybe we are all that's left.

138
00:12:50,702 --> 00:12:53,933
Eight years I've listened
to you, and for what?

139
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:56,736
Two kids and a wife
buried on the road.

140
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,868
I'm not losing these, Quinn,

141
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,445
not when there's food out there.

142
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,246
Sorry, Eddie.

143
00:13:02,247 --> 00:13:03,614
You're not going anywhere.

144
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,708
- Give me the keys.
- You bloody take 'em from me.

145
00:13:06,885 --> 00:13:09,479
It's a community, not a prison.

146
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:13,585
Eddie... you can argue
as much as you like.

147
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:15,659
It makes no difference.

148
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:18,129
The point is,
if you go out those gates,

149
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:19,897
then you jeopardize
this community.

150
00:13:19,898 --> 00:13:22,196
You can stay out there,
because you're not coming back.

151
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,838
All right.

152
00:13:28,907 --> 00:13:30,907
I'm keeping these.

153
00:13:43,288 --> 00:13:46,451
Hey, Quinn.

154
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:49,517
You know, I'm your best friend,

155
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:52,393
and sometimes even I don't like you.

156
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:58,635
Sorry.

157
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,105
"Join me,"
the black knight says,

158
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,118
"then we can end
this conflict for ever."

159
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,186
Never!

160
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,060
"I'll never join you,"
the white knight says.

161
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:25,128
"You killed my father."

162
00:14:30,802 --> 00:14:32,802
Creedy!

163
00:14:33,705 --> 00:14:37,607
The black knight stares through
the holes in his shiny mask,

164
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:41,737
and he speaks words that burn
into our hero's heart forever.

165
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,420
"I... am your father."

166
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:55,692
No!

167
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,091
Did you make that up,
Mr. Quinn?

168
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,168
Course I did.

169
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:09,206
All right, kids.
Time for bed.

170
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,505
- No! One more!
- No!

171
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,807
Tomorrow. No, no.
Prayers first.

172
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:16,447
Tomorrow!

173
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:18,249
- "The Lion King"!
- Yeah! Yeah!

174
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,445
Tomorrow!
Prayers first!

175
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:26,957
Okay.

176
00:15:28,393 --> 00:15:30,418
Ready?

177
00:15:30,495 --> 00:15:32,827
What do we do when we wake?

178
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:37,096
Keep both eyes on the sky.

179
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:39,433
What do we do when we sleep?

180
00:15:39,504 --> 00:15:42,837
Keep one eye on the sky.

181
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:45,138
What do we do when we see them?

182
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:48,179
Dig hard, dig deep,

183
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:49,780
run for shelter,

184
00:15:49,781 --> 00:15:52,045
and never look back.

185
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,117
Well done.

186
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,452
Good night, guys.

187
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,453
Bedtime.

188
00:15:56,888 --> 00:15:57,888
Bedtime!

189
00:15:57,889 --> 00:15:59,889
Good night.

190
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:04,027
Why can't we stay up later?

191
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,450
Michael?

192
00:16:26,451 --> 00:16:28,152
Quinn's asleep.

193
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:31,122
I took the keys.
Let's go.

194
00:16:38,096 --> 00:16:40,758
You keep quiet.

195
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:58,008
Hello, Liam.

196
00:17:58,009 --> 00:18:01,274
Willem says it's dragon breath.

197
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:04,281
Don't you listen to him.
It's just the wind.

198
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:11,087
Okay.

199
00:19:41,379 --> 00:19:43,379
Oh, God.

200
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:47,484
Ajay, alarm.

201
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,297
Take cover, kids.
Come on, now.

202
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,799
There we go, then.

203
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,133
Okay, children!

204
00:20:03,134 --> 00:20:05,796
Head up!
One at a time!

205
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,004
1... 2...

206
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:10,168
Single file.
Single file.

207
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:15,746
Let's move!

208
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:17,747
Right.

209
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:22,251
Move the kids.
Let's go. Come on.

210
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:25,189
Creedy?

211
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,457
- Yeah?
- You got a count?

212
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,458
Yeah. We're good.

213
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:29,723
Quinn!

214
00:20:29,794 --> 00:20:31,128
Quinn!

215
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:33,129
In the field.

216
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:24,548
Dragons!

217
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:26,549
Go get Eddie.

218
00:21:54,779 --> 00:21:56,013
Rachel!

219
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:57,247
Rachel!

220
00:21:57,248 --> 00:21:59,248
I'm here!

221
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:01,218
Devon!

222
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:02,653
Devon!

223
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:03,954
- Devon!
- Michael!

224
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:06,150
- De... where's Michael?
- Michael?

225
00:22:07,525 --> 00:22:09,393
Michael! Michael!

226
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:11,394
You okay?

227
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:14,297
- Where's Matt?
- He's dead.

228
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:17,634
Eddie!

229
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:20,937
Let's go! Move!

230
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:38,046
- Come on! Go!
- Come on, Michael!

231
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:40,455
Go! Move!

232
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,960
Keep going! Come on!

233
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,611
Dad... w-what'll we do?

234
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:04,981
We're trapped!

235
00:23:16,761 --> 00:23:18,362
Come on!

236
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:19,830
Go!

237
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:23,130
- Move it!
- Hurry up!

238
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:25,328
Go! Come on!
Quick!

239
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:29,165
Get in there!
Get in!

240
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:48,825
You okay?

241
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:13,916
Devon!

242
00:24:13,918 --> 00:24:15,619
Come on, Creedy.
Come on, Creedy!

243
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,054
- It's gonna blow up!
- Back up! Back up! Back up!

244
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,090
Oh, my God! Back up!

245
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:22,091
I'm going as fast as I can!

246
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,030
Back up! Back up! Back up!

247
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:34,404
Stop! Quinn, stop!

248
00:24:34,405 --> 00:24:36,405
- Let me bloody go!
- No!

249
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:44,714
No, Quinn!

250
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,653
Devon's there!

251
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:55,091
Devon!

252
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,827
Devon!

253
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:06,336
He doesn't care about us.

254
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:09,100
He just wants the damn ash
off that field.

255
00:25:37,268 --> 00:25:39,793
Creedy's one-and-only
black label,

256
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,362
aged two weeks in a steel barrel.

257
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,208
Now, the secret's swallowing fast.

258
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:47,235
That way it just burns your
stomach and not your throat.

259
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:50,848
Go on.

260
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:52,449
Sip it and weep.

261
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,450
Poor bastard.

262
00:25:56,554 --> 00:25:58,055
Who? Eddie?

263
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,590
A father's not meant to bury
his kids.

264
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:01,225
It's supposed to be
the other way around.

265
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,459
Yeah, well,
he wouldn't have had to

266
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,861
- if he'd just listened, would he?
- No.

267
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:06,092
No, Creedy.
Maybe he was right.

268
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:09,622
It's easy to square your shoulders
and bear it when you don't have kids.

269
00:26:11,035 --> 00:26:12,836
Maybe there won't be
another harvest.

270
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:14,998
No. Not now,
with half the crop gone.

271
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,473
God knows how we're
going to get through.

272
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:21,812
You remember when we'd go out
and bring in 80%, 90% of it?

273
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,714
Not anymore.

274
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:25,979
Not in the last few years.

275
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,784
They're hungrier, too.

276
00:26:27,785 --> 00:26:29,553
Hey...

277
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:32,079
you're not giving up on me,
are you?

278
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,926
No.

279
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,726
I just thought
if we could hang on,

280
00:26:39,797 --> 00:26:42,288
somehow we'd make it through.

281
00:26:55,346 --> 00:26:59,009
This is a national civil defence
alert for all who can hear this...

282
00:26:59,083 --> 00:27:02,143
...no choice but to authorize
the use of nuclear weapons...

283
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:29,411
The sole survivor was
a 12-year-old boy...

284
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:41,749
Roger that.

285
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:44,818
I'm going in.
Stay high on my...

286
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:47,626
Charge all weapons.

287
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:52,729
Hey, Barlow,
I've got voices.

288
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:54,738
Ajay, what are you smoking?

289
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:56,739
I'm not messing with you, Barlow.

290
00:27:56,774 --> 00:27:57,774
Take a look.

291
00:27:57,775 --> 00:28:00,300
A look at what?

292
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:01,845
She's not moving.

293
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:04,371
Forget the bird
and use the scope, you wanker.

294
00:28:17,528 --> 00:28:19,528
Oh, dear.

295
00:28:24,802 --> 00:28:26,536
Creedy!

296
00:28:26,537 --> 00:28:27,838
Creedy!

297
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,898
I've got to go.

298
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:37,481
All right, lads, this isn't a drill!

299
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:40,517
Move it along!

300
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:42,152
Get those out.
One to Creedy.

301
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:43,754
Another one to Jared!

302
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:45,755
Here's Creedy's.

303
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,020
All right, all right!
Come on, then! Come on!

304
00:28:48,092 --> 00:28:50,092
Extra shells!

305
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:52,195
Come on!

306
00:28:52,196 --> 00:28:54,196
We haven't got all day!

307
00:29:25,496 --> 00:29:27,589
Marauders.

308
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:29,826
Years since we've seen them.

309
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,936
Well, look on the bright side.

310
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,204
At least we're not alone.

311
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,032
Oh.

312
00:30:36,033 --> 00:30:40,129
Only one thing worse
than a dragon...

313
00:30:40,204 --> 00:30:42,204
Americans.

314
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,345
Oh, what a dump.

315
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:57,746
Who's in charge?!

316
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:02,453
Well, that would be you, then.

317
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:18,203
Anything happens,
you know what to do.

318
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:20,938
Uh, no. I have no idea.

319
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:24,647
Me neither.

320
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:47,203
That's a big tank.

321
00:31:57,815 --> 00:32:00,443
You responsible for this place?

322
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:01,651
Who are you?

323
00:32:01,652 --> 00:32:04,018
Name's Van Zan,
Kentucky Irregulars.

324
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:06,088
You're a long way from home,
Van Zan. You lost?

325
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:11,884
Rebuilt a National Guard C5A.

326
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:15,091
Flew it 8,000 miles on 2 engines
and tried to set it down

327
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:18,897
on the old strip
outside of Manchester.

328
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:22,269
Lost 122 men and most of my fuel.

329
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,900
We need shelter and a place
to refit artillery.

330
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:27,604
We'll be out of your hair
by 18:00 hours tomorrow.

331
00:32:27,678 --> 00:32:30,044
That's a good story, especially
the bit about the plane,

332
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,446
but there hasn't been anything
in the air for 20 years.

333
00:32:32,516 --> 00:32:34,516
That's their territory.

334
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:37,779
It's my territory.
It's your territory.

335
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:39,189
They're just rentin' it.

336
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:41,190
Turn around, Van Zan.

337
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:48,163
Don't be a fool.

338
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:52,569
We can do this easy...

339
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:56,734
or we can do it real easy.

340
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:05,514
You try it.

341
00:33:09,987 --> 00:33:12,785
You ever seen one of these?

342
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:15,189
Not many men have.

343
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:17,523
Got it off the first one
I killed.

344
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:22,321
The plane was better.

345
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,062
So now you're a dragon killer.

346
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:27,161
That's not even original.

347
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:28,905
It was in a wheat field

348
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:32,501
just south of Coffeyville,
Kansas.

349
00:33:32,576 --> 00:33:34,576
It was late November.

350
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:36,612
It's a month of mist.

351
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:38,809
And we were caught in the open.

352
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:41,010
The sun was setting behind us.

353
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:43,178
There was nowhere to run.

354
00:33:43,254 --> 00:33:44,988
Twice it came in on us,

355
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:47,787
and twice it missed
the heart of us.

356
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:55,491
And that's when I had
an epiphany.

357
00:33:55,566 --> 00:34:01,061
You see, they have
great vision... in the day.

358
00:34:01,138 --> 00:34:05,802
And they have even better vision
at night.

359
00:34:05,876 --> 00:34:08,970
But in the failing light,
they can't focus.

360
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:13,582
Magic hour.

361
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:30,124
Coffeyville.

362
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:32,102
It's etched in American history

363
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:34,799
because the outlaw Dalton boys
were killed there.

364
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:37,432
Ordinary townsfolk rose up
and took 'em down.

365
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,405
Maybe you're the Dalton boys.

366
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:48,009
No, no...
we're the townsfolk.

367
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:59,925
You try anything...

368
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:02,431
I'll kill you.

369
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:08,305
Didn't get your name.

370
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:10,372
Quinn.

371
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:51,915
Well... I'm sure you've got

372
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:54,817
a perfectly good explanation
for this,

373
00:35:54,885 --> 00:35:56,885
but I'm buggered
if I know what it is.

374
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:00,623
He's a dragon slayer.

375
00:36:00,624 --> 00:36:02,392
A what?

376
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:05,089
He's a dragon slayer!

377
00:36:05,162 --> 00:36:06,830
Oh, he's a dragon slayer.

378
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,131
Oh, good.

379
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:10,862
And I suppose that makes you
King Arthur, does it?

380
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:13,233
Christ Almighty, Quinn.

381
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:15,304
I mean,
even if you believe that,

382
00:36:15,372 --> 00:36:17,372
and you'd have to be
an imbecile,

383
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:20,239
- do you not think we'd be easy meat for these guys?
- You weren't there.

384
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:21,644
Look at this guy.
Look. Look.

385
00:36:21,645 --> 00:36:23,943
I mean, he looks like...
like a... like a rogue Marine.

386
00:36:24,014 --> 00:36:27,347
You remember those guys?
Oh, yeah, sure.

387
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:29,252
They blew up plenty of dragons
in their time,

388
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:30,753
but they also took
half the world...

389
00:36:30,754 --> 00:36:32,779
You weren't there!
I saw his eyes, Creedy!

390
00:37:09,793 --> 00:37:12,227
Move it! Move it! Move it!

391
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:38,588
Great job.

392
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:42,025
We ran a 30-mile grid
in every direction... Nothing.

393
00:37:42,092 --> 00:37:44,092
Could be on the moon, Denton.

394
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:51,123
Quinn, this is Alexandra
Jensen, U.S. Cavalry.

395
00:37:51,201 --> 00:37:53,036
Oh. Captain Creedy.

396
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:54,137
Hey.

397
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:56,138
How you doin'?
Creedy.

398
00:37:56,206 --> 00:37:57,807
Denton Van Zan.

399
00:37:57,808 --> 00:37:59,142
How are you?

400
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:00,643
Excuse me.

401
00:38:00,644 --> 00:38:02,445
Who are they?

402
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:04,846
Archangels.

403
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,450
17 seconds.

404
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:10,682
Once they jump from the chopper,
that's their life expectancy.

405
00:38:10,754 --> 00:38:13,484
You never thought
of giving them parachutes?

406
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:15,557
They're not much help.
They're bulla men.

407
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:17,293
What?

408
00:38:17,294 --> 00:38:21,890
They were used by gladiators
to snare other men.

409
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,628
Not men, dragons.

410
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:28,468
So, you guys, uh,
jump out the chopper

411
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:31,736
and use a net to snare dragons?

412
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,409
Mm-hmm.

413
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:35,178
Ha. I mean, sure, yeah.

414
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:38,080
I mean, you would, wouldn't you?

415
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:56,592
Three watches, eight hours each.

416
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,135
All the kids in the shelter.

417
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:01,203
Rifles on the keep and walls.

418
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:02,672
Excuse me.

419
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:05,073
Aren't you forgetting
who let them in?

420
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:07,770
Don't mean I trust 'em.

421
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:16,017
All right, guys.

422
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:35,497
I just brewed a fresh pot, if
that's what you're looking for.

423
00:39:35,572 --> 00:39:37,699
A whetstone, actually.

424
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:43,545
Sure.

425
00:39:48,485 --> 00:39:50,119
Is that your son?

426
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:53,647
No. Got him from the pound.

427
00:39:55,325 --> 00:39:57,919
Hmm. Is that where you
get all your children?

428
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,931
I found him in a village
near Bray.

429
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:06,435
3 years old,
sitting with his mum.

430
00:40:06,503 --> 00:40:08,733
He kept trying to wake her up.

431
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:11,001
She had been dead for days.

432
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:17,205
We were making our way up here,
a few of us - me, Creedy, and Barlow.

433
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:19,281
No idea how we were gonna survive.

434
00:40:19,349 --> 00:40:22,944
Anyway, I grabbed him.

435
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,754
What else was I gonna do?

436
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,985
Leave him.

437
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:29,057
Most men would have...

438
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,493
especially back in the early years.

439
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:34,360
Everybody was just running
for their lives.

440
00:40:34,431 --> 00:40:36,763
Yeah. Well, I didn't.

441
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:41,130
Regretted it ever since,
of course.

442
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:58,086
What are you doing here?

443
00:41:00,824 --> 00:41:03,190
What do you want?

444
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:07,560
You want to know anything,
you ask Van Zan.

445
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:36,626
Goosh, you alive?!

446
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:38,627
Not even close, Denton.

447
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:45,201
Alex! Radios are down!

448
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:48,035
Cover the east ridge
and tell me what you see!

449
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:50,006
Men, get ready to rock 'n' roll!

450
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,007
We got a dragon to kill!

451
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:54,334
- Goosh, set the triangulators!
- Roger that!

452
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:57,778
Tito, Mead, Piscatella,
bounce your butts!

453
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:00,908
Move out!

454
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:42,891
Alex, what do you see?

455
00:42:44,294 --> 00:42:45,895
No sign of it.

456
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:48,330
Visibility is about 3 miles
on the deck.

457
00:42:48,398 --> 00:42:49,532
Roger that.

458
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:52,263
Stay on the deck
till I get the verticals up.

459
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:54,770
Copy that, Van Zan.

460
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:56,931
Waiting for triangulator.
Safety first, guys.

461
00:42:57,007 --> 00:42:59,635
Safety?! What part of this job
do you find safe?!

462
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:02,235
It's not you I'm worried
about. It's my chopper.

463
00:43:02,312 --> 00:43:05,406
Oh. Cold.

464
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:12,655
First vertical's up.

465
00:43:12,656 --> 00:43:14,390
Vertical 1 up, Alex.

466
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:16,391
Copy that.

467
00:43:25,836 --> 00:43:27,103
Second vertical is up.

468
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,871
Second vertical is up, Alex.

469
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:31,636
Now, once I have radar,
you go to 5,000 feet.

470
00:43:31,708 --> 00:43:34,040
Fly directly back
above my location.

471
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:37,080
Gideon, you and the boys bring
that bitch right down on my head,

472
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:38,414
and I'll take it from there.

473
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:40,016
Copy that, Van Zan.

474
00:43:40,017 --> 00:43:42,281
Alvarez, you're the bait.

475
00:43:42,352 --> 00:43:43,786
Jefferson, you and I
are the gunners.

476
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,421
We don't open our chutes

477
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:49,620
until you give us confirmation
that it's down, right?

478
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,390
Bogey on our tail,
200 yards!

479
00:43:55,465 --> 00:43:57,133
- Go, go, go, go!
- Roger!

480
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,398
I'll try to lose it up
in the clouds.

481
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:10,847
Piscatella, do you read me?

482
00:44:24,094 --> 00:44:27,086
God damn it, Piscatella!
Get your vertical up!

483
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:36,205
Come on, number 3!
Piscatella, that's you!

484
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:37,807
I'm almost there!

485
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:39,808
I'm almost at the top of the -

486
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:47,749
God damn it, Piscatella.
Come in.

487
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:51,087
Ajay?

488
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:53,556
Can you hear anything?

489
00:44:53,623 --> 00:44:55,157
Van Zan's trying
to take it on, Quinn,

490
00:44:55,158 --> 00:44:56,959
using some kind
of 3-d mapping device.

491
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,694
If they don't get
that third vertical up,

492
00:44:58,695 --> 00:45:00,695
Alex is flying blind.

493
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,797
Hyah! Ha! Hyah!

494
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,037
Yah!

495
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:10,063
Come on!

496
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:14,777
Van Zan, what's going on?

497
00:45:14,778 --> 00:45:17,406
I'm at altitude.
We're blind up here.

498
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:21,212
Can you give me some time? I'm having
trouble with the third vertical.

499
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:26,748
Come on, number 3!
Piscatella, that's you!

500
00:45:26,823 --> 00:45:28,823
Get your vertical up!

501
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:55,551
All right, Piscatella.

502
00:45:55,552 --> 00:45:56,685
Third vertical's up.

503
00:45:56,686 --> 00:45:58,686
Alex, we have visual.

504
00:45:59,689 --> 00:46:01,689
Monitor's coming up.

505
00:46:04,594 --> 00:46:06,687
Hold on!

506
00:46:06,763 --> 00:46:08,763
Alvarez!

507
00:46:14,871 --> 00:46:17,271
It's right on us!
It's right on us!

508
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:19,340
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go!

509
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:24,045
Damn it!

510
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:26,115
Talk to me, Alex!

511
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:28,516
Angels are flying.

512
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,394
Alex, do you have
a reading?!

513
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:50,639
Okay. Target... 1,500 feet.

514
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,973
Copy that.
Alvarez, do you have a visual?

515
00:46:54,044 --> 00:46:56,137
Negative.

516
00:46:58,782 --> 00:47:01,012
Damn it! It's right on top of me!
Shoot!

517
00:47:01,084 --> 00:47:03,177
Shoot at what?
I can't see a thing!

518
00:47:07,457 --> 00:47:09,457
Nets away!

519
00:47:12,929 --> 00:47:14,063
Great shot!

520
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:15,998
All right, Jefferson!

521
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:18,160
Roger that.

522
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:20,362
Alvarez, can you see it?

523
00:47:20,437 --> 00:47:22,530
Negative. I think it's down.

524
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,740
Copy that.

525
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:29,540
Shit! Alex, both nets
just flew right by me.

526
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:32,673
Alvarez, can you confirm
that it is down?

527
00:47:33,483 --> 00:47:34,917
Copy that!

528
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:38,854
Negative! It's on me!

529
00:47:55,105 --> 00:47:59,769
Jefferson, I'm not getting
any contact with Alvarez.

530
00:47:59,843 --> 00:48:01,310
Keep your eyes open.

531
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:02,611
Roger that.

532
00:48:02,612 --> 00:48:04,612
- Jefferson, look out!
- Oh, my...

533
00:48:14,858 --> 00:48:16,858
Gideon's down.

534
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:20,395
Piscatella.

535
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:22,627
- Piscatella, do you read me?
- Van Zan.

536
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:23,966
Who is this?

537
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:24,967
Quinn.

538
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:26,302
Quinn, where's Piscatella?

539
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:28,237
- He's gone.
- Are you ready to ride?

540
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,832
'Cause you got about 30 seconds
till the bitch is on top of you.

541
00:48:30,907 --> 00:48:32,174
You bring her to me.

542
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:35,440
You're the bait, Quinn,
1,600 pounds of horseflesh.

543
00:48:35,512 --> 00:48:37,878
Ride her right down my throat.
Do you read me?

544
00:48:37,948 --> 00:48:39,715
Ride the north road
to the quarry.

545
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:41,716
Bring her to me, Quinn.

546
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:46,120
I'm coming.

547
00:48:48,491 --> 00:48:50,491
Hmm? Here we go.

548
00:48:55,899 --> 00:48:57,899
Okay. Okay.

549
00:48:59,936 --> 00:49:02,097
Come on!

550
00:49:02,172 --> 00:49:06,939
Line up 20 yards
south by southwest!

551
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:09,205
Come on!

552
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,520
Come on!

553
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:24,526
1,200 yards.

554
00:49:24,527 --> 00:49:28,361
Wind velocity: 10.2
north by northwest.

555
00:49:28,431 --> 00:49:30,729
Come on! Come on!

556
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,800
Hyah!

557
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:58,113
Yeah, this is really
good stuff. Thanks.

558
00:51:00,323 --> 00:51:02,091
Hey, good day, Quinn, yeah?

559
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:03,959
All right, Quinn.

560
00:51:05,995 --> 00:51:07,396
Hats off to you, mate.

561
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:09,397
Yeah!

562
00:52:01,751 --> 00:52:04,845
Envy the country
that has heroes, huh?

563
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:14,797
I say pity the country
that needs 'em.

564
00:52:19,135 --> 00:52:21,729
What are you celebrating?

565
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:25,901
One dragon down,
three men dead? Oh, yeah.

566
00:52:25,975 --> 00:52:30,378
At that rate, we might just be
getting somewhere in about 320 years.

567
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:33,575
Is that what you want?

568
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:36,175
You want a little accommodation?

569
00:52:38,688 --> 00:52:41,851
These beasts live on ash.

570
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:44,655
They feed on death.

571
00:52:44,727 --> 00:52:47,218
There's no middle ground...

572
00:52:47,297 --> 00:52:52,462
not for them, not for us.

573
00:52:52,535 --> 00:52:56,494
And sure as hell not for my
men who died out there today.

574
00:53:01,244 --> 00:53:04,509
But you go ahead.

575
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:10,281
Have your little... soiree.

576
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:12,446
Personally, you disgust me.

577
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:22,331
We bury our dead at dawn.

578
00:54:36,072 --> 00:54:39,132
What are you doing here, Quinn?

579
00:54:40,843 --> 00:54:45,143
You're standing on ground
where I've buried hundreds.

580
00:54:45,214 --> 00:54:46,548
This is my home.

581
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:49,382
I'm asking the questions.

582
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:51,452
What are you doing here?

583
00:54:53,122 --> 00:54:56,614
I lead... you follow.

584
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:20,481
I kept these for you.

585
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:23,748
They sent them off proud, Alex.

586
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:26,721
Alex is the keeper
of the dead, Quinn.

587
00:55:26,789 --> 00:55:27,990
She's our memory.

588
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,958
When this thing is over,

589
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:32,223
she's gonna build a wall
with those things.

590
00:55:32,295 --> 00:55:35,162
And, unfortunately, it's
gonna be a very long wall.

591
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:37,426
I'm out of resources, Quinn.

592
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,500
I'm out of men.

593
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:41,236
Alex, tell him.

594
00:55:41,237 --> 00:55:45,037
- Did you see the one we brought down, the big bull?
- Yeah.

595
00:55:45,108 --> 00:55:47,474
Well, it wasn't.
It was a female.

596
00:55:47,543 --> 00:55:50,444
There was at least one egg,
probably more.

597
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:54,108
We've hit over 200 of them,
and as far as we can tell,

598
00:55:54,183 --> 00:55:55,917
they're all females.

599
00:55:55,918 --> 00:55:58,580
How about you, Quinn?
You ever seen a male?

600
00:55:58,655 --> 00:55:59,655
I don't know.

601
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:01,123
When I'm running for my life,

602
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:02,924
I don't stop to look at the plumbing.

603
00:56:02,925 --> 00:56:04,925
Well, we have.

604
00:56:04,927 --> 00:56:07,191
Alex discovered it
about two years back.

605
00:56:07,296 --> 00:56:09,764
She worked out how
the fire in the glands...

606
00:56:09,832 --> 00:56:12,528
Two glands in the mouth
secrete separate chemicals, yep.

607
00:56:12,602 --> 00:56:13,769
That's right.

608
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:16,762
Combine in exhalation -
nitro-napalm.

609
00:56:16,839 --> 00:56:19,205
Yeah. Well, the chemical
engineer is dead now.

610
00:56:19,275 --> 00:56:20,375
That was his theory.

611
00:56:20,376 --> 00:56:22,742
We figure they're like fish.

612
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:24,871
The females spawn the eggs.

613
00:56:24,947 --> 00:56:28,906
One male passes over
and fertilizes thousands.

614
00:56:28,985 --> 00:56:31,010
Did you hear what she said, Quinn?

615
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:32,521
One male.

616
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:35,218
That's why we never see any
others, 'cause there's only one.

617
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:37,291
Now, we tracked the epidemiology
of these things,

618
00:56:37,293 --> 00:56:38,927
and we found out
where they're from.

619
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:40,295
And that is why we're here.

620
00:56:40,296 --> 00:56:45,666
We kill the male,
we kill the species.

621
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:47,636
We're going to London.

622
00:56:47,637 --> 00:56:50,333
Good luck.
It's that way.

623
00:56:50,406 --> 00:56:52,601
No, I need soldiers.

624
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:55,838
- Quinn, are you listening to me? I need men.
- Men from Pembury went to London.

625
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:58,403
And maybe she's right, because
they disturbed something.

626
00:56:58,481 --> 00:56:59,648
90 of them died,

627
00:56:59,649 --> 00:57:01,649
and then it backtracked them
to their fortress.

628
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:03,879
And you haven't seen
destruction like that, Van Zan...

629
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:05,020
not even in this world.

630
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:06,254
So we walk over dead men -

631
00:57:06,255 --> 00:57:08,123
Not with my people, you won't!

632
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:10,058
I've got a castle full of them.

633
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:11,927
I'm trying to keep them alive.

634
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:14,795
You're just letting them
die slower.

635
00:57:14,864 --> 00:57:16,864
I said no.

636
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:18,933
I made a mistake letting you
through those gates.

637
00:57:19,001 --> 00:57:21,697
I saw something in your eyes.
I thought it was awe. I was wrong.

638
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:23,864
It's madness. You're insane.

639
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:27,034
And I want you out
before you do more damage.

640
00:57:32,682 --> 00:57:35,173
Look out the window.

641
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:38,152
Eden's not burning.
It's burnt.

642
00:57:47,296 --> 00:57:50,026
Why don't you want to go?

643
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:55,260
What happened there?

644
00:57:57,406 --> 00:58:01,103
My mother was working on a railway
tunnel- project engineer.

645
00:58:01,177 --> 00:58:03,338
She died there, okay?

646
00:58:07,049 --> 00:58:09,643
You've seen it, haven't you?

647
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:16,148
Quinn!

648
00:58:16,225 --> 00:58:18,386
Trouble.

649
00:58:21,804 --> 00:58:23,863
There's nothing magical
about 'em.

650
00:58:23,939 --> 00:58:26,100
They're made up
of a collection of organs.

651
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:28,200
They have a mind, a heart,
and a liver.

652
00:58:28,277 --> 00:58:30,939
You take out one of these,
you bring down the beast!

653
00:58:36,185 --> 00:58:39,882
Is that it?
Four of you?

654
00:58:42,691 --> 00:58:44,192
Eddie.

655
00:58:44,193 --> 00:58:46,457
Eddie, what you doin'?

656
00:58:46,529 --> 00:58:48,430
You got kids, man.

657
00:58:48,431 --> 00:58:51,889
That's why I'm going,
Creedy. That's why.

658
00:58:55,237 --> 00:58:58,365
The volunteer section of this campaign's
now over. It's time for the draft.

659
00:58:58,441 --> 00:59:00,375
Tito, Mead...

660
00:59:00,376 --> 00:59:02,277
get the six strongest men
they have and load 'em up.

661
00:59:02,278 --> 00:59:03,545
- Right.
- Got it.

662
00:59:03,546 --> 00:59:06,071
Dig your own holes.
Die in 'em.

663
00:59:08,217 --> 00:59:09,984
Oi!

664
00:59:09,985 --> 00:59:11,219
I said no!

665
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:13,220
No, Quinn!

666
00:59:17,893 --> 00:59:19,893
Get out of my way, Quinn.

667
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:56,998
Okay, okay.

668
00:59:56,999 --> 00:59:59,024
Get him off!

669
00:59:59,101 --> 01:00:03,231
I'll kill ya!
I'll kill ya!

670
01:00:03,305 --> 01:00:06,035
I'll kill ya!
I'll kill ya!

671
01:00:06,108 --> 01:00:07,475
- That's what we need.
- I'll kill ya!

672
01:00:07,476 --> 01:00:10,172
He's gonna bring it
back here!

673
01:00:10,513 --> 01:00:12,247
All right.

674
01:00:12,248 --> 01:00:14,978
All right, he's had enough.

675
01:00:19,655 --> 01:00:21,655
Go, London!

676
01:00:24,827 --> 01:00:27,387
Come on!
Move 'em out!

677
01:00:27,463 --> 01:00:29,556
Come on!
Grab those guys!

678
01:00:36,705 --> 01:00:38,764
You, you, you!

679
01:00:55,524 --> 01:00:57,058
He would have killed you.

680
01:00:57,059 --> 01:00:58,459
He doesn't feel things.

681
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:02,089
That's the only way
he can do what he does.

682
01:01:03,966 --> 01:01:05,767
Here. Take this.

683
01:01:05,768 --> 01:01:08,066
Iodine.

684
01:01:08,137 --> 01:01:10,970
Hurts like hell,
but it kills anything.

685
01:01:39,868 --> 01:01:42,302
Good luck, Quinn.

686
01:02:10,366 --> 01:02:13,460
You too busy to say goodbye?

687
01:02:13,535 --> 01:02:15,103
You're not my father.

688
01:02:15,104 --> 01:02:16,504
You can't stop me, Quinn.

689
01:02:16,505 --> 01:02:18,666
I can be an archangel.

690
01:02:18,741 --> 01:02:20,508
Gideon says he'll teach me.

691
01:02:20,509 --> 01:02:22,210
17 seconds.

692
01:02:22,211 --> 01:02:24,270
Did he tell you
that's how long they live?

693
01:02:24,346 --> 01:02:26,746
Not the good ones.
Gideon's an 8-year veteran.

694
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:28,349
At least
they're still killing them.

695
01:02:28,350 --> 01:02:32,548
A couple of years, Jared. That's
all I'm asking for. Give me that.

696
01:02:32,621 --> 01:02:35,613
After that, you'll be old
enough, and you can lead 'em.

697
01:02:35,691 --> 01:02:38,353
That's what I want. Out of
everyone, you're the best.

698
01:02:38,427 --> 01:02:40,427
It's a waste of time,
Quinn - all of it.

699
01:02:40,462 --> 01:02:44,899
You're right.
I'm not your father.

700
01:02:44,967 --> 01:02:47,367
I can't... lock you in.
I can't make you stay.

701
01:02:47,436 --> 01:02:50,462
And if you think you're man
enough to speak like that,

702
01:02:50,539 --> 01:02:52,632
then I guess
you're man enough to go.

703
01:03:04,853 --> 01:03:07,822
Goodbye, Jared.

704
01:03:07,890 --> 01:03:10,791
You look after yourself.

705
01:04:40,649 --> 01:04:43,379
That dragon smells like shit.

706
01:04:43,452 --> 01:04:45,579
are you gonna burn it?

707
01:04:45,654 --> 01:04:48,851
I love it.

708
01:04:48,924 --> 01:04:51,984
They hate the smell
of their dead.

709
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:55,359
It's the only thing
that scares 'em.

710
01:04:58,066 --> 01:05:00,933
It might buy us
a couple of days.

711
01:05:09,711 --> 01:05:11,711
Sorry, Quinn.

712
01:05:16,552 --> 01:05:18,552
So am I.

713
01:05:21,623 --> 01:05:24,251
This time I was thinking
I got rid of you for sure.

714
01:07:52,341 --> 01:07:55,674
Van Zan, what are we doing?

715
01:07:55,744 --> 01:07:58,406
Do you see a way through?

716
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,281
Negative.
It's blocked for miles.

717
01:08:00,282 --> 01:08:01,582
As far as the river, Denton.

718
01:08:01,583 --> 01:08:02,984
Head back, Alex.

719
01:08:02,985 --> 01:08:05,920
- Find me a way around.
- Copy.

720
01:08:18,433 --> 01:08:20,663
Is this Pembury?

721
01:08:20,736 --> 01:08:22,829
This looks like Pembury.

722
01:08:22,904 --> 01:08:24,305
Do you want to turn back?

723
01:08:24,306 --> 01:08:25,973
Nukes must have done this.

724
01:08:25,974 --> 01:08:27,708
Nukes didn't do this.

725
01:08:27,709 --> 01:08:29,709
Should we set
the triangulators?

726
01:08:34,182 --> 01:08:37,982
No time.

727
01:08:38,053 --> 01:08:40,214
Man the 50-cal,
lock and load,

728
01:08:40,288 --> 01:08:42,288
cut the engines,
and take your positions.

729
01:08:46,728 --> 01:08:49,458
You heard him!
Lock and load!

730
01:08:49,531 --> 01:08:51,556
Let's move! Let's move!

731
01:09:15,824 --> 01:09:17,558
I think it's playing with us.

732
01:09:17,559 --> 01:09:20,392
It's not playing with us.

733
01:09:20,462 --> 01:09:22,462
It's setting us up.

734
01:10:11,313 --> 01:10:13,313
Easy. Easy.

735
01:10:13,315 --> 01:10:15,315
Easy, girl.

736
01:10:17,152 --> 01:10:19,484
Van Zan, it's Alex.
Can you read me?

737
01:10:19,554 --> 01:10:22,682
Van Zan, can you hear me?

738
01:10:24,926 --> 01:10:29,090
Van Zan, if you can hear me,
I'm coming back.

739
01:10:29,164 --> 01:10:31,164
Can anybody hear me?

740
01:10:56,024 --> 01:10:59,221
Van Zan!

741
01:10:59,294 --> 01:11:02,786
Van Zan!

742
01:11:02,864 --> 01:11:05,059
Van Zan!

743
01:11:15,277 --> 01:11:17,277
Denton...

744
01:11:17,345 --> 01:11:19,472
what happened?

745
01:11:19,548 --> 01:11:22,517
It was him.

746
01:11:26,221 --> 01:11:29,554
Where are the soldiers?

747
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:34,954
One pass.

748
01:11:35,030 --> 01:11:37,965
He flew over just once.

749
01:11:42,871 --> 01:11:44,896
The castle.

750
01:12:18,506 --> 01:12:20,974
Hyah!

751
01:12:21,042 --> 01:12:23,306
Hyah!

752
01:12:31,453 --> 01:12:34,445
Get the hell out of there!
Take cover, everybody!

753
01:12:34,522 --> 01:12:36,056
Get it moving!

754
01:12:39,628 --> 01:12:41,628
Anybody upstairs?!

755
01:12:45,634 --> 01:12:48,694
Hyah!

756
01:13:34,816 --> 01:13:38,343
Jared!

757
01:13:39,688 --> 01:13:41,688
- Creedy!
- Quinn!

758
01:13:51,099 --> 01:13:53,099
Have you got them all?

759
01:13:55,203 --> 01:13:57,104
Creedy, help!

760
01:13:57,105 --> 01:13:59,006
I'll get him!
You take her downstairs!

761
01:13:59,007 --> 01:14:03,910
Hurry up! That big boy won't
stop until it's killed us all!

762
01:14:03,979 --> 01:14:05,913
Katie - she won't move.

763
01:14:05,914 --> 01:14:08,747
Come on, Katie.
Willem, get on my shoulder.

764
01:14:08,817 --> 01:14:11,183
Katie, come on.
Let go of the wall.

765
01:14:11,252 --> 01:14:13,252
Let go. Let go!

766
01:14:24,833 --> 01:14:27,768
Take her! Take her!

767
01:14:36,411 --> 01:14:39,005
Everybody, move to the back!

768
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:41,548
I've got all the kids.
Okay, keep pushing up.

769
01:14:41,616 --> 01:14:43,616
Katie's blanket.

770
01:14:55,897 --> 01:14:57,831
Where is everyone?!

771
01:14:57,832 --> 01:14:59,533
Don't you go up there, Quinn!

772
01:14:59,534 --> 01:15:01,934
There's 65 people up there,
Creedy. I'm going!

773
01:15:02,003 --> 01:15:03,704
God damn it, Quinn.

774
01:15:03,705 --> 01:15:05,832
Don't you dare leave!
It's too dangerous!

775
01:15:05,907 --> 01:15:07,274
I'll clean it up.

776
01:15:07,275 --> 01:15:08,842
Creedy!

777
01:15:20,755 --> 01:15:22,755
Noooo!

778
01:15:27,462 --> 01:15:30,295
Creedy!

779
01:15:31,566 --> 01:15:33,300
No!

780
01:15:33,301 --> 01:15:36,498
No!

781
01:15:56,357 --> 01:16:00,987
- Creedy!
- Creedy!

782
01:16:06,267 --> 01:16:08,394
What do we do when we wake?

783
01:16:08,470 --> 01:16:12,429
Keep both eyes on the sky.

784
01:16:12,507 --> 01:16:14,873
What do we do...

785
01:16:16,945 --> 01:16:19,914
What do we...

786
01:16:19,981 --> 01:16:22,575
What do we do when we sleep?

787
01:16:22,650 --> 01:16:26,848
Keep one eye on the sky.

788
01:16:26,921 --> 01:16:29,219
What do we do when we see him?

789
01:16:29,290 --> 01:16:33,158
Dig hard, dig deep, run for shelter,

790
01:16:33,228 --> 01:16:35,696
and never look back.

791
01:17:15,670 --> 01:17:18,833
Jared...

792
01:17:20,575 --> 01:17:22,342
We're alive!

793
01:17:22,343 --> 01:17:24,211
We're in here!

794
01:17:24,212 --> 01:17:26,212
Push!

795
01:17:29,517 --> 01:17:31,517
Back away!

796
01:17:56,344 --> 01:17:58,344
You were right.

797
01:18:55,603 --> 01:18:58,299
I salvaged what I could
from your armoury.

798
01:19:00,141 --> 01:19:02,109
We got one rifle,

799
01:19:02,110 --> 01:19:04,237
two automatics, two crossbows,

800
01:19:04,312 --> 01:19:06,312
and explosive heads.

801
01:19:13,821 --> 01:19:17,120
You, me, and Alex -

802
01:19:17,191 --> 01:19:19,092
down the coast in the chopper.

803
01:19:19,093 --> 01:19:21,721
Stay tight to the cliffs.

804
01:19:21,796 --> 01:19:24,594
The Thames will take us right
into the heart of London.

805
01:19:24,666 --> 01:19:26,666
I know where he lives.

806
01:19:27,802 --> 01:19:30,737
Magic hour -

807
01:19:30,805 --> 01:19:33,968
you say that's when
they're the weakest.

808
01:19:34,042 --> 01:19:35,709
We'll see.

809
01:19:35,710 --> 01:19:38,907
You're going home.

810
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:40,881
Jared!

811
01:19:40,882 --> 01:19:42,882
Yeah, Quinn?

812
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:47,320
You keep them safe.

813
01:21:14,242 --> 01:21:17,405
Well, this town's
gone to hell.

814
01:21:17,478 --> 01:21:19,537
They must have heard us coming.

815
01:21:19,614 --> 01:21:23,311
What's stopping them?

816
01:21:23,384 --> 01:21:24,518
It's not us.

817
01:21:24,519 --> 01:21:27,352
Either way, we gotta
get in there.

818
01:21:27,422 --> 01:21:30,152
Come on, guys. We're
outnumbered hundreds to 3.

819
01:21:30,224 --> 01:21:32,886
I know this city
from the sky down,

820
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:35,485
and I know it
from the bottom up.

821
01:21:35,563 --> 01:21:38,054
If we can get in quiet, I can
sneak us into some tunnels.

822
01:21:38,132 --> 01:21:40,132
That should get us close.

823
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:47,765
Good Christ.

824
01:21:54,449 --> 01:21:57,043
Did he see us?

825
01:22:05,059 --> 01:22:10,463
They must be starving.
They're eating their own.

826
01:22:10,531 --> 01:22:14,729
Oh, we're dead.

827
01:22:14,802 --> 01:22:16,963
Look on the bright side.

828
01:22:17,038 --> 01:22:20,064
Now we've got him
outnumbered 3 to 1.

829
01:22:22,944 --> 01:22:25,879
Now... you ready?

830
01:22:25,947 --> 01:22:27,681
Yeah.

831
01:22:27,682 --> 01:22:29,775
Quinn...

832
01:22:29,851 --> 01:22:32,547
You lead. We follow.

833
01:23:02,550 --> 01:23:04,882
There's an underground
passage -

834
01:23:04,952 --> 01:23:07,147
leads to the construction site!

835
01:23:07,221 --> 01:23:10,247
Down here!

836
01:23:28,442 --> 01:23:30,442
Clear.

837
01:23:47,461 --> 01:23:50,294
Four tunnels meet at this shaft.

838
01:23:50,364 --> 01:23:52,198
Leads up to a square. There
used to be buildings up there.

839
01:23:52,199 --> 01:23:53,700
If they're still around,
could be good coverage.

840
01:23:53,701 --> 01:23:56,033
Yeah, if it goes to the street,
that's what we take.

841
01:23:56,103 --> 01:23:58,103
Alex, give me the sticks.

842
01:24:03,611 --> 01:24:05,704
Quinn, these are
highly volatile heads.

843
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:07,647
You fire them
with your crossbow.

844
01:24:07,648 --> 01:24:10,310
Now, when you...

845
01:24:12,286 --> 01:24:14,379
He knows we're here.
Shh.

846
01:24:14,455 --> 01:24:17,356
Okay.

847
01:24:17,425 --> 01:24:19,425
How tall is that shaft?

848
01:24:19,460 --> 01:24:22,020
150 feet.

849
01:24:22,096 --> 01:24:25,395
All right.
Here's the plan -

850
01:24:25,466 --> 01:24:28,162
when we get to street level, we gotta
bring that bull's ass to the ground,

851
01:24:28,235 --> 01:24:30,170
and I'm gonna take care
of that.

852
01:24:30,171 --> 01:24:32,072
Now, one shot's gonna kill him,
and it's gonna be with this.

853
01:24:32,073 --> 01:24:34,906
He only exposes his chest
before he breathes fire.

854
01:24:34,976 --> 01:24:37,342
Now, these are magnesium-tip
C-4 arrows,

855
01:24:37,411 --> 01:24:39,079
and they only fly about 50 feet.

856
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:41,080
So, when you fire, you gotta
be standing in the furnace.

857
01:24:41,148 --> 01:24:44,049
So do not hesitate.
If you do, we die.

858
01:24:51,258 --> 01:24:53,258
Ah, he's playing hide-and-seek.

859
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:56,093
More like cat and mouse.

860
01:25:21,322 --> 01:25:23,381
Quinn!

861
01:25:23,457 --> 01:25:25,755
Use it!

862
01:25:42,810 --> 01:25:45,745
Oh, he's eating it up.

863
01:25:45,813 --> 01:25:49,146
I can't see a damn thing, Quinn.

864
01:25:49,216 --> 01:25:51,275
What am I looking at?

865
01:25:51,352 --> 01:25:54,048
This is an enclosed square.
It's about 100 meters across.

866
01:25:54,121 --> 01:25:56,022
There's a building right
in the middle.

867
01:25:56,023 --> 01:25:58,023
That chimney looks down
over the lot of it.

868
01:25:58,059 --> 01:26:00,059
What do you think?

869
01:26:01,495 --> 01:26:04,055
I don't know yet.

870
01:26:04,131 --> 01:26:07,066
Hey...

871
01:26:07,134 --> 01:26:09,134
you scared?

872
01:26:09,837 --> 01:26:11,271
No.

873
01:26:11,272 --> 01:26:13,502
It was your idea
to come to London.

874
01:26:14,909 --> 01:26:18,675
Yeah, I thought
I'd be at 3,500 feet.

875
01:26:18,746 --> 01:26:22,739
Yeah, I thought I'd have over
200 men with me right now.

876
01:26:22,817 --> 01:26:26,218
Life's got a funny way of turning
out different, though, don't it?

877
01:26:26,287 --> 01:26:28,287
Yeah.

878
01:26:29,724 --> 01:26:32,693
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

879
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:35,228
See that railcar?

880
01:26:35,296 --> 01:26:37,491
It'll give us a better view.

881
01:26:37,565 --> 01:26:40,056
Move.

882
01:26:46,073 --> 01:26:48,371
Drop your packs - weapons only.

883
01:27:17,104 --> 01:27:19,937
Okay, we're gonna have a window -

884
01:27:20,007 --> 01:27:23,067
10, maybe 12 seconds every time he
makes a turn, and we're gonna use it.

885
01:27:23,144 --> 01:27:25,339
- How?
- We're gonna split up.

886
01:27:25,412 --> 01:27:27,676
We stay together, take
a hit, and we're gone,

887
01:27:27,748 --> 01:27:29,349
so we gotta use every angle.

888
01:27:29,350 --> 01:27:31,614
Now, Quinn, you're gonna
take that west wall.

889
01:27:31,685 --> 01:27:34,483
Don't lock and load till
you get there. You got it?

890
01:27:34,555 --> 01:27:36,555
Okay. What about you?

891
01:27:36,590 --> 01:27:38,785
I got the north.

892
01:27:38,859 --> 01:27:41,953
Alex, I need you
to stay right here.

893
01:27:42,029 --> 01:27:44,930
Now, when Quinn and I make a
move, it's gonna draw him off,

894
01:27:44,999 --> 01:27:47,263
and I don't think the
son of a bitch can count.

895
01:27:47,334 --> 01:27:50,360
Now, he's gonna make
another turn.

896
01:27:50,437 --> 01:27:52,769
When he does, I'm
gonna tell you to go.

897
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:55,568
You're gonna run like hell to that east
wall. Don't think about it...

898
01:27:55,643 --> 01:27:58,568
- It's water!
- Yeah, keep it. You're gonna need it.

899
01:28:03,117 --> 01:28:06,211
We have paid a terrible price.

900
01:28:08,422 --> 01:28:11,721
And now we got a chance
to make a difference.

901
01:28:16,730 --> 01:28:18,730
We will.

902
01:28:38,252 --> 01:28:40,053
Now, that's our first window.

903
01:28:40,054 --> 01:28:42,054
Quinn...

904
01:28:42,256 --> 01:28:44,256
Move!

905
01:29:23,762 --> 01:29:27,022
The arrows.

906
01:29:55,362 --> 01:29:57,263
Alex!

907
01:29:57,264 --> 01:30:00,199
In about 8 seconds,
we're gonna have a window!

908
01:30:02,202 --> 01:30:04,363
Now, when I tell you to go,

909
01:30:04,438 --> 01:30:09,341
you run like hell straight
to the base of this chimney!

910
01:30:09,410 --> 01:30:12,868
Are you ready?!

911
01:30:16,784 --> 01:30:19,344
Go! Go!

912
01:30:19,420 --> 01:30:21,420
No!

913
01:30:24,758 --> 01:30:27,454
Run like the wind, baby!

914
01:30:37,771 --> 01:30:39,771
Come on, big boy!

915
01:30:42,876 --> 01:30:44,876
That's right.

916
01:31:21,048 --> 01:31:23,048
Quinn!

917
01:31:23,751 --> 01:31:25,751
Alex!

918
01:31:34,261 --> 01:31:36,320
Stop!

919
01:31:47,107 --> 01:31:48,741
I'm fine.

920
01:31:48,742 --> 01:31:50,610
What are we gonna do?

921
01:31:50,611 --> 01:31:52,512
I lost the explosives.

922
01:31:52,513 --> 01:31:54,513
We're gonna find 'em.

923
01:31:59,086 --> 01:32:00,520
Keep going!

924
01:32:00,521 --> 01:32:02,455
Go around the other side!

925
01:32:02,456 --> 01:32:05,152
I'll slow him down!

926
01:32:34,288 --> 01:32:38,190
He's not moving.
He's waiting for us.

927
01:32:38,258 --> 01:32:41,591
Quinn... by the truck -
the arrow.

928
01:32:41,662 --> 01:32:44,256
By the wheel.

929
01:33:11,325 --> 01:33:13,325
No!

930
01:33:17,931 --> 01:33:19,931
Die!

931
01:34:28,569 --> 01:34:32,596
He always thought you could do it.

932
01:34:32,673 --> 01:34:36,473
And you did.

933
01:34:41,181 --> 01:34:44,673
Come on.

934
01:35:21,054 --> 01:35:24,820
Quinn! Quinn! Quinn!

935
01:35:24,891 --> 01:35:27,052
We got a signal!
Quinn!

936
01:35:27,127 --> 01:35:29,127
We got a signal.

937
01:35:31,198 --> 01:35:32,965
Well, what's the problem?

938
01:35:32,966 --> 01:35:35,025
They're speaking French.

939
01:35:35,135 --> 01:35:37,729
Well, don't come to
me. I'm lousy at French.

940
01:35:37,804 --> 01:35:39,829
They want to speak
to the person in charge.

941
01:35:39,906 --> 01:35:41,574
Ah...

942
01:35:41,575 --> 01:35:43,575
Well, that would be you, then.

943
01:35:43,577 --> 01:35:45,841
Just keep 'em talking.

944
01:35:47,914 --> 01:35:50,712
Get us a good bottle
of wine or something.

945
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:52,285
Go on, now.

946
01:35:52,286 --> 01:35:54,286
Thanks, Quinn.

947
01:35:55,622 --> 01:35:57,681
Go on, all of you.

948
01:35:57,758 --> 01:36:01,194
- All right. Cheers.
- Well done!

949
01:36:01,261 --> 01:36:04,856
You think it'll last?

950
01:36:04,931 --> 01:36:06,866
I don't know.

951
01:36:06,867 --> 01:36:09,335
It's been, what, three months

952
01:36:09,403 --> 01:36:11,564
since we saw the last one?

953
01:36:11,638 --> 01:36:15,972
If they come, they'll
burn, we'll build.

954
01:36:16,043 --> 01:36:18,978
Or maybe I'll just kill 'em.

955
01:36:19,046 --> 01:36:20,446
And here I thought

956
01:36:20,447 --> 01:36:22,915
optimism was against
your nature.

957
01:36:22,983 --> 01:36:25,315
It's a recent development.

958
01:36:29,790 --> 01:36:32,122
Well, here's to evolution.

980
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:36,117
