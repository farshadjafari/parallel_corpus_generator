00:00:32,122 --> 00:00:33,555

is made by Chef Auguste Gusteau.

Idiot! I knew this would happen!

531
00:33:17,653 --> 00:33:20,451
I let a rat into my place
and tell him what's mine is his!

Eggs, gone!

00:33:21,789 --> 00:33:25,191
Stupid! He's stolen food
and hit the road! What did I expect?

Mmm!

538
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:44,939
That's good. What did you put in this?

539
00:33:47,015 --> 00:33:48,505
Where'd you get that?

540
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:56,419
Look, it's delicious. But don't steal.
I'll buy some spices, okay?

Oh, no. We're going to be late.

any biting, or nipping,

no heir appears,

676
00:42:52,422 --> 00:42:56,722
Gusteau's business interests
will pass to his sous chef. You.

There's not much resemblance.

There's no resemblance at all.
He is not Gusteau's son.

681
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:17,273
Gusteau had no children,
and what of the timing of all this?

682
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:20,646
The deadline in the will
expires in less than a month!

683
00:43:20,817 --> 00:43:22,909
Suddenly,
some boy arrives with a letter

684
00:43:23,019 --> 00:43:27,980
from his recently deceased mother
claiming Gusteau is his father?

Highly suspect!

00:43:29,659 --> 00:43:31,525
- This is Gusteau's?
- Yes, yes, yes.

00:43:31,628 --> 00:43:33,219
- May I?
- Of course.

688
00:43:33,329 --> 00:43:34,797
But the boy does not know.

689
00:43:34,898 --> 00:43:39,231
She claims she never told him,
or Gusteau, and asks that I not tell.

690
00:43:39,335 --> 00:43:43,329
- Why you? What does she want?
- A job for the boy.

691
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,340
- Only a job?
- Well, yes.

692
00:43:46,443 --> 00:43:48,967
Then what are you worried about?
If he works here,

693
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:52,014
you'll be able to keep an eye on him
while I do a little digging.

694

to collect some DNA samples

I don't really drink, you know.

872
00:52:31,568 --> 00:52:35,664
Of course you don't.
I wouldn't either if I was drinking that.

00:52:35,771 --> 00:52:39,969

of elephantine proportions

00:53:55,418 --> 00:53:59,684
- And he can. It's for my brother.
- But the boy could lose his job.

00:53:59,789 --> 00:54:02,952
Which means I would, too.
It's under control, okay?

893

- More wine?
- I shouldn't, but... Okay.

894
00:54:08,197 --> 00:54:11,530
So, where did you train, Linguini?

895
00:54:11,634 --> 00:54:13,931
Train? All right.

896
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:18,664

this is your first time cooking?

- I knew it!

- Now, try them together.

Okay.

00:55:36,385 --> 00:55:39,844
I think I'm getting
a little something there.

- It might be the nuttiness.
- See?

- Could be the tang.
- That's it.

- No.

at some point?

- Hey! Why do they call it that?
- What?

948
00:56:34,376 --> 00:56:38,472
Ratatouille. It's like a stew, right?
Why do they call it that?

If you're going to name a food,

950
00:56:40,248 --> 00:56:43,184
you should give it a name
that sounds delicious.

951
00:56:43,318 --> 00:56:48,552
Ratatouille doesn't sound delicious.
It sounds like "rat" and "patootie."

is that you're home.

- I can take care of myself.

so I'll be able to visit often.

to make you...

- Visit?
- I will. I promise. Often.

969
00:58:17,679 --> 00:58:22,617
- You're not staying?
- No. It's not a big deal, Dad. I just...

I was going to stay forever, did you?

- Perspective. Fresh out, I take it?

(MUFFLED GROANING)

1542
01:37:20,787 --> 01:37:22,413
I can't remember the last time

1543
01:37:22,521 --> 01:37:25,820
I asked a waiter
to give my compliments to the chef.

1544
01:37:26,792 --> 01:37:29,591
And now I find myself
in the extraordinary position

1545
01:37:29,695 --> 01:37:31,788
of having my waiter be the chef.

1546
01:37:31,998 --> 01:37:34,934
Thanks, but I'm just your waiter tonight.

1547
01:37:36,002 --> 01:37:38,470
Then who do I thank for the meal?

1548
01:37:39,338 --> 01:37:41,033
Excuse me a minute.

1549
01:37:45,412 --> 01:37:47,106
(MUFFLED ARGUING)

1550
01:37:52,051 --> 01:37:53,041
You must be the chef...

1551
01:37:53,153 --> 01:37:55,279
If you wish to meet the chef,
you will have to wait

1552
01:37:55,389 --> 01:37:57,448
until all the other customer have gone.

1553
01:37:59,493 --> 01:38:00,653
So be it.

1554
01:38:22,349 --> 01:38:24,873
REMY: At first, Ego thinks it's a joke.

1555
01:38:25,085 --> 01:38:31,024
But as Linguini explains,
Ego's smile disappears.

1556
01:38:31,158 --> 01:38:32,625
(RATS SQUEAKING)

1557
01:38:36,630 --> 01:38:40,690
He doesn't react
beyond asking an occasional question.

1558
01:38:41,234 --> 01:38:45,603
And when the story is done,
Ego stands, thanks us for the meal...

1559
01:38:45,706 --> 01:38:47,367
Thank you for the meal.

1560
01:38:47,474 --> 01:38:50,341
...and leaves without another word.

1561
01:38:52,612 --> 01:38:56,547
The following day his review appears.

1562
01:38:59,086 --> 01:39:03,181
E GO: In many ways,
the work of a critic is easy.

1563
01:39:03,390 --> 01:39:07,622
We risk very little,
yet enjoy a position over those

1564
01:39:07,728 --> 01:39:11,788
who offer up their work
and their selves to our judgment.

1565
01:39:12,032 --> 01:39:17,402
We thrive on negative criticism,
which is fun to write and to read.

1566
01:39:17,938 --> 01:39:24,467
But the bitter truth we critics must face
is that in the grand scheme of things,

1567
01:39:24,578 --> 01:39:28,570
the average piece of junk
is probably more meaningful

1568
01:39:28,681 --> 01:39:31,947
than our criticism designating it so.

1569
01:39:32,319 --> 01:39:36,448
But there are times
when a critic truly risks something

1570
01:39:36,555 --> 01:39:40,855
and that is in the discovery
and defense of the new.

1571
01:39:40,961 --> 01:39:45,556
The world is often unkind
to new talent, new creations.

1572
01:39:45,765 --> 01:39:48,234
The new needs friends.

1573
01:39:48,534 --> 01:39:52,061
Last night,
I experienced something new,

1574
01:39:52,271 --> 01:39:57,231
an extraordinary meal
from a singularly unexpected source.

1575
01:39:57,444 --> 01:40:00,072
To say that both the meal
and its maker

1576
01:40:00,180 --> 01:40:03,671
have challenged my preconceptions
about fine cooking

1577
01:40:03,783 --> 01:40:06,479
is a gross understatement.

1578
01:40:06,886 --> 01:40:10,083
They have rocked me to my core.

1579
01:40:10,823 --> 01:40:14,282
In the past, I have made no secret
of my disdain

1580
01:40:14,394 --> 01:40:19,354
for Chef Gusteau's famous motto,
"Anyone can cook."

1581
01:40:19,666 --> 01:40:25,865
But I realize only now
do I truly understand what he meant.

1582
01:40:26,172 --> 01:40:30,109
Not everyone
can become a great artist,

1583
01:40:30,210 --> 01:40:34,543
but a great artist
can come from anywhere.

1584
01:40:35,148 --> 01:40:38,412
It is difficult to imagine
more humble origins

1585
01:40:38,518 --> 01:40:42,386
than those of the genius
now cooking at Gusteau's,

1586
01:40:42,488 --> 01:40:45,322
who is, in this critic's opinion,

1587
01:40:45,425 --> 01:40:49,657
nothing less
than the finest chef in France.

1588
01:40:49,863 --> 01:40:51,730
I will be returning to Gusteau's soon,
hungry for more.

1589
01:40:51,730 --> 01:40:55,189
I will be returning to Gusteau's soon,
hungry for more.

(CHUCKLIN G) The happiest of my life.

1592
01:40:59,038 --> 01:41:03,567
But the only thing predictable
about life is its unpredictability.

1593
01:41:03,676 --> 01:41:06,840
Well, we had to let Skinner
and the health inspector loose,

1594
01:41:06,947 --> 01:41:09,346
and of course they ratted us out.

1595
01:41:09,716 --> 01:41:11,342
The food didn't matter.

1596
01:41:11,451 --> 01:41:13,817
Once it got out
there were rats in the kitchen,

1597
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:15,979
oh, man, the restaurant was closed

1598
01:41:16,088 --> 01:41:18,819
and Ego lost his job and his credibility.

1599
01:41:18,925 --> 01:41:20,859
But don't feel too bad for him.

1600
01:41:20,961 --> 01:41:24,453
He's doing very well
as a small business investor.

1601

gets better when I tell it, okay?
