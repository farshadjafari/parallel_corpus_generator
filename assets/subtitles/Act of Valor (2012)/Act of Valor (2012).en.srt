You know I don't surf.

55
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:11,190
I know you don't surf, but it'll good to get families together.

56
00:06:11,318 --> 00:06:15,262
But now that you've told everyone in the bar, trying to contained yourself tomorrow

57
00:06:15,982 --> 00:06:17,066
I will try.

63
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,482
How you guys doing, huh?

64
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:53,882
Christo!

65
00:07:38,568 --> 00:07:40,951
Hey, I'll be right down, all right?

66
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,851
Whatever you say, Boss.

67
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,478
How was arrive?

68
00:07:47,478 --> 00:07:49,146
I left Colombia this morning

69
00:07:49,794 --> 00:07:51,355
Colombia to here in a day?

70
00:07:51,646 --> 00:07:52,794
It's a gag

71
00:07:54,051 --> 00:07:56,651
Anyway, estimate says that Christo worth close to a million

72
00:07:56,711 --> 00:07:57,843
That's he would be?

73
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:04,546
Yeah, and he gives back a lot to this community over here with medical clinics, schools, political donations, you name it 

74
00:08:04,827 --> 00:08:07,600
So this is the deal, they are extremely loyal to him over here.

75
00:08:08,338 --> 00:08:10,122
When did the DEA have a <i>mobile dwarf</i>? 

76
00:08:10,362 --> 00:08:13,902
When they intercepted a 707 of his field with Soviet weapons

77
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,266
This is among us. These boys overheard NSA, 

78
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:22,266
they found some interesting hints connecting Christo toward Jihadist network out this South East Asia

79
00:08:22,762 --> 00:08:26,618
Apparently, Christo one of the guys running the network. They're childhood friends

00:08:31,647 --> 00:08:36,602
<i>Your father's grandfather gave up his life piloting a B-24 on World War II</i>

<i>That's the blood that courses through your veins</i>

84
00:08:45,462 --> 00:08:47,778
Daddy, can I come with you?

85
00:08:47,814 --> 00:08:50,634
Wanna come with me? Did you  feel how cold it is out there?

86
00:08:50,634 --> 00:08:54,585
I tell you what, go hang out with mommy for a little while, help out with the baby

87
00:08:54,585 --> 00:08:57,666
when I came back in, if you still wanna go out. I'll take you out with me.

88
00:08:57,789 --> 00:08:58,835
Promise?

89
00:08:59,035 --> 00:09:00,258
I promise. Hurry up, go.

90
00:09:06,534 --> 00:09:08,546

- What's up, Brother?

91
00:09:09,034 --> 00:09:10,250

00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:14,863
Oh, I know you got the New York heritage, but this isn't exactly like sitting back on Santa Island

93
00:09:14,883 --> 00:09:16,498

96
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,314
Hey, wait until you have 5 kids,  man.
Let's see how much time you got playing the surf.

look at this, 38 points for me

113
00:10:38,056 --> 00:10:40,071
ADUMBRATING?
That's even not a word.

114
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:45,003
Ok, first of all, it's pronounced "atombrading" and it means
"pretending" , " foreshadowing"

115
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:50,293
Hmm.. 
guess who's buying dinner tonight. Sugar?

- Yeah

Hey, Senior. 
Do you mind to give us a scope for the ashburn?

00:13:38,126 --> 00:13:40,126
No, I might got that thing.

Hey fellas, you know how will I got so many speeches and give in work-up for the deployment, but uh...

146
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,899
It's like Chief and I said, right at the beginning of this platoon

147
00:13:52,376 --> 00:13:57,847
Once we step off on campaign, once it reversed ready for downranged, everything back home is be unbalanced

148
00:13:58,327 --> 00:14:02,459
we will not worth the dead of each other or self, we get over there, something out of recommendative 

149
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:08,075
Things aren't right with the family, things aren't right with the finance or something's off. It's gonna put us all out of balance. So..

150
00:14:08,075 --> 00:14:10,267
we need to had that typed before we launch.

151
00:14:10,408 --> 00:14:12,050
Have somebody got an issue, bring it on

152
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,795
Chief can take care, I can take care. Everybody's got each other's back.

153
00:14:14,991 --> 00:14:19,651
Let's make sure we lock that down, when we ride or roll. All our focus is on the mission.

154
00:14:22,091 --> 00:14:29,651
For all those been downranged, to us and those like us, damn few. Cheers!

so why don't you save us both  some time

and tell me exactly what you think you know.

185
00:16:55,075 --> 00:17:00,195
I take care the mothers 
who give birth to your kind.

186
00:17:05,323 --> 00:17:10,935
How does that feel Miss Morales?
Have a great day at the Spa.

187
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,036
Turn off the speaker!

189

Yes Boss

190
00:17:34,948 --> 00:17:36,219

Hey fellas, what's up?

193
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:52,208
It's hard when two rats screwed 
and we all suck up, didn't ya?

194
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:55,916
Africa had Tarzan. Can take a seat.  
Anyway, here's the deal.

195
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,288

197
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,552
Three days ago two CIA agents, Walter Ross

198
00:18:01,552 --> 00:18:03,649
and Miss Lisa Morales were ambushed

199
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:04,861
inside their hotel room here in Costa Rica

200
00:18:04,861 --> 00:18:07,912
by eh..  unknown amount of  heavily armed assholes

201
00:18:07,912 --> 00:18:10,248
Unfortunately, Mr. Ross was murdered,
and Ms. Morales

202
00:18:10,248 --> 00:18:12,304
has been abducted.
We believe that

203
00:18:12,304 --> 00:18:15,516
this is been a work of a guy named Mikhail Troykovich

204
00:18:15,516 --> 00:18:18,874
A.K.A Christo. LT's going to give you the scanning on him

205
00:18:18,886 --> 00:18:22,299
Thanks Senior.
Mikhail Troykovich A.K.A Christo

206
00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:24,729
This guy's believed has been working

207
00:18:24,749 --> 00:18:27,029
cocaine from weapon deals between the Russian mafia, 

208
00:18:27,405 --> 00:18:27,947
the FARC guerrillas

209
00:18:27,947 --> 00:18:31,291
and the Mexican drugs cartels eversince the late 1990's

210
00:18:31,476 --> 00:18:36,387
Now, before she was captured, 
Morales was working on a possible link between our boy Christo

211
00:18:36,627 --> 00:18:38,179
and this guy, Abu Shabal

212
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:44,787
Glory to Allah, Lord of the world, that has created us as Muslims and delivered us with jihad

213
00:18:45,067 --> 00:18:46,924
on His direct Path

214
00:18:47,132 --> 00:18:50,255
Peace be upon those, who's on His direct Path in the Day of Judgement.

215
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:54,548
on this explanation to you,

216
00:18:54,939 --> 00:18:58,932
we are not separatists. 
We're setting on all legal part of anyone

217
00:18:58,964 --> 00:19:02,727
be you an agent are wilingly or unwillingly

218
00:19:02,727 --> 00:19:05,228
assisting the agenda of genocide

219
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:06,354
of our people,

220
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:08,428
by demanding that we obey certain rules

221
00:19:08,676 --> 00:19:12,516
and by your continous occupation of all Muslim countries,

222
00:19:12,516 --> 00:19:17,404
With the Grace of Allah, we must exile to this heed

223
00:19:17,404 --> 00:19:24,912
America, you'll never be safe, until safety becomes a reality for us.
Allahu Akbar.

224
00:19:25,804 --> 00:19:30,132
Abu shabal is a Chechen terrorist that
associated with the Beslan school massacre

225
00:19:30,132 --> 00:19:34,228
He's been jumping between training camps in Indonesia
and the Philippines

226
00:19:34,228 --> 00:19:35,996
Now, the connection between Christo

227
00:19:35,996 --> 00:19:38,197
and Abbu Shabal is so a little bit fuzzy,

228
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:40,571
But if this was the lead that Morales was working on

229
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:43,300
it could be why she was abducted.
Senior?

230
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,996
All right, this is a personal recovery

231
00:19:45,996 --> 00:19:48,920
of Miss Morales.
All right, who's got questions?

232
00:19:49,244 --> 00:19:52,795
See, Chief. If you have any  update resource, and tell us numbers inside the 

233
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:54,422
camp, what about roving patrols? 

234
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,731
Maybe 8 to 10 Bro 

235
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,508
but we don't know anything about roving patrols

236
00:19:57,508 --> 00:20:01,708
you just gonna have to assume that's all working around the squared away you just did for a living too

237
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:04,021
Senior, what kind of weapons on target are we looking at?

238
00:20:04,021 --> 00:20:08,021
Heavy weapons. This guys are narco traffickers,
so they can have anything from  Soviet block discus.

239
00:20:08,021 --> 00:20:12,541
They can have a empty UHB for the course out there,
we don't know.

240
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:15,371
So, if there is a weapons in place out there, I suggest you guys bring rockets

241
00:20:15,371 --> 00:20:19,849
of course rockets and bullets don't match,
so make sure you got a clear shot.

242
00:20:20,137 --> 00:20:22,293
Any idea wether she's ambulatory or not?

243
00:20:22,393 --> 00:20:24,551
There's ton of blood on the scene, 

244
00:20:24,551 --> 00:20:26,110
and alot of it was Mr Ross'

245
00:20:26,502 --> 00:20:28,278
We confirmed that Ms. Morales may has blood there too

246
00:20:28,278 --> 00:20:30,118
But these guys are savages.

247
00:20:30,118 --> 00:20:31,614
So, you're gonna have to assume that she is..

248
00:20:31,614 --> 00:20:34,586
non ambulatory, so you gonna have to bring stuff to carry her out.

249
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:40,186
<i>Two minutes to drop</i>

250
00:20:52,898 --> 00:20:59,538
Hey LT, got this little know who that guy,
so we get back we can kick his ass!

251
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:01,090

252

Let's go, let's go!

344
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:09,255
Right turn, right turn!

345
00:36:17,602 --> 00:36:20,054
Hey man, we're not gonna make this secondary extract

346
00:36:20,054 --> 00:36:22,306
I gotta find us around employing this road..
Left, left, left! 

347
00:36:24,372 --> 00:36:26,286
Mikey, come on buddy

348
00:36:27,383 --> 00:36:28,836
Hey Chief!

00:36:30,383 --> 00:36:32,836
we're not gonna make secondary extract!

350
00:36:32,919 --> 00:36:35,912
- You're not to figure it out man!

351
00:36:36,272 --> 00:36:38,786
Come on, stay with me, stay with me!

352
00:36:39,872 --> 00:36:44,386
Stay with me, come on Mike!

353
00:36:50,903 --> 00:36:52,828
Help Team, we can make it to rally point

354
00:36:53,243 --> 00:36:55,298
Sounds good, pass it to LT!

355
00:36:57,772 --> 00:37:04,286
LT, LT, this is Assault Team.
We just lost secondary extract, I say it again

356
00:37:04,286 --> 00:37:06,130
Move it to rally point, L copy, over.

357
00:37:09,306 --> 00:37:10,842
- What about the <i>click hour</i>?
  

358
00:37:20,922 --> 00:37:25,181
Mike, wake up!
Come on Mike, come on Mikey, wake up!

359
00:37:38,306 --> 00:37:40,342
- Got it? 
- Axis clear!

360
00:37:40,774 --> 00:37:41,117

00:38:10,479 --> 00:38:12,875
Sir, what's the status on those boat?

366
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:17,282
I lost Whiplash on the run.
Told you to hit the target early, they're coming in hot

367
00:38:17,282 --> 00:38:18,582
Roger that.

368
00:38:20,634 --> 00:38:23,582

Holy shit!

371
00:38:34,634 --> 00:38:35,082
Break it up, break it up!

372
00:39:00,342 --> 00:39:04,693
Ajay, do it allright, they're coming at our rear!

373
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:12,922
<i>Whiplash, Whiplash!
Deck at the air extraction first</i>

374
00:39:12,922 --> 00:39:16,655
<i>Moving to tertiary extract. 
I have 8 packs</i>

375
00:39:16,655 --> 00:39:19,971
<i>7 is around, 1 package. 
Package is wounded Morales</i>

376
00:39:20,034 --> 00:39:23,582
<i>"The Sierra" has downtown one to the head.
This will be a hard extract.</i>

377
00:39:30,539 --> 00:39:37,603
- What the fcuk?!
- sit down, man. Get down!

378
00:39:37,634 --> 00:39:38,582
Mikey's up man, Mikey's up.
331

379
00:40:02,892 --> 00:40:05,252
- Mikey, hang on Buddy.
- Where are we?

380
00:40:05,252 --> 00:40:08,380
On our way to extract. We're good to go

381
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:13,292
- You took one tho the face man, you harm another fcuker.
- Do we get it? / Yes, 

382
00:40:13,292 --> 00:40:14,582
Ajay, splash it, splash it!

383
00:40:15,436 --> 00:40:17,864
Water!
water, water!

384
00:40:25,575 --> 00:40:26,398
I got her, I got her!

385
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:25,243
<i>It wasn't for nothing</i>

386
00:43:11,554 --> 00:43:14,010
UKRAINE

387
00:43:33,306 --> 00:43:34,818
Who are you?

388
00:43:56,554 --> 00:44:03,810
- Is it Mendelsson?
- No, Brahms.

389
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:10,162
I am Kerimov.
You must be Shabal.

390
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:17,162
Ok, as I said to Christo on the phone, I have the requirement you want

391
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:20,162
a vest

392
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:27,550
- Cool isn't it?
- It is simple but effective

393
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,162
over here

394
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:34,162
Inside them is tiny balls made of
ceramics-based.

395
00:44:34,499 --> 00:44:37,162
Five hundred of them
woven into vest,

396
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:41,162
They contain explosive gel

397
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:45,162
It is our new technology 

398
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:49,162
It is truly devastating,

399
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:51,162
please

400
00:44:56,850 --> 00:44:58,562
Here is no big deal, you know this

401
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:03,162
It is designed for open spaces

402
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:06,162
You have to believe me

403
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:13,162
There are few weapons in the world that they can operated only by one man

404
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:17,162
Look at this.

405
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:18,170
</font> <font color="#00ffff">presented to you by: kucing_gaul (Nakashima_Tadayoshi)</font>

406
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:28,162
They can go everywhere without get detected

407
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:33,162
You could take tour to White House or wherever you like

408
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:37,162
Can I see a demonstration?

409
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:42,162
You kidding, you even have no time to go to Siberia

410
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:47,162
Listen, when this explodes, there is no safe place.

411
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:54,162
Imagine firing 500 bullets everywhere and being scattered by a massive explosion.
345

412
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:13,162
and create such a massal panic through American mass media.
A total collapse of economy will happened.

413
00:46:23,396 --> 00:46:30,316
Buddy, look, you're never change

414
00:46:30,332 --> 00:46:33,491
- Can I take his coat?
- No, thank you 

415
00:46:36,123 --> 00:46:39,776
And now from time to time, I get to see my old friends by my old life.

416
00:46:42,208 --> 00:46:45,180
And it's always, always disappointing.

417
00:46:47,156 --> 00:46:49,699
Some become asshole, as other boring

418
00:46:49,699 --> 00:46:53,363
And I can't believe I tried to get them in bed all those years ago

419
00:46:56,396 --> 00:47:02,107
Hey, it is nice not to be disappointed Yuri

420
00:47:05,107 --> 00:47:07,267
It's not my name

421
00:47:07,267 --> 00:47:11,903
I know. Muhammad Abu Shabal, the son of Shabal

422
00:47:11,903 --> 00:47:15,676
Come on, your father's name is Yevgeny

423
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:21,892
- It's changed.
- Yeah, I think it's changed

424
00:47:21,892 --> 00:47:24,915
That's why this is the last time I might have to see each other for quite some time. 

425
00:47:24,915 --> 00:47:29,915
 For am I have to find a hole to hide in.

426
00:47:30,276 --> 00:47:32,380
I don't understand

427
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:38,148
I'm being watched by the CIA, and not there gonna be any chances

428
00:47:38,148 --> 00:47:39,888
This is the most oppotunities present itself

429
00:47:39,888 --> 00:47:42,020
I'm taking my family South. I need the help, the energy,

430
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:43,863
or the will to fight the Americans

431
00:47:43,863 --> 00:47:47,739
What about Ardile and Michel, and they have been in training

432
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:51,140
for almost a year now, I have devoted much of my respect..

433
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:53,400
The deal stands, Yuri.
Just because I've taken early retirement,  

434
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:57,285
does not mean I'm not holding at my end into the bargain

435
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:57,285
<font color="#ffff01">There is so much to be done.</font>

436
00:47:57,518 --> 00:47:59,246
And it will be, just without me!

437
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:02,258
You have to use my trust in associates

438
00:48:02,621 --> 00:48:04,186
- It's not so good for me!
- Hey!

439
00:48:04,186 --> 00:48:11,890
Hey, shut up! Shut up! Stop! You're fcuking bullshit!
It's not good, it doesn't work 

440
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:14,430
- You can't change it like that!
- Nothing changes, nothing.

441
00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:17,239
You just told me everything change, but what is it?
What is that?

442
00:48:17,239 --> 00:48:22,528
Do you know, what I do to get here?
Do you know, the man why has to sacrifice to get here?

443
00:48:22,528 --> 00:48:24,239
Do you have any idea?

444
00:48:24,736 --> 00:48:28,344
No, you shit, you live up here, this ivory tower, you know I don't care.

445
00:48:40,431 --> 00:48:45,359
USS BON HOMME RICHARD - CENTRAL AMERICAN COAST

446
00:48:47,431 --> 00:48:53,359
- Hey Chief, what's the status of Mikey? 
- He's definitely lose the eye, but he's hang it tough.

447
00:48:56,252 --> 00:48:57,828
Yeah, I'm gonna get read into this

448
00:48:57,828 --> 00:49:00,543
Great job, small check in those assholes, get Morales back

449
00:49:00,543 --> 00:49:03,595
It's a blunt deal for Mikey better get to tell you what was the solid work.

450
00:49:03,595 --> 00:49:06,715
- So Chief, make sure you get that down of the boys right away. Do you hear me?
- Sure

451
00:49:06,715 --> 00:49:09,162
All right. 
And Morales.

452
00:49:09,162 --> 00:49:10,987
Morales was one tough chick. 

453
00:49:10,987 --> 00:49:15,603
But she should've got in this stuff up to change a lot faster because this thing is way bigger than we thought it was.

454
00:49:15,603 --> 00:49:19,135
How was that?
I thought this was cut and dry arm search recovery

455
00:49:19,135 --> 00:49:20,590
Yeah, wasn't until we got into that phone 

456
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,646
that you guys picked up at that shit hole.

457
00:49:23,166 --> 00:49:26,408
- It turn me out of something just not look right at all.
- And what's not right about it?

458
00:49:26,408 --> 00:49:29,419
Christo and Shabal are a lot closer than I thought they were. 

459
00:49:29,419 --> 00:49:31,627
Shabal is a wild core man

460
00:49:31,627 --> 00:49:35,356
He's an old jahadi, that couldn't give a rest-ass about money or drugs.

461
00:49:35,356 --> 00:49:37,652
Yeah, that tells his friend Christo, the dope dealer?

462
00:49:37,652 --> 00:49:39,772
He's not a dealer man,

463
00:49:39,772 --> 00:49:41,156
he's a smugler.

464
00:49:42,068 --> 00:49:43,292
You've gotta be kidding me.

465
00:49:43,292 --> 00:49:49,792
that is exactly what I'm thingking.
Shabal wants to kill Americans, Christo knows how to get fcukers inside America.

466
00:49:49,792 --> 00:49:55,292
This could be big trouble in little timing fellas.
They're gonna hit us at home.

467
00:49:55,292 --> 00:50:00,292
I just got done talking to boss, on the spec of task force, this is gonna go down.

468
00:50:00,292 --> 00:50:05,292
I need Ajay and Ray stand by to launch for NSR in 2 hours. They gonna get some friggin' flower mouse on the way to Africa.

469
00:50:05,292 --> 00:50:06,614
Why Africa?

470
00:50:06,614 --> 00:50:09,114
We pended airfield there by the phone that you got?

471
00:50:09,114 --> 00:50:12,614
And I think that Shabal is gonna be there during weapon transfer on his way West.

472
00:50:12,614 --> 00:50:14,614
When you say "West", what do we talking about?

473
00:50:14,614 --> 00:50:15,962
Mexico West?

474
00:50:15,962 --> 00:50:16,945
Yeah

475
00:50:16,945 --> 00:50:18,058
Mexico West

476
00:50:18,452 --> 00:50:20,306
It's the worst case scenario

477
00:50:20,306 --> 00:50:22,549
You two and the rest of platoon are gonna stay here

478
00:50:22,549 --> 00:50:26,305
and  standby, you'll be the primary assault for worst case that goes down anywhere near America

479
00:50:26,521 --> 00:50:27,006
Check

480
00:50:27,106 --> 00:50:27,506
Check

481
00:50:27,928 --> 00:50:30,247
You gonna be around for any questions as they came up? 

482
00:50:30,247 --> 00:50:34,820
No man. Christo, he put a <i>Roman Polanski</i> at my ass and disappeared.

483
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:37,075
So I'm gonna link up for SEAL Team 4

484
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:39,434
and we're gonna go hunt his ass down in the South Pacific

485
00:50:39,434 --> 00:50:41,924
So straight up, my ties and palm trees so maybe...

486
00:50:41,924 --> 00:50:43,308
Yeah brother, I go get them

487
00:50:43,308 --> 00:50:44,475
Be cool. take it easy

488
00:50:44,475 --> 00:50:46,573
Good luck with that baby, Lieutenant

489
00:50:48,192 --> 00:50:49,115
Does everybody know?

490
00:50:49,859 --> 00:50:51,326
All the important people

491
00:50:51,326 --> 00:50:52,649
The important people to who?

492
00:50:52,649 --> 00:50:53,487
For you?

493
00:50:53,655 --> 00:50:54,255
I guess so

494
00:50:56,393 --> 00:50:58,036
I'm gonna go brood the boys

495
00:50:58,036 --> 00:50:59,257
Hey hold on one second

496
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:03,356
I brought it here cause I want you to read it before

497
00:51:04,006 --> 00:51:05,201
I'm trusted officer...

498
00:51:05,307 --> 00:51:07,950
and but to be honest with you

499
00:51:08,826 --> 00:51:10,597
I was thinking to calling the commander

500
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:12,124
trying to get you home

501
00:51:12,368 --> 00:51:14,406
And now worse picked up so much

502
00:51:14,874 --> 00:51:17,112
I feel like we really need you here

503
00:51:17,883 --> 00:51:19,934
You remember our last cruise on Alamar?

504
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:20,679
Yeah

505
00:51:21,145 --> 00:51:24,256
When you got that final turn over op you said I don't need to be there

506
00:51:24,408 --> 00:51:27,684
I was lying in bed, and I realized all the thing I need do now was go home

507
00:51:28,154 --> 00:51:30,839
But if something went south in your op

508
00:51:30,839 --> 00:51:33,043
I would always regret not being there with you

509
00:51:33,043 --> 00:51:35,796
I appreciate you're taking care of me big time, Dave

510
00:51:35,796 --> 00:51:37,866
But I'm working sometimes with the brass

511
00:51:37,866 --> 00:51:39,266
If I can 

512
00:51:39,266 --> 00:51:40,207
And things slow down

513
00:51:40,207 --> 00:51:41,872
I'm gonna get 2 weeks off

514
00:51:41,872 --> 00:51:44,132
I'll leave the works now eitherway, 

515
00:51:44,132 --> 00:51:44,995
I really do

516
00:51:44,995 --> 00:51:45,759
But if it doesn't

517
00:51:46,852 --> 00:51:51,899
I'm gonna take this piece of paper and I'll make it into nice paper airplane

518
00:51:52,176 --> 00:51:53,035
Bid it

519
00:52:15,193 --> 00:52:16,652
AFRICAN COAST

520
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:48,778
Good, we're good

521
00:52:58,131 --> 00:53:02,488
- 601, emerge the ship at 160 feet
- guide, guide

522
00:53:28,136 --> 00:53:30,564
Hey guys thank you for being here so fast

523
00:53:30,564 --> 00:53:31,454
Grab a seat, please

524
00:53:31,454 --> 00:53:32,287
Thank you

525
00:53:32,323 --> 00:53:34,072
You have Bulldog overhead

526
00:53:34,072 --> 00:53:36,299
We need you te get in, grab the intel

527
00:53:36,299 --> 00:53:37,857
and down to back to us

528
00:53:37,857 --> 00:53:39,563
Do you have any questions?

529
00:53:39,563 --> 00:53:40,228
Sir, I have a question

530
00:53:40,228 --> 00:53:42,875
We have the rally point time

531
00:53:42,875 --> 00:53:44,393
What if the meeting doesn't take place as schedule

532
00:53:44,393 --> 00:53:46,532
How long do you want us to stay on target?

533
00:53:46,532 --> 00:53:47,703
That's one counts

534
00:53:47,703 --> 00:53:50,668
So, I plan on B out there for awhile

535
00:53:50,668 --> 00:53:51,951
Check

536
00:53:51,951 --> 00:53:52,950
Are we good?

537
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:54,023
Think so Sir. Yes Sir.

538
00:54:04,597 --> 00:54:10,667
-Ray - Ajay, I'll reached up and ready to check each other out
- Grab the door, clear.

539
00:54:56,597 --> 00:54:59,667
SOMALIA

540
00:55:26,931 --> 00:55:28,458
Do we have visual?

541
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:29,746
Yeah

542
00:55:29,746 --> 00:55:30,746
Got three trucks moving in

543
00:55:30,746 --> 00:55:34,249
a fuel truck, 2 jeeps,
Some skinnies in the back

544
00:55:34,249 --> 00:55:37,055
One at the last fifty count

545
00:55:47,398 --> 00:55:48,046
Do you hear that?

546
00:55:48,046 --> 00:55:49,508
Yeah, think that our plan

547
00:55:49,508 --> 00:55:50,588
Yeah, we get some inbound

548
00:56:00,956 --> 00:56:03,709
About time he's gonna showed up, Jesus!

549
00:56:03,709 --> 00:56:05,441
Give me my camera

550
00:56:21,674 --> 00:56:24,679
Hey Ray, we got two birds down here in the field

551
00:56:24,679 --> 00:56:26,135
It's obvious our pass

552
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:28,920
No tail ID's

553
00:56:29,617 --> 00:56:30,987
You got that?

554
00:56:30,999 --> 00:56:33,042
check,  no tail IDs

555
00:56:42,197 --> 00:56:45,052
Ray, last time I checked
you were in Africa, right?

556
00:56:45,209 --> 00:56:46,216
Yeah

557
00:56:46,216 --> 00:56:46,979
Why, what's up?

558
00:56:48,207 --> 00:56:52,110
Dude, these like 16 Filipinos down there

559
00:56:52,110 --> 00:56:53,342
all praying to Mecca right now

560
00:56:53,399 --> 00:56:54,357
Filipinos?

561
00:56:54,357 --> 00:56:56,246
Filipinos definitely not skinnies

562
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,624
Who pick up the praying?

563
00:56:57,624 --> 00:56:59,692
unless he's picking up some Russian
505

564
00:57:01,223 --> 00:57:04,394
Be very careful with
these boxes, do you hear me?

565
00:57:04,394 --> 00:57:08,192
Drop one of these and
you are all going to heaven

566
00:57:10,477 --> 00:57:12,465
Aircraft will change

567
00:57:13,922 --> 00:57:16,794
And enter through two
different border crossings

568
00:57:16,794 --> 00:57:17,867
be careful

569
00:57:19,368 --> 00:57:24,064
Once on the island, your men will
have time to finish preparations

570
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:26,775
A friend will be
with you on the plane

571
00:57:26,927 --> 00:57:29,402
and help the rest of the way

572
00:57:30,835 --> 00:57:31,948
Bulldog, Bulldog

573
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:33,642

580
00:57:55,004 --> 00:58:00,085
One of the planes Ray and Ajay tagged, just
landed on Cedros Island of  the coast of Mexico

581
00:58:00,085 --> 00:58:02,808
It has Shabal with unknown number of jihadist

582
00:58:02,808 --> 00:58:03,983
Are you kidding me?

583
00:58:03,983 --> 00:58:06,066
No, it looks like we're getting ahead of target
527

584
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:10,865
they should call a liitle more intel for shore sea

585
00:58:10,865 --> 00:58:11,949
All right

586
00:58:15,054 --> 00:58:17,395
SOUTH PACIFIC

588
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:49,509
Be safe

589
00:58:49,509 --> 00:58:51,388
You know I will, I gotta to go, Honey

00:58:51,388 --> 00:58:52,808
I love you
535

591
00:59:11,079 --> 00:59:13,311
Joann, I don't want to play with these

592
00:59:13,311 --> 00:59:18,245
Are you listening?
There's nothing to worry about

593
00:59:18,411 --> 00:59:20,560
OK?
I'll talk to you soon.

594
00:59:39,911 --> 00:59:42,560
<i>Bravo Alpha, we're 200 meters out</i>

<i>We got you have a Tango on your starboard side, Tango on your starboard side</i>

<i>Winky Charlie, we have visual on Tango</i>

01:00:27,911 --> 01:00:30,060
<i>Bubble, you have a Viper on 12 O'clock</i>

598
01:00:59,450 --> 01:01:00,887
Get out! Get out!

599
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:03,541

600
01:01:03,927 --> 01:01:04,679
Bridge secure!

601
01:01:06,366 --> 01:01:08,126
Senior, you're clear

602
01:01:33,983 --> 01:01:35,961
Good afternoon, how are you?

603
01:01:35,961 --> 01:01:39,184
Right. Do you speak Serbian Croatia?

604
01:01:39,184 --> 01:01:40,271
Russian

605
01:01:40,330 --> 01:01:41,221
Is it Russian?

606
01:01:41,221 --> 01:01:42,163
Yes

607
01:01:42,163 --> 01:01:43,822
Do not speak Russian

608
01:01:43,822 --> 01:01:44,808
English ok?

609
01:01:44,808 --> 01:01:45,902
English is fine

610
01:01:45,902 --> 01:01:46,967
Let's do that

611
01:01:46,967 --> 01:01:49,093
Can you cut him loose, please

612
01:01:49,093 --> 01:01:50,878
If you cut loose, you will not do anything crazy, right?

613
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:54,329
Crazy iron, so to speak.

614
01:01:54,904 --> 01:01:55,687
So you Russian, yeah?

615
01:01:56,511 --> 01:01:57,475
Yes, I am.

01:01:59,294 --> 01:02:00,738

01:02:59,258 --> 01:03:00,309
"starship"?

642
01:02:59,717 --> 01:03:00,945
I love the way you say "starship"

643
01:03:00,945 --> 01:03:02,546
It's like Russian

644
01:03:02,546 --> 01:03:04,662
Like guy in Star Trek, what's his name?

645
01:03:04,662 --> 01:03:06,896
Scotty, I'm sorry, Scott

646
01:03:07,196 --> 01:03:08,102
I would not

647
01:03:08,102 --> 01:03:09,322
You never seen Star Trek?

648
01:03:09,322 --> 01:03:10,205
No

649
01:03:10,205 --> 01:03:11,104
That's insane

650
01:03:11,104 --> 01:03:12,352
So, here's the problem, pal

651
01:03:12,352 --> 01:03:14,082
You're with a lot of money

652
01:03:14,956 --> 01:03:16,217
Or you <i>were</i> with a lot of money?

653
01:03:16,217 --> 01:03:17,888
I believe I still have

654
01:03:17,888 --> 01:03:18,636
You do?

655
01:03:18,636 --> 01:03:19,445
Yes

656
01:03:19,445 --> 01:03:20,495
All right 

657
01:03:20,495 --> 01:03:21,843
Let me tell you how the world works there

658
01:03:21,843 --> 01:03:23,513
Chrisco ...

659
01:03:23,529 --> 01:03:24,638
It's Christo

660
01:03:24,138 --> 01:03:24,813

<font color="#ffff01">oh, of course</font>

663
01:03:26,555 --> 01:03:27,266
Oh it's ok

664
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:29,959
Let me tell you how
the world really works

665
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:30,259
<font color="#ffff01">please</font>

666
01:03:30,048 --> 01:03:31,255
This is no longer your boat

667
01:03:31,574 --> 01:03:35,213
Since I walk through that door, you're not the same guy you used to be. You just not.

668
01:03:36,343 --> 01:03:38,022
There's nothing I can do to stop that

669
01:03:38,022 --> 01:03:39,735
Nothing I can do to help you right now

670
01:03:39,735 --> 01:03:40,950
unless you let me help you

671
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:43,580
We need to do this together pal, you and me

672
01:03:44,159 --> 01:03:47,715
So, how is you think you working with these jihadi folks then?

673
01:03:50,113 --> 01:03:51,440
Your're Jewish, right?

674
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,115
Shabal is ...what?

675
01:03:57,389 --> 01:04:00,225
Have you ever had a
friend that you grew up with?

676
01:04:00,346 --> 01:04:00,751
Sorry?

677
01:04:00,751 --> 01:04:02,886
Have you ever had a
friend that you grew up with?

678
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:03,375
<font color="#ffff01">Yes</font>

679
01:04:03,375 --> 01:04:05,012
Like play interest, like soccer..

680
01:04:05,012 --> 01:04:07,261
Or what would you play, base ball probably, right?

681
01:04:06,661 --> 01:04:07,501
<font color="#ffff01">probably</font>

682
01:04:07,341 --> 01:04:07,753
Ya
625

683
01:04:08,538 --> 01:04:11,569
And anyone has his separate ways, and some years later you meet up

684
01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:15,405
And you totally didn't recognize the person

685
01:04:16,402 --> 01:04:18,689
That's what I have been with Shabal

686
01:04:18,775 --> 01:04:21,439
We share a common interest

687
01:04:21,446 --> 01:04:24,823
So, he came up with his incredible idea

688
01:04:24,823 --> 01:04:26,819
because of his beliefs

689
01:04:26,819 --> 01:04:28,456
I don't necessarily share his beliefs

690
01:04:28,456 --> 01:04:30,249
But he's a smart guy

691
01:04:30,249 --> 01:04:31,192
You know?

692
01:04:31,192 --> 01:04:32,882
Almost like ...

693
01:04:33,402 --> 01:04:34,231
you know, almost like...

694
01:04:34,666 --> 01:04:37,036
like, this is me.

695
01:04:41,610 --> 01:04:43,254
and that's Shabal

696
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:44,076
Is it?

697
01:04:44,076 --> 01:04:45,631
And America is in between

698
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:46,414
Is it?

699
01:04:46,414 --> 01:04:47,890
Yeah 

700
01:04:49,169 --> 01:04:50,882
Cool concept, no?

701
01:04:50,934 --> 01:04:51,883
Right here?

702
01:04:51,352 --> 01:04:52,504
Yes

703
01:04:53,572 --> 01:04:55,393
You think this is some kind of game?

704
01:04:58,012 --> 01:05:00,080
Do you? You find this amusing? 

705
01:05:00,211 --> 01:05:00,857
I'm not find ...

706
01:05:00,857 --> 01:05:02,312
Do you realize what you're doing here?

707
01:05:03,449 --> 01:05:05,305
<i>Blackbeard actual to Blackbeard Main</i>

708
01:05:05,559 --> 01:05:07,998
Host nation counterpart secured target Bravo

709
01:05:08,445 --> 01:05:10,960
<i>Report strike all.
You're clear to move on target Alpha</i>

710
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:13,838
<i>Roger Main, clear to target</i>

711
01:05:17,556 --> 01:05:19,783
The only people I answer to is my family

712
01:05:20,705 --> 01:05:22,596
to my wife and to my child

713
01:05:23,686 --> 01:05:25,039
and nobody else

714
01:05:26,091 --> 01:05:27,324
Running late somewhere?

715
01:05:27,324 --> 01:05:28,964
6 after 4

716
01:05:28,964 --> 01:05:29,461
Really?

717
01:05:29,461 --> 01:05:29,890
Yeah

718
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:31,124
So ...

719
01:05:31,124 --> 01:05:32,609
Here's the problem pal

720
01:05:33,534 --> 01:05:35,376
You do love your family don't you?

721
01:05:36,439 --> 01:05:37,374
Yes I do

722
01:05:37,578 --> 01:05:38,859
And what about your daughter?

723
01:05:39,165 --> 01:05:40,129
what about my daughter?

724
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:41,962
Are you looking forward to seeing her again?

725
01:05:42,643 --> 01:05:44,108
Every minute on my life

726
01:06:06,915 --> 01:06:09,963
I wanted you to see that, 
so you can think about something

727
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,388
very seriously

728
01:06:11,713 --> 01:06:14,150
Because you're gonna be sitting
in a box somewhere

729
01:06:15,144 --> 01:06:17,759
You'll be treated properly and humanely

730
01:06:19,331 --> 01:06:23,714
That girl is gonna grow up, 
and she's gonna get married

731
01:06:24,392 --> 01:06:26,624
and your wife is gonna find someone else

732
01:06:27,391 --> 01:06:29,982
And you're gonna miss everything

733
01:06:37,538 --> 01:06:38,991
If I had done something

734
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,258
that would endanger my family

735
01:06:41,258 --> 01:06:43,201
I would feel just like you do right now

736
01:06:46,174 --> 01:06:48,101
Do you promise not to touch my family?

737
01:06:48,295 --> 01:06:49,595
I would never touch your family

738
01:06:51,401 --> 01:06:52,970
I would not

739
01:06:59,569 --> 01:07:00,823
Are you familiar with ...

740
01:07:03,363 --> 01:07:05,538
"ceramic bullbearings"?

741
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:06,419
No

742
01:07:07,968 --> 01:07:12,201
Just imagine 16 suicide vests filled with ceramic bullbearings

743
01:07:12,479 --> 01:07:14,288
Slipping by every metal detector

744
01:07:14,849 --> 01:07:15,980
and every check-point in your country.

745
01:07:18,392 --> 01:07:20,178
Do you think your economy's fcuked  now?

746
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:24,511
Just think what the
Media is gonna do with this

747
01:07:25,514 --> 01:07:31,552
It's gonna make 9/11 look like a fcuking walking park, 
the Grand Central Park

748
01:07:33,377 --> 01:07:34,995
So, you're telling me ..

749
01:07:35,891 --> 01:07:42,031
there is 16 jahadis wearing suicide vests

750
01:07:42,426 --> 01:07:45,832
they're gonna walk right accross the border

751
01:07:46,621 --> 01:07:47,990
So, where are they going ?

752
01:07:49,726 --> 01:07:52,495
San Diego, San Francisco, Houston

753
01:07:52,889 --> 01:07:54,316
You pick a city, they'll be there 

754
01:07:54,842 --> 01:07:56,336
And this is happening now ?

755
01:07:57,083 --> 01:07:58,799
It's happening as we speak

756
01:08:00,030 --> 01:08:01,035
say what?

757
01:08:02,099 --> 01:08:04,462
It's happening as we speak

758
01:08:07,653 --> 01:08:09,325
How can you stop this?

759
01:08:11,521 --> 01:08:13,904
I can't

760
01:08:15,673 --> 01:08:19,178

These some high speed shit

787
01:15:40,973 --> 01:15:43,227
Maybe we should put
this somewhere else, huh?

788
01:15:51,321 --> 01:15:53,718
Hey Sonny, find somewhere to put this would you?

789
01:16:00,394 --> 01:16:01,657

<i>Actual, mission not complete</i>

01:16:55,945 --> 01:16:59,909
<i>Stand by for follow one</i>
You only got half that you had at cell

799
01:16:59,909 --> 01:17:01,338
Target secure, Sir

800
01:17:01,338 --> 01:17:03,288
This fight isn't over yet

801
01:17:03,363 --> 01:17:04,300
<i>Now listen, </i> 
744

802
01:17:07,890 --> 01:17:10,803
<i>at 0700, we're coordinating with State</i> 

803
01:17:11,050 --> 01:17:13,166
but for now the principal job you have outside the city

804
01:17:13,166 --> 01:17:15,788
where your POC is Commander Pedros

805
01:17:15,939 --> 01:17:18,847
<i>I'll give you more details on route

807
01:17:20,386 --> 01:17:24,255
Ok, we got the hill laming on the deck, we're gonna meet a Mexican South Commander and his team

808
01:17:24,255 --> 01:17:27,254
We're gonna help infiltrate the target, and join us on the assault

809
01:17:28,542 --> 01:17:30,063
What the hell are you talking about?

810
01:17:30,063 --> 01:17:31,139
We didn't got all of them yet, Chief

811
01:17:31,139 --> 01:17:32,276
Where's the rest of it?

812
01:17:32,276 --> 01:17:33,889
They're in Mexicali,  on the border

813
01:17:34,186 --> 01:17:37,228
All right, and the rest of the boys, how they getting back to the ship?

814
01:17:37,228 --> 01:17:40,254
Bon Homme Richard stayed on station, they're gonna send them Marine helmet

815
01:17:40,254 --> 01:17:42,793
head all back split to target, and when they're done, the boys will pull off with them
760

816
01:17:43,701 --> 01:17:44,413
I'm thinking

817
01:17:44,599 --> 01:17:46,016
squad 1 and myself roll out

818
01:17:46,472 --> 01:17:49,907
- Perfect squad, Tuesday's here, buttons up, pulls out of the marines
- Ok

819
01:17:56,544 --> 01:17:58,313
But now we know to put them to town

820
01:17:58,313 --> 01:17:59,365
and crushing the sunrise

821
01:18:00,489 --> 01:18:05,241
Gather group we're gonna take as following day, the <i>wadis </i>

823
01:18:18,676 --> 01:18:23,324
Hey sir, who the hell clear us had to go to Mexicali anyway?

824
01:18:23,324 --> 01:18:27,161
this would do all that we up to the platform.
States Department on it.

825
01:18:37,734 --> 01:18:39,713
Border Wall with Mexico

826
01:19:06,176 --> 01:19:06,938

channel 2

828
01:19:13,477 --> 01:19:18,283
By this time on keep work like this, Jacky's gonna be squeezed and kicked out on road

829
01:19:19,528 --> 01:19:23,957
however, if we had this target quick enough, he jump on the burrow right at shit home

830
01:19:25,298 --> 01:19:27,453
Hey, I gonna need no burrow

831
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:30,508
you got it two weeks

832
01:19:31,138 --> 01:19:33,144
on the time I was there on the plane hall

833
01:19:33,289 --> 01:19:35,181
you were not convinced so let me go home, 

834
01:19:35,445 --> 01:19:39,728
but I'm convinced gonna leave your ass in charge

835
01:19:58,986 --> 01:20:03,258
MEXICALI,
US/MEXICO BORDER

836
01:20:45,102 --> 01:20:45,986
Sir

837
01:20:45,986 --> 01:20:46,818
Lieutenant

838
01:20:47,232 --> 01:20:50,338
Seems our government have been very busy to make this possible, huh?

839
01:20:49,838 --> 01:20:51,396
<font color="#ffff01">All the way the tough, from I heard</font>

840
01:20:51,396 --> 01:20:53,359
There is something that you have to understand

841
01:20:53,359 --> 01:20:57,654
my superiors, they're very fearful of Mexican "mogadishu"

842
01:20:57,654 --> 01:21:00,129
no black or down, that's what they're saying, so

843
01:21:00,129 --> 01:21:01,316
we do need to stay under the radar

844
01:21:01,316 --> 01:21:02,916
I understand completely Sir.

845
01:21:02,916 --> 01:21:05,447
Your team presence here is greatly appreciated

846
01:21:05,447 --> 01:21:07,192
But we're out of time, we need to move

847
01:21:07,192 --> 01:21:08,107
Tell me where, we go

848
01:21:08,107 --> 01:21:12,534
Help piece these together for me. Our intel says they using a tunnel network, 

849
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:13,625
but it's under a milk factory

850
01:21:13,625 --> 01:21:15,496
This mean anything to you?

851
01:21:15,496 --> 01:21:17,515
I know exactly where it is

852
01:21:17,515 --> 01:21:18,697
It's not far from here

853
01:21:18,697 --> 01:21:20,585
And that's where we going

854
01:21:20,585 --> 01:21:24,210
From all of the places of Mexicali you could have been, this probably the worst

855
01:21:24,210 --> 01:21:26,620
The cartels control any of that from all the angles

856
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:30,462
They had us heavily outgunned.
Simply reaching your target's gonna be very difficult

857
01:21:30,462 --> 01:21:33,353
Sir we have a thorn national's heading to our country 

858
01:21:33,353 --> 01:21:35,841
needless to say, they're no big fan of ours

859
01:21:35,841 --> 01:21:38,068
If they are in that factory, that's where we going

860
01:21:38,068 --> 01:21:40,531
Lieutenant, I'll take you anywhere you need to go

861
01:21:40,531 --> 01:21:43,503
But prepare your men for a bigger fight than you had imagine

862
01:21:43,503 --> 01:21:44,892
You're not fighting at men

863
01:21:44,892 --> 01:21:47,444
you're also fighting the cartels that protecting them.

864
01:21:47,444 --> 01:21:51,073
If your  targets make it into those tunnels, they'll disappear like ghosts

865

You enter the tunnels right here

Go! 

890
01:28:52,456 --> 01:28:53,204
One moment

891
01:28:53,432 --> 01:28:55,303
This is where you have to blow the bomb

892
01:28:57,341 --> 01:28:59,129
What happens?

893
01:28:59,338 --> 01:29:01,985

I could explain that one to my family

897

Keep back there, so I won't  have to, huh?

898
01:31:17,569 --> 01:31:18,055
Clear

899
01:31:41,206 --> 01:31:43,077
Grenaaaaaade!

900
01:32:48,230 --> 01:32:49,743

Be advised, tunnel is secure, and all threats are neutralized

904
01:35:18,431 --> 01:35:24,446
LT and Chief are down.
I say it again, LT and Chief are down.

905
01:36:20,899 --> 01:36:22,895
<i>Your father was a good man

906
01:36:23,306 --> 01:36:25,693
<i>Growing up without him is gonna be hard,

907
01:36:25,693 --> 01:36:32,103
<i>It's gonna hurt. You feel alone, out to see 
with no shore and sight  

908
01:36:46,117 --> 01:36:49,617
<i>Remember, you have your father's blood in your veins

909
01:36:49,617 --> 01:36:51,307
<i>The code that make your father who he was

910
01:36:51,307 --> 01:36:54,307
<i>is the same code that'll make you a man
 

911
01:36:57,307 --> 01:37:00,807
<i>Your father's will, his values live on in you

912
01:37:01,307 --> 01:37:04,307
<i>Like those people who is in strange painting your father admired

913
01:37:04,307 --> 01:37:07,207
<i>We man made of the boxes

914
01:37:07,207 --> 01:37:08,207

<i>and love

919
01:37:36,084 --> 01:37:38,059
<i>No one's stronger than a man

<i>who can harness his emotions and his past

921
01:37:45,158 --> 01:37:49,966
<i>use it as motivation to write the most important letter of your life

922
01:39:03,401 --> 01:39:09,049
<i>Before he died, your father 
asked me to give you this poem by Tecumseh, a man he greatly admired

923
01:39:09,049 --> 01:39:12,221
<i>I told him I'd fold it into paper airplane

924
01:39:12,232 --> 01:39:14,454
<i>and I guess that's what I'm doing

925
01:39:14,899 --> 01:39:17,420
<i>Say on it on him, to you

926
01:39:21,604 --> 01:39:24,371
<i>Live your life that the fear of death can never enter your heart

927
01:39:25,377 --> 01:39:26,984
<i>Trouble no one about his religion

928
01:39:28,443 --> 01:39:30,007
<i>respects others and their views

929
01:39:30,572 --> 01:39:32,292
</i>and demand that they respect yours

930

<i>Love your life..

<i>and of service to your people

935
01:39:44,262 --> 01:39:46,086
<i>When your time comes to die

936
01:39:46,429 --> 01:39:49,248
<i>Be not like those whose hearts are filled with fear of death

937
01:39:49,656 --> 01:39:53,187
<i>So that one their time come, they weep, and pray for little more time

938
01:39:53,187 --> 01:39:56,016
<i>to live their lifes over again and indifferently

939
01:39:56,160 --> 01:39:59,990

<i>going home...</i>
