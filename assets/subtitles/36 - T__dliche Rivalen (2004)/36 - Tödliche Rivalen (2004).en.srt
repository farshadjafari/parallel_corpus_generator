1
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,552
Sorry, we're closed.

2
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,310
Says who?

3
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,357
Write something. We'll all sign.

4
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,508
On this prank, I'm covering no one.

5
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,677
Let's wait for René!

6
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,357
Move your ass. Do what I said!

7
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,718
Clear out or I'll call the cops!

8
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,677
Cops don't scare us!

9
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,469
Down, everyone!

10
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,358
Noses on the floor! Move it!

11
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,475
Strip!

12
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,795
Kill me instead!

13
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,119
A short poem...

14
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,793
I wrote it, so listen!

15
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,830
"Eddy...

16
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,953
"Loyal friend, goodbye,

17
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,792
"Prince of the B.R.I.!

18
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,078
"You're a man so true,

19
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,912
"We will all miss you.

20
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,832
"Beloved by everyone,

21
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,911
"Without enemies, not a one.

22
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,156
"You're so dear...

23
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,230
Shaddup!

24
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,238
"That we'll all shed a tear,

25
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,197
"A new life you've found,
now you're Riviera-bound,

26
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,030
"Why go away,
leaving Titi this way?"

27
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,194
Great, Titi!

28
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,194
The gift!

29
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,829
<i>We'll see you soon, dear Eddy!</i>

30
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,595
<i>We'll meet again, for sure!</i>

31
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,269
Shit, guys!

32
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,350
A mouse!

33
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,557
Let's split!

34
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,439
Bye, thanks.

35
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,599
- How you getting home?
- A ride with Smao.

36
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,159
- OK, Big Luc.
- Titi!

37
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,119
You forget anything?

38
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,229
It was in the john!

39
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,959
- Shit!
- I'll say!

40
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,991
In case you see a mouse.

41
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,508
Thanks, Leo.

42
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,668
- I take you home?
- No, I'll take you.

43
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,350
- You're taking me?
- Yeah!

44
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,959
<i>Calling all cars.</i>

45
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,954
<i>Look out for a vehicle,</i>
<i>after armed robbery</i>

46
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,271
<i>by three hooded men,</i>
<i>flight direction unknown.</i>

47
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,955
<i>Calling all cars, re a vehicle</i>

48
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,238
<i>a black wagon,</i>
<i>with 3 hooded men...</i>

49
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,829
Hi, Dennis...

50
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,349
Hi, Leo.

51
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,710
You're wrecks!

52
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,159
Eddy's farewell dinner.
What's the score?

53
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,552
One conveyor dead, one mangled,

54
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,153
150,000 Euros gone.

55
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,671
Witnesses?

56
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,996
Only empty offices.

57
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,355
Same guns,
same C4 explosives, same planning.

58
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,317
It's them again.

59
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,355
Look around.

60
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,436
You won't find much,
but go ahead.

61
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,676
The headless man says hi!

62
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,277
Blown away by a mercury bullet.

63
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,791
Eve Verhagen, OCU.

64
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,632
Eddy Valence, BRI.

65
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,798
Yeah, I can read.

66
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,833
Where do you hail from?

67
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,992
Suburban narcotics squad.

68
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,229
Sick of smashing syringes?

69
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,039
You could say that.

70
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,955
Klein is sulking,
stay with him.

71
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,031
Don't chat with the enemy.

72
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,236
We're enemies?

73
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,313
BRl/OCU, it's an old rivalry.

74
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,799
- Aren't we a big family?
- So they say.

75
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,478
She's private property.

76
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,395
Klein's?

77
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,549
Who else?

78
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,275
How could you be pals with him?

79
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,712
He wasn't always like this.

80
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,355
Their names?

81
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,193
Winterstein.

82
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,672
Bruno and Rolf.

83
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,075
The one who did me was Bruno.

84
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,672
Christo warned me:

85
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,158
"Your big mouth
will get you in trouble."

86
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,597
Now it has.

87
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,193
7 vans in 18 months

88
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,719
9 conveyors slaughtered,
and a 2 million Euro booty.

89
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,670
The Ministry of the Interior
sent us a memo.

90
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,958
Asking us, and I quote:

91
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,714
"To tackle the problem head on

92
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,071
"and neutralize the criminals

93
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,232
"who've derided
our forces for too long."

94
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,075
"Too long" is bad!

95
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,835
Means we've been around
for too long, doing nothing!

96
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,032
As of today you're on duty
24 hours a day!

97
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,799
Drop your personal problems,

98
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,794
don't laze on Sundays,

99
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,675
go out and nab that gang of fuckers

100
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,353
before they strike

101
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,233
for the 8th time!

102
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,233
You got that?

103
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,756
Got that,

104
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,512
Capt. Kechichian?

105
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,109
We were up late.
For a good cause.

106
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,080
Sure, loitering in a bar at 2 AM,

107
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,435
after defacing the wall

108
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,353
of a Government building,
how can I fault you

109
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,078
for being so admirable!

110
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,673
- Anything else?
- A lead on the van jobs.

111
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,473
A Serbian arms-dealer:
Victor Dragan.

112
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,273
We got a tip off

113
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,509
from an informant.

114
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,556
A reliable source?

115
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,995
Not at all.

116
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,595
What do you say?

117
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,109
I know the fellow.
A sadistic loner.

118
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,199
Barring a lucky break,

119
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,395
he'll be tough to nail.

120
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,913
Luck can be engineered.

121
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,636
Briefing's over!

122
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,952
Vrinks, you stay.

123
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,676
I've been appointed
Police Commissioner.

124
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,989
As of when?

125
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,229
I take over on Sept 1.

126
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,919
Congratulations.

127
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,997
I hate to leave
before I've cleaned house.

128
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,192
I want that gang, Leo.

129
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,632
As my farewell gift.

130
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,469
You'll get them.

131
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,393
Another thing:

132
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,676
Someone will get my desk.

133
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,349
You're the right man.

134
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,836
Klein wants to be Chief.

135
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,235
He wants power, that's different.

136
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,593
But you both qualify:

137
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,355
Same rank, seniority,
service rating.

138
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,673
So whoever nails that scum,
will be king.

139
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,034
I don't mix with brass.

140
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,633
It's better than mixing
with whores and hoods.

141
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,956
Times have changed.

142
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,956
Get yourself a new style.

143
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,997
You're an anomaly.
Your men, your methods.

144
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,515
In the police,
now you toe the line, you snap to.

145
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,797
If you don't,
no one will cover for you.

146
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,670
All the brass have caved in.

147
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,556
Even you?

148
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,151
Lay off me, shit!

149
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,349
Who the fuck are you?

150
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,473
Shit, what ya doin'?

151
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,516
Who the fuck are you?

152
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,034
What have I done?

153
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,270
Don't do that, don't!

154
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,989
Lay off Manou, or I'll stuff you
with your brother's head.

155
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,152
Quite a shiv!

156
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,075
War booty.

157
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,079
Creep's gotta
hitchhike buck-naked,

158
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,675
and cuffed!

159
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,193
We shoulda wasted him!

160
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,758
Gotta be ten grand!

161
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,673
A year's pay for a flatfoot.
Those fuckers!

162
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,594
For our slush fund?

163
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,594
No, it's for Manou.

164
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:34,996
Leo.

165
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:36,791
Come in.

166
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,994
Hi, Christo.

167
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,231
Manou's resting in her room.
I'll tell her you're here.

168
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,594
Let her rest.

169
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,355
She OK?

170
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,550
Just OK.

171
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,478
Still after that van gang?

172
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,754
Still am.

173
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,278
I hear they hit again.

174
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,678
Near the beltway, right?

175
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,236
My only advice is:
When you bust 'em, shoot first!

176
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,958
You know anything?

177
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,679
I'm not a snitch.

178
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,151
Ask your questions elsewhere.

179
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,068
Who worked over Manou?

180
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,588
What do you mean?

181
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,830
Leo...

182
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,908
I'm 46,
I spent 18 years in jail.

183
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,039
She's the best thing
that happened to me.

184
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,757
Someone hurt her, I gotta know.

185
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,831
If I tell you, what'll you do?

186
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,353
That's up to me.

187
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,637
You're in trouble
any time you step out of here!

188
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,233
You're a hood, Christo.

189
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,038
With a record for armed robbery.

190
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,313
If you smack your neighbor
over a trifle, you go back to jail!

191
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,309
Manou needs you:

192
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,675
If you go down, so does she.

193
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,036
Screw your cop morality.

194
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,557
Anyway, it's settled.
I dealt with it.

195
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,470
This is to make amends.
Around 7 grand.

196
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,034
I'll see you out.

197
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,634
Thanks, Leo.

198
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,634
I won't forget.

199
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,113
The guy
you're looking for, Dragan.

200
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,315
I know where he is.

201
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,157
At a chick's place on Borrego St.

202
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,117
Don't ask how I know.

203
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,112
Police! Freeze!

204
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,310
Stay there!

205
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,517
Get up!

206
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,958
Let me hug my kid.

207
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,154
Your wrists!

208
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,029
Sign there.

209
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,037
Have a nice leave, Silien.

210
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,913
Your Puch's in the toolbox.

211
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,432
With a 2nd clip, just in case.

212
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,919
This is dumb, Silien.

213
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,229
You got 3 weeks to do.

214
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,115
Watch the road.

215
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,908
Neat vodka.

216
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,118
You kept Dragan to yourself.

217
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,835
Was that wrong?

218
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,954
Don't they say,
it takes two to tango?

219
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,668
We're not dancing anymore.

220
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,039
Anyway, he was a bum lead.

221
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,476
How do you know?

222
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,553
I know. That's all.

223
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,279
<i>Silien here.</i>
<i>How are you, Captain?</i>

224
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,114
<i>Am I intruding?</i>

225
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,835
<i>Sure, it's after midnight.</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>

226
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,514
In a hotel.
I'm out till tomorrow night.

227
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,557
On a leave. Wasn't a jailbreak.

228
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,799
<i>I gotta see you fast.</i>

229
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,439
Tonight, I can't.

230
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,315
You'll regret it.
Meet me in 1 hr at "Swann's".

231
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,510
Same again?

232
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,314
No, thanks.

233
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,193
Camille OK?

234
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,755
She's fine.

235
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,429
When did you buy this?

236
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,079
We'll talk cars later.
What's up?

237
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,830
Nice welcome!
You haven't seen me

238
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,911
in 4 years. Don't I rate a smile?

239
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,678
This is a favor for a pal inside.

240
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,998
You made me cross Paris
for a lousy scam?

241
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,229
I got a hot tip.

242
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,956
You're a piece of shit.

243
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,197
What is it?

244
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,271
Heavy duty stuff. Real hot tip.

245
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,348
Want it or not?

246
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,390
What's the deal?

247
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,473
Just stay with me.
In a half-hour, it's done.

248
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,194
Here he is.

249
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,392
Stay in the car!

250
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:57,751
Get going!

251
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,869
Stop it!

252
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,837
Why'd you screw me?

253
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,350
Stop it!

254
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,676
Stop, dammit!

255
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,637
I know who the van gang are.

256
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,835
And their next stunt.

257
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,318
They're in the sticks.

258
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,874
It starts from there.

259
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,516
In exchange, you cover me.

260
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,279
Or get nailed with me.

261
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,955
Who did you waste?

262
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,473
Marcus Zerbib,
his driver and his goon.

263
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,834
Marcus Zerbib?

264
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,711
The guy who put you in jail?

265
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,310
You'll get nabbed right away!

266
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,033
Not with a good alibi.

267
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,109
Now...

268
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,193
you can grab
the worst gang around.

269
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,674
Choose.

270
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,953
OK, let's have it.

271
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,759
I know two of 'em:

272
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,430
Francis Horn
and Robert Boulanger.

273
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,955
They're squatting in St Ouen.

274
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,072
On Captain Glarner St.

275
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,036
- Don't you say hi?
- I hadn't seen you.

276
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,270
- Want a drink?
- I'm with friends.

277
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,192
You got friends now?

278
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,750
Your only friend is me.

279
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,311
If I conk out, you're dead.

280
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,476
Here's my direct line,

281
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,198
so you can't forget it.

282
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,115
Give me a lead, fast.

283
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,674
That gang...

284
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,513
I want their names first.

285
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,636
Nobody knows them, I swear!

286
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,190
I want news from you.
Stay in touch.

287
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,231
So I know you're OK.

288
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,072
Good seeing you again.

289
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,149
How'd you get that?

290
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,117
It's nothing. At work.

291
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,155
Why not tell me what you do?

292
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,117
I don't want to lose you.

293
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,079
You get home late, leave early.

294
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,075
Lots of cops live that way.

295
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,231
Many wind up all alone.

296
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,229
What are you after?

297
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,879
Nothing.

298
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,359
I just do my job.

299
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,151
Get up, lazybones!

300
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,789
- Say: "Morning, Dad".
- Morning, Dad.

301
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,671
And give him a kiss.

302
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,113
No school today?

303
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,309
Never on Wednesday.
You know that.

304
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,675
Yeah, if I knew it's Wednesday.

305
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,154
Mom in?

306
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,117
Rushing as usual.

307
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,914
Thanks for the...

308
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,749
coffee!

309
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,510
My ass is spreading,
that's bad.

310
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,276
I don't mind, I love big asses.

311
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,031
Know what my big ass says to you?

312
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,514
That it misses me.

313
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,391
Sunday's my dad's 70th birthday.
He hopes we'll come.

314
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,314
There'll be a crowd.
You don't have to talk.

315
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,440
- What crowd?
- My mom's family.

316
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,996
Uncles, aunts,
cousins coming from Rome.

317
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:04,917
We'll see.

318
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,514
Lola, hurry!

319
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,313
Bye, daddy-o.

320
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,595
Bye, honey.

321
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,078
6 slugs were fired.

322
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,790
2 hit the driver,
1 the goon, 3 Zerbib.

323
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,438
No one saw much.
The building's all oldies.

324
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:44,469
By the time they shuffled
to a window, it was all over.

325
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,191
But the concierge saw a girl

326
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,590
get out of the Merc and run away.

327
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,479
Brunette, red coat, a BJ artist.

328
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,157
Zerbib liked cheap whores.
We'll find her.

329
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,157
That's for Homicide, not us.

330
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,273
You knew him well?

331
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,473
Enough to want to nab his killer.

332
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:14,114
Vrinks, BRI.
The names Horn and Boulanger.

333
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,796
Give me all you've got.

334
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,353
What's with the Zerbib case?

335
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,316
He was getting a BJ in the car.

336
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,631
Had his dong out
and his pants down.

337
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,634
A concierge saw the girl
leave after the shooting.

338
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,319
She see anything else?

339
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,790
Ask Homicide, it's their baby.

340
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,949
Can I see the telex?

341
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,795
Boulanger.

342
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,996
I got several, which do you want?

343
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,469
Robert.

344
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,110
Francis Horn
and Robert Boulanger, aka Bob.

345
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,951
Horn: Armed robbery record.
Wanted for theft,

346
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,759
armed robbery, extortion
and attempted murder.

347
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,952
Weapons freak, ex-mercenary,

348
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,793
trained in Syria, a real psycho.

349
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,037
Boulanger broke from jail

350
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,919
2 years ago, killing a guard
and an officer.

351
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,914
Seems Horn sprung Boulanger

352
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,196
to have him on his team.

353
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,839
I have no other names,

354
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,877
but they operate from here,

355
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,077
a squat beside a warehouse
by the beltway.

356
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:49,235
First, we find lookouts
and set up surveillance teams.

357
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:53,712
Smao and Titi will be in the silo
overlooking the squat.

358
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,314
You photograph everyone
coming and going.

359
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,069
You identify all vehicles,

360
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,794
and any lowlifes in the area.

361
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,350
Second, we cordon off the area,
block escape routes,

362
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,478
one team per street in a perimeter

363
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,950
of half a mile within the area.

364
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,236
Third, we advise the local police

365
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,709
we'll be playing
on their turf for a few days,

366
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,189
and to lie low
on the day we make the grab.

367
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,909
No neighborhood investigations
or questioning,

368
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:28,516
we avoid concierges,
storekeepers, local hangouts.

369
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,709
Klein, OCU.
You don't know me, I know you.

370
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,673
No waves: We settle in, watch and wait.

371
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,909
Know what they'll hit?

372
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,354
No. We can't lose them.

373
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,069
Let's go. Wear bulletproof vests
over your T-shirts.

374
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,910
We have a common friend,

375
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,913
a friend who just died.

376
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,035
Marcus Zerbib, you know him?

377
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,110
He wasn't a friend.

378
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,792
You two were in business.

379
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,269
Some nasty gossips say
he snitched on you 4 years ago.

380
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,072
The guys he snitched on
would fill the phone book.

381
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,915
But only you could gun him down

382
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,753
in cold blood,
during a leave from jail.

383
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,957
Would I waste him
when I have 2 weeks left to do?

384
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,709
What's wrong, Leo?

385
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,711
- Nothing, why?
- Don't kid me.

386
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,508
You're lost, I can tell.

387
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,233
I'm in deep shit,
and I can't discuss it.

388
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,476
Not even with me?

389
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,555
Not even with you.

390
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,075
- Where were you that night?
- With a cop.

391
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,279
HQ's finest cop.
We met at "Swann's"

392
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,113
at 1 AM, we chewed the fat
till 5 AM,

393
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,748
then he dropped me at my hotel. OK?

394
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,596
His name?

395
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,356
Vrinks.

396
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,159
I'll need your boys.

397
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,675
What for?

398
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,352
We located the van gang.

399
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,469
How'd you get the tip?

400
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,194
Know a man called Silien?

401
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,316
Why?

402
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,154
Says he was with you
when Zerbib died.

403
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,236
If he says so, must be true.

404
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,551
Could I have that in writing?

405
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,788
Investigating murders now?

406
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,998
When my snitches get killed.

407
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,031
Those fuckers
give me a giant hard-on.

408
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,429
Some get laid, others freeze!

409
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,069
We're on the wrong team.

410
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,549
No, that's his last fuck.

411
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:58,956
We'll hump again.

412
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,716
You sure?

413
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,995
<i>Big Luc to Fat Ass.</i>

414
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,831
Mercedes wagon,
local plates, 4 men on board.

415
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,911
<i>It's headed your way.</i>

416
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,317
Long-haired guy is Frank Chenaf.

417
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,628
I nabbed him
for a holdup 10 years ago.

418
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,599
A mean fucker.

419
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,875
I don't know the others.

420
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,278
Sa<i>:</i>i<i>:</i>d and Jamel Attia.

421
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,798
I say it's for tomorrow.

422
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,192
Nabbing 'em in the act's dumb.

423
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:46,877
They'll fire at us. We may
lose them to avoid bloodshed.

424
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,550
What do you suggest?

425
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,278
We hit 'em at night,

426
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,553
and gun down the lot of them.

427
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,599
What about our ethics code?

428
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,392
I've wiped my ass
with that for years.

429
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,950
They killed 9 men.

430
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,437
9 families

431
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:17,310
call me every week hoping
I'll have good news at last.

432
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,238
I owe it to them.

433
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,269
It obsesses me.

434
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,593
Stay home,
let Vrinks deal with it.

435
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,028
I've worked 2 years
on this case.

436
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,314
It's my collar
as much as anyone's.

437
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,432
OK, but you'll be back-up.

438
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,150
You only move in on Vrinks's orders.

439
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,788
He and his men are the front line.

440
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,552
He's in charge of this.

441
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,873
Whether you like it or not.

442
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,196
Igor here, they're coming out.

443
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,752
- <i>Headed for the cars.</i>
- Gotcha.

444
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,272
Big Luc here, they're coming out.

445
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,836
Two black SUV's and a Mercedes.

446
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,835
Standby.
I'll advise when they move.

447
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,836
Seurat-Chenaf in the lead car,

448
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,838
the Attia brothers in the second.

449
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,350
And the rest?

450
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,155
- I only see Boulanger.
- <i>The SUV's are off.</i>

451
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,436
They're taking off.

452
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,389
<i>The SUV's are leaving.</i>

453
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,192
Very slowly.

454
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,115
I see them.

455
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,713
<i>They just passed us.</i>

456
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,073
Let 'em leave the area.

457
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,557
<i>Guy and Bernie tail the SUV's.</i>

458
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,234
<i>We tail Horn, Boulanger,</i>
<i>the chick.</i>

459
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,358
We only hit 'em at the warehouse.

460
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,990
<i>I repeat: Don't hit 'em here!</i>

461
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,193
The SUV's are stopped
at the entrance.

462
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,875
- <i>Horn and the chick are out.</i>
- We'll be OK.

463
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,837
<i>Armed to the teeth.</i>

464
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,509
Where's he going?

465
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,519
Eve to Dennis. What's up?

466
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,517
<i>What are the orders?</i>

467
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,151
<i>They're about to leave.</i>

468
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,189
Shit, someone's moving!

469
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,637
<i>Klein's headed for the squat.</i>

470
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,274
- <i>He's alone.</i>
- What's he up to?

471
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,193
<i>He's drawn his gun,</i>
<i>headed for them.</i>

472
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,351
<i>Dennis to Leo.</i>
<i>What is this?</i>

473
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,959
What is this? Answer!

474
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,076
Cops, behind you.

475
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,829
<i>Move in at once!</i>

476
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,513
I said: Move in now!

477
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,917
- Shit, Big Luc!
- They hit me!

478
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,636
Grenade!

479
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,234
Come on, bitch!
Drop your guns!

480
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,358
Drop your gun, pig!

481
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,078
Drop your guns,
hands on your heads!

482
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,952
Hands on your head!

483
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,358
Come along, bitch!

484
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,357
Let go of her!

485
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:19,270
Fuck you!

486
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,188
Shut up! Drop your gun!

487
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,549
Drop your gun. I'll waste her!

488
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:25,790
On your knees!

489
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,552
Kneel! That's better!

490
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,718
Hands behind your head, scumbag!

491
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,640
If you tail me,
I'll waste the bitch!

492
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,358
Don't take her, take me.

493
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,879
You're dead! Stay put!

494
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,836
State police found Eve
lying on the freeway.

495
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,835
She jumped out of the moving car.

496
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,236
Fucker's got some nerve!

497
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,673
Big Luc, Smao...

498
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,519
What does this mean?

499
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,872
The Commissioner didn't like

500
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,634
you and your men's stunt
at the funeral.

501
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:31,910
Screw him!

502
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,395
I know.

503
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,397
But I'm warning you.

504
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,069
Of what?

505
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:46,228
Top brass are like old maids:
You don't ream them.

506
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,992
Get your men back in line,

507
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,391
drop the petitions,
the strike threats,

508
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,950
the defaming of Klein.

509
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:58,157
Klein goofed,
he has to be punished.

510
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,953
That's for Internal Affairs, not you.

511
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,837
An investigation's under way.

512
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,434
If Klein was responsible
for this fuck-up,

513
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,192
it'll come out.

514
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:12,632
Taking on Klein
is taking on the hierarchy,

515
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,631
which is
questioning the system.

516
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:16,868
You can't do that.

517
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,633
So Eddy died in vain?

518
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,272
He died doing his duty.

519
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,394
Sorry.

520
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,754
I owe him the truth.

521
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,473
What's that?

522
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:41,437
Requests for transfers.
We all signed.

523
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:43,994
It's Klein or us,

524
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,598
you decide.

525
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,473
<i>It's Dennis.</i>

526
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:15,758
I hear you're testifying
against me at the inquiry.

527
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,515
Valence's death was Fate, pal.

528
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:24,753
Stirring up shit
won't bring him back. You agree?

529
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:26,990
I'm gonna hang up.

530
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,075
You can't do this to me.

531
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,994
<i>You can't.</i>

532
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:36,959
This job,

533
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,232
is all I have.

534
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,672
So don't crap on me,

535
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,478
<i>or you'll regret it!</i>

536
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,516
- Where is he?
- Room 24, 2nd floor.

537
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,511
- And the witness?
- He split.

538
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:17,195
He's married and was with a chick,
didn't want any heat.

539
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,440
Pulling strings
is an insult to Valence.

540
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:25,112
I can't, Dennis.
Some deaths you can't touch.

541
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:26,835
- Are you refusing?
- No.

542
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:30,392
As I said, this isn't any old file.

543
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:33,154
He was a fine cop,
the union backs Vrinks.

544
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,994
Unless we humor them,
Police HQ will be up in arms.

545
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:44,154
All I can do is try
to convince the board

546
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:46,914
not to suspend you.

547
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:50,434
With your record, it should work.

548
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,158
And if it doesn't?

549
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,232
Police! Freeze!

550
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:36,036
Know why I didn't kill you, Horn?

551
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,958
Death only happens once.

552
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:41,637
I won't let it surprise you.

553
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:46,717
You'll wait for it in a cell,
like an idiot,

554
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:48,834
until you go nuts

555
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,354
from loneliness.

556
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,673
Know what?

557
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:55,876
One day
I'll be behind your door!

558
00:54:58,480 --> 00:54:59,435
I'll kill you

559
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,638
and your whole family.

560
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:03,919
I doubt it.

561
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,718
Can I see you a minute?

562
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:21,874
Boulanger's dead.

563
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,312
A freeway roadblock.

564
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,153
He tried to run it.

565
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,872
Gift from the Commissioner.

566
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,510
With a letter of congratulations.

567
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:40,634
To be shared among you.

568
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,119
200 Euros.

569
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,672
Doesn't cover Eddy's wreath.

570
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,833
Klein's in front of the board in 2 days.

571
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:53,750
I know.

572
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:58,829
Let the system handle it.
If you mess things up,

573
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,273
they'll make you pay for it.

574
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:03,555
Where do you stand?

575
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,269
Me...

576
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:10,193
I've already left.

577
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,279
Evening, Captain.

578
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,953
I hear things are edgy at HQ.

579
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:04,110
It's a problem for cops.

580
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,353
Not for you.

581
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:10,271
- That why you wanted to see me?
- No, for my girlfriend.

582
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,108
She got busted.

583
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:16,075
They claim she's hooking
and gave it to the Aliens Office.

584
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,156
She may be expelled and fined.

585
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:20,749
What do I care?

586
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:22,516
The Zerbib affair

587
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:24,348
interest you?

588
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:25,677
Go on.

589
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,149
He died in her mouth.

590
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:32,156
Fix her case, you never heard of me,

591
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,469
she'll tell all.

592
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:38,310
I'm listening.

593
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:42,389
There were two men.

594
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:47,590
<i>One fired,</i>
<i>the other waited in the car.</i>

595
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:53,432
<i>I saw the one in the car today.</i>

596
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:56,595
<i>Where did you see him?</i>

597
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:59,793
<i>At Police HQ.</i>

598
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:01,673
<i>He's a cop.</i>

599
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,035
What do you want?

600
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,633
Issued by Judge Rousseau,

601
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:19,518
instructions to search your home
and take you in for questioning.

602
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:20,271
You crazy?

603
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,598
You'd better let us in.

604
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,308
Go fuck yourself!

605
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:25,913
You got fucked, Vrinks.

606
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,196
Search the whole place.

607
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,110
Leo,

608
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:50,949
what's happening?

609
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,033
Who is this?

610
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:54,709
It's nothing. Stay with Lola.

611
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,793
- Who's Lola?
- My daughter.

612
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:58,151
Who are you?

613
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,635
Internal Affairs.
Don't worry.

614
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,079
Why are they arresting you?

615
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:05,231
Later, Camille. Do what I said.

616
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:13,432
Camille called.

617
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:15,990
What did she want?

618
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,235
What do you think?

619
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,195
Was Leo's arrest your doing?

620
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:27,835
It wasn't my doing.

621
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,151
He was arrested for being dumb.
I did my job.

622
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,078
Yourjob is jailing your friends?

623
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,880
When they cross the line, yes.

624
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,229
You won't fulfill yourself that way.

625
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:42,876
Meaning?

626
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:49,157
Becoming the fine cop
you'll never be.

627
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:10,357
Why didn't you tell me?

628
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:12,638
What for?

629
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:16,633
We nailed Horn and his gang.

630
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:18,879
The rest is a detail.

631
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:20,951
It could jail you for 10 years.

632
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:25,032
You covered up a murder.
You don't realize.

633
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,235
No.

634
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:29,309
I got screwed by my informant,
not the same.

635
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:33,356
I owed him for his tip.
You'd have done the same.

636
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:36,675
I'm not you.

637
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:40,909
What should I do?

638
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:44,200
Come clean:
Don't crap Internal Affairs.

639
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:47,313
The hooker recognized you and Silien.

640
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,956
Denial makes you an accomplice.

641
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,990
I gotta snitch on Silien?

642
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:56,277
He put you in deep shit.
Tell us where he is.

643
01:00:56,520 --> 01:01:00,035
- It's your only chance.
- I don't know where he is.

644
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:12,154
Judge Rousseau
has been assigned to the case.

645
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:16,115
You know him.

646
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:21,118
He hates cops, he'll slaughter you.

647
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,952
...Closing a blind eye

648
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:30,078
on 3 murders to protect an informant

649
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,470
and arrest a vicious gang is one thing.

650
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:35,874
That this led to a colleague's death,

651
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:38,395
and the events that ensued,
is another.

652
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:41,312
What is serious, Vrinks,

653
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:46,312
is that your silence
meant Silien was freed.

654
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:49,598
He's a menace to society.

655
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:55,595
I won't dwell on the ethics
of policemen and informants.

656
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,397
We both know it's open

657
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:01,438
to personal interpretation,

658
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:04,713
and rests on fuzzy rules and controls.

659
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:10,196
But there's a principle
all police officers must obey:

660
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:15,074
Never to guarantee impunity
to an informant,

661
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:18,910
or take the place ofjustice,

662
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,111
whatever the goals.

663
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,190
See you soon, boss!

664
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:28,637
That's why I'm ordering
your incarceration.

665
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:18,599
Dennis Klein,
badge number 628049.

666
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:22,355
You appeared
before this board to answer

667
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:25,956
on your responsibility
in the death of Lt. Eddy Valence

668
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:28,759
during a police operation
on Glarner St,

669
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:31,559
in St Ouen, last January 12th.

670
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:35,509
Seeing the findings
of the Internal Affairs Division,

671
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,398
by Chief Inspector Staneck,

672
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:39,951
and the statement by Lt. Jenner

673
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:44,074
confirming
that you acted in self-defense,

674
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:46,917
as the man Francis Horn had

675
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:49,310
"spontaneously opened fire,

676
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:52,552
"while you were
on a reconnaissance mission."

677
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:56,310
Seeing that Capt. Vrinks's statement

678
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:58,790
was held to be inadmissible

679
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,394
due to his present situation,

680
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,312
and his closeness to the victim,

681
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:07,359
this board clears you
of all responsibility

682
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,351
in this tragic matter.

683
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:10,475
Hence,

684
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:12,713
all charges are dropped,

685
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,070
nothing will appear

686
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:18,549
in your file.

687
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:34,909
Among criminals,

688
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,548
guys like you end up on a vacant lot,

689
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:39,919
with 3 slugs in their head.

690
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:46,399
Among criminals, guys like me
don't listen to guys like you.

691
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:10,196
When'll Dad be back?

692
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:13,195
Soon.

693
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:16,112
But he hasn't left us?

694
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:19,032
Why do you say that?

695
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:22,430
Because you're sad.

696
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:25,917
Usually when he's away,
you're not sad.

697
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:31,598
Usually, he doesn't go so far away.

698
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:57,271
Your Honor,

699
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:00,475
I'm Captain Vrinks's wife.

700
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:04,158
My husband has been
jailed for almost 3 weeks.

701
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:06,515
I'm still not allowed to see him.

702
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:08,075
My little girl

703
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:11,038
asks for news
of her dad every night.

704
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:12,317
Why do this?

705
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:16,429
You could issue me
a visiting permit now.

706
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:18,918
I have a lunch date.

707
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:20,469
Excuse me.

708
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:38,676
Who is this?

709
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:41,309
I want to help you.

710
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:43,075
Help me do what?

711
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:46,313
I can't say on the phone.
Can we meet?

712
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:48,074
<i>I'll call later.</i>

713
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,752
<i>I can't say on the phone.</i>

714
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:55,956
It's him.

715
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:56,950
<i>I'll call later.</i>

716
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:58,348
It's his voice.

717
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:02,110
Tap her phone day and night.
Don't miss his call.

718
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:05,875
When you've zeroed in on Silien,
advise me. Only me!

719
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:11,072
Hello, Camille.

720
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:15,108
Got time for a coffee?

721
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,633
What do you want?

722
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:22,629
To say I'm sorry
for what happened.

723
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:24,758
I didn't want this.

724
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:27,677
If you need anything...

725
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:30,317
I don't need you, Dennis.

726
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,916
I haven't for ages.

727
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:36,639
Is that all?

728
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:38,590
No...

729
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:01,233
That won't be necessary.

730
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:05,795
One question, Mr Vrinks:
The same one.

731
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:08,235
Where's your friend Hugo Silien?

732
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:09,954
My answer hasn't changed.

733
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:12,239
You can take him back.

734
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,039
Why treat me this way?

735
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:18,231
It's how I treat people here.

736
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:21,034
I'm not like them.
I'm a cop.

737
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:22,834
You're nothing now.

738
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:27,669
Handcuffs! Don't move!

739
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:31,796
The other one.

740
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:35,869
Don't worsen things.

741
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:38,395
Cuff yourselves
to the radiator! Fast!

742
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:39,436
Don't move, asshole!

743
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:41,358
Hurry!

744
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,633
Why did you do it?

745
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:13,875
To see you.

746
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:16,951
Now what'll they do?

747
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:22,200
Put me in the corner,
till it blows over.

748
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,632
Then I'll be let back in.

749
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:28,789
- When?
- Soon.

750
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:32,590
Hold out!

751
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,516
If you can outside,
I can inside.

752
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:38,993
They can't keep me for long.

753
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:42,592
Why didn't you tell me?

754
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:45,228
So they couldn't question you.

755
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:49,553
How's Lola?

756
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:51,110
She misses you.

757
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:55,909
What did you tell her?

758
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,353
The truth.

759
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:05,269
Dennis came to see me at work.

760
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:08,436
What for?

761
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:13,037
He wanted to know
if I knew a man called Silien.

762
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:16,593
What did you say?

763
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:18,314
Nothing.

764
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:20,589
I said nothing.

765
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:22,830
- Has he tried to reach you?
- Who?

766
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:23,989
Silien. Has he?

767
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:27,713
Answer, Camille.

768
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:29,314
No one called.

769
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:30,913
Stay away, he's bad news.

770
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:32,954
You promise?

771
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:36,279
I promise.

772
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:39,229
I love you.

773
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:49,559
I love you, too.

774
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:51,559
Kiss Lola.

775
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:20,599
We can go now.

776
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,038
Let me welcome here

777
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:48,397
our new Police Chief,
Mr Robert Mancini.

778
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:52,438
And introduce you
to the man who succeeds him

779
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:56,036
as the new head of the CID.

780
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,117
Captain Dennis Klein.

781
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,711
Let's wish them both good luck.

782
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:12,076
To the new head!

783
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:15,756
What are you after?

784
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:17,879
Nothing...

785
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:21,515
I came to watch you, to learn.

786
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:27,159
Thinking of him?

787
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:28,275
Should I?

788
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:34,234
I thought cops were special,

789
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:36,432
above bad things.

790
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:39,797
Why should we be?
Give me a good reason.

791
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:41,828
We're paid to be better.

792
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:43,439
My respects, Chief.

793
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:48,317
Throw the fucker out!

794
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:50,073
Put him in the drunk tank.

795
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:53,515
Let go!

796
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:55,472
I know the way out!

797
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:58,154
He'll resign once he's sober!

798
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:04,790
Under me, you'd better
lose your bad habits!

799
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:18,839
<i>This is Captain Klein's number.</i>

800
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,195
<i>Leave a message after the beep.</i>

801
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:25,313
<i>Boss, it's Jenner. Are you in?</i>

802
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:29,799
<i>We tapped Silien calling her again.</i>
<i>They're meeting at...</i>

803
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:30,990
I'm listening.

804
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,399
Subject got in.

805
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,672
They're on Rte 20, freeway bound.

806
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:17,913
Zebra 4 stay put,
let them come to you.

807
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:21,157
3 and 5 stay behind.
We'll nab 'em by the freeway.

808
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:23,351
Think of her, it's risky.

809
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:26,756
Drive.

810
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:39,472
There's 20 grand for you.

811
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:41,839
You and your daughter.

812
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,272
Until Leo's out.

813
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:46,918
I should say thanks.

814
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:50,553
My letter explains things.
I can't do more.

815
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:52,039
If they nab me, I'll get life.

816
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:54,270
How long's Leo in for?

817
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:57,439
Those are the rules.
He took a gamble and lost.

818
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:00,349
Damn that.
What can you do for him?

819
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,069
Nothing.

820
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:06,869
What's this?

821
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:08,308
You snitched!

822
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:10,078
Turn! Stop!

823
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:22,516
<i>They're headed for you now.</i>

824
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:31,599
- Don't let her by!
- I must!

825
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:33,153
Don't let her by! Dammit!

826
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:27,151
I hear you want a transfer.

827
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:30,596
Too bad.

828
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:35,479
I'd put up your name
for promotion to Captain.

829
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:38,159
Like the others?

830
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:41,150
They saw it was a smart move.

831
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:44,191
I'm not made for your clan.

832
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:48,153
I'm a plain cop,
no dumber than others.

833
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,279
I'm fine as I am.

834
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:57,477
Then why didn't you speak up?

835
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:01,755
Vrinks jailed, his wife dead,
you as boss, suits 'em all.

836
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:05,512
Why should I blab?

837
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:10,509
One day the ghosts
will come and take you away.

838
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,398
You'll have to answer

839
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:14,754
for your dirty tricks.

840
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:20,918
Some day,
we all have to die...

841
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:12,395
We have to go.

842
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:14,110
Sorry.

843
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:18,040
I want to kiss my daughter.
Not cuffed.

844
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:20,390
I can't. It's the rule.

845
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:25,356
I'll handle it.

846
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:31,830
No one knows why Silien shot her.

847
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:46,239
Bye, darling.

848
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:50,199
I'll be back soon. Wait for me.

849
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:52,354
You going back to jail?

850
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:55,398
Yes, I'll write you every day.

851
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:58,836
- Don't leave me alone, Dad.
- I'm not.

852
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:03,272
Granpa's there.

853
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:04,909
I love you, darling.

854
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,437
I love you, too.

855
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:54,991
<i>Captain Vrinks released from jail...</i>

856
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:58,199
Turn it up.

857
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:00,794
<i>... for complicity</i>
<i>to 2nd degree murder,</i>

858
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:03,838
<i>the former BRI chief</i>
<i>was freed for good conduct</i>

859
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,752
<i>after serving 7 years.</i>

860
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:09,959
<i>A reminder, too,</i>
<i>of his wife's tragic death</i>

861
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:14,079
<i>during the arrest of Hugo Silien,</i>
<i>alleged killer of Marcus Zerbib...</i>

862
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:23,355
Come in!

863
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:27,189
He's at the home of

864
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:29,828
a former hooker, Manou Berliner,

865
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,831
in the 16th district.

866
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,752
Check it out
and stay on his ass.

867
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:36,628
I want all his moves
and who he sees.

868
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:40,198
What are you waiting for?

869
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:44,270
I ran you a bath,
then I'll go shopping.

870
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:45,475
I'll be off, too.

871
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:49,389
Don't you move.
Stay here and rest.

872
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:53,310
It's weird to have you here.

873
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:57,280
- I won't bother you long.
- You're no bother.

874
01:22:58,680 --> 01:22:59,476
On the contrary.

875
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:04,152
Christo'll turn in his grave!

876
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,673
A cop in his bathtub!

877
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:10,475
At the end, he was unrecognizable.

878
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,192
He barely weighed 80 lbs.

879
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:19,598
His car's still in the garage.
You can use it.

880
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:21,988
For anything else,

881
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:25,511
you know this place,
feel at home.

882
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,719
- What's it about?
- I'm here to see Titi Brasseur.

883
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:01,315
- Who are you?
- Leo Vrinks.

884
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:13,870
He's OK!

885
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:17,875
It's not classy, but there's free
booze and lots of ass.

886
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:20,514
Still see the old bunch?

887
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,399
Not a one.

888
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:28,032
What'll you do now?

889
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:32,596
No idea.

890
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:44,594
Besides Klein,
who saw Camille's death?

891
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,034
No one knows.

892
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:52,073
No one talked,
it was all hushed up.

893
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:54,708
Those who didn't blab
got promoted.

894
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:59,150
Only the Verhagen chick
got left behind.

895
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:00,469
Where's she now?

896
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:03,592
Cop shop in the sticks.

897
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:05,639
On the complaints desk.

898
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:07,989
In Gennevilliers.

899
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:17,113
I'll be off.

900
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:20,799
Too crowded, too noisy.

901
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:23,639
I'm out of practice.

902
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:41,156
- I'm sorry.
- You creep!

903
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:43,595
- Apologize to my wife.
- He didn't.

904
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:46,115
- Yes, I did.
- No, you didn't!

905
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:47,874
Who are you shitting?

906
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:59,074
Lay off him! Asshole!

907
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:02,835
Don't touch me!

908
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,149
You're a goner!

909
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:16,309
Sorry.

910
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:17,674
You know him?

911
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:18,870
No, why?

912
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:25,429
We've seen that creep before.

913
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:27,109
I'm sure of it.

914
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:30,359
Take good care.

915
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:59,233
<i>Don't let her by!</i>

916
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:06,596
<i>No one knows why Silien shot her!</i>

917
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,471
<i>We heard a shot, the car skidded,</i>

918
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:11,550
<i>he shot at us,</i>

919
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:13,355
<i>we fired back.</i>

920
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:16,953
<i>I only want one version.</i>

921
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:31,472
You knew about Camille?

922
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:37,874
What could I do?

923
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:44,988
Leo, wait!

924
01:27:58,080 --> 01:27:58,751
That's him.

925
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:07,828
- Up already?
- I couldn't sleep.

926
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:14,709
There's cops parked below.

927
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:15,835
I saw them.

928
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:18,395
Why are they there?

929
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:20,796
They were told to be there.

930
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:24,390
<i>Policemen's Ball at City Hall</i>

931
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:28,870
I need a gun.

932
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:37,196
By when?

933
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:41,313
By Friday.

934
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:34,114
Took you long enough.

935
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:57,311
When did you get out?

936
01:29:57,840 --> 01:29:59,239
2 days ago.

937
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:03,119
You waited 2 days
before coming to see me?

938
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:04,918
I waited...

939
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:08,551
for the right moment.

940
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:12,673
It's hard to return to the living.

941
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:18,838
Some day, explain it to me.

942
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:21,913
Some day...

943
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:27,273
Why didn't you let me visit you in jail?

944
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:35,829
I was afraid.

945
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:37,556
Of what?

946
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:42,870
Watching you leave each time.

947
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:31,349
Call me tomorrow?

948
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:33,235
I promise.

949
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:36,274
Lola...

950
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:42,395
That story isn't quite over.

951
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:45,717
There's a last thing to settle.

952
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:48,119
Then I'll have to leave.

953
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:50,759
Where to?

954
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:52,872
I don't know. Far away.

955
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:55,958
Don't dump me twice.

956
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:18,074
Night. See you Saturday.

957
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:34,757
Who are those assholes?

958
01:32:58,720 --> 01:32:59,470
<i>War booty.</i>

959
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:01,995
Fuck, that's Bruno's shiv!

960
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:08,236
Were you on thatjunket?

961
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:13,638
Answer, who else was along?

962
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:15,235
Who was with you?

963
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:18,675
Who's that?

964
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:24,993
That's a cop...

965
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:35,950
Your friend is brain-dead.

966
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:39,753
He'll stay that way
till he's unplugged.

967
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:50,509
<i>Shit, what ya doin'?</i>

968
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:53,399
<i>Who the fuck are you?</i>
<i>What have I done?</i>

969
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:56,750
Lt. Eve Verhagen, please.

970
01:33:57,880 --> 01:34:00,997
It's Vrinks. I'm at Evry hospital.

971
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:04,236
Titi got beat up, he's in a coma.

972
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:06,190
For good.

973
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:10,590
Care to know who did it?

974
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:50,514
Don't go, Leo.

975
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:54,318
It's the only thing to do.

976
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:00,833
Call you when it's done.

977
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:13,239
What's he up to?

978
01:35:19,120 --> 01:35:20,712
Badges and guns on the dash.

979
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:26,515
Get out.

980
01:35:33,240 --> 01:35:34,434
In the trunk.

981
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:36,637
Get in.

982
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:38,392
This is dumb, Vrinks.

983
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:41,593
Get in. Hurry!

984
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:46,113
Good evening.
Thank you for coming so numerous

985
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:50,033
to this very special event
that honors

986
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:53,359
all of you, who through
your generosity...

987
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:50,959
Congratulations, Klein.

988
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:12,311
Only the dead don't return.

989
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:17,233
Don't look around.

990
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:21,039
So you see your face
explode in the mirror.

991
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:27,591
How could you have shot her?

992
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:33,957
I could've forgotten everything.

993
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:35,993
But not that.

994
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:37,633
<i>Don't let her by!</i>

995
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,718
<i>Don't let her by, dammit!</i>

996
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:47,151
She was already dead.

997
01:38:51,480 --> 01:38:53,675
<i>No one knows why Silien shot her.</i>

998
01:39:13,160 --> 01:39:15,469
If you miss yourself with the first,

999
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:19,115
there's 13 more in the clip.

1000
01:40:07,720 --> 01:40:08,550
Fuck you!

1001
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:11,310
You hear me, Vrinks!

1002
01:40:12,440 --> 01:40:13,873
Go fuck yourself!

1003
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:17,120
You hear? She died

1004
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:20,631
because of you!
Only because of you!

1005
01:40:21,320 --> 01:40:23,550
You're the one who fucked up!

1006
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:28,154
If you'd left us alone

1007
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:30,231
it never would've happened!

1008
01:40:32,680 --> 01:40:33,669
You hear me,

1009
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:35,479
you dirty fucker!

1010
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:37,035
You hear?

1011
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:37,916
Klein?

1012
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:39,991
- What?
- Remember me?

1013
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:55,710

1014
01:40:57,760 --> 01:40:58,909

No, just the candy.
