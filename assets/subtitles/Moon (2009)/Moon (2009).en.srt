00:00:38,782 --> 00:00:41,195
These violent delight

2
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:42,295
were abrupt endings

3
00:00:43,984 --> 00:00:45,965
And in their triumph

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,963
as wires and dust less and that ..

5
00:00:49,062 --> 00:00:50,678
who, when they kiss ...

6
00:00:51,597 --> 00:00:52,883

New Moon (Bagong BUWAN)

00:01:27,066 --> 00:01:28,098
Grandma?

10
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,879
Edward, no! ... You will see!

11
00:01:57,729 --> 00:01:58,716
Well.

12
00:02:09,888 --> 00:02:11,453
Grandma, I want you to meet him ...

13
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:43,085
In many years, Bella.

14
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:57,624
In many years.

15
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,784
Father, we understand
that without gifts.

16
00:03:03,926 --> 00:03:07,076
Mine is not even packed.

17
00:03:07,077 --> 00:03:08,209
So do not count.

18
00:03:11,341 --> 00:03:13,331
In fact, it's really cool.

19
00:03:13,366 --> 00:03:14,235
Thanks, Dad.

20
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,875
Comes with it,
of the mother.

21
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,737
We coordinated ...

22
00:03:18,772 --> 00:03:20,797
In fact, she coordinated Me Me.

23
00:03:22,582 --> 00:03:25,239
As you put pictures in it,

24
00:03:25,274 --> 00:03:26,738
to remember your graduation year.

25
00:03:28,606 --> 00:03:30,893
Class 12-A.

26
00:03:30,928 --> 00:03:32,417
How did you grow so fast?

27
00:03:32,452 --> 00:03:34,698
I have grown so much.

28
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:35,964
I do not know what to say.

29
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:37,340
Is that somehow the white hair?

30
00:03:38,168 --> 00:03:39,889
No. No way.

31
00:03:43,111 --> 00:03:44,841
Happy Birthday.

32
00:03:44,876 --> 00:03:46,796
Very funny.

33
00:03:46,831 --> 00:03:51,273
<i>Another Tripper  disappeared.
Total is 3 and presumed dead,</i>

34
00:03:51,308 --> 00:03:53,482
while police searches
killer animal

35
00:03:58,677 --> 00:04:00,223
Hi, Bella. Bella ...

36
00:04:00,224 --> 00:04:01,898
- Hi.
- Hi.

37
00:04:04,108 --> 00:04:05,749
Bella, this is the big day.

38
00:04:06,911 --> 00:04:08,636
Teaching Essay
about "Romeo and Juliet"?

39
00:04:08,637 --> 00:04:10,214
Yes.

40
00:04:10,215 --> 00:04:12,546
"Where are you, Bella?

41
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:15,894
I want to take a picture.
Mom wants

42
00:04:15,929 --> 00:04:18,649
to have an album full of souvenirs.

43
00:04:18,684 --> 00:04:20,667
I take photos, not how the picture.

44
00:04:20,702 --> 00:04:22,083
Yes, today you do.

45
00:04:22,118 --> 00:04:24,006
I will change the nose in Photoshop
If it seems too much, right?

46
00:04:24,284 --> 00:04:26,508
No where, I appear in pictures.
Nobody will look at you.

47
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:31,903
Good. It's Cullen.

48
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,237
Speak later.

49
00:04:59,877 --> 00:05:00,707
happy Birthday!!.

50
00:05:00,742 --> 00:05:01,660
I do not get remembered.

51
00:05:04,252 --> 00:05:06,765
Your day of birth is certainly
a cause for celebration.

52
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:09,536
- And if not older.
- you are aging?

53
00:05:12,024 --> 00:05:14,851
At 18 years is a little early
Report worry for your age.

54
00:05:14,894 --> 00:05:16,565
Are one year older than you.

55
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,292
I did not.
Bella, I am 109 years

56
00:05:19,327 --> 00:05:22,640
Can not be
to go out with a old man.

57
00:05:22,675 --> 00:05:26,540
Sick ...
I should be disgusted.

58
00:05:38,032 --> 00:05:39,684
We have to go in time.

59
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:41,516
Well.

60
00:05:45,108 --> 00:05:45,997
Wait a second.

61
00:05:48,178 --> 00:05:49,815
Someone looking for you.

62
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:50,892
Bella!

63
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:57,081
- Jacob, what ...
- I leave to speak.

64
00:06:01,827 --> 00:06:06,607
How long bicep!
To know that steroids are really bad for you!

65
00:06:06,608 --> 00:06:08,926
Go to end to form, Bella.

66
00:06:08,984 --> 00:06:12,173
You would not jump so much in the eye
If we see more often ..

67
00:06:12,923 --> 00:06:14,782
We should exchange schools

68
00:06:14,817 --> 00:06:16,129
You could come to stay
with faces pale.

69
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:17,257
I'm alright.

70
00:06:17,292 --> 00:06:19,449
I prefer exclusivity
School of rezervaþie.

71
00:06:19,484 --> 00:06:22,421
Here let anyone through in this place.

72
00:06:22,456 --> 00:06:24,712
I see.
Why are you here?

73
00:06:24,747 --> 00:06:26,955
I came to buy a piece
for VW's Rabbit.

74
00:06:27,244 --> 00:06:30,146
you Need to take a ride next time


75
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,428
It's faster?

76
00:06:31,463 --> 00:06:35,480
umm.. Its decent. .. 

77
00:06:39,731 --> 00:06:40,803
hey..
happy birthday!

78
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,974
Your father told her dad. So ...

79
00:06:44,975 --> 00:06:45,838
Yeah, sure.

80
00:06:47,475 --> 00:06:50,671
I saw him yesterday and I thought of you.

81
00:06:52,113 --> 00:06:53,437
Chase away bad dreams and you.

82
00:06:55,353 --> 00:06:57,812
E. .. perfect.

83
00:06:59,648 --> 00:07:00,915
Thank you.

84
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,848
No problem.

85
00:07:05,762 --> 00:07:07,188
- I am glad I saw.
- Yes, later.

86
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:11,918
Why Jacob Black Do you can do
a gift and I do not?

87
00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:16,032
Because I have not
Why would you give to you.

88
00:07:17,936 --> 00:07:20,074
Bella, you give me everything
only exists in the world.

89
00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:25,620
I see. Thank you.
That's all I want.

90
00:07:25,655 --> 00:07:26,062
Bella!

91
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,237
Happy Birthday!

92
00:07:29,238 --> 00:07:30,333
Ssshhh..

93
00:07:32,963 --> 00:07:34,261
Alice, I said
I do not want gifts?

94
00:07:34,296 --> 00:07:37,800
I have seen opening it
and guess what? He loved it!

95
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:40,330
You will wear to party tonight
at home.

96
00:07:42,425 --> 00:07:45,710
Common Please? It will be fun.

97
00:07:48,989 --> 00:07:50,842
ok... All right.

98
00:07:50,877 --> 00:07:53,112
Super! See you at 7:00!

99
00:07:55,714 --> 00:07:57,399
Wait, Jasper ...

100
00:07:57,434 --> 00:07:59,380
Controls are not yet well.

101
00:08:00,075 --> 00:08:01,771
I'm sorry, Bella.

102
00:08:01,806 --> 00:08:05,372
Happy! Let ...

103
00:08:07,741 --> 00:08:09,533
You can not trust vampires.

104
00:08:10,568 --> 00:08:11,735
Trust me.

105
00:08:12,348 --> 00:08:15,142
<i> My love! My wife </ i></i>

106
00:08:15,177 --> 00:08:16,922
<i> your death has drank
dulceaþa rãsuflãrii ...</ i></i>

107
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:37,309
Poor Romeo ...

108
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:40,599
And killed the great love
of pure stupidity.

109
00:08:40,723 --> 00:08:43,291
Yes.

110
00:08:43,326 --> 00:08:45,487
Although one thing to envy.

111
00:08:48,368 --> 00:08:52,690
Juliet is perfect ... if you like
a beauty so blatantly.

112
00:08:56,633 --> 00:09:00,414
No girl - suicide.

113
00:09:03,573 --> 00:09:10,702
It's almost impossible for ... some.

114
00:09:12,362 --> 00:09:17,331
But for people ... Little poison,

115
00:09:17,366 --> 00:09:19,465
stuck a dagger in the heart.

116
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,429
Have many options.

117
00:09:26,778 --> 00:09:29,065
Why you say so what?

118
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:32,514
I once went through my head.

119
00:09:34,631 --> 00:09:36,208
I did not know if I find the time.

120
00:09:37,266 --> 00:09:40,872
I must have ... plan.

121
00:09:42,336 --> 00:09:43,930
What was the plan?

122
00:09:44,144 --> 00:09:45,665
He and be taken to Italy,

123
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,855
he and provoked the Volturi ...

124
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:48,926
Who?

125
00:09:48,961 --> 00:09:51,050
On the Volturi.

126
00:09:51,085 --> 00:09:57,358
Want to repeþi last reply
as you were to look closely, Mr Cullen?

127
00:10:00,314 --> 00:10:01,827
Yes, sir.

128
00:10:05,812 --> 00:10:09,255
<i>Here  my bed and I tarnished the latter </ i></i>

129
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:13,202

( "Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare,
trans. L. Leviþchi)

137
00:10:32,106 --> 00:10:33,919
Look at the screen, people.

138
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,418
Volturi family is very old

139
00:10:43,453 --> 00:10:44,978
and very strong.

140
00:10:45,013 --> 00:10:47,886
I like some kings of my world.

141
00:10:47,921 --> 00:10:51,421
That is ... Carlisle?

142
00:10:51,456 --> 00:10:55,309
Yes. He was survived by her
few decades.

143
00:10:55,472 --> 00:10:57,656
He described as very rafinaþi.

144
00:10:57,691 --> 00:11:00,326
They have no respect
for human life, of course.

145
00:11:00,361 --> 00:11:04,419
But even compliance arts, sciences ...

146
00:11:05,447 --> 00:11:07,403
and laws.

147
00:11:09,011 --> 00:11:10,548
Above all laws.

148
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:15,823
Vampires have laws?

149
00:11:17,126 --> 00:11:18,903
Not many.

150
00:11:20,094 --> 00:11:22,772
Only one is ... imperative.

151
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,993
What?

152
00:11:27,576 --> 00:11:30,773
Secrecy to our existence.

153
00:11:30,808 --> 00:11:34,388
Im not exit the track

154
00:11:36,459 --> 00:11:39,039
and not kill in public

155
00:11:42,999 --> 00:11:44,666
... if you do not want to be killed and I.

156
00:11:59,404 --> 00:12:01,207
Not even ... You are not talking about it.

157
00:12:01,242 --> 00:12:05,703
I can not conceive
to your hurt someone.

158
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:12,878
Bella, the only one who can hurt me
are you.

159
00:12:13,892 --> 00:12:16,692
What else can I fear?

160
00:12:16,727 --> 00:12:18,221
Not true.

161
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,736
Victory will come after me
someday.

162
00:12:24,006 --> 00:12:29,004
But Alice will predict the decisions.
And I'll be ready.

163
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,792
I can defend myself.

164
00:12:32,256 --> 00:12:33,578
If I turned ...

165
00:12:34,614 --> 00:12:37,072
No. You already protect me ...

166
00:12:38,146 --> 00:12:44,904
You're my only reason ...
to stay alive.

167
00:12:44,939 --> 00:12:46,541
If I can call it that.

168
00:12:48,441 --> 00:12:50,965
But the mission is to protect you

169
00:12:54,513 --> 00:12:56,881
by anyone,

170
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,553
In addition to my sister.

171
00:12:58,588 --> 00:13:01,242
Time! Time! Time!

172
00:13:11,844 --> 00:13:13,350
I apologize.

173
00:13:13,385 --> 00:13:15,296
I have tried to mollify Alice.

174
00:13:15,331 --> 00:13:16,705
As if you have such.

175
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,419
In many years, Bella.

176
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,379
Thank you.

177
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:24,573
I found your bag.

178
00:13:24,608 --> 00:13:25,509
Is it possible?

179
00:13:25,544 --> 00:13:27,465
You're with a girl more than you.

180
00:13:27,538 --> 00:13:28,959
Sexy!

181
00:13:30,072 --> 00:13:31,071
What?

182
00:13:35,026 --> 00:13:38,461
It's a necklace. Alice chose him.

183
00:13:38,462 --> 00:13:39,835
Thank you.

184
00:13:42,816 --> 00:13:44,707
To see how loved you!

185
00:13:47,843 --> 00:13:50,448
Look, this is from Emmett.

186
00:13:52,318 --> 00:13:54,793
Already we have installed in your truck.

187
00:13:55,556 --> 00:13:57,710
Finally, a decent sound system
the piece that ...

188
00:13:57,745 --> 00:13:59,759
I do not speak ill truck.

189
00:13:59,794 --> 00:14:02,080
Open the one
from Esme and Carlisle.

190
00:14:03,613 --> 00:14:06,229
Something to brighten your day.

191
00:14:06,264 --> 00:14:08,576
I saw a little pale
lately.

192
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,094
I cut the paper.

193
00:14:43,468 --> 00:14:44,380
Jaz ...

194
00:14:45,537 --> 00:14:49,821
Never mind.
It's just a drop of ... blood.

195
00:14:56,514 --> 00:14:58,693
Get him on Jasper from here.

196
00:15:03,996 --> 00:15:06,879
Sorry ... I can ...

197
00:15:06,914 --> 00:15:10,973
Will have to kick
in my office.

198
00:15:13,552 --> 00:15:15,942
See what is Jasper.

199
00:15:16,925 --> 00:15:18,528
I think it's very angry with himself and

200
00:15:18,529 --> 00:15:20,306
and I think not listen
by anyone except you now.

201
00:15:21,634 --> 00:15:22,879
Edward.

202
00:15:34,138 --> 00:15:36,242
I know how to spoil a party.

203
00:15:36,277 --> 00:15:40,699
Not your fault. Jasper has not renounced

204
00:15:40,734 --> 00:15:42,923
the blood of man as long as we do.

205
00:15:44,934 --> 00:15:46,786
It seems that only you are not affected.

206
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,469
I have years and years of practice behind.

207
00:15:49,504 --> 00:15:51,664
Have you ever ...

208
00:15:51,699 --> 00:15:54,218
to prefer the easier method?

209
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,731
No.
I knew who I want to be.

210
00:15:59,766 --> 00:16:03,620
I wanted to help people,
it makes me happy.

211
00:16:03,655 --> 00:16:05,914
Even be cursed.

212
00:16:07,402 --> 00:16:12,860
Cursed?
That is the ... Hell?

213
00:16:19,314 --> 00:16:21,508
Carlisle, can not be cursed.

214
00:16:22,951 --> 00:16:24,358
It's like, is impossible.

215
00:16:24,852 --> 00:16:26,634
Thank you, Bella.

216
00:16:27,518 --> 00:16:31,889
Always have been ...
benevolent with us.

217
00:16:34,722 --> 00:16:38,302
So that's the reason?
Is that not like to make?

218
00:16:41,144 --> 00:16:43,538
If that were reversed,

219
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:48,597
if you have the same beliefs
as Edward

220
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:51,770
you could deprive the soul?

221
00:17:14,881 --> 00:17:18,348
I can not protect.

222
00:17:19,257 --> 00:17:20,765
Not much.

223
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,627
At one point,
something separated us.

224
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:28,997
It will be an accident, illness ...

225
00:17:30,104 --> 00:17:31,486
or bãtrâneþea ...

226
00:17:32,491 --> 00:17:34,596
as long as I am human.

227
00:17:35,256 --> 00:17:37,866
And the only solution
is to transform me.

228
00:17:39,364 --> 00:17:42,554
This is not a solution.
But a tragedy.

229
00:17:42,589 --> 00:17:44,881
You will not like me
when you look like a bunicuþã.

230
00:17:54,970 --> 00:18:01,004
Bella does not understand how I feel about you?
Not?

231
00:18:01,917 --> 00:18:12,474
Carlisle told me what you think
your soul, but I do not think ...

232
00:18:13,516 --> 00:18:15,727
So no worry to me.

233
00:18:16,784 --> 00:18:19,310
Should enter the house.

234
00:18:33,095 --> 00:18:35,751
Still is my birthday.

235
00:18:38,878 --> 00:18:41,583
Can I ask your something?

236
00:18:44,312 --> 00:18:47,315
Kiss me.

237
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:19,319
I love you.

238
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,154
And I.

239
00:20:44,292 --> 00:20:45,424
Hi.

240
00:20:49,084 --> 00:20:52,607
Come with me.

241
00:21:15,368 --> 00:21:17,933
Had to leave Forks.

242
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:22,496
Why?

243
00:21:25,523 --> 00:21:28,480
Carlisle should have
ten years longer than it looks.

244
00:21:29,273 --> 00:21:31,801
People started noticing.

245
00:21:34,004 --> 00:21:35,740
Welcome ... I ...

246
00:21:36,505 --> 00:21:40,499
We need to think of an explanation
for Charlie ...

247
00:21:50,086 --> 00:21:52,238
When you say "we" ...

248
00:21:56,174 --> 00:21:58,927
I refer to my
and the family.

249
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:06,878
Edward, what happened
with Jasper was nothing.

250
00:22:06,913 --> 00:22:08,417
You're right.

251
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,266
It was nothing.

252
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:14,587
Nothing more than work
to which I always expected.

253
00:22:17,182 --> 00:22:19,857
Nothing in addition what could happen.

254
00:22:25,748 --> 00:22:28,354
Your place is not in my world.

255
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:36,018
My place is with you.

256
00:22:38,034 --> 00:22:40,318
No. Not the and a.

257
00:22:42,622 --> 00:22:43,809
Come with you ...

258
00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:50,468
Bella ... I do not want to come!

259
00:22:56,798 --> 00:22:59,976
Do not you want me?

260
00:23:04,131 --> 00:23:05,967
No.

261
00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:13,435
This change things ...
well.

262
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:16,575
But, if not Do you ask too much,

263
00:23:18,254 --> 00:23:20,935
I can even promise you?

264
00:23:23,167 --> 00:23:25,276
Do not do any foolish act.

265
00:23:27,904 --> 00:23:29,996
For Charlie's sake.

266
00:23:31,949 --> 00:23:34,055
Do you And I promise you one thing,
instead.

267
00:23:34,086 --> 00:23:37,057
Now I see the last time.

268
00:23:38,471 --> 00:23:40,195
I will return.

269
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:43,448
And you Do you will be able to continue life
without any interference from me.

270
00:23:45,237 --> 00:23:49,313
Do you swear like I will be
not and never existed.

271
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:56,095
If you do it for my soul, take it!
Do not want if you do not have you.

272
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:57,529
This is not about your soul.

273
00:24:00,592 --> 00:24:04,236
You are not good for me.

274
00:24:05,455 --> 00:24:07,567
Not good enough
for you.

275
00:24:07,602 --> 00:24:10,896
I regret only that I left
too long and things of a.

276
00:24:10,931 --> 00:24:13,404
Please ...

277
00:24:15,772 --> 00:24:16,872
not ...

278
00:24:21,518 --> 00:24:24,139
Goodbye.

279
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,020
Edward!

280
00:24:52,743 --> 00:24:53,840
Edward!

281
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,353
Edward!

282
00:25:03,088 --> 00:25:04,277
Edward?

283
00:27:08,741 --> 00:27:10,205
I will call back to Cullen family.

284
00:27:11,843 --> 00:27:14,096
They left the city, Charlie.

285
00:27:14,131 --> 00:27:15,182
Good riddance.

286
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:16,678
Where did they go?

287
00:27:17,665 --> 00:27:19,746
We will find, Charlie.

288
00:27:19,781 --> 00:27:21,795
Thanks, Harry.

289
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:22,803
Charlie!

290
00:27:22,838 --> 00:27:28,571
Good.

291
00:27:29,937 --> 00:27:30,965
I have it.

292
00:27:32,415 --> 00:27:33,484
Thanks, Sam.

Well. Ready.

309
00:30:11,604 --> 00:30:12,951
What?

310
00:30:12,986 --> 00:30:14,009
You go in Jacksonville

311
00:30:14,044 --> 00:30:16,577
that you are living with your mother.

312
00:30:17,987 --> 00:30:20,191
Do not leave the Forks.

313
00:30:21,115 --> 00:30:26,841
Bells, not return.

314
00:30:29,046 --> 00:30:30,857
I know.

315
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,600
This is not normal behavior.

316
00:30:34,635 --> 00:30:38,707
And, frankly, scares us
me and your mother.

317
00:30:40,493 --> 00:30:43,850
Honey, I ...
I do not want to go, but ...

318
00:30:43,851 --> 00:30:46,513
Go to Jacksonville.

319
00:30:46,548 --> 00:30:47,865
Do your some new friends.

320
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,223
I like my old friends.

321
00:30:49,258 --> 00:30:50,947
But you never see them.

322
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:52,975
Yes.

323
00:30:58,221 --> 00:31:01,201
In fact, me and Jessica go tomorrow
shopping.

324
00:31:02,114 --> 00:31:03,656
You hate are to go shopping.

325
00:31:03,691 --> 00:31:08,005
We have to go out with girls.

326
00:31:10,682 --> 00:31:13,684
Well. Exit with the girls.

327
00:31:13,685 --> 00:31:16,258
Shopping.

328
00:31:16,259 --> 00:31:21,398
I like.
Go to ... buy things.

329
00:31:30,045 --> 00:31:31,358
Hi, Jessica. I'm Bella ...

330
00:31:31,393 --> 00:31:33,897
Yes, Bella Swan.

331
00:31:39,546 --> 00:31:42,378
I do not know what you like to see
As zombies kill innocent people

332
00:31:42,379 --> 00:31:45,289
and not to any type pupãm with nice ...
It's disgusting.

333
00:31:46,425 --> 00:31:48,274
Do not understand why there are so many
zombie movies.

334
00:31:48,572 --> 00:31:50,603
E parallelism for leprosy?

335
00:31:50,604 --> 00:31:52,759
My cousin had leprosy
and not fun.

336
00:31:54,638 --> 00:31:57,213
It's a kind of metaphor
and excessive consumption or something?

337
00:31:57,214 --> 00:32:00,831
Stop umflaþi both birds
although with your teptãciunea.

338
00:32:01,765 --> 00:32:04,548
Some girls like to shop.
Not everyone, apparently.

339
00:32:05,342 --> 00:32:06,898
I was surprised and that you called.

340
00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:11,267
Do you understand depression.
I am very worried.

341
00:32:11,268 --> 00:32:14,821
I wonder if you have problems.
And I have been through enough.

342
00:32:14,822 --> 00:32:16,275
PETE CHIORU '

343
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,609
Like when Mike was decided
to be "just friends"?

344
00:32:18,644 --> 00:32:20,553
It was very hard and i. ..

345
00:32:32,864 --> 00:32:34,321
 move, Bella. 

346
00:32:34,322 --> 00:32:37,319
 is dangerous. 

347
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:48,082
Come on.

348
00:32:53,748 --> 00:32:55,611
I think ... ã them know the guys knew.

349
00:32:59,414 --> 00:33:01,659
Seem very "nice".
Can we go?

350
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,452
I want to see something.

351
00:33:12,173 --> 00:33:14,431
Move to, is a chef to come.

352
00:33:15,719 --> 00:33:17,200
 Come back. 

353
00:33:40,089 --> 00:33:41,709
I'm sorry.
I got confused ...

354
00:33:41,744 --> 00:33:43,609
Never mind. I will be
whoever you want, doll.

355
00:33:44,576 --> 00:33:47,789
What?

356
00:33:51,912 --> 00:33:53,985
You promised that you will not be imprudent. 

357
00:33:57,983 --> 00:34:01,372
You promised to be like
not have ever existed.

358
00:34:06,304 --> 00:34:08,066
You lied.

359
00:34:08,067 --> 00:34:11,440
You said something, love?
You know what? No matter.

360
00:34:28,467 --> 00:34:30,377
Stops. Stops! Stops!

361
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:45,177
What the hell's the big idea?
I just ... curious.

362
00:34:47,229 --> 00:34:48,532
I saw something.

363
00:34:48,567 --> 00:34:53,471
You're crazy. Or suicide door.

364
00:34:53,472 --> 00:34:56,595
That guy could be a psychopath.

365
00:34:56,596 --> 00:35:00,587
He was to arrive in the interrogation room
as in the television series.

366
00:35:01,991 --> 00:35:05,559
What sensation hard!

367
00:35:05,594 --> 00:35:08,268
What now are dependent of adrenaline?

368
00:35:08,303 --> 00:35:09,923
Go to do jumping rope ...

369
00:35:09,924 --> 00:35:12,462
Get on the engine
any missed some.

370
00:35:12,463 --> 00:35:13,693
Madness!

371
00:35:18,432 --> 00:35:20,921
<i> Alice, I've seen. </ i></i>

372
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:25,492
<i> Maybe I lost our minds.
I do not care.

373
00:35:28,113 --> 00:35:32,837
<i>If the danger is  need to see,
then we find him alone. </ i></i>

374
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:42,040
Where the hell have you been?

375
00:35:47,518 --> 00:35:49,014
I brought you something.

376
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:52,428
This is crazy.

377
00:35:58,088 --> 00:36:00,340
Old beasts. There was no need.

378
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:02,773
I have saved from landfill.

379
00:36:05,249 --> 00:36:07,972
It cost more than I do
to fix them ...

380
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:12,399
if we somehow a friend
driver ....

381
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,811
I was engineer friend?

382
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:19,563
Since you like motorcycles to you?

383
00:36:19,598 --> 00:36:20,949
For now.

384
00:36:25,622 --> 00:36:30,055
Understand perfectly if you think it's
stupid and a reckless.

385
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:32,705
Clearly is nuts
and a reckless.

386
00:36:35,494 --> 00:36:36,946
When you begin?

387
00:36:41,522 --> 00:36:43,333
Now!

388
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:45,463
- Please!
- Okay.

389
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:51,766
Wait!
I really ... heavy.

390
00:36:57,098 --> 00:37:01,963
Jake, you're strong!
And you only have 16 years. Do not know.

391
00:37:01,964 --> 00:37:05,391
Age is just a number.
How many years have you? 40?

392
00:37:09,823 --> 00:37:11,212
Sometimes I feel so.

393
00:37:22,299 --> 00:37:24,380
That song is move to.
Do not you like?

394
00:37:26,229 --> 00:37:29,929
Not much I still love music.

395
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:31,834
- In a way ...
- Okay.

396
00:37:31,835 --> 00:37:33,771
No more music.

397
00:37:36,652 --> 00:37:40,242
If we work at it every day,
and hope to do,

398
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:44,254
we should do and some themes.

399
00:37:44,289 --> 00:37:46,755
Billy I do not want to believe
I have a bad influence on you.

400
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:48,669
Influence you help me?

401
00:37:48,704 --> 00:37:49,791
Please.

402
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:55,345
Are greater than you.

403
00:37:55,346 --> 00:37:58,684
So I'm the one that affect
and you are not influenced.

404
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:04,504
Knowledge I do
to be greater than you.

405
00:38:04,604 --> 00:38:06,695
Your lack of understanding
any.

406
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:09,116
I convinced you we do in secret
I and two inãrii on two wheels of death.

407
00:38:09,184 --> 00:38:11,403
Do not think it looks
that are rather small and a little naive?

408
00:38:12,301 --> 00:38:14,892
Well. So how do we?

409
00:38:15,657 --> 00:38:17,287
I have 35 years ...

410
00:38:17,288 --> 00:38:19,700
and you no 32.

411
00:38:19,735 --> 00:38:20,661
Come ...

412
00:38:20,696 --> 00:38:21,625
Jake, are you there?

413
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,175
Nothing, my friends.

414
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:24,232
Hey, Jake ...

415
00:38:24,267 --> 00:38:26,249
Hi. This is Bella.

416
00:38:26,284 --> 00:38:28,666
Bella, they are Quilez and Embry.

417
00:38:28,667 --> 00:38:31,097
I Quiletaire.

418
00:38:33,707 --> 00:38:35,267
So the story engines
true.

419
00:38:35,268 --> 00:38:37,524
Yes. I learned everything I know.

420
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:39,936
And from that you are
girlfriend?

421
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:43,389
We are just friends.

422
00:38:43,424 --> 00:38:44,885
Tough.

423
00:38:45,912 --> 00:38:49,260
I said it girl
and that is my friend.

424
00:38:49,295 --> 00:38:50,813
Embry, Do you remember
that we would be shown the difference?

425
00:38:50,848 --> 00:38:51,641
No.

426
00:38:51,676 --> 00:38:54,043
So understand that I have friends.
Hard!

427
00:38:55,699 --> 00:38:57,259
Sure.

428
00:38:57,294 --> 00:38:59,250
Quilez came summers and time at the ball.

429
00:38:59,285 --> 00:39:01,629
Yes, it still makes me laugh.

430
00:39:01,664 --> 00:39:02,669
Want to hear something funny, Black?

431
00:39:02,704 --> 00:39:03,840
Do you tell me one hard.

432
00:39:08,386 --> 00:39:09,597
I bet five U.S. dollars on Quilez.

433
00:39:09,632 --> 00:39:10,904
You got it.

434
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:40,588
<i> I would like to we who speak ...
I'd like to tell you about Jake ...</ i></i>

435
00:39:40,623 --> 00:39:43,937
<i> makes me feel better. </ i></i>

436
00:39:43,938 --> 00:39:47,537
<i> mean ... makes me feel alive. </ i></i>

437
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:51,850
<i> goal of my chest ...</ i></i>

438
00:39:53,126 --> 00:39:55,470
<i> when Jake, </ i></i>

439
00:39:55,471 --> 00:39:57,813
<i>I feel like 
would be almost healed ...</ i></i>

440
00:39:57,814 --> 00:39:59,533
<i> for a while. </ i></i>

441
00:40:00,368 --> 00:40:02,283
Quilez'm still wondering
and if he can come.

442
00:40:02,318 --> 00:40:04,080
I think you like least about much.

443
00:40:06,451 --> 00:40:09,083
Tell him you do not like
boys smaller than me.

444
00:40:12,584 --> 00:40:14,267
What will all þii up and hard with age?

445
00:40:15,033 --> 00:40:18,513
Cullen How many years have, anyway?

446
00:40:20,704 --> 00:40:23,005
<i>Even Jacob  fails and you
to hold the basket marurile remote ...</ i></i>

447
00:40:34,775 --> 00:40:38,084
Nothing, Bells. You're right.

448
00:40:49,597 --> 00:40:51,682
Beginning to think that
this thing has an effect,

449
00:40:51,683 --> 00:40:54,881
but apparently not the and a.

450
00:41:00,408 --> 00:41:01,981
Can I ask you something?

451
00:41:02,468 --> 00:41:06,351
Do you spend time with Jacob?

452
00:41:07,629 --> 00:41:10,995
He thought for a while
He may still.

453
00:41:16,555 --> 00:41:22,500
Sometimes you have to learn to love you
What Do you do well.

454
00:41:23,761 --> 00:41:25,075
You know what I speak.

455
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,132
Of course, you know me?

456
00:41:30,381 --> 00:41:32,879
I'm just a bachelor
the terminal.

457
00:41:34,979 --> 00:41:36,955
A smoothie recognized.

458
00:41:36,956 --> 00:41:40,872
Well.

459
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:44,754
Go to sleep again.

460
00:41:46,846 --> 00:41:48,146
I love you.

461
00:41:54,001 --> 00:41:58,567
If your saying you can not fix
motorcycles, what would you say?

462
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:03,389
I doubt the skill are you?

463
00:42:04,056 --> 00:42:04,920
No.

464
00:42:04,921 --> 00:42:08,079
Of course not.
We can do.

465
00:42:08,114 --> 00:42:09,953
Just ...

466
00:42:11,331 --> 00:42:15,096
If I were to wait,
may have less time and be held.

467
00:42:19,173 --> 00:42:24,778
If I said you can not fix
I would say it's a shame,

468
00:42:24,779 --> 00:42:28,488
but would have
to find something else to do.

469
00:42:33,583 --> 00:42:35,036
That does not e. .. Sat Uley?

470
00:42:35,071 --> 00:42:38,546
Yes. Download "sect" of.

471
00:42:41,644 --> 00:42:45,604
God!

472
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:47,309
Have you seen this?

473
00:42:53,728 --> 00:42:55,863
Not really fight, Bella.

474
00:42:55,898 --> 00:42:57,685
Jump on the rock in water.

475
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,631
E înfrico and ATOR like hell,
but it's a beastly sensation!

476
00:43:03,408 --> 00:43:04,578
A sensation beast?

477
00:43:04,613 --> 00:43:06,057
Most
jump below.

478
00:43:06,092 --> 00:43:09,511
Sat only and "disciples" of
children are given above.

479
00:43:11,574 --> 00:43:14,109
You got something against them?

480
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,670
I do not know.

481
00:43:17,705 --> 00:43:20,089
They think masters here.

482
00:43:20,124 --> 00:43:24,688
Embry told "bãtãu and umflaþi
of steroids "and now look at him.

483
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:28,826
- Is that Embry?
- Yes.

484
00:43:28,861 --> 00:43:30,289
What pãþit?

485
00:43:30,324 --> 00:43:32,543
He missed some time from school.

486
00:43:32,578 --> 00:43:36,283
Then, suddenly reappeared
in GA and that of Sam, and as a cãþelu.

487
00:43:36,598 --> 00:43:39,038
Just have pãþit Paul and Jared.

488
00:43:39,776 --> 00:43:46,907
And Sam still look at me,
like I would expect, somehow.

489
00:43:48,227 --> 00:43:51,010
I start a little scared.

490
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,223
Would have to eviþi.

491
00:43:55,244 --> 00:43:57,813
Trying ...

492
00:44:18,635 --> 00:44:20,683
- Ccžeii afraid?
- Yes.

493
00:44:22,068 --> 00:44:22,986
Well.

494
00:44:23,508 --> 00:44:25,471
- Fran?
- This.

495
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:31,305
Clutch? Well.

496
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:32,847
Supply?

497
00:44:35,546 --> 00:44:36,642
Are you ready?

498
00:44:38,646 --> 00:44:41,115
Doors URELIT ... disengages the clutch.

499
00:44:41,116 --> 00:44:44,373
<i><b>  Bella. </ b> </ i></b></i>

500
00:44:47,662 --> 00:44:48,720
<i><b>  stops you. </ b> </ i></b></i>

501
00:44:54,513 --> 00:44:55,543
You're okay?

502
00:44:56,849 --> 00:44:58,486
Try again.

503
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:20,358
Put brakes!

504
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:36,090
I want to try again.

505
00:45:36,125 --> 00:45:37,623
Trying to commit suicide?

506
00:45:37,624 --> 00:45:40,147
- Try again.
- Forget it.

507
00:45:41,154 --> 00:45:43,103
No longer allowed to ride.

508
00:45:43,863 --> 00:45:46,965
Your head ...

509
00:45:49,133 --> 00:45:50,954
God, I'm sorry.

510
00:45:51,818 --> 00:45:53,852
Do you apologize you bleeding?

511
00:45:57,211 --> 00:45:58,975
A and a. .. appears.

512
00:45:59,725 --> 00:46:01,286
It's just blood, Bella.

513
00:46:01,287 --> 00:46:03,257
No big deal.

514
00:46:15,623 --> 00:46:17,094
What you forget long?

515
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:23,032
You're just ... nice.

516
00:46:30,594 --> 00:46:33,168
How hard did you hit your head?

517
00:46:38,067 --> 00:46:39,838
Let's go.

518
00:46:43,462 --> 00:46:46,267
- I really saw something in the forest.
- Sure, you think.

519
00:46:46,302 --> 00:46:48,698
I did not.
He wants to stick it in bed.

520
00:46:51,853 --> 00:46:54,183
A wild beast, enormous.

521
00:46:54,218 --> 00:46:56,072
In four paws was higher than
a man.

522
00:46:56,073 --> 00:46:58,093
Maybe it was a bear?

523
00:46:58,094 --> 00:47:00,268
Or an alien.
Luckily you had not taken anything.

524
00:47:03,852 --> 00:47:04,772
I've seen.

525
00:47:04,773 --> 00:47:06,374
There are only.

526
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,808
Father receives all sorts of reports
to the department.

527
00:47:09,809 --> 00:47:12,926
Five are excursion were killed and
of a bear.

528
00:47:12,927 --> 00:47:15,194
I think you found the bear.

529
00:47:19,021 --> 00:47:20,971
It's the last time you will
bend of my friend, bufonului.

530
00:47:25,965 --> 00:47:29,396
So? I mean ...
Bella is back!

531
00:47:33,301 --> 00:47:35,428
Yes, I think so.

532
00:47:35,429 --> 00:47:37,026
Welcome!

533
00:47:38,964 --> 00:47:42,668
Listen, now you're here,
words are ...

534
00:47:42,669 --> 00:47:44,434
and eat again ...

535
00:47:44,435 --> 00:47:48,428
You know you, more put some
protein in the body ...

536
00:47:50,336 --> 00:47:54,410
I was wondering if you would like
to go to a movie with me.

537
00:47:58,552 --> 00:48:00,090
Yeah, sure.

538
00:48:00,091 --> 00:48:01,308
I.

539
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:09,147
Well ... I can see
"Spelled backwards is Amor Amor".

540
00:48:09,148 --> 00:48:11,582
It's a stupid title, but ...

541
00:48:11,583 --> 00:48:14,117
is a romantic comedy
or so would be ...

542
00:48:14,118 --> 00:48:18,269
Without romantic movies ...

543
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:22,671
Go to "punch in the face".
Heard of him?

544
00:48:22,672 --> 00:48:27,216
- It's an action movie.
- Yes, it's perfect.

545
00:48:29,155 --> 00:48:32,593
Weapons, adrenaline ...
I love it.

546
00:48:32,594 --> 00:48:33,819
Well.

547
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:36,802
You should call the world in May.
Want to go to see ...

548
00:48:36,803 --> 00:48:40,069

549
00:48:40,104 --> 00:48:44,348

551
00:48:52,145 --> 00:48:55,419
So going to "punch in the face"?
Do you like action movies?

552
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:57,795
Not really.

553
00:49:01,683 --> 00:49:04,287
I heard it's born PA. Sorry.

554
00:49:05,689 --> 00:49:08,209
You're big enough
like to see this movie?

555
00:49:09,921 --> 00:49:11,507
Without adult supervision?

556
00:49:11,508 --> 00:49:14,344
Yes, I buy the ticket.

557
00:49:16,771 --> 00:49:18,036
Jessica holds us fold

558
00:49:18,071 --> 00:49:20,704
and Angela has gastroenteritis,
So Erik takes care of it.

559
00:49:22,798 --> 00:49:24,459
- I was just us three.
- Great!

560
00:49:26,031 --> 00:49:27,117
Wonderful.

561
00:49:33,065 --> 00:49:35,611
<i> I kid!
I'll rip cãpãþâna </ i></i>

562
00:49:35,612 --> 00:49:39,720
<i> Leave your weapons!
I will rip cãpãþânile both </ i></i>

563
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:43,781
<i> Welcome! Let's do </ i></i>

564
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:03,679
Well, I think I throw up.

565
00:50:10,264 --> 00:50:13,167
- Jesus.
- What pãmpãlãu!

566
00:50:14,939 --> 00:50:17,607
Should you'd expect
anyone more courageous.

567
00:50:18,443 --> 00:50:21,596
Someone who laughs at the carnage
on the screen.

568
00:50:21,597 --> 00:50:23,873
Yes, I þin eyes open and I.

569
00:50:26,063 --> 00:50:29,798
I feel funny.
Circulating flu that ...

570
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:35,018
What?
Þin you not allowed to hand?

571
00:50:36,154 --> 00:50:37,396
Sure you can.

572
00:50:40,957 --> 00:50:45,372
Just ... for you means nothing
than for me.

573
00:50:46,899 --> 00:50:48,764
Can you tell me?

574
00:50:48,765 --> 00:50:49,921
Like me, do you?

575
00:50:55,467 --> 00:50:57,747
And you seem to be ... nice?

576
00:51:01,883 --> 00:51:03,431
Jake, do not do that.

577
00:51:09,625 --> 00:51:10,713
Why?

578
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:16,393
Because you will destroy everything.

579
00:51:18,707 --> 00:51:19,797
And I. ..

580
00:51:20,701 --> 00:51:22,217
i need you.

581
00:51:28,071 --> 00:51:29,823
I have a lot of time
to disposal.

582
00:51:29,824 --> 00:51:33,061
I will not give up.

583
00:51:34,955 --> 00:51:36,619
I do not want to do.

584
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:38,551
But ...

585
00:51:38,552 --> 00:51:41,729
just because I do not want
not going anywhere.

586
00:51:45,517 --> 00:51:47,733
They are very selfish.

587
00:51:51,268 --> 00:51:53,823
And not like a car
that one can fix.

588
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:02,079
I will not change,
so we should be fair with you.

589
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:06,538
Because of him, right?

590
00:52:17,691 --> 00:52:22,022
Look, you know what he did.

591
00:52:24,283 --> 00:52:29,833
And, Bella, I do not and never has your
so something.

592
00:52:31,628 --> 00:52:34,124
I will not never hurt.
You a promise.

593
00:52:34,125 --> 00:52:37,509
I will not disappoint.

594
00:52:38,898 --> 00:52:40,525
You can count on me.

595
00:52:54,919 --> 00:52:56,454
I must return home.

596
00:53:03,826 --> 00:53:06,366
I'm very sorry
I stay in the film.

597
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:12,014
What is the problem?

598
00:53:12,049 --> 00:53:13,453
You are the problem.

599
00:53:14,186 --> 00:53:16,898
If you feel sick, maybe they should
to go to the hospital.

600
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:20,574
You want to snap
until you get into a hospital?

601
00:53:20,575 --> 00:53:23,102
Jake, Jake, are you?

602
00:53:24,738 --> 00:53:27,336
You're very hot.

603
00:53:29,211 --> 00:53:30,867
As if you have fever.
You're okay?

604
00:53:32,657 --> 00:53:34,496
I do not know what happens.

605
00:53:37,162 --> 00:53:38,618
I have to go.

606
00:53:44,106 --> 00:53:45,796
That guy is weird.

607
00:53:49,108 --> 00:53:50,116
<i> Hi, Jake. </ i></i>

608
00:53:50,151 --> 00:53:52,105
<i> Your father said you mononucleosis. </ i></i>

609
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:53,523
<i> not left me to come visit, </ i></i>

610
00:53:53,558 --> 00:53:55,191
<i> but can you call me? </ i></i>

611
00:54:01,011 --> 00:54:03,215
<i> All I am ...</ i></i>

612
00:54:03,216 --> 00:54:06,171
<i>Sorry 
what I said at the cinema. </ i></i>

613
00:54:08,811 --> 00:54:11,489
<i> I just wanted to hear your voice.
Not pressure you. </ I></i>

614
00:54:14,951 --> 00:54:18,977
Jacob. Please. Call me.

615
00:54:20,901 --> 00:54:22,297
Well. We go on at 3 ...

616
00:54:31,547 --> 00:54:33,349
No need
to go fishing today ...

617
00:54:33,384 --> 00:54:35,359
Yes.

618
00:54:35,394 --> 00:54:38,887
No, go. What are you?
Just take care.

619
00:54:39,982 --> 00:54:41,346
Always have.

620
00:54:43,157 --> 00:54:46,656
Ur and prove them that I'm not, Bella.
"Kung-fu" is my power.

621
00:55:20,925 --> 00:55:21,757
Jake!

622
00:55:29,381 --> 00:55:30,931
Are you cut?

623
00:55:34,149 --> 00:55:35,807
And you have tattooed?

624
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:42,017
- Bella ...
- I thought you are too ill to exit!

625
00:55:44,267 --> 00:55:46,463
Answer the phone
when you call.

626
00:55:48,251 --> 00:55:49,465
Go.

627
00:55:50,887 --> 00:55:51,677
What?

628
00:55:53,789 --> 00:55:54,923
Go.

629
00:55:56,985 --> 00:55:59,526
What you pãþit?
What ... Hey!

630
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:01,915
What happened?

631
00:56:04,431 --> 00:56:07,055
Sam got to you?
That happened?

632
00:56:07,056 --> 00:56:09,299
Sat trying to help me.

633
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,425
Do not învinovãþi him.

634
00:56:11,426 --> 00:56:13,867
If you want to blame someone,

635
00:56:13,868 --> 00:56:17,267
look at that blood drinkers
împuþiþi whom you love.

636
00:56:17,268 --> 00:56:19,151
Cullen family.

637
00:56:25,862 --> 00:56:29,004
- I do not know what words are.
- You know exactly what I speak.

638
00:56:29,005 --> 00:56:36,050
I've lied to everyone. Charlie ...
But me I can not lying.

639
00:56:39,136 --> 00:56:41,427
Jacob!

640
00:56:48,185 --> 00:56:49,529
Look, Bella ...

641
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:52,455
We can not be friends.

642
00:56:54,113 --> 00:56:57,866
Jake, I know I hurt ...

643
00:56:59,441 --> 00:57:01,053
Kill me!

644
00:57:01,054 --> 00:57:02,872
Kill me!

645
00:57:04,885 --> 00:57:08,417
- Give me time or ...
- Yes.

646
00:57:10,737 --> 00:57:12,100
Are you not to blame.

647
00:57:15,252 --> 00:57:16,717
"There are you to blame but me, right?

648
00:57:16,718 --> 00:57:17,973
Really?

649
00:57:18,983 --> 00:57:21,525
It's true.
I am to blame.

650
00:57:24,025 --> 00:57:26,651
There are ... good.

651
00:57:29,191 --> 00:57:32,709
I was.

652
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:35,077
But no longer.

653
00:57:35,078 --> 00:57:38,104
Does not really matter, do you?

654
00:57:38,105 --> 00:57:40,191
It is over.

655
00:57:40,192 --> 00:57:42,047
You can not separated from me.

656
00:57:44,545 --> 00:57:45,958
I mean ...

657
00:57:45,959 --> 00:57:48,721
You're the best friend.

658
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:53,067
You promised.

659
00:57:53,068 --> 00:57:55,896
I know.

660
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:59,332
I promised that I will not hurt,
Bella.

661
00:57:59,333 --> 00:58:02,421
And now I promise þin.

662
00:58:03,337 --> 00:58:07,354
Go home.
And never come back.

663
00:58:07,355 --> 00:58:10,005
Or you get hurt.

664
00:58:23,422 --> 00:58:29,380
<i> Alice, things ...
Things are bad again. </ I></i>

665
00:58:31,725 --> 00:58:35,364
<i>Without  Jake, can not endure. </ i></i>

666
00:58:38,089 --> 00:58:39,851
<i> not see him Edward. </ i></i>

667
00:58:42,007 --> 00:58:44,723
<i> I do not feel
that has ever existed. </ i></i>

668
00:58:42,007 --> 00:58:44,723
<i> I do not feel
that has ever existed. </ i></i>

669
00:58:52,263 --> 00:58:54,896
<i> I find that place
that I will be again. </ i></i>

670
00:59:52,967 --> 00:59:54,114
Laurent?

671
00:59:56,162 --> 00:59:58,104
I'm not expected to find you here.

672
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:02,383
I went to visit the Cullen,

673
01:00:02,418 --> 01:00:05,125
but their house was empty.

674
01:00:07,325 --> 01:00:09,419
I'm surprised that you have left here.

675
01:00:10,173 --> 01:00:14,262
There were ...
'their pet?

676
01:00:15,771 --> 01:00:17,333
Something like that.

677
01:00:17,368 --> 01:00:20,414
Cullen family
often comes to visit?

678
01:00:25,125 --> 01:00:26,081
<i><b>  Mind it. </ b> </ i></b></i>

679
01:00:31,486 --> 01:00:32,921
Absolutely. All the time.

680
01:00:32,956 --> 01:00:34,261
<i><b>  him lying better. </ b> </ i></b></i>

681
01:00:34,296 --> 01:00:36,448
I will say that you stopped by.

682
01:00:38,104 --> 01:00:41,559
Probably should not ...

683
01:00:42,531 --> 01:00:44,199
Edward.

684
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:46,354
Because he wants too much
protect me.

685
01:00:46,389 --> 01:00:48,782
But it's far, do you?

686
01:00:51,323 --> 01:00:52,914
Why are you here?

687
01:00:53,785 --> 01:00:57,898
I returned
I do a service to Victoria.

688
01:01:00,839 --> 01:01:01,583
Victoria.

689
01:01:01,618 --> 01:01:05,803
I called to see if there are
the Cullen family protection.

690
01:01:06,448 --> 01:01:08,842
Victory seems as
to kill his partner Edward

691
01:01:10,348 --> 01:01:11,762
if he killed her and your comrades.

692
01:01:11,797 --> 01:01:13,382
Eye for an eye ...

693
01:01:14,572 --> 01:01:15,586
<i><b>  threatens it. </ b> </ i></b></i>

694
01:01:15,621 --> 01:01:17,213
Edward you are who did it.

695
01:01:17,248 --> 01:01:19,030
It comes after both.

696
01:01:20,308 --> 01:01:21,884
I do not think she will.

697
01:01:23,446 --> 01:01:25,340
What importance do you have for him

698
01:01:26,188 --> 01:01:29,151
if you had left here, without defense?

699
01:01:31,694 --> 01:01:33,874
Victoria will not enjoy
I will kill you.

700
01:01:34,934 --> 01:01:36,894
But I can not abþine.

701
01:01:37,352 --> 01:01:39,514
Miro and to let my mouth water.

702
01:01:39,549 --> 01:01:41,676
Please, no.
We have helped ...

703
01:01:44,083 --> 01:01:44,928
No, no, no. Fear not.

704
01:01:44,963 --> 01:01:47,139
It's a gesture of kindness.

705
01:01:47,174 --> 01:01:49,592
Victoria and I had planned to kill you slowly,

706
01:01:51,489 --> 01:01:52,740
painful ...

707
01:01:53,898 --> 01:01:55,562
while I will be very soon.

708
01:01:55,597 --> 01:01:57,450
Do you promise.

709
01:01:58,818 --> 01:02:00,466
You will not feel anything.

710
01:02:06,256 --> 01:02:07,842
<i><b>  Edward, help me. </ b> </ i></b></i>

711
01:03:18,999 --> 01:03:20,286
Dad? I've seen!

712
01:03:20,934 --> 01:03:21,802
What happened?

713
01:03:21,837 --> 01:03:23,925
In forest. No ur and I.

714
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:24,909
How that is the forest?

715
01:03:24,944 --> 01:03:27,470
Bella, what the hell is the forest?

716
01:03:27,505 --> 01:03:29,996
They are wolves.
That is, some huge and wolves!

717
01:03:30,727 --> 01:03:32,193
Are you sure, Bella?

718
01:03:32,228 --> 01:03:33,464
Yes. I just saw.

719
01:03:33,499 --> 01:03:36,116
Were taken after ... something.

720
01:03:36,151 --> 01:03:37,814
Wolves?

721
01:03:38,958 --> 01:03:39,704
I've seen?

722
01:03:43,331 --> 01:03:44,625
Well, then ...

723
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:47,988
Harry, you feel like a hunting?

724
01:03:48,023 --> 01:03:49,686
You can collect some guys?

725
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,689
Sure. Yes. I will ...

726
01:03:54,890 --> 01:03:57,008
<i> I know wolves are dead. </ i></i>

727
01:03:58,172 --> 01:04:00,371
<i>And  Laurent will be told
that are defenseless. </ i></i>

728
01:04:01,276 --> 01:04:02,463
<i> Victoria. </ i></i>

729
01:04:04,276 --> 01:04:05,759
Should I go to the department.

730
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:08,009
Father!
It should ... to go.

731
01:04:09,027 --> 01:04:10,803
You can stay in the house?

732
01:04:35,982 --> 01:04:37,048
Bella.

733
01:04:40,263 --> 01:04:42,435
You scared me.
What are you doing?

734
01:04:42,585 --> 01:04:43,740
Fere and get it. URC.

735
01:05:00,845 --> 01:05:03,305
Look, I'm sorry.

736
01:05:09,343 --> 01:05:10,498
Why?

737
01:05:10,533 --> 01:05:14,587
I wish to explain your.
But ... can not, literally.

738
01:05:23,769 --> 01:05:26,681
Have you ever had a secret
that you do not and anybody can share?

739
01:05:28,012 --> 01:05:29,831
One that you do not have the right
it mean?

740
01:05:33,587 --> 01:05:35,347
He and the E for me.

741
01:05:36,135 --> 01:05:37,597
But worse.

742
01:05:38,983 --> 01:05:42,759
Nor do you know ...
how closely they are related.

743
01:05:43,517 --> 01:05:47,125
This ...
I do not like what you have done.

744
01:06:02,275 --> 01:06:04,593
What kills me is that you already know.

745
01:06:09,381 --> 01:06:13,902
Bella, Do you remember when we
walked on the beach in La Push ...

746
01:06:21,030 --> 01:06:25,643
The story ...
The story about "The Cold".

747
01:06:28,454 --> 01:06:31,617
Understand if this is the only part
that you remember it.

748
01:06:39,333 --> 01:06:41,292
There must be something ...

749
01:06:41,327 --> 01:06:42,869
what you can do ...

750
01:06:43,229 --> 01:06:44,935
No. It's a lifetime commitment.

751
01:06:46,673 --> 01:06:48,158
Maybe I should run away from here
a while.

752
01:06:48,785 --> 01:06:50,134
To leave.

753
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:52,328
Only two of us.

754
01:06:53,319 --> 01:06:54,825
You do that?

755
01:06:57,822 --> 01:06:59,451
A and do it for you.

756
01:07:06,154 --> 01:07:08,625
Not a thing
You can, simply, run.

757
01:07:10,456 --> 01:07:11,987
But it and do it.

758
01:07:12,782 --> 01:07:14,866
A and run with you ...

759
01:07:18,189 --> 01:07:19,847
if I could.

760
01:07:23,801 --> 01:07:26,384
I have to go.
They begin to wonder where they are.

761
01:07:31,215 --> 01:07:32,780
Come here.

762
01:07:37,365 --> 01:07:41,168
Please.
Try to remember your.

763
01:07:42,685 --> 01:07:46,836
It would be much simpler
if you are.

764
01:07:50,282 --> 01:07:54,119
Try, but ... Jake ...
Jake, what are you doing?

765
01:07:54,154 --> 01:07:55,905
Wait, Jake.

766
01:08:03,376 --> 01:08:04,448
Jake ...

767
01:08:21,415 --> 01:08:23,121
Well, are scared.

768
01:08:23,156 --> 01:08:25,508
<i><b>A   and to and should. </ b> </ i></b></i>

769
01:08:52,813 --> 01:08:53,721
Bella?

770
01:08:53,756 --> 01:08:55,256
Need to see.

771
01:08:56,995 --> 01:08:58,391
Not here.

772
01:09:00,290 --> 01:09:01,667
I'm sorry,
you really need to see.

773
01:09:01,668 --> 01:09:02,797
Bella?

774
01:09:19,434 --> 01:09:21,040
What you did?

775
01:09:21,041 --> 01:09:23,753
What you did?
What have you done?

776
01:09:23,754 --> 01:09:24,774
Doors URELIT.

777
01:09:24,775 --> 01:09:27,351
- Don and wanted it!
- What have I done? What did he?

778
01:09:27,386 --> 01:09:28,250
What you said?

779
01:09:28,251 --> 01:09:29,880
Both, calmaþi sure.

780
01:09:29,881 --> 01:09:31,624
I did not say anything
for they were afraid of you!

781
01:09:38,212 --> 01:09:39,974
- Now it's too late.
- Bella, back!

782
01:09:42,878 --> 01:09:44,218
Chill immediately.

783
01:09:52,254 --> 01:09:53,516
Bella!

784
01:09:55,125 --> 01:09:55,831
Run!

785
01:09:59,063 --> 01:10:00,451
Jake, run!

786
01:10:39,593 --> 01:10:41,303
Jake, take her home to Bella Emily.

787
01:10:43,139 --> 01:10:44,683
I think the wolf to exit it from the couch.

788
01:10:50,609 --> 01:10:54,253
Alice is as possible
everything to be true?

789
01:10:54,288 --> 01:10:56,631
Fairy tales and horror stories?

790
01:10:56,666 --> 01:11:01,067
It may not be anything "healthy"
and "normal"?

791
01:11:03,144 --> 01:11:04,785
You should go back,
to ensure that Jacob is good.

792
01:11:04,820 --> 01:11:06,526
I hope Paul and stick to-dinþii in it.

793
01:11:06,561 --> 01:11:07,660
Let him teach me.

794
01:11:07,695 --> 01:11:08,561
No way.

795
01:11:08,596 --> 01:11:09,435
Jake is a born fighter.

796
01:11:09,470 --> 01:11:10,688
You saw how quickly?

797
01:11:10,723 --> 01:11:12,316
Make $ 5 that Paul did not attain.

798
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:15,322
Come, Bella.
Do not about muscle.

799
01:11:16,206 --> 01:11:17,596
Speaks only in your name.

800
01:11:28,653 --> 01:11:30,186
Speaking of Emily, Sam's fiancée.

801
01:11:30,221 --> 01:11:31,436
Try not one regards are fixed.

802
01:11:31,471 --> 01:11:32,388
It bothers Sam.

803
01:11:34,898 --> 01:11:36,229
Why watch and a price?

804
01:11:36,264 --> 01:11:38,072
You hungry?

805
01:11:38,107 --> 01:11:39,764
As if we have to wonder.

806
01:11:47,299 --> 01:11:48,348
Who is?

807
01:11:48,383 --> 01:11:50,484
Bella Swan. Who else?

808
01:11:53,438 --> 01:11:55,820
So you are girl-vampire.

809
01:11:59,023 --> 01:12:01,362
And you are ... girl-wolf.

810
01:12:01,397 --> 01:12:04,920
A and to think.

811
01:12:04,955 --> 01:12:06,426
"Front-wolf".

812
01:12:06,461 --> 01:12:07,886
I am only engaged to one.

813
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:12,596
May you leave something and for your brothers.

814
01:12:12,597 --> 01:12:14,715
And ladies are first.

815
01:12:14,716 --> 01:12:15,924
Want an honors you?

816
01:12:15,925 --> 01:12:18,295
Sure. Thank you.

817
01:12:18,362 --> 01:12:21,384
Only Jacob was able to avoid
law of silence imposed by Sat.

818
01:12:22,245 --> 01:12:23,947
He did not say anything or ...

819
01:12:23,982 --> 01:12:25,650
This is something the wolves.

820
01:12:25,685 --> 01:12:27,954
Alfa's orders are heard,
we do not want.

821
01:12:27,955 --> 01:12:30,722
And be careful:
We hear the thoughts between us.

822
01:12:30,757 --> 01:12:32,366
Why not shut up now?

823
01:12:32,367 --> 01:12:34,438
These are secret, damn!

824
01:12:34,439 --> 01:12:36,778
This chick is întovãrã and e and you
with vampires!

825
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:39,914
Not much I întovãrã and esc with them.

826
01:12:42,892 --> 01:12:44,300
There are too fast.

827
01:12:44,301 --> 01:12:47,659
- Yes?
- We are iuþi and more.

828
01:12:47,694 --> 01:12:50,296
Are you scared yet?

829
01:12:52,448 --> 01:12:54,668
You are not our first mon
that I have met.

830
01:12:54,971 --> 01:12:55,974
Jake is right.

831
01:12:56,009 --> 01:12:57,568
You got to ciudãþenii.

832
01:13:20,212 --> 01:13:21,461
I apologize.

833
01:13:35,954 --> 01:13:37,302
So are werewolves.

834
01:13:39,732 --> 01:13:42,020
Yes. From what I know.

835
01:13:44,286 --> 01:13:46,603
Several members of "lucky and" the tribe
have the gene.

836
01:13:47,695 --> 01:13:51,628
When the city are drinking blood,
Master and we get a fever.

837
01:13:54,146 --> 01:13:55,201
Mononucleosis.

838
01:13:56,403 --> 01:13:58,674
Yes. I wish I.

839
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:06,403
I can not find a way to ...
stop you are?

840
01:14:08,312 --> 01:14:11,072
I mean ... sucks.

841
01:14:12,978 --> 01:14:14,820
There is a particular lifestyle,
Bella.

842
01:14:14,821 --> 01:14:17,402
A and the I was born, I have no choice.

843
01:14:18,730 --> 01:14:19,859
You're such a hypocrite!

844
01:14:19,867 --> 01:14:21,749
What, are kind of monster
for you?

845
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:23,809
The problem is not what you are.

846
01:14:23,810 --> 01:14:25,668
But what you do.

847
01:14:26,318 --> 01:14:28,106
They did not harm anyone.

848
01:14:29,956 --> 01:14:31,535
You have killed people, Jake.

849
01:14:31,570 --> 01:14:33,716
Bella, we did not kill anyone.

850
01:14:35,997 --> 01:14:37,324
Then who does?

851
01:14:37,359 --> 01:14:39,760
Those that try new
to defend yourself.

852
01:14:40,688 --> 01:14:42,354
The only ones that really kill it:

853
01:14:44,988 --> 01:14:46,514
vampires.

854
01:14:48,226 --> 01:14:49,082
Jake, can not ...

855
01:14:49,117 --> 01:14:51,814
No care, we can achieve
I cut the preþio and Cullen

856
01:14:52,533 --> 01:14:53,847
if it does not violate the Treaty.

857
01:14:53,882 --> 01:14:55,430
Not what I wanted ...

858
01:14:56,732 --> 01:14:58,304
You can not kill vampires.

859
01:14:58,339 --> 01:15:00,742
They will kill you.

860
01:15:01,828 --> 01:15:04,849
Really? I killed the leech codiþe
pretty easy.

861
01:15:09,497 --> 01:15:10,560
Laurent?

862
01:15:10,595 --> 01:15:12,642
And his girlfriend how much red
s next.

863
01:15:14,098 --> 01:15:15,184
The day is here?

864
01:15:15,602 --> 01:15:17,982
Was. I watched one last night
up to the border with Canada.

865
01:15:18,437 --> 01:15:21,048
But it all comes back.
I'd like to know you are looking ...

866
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:23,116
I know what he wants.

867
01:15:26,629 --> 01:15:27,800
Me.

868
01:15:36,715 --> 01:15:39,485
Do not worry.
November guard this place.

869
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:42,249
It will move you
or Charlie.

870
01:15:43,545 --> 01:15:44,860
Care must be taken.

871
01:15:44,861 --> 01:15:48,003
It's quick.
You do not know what hot e.

872
01:15:48,004 --> 01:15:50,947
To know that your distrust toward new
is kind of offensive.

873
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:55,443
Well. You should go.

874
01:15:56,973 --> 01:15:58,345
You must go.

875
01:15:58,969 --> 01:16:00,191
Yes.

876
01:16:01,389 --> 01:16:03,573
I killed a vampire.

877
01:16:17,543 --> 01:16:19,888
<i> Alice, are good. </ i></i>

878
01:16:21,403 --> 01:16:22,999
<i>Until  be alone. </ i></i>

879
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,129
<i> And lately,
This happens all the time. </ i></i>

880
01:16:27,415 --> 01:16:29,541
<i> Jacob left.
A hunt in Victoria. </ I></i>

881
01:16:30,141 --> 01:16:31,771
<i>And Charlie  hunt him Jacob. </ i></i>

882
01:16:32,674 --> 01:16:33,840
<i> I you have gone ...</ i></i>

883
01:16:34,024 --> 01:16:36,991
<i> And Edward. </ i></i>

884
01:16:40,788 --> 01:16:43,290
<i> Now there e. .. nothing. </ i></i>

885
01:16:46,370 --> 01:16:47,096
Find anything, Harry?

886
01:16:49,705 --> 01:16:51,195
Nothing.

887
01:16:58,883 --> 01:17:02,246
<i>Anyway  would have to go,
any would have to make to see again ...</ i></i>

888
01:20:01,363 --> 01:20:03,019
<i><b>  not do that. </ b> </ i></b></i>

889
01:20:07,888 --> 01:20:09,660
You wanted to be a simple man.

890
01:20:12,307 --> 01:20:13,748
Look me.

891
01:20:16,685 --> 01:20:17,924
<i><b>  Please. </ b> </ i></b></i>

892
01:20:17,925 --> 01:20:19,906
<i><b>  for me. </ b> </ i></b></i>

893
01:20:19,941 --> 01:20:21,718
I have no other way
to keep you near me.

894
01:20:25,659 --> 01:20:28,279
<i><b>  Bella, please ...</ b> </ i></b></i>

895
01:21:52,133 --> 01:21:56,256
Breathe.

896
01:21:58,228 --> 01:21:59,609
Breathe!

897
01:21:59,805 --> 01:22:02,750
Come on, Bella, breathe!

898
01:22:11,752 --> 01:22:13,198
Bella? You hear me?

899
01:22:19,099 --> 01:22:20,210
... Jake?

900
01:22:29,045 --> 01:22:30,588
What the hell was in your mind?

901
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:33,994
I had ... to see ... something.

902
01:22:33,995 --> 01:22:37,995
Send her home!
Go to Harry, help!

903
01:22:41,878 --> 01:22:43,230
What happened to Harry?

904
01:22:44,012 --> 01:22:46,180
Harry Clearwater
suffered a heart attack.

905
01:22:47,434 --> 01:22:49,702
Charlie and my father are both there,
with his family.

906
01:22:49,737 --> 01:22:51,138
Harry will be fine?

907
01:22:53,145 --> 01:22:54,894
He died.

908
01:22:58,808 --> 01:23:01,802
Do you will find something dry dressed
and you'll go home.

909
01:23:13,613 --> 01:23:15,098
Here are 43 degrees.

910
01:23:20,350 --> 01:23:22,216
God! I have frozen hands.

911
01:23:24,174 --> 01:23:26,004
I think it's nice
do not you are never cold.

912
01:23:27,068 --> 01:23:28,912
It is a characteristic of wolves.

913
01:23:28,947 --> 01:23:32,712
I did not.
It is a characteristic of Jacob.

914
01:23:32,747 --> 01:23:35,118
You are ... hot.

915
01:23:37,561 --> 01:23:39,802
The sun.

916
01:23:43,844 --> 01:23:47,703
It's better, now that you know about me.

917
01:23:49,350 --> 01:23:51,509
But ...

918
01:23:57,164 --> 01:23:59,570
You saw what he pãþit Emily.

919
01:24:03,033 --> 01:24:04,872
Sat was furious ...

920
01:24:05,429 --> 01:24:08,040
and lost control
only a fraction of a second ...

921
01:24:08,075 --> 01:24:11,138
Emily was too close.

922
01:24:13,627 --> 01:24:16,080
Will never
move to-and act.

923
01:24:18,939 --> 01:24:20,944
If I angry at you?

924
01:24:32,346 --> 01:24:38,373
Sometimes I feel ... that will disappear.

925
01:24:44,561 --> 01:24:50,283
You can not expect
to tell you so something.

926
01:24:52,401 --> 01:24:55,319
But always will.
You will lose yourself.

927
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:00,730
Do not let it happen.

928
01:25:08,138 --> 01:25:11,754
Do you always say you

929
01:25:13,854 --> 01:25:16,224
how special you are.

930
01:25:35,762 --> 01:25:39,394
Thank you for everything.

931
01:25:44,794 --> 01:25:45,625
Wait.

932
01:25:48,632 --> 01:25:50,030
There is a vampire.

933
01:25:50,065 --> 01:25:51,383
How you know?

934
01:25:52,695 --> 01:25:54,838
I feel stink.
I take from here.

935
01:25:56,881 --> 01:25:58,320
It's Carlisle's car!

936
01:25:59,761 --> 01:26:01,601
I'm here.

937
01:26:01,636 --> 01:26:02,905
Bella! It's a trick!

938
01:26:02,940 --> 01:26:05,076
Wait. You must come with me.

939
01:26:08,707 --> 01:26:09,965
I will not hurt.

940
01:26:10,454 --> 01:26:12,852
If Cullen is a return here,
This falling back into their territory.

941
01:26:14,294 --> 01:26:16,788
Treaty says that we can defend
only their own land.

942
01:26:16,823 --> 01:26:18,541
- There can no longer protect.
- Okay.

943
01:26:18,542 --> 01:26:19,903
Never mind.
No need to do.

944
01:26:23,293 --> 01:26:24,585
You're about to pass
over a boundary.

945
01:26:24,620 --> 01:26:26,349
Then assign you one.

946
01:26:26,350 --> 01:26:28,035
Please.

947
01:26:45,425 --> 01:26:46,484
Alice!

948
01:26:46,485 --> 01:26:49,136
- God!
- Bella!

949
01:26:49,137 --> 01:26:52,674
I'm sorry.
I can not believe you're here!

950
01:26:54,782 --> 01:26:57,000
Will you explain how are alive?

951
01:26:58,479 --> 01:26:59,308
What?

952
01:26:59,343 --> 01:27:01,127
I had a vision with you,

953
01:27:01,162 --> 01:27:02,751
You jumped off a cliff.

954
01:27:03,943 --> 01:27:05,747
Why the hell you did
to commit suicide?

955
01:27:05,782 --> 01:27:07,145
What about Charlie?
What about ...

956
01:27:07,180 --> 01:27:08,509
I did that.

957
01:27:10,132 --> 01:27:11,452
The rock salt in water.

958
01:27:11,487 --> 01:27:12,830
So I can say.

959
01:27:13,376 --> 01:27:14,801
It was ... funny.

960
01:27:17,146 --> 01:27:18,508
I've never met anyone

961
01:27:18,543 --> 01:27:21,075
with an angle so the idioþenii
which to put life in danger.

962
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:30,713
- You say?
- Yes.

963
01:27:33,047 --> 01:27:35,867
He sounds just once
a few months.

964
01:27:37,309 --> 01:27:39,165
He said he wanted to be alone.

965
01:27:45,869 --> 01:27:48,751
Bella, what's that smell repugnant
wet dog?

966
01:27:52,105 --> 01:27:53,679
Probably comes from me.

967
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:57,610
S of Jacob.

968
01:27:57,611 --> 01:27:59,196
What Jacob?

969
01:28:01,110 --> 01:28:03,168
Jacob is a kind of werewolf.

970
01:28:04,826 --> 01:28:09,190
Bella, it's good to întovãrã and are
with vârcolacii.

971
01:28:09,225 --> 01:28:10,884
Speaks only in your name.

972
01:28:16,161 --> 01:28:17,934
I had to make sure
you're safe.

973
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:21,482
I thought I can not defend here.

974
01:28:22,804 --> 01:28:24,432
I think I do not care.

975
01:28:28,292 --> 01:28:29,772
I will not be sorry.

976
01:28:31,872 --> 01:28:33,496
No, you are just a harmless Cullen.

977
01:28:33,497 --> 01:28:35,408
I'm talking about the other
drinking blood.

978
01:28:35,409 --> 01:28:37,269
He tried to kill Bella
because of you.

979
01:28:37,270 --> 01:28:38,549
Victoria?

980
01:28:38,550 --> 01:28:40,484
Yes, Victoria was around here.

981
01:28:40,485 --> 01:28:41,899
I saw it.

982
01:28:43,138 --> 01:28:45,298
Or that you were
removed from the water.

983
01:28:47,664 --> 01:28:50,626
I can see you
the pack and your dog.

984
01:28:50,627 --> 01:28:52,752
Not ... I'm angry.

985
01:28:52,753 --> 01:28:55,214
- Stop. Ending, Ending.
- Things are very ugly exit.

986
01:29:03,308 --> 01:29:04,746
We let a moment.

987
01:29:12,437 --> 01:29:15,492
Do not go anywhere.
You get back, okay?

988
01:29:15,493 --> 01:29:17,275
Once Scotland dog of the house.

989
01:29:27,007 --> 01:29:28,142
He ...

990
01:29:32,349 --> 01:29:33,143
Longer and others?

991
01:29:33,144 --> 01:29:34,969
Cullen How many are there
and how long they stay?

992
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:40,166
Just Alice.

993
01:29:44,803 --> 01:29:46,589
And I can sit however desired.

994
01:29:50,043 --> 01:29:51,739
The rest of them back?

995
01:29:58,582 --> 01:29:59,392
No.

996
01:30:01,537 --> 01:30:03,383
From what I know ...

997
01:30:04,146 --> 01:30:05,396
Is there anything else?

998
01:30:09,951 --> 01:30:10,976
That's all.

999
01:30:13,645 --> 01:30:15,916
If that's all,
you better run back to Sam.

1000
01:30:20,299 --> 01:30:21,828
I did it again.

1001
01:30:23,239 --> 01:30:25,552
I still break a promise.

1002
01:30:30,427 --> 01:30:32,419
We should not do this
each other.

1003
01:30:37,693 --> 01:30:39,365
Yes.

1004
01:31:15,073 --> 01:31:16,451
Swan family home.

1005
01:31:22,539 --> 01:31:23,787
Now is not here.

1006
01:31:25,367 --> 01:31:27,419
Organize a funeral.

1007
01:31:43,253 --> 01:31:44,221
Who?

1008
01:31:46,267 --> 01:31:48,137
I always put in the path.

1009
01:31:50,143 --> 01:31:51,395
Who?

1010
01:31:51,396 --> 01:31:53,819
- Bella, get back.
- Jake, who was?

1011
01:31:54,770 --> 01:31:57,719
Bella, is Edward.
I think you died.

1012
01:31:58,244 --> 01:31:59,909
Rose told her why I came here.

1013
01:32:02,773 --> 01:32:05,077
Why ...
Why did not you let you talk to him?

1014
01:32:05,747 --> 01:32:07,375
- I asked you!
- I do not care!

1015
01:32:07,376 --> 01:32:09,465
Bella! The cause Volturi.

1016
01:32:10,837 --> 01:32:12,454
And he wants to die.

1017
01:32:15,373 --> 01:32:17,665
He left, Bella.
You never wanted, Do you remember?

1018
01:32:17,666 --> 01:32:18,928
No.

1019
01:32:18,929 --> 01:32:21,069
I will not let you commit suicide
because vinovãþiei.

1020
01:32:22,224 --> 01:32:23,222
And your father?

1021
01:32:24,537 --> 01:32:27,351
I have eighteen years,
the law gives me the freedom to go.

1022
01:32:29,923 --> 01:32:31,315
Please.

1023
01:32:32,779 --> 01:32:35,813
Please. Stay here.

1024
01:32:36,678 --> 01:32:42,181
For Charlie ... For me.

1025
01:32:42,216 --> 01:32:46,441
I have to go.

1026
01:32:51,235 --> 01:32:53,063
I beg.

1027
01:32:54,932 --> 01:32:56,909
Please.

1028
01:32:58,587 --> 01:33:00,477
Farewell, Jacob.

1029
01:33:08,915 --> 01:33:09,902
Well.

1030
01:34:11,371 --> 01:34:13,136
You made a decision?

1031
01:34:13,899 --> 01:34:16,068
I fear that your gifts

1032
01:34:17,586 --> 01:34:19,574
are too valuable to be destroyed.

1033
01:34:19,609 --> 01:34:23,558
But if you are discontent among yours,

1034
01:34:23,593 --> 01:34:25,518
Join us.

1035
01:34:26,756 --> 01:34:30,594
We would be delighted to use your
talents.

1036
01:34:30,595 --> 01:34:33,556
You want to think about are even
whether to stay with us?

1037
01:34:35,799 --> 01:34:37,685
You know that I will anyway.

1038
01:34:38,146 --> 01:34:40,263
Not without reason.

1039
01:34:44,422 --> 01:34:46,243
What a waste.

1040
01:34:53,149 --> 01:34:54,708
I have not seen this car renting.

1041
01:34:54,743 --> 01:34:57,205
I hope you have something against
theft of cars.

1042
01:34:57,240 --> 01:34:58,095
Today no.

1043
01:35:01,899 --> 01:35:03,280
What? What do you see?

1044
01:35:03,315 --> 01:35:06,323
- It was refused.
- And I. ..

1045
01:35:06,324 --> 01:35:09,779
We exit the public
they will show people.

1046
01:35:09,780 --> 01:35:11,325
When?

1047
01:35:12,192 --> 01:35:14,422
We expect up to noon
when the sun is above the sky ...

1048
01:35:18,166 --> 01:35:20,146

- May have time.

1049
01:35:46,417 --> 01:35:47,257
Why are dressed in red?

1050
01:35:47,292 --> 01:35:48,608
Festival on St. Mark.

1051
01:35:48,609 --> 01:35:51,213
Commemorates the expulsion
Vampire the city.

1052
01:35:51,248 --> 01:35:52,785
It's an ideal context.

1053
01:35:53,111 --> 01:35:54,488
Volturi family will not leave
to reach far enough

1054
01:35:54,523 --> 01:35:55,630
order to show mulþumii.

1055
01:35:56,427 --> 01:35:57,717
We have at disposal
only five minutes ...

1056
01:35:57,718 --> 01:35:59,495
Bella? Breathe.

1057
01:36:06,547 --> 01:36:08,984
Bella, only to you
insight you will not coming.

1058
01:36:08,985 --> 01:36:11,871
If I go read my thoughts
believe that they lie and will hurry.

1059
01:36:13,264 --> 01:36:15,423
- Where to go?
- Will be under the Clock Tower.

1060
01:38:12,270 --> 01:38:14,216
- Paradise ...
- You have to move you!

1061
01:38:16,022 --> 01:38:18,230
Open your eyes! Look me!
I'm alive!

1062
01:38:19,510 --> 01:38:20,765
We have to move you!

1063
01:38:30,874 --> 01:38:32,018
You're here ...

1064
01:38:32,019 --> 01:38:33,376
I'm here.

1065
01:38:35,848 --> 01:38:37,208
You're alive!

1066
01:38:40,418 --> 01:38:41,860
Yes.

1067
01:38:51,078 --> 01:38:53,227
Do I see a time ...

1068
01:38:54,906 --> 01:38:57,871
like to know that I'm alive and that
Nothing to feel guilty.

1069
01:39:02,074 --> 01:39:05,171
Now ... I can let you go.

1070
01:39:08,581 --> 01:39:12,201
There will never be
you and me to go.

1071
01:39:13,922 --> 01:39:17,513
I ... I could not live in a world
that you do not have existed.

1072
01:39:18,810 --> 01:39:19,711
But you said ...

1073
01:39:20,146 --> 01:39:21,414
I lied.

1074
01:39:21,449 --> 01:39:24,330
I had to lie to you.
And thou hast believed so easily ...

1075
01:39:30,408 --> 01:39:33,623
Because it has no ninth
I love you to your ...

1076
01:39:36,625 --> 01:39:40,638
I ... only one man ...

1077
01:39:43,662 --> 01:39:45,272
You're everything to me.

1078
01:39:47,126 --> 01:39:48,500
Everything.

1079
01:40:14,419 --> 01:40:16,475
Eventually, we will need
your service, gentlemen.

1080
01:40:16,510 --> 01:40:18,099
Aro wants to talk again
with you.

1081
01:40:18,715 --> 01:40:19,964
No rule
was not violated.

1082
01:40:19,999 --> 01:40:23,703
However you should wear this
conversation in a more appropriate place.

1083
01:40:24,337 --> 01:40:29,159
Well. Bella, why do not you go
to enjoy the festival?

1084
01:40:29,194 --> 01:40:30,693
The girl came with us.

1085
01:40:30,728 --> 01:40:32,201
No way.
Fuck you.

1086
01:40:35,027 --> 01:40:37,487
Let, boys, is a festival.

1087
01:40:37,522 --> 01:40:39,385
I wanted not to make any scene.

1088
01:40:40,677 --> 01:40:42,303
There will be no scene.

1089
01:40:42,554 --> 01:40:43,677
Enough.

1090
01:40:45,497 --> 01:40:46,285
Jane.

1091
01:40:47,601 --> 01:40:49,543
Aro sent me to see
why it takes so.

1092
01:40:58,713 --> 01:41:00,151
Just do so tells you how.

1093
01:41:13,333 --> 01:41:14,563
Go.

1094
01:41:18,129 --> 01:41:20,491
Are you afraid?

1095
01:41:20,492 --> 01:41:21,820
You?

1096
01:41:56,703 --> 01:41:58,376
<i> Buon Poemeriggio.
( "Hello") </ i></i>

1097
01:42:03,100 --> 01:42:05,214
- It's man?
- Yes.

1098
01:42:08,266 --> 01:42:10,941
- And you?
- Yes.

1099
01:42:12,107 --> 01:42:14,017
So why ...

1100
01:42:15,251 --> 01:42:17,517
He wants to become ...

1101
01:42:17,518 --> 01:42:18,967
And I will become.

1102
01:42:18,968 --> 01:42:20,335
... A desert.

1103
01:42:29,363 --> 01:42:32,967
I have sent you bring one
and I will bring you.

1104
01:42:32,968 --> 01:42:35,211
And "and unca.

1105
01:42:35,212 --> 01:42:37,112
What girl isteaþã.

1106
01:42:37,113 --> 01:42:39,723
What a nice surprise!

1107
01:42:39,758 --> 01:42:43,273
Bella appears to be, however,
in life.

1108
01:42:44,100 --> 01:42:46,969
It's great?

1109
01:42:46,970 --> 01:42:49,833
I love a happy ending.

1110
01:42:54,613 --> 01:42:56,487
There are so rare ...

1111
01:43:00,208 --> 01:43:02,525
<i>La tua cantante  ...
(Your singer) </ i></i>

1112
01:43:02,997 --> 01:43:07,821
Her blood draws you so much
that excite me and I thirst.

1113
01:43:08,754 --> 01:43:11,181
How can you bear to know
so close to her?

1114
01:43:11,769 --> 01:43:13,449
Not without effort.

1115
01:43:13,484 --> 01:43:15,068
I see it.

1116
01:43:18,073 --> 01:43:21,401
With a single touch, see Aro
all I ever thought.

1117
01:43:22,949 --> 01:43:24,783
And now you know everything.

1118
01:43:24,784 --> 01:43:26,983
So Do it once.

1119
01:43:30,713 --> 01:43:33,837
And you cite are the soul of others,
Edward.

1120
01:43:35,325 --> 01:43:39,563
Although I. .. Bella can not read thoughts.

1121
01:43:42,877 --> 01:43:44,241
Excellent.

1122
01:43:48,139 --> 01:43:53,209
I would like to see if you are
and an exception for my gifts.

1123
01:43:55,905 --> 01:43:57,929
I do honor?

1124
01:44:19,161 --> 01:44:20,481
Interesting.

1125
01:44:22,603 --> 01:44:24,297
I see nothing.

1126
01:44:33,621 --> 01:44:36,130
I wonder if ...

1127
01:44:36,165 --> 01:44:41,189
Let's see if it immune to all
our powers. What about Jane?

1128
01:44:44,963 --> 01:44:45,944
Pain.

1129
01:45:04,343 --> 01:45:05,337
Please, stop!

1130
01:45:06,513 --> 01:45:09,223
Stop!
May not be sorry, please!

1131
01:45:11,117 --> 01:45:14,013
Jane?

1132
01:45:14,408 --> 01:45:15,160
Master?

1133
01:45:19,942 --> 01:45:21,441
Do it, honey.

1134
01:45:27,558 --> 01:45:29,418
It could hurt you less.

1135
01:45:45,664 --> 01:45:47,159
Outstanding!

1136
01:45:49,363 --> 01:45:52,252
We put all the difficulty.

1137
01:45:52,287 --> 01:45:55,670
What we do now with you?

1138
01:45:55,705 --> 01:45:59,189
You know already what you do, Aro.

1139
01:46:00,696 --> 01:46:02,525
He knows too much.

1140
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:04,669
Pose a risk.

1141
01:46:08,593 --> 01:46:09,803
It's true.

1142
01:46:14,015 --> 01:46:14,964
Felix ...

1143
01:47:22,007 --> 01:47:24,734
Please, no!
No, no, please!

1144
01:47:27,666 --> 01:47:30,606
Kill me!
Kill me, not him!

1145
01:47:42,955 --> 01:47:44,651
Extraordinary.

1146
01:47:46,095 --> 01:47:50,701
You sacrifice your life ...
for one of us?

1147
01:47:50,702 --> 01:47:52,799
A vampire?

1148
01:47:54,443 --> 01:47:57,953
- A soulless monster?
- Kill me once.

1149
01:48:02,878 --> 01:48:07,599
You do not know anything
about him.

1150
01:48:09,319 --> 01:48:16,005
<i> Maybe your soul ...
For each other. </ I></i>

1151
01:48:19,008 --> 01:48:21,691
How much tristeþe.

1152
01:48:22,937 --> 01:48:26,711
You have even the intention
to give him immortality ...

1153
01:48:35,419 --> 01:48:36,459
Please!

1154
01:48:38,372 --> 01:48:40,017
Bella will become one of us.

1155
01:48:40,018 --> 01:48:42,842
I saw.

1156
01:48:45,347 --> 01:48:47,273
I will turn Bella.

1157
01:49:20,989 --> 01:49:24,620
Excellent! To see things
glimpse of you,

1158
01:49:25,722 --> 01:49:28,407
before being spent!

1159
01:49:30,619 --> 01:49:37,416
Your gift will make you
interesting immortal creature,

1160
01:49:37,417 --> 01:49:40,348
<i>Isabella  ...</ i></i>

1161
01:49:44,824 --> 01:49:48,784
Go and you prepared.

1162
01:49:49,833 --> 01:49:52,409
Let's over with.

1163
01:49:53,641 --> 01:49:56,235
Heidi could come at any moment.

1164
01:49:58,023 --> 01:49:59,151
Thank you ...

1165
01:49:59,152 --> 01:50:01,235
to visit.

1166
01:50:01,236 --> 01:50:02,765
We will return favor.

1167
01:50:02,766 --> 01:50:05,969
Did he and advise
you hold the word.

1168
01:50:06,146 --> 01:50:08,194
We do not offer and a second chance.

1169
01:50:09,456 --> 01:50:12,985
Goodbye, my young friends.

1170
01:50:19,698 --> 01:50:20,900
Beautiful Booty, Heidi.

1171
01:50:20,901 --> 01:50:23,178
Yes, seems quite ... suculenþi.

1172
01:50:23,213 --> 01:50:24,404
Keep something and for me.

1173
01:50:26,366 --> 01:50:27,852
This way, please.

1174
01:50:27,887 --> 01:50:29,178
Stay together ...

1175
01:50:44,213 --> 01:50:45,686
Stop yourself!

1176
01:50:56,123 --> 01:50:57,565
You're here.

1177
01:50:59,559 --> 01:51:01,125
Go to sleep again.

1178
01:51:05,001 --> 01:51:07,681
I'll be here when you wake up.

1179
01:51:12,934 --> 01:51:18,080
I left only
believing that protect you.

1180
01:51:20,934 --> 01:51:26,963
I wanted to have a chance
to a normal and happy life.

1181
01:51:30,775 --> 01:51:33,415
But you were so easy to leave.

1182
01:51:35,672 --> 01:51:39,748
In my age of life
I was not ever more difficult.

1183
01:51:46,324 --> 01:51:47,786
Do you swear.

1184
01:51:47,787 --> 01:51:52,004
I will never wrong you i.

1185
01:51:54,062 --> 01:51:56,158
I'm so sorry ...

1186
01:51:58,090 --> 01:51:59,400
Here comes Charlie.

1187
01:52:02,867 --> 01:52:03,983
I feel better?

1188
01:52:05,664 --> 01:52:07,200
Yes.

1189
01:52:10,141 --> 01:52:12,158
Father,
Should not your worry.

1190
01:52:12,942 --> 01:52:14,956
Last time you said that
have disappeared.

1191
01:52:14,991 --> 01:52:16,555
There I saw three days.

1192
01:52:18,974 --> 01:52:20,819
I'm very sorry, Father.

1193
01:52:24,462 --> 01:52:26,800
Bella ...
You don 't ever do that.

1194
01:52:28,872 --> 01:52:30,022
Never.

1195
01:52:32,832 --> 01:52:36,822
And are punished
for the rest of life.

1196
01:52:38,106 --> 01:52:39,132
Well.

1197
01:52:49,304 --> 01:52:51,910
In theory, now does not violate any rule.

1198
01:52:55,168 --> 01:52:57,895
He said that I do not have permission
to put my foot in this house.

1199
01:52:59,348 --> 01:53:00,622
So I went through the window.

1200
01:53:05,162 --> 01:53:07,154
I will not forget easily.

1201
01:53:09,851 --> 01:53:11,045
I know.

1202
01:53:11,080 --> 01:53:14,902
But you can do?

1203
01:53:18,574 --> 01:53:20,681
I hope that you can do.

1204
01:53:20,716 --> 01:53:24,221
Because, frankly, I have no idea
how I could live without you.

1205
01:53:28,342 --> 01:53:30,297
Come.

1206
01:53:49,585 --> 01:53:54,756
You can not escape me
I will make you Alice.

1207
01:53:56,639 --> 01:53:58,700
You will not need to do.

1208
01:53:59,680 --> 01:54:02,092
There are ways of hiding the truth
Volturilor.

1209
01:54:04,941 --> 01:54:07,989
No. Not ...

1210
01:54:13,973 --> 01:54:16,029
You know with what we all want.

1211
01:54:18,357 --> 01:54:21,681
And I know how much sky.

1212
01:54:23,471 --> 01:54:26,387
I think the only way to correct
is to votaþi ...

1213
01:54:27,093 --> 01:54:28,617
You do not know what you're saying ...

1214
01:54:28,618 --> 01:54:30,115
Shut up.

1215
01:54:32,229 --> 01:54:33,255
Alice ...

1216
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:35,934
I think I have my sister.

1217
01:54:40,079 --> 01:54:41,465
- Yes!
- Thank you.

1218
01:54:41,598 --> 01:54:42,595
I vote that "yes".

1219
01:54:44,529 --> 01:54:47,446
We wish to be a door I do not want
all the time to kill.

1220
01:54:51,240 --> 01:54:52,798
I'm sorry.

1221
01:54:54,437 --> 01:54:57,747
We apologize both
for the way I fought.

1222
01:54:57,782 --> 01:55:01,405
And be grateful that you had the courage
to save my brother.

1223
01:55:04,039 --> 01:55:07,133
But that's life that
I had chosen one.

1224
01:55:09,841 --> 01:55:12,537
I would like to be a way
to vote "no" to me ...

1225
01:55:16,293 --> 01:55:17,873
So ... no.

1226
01:55:19,191 --> 01:55:20,622
I vote: "Hell, yes!

1227
01:55:23,183 --> 01:55:25,301
We can struggle with family Volturi
otherwise.

1228
01:55:25,621 --> 01:55:29,679
I think you already part
family. Yes.

1229
01:55:36,267 --> 01:55:38,134
Why I do this?

1230
01:55:40,223 --> 01:55:41,665
You know well what it means.

1231
01:55:41,700 --> 01:55:45,005
You are chosen to not live without it,
which does not give me choice.

1232
01:55:45,934 --> 01:55:47,765
No, I will lose my son.

1233
01:55:54,414 --> 01:55:58,312
I'll be waiting until after graduation,
I like to be Charlie's easier.

1234
01:56:03,191 --> 01:56:06,391
I would like you to be the
which I will turn.

1235
01:56:13,325 --> 01:56:15,215
He wants to talk.

1236
01:56:18,269 --> 01:56:19,999
I see you're alive ...
time.

1237
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,045
I think I get þin
far from it.

1238
01:56:22,661 --> 01:56:24,481
Stay away from my thoughts!

1239
01:56:26,086 --> 01:56:29,600
Jacob, I know you have something to tell me,

1240
01:56:31,949 --> 01:56:34,029
but first I wish
Let me tell you something. Okay?

1241
01:56:36,919 --> 01:56:38,145
Thank you.

1242
01:56:41,554 --> 01:56:45,356
Because you held a Bella
in life when I ... I did.

1243
01:56:46,767 --> 01:56:48,450
So it is. You did.

1244
01:56:49,437 --> 01:56:51,601
And I did it for you,
Trust me.

1245
01:56:52,258 --> 01:56:54,299
Do you are just as grateful.

1246
01:56:54,334 --> 01:56:55,795
But now I am back.

1247
01:56:55,830 --> 01:56:58,604
And I will not leave Bella
But only if she and I will ask.

1248
01:56:58,808 --> 01:56:59,874
We'll see.

1249
01:57:04,496 --> 01:57:06,202
It's my turn to speak.

1250
01:57:09,806 --> 01:57:11,980
I came to remind
of a critical point of the Treaty.

1251
01:57:13,365 --> 01:57:14,843
I forgot.

1252
01:57:15,470 --> 01:57:16,684
What essential item?

1253
01:57:16,685 --> 01:57:19,552
If any of them
muscle that a man

1254
01:57:19,553 --> 01:57:21,797
armistiþiul ending.

1255
01:57:23,499 --> 01:57:25,228
But if you want me,
has no link with you.

1256
01:57:25,263 --> 01:57:27,555
No. I will not leave!

1257
01:57:28,865 --> 01:57:30,979
You will become one by them, Bella!

1258
01:57:31,014 --> 01:57:33,017
It depends on you.

1259
01:57:34,043 --> 01:57:36,476
You know what you will do!
I will have a choice!

1260
01:57:36,716 --> 01:57:38,848
- Bella, please. Come.
- Wait.

1261
01:57:41,470 --> 01:57:43,402
I will be sorry?
Read her thoughts.

1262
01:57:51,622 --> 01:57:52,912
Jake ...

1263
01:57:59,358 --> 01:58:01,324
I love you.

1264
01:58:05,391 --> 01:58:07,425
So ... please,

1265
01:58:11,706 --> 01:58:13,703
not make me choose.

1266
01:58:19,413 --> 01:58:21,377
Because I will choose him.

1267
01:58:24,905 --> 01:58:27,214
I always chose him.

1268
01:58:43,516 --> 01:58:45,900
- Farewell, Jacob!
- You are talking to her!?

1269
01:58:51,259 --> 01:58:52,891
Go away.

1270
01:58:54,606 --> 01:58:55,984
Stops you!

1271
01:58:58,558 --> 01:58:59,900
Încetaþi!

1272
01:58:59,901 --> 01:59:02,144
You can not hurt each other
without saying sorry make one thousand.

1273
01:59:21,726 --> 01:59:23,258
Jake ...

1274
01:59:38,323 --> 01:59:39,587
He's right.

1275
01:59:39,588 --> 01:59:42,965
It should arrive
just like me.

1276
01:59:47,953 --> 01:59:49,645
No one can do alone.

1277
01:59:52,604 --> 01:59:54,682
So please, wait.

1278
02:00:01,596 --> 02:00:04,707
Let me ... five years.

1279
02:00:09,888 --> 02:00:11,693
It's too long.

1280
02:00:15,997 --> 02:00:17,420
Then three.

1281
02:00:22,069 --> 02:00:24,127
You're so încãpãþânatã.

1282
02:00:25,747 --> 02:00:27,225
What to expect?

1283
02:00:36,670 --> 02:00:39,998
I have one condition ...

1284
02:00:42,111 --> 02:00:44,622
if you want to do it myself.

1285
02:00:48,633 --> 02:00:50,474
What is the condition?

1286
02:00:50,475 --> 02:00:53,744
And then ... eternity.

1287
02:00:53,745 --> 02:00:56,169
Do you require this.

1288
02:01:07,669 --> 02:01:10,374
Marry me, Bella!

1289
02:01:17,283 --> 02:01:26,287
With love, from Felixuca
