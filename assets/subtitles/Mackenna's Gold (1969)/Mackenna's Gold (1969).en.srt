1
00:01:55,534 --> 00:01:58,203
There's an old story.
The way the Apaches tell it...

2
00:01:58,287 --> 00:02:01,457
...a man was riding in the desert
and came across a vulture...

3
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:06,295
...the kind they call turkey buzzards
in Arizona, sittin' on a rock.

4
00:02:07,546 --> 00:02:11,800
"Hey," the man says, "how come you
old turkey buzzard's sittin' here/

5
00:02:12,176 --> 00:02:15,888
"I saw you flying over Hadleyberg,
and I didn't want to meet up with you...

6
00:02:15,971 --> 00:02:19,933
"...so I turned around and come this way."
Old turkey buzzard says:

7
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:23,771
"That's funny,
I was only passing through that town.

8
00:02:24,271 --> 00:02:27,441
"I was really coming over here
to wait for you."

9
00:04:12,963 --> 00:04:16,467
A thousand years ago, in the Southwest,
there was an Apache legend.

10
00:04:18,135 --> 00:04:24,099
It told about a hidden canyon, guarded
by the Apache gods and rich with gold.

11
00:04:26,977 --> 00:04:31,315
As long as the Apaches kept the canyon
a secret and never touched the gold...

12
00:04:31,398 --> 00:04:34,693
...they would be strong, powerful.

13
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,363
That was the legend.

14
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,952
When the Spanish Conquistadores came,
they searched for that canyon.

15
00:04:44,036 --> 00:04:48,540
They called it "Canyon del Oro,"
meaning Canyon of Gold.

16
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,877
But they never found it.

17
00:04:55,339 --> 00:04:58,467
Three hundred years later,
the Americans came.

18
00:04:59,093 --> 00:05:03,806
They heard about the legend, but they
called the canyon, "The Lost Adams."

19
00:05:05,974 --> 00:05:11,146
That was because a man named Adams
saw it once, or so he said.

20
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,984
But whether he did or not,
he never saw anythin' again...

21
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:20,197
...because the Apaches
burned out his eyes.

22
00:05:21,865 --> 00:05:26,036
Everybody knew about that legend
and a lot of people believed it.

23
00:05:28,247 --> 00:05:33,168
Canyon del Oro. The Lost Adams.

24
00:05:35,212 --> 00:05:43,345
And then for a while there, back in 1874,
they called it, "Mackenna's Gold."

25
00:11:02,664 --> 00:11:06,794
Take it easy, old man.
You're not healthy enough to play games.

26
00:11:08,796 --> 00:11:12,007
I know you. You are Mackenna.

27
00:11:12,716 --> 00:11:16,011
- The marshal.
- That's right, but I don't know you.

28
00:11:16,845 --> 00:11:18,514
Why'd you try to bushwhack me?

29
00:11:21,517 --> 00:11:23,227
Somebody pay you?

30
00:11:23,852 --> 00:11:26,772
- Colorado?
- No pay. Nobody pay.

31
00:11:27,314 --> 00:11:30,859
- Well, then, why?
- Because you look for gold.

32
00:11:34,071 --> 00:11:38,033
You ought to be ashamed of yourself,
an old man like you...

33
00:11:38,242 --> 00:11:40,953
...going around shooting at prospectors.

34
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:44,081
Keep that up, you're gonna get in trouble.

35
00:11:44,164 --> 00:11:48,627
Besides, if you know me, you know
I quit gold huntin' a long time ago.

36
00:11:49,044 --> 00:11:53,924
The only dust I ever found was prairie dust.
Never got rich but I sure got thirsty.

37
00:11:54,049 --> 00:11:56,677
But now you look for the gold again.

38
00:11:57,052 --> 00:12:00,472
- Everybody look for the gold.
- What gold?

39
00:12:06,353 --> 00:12:07,646
What gold?

40
00:12:21,952 --> 00:12:25,205
I know this place. That's Shaking Rock.

41
00:12:26,373 --> 00:12:27,666
No gold around there.

42
00:12:29,585 --> 00:12:31,253
I've been there.

43
00:12:43,474 --> 00:12:47,519
Why you stay with me?
Why you not kill me?

44
00:12:47,603 --> 00:12:49,938
Well, that's what I oughta do.

45
00:12:52,566 --> 00:12:55,486
Tell you what, you give me your word
you won't go around...

46
00:12:55,569 --> 00:12:58,322
...pickin' off people anymore,
and I'll take you home.

47
00:12:58,405 --> 00:12:59,698
No home.

48
00:13:00,574 --> 00:13:02,701
Well, I'll get you to a doctor, anyway.

49
00:13:03,702 --> 00:13:05,579
I die here.

50
00:13:15,464 --> 00:13:18,008
Now you have the gold.

51
00:13:19,426 --> 00:13:23,055
But you will wish you never see this map.

52
00:13:23,764 --> 00:13:27,142
The spirits will kill you. No laugh.

53
00:13:28,018 --> 00:13:30,771
It is a secret place.

54
00:13:31,105 --> 00:13:36,318
So that's what it's supposed to be.
Canyon del Oro, The Lost Adams.

55
00:13:37,611 --> 00:13:40,072
Don't worry, old man,
I won't go looking for it.

56
00:13:40,155 --> 00:13:44,785
Wasted three good years chasing that
wild goose. There is no Lost Adams.

57
00:13:45,452 --> 00:13:47,037
It is bad time.

58
00:13:47,746 --> 00:13:50,374
Young warriors want gold...

59
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:52,584
...like white men.

60
00:13:53,252 --> 00:13:56,630
It is good time for old man to die.

61
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:02,094
Plenty of time for that, old man.
Don't rush it.

62
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:12,688
Feel like eating something?

63
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,323
Old man?

64
00:14:26,952 --> 00:14:28,245
Old man.

65
00:14:38,672 --> 00:14:43,010
I wish you hadn't shot at me.
I thought maybe you were someone else.

66
00:16:12,182 --> 00:16:14,184
Soldiers. Many soldiers.

67
00:16:17,646 --> 00:16:20,274
Sir, you have been most kind
and we are grateful.

68
00:16:20,357 --> 00:16:24,278
We ask no more of your hospitality
than the loan of a few horses and mules...

69
00:16:24,361 --> 00:16:27,948
...which we need,
and some food for our journey.

70
00:16:29,491 --> 00:16:31,368
Also, we will take your wife...

71
00:16:32,035 --> 00:16:35,914
...because if we run into trouble
with the Cavalry she may come in useful.

72
00:16:35,998 --> 00:16:40,335
If we pass this way again, God willing,
I will sell her back to you.

73
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:42,921
That is a true promise.

74
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,907
Take a rest, Marshal.

75
00:17:24,588 --> 00:17:27,174
We will finish the old man's grave.

76
00:17:49,488 --> 00:17:52,616
We'll make it a little longer, a little wider...

77
00:17:53,867 --> 00:17:56,203
...and then maybe we will
bury you together.

78
00:17:59,706 --> 00:18:01,458
God is good to me.

79
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:06,338
You remember?
I told you I would come for you, old friend.

80
00:18:08,132 --> 00:18:10,551
You'll never get back, old friend.

81
00:18:12,177 --> 00:18:13,929
I will find a way.

82
00:18:15,347 --> 00:18:18,767
Put that shovel down
and come and talk to Colorado.

83
00:18:39,872 --> 00:18:42,374
Don't move, Mackenna,
or I'll cut you in half.

84
00:18:44,918 --> 00:18:47,796
Now come out like a gentlemen.

85
00:19:05,981 --> 00:19:09,526
You know, we've been trailing
that old man for two weeks now.

86
00:19:09,902 --> 00:19:12,321
- Where's the map?
- Map? What map?

87
00:19:49,525 --> 00:19:52,152
I know this fellow.
He's a good card player.

88
00:19:52,277 --> 00:19:54,446
He always remembers the cards.

89
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:56,865
If he saw the map, he remembers it.

90
00:19:57,241 --> 00:20:00,035
So we have a map in his head.

91
00:20:01,703 --> 00:20:03,038
I told you.

92
00:20:03,372 --> 00:20:05,707
I told you nobody runs me out.

93
00:20:06,542 --> 00:20:09,628
And now I have you,
and you will take us to the gold.

94
00:20:12,256 --> 00:20:14,341
And then I will kill you.

95
00:20:34,778 --> 00:20:38,031
Hurry up, Besh.
Cover him with some rocks and let's go.

96
00:20:41,326 --> 00:20:45,080
No. He is a chief.
He was going to Canyon del Oro.

97
00:20:45,622 --> 00:20:47,124
We bury him there.

98
00:20:51,003 --> 00:20:52,337
Are you crazy?

99
00:20:52,796 --> 00:20:56,800
You know how bad he's going to stink
by the time we get there?

100
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:30,250
Of course. He's a chief.
He must be buried there.

101
00:21:30,918 --> 00:21:33,504
I should have thought of it myself.

102
00:22:34,106 --> 00:22:35,691
Besh, come on.

103
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:20,212
In the old days, before Mackenna ran him
out of the territory...

104
00:24:20,337 --> 00:24:23,340
...Colorado had a hideout
in a little box canyon.

105
00:24:24,591 --> 00:24:27,553
Now that he was back,
he was using it again.

106
00:24:27,886 --> 00:24:31,223
And that's where he took Mackenna,
his living map.

107
00:25:18,729 --> 00:25:20,355
You're crazy to come back.

108
00:25:20,439 --> 00:25:23,776
You know Judge Bergerman
put a price on your head.

109
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:28,739
You know, that's funny. I never lay eyes
on that Judge Bergerman.

110
00:25:28,906 --> 00:25:32,868
But he don't like me.
Well, someday me and him will meet.

111
00:25:33,577 --> 00:25:36,330
And I will take his head, in a basket.

112
00:25:37,331 --> 00:25:40,959
Anyway, I came back
after that map you burned up.

113
00:25:41,752 --> 00:25:45,839
Why? You can buy a dozen
just like it for a dollar a piece.

114
00:25:49,593 --> 00:25:54,223
Not like that map. Not like the map
old Prairie Dog was carrying.

115
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,769
Well, that old man wasn't Prairie Dog.
Prairie Dog is dead.

116
00:25:59,019 --> 00:26:00,437
He sure is now.

117
00:26:02,022 --> 00:26:04,441
The whole thing is a fairy tale.

118
00:26:05,275 --> 00:26:07,694
There's no Canyon del Oro.

119
00:26:07,945 --> 00:26:09,488
Old Adams was never there.

120
00:26:09,571 --> 00:26:12,199
Then why did you kill
Prairie Dog and take his map?

121
00:26:12,282 --> 00:26:15,744
- That's not the way it happened.
- I know how it happened.

122
00:26:15,828 --> 00:26:18,539
You just got tired of working
for $20 a month...

123
00:26:18,622 --> 00:26:21,208
...so you took advantage
of that poor old man.

124
00:26:21,291 --> 00:26:23,961
You bushwhacked him,
gunned him down, and took his map.

125
00:26:24,044 --> 00:26:26,547
I'm surprised at you. A marshal.

126
00:26:46,066 --> 00:26:49,027
- Hesh-ke remembers you.
- I remember her, too.

127
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,363
Hesh-ke.

128
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:58,287
What I can't figure out is how you knew
about this map. It's the only real one.

129
00:26:58,746 --> 00:27:01,707
It was supposed to be
only in Prairie Dog's head.

130
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:04,793
He was supposed to pass it on
before he died.

131
00:27:04,877 --> 00:27:08,046
Then somebody found out
there really was a map.

132
00:27:08,213 --> 00:27:11,383
And two weeks ago,
the old man up and left the tribe.

133
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,927
Well, why didn't he pass it on?

134
00:27:15,053 --> 00:27:18,182
I guess he didn't know who he could trust.

135
00:27:18,265 --> 00:27:20,559
See, the Apache have changed.

136
00:27:21,435 --> 00:27:23,896
They're beginning to think
like white men now.

137
00:27:23,979 --> 00:27:28,025
Some of the young think they got more use
for that gold than those old spirits.

138
00:27:28,108 --> 00:27:29,985
There isn't any gold.

139
00:27:30,277 --> 00:27:33,322
And if there was,
it would belong to the whole tribe.

140
00:27:35,324 --> 00:27:36,825
You're wrong.

141
00:27:37,534 --> 00:27:41,663
That gold belongs to the spirits,
and they said I can have it.

142
00:27:46,001 --> 00:27:48,378
Listen, old friend, I know you.

143
00:27:48,629 --> 00:27:51,548
You're just like an Apache: Very stubborn.

144
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,385
These other friends of mine here,
they are stubborn, too.

145
00:27:55,469 --> 00:27:59,223
Why don't you just take us there
and we'll be partners?

146
00:27:59,348 --> 00:28:01,809
- There's enough for all of us.
- I've been there.

147
00:28:01,892 --> 00:28:05,479
There's not enough gold there
to fill your back tooth.

148
00:28:07,356 --> 00:28:10,442
- You've been in the canyon?
- There's no canyon.

149
00:28:11,318 --> 00:28:14,571
You don't know.
Listen, you like to gamble.

150
00:28:15,239 --> 00:28:16,657
Let's take a chance.

151
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,409
Suppose we lose?

152
00:28:18,492 --> 00:28:22,121
Well, then we split up
and you go wherever you want.

153
00:28:22,579 --> 00:28:25,582
How? On foot with my hands tied
behind my back?

154
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:30,796
No. I'll give you anything you need.
Water, horses, your guns.

155
00:28:31,755 --> 00:28:33,841
- When?
- When what?

156
00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:35,217
The guns?

157
00:28:37,928 --> 00:28:41,432
When you take us there.
I mean, you gotta prove yourself, no?

158
00:28:46,478 --> 00:28:50,482
I'll tell you what else I'll give you.
I will give you the girl.

159
00:28:50,691 --> 00:28:53,819
- What girl?
- The one you've been looking at.

160
00:28:54,445 --> 00:28:57,281
I tell you the truth. Her husband's rich.

161
00:28:57,448 --> 00:29:00,284
- You will get a big reward.
- No!

162
00:29:02,578 --> 00:29:05,831
Monkey, what do we want?
We want the gold. Why?

163
00:29:06,498 --> 00:29:10,502
Because when we get the gold,
we can buy all the women we want.

164
00:29:10,794 --> 00:29:15,382
Besides, if Laguna don't show up
tomorrow, it's an extra share for all of us.

165
00:29:15,632 --> 00:29:16,717
No.

166
00:29:17,426 --> 00:29:21,013
You want the Scar-face? Take her.

167
00:29:22,306 --> 00:29:24,349
Take the little fat one.

168
00:29:24,892 --> 00:29:26,685
Take the old woman.

169
00:29:29,104 --> 00:29:31,398
You can have lots of fun.

170
00:29:36,069 --> 00:29:38,280
What do you say, we shake on it?

171
00:29:40,115 --> 00:29:41,366
All right.

172
00:29:43,118 --> 00:29:46,955
I'll take you there.
And the gold is all yours.

173
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,543
I'll take you there and then I go,
like you said.

174
00:29:52,544 --> 00:29:53,629
No gold?

175
00:29:54,963 --> 00:29:56,006
Why?

176
00:29:56,090 --> 00:30:00,552
You like Hadleyberg so much?
They don't like you. That's what I hear.

177
00:30:00,677 --> 00:30:04,681
I'll tell you the truth. I'm superstitious.

178
00:30:05,641 --> 00:30:08,310
I don't want to tangle
with those Indian spirits.

179
00:30:08,393 --> 00:30:11,271
- Okay. You're crazy, but okay.
- And another thing.

180
00:30:11,355 --> 00:30:15,067
You tell your little boy there
I want all my stuff back.

181
00:30:15,651 --> 00:30:19,071
Sure. I keep everything safe
for you until you go.

182
00:30:23,867 --> 00:30:26,829
But there's no gold and there's no canyon.

183
00:30:30,416 --> 00:30:32,584
I make the jokes, compadre.

184
00:30:36,255 --> 00:30:37,548
Hesh-ke.

185
00:31:18,422 --> 00:31:21,341
You're lucky.
Looks like she ain't holding no grudge.

186
00:31:21,425 --> 00:31:24,219
She was mad. I think she still likes you.

187
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:27,389
Too bad I already gave her to Monkey.

188
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:30,184
You want to change your mind?

189
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:13,477
Sleep well, old friend.

190
00:32:40,963 --> 00:32:42,005
Miss.

191
00:32:45,092 --> 00:32:50,139
You know me. I'm Mackenna, the marshal.

192
00:32:58,021 --> 00:33:00,149
I'm not going to hurt you.

193
00:33:02,109 --> 00:33:03,652
You know me.

194
00:33:04,862 --> 00:33:07,489
It was your father who made me marshal.

195
00:33:16,165 --> 00:33:18,333
They killed my father.

196
00:33:23,005 --> 00:33:24,965
They killed my father.

197
00:33:25,257 --> 00:33:29,678
Don't tell any of them, nobody,
that you're Judge Bergerman's daughter.

198
00:33:31,221 --> 00:33:35,809
If Colorado finds that out, you'll be
in worse trouble than you are now.

199
00:33:36,518 --> 00:33:38,103
You understand?

200
00:33:58,082 --> 00:33:59,541
You hear me?

201
00:34:13,514 --> 00:34:14,932
Yes, I remember you.

202
00:34:15,641 --> 00:34:18,185
You came out to the ranch once for supper.

203
00:34:18,268 --> 00:34:20,771
That's right. I was once.

204
00:34:22,022 --> 00:34:24,441
They say you like to play cards.

205
00:34:24,983 --> 00:34:31,448
Well, yes, I enjoy an unfriendly game
of poker from time to time.

206
00:34:32,116 --> 00:34:37,579
Off-duty, of course.
I take a drink now and then, too.

207
00:34:39,623 --> 00:34:42,584
My father didn't hold with gambling
and neither do I.

208
00:34:42,751 --> 00:34:45,421
Well, I know, Miss. I know that.

209
00:34:46,046 --> 00:34:49,800
I'm trying to mend my ways. Seriously.

210
00:34:50,801 --> 00:34:55,264
It doesn't look right for a marshal
to be playing cards. I know that.

211
00:34:55,472 --> 00:34:56,932
Now you rest.

212
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:01,228
Try to sleep.

213
00:35:01,895 --> 00:35:04,189
And remember what I told you.

214
00:36:22,351 --> 00:36:25,729
We start early tomorrow.
Go get some sleep.

215
00:36:37,116 --> 00:36:41,578
You see, I keep my end of the deal,
old friend. You keep yours.

216
00:36:43,705 --> 00:36:47,167
Better put your belt on.
You could lose your pants.

217
00:37:04,184 --> 00:37:07,438
- Okay, come on.
- Ain't we gonna wait for Laguna?

218
00:37:08,522 --> 00:37:13,235
Naw. He likes that girl in Hadleyberg
so much, let him get rich with her.

219
00:37:16,488 --> 00:37:18,365
Man comes with flag.

220
00:38:01,492 --> 00:38:03,660
Hesh-ke, take the girl inside.

221
00:38:12,669 --> 00:38:15,255
I don't think they're looking for you,
Marshal.

222
00:38:15,339 --> 00:38:18,634
But if they are, I would like to kill you.

223
00:38:21,804 --> 00:38:25,432
I don't know how I'd get you
to that canyon if you did.

224
00:38:27,059 --> 00:38:31,063
You could with a broken kneecap.
Painful, but possible.

225
00:38:31,897 --> 00:38:35,943
If you want to collect the reward on that
girl, remember that Hesh-ke has a knife.

226
00:38:38,195 --> 00:38:39,530
Colorado!

227
00:38:40,739 --> 00:38:41,865
John Colorado!

228
00:38:43,492 --> 00:38:44,743
Ben!

229
00:38:46,286 --> 00:38:48,038
Ben Baker! Ben!

230
00:38:48,414 --> 00:38:49,748
- My old friend!
- No!

231
00:38:49,832 --> 00:38:52,126
Stay where you are, Colorado.

232
00:38:54,211 --> 00:38:56,171
Who's that with you?

233
00:38:58,507 --> 00:39:01,969
Why, Marshal. You and Colorado together.

234
00:39:03,178 --> 00:39:04,721
Well, well, well.

235
00:39:04,805 --> 00:39:06,390
- Surprised?
- No.

236
00:39:06,557 --> 00:39:09,101
Some of the people with me might be,
but not me.

237
00:39:09,184 --> 00:39:10,853
Not with a stake like this one.

238
00:39:12,229 --> 00:39:15,357
No, this is no time for holding old grudges.

239
00:39:15,774 --> 00:39:20,028
Speaking for myself, I'm glad you're here.
We can play some poker.

240
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,156
Not with your cards.

241
00:39:24,825 --> 00:39:28,787
Welcome back, Colorado.
And there's enough for all of us.

242
00:39:29,997 --> 00:39:32,666
- Enough?
- We know all about it.

243
00:39:33,375 --> 00:39:36,378
We know you've been looking
for Prairie Dog.

244
00:39:36,587 --> 00:39:40,215
We know you got the word from Besh
and Little Hatchet here.

245
00:39:41,925 --> 00:39:46,889
How? And how'd you know we were here?
Nobody but us knows about this place.

246
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:54,271
Laguna.

247
00:39:55,856 --> 00:39:57,608
Sorry, Colorado.

248
00:39:58,776 --> 00:39:59,985
You know me.

249
00:40:00,611 --> 00:40:03,989
- I drink too much, then I talk too much.
- Yeah.

250
00:40:04,698 --> 00:40:05,824
Then they had me.

251
00:40:06,825 --> 00:40:10,621
You see, didn't I say
Laguna shouldn't go into Hadleyberg?

252
00:40:10,954 --> 00:40:14,083
Colorado, it's a big desert.

253
00:40:15,209 --> 00:40:18,462
It's going to take a lot of eyes
to find that old man.

254
00:40:18,629 --> 00:40:22,382
And after that,
it's going to be a long way to the canyon.

255
00:40:22,466 --> 00:40:26,136
There's cavalry out after you.
More than you've ever seen.

256
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:30,516
And a lot of bronco Apaches on the prowl,
after anybody and everybody.

257
00:40:30,766 --> 00:40:33,060
Probably after the gold, too.

258
00:40:34,061 --> 00:40:36,605
You don't know what's going on out there.

259
00:40:39,233 --> 00:40:40,526
You need us.

260
00:40:43,779 --> 00:40:45,364
One more thing.

261
00:40:45,697 --> 00:40:49,660
You got yourself a mighty fine place here,
but it's a box canyon.

262
00:40:50,411 --> 00:40:53,122
One way in, same way out.

263
00:40:54,581 --> 00:40:57,876
We could camp outside
until you get awful hungry.

264
00:41:00,546 --> 00:41:02,965
Well, there's a lot in what you say.

265
00:41:04,091 --> 00:41:08,220
Of course, if the soldiers catch us together,
you will hang together with me.

266
00:41:10,889 --> 00:41:13,350
If Mackenna's gonna
take a chance with you...

267
00:41:15,394 --> 00:41:17,354
...that's good enough for me.

268
00:41:17,688 --> 00:41:19,857
Well, what do you think, Mackenna?

269
00:41:23,944 --> 00:41:25,529
I'm glad he's here.

270
00:41:26,071 --> 00:41:29,742
Like he says,
we can play some poker along the way.

271
00:41:37,458 --> 00:41:42,004
Besh, with respect, move the chief.

272
00:41:46,091 --> 00:41:49,011
It is true that there's enough for all of us.

273
00:41:49,261 --> 00:41:53,140
But it is also true
that it's a long way to the canyon.

274
00:41:57,603 --> 00:42:00,522
It's a deal.
Come up and have some breakfast.

275
00:42:07,321 --> 00:42:08,280
Hold it!

276
00:42:09,907 --> 00:42:11,492
He double-crossed me.

277
00:42:12,117 --> 00:42:15,412
You all knew I'd kill him
the first chance I got.

278
00:42:16,914 --> 00:42:21,794
Anyway, there's enough for all of us,
only now there'll be a little bit more.

279
00:42:28,842 --> 00:42:30,010
Okay.

280
00:42:35,015 --> 00:42:38,602
Only no more killing,
or there sure will be a lot of it.

281
00:43:11,051 --> 00:43:15,722
You know, Ben, we've got a deal, but...

282
00:43:16,682 --> 00:43:20,477
...I wish I could have seen
all your friends before we made it.

283
00:43:21,145 --> 00:43:23,147
What's wrong with them?

284
00:43:24,857 --> 00:43:29,570
These two, I don't know what they are.
And I'm afraid to guess.

285
00:43:33,282 --> 00:43:36,785
We were just passing through Hadleyberg...

286
00:43:37,286 --> 00:43:40,914
...and I'm afraid we overheard
a most interesting conversation.

287
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:45,252
Mr. Baker was kind enough
to allow us to join the group.

288
00:43:45,335 --> 00:43:49,006
He promised this to be good sport.
And profitable, too.

289
00:43:50,966 --> 00:43:52,134
Is that so?

290
00:43:55,262 --> 00:43:56,680
Is that so?

291
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:58,098
Colorado.

292
00:43:59,141 --> 00:44:01,185
Yeah. "Good sport."

293
00:44:04,772 --> 00:44:09,151
I know this fellow.
You're the storekeeper from Hadleyberg.

294
00:44:10,903 --> 00:44:13,447
Does your wife know where you are?

295
00:44:16,283 --> 00:44:19,411
I don't know this one,
but he looks pale, too.

296
00:44:20,245 --> 00:44:22,498
What are you? A dentist?

297
00:44:22,956 --> 00:44:26,293
No. He's the editor
of the Hadleyberg Gazette.

298
00:44:29,797 --> 00:44:32,925
- This one looks like a preacher.
- I preach.

299
00:44:33,425 --> 00:44:36,553
- Yeah? What you preach, gold?
- The Word of God.

300
00:44:37,012 --> 00:44:38,764
Yeah, but you like gold, right?

301
00:44:39,306 --> 00:44:42,392
It can work for the Lord
as well as the devil.

302
00:44:42,476 --> 00:44:45,562
Why should only
the Church of Rome have gold?

303
00:44:46,313 --> 00:44:49,817
Gold, silver, idols and corruption.

304
00:44:50,359 --> 00:44:51,735
When I get my gold...

305
00:44:51,819 --> 00:44:53,695
- Your gold?
...my share.

306
00:44:55,364 --> 00:44:58,367
My share will build
a tabernacle to the Lord.

307
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:03,747
A temple of the true Gospel,
a whole string of 'em through the territory.

308
00:45:04,915 --> 00:45:08,210
Ben, to bring this fella,
you gotta be crazier than he is.

309
00:45:08,293 --> 00:45:11,630
I told you, everybody knows.
You can't keep gold a secret.

310
00:45:11,713 --> 00:45:13,549
It travels in the air.

311
00:45:14,216 --> 00:45:18,470
Anyway, we can use every gun we can get,
no matter who carries it.

312
00:45:19,096 --> 00:45:20,639
Mackenna.

313
00:45:20,764 --> 00:45:24,393
Preacher, this isn't going to be
like a walk to church on Sunday.

314
00:45:24,476 --> 00:45:28,522
You might get yourself killed.
Might have to do some killing yourself.

315
00:45:28,605 --> 00:45:31,859
The Lord knows
what he wants his servants to do.

316
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:37,322
Anyway, that gold belongs to the Apache.

317
00:45:37,573 --> 00:45:40,617
It can be used for them,
to bring 'em to the Lord.

318
00:45:40,701 --> 00:45:44,496
Ay, Chihuahua!
He makes a good deal with his Lord.

319
00:45:47,374 --> 00:45:51,754
Now we come to the last and the best.
A blind man and a kid.

320
00:45:52,296 --> 00:45:54,715
I see good enough for both of us.

321
00:45:54,798 --> 00:45:58,093
That old man has a better right
to be here than we have.

322
00:45:58,177 --> 00:45:59,428
Don't you know him?

323
00:46:00,471 --> 00:46:02,139
That's Adams himself.

324
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:04,183
Adams?

325
00:46:07,561 --> 00:46:09,229
That's Adams.

326
00:46:14,193 --> 00:46:18,113
- You see? That's Adams.
- I see Adams.

327
00:46:18,697 --> 00:46:22,910
- I don't see any gold.
- There's gold there.

328
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:27,748
More gold than you ever saw.
All the gold in the world.

329
00:46:28,832 --> 00:46:31,126
Yeah, tell him. Tell him the story.

330
00:46:32,336 --> 00:46:34,546
No. It's been told too many times.

331
00:46:34,963 --> 00:46:38,592
But we're gonna take you back there.
Go on, Mr. Adams.

332
00:46:38,675 --> 00:46:40,385
- Tell us.
- No.

333
00:46:48,268 --> 00:46:51,271
Well, it was the Mexican
that took us there...

334
00:46:52,606 --> 00:46:55,442
...the one who was brought up
by the Apaches.

335
00:46:56,819 --> 00:46:59,279
He didn't want no gold for himself.

336
00:47:00,489 --> 00:47:01,907
He was afraid.

337
00:47:03,075 --> 00:47:06,662
Kept talking about the old Apache spirits.

338
00:47:07,454 --> 00:47:10,040
All he wanted was a string of horses.

339
00:47:11,417 --> 00:47:13,335
So we gave it to him.

340
00:47:15,754 --> 00:47:18,298
The way he took us there...

341
00:47:19,007 --> 00:47:22,219
...twisting and turning,
and mostly by night.

342
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:25,305
We never knew where we were.

343
00:47:26,098 --> 00:47:30,269
And at the last,
he made us put on blindfolds.

344
00:47:33,313 --> 00:47:35,023
When we took 'em off...

345
00:47:37,276 --> 00:47:38,485
...there it was...

346
00:47:40,487 --> 00:47:43,073
...the prettiest little valley you ever saw.

347
00:47:45,784 --> 00:47:50,122
Sparkling and shining in the sun.
It was just like a dream.

348
00:47:52,291 --> 00:47:56,462
Indians used to live there 1,000 years ago,
maybe even more.

349
00:47:57,296 --> 00:48:00,299
And gold everywhere!

350
00:48:01,633 --> 00:48:04,219
The canyon wall had streaks...

351
00:48:05,596 --> 00:48:07,973
...five yards, ten yards wide.

352
00:48:09,224 --> 00:48:14,146
On the canyon floor, there were nuggets
laying all over the ground. Pure gold.

353
00:48:17,316 --> 00:48:19,860
Gold dust in every clump of brush.

354
00:48:22,446 --> 00:48:26,617
You couldn't put a pan in the river
without showing colour.

355
00:48:28,827 --> 00:48:33,332
Well, the first day we filled
a great big coffee pot with just nuggets.

356
00:48:34,333 --> 00:48:36,210
No one could lift it.

357
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:38,712
Well, we built a shack.

358
00:48:39,963 --> 00:48:41,340
Went to work.

359
00:48:43,967 --> 00:48:47,971
Next thing, the Apaches were there.

360
00:48:50,265 --> 00:48:52,684
They killed everyone, except me.

361
00:48:54,311 --> 00:48:59,733
Then they fixed my eyes,
and left me in the desert.

362
00:49:02,528 --> 00:49:05,823
I wasn't any older than this lad here.

363
00:49:09,368 --> 00:49:11,495
Tell 'em about the nugget.

364
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:17,668
Well, when I got found...

365
00:49:18,377 --> 00:49:22,631
...I still had one little nugget
in my pocket. Just a little one.

366
00:49:24,258 --> 00:49:26,510
$190 it was worth.

367
00:49:28,262 --> 00:49:29,847
Just a little one.

368
00:50:12,347 --> 00:50:14,850
You know something? You're pretty.

369
00:50:16,685 --> 00:50:19,855
I don't know if you are a boy or a girl.

370
00:50:21,899 --> 00:50:25,778
If you are a boy,
I'm going to give you a haircut.

371
00:50:26,528 --> 00:50:29,823
If you are a girl, I am going to kiss you.

372
00:50:32,409 --> 00:50:34,411
I think you are a girl.

373
00:50:52,429 --> 00:50:54,014
That's Hachita.

374
00:51:02,189 --> 00:51:02,981
Soldiers!

375
00:51:35,055 --> 00:51:38,016
Now who's going to do it,
your men or mine?

376
00:51:38,392 --> 00:51:42,521
- Yours. You have more to spare.
- We'll cut for it.

377
00:51:45,149 --> 00:51:47,359
Okay. But I shuffle.

378
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,547
When we move out...

379
00:52:09,298 --> 00:52:11,633
...you gentlemen head
straight for the Cavalry.

380
00:52:11,717 --> 00:52:14,887
Tell them about Colorado.
You tell 'em I'm his prisoner.

381
00:52:15,053 --> 00:52:18,307
What? I don't understand.
How could you be his prisoner?

382
00:52:18,557 --> 00:52:22,895
- You trying to get rid of us?
- I'm trying to save your lives.

383
00:52:23,062 --> 00:52:25,564
Forget about the gold, Mr. Weaver,
there isn't any.

384
00:52:25,647 --> 00:52:28,734
- Get back to your store.
- I don't believe you. You're lying!

385
00:52:28,817 --> 00:52:31,945
You know better. Get out.
A man like you has no business here.

386
00:52:32,029 --> 00:52:34,907
There's good use for gold.
Do a lot for the territory.

387
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:37,701
- Forget about it. Do what I tell you.
- No.

388
00:52:43,415 --> 00:52:45,167
These men have gold fever.

389
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:47,211
Get out of this. Get to the Cavalry.

390
00:52:47,294 --> 00:52:48,837
Mackenna.

391
00:53:00,265 --> 00:53:04,103
- What is he telling you?
- The truth. I told them to go home.

392
00:53:06,688 --> 00:53:10,651
Why are you so selfish?
You can't keep it all for yourself.

393
00:53:11,402 --> 00:53:14,446
Did he tell you that he killed Prairie Dog?

394
00:53:14,738 --> 00:53:17,366
He burned the map,
but he knows where the canyon is.

395
00:53:17,449 --> 00:53:20,744
- That's the truth.
- Well, now, that's more like it.

396
00:53:21,537 --> 00:53:23,872
I never trusted you, Mackenna.

397
00:53:24,665 --> 00:53:28,502
I knew it was a mistake to let the judge
talk us into making you a marshal.

398
00:53:28,585 --> 00:53:32,339
A man from nowhere. A drifter.
You never were one of us.

399
00:53:32,673 --> 00:53:35,843
- I cleaned up your town.
- Where's your badge now?

400
00:53:36,009 --> 00:53:38,804
Marshal, did you really kill that old man?

401
00:53:39,096 --> 00:53:42,057
Sure, but it was self-defence.

402
00:53:43,058 --> 00:53:44,560
You're a murderer!

403
00:53:47,187 --> 00:53:49,398
It's been a nice, quick trial.

404
00:53:50,274 --> 00:53:51,900
When's the hanging?

405
00:53:52,067 --> 00:53:56,572
What's all this talk of hanging?
We're all friends here. All partners.

406
00:54:00,993 --> 00:54:03,120
Inga! What are you doing here?

407
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:06,165
Why is she here?

408
00:54:08,709 --> 00:54:12,004
I will tell you.
I will tell you the whole truth.

409
00:54:12,838 --> 00:54:16,133
On our way to meet Mackenna,
when he sent for us...

410
00:54:16,842 --> 00:54:20,304
...we ran out of food,
so we stopped at a little ranch.

411
00:54:20,888 --> 00:54:24,349
We expected to pay, but the man...

412
00:54:25,642 --> 00:54:27,269
...he starts to shoot.

413
00:54:27,811 --> 00:54:32,524
So we beg, "Please, stop!"
He's crazy. He won't listen.

414
00:54:38,322 --> 00:54:43,243
So we thought the best thing to do,
make her a partner, give her a full share.

415
00:54:44,995 --> 00:54:46,163
Your father's dead?

416
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:51,043
But what can we do now? Nothing.

417
00:54:51,877 --> 00:54:54,588
We'll never get another chance like this.

418
00:54:54,671 --> 00:54:57,466
- You mean it was an accident?
- I swear it.

419
00:54:58,008 --> 00:55:00,177
I, myself, said a prayer over his grave.

420
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:04,556
Well, we can't bring him back now,
that's for sure. Right, Fuller?

421
00:55:09,186 --> 00:55:10,687
No, we can't.

422
00:55:11,355 --> 00:55:13,065
Right, storekeeper?

423
00:55:13,607 --> 00:55:16,402
I don't know. I don't know what to think.

424
00:55:17,653 --> 00:55:19,488
This isn't what I expected.

425
00:55:19,571 --> 00:55:23,575
I didn't think it would be like this.
I don't know what to do.

426
00:55:23,909 --> 00:55:27,830
You can get out of this, all of you,
before it's too late.

427
00:55:30,332 --> 00:55:35,212
Gentlemen, forgive me, I'm a stranger here
so I haven't followed a good deal of this...

428
00:55:35,295 --> 00:55:41,510
...but I do feel it would be a terrible pity
if we fell out among ourselves...

429
00:55:41,969 --> 00:55:45,431
...or if we abandoned
what we all set out to accomplish.

430
00:55:46,432 --> 00:55:49,393
I mean, we're embarked
on a great adventure, gentlemen.

431
00:55:49,476 --> 00:55:52,563
Something that comes
only once in a lifetime.

432
00:55:52,855 --> 00:55:57,568
So, I propose that we forget the past,
whatever may have occurred...

433
00:55:57,693 --> 00:55:59,486
...and all go forward.

434
00:56:00,279 --> 00:56:02,865
He's right!

435
00:56:03,574 --> 00:56:07,578
Why else do you think the good God
brings us all together like this?

436
00:56:07,661 --> 00:56:09,538
It's true, Padrecito?

437
00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:12,124
I have nothing to say to you.

438
00:56:13,375 --> 00:56:18,464
The Lord has his own ways
and I have my own reasons for being here.

439
00:56:19,715 --> 00:56:22,968
So we agree,
Mackenna takes us to the canyon.

440
00:56:23,135 --> 00:56:24,720
Sure, we agree.

441
00:56:25,512 --> 00:56:29,933
We all agree to get rich.
We're all going to be millionaires.

442
00:56:30,684 --> 00:56:32,269
Every one of you.

443
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:36,023
That's what you think,
and nothing else matters.

444
00:56:36,815 --> 00:56:39,068
The best man your town had
has been murdered.

445
00:56:39,151 --> 00:56:41,945
And all you can say is,
"Well, we can't bring him back."

446
00:56:42,029 --> 00:56:44,323
Not much of an epitaph, is it?

447
00:56:44,573 --> 00:56:46,533
It's all you've got time for.

448
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:51,580
You can't see, you can't hear, you don't
want to know anything but that gold.

449
00:56:51,914 --> 00:56:53,707
You're sick with it, all of you.

450
00:56:53,791 --> 00:56:57,669
I started out being his prisoner
and now I've got you all on my back.

451
00:56:57,878 --> 00:57:00,255
There's no gold, no canyon.
There's nothing.

452
00:57:00,339 --> 00:57:04,635
It's just a story that this old man tells
to get himself free drinks.

453
00:57:07,846 --> 00:57:10,390
I'll take you there. I got no choice.

454
00:57:12,059 --> 00:57:15,729
But I'll tell you this,
not many of you will be coming back.

455
00:57:17,815 --> 00:57:19,358
There is gold.

456
00:57:19,775 --> 00:57:22,486
I saw it. All the gold in the world.

457
00:57:35,082 --> 00:57:37,793
Come on. We're wasting time.

458
00:57:40,087 --> 00:57:43,424
You know, I'm beginning not to trust you.

459
00:57:44,508 --> 00:57:45,426
I trust you.

460
00:57:53,976 --> 00:57:59,398
My God, after all these years, don't you
know you mount a horse on the left side?

461
00:58:05,446 --> 00:58:08,866
They figured they had only one chance
of gettin' past the Cavalry...

462
00:58:08,949 --> 00:58:10,784
...and they had a plan.

463
00:58:12,369 --> 00:58:15,372
They'd gotten the squaw
so drunk she couldn't talk.

464
00:58:16,457 --> 00:58:20,711
And two of Baker's men
were gonna ride her right into the camp...

465
00:58:20,794 --> 00:58:23,881
...making out they were being chased
by Apaches.

466
00:58:24,757 --> 00:58:28,010
And while Hachita, Besh,
and Monkey were carryin' on...

467
00:58:28,093 --> 00:58:31,180
...as though they were
a whole raidin' party...

468
00:58:31,305 --> 00:58:34,516
...all the rest were gonna
take off a different way.

469
00:58:34,683 --> 00:58:37,603
If it all went well, they'd meet up later.

470
00:58:38,604 --> 00:58:40,355
That was the plan.

471
00:58:40,481 --> 00:58:44,068
And with a little bit of luck,
it just could work.

472
00:59:19,686 --> 00:59:21,355
What's going on?

473
00:59:21,647 --> 00:59:23,107
I can't tell, sir.

474
00:59:35,911 --> 00:59:37,287
Don't shoot!

475
00:59:49,007 --> 00:59:50,259
It's a squaw.

476
00:59:50,342 --> 00:59:51,969
Tied to the horse!

477
00:59:55,973 --> 00:59:57,516
Easy. Easy.

478
00:59:57,808 --> 00:59:59,560
Where's the sergeant?

479
01:00:50,194 --> 01:00:52,738
Get out of the way.

480
01:00:55,324 --> 01:00:57,159
All right, let go.

481
01:01:01,747 --> 01:01:03,999
What the hell's going on here, Sergeant?

482
01:01:04,083 --> 01:01:06,752
Pie-eyed, sir.
I'll get some black coffee into her.

483
01:01:06,835 --> 01:01:09,088
Maybe we'll make some sense out of this.

484
01:01:09,213 --> 01:01:12,424
All right, the party's over.
Get back to your posts, all of you.

485
01:01:12,508 --> 01:01:14,510
Do you hear me? Move!

486
01:01:45,207 --> 01:01:47,209
So now they were all together.

487
01:01:47,501 --> 01:01:49,878
The good citizens and the outlaws...

488
01:01:50,921 --> 01:01:52,840
...and Mackenna and the girl.

489
01:01:54,591 --> 01:01:57,886
They made for the waterhole
at the old Brogan ranch...

490
01:01:57,970 --> 01:02:02,307
...because it was the last chance
to fill up before they hit the desert.

491
01:02:04,226 --> 01:02:08,814
The Apaches had burnt out the old
Brogan place about five years before.

492
01:02:09,857 --> 01:02:13,318
Nobody ever took it over
because it was too far out.

493
01:02:15,237 --> 01:02:19,241
But everybody knew about
the waterhole, and everybody used it.

494
01:02:20,242 --> 01:02:24,329
It was kind of neutral territory.

495
01:02:37,092 --> 01:02:38,469
It's the Cavalry!

496
01:02:38,594 --> 01:02:40,804
We're surrounded. It's the Cavalry!

497
01:02:43,015 --> 01:02:44,683
I'm Judge Fuller!

498
01:02:45,309 --> 01:02:47,102
You're making a mistake.

499
01:02:47,811 --> 01:02:49,396
I'm Judge Fuller!

500
01:02:50,064 --> 01:02:51,482
I'm editor of the Gazette!

501
01:03:01,033 --> 01:03:03,035
I've captured Colorado!

502
01:03:03,243 --> 01:03:06,538
Don't shoot! I've captured Colorado!

503
01:03:07,498 --> 01:03:09,124
Don't shoot!

504
01:04:16,150 --> 01:04:19,194
I've got old man Adams here.
Don't shoot, please!

505
01:05:03,405 --> 01:05:05,741
Riding in this country without a gun?

506
01:05:07,367 --> 01:05:08,660
Very reckless.

507
01:05:10,954 --> 01:05:13,290
I knew we could depend on you.

508
01:06:47,509 --> 01:06:48,677
Miss?

509
01:06:54,058 --> 01:06:55,434
Leave her alone.

510
01:06:57,770 --> 01:06:59,229
I mean leave her.

511
01:07:00,314 --> 01:07:03,442
No. We're back to the way things were.

512
01:07:04,568 --> 01:07:07,029
You gave her to me, don't you remember?

513
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:10,741
We're short of water
and she's slowing us up.

514
01:07:12,951 --> 01:07:14,453
So leave her.

515
01:07:26,507 --> 01:07:28,717
- Get out of the way.
- No.

516
01:07:40,687 --> 01:07:42,981
I'm not much good to you dead.

517
01:07:43,273 --> 01:07:47,986
Has it crossed your mind that
you'll never see that canyon if you kill me?

518
01:07:48,112 --> 01:07:52,199
I won't kill you, but I'll hurt you awful bad.

519
01:07:53,367 --> 01:07:55,244
So get out of the way.

520
01:07:57,538 --> 01:07:59,581
There's plenty of water.

521
01:08:00,165 --> 01:08:02,459
Less than two hours from here.

522
01:08:04,545 --> 01:08:06,380
Are you crazy?

523
01:08:06,964 --> 01:08:09,425
Just keep your eye on the dealer.

524
01:08:55,637 --> 01:08:56,722
You're good.

525
01:08:57,973 --> 01:08:59,767
You're really good.

526
01:09:01,393 --> 01:09:04,146
- For this I give you Monkey's share.
- Yeah.

527
01:09:13,739 --> 01:09:15,491
Come on, enjoy!

528
01:09:31,882 --> 01:09:35,260
Mr. Mackenna, I want to thank you...

529
01:09:36,053 --> 01:09:37,638
...for everything.

530
01:09:37,888 --> 01:09:39,598
That's all right.

531
01:09:40,307 --> 01:09:43,894
Your father and I never had
much to say to each other...

532
01:09:43,977 --> 01:09:45,646
...but he was a good man.

533
01:09:45,729 --> 01:09:47,564
That's lucky for me.

534
01:10:20,180 --> 01:10:24,476
Excuse me, but is there something
between you and that Indian girl?

535
01:10:24,852 --> 01:10:26,019
No.

536
01:10:26,812 --> 01:10:28,897
There was a long time ago.

537
01:10:29,648 --> 01:10:33,569
Then after I got the marshal's job,
I had to go out and collect her brother.

538
01:10:33,652 --> 01:10:35,529
Then he got himself hanged.

539
01:10:36,155 --> 01:10:38,907
Don't make her mad. She's kind of crazy.

540
01:10:48,292 --> 01:10:50,169
Why aren't you married?

541
01:10:51,003 --> 01:10:55,174
I guess I never found a man
who could hold a candle to my father.

542
01:10:55,924 --> 01:10:57,384
I guess not.

543
01:10:58,010 --> 01:11:00,888
Hey, what's the matter with you?
You like to be dirty?

544
01:11:05,684 --> 01:11:08,771
Show you a new way
to get your clothes clean.

545
01:11:19,865 --> 01:11:22,785
I'll never understand the gringo, never.

546
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:58,088
It's all your fault.

547
01:12:58,756 --> 01:13:01,967
You know Hesh-ke.
You know she has a terrible temper.

548
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:47,823
I'm sorry. If Hesh-ke's got her mind
made up to kill that girl, she'll do it.

549
01:14:47,906 --> 01:14:50,784
You gave her to me
and I don't want her damaged.

550
01:14:51,326 --> 01:14:53,704
I can't watch her every minute.

551
01:15:49,551 --> 01:15:53,222
What's the matter with you?
We've got enough partners now.

552
01:15:53,806 --> 01:15:57,309
Besides, this will keep those Apache
happy for awhile.

553
01:17:02,666 --> 01:17:04,084
Some scout.

554
01:17:41,997 --> 01:17:45,584
The man leading that Cavalry patrol
was Sergeant Tibbs.

555
01:17:46,376 --> 01:17:50,923
"Foxy" Tibbs his men called him.
He knew his way around.

556
01:18:02,434 --> 01:18:07,648
Old "Foxy" Tibbs and his eight men
just kept followin' on.

557
01:18:18,075 --> 01:18:21,578
At the end of the first day,
he sent two men back to the company...

558
01:18:21,703 --> 01:18:24,790
...so they could show
the lieutenant the trail.

559
01:18:25,207 --> 01:18:32,297
And every day after, he kept sending
two more men back, in kind of a relay.

560
01:18:33,715 --> 01:18:39,513
And he hung on their heels, fast or slow.

561
01:18:47,146 --> 01:18:51,900
Finally, it was five against five.

562
01:19:35,569 --> 01:19:37,946
You two in the back, get going.

563
01:19:47,164 --> 01:19:48,248
Good.

564
01:19:49,333 --> 01:19:52,044
Now we can double back
and take them one by one.

565
01:19:52,127 --> 01:19:54,046
Yeah, that's good.

566
01:19:54,338 --> 01:19:57,466
When they see us comin',
they can turn around...

567
01:19:57,549 --> 01:20:01,637
...and lead us right back into the arms
of the whole company two by two.

568
01:20:02,304 --> 01:20:05,391
Of course, they won't hang me.

569
01:20:10,062 --> 01:20:14,525
Now I'll tell you what you can do.
Send the girl back to the troopers.

570
01:20:15,859 --> 01:20:19,154
- Why?
- Well, for one thing, she holds us up.

571
01:20:19,238 --> 01:20:23,283
They wouldn't be able to keep up with us
if they had her on their hands.

572
01:20:24,785 --> 01:20:26,036
No.

573
01:20:26,954 --> 01:20:30,040
All right.
You've probably got a better idea.

574
01:20:34,545 --> 01:20:36,672
No. I have no better idea.

575
01:20:38,924 --> 01:20:42,261
- Only this one better work.
- It'll work.

576
01:20:42,344 --> 01:20:45,431
- I'll tell her.
- Sure, you tell her.

577
01:20:51,729 --> 01:20:53,856
- I can tell her.
- I know.

578
01:20:54,189 --> 01:20:55,441
Miss.

579
01:20:56,066 --> 01:20:59,987
You're free to go over there and
join the soldiers. They'll get you home.

580
01:21:00,070 --> 01:21:02,531
It wouldn't be fair
to leave you here all alone.

581
01:21:02,656 --> 01:21:05,284
He's not alone. He's got me.

582
01:21:06,368 --> 01:21:08,579
I think I should stay, Mr. Mackenna.

583
01:21:08,662 --> 01:21:11,665
Look, lady,
you'd better go before I change my mind.

584
01:21:11,749 --> 01:21:14,752
I'll come by for supper
some night when I get back.

585
01:21:14,877 --> 01:21:16,128
Now git!

586
01:21:41,612 --> 01:21:44,782
Stay here. And keep your eyes open.

587
01:22:48,887 --> 01:22:51,432
Well, that gets rid of her, anyway.

588
01:23:18,792 --> 01:23:22,171
You've had a hard time, Miss Bergerman.
You have my sympathy.

589
01:23:22,254 --> 01:23:27,134
Thank you. Sergeant, you will be able
to do something about Mr. Mackenna?

590
01:23:27,801 --> 01:23:29,595
Yes, I think I can.

591
01:23:44,359 --> 01:23:46,987
Now there were only four of them left.

592
01:23:47,362 --> 01:23:50,616
That made the odds a little better
for Mackenna.

593
01:23:51,408 --> 01:23:54,161
Only thing was Hesh-ke had ideas.

594
01:23:54,828 --> 01:23:56,955
She wanted Mackenna back now.

595
01:23:59,208 --> 01:24:03,670
And now the girl was gone,
she figured there was nothin' to stop her.

596
01:24:04,588 --> 01:24:05,839
Thanks.

597
01:24:39,873 --> 01:24:42,709
Mackenna, don't make her mad.

598
01:24:51,927 --> 01:24:54,221
Colorado, someone comes.

599
01:25:12,614 --> 01:25:14,366
Stop! Now!

600
01:25:17,286 --> 01:25:19,496
Take it easy. I'm coming in.

601
01:25:21,749 --> 01:25:23,250
Take it slow.

602
01:25:35,387 --> 01:25:37,181
Stay where you are.

603
01:25:39,892 --> 01:25:43,812
I've come to join up.
I hope there won't be any trouble about it.

604
01:25:44,730 --> 01:25:47,024
- You expect us to believe that?
- Don't!

605
01:25:47,107 --> 01:25:50,944
He's a murderer.
He killed two men, his own men.

606
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:52,821
That's right.

607
01:25:53,072 --> 01:25:55,616
That's right.
That means I have two extra horses.

608
01:25:55,741 --> 01:25:59,828
Good horses. They'll come in
real handy when we find the gold.

609
01:26:01,163 --> 01:26:04,666
Oh, yes, the little lady here
told me all about it.

610
01:26:04,750 --> 01:26:08,170
Of course, I already had
a pretty good idea from the squaw.

611
01:26:10,756 --> 01:26:13,550
All right. But you're a foolish man.

612
01:26:13,759 --> 01:26:17,346
Suppose we say okay now and sometime
in the night we change our minds?

613
01:26:17,429 --> 01:26:20,140
Tonight, tomorrow night,
you got to sleep sometime.

614
01:26:20,224 --> 01:26:23,811
I'll get my sleep.
There's no point in your killing me.

615
01:26:24,228 --> 01:26:26,605
Not for one share, more or less.

616
01:26:26,897 --> 01:26:29,566
- Besides, you need me.
- Oh, no.

617
01:26:29,650 --> 01:26:32,736
We don't need you.
We've got enough trouble without you.

618
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:36,949
The Army'll be looking for you. They'd be
more anxious to hang you than me.

619
01:26:37,032 --> 01:26:41,537
No. They'll think you did it, or Apache,
and I was taken prisoner.

620
01:26:41,912 --> 01:26:44,790
During all this time
that I've been chasing you around...

621
01:26:44,873 --> 01:26:48,210
...l've thought it all out.
Yeah, you do need me.

622
01:26:50,170 --> 01:26:53,924
You know how much gold weighs?
You especially, Mr. Mackenna.

623
01:26:54,299 --> 01:26:57,636
How much is there? $1,000,000?
More? In raw gold.

624
01:26:58,137 --> 01:27:00,514
There's not enough of us here
to carry it out.

625
01:27:00,597 --> 01:27:04,351
But with me, you've got a better chance
of getting there and out alive.

626
01:27:07,020 --> 01:27:10,441
You're right, Sergeant.
You're welcome, Sergeant.

627
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:13,444
Coffee for the sergeant.

628
01:27:15,237 --> 01:27:18,824
Only don't forget, I'm the captain.

629
01:27:23,162 --> 01:27:25,998
A sergeant who kills
two of his own troopers.

630
01:27:26,081 --> 01:27:28,959
- What do you think of that?
- Not a hell of a lot.

631
01:27:29,543 --> 01:27:34,173
Now, be reasonable, Mackenna.
Oh, thank you.

632
01:27:34,590 --> 01:27:39,303
After all, a man of my age and rank,
there's no future for me in the Army.

633
01:27:39,595 --> 01:27:41,221
Do you mind, Sergeant?

634
01:27:41,889 --> 01:27:44,516
Why don't you stay
with your new partners?

635
01:27:45,976 --> 01:27:48,896
No hard feelings I hope, Miss Bergerman.

636
01:27:58,405 --> 01:27:59,907
Easy, friend.

637
01:28:02,034 --> 01:28:04,328
Mackenna's too precious to me.

638
01:28:09,958 --> 01:28:11,752
Miss Bergerman?

639
01:28:13,420 --> 01:28:17,549
Could it be that she's the little girl
of my old friend, the judge?

640
01:28:19,134 --> 01:28:23,389
Mackenna, we'll never be true friends
if you keep secrets from me.

641
01:28:27,684 --> 01:28:29,019
Let's go.

642
01:29:03,137 --> 01:29:07,391
To get away from the Cavalry,
they headed for the ferry on Yellow River.

643
01:29:07,474 --> 01:29:10,561
They figured they could cross over
on the raft there...

644
01:29:10,644 --> 01:29:12,938
...and then double back on the trail later.

645
01:29:13,063 --> 01:29:14,940
But what they didn't know was...

646
01:29:15,023 --> 01:29:19,194
...that the Apaches had taken over
the whole Yellow River territory.

647
01:30:01,487 --> 01:30:03,947
And there was another thing
they didn't know:

648
01:30:04,031 --> 01:30:06,825
Some other Apaches
had already burned down the ferry.

649
01:30:06,909 --> 01:30:10,579
But they had been in a hurry,
and the raft was still afloat.

650
01:30:10,746 --> 01:30:12,498
They still had a chance.

651
01:31:46,717 --> 01:31:49,344
Help me! The current's too strong!

652
01:35:00,327 --> 01:35:01,995
Get out of here!

653
01:35:16,093 --> 01:35:17,803
Damn Prairie Dog!

654
01:35:19,263 --> 01:35:22,766
And don't you go saying
we ought to take him with us.

655
01:35:40,033 --> 01:35:41,869
All right, let's go.

656
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:47,309
Now they were there. They'd reached it.

657
01:36:48,060 --> 01:36:51,897
They'd reached the place
Mackenna knew as Shaking Rock.

658
01:36:56,276 --> 01:36:57,694
We're here.

659
01:37:04,952 --> 01:37:06,620
Where's the canyon?

660
01:37:08,872 --> 01:37:11,083
Tomorrow. At sunrise.

661
01:37:12,418 --> 01:37:13,585
Who says?

662
01:37:15,754 --> 01:37:17,214
The map says.

663
01:38:03,677 --> 01:38:07,014
- You nervous?
- No. Just thinking.

664
01:38:07,890 --> 01:38:09,224
Mackenna.

665
01:38:10,684 --> 01:38:16,023
- So we'll get into that canyon tomorrow...
- Not we, Sergeant. I'm not going in.

666
01:38:16,398 --> 01:38:17,566
Maybe.

667
01:38:18,358 --> 01:38:21,945
You might change your mind.
And you know as well as I do...

668
01:38:22,071 --> 01:38:25,407
...that Colorado's not going to share
the gold with anybody.

669
01:38:25,532 --> 01:38:27,659
You've had time to figure that out?

670
01:38:27,785 --> 01:38:32,748
Enough. Now look, Mackenna,
you and I, we ought to stick together.

671
01:38:33,457 --> 01:38:36,251
The way you stuck to your two soldiers?

672
01:38:54,937 --> 01:38:59,441
Well, this is where the map ends.
I expect you to keep your word.

673
01:39:02,027 --> 01:39:04,321
Show me the canyon and I will.

674
01:39:04,446 --> 01:39:08,492
Well, if it's anywhere around here,
you'll see it tomorrow morning.

675
01:39:08,784 --> 01:39:11,787
I want my guns. And I want the girl.

676
01:39:12,538 --> 01:39:13,539
Tomorrow.

677
01:39:13,664 --> 01:39:16,959
And if there's no gold,
I still get the guns and the girl.

678
01:39:20,337 --> 01:39:21,880
There is gold.

679
01:39:23,674 --> 01:39:27,261
You'll never know
if you shove that thing any farther.

680
01:39:29,847 --> 01:39:32,141
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

681
01:39:41,608 --> 01:39:44,570
What'll you do with it? Your share, I mean.

682
01:39:45,821 --> 01:39:47,406
That's my business.

683
01:39:48,699 --> 01:39:50,075
Well, all right.

684
01:39:50,451 --> 01:39:52,327
I know what you think.

685
01:39:54,204 --> 01:39:58,917
One big drunk in every stinking saloon
in Sonora, till it's all gone.

686
01:39:59,918 --> 01:40:04,214
- Is that all you think I want?
- That's the way it's always been with you.

687
01:40:04,465 --> 01:40:07,885
Sure, because there was never enough
for what I really want.

688
01:40:08,010 --> 01:40:14,016
But when I get the gold, they'll never see
Colorado around here again. Never.

689
01:40:15,309 --> 01:40:17,269
Good. Where will you go?

690
01:40:20,230 --> 01:40:21,231
Sorry.

691
01:40:26,737 --> 01:40:30,491
Maybe I will tell you. But if you laugh...

692
01:40:32,117 --> 01:40:33,118
I won't laugh.

693
01:41:21,125 --> 01:41:23,335
A millionaire in Paris.

694
01:41:26,338 --> 01:41:28,006
That's right.

695
01:42:12,342 --> 01:42:13,761
What is it?

696
01:42:14,136 --> 01:42:18,724
Well, for whatever it's worth, he says
he's going to let us go tomorrow morning.

697
01:42:19,016 --> 01:42:22,603
I don't know what's going to happen,
but from the minute you wake up...

698
01:42:22,728 --> 01:42:24,313
...you keep your eye on me.

699
01:42:24,396 --> 01:42:27,232
However it goes,
we're gonna have to move fast.

700
01:42:27,316 --> 01:42:30,277
Do we have to?
Can't we see the gold first?

701
01:42:31,612 --> 01:42:35,824
- There isn't any gold.
- But there was a map.

702
01:42:36,283 --> 01:42:40,788
You saw it. It brought us here. You said
we could see the canyon in the morning.

703
01:42:40,871 --> 01:42:43,832
- I heard you.
- I said a lot of things to keep us alive.

704
01:42:43,916 --> 01:42:48,796
I've been running the bluff of my life.
And tomorrow morning is the showdown.

705
01:42:49,421 --> 01:42:52,841
But we've come so far.
And then not even to see it.

706
01:42:53,801 --> 01:42:56,428
No, listen, my father wasn't rich.

707
01:42:56,845 --> 01:43:01,392
After my mother died, I wasn't only
his daughter, I was his ranch hand...

708
01:43:01,517 --> 01:43:04,269
...because we couldn't afford to keep one.

709
01:43:05,646 --> 01:43:10,442
But with my share,
I could buy a real ranch, a big one.

710
01:43:10,984 --> 01:43:14,363
If I had your place,
I wouldn't be the marshal for five minutes.

711
01:43:14,446 --> 01:43:15,697
You don't have to.

712
01:43:15,781 --> 01:43:18,450
With your share,
you can do anything you want to.

713
01:43:18,534 --> 01:43:20,994
You like to gamble.
Build a gambling house.

714
01:43:21,078 --> 01:43:23,997
- I'll be your partner.
- You're out of your mind.

715
01:43:24,081 --> 01:43:28,544
Now, wake up! Your share, my share,
there aren't going to be any shares.

716
01:43:28,627 --> 01:43:31,547
I know him.
He doesn't share with anybody.

717
01:43:43,976 --> 01:43:45,227
I'm sorry.

718
01:43:47,896 --> 01:43:49,690
I must be crazy.

719
01:43:51,859 --> 01:43:54,611
You've done so much for me. Everything.

720
01:43:56,071 --> 01:43:58,115
And I'm nothing but trouble.

721
01:44:00,743 --> 01:44:03,036
I don't know why you bother with me.

722
01:44:08,125 --> 01:44:11,378
I have to. We're partners.

723
01:45:48,851 --> 01:45:52,688
- Well, what happens?
- I never would have believed it.

724
01:45:55,023 --> 01:45:59,069
I think you're gonna see that canyon
in about a minute.

725
01:46:01,905 --> 01:46:04,908
- My guns.
- No, not until I see the canyon.

726
01:46:07,119 --> 01:46:09,913
All right. Look at the rock.

727
01:46:10,539 --> 01:46:12,291
Watch that shadow.

728
01:46:29,224 --> 01:46:31,769
- What makes this?
- I don't know.

729
01:46:32,561 --> 01:46:34,688
Might be a quartz deposit.

730
01:46:47,451 --> 01:46:48,452
Look!

731
01:46:51,371 --> 01:46:52,706
Come on!

732
01:47:28,700 --> 01:47:29,952
Up there!

733
01:51:15,094 --> 01:51:18,097
Mackenna! Look! I'm covered in gold.

734
01:51:18,180 --> 01:51:21,433
- Come on. We're getting out.
- Getting out? No, why?

735
01:51:21,517 --> 01:51:24,937
Listen to me. If we don't get away,
we're going to be killed.

736
01:51:25,020 --> 01:51:29,149
We're not staying, not for all the gold
in the world. So start climbing.

737
01:52:04,017 --> 01:52:07,146
No. No bullets. I take them all.

738
01:52:08,355 --> 01:52:09,982
- When?
- Last night.

739
01:52:10,274 --> 01:52:12,317
The spirits tell me what to do.

740
01:52:13,402 --> 01:52:17,406
This is Apache gold. They tell me...

741
01:52:18,449 --> 01:52:20,492
...kill everyone today.

742
01:52:20,909 --> 01:52:24,079
Even you, Colorado. You are not Apache.

743
01:53:25,808 --> 01:53:27,226
Don't look down.

744
01:53:27,684 --> 01:53:31,021
Keep going! Climb!

745
01:53:34,733 --> 01:53:37,194
Come on, keep going.

746
01:54:17,693 --> 01:54:20,070
Come on. Just a little further.

747
01:54:20,988 --> 01:54:22,239
You can do it.

748
01:54:25,701 --> 01:54:27,911
Come on, try. A little bit more.

749
01:54:47,931 --> 01:54:48,932
Come on.

750
01:54:52,102 --> 01:54:53,353
Come on, climb.

751
01:54:54,229 --> 01:54:55,606
Climb. Come on.

752
01:54:56,440 --> 01:54:57,608
I can't.

753
01:54:57,775 --> 01:54:58,609
Try!

754
01:56:01,588 --> 01:56:04,299
Goodbye, old friend. No more jokes.

755
01:57:01,356 --> 01:57:02,441
Mackenna!

756
02:05:49,843 --> 02:05:51,303
Goodbye, Mackenna.

757
02:05:52,971 --> 02:05:54,973
You know I'm coming after you.

758
02:05:58,602 --> 02:06:00,479
Stay away from me, Mackenna.

759
02:06:03,899 --> 02:06:07,820
Find a hole, old friend. Make it deep.

760
02:08:01,642 --> 02:08:03,685
