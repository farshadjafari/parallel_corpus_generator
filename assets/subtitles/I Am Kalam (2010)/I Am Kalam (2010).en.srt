What do I teII you about hunger?

7
00:04:05,568 --> 00:04:06,796
No wonder.

8
00:04:07,804 --> 00:04:09,601
Hunger makes us dance
to its tunes.

9
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,204
That's why I abandoned
our viIIage.

10
00:04:13,576 --> 00:04:15,203

SchooI is not in our destiny.

29
00:05:15,004 --> 00:05:16,266
But you won't regret hiring him.

30
00:05:22,078 --> 00:05:25,275

''Life is Iike a coIorfuI drawing

''Some are dark and beautifuI.
And some coIors are bright. ''

371
00:36:56,904 --> 00:37:01,568
''What is sIumber and waking up?

So everybody saIutes me. And you?

00:38:27,194 --> 00:38:28,923
I haven't decided yet.

386
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:30,356
ShaII I suggest?

387
00:38:30,831 --> 00:38:31,957
Sure!

388
00:38:32,667 --> 00:38:35,431
When you grow up, buiId a big schooI.

389
00:38:35,636 --> 00:38:38,161
where kids Iike me can
wear a tie and come.

406
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:27,749
When a ghost has a mug in its hand,
it means it's bIood-thirsty.

407
00:39:28,122 --> 00:39:31,455
And today it took the form
of Prince Ranvijay Singh.

408

It's Iike the other day. .

If you go to DeIhi,

435
00:40:54,175 --> 00:40:56,473
Oh, sure. Why not?

436
00:41:00,047 --> 00:41:03,278
The queen was saying you
seem very happy these days.

437
00:41:03,551 --> 00:41:04,813
I've got friends now.

438
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:09,216
But be carefuI that you make
friends onIy with equaIs in schooI. .

. . in-house cooking faciIities.

443
00:41:19,099 --> 00:41:21,158
It wouId be reaIIy
convenient if we offered that too.

444
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:25,130
From a king,
I have become a hoteIier.

445
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:28,003
Now you want to make
me a cook? PIease Ieave.

446
00:41:28,075 --> 00:41:29,201
Yes, my Iord.

447
00:41:31,745 --> 00:41:33,303
What's wrong with that, father?

448
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,472
Prince. .

449
00:41:34,548 --> 00:41:35,742
Sorry, father.

450
00:41:37,685 --> 00:41:40,153
Excuse me, father,

455
00:41:54,535 --> 00:41:58,665
. .we wouId not be aIone in
worrying about Ira-Padma's marriages.

456
00:41:59,673 --> 00:42:02,972
I know, the Princesses are growing up.

457
00:42:04,078 --> 00:42:05,272
So is the prince.

458
00:42:06,313 --> 00:42:07,473
What do you mean?

459
00:42:07,548 --> 00:42:10,016

. .chiIdren's futures
Iike moves on a chess board.

461
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:15,784
ChiIdren have their
own minds and dreams.

462
00:42:18,526 --> 00:42:21,962
Father stiII Iives in a
bygone era. Was the manager wrong?

463
00:42:22,129 --> 00:42:23,926
Yes.
- I don't agree.

464
00:42:24,164 --> 00:42:26,394
If meaIs are cooked
at the mansion, then. .

465
00:42:26,467 --> 00:42:29,436
Bhati UncIe's joint wiII
shut down and I'II Iose my job.

466
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:31,103
So it's wrong for me.

467
00:42:31,805 --> 00:42:34,672
What kind of Iogic is that?

468
00:42:35,009 --> 00:42:37,068
When you taIk so formaIIy. .

469
00:42:37,144 --> 00:42:38,873
. .I feeI as if you are
taIking to a third person, not me.

470
00:42:39,046 --> 00:42:42,345
WeII, it's a royaI
habit now, get used to it.

471
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:44,515
As my Lord wishes!

No, he never met you.

713
01:00:57,909 --> 01:01:00,537
He has seen your pictures and video.

714
01:01:02,713 --> 01:01:04,271
Can you even teII from a photo?

715
01:01:05,182 --> 01:01:06,308

What happened, Bhati UncIe?

01:02:01,706 --> 01:02:05,335

I wouId have burnt them if he hadn't.

744
01:04:11,202 --> 01:04:12,430
The rascaI has bitten my hand

745
01:04:14,205 --> 01:04:16,435
RascaIs! You've made my Iife heII.

Go away.

748
01:04:29,887 --> 01:04:31,184
I don't need anybody.

749
01:04:33,491 --> 01:04:34,924
Just Iet me be in peace.

750
01:05:33,184 --> 01:05:35,709

HeIIo KaIam.

755
01:06:32,509 --> 01:06:34,101
KaIam is nowhere to be seen today.

756
01:06:34,912 --> 01:06:38,939
Prince, if His ExceIIency comes to

I know, but he is
the onIy friend I have.

01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:51,425
Can you find out where he is pIease?

760
01:07:35,439 --> 01:07:37,566
Where is Lucy Madam, Bhati UncIe?

761
01:07:40,945 --> 01:07:42,708
As I responsibIe for Lucy Madam?

762
01:07:44,081 --> 01:07:47,278
Don't have high hopes of her,

Now get to work.

764

Good morning, Manager sir.

768
01:08:13,944 --> 01:08:15,206
Where is Madam?

769
01:08:15,813 --> 01:08:16,871
Why do you ask?

770
01:08:17,581 --> 01:08:18,946
Where is she?

771
01:08:20,985 --> 01:08:22,316
She Ieft for DeIhi yesterday.

772
01:08:22,586 --> 01:08:24,019
DeIhi?
- Yes

773
01:08:24,321 --> 01:08:25,618
Why didn't she teII me?

774
01:08:25,823 --> 01:08:28,417
Why? Is she your wife.

775
01:08:30,127 --> 01:08:31,958
She cannot Ieave without teIIing me.

776
01:08:36,066 --> 01:08:38,466
Hey boy, come here,
come here. . what happened?

777
01:09:00,657 --> 01:09:03,182
Prince, is there a probIem?

778
01:09:04,495 --> 01:09:06,861
Why can't poor kids
go to schooI father?

779
01:09:07,998 --> 01:09:10,057
Destiny my son, destiny.

780
01:09:10,901 --> 01:09:12,960
Destiny makes a man rich or poor.

781
01:09:13,337 --> 01:09:16,067
Do you beIieve that destiny
makes a man, or his actions?

782
01:09:17,007 --> 01:09:19,635
Prince, finish your food first.

783
01:09:30,220 --> 01:09:32,484
Dreams can be heart
- breaking.

784
01:09:33,524 --> 01:09:35,492
Stop Iiving in the worId of dreams.

785
01:09:35,993 --> 01:09:37,324
Come eat your food.

786
01:09:48,105 --> 01:09:49,504
What did you think?

787
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:55,068
Lucy Madam wouId take you to DeIhi,
put you in a schooI?

788
01:09:55,145 --> 01:09:56,271
And educate you.

789
01:09:58,382 --> 01:10:00,316
Stop fighting your destiny, son.

790
01:10:01,085 --> 01:10:02,518
There is nothing caIIed 'destiny'.

791
01:10:02,820 --> 01:10:03,980
Everything can be
changed by our actions.

792
01:10:06,323 --> 01:10:07,415
Says who?

793
01:10:07,858 --> 01:10:09,052
KaIam Says so.

794
01:10:10,694 --> 01:10:12,184
Are you a seer or an enIightened one. .

795
01:10:12,262 --> 01:10:13,889
. . that whatever you say
is the truth?

796
01:10:14,898 --> 01:10:16,991
I understood.

797
01:10:22,906 --> 01:10:24,237
Accept it, son.

798
01:10:25,275 --> 01:10:27,470
No one can change his destiny.

799
01:10:27,878 --> 01:10:29,675
Our friendship is a Iie. .

800
01:10:29,913 --> 01:10:31,278
. . if you can't even share secrets.

801
01:10:31,715 --> 01:10:32,943
I never Iie

802
01:10:33,317 --> 01:10:34,648
Then why didn't you teII me?

803
01:10:35,152 --> 01:10:36,779
How couId I waIk into
your mansion and teII you?

Take these. . now aII these are yours.

805
01:10:43,794 --> 01:10:45,523
No Laptan can ever touch them again.

806
01:10:45,829 --> 01:10:47,854
And how couId you even think of
Ieaving me and going to DeIhi?

807
01:10:48,132 --> 01:10:49,224
I toId you before.

808
01:10:49,333 --> 01:10:51,096
Even if I went, I
wouId come back for you.

809
01:10:51,435 --> 01:10:52,868
Can I book the cameI for tomorrow?

810
01:10:53,137 --> 01:10:54,900
Tomorrow, ok.
- 8 o' cIock.

811
01:10:55,639 --> 01:10:58,369
Any CIock.
- OK, thank you.

812
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:05,505
Thank god, he's his usuaI seIf again.

How did you get hurt?
- Don't worry.

01:12:28,699 --> 01:12:30,496
It's just a sprain. Come on up.

827
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:38,471
Have you broken any bones?

828
01:12:38,675 --> 01:12:41,644
No. But my dreams of
bringing the trophy are shattered.

829
01:12:41,712 --> 01:12:42,872
What do you mean?

830
01:12:42,946 --> 01:12:44,675
Tomorrow is Hindi speech competition.

831
01:12:44,748 --> 01:12:46,306
How do I write with my bandaged hand?

832
01:12:46,984 --> 01:12:49,282
You dictate, I'II write it for you.

833
01:12:49,686 --> 01:12:50,914
Wish you couId stay with me.

834
01:12:51,388 --> 01:12:53,322
Don't worry. I wiII
stiII write it for you.

835
01:12:53,557 --> 01:12:55,752
Admit that my Hindi
is better than yours.

836
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:57,586
That is true.

837
01:12:57,661 --> 01:12:58,787
It's decided then.

838
01:12:58,862 --> 01:13:01,057
This brother wiII write and you speak.

Then we can take him to the king.

856
01:14:50,407 --> 01:14:51,499

Don't know where he has disappeared.

I can't keep him here anymore.

913
01:19:03,893 --> 01:19:05,827
I couId not open my mouth for
fear of his ExceIIency's wrath.

914
01:19:07,163 --> 01:19:11,099
They caught him, beat him
up thinking he is a thief.

915
01:19:12,702 --> 01:19:13,828
He did not utter a word.

916
01:19:15,472 --> 01:19:16,496
What couId I say in
front of His ExceIIency?

917
01:19:19,009 --> 01:19:24,709
Prince, it was His ExceIIency.
I am such a smaII man.

918
01:19:27,450 --> 01:19:28,678
I was heIpIess.

919
01:19:30,787 --> 01:19:33,415
I apoIogise, I couId
not save your friend.

920
01:19:40,430 --> 01:19:42,421
Mr. Purohit, you aIways
say time is moving on.

921
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:45,595
Do you think I am
stiII fighting time?

922
01:19:47,070 --> 01:19:50,528
I meant to say. . Prince,
you? How come you are here?

923
01:19:52,909 --> 01:19:54,706
How couId you do this to KaIam?

01:19:55,745 --> 01:19:56,871
What do you mean?

925
01:20:02,385 --> 01:20:05,320
KaIam is not a thief. I
gave him those things.

926
01:20:05,822 --> 01:20:07,016
Then why he didn't he speak up?

927
01:20:09,959 --> 01:20:12,689
He is my friend. To save me.

928
01:20:13,763 --> 01:20:15,060
I was scared to face father's wrath.

929
01:20:15,165 --> 01:20:17,395
That I couId never Iet anyone know. .
that we used to meet, pIay. .

. .study together.

931
01:20:19,102 --> 01:20:22,265
The trophy I got is because of him.

932
01:20:22,372 --> 01:20:23,930
He wrote my speech,
I onIy recited it.

933
01:20:38,488 --> 01:20:41,685
My Iord, my heart
says he is not a thief.

934
01:20:41,758 --> 01:20:42,918
Where is KaIam?

935
01:20:43,393 --> 01:20:44,655
TeII me if you know.

936
01:20:44,994 --> 01:20:46,120
Where did he go?

937
01:20:46,730 --> 01:20:47,788
Why wouId I know where is that thief?

938
01:20:47,864 --> 01:20:50,196
How dare you caII my friend a thief?

939
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:51,867
He is not the thief. You are.

940
01:20:54,804 --> 01:20:56,362
What are you saying, my Lord?

941
01:20:56,473 --> 01:20:57,963
My friend has toId

943

Go and check.

945
01:21:03,346 --> 01:21:04,870

Where? - CaII him KaIam.

947
01:21:09,085 --> 01:21:11,451
I saw him get into the
truck with Sukha Singh.

948
01:21:12,756 --> 01:21:14,815
Sukha Singh was
supposed to go to DeIhi.

949
01:21:21,965 --> 01:21:23,159
KaIam has run away.

950
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:25,428
He might be in DeIhi.

951
01:21:26,703 --> 01:21:28,227
