1
00:02:29,113 --> 00:02:30,879
Like most living creatures,

2
00:02:31,467 --> 00:02:35,471
the pigeon quickly associates
the pressing of a lever with reward.

3
00:02:36,943 --> 00:02:40,593
But when a timer releases the seal
automatically every 20 seconds,

4
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:42,124
the pigeon wonders,

5
00:02:42,883 --> 00:02:45,355
"What did I do
to deserve this?"

6
00:02:46,974 --> 00:02:49,353
If it was flapping
its wings at the time,

7
00:02:49,388 --> 00:02:52,682
it will continue to flap
convinced that its actions

8
00:02:52,717 --> 00:02:55,922
have a decisive influence
on what happens.

9
00:02:56,056 --> 00:02:59,736
We call this
"pigeon superstition."

10
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:10,066
MR. NOBODY

11
00:03:12,998 --> 00:03:14,882
What did I do
to deserve this?

12
00:04:29,204 --> 00:04:32,147
How's it been going
since the last time?

13
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:42,530
- Do I know you?
- We see each other every week.

14
00:04:43,886 --> 00:04:46,123
I'm Dr. Feldheim.

15
00:04:47,456 --> 00:04:50,753
- And who are you?
- Nobody.

16
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,843
Nemo Nobody.

17
00:04:52,844 --> 00:04:56,147
That's an unusual name,
don't you think?

18
00:04:56,148 --> 00:04:59,880
Sometimes,
people call me Mr. Craft.

19
00:04:59,915 --> 00:05:01,057
Who?

20
00:05:01,408 --> 00:05:05,176
C-R-A-F-T.

21
00:05:06,183 --> 00:05:09,833
Can't Remember
A Fucking Thing.

22
00:05:15,737 --> 00:05:18,916
What was the first question
I asked you?

23
00:05:20,844 --> 00:05:24,494
- I don't know.
- Can you tell me how old you are?

24
00:05:25,624 --> 00:05:28,096
I'm 34.

25
00:05:28,627 --> 00:05:32,652
I was born in 1975.

26
00:05:32,687 --> 00:05:35,595
Would you mind
looking at your hands?

27
00:05:36,745 --> 00:05:39,100
You don't have to
if you don't want to.

28
00:05:41,835 --> 00:05:44,425
There's a mirror
in front of you.

29
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,732
No. I...

30
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:51,930
What year is this?

31
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,113
2009.

32
00:05:56,326 --> 00:05:58,327
I'm 34.

33
00:05:59,111 --> 00:06:04,420
I was born
February 9th, 1975.

34
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:10,107
So I guess, it must be
your birthday.

35
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:23,268
I'm 34.

36
00:06:24,924 --> 00:06:27,632
I'm 34!

37
00:06:30,001 --> 00:06:32,120
I've got to wake up!

38
00:06:32,953 --> 00:06:35,307
I've got to wake up!

39
00:06:54,085 --> 00:06:57,618
Don't, Nemo.
Sun hurts my eyes.

40
00:07:49,586 --> 00:07:50,645
Hey, buddy.

41
00:07:53,136 --> 00:07:56,096
Good morning, my little angels.

42
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,751
- Time for school, okay?
- Hmm.

43
00:08:00,102 --> 00:08:01,280
Come on.

44
00:08:01,511 --> 00:08:04,219
Elise, I'm gonna
take the kids to school.

45
00:08:26,054 --> 00:08:29,115
- Paul, keep it down.
- My name's not Paul.

46
00:08:31,182 --> 00:08:32,596
Paul?

47
00:08:35,526 --> 00:08:36,703
Daddy...

48
00:08:37,773 --> 00:08:39,069
Daddy...

49
00:08:41,192 --> 00:08:42,488
Daddy...

50
00:08:44,248 --> 00:08:46,249
Paul, don't wake your father.

51
00:08:49,075 --> 00:08:50,135
Elise.

52
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,891
It's me, Jean.

53
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,267
- Am I dead?
- Go back and play Paul.

54
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:03,878
- Who's Elise?
- I don't know anyone called Elise.

55
00:09:04,762 --> 00:09:07,428
You're so tired, Nemo.
You need to rest.

56
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:09,224
I'll turn the television
on for you.

57
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:11,108
I'm going inside...

58
00:09:11,404 --> 00:09:14,347
- The sun hurts my eyes.
- What?

59
00:09:15,236 --> 00:09:17,944
The sun hurts my eyes.

60
00:09:30,216 --> 00:09:33,468
Nemo, your friends are here.

61
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:48,847
Hello, Nemo.

62
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:52,351
How are you feeling today?

63
00:09:55,874 --> 00:09:58,330
Do you know who I am?

64
00:10:02,038 --> 00:10:05,034
We're all very worried about you, Nemo.

65
00:10:06,158 --> 00:10:09,584
Everyone wants you be back in the office soon.

66
00:10:30,133 --> 00:10:31,749
Mrs. Nobody.

67
00:10:55,293 --> 00:10:57,302
<i>This is Julian Marshall.</i>

68
00:10:57,483 --> 00:10:59,483
<i>Live from New New York hospital,</i>

69
00:10:59,653 --> 00:11:04,454
<i>where we're going to see the final episode
in our series, "The Last Mortals"</i>

70
00:11:04,587 --> 00:11:11,018
<i>Mr. Nobody is 117 years old
and he has not been telemorized!</i>

71
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,032
<i>Nor does he have one of these
marvelous stem-cell compatible pigs.</i>

72
00:11:18,433 --> 00:11:20,498
<i>Live on WWB,</i>

73
00:11:20,498 --> 00:11:25,989
<i>Mr. Nobody will be the last man
on Earth to die of old-age.</i>

74
00:11:26,913 --> 00:11:29,670
<i>- Mr. Nobody...
- The Last Mortal.</i>

75
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,192
<i>The last mortal.</i>

76
00:11:48,694 --> 00:11:50,318
Now, Doctor,

77
00:11:50,321 --> 00:11:53,598
no trace of his identity has been
found on the National Records.

78
00:11:53,633 --> 00:11:56,442
Nothing about his past.

79
00:11:56,443 --> 00:11:58,615
We do not know
who Mr. Nobody is.

80
00:11:58,650 --> 00:11:59,962
Neither does he.

81
00:11:59,997 --> 00:12:02,316
Our patient's memories
are confused,

82
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,783
<i>but it is not unusual
at his certain stage of illness...</i>

83
00:12:05,818 --> 00:12:09,450
<i>for very old memories
to re-emerge in great detail.</i>

84
00:12:10,937 --> 00:12:13,056
Let's try something new.

85
00:12:14,305 --> 00:12:16,732
I'm thinking
of an old technique.

86
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,969
I can't promise anything.

87
00:12:19,153 --> 00:12:22,449
Maybe snatches of memory
will come back.

88
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:24,760
Maybe nothing will happen.

89
00:12:25,941 --> 00:12:27,942
Are you willing to try?

90
00:12:36,009 --> 00:12:38,600
You are very relaxed.

91
00:12:40,373 --> 00:12:43,081
You hear only my voice.

92
00:12:44,001 --> 00:12:47,414
Your eyelids
are getting heavy.

93
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:51,796
Your arms and legs
are getting heavy.

94
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,461
I'm going
to count to three.

95
00:12:56,717 --> 00:12:58,718
When I say three...

96
00:13:00,841 --> 00:13:02,961
you will be asleep.

97
00:13:03,835 --> 00:13:04,542
One.

98
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:08,443
Two.

99
00:13:11,611 --> 00:13:14,554
Remember
the day you came here.

100
00:13:19,988 --> 00:13:21,284
Three.

101
00:13:22,436 --> 00:13:23,731
You're sleeping.

102
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:03,588
SLEEP.......

103
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:11,179
Remember even further back.

104
00:14:11,526 --> 00:14:13,408
When I say three...

105
00:14:14,124 --> 00:14:14,949
One...

106
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,696
Two...

107
00:14:19,244 --> 00:14:20,303
Three.

108
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,254
Remember.

109
00:14:28,853 --> 00:14:32,032
I can remember
a long time ago...

110
00:14:32,149 --> 00:14:33,915
Long before my birth.

111
00:14:38,982 --> 00:14:42,748
I was whizzing with those
who were not yet born.

112
00:14:47,398 --> 00:14:50,570
When we're not born yet,
we know everything.

113
00:14:50,605 --> 00:14:52,690
Everything that's will happen.

114
00:15:22,645 --> 00:15:23,874
When it's your time,

115
00:15:23,909 --> 00:15:27,406
the angels of Oblivion
place a finger on your mouth.

116
00:15:27,407 --> 00:15:28,686
Shh.

117
00:15:29,563 --> 00:15:31,682
It leaves a mark
on the upper lip.

118
00:15:33,295 --> 00:15:36,238
It means that
you have forgotten everything.

119
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:40,629
But the angels missed me.

120
00:15:49,043 --> 00:15:52,457
Then you have to find
a daddy and a mummy.

121
00:15:52,464 --> 00:15:54,499
It's not easy to choose.

122
00:15:54,534 --> 00:15:57,876
Blond and blue eyed.
It's all I'm asking.

123
00:15:57,911 --> 00:15:58,891
Andrew!

124
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:01,049
It would be nice to the little one
not to be all alone.

125
00:16:01,084 --> 00:16:02,252
You stay here.

126
00:16:02,287 --> 00:16:05,312
It's normal to think about babies
when you reach a certain age.

127
00:16:05,444 --> 00:16:06,725
Well, for women at least.

128
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,298
- It's the meaning of life...
- Of life. I had not finished yet, darling.

129
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:11,678
It's the meaning of life.

130
00:16:11,713 --> 00:16:13,914
It's not
that we want a kid.

131
00:16:14,426 --> 00:16:16,192
But we slept together.

132
00:16:16,254 --> 00:16:19,315
- It's an important experience.
- It's an important experience, yeah.

133
00:16:19,717 --> 00:16:22,895
I think it would help my husband
if we had a child.

134
00:16:23,058 --> 00:16:25,766
We'd call him George.
Right, George?

135
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,269
We had a dog, but he died.

136
00:16:44,195 --> 00:16:49,343
In the end, I chose them
because the lady smelled nice

137
00:16:49,378 --> 00:16:50,634
and the man said...

138
00:16:50,669 --> 00:16:52,872
Well, I can tell you
how we met.

139
00:16:53,567 --> 00:16:57,805
It was meant to be.
Have you heard of the Butterfly Effect?

140
00:17:55,892 --> 00:17:59,306
Once upon a time,
there was a daddy and a mommy

141
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:02,464
named "The Daddy"
and "The Mommy".

142
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:04,229
They found a cute little baby

143
00:18:04,476 --> 00:18:07,540
and called it
"The Cute Little Baby".

144
00:18:07,575 --> 00:18:09,912
The little baby was born there.

145
00:18:09,947 --> 00:18:12,652
He was born that day,
and not another.

146
00:18:12,687 --> 00:18:16,537
His daddy and his mummy
live at number seven.

147
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:19,562
Everything you see exists.

148
00:18:19,982 --> 00:18:21,394
We can see it.

149
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:27,030
I can see Mummy's eyes.
But I can't see my eyes.

150
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:33,270
The little baby can see his hands,
but he can not see himself.

151
00:18:33,288 --> 00:18:36,520
So, does he really exist?

152
00:18:36,521 --> 00:18:38,464
Do I really exist?

153
00:18:39,509 --> 00:18:40,333
Boo.

154
00:18:44,838 --> 00:18:45,545
Boo.

155
00:18:46,637 --> 00:18:49,174
# Eenie meenie minie mo #

156
00:18:49,209 --> 00:18:51,547
# Catch a baby by the toe #

157
00:18:51,582 --> 00:18:53,897
# If he squeals let him go #

158
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:56,487
# Eenie meenie minie mo #

159
00:18:56,852 --> 00:19:00,184
# My mother told me
to pick the very best one #

160
00:19:00,219 --> 00:19:03,952
# And you are it #

161
00:19:11,139 --> 00:19:16,436
The Mummy has a brush for her hair
and lipstick for her lips.

162
00:19:16,437 --> 00:19:18,133
She smells good.

163
00:19:18,298 --> 00:19:21,830
The Daddy has a watch
and hair in his arm.

164
00:19:21,831 --> 00:19:24,376
The watch goes "tick-tock".

165
00:19:24,418 --> 00:19:28,656
If the baby falls,
the mother claps her hands.

166
00:19:28,742 --> 00:19:30,744
She says, "Bravo."

167
00:19:30,745 --> 00:19:31,745
Bravo.

168
00:19:41,863 --> 00:19:45,159
Why am I me,
and not someone else?

169
00:19:56,116 --> 00:20:00,560
<i>And so, high fresher fronts
moving in tomorrow.</i>

170
00:20:00,595 --> 00:20:03,200
<i>It will bring clear skies
for the whole weekend.</i>

171
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:06,026
<i>So, get those barbecues out.</i>

172
00:20:19,195 --> 00:20:20,255
Hello.

173
00:20:21,961 --> 00:20:25,910
Why do we remember the past,
but not the future?

174
00:20:25,945 --> 00:20:28,854
When you ask Mummy,
she says,

175
00:20:28,898 --> 00:20:30,900
- "Stop asking why."
- Stop asking why.

176
00:20:31,169 --> 00:20:33,288
- "It's complicated."
- It's complicated.

177
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:43,583
Yes.

178
00:20:52,572 --> 00:20:55,987
It's okay,
I'm--I'm a journalist.

179
00:20:57,456 --> 00:21:02,636
The hospital won't allow interviews.
I just like to ask you a few questions.

180
00:21:04,761 --> 00:21:08,058
A friend of mine's a nurse here.
She helped me get in.

181
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:10,644
What time is it?

182
00:21:11,951 --> 00:21:13,128
14:12.

183
00:21:15,363 --> 00:21:17,246
Where did you get that?

184
00:21:17,247 --> 00:21:19,990
I borrowed it
from the University Museum.

185
00:21:20,825 --> 00:21:22,238
But it still works.

186
00:21:22,797 --> 00:21:25,504
I've got nothing
to say to you.

187
00:21:25,698 --> 00:21:28,524
- I'm...
- I'm Mr. Nobody.

188
00:21:28,525 --> 00:21:30,842
The man who doesn't exist.

189
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:36,009
Do you remember what the world was like
before quasi-immortality?

190
00:21:36,272 --> 00:21:38,980
- What?
- Telemorization.

191
00:21:39,812 --> 00:21:41,696
Endless renewal of cells.

192
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,375
What was it like
when humans were mortal?

193
00:21:47,357 --> 00:21:50,654
There were cars
that polluted.

194
00:21:51,266 --> 00:21:56,564
We smoked cigarettes.
We ate meat.

195
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:02,511
We did everything we can do
in this dump and it was wonderful.

196
00:22:02,512 --> 00:22:07,857
Most of the time,
nothing happened...

197
00:22:08,814 --> 00:22:11,523
like a French movie.

198
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:17,454
And sexually?
Before sex became obsolete?

199
00:22:20,995 --> 00:22:22,643
We screwed!

200
00:22:24,127 --> 00:22:27,188
Everybody
was always screwing.

201
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:31,943
We fell in love.

202
00:22:33,471 --> 00:22:35,825
We fell in love.

203
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:44,210
What time is it?

204
00:22:46,771 --> 00:22:49,345
What was there
before the Big Bang?

205
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,640
Well, you see,

206
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:54,083
there was no before because
before the Big Bang,

207
00:22:54,154 --> 00:22:56,193
Time did not exist

208
00:22:56,228 --> 00:23:00,838
Time is a result of
the expansion of Universe itself,

209
00:23:00,873 --> 00:23:04,282
but what will happen when
the Universe has finished expanding...

210
00:23:04,317 --> 00:23:05,850
and the movement
is reversed?

211
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,840
What will be
the nature of time?

212
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,842
If String Theory is correct,

213
00:23:09,877 --> 00:23:13,647
the Universe possesses
nine spatial dimensions,

214
00:23:13,682 --> 00:23:15,648
and one temporal dimension.

215
00:23:15,709 --> 00:23:18,387
Now we can imagine that
in the beginning,

216
00:23:18,422 --> 00:23:20,896
all the dimensions
were twisted together

217
00:23:20,931 --> 00:23:23,251
and during the Big Bang,
three spatial dimensions,

218
00:23:23,252 --> 00:23:26,056
the ones that we know as
height, width and depth,

219
00:23:26,091 --> 00:23:30,420
and one temporal dimension,
what we know as time, were deployed.

220
00:23:30,455 --> 00:23:34,422
The other six remained miniscule,
wound up together.

221
00:23:34,641 --> 00:23:38,389
Now, if we live in a Universe
of wound dimensions,

222
00:23:38,424 --> 00:23:41,097
how do we distinguish
between...

223
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:43,623
illusion and reality?

224
00:23:43,951 --> 00:23:47,836
Time, as we know it, is
a dimension we experience

225
00:23:47,974 --> 00:23:49,975
only in one direction.

226
00:23:50,067 --> 00:23:53,717
But what if one of the additional
dimensions wasn't spatial,

227
00:23:53,982 --> 00:23:55,276
but temporal?

228
00:23:56,115 --> 00:23:59,647
If you mix the mashed potatoes
and sauce,

229
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:04,320
you can't separate them later.
It's forever.

230
00:24:04,346 --> 00:24:07,051
The smoke comes out
of Daddy's cigarette,

231
00:24:07,086 --> 00:24:09,405
but it never goes back in.

232
00:24:14,727 --> 00:24:16,846
We cannot go back.

233
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,776
That's why
it's hard to choose.

234
00:24:22,672 --> 00:24:25,733
You have to make
the right choice.

235
00:24:29,523 --> 00:24:35,527
As long as you don't choose,
everything remains possible.

236
00:24:44,343 --> 00:24:46,815
- Hello, Nemo.
- Hello, Anna.

237
00:24:46,834 --> 00:24:50,098
- Hi, Nemo.
- Hello, Elise.

238
00:24:50,133 --> 00:24:51,362
- Hello, Nemo.
- Hello, Jean.

239
00:24:55,565 --> 00:25:00,255
For as much as Anna and Nemo
have consented together in holy wedlock,

240
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:03,756
and have witnessed the same
before God and this company.

241
00:25:03,791 --> 00:25:08,464
For as much as Elise and Nemo have
consented together in holy wedlock...

242
00:25:08,499 --> 00:25:12,820
Jean and Nemo
have joined themselves...

243
00:25:13,244 --> 00:25:17,248
I pronounce that they be
husband and wife together...

244
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:22,807
Those who God has joined together,
no one can separate...

245
00:25:43,163 --> 00:25:47,417
Daddy says you can predict exactly
when Mars will be in the sky,

246
00:25:47,902 --> 00:25:49,758
even in 100 years.

247
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:51,492
But the funny thing is,

248
00:25:51,844 --> 00:25:53,969
that daddy does not know
what will happen to him

249
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,591
two minutes from now.

250
00:26:59,136 --> 00:27:00,136
Mama!

251
00:27:28,841 --> 00:27:31,217
That's not possible, no one knows the future.

252
00:27:31,286 --> 00:27:33,101
That's I, I remember it.

253
00:27:33,102 --> 00:27:35,197
You remember the past, not the future.

254
00:27:35,198 --> 00:27:36,849
Believe me. I can.

255
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:40,909
Sometimes things happen and I'm feeling
that they have already happened before.

256
00:27:45,069 --> 00:27:47,044
Well, that's deja vu.

257
00:27:47,881 --> 00:27:50,377
It happens to everyone from time to time.

258
00:27:50,378 --> 00:27:53,017
No! It's because of the Angels of Oblivion!

259
00:27:53,018 --> 00:27:55,447
They did not put their finger on me!

260
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,167
Come on!

261
00:28:05,969 --> 00:28:08,560
Get it! Grab on!

262
00:28:08,885 --> 00:28:10,887
One, two...

263
00:30:49,793 --> 00:30:53,710
Should Mr. Nobody be allowed
to die a natural death?

264
00:30:53,711 --> 00:30:58,779
Should his existence be artificially
prolonged? Make your vote now!

265
00:30:59,216 --> 00:31:01,528
Press X for artificial prolongation,

266
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:05,311
press 0 to let nature run its course.

267
00:31:05,424 --> 00:31:07,569
We'll be back after this!

268
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:10,425
You too can take a valley
vocation on Mars.

269
00:31:10,426 --> 00:31:13,483
Book before the Union
and save 16,000 inits.

270
00:32:28,236 --> 00:32:30,684
Okay, Anna, let's go.

271
00:32:44,154 --> 00:32:48,511
Then, the Daddy and the Mummy
kissed all day long.

272
00:33:12,584 --> 00:33:15,409
So, Nemo, have you
made up your mind?

273
00:33:16,597 --> 00:33:21,659
Do you want to come with me?
Or do you want to stay with your father?

274
00:34:33,849 --> 00:34:35,498
Nemo!

275
00:35:46,953 --> 00:35:49,307
I'm sorry,
I-I don't understand.

276
00:35:50,725 --> 00:35:54,375
Did you stay with your father
or go with your mother?

277
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:08,374
- Daddy, is it my fault?
- Of course not.

278
00:36:08,794 --> 00:36:10,561
It's my fault.

279
00:36:19,382 --> 00:36:23,502
I can give you a good deal
on this type of shoe lace.

280
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:29,854
A very good deal.

281
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:50,961
Remember.

282
00:37:07,043 --> 00:37:09,044
Remember.

283
00:37:13,502 --> 00:37:14,680
Nemo...

284
00:37:15,092 --> 00:37:16,270
Nemo.

285
00:37:20,344 --> 00:37:22,109
It's time to wake up, darling.

286
00:37:38,068 --> 00:37:41,028
And guess what?
You're going to be late for school.

287
00:37:54,704 --> 00:37:56,588
Nemo, it's me.

288
00:38:00,316 --> 00:38:02,670
I bet you haven't done
your homework.

289
00:38:02,672 --> 00:38:04,438
Hurry up and finish.

290
00:38:05,564 --> 00:38:07,566
I invited someone
for dinner.

291
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,823
I'm counting on you
to keep your mouth shut!

292
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:19,361
- How was the trip?
- Uh, it was good.

293
00:38:19,528 --> 00:38:24,002
- Have you seen some nice apartments?
- I did. I've seen a couple of nice ones.

294
00:38:25,735 --> 00:38:27,619
Nemo, don't stare
at people like that.

295
00:38:28,011 --> 00:38:30,393
It's okay.
It's not a problem.

296
00:38:30,428 --> 00:38:33,062
He has a gift for making people
uncomfortable.

297
00:38:33,097 --> 00:38:34,239
It's nothing.

298
00:38:35,489 --> 00:38:37,372
It will happen
on a Saturday...

299
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:40,801
You will be behind
the wheel of your car...

300
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:43,425
You are whistling...

301
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:49,276
You do not see
the crossroads...

302
00:38:50,417 --> 00:38:54,773
All of a sudden,
a train will appear from your left.

303
00:38:55,123 --> 00:38:57,124
And you will be crushed.

304
00:39:08,606 --> 00:39:10,607
You're not funny.

305
00:39:11,194 --> 00:39:14,138
Nemo thinks
he can predict the future.

306
00:39:15,547 --> 00:39:19,217
I can. I predicted Dad's accident.

307
00:39:19,218 --> 00:39:22,226
Yeah, I always wonded if you're not
the one who took off the handbrake.

308
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:26,226
No one can predict the future,
no one knows what's going to happen.

309
00:39:26,752 --> 00:39:28,164
I do.

310
00:39:29,061 --> 00:39:32,239
Well if you could, you'd know
you were going to get that.

311
00:39:33,258 --> 00:39:35,023
I knew you'd say that.

312
00:39:47,045 --> 00:39:48,708
Proud of yourself?

313
00:39:50,631 --> 00:39:54,175
Why you systematically ruin everything I...

314
00:39:54,671 --> 00:39:57,398
Do you think I have a right to live too?

315
00:40:07,729 --> 00:40:10,926
You could've stayed with your
father if you wanted to.

316
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,711
Everyone, please.

317
00:40:21,363 --> 00:40:24,074
I would like to introduce you
a new student in our class.

318
00:40:24,074 --> 00:40:25,690
Her name is Anna.

319
00:40:25,725 --> 00:40:27,220
Please Anna, take a seat.

320
00:40:27,678 --> 00:40:30,700
Alright,
let's turn to page 215.

321
00:40:30,735 --> 00:40:32,496
It's last night's reading.

322
00:40:32,531 --> 00:40:35,548
We're going to talk about
climate and vegetation zones

323
00:40:35,583 --> 00:40:39,236
and the elements of weather
that are involved in each of both zones.

324
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:43,215
There are five elements that
make up weather as we know it.

325
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:44,627
Atmosphere pressure...

326
00:41:01,602 --> 00:41:02,425
You're going to swim?

327
00:41:04,844 --> 00:41:06,610
- Come on, the water's nice.
- No, I...

328
00:41:08,912 --> 00:41:11,503
Come swim with us.
They're my friends, c'mon.

329
00:41:12,692 --> 00:41:13,869
They're idiots.

330
00:41:15,088 --> 00:41:17,090
And I don't go
swimming with idiots.

331
00:41:20,884 --> 00:41:22,061
Jerk.

332
00:41:32,116 --> 00:41:37,297
What on Earth made me say,
"I don't go swimming with idiots"?

333
00:41:50,463 --> 00:41:51,405
Anna.

334
00:41:51,899 --> 00:41:52,841
Nemo.

335
00:41:53,376 --> 00:41:54,436
Yeah.

336
00:41:55,694 --> 00:41:56,989
How have you been?

337
00:41:58,022 --> 00:41:59,082
I'm fine.

338
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:00,468
How are you?

339
00:42:01,382 --> 00:42:03,148
Yeah, good.

340
00:42:03,609 --> 00:42:05,375
Are these your kids?

341
00:42:06,372 --> 00:42:07,077
Yeah.

342
00:42:14,147 --> 00:42:16,737
Well, I'll see you around.

343
00:42:18,326 --> 00:42:19,267
Yeah, uh...

344
00:42:19,834 --> 00:42:21,601
I'll see you around.

345
00:42:33,071 --> 00:42:38,251
What on Earth made me say,
"I don't go swimming with idiots"?

346
00:43:06,423 --> 00:43:07,600
You're going to swim?

347
00:43:08,233 --> 00:43:09,999
- Come on, the water's nice.
- No, I...

348
00:43:15,695 --> 00:43:17,579
I don't know how to swim.

349
00:43:17,811 --> 00:43:18,871
Sorry?

350
00:43:20,503 --> 00:43:22,152
I don't know how to swim.

351
00:43:23,729 --> 00:43:25,024
That's it.

352
00:43:26,565 --> 00:43:28,214
Please don't tell anyone.

353
00:43:30,468 --> 00:43:31,764
Hey, aren't you gonna swim?

354
00:43:32,741 --> 00:43:35,920
No, I've got my period.
I'm gonna stay here.

355
00:43:36,042 --> 00:43:37,926
Nemo will keep me company.

356
00:43:37,927 --> 00:43:38,388
Okay.

357
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:13,009
Darling? I... I want to
introduce you to someone.

358
00:44:13,193 --> 00:44:15,665
- You've already met Harry.
- Hey.

359
00:44:15,666 --> 00:44:20,416
And this is his daughter, Anna.
Anna, this is Nemo.

360
00:44:30,889 --> 00:44:33,008
Why don't you shake hands?

361
00:44:51,903 --> 00:44:53,197
How was work today?

362
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,788
Ugh, I can't believe them.

363
00:45:16,789 --> 00:45:19,144
Soon as I wonder
how old they are.

364
00:45:23,009 --> 00:45:25,011
They already slept together?

365
00:45:25,274 --> 00:45:26,569
I don't know.

366
00:45:27,801 --> 00:45:28,941
I hope they use condoms.

367
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:32,120
I do not want to end up
with a little brother.

368
00:45:33,622 --> 00:45:35,271
I'd rather die.

369
00:45:35,355 --> 00:45:36,886
Is you mom on the pill?

370
00:45:38,295 --> 00:45:39,472
I have no idea.

371
00:45:41,092 --> 00:45:43,447
We should slip it
into her morning coffee.

372
00:45:43,503 --> 00:45:46,092
It's like her hormones
have gone to her head.

373
00:45:52,139 --> 00:45:54,258
Sometimes
I can see the future.

374
00:45:56,743 --> 00:46:00,511
It doesn't seem like it can be much fun
knowing what's going to happen.

375
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:24,334
You're still here.

376
00:46:25,967 --> 00:46:28,793
Did I fall asleep?

377
00:46:30,411 --> 00:46:33,824
Sometimes I don't sleep.

378
00:46:35,215 --> 00:46:36,863
So I think...

379
00:46:39,252 --> 00:46:42,195
I think about how it was.

380
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:47,260
It's all I have left.

381
00:46:50,988 --> 00:46:54,167
What do you see
when you look at me?

382
00:46:54,383 --> 00:46:58,716
A grumpy old man
who never answers questions?

383
00:46:58,751 --> 00:47:00,953
Who mixes everything up?

384
00:47:01,935 --> 00:47:06,999
Who is kept busy
by getting his meals?

385
00:47:08,723 --> 00:47:11,077
Now that's not me...

386
00:47:14,368 --> 00:47:15,545
Me...

387
00:47:18,142 --> 00:47:20,261
I wear shorts.

388
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:25,484
I'm nine years old.

389
00:47:27,035 --> 00:47:30,567
I can run faster
than the train.

390
00:47:33,127 --> 00:47:37,012
I can't feel
my aching back anymore.

391
00:47:38,858 --> 00:47:40,860
I'm 15.

392
00:47:43,654 --> 00:47:45,772
I'm 15.

393
00:47:47,561 --> 00:47:49,680
And I'm in love.

394
00:47:52,549 --> 00:47:54,432
I'm in love.

395
00:49:17,319 --> 00:49:18,144
Nemo?

396
00:49:19,876 --> 00:49:20,818
Nemo?

397
00:49:24,224 --> 00:49:25,402
Nemo?

398
00:49:32,012 --> 00:49:33,895
Isn't he sleeping
in the study?

399
00:49:34,377 --> 00:49:36,731
No, I just looked
and he isn't there.

400
00:49:37,388 --> 00:49:40,566
- Anna, have you seen your brother?
- He's not my brother.

401
00:49:51,213 --> 00:49:53,451
Oh, there you are.
Sleep alright?

402
00:50:18,401 --> 00:50:20,756
- Who's that?
- It's me.

403
00:50:22,932 --> 00:50:23,992
It's me, Dad...

404
00:50:24,408 --> 00:50:25,350
Nemo.

405
00:50:26,323 --> 00:50:27,382
Your son.

406
00:50:28,136 --> 00:50:29,902
Of course, son.

407
00:50:30,413 --> 00:50:33,710
- Where were you?
- At the shop, Dad.

408
00:50:34,506 --> 00:50:36,272
I always work at the shop
after school.

409
00:50:36,342 --> 00:50:40,817
You know, a boy your age
should get out more.

410
00:50:40,852 --> 00:50:44,096
You can leave me alone, you know.
I-I can manage.

411
00:50:44,131 --> 00:50:45,744
It's no problem, Dad.

412
00:50:46,588 --> 00:50:48,119
I like being at home.

413
00:51:17,846 --> 00:51:20,319
There was a card
from your mother in the post.

414
00:51:21,664 --> 00:51:25,784
- You have not read it.
- I know. I'll read it later.

415
00:51:25,785 --> 00:51:27,779
Won't you go
and see her one day?

416
00:51:28,642 --> 00:51:30,996
I haven't seen her
in seven years.

417
00:51:31,167 --> 00:51:33,993
If she ever wanted to see me,
she'd know where to find me.

418
00:51:37,691 --> 00:51:39,694
I've got everything
I need, Dad.

419
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,811
Everything's fine.

420
00:52:16,381 --> 00:52:18,500
After three months,

421
00:52:18,779 --> 00:52:21,016
and six days of travel...

422
00:52:24,342 --> 00:52:26,108
the shuttle was heading...

423
00:52:27,947 --> 00:52:31,715
directly toward
the Cancer nebula...

424
00:52:33,295 --> 00:52:35,767
in line with Uranus...

425
00:52:37,482 --> 00:52:39,366
and its five moons.

426
00:53:00,405 --> 00:53:03,466
It was finally aproaching
Mars and the Colonies.

427
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:10,349
Onboard...

428
00:53:11,107 --> 00:53:14,992
the computer was monitoring
the passengers' artificial hibernation

429
00:53:32,231 --> 00:53:33,527
Elise.

430
00:55:09,974 --> 00:55:11,741
I'm not crazy.

431
00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:13,933
Come on,
it's not that bad!

432
00:55:13,968 --> 00:55:16,876
I didn't say anything mean.

433
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:20,603
Shall we go, Nemo?

434
00:55:21,426 --> 00:55:24,371
- Excuse me?
- Shall we go? He's such a bore.

435
00:55:44,918 --> 00:55:46,213
You'll drown.

436
00:55:51,475 --> 00:55:55,948
- How do you know my name?
- We go to the same school.

437
00:55:56,808 --> 00:56:00,222
You never noticed me.
You never notice anyone.

438
00:56:06,379 --> 00:56:08,145
D'you have a girlfriend?

439
00:56:10,566 --> 00:56:13,039
What? Are you queer?
Why don't you have a girlfriend?

440
00:56:14,065 --> 00:56:15,596
I don't know...

441
00:56:16,402 --> 00:56:17,932
I-I don't want one.

442
00:56:20,789 --> 00:56:22,201
Tell me about yourself.

443
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,072
You used to piss your pants,
everyone knows you're weirdo.

444
00:56:30,482 --> 00:56:31,970
You're always alone...

445
00:56:35,813 --> 00:56:36,813
Talk.

446
00:56:39,786 --> 00:56:41,905
Or say something.
Come on...

447
00:56:47,565 --> 00:56:50,861
Gravity on Mars is 0.38.

448
00:56:53,808 --> 00:56:56,398
That's three times
less than on Earth.

449
00:56:58,251 --> 00:57:02,255
The ground is covered
with an iron oxide dust.

450
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:11,362
You're incredible.

451
00:57:14,242 --> 00:57:17,775
- Raise your hand and say "I swear."
- Why?

452
00:57:18,118 --> 00:57:22,592
Promise me that if I die,
you'll spread my ashes on Mars.

453
00:57:23,582 --> 00:57:27,112
It's estimated that travel to Mars
would take six to eight months.

454
00:57:27,147 --> 00:57:28,643
Say "I swear."

455
00:57:32,741 --> 00:57:33,683
I swear.

456
00:57:38,814 --> 00:57:40,933
We were neighbors
when we were little.

457
00:57:44,129 --> 00:57:45,306
It's Elise.

458
00:57:46,096 --> 00:57:47,273
Don't you remember?

459
00:57:48,172 --> 00:57:49,466
Elise.

460
00:57:50,312 --> 00:57:52,410
I had a feeling I've seen you or something.

461
00:57:52,411 --> 00:57:54,302
Yeah, that's called deja vu.

462
00:57:54,303 --> 00:57:57,359
- And the signal from the eyes
goes from the memory...

463
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:58,903
No, it's not it.

464
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:01,874
Another life then?

465
00:58:03,238 --> 00:58:04,416
Anyway...

466
00:58:05,785 --> 00:58:07,434
I remembered you.

467
00:58:20,873 --> 00:58:22,485
We shouldn't.

468
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:25,781
You don't know me
and I am not a good person.

469
00:58:25,921 --> 00:58:27,687
Why do you say that?

470
00:58:50,116 --> 00:58:52,587
- Elise, wait!
- I'll call you.

471
00:58:52,643 --> 00:58:54,763
You don't have
my phone number.

472
00:58:57,477 --> 00:59:00,067
What happens
when we fall in love?

473
00:59:01,290 --> 00:59:04,470
As a result
of certain stimuli,

474
00:59:04,471 --> 00:59:08,697
the hypothalamus releases
a powerful discharges of endorphins...

475
00:59:08,732 --> 00:59:12,980
but why exactly that woman
or that man?

476
00:59:13,015 --> 00:59:15,784
Is there a release of
odourless pheromones

477
00:59:15,819 --> 00:59:18,987
that correspond to
our complimentary genetic signal?

478
00:59:19,022 --> 00:59:22,542
Or is it physical feutures
that we recognize?

479
00:59:22,577 --> 00:59:24,662
A mother's eyes...

480
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:28,371
A smell that stimulates
a happy memory.

481
00:59:29,532 --> 00:59:33,298
Is love...
part of a plan?

482
00:59:33,383 --> 00:59:37,622
A vast war plan
between two modes of reproduction

483
00:59:37,682 --> 00:59:41,820
Bacteria and viruses
are asexual organisms.

484
00:59:41,855 --> 00:59:44,624
With each cell division,
each multiplication,

485
00:59:44,659 --> 00:59:47,636
they mutate and perfect themselves
much more quickly than we do.

486
00:59:47,671 --> 00:59:52,313
Against this, we respond
with the most fiercing weapon:

487
00:59:52,348 --> 00:59:53,490
Sex.

488
00:59:54,189 --> 00:59:57,367
Two individuals,
by mixing their genes,

489
00:59:57,391 --> 01:00:02,939
shuffle the cards and create an individual
who resists viruses better.

490
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:05,626
The more disimilar
he or she is.

491
01:00:05,661 --> 01:00:11,867
Now, are we unknowing participants in
a war between two modes of reproduction?

492
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,519
Okay everyone,
that's it for today.

493
01:00:20,288 --> 01:00:21,815
How was it?

494
01:00:22,131 --> 01:00:24,203
You want to know the truth?

495
01:00:24,204 --> 01:00:25,911
O'key. It was good. It was really good.

496
01:00:29,822 --> 01:00:32,059
- Hey, honey.
- I'm gonna be a little late.

497
01:00:32,138 --> 01:00:33,669
That's okay. Don't worry.

498
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:37,088
- I love you.
- I love you more.

499
01:00:37,089 --> 01:00:38,999
<i>- Me more.
- Me more.</i>

500
01:00:39,096 --> 01:00:41,215
- Okay
- Cheater.

501
01:00:41,979 --> 01:00:43,980
Alright, I'll see ya later.

502
01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:47,003
I always liked fish.

503
01:01:47,101 --> 01:01:50,634
I never thought that one day
they would like me too.

504
01:01:53,453 --> 01:01:55,219
You're very relaxed.

505
01:01:56,822 --> 01:02:00,000
Your eyelids
are getting heavy.

506
01:02:01,177 --> 01:02:03,178
Remember.

507
01:02:04,619 --> 01:02:06,268
Remember...

508
01:02:11,830 --> 01:02:14,066
Remember...

509
01:03:18,381 --> 01:03:19,381
Nemo...

510
01:03:19,382 --> 01:03:19,762
Shit.

511
01:03:19,928 --> 01:03:20,989
Anna...

512
01:03:23,727 --> 01:03:27,023
We've got errands to run.
We'll back in an hour.

513
01:03:29,883 --> 01:03:34,005
Anna, cover up!
You're gonna get a sunburn.

514
01:04:52,248 --> 01:04:53,661
I want you.

515
01:04:55,115 --> 01:04:56,528
I want you too.

516
01:04:58,951 --> 01:04:59,776
Forever.

517
01:05:03,217 --> 01:05:04,512
Forever.

518
01:05:05,387 --> 01:05:07,152
Whatever happens.

519
01:05:07,782 --> 01:05:09,784
There is no life without you.

520
01:05:10,733 --> 01:05:12,499
No life without you.

521
01:05:36,510 --> 01:05:38,394
You look like my son.

522
01:05:39,569 --> 01:05:41,218
I am your son, Dad.

523
01:05:41,888 --> 01:05:44,007
My son's taller than you.

524
01:05:59,733 --> 01:06:00,733
Elise

525
01:07:05,843 --> 01:07:07,257
Someone just came in.

526
01:07:09,118 --> 01:07:12,415
If I could at least
move my fingers.

527
01:07:13,633 --> 01:07:15,047
Or my eyes.

528
01:07:16,728 --> 01:07:18,612
Do you think he can hear us?

529
01:07:19,350 --> 01:07:21,234
Have you seen any reaction?

530
01:07:21,235 --> 01:07:22,392
I don't know, but...

531
01:07:22,876 --> 01:07:24,642
I've got a feeling
that he can.

532
01:07:24,643 --> 01:07:25,907
Who's there?

533
01:07:26,041 --> 01:07:27,336
What am I doing here?

534
01:07:27,861 --> 01:07:30,451
If you can hear me,
move your fingers.

535
01:07:30,505 --> 01:07:31,801
I've got to get out of here.

536
01:07:31,917 --> 01:07:34,390
Go back,
before the accident.

537
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:06,926
I believe one thing.

538
01:08:09,196 --> 01:08:14,375
I believe that we should always say
"I love you" to the people we love.

539
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:23,182
I love you.

540
01:08:31,026 --> 01:08:34,557
Nemo... we shouldn't.

541
01:08:36,189 --> 01:08:37,483
I love Stefano.

542
01:08:39,121 --> 01:08:39,828
What?

543
01:08:40,829 --> 01:08:43,302
You saw him
at the party with me.

544
01:08:45,384 --> 01:08:47,033
He doesn't love me.

545
01:08:48,714 --> 01:08:49,303
And so...

546
01:08:49,399 --> 01:08:50,695
I love him anyways.

547
01:08:51,458 --> 01:08:53,342
I can't help myself.

548
01:08:54,163 --> 01:08:55,575
I'm in love with him.

549
01:08:58,374 --> 01:08:59,316
I'm sorry.

550
01:09:12,065 --> 01:09:13,595
Dad, I'm getting married.

551
01:09:13,845 --> 01:09:14,669
Oh!

552
01:09:15,232 --> 01:09:16,999
And who is the lucky lady?

553
01:09:17,342 --> 01:09:18,401
No, it's not that.

554
01:09:19,977 --> 01:09:22,920
I'm gonna marry the first girl
who dances with me tonight.

555
01:10:01,092 --> 01:10:02,505
Thanks, Nemo.

556
01:10:39,735 --> 01:10:41,031
Nemo.

557
01:10:46,864 --> 01:10:50,984
On that day, I would make
a lot of foolish decisions.

558
01:10:52,275 --> 01:10:55,689
One, I will never
leave anything to chance again.

559
01:10:55,690 --> 01:10:58,505
Two, I will marry the girl
on my motorcycle.

560
01:10:59,014 --> 01:11:00,898
Three, I'll be rich.

561
01:11:01,102 --> 01:11:02,868
Four, we'll have a house.

562
01:11:03,262 --> 01:11:04,439
A big house!

563
01:11:04,529 --> 01:11:06,736
Painted yellow,
with a garden,

564
01:11:06,771 --> 01:11:09,207
and two children,
Paul and Michael.

565
01:11:09,208 --> 01:11:12,781
Five, I'll have a convertible--
A red convertible.

566
01:11:12,816 --> 01:11:15,253
And a swimming pool.
I'll learn to swim.

567
01:11:15,397 --> 01:11:19,399
Six, I will not stop
until I've succeeded.

568
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:41,855
Daddy?

569
01:11:44,089 --> 01:11:45,267
Daddy?

570
01:11:49,498 --> 01:11:51,500
Paul, don't wake your father.

571
01:11:52,398 --> 01:11:53,457
Elise?

572
01:11:54,026 --> 01:11:55,792
It's me, Jean.

573
01:11:58,308 --> 01:11:59,604
Who is Elise?

574
01:12:03,495 --> 01:12:05,378
I don't know
anyone called Elise.

575
01:12:06,082 --> 01:12:07,966
Go back and play Paul.

576
01:12:10,731 --> 01:12:13,439
Nemo, do I matter to you?

577
01:12:17,214 --> 01:12:18,156
I just...

578
01:12:18,390 --> 01:12:20,979
I just like
to ask you one question.

579
01:12:22,335 --> 01:12:24,337
Did you do it on purpose?

580
01:12:27,322 --> 01:12:30,030
I found this
on the bedside table.

581
01:12:31,065 --> 01:12:35,412
There comes a time in life
when everything seems narrow.

582
01:12:35,447 --> 01:12:40,121
Choices have been made
I can only continue on.

583
01:12:40,430 --> 01:12:43,491
I know myself like
the back of my hand.

584
01:12:44,537 --> 01:12:47,244
I can predict my every reaction.

585
01:12:47,245 --> 01:12:48,851
Everything is predictable.

586
01:12:49,550 --> 01:12:54,377
My life has been cast in cement
with airbags and seatbelts.

587
01:12:54,378 --> 01:12:56,290
I've controlled everything.

588
01:12:56,317 --> 01:13:00,909
I've done everything to reach
this point and now that I'm here,

589
01:13:01,161 --> 01:13:03,280
I'm fucking bored.

590
01:13:05,428 --> 01:13:08,843
The hardest thing is knowing
whether I'm still alive.

591
01:13:16,517 --> 01:13:18,753
It is my handwriting.

592
01:13:19,968 --> 01:13:21,969
I don't remember.

593
01:13:39,547 --> 01:13:40,372
Jean?

594
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:45,966
What did you say?

595
01:13:49,436 --> 01:13:50,849
I had a weird dream.

596
01:14:11,134 --> 01:14:14,341
Well, it's important for you to understand.

597
01:14:14,342 --> 01:14:17,958
In life things don't always turn out...

598
01:14:18,532 --> 01:14:20,374
as we plan them.

599
01:14:21,097 --> 01:14:22,880
Harry and I thought...

600
01:14:25,397 --> 01:14:27,512
Life isn't what we all think it will be.

601
01:14:28,241 --> 01:14:30,248
What are you talking about?

602
01:14:31,496 --> 01:14:32,675
I don't understand.

603
01:14:33,903 --> 01:14:35,669
Anna knows already.

604
01:14:38,615 --> 01:14:41,206
Harry and I
are going to separate.

605
01:14:42,681 --> 01:14:43,740
What?

606
01:14:45,311 --> 01:14:46,371
Why?

607
01:14:48,266 --> 01:14:51,916
- You have no right!
- Please, you played your part!

608
01:14:52,045 --> 01:14:54,165
I don't know what is going on
between you two

609
01:14:54,176 --> 01:14:56,648
and I don't wanna know.
It's sick!

610
01:14:56,778 --> 01:15:02,077
- You're brother and sister, for God's sake.
- We are not brother and sister!

611
01:15:08,804 --> 01:15:09,982
You knew!

612
01:15:11,564 --> 01:15:13,211
And you didn't tell me.

613
01:15:21,010 --> 01:15:22,304
Where are you going?

614
01:15:25,145 --> 01:15:26,559
To New York.

615
01:15:28,804 --> 01:15:31,040
In ten days.

616
01:15:32,578 --> 01:15:34,933
My father found a job there.

617
01:15:45,052 --> 01:15:47,406
Wait for me
near the lighthouse...

618
01:15:48,015 --> 01:15:50,135
every Sunday, okay?

619
01:15:51,886 --> 01:15:54,241
Until we see each other again.

620
01:15:54,346 --> 01:15:56,582
For life, okay?

621
01:16:00,226 --> 01:16:02,110
It's not over.

622
01:16:09,584 --> 01:16:13,234
You're the first and last person
I'll ever love.

623
01:16:14,876 --> 01:16:16,407
Ten days.

624
01:16:18,487 --> 01:16:19,429
That makes...

625
01:16:21,136 --> 01:16:22,784
14 thousand...

626
01:16:23,692 --> 01:16:25,576
400 minutes.

627
01:16:29,629 --> 01:16:32,337
I wish everything
would stop right now.

628
01:16:34,636 --> 01:16:36,992
Things would stay
this way forever.

629
01:16:39,877 --> 01:16:42,702
They say that
if you slow your breathing...

630
01:16:43,872 --> 01:16:45,638
time slows down.

631
01:16:47,699 --> 01:16:49,464
The Hindu say so.

632
01:17:30,279 --> 01:17:34,869
I have to remember the smell
of every part of your body.

633
01:17:44,481 --> 01:17:46,602
We'll meet
near the lighthouse.

634
01:18:10,301 --> 01:18:12,303
Anna, it's time to go.

635
01:18:22,686 --> 01:18:24,217
I love you.

636
01:19:07,983 --> 01:19:10,926
Anna!

637
01:19:46,536 --> 01:19:47,360
Anna...

638
01:19:48,539 --> 01:19:49,833
Can you hear me?

639
01:20:12,406 --> 01:20:14,172
We must look to the future.

640
01:20:14,976 --> 01:20:16,977
It will be good
to move house.

641
01:20:17,247 --> 01:20:18,542
Have a new life.

642
01:20:19,474 --> 01:20:20,888
Will we have a pool?

643
01:20:21,695 --> 01:20:24,168
You hate water.
You don't even swim.

644
01:20:24,843 --> 01:20:27,784
- You never know what you want.
- You know what I don't want?

645
01:20:27,819 --> 01:20:30,727
So tell me, what is it
you don't want?

646
01:20:32,876 --> 01:20:34,877
I don't want to be like you.

647
01:20:37,344 --> 01:20:38,875
You know nothing about me.

648
01:20:40,227 --> 01:20:42,111
I've always loved pools.

649
01:20:44,387 --> 01:20:46,153
When I'm older,
I'll have a pool.

650
01:21:42,055 --> 01:21:43,233
Anna.

651
01:21:44,756 --> 01:21:45,462
Anna.

652
01:21:47,642 --> 01:21:51,527
I feel like I'll be seeing you
at every street corner.

653
01:22:13,214 --> 01:22:15,687
Sometimes I tell myself...

654
01:22:16,376 --> 01:22:18,967
maybe you live
in the same town I do

655
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:21,046
and I don't know where.

656
01:22:21,379 --> 01:22:24,558
Maybe you're here,
very close.

657
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:28,654
Nemo, do you hear my voice?

658
01:22:30,730 --> 01:22:31,909
Anna!

659
01:22:33,359 --> 01:22:36,428
After 90 days,
the onboard computer

660
01:22:36,463 --> 01:22:39,137
is still maintaining
the passengers' metabolism

661
01:22:39,172 --> 01:22:41,609
at the level
of a hibernating frog.

662
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:09,959
He'd always been fascinated
by the fact

663
01:23:10,048 --> 01:23:13,477
that certain frogs can spend
the winter completely frozen.

664
01:23:13,512 --> 01:23:15,832
and that
when spring comes comma,

665
01:23:15,833 --> 01:23:20,024
they defrost
and begin living again period.

666
01:23:21,575 --> 01:23:23,694
The onboard computer displayed...

667
01:23:24,004 --> 01:23:26,359
"End of hibernation".

668
01:23:40,529 --> 01:23:42,295
<i>Welcome to Mars.</i>

669
01:23:42,799 --> 01:23:47,509
<i>We hope you had a pleasant dream
and a refreshing re-awakening.</i>

670
01:23:47,589 --> 01:23:52,203
<i>Please leave your sleep suits in
your suspended animation cubicles</i>

671
01:23:52,238 --> 01:23:55,617
<i>and make your way
through to the Arrivals lounge.</i>

672
01:23:57,264 --> 01:24:00,502
<i>You will be directed to
the rest and recoveration rooms</i>

673
01:24:00,537 --> 01:24:05,093
<i>to prepare for your first excursion
to the red planet itself.</i>

674
01:24:08,466 --> 01:24:11,158
Probably the worst thing
about being on Mars

675
01:24:11,193 --> 01:24:13,278
is that nothing
will happen there.

676
01:24:13,778 --> 01:24:16,134
Time will seem stole and empty.

677
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:20,151
That doesn't look
like there's much to do.

678
01:24:20,292 --> 01:24:22,411
I hope I brought enough
we took.

679
01:24:50,314 --> 01:24:51,256
Day time.

680
01:24:52,854 --> 01:24:54,150
It's day time.

681
01:24:55,989 --> 01:24:56,931
The sun is out.

682
01:24:58,561 --> 01:25:01,387
It's warmer on the right
than on the left

683
01:25:05,026 --> 01:25:09,617
She's different
from the one this morning.

684
01:25:11,630 --> 01:25:13,513
Not the same perfume.

685
01:25:15,848 --> 01:25:17,849
Her hands are soft.

686
01:25:20,127 --> 01:25:21,305
Elise.

687
01:25:23,956 --> 01:25:25,485
Is that Elise?

688
01:25:29,761 --> 01:25:31,999
We sh... We shoudn't.

689
01:25:34,254 --> 01:25:36,373
- I love Stefano.
- Shh.

690
01:25:38,610 --> 01:25:39,905
Don't say anything.

691
01:25:41,007 --> 01:25:42,302
You're the one I love.

692
01:25:44,299 --> 01:25:46,064
You can count on me for Mars.

693
01:25:47,512 --> 01:25:48,689
I promise.

694
01:26:26,608 --> 01:26:28,846
Do you wanna go
for a walk or something?

695
01:26:30,414 --> 01:26:32,533
I don't want anything.

696
01:26:33,499 --> 01:26:34,558
Nothing.

697
01:26:39,425 --> 01:26:42,487
- I'm so horrible.
- No, you're not.

698
01:26:42,695 --> 01:26:46,167
- You're not horrible.
- I can't stand this life anymore.

699
01:26:46,202 --> 01:26:48,780
Think about it, you've got
the most incredible kids.

700
01:26:48,815 --> 01:26:52,430
Stop trying to make me feel better.
I'm actually feeling guiltier.

701
01:26:56,234 --> 01:26:58,589
What's wrong with me?

702
01:27:01,162 --> 01:27:03,282
What is wrong with me?

703
01:27:12,454 --> 01:27:13,513
How's Mom?

704
01:27:14,484 --> 01:27:17,075
She's just a little tired.
She's sleeping.

705
01:27:17,234 --> 01:27:21,709
- She's always tired.
- Yeah, she's always tired.

706
01:27:23,070 --> 01:27:24,364
Is she depressed?

707
01:27:25,058 --> 01:27:26,707
Well, she has ups and downs.

708
01:27:27,431 --> 01:27:28,609
I don't know about you,

709
01:27:28,636 --> 01:27:30,643
but next time Mom
has one of her meltdowns,

710
01:27:30,678 --> 01:27:32,527
I'm gonna go
live somewhere else.

711
01:27:37,646 --> 01:27:41,649
So... who has a joke?

712
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:43,785
Anybody?

713
01:27:45,782 --> 01:27:46,724
I do.

714
01:27:47,492 --> 01:27:52,319
What's green, small
and goes up and down?

715
01:27:52,970 --> 01:27:54,695
A pea in an elevator.

716
01:27:54,730 --> 01:27:58,345
It's not funny.
Old people humor.

717
01:28:00,276 --> 01:28:01,453
Are you gonna be okay?

718
01:28:01,817 --> 01:28:05,585
Of course. Not 'cause Mom's
not okay that I'm not okay.

719
01:28:25,217 --> 01:28:27,101
I can't stand it anymore.

720
01:28:27,622 --> 01:28:31,153
- That noise...
- I'll ask them to keep it down.

721
01:28:32,350 --> 01:28:34,586
But it is Joyce's birthday.

722
01:28:37,859 --> 01:28:39,506
What kind of mother am I?

723
01:28:42,976 --> 01:28:43,918
I gotta get up.

724
01:29:07,688 --> 01:29:09,219
- Are you having a good time?
- Yeah.

725
01:29:09,245 --> 01:29:10,658
Can I tell you one thing?

726
01:29:10,669 --> 01:29:12,789
You're not allowed to be partying
and not have a good time.

727
01:29:12,872 --> 01:29:13,405
It doesn't work that way.

728
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:14,926
- I know...
- And you know what, Tess?

729
01:29:14,961 --> 01:29:16,457
You look beautiful.

730
01:29:16,491 --> 01:29:18,360
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful...

731
01:29:18,395 --> 01:29:20,126
But your friends aren't
dancing enough...

732
01:29:20,162 --> 01:29:22,988
And your mother has to
take care of the situation!

733
01:29:23,975 --> 01:29:25,035
Dancing!

734
01:29:27,517 --> 01:29:28,694
You, over there!

735
01:29:43,107 --> 01:29:44,873
Oh, oh!
This makes me like...

736
01:29:46,375 --> 01:29:47,553
Like a dog!

737
01:29:57,851 --> 01:30:00,794
Now let's get ready.
Take one... two... three!

738
01:30:22,928 --> 01:30:25,046
It was a nice day.

739
01:30:27,577 --> 01:30:29,814
Nicest in a long time.

740
01:30:35,258 --> 01:30:37,142
Okey-dokey.

741
01:30:37,143 --> 01:30:38,586
- Ready?
- Bye, Dad.

742
01:30:39,628 --> 01:30:41,747
Bye. Bye.

743
01:30:41,748 --> 01:30:43,034
- Have fun.
- Bye, Dad.

744
01:30:44,270 --> 01:30:45,212
Bye-bye!

745
01:32:05,792 --> 01:32:07,168
I'm leaving!

746
01:32:07,169 --> 01:32:09,311
I'm leaving! I'm leaving!

747
01:32:36,927 --> 01:32:38,072
Everything will be OK.

748
01:32:39,432 --> 01:32:40,889
That will be all right. Comon.

749
01:32:52,289 --> 01:32:53,906
Do you love me?

750
01:32:55,790 --> 01:32:58,054
I could not live without you.

751
01:36:08,220 --> 01:36:10,299
There is no life without you.

752
01:36:16,107 --> 01:36:17,638
Go slowly.

753
01:36:20,813 --> 01:36:22,697
I have to get used to it.

754
01:36:26,809 --> 01:36:32,342
I talked to you so much when you
weren't there. It's so strange for me...

755
01:36:32,643 --> 01:36:34,644
to talk to you for real.

756
01:36:52,074 --> 01:36:54,075
I need some time, Nemo.

757
01:36:56,765 --> 01:36:58,884
When we were separated at 15,

758
01:36:59,056 --> 01:37:02,111
I said I would never love
anyone else.

759
01:37:02,146 --> 01:37:02,936
Ever.

760
01:37:04,366 --> 01:37:06,250
I would never become attached.

761
01:37:06,831 --> 01:37:08,950
I'd never see
you put anywhere.

762
01:37:09,274 --> 01:37:11,393
I'd have nothing for myself.

763
01:37:14,564 --> 01:37:18,332
I decided
I would pretend to be alive.

764
01:37:23,332 --> 01:37:25,568
And this is
what I've been waiting for.

765
01:37:26,248 --> 01:37:28,249
All this time...

766
01:37:30,266 --> 01:37:35,329
Renouncing all possible lives,
for one only...

767
01:37:36,430 --> 01:37:37,489
With you.

768
01:37:47,516 --> 01:37:49,273
But I'm not used to it anymore.

769
01:37:51,024 --> 01:37:54,847
you know... love... I mean.

770
01:37:58,719 --> 01:38:00,825
I'm afraid of losing you again,

771
01:38:01,443 --> 01:38:04,076
I'm afraid of having to do without you again

772
01:38:04,502 --> 01:38:05,206
I...

773
01:38:06,056 --> 01:38:07,652
I'm terrified of that.

774
01:38:13,060 --> 01:38:14,745
We need to take some time

775
01:38:16,250 --> 01:38:18,582
And, when will I see you again?

776
01:38:26,062 --> 01:38:27,586
Call me at this number

777
01:38:31,362 --> 01:38:32,491
in two days

778
01:38:36,845 --> 01:38:38,515
I'll meet you at the lighthouse.

779
01:39:21,846 --> 01:39:24,788
You know why I lost Anna?

780
01:39:26,418 --> 01:39:28,889
because two months earlier

781
01:39:29,186 --> 01:39:32,571
An unployed Brazilian boiled an egg

782
01:39:38,336 --> 01:39:42,380
The heat created a micro-climate in the room

783
01:39:43,128 --> 01:39:45,636
slight differece of temperature.

784
01:39:48,570 --> 01:39:52,579
and heavy rain, two months later
on the other side of the world

785
01:39:54,477 --> 01:39:59,704
that Brazilian boiled an egg
instead of being at work

786
01:40:00,112 --> 01:40:02,768
He would have lost his job
in a clothing factory

787
01:40:03,113 --> 01:40:04,824
because six months earlier

788
01:40:05,195 --> 01:40:07,324
I would have compared
the prices of jeans

789
01:40:07,325 --> 01:40:09,609
and I will have bought
the cheaper pair.

790
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,864
As the Chinese proverb says

791
01:40:12,347 --> 01:40:15,085
"A single snowflake
can bend the leaf of the bamboo."

792
01:40:16,559 --> 01:40:19,931
Jeans production will have
moved to other countries.

793
01:40:28,439 --> 01:40:31,055
I lost every trace of Anna.

794
01:40:34,899 --> 01:40:36,432
I waited for her...

795
01:40:37,894 --> 01:40:39,037
every day.

796
01:42:09,963 --> 01:42:10,530
Anna.

797
01:42:15,391 --> 01:42:16,472
Nemo.

798
01:42:26,715 --> 01:42:27,715
It's back.

799
01:42:27,716 --> 01:42:29,166
The fear is back.

800
01:42:29,201 --> 01:42:31,693
I'm sick of pills!

801
01:42:31,741 --> 01:42:34,925
I'm sick of doctors. It's pointless.

802
01:42:35,611 --> 01:42:38,306
I'll do something. I can't stand it any more.

803
01:42:38,307 --> 01:42:40,079
I'm afraid.

804
01:42:40,419 --> 01:42:42,343
I don't know what to do...

805
01:42:46,656 --> 01:42:48,323
I often have this dream.

806
01:42:49,330 --> 01:42:50,960
It's a prehistoric time.

807
01:42:52,818 --> 01:42:54,265
I can hear you screaming...

808
01:43:06,429 --> 01:43:07,858
I chased the bear.

809
01:43:08,879 --> 01:43:10,872
And you're not afraid anymore.

810
01:43:11,583 --> 01:43:13,190
But when I wake up...

811
01:43:15,325 --> 01:43:16,946
When I wake up

812
01:43:17,487 --> 01:43:18,886
there's no bear

813
01:43:20,370 --> 01:43:22,378
but you're still afraid.

814
01:43:22,874 --> 01:43:24,841
I'm not a bear hunter

815
01:43:25,796 --> 01:43:29,007
I'm an executive of a plant that
manufactures photocopy machines

816
01:43:29,570 --> 01:43:31,039
who just quit his job.

817
01:43:32,764 --> 01:43:33,921
I don't dare to move.

818
01:43:35,774 --> 01:43:36,683
I don't live

819
01:43:38,449 --> 01:43:40,353
All of I do is a disaster

820
01:43:43,206 --> 01:43:45,916
I would so love to be able
to chase the bear away...

821
01:43:46,912 --> 01:43:48,934
and for you not to be afraid anymore.

822
01:43:53,008 --> 01:43:55,725
To what extent are our fears innate?

823
01:43:57,423 --> 01:43:59,590
When we hatch goose eggs
in an incubator,

824
01:44:00,092 --> 01:44:05,066
and then, above the baby birds
pass a form simulating a goose in flight

825
01:44:05,886 --> 01:44:08,304
the birds strech
their necks and call out

826
01:44:08,751 --> 01:44:10,875
But if we invert the direction
of the silhouette,

827
01:44:12,349 --> 01:44:14,128
it conjures the shape
of a falcon.

828
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:16,962
The response of the baby birds
is immediate.

829
01:44:17,532 --> 01:44:21,268
They will crouch and fear, though
they've never before seen a falcon.

830
01:44:21,585 --> 01:44:23,709
Without any instruction,

831
01:44:24,532 --> 01:44:27,557
an innate fear
helps them to survive.

832
01:44:29,127 --> 01:44:30,178
But in humans...

833
01:44:31,346 --> 01:44:33,338
to what ancient dangers...

834
01:44:34,024 --> 01:44:36,309
might our innate fears correspond?

835
01:45:15,026 --> 01:45:18,507
NEMO... TURN AROUND...

836
01:45:30,408 --> 01:45:31,408
Hey.

837
01:45:31,991 --> 01:45:32,465
Hey!

838
01:45:33,743 --> 01:45:34,676
Excuse me!

839
01:46:19,878 --> 01:46:21,362
Remember...

840
01:46:22,985 --> 01:46:24,359
Remember!

841
01:47:38,910 --> 01:47:40,126
Honey, it's me.

842
01:48:57,398 --> 01:48:59,601
Did Elise die or didn't she?

843
01:49:00,729 --> 01:49:01,776
I don't get it.

844
01:49:02,828 --> 01:49:05,146
You can't have had children
and not have had them.

845
01:49:14,944 --> 01:49:15,913
Hi, Dad.

846
01:49:18,223 --> 01:49:18,605
Hi.

847
01:49:20,083 --> 01:49:21,013
Hey.

848
01:49:22,837 --> 01:49:24,460
I'll be in a minute, guys.

849
01:49:47,970 --> 01:49:50,900
- You're not hungry?
- I don't want anything.

850
01:49:51,555 --> 01:49:52,710
Nothing.

851
01:49:56,737 --> 01:49:57,945
What are you doing today?

852
01:49:58,940 --> 01:50:02,718
I was thinking about taking
the opportunity to wash the car.

853
01:50:08,693 --> 01:50:10,113
What's the deal
with that car?

854
01:50:12,600 --> 01:50:13,707
What do you mean?

855
01:50:14,899 --> 01:50:18,379
Why do you such good care of that car
while you leave me here all alone?

856
01:50:20,902 --> 01:50:22,331
What's the problem of the car?

857
01:51:11,504 --> 01:51:13,865
There's no more problem
with the car.

858
01:51:28,337 --> 01:51:29,377
What's wrong?

859
01:51:30,100 --> 01:51:31,840
Why are you looking at me
like that?

860
01:51:32,986 --> 01:51:35,015
Why are you looking at me
like that?

861
01:51:37,258 --> 01:51:38,243
Nemo.

862
01:51:40,015 --> 01:51:42,151
Do I take sugar in my cofee?

863
01:51:44,820 --> 01:51:47,245
Can you please answer me?

864
01:51:47,673 --> 01:51:48,673
Nemo.

865
01:51:52,857 --> 01:51:56,669
You don't know me, Nemo.
You've never really looked at me.

866
01:52:03,535 --> 01:52:06,246
You've always been elsewhere.

867
01:52:07,843 --> 01:52:11,070
Do you realize how much
you've hurt me?

868
01:52:19,598 --> 01:52:24,588
I got a call from the lawer. He
just says you just put everything

869
01:52:24,589 --> 01:52:26,598
you own on my name.

870
01:52:27,761 --> 01:52:29,453
Why, Nemo?

871
01:52:30,848 --> 01:52:32,774
What you're up to?

872
01:52:50,937 --> 01:52:53,065
Are you angling for success?

873
01:52:53,066 --> 01:52:54,933
Then you need a
butterfly fishing rod.

874
01:52:54,968 --> 01:52:57,951
For tension and strength is ....

875
01:52:57,952 --> 01:53:01,063
Buy one today, available now.

876
01:53:08,162 --> 01:53:09,162
Jean.

877
01:53:10,166 --> 01:53:12,230
A'm after buy a fishing rod.

878
01:54:00,111 --> 01:54:01,438
Mr. Jones.

879
01:54:03,373 --> 01:54:05,766
- Yes.
- We already have your luggage.

880
01:54:05,801 --> 01:54:07,695
Please, follow me.

881
01:54:07,730 --> 01:54:10,327
I'll take you to the hotel
where you can rest for a while.

882
01:54:10,362 --> 01:54:12,422
The appointment is at 3 PM.

883
01:54:38,997 --> 01:54:40,363
Daniel.

884
01:54:41,177 --> 01:54:43,024
Daniel Jones.

885
01:54:43,059 --> 01:54:45,445
Daniel Jones.

886
01:54:46,850 --> 01:54:50,266
Is your name Daniel Jones?

887
01:54:52,110 --> 01:54:54,660
Of course not!

888
01:54:59,680 --> 01:55:01,977
Daniel Jones...

889
01:55:05,318 --> 01:55:06,318
Hallo?

890
01:55:07,163 --> 01:55:08,163
Daniel?

891
01:55:09,099 --> 01:55:10,099
Yes.

892
01:55:10,437 --> 01:55:12,468
Are you insane?

893
01:55:12,469 --> 01:55:15,125
I told you not to go. They are furious!

894
01:55:15,126 --> 01:55:17,532
They know it's you. Don't stay there!

895
01:55:51,037 --> 01:55:52,772
This is weird.

896
01:55:53,360 --> 01:55:55,596
His shoes are different sizes.

897
01:56:06,953 --> 01:56:08,304
Maybe he shrunk.

898
01:56:08,339 --> 01:56:10,801
Times when you get older,
you shrink.

899
01:56:10,836 --> 01:56:12,494
No one shrinks,
that's rubbish.

900
01:56:12,901 --> 01:56:14,571
You got the wrong plug, that's all.

901
01:56:15,473 --> 01:56:18,175
Astronauts shrink two inches
when they come back to Earth.

902
01:56:18,733 --> 01:56:22,034
- Because of gravity or something.
- You think this fellow is an astronaut?

903
01:56:52,541 --> 01:56:55,302
The ground doesn't vibrate
in the same way.

904
01:56:57,849 --> 01:56:59,344
It's a different perfume.

905
01:57:01,343 --> 01:57:03,399
How old might she be?

906
01:57:03,891 --> 01:57:05,324
Twenty five?

907
01:57:07,727 --> 01:57:10,600
There are other people too.

908
01:57:19,527 --> 01:57:22,007
Let's begin again.

909
01:57:22,533 --> 01:57:24,230
Fingers on the keyboard.

910
01:57:26,194 --> 01:57:29,379
Left hand: A, S, D, F.

911
01:57:31,047 --> 01:57:34,124
Right hand: H, J, K, L.

912
01:58:51,223 --> 01:58:54,693
- What's wrong?
- I was dreaming about Stefano.

913
01:58:58,042 --> 01:58:59,853
He doesn't give a damn
about me.

914
01:59:01,611 --> 01:59:02,611
Stefano?

915
01:59:09,359 --> 01:59:10,409
I love him.

916
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:15,391
I can't see any other explanation
for being in this state.

917
01:59:18,116 --> 01:59:19,581
That's the only thing
it can be.

918
01:59:21,650 --> 01:59:22,718
I love him.

919
01:59:25,496 --> 01:59:26,774
I know I'm crazy.

920
01:59:29,444 --> 01:59:32,393
Every morning when I wake up,
I open my eyes and I see your face

921
01:59:32,784 --> 01:59:34,385
and I start crying.

922
01:59:37,612 --> 01:59:41,150
I realize that with you,
my life is passing me by.

923
01:59:45,449 --> 01:59:48,498
How can you stay so calm?

924
01:59:48,498 --> 01:59:51,210
How can you bear that?

925
01:59:51,211 --> 01:59:53,091
You're not human.

926
01:59:53,092 --> 01:59:54,669
I don't know what to do.

927
01:59:56,444 --> 01:59:58,276
It's not my fault, right?

928
01:59:58,665 --> 02:00:00,629
You're not gonna leave me,
are you?

929
02:00:01,230 --> 02:00:03,167
No, I couldn't live without you.

930
02:00:06,074 --> 02:00:07,570
I've hurt everybody.

931
02:00:08,782 --> 02:00:10,329
I've hurt you.

932
02:00:11,610 --> 02:00:13,150
The children...

933
02:00:14,607 --> 02:00:17,618
- I just can't go on.
- Together we can do it.

934
02:00:17,991 --> 02:00:20,700
If I stay here, you're all gonna
end up drowning with me.

935
02:00:22,100 --> 02:00:23,541
We'll learn to swim.

936
02:00:24,689 --> 02:00:25,752
I love you.

937
02:00:27,772 --> 02:00:28,880
I love you.

938
02:00:31,752 --> 02:00:33,300
I love you.

939
02:00:53,582 --> 02:00:54,781
She left me.

940
02:00:59,853 --> 02:01:02,280
You know what they say...

941
02:01:03,489 --> 02:01:06,175
Everything works out
in the end,

942
02:01:08,132 --> 02:01:09,316
even badly.

943
02:01:38,709 --> 02:01:39,328
Hello?

944
02:01:50,490 --> 02:01:52,894
Not too much
at the top, thanks.

945
02:02:06,149 --> 02:02:08,316
- How much should that be?
- $20, please.

946
02:02:09,663 --> 02:02:11,140
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

947
02:02:24,187 --> 02:02:26,998
- $20 please, sir.
- Here you are.

948
02:02:27,255 --> 02:02:28,485
Thank you. Bye, sir.

949
02:02:28,819 --> 02:02:31,554
Bye, and have
a nice afternoon.

950
02:02:55,983 --> 02:02:59,281
Why does cigarette smoke
never go back into the cigarette?

951
02:03:00,018 --> 02:03:02,318
Why do molecules spread
away from each other?

952
02:03:02,878 --> 02:03:05,226
Why does a spilled drop
of ink never reform?

953
02:03:05,992 --> 02:03:10,051
Because the Universe
moves towards a state of dissipation.

954
02:03:10,636 --> 02:03:12,331
That is the principle of entropy...

955
02:03:12,626 --> 02:03:14,220
The tendency of the Universe

956
02:03:14,703 --> 02:03:17,759
to evolve toward a state
of increasing disorder.

957
02:03:18,398 --> 02:03:19,746
The principle of entropy

958
02:03:19,885 --> 02:03:22,569
is related
to the arrow of time...

959
02:03:23,110 --> 02:03:25,475
A result of the expansion
of the Universe.

960
02:03:25,749 --> 02:03:27,823
But what will happen
when gravitational forces

961
02:03:27,930 --> 02:03:30,438
counter-balance
the forces of expansion?

962
02:03:31,168 --> 02:03:33,766
Or if the energy of the quantum void
proves too weak?

963
02:03:34,525 --> 02:03:38,147
At that moment, the universe
might enter its phase of contraction.

964
02:03:38,798 --> 02:03:40,024
The Big Crunch.

965
02:03:44,295 --> 02:03:45,793
So what will become of time?

966
02:03:49,750 --> 02:03:50,885
Will it reverse?

967
02:03:58,049 --> 02:03:59,761
No one knows the answer.

968
02:04:05,080 --> 02:04:06,080
Where is Peter?

969
02:04:06,081 --> 02:04:10,424
He left an hour ago. I'm replacing
him. I've selected take 3 and take 4.

970
02:04:10,872 --> 02:04:14,072
I prefer that Peter does it. I don't mean
to say you're not good enough.

971
02:04:14,073 --> 02:04:15,073
But...

972
02:04:15,699 --> 02:04:18,122
Drop it. In live you get one take.

973
02:04:18,123 --> 02:04:20,654
If it's bad, you just deal with it.

974
02:04:49,610 --> 02:04:51,177
You know him?

975
02:04:52,110 --> 02:04:54,148
We work together.

976
02:04:55,656 --> 02:04:59,131
If I should die, and you shoul live,

977
02:05:32,026 --> 02:05:33,557
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

978
02:05:33,558 --> 02:05:35,830
My sincerest condolences.

979
02:05:35,986 --> 02:05:37,927
Peter was a colleague.

980
02:05:38,338 --> 02:05:39,387
Of course.

981
02:05:39,422 --> 02:05:42,361
I've seen your show.
Thank you for coming.

982
02:06:15,596 --> 02:06:17,530
<i>Please take
this oportunity to take</i>

983
02:06:17,695 --> 02:06:20,315
<i>one last close look
at the planet's surface.</i>

984
02:06:20,818 --> 02:06:23,001
<i>from our observation dome.</i>

985
02:06:23,237 --> 02:06:27,720
<i>Your elevator will arrive shortly
in the Mars transit station.</i>

986
02:06:33,977 --> 02:06:36,376
What are we doing
with all those bikes?

987
02:06:37,354 --> 02:06:40,158
They're for export.
Labor is much cheaper here.

988
02:06:40,604 --> 02:06:43,118
China has become
way too expensive.

989
02:06:45,087 --> 02:06:47,470
<i>Please proceed
to the preparation area</i>

990
02:06:48,203 --> 02:06:51,501
<i>where you will be reissued
to your sleep suits.</i>

991
02:06:51,966 --> 02:06:55,269
<i>You will also receive your...</i>

992
02:06:55,747 --> 02:06:56,405
Hi.

993
02:06:57,639 --> 02:06:58,656
I'm Nemo.

994
02:06:59,754 --> 02:07:00,472
Anna...

995
02:07:01,548 --> 02:07:02,716
Nice to meet you.

996
02:07:07,551 --> 02:07:08,895
What brings you to Mars?

997
02:07:09,828 --> 02:07:14,326
I'm measuring the distance between
Mars and Earth at it's greatest.

998
02:07:14,901 --> 02:07:17,121
I study time. You know...

999
02:07:17,675 --> 02:07:21,056
Thing that makes it so that
everything doesn't happen at once.

1000
02:07:24,734 --> 02:07:25,490
And?

1001
02:07:25,659 --> 02:07:27,959
The Big Crunch
will happen in 2092

1002
02:07:28,230 --> 02:07:32,888
and people who can't hang
on that long will get a free run.

1003
02:07:34,240 --> 02:07:35,197
And you?

1004
02:07:35,747 --> 02:07:37,709
I'm just
keeping an old promise.

1005
02:07:43,626 --> 02:07:44,626
Hi.

1006
02:07:45,395 --> 02:07:46,395
Hi.

1007
02:07:47,889 --> 02:07:50,689
We ah... met at your husband's funeral.

1008
02:07:51,572 --> 02:07:52,572
Right.

1009
02:07:53,192 --> 02:07:55,941
I had the strangest feeling when
I saw you that we have met before.

1010
02:07:57,076 --> 02:07:59,227
It's called de javu.

1011
02:07:59,228 --> 02:08:00,795
That's not it.

1012
02:08:01,641 --> 02:08:03,392
It's as if...

1013
02:08:03,393 --> 02:08:05,647
all of this was in real.

1014
02:08:07,435 --> 02:08:11,315
I'm sorry you must think
that I'm completely crazy.

1015
02:08:12,384 --> 02:08:14,984
I'm not trying to flirt with you.

1016
02:08:14,985 --> 02:08:16,608
I am widower myself.

1017
02:08:16,609 --> 02:08:19,008
I... I'm sorry. I have to go.

1018
02:08:19,009 --> 02:08:20,756
May be some other time.

1019
02:08:26,259 --> 02:08:27,259
Nemo?

1020
02:08:28,603 --> 02:08:31,563
I heard you were dead.
That you drowned.

1021
02:08:31,564 --> 02:08:33,001
Drowned?

1022
02:09:46,159 --> 02:09:49,332
<i>Alert! Alert!
Meteors approaching.</i>

1023
02:09:50,371 --> 02:09:51,375
<i>Don't panic.</i>

1024
02:09:53,062 --> 02:09:55,017
<i>Alert! Alert!</i>

1025
02:10:13,581 --> 02:10:14,848
I wanna wake up.

1026
02:10:16,737 --> 02:10:18,158
I wanna wake up!

1027
02:10:18,797 --> 02:10:20,427
I wanna wake up!

1028
02:10:21,998 --> 02:10:24,857
GAME OVER.

1029
02:10:24,892 --> 02:10:26,209
Are you alright?

1030
02:10:28,245 --> 02:10:29,550
Are you alright?

1031
02:10:31,249 --> 02:10:34,135
When I say three,
you'll be awake.

1032
02:10:35,235 --> 02:10:36,247
One...

1033
02:10:41,360 --> 02:10:42,366
Two...

1034
02:10:48,579 --> 02:10:49,249
Three.

1035
02:11:03,232 --> 02:11:05,413
WAKE UP.......

1036
02:11:36,278 --> 02:11:38,429
- Mother.
- Do I know you?

1037
02:11:39,416 --> 02:11:41,196
- It's me!
- What do you want?

1038
02:11:41,459 --> 02:11:43,229
- Henry!
- It's me.  Your son, Nemo.

1039
02:11:44,318 --> 02:11:45,922
My son's just here.

1040
02:11:47,953 --> 02:11:51,685
I don't know you. You're mad.
Now go away or I'll call the police.

1041
02:11:52,804 --> 02:11:53,255
Mother.

1042
02:11:53,679 --> 02:11:54,711
Mother.

1043
02:12:11,363 --> 02:12:12,986
What do you see?

1044
02:12:12,987 --> 02:12:15,136
He askes me what I see.

1045
02:12:19,468 --> 02:12:21,779
I say, it's an ink stain.

1046
02:12:22,711 --> 02:12:23,698
He says:

1047
02:12:23,699 --> 02:12:25,867
You have to say more.

1048
02:12:26,037 --> 02:12:29,176
I say, it's an ink stain on a sheet of paper.

1049
02:12:30,550 --> 02:12:31,550
No.

1050
02:12:32,514 --> 02:12:36,305
You have to say, what
goes through your mind.

1051
02:12:40,837 --> 02:12:43,084
It makes me think of an inkwell.

1052
02:12:43,135 --> 02:12:45,688
So he says: "O'key...

1053
02:12:46,767 --> 02:12:48,387
That's fine".

1054
02:13:00,760 --> 02:13:02,484
.evaeL .omeN

1055
02:13:02,666 --> 02:13:05,417
You have until tomorrow to vote.

1056
02:13:05,891 --> 02:13:06,891
Vote!

1057
02:13:06,892 --> 02:13:08,945
And win a vacation on the Moon.

1058
02:13:08,946 --> 02:13:10,364
For the whole family.

1059
02:13:11,168 --> 02:13:13,096
Win a trip to the Moon!

1060
02:13:13,580 --> 02:13:16,356
Take a swing at a fabulous golf vacation.

1061
02:13:29,398 --> 02:13:32,328
Have they announced
the results of the voting?

1062
02:13:33,357 --> 02:13:34,774
I'm sorry.

1063
02:13:34,775 --> 02:13:37,492
At my age.

1064
02:13:37,493 --> 02:13:41,280
The candles cost more than a cake.

1065
02:13:45,387 --> 02:13:47,838
I'm not afraid of dying.

1066
02:13:48,142 --> 02:13:51,201
I'm afraid I have'nt been alive enough!

1067
02:13:54,603 --> 02:13:58,845
It should be written on every
schoolroom blackboard.

1068
02:14:00,632 --> 02:14:03,375
Life is a playground.

1069
02:14:04,942 --> 02:14:06,862
Or nothing.

02:14:13,380 --> 02:14:14,104
Nemo. Leave.

1072
02:14:14,105 --> 02:14:15,741
NOW

1073
02:14:18,212 --> 02:14:21,424
Nemo. Leave. NOW

1074
02:14:28,492 --> 02:14:29,492
Nemo!

1075
02:14:46,438 --> 02:14:50,030
NEMO, READ THE NEWS.

1076
02:15:00,778 --> 02:15:02,518
Tragic car accident
on a country road

1077
02:15:04,387 --> 02:15:06,527
Nemo turn to page 5

1078
02:15:07,350 --> 02:15:09,716
Nemo look at the
end of the street

1079
02:15:12,650 --> 02:15:15,872
NEMO CALL
123 581 1321

1080
02:15:24,517 --> 02:15:27,460
<i>- Hello, who is this?
- Hello, who is this?</i>

1081
02:15:28,159 --> 02:15:29,337
<i>Who is this?</i>

1082
02:15:30,434 --> 02:15:31,900
I was told to call this number.

1083
02:15:32,403 --> 02:15:34,185
My name is Nemo Nobody.

1084
02:15:36,167 --> 02:15:37,719
Is this some kind
of a joke?

1085
02:15:38,284 --> 02:15:40,116
No. No, I...

1086
02:15:44,974 --> 02:15:46,238
<i>- Operator?
- Yes?</i>

1087
02:15:46,336 --> 02:15:50,231
I'd like the address to
123 581 1321.

1088
02:15:51,228 --> 02:15:52,470
<i>One moment please.</i>

1089
02:15:54,243 --> 02:15:56,443
<i>12358 Alleway Street.</i>

1090
02:16:24,862 --> 02:16:26,535
<i>Hello, Nemo.</i>

1091
02:16:27,082 --> 02:16:29,133
<i>I'm glad you found me.</i>

1092
02:16:29,791 --> 02:16:32,748
<i>All of this must seem
very complicated to you,</i>

1093
02:16:32,803 --> 02:16:35,296
<i>but it's simpler than you think.</i>

1094
02:16:35,869 --> 02:16:38,203
<i>Careful with the chair.
It is damaged.</i>

1095
02:16:44,876 --> 02:16:48,093
<i>- Are you alright?
- I'm fine.</i>

1096
02:16:50,247 --> 02:16:52,323
<i>I should have
warned you earlier but...</i>

1097
02:16:52,562 --> 02:16:55,172
<i>I couldn't
because of the transcript.</i>

1098
02:16:55,397 --> 02:16:56,396
The transcript?

1099
02:16:57,012 --> 02:17:00,244
<i>The text of our conversation!</i>

1100
02:17:02,569 --> 02:17:05,467
<i>- You can you hear me!
- What you are living now...</i>

1101
02:17:06,324 --> 02:17:07,801
<i>is the past.</i>

1102
02:17:08,927 --> 02:17:10,684
<i>At least, for me.</i>

1103
02:17:12,641 --> 02:17:14,044
<i>I am you...</i>

1104
02:17:15,005 --> 02:17:17,530
<i>70 years older.</i>

1105
02:17:19,201 --> 02:17:23,293
<i>Everything you say, I said
myself when I was young.</i>

1106
02:17:23,506 --> 02:17:27,158
<i>I only had to transcribe
our conversation.</i>

1107
02:17:27,905 --> 02:17:30,212
<i>It's all written right here.</i>

1108
02:17:30,271 --> 02:17:31,778
<i>- I can't...
- Believe it?</i>

1109
02:17:34,046 --> 02:17:35,429
<i>For me...</i>

1110
02:17:36,270 --> 02:17:38,475
<i>...time is inverted.</i>

1111
02:17:39,191 --> 02:17:41,751
<i>I start at the end of the story</i>

1112
02:17:41,752 --> 02:17:43,727
<i>and go toward the beginning.</i>

1113
02:17:44,633 --> 02:17:46,231
I don't understand.

1114
02:17:46,266 --> 02:17:47,866
<i>In this life here,</i>

1115
02:17:48,600 --> 02:17:50,756
you don't exist.

1116
02:17:50,756 --> 02:17:52,572
<i>I don't know why...</i>

1117
02:17:52,991 --> 02:17:55,217
<i>Only the Architect knows.</i>

1118
02:17:56,855 --> 02:17:57,847
The Architect?

1119
02:17:59,002 --> 02:18:00,349
<i>The child...</i>

1120
02:18:01,373 --> 02:18:04,137
<i>The one running
after the train.</i>

1121
02:18:05,874 --> 02:18:08,594
<i>Maybe your parents
never met.</i>

1122
02:18:12,862 --> 02:18:17,714
<i>Maybe your father died
in a sledging accident.</i>

1123
02:18:19,424 --> 02:18:21,698
<i>Maybe you were one
of the vast majority</i>

1124
02:18:21,756 --> 02:18:26,481
<i>of those whose genetic code did not
reach its final destination.</i>

1125
02:18:29,895 --> 02:18:31,451
<i>Maybe when she died...</i>

1126
02:18:32,404 --> 02:18:34,081
<i>A prehistoric woman...</i>

1127
02:18:34,329 --> 02:18:38,321
<i>She rolled off the line of heritance
to which you belong.</i>

1128
02:18:39,686 --> 02:18:41,219
<i>So for this world...</i>

1129
02:18:44,212 --> 02:18:46,480
<i>You don't exist.</i>

1130
02:18:47,980 --> 02:18:50,933
<i>If the Anna's calculations are correct,</i>

1131
02:18:51,646 --> 02:18:58,255
<i>you need to stay alive
untill 2092, February 12.</i>

1132
02:18:59,168 --> 02:19:02,001
<i>5:50 AM.</i>

1133
02:19:34,522 --> 02:19:36,473
I'm sorry, I don't know how long
we haven't been recording.

1134
02:19:37,072 --> 02:19:39,462
I have to submit my story
by tomorrow morning.

1135
02:19:41,902 --> 02:19:44,172
Everything that you say
is contradictory.

1136
02:19:45,683 --> 02:19:49,245
You can't have been in one place
and another at the same time.

1137
02:19:50,094 --> 02:19:54,284
You mean to say
we have to make choices?

1138
02:19:54,761 --> 02:19:56,328
Of all those lives,
which one...

1139
02:19:57,781 --> 02:19:59,157
Which one is the right one?

1140
02:20:00,114 --> 02:20:03,801
Each of these lives
is the right one.

1141
02:20:05,424 --> 02:20:10,109
Every path
is the right path.

1142
02:20:13,675 --> 02:20:17,974
"Everything could have been
anything else...

1143
02:20:19,407 --> 02:20:23,944
and it would have just
as much meaning."

1144
02:20:26,129 --> 02:20:28,522
Tennessee Williams.

1145
02:20:30,273 --> 02:20:32,529
You're too young for that.

1146
02:20:32,892 --> 02:20:34,529
You can't be dead
and still be here.

1147
02:20:36,169 --> 02:20:37,272
You can't not exist.

1148
02:20:43,950 --> 02:20:45,480
Is there life after death?

1149
02:20:48,993 --> 02:20:50,409
After death...

1150
02:20:53,990 --> 02:20:59,959
How can you be so sure
you even exist?

1151
02:21:10,108 --> 02:21:12,813
You don't exist.

1152
02:21:14,346 --> 02:21:15,949
Neither do I.

1153
02:21:19,119 --> 02:21:25,394
We only live in the imagination
of a nine year old child.

1154
02:21:26,210 --> 02:21:30,448
We are imagined
by a nine year old child,

1155
02:21:31,373 --> 02:21:34,307
faced with
an impossible choice.

1156
02:21:44,042 --> 02:21:45,407
Run! Run!

1157
02:21:51,663 --> 02:21:52,866
Nemo!

1158
02:21:58,487 --> 02:21:59,927
Run!

1159
02:22:04,836 --> 02:22:05,939
Run, Nemo!

1160
02:22:08,902 --> 02:22:10,210
Nemo!

1161
02:22:19,034 --> 02:22:20,179
I love you.

1162
02:22:21,015 --> 02:22:22,015
Anna!

1163
02:22:35,164 --> 02:22:36,164
Nemo!

1164
02:22:45,779 --> 02:22:47,347
You're the one I love.

1165
02:23:03,296 --> 02:23:04,458
In chess,

1166
02:23:06,847 --> 02:23:09,563
it's called Zugzwang,

1167
02:23:11,131 --> 02:23:13,526
when the only viable move

1168
02:23:19,022 --> 02:23:21,056
is not to move.

1169
02:23:30,939 --> 02:23:32,479
Come see.

1170
02:23:56,209 --> 02:23:57,027
It's the sea.

1171
02:23:58,044 --> 02:24:01,011
The child is taking it apart.

1172
02:24:02,376 --> 02:24:04,632
He doesn't need it anymore.

1173
02:24:05,851 --> 02:24:09,626
Before, he was unable
to make a choice

1174
02:24:10,542 --> 02:24:12,983
'cause he didn't know
what would happen.

1175
02:24:13,781 --> 02:24:16,606
Now that he knows
what will happen,

1176
02:24:18,754 --> 02:24:21,355
he is unable
to make a choice.

1177
02:25:27,023 --> 02:25:28,663
Thank you, thank you!

1178
02:25:29,115 --> 02:25:29,926
Thank you.

1179
02:26:06,410 --> 02:26:12,019
This is the most beautiful day
of my life.

1180
02:26:21,244 --> 02:26:21,773
Anna.

1181
02:26:25,904 --> 02:26:26,860
Anna.
