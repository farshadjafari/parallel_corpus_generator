3
00:03:40,747 --> 00:03:42,666
Swann.

4
00:03:49,006 --> 00:03:53,776
And the fire said to me...
said to me...

5
00:03:56,597 --> 00:03:58,515
"Nix, Nix,

6
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:00,934
you are my instrument.

7
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:04,730
From now on you shall be known...

8
00:04:04,813 --> 00:04:06,273
as...

9
00:04:08,233 --> 00:04:10,027
the Puritan.

10
00:04:11,028 --> 00:04:14,031
You will find a few good men...

11
00:04:14,114 --> 00:04:15,616
and women...

12
00:04:17,743 --> 00:04:20,162
and together...

13
00:04:21,705 --> 00:04:23,624
together...

14
00:04:25,792 --> 00:04:28,253
you will cleanse the world."

15
00:04:31,298 --> 00:04:33,091
Master.

16
00:04:36,136 --> 00:04:38,055
Swann's here.

17
00:04:52,903 --> 00:04:54,821
Are we ready?

18
00:04:56,657 --> 00:04:59,451
- Ready.
- Maybe we should think about this.

19
00:04:59,535 --> 00:05:02,120
He's gone too far.

20
00:05:02,162 --> 00:05:03,789
So he took a kid.

21
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,415
He's gonna kill her.

22
00:05:05,499 --> 00:05:07,793
He could drive us crazy.

23
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:09,962
So stay out here!

24
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:17,636
Please get away from me.

25
00:05:23,267 --> 00:05:24,309
Hush!

26
00:05:24,393 --> 00:05:27,354
Please don't hurt me!

27
00:05:29,481 --> 00:05:32,150
I said, hush.

28
00:05:39,116 --> 00:05:40,325
What is it?

29
00:05:47,207 --> 00:05:49,710
What's the matter, huh?

30
00:05:51,211 --> 00:05:52,462
Please! Please!

31
00:05:54,715 --> 00:05:57,175
What are you gonna do to me?

32
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,807
Leave me alone!

33
00:06:05,726 --> 00:06:07,853
Want me to shoot, Swann?

34
00:06:08,437 --> 00:06:09,813
Leave me alone!

35
00:06:09,897 --> 00:06:12,149
You don't like him, do you?

36
00:06:13,567 --> 00:06:16,695
- He wants her magic.
- Maybe.

37
00:06:16,737 --> 00:06:18,864
Go! Fetch him.

38
00:06:23,327 --> 00:06:25,746
I think he's in love.

39
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,169
If you see the kid, yell.

40
00:06:37,966 --> 00:06:39,676
- Quaid.
- Hey, man.

41
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:42,262
It's Quaid.

42
00:06:45,724 --> 00:06:48,060
I thought you weren't coming back.

43
00:06:48,936 --> 00:06:50,854
I changed my mind.

44
00:06:53,774 --> 00:06:56,109
You can't leave, man.

45
00:06:56,193 --> 00:06:58,111
He won't let you.

46
00:07:25,097 --> 00:07:27,015
You're gonna be okay.

47
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:28,433
Okay?

48
00:07:43,448 --> 00:07:45,158
I knew you'd come.

49
00:07:46,326 --> 00:07:49,288
I've got so much power
to give you, Swann.

50
00:07:50,414 --> 00:07:52,332
All you have to do...

51
00:07:53,417 --> 00:07:54,668
is beg.

52
00:07:56,545 --> 00:07:57,796
Fuck you.

53
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,341
You don't think that
I've got it to give?

54
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,678
You're wrong!

55
00:08:08,056 --> 00:08:11,643
I could eat your fucking soul!

56
00:08:21,153 --> 00:08:23,530
Now be a good girl.

57
00:08:26,408 --> 00:08:27,534
Fuck!

58
00:08:27,618 --> 00:08:29,828
Stay here.

59
00:08:29,912 --> 00:08:32,623
- Jennifer, are you okay?
- Jesus!

60
00:08:35,209 --> 00:08:37,461
Stay away.

61
00:08:37,544 --> 00:08:39,463
Stay the fuck away.

62
00:08:49,056 --> 00:08:50,682
Are you okay?

63
00:08:52,226 --> 00:08:54,186
How would you like...

64
00:08:55,229 --> 00:08:56,647
to see the world...

65
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,024
the way it really is?

66
00:08:59,066 --> 00:09:02,236
You wanna see flesh...
with a god's eyes?

67
00:09:32,808 --> 00:09:34,268
Swann?

68
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,770
Here he is.

69
00:09:39,773 --> 00:09:41,858
Take a look, Swann.

70
00:09:44,861 --> 00:09:47,072
These are your friends.

71
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:11,388
What have you done to him?

72
00:10:12,764 --> 00:10:14,975
- Swann...
- Don't touch me!

73
00:10:15,058 --> 00:10:17,311
He got into my head!

74
00:10:19,146 --> 00:10:21,231
You wanna be like that, Swann?

75
00:10:22,983 --> 00:10:25,944
Mud? Shit?

76
00:10:27,654 --> 00:10:30,199
Come here.

77
00:10:32,534 --> 00:10:35,287
Share the power.

78
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,320
Swann.

79
00:11:09,071 --> 00:11:10,405
Help me.

80
00:11:20,082 --> 00:11:21,667
Bag.

81
00:11:28,674 --> 00:11:30,592
Help me.

82
00:11:30,676 --> 00:11:33,512
- What are you doing?
- Binding you.

83
00:11:33,595 --> 00:11:35,722
You piece of shit!

84
00:11:47,109 --> 00:11:49,903
This isn't over, Swann.

85
00:11:54,074 --> 00:11:55,117
This isn't finished.

86
00:12:41,366 --> 00:12:42,826
Dead?

87
00:12:46,538 --> 00:12:47,956
Dead.

88
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,460
What now?

89
00:12:52,836 --> 00:12:55,088
We bury him so deep...

90
00:12:56,423 --> 00:12:58,884
no one will ever find him.

91
00:14:23,552 --> 00:14:26,471
I been calling you for
three days, Harry.

92
00:14:26,555 --> 00:14:28,473
I missed you too, Loomis.

93
00:14:29,641 --> 00:14:31,602
You got a beer?

94
00:14:40,319 --> 00:14:42,362
I got a job for you...

95
00:14:42,446 --> 00:14:45,449
if you can tear yourself away
from all this weird shit.

96
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,201
You need a woman's touch in here.

97
00:14:48,285 --> 00:14:51,079
Why don't you get
yourself a secretary?

98
00:14:51,163 --> 00:14:52,831
On what you pay me?

99
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,459
So get married.

100
00:14:57,628 --> 00:14:59,296
Tried that.

101
00:14:59,338 --> 00:15:00,797
Oh, yeah.

102
00:15:01,765 --> 00:15:04,977
"Harry D'Amour, who describes
himself as a private detective...

103
00:15:05,018 --> 00:15:08,230
has been linked with occult
activities on several occasions.

104
00:15:08,313 --> 00:15:12,484
'We regard D'Amour as a
highly dubious character...'

105
00:15:12,568 --> 00:15:13,861
quoted one source."

106
00:15:14,945 --> 00:15:16,363
That's nice, Harry.

107
00:15:17,948 --> 00:15:19,616
It's all bullshit.

108
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,370
It was on TV last night.

109
00:15:23,454 --> 00:15:26,165
You looked like shit, by the way.

110
00:15:26,248 --> 00:15:28,125
- Thanks.
- What's the story?

111
00:15:28,167 --> 00:15:30,127
Was the kid really possessed?

112
00:15:33,672 --> 00:15:35,090
Probably.

113
00:15:38,886 --> 00:15:40,429
By what?

114
00:15:41,555 --> 00:15:43,849
You know.

115
00:15:43,932 --> 00:15:45,350
The usual.

116
00:15:46,518 --> 00:15:48,812
You need a vacation.

117
00:15:49,646 --> 00:15:52,191
Somewhere sunny, like...

118
00:15:52,274 --> 00:15:53,609
L.A.

119
00:15:53,692 --> 00:15:55,944
That's where the job is?

120
00:15:57,071 --> 00:15:59,990
Guy's name's Tapert.
Big insurance fraud.

121
00:16:00,032 --> 00:16:03,035
He's gone west to spend
his ill-gotten gains.

122
00:16:04,161 --> 00:16:05,662
It's worth ten grand...

123
00:16:05,704 --> 00:16:07,664
if you catch him doing it.

124
00:16:07,706 --> 00:16:08,832
If I don't?

125
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,210
Catch a tan.

126
00:16:13,212 --> 00:16:15,672
I need someone of your
caliber on this, Harry.

127
00:16:22,888 --> 00:16:25,182
Taste the darkness, D'Amour.

128
00:16:25,224 --> 00:16:26,975
It's been waiting for you.

129
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:35,275
Yeah, well, maybe I
do need a vacation.

130
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:36,610
You'll like L.A.

131
00:16:36,694 --> 00:16:39,780
There's great weather, great women.

132
00:17:03,512 --> 00:17:05,556
- Here you go.
- Thanks. Have a nice evening.

133
00:17:05,639 --> 00:17:07,099
You bet.

134
00:17:11,729 --> 00:17:13,272
Hello, L.A.

135
00:17:25,951 --> 00:17:27,494
9:18 p.m.

136
00:17:29,538 --> 00:17:31,874
Tapert's paying by the hour.

137
00:17:31,957 --> 00:17:33,917
He's getting his money's worth.

138
00:17:45,804 --> 00:17:48,932
Come here, you fuckers! Come on in!

139
00:17:56,148 --> 00:17:57,441
Wait a minute.

140
00:17:57,483 --> 00:17:59,443
He's late for something.

141
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,219
What the hell?

142
00:20:41,397 --> 00:20:43,315
Ever watched a man die?

143
00:20:45,484 --> 00:20:47,486
If you watch very closely...

144
00:20:47,569 --> 00:20:51,031
you can sometimes see
the soul escaping.

145
00:20:54,451 --> 00:20:57,204
And if you're very quick...

146
00:20:57,287 --> 00:20:58,831
you can catch it.

147
00:21:02,334 --> 00:21:04,211
I wasn't there.

148
00:21:07,548 --> 00:21:09,466
Ask Pimm.

149
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,968
Pimm's dead.

150
00:21:13,262 --> 00:21:15,723
Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared.

151
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:21,395
They knew the Puritan
was coming home.

152
00:21:21,478 --> 00:21:23,230
So did you.

153
00:21:52,051 --> 00:21:53,469
Wait.

154
00:21:53,552 --> 00:21:54,970
Don't leave me.

155
00:22:05,856 --> 00:22:07,983
Did you come for a reading?

156
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:15,574
My God.

157
00:22:15,657 --> 00:22:17,451
What?

158
00:22:17,493 --> 00:22:20,746
You are drawn to the dark side...

159
00:22:22,331 --> 00:22:24,291
over and over.

160
00:22:25,084 --> 00:22:26,668
You don't like that.

161
00:22:26,752 --> 00:22:28,170
Not much.

162
00:22:29,838 --> 00:22:32,549
You can't change it.

163
00:22:32,633 --> 00:22:35,344
You must walk the line...

164
00:22:35,427 --> 00:22:37,346
between heaven and hell.

165
00:22:39,348 --> 00:22:41,308
It is your destiny.

166
00:22:42,393 --> 00:22:43,852
Accept it.

167
00:22:47,189 --> 00:22:49,149
Hang on.

168
00:22:50,025 --> 00:22:51,944
I'm not afraid to die.

169
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:59,410
There's something terrible...

170
00:22:59,493 --> 00:23:02,329
coming home soon.

171
00:23:03,372 --> 00:23:04,415
The Puritan?

172
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,295
Who is he?

173
00:23:16,385 --> 00:23:17,803
Shit.

174
00:23:37,906 --> 00:23:39,867
What were you doing up here?

175
00:23:39,908 --> 00:23:41,368
I'm a private detective.

176
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:45,372
I was hired to follow a guy named
Tapert for a couple of days.

177
00:23:45,414 --> 00:23:48,125
- Insurance fraud.
- Tapert.

178
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:51,003
So now I've got Tapert,
Butterfield...

179
00:23:51,086 --> 00:23:53,505
Tapert's got nothin'
to do with this.

180
00:23:53,589 --> 00:23:56,008
He just came to get his palm read.

181
00:23:58,761 --> 00:24:00,721
This is something else.

182
00:24:02,473 --> 00:24:04,933
You ever heard of somebody
called the Puritan?

183
00:24:04,975 --> 00:24:06,935
New one on me. Let's see him.

184
00:24:09,271 --> 00:24:10,689
Where the fuck is he?

185
00:24:10,773 --> 00:24:12,608
He got up and walked.

186
00:24:13,901 --> 00:24:16,820
After that fall, he would've
broken half his bones.

187
00:24:18,614 --> 00:24:21,075
I don't think he'd
have given a shit.

188
00:24:25,621 --> 00:24:26,955
D'Amour.

189
00:24:26,997 --> 00:24:29,625
Why do I know that name?

190
00:24:30,793 --> 00:24:32,920
I know him.

191
00:24:32,961 --> 00:24:35,464
I saw him on TV.

192
00:24:35,547 --> 00:24:38,801
Some kid got possessed, and he
saved the little bastard's life.

193
00:24:39,635 --> 00:24:41,470
A priest?

194
00:24:49,311 --> 00:24:51,772
He's just some guy...

195
00:24:51,814 --> 00:24:54,066
who's got a nose for this shit.

196
00:24:55,317 --> 00:24:57,111
Like you.

197
00:25:00,531 --> 00:25:02,491
I don't want him
getting in the way.

198
00:25:02,574 --> 00:25:04,243
He won't.

199
00:25:07,162 --> 00:25:09,289
We've, all of us,
waited too long...

200
00:25:09,373 --> 00:25:12,126
to have the homecoming spoiled.

201
00:25:14,378 --> 00:25:16,755
What do you mean, "all of us"?

202
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:19,633
A lot of people believed in Nix.

203
00:25:19,675 --> 00:25:22,136
They haven't forgotten his promise.

204
00:25:24,888 --> 00:25:26,181
About?

205
00:25:26,265 --> 00:25:27,683
Death.

206
00:25:28,892 --> 00:25:30,352
What about death?

207
00:25:34,898 --> 00:25:37,234
It's an illusion.

208
00:26:03,927 --> 00:26:05,637
Coffee, Mrs. Swann?

209
00:26:05,721 --> 00:26:07,639
Yes, thank you.

210
00:26:09,767 --> 00:26:11,018
Where's Mr. Swann?

211
00:26:11,101 --> 00:26:12,686
In his study.

212
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:15,230
He got something on his mind?

213
00:26:29,787 --> 00:26:31,705
Hey. Mr. Sunshine.

214
00:26:37,252 --> 00:26:39,213
That's what I'm gonna call you.

215
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:43,509
Bad show?

216
00:26:48,389 --> 00:26:49,640
The usual.

217
00:26:49,723 --> 00:26:52,017
Full house.

218
00:26:52,101 --> 00:26:53,852
Standing ovation.

219
00:26:53,936 --> 00:26:55,604
I tell them it's magic.

220
00:26:55,687 --> 00:26:57,439
They believe you.

221
00:26:57,523 --> 00:26:58,941
Yeah.

222
00:27:04,446 --> 00:27:06,115
Remember Quaid?

223
00:27:07,908 --> 00:27:09,326
Sure.

224
00:27:13,205 --> 00:27:15,124
I think they killed him.

225
00:27:18,794 --> 00:27:20,087
Oh, God.

226
00:27:22,214 --> 00:27:24,216
I just saw him too.

227
00:27:32,808 --> 00:27:34,935
I'm putting in a new
illusion tonight.

228
00:27:36,478 --> 00:27:39,064
Something special.
I want you to be there.

229
00:27:44,194 --> 00:27:45,738
Of course.

230
00:27:47,156 --> 00:27:50,117
You want me to find
out about Quaid?

231
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,369
- I mean, the funeral?
- No.

232
00:27:56,206 --> 00:27:58,250
I'm not going anywhere near him.

233
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:14,767
Higher.

234
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:19,146
Another inch.

235
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:22,858
The left hand side is too low.

236
00:28:24,568 --> 00:28:25,652
Valentin?

237
00:28:28,572 --> 00:28:30,824
Good. There.

238
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:36,622
Yes?

239
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:41,210
I want you to find this
man D'Amour for me.

240
00:28:51,953 --> 00:28:53,914
Think any movie stars
buried around here?

241
00:28:54,915 --> 00:28:56,583
Probably.

242
00:28:56,666 --> 00:28:59,294
It's not a bad place.
It's warm, lots of palm trees.

243
00:28:59,377 --> 00:29:02,297
I don't think the dead much care.

244
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,799
You sure?

245
00:29:05,509 --> 00:29:07,427
- Are you a believer, then?
- Oh, yeah.

246
00:29:07,511 --> 00:29:10,430
I signed on for all
of them in my time.

247
00:29:10,514 --> 00:29:13,558
Catholic, Hindu, Moonies.

248
00:29:15,185 --> 00:29:17,103
You can't have too many saviors.

249
00:29:22,067 --> 00:29:24,277
Who's that?

250
00:29:24,361 --> 00:29:26,655
Swann's wife.

251
00:29:35,163 --> 00:29:38,125
I want you to help
me help my husband.

252
00:29:38,166 --> 00:29:43,130
He's in some kind of trouble... something
to do with the man you saw murdered.

253
00:29:44,131 --> 00:29:47,551
I think Philip believes all that
stuff with the tarot cards.

254
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,178
And you don't?

255
00:29:51,304 --> 00:29:53,765
I think we make our own futures.

256
00:29:56,017 --> 00:29:58,145
So, what's the connection?

257
00:29:58,228 --> 00:30:00,313
I don't exactly know.

258
00:30:00,397 --> 00:30:03,108
Philip doesn't like to
talk about the past.

259
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:04,609
Why not?

260
00:30:09,239 --> 00:30:11,366
He's a secretive man.

261
00:30:13,785 --> 00:30:15,704
And you don't ask questions?

262
00:30:17,914 --> 00:30:20,834
We don't share our lives the
way a lot of people do.

263
00:30:20,917 --> 00:30:23,879
But obviously you
still care about him.

264
00:30:23,962 --> 00:30:26,882
We wouldn't be having this
conversation if I didn't.

265
00:30:29,342 --> 00:30:32,304
Swann is one of the most
remarkable men alive.

266
00:30:34,681 --> 00:30:36,308
You don't believe me?

267
00:30:37,184 --> 00:30:40,228
He's an illusionist.
That's not exactly brain surgery.

268
00:30:41,354 --> 00:30:43,273
I'm sorry. You asked.

269
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:48,987
No, you're right.

270
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:53,074
He could've been something more.

271
00:30:53,158 --> 00:30:54,618
Maybe a lot more.

272
00:30:56,161 --> 00:30:59,664
But sometimes people get lost.
Even good people.

273
00:30:59,748 --> 00:31:03,418
- Too much money, too much fame.
- Where do I sign up?

274
00:31:06,588 --> 00:31:08,507
Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?

275
00:31:09,633 --> 00:31:12,177
- Harry.
- Harry.

276
00:31:13,136 --> 00:31:15,555
When do you want me to start?

277
00:31:15,597 --> 00:31:18,016
Come to the show with me.

278
00:31:18,058 --> 00:31:20,519
It's his last performance
in L.A. tonight.

279
00:31:22,062 --> 00:31:25,899
I want you to see him with
an audience. They love him.

280
00:31:26,942 --> 00:31:28,026
Do you?

281
00:31:29,778 --> 00:31:32,739
I didn't marry him for
love, Mr. D'Amour.

282
00:31:33,865 --> 00:31:35,951
- Tonight?
- Sure.

283
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:38,870
Okay.

284
00:32:31,423 --> 00:32:32,841
Excuse me.

285
00:32:35,093 --> 00:32:36,386
Sorry.

286
00:32:40,432 --> 00:32:42,392
- I'm glad you could make it.
- Are you kidding?

287
00:32:42,434 --> 00:32:44,394
This is a big deal for me.

288
00:32:45,604 --> 00:32:48,064
I gotta have the tux
back by midnight.

289
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:51,943
Valentin!

290
00:32:56,114 --> 00:32:57,574
I'm here.

291
00:32:58,909 --> 00:33:02,454
The guy with Dorothea...
is that him?

292
00:33:12,214 --> 00:33:14,674
- Check if he's ready.
- Ready?

293
00:33:15,926 --> 00:33:17,344
Ready.

294
00:33:46,832 --> 00:33:49,501
How the fuck does he do that?

295
00:33:49,584 --> 00:33:51,086
It's wires.

296
00:33:51,169 --> 00:33:54,297
- I don't see no wires.
- So, what is it? Magic?

297
00:33:56,633 --> 00:33:58,385
Ladies and gentlemen...

298
00:33:58,468 --> 00:34:02,389
you are standing on the
threshold of a miracle.

299
00:35:43,657 --> 00:35:46,660
Come with me into the great beyond.

300
00:35:51,289 --> 00:35:52,707
He's good.

301
00:35:52,791 --> 00:35:54,709
You haven't seen anything yet.

302
00:36:21,378 --> 00:36:23,588
This is the new illusion.

303
00:37:15,515 --> 00:37:18,226
Have you seen this before?

304
00:37:28,111 --> 00:37:29,988
There's something wrong here.

305
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:25,502
For God's sake!

306
00:38:25,585 --> 00:38:26,836
Wait! Who are you?

307
00:38:29,381 --> 00:38:30,590
Oh, God.

308
00:38:33,969 --> 00:38:35,053
Please.

309
00:38:38,974 --> 00:38:40,725
Please, Dorothea.

310
00:38:42,143 --> 00:38:43,562
Come away.

311
00:38:43,645 --> 00:38:45,230
It's no use.

312
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:43,288
I got you, you fucker!

313
00:39:52,714 --> 00:39:54,257
Who did this, D'Amour?

314
00:39:54,341 --> 00:39:55,926
Who killed Swann?

315
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,178
You did.

316
00:39:59,221 --> 00:40:00,931
Didn't you?

317
00:40:01,014 --> 00:40:02,098
Why would I?

318
00:40:02,182 --> 00:40:04,017
Beats me.

319
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:07,020
You don't have a clue
what you're into, do you?

320
00:40:07,103 --> 00:40:08,313
I feel it!

321
00:40:08,355 --> 00:40:10,023
Deep shit?

322
00:40:14,194 --> 00:40:15,487
Who did this?

323
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:19,366
It was...

324
00:40:20,533 --> 00:40:21,618
It was...

325
00:41:49,432 --> 00:41:51,851
And this Butterfield guy?

326
00:41:51,893 --> 00:41:53,019
Vanished.

327
00:41:54,312 --> 00:41:57,690
Another fucking magician. Jesus.

328
00:41:59,484 --> 00:42:01,402
You through with me?

329
00:42:03,446 --> 00:42:04,948
For now.

330
00:42:05,031 --> 00:42:07,534
You planning on moving
back to New York?

331
00:42:09,077 --> 00:42:10,537
No, not yet.

332
00:42:33,434 --> 00:42:35,395
- They treating you all right?
- Yeah.

333
00:42:38,857 --> 00:42:40,859
I heard what happened.

334
00:42:40,942 --> 00:42:43,945
I think I'm gonna stick
around for a while.

335
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:46,739
Maybe dig in places
that cops wouldn't look.

336
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:50,618
I wouldn't know where you'd start.

337
00:42:50,702 --> 00:42:52,954
Maybe with the other illusionists?

338
00:42:53,788 --> 00:42:55,707
They won't tell you anything.

339
00:42:56,624 --> 00:42:58,585
I can be very persuasive.

340
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,131
Yeah.

341
00:43:04,591 --> 00:43:06,509
I think you probably can.

342
00:43:24,609 --> 00:43:28,571
Now, down here is what
they call the repository.

343
00:43:29,947 --> 00:43:31,782
Behind those locked doors...

344
00:43:31,824 --> 00:43:35,620
lies every secret of
magic known to mankind.

345
00:43:36,454 --> 00:43:38,539
- Ever been in there?
- Me? No.

346
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:40,958
No, there are only three keys.

347
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,294
Vinovich has got one, of course.

348
00:43:44,378 --> 00:43:46,714
It is more than entertainment.

349
00:43:46,797 --> 00:43:49,383
We are opening up people's heads.

350
00:43:49,467 --> 00:43:54,263
We are bringing miracles back
into their miserable little lives.

351
00:43:54,305 --> 00:43:56,307
But they're fake miracles.

352
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:59,143
Houdini believed he
had spirit guides.

353
00:43:59,227 --> 00:44:00,645
Do you believe that?

354
00:44:00,686 --> 00:44:02,146
I believe...

355
00:44:02,188 --> 00:44:05,107
that we walk a narrow path...

356
00:44:05,149 --> 00:44:07,276
between...

357
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,653
Heaven and hell?

358
00:44:08,736 --> 00:44:10,321
Divinity and trickery.

359
00:44:12,198 --> 00:44:14,450
So then, sometimes...

360
00:44:14,492 --> 00:44:17,119
the miracles are real.

361
00:44:17,203 --> 00:44:19,205
No. They are always fake.

362
00:44:19,288 --> 00:44:22,667
The saints, the messiahs,
they were just illusionists.

363
00:44:22,708 --> 00:44:24,669
You could walk on water?

364
00:44:24,752 --> 00:44:29,674
I can reproduce any miracle
that has ever been performed...

365
00:44:29,715 --> 00:44:31,509
with a little preparation.

366
00:44:32,218 --> 00:44:33,970
Even one of Swann's?

367
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:38,850
- They were no damn good.
- Really?

368
00:44:38,933 --> 00:44:41,602
That's funny.
I heard he was one of the best.

369
00:44:41,686 --> 00:44:44,605
If he was so good,
why is he so dead?

370
00:44:46,691 --> 00:44:47,859
You tell me.

371
00:44:51,612 --> 00:44:53,781
I figured you'd have some theory.

372
00:44:53,865 --> 00:44:55,700
I have many theories.

373
00:44:55,741 --> 00:44:58,161
I'd like to hear one of them.

374
00:45:00,538 --> 00:45:02,456
I'm not saying another word.

375
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:05,001
You damn fool, Wilder.

376
00:45:05,042 --> 00:45:06,794
This man is a journalist.

377
00:45:06,878 --> 00:45:10,548
No, I'm not a journalist.
I just wanted to know about Swann.

378
00:45:10,631 --> 00:45:12,675
He was a freak.

379
00:45:12,758 --> 00:45:15,052
Everything he did was tainted.

380
00:45:15,136 --> 00:45:17,471
- With what?
- Evil!

381
00:45:17,555 --> 00:45:20,057
He was evil.

382
00:45:22,393 --> 00:45:23,811
Are you coming?

383
00:45:27,398 --> 00:45:31,861
Do not speak to this man if
you wish to keep my company.

384
00:45:31,903 --> 00:45:34,155
That's a great accent.
What is it, Brooklyn?

385
00:45:34,238 --> 00:45:35,823
Fuck you, all right?

386
00:45:53,132 --> 00:45:54,550
Harry.

387
00:46:15,863 --> 00:46:18,032
I've got to be careful.

388
00:46:18,115 --> 00:46:21,828
- If Vinovich sees me talking to you...
- What do you want, Billy?

389
00:46:21,911 --> 00:46:23,871
I heard a name.

390
00:46:24,997 --> 00:46:26,916
Someone they talk
about in whispers.

391
00:46:26,999 --> 00:46:28,376
Who?

392
00:46:29,502 --> 00:46:30,753
Nix.

393
00:46:33,548 --> 00:46:37,093
He's dead now, but I think
maybe he taught Swann.

394
00:46:37,176 --> 00:46:39,345
Who's doing the talking?

395
00:46:39,428 --> 00:46:41,264
Vinovich.

396
00:46:41,347 --> 00:46:43,266
But you burned your bridges there.

397
00:46:47,562 --> 00:46:48,896
This is me.

398
00:46:50,231 --> 00:46:51,482
Good luck.

399
00:46:54,235 --> 00:46:56,154
I loved what you did in there.

400
00:47:01,576 --> 00:47:02,910
What are you looking at?

401
00:47:13,546 --> 00:47:17,666
I just want to know what Philip saw in
those cards and stop it from happening.

402
00:47:21,971 --> 00:47:23,931
Divinity and trickery.

403
00:47:29,228 --> 00:47:32,148
Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared.

404
00:47:48,254 --> 00:47:51,272
- D'Amour.
- Harry, I know it's late.

405
00:47:52,607 --> 00:47:54,025
That's okay.

406
00:47:55,652 --> 00:47:57,237
How'd it go today?

407
00:47:59,205 --> 00:48:01,999
Went up to the Magic Castle.

408
00:48:03,418 --> 00:48:06,838
You were right. He didn't have
a lot of friends up there.

409
00:48:06,921 --> 00:48:08,506
They were jealous of him.

410
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:11,175
Why? Because he had you?

411
00:48:13,511 --> 00:48:15,930
He didn't have me. I told you.

412
00:48:15,972 --> 00:48:18,307
Yeah, you didn't
marry him for love.

413
00:48:18,391 --> 00:48:20,393
So, why did you marry him?

414
00:48:20,476 --> 00:48:22,437
That's none of your
business, Harry.

415
00:48:24,689 --> 00:48:27,733
You ever hear of
somebody called Nix?

416
00:48:31,779 --> 00:48:33,448
Dorothea?

417
00:48:39,203 --> 00:48:41,122
Yeah, I'm here.

418
00:48:42,248 --> 00:48:44,167
I don't know the name.

419
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:46,502
What about Jennifer Desiderio?

420
00:48:47,837 --> 00:48:49,797
It doesn't ring a bell.

421
00:48:50,506 --> 00:48:51,591
I have to go.

422
00:48:51,674 --> 00:48:53,134
That's it?

423
00:48:54,969 --> 00:48:57,889
All right. Look, I'll keep digging.

424
00:48:57,972 --> 00:49:00,391
Yeah. You do that.

425
00:49:14,614 --> 00:49:17,533
"Keep Out Police Department"

426
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:39,305
Ever watched a man die?

427
00:50:20,721 --> 00:50:22,306
Yes.

428
00:50:33,734 --> 00:50:35,862
"Desiderio."

429
00:50:49,167 --> 00:50:51,002
What are you doing here?

430
00:50:51,085 --> 00:50:53,004
Looking for you.

431
00:50:53,087 --> 00:50:56,340
- I tried the hotel.
- So why you'd come here?

432
00:50:56,424 --> 00:50:59,010
You're a detective with no clues.

433
00:50:59,093 --> 00:51:01,012
Where else would you look?

434
00:51:02,597 --> 00:51:04,223
Do you mind?

435
00:51:05,808 --> 00:51:07,268
I'll keep this brief.

436
00:51:08,644 --> 00:51:10,772
Here's $30,000.

437
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,608
What for?

438
00:51:13,691 --> 00:51:15,276
A ticket home.

439
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:20,573
You didn't hire me. She did. She wants
me to stop, I wanna hear it from her.

440
00:51:20,656 --> 00:51:23,534
- She doesn't want to see you.
- No?

441
00:51:23,618 --> 00:51:26,245
- People are dying here.
- Yes.

442
00:51:26,329 --> 00:51:28,998
It's a terrible tragedy.

443
00:51:29,082 --> 00:51:31,334
Is that all you have to say?

444
00:51:32,418 --> 00:51:34,504
It's a fucking terrible tragedy?

445
00:51:35,797 --> 00:51:38,716
- I want to know why.
- Why people die?

446
00:51:42,887 --> 00:51:46,307
Give it up, D'Amour. Go home.

447
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:51,562
Don't try to see her, D'Amour.

448
00:51:51,646 --> 00:51:53,773
Just leave her alone.

449
00:51:53,856 --> 00:51:55,983
Lock up, will you?

450
00:51:57,610 --> 00:52:00,279
Jennifer has only
ever had one visitor.

451
00:52:00,363 --> 00:52:02,865
- Mr. Quaid?
- Right.

452
00:52:03,783 --> 00:52:06,577
- He's dead, isn't he?
- Yeah.

453
00:52:06,619 --> 00:52:08,621
Heard it on the news.

454
00:52:08,704 --> 00:52:10,623
Jennifer doesn't know...

455
00:52:10,706 --> 00:52:13,501
and frankly, this isn't the
best time for her to be told.

456
00:52:13,584 --> 00:52:15,294
I won't say anything.

457
00:52:16,921 --> 00:52:20,800
She's been with us for four years
and she was coming along nicely.

458
00:52:22,135 --> 00:52:24,429
Past month she's been
worst than ever.

459
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:27,932
- What's her problem?
- She has no real grip on reality.

460
00:52:28,808 --> 00:52:31,519
- Does anybody?
- Oh, yes.

461
00:52:31,602 --> 00:52:35,314
We have to agree on what's real and not.
That's what holds us together.

462
00:52:36,315 --> 00:52:38,568
What does Jennifer think is real?

463
00:52:38,651 --> 00:52:40,695
She thinks the devil's
coming for her.

464
00:52:44,323 --> 00:52:46,242
Have we met before?

465
00:52:48,494 --> 00:52:50,204
Only I forget.

466
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:57,128
They give me pills, you
know, to make me even.

467
00:52:57,170 --> 00:52:59,005
And I...

468
00:52:59,088 --> 00:53:00,923
I forget things.

469
00:53:01,007 --> 00:53:02,508
You didn't forget me.

470
00:53:05,803 --> 00:53:09,557
I just came to see if you
remembered a man named Butterfield.

471
00:53:13,436 --> 00:53:15,229
Maybe. I...

472
00:53:20,059 --> 00:53:23,846
That's okay.
What about Philip Swann?

473
00:53:27,633 --> 00:53:29,010
I knew Swann.

474
00:53:31,971 --> 00:53:33,431
He's a fucking liar.

475
00:53:33,514 --> 00:53:35,057
Why is that?

476
00:53:35,141 --> 00:53:37,101
He said he knew how to protect us.

477
00:53:37,977 --> 00:53:39,896
But he didn't know anything.

478
00:53:41,898 --> 00:53:44,358
He made us think it was
over and done with.

479
00:53:44,442 --> 00:53:46,068
What was?

480
00:53:49,522 --> 00:53:51,824
I don't wanna think about it.

481
00:53:51,866 --> 00:53:53,993
If I think about it, he'll...

482
00:53:54,076 --> 00:53:55,995
he'll hear me.

483
00:53:56,078 --> 00:53:57,830
He'll find me.

484
00:53:57,872 --> 00:53:59,749
Swann?

485
00:53:59,832 --> 00:54:01,792
I told you. I don't want...

486
00:54:09,508 --> 00:54:10,843
What is it?

487
00:54:10,885 --> 00:54:12,470
Calm down.

488
00:54:14,639 --> 00:54:16,140
No, he'll get me!

489
00:54:16,182 --> 00:54:18,518
He's not... He's not...

490
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:22,522
Who's not gonna get you?

491
00:54:22,563 --> 00:54:24,190
Nix. Nix.

492
00:54:24,273 --> 00:54:26,317
- And he's the Puritan?
- Yes!

493
00:54:28,653 --> 00:54:30,738
- And he's dead?
- No.

494
00:54:30,821 --> 00:54:32,782
He's coming back.

495
00:54:32,865 --> 00:54:34,992
He's digging his way out.

496
00:54:35,076 --> 00:54:37,745
I'll take care of her now.

497
00:54:52,009 --> 00:54:53,594
Jesus.

498
00:55:15,819 --> 00:55:17,905
Billy. Harry D'Amour.

499
00:55:17,988 --> 00:55:19,365
Listen.

500
00:55:19,507 --> 00:55:23,702
Supposing I wanted to get into the
repository at the Magic Castle.

501
00:55:27,063 --> 00:55:28,648
There we go.

502
00:55:31,067 --> 00:55:33,195
You done something
like this before?

503
00:55:33,278 --> 00:55:34,988
I've had my moments.

504
00:55:36,406 --> 00:55:37,991
Hold that up.

505
00:55:41,703 --> 00:55:44,039
- They've gotta have this place rigged.
- How?

506
00:55:44,122 --> 00:55:46,041
It'll be something hokey.

507
00:56:06,711 --> 00:56:08,087
Whoa!

508
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,759
Let's have a look around.

509
00:56:48,253 --> 00:56:51,130
Butterfield's pal had this
carved on his forehead.

510
00:56:51,214 --> 00:56:53,132
Any idea what it is?

511
00:56:55,093 --> 00:56:56,511
Nope.

512
00:57:09,524 --> 00:57:12,569
What'd I tell you?
So fucking hokey.

513
00:57:18,116 --> 00:57:19,576
What have we got here?

514
00:57:27,584 --> 00:57:29,586
- Get the files.
- Fuck the files.

515
00:57:29,669 --> 00:57:32,380
Billy, get the files!

516
00:57:34,716 --> 00:57:36,259
Go on!

517
00:57:44,142 --> 00:57:45,226
Jesus!

518
00:57:46,311 --> 00:57:47,854
I could have lost my fucking hands!

519
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:53,151
That would have kept you
out of the magic circle...

520
00:57:53,193 --> 00:57:56,988
which was presumably the idea.

521
00:57:58,364 --> 00:58:00,116
Why don't you take a
look through these?

522
00:58:02,035 --> 00:58:03,494
Go on.

523
00:58:13,838 --> 00:58:15,256
These must be about Nix.

524
00:58:16,466 --> 00:58:17,675
The Puritan?

525
00:58:24,307 --> 00:58:25,517
Look at that.

526
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,101
A Nix specialty?

527
00:58:29,145 --> 00:58:31,105
I don't know any of these tricks.

528
00:58:32,632 --> 00:58:34,384
Maybe they're not tricks.

529
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:40,932
What did Vinovich say? Something
about walking the path between...

530
00:58:40,974 --> 00:58:43,226
Trickery and divinity.
He's saying that all the time.

531
00:58:43,268 --> 00:58:45,353
He said that because he knew.

532
00:58:45,437 --> 00:58:47,272
Son of a bitch.

533
00:58:47,313 --> 00:58:49,232
He'd seen these and he knew.

534
00:58:49,274 --> 00:58:50,442
Knew what?

535
00:59:21,264 --> 00:59:23,767
Get it off of me!
Where the fuck are you?

536
00:59:23,808 --> 00:59:25,560
Hold it right there.

537
00:59:26,478 --> 00:59:28,897
I said hold it...

538
00:59:50,335 --> 00:59:52,003
Hokey enough for you?

539
00:59:55,548 --> 00:59:57,509
I'm out of here, man.

540
01:00:01,513 --> 01:00:03,139
Comin'?

541
01:00:03,181 --> 01:00:04,641
Yeah.

542
01:00:05,683 --> 01:00:07,602
I'm comin'.

543
01:00:15,443 --> 01:00:16,945
I can't let you in.

544
01:00:31,876 --> 01:00:33,837
This is the way he wanted it.

545
01:00:36,214 --> 01:00:37,674
No autopsy...

546
01:00:39,217 --> 01:00:40,552
no embalming...

547
01:00:43,555 --> 01:00:45,640
nobody meddling with his body.

548
01:00:48,351 --> 01:00:50,520
"Flesh is a trap," he used to say.

549
01:00:51,729 --> 01:00:53,314
"Flesh is a trap...

550
01:00:56,025 --> 01:00:58,069
and magic sets us free."

551
01:01:00,989 --> 01:01:02,490
Why did you come back?

552
01:01:04,117 --> 01:01:06,286
I've been doing some digging.

553
01:01:06,369 --> 01:01:07,996
What did you find?

554
01:01:11,583 --> 01:01:14,419
Jennifer Desiderio, for one.

555
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:19,424
She threw herself in front
of a car this afternoon.

556
01:01:24,304 --> 01:01:26,598
Why don't you tell me the truth?

557
01:01:33,271 --> 01:01:35,523
Nix ran some kind of a cult, right?

558
01:01:37,108 --> 01:01:40,236
Some kind of a
Charlie Manson deal?

559
01:01:40,278 --> 01:01:42,614
It was more than that, I think.

560
01:01:43,782 --> 01:01:45,742
He was the real thing, wasn't he?

561
01:01:45,784 --> 01:01:47,494
Swann said he could do stuff.

562
01:01:48,703 --> 01:01:50,413
Like?

563
01:01:50,455 --> 01:01:52,957
He could levitate, juggle fire...

564
01:01:54,292 --> 01:01:57,378
and he could get into
people's heads...

565
01:01:57,504 --> 01:01:59,214
make them see things.

566
01:01:59,297 --> 01:02:01,508
- Terrible things.
- What things?

567
01:02:01,549 --> 01:02:03,926
I don't know.

568
01:02:03,927 --> 01:02:07,972
- And he taught some of this to Swann?
- Yes, some of it.

569
01:02:08,098 --> 01:02:11,643
So then, Swann wasn't
performing illusions.

570
01:02:11,684 --> 01:02:13,269
He was doing magic.

571
01:02:14,062 --> 01:02:15,438
Yes.

572
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:19,234
What? You thought he should
be using it to cure cancer...

573
01:02:19,317 --> 01:02:20,652
instead of making millions?

574
01:02:23,279 --> 01:02:26,116
- Look, I told you.
- Right. I know. Too much fame.

575
01:02:26,199 --> 01:02:29,452
That'd be enough to turn anybody's
head, including yours.

576
01:02:29,494 --> 01:02:30,745
Oh, fuck you.

577
01:02:30,829 --> 01:02:33,164
You're the one who said you
weren't with him for love.

578
01:02:33,206 --> 01:02:34,999
I wasn't.

579
01:02:35,083 --> 01:02:36,584
Then what?

580
01:02:38,503 --> 01:02:40,755
What the hell was going on here?

581
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:46,678
- I was grateful to him.
- For what?

582
01:02:46,719 --> 01:02:49,764
Everything I had I owed to him.

583
01:02:57,313 --> 01:02:58,898
And he loved me.

584
01:03:00,191 --> 01:03:02,694
He couldn't always show it,
but he felt it.

585
01:03:02,777 --> 01:03:05,280
He thought Nix was coming
back, didn't he?

586
01:03:10,452 --> 01:03:12,036
Didn't he?

587
01:03:15,248 --> 01:03:17,917
I can't help you
unless you talk to me!

588
01:03:19,127 --> 01:03:22,046
- You can't help me.
- You don't know that!

589
01:04:03,476 --> 01:04:05,061
I was so afraid.

590
01:04:05,419 --> 01:04:07,191
Don't be.

591
01:04:07,234 --> 01:04:09,753
Nix can't hurt you now.

592
01:04:13,765 --> 01:04:15,434
I know.

593
01:04:17,144 --> 01:04:19,062
I was the one who shot him.

594
01:04:21,815 --> 01:04:23,317
I was 12.

595
01:04:25,026 --> 01:04:28,738
Nix took me hostage to
get Swann to come to him.

596
01:04:30,323 --> 01:04:31,908
And they all came.

597
01:04:33,410 --> 01:04:35,787
- Yeah.
- Quaid and Jennifer and...

598
01:04:35,829 --> 01:04:37,831
Swann and Pimm.

599
01:04:43,169 --> 01:04:44,421
What was that?

600
01:04:50,051 --> 01:04:51,636
Valentin?

601
01:04:57,058 --> 01:04:58,643
Wait!

602
01:05:15,994 --> 01:05:17,245
What the hell?

603
01:05:28,131 --> 01:05:30,717
It's him. It's Nix.

604
01:05:32,052 --> 01:05:34,304
Dorothea, stay there.

605
01:06:50,547 --> 01:06:52,382
Find Valentin!

606
01:06:53,883 --> 01:06:56,678
Find him and get him in here. Now!

607
01:07:04,144 --> 01:07:05,478
This is sacrilege.

608
01:07:08,523 --> 01:07:10,609
Are you satisfied now?

609
01:07:13,695 --> 01:07:16,323
Don't worry. I'm not hurting him.

610
01:07:21,828 --> 01:07:24,456
Looks like you're not
a widow after all.

611
01:07:30,170 --> 01:07:31,755
Sit down.

612
01:07:35,967 --> 01:07:38,261
You rigged the illusion
to fail, right?

613
01:07:38,345 --> 01:07:39,596
Yes.

614
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,307
You set up the fake body?

615
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:46,144
And then what?

616
01:07:47,771 --> 01:07:51,441
Because I was getting too close
to something or someone...

617
01:07:51,524 --> 01:07:53,860
you called Swann?

618
01:07:53,902 --> 01:07:56,488
No. First I tried to pay you off.

619
01:07:58,531 --> 01:08:00,575
Was it Swann's idea?

620
01:08:02,452 --> 01:08:03,828
It was mine.

621
01:08:04,913 --> 01:08:06,998
I didn't want any more bloodshed.

622
01:08:07,082 --> 01:08:10,835
That's why we went to all this trouble.
So Nix would have no one to come after.

623
01:08:10,919 --> 01:08:14,547
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake!
What is wrong with you people?

624
01:08:14,631 --> 01:08:18,051
Haven't you seen enough to
know that doesn't matter?

625
01:08:19,928 --> 01:08:23,431
I want to meet with
Swann face to face.

626
01:08:23,556 --> 01:08:27,102
Why can't you just let this alone?

627
01:08:27,143 --> 01:08:29,396
Let everyone think it's over.

628
01:08:34,025 --> 01:08:35,610
Maybe he's right.

629
01:08:37,237 --> 01:08:39,990
Maybe we should just
let him stay dead.

630
01:10:24,636 --> 01:10:26,554
Couldn't stay away, could you?

631
01:10:34,104 --> 01:10:36,481
Had to see who cried
over you the most, huh?

632
01:10:38,483 --> 01:10:40,277
You know...

633
01:10:40,318 --> 01:10:44,406
a lot of people are gonna be pissed off
when they find out you're still alive.

634
01:10:51,621 --> 01:10:53,581
And they will, you know.

635
01:10:55,333 --> 01:10:58,795
No matter how much shit you bury
yourself under, you're gonna...

636
01:11:10,682 --> 01:11:13,143
You shouldn't have followed me.

637
01:11:14,185 --> 01:11:15,854
How do you do that?

638
01:11:16,855 --> 01:11:18,356
Now I'm going to have to kill you.

639
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:19,899
I don't think so.

640
01:11:20,984 --> 01:11:22,527
You need me alive.

641
01:11:22,652 --> 01:11:25,572
Why? So you can fuck
the woman I love?

642
01:11:25,697 --> 01:11:28,867
If you love her so much,
why did you widow her?

643
01:11:45,967 --> 01:11:47,761
What a waste.

644
01:11:47,844 --> 01:11:50,096
You can do shit that most
of us can only dream about.

645
01:11:51,556 --> 01:11:54,309
Then you go around pretending
it's just some trick.

646
01:11:55,101 --> 01:11:58,355
Illusionists get Las
Vegas contracts.

647
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:01,399
Magicians get burned.

648
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:03,318
Yeah, or murdered like Nix.

649
01:12:03,401 --> 01:12:06,696
Oh, he deserved it.

650
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:09,199
Maybe he doesn't feel that way.

651
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:12,827
Maybe he's digging himself out of
that hole you put him in right now.

652
01:12:12,911 --> 01:12:14,996
That's what you're
hiding away from, isn't?

653
01:12:15,872 --> 01:12:17,499
I did it for Dorothea.

654
01:12:18,583 --> 01:12:20,043
Yeah?

655
01:12:22,128 --> 01:12:26,257
Now that I'm dead,
the spotlight's off her.

656
01:12:26,299 --> 01:12:30,011
- So Nix won't be looking for her.
- I betrayed him.

657
01:12:31,137 --> 01:12:35,433
But she shot him. If I'm Nix,
that'd piss me off a little bit.

658
01:12:35,517 --> 01:12:37,893
I don't know what else to do.

659
01:12:37,894 --> 01:12:39,479
Help me.

660
01:12:42,148 --> 01:12:43,525
Look...

661
01:12:47,362 --> 01:12:50,031
if Nix is back from the dead...

662
01:12:50,073 --> 01:12:52,533
then he is some kind of a god...

663
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:55,328
and he'll find you
wherever the fuck you go.

664
01:12:56,246 --> 01:12:59,416
But if he's just another
phony messiah...

665
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:03,753
then you can stage the
greatest comeback in history.

666
01:13:32,490 --> 01:13:34,075
Who's there?

667
01:13:41,499 --> 01:13:42,959
Easy.

668
01:13:52,802 --> 01:13:54,554
I've sometimes thought...

669
01:13:54,596 --> 01:13:57,265
if I'd had another profession...

670
01:13:58,642 --> 01:14:00,852
I would have been a surgeon.

671
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:08,109
To be able to heal
with one little cut.

672
01:14:15,283 --> 01:14:18,453
Say that those eyes of
yours were troubling you.

673
01:14:21,414 --> 01:14:23,833
- Please.
- I could just scoop them out.

674
01:14:25,752 --> 01:14:27,212
No, don't.

675
01:14:27,295 --> 01:14:29,630
Then tell me where Nix is buried.

676
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:32,550
I don't know.

677
01:14:41,685 --> 01:14:43,687
Wait! Wait!

678
01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:50,360
I'll tell you.

679
01:14:50,485 --> 01:14:53,071
Oh, you'll do more than that.

680
01:15:16,026 --> 01:15:17,736
What is it?

681
01:15:26,786 --> 01:15:29,414
Did Dorothea know
where Nix was buried?

682
01:15:30,215 --> 01:15:31,815
No.

683
01:15:33,293 --> 01:15:35,128
Did Valentin?

684
01:15:35,470 --> 01:15:37,055
Yes.

685
01:15:51,402 --> 01:15:53,571
Do you like the look of these?

686
01:15:55,281 --> 01:15:56,908
I made them myself...

687
01:15:57,951 --> 01:15:59,577
to set him free.

688
01:16:00,870 --> 01:16:02,664
Why did you wait so long?

689
01:16:02,747 --> 01:16:05,917
I didn't have the skill...

690
01:16:05,959 --> 01:16:08,086
to resurrect him...

691
01:16:08,127 --> 01:16:10,296
to teach myself.

692
01:16:10,380 --> 01:16:12,465
That took time.

693
01:16:12,549 --> 01:16:16,010
Think he'll be in a fit state
to resurrect after 13 years?

694
01:16:16,094 --> 01:16:18,263
If he was just a man...

695
01:16:19,305 --> 01:16:21,599
like me, then no...

696
01:16:23,393 --> 01:16:26,646
but he's not.

697
01:16:29,941 --> 01:16:31,734
What is he, then?

698
01:16:33,486 --> 01:16:35,613
Maybe he'll show you.

699
01:16:43,454 --> 01:16:44,873
Anything?

700
01:16:46,249 --> 01:16:47,709
Not yet.

701
01:16:58,595 --> 01:17:01,472
- If you have lied to me...
- No, I swear!

702
01:17:01,598 --> 01:17:04,150
This is the place
Swann told me about.

703
01:17:04,192 --> 01:17:06,111
- The rocks...
- Five more minutes.

704
01:17:07,487 --> 01:17:10,365
- Are you hearing me?
- I'm doing my best.

705
01:17:20,291 --> 01:17:22,210
What have you got there?

706
01:17:23,795 --> 01:17:25,213
Fucker!

707
01:17:32,971 --> 01:17:34,556
Butterfield!

708
01:17:39,352 --> 01:17:41,145
He's in the corner!

709
01:17:41,146 --> 01:17:42,939
Don't touch him.

710
01:17:59,706 --> 01:18:01,333
It's him.

711
01:18:32,947 --> 01:18:35,116
Oh, Jesus Christ!

712
01:18:57,764 --> 01:18:59,432
Smell it.

713
01:19:02,435 --> 01:19:04,562
He's coming. He's coming.

714
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:07,440
He will come.

715
01:19:57,615 --> 01:19:59,784
Help me!

716
01:20:01,119 --> 01:20:02,954
Get out of the car.

717
01:20:02,996 --> 01:20:05,165
Get out of the fuckin' car!

718
01:20:23,016 --> 01:20:24,851
He's got Dorothea.

719
01:20:25,685 --> 01:20:28,688
- And Nix?
- Yes.

720
01:20:28,772 --> 01:20:31,191
- Don't bother about me.
- Shut up!

721
01:20:31,274 --> 01:20:33,193
We've already lost enough lives.

722
01:20:33,234 --> 01:20:37,155
Please accept my
apologies, D'Amour.

723
01:20:37,197 --> 01:20:38,531
For what?

724
01:20:38,615 --> 01:20:41,618
You're going to lose one more.

725
01:20:48,333 --> 01:20:49,501
No!

726
01:20:49,542 --> 01:20:51,795
He's better off this way.

727
01:20:53,254 --> 01:20:55,256
Nobody's better off this way.

728
01:20:55,340 --> 01:20:57,509
You don't get it, do you?

729
01:21:00,887 --> 01:21:02,972
This is where we're all goin'.

730
01:21:19,239 --> 01:21:21,282
Do you wish him amongst us?

731
01:21:21,366 --> 01:21:23,243
Yes.

732
01:21:23,284 --> 01:21:25,370
Will you come unto
him upon your knees?

733
01:21:28,039 --> 01:21:29,916
Be ready.

734
01:21:59,112 --> 01:22:02,449
Listen.
You got everything you want.

735
01:22:02,490 --> 01:22:03,992
You don't need me.

736
01:22:04,075 --> 01:22:07,495
No, but he will,
after what you did to him.

737
01:22:08,455 --> 01:22:10,415
He'll want vengeance.

738
01:23:50,098 --> 01:23:52,100
Christ in heaven!

739
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:56,896
My lord.

740
01:23:56,938 --> 01:23:59,315
He's coming home.

741
01:24:03,778 --> 01:24:05,739
He's with us.

742
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:07,824
He's with us.

743
01:24:10,994 --> 01:24:12,662
Hold her!

744
01:24:46,196 --> 01:24:48,114
Open your eyes.

745
01:24:57,832 --> 01:24:59,417
He's with us.

746
01:25:23,650 --> 01:25:25,610
Where is Swann?

747
01:25:28,530 --> 01:25:31,116
- He's dead.
- No, he isn't.

748
01:25:37,038 --> 01:25:38,707
I swear.

749
01:25:53,054 --> 01:25:54,514
Children.

750
01:25:59,352 --> 01:26:02,188
Will you suffer to come unto me?

751
01:26:18,455 --> 01:26:19,914
Jesus.

752
01:26:21,666 --> 01:26:23,793
What the hell is goin' on in there?

753
01:26:25,003 --> 01:26:28,298
At a guess, they just
resurrected him.

754
01:26:32,552 --> 01:26:34,012
Fuck!

755
01:26:34,137 --> 01:26:38,433
I've come back to bring you
the wisdom of the grave.

756
01:26:39,684 --> 01:26:42,228
- Will you hear it?
- Yes.

757
01:26:48,818 --> 01:26:50,779
Follow me.

758
01:27:02,123 --> 01:27:04,876
Do I know you, child?

759
01:27:07,462 --> 01:27:08,922
Yes.

760
01:27:10,423 --> 01:27:12,634
I do, don't I?

761
01:27:12,717 --> 01:27:15,929
No gun this time, child?

762
01:27:19,474 --> 01:27:21,309
Where is Swann?

763
01:27:24,813 --> 01:27:26,773
I don't know where he is.

764
01:27:30,652 --> 01:27:32,570
He'll come.

765
01:27:32,654 --> 01:27:36,700
We have unfinished
business, he and I.

766
01:28:04,978 --> 01:28:06,688
This is where we killed him.

767
01:28:17,449 --> 01:28:19,743
Looks like you didn't
try hard enough.

768
01:28:21,161 --> 01:28:23,663
I can't go any further.

769
01:28:28,835 --> 01:28:32,714
Where is she, you fuck, huh?

770
01:28:32,756 --> 01:28:35,633
Are you ready for my wisdom?

771
01:28:38,553 --> 01:28:42,057
Here is my wisdom.

772
01:28:58,281 --> 01:29:00,075
Go! Help her!

773
01:29:06,331 --> 01:29:09,084
You see, I escaped
from the grave...

774
01:29:09,125 --> 01:29:14,005
so I have to give something
to the grave in return.

775
01:29:14,089 --> 01:29:16,299
Yes. Show us.

776
01:29:16,383 --> 01:29:18,134
Show us, Puritan.

777
01:29:45,996 --> 01:29:48,581
I have to give something back...

778
01:29:48,665 --> 01:29:51,251
so I'm giving you.

779
01:29:52,627 --> 01:29:54,254
What's happening?

780
01:30:31,624 --> 01:30:33,084
Go ahead, bleed.

781
01:30:33,168 --> 01:30:34,627
Bleed!

782
01:31:29,557 --> 01:31:30,850
What are you doing?

783
01:31:39,734 --> 01:31:42,946
You're not worthy.

784
01:31:43,029 --> 01:31:44,322
None of you.

785
01:31:44,406 --> 01:31:46,366
Fuck you!

786
01:31:47,158 --> 01:31:51,037
Only Swann is worthy.

787
01:31:51,913 --> 01:31:54,708
You just waited like lambs.

788
01:32:08,054 --> 01:32:10,557
I'm not your shepherd.

789
01:33:03,026 --> 01:33:04,986
You're not Swann.

790
01:33:05,070 --> 01:33:06,738
Who are you?

791
01:33:07,697 --> 01:33:10,700
Oh, I know what you want.

792
01:33:17,607 --> 01:33:18,792
Hold on!

793
01:33:20,552 --> 01:33:22,295
Nix!

794
01:33:24,881 --> 01:33:26,966
There you are.

795
01:33:27,050 --> 01:33:28,968
Come on!

796
01:33:29,252 --> 01:33:31,921
I've had a long time...

797
01:33:32,005 --> 01:33:33,715
to think about you.

798
01:33:34,632 --> 01:33:37,719
Where did I go wrong?

799
01:33:38,761 --> 01:33:40,013
And?

800
01:33:40,096 --> 01:33:43,391
I should have been honest
with you from the start.

801
01:33:43,733 --> 01:33:48,187
I wasn't born to show people
the error of their ways.

802
01:33:48,271 --> 01:33:50,899
I was born...

803
01:33:50,940 --> 01:33:53,443
to murder the world.

804
01:33:53,484 --> 01:33:56,404
You can still help me
do that if you want.

805
01:33:56,446 --> 01:33:58,406
Why would I wanna do that?

806
01:33:58,448 --> 01:34:02,243
The lady has a new
love in her life.

807
01:34:02,285 --> 01:34:05,538
Your friends are all dead.

808
01:34:05,622 --> 01:34:08,166
No one can save you now...

809
01:34:08,249 --> 01:34:10,168
but me.

810
01:34:15,131 --> 01:34:17,592
- Come on!
- We can't leave him there!

811
01:34:20,261 --> 01:34:22,263
I'm not going to!

812
01:34:27,518 --> 01:34:29,103
Bitch!

813
01:34:31,064 --> 01:34:32,815
Butterfield!

814
01:34:32,899 --> 01:34:34,567
Will you help me?

815
01:34:36,194 --> 01:34:37,445
Yes.

816
01:34:37,529 --> 01:34:40,990
Now you know I will kill you
when we're done. I have to.

817
01:34:42,617 --> 01:34:44,827
- Yes.
- But until then...

818
01:34:44,911 --> 01:34:47,497
it'll be just the two of us...

819
01:34:47,580 --> 01:34:49,999
the way it always was.

820
01:34:51,751 --> 01:34:52,585
Yes.

821
01:34:58,049 --> 01:34:59,342
Wait.

822
01:34:59,425 --> 01:35:02,929
You still feel something
for that bitch?

823
01:35:05,306 --> 01:35:06,349
Yes.

824
01:35:06,558 --> 01:35:07,767
Will...

825
01:35:11,020 --> 01:35:12,647
you...

826
01:35:14,190 --> 01:35:15,525
never...

827
01:35:17,694 --> 01:35:20,113
learn?

828
01:35:35,879 --> 01:35:38,298
She's just flesh...

829
01:35:38,381 --> 01:35:40,300
Swannie boy!

830
01:35:42,093 --> 01:35:43,678
I'll show you.

831
01:36:07,179 --> 01:36:08,879
Dorothea?

832
01:36:12,117 --> 01:36:13,406
Dorothea?

833
01:36:16,579 --> 01:36:20,799
Where is she?
Where did she go?

834
01:36:21,792 --> 01:36:24,545
You've got Swann's disease.

835
01:36:24,629 --> 01:36:28,257
You think that with a little
courage and a little love...

836
01:36:28,299 --> 01:36:30,676
that it'll all be all right.

837
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:39,393
Tell me where she is and
I'll make it go away.

838
01:36:53,074 --> 01:36:54,075
Dig, D'Amour.

839
01:36:56,327 --> 01:36:57,745
Touch the darkness.

840
01:36:59,330 --> 01:37:01,123
It's been waiting for you.

841
01:37:16,264 --> 01:37:18,182
Harry, it's not real.

842
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:21,310
Now listen to me.

843
01:37:21,394 --> 01:37:22,937
Look at me!

844
01:37:25,565 --> 01:37:26,941
You'll be okay.

845
01:37:27,024 --> 01:37:29,860
There you are, child.

846
01:37:31,529 --> 01:37:33,364
Come along, child.

847
01:38:04,854 --> 01:38:06,689
What are you seeing now?

848
01:38:15,156 --> 01:38:16,240
There.

849
01:38:46,646 --> 01:38:47,980
One...

850
01:38:48,064 --> 01:38:49,565
last...

851
01:38:50,942 --> 01:38:52,276
illusion.

852
01:38:55,071 --> 01:38:57,073
What's it going to be?

853
01:38:57,156 --> 01:39:01,077
- Fire to burn out your eyes?
- Let's go!

854
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:04,205
I'm sure Swann loved your eyes.

855
01:39:05,164 --> 01:39:08,751
You shouldn't have taken
him away from me.

856
01:39:09,961 --> 01:39:12,964
We were going to be together...

857
01:39:13,047 --> 01:39:15,091
when I finished with the world.

858
01:39:15,174 --> 01:39:17,468
We were going to keep
each other company...

859
01:39:17,551 --> 01:39:19,178
in the dark.

860
01:39:24,809 --> 01:39:27,562
But I'm on my own.

861
01:39:27,645 --> 01:39:30,439
We're all on our own.

862
01:39:31,983 --> 01:39:34,235
The grave is lonely.

863
01:39:35,903 --> 01:39:38,239
But living is worse.

864
01:39:41,742 --> 01:39:43,661
What the fuck are you?

865
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:46,747
A man who wanted to be a god...

866
01:39:48,416 --> 01:39:51,377
then changed his mind.

867
01:39:51,460 --> 01:39:54,630
I'm going to be rotten
shit from now on.

868
01:39:56,757 --> 01:39:58,259
The car.

869
01:40:01,012 --> 01:40:02,972
Can you raise me up like the car?

870
01:40:03,014 --> 01:40:07,894
I'm going to show the world
what's waiting at the end.

871
01:40:07,977 --> 01:40:10,229
And I am going to make it...

872
01:40:11,564 --> 01:40:13,274
despair.

873
01:40:47,642 --> 01:40:48,851
Fucker!

874
01:41:16,087 --> 01:41:17,922
It's me.

875
01:41:54,384 --> 01:41:55,968
Is it finished?

876
01:41:59,347 --> 01:42:00,848
I think so.

877
01:42:29,252 --> 01:42:30,712
Run.

878
01:42:31,879 --> 01:42:33,756
Run!

879
01:43:37,904 --> 01:43:40,823
And the fire said to me...

880
01:43:40,865 --> 01:43:42,450
said to me...

881
01:43:44,786 --> 01:43:46,204
Hush!

882
01:43:48,364 --> 01:43:52,868
You will see flesh
with a god's eyes.

883
01:43:55,621 --> 01:43:58,666
I was born...

884
01:43:58,708 --> 01:44:00,876
to murder the world.

885
01:44:06,966 --> 01:44:08,935
"Flesh is a trap."

886
01:44:09,018 --> 01:44:10,937
That's what he used to say.

887
01:44:12,271 --> 01:44:14,607
"Flesh is a trap...

888
01:44:14,691 --> 01:44:16,984
and magic sets us free."

889
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:20,090
