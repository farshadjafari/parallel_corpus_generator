1
00:00:53,509 --> 00:00:56,515
You're just
having a bad dream.
That's all, baby.

2
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,350
That's all it was.

3
00:00:59,435 --> 00:01:03,395
Bad dreams make
you think you've seen
things that you haven't.

4
00:01:04,775 --> 00:01:08,275
You know what I do
when I have a bad dream?

5
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:11,739
I close my eyes
and I think of
something nice.

6
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:15,200
Like being
here with you.

7
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:47,604
Hurry up, sweetheart.
We're gonna be late.

8
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:59,700
[birds squawking]

9
00:02:22,474 --> 00:02:24,645
[doorbell rings]

10
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:33,069
[whispers]
Shit.

11
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,805
Jack?

12
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,055
Did you see someone
ring my doorbell?

13
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:04,685
No.

14
00:03:06,354 --> 00:03:07,729
Okay, thanks.

15
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,307
I cleaned everything
away, sweetheart.

16
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,143
Everything is exactly
the way it was before.

17
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,854
They're clean
and shiny. Look.
Look. You see?

18
00:03:50,938 --> 00:03:52,147
[cries]

19
00:03:52,231 --> 00:03:54,734
Okay, all right.
Just close your eyes.

20
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,687
Well, hello, sailor.

21
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:32,896
Hi!

22
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,398
Permission to
come aboard?

23
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:37,985
Honey, hold this.

24
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,781
So sorry we couldn't make
it yesterday. Somebody
was working late again.

25
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,283
How're you doing, Sal?

26
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:46,869
I'm good.
How are you?

27
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:49,372
I'm all right.

28
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,706
Look at you.

29
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,749
Do you like it?

30
00:04:51,832 --> 00:04:53,209
You look great.

31
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,211
Really? I just
kinda threw it on.

32
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,254
She's had outfits
laid out for a week.

33
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:59,923
You're such a liar.
You know my husband.

34
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:02,384
I don't listen
to what he says.
You know that.

35
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:05,303
I brought my really
good friend, Heather.
She's so nice.

36
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:08,014
Promise me
you'll be attentive.

37
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,394
How're you doing, man?

38
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,230
She's not
to bring anyone.

39
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:18,526
You don't like her?
Believe me, she's the best
looking of Sally's friends.

40
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,696
Which it doesn't
say much.

41
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,822
I asked you not to.

42
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:27,617
You're living on a boat
with an 18-year old boy
and you're saying no girls.

43
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,788
Greg, this is Heather.

44
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:34,792
She's a very good friend
of mine, and I just thought
you guys should meet.

45
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,252
Hi.

46
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,336
Hi.

47
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,675
Can you just excuse me
for a moment?

48
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,928
Jess. You okay?

49
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,764
I don't think so.

50
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,600
Hey. What happened?

51
00:05:55,312 --> 00:05:58,606
Hey. What's the matter?

52
00:05:58,692 --> 00:05:59,858
I'm sorry.

53
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:02,153
You've got nothing
to apologize for.

54
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:03,987
What is it?
Are you okay?

55
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,031
I'm just tired.

56
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:09,367
Well, listen, we don't
have to go today if
you don't want to.

57
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,454
No, we do.
I-I wanna go.

58
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,206
You sure?

59
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,711
Yeah.

60
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:21,922
Yeah.

61
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,841
Yeah? Okay, come on.
Come up here.

62
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,891
This is Sally and
her husband, Downey.

63
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,726
This is Heather,
Sally's friend.
You remember Victor.

64
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,687
So let's go sailing!

65
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:39,064
Okay.

66
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,744
(Heather)
Hey.

67
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,495
You okay?

68
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,624
Is Greg okay?

69
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,584
He's fine.
He's upstairs.

70
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,879
You've been asleep
for a couple of hours.

71
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,255
I had this terrible dream.

72
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:28,716
What about?

73
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,925
I don't remember.

74
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,720
I wouldn't worry.

75
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:36,056
Apparently bad dreams
cure you of real
life stress.

76
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:40,144
As indeed
does champagne.
You want some?

77
00:08:40,227 --> 00:08:42,187
Yeah.

78
00:08:44,231 --> 00:08:46,232
Downey, wanna give me
a hand, please?

79
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:50,446
Actually, Victor, I'm
a guest of the Captain's,
but yes, I will help you.

80
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:53,615
Victor, what was that
back there at the harbor?

81
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,116
What?

82
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,995
I asked Jess if
she was all right
and you said no.

83
00:08:58,078 --> 00:09:00,581
You told me she was
bringing the little
boy along.

84
00:09:00,664 --> 00:09:04,460
When I was walking
with her in the harbor
I asked where he was.

85
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:06,586
She couldn't remember.

86
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,755
She stared into space
for like 20 seconds

87
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,883
and then she said
he's at school.

88
00:09:10,966 --> 00:09:13,052
So?

89
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:16,179
Well, it's Saturday.
Ain't no school today.

90
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:20,017
Her son goes to a special
needs school and it's
open every day.

91
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,394
Be nice to her.

92
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,648
All right.

93
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:26,774
All right.

94
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,109
Do you boys
sunbathe together?

95
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,820
Sometimes.

96
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:36,325
The champagne is not
great but it is cold.
Want some?

97
00:09:36,408 --> 00:09:37,368
No thanks.

98
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,327
Okay, more for me.

99
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,663
Hey, how are you feeling?

100
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,832
I'm sorry, I didn't
realize how tired I was.

101
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:48,379
You apologize one more
time, and I'm gonna
throw you overboard.

102
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,841
Here.

103
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,176
You all right?

104
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,927
Yeah.

105
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,943
He thinks we're
a fishing boat.

106
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,321
He's gonna go hungry.

107
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,200
You want to steer?

108
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,743
Nah.

109
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:22,453
Go on.

110
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,543
Which way
do I aim?

111
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:29,628
You're gonna
aim that way.

112
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,966
It's easy, right?

113
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,053
So, she's a waitress
at some diner.

114
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,724
At least there
they talk. They
became friends.

115
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,892
Oh, and she has
an autistic son.

116
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,269
So they're just friends.

117
00:10:45,352 --> 00:10:46,937
Sally!

118
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:49,731
What do you want me
to say? I'm sorry she
has a retarded son?

119
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,482
Yeah!

120
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,945
Well, I'm sorry.
You know, that's not
Greg's problem, that's hers.

121
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,864
What is it,
is it the shorts?

122
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:59,908
No! Heather, Greg's
been my friend for
a really long time.

123
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,535
I can't just sit back
and watch him get
shaken down.

124
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,120
She isn't doing that.

125
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:07,750
Well, I hope not
because Greg is
far too trusting.

126
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,793
I'm kinda
linking the boy.

127
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:13,087
Uh, no, you're not.
Can you please go up
there and talk to Greg?

128
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:16,133
I really think
the two of you will
be perfect for each other.

129
00:11:16,216 --> 00:11:19,510
And I really don't like
seeing him with her.

130
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,847
Jess, are you ready?

131
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,017
Yeah, let her go.

132
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,609
Yeah.

133
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,196
Woo!

134
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,990
(Jess)
So, how do you
know everyone?

135
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:43,076
Victor, he's staying
with me for good.

136
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,287
He got in trouble
at home. He had
to get away.

137
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,831
I found him sleeping
behind the store
at the harbor.

138
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:51,960
You know, we got talking,
and now he lives here.

139
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,879
Just like that
you let him move in?

140
00:11:53,962 --> 00:11:56,840
Well, I got three rooms.
I can't sleep in them all.

141
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:59,634
And Downey,
I've known him
since I was a kid.

142
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,471
Sally, his wife,
I know her from
high school.

143
00:12:02,554 --> 00:12:05,099
I dated her
for like four days
in the eighth grade,

144
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:08,601
so technically
she's my ex.

145
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,354
They seem really nice.

146
00:12:10,437 --> 00:12:14,482
Yeah. Except for the fact
that every year they
feel obliged

147
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,945
to bring me
an eligible girl.

148
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:20,239
Maybe they think
you're lonely.

149
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,323
Do I give off
lonely to you?

150
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,118
Sometimes.

151
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:27,913
When I come to see you
at the diner, I'm not
lonely, I'm hungry.

152
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:32,250
Obviously yesterday
was different.

153
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:33,710
What happened yesterday?

154
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:36,504
Yesterday I was
not hungry.

155
00:12:36,588 --> 00:12:39,341
I came in with the sole
purpose of inviting
you sailing.

156
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,802
You did?

157
00:12:41,885 --> 00:12:43,595
I did.

158
00:12:48,308 --> 00:12:50,852
Turn at port side.
We're losing wind.

159
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,937
Let me check it
for just a sec.

160
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:01,028
So, things are
okay with Tommy?

161
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,030
The same.

162
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,866
Every day is the same.

163
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,744
Tommy likes the things
to be a certain way. Yeah.

164
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:11,498
If I do one thing
differently, I lose him.

165
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:17,211
What's the matter?
I've never seen you
like this before.

166
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:21,341
I don't know. I just, uh,
I just feel guilty when
I'm not with Tommy.

167
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,302
That's because
you're a good mother.

168
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:27,346
But you can't
be everywhere
all of the times.

169
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,975
Hey, guys. Oh!
[laughs]

170
00:13:30,058 --> 00:13:32,059
How is it going?

171
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,104
We're good.

172
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:39,025
I was just wondering
if I could steal Jess
away from you.

173
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,195
Sally's dying
to talk to her.

174
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:44,072
We're kind of in the middle
of something right now.

175
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,200
No, no, it's okay.
I-I should circulate.

176
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:52,538
Hey, just for the record,

177
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:55,792
I'm not interested.

178
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,101
Yo, what the fuck?

179
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:17,648
Wind's dropped down on us.

180
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,235
It's not dropped,
it's gone.

181
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,158
(Victor)
This is crazy.

182
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:31,161
You ever seen
this before?

183
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:34,706
Yeah, yeah. Just not
quite so sudden.

184
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,043
Are we okay to get
home? There is no wind.

185
00:14:38,126 --> 00:14:40,629
Yeah, yeah. We got
an engine. It's not
a problem.

186
00:14:40,712 --> 00:14:44,216
It's just, it's weird.

187
00:14:44,299 --> 00:14:46,176
Greg?

188
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,096
Is that normal?

189
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,816
[thundering]

190
00:15:14,746 --> 00:15:17,456
(Downey)
Okay, I'm fucking
freaked, what the fuck.

191
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,312
Triangle to coast
guard. Over.

192
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,897
[radio interference]

193
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,482
Triangle to coast
guard. Over.

194
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:44,900
[interference]

195
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,986
Coast guard,
go ahead. Over.

196
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:51,575
We've just gone from seven
knots to absolute zero. You've
got anything unusual? Over?

197
00:15:51,658 --> 00:15:54,452
Nothing showing up. Over.

198
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:59,457
It's darkening up pretty
quick out here. Looks like
an electrical storm. Over.

199
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:02,918
[distressed woman]
Help me. Please.
Can you hear me?

200
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:05,672
Help me.
Please, help me.

201
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:09,759
Killing everyone. They're
dead. They're all dead.

202
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:13,221
We hear you.
What's your
position? Over.

203
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,557
[interference]

204
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:19,311
Distressed caller,
we hear you. What are
your coordinates? Over.

205
00:16:19,394 --> 00:16:21,229
[interference]

206
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:25,192
Coast guard, did you hear
a distress call? We're not
getting it anymore. Over.

207
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:30,113
Distressed caller,
make another transmission.
What is your position?

208
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,282
(Heather)
Greg?

209
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,659
[rumbling]

210
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,927
Get below deck now.
Get the life jackets.

211
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,250
Cut it.
Cut the sail.

212
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:28,963
Vic, get the main
sail down.

213
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,007
Get it down.

214
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:34,260
[shouting]

215
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,847
Vic!

216
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:39,682
No!

217
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,734
[shouts]

218
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,323
Get back.

219
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,866
[Jess shouts]

220
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:59,577
Jess, take my hand.

221
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:00,996
Grab on.

222
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:03,457
Heather!

223
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,756
Grab on.

224
00:18:17,637 --> 00:18:19,597
Heather!

225
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:26,771
Vic!

226
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,718
Jess.

227
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,477
Are you okay?

228
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,144
All right.

229
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,980
[Downey coughs]

230
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:10,272
Downey?

231
00:19:12,984 --> 00:19:14,528
Are you guys okay?

232
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:17,154
Have you seen Heather?
She got lost through
the window.

233
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,490
No. Come on, come on.

234
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,660
Heather!

235
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:25,497
Heather!

236
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,960
Greg! Help me!

237
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,336
(Greg)
Sally. Sally.

238
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,756
Just give me
your hand.

239
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,842
Heather!

240
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:06,746
Are you guys okay?

241
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,205
Yeah.

242
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,382
Are you all right?

243
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,679
Tommy's at school, yeah?

244
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,893
He'll be looked after
until we get back.
He'll be all right.

245
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,113
[squawking]

246
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:11,894
Thank God. Yo!
Help us!

247
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:16,732
[all at a time]
Help us. Help.
Help us. Over here.

248
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:19,568
Oh, God.

249
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,695
Hey. Hey.

250
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,616
[all at a time]
Wait. Come on,
over here!

251
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,411
There, there. Over there.
I can see someone.

252
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:31,498
(Victor)
Yo, we need some
help down here.

253
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:35,460
(Sally)
Help us, please!

254
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,296
Hello. We need
some help down here.

255
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:41,048
Yeah, he's seen us.
He's seen us.

256
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,844
(Greg)
Oh, thank God.

257
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,813
Jump, jump, jump.

258
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:59,776
Okay. Jess,
come on, come on.

259
00:21:59,859 --> 00:22:02,237
Jess. Come on.

260
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,446
Come on, come on,
take my hand. Okay.

261
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:07,659
Okay. You okay?

262
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:27,220
(Downey)
You okay? Yeah?

263
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:32,224
Hey.

264
00:22:32,308 --> 00:22:34,519
How is it?

265
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:38,189
See? I told you.

266
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,525
Hello?

267
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,500
Hello?

268
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:00,420
Hello!

269
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,925
Do we wait?

270
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,595
No, let's go
to the bridge.

271
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:11,472
We'll get the captain
to put a call out to
the coast guard.

272
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,223
We'll get a search
for Heather.

273
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,439
Come on.

274
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:23,902
Do you think Heather
would've made it
on board?

275
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,028
Honey.

276
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,779
There's a chance,
isn't there?

277
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:29,782
(Downey)
Yeah. Yeah,
there's a chance.

278
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:58,103
Hello?

279
00:24:00,396 --> 00:24:02,231
Hello?

280
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:17,288
Hello!

281
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,920
(Sally)
Somebody please help us?

282
00:24:26,714 --> 00:24:28,465
Hello?

283
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:43,730
(Victor)
Where the fuck
is everybody?

284
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:47,317
(Downey)
You don't even now
where we're going.

285
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:50,864
Well, we're just,
just walking for
the sake of it.

286
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:06,296
You all right?

287
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:09,507
I feel like
I know this place.

288
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:13,970
I recognize
this corridor.

289
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:18,766
Liners, they look
pretty similar.

290
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,269
No, that's not it.

291
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,855
(Victor)
Come check this out.

292
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,732
This is the same ship.
This thing's old.

293
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:28,276
Jess.

294
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,863
Come on.
Come on.

295
00:25:31,946 --> 00:25:35,657
1932. It's the same.
Here's where we boarded.

296
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:38,786
Oh, yeah.

297
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,954
Aeolus.

298
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,708
Aeolus.

299
00:25:43,791 --> 00:25:47,295
Aeolus was the Greek
god of the winds and
the father of Sisyphus,

300
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:50,632
the man condemned by the gods
to the task of pushing a rock
up a mountain

301
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,634
and let it see
roll back down again.

302
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:54,676
That's a shitty
punishment. What
did he do?

303
00:25:54,802 --> 00:25:58,597
He cheated Death.
No, he made a promise
to Death that he didn't keep.

304
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:02,977
I studied it but I can't
remember. Can we just
keep on moving, please?

305
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,270
[clank]

306
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,483
Hello?

307
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:34,509
Whoever it was
might wanna come
back for these.

308
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,426
Let me see?

309
00:26:39,847 --> 00:26:42,016
These are mine.

310
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,393
These are my keys.

311
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:44,894
What are you
talking about?

312
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:45,979
They're mine.

313
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:47,396
Bullshit.

314
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,565
This is, this is
my house key.

315
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:53,694
This is my, my car key.
This is my son. See?

316
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,989
Wait. So you had them
with you on the yacht?

317
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:58,156
Yes.

318
00:26:58,241 --> 00:26:59,409
It's gotta be Heather.

319
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:00,535
Come on.

320
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:02,412
How else did
they get here?

321
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:06,332
It was Heather dropping
her keys but not bothering
to say, "I didn't drown."

322
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,625
Why not?

323
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:12,297
(Greg)
Come on.

324
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:18,010
(Sally)
Heather?

325
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:34,861
Looks like you get your
welcome party, just
not the welcome.

326
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,494
Heather!

327
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,580
Yo, Greg, what
time you got?

328
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:49,000
Eleven thirty.

329
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,001
Heather.

330
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,712
Heather!

331
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,095
Where is everyone?

332
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,721
Heather!

333
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,932
Sally! Please. Please.

334
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:08,603
I don't know where
everyone is but the
ship's not deserted.

335
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:12,315
I mean, maybe some of
us think that it is
but it's not,

336
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:13,941
so let's just go
to the bridge.

337
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,361
We'll find the skipper
and then we'll go home.

338
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,404
I saw someone.

339
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,115
Fuck.

340
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,866
Wait.

341
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:31,209
[clank]

342
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:33,086
Hello?

343
00:28:52,271 --> 00:28:55,023
Did you see
who it was?
Was it Heather?

344
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:57,692
I didn't see.

345
00:28:57,778 --> 00:29:00,488
I'm sorry.

346
00:29:00,571 --> 00:29:02,030
(Downey)
Where're you going?

347
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:04,116
Why don't you
just help me out here?

348
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:05,910
What?

349
00:29:05,993 --> 00:29:07,744
Just wait for Vic.

350
00:29:11,165 --> 00:29:12,165
What?

351
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,250
It's fine.

352
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:14,876
Why can't we
go with him?

353
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:18,423
Let's just do as Greg
says and wait here
for Victor, okay?

354
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:19,589
Fine.

355
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:21,259
I think Victor's
in danger.

356
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:23,553
I'm not worried
about Victor.

357
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:26,638
I'm sorry I'm acting
weird. It's just I'm
having déjà vu

358
00:29:26,722 --> 00:29:28,348
every time
I turn a corner.

359
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,683
No, no. No.

360
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,227
I know this place.

361
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:33,729
No, you don't
know this place.
You're just in shock.

362
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:35,272
That's funny.

363
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:37,400
What is it?
What is it?
Is it Tommy?

364
00:29:37,483 --> 00:29:41,278
Is it guilt?
Is that what it is?
Do you feel guilty?

365
00:30:04,051 --> 00:30:06,136
Hello?

366
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,013
Hello.

367
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:13,703
[door bangs]

368
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:17,750
[clank]

369
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,556
Hello.

370
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:35,643
We're on the third floor.
The bridge is exactly
two floors above us.

371
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:39,063
Greg, that was blood.
Are you just gonna
ignore it?

372
00:31:39,146 --> 00:31:41,106
I know guys that work
on ships like this.

373
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:44,484
They see us, they get bored.
They're just letting off
some steam.

374
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:48,573
What? They rescue us
from the sea and then
they just hide for fun?

375
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:51,075
Yeah.

376
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,118
Well, what's
your theory?

377
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:55,663
I don't know,
but I'm not,
but I'm not in shock.

378
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,790
I'll be in the ball room.
I'm getting off this ship.

379
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:02,336
Jess, fuck! Don't you
see that this is all
just in your mind?

380
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:05,839
Jess! Ships don't
just magically appear
out of nowhere.

381
00:32:05,923 --> 00:32:10,510
They have skippers.
I mean, in your world
right now they don't.

382
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:19,060
My world is waiting
outside school for his
mother to pick him up.

383
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:22,315
Don't talk to me
about my world.

384
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:26,902
Jess. Jess, I'm sorry.

385
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,464
Is that blood?

386
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:54,221
Babe, come on, we're
supposed to meet them
in the theater.

387
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:56,682
Heather!

388
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:01,019
Oh, my God. Shit.

389
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:03,396
Sally. Sal, come on.

390
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,857
Let's just go
to the theater.

391
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,377
Downey, I can't see
anymore blood. I don't
think she's in here.

392
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:28,338
To be honest with you,
I don't think she's
even on the ship.

393
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,383
Okay. So whose
blood was that?

394
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,224
Hello?

395
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:44,646
Downey? Sally?

396
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:56,157
[door opens]

397
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,663
[thump]

398
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:20,266
Victor. What happened?

399
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:26,731
[groans]

400
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,300
Oh, my God.

401
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:58,262
[gunshot]

402
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:15,528
(Downey)
Stay with me, Greg.
Stay with me, man.

403
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:16,989
Stay with me, man.

404
00:35:17,072 --> 00:35:19,657
[cries]

405
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,911
No. No!

406
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:24,329
You fucking bitch!
You shot him!

407
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:25,414
What?

408
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,041
He said you shot him.

409
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,708
I didn't!

410
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:29,918
Fucking liar!

411
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:31,378
I wasn't even
with Greg!

412
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:35,548
He's dead!
He's dead!
Look!

413
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:37,425
God, you're a bitch!

414
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:42,764
[sobs]

415
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:45,726
Get your hands off him!

416
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:48,521
I didn't do it!
I was with Victor.

417
00:35:49,688 --> 00:35:51,065
Someone attacked him.

418
00:35:51,148 --> 00:35:52,900
Someone?

419
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:55,485
You think I did it?

420
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:58,072
Why did you tell us
to come to the theater?

421
00:35:58,155 --> 00:36:02,326
I didn't. I--
Sally, I didn't.

422
00:36:02,409 --> 00:36:03,911
I didn't.

423
00:36:03,994 --> 00:36:06,454
My God, you're
a fucking skitso.

424
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:07,706
[shouts]

425
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:09,916
Sally, no.

426
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,253
[shotgun]

427
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,380
[groans]

428
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:16,840
[groaning]

429
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:21,929
Sally!

430
00:36:22,012 --> 00:36:23,722
No!

431
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:28,936
Downey!
[cries]

432
00:36:29,019 --> 00:36:30,688
[shouts]

433
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:32,398
Let it go. Let it go.

434
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:34,315
[shouting]
No!

435
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:21,739
[clank]

436
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:43,612
[footsteps]

437
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,661
Don't shoot. Please.

438
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:57,083
Please, don't
shoot. Please.

439
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,670
I have a son.
I have a son.

440
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:24,360
Shit.

441
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:19,750
Who are you?
Tell me!

442
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:22,251
Who are you?

443
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:24,505
[babbles]

444
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:26,130
What the fuck
are you saying?

445
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:28,382
It's the only way
to get home.

446
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:29,967
What?

447
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:32,054
You have to kill them.

448
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:36,224
Kill them!
Kill them!
Kill them!

449
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:04,710
[distant squawking]

450
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,382
[squawking]

451
00:41:12,846 --> 00:41:16,806
[music played on
a scratched record]

452
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:56,304
[swing music]

453
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:28,211
[distant voices shouting]

454
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:45,853
Over here.
Come on. Hey!

455
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:50,858
(Sally)
Help us, please!

456
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:53,237
Help!

457
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:56,697
Hey. Hey.

458
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:58,492
Help us!

459
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,826
Please!

460
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:03,789
There, there. Over there.
I can see somebody.

461
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:05,958
(Sally)
Please!

462
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:09,001
[shouting continues]

463
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:21,556
[swing music]

464
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:41,909
(Victor)
Hello?

465
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,704
Looks like they decided
to scratch the welcome.

466
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:45,579
(Greg)
Let's go
to the bridge.

467
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:49,166
We'll get the captain
to put a call out to
the coast guard.

468
00:43:54,007 --> 00:43:55,882
Hello!

469
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:06,976
Hello?

470
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:18,112
(Victor)
Where the fuck
is everybody?

471
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,329
(Downey)
Do you even know
where we're going?

472
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:35,922
Well, we're just,
just walking for
the sake of it.

473
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,594
You all right?

474
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,264
I feel like
I know this place.

475
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:46,974
I recognize
this corridor.

476
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:50,519
Liners, they look
pretty similar.

477
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:53,148
No, that's not it.

478
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:56,735
Jess, come on.

479
00:44:56,818 --> 00:44:59,403
(Victor)
This is the same ship.
This thing's old.

480
00:44:59,489 --> 00:45:02,782
(Downey)
Yeah. 1932.

481
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:05,034
It is the same.
Here's where we boarded.

482
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:08,704
Yeah. Aeolus.

483
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:10,956
Aeolus.

484
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:14,168
Aeolus was the Greek
god of the winds and
the father of Sisyphus,

485
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:17,547
the man condemned by the gods
to the task of pushing a rock
up a mountain

486
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:19,465
only to have it
roll back down again.

487
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,717
That's a shitty
punishment. What
did he do?

488
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:25,429
He cheated Death.
No, he made a promise
to Death that he didn't keep.

489
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:28,682
I studied him and I
can't remember. Can we
just keep on moving?

490
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,481
Hello?

491
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:45,594
(Sally)
Heather?

492
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:48,472
(Victor)
Hello!

493
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,393
Heather!

494
00:46:55,605 --> 00:46:57,271
Heather!

495
00:46:57,356 --> 00:47:01,067
(Greg)
Sally. Please. I don't
know where everyone is.

496
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:02,735
But the ship's
not deserted.

497
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:06,239
I mean, maybe some of
us think that it is
but it's not,

498
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:07,782
so let's just go
to the bridge.

499
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:10,869
We'll find the skipper
and then we go home.

500
00:47:10,952 --> 00:47:13,329
(Jess)
I saw someone.

501
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:16,750
[squawking]

502
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:59,083
Hello?

503
00:48:05,967 --> 00:48:07,717
Hello.

504
00:48:18,144 --> 00:48:20,646
Shit. How did you
get here so fast?

505
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:24,275
Victor, you got, you
gotta listen to me. We
don't have much time.

506
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,985
Oh, what's going on?
Where's Greg?

507
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:27,112
He's dead.

508
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:28,487
What?

509
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:30,407
No, I mean,
he was dead.
He's not dead now.

510
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:31,907
What are you saying?

511
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:35,619
Downstairs right now
is a copy of myself.

512
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:38,706
Me, walking and
talking with Greg.

513
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:41,710
Right.

514
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:50,175
There.

515
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,719
There's birds.

516
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:53,597
No, that was
Downey's body.

517
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:56,641
I just left Downey
back there. How did
you get here so fast?

518
00:48:56,726 --> 00:48:59,101
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

519
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:04,773
[squawking]

520
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:13,282
No. Downey was there.
It was Downey's body.

521
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:18,246
There are bodies
all over this ship.

522
00:49:18,331 --> 00:49:22,208
Your body is on the floor
at the restaurant with
a hole in your head.

523
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:24,668
Listen, I'm gonna do
you a favor, okay?

524
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:26,880
I'm not gonna tell
anyone about this.

525
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:31,342
It's the truth.
Victor, we gotta get
off this ship right now.

526
00:49:31,427 --> 00:49:33,385
You're saying there's
two of you now.

527
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:35,054
Yes.

528
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:36,681
And I'm dead
in the restaurant.

529
00:49:36,766 --> 00:49:38,307
You were killed.

530
00:49:38,391 --> 00:49:42,144
Okay. So, I'm dead.
Downey's in the water.
He's dead, too.

531
00:49:42,228 --> 00:49:44,313
Is Sally okay?

532
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:46,858
See where I'm going
with this, right?

533
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,777
If we are dead and
there's two of you,

534
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,862
how are we all gonna
get off this ship?

535
00:49:50,945 --> 00:49:53,239
We should never have
boarded this ship.

536
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:55,032
I knew something
was wrong.

537
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:58,452
I should've forced you
to stay on the yacht
and you'd all be alive.

538
00:49:58,536 --> 00:50:00,664
I've gotta tell you
I feel pretty alive
right now.

539
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:04,918
Soon you're gonna be dead.
Everything that happened
to you, happened before.

540
00:50:05,001 --> 00:50:07,753
I can't even believe
I'm talking this shit.

541
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:11,298
You will die and then,
then Downey and Sally
and then Greg.

542
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:20,016
[groans]

543
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,353
[groans]

544
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,108
I didn't do this.
I didn't do it.

545
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:47,043
(Greg)
We're on the third level.

546
00:50:47,128 --> 00:50:50,380
Greg, that was blood.
You just gonna ignore it?

547
00:50:50,463 --> 00:50:52,423
I know guys that work
on ships like this.

548
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:55,385
They see us, they get bored.
They're just letting off
some steam.

549
00:51:05,938 --> 00:51:08,648
Don't you see that this
is all just in your mind?

550
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:11,275
Ships don't just
magically appear
out of nowhere.

551
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:14,862
They have skippers.
I mean, in your world
right now they don't.

552
00:51:14,947 --> 00:51:19,367
My world is waiting
outside school for his
mother to pick him up.

553
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,954
Don't talk to me
about my world.

554
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,884
[sobs]

555
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:37,885
(Jess)
Who are you?

556
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:43,224
Who are you?

557
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:41,657
[shouting]
Who are you?

558
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:43,742
Listen, listen to me.

559
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:46,036
Please, you have
to listen.

560
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,248
Kill them all.

561
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:52,460
If they board,
kill them.

562
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:56,922
Jess. Jess, you
gotta kill them.

563
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:59,217
Please, you have
to listen.

564
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:01,594
Don't let them board.

565
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:04,931
No, no. No.
Please, please.
Stop, stop them.

566
00:53:05,014 --> 00:53:07,266
If they board,
kill them.

567
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:09,726
Jess. Jess, you
gotta kill them.

568
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:11,646
If they board,
kill them.

569
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:15,650
No, no. No.
Please, please, stop.
If they board, kill them.

570
00:53:15,733 --> 00:53:18,987
Please, please stop.
Jess, Jess, Jess.

571
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:21,655
Fuck you!

572
00:53:32,001 --> 00:53:34,543
[sobs]

573
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,304
Shit.

574
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:35,771
Tommy.

575
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:50,911
(Sally)
Is that blood?

576
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:55,123
Babe, come on. We're
supposed to meet them
at the theater.

577
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:23,652
Victor.

578
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:29,617
I didn't mean
to hurt you.

579
00:55:29,702 --> 00:55:32,954
You know I didn't mean
to hurt you, right?

580
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:36,289
Now, I'm gonna try
and get us off
this ship, okay?

581
00:55:36,375 --> 00:55:38,083
(Jess)
Sally.

582
00:55:39,628 --> 00:55:41,586
Sally?

583
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:47,552
Sally?

584
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:05,570
Victor?

585
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:07,362
What happened?

586
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:25,213
You're not me.

587
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:43,315
[whispers]
You're not me.

588
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:17,266
You see?
I'm not crazy.

589
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:24,648
Victor.

590
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:28,527
This didn't happen
before. Don't you see?

591
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:31,197
You tried to
strangle me, remember?

592
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,782
Now, you gotta be strong.
I'm gonna get the others.

593
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:35,576
[gunshot]

594
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:41,706
Downey, do something.

595
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,376
Stay with me, man.

596
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,210
Do something.

597
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,711
I don't know
what to do.

598
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:49,465
Is he dead?
Is he dead?

599
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:52,300
Greg. Greg.

600
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:55,679
You fucking--

601
00:57:55,764 --> 00:57:58,349
Listen, I'm not gonna
hurt you. We don't
have much time.

602
00:57:58,432 --> 00:57:59,891
Don't you point
that thing.

603
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:01,643
Move!

604
00:58:02,478 --> 00:58:03,980
Go, go, go.

605
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,733
I hit her.
I think I hit her.

606
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:09,318
What's going on?
Who was that?

607
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:12,822
It's starting over again.
That's what's going on.

608
00:58:12,905 --> 00:58:14,072
Let's go.

609
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:15,699
We can't leave
without Greg.

610
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:18,411
We'll come back
for Greg. I promise.
Let's go, come on!

611
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:23,583
We can change
the pattern.
Don't you see?

612
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:27,420
We change the pattern,
we're not trapped. Then
we get off this thing.

613
00:58:27,503 --> 00:58:29,380
She's fucking mad.

614
00:58:29,463 --> 00:58:30,422
You think?

615
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:31,632
You have to
listen to me.

616
00:58:31,717 --> 00:58:33,134
No, I don't have
to listen to you.

617
00:58:33,217 --> 00:58:34,635
Was it me
that shot you?

618
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:36,219
I don't know.

619
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:38,764
Whoa, wait.
Could we just take
a breath for a second?

620
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:41,016
Okay, Jess, I am prepared
to listen to you

621
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:43,436
and even to believe
you, but you gotta
make some sense.

622
00:58:43,519 --> 00:58:47,231
I'm making perfect sense.
I'm gonna get Victor, then
we get off this ship.

623
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:49,983
Wait here.

624
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:53,820
And don't trust anyone.

625
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:56,407
If anyone comes,
you shoot them.

626
00:58:56,490 --> 00:58:57,949
What are you
talking about?

627
00:58:58,034 --> 00:58:59,367
You shoot them.

628
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:02,329
What?

629
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:12,923
[whispers]
Victor.

630
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:15,509
Victor?

631
00:59:39,451 --> 00:59:41,244
[gunshot]

632
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:46,791
I said who is it?

633
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:56,259
I said who is it?

634
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,398
It's me, Jess.

635
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:15,360
Jesus Christ, what
the fuck happened to you?

636
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,405
A long story.

637
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:22,367
Where's Victor?

638
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:24,077
He's dead.

639
01:00:25,871 --> 01:00:28,291
He fell over
the side.

640
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:31,918
How do we know
you didn't kill him?

641
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:33,628
You don't.

642
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:36,132
If you wanna live,
you'll follow me.

643
01:00:42,222 --> 01:00:43,306
Downey!

644
01:00:43,389 --> 01:00:45,224
Ignore it.

645
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:47,393
Downey!

646
01:00:47,476 --> 01:00:48,893
What's going on?

647
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:51,105
Is said ignore it.

648
01:00:51,188 --> 01:00:52,940
Where are you?
Call out.

649
01:00:53,025 --> 01:00:57,485
No, I'm not just
gonna ignore it.
What is going on?

650
01:00:57,570 --> 01:00:59,362
[whispers]
Where the fuck
are you?

651
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:03,034
Call out!
You're in danger.
You're in danger.

652
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:05,536
Who is that?

653
01:01:05,619 --> 01:01:07,621
Not who you think?

654
01:01:15,005 --> 01:01:17,672
So, what are we
doing in here?

655
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:21,135
[shouts]

656
01:01:38,987 --> 01:01:40,653
(Jess)
Sally!

657
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:42,447
Wait!

658
01:01:53,293 --> 01:01:55,001
I'm sorry but
I love my son.

659
01:01:56,088 --> 01:01:58,088
[groans]

660
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:01,007
Sally?

661
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:03,135
That wasn't me.

662
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:08,056
Sally?

663
01:02:28,577 --> 01:02:30,329
[door opens]

664
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:39,797
Sally?

665
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:07,490
Hello? Hello?

666
01:03:07,576 --> 01:03:09,909
Please, can
you hear me?

667
01:03:09,994 --> 01:03:12,413
Help me.
Please, help me.

668
01:03:12,496 --> 01:03:14,164
She's killing everyone.

669
01:03:14,248 --> 01:03:17,543
They're dead.
They're all dead.
Please--

670
01:03:17,626 --> 01:03:19,378
Sally?

671
01:03:19,463 --> 01:03:22,380
What's your
position? Over.

672
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:29,179
Sally.

673
01:03:29,264 --> 01:03:32,557
Distressed caller,
we hear you. What are
your coordinates? Over.

674
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:39,063
Coast guard, did you hear
a distress call? We're not
getting in anymore. Over.

675
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:41,900
Greg.

676
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:44,527
Greg, is that you?

677
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:46,780
[interference]

678
01:03:48,909 --> 01:03:52,786
Distressed caller, make
another transmission.
What is your position?

679
01:03:52,871 --> 01:03:55,121
Greg, can you
hear me? Greg.

680
01:03:55,206 --> 01:03:57,875
[interference]

681
01:03:57,958 --> 01:03:59,626
Shit.

682
01:04:08,887 --> 01:04:10,637
Sally?

683
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:18,686
Sally?

684
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:24,025
[Sally groans]

685
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:26,695
[crying]

686
01:05:13,076 --> 01:05:15,286
Oh, my God, what
happened to you?

687
01:05:15,369 --> 01:05:18,414
Get away from me.

688
01:05:18,498 --> 01:05:21,958
It wasn't me, Sally.
I didn't do this to you.

689
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:27,880
[whispers]
It wasn't me.
Where is Downey?

690
01:05:27,965 --> 01:05:30,634
I don't know
where he is.

691
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:32,052
You killed him.

692
01:05:32,137 --> 01:05:34,554
What?

693
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:38,016
No, I didn't.
I didn't kill him.

694
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:39,226
What?

695
01:05:39,311 --> 01:05:40,561
I swear.

696
01:05:40,644 --> 01:05:42,688
You're crazy.

697
01:05:42,771 --> 01:05:44,815
Why are you
doing this?

698
01:05:44,898 --> 01:05:47,693
Sally, I know it's hard
but you gotta trust me.

699
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:50,153
Gotta trust me, okay?

700
01:06:17,474 --> 01:06:19,516
Listen, you
gotta hold on.

701
01:06:19,601 --> 01:06:21,101
I think it will
return again.

702
01:06:21,186 --> 01:06:25,230
The yacht, the Triangle,
I think it'll come back.

703
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:28,233
If it does, we'll escape,
me and you together.

704
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:31,110
We'll re-board it
and escape.

705
01:06:32,197 --> 01:06:34,489
Please.

706
01:06:37,534 --> 01:06:39,869
Don't hurt me.

707
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:42,331
Sally, I'm not
gonna hurt you.

708
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,168
If you hold on,

709
01:06:46,251 --> 01:06:48,878
you can see
Downey again.

710
01:07:06,898 --> 01:07:10,025
[squawking]

711
01:07:12,277 --> 01:07:16,114
[voices shouting]

712
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:19,909
Hey, come on.
Over here.

713
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:23,204
Hey. Hey. Help.

714
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:25,916
It returns when
they're dead.

715
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:34,007
It returns when
everyone's dead.

716
01:07:48,188 --> 01:07:50,523
Do you think Heather
would've made it
on board?

717
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:51,817
Honey.

718
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:53,485
There's a chance,
isn't there?

719
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:55,528
Yeah. Yeah,
there's a chance.

720
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:49,373
Stop this thing.

721
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:51,542
Stop this fucking thing.

722
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:13,981
Please.

723
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:16,443
I wanna go home.

724
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:20,738
I wanna go home.

725
01:09:46,807 --> 01:09:50,435
He's dead.
I mean, he
was dead.

726
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,645
He's not dead now.

727
01:09:52,729 --> 01:09:55,023
I was hiding and I saw
this version of myself,

728
01:09:55,108 --> 01:09:58,902
and she had blood
on her face, and
then I killed her.

729
01:09:58,987 --> 01:10:00,779
I killed her on
the front of the ship.

730
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:02,780
Listen, I'm gonna
do you a favor, okay?

731
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:05,074
I'm not gonna tell
anyone about this.

732
01:10:05,158 --> 01:10:07,077
It's the truth.
You gotta listen to me.

733
01:10:07,161 --> 01:10:09,453
No, I'm not listening
to another word you say.

734
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:13,375
You will die, and then
Greg and then Downey.

735
01:10:19,923 --> 01:10:22,050
[footsteps]

736
01:10:33,438 --> 01:10:35,646
[groans]

737
01:10:43,363 --> 01:10:47,033
Don't be scared, Victor.
I can save you.

738
01:10:48,953 --> 01:10:51,454
I know how to save you.

739
01:12:06,405 --> 01:12:08,239
You should try
and eat, babe.

740
01:12:11,202 --> 01:12:13,161
Jess?

741
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:27,134
Jesus, what
happened to you?

742
01:12:27,217 --> 01:12:28,760
Where's Greg?

743
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:31,430
Greg told me to tell you
we should meet in
the theater.

744
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:34,224
There's a theater?

745
01:12:34,307 --> 01:12:36,935
Yes, it's just
that way.

746
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:38,520
Where are you going?

747
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:40,271
I'll see you there.

748
01:12:40,355 --> 01:12:43,649
Okay, she's really
starting to freak
me out now.

749
01:13:21,146 --> 01:13:23,481
Don't you see that this
is all just in your mind?

750
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:27,527
Ships don't just magically
appear out of nowhere.
They have skippers.

751
01:13:27,612 --> 01:13:29,654
In your world
right now maybe
they don't.

752
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:34,826
My world is waiting
outside school for his
mother to pick him up.

753
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:37,787
Don't talk to me
about my world.

754
01:13:38,538 --> 01:13:40,957
Jess.

755
01:13:41,042 --> 01:13:42,876
Jess, I'm sorry.

756
01:14:19,663 --> 01:14:21,914
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

757
01:14:21,998 --> 01:14:23,958
Okay.

758
01:14:24,042 --> 01:14:26,711
Take it easy, man.

759
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:28,796
Just take it easy.

760
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:34,636
What did we do?
We're not part
of this boat.

761
01:14:34,761 --> 01:14:38,305
We just got here, okay?
We've been walking around.
There's no one on it.

762
01:14:38,390 --> 01:14:41,600
I can go right
now. I will go.

763
01:14:41,685 --> 01:14:45,104
Okay? Just--
Just take it easy.

764
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:47,064
Take it easy.

765
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:48,899
Okay?

766
01:14:54,489 --> 01:14:56,740
Jess?

767
01:14:57,659 --> 01:14:59,911
Jess.

768
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:01,371
Jess, what
are you doing?

769
01:15:01,454 --> 01:15:05,917
Wha--what is this?
Why--what are
you wearing?

770
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:08,002
I don't want you
to see my face.

771
01:15:08,087 --> 01:15:09,628
Why?

772
01:15:09,713 --> 01:15:12,047
Because this
is not me.

773
01:15:12,132 --> 01:15:15,844
I'm somewhere out there
in the yacht and
you're with me.

774
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:20,806
And after I kill you,
we'll return.

775
01:15:20,891 --> 01:15:23,059
Is that right?

776
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:28,064
You know, why-why
don't you just put
down the gun first?

777
01:15:28,149 --> 01:15:30,859
Okay? Come on.

778
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:33,444
You see, the boat
comes back when
you're all dead.

779
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:35,697
I've done everything
exactly like before.

780
01:15:35,780 --> 01:15:38,617
But when the boat
comes back, I'll be
ready, I'll be waiting.

781
01:15:38,701 --> 01:15:43,078
I'll be on the landing bay.
I won't let any of them
board, even the other me.

782
01:15:43,163 --> 01:15:45,497
I'll make them all stay
on the upturned yacht.

783
01:15:45,582 --> 01:15:46,832
Okay.

784
01:15:46,917 --> 01:15:50,921
Jess, we'll do
whatever you want.

785
01:15:51,005 --> 01:15:54,381
Okay? Just, just
put down the gun.

786
01:15:57,261 --> 01:15:58,302
Come on.

787
01:15:58,386 --> 01:15:59,887
I'm so sorry.

788
01:15:59,971 --> 01:16:01,555
No, no, no, no!

789
01:16:03,684 --> 01:16:05,351
[Sally shouting]
Greg!

790
01:16:05,435 --> 01:16:07,270
Oh, God!
What happened?

791
01:16:07,354 --> 01:16:09,064
It was Jess.

792
01:16:09,148 --> 01:16:12,859
You fucking bitch!
You shot him. He
said you shot him.

793
01:16:12,944 --> 01:16:14,402
I wasn't even
with Greg!

794
01:16:14,487 --> 01:16:16,654
He's dead!
He's dead!

795
01:16:18,365 --> 01:16:20,951
My God, you're a
fucking skitso.

796
01:16:21,034 --> 01:16:23,328
[shouting]

797
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:25,497
Downey!

798
01:16:26,748 --> 01:16:28,416
[shouts]

799
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:41,948
Please.

800
01:17:43,326 --> 01:17:44,743
Don't kill me.

801
01:17:44,827 --> 01:17:47,328
I have a son.

802
01:17:47,412 --> 01:17:49,331
I have a son.

803
01:19:09,078 --> 01:19:10,828
Who are you?

804
01:19:11,788 --> 01:19:12,831
Tell me!

805
01:19:12,914 --> 01:19:14,498
They'll return.

806
01:19:14,582 --> 01:19:16,333
Who are you?

807
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:18,920
They'll return.
You have to kill them.

808
01:19:19,003 --> 01:19:20,505
It's the only way
to get home.

809
01:19:20,588 --> 01:19:22,047
What the fuck
are you saying?

810
01:19:22,132 --> 01:19:24,676
It's the only way
to save our son.

811
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,176
You have to kill them.

812
01:19:26,261 --> 01:19:28,637
Kill them?
Kill them?

813
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:57,220
Hurry up, Sweetheart.
We're gonna be late.

814
01:23:32,548 --> 01:23:34,132
What's fun in
buying you things

815
01:23:34,217 --> 01:23:36,719
if you're gonna leave
them in the fucking garden!

816
01:23:36,804 --> 01:23:38,887
I'm sick of telling
you this, Tommy.

817
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:43,100
I ain't buying you anymore
toys if you can't look after
the ones you've got.

818
01:23:48,606 --> 01:23:51,024
Now what?

819
01:23:54,404 --> 01:23:56,154
Oh, I'll just
clean it up, shall I?

820
01:23:59,952 --> 01:24:02,119
Yeah, I'm just cleaning
the fucking mess!

821
01:24:02,203 --> 01:24:08,751
What's the matter
with you, huh? What's
the matter with you?

822
01:24:08,836 --> 01:24:12,880
Just one day off
is all I ask. Just
one fucking day off!

823
01:24:15,384 --> 01:24:18,636
I don't know why you
can't paint a picture
like a normal kid.

824
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:21,180
You get this
from your father.

825
01:24:21,265 --> 01:24:23,515
He was an asshole, too.

826
01:24:37,948 --> 01:24:39,573
Shit.

827
01:24:51,336 --> 01:24:53,128
Jack?

828
01:24:53,212 --> 01:24:55,756
Did you see anyone
ring my doorbell?

829
01:25:32,836 --> 01:25:34,420
Tommy?

830
01:25:35,881 --> 01:25:37,672
Sweetheart, come here.

831
01:25:37,757 --> 01:25:41,385
Come here.
Come here!
It's okay.

832
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:44,471
[cries]

833
01:25:48,476 --> 01:25:50,811
Mommy's fine,
you see?

834
01:25:52,439 --> 01:25:54,189
Mommy's fine.

835
01:25:57,069 --> 01:25:59,779
You're just having
a bad dream. That's
all, baby.

836
01:25:59,863 --> 01:26:02,698
It's all it was.

837
01:26:02,783 --> 01:26:06,077
Bad dreams make you
think you've seen
things that you haven't.

838
01:26:52,373 --> 01:26:54,708
Things are gonna be
different now, Tommy.

839
01:26:56,502 --> 01:26:58,962
Mommy won't lose
her temper anymore,

840
01:26:59,046 --> 01:27:01,215
even when you
do things wrong.

841
01:27:02,551 --> 01:27:04,467
And she won't hurt you.

842
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:07,805
I know she
won't hurt you.

843
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:11,225
You know how
I know that, Tommy?

844
01:27:11,310 --> 01:27:15,145
Because that woman that
did those things to you
is not Mommy.

845
01:27:15,229 --> 01:27:18,315
This is Mommy.
Mommy's nice.

846
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:19,900
Shit.

847
01:27:23,947 --> 01:27:26,114
Shit.

848
01:27:37,461 --> 01:27:39,462
[Tommy cries]

849
01:27:39,546 --> 01:27:41,713
Tommy, stay in the car.

850
01:27:41,797 --> 01:27:43,925
I'm gonna
bury it, okay?

851
01:28:00,567 --> 01:28:03,069
[pants]

852
01:28:45,444 --> 01:28:48,154
We have to go.
We have to get
out of here.

853
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:54,912
Stop screaming, babe.

854
01:28:54,997 --> 01:28:57,789
Please, Tommy,
is just blood.

855
01:28:57,873 --> 01:28:59,708
Stop screaming!

856
01:28:59,792 --> 01:29:02,502
Tommy, look. See?
There, it's gone.

857
01:29:02,587 --> 01:29:04,880
See? There. It's gone.

858
01:30:34,595 --> 01:30:36,805
Are you all right?

859
01:30:42,311 --> 01:30:44,188
Who are you?

860
01:30:44,271 --> 01:30:45,980
Just a driver.

861
01:30:52,863 --> 01:30:56,324
No point trying
to save the boy.

862
01:30:56,408 --> 01:30:59,369
There's nothing anyone
can do that's gonna
bring him back.

863
01:31:02,998 --> 01:31:04,917
Can I give you a ride?

864
01:31:09,631 --> 01:31:11,715
Yes.

865
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:14,510
Take me to the harbor.

866
01:31:36,824 --> 01:31:38,617
Hey.

867
01:31:43,789 --> 01:31:46,167
I'll leave
the meter running.

868
01:31:52,131 --> 01:31:54,632
You will come
back, won't you?

869
01:31:57,011 --> 01:32:00,096
Yes, I-I promise.

870
01:32:08,606 --> 01:32:11,192
[squawking]

871
01:32:20,784 --> 01:32:22,036
Jess.

872
01:32:26,498 --> 01:32:28,208
Do you know me?

873
01:32:28,292 --> 01:32:31,878
I feel like I do.
Greg talks about
you enough.

874
01:32:33,881 --> 01:32:35,632
Where is Greg?

875
01:32:35,716 --> 01:32:37,717
Where do you think?

876
01:32:37,801 --> 01:32:39,761
Come on, you're late.

877
01:32:39,845 --> 01:32:41,930
You're the one
with the kid, right?

878
01:32:42,015 --> 01:32:44,641
Yeah.

879
01:32:44,725 --> 01:32:46,851
How come you didn't
bring him along?

880
01:32:53,859 --> 01:32:56,904
He's at school.

881
01:32:56,988 --> 01:32:59,573
You sure about that?

882
01:32:59,658 --> 01:33:01,492
Yes.

883
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:12,836
Are you okay?

884
01:33:12,921 --> 01:33:15,546
I don't think so.

885
01:33:15,631 --> 01:33:18,091
Hey, what's the matter?
What happened?

886
01:33:21,387 --> 01:33:22,845
Hey.

887
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:24,600
I'm sorry.

888
01:33:24,685 --> 01:33:28,850
You have nothing
to apologize for.
What's the matter?

889
01:33:28,935 --> 01:33:30,854
I'm just tired.

890
01:33:30,939 --> 01:33:33,604
Listen, we don't
have to go today if
you don't want to.

891
01:33:33,689 --> 01:33:36,359
No, I do.
I-I wanna go.

892
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:38,734
Are you sure?

893
01:33:44,369 --> 01:33:46,329
[whispers]
Yeah.

894
01:33:46,414 --> 01:33:48,494
Yeah? Come,
come here.

895
01:33:54,630 --> 01:33:58,050
This is Sally and
her husband, Downey.

896
01:33:58,135 --> 01:34:00,885
This is Heather,
Sally's friend. You
remember Victor.

897
01:34:00,970 --> 01:34:02,760
Let's go sailing.

898
01:34:02,845 --> 01:34:04,805
Okay.
