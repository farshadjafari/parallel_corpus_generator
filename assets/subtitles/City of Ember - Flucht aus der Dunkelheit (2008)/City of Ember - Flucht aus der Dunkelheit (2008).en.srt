1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:50,492
Sazu489...

1
00:00:50,492 --> 00:00:52,426
<i>On the day the world ended...</i>

2
00:00:52,494 --> 00:00:57,830
<i>the fate of mankind was carried</i>
<i>in a small metal box.</i>

3
00:01:07,309 --> 00:01:11,905
<i>In a secret location, architects,</i>
<i>scientists and engineers met...</i>

4
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,438
<i>and concluded that there was</i>
<i>only one hope for our future:</i>

5
00:01:17,085 --> 00:01:19,883
<i>To build an underground city...</i>

6
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:23,686
<i>designed to keep its citizens
protected for generations to come.</i>

7
00:01:35,504 --> 00:01:38,007
Secure the box.

8
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,007
Set it for
200 years.

9
00:01:40,108 --> 00:01:43,441
We'll keep them in the city for 200 years.

10
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,080
You're certain
that'll be long enough?

11
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:51,051
None of us can be certain of anything.
We can hope.

12
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,112
<i>Growing up with no knowledge</i>
<i>of a world outside...</i>

13
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:59,854
future generations will be spared sorrow
for what they've lost.

14
00:02:05,033 --> 00:02:09,902
For the good of all mankind.

15
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:16,143
<i>The box was entrusted to the first mayor...</i>

16
00:02:16,211 --> 00:02:18,475
<i>who was to pass it on</i>
<i>to her successor.</i>

17
00:02:26,087 --> 00:02:28,021
<i>As the years counted down...</i>

18
00:02:28,089 --> 00:02:31,490
<i>the box passed from mayor to mayor.</i>

19
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,755
<i>None knew what secrets it held...</i>

20
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:37,060
<i>only that it would open</i>
<i>when it was needed most.</i>

21
00:02:40,101 --> 00:02:42,934
<i>But fate ran another course...</i>

22
00:02:44,005 --> 00:02:46,599
<i>and the chain was broken.</i>

23
00:02:55,584 --> 00:02:59,315
<i>The box was tucked away</i>
<i>and forgotten...</i>

24
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:02,379
<i>- and as the city grew old and began to crumble...</i>

25
00:03:02,457 --> 00:03:07,087
<i>the box quietly clicked open.</i>

26
00:03:54,743 --> 00:03:58,611
- Dad, do you hear that?
- Uh, hurry up. You don't wanna be late.

27
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,672
- I am hurrying.
<i>- I'm proud of you, Son.</i>

28
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,082
- Today's a big day.
- Yeah.

29
00:04:04,152 --> 00:04:07,918
I just hope I don't get assigned
some useless job.

30
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:11,049
<i>You can't control what job you get on</i>
<i>Assignment Day. That's not the point.</i>

31
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:14,721
The important thing is to do-

32
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,230
your part.

33
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:22,931
One, two, three, four...

34
00:04:23,004 --> 00:04:27,998
five, six, seven, eight-

35
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,748
They're getting longer.

36
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,808
- That one was.
<i>- Yeah, and it's the third one this week.</i>

37
00:04:37,886 --> 00:04:39,945
The Generator's
our only source of power.

38
00:04:40,021 --> 00:04:42,046
<i>- All Electricians and Wiremen-</i>
- If it goes-

39
00:04:42,123 --> 00:04:44,148
<i>- are advised to report to their stations.</i>
- we all go.

40
00:04:44,225 --> 00:04:47,956
- That's dramatic.
- Dad, this place is falling apart.

41
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:52,261
No, I will not just sit around
while Ember collapses.

42
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:55,098
I'm getting into that Generator,
whatever it takes.

43
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:26,959
Congratulations...

44
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:30,869
on achieving
this momentous occasion:

45
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:34,102
your Assignment Day.

46
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,938
I'm late!

47
00:05:40,015 --> 00:05:42,506
- Lina, are you and your granny all right?
- Yeah, we're fine.

48
00:05:42,584 --> 00:05:45,246
- You all right, Mr. Tock?
- Just another blackout, Lina.

49
00:05:46,521 --> 00:05:48,318
Hi.

50
00:05:57,198 --> 00:05:58,995
<i>Be you eight or 18, the time has come...</i>

51
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,365
<i>- to answer the call to service.</i>
- Hi, Mr. Boaz.

52
00:06:01,436 --> 00:06:04,462
- Stop!
- Produce the Book Of The City Of Ember.

53
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:09,639
- You need to sign in!
- I'm late!

54
00:06:25,126 --> 00:06:27,060
Psst! Lizzie.

55
00:06:29,898 --> 00:06:33,766
<i>- We swear-</i>
- Eternal loyalty to our city.

56
00:06:33,835 --> 00:06:37,100
We declare our infinite gratitude
to the Builders...

57
00:06:37,172 --> 00:06:39,106
who chose this site
with the greatest care.

58
00:06:39,174 --> 00:06:42,109
We flourish above
our mighty flowing river.

59
00:06:42,177 --> 00:06:46,443
We thrive thanks to the unbounded
capacity of our mighty Generator...

60
00:06:46,514 --> 00:06:49,449
beating at our very center
like a magnificent heart.

61
00:06:49,517 --> 00:06:54,079
Beyond Ember, the darkness
goes on forever in all directions.

62
00:06:54,155 --> 00:06:57,124
Ours is the only light in a dark world.

63
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,851
It's true.

64
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,738
Bag.

65
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:26,952
Be the first to discover your future.

66
00:07:29,224 --> 00:07:31,385
Reach in, young man.

67
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:37,488
Read it aloud.

68
00:07:37,565 --> 00:07:40,466
Electrician's Helper.

69
00:07:41,536 --> 00:07:43,663
I get to work in the Generator.

70
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,801
<i>Timekeeper's Assistant.</i>

71
00:07:47,876 --> 00:07:49,810
<i>You get to work with clocks.</i>

72
00:07:53,414 --> 00:07:56,850
- Building Repair Assistant.
<i>- They have a lot of fun.</i>

73
00:07:59,053 --> 00:08:01,385
- Greenhouse Helper.
<i>- That-a girl.</i>

74
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:06,088
- Potato Peeler.
<i>- You're gonna come in handy.</i>

75
00:08:12,934 --> 00:08:15,562
- Warehouse Clerk.
- A vital job.

76
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,868
Pick one, young lady.

77
00:08:36,457 --> 00:08:38,618
Pipeworks?

78
00:08:38,693 --> 00:08:41,787
Louder, so we can all hear.

79
00:08:43,598 --> 00:08:45,623
I'm a Pipeworks Laborer.

80
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,158
You're a very fortunate girl.
That is an important job.

81
00:08:58,446 --> 00:09:02,439
- Mold Scraper.
- We got a Mold Scraper. Great.

82
00:09:12,393 --> 00:09:16,022
Messenger.

83
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:24,166
<i>- I picked a dull job, but compared to yours-</i>
- Lina.

84
00:09:24,239 --> 00:09:25,866
<i>- mine's a shining light bulb.</i>
<i>- Lina.</i>

85
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,840
- Scream if you need me.
- Trade with me.

86
00:09:27,909 --> 00:09:30,707
- What?
- Swap jobs. Please. You have to.

87
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:33,246
You want to work in the Pipeworks?

88
00:09:33,314 --> 00:09:37,011
I want to be Electrician's Helper and work
in the Generator, but Joss won't swap.

89
00:09:37,085 --> 00:09:38,950
I would rather die
than be a Messenger.

90
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,386
- I don't want to waste my time while the whole city crumble-
- Yes.

91
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:45,119
- What?
- Yes.

92
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,025
- Thank you, Doon!
- Thanks!

93
00:10:01,442 --> 00:10:04,605
<i>#The light from the lamp is not all #</i>

94
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:08,615
- #There is a brighter light ##
- Mrs. Murdo!

95
00:10:08,683 --> 00:10:11,743
- How was your Assignment Day?
- I'm a Messenger!

96
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:15,482
That's wonderful, Lina!
Congratulations!

97
00:10:17,225 --> 00:10:19,056
Granny!

98
00:10:20,028 --> 00:10:22,428
Granny! Where are you?

99
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:26,399
I'm a Messenger.

100
00:10:26,467 --> 00:10:30,426
You shouldn't make things up.
You-You're not a Messenger, Lina.

101
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,564
But today was Assignment Day,
remember?

102
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,632
Oh.

103
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:38,804
- Where's Poppy?
- Poppy?

104
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,476
- Poppy?
- She was helping me look for something.

105
00:10:43,551 --> 00:10:45,746
I- Here's Poppy.

106
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,324
Poppy.

107
00:10:52,327 --> 00:10:54,761
<i>Poppy.</i>

108
00:10:54,829 --> 00:10:57,855
Poppy, take that out of your mouth.

109
00:10:59,334 --> 00:11:01,859
Here.

110
00:11:01,936 --> 00:11:04,427
- It's for you.
- Thank you.

111
00:11:13,915 --> 00:11:16,941
- I made it.
- Yeah, I can tell.

112
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:23,013
- Uh, what's it for?
- It's for your graduation.

113
00:11:23,091 --> 00:11:26,788
I mean, what does it do?

114
00:11:26,861 --> 00:11:28,829
You'll figure it out.

115
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,666
There's more to a bottle cap than
keeping liquid from leaking out of glass.

116
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:41,402
The main thing is, pay attention.

117
00:11:41,476 --> 00:11:45,071
Pay close attention to everything-
everything you see.

118
00:11:45,146 --> 00:11:47,876
<i>Notice what no one else notices...</i>

119
00:11:47,949 --> 00:11:50,975
and you'll know
what no one else knows.

120
00:11:51,052 --> 00:11:54,818
<i>What you get is what you get.</i>

121
00:11:56,657 --> 00:11:58,420
What you do with what you get-

122
00:11:58,493 --> 00:12:01,257
<i>That's more the point.</i>

123
00:12:01,329 --> 00:12:04,230
Wouldn't you say?

124
00:12:04,298 --> 00:12:06,664
Really useful, Dad.

125
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,834
Don't you want to eat?

126
00:12:11,906 --> 00:12:14,170
I'm not hungry.

127
00:12:16,144 --> 00:12:19,045
<i>I mean, we'll have to replace those.</i>

128
00:12:33,327 --> 00:12:35,454
Hey.

129
00:12:37,598 --> 00:12:39,463
Shh, shh, shh, shh. Hey, it's okay.

130
00:12:39,534 --> 00:12:41,468
You hurt your wing.

131
00:12:44,405 --> 00:12:46,430
Hmm.

132
00:12:55,616 --> 00:12:58,779
- Good night, Lina.
- Good night, Poppy.

133
00:13:00,221 --> 00:13:03,315
I'll play you the voices
while you fall asleep, okay?

134
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:14,430
Yoo-hoo.

135
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,470
<i>Yoo-hoo.</i>

136
00:13:18,406 --> 00:13:20,966
Anybody home?

137
00:13:21,042 --> 00:13:23,272
<i>Don't hold dinner for me, darling.</i>

138
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:26,108
<i>I'll be there before lights out.</i>

139
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,911
<i>Mrs. Mayfleet, your shoes are ready.</i>

140
00:13:29,984 --> 00:13:34,580
Hi, Raine. It's Clary.

141
00:13:34,655 --> 00:13:38,523
The sprinkler system's down
again in number two.

142
00:13:38,593 --> 00:13:42,996
Raine, it's me, Barrow.

143
00:13:43,064 --> 00:13:45,294
I've been thinking about it.

144
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,527
I watch my boy and...

145
00:13:48,603 --> 00:13:52,004
<i>I've come around.</i>
<i>I've changed my mind.</i>

146
00:13:52,073 --> 00:13:54,098
<i>I'm in.</i>

147
00:13:56,677 --> 00:13:58,474
<i>Where do you go?</i>

148
00:14:47,995 --> 00:14:49,929
Lina Mayfleet, reporting for duty!

149
00:14:53,668 --> 00:14:56,228
You're early, Mayfleet.

150
00:14:57,238 --> 00:14:59,229
At ease. At ease.

151
00:15:23,931 --> 00:15:25,899
8:00!

152
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,868
Stations, everybody!

153
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:47,886
- It's beautiful.
- Wear it proudly.

154
00:15:47,955 --> 00:15:51,721
Take care of it.
Always keep it in good repair.

155
00:15:51,792 --> 00:15:53,783
I will.

156
00:15:55,363 --> 00:15:57,490
Your station is Garn Square.

157
00:15:57,565 --> 00:16:00,261
Stop!

158
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:04,065
I need to tell you the rules.

159
00:16:04,138 --> 00:16:06,129
One: When a customer-

160
00:16:06,207 --> 00:16:08,607
Gives you a message, repeat it back
to make sure you've got it right.

161
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,577
Two: Always wear the red cape
so people can identify you.

162
00:16:11,646 --> 00:16:14,171
<i>Three: Our customers pay</i>
<i>20 coins for every message...</i>

163
00:16:14,248 --> 00:16:17,046
no matter how far we have
to carry it, so go fast.

164
00:16:17,118 --> 00:16:19,086
I love going fast.

165
00:16:19,153 --> 00:16:21,678
Very good. I'm impressed.

166
00:16:21,756 --> 00:16:23,690
Now go!

167
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:31,490
Sit. Sit.

168
00:16:31,565 --> 00:16:35,501
These overalls will go
over your clothes.

169
00:16:35,569 --> 00:16:38,538
That belt will have
all the tools you'll need.

170
00:16:38,606 --> 00:16:41,473
And I think there's enough traction
left in these boots.

171
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,171
You need traction to work the pipes.

172
00:16:45,246 --> 00:16:47,441
- Thank you.
<i>- Now, this locker is yours.</i>

173
00:16:47,515 --> 00:16:51,007
You can put in your shoes
and whatnots.

174
00:16:51,085 --> 00:16:53,519
- All right?
- Okay.

175
00:16:53,587 --> 00:16:56,613
All right. Try this.

176
00:16:59,193 --> 00:17:01,957
You've got a big head.

177
00:17:02,963 --> 00:17:04,828
Try this one.

178
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:06,833
Oh, that fits.

179
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:10,496
All right, now.
Cut your name in there.

180
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,732
- Why?
- Why?

181
00:17:12,807 --> 00:17:15,469
In case something happens to ya.

182
00:17:15,543 --> 00:17:19,479
The guy who wore this helmet
before you drowned.

183
00:17:19,547 --> 00:17:23,574
If he hadn't cut his name in there,
we wouldn't have known who he was.

184
00:17:24,652 --> 00:17:26,677
Here. Use this.

185
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,995
I think I can figure out what's wrong
with the Generator.

186
00:17:37,064 --> 00:17:39,931
When can I see it? Hmm?

187
00:17:41,001 --> 00:17:44,630
Done.


188
00:17:44,705 --> 00:17:47,037
Sul?

189
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:01,419
Twenty coins, please.

190
00:18:11,332 --> 00:18:13,596
Hey, slow down.

191
00:18:20,608 --> 00:18:22,405
Clary!

192
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,609
<i>Clary! It's me.</i>

193
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,875
Look at you.

194
00:18:28,949 --> 00:18:31,042
<i>- Roner told me.</i>
- You're my first message.

195
00:18:31,118 --> 00:18:33,245
That's great. I'm ready.

196
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,220
From Arbin Swinn,
the vegetable vendor.

197
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:37,450
Let me have it.

198
00:18:40,194 --> 00:18:43,994
"If this is a potato,
then I'm 16 and sexy."

199
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:51,304
<i>Help!</i>

200
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:10,957
<i>Stay back.</i>

201
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:13,516
<i>He could be contaminated.</i>
<i>He's been in the Unknown Region.</i>

202
00:19:13,594 --> 00:19:15,528
<i>Don't go near 'im.</i>

203
00:19:15,596 --> 00:19:19,464
I couldn't see it, but I ran right into it.
I swear. It was as big as a house.

204
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,798
I was just trying to get out
along the river.

205
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,839
It was so dark.
I grabbed onto it.

206
00:19:25,906 --> 00:19:28,374
- I had to, before it grabbed me!
<i>- Don't touch him!</i>

207
00:19:28,442 --> 00:19:32,469
Stand back! Back!

208
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,946
I had to! No! Ow!

209
00:19:35,015 --> 00:19:39,850
I knew it was dark,
but I had no idea how dark.

210
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,287
I couldn't see anything.

211
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,990
Why would he risk being thrown in jail-

212
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:51,327
when everyone knows
it's against the law to go out there?

213
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,963
<i> Come on, move!</i>

214
00:19:53,964 --> 00:19:56,529
There's far too much to do
here to worry about out there.

215
00:19:58,606 --> 00:20:02,042
Your father would have known
how to fix these potatoes.

216
00:20:05,145 --> 00:20:07,511
Don't dig too deep, Lina.

217
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:25,387
<i>- The whole thing is rusted.</i>
- Yep.

218
00:20:25,466 --> 00:20:27,491
- You know, it ought to be replaced, Sul.
- Yep.

219
00:20:27,568 --> 00:20:31,766
- So where do you store new pipe?
- New pipe?

220
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,570
We haven't had new pipe...

221
00:20:35,643 --> 00:20:38,077
since my second decade here.

222
00:20:38,145 --> 00:20:40,079
Yeah.

223
00:20:40,147 --> 00:20:42,741
We've been patchin' so long,
we have more patches than pipe.

224
00:20:42,816 --> 00:20:44,750
Here, hold that.

225
00:20:44,818 --> 00:20:46,911
Attaboy. That's good.

226
00:20:46,987 --> 00:20:50,218
Round and round we go. There.

227
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,225
All right, we'll check it.

228
00:20:53,327 --> 00:20:55,693
Squeeze it.

229
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,234
Is it holdin'?

230
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:03,770
Uh, so far.

231
00:21:03,837 --> 00:21:08,297
So far? So far is so good.

232
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,309
Oh.

233
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,838
- W-What's gonna happen?
- Same as always.

234
00:21:14,915 --> 00:21:16,712
- What's that?
- We'll cope.

235
00:21:16,784 --> 00:21:18,581
But what about the blackouts?
They're getting worse.

236
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,552
- They're-They're-They're-
- Slow down, kid.

237
00:21:20,621 --> 00:21:23,249
You have to learn
to take things as they come.

238
00:21:28,362 --> 00:21:31,490
Well, what's th-
What's this tunnel called?

239
00:21:31,565 --> 00:21:35,023
It's Tunnel 25. And this is 26.

240
00:21:35,102 --> 00:21:37,195
How do you know?

241
00:21:41,775 --> 00:21:43,834
Come on.

242
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,447
<i>- What's that for?</i>
<i>- Pressure.</i>

243
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,984
Waterwheel.

244
00:21:52,052 --> 00:21:54,043
And this?

245
00:21:54,121 --> 00:21:56,817
Don't know. It's not my job.

246
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:00,417
But you've worked here forever.
How could you not know?

247
00:22:00,494 --> 00:22:03,019
Mindin' my own business keeps me-

248
00:22:03,097 --> 00:22:05,531
keeps me busy enough.

249
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:09,865
Uh, can we go into the Generator?

250
00:22:52,146 --> 00:22:55,638
There's gotta be another way
into the Generator.

251
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:35,221
Huh. This tunnel's been erased.

252
00:25:16,123 --> 00:25:18,990
Hey! What are you doing here?

253
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:22,119
- You don't work in the storeroom.
- You're-You're Looper.

254
00:25:22,196 --> 00:25:25,632
- Uh, your brother was in my class.
- Oh.

255
00:25:25,699 --> 00:25:28,793
Thanks for the enlightening information.
Is that why you're here?

256
00:25:28,869 --> 00:25:30,803
- No. I'm training in the Pipeworks.
- Huh?

257
00:25:30,871 --> 00:25:32,532
- I'm-I'm training in the Pipeworks. I saw this-
- Huh?

258
00:25:32,606 --> 00:25:35,074
This rope. I-I-I got lost. I'm sorry.

259
00:25:35,142 --> 00:25:38,202
- Yeah, well, get lost again!
- Oh!

260
00:25:38,278 --> 00:25:40,872
You okay?

261
00:25:40,948 --> 00:25:42,882
Huh.

262
00:26:14,147 --> 00:26:16,445
<i>I'm over here!</i>

263
00:26:24,658 --> 00:26:27,058
<i>Lights, come on.</i>

264
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,960
<i>- Help me!</i>
- Please.

265
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:32,260
Please come on.

266
00:26:32,332 --> 00:26:34,197
<i>Lina? Lina?</i>

267
00:26:34,268 --> 00:26:36,202
- Doon?
<i>- Lina, keep talking.</i>

268
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,204
Doon, where are you?

269
00:26:38,272 --> 00:26:40,638
Where are you? Hey, you okay?

270
00:26:40,707 --> 00:26:42,641
- Yeah.
- Keep talking. Are you okay?

271
00:26:42,709 --> 00:26:44,734
Yeah, I'm okay.

272
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:47,905
Something's not right.

273
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:51,007
They never last this long.

274
00:26:52,686 --> 00:26:55,951
- What's that sound?
- It's the Generator.

275
00:26:56,023 --> 00:26:58,753
<i>- But they can fix it, right?</i>
<i>- Maybe for now.</i>

276
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:01,623
But we're-
We're running out of time.

277
00:27:01,695 --> 00:27:04,289
We have to do something.

278
00:27:04,364 --> 00:27:06,457
<i>There was a man this morning.</i>

279
00:27:06,533 --> 00:27:09,832
He came back from the Unknown Regions.
He said he heard water.

280
00:27:09,903 --> 00:27:12,599
Did you ever think
there might be a way out?

281
00:27:13,907 --> 00:27:15,841
A way out of Ember?

282
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:21,512
<i>All Pipeworkers.</i>

283
00:27:21,581 --> 00:27:23,640
<i>All Pipeworkers,</i>
<i>Electricians and Engineers-</i>

284
00:27:23,717 --> 00:27:25,947
- Look, I need to get down the Pipeworks.
<i>- report immediately.</i>

285
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:28,249
- You stay safe, Lina, okay?
- Doon.

286
00:27:28,322 --> 00:27:30,586
<i>- Attention, all Pipeworkers.</i>
- Doon!

287
00:27:30,657 --> 00:27:33,182
- Wait!
<i>- All Pipeworkers, Electricians, Engineers, report immediately.</i>

288
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,194
Where'd you get that?

289
00:27:35,262 --> 00:27:38,959
- I-I think it came from some kind of animal.
- No, where did you get it?

290
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:41,432
A man came back with it
from the Unknown Regions.

291
00:27:41,501 --> 00:27:43,492
It's from a beetle.

292
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,663
<i>- Messenger!</i>
- It's beautiful.

293
00:27:45,739 --> 00:27:48,299
- Can I keep it?
<i>- I have a message.</i>

294
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:51,674
Miss Sample, I need to get home
and check on my granny first.

295
00:27:51,745 --> 00:27:54,942
Pass the message as you go.
Tell everybody.

296
00:28:01,188 --> 00:28:03,281
Seven minutes!

297
00:28:03,357 --> 00:28:06,292
The power failure lasted seven minutes!

298
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,260
Twice as long as we've ever had!

299
00:28:08,328 --> 00:28:10,262
# It was so strong #

300
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:14,699
# But we live by the joy of our song #

301
00:28:14,768 --> 00:28:16,861
#The city shines-##

302
00:28:18,772 --> 00:28:20,763
Granny!

303
00:28:55,509 --> 00:28:57,500
No time! You better move!

304
00:28:58,645 --> 00:29:01,205
It's out of control!

305
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,715
- It's here somewhere.
- What's here?

306
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:08,949
Somewhere. Something.
It's very, very important.

307
00:29:09,022 --> 00:29:11,786
My great granddaddy-
He told me this.

308
00:29:11,858 --> 00:29:14,759
Wait here.

309
00:29:14,828 --> 00:29:18,423
Poppy, no. Give me that.

310
00:29:18,498 --> 00:29:20,432
Spit it out.

311
00:29:21,334 --> 00:29:23,598
Poppy, come on.

312
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:26,605
Pop- Mmm! Fine.

313
00:29:26,673 --> 00:29:29,437
You're ruining the couch, Granny.

314
00:29:31,745 --> 00:29:35,272
You-You found it.

315
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:39,318
- This is what you're looking for?
- Uh-huh.

316
00:29:39,386 --> 00:29:41,320
Are you sure?

317
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:45,248
What's so special about it?

318
00:29:48,128 --> 00:29:51,620
I don't- I forget. I don't remember.

319
00:29:55,302 --> 00:29:58,135
I don't remember.

320
00:29:59,739 --> 00:30:01,673
Okay, Granny.
I've gotta get back to work.

321
00:30:01,741 --> 00:30:03,732
Okay.

322
00:30:04,811 --> 00:30:08,144
See ya, Pop.

323
00:30:18,091 --> 00:30:20,025
Joss?

324
00:30:20,093 --> 00:30:21,890
<i>- Joss.</i>
- Don't bother asking.

325
00:30:21,962 --> 00:30:24,123
The Generator's broken.
It's hopeless.

326
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:26,427
<i>Next load!</i>

327
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,628
<i>I have a message for Seely Schnap.</i>

328
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:32,194
<i>I'm Seely Schnap. What is it?</i>

329
00:30:32,272 --> 00:30:34,763
- Munn Millders sent me.
- He did?

330
00:30:34,841 --> 00:30:37,435
He wants me to tell you that he
can't come over for lunch today.

331
00:30:37,511 --> 00:30:38,842
Oh.

332
00:30:38,912 --> 00:30:41,005
He said that your house
is too far away from his...

333
00:30:41,081 --> 00:30:43,049
and he's afraid of the blackouts.

334
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:54,327
I have a message...

335
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,726
for the mayor.

336
00:30:59,032 --> 00:31:00,932
"Your ship is in."

337
00:31:16,716 --> 00:31:19,583
Good day, Messenger.

338
00:31:19,653 --> 00:31:22,679
What brings you to the Gathering Hall?

339
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:25,884
I have a message for the mayor.

340
00:31:25,959 --> 00:31:27,586
Very good.

341
00:31:30,964 --> 00:31:33,660
Right this way, if you please.

342
00:31:37,971 --> 00:31:41,099
These pictures
are of all the mayors of Ember.

343
00:31:42,509 --> 00:31:44,443
I'm related to him.

344
00:31:44,511 --> 00:31:47,173
He was my great-great-

345
00:31:47,247 --> 00:31:50,614
I don't know how many "greats"-
grandfather.

346
00:31:50,684 --> 00:31:54,552
"Podd Morethwart,
Seventh Mayor of Ember."

347
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:58,113
We still live in the same place he did.

348
00:31:59,192 --> 00:32:01,183
Mmm.

349
00:32:15,008 --> 00:32:16,942
<i>Come in.</i>

350
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:28,977
I recognize you
from Assignment Day, don't I?

351
00:32:29,055 --> 00:32:32,786
She's a direct descendant
of our seventh mayor.

352
00:32:32,859 --> 00:32:36,056
Are you? How nice. Name?

353
00:32:36,129 --> 00:32:39,997
- Lina Mayfleet.
- "Mayfleet"?

354
00:32:40,066 --> 00:32:44,503
<i>That is a name for a Messenger.</i>

355
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:50,109
May your feet be fleet.

356
00:32:56,416 --> 00:32:59,146
<i>Apparently,</i>
<i>you were born for the job.</i>

357
00:32:59,219 --> 00:33:01,244
What is your message for me,
Lina Mayfleet?

358
00:33:01,321 --> 00:33:03,687
It's from Looper, sir.

359
00:33:03,757 --> 00:33:06,282
Oh.

360
00:33:16,102 --> 00:33:18,332
"Your ship is in."

361
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,874
Excellent.

362
00:33:28,415 --> 00:33:31,384
What are those boxes
in the portraits, sir?

363
00:33:31,451 --> 00:33:34,352
Is that part of the message?

364
00:33:34,421 --> 00:33:37,015
No, I was just curious.

365
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:39,650
Thank you.

366
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:47,591
<i>- Attention. Sewage spill in Apartment Block 14.</i>

367
00:33:47,667 --> 00:33:49,999
<i>Plumbers and Bucketmen, be advised.</i>

368
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:54,029
I'm just looking after myself. You've heard
the rumors. You know what they're saying.

369
00:33:54,107 --> 00:33:56,803
- It's going black for good.
- What's going black for good?

370
00:33:56,876 --> 00:33:59,071
Clean your ears, Little Miss Nosy.

371
00:33:59,145 --> 00:34:01,079
I said "back."

372
00:34:01,147 --> 00:34:03,081
<i>Going back for good.</i>

373
00:34:05,452 --> 00:34:07,386
Did you deliver the message?

374
00:34:09,723 --> 00:34:11,816
Ember's been here a long time.

375
00:34:12,892 --> 00:34:15,087
Blackouts or no blackouts...

376
00:34:15,161 --> 00:34:17,095
the Generator hasn't failed us yet.

377
00:34:17,163 --> 00:34:19,324
The Generator won't last.

378
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:21,367
It's falling apart.

379
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,595
And no one knows
what they're doing down there.

380
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:26,161
Something's really wrong.

381
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,230
What can you do about it?

382
00:34:28,308 --> 00:34:30,242
Hmm?

383
00:34:31,578 --> 00:34:34,479
What can <i>you</i> do about it?

384
00:34:45,825 --> 00:34:48,885
How do you explain
that this used to be so small?

385
00:34:53,366 --> 00:34:55,800
You're gonna
give yourself a headache.

386
00:35:25,799 --> 00:35:27,664
"Ember."

387
00:35:29,536 --> 00:35:31,265
"Time."

388
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,736
"Support life."

389
00:35:42,415 --> 00:35:44,440
"One: Proceed."

390
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:47,247
"Two: R-Release."

391
00:36:09,409 --> 00:36:11,468
It's so shiny.

392
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:15,173
What do you think it is?

393
00:36:15,248 --> 00:36:17,443
<i>I need 20 packages of light bulbs.</i>

394
00:36:17,517 --> 00:36:20,384
<i>My shop's outta peas.</i>
<i>I need 15 airtights.</i>

395
00:36:20,453 --> 00:36:23,354
Well, ya can't have 15.
You can only have three.

396
00:36:23,423 --> 00:36:26,688
<i>Don't give me that. Just yesterday I saw</i>
<i>plenty airtights in Pott Street Market.</i>

397
00:36:26,759 --> 00:36:29,159
Well, that's why there aren't
so many today, isn't it?

398
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:32,289
- Don't be smart with me.
- What do you want me to do? Make peas out of thin air?

399
00:36:32,365 --> 00:36:34,629
- Next!
- I need help right now, please!

400
00:36:43,042 --> 00:36:46,239
- Did-Did we find it?
- Lie back, Roo.

401
00:36:46,312 --> 00:36:48,371
- Did we-
- You need to stay in bed today.

402
00:36:48,448 --> 00:36:51,076
We found it, Granny.

403
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:53,084
Found it.

404
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,513
Granny, what is it?

405
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,523
Can you tell me?

406
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:01,059
- Don't ask her to talk now.
<i>- Found it.</i>

407
00:37:01,127 --> 00:37:03,493
What's best for you is to sleep.

408
00:37:03,563 --> 00:37:07,522
<i>Isn't there any medicine you can give her?</i>

409
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,932
I'm low on medicine. I'm sorry.

410
00:37:11,504 --> 00:37:14,405
Give her as much water
as she'll drink, eh?

411
00:37:16,342 --> 00:37:18,674
Can you look at Poppy too?

412
00:37:18,745 --> 00:37:20,679
Hang onto her.

413
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,042
I'm just gonna look in your mouth.

414
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:28,610
Don't bite.

415
00:37:29,689 --> 00:37:33,216
Well, what was that doing there?

416
00:37:46,506 --> 00:37:49,942
Poppy. Poppy, stop.

417
00:37:52,378 --> 00:37:55,711
Poppy, stand still. Don't move.

418
00:37:58,518 --> 00:38:01,180
Okay. Okay, I've got you.

419
00:38:05,191 --> 00:38:07,819
Granny, we're coming.

420
00:38:10,196 --> 00:38:12,130
<i>Granny?</i>

421
00:38:30,883 --> 00:38:34,842
<i> You and Poppy have to share,</i>
<i>but I think the bed's big enough.</i>

422
00:38:36,923 --> 00:38:40,381
<i>Poppy, let's make some dinner</i>
<i>and let your sister get settled.</i>

423
00:38:50,236 --> 00:38:53,171
Do you know your part?

424
00:38:55,675 --> 00:38:57,609
Um-

425
00:38:57,677 --> 00:39:00,703
I-I think I remember it pretty well
from last year.

426
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:04,876
Oh, the Great Day of Singing
is so important.

427
00:39:04,951 --> 00:39:08,443
Oh, it lifts all of our hearts.
How lucky we are.

428
00:39:10,123 --> 00:39:12,990
I don't feel very lucky lately.

429
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:17,189
- There's nothing to worry about.
- The blackouts worry everybody.

430
00:39:17,263 --> 00:39:19,993
Help is coming.

431
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:22,000
- Help?
- Mm-hmm.

432
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,195
Who built our city, dear?

433
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:27,068
- The... Builders?
- That's right.

434
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:30,803
And the Builders will come again
and show us the way.

435
00:39:41,988 --> 00:39:45,549
Whatever it is, Granny,
I'll figure it out.

436
00:39:47,226 --> 00:39:49,160
I promise.

437
00:40:06,846 --> 00:40:10,179
<i>- It says "Pipeworks. ''</i>
- That's why I brought it to you.

438
00:40:10,249 --> 00:40:12,615
This printing-

439
00:40:12,685 --> 00:40:15,176
You know what it reminds me of?

440
00:40:15,254 --> 00:40:17,586
Come on.
I gotta show you something.

441
00:40:23,362 --> 00:40:25,421
What are we doing here?

442
00:40:25,498 --> 00:40:28,433
The Builders left us this book.
We learned about it in History.

443
00:40:40,546 --> 00:40:42,537
Go on. Open it up.

444
00:40:44,283 --> 00:40:46,945
N-No one but the mayor's supposed to.

445
00:40:58,898 --> 00:41:00,957
The Builders wrote these instructions.

446
00:41:01,033 --> 00:41:03,263
It's exactly the same.

447
00:41:33,399 --> 00:41:35,367
Come on.

448
00:41:35,434 --> 00:41:37,834
There's something I have to show you.

449
00:41:39,405 --> 00:41:42,533
- Wow.
- What do you think?

450
00:41:42,608 --> 00:41:45,736
- I think it's instructions.
- Yeah?

451
00:41:45,812 --> 00:41:48,975
What I don't understand is,
why would they have it in a circle?

452
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:51,039
- I mean, I know it must be important.
- Add a "T."

453
00:41:51,117 --> 00:41:53,051
- What?
- Add a "T."

454
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,883
E-X-I-T. Exit.

455
00:41:55,955 --> 00:41:58,389
What if there's an exit from Ember?

456
00:42:05,598 --> 00:42:08,499
I don't think
we're supposed to be down here.

457
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:11,765
<i>This tunnel was erased from Sul's map.</i>

458
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:13,897
<i>It dead-ends in a locked room.</i>

459
00:42:16,876 --> 00:42:19,003
This could be it.

460
00:42:28,988 --> 00:42:32,185
<i>- That was just the last time.</i>
- Come on.

461
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,226
<i>- The time before that I-</i>
<i>- Shh.</i>

462
00:42:35,461 --> 00:42:37,895
<i>You're gonna get us caught.</i>

463
00:42:37,964 --> 00:42:39,898
Come on.

464
00:42:55,681 --> 00:42:58,514
What was that?

465
00:42:59,652 --> 00:43:01,620
I have no idea.

466
00:43:45,298 --> 00:43:47,061
Run.

467
00:43:49,969 --> 00:43:51,834
Lina! Up here!

468
00:43:51,904 --> 00:43:55,738
<i>Go, go, go, go, go! Quickly, quickly!</i>

469
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:00,971
Hurry! Get the box!

470
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:05,943
Run!

471
00:44:48,027 --> 00:44:50,393
Hey!

472
00:44:50,463 --> 00:44:52,897
<i>Over here!</i>

473
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:04,370
Lina! Lina! He's stuck! Jump!

474
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,684
Thanks for another great idea.

475
00:45:16,756 --> 00:45:18,986
Moles need to eat all the time
just to stay alive.

476
00:45:19,058 --> 00:45:21,356
Probably just as hungry as we are.

477
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,598
Did you see those storerooms?
They're completely empty.

478
00:45:30,669 --> 00:45:32,660
We're gonna run out of food.

479
00:45:36,342 --> 00:45:39,539
It doesn't matter anyway.
The Generator won't last.

480
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:42,479
<i>And pretty soon</i>
<i>it'll be black for good.</i>

481
00:45:46,752 --> 00:45:51,018
"Mayfleet." That's my name.

482
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:53,422
The man who wore that helmet
before me drowned.

483
00:45:56,796 --> 00:45:59,629
Drowned?

484
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,225
He worked here.

485
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:06,465
There's no water
but the irrigation pipes.

486
00:46:07,873 --> 00:46:09,864
How could he have drowned?

487
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:13,503
<i>I miss him so much.</i>

488
00:46:15,681 --> 00:46:18,707
Mom too.

489
00:46:18,784 --> 00:46:21,981
How am I ever gonna figure out
what this is all about?

490
00:46:22,054 --> 00:46:24,284
It's all these zeros.

491
00:46:24,356 --> 00:46:26,790
That's what scares me the most.

492
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:30,124
What would count down to nothing?

493
00:46:32,898 --> 00:46:35,423
- It sounds like doomsday.
- Oh, shh.

494
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:37,594
Please, honey.

495
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:40,696
Don't do anything foolish.

496
00:46:40,773 --> 00:46:42,764
I couldn't bear to lose you too.

497
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:44,969
How did he die, Clary?

498
00:46:45,044 --> 00:46:46,978
Oh.

499
00:46:48,047 --> 00:46:49,981
Did he really drown?

500
00:47:03,929 --> 00:47:07,524
Your father thought
it was doomsday too.

501
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,592
<i>He believed there was a way</i>
<i>to get out of Ember.</i>

502
00:47:10,669 --> 00:47:13,467
<i>I couldn't dissuade him.</i>

503
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:17,908
<i>I said it was our duty to stay here</i>
<i>and fix our problems...</i>

504
00:47:17,977 --> 00:47:20,605
that it's illegal to venture out
into the Unknown.

505
00:47:20,679 --> 00:47:22,374
Why is it illegal?

506
00:47:28,154 --> 00:47:32,352
Your father said,
"The river runs in one direction...

507
00:47:32,424 --> 00:47:37,521
<i>so it must come from someplace</i>
<i>and go to someplace. ''</i>

508
00:47:37,596 --> 00:47:42,124
<i>But he must've hit it too early or something.</i>
<i>I- I don't know.</i>

509
00:47:42,201 --> 00:47:45,568
<i>The tunnel flooded, and-</i>

510
00:47:45,638 --> 00:47:49,335
<i>And my dad died.</i>

511
00:47:53,112 --> 00:47:55,706
He was by himself?

512
00:47:55,781 --> 00:47:59,410
Everyone else got out
before it collapsed.

513
00:48:05,391 --> 00:48:09,691
I was- I was considering
taking the box to the mayor.

514
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:12,162
<i>Yes! Do that.</i>

515
00:48:12,231 --> 00:48:14,597
Do that instead, please.

516
00:48:14,667 --> 00:48:17,329
Let him handle the situation.

517
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:24,739
<i>These are trying and troubled times.</i>

518
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:28,576
Our problems are grave.

519
00:48:30,416 --> 00:48:32,407
We need answers.

520
00:48:32,484 --> 00:48:34,748
<i>But beyond answers-</i>

521
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:38,722
more important than answers-

522
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:41,191
we need solutions.

523
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:43,194
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

524
00:48:43,262 --> 00:48:46,629
And in order to find those solutions...

525
00:48:48,534 --> 00:48:53,369
I propose we launch
a thorough investigation.

526
00:48:53,439 --> 00:48:55,532
Yes. Yes.

527
00:48:55,608 --> 00:48:59,442
I hereby declare
the creation of a task force...

528
00:48:59,511 --> 00:49:01,502
to investigate the blackouts.

529
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:09,249
<i>Do I have volunteers?</i>

530
00:49:13,025 --> 00:49:18,019
Today we, the people...

531
00:49:18,097 --> 00:49:20,793
stand united against the darkness.

532
00:49:32,878 --> 00:49:34,675
My turn!

533
00:49:34,747 --> 00:49:37,238
Lizzie.

534
00:49:37,316 --> 00:49:39,079
Lizzie!

535
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:46,014
<i>Hands off! Give me that!</i>

536
00:49:46,091 --> 00:49:48,286
- Peaches!
- All right! Go away!

537
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,022
<i>Back off!</i>

538
00:49:51,096 --> 00:49:53,530
What's "applesauce"?

539
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:55,658
<i>Hey, give me some!</i>

540
00:49:56,935 --> 00:49:58,818
Pineapple?

541
00:49:58,819 --> 00:50:00,701
- Give me that!
- Come on!

542
00:50:00,773 --> 00:50:04,641
No one's had pineapple since my grandmother
was a little girl. Where'd you get this?

543
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,769
Give me that!

544
00:50:06,845 --> 00:50:09,313
Lizzie! Where'd you get that food?

545
00:50:11,517 --> 00:50:13,485
All right.

546
00:50:14,586 --> 00:50:17,384
I got it from my boyfriend.

547
00:50:17,456 --> 00:50:19,185
You don't have a boyfriend.

548
00:50:19,258 --> 00:50:22,455
It's not official, but there's this guy
who really likes me.

549
00:50:22,528 --> 00:50:26,294
He explores the storerooms,
especially the ones on the edges.

550
00:50:26,365 --> 00:50:29,198
They're marked empty in the ledger,
but they're not all empty.

551
00:50:29,268 --> 00:50:31,930
I'll give you a bite
if you promise not to tell.

552
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:38,037
- It's wrong, Lizzie.
- Well, he says it's all gonna be gone soon anyway.

553
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:40,476
Why not live as well
as we can right now?

554
00:50:40,546 --> 00:50:42,537
There he is.

555
00:50:54,093 --> 00:50:56,152
Doon!

556
00:50:56,228 --> 00:50:58,219
Have you-

557
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,334
<i>Doon!</i>

558
00:51:08,307 --> 00:51:10,241
I need to tell you something.

559
00:51:10,309 --> 00:51:13,244
<i>It was Looper we saw</i>
<i>near that 351 door.</i>

560
00:51:13,312 --> 00:51:15,803
Before that, I took a message
to the mayor for him.

561
00:51:18,584 --> 00:51:21,576
<i>I'll bet there's something big</i>
<i>on the other side of that door.</i>

562
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:44,465
<i>There's so much food.</i>

563
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:18,275
Go.

564
00:52:28,253 --> 00:52:31,347
And I thought he was lying
when he talked about finding a solution.

565
00:52:31,423 --> 00:52:33,357
He wasn't lying.

566
00:52:33,425 --> 00:52:35,586
He's found his solution.

567
00:52:35,661 --> 00:52:37,993
Poppy. Lie down, okay?

568
00:52:38,063 --> 00:52:40,122
It's time to go to sleep.

569
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:42,929
Could you just pump those pedals?

570
00:52:43,001 --> 00:52:45,196
What is this?

571
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:48,865
It's the answering machine tape
from my parents' phone.

572
00:52:48,941 --> 00:52:51,000
When we still had one.

573
00:52:51,076 --> 00:52:54,443
Yoo-hoo. Yoo-hoo!

574
00:52:54,513 --> 00:52:56,447
Anybody home?

575
00:52:56,515 --> 00:53:00,007
<i>Don't hold dinner for me, darling.</i>

576
00:53:00,085 --> 00:53:02,110
- That's my dad's voice.
<i>- I'll be there before lights out.</i>

577
00:53:04,022 --> 00:53:08,288
Raine, it's me, Barrow.
I've been thinkin' about it.

578
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:12,592
I watch my boy,
and... I've come around.

579
00:53:12,664 --> 00:53:16,225
I've changed my mind. I'm in.

580
00:53:17,369 --> 00:53:19,701
What's wrong?

581
00:53:23,542 --> 00:53:26,170
He lied to me.

582
00:53:26,245 --> 00:53:28,873
Where are you going?

583
00:53:28,947 --> 00:53:31,711
Well, meet me
at the Greenhouses, okay?

584
00:53:31,783 --> 00:53:34,217
<i>Good night, young man.</i>

585
00:53:34,286 --> 00:53:37,084
How was your rehearsal?

586
00:53:39,157 --> 00:53:41,648
For the Singing.

587
00:53:41,727 --> 00:53:45,185
Oh. I-It was fine.

588
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:48,358
- It was really good.
- Good.

589
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:51,425
- Good night.
<i>- Good night.</i>

590
00:53:54,139 --> 00:53:57,040
Dad. I heard you.

591
00:53:57,109 --> 00:53:59,202
<i>I heard you on the answering-</i>

592
00:53:59,278 --> 00:54:03,146
Lina Mayfleet has her parents'
old answering machine tape.

593
00:54:03,215 --> 00:54:06,048
I heard you.
You said her dad could count you in.

594
00:54:10,188 --> 00:54:12,918
You tried to leave the city, didn't you?

595
00:54:14,226 --> 00:54:16,717
W-Why would I do that?

596
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:18,456
Because of me.

597
00:54:27,306 --> 00:54:29,206
Dad.

598
00:54:29,274 --> 00:54:31,208
<i>Please.</i>

599
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:36,804
- We were wrong.
- No, you were right.

600
00:54:36,882 --> 00:54:38,816
There is an exit.

601
00:54:38,884 --> 00:54:42,115
Yeah. Raine thought so, too,
and it got him killed, Son.

602
00:54:42,187 --> 00:54:44,348
Dad, there's a way out
in the Pipeworks...

603
00:54:44,423 --> 00:54:46,482
but you have to tell me
everything that you know.

604
00:54:46,558 --> 00:54:49,925
- Tell me what you know.
- I don't know anything, and neither do you.

605
00:54:51,563 --> 00:54:53,531
<i>The Builders left Instructions.</i>

606
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:55,624
The Builders abandoned us.

607
00:54:55,701 --> 00:54:58,465
No, they didn't.
They didn't, Dad. I have proof.

608
00:55:02,074 --> 00:55:03,974
Show me.

609
00:55:20,225 --> 00:55:22,853
Wait!

610
00:55:22,928 --> 00:55:25,863
Oh. Happy Great Day of Singing,
young lady.

611
00:55:25,931 --> 00:55:28,764
I need to speak to you in private.

612
00:55:28,834 --> 00:55:31,098
Very well then.

613
00:55:31,169 --> 00:55:34,605
What I need to tell you is secret
and really important.

614
00:55:34,673 --> 00:55:37,335
- What is it?
- The mayor- He's got a bunker in the Pipeworks.

615
00:55:37,409 --> 00:55:39,400
It's filled with food.

616
00:55:41,747 --> 00:55:44,238
The shortages aren't as bad
as everyone thinks.

617
00:55:46,451 --> 00:55:49,545
You mean the mayor is stealing?

618
00:55:49,621 --> 00:55:52,920
Looper, who works in the storerooms,
is helping him.

619
00:55:55,427 --> 00:55:57,418
Well, this is shocking.

620
00:55:58,597 --> 00:56:02,089
Shocking. I'm shocked.

621
00:56:04,202 --> 00:56:07,535
Um, we have to report this.

622
00:56:07,606 --> 00:56:09,540
Come with me.

623
00:56:09,608 --> 00:56:11,673
Well done, Lina Mayfleet.

624
00:56:11,674 --> 00:56:13,738
Once you arrest him, Doon and I can show you where the room is -

625
00:56:13,812 --> 00:56:16,280
<i>Wait. Where are we going?</i>

626
00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:41,171
I beg your pardon, Your Honor.

627
00:56:41,239 --> 00:56:44,766
<i>You remember Lina Mayfleet?</i>

628
00:56:44,843 --> 00:56:46,902
She wants to accuse you.

629
00:56:49,147 --> 00:56:51,081
Accuse me of what?

630
00:56:51,149 --> 00:56:53,344
Of stealing food
from the people of Ember.

631
00:56:55,487 --> 00:56:59,389
I love my city and everyone in it.

632
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:06,921
And I would never think
to do such a thing.

633
00:57:06,998 --> 00:57:09,125
We saw your room!
We saw you in it!

634
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:14,068
- "We"?
- She and her friend, Doon Harrow.

635
00:57:17,776 --> 00:57:20,711
What's that box?

636
00:57:20,779 --> 00:57:22,713
<i>Hmm.</i>

637
00:57:22,781 --> 00:57:24,715
It's mine.

638
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:28,881
It's unusual looking.

639
00:57:28,954 --> 00:57:32,219
Where'd you get that?

640
00:57:36,228 --> 00:57:38,662
You're related to one of the mayors.

641
00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:41,221
Yes. Uh, he was the seventh mayor.

642
00:57:48,073 --> 00:57:51,304
A lot of things got lost
when the seventh mayor passed.

643
00:57:52,310 --> 00:57:54,301
May I look at that box, Lina?

644
00:57:54,379 --> 00:57:58,315
- Why?
- What's inside the box, Lina?

645
00:57:58,383 --> 00:58:02,513
I imagine it's official
mayor-related business.

646
00:58:03,822 --> 00:58:06,347
<i>Box. Give it to me.</i>

647
00:58:06,424 --> 00:58:08,949
- It's not yours.
- Give me the box!

648
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:11,587
- No!
- Get it from her. Now.

649
00:58:12,597 --> 00:58:14,622
<i>Take it from her! Move!</i>

650
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:16,997
<i>Grab her!</i>

651
00:58:17,068 --> 00:58:20,629
Have you got her?

652
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:41,552
Get her.

653
00:58:54,639 --> 00:58:57,199
Stop! After her!

654
00:59:16,161 --> 00:59:19,096
Is this the home of Doon Harrow?

655
00:59:19,164 --> 00:59:21,325
Is he here?

656
00:59:21,399 --> 00:59:25,233
I-I-I can't hear. I have a weak ear.
Y-You have to talk louder.

657
00:59:25,303 --> 00:59:27,828
- Doon Harrow!
- Doon Harro- No, Loris.

658
00:59:27,906 --> 00:59:31,000
We're looking for Doon Harrow.
He's charged with treason against the city.

659
00:59:31,076 --> 00:59:34,705
That's terrible.
If it's true, he's no son of mine!

660
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:37,247
<i>Treason is the worst offense</i>
<i>anyone could possibly commit.</i>

661
00:59:37,315 --> 00:59:41,445
Builders were wise when they said,
"If you have proof, you have to pursue it!

662
00:59:41,519 --> 00:59:45,353
<i>There's more to a bottle cap than</i>
<i>keeping liquid from leaking out of glass!''</i>

663
00:59:45,423 --> 00:59:47,254
- Get him!
- Uh, we'll go this way.

664
00:59:47,325 --> 00:59:50,988
Doon! The guards are here!
You traitor!

665
00:59:51,062 --> 00:59:53,394
- In here. Follow him.
- They're comin' to get you!

666
00:59:54,499 --> 00:59:56,729
The keypad is somewhere.

667
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:58,996
What's he doin'?

668
00:59:59,070 --> 01:00:01,061
- Just one second.
<i>- He's crazy.</i>

669
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:03,869
<i>- Is this the way to your apartment?</i>
- Apparently not.

670
01:00:16,621 --> 01:00:19,818
<i>Upstairs!</i>

671
01:00:29,067 --> 01:00:31,001
- They're after me!
- Who?

672
01:00:31,069 --> 01:00:33,003
- Guards!
- Why?

673
01:00:33,071 --> 01:00:35,130
Doon and I, we- Quick.

674
01:00:35,206 --> 01:00:38,266
<i>What is this all about?</i>
<i>We'll be late for the Great Day of Singing.</i>

675
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:40,277
Well, excuse me, ma'am.

676
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:42,472
I'm- I'm looking for Lina Mayfleet.

677
01:00:42,547 --> 01:00:44,811
Well, she's not here. She's probably
already in Harken Square.

678
01:00:44,883 --> 01:00:46,583
Okay, okay. Well, I guess
I'll just have a look for myself.

679
01:00:46,584 --> 01:00:48,284
Oh! Excuse me.

680
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:51,083
Beg your pardon! So sorry.

681
01:00:54,159 --> 01:00:58,562
<i>You know, the mayor did</i>
<i>ask for her specifically.</i>

682
01:00:58,630 --> 01:01:01,827
The Greenhouse. Uh, she was meeting
a friend at the Greenhouse.

683
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:03,834
<i>Does that help?</i>

684
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:36,029
Careful!
That's food you're destroying!

685
01:01:36,101 --> 01:01:38,501
Our food!

686
01:01:42,374 --> 01:01:44,308
<i>Psst!</i>

687
01:02:07,132 --> 01:02:09,066
A warning:

688
01:02:09,134 --> 01:02:12,831
If I discover you were helping, harboring
or otherwise assisting those kids-

689
01:02:12,904 --> 01:02:14,895
Why would I do that?

690
01:02:18,543 --> 01:02:21,011
I have information
they were coming this way.

691
01:02:21,079 --> 01:02:23,070
Who provided you
with that information?

692
01:02:23,148 --> 01:02:25,582
That's confidential.

693
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:30,144
All I need for you to understand is this:
If you're involved, you'll regret it.

694
01:02:31,823 --> 01:02:34,917
<i>- Anything you hear, anything you see...</i>

695
01:02:34,993 --> 01:02:37,018
you tell me.

696
01:02:38,430 --> 01:02:40,398
Otherwise,
there will be consequences.

697
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:45,198
Should anything happen in the future
that you hear of or see...

698
01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:47,204
<i>I'll expect to be informed.</i>

699
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:50,936
I don't need to tell you
that I have the mayor's ear.

700
01:03:01,986 --> 01:03:03,977
<i>Hmm.</i>

701
01:03:30,682 --> 01:03:32,616
Okay.

702
01:03:32,684 --> 01:03:35,744
Leave two guards behind!

703
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:38,345
We've gotta find a way out of here.

704
01:03:38,423 --> 01:03:40,323
Now.

705
01:03:47,765 --> 01:03:49,699
What is this?

706
01:03:58,877 --> 01:04:01,107
My dad made this.

707
01:04:04,048 --> 01:04:06,039
It doesn't look very safe.

708
01:04:06,117 --> 01:04:08,608
That's my dad.

709
01:04:12,624 --> 01:04:14,615
Everything he makes looks like this.

710
01:04:14,692 --> 01:04:17,024
What do you mean, your dad?

711
01:04:17,095 --> 01:04:20,690
Barrow. His voice is on
your answering machine.

712
01:04:20,765 --> 01:04:23,529
But your dad's name is Loris.

713
01:04:23,601 --> 01:04:27,037
Barrow Harrow. It's his nickname.

714
01:04:27,105 --> 01:04:29,972
- After some wheelbarrow he used to push around.
- You're the boy!

715
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:34,071
That means our parents
were trying to escape together.

716
01:04:35,213 --> 01:04:37,704
They were trying.

717
01:04:37,782 --> 01:04:41,513
We're running out of time.
They'll come back for us.

718
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:00,370
Pedal!

719
01:05:04,309 --> 01:05:07,403
Now, you stay here and be a good girl.

720
01:05:07,478 --> 01:05:09,708
Okay? And look for me up there.

721
01:05:09,781 --> 01:05:12,909
- Where's Lina?
- Oh, I'm- She's here somewhere.

722
01:05:17,655 --> 01:05:20,522
- Can you see anything?
- Barely.

723
01:05:33,037 --> 01:05:35,972
Here it is again-
the moment in the year...

724
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:39,635
when we pause to celebrate
our fair city.

725
01:05:39,711 --> 01:05:42,077
This beacon of light...

726
01:05:42,146 --> 01:05:43,943
in a world of darkness.

727
01:05:45,350 --> 01:05:47,284
Hold on!

728
01:06:01,699 --> 01:06:03,633
Okay. That stuff- Cover it.

729
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:10,770
This miracle of planning...

730
01:06:10,842 --> 01:06:13,902
<i>this magnificent achievement...</i>

731
01:06:13,978 --> 01:06:18,176
that is our city of Ember.

732
01:06:26,758 --> 01:06:29,352
#This is all we know #

733
01:06:29,427 --> 01:06:32,157
# Ember is forever #

734
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:34,858
#When the light comes on #

735
01:06:34,932 --> 01:06:38,129
# I will be with you #

736
01:06:38,336 --> 01:06:40,998
#When the light comes on #

737
01:06:41,072 --> 01:06:44,041
# Hope is everlasting #

738
01:06:44,108 --> 01:06:45,803
They started singing.

739
01:06:45,877 --> 01:06:50,940
<i># The morning light</i>
<i>Spend some time with you #

740
01:06:53,918 --> 01:06:57,718
Oh, I've gotta show you.
The mayor had one too.

741
01:06:59,057 --> 01:07:02,549
- He gave this to you?
- Not exactly.

742
01:07:17,041 --> 01:07:18,975
The Generator.

743
01:07:19,043 --> 01:07:21,739
Okay. We have to get there.

744
01:07:21,813 --> 01:07:24,043
We have to get there now.

745
01:07:24,115 --> 01:07:26,049
Come on.

746
01:07:26,117 --> 01:07:28,483
Wait! Poppy.

747
01:07:28,553 --> 01:07:32,819
# I will be with you #

748
01:07:32,890 --> 01:07:35,085
#This is all we know #

749
01:07:35,159 --> 01:07:38,219
<i># Ember is forever#</i>

750
01:07:38,296 --> 01:07:40,662
- #When the light comes on #
<i>- Yoo-hoo!</i>

751
01:07:40,732 --> 01:07:43,895
# I will be with you #

752
01:07:43,968 --> 01:07:46,903
- #This is all we know #

753
01:07:46,971 --> 01:07:50,236

01:07:50,308 --> 01:07:52,776
- #When the light comes on #
<i>- Yoo-hoo!</i>

755
01:07:52,844 --> 01:07:56,712
# I will be with you #

756
01:07:56,781 --> 01:07:59,807
- #When the light comes on #
- Come here.

757
01:07:59,884 --> 01:08:03,581
# Hope is everlasting ##

758
01:08:20,605 --> 01:08:22,971
That's it.

759
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,971
Poppy.

760
01:08:32,049 --> 01:08:34,540
<i>Maybe he knows.</i>

761
01:08:34,619 --> 01:08:36,985
Sul. Sul.

762
01:08:37,054 --> 01:08:39,215
Okay, we have to get him on his feet.

763
01:08:39,290 --> 01:08:43,488
Wake up. Sul, is there a key
to the Generator door?

764
01:08:43,561 --> 01:08:45,495
Sure, there's a key.

765
01:08:45,563 --> 01:08:47,997
Great. Where is it?

766
01:08:48,065 --> 01:08:50,625
How should I know?
It's not my job.

767
01:09:00,511 --> 01:09:02,945
Wait.

768
01:09:04,182 --> 01:09:06,241
Something's not right.

769
01:09:06,317 --> 01:09:09,616
The Builders were smart.
They would have made it simple.

770
01:09:09,687 --> 01:09:11,951
I wouldn't call any of this simple.

771
01:09:14,125 --> 01:09:16,491
They would have thought it through.

772
01:09:18,429 --> 01:09:20,363
They planned...

773
01:09:28,239 --> 01:09:30,173
everything.

774
01:09:38,249 --> 01:09:40,183
Doon.

775
01:09:45,056 --> 01:09:47,524
There's something behind those lockers.

776
01:09:49,961 --> 01:09:52,395
Poppy, come on. Let's go. Quick.

777
01:09:56,801 --> 01:09:59,133
There's gotta be a way in.

778
01:10:34,205 --> 01:10:36,605
What... are these for?

779
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:41,108
"Bo-at."

780
01:10:41,178 --> 01:10:43,169
"Boat."

781
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:50,787
Okay. "Release by"-

782
01:10:50,855 --> 01:10:52,447
<i>- "Rotating''-</i>
- Something.

783
01:10:52,523 --> 01:10:54,354
<i>- "Mechanism clockwise. ''</i>
- "Clockwise."

784
01:10:57,695 --> 01:11:00,323
It's that. It has to be.

785
01:11:00,398 --> 01:11:03,060
Okay.

786
01:11:27,158 --> 01:11:29,626
Poppy!

787
01:11:40,571 --> 01:11:42,562
There's more coming.

788
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:47,106
There's another one. Look.

789
01:13:14,799 --> 01:13:17,597
<i>The water level is too low!</i>
<i>It's gonna hit.</i>

790
01:13:20,404 --> 01:13:23,202
It should have moved out of the way.

791
01:13:23,274 --> 01:13:26,539
We're not supposed to skip ahead.

792
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:30,637
- We need to follow the Instructions exactly.
- Okay.

793
01:13:30,715 --> 01:13:32,706
It's what the Builders
would have wanted.

794
01:13:32,783 --> 01:13:34,717
- Okay. Come on.
- Okay. Um-

795
01:13:34,785 --> 01:13:37,720
<i>"Access''-</i>
<i>Something, something.</i>

796
01:13:37,788 --> 01:13:40,348
- "1 room."
- 1 room.

797
01:13:40,424 --> 01:13:42,790
Room-

798
01:13:48,666 --> 01:13:51,965
<i>Come on, Poppy.</i>
<i>Come on. Move it.</i>

799
01:14:01,178 --> 01:14:03,476
It wasn't "1 room"
we were looking for.

800
01:14:03,547 --> 01:14:07,210
It was "L."
"Emergency Control Room."

801
01:14:08,686 --> 01:14:11,177
Okay.

802
01:14:11,255 --> 01:14:13,587
The cards. Let's try the cards.

803
01:14:13,657 --> 01:14:15,591
Okay.

804
01:14:28,405 --> 01:14:30,339
Oh, come on!

805
01:14:30,407 --> 01:14:32,466
Come on!

806
01:14:38,182 --> 01:14:40,116
Nice work, Poppy.

807
01:14:41,352 --> 01:14:43,252
Okay.

808
01:15:12,249 --> 01:15:14,717
Are you okay?

809
01:16:01,232 --> 01:16:03,700
The cards. Get the cards.

810
01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:17,276
"Set waterwheel 1 to full thrust."

811
01:16:17,348 --> 01:16:20,283
Waterwheel 1. Full thrust.

812
01:16:27,258 --> 01:16:31,194
<i>Okay. It's moving.</i>
<i>Okay. What's next?</i>

813
01:16:31,262 --> 01:16:33,526
Um, "Set waterwheel 2 to full stop."

814
01:16:33,597 --> 01:16:36,122
Waterwheel 2. Full stop.

815
01:16:53,684 --> 01:16:55,413
It's stuck.

816
01:17:13,504 --> 01:17:15,301
Sul.

817
01:17:16,573 --> 01:17:18,507
<i>Sul!</i>

818
01:17:20,311 --> 01:17:22,245
Stay here.

819
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:32,121
<i>Sul! Sul!</i>

820
01:17:32,189 --> 01:17:34,919
Go away, boy! Go away!

821
01:17:34,992 --> 01:17:37,153
Sul, what are you doing up here?

822
01:17:37,227 --> 01:17:40,754
This thing is jammed stuck!
I've gotta free it.

823
01:17:40,831 --> 01:17:42,992
How do you know
that's what you should do?

824
01:17:46,837 --> 01:17:49,237
It's my job!

825
01:17:50,374 --> 01:17:53,366
Aah! Nothing's working.

826
01:17:53,444 --> 01:17:55,469
Try this!

827
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:05,311
It's beginning to move!

828
01:18:06,357 --> 01:18:08,689
It's moving!

829
01:18:10,761 --> 01:18:13,355
- It's working, Sul!
- It's working!

830
01:18:13,430 --> 01:18:16,831
Sul, this is the exit!
It's the way out of Ember!

831
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:19,664
- To where, boy?
- We'll find out!

832
01:18:46,497 --> 01:18:48,988
#The Builders have always known #

833
01:18:49,066 --> 01:18:55,027
# But you and you and you ##

834
01:19:09,420 --> 01:19:12,617
Hold on!

835
01:19:15,859 --> 01:19:17,884
Doon!

836
01:19:17,961 --> 01:19:20,623
<i>Let's go. Come on.</i>

837
01:19:28,439 --> 01:19:30,964
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

838
01:19:35,379 --> 01:19:39,782
<i># About you and you #

839
01:19:39,850 --> 01:19:42,785
#And you ##

840
01:20:05,876 --> 01:20:08,777
Poppy!

841
01:20:10,013 --> 01:20:12,982
Sul, come on! Now!
We've gotta go now! Come on!

842
01:20:13,050 --> 01:20:16,577
- I've got to keep this open!
- Sul, come now! Come with me!

843
01:20:16,653 --> 01:20:19,520
You go! Now!

844
01:20:22,092 --> 01:20:23,923
It's all right!

845
01:20:33,470 --> 01:20:35,495
Are you okay?

846
01:20:35,572 --> 01:20:39,099
- Okay. Get in!
- Did you see what happened to the first one?

847
01:20:39,176 --> 01:20:41,770
We don't have any choice. Come on!

848
01:20:50,354 --> 01:20:52,288
Hold on, Poppy.

849
01:21:01,298 --> 01:21:03,232
<i>It's lowering.</i>

850
01:21:50,314 --> 01:21:55,013
<i>Mayor Cole?</i>

851
01:21:56,587 --> 01:21:59,317
I made it.

852
01:21:59,389 --> 01:22:03,086
What are you doing?
You can't leave me here!

853
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:05,958
Wait!

854
01:22:16,540 --> 01:22:18,440
No. No!

855
01:22:20,043 --> 01:22:22,944
We had a deal. Wait. Wait!

856
01:22:24,381 --> 01:22:28,112
It was you and me!
Open the door!

857
01:22:28,185 --> 01:22:31,245
We had a deal! We had a deal!

858
01:22:31,321 --> 01:22:34,916
<i>Open the door! Open the door.</i>

859
01:22:34,992 --> 01:22:36,926
<i>Not fair!</i>

860
01:22:36,994 --> 01:22:38,985
<i>You said!</i>

861
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:06,518
<i>Doon, to the right! The right!</i>

862
01:23:06,590 --> 01:23:08,490
I'm trying!

863
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:45,351
- Drop!
<i>- Hold on!</i>

864
01:25:31,001 --> 01:25:33,492
There's something up ahead.

865
01:25:42,913 --> 01:25:44,847
Okay.

866
01:27:04,928 --> 01:27:07,658
They were right.

867
01:27:07,731 --> 01:27:10,063
There's nothing but darkness.

868
01:28:03,687 --> 01:28:05,621
Lina.

869
01:28:28,545 --> 01:28:30,604
It's blue.

870
01:28:42,859 --> 01:28:45,987
<i>Ember! You can see it!</i>

871
01:28:46,062 --> 01:28:48,121
Hello!

872
01:28:48,198 --> 01:28:51,634
They won't hear you.
It's way too far.

873
01:28:51,701 --> 01:28:53,999
Well-Well, we've gotta
tell them somehow.

874
01:28:54,070 --> 01:28:56,334
We need to tell them what's up here.

875
01:28:57,874 --> 01:29:02,004
<i> Lina and Doon</i>
<i>tied their hope to a rock...</i>

876
01:29:02,078 --> 01:29:04,740
<i>and tossed it down toward the city.</i>

877
01:29:12,989 --> 01:29:16,083
<i>The rock could've ended up on a roof.</i>

878
01:29:18,762 --> 01:29:20,753
<i>Or kicked into a gutter.</i>

879
01:29:22,899 --> 01:29:25,390
<i>But fate ran another course.</i>

880
01:29:27,871 --> 01:29:30,669
<i>And the message found its way.</i>

881
01:29:39,249 --> 01:29:41,843
<i>Now the path was clear for all.</i>

882
01:29:44,354 --> 01:29:48,051
<i>All of us who kept</i>
<i>the flame of Ember burning...</i>

883
01:29:48,124 --> 01:29:50,490
<i>through the darkness...</i>

884
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:53,552
<i>so that we could live again</i>
<i>on the earth...</i>

885
01:29:53,630 --> 01:29:56,190
<i>in the air and the light.</i>
