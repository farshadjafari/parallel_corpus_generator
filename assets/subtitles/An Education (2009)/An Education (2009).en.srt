1
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,960
AN EDUCATION

2
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,400
Come on, girls.

3
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,320
Anybody?

4
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,760
Anybody else?

5
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,040
Jenny. Again.

6
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,880
Isn't it because Mr Rochester's blind?

7
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,920
Yes, Jenny.

8
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,280
I've got an English essay to do
by tomorrow morning.

9
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,360
Right.

10
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,840
So the only sound I want to hear
coming through the ceiling...

11
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,640
...is the sound of sweat dripping
onto textbooks.

12
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,200
- Cello?
- No. No cello.

13
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,920
I thought we agreed that
cello was my interest or hobby?

14
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,320
But it's already is your interest
or hobby.

15
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,440
So when they ask you
at the Oxford interview...

16
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,040
"What is your interest or hobby?"

17
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,320
...you can say, "the Cello".
And you won't be lying.

18
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,920
Look, you don't have to
practise a hobby.

19
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,680
A hobby is a hobby.

20
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,760
Can I stop going to the youth
orchestra, then?

21
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,000
No!

22
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,160
No. No. The youth orchestra
is a good thing.

23
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,720
- That shows you're a joiner-inner.
- Yes.

24
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,200
But, I've already joined in.

25
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,000
So now I can stop.

26
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,080
No!

27
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,320
No. Well, that just shows the opposite,
don't you see?

28
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,960
No, that shows you're a rebel.

29
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,280
They don't want that at Oxford.

30
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,560
No. They don't want people
who think for themselves.

31
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,280
No, of course they don't.

32
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,440
Jenny.

33
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,880
Should I wear like,
Sunday best?

34
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,040
You'd better, I'm afraid.

35
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,120
Just to show my father
you're a serious young man...

36
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,600
...not a teddy boy.

37
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,000
Oh, God!

38
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,920
I need to go.
It'll bucket down in a minute.

39
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,600
- Alright...
- I'll see you at the weekend.

40
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,440
- Bye, then.
- Bye.

41
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,120
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

42
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,920
Goodbye, my love.

43
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,720
Come on. Come on.

44
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,800
Stop it, now! Stop it!

45
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,080
<i>Oh no, look what you've done.</i>

46
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,212
- The nice man is waiting for us.
- It fell off.

47
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,920
Hello.

48
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:25,960
Look...

49
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,240
If you had any sense, you wouldn't
take a lift from a strange man.

50
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,440
But I'm a music lover, and I'm
worried about your cello. So...

51
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,240
...what I propose is, you put it
in my car and walk alongside me.

52
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,000
How do I know you won't just
drive off with the cello?

53
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,960
Good point.

54
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,720
How much does a new cello cost?

55
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,720
Ten? Fifteen pounds?
I don't know.

56
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,480
Let's say... fifteen.

57
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,960
No? Alright.

58
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,440
Up to you.

59
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,400
And that.

60
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,520
I'm David, by the way.

61
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,120
- Jenny.
- Very good.

62
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,320
How did the concert go?

63
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,400
It was a rehearsal.
The concert's next Thursday.

64
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,080
- What are you playing?
- Elgar.

65
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,080
I think it's a shame he spent
so much time in Worcester, don't you?

66
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,400
Worcester's too near Birmingham.
And you can hear that in the music.

67
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,600
There's a terrible Brummy accent in there,
if you listen hard enough.

68
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,840
Anyway, Elgar and the Jews
don't mix very well.

69
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,960
I'm not a Jew!

70
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,480
- No. I am.
- Oh!

71
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,680
I wasn't accusing you.

72
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,560
Can I sit in the car
with my cello?

73
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,680
Jump in.

74
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,880
I've never seen a
car like this before.

75
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,040
- It's very chic.
- It's a Bristol.

76
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,640
Not many of them made.

77
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,400
Where to, madam?

78
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,520
Jenny live round the corner.

79
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,840
- Worst luck!
- I'll see what I can do.

80
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,360
I suppose cellists must go to a
lot of concerts.

81
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,360
We don't go to any concerts.

82
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,720
- We don't believe in them.
- Oh, they're real.

83
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,600
So people say.

84
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,680
- Smoke?
- I'd better not.

85
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,280
I live just up there.

86
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,240
Why don't we believe in them?

87
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,040
He'd say there's no point in them.

88
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,440
- Your father, this is?
- Oh, yes.

89
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,320
They're just for fun.

90
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,400
Apart from school concerts,
which are no fun at all,

91
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,080
...so we go to those.

92
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,520
They don't help you get on.

93
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,360
Which of course is what is so
wonderful about them.

94
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,320
Anyway, you'll go one day.

95
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,000
I know. I will.

96
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,280
If I get to University...

97
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,160
I'm going to read what I want...

98
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,400
...and listen to what I want.

99
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,720
And I'm going to look at paintings
and watch French films...

100
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,240
...and I'm gonna talk to people
who know lots about lots.

101
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,840
- Good for you.
- Yes.

102
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,320
- Which University?
- Oxford. If I'm lucky.

103
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,040
Did you go anywhere?

104
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,040
I studied at what I believe they
call the University of Life.

105
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,040
I didn't get a very good degree there.

106
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,920
Well, thank you for driving me home.

107
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,640
- You alright? You got it?
- Yes, it's fine.

108
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,640
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

109
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,960
<b>Sous le ciel de Paris
performed by Juliette Greco</b>

110
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,000
<i>I don't want to hear
any French singing.</i>

111
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,320
<i>French singing wasn't on the syllabus,
last time I looked.</i>

112
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,400
- Battenberg?
- Oh, thank you.

113
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,880
So where are you applying, Graham?

114
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,760
I'm not sure yet.

115
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,680
When will you be sure?

116
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,680
You can't let the grass grow
under your feet, young man.

117
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,040
- I might take a year off.
- What for?

118
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,200
I don't know yet.

119
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,680
Maybe do some travelling, yeah,
that sort of thing.

120
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,840
Travelling?

121
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,240
What are you, a teddy boy?

122
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,040
You know she's going to Oxford,
don't you?

123
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,120
If we can get her Latin
up to scratch.

124
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,360
So while she's studying
English at Oxford...

125
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,800
...you'll be the wandering Jew.

126
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,920
Mr Mellor, I'm not a teddy boy.

127
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,040
I'm... I'm a, uh,
serious man. Young.

128
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,840
No... yeah.

129
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,200
A young man serious...
man.

130
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,760
- They're for me!
- Who are they from?

131
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,920
- Gosh! Him.
- What's this?

132
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,120
Jack, I'm afraid Jenny's been
sent some flowers from a chap.

133
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,400
- A chap? What kind of chap?
- He's wishing me luck for tonight.

134
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,600
Are you sure that's all
he's wishing you?

135
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,800
Where did he get the money from?

136
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,080
- He earns it, I expect.
- Earns it? Why isn't he in school?

137
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,520
I don't... can we just go?

138
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,600
Otherwise the good-luck flowers will
actually be responsible for me...

139
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,640
...actually missing the concert.

140
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,120
Which would be ironic, isn't it?

141
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,760
- I... I don't like it
- Objection noted.

142
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,360
- Jenny?
- Noted.

143
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,680
Yeah, well... it's gotta be ten bob's
worth of luck here, I mean...

144
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,840
That's a bit much
for a schoolgirl, isn't it?

145
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,280
Oh, we can't leave it here.

146
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,600
I mean, I'd burgle a house
with flowers left outside.

147
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,200
They'll think we're made of money.

148
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,080
Thank you, Marjorie.

149
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,760
<i>Camus doesn't want you to like him.</i>

150
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,480
<i>Feeling is bourgeois.</i>

151
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,200
<i>Being engagee is bourgeois.</i>

152
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,800
He kills someone
and he doesn't feel anything.

153
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,480
His mother dies
and he doesn't feel anything.

154
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,200
I wouldn't feel anything
if my mother dies.

155
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,120
Does that make me an
existentialist?

156
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,120
No. That just makes you a cow.

157
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,640
A cow.

158
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,360
Well...

159
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,040
After I've been to the university...

160
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,880
I'm going to be French.

161
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,480
And I'm going to Paris...

162
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,480
...and I'm going to smoke and wear black
and listen to Jacques Brel.

163
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,760
And I won't speak. Ever.

164
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,280
- Oh, cranky!
- What?

165
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,840
<i>Wait, here.</i>

166
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,680
Hello?

167
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,640
Hello!

168
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,680
Hello. Thank you.

169
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,120
How did it go?

170
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,560
Fine. I think.

171
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,960
Well, I didn't mess my bit up.

172
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,480
Nobody got thrown out
of the orchestra afterwards.

173
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,720
Always the mark of a cultural triumph.

174
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,480
Listen. I'm glad I ran into you.
What are you doing on Friday?

175
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,120
- Going to school.
- I meant the evening.

176
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,240
Oh, of course. Nothing.

177
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,360
Because I'm going to listen to
some Ravel in St. John's Smith Square.

178
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,200
My friends Danny and Helen
would be coming too,

179
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,160
...so it wouldn't be, uh...

180
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,320
I tell you what.

181
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,800
I'll come and pick you up...

182
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,320
...and if your mother and
father disapprove,

183
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,000
...then you can have the tickets
and go with one of them.

184
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,000
- How does that sound?
- Thank you.

185
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,560
And I'd like to go with you.

186
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,280
Seven?

187
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,320
Okay, fine.

188
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,640
And probably go for
a spot of supper afterwards.

189
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,480
- Supper?
- Hm, if you want to.

190
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,960
Well, the thing is that...
we probably would have eaten.

191
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,400
Well, if you'd like supper,
then perhaps on friday...

192
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,000
...you could, uh, not eat?

193
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,880
Yes. Of course.

194
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,400
A spot of supper?
- You've heard of supper?

195
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,240
<i>We've heard of it.
But we've never eaten it.</i>

196
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,000
<i>So, you're gonna have to
tell us everything.</i>

197
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,600
<i>Otherwise, it's not fair.</i>

198
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,280
I won't allow it!
- Fine.

199
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,000
He's more than happy
for you to take me.

200
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,360
Fine. I will.

201
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,040
- Good.
- Well, where is it?

202
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,640
- St. John's Smith Square.
- Where's that?

203
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,280
I don't know.
I'm sure we could find out.

204
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,680
It's in Westminster.
Right next to the Abbey.

205
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,960
How did you know that?

206
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,080
I had a life before we were
married, you know?

207
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,680
- He soon put a stop to that.
- Well, there we are.

208
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,760
- Where are we?
- We're near Westminster Abbey.

209
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,200
I'm not going all the way over there.

210
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,480
The trouble is, that's where
St. John's Smith Square is.

211
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,800
There must be something on locally.
Where's the paper?

212
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,600
She wants to see someone
who can play.

213
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,520
She doesn't want to see
Sheila Kirkland scratching away.

214
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,320
I'll take her.

215
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,400
And how do you propose to get there?
RAF helicopter?

216
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,280
- That's him.
- Oh, bloody hell.

217
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,200
Jack!

218
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,520
By the way, David's a Jew.
A wandering Jew.

219
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,360
So watch yourself.

220
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,600
What did she mean by that?

221
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,320
I've never said anything like that!
It's just an expression!

222
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,600
Look, I got nothing against the Jews...

223
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,480
I'm glad to hear it.
Hello.

224
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,520
No, I didn't mean that
I got against you..

225
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,840
- No, of course I do mean that.
- Dad!

226
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,640
No, it's that... sorry,
it's just that...

227
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,520
You're not the sort of person
that I'd be against,

228
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,960
But I wouldn't because...

229
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,880
I'm not the kind of person
who would be against...

230
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,720
...people.

231
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,080
I'm Jack, and
this is my wife Marjorie.

232
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,160
You didn't tell me
you had a sister, Jenny.

233
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,040
Please.

234
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,400
You're a lucky man, Jack.

235
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,920
Yes, I suppose I'm.

236
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,520
This is lovely.
- Thank you.

237
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,040
I'm sorry.
David, would you like a drink?

238
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,000
I'd love one, Jack,
but we're running a little late.

239
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,440
If Jenny's ready,
perhaps we'll shoot off.

240
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,400
Actually, David, Dad has something
he has to tell you.

241
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,880
No, no, really...

242
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,880
It... It was just a question.

243
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,240
Point of reference.

244
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:27,120
What's the best way to get to
St. John's Smith square from here?

245
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,320
It's a pretty straight run, really.

246
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,360
Up to Hammersmith, take the A4
through Kensington and you're there.

247
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,640
- Simple as that?
- Simple as that.

248
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,360
- Shall I book us some tickets?
- No.

249
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,280
But... have her back by ten, David.

250
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,880
I was hoping she might come
with me afterwards...

251
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,200
...for a spot of supper
with my aunt Helen.

252
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,160
Oh, well...

253
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,680
No... no, no.
She's usually in bed by then.

254
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,520
What if I promise to have
her back by eleven thirty?

255
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,440
Well, it's Friday night.

256
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,200
And you're going all the way
to the West End...

257
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,480
Thanks, Jack.
I appreciate it.

258
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,320
Alright.

259
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,000
- Bye.
- Bye.

260
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,560
Have a nice time.

261
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,960
Hello. Hello.

262
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,040
Are we late?

263
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,960
No, I thought we're going to
miss the beginning,

264
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,120
...and then it wouldn't be
worth going in,

265
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,920
...and we could go off dancing
or something.

266
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,720
Helen is one of the more reluctant
members of tonight's audience.

267
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,360
Hello.

268
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,440
Jenny, these are my friends
Helen and Danny.

269
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,600
Shall we?

270
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,320
Fine.

271
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,680
I'm sorry.

272
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,600
- That's alright. It's nice, isn't it?
- It's beautiful.

273
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,400
<i>- Where did you get it from?
- Oh, in Chelsea somewhere.</i>

274
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,840
Oh, yours is...

275
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,080
Well, it's good for
this sort of concert, isn't it?

276
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,800
Thank you.

277
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,120
We should go shopping together
one day, you and I, if you want.

278
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,440
That would be nice.

279
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,200
But Chelsea... C'est beaucoup
trop cher pour moi.

280
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,160
Sorry?

281
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,800
I just said, um,
it's too expensive for me.

282
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:24,960
No, you didn't.

283
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,560
You said something
completely different.

284
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,720
No, well...
I said it in French.

285
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,440
In French? Why?

286
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,040
I don't know.

287
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,760
Well, Chelsea is too expensive
for me too, really.

288
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,600
But, we don't have to
worry about that.

289
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,240
If you want something in Chelsea,
just get David to take you shopping.

290
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,720
Why would David want to
take me shopping?

291
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,680
I've booked a table at Juliette's.

292
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,960
Will that kill the mood,
do you think?

293
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,520
Oh, I hope so.

294
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,280
God, I always think
I'm going to my own funeral...

295
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,280
...when I listen to classical music.

296
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,880
- That was classical, wasn't it?
- Yes. Very classical.

297
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,120
- As classical as you can get.
- Juliette's it is, then.

298
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,600
Heaven forbid that we'd end the evening
reflecting on our own mortality.

299
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,120
<i> I want a Sunday kind of love </i>

300
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:12,080
<i> A love to last past Saturday night </i>

301
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,680
Extraordinary woman right there,
just like you, Helen.

302
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,360
What about "Chante Francoise Sagan"?
Have you heard that one?

303
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,520
- It's wonderful
- I've only got...

304
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,440
Well, I think it's just called
"Juliette Greco".

305
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,240
The one with the eyes
on the sleeve.

306
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,120
I saved up and got my
French conversation teacher...

307
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,520
...to bring it back
after Christmas.

308
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,520
You've got a French
conversation teacher?

309
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,000
- Yes.
- Is that why you suddenly speak French...

310
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,320
...for no reason?

311
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,640
You never heard her sing?

312
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,880
She's marvellous.
You'd see her in Paris then, not here.

313
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,480
David will take you.

314
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,360
I'd love to.
You'd fit right in.

315
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,600
Better than here, really.

316
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,800
Isn't it wonderful to find a young person
who wants to know things?

317
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,400
There's so much
I want you to see.

318
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,520
Are you alright to come
and have a look at that...

319
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,920
...Pembroke Villas place
with me on Friday, Danny?

320
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,320
Oh, no. I can't.

321
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,760
There's a Burne-Jones coming up
at Christie's on Friday.

322
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,240
Desperate to get my hands on it.

323
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,600
You're thinking of buying
a Burne-Jones?

324
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,280
A real one?

325
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,760
I just had a feeling that the
pre-Raphaelites are going to take off.

326
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,600
I love the pre-Raphaelites.

327
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,360
- Do you?
- Yes, of course.

328
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,080
Um, Rossetti and
Burne-Jones, anyway.

329
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,880
Not Holman Hunt, so much.
He's so garish.

330
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,720
Oh, absolutely!

331
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,400
Well, why don't we all go
to the auction together?

332
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,920
Auction?
Gosh! How exciting!

333
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,760
Next Friday morning.

334
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,720
Friday, oh.

335
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,320
You're busy?

336
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,040
- Yes.
- Too bad.

337
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,360
What a pity!
It's no problem.

338
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,560
- Are you sure you're busy?
- No.

339
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,200
I'm sure I could re-arrange.

340
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,440
That would be lovely.

341
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:19,880
<i> You got me wrapped around
your little finger </i>

342
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:30,600
<i> If this is love, it's everything
I hoped it would be </i>

343
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:44,080
<i> When we kiss,
it's as if our lips agree </i>

344
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:50,320
<i> That we were meant to be </i>

345
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,720
<i> When we touch, it's too much </i>

346
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,520
What are you doing?

347
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,960
I can't get this
casserole dish clean.

348
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,920
It's all burnt round...

349
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,000
It's twenty-five to twelve.

350
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,480
- We finish tea at seven.
- I know what the time is.

351
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,120
How was your evening?

352
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,240
The best night of my life.

353
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,360
Good night, Mom.

354
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,400
<i>I can think of two violins,
one cello,</i>

355
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,760
...two violas, a harp.

356
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,480
I don't want to hear about Ravel.

357
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,400
I want to know what else
was on the program.

358
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,800
Oh, there was nothing like that.
He was a perfect gentleman.

359
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,080
He just said he wanted to take me
places and show me things.

360
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,840
- Things?
- Plural? My God!

361
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,120
I knew that "Jane Eyre" would
eventually work its magic upon you.

362
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,320
I'm assuming that's what
you're so animated about.

363
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,520
Of course.

364
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,960
- "Jane Eyre" and Jenny's new boyfriend.
- He's not my "new boyfriend".

365
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,800
Oh, sorry. He's more a
man-friend actually.

366
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,600
- He's got a sports car, Ms. Stubbs.
- It's maroon.

367
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,400
So could we call him, uh,
Mr. Rochester figure?

368
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,440
I think he must be
as blind as Mr. Rochester.

369
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,800
You may or may not have noticed,
I'm trying to stir the subject away...

370
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,360
...from Jenny's lurid love-life
and into the matter in hand.

371
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,120
And it's clear from this evidence...

372
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,960
...that most of you know
far too much about the former...

373
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,920
...and next to nothing
about the latter.

374
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,520
Reluctantly, I have to admit that
Jenny is clearly an expert on both.

375
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,600
Excellent as always, Jenny.

376
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,000
Hello.
- Hello.

377
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,000
- Hello.
- Hello.

378
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,320
Any further bids?

379
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,800
Sold them for 60 guineas.

380
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,480
- Hello.
- You're late.

381
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,960
<i>We now turn to lot 41.</i>

382
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,160
<i>"The Tree of Forgiveness"
by Sir Edward Burne-Jones.</i>

383
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:28,320
This is a rare opportunity to purchase
a key work of the Pre-Raphaelite movement.

384
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,320
- Who will start me off at 100 guineas?
- Is it that one?

385
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,920
Yes, that's the one.

386
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,040
<i>Fifty guineas?</i>

387
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,920
Twenty guineas?

388
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,680
Thank you.

389
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,160
Forty?

390
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,600
Thank you.

391
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,360
Do I hear sixty?

392
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,680
Eighty guineas?

393
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,080
Thank you, sir.

394
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,480
Another one, one hundred guineas?

395
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,720
One hundred and twenty?

396
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,760
No further bids?

397
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,440
Your turn.

398
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,520
- What?
- Any further bids?

399
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,440
- Any more?
- Quick!

400
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,800
One hundred and twenty guineas from
the very eager new bidder.

401
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,600
One hundred and forty, madam?
Thank you.

402
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,200
One hundred and sixty.

403
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,640
One hundred and eighty.
Thank you.

404
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,840
Two hundred guineas?

405
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,960
Two hundred and twenty?

406
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,400
Another one, madam?

407
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,120
Sold for two hundred guineas.
Thank you.

408
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,520
Your name, please?

409
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,360
Mellor.

410
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,640
<i>Now we move on to lot 42.</i>

411
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,680
Thank you very much.

412
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,920
I couldn't have possibly
bought it without you.

413
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,840
<i>Just a couple of years ago, you'd
pick one of them for fifty quid.</i>

414
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,520
<i>- No one was interested.
- Oh, I'd have been so interested.</i>

415
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,240
As you can see,
I just love things.

416
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,840
That's not a Lockey-Hill!

417
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,080
There aren't many people
who come in here and say that.

418
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,680
- Certainly not me.
- Oh, it's beautiful.

419
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,880
- Do you play?
- I used to.

420
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,480
I vowed to myself that
one day I'd own one of these.

421
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,320
And now I do,
I want to never touch it.

422
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,600
It's vulgar really,
putting it on display.

423
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,760
- Give it to Jenny.
- Huh?

424
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,880
- I think that would be even more vulgar.
- Play for us, Jenny.

425
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,000
No. I mean, one day.
When I'm good enough.

426
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:26,080
- Oh, she's good enough now.
- David, you've never seen me play.

427
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,120
I can come and hear you in Oxford,
when you get there.

428
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,320
We should all go and spend
a weekend in Oxford.

429
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,760
Straw boaters...

430
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,280
- punting, cream teas, anti...
- Boats?

431
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,520
...quarian bookshops.

432
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,160
Bit of business, if we can find it.

433
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,920
What about next weekend?

434
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,680
Yes.

435
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,160
I wouldn't be allowed to do that.

436
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,160
I'll talk to them.

437
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,760
You're going to ask my father...

438
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,720
...if you can take me away
for the weekend?

439
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,400
- He'd have you arrested.
- We'll see.

440
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,320
- I bet you can't.
- How much?

441
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,280
I'd be careful, if I were you, Jenny.

442
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,120
You don't know
who you're dealing with.

443
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,720
Half-a-crown.

444
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,720
You're on.

445
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,680
How do you know Danny?

446
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,120
Oh, you know.

447
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,400
We kept bumping into each other,

448
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,880
...and we became pals,

449
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,960
...ended up doing a bit of business
together, when it suits us.

450
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,640
What kind of business?

451
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,200
Property. A bit of art dealing.

452
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,480
Some buying and selling.
This and that...

453
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,800
Alright, just be two ticks.
- Okay.

454
00:28:46,828 --> 00:28:48,875
Mr. Goldman,
good to see you.

455
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,280
Madam. Alright.

456
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,080
- Alright, I got this one. And, um...
- Put me down.

457
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,000
Go on, then.

458
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,800
Sorry about that.

459
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,560
- How do you know those Negro people?
- They're clients.

460
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,160
Clients?

461
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,680
Schwarzers have to live somewhere.

462
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,400
It's not as if they can rent off
their own kind, is it?

463
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,640
Test results for the Virgil translation.

464
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,840
We'll start from the bottom...

465
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,440
Patricia.

466
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,200
Absent.

467
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,240
Margaret.

468
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,680
48%.

469
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,000
Jenny.

470
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,000
52%.

471
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,280
That would just about scrape
a pass in the exam proper.

472
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,600
Not good enough for
Oxford candidates.

473
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,240
It's her Latin, isn't it?

474
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,600
Everyone's doing their best, Jack.

475
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,000
But what if everyone's best
isn't good enough?

476
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,960
What do we do then? Hm?

477
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,160
Well, perhaps the whole thing's
been a waste of money anyway.

478
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,160
You don't mean that.

479
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,720
Well, what's she going to do with
an English degree?

480
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,600
And if she's going to spend three years
playing that bloody cello...

481
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,960
...talking in French
to a bunch of... beatniks,

482
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,520
Well, I'm... I'm just throwing
good money after bad.

483
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,520
I wish she might meet
a nice lawyer.

484
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,880
But she could do that
at a dinner dance tomorrow.

485
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,960
Oh, that's the point of
an Oxford education. Isn't it, Dad?

486
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,680
It's the expensive alternative
to a dinner dance.

487
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,080
What about private tuition?

488
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,720
Can anybody hear me?
How much this is going to cost me?

489
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,320
Five shillings an hour.
Maybe a little more for A-level.

490
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,520
Five bob! We'll spend five bob here,
we'll spend five bob there,

491
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,200
...and next thing we know that's
our savings down the drain.

492
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,760
And what else are we spending
five bob on?

493
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,480
What else are we
spending six pence on?

494
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,000
Oh, nothing? No, nothing!
All of this is free.

495
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,720
This vase... is free.

496
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,680
It was, actually.
It was a present from Auntie Vi.

497
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,080
That chair, this sofa...
it's all free.

498
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,520
We don't have to pay for
any of it.

499
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,040
You see, that's
the beauty of life, Jenny.

500
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,920
You don't have to pay for anything.

501
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,800
You know, there's a lovely
Oxford tree growing in the garden.

502
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,360
Lucky for you, because
that's Oxford taken care of.

503
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,720
And there's a whole orchard
of school trees.

504
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,040
So that school is free.

505
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,520
And I think there's even a
private tuition tree in there.

506
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,320
- I'll just go and check, shall I?
- Jack?

507
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,440
Oh, that's alright, Marjorie.
Don't worry, I'll be in a second.

508
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,880
Because I think
there's a whole clump of them...

509
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,160
...surrounding the pocket
money tree.

510
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,600
I'll just go and make sure
they're all nice and safe, shall I?

511
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,920
Oh, by the way,
you might be lucky.

512
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,720
There might be a man
with deep pockets growing out there.

513
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,240
Because God know
you gonna need one.

514
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,960
Well, you can always go to
secretarial college with Hattie.

515
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,960
- Oh, thanks.
- Charming!

516
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,920
- Oh, God, no.
- Hello.

517
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,680
Hello... Graham.

518
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,600
I haven't seen you in ages.

519
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,680
It all went wrong, didn't it?
The, uh...

520
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,760
The tea-party, I mean.

521
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,720
Was it because of the
year off thing?

522
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,040
- Because I...
- No.

523
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,680
I just have so much work to do...

524
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,280
...if I'm gonna get the grades
I need.

525
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,840
Yeah. She doesn't have time for boys.

526
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,200
- Bye, Graham.
- Bye.

527
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:29,520
- Oh, he does all the Goons.
- No, my Eccles is no good.

528
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,120
- Oh, no, you've got him.
- No, no...

529
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,000
Hello?

530
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,520
Oh, Jenny...

531
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,800
...David does the most
fantastic Bluebottle.

532
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,320
You came to see my parents?

533
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,320
Oh, why is that so hard to imagine?

534
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,000
Why are you drinking?

535
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,840
It's not Christmas!

536
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,840
Well, there's a lot you don't know
about us, young lady.

537
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,640
- We had a life before you came along.
- Hm, that's true.

538
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,720
I'm only going on what I've seen
over the last sixteen years.

539
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:59,520
I'm trying to think what you missed.
Nothing much comes to mind.

540
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,960
Anyway, I've got a huge pile
of Latin translation to do.

541
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,560
You didn't tell us
David went to Oxford.

542
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,760
No... I didn't.

543
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,120
For all the good it did me.

544
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,800
- Isn't that funny?
- Extraordinary!

545
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,960
I was just telling Jack that
I'm going back next weekend.

546
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,560
I go and visit my old English professor
every now and again.

547
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:26,040
See, that's what you need, Jenny.
Someone on the inside track.

548
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,280
It's not always what you know,
is it, David?

549
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,280
Too true.

550
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,160
- Have you ever come across Clive Lewis?
- Dad's never come across anyone.

551
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,800
He wrote a children's book called...

552
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,880
"The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe"
that did very well, I believe.

553
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,240
C. S. Lewis?

554
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,600
Well, to us he was just the old codger
who taught Medieval literature.

555
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,000
But I came to know him very well.

556
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,480
We just... got along.

557
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,480
Jenny used to devour those books.

558
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,920
I'd love to meet him.

559
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,400
I'm sorry.
Am I being slow on the uptake?

560
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,720
Would Jenny like to come
with me at the weekend?

561
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,880
No, not this weekend.
But sometimes, perhaps.

562
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,080
Yes.

563
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,400
How often do you see him?

564
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:15,200
Not very often,
every couple of years.

565
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,840
- Maybe next time.
- Huh...

566
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,360
Well, I suppose...

567
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,320
Would she have to stay the night?

568
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:29,920
I wouldn't recommend driving home
after one of those Oxford dinners.

569
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,040
Clive could get her a room at the college.
That's easy enough.

570
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,600
Seems like too good an
opportunity to pass up.

571
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,400
It wouldn't be a bother,
would it, David?

572
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,040
<i> We walk along hand in hand </i>

573
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,720
Come on!

574
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,320
Just putting a few things into the bag.
Don't worry.

575
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,400
<i> Yeah, we both understand </i>

576
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,120
<i> Ummm, Sweet Nothin's </i>

577
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,600
Come on!

578
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,880
We're nearly ready.
Be there in two ticks.

579
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,960
How can they only be
nearly ready?

580
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,800
I wouldn't be surprised
if three of them come out there.

581
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,760
That's the only explanation.
They're making themselves a friend.

582
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,160
Ladies! Come on, let's go!

583
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,120
There. Have a look in the corner.
Open the door.

584
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,360
You should keep that one
if you want to.

585
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,760
I can only wear so many on one day.

586
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,080
Thank you.

587
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,560
What about tonight?
We got to put on a nightie.

588
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,920
Would David share the room with you?

589
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,400
Oh, you haven't slept with him?

590
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,360
No.

591
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,680
Good for you.

592
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,880
- Really? Do you think so?
- Yes.

593
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,040
Well, you're only sixteen.
You don't want to get pregnant, do you?

594
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,240
No, I wouldn't...
I wouldn't let that happen.

595
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,000
I want to wait till
I'm seventeen.

596
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,080
On my seventeenth
birthday, hopefully.

597
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,400
With David?

598
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,000
Oh Golly, it will be with David,
won't it?

599
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,440
If that's what you want.

600
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,720
Anyway, I'll find you a nightie.

601
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,120
Ta-da!

602
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,920
Should we make a move?

603
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:25,920
<i> You got me wrapped around
your little finger </i>

604
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:34,400
<i> If this is love, it's everything
I hoped it would be </i>

605
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,600
Can we get off
and have a look around?

606
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,160
Later.
If we have time.

607
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,040
- Imagine spending three years here.
- Oh, I know.

608
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,560
Why university girls are
strange-looking?

609
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,040
They can't all have started off
that way, can they?

610
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,000
Well, most girls aren't born ugly,

611
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,800
...but most girl students
seems to be. So...

612
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,760
...there must be something
about those places that make you...

613
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,600
...fat, or spotty, or short-sighted.

614
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,640
Well, if you look at it like that,
I mean...

615
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,240
...that's proper scientific analysis.
You can't argue with science.

616
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,760
I still don't quite understand what
you want to do when you get here.

617
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,600
I want to read English.

618
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,600
Books?

619
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,840
- Sorry?
- You want to read English books?

620
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,880
Reading English is just
another way of saying...

621
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,240
Don't worry, Jenny.
You're wasting your breath.

622
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,160
Tomorrow we'll get
more of a feel for the place.

623
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,480
Absolutely.

624
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,920
This place would be good
for a little business.

625
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,480
- All those little old ladies wandering around.
- Old ladies?

626
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,400
- I'll bet this place is rife with stats.
- Please explain what stats are.

627
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,080
You're always going on
about them.

628
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,800
- It isn't very interesting.
- But you two are interested.

629
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,600
Because we are not
very interesting either.

630
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,200
- Oh, no. They're not, really.
- True.

631
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,800
So we have an idiot here,
to save us from ourselves.

632
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,080
Yeah, to put some intelligence
and culture to our brutal lives.

633
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,240
Sing to us! Sing to us!

634
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,280
Please don't make me
sing to you.

635
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,160
Please don't make us
talk about work.

636
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,880
So...

637
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:14,480
Now, is he Clive,
do you think? Or CS?

638
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,520
I'm confused now.
I thought you'd made him up?

639
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,120
No, we...

640
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,520
Never mind.

641
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,960
"To dear Jenny. "

642
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,760
"With the pleasure
of meeting you. "

643
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,920
"Come and see me
again soon. Clive. "

644
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,480
Dirty old man.

645
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,040
Bad girl.

646
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,520
We've got these exact
same curtains at home.

647
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,000
Let's not talk about curtains.

648
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,160
You look beautiful.

649
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,760
- David...
- Hm?

650
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,880
There's something you should know.

651
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,280
I'm a virgin.

652
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,920
And I want to stay that way
until I'm seventeen.

653
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,440
I think that's good.

654
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,880
I think that's right.

655
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,040
We can still be romantic,
can't we?

656
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,920
Yes, of course.

657
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,440
- As long as it's not actually...
- Minnie.

658
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,400
Is that me?

659
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,120
Yes.

660
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,840
You're my Minnie Mouse...

661
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,440
...and I'm your bubbalub.

662
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:53,160
Okay... if that's what
you want to do.

663
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,000
- Minnie.
- Yes, David?

664
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,280
Bubbalub.

665
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,320
Bubbalub.

666
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,600
May I have a look?

667
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,040
Just a peek.

668
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,480
You just want to see them?

669
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,040
Thank you.

670
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,040
I think there's a house for sale
around here.

671
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,320
Really?

672
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,760
- Might be worth a look.
- Hm-hmm.

673
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,080
Jenny?

674
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,160
- Aren't you coming?
- We don't go in.

675
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,800
What are you talking about?

676
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,200
Why don't you go and get
a nice cup of tea somewhere?

677
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,480
Helen will look after you.

678
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,680
I don't need looking after,
thank you very much.

679
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,080
- David?
- I'm not gonna tell you a second time.

680
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,920
Run along.

681
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,600
Oh, they won't be long.
Either way.

682
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,200
Either way?

683
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:05,080
Well, sometimes they find something,
sometimes they don't.

684
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,520
And when they do find something,

685
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,800
...we often have to leave
quite quickly.

686
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,680
They can be quite naughty,
sometimes.

687
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,160
Thank you.
- Bye.

688
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,840
- See you around.
- Catch!

689
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,640
Careful! Careful! Careful!

690
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,000
Come on.

691
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,600
- Helen.
- Pass the ball.

692
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,080
Good.

693
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,880
Jenny!

694
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,320
- What?
- You can stand there if you like,

695
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,160
...but I won't recommend it.

696
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,880
Cooee!

697
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,680
Jenny?

698
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,000
Sorry about being a little brisk
back there, Jenny.

699
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,720
It's just the way we do things.

700
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,280
Silly, really.

701
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,920
Hey, don't forget your case.

702
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,520
Who's coming up for a drink?

703
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,960
- Jenny?
- No.

704
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,200
You go. I'll make my
own way home.

705
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,240
Jenny?

706
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,080
Jenny!

707
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,240
It's an old map.
A speed.

708
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,000
Poor dear didn't even know
what it was.

709
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,200
It's a waste.
It shouldn't spend its life...

710
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:57,400
...on a wall in wherever
the hell we were.

711
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:00,560
It should be with us.
We have to to look after it properly.

712
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,680
- We liberated it.
- Liberated!

713
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,040
That's one word for it.

714
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:07,200
Don't be bourgeois, Jenny.
You're better than that.

715
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,280
You drink everything
I put in front of you down in one...

716
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:15,440
...and you slam your glass down
on the bar and ask for more.

717
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,480
It's wonderful.

718
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,400
We're not clever like you,
so we've to be clever in other ways,

719
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:25,800
...because if we weren't,
there would be no fun.

720
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:29,600
We have to be clever with maps,
and... and...

721
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,880
You want to know
what stats are?

722
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:35,280
Stats are old ladies who are
scared of coloured people.

723
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,960
So we move the coloureds in
and the old ladies move out...

724
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:42,040
...and I buy their flats cheap.
That's what I do.

725
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,840
So now you know.

726
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,240
And...

727
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,240
...if you don't like it,

728
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,200
I will understand,

729
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,320
...and you can go back
to Twickenham...

730
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,080
...and listen to the
Home Service...

731
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,800
...and do your
Latin homework.

732
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,560
But these weekends, and
the restaurants and the concerts...

733
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,160
They don't grow on trees.

734
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,480
This is who we are, Jenny.

735
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,760
That's nice.

736
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,000
- Come on, you two.
- Come on, up!

737
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,000
You can have my olive.

738
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:57,520
Come on.

739
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,080
I suppose you have
homework to do.

740
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,440
You've no idea how boring
everything was before I met you.

741
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:32,160
Action is character,
our English teacher says.

742
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:35,200
I think it means that
if we never did anything,

743
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,200
...we wouldn't be anybody.

744
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:41,040
And I never did anything
before I met you.

745
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:46,160
And sometimes I think no one's ever done
anything in this whole stupid country,

746
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,080
...apart from you.

747
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,200
- Okay.
- Alright.

748
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,160
There you go.

749
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,360
Good night.

750
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,120
Marjorie, look at this.

751
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,600
"Clive"... lucky girl.

752
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,560
Never a dull moment with David, eh?

753
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,560
Better than that young man
you brought home for tea.

754
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,560
David's a lot older
than Graham.

755
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,360
Graham could live to be
two hundred years old,

756
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,200
...you'll never see him swanning
around with famous authors.

757
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:06,200
Hasn't got it in him.

758
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,360
Graham might become
a famous author, for all you know.

759
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,760
Becoming one
isn't the same as knowing one.

760
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,760
That shows you're well connected.

761
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:15,120
Very impressive young man,
your David.

762
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:19,000
I must admit, life's a
little brighter with him around.

763
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,320
What the hell are those?

764
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,120
Russian Sobranies.

765
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:34,800
Where did they come from?

766
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:38,160
She probably bought them from
the Savoy, or Claridges...

767
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,920
...or the opera,
or some fancy nightclub.

768
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,600
Who knows, with Jenny?

769
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,120
Paris. You can't buy them here.

770
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,600
- You never bought them yourself?
- No. I never.

771
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:50,160
Shut up, you stuck-up cow!

772
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:54,800
But I'll bring you some back,
if you like?

773
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,120
- You're joking?
- No.

774
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,880
- He's taking you to Paris?
- Yes.

775
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:02,480
- This term?
- May be.

776
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,040
Wait.

777
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,000
Isn't it your birthday
next Thursday?

778
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:08,560
Might be.

779
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,320
Oh, my God! Your birthday!

780
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,320
I would not like to be you.

781
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,040
All those supper's
you've had off him.

782
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,280
Ouch!

783
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,240
You've such a Victorian attitude
to sex, you two.

784
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:22,040
Your parents wouldn't let you
swan off like that, would they?

785
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,640
Well, he haven't told them yet.

786
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,080
But David will come up with some story,
he usually does.

787
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,760
Yeah, I've noticed that.

788
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,200
Chanel perfume,
Chanel perfume.

789
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:31,680
Chanel lipstick,
Chanel lipstick.

790
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,960
Those funny cigarettes
you were smoking. Sobranies.

791
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,560
Ten packets each.

792
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,040
How much is that Chanel perfume?

793
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:42,960
Are you the girl going to Paris
or are you not? Because...

794
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:49,440
Tina, top button.

795
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:55,120
Jenny, the headmistress
wants a word with you.

796
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,560
The, uh, legend Mr. Rochester may have
travelled further than you intended.

797
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:00,920
Come.

798
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,000
Ms. Mellor.

799
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,320
We're all very excited about...

800
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,000
...your forthcoming trip to Paris.

801
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:16,000
Our excitement, indeed,
knows no bounds.

802
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,600
Some of us can talk of little else.

803
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,760
An older man, I understand.

804
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,480
A word of warning, Ms. Mellor.

805
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,720
There may well have been the odd...

806
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:32,480
...sixth-form girl who has lost...

807
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,600
...an important part of herself,
perhaps the best part.

808
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,880
while under our supervision.
These things happen, regrettably.

809
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,480
If, however, we are made aware
of that loss, then...

810
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:41,880
...of course the young lady in question...

811
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,480
...would have to continue
her studies elsewhere,

812
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:46,200
...if she still has any use
for A-levels.

813
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,920
Do I make myself clear?

814
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,120
- Can I go now?
- If you want.

815
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,920
What are you doing in there?

816
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,760
Well, I imagine she's lighting
the candles on my cake.

817
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:10,360
You're seventeen
not two hundred and fifty.

818
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,440
- Thanks for inviting me.
- Oh, it was Marjorie's idea, not mine.

819
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,000
- Not even Jenny's for that matter.
- Dad!

820
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:27,400
Well, blow them out,
before the house burns down.

821
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:29,480
Wait up!
Okay, don't wait.

822
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:30,800
Bravo.

823
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,040
- Who'd like a piece?
- Me, please.

824
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,760
Come on. Come on.
Presents.

825
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,560
What's that?

826
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,840
It's a new Latin dictionary.

827
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,120
Thank you.
I needed a new one.

828
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,600
Oh dear.

829
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,040
Snap!

830
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,640
Oh, good grief!

831
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,160
- Jenny, you'd see this.
- It's a special day.

832
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:17,520
- She's a special girl.
- I know it.

833
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:21,400
Bit of help?

834
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,760
Makes your dictionary look
a bit feeble, eh, Graham?

835
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:24,600
Gosh!

836
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:25,760
These are for you.

837
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,520
- Hello, young man.
- Oh, David...

838
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:31,280
- David, would you like a drink?
- I'd love one.

839
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,120
I'd better be going because...

840
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:36,480
...I have a stack of
homework to do, so...

841
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,160
Thank you.

842
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:40,880
- Bye.
- See you.

843
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:43,120
- Goodbye, Mr. Mellor.
- See you, young man.

844
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,400
Thank you.

845
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,040
Wonderful to see you, Graham.

846
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:50,680
- Goodbye, Jenny.
- Bye, Graham.

847
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,880
- Little something warming?
- You know me so well.

848
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:57,880
- Can I open anything yet?
- Wait for me.

849
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:00,160
Before you open that lot,
I got a surprise.

850
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,680
Next weekend, we're all going
to Cafe de Flore...

851
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,280
...to celebrate Jenny's
birthday.

852
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,640
Lovely.

853
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:10,360
Cafe de Flore is in the Boulevard
St. Germain, in Paris.

854
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,720
- What do you mean Paris?
- You know the one, Dad.

855
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,280
No! No!
No, no, no...

856
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:22,000
No, we don't have any French money.
And besides, it's...

857
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,400
Well, I don't think
he would agree with me.

858
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:25,080
Dad?

859
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:28,000
The French don't like us, Jenny.
You know that.

860
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,920
John Sutton from work,
he went there last year.

861
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,080
They were very rude to him.

862
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,200
I don't want to spoil
anyone's fun,

863
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:36,120
...but it's just not for me,
Europe.

864
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:39,520
- You'll have to go another time.
- You've just said you don't like Europe.

865
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,520
So what's going to change?
It'll have to be Europe, won't it?

866
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,320
Because it certainly won't be you.

867
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,080
- I'll take her.
- To the continent?

868
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,160
- Why not?
- And leave me here on my own?

869
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,160
Oh, for God's sake!

870
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:59,680
What do you think?

871
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,280
You know, what Jenny's
like about France, Jack?

872
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,960
French films and books
and music.

873
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,160
- Of course, I do.
- Sorry.

874
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,560
Yes, because without saying,
she's your daughter.

875
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:15,760
Jenny likes to joke about...

876
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,480
...how you're a stick in the mud
and all the rest of it.

877
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,480
But I know that's not
who you are.

878
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:24,040
Otherwise, she wouldn't be,
who she is.

879
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:25,600
No.

880
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:29,800
But I can also see that,
I've acted out of turn and...

881
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,840
...I'm sorry.

882
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:45,400
What about your aunt Helen?

883
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:57,160
<i>An hour late!
- We'll make it, I promise.</i>

884
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,800
Okay, there's a flight at eight
in the morning.

885
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,000
Good.

886
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:14,920
There's no bed!

887
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,640
I pushed the boat out
and got us a suite.

888
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,720
- A suite?
- Yeah.

889
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:22,960
Well, if work stops us from getting
to Paris until tomorrow, then...

890
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,440
...work can buy us
a nice hotel room.

891
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,640
Anyway, it's a special occasion,
isn't it?

892
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:32,360
I'd have thought that tonight
of all nights we only need a bed.

893
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:52,440
Hold on... one second.
I've got something.

894
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:05,800
I thought...

895
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:08,320
I thought we might
practice with this.

896
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:10,640
With a banana?

897
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,480
I thought we might get
the messy bit over with first.

898
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:15,640
What?

899
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:17,920
David!

900
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:21,600
I don't want to lose my virginity
to a piece of fruit.

901
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:24,840
I'm sorry.

902
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,800
Oh, I think the moment
might have gone.

903
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:37,800
- I think we should wait until Paris.
- I'm sorry, um...

904
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:39,600
Minnie.

905
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,360
I'm an idiot.
I'm sorry.

906
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:46,800
David...

907
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:51,200
...if tomorrow night does happen,
it's only ever going to happen once.

908
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:54,200
Why? Why it only ever happen once?

909
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:56,680
Because the first time can only
ever happen once.

910
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,240
So...

911
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,760
No, baby talk.

912
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,120
No Minnie.

913
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:13,480
Just... treat me like a grown-up.

914
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,600
Okay?

915
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:25,440
I know. Let's go and sit
in our sitting room.

916
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,320
Alright.

917
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:30,800
I'll order us some champagne.

918
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,160
Room service!

919
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:50,840
<b>Sur Les Quais Du Vieux Paris
performed by Juliette Greco</b>

920
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,800
Do you still feel like a schoolgirl?

921
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,880
And it wasn't too uncomfortable?

922
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,480
Not after the... first bit.

923
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:26,280
It's funny, though,
isn't it?

924
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:33,560
All that poetry,
and all those songs...

925
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:36,640
...about something
that lasts no time at all?

926
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,400
Yeah.

927
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:45,560
All your exercise books
on my desk in a pile, please.

928
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,840
I bought this for you.

929
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:56,280
That's very kind of you.

930
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:01,640
But I can't accept it.

931
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:03,960
Why not?

932
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:06,800
It's because of people like you...

933
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:11,440
...that I plough through illiterate essays
by Sandra Lovell about her pony.

934
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:14,720
But I know
where this came from, Jenny.

935
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,080
And if I took it...

936
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:20,280
...I'll feel I would be
betraying both of us.

937
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:35,600
Jenny.

938
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:42,400
You can do anything you want.
You know that.

939
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:45,040
You're clever
and you're pretty...

940
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:51,920
Is your boyfriend interested
in clever, Jenny?

941
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,040
I'm not quite sure
what you're trying to tell me.

942
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:57,960
I'm telling you to go to Oxford,
no matter what.

943
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:02,320
Because if you don't,
you'll break my heart.

944
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:12,320
- Where did you go?
- Cambridge.

945
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:14,880
Well, you're clever
and you're pretty.

946
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:16,760
So presumably,
Clever Miss Stubbs won.

947
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:19,120
And here you are
with your pony essays.

948
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:20,440
I don't know.
These last few months...

949
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:23,720
I've eaten in wonderful restaurants,
and went to jazz clubs,

950
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,960
...and watched wonderful films,

951
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,440
...heard beautiful music.

952
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:32,800
- Jenny, are you taking precautions?
- It's nothing to do with that.

953
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:34,080
Isn't it?

954
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,600
Maybe all our lives are going
to end up with pony essays.

955
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,440
Or housework.

956
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,360
And yes, maybe
we'll go up to Oxford.

957
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,920
But if we're all going to die
the moment we graduate,

958
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:44,280
...isn't it what we do
before that counts?

959
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,520
I'm sorry, you think I'm dead.

960
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:55,520
I don't think you're dead.
I just, uh...

961
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,520
I think, you'd better
get to your next class.

962
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:16,840
Well done, Jenny.

963
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,640
I've never won anything before.
Not even at the raffle.

964
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:21,840
...the sweetest looking
one of yours always comes last.

965
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:23,920
- Let's go.
- Can we do it again? I'm feeling lucky!

966
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,360
Come on, let's go.
I don't want to miss him.

967
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:28,240
- Pick up your 10 bob on your way out.
- I won 10 shillings!

968
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:30,680
Who is this man, anyway?

969
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:33,080
- Peter Rachman.
- A complete bastard.

970
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,560
Why do we've to see him here?

971
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:38,000
Because he's not a sort of chap
with an office.

972
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:42,920
Alright.

973
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:45,760
Ladies...

974
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:55,760
A bottle of your finest champagne, please.

975
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:57,360
There he is.

976
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:02,880
Come on, Jenny.

977
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:04,400
Tell them your good news.
Don't be bashful.

978
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,240
No. Be sneezy.

979
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:09,320
Jenny got two A's
and a B in her mock-A levels.

980
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:11,400
Like everyone else in this
sophisticated establishment.

981
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:14,200
- The B was in Latin.
- Well, seriously, congratulations.

982
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:15,400
Excuse us.

983
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:22,560
Don't worry too much.

984
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,160
About what?

985
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:29,040
Someone told me that in about 50 yrs
no one will speak Latin, probably.

986
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,560
Not even Latin people.

987
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,640
So don't worry about your B.

988
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,000
He's even more of a bastard,
than I thought.

989
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:42,000
You don't want him
to marry your sister.

990
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:44,440
Or want to talk to him in a club,
come to that.

991
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,760
You do know
what you're doing, old chap?

992
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,520
With Jenny?

993
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,120
- This is the one, Danny.
- Right.

994
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,960
You can see, she's different.

995
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:59,640
I just don't want to see her hurt.

996
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,640
Have you bought any more
paintings recently?

997
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:27,640
Have I?

998
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:30,640
Yes. Picked up a little Piper.

999
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:32,160
A good one, I think.

1000
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:34,520
I'm still trying to work out
what makes good things good.

1001
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:37,080
- It's hard, isn't it?
- Well, the thing is, Jenny...

1002
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:38,840
...you know,

1003
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:41,440
...without necessarily being
able to explain why.

1004
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,320
See, you've taste.

1005
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:46,120
That's not half the battle.

1006
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:48,680
That's the whole war.

1007
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,400
Jenny, we should go.
It's late.

1008
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:12,800
- Really?
- Yeah.

1009
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:15,400
Alas. One day, school will be
over forever,

1010
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:17,480
...and we can talk about
art all night.

1011
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:19,280
You're alright in a taxi,
aren't you?

1012
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:21,600
- Yeah. I'm fine.
- Yeah?

1013
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:23,520
Let's go.
Come on.

1014
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,240
Good night.

1015
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,080
Wait here.

1016
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:41,640
David, what are you looking for?

1017
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,000
It's just...

1018
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:47,400
What are you doing?

1019
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:51,000
Will you marry me?

1020
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,360
What were you looking for?

1021
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,680
I... I thought I had a ring.

1022
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:59,480
It wouldn't have been the right one.
But it would have done for tonight.

1023
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:02,400
Oh, David.

1024
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:05,120
I'm serious.

1025
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,520
You're very sweet.

1026
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,360
What do you think?

1027
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:25,440
- Take me home.
- Alright.

1028
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,040
<i>They do need some looking after,</i>

1029
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:56,160
<i>...but nothing that will require
too much work.</i>

1030
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:58,760
<i>Just leave them in your potting shed
for a couple of weeks,</i>

1031
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:00,200
<i>...and they'll look after themselves.</i>

1032
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:01,640
Fine, the potting shed.

1033
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:04,560
Who does he think I am?
Prince Rainier of Monaco?

1034
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,680
What if I got married
instead of going to college?

1035
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,560
- Married?
- Married.

1036
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:17,160
Well, it would depend who it was,
of course.

1037
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:18,560
Would it?

1038
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:20,760
- That's interesting.
- Of course it would.

1039
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:23,160
I wouldn't want you married off
just for the sake of it.

1040
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:23,960
Thanks.

1041
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,440
- Has somebody asked you?
- Yes.

1042
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:28,040
Who?

1043
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:30,200
David?

1044
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:32,840
No. A man I just met
walking his dog.

1045
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:36,120
- What did you tell him?
- Nothing yet.

1046
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:39,560
Do you have a choice?
Or is it too late?

1047
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:42,280
Of course, she's got a choice.

1048
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:44,400
An interesting choice too, eh?

1049
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:46,080
This is where
you're supposed to say,

1050
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:47,640
"But what about Oxford?"

1051
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,720
Well, looked at it another way,

1052
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:52,160
...you wouldn't really need to go now,
would you?

1053
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,920
I wouldn't need to go.

1054
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:58,720
- Would you like to expand on that?
- You'd be looked after.

1055
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,400
All that Latin!
All those essays!

1056
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:04,120
What was the point?

1057
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,640
Why didn't you just send me
prowling round nightclubs?

1058
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:08,760
It would have been less trouble.
And I might have had more fun.

1059
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:11,920
I don't know about nightclubs,
I know about education.

1060
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:14,760
Anyway, looks like it might have
turned out for the best.

1061
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:16,080
How?

1062
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:20,080
He wouldn't want you
if you were thick, now, would he?

1063
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:23,520
<i>May not an ass know
when the cart draws the horse?</i>

1064
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,800
Sings whoop jug,
I love thee.

1065
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:28,080
And when it says "Sings",

1066
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,960
...it means, you sing the line.

1067
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:34,880
Never mind. Right.
Leer?

1068
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:36,480
Does any here know me?

1069
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:39,160
This is not Lear.
Does Lear walk thus?

1070
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:40,880
Speak thus?

1071
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:42,960
Where are his eyes?

1072
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,400
Waking? Who is it that can
tell me who I am?

1073
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:50,760
Oh, Miss, me.
I can.

1074
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:53,840
Oh, Jenny.

1075
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:56,040
What?

1076
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:00,080
Take it off.

1077
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,240
Oh, my God!

1078
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,080
Is that what I think it is?

1079
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:07,160
I'm going to be a bridemaid!

1080
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:11,280
You know the school rule on jewelry.

1081
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:12,960
Half the girls in this room
are wearing jewelry.

1082
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:15,560
Yes. But none of it is
going to ruin their lives.

1083
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:20,040
We have a difference of opinion
about that.

1084
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:25,800
How far advanced are these
ridiculous plans?

1085
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:28,600
Have you set a date?
Have you decided on a church?

1086
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:30,880
We won't be getting married
in a church.

1087
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:32,600
David's Jewish.

1088
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:35,400
Jewish?

1089
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,360
He's a Jew?

1090
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:42,880
You're aware, I take it,
that the Jews killed our Lord?

1091
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:46,280
And you're aware, I suppose,
that our Lord was Jewish?

1092
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:49,360
I suppose he told you that.

1093
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:53,800
We're all very sorry about
what happened at during the War.

1094
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:56,400
But that's absolutely no excuse
for that sort of...

1095
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:59,200
...malicious and untruthful
propaganda.

1096
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:02,440
Anyway, I can see, you're far more
in need of responsible advice...

1097
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:04,000
...than I realised.

1098
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:08,600
Nobody does anything
worth doing without a degree.

1099
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:11,480
Nobody does anything
worth doing with a degree.

1100
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:12,920
No woman, anyway.

1101
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:15,160
So what I do isn't worth doing?

1102
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:17,920
Or what Ms. Stubbs does,
or Mrs. Wilson, or any of us here?

1103
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:19,720
Because none of us would be here
without our degree,

1104
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:20,760
...you do realise that,
don't you?

1105
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,840
And yes, of course studying is hard,
and boring...

1106
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,920
- Boring!
- I'm sorry?

1107
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,920
Studying is hard and boring.

1108
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,520
Teaching is hard and boring.

1109
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:31,040
So you're telling me to be bored,
and then bored,

1110
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:34,000
...and finally bored again,
but this time for the rest of my life.

1111
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:36,800
This whole stupid country is bored.

1112
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,720
There's no life in it,
or colour, or fun.

1113
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:41,640
It's probably just as well,
the Russians are gonna drop...

1114
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:43,720
...a nuclear bomb on
us any day now. So...

1115
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:47,080
...my choice is to do
something hard and boring,

1116
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:50,120
...or to marry my Jew.

1117
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:53,440
And go to Paris and Rome
and listen to jazz...

1118
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:55,920
...and read and eat good food
in nice restaurants...

1119
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:57,480
...and have fun.

1120
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:00,160
It's not enough to educate us
any more, Ms. Walters.

1121
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:02,760
You've got to tell us,
why you're doing it.

1122
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:07,520
It doesn't have to be teaching,
you know?

1123
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:09,600
There's the Civil Service.

1124
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:16,000
I don't wish to be impertinent,
Ms. Walters.

1125
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:18,880
But it is an argument
worth rehearsing.

1126
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:20,280
You never know.

1127
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:23,160
Someone else might want to know
the point of it all, one day.

1128
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:12,440
Where did you find him?

1129
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:13,640
I can't tell you that.

1130
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:14,920
- Why?
- I think he likes you.

1131
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:16,720
Do you like her?
"I thought you would like her. "

1132
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,480
You... you don't?
What?

1133
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:19,960
You don't remember?
It's Jenny!

1134
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:22,080
You remember her from last time.
"No, I don't. "

1135
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:23,400
Yes, you do!

1136
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:25,160
You naughty!
You're pardoned?

1137
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:28,160
Stick to your own species.

1138
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:30,960
He wants to kiss you,
I think.

1139
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:32,800
Isn't that naughty?

1140
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:35,160
We are engaged.

1141
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:37,080
No!

1142
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:38,440
- Really?
- Yeah.

1143
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:39,800
- Engaged?
- Show her.

1144
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:41,000
Yes, look!

1145
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:44,600
Gosh! That's fantastic news.

1146
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:45,920
Thank you.

1147
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:47,160
Congratulations.

1148
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:48,840
I knew you'd see sense
about university.

1149
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,240
You'll stay pretty now.

1150
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:51,840
Can I still read?

1151
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:54,200
Of course, but it doesn't
have to be books, does it?

1152
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:55,840
And magazines will do just as well.

1153
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:57,440
And you learn
more from them anyway.

1154
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:58,760
Oh, Helen.

1155
01:13:58,960 --> 01:13:59,800
Oh, you won't be laughing, David,

1156
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:02,400
...when she gets all speccy
and spotty.

1157
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:12,320
Danny didn't seem very pleased
about our engagement.

1158
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:15,320
I noticed that, too!
Thought he might be a bit jealous.

1159
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:17,320
Jealous?

1160
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:19,760
We're going to keep him
away from you.

1161
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:29,360
I mean, what I'm supposed to order
for starter, anyway?

1162
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:31,720
And how will I know what is a starter
and what isn't?

1163
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:33,120
We've been through this, Dad.

1164
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:35,680
It'll be quite clearly marked
on the menu.

1165
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,080
Oh, can't the three of you
just go on your own?

1166
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:40,680
Leave me here. I'll be perfectly
happy with a tin of salmon.

1167
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,640
Hello.
- Hello.

1168
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:52,480
Ready?

1169
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:53,680
I think you'll like this place, Jack.

1170
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:55,680
Their wine list is as good as
anything I've seen in London.

1171
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:57,520
Yes, someone told me that.

1172
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:59,960
David, probably.
Who else would it have been?

1173
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:03,720
Madam.

1174
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:05,680
I was hoping
you'd take us in this.

1175
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:07,960
Hey, you won't want to drive in
anything else after tonight.

1176
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:10,320
- Mind you, it drinks petrol.
- Yes.

1177
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:12,680
I'm afraid we'll have to stop
on the way into town.

1178
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:16,360
<i>- I feel like Eamonn Andrews.
- Is that a good thing?</i>

1179
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:19,920
<i>Eamonn Andrews is the poshest person
that Jack can imagine being.</i>

1180
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:36,720
How are you tonight, sir?
- Very well.

1181
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,240
You might as well fill her up.

1182
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:42,320
I'm gonna make a quick call.
I'll be two ticks.

1183
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,440
Do you think I should offer to help,
pay for the petrol?

1184
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:55,680
Would he feel insulted,
what do you think?

1185
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:58,160
I know, he said tonight was his treat.

1186
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,520
But, does that apply to the petrol,
what do you think?

1187
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,520
I'm quite sure it does, Jack.

1188
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:13,040
- Jack!
- Come on, it just came off.

1189
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:24,360
- Filled my bill? Huh?
- Thank you, sir.

1190
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:25,640
Take this.

1191
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:31,000
Jenny! Jenny...

1192
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,200
- Take us home.
- What's wrong?

1193
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:35,880
I'm afraid there's been...

1194
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:37,720
- Jenny's in bit of a shock.
- What's happened?

1195
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:42,160
It's just another one of David's
little muddles and misunderstandings.

1196
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:44,600
I don't want to hear another word
from anybody.

1197
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:46,579
- Take us home. Now!
- Fine.

1198
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:59,360
You can take care of this,
can't you, David?

1199
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:01,120
Go inside, Dad.

1200
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:07,600
Mr. and Mrs. David Goldman,

1201
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:10,560
Mr. and Mrs. David Goldman,
Mr. and Mrs. David...

1202
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:11,960
You're married!

1203
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:15,160
Legally, yes, but I...

1204
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:16,760
When were you going to tell me?

1205
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,000
Soon.

1206
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:20,760
It just never seemed
like the right time.

1207
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:26,400
You seemed so happy,
and I was happy...

1208
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:29,600
You were living with your wife!
All this time!

1209
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,200
Around the corner!
Byron Avenue!

1210
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:34,320
It's no wonder we kept bumping
into each other, is it?

1211
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:37,440
- What number?
- Thrity four.

1212
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:44,960
Don't be like this.
Come on.

1213
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:50,160
I have nothing.

1214
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:52,840
I didn't take my exams.

1215
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:56,080
I do...
I left school.

1216
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:59,480
Where's it all gone, now?

1217
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:02,680
I can get a divorce.

1218
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:08,160
Everything will turn out for the best.

1219
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,360
Go and tell them.

1220
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:23,920
Go and tell them,
then go and tell your wife.

1221
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:28,320
They won't listen now.
Alright?

1222
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:30,640
I'll come round tomorrow.
When...

1223
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:33,120
...everyone's a bit calmer.

1224
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:34,920
Please don't leave me...

1225
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:37,520
Please don't leave me
to tell them on my own.

1226
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:40,360
You owe me that much.
You owe them that much.

1227
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:42,640
I owe them much more than that.

1228
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:07,800
Two minutes. And then
I'll come out and drag you in.

1229
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:04,920
What's going on?

1230
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:11,600
He's helping himself to some
Dutch courage before facing you.

1231
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:15,440
Stolen Dutch courage,
from the look of it.

1232
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:19,120
He has something
he has to tell you.

1233
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:32,720
He just drove off.

1234
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:40,000
Can you tell us?

1235
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:44,080
Jenny, please?

1236
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:52,000
I wouldn't worry about it too much.

1237
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,600
- When I found out...
- Not now, Helen.

1238
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:07,200
I tried to tell him.

1239
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:10,760
I'm not speaking to him now,

1240
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:12,760
...if that's any consolation.

1241
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:17,520
It's a funny world
you people live in.

1242
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:21,280
You both watched me
carrying on with a married man,

1243
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:22,840
...and you did't think
it's worth saying anything about.

1244
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,840
If you want that conversation...

1245
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,320
You watched David and I
help ourselves to a map,

1246
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:30,760
...and you didn't say much either.

1247
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:58,760
Come on, you.
Let's go.

1248
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:00,360
Good boy.

1249
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,120
Hello.

1250
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:11,360
Hello.

1251
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:13,040
Sorry, I think
I have the wrong number.

1252
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:16,480
I was looking for my...
I wanted number for my cello lesson.

1253
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:22,200
Oh, no.
Don't tell me.

1254
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,240
Good God!

1255
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:27,680
You're a child.

1256
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:33,440
You didn't know about
any of this.

1257
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:35,240
Presumably.

1258
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:40,840
No. They never do.

1259
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:46,880
You're not in the family way,
are you?

1260
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:48,800
Because that's happened before.

1261
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:55,120
Thank God for that.

1262
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,920
No. No.
You stay here.

1263
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:15,200
Did you see her?
- Yes, I saw her.

1264
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:18,120
I didn't talk to her.
There wasn't any need.

1265
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:19,920
We've to have this out.

1266
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:23,040
Well, if you won't do it,
I will.

1267
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:25,920
- I'm still your father.
- You're my father again, are you?

1268
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:28,960
What were you when you encouraged
me to throw my life away?

1269
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,600
Silly schoolgirls are always getting
seduced by glamorous older men.

1270
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:34,320
What about you two?

1271
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,240
Jenny?

1272
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:12,080
Jenny?

1273
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:18,280
<i>Jenny, I'm sorry.</i>

1274
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,920
I know... I know I've made
a mess of everything.

1275
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:38,800
All my life I've been scared,

1276
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:42,320
I didn't want you to be scared.

1277
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:47,200
That's why I wanted you
to go to Oxford.

1278
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:51,200
<i>And then along came David, and...</i>

1279
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:53,000
<i>...he knew famous writers,</i>

1280
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:55,880
<i>...he knew how to get to
classical music concerts.</i>

1281
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:02,840
<i>But he wasn't
who he said he was.</i>

1282
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:08,120
<i>He wasn't who you said
he was, either.</i>

1283
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:19,240
The other day, your mother
and I were listening to a...

1284
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:22,800
...a program on the radio about
C.S. Lewis and they said...

1285
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:26,440
...that he moved to Cambridge
in 1954.

1286
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:32,200
<i>I... I said...
well, they've got that wrong.</i>

1287
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:37,960
<i>Our Jenny wouldn't have
his name in her book...</i>

1288
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:41,520
<i>...if he'd moved to Cambridge.</i>

1289
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:53,760
There's a cup of tea
and some biscuits out here.

1290
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:27,480
How do you think we can help?

1291
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:32,160
I want to repeat my last year
at school.

1292
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:34,080
And take my exams.

1293
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:37,320
I got the impression
the last time we spoke...

1294
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:39,320
...that you didn't see
the point of school.

1295
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:41,640
Or of me,
or of any of us here.

1296
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:43,840
I know. I was stupid.

1297
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:47,880
The life I want...
there's no shortcut.

1298
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:52,080
I know now that
I need to go to university.

1299
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:56,360
It gives me absolutely
no pleasure whatsoever to see...

1300
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:59,440
...our young schoolgirls
throwing their lives away.

1301
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:02,640
Although, of course, you're not
one of our schoolgirls any more.

1302
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:04,440
Through your own volition.

1303
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:07,880
I suppose you think
I'm a ruined woman.

1304
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:11,440
You're not a woman.

1305
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:15,760
No, I'm afraid, I think that
the offer of a place at this school...

1306
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:17,480
...would be wasted on you.

1307
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:43,320
Come in.

1308
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:47,840
I didn't expect to see you again.

1309
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:57,200
This is lovely.

1310
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:00,560
All your books and
pictures and...

1311
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:04,600
Paperbacks and postcards, Jenny.

1312
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:07,520
That's all you need, isn't it?

1313
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:12,200
Just somewhere to...

1314
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:23,456
I'm sorry
I said those silly things.

1315
01:28:23,656 --> 01:28:25,591
I didn't understand them.

1316
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:30,680
Let's forget about it.

1317
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:41,200
A Burne-Jones.

1318
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:44,520
- Do you like him?
- I do.

1319
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:46,120
Still.

1320
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:48,720
Still?

1321
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:51,520
You sound very old and wise.

1322
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:55,640
I feel old.

1323
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,920
But not very wise.

1324
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:05,080
Ms. Stubbs, I need your help.

1325
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:12,960
I was so hoping
that's what you were gonna say.

1326
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:03,120
Thank you, Marjorie.

1327
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:19,680
It's from Oxford.

1328
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:56,040
<i>It is my pleasure,
to inform you that...</i>

1329
01:30:56,080 --> 01:31:01,200
<i>...your application to read English
at Oxford has been accepted.</i>

1330
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:05,673
<i>On behalf of the Faculty of Arts,
staff of the University...</i>

1331
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:28,320
<i>So I went to read English books.</i>

1332
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:32,840
<i>And did my best to avoid the speccy-spotty
fate that Helen had predicted for me.</i>

1333
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:36,440
<i>I probably look as wide-eyed,
fresh and artless...</i>

1334
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:38,440
<i>...as any other student.</i>

1335
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:40,320
<i>But I wasn't.</i>

1336
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,240
<i>One of the boys I went out with,
and they really were boys,</i>

1337
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:48,000
<i>...once asked me to
go to Paris with him.</i>

1338
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:50,320
<i>And I told him,
I'd love to.</i>

1339
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,920
<i>I was dying to see Paris.</i>

1340
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:56,040
<i>As if I'd never been!</i>
