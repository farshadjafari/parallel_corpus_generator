1
00:00:42,657 --> 00:00:45,300
My name is Andre. Andre Moussa.

2
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,800
28 years old. Single. U.S. citizen.

3
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,102
Paris is a wonderful city, although I don't really have the time to enjoy it.
Too much work...

4
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,800
I also do business in Argentina, Chile... a bit in China.

5
00:00:56,801 --> 00:01:01,801
Almost nothing in the U.S., actually.
Just my penthouse in N.Y.C., right above Central Park.

6
00:01:01,802 --> 00:01:04,802
Let's focus on Paris...
I've made many friends here.

7
00:01:04,803 --> 00:01:09,400
I used to think the French would be angry about the Iraq war,
and this silly disagreement between our countries.

8
00:01:09,401 --> 00:01:11,500
But it's not the case.

9
00:01:11,501 --> 00:01:14,805
Maybe it's thanks to my behaviour.
I'm nice, generous...

10
00:01:15,806 --> 00:01:19,100
I'm not too bad in bed.
Things are going well for me.

11
00:01:19,101 --> 00:01:23,101
I think I can tell sincerely that I am a nice guy.

12
00:01:23,102 --> 00:01:29,102
Here you go. That's all I can tell you about me.
Who I would like to be. ... would dream to be.

13
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,500
Because I'm lying.

14
00:01:31,504 --> 00:01:32,104
To myself.

15
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,000
To everyone.

16
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,500
All day.

17
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:42,801
You really are an American piece of crap.
Do you believe we're going to believe that story?

18
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:45,802
I'm not American. I told you...
I won my green card at the lottery.

19
00:01:45,803 --> 00:01:48,000
They do that every year.
I'm from Morocco.

20
00:01:48,001 --> 00:01:50,001
I don't like Arabs either!

21
00:01:52,002 --> 00:01:54,002
Stop punching, damnit!

22
00:01:54,003 --> 00:01:57,003
It's a misunderstanding.
I didn't have the time to explain.

23
00:01:57,004 --> 00:01:58,254
Okay. You have 10 seconds.

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,702
Here you go.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,703
If it wasn't for that, I would have repaid you a long time ago.

26
00:02:11,704 --> 00:02:14,000
And you don't have a credit card?

27
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:16,700
If I had a card, I would have gotten cash anywhere.
There's one of those banks with the squirrel, right here.

28
00:02:16,701 --> 00:02:17,400
Shut up!

29
00:02:17,401 --> 00:02:20,401
Shut your mouth! When you open it, it pisses me off even more.

30
00:02:20,402 --> 00:02:22,000
No, you haven't understood.

31
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:25,300
Don't even say 'okay'.
Shut your mouth 100%.

32
00:02:25,301 --> 00:02:26,601
You understand '100%' ?

33
00:02:26,602 --> 00:02:30,150
Don't say a single word.
Breathe. That's all.

34
00:02:35,151 --> 00:02:37,000
Here you go. Good.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,500
That must be tough.

36
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:42,501
For a fucking American like you...
Shutting up.

37
00:02:44,502 --> 00:02:46,502
You who always want to teach lessons to the world.

38
00:02:47,503 --> 00:02:52,000
No comment. Just shut up.
And quietly listen to what I have to say.

39
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:55,001
Mamou... Do you remember Monsieur Mamou?

40
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,500
You owe money to Monsieur Mamou.

41
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:06,450
40,000 Euros !
Not shitty Dollars... Euros!

42
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:12,000
And if you haven't returned them by tonight.
I will find you, and break your fingers.

43
00:03:12,001 --> 00:03:14,151
And if it's not enough, I'll break your arms.

44
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,152
And your legs.

45
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,153
And your head.

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I know that song... I like it.

47
00:03:20,001 --> 00:03:23,980
You have until tonight.
And tonight ends at midnight.

48
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:27,500
After that, it's tomorrow.
And tomorrow, you'll be dead!

49
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,000
See you later.

50
00:03:38,001 --> 00:03:40,500
Suddenly, two things had become very clear to me.

51
00:03:40,501 --> 00:03:45,150
I really had to do something.
And I definitely hated Paris.

52
00:03:45,151 --> 00:03:46,151
Monsieur Frank!

53
00:03:49,201 --> 00:03:51,900
Please... Monsieur Frank.

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,860
I don't really understand, Andre.

55
00:04:04,861 --> 00:04:09,900
I welcome you in my home, as a friend. Introduce you to people.
Lend you money when you're in need.

56
00:04:09,901 --> 00:04:10,901
And what do I get in return?

57
00:04:10,902 --> 00:04:11,902
I can explain!

58
00:04:11,903 --> 00:04:16,000
Not a word. Not a phonecall.
And now you make me climb the fucking Eiffel tower to find you...

59
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:17,500
Do you really think I have the time to be a tourist?

60
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:21,500
No, of course you're not a tourist, Monsieur Frank.
I can explain... please!

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,100
Go ahead, I'm listening.

62
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:27,224
Can you ask this gentleman to bring me back on the ground?
It would me more convenient...

63
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,100
I hear you just fine from here.
Hurry up, I'm running late.

64
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:33,000
I've lost my identification, my passport and all my credit cards.
I went to the American Express offices.

65
00:04:33,001 --> 00:04:34,001
Let go of him.

66
00:04:34,002 --> 00:04:36,002
No, Frank! Please!
Don't let go!

67
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,003
Monsieur Frank!
Please!

68
00:04:43,004 --> 00:04:44,004
Something to add?

69
00:04:44,005 --> 00:04:46,005
Tonight.
I'm paying tonight.

70
00:04:46,006 --> 00:04:47,600
On my mother's head! I'm paying tonight.

71
00:04:47,601 --> 00:04:48,900
Why should I care?
I don't know your mother.

72
00:04:48,901 --> 00:04:50,450
I'm paying everything tonight.
On the whoever's head you want.

73
00:04:50,451 --> 00:04:53,000
And how do you intend to do that?
You're broke, and indebted to everybody in Paris.

74
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,100
I don't know. I don't know.

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,200
But I'm having a hard time thinking
I'm my current position.

76
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,200
You're aware that I have men in every train station?

77
00:05:00,201 --> 00:05:01,201
I know, Monsieur Frank.

78
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,000
So, don't try to run.

79
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:06,700
No.
That would be a very bad idea.

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,200
I give you until midnight.

81
00:05:09,901 --> 00:05:11,100
Thank you, Monsieur Frank.

82
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,001
You have no idea how glad I am to see you, Monsieur.

83
00:05:49,002 --> 00:05:51,400
Good morning, sir.
Can I see your papers, please?

84
00:05:51,405 --> 00:05:53,600
No, but don't worry, I'm American.

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,650
Did you block your credit cards?

86
00:05:56,651 --> 00:05:59,000
Yes. All of them.
And now I can't get cash anymore.

87
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:01,450
It makes things rather difficult.
Life is so expensive in Paris...

88
00:06:01,451 --> 00:06:02,451
I know...

89
00:06:02,452 --> 00:06:05,000
But American Express can make you a new card in 24 hours,
can't they?

90
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:07,690
Yes, but for that I need to prove my identity.

91
00:06:07,691 --> 00:06:10,000
And since I don't have my papers anymore,
I can't prove my identity.

92
00:06:10,001 --> 00:06:11,500
Ah, yes...
It's a vicious circle.

93
00:06:11,501 --> 00:06:15,200
On top of that, it's Saturday.
All my friends have either gone to the country or on holidays.

94
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:17,100
Baldwin alley, it's in Manhattan?

95
00:06:17,101 --> 00:06:19,750
No. Brooklyn.
Number 720. 5th floor.

96
00:06:19,751 --> 00:06:20,751
You want the phone number?

97
00:06:20,752 --> 00:06:22,500
No, it's okay.
I have it already.

98
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,400
Really?
You have this kind of data in the computer?

99
00:06:26,401 --> 00:06:29,000
Yes. I also have your three condemnations.

100
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,501
Really?

101
00:06:31,502 --> 00:06:34,800
Then it must have told you that it's ancient history.
I was young...

102
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,500
The last one was three months ago.

103
00:06:36,501 --> 00:06:39,300
Ah...
You have this one too?

104
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,800
That computer is powerful.

105
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,300
Did it tell you it was a misunderstanding?

106
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,700
In the report, they call it a con job.

107
00:06:48,701 --> 00:06:50,300
And you almost got three months for it.

108
00:06:50,301 --> 00:06:51,900
Yes. It's true.

109
00:06:51,901 --> 00:06:53,901
And I intend to appeal when I return.

110
00:06:53,902 --> 00:06:56,450
Monsieur Moussa, there is not much we can do for you.

111
00:06:56,451 --> 00:07:02,000
I suggest you go to the nearest police station. And declare the theft.
They will give you temporary papers.

112
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,220
Listen, sir...

113
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,200
I am an American citizen.

114
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:13,700
I have rights. Written in a constitution.
For which my great-grandparents have fought their entire lives.

115
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,600
I think I deserve my country's support.
Especially in such a desperate situation.

116
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:19,200
Monsieur Moussa, your grandparents lived in Algery.

117
00:07:19,201 --> 00:07:21,000
So, maybe they fought for independance...

118
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,400
But certainly not the U.S. independance.

119
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:26,400
Keep in mind that the green card you won at the lottery
requires that you obey some rules.

120
00:07:26,401 --> 00:07:29,800
Rules written at the back of the document
that you obviously did not bother reading.

121
00:07:29,801 --> 00:07:35,740
It is clearly written that the American administration
can cancel your visa in case of severe or repeated offense.

122
00:07:35,741 --> 00:07:38,800
And in your case, you ostensibly combine both criteria.

123
00:07:38,801 --> 00:07:41,600
Now, let me give you a more personal piece of advice.

124
00:07:41,601 --> 00:07:45,051
I think that the only person that can do anything for you is... yourself.

125
00:07:45,052 --> 00:07:49,750
Please exit the building quietly.
Or I am going to call the marines in charge of security.

126
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,500
Hey, Andre!
Andre!

127
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,501
You've got my money, Andre?

128
00:08:44,502 --> 00:08:47,000
Hey, Andre, come here!
You fucker!

129
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,300
Hi!

130
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,100
What are you here for?

131
00:09:20,501 --> 00:09:24,000
Well, err...
I was thinking that... err...

132
00:09:24,001 --> 00:09:26,901
I was intending to...

133
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,500
I can't take it anymore.

134
00:09:36,501 --> 00:09:38,500
I'm at the end of the rope.

135
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,850
What's wrong, little fellow?

136
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,000
I fucked up.
I have borrowed lots of money.

137
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:48,500
And my calculations were slightly wrong.

138
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,000
Now I can't return anything to these guys.

139
00:09:51,001 --> 00:09:52,800
And if I don't do it
they're going to shoot me.

140
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:57,250
And you want to report them?

141
00:09:57,251 --> 00:10:02,000
Nah... reporting them...
If I do that they're going to shoot me even more.

142
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,550
What can I do for you, then?

143
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,150
I was thinking that... you...

144
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:18,380
Maybe you could put me in jail for a few days...
Until I figure things out.

145
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:22,235
That's a joke for TV? Is that it?

146
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,500
No, it's not for TV.

147
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,500
Can't you see I'm about to crack?
And you tell me about TV jokes!

148
00:10:30,801 --> 00:10:31,501
I'm asking you to throw me in jail!

149
00:10:31,502 --> 00:10:33,850
An Arab without any ID papers.
That shouldn't be a problem!

150
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,200
What 'uh...' ?

151
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,300
You bastards!

152
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,400
Cowards!

153
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,250
What kind of police is that?

154
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,600
You only start reacting now, uh?

155
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,200
Well... it's too late!

156
00:11:23,201 --> 00:11:24,250
I'm going to kill myself!

157
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,400
And it's your fault.

158
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,150
Nobody cares about me, is that it?

159
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,999
I'm going to do it.

160
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,500
Is that what you want?

161
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,800
Why are you giving up on me?

162
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,800
Why don't you ever answer my questions?

163
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,000
What are you doing here?

164
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,250
Well... the same as you.

165
00:12:21,251 --> 00:12:23,150
Meaning?

166
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,800
Don't worry!

167
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,500
I'm coming.
I'm here.

168
00:12:40,501 --> 00:12:42,150
Don't worry.
I'm here.

169
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:00,600
What the hell was that all about?

170
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,400
I can't even kill myself in peace.
Even there, someone has to annoy me.

171
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:08,750
Don't I deserve a minute alone?
So that I can leave with dignity?

172
00:13:08,751 --> 00:13:10,800
You... what did you come here for?
It's Sunday morning!

173
00:13:10,801 --> 00:13:12,400
Couldn't you stay in bed, like everybody?

174
00:13:12,401 --> 00:13:13,431
I couldn't sleep.

175
00:13:13,432 --> 00:13:16,765
Then you should have chosen another bridge.
We have plenty of them in this fucking city!

176
00:13:16,766 --> 00:13:18,700
Didn't you see that one was occupied?

177
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,200
We had the same idea.
Isn't that funny?

178
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:23,700
Funny, yeah...
Hysterical.

179
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,450
Can you tell me why
you want to jump off that bridge so badly?

180
00:13:26,451 --> 00:13:28,400
Probably because I have the same problems as you.

181
00:13:28,401 --> 00:13:29,401
I don't think so...

182
00:13:29,402 --> 00:13:30,700
Why?

183
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,600
Because my problem is that I feel stupid,
ugly, and totally useless.

184
00:13:34,601 --> 00:13:36,750
And I don't think you have this kind of problem.

185
00:13:36,751 --> 00:13:40,150
It's exactly the same :
I'm stupid and ugly

186
00:13:40,151 --> 00:13:41,350
...on the inside.

187
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,150
At least you can hide it, with your looks.

188
00:13:45,151 --> 00:13:47,000
I have nothing to hide.

189
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,250
I can see that, yeah...

190
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,350
Can you tell me, why a girl like you can feel so bad?

191
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,000
You're young.
You're beautiful.

192
00:13:55,352 --> 00:13:59,450
The world could be at your feet.
You could ask for anything.

193
00:13:59,451 --> 00:14:01,000
So? What do I want?

194
00:14:01,001 --> 00:14:02,800
I don't know.
I'm not a psychic.

195
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,450
To be rich, I guess.
Like everybody.

196
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,700
To spend your money around the world.
To be attractive...

197
00:14:09,701 --> 00:14:12,000
To buy dresses, furs...

198
00:14:12,001 --> 00:14:13,750
That's what makes women happy,
if I understand correctly.

199
00:14:13,751 --> 00:14:15,800
And you?
What would make you happy?

200
00:14:15,801 --> 00:14:18,650
To be left alone, at peace...
To breathe. Here's what I need.

201
00:14:18,651 --> 00:14:21,449
I need time to figure things out.
Can't you see what I look like?

202
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:24,350
What matters is on the inside,
no on the outside.

203
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:27,250
Easy for you...
Don't you see how good you look?

204
00:14:27,251 --> 00:14:30,150
Women think they're the ones to talk...
Who would be dead if it wasn't for me?

205
00:14:30,151 --> 00:14:32,950
And who would be dead if he didn't
have someone to save?

206
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,950
Don't you have a smoke?

207
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,000
Listen... I'm not in the mood for psychological games.
Especially on a Sunday morning.

208
00:14:40,002 --> 00:14:43,500
Yeah, you're right.
What are we doing now?

209
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:50,900
Why 'what are we doing' ?

210
00:14:50,901 --> 00:14:54,150
You saved my life.
I suppose you intend to do something with it.

211
00:14:54,151 --> 00:14:58,000
No. I didn't think.
I jumped by chance.

212
00:14:58,001 --> 00:15:00,130
People should not be left to die.
It's not good.

213
00:15:00,131 --> 00:15:02,700
I agree.
So... what do we do now?

214
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:05,000
Nothing! Just leave me alone.

215
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:07,500
Damn, men...
You really are all the same.

216
00:15:07,501 --> 00:15:10,400
You act without thinking,
and then you throw us away.

217
00:15:10,401 --> 00:15:13,700
That's enough.
I'm not in the mood for an argument either.

218
00:15:13,701 --> 00:15:15,400
Bye.

219
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,500
What's your first name?

220
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,900
Angela.

221
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,750
Listen, Angela.
If I leave you like that, will you try it again?

222
00:15:35,751 --> 00:15:36,450
Try what?

223
00:15:36,451 --> 00:15:37,900
Jumping off bridges, obviously!

224
00:15:37,901 --> 00:15:39,001
It's likely...

225
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,650
Can't you try changing your mind?

226
00:15:40,651 --> 00:15:42,000
Why?

227
00:15:42,001 --> 00:15:44,750
What kind if question is that?

228
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,100
Because you...

229
00:15:48,101 --> 00:15:49,550
Because you're beautiful.

230
00:15:49,551 --> 00:15:51,800
And losing a pretty girl like you
would be a waste.

231
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,150
And also because I never did
anything good in my life.

232
00:15:55,151 --> 00:15:57,100
So, knowing that I saved someone,
at least once...

233
00:15:57,101 --> 00:15:58,600
That could help me.

234
00:15:58,601 --> 00:16:00,550
If you could do that for me,
I would appreciate it.

235
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,750
I'll see what I can do.

236
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,350
Thank you.

237
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,351
Don't mention it...

238
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,200
Bye.

239
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,650
Good bye...

240
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,250
Why don't you dedicate your life to a cause?

241
00:16:20,251 --> 00:16:21,251
What cause?

242
00:16:21,252 --> 00:16:24,650
I don't know... Orphans in India?
Kids with aids in Africa?

243
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,200
Why go so far?

244
00:16:26,201 --> 00:16:28,380
You're right.

245
00:16:28,381 --> 00:16:30,250
Poverty is everywhere.

246
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,000
Why not help people in need,
here in Paris?

247
00:16:34,001 --> 00:16:35,450
People you could be a relief to.

248
00:16:35,451 --> 00:16:36,551
People like you?

249
00:16:36,552 --> 00:16:39,000
Yes.
Uh... no!

250
00:16:39,001 --> 00:16:40,001
I'm fine.

251
00:16:40,002 --> 00:16:41,302
Yeah...
You are SO fine.

252
00:16:41,303 --> 00:16:44,500
You merely tried jumping off a bridge.
Five minutes ago.

253
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,950
If I gave you my life
would you know what to do with it?

254
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,300
Give a carrot to a donkey,
you'll see if he knows what to do with it.

255
00:16:59,301 --> 00:17:03,450
Of course.
Of course I'd know what to do with it.

256
00:17:03,451 --> 00:17:08,400
Okay. Agreed.
I am yours.

257
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,800
You gotta be kidding!

258
00:17:11,801 --> 00:17:14,350
Not at all.
What you said makes a lot of sense.

259
00:17:14,351 --> 00:17:17,450
You're right :
you are a good cause.

260
00:17:17,451 --> 00:17:19,900
I am yours.

261
00:17:19,901 --> 00:17:21,199
You're making fun of me.

262
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,960
Not at all.
Can we start by buying some smokes?

263
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,550
You mean you're going to stay next to me?

264
00:17:28,551 --> 00:17:32,100
Yeah. I will do whatever you ask.
Without arguing.

265
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,350
You really are making fun of me.

266
00:17:35,351 --> 00:17:37,500
No.
Try me.

267
00:17:37,501 --> 00:17:38,501
Kiss me.

268
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Again?

269
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:52,700
No, that's good enough.
I believe you.

270
00:17:52,701 --> 00:17:55,000
So, are we going to get smokes?

271
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,000
First, we need to dry ourselves.

272
00:17:59,001 --> 00:18:00,001
Cool!

273
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:18,500
All done.
Now, give me your panties.

274
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,450
Come one... don't be shy.
I have just dried mine.

275
00:18:22,451 --> 00:18:25,500
I can tell you, it feels better now.
Much warmer.

276
00:18:24,501 --> 00:18:26,800
I just told you : I'm fine.

277
00:18:26,801 --> 00:18:27,801
Okay.

278
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,550
You know... it's the ladie's room here.

279
00:18:33,551 --> 00:18:34,551
Yeah?

280
00:18:34,552 --> 00:18:37,100
Yes, so can you tell this man
to go wash somewhere else?

281
00:18:37,101 --> 00:18:38,101
Who?

282
00:18:38,102 --> 00:18:40,650
Here! The man in that stall.
To whom you have handed a pair or pants.

283
00:18:40,651 --> 00:18:44,750
Don't judge a book by its cover : it's a woman.

284
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,050
Yeah? With that kind of voice?

285
00:18:47,051 --> 00:18:51,200
It's a women on the inside.
The outside doesn't matter.

286
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,700
What's going on?

287
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,800
Nothing, just chatting between women.

288
00:18:57,801 --> 00:18:59,750
So? What are we doing now?

289
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,850
Now, back to the business!

290
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:05,000
Good!
Can we get some food on the way?

291
00:19:05,001 --> 00:19:07,100
I could die for some breakfast.

292
00:19:07,101 --> 00:19:10,500
Avoid mentioning 'dying'.
Lately, I...

293
00:19:10,501 --> 00:19:11,299
Okay.

294
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,002
Thank you.

295
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:25,600
I'm sorry... Can you move away from me?
I'm not used to that.

296
00:19:25,601 --> 00:19:26,401
Okay.

297
00:19:26,402 --> 00:19:28,700
And can you stop replying 'okay',
whenever I ask you something?

298
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:29,701
Okay.

299
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,250
You want a half?

300
00:19:40,251 --> 00:19:41,500
No, thanks.
I'm not hungry.

301
00:19:41,501 --> 00:19:44,500
Eat. You need strength,
if you want to leave.

302
00:19:44,501 --> 00:19:46,700
Look, this one is going to the South!

303
00:19:46,701 --> 00:19:48,500
I love the South!

304
00:19:48,501 --> 00:19:50,050
Me too.

305
00:19:50,051 --> 00:19:52,200
Really. At one point I was dreaming of living over there.
But I...

306
00:19:52,201 --> 00:19:53,201
Why didn't you move?

307
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,400
Someday, maybe.

308
00:19:55,401 --> 00:19:56,700
Why not today?

309
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,600
No. Today is not a good idea.

310
00:19:59,601 --> 00:20:02,500
It is! Let's take the train right now.
And go to the beach.

311
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:03,501
Together.

312
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:08,650
You know that song?

313
00:20:08,651 --> 00:20:09,651
Entirely.

314
00:20:09,652 --> 00:20:10,652
So? Are we going?

315
00:20:10,653 --> 00:20:11,300
Where?

316
00:20:11,301 --> 00:20:12,654
To the South!

317
00:20:12,355 --> 00:20:16,450
But... we can't go to the South
simply because you want to.

318
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,450
Anyway, I have some issues to take care of.

319
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:20,550
Issues?
Can I help you?

320
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,400
Yeah... maybe.

321
00:20:24,401 --> 00:20:26,250
Awesome! What should I do?

322
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,900
Nothing.
Just stay next to me.

323
00:20:28,901 --> 00:20:29,901
That will be enough?

324
00:20:29,902 --> 00:20:32,755
Yeah.
That way they're going to believe that...

325
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,700
That we...
That we're together.

326
00:20:37,701 --> 00:20:39,050
And that's going to impress them.

327
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,800
They are going to start respecting me.
See what I mean?

328
00:20:42,801 --> 00:20:43,801
Not at all.

329
00:20:43,802 --> 00:20:45,100
That's normal.

330
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,850
First, Monsieur Frank, I thank you for seeing us.
I know you have better things to do...

331
00:20:49,851 --> 00:20:50,501
Cut the crap!

332
00:20:50,502 --> 00:20:51,502
Right.

333
00:20:51,503 --> 00:20:54,300
Listen. I know I owe you money.

334
00:20:54,301 --> 00:20:57,100
For you, it's not much.
But for me, it's an extraordinary amount.

335
00:20:57,101 --> 00:21:00,000
I am waiting for some cash sometime soon,
from my Argentina businesses, but...

336
00:21:00,001 --> 00:21:01,001
What kind of businesses?

337
00:21:01,002 --> 00:21:03,200
Uh... olive oil.

338
00:21:03,201 --> 00:21:04,400
Olive oil?

339
00:21:04,401 --> 00:21:06,500
It's winter over there.
No olive oil before five months.

340
00:21:06,501 --> 00:21:07,900
That's what you call 'sometime soon' ?

341
00:21:07,901 --> 00:21:10,500
True.
But I'm relying on stocks from... this month.

342
00:21:10,501 --> 00:21:12,350
But everything was stolen.

343
00:21:12,351 --> 00:21:15,450
People are starving so badly, over there.

344
00:21:15,451 --> 00:21:17,850
On the other hand, stealing olive oil...
it's ridiculous.

345
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,550
Who's that girl?

346
00:21:23,551 --> 00:21:24,551
Who?

347
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:27,900
Her?

348
00:21:27,901 --> 00:21:30,850
She's my associate.
Speaking of which, Frankie, I got to tell you...

349
00:21:30,851 --> 00:21:31,499
Frankie?

350
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,110
Sorry.

351
00:21:32,111 --> 00:21:33,579
Watch it...

352
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:36,854
I was thinking : you can't pay Frank back.
No need to hide it. You can't...

353
00:21:36,855 --> 00:21:41,550
At least, offer him a share of the pie.
I swear, Frank. It's a golden opportunity.

354
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:44,150
Whatever you're offering,
I'm not interested.

355
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,650
Why?
We used to have good deals.

356
00:21:48,651 --> 00:21:50,500
You're a loser, Andre.
Whatever you try, fails.

357
00:21:50,501 --> 00:21:53,400
The few times when you made money
that was just luck.

358
00:21:53,401 --> 00:21:55,750
It's a wonder you managed to stay in one piece.

359
00:21:55,751 --> 00:21:57,100
Look at yourself.

360
00:21:57,101 --> 00:21:58,900
You look like a bum.
You stink.

361
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:01,450
People wouldn't even give you a penny.

362
00:22:01,451 --> 00:22:04,100
I'm sorry, Frank.
I didn't have the time to shave.

363
00:22:04,101 --> 00:22:07,000
Yesterday, I spent my time struggling to find a solution.

364
00:22:07,001 --> 00:22:08,500
I swear, when you hit rock bottom...

365
00:22:08,501 --> 00:22:09,751
Cut the theatrics, Andre!

366
00:22:09,752 --> 00:22:11,950
It's your fault, if you're in that situation.

367
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,300
Well, then. I'm giving you six more hours
to find my 30 grands.

368
00:22:19,301 --> 00:22:21,650
If you fail, I'm sending two Yugos on your ass.
Is that clear?

369
00:22:21,651 --> 00:22:23,250
Two Yugos?

370
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:25,050
Or two Bosnians, if you want.

371
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:31,150
I only have one condition...

372
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:38,730
Don't you have a little job?
Even a shitty one. I can take it...

373
00:22:38,731 --> 00:22:40,990
I think I know what he wants.

374
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:46,500
Got a second, Monsieur Frank?

375
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,650
You were supposed to shut up during this meeting.
Are you trying to screw things up, or what?

376
00:22:50,651 --> 00:22:53,950
As if you needed me to screw up.
You're negotiating like a white chick.

377
00:22:53,951 --> 00:22:55,100
Like a white chick?

378
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,600
Why don't you give him what he wants?
Don't beat around the bush.

379
00:22:58,601 --> 00:22:59,601
Around the bush?

380
00:22:59,602 --> 00:23:00,602
Uh uh.

381
00:23:00,603 --> 00:23:03,800
Listen, Angela. You shut up for a minute.
Let me sort this business out. I'm back in a sec.

382
00:23:03,801 --> 00:23:04,800
What a 'business'...

383
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:06,900
Damn... shut up!
You shut up.

384
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,700
We were saying?

385
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,600
Monsieur Frank!

386
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,100
Monsieur Frank!

387
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,450
Why don't you let your girlfriend talk?
She seems smarter than you.

388
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:28,400
Well, then... no problem.

389
00:23:28,401 --> 00:23:31,500
If you want to chat with her.
Since we're associates...

390
00:23:31,501 --> 00:23:32,950
If you're talking to me,
it's as if you were talking to her.

391
00:23:32,951 --> 00:23:35,650
There's no...
Angela, will you please discuss with my friend?

392
00:23:35,651 --> 00:23:37,750
Where do you want to do it?

393
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,800
I've got a small lounge, right upstairs.
We won't be disturbed.

394
00:23:40,801 --> 00:23:41,801
Fine.

395
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,300
You're unbelievable, you...

396
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:01,500
Angela! Angela...
That guy is a killer. He's gonna mess with your head.

397
00:24:01,501 --> 00:24:03,500
Shhhh...
Let me handle this.

398
00:24:03,501 --> 00:24:06,250
I'm going to make him
an offer he can't refuse.

399
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,300
Be nice.

400
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,650
Where have you been?
I've been waiting for an hour!

401
00:24:21,651 --> 00:24:24,250
It didn't take an hour. I stayed for five minutes.
It all went very well.

402
00:24:24,251 --> 00:24:27,300
You don't realize, poor girl.
That guy is a killer!

403
00:24:27,301 --> 00:24:29,300
He could as well have killed you.

404
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:33,250
I guess I got lucky, then.
Here... It's for you.

405
00:24:33,251 --> 00:24:34,251
What is that?

406
00:24:34,252 --> 00:24:36,000
Paper.
With pictures on it.

407
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,500
It is called 'money'.

408
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,350
And my debts?

409
00:24:40,351 --> 00:24:43,450
You don't owe him anything anymore.
He wiped your slate clean.

410
00:24:43,451 --> 00:24:45,680
You're white as snow, now.
You can breathe.

411
00:24:45,681 --> 00:24:48,500
And take the time you need
to feel better again.

412
00:24:48,501 --> 00:24:50,800
Angela. What have you done?
Did you sell your mother, or what?

413
00:24:50,801 --> 00:24:51,450
Of course not.

414
00:24:51,451 --> 00:24:52,882
Wait. Tell me.

415
00:24:52,883 --> 00:24:55,320
Ah. Why do you care?
You had a problem...

416
00:24:55,321 --> 00:24:56,680
and it's solved.
Now, look ahead of you.

417
00:24:56,681 --> 00:24:59,050
Move forwards, now.

418
00:24:59,051 --> 00:25:02,500
Wait. I'm not moving anywhere.
I don't want any dirty money.

419
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,100
What do you mean by 'dirty money' ?

420
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:06,300
If you did nasty stuff...
then I don't want it.

421
00:25:06,301 --> 00:25:10,350
When you take money from an ATM
do you wonder where it comes from?

422
00:25:10,351 --> 00:25:12,650
It's coming from the machine.
And I'm fine with that.

423
00:25:12,651 --> 00:25:14,700
Well... today I am the ATM.

424
00:25:14,701 --> 00:25:17,900
BEEP Take your money.
And stop bitching about it.

425
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,200
Actually, it helps me a lot.

426
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,450
How much is there?

427
00:25:24,451 --> 00:25:26,500
Enough to repay the Spaniard.

428
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,450
That's so great!

429
00:25:31,325 --> 00:25:33,100
How do you know I owe
money to the Spaniard?

430
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,050
Everybody knows about your debts,
my poor Andre...

431
00:25:36,051 --> 00:25:37,051
I don't want it anymore!

432
00:25:37,052 --> 00:25:38,052
Why don't you?

433
00:25:38,053 --> 00:25:40,650
Because I'm convinced you've done
nasty things with Frank.

434
00:25:40,651 --> 00:25:42,300
I'm not a pimp.
You hear me?

435
00:25:42,301 --> 00:25:43,100
Nonsense!

436
00:25:43,101 --> 00:25:45,000
Yes, sense!
Give me that...

437
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,500
Wait... Do you think I didn't see you
dancing in front of him?

438
00:25:48,501 --> 00:25:49,501
Dancing, me?

439
00:25:49,502 --> 00:25:51,300
You kept showing him your panties.
I saw it!

440
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:52,301
You have eyes behind your back?

441
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:55,300
I noticed he wasn't focused on
what I was saying.

442
00:25:55,301 --> 00:25:58,000
What you were saying
wasn't really interesting...

443
00:25:58,001 --> 00:25:59,400
I was talking business, okay?

444
00:25:59,401 --> 00:26:02,450
Business has its code, its own language.
It's mostly body language.

445
00:26:02,451 --> 00:26:05,200
You got to look weak one moment,
so as to catch your prey unaware!

446
00:26:05,201 --> 00:26:06,900
But you're not fishing trout, Andre.

447
00:26:06,901 --> 00:26:10,000
You're dealing with a crook.
Behaving like a grade school student...

448
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:12,450
At least I have some pride left.
A few principles.

449
00:26:12,451 --> 00:26:13,451
Probably too much for you.

450
00:26:13,452 --> 00:26:15,850
Then why didn't use your principles?

451
00:26:15,851 --> 00:26:17,500
Frank was like a marshmallow, today.

452
00:26:17,501 --> 00:26:19,550
You could have asked for 10 grands. Easy...

453
00:26:19,551 --> 00:26:20,551
Never.

454
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,350
I considered it.

455
00:26:22,351 --> 00:26:25,800
You know... brains are large.
You can use more than this tiny piece.

456
00:26:25,801 --> 00:26:28,450
You are so wrong, poor girl.
I'm using all of it. All!

457
00:26:28,451 --> 00:26:30,500
I think all the time.

458
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:32,550
Right now, I'm thinking
you should leave me alone.

459
00:26:32,551 --> 00:26:34,600
But you're thinking small.
Paying small debts.

460
00:26:34,601 --> 00:26:37,100
Buying a small plane ticket.
To quickly go to New York...

461
00:26:37,101 --> 00:26:39,150
So as to sell your Brooklyn apartment.

462
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,550
How come you know about my Brooklyn penthouse?

463
00:26:44,551 --> 00:26:46,400
You call this hole a penthouse?

464
00:26:46,401 --> 00:26:48,850
It was cheap when I bought it,
but since then the price must have increased...

465
00:26:48,851 --> 00:26:50,980
Who cares about your Brooklyn apartment?

466
00:26:50,981 --> 00:26:54,450
It's not the problem. Your problem is
that all you want is to run away.

467
00:26:54,451 --> 00:26:56,600
All the time...
Instead of taking a break.

468
00:26:56,601 --> 00:26:58,850
Instead of breathing.

469
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:03,000
Letting oxygen climb up to your brain.
Making it happy.

470
00:27:03,001 --> 00:27:05,650
So that it helps you take the right decisions.

471
00:27:05,651 --> 00:27:07,850
Now, breathe!

472
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,450
Breathe...

473
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,200
Breathe!

474
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,000
Good... Look.
Come here.

475
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,500
Lift up your head.

476
00:27:17,501 --> 00:27:18,501
Breathe.

477
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:21,450
Breathe.

478
00:27:21,451 --> 00:27:22,451
There... look.

479
00:27:22,452 --> 00:27:23,452
Breathe!

480
00:27:23,453 --> 00:27:26,500
Look.
There...

481
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,300
The clouds...

482
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:30,850
The birds...

483
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,200
The city...

484
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:35,150
All around us.

485
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,350
Breathe.

486
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,950
Is it not the most beautiful
city in the world?

487
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:49,300
So, how should I have handled Frank?

488
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,650
By telling him the truth.
That's all.

489
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,450
What truth?

490
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,500
The only one you don't want to hear.

491
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,150
The money I owe you is dirty.
Coming mostly from sex and drugs.

492
00:28:04,151 --> 00:28:07,050
I'll never return it
because I don't want to be part of that shit.

493
00:28:07,051 --> 00:28:11,150
Anyway, I'll never see your ugly face again.
I won't lose any more time with scum like you.

494
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,350
Bravo, Andre!

495
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,300
You really think I should have said that?

496
00:28:15,301 --> 00:28:16,800
Isn't that what you were thinking?

497
00:28:16,801 --> 00:28:18,700
We can't always say what we think, Angela.

498
00:28:18,701 --> 00:28:20,600
Why not?
Maybe life would be better that way.

499
00:28:20,601 --> 00:28:23,000
And we'd have the time to enjoy Paris.

500
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:25,200
Oh!
Do you think we can ride the tourist boats?

501
00:28:25,201 --> 00:28:27,250
It's not the right time to ride
the damned tourist boats...

502
00:28:27,251 --> 00:28:29,200
Ah?
And when is the right time?

503
00:28:29,201 --> 00:28:30,750
When you are free from stress.

504
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:33,000
Right now, I'm not free from any stress at all.

505
00:28:33,001 --> 00:28:35,000
Come on, it's only five minutes.

506
00:28:35,001 --> 00:28:36,001
Stop that!

507
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:38,000
I can't swim, anyway...

508
00:28:38,001 --> 00:28:39,800
Liar.
You jumped off the bridge to save me.

509
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,000
It was different. I was not thinking.

510
00:28:41,001 --> 00:28:43,000
Now that I'm thinking,
I remember I can't swim.

511
00:28:43,001 --> 00:28:45,000
Come on... please.
To make me happy...

512
00:28:45,001 --> 00:28:46,910
No, no, no!
Do not insist.

513
00:28:46,911 --> 00:28:48,600
When I say no, I mean it.

514
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:56,000
I've always dreamt of riding a tourist boat,
like that, on the Seine.

515
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,100
It's so romantic!

516
00:28:58,101 --> 00:28:59,500
I'm feeling sick...

517
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:00,501
I'm happy, Andre.

518
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,900
Right here, right now.

519
00:29:02,901 --> 00:29:04,500
At this precise instant...

520
00:29:04,501 --> 00:29:06,300
you're saving my life.

521
00:29:06,301 --> 00:29:07,301
Making my dreams come true.

522
00:29:07,302 --> 00:29:09,500
See?
You can do good things.

523
00:29:09,501 --> 00:29:11,000
Yes, but it only works on you.

524
00:29:11,001 --> 00:29:13,400
We should come back at night too.
It's so pretty at night.

525
00:29:13,401 --> 00:29:14,700
No. This time, we won't.

526
00:29:14,701 --> 00:29:16,900
The boats are lit up with these spotlights.

527
00:29:16,901 --> 00:29:17,901
And when you see them from above...

528
00:29:17,902 --> 00:29:19,850
watching them winding upriver is so pretty.

529
00:29:19,851 --> 00:29:22,100
They look like small balls of light,
gliding over the water.

530
00:29:22,101 --> 00:29:23,300
What do you mean, 'from above' ?

531
00:29:23,301 --> 00:29:25,450
Above! From the sky.

532
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:33,210
Come on.
Relax a little.

533
00:29:33,211 --> 00:29:34,820
You're so tense...

534
00:29:34,821 --> 00:29:36,600
It gives you all these small wrinkles.

535
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:38,800
Here.
You look like a turtle.

536
00:29:38,801 --> 00:29:40,520
It's easy for you.
You never had trouble with money..

537
00:29:40,521 --> 00:29:42,050
No, I never had any.

538
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:43,451
Any what?

539
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,500
Trouble or money?

540
00:29:44,501 --> 00:29:45,501
Both.

541
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:49,900
Good for you, really...
But I still have a problem with both.

542
00:29:49,901 --> 00:29:52,550
But you have money, now.
You can pay what you owe.

543
00:29:52,551 --> 00:29:55,350
You seem to be misinformed.
I owe much more than that to the Spaniard.

544
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,900
No big deal.
Let's go get more dough.

545
00:29:57,901 --> 00:29:59,690
... get more dough...

546
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,990
You think it's easy,
getting more dough?

547
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,900
I made 20,000 Euros in five minutes.

548
00:30:04,901 --> 00:30:05,901
It's not the same.
Not at all.

549
00:30:05,902 --> 00:30:08,600
Yes it is!
How much do you need to be happy?

550
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,500
What are you talking about?

551
00:30:10,501 --> 00:30:12,000
Your debt...
How much is it?

552
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:14,099
Total?

553
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,050
Yes.
Not broken down.

554
00:30:15,051 --> 00:30:17,300
I have no idea.
I swear... I don't know.

555
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:21,000
Thirty...
Thirty five...

556
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:23,000
With interest that must be around 50,000.

557
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,500
I'm so screwed.

558
00:30:24,501 --> 00:30:26,700
50 is no big deal.

559
00:30:26,701 --> 00:30:28,100
Come on, let's go.

560
00:30:28,101 --> 00:30:29,101
Where?

561
00:30:29,102 --> 00:30:30,900
Where there is music.

562
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,250
What for?

563
00:30:32,251 --> 00:30:34,250
Because I like music when I'm working.

564
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,000
How're you doing?

565
00:30:46,001 --> 00:30:46,799
Fine.

566
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,050
Say... would you like to screw in the bathroom?

567
00:30:49,051 --> 00:30:52,900
Wow, you're quite a straight chick...
Can I know your name, first?

568
00:30:52,901 --> 00:30:55,100
You won't need it.
So?

569
00:30:55,801 --> 00:30:56,300
Okay.

570
00:30:56,301 --> 00:30:57,950
How much are you willing to pay?

571
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,500
Ah... I see.
Why should I pay?

572
00:31:00,501 --> 00:31:03,150
What you don't pay
has no value.

573
00:31:03,151 --> 00:31:04,500
It's kind of true...

574
00:31:04,501 --> 00:31:05,900
So? How much?

575
00:31:08,501 --> 00:31:10,700
1,000 !
And you get the full monty.

576
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,200
Okay. Deal.

577
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,430
Here you go : 1,000.

578
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:31,431
What's that?

579
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,700
The girl... the tall blonde.
She told me to give it to you.

580
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:00,950
Angela?

581
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:09,650
Angela?

582
00:32:09,651 --> 00:32:10,651
What?

583
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:14,950
What're you doing?

584
00:32:14,951 --> 00:32:15,951
Guess...

585
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:19,650
Angela, you can't be doing this.
I don't want...

586
00:32:19,651 --> 00:32:21,250
I don't want you to do this for me!

587
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,120
I thought you needed money...

588
00:32:24,121 --> 00:32:26,250
Yes... Yes, I need it.
But...

589
00:32:26,251 --> 00:32:29,600
Listen, I still have some morality left.
I don't want you to be doing this for me.

590
00:32:29,601 --> 00:32:32,450
No way...
I thank you very much for it.

591
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,750
I appreciate the gesture.
But no. Really.

592
00:32:34,751 --> 00:32:36,000
No way you're doing this at all.

593
00:32:36,001 --> 00:32:37,800
Come on. It's all right.
It's nothing.

594
00:32:37,801 --> 00:32:39,900
Yes it's something!
What are you talking about?

595
00:32:39,901 --> 00:32:40,901
Of course it's something!

596
00:32:40,902 --> 00:32:43,350
Listen, Angela.
Stop immediately, and come out right now!

597
00:32:43,351 --> 00:32:46,049
Listen... let's say I'm doing it for myself.
Okay?

598
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:49,300
I simply need you to keep the money,
to prevent me from spending it all.

599
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:51,850
Listen...
I'm not feeling well, Angela...

600
00:32:51,851 --> 00:32:53,450
Please come out, and let's go away.

601
00:32:53,451 --> 00:32:56,050
Now, she's asking you to keep her dough.
So keep it and give us a break!

602
00:32:56,051 --> 00:32:57,051
So that I can finish. Fuck!

603
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:04,250
Angela... really.
I feel terrible, leaving you like that.

604
00:33:04,251 --> 00:33:08,950
Andre... go to the bar.
I don't want to spend the night here, okay?

605
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,800
I'm off to the bar, now.

606
00:33:16,801 --> 00:33:17,801
Go!

607
00:34:11,935 --> 00:34:12,935
Thank you, sir.

608
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:17,950
Hey! That one was...

609
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,030
I got 500. Is that okay?

610
00:34:46,031 --> 00:34:47,450
It's finished, it's over.

611
00:34:47,451 --> 00:34:49,650
Come on, don't be cheap.
Only five minutes!

612
00:34:49,651 --> 00:34:52,150
I just told you it's over!

613
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,450
Isn't that your third time?

614
00:34:54,451 --> 00:34:55,451
Ah, no... uh!
Not at all!

615
00:34:55,452 --> 00:34:56,452
Not a single time.

616
00:34:56,453 --> 00:34:58,050
I've spent three hours waiting for my turn.

617
00:34:58,051 --> 00:34:59,051
Come on, be nice!

618
00:34:59,052 --> 00:35:01,250
Here, have 1,000.

619
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,900
I don't give a fuck about your dough.
I just told you the girl is tired.

620
00:35:04,901 --> 00:35:07,000
Tired... tired...
Everybody went on top of her.

621
00:35:07,001 --> 00:35:09,100
One more is not going
to make any difference.

622
00:35:09,101 --> 00:35:10,101
Yes it will!

623
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,350
It's one too many.
At last I understand.

624
00:35:13,351 --> 00:35:14,351
Understand what?

625
00:35:14,352 --> 00:35:16,200
I don't want her to be sullied!

626
00:35:16,201 --> 00:35:18,550
Especially if it's to make me happy.

627
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I'm not worth it.

628
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,800
I really don't want to have
anything to do with assholes like you.

629
00:35:25,801 --> 00:35:29,200
Now get the fuck away,
or I'm going to get really mad.

630
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:34,200
See what I get for telling the truth?
You and your lousy advice...

631
00:35:34,201 --> 00:35:36,050
You didn't have to be rude.

632
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:38,450
And the stuff about his mother
was uncalled for.

633
00:35:38,451 --> 00:35:40,000
It came naturally...

634
00:35:40,001 --> 00:35:41,950
Good.
There's some improvement.

635
00:35:41,951 --> 00:35:43,650
You spoke your heart out.

636
00:35:43,651 --> 00:35:46,150
If I get my ass kicked whenever I speak my mind,
I'll be dead before tomorrow morning.

637
00:35:46,151 --> 00:35:48,300
You're always complaining.
Did you notice that?

638
00:35:48,301 --> 00:35:50,200
Did you see the evening
you had me go through, Angela?

639
00:35:50,201 --> 00:35:52,850
Standing at the bar, playing the pimp.
I'm ashamed.

640
00:35:52,851 --> 00:35:54,450
Would you rather have been in my shoes?

641
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,800
No.

642
00:35:58,801 --> 00:35:59,801
Then shut up.

643
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:04,400
Anyway. I thought having your money
would make you feel better.

644
00:36:04,401 --> 00:36:05,750
It's in your pocket now.

645
00:36:05,751 --> 00:36:07,400
What are you waiting for, before you smile?

646
00:36:07,401 --> 00:36:09,050
I need to pay my debt first.

647
00:36:09,051 --> 00:36:10,800
I'll smile afterwards.

648
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,150
Open!

649
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,000
What're you looking at, bitch?
Open!

650
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,600
Okay. You stay next to me.
Just in case...

651
00:36:28,601 --> 00:36:30,750
In case I have to pull you out
of a tricky negotiation ?

652
00:36:30,751 --> 00:36:32,400
Why do you keep humiliating me?

653
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:33,401
You don't need me for that...

654
00:36:33,402 --> 00:36:35,350
See? You're doing it again!
Stop treating me like that.

655
00:36:35,351 --> 00:36:36,900
I'm treating you
like you treat me.

656
00:36:36,901 --> 00:36:37,920
I should have let you drown.

657
00:36:37,921 --> 00:36:38,619
What?

658
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,003
Nothing!

659
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,900
No, no, no!

660
00:36:54,901 --> 00:36:56,620
Don't start dancing again!
I've had enough shame.

661
00:36:56,621 --> 00:36:57,750
It's over.
No more dancing.

662
00:36:57,751 --> 00:36:58,050
Okay.

663
00:36:58,051 --> 00:36:59,250
Don't do it again.

664
00:36:59,250 --> 00:36:59,659
Okay.

665
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,319
I'm a big shot, here.

666
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,320
Okay.

667
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,350
How many times do I have to tell you?
Wash your hands before touching it.

668
00:37:16,351 --> 00:37:19,000
It's worth a fortune.
One month...

669
00:37:19,001 --> 00:37:20,001
Pedro!

670
00:37:20,002 --> 00:37:22,750
... and it's already filthy.
You want to ruin me, that's it?

671
00:37:22,751 --> 00:37:28,400
Pedro!
Ho! Que pasa, Pedro?

672
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:34,400
Ho, Pedro!
Como esta?

673
00:37:34,401 --> 00:37:37,500
Quite ballsy, coming to my club like that...
Have you forgotten?

674
00:37:37,501 --> 00:37:40,450
No. I had to take a trip to Argentina.
And my cellphone doesn't work over there.

675
00:37:40,451 --> 00:37:41,451
What were you doing over there?

676
00:37:41,452 --> 00:37:42,452
I have a small business.
Didn't I tell you?

677
00:37:42,453 --> 00:37:42,999
No.

678
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,744
Well, I'm telling you.

679
00:37:43,745 --> 00:37:46,210
Good.
That way you can pay me back.

680
00:37:46,211 --> 00:37:48,300
That's why I came back.

681
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,025
Wait... really?

682
00:37:49,025 --> 00:37:50,025
Yup!

683
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,550
This is amazing.

684
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:54,000
You want a drink?

685
00:37:54,001 --> 00:37:55,400
Well... it'd be a pleasure.

686
00:37:55,401 --> 00:37:56,401
What will you have?

687
00:37:56,402 --> 00:37:58,150
A quick vodka-tonic.
It's going to...

688
00:37:58,151 --> 00:37:59,151
What about your girlfriend?

689
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,100
Should I answer, or bark?

690
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:02,600
Answer, that's all.

691
00:38:02,601 --> 00:38:03,601
The same thing, please.

692
00:38:03,602 --> 00:38:06,290
Diego, please!
Two vodka-tonic for my friends.

693
00:38:06,291 --> 00:38:08,050
Say... your girlfriend...
she's pretty.

694
00:38:08,051 --> 00:38:09,051
Yeah, I know.

695
00:38:09,052 --> 00:38:11,420
We met... in Agentina.

696
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,300
Really?
She's rather blonde, for a Latina.

697
00:38:14,301 --> 00:38:18,100
Yeah... It's from her mother.
She's from Sweden. That's why.

698
00:38:18,101 --> 00:38:19,101
Really?

699
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,600
Should I answer in Spanish, or Swedish?

700
00:38:27,601 --> 00:38:29,400
Answer! Any...

701
00:38:40,425 --> 00:38:41,250
Well!

702
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:43,700
Short reckonings making long friends...
How much do I owe you?

703
00:38:43,701 --> 00:38:49,050
17,000? With interest that makes
something like 20,000 Euros.

704
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,700
Agreed?

705
00:38:50,701 --> 00:38:51,701
Agreed!

706
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:55,300
Andre, you know...
I'm removing all I ever said about you.

707
00:38:55,301 --> 00:38:56,550
And god knows I said a lot!

708
00:38:56,551 --> 00:38:58,600
You were right anyway, Pedro.
I didn't behave properly.

709
00:38:58,601 --> 00:39:00,300
I should have called you as soon as I knew
I would be a little late.

710
00:39:00,301 --> 00:39:02,500
Six months late?
That's not what I call 'a little'.

711
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,560
A little...

712
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,240
But it's true.
You should have called!

713
00:39:07,241 --> 00:39:08,241
Yes.

714
00:39:08,242 --> 00:39:08,950
Isn't it true?

715
00:39:08,951 --> 00:39:09,930
Yes. Yes.

716
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:13,190
Because it's always good
to have a friend on the phone.

717
00:39:14,025 --> 00:39:15,025
Really?

718
00:39:16,475 --> 00:39:17,840
How sweet of you!

719
00:39:17,841 --> 00:39:19,880
Moreover...
You seem in good shape!

720
00:39:19,881 --> 00:39:21,340
I'm feeling better, yeah...

721
00:39:21,341 --> 00:39:22,500
You seem more stable.

722
00:39:22,501 --> 00:39:24,750
Yes, it's true...
Ouch! Careful, careful...

723
00:39:24,751 --> 00:39:27,050
Initially I was not feeling good.
But now I'm better.

724
00:39:27,051 --> 00:39:30,200
Good! I can tell you now...
You were on a slippery slope.

725
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,120
Yes, I know... I know.

726
00:39:32,121 --> 00:39:35,420
I even know some guys who got contracts for your head.

727
00:39:35,421 --> 00:39:36,560
For real?

728
00:39:36,561 --> 00:39:38,115
I haven't told you anything, right?

729
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:42,160
Anyway, there's no point in getting contracts on my head.
I'd rather die than not paying my debts.

730
00:39:42,161 --> 00:39:43,250
You're exaggerating, aren't you?

731
00:39:43,251 --> 00:39:45,650
I swear it!
Yesterday morning, I...

732
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:47,660
I almost killed myself.

733
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:54,870
I... I went on a bridge.
I stepped over the railing.

734
00:39:54,871 --> 00:39:57,880
And I...
I almost jumped.

735
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,950
Don't fool around with that, Andre...

736
00:39:59,951 --> 00:40:02,350
You've got a girl, now.
She needs you, to build something...

737
00:40:02,351 --> 00:40:03,400
Don't give up on her.

738
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,980
No, I won't give her up.
You can trust me.

739
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:10,800
Hey! Let me give you a tip,
to get you started again.

740
00:40:13,155 --> 00:40:16,300
I've got a horse running in Miami, in 20 minutes.
The name's Brutus.

741
00:40:16,301 --> 00:40:17,301
His odds are 30 to 1.

742
00:40:17,302 --> 00:40:20,200
I got a guy over there,
who added bromide in the three favourite's grub.

743
00:40:20,201 --> 00:40:21,750
They're gonna drag themselves like donkeys.

744
00:40:21,751 --> 00:40:24,430
My horse, on the other hand,
is loaded with amphetamines.

745
00:40:24,431 --> 00:40:25,990
He's going to kick their asses.

746
00:40:25,991 --> 00:40:27,950
But what if they block the winnings
and have a drug test?

747
00:40:27,951 --> 00:40:29,350
They're all on my payroll...

748
00:40:29,351 --> 00:40:33,300
Brutus, number 7 in the third race. 30 to 1.
Can you smell the cash?

749
00:40:33,301 --> 00:40:34,099
I can.

750
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,730
But be careful...
It's just for you, Andy boy.

751
00:40:35,731 --> 00:40:36,449
No problem.

752
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:38,200
Don't you cause the odds to drop
right before it starts...

753
00:40:38,201 --> 00:40:39,570
No no no! I swear, Pedro.
Trust me.

754
00:40:39,571 --> 00:40:42,830
Well... Consider it my gift.
Now that you're back in business.

755
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:46,450
Thank you. Thank you, Pedro.
Really...

756
00:40:46,451 --> 00:40:50,600
Brutus, number 7 in the third race.
Have a blast, Andy boy!

757
00:40:50,601 --> 00:40:51,250
Thank you.

758
00:40:51,251 --> 00:40:53,800
Diego!
All drinks from my friend Andre and his partner are on me.

759
00:40:53,801 --> 00:40:54,801
Senorita...

760
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,650
Did you see that? Wow! Like I said...
When you're next to me, they are impressed.

761
00:40:59,651 --> 00:41:01,050
Pepito gobbled it all!

762
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:03,750
Okay. What are we doing now?

763
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:06,330
Now, we're off to make shitloads of cash!

764
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:22,250
Miami in the third race.
Everything on number 7. Brutus!

765
00:41:22,251 --> 00:41:23,800
I have a feeling you're going to lose my money.

766
00:41:23,801 --> 00:41:25,900
Trust me.
I'm going to repay you three times the price, honey.

767
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,860
Haha! Thanks!

768
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:33,060
Come. I'm going to show you.

769
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:35,800
Miami?

770
00:41:35,801 --> 00:41:36,000
Yes.

771
00:41:36,001 --> 00:41:37,001
Hehe!

772
00:41:39,777 --> 00:41:41,830
Go, my horse!
Go! Go! Go! Yes!

773
00:41:41,831 --> 00:41:43,820
He's first!
He's first! Hell yeah!

774
00:41:43,821 --> 00:41:45,890
He was right...
He's first!

775
00:41:49,335 --> 00:41:51,215
Go, my horse!
Yeah!

776
00:41:51,216 --> 00:41:52,955
Yeah! He's first!
Do you realize?

777
00:41:52,956 --> 00:41:54,550
The Spaniard was right!

778
00:41:54,551 --> 00:41:56,700
Keep up with the race!
Keep it up! Yeah!

779
00:41:56,701 --> 00:41:58,130
Yeah yeah yeah!
That's no big deal.

780
00:41:58,131 --> 00:41:59,131
He's slowing down, it's normal.

781
00:41:59,132 --> 00:42:00,132
He's breathing before returning...

782
00:42:00,133 --> 00:42:01,133
Go, my horse, go!

783
00:42:02,215 --> 00:42:04,700
What's going on?
It's an American technique.

784
00:42:04,701 --> 00:42:07,350
He's breathing... breathing.
And then he's going to run for it!

785
00:42:07,351 --> 00:42:08,690
He's gonna run for it.
Like lightning. I'm sure.

786
00:42:08,691 --> 00:42:09,960
Give it all!
Come back!

787
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:11,680
Go for it!
Go!

788
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,900
Why is he slowing down?

789
00:42:13,901 --> 00:42:15,800
He's slowing down too much...

790
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,020
Why is he walking?

791
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,700
They... they told us number 7.

792
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,460
The Spaniard told me to bet everything on number 7.

793
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,400
I bet everything on number 7.

794
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,480
Number 1 won.

795
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:47,250
I've lost it all.

796
00:42:47,251 --> 00:42:49,715
With that kind of name,
you should have been careful.

797
00:42:49,716 --> 00:42:50,716
How so?

798
00:42:50,717 --> 00:42:56,450
Well. Brutus. Caesar's son.
The one who murdered him, stabbed in the back.

799
00:42:56,451 --> 00:42:57,800
Why didn't you tell me before?

800
00:42:57,801 --> 00:42:59,220
You should have paid attention in school.

801
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:01,850
Of course.

802
00:43:01,851 --> 00:43:05,600
Why do you keep smoking?
Can you tell me?

803
00:43:05,601 --> 00:43:08,150
Because where I live,
we are not allowed to smoke.

804
00:43:08,151 --> 00:43:10,385
Even secretly...
So I'm catching up with it.

805
00:43:10,386 --> 00:43:12,880
It's cancer that's gonna catch up with you...
You won't see it coming. Give me that!

806
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:14,850
Hmm... okay.

807
00:43:14,851 --> 00:43:16,220
Are we going for breakfast?

808
00:43:16,221 --> 00:43:17,950
Not a chance...
I don't have any cash left.

809
00:43:17,951 --> 00:43:23,000
No problem. I kept one bill
For cases when business is bad.

810
00:43:23,001 --> 00:43:24,001
Give me that!

811
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:26,510
This neighbourhood is not very safe.

812
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:30,580
Thank you.

813
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,745
'A gift now that you're back in business'
What a fucking joke...

814
00:43:34,746 --> 00:43:35,946
I'm so surprised...

815
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:37,570
Hmm... me too.

816
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:41,610
There are no croissants either, where you live?

817
00:43:41,611 --> 00:43:44,820
Uh uh.
Did Didier ever make you a gift, before?

818
00:43:44,821 --> 00:43:45,821
Of course not.

819
00:43:45,822 --> 00:43:49,600
So, why did you decide that
he could make you one this time?

820
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:51,500
I don't know.
I bought it.

821
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:53,600
Because he flattered you.

822
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:56,500
Yeah, okay. He flattered me and I fell for it.
Satisfied?

823
00:43:56,501 --> 00:43:59,600
Since you don't have much self esteem,
whenever you are flattered, you dive.

824
00:43:59,601 --> 00:44:00,500
I dive?

825
00:44:00,501 --> 00:44:01,501
Hmm hmm.

826
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:04,580
You were glad when I dived for you, last time.
You seemed less satisfied with yourself...

827
00:44:04,581 --> 00:44:08,000
Why do you keep busting my balls, since yesterday?
With your lousy moral...

828
00:44:08,001 --> 00:44:10,130
Who are you anyway?
How come you fell in my life?

829
00:44:10,131 --> 00:44:13,250
I didn't fall in your life.
I fell from the sky.

830
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:16,180
No, you fell from a bridge.
I was there, remember?

831
00:44:16,181 --> 00:44:17,950
I was there too, smartypants.
I'm talking about before...

832
00:44:17,951 --> 00:44:19,840
Before, I fell from the sky.

833
00:44:19,841 --> 00:44:22,010
What do you mean 'fell from the sky' ?

834
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:23,050
From a plane?

835
00:44:23,051 --> 00:44:24,500
No, from the sky.

836
00:44:24,501 --> 00:44:25,501
Up There.

837
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,490
That's where I live.

838
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:43,200
I'm an angel.
If you prefer.

839
00:44:43,201 --> 00:44:44,201
An angel?

840
00:44:44,202 --> 00:44:47,400
Yes. A real one. Coming from the sky.
With great white wings and all that...

841
00:44:47,401 --> 00:44:48,401
Uh yeah?

842
00:44:48,402 --> 00:44:50,150
And where are your great white wings and all that?

843
00:44:50,151 --> 00:44:52,400
You don't expect me to unfold them here,
in the middle of the cafe.

844
00:44:52,401 --> 00:44:53,550
A chainsmoking angel?

845
00:44:53,551 --> 00:44:56,250
What do you care, if I smoke?
I'm immortal.

846
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,100
Okay then.
You're an angel.

847
00:44:59,101 --> 00:45:00,750
I'm open-minded.
You're an angel. Allright?

848
00:45:00,751 --> 00:45:03,195
Fine. Start with this assumption.
It can not hurt.

849
00:45:03,196 --> 00:45:06,000
Agreed. So...
How are things going up there? What's up?

850
00:45:06,001 --> 00:45:08,550
Nothing special.
Business as usual.

851
00:45:08,551 --> 00:45:10,650
But tell me! I'd like to understand
how things happen over there.

852
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:12,800
You don't believe me, do you?

853
00:45:12,801 --> 00:45:13,801
Angela...

854
00:45:13,802 --> 00:45:20,000
Admit that a beautiful, 6 feet tall, blonde girl,
smoking like a factory, is not the usual picture of an angel.

855
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,150
And you don't even want to show me your wings.
How am I supposed to believe you?

856
00:45:22,151 --> 00:45:24,610
You're annoying...
I told you I can't unfold them.

857
00:45:24,611 --> 00:45:26,550
First, they're too large.
And second...

858
00:45:26,551 --> 00:45:29,750
I only unfold them when I'm leaving.
When my mission is complete.

859
00:45:29,751 --> 00:45:31,900
But you're so stupid
the mission is far from complete.

860
00:45:31,901 --> 00:45:34,850
You're so slow at figuring things out...
I'm not going home anytime soon.

861
00:45:35,475 --> 00:45:36,850
What mission?

862
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:38,800
I have come to help you.

863
00:45:38,801 --> 00:45:40,480
For now, you've only made things worse.

864
00:45:40,481 --> 00:45:42,850
You're the one making things worse!
Lying all the time, to everybody!

865
00:45:42,851 --> 00:45:44,350
Especially to yourself...

866
00:45:44,351 --> 00:45:47,990
Not even small lies here and there.
You're lying to yourself at a very deep level.

867
00:45:47,991 --> 00:45:50,320
And you're afraid.
Of yourself, of everything, all the time.

868
00:45:50,321 --> 00:45:52,060
You're airtight...
like an oyster who'd be afraid of the sea.

869
00:45:52,061 --> 00:45:53,061
An oyster?

870
00:45:53,062 --> 00:45:55,000
You came down from the sky
to tell me I'm like an oyster?

871
00:45:55,001 --> 00:45:58,300
Yes. I came to help you understand
what's going on in here.

872
00:45:58,301 --> 00:46:02,250
To help you figure out who you are.
So that you accept it.

873
00:46:02,251 --> 00:46:03,251
That's all?

874
00:46:03,252 --> 00:46:04,252
It's good enough.

875
00:46:04,253 --> 00:46:06,300
And how's that different from a psychoanalyst?

876
00:46:06,301 --> 00:46:07,301
I won't cost you 100 Euros.

877
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,700
Okay.
Let's say you're an angel.

878
00:46:13,701 --> 00:46:16,460
How does it go? You're on your cloud,
and they call you for an assignment?

879
00:46:16,461 --> 00:46:18,850
Quite simplitic,
but that's the idea, yes...

880
00:46:18,851 --> 00:46:22,650
And so they call ?
'Angela! Can you please handle case number 12,737 ?'

881
00:46:22,651 --> 00:46:25,930
No, you don't get to choose your mission.
It's imposed on you.

882
00:46:25,931 --> 00:46:27,450
Actually that's a good thing...

883
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:31,300
Because if each angel got to choose his assignment,
the planning department would never manage it.

884
00:46:31,301 --> 00:46:32,950
Ah yes... the planning department.

885
00:46:32,951 --> 00:46:35,000
Planning is important. Right...
And after that?

886
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:40,550
Well... after you got your mission, you go to the dressing room.
It's my favourite part.

887
00:46:40,551 --> 00:46:41,960
And what outfit did you choose?

888
00:46:41,961 --> 00:46:42,961
Bitch!

889
00:46:42,962 --> 00:46:44,415
Bitch fits you really well.

890
00:46:44,416 --> 00:46:45,651
Gee, thanks!

891
00:46:45,652 --> 00:46:51,120
I've already tried all the other styles.
I figured it'd be fun to try something more weird.

892
00:46:51,121 --> 00:46:52,121
You've been doing that job for long?

893
00:46:52,122 --> 00:46:54,280
300 years.
Approximately.

894
00:46:54,281 --> 00:46:56,000
I'm still young.

895
00:46:57,890 --> 00:46:58,890
Why are you laughing?

896
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:09,000
This story is so great!

897
00:47:09,001 --> 00:47:11,725
I never heard a girl
who had so much imagination.

898
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:17,400
You should write books,
or encyclopedias...

899
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:19,200
We would make so much money!

900
00:47:20,925 --> 00:47:22,850
You still don't believe me,
is that it?

901
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:25,450
No.

902
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,700
Hey, Angela...

903
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:47,570
There nothing worse for an angel,
than being rejected by its mate...

904
00:47:47,571 --> 00:47:50,500
and returning from a mission
without having completed it.

905
00:47:50,501 --> 00:47:53,050
Please, don't be like that...

906
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,550
Understand me... I'm a loser.
I'm in trouble...

907
00:47:56,551 --> 00:47:58,885
... and a bitch would be sent
from the sky to help me?

908
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:01,170
Yes.
What's the problem?

909
00:48:01,171 --> 00:48:04,430
The problem is that, here on Earth,
we have a hard time believing in what we can't see.

910
00:48:04,431 --> 00:48:07,600
I don't know when was your last visit,
but this world has become very materialistic.

911
00:48:07,601 --> 00:48:10,850
And... and... and...
there are satellites, science, tv...

912
00:48:10,851 --> 00:48:13,300
People don't really believe in miracles.

913
00:48:13,301 --> 00:48:16,000
The ney proof.
You understand?

914
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:19,850
Don't you have a small proof?

915
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:24,450
You men are all the same...
Always needing proof.

916
00:48:24,451 --> 00:48:25,500
Always needing to be reassured.

917
00:48:25,501 --> 00:48:29,000
That's what you keep blaming me for :
my lack of self-confidence.

918
00:48:29,001 --> 00:48:35,000
At least, show me that that I can trust you.
And maybe it'll help me trusting myself.

919
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,579
Don't tell anyone...

920
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:41,330
I don't want to be fired
because of you.

921
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:42,500
I swear.

922
00:48:42,501 --> 00:48:43,501
Shhh!

923
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,480
I... I promise.

924
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:09,500
Satisfied?

925
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:11,420
How...
How did you do that trick?

926
00:49:11,421 --> 00:49:13,100
Rha! Fuck!
You gotta be kidding!

927
00:49:13,101 --> 00:49:16,520
You asked for proof. I provided.
And you don't believe me!

928
00:49:16,845 --> 00:49:17,699
How did you do that trick?

929
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:19,101
You really are a tool...

930
00:49:19,102 --> 00:49:21,350
Opening your mind won't take a miracle,
but a jackhammer.

931
00:49:21,351 --> 00:49:22,351
How come?

932
00:49:23,725 --> 00:49:26,800
I... I haven't seen it clearly.
How you did the cigarette trick.

933
00:49:26,801 --> 00:49:29,720
I... I wasn't focused.
I wasn't looking. And...

934
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:34,050
Angela. I'm asking nicely...
Please, do it again.

935
00:49:34,051 --> 00:49:35,051
Please...

936
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,360
It's the last time I'm asking you.

937
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Okay.

938
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:03,350
Garcon!
Another coffee.

939
00:50:03,351 --> 00:50:05,625
And a vodka tonic for this man, please.

940
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:07,170
Thank you.

941
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:16,700
Why me?

942
00:50:16,701 --> 00:50:19,580
I don't know...
I'm not from the planning department.

943
00:50:22,370 --> 00:50:25,600
Probably because you're good, inside.
And you haven't realized it yet.

944
00:50:25,601 --> 00:50:27,600
I'm here to show it to you.

945
00:50:27,601 --> 00:50:29,740
I'm your reflection.

946
00:50:29,741 --> 00:50:31,041
Your image.

947
00:50:31,355 --> 00:50:32,855
I am you.

948
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:41,450
I'm a 6 feet tall bitch?

949
00:50:41,451 --> 00:50:44,090
Yeah. A little.
On the inside.

950
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:47,780
But I'm not a woman.

951
00:50:47,781 --> 00:50:52,000
Yes you are. A half...
Actually more feminine than masculine.

952
00:50:52,001 --> 00:50:55,500
That's where you get your sensibility from.
Your humor, your wit...

953
00:50:55,501 --> 00:50:57,400
...those are feminine traits.

954
00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:00,800
Men are hunters...

955
00:51:00,801 --> 00:51:03,250
But you...
You're not really built for hunting.

956
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,040
From the masculine side...
You've only kept the bad traits.

957
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:08,870
Lies.
Ambition.

958
00:51:08,871 --> 00:51:10,660
Fear of failure.

959
00:51:10,661 --> 00:51:11,661
Fear of judgement.

960
00:51:11,662 --> 00:51:12,662
Fear of loving.

961
00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:21,890
And you see all this in me?

962
00:51:21,891 --> 00:51:22,891
All of it.

963
00:51:23,795 --> 00:51:28,460
And let me tell you
that you're a real hottie inside.

964
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,300
It's the outside that troubles me...

965
00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:38,515
Okay.
Let's go outside, then...

966
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:11,680
Am I losing feathers?

967
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:13,400
Here. In the back.
Am I losing feathers?

968
00:52:13,401 --> 00:52:14,401
What?

969
00:52:14,402 --> 00:52:15,289
Feathers...

970
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:16,403
Uh?

971
00:52:16,404 --> 00:52:20,115
I have a calcium deficiency.
I need to eat.

972
00:52:21,845 --> 00:52:23,200
You need cheese, for calcium...

973
00:52:23,201 --> 00:52:26,400
Double cheese, double ham,
double salad, please.

974
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,200
Don't stare like that.
You look like you're going to eat me.

975
00:52:29,201 --> 00:52:32,000
Ah... sorry.
That's because...

976
00:52:32,001 --> 00:52:34,710
... I'm not used to have...

977
00:52:35,310 --> 00:52:36,300
... someone next to me.

978
00:52:36,301 --> 00:52:37,700
You'd better get used to it, then.

979
00:52:37,701 --> 00:52:38,701
I know.

980
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:42,880
But you know...
In my life, a lot of bad shit happened to me.

981
00:52:42,881 --> 00:52:45,150
And nobody ever helped me with it.

982
00:52:45,151 --> 00:52:46,151
Ever.

983
00:52:46,152 --> 00:52:48,090
You're screwed, now.

984
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:48,850
Why?

985
00:52:48,851 --> 00:52:51,930
Because you don't have an excuse
to stay in trouble anymore.

986
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,200
Thank you.

987
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:54,500
Do you have any mustard, please?

988
00:52:54,501 --> 00:52:56,300
On the counter.
It's free.

989
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:57,301
Thanks.

990
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:00,550
Can I take a napkin?

991
00:53:00,551 --> 00:53:01,401
Yep.

992
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:05,630
Hey! Mustard is free.
The sandwich is 8 Euros.

993
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,650
I've just put a 10 Euros bill on the table.

994
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:10,200
There.

995
00:53:10,895 --> 00:53:12,565
No 10 Euros bill.

996
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:14,460
Wait... Look on the ground.
It must have flown away...

997
00:53:14,461 --> 00:53:15,461
You never put the 10 Euros.

998
00:53:15,462 --> 00:53:19,290
Come on... don't pull that on me.
We need money too.

999
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:22,900
Keep that trick for the tourists.
I'm from Paris, and I know too well how you...

1000
00:53:22,901 --> 00:53:26,250
Pay! Or else, you not leaving
the park alive! Understand?

1001
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:27,251
Can I finish the neg' ?

1002
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:30,880
Here yo go.
It's much better like that.

1003
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:31,720
So, how much was it?

1004
00:53:31,721 --> 00:53:32,589
It's on me...

1005
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:33,952
Thank you.

1006
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:40,130
Is... is that clear?

1007
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:44,850
Hell!
Your masculine side is quite in-your-face.

1008
00:53:44,851 --> 00:53:45,851
Why did you act like that, Andre?

1009
00:53:45,852 --> 00:53:46,852
What did I do wrong?

1010
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:48,660
What is this?

1011
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:50,710
Where did you get it?

1012
00:53:50,711 --> 00:53:51,711
Why didn't you give him his 10 Euros?

1013
00:53:51,712 --> 00:53:52,712
Why did you care?

1014
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,110
Can't we talk about that a bit further?
Come...

1015
00:53:55,111 --> 00:53:57,450
Those 10 Euros weren't even yours.
I gave them.

1016
00:53:57,451 --> 00:53:59,350
Exactly : that's all we have left.
Let's go!

1017
00:53:59,351 --> 00:54:03,250
You spend your time finding ways not to communicate, Andre.
You're all over the place. Up to no good.

1018
00:54:03,251 --> 00:54:04,251
Sorry for interrupting...

1019
00:54:04,252 --> 00:54:05,050
You! Shut up! Okay?

1020
00:54:05,051 --> 00:54:08,050
And you... you remind me of those people
who take a second serving of bread to finish their cheese.

1021
00:54:08,051 --> 00:54:10,250
And then they take more cheese,
to finish the bread.

1022
00:54:10,251 --> 00:54:13,445
And if with the French, it's even more complicated.
They take more wine, to finish both.

1023
00:54:13,446 --> 00:54:16,150
Afterwards, they're suprised to still be
around lunch at three in the afternoon.

1024
00:54:16,151 --> 00:54:17,625
What kind of lame example was that?

1025
00:54:17,626 --> 00:54:19,850
I don't like cheese.
And I don't see your point anyway.

1026
00:54:19,851 --> 00:54:21,860
I'm in trouble.
And I'm trying to get out of it like I can.

1027
00:54:21,861 --> 00:54:23,690
But there no way for you to understand that.

1028
00:54:23,691 --> 00:54:25,960
You can jump from a bridge, fuck whoever,
smoke like a drunkard...

1029
00:54:25,961 --> 00:54:26,961
Nothing is a problem to you.

1030
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:29,740
Belittling my credit won't make yours any greater.

1031
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:32,700
You really are an annoyance, Angela.

1032
00:54:32,701 --> 00:54:34,780
Why do you always have
to intellectualize everything?

1033
00:54:34,781 --> 00:54:36,350
She keeps doing that.
It's irritating.

1034
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:39,325
I'm just trying to show you the mechanism
that causes you to always screw up.

1035
00:54:39,326 --> 00:54:41,560
She's got a point :
you're screwed.

1036
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,750
Listen, buddy.
You're going to let me handle this, okay?

1037
00:54:47,751 --> 00:54:48,751
I'll be right back.

1038
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:51,060
Damn, Angela...
Why are you doing this to me?

1039
00:54:51,061 --> 00:54:52,950
You said you're here to help me.
Why are you depressing me?

1040
00:54:52,951 --> 00:54:54,200
Ah? You were feeling better before?

1041
00:54:54,201 --> 00:54:57,300
Yeah! Yeah... Nothing exceptionnal,
but I sure was far less confused.

1042
00:54:57,301 --> 00:54:59,000
Why did you want to jump from a bridge, then?

1043
00:54:59,001 --> 00:55:00,001
Because...

1044
00:55:00,970 --> 00:55:02,825
See?
She's definitely messing with me.

1045
00:55:02,826 --> 00:55:05,225
What was the initial agreement?
Don't you remember our agreement?

1046
00:55:05,226 --> 00:55:07,355
You were supposed to shut up and follow me.
Remember?

1047
00:55:07,356 --> 00:55:08,500
Yes.
You're right

1048
00:55:08,501 --> 00:55:09,780
Well, here you go.

1049
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:11,850
Shut up, then.

1050
00:55:11,851 --> 00:55:13,480
Don't say anything, okay?

1051
00:55:13,481 --> 00:55:13,979
Okay.

1052
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:14,929
No!

1053
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:16,700
Don't even say 'okay'.

1054
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:19,250
You shut 100% up.
Okay?

1055
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,880
Do you understand '100%' ?

1056
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,000
Are you done?
Can we start doing serious business, now?

1057
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:29,000
Angela.
Can you play 'Simon says' ?

1058
00:55:29,001 --> 00:55:30,001
I love it!

1059
00:55:30,002 --> 00:55:31,650
Simon says :
Beat the shit out of these three assholes.

1060
00:55:31,651 --> 00:55:32,651
Okay!

1061
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:40,750
I'm glad I'm rid of them.

1062
00:55:40,751 --> 00:55:42,600
So?
What are we doing now?

1063
00:55:42,601 --> 00:55:43,601
Shhhh!

1064
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:45,600
We don't say anything.

1065
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:48,700
Now, we're going to go...

1066
00:55:50,745 --> 00:55:52,100
... going to go that way.

1067
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,480
Angela...
I'd like to know more about you, actually.

1068
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,130
Your past.
Back when you were on Earth.

1069
00:56:00,131 --> 00:56:00,860
Yeah?

1070
00:56:00,861 --> 00:56:02,132
Yes.

1071
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:05,270
Really. I want to know you better.
How were you, as a kid?

1072
00:56:08,215 --> 00:56:11,300
We were living in Paris.
In the 13rd district.

1073
00:56:11,301 --> 00:56:13,650
I'm the eldest of eight children.

1074
00:56:13,651 --> 00:56:15,480
I'm the one who took care of them.

1075
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:20,200
My mother ran away when I was 15.

1076
00:56:20,201 --> 00:56:22,500
And my father was drunk all day.

1077
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:25,350
I would take the little ones to school.

1078
00:56:25,351 --> 00:56:28,550
Then I would work as a prostitute,
so as to pay for their food.

1079
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:32,100
I died of an ovarian tumor when I was 23.

1080
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,500
Damn... poor thing.
It's horrible.

1081
00:56:37,290 --> 00:56:41,600
What kind of life was that ?
Whoa...

1082
00:56:42,025 --> 00:56:45,050
And I thought I was in trouble...
I should stop complaining.

1083
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:47,200
Why are you smiling?

1084
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:49,500
Because you're so gullible...
You believed that.

1085
00:56:49,501 --> 00:56:50,501
Ah?
That wasn't true?

1086
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:51,600
Nah...

1087
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:54,740
No.
I'm a rich girl from New Jersey.

1088
00:56:55,185 --> 00:56:56,600
Daddy used to work for the U.N.

1089
00:56:56,601 --> 00:56:58,400
And mummy was working
to bring people together...

1090
00:56:58,401 --> 00:57:01,800
... by being humped by all the males
she could find at cocktail parties.

1091
00:57:01,801 --> 00:57:04,300
On my 16th birthday,
I got my first Ferrari.

1092
00:57:04,301 --> 00:57:06,800
And I smashed it in the first fall I met.

1093
00:57:06,801 --> 00:57:08,450
Just so that my father would notice me...

1094
00:57:08,451 --> 00:57:10,000
... at least at my funeral.

1095
00:57:10,001 --> 00:57:12,000
I'm lost, now...
Which was your life?

1096
00:57:12,001 --> 00:57:14,450
Which one makes your own easier to endure?

1097
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:18,000
I don't know.

1098
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:22,400
I can make up a thousand of lives.
But yours will still be the same.

1099
00:57:22,401 --> 00:57:24,400
You'll have to accept it.

1100
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:28,430
I...
I see what you mean, Angela.

1101
00:57:28,431 --> 00:57:31,185
And...
I'm working on it.

1102
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,640
But still...
I want to know you.

1103
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:39,170
Who were you?
Before...

1104
00:57:50,575 --> 00:57:52,125
I don't know who I am.

1105
00:57:52,126 --> 00:57:54,000
How can't you know?

1106
00:57:54,001 --> 00:57:56,200
You come from the sky.
You're in the best position to know...

1107
00:57:56,201 --> 00:57:59,000
We can't access our past.
It's top secret data.

1108
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:00,250
Really?

1109
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:02,980
That gotta suck.

1110
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:07,480
Are my questions bothering you?

1111
00:58:07,481 --> 00:58:08,481
No.

1112
00:58:08,482 --> 00:58:11,800
You're interested in me.
That means you're getting interested in you.

1113
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,150
I'm not really interesting.

1114
00:58:13,151 --> 00:58:14,151
Of course you are!

1115
00:58:14,930 --> 00:58:16,220
You're good looking, smart...

1116
00:58:16,221 --> 00:58:17,430
Stop making fun of me.

1117
00:58:17,431 --> 00:58:19,000
You are!
I tell you!

1118
00:58:19,001 --> 00:58:21,950
It's all inside. But you don't see it.
You can't pull it out.

1119
00:58:21,951 --> 00:58:24,000
I'm trying.
I know...

1120
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:26,380
But it's not easy.

1121
00:58:26,381 --> 00:58:28,750
Yes it's easy!
Come, I'll show you!

1122
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:33,790
Look in the mirror!
What do you see?

1123
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:37,000
Look in the mirror...
What do you see?

1124
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:39,660
I see...

1125
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:42,020
A wonderful girl.

1126
00:58:42,021 --> 00:58:45,600
Thank you. And next to her?
What do you see?

1127
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
I don't know.

1128
00:58:49,001 --> 00:58:50,300
Good.
You're improving.

1129
00:58:50,301 --> 00:58:51,000
You think so?

1130
00:58:51,001 --> 00:58:52,850
Yes.
All you used to see was a pile of crap.

1131
00:58:52,851 --> 00:58:54,500
Now, you don't see anything anymore.

1132
00:58:54,501 --> 00:58:56,500
It means you've cleaned up the place.

1133
00:58:56,501 --> 00:59:00,230
Now, we need to
fill that empty shell with something.

1134
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:02,420
You can't leave it like that.

1135
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:05,120
So, take a good look.
In front of you...

1136
00:59:05,121 --> 00:59:09,450
Isn't there anything you like,
in this beautiful face?

1137
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:15,450
Not much, no...

1138
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:19,510
Look carefully. In your eyes.
What do you see?

1139
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:27,265
Some... some kindness?

1140
00:59:27,266 --> 00:59:30,885
Yes there is. A lot...
What else?

1141
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,230
They're not too bad?

1142
00:59:39,231 --> 00:59:41,600
Beauty. That's right.

1143
00:59:41,601 --> 00:59:42,945
They are beautiful.

1144
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:44,340
What else?

1145
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:51,000
Maybe...

1146
00:59:52,666 --> 00:59:53,800
Some sweetness?

1147
00:59:53,801 --> 00:59:56,560
Yes.
Lots of it.

1148
00:59:56,950 --> 00:59:58,650
And love?

1149
00:59:58,651 --> 00:59:59,651
Yeah.

1150
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:03,190
Lots of love, yes.

1151
01:00:04,110 --> 01:00:05,350
Too much, maybe.

1152
01:00:05,351 --> 01:00:07,250
If there's too much,
you need to get it out.

1153
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Tell me you love me.

1154
01:00:09,001 --> 01:00:09,950
Come again?

1155
01:00:09,965 --> 01:00:10,795
Don't you love me?

1156
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,003
I do.
A lot.

1157
01:00:12,004 --> 01:00:13,004
I mean...

1158
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,550
I feel a kind of affection...

1159
01:00:15,551 --> 01:00:16,875
But maybe it's friendship, and...

1160
01:00:16,876 --> 01:00:19,590
Do you love me, or not?

1161
01:00:24,215 --> 01:00:25,815
Since the first day.

1162
01:00:27,990 --> 01:00:29,490
Since the first second.

1163
01:00:29,491 --> 01:00:31,645
Good.
Say it, then.

1164
01:00:38,350 --> 01:00:40,700
It's...
It's hard to say.

1165
01:00:40,701 --> 01:00:41,701
Do you know why?

1166
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:42,702
No.

1167
01:00:42,703 --> 01:00:44,500
Because nobody ever told it to you.

1168
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:45,900
Right?

1169
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:51,350
It's difficult to love yourself,
when nobody shows you how.

1170
01:00:52,275 --> 01:00:53,275
Yes.

1171
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,440
I love you, Andre.

1172
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,615
Here you go.
You have received love.

1173
01:01:00,616 --> 01:01:02,615
Now you can give some away.

1174
01:01:02,616 --> 01:01:03,840
Go for it.

1175
01:01:09,810 --> 01:01:11,810
I love you, Angela.

1176
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:15,340
Whatever your fist name...

1177
01:01:15,870 --> 01:01:16,870
You're right.

1178
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:18,500
Say it again...

1179
01:01:18,501 --> 01:01:20,300
... without my name.

1180
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:25,500
I love you.

1181
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:27,880
Good.

1182
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:33,325
Now, look at yourself in the eye
and say it.

1183
01:01:45,930 --> 01:01:46,930
I can't.

1184
01:01:46,931 --> 01:01:47,931
Of course you can.

1185
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:52,520
Look at your body.
Bruised by the lack of love...

1186
01:01:52,521 --> 01:01:53,521
... of trust.

1187
01:01:54,850 --> 01:01:57,860
Don't you see it deserves your attention?

1188
01:01:57,861 --> 01:02:00,850
So, don't reject this wounded body.

1189
01:02:00,851 --> 01:02:03,650
It has put up with you for so long...

1190
01:02:03,651 --> 01:02:05,725
... and never complained.

1191
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:09,020
Tell him that he's important.

1192
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:11,860
That he belongs here.

1193
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:15,700
Give him what he deserves.

1194
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:39,992
I love you... Andre.

1195
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:43,580
I love you.

1196
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:48,000
I am proud of you, Andre.

1197
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:52,650
So? Can we get some food?
I'm hungry...

1198
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:55,080
You're obsessed with food, aren't you?

1199
01:02:55,081 --> 01:02:56,580
Do you have an emotional problem?

1200
01:02:56,581 --> 01:02:58,800
Hey, that's my line!

1201
01:02:59,350 --> 01:03:00,350
You're right.

1202
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:12,250
How are we going to pay the bill?

1203
01:03:12,251 --> 01:03:13,750
We'll wash the dishes...

1204
01:03:14,070 --> 01:03:14,751
It only worked in the Dark Ages.

1205
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:17,140
They're going to call the cops.
And we'll end up in jail.

1206
01:03:17,141 --> 01:03:18,980
I have a 6 months suspended sentence.
I know where I'm...

1207
01:03:18,981 --> 01:03:21,650
Stop complaining, now.
Just enjoy.

1208
01:03:21,651 --> 01:03:23,050
The wine is good, isn't it?

1209
01:03:23,051 --> 01:03:24,051
What kind is it?

1210
01:03:24,052 --> 01:03:25,052
Chateau Cheval Blanc.

1211
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:27,750
Cheval Blanc?

1212
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:29,510
It's 1,000 Euros!

1213
01:03:29,511 --> 01:03:31,840
1,500
It was the most expensive.

1214
01:03:31,841 --> 01:03:33,500
It sucks.
This place sucks.

1215
01:03:33,501 --> 01:03:35,100
Being the most expensive
doesn't mean it's the best, Angela.

1216
01:03:35,101 --> 01:03:37,050
How would you know?
You deal in olive oil.

1217
01:03:37,051 --> 01:03:39,200
Yes, but I know a thing or two.
I...

1218
01:03:39,201 --> 01:03:42,730
I'm sure the menu has some good little wines,
at very reasonable prices.

1219
01:03:42,731 --> 01:03:45,690
Look! Saint Chignon '98.
100 Euros. I'm sure it's good.

1220
01:03:45,691 --> 01:03:46,691
Sommelier!

1221
01:03:46,692 --> 01:03:47,675
Yes?

1222
01:03:47,676 --> 01:03:48,229
What are you doing?

1223
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:50,000
Well... we're going to taste.

1224
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:52,620
Can we have a Saint Chignon '98, please?

1225
01:03:52,621 --> 01:03:55,040
Oh, of course.
It's almost at maturity right now.

1226
01:03:55,041 --> 01:03:56,960
It's a bit peppery, a little round.

1227
01:03:56,970 --> 01:03:58,900
It's a very good wine.
A very good choice.

1228
01:03:58,901 --> 01:03:59,800
It's my favourite.

1229
01:03:59,801 --> 01:04:01,575
Can we simply have half a bottle?

1230
01:04:01,576 --> 01:04:03,945
No, we only have liters, here.

1231
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:07,540
You're crazy!
I swear... you're totally crazy.

1232
01:04:07,541 --> 01:04:09,780
You've had a hard day.
I'm trying to please you.

1233
01:04:09,781 --> 01:04:11,370
Is that your mission?
Pleasing me?

1234
01:04:11,371 --> 01:04:15,030
No. I'm supposed to teach you
the most things as quickly as possible.

1235
01:04:15,031 --> 01:04:16,870
So that you give up jumping from bridges.

1236
01:04:16,871 --> 01:04:19,570
If you intend to pay the bill
by doing dirty things in the restroom...

1237
01:04:19,571 --> 01:04:21,260
... I won't wait for you at the bar.
I'm warning you.

1238
01:04:21,261 --> 01:04:22,400
What dirty stuff?

1239
01:04:22,401 --> 01:04:24,850
Don't act innocent... I was there,
behind the door. I've seen everything.

1240
01:04:26,425 --> 01:04:28,500
Have you seen...
or heard?

1241
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:33,660
Angela?

1242
01:04:34,645 --> 01:04:35,645
What?

1243
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:37,250
What're you doing?

1244
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:39,750
Guess...

1245
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:42,800
I don't want...
I don't want you do do this for me.

1246
01:04:42,801 --> 01:04:44,000
I thought you needed money.

1247
01:04:44,001 --> 01:04:46,240
Yes, I need it.
But I still have some morality left.

1248
01:04:46,241 --> 01:04:49,000
I thank you for it...
I appreciate the gesture...

1249
01:04:49,001 --> 01:04:50,700
But no, really.
No way you're doing this at all.

1250
01:04:50,701 --> 01:04:52,725
Come on...
It's nothing.

1251
01:04:52,726 --> 01:04:53,726
Yes, it's something!

1252
01:04:53,727 --> 01:04:55,710
Listen. Stop right now.
Ask this man to go back home.

1253
01:04:55,711 --> 01:04:56,750
Come out, right now!

1254
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:59,050
Can't you give me a break,
so that I can finish? Fuck!

1255
01:05:03,445 --> 01:05:04,945
And what about Frank, then?

1256
01:05:04,946 --> 01:05:07,170
In his office...
What did you do?

1257
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:10,980
You didn't do that!

1258
01:05:11,050 --> 01:05:12,930
No...
Just kidding.

1259
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:14,980
What a relief...

1260
01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:18,050
But how did you get the money?

1261
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
You can't have done that!

1262
01:05:30,001 --> 01:05:32,425
Which option would you rather have?

1263
01:05:33,645 --> 01:05:34,645
I'd rather go away.

1264
01:05:44,810 --> 01:05:45,700
For a single night, is that it?

1265
01:05:45,701 --> 01:05:46,320
Yes.

1266
01:05:46,321 --> 01:05:47,321
Good.

1267
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:49,900
All done.

1268
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:52,000
Do you have...
any luggage?

1269
01:05:52,001 --> 01:05:54,150
Yes. One item.
Right in front.

1270
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:09,220
Feeling better?

1271
01:06:09,221 --> 01:06:10,700
Yeah, I'm fine...

1272
01:06:10,701 --> 01:06:11,990
Are you coming to bed?

1273
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:14,150
No, I'm looking at the city.

1274
01:06:14,151 --> 01:06:16,400
It'll still be there tomorrow.
Come to bed.

1275
01:06:16,401 --> 01:06:18,100
Paris is beautiful.

1276
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:21,150
I wasn't seeing anything.

1277
01:06:21,151 --> 01:06:23,780
I was blind like a bat.

1278
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:26,270
Angela...

1279
01:06:26,271 --> 01:06:27,271
What?

1280
01:06:28,430 --> 01:06:29,650
I think I love you.

1281
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:32,000
No you don't...
You're horny, that's all.

1282
01:06:32,001 --> 01:06:35,800
You're lacking affection.
So you're hanging on to the first one you run into.

1283
01:06:35,801 --> 01:06:37,000
i.e. : me!

1284
01:06:37,001 --> 01:06:39,800
No, no... Really.
You make me feel good.

1285
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:42,750
I love how you shake me up.

1286
01:06:42,751 --> 01:06:45,000
Without ever judging me.

1287
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:46,850
It makes me happy.

1288
01:06:48,620 --> 01:06:50,260
It's been a while since this happened to me.

1289
01:06:50,261 --> 01:06:51,750
It probably never did.

1290
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:53,750
You want to fuck, that's all.

1291
01:06:53,751 --> 01:06:55,630
No, I don't want to fuck...

1292
01:06:56,650 --> 01:06:58,650
Actually, I do,
but that's not it.

1293
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:00,900
It's stronger.
Warmer...

1294
01:07:00,901 --> 01:07:02,875
Oh la la!
You're waxing sentimental.

1295
01:07:02,876 --> 01:07:03,700
Come on, let's fuck!

1296
01:07:03,701 --> 01:07:05,625
No no no! Stop that!
What are you doing? Hey!

1297
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,000
Don't you like me?

1298
01:07:09,350 --> 01:07:11,500
Yes, yes... I do.
But I don't want to fuck.

1299
01:07:11,501 --> 01:07:15,940
I'd like to make love.
But I'll only do it once I feel...

1300
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:17,500
...free.

1301
01:07:18,050 --> 01:07:19,500
And what about me?

1302
01:07:21,350 --> 01:07:22,720
It won't take long.

1303
01:07:24,030 --> 01:07:26,430
Come on...
Come to bed.

1304
01:07:26,431 --> 01:07:27,431
I can't sleep.

1305
01:07:27,432 --> 01:07:29,500
And there's no point in brooding.

1306
01:07:29,501 --> 01:07:31,740
I'm not brooding.
I'm enjoying the room.

1307
01:07:32,430 --> 01:07:33,600
It's incredible.

1308
01:07:33,601 --> 01:07:35,475
By the way...
How are we going to pay for it?

1309
01:07:35,476 --> 01:07:37,850
I have an agreement with the head porter.

1310
01:07:37,851 --> 01:07:38,851
How so?

1311
01:07:38,852 --> 01:07:40,920
He bets on races.

1312
01:07:40,921 --> 01:07:42,640
So I gave him a tip.

1313
01:07:42,641 --> 01:07:43,641
A bad tip?

1314
01:07:43,642 --> 01:07:45,450
No, he's going to make 10,000 Euros.

1315
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,200
You know races results?

1316
01:07:47,201 --> 01:07:48,640
Any race.
Anywhere in the world.

1317
01:07:48,641 --> 01:07:51,160
Are you kidding me?
You let me bet on that rotten Brutus...

1318
01:07:51,161 --> 01:07:52,161
I had warned you.

1319
01:07:52,162 --> 01:07:54,785
But a few hours ago
you wouldn't listen to me.

1320
01:07:54,786 --> 01:07:58,500
And anyway... I'm not allowed to
give away that kind of information.

1321
01:07:58,501 --> 01:07:59,501
It's forbidden.

1322
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:02,000
You're not allowed to
give away that kind of information?

1323
01:08:02,001 --> 01:08:04,450
Why... Why did you tell me
that you're an angel, then?

1324
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:08,950
I shouldn't have.

1325
01:08:10,025 --> 01:08:11,350
Why did you do it, then?

1326
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:20,640
Hey!

1327
01:08:21,310 --> 01:08:22,325
What are you doing, Angela?

1328
01:08:22,326 --> 01:08:24,180
I'm off to see your buddy Frank.

1329
01:08:24,181 --> 01:08:26,125
What? In the middle of the night?
What are you going to tell him?

1330
01:08:26,126 --> 01:08:28,200
I'm not the one who has things to tell him.
You are!

1331
01:08:28,201 --> 01:08:31,275
So we're going to see him.
And you'll tell him everything you need.

1332
01:08:31,276 --> 01:08:33,260
So that I can go back home.

1333
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:34,900
Angela...

1334
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:39,150
Okay...
So, what should I tell him?

1335
01:08:39,940 --> 01:08:41,000
You're doing it again...

1336
01:08:41,001 --> 01:08:42,300
I told you a hundred times!

1337
01:08:42,301 --> 01:08:43,900
The truth!
Nothing but the truth.

1338
01:08:43,901 --> 01:08:45,500
The truth.
No problem. Okay.

1339
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:48,450
If you don't do that, your pain
will stay here, in a ball.

1340
01:08:48,451 --> 01:08:50,400
It's weaker, but it's still here, yeah...

1341
01:08:50,401 --> 01:08:53,110
You've got to get it out.
Once for all!

1342
01:08:53,111 --> 01:08:55,300
If it's outside,
it won't trouble you inside anymore.

1343
01:08:55,301 --> 01:08:56,920
Okay. No problem.
I agree.

1344
01:08:56,921 --> 01:08:57,921
And after that?

1345
01:08:57,922 --> 01:09:01,580
After that? You'll be cleared, on the inside.
You'll just have to fill up.

1346
01:09:02,410 --> 01:09:04,185
Angela...
What if it's with you that I want to fill up?

1347
01:09:04,186 --> 01:09:05,750
Ah...
Don't do that again.

1348
01:09:05,751 --> 01:09:08,050
Angela, I'm in love with you.

1349
01:09:08,051 --> 01:09:10,010
You see everything.
You feel everything...

1350
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:13,350
How can't you see
something this simple?

1351
01:09:14,310 --> 01:09:16,660
Focus, please.
Right here...

1352
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,580
What do you feel?

1353
01:09:22,050 --> 01:09:23,000
I feel something, but...

1354
01:09:23,001 --> 01:09:25,950
I feel exactly the same thing.

1355
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:28,600
And now I know how it's called.

1356
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:31,080
Anyway...

1357
01:09:31,081 --> 01:09:32,081
Let's go meet Frank...

1358
01:09:32,082 --> 01:09:35,100
Things are getting really messy.

1359
01:09:36,690 --> 01:09:39,900
No.
Things only start to looking clear now.

1360
01:09:40,490 --> 01:09:41,490
Like...

1361
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:43,650
Looking like the truth, for instance.

1362
01:09:45,945 --> 01:09:47,815
I'm tired, Angela... I swear.

1363
01:09:49,670 --> 01:09:51,810
I'm tired of screwing up all the time.

1364
01:09:51,811 --> 01:09:53,750
Tired of lies...

1365
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:59,690
For the first time in my life,
I want to be true.

1366
01:10:03,235 --> 01:10:05,400
I'll be able to say everything I feel.

1367
01:10:05,401 --> 01:10:06,401
Everything.

1368
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,160
Do you know what I'm feeling, Angela?

1369
01:10:11,650 --> 01:10:12,650
Shut up.

1370
01:10:19,850 --> 01:10:21,650
Miss!
Miss!

1371
01:10:21,651 --> 01:10:23,350
Miss, please...
Miss.

1372
01:10:24,950 --> 01:10:27,800
Now is really not the time to fuck with me.

1373
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:32,980
Sorry for interrupting you like that
in the middle of the night...

1374
01:10:32,981 --> 01:10:34,900
... but Andre has something
very important to tell you.

1375
01:10:34,901 --> 01:10:37,160
I can't take it anymore,
and I want to go home...

1376
01:10:37,161 --> 01:10:38,800
...so let's end this now!

1377
01:10:38,801 --> 01:10:39,600
Come again?

1378
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:40,320
Who's that girl?

1379
01:10:40,321 --> 01:10:42,100
You!
Shut the hell up!

1380
01:10:42,101 --> 01:10:43,200
Andre! Come in!

1381
01:10:43,201 --> 01:10:45,600
He's here.
In his bed...

1382
01:10:45,601 --> 01:10:47,210
What the fuck is this?

1383
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:52,620
When you start breaking the rules,
you really go for it...

1384
01:10:52,621 --> 01:10:54,615
The door...
The bodyguard...

1385
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:57,950
And you chose this place because you knew
that's where he would stay.

1386
01:10:57,951 --> 01:10:59,550
You're going to be fired.

1387
01:10:59,551 --> 01:11:01,550
That's not your business.
It's mine.

1388
01:11:01,551 --> 01:11:04,000
Be nice, now.
And deal with him quickly...

1389
01:11:04,001 --> 01:11:05,150
... so that we can get the hell away.

1390
01:11:06,820 --> 01:11:07,820
Okay.

1391
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:11,250
Andre...

1392
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:13,280
Andre...

1393
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,030
You're not going to kill me, aren't you?

1394
01:11:26,260 --> 01:11:28,300
Your coffee isn't bad, Frank.

1395
01:11:31,190 --> 01:11:34,700
Andre... I... I... I...
I'm sorry.

1396
01:11:34,701 --> 01:11:36,100
I... I know I offended you.

1397
01:11:36,101 --> 01:11:37,500
And it really was stupid of me, buddy.

1398
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:38,400
Buddy?

1399
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:39,900
No. Sorry about that.

1400
01:11:40,850 --> 01:11:43,500
I took advantage of your weakness, sir,
and really I shouldn't have.

1401
01:11:43,501 --> 01:11:45,100
That... that was pathetic of me.

1402
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:49,400
There's even some business we could do together.
If you want... That is, if you have the time

1403
01:11:49,401 --> 01:11:53,473
But I beg you... Andy.

1404
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:58,130
Do not kill me.
Be nice... do not kill me.

1405
01:11:59,050 --> 01:12:01,005
I'm sorry I borrowed money from you, Frank.

1406
01:12:01,006 --> 01:12:03,050
It's my fault.
I'm the one to blame.

1407
01:12:03,850 --> 01:12:05,930
In the first place, I should never have
set foot in your lousy club.

1408
01:12:05,931 --> 01:12:07,000
It cost me time and money...

1409
01:12:07,001 --> 01:12:09,550
Instead of taking care of the business
for which I came to Paris.

1410
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:11,600
But there's no escaping it.

1411
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,370
When you feel like shit, you're attracted by
the other pieces of shit like you. That's life.

1412
01:12:16,450 --> 01:12:18,700
That's why we used to get along fine,
in the beginning, Frank.

1413
01:12:18,701 --> 01:12:22,100
We could hate each other mutually.
That wasn't a problem.

1414
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:29,000
One day, an angel entered my life.

1415
01:12:30,450 --> 01:12:32,610
A wonderful woman, who opened my eyes.

1416
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:37,250
It's so good to have the eyes opened, Frank.

1417
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:42,000
Now I can look at the sun, rising over Paris.

1418
01:12:42,001 --> 01:12:45,250
All these small lightbulbs...
switching off, one by one.

1419
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:47,900
I can see all this, Frank.

1420
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:51,500
And it's thanks to her.

1421
01:12:52,550 --> 01:12:55,100
Because she had the kindness never to judge me.

1422
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:00,500
She loved me as I was.

1423
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:04,900
Even though I wasn't much.

1424
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:11,600
I am happy for you, Andre.
Sincerely.

1425
01:13:11,601 --> 01:13:14,401
But you're not going to kill me, aren't you?

1426
01:13:15,350 --> 01:13:16,350
No.

1427
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:19,300
I'm going to feel sorry for you.

1428
01:13:20,550 --> 01:13:23,000
Did you see that, Angela?
I did really good, for a first time!

1429
01:13:23,001 --> 01:13:24,001
Where are you?

1430
01:13:24,002 --> 01:13:25,002
Angela?

1431
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:29,500
Angela...

1432
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:24,250
Angela, what are you doing?
Where are you going?

1433
01:14:24,251 --> 01:14:25,050
I'm going home.

1434
01:14:25,051 --> 01:14:26,590
You can't do this to me.
It's impossible.

1435
01:14:26,591 --> 01:14:28,800
Angela, stop!
I did all you asked me to do.

1436
01:14:28,801 --> 01:14:30,540
Look!
I've emptied everything.

1437
01:14:30,541 --> 01:14:32,400
Now we can start over, together.

1438
01:14:32,401 --> 01:14:34,715
We'll be together, choosing the things
that will fullfill me. Like we said.

1439
01:14:34,716 --> 01:14:36,300
You're big enough to choose on your own, now.

1440
01:14:36,301 --> 01:14:37,650
I don't want to choose on my own!

1441
01:14:37,651 --> 01:14:39,380
I want to do this with you, Angela.

1442
01:14:39,381 --> 01:14:41,980
Because I love you. And I want to spend
the time I have left to live at your side.

1443
01:14:41,981 --> 01:14:44,535
If you leave me, it's going to be horrible.
I'll be falling back on my old habits.

1444
01:14:44,536 --> 01:14:46,090
As if I had gone this far for nothing.

1445
01:14:46,091 --> 01:14:48,540
Well... too bad.
Destroy yourself if you want.

1446
01:14:48,541 --> 01:14:50,250
I took many chances for you.

1447
01:14:50,251 --> 01:14:52,465
I've got a 9/10 chance of being fired.

1448
01:14:52,466 --> 01:14:54,700
So please be helpful, Andre.
Don't ruin it all.

1449
01:14:54,701 --> 01:14:56,250
And live the life you are meant to live.

1450
01:14:57,750 --> 01:14:59,735
Angela! What if the life I'm meant to live was
the one where I'm staying with you?

1451
01:14:59,736 --> 01:15:02,900
No! I already know your life entirely.

1452
01:15:02,901 --> 01:15:05,050
In two months, you will create your company.

1453
01:15:05,051 --> 01:15:08,700
In five years, it's going to be the leading olive oil business.

1454
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:12,000
You're going to meet Catherine.
A lovely 30 years old lawyer.

1455
01:15:12,001 --> 01:15:14,850
With whom you will have three beautiful children.

1456
01:15:14,851 --> 01:15:16,870
Do you want to know their names?

1457
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:20,550
Do you want to know how they'll do in school?

1458
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:24,570
I want to know why you're crying.

1459
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:27,465
Because...
Because it's always like that when a mission is completed.

1460
01:15:27,466 --> 01:15:29,580
I'm made for meeting.
Not for goodbyes.

1461
01:15:29,581 --> 01:15:31,660
Are you satisfied with this answer?

1462
01:15:32,975 --> 01:15:34,330
Listen to me.

1463
01:15:34,331 --> 01:15:36,190
What you've done for me was enormous.

1464
01:15:36,650 --> 01:15:37,600
You have my eternal appreciation.

1465
01:15:37,601 --> 01:15:40,550
'Eternal' ?
Please, don't use words you don't understand.

1466
01:15:40,551 --> 01:15:42,290
Angela, listen to me...
I'm sorry.

1467
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Forgive me.

1468
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:47,840
You've taught me what matters :
to stop lying.

1469
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:52,000
That's right.
That's the most important thing.

1470
01:15:52,001 --> 01:15:54,000
So why don't you stop lying yourself!

1471
01:15:56,450 --> 01:15:58,050
Angela, stop!
Listen to me.

1472
01:15:58,051 --> 01:15:59,715
Look at me.
Look at me in the eye.

1473
01:15:59,716 --> 01:16:00,235
Stop!

1474
01:16:00,236 --> 01:16:01,236
Look at me.

1475
01:16:02,550 --> 01:16:03,700
Leave me alone.

1476
01:16:03,701 --> 01:16:05,300
Let me tell you what I see in these eyes...

1477
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:09,270
I see a woman who doesn't want to leave.
A woman who's tired of not knowing who she is.

1478
01:16:10,580 --> 01:16:13,466
Like me, nobody ever told you he loved you.
And if someone did, you don't remember.

1479
01:16:13,467 --> 01:16:14,000
Shut up.

1480
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:15,001
I love you, Angela!

1481
01:16:15,390 --> 01:16:15,940
Shut up.

1482
01:16:15,941 --> 01:16:17,400
I love you.

1483
01:16:18,375 --> 01:16:19,000
Shut up!

1484
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:20,385
I can't live without you.
It's impossible!

1485
01:16:20,386 --> 01:16:22,650
What's the point of living with me?

1486
01:16:22,651 --> 01:16:24,150
What are you talking about?

1487
01:16:24,151 --> 01:16:26,120
I'd be an angel who burned her wings.

1488
01:16:26,121 --> 01:16:27,280
A fallen angel.

1489
01:16:27,281 --> 01:16:28,770
I don't care about that!

1490
01:16:28,771 --> 01:16:30,890
I love you the way you are.

1491
01:16:39,260 --> 01:16:40,500
I don't know...

1492
01:16:40,501 --> 01:16:42,250
...who I am!

1493
01:16:42,251 --> 01:16:44,100
I have no past.

1494
01:16:44,101 --> 01:16:45,400
Can you understand that?

1495
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:46,150
I know... I know...

1496
01:16:46,151 --> 01:16:50,100
How can...
How can, I achieve anything?

1497
01:16:50,121 --> 01:16:51,121
I know...

1498
01:16:51,122 --> 01:16:53,335
... if I don't know where I come from.

1499
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:58,260
I don't know where I come from.
I don't know where I come from...

1500
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:05,630
I know...
I know.

1501
01:17:10,510 --> 01:17:12,500
I know you don't have a past.

1502
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:16,560
But at least, let me give you a future.

1503
01:17:21,780 --> 01:17:23,500
What am I doing?

1504
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:25,200
My god...

1505
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:27,750
What am I doing?

1506
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:32,900
Can you leave god out of this decision, for once?

1507
01:17:46,450 --> 01:17:49,100
Angela... what's going on?
What's wrong, Angela?

1508
01:17:49,301 --> 01:17:51,000
What's happening to you?

1509
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:00,300
I have to go, Andre.

1510
01:18:00,301 --> 01:18:01,450
It's time.

1511
01:18:01,451 --> 01:18:04,100
Don't go! I'm begging you.
I love you.

1512
01:18:04,101 --> 01:18:06,300
I love you too, Andre.

1513
01:18:08,430 --> 01:18:09,530
I must go.

1514
01:18:09,531 --> 01:18:10,531
No!

1515
01:18:25,030 --> 01:18:26,030
Angela, I love you!

1516
01:21:32,780 --> 01:21:34,800
My name is Andre.
Andre Moussa.

1517
01:21:34,801 --> 01:21:37,700
I'm 28 years old.
And I am... free.
