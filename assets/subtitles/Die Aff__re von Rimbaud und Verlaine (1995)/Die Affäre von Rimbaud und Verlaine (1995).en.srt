1
00:03:10,347 --> 00:03:14,408
Sometimes he speaks
in a kind of tender dialect...

2
00:03:14,451 --> 00:03:17,682
of the death
which causes repentance...

3
00:03:17,721 --> 00:03:21,179
of the unhappy men
who certainly exist...

4
00:03:21,224 --> 00:03:25,251
of painful tasks
and heartrending departures.

5
00:03:26,863 --> 00:03:28,694
In the hovels
where we got drunk...

6
00:03:28,732 --> 00:03:32,190
he wept looking at those
who surrounded us...

7
00:03:32,235 --> 00:03:35,033
a cattle of poverty.

8
00:03:35,071 --> 00:03:38,404
He lifted up drunks
in the black streets.

9
00:03:38,441 --> 00:03:41,672
He had the pity a bad mother
has for small children.

10
00:03:41,711 --> 00:03:45,875
He moved with the grace
of a little girl at catechism.

11
00:03:45,915 --> 00:03:48,475
He pretended to know
about everything...

12
00:03:48,518 --> 00:03:52,511
business, art, medicine.

13
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,117
I followed him.

14
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,990
I had to.

15
00:04:11,207 --> 00:04:14,665
Someone for you, sir.
Over there.

16
00:04:14,711 --> 00:04:16,178
Do I know her?

17
00:04:18,715 --> 00:04:20,706
She gave me her card.

18
00:04:42,238 --> 00:04:44,706
Please...

19
00:04:44,741 --> 00:04:46,231
Please sit down.

20
00:04:48,244 --> 00:04:50,712
Has Andre
been looking after you?

21
00:04:50,747 --> 00:04:54,205
Can I get you
something to drink?

22
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,740
No, thank you.

23
00:04:57,253 --> 00:04:58,743
Please.

24
00:05:04,194 --> 00:05:06,162
It's really
a business matter...

25
00:05:06,196 --> 00:05:08,858
I want to discuss
with you, Mr. Verlaine.

26
00:05:13,703 --> 00:05:16,672
This was published
a few months ago...

27
00:05:16,706 --> 00:05:22,110
an unauthorized selection
of my brother's poems.

28
00:05:22,145 --> 00:05:24,170
My mother and I
are anxious to prevent...

29
00:05:24,214 --> 00:05:26,739
anything like this
from happening again.

30
00:05:26,783 --> 00:05:29,013
We thought you might
be able to help us.

31
00:05:29,052 --> 00:05:31,213
I? How?

32
00:05:31,254 --> 00:05:33,688
I understand you have
a large number...

33
00:05:33,723 --> 00:05:35,953
of my brother's manuscripts.

34
00:05:35,992 --> 00:05:37,687
I have some, yes.

35
00:05:37,727 --> 00:05:40,924
My mother and I
would be very grateful...

36
00:05:40,964 --> 00:05:42,955
if you would return them.

37
00:05:44,968 --> 00:05:48,062
I've always tried to use
the utmost discretion...

38
00:05:48,104 --> 00:05:49,901
in everything
concerning your brother.

39
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:54,103
I think I can say I've always
defended his interests.

40
00:05:54,143 --> 00:05:56,373
Sometimes I wonder why,
since in many ways...

41
00:05:56,412 --> 00:05:58,380
they're diametrically
opposed to my own.

42
00:05:58,414 --> 00:06:00,041
I don't see how.

43
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:04,144
It took many years for his work
to be understood...

44
00:06:04,187 --> 00:06:06,655
but once his name
began to be known...

45
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:10,147
it soon became clear
that our ways were numbered.

46
00:06:10,193 --> 00:06:14,391
The music of old-fashioned verse
was no longer enough.

47
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,398
He swept us away.

48
00:06:16,432 --> 00:06:19,333
Not that I mind, you understand.

49
00:06:19,369 --> 00:06:22,202
I know I was once a good writer.

50
00:06:23,673 --> 00:06:27,507
I didn't know his name
was so well-known.

51
00:06:27,544 --> 00:06:31,674
Yes.
The young understand him now.

52
00:06:31,714 --> 00:06:34,205
He's the voice of the future.

53
00:06:39,222 --> 00:06:40,689
What matters to me most...

54
00:06:40,723 --> 00:06:43,214
is that we did
our best work together.

55
00:06:45,228 --> 00:06:47,219
Both of us.

56
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,667
Morning!

57
00:08:07,176 --> 00:08:10,145
I'm looking for Paul Verlaine.

58
00:08:10,179 --> 00:08:12,147
Are you Monsieur Rimbaud?

59
00:08:12,181 --> 00:08:13,648
Yes.

60
00:08:13,683 --> 00:08:16,151
Monsieur Verlaine
is not with you, then?

61
00:08:16,185 --> 00:08:17,584
No.

62
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,747
He went to the station
to meet you.

63
00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:22,189
He doesn't know what
I look like, does he?

64
00:08:22,225 --> 00:08:24,659
I am
Mrs. Maute de Fleurville...

65
00:08:24,694 --> 00:08:26,753
Monsieur Verlaine's
mother-in-law,

66
00:08:26,796 --> 00:08:29,697
and this is my daughter...
Mrs. Verlaine.

67
00:08:40,843 --> 00:08:43,437
How did you get
from the station?

68
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:44,946
Walked.

69
00:08:44,981 --> 00:08:47,279
Perhaps you'd like a wash.

70
00:08:52,055 --> 00:08:53,716
No.

71
00:08:53,756 --> 00:08:55,451
You're even younger
than we imagined.

72
00:08:55,491 --> 00:08:57,959
How old are you?

73
00:08:57,994 --> 00:09:01,452
Darling, it's not polite
to ask people their ages.

74
00:09:01,497 --> 00:09:03,055
I need a piss.

75
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:10,139
How old are you,
if you don't mind?

76
00:09:10,173 --> 00:09:12,141
He does.

77
00:09:12,175 --> 00:09:14,803
Sixteen.

78
00:09:14,844 --> 00:09:18,075
You did say in your letter
you were twenty-one.

79
00:09:18,114 --> 00:09:20,810
I noticed you at the station...

80
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,148
but I didn't think
it could be you.

81
00:09:23,186 --> 00:09:24,483
Likewise.

82
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,488
Those poems you sent me...

83
00:09:26,522 --> 00:09:31,550
were remarkable
for someone of twenty-one.

84
00:09:31,594 --> 00:09:34,256
For someone of sixteen,
they're unprecedented.

85
00:09:34,297 --> 00:09:36,663
That's why I told you
I was twenty-one.

86
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:39,167
I didn't want you
to feel patronizing...

87
00:09:39,202 --> 00:09:41,193
before you'd read them.

88
00:09:42,939 --> 00:09:47,000
Of course. I hope your mother
isn't too angry with me.

89
00:09:47,043 --> 00:09:49,102
Once she'd found out
you'd sent the fare...

90
00:09:49,145 --> 00:09:50,612
she seemed quite happy.

91
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:06,424
You come from the Ardennes,
don't you, Monsieur Rimbaud?

92
00:10:06,462 --> 00:10:08,657
Yes.

93
00:10:08,698 --> 00:10:11,098
Pleasant town,
Charleville, isn't it?

94
00:10:11,134 --> 00:10:12,897
Last place on God's earth.

95
00:10:12,935 --> 00:10:15,904
What does your father do?

96
00:10:15,938 --> 00:10:17,872
Drinks mostly, I believe.

97
00:10:17,907 --> 00:10:19,431
We haven't seen him
for ten years.

98
00:10:19,475 --> 00:10:21,102
I'm sorry.

99
00:10:21,144 --> 00:10:23,738
No need.
He's very well out of it.

100
00:10:27,383 --> 00:10:30,284
Perhaps you'd like to read
something to us after dinner.

101
00:10:30,319 --> 00:10:32,549
No. I don't think so.

102
00:10:32,588 --> 00:10:34,783
- Why not?
- Don't want to.

103
00:10:34,824 --> 00:10:36,655
I never read out my poetry.

104
00:10:36,692 --> 00:10:38,785
All the other poets do.

105
00:10:38,828 --> 00:10:41,092
I'm not interested
in what they do.

106
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:43,121
We have soirees.

107
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,833
And you think poets
can learn from one another?

108
00:10:50,606 --> 00:10:52,471
Only if they're bad poets.

109
00:11:01,717 --> 00:11:03,685
You know about this?

110
00:11:03,719 --> 00:11:05,710
I know what it is.

111
00:11:07,723 --> 00:11:09,657
It's the poet's third eye.

112
00:11:11,093 --> 00:11:12,890
Melts glasses.

113
00:11:21,704 --> 00:11:24,332
What do you think of my wife?

114
00:11:24,373 --> 00:11:26,671
I don't know.

115
00:11:27,677 --> 00:11:29,201
What do you think of her?

116
00:11:29,245 --> 00:11:32,840
She's still only a child,
of course.

117
00:11:32,882 --> 00:11:34,406
So am I.

118
00:11:41,257 --> 00:11:43,088
Absinthe, two.

119
00:11:45,862 --> 00:11:48,194
You should do something
about getting it published.

120
00:11:48,231 --> 00:11:50,256
Why?

121
00:11:50,299 --> 00:11:52,733
Because that's what writers do.

122
00:11:52,768 --> 00:11:54,963
I couldn't care less
about being published.

123
00:11:55,004 --> 00:11:57,905
The only thing that matters
is the writing itself.

124
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,670
Everything else is literature.

125
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:03,178
Your last book
wasn't good enough.

126
00:12:03,212 --> 00:12:05,180
You don't think so?

127
00:12:05,214 --> 00:12:07,182
Premarital garbage.

128
00:12:07,216 --> 00:12:09,411
No. Love poems.

129
00:12:09,452 --> 00:12:12,182
A lot of people
found them very beautiful.

130
00:12:12,221 --> 00:12:14,485
But they're all lies.

131
00:12:14,523 --> 00:12:16,991
They're not lies. I love her.

132
00:12:17,026 --> 00:12:19,426
- Love?
- Yes.

133
00:12:19,462 --> 00:12:22,693
- No such thing.
- What do you mean?

134
00:12:22,732 --> 00:12:26,361
Whatever binds families
and married couples together...

135
00:12:26,402 --> 00:12:28,199
that's not love.

136
00:12:28,237 --> 00:12:30,705
That's stupidity
or selfishness or fear.

137
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,208
Love doesn't exist.

138
00:12:33,242 --> 00:12:34,971
You're wrong.

139
00:12:36,746 --> 00:12:38,714
Self-interest exists.

140
00:12:38,748 --> 00:12:41,717
Attachment based on
personal gain exists.

141
00:12:41,751 --> 00:12:44,219
Complacency exists.

142
00:12:44,253 --> 00:12:45,743
But not love.

143
00:12:49,492 --> 00:12:51,824
Love has to be reinvented.

144
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:58,228
Why did he want so much
to escape from reality?

145
00:12:58,267 --> 00:13:01,168
There never was a man
with such an aim.

146
00:13:01,203 --> 00:13:04,604
Did he perhaps know secrets
to change life?

147
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,506
"Sometimes I've seen...

148
00:13:08,544 --> 00:13:11,206
"what people
think they've seen."

149
00:13:16,218 --> 00:13:18,709
He's not how I imagined him.

150
00:13:22,725 --> 00:13:25,694
"I've wept too many tears...

151
00:13:25,728 --> 00:13:28,219
"heartbreaking dawns."

152
00:13:32,068 --> 00:13:35,196
I prefer your poems.

153
00:13:35,237 --> 00:13:38,229
I don't really understand
that kind of thing.

154
00:13:40,242 --> 00:13:41,732
No.

155
00:13:44,246 --> 00:13:46,407
No. This is something new.

156
00:13:50,753 --> 00:13:54,211
"I've wept too many tears...

157
00:13:54,256 --> 00:13:57,953
"heartbreaking dawns."

158
00:14:58,254 --> 00:14:59,846
What is it?

159
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:01,356
He's kicking.

160
00:15:15,371 --> 00:15:16,861
You see?

161
00:15:20,443 --> 00:15:22,172
There.

162
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,425
Don't you think
it would be more sensible...

163
00:15:39,462 --> 00:15:42,761
to get one of
your friends to put him up?

164
00:15:51,907 --> 00:15:54,967
People don't understand him.

165
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:57,205
I'm the only one
who understands him.

166
00:15:57,246 --> 00:16:00,682
Well, Daddy certainly
won't understand him.

167
00:16:05,654 --> 00:16:08,919
We had a revolution this year
which I supported.

168
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,926
I could have been shot.

169
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,689
If I hadn't been
thrown out of my job...

170
00:16:12,728 --> 00:16:16,494
you think I would have accepted
your father's damn charity?

171
00:16:36,051 --> 00:16:40,044
For God's sake, all I'm doing
is helping a friend!

172
00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:44,685
Why must we go through all this?
I'm your husband!

173
00:16:44,727 --> 00:16:46,217
I'm sorry, Paul.

174
00:16:48,964 --> 00:16:50,864
Are you trying to annoy me?

175
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,197
No.

176
00:16:52,234 --> 00:16:53,724
Well, don't.

177
00:17:36,011 --> 00:17:38,673
Evening!
Everyone's in bed, I'm afraid...

178
00:17:38,714 --> 00:17:41,683
unless you've come
to see the old boy.

179
00:17:41,717 --> 00:17:43,412
The old boy?

180
00:17:43,452 --> 00:17:45,886
Maute de Fleurville.
A friend of his?

181
00:17:45,921 --> 00:17:47,718
No.

182
00:17:47,756 --> 00:17:51,658
You wouldn't like to buy
a crucifix, would you?

183
00:17:51,694 --> 00:17:56,188
I can let you have this one
on extremely reasonable terms.

184
00:17:56,232 --> 00:17:58,700
It's made with real pearls,
I think.

185
00:17:58,734 --> 00:18:00,634
Who the hell are you?

186
00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:03,137
I might ask you
the same question...

187
00:18:03,172 --> 00:18:05,140
except I'd be more polite.

188
00:18:05,174 --> 00:18:07,165
I am Maute de Fleurville.

189
00:18:16,085 --> 00:18:17,643
Then this is your dog
I just broke.

190
00:18:17,686 --> 00:18:19,017
What?

191
00:18:20,689 --> 00:18:22,657
Why?

192
00:18:22,691 --> 00:18:24,181
Dogs are all liberals.

193
00:18:36,438 --> 00:18:38,167
Since when
have you had the right...

194
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:41,973
to invite people into this house
without my permission?

195
00:18:44,213 --> 00:18:47,182
If I can't put up a guest
in my own home...

196
00:18:47,216 --> 00:18:50,708
I might as well
live somewhere else.

197
00:18:50,753 --> 00:18:53,551
If you weren't so idle,
you could afford to.

198
00:18:53,589 --> 00:18:56,820
- You know very well...
- Any excuse.

199
00:18:56,859 --> 00:19:00,158
I don't notice you working
your fingers to the bone.

200
00:19:00,195 --> 00:19:02,459
When you next see
that hooligan...

201
00:19:02,498 --> 00:19:06,628
kindly ask him to return
the objects he's pilfered.

202
00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:09,502
- What are you talking about?
- He'll know.

203
00:19:09,538 --> 00:19:12,974
Ask him yourself.

204
00:19:13,008 --> 00:19:15,909
I'm happy to say,
he's left the house.

205
00:19:15,944 --> 00:19:17,172
What?

206
00:19:49,745 --> 00:19:50,939
Thank God.

207
00:19:50,979 --> 00:19:53,277
I thought I would
never find you.

208
00:19:53,315 --> 00:19:57,183
I don't know what that bastard
thought he was doing.

209
00:19:57,219 --> 00:19:58,686
It's his house.

210
00:19:58,721 --> 00:20:00,188
Yes. Come on.

211
00:20:00,222 --> 00:20:02,213
We'll find you somewhere.

212
00:20:33,122 --> 00:20:34,453
It's not much, I'm afraid.

213
00:20:49,938 --> 00:20:51,735
Just for a few days.

214
00:20:51,774 --> 00:20:54,004
It's fine.

215
00:20:59,381 --> 00:21:01,281
So do you love her?

216
00:21:01,316 --> 00:21:05,184
Of course. She's ideal.

217
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,246
Eighteen, beautiful,
plenty of money...

218
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:11,316
all the wifely virtues,
and she's giving me a baby.

219
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,694
- Do you have anything in common?
- No.

220
00:21:15,731 --> 00:21:18,757
- Is she intelligent?
- No.

221
00:21:18,801 --> 00:21:20,564
Does she understand you?

222
00:21:22,738 --> 00:21:24,296
No.

223
00:21:24,339 --> 00:21:28,935
Then the only thing
she can give you is sex.

224
00:21:57,272 --> 00:21:58,864
Hi!

225
00:21:58,907 --> 00:22:01,034
Hey!

226
00:22:10,719 --> 00:22:12,687
Did you find him?

227
00:22:12,721 --> 00:22:14,211
I did.

228
00:22:18,727 --> 00:22:21,753
And did he give you back
Daddy's crucifix?

229
00:22:23,499 --> 00:22:26,900
If your father's capable
of throwing that boy out...

230
00:22:26,935 --> 00:22:31,167
he's got no right having Christ
hanging all over his walls.

231
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:42,542
You people don't understand
what poverty is.

232
00:22:42,584 --> 00:22:44,711
In Charleville,
if he wanted a book...

233
00:22:44,753 --> 00:22:46,721
he had to steal it.

234
00:22:46,755 --> 00:22:49,747
That proves
what kind of person he is.

235
00:22:59,868 --> 00:23:01,927
I'm sorry.

236
00:23:04,873 --> 00:23:07,171
You shouldn't have said that.

237
00:23:07,209 --> 00:23:08,972
I'm sorry.

238
00:23:09,011 --> 00:23:11,275
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

239
00:23:14,917 --> 00:23:17,181
Are you all right, my dear?

240
00:23:17,219 --> 00:23:19,210
Yes, I'm all right.

241
00:23:41,577 --> 00:23:45,206
It was last summer
during the war...

242
00:23:45,247 --> 00:23:49,206
one of the many times
I ran away from home.

243
00:23:49,251 --> 00:23:53,711
I came down to the river
to fill my water bottle...

244
00:23:53,755 --> 00:23:57,589
and there was a Prussian soldier
not much older than me...

245
00:23:57,626 --> 00:23:59,753
asleep in the clearing.

246
00:24:03,632 --> 00:24:06,863
I watched him for a long time
before I realized...

247
00:24:08,437 --> 00:24:10,166
he wasn't asleep.

248
00:24:10,205 --> 00:24:11,695
He was dead.

249
00:24:15,711 --> 00:24:18,703
And somehow that
clarified things for me.

250
00:24:22,217 --> 00:24:24,685
I understood
that what I needed...

251
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,689
to become the first poet
of this century...

252
00:24:27,723 --> 00:24:30,715
was to experience
everything in my body.

253
00:24:33,462 --> 00:24:36,727
It was no longer enough
for me to be one person.

254
00:24:40,235 --> 00:24:42,226
I decided to be everyone.

255
00:24:45,741 --> 00:24:48,232
I decided to be a genius.

256
00:24:51,747 --> 00:24:54,238
I decided
to originate the future.

257
00:25:17,706 --> 00:25:19,196
Thank you.

258
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:31,250
The principle
is very like photography...

259
00:25:31,286 --> 00:25:33,686
only instead of
photographing a man's face...

260
00:25:33,722 --> 00:25:35,690
you photograph his voice.

261
00:25:35,724 --> 00:25:37,692
Then twenty years later...

262
00:25:37,726 --> 00:25:40,695
just as you'd open
a photograph album...

263
00:25:40,729 --> 00:25:44,688
you put the relevant cylinder
into the paleophone...

264
00:25:44,733 --> 00:25:49,864
and you listen to
a poet reading his poems...

265
00:25:49,905 --> 00:25:51,805
or singing his songs.

266
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,866
And you think
you could invent...

267
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:57,879
a machine like that
which worked?

268
00:25:57,913 --> 00:25:59,710
For Christ's sake,
let's get the fuck out of here.

269
00:25:59,748 --> 00:26:01,909
- We can't.
- Why not?

270
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:05,386
- He's about to read.
- Which one?

271
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:08,184
Aicard. Over there.

272
00:26:08,223 --> 00:26:10,714
I don't think
I'll like him very much.

273
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:13,227
Verlaine showed me
some of your poems.

274
00:26:13,261 --> 00:26:14,728
Yes?

275
00:26:14,763 --> 00:26:16,196
Remarkable. Very promising.

276
00:26:16,231 --> 00:26:20,861
Only, it seems all
that ingenuity is marred by...

277
00:26:20,902 --> 00:26:22,335
Well, not exactly
a juvenile urge to shock...

278
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:24,338
but something of the sort.

279
00:26:24,372 --> 00:26:27,341
- And were you shocked?
- No, I wasn't.

280
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:30,344
Then why would you suppose
I intended you to be?

281
00:26:30,378 --> 00:26:32,346
That's not really the point.

282
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,847
Seems fair enough to me.

283
00:26:33,882 --> 00:26:36,407
I could object
to your technical approach.

284
00:26:36,451 --> 00:26:38,919
I could object to your tie.

285
00:26:38,954 --> 00:26:40,922
He doesn't like
discussing his poetry.

286
00:26:40,956 --> 00:26:42,446
I see.

287
00:26:44,126 --> 00:26:46,617
A surprise for our friend.

288
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,098
Thank you.

289
00:26:55,137 --> 00:26:57,105
Thank you, gentlemen.

290
00:26:57,139 --> 00:27:00,768
Sulfuric acid.

291
00:27:00,809 --> 00:27:03,539
I would ask you
to bear this in mind...

292
00:27:03,578 --> 00:27:06,706
although, as with all
worthwhile work for children...

293
00:27:06,748 --> 00:27:10,878
it's hoped what is said
is of relevance to adults.

294
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:13,888
The poem is called
"Green Absinthe."

295
00:27:13,922 --> 00:27:18,723
Green absinthe is the potion
of the damned...

296
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,228
a deadly poison
silting up the veins...

297
00:27:21,263 --> 00:27:24,232
while wife and child
sit weeping in their slum...

298
00:27:24,266 --> 00:27:25,733
I don't believe it.

299
00:27:25,767 --> 00:27:27,735
...pours absinthe
into his brains.

300
00:27:27,769 --> 00:27:29,236
Shit.

301
00:27:29,271 --> 00:27:31,239
O drunkard,
most contemptible of men...

302
00:27:31,273 --> 00:27:34,800
- Shit!
- Be quiet.

303
00:27:34,843 --> 00:27:37,073
It's authentic shit!

304
00:27:37,112 --> 00:27:38,511
Please!

305
00:27:38,547 --> 00:27:41,072
...degraded, fallen,
sinful, and obtuse...

306
00:27:41,116 --> 00:27:42,947
I like it!

307
00:27:42,984 --> 00:27:45,077
...to beat
your wife and child...

308
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,588
For trying to deprive you
of the juice!

309
00:27:47,622 --> 00:27:49,988
- Get out!
- Me?

310
00:27:50,025 --> 00:27:52,858
Yes, you offensive
little bastard. Get out.

311
00:27:52,894 --> 00:27:55,829
I think I may be permitted
to raise some objection...

312
00:27:55,864 --> 00:27:57,832
against the butchering
of French poetry.

313
00:27:57,866 --> 00:28:00,426
No, you may not.
Apologize and get out!

314
00:28:00,468 --> 00:28:02,459
Don't come near.

315
00:28:02,504 --> 00:28:04,199
Be careful!

316
00:28:04,239 --> 00:28:07,265
You think you can frighten me
with that thing.

317
00:28:07,309 --> 00:28:09,470
Careful! Careful, I say!

318
00:28:13,048 --> 00:28:14,538
Get out!

319
00:28:14,583 --> 00:28:16,073
Come on.

320
00:28:21,323 --> 00:28:24,019
Now you, you fucking...

321
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:26,050
Come here!

322
00:28:26,094 --> 00:28:29,291
Come here!

323
00:28:29,331 --> 00:28:32,061
In the days of Francois I...

324
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,228
wise and benevolent giants
roamed the countryside...

325
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:37,568
and one of
their primary functions...

326
00:28:37,606 --> 00:28:40,507
was to rid the world
of pedants...

327
00:28:40,542 --> 00:28:45,673
fools... and writers
of no talent...

328
00:28:45,714 --> 00:28:47,545
by pissing on them
from a great height.

329
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:13,774
How to make your way
in the literary world.

330
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,548
The depressing thing
about this city...

331
00:29:21,583 --> 00:29:23,710
is that the artists
are even more bourgeois...

332
00:29:23,752 --> 00:29:25,982
than the fucking bourgeoisie.

333
00:30:09,264 --> 00:30:10,993
We should make a bargain.

334
00:30:12,701 --> 00:30:16,728
You help me, and I'll help you.

335
00:30:16,771 --> 00:30:18,204
If we go away together...

336
00:30:18,239 --> 00:30:21,367
I'm sure you'll be able
to do good work again.

337
00:30:21,409 --> 00:30:26,540
And when we've taken as much
as we can from each other...

338
00:30:26,581 --> 00:30:29,607
we simply split up and move on.

339
00:30:29,651 --> 00:30:33,314
And how would we live?

340
00:30:33,355 --> 00:30:35,880
You have some money,
don't you?

341
00:30:40,929 --> 00:30:42,897
I understand.

342
00:30:42,931 --> 00:30:45,798
I help you by supporting you...

343
00:30:45,834 --> 00:30:49,702
and you help me by renewing
my rusty old inspiration.

344
00:30:49,738 --> 00:30:51,797
Is that it?

345
00:31:06,688 --> 00:31:08,656
Not altogether.

346
00:31:41,089 --> 00:31:43,683
Where have you been?

347
00:31:43,725 --> 00:31:48,128
I thought I'd probably
just get in the way.

348
00:31:48,163 --> 00:31:50,131
Don't shout.

349
00:31:50,165 --> 00:31:52,292
You'll wake the baby.

350
00:32:02,343 --> 00:32:04,106
Is it a boy?

351
00:32:04,145 --> 00:32:06,079
Yes.

352
00:32:15,023 --> 00:32:17,218
Funny-looking little bugger.

353
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:23,592
Don't.

354
00:32:23,631 --> 00:32:26,122
All right.

355
00:32:26,167 --> 00:32:28,362
All right.

356
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:50,751
Thank you.

357
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:57,498
Thank you.

358
00:33:07,942 --> 00:33:09,739
Please.

359
00:33:12,113 --> 00:33:14,809
Why not?

360
00:33:17,018 --> 00:33:19,452
The baby was born.

361
00:34:04,265 --> 00:34:07,564
- Isabelle!
- I didn't know you were coming.

362
00:34:07,602 --> 00:34:10,070
Where is the mouth of darkness?

363
00:34:10,104 --> 00:34:13,073
Mother? She's in
the fields with Vitalie.

364
00:34:13,107 --> 00:34:16,008
- Do you want to see her?
- No.

365
00:34:43,238 --> 00:34:44,728
Thanks.

366
00:34:51,813 --> 00:34:53,713
Are you back for good?

367
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:57,618
For good I don't know.

368
00:34:57,652 --> 00:34:59,483
For better or worse.

369
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:04,219
There's work to be done
in the fields.

370
00:35:04,259 --> 00:35:05,692
There's work to be done here.

371
00:35:05,727 --> 00:35:09,254
I thought you were
getting on well in Paris.

372
00:35:09,297 --> 00:35:11,822
Verlaine's wife
started to make trouble.

373
00:35:11,866 --> 00:35:13,800
What kind of trouble?

374
00:35:13,835 --> 00:35:16,269
Threatening a divorce.

375
00:35:16,304 --> 00:35:18,966
She thought we were spending
too much time together.

376
00:35:19,007 --> 00:35:21,202
Spoiled rich girl, I suppose.

377
00:35:21,242 --> 00:35:23,335
That's right.

378
00:35:25,513 --> 00:35:27,811
This work you're doing...

379
00:35:27,849 --> 00:35:30,977
is it the kind of thing
that will lead to anything?

380
00:35:31,019 --> 00:35:34,420
I don't know.

381
00:35:34,455 --> 00:35:37,049
Nevertheless,
it's the kind of work I do.

382
00:36:36,117 --> 00:36:39,883
I don't suppose Paris
ever gets as exciting as this.

383
00:38:03,871 --> 00:38:08,069
You look like a fucking saint.

384
00:38:23,124 --> 00:38:27,060
Except you haven't
got your halo.

385
00:38:34,001 --> 00:38:36,868
I'll give you your halo.

386
00:39:26,087 --> 00:39:28,783
He's back, isn't he?

387
00:39:34,595 --> 00:39:36,961
I can't leave
Mathilde at the moment.

388
00:39:36,998 --> 00:39:38,488
She's not very well.

389
00:39:38,533 --> 00:39:42,025
I'm not surprised if you keep
setting fire to her.

390
00:39:42,069 --> 00:39:45,436
I haven't set fire
to her since Thursday.

391
00:39:52,613 --> 00:39:54,604
No, it's not very funny.

392
00:40:05,126 --> 00:40:07,651
It's pathetic.

393
00:40:07,695 --> 00:40:11,096
Your acts of violence
are always curiously disgusting.

394
00:40:11,132 --> 00:40:13,191
What do you mean?

395
00:40:15,136 --> 00:40:17,627
They're not clean.

396
00:40:17,672 --> 00:40:20,869
You're always in
some sort of a drunken stupor.

397
00:40:20,908 --> 00:40:24,241
Then you start
apologizing and groveling.

398
00:40:24,278 --> 00:40:26,246
I don't like hurting people.

399
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,248
Then don't.

400
00:40:28,282 --> 00:40:31,251
But if you do, do it coolly.

401
00:40:31,285 --> 00:40:35,187
Don't insult your victims
by feeling sorry afterwards.

402
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:40,527
I love her, you see.

403
00:40:40,561 --> 00:40:43,029
You can't possibly.

404
00:40:43,064 --> 00:40:44,998
I love her body.

405
00:40:47,969 --> 00:40:49,800
There are other bodies.

406
00:40:53,174 --> 00:40:55,734
I love Mathilde's body.

407
00:40:55,776 --> 00:40:59,371
But not her soul?

408
00:40:59,413 --> 00:41:02,507
I think it's less important
to love the soul.

409
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:05,018
After all,
the soul may be immortal.

410
00:41:05,052 --> 00:41:08,021
We have plenty
of time for the soul...

411
00:41:08,055 --> 00:41:11,252
but flesh rots.

412
00:41:11,292 --> 00:41:16,628
It's my love of flesh
which keeps me faithful.

413
00:41:16,664 --> 00:41:19,827
Faithful.

414
00:41:19,867 --> 00:41:21,061
What do you mean?

415
00:41:21,102 --> 00:41:25,004
I'm faithful to all my lovers...

416
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:27,098
because once I love them...

417
00:41:27,141 --> 00:41:31,168
I will always love them...

418
00:41:31,212 --> 00:41:33,112
and when I'm alone
in the evening...

419
00:41:33,147 --> 00:41:35,115
or in the early morning...

420
00:41:35,149 --> 00:41:37,344
I close my eyes...

421
00:41:37,385 --> 00:41:40,354
and I celebrate them all.

422
00:41:40,388 --> 00:41:45,325
That's not faithfulness.
That's nostalgia.

423
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:47,350
If you don't want
to leave Mathilde...

424
00:41:47,395 --> 00:41:49,260
it's not
because you're faithful.

425
00:41:49,296 --> 00:41:50,729
It's because you're weak.

426
00:41:50,765 --> 00:41:55,134
If strength involves brutality,
I prefer to be weak.

427
00:41:58,072 --> 00:42:01,269
With you, weakness involves
brutality as well.

428
00:42:10,618 --> 00:42:14,349
Don't expect me
to be faithful to you.

429
00:42:14,388 --> 00:42:16,822
Why are you so harsh with me?

430
00:42:16,857 --> 00:42:19,018
Because you need it.

431
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:22,029
Isn't it enough
for you to know...

432
00:42:22,063 --> 00:42:24,930
that I love you more
than I've ever loved anyone...

433
00:42:24,965 --> 00:42:28,526
and that I will always love you?

434
00:42:28,569 --> 00:42:30,969
Shut up, you sniveling drunk.

435
00:42:31,005 --> 00:42:33,769
- Tell me that you love me.
- For God's sake!

436
00:42:33,808 --> 00:42:35,605
Please.

437
00:42:37,745 --> 00:42:39,736
It's important.

438
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:42,544
Just say it.

439
00:42:46,854 --> 00:42:49,948
You know I'm very fond of you.

440
00:42:57,131 --> 00:42:59,929
- Do you love me?
- What?

441
00:43:01,102 --> 00:43:05,505
- Do you love me?
- Yes.

442
00:43:05,539 --> 00:43:08,565
Then put your hands
on the table.

443
00:43:08,609 --> 00:43:10,076
What?

444
00:43:10,111 --> 00:43:13,171
Put your hand on the table.

445
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:17,776
Palm upwards.

446
00:44:00,361 --> 00:44:04,263
The only unbearable thing
is that nothing is unbearable.

447
00:45:28,649 --> 00:45:29,946
On...

448
00:45:32,253 --> 00:45:33,948
On...

449
00:45:42,429 --> 00:45:44,124
We have to leave.

450
00:45:45,633 --> 00:45:48,067
I don't know.

451
00:45:48,102 --> 00:45:51,094
Yes. It's time.

452
00:45:51,138 --> 00:45:53,606
The happiest days
of my life was last year...

453
00:45:53,641 --> 00:45:55,438
when I ran away from home.

454
00:45:57,978 --> 00:46:01,175
Didn't know where I was going.
I just carried on.

455
00:46:04,018 --> 00:46:09,012
I've never seen
such long and colored days...

456
00:46:09,056 --> 00:46:11,547
and I could never
get far enough.

457
00:46:13,093 --> 00:46:15,061
I've never seen the sea.

458
00:46:15,095 --> 00:46:18,360
I wanted to walk to Africa...

459
00:46:18,399 --> 00:46:20,526
and cross the desert.

460
00:46:20,567 --> 00:46:24,435
I wanted the sun.

461
00:46:24,471 --> 00:46:27,099
I wanted the sun.

462
00:46:27,141 --> 00:46:29,735
I want the sun.

463
00:46:29,777 --> 00:46:32,245
Do you understand me?
I want the sun!

464
00:46:32,279 --> 00:46:36,375
Where do you want to go?

465
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:40,514
I don't know.

466
00:46:40,554 --> 00:46:43,022
I don't care. Just away.

467
00:46:43,057 --> 00:46:45,821
I can't leave Mathilde
right now.

468
00:46:45,859 --> 00:46:47,520
She's not very well.

469
00:46:47,561 --> 00:46:48,892
Then don't.

470
00:46:48,929 --> 00:46:50,726
What?

471
00:46:50,764 --> 00:46:53,597
Don't leave her.

472
00:48:32,966 --> 00:48:34,593
Wait!

473
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,610
To life.

474
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:01,053
Come on!

475
00:54:36,062 --> 00:54:38,223
Do you remember happier times?

476
00:54:40,133 --> 00:54:42,465
Why did you leave us?

477
00:54:46,039 --> 00:54:48,599
I had a tip-off I was going
to arrested for my work...

478
00:54:48,642 --> 00:54:51,611
in the propaganda press
during the Commune.

479
00:54:51,645 --> 00:54:54,113
But that was over a year ago.

480
00:54:54,147 --> 00:54:58,277
Well...
the police may be slow...

481
00:54:58,318 --> 00:55:00,809
but they're methodical.

482
00:55:00,854 --> 00:55:03,084
I couldn't bear to go to jail.

483
00:55:04,458 --> 00:55:08,588
I think it's best to stay out
of the country for a few months.

484
00:55:08,628 --> 00:55:10,596
With Rimbaud?

485
00:55:12,466 --> 00:55:13,899
Well...

486
00:55:13,934 --> 00:55:17,426
I suppose he's wanted
by the police as well.

487
00:55:17,471 --> 00:55:18,870
No.

488
00:55:22,042 --> 00:55:25,068
Why do you prefer him to me?

489
00:55:25,111 --> 00:55:28,046
I don't.

490
00:55:34,054 --> 00:55:36,022
Don't have to get dressed
right away, do you?

491
00:55:36,056 --> 00:55:39,822
I told Mummy
I'd meet her for breakfast.

492
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:42,385
- What's she doing here?
- She came with me.

493
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:48,659
That's another thing.

494
00:55:48,702 --> 00:55:53,105
I certainly can't stand living
with your parents anymore.

495
00:55:53,139 --> 00:55:56,108
It's not safe anywhere else.

496
00:55:56,142 --> 00:55:58,110
What do you mean?

497
00:55:58,144 --> 00:56:00,203
You know what I mean.

498
00:56:01,648 --> 00:56:04,845
Listen...

499
00:56:04,885 --> 00:56:07,479
I had this idea.

500
00:56:07,521 --> 00:56:09,614
I thought of this idea.

501
00:56:13,093 --> 00:56:15,584
I thought we might emigrate.

502
00:56:17,898 --> 00:56:20,833
Emigrate? Where to?

503
00:56:20,867 --> 00:56:22,266
New Caledonia.

504
00:56:22,302 --> 00:56:27,296
A lot of your friends
from the Commune are there.

505
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:30,309
You'd be able to write.

506
00:56:30,343 --> 00:56:34,279
It would be like it was when
we were first married and...

507
00:56:35,282 --> 00:56:36,715
What?

508
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:38,650
Nothing.

509
00:56:40,654 --> 00:56:42,281
No. Go on.

510
00:56:43,957 --> 00:56:48,087
I was only going to say
that you could stop...

511
00:56:48,128 --> 00:56:49,618
If you wanted...

512
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:54,657
It would be easier for you
if you wanted to stop drinking.

513
00:57:05,145 --> 00:57:07,579
You're frightened of me,
aren't you?

514
00:57:09,816 --> 00:57:13,752
Don't think
that I like getting drunk.

515
00:57:13,787 --> 00:57:15,550
I mean,
I do like getting drunk.

516
00:57:15,589 --> 00:57:18,183
I don't like being drunk.

517
00:57:18,224 --> 00:57:21,284
Anyway...

518
00:57:21,328 --> 00:57:23,728
when I hit you...

519
00:57:23,763 --> 00:57:25,492
I feel so terrible
all I can think of...

520
00:57:25,532 --> 00:57:28,592
is to get drunk again
and forget about it.

521
00:57:28,635 --> 00:57:32,196
Can you see us
living in a grass hut?

522
00:57:32,238 --> 00:57:33,705
Why not?

523
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:35,833
Let's go, for Christ's sake.

524
00:57:35,875 --> 00:57:38,571
Let's go before it's too late.

525
00:57:38,612 --> 00:57:41,706
We can go whenever you like.

526
00:57:52,626 --> 00:57:54,355
Not now!

527
00:57:54,394 --> 00:57:56,362
Why not?

528
00:57:56,396 --> 00:57:59,854
Help me with this.

529
00:57:59,899 --> 00:58:01,526
No.

530
00:58:01,568 --> 00:58:04,002
Help me with this.

531
00:58:04,037 --> 00:58:06,005
Stop!

532
00:58:15,148 --> 00:58:18,606
Why are you doing this to us?

533
00:58:18,652 --> 00:58:20,620
Don't worry.

534
00:58:20,654 --> 00:58:24,112
You can have him
back quite soon...

535
00:58:24,157 --> 00:58:27,149
and only slightly damaged.

536
00:58:28,662 --> 00:58:30,653
He's coming back now.

537
00:58:45,178 --> 00:58:47,146
What are you doing here?

538
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:48,807
What's this?

539
00:58:48,848 --> 00:58:50,782
"My poor Mathilde...

540
00:58:50,817 --> 00:58:52,648
"Don't be upset. Don't cry.

541
00:58:52,686 --> 00:58:54,654
"This is a bad dream.

542
00:58:54,688 --> 00:58:57,213
"One day, I'll wake up.
Love, Paul."

543
00:58:57,257 --> 00:59:00,590
Nice, was it?
Scene of conjugal bliss?

544
00:59:00,627 --> 00:59:03,562
I'm going back
to Paris with her.

545
00:59:03,596 --> 00:59:05,291
Right.

546
00:59:07,133 --> 00:59:10,694
- Wait! Let me explain.
- Why should I?

547
00:59:10,737 --> 00:59:14,434
It's not what you think.
It's something else.

548
00:59:14,474 --> 00:59:17,136
She suggested we emigrate
to New Caledonia.

549
00:59:17,177 --> 00:59:18,906
It would be a change.
A quiet life.

550
00:59:18,945 --> 00:59:21,311
I could stop drinking.
It's a good idea.

551
00:59:21,347 --> 00:59:22,939
No.

552
00:59:22,982 --> 00:59:25,644
Don't you care about
my happiness?

553
00:59:25,685 --> 00:59:27,050
No, and neither should you.

554
00:59:27,087 --> 00:59:29,419
You don't understand
how much I love her.

555
00:59:29,456 --> 00:59:32,050
This morning,
she was lying there naked.

556
00:59:32,092 --> 00:59:37,724
She looked so beautiful,
so young and so...

557
00:59:37,764 --> 00:59:39,493
What's so funny?

558
00:59:39,532 --> 00:59:40,897
Was she really
lying there naked?

559
00:59:40,934 --> 00:59:42,060
Yes.

560
00:59:42,102 --> 00:59:44,627
My estimation for her
goes up a long way.

561
00:59:44,671 --> 00:59:45,968
Why?

562
00:59:46,005 --> 00:59:50,635
For realizing what was needed
and providing it.

563
00:59:50,677 --> 00:59:52,144
What does it matter?

564
00:59:52,178 --> 00:59:54,646
You love her, right?
Go back to her.

565
01:00:45,565 --> 01:00:49,023
All change!

566
01:00:49,068 --> 01:00:50,535
Border patrol!

567
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:54,062
Please have your passports
ready for inspection.

568
01:00:55,575 --> 01:00:57,543
Border patrol!

569
01:00:57,577 --> 01:01:01,513
Please have your passports
ready for inspection.

570
01:01:33,213 --> 01:01:34,544
Thank you.

571
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:50,028
I'm just going
to find a newspaper.

572
01:01:50,063 --> 01:01:51,394
Don't be long.

573
01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:36,030
Look there.

574
01:02:37,210 --> 01:02:39,007
See white?

575
01:02:39,045 --> 01:02:40,535
See?

576
01:02:43,683 --> 01:02:46,049
It's England.

577
01:02:51,891 --> 01:02:55,019
"I became a fabulous opera.

578
01:02:55,061 --> 01:02:59,054
"I saw that all creatures
are condemned to happiness."

579
01:03:03,169 --> 01:03:06,036
What's this?
Are you going back to rhyme?

580
01:03:06,072 --> 01:03:09,132
"I have researched
the magic shapes...

581
01:03:09,175 --> 01:03:11,666
"of the happiness
no one escapes."

582
01:03:13,012 --> 01:03:14,206
That's wonderful.

583
01:03:16,983 --> 01:03:20,475
I've often wondered
why you chose to write to me.

584
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:22,488
You're so far up ahead...

585
01:03:22,522 --> 01:03:25,491
I can never understand
the signs you're making.

586
01:03:25,525 --> 01:03:28,494
You make me feel
I'm from another century.

587
01:03:30,363 --> 01:03:32,331
"I've researched
magic shapes...

588
01:03:32,365 --> 01:03:34,492
of the happiness
no one escapes."

589
01:03:34,534 --> 01:03:35,796
It's wonderful.

590
01:03:35,835 --> 01:03:39,202
I chose you
for a very good reason.

591
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:42,530
You see...

592
01:03:44,544 --> 01:03:47,638
I've always known what to say...

593
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:52,583
but you... you know how to say.

594
01:03:52,618 --> 01:03:55,018
I thought
I could learn from you...

595
01:03:55,054 --> 01:03:56,885
and I have.

596
01:04:08,835 --> 01:04:10,666
What's your greatest fear?

597
01:04:13,006 --> 01:04:15,770
I wouldn't like
to mislay my balls.

598
01:04:15,808 --> 01:04:18,003
What's your greatest fear?

599
01:04:18,044 --> 01:04:21,445
That other people
will see me as I see them.

600
01:04:26,486 --> 01:04:29,478
Getting quite short
of money, you know.

601
01:04:29,522 --> 01:04:31,490
So you keep saying.

602
01:04:31,524 --> 01:04:33,685
Perhaps it's time we took a job.

603
01:04:33,726 --> 01:04:35,990
I have no intention
of taking a job.

604
01:04:36,029 --> 01:04:37,997
My work is going far too well.

605
01:04:38,031 --> 01:04:40,522
I can't afford to waste time
earning money.

606
01:04:48,041 --> 01:04:51,499
I... I had a letter
this morning...

607
01:04:51,544 --> 01:04:53,512
from Mathilde's lawyer.

608
01:04:53,546 --> 01:04:55,013
And?

609
01:04:55,048 --> 01:04:58,176
She's applied for
legal separation on grounds...

610
01:04:58,217 --> 01:05:01,448
that you and I are indulging
in immoral relations.

611
01:05:01,487 --> 01:05:02,954
And?

612
01:05:02,989 --> 01:05:05,958
- Like a hat, sir?
- Possibly.

613
01:05:05,992 --> 01:05:08,825
There you are. Take a look.

614
01:05:11,497 --> 01:05:13,624
He wants to know
if we're prepared...

615
01:05:13,666 --> 01:05:16,294
to submit
to a medical examination.

616
01:05:16,335 --> 01:05:17,802
What?

617
01:05:17,837 --> 01:05:20,431
How can they make such
outrageous accusations?

618
01:05:20,473 --> 01:05:22,805
I'm going to write and say
as far as I'm concerned...

619
01:05:22,842 --> 01:05:25,140
all of them
can look up our asses.

620
01:05:25,178 --> 01:05:26,645
What are you, insane?

621
01:05:26,679 --> 01:05:29,477
They can give her a divorce
on desertion alone.

622
01:05:29,515 --> 01:05:32,814
If it's desertion and sodomy,
they can throw us both in jail.

623
01:05:32,852 --> 01:05:34,479
I'm not going to jail.

624
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:38,752
I don't know.
Would it be so bad?

625
01:05:50,536 --> 01:05:52,197
Latavia...

626
01:05:52,238 --> 01:05:56,436
I can hear the wind
rustling in the palm trees.

627
01:07:08,314 --> 01:07:09,975
What's the matter?

628
01:07:12,985 --> 01:07:16,352
It's so difficult.

629
01:07:16,389 --> 01:07:20,485
Who would have imagined
it would be so difficult?

630
01:07:20,526 --> 01:07:22,960
I wrote to the lawyer today.

631
01:07:22,995 --> 01:07:28,126
I explained it's her father
who's in the wrong.

632
01:07:28,167 --> 01:07:31,830
How many times have I asked
for my things from that house...

633
01:07:31,871 --> 01:07:36,365
and he takes no notice
whatsoever?

634
01:07:36,409 --> 01:07:39,469
You're in the wrong.

635
01:07:41,614 --> 01:07:43,582
All right.

636
01:07:43,616 --> 01:07:45,584
All right. I'm in the wrong.

637
01:07:45,618 --> 01:07:48,109
I'm in the wrong, if you say so.

638
01:07:48,154 --> 01:07:49,985
That's established, isn't it?

639
01:07:50,022 --> 01:07:51,785
So...

640
01:07:55,828 --> 01:07:57,921
I don't know.

641
01:07:57,964 --> 01:08:01,092
What... What is it?
You seem different.

642
01:08:02,902 --> 01:08:04,233
Yes.

643
01:08:05,571 --> 01:08:07,869
It's the writing.

644
01:08:07,907 --> 01:08:10,068
The writing has changed me.

645
01:08:27,593 --> 01:08:28,890
On.

646
01:08:30,062 --> 01:08:31,393
On.

647
01:08:32,898 --> 01:08:34,058
On.

648
01:09:26,886 --> 01:09:30,014
I suppose you think
I've been just lying here...

649
01:09:30,056 --> 01:09:33,856
all these weeks
in a state of paralyzed sloth.

650
01:09:33,893 --> 01:09:36,054
Well, not necessarily.

651
01:09:38,064 --> 01:09:39,827
Well, I have.

652
01:09:41,567 --> 01:09:43,728
But bubbling
beneath the surface...

653
01:09:43,769 --> 01:09:46,397
and rising slowly through
the layers of indifference...

654
01:09:46,439 --> 01:09:48,532
has come a new system...

655
01:09:48,574 --> 01:09:52,135
harden up, reject romanticism...

656
01:09:52,178 --> 01:09:54,078
abandon rhetoric...

657
01:09:55,581 --> 01:09:57,549
Get it right.

658
01:09:57,583 --> 01:10:00,211
And finally
I've seen where my attempt...

659
01:10:00,252 --> 01:10:02,345
to conquer the world has led me.

660
01:10:02,388 --> 01:10:04,754
Where has it led you?

661
01:10:11,597 --> 01:10:13,087
Here.

662
01:10:15,267 --> 01:10:19,260
My search for universal
experience has led me here...

663
01:10:21,273 --> 01:10:27,075
to live an idle,
pointless life of poverty...

664
01:10:27,113 --> 01:10:32,574
as the minion
of a bald, ugly...

665
01:10:32,618 --> 01:10:36,076
aging, drunken lyric poet...

666
01:10:36,122 --> 01:10:42,584
who clings to me because
his wife won't take him back.

667
01:10:42,628 --> 01:10:45,096
How can you bring yourself
to say a thing like that?

668
01:10:45,131 --> 01:10:49,090
It's easy. It's the truth.

669
01:10:49,135 --> 01:10:52,434
You're here living like this
because you have to...

670
01:10:52,471 --> 01:10:56,134
drink and sex and a kind
of complacent melancholy...

671
01:10:56,175 --> 01:10:59,269
and enough money to soak
yourself oblivious every night.

672
01:10:59,311 --> 01:11:03,008
But me... l'm here
because I choose to be.

673
01:11:03,048 --> 01:11:05,016
Yes?

674
01:11:05,050 --> 01:11:07,143
Yes.

675
01:11:12,291 --> 01:11:14,782
And why exactly?

676
01:11:16,629 --> 01:11:19,792
Why did you choose
to come to London with me?

677
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:25,259
No doubt you regarded it as
another stage in your odyssey...

678
01:11:25,304 --> 01:11:29,138
only by plunging ever deeper,
if I may mix my myths...

679
01:11:29,175 --> 01:11:33,009
will you gain the right to graze
on the slopes of Parnassus.

680
01:11:36,148 --> 01:11:39,049
Of course there are
less subtle reasons...

681
01:11:39,084 --> 01:11:40,574
for putting up with me.

682
01:11:40,619 --> 01:11:43,110
Such as?

683
01:11:43,155 --> 01:11:45,646
Such as the fact
that I support you.

684
01:11:51,997 --> 01:11:55,489
Your mind is almost
as ugly as your body.

685
01:12:10,783 --> 01:12:12,648
Where are you going?

686
01:12:25,898 --> 01:12:27,798
- Are they fresh?
- Yes.

687
01:12:33,973 --> 01:12:35,463
This one.

688
01:12:52,491 --> 01:12:54,186
God, you look such a cunt.

689
01:13:06,672 --> 01:13:08,333
Where are you going?

690
01:13:08,374 --> 01:13:11,104
Where are you going?

691
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:15,738
Wait!

692
01:13:15,781 --> 01:13:17,248
Paul, wait!

693
01:13:26,959 --> 01:13:28,290
Move!

694
01:13:32,731 --> 01:13:34,426
Don't go!

695
01:13:34,466 --> 01:13:36,263
Come back!

696
01:13:36,302 --> 01:13:38,293
Don't leave me!

697
01:13:40,139 --> 01:13:42,630
Come back!

698
01:13:42,675 --> 01:13:44,575
I'm sorry!

699
01:13:48,514 --> 01:13:50,482
I'm sorry!

700
01:13:54,353 --> 01:13:57,447
How am I supposed to live?

701
01:13:57,489 --> 01:14:00,049
Come back.

702
01:14:00,092 --> 01:14:03,789
Please come back.
You're my only friend.

703
01:14:03,829 --> 01:14:05,057
I promise you
I'll behave myself.

704
01:14:05,097 --> 01:14:07,395
It was only a stupid joke.

705
01:14:07,433 --> 01:14:08,900
Sir?

706
01:14:08,934 --> 01:14:12,392
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

707
01:14:12,438 --> 01:14:16,101
When I called you,
why didn't you get off the boat?

708
01:14:16,141 --> 01:14:19,941
We lived together for
two years to finish like this?

709
01:14:21,947 --> 01:14:25,906
Think back to what you were
before you met me.

710
01:14:25,951 --> 01:14:28,419
Listen to your heart.

711
01:14:28,454 --> 01:14:30,786
Yours for always.

712
01:15:07,926 --> 01:15:10,417
I'll go back to Paris tomorrow.

713
01:15:18,771 --> 01:15:22,400
Look...

714
01:15:22,441 --> 01:15:26,138
it won't happen again.

715
01:15:26,178 --> 01:15:28,908
I'll never walk out
on you again, I promise.

716
01:15:28,947 --> 01:15:31,313
No, you won't.

717
01:15:31,350 --> 01:15:34,751
I'm not going
to give you the chance.

718
01:15:34,787 --> 01:15:37,915
What was I supposed to do
in London with no money?

719
01:15:37,956 --> 01:15:40,948
I'm sorry. I was very hot.

720
01:15:40,993 --> 01:15:44,360
For God's sakes, why?

721
01:15:44,396 --> 01:15:47,331
I've said far worse things
to you than that.

722
01:15:58,210 --> 01:16:00,906
You really did look like a cunt.

723
01:16:40,953 --> 01:16:42,944
Where have you been?

724
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:49,650
Out.

725
01:16:50,662 --> 01:16:52,562
I went to
the Spanish embassy again...

726
01:16:52,598 --> 01:16:55,431
to see if they'd change
their minds, but they wouldn't.

727
01:16:55,467 --> 01:16:57,435
It's fucking ridiculous.

728
01:16:57,469 --> 01:17:00,905
"I'm willing to fight
and die for your cause.

729
01:17:00,939 --> 01:17:02,463
"You can't afford to turn
away volunteers."

730
01:17:02,508 --> 01:17:05,204
They said they weren't
taking on any foreigners.

731
01:17:05,244 --> 01:17:07,644
Then I said, "You deserve
to lose the fucking war...

732
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:09,704
"and I hope you do."

733
01:17:09,748 --> 01:17:12,376
You were at
the Spanish embassy all morning?

734
01:17:12,417 --> 01:17:13,748
No.

735
01:17:15,420 --> 01:17:16,887
You're drunk.

736
01:17:16,922 --> 01:17:19,914
I have, yes, had a few drinks.

737
01:17:22,594 --> 01:17:24,061
What are you doing?

738
01:17:24,096 --> 01:17:25,961
Packing.

739
01:17:25,998 --> 01:17:27,556
Where are you going?

740
01:17:27,599 --> 01:17:30,067
I'm going back home to Roche.

741
01:17:30,102 --> 01:17:33,333
I'm going to finish my book
and have it published.

742
01:17:33,372 --> 01:17:35,897
Oh, publish.

743
01:17:35,941 --> 01:17:38,739
I thought you were
far too important for that.

744
01:17:38,777 --> 01:17:42,235
Anyway, I've decided.
We're going back to London.

745
01:17:42,281 --> 01:17:44,306
We're not going back to London.

746
01:17:44,349 --> 01:17:46,613
It's by far the best idea.

747
01:17:46,652 --> 01:17:48,916
Then why did you go
to the Spanish embassy?

748
01:17:48,954 --> 01:17:50,216
I didn't.

749
01:17:52,124 --> 01:17:55,423
Don't go. Think it over.

750
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:57,121
I've thought it over.

751
01:18:06,905 --> 01:18:09,237
Do you know what day
it is tomorrow?

752
01:18:09,274 --> 01:18:11,071
Friday.

753
01:18:12,244 --> 01:18:15,042
It's my wedding anniversary...

754
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:17,674
and I haven't seen her,
my wife...

755
01:18:17,716 --> 01:18:21,049
since we made love here
in Brussels nearly a year ago.

756
01:18:21,086 --> 01:18:23,111
She won't answer my letters.

757
01:18:23,155 --> 01:18:26,522
I wrote her if she didn't come
to Brussels within 3 days...

758
01:18:26,558 --> 01:18:29,152
I'd commit suicide,
and she didn't even reply.

759
01:18:29,194 --> 01:18:32,027
But then you didn't
commit suicide.

760
01:18:33,932 --> 01:18:36,400
I suppose
you think that's funny.

761
01:18:36,435 --> 01:18:38,266
No, it's pitiful.

762
01:18:38,303 --> 01:18:41,761
How many people did you tell
you were committing suicide?

763
01:18:41,807 --> 01:18:44,935
I'm surprised you didn't
send out invitations.

764
01:18:48,847 --> 01:18:52,180
How can you be so callous?

765
01:18:52,217 --> 01:18:56,347
Callous?
You abandon me in London...

766
01:18:56,388 --> 01:18:58,549
then summon me to Brussels
and expect me to hang around...

767
01:18:58,590 --> 01:19:01,184
while you decide whether
to leave your wife...

768
01:19:01,226 --> 01:19:03,694
join the army,
or shoot yourself?

769
01:19:03,729 --> 01:19:05,697
Then when you fail
to achieve any of these aims...

770
01:19:05,731 --> 01:19:07,323
as you undoubtedly will...

771
01:19:07,366 --> 01:19:09,334
you want me to go
back to London with you!

772
01:19:09,368 --> 01:19:11,666
It's not gonna happen!
I'm leaving you!

773
01:19:11,703 --> 01:19:14,467
You can't.

774
01:19:14,506 --> 01:19:16,371
You can't!

775
01:19:16,408 --> 01:19:17,875
Look, look.

776
01:19:17,910 --> 01:19:20,378
Look, this summer...

777
01:19:20,412 --> 01:19:23,381
Remember last summer
when we set out...

778
01:19:23,415 --> 01:19:25,383
how wonderful it was?

779
01:19:25,417 --> 01:19:26,907
Remember?

780
01:19:28,921 --> 01:19:30,889
Why don't we go south?

781
01:19:30,923 --> 01:19:32,891
Late summer
on the Mediterranean...

782
01:19:32,925 --> 01:19:35,393
we could dedicate
ourselves to warmth.

783
01:19:35,427 --> 01:19:36,894
Or Africa.

784
01:19:36,929 --> 01:19:39,397
You've always wanted
to go to Africa.

785
01:19:39,431 --> 01:19:42,400
Just for a month,
then make up your mind.

786
01:19:42,434 --> 01:19:44,231
Look at the sun.

787
01:19:44,269 --> 01:19:45,930
No.

788
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:50,431
Why not?

789
01:19:53,445 --> 01:19:54,912
I can't.

790
01:19:54,947 --> 01:19:56,915
It's no good.

791
01:19:56,949 --> 01:19:58,917
It's too late.

792
01:19:58,951 --> 01:20:02,114
It's not!

793
01:20:04,957 --> 01:20:07,289
I promise you, it's not.

794
01:20:09,461 --> 01:20:13,420
You know if you leave me,
you'll kill me.

795
01:20:13,465 --> 01:20:15,933
I can't bear to be alone.

796
01:20:15,968 --> 01:20:19,426
I don't exist
without someone else.

797
01:20:19,471 --> 01:20:25,068
I don't care if you stay with me
out of pity, just stay!

798
01:20:27,980 --> 01:20:30,949
- I can't.
- Why not?

799
01:20:30,983 --> 01:20:32,951
You don't care.

800
01:20:32,985 --> 01:20:35,453
You have no idea
what this means.

801
01:20:35,487 --> 01:20:37,478
For God's sake, stop whining!

802
01:20:41,493 --> 01:20:42,983
It's very hot.

803
01:20:44,229 --> 01:20:46,993
Take off your coat.

804
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,491
I will.

805
01:20:51,837 --> 01:20:54,499
I did some shopping
this morning.

806
01:20:56,508 --> 01:20:58,169
I bought a gun.

807
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:02,708
What for?

808
01:21:02,748 --> 01:21:07,117
For you, for me...
for everybody.

809
01:21:11,957 --> 01:21:14,949
I hope you bought
plenty of ammunition.

810
01:21:24,936 --> 01:21:28,269
I'm not going
to let you go, you know.

811
01:21:28,306 --> 01:21:31,434
This is a rather
entertaining number.

812
01:21:31,476 --> 01:21:33,171
We haven't seen this one before.

813
01:21:33,211 --> 01:21:34,542
I'll kill you!

814
01:21:34,579 --> 01:21:36,774
For God's sake,
pull yourself together.

815
01:21:36,815 --> 01:21:38,715
I read your letter.

816
01:21:38,750 --> 01:21:41,446
You begged me to come back.

817
01:21:41,486 --> 01:21:44,455
You said you were crying
as you wrote it.

818
01:21:44,489 --> 01:21:46,787
I could see
your tears on the paper.

819
01:21:49,294 --> 01:21:53,162
That was before I thought
of pawning your clothes.

820
01:22:15,954 --> 01:22:19,390
I didn't mean to.

821
01:22:19,424 --> 01:22:21,517
Look what you've done.

822
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:24,427
I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.

823
01:22:24,463 --> 01:22:25,953
Look.

824
01:22:27,466 --> 01:22:29,934
Oh, my God. Kill me.

825
01:22:29,968 --> 01:22:31,299
Shoot me.

826
01:22:33,805 --> 01:22:35,067
Shoot me!

827
01:22:35,107 --> 01:22:37,439
How can I, you stupid fuck?

828
01:22:37,476 --> 01:22:39,944
You've just blown
a hole in my hand.

829
01:22:39,978 --> 01:22:42,469
Oh, God. What have I done?

830
01:22:46,218 --> 01:22:47,913
You missed.

831
01:22:49,054 --> 01:22:50,817
Open up!

832
01:22:53,325 --> 01:22:55,156
Open up in there!

833
01:22:56,595 --> 01:22:59,462
What exactly
are you doing in Brussels?

834
01:22:59,498 --> 01:23:02,399
I was hoping my wife
might come and join me here...

835
01:23:02,434 --> 01:23:06,336
as she had done on one occasion
since our separation.

836
01:23:06,371 --> 01:23:09,397
I fail to see how
the departure of a friend...

837
01:23:09,441 --> 01:23:11,238
could have cast you
into such despair.

838
01:23:11,276 --> 01:23:13,767
Did there perhaps exist
between you and Rimbaud...

839
01:23:13,812 --> 01:23:15,939
other relations
besides those of friendship?

840
01:23:15,981 --> 01:23:17,448
No.

841
01:23:18,950 --> 01:23:22,909
This is a suggestion
slanderously invented...

842
01:23:22,954 --> 01:23:26,082
by my wife and her family.

843
01:23:50,115 --> 01:23:53,812
Take off your trousers
and lie down on this, face down.

844
01:24:04,429 --> 01:24:06,397
Both doctors have testified...

845
01:24:06,431 --> 01:24:08,899
that on the basis
of their examination...

846
01:24:08,934 --> 01:24:11,402
they are satisfied
you have recently indulged...

847
01:24:11,436 --> 01:24:13,904
in both
active and passive sodomy.

848
01:24:13,939 --> 01:24:15,406
Have they?

849
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:17,408
Do you deny you're
a practicing sodomist?

850
01:24:17,442 --> 01:24:19,569
The word is sodomite.

851
01:24:19,611 --> 01:24:23,411
Whatever the word may be,
the activity it describes...

852
01:24:23,448 --> 01:24:26,281
is not one which is
encouraged in Brussels.

853
01:24:35,193 --> 01:24:38,924
Paul Verlaine,
the court finds you guilty...

854
01:24:38,964 --> 01:24:41,933
under Article 399
of the penal code...

855
01:24:41,967 --> 01:24:44,265
of grievous bodily harm
and sentences you...

856
01:24:44,302 --> 01:24:50,172
to a fine of two hundred francs
and two years imprisonment.

857
01:25:27,445 --> 01:25:29,436
Now what's the matter?

858
01:25:41,926 --> 01:25:43,450
Eat.

859
01:28:58,289 --> 01:29:00,257
God.

860
01:29:41,432 --> 01:29:43,923
What does it mean?

861
01:29:43,968 --> 01:29:46,528
I don't understand
what it's supposed to mean.

862
01:29:46,571 --> 01:29:49,870
It means exactly what it says.

863
01:29:49,908 --> 01:29:51,967
Word for word.

864
01:29:52,010 --> 01:29:54,501
No more, no less.

865
01:30:32,050 --> 01:30:34,518
How are you?

866
01:30:34,552 --> 01:30:36,543
Where's your rosary?

867
01:30:38,056 --> 01:30:40,524
I thought you'd have a rosary.

868
01:30:40,558 --> 01:30:44,722
Is it true in prison
they called you Jesus Christ?

869
01:30:44,762 --> 01:30:48,528
It happened quite suddenly.

870
01:30:48,566 --> 01:30:52,297
When the governor said Mathilde
had been granted her divorce...

871
01:30:52,337 --> 01:30:55,704
I lay down
and looked at my life...

872
01:30:55,740 --> 01:30:59,005
and saw there was nothing.

873
01:30:59,043 --> 01:31:03,104
The only thing I could do
was submit myself to God...

874
01:31:03,147 --> 01:31:05,479
ask him to forgive me...

875
01:31:05,516 --> 01:31:07,984
and help me face
my situation and He did.

876
01:31:08,019 --> 01:31:11,318
I promise you He did.

877
01:31:11,356 --> 01:31:14,484
Now you want us to love
each other in Jesus?

878
01:31:14,525 --> 01:31:17,494
I want you to follow my example.

879
01:31:17,528 --> 01:31:21,931
I hope you didn't think
I might be angry with you.

880
01:31:21,966 --> 01:31:22,990
No.

881
01:31:23,034 --> 01:31:25,798
You didn't know
I'd be put away so long.

882
01:31:25,837 --> 01:31:27,964
I certainly forgave you for it.

883
01:31:28,006 --> 01:31:30,497
- I didn't forgive you.
- What for?

884
01:31:32,276 --> 01:31:33,538
For missing.

885
01:31:35,546 --> 01:31:38,515
Tell me. Why did you come here?

886
01:31:38,549 --> 01:31:44,010
I want you to find
some direction in your life.

887
01:31:44,055 --> 01:31:47,024
I want God to help you
achieve your aims.

888
01:31:47,058 --> 01:31:49,891
Aims? I have no aims.

889
01:31:49,927 --> 01:31:53,055
- Your writing.
- I've stopped writing.

890
01:31:53,097 --> 01:31:54,564
I don't understand.

891
01:31:54,599 --> 01:31:56,760
Let me put it another way.

892
01:31:56,801 --> 01:31:59,133
I no longer write.

893
01:31:59,170 --> 01:32:00,569
Why not?

894
01:32:00,605 --> 01:32:03,267
Because I have
nothing more to say.

895
01:32:03,307 --> 01:32:06,470
If I ever had anything
to say in the first place.

896
01:32:06,511 --> 01:32:08,502
Nonsense.

897
01:32:08,546 --> 01:32:12,505
I thought that what I did
would make a difference...

898
01:32:12,550 --> 01:32:15,849
change the world.

899
01:32:15,887 --> 01:32:19,846
I thought nothing
would ever be the same again.

900
01:32:19,891 --> 01:32:22,359
But it's no good.

901
01:32:22,393 --> 01:32:25,851
The world is too old,
and there's nothing new.

902
01:32:25,897 --> 01:32:28,024
It's all been said.

903
01:32:28,066 --> 01:32:32,025
Not in the way you can say it.
You have a gift.

904
01:32:32,070 --> 01:32:34,038
It's no good throwing it away...

905
01:32:34,072 --> 01:32:36,540
because your expectations
were unrealistic.

906
01:32:36,574 --> 01:32:39,042
It's the expectations
you should change.

907
01:32:39,077 --> 01:32:43,537
It's my gift.
I can do what I like with it.

908
01:32:43,581 --> 01:32:46,311
But you can't give up.
You've hardly begun.

909
01:32:46,350 --> 01:32:48,875
Don't worry.
I'll be very good at it.

910
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:51,889
No one will be able to touch me.

911
01:32:51,923 --> 01:32:54,790
The master of silence.

912
01:32:54,826 --> 01:32:58,887
But if we don't,
who's going to tell the truth?

913
01:32:58,930 --> 01:33:02,366
Three years ago, you said
the truth was this and that.

914
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:04,334
Then along comes
the angel of the Lord...

915
01:33:04,368 --> 01:33:08,566
and the truth is something
completely different.

916
01:33:08,606 --> 01:33:10,904
But I've changed. Change...

917
01:33:10,942 --> 01:33:14,173
I thought
that was what you wanted.

918
01:33:14,212 --> 01:33:16,339
You've changed, have you?

919
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:17,870
Yes.

920
01:33:23,888 --> 01:33:27,415
Then here, in the wilderness...

921
01:33:27,458 --> 01:33:30,359
I offer you
an archetypal choice...

922
01:33:30,394 --> 01:33:33,852
a choice between my body...

923
01:33:33,898 --> 01:33:36,867
and my soul.

924
01:33:36,901 --> 01:33:38,596
Choose.

925
01:33:40,404 --> 01:33:41,894
Choose.

926
01:33:45,910 --> 01:33:47,309
Your body.

927
01:33:49,147 --> 01:33:53,641
Let the ninety-eight wounds
of our Savior burst and bleed.

928
01:33:58,923 --> 01:34:00,356
Don't.

929
01:34:07,064 --> 01:34:10,329
Listen... I sat in my cell...

930
01:34:10,368 --> 01:34:12,836
and thought
how happy we could be.

931
01:34:12,870 --> 01:34:16,328
It should be the easiest
thing in the world.

932
01:34:16,374 --> 01:34:17,864
Why isn't it?

933
01:34:17,909 --> 01:34:20,844
Because it never worked for us.

934
01:34:20,878 --> 01:34:24,370
It will never work
for either of us.

935
01:34:24,415 --> 01:34:28,078
I wanted us to go away together.

936
01:34:28,119 --> 01:34:30,019
Yes.

937
01:34:30,054 --> 01:34:32,818
What am I going to do?

938
01:34:32,857 --> 01:34:36,349
You'll have to find
somebody else.

939
01:34:36,394 --> 01:34:37,793
No.

940
01:34:37,829 --> 01:34:39,797
No, no, I can't, please.

941
01:34:39,831 --> 01:34:41,355
- Let go.
- Please.

942
01:34:41,399 --> 01:34:43,867
Let go! Let go!

943
01:36:19,864 --> 01:36:22,833
"I shall return
with limbs of steel...

944
01:36:22,867 --> 01:36:27,668
"And dark skin and wrathful eye.

945
01:36:27,705 --> 01:36:30,833
"I shall have money.

946
01:36:30,875 --> 01:36:34,777
"I shall be cruel and idle.

947
01:36:34,812 --> 01:36:36,370
"I'll be saved."

948
01:36:38,883 --> 01:36:40,145
What?

949
01:36:40,184 --> 01:36:42,846
Something he wrote.

950
01:36:42,887 --> 01:36:45,685
The point is, Mr. Verlaine,
to speak frankly...

951
01:36:45,723 --> 01:36:48,191
a number of poems
he wrote in extreme youth...

952
01:36:48,225 --> 01:36:50,853
were quite indecent...

953
01:36:50,895 --> 01:36:53,523
and in some cases, even profane.

954
01:36:53,564 --> 01:36:56,533
He wouldn't have wished
to be remembered for them.

955
01:36:56,567 --> 01:37:00,025
My mother and I plan
to destroy those works...

956
01:37:00,071 --> 01:37:02,005
he would have destroyed himself.

957
01:37:02,039 --> 01:37:03,506
I see.

958
01:37:06,344 --> 01:37:09,313
What you may not know...

959
01:37:09,347 --> 01:37:12,874
is that Arthur was converted.

960
01:37:12,917 --> 01:37:14,908
Converted?

961
01:37:14,952 --> 01:37:17,819
I reasoned with him...

962
01:37:17,855 --> 01:37:22,815
and prayed for him
for weeks while he was ill...

963
01:37:22,860 --> 01:37:27,820
and eventually
he asked to be confessed.

964
01:37:27,865 --> 01:37:32,165
God kept him alive
long enough to repent...

965
01:37:32,203 --> 01:37:34,637
so that he could be saved.

966
01:37:34,672 --> 01:37:36,469
What was the matter with him?

967
01:37:36,507 --> 01:37:39,499
He had a tumor on his knee.

968
01:37:41,879 --> 01:37:44,848
That's very strange.

969
01:37:44,882 --> 01:37:46,850
Why?

970
01:37:46,884 --> 01:37:52,322
That's what I have...
a tumor on my knee.

971
01:37:53,858 --> 01:37:56,326
He spent ten years
in Abyssinia.

972
01:37:56,360 --> 01:37:58,123
He explored the whole country...

973
01:37:58,162 --> 01:38:01,063
places no white man
had ever been...

974
01:38:01,098 --> 01:38:04,795
and he ran
a trading post in Harar.

975
01:38:04,835 --> 01:38:07,429
There was no doctor there...

976
01:38:07,471 --> 01:38:10,304
but he wouldn't
leave his work.

977
01:38:10,341 --> 01:38:14,801
He insisted on staying until
the pain became unbearable.

978
01:38:14,845 --> 01:38:17,313
Then he designed
himself a litter...

979
01:38:17,348 --> 01:38:20,943
and hired ten men
to carry him to the coast.

980
01:38:22,853 --> 01:38:25,845
The journey
took more than two weeks.

981
01:38:27,858 --> 01:38:30,918
In Africa...

982
01:38:30,961 --> 01:38:34,328
did he write poetry?

983
01:38:34,365 --> 01:38:35,855
No.

984
01:39:54,378 --> 01:39:56,346
On.

985
01:39:56,380 --> 01:39:58,371
On.

986
01:40:07,191 --> 01:40:09,853
First, as soon as he arrived...

987
01:40:09,894 --> 01:40:12,863
he went into the hospital
in Marseilles...

988
01:40:15,399 --> 01:40:17,890
and they cut off his leg.

989
01:41:09,086 --> 01:41:11,850
What's the matter?

990
01:41:11,889 --> 01:41:15,882
Don't you see the carriages
driving in the sky?

991
01:41:26,403 --> 01:41:28,963
I have to help people, you see.

992
01:41:29,006 --> 01:41:31,372
It's my duty.

993
01:41:31,408 --> 01:41:33,376
I know you do.

994
01:41:33,410 --> 01:41:36,902
I don't want money
unless it's drenched in blood.

995
01:41:43,420 --> 01:41:46,412
Maybe the sea
will wash away the stains.

996
01:41:48,425 --> 01:41:49,824
Maybe.

997
01:41:55,432 --> 01:41:59,300
There's one thing, Isabelle,
you must promise me.

998
01:41:59,336 --> 01:42:01,827
It's very important.
Will you promise?

999
01:42:01,872 --> 01:42:03,362
What?

1000
01:42:07,478 --> 01:42:09,378
Never let them amputate.

1001
01:42:23,994 --> 01:42:26,519
He would only
stay at home a month.

1002
01:42:28,732 --> 01:42:32,224
He kept saying he had to travel
back towards the sun...

1003
01:42:33,971 --> 01:42:36,462
that the sun would heal him.

1004
01:43:47,911 --> 01:43:49,708
Please, don't get up.

1005
01:43:51,315 --> 01:43:53,374
Let me see you to your hotel.

1006
01:43:53,417 --> 01:43:55,885
No, no. It was an honor...

1007
01:43:55,919 --> 01:43:57,716
to meet such
a distinguished poet.

1008
01:43:59,923 --> 01:44:02,187
A pleasure to meet you.

1009
01:44:04,228 --> 01:44:07,823
You have my card, don't you?

1010
01:44:07,865 --> 01:44:11,323
Will you send the manuscripts
to that address?

1011
01:44:11,368 --> 01:44:14,030
- Of course.
- Please don't forget.

1012
01:44:14,071 --> 01:44:18,838
We shall make a very careful
selection of what is to survive.

1013
01:44:18,876 --> 01:44:20,366
Good-bye.

1014
01:44:37,294 --> 01:44:39,285
Absinthe... two.

1015
01:45:23,874 --> 01:45:26,001
Tell me if you love me.

1016
01:45:28,579 --> 01:45:30,774
You know I'm very fond of you.

1017
01:45:36,553 --> 01:45:37,781
Do you love me?

1018
01:45:41,124 --> 01:45:42,853
Put your hand on the table.

1019
01:45:42,893 --> 01:45:44,656
What?

1020
01:45:44,695 --> 01:45:47,220
Put your hand on the table.

1021
01:45:50,801 --> 01:45:52,928
Palm upwards.

1022
01:46:52,896 --> 01:46:56,354
Since he died,
I see him every night...

1023
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:59,733
my great and radiant sin.

1024
01:47:02,005 --> 01:47:06,305
We were always happy... always.

1025
01:47:06,343 --> 01:47:07,833
I remember.

1026
01:47:11,848 --> 01:47:13,372
I found it.

1027
01:47:15,852 --> 01:47:17,183
What?

1028
01:47:18,855 --> 01:47:21,323
Eternity.

1029
01:47:21,358 --> 01:47:24,816
It's the sun mingled...

1030
01:47:24,861 --> 01:47:26,658
with the sea.
