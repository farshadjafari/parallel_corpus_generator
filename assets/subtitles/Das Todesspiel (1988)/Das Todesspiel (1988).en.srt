1
00:01:43,577 --> 00:01:47,411
<i>A fire that claimed three lives</i>
<i>in a South Bay warehouse yesterday...</i>

2
00:01:47,614 --> 00:01:50,515
<i>... is believed to have been</i>
<i>deliberately set.</i>

3
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:53,983
<i>South Bay has been plagued</i>
<i>by a series of fires...</i>

4
00:01:54,188 --> 00:01:55,655
<i>... all of a similar nature.</i>

5
00:01:55,856 --> 00:01:58,290
<i>Authorities believe</i>
<i>arson is involved.</i>

6
00:01:58,492 --> 00:02:00,392
<i>They have no suspects at this time.</i>

7
00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:06,527
<i>Jazz composer Edward Barla was</i>
<i>eulogized today in a private ceremony.</i>

8
00:02:06,734 --> 00:02:10,693
<i>Barla was best known for the tunes</i>
<i>"Midnight Hearts" and "Just For You."</i>

9
00:02:10,904 --> 00:02:13,031
<i>Edward Barla, dead at the age of 56.</i>

10
00:02:15,809 --> 00:02:20,610
<i>The murder trial of Lou Janero ended</i>
<i>today. Samantha Walker has the story.</i>

11
00:02:20,814 --> 00:02:22,509
<i>After four days of deliberation...</i>

12
00:02:22,716 --> 00:02:26,584
<i>... the jury found Lou Janero guilty</i>
<i>of the murder of Paul Cirela.</i>

13
00:02:26,787 --> 00:02:31,451
<i>Cirela, part of Janero's organization,</i>
<i>was set to testify against Janero...</i>

14
00:02:31,658 --> 00:02:35,594
<i>... in an upcoming trial on charges</i>
<i>of bookmaking and tax evasion.</i>

15
00:02:35,796 --> 00:02:40,130
<i>Assistant D.A., Thomas McSherry,</i>
<i>credited Inspector Harry Callahan...</i>

16
00:02:40,334 --> 00:02:44,737
<i>... for his part in the successful</i>
<i>prosecution of Lou Janero.</i>

17
00:02:44,938 --> 00:02:48,806
<i>A great deal of the credit</i>
<i>should go to Inspector Callahan.</i>

18
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:51,136
<i>He put Lou Janero out of business.</i>

19
00:02:52,012 --> 00:02:56,972
<i>The inspector's evidence not only</i>
<i>implicated Janero in the murder...</i>

20
00:02:57,184 --> 00:03:02,053
<i>... but also provided the means to file</i>
<i>additional charges against Janero...</i>

21
00:03:02,256 --> 00:03:04,224
<i>... for bookmaking</i>
<i>and illegal gambling.</i>

22
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,688
<i>I'm Samantha Walker for Channel 8.</i>
<i>Back to you, Pat.</i>

23
00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:57,637
Get off my ass.

24
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,198
He's going.

25
00:06:40,974 --> 00:06:43,408
Did you recognize
any of the attackers?

26
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:47,307
Is this attack connected to your
testimony at the Janero trial?

27
00:06:47,514 --> 00:06:50,608
Has Janero put out a contract
on your life?

28
00:06:50,817 --> 00:06:52,444
Were these Janero's men?

29
00:06:52,652 --> 00:06:54,449
Have you received death threats?

30
00:06:55,255 --> 00:06:57,815
Has the department offered
any extra protection?

31
00:06:58,025 --> 00:07:01,017
The department will issue
a complete statement...

32
00:07:01,228 --> 00:07:04,527
...as soon as we've conducted
our own investigation.

33
00:07:05,065 --> 00:07:08,501
$13,453.63.

34
00:07:08,702 --> 00:07:11,466
That's how much
an unmarked squad car costs.

35
00:07:11,671 --> 00:07:14,162
That's the third car
you've trashed this month.

36
00:07:14,374 --> 00:07:16,274
- Lou Janero.
- What?

37
00:07:16,476 --> 00:07:18,910
His men shot up the car.
Send him the bill.

38
00:07:19,112 --> 00:07:20,010
Very funny.

39
00:07:20,213 --> 00:07:24,081
See how funny it is behind a desk,
because you're off the street.

40
00:07:24,284 --> 00:07:25,581
All this for a car?

41
00:07:25,786 --> 00:07:27,947
At Lieutenant Ackerman's request.

42
00:07:28,155 --> 00:07:30,385
The chief approved.
It's for your own good.

43
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:34,390
- If you think I'm gonna...
- Just until we handle Janero.

44
00:07:34,594 --> 00:07:38,655
He may be in prison, but it's clear
he's calling the shots. Literally.

45
00:07:38,865 --> 00:07:43,564
Can't have our newest hero turned to
Swiss cheese before the commendation.

46
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,671
See? You're getting a commendation.

47
00:07:47,841 --> 00:07:49,365
Swell.

48
00:07:51,645 --> 00:07:54,614
It's time we took advantage
of the press you're getting.

49
00:07:54,815 --> 00:07:56,680
How do you propose to do that?

50
00:07:56,883 --> 00:08:01,582
It's my opinion that you should
work with me in public relations.

51
00:08:01,788 --> 00:08:04,985
Opinions are like assholes.
Everybody has one.

52
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,696
You don't realize what you've done
for the department's image.

53
00:08:10,897 --> 00:08:13,422
You just put a major
crime figure in prison.

54
00:08:13,633 --> 00:08:16,500
You've got an extremely high
visibility right now.

55
00:08:16,703 --> 00:08:18,170
And for once, it's positive.

56
00:08:18,405 --> 00:08:21,067
You know what that means
in terms of recruitment?

57
00:08:21,274 --> 00:08:24,072
Look at this.
Look at this copy we're getting.

58
00:08:24,277 --> 00:08:27,508
We've never been
this swamped for interviews.

59
00:08:27,714 --> 00:08:30,274
I'm not some dog-and-pony act.

60
00:08:31,418 --> 00:08:35,252
It's important we maximize your public
relations value while we can.

61
00:08:35,455 --> 00:08:39,289
Getting close and personal
with reporters isn't my job.

62
00:08:39,493 --> 00:08:42,053
Your job is to promote the department.

63
00:08:42,262 --> 00:08:44,856
How positive would it be
if I resigned...

64
00:08:45,065 --> 00:08:46,430
...lieutenant?

65
00:08:50,203 --> 00:08:52,000
Don't misunderstand me.

66
00:08:52,205 --> 00:08:55,766
Harry, all I'm asking for
is a little cooperation.

67
00:08:57,144 --> 00:09:00,841
All right, we don't have to pull you
off the street completely.

68
00:09:01,047 --> 00:09:03,447
If you'd just be more cooperative
with the press.

69
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,639
Anything else?

70
00:09:04,851 --> 00:09:06,284
Yeah.

71
00:09:07,521 --> 00:09:09,182
Quan, will you come in here?

72
00:09:10,891 --> 00:09:14,987
Quan's moving over from the youth gang
task force to Homicide.

73
00:09:15,195 --> 00:09:18,596
Good, Homicide can always use a cop
with Al's experience.

74
00:09:18,798 --> 00:09:19,992
I'm glad you agree.

75
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,068
If you want to stay on the street,
you take Quan to watch your back.

76
00:09:24,271 --> 00:09:26,000
- Now hold on.
- That's final.

77
00:09:26,206 --> 00:09:30,768
That's swell, being that most
of my partners end up hurt or dead.

78
00:09:30,977 --> 00:09:33,070
Ask Al how he feels about that.

79
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,875
Well, Quan? Any objections
to working with Callahan?

80
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,176
I think I can handle it.

81
00:09:39,986 --> 00:09:41,544
Get a bulletproof vest, kid.

82
00:09:42,489 --> 00:09:47,290
Teaming Harry with a Chinese-American
will be good for the department image.

83
00:09:53,533 --> 00:09:54,727
You have any kids?

84
00:09:54,935 --> 00:09:56,630
Me? No.

85
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,494
Lucky for them.

86
00:11:25,892 --> 00:11:27,189
Cut. Cut!

87
00:11:28,428 --> 00:11:31,886
You're out of sync, Johnny.
What's the problem here?

88
00:11:34,234 --> 00:11:35,667
Where is that fool?

89
00:11:35,869 --> 00:11:37,063
Jeff!

90
00:11:37,404 --> 00:11:38,371
Jeff!

91
00:11:38,571 --> 00:11:40,163
We've had a short, Peter.

92
00:11:40,373 --> 00:11:42,807
You had all the bugs out.
"Trust me," you said.

93
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:44,977
- Right? Did he say that?
- "Trust me."

94
00:11:45,178 --> 00:11:47,806
That means "fuck you"
in this business.

95
00:11:48,014 --> 00:11:48,844
I checked it.

96
00:11:49,049 --> 00:11:52,314
I've got a backup head.
Give me 20 minutes and we'll be ready.

97
00:11:52,619 --> 00:11:55,417
All right, do it.
And no cock-ups this time.

98
00:11:55,622 --> 00:11:58,352
And that goes for the rest
of you morons.

99
00:12:00,627 --> 00:12:02,424
This sucks, man.

100
00:12:03,196 --> 00:12:06,029
How can I sing
with shit exploding all over?

101
00:12:06,232 --> 00:12:07,665
It was just an accident.

102
00:12:07,867 --> 00:12:10,131
This whole movie is an accident.

103
00:12:10,337 --> 00:12:12,965
How did I get talked into this shit?

104
00:12:13,173 --> 00:12:16,472
You needed a video.
I needed this sequence for the film.

105
00:12:16,676 --> 00:12:19,110
Stop complaining,
we're getting what we want.

106
00:12:19,312 --> 00:12:24,181
Why couldn't we shoot on a warm
sound stage, instead of a meat locker?

107
00:12:24,384 --> 00:12:28,616
I need it cold so the audience
can see your breath when you sing.

108
00:12:28,822 --> 00:12:29,880
Brilliant.

109
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:34,254
We won't be original, but people
will know I froze my ass off.

110
00:12:34,461 --> 00:12:35,894
What's that supposed to mean?

111
00:12:36,096 --> 00:12:40,931
A director with talent would have
the guts to shoot something original.

112
00:12:41,134 --> 00:12:44,069
Instead of ripping off old movies
like <i>The Exorcist.</i>

113
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:48,707
This is not a rip-off,
it's a homage. You stupid...

114
00:12:53,313 --> 00:12:55,144
Jesus, I don't believe you.

115
00:12:55,949 --> 00:12:56,813
What?

116
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,244
You're hurting.

117
00:12:59,619 --> 00:13:01,052
I don't know what you mean.

118
00:13:01,254 --> 00:13:04,121
Don't give me that.
You promised, not during shooting.

119
00:13:04,324 --> 00:13:07,088
I know what I'm doing.

120
00:13:07,293 --> 00:13:08,282
I can handle it.

121
00:13:08,495 --> 00:13:09,928
You won't fuck up my film!

122
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,563
I said, I can handle it!

123
00:13:14,834 --> 00:13:19,430
Just let me go back to the trailer
and get it together.

124
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,340
Then we'll kick some ass.

125
00:13:22,542 --> 00:13:24,100
- OIKK?
- OIKK.

126
00:13:24,477 --> 00:13:25,444
Can I get a Coke?

127
00:13:25,645 --> 00:13:27,875
Get a Coke, please, for Johnny.

128
00:13:29,716 --> 00:13:30,580
Now what?

129
00:13:30,784 --> 00:13:33,275
Don't worry,
Johnny's like a trained seal.

130
00:13:33,486 --> 00:13:35,681
Throw him a fish, he'll perform.

131
00:13:59,312 --> 00:14:01,405
Rise and shine, boys.

132
00:14:02,715 --> 00:14:04,546
Time to get up.

133
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,354
What's happening?

134
00:15:38,444 --> 00:15:41,845
I always knew working Homicide
would be glamorous.

135
00:15:42,048 --> 00:15:44,676
I mean, meeting celebrities and all.

136
00:15:45,618 --> 00:15:48,143
Too bad you can't get his autograph.

137
00:15:48,955 --> 00:15:52,015
You know, Harry,
they always die in threes.

138
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:56,288
When one celebrity dies, two more
always go in a week or two.

139
00:15:57,664 --> 00:15:59,063
It's a fact, Harry.

140
00:15:59,265 --> 00:16:01,130
Celebrities always die in threes.

141
00:16:01,334 --> 00:16:05,065
Well, this one's got crystalline
powder around his nose and mouth.

142
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:07,296
Scabs up and down both arms.

143
00:16:07,507 --> 00:16:10,840
Fresh puncture marks
on his left forearm.

144
00:16:12,145 --> 00:16:16,309
Yeah, Homicide can be
really glamorous.

145
00:16:39,606 --> 00:16:41,904
All right,
check the dummy out, please.

146
00:16:42,508 --> 00:16:43,941
Meagan.

147
00:16:47,413 --> 00:16:50,041
I want a three-inch lens, very tight.

148
00:16:51,117 --> 00:16:52,516
Try not to drop it.

149
00:16:52,719 --> 00:16:56,519
Let's hurry up and shoot this
and wrap this up, please.

150
00:17:06,366 --> 00:17:10,097
And my second assistant and I
found Johnny in his trailer.

151
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:12,299
He was just lying there.

152
00:17:12,505 --> 00:17:14,837
At first we thought it was a joke.

153
00:17:15,141 --> 00:17:18,042
- But then, well...
- When did you last see him alive?

154
00:17:18,244 --> 00:17:20,007
About a half-hour before that.

155
00:17:20,213 --> 00:17:23,114
He went back to his trailer
while we set up.

156
00:17:23,316 --> 00:17:24,408
Was he alone?

157
00:17:24,617 --> 00:17:27,586
I don't know.
But he was alone when we found him.

158
00:17:28,321 --> 00:17:31,017
Tell me, does anyone
on your set use drugs?

159
00:17:31,224 --> 00:17:34,489
We don't do drugs, Callahan.
We do film.

160
00:17:36,062 --> 00:17:38,656
Look, what people do
is their own business.

161
00:17:38,865 --> 00:17:42,961
If it doesn't interfere with my film,
I really don't give a shit.

162
00:17:47,874 --> 00:17:49,671
What about Squares? Was he using?

163
00:17:49,876 --> 00:17:52,003
How should I know?

164
00:17:52,211 --> 00:17:54,111
Johnny had agents, lawyers, friends.

165
00:17:54,313 --> 00:17:57,942
It was their job to deal with his
drug problem, not mine.

166
00:17:58,151 --> 00:18:00,483
Well, that's a very caring attitude.

167
00:18:00,887 --> 00:18:04,516
What do you want, Callahan?
Drugs were Johnny's trademark.

168
00:18:04,724 --> 00:18:07,090
He made his career singing about them.

169
00:18:07,293 --> 00:18:08,885
It made him controversial.

170
00:18:09,362 --> 00:18:12,126
I can see why you'd want him
in your flick.

171
00:18:12,331 --> 00:18:14,026
It was a marketing decision.

172
00:18:14,233 --> 00:18:17,999
Johnny Squares sells tickets.
You know, bums on seats, love.

173
00:18:18,204 --> 00:18:20,468
Besides, we needed
a music video tie-in.

174
00:18:20,673 --> 00:18:22,402
Any idea who was supplying him?

175
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:28,203
No, but if I hear of anything,
you'll be the first one I call.

176
00:18:28,414 --> 00:18:30,348
Marvelous.

177
00:18:36,255 --> 00:18:39,122
Check on anyone
who dealt with Squares.

178
00:18:39,325 --> 00:18:42,761
- Whether it was the cast or crew...
- Inspector Callahan.

179
00:18:43,229 --> 00:18:44,856
Inspector.

180
00:18:45,064 --> 00:18:46,497
Shit.

181
00:18:46,866 --> 00:18:49,391
Is it true that Johnny Squares OD'd?

182
00:18:49,602 --> 00:18:52,127
We're conducting an investigation.

183
00:18:52,338 --> 00:18:55,432
Right as we speak.
At this point, nothing's been...

184
00:18:55,641 --> 00:18:57,802
Thank you, inspector.

185
00:19:01,447 --> 00:19:03,574
Excuse me, are you Suzanne Dayton?

186
00:19:03,783 --> 00:19:05,114
What's going on here?

187
00:19:05,318 --> 00:19:06,649
Johnny?

188
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:08,384
Johnny?

189
00:19:08,855 --> 00:19:11,016
Hold it. I'm sorry,
you have to step back.

190
00:19:11,224 --> 00:19:13,488
- No, Johnny!
- There's nothing they can do.

191
00:19:17,597 --> 00:19:19,531
You're gonna make yourself sick.

192
00:19:19,732 --> 00:19:22,667
Hold on, could we
give her a little air?

193
00:19:23,636 --> 00:19:25,035
Out of the way, please.

194
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,777
Off with that camera.

195
00:19:32,979 --> 00:19:35,379
I can film whatever I want.
IKKeep shooting.

196
00:19:35,615 --> 00:19:37,480
This is someone else's heartache.

197
00:19:37,683 --> 00:19:39,150
Right in here.

198
00:19:39,352 --> 00:19:41,877
What are you doing? Give me that.

199
00:19:51,531 --> 00:19:53,021
Smart.

200
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:01,598
High and Dry <i>is the kind of</i>
<i>mindless film comedy...</i>

201
00:21:01,801 --> 00:21:06,135
<i>... that's come to typify summer films</i>
<i>aimed at the youth market.</i>

202
00:21:06,339 --> 00:21:09,740
<i>The humor is of the</i>
<i>locker-room variety.</i>

203
00:21:09,942 --> 00:21:14,106
<i>Audiences seeking more sophistication</i>
<i>will have to look elsewhere.</i>

204
00:21:14,313 --> 00:21:15,405
<i>The producers...</i>

205
00:21:15,715 --> 00:21:19,242
<i>Rock star Johnny Squares</i>
<i>was found dead this afternoon.</i>

206
00:21:19,452 --> 00:21:22,012
<i>Samantha Walker filed this report.</i>

207
00:21:23,189 --> 00:21:27,592
<i>The body of Johnny Squares was found</i>
<i>today at the Royal Meat Company...</i>

208
00:21:27,793 --> 00:21:30,762
<i>... where he was on location</i>
<i>filming</i> Hotel Satan.

209
00:21:30,963 --> 00:21:36,026
<i>The cause of death is not known,</i>
<i>but Squares had a history of drug use.</i>

210
00:21:36,235 --> 00:21:39,830
<i>The rock star was arrested last July</i>
<i>for possession of heroin.</i>

211
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:43,805
<i>Many of his songs were allegedly</i>
<i>based on his drug experience.</i>

212
00:22:06,899 --> 00:22:08,389
What's that all about?

213
00:22:08,601 --> 00:22:10,626
My past catching up with me.

214
00:22:10,836 --> 00:22:15,000
As a kid, I was in the gang
that hit him up for protection money.

215
00:22:15,408 --> 00:22:19,242
All my life, I've been running in
gangs or trying to put them away.

216
00:22:19,445 --> 00:22:23,848
So I figured I'd come over to Homicide
for something different.

217
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:26,018
It's different, all right.

218
00:22:30,089 --> 00:22:31,351
Call for backup.

219
00:22:38,831 --> 00:22:41,459
Come on, get the fuck out of here.
Hurry up!

220
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,672
Move it! Move it!

221
00:22:55,881 --> 00:22:58,315
Put your money on the table!
Hurry up!

222
00:22:58,517 --> 00:22:59,677
Don't move!

223
00:22:59,885 --> 00:23:01,785
Don't fuck with me, lady!

224
00:23:02,154 --> 00:23:03,781
Come on, guys, hurry up!

225
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:06,151
- You forgot your fortune cookie.
- What!?

226
00:23:14,633 --> 00:23:15,531
It says:

227
00:23:17,136 --> 00:23:18,569
"You're shit out of luck."

228
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,349
Get out of the way!

229
00:24:12,224 --> 00:24:16,661
"Teaming up with a Chinese-American is
good for the department's image."

230
00:24:34,447 --> 00:24:35,471
Who was he?

231
00:24:35,681 --> 00:24:38,479
Some guy in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

232
00:24:38,684 --> 00:24:40,982
Madison. Dean Madison was his name.

233
00:24:41,187 --> 00:24:42,552
Does it ring a bell?

234
00:24:43,389 --> 00:24:46,552
- Never heard of him.
- Well, he knew you, Harry.

235
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:49,990
I found this in his pocket.
It's a list of celebrities.

236
00:24:50,596 --> 00:24:54,589
Tony Engelhart, the pro linebacker.
Michael Cipriano, the race car driver.

237
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,236
Oh, and one Inspector Harry Callahan.

238
00:24:59,738 --> 00:25:03,731
Johnny Squares is on that list.
See what's written by his name?

239
00:25:04,743 --> 00:25:08,338
Yeah, RIP. "Rest in peace."

240
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,315
You know what this is?

241
00:25:12,518 --> 00:25:14,816
It's a bill for a TV camera and lens.

242
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:19,081
When I said stop wrecking cars,
I didn't mean destroy something else.

243
00:25:19,291 --> 00:25:21,851
They interfered
with an investigation, sir.

244
00:25:22,061 --> 00:25:25,792
Don't give us that. Is this
your idea of media cooperation?

245
00:25:25,998 --> 00:25:28,193
Cooperation works two ways.

246
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,891
What is it you have against reporters?

247
00:25:31,103 --> 00:25:33,537
Some of them
are just marvelous people.

248
00:25:33,739 --> 00:25:37,732
Others walk through a pile and track
it through an investigation.

249
00:25:37,943 --> 00:25:40,104
You better change
your attitude fast.

250
00:25:40,312 --> 00:25:43,247
Because unless we
reach an agreement with them...

251
00:25:43,449 --> 00:25:47,044
...it's liable to cost this city
2 million, and your career.

252
00:25:49,221 --> 00:25:50,552
Join us, please.

253
00:25:50,756 --> 00:25:53,418
This is Ms. Samantha Walker
of station IKKWSF.

254
00:25:53,626 --> 00:25:54,524
Captain Donnelly.

255
00:25:54,727 --> 00:25:57,958
- Ms. Walker.
- Captain.

256
00:25:58,164 --> 00:26:00,997
- And this is Inspector...
- Callahan. We've met.

257
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,499
Yes, of course. Won't you sit down?

258
00:26:06,572 --> 00:26:07,561
Ms. Walker...

259
00:26:07,773 --> 00:26:11,869
...Lieutenant Ackerman tells me
you have a proposal to make...

260
00:26:12,077 --> 00:26:14,545
...regarding the accidental
damage to...

261
00:26:14,747 --> 00:26:17,409
There was nothing accidental about it.

262
00:26:19,351 --> 00:26:22,218
The department might have something
to say about that.

263
00:26:22,421 --> 00:26:24,889
Although the camera was destroyed...

264
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:27,957
...I have the entire
incident on video.

265
00:26:29,495 --> 00:26:30,894
I see.

266
00:26:34,133 --> 00:26:35,293
And your proposal?

267
00:26:36,535 --> 00:26:40,164
We may be willing to drop
the lawsuit against the city...

268
00:26:40,372 --> 00:26:42,863
...but that depends
on Inspector Callahan.

269
00:26:44,843 --> 00:26:47,505
I'm sure the inspector
would be willing to...

270
00:26:47,713 --> 00:26:49,203
What do you have in mind?

271
00:26:51,784 --> 00:26:52,773
Dinner.

272
00:27:09,535 --> 00:27:11,901
I owe you an apology.

273
00:27:12,204 --> 00:27:14,638
You were right
about what I did the other day.

274
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,332
I had no business intruding
on that girl's grief.

275
00:27:20,246 --> 00:27:21,804
I get too eager sometimes.

276
00:27:22,014 --> 00:27:25,108
In my rush to get the story,
I made an error in judgement.

277
00:27:25,317 --> 00:27:27,148
We all make those sometimes.

278
00:27:27,353 --> 00:27:29,821
No, I should have known better.

279
00:27:30,022 --> 00:27:31,580
I'm sorry.

280
00:27:32,691 --> 00:27:35,251
- Let me ask you, Miss Walker...
- Sam.

281
00:27:35,527 --> 00:27:36,619
Sam.

282
00:27:36,829 --> 00:27:37,853
Do you like cops?

283
00:27:38,931 --> 00:27:41,365
If they're not in my
rear-view mirror. Why?

284
00:27:43,135 --> 00:27:45,399
I wonder what
we're supposed to talk about...

285
00:27:45,604 --> 00:27:47,970
...other than the damaged camera.

286
00:27:48,173 --> 00:27:49,970
Oh, no, no, no.

287
00:27:50,175 --> 00:27:53,440
I'm letting the insurance company
deal with that.

288
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:58,380
And I think I can be persuaded
to drop the lawsuit...

289
00:27:58,584 --> 00:28:00,484
...but I want something in return.

290
00:28:02,955 --> 00:28:04,047
What would that be?

291
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:05,618
I want your story.

292
00:28:10,195 --> 00:28:11,025
What's that?

293
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,664
I've done my homework on you.

294
00:28:13,866 --> 00:28:16,300
You've had quite a colorful career.

295
00:28:16,502 --> 00:28:18,197
Loot at this. You see...

296
00:28:18,404 --> 00:28:22,602
...there's a lot of interest right now
in the Janero case...

297
00:28:22,808 --> 00:28:24,673
...and the cop who put him in prison.

298
00:28:24,877 --> 00:28:29,246
Channel 8 is doing a news special
on organized crime in the Bay Area.

299
00:28:29,448 --> 00:28:33,578
But what I would like to do
is an in-depth profile...

300
00:28:33,786 --> 00:28:36,687
...of you, Inspector Harry Callahan.

301
00:28:36,889 --> 00:28:38,481
Sorry, I'm not interested.

302
00:28:38,691 --> 00:28:42,821
Why not? This latest attempt
on your life by one of Janero's men...

303
00:28:43,028 --> 00:28:45,929
You're not interested
in doing a story on me.

304
00:28:46,131 --> 00:28:48,099
You want blood. That's what sells...

305
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,167
- Now wait a minute...
- No, you wait a minute.

306
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:53,930
You people are interested
in death and mayhem...

307
00:28:54,139 --> 00:28:56,369
...and you don't care
how you get the story.

308
00:28:56,575 --> 00:29:00,909
That is not fair. That's not
the kind of journalism I do.

309
00:29:01,113 --> 00:29:03,741
To you I'm just a cop
with a price on his head.

310
00:29:03,949 --> 00:29:07,942
Let me tell you, I don't like
people saying they're gonna kill me.

311
00:29:08,153 --> 00:29:11,680
Nor do I like journalists using it
as a way to increase ratings.

312
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:15,792
- What I was going to say...
- That's the end of the story.

313
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:33,102
Sorry.

314
00:29:35,848 --> 00:29:38,146
The coroner's report last night...

315
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:40,743
...said that Squares used speedballs.

316
00:29:40,953 --> 00:29:42,614
Injecting cocaine and heroin?

317
00:29:42,821 --> 00:29:44,345
But that's not what killed him.

318
00:29:44,556 --> 00:29:47,719
He was using an inhaler
with some new designer drug.

319
00:29:47,926 --> 00:29:50,019
A synthetic form of heroin.

320
00:29:50,229 --> 00:29:52,993
You mean something along the lines
of China White.

321
00:29:53,198 --> 00:29:55,996
Only a thousand times wore powerful.

322
00:29:56,201 --> 00:29:59,432
One snort and he went into
immediate respiratory failure.

323
00:29:59,638 --> 00:30:01,333
IKKnow what I'm trying to figure?

324
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,201
Why is a guy like that...

325
00:30:03,409 --> 00:30:07,209
...screwing with synthetic junk
when he's got the real stuff?

326
00:30:07,413 --> 00:30:09,574
Maybe he didn't know
what he was using.

327
00:30:14,987 --> 00:30:16,147
Harry.

328
00:30:21,126 --> 00:30:21,956
Harry?

329
00:30:24,563 --> 00:30:26,224
Sorry about that.

330
00:30:29,535 --> 00:30:31,162
Get you next time.

331
00:30:37,709 --> 00:30:40,837
Check the cast and crew
for prior drug busts.

332
00:30:41,046 --> 00:30:45,813
I'll check with Narcotics to see if any
dealers are moving synthetic heroin.

333
00:30:46,118 --> 00:30:48,382
Harry, there's something here
you should see.

334
00:30:49,087 --> 00:30:52,056
<i>A story to be published</i>
<i>in today's</i> Tribune...

335
00:30:52,257 --> 00:30:56,387
<i>... reveals that director Peter Swan</i>
<i>and several other people involved...</i>

336
00:30:56,595 --> 00:31:01,464
<i>... in the film</i> Hotel Satan <i>were</i>
<i>playing a game called "The Dead Pool."</i>

337
00:31:01,667 --> 00:31:04,192
<i>According to sources,</i>
<i>the object of the game...</i>

338
00:31:04,403 --> 00:31:07,304
<i>... was for players to pick</i>
<i>eight Bay Area celebrities...</i>

339
00:31:07,506 --> 00:31:11,169
<i>... who might die</i>
<i>by a predetermined date.</i>

340
00:31:11,376 --> 00:31:16,177
<i>The winner was to possess the list</i>
<i>with the most dead celebrities.</i>

341
00:31:16,381 --> 00:31:18,508
<i>What makes this story significant...</i>

342
00:31:18,717 --> 00:31:23,711
<i>... is that rock star Johnny Squares</i>
<i>was on director Peter Swan's list.</i>

343
00:31:23,922 --> 00:31:26,720
<i>Although Swan would not comment...</i>

344
00:31:26,925 --> 00:31:30,258
<i>... we have confirmed that</i>
<i>there was such a game...</i>

345
00:31:30,462 --> 00:31:35,024
<i>... and Swan's production accountant,</i>
<i>Dean Madison, was also involved.</i>

346
00:31:35,267 --> 00:31:37,827
<i>Ironically, Madison was</i>
<i>killed yesterday...</i>

347
00:31:38,036 --> 00:31:41,528
<i>... in a tragic holdup attempt</i>
<i>that took place in Chinatown.</i>

348
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:48,910
"There is no man who is master of the
breath of life so as to retain it...

349
00:31:49,114 --> 00:31:52,106
...and none has mastery
over the day of death.

350
00:31:52,317 --> 00:31:55,150
For the Lord of all
shows no partiality...

351
00:31:55,354 --> 00:31:56,912
...nor does He fear greatness...

352
00:31:57,122 --> 00:31:58,987
...because He himself
made the great...

353
00:31:59,191 --> 00:32:00,715
...as well as the small.

354
00:32:00,926 --> 00:32:03,724
And He provides for all alike.

355
00:32:04,496 --> 00:32:08,057
And the dust returns to the
earth, as it once was.

356
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:12,095
And the life breath
returns to God, who gaveth."

357
00:32:19,478 --> 00:32:21,207
My condolences.

358
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,440
Mrs. Dayton, I'm terribly sorry.

359
00:32:24,683 --> 00:32:27,675
Suzanne, I'm very sorry
for your trouble.

360
00:32:27,886 --> 00:32:29,183
Thank you.

361
00:32:30,989 --> 00:32:32,479
My sympathies, dear.

362
00:32:35,027 --> 00:32:38,656
Do you mind, gentlemen?
I happen to be at a funeral.

363
00:32:38,897 --> 00:32:40,831
I'd like to talk about your list.

364
00:32:41,033 --> 00:32:44,491
It's no big secret.
The cast and crew knew about it.

365
00:32:44,703 --> 00:32:47,900
The Dead Pool is just a harmless game.

366
00:32:48,106 --> 00:32:50,472
It sounds pretty sick to me.

367
00:32:51,043 --> 00:32:52,533
Let me tell you something.

368
00:32:52,911 --> 00:32:55,846
People are fascinated
with death and violence.

369
00:32:56,048 --> 00:32:57,948
That's why my films make money.

370
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:01,449
They're an escape,
a vicarious release of fear.

371
00:33:01,653 --> 00:33:03,484
Same thing with this game.

372
00:33:03,689 --> 00:33:06,385
Nobody takes my films
or the Dead Pool seriously.

373
00:33:07,092 --> 00:33:10,619
Someone gave Squares the drugs
that killed him. Maybe you.

374
00:33:10,829 --> 00:33:14,287
You can't tie me to Johnny's death
because of a coincidence.

375
00:33:15,734 --> 00:33:20,000
My assistant and effects supervisor
played too. Why not talk to them?

376
00:33:20,205 --> 00:33:21,172
We will.

377
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,233
But nobody on their list is dead yet.

378
00:33:24,443 --> 00:33:28,937
Johnny was a drug user and I predicted
he'd die this year. That's all.

379
00:33:29,147 --> 00:33:32,241
The idea is to pick celebrities
who won't make it...

380
00:33:32,451 --> 00:33:35,477
...because they're old, sick
or in a high-risk profession.

381
00:33:35,687 --> 00:33:37,177
Like police work?

382
00:33:37,656 --> 00:33:38,623
Nothing personal.

383
00:33:38,824 --> 00:33:41,384
I don't like being on your list, Swan.

384
00:33:41,593 --> 00:33:44,323
That's what this is really about,
isn't it?

385
00:33:44,529 --> 00:33:45,689
If you have a choice...

386
00:33:45,897 --> 00:33:48,593
Maybe I'll start my own Pool
and put you on it.

387
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,233
Are you threatening me?

388
00:33:50,869 --> 00:33:55,272
If you want to play the game,
you'd better know the rules, love.

389
00:34:14,059 --> 00:34:16,186
That's our report. I'm Patrick Snow.

390
00:34:16,395 --> 00:34:19,262
I'm Samantha Walker.
Thank you for being with us.

391
00:34:19,464 --> 00:34:21,432
Tune in tonight
for an exclusive report...

392
00:34:21,633 --> 00:34:24,033
...on chemical dependency
among celebrities.

393
00:34:24,236 --> 00:34:25,863
Who they are, why they do it...

394
00:34:26,071 --> 00:34:28,699
...and the price they pay.
Tonight at 11.

395
00:34:28,907 --> 00:34:30,204
Good night.

396
00:34:31,143 --> 00:34:32,770
And we're clear.

397
00:34:51,596 --> 00:34:53,860
Thought I'd seen the last of you.

398
00:34:54,066 --> 00:34:55,590
I saw your report yesterday.

399
00:34:55,801 --> 00:34:57,928
We confirmed it
with people in the game.

400
00:34:58,136 --> 00:35:02,903
Vicky Owens, Swan's assistant,
and effects supervisor, Jeff Howser.

401
00:35:03,241 --> 00:35:06,074
It didn't occur to you
to clear it with us first?

402
00:35:06,278 --> 00:35:07,836
I had to go with the story.

403
00:35:08,046 --> 00:35:11,573
The papers got the same tip.
I had to get the story out fast.

404
00:35:11,783 --> 00:35:13,978
Or someone else would get it first?

405
00:35:14,186 --> 00:35:16,416
- Something like that.
- How were you tipped?

406
00:35:16,621 --> 00:35:20,580
By mail. A copy of the Dead Pool
and a letter explaining it.

407
00:35:23,161 --> 00:35:25,493
- It's already started.
- What has?

408
00:35:25,697 --> 00:35:27,722
All the media bullshit.

409
00:35:27,966 --> 00:35:31,993
Newspapers print the Dead Pool
and it hurts our investigation.

410
00:35:32,204 --> 00:35:33,762
What bothers you...

411
00:35:33,972 --> 00:35:36,702
...is that we found out about
the Dead Pool first.

412
00:35:36,908 --> 00:35:41,277
You people take Janero and the Dead
Pool, add hype and distortion...

413
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,107
...and innocent people get hurt.

414
00:35:43,315 --> 00:35:45,283
Aren't you overreacting?

415
00:35:45,484 --> 00:35:46,917
I've seen it happen.

416
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,952
I don't like the hype, either...

417
00:35:50,155 --> 00:35:52,487
...but it happens when reporters
compete for a story.

418
00:35:52,858 --> 00:35:56,851
Why don't you start thinking about
your responsibility to the public?

419
00:35:58,363 --> 00:36:01,298
You can't kill the messenger
because of the message.

420
00:36:02,868 --> 00:36:07,202
I'm sorry, it wasn't my intention
to screw up your investigation.

421
00:36:08,106 --> 00:36:10,370
Here's the list. Now, excuse me.

422
00:36:12,911 --> 00:36:14,105
Thanks.

423
00:36:17,883 --> 00:36:19,407
It seems I owe you one.

424
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,910
Dinner, that is.

425
00:36:27,092 --> 00:36:31,859
I was offered a job as an anchor
at this small, local station.

426
00:36:32,063 --> 00:36:33,496
Because...

427
00:36:33,765 --> 00:36:36,962
...I was first runner-up
in Miss Colorado.

428
00:36:37,169 --> 00:36:39,763
Colorado? We're right over here.

429
00:36:39,971 --> 00:36:44,374
But I had absolutely no experience,
just my bachelor's in journalism.

430
00:36:44,576 --> 00:36:48,444
But it was a way in, so I grabbed it.

431
00:36:51,583 --> 00:36:54,552
But I didn't just smile at
the camera and read copy.

432
00:36:54,753 --> 00:36:57,381
I did anything and everything
at this station.

433
00:36:57,589 --> 00:37:01,650
Sports, news, hard news, weather.

434
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,794
I produced documentaries.

435
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,564
I love San Francisco.

436
00:37:07,766 --> 00:37:09,393
But it isn't easy.

437
00:37:10,769 --> 00:37:12,930
Big city, big news.

438
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:16,205
I had to prove myself all over again.

439
00:37:16,408 --> 00:37:18,069
Have you succeeded?

440
00:37:18,443 --> 00:37:19,671
Somewhat.

441
00:37:21,012 --> 00:37:22,445
Apparently not with you.

442
00:37:23,715 --> 00:37:28,084
I shouldn't complain. At least you
stayed for dinner this time.

443
00:37:29,888 --> 00:37:32,049
I'd still love to do your story.

444
00:37:32,624 --> 00:37:33,886
No, thanks.

445
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:37,458
You're wrong about me, Callahan,
and what I want to do.

446
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:40,164
I wish I could convince you.

447
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:41,998
I'll tell you what.

448
00:37:42,601 --> 00:37:44,228
Let's think on it.

449
00:37:45,337 --> 00:37:46,235
Sounds fair.

450
00:37:48,974 --> 00:37:50,202
Thank you.

451
00:38:04,823 --> 00:38:08,088
It's the truth,
I don't care what you say.

452
00:38:15,066 --> 00:38:16,693
Hey, Callahan.

453
00:38:17,068 --> 00:38:19,628
- You're Callahan, aren't you?
- That's right.

454
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:20,930
What can I do for you?

455
00:38:21,139 --> 00:38:23,539
You're the cop who put Janero away.

456
00:38:26,578 --> 00:38:29,138
All I want is your autograph.

457
00:38:30,916 --> 00:38:32,747
Can I shake your hand?

458
00:38:36,354 --> 00:38:37,821
I'd just like to thank you.

459
00:38:38,023 --> 00:38:41,322
It's about time somebody
did something about Janero.

460
00:38:41,526 --> 00:38:45,292
Could you sign it to
Chester Docksteder? That's me.

461
00:38:46,398 --> 00:38:47,797
Let me buy you a drink.

462
00:38:47,999 --> 00:38:49,466
Some other time.

463
00:38:50,068 --> 00:38:53,731
We need more cops like you.
That's what we need.

464
00:38:54,339 --> 00:38:56,500
I gotta change my shorts.

465
00:39:00,245 --> 00:39:01,974
What are you laughing at?

466
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:04,910
This is your 15 minutes, Callahan.

467
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:09,910
Andy Warhol said everybody's famous
for 15 minutes. Well, this is it.

468
00:39:10,121 --> 00:39:11,145
Swell.

469
00:39:27,005 --> 00:39:28,529
Was it your first autograph?

470
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,900
Yeah.

471
00:39:30,175 --> 00:39:32,336
And I hope my last.

472
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:00,859
You know something?

473
00:41:01,132 --> 00:41:04,067
I don't think Lou Janero
likes you very much.

474
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:18,710
She's okay. Just a little shaken up.

475
00:41:24,889 --> 00:41:26,550
How're you doing, girl?

476
00:41:30,261 --> 00:41:34,027
Whatever they're paying you, Harry,
it couldn't be enough.

477
00:41:38,603 --> 00:41:40,127
My colleagues.

478
00:41:45,243 --> 00:41:47,143
I don't want to be the news.

479
00:41:48,813 --> 00:41:50,405
Let's get you out of here.

480
00:42:23,548 --> 00:42:25,516
You sure you want to see this guy?

481
00:42:25,717 --> 00:42:26,979
Yeah.

482
00:42:37,762 --> 00:42:39,059
Here's your animal.

483
00:42:39,597 --> 00:42:40,427
Hicks.

484
00:42:40,632 --> 00:42:42,259
What the fuck do you want?

485
00:42:42,467 --> 00:42:44,526
I brought you some cigarettes.

486
00:42:45,136 --> 00:42:47,366
And what would I have to do for you?

487
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:50,608
Nothing. Just stand where I tell you.

488
00:43:17,168 --> 00:43:18,499
Stay right here.

489
00:43:18,703 --> 00:43:20,170
Fifth cell down.

490
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,273
That's the trouble with this prison.
They let anybody in.

491
00:43:33,718 --> 00:43:36,778
I don't like scum like you
trying to kill me.

492
00:43:38,056 --> 00:43:42,891
Sounds to me like this Dead Pool thing
is making you a little paranoid.

493
00:43:44,462 --> 00:43:47,158
Oh, yeah. I heard about it.

494
00:43:47,398 --> 00:43:50,060
Good news travels fast.

495
00:43:50,268 --> 00:43:52,634
Big fucking media hero.

496
00:43:52,837 --> 00:43:55,362
Hero today and gone tomorrow.

497
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,608
Call off your guns.

498
00:43:57,842 --> 00:43:59,503
What are you talking about?

499
00:43:59,711 --> 00:44:03,738
Your trouble is, you have
too much time on your hands.

500
00:44:03,948 --> 00:44:05,438
What you need is a job.

501
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:06,480
A what?

502
00:44:06,684 --> 00:44:07,981
A job.

503
00:44:08,486 --> 00:44:11,819
I'm gonna give you a job
being a postman, understand?

504
00:44:12,023 --> 00:44:14,685
It'll be your job to see
the mail gets through.

505
00:44:15,727 --> 00:44:17,854
See that gorilla down there?

506
00:44:26,537 --> 00:44:30,667
That's Butcher Hicks, and he's killed
three men. You know how?

507
00:44:30,875 --> 00:44:34,333
He tore them apart with his teeth.
Never found all the pieces.

508
00:44:34,545 --> 00:44:36,809
He has an unhealthy appetite.

509
00:44:37,015 --> 00:44:38,209
So what?

510
00:44:38,416 --> 00:44:41,010
So Hicks there is my new pen pal.

511
00:44:41,219 --> 00:44:43,278
I'll write him once a week...

512
00:44:43,488 --> 00:44:46,355
...about how I'm looking in
on his sick mother...

513
00:44:46,557 --> 00:44:49,549
...and trying to get him
special privileges here.

514
00:44:49,894 --> 00:44:54,524
And the interesting part is,
if anything happens to me...

515
00:44:54,732 --> 00:44:56,461
...and Hicks doesn't get his letter...

516
00:44:56,668 --> 00:44:59,728
...he'll be really pissed off.
And he'll come to see you...

517
00:44:59,937 --> 00:45:01,234
...because you're the mailman.

518
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:07,743
He'll probably come down here
and cancel your ass like a stamp.

519
00:45:10,448 --> 00:45:13,383
You better ensure prompt,
courteous delivery.

520
00:45:13,584 --> 00:45:16,610
And pray nothing happens to me.

521
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:23,088
- That's it?
- That's it.

522
00:45:23,294 --> 00:45:26,422
See that dirtbag
I was talking to down there?

523
00:45:29,033 --> 00:45:31,058
He says smoking can cause cancer...

524
00:45:31,269 --> 00:45:35,638
...and anyone who smokes as much
as you do is one dumb son of a bitch.

525
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,157
Fire!

526
00:45:58,963 --> 00:45:59,861
Cut!

527
00:46:00,064 --> 00:46:02,498
Cut! Cut.

528
00:46:04,168 --> 00:46:06,568
Where is that stupid fuck? Hauser!

529
00:46:07,739 --> 00:46:09,604
Get your ass down here.

530
00:46:11,976 --> 00:46:15,309
You're supposed to harpoon
the goddamn dummy.

531
00:46:16,581 --> 00:46:17,707
The tide shifted.

532
00:46:17,915 --> 00:46:21,510
"The tide shifted."
The ocean's incompetent, not you.

533
00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:23,846
This is the third time this week.

534
00:46:24,055 --> 00:46:26,046
You'll never work for me again.

535
00:46:26,257 --> 00:46:28,691
There's a bunch
of reporters down there.

536
00:46:31,662 --> 00:46:33,186
Come on, come on.

537
00:46:38,603 --> 00:46:40,298
Can we ask you a few questions?

538
00:46:40,505 --> 00:46:41,836
Please!

539
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:43,870
I'd like to say one thing.

540
00:46:44,075 --> 00:46:45,975
In light of what's happened...

541
00:46:46,177 --> 00:46:48,975
...perhaps playing the Dead Pool game
isn't smart.

542
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:51,944
Any tie between the Dead Pool
and Squares' death?

543
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:54,550
None whatsoever. Next question.

544
00:46:54,752 --> 00:46:56,811
Mr. Swan, will the game continue?

545
00:46:57,021 --> 00:47:00,718
No, we're filming a nightmare
sequence at the shipyards...

546
00:47:00,925 --> 00:47:04,088
...and we'd like to forget this
and get on with our job.

547
00:47:04,395 --> 00:47:06,363
Johnny would have wanted it that way.

548
00:47:06,564 --> 00:47:11,433
First Squares died, then your
production accountant was killed.

549
00:47:11,636 --> 00:47:13,399
Is <i>Hotel Satan</i> cursed?

550
00:47:13,604 --> 00:47:16,767
People can believe what they want,
but nothing...

551
00:47:18,643 --> 00:47:21,544
Nothing will stop me
from making this film.

552
00:47:23,648 --> 00:47:25,081
End of interview.

553
00:48:09,393 --> 00:48:13,159
Whatever you want,
money, credit cards, just take it.

554
00:48:13,364 --> 00:48:16,390
Ever notice how time
slows down at night?

555
00:48:16,601 --> 00:48:20,264
Just like in my films. A dream world.

556
00:48:20,471 --> 00:48:21,597
Shut up!

557
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:24,774
I can't hear the colors.
I've got to hear them.

558
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:29,746
That's the mark of a good director,
you have to hear the colors.

559
00:48:29,947 --> 00:48:32,882
You've gotta be able
to taste the sounds.

560
00:48:33,084 --> 00:48:34,449
I have a heart condition.

561
00:48:34,652 --> 00:48:36,483
A critic with a heart.

562
00:48:36,787 --> 00:48:38,049
That's a laugh.

563
00:48:40,124 --> 00:48:41,716
Do you like my films?

564
00:48:41,926 --> 00:48:45,623
- I said, do you like my films?
- Who are you?

565
00:48:50,868 --> 00:48:54,235
- You know who I am.
- I don't. I don't know you.

566
00:48:54,438 --> 00:48:55,735
God...

567
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:59,109
...what kind of a film critic are you?

568
00:48:59,977 --> 00:49:01,842
<i>Shadows of the Dead</i>!

569
00:49:03,548 --> 00:49:05,277
<i>Hell Without the Devil</i>!

570
00:49:05,516 --> 00:49:07,541
<i>Night of the Slasher</i>!

571
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,350
Peter Swan.

572
00:49:12,757 --> 00:49:14,247
Brilliant, love.

573
00:49:15,426 --> 00:49:17,417
What do you think of my films?

574
00:49:17,995 --> 00:49:21,431
Give me your honest opinion.

575
00:49:22,567 --> 00:49:24,467
I like them.

576
00:49:24,669 --> 00:49:25,795
Liar!

577
00:49:35,046 --> 00:49:37,810
The entrance is probably
through the sliding glass door.

578
00:49:38,015 --> 00:49:40,040
She wasn't sexually assaulted.

579
00:49:40,251 --> 00:49:41,809
IKKilled sometime last night.

580
00:49:42,019 --> 00:49:45,045
Maid found her this morning.
Do you recognize her?

581
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:48,150
Molly Fisher. Famous movie critic.

582
00:49:48,359 --> 00:49:50,827
On a scale of 1 to 10,
10 being the best...

583
00:49:51,028 --> 00:49:53,292
...I'd have to rate this one an 8.

584
00:49:53,497 --> 00:49:55,465
Harry, we found this.

585
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,428
Thanks.

586
00:49:59,303 --> 00:50:00,463
Dead Pool.

587
00:50:00,738 --> 00:50:03,536
Molly Fisher's also
on Peter Swan's list.

588
00:50:41,045 --> 00:50:42,876
<i>Oh, God, it's coming!</i>

589
00:50:44,749 --> 00:50:49,049
Those are just some of the highlights
of Peter Swan's films.

590
00:50:50,154 --> 00:50:54,284
The typeface is the same as those sent
to the papers and TV stations.

591
00:50:54,492 --> 00:50:58,986
And the neighbor saw a man exiting
Molly Fisher's condo last night.

592
00:50:59,196 --> 00:51:01,721
Mid-30s, wearing a black jacket.

593
00:51:01,999 --> 00:51:03,864
I want Swan in custody now.

594
00:51:04,068 --> 00:51:05,467
It doesn't feel right.

595
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:06,864
Doesn't feel right?

596
00:51:07,371 --> 00:51:10,898
Every celebrity on this list has
called in the last couple days.

597
00:51:11,108 --> 00:51:13,668
They're all screaming
for police protection.

598
00:51:13,878 --> 00:51:17,939
We don't have the manpower
to be 24-hour babysitters.

599
00:51:18,149 --> 00:51:23,109
Ackerman is whining about the negative
publicity this case is giving us.

600
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:26,448
And your name
is on this list too, Callahan.

601
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:31,890
My gut feeling tells me Swan is the
best suspect we have...

602
00:51:32,096 --> 00:51:33,654
...so get his butt in here!

603
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,160
Donnelly.

604
00:51:37,468 --> 00:51:38,492
What?

605
00:51:40,204 --> 00:51:42,638
It's for you, Callahan.

606
00:51:47,878 --> 00:51:49,641
We'll be right there.

607
00:51:50,014 --> 00:51:52,642
Wait a minute. Where are you going?

608
00:51:52,917 --> 00:51:55,909
To do my job.
I think we've got our man.

609
00:51:58,422 --> 00:52:00,049
You all stay back.

610
00:52:00,925 --> 00:52:02,187
Everyone.

611
00:52:02,893 --> 00:52:03,985
I'm gonna go up.

612
00:52:05,329 --> 00:52:07,297
Where's the news crew?

613
00:52:09,366 --> 00:52:11,391
You better get them here.

614
00:52:13,037 --> 00:52:14,527
I mean it. Now!

615
00:52:20,678 --> 00:52:21,508
What's up?

616
00:52:21,712 --> 00:52:25,978
Name's Gus Wheeler.
He says he's the Dead Pool killer.

617
00:52:26,183 --> 00:52:27,844
We found him like this.

618
00:52:28,052 --> 00:52:31,954
He's soaked in gas and threatening
to set himself on fire.

619
00:52:32,156 --> 00:52:33,589
Why not hose him down?

620
00:52:33,791 --> 00:52:37,955
He says if he sees a fireman or even
a garden hose, he'll torch himself.

621
00:52:38,763 --> 00:52:39,627
What's he want?

622
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:41,491
To be on television.

623
00:52:41,832 --> 00:52:44,426
He wants a cameraman and a reporter.

624
00:52:44,635 --> 00:52:46,262
Al and I will just pose as...

625
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:49,303
It has to be someone he recognizes.

626
00:53:01,185 --> 00:53:03,710
Stay back. Stay back from me.

627
00:53:04,588 --> 00:53:06,385
It's gonna go up. You hear me?

628
00:53:07,024 --> 00:53:08,889
Better keep those people back.

629
00:53:10,461 --> 00:53:12,395
- You all right?
- Not really.

630
00:53:12,596 --> 00:53:15,360
Stop right there! That's far enough.

631
00:53:16,267 --> 00:53:18,428
I'm Samantha Walker from...

632
00:53:18,636 --> 00:53:21,332
- I know who you are!
- What do you want?

633
00:53:23,407 --> 00:53:24,499
Is that camera on?

634
00:53:27,178 --> 00:53:29,408
You want to know why I'm doing this?

635
00:53:31,582 --> 00:53:33,174
Because nobody cares.

636
00:53:33,384 --> 00:53:34,373
We care, Mr. Wheeler...

637
00:53:34,585 --> 00:53:37,748
No! Nobody ever paid
any attention to me before.

638
00:53:38,022 --> 00:53:41,458
In order to get attention,
you gotta do something.

639
00:53:42,726 --> 00:53:46,594
Well, I'm really gonna
do something this time!

640
00:53:47,064 --> 00:53:50,124
Did you have anything
to do with the deaths...

641
00:53:50,334 --> 00:53:52,529
...of Johnny Squares and Molly Fisher?

642
00:53:52,736 --> 00:53:55,296
No, I just said that so you'd listen!

643
00:53:58,108 --> 00:54:00,599
I want everyone to see this!

644
00:54:01,145 --> 00:54:03,545
I want everyone to remember me!

645
00:54:03,814 --> 00:54:06,408
And to remember what I did here!

646
00:54:13,524 --> 00:54:17,085
Oh, Jesus, Harry, he's
really gonna do it.

647
00:54:17,294 --> 00:54:21,663
That's right, lady. I'm really
gonna set myself on fire.

648
00:54:22,399 --> 00:54:24,663
And it's gonna be on the news...

649
00:54:25,069 --> 00:54:28,527
...and then finally everybody
will know about me.

650
00:54:28,739 --> 00:54:31,173
About me! Gus Wheeler!

651
00:54:33,777 --> 00:54:35,938
No one's going to see you die.

652
00:54:38,382 --> 00:54:39,212
What?

653
00:54:39,416 --> 00:54:42,146
I said, no one's gonna see you die.

654
00:54:42,519 --> 00:54:44,453
Not if we stop filming.

655
00:54:48,325 --> 00:54:51,021
You can talk to me
and tell me your story...

656
00:54:51,228 --> 00:54:53,128
...but we won't film your suicide.

657
00:54:59,737 --> 00:55:00,567
What are you doing?

658
00:55:00,838 --> 00:55:03,636
- Turn the camera back on!
- We're not gonna film it!

659
00:55:03,841 --> 00:55:06,275
- We're not.
- She's right.

660
00:55:06,477 --> 00:55:10,436
You can set yourself on fire
and we'll roast marshmallows.

661
00:55:10,648 --> 00:55:12,513
But you won't be on <i>News at 11.</i>

662
00:55:13,384 --> 00:55:15,443
You're ruining everything.

663
00:55:16,186 --> 00:55:17,551
Give me the flare.

664
00:55:17,788 --> 00:55:19,517
You've got plenty of coverage.

665
00:55:22,726 --> 00:55:23,784
You think so?

666
00:55:24,461 --> 00:55:25,450
Trust me.

667
00:55:34,204 --> 00:55:35,193
Okay.

668
00:55:51,255 --> 00:55:52,654
Harry, you okay?

669
00:55:54,358 --> 00:55:56,292
- You hurt?
- No, I'm fine.

670
00:56:00,764 --> 00:56:02,664
Get that gurney over here, quick!

671
00:56:05,736 --> 00:56:06,566
You all right?

672
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:09,136
Oh, God, Harry.

673
00:56:10,207 --> 00:56:13,540
This man sets himself on fire.

674
00:56:18,349 --> 00:56:19,373
And it's my fault.

675
00:56:19,583 --> 00:56:21,346
It was an accident.

676
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:25,349
Maybe if we'd have kept filming.

677
00:56:25,556 --> 00:56:27,683
That's exactly what he wanted.

678
00:56:28,726 --> 00:56:33,493
What you did took guts. Most people
would have gone for the exclusive.

679
00:56:39,703 --> 00:56:41,500
Reel three, George.

680
00:56:45,009 --> 00:56:46,442
Just a moment.

681
00:56:46,910 --> 00:56:50,346
What is this? Why the fuck
are you harassing me?

682
00:56:50,547 --> 00:56:52,674
I was at a party when
Fisher was killed.

683
00:56:52,883 --> 00:56:55,909
I was there until 2,
and I have witnesses.

684
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:57,610
We know that. We checked.

685
00:56:57,821 --> 00:57:03,020
Somebody's trying to make us think
that you killed Squares and Fisher.

686
00:57:04,962 --> 00:57:06,361
Any idea who it is?

687
00:57:06,563 --> 00:57:08,963
Are you kidding? It could be anyone.

688
00:57:09,566 --> 00:57:10,590
They all hate me.

689
00:57:10,801 --> 00:57:11,893
My former agent.

690
00:57:12,102 --> 00:57:15,435
My producers, my crew. The public.

691
00:57:15,639 --> 00:57:20,008
They envy my talent so much
they wish to destroy it.

692
00:57:22,579 --> 00:57:25,446
You don't believe me?
Talk to my secretary.

693
00:57:25,649 --> 00:57:29,710
She'll show you the letters I get.
Warnings, death threats...

694
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:33,014
I get so many,
I don't pay attention anymore.

695
00:57:33,524 --> 00:57:35,014
I'll check on it.

696
00:57:35,692 --> 00:57:37,159
Tell me...

697
00:57:37,628 --> 00:57:40,597
...anyone else have
a jacket like this?

698
00:57:40,798 --> 00:57:41,992
Most of my crew. Why?

699
00:57:42,199 --> 00:57:46,659
Maybe it was someone in your crew,
or who's worked for you in the past.

700
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:51,364
Whoever's doing these murders uses
your films and you as inspiration.

701
00:57:53,644 --> 00:57:57,444
<i>Welcome to the</i> Nolan IKKennard Show.
<i>Sex, violence, pornography:</i>

702
00:57:57,648 --> 00:58:02,017
<i>I say it's out of hand. It's time</i>
<i>we have guidelines for what we watch.</i>

703
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:07,986
<i>I don't want Big Brother out there</i>
<i>telling me what to read or watch.</i>

704
00:58:11,228 --> 00:58:12,195
<i>What's your opinion?</i>

705
00:58:12,396 --> 00:58:15,024
<i>Anybody can watch anything...</i>

706
00:58:15,232 --> 00:58:18,065
<i>... as long as it doesn't</i>
<i>hurt somebody else.</i>

707
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:22,065
<i>Take it easy.</i>

708
00:58:22,272 --> 00:58:24,206
<i>Give me a chance here.</i>

709
00:58:24,408 --> 00:58:26,842
<i>Who decides what's harmful?</i>

710
00:58:27,044 --> 00:58:29,308
<i>Isn't that what we're talking about?</i>

711
00:59:56,833 --> 01:00:00,894
First Johnny Squares, then Molly
Fisher, now Nolan IKKennard.

712
01:00:01,104 --> 01:00:05,598
- Like I said, celebrities always die...
- In threes, yeah.

713
01:00:06,843 --> 01:00:10,335
- At least the guy went out with a...
- A bang, I know.

714
01:00:12,883 --> 01:00:15,613
- What do you have, Russ?
- Hello, Harry.

715
01:00:15,819 --> 01:00:20,620
From the residue on the frags,
I'd say plastic. Probably C3 or 4.

716
01:00:20,824 --> 01:00:22,883
We'll do an analysis back at the lab.

717
01:00:23,093 --> 01:00:25,618
- Let me know the results.
- You got it.

718
01:00:32,236 --> 01:00:33,703
What's that?

719
01:00:33,904 --> 01:00:35,428
I don't know.

720
01:00:35,872 --> 01:00:38,568
It looks like the wheel from a toy.

721
01:00:46,116 --> 01:00:48,516
Have you been questioned about
Nolan IKKennard?

722
01:00:48,719 --> 01:00:51,085
Is his death connected
to the Dead Pool?

723
01:00:51,288 --> 01:00:53,449
- I don't know.
- Is his death due to your list?

724
01:00:53,657 --> 01:00:55,716
- I don't know.
- In <i>Hell Without the Devil...</i>

725
01:00:55,926 --> 01:00:57,018
...a character's poisoned.

726
01:00:57,227 --> 01:00:59,923
<i>Night of the Slasher</i>
has several stabbings.

727
01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:02,928
- We can guess what <i>Hotel Satan</i>...
- Get to the point.

728
01:01:03,133 --> 01:01:06,432
Are there parallels between the deaths
in your film...

729
01:01:06,637 --> 01:01:08,502
...and the death of Johnny Squares?

730
01:01:08,705 --> 01:01:10,673
That's a stupid question!

731
01:01:10,874 --> 01:01:12,808
Do you feel any responsibility?

732
01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:15,604
You people are
blowing this out of proportion.

733
01:01:15,812 --> 01:01:19,145
<i>You want to speak to somebody?</i>
<i>Speak to the police.</i>

734
01:01:19,349 --> 01:01:23,513
<i>Talk to Inspector Callahan.</i>
<i>He'll tell you I'm not a suspect.</i>

735
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,847
<i>I have nothing</i>
<i>to do with these deaths.</i>

736
01:01:26,056 --> 01:01:28,422
<i>That's all I have to say, now sod off.</i>

737
01:01:28,825 --> 01:01:30,486
Callahan!

738
01:02:07,097 --> 01:02:08,564
You.

739
01:02:43,133 --> 01:02:44,259
Harry.

740
01:02:47,037 --> 01:02:49,232
I think that's about it for me.

741
01:02:53,143 --> 01:02:54,405
What's that tattoo?

742
01:02:55,078 --> 01:02:56,705
Oh, that.

743
01:02:56,913 --> 01:02:59,211
One of my grandfather's superstitions.

744
01:02:59,416 --> 01:03:03,079
You see, he painted these words
on my back and chest.

745
01:03:03,286 --> 01:03:06,915
It's supposed to ward off
anything that's harmful or evil.

746
01:03:07,124 --> 01:03:11,458
When he heard I was your partner,
he figured I could use the help.

747
01:03:11,661 --> 01:03:13,891
I was just trying
to honor the old guy.

748
01:03:14,631 --> 01:03:17,429
Besides, I didn't think it could hurt.

749
01:03:18,168 --> 01:03:20,636
Listen, I think I'm gonna go home.

750
01:03:20,837 --> 01:03:23,203
I'll catch you later for a beer.

751
01:03:59,976 --> 01:04:01,876
- See him?
- I saw him.

752
01:04:40,517 --> 01:04:42,075
He can't be over there.

753
01:04:42,652 --> 01:04:44,176
How y'all doing?

754
01:05:00,437 --> 01:05:02,530
You're the last asshole Janero sends.

755
01:05:02,739 --> 01:05:04,070
Wait, you got it wrong!

756
01:05:04,274 --> 01:05:07,607
Don't fuck with me, buddy.
I'll kick your ass right now.

757
01:05:07,811 --> 01:05:09,039
It's not what you think.

758
01:05:09,246 --> 01:05:11,214
Janero did hire us.

759
01:05:11,414 --> 01:05:13,279
But this ain't a hit.

760
01:05:13,483 --> 01:05:17,146
Janero doesn't want
anything to happen to you.

761
01:05:17,354 --> 01:05:18,286
We're your...

762
01:05:19,189 --> 01:05:20,281
...bodyguards.

763
01:05:31,101 --> 01:05:33,865
Those letters
all came from your files.

764
01:05:34,271 --> 01:05:36,796
Harlan Rook. God.

765
01:05:37,007 --> 01:05:38,372
Yes, I remember him.

766
01:05:38,575 --> 01:05:43,069
Every time I was at a film festival
or a seminar, he was there.

767
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:47,512
Mr. IKKnow-It-AII, I called him.
He knew everything about my films.

768
01:05:49,019 --> 01:05:52,455
To tell the truth,
I found it a little unnerving.

769
01:05:53,323 --> 01:05:54,813
What'd he want?

770
01:05:55,625 --> 01:05:56,922
He had this screenplay...

771
01:05:57,127 --> 01:05:59,322
...for a horror film
he wanted me to direct.

772
01:05:59,529 --> 01:06:02,225
He said it'd be
the ultimate Peter Swan film.

773
01:06:02,432 --> 01:06:04,400
He was crazy.
I couldn't get rid of him.

774
01:06:04,601 --> 01:06:08,093
Finally, my attorney
put a restraining order on him.

775
01:06:08,305 --> 01:06:09,499
Then what happened?

776
01:06:09,706 --> 01:06:11,799
I didn't see or hear from him again.

777
01:06:12,008 --> 01:06:14,875
That must have been over a year ago.

778
01:06:16,313 --> 01:06:17,280
Is he the one?

779
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:19,710
The typewriter
used on these letters...

780
01:06:19,916 --> 01:06:23,443
...is the same one used
to tip us off to the Dead Pool.

781
01:06:28,058 --> 01:06:31,357
Call Swan's attorney
and see what he knows about Rook.

782
01:06:31,561 --> 01:06:33,358
And run a DMV check.

783
01:06:33,563 --> 01:06:34,689
Right.

784
01:07:02,492 --> 01:07:06,758
It might not be a bad idea to start
playing it a little safe.

785
01:07:06,963 --> 01:07:09,158
Maybe your granddaddy can paint me up.

786
01:07:09,366 --> 01:07:11,231
Look, I'm being serious.

787
01:07:11,434 --> 01:07:15,370
Don't go where you normally go,
not even home. You can stay with me.

788
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:19,002
Thanks, but I think I can
do a little better.

789
01:07:29,886 --> 01:07:31,410
Price of fame.

790
01:08:01,651 --> 01:08:05,178
Is this what Ackerman meant
by cooperating with the press?

791
01:08:05,388 --> 01:08:08,789
It must have been one of those
in-depth interviews.

792
01:08:19,703 --> 01:08:22,866
I got a lead on Rook.
A psychiatrist who treated him.

793
01:08:23,073 --> 01:08:24,301
Good.

794
01:08:27,377 --> 01:08:28,469
- Give it a try.
- Okay.

795
01:08:33,850 --> 01:08:36,910
It won't respond.
Someone's on my frequency.

796
01:08:50,066 --> 01:08:52,626
Forget it. It's just not working.

797
01:09:23,133 --> 01:09:24,998
Now what the hell is that?

798
01:12:43,967 --> 01:12:46,026
Time's up, Callahan.

799
01:13:23,473 --> 01:13:25,031
You all right, Al?

800
01:13:25,408 --> 01:13:26,932
Shit.

801
01:13:39,989 --> 01:13:41,581
Two fractured ribs.

802
01:13:42,125 --> 01:13:45,117
He bled in the chest.
We drained it and set up an IV.

803
01:13:45,328 --> 01:13:49,094
He's lucky, the bulletproof vest
he had on saved his life.

804
01:13:49,966 --> 01:13:52,560
Another of my
grandfather's superstitions.

805
01:13:52,769 --> 01:13:54,828
When your partner gives you advice...

806
01:13:55,038 --> 01:13:56,005
...take it.

807
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:58,707
Harry.

808
01:14:07,283 --> 01:14:11,117
This is Dr. Friedman, chief
psychiatrist here at the hospital.

809
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:12,981
I'm sorry about what happened.

810
01:14:13,189 --> 01:14:14,986
I feel somewhat responsible.

811
01:14:15,191 --> 01:14:18,319
Your partner contacted me about
a former patient of ours.

812
01:14:18,528 --> 01:14:20,052
- Harlan Rook?
- Yes.

813
01:14:20,263 --> 01:14:23,926
At first, I didn't recall the name.
I found the file today.

814
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:26,793
He was evaluated here a year ago.

815
01:14:27,003 --> 01:14:29,471
The diagnosis was
process schizophrenia.

816
01:14:29,672 --> 01:14:31,105
Multiple personality.

817
01:14:31,307 --> 01:14:32,137
Exactly.

818
01:14:32,809 --> 01:14:34,777
His sense of self-hate
was so strong...

819
01:14:34,977 --> 01:14:38,071
...that he no longer had
any personality of his own.

820
01:14:38,281 --> 01:14:41,739
Consequently,
he substituted identities...

821
01:14:41,951 --> 01:14:44,419
...found in books, films...

822
01:14:44,620 --> 01:14:46,053
...fan magazines.

823
01:14:46,255 --> 01:14:49,281
Identities with which he had
love-hate relationships.

824
01:14:49,492 --> 01:14:51,858
He wasn't dangerous enough to hold?

825
01:14:52,061 --> 01:14:55,462
Most mentally ill people
are not violent, inspector.

826
01:14:55,665 --> 01:15:00,329
By law, a person who poses no danger
can only be held for 72 hours.

827
01:15:01,370 --> 01:15:05,170
I'm sorry, this is one instance
where the system failed.

828
01:15:05,374 --> 01:15:07,137
Is this address recent?

829
01:15:07,343 --> 01:15:08,776
I assume it's still the same.

830
01:15:12,882 --> 01:15:14,076
Samantha Walker.

831
01:15:14,283 --> 01:15:16,342
<i>This is Peter Swan, Ms. Walker.</i>

832
01:15:16,552 --> 01:15:19,385
<i>Your coverage of my predicament</i>
<i>has been thorough...</i>

833
01:15:19,589 --> 01:15:23,081
<i>... but my side hasn't been told</i>
<i>as well as it could be.</i>

834
01:15:23,292 --> 01:15:24,554
I see.

835
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:27,888
<i>I'm prepared to grant you</i>
<i>an exclusive interview.</i>

836
01:15:28,097 --> 01:15:29,997
<i>Are you interested?</i>

837
01:15:34,904 --> 01:15:36,371
No doubt about it.

838
01:15:36,572 --> 01:15:37,903
He's our boy, Harry.

839
01:15:38,107 --> 01:15:41,235
Explosives. Caps.

840
01:15:41,444 --> 01:15:42,570
Detonator.

841
01:15:42,778 --> 01:15:43,836
It all connects.

842
01:15:44,413 --> 01:15:46,381
Harry, you gotta see this.

843
01:15:51,254 --> 01:15:52,915
Talk about obsession.

844
01:16:09,605 --> 01:16:13,302
Looks like he had a real
Peter Swan shrine going here.

845
01:16:16,078 --> 01:16:17,943
I'm not sure.

846
01:16:18,147 --> 01:16:20,547
I could have sworn I put it in my bag.

847
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:22,809
But I'm not sure.

848
01:16:23,019 --> 01:16:26,546
- Bob, do you have my little mike?
- It's in your bag.

849
01:16:26,756 --> 01:16:28,155
Thank you.

850
01:17:06,729 --> 01:17:07,889
Look at this.

851
01:17:10,933 --> 01:17:13,094
I'll call the TV station.

852
01:17:25,314 --> 01:17:29,216
Samantha went out to the shipyard
to interview Peter Swan.

853
01:17:29,418 --> 01:17:31,511
Swan doesn't know anything about it.

854
01:17:31,721 --> 01:17:33,951
- What's this?
- A payroll stub.

855
01:17:34,156 --> 01:17:37,455
Sundown Security, made out to
Ed Butler? I don't get it.

856
01:17:37,660 --> 01:17:41,391
That's the company that provides
security for Swan's locations.

857
01:17:41,597 --> 01:17:44,293
Ed Butler may be an alias for Rook.

858
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:46,627
Where are you going? Harry?

859
01:17:46,836 --> 01:17:48,565
Harry!

860
01:17:48,771 --> 01:17:50,636
That's my car!

861
01:17:58,614 --> 01:17:59,444
Yes.

862
01:17:59,649 --> 01:18:01,549
That's the shot I'm looking for.

863
01:18:13,062 --> 01:18:14,859
What is it you want from me?

864
01:18:15,064 --> 01:18:17,430
You've got it wrong, love.

865
01:18:18,067 --> 01:18:20,092
This is what you wanted.

866
01:18:20,403 --> 01:18:23,167
An exclusive interview.

867
01:18:24,073 --> 01:18:25,335
But you're not Swan.

868
01:18:25,541 --> 01:18:27,566
Shut up! You don't know!

869
01:18:27,777 --> 01:18:29,904
You don't know!

870
01:18:30,746 --> 01:18:32,441
I know who I am.

871
01:18:33,115 --> 01:18:34,548
Do you know who you are?

872
01:18:34,950 --> 01:18:35,780
Do you?!

873
01:18:35,985 --> 01:18:37,350
Yes.

874
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:39,187
All those films he made.

875
01:18:39,388 --> 01:18:41,583
Those are my nightmares, not his!

876
01:18:42,358 --> 01:18:46,419
Every night I dream,
and somehow he reads my mind.

877
01:18:46,629 --> 01:18:48,790
He stole my thoughts.

878
01:18:48,998 --> 01:18:53,594
He put my thoughts on film,
and he takes all the credit.

879
01:18:55,705 --> 01:18:57,730
He can't get away with it.

880
01:19:00,376 --> 01:19:02,173
He has to pay.

881
01:19:08,317 --> 01:19:10,444
He stole my nightmares
and made them real.

882
01:19:10,653 --> 01:19:12,518
So I stole his Dead Pool.

883
01:19:13,022 --> 01:19:15,616
I'll play his game and make it real.

884
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:19,855
He can take credit for that.

885
01:20:45,748 --> 01:20:46,680
Drop it, Rook.

886
01:20:46,882 --> 01:20:51,114
You didn't die, Callahan,
so I had to find another celebrity.

887
01:20:55,624 --> 01:20:56,522
You're next.

888
01:20:56,725 --> 01:20:59,159
Shoot me, Callahan.

889
01:20:59,361 --> 01:21:00,919
Maybe you'll get lucky.

890
01:21:01,130 --> 01:21:05,089
Maybe my muscles won't contract
and drive this knife into her throat.

891
01:21:06,669 --> 01:21:07,693
Let her go.

892
01:21:08,537 --> 01:21:09,834
First the gun.

893
01:21:10,039 --> 01:21:12,166
Drop it and kick it over to me.

894
01:21:16,278 --> 01:21:18,007
Time's up. What's it gonna be?

895
01:21:26,622 --> 01:21:27,884
What the fuck?

896
01:21:32,761 --> 01:21:35,093
You've locked yourself in, asshole.

897
01:21:35,631 --> 01:21:37,030
Yeah.

898
01:21:37,233 --> 01:21:39,030
Just you and me, asshole.

899
01:21:41,770 --> 01:21:43,203
The gun, Callahan.

900
01:21:45,074 --> 01:21:45,904
Now!

901
01:21:46,108 --> 01:21:46,972
No!

902
01:21:47,176 --> 01:21:48,871
He'll kill us both!

903
01:21:51,580 --> 01:21:52,945
Oh, God.

904
01:22:03,158 --> 01:22:06,924
You let me down,
Mr. Famous-Fucking-Cop.

905
01:22:07,296 --> 01:22:08,957
You let Swan get away.

906
01:22:09,164 --> 01:22:10,756
You're the killer, not Swan.

907
01:22:11,066 --> 01:22:12,795
I should have killed you first.

908
01:22:13,002 --> 01:22:14,970
That was my big mistake.

909
01:22:15,271 --> 01:22:16,568
Now kick it over to me.

910
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:20,408
Harry, don't.

911
01:22:29,318 --> 01:22:30,876
Think you're smart, don't you?

912
01:22:48,070 --> 01:22:49,935
Callahan, you son of a bitch!

913
01:22:55,911 --> 01:22:57,742
I'm gonna kill you slow!

914
01:23:02,885 --> 01:23:04,876
Do you hear that, Callahan?!

915
01:24:21,730 --> 01:24:23,459
Stay in there.

916
01:25:32,668 --> 01:25:34,533
Callahan!

917
01:25:42,144 --> 01:25:44,339
Come on out, Callahan.

918
01:25:57,159 --> 01:25:59,525
There's nowhere left to run, Callahan.

919
01:26:00,462 --> 01:26:02,487
Don't make me come in and get you.

920
01:26:06,335 --> 01:26:07,962
The game's over!

921
01:26:08,170 --> 01:26:09,535
You're out of bullets.

922
01:26:39,368 --> 01:26:40,960
You know what that means.

923
01:26:43,071 --> 01:26:44,470
You're shit out of luck.

924
01:27:29,651 --> 01:27:32,552
- Where's Rook?
- He's hanging out back there.

925
01:27:38,026 --> 01:27:40,927
Inspector, was this another
hit attempt by Janero?

926
01:27:41,129 --> 01:27:43,689
Is it connected to the Dead Pool case?
