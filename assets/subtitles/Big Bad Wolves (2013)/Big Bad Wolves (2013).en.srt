1
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,063
I don't like the looks of this.

2
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,356
What do you want from me?

3
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:31,071
- Where's the girl?
- What?

4
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:33,737
What girl? What are
you talking about?

5
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:37,031
- Is the rumor about you two true?
- Which one?

6
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:39,951
Yeah, there are lots of
rumors. Be more specific.

7
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,994
That you play dirty?

8
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:45,119
- Oh, that? That's...
- True.

9
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,416
Wait, I don't know what
you're talking about.

10
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,915
This is some kind of mistake
or misunderstanding. Let go!

11
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,089
Ah!

12
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,631
Ooh!

13
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,182
Enough!
You're going too far!

14
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,556
Do I need to remind you
what our mission is?

15
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,307
Surveillance only!

16
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,400
No engaging in physical
contact with the suspect!

17
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:13,068
- We didn't engage him.
- He engaged us.

18
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,862
See? He can't stop
bumping into our fists.

19
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,287
- It's Tsvika.
- Don't answer.

20
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,008
Micki, you've got to
put an end to this.

21
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:36,719
As much as I hate to admit it,
I agree with Beavis and Butt-head.

22
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,090
- But Tsvika will fry us for this.
- Not if we bring him the girl.

23
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,841
Besides, the bastard
has already seen us.

24
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:42,934
You really think he'll
lead us to the girl?

25
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:08,369
One last chance,
where's the girl?

26
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,542
- I really don't know.
- What if he really doesn't know?

27
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,748
He knows, he knows.

28
00:06:15,817 --> 00:06:17,670
Oh!

29
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,722
Oh!

30
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:21,931
Yes, Tsvika.

31
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,300
Why isn't anyone answering me?

32
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:24,847
We've been kind of busy here.

33
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:28,097
- Are you still on his tail?
- Kind of.

34
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,724
- What do you mean ' kind of '?
- Long story.

35
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,728
He ran into us with his bike,
so we're questioning him.

36
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:36,071
- Questioning him?
- Yes, questioning him.

37
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:40,033
Wait, are you questioning him or
"questioning-questioning" him?

38
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,654
- "Questioning-questioning" him!
- Are you nuts?

39
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:47,248
We have no case besides a girl
who thinks she saw him!

40
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:50,039
Tell that
to the three stooges here.

41
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,912
Listen carefully, Rami.

42
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:55,041
You're the responsible adult,
so stop fooling around.

43
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:58,044
Clean him up, take him home,
walk him to his front dour,

44
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,921
- and kiss him goodnight. Is that clear?
- Clear.

45
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,390
Turn right, and then left.

46
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,309
A right turn.

47
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,853
Where are we going? That's
not the address we've gotten.

48
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,938
Why do you have my address?

49
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,529
Ah!

50
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,399
It's my parents' address.

51
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,821
Rami, you're making a
mistake. Believe me, it's him.

52
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,744
Give me one hour with him,
I'll make him sing.

53
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,914
- I'll do it in 30 minutes.
- In 15, with a cigarette break.

54
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,209
Look...

55
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,925
there's been an unfortunate
mistake. We're really sorry.

56
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:40,715
Speak for yourself.

57
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,088
Don't mind him.
Listen to me.

58
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:47,434
We're really sorry and hope you
won't tell anyone about it, okay?

59
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:53,060
I won't. I promise.

60
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,229
Of course he won't talk.
He did it.

61
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,728
I only have
two $50 shekel bills.

62
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,445
How much do you have?

63
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,735
What?

64
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,358
You heard me.

65
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,736
You too, give me
everything you've gotten.

66
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,864
- No way! Don't go along with it.
- Tsvika's orders.

67
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,175
Why don't you just give
him a gun?

68
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,547
Calm down.

69
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,424
No one asked you to chip in.

70
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,178
Okay, this is for the bicycle.

71
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:36,107
No need, it's okay.

72
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:39,478
- Did you hear him? It's okay.
- It's fine. Take the money.

73
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,492
Ah!

74
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:56,222
- Arik, how are you?
- Come in, Micki.

75
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,905
So, is daddy teaching you
how to be a cop?

76
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,280
It's "bring your child to work" day.

77
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,526
Ah.

78
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:12,450
He's a tough one, your son.

79
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,452
Let's get down to business.

80
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,450
Look, if this is
about the suspect.

81
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,918
Believe me, I had no choice.

82
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,003
My clad is speaking now.

83
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,591
- Cute.
- Arik.

84
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:29,258
I want you to pay close attention
to the following conversation.

85
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,256
I call it the yellow-card
conversation.

86
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,133
Like in soccer, dad?

87
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:35,636
Just like in soccer, son.

88
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,564
Tsvika, this isn't
very dignified.

89
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:41,183
And what you did was dignified?

90
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,401
Yeah, what you did
was dignified?

91
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:47,694
- Arik, don't disturb daddy at work.
- Sorry, daddy.

92
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,657
Now listen carefully, Micki.

93
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,573
Because of your mess-up,
our suspect was released...

94
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:55,447
- and released without talking.
- It's him. You know it's him.

95
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,995
All I know is that you
disobeyed a direct order...

96
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:00,494
Cover your ears, sweetie.

97
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:05,124
And that your actions could cost
that pretty little girl her head.

98
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:08,593
And if that happens, there'll
be nothing to stop me

99
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,590
from kicking your ass
to the traffic department.

100
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:12,714
Kicking your ass
to the traffic department!

101
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,551
Is that clear?

102
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:19,850
- I'm in a meeting.
- I know, I'm sorry.

103
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:23,942
This call just came in.
You should hear the tape.

104
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,026
Go on, play it.

105
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:28,772
Police department,
how may I help you?

106
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:30,991
I heard you're
looking for a little girl.

107
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,780
Excuse me?

108
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:35,529
I can tell you
where you can find her.

109
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,008
Micki.

110
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,555
You'd better come here.

111
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:11,918
That pervert became confident,
staged a whole production.

112
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,045
Tsvika is coming.

113
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,888
The commander got off his
high horse? That can't be good.

114
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,427
Micki, you're done here.

115
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,520
- Tsvika.
- Did you hear me?

116
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,935
Report tomorrow to Nissim
in the traffic department.

117
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,479
- You can't throw me off this case.
- It's Rami's case now.

118
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,647
Rami?

119
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,022
He couldn't find
a body in a morgue!

120
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,239
Nothing personal.

121
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,401
- Oh.
- Micki, did you hear me?

122
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,654
It's Rami's case now.
You can go.

123
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,431
He's the last person
I need now.

124
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,725
- Who is that?
- The girl's father.

125
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,143
Don't let him through.

126
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,358
What's he doing
at the murder scene?

127
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,478
He served with the chief
of police in Lebanon.

128
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:15,571
That doesn't mean he can do
whatever he wants.

129
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:47,015
- Is everything okay, superstar?
- It doesn't fit.

130
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,941
Shauli says
you need extra-large.

131
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,857
Don't worry, I'll give
you a celebrity discount.

132
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,150
- What's the deal?
- Come look.

133
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:01,326
Four thousand hits in two days.

134
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,614
If that isn't stardom, what is?

135
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,036
What the hell?

136
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:11,970
Does anyone here
know about this?

137
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,918
By this weekend, everyone will.

138
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:19,545
- Can you help me out with this?
- There isn't a thing Shauli can't do.

139
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:22,297
- But on one condition.
- Whatever Shauli wants.

140
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,892
That you ask nicely...

141
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:29,308
- and without the phone book.
- Very funny.

142
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:33,184
Shauli will make sure
it's gone by tonight.

143
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,738
Psst!

144
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:49,991
Psst!

145
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,124
Psst!

146
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,549
Psst! Psst!

147
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,323
Dana, could I have
the note, please?

148
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:30,991
Dana?

149
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,037
The note.

150
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,464
I've warned you about
passing notes, haven't I?

151
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:46,135
Could you not read it, please? It
has nothing to do with the exam.

152
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,475
Oh, I get it.

153
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:50,935
It's a love note.

154
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:53,350
Don't get me wrong.

155
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,265
At your age I also
passed notes in class...

156
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:58,108
but not during an exam.
Is that clear'?

157
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,958
Go on, kids.
Finish your exams.

158
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,364
Girl murderer!

159
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:48,280
Pedophile son of a bitch!
Rapist!

160
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:13,017
Can I come in?

161
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:14,602
Yeah.

162
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:17,643
- Sure, Meir. Come in.
- Thanks.

163
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:22,485
How can I help you?

164
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,775
You look a little pale.
Is everything okay?

165
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:27,524
Yes.

166
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,197
I'm trying
to go over some exams

167
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:32,412
before the kids return
for the next period.

168
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,622
How are the grades so far?

169
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,580
Excellent. Excellent.

170
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,703
I always liked Bible studies.

171
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,039
Can I take a look?

172
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:45,667
Uh... I haven't gone
through all of them.

173
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,043
May I?

174
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,475
Is this the only one,
or are there more?

175
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:09,399
I thought only the parents were
poisoned, but the students are too.

176
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,900
The parents?

177
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:12,572
You know how many
phone calls I got

178
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,366
because of that YouTube clip?

179
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:18,825
I'm sorry, Dror.

180
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:23,129
The parents have
put me in a corner.

181
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:28,376
Do what you have to do.

182
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,345
You know it doesn't
make me think any less of you.

183
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:36,142
I know, Meir.
I understand.

184
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:39,387
It's only temporary.
I'm sure it'll blow over soon.

185
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,434
- Hello?
- Daddy?

186
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,148
Hey, Shani, my baby!

187
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:26,518
So how's the new phone?
Does it work okay?

188
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,361
It's the best gift ever!

189
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,856
That's great. Listen,
sweetie. Two things...

190
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:35,076
Take this phone with you everywhere
and call me if anything happens, okay?

191
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,411
- Is that daddy on the phone?
- Shani?

192
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:38,780
- Let me talk to him.
- But I'm talking!

193
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,577
Shani?

194
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:42,496
That's really good parenting.

195
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,493
Uh...

196
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,746
Who buys a 10-year-old
a cellphone?

197
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,714
It's good in case
of emergencies.

198
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:50,674
I'll decide
what's good for her.

199
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,385
I don't have time
for this, okay?

200
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:56,472
Good, then we agree.
And don't forget

201
00:20:56,589 --> 00:21:00,344
- to pick her up on Wednesday.
- Okay, I won't forget.

202
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,410
Look at this.

203
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:26,127
He just arrived
and is going out already?

204
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,683
Who helps old ladies
these days?

205
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:09,620
Eti, tell me you've got something for me.

206
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,419
I've got exactly
what you're looking for.

207
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,463
When can I see it?

208
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,335
Now, if you want.

209
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:20,006
What's the address?

210
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,179
- I'll text you the details.
- You're an angel.

211
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,019
Just know it's a hellhole.
It's hours away.

212
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,434
A hellhole is good.

213
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:55,125
Well?
Did I nail it or what?

214
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:01,305
You nailed it!

215
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:06,181
Yours?

216
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,102
Funny.

217
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,272
If you ask me,
this is a serious dump.

218
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,737
I don't get why anyone
would want to live here.

219
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:19,232
- Eti.
- Sorry.

220
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,404
You're right.

221
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,778
The first rule of real estate
is never to judge

222
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,246
your client's taste.

223
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,370
But the interior
looks like a palace.

224
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:30,951
Shall we go in?

225
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,821
You said you needed
quiet to write.

226
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,940
I think this
is as quiet as it gets.

227
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,743
It's practically
a graveyard here.

228
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:09,206
- And the basement?
- The basement?

229
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:11,576
Wouldn't you rather
check out the bedroom first?

230
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:16,755
- Eti.
- The basement, the basement.

231
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,018
Big basement,
just like you asked for.

232
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,143
Shall we test it?

233
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:36,771
What do you mean
by "test it?"

234
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,987
I'll go upstairs,
and I want you to scream.

235
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:41,981
- Scream?
- Yes.

236
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:43,483
As loud as you can.

237
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,194
I don't get it.

238
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,161
My son will be playing
his drums here.

239
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,909
I want to make sure
it won't disturb my writing.

240
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:57,254
Oh...

241
00:24:57,371 --> 00:25:01,296
I get it. You freaked me out
for a sec.

242
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:04,842
So I'll go upstairs, you count
to ten and start yelling.

243
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:06,305
Sure.

244
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:20,735
Ten...

245
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,446
Nine...

246
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:25,862
Eight...

247
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:33,495
Five...

248
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:34,992
Four...

249
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,216
One.

250
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:49,678
The things you'll do
for a commission.

251
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:57,060
Ahh...

252
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:56,786
- You can stop now.
- You frightened me half to death.

253
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:59,205
- Sorry.
- Well, what do you think?

254
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,794
I think I'll take it.

255
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:03,084
Great!
You'll also like the price.

256
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:06,459
It's surrounded by Arab villages,
so it's really cheap.

257
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,301
Shall we go?

258
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,131
What are you doing here?

259
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:56,679
Still living
with your parents, huh?

260
00:27:58,177 --> 00:27:59,474
My parents are dead.

261
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,352
I thought
you only killed children.

262
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,819
You're not allowed to be here.

263
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,359
It's true what
they say about small dogs...

264
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:14,989
That they only bark?

265
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,828
This one likes to bite.

266
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,492
Hey...

267
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:20,287
This isn't over.

268
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:01,824
Hi, it's me.

269
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:04,543
I know, I see
your name on the display.

270
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,879
Yeah, you're right.

271
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,042
Funny.

272
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,212
What do you want, Dror?

273
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,677
I want to see you girls.

274
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:15,967
But I don't want to see you.

275
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:20,472
Anat, I didn't do anything.

276
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,640
I can't deal
with this right now.

277
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:27,813
At least let me see Tali.
Today is her birthday.

278
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,735
It's too soon, Dror.

279
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:35,281
I bought her
the bicycle she wanted.

280
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:38,994
Tie it to the fence tonight.
She'll see it in the morning.

281
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:42,285
By then
it won't be her birthday.

282
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:44,204
Dror, I have to hang up.

283
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:02,092
Come in.

284
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:04,682
Where's the kid?

285
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:07,272
Did you send him
to the traffic department too?

286
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:10,017
You're in no position
to be joking around. Sit.

287
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:17,949
What now?

288
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:31,709
Yes, Tsvika.

289
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,582
We've been kind of busy here.

290
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,627
Kind of.

291
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:42,092
You really screwed me over
with your blooper video.

292
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:43,592
Son of a bitch.

293
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:45,139
Who's a son of a bitch?

294
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,389
The bastard who promised
to take it off.

295
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,732
It's out there, Micki.
And it makes us look bad.

296
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,022
Real bad.

297
00:30:53,143 --> 00:30:55,737
The police already have
a bad reputation. Now this?

298
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:12,455
Listen, the guys upstairs
are pressuring me.

299
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,502
Oh, I see where
this talk is going.

300
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:19,887
It's only temporary,
until this fiasco blows over.

301
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:23,549
Tomorrow another clip
will go viral.

302
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,550
That's how it is
these days on the net.

303
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,803
You're a star
for a split second.

304
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:30,101
- Let's just hope he won't sue.
- He won't.

305
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:31,940
- How do you know?
- I just do.

306
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:34,560
- Seriously, Micki.
- Look, it's only a matter of time

307
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:36,732
until this clip
ends up on the news.

308
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:39,732
The only way to prevent
the shit that's coming our way...

309
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:42,826
is by proving the little prick
is guilty. Do you understand?

310
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,117
Why are you asking me?

311
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:54,497
You're not a cop anymore.

312
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:56,672
You're a civilian.

313
00:31:57,958 --> 00:31:59,960
Civilians can do
whatever they want...

314
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,678
As long as they
don't get caught.

315
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,442
Come.

316
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:33,106
Start digging.

317
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:35,981
You're making a mistake.

318
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:38,233
Dig, dig.

319
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:47,852
Did I ask you to stop digging?

320
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:09,324
Are you going to shoot me now?

321
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:11,747
Listen carefully.
I know that at this point

322
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:13,870
you'll confess to everything
I tell you to...

323
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:16,965
so let's just stick
to the facts.

324
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,958
I already have the bodies.

325
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,711
I want you to tell me
where the heads are.

326
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,255
What heads?

327
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,303
I'm asking you
for the last time.

328
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,552
Where did you hide them?

329
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:29,973
Stop!

330
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:32,226
I have no idea!

331
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:47,450
You're insane!

332
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:50,073
- You have to stop this insanity!
- I'll stop

333
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:51,825
once you tell me
where they are.

334
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:54,209
No!

335
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,195
Are you going to help me
with him?

336
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,590
Are you from his department?

337
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:43,085
Are you kidding?

338
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,008
I'm from Internal Affairs.

339
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,805
I hope you put an end
to this saga.

340
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:53,602
So do I.

341
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:57,064
You can get in the car.

342
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:02,062
Once again, thank you.

343
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:32,975
Before I let you go...

344
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:35,595
I must ask you...

345
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,439
not to try anything funny,
and not to shout.

346
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,900
Not because I have a gun...

347
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:44,738
and not because where we are
no one would hear you anyway...

348
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,732
but because we're adults...

349
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:50,576
and adults don't shout,
they talk.

350
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:53,242
Nod your head
if you understand.

351
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,047
Are you out of your mind?!

352
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:13,758
I thought we had
an understanding.

353
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:27,693
- Do you know who I am?
- I know who you are.

354
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:30,692
I think you've forgotten
who I am.

355
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:33,946
- Have we met?
- Not formally.

356
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:36,243
We met once in an abandoned
field.

357
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:37,866
Sorry, I'm bad with faces.

358
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:39,917
I'll help you remember.

359
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,207
You were standing
over my daughter's body.

360
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:47,334
One could even say
you put her there.

361
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:54,390
Don't be scared.
I have no interest in you.

362
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:57,101
You're only here
because you got in my way.

363
00:43:57,218 --> 00:43:59,437
And as I see it...

364
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:02,433
- you owe me.
- I owe you?

365
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:05,060
- According to the chaos theory.
- Chaos what?

366
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:08,814
Don't they teach you anything
at the police academy?

367
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:12,613
All it takes is for a butterfly
to flutter its wings...

368
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:13,950
Flutter?

369
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,453
I'll explain it in a way

370
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:22,453
that even a detective in the
Israeli police can understand.

371
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:28,750
If you hadn't beaten
the bastard...

372
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:31,924
he wouldn't have been released
and killed my daughter.

373
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,430
Why do you think
I kidnapped the bastard?

374
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:37,346
I saw what you did.
You're always interrupting.

375
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:38,918
I actually feel
I'm making progress.

376
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:43,685
You'd never get him
to talk anyway.

377
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:46,855
- Maniacs aren't afraid of guns.
- No? What then?

378
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:54,321
Maniacs are afraid of maniacs.

379
00:45:05,995 --> 00:45:08,373
As I see it,
there are three options here.

380
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:12,627
One, I let you go...

381
00:45:12,752 --> 00:45:16,006
but now you know too much,
and you might try and stop me.

382
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,349
Which leads me to option two.

383
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:22,266
I finish you off right now,
and frame you for all the shit

384
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:25,356
that's about to go down
with the smurf downstairs.

385
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:30,686
But you're a cop.

386
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:33,530
I don't want to break
my mother's heart.

387
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:36,322
So that brings me
to option three...

388
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:40,697
which seems like
the best option for both of us.

389
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:46,210
- I make you an accomplice.
- You want to kill him?

390
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:49,456
I want to know where he
buried my daughter's head.

391
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,129
If, as fate would have it,
he dies in the process...

392
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,878
from blood loss
or oxygen deficiency...

393
00:45:56,963 --> 00:45:58,965
you won't see me shed a tear.

394
00:46:04,804 --> 00:46:06,147
Well?

395
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,062
What's your decision?

396
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:17,408
I'm with you,
but only until he talks.

397
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:20,369
Good enough for me.

398
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:34,835
- Should we discuss strategy?
- Strategy?

399
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:36,802
You know, good cop, bad cop?

400
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:39,718
- There's no room for good cops.
- No problem.

401
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,011
Bad cop, bad cop.

402
00:46:42,091 --> 00:46:43,638
Uhh...

403
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,761
Do you want me to do anything?

404
00:46:46,262 --> 00:46:47,764
Follow my lead.

405
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:21,381
Are you okay?

406
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,257
Shall we begin?

407
00:47:24,717 --> 00:47:26,094
Yes?

408
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:27,344
No?

409
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:29,555
Okay.

410
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:32,141
Here we go.

411
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:43,986
Don't you have a phone book?

412
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:45,533
It works better
with a phone book.

413
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,327
We're not at that point yet.

414
00:47:49,075 --> 00:47:52,249
I thought I'd read The Dwarf,
a children's story, first.

415
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:55,169
Oh, sorry.
Didn't mean to interrupt.

416
00:48:01,087 --> 00:48:04,261
This fairytale was written
by the Israeli police...

417
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:06,510
based on true events.

418
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,646
And like any fairytale...

419
00:48:10,763 --> 00:48:13,482
ours also begins with a wolf.

420
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,647
The wolf is you, by the way.

421
00:48:17,353 --> 00:48:20,983
Our wolf is no different
from the other wolves...

422
00:48:21,107 --> 00:48:22,700
except for his height, maybe.

423
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:27,489
And like
all the other wolves...

424
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:29,741
he also likes
to surprise little girls.

425
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:35,497
But our cruel son of a bitch
doesn't just swallow them.

426
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:44,597
As the pictures show...

427
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:48,350
our wolf had a method.

428
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:55,562
He'd kidnap the girls and stuff
them with candy and cakes.

429
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:56,855
But alas...

430
00:48:58,144 --> 00:49:00,738
the cakes
contained sedatives...

431
00:49:00,855 --> 00:49:04,234
and so the little girls
would fall into a deep sleep.

432
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:08,120
Once asleep...

433
00:49:08,237 --> 00:49:11,912
he would shove his penis
into every hole of their bodies.

434
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:17,337
Now, before I go on,
I must ask you.

435
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:20,584
What's the matter? You couldn't
handle one little girl

436
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:22,927
so you had to sedate her first?

437
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:29,558
Are you insane?

438
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:31,177
Huh?

439
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:34,476
You're not normal.

440
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:36,557
It wasn't me.

441
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:38,767
It wasn't me!

442
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:40,395
You have to stop him!

443
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:44,486
Sorry, but I'd like to know
how the story ends.

444
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:52,706
Where was I?

445
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,496
He sedated the little girls.

446
00:49:54,617 --> 00:49:55,869
Right.

447
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:59,626
- Bravo.
- Thanks.

448
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:03,172
So after violating
every hole in their bodies...

449
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:05,386
he'd wait until they woke up...

450
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:10,638
and then their
real nightmare began.

451
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:14,353
The sick maniac would take
the little angels' hands...

452
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:18,065
and break all
their fingers, one by one.

453
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:21,061
The poor girls would
faint from the pain.

454
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:24,905
And what did
the sadist do then?

455
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,945
Wait for them to wake up?

456
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:30,445
Have you read this story?
Do you want to take over?

457
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:32,992
What? No, you're doing
a great job.

458
00:50:34,073 --> 00:50:35,199
Thanks.

459
00:50:39,078 --> 00:50:41,251
When they'd regain
consciousness...

460
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:44,171
he'd take off
their shoes and socks...

461
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:48,842
and rip their toenails
off their delicate feet.

462
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:52,342
I'll be dammed if I know what
he did with all those nails.

463
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:54,935
The dwarf must have
a collection.

464
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:56,224
So...

465
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:00,899
you take souvenirs, huh?

466
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:04,316
I guess you have a jar of nails
above your refrigerator, huh?

467
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:07,781
- We'll get to that.
- Sorry.

468
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:12,404
- I got carried away.
- It's okay, we're almost done.

469
00:51:12,528 --> 00:51:16,749
After the girls recovered from
what he'd done to their toes...

470
00:51:18,117 --> 00:51:20,119
and only
after they'd recovered...

471
00:51:21,704 --> 00:51:24,332
he'd saw off their heads
with a rusty saw.

472
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:28,677
The saw was so rusty
that in some cases

473
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:31,422
he'd switch to a less rusty saw
to complete the task.

474
00:51:33,549 --> 00:51:37,053
Two of those girls were fully
awake when he sawed their necks.

475
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:46,863
But he left the sickest surprise
for their parents...

476
00:51:46,979 --> 00:51:50,199
when he hid their
daughters' pretty heads.

477
00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:55,784
One cf those girls
was my daughter...

478
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,917
and as I see it...

479
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:02,082
you have two options...

480
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:06,378
to die like the scum
that you are...

481
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:10,052
or to die after you
redeem yourself.

482
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:18,515
Look...

483
00:52:19,762 --> 00:52:21,184
I can only imagine...

484
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:23,728
what you're going through...

485
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:26,193
and what something like this
could do to a father.

486
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:31,570
Are you being condescending?

487
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:35,490
Is he being condescending?

488
00:52:35,611 --> 00:52:37,613
There was a hint
of condescension.

489
00:52:42,368 --> 00:52:44,370
Listen carefully, shorty.

490
00:52:46,205 --> 00:52:48,048
I'm going to do to you...

491
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:50,418
all the things you did
to those poor girls...

492
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:55,339
finger by finger,
toenail by toenail...

493
00:52:55,464 --> 00:52:59,139
until your head
rolls onto the floor.

494
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:05,558
But...

495
00:53:07,226 --> 00:53:09,649
I'm willing to give you
a quicker death.

496
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:13,069
That's why my Glock is here.

497
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:16,159
Under one condition...

498
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:19,405
that you tell me where
you buried my daughter's head.

499
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:24,334
I don't know where
your daughter's head is buried.

500
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:27,876
I didn't do it.

501
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:31,800
All those things you read...

502
00:53:33,252 --> 00:53:34,504
that's not me.

503
00:53:36,422 --> 00:53:39,050
- You have to believe me.
- Sorry, I'm a non-believer.

504
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:44,271
- No!
- We'll start with the fingers.

505
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:45,731
Do you want to go first?

506
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:58,827
What's going on?

507
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:01,993
Don't you want
to stuff him first?

508
00:54:02,114 --> 00:54:02,956
Say what?

509
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:05,872
You said you'd
do exactly what he did.

510
00:54:06,285 --> 00:54:08,413
- Are you stalling?
- Of course not.

511
00:54:08,537 --> 00:54:10,289
I thought we'd do it
in the same order.

512
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:12,917
Did I say we'd do it
in the same order?

513
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:16,136
If we do, we'd have to violate
every hole in his body.

514
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:17,550
Are you into that?

515
00:54:21,208 --> 00:54:23,557
I didn't think so.

516
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:26,601
Let's just say we've made
some modifications.

517
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:28,978
What?

518
00:54:29,725 --> 00:54:32,820
Some changes,
to give us all a break.

519
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:34,859
Speaking of "break..."

520
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,403
do you want to break
his finger first...

521
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:38,867
or should I start?

522
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:43,034
Let's flip a coin.

523
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:45,832
I'll be heads, you'll be tails.

524
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,076
Agreed.

525
00:55:03,175 --> 00:55:04,643
I hate when that happens.

526
00:55:12,518 --> 00:55:16,273
- Found it.
- Great. What does it say?

527
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:17,864
Heads.

528
00:55:18,941 --> 00:55:20,113
I go first.

529
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:27,617
Don't you want to use
one of the tools here?

530
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:32,455
- No, I'll manage.
- Oh, I see.

531
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:34,707
You're the type
who likes the feel of skin.

532
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:44,308
If there's something you want
to tell us, now is the time.

533
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:50,013
I'm counting to three.

534
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:52,061
One...

535
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:53,855
Two...

536
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:58,614
Two and a half.

537
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:00,528
Is this gonna take much longer?

538
00:56:00,649 --> 00:56:02,447
Should I bring a sleeping bag?

539
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:09,370
If you can't
look in his eyes...

540
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:11,744
I suggest you stand behind him.

541
00:56:22,254 --> 00:56:24,723
No! No!

542
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:27,847
No! No!

543
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:31,059
No!

544
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:43,571
Bravo.

545
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:46,487
My turn.

546
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:28,699
It's my mom.

547
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:32,912
I have to take the call,
otherwise she goes crazy.

548
00:57:33,325 --> 00:57:34,497
Okay.

549
00:57:36,078 --> 00:57:38,376
You can continue without me,
but leave me some, okay?

550
00:57:38,497 --> 00:57:39,919
I'm not a hog.

551
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:42,710
Mom...

552
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:45,178
wait a sec,
there's no signal here.

553
00:57:50,926 --> 00:57:52,143
Mom.

554
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,978
When did you plan on telling me?

555
00:57:54,096 --> 00:57:56,394
- Tell you what?
- That you're moving out.

556
00:57:56,515 --> 00:57:58,108
Eti's mom told me.

557
00:57:58,225 --> 00:58:00,398
She found you the house
you were looking for.

558
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:03,568
You know things have been bad
between Tzipie and me since...

559
00:58:03,689 --> 00:58:06,317
Your generation,
you split up over everything!

560
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:07,909
Mom, it's not over everything!

561
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:09,619
Especially
at a time like this...

562
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:12,455
you're supposed to support
each other, not split up.

563
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:15,371
In our day it wasn't like that.
Marriage was forever.

564
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:33,302
If you have something to say,
now's the time.

565
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:40,313
You have to stop this insanity.

566
00:58:41,393 --> 00:58:42,736
You must believe me.

567
00:58:44,396 --> 00:58:46,239
It might look like
I'm enjoying this

568
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:50,236
and maybe I am in a way...

569
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:54,119
but believe me, I'd be happy
to stop breaking your fingers.

570
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:57,163
Now, would you please
start talking?

571
00:58:57,284 --> 00:58:58,957
Talking about what?

572
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:03,795
- I really didn't do it.
- They say it gets much easier

573
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:05,758
after the second finger.

574
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:07,549
Wait, wait!

575
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:14,601
What's the point
of all this? Huh?

576
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:19,188
If you torture someone
long enough...

577
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:21,770
he'll confess to anything.

578
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:27,026
What if I didn't do it?

579
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:29,524
Hmm?

580
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:33,111
What if you're making
a horrible mistake?

581
00:59:34,613 --> 00:59:36,911
Do you really want
to lose your job?

582
00:59:37,032 --> 00:59:38,784
I already did, thanks to you.

583
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:41,378
Wait a sec.
Listen to me.

584
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:45,290
If you continue this...

585
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:49,253
there's no going back.

586
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:55,217
I have a daughter of my own.

587
00:59:56,635 --> 00:59:58,262
Why would I do that?

588
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:02,766
You're a clad too, aren't you?

589
01:00:05,644 --> 01:00:08,818
If you're a dad too, then you
know what I'm talking about.

590
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:10,945
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

591
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:14,573
I'm talking about
how everything

592
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:16,321
changes when you become a dad.

593
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:20,496
The first time they...

594
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:23,245
smile at you.

595
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:30,715
That moment you swear
you won't let anyone hurt them.

596
01:00:34,548 --> 01:00:35,765
Please...

597
01:00:37,259 --> 01:00:39,933
I just want to go home
to my little girl.

598
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:52,365
Mom, we've been talking for five
minutes. I need to get going.

599
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:56,112
I want to see your new home.
Your dad and I are coming over.

600
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:57,954
This isn't a good time.

601
01:00:58,071 --> 01:01:00,290
I'm... a bit sick.

602
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:02,910
Sick? And who's
taking care of you?

603
01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:06,413
- I'm 45. I don't need a nanny.
- Yoram!

604
01:01:06,538 --> 01:01:08,711
Your son is sick.
We're going over right now.

605
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:12,382
- Give me the address.
- I'm not giving you the address.

606
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:15,722
- I'll ask Eti's mom to tell me.
- It's near an Arab village.

607
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:18,592
It's a dangerous drive at
night. You're not coming.

608
01:01:18,717 --> 01:01:21,140
- You're not giving me the address?
- No!

609
01:01:21,261 --> 01:01:23,480
Just so you know,
you broke my heart.

610
01:01:23,597 --> 01:01:26,271
- Mom!
- Now I'm angry. Goodbye.

611
01:01:41,156 --> 01:01:42,453
Where were we?

612
01:01:45,744 --> 01:01:47,963
I see you didn't make
much progress.

613
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:48,921
Yeah.

614
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:50,791
I figured I'd let
his adrenaline level go down...

615
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:52,668
so that he feels the pain
all over again.

616
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,758
You should've been a doctor.

617
01:01:57,756 --> 01:02:00,851
Unlike you, I feel
we've lost precious time.

618
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,346
But it's okay.

619
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:08,270
I know how we can
make up for lost time.

620
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:20,995
What are you doing?

621
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:23,331
- Aren't we going overboard?
- Say what?

622
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:32,211
Ah.

623
01:02:32,332 --> 01:02:34,801
You two were talking
when I was upstairs.

624
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:38,718
He must've gotten you thinking.

625
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:41,550
He's good.

626
01:02:42,801 --> 01:02:44,269
You're good.

627
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:57,740
What, are you going
to kill me now too?

628
01:02:58,233 --> 01:03:01,112
It would be stupid of me to
kill the cop that kidnapped...

629
01:03:01,236 --> 01:03:04,581
abused and executed
the prime suspect.

630
01:03:04,698 --> 01:03:07,542
- I'm not stupid.
- Okay.

631
01:03:07,659 --> 01:03:09,582
This isn't funny.
Put the gun down.

632
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:16,001
Get some rest.

633
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:51,934
Okay.

634
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:56,275
Now I'm ready to hear
what you have to tell me.

635
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:02,740
You look angry.

636
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:05,527
Are you angry?

637
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:22,047
Please, you have to stop this.

638
01:05:23,795 --> 01:05:25,797
I have a daughter of my own.

639
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:28,015
So what?

640
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:31,640
Am I supposed to feel sympathy?

641
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:33,308
Mercy?

642
01:05:35,098 --> 01:05:37,772
Is that haw you softened
sleeping beauty over here?

643
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:39,735
By speaking
about your daughter?

644
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:43,614
I'm a dad too.

645
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:45,449
Why would I do this
to a little girl?

646
01:05:45,567 --> 01:05:47,786
I really don't know.

647
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:50,655
Perhaps you can enlighten me.

648
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:52,999
Why would a father
do something like this

649
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:54,914
to someone else's daughter?

650
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:57,996
It was her birthday yesterday.

651
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:00,499
I'm sure it was very exciting.

652
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:05,674
I bet you had balloons
and lit candles.

653
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,302
Was there a cake too?

654
01:06:11,092 --> 01:06:14,346
I'm sure you didn't put the
secret ingredient in that cake.

655
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:18,142
Or do you like to touch
your own daughter too?

656
01:06:19,434 --> 01:06:20,856
Shut your mouth.

657
01:06:21,177 --> 01:06:23,696
Or do you have rules?

658
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:27,067
You only touch
other people's daughters.

659
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:33,744
I never touched your daughter.

660
01:06:36,326 --> 01:06:37,999
You may continue.

661
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,426
Okay.

662
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:30,592
It's the cake.

663
01:07:31,673 --> 01:07:33,175
I'll be right back.

664
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:46,897
We'll let you cool off a bit.

665
01:07:58,941 --> 01:08:01,085
No! No! No!

666
01:08:03,337 --> 01:08:06,417
No!

667
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:18,311
Great.
Now you wake him up.

668
01:08:22,557 --> 01:08:25,151
Suppose you break loose...

669
01:08:25,268 --> 01:08:26,565
what's your next step?

670
01:08:26,686 --> 01:08:28,313
Untie me!

671
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:30,281
It won't happen.

672
01:08:35,069 --> 01:08:37,071
No!

673
01:09:15,276 --> 01:09:16,448
Peace be upon you.

674
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:20,164
Upon you be peace.

675
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:22,784
Could you roll me one?

676
01:09:24,869 --> 01:09:26,121
Take mine.

677
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:29,340
I'll roll another one.

678
01:09:53,481 --> 01:09:54,698
Thank you very much.

679
01:09:55,775 --> 01:09:57,368
Is that it?

680
01:09:57,485 --> 01:10:00,034
I just wanted one drag.
My wife doesn't let me.

681
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:03,199
Your wife, huh?

682
01:10:07,245 --> 01:10:10,294
- Well, goodbye.
- Goodbye.

683
01:10:50,204 --> 01:10:54,300
I put one candle. At our age,
many candles would be impolite.

684
01:10:56,169 --> 01:10:57,466
Want to blow it out?

685
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:02,554
You don't have to.
I'll do it. Make a wish.

686
01:11:07,972 --> 01:11:11,021
Did you make a wish?
Don't tell me.

687
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:18,070
Would you look at that?

688
01:11:18,191 --> 01:11:20,410
We never get a break.

689
01:11:51,832 --> 01:11:53,901
God damn it.

690
01:12:01,484 --> 01:12:04,488
- What are you doing here?
- Ask your mom.

691
01:12:04,612 --> 01:12:07,240
As soon as she heard you're
sick, she made some soup.

692
01:12:07,365 --> 01:12:09,914
- Can I come in?
- Sure.

693
01:12:10,034 --> 01:12:12,287
Come in, come in.

694
01:12:18,793 --> 01:12:20,841
You have a stove?

695
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:40,523
- Can I be honest, son?
- Always.

696
01:12:40,648 --> 01:12:43,902
Your mom thinks
you're losing it.

697
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:45,949
She's worried for nothing.

698
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:47,743
I'm starting
to think she's right.

699
01:12:47,864 --> 01:12:48,990
Dad!

700
01:12:49,115 --> 01:12:51,413
You left your home,
moved to a hellhole.

701
01:12:51,534 --> 01:12:53,878
Pardon me, but... a hellhole
surrounded by Arabs.

702
01:12:53,995 --> 01:12:55,793
Does that sound normal to you?

703
01:12:55,913 --> 01:12:58,416
I just wanted to get away.

704
01:12:58,541 --> 01:13:00,794
Are you trying
to kill your mother?

705
01:13:00,918 --> 01:13:03,967
- Of course not, dad.
- Because you're killing her.

706
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:05,886
No, I'm not!

707
01:13:08,342 --> 01:13:09,559
Are you bleeding?

708
01:13:11,554 --> 01:13:13,272
- What?
- Bleeding, bleeding.

709
01:13:14,515 --> 01:13:16,313
Look at your lovely shirt.

710
01:13:20,313 --> 01:13:22,441
I was painting something
downstairs in the basement.

711
01:13:24,317 --> 01:13:25,819
While you're sick?

712
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:27,361
Yes!

713
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:29,746
But why red?

714
01:13:31,115 --> 01:13:33,789
- Red is for girls.
- Dad.

715
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:37,710
Whatever. I don't get
your generation anyway.

716
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:40,833
I think the soup is ready.

717
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:44,879
Come, let's have
something to eat.

718
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:38,099
Nothing beats mom's soup,
right, Gidin'ka?

719
01:14:44,897 --> 01:14:46,490
What was that, Gidi?

720
01:14:46,607 --> 01:14:49,076
On top of Arabs,
you have rats here too?

721
01:14:49,193 --> 01:14:52,322
- Forget it. it's nothing.
- Nothing?

722
01:14:52,446 --> 01:14:54,665
You've got one hell of
a rat there.

723
01:14:54,782 --> 01:14:57,911
Okay, I'll go check it out.

724
01:14:58,035 --> 01:15:00,538
- Should I come with you?
- There's no need.

725
01:15:02,415 --> 01:15:04,918
I think I can manage.

726
01:15:05,042 --> 01:15:06,635
Don't be a wise guy!

727
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:08,550
Finish your soup, daddy.

728
01:15:38,576 --> 01:15:40,954
My dad came to visit.

729
01:15:41,078 --> 01:15:43,547
I suggest you keep it down.

730
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:47,294
Nod your head
if you understand.

731
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:05,357
Do you understand?

732
01:16:13,903 --> 01:16:17,157
How about you?
Do you understand?

733
01:16:17,281 --> 01:16:19,283
What's going on, Gidi?

734
01:16:22,078 --> 01:16:24,080
You almost killed me, dad.

735
01:16:33,339 --> 01:16:36,309
- What's going on here?
- It's nothing.

736
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:37,847
Go upstairs.

737
01:16:39,762 --> 01:16:43,266
I'm not going upstairs until
you tell me what's going on!

738
01:16:46,185 --> 01:16:47,983
I think that's all of them.

739
01:16:49,355 --> 01:16:51,323
You've lost it.
Completely.

740
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:56,992
Dad, go upstairs.
I'll tell you everything.

741
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:09,212
I don't understand you.

742
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:11,085
I don't expect you
to understand.

743
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:12,837
You're throwing your life away.

744
01:17:12,962 --> 01:17:15,966
What life, dad?
Mika is dead.

745
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:18,184
I know.

746
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,894
But your mom is still alive.

747
01:17:21,011 --> 01:17:22,934
This will kill her.

748
01:17:25,015 --> 01:17:27,985
It's not too late
to back down, son.

749
01:17:28,102 --> 01:17:30,025
I'm going through
with this, dad.

750
01:17:30,146 --> 01:17:33,696
- Gidi, please.
- You know why Tzipie left me?

751
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,368
I'm not getting involved.

752
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:39,079
Some things are between
a man and his wife.

753
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:43,117
I was supposed to pick Mika up
the clay he took her from me...

754
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:46,253
but I forgot.

755
01:17:47,371 --> 01:17:49,214
You know why I forgot?

756
01:17:49,748 --> 01:17:51,421
Because I was
with my secretary.

757
01:17:53,794 --> 01:17:55,592
Gidin'ka.

758
01:17:55,713 --> 01:17:58,842
And while she was giving me a
blowjob, Tzipie called to say...

759
01:17:58,966 --> 01:18:01,139
that they called from school...

760
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:02,857
because I forgot
to pick up Michaela.

761
01:18:02,961 --> 01:18:04,934
Now do you get it, dad?

762
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:07,441
I put Mika...

763
01:18:08,893 --> 01:18:12,113
- ...in his hands.
- Don't say that.

764
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:15,073
No father should have
to bury his child.

765
01:18:15,191 --> 01:18:17,944
But if I'm already being
punished for my bad deeds...

766
01:18:18,068 --> 01:18:20,241
and I've clone plenty
in my time...

767
01:18:22,323 --> 01:18:25,543
then at least I'll take
that son of a bitch with me.

768
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:28,082
But not before
he tells me where...

769
01:18:28,204 --> 01:18:29,751
he buried the head
of my daughter.

770
01:18:30,497 --> 01:18:31,919
Your granddaughter.

771
01:18:33,167 --> 01:18:34,840
I owe that to Tzipie.

772
01:18:36,462 --> 01:18:39,466
No mother should have to
bury a headless daughter.

773
01:18:41,091 --> 01:18:44,641
Is there no way
to talk you out of this?

774
01:18:44,762 --> 01:18:45,763
No, daddy.

775
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:48,937
Not this time.

776
01:19:10,871 --> 01:19:13,795
Psst. Hey. Hey.

777
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:15,922
Can you hear me?

778
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:21,133
Next time he asks you where his
daughter's head is, answer him.

779
01:19:21,257 --> 01:19:24,761
- But I don't know.
- That's not the point!

780
01:19:24,885 --> 01:19:26,387
We're dealing with a nutcase.

781
01:19:26,512 --> 01:19:28,685
Just name a place,
buy us some time.

782
01:19:32,101 --> 01:19:33,227
Got it?

783
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:39,900
Just don't tell him right away.

784
01:19:40,025 --> 01:19:41,322
Take some pain first.

785
01:19:42,403 --> 01:19:43,871
Take some pain first?

786
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:49,369
Yes, for a bit, so that he
doesn't get suspicious.

787
01:19:49,493 --> 01:19:51,621
And then tell him.
Understood?

788
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:53,877
Understood?!

789
01:19:54,957 --> 01:19:56,049
Mm-hmm.

790
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:03,257
So what's the plan?

791
01:20:04,758 --> 01:20:07,807
- What?
- I want to help.

792
01:20:07,928 --> 01:20:11,523
- What do you mean "help?"
- I gather he's not talking.

793
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,483
Come on, dad.

794
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:15,352
Go home to mom.

795
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:18,230
I'm not leaving until he talks.

796
01:20:20,774 --> 01:20:22,742
Then tell mom
you're sleeping over.

797
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:24,612
The bastard won't be
talking any time soon.

798
01:20:28,866 --> 01:20:31,289
Have you done
the fire test yet?

799
01:20:32,369 --> 01:20:34,747
"Fire test?"

800
01:20:34,872 --> 01:20:38,627
They don't teach you anything
in the army these days, huh?

801
01:20:38,751 --> 01:20:42,096
If there's one thing I learned
while serving in the army...

802
01:20:42,212 --> 01:20:44,465
is that, much like animals...

803
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:47,514
what scares people
the most is fire.

804
01:20:48,761 --> 01:20:50,388
Fire, you say.

805
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:54,892
I need a blowtorch.

806
01:21:56,286 --> 01:21:59,586
So you're the son of a bitch
who killed my granddaughter.

807
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:08,307
What kind of monster
would do such a thing?

808
01:22:09,466 --> 01:22:11,218
What are you doing?

809
01:22:11,343 --> 01:22:15,564
Patience. You'll know
everything soon enough.

810
01:22:15,681 --> 01:22:19,151
Gidin'ka, will I have
to wait much longer?

811
01:22:20,477 --> 01:22:22,275
Sorry, it took me
a while to find it.

812
01:22:25,023 --> 01:22:28,573
- Dad, what are you doing?
- Defrosting the meat.

813
01:22:28,694 --> 01:22:31,538
That's great,
but that's the wrong meat.

814
01:22:34,241 --> 01:22:36,164
That's the cop.

815
01:22:36,285 --> 01:22:38,458
- That's the pedophile.
- Ah.

816
01:22:50,507 --> 01:22:53,056
How could I confuse the two?

817
01:22:53,177 --> 01:22:56,397
It never used to
happen to me. it's age.

818
01:22:56,513 --> 01:22:59,016
It does terrible things
to the mind.

819
01:22:59,141 --> 01:23:01,439
Your mind is fine, dad.

820
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:03,528
I can understand
your confusion.

821
01:23:03,645 --> 01:23:06,990
- You're just saying that.
- No, I can really understand.

822
01:23:07,107 --> 01:23:09,405
He looks more like
a pedophile than him.

823
01:23:12,779 --> 01:23:15,828
This one looks like
he couldn't hurt a fly.

824
01:23:15,949 --> 01:23:18,077
That's why he hurts
little girls.

825
01:23:34,218 --> 01:23:36,266
What are you doing?

826
01:23:36,386 --> 01:23:38,889
I hear you're not
talking to my son.

827
01:23:40,098 --> 01:23:42,692
I told him I didn't do it.

828
01:23:44,061 --> 01:23:45,734
Now I'm telling you the same.

829
01:23:47,231 --> 01:23:50,531
Could you talk to him?
Calm him down?

830
01:23:50,651 --> 01:23:53,575
You have my word
that I'll talk to him...

831
01:23:53,695 --> 01:23:56,665
but first I want you
to answer one question.

832
01:23:57,783 --> 01:23:59,660
Look at me.

833
01:23:59,785 --> 01:24:02,664
If I knew something, don't you
think I'd tell him by now?

834
01:24:02,788 --> 01:24:04,005
Maybe.

835
01:24:05,165 --> 01:24:07,634
But just to be
on the safe side...

836
01:24:09,002 --> 01:24:12,506
I'll ask one more time.

837
01:24:14,258 --> 01:24:15,555
Gidin'ka...

838
01:24:17,803 --> 01:24:19,430
the blowtorch.

839
01:24:25,561 --> 01:24:28,405
Are you going
to tell me where you...

840
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:30,482
buried my granddaughter's head?

841
01:24:36,947 --> 01:24:38,540
I really don't know.

842
01:25:01,546 --> 01:25:02,893
No!

843
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:29,500
You smell that, Gidin'ka?

844
01:25:29,625 --> 01:25:32,299
It smells like a barbeque.

845
01:25:32,419 --> 01:25:35,798
You have no idea how much
I've missed that smell.

846
01:25:35,922 --> 01:25:38,596
His mom turned
me into a vegetarian...

847
01:25:38,717 --> 01:25:40,435
because cf my high cholesterol.

848
01:25:43,013 --> 01:25:46,062
Oh, I could go on all night!

849
01:25:47,934 --> 01:25:49,732
Gidin'ka...

850
01:25:49,853 --> 01:25:52,948
I remember you loved
hot clogs as a kid.

851
01:25:53,065 --> 01:25:56,786
- Do you still like hot dogs?
- Who doesn't?

852
01:26:06,912 --> 01:26:10,587
No! No,
I'll talk! I'll talk!

853
01:26:14,544 --> 01:26:16,592
I told you, Gidin'ka.

854
01:26:16,713 --> 01:26:19,637
When it comes to the balls,
everyone talks.

855
01:26:33,814 --> 01:26:35,361
Talk.

856
01:26:37,275 --> 01:26:39,152
The girl...

857
01:26:39,277 --> 01:26:41,905
She's buried
in a derelict greenhouse...

858
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:45,121
five hundred yards behind
the school...

859
01:26:46,535 --> 01:26:48,162
where the new wing
is being built...

860
01:26:49,454 --> 01:26:51,127
in the southern corner...

861
01:26:52,958 --> 01:26:55,086
right underneath a fan.

862
01:26:59,339 --> 01:27:01,091
See?

863
01:27:02,843 --> 01:27:04,720
Where there's a will,
there's a way.

864
01:27:17,649 --> 01:27:20,573
I think I earned you today.

865
01:27:22,279 --> 01:27:25,829
Gidin'ka, don't tell
your mother about this, okay?

866
01:27:25,949 --> 01:27:28,202
It'll be our little secret.

867
01:27:28,326 --> 01:27:30,203
You're full
of surprises today, huh?

868
01:27:31,588 --> 01:27:33,040
Dad...

869
01:27:33,165 --> 01:27:35,588
I need you to watch over
these two until I get back.

870
01:27:37,419 --> 01:27:39,421
You can trust me.

871
01:28:18,585 --> 01:28:19,928
My wife.

872
01:28:21,588 --> 01:28:24,057
- Hello, Malka!
- Hello.

873
01:28:24,174 --> 01:28:26,518
Can you hear me?

874
01:28:26,635 --> 01:28:30,230
- Do you know what time it is?
- I do, I do.

875
01:28:30,347 --> 01:28:32,349
Why didn't you call
to say you'd be late?

876
01:28:32,474 --> 01:28:34,476
I was busy with our son.

877
01:28:34,601 --> 01:28:36,979
How's he feeling?
Did you have soup?

878
01:28:37,103 --> 01:28:39,231
We did.
It was delicious.

879
01:28:39,356 --> 01:28:41,700
So what are youndoing there?
Are you smoking again?

880
01:28:41,817 --> 01:28:44,036
Of course not.

881
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:47,156
Did you take your pill?

882
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,374
- I forgot.
- Of course you did!

883
01:28:49,491 --> 01:28:51,539
If I'm not there
to remind you, who will?

884
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:55,961
Take it now and eat
something solid beforehand.

885
01:28:56,081 --> 01:28:57,958
Okay, Malka. Okay.

886
01:28:58,083 --> 01:29:00,552
Otherwise you'll
have gas all night.

887
01:29:02,587 --> 01:29:06,012
Well, I'm going to sleep.
Be quiet when you come to bed.

888
01:29:06,132 --> 01:29:09,011
I promise, Malka.
Good night.

889
01:29:09,135 --> 01:29:11,479
I'll be as quiet as a cricket.

890
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:28,321
Something solid.

891
01:29:28,446 --> 01:29:31,290
Where will
I find something solid?

892
01:29:34,077 --> 01:29:36,671
This place is like
a student dorm.

893
01:29:36,788 --> 01:29:38,631
Bingo!

894
01:29:38,748 --> 01:29:40,716
Cake with frosting!

895
01:29:46,715 --> 01:29:47,887
Not bad.

896
01:29:49,342 --> 01:29:50,559
Not bad at all.

897
01:30:08,028 --> 01:30:11,282
Hope you're not mad at me
for not offering you some.

898
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:15,252
I have to eat some solid food
before taking my pill.

899
01:33:08,917 --> 01:33:11,466
Never cuff a cop.

900
01:33:24,099 --> 01:33:26,022
Come on, untie me.

901
01:33:26,142 --> 01:33:28,236
No, in your condition
you'd only slow me down.

902
01:33:28,353 --> 01:33:31,732
But I did what you asked me to do,
I bought us some time. Untie me.

903
01:33:31,856 --> 01:33:34,655
Listen, I'm going to get help.
I'll be right back.

904
01:33:34,776 --> 01:33:36,653
Don't leave me
with this lunatic!

905
01:33:36,778 --> 01:33:39,547
He won't find anything there.
He'll come back and slaughter me!

906
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:02,493
You have to help me.

907
01:35:11,664 --> 01:35:13,166
Why did you stop?

908
01:35:15,752 --> 01:35:17,550
I have to know.

909
01:35:18,838 --> 01:35:19,839
To know what?

910
01:35:24,510 --> 01:35:27,935
- Look me in the eye.
- You can't be serious.

911
01:35:28,056 --> 01:35:30,605
He'll be back any minute now.

912
01:35:30,725 --> 01:35:33,899
- Did you do it?
- I didn't do a thing.

913
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:35,693
Untie me!

914
01:35:43,404 --> 01:35:45,827
If you don't release me now,
you're making a big mistake.

915
01:35:50,161 --> 01:35:52,289
You'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

916
01:37:18,916 --> 01:37:20,008
Good evening.

917
01:37:22,253 --> 01:37:25,348
Why do you Jews always think
that we all want to kill you?

918
01:37:25,465 --> 01:37:27,513
No, not at all, but...

919
01:37:27,633 --> 01:37:29,556
you know how it is.

920
01:37:29,677 --> 01:37:31,395
Yes, unfortunately I do.

921
01:37:31,512 --> 01:37:34,766
Yeah. Say...

922
01:37:34,891 --> 01:37:37,189
you wouldn't have
a cellphone, would you?

923
01:37:37,310 --> 01:37:39,187
Why not?
Because we're primitive?

924
01:37:39,312 --> 01:37:42,532
- No, why do you say that?
- Isn't that what you think?

925
01:37:42,648 --> 01:37:44,696
Nut at all. If anybody's
primitive here, it's us.

926
01:37:44,817 --> 01:37:47,536
You people have the right idea.

927
01:37:52,992 --> 01:37:54,790
- May I?
- Yes, sure.

928
01:37:56,871 --> 01:37:58,464
Thank you.

929
01:37:58,581 --> 01:38:00,458
An iPhone, huh?

930
01:38:00,583 --> 01:38:03,132
- 4S.
- Nice. Thanks.

931
01:38:03,252 --> 01:38:04,879
You're a life saver.

932
01:38:08,508 --> 01:38:10,431
- Tsvika's office.
- Who is it? Rona?

933
01:38:10,551 --> 01:38:13,020
- Efrat.
- It's Micki. Put Tsvika on the phone.

934
01:38:13,137 --> 01:38:14,810
He's been looking
everywhere for you.

935
01:38:14,931 --> 01:38:16,774
That's why I called.
Put him on.

936
01:38:25,983 --> 01:38:27,485
Do you know how long
I've been looking for you?

937
01:38:27,610 --> 01:38:29,954
- Listen, Tsvika.
- No, Micki, you listen!

938
01:38:30,071 --> 01:38:32,620
- Your wife is here. She's hysterical.
- What?

939
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:34,913
Is it Micki?
Give me the phone.

940
01:38:35,034 --> 01:38:37,503
- Micki, where is she?
- Where's who?

941
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:40,214
Your daughter! She's not
answering her cellphone...

942
01:38:40,331 --> 01:38:43,380
- ...and you're not answering yours.
- She's not answering?

943
01:38:43,501 --> 01:38:46,300
Not since you picked her up
from ballet class.

944
01:38:46,421 --> 01:38:48,389
I thought those days
were behind us.

945
01:38:48,506 --> 01:38:50,884
Do you hear me?

946
01:38:57,515 --> 01:38:58,812
Is everything okay?

947
01:40:12,590 --> 01:40:13,716
Dad?

948
01:40:31,067 --> 01:40:33,741
Dad?

949
01:40:33,861 --> 01:40:34,862
Dad.

950
01:40:50,086 --> 01:40:53,431
Don't worry.
I'll do it quickly.

951
01:41:21,284 --> 01:41:24,379
It's a little rusty,
but it'll do the job.

952
01:41:25,663 --> 01:41:27,381
No, no, no!

953
01:41:42,513 --> 01:41:45,608
Enough, son.
That's enough.

954
01:41:48,853 --> 01:41:51,652
- Stop right there.
- What have you done?

955
01:41:52,773 --> 01:41:54,616
You're insane!

956
01:41:56,944 --> 01:41:59,038
I don't think that will help.

957
01:41:59,155 --> 01:42:02,329
He mustn't die! Get me
something to stop the bleeding!

958
01:42:02,450 --> 01:42:05,750
Gidi, I suggest you run quickly,
before the police get here.

959
01:42:05,870 --> 01:42:07,338
Are you people listening to me?

960
01:42:09,248 --> 01:42:12,377
Where did you hide my daughter?

961
01:42:14,045 --> 01:42:15,547
Your daughter?

962
01:42:16,756 --> 01:42:18,258
Please, tell me where she is.

963
01:42:19,383 --> 01:42:20,976
What did you do with her?

964
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:27,483
What do we do?

965
01:42:37,652 --> 01:42:39,074
Get a piece of paper!

966
01:42:39,195 --> 01:42:40,913
Some paper and a pen.

967
01:42:41,030 --> 01:42:43,658
Gidi, bring something.

968
01:44:35,911 --> 01:44:37,734
Hello.

969
01:44:37,855 --> 01:44:39,323
- Tsvika.
- Yes?

970
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:41,568
- We're done here.
- Did you find anything?

971
01:44:41,692 --> 01:44:43,365
No, we didn't find anything.

972
01:44:43,486 --> 01:44:46,035
- Wrap it up, then.
- Yes, I'm leaving.
