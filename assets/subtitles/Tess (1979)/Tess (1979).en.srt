1
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,161
- Good night.
- Good night, Sir John.

2
00:04:17,522 --> 00:04:19,802
Begging your pardon, sir.

3
00:04:21,122 --> 00:04:24,163
We met on this selfsame road
the other day...

4
00:04:24,283 --> 00:04:28,124
...and I said, "Good night," and
you replied, "Good night, Sir John."

5
00:04:28,444 --> 00:04:30,084
I may have.

6
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:32,805
- Did so again today.
- So I did.

7
00:04:32,965 --> 00:04:37,245
Why call me "Sir John" when I be
plain Jack Durbeyfield, the haggler?

8
00:04:37,405 --> 00:04:42,327
Just a whim of mine.
I'm Parson Tringham by the way.

9
00:04:42,886 --> 00:04:45,967
I made a discovery about you
while tracing some family trees...

10
00:04:46,087 --> 00:04:49,728
...for our new county history.
I'm an antiquarian, you know.

11
00:04:50,448 --> 00:04:52,929
You, Durbeyfield,
are directly descended...

12
00:04:53,048 --> 00:04:55,448
...from the knightly house
of the d'Urbervilles.

13
00:04:55,569 --> 00:04:58,410
- Did you really not know that?
- Never heard it before, sir.

14
00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:02,090
Raise your head a little so that I can
see your face from the side.

15
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:05,250
Yes, that's the d'Urberville
nose and chin.

16
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:08,331
- A trifle coarser than of old, but still.
- Daze my eyes.

17
00:05:08,491 --> 00:05:12,132
According to the records, your line
goes back to Sir Pagan d'Urberville...

18
00:05:12,251 --> 00:05:14,692
...who came from Normandy
with William the Conqueror.

19
00:05:14,852 --> 00:05:17,573
I've been slaving away
and living rough all these years?

20
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:20,894
Well, I thought you might already
know something about it.

21
00:05:22,214 --> 00:05:25,454
It is true, I got an old silver spoon
at home and a graven seal...

22
00:05:25,615 --> 00:05:29,975
...but I never paid them much heed.
Where do we d'Urbervilles live today?

23
00:05:30,095 --> 00:05:32,656
You don't live anywhere.

24
00:05:32,816 --> 00:05:37,096
You lie buried in your family vault
at Kingsbere-sub-Greenhill...

25
00:05:37,457 --> 00:05:41,618
...laid out in lead coffins with your
effigies under marble canopies.

26
00:05:41,738 --> 00:05:45,298
- And where be our family mansions?
- You haven't any.

27
00:05:45,538 --> 00:05:47,618
No land neither?

28
00:05:47,738 --> 00:05:49,259
None at all?

29
00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:51,939
You had an abundance of land
in the old days.

30
00:05:52,299 --> 00:05:54,739
What can I do about it, sir?

31
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,021
Well, as to that...

32
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,141
- Can I do nothing?
- Nothing whatever...

33
00:06:00,261 --> 00:06:03,141
...save possibly chasten yourself
by thinking:

34
00:06:03,422 --> 00:06:05,662
"How are the mighty fallen."

35
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,302
Good night...

36
00:06:07,463 --> 00:06:09,302
...Sir John.

37
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,825
Won't you take a quart of beer
with me, sir?

38
00:06:20,945 --> 00:06:23,905
There's a grand brew to be had
at The Pure Drop.

39
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:28,267
Though not so good as at Rolliver's.

40
00:06:34,588 --> 00:06:37,267
Sir John d'Urberville.

41
00:06:37,388 --> 00:06:39,308
That's who I am.

42
00:07:50,161 --> 00:07:51,881
What is this?

43
00:07:52,242 --> 00:07:56,123
- It is our club dance, sir.
- Club dance?

44
00:07:56,283 --> 00:07:59,483
- But where are your partners?
- They've not finished work yet.

45
00:07:59,603 --> 00:08:01,804
They'll be here by and by.

46
00:08:01,964 --> 00:08:04,764
- Will you join us till then, sir?
- With pleasure...

47
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:07,285
...but one partner won't go far
among so many.

48
00:08:07,405 --> 00:08:09,365
One's better than none.

49
00:08:09,485 --> 00:08:12,366
It is sad work a-footing it
with no one to give you a squeeze.

50
00:08:12,485 --> 00:08:13,926
Don't be so forward.

51
00:08:15,446 --> 00:08:18,286
- What are you doing?
- I've a mind to enjoy myself. Come on.

52
00:08:18,607 --> 00:08:21,047
You're full of nonsense.
Suppose someone sees us.

53
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:24,848
All right, go on. Don't wait for me.
I'll catch you up in five minutes.

54
00:09:41,662 --> 00:09:44,662
Sir? Hey, hey, hey, sir?
Hey, sir?

55
00:09:45,023 --> 00:09:48,223
Life has found me
a great gentleman.

56
00:09:48,384 --> 00:09:50,824
- Noblest in the county!
- Lord, oh, Lord.

57
00:09:50,943 --> 00:09:54,025
If it isn't your father
riding home in his cart.

58
00:09:56,105 --> 00:10:00,785
There bain't be a man in the whole
of Wessex with finer skeletons than I!

59
00:10:00,906 --> 00:10:03,186
Father's tired, that's all.

60
00:10:03,306 --> 00:10:05,666
He sent for the cart
because our own horse died.

61
00:10:05,827 --> 00:10:07,106
You know that very well.

62
00:10:07,267 --> 00:10:11,027
Rows and rows
of knightly ancestors, I got.

63
00:10:11,187 --> 00:10:16,189
Bain't be a man in the whole
of Wessex with finer skeletons than I.

64
00:10:42,794 --> 00:10:45,114
I'm glad you've come.
Where are you off to?

65
00:10:45,393 --> 00:10:46,915
I thought I'd change and help you.

66
00:10:47,074 --> 00:10:50,435
You bide here. I want to tell you
what's happened.

67
00:10:50,635 --> 00:10:54,636
We've been found to be the greatest
gentlefolk in the county...

68
00:10:54,956 --> 00:10:58,196
...reaching back long before
Oliver Crumble's time...

69
00:10:58,316 --> 00:11:00,917
...back to the days
of the pagan Turks.

70
00:11:01,037 --> 00:11:03,598
With monuments and vaults...

71
00:11:03,758 --> 00:11:07,078
...and crests and coats of arms,
and the Lord knows what all!

72
00:11:07,238 --> 00:11:10,318
Is that why Father made such
a mommet of himself in that cart?

73
00:11:10,478 --> 00:11:13,279
Our true name is d'Urberville.

74
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:17,080
That's why he came home in style,
not because he'd been drinking.

75
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,360
Where is he now?

76
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,401
It was a parson told him
the pedigree of the matter.

77
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,361
- But where is he now?
- Well, to tell you the truth...

78
00:11:24,681 --> 00:11:28,602
...he was that upset, he's gone off
to Rolliver's to get up his strength.

79
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:31,402
Much strength he'll find
at the bottom of a pint pot.

80
00:11:31,523 --> 00:11:35,004
Very well, I'll go and get him.
We'll be back afore you know it.

81
00:11:35,283 --> 00:11:39,444
Now, look, be a good girl
and put the little ones to bed for me.

82
00:11:47,085 --> 00:11:48,845
There it is.

83
00:11:51,526 --> 00:11:52,726
That?

84
00:11:52,886 --> 00:11:56,407
That spoon may be small,
but my family was great.

85
00:11:56,568 --> 00:11:59,408
- Jack, I've got a project.
- We owned carriages, estates...

86
00:11:59,568 --> 00:12:01,768
...and mansions without number.
- Listen to me.

87
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,289
Is there any money in it?

88
00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:08,009
It is well to be kin to a coach,
even if you don't ride in one.

89
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:10,489
I've been thinking since
you brought me the news.

90
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:13,331
- I've got a project.
- Which reminds me, woman.

91
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:17,131
You better find that dang seal
of ours, or I'll do you a mischief.

92
00:12:17,251 --> 00:12:21,292
Listen. There's a great lady
by the name of d'Urberville...

93
00:12:21,412 --> 00:12:23,172
...living out by Trantridge.

94
00:12:23,292 --> 00:12:25,532
Well, she's nothing compared
with us.

95
00:12:26,253 --> 00:12:28,573
Younger branch of the family,
no doubt.

96
00:12:28,733 --> 00:12:31,893
I'll wager they don't go back
to King Norman's day.

97
00:12:32,013 --> 00:12:34,414
That's as may be, but she's rich.

98
00:12:34,734 --> 00:12:36,774
Lot of good her money will do us.

99
00:12:37,095 --> 00:12:42,056
It could do. We must send
our Tess to claim kin.

100
00:12:42,736 --> 00:12:44,976
- Claim kin?
- Why shouldn't two branches...

101
00:12:45,256 --> 00:12:48,696
...of the same family
be on visiting terms?

102
00:12:48,816 --> 00:12:51,617
It would certainly put her
in the way of a grand marriage.

103
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:55,859
Then she ought to go there tomorrow.
Let's drink to that. Mrs. Rolliver!

104
00:12:55,978 --> 00:13:00,219
There you are, my poppet.
We was just on our way.

105
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,901
But you're asking me to go begging.

106
00:13:10,221 --> 00:13:12,582
Begging. What are you saying?

107
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:15,662
It is all in the family.

108
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:20,303
If they was in need, I should
take them in without a word.

109
00:13:20,503 --> 00:13:24,103
We all have to take the ups
with the downs, Tess.

110
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:25,824
Now, you must go and see her...

111
00:13:25,984 --> 00:13:28,744
...and ask her for some help
in our trouble.

112
00:13:28,864 --> 00:13:33,506
If the lady received me at all, it
would be enough if she were friendly.

113
00:13:33,665 --> 00:13:35,586
You must not expect her to help us.

114
00:13:35,786 --> 00:13:37,066
Come, come, my dear.

115
00:13:37,226 --> 00:13:40,906
With your pretty face,
you could coax her into anything.

116
00:13:41,066 --> 00:13:43,787
I'd rather try to get work.

117
00:13:44,747 --> 00:13:47,948
Durbeyfield, you decide.

118
00:13:48,108 --> 00:13:51,749
If you say she must go, she'll go.

119
00:13:54,709 --> 00:14:00,230
Well, girl, do you want to go visiting
this grand kinswoman of ours?

120
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:03,551
- I'd much sooner not, Father.
- There, she doesn't want to!

121
00:14:03,711 --> 00:14:07,872
I don't like my children making
themselves beholden with strange kin.

122
00:14:08,352 --> 00:14:12,713
I'm the head of the noblest branch
of the family...

123
00:14:12,832 --> 00:14:15,953
...and I got my pride to think of.

124
00:14:19,794 --> 00:14:23,155
All this bragging about your ancestors.

125
00:14:23,314 --> 00:14:26,915
It isn't them as will buy us
a new horse.

126
00:15:22,845 --> 00:15:24,766
It's all new.

127
00:15:56,852 --> 00:15:58,492
Well, my beauty...

128
00:15:58,652 --> 00:16:00,533
...what can I do for you?

129
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:05,693
- I came to see Mrs. D'Urberville.
- I'm afraid that's impossible.

130
00:16:05,853 --> 00:16:07,413
She's an invalid.

131
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:11,695
What was your business with her?
I'm her son.

132
00:16:12,015 --> 00:16:14,775
It wasn't business, it was...

133
00:16:15,735 --> 00:16:17,416
I can hardly say what.

134
00:16:17,815 --> 00:16:21,096
- Not business, sir, no.
- Pleasure, then?

135
00:16:21,216 --> 00:16:22,377
No, sir.

136
00:16:22,696 --> 00:16:25,537
It is so very foolish, I...

137
00:16:25,897 --> 00:16:28,977
- I fear I can't tell you.
- Never mind.

138
00:16:29,097 --> 00:16:31,178
I like foolish things.

139
00:16:32,138 --> 00:16:33,979
Try again, dear.

140
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:38,579
I came, sir, to tell you that...

141
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,180
...we are of the same family as you.

142
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,021
Poor relations?

143
00:16:47,302 --> 00:16:49,582
- Yes.
- Stokes?

144
00:16:49,981 --> 00:16:52,062
No, d'Urbervilles.

145
00:16:52,182 --> 00:16:54,662
Yes, yes, I meant d'Urbervilles.

146
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,704
Tell me...

147
00:16:58,143 --> 00:17:00,183
...do you like strawberries?

148
00:17:01,143 --> 00:17:04,665
- Yes, when they're in season.
- Here, they already are.

149
00:17:04,865 --> 00:17:06,905
Our name has become Durbeyfield...

150
00:17:07,185 --> 00:17:10,426
...but we have several proofs
that we're d'Urbervilles.

151
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:14,266
That's who the antiquarians
hold we are, so Mother said...

152
00:17:14,427 --> 00:17:16,707
...we should make ourselves
beknown to you...

153
00:17:16,867 --> 00:17:19,747
...as we've lost our horse...

154
00:17:19,907 --> 00:17:22,188
...and we are the oldest branch
of the family.

155
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,148
I see.

156
00:17:24,428 --> 00:17:27,949
So you've come to pay me
a courtesy call, really...

157
00:17:28,268 --> 00:17:29,829
...as one relation to another.

158
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:35,230
- I suppose I have.
- Yes. Well, there's no harm in that.

159
00:17:42,992 --> 00:17:45,872
I would rather take it
from my own hand.

160
00:17:46,592 --> 00:17:49,513
Don't be so coy, my pretty cousin.

161
00:17:52,513 --> 00:17:53,794
There.

162
00:18:13,678 --> 00:18:16,237
Come, this one too.

163
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:20,238
It's the perfect place.

164
00:18:20,358 --> 00:18:22,079
Believe me.

165
00:18:22,638 --> 00:18:24,960
You'll look a regular posy!

166
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:26,719
- What's the matter?
- A thorn.

167
00:18:26,879 --> 00:18:31,281
Cousin, beauty has its price.

168
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:38,362
I'm not very hungry. Truly, I'm not.

169
00:18:38,522 --> 00:18:39,762
Nonsense.

170
00:18:39,882 --> 00:18:42,363
You must eat something
before you go.

171
00:18:42,523 --> 00:18:45,403
It's no mean ride
from here to your village.

172
00:18:57,925 --> 00:19:00,325
I shall see what I can do for you.

173
00:19:00,486 --> 00:19:04,406
But listen, Tess, no more
of this d'Urberville nonsense.

174
00:19:04,526 --> 00:19:07,368
Plain Durbeyfield, understand?

175
00:19:08,007 --> 00:19:09,648
It's quite a different name.

176
00:19:09,927 --> 00:19:11,968
I wish for no better, sir.

177
00:19:16,009 --> 00:19:19,210
"In reference to your daughter
and further to her visit...

178
00:19:19,529 --> 00:19:22,610
...we write to inform you
of our willingness...

179
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:25,731
...to consider engaging her services...

180
00:19:25,891 --> 00:19:30,572
...in the managing of a poultry farm
of modern character.

181
00:19:30,731 --> 00:19:35,453
Lf, after a suitable period,
your daughter...

182
00:19:35,572 --> 00:19:38,933
...proves satisfactory,
we should guarantee her...

183
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:42,853
...comfortable accommodation
and a good wage.

184
00:19:43,014 --> 00:19:47,654
Your earliest reply would be
greatly appreciated."

185
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:50,815
So you charmed them after all,
did you?

186
00:19:50,935 --> 00:19:53,295
Let me see that letter.

187
00:19:53,456 --> 00:19:55,336
- Who wrote it?
- Who?

188
00:19:55,497 --> 00:19:59,777
Mrs. D'Urberville, of course.
Look at the signature.

189
00:20:00,097 --> 00:20:03,098
Me? Manage a poultry farm?

190
00:20:04,218 --> 00:20:07,258
- I truly don't think I should go.
- Poultry.

191
00:20:07,538 --> 00:20:12,739
It is just her way of getting you there
without raising your hopes too much.

192
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,700
She's going to own you as kin.

193
00:20:14,819 --> 00:20:17,260
Hey! The seal!

194
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,060
This is it!

195
00:20:20,061 --> 00:20:22,261
It's the same as ours.
Look at it, lad.

196
00:20:22,381 --> 00:20:25,742
A ramping, great, big lion
with a castle on top.

197
00:20:26,222 --> 00:20:27,662
There's no denying it, girl.

198
00:20:27,822 --> 00:20:30,102
Mrs. D'Urberville recognized
her own flesh and blood.

199
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:32,103
But she never even saw me.

200
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:35,544
Well, you couldn't expect her to throw
her arms round your neck...

201
00:20:35,703 --> 00:20:37,664
...her being an invalid.

202
00:20:37,824 --> 00:20:43,025
But her son made you welcome.
He called you "cousin," didn't he?

203
00:20:43,905 --> 00:20:46,386
I'd rather bide here with you.

204
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,751
Goodbye, Father.

205
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:15,391
- You're off, then?
- Yes. Goodbye, Father.

206
00:21:15,671 --> 00:21:17,511
Goodbye, girl.

207
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:20,431
You're a comely sight.

208
00:21:20,792 --> 00:21:23,273
This young cousin of yours...

209
00:21:23,593 --> 00:21:27,233
...tell him that, being so come down
in the world...

210
00:21:27,673 --> 00:21:29,554
...l'll sell him the title.

211
00:21:30,314 --> 00:21:32,874
Yes, I'll sell it, but a fair price.

212
00:21:32,994 --> 00:21:35,395
Not less than
a thousand pounds, mind.

213
00:21:35,714 --> 00:21:39,035
That's right, tell him
I'll take a thousand pounds.

214
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:43,156
Well, now I come to think on it...

215
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:47,277
...he can have it for a hundred.
I won't stand on trifles.

216
00:21:49,198 --> 00:21:50,718
Fifty.

217
00:21:51,077 --> 00:21:53,239
Twenty pounds, tell him,
and not a penny less.

218
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:58,879
- Family honor is family honor.
- Come, it's time to go.

219
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,920
I want to walk a little ways
with Tess.

220
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,600
So do I, now she's leaving
to marry our gentleman cousin.

221
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,440
I'll hear no more of that.

222
00:22:06,561 --> 00:22:09,521
Mother, how could you have put
such nonsense into their heads?

223
00:22:09,641 --> 00:22:12,322
She's going to work for a rich relation,
my dears...

224
00:22:12,481 --> 00:22:15,242
...and help us earn enough money
to get a new horse.

225
00:22:26,084 --> 00:22:30,084
Oh, Mother, I wish our Tess
hadn't gone to be a lady.

226
00:22:52,649 --> 00:22:55,970
Don't hold my arm!
Grab me round the waist!

227
00:23:07,091 --> 00:23:10,452
Ungrateful little minx. Why abandon
me as soon as you feel safe?

228
00:23:10,773 --> 00:23:12,693
The danger came of your foolishness.

229
00:23:12,853 --> 00:23:15,173
I say, what a temper.

230
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:18,094
When people are on top of a hill,
they have to get down somehow.

231
00:23:18,374 --> 00:23:19,974
But not at a gallop, surely.

232
00:23:20,254 --> 00:23:23,535
Fancy being asked that
by a brave little beauty like you.

233
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:26,295
I always go downhill at a gallop.

234
00:23:26,455 --> 00:23:28,536
You can't beat it
for stirring the blood.

235
00:23:28,695 --> 00:23:31,376
But perhaps you needn't
do so again.

236
00:23:31,537 --> 00:23:33,257
Perhaps not.

237
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,097
It all depends.

238
00:23:35,257 --> 00:23:39,498
One little kiss on those ruby lips
or even on that satin cheek...

239
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:42,019
...and I drive at a snail's pace,
word of honor.

240
00:23:42,298 --> 00:23:44,859
But I don't want to be kissed, sir.

241
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,260
Stop, stop, I beg you!

242
00:23:52,461 --> 00:23:56,101
Very well, do as you wish.
I don't mind.

243
00:23:56,221 --> 00:24:00,102
But I thought you'd protect me,
being a kinsman.

244
00:24:01,582 --> 00:24:03,942
Kinsman be hanged.

245
00:24:08,263 --> 00:24:11,384
You're mighty sensitive
for a village lass.

246
00:24:22,146 --> 00:24:24,946
- Oh, my hat!
- Whoa, boy.

247
00:24:34,227 --> 00:24:36,788
You look even prettier without it!

248
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:49,071
- Come along, now. Up you get.
- No, sir.

249
00:24:49,191 --> 00:24:51,431
- You won't ride with me?
- No, I shall walk.

250
00:24:51,591 --> 00:24:53,952
It's four miles to Trantridge, at least.

251
00:24:54,311 --> 00:24:57,313
I wouldn't care if it were 20.

252
00:25:06,794 --> 00:25:10,755
You watch out for Dollop, the bailiff.
He's a devil.

253
00:25:11,074 --> 00:25:13,996
Not Mr. Alec. Spends half
his time on horseback...

254
00:25:14,156 --> 00:25:16,715
...and the rest of it chasing
the likes of us.

255
00:25:17,956 --> 00:25:20,916
His mother's a queer old soul,
but no real trouble.

256
00:25:21,357 --> 00:25:23,477
It is a mercy for us she's blind.

257
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:28,838
- Mrs. D'Urberville's blind?
- Stone-blind.

258
00:25:29,838 --> 00:25:32,038
Their real name is Stoke.

259
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:35,640
How's that?

260
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,680
It were Mr. Alec's father
had the notion.

261
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,360
He bought the name
of an old extinguished family...

262
00:25:40,481 --> 00:25:41,840
...to make himself important.

263
00:25:41,961 --> 00:25:44,761
Whatever are you doing?
Missus is waiting for her birds.

264
00:25:44,881 --> 00:25:46,802
Quick, it slipped my mind entirely.

265
00:25:47,121 --> 00:25:49,562
Now, you catch hold
of Phena there...

266
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,402
...and that one.

267
00:26:14,446 --> 00:26:16,807
That one there and the white one.

268
00:26:41,771 --> 00:26:44,653
So you are the new young woman.

269
00:26:44,772 --> 00:26:48,213
Well, how are my birds?

270
00:27:00,575 --> 00:27:02,615
This is Strut.

271
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,416
He doesn't seem so lively today,
does he?

272
00:27:09,097 --> 00:27:12,857
He's alarmed at being handled
by a stranger, I suppose.

273
00:27:13,857 --> 00:27:15,338
And Phena?

274
00:27:20,098 --> 00:27:22,340
Yes, yes.

275
00:27:22,459 --> 00:27:26,140
They are a little frightened.
Aren't you, my poor dears?

276
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,981
Never mind.

277
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,101
They'll soon get used to you.

278
00:27:30,261 --> 00:27:32,061
Can you whistle?

279
00:27:33,061 --> 00:27:34,142
Whistle, ma'am?

280
00:27:34,501 --> 00:27:36,742
Yes, whistle tunes.

281
00:27:38,022 --> 00:27:39,342
A little.

282
00:27:39,462 --> 00:27:41,662
Then you will have to practice
every day.

283
00:27:41,783 --> 00:27:45,584
I think a lot of my fowls, but there are
also my bullfinches to consider.

284
00:27:45,703 --> 00:27:49,384
I had a young lad who whistled
to them very well, but he left.

285
00:27:49,505 --> 00:27:51,105
They've been neglected for days.

286
00:27:51,224 --> 00:27:53,705
Master Alec whistled to them
this morning, ma'am.

287
00:27:54,225 --> 00:27:56,145
Him.

288
00:28:17,709 --> 00:28:22,830
Nor art nor nature ever created
a lovelier thing than you, Cousin Tess.

289
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:26,751
To see that pretty mouth
pouting and puffing away...

290
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,792
...without producing a single note.

291
00:28:28,911 --> 00:28:32,552
- It is all a part of my work, sir.
- Never mind. I'll teach you.

292
00:28:33,353 --> 00:28:37,233
I won't lay a finger on you.
See? I'll stay exactly where I am.

293
00:28:38,113 --> 00:28:39,914
Now you watch me.

294
00:28:40,834 --> 00:28:43,554
Don't screw up your lips too tight.

295
00:28:43,674 --> 00:28:45,515
Do it like this.

296
00:28:51,315 --> 00:28:53,236
Blow gently.

297
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:57,676
Gently.

298
00:28:58,597 --> 00:29:00,077
Try.

299
00:29:04,318 --> 00:29:06,799
No, no. Try again.

300
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,599
Again.

301
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:19,121
There. You'll manage splendidly
now I've started you off.

302
00:29:20,481 --> 00:29:24,282
Tell me, Tess, don't you find
my mother a little odd?

303
00:29:25,962 --> 00:29:28,242
I hardly know her, sir.

304
00:29:28,883 --> 00:29:31,723
Well, I'm not in her good books
at the moment.

305
00:29:31,883 --> 00:29:35,124
But you should find favor
if you treat her livestock well.

306
00:29:42,366 --> 00:29:44,405
If you meet with any difficulties...

307
00:29:44,526 --> 00:29:46,126
...don't go to Dollop...

308
00:29:46,246 --> 00:29:47,886
...come to me.

309
00:31:03,901 --> 00:31:06,821
What? Don't you fancy
a dance, then?

310
00:31:07,461 --> 00:31:08,942
I'm mortal tired.

311
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:13,783
- When are you all going home?
- Soon enough, soon enough.

312
00:31:18,623 --> 00:31:20,263
Well, my beauty.

313
00:31:20,423 --> 00:31:22,424
What are you doing here
this time of night?

314
00:31:22,544 --> 00:31:24,264
I'm waiting for the others, sir...

315
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:26,585
...not being acquainted
with the road home.

316
00:31:26,704 --> 00:31:29,105
I only have a saddle horse.
Come to the inn with me.

317
00:31:29,265 --> 00:31:30,865
I'll hire a trap for us both.

318
00:31:31,146 --> 00:31:34,866
No, no. Thank you,
but I promised to wait for them.

319
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:40,148
Very well. Silly girl.
Please yourself.

320
00:32:02,592 --> 00:32:05,231
What's that creeping
down your back?

321
00:32:08,592 --> 00:32:10,153
Well, I declare!

322
00:32:11,393 --> 00:32:13,113
It is treacle!

323
00:32:37,598 --> 00:32:40,758
- You dare laugh at me, you hussy.
- I can't help it.

324
00:32:40,879 --> 00:32:42,679
No more than the others.

325
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:45,399
You think you're the queen
of Trantridge...

326
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:48,240
...just because you're first favorite
with him.

327
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,400
She never said anything.
Leave her.

328
00:32:50,561 --> 00:32:54,081
I'll show you. I'm worth two of your
sort for all your airs and graces.

329
00:32:54,241 --> 00:32:55,961
If I'd known what sort you were...

330
00:32:56,081 --> 00:32:59,162
...l'd never have lowered myself
by accepting your company.

331
00:32:59,282 --> 00:33:02,322
- I'll show you.
- Hey there, workfolk.

332
00:33:03,843 --> 00:33:05,483
What's all the row about?

333
00:33:06,963 --> 00:33:09,323
Quickly, jump up beside me.

334
00:33:22,206 --> 00:33:25,087
Out of the frying pan, into the fire.

335
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:43,330
- Where are we?
- Passing through The Chase.

336
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:45,091
The Chase?

337
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:47,570
It is out of our way, surely.

338
00:33:47,731 --> 00:33:51,452
This forest is one of the oldest
and loveliest in England, Tess.

339
00:33:51,572 --> 00:33:53,532
Don't you think it deserves
to be seen...

340
00:33:53,692 --> 00:33:55,932
...on a glorious God-given
night like this?

341
00:33:56,213 --> 00:33:57,412
Yes, but...

342
00:33:57,533 --> 00:34:00,133
No buts. There's a good girl.

343
00:34:01,094 --> 00:34:04,134
I'll be honest with you.
I'm happy.

344
00:34:04,294 --> 00:34:06,775
I'm trying to prolong the moment.

345
00:34:08,454 --> 00:34:10,375
You were shivering a while back.

346
00:34:10,695 --> 00:34:13,096
Now I can feel your warmth
against me.

347
00:34:13,255 --> 00:34:17,097
- Are you still cold?
- No, not now.

348
00:34:17,857 --> 00:34:20,657
I'll let my animal
walk a little further.

349
00:34:20,817 --> 00:34:23,217
He'll make better progress
once he's rested.

350
00:34:25,498 --> 00:34:26,658
Tell me...

351
00:34:26,938 --> 00:34:30,259
...what news of your parents' horse?
- They have no horse.

352
00:34:30,379 --> 00:34:33,940
They have since Monday last.

353
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,700
- Did you...?
- Forgive me for mentioning it.

354
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,860
I thought they would have
written to you.

355
00:34:41,101 --> 00:34:44,541
- I don't know what to say.
- It's nothing.

356
00:34:44,661 --> 00:34:48,582
I knew how important it was
for your father to have a new horse.

357
00:34:48,702 --> 00:34:50,342
Really.

358
00:34:50,503 --> 00:34:52,343
It's you he should thank.

359
00:34:53,303 --> 00:34:55,303
I'm grateful to you.

360
00:34:55,424 --> 00:34:57,784
Truly I am.

361
00:34:58,744 --> 00:35:01,025
But I almost wish
you hadn't done this.

362
00:35:02,025 --> 00:35:04,065
Yes, I almost do.

363
00:35:04,386 --> 00:35:07,226
- Is that a reproach?
- Oh, no.

364
00:35:07,346 --> 00:35:09,906
It is very kind of you, I'm sure.

365
00:35:11,467 --> 00:35:14,667
I've been in torment
ever since you came to us.

366
00:35:17,507 --> 00:35:21,149
- Then I'll leave tomorrow, sir.
- That's absurd.

367
00:35:21,748 --> 00:35:24,029
I don't want you to leave.

368
00:35:24,189 --> 00:35:26,669
That's the last thing I want.

369
00:35:28,509 --> 00:35:30,710
Is there no hope for me?

370
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:33,111
None at all?

371
00:35:34,431 --> 00:35:36,151
Tess.

372
00:35:36,711 --> 00:35:39,031
I'm dying for you.

373
00:35:39,191 --> 00:35:40,912
Can't you see?

374
00:35:58,675 --> 00:36:00,396
Forgive me.

375
00:36:01,596 --> 00:36:03,476
Oh, please forgive me.

376
00:36:03,796 --> 00:36:06,837
- Are you hurt?
- No, it's nothing. Nothing.

377
00:36:08,117 --> 00:36:09,998
You're bleeding.

378
00:36:14,918 --> 00:36:16,479
Oh, my God.

379
00:36:17,799 --> 00:36:20,520
How ever could I have
done such a thing?

380
00:39:18,752 --> 00:39:20,233
It's me.

381
00:39:22,113 --> 00:39:25,314
Don't be so foolish.
Open the door.

382
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:31,154
You'll force me
to make a noise, Tess.

383
00:39:32,515 --> 00:39:36,276
My mother has sharp ears.
She'll hear.

384
00:39:39,676 --> 00:39:43,557
Enough of this nonsense, darling.
Open up.

385
00:40:12,802 --> 00:40:14,763
Why sneak away...

386
00:40:15,123 --> 00:40:16,684
...like a thief?

387
00:40:17,163 --> 00:40:19,243
And at this hour in the morning?

388
00:40:20,164 --> 00:40:22,965
Nobody would've prevented
you leaving.

389
00:40:24,924 --> 00:40:27,085
At least let me drive you home.

390
00:40:33,407 --> 00:40:35,446
Unless you'd care to come back.

391
00:40:35,607 --> 00:40:37,447
I shan't come back.

392
00:41:04,972 --> 00:41:09,213
- What are you crying for?
- I was only thinking...

393
00:41:09,373 --> 00:41:10,853
...I was born over there.

394
00:41:12,373 --> 00:41:15,975
Well, we all have
to be born somewhere.

395
00:41:16,134 --> 00:41:19,374
L... I wish I'd never been born.

396
00:41:19,535 --> 00:41:24,776
- There or anywhere else.
- You're absurdly melancholy, Tess.

397
00:41:24,895 --> 00:41:27,416
You can hold your own for beauty
against any woman.

398
00:41:27,576 --> 00:41:29,016
Queen or commoner.

399
00:41:29,217 --> 00:41:33,498
I tell you that as a practical man
who wishes you well.

400
00:41:33,817 --> 00:41:37,218
If you're wise, you'll let the world
get a clearer sight of that beauty...

401
00:41:37,378 --> 00:41:38,979
...before it fades.

402
00:41:39,859 --> 00:41:42,659
Why not make the most of life?

403
00:41:42,819 --> 00:41:45,059
We didn't fare so badly
together, did we?

404
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:48,900
- I was blinded for a while, that's all.
- That's what all women say.

405
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,581
How dare you talk like that?

406
00:41:51,701 --> 00:41:54,901
Has it never struck you what all
women say, some women may feel?

407
00:41:55,062 --> 00:41:57,862
- All right. I was wrong, I admit it.
- Please, please stop.

408
00:41:58,022 --> 00:42:00,302
I should like to get down here.

409
00:42:09,384 --> 00:42:12,264
I'm a bad lot, I suppose.
A damn bad lot.

410
00:42:12,425 --> 00:42:16,706
I was born bad,
and I warrant I'll die bad.

411
00:42:18,066 --> 00:42:19,946
Listen, Tess...

412
00:42:20,106 --> 00:42:23,227
...if circumstances should arise,
do you understand?

413
00:42:23,346 --> 00:42:26,987
If you're ever in the least trouble,
the least difficulty...

414
00:42:27,507 --> 00:42:31,628
...just send me one line, and you shall
have whatever you need by return.

415
00:42:36,909 --> 00:42:39,150
You really won't come back?

416
00:42:45,951 --> 00:42:48,231
Goodbye, my four months' cousin.

417
00:42:50,312 --> 00:42:51,712
Goodbye.

418
00:44:58,135 --> 00:44:59,495
Tess?

419
00:45:47,985 --> 00:45:50,626
It is no use her pretending
she hates it...

420
00:45:50,945 --> 00:45:54,226
...and wishes it in the churchyard
and herself beside it.

421
00:45:54,386 --> 00:45:55,986
She loves that child of hers.

422
00:45:56,147 --> 00:46:00,067
Poor little mite.
It don't look long for this world.

423
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:29,593
Good evening, Durbeyfield.

424
00:46:29,753 --> 00:46:32,793
- What's your business?
- My business?

425
00:46:33,393 --> 00:46:37,233
The child. I must baptize it before
the Lord gathers it to his bosom.

426
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:38,954
What child are you speaking of?

427
00:46:39,114 --> 00:46:41,354
All my children are baptized.
You ought to know.

428
00:46:41,475 --> 00:46:43,875
Durbeyfield, don't play games
with the Almighty.

429
00:46:43,995 --> 00:46:45,515
I don't play, sir, I work!

430
00:46:45,676 --> 00:46:48,076
I work! Like a beast of the field.

431
00:46:48,395 --> 00:46:50,956
You can tell the Almighty that
from me.

432
00:46:52,677 --> 00:46:55,357
- My baby's dying.
- You ought to have been more careful.

433
00:46:55,518 --> 00:46:58,358
Like it or not, Jack,
that child was born.

434
00:46:58,518 --> 00:47:00,279
It is here, under your own roof.

435
00:47:00,398 --> 00:47:02,318
- Not true.
- Father, come to your senses.

436
00:47:02,439 --> 00:47:04,119
For pity's sake, let the vicar in!

437
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:06,199
He shan't set foot inside this house.

438
00:47:06,399 --> 00:47:08,960
Not over my dead body!

439
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,440
There's enough disgrace
on my name as it is.

440
00:47:14,601 --> 00:47:17,441
O merciful God, take pity.

441
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:19,681
Take pity on him.

442
00:47:20,122 --> 00:47:22,482
Send down your anger on me.

443
00:47:22,603 --> 00:47:25,123
But have mercy on my child.

444
00:47:25,443 --> 00:47:27,203
My child.

445
00:47:49,287 --> 00:47:52,288
I should like to ask you
something, sir.

446
00:47:52,447 --> 00:47:55,329
Well, speak, girl. I'm listening.

447
00:48:01,369 --> 00:48:04,411
Each of us shares
in your sad affliction, my child.

448
00:48:04,530 --> 00:48:07,371
We're all members
of the suffering body of Christ.

449
00:48:07,531 --> 00:48:09,331
My son was baptized.

450
00:48:09,451 --> 00:48:12,412
Baptized? By whom?

451
00:48:12,571 --> 00:48:15,372
By me, last night.

452
00:48:16,373 --> 00:48:18,733
What procedure did you follow?

453
00:48:20,533 --> 00:48:23,133
I woke my little brothers
and sisters...

454
00:48:23,414 --> 00:48:25,734
...and made them
kneel down to pray.

455
00:48:26,735 --> 00:48:30,695
'Liza-Lu held the prayer book open.

456
00:48:30,855 --> 00:48:32,336
I lit a candle.

457
00:48:32,495 --> 00:48:34,335
And then?

458
00:48:35,256 --> 00:48:40,616
Then I held my child like this
over the basin.

459
00:48:40,777 --> 00:48:42,017
Yes.

460
00:48:42,177 --> 00:48:44,978
I poured some water on his forehead,
and I said:

461
00:48:45,898 --> 00:48:47,659
"I baptize thee...

462
00:48:47,818 --> 00:48:51,659
...in the name of the Father,
Son and Holy Ghost."

463
00:48:53,619 --> 00:48:57,700
- Did you make the sign of the cross?
- Yes, I did that too.

464
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:02,261
Will it be just the same
as if you'd baptized him?

465
00:49:02,861 --> 00:49:04,941
In the sight of God, I mean.

466
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:07,662
Yes, my dear girl.
It will be the same.

467
00:49:08,102 --> 00:49:10,743
Then you'll give him
a Christian burial?

468
00:49:11,703 --> 00:49:14,223
That's another matter.

469
00:49:14,343 --> 00:49:16,583
Another matter? Why?

470
00:49:16,743 --> 00:49:19,944
Well, that would concern
the village as a whole.

471
00:49:20,104 --> 00:49:22,905
Not just the two of us,
you understand.

472
00:49:23,345 --> 00:49:25,425
Won't you do it, sir?

473
00:49:25,825 --> 00:49:27,825
Just this once?

474
00:49:27,985 --> 00:49:29,546
I'm sorry.

475
00:49:30,146 --> 00:49:32,546
I beg you, please.

476
00:49:32,987 --> 00:49:36,667
I told you.
It's out of the question.

477
00:49:39,147 --> 00:49:41,148
Then I don't like you.

478
00:49:42,109 --> 00:49:44,628
I shall never come
to your church again.

479
00:49:44,909 --> 00:49:46,069
Never.

480
00:49:46,229 --> 00:49:47,509
Never!

481
00:52:10,456 --> 00:52:13,776
- Hey, Mr. Crick.
- Eh?

482
00:52:16,696 --> 00:52:20,857
What, here already?
We didn't expect you afore tomorrow.

483
00:52:20,978 --> 00:52:23,218
It is quite a step from here
to Weatherbury.

484
00:52:23,338 --> 00:52:26,739
- Marlott, sir. I come from Marlott.
- Yes, Marlott.

485
00:52:27,099 --> 00:52:29,019
Well, that's even further.

486
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:32,100
Quite sure you can stand it here?

487
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:34,261
It is comfortable enough
for rough folk...

488
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:36,701
...but we don't live
in a cowcumber frame.

489
00:52:40,221 --> 00:52:41,822
I'm accustomed to that.

490
00:52:41,982 --> 00:52:45,343
I used to know your part
of the county when I were a lad.

491
00:52:45,622 --> 00:52:46,863
Good. Right you are.

492
00:52:47,142 --> 00:52:49,343
Well, you'll want a rest
and a morsel of food.

493
00:52:49,504 --> 00:52:52,183
I'd rather begin now,
to get my hand in.

494
00:52:52,344 --> 00:52:53,944
Oh, come on.
You must be famished.

495
00:52:54,144 --> 00:52:57,465
No, thank you.
A little milk will suffice.

496
00:53:00,225 --> 00:53:03,746
Well, if you can swallow that,
so be it.

497
00:53:06,026 --> 00:53:08,986
It is what I hain't touched for years.

498
00:53:12,827 --> 00:53:15,388
It lies in my innards like lead.

499
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:28,070
To my thinking, the beasts
aren't giving all they should.

500
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:30,711
That's because there's
a new hand come amongst us.

501
00:53:30,831 --> 00:53:32,511
I've known it happen afore.

502
00:53:32,671 --> 00:53:38,112
They do say that the milk goes up
into their horns at such times.

503
00:53:39,232 --> 00:53:41,993
Anyone would think we were
back in the Middle Ages.

504
00:53:44,193 --> 00:53:47,233
I don't appear to be making
much progress.

505
00:53:47,394 --> 00:53:50,195
Take it gentle, sir. Take it gentle.
Whoa, now.

506
00:53:50,514 --> 00:53:55,675
- It is skill that does it, not strength.
- So my aching fingers tell me.

507
00:54:12,238 --> 00:54:16,519
Mrs. Crick's too proud to come
milking with us, and that's a fact.

508
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,880
Still, there's little enough
to wherrit about.

509
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,720
And we do eat like gamecocks.

510
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,481
No, you'll like it here.

511
00:54:25,601 --> 00:54:29,001
Mr. Crick, he's a very kindly man.

512
00:54:29,362 --> 00:54:34,363
Just fancy. He has his own
family pew in church.

513
00:54:35,123 --> 00:54:41,084
Dairyman Dick all the week
On Sundays, Mr. Richard Crick

514
00:55:01,847 --> 00:55:04,088
Who's that playing?

515
00:55:04,688 --> 00:55:07,169
Mr. Clare.

516
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:10,290
Mr. Clare.

517
00:55:11,409 --> 00:55:14,170
Him that's learning to milk.

518
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:17,090
Angel Clare, he's called.

519
00:55:20,611 --> 00:55:22,731
Angel.

520
00:55:23,732 --> 00:55:25,613
It is no common name.

521
00:55:28,092 --> 00:55:32,093
He never says much to us,
more's the pity.

522
00:55:32,253 --> 00:55:34,054
Why?

523
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:37,014
Does he scorn common folk?

524
00:55:37,174 --> 00:55:43,136
Quite the opposite.
He often makes mock of old families.

525
00:55:43,455 --> 00:55:46,096
It is quite simple.

526
00:55:47,136 --> 00:55:51,897
He's a parson's son
with a mind to be a farmer.

527
00:55:52,697 --> 00:55:57,498
He's already tried his hand
at sheep farming.

528
00:55:58,178 --> 00:56:01,499
Now he's learning dairy work
with Mr. Crick.

529
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:08,700
But what does he hold against
old families?

530
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:12,741
He says they're...

531
00:56:16,421 --> 00:56:19,182
...worm-eaten.

532
00:58:15,324 --> 00:58:17,604
That be your soul trying to escape.

533
00:58:17,724 --> 00:58:20,564
It is bread, that's all.

534
00:58:20,925 --> 00:58:25,806
No, it is when you sneeze,
you're like to blow your soul away.

535
00:58:25,925 --> 00:58:29,966
As I see it, no soul can leave
its mortal shell afore a body dies.

536
00:58:30,086 --> 00:58:33,086
What if a man falls down
in a faint, Master Crick?

537
00:58:33,247 --> 00:58:35,368
Well, that's a different matter.

538
00:58:37,408 --> 00:58:42,369
The spirit bides there inside you,
but you cannot feel it.

539
00:58:43,169 --> 00:58:47,810
But we can sometimes make
our souls leave our bodies.

540
00:58:50,370 --> 00:58:52,610
How's that, then, maidy?

541
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,451
Only have to lie
on the grass at night...

542
00:58:56,611 --> 00:58:59,812
...and look straight up
at some bright star.

543
00:59:00,772 --> 00:59:04,653
And stare at it with all your might.

544
00:59:04,813 --> 00:59:09,333
And by and by, you'll feel
you're falling into the sky...

545
00:59:09,454 --> 00:59:12,414
...miles and miles from your body...

546
00:59:12,734 --> 00:59:15,775
...which you'll don't seem
to need at all.

547
01:00:08,025 --> 01:00:09,745
Tess!

548
01:00:10,625 --> 01:00:12,785
Why run away like that?

549
01:00:15,106 --> 01:00:19,586
- Are you afraid?
- No, sir. Not of outdoor things. No.

550
01:00:19,867 --> 01:00:23,308
- But you have your indoor fears, eh?
- Heavens, yes.

551
01:00:23,468 --> 01:00:25,267
Of what?

552
01:00:26,828 --> 01:00:27,988
I couldn't rightly say.

553
01:00:28,149 --> 01:00:30,589
Of the milk turning sour?

554
01:00:30,749 --> 01:00:32,029
No.

555
01:00:32,149 --> 01:00:34,869
Fear of life, in general?

556
01:00:35,789 --> 01:00:37,310
Yes, sir.

557
01:00:37,470 --> 01:00:40,111
So have I. Very often.

558
01:00:40,271 --> 01:00:43,191
Life's a puzzle. Don't you think?

559
01:00:44,312 --> 01:00:46,191
Perhaps...

560
01:00:46,432 --> 01:00:48,992
...now you put it that way.

561
01:01:02,234 --> 01:01:05,355
It is no use. It won't take.

562
01:01:06,235 --> 01:01:10,956
If this continues, I shall have
to call on Conjurer Trendle.

563
01:01:11,076 --> 01:01:13,077
I don't say I believe in him, mind.

564
01:01:13,237 --> 01:01:16,157
But if nothing else works,
I shall have to try it, shan't I?

565
01:01:16,318 --> 01:01:19,878
Somebody here's in love, I'll be bound.
That can cause it, so I've heard.

566
01:01:19,998 --> 01:01:23,359
Conjurer Fall,
to the side of Casterbridge.

567
01:01:23,519 --> 01:01:26,239
He had the knack of it
when I was a lad.

568
01:01:26,359 --> 01:01:29,480
It is a pity. He must be feeding
the worms by now.

569
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:34,041
My grandpa used to go to Conjurer
Mynterne out at Owlscombe.

570
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,121
But there's no folk
like him these days.

571
01:01:36,321 --> 01:01:39,041
Somebody's in love, I tell you.

572
01:01:40,962 --> 01:01:43,802
- What's the matter?
- The blasted butter won't come.

573
01:01:43,922 --> 01:01:45,362
- Why is that?
- To my mind...

574
01:01:45,482 --> 01:01:48,643
How warm it is today.

575
01:01:49,483 --> 01:01:52,604
I think I'd be better out-of-doors.

576
01:01:52,724 --> 01:01:56,325
They do say it happens
when people are in love.

577
01:01:56,484 --> 01:01:58,846
I remember as a girl...

578
01:02:21,770 --> 01:02:24,050
Don't push.

579
01:02:29,091 --> 01:02:31,891
He looks so sad.

580
01:02:34,492 --> 01:02:37,093
Whatever can he be thinking of?

581
01:02:37,213 --> 01:02:40,493
Well, not of us.
You can rely on that.

582
01:02:45,214 --> 01:02:48,014
You're a fine one to talk, lzz.

583
01:02:48,174 --> 01:02:51,655
- I saw you.
- What did you see?

584
01:02:52,015 --> 01:02:54,016
It was the other day.

585
01:02:54,136 --> 01:02:57,376
I saw you kissing his shadow.

586
01:03:01,777 --> 01:03:04,298
Here he comes again.

587
01:03:05,258 --> 01:03:07,058
Dear eyes...

588
01:03:09,339 --> 01:03:11,218
Dear face...

589
01:03:13,299 --> 01:03:15,740
Dear Mr. Clare.

590
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:22,220
It is terrible to think he'll never wed
any one of us.

591
01:03:24,502 --> 01:03:29,142
More likely, he'll ask us to milk
his cows for so much a year.

592
01:03:48,226 --> 01:03:49,465
What are we going to do?

593
01:03:49,626 --> 01:03:51,666
We shall have to take
the stone-bridge road.

594
01:03:51,986 --> 01:03:53,466
We'll be late.

595
01:04:24,152 --> 01:04:27,793
- Doesn't he go to church?
- No, never.

596
01:04:28,673 --> 01:04:30,553
I wish he would.

597
01:04:34,474 --> 01:04:36,435
You look like cats afraid of water.

598
01:04:36,555 --> 01:04:39,315
Only on account
of our Sunday best, sir.

599
01:04:39,475 --> 01:04:42,076
Very well. I'll carry you
just as you are.

600
01:04:42,196 --> 01:04:44,636
No, no, I'm far too heavy.

601
01:04:44,796 --> 01:04:47,196
Nonsense. I could carry
all four of you at once.

602
01:04:47,517 --> 01:04:49,837
Hold on to me. That's it.

603
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:06,480
I should put my arms around
his neck and look into his eyes.

604
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:08,880
There's nothing in that.

605
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:11,201
There's a time for everything
under heaven.

606
01:05:11,521 --> 01:05:14,361
A time to kiss and a time to cuddle.

607
01:05:14,481 --> 01:05:16,642
Shame on you, lzz.
That's scripture.

608
01:05:16,762 --> 01:05:19,922
I always heed the prettiest
verses in church.

609
01:06:08,211 --> 01:06:11,012
If you helped me, perhaps I could
climb along the bank.

610
01:06:14,893 --> 01:06:16,253
Tess.

611
01:06:16,373 --> 01:06:19,854
I've gone to three-quarters of this
trouble for your sake alone.

612
01:07:54,191 --> 01:07:57,992
She's angry. She doesn't understand.
She'll kick over the bucket.

613
01:07:58,152 --> 01:08:01,433
Forgive me, my darling Tess.
I don't know what came over me.

614
01:08:02,673 --> 01:08:05,273
There's only one excuse for it.

615
01:08:05,393 --> 01:08:07,554
I love you.

616
01:08:08,714 --> 01:08:11,875
Yes, I love you.

617
01:08:30,678 --> 01:08:32,118
Angel?

618
01:08:32,238 --> 01:08:33,399
Angel.

619
01:08:33,559 --> 01:08:37,079
Hello, Mercy. Forgive me.
I didn't see you.

620
01:08:37,239 --> 01:08:39,120
Forgive me.

621
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:40,680
Welcome home.

622
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:42,560
- How are you?
- Very well.

623
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:45,641
God be praised. You look radiant
with health, I see.

624
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:47,641
The open air, probably.

625
01:08:47,761 --> 01:08:49,801
Have you come to spend
the holidays with your brothers?

626
01:08:49,961 --> 01:08:52,242
Are they here? I had no idea.

627
01:08:52,362 --> 01:08:56,242
No, I'm only paying my parents a brief
visit to settle some urgent business.

628
01:08:56,403 --> 01:08:57,963
Then I won't detain you.

629
01:08:58,123 --> 01:09:01,843
I have my Bible class
to take, in any case.

630
01:09:02,004 --> 01:09:03,724
Au revoir, Angel.

631
01:09:25,328 --> 01:09:28,328
- Angel!
- Angel! My boy.

632
01:09:29,529 --> 01:09:32,650
I apologize, Father. I had no time
to warn you of my arrival.

633
01:09:32,770 --> 01:09:35,690
Perhaps you've forgotten how
to write. With a pen, remember?

634
01:09:35,810 --> 01:09:37,651
I brought you farmhouse delicacies.

635
01:09:37,770 --> 01:09:40,571
Black puddings
and a bottle of mead.

636
01:09:40,691 --> 01:09:42,771
Black puddings?

637
01:09:43,451 --> 01:09:45,532
It's true your mother and I
have regretted...

638
01:09:45,852 --> 01:09:47,772
...hearing so little of your news.

639
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:49,373
You must bear with him, Father.

640
01:09:49,493 --> 01:09:51,773
Spending all his time
with sheep and cattle...

641
01:09:51,933 --> 01:09:55,413
...takes one closer to nature
but further from Oxford.

642
01:09:55,534 --> 01:09:57,014
I would remind you, Felix...

643
01:09:57,334 --> 01:09:59,614
...that a university education
means nothing...

644
01:09:59,775 --> 01:10:01,895
...unless it redounds
to the glory of God.

645
01:10:02,175 --> 01:10:04,335
It can also redound
to the glory of man.

646
01:10:04,495 --> 01:10:06,615
Only in the second place.

647
01:10:06,936 --> 01:10:08,456
How far are you
in your apprenticeship?

648
01:10:08,576 --> 01:10:11,137
It's drawing to a close.

649
01:10:14,137 --> 01:10:17,017
What counts is spiritual cleanliness.
Isn't that so, Father?

650
01:10:17,218 --> 01:10:19,458
The two go together, my boy.

651
01:10:19,618 --> 01:10:21,938
Father tells us you intend
setting up on your own.

652
01:10:22,059 --> 01:10:23,339
Yes.

653
01:10:23,459 --> 01:10:25,700
- In what part of the world?
- I don't know yet.

654
01:10:25,859 --> 01:10:27,780
The colonies perhaps.

655
01:10:28,060 --> 01:10:29,380
Heaven preserve us.

656
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:31,981
It would suit the type of
farming I have in mind.

657
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:34,861
- What colony?
- The choice is wide.

658
01:10:34,981 --> 01:10:36,782
Or I may settle in a foreign country.

659
01:10:36,942 --> 01:10:40,262
Some places offer land to immigrants
on very favorable terms.

660
01:10:40,582 --> 01:10:42,463
Brazil, for example.

661
01:10:42,622 --> 01:10:45,103
Wonders will never cease.

662
01:10:46,343 --> 01:10:49,304
Nothing's settled yet.
I came here to discuss it.

663
01:10:49,424 --> 01:10:51,224
That among other things.

664
01:10:51,345 --> 01:10:55,385
Shall we take a drop of good
Mrs. Crick's delicious mead?

665
01:10:58,061 --> 01:10:59,393
Oh forgive me . I forgot.

666
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:01,727
Strong drink is the root of all evil.

667
01:11:12,044 --> 01:11:13,136
Take us into your confidence.

668
01:11:13,714 --> 01:11:14,737
Is it something serious?

669
01:11:15,515 --> 01:11:19,248
Not serious, but something
important. The truth is

670
01:11:21,255 --> 01:11:23,281
son't you think it's time
i considered marrying?

671
01:11:24,093 --> 01:11:26,060
Yes indeed my boy, yes indeed.

672
01:11:26,362 --> 01:11:28,489
Your mother and I have sometimes
debated the same question.

673
01:11:28,764 --> 01:11:29,458
Really?

674
01:11:29,866 --> 01:11:30,889
And what sort of wife would you favour

675
01:11:31,301 --> 01:11:33,030
for a budding farmer like myself?

676
01:11:33,336 --> 01:11:35,201
Truly christian, god-fearing woman.

677
01:11:35,505 --> 01:11:38,475
One who will be of help and
a comfort to you in all things.

678
01:11:38,976 --> 01:11:40,034
The rest matters little.

679
01:11:40,278 --> 01:11:41,905
You musn't hesitate, dear son.

680
01:11:43,048 --> 01:11:43,776
Why hesitate?

681
01:11:44,316 --> 01:11:46,944
To marry your heart's desire.
Mercy Chant.

682
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:51,584
She may be fond of over-
decorating the church and

683
01:11:52,026 --> 01:11:54,620
flipparies and flowers,
scraps of lacys and so forth but

684
01:11:55,596 --> 01:11:57,496
It's merely a girl's fancies. It will pass.

685
01:11:58,233 --> 01:12:00,098
Mercy's a pure and virtuous girl.

686
01:12:00,368 --> 01:12:02,336
Oh yes I know she's pure and virtuous.

687
01:12:03,672 --> 01:12:07,006
But honesty compels me to
inform you that I have other plans.

688
01:12:08,078 --> 01:12:08,703
Other plans?

689
01:12:08,946 --> 01:12:09,742
Very much sir.

690
01:12:10,247 --> 01:12:12,477
Mercy Chant appeals more
to you than she does to me.

691
01:12:12,984 --> 01:12:16,316
I'm not disputing her merits
I'm only speaking of my own inclinations.

692
01:12:16,621 --> 01:12:17,519
My dearest boy.

693
01:12:18,022 --> 01:12:21,220
Angel.Please remember that
you are addressing your parents.

694
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:22,188
I'm aware of that.

695
01:12:23,696 --> 01:12:25,665
I already know the woman I intend to marry.

696
01:12:26,533 --> 01:12:28,558
Her name is Teresa Durbeyfield.

697
01:12:31,772 --> 01:12:34,332
Father, Mother. I respect you both.

698
01:12:35,210 --> 01:12:37,678
I also respect Mercy Chant.
And have no doubt

699
01:12:37,913 --> 01:12:39,608
she'll find worthier husband with or

700
01:12:39,815 --> 01:12:44,879
without your help. As for me,
my mind is made up.

701
01:13:22,232 --> 01:13:22,994
Oh it's you...

702
01:13:23,233 --> 01:13:25,634
Tess, I want to ask you this now.

703
01:13:28,539 --> 01:13:29,335
Will you be my wife?

704
01:13:31,476 --> 01:13:33,535
I love you with all my heart and soul.

705
01:13:42,890 --> 01:13:44,859
I can not be your wife.

706
01:13:46,528 --> 01:13:47,290
Don't you love me?

707
01:13:47,962 --> 01:13:49,327
Oh yes yes...

708
01:13:50,332 --> 01:13:53,268
I'd rather belong to you
than anyone in the world.

709
01:13:54,437 --> 01:13:59,933
Forgive me. I can't marry you.

710
01:14:33,016 --> 01:14:36,417
It was the good lord who put
this nice young person's in your way.

711
01:14:36,687 --> 01:14:37,779
You must believe that.

712
01:14:38,355 --> 01:14:42,383
But with respects to your question,
I tell you quite private but

713
01:14:42,594 --> 01:14:46,894
very strong. On no accounts,
say a word about your bygone trouble.

714
01:14:47,566 --> 01:14:50,798
Never a word, my girl. Least of all to him.

715
01:14:58,946 --> 01:15:02,075
Tess. Why does the idea of
becoming my wife displease you?

716
01:15:02,216 --> 01:15:06,347
I never said that. It would please me so much.

717
01:15:08,892 --> 01:15:10,690
It's simply that I can not.

718
01:15:10,861 --> 01:15:13,830
Why? Is there someone else?

719
01:15:17,235 --> 01:15:18,668
Don't i deserve to know the truth?

720
01:15:20,772 --> 01:15:21,431
Well?

721
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:22,968
Not now

722
01:15:23,476 --> 01:15:24,170
When then?

723
01:15:24,610 --> 01:15:25,372
Later.

724
01:15:25,578 --> 01:15:26,237
But why?

725
01:15:29,583 --> 01:15:31,346
I'll tell you when we get home.

726
01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:34,411
You'll stop loving
me when you know.

727
01:15:36,392 --> 01:15:38,154
Let me wait till then.

728
01:16:06,494 --> 01:16:09,225
Londoners will drink it at
their breakfast tomorrow, won't they?

729
01:16:09,396 --> 01:16:11,729
Yes but watered down,
in case it goes to their heads.

730
01:16:12,167 --> 01:16:14,102
Strangers that we have never seen.

731
01:16:25,682 --> 01:16:27,412
You saw me once before.
you know that?

732
01:16:28,019 --> 01:16:28,542
I did?

733
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:31,047
You wouldn't dance with me.

734
01:16:32,358 --> 01:16:33,290
It was at Marlott.

735
01:16:33,792 --> 01:16:34,554
Of course!

736
01:16:36,595 --> 01:16:37,824
That's incredible!

737
01:16:37,998 --> 01:16:38,794
You remember now?

738
01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:40,666
Tessy!Tessy!

739
01:16:44,472 --> 01:16:45,234
Now my girl.

740
01:16:45,873 --> 01:16:51,210
Yes. I may never again be
brave enough to tell my story.

741
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:53,004
Then get on with your precious story.

742
01:16:53,615 --> 01:16:55,982
I was born at such and such place
and in such and such a year...

743
01:16:56,219 --> 01:17:00,019
I was born at Marlott and i grew up there.

744
01:17:01,458 --> 01:17:03,926
I was in the Sixth Form when I left school.

745
01:17:05,130 --> 01:17:06,859
They said that I would make a geed teacher.

746
01:17:10,202 --> 01:17:11,794
But there was trouble in my family.

747
01:17:14,007 --> 01:17:16,601
Father was no great worker.

748
01:17:17,878 --> 01:17:22,509
He drank. Anyway, my parents, they...

749
01:17:24,453 --> 01:17:26,511
it was then that something happened.

750
01:17:27,990 --> 01:17:30,390
Something which changed my life like.

751
01:17:34,631 --> 01:17:41,094
They discovered
that we were not Durbeyfields

752
01:17:41,639 --> 01:17:42,766
but D'Urbervilles.

753
01:17:44,576 --> 01:17:45,702
WEll, go on.

754
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:48,579
WEll, that's it.

755
01:17:49,983 --> 01:17:54,011
WEll the D'Urbervilles are an old family.

756
01:17:55,189 --> 01:17:55,815
I know

757
01:17:59,594 --> 01:18:04,897
On account of being of that
name my mother thought that...

758
01:18:08,170 --> 01:18:09,365
I was sent...

759
01:18:14,178 --> 01:18:16,271
-I had a...
-A what?

760
01:18:17,515 --> 01:18:19,176
I was told that you hated old families.

761
01:18:21,654 --> 01:18:22,586
Is that all the trouble?

762
01:18:24,457 --> 01:18:27,858
None of that matters, Tess. Say you'll be my wife.

763
01:18:28,795 --> 01:18:31,890
Say it, Tess. SAy it, my dear love!

764
01:18:34,169 --> 01:18:36,694
Yes yes yes...

765
01:18:45,548 --> 01:18:47,982
my health, my simplicity.

766
01:18:49,086 --> 01:18:51,384
I'm a strangeness of my situation.

767
01:18:52,122 --> 01:18:53,784
I perhaps lessen my fault.

768
01:18:58,664 --> 01:19:02,123
But since I've committed it I am guilty.

769
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:07,801
I must be guilty.

770
01:19:08,775 --> 01:19:11,574
Because the lord sawfit to take my child.

771
01:19:14,449 --> 01:19:19,387
If what I have just written,
failed to pass my lips,

772
01:19:20,022 --> 01:19:24,654
in your presence, then I have
repeated it a thousand times

773
01:19:24,861 --> 01:19:30,893
in my heart. For it was the
fear of losing you forever.

774
01:19:34,773 --> 01:19:36,104
For love of you,

775
01:19:37,076 --> 01:19:41,138
Is hall conquer that fear
and bring you this letter

776
01:19:43,617 --> 01:19:45,483
Once you are savoured Angel

777
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:49,686
you'll hold the rest
of my life in your hands.

778
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:57,599
I hope and I tremble. I love you.

779
01:20:36,045 --> 01:20:36,808
Oh darling!

780
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:49,220
I've been assumed to put
an edge on my appetite.

781
01:20:51,397 --> 01:20:52,592
I'm starving.

782
01:23:53,729 --> 01:23:54,660
Angel.

783
01:23:55,298 --> 01:23:57,095
Angel please.
I must speak to you.

784
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:58,091
What's the matter?

785
01:23:58,435 --> 01:24:02,371
I want to confess all my past faults, all of it!

786
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:04,965
Later Sweetheart.Once we are married,

787
01:24:05,276 --> 01:24:06,436
we'll tell each other everything.

788
01:24:06,911 --> 01:24:09,141
I have some failings of my own to confess!

789
01:24:19,726 --> 01:24:21,592
I required and charge you both

790
01:24:22,196 --> 01:24:25,859
as you all have to answer
at that dreadful day of judgement.

791
01:24:26,667 --> 01:24:29,398
Let the secrets of all
hearts should be disclosed.

792
01:24:30,238 --> 01:24:32,070
If either of you know any impediments

793
01:24:32,608 --> 01:24:35,702
why you may not be
lawfully joined in matrimony,

794
01:24:36,312 --> 01:24:37,837
Ye do now confess.

795
01:24:42,987 --> 01:24:46,081
Will thou have this woman
for thou wedded wife

796
01:24:46,925 --> 01:24:47,790
To live together after
god's just ordinance

797
01:24:48,293 --> 01:24:50,728
In the holiest state of matrimony,

798
01:24:51,497 --> 01:24:54,763
will thou love her, comfort her,
honour and keep her in sickness

799
01:24:55,202 --> 01:24:59,299
and in health and forsaking
all other, keep thee only unto her,

800
01:24:59,974 --> 01:25:01,202
so long as ye both shall live?

801
01:25:02,076 --> 01:25:02,804
I will.

802
01:25:19,865 --> 01:25:22,493
Welcome sir, welcome ma'am.

803
01:25:23,336 --> 01:25:25,929
Mr Plunkit told me to make ye at home.

804
01:25:26,539 --> 01:25:29,031
The rooms, they are ready.
They are on the first floor.

805
01:25:29,375 --> 01:25:33,210
Mr Plunkit had to leave for Manchester
so you'll have the whole house

806
01:25:33,580 --> 01:25:38,245
to yourselves. I hope you
are very comfortable here.

807
01:25:38,586 --> 01:25:41,852
The house is inclined to be
damp but I put a good fire

808
01:25:42,158 --> 01:25:45,150
in the drawing room and
leave it the afternoon.

809
01:25:45,394 --> 01:25:49,833
As for food, look, I've prepared
you a cold supper and maybe

810
01:25:50,066 --> 01:25:52,035
there's a nice bottle of wine to go with it!

811
01:25:52,937 --> 01:25:56,737
Tomorrow, if you wish, I'll
bring you some of my husband's

812
01:25:57,308 --> 01:25:59,834
excellent cider. He makes it himself.

813
01:26:02,147 --> 01:26:05,117
Oh... oh... to use your ups...

814
01:26:08,189 --> 01:26:10,054
The... bedroom!

815
01:26:14,563 --> 01:26:16,327
A bit of surprise, love.

816
01:26:17,432 --> 01:26:19,059
I've totally prepared...

817
01:26:19,402 --> 01:26:20,596
my son picked it in the bush.

818
01:26:21,237 --> 01:26:22,762
Oh... it's a good bed.

819
01:26:23,239 --> 01:26:25,640
I think you'll find that you like it.

820
01:26:26,610 --> 01:26:28,374
now i'll leave you to yourselves.

821
01:26:29,013 --> 01:26:29,877
cheerio

822
01:26:37,990 --> 01:26:40,084
Which are my hands and which are yours?

823
01:26:41,528 --> 01:26:43,052
They are all yours.

824
01:27:11,062 --> 01:27:13,793
Open it. It's for you.

825
01:27:29,450 --> 01:27:30,475
Family jewels.

826
01:27:32,521 --> 01:27:33,351
Is this for me?

827
01:27:34,056 --> 01:27:34,682
Of course.

828
01:27:36,826 --> 01:27:37,656
Truly?

829
01:27:40,131 --> 01:27:43,533
Put them on. Put them on now.

830
01:28:28,989 --> 01:28:30,855
Oh god, how beautiful you are.

831
01:28:33,426 --> 01:28:34,325
Come and see.

832
01:28:53,717 --> 01:28:55,413
I have a confession to make my love.

833
01:28:59,357 --> 01:29:00,585
You have something to confess?

834
01:29:00,993 --> 01:29:04,087
Why not? You think far too highly of me.

835
01:29:05,232 --> 01:29:08,395
Now listen. I want you to forgive me.

836
01:29:09,403 --> 01:29:12,339
And not be angry with me
for failing to tell you earlier.

837
01:29:13,641 --> 01:29:15,302
This is nothing for fear of losing you.

838
01:29:18,414 --> 01:29:19,472
I shall be brief.

839
01:29:31,563 --> 01:29:35,294
Not long before we met,
I lived in London for a time.

840
01:29:36,802 --> 01:29:43,208
There, I met a woman older
than myself. Ours was a flase

841
01:29:43,711 --> 01:29:50,311
relationship. A sad one.
It was all over in a few weeks.

842
01:29:56,058 --> 01:29:57,356
That's all there is to tell.

843
01:29:59,995 --> 01:30:00,860
Do you forgive me?

844
01:30:02,232 --> 01:30:05,669
Angel, oh, Angel.

845
01:30:07,672 --> 01:30:09,106
You are so utterly good and gentle

846
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:10,669
I was mad to fear you'll hate me.

847
01:30:11,643 --> 01:30:14,612
I have a confession too Angel.
Something of a same kind.

848
01:30:14,781 --> 01:30:16,271
Well, tell me at table. WE'll talk over supper.

849
01:30:16,516 --> 01:30:17,244
I'm hungry, aren't you?

850
01:30:17,817 --> 01:30:21,480
I told you. I have a confession like your own.

851
01:30:22,288 --> 01:30:23,483
What confession?

852
01:30:25,861 --> 01:30:26,987
I shall be just as brief.

853
01:30:36,973 --> 01:30:40,239
His name is D'Urberville like mine.

854
01:30:41,845 --> 01:30:43,279
Alexander D'Urberville.

855
01:30:46,684 --> 01:30:48,652
His family bought the title.

856
01:30:49,855 --> 01:30:51,619
Their real name is Stoke.

857
01:30:57,063 --> 01:30:59,760
It was fate that drove me to work

858
01:31:00,334 --> 01:31:04,203
for false relations as a way of
hoping my own folk to live.

859
01:31:07,209 --> 01:31:13,343
Alec, Alexander took advantage of me.

860
01:31:15,519 --> 01:31:18,079
Lioness strengh... my defeat.

861
01:31:21,693 --> 01:31:25,892
I became his mistress
and his affaire without love.

862
01:31:28,935 --> 01:31:34,876
Like yours, my sad union
ended after a few weeks.

863
01:31:36,277 --> 01:31:43,309
We bore a child which died very young.

864
01:31:47,289 --> 01:31:49,656
My life was a ruins until the day I met you.

865
01:32:30,341 --> 01:32:31,103
I'm going out.

866
01:33:23,470 --> 01:33:25,871
If you don't forgive me......

867
01:33:29,211 --> 01:33:30,438
but I forgive you, Angel.

868
01:33:30,646 --> 01:33:31,271
Yes, I know.

869
01:33:34,150 --> 01:33:38,052
But you.... you don't forgive me?

870
01:33:39,056 --> 01:33:40,751
You were one person, now you are another.

871
01:33:43,561 --> 01:33:44,357
I have mercy.

872
01:33:48,701 --> 01:33:49,429
I have mercy.

873
01:33:50,336 --> 01:33:51,735
Angel, what do you mean by that laugh?

874
01:33:54,807 --> 01:33:56,240
How can you speak to me like this?

875
01:33:56,577 --> 01:33:59,239
It frightens me. How can you?

876
01:33:59,480 --> 01:34:00,539
You are not the woman I loved.

877
01:34:02,384 --> 01:34:03,316
Well, who am I then?

878
01:34:03,685 --> 01:34:05,346
Another woman in her shape.

879
01:34:10,092 --> 01:34:13,027
It is not the woman I love... but

880
01:34:14,264 --> 01:34:16,095
another woman in her shape.

881
01:34:21,372 --> 01:34:22,931
Angel, Angel, please.

882
01:34:23,175 --> 01:34:24,938
I was a child, a child when it happened.

883
01:34:25,244 --> 01:34:26,575
I... I knew nothing of men.

884
01:34:26,945 --> 01:34:28,538
You were sinned against. That I grant you.

885
01:34:31,218 --> 01:34:32,878
So you don't forgive me.

886
01:34:33,086 --> 01:34:35,715
I forgive you, but forgiveness isn't all.

887
01:34:37,592 --> 01:34:38,923
You don't love me.

888
01:34:39,961 --> 01:34:41,360
I can not help associating your lack

889
01:34:41,563 --> 01:34:43,292
of firmness with thedecline of your family.

890
01:34:44,266 --> 01:34:45,427
Decrepid families imply indeficient

891
01:34:45,668 --> 01:34:47,363
will-power and indecadent conduct.

892
01:34:47,804 --> 01:34:49,704
I thought you were a child of nature.

893
01:34:50,374 --> 01:34:51,568
But you are the last in the line

894
01:34:51,742 --> 01:34:52,801
of degenerate aristocrats.

895
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:33,290
Breakfast is ready.

896
01:37:14,478 --> 01:37:15,410
You can get rid of me.

897
01:37:18,282 --> 01:37:19,307
What did you say?

898
01:37:22,020 --> 01:37:23,078
You can get rid of me.

899
01:37:25,591 --> 01:37:26,648
You won't see me.

900
01:37:28,996 --> 01:37:29,393
Good god.

901
01:37:32,966 --> 01:37:34,433
How can you be so simple?

902
01:37:35,602 --> 01:37:40,063
You are too much of a child.
Too immature.

903
01:37:40,943 --> 01:37:42,170
Too ignorant I suppose.

904
01:37:52,555 --> 01:37:54,022
Leave that!

905
01:37:54,825 --> 01:37:56,259
You are my wife, not my servant.

906
01:38:01,433 --> 01:38:07,168
I am your wife but you
don't want to live with me.

907
01:38:09,643 --> 01:38:11,668
You are going to go, aren't you?

908
01:38:12,780 --> 01:38:14,510
I couldn't stay without despising myself

909
01:38:16,651 --> 01:38:18,346
which is worse than despising you.

910
01:38:20,823 --> 01:38:23,986
How can we live together
while that man exists?

911
01:38:24,728 --> 01:38:29,188
He is your natural husband. Not I.

912
01:38:38,977 --> 01:38:41,946
Can you honestly tell me to stay?

913
01:38:44,318 --> 01:38:46,012
No.

914
01:38:57,934 --> 01:39:00,232
But it's absolutely necessary
that one of us remain here

915
01:39:01,772 --> 01:39:03,399
to avoid a scandal.

916
01:39:05,877 --> 01:39:08,141
We must at least keep up appearances.

917
01:39:10,315 --> 01:39:11,373
Oh yes we must.

918
01:39:15,588 --> 01:39:16,748
What will you do?

919
01:39:20,660 --> 01:39:21,718
I can go home.

920
01:39:22,563 --> 01:39:23,495
You sure?

921
01:39:26,735 --> 01:39:29,602
If you leave me, I shall go home.

922
01:39:31,407 --> 01:39:32,237
Certainly.

923
01:40:00,774 --> 01:40:02,264
Cross-in-hands, sir.

924
01:40:02,410 --> 01:40:03,308
Yes I know.

925
01:40:03,778 --> 01:40:05,336
Come

926
01:40:17,260 --> 01:40:18,660
Now let's be clear about this.

927
01:40:19,297 --> 01:40:20,958
There's no anger in our hearts.

928
01:40:21,566 --> 01:40:22,897
Even though something
has happened between us

929
01:40:23,134 --> 01:40:24,329
which I cannot endure at present.

930
01:40:25,003 --> 01:40:26,163
I shall let you know where I go

931
01:40:27,306 --> 01:40:28,797
and if I think i can
bare it, if I'm capable of it,

932
01:40:29,008 --> 01:40:31,135
I shall come to fetch you.

933
01:40:31,644 --> 01:40:32,770
I shall wait.

934
01:40:33,681 --> 01:40:36,013
Until then, you'd do better
not to try and join me.

935
01:40:38,085 --> 01:40:40,748
Until then, I must not join you.

936
01:40:45,828 --> 01:40:48,092
May I write to you?

937
01:40:48,264 --> 01:40:50,790
Oh yes. If you are ill
or in need of anything.

938
01:41:29,113 --> 01:41:31,479
Ha very good day to you Mr Clare.

939
01:41:31,982 --> 01:41:33,506
I've brought you some groceries.

940
01:41:33,818 --> 01:41:36,413
There is some chicken,
come sausages and bacon.

941
01:41:36,721 --> 01:41:37,346
Thank you, thank you so much.

942
01:41:37,556 --> 01:41:39,889
I've also brought you some butter,
some flour, a dozen eggs

943
01:41:40,126 --> 01:41:41,093
But that's far too much.

944
01:41:41,295 --> 01:41:43,023
Newly-weds are always hungry sir!

945
01:41:43,963 --> 01:41:46,694
From tonight onwards,
I shall cook for you myself.

946
01:41:46,967 --> 01:41:49,732
The truth is, you see, for sometime
I shall be needing less than

947
01:41:50,038 --> 01:41:53,064
that, because, infact,
I shall be alone for a day or two.

948
01:41:53,208 --> 01:41:55,107
My wife has been obliged
to rejoin her parents.

949
01:41:55,311 --> 01:41:57,643
Was there any illness in the family?

950
01:41:57,813 --> 01:41:59,940
No no nothing of that kind.
It was all arranged beforehand.

951
01:42:00,183 --> 01:42:02,083
So as far as all my meals
are concerned during Mrs. Clare's

952
01:42:02,319 --> 01:42:04,583
absence, I'll talk of that later.

953
01:42:04,754 --> 01:42:06,518
Well shall... shall I leave the basket?

954
01:42:06,591 --> 01:42:08,149
Yes, indeed... the basket'll do for the day.

955
01:43:15,639 --> 01:43:17,698
I was passing on my way home sir.

956
01:43:18,375 --> 01:43:20,206
WE wanted to wish you well.

957
01:43:20,478 --> 01:43:22,105
You and Mrs. Clare.

958
01:43:22,312 --> 01:43:23,371
She's not here.

959
01:43:23,715 --> 01:43:25,308
I'm on the point of leaving
myself as you see.

960
01:43:26,317 --> 01:43:27,012
I'm leaving England.

961
01:43:27,286 --> 01:43:28,548
I've made up my mind to go to Brazil.

962
01:43:29,088 --> 01:43:33,389
Brazil? I am pleased.Tell Mrs Clare,

963
01:43:34,261 --> 01:43:35,786
I hope the journey agrees with her.

964
01:43:36,063 --> 01:43:36,961
She will not be leaving for the present.

965
01:43:37,165 --> 01:43:37,927
I'm going on ahead to get

966
01:43:38,132 --> 01:43:40,066
the measure of the place and
see what life there is like.

967
01:43:53,683 --> 01:43:54,878
How's Retty?

968
01:43:55,352 --> 01:43:56,819
Good. REtty's as strong as ever.

969
01:43:58,724 --> 01:43:59,315
And Marian?

970
01:44:00,292 --> 01:44:01,919
Marianne's taken to drinks sir.

971
01:44:02,294 --> 01:44:02,818
Really?

972
01:44:03,095 --> 01:44:05,189
Yes.Mr Crick's got rid of her.

973
01:44:06,265 --> 01:44:08,461
And you lzz. Are you well?

974
01:44:11,004 --> 01:44:13,405
With you gone sir, how could we be?

975
01:44:16,511 --> 01:44:18,173
There... tis said.

976
01:44:20,148 --> 01:44:21,013
Bye sir.

977
01:44:25,721 --> 01:44:26,380
Goodbye lzz.

978
01:44:45,678 --> 01:44:46,474
Izz!

979
01:45:07,071 --> 01:45:08,867
If I was to ask you to
come with me now,

980
01:45:10,441 --> 01:45:11,499
Come to Brazil with me,

981
01:45:12,578 --> 01:45:13,566
would your answer be yes?

982
01:45:15,314 --> 01:45:18,442
To come with you I should
leave everything this minute.

983
01:45:18,819 --> 01:45:21,515
You know what it will mean
in the eyes of the society.

984
01:45:21,822 --> 01:45:23,051
I wouldn't care.

985
01:45:23,490 --> 01:45:24,321
Do you love me so much?

986
01:45:25,526 --> 01:45:27,460
I've always loved you.

987
01:45:27,830 --> 01:45:29,320
More than Tess.

988
01:45:35,505 --> 01:45:39,271
No. Not more than her.

989
01:45:42,112 --> 01:45:44,012
Nobody could have
loved you more than Tess.

990
01:45:46,450 --> 01:45:47,974
She would have given her life for you.

991
01:45:49,821 --> 01:45:51,016
I could do no more.

992
01:48:38,155 --> 01:48:39,588
Oh... it's vanity.

993
01:49:22,190 --> 01:49:22,990
Good night my pretty.

994
01:49:23,030 --> 01:49:24,470
Good night sir.

995
01:49:25,711 --> 01:49:28,991
It is late for a maid to be roaming
around the mane by herself.

996
01:49:30,192 --> 01:49:32,392
Have you lost your way then?

997
01:49:34,394 --> 01:49:37,635
Step up here beside me and
I'll take you a part of the road.

998
01:49:40,036 --> 01:49:43,037
for you scarce put one
foot in front of the other.

999
01:49:43,678 --> 01:49:45,759
Ride with me I say.

1000
01:49:50,040 --> 01:49:52,600
Ah? But I know you.

1001
01:49:54,402 --> 01:49:57,322
You are that Mr Stokes-
D'Uberville's fancy woman.

1002
01:49:58,083 --> 01:50:02,084
You weren't too proud
to cock-a-leg for Groby.

1003
01:50:05,606 --> 01:50:07,286
Trollop!

1004
01:50:24,013 --> 01:50:25,574
If it isn't my little Tess.

1005
01:50:32,617 --> 01:50:35,817
Oh poor poppet. What a state you are in.

1006
01:50:37,499 --> 01:50:39,420
You are so cold!

1007
01:50:45,141 --> 01:50:48,062
Here. Get that inside you

1008
01:50:48,663 --> 01:50:49,983
This will warm your bones

1009
01:50:52,665 --> 01:50:54,345
Go on my love. Drink it.

1010
01:51:04,348 --> 01:51:05,349
Get it out

1011
01:51:06,671 --> 01:51:08,550
You mustn't let yourself go.

1012
01:51:08,751 --> 01:51:10,671
Even bad luck runs out in the end.

1013
01:51:11,271 --> 01:51:12,511
Take my word for it.

1014
01:51:13,232 --> 01:51:14,433
I can't go on.

1015
01:51:14,953 --> 01:51:16,673
You'll feel better tomorrow.

1016
01:51:17,114 --> 01:51:21,595
OH no. I can't go on. My life...

1017
01:51:24,757 --> 01:51:27,597
If I had the courage, I'd like to die.

1018
01:51:28,279 --> 01:51:30,479
Don't talk such flubbery.

1019
01:51:31,599 --> 01:51:33,600
Why didn't you come and see me sooner?

1020
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:36,400
Eh? I could have taken you in here, my girl.

1021
01:51:36,842 --> 01:51:37,722
Is there still some work here.

1022
01:51:38,042 --> 01:51:39,802
In this wretched place?

1023
01:51:41,003 --> 01:51:43,843
There's always work here.

1024
01:51:53,808 --> 01:51:56,329
Come... have some
of my nice soup.

1025
01:52:02,131 --> 01:52:06,052
After that, we must
take off those slum,

1026
01:52:06,574 --> 01:52:10,054
mirky clothes and
prettify yourself. Eh?

1027
01:52:17,138 --> 01:52:19,898
Just to make me jealous again, hey?

1028
01:52:22,620 --> 01:52:23,659
WEll, Tessy.

1029
01:53:42,970 --> 01:53:43,970
Are you the new hand?

1030
01:53:53,215 --> 01:53:55,615
T'was you was it?

1031
01:53:58,736 --> 01:54:00,217
Is that all you've done?

1032
01:54:01,057 --> 01:54:02,537
T'is a mighty poor show.

1033
01:54:03,058 --> 01:54:04,538
She's not accustomed to it.

1034
01:54:04,698 --> 01:54:06,218
I don't keep useless hands here.

1035
01:54:06,740 --> 01:54:07,940
I'm not payed for what we do.

1036
01:54:08,220 --> 01:54:09,580
So where's the difference?

1037
01:54:09,740 --> 01:54:10,500
No arguing.

1038
01:54:10,701 --> 01:54:12,021
I want the whole lot cleared.

1039
01:54:12,621 --> 01:54:13,262
Well, it's too late.

1040
01:54:14,742 --> 01:54:15,862
You'd better.

1041
01:54:24,386 --> 01:54:25,826
Now, you not mind Groby.

1042
01:54:27,147 --> 01:54:28,188
T'is just as well.

1043
01:54:28,707 --> 01:54:30,148
Ah... I know lord loves us.

1044
01:54:30,708 --> 01:54:32,148
but it's not like it was at the dairy.

1045
01:54:32,829 --> 01:54:34,550
Dairyman on the deck all the week,

1046
01:54:35,430 --> 01:54:37,310
On Sundays he's the Mr Richard Crick!

1047
01:55:37,135 --> 01:55:39,094
It don't do to pray here missy.

1048
01:55:43,216 --> 01:55:44,897
There's been a curse on this place.

1049
01:55:47,378 --> 01:55:48,939
This is the Cross-in-hand, isn't it?

1050
01:55:49,139 --> 01:55:50,258
Aye. So it is.

1051
01:55:51,860 --> 01:55:54,781
On the count of a malefactor
they tortured here, in ancient times

1052
01:55:55,020 --> 01:56:00,143
they did nail his hand onto the
post and then they hangged him.

1053
01:56:01,424 --> 01:56:05,105
The bones are down
there to this day I'm told.

1054
01:58:45,967 --> 01:58:46,927
OH!

1055
01:58:49,848 --> 01:58:50,688
What have you found?

1056
01:58:51,530 --> 01:58:53,250
An old pair of boots.

1057
01:58:59,292 --> 01:59:00,693
STill in good condition.

1058
01:59:04,574 --> 01:59:06,054
Could be of use to the poor.

1059
02:00:01,396 --> 02:00:03,036
There! Have a look.

1060
02:00:52,216 --> 02:00:54,377
I knew nothing of your circumstances.

1061
02:00:54,736 --> 02:00:57,617
Nothing at all until your mother wrote to me.

1062
02:00:57,818 --> 02:00:58,498
My mother?

1063
02:00:58,738 --> 02:01:01,778
She wrote what you should
have told me a long time ago.

1064
02:01:03,420 --> 02:01:04,460
I came at once.

1065
02:01:07,022 --> 02:01:07,862
Tess...

1066
02:01:16,546 --> 02:01:17,906
Why did you never say anything?

1067
02:01:18,346 --> 02:01:19,987
I had nothing to ask of you.

1068
02:01:21,266 --> 02:01:22,147
That isn't so.

1069
02:01:23,788 --> 02:01:27,269
You wear your ridiculous pride like a h

1070
02:01:28,070 --> 02:01:30,511
And you put me even more
in the wrong than I was!

1071
02:01:31,430 --> 02:01:32,510
Against my will

1072
02:01:34,032 --> 02:01:36,113
I have done my duty for my child.

1073
02:01:37,393 --> 02:01:38,713
On my honour i did it.

1074
02:01:39,393 --> 02:01:40,474
honour...

1075
02:01:42,396 --> 02:01:44,676
I want to take you away
from this wretched place.

1076
02:01:45,035 --> 02:01:46,076
Somewhere you're worthy of.

1077
02:01:47,238 --> 02:01:51,518
What is this strange temptation
that misery holds for you?

1078
02:01:52,399 --> 02:01:54,119
Come to your senses.

1079
02:01:54,920 --> 02:01:55,960
Come away with me.

1080
02:02:01,402 --> 02:02:02,322
your father's ill.

1081
02:02:02,443 --> 02:02:03,204
Did you know?

1082
02:02:04,163 --> 02:02:04,804
yes...

1083
02:02:05,644 --> 02:02:07,604
they fear the worst.

1084
02:02:08,205 --> 02:02:11,405
your family will be evicted if he dies.

1085
02:02:14,167 --> 02:02:16,247
I'm offering you my help sincerely.

1086
02:02:18,329 --> 02:02:19,569
Noone else seems to care.

1087
02:02:21,249 --> 02:02:23,810
Who is this husband of yours?

1088
02:02:24,932 --> 02:02:26,171
How can he abandon you like this?

1089
02:02:27,293 --> 02:02:29,173
Tess!

1090
02:04:52,309 --> 02:04:55,869
There's a point beyond
which obstinity becomes stupedity.

1091
02:04:59,471 --> 02:05:01,431
Are you in love with this drudgery?

1092
02:05:04,473 --> 02:05:06,113
I may be a sham-D'Urberville

1093
02:05:06,433 --> 02:05:08,274
but my little finger can
do more for you than

1094
02:05:08,554 --> 02:05:09,835
your blue-blooded ancestors.

1095
02:05:13,917 --> 02:05:17,437
I'm right. You know I am.

1096
02:05:23,120 --> 02:05:24,881
Forget about all this

1097
02:05:26,281 --> 02:05:27,121
and forget about that mule

1098
02:05:27,562 --> 02:05:28,802
that you call your husband.

1099
02:05:33,164 --> 02:05:36,765
Go on. Hit me. I shall not cry out.

1100
02:05:38,446 --> 02:05:40,367
Once beckon...
always beckon again.

1101
02:05:41,206 --> 02:05:42,006
That's law.

1102
02:05:42,769 --> 02:05:43,768
I was your master once

1103
02:05:46,489 --> 02:05:47,209
and so shall be again.

1104
02:05:49,650 --> 02:05:53,011
If you are any man's wife,
you are mine.

1105
02:05:55,092 --> 02:05:56,293
My own dear husband.

1106
02:05:57,654 --> 02:06:00,255
I shall die soon unless
I get a word from you.

1107
02:06:01,656 --> 02:06:03,856
All my letter have
remained unanswered.

1108
02:06:05,736 --> 02:06:08,057
Have you even received them?

1109
02:06:10,018 --> 02:06:14,179
I long for one thing only.
And that is to see you again.

1110
02:06:15,460 --> 02:06:16,580
Come back to me Angel.

1111
02:06:17,902 --> 02:06:21,062
Come back to me and save me
from the thing that threatens me.

1112
02:06:55,516 --> 02:06:59,436
Any reasonable person would
call this a ludicrous situation.

1113
02:07:01,038 --> 02:07:04,558
I offered to help you.
You wanned all of that.

1114
02:07:05,920 --> 02:07:09,360
You prefer to turnyourself into gypsies.

1115
02:07:10,121 --> 02:07:10,602
Please go.

1116
02:07:11,402 --> 02:07:14,402
In other words, Mrs. Clare,
you are asking me to let

1117
02:07:14,643 --> 02:07:15,604
you starve in peace.

1118
02:07:15,843 --> 02:07:16,843
Go away!

1119
02:07:18,525 --> 02:07:20,245
You'll be civil yet.

1120
02:07:28,049 --> 02:07:30,289
What's to become of me
and my poor little mites?

1121
02:07:31,571 --> 02:07:33,450
WE be the D'Urberville family.

1122
02:07:33,691 --> 02:07:34,771
It's written there isn't it?

1123
02:07:35,211 --> 02:07:37,812
Oh yeah... it's written there
fine enough. I grant you.

1124
02:07:38,292 --> 02:07:39,493
But the rooms have been taken.

1125
02:07:40,373 --> 02:07:41,653
You never sent in your deposits.

1126
02:07:42,974 --> 02:07:45,374
He means the money to
pay for the account, mother.

1127
02:07:46,175 --> 02:07:48,055
There's more to life than money sir!

1128
02:07:48,977 --> 02:07:51,897
You can not leave these poor,
fatherless children in the streets.

1129
02:07:52,338 --> 02:07:53,179
It would be a crime!

1130
02:07:53,418 --> 02:07:53,859
Missus...

1131
02:07:54,059 --> 02:07:56,339
Hospitality is sacred,
even among the Pagan Turks!

1132
02:07:56,700 --> 02:07:58,340
Please Missus... tis your own fault.

1133
02:07:58,701 --> 02:07:59,701
We'll see about that.

1134
02:08:00,301 --> 02:08:02,781
We are a true descendents
of the knightly D'Urbervilles.

1135
02:08:03,182 --> 02:08:05,462
Nobody leaves us in
the streets like raw apples.

1136
02:08:05,703 --> 02:08:08,903
Not in the home of our ancestors.
Our boards are in the

1137
02:08:09,104 --> 02:08:10,865
crip there laid out there in their carpets.

1138
02:08:11,064 --> 02:08:11,744
what's with you...

1139
02:08:12,146 --> 02:08:15,266
No, my dear. What's true is true.
Your poor father's eyes

1140
02:08:15,547 --> 02:08:17,107
are on us. We mustn't shame him.

1141
02:08:18,468 --> 02:08:21,789
Oh lord protect his own.
On the weekly champ he punished.

1142
02:08:22,470 --> 02:08:23,749
Ladies stopping here then?

1143
02:08:24,270 --> 02:08:25,870
no my good man. we are going on.

1144
02:08:26,632 --> 02:08:27,751
Good man... good man...

1145
02:08:28,232 --> 02:08:30,432
I ought to get by to Marlott.

1146
02:08:50,239 --> 02:08:51,080
Unload Darrell.

1147
02:08:51,520 --> 02:08:52,040
Where?

1148
02:08:52,321 --> 02:08:52,721
Here!

1149
02:08:53,041 --> 02:08:53,842
Here?

1150
02:08:54,082 --> 02:08:54,682
Yes Here.

1151
02:08:55,202 --> 02:08:56,922
We shall camp beside our church

1152
02:08:57,443 --> 02:08:58,764
until the town of our ancestors,

1153
02:08:59,003 --> 02:08:59,843
Find us our shelters.

1154
02:09:00,484 --> 02:09:02,444
Now come on children.
Set to work.

1155
02:10:44,804 --> 02:10:46,845
Why am I on the
wrong side of this door?

1156
02:11:59,073 --> 02:11:59,553
Yeah!

1157
02:11:59,993 --> 02:12:02,194
It's me Father, Angel!

1158
02:12:14,279 --> 02:12:16,959
My boy, my poor boy.

1159
02:12:17,280 --> 02:12:19,401
I've been ill but I'm alright now.

1160
02:12:36,648 --> 02:12:39,448
Why have you treated me
so monstrously Angel?

1161
02:12:40,489 --> 02:12:44,929
I do not deserve it.
I have thought it over carefully

1162
02:12:46,131 --> 02:12:48,411
and I can never, never forgive you.

1163
02:12:49,652 --> 02:12:53,653
You are cruel. I shall try to forget you.

1164
02:12:54,654 --> 02:12:58,735
All I ever received of
your hands is injustice.

1165
02:14:20,647 --> 02:14:22,088
Mr Durbeyfield.

1166
02:14:24,729 --> 02:14:26,290
Beg your pardon?

1167
02:14:26,930 --> 02:14:27,931
You are Mr Durbeyfield?

1168
02:14:29,491 --> 02:14:31,491
They don't live here no more.

1169
02:14:31,652 --> 02:14:32,693
Since when?

1170
02:14:33,812 --> 02:14:35,173
Since John Durbeyfield died.

1171
02:14:36,493 --> 02:14:37,813
Do you know where they went?

1172
02:14:51,419 --> 02:14:54,019
Durbeyfield... from 1832 to 1888

1173
02:14:54,901 --> 02:14:57,461
more properly D'Urberville of once

1174
02:14:57,782 --> 02:14:58,782
powerful family of that name

1175
02:14:59,823 --> 02:15:01,943
and directly descended
through illustrious lines

1176
02:15:02,184 --> 02:15:05,545
of Pagan D'Urberville.
Likes of a conqueror.

1177
02:15:06,025 --> 02:15:07,265
How are the mighty fallen?

1178
02:15:08,827 --> 02:15:10,546
Ah yes... how indeed.

1179
02:15:11,267 --> 02:15:13,227
May I? for the poor.

1180
02:15:15,349 --> 02:15:17,068
I prefer to settle
the Mason's account.

1181
02:15:18,230 --> 02:15:20,270
You'd think he's never
been paid for his work.

1182
02:15:22,752 --> 02:15:23,912
They were an odd family.

1183
02:15:24,512 --> 02:15:25,992
My collegue Mr Tringham,
would have done

1184
02:15:26,273 --> 02:15:27,512
better to have kept his mouth shut.

1185
02:16:02,727 --> 02:16:04,928
I should like to see Mrs Clare.

1186
02:16:08,090 --> 02:16:08,850
Tess

1187
02:16:10,170 --> 02:16:12,170
Yes I know. She's not here.

1188
02:16:13,811 --> 02:16:15,092
You are Mrs. Durbeyfield.

1189
02:16:16,371 --> 02:16:17,132
Yes

1190
02:16:18,253 --> 02:16:19,133
Where is she living?

1191
02:16:20,293 --> 02:16:21,014
I don't know.

1192
02:16:22,775 --> 02:16:23,695
I'm her husband.

1193
02:16:24,776 --> 02:16:26,095
I guessed as much.

1194
02:16:27,737 --> 02:16:28,857
Then tell me where she is.

1195
02:16:29,857 --> 02:16:30,817
Please, tell me.

1196
02:16:31,178 --> 02:16:34,338
Leave her. Leave her in peace.

1197
02:16:35,179 --> 02:16:37,340
My poor girl's suffered enough.

1198
02:16:38,701 --> 02:16:41,782
She don't care to see you sir. Never.

1199
02:16:57,388 --> 02:16:59,109
Mrs Durbeyfield,

1200
02:16:59,749 --> 02:17:01,909
take pity on a lonely,
wretched man.

1201
02:17:02,070 --> 02:17:03,510
Tell me where to find her.

1202
02:17:05,150 --> 02:17:05,911
I beg you.

1203
02:17:07,952 --> 02:17:08,873
She's at Sandbourne.

1204
02:17:09,072 --> 02:17:11,353
Sandbourne? But where?

1205
02:17:11,714 --> 02:17:13,194
It's a large town these days.

1206
02:17:13,514 --> 02:17:16,155
That's all I know. Sandbourne.

1207
02:17:44,566 --> 02:17:45,406
Excuse me.

1208
02:17:46,567 --> 02:17:48,127
I'm looking for a Mrs. Clare.

1209
02:17:48,728 --> 02:17:50,689
Would you by any
chance know her address?

1210
02:17:53,370 --> 02:17:56,811
Ah, George. You got a Clare around?

1211
02:17:59,412 --> 02:18:01,773
No... we've had a lot of
visitors here. You know.

1212
02:18:02,013 --> 02:18:03,414
Or Durbeyfield. Miss Durbeyfield.

1213
02:18:03,774 --> 02:18:05,054
D'Urberville at the Herons.

1214
02:18:05,294 --> 02:18:05,934
That's it. D'Urberville.

1215
02:18:06,334 --> 02:18:08,494
It's a boarding house sir. Can't miss it.

1216
02:18:08,696 --> 02:18:09,295
Where abouts?

1217
02:19:04,157 --> 02:19:04,677
Yes?

1218
02:19:05,317 --> 02:19:06,957
Please excuse me
for calling at this hour.

1219
02:19:07,838 --> 02:19:10,559
But do you have a Teresa
D'Urberville staying in your board?

1220
02:19:11,039 --> 02:19:12,160
Mrs D'Urberville you mean?

1221
02:19:12,841 --> 02:19:13,521
Yes.

1222
02:19:14,681 --> 02:19:15,401
Please come in.

1223
02:19:21,043 --> 02:19:22,604
Would be kind enough to
tell her that her relative

1224
02:19:22,804 --> 02:19:23,644
is anxious to see her?

1225
02:19:23,965 --> 02:19:25,765
It's rather early sir. What name shall I give?

1226
02:19:26,085 --> 02:19:26,845
Angel.

1227
02:19:27,326 --> 02:19:28,006
Mr Angel?

1228
02:19:28,327 --> 02:19:31,047
Angel. It's my christian name.
She'll understand.

1229
02:19:37,730 --> 02:19:40,131
I'll go and see if she's awake.

1230
02:20:40,674 --> 02:20:44,275
Tess. I came to ask your forgiveness.

1231
02:20:48,637 --> 02:20:49,597
It's too late.

1232
02:20:51,238 --> 02:20:54,238
Too late? My darling wife.

1233
02:20:55,640 --> 02:20:56,880
I've come to fetch you.
I'm going to...

1234
02:20:57,561 --> 02:21:00,122
Don't come near me Angel please.

1235
02:21:02,923 --> 02:21:05,764
Too Late. Too Late.

1236
02:21:07,245 --> 02:21:11,526
I'm not the man I was. I've suffered too.

1237
02:21:13,767 --> 02:21:15,407
I humbly beg you to forgive me.

1238
02:21:18,009 --> 02:21:24,411
Yes. yes... But I tell you it's too late.

1239
02:21:28,853 --> 02:21:31,213
Don't you know at all? Don't you?

1240
02:21:34,095 --> 02:21:35,975
How did you find your way here?

1241
02:21:38,497 --> 02:21:39,337
I saw your mother.

1242
02:21:44,019 --> 02:21:45,539
I waited and waited for you.

1243
02:21:46,499 --> 02:21:47,379
But you didn't come.

1244
02:21:49,301 --> 02:21:51,141
I wrote to you. But you didn't come.

1245
02:21:55,423 --> 02:21:58,263
He has been good tome.
To all of us.

1246
02:22:02,786 --> 02:22:06,467
He's won me back to him.
He's upstairs.

1247
02:22:10,988 --> 02:22:13,709
Go now Angel. Go please.

1248
02:22:16,832 --> 02:22:18,792
Never come back anymore.

1249
02:23:44,945 --> 02:23:45,905
Good morning my dear

1250
02:24:00,672 --> 02:24:01,711
WEll, what's the matter now?

1251
02:24:06,553 --> 02:24:07,513
You feeling unwell?

1252
02:24:09,435 --> 02:24:10,595
Is that why you have the vapours?

1253
02:24:12,996 --> 02:24:16,917
Yes? No?

1254
02:24:20,239 --> 02:24:24,199
yes I know. You are moping as usual.

1255
02:24:28,402 --> 02:24:32,203
For god's sake, try and make an effort.

1256
02:24:39,566 --> 02:24:41,006
Did you have a bad dream?

1257
02:24:47,969 --> 02:24:49,491
Brazil perhaps?

1258
02:25:07,177 --> 02:25:10,018
These mooning hysterics
of yours are in poor taste.

1259
02:25:14,060 --> 02:25:15,941
Don't forget we are
lunching with the Bennets.

1260
02:25:16,941 --> 02:25:18,302
I'd like you to look presentable.

1261
02:25:21,342 --> 02:25:22,983
A genuine D'Urberville.

1262
02:27:28,951 --> 02:27:31,392
I came to tell you that I killed him.

1263
02:27:38,956 --> 02:27:40,076
I've done it.

1264
02:27:41,997 --> 02:27:42,998
I don't know how

1265
02:27:47,079 --> 02:27:48,040
I don't know.

1266
02:27:49,919 --> 02:27:52,160
I tried to rake him with my glove put

1267
02:27:53,761 --> 02:27:55,122
the blood in his mouth

1268
02:27:57,123 --> 02:27:58,803
I thought I might be capable of it

1269
02:28:01,484 --> 02:28:06,445
Yes... yes. It was from that day on

1270
02:28:07,567 --> 02:28:08,327
What's mean?

1271
02:28:10,007 --> 02:28:11,328
I've killed him

1272
02:28:21,412 --> 02:28:22,651
I won't desert you.

1273
02:28:23,613 --> 02:28:26,093
I shall protect you by
every means in my power.

1274
02:28:27,335 --> 02:28:29,375
Whatever you may or may
not have done, I love you.

1275
02:28:29,935 --> 02:28:31,495
I love you.

1276
02:28:33,177 --> 02:28:34,217
Will they hang me?

1277
02:28:44,300 --> 02:28:47,021
WE must get out at the next
station and head north on foot.

1278
02:28:48,462 --> 02:28:50,223
They'll be looking for us at the Wessex ports.

1279
02:28:51,784 --> 02:28:53,625
Once we reach the north
we'll go abroad.

1280
02:29:45,124 --> 02:29:46,405
WE have makings of a mule here.

1281
02:29:47,126 --> 02:29:48,006
and a bottle of wine.

1282
02:32:41,993 --> 02:32:43,193
Rest at last.

1283
02:36:36,202 --> 02:36:38,083
We must leave at once.

1284
02:36:42,526 --> 02:36:46,767
WE must leave here as soon as possible.

1285
02:36:48,328 --> 02:36:51,769
My life couldn't be a matter of weeks?

1286
02:36:53,450 --> 02:36:54,610
Why not wait for them here?

1287
02:36:56,010 --> 02:36:57,931
Since they'll catch me in any case.

1288
02:36:59,091 --> 02:37:00,172
I'm going to save you.

1289
02:37:00,692 --> 02:37:01,413
Do you hear?

1290
02:37:01,973 --> 02:37:03,173
I'm going to save you.

1291
02:38:22,844 --> 02:38:24,044
Can't we rest here?

1292
02:38:25,165 --> 02:38:29,166
I'm afraid not. By day this place
is visible from miles around.

1293
02:38:32,208 --> 02:38:34,049
There are no stars tonight.

1294
02:38:39,131 --> 02:38:41,971
Perhaps we could have made
our souls take flight together.

1295
02:38:51,535 --> 02:38:53,295
Do they sacrifice to god here?

1296
02:38:54,536 --> 02:38:58,377
No . To the sun I believe. It's a Pagan temple.

1297
02:39:01,899 --> 02:39:03,140
Older than the ages.

1298
02:39:06,101 --> 02:39:07,460
Older than the D'Urbervilles.

1299
02:39:16,464 --> 02:39:18,865
Do you think we shall meet again after death?

1300
02:39:26,868 --> 02:39:29,229
I'm afraid Angel. I'm afraid.

1301
02:40:38,977 --> 02:40:40,337
There's no use sir.

1302
02:40:41,297 --> 02:40:42,817
The whole country's roused.

1303
02:40:58,345 --> 02:41:02,465
She's sleeping. Just a little longer.

1304
02:41:21,272 --> 02:41:22,713
Have they come for me?

1305
02:41:23,994 --> 02:41:25,515
Yes.

1306
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:41,400
I'm ready.
