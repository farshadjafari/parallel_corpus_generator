00:03:03,147 --> 00:03:05,020
Open the register.

2
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:08,900
Shut up, open the fucking register!

3
00:03:11,872 --> 00:03:12,872
Shut up.

4
00:03:13,869 --> 00:03:15,979
Hey you. Come over here.

5
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,900
Your wallet. Throw it on the floor.

6
00:03:27,214 --> 00:03:30,266
- Come on!
- Come, come!

7
00:03:35,851 --> 00:03:37,988
Put it in a fucking bag! 

8
00:03:38,604 --> 00:03:42,048
- Paper or plastic?
- Plastic.

9
00:03:44,487 --> 00:03:46,659
Hey you, get over here.

10
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,415
Look, lady, I don't give a shit what you're doing here, okay

11
00:03:51,415 --> 00:03:54,332
Do what you have to do, just let me out of it.

12
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,054
What'd you say?

13
00:03:56,951 --> 00:03:58,604
You think I'm a lady?

14
00:03:59,402 --> 00:04:03,097
- Aren't you?
- Do you not think that'll shoot you in the face?

15
00:04:03,298 --> 00:04:04,812
I hope not.

16
00:04:08,121 --> 00:04:09,846
Drop that stuff.

17
00:04:09,847 --> 00:04:12,566
- What?
- That shit in your hand - drop it.

18
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:15,184
It is the last bottle, I need this.

19
00:04:15,185 --> 00:04:17,079
Drop it.

20
00:04:18,396 --> 00:04:21,648
- I've got a bleeding foot.
- I've got a fucking gun.

21
00:04:25,095 --> 00:04:26,692
Wow - Who's gonna pay for that?

22
00:04:31,989 --> 00:04:33,497
Give me my wallet.

00:04:45,154 --> 00:04:46,846

Drop the gun!

00:05:01,058 --> 00:05:02,999
- Drop it right now!
- Okay.

You want to fuck with me!

- What car?

00:05:18,561 --> 00:05:20,420

42
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,311
Hello?

43
00:06:56,312 --> 00:06:59,004
Hi, so sorry to disturb you.

44
00:06:59,005 --> 00:07:01,119
I am new to LA..

45
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:04,649
..and I was on my way to see a body of mine 
whom I'll be staying with..

46
00:07:04,649 --> 00:07:11,583
..and I was just mugged. They took my
phone, wallet, and I was actually injured in the process.

47
00:07:11,984 --> 00:07:17,223
I saw your sign of Jehova in your window 
and I was just wondering if I could come in..

48
00:07:17,224 --> 00:07:23,211
..and use your phone and just kind of collect myself.
I know how this must look like.

49
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,568
You follow Jehova then?

50
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:30,786
Yes yes, and you can imagine how pleased I was
when I saw the insignia in your window.

51
00:07:30,787 --> 00:07:33,478
But you don't wear the cross?

52
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:38,307
No, unfortunately it was ripped from my neck
during the mugging.

53
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:41,357
Perhaps you'll receive another next Christmas.

54
00:07:43,632 --> 00:07:45,454
I don't understand, I am a Christian?

55
00:07:45,455 --> 00:07:49,295
You may well be, 
but you certainly don't follow Jehovah.

56
00:07:49,296 --> 00:07:53,263
We don't celebrate Christmas and we certainly 
don't acknowledge the cross. Wolf.

57
00:08:23,926 --> 00:08:26,096
<i> Dear Warwick, I'm in
Sidney and I love sunny ...</i>

58
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,118
<i> Love Julia. </i>

59
00:09:07,577 --> 00:09:08,711
Yes?

60
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,092
Erh yes, is this Warwick?

61
00:09:11,313 --> 00:09:13,165
Warwick, yes.
Who is it?

62
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:16,773
Hi Warwick, It's John,
I'm a friend of Julia.

63
00:09:16,774 --> 00:09:18,632
She's not here right now.

64
00:09:19,033 --> 00:09:21,958
Yeah, I know, I actually just left her in Sydney.

65
00:09:23,118 --> 00:09:24,436
Really?

66
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,022
What I can do for you?

67
00:09:29,353 --> 00:09:31,268
Well, I'm in a bit of a bide actually, erh..

68
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:35,992
I just arrived back in the country, 
and the airport lost my luggage

69
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:38,224
and on top of everything else I was mugged.

70
00:09:38,398 --> 00:09:39,937
Oh, my God.

71
00:09:40,378 --> 00:09:45,265
Yeah yeah and I planned on staying with
my cousin and now nobody is home.

72
00:09:46,054 --> 00:09:47,299
Yes...?

73
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,826
Look, would not normally do
something, but ...

74
00:09:51,668 --> 00:09:55,300
... Julia not stop talking
on the great person you are,

75
00:09:55,677 --> 00:09:59,372
was going to call anyway
I thought ...

76
00:10:04,518 --> 00:10:09,212
I thought maybe I could go
and fix the issues.

77
00:10:09,213 --> 00:10:11,303
You are my last resort.

78
00:10:12,809 --> 00:10:18,316
I ... I love to help but ...
I expect people to dinner.

79
00:10:19,164 --> 00:10:22,640
I'd be doing a
great favor.

80
00:10:23,472 --> 00:10:24,903
Sorry.

81
00:10:24,904 --> 00:10:28,300
Okay, no hard feelings.
Maybe another time.

82
00:10:41,592 --> 00:10:43,621
- John?
- Yes.

83
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:48,986
Sorry, I do not forgive Julia,
Sure you can spend.

84
00:10:48,987 --> 00:10:52,455
- You must be exhausted. I'm Warwick.
- John.

85
00:10:59,287 --> 00:11:02,559
Can I get you something to drink?
¿Mineral water, wine?

86
00:11:03,273 --> 00:11:05,283
Yes, wine.

87
00:11:06,294 --> 00:11:08,380
- Red or white?
- Red.

88
00:11:09,066 --> 00:11:10,181
Thank you.

89
00:11:42,006 --> 00:11:43,248
Here you go.

90
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,578
Thank you.

91
00:11:46,085 --> 00:11:48,273
- Linda home.
- Thanks.

92
00:11:49,048 --> 00:11:50,577
Please take a seat.

93
00:11:50,616 --> 00:11:51,978
Okay, thanks.

94
00:11:56,727 --> 00:11:59,994
- And how was Australia.
- Oh, great.

95
00:12:01,961 --> 00:12:06,642
Beautiful, the beaches are amazing,
I wish I could have stayed longer.

96
00:12:07,376 --> 00:12:10,238
Travel. One of the real
pleasures of life.

97
00:12:13,662 --> 00:12:17,110
And then what do you do when
not traveling?

98
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,689
I do this and that.

99
00:12:21,555 --> 00:12:23,806
I do not know what to call it.

100
00:12:25,569 --> 00:12:27,967
We all have so many options
these days, right?

101
00:12:32,504 --> 00:12:34,966
And then? How are you
Julia?

102
00:12:35,647 --> 00:12:38,803
Okay, very, very well.

103
00:12:38,804 --> 00:12:40,600
How do you feel about returning
to work?

104
00:12:41,101 --> 00:12:44,396
- Well, well.
- I'm surprised.

105
00:12:45,115 --> 00:12:47,312
The last time he spoke
on leave.

106
00:12:47,979 --> 00:12:51,008
You know, did not talk much
about it.

107
00:12:51,008 --> 00:12:55,039
Do not blame her, I could not
with that work. Could you?

108
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,290
No, I could not.

109
00:12:58,468 --> 00:13:01,517
Hey, I need to keep an eye
the dinner would you ...?

110
00:13:01,518 --> 00:13:02,668
Yeah, right.

111
00:13:10,258 --> 00:13:13,820
- Have you lived here a long time?
- A while.

112
00:13:25,197 --> 00:13:26,385
Do you live alone?

113
00:13:30,528 --> 00:13:31,723
Yes.

114
00:13:38,531 --> 00:13:40,367
In case you need to use the phone.

115
00:13:42,673 --> 00:13:44,602
You said you had to fix things.

116
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:47,664
Thank you.

117
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:03,959
Me.
I'll call you later.

118
00:14:05,777 --> 00:14:07,408
- No luck?
- No.

119
00:14:08,332 --> 00:14:11,730
- Carrots?
- No, I'm fine, thanks.

120
00:14:13,132 --> 00:14:16,695
I hate to ask, could you pass here
another half hour ...

121
00:14:16,696 --> 00:14:18,778
... Until my cousin again
home?

122
00:14:19,097 --> 00:14:21,988
I know I'm teasing,
but it is one of those days.

123
00:14:21,989 --> 00:14:26,861
Yeah, right. Sit back, relax,
solve this.

124
00:14:28,836 --> 00:14:32,370
Tell you what, call the airport
and see if I can locate your luggage.

125
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,681
I would not worry about it.

126
00:14:34,855 --> 00:14:38,430
I left my cousin's information
and said they would call.

127
00:14:39,256 --> 00:14:42,230
- But your cousin is not home, do you?
- Prima.

128
00:14:42,231 --> 00:14:43,394
Your cousin is not.

129
00:14:43,395 --> 00:14:47,287
If you press these people,
will be the last to receive anything.

130
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:51,603
- What airline was it?
- Quantus.

131
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:57,265
Hello. I communicate with luggage
Quantus lost at LAX, please.

132
00:15:01,056 --> 00:15:04,911
Yeah, hi. Looking for a luggage ...
Wait.

133
00:15:05,077 --> 00:15:10,805
- Do you have the receipt for the suitcase?
- No, I was in my wallet.

134
00:15:12,319 --> 00:15:14,753
No, it does not.
What is your name?

135
00:15:14,754 --> 00:15:16,042
Jones.

136
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,649
Did John Jones?

137
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,197
My parents ...

138
00:15:21,365 --> 00:15:23,645
- It's Jones.
- ... Not very creative.

139
00:15:24,578 --> 00:15:25,906
If, Sydney.

140
00:15:28,604 --> 00:15:29,741
Sure.

141
00:15:33,491 --> 00:15:37,223
I see.
They have no name Jones.

142
00:15:38,461 --> 00:15:39,675
How?

143
00:15:40,027 --> 00:15:42,120
- What?
- Your luggage, describe.

144
00:15:42,121 --> 00:15:43,298
Wait a minute.

145
00:15:43,299 --> 00:15:47,466
Black suitcase, medium, a ribbon
red on the handle.

146
00:15:47,665 --> 00:15:50,202
Well, if I describe the luggage ...

147
00:15:54,023 --> 00:15:55,834
When will it return?

148
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,398
- This person does not want to deal with me.
- Do not worry, hang up.

149
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,399
Do not worry.

150
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,106
He says the supervisor will return in
an hour, how your cousin is already at home?

151
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:09,239
I do not know, she did not expect
going to surprise her.

152
00:16:10,354 --> 00:16:12,062
This gets very complicated.

153
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:14,920
What if you stay for dinner?

154
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,545
You can call the supervisor
in an hour. What do you think?

155
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:22,020
I think it's a great idea. Thank you.

156
00:16:22,862 --> 00:16:26,380
Okay, I'll call you.
Thank you.

157
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,685
Well, it's fixed.

158
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,509
Now, I need to prepare,
feel at home

159
00:16:31,509 --> 00:16:36,092
no more wine in the kitchen
I'll go for a moment.

160
00:17:15,674 --> 00:17:18,374
- John?
- Yes.

161
00:17:18,575 --> 00:17:23,687
Tell me, I know what you and
Julia did in Sydney.

162
00:17:23,688 --> 00:17:25,219
Do not forget any details.

163
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,102
Just hang out.

164
00:17:28,502 --> 00:17:30,033
How did you meet?

165
00:17:30,643 --> 00:17:32,232
For a mutual friend.

166
00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:34,271
We met at a party
birthday.

167
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:41,636
- But they spent time together.
- If we did some traveling,

168
00:17:41,636 --> 00:17:45,269
I wished I could spend more time
with it is a great girl.

169
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:48,109
Yes. Does she suggested that I
visited?

170
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:51,966
- If you thought that we'd get along well.
- Is typical of Julia.

171
00:17:54,069 --> 00:17:57,260
- It's strange too.
- What?

172
00:17:57,473 --> 00:17:59,692
I talked to her 2 days ago
and do not mention it.

173
00:18:01,348 --> 00:18:04,354
Very strange, maybe I forgot.

174
00:18:04,555 --> 00:18:08,781
It is unlikely, she always
tells me everything. It's weird.

175
00:18:09,752 --> 00:18:11,381
Do not mention at all.

176
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,801
I hope you mention me
the next time they speak.

177
00:18:17,084 --> 00:18:19,987
You're right, we will
call.

178
00:18:20,554 --> 00:18:22,228
I'll get the phone.

179
00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:25,651
Julia sure you do not realize that
we are both here.

180
00:18:30,425 --> 00:18:36,655
I think it is 9 am
Sydney should be awake.

181
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:41,523
Guess what? I do
yoga on Wednesdays.

182
00:18:42,769 --> 00:18:44,485
I do not know if he's there.

183
00:18:45,787 --> 00:18:49,852
But not Wednesday.
It's Thursday morning there, right?

184
00:18:51,012 --> 00:18:54,120
You're right. Van later
us.

185
00:18:55,071 --> 00:18:56,221
It's Thursday.

186
00:19:00,655 --> 00:19:01,851
Is ringing.

187
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,351
Answering machine.

188
00:19:13,563 --> 00:19:16,240
Hi Jules, I am, I'm here
John.

189
00:19:16,241 --> 00:19:19,301
Who greets you. He had a trip
nightmare.

190
00:19:19,302 --> 00:19:23,798
I wish I had said was coming.
In preparation. Whatever.

191
00:19:24,182 --> 00:19:26,739
I hope you are well, call me
when you can. Goodbye.

192
00:19:27,858 --> 00:19:31,570
You should still be asleep.
I continue cooking.

193
00:19:31,983 --> 00:19:34,862
Get comfortable.
My guests will not be long.

194
00:19:34,863 --> 00:19:36,486
- Are you okay?
- Good.

195
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:41,589
- Where is your bathroom?
- Sure, here.

196
00:19:42,763 --> 00:19:44,815
Down the hall, second door
to the left.

197
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:45,966
Thank you.

198
00:19:47,957 --> 00:19:49,809
What? You're limping.

199
00:19:50,258 --> 00:19:53,447
I had a sprained ankle
is still healing.

200
00:19:53,447 --> 00:19:56,662
Oh, sprained ankle
This is not good, John.

201
00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:59,949
Were you drunk, John?

202
00:20:01,772 --> 00:20:03,490
Come on, admit it.

203
00:20:03,917 --> 00:20:07,155
I have been giving
red wine tonight.

204
00:20:08,693 --> 00:20:10,838
I am a man of white wine.

205
00:20:12,001 --> 00:20:16,305
The red is hard on my body.
Too rustic.

206
00:20:16,405 --> 00:20:17,933
In addition to stained teeth.

207
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,312
<i> Have you been to Romania? </i>

208
00:20:24,513 --> 00:20:27,331
They drink much wine <i> and all
have red teeth. </i>

209
00:20:30,733 --> 00:20:33,820
Or maybe eat much red meat,
I do not know but have red teeth

210
00:20:34,021 --> 00:20:35,510
Those are the Romanians.

211
00:20:44,408 --> 00:20:45,652
Magnificent.

212
00:21:06,067 --> 00:21:07,791
Who's Coming to Dinner?

213
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,917
Only old friends.

214
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:11,944
What do they do?

215
00:21:11,973 --> 00:21:17,015
One is an artist, journalist,
lawyer.

216
00:21:17,016 --> 00:21:18,266
Will you advocate?

217
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:21,265
Yes. Roman.
It's brilliant

218
00:21:21,366 --> 00:21:24,216
I say that should change
sides, start your own practice

219
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:27,627
make more money, but it will not.
Matter of principle.

220
00:21:31,112 --> 00:21:34,087
Is a tax attorney?

221
00:21:34,188 --> 00:21:38,683
God, no. He is a prosecutor. Work in
the District Attorney's Office.

222
00:21:38,883 --> 00:21:40,640
Very talented.

223
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:46,480
You planned a dinner
very nice.

224
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:51,152
I ... I'm exhausted.
I think I'll go.

225
00:21:51,494 --> 00:21:53,168
I am very tired.

226
00:21:53,793 --> 00:21:55,922
My cousin should be in
home now.

227
00:21:55,923 --> 00:21:59,410
No, do not be ridiculous.
I can not leave you helpless.

228
00:21:59,411 --> 00:22:01,718
Oh no, I will not ruin your dinner.

229
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:05,380
I'm tired and I'm not that interesting
and guests will have.

230
00:22:05,781 --> 00:22:09,859
No, sit, sit.
It will be an informal dinner.

231
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:13,229
A little wine, light conversation,
not have to do anything.

232
00:22:13,397 --> 00:22:15,578
My guests are very funny.

233
00:22:15,925 --> 00:22:18,533
Trust me.
You will be captivated.

234
00:22:18,534 --> 00:22:19,684
Seriously.

235
00:22:24,788 --> 00:22:27,367
And then what time
it all starts.

236
00:22:28,152 --> 00:22:31,782
It is assumed that at 8 but as
usual, will come later.

237
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:33,499
<i> ... several robberies including one
$ 300.000 ...</i>

238
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,421
It is so hard to be punctual.

239
00:22:35,422 --> 00:22:36,422
<i> ... an unidentified woman ...</i>

240
00:22:36,423 --> 00:22:38,871
A matter of hours,
make a list.

241
00:22:40,272 --> 00:22:41,404
It's not that hard.

242
00:22:41,405 --> 00:22:43,246
Can you keep quiet
in time?

243
00:22:43,647 --> 00:22:45,516
Is flat. It's simple.

244
00:22:45,889 --> 00:22:48,403
<i> - Management planning.
- ... A robbery at an art gallery ...</i>

245
00:22:48,404 --> 00:22:50,024
Shut the fuck up!

246
00:22:51,446 --> 00:22:52,838
Excuse me?

247
00:22:53,869 --> 00:22:58,096
You can be friends with Julia
but do not allow that language ...

248
00:22:58,097 --> 00:22:59,506
... I think it will be better
you go.

249
00:22:59,913 --> 00:23:01,366
There's your fucking Julia.

250
00:23:01,367 --> 00:23:05,434
<i> ... a man probably responsible
of a bank robbery this afternoon </i>

251
00:23:05,435 --> 00:23:09,854
<i> an employee identified as the
Los Angeles resident John Taylor, </i>

252

257
00:23:29,281 --> 00:23:31,846

258
00:23:36,805 --> 00:23:37,914
Sit.

259
00:23:40,135 --> 00:23:41,364
Sit!

260
00:24:14,724 --> 00:24:16,239
I do not care if you smoke.

261
00:24:23,804 --> 00:24:25,158
Do you mind if I smoke?

262
00:24:36,907 --> 00:24:38,356
Do not kill me, I'll have dinner.

263
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:48,446
I'll cut your throat, you'll
in the bath, I'll eat your food,

264
00:24:49,002 --> 00:24:50,709
and sleep in your bed.

265
00:24:52,263 --> 00:24:53,469
Do you understand?

266
00:24:56,099 --> 00:25:01,201
I want you to take the phone call
your friends and tell them to fuck.

267
00:25:03,962 --> 00:25:05,177
Agreed.

268
00:25:18,006 --> 00:25:21,745
Rupert, I,
if you know you're delayed

269
00:25:21,746 --> 00:25:23,907
no matter, I must cancel.

270
00:25:25,587 --> 00:25:27,778
I have ... a terrible migraine.

271
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,433
Yeah, you could call
others and apologize for me?

272
00:25:34,424 --> 00:25:39,456
No, no. All is well,
I'll see you tomorrow.

273
00:25:48,326 --> 00:25:49,550
Good boy.

274
00:26:21,692 --> 00:26:22,915
Oh, my God.

275
00:26:23,846 --> 00:26:26,120
You ...
... You're bleeding.

276
00:26:29,025 --> 00:26:33,890
I can deal with it ..
please let me ... some water ...

277
00:26:43,898 --> 00:26:45,028
Better.

278
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:48,840
What the hell are you doing?

279
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,170
Cleaning your dirty mess.

280
00:26:55,175 --> 00:26:57,196
I'm not playing
Understand?

281
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:02,590
Do you understand?

282
00:27:19,169 --> 00:27:21,180
- News?
- Oh yes.

283
00:27:22,772 --> 00:27:25,246
You must be devastated.

284
00:27:27,257 --> 00:27:28,799
Yes, but get over it.

285
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,533
- Hey was brutal.
- There will be 5 games the next season.

286
00:27:33,789 --> 00:27:35,795
I hope you did not bet money.

287
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:38,832
That would be illegal.

288
00:27:40,062 --> 00:27:41,222
Right.

289
00:27:41,738 --> 00:27:43,734
- What is that?
- Statements by witnesses.

290
00:27:44,972 --> 00:27:46,377
Do we track a witness?

291
00:27:46,412 --> 00:27:49,455
If the cashier. It's who identified
Taylor.

292
00:27:49,556 --> 00:27:52,339
Taylor says he was in several
occasions.

293
00:27:52,495 --> 00:27:53,687
Really?

294
00:27:53,688 --> 00:27:58,177
Taylor has no account, one would
because he liked it.

295
00:27:58,791 --> 00:28:01,685
Asked her out at least
3 times

296
00:28:01,872 --> 00:28:05,439
she received a number
and never called, John stopped going.

297
00:28:05,709 --> 00:28:07,232
Until today.

298
00:28:08,343 --> 00:28:10,222
Is your home phone.

299
00:28:10,323 --> 00:28:13,520
I think that
or is an idiot, o. ..

300
00:28:14,372 --> 00:28:17,964
the game was romantic
alibi to study the bank.

301
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:20,707
Well, he's an idiot anyway

302
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:24,085
not give someone your phone
and then steal.

303
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,750
Wore a wig
and sunglasses.

304
00:28:31,163 --> 00:28:32,337
That was ingenious.

305
00:28:47,668 --> 00:28:48,904
Why did you do?

306
00:28:51,722 --> 00:28:52,961
Do what?

307
00:28:53,112 --> 00:28:54,312
Stealing.

308
00:28:56,421 --> 00:28:58,173
Why not win honestly?

309
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,589
I do not care, alone,
I have curiosity.

310
00:29:03,694 --> 00:29:05,641
All the money is spent.

311
00:29:06,505 --> 00:29:07,647
Yes?

312
00:29:11,618 --> 00:29:13,023
Do you know what the hell?

313
00:29:13,224 --> 00:29:14,424
I'm just saying.

314
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:19,209
Stealing is not the answer.

315
00:29:34,041 --> 00:29:35,757
Okay, so things will be.

316
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:40,547
I'll kill you

317
00:29:41,578 --> 00:29:43,287
It will be a difficult decision.

318
00:29:46,489 --> 00:29:50,852
But if you're ready,
may change his mind.

319
00:29:52,774 --> 00:29:55,912
To begin with, you will keep your
ignorant opinions to yourself.

320
00:29:56,411 --> 00:29:58,065
Because I do not know.

321
00:30:00,125 --> 00:30:04,848
If you follow my instructions,
and you get out of my way to morning

322
00:30:05,148 --> 00:30:06,654
will not get hurt.

323
00:30:10,935 --> 00:30:13,667
Just help me
overnight.

324
00:30:14,561 --> 00:30:15,733
Right?

325
00:30:25,275 --> 00:30:26,515
Do you understand?

326
00:31:12,826 --> 00:31:14,818
I told them I was going to prepare duck.

327
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:16,638
They knew it was a special night.

328
00:31:16,986 --> 00:31:18,457
Be here.

329
00:31:19,968 --> 00:31:23,785
They are so unreliable.
I always arrive early.

330
00:31:23,786 --> 00:31:25,045
I'm always on time.

331
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:30,174
I received many calls,
tasks, we left late.

332
00:31:30,174 --> 00:31:34,268
I'm so sorry, Warwick,
we are tired, we can not go.

333
00:31:42,652 --> 00:31:44,869
It is a scoundrel,
Right?

334
00:31:59,844 --> 00:32:05,181
Yes, Rupert and I have seen 2 times
I can not wait for the DVD.

335
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:11,665
Why do not you see?
Seriously, you should go.

336
00:32:16,077 --> 00:32:18,048
Well, Rupert, as well imitate.

337
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,313
John.

338
00:32:25,468 --> 00:32:27,976
- Sorry.
- I have not seen ...

339
00:32:34,845 --> 00:32:38,725
Monica, are you okay?
Sorry Rupert.

340
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:44,484
Sorry about that.

341
00:32:56,503 --> 00:32:57,645
Hey everyone.

342
00:32:59,151 --> 00:33:02,487
This is our new friend, John.
Say hello to John.

343
00:33:02,488 --> 00:33:03,732
Hi John.

344
00:33:05,887 --> 00:33:07,519
Missed a moment.

345
00:33:08,233 --> 00:33:10,371
- Are you okay?
- We were worried about you.

346
00:33:10,938 --> 00:33:12,100
If we were.

347
00:33:14,524 --> 00:33:16,531
- Were what?
- Worried about you.

348
00:33:17,378 --> 00:33:19,358
Take your damn hands
phenomenon.

349
00:33:20,472 --> 00:33:21,717
Fuck you!

350
00:33:25,018 --> 00:33:26,164
Manners.

351
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:37,805
Were you hungry, Rupert.
I swallow, little piggy.

352
00:33:39,874 --> 00:33:41,105
Then Roman,

353
00:33:41,611 --> 00:33:43,293
Any good event recently?

354
00:33:43,294 --> 00:33:45,591
John is interested in the process
in the judicial process.

355
00:33:45,592 --> 00:33:47,309
You know I can
talk about that, Warwick.

356
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:48,941
It is unethical.

357
00:33:48,942 --> 00:33:52,282
Come on. Just us.
Among these 4 walls.

358
00:33:53,761 --> 00:33:55,461
It is so boring, Roman.

359
00:33:55,461 --> 00:33:58,295
After all we have
real criminal here at this table.

360
00:33:59,557 --> 00:34:02,196
So,
Are you new to Los Angeles, John?

361
00:34:08,886 --> 00:34:11,617
Yes, just arrived from Sydney, Australia.

362
00:34:12,626 --> 00:34:15,747
- Very good friend.
- Chelsea, please.

363
00:34:15,748 --> 00:34:16,873
Get a grip please.

364
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:22,419
Monica and I went to this exhibition
Caravaggio, did last week?

365
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:24,742
Ah, yes, how was it?

366
00:34:25,167 --> 00:34:26,453
Amazing.

367
00:34:26,654 --> 00:34:30,072
There are only a few pieces, but have 2
different illuminations

368
00:34:30,073 --> 00:34:31,450
of each painting.

369
00:34:32,825 --> 00:34:35,092
A colorless,
the other ...

370
00:34:35,624 --> 00:34:39,094
If illuminated paintings
detail, thrilling.

371
00:34:39,129 --> 00:34:40,759
I think I have no Caravaggio.

372
00:34:41,218 --> 00:34:42,452
Kidding.

373
00:34:42,525 --> 00:34:45,445
- When painted?
- About 1600.

374
00:34:45,926 --> 00:34:47,611
An interesting character indeed.

375
00:34:47,876 --> 00:34:50,129
It was a pervert and a murderer.

376
00:34:50,766 --> 00:34:54,003
- What was it?
- Well, yes, but other than that ...

377
00:34:54,003 --> 00:34:56,629
Embarrass most
the current criminal.

378
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,693
Sounds creepy.

379
00:34:59,324 --> 00:35:01,602
I think I have a book
somewhere. Wait.

380
00:35:01,603 --> 00:35:02,803
I'll see if I find it.

381
00:35:07,115 --> 00:35:08,307
I love that.

382
00:35:13,323 --> 00:35:14,570
Here it is.

383
00:35:26,012 --> 00:35:27,848
Oh, God. Chelsea.

384
00:35:29,734 --> 00:35:34,913
All right. All right.
Here we go.

385
00:35:36,192 --> 00:35:37,731
John. John!

386
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,464
Yes, I know, poor creature.

387
00:36:00,002 --> 00:36:01,785
Are you going to apologize to Chelsea?

388
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:04,649
Excuse me?

389
00:36:05,018 --> 00:36:07,326
The Demolitions and
crushed.

390
00:36:14,991 --> 00:36:16,135
Well?

391
00:36:22,229 --> 00:36:25,311
Sorry. Did not see you.

392
00:36:33,311 --> 00:36:35,790
So John, what
of new and interesting?

393
00:36:38,606 --> 00:36:42,344
What is new is that I'm sitting
a bloody lunatic.

394
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,963
There's nothing interesting about it.

395
00:37:01,196 --> 00:37:03,257
I've had worse days
that, Warwick.

396
00:37:29,059 --> 00:37:31,369
Look at this.
I like it.

397
00:37:54,735 --> 00:37:56,330
From midnight.

398
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:17,452
You know, Roman, I'm beginning
to get your taste.

399
00:38:23,561 --> 00:38:24,952
And the end.

400
00:38:37,874 --> 00:38:43,581
John nervously
a place for you on each page.

401
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,485
Do we record this?

402
00:39:08,928 --> 00:39:11,430
- You mean a. ..
- Strips of the month.

403
00:39:11,531 --> 00:39:13,490
Whatever you
is down.

404
00:39:13,491 --> 00:39:17,500
All right. Call quarter
evidence, tell them to come down.

405
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:23,803
CRIMINAL MIND <i> </i>

406
00:39:35,708 --> 00:39:41,716
You're the most beautiful creature in which
has settled my eyes, exquisite.

407
00:39:41,717 --> 00:39:43,954
Sure you tell them that
all the girls.

408
00:39:43,955 --> 00:39:45,672
You're a womanizer.

409
00:39:45,673 --> 00:39:48,609
You are different, you are special.

410
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:50,849
How I can believe you?

411
00:39:53,644 --> 00:39:58,297
It's true. Many women have
traveled the road to Warwick,

412
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,446
interesting ways.

413
00:40:01,647 --> 00:40:04,552
We can not blame them,
for the love that I share.

414
00:40:04,553 --> 00:40:08,113
I know, but what about Julia?

415
00:40:08,542 --> 00:40:12,256
- She is in Australia.
- But you're with her, she is ...

416
00:40:12,557 --> 00:40:13,657
is ...

417
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:19,572
She is the boat of the night
loving daughter of the universe,

418
00:40:21,436 --> 00:40:23,938
My heart stops
flicker before you.

419
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:30,183
Do not brake
come to Warwick.

420
00:40:32,653 --> 00:40:33,631
Warwick.

421
00:40:33,632 --> 00:40:37,466
I'm very boring, Warwick,
there are other people here.

422
00:40:37,967 --> 00:40:40,053
Oh, I forgot.

423
00:40:40,757 --> 00:40:43,141
Are not all fun?

424
00:40:44,736 --> 00:40:48,247
I can not speak for all but
I'm having great.

425
00:40:48,548 --> 00:40:52,218
Warwick, did not have the
last party at Super 8?

426
00:40:52,687 --> 00:40:56,212
You're right, we do.
I will show.

427
00:40:56,413 --> 00:40:58,686
Roman, come, help me
John.

428
00:41:00,512 --> 00:41:04,056
Ready?
1, 2, 3.

429
00:41:13,668 --> 00:41:16,072
I wish you had been, you missed
a tremendous party.

430
00:41:34,269 --> 00:41:36,383
I myself did the hair
and makeup.

431
00:42:12,458 --> 00:42:15,959
It's so beautiful.
So beautiful.

432
00:42:52,113 --> 00:42:54,466
Pellízcame, Roman,
I have a party.

433
00:42:55,478 --> 00:42:56,668
Hello you.

434
00:42:57,223 --> 00:43:00,702
They're all here. Everyone is here
and here they all are.

435
00:43:01,052 --> 00:43:03,768
Rupert, keep these people busy
or I'll have you busy for you.

436
00:43:06,033 --> 00:43:07,463
Hello, Chelsea.

437
00:43:11,304 --> 00:43:12,676
Is not it great?

438
00:43:12,677 --> 00:43:15,671
I was worried that
no one would come but this is great.

439
00:43:15,672 --> 00:43:17,225
Are you having fun?

440
00:43:18,803 --> 00:43:21,920
Courage, John, is a party.

441
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:24,967
It does not look very happy.

442
00:43:25,168 --> 00:43:27,772
You only need to enter
the holiday spirit.

443
00:43:28,073 --> 00:43:30,296
Chelsea, Rupert, come here.

444
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:36,027
Ready,
1, 2, 3. Champagne!

445
00:44:02,407 --> 00:44:03,598
Hey, John.

446
00:44:05,793 --> 00:44:07,915
Oh, yes.
It's almost time, huh?

447
00:44:07,916 --> 00:44:09,705
Would you feel photogenic.

448
00:44:12,413 --> 00:44:14,202
Warwick, can I join I can
the conga line?

449
00:44:14,203 --> 00:44:15,353
What?

450
00:44:17,919 --> 00:44:20,044
What if I can join
the conga line.

451
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:25,959
I think we have a few minutes.

452
00:44:26,619 --> 00:44:29,716
But you have to drink
cocktail if you want to stay in shape.

453
00:44:31,614 --> 00:44:34,618
- What's in?
- Do you want it or not?

454
00:44:35,804 --> 00:44:39,093
Well, whatever you want, I must
prepare for the photo.

455
00:44:40,143 --> 00:44:41,508
I drink.

456
00:44:43,365 --> 00:44:46,555
Hey Rupert, make a cocktail for John.

457
00:45:14,564 --> 00:45:19,216
I think you're ready,
John. Conga!

458
00:45:31,392 --> 00:45:35,779
John, look what you've done.
Causes a heap.

459
00:46:48,666 --> 00:46:50,565
Hey you, not even
see you there.

460
00:46:50,566 --> 00:46:54,425
Why, if I'm good.
What? yes, I love you.

461
00:46:54,426 --> 00:46:57,965
Yes, I love you!
Say it again. Thank you.

462
00:46:57,966 --> 00:47:00,197
To you I've been waiting for.
Shake.

463
00:47:00,198 --> 00:47:02,734
Come on, shake.
Give it to me.

464
00:47:06,321 --> 00:47:10,042
How much did you drink?
Get away from me. You're a whore.

465
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:18,684
Hey, how have you been?

466
00:47:19,762 --> 00:47:24,116
Yes. No, it was better than
expected. It turned out well.

467
00:47:33,248 --> 00:47:35,400
No, it was great.
It's a great party.

468
00:47:40,633 --> 00:47:43,288
Oh, yeah, yeah.

469
00:47:43,571 --> 00:47:46,461
Everyone, everyone.

470
00:48:29,032 --> 00:48:32,050
- So you have fun?
- Yes I did.

471
00:48:35,085 --> 00:48:40,703
Sorry to Teri and Adam, they always
a bouquet of flowers when they come.

472
00:48:40,972 --> 00:48:42,128
All right.

473
00:48:46,172 --> 00:48:50,727
- Will I stay here tonight?
- I thought you would.

474
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:52,622
Yes?

475
00:48:53,043 --> 00:48:54,846
Have you got tired of me?

476
00:48:55,130 --> 00:49:01,051
- No. Not yet.
- Good.

477
00:49:03,093 --> 00:49:04,737
Oh, that reminds me ...

478
00:49:13,948 --> 00:49:16,926
Okay, okay.

479
00:49:30,805 --> 00:49:32,048
All right.

480
00:51:12,771 --> 00:51:13,983
Hello?

481
00:51:14,984 --> 00:51:16,096
Hello.

482
00:51:21,547 --> 00:51:22,712
Hello?

483
00:51:31,013 --> 00:51:32,188
Yes.

484
00:51:32,915 --> 00:51:37,123
Hello, sir. Wilson, sorry
I was not sure if he was here.

485
00:51:38,778 --> 00:51:43,338
His friend ... Are you
OK?

486
00:51:43,339 --> 00:51:46,428
Okay, okay.
It's a little drunk.

487
00:51:46,429 --> 00:51:48,545
He has been in his character
overnight.

488
00:51:49,074 --> 00:51:52,159
- What do you mean by character?
- We had a costume party.

489
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:53,791
Oh, God.

490
00:51:53,792 --> 00:51:56,755
He plays his character
jumping into the pool.

491
00:51:58,274 --> 00:52:00,260
It has become boring.

492
00:52:00,461 --> 00:52:04,707
I was suffering,
by the sound they made.

493
00:52:06,088 --> 00:52:08,505
No, I've said no
mix wines.

494
00:52:09,662 --> 00:52:12,416
I'm so sorry
the bothering.

495
00:52:12,417 --> 00:52:15,520
But I think it's over
I promise that there will be more noise.

496
00:52:15,521 --> 00:52:19,652
- Well, if all is well.
- Yeah, thanks, I'm sorry.

497
00:52:20,577 --> 00:52:23,207
- You will have to excuse me.
- Yeah, I quit.

498
00:52:23,208 --> 00:52:24,343
Take care of yourself.

499
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:53,586
- Okay, is that you drank too much.
- Excuse me, anything else?

500
00:52:53,714 --> 00:52:56,419
Are you sure he's
OK?

501
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:59,602
It seems to take off the mask.

502
00:52:59,803 --> 00:53:03,044
Thank God! I have tried
do it all night.

503
00:53:03,445 --> 00:53:07,959
It is very drunk, I think it's time
you go to bed, and me too.

504
00:53:08,036 --> 00:53:10,357
If nothing more ...

505
00:53:12,347 --> 00:53:13,993
- I guess not.
- Okay.

506
00:53:14,194 --> 00:53:16,593
- Good night.
- Good night.

507
00:53:17,686 --> 00:53:18,804
Good night.

508
00:53:21,182 --> 00:53:22,455
Good night.

509
00:53:23,844 --> 00:53:26,082
Come to bed, John.

510
00:53:46,029 --> 00:53:51,040
What if I go and call the police?
What will you do?

511
00:53:51,041 --> 00:53:52,949
Warwick probably
will collapse

512
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:55,332
is not the best
mastermind of the world.

513
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:56,483
Shut up!

514
00:53:57,966 --> 00:54:02,257
-What you should be thinking ...
- But what if the police come ...

515
00:54:04,693 --> 00:54:05,806
Shut up!

516
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:11,869
As you should be worried
Warwick, is your foot.

517
00:54:13,847 --> 00:54:15,583
I think that needs attention.

518
00:54:21,612 --> 00:54:23,765
Attention. Yes.

519
00:54:24,566 --> 00:54:29,084
I'll get your foot bleeding
stop leak in my apartment

520
00:54:29,085 --> 00:54:30,808
once and for all.

521
00:54:48,901 --> 00:54:50,039
Not covered.

522
00:54:50,506 --> 00:54:51,977
I told you already.

523
00:54:52,666 --> 00:54:56,816
- It is an elective procedure?
- Love, I'll be fine.

524
00:54:58,587 --> 00:55:01,706
Not good. It's a damn
joke.

525
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:03,659
Can you go to work tomorrow?

526
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:05,087
Yes, I'll be fine.

527
00:55:05,688 --> 00:55:07,880
You can not keep taking it.

528
00:55:08,227 --> 00:55:11,327
They damage your body pain
your liver collapse.

529
00:55:11,328 --> 00:55:12,793
Okay, doctor.

530
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,003
This is horrible.

531
00:55:23,693 --> 00:55:25,262
I get money.

532
00:55:26,092 --> 00:55:27,195
No.

533
00:55:29,297 --> 00:55:32,329
Hey, come here.
Please, love, come here.

534
00:55:39,386 --> 00:55:41,113
You will not rob anyone.

535
00:55:41,807 --> 00:55:43,478
It just will not happen.

536
00:55:44,453 --> 00:55:45,860
I've done before.

537
00:55:46,135 --> 00:55:48,292
If you went to prison and why.

538
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:51,387
I will not enter.

539
00:55:54,932 --> 00:55:56,791
Everything will be fine.

540
00:56:10,754 --> 00:56:12,704
Both are very good.

541
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:16,896
I can not decide.
Which do you prefer?

542
00:56:24,219 --> 00:56:25,728
I'll decide later.

543
00:56:27,395 --> 00:56:28,849
What will you do me?

544
00:56:34,268 --> 00:56:36,179
Good move, Roman.

545
00:56:36,954 --> 00:56:41,075
- Warwick. Warwick please listen to me.
- I hear you.

546
00:56:43,273 --> 00:56:45,141
Please do not do this, Warwick.

547
00:56:46,654 --> 00:56:47,787
Right?

548
00:56:49,525 --> 00:56:51,252
Please let me go.

549
00:56:51,953 --> 00:56:53,849
Warwick, I'll do anything.

550
00:56:55,801 --> 00:56:57,904
- Warwick.
- I would not do that, Roman.

551
00:57:00,873 --> 00:57:04,764
Every action has a reaction
equal and opposite, John.

552
00:57:05,664 --> 00:57:06,904
What?

553
00:57:07,205 --> 00:57:08,788
That's physics.

554
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:11,142
It is the law of nature.

555
00:57:14,716 --> 00:57:17,765
Oh, sweet.
Do not cry.

556
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:21,986
What I can do
to make you feel better?

557
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:24,218
Please let me go.

558
00:57:24,919 --> 00:57:26,196
Please do not kill me.

559
00:57:29,172 --> 00:57:33,356
You are my guest,
and I'm glad you're here.

560
00:57:34,121 --> 00:57:36,832
But you can only blame
yourself.

561
00:58:38,393 --> 00:58:39,967
And then where is it?

562
00:58:41,965 --> 00:58:43,133
Who?

563
00:58:44,188 --> 00:58:45,304
Julia.

564
00:58:49,606 --> 00:58:51,114
It's in Bangkok.

565
00:58:51,215 --> 00:58:53,802
It is planning to go to Hanoi
not yet been decided.

566
00:58:56,299 --> 00:58:57,876
Who has not decided?

567
00:58:59,927 --> 00:59:01,049
Julia.

568
00:59:02,342 --> 00:59:03,564
Who is she?

569
00:59:05,493 --> 00:59:08,645
She's the girl you met at
Australia, silly.

570
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:12,984
I've never been to Australia, Warwick.

571
00:59:14,693 --> 00:59:16,796
You mean you lied?

572
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:21,143
Yes. I lied.

573
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:24,847
It speaks well
your character.

574
00:59:26,683 --> 00:59:28,480
And you're Julia, Warwick.

575
00:59:31,436 --> 00:59:32,721
What?

576
00:59:33,958 --> 00:59:35,554
You're Julia.

577
00:59:36,998 --> 00:59:40,030
Roman, Rupert, Monica.

578
00:59:41,194 --> 00:59:42,845
All are you, Warwick.

579
00:59:47,747 --> 00:59:51,499
The fascinating thing about John is that I have
others to attend,

580
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:53,400
I can not be a
inattentive host.

581
00:59:59,806 --> 01:00:01,827
Does anyone fancy a final cocktail?

582
01:00:03,911 --> 01:00:08,306
Monica ¿? Oh, I forgot,
Do you prefer a dessert wine, coffee?

583
01:00:08,878 --> 01:00:10,345
Go ahead.
Rupert ¿?

584
01:00:12,879 --> 01:00:14,575
Keep the bottle to Roman.

585
01:00:18,685 --> 01:00:19,947
Now what?

586
01:00:21,854 --> 01:00:25,309
Now it's time to silence
John, it means ...

587
01:00:25,950 --> 01:00:29,757
reflection, silence,
OK?

588
01:00:31,219 --> 01:00:35,039
It is very entertaining.
Even I am your guest, right?

589
01:00:35,274 --> 01:00:36,525
Of course you are.

590
01:00:37,850 --> 01:00:39,094
Well ...

591
01:00:42,525 --> 01:00:44,140
What do you think?

592
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:48,136
Wait ...

593
01:00:48,739 --> 01:00:52,826
If you win, I give you freedom.

594
01:00:53,227 --> 01:00:55,580
But what if I get lost?

595
01:00:55,781 --> 01:00:58,532
You have my life, is not that enough?

596
01:00:58,533 --> 01:01:01,711
- I can not give more than that, Warwick.
- Yes, indeed.

597
01:01:02,531 --> 01:01:04,128
But that's what I have.

598
01:01:04,913 --> 01:01:06,581
Have you ever played chess before?

599
01:01:06,582 --> 01:01:09,122
- Yes, once or twice.
- Very good.

600
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:14,028
To tell me which piece to move,
you tell me a letter y. ..

601
01:01:14,029 --> 01:01:15,448
... A corresponding number.

602
01:01:15,449 --> 01:01:18,207
For example if you want to move the bishop
say ...

603
01:01:18,408 --> 01:01:21,351
... Bishop to king-3.

604
01:01:22,828 --> 01:01:26,516
Now I move my tower
Horse-7.

605
01:01:26,617 --> 01:01:28,775
Okay, and what is the best
strategy?

606
01:01:29,076 --> 01:01:33,660
That's the detail, do not control the
opponent's pieces, only yours.

607
01:01:33,961 --> 01:01:36,799
But if you know your opponent, you know
weaknesses,

608
01:01:38,098 --> 01:01:41,761
if you play well, you can influence
the behavior of your opponent.

609
01:01:43,138 --> 01:01:47,920
I see. If you listen and
pretend to be fascinated ...

610
01:01:47,921 --> 01:01:50,960
that I teach chess
So will you love me?

611
01:01:52,064 --> 01:01:54,708
Yeah, nice try
do not need anything.

612
01:01:54,909 --> 01:01:57,214
No need to pretend interest.

613
01:01:58,643 --> 01:02:01,194
What can you do to me?

614
01:02:01,495 --> 01:02:02,958
What can you do?

615
01:02:03,459 --> 01:02:07,805
The satisfaction of winning should
be enough for a man like you.

616
01:02:09,731 --> 01:02:12,827
No.
"To the victor goes the spoils."

617
01:02:14,891 --> 01:02:20,104
- How would pamper me, John?
- I do not know. How would you like?

618
01:02:24,746 --> 01:02:26,182
Let me think.

619
01:02:26,627 --> 01:02:28,729
- King.
- Yes.

620
01:02:29,125 --> 01:02:31,553
The whole game revolves around
the king.

621
01:02:31,554 --> 01:02:33,619
It is the part with less power.

622
01:02:33,793 --> 01:02:38,003
Their movements are limited,
Only then, one at a time.

623
01:02:39,578 --> 01:02:42,695
Sometimes the pawn is the most
important.

624
01:02:42,983 --> 01:02:44,991
It is the most ordinary piece ...

625
01:02:44,992 --> 01:02:49,080
is simple in its movement,
but used properly ...

626
01:02:49,081 --> 01:02:51,008
can be fully
devastating.

627
01:02:51,751 --> 01:02:54,047
It may seem that you
front,

628
01:02:54,448 --> 01:02:58,909
but if you pay attention,
your opponent may surprise you ...

629
01:03:01,789 --> 01:03:03,035
... A movement.

630
01:03:03,447 --> 01:03:05,112
That's the beauty of this game.

631
01:03:07,194 --> 01:03:09,458
I know you can do
when you lose.

632
01:03:10,387 --> 01:03:12,408
- Yes.
- I turn to move, right?

633
01:03:12,409 --> 01:03:16,073
- Yes, but okay.
- Queen G-6.

634
01:03:16,628 --> 01:03:19,885
- Well, then, when you win ...
- Checkmate.

635
01:03:22,333 --> 01:03:23,528
What?

636
01:03:24,993 --> 01:03:26,383
Checkmate.

637
01:03:26,884 --> 01:03:28,122
How did that happen?

638
01:03:29,245 --> 01:03:31,023
How did you do that?

639
01:03:31,124 --> 01:03:34,435
- We Warwick, untie.
- But he had the perfect reward.

640
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:38,449
You said that I would unleash
if he won, Warwick, come on.

641
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:44,156
Have you played this before.
Trickster.

642
01:03:49,055 --> 01:03:51,139
You're a damned liar, Warwick.

643
01:04:07,473 --> 01:04:11,577
I may be many things, John,
but something I'm not is a liar.

644
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:13,880
Feel free to leave.

645
01:04:24,789 --> 01:04:27,889
You really are a
negligible small, eh, John?

646
01:04:28,429 --> 01:04:31,301
Showed no conviction, no struggle.

647
01:04:31,802 --> 01:04:35,764
I'd let them do what
wanted. That is just what I did.

648
01:04:35,765 --> 01:04:38,458
In fact, I think I enjoyed it.

649
01:04:39,597 --> 01:04:41,082
You are nothing.

650
01:04:42,666 --> 01:04:47,084
You're disposable, forgettable
a replacement part.

651
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:48,922
You are nothing.

652
01:04:49,608 --> 01:04:51,150
It is as if they existed.

653
01:04:56,164 --> 01:04:59,624
What are you doing? John,
What do you do?

654
01:05:00,795 --> 01:05:04,207
John, that down, John.
Stop please.

655
01:05:04,308 --> 01:05:06,001
Treated me like an animal.

656
01:05:07,344 --> 01:05:09,655
I get involved in your
sick world.

657
01:05:11,318 --> 01:05:13,363
You took my dignity.

658
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:17,174
How dare you tell me
I'm nothing?

659
01:05:17,926 --> 01:05:19,267
But it's true.

660
01:06:10,874 --> 01:06:12,486
Hey, John.

661
01:06:14,633 --> 01:06:16,403
Look at that piece of ass.

662
01:06:26,513 --> 01:06:27,676
Love me!

663
01:06:33,951 --> 01:06:35,308
Love me!

664
01:09:19,164 --> 01:09:23,186
Warwick, know you have to take
two of these.

665
01:09:23,423 --> 01:09:24,655
No, no

666
01:09:25,957 --> 01:09:28,357
- He knows what he does.
- Really?

667
01:09:28,855 --> 01:09:31,589
I know you like,
you never know when you go, Monica

668
01:09:31,590 --> 01:09:33,705
but he needs to work
at work.

669
01:10:26,924 --> 01:10:28,468
Morton, what do you want?

670
01:10:28,469 --> 01:10:30,848
- Lieutenant, woke him up?
- No, I'm awake,

671
01:10:30,849 --> 01:10:33,727
- Very early.
- Yes, I know, sorry.

672
01:10:34,124 --> 01:10:35,613
Will want to see this.

673
01:10:36,014 --> 01:10:37,305
Okay, it happens.

674
01:10:40,124 --> 01:10:41,974
Come in, sit down,
I'm coming.

675
01:10:43,875 --> 01:10:45,260
Now I'm sure.

676
01:10:45,461 --> 01:10:47,164
John Taylor had help.

677
01:10:51,724 --> 01:10:53,609
One of the cashiers was
involved.

678
01:10:53,610 --> 01:10:55,000
Really?

679
01:10:55,001 --> 01:10:57,545
- I can use your television?
- I have not.

680
01:10:58,276 --> 01:10:59,626
Ah, I forgot.

681
01:11:04,665 --> 01:11:05,811
Very good.

682
01:11:06,773 --> 01:11:08,691
This is 3 weeks before the robbery.

683
01:11:09,272 --> 01:11:12,427
Taylor comes in,
full of the deposit slips.

684
01:11:13,408 --> 01:11:15,909
He is studying the bank.
That's it.

685
01:11:16,110 --> 01:11:17,674
How do you know who is Taylor?

686
01:11:18,753 --> 01:11:20,759
For the tattoo.

687
01:11:22,848 --> 01:11:24,048
That's him.

688
01:11:24,650 --> 01:11:27,208
According to the cashier
Simone De Marchi,

689
01:11:28,317 --> 01:11:29,918
this woman

690
01:11:29,919 --> 01:11:33,650
according to Simone, John enters
and asks her out,

691
01:11:34,195 --> 01:11:38,446
but if you notice,
He is not even close.

692
01:11:39,509 --> 01:11:43,151
Here is the time of the robbery,
John waiting in line,

693
01:11:44,052 --> 01:11:49,459
the cashier tells you that happens,
but he will not, lets move on to the back.

694
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:53,929
- He hopes, why do it?
- Simone wants treats.

695
01:11:53,930 --> 01:11:55,080
Exactly.

696
01:11:55,828 --> 01:11:57,935
She rings the alarm

697
01:11:59,018 --> 01:12:00,808
package does not
tracing

698
01:12:03,603 --> 01:12:05,659
could have done
any of these things

699
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:07,531
or tell someone else.

700
01:12:08,085 --> 01:12:10,865
He had every opportunity,
but does nothing.

701
01:12:10,866 --> 01:12:14,972
And then this, a month ago
reservation for 2 weeks vacation.

702
01:12:14,973 --> 01:12:16,903
- Guess when they start.
- Today.

703
01:12:18,392 --> 01:12:20,925
He lied about what John was looking for ...

704
01:12:20,926 --> 01:12:24,225
because I needed a reason
to identify it and tell us.

705
01:12:25,393 --> 01:12:28,580
They are together.
Or were.

706
01:12:28,815 --> 01:12:31,131
She gets the money.
He got caught.

707
01:12:31,332 --> 01:12:33,108
Go girl.

708
01:12:33,460 --> 01:12:35,349
Taylor Got clues?

709
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:38,001
Well, if we follow Simone
to find Taylor.

710
01:12:39,241 --> 01:12:42,818
- You think you go to look?
- When he discovered what he did, yes.

711
01:12:43,119 --> 01:12:44,642
Are you under surveillance?

712
01:12:45,077 --> 01:12:47,843
If Valdez is running
outside your home.

713
01:12:58,637 --> 01:13:01,870
<i> An employee identified him as
resident of Los Angeles, </i>

714
01:13:01,871 --> 01:13:03,151
John Taylor <i> ...</i>

715
01:13:29,805 --> 01:13:33,853
I want to check a reservation,
I will meet my wife at 9

716
01:13:33,854 --> 01:13:35,923
want to make sure
everything is recorded.

717
01:13:18,024 --> 01:13:19,824
CAR RENTAL
AMERICAN

718
01:13:37,398 --> 01:13:40,111
- Name?
- Simone Pryer.

719
01:13:48,133 --> 01:13:52,555
If you are registered, a Ford Sedan
9 am.

720
01:13:53,529 --> 01:13:55,747
Thanks, have a good day.

721
01:14:02,044 --> 01:14:05,679
If you listen and
pretend to be fascinated ...

722
01:14:08,774 --> 01:14:11,007
No need
feign interest.

723
01:14:31,325 --> 01:14:34,277
Yes, I want to confirm a reservation,
for this morning.

724
01:14:35,506 --> 01:14:36,804
Sure, Los Angeles.

725
01:14:38,370 --> 01:14:39,985
First name Simone.

726
01:14:41,677 --> 01:14:42,859
Nothing.

727
01:14:43,915 --> 01:14:45,652
Agreed.
Thank you.

728
01:14:48,511 --> 01:14:50,525
De Simone Pryer.

729
01:14:53,176 --> 01:14:55,947
No?
Okay, thanks.

730
01:15:01,102 --> 01:15:06,034
Do you?
What place is?

731
01:15:08,894 --> 01:15:10,689
He receives at 9 am Right?

732
01:15:13,785 --> 01:15:15,028
¿8 o'clock?

733
01:15:15,956 --> 01:15:17,456
Everything will be fine.

734
01:15:37,875 --> 01:15:39,786
- What happened?
- Nothing, sir.

735
01:15:40,287 --> 01:15:42,043
A light came on
20 minutes ago.

736
01:15:42,444 --> 01:15:43,599
That's something.

737
01:15:48,078 --> 01:15:50,691
- It still surprises me.
- What?

738
01:15:51,334 --> 01:15:55,592
These people. They should know that there
way to get away with it.

739
01:15:56,036 --> 01:15:59,083
If there is a way, someone
will try. It's human nature.

740
01:15:59,084 --> 01:16:03,134
Not that. There is something working
wrong with your damn brain.

741
01:16:03,535 --> 01:16:07,031
Why can not understand the two?

742
01:16:07,132 --> 01:16:09,137
You'd be unemployed
if they did.

743
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:14,080
The forces of law are
more than just a job, detective.

744
01:16:15,650 --> 01:16:17,489
Well, here it comes.

745
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:30,818
Do you know the problem?
There is no deterrence.

746
01:16:31,019 --> 01:16:32,514
Look southeast Asia,

747
01:16:32,658 --> 01:16:35,878
spit in public in Singapore
and is grounds for arrest

748
01:16:35,959 --> 01:16:37,597
if you get caught with drugs
is the death penalty.

749
01:16:37,898 --> 01:16:39,862
It's a little extreme, no?

750
01:16:40,119 --> 01:16:41,830
Is it?

751
01:16:41,831 --> 01:16:44,128
Check the levels of crime
in Singapore

752
01:16:45,094 --> 01:16:47,935
People should understand that
the government is serious.

753
01:16:48,260 --> 01:16:51,064
America is a liberal site,
Why do I have?

754
01:16:52,598 --> 01:16:54,933
Hey, is turning.

755
01:17:15,684 --> 01:17:17,088
Come on!

756
01:17:24,376 --> 01:17:26,974
- Move your car!
- Shut up!

757
01:17:27,824 --> 01:17:29,030
Move!

758
01:17:43,364 --> 01:17:45,091
Now I could be anywhere.

759
01:17:45,092 --> 01:17:46,521
Should we continue?

760
01:17:47,806 --> 01:17:50,076
Your next. Look in the levels
lower.

761
01:17:50,677 --> 01:17:52,027
Agreed.

762
01:17:52,817 --> 01:17:54,513
Keep your radios
on.

763
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:11,080
Do I expect?

764
01:18:11,081 --> 01:18:14,030
Love was so worried
for you.

765
01:18:14,031 --> 01:18:16,506
- No.
- What happened to your face?

766
01:18:19,079 --> 01:18:20,967
Listen, I do not know how I
found,

767
01:18:20,968 --> 01:18:25,130
you were looking for,
I've gone mad

768
01:18:25,131 --> 01:18:27,413
I'm desperate
the police on you

769
01:18:27,448 --> 01:18:31,087
do not know what to do, I changed
car was going to pick you up, love,

770
01:18:31,088 --> 01:18:32,739
I'm so happy to see ...

771
01:18:33,545 --> 01:18:35,055
You seem to feel better.

772
01:18:36,756 --> 01:18:38,174
Do not have pain this morning?

773
01:18:38,816 --> 01:18:40,733
- No, I'm ...
- Just stop.

774
01:18:41,241 --> 01:18:42,384
Okay, Simon?

775
01:18:46,726 --> 01:18:47,980
Why do this?

776
01:18:50,685 --> 01:18:53,562
Because you ... do.

777
01:18:55,105 --> 01:18:56,175
Am I what?

778
01:18:56,176 --> 01:18:59,529
The bank, even
I had to convince.

779
01:19:00,364 --> 01:19:05,291
What did you think you are a
career criminal.

780
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:09,181
What did you think would happen?

781
01:19:16,153 --> 01:19:17,954
I wanted to trust you.

782
01:19:19,442 --> 01:19:25,946
Well, maybe we can still do so,
know the truth, are no different.

783
01:19:26,047 --> 01:19:29,354
... But what they do
is to give each team a half ...

784
01:19:33,767 --> 01:19:35,789
... Could actually
bet some money ...

785
01:19:35,990 --> 01:19:40,470
You need me. You can not cross
the border without me.

786
01:19:40,471 --> 01:19:44,899
... If you want to get into this with me,
I can get better points ...

787
01:19:57,431 --> 01:20:01,353
... You can join but the thing is
if you bet money that a team ...

788
01:20:28,126 --> 01:20:29,375
Hello?

789
01:20:31,164 --> 01:20:32,728
That's not enough to quit.

790
01:20:33,429 --> 01:20:34,829
Give me the keys.

791
01:20:43,608 --> 01:20:45,243
Here Warwick, what happens?

792
01:20:45,527 --> 01:20:49,549
Lieutenant, we have Simone, we
in the car, no money.

793
01:20:49,650 --> 01:20:51,121
No sign of Taylor.

794
01:20:51,422 --> 01:20:54,034
- Right.
- We will take you to the station.

795
01:20:54,430 --> 01:20:55,870
Have you seen Taylor?

796
01:20:56,329 --> 01:21:01,081
Not yet. Please check the roof and
stairs, then back.

797
01:21:01,549 --> 01:21:04,313
See you there, I address issues
locally.

798
01:21:05,283 --> 01:21:08,287
- But there is an order, sir.
- As I said, is local.

799
01:21:08,288 --> 01:21:09,740
I will call if I need them.

800
01:21:10,141 --> 01:21:11,684
Agreed.

801
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:16,409
Really did not think you
go out with yours, do you?

802
01:21:16,410 --> 01:21:20,257
I swear if I am arrested,
you crawl to me.

803
01:21:20,606 --> 01:21:22,865
I can describe every detail
your home.

804
01:21:22,866 --> 01:21:26,023
I am a police officer, do you think
someone will believe you?

805
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:27,858
Yes, I do.

806
01:21:30,071 --> 01:21:35,296
Glamour got, I gave it,
or you would not know how to hold your cup.

807
01:21:36,452 --> 01:21:38,026
Now what, Warwick.

808
01:21:38,127 --> 01:21:41,566
Well, assuming you have the
money, we can reach an agreement.

809
01:21:41,667 --> 01:21:44,070
Or you just shot
while trying to escape.

810
01:21:44,678 --> 01:21:47,158
But you've never fired
nobody does it?

811
01:21:47,359 --> 01:21:48,760
Have not I done?

812
01:21:48,761 --> 01:21:51,992
It depends on you. My detectives
will fall at any minute.

813
01:22:17,081 --> 01:22:21,691
The costumes are elaborate.
This will be useful at the border.

814
01:22:24,986 --> 01:22:26,146
Thank you.

815
01:22:26,525 --> 01:22:31,822
No need to thank me, John.
You did everything very entertaining.

816
01:22:33,123 --> 01:22:34,420
Bon voyage.

817
01:23:39,805 --> 01:23:41,552
Beware!

818
01:24:02,648 --> 01:24:04,546
I've been thinking
John Taylor.

819
01:24:05,847 --> 01:24:08,171
Oh yeah?
What about him?

820
01:24:08,272 --> 01:24:13,628
In the parking lot ...
I was surprised that got away.

821
01:24:14,129 --> 01:24:17,127
Yeah, well. I guess
I'm getting old.

822
01:24:18,092 --> 01:24:20,179
I wonder where it went.

823
01:24:20,791 --> 01:24:23,699
It's been a couple of months, you should
have crossed the country.

824
01:24:26,163 --> 01:24:27,986
Or left the country.

825
01:24:28,087 --> 01:24:29,237
Could be.

826
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:33,821
Do not feel bad about it,
Taylor is worse out there.

827
01:24:34,541 --> 01:24:37,512
And it is to be held on trial
Simone De Marchi, right?

828
01:24:38,198 --> 01:24:39,938
You did a good job there.

829
01:24:41,542 --> 01:24:44,650
- Never met him before, right?
- A Taylor?

830
01:24:44,651 --> 01:24:45,751
No.

831
01:24:45,752 --> 01:24:46,902
Never?

832
01:24:47,709 --> 01:24:49,590
Of course not,
Why?

833
01:24:49,591 --> 01:24:54,199
I thought maybe I would have
crusader, he has previous convictions,

834
01:24:54,803 --> 01:24:56,842
maybe you met him at the station.

835
01:24:58,123 --> 01:25:00,561
And I never met him socially,
Right?

836
01:25:02,118 --> 01:25:05,337
He is not exactly
My circle detective.

837
01:25:05,638 --> 01:25:06,973
So ...

838
01:25:10,586 --> 01:25:12,544
This may be shocking.

839
01:25:18,015 --> 01:25:19,707
My God.

840
01:25:22,370 --> 01:25:26,030
It's disturbing, right?

841
01:25:27,931 --> 01:25:30,220
I think technology
is getting out of control.

842
01:25:30,221 --> 01:25:32,495
- What?
- If someone like Taylor ...

843
01:25:32,496 --> 01:25:34,566
can do something as professional
like this ...

844
01:25:34,567 --> 01:25:37,538
Wait. Are you suggesting
Taylor produced this?

845
01:25:37,805 --> 01:25:38,811
Sure.

846
01:25:38,812 --> 01:25:43,932
It is a Polaroid. An exhibition
positive, not an invention in Photoshop.

847
01:25:43,933 --> 01:25:46,355
It must be, what other explanation
would?

848
01:25:46,456 --> 01:25:48,509
Besides the obvious?

849
01:25:48,904 --> 01:25:52,020
Ben, I know for how much,
10.

850
01:25:52,548 --> 01:25:54,249
- Six.
- Six years.

851
01:25:54,441 --> 01:25:57,409
Do you really think that I associate
with this man?

852
01:25:58,680 --> 01:25:59,992
I can not ignore.

853
01:26:01,581 --> 01:26:04,255
Sorry, Warwick, I send
to analyze that.

854
01:26:04,256 --> 01:26:08,041
Good. I wonder also
how they did it.

855
01:26:10,689 --> 01:26:13,057
- The other thing is ...
- Yes.

856
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:19,095
One witness testified that Taylor
tried to enter his house after the robbery.

857
01:26:19,521 --> 01:26:25,231
He said he saw him again in the
morning, outside the house of his neighbor.

858
01:26:25,869 --> 01:26:27,366
It's your house.

859
01:26:32,607 --> 01:26:34,511
Is the lady who lives next to me?

860
01:26:34,723 --> 01:26:35,850
Yes.

861
01:26:36,131 --> 01:26:41,330
Morton, you know how many times called
woman to the station?

862
01:26:41,952 --> 01:26:43,840
the woman is insane.

863
01:26:44,523 --> 01:26:46,647
Yes. I know it.

864
01:26:47,082 --> 01:26:51,275
That's why we never took
seriously. Until now.

865
01:26:52,322 --> 01:26:54,055
It seems taken at home.

866
01:26:55,258 --> 01:26:58,532
It is a white sofa.

867
01:26:59,266 --> 01:27:04,214
Why you? If false, why
put you in the picture?

868
01:27:04,385 --> 01:27:05,796
He mocks us.

869
01:27:06,246 --> 01:27:07,820
Where did your picture?

870
01:27:08,047 --> 01:27:11,294
Newspapers, Christmas party
last year.

871
01:27:12,214 --> 01:27:15,574
You are who showed me his record
and resources do you?

872
01:27:16,821 --> 01:27:19,416
Tomorrow will probably be a
Polaroid of you and him,

873
01:27:19,417 --> 01:27:21,512
sitting together in a
fucking bathtub.

874
01:27:26,162 --> 01:27:27,305
Yes.

875
01:27:32,384 --> 01:27:33,593
Except ...

876
01:27:37,711 --> 01:27:39,553
Except that, Ben.

877
01:27:39,554 --> 01:27:42,704
Would be failing in the rules
if you do not investigate this.

878
01:27:43,567 --> 01:27:46,273
And you should.
You're a good detective.

879
01:27:46,820 --> 01:27:48,875
Now excuse me.

880
01:27:51,472 --> 01:27:53,724
I need to look
your home.

881
01:27:59,647 --> 01:28:01,166
All right.

882
01:28:01,488 --> 01:28:02,861
Okay, fine.

883
01:28:06,073 --> 01:28:07,212
You know,

884
01:28:07,513 --> 01:28:12,228
Ben, I appreciate your responsibility,
must have been hard to come talk to me,

885
01:28:12,229 --> 01:28:15,514
but what actually sent
a group of police to my house?

886
01:28:16,918 --> 01:28:19,653
- Ignoring it is not the solution.
- I agree.

887
01:28:20,189 --> 01:28:21,426
So.

888
01:28:21,938 --> 01:28:24,146
What you have in mind?

889
01:28:25,337 --> 01:28:27,143
How about dinner?

890
01:28:29,090 --> 01:28:30,172
When?

891
01:28:30,173 --> 01:28:34,554
Come tonight. Now I have friends
to come, I cook.

892
01:28:34,822 --> 01:28:37,711
It will be fun. You
comb the entire place.

893
01:28:38,619 --> 01:28:40,978
Now I have something in mind something
official.

894
01:28:41,468 --> 01:28:44,274
I'm being polite, Ben.
I have not to be.

895
01:28:45,625 --> 01:28:47,807
I would like to maintain our friendship.

896
01:28:49,269 --> 01:28:50,555
Agreed.

897
01:28:50,756 --> 01:28:52,605
- Dinner sounds good.
- Very good.

898
01:28:53,226 --> 01:28:55,171
- At 8 o'clock?
- Sure.

899
01:28:59,792 --> 01:29:01,193
Oh and Ben,

900
01:29:02,122 --> 01:29:03,764
Do you drink red wine or white?

901
01:29:04,850 --> 01:29:06,335
Oh, red.

902
01:29:07,324 --> 01:29:08,824
Fantastic.

903
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:28,000
