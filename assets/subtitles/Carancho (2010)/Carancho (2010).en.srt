1
00:01:27,931 --> 00:01:30,525
22 DEATHS A DAY,
683 A MONTH, OVER 8,000 A YEAR,

2
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:32,294
OVER THE LAST DECADE,

3
00:01:32,402 --> 00:01:34,199
IN ARGENTINA, TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS

4
00:01:34,304 --> 00:01:36,101
ARE DECIMATING
THOSE 35 AND UNDER.

5
00:01:36,206 --> 00:01:37,867
THE COMPENSATION MARKET
IS BOOMING.

6
00:01:40,343 --> 00:01:42,174
C'mon, you son of a bitch!

7
00:01:42,278 --> 00:01:44,746
- Come over here.
- Shut up and walk.

8
00:01:44,848 --> 00:01:47,078
- How d'you know my dad?
- From soccer.

9
00:01:47,183 --> 00:01:49,777
- Oh yeah? Which club?
- Morón.

10
00:01:51,154 --> 00:01:53,918
- Which club, son of a bitch?
- Stop it...

11
00:01:54,023 --> 00:01:55,615
- Which club?
- Almirante Brown.

12
00:01:55,725 --> 00:01:56,783
What?

13
00:01:56,893 --> 00:02:00,090
Son of a bitch!
Which club was my father in?

14
00:02:00,263 --> 00:02:01,696
Which team?

15
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:05,600
Which club was my father in,
piece of shit?

16
00:02:05,702 --> 00:02:07,101
Laferrere.

17
00:02:12,408 --> 00:02:15,070
- Can't remember?
- I'm not sure...

18
00:02:16,346 --> 00:02:19,247
Couldn't wait 'til after the burial,

19
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:21,544
swindling fucker.
Let's go!

20
00:02:22,252 --> 00:02:24,516
Respect the dead,
son of a bitch!

21
00:02:24,621 --> 00:02:28,352
- Fucking vulture!
- Let's get out of here.

22
00:02:56,853 --> 00:02:58,411
Ready, Luján?

23
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:08,063
Hurry up, please!

24
00:03:09,132 --> 00:03:10,258
Coming.

25
00:04:26,743 --> 00:04:28,836
Come on, hurry it up!

26
00:04:42,058 --> 00:04:45,289
FUNERAL HOME

27
00:05:01,744 --> 00:05:03,507
Do you copy, Sosa?

28
00:05:03,613 --> 00:05:07,413
Motorbike-truck collision
on Mosconi and Villegas.

29
00:05:17,193 --> 00:05:18,717
Take it easy.

30
00:05:22,265 --> 00:05:23,289
They're coming.

31
00:05:27,904 --> 00:05:30,134
I see him, over there.

32
00:05:35,678 --> 00:05:37,305
Bring the stretcher, Pico.

33
00:05:44,754 --> 00:05:46,153
Good evening.

34
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:49,881
What happened?

35
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:55,057
He crossed in front of the truck.

36
00:05:56,132 --> 00:05:58,930
Strong blow to the head,
no helmet.

37
00:05:59,035 --> 00:06:02,471
- Do you know if he's drunk?
- Doesn't smell of alcohol.

38
00:06:02,572 --> 00:06:05,700
- Do you know his name?
- I think it's Gustavo.

39
00:06:06,109 --> 00:06:07,508
Loss of consciousness?

40
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,635
He was speaking up until now.

41
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:12,942
- Gustavo, do you hear me?
- Yes.

42
00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:15,383
I'm a doctor, okay?

43
00:06:15,485 --> 00:06:19,649
This is a neck brace.
We're taking you to the hospital.

44
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:22,280
- Do you remember what happened?
- No.

45
00:06:22,391 --> 00:06:24,951
You don't? Nothing at all?

46
00:06:25,061 --> 00:06:27,029
How old are you, Gustavo?

47
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:29,064
24.

48
00:06:29,165 --> 00:06:32,464
- Were you working?
- Yes.

49
00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:35,332
Stay calm.

50
00:06:35,438 --> 00:06:36,962
Can you help me
with the stretcher?

51
00:06:37,073 --> 00:06:39,667
Put his head down
and come beside me.

52
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:41,307
I have my first aid certificate.

53
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,241
Good.

54
00:06:43,346 --> 00:06:45,337
Put one hand over here...

55
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:47,678
and hold the other one here.

56
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:50,411
On my count of three,
we'll move him.

57
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,784
Ready? One, two, three.

58
00:06:53,356 --> 00:06:54,584
Stay calm.

59
00:06:54,724 --> 00:06:58,387
Okay. One, two, three.
We put him down. Good.

60
00:06:58,494 --> 00:06:59,927
There we go!

61
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:02,429
Officer, can you help me please?

62
00:07:02,732 --> 00:07:04,097
Are you okay?

63
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,224
Me?

64
00:07:05,334 --> 00:07:07,302
More or less, yes.

65
00:07:07,403 --> 00:07:11,897
- Were you driving?
- No, it's something else.

66
00:07:12,008 --> 00:07:13,066
Let's see...

67
00:07:13,176 --> 00:07:14,939
- Stay still.
- Let's go, Luján.

68
00:07:15,044 --> 00:07:18,309
- You need stitches.
- Thank you.

69
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,211
Pico...

70
00:07:23,252 --> 00:07:25,652
- Do you know him?
- What?

71
00:07:25,755 --> 00:07:28,849
That guy who just helped us.
Do you know him?

72
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,186
Yes...

73
00:07:30,293 --> 00:07:31,624
Why?

74
00:07:31,727 --> 00:07:33,126
He's following us.

75
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:36,289
Don't worry.
He's coming to the clinic with us.

76
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,176
- So?
- They won't admit him.

77
00:07:47,276 --> 00:07:49,972
- Why?
- How should I know?

78
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:53,446
No one's on call,
the place is a mess. Usual bullshit.

79
00:07:53,549 --> 00:07:56,040
- She's trying to get him in.
- Who is she?

80
00:07:56,152 --> 00:07:59,451
She's new.
Sister of a friend of mine.

81
00:08:01,424 --> 00:08:04,086
You have an IC unit
and a CAT scan here.

82
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:06,559
I'm sorry, I can't admit him.

83
00:08:06,662 --> 00:08:10,120
I'm not taking him anywhere,
so work it out.

84
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:12,724
Talk to your supervisor.

85
00:08:12,835 --> 00:08:14,803
- Excuse me.
- Good evening.

86
00:08:14,904 --> 00:08:17,930
- Is Russo in today?
- Yes, he is.

87
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,304
Can you call him over?

88
00:08:22,144 --> 00:08:23,839
I'll go see.

89
00:08:24,413 --> 00:08:26,142
What about me?

90
00:08:26,716 --> 00:08:28,809
You wait.

91
00:08:31,087 --> 00:08:32,884
Gustavo, are you okay?

92
00:08:37,593 --> 00:08:39,754
I can't believe this...

93
00:08:39,862 --> 00:08:41,523
Don't worry.

94
00:08:48,604 --> 00:08:50,162
Excuse me.

95
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:05,281
Pico, I'll leave the chart
and meet you outside.

96
00:09:15,898 --> 00:09:18,025
- Everything okay?
- Yes, thanks.

97
00:09:18,134 --> 00:09:19,499
Any problems?

98
00:09:19,602 --> 00:09:21,467
No, everything's fine.

99
00:09:21,804 --> 00:09:24,170
- Thanks for helping.
- You're welcome.

100
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,535
Can I have your name?

101
00:09:26,642 --> 00:09:28,132
Olivera.

102
00:09:28,244 --> 00:09:31,577
- Your first name?
- Luján, Luján Olivera.

103
00:09:32,381 --> 00:09:34,508
- Need my license?
- No, this is fine.

104
00:09:34,617 --> 00:09:37,211
Here, just in case.

105
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,948
Keep it, you never know.
See you.

106
00:09:40,056 --> 00:09:42,650
Thanks, Sosa, I mean it.
Bye.

107
00:09:58,307 --> 00:10:01,299
How long have you known Sosa?

108
00:10:01,644 --> 00:10:04,943
- Long enough.
- How long is long enough?

109
00:10:05,047 --> 00:10:08,676
Enough is like 8 or 10 years.

110
00:10:08,784 --> 00:10:11,514
- Always been a "vulture"?
- No.

111
00:10:12,355 --> 00:10:14,983
No, he started
when he lost his license.

112
00:10:15,091 --> 00:10:17,821
Started working for
those Foundation assholes.

113
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,888
First, you get 200 bucks for the tip.

114
00:10:21,697 --> 00:10:23,824
If it turns into a case.

115
00:10:23,933 --> 00:10:25,833
Do the clients get paid?

116
00:10:25,935 --> 00:10:28,802
It's a swindle,
but they get some money.

117
00:10:28,904 --> 00:10:32,806
These people don't have
medical coverage or jobs.

118
00:10:32,908 --> 00:10:36,901
The Foundation ends up
being like social work for them.

119
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:38,912
Social work?

120
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:41,209
Yes, social work.

121
00:10:41,684 --> 00:10:43,914
For someone lying under a bus

122
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:46,317
at 4 a.m., with broken bones,

123
00:10:46,422 --> 00:10:48,219
it's the best they can get.

124
00:10:48,324 --> 00:10:52,351
A vulture who'll help them
screw the insurance company.

125
00:11:30,933 --> 00:11:33,060
We're almost there.

126
00:11:41,977 --> 00:11:44,207
Tell me what they hit you with.

127
00:11:44,313 --> 00:11:47,976
I don't know,
I was going home and they hit me.

128
00:11:48,284 --> 00:11:51,549
I hurt my head
when I fell to the ground.

129
00:11:51,654 --> 00:11:55,146
It hurts up here too, doctor.

130
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:57,452
But do you remember
what happened?

131
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,495
Sort of, sort of.

132
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:03,429
- You are a cop.
- No, I'm a doctor.

133
00:12:03,532 --> 00:12:05,591
Try to calm down, okay?

134
00:12:05,701 --> 00:12:07,726
I'm here to take care of you,

135
00:12:07,837 --> 00:12:10,601
to stop the bleeding on your head.

136
00:12:10,706 --> 00:12:13,402
When we get to the hospital,
they'll take over.

137
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:16,444
- I'm leaving.
- Not now, we're driving.

138
00:12:16,545 --> 00:12:19,446
Once we reach the hospital
you're free to leave.

139
00:12:19,548 --> 00:12:21,379
- I love you!
- That's nice, just relax.

140
00:12:21,484 --> 00:12:25,853
Stay seated, nice and easy.
Stay put.

141
00:12:26,989 --> 00:12:27,978
Watch it.

142
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:30,888
Get your hands off me
and try to relax.

143
00:12:30,993 --> 00:12:31,960
Bitch.

144
00:12:32,061 --> 00:12:34,154
Bitch? What's the matter with you?

145
00:12:34,263 --> 00:12:36,094
Stay put, calm down!

146
00:12:36,198 --> 00:12:39,429
- Stay put!
- Bitch!

147
00:12:41,403 --> 00:12:42,392
Give me a kiss.

148
00:12:42,505 --> 00:12:44,905
Come with me.
I'll give you a kiss.

149
00:12:45,007 --> 00:12:49,068
Calm down! Let go of me!

150
00:13:29,985 --> 00:13:31,282
Okay.

151
00:13:31,387 --> 00:13:33,184
Try to remember the details.

152
00:13:33,289 --> 00:13:35,257
There was a witness, right?

153
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:38,884
A neighbor saw it all,
he said it was the trucker's fault.

154
00:13:38,994 --> 00:13:43,363
His lights were off
and he was driving the wrong way.

155
00:13:44,633 --> 00:13:48,399
He didn't have time to swerve,
counselor.

156
00:13:48,504 --> 00:13:50,995
They said it was an accident.

157
00:13:51,106 --> 00:13:53,666
If it could have been avoided,

158
00:13:54,043 --> 00:13:56,534
it's not an accident,
it's an incident.

159
00:13:57,079 --> 00:13:59,604
The police took photos of the car.

160
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:01,615
I'm not sure, I guess so...

161
00:14:01,717 --> 00:14:05,346
- Did you file a formal complaint?
- Yes, I did.

162
00:14:05,454 --> 00:14:07,012
Where is it?

163
00:14:07,656 --> 00:14:09,954
I think my wife has it at home.

164
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:13,187
- Who came to your aid?
- Policemen.

165
00:14:13,295 --> 00:14:16,958
As they drove by, they saw me
staggering out of the car.

166
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:20,001
- They took you to the hospital?
- They did.

167
00:14:20,369 --> 00:14:21,802
Who treated you there?

168
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:25,738
Can't say.
A doctor, wearing green or white.

169
00:14:25,841 --> 00:14:27,809
- You got X-rays?
- Yes.

170
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,470
- Hey, Sosa.
- Do you have the X-rays?

171
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:33,776
- It won't hold in court.
- It's not my fault.

172
00:14:33,882 --> 00:14:37,875
Ask Guerrero for 20 points.
Why didn't you sign it?

173
00:14:39,722 --> 00:14:41,815
What's so difficult, Casal?

174
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:43,915
What happened to your face?

175
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,425
It's nothing.

176
00:14:46,528 --> 00:14:48,962
You have to take me with you.

177
00:14:49,365 --> 00:14:51,833
What's the Dog doing here?

178
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:53,333
Are you comatose?

179
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:56,563
- What more could you ask for?
- Fuck off!

180
00:14:56,672 --> 00:15:01,109
You have subordinates,
a car, an office, a secretary...

181
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,378
You're here
because I want you to be.

182
00:15:03,412 --> 00:15:05,573
This document authorizes us

183
00:15:05,681 --> 00:15:09,048
to handle the case.

184
00:15:09,151 --> 00:15:12,985
I don't know.
I can't believe this is happening.

185
00:15:13,322 --> 00:15:15,517
I don't know what to do, counselor.

186
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:16,784
We take care of everything.

187
00:15:16,892 --> 00:15:18,484
Yes, I know, but...

188
00:15:18,594 --> 00:15:22,052
My neighbors say you're good,
but I'm not sure.

189
00:15:22,164 --> 00:15:23,597
One step at a time.

190
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:25,530
Check the Police Station!

191
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:27,226
That's where you get screwed!

192
00:15:27,336 --> 00:15:30,237
No, the real problem
comes from here!

193
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:32,102
Calm down.

194
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:37,911
Counselor Casal,
could I have a minute?

195
00:15:38,013 --> 00:15:41,176
This is Mr. Arrieta's widow.

196
00:15:41,283 --> 00:15:44,218
The accident on Mármol Street.

197
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:49,814
We're very sorry for your loss.
And we hope we can be of service.

198
00:15:50,392 --> 00:15:52,189
Wake up.

199
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:55,228
I'll wait for you outside.

200
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,867
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?

201
00:16:06,975 --> 00:16:10,069
- What do we have?
- Traffic accident.

202
00:16:14,383 --> 00:16:15,645
Thank you.

203
00:16:15,751 --> 00:16:17,082
Pico...

204
00:16:18,954 --> 00:16:20,182
Ready?

205
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:26,222
I told you it was
like 20 blocks that way.

206
00:16:26,328 --> 00:16:30,025
Alright already! We'll be there soon.

207
00:16:32,468 --> 00:16:34,834
Put your seatbelt on, Pico.

208
00:16:42,811 --> 00:16:46,247
Yes, I'm better now.

209
00:16:46,348 --> 00:16:49,010
But I might turn up
shot in the head any time now.

210
00:16:49,118 --> 00:16:52,713
Be careful.
The Dog knows you're up to something.

211
00:16:52,821 --> 00:16:56,279
We've been through this
a thousand times. I've had it.

212
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,120
You can't leave, not now.

213
00:16:58,227 --> 00:17:00,286
Take a good look at me.

214
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:01,521
I can't take it anymore.

215
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:05,361
So you're tired!
Then I'll go out, like we used to do.

216
00:17:05,467 --> 00:17:07,264
I'm not talking about today.

217
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:09,064
I've been tired a long time.

218
00:17:09,171 --> 00:17:11,765
I'm just as tired as you are.

219
00:17:11,874 --> 00:17:15,002
Do I have to tell you
how sick I am of the Dog?

220
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:17,237
He refuses the slightest change!

221
00:17:17,346 --> 00:17:18,540
That's not my problem.

222
00:17:18,647 --> 00:17:21,445
As soon as I get my license back,
I'm out.

223
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,518
Today, I'll talk to Rinaldi.

224
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:25,553
I need you beside me!

225
00:17:26,021 --> 00:17:28,046
Wait,
do you want to leave or stay?

226
00:17:28,157 --> 00:17:30,091
No one's throwing me out.

227
00:17:30,192 --> 00:17:32,524
The one leaving is the Dog.

228
00:17:32,628 --> 00:17:36,223
Rinaldi wants his ass,
he told me so.

229
00:17:36,665 --> 00:17:39,634
How much longer can he resist?

230
00:17:39,735 --> 00:17:43,535
He's done for.
Who's next in line?

231
00:17:43,872 --> 00:17:46,170
Don't underestimate the Dog.

232
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:48,539
You listen to me,

233
00:17:48,911 --> 00:17:52,278
we have to stick together now.

234
00:17:56,251 --> 00:17:57,912
C'mon, man...

235
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,352
You really want my head?

236
00:18:03,025 --> 00:18:05,960
They buy it from you,
not me.

237
00:18:20,909 --> 00:18:23,400
Mr. Moyano,
the taxi company called,

238
00:18:23,512 --> 00:18:25,412
the car's running late.

239
00:18:25,514 --> 00:18:27,641
Excuse me, I'm not Moyano.

240
00:18:27,749 --> 00:18:30,377
Sorry,
Mr. Moyano had a traffic accident.

241
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:33,818
I'm his attorney,
but I haven't met him in person.

242
00:18:34,223 --> 00:18:36,623
I had an accident, too.

243
00:18:36,725 --> 00:18:38,283
Really?
What happened?

244
00:18:38,393 --> 00:18:41,089
A son of a bitch
ran me over with his truck.

245
00:18:41,196 --> 00:18:42,686
- When was that?
- Yesterday.

246
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:44,197
- Did you get X-rays?
- Yes.

247
00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:46,130
Can I see them?

248
00:18:57,546 --> 00:18:59,241
She was going to work.

249
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:02,215
A car leaving a nightclub
ran her lover.

250
00:19:02,317 --> 00:19:04,649
- At what time?
- At dawn.

251
00:19:04,753 --> 00:19:09,452
- Married? Any children?
- Yes, married, two children.

252
00:19:11,426 --> 00:19:13,053
Do you know the husband?

253
00:19:13,161 --> 00:19:15,129
Yes, he's on his way.

254
00:19:32,481 --> 00:19:34,948
You left some stuff
here yesterday, Sosa.

255
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,211
Stop by headquarters.

256
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:39,253
Roger that, I'm coming.

257
00:19:39,354 --> 00:19:40,912
I'll wait for you.

258
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:56,127
Evening. Hi, Sosa.

259
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:58,570
- Here's the paperwork.
- Good.

260
00:20:06,148 --> 00:20:08,241
What's the story on Almafuerte Ave.?

261
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:11,478
Female, 82 years old,

262
00:20:11,954 --> 00:20:13,182
high blood pressure,

263
00:20:13,288 --> 00:20:15,449
suffered a hypertensive crisis.

264
00:20:15,557 --> 00:20:18,287
- Six victims, total.
- Good evening.

265
00:20:18,393 --> 00:20:20,156
- Hi there, Pico.
- Who's hungry?

266
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:22,526
- Remember the Mosconi St. Guy?
- Who?

267
00:20:22,631 --> 00:20:24,826
The one who hit a cyclist.

268
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:28,528
Yeah. He had some kind of trouble
with his bank

269
00:20:28,637 --> 00:20:31,970
and his insurance policy went unpaid.

270
00:20:32,074 --> 00:20:35,100
The same day,
he hit and killed this guy on a bike.

271
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:38,077
- Rotten luck!
- Bet the cyclist ran a light.

272
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,910
Someone is always to blame.

273
00:20:41,016 --> 00:20:45,476
Sure, but insurance companies pay
because an accident is an accident.

274
00:20:45,587 --> 00:20:48,147
And that lady
from the driving school.

275
00:20:48,256 --> 00:20:51,350
A driving instructor,
with years of experience.

276
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,257
One day, she's driving a long,

277
00:20:53,362 --> 00:20:55,887
when right in front of her windshield

278
00:20:55,998 --> 00:20:59,900
this guy drops dead,
hit by a falling flowerpot.

279
00:21:00,002 --> 00:21:03,460
She's so distressed,
she has a heart attack right there.

280
00:21:03,572 --> 00:21:07,565
So her car keeps going,
runs up the sidewalk

281
00:21:07,676 --> 00:21:10,167
and hits this kid,
her own nephew...

282
00:21:10,278 --> 00:21:13,008
- Bullshit!
- No, this stuff happens!

283
00:21:13,115 --> 00:21:16,175
The unit's on its way.
Ready to go, guys?

284
00:21:16,284 --> 00:21:18,275
There's nothing for you, Sosa.
See ya.

285
00:21:18,387 --> 00:21:19,615
See ya.

286
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,555
Luján!

287
00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:27,228
- Everything okay?
- Yes.

288
00:21:27,529 --> 00:21:30,225
I don't do malpractice.

289
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:33,062
It takes forever,
you never see the money.

290
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:35,033
I don't mess with doctors.

291
00:21:36,471 --> 00:21:38,439
Good to know.

292
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:41,202
How can I change
the way you look at me?

293
00:21:41,309 --> 00:21:45,973
- Meaning?
- I don't know. Like I scare you.

294
00:21:46,081 --> 00:21:48,174
I'm not afraid of you.

295
00:21:53,588 --> 00:21:56,022
Do you like working here?

296
00:21:56,591 --> 00:21:58,957
Yes, I do.

297
00:22:00,095 --> 00:22:03,292
But I don't plan
to be on call all my life.

298
00:22:03,398 --> 00:22:06,925
Right. You're waiting
for a better opportunity.

299
00:22:07,969 --> 00:22:10,369
- Something like that.
- Me too.

300
00:22:11,206 --> 00:22:13,333
What are you waiting for?

301
00:22:13,442 --> 00:22:15,467
A multiple colision?

302
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:19,108
No, I'm not sure...

303
00:22:19,214 --> 00:22:21,716
A change of scenery,

304
00:22:21,716 --> 00:22:23,980
getting out of here...

305
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:27,015
I'm not really sure.

306
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:32,251
Truth is, since I started
bumping into you regularly,

307
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,851
I'm considering staying here.

308
00:22:36,998 --> 00:22:40,297
- Is that your pick up line?
- No, it's the truth.

309
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:43,064
- I'm not very good at...
- Ready, Luján?

310
00:22:44,306 --> 00:22:46,171
I have to go.

311
00:22:46,274 --> 00:22:48,765
What time do you finish...

312
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:51,302
your shift?

313
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:52,744
Coming!

314
00:22:52,848 --> 00:22:55,976
At 8.
But I may leave a bit early.

315
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:58,075
Can I wait for you?

316
00:23:00,555 --> 00:23:03,080
Sure. If you like.

317
00:23:03,391 --> 00:23:05,951
- I'll wait for you.
- Okay.

318
00:23:56,311 --> 00:23:58,802
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, and you?

319
00:23:58,914 --> 00:24:00,575
- I'm done.
- Did it go well?

320
00:24:00,682 --> 00:24:02,741
Yeah, but I'm kind of tired.

321
00:24:02,851 --> 00:24:04,910
I should get some sleep,
I guess.

322
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:08,615
Can I buy you a coffee here?
Five minutes?

323
00:24:08,723 --> 00:24:11,851
You graduated,
did your residency there,

324
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:16,056
and since positions were rare,
Pico helped you get this job.

325
00:24:16,364 --> 00:24:18,559
That's not so bad.

326
00:24:20,335 --> 00:24:22,098
What about you?

327
00:24:23,205 --> 00:24:25,196
What about me?

328
00:24:25,941 --> 00:24:28,239
What did you do
to lose your license?

329
00:24:29,311 --> 00:24:31,142
Nothing.

330
00:24:32,247 --> 00:24:35,614
- Nothing?
- No. It was bad luck, that's all.

331
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:38,509
Really?

332
00:24:40,155 --> 00:24:42,715
But I'm pretty sure...

333
00:24:42,824 --> 00:24:45,258
it's changing.

334
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,960
- What's changing?
- My luck.

335
00:24:48,063 --> 00:24:49,758
Why?

336
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:52,162
See that traffic light?

337
00:24:53,168 --> 00:24:55,136
That one.

338
00:24:56,404 --> 00:25:00,500
If two cars run the red light,
I'll kiss you.

339
00:25:01,076 --> 00:25:04,773
- Are you crazy?
- No, it's just a game.

340
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:08,474
Just to show you
my luck is changing.

341
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:12,181
- Two is too easy.
- Would you go for three?

342
00:25:12,287 --> 00:25:14,380
Ten.

343
00:25:14,956 --> 00:25:17,117
That's unreasonable
and you know it.

344
00:25:17,225 --> 00:25:19,056
It's 6 a.m.

345
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,787
Okay, four.

346
00:25:20,895 --> 00:25:23,295
Four is a lot.

347
00:25:24,099 --> 00:25:26,624
Four... Let's see.

348
00:25:29,337 --> 00:25:32,272
Help me out here, people.

349
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:36,243
Here comes the first.

350
00:25:36,711 --> 00:25:39,839
Yes.

351
00:25:40,181 --> 00:25:41,910
Two.

352
00:25:43,618 --> 00:25:46,348
Two... Good job.

353
00:25:46,788 --> 00:25:49,052
- Trucks don't count.
- Yes, they do.

354
00:25:49,157 --> 00:25:51,751
Three, four...

355
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,827
Five!

356
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:54,861
I made it!

357
00:25:54,963 --> 00:25:57,124
And not a single truck.

358
00:25:59,968 --> 00:26:03,301
- I won't kiss you, though.
- I'll kiss you, then.

359
00:26:03,405 --> 00:26:06,397
- I have to go.
- I'm in a tough spot.

360
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:11,170
Should I close it?

361
00:29:10,191 --> 00:29:11,715
Can you finish it for today?

362
00:29:11,826 --> 00:29:14,158
Sure.

363
00:29:14,863 --> 00:29:17,161
"La Superior," good insurance.

364
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:22,599
Is it still valid?

365
00:29:23,404 --> 00:29:24,996
Yes...

366
00:29:26,741 --> 00:29:28,834
Alright.
How much do you want for it?

367
00:29:28,943 --> 00:29:32,276
500 bucks plus repairs
and we have a deal.

368
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:35,872
"I hereby authorize
payment of the amount,

369
00:29:35,984 --> 00:29:38,782
as stated
in the agreement de quota litis,

370
00:29:38,887 --> 00:29:42,789
and to be deducted
from the final damages obtained.

371
00:29:42,891 --> 00:29:46,054
Two equal documents
are signed as proof of conformity."

372
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,559
When do I get the rest?

373
00:29:47,662 --> 00:29:49,721
Like I said, you have to wait.

374
00:29:49,831 --> 00:29:53,767
I know, but only...

375
00:29:56,871 --> 00:29:58,998
Finish reading.
I'll be a minute.

376
00:30:02,911 --> 00:30:04,936
How much
do you want to give him?

377
00:30:05,246 --> 00:30:06,873
Give him 200 more.

378
00:30:07,916 --> 00:30:09,281
I met with Rinaldi.

379
00:30:09,384 --> 00:30:11,944
It's all I set.
You need to see him.

380
00:30:12,053 --> 00:30:15,386
- Same old story?
- Yes, I don't trust you.

381
00:30:15,657 --> 00:30:18,854
No place will treat you
better than we do, Sosa.

382
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:27,233
There you go, 200 more.

383
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:31,168
Thanks, man!
Thank you.

384
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:36,237
- What do I do now?
- Sign.

385
00:30:44,052 --> 00:30:45,986
I could do with a nice cold beer.

386
00:30:46,087 --> 00:30:49,420
Vega, you drunkard, sign.
We're doing it tonight.

387
00:31:30,131 --> 00:31:31,120
Hi.

388
00:31:31,232 --> 00:31:32,927
At last!

389
00:31:34,535 --> 00:31:36,332
Come here.

390
00:31:38,673 --> 00:31:40,197
Everything okay?

391
00:31:40,308 --> 00:31:42,071
Yes, fine.

392
00:31:43,177 --> 00:31:46,977
- What happened?
- Nothing. You fell asleep.

393
00:31:47,348 --> 00:31:48,576
Sorry.

394
00:31:48,683 --> 00:31:51,049
Don't worry.

395
00:31:51,152 --> 00:31:54,178
- How long did I sleep?
- Around 12 hours.

396
00:31:55,356 --> 00:31:57,347
Are you hungry?

397
00:31:59,661 --> 00:32:02,221
You're not a morning talker.

398
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:06,391
No, it's just that
I'm not very used to it.

399
00:32:12,407 --> 00:32:14,398
Want me to give you a hand?

400
00:32:14,709 --> 00:32:17,940
Chop more red pepper
and that zucchini.

401
00:32:19,013 --> 00:32:21,038
- This one?
- Right.

402
00:32:21,349 --> 00:32:23,010
Both.

403
00:32:27,321 --> 00:32:28,982
Like this?

404
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:30,489
Yes.

405
00:32:52,814 --> 00:32:54,441
Hi.

406
00:32:55,183 --> 00:32:58,209
- What are you doing here?
- Filling in.

407
00:32:58,319 --> 00:32:59,946
Where's Santillán?

408
00:33:00,054 --> 00:33:02,857
Not a clue,
I'll go get ready.

409
00:33:03,091 --> 00:33:07,084
Then, do a quick arpeggio
using thumb and nails.

410
00:33:07,195 --> 00:33:08,685
- Get it?
- Yes.

411
00:33:08,796 --> 00:33:12,698
The thumb, when pointing down,
strums the lower notes.

412
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,995
The rest of the hand...

413
00:33:15,103 --> 00:33:18,129
plays the higher notes.

414
00:33:18,239 --> 00:33:19,968
The third, second and first...

415
00:33:20,074 --> 00:33:23,237
Then, a quick arpeggio
using your thumb and nails.

416
00:33:23,344 --> 00:33:26,871
Thumb, hand, thumb, hand...

417
00:33:28,149 --> 00:33:29,741
Look at me.

418
00:33:29,851 --> 00:33:33,343
The secret to Samba
is in the strumming.

419
00:33:33,554 --> 00:33:36,182
I wish I knew
how to play an instrument.

420
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:38,588
- Do you play anything?
- No.

421
00:33:38,693 --> 00:33:40,024
You smell of alcohol.

422
00:33:40,128 --> 00:33:41,425
- No.
- Don't lie to me.

423
00:33:41,529 --> 00:33:43,292
No!

424
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:45,695
- C'mon! Are we done here?
- We're done.

425
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,859
Keep your leg straight.

426
00:33:49,403 --> 00:33:52,600
Little kids should learn
to play an instrument.

427
00:33:55,409 --> 00:33:57,104
Here, bite this.

428
00:33:58,513 --> 00:34:00,378
- What do you feel?
- Nothing...

429
00:34:00,481 --> 00:34:03,075
- Sure?
- Yes! Don't chicken out on me!

430
00:34:03,184 --> 00:34:05,618
Okay, here it goes.
Don't shout.

431
00:34:14,428 --> 00:34:16,521
Hang in there!

432
00:34:16,631 --> 00:34:18,189
C'mon, be strong!

433
00:34:18,299 --> 00:34:20,563
Don't shout or we're fucked.

434
00:34:25,406 --> 00:34:27,033
Listen to me!

435
00:34:27,141 --> 00:34:30,133
It's all you from here.
Remember what I told you?

436
00:34:30,244 --> 00:34:33,042
Don't look at him.
Vega, do you hear me?

437
00:34:33,147 --> 00:34:34,580
Yes!

438
00:34:34,682 --> 00:34:37,276
Okay, hang in there!

439
00:35:50,124 --> 00:35:51,455
What happened, dude?

440
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:56,519
He jumped out of nowhere!
This has never happened to me!

441
00:35:56,631 --> 00:35:59,395
- What did you do?
- He jumped at my windshield.

442
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,333
- Are you okay, sir?
- Can you hear me?

443
00:36:02,436 --> 00:36:05,200
I've been driving 30 years and
this never happened to me!

444
00:36:05,306 --> 00:36:07,140
Where are we going, Pico?

445
00:36:07,275 --> 00:36:08,799
To aid a victim.

446
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:11,037
But headquarters didn't radio us.

447
00:36:11,145 --> 00:36:15,013
It doesn't matter, Luján.
Just get ready, we're a most there.

448
00:36:32,767 --> 00:36:34,325
Hi.

449
00:36:35,002 --> 00:36:38,062
- What are you doing here?
- What? I'm working.

450
00:36:38,172 --> 00:36:40,732
- Of course, sorry.
- What happened?

451
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:45,704
I think he has
a skull and a leg fracture.

452
00:36:45,813 --> 00:36:48,805
- He's lost a lot of blood.
- Did it just happen?

453
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:51,646
A few minutes ago, not more.

454
00:36:51,752 --> 00:36:54,016
- Can I help?
- Yes.

455
00:36:54,121 --> 00:36:58,182
- Has he been unconscious since?
- Yes.

456
00:37:01,329 --> 00:37:03,422
Do you know his name?

457
00:37:04,198 --> 00:37:06,496
Vega, he's a friend.

458
00:37:09,737 --> 00:37:11,295
The stretcher.

459
00:37:11,906 --> 00:37:14,374
Put a hand here and the other there.

460
00:37:14,475 --> 00:37:17,740
Ready? One, two, three.
Let's go.

461
00:37:17,845 --> 00:37:19,642
One, two, three...

462
00:37:19,747 --> 00:37:21,874
- And down...
- Careful.

463
00:37:21,983 --> 00:37:24,213
Strap this around.

464
00:37:25,753 --> 00:37:28,119
Strap that one.

465
00:37:28,489 --> 00:37:32,152
That's good, let's lift him up.

466
00:37:32,727 --> 00:37:35,025
Can you explain what happened?

467
00:37:36,497 --> 00:37:38,431
Not now. Later.

468
00:37:38,766 --> 00:37:42,031
- Ready?
- One, two, three!

469
00:37:42,136 --> 00:37:43,967
I'll tell you everything later.

470
00:37:44,071 --> 00:37:46,539
- Take him in, Pico.
- I've got him.

471
00:37:48,075 --> 00:37:49,872
Come with me.

472
00:37:55,916 --> 00:37:58,441
What happened?

473
00:37:58,552 --> 00:38:00,520
Please, not now.
Later.

474
00:38:00,621 --> 00:38:02,282
Save him. Help me.

475
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:04,950
I swear I'll tell you everything.

476
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,385
Here, put these on.

477
00:38:08,496 --> 00:38:11,329
- What do I do?
- Put them on.

478
00:38:17,071 --> 00:38:19,198
Do you know what he took?

479
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:22,065
Tramadol and codeine.

480
00:38:22,176 --> 00:38:24,144
Why?

481
00:38:24,478 --> 00:38:26,446
So it wouldn't hurt.

482
00:38:26,547 --> 00:38:28,879
I don't get it, Sosa.

483
00:38:29,617 --> 00:38:32,780
I'll explain everything, alright?

484
00:38:32,887 --> 00:38:34,752
He's in arrest! Grab this!

485
00:38:34,855 --> 00:38:39,918
When I tell you to, press it twice.
Now, start.

486
00:38:40,995 --> 00:38:44,453
- How? Tell me.
- When I tell you, start pumping.

487
00:38:44,565 --> 00:38:47,796
One, two...
Pico! How far are we?

488
00:38:47,902 --> 00:38:51,065
- Six or seven minutes.
- Call to say he's in arrest.

489
00:38:51,172 --> 00:38:53,402
Unit 28 to base,

490
00:38:53,507 --> 00:38:57,910
I have a male around 65...

491
00:38:58,012 --> 00:38:59,104
Save him.

492
00:38:59,213 --> 00:39:01,511
Shut up, Sosa! Concentrate!
One, two!

493
00:39:01,615 --> 00:39:04,448
Estimated time of arrival...

494
00:39:04,552 --> 00:39:08,318
- [Recieved and understood.]
- Hang in there, man.

495
00:39:10,958 --> 00:39:12,653
Tell me what's going on.

496
00:39:14,028 --> 00:39:15,290
Traffic accident.

497
00:39:17,398 --> 00:39:20,526
Male, 65 years old...

498
00:39:20,634 --> 00:39:24,126
His vitals are out.

499
00:39:24,238 --> 00:39:26,001
We've been doing CPR
for 7 minutes.

500
00:39:26,107 --> 00:39:27,301
- Did you administer anything?
- No.

501
00:39:27,408 --> 00:39:29,308
Any known allergies
to medication?

502
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:31,139
I don't know.

503
00:39:31,245 --> 00:39:32,940
Please...

504
00:39:35,883 --> 00:39:39,785
Cardiac arrest, 65-year-old patient,
polytrauma...

505
00:39:44,558 --> 00:39:47,527
On my count of three...
One, two, three!

506
00:39:48,829 --> 00:39:50,660
Take the stretcher, Pico.

507
00:39:51,632 --> 00:39:53,463
Hook up the oxygen, please.

508
00:39:53,567 --> 00:39:56,593
- Plug it in here.
- Monitor!

509
00:39:57,505 --> 00:39:59,336
- Get me Vaseline.
- Monitor's on.

510
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,704
Put a line in, please.

511
00:40:01,809 --> 00:40:04,676
- Charging!
- Get me the oxygen.

512
00:40:06,013 --> 00:40:07,810
Step back! Discharge!

513
00:40:08,883 --> 00:40:10,976
Can I be of any help?

514
00:40:11,085 --> 00:40:14,350
Go by admissions
and write a summary, that's all.

515
00:40:15,256 --> 00:40:17,053
For intubation, please.

516
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,931
How is he?

517
00:40:29,236 --> 00:40:31,067
Luján, how is he?

518
00:40:31,605 --> 00:40:33,129
He is dead, Sosa.

519
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,073
What do you mean dead?

520
00:40:36,177 --> 00:40:37,940
He can't be dead!

521
00:40:38,045 --> 00:40:40,138
He is dead.
Get your hands off me!

522
00:40:40,247 --> 00:40:42,306
Understood? Hands off!

523
00:41:04,371 --> 00:41:06,202
Wait outside, please.

524
00:41:38,806 --> 00:41:40,330
Doctor?

525
00:41:40,741 --> 00:41:44,609
- Captain Ibáñez.
- Counse or Casal. Good evening.

526
00:41:44,712 --> 00:41:47,977
You intervened
on Morelli Street, right?

527
00:41:48,082 --> 00:41:51,813
I'd need a copy of that report,
please.

528
00:41:51,919 --> 00:41:54,581
Ask the admissions desk.
Excuse me.

529
00:41:54,688 --> 00:41:57,316
Don't worry, many thanks.

530
00:41:57,424 --> 00:42:01,360
We'll need your license number
and details about the accident.

531
00:42:01,462 --> 00:42:03,726
If you agreed to cooperate...

532
00:42:05,633 --> 00:42:08,568
He wanted to take care of you,
I won't abandon you.

533
00:42:08,669 --> 00:42:10,034
Excuse me.

534
00:42:11,105 --> 00:42:12,299
Calm down.

535
00:42:12,406 --> 00:42:16,137
We did all we could.
I'm very sorry, ma'am.

536
00:42:16,243 --> 00:42:18,108
Calm down...

537
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,639
- I can't believe this...
- Wait here.

538
00:42:21,749 --> 00:42:25,515
I have to settle something.
I'll be back.

539
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,314
- Luján!
- Sosa!

540
00:42:29,423 --> 00:42:31,914
- Hold on a sec.
- Sosa!

541
00:42:46,273 --> 00:42:48,969
Are you crazy,
dragging me into your schemes?

542
00:42:49,076 --> 00:42:51,943
It was just supposed to be
a broken leg.

543
00:42:52,046 --> 00:42:53,411
You've got to be kidding!

544
00:42:53,514 --> 00:42:56,278
I sign the papers.
You have nothing to lose!

545
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:58,283
- I'm going home.
- Wait!

546
00:42:58,385 --> 00:42:59,579
Get your hands off me.

547
00:42:59,687 --> 00:43:04,386
Okay, but this is very important!
What did they say?

548
00:43:04,491 --> 00:43:08,257
Sign no papers, make no statements.
I have to fix this myself.

549
00:43:08,362 --> 00:43:09,659
Fix what?

550
00:43:09,763 --> 00:43:12,755
You shouldn't have been involved.
Forgive me.

551
00:43:12,866 --> 00:43:15,562
I don't have anything to forgive.

552
00:43:17,404 --> 00:43:19,395
A man just died because of you.

553
00:43:19,506 --> 00:43:22,964
I know you don't believe me,
but I was doing Vega a favor.

554
00:43:23,077 --> 00:43:24,305
He needed the money.

555
00:43:24,411 --> 00:43:27,812
Things should've gone smoothly.

556
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:32,275
I don't know what to do.

557
00:43:32,653 --> 00:43:35,315
And I'm supposed to tell you?

558
00:43:35,422 --> 00:43:37,515
You're a big boy, Sosa.

559
00:43:38,659 --> 00:43:40,854
I don't want to see you again.

560
00:44:01,348 --> 00:44:03,145
There he is.

561
00:44:03,717 --> 00:44:06,015
C'mon, Sosa!

562
00:44:08,355 --> 00:44:10,880
C'mon, Sosa!

563
00:44:12,593 --> 00:44:14,618
C'mon!

564
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,931
- And him?
- Waiting for surgery.

565
00:44:55,469 --> 00:44:58,700
His labs are done.
He has abdominal pain.

566
00:44:58,806 --> 00:45:00,831
- Surgeon's on his way.
- Paged him?

567
00:45:00,941 --> 00:45:03,307
- Yes, shouldn't be long.
- Okay. And this one?

568
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:07,176
Male, fell at work.
Exposed fracture and cranial trauma.

569
00:45:07,281 --> 00:45:09,010
- X-rays?
- They're done.

570
00:45:09,116 --> 00:45:10,105
The scan?

571
00:45:10,217 --> 00:45:12,811
- Not yet.
- You didn't page trauma?

572
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:16,014
- This one?
- This guy apparently has TB.

573
00:45:16,123 --> 00:45:17,522
Let me see...

574
00:45:17,624 --> 00:45:18,921
Why isn't he in isolation?

575
00:45:19,026 --> 00:45:22,484
I wasn't attending.
There are no beds anyway.

576
00:45:22,596 --> 00:45:25,963
Would you be interested in
the Friday shift?

577
00:45:26,066 --> 00:45:29,297
- Yes, of course.
- You don't look it.

578
00:45:29,403 --> 00:45:33,339
It's just that Friday's my day off,
I'm sort of tired...

579
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,967
If you want to get appointed,
pile up some extra hours.

580
00:45:37,311 --> 00:45:40,678
- Should I sign you?
- Yes, thanks.

581
00:45:44,785 --> 00:45:46,343
Can't hear a thing.

582
00:45:46,453 --> 00:45:48,717
I have two more waiting outside.

583
00:45:48,822 --> 00:45:50,346
Okay.

584
00:45:50,457 --> 00:45:52,425
His belly is fine.

585
00:45:52,526 --> 00:45:54,323
Go. I'll handle it.

586
00:45:54,428 --> 00:45:56,191
What happened to you?

587
00:45:57,264 --> 00:45:58,959
I don't know.

588
00:45:59,066 --> 00:46:00,363
I was in a fight.

589
00:46:00,467 --> 00:46:03,630
- Where did they hit you?
- Everywhere!

590
00:46:03,737 --> 00:46:07,468
- Did you lose consciousness?
- You're here, piece of shit?

591
00:46:07,574 --> 00:46:08,802
Cocksucker!

592
00:46:08,909 --> 00:46:11,605
- Let me go, bitch!
- Calm down.

593
00:46:11,712 --> 00:46:13,703
Stop it!

594
00:46:13,814 --> 00:46:15,839
Call security!

595
00:46:17,084 --> 00:46:18,346
Easy!

596
00:46:18,452 --> 00:46:20,010
Calm down!

597
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,849
Stop it, stop it!

598
00:46:21,955 --> 00:46:25,049
- Call security!
- They're coming!

599
00:46:25,158 --> 00:46:26,887
Calm down!

600
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:47,305
What was that?

601
00:46:47,414 --> 00:46:48,813
A gunshot!

602
00:46:50,918 --> 00:46:53,682
You, stay put!
Stay where you are!

603
00:46:57,691 --> 00:46:59,249
You okay?

604
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:04,588
Come here.

605
00:47:06,233 --> 00:47:08,064
Are you calm, now?

606
00:47:08,168 --> 00:47:09,692
Yes, I'm good.

607
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:14,840
Those guys are in for it.

608
00:47:14,942 --> 00:47:16,341
Crazy motherfuckers.

609
00:47:46,573 --> 00:47:49,371
Turn on the siren so we can move!

610
00:47:49,476 --> 00:47:52,445
It's a red light.
What can I do?

611
00:47:57,451 --> 00:47:59,146
Is that good?
Wanna try the other one?

612
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:02,711
Since he left the Foundation,
no news.

613
00:48:02,823 --> 00:48:04,688
He still owes me money.

614
00:48:04,791 --> 00:48:07,453
It's been a while since I saw him.

615
00:48:07,794 --> 00:48:10,354
I saw him at San Martin Hospital.

616
00:48:10,464 --> 00:48:13,160
Saw him in a hallway.

617
00:48:13,266 --> 00:48:15,734
Haven't you seen him around?

618
00:48:15,836 --> 00:48:17,861
- No.
- So, what's new?

619
00:48:17,971 --> 00:48:21,532
Nothing, the lawyer called asking

620
00:48:21,642 --> 00:48:24,270
if I'd heard about those five days
in Tablada.

621
00:48:24,378 --> 00:48:27,506
I told him I didn't have a clue.

622
00:48:27,614 --> 00:48:29,483
He said he'd go anyway.

623
00:48:53,674 --> 00:48:56,939
One for traumatology, a male.

624
00:48:58,211 --> 00:49:01,510
A woman for surgery.

625
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:10,556
A 25-year-old guy for isolation.

626
00:49:11,525 --> 00:49:13,720
No, we need to transfer that one.

627
00:49:13,827 --> 00:49:17,319
Here are the orders, thanks.

628
00:49:21,468 --> 00:49:22,958
What are you doing here?

629
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:24,537
- I've been calling you.
- I know.

630
00:49:24,638 --> 00:49:28,574
I left messages,
but you never answer.

631
00:49:28,942 --> 00:49:30,637
I need to talk to you.

632
00:49:30,744 --> 00:49:32,336
Okay, but not here.

633
00:49:32,446 --> 00:49:35,882
So tell me when and where.
I'll be there.

634
00:49:36,883 --> 00:49:40,819
I just need you to listen to me,
for just a minute.

635
00:49:41,922 --> 00:49:44,823
- Are you okay?
- Perfect. You?

636
00:49:45,325 --> 00:49:46,986
Fine.

637
00:49:47,094 --> 00:49:48,891
When?

638
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:52,198
I don't know, I'm working now.

639
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:34,836
What's with you, Sosa?

640
00:50:34,941 --> 00:50:37,409
Virgin Mary
turn you into a good boy?

641
00:50:37,511 --> 00:50:39,069
Did Jesus talk to you?

642
00:50:39,646 --> 00:50:41,477
That money is not yours.

643
00:50:41,581 --> 00:50:44,675
You'll have to break many bones
to it pay back.

644
00:50:44,785 --> 00:50:47,913
Meanwhile, they'll keep sending me
to beat your ass.

645
00:50:49,523 --> 00:50:51,013
What should I tell Casal?

646
00:50:51,124 --> 00:50:53,319
Tell me what to tell Casal.

647
00:50:53,426 --> 00:50:55,951
How long
have we known each other?

648
00:50:56,062 --> 00:50:58,929
You know
I'd rather be with Romina at home,

649
00:50:59,032 --> 00:51:01,023
or with the kids watching TV.

650
00:51:01,134 --> 00:51:06,333
But instead, I have to come
beat some sense into you.

651
00:51:07,774 --> 00:51:10,800
What should I tell Casal, Sosa?

652
00:51:10,911 --> 00:51:14,608
And this better be
crystal clear.

653
00:51:14,714 --> 00:51:18,707
You are the only responsible for this,
stupid son of a bitch.

654
00:51:35,168 --> 00:51:39,969
A guy with a head injury has been
asking for you for ten minutes.

655
00:51:41,641 --> 00:51:43,199
Thank you.

656
00:51:45,478 --> 00:51:47,275
Is this some kind of joke?

657
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:49,041
What happened?

658
00:51:49,149 --> 00:51:50,309
It's nothing.

659
00:51:50,417 --> 00:51:53,443
Look at you! Sit up.

660
00:51:53,553 --> 00:51:56,249
- Can you sit?
- Yes, of course.

661
00:51:57,891 --> 00:51:59,916
Come with me.

662
00:52:01,061 --> 00:52:02,858
- My jacket?
- I've got it.

663
00:52:04,698 --> 00:52:06,632
Hurry up.

664
00:52:08,869 --> 00:52:10,700
- Over there.
- Sorry.

665
00:52:12,505 --> 00:52:15,906
The Vega case was to be the last.
It was an easy one.

666
00:52:16,009 --> 00:52:18,170
I'd done it several times.

667
00:52:18,278 --> 00:52:21,076
Everyone got what they wanted.

668
00:52:21,748 --> 00:52:25,081
It was my last job
for the Foundation.

669
00:52:25,719 --> 00:52:26,686
Stay like this.

670
00:52:26,786 --> 00:52:30,688
I just needed my license back,
so I could be free.

671
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:33,554
But in the middle of all that mess...

672
00:52:34,794 --> 00:52:36,694
you turned up,

673
00:52:37,564 --> 00:52:42,433
and I started
to feel things could change.

674
00:52:44,271 --> 00:52:46,068
But of course...

675
00:52:47,707 --> 00:52:50,403
something had to go wrong.

676
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:51,772
Something...

677
00:52:53,513 --> 00:52:54,775
Stay put.

678
00:52:54,881 --> 00:52:57,008
It's so weird.

679
00:52:58,184 --> 00:53:01,244
Feels like getting out of jail.

680
00:53:02,656 --> 00:53:06,649
Even with my license back,
I can't work here.

681
00:53:07,193 --> 00:53:09,457
This was a warning.

682
00:53:11,464 --> 00:53:14,399
I'm starting to do things right.

683
00:53:14,501 --> 00:53:16,128
This is how you do it?

684
00:53:16,236 --> 00:53:21,731
I had them beat the hell out of me
to get your attention.

685
00:53:22,442 --> 00:53:26,242
I collected all the Vega money,
gave it to his wife.

686
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:29,842
She deserved it.

687
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:32,817
They can beat the hell out of me.

688
00:53:33,553 --> 00:53:37,045
I can't keep working here, Luján.

689
00:53:37,757 --> 00:53:41,386
Or you'll be stitching my face
every week.

690
00:53:43,396 --> 00:53:46,297
That's why I have to leave.

691
00:53:46,733 --> 00:53:49,065
I had two options:

692
00:53:49,169 --> 00:53:51,797
I could come say goodbye...

693
00:53:52,372 --> 00:53:55,500
or ask you to come with me.

694
00:53:58,511 --> 00:54:00,308
What do you think?

695
00:54:02,716 --> 00:54:05,446
That you're talking nonsense.

696
00:54:07,854 --> 00:54:10,721
- I'll be back.
- I mean it.

697
00:54:14,761 --> 00:54:18,993
- He was beat up.
- Beat up? How badly, when?

698
00:54:22,535 --> 00:54:25,436
Did he need stitches, and all?

699
00:54:26,106 --> 00:54:29,075
Yeah, gave him two.

700
00:54:29,509 --> 00:54:31,374
You would've given him 10!

701
00:54:31,478 --> 00:54:33,912
You fell for him at first sight!

702
00:54:34,014 --> 00:54:37,506
- Don't be a jerk, Pico.
- Look how you get...

703
00:54:37,617 --> 00:54:39,084
You're a jerk!

704
00:54:49,796 --> 00:54:52,196
What the fuck
happened to you, Sosa?

705
00:54:52,298 --> 00:54:53,890
Are you stupid?

706
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,935
I have enough problems
without your stupid ass.

707
00:54:57,037 --> 00:54:58,732
I just want to be left alone.

708
00:54:58,838 --> 00:55:01,068
I don't give a shit!

709
00:55:01,408 --> 00:55:03,876
You can't work this area.

710
00:55:03,977 --> 00:55:05,945
You fucked up the Vega case,

711
00:55:06,046 --> 00:55:08,514
you kept my money
and now you want more?

712
00:55:08,615 --> 00:55:11,516
Deduct it from all you owe me.
We'll be even.

713
00:55:11,618 --> 00:55:13,381
- Even?
- Even, yes.

714
00:55:13,486 --> 00:55:16,785
Sosa, you are in no position
to negotiate.

715
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:19,954
Know what?
Get lost. Disappear.

716
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:21,652
I don't want back in.

717
00:55:21,761 --> 00:55:24,628
I worked for you guys too long.
It's over.

718
00:55:24,731 --> 00:55:26,631
Let me work in peace.

719
00:55:26,733 --> 00:55:29,429
I'll get some money together
and leave.

720
00:55:29,536 --> 00:55:31,128
I understand.

721
00:55:31,237 --> 00:55:34,035
But those are my accidents,
my clients.

722
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:36,472
It's my clinic and my hospital.

723
00:55:36,576 --> 00:55:38,737
San Justo is mine,
this country is mine!

724
00:55:38,845 --> 00:55:42,042
So stay away
if you don't want any trouble.

725
00:55:42,148 --> 00:55:43,672
Otherwise,

726
00:55:44,884 --> 00:55:49,184
try doing homeowners' association,
divorce cases, estates...

727
00:55:49,923 --> 00:55:52,357
Francisco Abendaño...

728
00:55:52,459 --> 00:55:56,896
Bus crash.
The company paid 270 grand,

729
00:55:56,996 --> 00:55:58,861
he got 30,000.

730
00:55:58,965 --> 00:56:02,833
Delia Ortega, pregnant,
hit at a pedestrian crossing.

731
00:56:02,936 --> 00:56:04,233
I remember accurately.

732
00:56:04,337 --> 00:56:06,805
They paid 150, she got 25.

733
00:56:06,906 --> 00:56:11,434
Rodrigo Suárez. Bike accident.
They paid 80, he got 11.

734
00:56:11,544 --> 00:56:13,478
Martín Prieti and his family,
remember?

735
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:16,743
They paid 112 grand, he got 35.
Should I keep going?

736
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:18,579
Are you the voice
of conscience or something?

737
00:56:18,685 --> 00:56:21,483
No, I have their phone numbers,
you jerk.

738
00:56:22,722 --> 00:56:25,885
I have every copy
of the agreement forms.

739
00:56:25,992 --> 00:56:30,486
I can have them sue you,
one a week 'til I drive you crazy.

740
00:56:30,597 --> 00:56:33,930
Do you still think you're in charge?

741
00:56:34,033 --> 00:56:36,934
Who's going to protect you?
The Dog?

742
00:56:37,036 --> 00:56:39,266
Rinaldi? Who?

743
00:56:39,372 --> 00:56:43,069
Are you threatening me?

744
00:56:43,176 --> 00:56:46,737
Are you nuts?
After everything I've done for you?

745
00:56:46,846 --> 00:56:49,679
I got you back on your feet,
gave you a job.

746
00:56:49,782 --> 00:56:51,909
- That's really sentimental.
- Sure it is, asshole!

747
00:56:52,018 --> 00:56:53,315
Listen to me!

748
00:56:53,419 --> 00:56:57,879
Give me a little time to save up
and I'll leave for good.

749
00:56:57,991 --> 00:57:01,688
That's all I'm asking.
Don't you get it?

750
00:57:02,795 --> 00:57:05,059
I don't believe this!

751
00:57:12,539 --> 00:57:15,007
- Calm down, Sosa.
- You make me sick.

752
00:57:15,642 --> 00:57:17,405
- Don't do anything stupid.
- Fuck you!

753
00:57:17,977 --> 00:57:21,105
Did you treat Nevares?
The one with atrial fibrillation?

754
00:57:21,214 --> 00:57:22,272
Yes.

755
00:57:22,382 --> 00:57:24,714
- Did you give him heparin?
- Of course.

756
00:57:24,817 --> 00:57:26,418
Are you nuts?

757
00:57:26,586 --> 00:57:28,486
Do you want to kill him?

758
00:57:28,588 --> 00:57:31,955
Didn't you realize
he had a digestive hemorrhage?

759
00:57:32,458 --> 00:57:34,221
No, I didn't, Sorry.

760
00:57:34,327 --> 00:57:36,761
- What were you thinking?
- I need sleep.

761
00:57:36,863 --> 00:57:40,433
We're all tired!
You'll end up killing someone.

762
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,033
Go fix it.

763
00:57:42,135 --> 00:57:44,035
But I was on my way out...

764
00:57:44,137 --> 00:57:48,164
You'll stay until this is fixed.
Am I clear?

765
00:58:06,893 --> 00:58:09,761
Doctor, they're waiting upstairs.

766
00:58:31,584 --> 00:58:33,347
- C'mon, Luján.
- What happened?

767
00:58:33,453 --> 00:58:36,479
A car hit a truck on the highway.

768
00:58:36,589 --> 00:58:39,190
- How many victims?
- Six victims.

769
00:58:39,225 --> 00:58:40,556
Six?

770
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:42,821
Three in very serious condition.

771
00:58:42,929 --> 00:58:44,055
How many are we?

772
00:58:44,163 --> 00:58:46,256
It's Juárez, you and me.

773
00:58:46,366 --> 00:58:49,529
- What about Garrido?
- Garrido is doing triage.

774
00:58:49,636 --> 00:58:51,604
Doctor! Please help us!

775
00:58:51,871 --> 00:58:54,772
What happened, ma'am?
Easy, calm down...

776
00:58:54,874 --> 00:58:56,307
He's choking.

777
00:58:56,409 --> 00:58:59,606
Please wait here, calm down.

778
00:59:00,947 --> 00:59:03,677
- What's this?
- Respiratory arrest.

779
00:59:04,183 --> 00:59:05,241
Calm down.

780
00:59:05,351 --> 00:59:09,418
I can't work if you're screaming.
Wait outside!

781
00:59:12,125 --> 00:59:13,717
There he goes, c'mon.

782
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:17,088
Take off his shirt,
give him oxygen.

783
00:59:18,164 --> 00:59:19,961
Do we have a line?

784
00:59:20,466 --> 00:59:23,458
Stay calm, sir!
He's not getting any air.

785
00:59:23,569 --> 00:59:25,764
- Hypotonic pneumothorax?
- Yes.

786
00:59:26,372 --> 00:59:27,703
Put some Pervinox on.

787
00:59:27,807 --> 00:59:30,139
Try to breathe slowly!

788
00:59:30,243 --> 00:59:32,234
He's going into arrest!

789
00:59:32,345 --> 00:59:34,176
C'mon!

790
00:59:35,481 --> 00:59:37,608
He's breathing better.

791
00:59:38,484 --> 00:59:40,543
Can you hear me, man?

792
00:59:41,054 --> 00:59:42,749
Listen to his chest.

793
00:59:43,623 --> 00:59:46,888
- Breathe slowly.
- Take a deep breath.

794
00:59:46,993 --> 00:59:49,061
- Now we're talking!
- That's it!

795
00:59:49,162 --> 00:59:52,063
He's ventilating.
There you go.

796
00:59:52,165 --> 00:59:53,962
Go if you have to, I'll stay.

797
00:59:54,067 --> 00:59:55,625
Put the brace on and go.

798
00:59:57,136 --> 00:59:58,501
Call the surgeon.

799
00:59:58,604 --> 01:00:01,402
Let me put the brace on...

800
01:00:01,708 --> 01:00:04,676
- I'll stay with him.
- You're all set. Quiet.

801
01:00:04,777 --> 01:00:07,371
Breathe deeply, man, breathe.

802
01:00:21,728 --> 01:00:25,095
He was my only brother, doctor.

803
01:00:27,333 --> 01:00:31,531
Concentrate on your husband now.
He's fine.

804
01:00:33,873 --> 01:00:37,331
That's true.
Thank you, doctor.

805
01:00:42,315 --> 01:00:44,146
Everything's going to be okay.

806
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:46,081
How do I tell my mom?

807
01:00:46,185 --> 01:00:49,319
- You'll find the words.
- Oh, doctor!

808
01:00:49,422 --> 01:00:52,289
You'll find a way to tell her.

809
01:00:57,196 --> 01:01:00,233
It's all so awfull.

810
01:01:02,301 --> 01:01:04,531
Hold on there. Promise me.

811
01:01:04,637 --> 01:01:06,730
- What?
- That you'll do things right.

812
01:01:06,839 --> 01:01:09,672
- I've a ready told you.
- Promise me again.

813
01:01:13,446 --> 01:01:15,847
I promise you again.

814
01:01:16,482 --> 01:01:18,279
Okay?

815
01:01:22,688 --> 01:01:25,088
- Okay, let's go.
- Thanks.

816
01:01:26,192 --> 01:01:28,057
- I'm only doing it for her.
- Me too.

817
01:01:28,161 --> 01:01:30,361
I appreciate your trust, anyway.

818
01:01:31,531 --> 01:01:32,498
You're welcome.

819
01:01:43,176 --> 01:01:47,076
My family is already talking
to a different firm.

820
01:01:47,447 --> 01:01:50,780
They say it's better
if we all have the same lawyer.

821
01:01:50,883 --> 01:01:52,612
No, that's not the truth.

822
01:01:52,718 --> 01:01:55,653
You're free to choose
who you work with.

823
01:01:55,755 --> 01:01:57,790
And please,
don't sign any papers yet.

824
01:01:57,990 --> 01:01:59,582
Bring me the papers,

825
01:01:59,692 --> 01:02:02,456
and I'll explain
what their proposition is.

826
01:02:02,562 --> 01:02:04,427
Okay, counselor.

827
01:02:04,931 --> 01:02:08,162
What can we do about my brother?

828
01:02:08,267 --> 01:02:10,132
My sister-in-law is in despair.

829
01:02:10,236 --> 01:02:14,604
The hospital and police station
won't tell us anything.

830
01:02:16,175 --> 01:02:19,906
They won't let us take his body.

831
01:03:22,308 --> 01:03:26,875
Get those X-rays to me.
I'm on call all night, okay?

832
01:03:28,147 --> 01:03:30,911
Olivera?
Come here for a second.

833
01:03:31,017 --> 01:03:32,882
Sure, what's going on?

834
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:36,554
Have you gone mad?

835
01:03:36,889 --> 01:03:39,690
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean?

836
01:03:39,792 --> 01:03:42,920
Don't play naive.
Don't play dumb with me!

837
01:03:43,029 --> 01:03:46,988
Are you helping that vulture
who's been lurking around here?

838
01:03:48,167 --> 01:03:49,327
No.

839
01:03:49,435 --> 01:03:51,904
Don't mess with me.

840
01:03:52,204 --> 01:03:54,035
And watch what you do.

841
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:57,735
This could turn ugly.
You could regret it.

842
01:03:57,843 --> 01:04:00,311
Look at me
when I'm talking to you!

843
01:04:00,413 --> 01:04:01,812
I think you're confused...

844
01:04:01,914 --> 01:04:04,747
You're the one who's confused!

845
01:04:05,851 --> 01:04:08,919
Consider yourself warned.
Don't forget that.

846
01:06:15,748 --> 01:06:17,306
Hi.

847
01:06:18,451 --> 01:06:20,442
Good morning!

848
01:06:23,389 --> 01:06:25,755
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

849
01:06:35,601 --> 01:06:37,466
What do you need?

850
01:06:37,803 --> 01:06:40,738
- Are my things at the hospital?
- No.

851
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:42,899
Everything's in your purse.

852
01:06:43,008 --> 01:06:46,676
- Do you want them?
- No, it's okay.

853
01:06:47,813 --> 01:06:51,772
- You can leave if you want.
- Do you want me to?

854
01:06:54,687 --> 01:06:57,247
I want you to stay.

855
01:06:58,691 --> 01:07:00,750
Then I'll stay.

856
01:07:03,129 --> 01:07:05,461
Thanks for picking me up.

857
01:07:24,316 --> 01:07:26,619
- He came by.
- Who?

858
01:07:26,719 --> 01:07:28,152
The fat man.

859
01:07:28,254 --> 01:07:31,655
- And?
- Asked me if I'd seen you around.

860
01:07:32,091 --> 01:07:33,991
- Got the papers?
- Yes.

861
01:07:34,827 --> 01:07:36,818
Here. Count it.

862
01:07:38,130 --> 01:07:39,961
What are you up to?

863
01:07:44,236 --> 01:07:45,897
Lay low for a while.

864
01:08:09,395 --> 01:08:12,362
- Te Ibáñez Sosa is here.
- I'll tell him.

865
01:08:12,464 --> 01:08:14,932
- Anything to drink?
- A glass of water.

866
01:08:34,453 --> 01:08:37,889
Think I don't know
you and Casal are plotting?

867
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:39,790
I've had it!

868
01:08:43,796 --> 01:08:46,287
- Goodbye, Sosa.
- Rinaldi.

869
01:08:47,166 --> 01:08:49,430
Sosa, sorry I kept you waiting.

870
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:51,332
Don't worry, no problem.

871
01:08:51,904 --> 01:08:54,405
You like to surprise me.

872
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:59,241
You fleed the Foundation
without saying goodbye.

873
01:08:59,345 --> 01:09:02,644
Slamming the door on your way out.
That shows lack of gratitude.

874
01:09:02,748 --> 01:09:05,308
Oh yes, that's what it is.

875
01:09:06,151 --> 01:09:07,919
Then you come here
without warning.

876
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:11,217
- I warned...
- Who did you warn? Nobody!

877
01:09:11,523 --> 01:09:15,254
You're taking care
of the Route 3 accident, right?

878
01:09:17,129 --> 01:09:19,495
- Have their power of attorney?
- Two...

879
01:09:19,598 --> 01:09:22,233
Casal has the other three.

880
01:09:22,301 --> 01:09:24,531
So what are you doing here?

881
01:09:26,805 --> 01:09:28,830
I want to work in peace.

882
01:09:28,941 --> 01:09:32,638
Casal is very anxious,
he's all over me.

883
01:09:33,145 --> 01:09:35,947
- I need you to keep him on a leash.
- Yes...

884
01:09:36,081 --> 01:09:38,242
Casal wants to fuck me over.

885
01:09:38,350 --> 01:09:41,444
He's plotting with Rinaldi.

886
01:09:41,553 --> 01:09:43,521
It's always been this way.

887
01:09:43,622 --> 01:09:46,489
Those below
want a piece of those on top.

888
01:09:46,592 --> 01:09:49,618
- I don't want a piece of anyone.
- I do!

889
01:09:49,728 --> 01:09:52,362
I want those
five powers of attorney here.

890
01:09:52,464 --> 01:09:54,728
And I want you bringing them,
not Casal.

891
01:09:54,833 --> 01:09:58,462
We give each other a mutual hand.
That's the way its done.

892
01:09:59,305 --> 01:10:02,968
What do you need
to get those papers?

893
01:10:04,944 --> 01:10:06,673
Time.

894
01:10:06,779 --> 01:10:08,713
You'll get it.

895
01:10:08,814 --> 01:10:11,806
I'll make sure Casal
gets off your back.

896
01:10:11,917 --> 01:10:15,182
Bring me back those papers signed.

897
01:10:15,287 --> 01:10:19,781
And if all this goes well,
I have big plans for you.

898
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:30,125
Counselor,
we intend to negotiate,

899
01:10:30,235 --> 01:10:33,068
but this situation
is getting complicated.

900
01:10:33,172 --> 01:10:36,972
You handle some cases,
Mr. Casal handles others.

901
01:10:37,076 --> 01:10:41,342
It would be much simple for us
to negotiate with one firm.

902
01:10:41,447 --> 01:10:44,007
- Am I clear?
- Yes, perfectly.

903
01:10:44,350 --> 01:10:48,684
We can finish this conversation
in court if you wish.

904
01:10:49,254 --> 01:10:51,449
Mr. Casal
called me five times today.

905
01:10:51,557 --> 01:10:55,687
He told me your powers of attorney
had been revoked.

906
01:10:56,028 --> 01:10:58,189
Do you believe Casal?

907
01:10:58,297 --> 01:10:59,855
Casal?

908
01:11:00,733 --> 01:11:02,724
This invitation is for you.

909
01:11:02,835 --> 01:11:05,565
It's for my daughter's sweet 15.

910
01:11:05,671 --> 01:11:08,333
Thank you very much!

911
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:09,964
You are coming, right?

912
01:11:10,409 --> 01:11:12,468
- When is it?
- Next Saturday.

913
01:11:12,578 --> 01:11:15,138
The thing is, I work on Saturday.

914
01:11:15,247 --> 01:11:16,908
I'm on call, I can't go.

915
01:11:17,016 --> 01:11:20,452
Just drop by, please.

916
01:11:20,986 --> 01:11:26,219
Thanks to you, my husband is alive,
and we can have this party.

917
01:11:26,325 --> 01:11:29,886
We'd love for you to come.
You are our special guest.

918
01:11:29,995 --> 01:11:33,795
Picture time, everyone!

919
01:11:36,535 --> 01:11:38,127
Ready?

920
01:11:38,871 --> 01:11:40,862
Say cheese!

921
01:11:42,141 --> 01:11:44,701
Perfect! One more.

922
01:11:45,411 --> 01:11:47,174
Say cheese...

923
01:11:48,113 --> 01:11:50,980
One more time.

924
01:11:51,083 --> 01:11:52,983
Smile, Grandma!

925
01:11:53,752 --> 01:11:57,017
Faced with such an offer,
he obviously signed.

926
01:11:57,122 --> 01:12:00,387
The same thing's happening
with your case, they bought it off.

927
01:12:00,492 --> 01:12:03,484
One year later,
you'll find out that the lawsuit

928
01:12:03,595 --> 01:12:06,359
brought in 80, 100 or 120 grand.

929
01:12:06,465 --> 01:12:08,365
And you'll feel ripped off.

930
01:12:08,467 --> 01:12:11,903
You'll want to sue, but, too late.
You've a ready signed.

931
01:12:12,004 --> 01:12:15,872
Thing is, they have a lot of money,
a lot of cases...

932
01:12:15,974 --> 01:12:18,534
Like yours, and they have time.

933
01:12:18,644 --> 01:12:20,339
They can wait.

934
01:12:20,446 --> 01:12:24,246
Right, but when would we
get the money with you?

935
01:12:24,349 --> 01:12:25,941
That's not my decision.

936
01:12:26,051 --> 01:12:30,488
It's something we need to discuss,
like we did with them.

937
01:12:30,589 --> 01:12:32,284
Just don't be in a rush,

938
01:12:32,391 --> 01:12:33,824
that's when you lose.

939
01:12:33,926 --> 01:12:37,589
The key
is knowing how to be patient.

940
01:13:11,163 --> 01:13:13,563
Hurrah for Dr. Olivera!

941
01:13:19,938 --> 01:13:21,906
Let's go to the center.

942
01:15:47,919 --> 01:15:49,750
I love you.

943
01:15:54,559 --> 01:15:58,928
When I came to Buenos Aires
I met an anesthetist.

944
01:15:59,031 --> 01:16:01,864
With him, I started shooting up.

945
01:16:03,769 --> 01:16:06,533
It's the only thing that soothes me.

946
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:11,141
And I think I like it, too.

947
01:16:17,082 --> 01:16:18,982
Do you have any pictures?

948
01:16:19,685 --> 01:16:22,552
- What kind?
- Of when you were fat.

949
01:16:22,654 --> 01:16:24,417
I'm not ever showing you those.

950
01:16:24,523 --> 01:16:26,252
What a pity.

951
01:16:26,358 --> 01:16:29,987
I could fall
for a fat version of yourself.

952
01:16:30,095 --> 01:16:32,120
Don't you like me thin?

953
01:16:32,230 --> 01:16:34,630
More or less...

954
01:16:36,935 --> 01:16:38,630
You're mean...

955
01:16:48,013 --> 01:16:50,538
- Tell me something about you.
- About me?

956
01:16:50,649 --> 01:16:52,583
- No...
- Why?

957
01:16:52,684 --> 01:16:55,312
Because we're having a good time.

958
01:16:56,621 --> 01:16:59,021
I'd rather not ruin it.

959
01:17:18,477 --> 01:17:19,774
"At San Justo,

960
01:17:19,878 --> 01:17:22,847
La Matanza County,
state of Buenos Aires,

961
01:17:22,948 --> 01:17:27,510
they stand to bestow
legal power of attorney

962
01:17:27,619 --> 01:17:30,645
in favor of
Counselor Héctor Sosa,

963
01:17:30,756 --> 01:17:35,784
so he can be part
of all judicial matters,

964
01:17:35,894 --> 01:17:37,691
and therefore entitled

965
01:17:37,796 --> 01:17:40,356
to collect cash

966
01:17:40,465 --> 01:17:43,195
or negotiate on any business matter."

967
01:17:43,301 --> 01:17:45,599
This means you're authorizing me

968
01:17:45,704 --> 01:17:49,435
to collect any money
the insurance company pays you.

969
01:17:50,142 --> 01:17:52,508
My turn to sign.

970
01:18:01,820 --> 01:18:04,311
You wanted me to dance
to make fun of me!

971
01:18:04,423 --> 01:18:06,755
- Not at all!
- I knew it.

972
01:18:10,595 --> 01:18:12,358
See? I was right.

973
01:18:12,664 --> 01:18:14,689
Look at your shoulders.

974
01:18:25,744 --> 01:18:28,110
I can't believe I'm here again.

975
01:18:28,213 --> 01:18:30,579
Want me to pick you up tonight?

976
01:18:30,682 --> 01:18:32,877
I'm on call 'till tomorrow.

977
01:18:33,485 --> 01:18:36,147
- What then?
- I'll call you.

978
01:18:38,590 --> 01:18:42,583
Can you take him to triage
and put a line in? Thanks.

979
01:18:43,862 --> 01:18:46,524
The one on 12
needs his drip changed, okay?

980
01:18:46,631 --> 01:18:50,260
I'm here for a blood test.
Here's the prescription.

981
01:18:50,368 --> 01:18:53,201
Not here.
Try the other counter.

982
01:19:12,757 --> 01:19:14,622
Hello?

983
01:19:26,838 --> 01:19:29,466
Hello?
I'm locked in!

984
01:19:29,574 --> 01:19:31,940
We can't open, doctorl

985
01:19:32,377 --> 01:19:35,039
Here's something to read!

986
01:19:35,146 --> 01:19:37,205
So you don't get bored!

987
01:19:48,994 --> 01:19:51,189
Open up!

988
01:19:51,296 --> 01:19:52,820
- What's your problem?
- Let me out.

989
01:19:52,931 --> 01:19:55,058
- Walk, please.
- Let me go.

990
01:19:55,166 --> 01:19:56,861
Take it easy.

991
01:19:57,269 --> 01:19:59,499
Don't complicate things.

992
01:19:59,604 --> 01:20:03,301
Stay calm and you'll be fine.
Anyone else here?

993
01:20:03,408 --> 01:20:04,773
No.

994
01:20:05,176 --> 01:20:07,406
Do you know why we're here?

995
01:20:10,081 --> 01:20:12,845
Are you stupid,
didn't you read the case file?

996
01:20:12,951 --> 01:20:14,942
Wait for me outside.

997
01:20:17,722 --> 01:20:20,623
How did someone like
you get mixed up in this?

998
01:20:21,293 --> 01:20:23,887
You do know why we're here, right?

999
01:20:24,262 --> 01:20:26,355
We sent you signs.

1000
01:20:26,464 --> 01:20:28,557
Do you still not get it?

1001
01:20:28,934 --> 01:20:30,265
Let me out.

1002
01:20:32,571 --> 01:20:34,562
You're hurting me!

1003
01:20:34,673 --> 01:20:37,733
Where do you think you're going?
This isn't over.

1004
01:20:37,842 --> 01:20:40,174
I'll say when it's over!

1005
01:20:41,646 --> 01:20:43,409
Are you done?

1006
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:50,388
Stop it!

1007
01:21:14,045 --> 01:21:15,342
What happened? What is it?

1008
01:21:15,447 --> 01:21:18,314
What did they do?
Let me take a look.

1009
01:21:18,416 --> 01:21:20,816
Luján, look at me.

1010
01:21:21,786 --> 01:21:24,653
- Son of a bitch!
- Drive me away from here, please.

1011
01:21:24,756 --> 01:21:26,951
Are you okay?

1012
01:21:27,258 --> 01:21:29,226
Tell me, sweetie.

1013
01:21:33,999 --> 01:21:35,762
Forgive me, please.

1014
01:21:35,867 --> 01:21:37,858
Luján, please forgive me.

1015
01:21:44,609 --> 01:21:46,600
Sit down, hang in there.

1016
01:21:46,711 --> 01:21:48,542
There, let me see,

1017
01:21:50,181 --> 01:21:52,308
Open your mouth.

1018
01:21:53,918 --> 01:21:55,818
Son of a bitch...

1019
01:21:56,521 --> 01:21:59,456
Let me get this off.
Raise your arms.

1020
01:22:01,459 --> 01:22:03,222
- What?
- It hurts...

1021
01:22:03,328 --> 01:22:05,956
- What hurts?
- Everything.

1022
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:23,705
Wait.

1023
01:22:26,251 --> 01:22:27,548
What is it?

1024
01:22:29,521 --> 01:22:31,284
Help me.

1025
01:22:32,090 --> 01:22:33,751
Please...

1026
01:23:03,521 --> 01:23:05,045
Here.

1027
01:23:05,557 --> 01:23:07,650
Stick it in the vein.

1028
01:23:07,759 --> 01:23:10,387
I know how to do it.
Don't worry.

1029
01:23:31,516 --> 01:23:32,915
Look at me.

1030
01:23:33,017 --> 01:23:34,814
Thanks.

1031
01:23:43,428 --> 01:23:46,158
Please, forgive me.

1032
01:23:48,867 --> 01:23:51,097
I'm going to be okay.

1033
01:24:05,550 --> 01:24:07,142
I love you.

1034
01:24:29,307 --> 01:24:30,968
Son of a bitch!

1035
01:24:31,376 --> 01:24:34,573
Don't ever mess with her again!

1036
01:24:36,548 --> 01:24:39,039
You motherfucking shit!

1037
01:24:39,751 --> 01:24:42,083
Not ever again!
Got it?

1038
01:24:42,187 --> 01:24:44,018
Never again!

1039
01:24:59,904 --> 01:25:01,769
Understood?

1040
01:25:02,307 --> 01:25:04,241
Did you hear what I said?

1041
01:25:07,178 --> 01:25:08,873
Answer me!

1042
01:25:10,014 --> 01:25:12,676
Fucking son of a bitch!

1043
01:25:45,950 --> 01:25:47,474
What happened?

1044
01:26:32,897 --> 01:26:34,797
Luján, we're leaving!

1045
01:26:35,366 --> 01:26:37,527
Wake up, c'mon.

1046
01:26:38,303 --> 01:26:40,328
Please, Luján, wake up!

1047
01:26:40,438 --> 01:26:42,804
Listen to me, there's no time.

1048
01:26:42,907 --> 01:26:44,431
We need to go.

1049
01:26:44,542 --> 01:26:46,510
- Your face...
- Pack some clothes.

1050
01:26:46,611 --> 01:26:48,545
I'll tell you later.

1051
01:26:48,913 --> 01:26:50,039
Here's a bag.

1052
01:27:10,301 --> 01:27:11,768
C'mon.

1053
01:27:30,388 --> 01:27:32,481
Hold on, don't open.

1054
01:27:32,590 --> 01:27:36,526
Don't look out, look at me.

1055
01:27:36,627 --> 01:27:39,255
- We'll find another way.
- Let's go back up.

1056
01:27:39,364 --> 01:27:40,626
You go back up.

1057
01:27:40,732 --> 01:27:43,633
You lock yourself in
until I'm back.

1058
01:27:43,735 --> 01:27:46,465
Don't answer the phone.
Listen to me.

1059
01:27:46,571 --> 01:27:48,038
Please, don't go...

1060
01:27:48,139 --> 01:27:51,540
Luján, listen to me!

1061
01:27:51,642 --> 01:27:54,873
There's no time to waste.

1062
01:27:54,979 --> 01:27:59,313
Listen to me! Look at me.

1063
01:27:59,417 --> 01:28:00,907
Open your eyes!

1064
01:28:01,019 --> 01:28:03,249
Look at me.

1065
01:28:03,554 --> 01:28:05,146
Grab the bag and go upstairs.

1066
01:28:05,256 --> 01:28:08,521
Lock the door
and don't open it until I'm back.

1067
01:28:08,626 --> 01:28:11,459
Don't answer the phone.
It'll be fine.

1068
01:28:11,562 --> 01:28:13,860
I'll come back.

1069
01:28:13,965 --> 01:28:15,694
I promise I'll come back.

1070
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:18,200
- Please...
- Stay calm, go upstairs.

1071
01:28:18,302 --> 01:28:20,202
I'll come back, sweetie.

1072
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:37,278
Take a look.

1073
01:28:37,722 --> 01:28:39,451
Look at what you did.

1074
01:28:39,557 --> 01:28:42,424
Fuck, man. Look at him.

1075
01:28:43,161 --> 01:28:45,061
You went too far.

1076
01:28:45,163 --> 01:28:47,063
Poor thing!

1077
01:28:48,499 --> 01:28:51,263
Casal had it coming.

1078
01:28:51,636 --> 01:28:54,127
Finally got what he deserved.

1079
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:57,067
What's done, is done.

1080
01:28:57,175 --> 01:28:59,405
Truth is you did me a favor.

1081
01:28:59,510 --> 01:29:02,274
But I don't want you
getting in trouble with them.

1082
01:29:02,380 --> 01:29:06,407
- What do you want?
- For you to keep your calm.

1083
01:29:07,051 --> 01:29:08,678
Uncuff him...

1084
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:11,445
Let's have a chat.

1085
01:29:13,057 --> 01:29:14,991
Sit down, okay?

1086
01:29:25,403 --> 01:29:28,861
You got all the cases
and you kept it to yourself.

1087
01:29:31,042 --> 01:29:33,442
It's OK, though,
once you collect,

1088
01:29:33,811 --> 01:29:36,439
you'll cash the checks
and bring me the money.

1089
01:29:36,547 --> 01:29:38,276
How much?

1090
01:29:38,382 --> 01:29:40,543
All of it, of course.

1091
01:29:40,651 --> 01:29:44,314
- Think of it as an investment.
- That money is not mine.

1092
01:29:44,422 --> 01:29:47,619
I can't solve all your problems.

1093
01:29:47,725 --> 01:29:52,389
I'm offering my friendship
and protection. Is that not enough?

1094
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:56,728
Muñoz!

1095
01:29:57,768 --> 01:29:59,497
Muñoz!

1096
01:30:01,606 --> 01:30:03,301
Here I am.

1097
01:30:04,709 --> 01:30:08,509
He has to take care
of a very delicate errand for me.

1098
01:30:08,613 --> 01:30:11,343
I want you to go with him
and stay close,

1099
01:30:11,449 --> 01:30:13,917
for his own safety.

1100
01:30:14,018 --> 01:30:16,816
- Come on.
- Go in peace.

1101
01:30:20,625 --> 01:30:23,685
Hey, Sosa...
Sosa!

1102
01:30:24,362 --> 01:30:26,762
This chair is yours.

1103
01:31:21,285 --> 01:31:23,310
Listen carefully.

1104
01:31:23,688 --> 01:31:27,283
Villegas 1357,
opposite the waste ground.

1105
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:32,618
Think they'll let you off
the hook once you collect?

1106
01:31:32,730 --> 01:31:35,324
No. So, pay attention.

1107
01:31:35,433 --> 01:31:37,628
This is madness.

1108
01:31:40,871 --> 01:31:43,704
Just stay with me, please.

1109
01:31:56,420 --> 01:31:58,081
We can do this.

1110
01:32:08,532 --> 01:32:10,557
Be careful.

1111
01:32:19,176 --> 01:32:21,144
I'm scared.

1112
01:32:22,546 --> 01:32:25,481
Don't be.
Trust me.

1113
01:32:27,218 --> 01:32:29,345
Where's the bank?

1114
01:32:30,388 --> 01:32:33,915
- Villegas 1357.
- Good.

1115
01:33:18,502 --> 01:33:20,970
"The damages
in favor of the plaintiff

1116
01:33:21,072 --> 01:33:23,700
amount to $580,000,

1117
01:33:23,808 --> 01:33:26,174
payable in three checks,

1118
01:33:26,277 --> 01:33:28,837
made out
to the plaintiff's attorney."

1119
01:33:28,946 --> 01:33:32,973
The rest states the parties involved.
And your signature.

1120
01:33:54,538 --> 01:33:55,766
Good.

1121
01:33:57,007 --> 01:33:59,202
Sosa, you're finally here.

1122
01:33:59,310 --> 01:34:00,902
You have everything?

1123
01:34:02,046 --> 01:34:03,809
Let's check it out.

1124
01:34:05,683 --> 01:34:07,844
Looks like it's all there.
Let's go.

1125
01:35:05,810 --> 01:35:07,744
That's all of it.

1126
01:35:11,982 --> 01:35:13,347
All right.

1127
01:35:40,244 --> 01:35:42,212
530,000.

1128
01:35:42,313 --> 01:35:45,714
And 560,000.
20,000 is our commission.

1129
01:35:55,025 --> 01:35:58,722
The office is in an awful state.

1130
01:35:58,829 --> 01:36:01,297
I had it cleaned thoroughly.

1131
01:36:01,398 --> 01:36:03,798
I'll have the furniture replaced,

1132
01:36:03,901 --> 01:36:05,892
then send in the painting crew.

1133
01:36:06,003 --> 01:36:07,994
What color would you like?

1134
01:36:08,105 --> 01:36:11,040
I mean what color for the office?

1135
01:36:11,141 --> 01:36:13,109
I don't know.

1136
01:36:13,511 --> 01:36:15,502
I think a lighter color

1137
01:36:15,613 --> 01:36:18,514
would make it look bigger,
more important.

1138
01:36:18,616 --> 01:36:21,585
It was too dark, too cluttered.

1139
01:36:22,152 --> 01:36:24,848
We'll see about that later.

1140
01:36:31,462 --> 01:36:33,225
Okay, this is it.

1141
01:36:33,564 --> 01:36:34,826
Here.

1142
01:36:34,932 --> 01:36:36,900
You're coming with us, Sosa.

1143
01:36:37,001 --> 01:36:40,095
- Where to?
- Wherever, we can give you a ride.

1144
01:36:44,608 --> 01:36:46,132
Get in.

1145
01:36:58,923 --> 01:37:02,723
Keep thinking about the color
and let me know.

1146
01:37:03,227 --> 01:37:05,559
I had the locks changed.

1147
01:37:05,930 --> 01:37:10,560
I'll have the keys later today.
Remind me to give you a set.

1148
01:37:12,136 --> 01:37:15,867
I already got the list
of this weekend's accidents.

1149
01:37:16,206 --> 01:37:19,972
Last night, a taxi ran over
two guys at Juan Terán.

1150
01:37:20,077 --> 01:37:21,874
A big fucking mess!

1151
01:37:24,048 --> 01:37:27,142
Did you read the paper?
How many this week?

1152
01:37:27,918 --> 01:37:29,613
Eight already?

1153
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:33,247
That's over 30 this month.
Unbelievable.

1154
01:37:41,298 --> 01:37:43,732
Did you hear
about the highway crash?

1155
01:37:43,834 --> 01:37:45,631
The bus was packed.

1156
01:37:45,736 --> 01:37:48,762
There's over a dozen injured,
a couple dead...

1157
01:37:57,815 --> 01:38:00,045
Sons of bitches
should fix the gate.

1158
01:38:00,150 --> 01:38:01,378
They're useless...

1159
01:38:01,485 --> 01:38:05,285
This one guy ended up
with 60% disability.

1160
01:38:05,389 --> 01:38:07,755
We need to get our hands on him.

1161
01:38:07,858 --> 01:38:10,258
That's your job, Sosa.

1162
01:38:11,929 --> 01:38:15,865
What's the matter with him?
Cat got his tongue?

1163
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:18,099
You're fucked, Dog!

1164
01:38:21,772 --> 01:38:24,366
- Go! Didn't you hear?
- Wait for Vitali.

1165
01:38:24,475 --> 01:38:27,035
- No! Let's go!
- We're waiting for him!

1166
01:38:28,445 --> 01:38:30,140
What happened?

1167
01:38:30,514 --> 01:38:32,709
Please, at least
to the corner so we can see.

1168
01:38:32,816 --> 01:38:34,340
Here he comes.

1169
01:38:35,085 --> 01:38:37,019
Look at the truck...

1170
01:38:39,657 --> 01:38:41,557
What happened?

1171
01:38:41,659 --> 01:38:44,389
- Hurry up!
- Hurry up! What happened?

1172
01:38:44,495 --> 01:38:46,156
I don't know.

1173
01:38:49,900 --> 01:38:52,266
It looks bad! Do you see him?

1174
01:38:52,369 --> 01:38:54,234
No, not yet.

1175
01:39:03,714 --> 01:39:06,808
Sosa, are you okay?

1176
01:39:14,358 --> 01:39:15,825
Are you okay?

1177
01:39:15,926 --> 01:39:18,019
Are you okay?
Can you hear me?

1178
01:39:18,128 --> 01:39:21,859
Stay put, don't move.

1179
01:39:21,965 --> 01:39:24,525
Don't move him!
Put a brace on him!

1180
01:39:24,635 --> 01:39:26,694
We need to get him out!

1181
01:39:26,804 --> 01:39:27,998
- Are you okay?
- It's my leg...

1182
01:39:28,105 --> 01:39:29,333
Can you hear me?

1183
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:31,465
- Yes, I'm fine.
- Don't move, stay put.

1184
01:39:31,575 --> 01:39:33,805
Hold on, hold on!

1185
01:39:34,578 --> 01:39:36,307
Here's the brace.

1186
01:39:36,413 --> 01:39:39,177
No time for that,
Help me get him out.

1187
01:39:39,516 --> 01:39:40,813
How do you feel?

1188
01:39:40,918 --> 01:39:44,149
Don't close your eyes.
Look at me, honey.

1189
01:39:44,254 --> 01:39:45,846
Look at me.

1190
01:39:45,956 --> 01:39:47,446
Look at me.

1191
01:39:47,558 --> 01:39:49,287
I'm okay.

1192
01:39:51,695 --> 01:39:53,526
The money. Get the suitcase.

1193
01:39:53,630 --> 01:39:55,393
The suitcase.

1194
01:39:55,833 --> 01:39:57,494
He was coming too fast.

1195
01:39:57,601 --> 01:40:00,627
- Very fast.
- He hit you hard...

1196
01:40:01,105 --> 01:40:03,801
Bring the briefcase.

1197
01:40:05,375 --> 01:40:08,606
Don't get worked up, stay calm.

1198
01:40:10,714 --> 01:40:11,681
Sit down.

1199
01:40:11,782 --> 01:40:13,750
- Let me examine him.
- Let's split.

1200
01:40:13,851 --> 01:40:16,012
Let me examine him, Pico.

1201
01:40:22,793 --> 01:40:26,024
Where is the gun?
Give it to me!

1202
01:40:29,032 --> 01:40:32,593
- Don't go there!
- Are you okay? Pico!

1203
01:40:36,039 --> 01:40:38,200
He's dead!

1204
01:40:39,777 --> 01:40:41,972
- Where's the car?
- Over there!

1205
01:40:46,116 --> 01:40:47,378
Come on!

1206
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:51,478
Are you okay?

1207
01:40:51,588 --> 01:40:53,453
Get in the car!

1208
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:59,793
- Hit it!
- It won't start!

1209
01:41:06,370 --> 01:41:08,270
Keep going!

1210
01:41:14,077 --> 01:41:16,637
Are you okay?

1211
01:41:17,915 --> 01:41:20,975
Look at me. Open your eyes.

1212
01:41:25,055 --> 01:41:28,115
- Tell me what to do.
- Are we being followed?

1213
01:41:30,360 --> 01:41:32,123
No one's following us.

1214
01:41:32,229 --> 01:41:35,665
Look at me. Are you okay?

1215
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,592
Make a right.

1216
01:41:48,645 --> 01:41:50,203
You did well.

1217
01:41:50,314 --> 01:41:53,709
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

1218
01:41:53,750 --> 01:41:55,980
Look at me.

1219
01:41:56,286 --> 01:41:57,583
Are you okay?

1220
01:41:57,688 --> 01:42:00,122
- Thanks, Doctor.
- I love you.

1221
01:42:00,224 --> 01:42:02,055
Me too. Let's get out of here.

1222
01:42:02,159 --> 01:42:03,649
Yeah, let's go.

1223
01:42:17,441 --> 01:42:20,137
Coming through, please!

1224
01:42:21,178 --> 01:42:25,581
A female over here
and inside the car, a male.

1225
01:42:25,682 --> 01:42:27,616
The guy is covered in blood.

1226
01:42:27,718 --> 01:42:31,154
No pulse, blood in the abdomen
and mid-section.

1227
01:42:31,255 --> 01:42:32,882
We're taking the woman.

1228
01:42:32,990 --> 01:42:34,958
Ma'am?

1229
01:42:36,193 --> 01:42:38,457
Can you tell me about the accident?

1230
01:42:38,562 --> 01:42:41,622
Take the neck brace.
Let me help you.

1231
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:44,923
Lift on my count of three, okay?

1232
01:42:45,035 --> 01:42:47,003
One, two, three...

1233
01:42:48,205 --> 01:42:51,140
