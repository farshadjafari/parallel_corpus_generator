<i>Please note, the Kansas Clean Air Act has

5
00:01:24,355 --> 00:01:26,152

00:01:57,956 --> 00:02:00,150
<i>Thank you for your cooperation.</i>

12
00:02:26,992 --> 00:02:28,221
-Excuse me.
-Sorry.

13
00:02:28,328 --> 00:02:31,024
So, l'm gonna make it
onto the earlier flight, right?

14
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:32,324
Are you gonna check that?

15
00:02:32,432 --> 00:02:34,365
No, l'm gonna carry it on.
lt's got valuables in it.

16
00:02:34,466 --> 00:02:35,433
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

17
00:02:57,223 --> 00:02:58,747
-God, excuse me.
-No, l'm sorry.

18
00:03:00,893 --> 00:03:02,086
That bag is wicked heavy, anyhow.

19
00:03:02,194 --> 00:03:04,686
l was looking at my phone.
l hate it when people do that.

20
00:03:08,935 --> 00:03:10,731
You have a little

21
00:03:12,104 --> 00:03:13,538
smudge.

22
00:03:26,451 --> 00:03:27,475
What are these?

23
00:03:27,586 --> 00:03:31,216
Those are two barrel carburetors
for a Pontiac Tri-Power.

24
00:03:36,496 --> 00:03:39,293
Those are exhaust tips for a '74 Z-28.

25
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:43,331
l restore old cars, so.. .

26
00:03:46,104 --> 00:03:47,867
Hair-dryer.

27
00:03:57,483 --> 00:03:59,040
Oh, my God, l'm so sorry.

28
00:04:01,854 --> 00:04:04,186
-This is getting to be a habit.
-Yeah, it is.

29
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:08,086
Sorry about that.

30
00:04:08,828 --> 00:04:10,318
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

31
00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:13,563
-Thank you.
-Yeah, sure.

32
00:04:13,665 --> 00:04:16,065
-Boston?
-Yeah.

33
00:04:16,869 --> 00:04:17,927
Gate 12.

34
00:04:20,038 --> 00:04:21,528
-Enjoy your flight, Mr. Garcia.
-Thank you.

35
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:22,629
Hi.

36
00:04:24,143 --> 00:04:25,701
l'm sorry. You're not on this flight.

37
00:04:26,646 --> 00:04:28,704
Well, l just checked in
for this one, like, 10 minutes ago.

38
00:04:28,814 --> 00:04:30,281
That must be some sort of mistake.

39
00:04:30,382 --> 00:04:32,509
l'm sorry,
the computer shows that we're booked.

40
00:04:32,617 --> 00:04:34,449
Listen, Sharry.

41
00:04:34,553 --> 00:04:37,420
Tomorrow my little sister's
getting married. l practically raised her.

42
00:04:37,523 --> 00:04:39,514
l'm sorry, we are completely sold out.

43
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:42,992
Listen, can you help me out for a second?
She's my little sister.

44
00:04:43,095 --> 00:04:44,356
She's April, l'm June,

45
00:04:44,463 --> 00:04:46,432
she's counting on me
to march her down the aisle tomorrow.

46
00:04:46,531 --> 00:04:47,896
That's very sweet,

47
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,593
but the 1 1 :50 will get you there
tomorrow morning with plenty of time.

48
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,228
Your boarding pass, sir?

49
00:04:55,074 --> 00:04:57,201
Sometimes things happen for a reason.

50
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,978
-Enjoy your flight, Mr. Miller.
-Thank you.

51
00:05:02,714 --> 00:05:06,115
<i>This is the final boarding call
for US Midland Air, flight 77</i>

52
00:05:06,218 --> 00:05:10,382
<i>non-stop service to Boston's
Logan Airport, now boarding at gate 12.</i>

53
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:13,050
<i>Would all passengers holding
a valid boarding pass, please proceed...</i>

54
00:05:13,158 --> 00:05:17,562
l should've seen it coming, boss.
He went on tilt, he came undone.

55
00:05:17,663 --> 00:05:20,130
Coming undone in our business
means you need a margarita.

56
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:23,430
lt doesn't mean capping a dozen people
in a government lab and blowing it up.

57
00:05:23,536 --> 00:05:26,004
<i>lt doesn't mean stealing an object
of critical importance.</i>

58
00:05:26,105 --> 00:05:28,596
<i>-Does he have the Zephyr or not?
-We believe so.</i>

59
00:05:30,408 --> 00:05:32,274
You believe so.

60
00:05:32,377 --> 00:05:34,812
<i>-Check it out.
-l don't care what you believe, Fitz.</i>

61
00:05:34,913 --> 00:05:36,904
<i>-l need you to clean your mess up.
-Go back and play it again.</i>

62
00:05:37,016 --> 00:05:38,108
<i>l want the Zephyr.</i>

63
00:05:38,216 --> 00:05:40,617
We'll have it in hand
by the time he lands in Boston.

64
00:05:42,187 --> 00:05:43,951
Find out who and what she is.

65
00:05:44,055 --> 00:05:47,822
Should l have the field office pick her up
in Wichita?

66
00:05:47,927 --> 00:05:49,120
l got a better idea.

67
00:05:52,197 --> 00:05:55,223
Miss Havens? We did find a seat for you.

68
00:05:57,235 --> 00:05:59,795
<i>l'd like to have your attention, please.
We apologize for the delay.</i>

69
00:05:59,906 --> 00:06:03,432
<i>We will be departing
Wichita Airport shortly.</i>

70
00:06:03,543 --> 00:06:05,442
<i>Thanks for your patience.</i>

71
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:11,480
l know it's policy or whatever
and it's just your job,

72
00:06:11,584 --> 00:06:14,451
-but it's kind of lame.
-Again, l apologize.

73
00:06:14,553 --> 00:06:16,886
Fitz. What did you do?

74
00:06:20,425 --> 00:06:23,793
lt's no wonder these airlines
are going out of business.

75
00:06:23,896 --> 00:06:25,795
<i>We have been cleared onto the runway.</i>

76
00:06:25,898 --> 00:06:27,331
There's nobody on the plane.

77
00:06:36,242 --> 00:06:38,505
<i>The captain has turned on
the ''fasten seatbelt'' sign.</i>

78
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,942
<i>Please remain seated
until the sign has been turned off</i>

79
00:06:41,047 --> 00:06:43,345
<i>and it's safe to move about the cabin.</i>

80
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:45,810
l'm June, by the way.

81
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:47,442
l'm Roy Miller.

82
00:06:47,853 --> 00:06:49,946
-Nice to meet you.
-lt's very nice to meet you.

83
00:06:51,891 --> 00:06:53,016
Tequila on the rocks?

84
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,252
Yeah. Just in time, thanks.

85
00:06:58,697 --> 00:07:01,598
So, your sister's
getting married tomorrow?

86
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,625
-Excuse me?
-Your sister.

87
00:07:03,735 --> 00:07:06,261
She's getting married tomorrow.
Congratulations.

88
00:07:06,372 --> 00:07:08,202
Yeah, thanks.

89
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:16,004
You know, Roy, l'm a bad liar.

90
00:07:16,115 --> 00:07:18,048
l'm sorry, how's that?

91
00:07:18,149 --> 00:07:20,879
April is getting married,
but not till Saturday.

92
00:07:20,987 --> 00:07:22,180
You had me fooled.

93
00:07:22,288 --> 00:07:27,692
Well, l do have a fitting tomorrow.
So, l do, actually, have to go home.

94
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,560
l hope this isn't gonna be a rough flight.

95
00:07:41,807 --> 00:07:43,240
lt might be.

96
00:07:46,312 --> 00:07:48,779
Wichita is a long way to go
for a carburetor.

97
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,314
lt's not just any carburetor.
lt's a triple deuce.

98
00:07:52,151 --> 00:07:53,812
l'm restoring a '66 GTO.

99
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:56,319
And Kansas has the best scrap.

100
00:07:56,422 --> 00:07:57,581
Really?

101
00:07:57,689 --> 00:07:59,213
My dad had a garage,

102
00:07:59,324 --> 00:08:02,122
and when l was a kid,
he bought this chassis.

103
00:08:02,228 --> 00:08:06,187
He used to take us to yards,
and search for parts, you know?

104
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:07,927
He died in '98,

105
00:08:08,033 --> 00:08:13,403
and now that April's getting married,
l just figured, why not finish it up,

106
00:08:13,505 --> 00:08:15,666
give it to her sort of as a wedding present?

107
00:08:16,442 --> 00:08:20,173
Kind of like a present
from our dad, too, you know?

108
00:08:20,278 --> 00:08:21,906
That's nice.

109
00:08:22,014 --> 00:08:23,742
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

110
00:08:33,525 --> 00:08:35,390
l used to think that

111
00:08:37,629 --> 00:08:41,566
someday, when the last part went in,

112
00:08:42,567 --> 00:08:45,934
l would just climb into that GTO
and start it up.

113
00:08:47,807 --> 00:08:50,537
Just drive and drive and drive,
and just keep driving

114
00:08:50,643 --> 00:08:53,908
until l got to the tip of South America.

115
00:08:54,947 --> 00:08:57,881
-Cape Horn.
-Yeah.

116
00:08:58,584 --> 00:09:01,849
-There's beautiful islands down there.
-Yeah?

117
00:09:01,953 --> 00:09:03,716
Pirate islands.

118
00:09:07,592 --> 00:09:09,993
Yeah, ''someday."
That's a dangerous word.

119
00:09:10,629 --> 00:09:11,596
Dangerous?

120
00:09:12,664 --> 00:09:15,827
lt's really just code for ''never."

121
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:21,967
l think a lot about things l haven't done.

122
00:09:22,073 --> 00:09:26,100
Dive in the Great Barrier Reef.
Ride the Orient Express.

123
00:09:26,946 --> 00:09:31,279
Live on the Amalfi Coast with nothing
but a motorcycle and a backpack.

124
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:35,245
Kiss a stranger on the balcony
of the Hotel Du Cap.

125
00:09:38,256 --> 00:09:39,417
Where is that?

126
00:09:39,524 --> 00:09:41,355
South of France.

127
00:09:44,864 --> 00:09:48,163
What about you? What's your list?

128
00:09:49,668 --> 00:09:53,000
Well, yours sounds pretty good.

129
00:09:57,009 --> 00:09:58,236
Wow.

130
00:10:00,446 --> 00:10:01,413
Thanks.

131
00:10:02,047 --> 00:10:03,480
lt's no problem.

132
00:10:05,049 --> 00:10:07,381
l'll just put this up here, if that's all right.

133
00:10:11,657 --> 00:10:13,750
You know what?

134
00:10:13,859 --> 00:10:16,884
l'm gonna go back and use the restroom.

135
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:20,254
-l'll help you.
-Thanks.

136
00:10:27,907 --> 00:10:29,932
Lots of turbulence, huh?

137
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,749
-l'll be out in a minute.
-Sure

138
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,817
''Kiss a stranger on the balcony
of the Hotel Du Cap''?

139
00:10:51,931 --> 00:10:53,523
l mean, what kind of a line is that?

140
00:10:58,403 --> 00:11:02,169
l mean, it's, like, a really good line.

141
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,070
Ma'am? Ma'am?

142
00:11:15,053 --> 00:11:17,385
Did you see his hands, by any chance?

143
00:11:17,489 --> 00:11:20,287
They just, like, snatched that bag
right out of the air.

144
00:11:20,392 --> 00:11:22,256
Lightning-fast reflexes.

145
00:11:25,798 --> 00:11:27,059
Not cool.

146
00:11:30,436 --> 00:11:31,697
Okay.

147
00:11:49,855 --> 00:11:51,379
This will help.

148
00:12:06,739 --> 00:12:09,673
Enough. lt's over, Roy.

149
00:12:10,142 --> 00:12:12,633
Yeah, l agree. Enough.

150
00:12:12,745 --> 00:12:14,474
Where's the Zephyr?

151
00:12:34,533 --> 00:12:37,661
Why is the girl on the plane? Tell me.

152
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:39,533
Why did Fitz put her on the plane?

153
00:12:42,508 --> 00:12:44,066
Don't move, Miller.

154
00:12:55,788 --> 00:12:58,450
So what are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?

155
00:12:58,557 --> 00:13:01,321
You're just gonna
let this opportunity pass you by?

156
00:13:01,427 --> 00:13:02,394
No, of course you're not.

157
00:13:02,494 --> 00:13:04,758
You're gonna walk right through that door,
you're gonna get it right.

158
00:13:04,863 --> 00:13:06,159
lt's not your first rodeo, woman.

159
00:13:19,812 --> 00:13:20,801
Hey.

160
00:13:29,288 --> 00:13:30,879
l decided to join you.

161
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:00,043
l'm sorry. l.. .

162
00:14:00,152 --> 00:14:03,144
-No, no, don't.. . lt's great.
-l'm sorry.

163
00:14:03,254 --> 00:14:05,222
lt's just, like, the tequila and the altitude
and everything.

164
00:14:05,323 --> 00:14:06,620
There's something l've gotta tell you.

165
00:14:06,725 --> 00:14:10,251
What? Oh, my God,
you're in a relationship. l'm so sorry.

166
00:14:10,361 --> 00:14:12,852
No, no, no. That's not it.

167
00:14:12,965 --> 00:14:15,865
Okay, l'm all ears. What is it?

168
00:14:19,303 --> 00:14:20,429
Are we landing?

169
00:14:21,173 --> 00:14:22,970
No, not yet.

170
00:14:24,676 --> 00:14:25,870
No?

171
00:14:25,977 --> 00:14:29,345
Listen, there's no need to panic. l have

172
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:32,115
contained the situation.

173
00:14:33,184 --> 00:14:34,777
Situation?

174
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,888
Yeah. We've lost the pilots.

175
00:14:40,491 --> 00:14:43,984
-Where did they go?
-l mean, they're dead.

176
00:14:44,096 --> 00:14:45,961
-The pilots are dead.
-Shot. lt's.. .

177
00:14:46,065 --> 00:14:47,554
Shot?

178
00:14:49,967 --> 00:14:51,196
By who?

179
00:14:53,672 --> 00:14:55,832
Well, me.

180
00:14:56,475 --> 00:14:58,442
Actually, l shot the first pilot.

181
00:14:58,543 --> 00:15:02,173
He shot the second pilot accidentally.
lt's just

182
00:15:05,183 --> 00:15:07,208
one of those things.

183
00:15:23,701 --> 00:15:26,192
Seriously, this is great!

184
00:15:26,738 --> 00:15:30,003
Really, l'm relieved
you are taking this so well.

185
00:15:35,746 --> 00:15:36,770
Where are you going?

186
00:15:36,881 --> 00:15:39,850
l'm just gonna go check on things
and think about landing.

187
00:15:39,951 --> 00:15:42,182
Would you mind
putting your seatbelt on for me?

188
00:15:42,287 --> 00:15:43,618
-That would be great.
-Yeah.

189
00:15:59,104 --> 00:16:00,969
This is weird.

190
00:16:16,187 --> 00:16:18,246
Mayday. Mayday.
This is US Midland Air 77 heavy.

191
00:16:18,356 --> 00:16:20,985
What's happening?
Everybody's dead out there!

192
00:16:21,092 --> 00:16:24,721
Come on in. Sit down.
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

193
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,821
-Everybody's dead in here.
-l'm declaring an emergency.

194
00:16:26,932 --> 00:16:29,298
-Oh, my God! Are we going down?
-l'm sorry?

195
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,493
Are we going down?

196
00:16:30,601 --> 00:16:32,899
No, June, it's just a rapid descent.
Please, sit down.

197
00:16:33,004 --> 00:16:34,665
<i>Please state your emergency, Midland 77.</i>

198
00:16:34,773 --> 00:16:36,331
l'm sorry,
l think l've heard enough of this guy.

199
00:16:36,441 --> 00:16:38,533
Are you a pilot? Who are you?

200
00:16:38,644 --> 00:16:39,668
The shoulder straps.

201
00:16:39,778 --> 00:16:43,304
You can put those over,
and it clicks in right down there.

202
00:16:43,414 --> 00:16:45,905
You wanna click it right there, that's it.

203
00:16:46,018 --> 00:16:49,009
Okay, l got it, l got it. Okay.. .

204
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,248
Gear down, showdown.

205
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,654
Why can't we just land in an airport?

206
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:57,354
No, no, that wouldn't be a good idea.

207
00:16:57,461 --> 00:17:00,124
-They'll be waiting for us.
-What do you mean? Waiting for us?

208
00:17:00,231 --> 00:17:02,894
-Who?
-l think the less you know, the better.

209
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,262
What?

210
00:17:05,002 --> 00:17:07,335
Okay, we're gonna touch down here.

211
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,669
Oh, God. Oh, my God!

212
00:17:15,513 --> 00:17:16,946
-That's a truck. That's a truck!
-Yeah.

213
00:17:17,048 --> 00:17:18,073
-That's a truck!
-Yup.

214
00:17:18,182 --> 00:17:19,207
That's a truck!

215
00:17:23,622 --> 00:17:25,249
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

216
00:17:30,162 --> 00:17:32,789
-That's a curve. That's a curve!
-l see it. l see it.

217
00:17:40,204 --> 00:17:41,501
Oh, my God!

218
00:17:43,241 --> 00:17:44,674
Oh, God!

219
00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:01,990
Okay, this is good.

220
00:18:02,094 --> 00:18:03,584
What's good?

221
00:18:07,031 --> 00:18:08,192
Take a sip of that.

222
00:18:08,834 --> 00:18:10,267
lt'll take the edge off.

223
00:18:16,842 --> 00:18:19,402
-Are you shot?
-Yeah, how about that?

224
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:22,844
lt's just a scrape. That's good news.

225
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,109
June, we have to

226
00:18:27,318 --> 00:18:29,583
discuss what's gonna happen next.

227
00:18:29,688 --> 00:18:32,349
You need to go to the hospital.
Prison, maybe?

228
00:18:32,457 --> 00:18:35,756
Some people are gonna come
looking for you now. Bad people.

229
00:18:36,295 --> 00:18:37,818
You know, l feel a little weird.

230
00:18:37,929 --> 00:18:41,160
Yeah, that'll pass once you fall asleep,
which should be in a couple of minutes.

231
00:18:41,266 --> 00:18:43,028
-What?
-l need you to listen, June.

232
00:18:43,134 --> 00:18:44,692
Did you drug me?

233
00:18:44,802 --> 00:18:45,997
Yes.

234
00:18:46,104 --> 00:18:48,367
-You drugged me.
-Yeah, it's for your own good.

235
00:18:48,472 --> 00:18:49,804
Now, look. These bad people

236
00:18:49,907 --> 00:18:53,207
who are going to come and see you,
they're gonna ask you about me. Okay?

237
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,609
And you need to tell them
you don't know me.

238
00:18:55,713 --> 00:18:57,045
-June? June?
-Okay.

239
00:18:57,148 --> 00:18:59,208
You need to tell them
you don't remember anything.

240
00:18:59,317 --> 00:19:02,219
And you need to avoid getting in
any vehicle with them at all costs.

241
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,288
Okay, who are ''them''?

242
00:19:04,388 --> 00:19:05,821
Well, they're serious people, June.

243
00:19:05,923 --> 00:19:09,654
They'll probably identify themselves
as federal agents, and they'll DlP you.

244
00:19:10,228 --> 00:19:12,991
Dip me? ln what?

245
00:19:13,097 --> 00:19:15,224
Dis-lnformation Protocol.
They'll tell you a story about me.

246
00:19:15,334 --> 00:19:18,269
About how l'm mentally unstable,
paranoid.

247
00:19:19,837 --> 00:19:23,604
How l'm violent and dangerous,
and it'll all sound very convincing.

248
00:19:23,709 --> 00:19:25,039
l'm already convinced.

249
00:19:25,143 --> 00:19:28,544
There's a few common DlP keywords
to listen for.

250
00:19:28,646 --> 00:19:33,106
Reassuring words.
Words like, ''stabilize,'' ''secure,'' ''safe."

251
00:19:33,218 --> 00:19:35,448
lf they say these words,
particularly with repetition.. .

252
00:19:35,554 --> 00:19:36,781
Okay.

253
00:19:36,887 --> 00:19:38,287
...it means they're going to kill you.

254
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,981
Oh, God!

255
00:19:40,092 --> 00:19:42,423
Or intern you somewhere offshore
for a very long time.

256
00:19:42,527 --> 00:19:43,960
-Okay?
-Okay.

257
00:19:44,061 --> 00:19:45,961
Now, stay with me.
lf they tell you you're safe.. .

258
00:19:46,064 --> 00:19:48,294
lf they tell me l'm safe,

259
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,423
they're gonna kill me.

260
00:19:50,535 --> 00:19:52,798
-Don't get in what?
-Vehicles.

261
00:19:53,438 --> 00:19:55,065
-Any vehicles.
-Okay, any vehicles.

262
00:19:55,173 --> 00:19:56,765
-Just run.
-l'll run.

263
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:57,898
-Run.
-Run.

264
00:19:58,009 --> 00:20:00,534
And if they ask you about me.. .

265
00:20:02,247 --> 00:20:05,114
l don't know you. l don't know you at all.

266
00:20:06,183 --> 00:20:08,152
Who are you, Roy?

267
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:55,156
<i>...a mixing of rain and snow,
good for ski country, but probably...</i>

268
00:20:56,567 --> 00:20:57,829
<i>-Thanks, Andrea.
-You're welcome.</i>

269
00:20:57,935 --> 00:20:59,800
<i>Now, back to our top news story
of the morning.</i>

270
00:20:59,904 --> 00:21:02,669
<i>Here's Bradley Moss,
with an on-the-scene report.</i>

271
00:21:02,773 --> 00:21:06,300
<i>According to FAA sources,
at approximately 7.:30 last night,</i>

272
00:21:06,411 --> 00:21:10,313
<i>all contact was lost with a
Boston-bound commuter jet from Wichita.</i>

273
00:21:10,414 --> 00:21:13,509
<i>The plane was apparently passing through
an area of turbulence</i>

274
00:21:13,617 --> 00:21:14,642
<i>and may have met up with wind shear</i>

275
00:21:14,752 --> 00:21:17,017
<i>or a lightning storm
causing an electrical failure.</i>

276
00:21:17,122 --> 00:21:19,556
<i>Now, this is all conjecture at this point,</i>

277
00:21:19,657 --> 00:21:21,682
<i>as all that's left is a crater
in an lndiana cornfield.</i>

278
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,192
Coming!

279
00:21:29,934 --> 00:21:31,367
Rodney?

280
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:35,037
Thank God.
l wanted to make sure you were okay.

281
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,163
Yeah, why?

282
00:21:36,273 --> 00:21:37,501
You were on that flight from Kansas, right?

283
00:21:37,608 --> 00:21:39,473
-Yeah.
-l saw on the news about the crash.

284
00:21:39,577 --> 00:21:41,010
What news? What crash?

285
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,843
-Anyway, you're alive.
-l'm alive, yeah.

286
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:49,579
Sure, that's cool.
Hey, but, June, you know.. .

287
00:21:49,688 --> 00:21:52,349
l told myself that if l found you alive,

288
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,421
that l was gonna ask you to dinner.

289
00:21:55,527 --> 00:21:57,426
How about l call you later, okay?

290
00:22:05,202 --> 00:22:09,230
lt's just another day.
lt's just a normal day. Okay.

291
00:22:13,845 --> 00:22:14,811
She's moving.

292
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,207
Wow!

293
00:22:18,016 --> 00:22:20,211
And gotta love the boots.

294
00:22:20,317 --> 00:22:23,219
Yeah, you know.

295
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,686
l promise l'll wear heels on the day.

296
00:22:25,789 --> 00:22:27,690
-Hey. Can l talk to you for a second?
-Yeah.

297
00:22:30,528 --> 00:22:34,157
So, this weekend,
l was thinking about Dad's GTO.

298
00:22:34,633 --> 00:22:37,692
-Really?
-Yeah, it's just sitting there.

299
00:22:37,801 --> 00:22:41,897
And l was wondering how you would feel
about maybe selling it.

300
00:22:42,641 --> 00:22:45,040
You wanna sell Dad's GTO?

301
00:22:45,143 --> 00:22:47,838
Ben and l, we really want our own place.

302
00:22:47,945 --> 00:22:49,072
Excuse me?

303
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:52,980
Excuse me. Anyone here belong
to that blue truck parked outside?

304
00:22:53,084 --> 00:22:55,244
-Yeah, why?
-You're about to get a ticket.

305
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,983
-Thought l put enough quarters in there.
-Yeah.

306
00:22:58,088 --> 00:23:00,147
l hate getting tickets.

307
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:02,357
Excuse me.

308
00:23:07,965 --> 00:23:09,023
Please step inside, miss.

309
00:23:11,569 --> 00:23:13,333
Let me just go grab a few things.

310
00:23:13,438 --> 00:23:16,669
Miss Havens, good afternoon.
Special Agent-in-Charge, Fitzgerald.

311
00:23:16,775 --> 00:23:19,743
Will you join us inside the car
for a moment?

312
00:23:20,644 --> 00:23:22,875
We know you were on the flight
with him last night.

313
00:23:23,048 --> 00:23:24,208
The one that crashed.

314
00:23:28,219 --> 00:23:29,208
Who are you again?

315
00:23:29,887 --> 00:23:33,153
FBl. You do know Mr. Miller.

316
00:23:33,758 --> 00:23:34,951
No, l don't.

317
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:45,394
Well, we chatted a little bit
before security, but.. .

318
00:23:45,502 --> 00:23:50,372
l see. And once you were on the flight,
what happened then? More chatting?

319
00:23:51,843 --> 00:23:53,572
-ls this funny to you?
-No.

320
00:23:53,677 --> 00:23:55,645
He's dangerous, Miss Havens,
and out of control.

321
00:23:58,048 --> 00:24:01,848
He said that you'd say he was crazy.

322
00:24:01,952 --> 00:24:04,386
So, you did talk to him.
And about me, no less.

323
00:24:04,489 --> 00:24:07,151
No. No, not you, specifically.

324
00:24:07,258 --> 00:24:08,987
About whom, then?

325
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,489
Simon Feck?

326
00:24:11,596 --> 00:24:14,394
l don't know who that is.

327
00:24:14,499 --> 00:24:20,300
Look, this is getting really twisted around,
and l think l should probably call a lawyer.

328
00:24:27,077 --> 00:24:31,344
We're gonna take you to a secure location,
Miss Havens, until Miller is contained.

329
00:24:31,449 --> 00:24:32,746
Someplace safe.

330
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:37,019
-With you?
-Yes, ma'am.

331
00:24:49,067 --> 00:24:50,465
You wanna tell me where we're going?

332
00:24:51,568 --> 00:24:54,163
-Fellas?
-Don't worry, miss, you're safe.

333
00:24:54,972 --> 00:24:55,997
Excuse me?

334
00:24:56,807 --> 00:24:58,069
You're safe with us.

335
00:24:58,175 --> 00:24:59,575
l wanna know where we're going.

336
00:24:59,677 --> 00:25:02,145
Just a shortcut
till the situation is stabilized.

337
00:25:03,013 --> 00:25:04,810
We'll keep you safe.

338
00:25:04,915 --> 00:25:06,348
You said that already.

339
00:25:07,285 --> 00:25:08,582
Because l meant it.

340
00:25:09,854 --> 00:25:11,821
What is Jackson doing?

341
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:19,125
Shooter! Shooter! Evade! Evade!
Shooter on the freeway.

342
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:20,423
The dot's on your back!

343
00:25:24,568 --> 00:25:25,626
Follow me, now!

344
00:25:25,737 --> 00:25:27,500
Are you insane?
l'm not going out that door!

345
00:25:36,948 --> 00:25:38,813
Oh, my God!

346
00:25:39,517 --> 00:25:40,506
Get your foot off.. .

347
00:25:56,366 --> 00:25:58,392
-Oh, my God!
-Hey, June!

348
00:25:58,502 --> 00:26:00,698
-l can't see!
-You are doing great.

349
00:26:00,805 --> 00:26:03,136
-l can't see! Get out of the way!
-Open the door.

350
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,935
-l can't get his foot off the gas.
-Open the door, June.

351
00:26:05,042 --> 00:26:07,943
Open the door, June.
That's a beautiful dress, by the way.

352
00:26:10,615 --> 00:26:11,843
One second.

353
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,643
Oh, my God!

354
00:26:25,696 --> 00:26:31,134
l totally know what you're talking about.
lt's so boring, l can't even stand it. Totally.

355
00:26:31,236 --> 00:26:32,327
Thank you.

356
00:26:38,542 --> 00:26:40,032
Who are you?

357
00:26:42,113 --> 00:26:43,272
Oh, God!

358
00:26:44,082 --> 00:26:45,276
What are you doing?

359
00:26:51,122 --> 00:26:52,782
-Hi, June.
-Move out of the way, l can't see!

360
00:26:52,891 --> 00:26:54,482
Please unlock the door, June.

361
00:26:56,795 --> 00:26:59,355
Unlock the door. That way, l can help you.

362
00:26:59,463 --> 00:27:01,295
-l can't let go!
-You need to let go, June.

363
00:27:10,842 --> 00:27:13,571
-June, door!
-Got it!

364
00:27:32,596 --> 00:27:34,861
Just pull over! Oh, my God!

365
00:27:45,876 --> 00:27:50,143
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Yup, come over here.

366
00:27:50,248 --> 00:27:52,239
Right over here.
Just stay down, you're doing good.

367
00:27:52,349 --> 00:27:54,943
Here, hold this. Well, well, well.

368
00:27:55,052 --> 00:27:56,576
Check this out.

369
00:27:57,521 --> 00:27:58,489
Nice.

370
00:27:58,589 --> 00:28:00,750
These guys are loaded for bear.

371
00:28:00,858 --> 00:28:01,951
You're doing well, June.

372
00:28:02,093 --> 00:28:05,085
Excellent driving.
Over a dead guy, no less.

373
00:28:05,195 --> 00:28:06,390
You're a natural.

374
00:28:07,365 --> 00:28:08,423
That's a beautiful dress.

375
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:10,789
ls that for April's wedding?

376
00:28:10,902 --> 00:28:12,596
-Saturday?
-Yeah.

377
00:28:12,703 --> 00:28:14,136
-Yeah, that will be nice.
-Yeah.

378
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:21,603
Please, stop shooting people, okay?

379
00:28:21,712 --> 00:28:24,546
-Just stop shooting people.
-l understand.

380
00:28:24,648 --> 00:28:26,276
You're in shock.

381
00:28:26,884 --> 00:28:28,978
How about you stay here

382
00:28:29,086 --> 00:28:31,782
while l go have a word
with the guys in the tunnel.

383
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:33,380
-Okay?
-Okay.

384
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:35,355
-Okay?
-Okay.

385
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,951
Actually, l'm just gonna go shoot them.
l'll be right back.

386
00:28:40,597 --> 00:28:42,531
By the way,
your timing when you opened that door.. .

387
00:28:42,634 --> 00:28:44,625
-Okay.
-.. was sublime.

388
00:28:44,736 --> 00:28:46,363
You saved us, l hope you know that.

389
00:28:46,471 --> 00:28:48,439
-You saved us.
-Okay.

390
00:29:15,532 --> 00:29:17,261
Hey! Hey!

391
00:29:17,367 --> 00:29:18,767
Oh, shoot.

392
00:29:23,942 --> 00:29:25,067
Hey, wait!

393
00:29:30,748 --> 00:29:32,271
Wait! Wait! Wait!

394
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:07,345
Oh, no.

395
00:30:07,451 --> 00:30:09,352
Excuse me, sorry.

396
00:30:11,288 --> 00:30:12,278
There you are.

397
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:14,655
June?

398
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,154
June?

399
00:30:25,936 --> 00:30:28,997
-Rodney?
-He's in the gym. Over there.

400
00:30:30,508 --> 00:30:31,906
-Hey!
-Hey!

401
00:30:32,643 --> 00:30:33,666
What are you doing here?

402
00:30:34,144 --> 00:30:37,443
Whoa ! That's a.. .
Hey, guys, say hello to June.

403
00:30:37,548 --> 00:30:39,674
-That's a dress.
-Thanks.

404
00:30:39,784 --> 00:30:41,615
-Everything all right?
-Yeah.

405
00:30:41,719 --> 00:30:43,516
No, it's.. .

406
00:30:44,922 --> 00:30:46,082
lt's complicated.

407
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:48,556
You know what?
l've been feeling the same way.

408
00:30:48,925 --> 00:30:50,119
You wanna talk?

409
00:30:50,228 --> 00:30:51,923
Maybe over some pie?

410
00:30:54,298 --> 00:30:55,697
My point is.. .

411
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:58,791
My point is,
that plane crash made me think

412
00:30:58,903 --> 00:31:00,028
about our break-up.

413
00:31:00,938 --> 00:31:02,565
You know, this bulb went off, bing!

414
00:31:02,673 --> 00:31:04,971
''Rodney, why are you giving up?
You're being passive."

415
00:31:05,076 --> 00:31:06,941
''Getting back at her
because she didn't want the ring."

416
00:31:07,045 --> 00:31:09,240
''So June didn't want
to be engaged right now,

417
00:31:09,346 --> 00:31:10,904
''and that freaks your mom out. Big deal!

418
00:31:11,015 --> 00:31:13,449
''What about all the things you
and June wanted to do together, huh?''

419
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:14,711
Our list, you know?

420
00:31:14,818 --> 00:31:17,583
Like camping in Vermont with my brother
and Sheila in their new Winnie.

421
00:31:17,688 --> 00:31:19,519
Tickets to Blue Man Group,
the battlegrounds tour.

422
00:31:19,624 --> 00:31:22,319
l wanna talk about the plane crash. Okay?

423
00:31:24,362 --> 00:31:25,420
Sure, what about it?

424
00:31:25,529 --> 00:31:28,327
l was on it. l mean, in it.

425
00:31:28,432 --> 00:31:29,593
l mean, l was in it.

426
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,166
So you were in the plane crash?

427
00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:33,066
l wasn't supposed to be on that plane,
but l was on it,

428
00:31:33,171 --> 00:31:38,131
and there was this guy who was some sort
of secret agent or something, and he.. .

429
00:31:39,477 --> 00:31:41,205
He killed everybody on board.

430
00:31:42,547 --> 00:31:45,516
And then he landed the plane.
Next thing you know,

431
00:31:45,615 --> 00:31:48,517
l wake up, l'm in my room.
l have no idea how l got there.

432
00:31:48,618 --> 00:31:50,779
He must've drugged me or something.
Then l go to April's fitting,

433
00:31:50,887 --> 00:31:52,913
because l have to wear
this ridiculous dress.

434
00:31:53,023 --> 00:31:55,515
These other guys, these other agents
come, they snatch me up.

435
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:58,288
<i>Next thing you know,
l'm in Grand Theft Auto on the l-93.</i>

436
00:31:58,395 --> 00:32:01,057
-Why are you touching my hand?
-Because l'm here for you.

437
00:32:01,164 --> 00:32:03,429
-Jeez, you are so stressed out!
-Well, yeah!

438
00:32:03,534 --> 00:32:05,125
-And l get it.
-Really?

439
00:32:05,236 --> 00:32:06,498
l completely understand. l mean.. .

440
00:32:07,538 --> 00:32:08,903
-Wow, June.
-l know.

441
00:32:09,006 --> 00:32:11,473
-Your little sister's getting married.. .
-lt's like.. .

442
00:32:11,576 --> 00:32:13,634
-.. and that is stressful.
-What are you talking about, Rodney?

443
00:32:13,743 --> 00:32:15,439
You didn't even listen
to what l was talking about.

444
00:32:15,546 --> 00:32:18,640
No, l did. Look, l would probably be
the same way in that situation.

445
00:32:18,749 --> 00:32:21,047
What can l do to help? Setting up?
We can bring the guys over.. .

446
00:32:21,152 --> 00:32:23,619
No, no, no. Okay.

447
00:32:23,721 --> 00:32:24,949
Oh, Christ.

448
00:32:26,124 --> 00:32:28,148
Hi, June. Look, l.. .

449
00:32:28,259 --> 00:32:30,192
l'm sorry if l'm interrupting anything, but.. .

450
00:32:31,362 --> 00:32:32,488
l'm Roy Miller.

451
00:32:33,396 --> 00:32:34,489
Rodney Burris.

452
00:32:34,598 --> 00:32:36,964
Rodney, hi. How are you?

453
00:32:38,169 --> 00:32:41,501
We're running out of time,
and maybe l didn't make it clear enough,

454
00:32:41,605 --> 00:32:46,042
but we're gonna have to stick together
for a little bit, because of our.. .

455
00:32:46,144 --> 00:32:47,736
You know, our situation.

456
00:32:48,746 --> 00:32:51,145
ln case you didn't notice,
Rodney is a fireman, okay?

457
00:32:51,249 --> 00:32:54,809
So he's perfectly capable of handling
any situation that comes up.

458
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:56,715
Thank you very much,
you can leave us alone.

459
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,015
l have no doubt.

460
00:32:58,122 --> 00:33:01,887
Ever since l was a little kid,
l have great respect for firemen.

461
00:33:01,992 --> 00:33:03,961
-l appreciate it.
-Fact of the matter is,

462
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,857
-l don't think you guys get paid enough.
-Yeah, we don't.

463
00:33:05,962 --> 00:33:06,987
You're in Engine 10.

464
00:33:07,932 --> 00:33:09,092
Yeah, Engine 10.

465
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,259
Yeah. Have you taken
your lieutenant's exam yet?

466
00:33:11,368 --> 00:33:14,201
-l'm working on it.
-Yeah? How's that going?

467
00:33:14,305 --> 00:33:15,567
lt's a bitch.

468
00:33:15,673 --> 00:33:17,470
Did you ever do a tour in that hall,
what is it?

469
00:33:17,607 --> 00:33:21,703
Grove Hall, that's where the action is.
lt's the fastest way up the ladder.

470
00:33:21,811 --> 00:33:23,836
-Rodney!
-House of Flames!

471
00:33:24,882 --> 00:33:26,747
l often thought l.. .

472
00:33:29,186 --> 00:33:31,279
l should have been a fireman.

473
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:35,018
Rodney, this is the guy.

474
00:33:36,259 --> 00:33:37,317
What?

475
00:33:38,528 --> 00:33:40,962
-This is the guy.
-What? ''This is the guy''?

476
00:33:41,865 --> 00:33:43,492
l'm sorry, who are you?

477
00:33:45,802 --> 00:33:47,134
l'm the guy?

478
00:33:48,439 --> 00:33:49,929
-l'm the guy. This is the guy.
-This is the guy.

479
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,473
-This is the guy.
-l'm a guy.

480
00:33:51,576 --> 00:33:53,042
-l'm the guy.
-You are a guy.

481
00:33:53,144 --> 00:33:56,113
-l'm a guy.
-He's the guy! He's the guy!

482
00:33:56,213 --> 00:33:58,910
-Rodney, whatever happens.. .
-God.

483
00:33:59,016 --> 00:34:00,983
-Please, for your own safety.. .
-Rodney, whatever happens,

484
00:34:01,085 --> 00:34:02,518
-you should know.. .
-.. .please stay in the booth.

485
00:34:03,086 --> 00:34:04,348
What are you talking about?

486
00:34:05,756 --> 00:34:06,722
Wait!

487
00:34:06,824 --> 00:34:09,054
Everybody! Everybody get down.

488
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:11,650
Get down, down, down! Everybody down.

489
00:34:11,762 --> 00:34:14,492
Rodney, get down,
or l will blow her head off.

490
00:34:14,632 --> 00:34:15,996
l'll blow her head off.

491
00:34:17,134 --> 00:34:18,465
What did l say?

492
00:34:18,568 --> 00:34:20,036
Rodney, what did l say?

493
00:34:20,137 --> 00:34:21,900
-Just calm down, buddy.
-Answer!

494
00:34:24,474 --> 00:34:26,500
Sorry, l thought you were making a move.

495
00:34:26,911 --> 00:34:29,811
Sorry. lt's all right,
l thought he was making a move.

496
00:34:29,914 --> 00:34:32,610
Making a little pie.
Pies for everybody. Everybody.

497
00:34:32,717 --> 00:34:34,947
Everybody gets pies, okay?
No ice-cream, à la mode.

498
00:34:35,052 --> 00:34:38,317
Weakens the legs, people. Lincoln knew it.
lt's why they got to him.

499
00:34:38,789 --> 00:34:42,418
No one follows us,
or l kill myself and then her.

500
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:52,699
-Get in the car. Please.
-No.

501
00:34:52,802 --> 00:34:53,894
Watch your head.

502
00:34:56,974 --> 00:34:59,237
We're at 560 Harris.
They're getting into a blue Volvo.

503
00:34:59,342 --> 00:35:01,503
-Rodney! Rodney!
-Rodney?

504
00:35:08,686 --> 00:35:10,550
Oh, my God! Rodney!

505
00:35:11,722 --> 00:35:13,121
lt's okay. Look at me.

506
00:35:13,224 --> 00:35:15,521
-Okay. Look at me, it's okay.
-Shit!

507
00:35:15,626 --> 00:35:18,617
l shot you through and through. No bone,
nowhere near the femoral artery, okay?

508
00:35:18,728 --> 00:35:19,717
All right?

509
00:35:19,829 --> 00:35:22,492
This is gonna be better for you
than Grove Hall. lt's all good.

510
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:24,864
Okay? You good?

511
00:35:24,969 --> 00:35:26,027
-Good?
-Good.

512
00:35:26,137 --> 00:35:27,364
Good?

513
00:35:47,123 --> 00:35:50,820
There were four security cameras
in that restaurant, June.

514
00:35:50,927 --> 00:35:53,021
Now there is proof you're my hostage.

515
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:55,257
So we've cleared your name,
with the locals, at least.

516
00:35:55,365 --> 00:35:58,391
You know? lt's a start.
Something to build on.

517
00:35:58,501 --> 00:36:01,596
-You shot Rodney!
-Yeah, l did.

518
00:36:01,706 --> 00:36:04,266
But l asked him to stay in the booth.

519
00:36:04,942 --> 00:36:06,534
You shot Rodney!

520
00:36:06,643 --> 00:36:08,668
lt might be the best thing
that ever happened to him.

521
00:36:08,778 --> 00:36:11,804
Yeah, right, because we all should
get shot every now and then!

522
00:36:11,916 --> 00:36:15,010
Rodney.. . Rodney is a good guy, June.

523
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,518
But not really right for you.

524
00:36:17,621 --> 00:36:20,612
l mean, you know, in my opinion.
But a good guy.

525
00:36:20,724 --> 00:36:24,092
Took a bullet, he's gonna be a hero.
Probably get a promotion.

526
00:36:24,195 --> 00:36:25,923
-Stop the car. Stop the car.
-What?

527
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:28,429
Stop the car. Stop the car.
Stop the car. Just stop the car!

528
00:36:28,532 --> 00:36:30,693
June, l understand
you want off the carousel.

529
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,927
l do, l wanna get off the carousel.
Please, Roy.

530
00:36:33,036 --> 00:36:34,867
Can you stop the car, please? Right now!

531
00:36:34,972 --> 00:36:36,963
l'm not one of those
''l told you so'' kind of guys,

532
00:36:37,074 --> 00:36:39,735
but l did warn you
to stay off the plane last night.

533
00:36:40,811 --> 00:36:41,835
When?

534
00:36:41,945 --> 00:36:45,382
Well, when l said,
''Sometimes things happen for a reason."

535
00:36:47,217 --> 00:36:51,085
That's not a warning.
That's not a warning, Roy!

536
00:36:51,188 --> 00:36:54,554
That's like a needlepoint expression
or a bumper sticker.

537
00:36:54,657 --> 00:36:58,822
Next time, try, ''June, if you get
on this plane, you will fucking die! ''

538
00:37:00,097 --> 00:37:03,032
You know, Roy, maybe they meant it
when they said that l would be safe.

539
00:37:04,001 --> 00:37:06,469
-You really mean that, June?
-Yeah!

540
00:37:07,471 --> 00:37:12,170
-Did you feel safe with them?
-Safer than l do now!

541
00:37:12,275 --> 00:37:15,039
Okay, okay. All right.

542
00:37:39,536 --> 00:37:41,630
Just so you understand,

543
00:37:41,739 --> 00:37:45,539
right now, out there, on your own,
your life expectancy is like here.

544
00:37:45,643 --> 00:37:48,134
With me, it's here. Without me, here.

545
00:37:48,244 --> 00:37:52,079
With me, without me.
With me, without me.

546
00:37:52,182 --> 00:37:53,809
So.. .

547
00:37:53,918 --> 00:37:57,284
l wouldn't advise going home.
But, you know, it's up to you.

548
00:37:57,387 --> 00:37:59,083
So right now l need another car,
keep moving.

549
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:02,387
Someone else is depending on me.
Someone whose life is in danger.

550
00:38:02,492 --> 00:38:06,121
Someone who trusts me.
Every second l waste chasing you,

551
00:38:06,697 --> 00:38:09,028
l'm letting him down.

552
00:38:55,713 --> 00:38:59,307
<i>Rodney, why did you make this brave call
to leap into action?</i>

553
00:38:59,416 --> 00:39:00,440
<i>Well, l didn't think.</i>

554
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:02,815
<i>l just did what any man would do
in that situation, you know?</i>

555
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,614
<i>-l leapt into action.
-Thanks.</i>

556
00:39:04,722 --> 00:39:07,748
<i>-Like you said, it's really the job.
-You should be so proud.</i>

557
00:39:07,858 --> 00:39:08,983
<i>-Thanks.
-Good job.</i>

558
00:39:09,092 --> 00:39:11,721
<i>lt really didn't even hurt.
lt was kind of like a bee sting.</i>

559
00:39:11,829 --> 00:39:13,023
<i>What a brave firefighter.</i>

560
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:17,032
<i>The doctors tell me Rodney is going
to be okay, just a flesh wound.</i>

561
00:39:17,134 --> 00:39:21,434
<i>A true blue Boston hero. Back to you, Don.</i>

562
00:39:37,054 --> 00:39:38,179
This is what it's all about.

563
00:39:38,922 --> 00:39:41,221
That, right there,
is what everybody wants.

564
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,192
A Burger King toy?

565
00:39:47,297 --> 00:39:48,492
Open it up.

566
00:39:57,041 --> 00:39:58,530
lt's warm. What is it?

567
00:39:59,342 --> 00:40:00,708
A battery.

568
00:40:01,445 --> 00:40:02,434
A battery?

569
00:40:03,514 --> 00:40:06,210
lt's code-named Zephyr.
Not your average Duracell.

570
00:40:07,751 --> 00:40:10,652
lt's high output. Never runs out.

571
00:40:10,753 --> 00:40:12,186
What do you mean, ''never''?

572
00:40:12,289 --> 00:40:17,454
That little thing there is the first
perpetual energy source since the sun.

573
00:40:17,561 --> 00:40:21,496
So, what, your flashlight
never runs out of juice?

574
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,090
lt can power a lot more
than a flashlight, June.

575
00:40:24,201 --> 00:40:26,465
Really? How much more?

576
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:29,596
Small city.

577
00:40:29,706 --> 00:40:31,173
Large submarine.

578
00:40:33,344 --> 00:40:34,367
lt's big.

579
00:40:35,813 --> 00:40:37,007
The guy who invented it

580
00:40:37,581 --> 00:40:40,014
is barely out of high school.

581
00:40:40,117 --> 00:40:42,641
Simon Feck.

582
00:40:42,753 --> 00:40:46,780
l was assigned with another agent to
watch him at a facility, a lab in Wichita.

583
00:40:46,889 --> 00:40:51,019
And the other guy, the agent, is the guy
who picked you up this morning.

584
00:40:52,195 --> 00:40:53,958
Fitzgerald.

585
00:40:55,298 --> 00:41:00,396
A couple of weeks ago, l found out
he was going to sell the battery

586
00:41:00,503 --> 00:41:01,731
and kill Simon.

587
00:41:03,907 --> 00:41:05,635
So l got Simon out of there,

588
00:41:05,742 --> 00:41:09,405
put him someplace safe
and went back for the battery.

589
00:41:09,512 --> 00:41:14,177
And Fitz set me up.
Made it look like l went rogue.

590
00:41:19,056 --> 00:41:21,650
That's when l met you.

591
00:41:29,932 --> 00:41:31,490
So.. .

592
00:41:33,804 --> 00:41:36,739
So, what's next? l mean, what's the plan?

593
00:41:37,474 --> 00:41:38,838
l think we get some rest,

594
00:41:38,942 --> 00:41:42,639
pick up Simon, and get you back
for your sister's wedding.

595
00:41:45,315 --> 00:41:48,545
l'm pretty good at what l do, June.

596
00:41:48,652 --> 00:41:51,780
And tonight, we're safe.

597
00:41:52,655 --> 00:41:54,385
Scout's honor.

598
00:41:56,092 --> 00:41:57,684
Safe and secure?

599
00:42:05,369 --> 00:42:07,336
Good night, Roy.

600
00:42:11,141 --> 00:42:13,302
Were you really a Boy Scout?

601
00:42:15,278 --> 00:42:17,644
Eagle Scout.

602
00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:21,976
l was a Brownie.

603
00:42:22,085 --> 00:42:23,610
That's cool.

604
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:29,659
Good night, Roy.

605
00:42:46,844 --> 00:42:48,436
<i>Pies for everybody. Everybody.</i>

606
00:42:48,545 --> 00:42:51,378
<i>Everybody gets pies, okay?
No ice-cream...</i>

607
00:42:52,849 --> 00:42:55,978
So, what do you think?
Are we looking at another player?

608
00:42:56,085 --> 00:42:59,851
We're looking at a pawn.
l talked to her, so did he.

609
00:42:59,956 --> 00:43:03,222
She owns a garage, no passport,
gone nowhere, been nowhere.

610
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,952
She's a nobody.

611
00:43:05,061 --> 00:43:08,896
You've been two steps behind
since this began, Fitz.

612
00:43:08,998 --> 00:43:11,331
Are you sure someone
is not taking you to school?

613
00:43:11,434 --> 00:43:12,958
Clean this shit up.

614
00:43:32,588 --> 00:43:35,056
This is a safe-house?

615
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:37,958
Simon!

616
00:43:45,235 --> 00:43:46,929
Simon?

617
00:43:51,307 --> 00:43:52,831
Stay close.

618
00:43:55,278 --> 00:43:59,045
Hey, Simon, this is no time to play.

619
00:44:12,563 --> 00:44:15,463
What is all this?

620
00:44:15,565 --> 00:44:18,364
Simon. lt's what he does.

621
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:22,467
l'm late, and he's gone.

622
00:45:12,289 --> 00:45:13,255
Simon.

623
00:45:35,177 --> 00:45:37,976
''Made in Austria."

624
00:45:52,295 --> 00:45:55,025
Who are these people?
Are they Fitzgerald's guys?

625
00:45:55,132 --> 00:45:57,599
No, it's other guys.

626
00:45:57,701 --> 00:45:59,498
Other bad guys?

627
00:45:59,603 --> 00:46:02,264
Worse guys. Hold my mags.

628
00:46:03,373 --> 00:46:05,068
Worse guys?

629
00:46:05,175 --> 00:46:08,610
Now, l need you to listen carefully.
Do exactly as l say.

630
00:46:08,711 --> 00:46:11,271
On three, l'm gonna lay down cover,

631
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:13,371
then we're gonna run
to those shelves over there.

632
00:46:13,483 --> 00:46:14,449
Okay.

633
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:15,518
-Okay?
-Yeah.

634
00:46:15,619 --> 00:46:16,916
-You ready?
-Yeah.

635
00:46:17,019 --> 00:46:18,213
One.. .

636
00:46:22,391 --> 00:46:24,257
Oh, my God!

637
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,751
Sorry. l panicked.

638
00:46:28,331 --> 00:46:31,130
-What number would you like?
-Let's just stick with three, it's good.

639
00:46:31,233 --> 00:46:33,293
Okay. One.. . Two.. .

640
00:46:33,402 --> 00:46:34,563
Three.

641
00:46:46,583 --> 00:46:49,882
These guys are fancy. Mags.

642
00:46:49,987 --> 00:46:55,253
Could be Antonio Quintana's men.
He's a Spanish arms dealer.

643
00:46:55,358 --> 00:46:58,293
He also wants the battery.

644
00:46:58,394 --> 00:46:59,362
Ready?

645
00:46:59,463 --> 00:47:01,327
-Let's move.
-Okay.

646
00:47:03,132 --> 00:47:04,862
June. June!

647
00:47:06,135 --> 00:47:09,469
How the hell are we gonna get out of here?

648
00:47:09,572 --> 00:47:11,130
And where the hell is Simon?

649
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,606
l don't know yet, but he left a message.

650
00:47:12,708 --> 00:47:14,574
-A message?
-Wait.

651
00:47:21,952 --> 00:47:24,784
What l need you to do right now
is wait here.

652
00:47:24,887 --> 00:47:26,856
-What?
-Yeah. l'm gonna find us a way out.

653
00:47:26,956 --> 00:47:28,753
-l can't wait here!
-l'll be right back.

654
00:47:28,858 --> 00:47:29,847
Wait! Roy!

655
00:47:30,494 --> 00:47:31,755
Just take this.

656
00:47:44,007 --> 00:47:45,530
Roy?

657
00:47:46,476 --> 00:47:48,034
Shit.

658
00:47:50,179 --> 00:47:51,168
June?

659
00:47:52,282 --> 00:47:55,445
June! June! June! June!

660
00:47:56,286 --> 00:47:59,152
June! June! June! June!

661
00:48:02,259 --> 00:48:03,282
June!

662
00:48:03,393 --> 00:48:04,757
Please stop saying my name.

663
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:06,623
You keep saying my name,
it's freaking me out.

664
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:10,860
-Okay. l understand.
-Okay.

665
00:48:13,335 --> 00:48:14,427
-Drink this.
-What is it?

666
00:48:14,538 --> 00:48:16,505
Brotine-zero.
They're gonna smoke us with D-5.

667
00:48:16,606 --> 00:48:17,936
Oh, yeah.

668
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:20,976
Where's yours?

669
00:48:24,914 --> 00:48:26,507
Oh, shit.

670
00:48:26,615 --> 00:48:27,913
-l'm sorry.
-Oh, no.

671
00:48:28,018 --> 00:48:29,349
They're coming.

672
00:48:46,869 --> 00:48:47,836
June.

673
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:53,106
l know this looks bad,

674
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:55,974
but we'll be out of here

675
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:59,047
in a couple of minutes.

676
00:48:59,148 --> 00:49:00,240
l got this.

677
00:49:05,789 --> 00:49:08,485
We gotta go, June. Here, l'll help you.

678
00:49:19,135 --> 00:49:20,534
We've been hit!

679
00:49:20,637 --> 00:49:22,831
But it's okay!

680
00:49:22,938 --> 00:49:25,338
We get through this, we're home free!

681
00:49:25,442 --> 00:49:27,967
Ready, set, go!

682
00:49:39,889 --> 00:49:41,914
We're almost there.

683
00:50:27,903 --> 00:50:29,268
Hey, there, sleepy head.

684
00:50:39,215 --> 00:50:40,273
How long have l been out?

685
00:50:40,951 --> 00:50:42,713
Eighteen hours.

686
00:50:44,621 --> 00:50:46,452
Where am l?

687
00:50:47,389 --> 00:50:49,358
My place.

688
00:50:51,161 --> 00:50:52,150
We're off-grid.

689
00:50:53,262 --> 00:50:54,695
No one's ever found me here.

690
00:50:55,231 --> 00:50:58,166
Shame we can't stay longer.
We got a rendezvous with Simon.

691
00:50:58,268 --> 00:51:01,168
He's fine. l figured out his code.

692
00:51:02,172 --> 00:51:03,605
He's crazy about trains.

693
00:51:03,706 --> 00:51:06,436
He used the passport l gave him
and went to Austria.

694
00:51:06,543 --> 00:51:07,601
You drugged me again, Roy.

695
00:51:08,878 --> 00:51:09,969
Yeah.

696
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,039
You can't do that.

697
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:16,447
Well, you weren't coping well.

698
00:51:16,552 --> 00:51:20,489
l'm not sure, if you were awake,
if they would've even let you live.

699
00:51:21,358 --> 00:51:22,347
What am l wearing?

700
00:51:27,063 --> 00:51:29,293
A bikini. We're in the tropics.

701
00:51:29,398 --> 00:51:31,492
How did l get in the bikini?

702
00:51:35,338 --> 00:51:39,501
June, l've been trained
to dismantle a bomb in the pitch black

703
00:51:39,608 --> 00:51:43,237
with nothing but a safety pin
and a Junior Mint.

704
00:51:43,346 --> 00:51:46,907
l think l can get you in and out
of some clothes without

705
00:51:47,951 --> 00:51:49,009
looking.

706
00:51:53,123 --> 00:51:55,556
l'm not saying that's what l did, but.. .

707
00:51:55,659 --> 00:51:58,650
Okay. Sorry. Reflex.

708
00:51:59,362 --> 00:52:02,092
l deserved that. Hit me again.

709
00:52:02,197 --> 00:52:03,994
l won't stop you.

710
00:52:05,802 --> 00:52:06,791
June.

711
00:52:09,271 --> 00:52:10,260
June?

712
00:52:12,809 --> 00:52:13,900
June!

713
00:52:15,244 --> 00:52:17,644
...paper clips and Junior Mints.. .

714
00:52:20,817 --> 00:52:22,784
''Not that l'm saying that's what l did."

715
00:52:25,822 --> 00:52:26,880
Shit!

716
00:52:32,961 --> 00:52:34,623
ls this his phone?

717
00:52:39,135 --> 00:52:40,534
Movement alert.

718
00:52:44,407 --> 00:52:45,601
Amapola.

719
00:52:47,510 --> 00:52:49,443
That's a '67 Grand Prix.

720
00:52:58,355 --> 00:53:00,585
l thought we were off the grid.

721
00:53:01,257 --> 00:53:02,382
April.

722
00:53:02,992 --> 00:53:04,117
April?

723
00:53:04,693 --> 00:53:09,358
April! l know! No, l'm okay!
Listen, April.. . April? April?

724
00:53:10,199 --> 00:53:12,724
April, can you hear me? April!

725
00:53:13,536 --> 00:53:15,163
April, can you.. .

726
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:26,605
<i>l know! No, l'm okay!
Listen, April... April?</i>

727
00:53:26,715 --> 00:53:28,945
<i>April, can you hear me? April!</i>

728
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:32,014
We don't know, Antonio.

729
00:53:32,121 --> 00:53:35,523
We traced her phone to the Azores.
We're in range now.

730
00:53:37,393 --> 00:53:39,623
Get to them before the agency.

731
00:53:46,902 --> 00:53:49,871
Perfect timing. Lunch is ready.

732
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:53,070
You must be thirsty.

733
00:53:58,148 --> 00:54:01,014
lt's coconut. lt's loaded with electrolytes.

734
00:54:03,987 --> 00:54:05,715
Just.. . Whoa. Okay?

735
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:11,248
Okay. Just.. . Whoa.

736
00:54:12,394 --> 00:54:13,418
Yeah?

737
00:54:14,496 --> 00:54:15,588
Yeah!

738
00:54:16,666 --> 00:54:18,429
Hey. You got skills.

739
00:54:20,737 --> 00:54:22,762
-My dad wanted boys.
-Yeah?

740
00:54:23,373 --> 00:54:26,603
-Let me go.
-You can get out anytime you want.

741
00:54:26,708 --> 00:54:28,199
l'll show you.

742
00:54:29,278 --> 00:54:31,269
Hands like Houdini.

743
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:33,177
Turn your palms down,

744
00:54:33,583 --> 00:54:35,141
and all at once,

745
00:54:35,684 --> 00:54:38,847
throw your hands to the ground
and your hips back.

746
00:54:42,324 --> 00:54:43,382
Nice.

747
00:54:44,393 --> 00:54:45,827
That was good.

748
00:55:02,211 --> 00:55:03,577
Who are you?

749
00:55:05,748 --> 00:55:06,907
Really.

750
00:55:21,965 --> 00:55:23,454
l don't understand.

751
00:55:26,001 --> 00:55:27,161
Follow me.

752
00:55:42,184 --> 00:55:44,710
l don't understand. l came in clean.

753
00:55:46,588 --> 00:55:50,422
My phone is secure. lt's secure.
Unless you made a call.

754
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:53,724
-And you didn't make a call.
-No, l didn't make a call.

755
00:55:53,829 --> 00:55:55,320
l took a call.

756
00:55:57,599 --> 00:55:58,760
You took a call?

757
00:55:59,469 --> 00:56:00,527
lt was a quick one.

758
00:56:00,969 --> 00:56:02,096
You.. .

759
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:05,807
Come on.

760
00:56:06,909 --> 00:56:08,036
l thought we were off the grid,

761
00:56:08,143 --> 00:56:09,338
-and then the phone rang.
-lt's okay.

762
00:56:09,445 --> 00:56:10,934
lt was my sister and l had to take the call.

763
00:56:11,047 --> 00:56:14,311
-You know? l didn't want her to worry.
-Watch your step.

764
00:56:17,954 --> 00:56:19,181
No, no, no.. .

765
00:56:19,289 --> 00:56:21,313
l can't get into that.
l just can't get into that thing.

766
00:56:21,623 --> 00:56:22,920
l can't get into that.

767
00:56:24,527 --> 00:56:25,755
-June.
-Roy.. .

768
00:56:25,961 --> 00:56:29,090
Just, please, knock me out.
Use broton-seven or whatever.

769
00:56:29,798 --> 00:56:31,630
-lt's okay.
-You're grabbing my neck.

770
00:56:31,733 --> 00:56:33,257
You asked me not to drug you.

771
00:56:33,603 --> 00:56:35,070
Okay, good.

772
00:56:45,648 --> 00:56:49,481
Hands like Houdini. Hands.. .

773
00:57:10,907 --> 00:57:11,931
Roy?

774
00:57:19,081 --> 00:57:21,550
-l can't feel my face!
-Okay, time.

775
00:57:21,751 --> 00:57:22,911
Okay, Simon.. .

776
00:57:24,721 --> 00:57:26,347
Roy, the pull on this thing.. .

777
00:57:26,456 --> 00:57:28,117
-We said 10 minutes.
-The traction on this thing.

778
00:57:28,224 --> 00:57:31,351
-lt can pull up to 50,000 metric tons!
-l get it.

779
00:57:33,896 --> 00:57:34,954
lt's a diesel hydraulic!

780
00:57:35,164 --> 00:57:36,858
Don't you wanna see your Zephyr?

781
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:38,623
Yes.

782
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:56,114
<i>-Excuse me.
-Guten Morgen, miss.</i>

783
00:57:56,219 --> 00:57:57,208
Can you tell me where we are?

784
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:58,786
Right now, miss? We are in Austria.

785
00:57:59,222 --> 00:58:00,655
Austria, huh?

786
00:58:02,090 --> 00:58:04,286
Would you like some breakfast, miss?

787
00:58:04,393 --> 00:58:06,793
Yeah, that would be great. Thanks.

788
00:58:08,331 --> 00:58:10,697
Okay, l'm gonna have some pancakes,

789
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:11,994
scrambled eggs.. .

790
00:58:12,101 --> 00:58:13,295
-Scrambled eggs.
-.. and.. .

791
00:58:13,402 --> 00:58:14,664
With a glass of milk.

792
00:58:14,771 --> 00:58:15,795
And a glass of milk.

793
00:58:15,905 --> 00:58:18,931
-Can l get a Harvey Wallbanger, please?
-Certainly, sir.

794
00:58:23,445 --> 00:58:26,938
You know, statistically, you're a lot
more likely to die riding on a train

795
00:58:27,050 --> 00:58:28,880
than any other form of transportation.

796
00:58:31,454 --> 00:58:34,047
10.3 times more likely
than dying on a plane.

797
00:58:35,858 --> 00:58:36,824
Simon?

798
00:58:39,228 --> 00:58:40,195
Simon Feck?

799
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:41,719
Yes.

800
00:58:43,298 --> 00:58:46,233
My name is June.
l'm a friend of Roy Miller's.

801
00:58:47,804 --> 00:58:49,532
Have you found him yet?
Have you seen him?

802
00:58:49,639 --> 00:58:51,038
No, not yet.

803
00:58:52,007 --> 00:58:54,237
-Don't you wanna answer that?
-Yeah.

804
00:58:54,844 --> 00:58:55,811
But l can't.

805
00:58:55,911 --> 00:58:57,469
l'm not supposed to.

806
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:58,871
lt might be Roy.

807
00:58:58,981 --> 00:59:03,384
Yeah, but he told me not to answer the
phone, because the signal can be tracked.

808
00:59:03,485 --> 00:59:05,282
That's right. Of course.

809
00:59:13,695 --> 00:59:16,391
Did Roy happen to tell you
about the plan here?

810
00:59:16,498 --> 00:59:18,659
Are we supposed to meet him here, or.. .

811
00:59:19,302 --> 00:59:20,826
What did you say that drink was?

812
00:59:20,936 --> 00:59:23,268
-A Harvey.. .
-lt's a Harvey Wallbanger.

813
00:59:23,539 --> 00:59:25,302
Do you mind just
ordering me one of those?

814
00:59:25,407 --> 00:59:27,170
Because it looks great.

815
00:59:27,275 --> 00:59:29,300
l'll just be right back.
You just stay here for a second.

816
00:59:29,411 --> 00:59:31,072
l'll be right back.

817
00:59:31,547 --> 00:59:34,914
Something is wrong.
lt's getting hotter, Roy.

818
00:59:35,016 --> 00:59:36,643
She didn't answer her phone.

819
00:59:36,753 --> 00:59:38,880
-l told her not to. That's.. .
-We just got here.

820
00:59:38,987 --> 00:59:41,286
-That's good news.
-l'm sure she'll turn up. Roy.. .

821
00:59:41,389 --> 00:59:44,222
-l left a note posted right there.
-We may have an issue here.

822
00:59:44,327 --> 00:59:47,659
-The temperature.. .
-She's hungry.. . She's hungry.

823
00:59:47,764 --> 00:59:50,391
lt's getting too hot.
We need to cool it down.

824
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:52,434
Yeah, she went to get something to eat.

825
00:59:52,534 --> 00:59:54,195
Good. Come on, Simon.

826
01:00:19,996 --> 01:00:22,327
-May l help you?
-Yeah.

827
01:00:22,431 --> 01:00:23,523
l'm feeling a little bit train-sick.

828
01:00:23,632 --> 01:00:25,099
ls it okay if l hang out here for a while?

829
01:00:25,201 --> 01:00:27,795
Of course, l will get you some water.

830
01:00:29,938 --> 01:00:30,905
Here you go.

831
01:00:39,514 --> 01:00:41,744
Antonio Quintana wants to know

832
01:00:41,851 --> 01:00:43,784
where is the battery?

833
01:00:53,295 --> 01:00:54,990
Where is the battery?

834
01:01:08,443 --> 01:01:11,311
l'm sorry, l'm looking for ice.

835
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:12,769
-Roy.
-Bernhard.

836
01:01:12,882 --> 01:01:13,849
Miller.

837
01:01:13,949 --> 01:01:16,577
-Wrong room.
-lt's okay. lt's okay.

838
01:01:16,686 --> 01:01:18,585
-You know him?
-Yeah.

839
01:01:18,688 --> 01:01:22,748
He's an assassin, platinum grade.
He's come to collect Simon.

840
01:01:22,858 --> 01:01:23,847
Oh, my God.

841
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:26,224
-And to kill you.
-That's Simon?

842
01:01:26,329 --> 01:01:28,422
-Yeah, June, Simon. Simon, June.
-Hi.

843
01:01:33,436 --> 01:01:35,927
Jeez! l'm okay. l got this.

844
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,380
Simon, please move.

845
01:02:00,061 --> 01:02:03,030
<i>You have quite some balls, Fraulein.</i>

846
01:02:04,367 --> 01:02:06,027
Hands like Houdini.

847
01:02:14,677 --> 01:02:16,110
l'm so sorry.

848
01:02:18,713 --> 01:02:20,978
But you were trying to kill me.

849
01:02:33,528 --> 01:02:34,927
That's disgusting.

850
01:02:43,172 --> 01:02:45,663
Oh, my God. Just die!

851
01:02:49,010 --> 01:02:49,978
Oh, shit.

852
01:02:51,681 --> 01:02:54,615
l got to get you guys someplace safe.

853
01:03:03,893 --> 01:03:06,293
-They're not on the train.
-Oh, really?

854
01:03:06,394 --> 01:03:08,123
Cameras at the last station show nothing.

855
01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:10,356
They must have gotten off
between stops.

856
01:03:10,465 --> 01:03:12,228
Locals haven't found anything.

857
01:03:43,199 --> 01:03:45,166
Always the classics, Roy.

858
01:03:58,748 --> 01:04:01,978
Salzburg, Austria. Very nice.

859
01:04:15,264 --> 01:04:16,389
Yes.

860
01:04:19,934 --> 01:04:21,766
No, we just got in.

861
01:04:23,204 --> 01:04:26,298
Well, we're talking now. No, l understand.

862
01:04:26,574 --> 01:04:28,599
Well, it's good to hear your voice,
too, Naomi.

863
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:31,702
l'll meet you at the caprice.
As soon as you can be there.

864
01:04:40,755 --> 01:04:42,815
lt's a beautiful city, huh?

865
01:04:43,626 --> 01:04:44,684
Yeah.

866
01:04:46,027 --> 01:04:48,427
Never seen anything quite like it.

867
01:04:54,402 --> 01:04:55,927
Neither have l.

868
01:04:59,175 --> 01:05:00,802
l got to go out for a bit.

869
01:05:02,811 --> 01:05:03,972
Okay.

870
01:05:04,246 --> 01:05:07,306
l was thinking about ordering
some room service.

871
01:05:08,818 --> 01:05:12,378
And l thought maybe we could
have dinner or something.

872
01:05:12,588 --> 01:05:14,385
That sounds great.

873
01:05:15,623 --> 01:05:16,590
9:00?

874
01:05:18,494 --> 01:05:19,960
9:00 sounds great.

875
01:05:23,364 --> 01:05:24,389
June?

876
01:05:26,168 --> 01:05:30,661
Could you do me a favor
and just stick around here? lt's better.

877
01:05:31,139 --> 01:05:34,597
Oh, yeah, of course.
Where else am l gonna go?

878
01:05:34,809 --> 01:05:36,367
See you in a bit.

879
01:05:41,016 --> 01:05:44,246
They're not gonna hurt you.
You're too valuable to them.

880
01:05:44,353 --> 01:05:46,286
Now, just breathe, listen to your music.

881
01:05:46,387 --> 01:05:48,356
Here, as a matter of fact,
l got that for you.

882
01:05:49,824 --> 01:05:51,052
l know you like them.

883
01:05:51,159 --> 01:05:52,251
Cool, thanks.

884
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:56,922
Listen, order as much room service
as you like, but don't leave the room.

885
01:05:57,298 --> 01:05:58,492
Okay.

886
01:05:59,501 --> 01:06:02,369
-We need to talk about the Zephyr later.
-And we will.

887
01:07:29,757 --> 01:07:31,452
You seem different.

888
01:07:32,594 --> 01:07:33,619
Do l?

889
01:07:36,632 --> 01:07:38,862
So, who's your companion?

890
01:07:39,802 --> 01:07:42,032
She's beautiful. The blonde.

891
01:07:42,637 --> 01:07:44,264
She seems capable.

892
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:46,739
l just met her.

893
01:07:47,842 --> 01:07:49,639
She's a nobody.

894
01:07:49,844 --> 01:07:53,576
Just someone l picked up along the way.

895
01:07:54,483 --> 01:07:55,813
That's a shame.

896
01:07:57,619 --> 01:08:00,918
This is getting boring.
Are we gonna do a deal or not?

897
01:08:03,626 --> 01:08:05,753
Don't speak to me like that.

898
01:08:07,929 --> 01:08:10,797
l will speak to you any way l please, Tony.

899
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,626
We both know you're lucky l'm here.

900
01:08:15,304 --> 01:08:18,204
l have the battery. l'm on a schedule.

901
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:21,106
The world is full of bad guys
and people are calling.

902
01:08:26,681 --> 01:08:27,909
l understand.

903
01:08:29,150 --> 01:08:30,948
What's your price?

904
01:08:32,654 --> 01:08:34,384
l have a figure in mind.

905
01:08:34,590 --> 01:08:36,454
What's it worth to you?

906
01:08:36,925 --> 01:08:39,792
Are you angry about your island, Roy?

907
01:08:39,994 --> 01:08:42,292
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, Tony.

908
01:08:55,476 --> 01:08:59,503
l'm lsabel George, Director
of Counter Espionage at the ClA.

909
01:09:00,448 --> 01:09:02,109
l'm sure you are.

910
01:09:04,052 --> 01:09:05,815
Forgive me, l just.. .

911
01:09:07,890 --> 01:09:10,154
l just don't know exactly what to believe.

912
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:15,956
Well, that's understandable,
considering that the last five days

913
01:09:16,064 --> 01:09:19,261
you've been fed a steady diet
of misinformation and fantasy

914
01:09:19,368 --> 01:09:22,462
by an agent of ours
who's recently gone rogue.

915
01:09:22,805 --> 01:09:26,502
Well, he said that Fitzgerald was the
one that wanted to steal the battery.

916
01:09:26,608 --> 01:09:28,131
Well, let's examine the facts.

917
01:09:28,377 --> 01:09:33,006
Miller told you that he was protecting the
Zephyr from people wanting to misuse it.

918
01:09:33,215 --> 01:09:36,377
But now he's trying to sell it
to an international arms dealer.

919
01:09:36,819 --> 01:09:38,411
Antonio Quintana.

920
01:09:38,886 --> 01:09:41,515
One of Europe's leading
weapons manufacturers.

921
01:09:42,490 --> 01:09:43,617
Ask yourself, Miss Havens,

922
01:09:46,494 --> 01:09:49,987
has Roy Miller said anything to you
that's proven to be true?

923
01:09:52,201 --> 01:09:54,293
<i>-God, excuse me.
-No, l'm sorry.</i>

924
01:09:59,006 --> 01:10:02,033
<i>Sorry, l was looking at my phone.
l hate it when people do that.</i>

925
01:10:04,546 --> 01:10:06,740
<i>Oh, my God, l'm so sorry.</i>

926
01:10:08,216 --> 01:10:11,208
<i>-This is getting to be a habit.
-Yeah, it is.</i>

927
01:10:12,688 --> 01:10:16,680
He used you as a mule to carry the battery
through security, Miss Havens.

928
01:10:17,426 --> 01:10:19,256
He's been playing you.

929
01:10:20,061 --> 01:10:22,962
He's a spy, that's what he does.
He lies for a living.

930
01:10:23,064 --> 01:10:26,228
Any love, empathy,
we train that right out of them.

931
01:10:26,435 --> 01:10:27,902
What did you imagine?

932
01:10:28,103 --> 01:10:31,300
The two of you would move
into a condo together, get a dog?

933
01:10:31,506 --> 01:10:34,533
You can't have a life with him.
That's fantasy.

934
01:10:35,243 --> 01:10:36,836
But you can have yours back.

935
01:10:37,212 --> 01:10:38,509
She's been gone eight minutes.

936
01:10:38,713 --> 01:10:41,649
We need you to get back to the hotel
before Miller.

937
01:10:44,019 --> 01:10:46,988
-What am l supposed to do?
-All right, then.

938
01:10:49,557 --> 01:10:51,252
This pen is a transmitter.

939
01:10:51,793 --> 01:10:54,354
Once you have confirmation
that Miller has not hidden the Zephyr,

940
01:10:54,462 --> 01:10:57,556
that it's somewhere nearby,
or on his person,

941
01:10:58,399 --> 01:11:01,836
you can confirm this
by simply clicking the top button.

942
01:11:11,279 --> 01:11:13,009
l'm sorry l'm late.

943
01:11:14,382 --> 01:11:16,078
Everything go okay?

944
01:11:18,953 --> 01:11:20,319
Well enough.

945
01:11:25,159 --> 01:11:26,286
lt's getting hotter.

946
01:11:37,238 --> 01:11:39,104
So, did you get your price?

947
01:11:43,612 --> 01:11:45,476
l followed you tonight.

948
01:11:50,252 --> 01:11:51,878
You have nothing to say?

949
01:11:53,020 --> 01:11:55,421
Here's to Wichita

950
01:11:58,226 --> 01:11:59,421
where we first.. .

951
01:12:00,295 --> 01:12:02,159
Bumped into each other.

952
01:12:05,766 --> 01:12:07,701
Do you think that was fate, Roy?

953
01:12:09,537 --> 01:12:11,471
l don't believe in fate.

954
01:12:12,474 --> 01:12:14,305
But l believe in luck.

955
01:12:16,878 --> 01:12:19,039
l don't know what to believe.

956
01:12:30,958 --> 01:12:33,654
That hurt more than l thought it would.

957
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:39,890
l'm going home.

958
01:12:50,612 --> 01:12:55,412
They promised that if you turned
yourself in, they'd protect you.

959
01:12:57,752 --> 01:12:59,515
l love your optimism.

960
01:13:00,889 --> 01:13:01,947
Never lose it.

961
01:13:09,430 --> 01:13:10,796
Get her out of here.

962
01:13:27,048 --> 01:13:28,743
He's not here, sir.

963
01:13:29,283 --> 01:13:31,774
Did they tell you you're going home?

964
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:34,518
You've seen the inside
of the honeycomb, June!

965
01:13:35,157 --> 01:13:36,418
You can't go home.

966
01:13:36,725 --> 01:13:38,783
<i>The suspect is on the roof.</i>

967
01:13:42,631 --> 01:13:43,619
Oh, shit.

968
01:14:02,484 --> 01:14:04,042
Director George!

969
01:14:04,586 --> 01:14:06,247
Get her in the car.

970
01:14:56,805 --> 01:14:58,363
He's heading toward the river.

971
01:15:12,453 --> 01:15:14,546
Stand down! He has the battery!

972
01:15:23,331 --> 01:15:25,162
Hey! Hey! Hold it!

973
01:15:25,367 --> 01:15:26,390
Hold your fire!

974
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:27,658
Stand down!

975
01:15:27,868 --> 01:15:28,836
He has the battery!

976
01:15:47,788 --> 01:15:49,416
Did you secure the kid?

977
01:15:50,292 --> 01:15:51,259
Yeah.

978
01:16:00,469 --> 01:16:01,595
Did they find Roy?

979
01:16:02,002 --> 01:16:04,563
We'll find the body. We have to.

980
01:16:04,939 --> 01:16:06,965
He went down with the Zephyr.

981
01:16:42,644 --> 01:16:43,804
Thank you, guys.

982
01:17:11,739 --> 01:17:13,002
Fitz?

983
01:17:13,108 --> 01:17:17,010
Fitz, l think we just made a wrong turn.
Ramstein is that way, west.

984
01:17:17,112 --> 01:17:18,841
l think we're going south.

985
01:17:19,046 --> 01:17:20,844
You know what? You're right.

986
01:17:29,224 --> 01:17:31,158
Tell him we're back on track.

987
01:17:31,359 --> 01:17:34,418
l don't have the battery,
but no one's gonna get it now.

988
01:17:34,628 --> 01:17:36,426
Yeah, l've got the next best thing.

989
01:17:36,698 --> 01:17:39,097
l'll see you in Spain in two days.

990
01:17:49,743 --> 01:17:51,041
Hey, Wilmer.

991
01:17:52,447 --> 01:17:54,243
-How was the party?
-lt was nice.

992
01:17:54,716 --> 01:17:57,047
-l see the goat is still out there.
-Yeah.

993
01:17:57,252 --> 01:17:58,912
l thought it was a wedding present.

994
01:17:59,119 --> 01:18:00,917
lt was, but,

995
01:18:02,990 --> 01:18:05,515
l think l wanted her to want it
more than she wanted it.

996
01:18:05,860 --> 01:18:06,850
Okay.

997
01:18:07,828 --> 01:18:11,525
<i>...Boston's classic rock station.
Here are the Kingsmen.</i>

998
01:18:11,733 --> 01:18:12,859
This just come in?

999
01:18:13,068 --> 01:18:15,797
G-body Grand Prix.
Longest hood in history.

1000
01:18:16,738 --> 01:18:18,466
Gonna be a real beaut.

1001
01:18:27,282 --> 01:18:30,809
Ru-pa.. . Fee-pa.. . No, it's.. .

1002
01:18:31,418 --> 01:18:34,286
5826 Amapola.

1003
01:18:36,957 --> 01:18:38,926
That's like an hour from here.

1004
01:18:39,761 --> 01:18:41,557
Maybe it's a safe-house.

1005
01:19:16,597 --> 01:19:17,929
Here we go.

1006
01:20:11,192 --> 01:20:12,250
Shit!

1007
01:20:15,262 --> 01:20:17,925
Who's out there?
l'm not afraid to use this.

1008
01:20:18,032 --> 01:20:19,590
Oh, Frank, look at her!

1009
01:20:19,867 --> 01:20:22,233
l want to know what she's doing
on my lawn in the middle of the night.

1010
01:20:22,436 --> 01:20:24,029
l.. . l have the pistons you ordered.

1011
01:20:24,238 --> 01:20:25,466
Pistons?

1012
01:20:25,672 --> 01:20:27,162
For the '67 Grand Prix.

1013
01:20:27,507 --> 01:20:29,100
Molly, l didn't.. .

1014
01:20:29,743 --> 01:20:32,144
You are all wet. Please, come inside.

1015
01:20:39,854 --> 01:20:42,652
That Pontiac you have out there, Frank,
is a real classic.

1016
01:20:44,057 --> 01:20:46,720
l really love pre-'70s Grand Prixs.

1017
01:20:48,029 --> 01:20:50,122
So, you two lived here long?

1018
01:20:50,731 --> 01:20:54,292
This old place?
lt's been our home for 40 years.

1019
01:20:54,969 --> 01:20:57,198
Sit down, honey. Have a cookie.

1020
01:20:58,305 --> 01:21:01,434
Frank thinks we should move,
but you know what? l am comfortable.

1021
01:21:01,676 --> 01:21:05,077
And we can afford to stay,
thanks to Publishers Clearing House.

1022
01:21:08,216 --> 01:21:09,739
You won Publishers Clearing House?

1023
01:21:09,850 --> 01:21:13,252
-Twice.
-Plus, we won two lotto quick picks

1024
01:21:13,354 --> 01:21:15,845
-Frank doesn't even remember buying.
-Because l didn't buy them.

1025
01:21:15,957 --> 01:21:18,983
Oh, yeah, like you didn't order pistons
off the lnternet.

1026
01:21:19,426 --> 01:21:23,090
You don't know what you're typing
into that computer, Frank.

1027
01:21:23,398 --> 01:21:26,492
Another couple of minutes
on your clothes, honey.

1028
01:21:28,036 --> 01:21:29,002
So,

1029
01:21:31,372 --> 01:21:32,703
Roy Miller.

1030
01:21:34,475 --> 01:21:36,704
This was one of his safe-houses,
wasn't it?

1031
01:21:40,414 --> 01:21:41,779
What in the hell are you talking about?

1032
01:21:44,152 --> 01:21:45,448
Honey, what's this all about?

1033
01:21:48,588 --> 01:21:51,581
l'm sorry, l just thought, maybe.. .

1034
01:21:51,792 --> 01:21:53,623
l must've had this all wrong.

1035
01:21:53,994 --> 01:21:58,261
l was just looking for some information
about my friend, Roy.

1036
01:22:00,033 --> 01:22:03,435
lf you'd like to change,
there's a powder room right there.

1037
01:22:14,614 --> 01:22:16,445
That's our son, Matthew.

1038
01:22:16,650 --> 01:22:19,643
We lost him in Kuwait.
There was a chopper crash.

1039
01:22:19,854 --> 01:22:22,981
He saved the lives
of two of his crewmen, and.. .

1040
01:22:24,391 --> 01:22:26,019
He just always took care of everyone.

1041
01:22:26,226 --> 01:22:27,751
He was an Eagle Scout.

1042
01:22:27,862 --> 01:22:31,161
This was taken the day
he got that swimming badge.

1043
01:22:31,364 --> 01:22:34,595
He could swim clear across Lake Sunapee

1044
01:22:34,801 --> 01:22:36,860
with practically one breath.

1045
01:22:39,239 --> 01:22:40,707
l just.. .

1046
01:22:41,842 --> 01:22:44,208
l've been terribly rude.

1047
01:22:44,845 --> 01:22:46,609
l'm June Havens.

1048
01:22:46,980 --> 01:22:48,413
Molly Knight.

1049
01:22:49,382 --> 01:22:52,078
This is June Havens, and l'm leaving
a message on my own machine

1050
01:22:52,185 --> 01:22:54,847
for whoever is listening to this phone call.

1051
01:22:55,155 --> 01:22:56,783
l have the Zephyr.

1052
01:22:57,257 --> 01:22:59,988
l have the Zephyr,
and l'm ready to make a deal.

1053
01:23:01,395 --> 01:23:05,832
l'm sitting on Route 28,
right outside New Hampshire.

1054
01:23:06,533 --> 01:23:08,229
And if you want the Zephyr,

1055
01:23:08,502 --> 01:23:10,470
you better come and get it.

1056
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:47,106
Hey, fellas.

1057
01:23:52,747 --> 01:23:53,872
So,

1058
01:23:54,448 --> 01:23:56,176
you want the Zephyr?

1059
01:23:56,884 --> 01:23:59,250
l got the Zephyr. lt's right here.

1060
01:23:59,453 --> 01:24:00,818
Come and get it.

1061
01:24:18,206 --> 01:24:21,231
Come on. Let's go!

1062
01:24:22,009 --> 01:24:23,100
<i>Welcome to España.</i>

1063
01:24:34,387 --> 01:24:36,981
Today is the festival of San Fermin.

1064
01:24:39,827 --> 01:24:42,694
Have you ever seen a bullfight,
Miss Havens?

1065
01:24:48,935 --> 01:24:50,664
My name is Antonio Quintana.

1066
01:24:51,738 --> 01:24:53,399
l know who you are.

1067
01:24:55,710 --> 01:24:57,301
What did he give me?

1068
01:24:58,212 --> 01:25:00,407
lt's something we're developing
at my company.

1069
01:25:00,514 --> 01:25:02,345
A new kind of truth serum.

1070
01:25:02,682 --> 01:25:03,809
Really?

1071
01:25:06,087 --> 01:25:08,680
l have a few questions for you
about the battery,

1072
01:25:08,788 --> 01:25:12,122
since we both know
what you gave to my men was a joke.

1073
01:25:16,197 --> 01:25:18,028
l don't like you very much.

1074
01:25:20,301 --> 01:25:21,324
The truth!

1075
01:25:24,005 --> 01:25:25,063
Good!

1076
01:25:27,774 --> 01:25:30,403
You know, l really like Miller, though.

1077
01:25:30,610 --> 01:25:33,603
'Cause, you know, l was totally wrong
about him in Salzburg.

1078
01:25:33,814 --> 01:25:36,338
He wanted me to hear that phone call
so that l would follow him.

1079
01:25:36,449 --> 01:25:38,917
l'd turn him in,
and then he could get me home safely.

1080
01:25:39,020 --> 01:25:40,350
He was trying to protect me.

1081
01:25:40,453 --> 01:25:41,613
Shut up.

1082
01:25:41,956 --> 01:25:46,051
lt's crazy that l could feel
so powerful and capable around him.. .

1083
01:25:46,159 --> 01:25:49,220
-Shut up.
-.. and yet he takes care of me.

1084
01:25:49,430 --> 01:25:52,194
Shut up! Where is the battery?
Where is it?

1085
01:25:53,734 --> 01:25:56,532
l bet you've never made a girl
an omelet, have you, Antonio?

1086
01:25:59,907 --> 01:26:01,100
Don't test me, June.

1087
01:26:01,309 --> 01:26:03,708
Or got her to her sister's wedding
on time.

1088
01:26:03,810 --> 01:26:05,801
lt's really the little things, honestly.

1089
01:26:06,012 --> 01:26:08,003
-But they count so much.
-Enough!

1090
01:26:08,515 --> 01:26:09,539
Okay!

1091
01:26:09,850 --> 01:26:12,318
Miller is dead!
Roy Miller is dead, he's out.

1092
01:26:13,787 --> 01:26:14,845
No.

1093
01:26:15,155 --> 01:26:18,319
No, he's not. He can hold his breath
for a really long time.

1094
01:26:19,894 --> 01:26:20,952
He is dead!

1095
01:26:58,164 --> 01:27:02,658
l'm not gonna ask you again. But if
you don't tell me what l need to know,

1096
01:27:04,070 --> 01:27:06,265
-you're gonna die!
-l don't know where the battery is.

1097
01:27:06,373 --> 01:27:08,171
Then why did you tell everyone
you had it? Why?

1098
01:27:08,274 --> 01:27:10,243
Because l was trying to find Roy.

1099
01:27:13,247 --> 01:27:18,149
Well, Antonio, whenever there's bad guys
like you around, Roy's not too far away.

1100
01:27:22,323 --> 01:27:23,881
You're gonna die.

1101
01:27:35,269 --> 01:27:36,462
Finally!

1102
01:27:37,971 --> 01:27:40,405
Nice to meet you, John.

1103
01:27:40,608 --> 01:27:41,631
Antonio.

1104
01:27:42,143 --> 01:27:43,734
Too bad you couldn't get the battery.

1105
01:27:46,313 --> 01:27:47,779
Where is the boy?

1106
01:27:50,684 --> 01:27:53,118
You didn't think
l'd just bring the package, did you?

1107
01:27:53,453 --> 01:27:54,751
Come on.

1108
01:27:55,756 --> 01:27:58,350
Why don't you follow me down
to the river and bring the money?

1109
01:27:58,458 --> 01:27:59,516
Okay.

1110
01:28:32,827 --> 01:28:36,489
ls this thatching in here? Because l've
never seen anything like that before.

1111
01:28:36,596 --> 01:28:40,260
We have really old architecture
in Boston, but nothing like this.

1112
01:28:40,367 --> 01:28:42,596
You're really lucky, because this place is.. .

1113
01:28:43,037 --> 01:28:46,199
Let me tell you.
You're really lucky, it's beautiful here.

1114
01:28:46,841 --> 01:28:48,239
My thoughts are so clear.

1115
01:28:49,609 --> 01:28:52,443
ls this all weapons money,
or is this family money?

1116
01:28:54,148 --> 01:28:56,912
Gardens! He likes gardens, huh?

1117
01:28:57,150 --> 01:28:59,085
Do you guys ever do any gardening?

1118
01:28:59,185 --> 01:29:02,019
lt's really relaxing.
lt's amazing how much you can just.. .

1119
01:29:02,122 --> 01:29:05,649
This really is a happy place.
Look at these trumpet flowers. They.. .

1120
01:29:05,759 --> 01:29:07,521
Okay, Eduardo,
you don't have to pull me around.

1121
01:29:07,627 --> 01:29:09,858
You can just tell me
where you want me to go, okay?

1122
01:29:09,963 --> 01:29:12,728
-This way, blondie.
-See? Now we're communicating.

1123
01:29:14,301 --> 01:29:16,701
l bet you're taking me someplace
safe and secure.

1124
01:29:16,804 --> 01:29:18,795
Someplace special.
Antonio's special place.

1125
01:29:18,939 --> 01:29:20,872
Antonio has a special place?
That's so nice.

1126
01:29:20,975 --> 01:29:22,533
Everyone should have a special place.

1127
01:29:31,952 --> 01:29:34,681
-Luis?
-ls there a problem, Eduardo?

1128
01:29:41,261 --> 01:29:44,253
-Hi, Roy.
-Hi, June. You're supposed to be home.

1129
01:29:44,364 --> 01:29:46,525
-You're supposed to be dead.
-l can explain.

1130
01:29:46,634 --> 01:29:48,430
-You don't have to.
-l came here to get Simon.

1131
01:29:48,536 --> 01:29:51,333
-l just, you know, caught up with him.
-That's cool.

1132
01:29:56,577 --> 01:29:58,703
His name is Eduardo. Eduardo.

1133
01:30:01,582 --> 01:30:03,277
l need you to listen,
because when you wake up,

1134
01:30:03,384 --> 01:30:05,318
you're gonna call your boss
and you're gonna tell him

1135
01:30:05,418 --> 01:30:08,444
that Roy Miller, that's me,
has the battery and escaped with the girl.

1136
01:30:08,555 --> 01:30:10,113
-You have the battery?
-Yeah.

1137
01:30:10,557 --> 01:30:13,118
You tell him l'm coming for him.

1138
01:30:14,161 --> 01:30:15,149
-Yes.
-Okay.

1139
01:30:16,229 --> 01:30:17,219
Let's go.

1140
01:30:17,797 --> 01:30:20,664
l'm worried about Simon.
l haven't seen him.

1141
01:30:20,935 --> 01:30:22,903
My tracker has been spotty.

1142
01:30:23,002 --> 01:30:25,698
Life with you is so exciting.
You excite me, Miller.

1143
01:30:25,805 --> 01:30:26,966
l took too long to get here.

1144
01:30:27,073 --> 01:30:28,336
-7:00.
-What?

1145
01:30:28,442 --> 01:30:29,601
7:00.

1146
01:30:38,551 --> 01:30:40,815
l think l feel like having sex.

1147
01:30:42,855 --> 01:30:44,483
l think we'd have really great sex.

1148
01:30:46,159 --> 01:30:47,127
Did they give you something?

1149
01:30:49,063 --> 01:30:50,324
You should hydrate.

1150
01:30:51,631 --> 01:30:52,621
Roy?

1151
01:30:58,905 --> 01:30:59,930
Roy.

1152
01:31:05,145 --> 01:31:06,112
Roy?

1153
01:31:06,579 --> 01:31:07,637
June.

1154
01:31:13,787 --> 01:31:14,753
June?

1155
01:31:16,422 --> 01:31:18,220
You don't seem
very happy to see me, Roy.

1156
01:31:20,860 --> 01:31:21,850
What?

1157
01:31:22,662 --> 01:31:23,856
Not really.

1158
01:31:43,449 --> 01:31:44,712
l am happy.

1159
01:31:53,726 --> 01:31:55,694
-So the red dot is us?
-No, we're yellow.

1160
01:31:55,796 --> 01:31:57,161
The red dot is Simon.

1161
01:31:57,730 --> 01:32:00,359
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1162
01:32:14,914 --> 01:32:16,279
-Air time.
-Air time?

1163
01:32:35,569 --> 01:32:38,935
He says his name is Roy Miller.
He says he has the battery.

1164
01:32:45,145 --> 01:32:46,203
Miller is here.

1165
01:32:49,416 --> 01:32:50,609
There he is!

1166
01:32:51,118 --> 01:32:52,448
There he is!

1167
01:32:53,953 --> 01:32:55,716
This way. Follow me!

1168
01:33:08,101 --> 01:33:09,126
Bulls?

1169
01:33:25,685 --> 01:33:27,414
-There's Fitz!
-l see him.

1170
01:34:19,139 --> 01:34:20,935
-Take the guns.
-Okay.

1171
01:34:22,509 --> 01:34:23,998
Here.

1172
01:34:24,478 --> 01:34:26,639
-What next?
-Let them have it.

1173
01:34:50,671 --> 01:34:53,400
June Havens, you've got skills.

1174
01:34:55,842 --> 01:34:57,037
Let's go!

1175
01:35:10,423 --> 01:35:11,412
Go.

1176
01:35:35,882 --> 01:35:37,407
-See you down there.
-Are you sure?

1177
01:35:37,516 --> 01:35:38,609
No.

1178
01:35:43,489 --> 01:35:44,615
Sorry.

1179
01:35:47,994 --> 01:35:49,519
-Get up.
-Okay.

1180
01:35:59,206 --> 01:36:00,570
Freeze right there, Roy!

1181
01:36:00,673 --> 01:36:01,698
Hey, Simon.

1182
01:36:01,807 --> 01:36:03,207
Get down on your knees, now!

1183
01:36:03,310 --> 01:36:04,800
-Roy!
-Now! Now!

1184
01:36:05,345 --> 01:36:06,676
Put them in the water. ln the water.

1185
01:36:07,847 --> 01:36:09,212
l just want the kid, Fitz.

1186
01:36:10,951 --> 01:36:11,975
Okay.

1187
01:36:12,085 --> 01:36:14,712
Well, l hope you brought what l want,
otherwise l'm gonna have to kill him.

1188
01:36:14,820 --> 01:36:16,811
And l swear to you, l'll do it.

1189
01:36:17,157 --> 01:36:19,989
l believe you. Just like Wichita.

1190
01:36:20,359 --> 01:36:22,328
-l understand.
-Okay.

1191
01:36:22,496 --> 01:36:23,827
l'm just gonna get the battery.

1192
01:36:24,131 --> 01:36:25,757
-lt's right here.
-Don't give it to him, Roy.

1193
01:36:25,865 --> 01:36:27,332
Please don't give it to him. No, no.

1194
01:36:27,434 --> 01:36:28,594
Roy, Roy, please don't give it to him.

1195
01:36:29,970 --> 01:36:31,266
Put it on the deck.

1196
01:36:31,371 --> 01:36:33,532
-Roy, Roy, please don't give it to him !
-Easy, easy.

1197
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:34,731
Simon, it's okay.

1198
01:36:34,841 --> 01:36:36,001
Roy, don't give it to him !

1199
01:36:36,109 --> 01:36:38,838
-Shut it! Stop it! Shut it!
-Roy!

1200
01:36:45,819 --> 01:36:48,014
Okay. Okay, l'll make another one.

1201
01:36:48,121 --> 01:36:49,349
-You don't understand.
-Simon, don't talk.

1202
01:36:49,456 --> 01:36:52,515
-l'll just make another one.
-Make another one?

1203
01:37:10,077 --> 01:37:11,510
Am l dying?

1204
01:37:12,813 --> 01:37:14,144
No, you fainted.

1205
01:37:15,614 --> 01:37:17,775
-l'm sorry.
-No, that's okay.

1206
01:37:17,884 --> 01:37:19,943
No, no. l've been trying to tell you.. .

1207
01:37:24,757 --> 01:37:26,225
Why is it hot?

1208
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:28,954
Because it's filled with power.

1209
01:37:29,296 --> 01:37:32,025
The battery.. . l messed up.
lt's deteriorating.

1210
01:37:32,131 --> 01:37:33,997
l know. lt's unstable.

1211
01:37:45,679 --> 01:37:49,206
You're a smart guy, Simon.
l know you'll figure it out.

1212
01:37:54,087 --> 01:37:55,076
Oh, my glasses. Thank you.

1213
01:37:56,789 --> 01:37:57,814
Roy,

1214
01:37:57,923 --> 01:37:59,255
you're shot.

1215
01:38:01,595 --> 01:38:02,856
Get help.

1216
01:38:11,805 --> 01:38:12,828
Roy.

1217
01:38:18,278 --> 01:38:20,472
You're beautiful, June Havens.

1218
01:38:32,692 --> 01:38:35,592
Stay with me. Roy, look at me.

1219
01:38:36,863 --> 01:38:37,954
Stay with me.

1220
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:44,631
We're here now, Miller.
We got you. We got you.

1221
01:38:47,407 --> 01:38:48,930
-Charge at 360.
-June.

1222
01:38:49,042 --> 01:38:50,167
Clear!

1223
01:39:15,167 --> 01:39:18,228
lt's been a spectacular
couple of weeks, Miller.

1224
01:39:21,041 --> 01:39:23,202
lt's good to see you, lsabel.

1225
01:39:26,179 --> 01:39:27,145
Hi, guys.

1226
01:39:28,648 --> 01:39:30,479
You cleaned house, Roy.

1227
01:39:32,118 --> 01:39:34,279
l have to thank you for that.

1228
01:39:35,689 --> 01:39:37,554
l trusted the wrong man.

1229
01:39:38,225 --> 01:39:39,555
lt happens.

1230
01:39:42,229 --> 01:39:45,460
Simon's happy. He's got a new lab.

1231
01:39:47,501 --> 01:39:48,467
Where is June?

1232
01:39:49,636 --> 01:39:51,194
l sent her home.

1233
01:39:54,440 --> 01:39:55,738
She gets it.

1234
01:39:57,543 --> 01:40:00,104
She knows you two lead different lives
and she's moving on.

1235
01:40:00,613 --> 01:40:02,046
As should you.

1236
01:40:05,284 --> 01:40:07,149
You gave up those things.

1237
01:40:07,253 --> 01:40:11,020
You let go of who you were.
Family, friends, that's the deal.

1238
01:40:12,292 --> 01:40:14,088
Why are we still talking about this?

1239
01:40:14,627 --> 01:40:16,618
Because the agency invested a lot in you.

1240
01:40:16,930 --> 01:40:20,296
And you're an asset
only as long as you stay focused.

1241
01:40:29,275 --> 01:40:30,243
You look good.

1242
01:40:31,778 --> 01:40:33,176
Get some rest.

1243
01:40:33,279 --> 01:40:37,511
We got to transfer you to a secure facility
tomorrow. For your safety.

1244
01:41:05,145 --> 01:41:07,806
Nurse? What.. . What did you give me?

1245
01:41:09,783 --> 01:41:11,045
Brotine-zero.

1246
01:41:23,930 --> 01:41:25,055
Stay under there, Roy.

1247
01:41:26,533 --> 01:41:27,591
You're dead.

1248
01:41:30,737 --> 01:41:32,261
Make way, please.

1249
01:41:32,905 --> 01:41:34,463
Going to the mortuary.

1250
01:41:40,012 --> 01:41:42,675
Don't worry, Roy. l got this.

1251
01:41:43,783 --> 01:41:45,751
lt's time for a vacation.

1252
01:41:49,588 --> 01:41:50,920
<i>Ride like the wind</i>

1253
01:41:53,592 --> 01:41:55,025
<i>And l've got</i>

1254
01:41:56,796 --> 01:42:00,960
<i>Such a long way to go
To make it to the border of Mexico</i>

1255
01:42:45,078 --> 01:42:46,978
Hey, there, sleepy head.

1256
01:42:49,748 --> 01:42:50,976
What day is it?

1257
01:42:52,152 --> 01:42:53,345
Someday.

1258
01:42:55,087 --> 01:42:56,520
Someday, Roy.

1259
01:43:05,998 --> 01:43:07,626
What am l wearing?

1260
01:43:10,170 --> 01:43:11,194
A pair of shorts.

1261
01:43:13,305 --> 01:43:15,001
How did l get into shorts?

1262
01:43:16,876 --> 01:43:19,503
Roy, l've been trained to rebuild
a six-speed transmission

1263
01:43:19,612 --> 01:43:22,444
with nothing but a pair of pliers
and a crescent wrench.

1264
01:43:23,382 --> 01:43:25,976
l think l can get you into a pair
of shorts without looking.

1265
01:43:27,886 --> 01:43:29,684
l'm not saying that's what l did.

1266
01:43:31,224 --> 01:43:33,248
You're both the navigator and the DJ.

1267
01:43:33,359 --> 01:43:35,793
And we have a long way to go
to Cape Horn.

1268
01:43:38,064 --> 01:43:41,363
With me, without me. With me,

1269
01:43:43,302 --> 01:43:44,634
without me.

1270
01:43:45,471 --> 01:43:46,496
With you.

1271
01:43:46,605 --> 01:43:49,096
Put some tunes on the radio, Mr. DJ.

1272
01:43:50,042 --> 01:43:51,032
Yes, ma'am.

1273
01:44:17,136 --> 01:44:18,434
Oh, my God, Frank.

1274
01:44:18,537 --> 01:44:21,029
What is this envelope
with tickets to Cape Horn?

1275
01:44:21,140 --> 01:44:22,198
What are you talking about?

1276
01:44:22,307 --> 01:44:24,775
Did you order tickets to South America?

1277
01:44:24,877 --> 01:44:27,243
Molly, l didn't order tickets to anywhere.

1278
01:44:27,346 --> 01:44:29,837
You don't know what you're typing
on that computer, Frank.

1279
01:44:29,948 --> 01:44:31,814
-Molly.. .
-Then, we must've won them !

1280
01:44:31,917 --> 01:44:34,011
<i>-Molly...
-Well, we're going, aren't we?</i>
