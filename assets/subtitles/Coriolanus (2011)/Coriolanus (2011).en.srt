Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.

8
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:35,999
You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?

9
00:02:36,454 --> 00:02:37,427
Resolved. resolved.

10
00:02:38,398 --> 00:02:41,107
First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.

11
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:43,659
We know't, we know't.

12
00:02:44,834 --> 00:02:45,550
Let us kill him,

13
00:02:48,182 --> 00:02:50,199
and we'll have corn at our own price.

14
00:02:50,381 --> 00:02:53,756
We are accounted poor citizens,the patricians good.

15
00:02:55,422 --> 00:02:59,318
the leanness that afflicts us, the object of our misery;

16
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,812
our sufferance is a gain to them .

17
00:03:03,398 --> 00:03:06,429
Let us revenge this with our sticks and we become rakes.

Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always loved
the people.

22
00:03:17,345 --> 00:03:21,260
I tell you, friends, most charitable care
Have the patricians of you.

23
00:03:22,205 --> 00:03:24,297
For your wants,
Your suffering in this dearth,

24
00:03:24,297 --> 00:03:27,112

25
00:03:27,711 --> 00:03:29,954
as lift them
Against the Roman state,

26
00:03:30,328 --> 00:03:33,666

What's the matter,

34
00:05:44,045 --> 00:05:47,302
you dissentious rogues,That, rubbing the
poor itch of your opinion,

35
00:05:47,312 --> 00:05:49,197
Make yourselves scabs?

36
00:05:49,862 --> 00:05:51,566
We have ever your good word.

37
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,294
He that will give good words to thee will flatter

38

Beneath abhorring.

39
00:05:57,462 --> 00:05:59,406
What would you have, you curs,

40
00:05:59,554 --> 00:06:02,981
That like nor peace nor war?
the one affrights you,

41
00:06:03,285 --> 00:06:04,967
The other makes you proud.

42
00:06:05,313 --> 00:06:06,329
He that trusts to you,

43
00:06:06,549 --> 00:06:09,014
Where he should find you lions,
finds you hares;

44
00:06:09,517 --> 00:06:11,540
Where foxes, geese .

45
00:06:13,046 --> 00:06:18,068
Who deserves greatness,
Deserves your hate;

46
00:06:19,043 --> 00:06:20,043
Hang ye! Trust Ye?

47
00:06:20,337 --> 00:06:23,777
With every minute you do change a mind,

48
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,293
And call him noble that was now your hate,

49
00:06:26,394 --> 00:06:29,665
Him vile that was your garland.
What's the matter,

50
00:06:29,792 --> 00:06:32,487
That in these several places of the city

51
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,215
You cry against the noble senate,
who, under the gods, keep you in awe,

52
00:06:37,032 --> 00:06:39,099
which else would feed on one another?

53
00:06:41,996 --> 00:06:42,465
Go !

54
00:06:43,398 --> 00:06:45,077
Get your home ,

55
00:06:46,846 --> 00:06:48,575
you fragments!

56
00:07:12,852 --> 00:07:14,852
Stand back!

60
00:08:10,048 --> 00:08:10,648
Please .

61
00:08:11,161 --> 00:08:12,241
know you me yet?

62
00:08:14,325 --> 00:08:17,866
I know you well,

63
00:08:19,001 --> 00:08:20,291
your name, I think, is  Aufidius.

64
00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:23,263
It is so .

65
00:08:25,007 --> 00:08:26,120
I am a Roman .

66
00:08:27,252 --> 00:08:28,352
What's the news in Rome?

67
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:42,254
What's the news in Rome?

68
00:08:43,234 --> 00:08:45,883
There hath been in Rome strange insurrections;

69
00:08:47,498 --> 00:08:49,642
the people against the senators, patricians, and nobles.

70
00:08:49,723 --> 00:08:50,723
Hath been!

71
00:08:51,725 --> 00:08:54,845
-  is it ended, then?
- The main blaze of it is past,

72
00:08:55,329 --> 00:08:57,464
but a small thing
would make it flame again

73
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:00,685
you have ended my business .

74
00:09:10,033 --> 00:09:12,879
Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us;
The Volsces are in arms.

75
00:09:13,022 --> 00:09:15,729
They have a leader,Tullus Aufidius,

76
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:17,539
that will put you to 't.

77
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:20,579
I sin in envying his nobility,

78
00:09:21,981 --> 00:09:25,106
And were I any thing but what I am,
I would wish me only he.

79
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,470
You have fought together.

80
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:30,026
he is a lion that I am proud to hunt.

81
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:35,560
Titus Lartius, thou
Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face

82
00:09:37,658 --> 00:09:39,098
Lead you on.

83
00:09:54,599 --> 00:09:56,775
So, your opinion is, Aufidius,

84
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:59,455
That they of Rome are entered in our counsels ...

85
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,168
- And know how we proceed.
- Is it not yours?

86
00:10:02,396 --> 00:10:04,839
'Tis not four days gone
Since I heard thence;

87
00:10:05,584 --> 00:10:08,592
By the discovery
We shall be shorten'd in our aim .

88
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:13,000
and it is rumour'd, Marcius your old enemy,
lead on this preparation .

89
00:10:13,151 --> 00:10:15,127
If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,

90
00:10:15,376 --> 00:10:18,916
'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
Till one can do no more.

91
00:10:20,355 --> 00:10:23,036
If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,

92
00:10:23,403 --> 00:10:26,585
He's mine, or I am his

93
00:10:34,514 --> 00:10:35,514
Volscian city of Corioles

94
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,716
He that retires I'll take him for a Volsce,
And he shall feel mine edge.

95
00:11:15,236 --> 00:11:16,136
Go!

96
00:12:38,615 --> 00:12:42,430
The citizens of Corioli have issued,
And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle.

97
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:47,019
I saw our party to their trenches driven,
And then I came away.

98
00:12:50,272 --> 00:12:53,152
I pray you, daughter, sing;

99
00:12:54,601 --> 00:12:57,206
or express yourself in a
more comfortable sort.

100
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,798
if my son were my husband,

101
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:05,867
I'm more free with rejoice in that absence

102
00:13:06,561 --> 00:13:07,561
wherein he won honour...

103
00:13:08,033 --> 00:13:11,433
than in the embracements of his bed
where he would show most love.

104
00:13:12,172 --> 00:13:14,518
When yet he was but tender-bodied

105
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:16,461
and the only son of my womb,

106
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,854
I, considering how honour would become such a person.

107
00:13:21,251 --> 00:13:23,450
was pleased to let him seek danger ,

108
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:25,780
where he was like to find fame.

109
00:13:27,597 --> 00:13:31,307
To a cruel war I sent him;
from whence he returned,

110
00:13:32,018 --> 00:13:33,929
his brows bound with oak.

111
00:13:34,295 --> 00:13:36,439
But had he died in the business, madam; how then?

112
00:13:37,297 --> 00:13:38,007
Then ...

113
00:13:40,189 --> 00:13:42,366
his good report should have been my son;

114
00:13:45,262 --> 00:13:46,442
Hear me .

115
00:13:48,832 --> 00:13:50,131
had I a dozen sons,

116
00:13:51,702 --> 00:13:54,091
I had rather had eleven die

117
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,360
nobly for their country

118
00:13:57,156 --> 00:13:59,913
than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.

119
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,513
Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!

120
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,774
He'll beat Aufidius 'head below his knee
And tread upon his neck

121
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,858
Methinks I hear ...

122
00:14:10,993 --> 00:14:12,580
hither your husband's drum,

123
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:18,521
Methinks I see him stamp

124
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:22,585
thus, and call thus

125
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,691
'Come on, you cowards!

126
00:14:27,555 --> 00:14:30,746
you were got in fear,
Though you were born in Rome'

127
00:14:35,005 --> 00:14:37,295
You souls of geese,

128
00:14:37,931 --> 00:14:39,673
That bear the shapes of men,

129
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,352
Pluto and hell!
look to't, come on .

130
00:14:45,414 --> 00:14:48,239
Mend and charge home,

131
00:14:48,911 --> 00:14:51,391
Or, by the fires of heaven,
I'll leave the foe

132
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:53,514
And make my wars on you

133
00:15:03,824 --> 00:15:06,998
his bloody brow
With his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,

134
00:15:07,118 --> 00:15:09,576
His bloody brow!
O Jupiter, no blood!

135
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:11,712
Away, you fool!

136
00:15:12,054 --> 00:15:14,791
it more becomes a man
Than gilt his trophy

137
00:15:14,911 --> 00:15:16,744
The Senator Valeria is come to visit you.

138
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,956
Tell Valeria,We are fit to bid her welcome.

139
00:15:19,076 --> 00:15:22,233
- Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.
- Indeed, you shall not.

140
00:15:22,353 --> 00:15:26,576
My ladies both, good day to you.

141
00:15:27,665 --> 00:15:29,701
How do you both?

142
00:15:29,821 --> 00:15:32,327
How does your little son?

143
00:15:32,534 --> 00:15:33,711
Thank you,so well good .

144
00:15:33,831 --> 00:15:37,428
He had rather see the swords, and hear a drum, than
look upon his school-master.

145
00:15:37,548 --> 00:15:38,875
O' my word, the father's son

146
00:15:40,681 --> 00:15:44,824
Come,  I must have you play
the idle husewife with me this afternoon.

147
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,781
- No signore, non voglio uscire.
- No , I will not out of doors.

148
00:15:47,901 --> 00:15:50,459
- She shall, she shall.
-Indeed, no, by your patience

149
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:53,486
I'll not over the threshold till my lord return from the wars.

150
00:15:53,606 --> 00:15:55,979
Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably

151
00:15:56,099 --> 00:15:57,648
I cannot go thither.

152
00:15:57,768 --> 00:15:59,667
You would be another Penelope

153
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,465
yet, they say, all the yarn she spun in

154
00:16:03,585 --> 00:16:05,586
Ulysses' absence did but fill
Ithaca full of moths.

155
00:16:08,132 --> 00:16:11,382
No, pardon me,indeed, I will not forth

156
00:16:11,502 --> 00:16:15,152
go with me and I'll tell you
excellent news of your husband.

157
00:16:15,272 --> 00:16:18,382
- Ma e' troppo presto per averne.
- there came news from him last night.

158
00:16:18,502 --> 00:16:19,330
Indeed ?

159
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:22,819
your lord and Titus Lartius are set
down before their city Corioli

160
00:16:22,939 --> 00:16:26,458
they nothing doubt
prevailing and to make it brief wars.

161
00:16:26,826 --> 00:16:31,484
This is true, on mine honour
and so, I pray, go out with us.

162
00:16:31,737 --> 00:16:35,876
Give me excuse, But it's Ah... I will obey you in every
thing hereafter.

163
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:39,314
Let her alone, as she is now, she will but
disease our better mirth.

164
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,435
<i>What is become of Marcius?</i>

165
00:18:30,555 --> 00:18:32,772
Slain, sir, doubtless.

166
00:18:33,005 --> 00:18:35,609
he is himself alone,
To answer all the city.

167
00:18:37,361 --> 00:18:40,486
Thou art left, Marcius

168
00:19:00,035 --> 00:19:03,581
Who's yonder,that does
appear as he were flay'd?

169
00:19:04,652 --> 00:19:07,510
O gods, he has the stamp of Marcius

170
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,287
Come I too late?

171
00:19:10,895 --> 00:19:12,438
Come I too late?

172
00:19:12,664 --> 00:19:15,818
Ay, if you come not in the blood of others,
But mantled in your own.

173
00:19:18,605 --> 00:19:21,589
O, let me clip ye
In arms as sound as when I woo'd,

174
00:19:21,709 --> 00:19:24,420
in heart as merry as when our nuptial day was done

175
00:19:25,174 --> 00:19:27,302
There is the man of my soul's hate,

176
00:19:27,422 --> 00:19:29,388
Aufidius, Piercing my Romans .

177
00:19:29,508 --> 00:19:31,524
Worthy sir, thou bleed'st.

178
00:19:31,644 --> 00:19:34,128
Thy exercise hath been too violent for
A second course of fight.

179
00:19:34,248 --> 00:19:37,021
Sir, praise me not;
My work hath yet not warm'd me

180
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:40,467
The blood I drop is rather physical
Than dangerous to me

181
00:19:40,587 --> 00:19:42,885
to Aufidius thus
I will appear, and fight.

182
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:48,382
If any such be here--
As it were sin to doubt

183
00:19:48,502 --> 00:19:51,512
that love this painting
Wherein you see me smear'd

184
00:19:51,632 --> 00:19:54,284
if any fear Lesser his person than an ill report

185
00:19:54,404 --> 00:19:57,605
If any think brave death outweighs bad life

186
00:19:57,725 --> 00:20:01,662
And that his country's dearer than himself
Let him alone,

187
00:20:01,939 --> 00:20:06,178
or so many so minded,
Wave thus, to express his disposition,

188
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:08,364
And follow Marcius !

189
00:20:13,449 --> 00:20:14,751
O, me alone!

190
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:26,009
make you a sword of me .

191
00:20:46,967 --> 00:20:48,836
<i>Avanza, valoroso Tito!</i>

192
00:20:59,214 --> 00:21:00,357
Away !

193
00:21:15,378 --> 00:21:16,922
- Come !
- Come!

194
00:21:47,561 --> 00:21:50,156
I'll fight with none but thee

195
00:21:50,915 --> 00:21:52,918
for I do hate thee

196
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:54,528
We hate alike

197
00:25:11,148 --> 00:25:14,278
Five times, Marcius,
I have fought with thee

198
00:25:16,623 --> 00:25:18,684
so often hast thou beat me,

199
00:25:19,155 --> 00:25:23,194
And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter
As often as we eat.

200
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:28,730
for where I thought to crush him in an equal force,

201
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:31,292
True sword to sword,

202
00:25:31,412 --> 00:25:33,532
I'll potch at him some way

203
00:25:33,652 --> 00:25:36,496
Or wrath or craft may get him.

204
00:25:36,616 --> 00:25:37,939
He's the devil.

205
00:25:38,462 --> 00:25:41,608
Bolder, though not so subtle.

206
00:25:44,845 --> 00:25:47,991
nor sleep nor sanctuary,

207
00:25:48,111 --> 00:25:50,979
Being naked, sick,

208
00:25:51,099 --> 00:25:53,701
The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,

209
00:25:53,821 --> 00:25:58,596
shall lift up their rotten privilege
and custom 'gainst my hate to Marcius

210
00:26:01,354 --> 00:26:02,940
where I find him,

211
00:26:04,367 --> 00:26:07,671
were it at home, upon my brother's guard,

212
00:26:08,831 --> 00:26:10,107
even there,

213
00:26:11,367 --> 00:26:14,205
would I wash my fierce hand in's heart.

214
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:18,377
Honourable Menenius !

215
00:26:19,675 --> 00:26:21,870
my boy Marcius approaches;

216
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,868
for the love of Juno, let's go.

217
00:26:23,988 --> 00:26:26,290
Is he not wounded?
he was wont to come home wounded.

218
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:29,464
O, yes, he is wounded; I thank the gods for't.

219
00:26:29,584 --> 00:26:31,730
So do I too, if it be not too much

220
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:34,548
brings a' victory in his pocket?
the wounds become him.

221
00:26:34,668 --> 00:26:36,807
Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?

222
00:26:36,927 --> 00:26:39,570
Titus Lartius writes, they fought together, but
Aufidius got off.

223
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:43,554
In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.
The gods grant them true!

224
00:26:43,674 --> 00:26:45,915
- True ?
-I'll be sworn they are true.

225
00:26:46,121 --> 00:26:49,014
- Where is he wounded?
- I' the shoulder and i' the left arm

226
00:26:49,134 --> 00:26:52,826
there will be large cicatrices to show the people,
when he shall stand for his place

227
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:56,462
He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five
wounds upon him.

228
00:26:56,582 --> 00:26:58,640
Now it's twenty-seven

229
00:27:00,724 --> 00:27:03,094
every gash was an enemy's grave.

230
00:27:25,259 --> 00:27:30,078
before him he carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears

231
00:27:30,638 --> 00:27:35,690
Death, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie

232
00:27:36,001 --> 00:27:40,528
Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.

233
00:27:50,263 --> 00:27:52,908
be it known, as to us, to all the world

234
00:27:53,028 --> 00:27:55,499
that Caius Marcius
Wears this war's garland

235
00:27:55,619 --> 00:28:00,079
and from this time,
For what he did before Corioli,

236
00:28:00,199 --> 00:28:03,640
call him,With all the applause and clamour of the host,

237
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,909
CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS!

238
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:09,707
Bear the addition nobly ever!

239
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:13,792
CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS

240
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:26,345
No more of this; it does offend my heart:
Pray now, no more.

241
00:28:26,465 --> 00:28:28,106
Look, sir, your mother!

242
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:39,076
O,You have, I know, petition'd all the gods
For my prosperity!

243
00:28:39,196 --> 00:28:40,681
Nay, my good soldier, up .

244
00:28:41,866 --> 00:28:44,887
My gentle Marcius, worthy Caius,

245
00:28:45,345 --> 00:28:47,982
and by deed-achieving honour newly named,
What is it ?

246
00:28:49,166 --> 00:28:53,301
Coriolanus must I call you?

247
00:28:55,097 --> 00:28:57,024
But O, thy wife!

248
00:28:59,273 --> 00:29:02,673
My gracious silence, hail!

249
00:29:06,756 --> 00:29:11,054
Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,
That weep'st to see me triumph?

250
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:16,536
Ay, my dear,
Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear,

251
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:19,307
And mothers that lack sons.

252
00:29:22,824 --> 00:29:26,383
- Now, the gods crown thee!
- And live you yet?

253
00:29:26,503 --> 00:29:29,351
I could weep and I could laugh, I am light and heavy.

254
00:29:30,017 --> 00:29:31,916
I know not where to turn

255
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:35,036
O, you're welcome home
and ye're welcome all.

256
00:29:35,156 --> 00:29:38,249
- A hundred thousand welcomes.
- Welcome home!

257
00:29:39,648 --> 00:29:40,916
Welcome home,welcome!

258
00:29:42,441 --> 00:29:44,386
Benvenuto Coriolano!

259
00:29:49,977 --> 00:29:55,417
Will newly general coriolanus
stand for consulship ?

260
00:29:55,918 --> 00:29:58,121
<i>'Tis thought that Marcius shall be consul</i>

261
00:29:58,241 --> 00:30:01,375
<i>I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and
the blind to bear him speak</i>

262
00:30:01,495 --> 00:30:05,842
<i> matrons flung gloves,Ladies and maids
their scarfs and handkerchers,upon him as he pass'd</i>

263
00:30:05,962 --> 00:30:08,281
<i> the nobles bended,
As to Jove's statue,</i>

264
00:30:08,401 --> 00:30:12,871
<i>and the commons made a shower and thunder
with their caps and shouts I never saw the like.</i>

265
00:30:13,323 --> 00:30:16,507
<i>Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?</i>

266
00:30:16,627 --> 00:30:17,825
<i>He has no equal.</i>

267
00:30:18,242 --> 00:30:20,161
When we were chosen tribunes for the people ...

268
00:30:20,281 --> 00:30:22,974
- Mark'd you his lip and eyes?
- Nay. but his taunts.

269
00:30:23,094 --> 00:30:25,771
The augurer tells me we shall have news to-night.

270
00:30:26,555 --> 00:30:27,866
Good or bad?

271
00:30:28,124 --> 00:30:31,941
Not according to the prayer of the people, for they
love not Marcius.

272
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,787
Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.

273
00:30:40,604 --> 00:30:42,866
You blame Marcius for being proud?

274
00:30:43,087 --> 00:30:45,144
We do it not alone, sir.

275
00:30:45,264 --> 00:30:48,223
I know you can do very little alone

276
00:30:51,272 --> 00:30:53,142
You talk of pride

277
00:30:53,826 --> 00:30:56,747
O that you could turn your eyes toward
the napes of your necks,

278
00:30:56,867 --> 00:31:00,452
and make but an interior survey of your good selves!
O that you could!

279
00:31:00,911 --> 00:31:02,096
What then, sir?

280
00:31:02,216 --> 00:31:08,514
Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,
proud, violent, testy magistrates,

281
00:31:08,634 --> 00:31:12,308
alias fools, as any in Rome.

282
00:31:12,428 --> 00:31:13,372
Menenius,

283
00:31:14,624 --> 00:31:16,558
you are known well enough too.

284
00:31:16,886 --> 00:31:19,299
I am known to be a humorous patrician,

285
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:23,337
and one that loves a cup of hot wine with
not a drop of allaying tiber in't

286
00:31:23,457 --> 00:31:27,336
one that converses more with the buttock of the night
than with the forehead of the morning

287
00:31:27,456 --> 00:31:29,427
what I think I utter

288
00:31:29,634 --> 00:31:31,629
and spend my malice in my breath.

289
00:31:31,749 --> 00:31:33,715
Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.

290
00:31:33,835 --> 00:31:38,231
You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing.

291
00:31:41,487 --> 00:31:42,680
You
are ambitious

292
00:31:47,014 --> 00:31:48,875
God-den to your worships

293
00:31:49,201 --> 00:31:52,430
more of your conversation would
infect my brain

294
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,587
How many stand for consulships?

295
00:31:54,707 --> 00:31:57,624
Three, they say , but 'tis thought of every one
Coriolanus will carry it.

296
00:31:57,744 --> 00:32:01,786
That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud, and
loves not the common people.

297
00:32:01,906 --> 00:32:05,014
there had been many great men that have
flattered the people, who ne'er loved them

298
00:32:05,134 --> 00:32:07,807
therefore, for Coriolanus neither to care
whether they love or hate him

299
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:10,677
manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition

300
00:32:10,797 --> 00:32:14,017
and out of his noble carelessness lets
them plainly see't.

301
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:17,272
but he seeks their hate with greater
devotion than can render it him

302
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,258
That seem to affect the malice and
displeasure of the people is

303
00:32:20,378 --> 00:32:23,055
as bad as that which he
dislikes, to flatter them for their love.

304
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:25,435
Consider you what services he has done for his country?

305
00:32:25,555 --> 00:32:30,337
Very well; and could be content to give him good
report fort, but that he pays himself with being proud.

306
00:32:30,457 --> 00:32:33,459
Nay, but speak not maliciously.

307
00:32:59,379 --> 00:33:03,301
The good patricians must be visited;
From whom I have received not only greetings,

308
00:33:03,421 --> 00:33:05,771
But with them change of honours.

309
00:33:07,634 --> 00:33:12,253
I have lived to see inherited my very wishes

310
00:33:12,872 --> 00:33:18,371
And the buildings of my fancy
There's one thing wanting,

311
00:33:19,059 --> 00:33:20,794
which I doubt not but

312
00:33:21,313 --> 00:33:25,647
Our Rome will cast upon thee.

313
00:33:25,767 --> 00:33:29,246
Know, good mother,
I had rather be their servant in my way,

314
00:33:29,754 --> 00:33:32,023
Than sway with them in theirs.

315
00:35:23,751 --> 00:35:25,128
coriolanus wil win .

316
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:28,378
Well , he's a good man,he'll win .

317
00:35:32,661 --> 00:35:36,650
- All tongues speak of him.
-On the sudden,I warrant him consul.

318
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:39,904
Then our office may,
During his power, go sleep.

319
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:44,271
He cannot temperately transport his honours
from where he should begin and end,

320
00:35:44,391 --> 00:35:45,939
but will Lose those he hath won.

321
00:35:46,059 --> 00:35:48,339
I heard him swear, were he to stand for consul,

322
00:35:48,459 --> 00:35:52,324
never would he appear i' the market-place
nor on him put the napless vesture of humility

323
00:35:52,444 --> 00:35:54,307
Nor showing, as the manner is his wounds
To the people, beg their stinking breaths.

324
00:35:54,427 --> 00:35:57,501
It was his word, It shall be to him
then as our good wills,a sure destruction.

325
00:35:57,621 --> 00:36:01,381
So it must fall out to him or
our authorities. For an end,

326
00:36:02,689 --> 00:36:05,422
We must suggest the people

327
00:36:05,542 --> 00:36:07,742
in what hatred He still hath held them

328
00:36:07,862 --> 00:36:12,467
To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze
Shall darken him for ever.

329
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:22,624
As the main point of this our after-meeting,
To gratify his noble service that

330
00:36:22,744 --> 00:36:24,827
Hath thus stood for his country

331
00:36:25,145 --> 00:36:28,058
therefore,please you,Most reverend and grave elders

332
00:36:28,178 --> 00:36:32,075
to desire the present consul, and last general
In our well-found successes

333
00:36:32,195 --> 00:36:37,072
to report a little of that worthy work perform'd
By Caius Marcius Coriolanus

334
00:36:37,648 --> 00:36:40,606
Speak, good Cominius

335
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:44,904
Nay, keep your place.

336
00:36:45,024 --> 00:36:48,659
Sit, Coriolanus; never shame to hear
What you have nobly done.

337
00:36:48,779 --> 00:36:51,551
Your horror's pardon,
I had rather have my wounds to heal again

338
00:36:51,671 --> 00:36:53,649
Than hear say how I got them.

339
00:36:53,769 --> 00:36:55,296
Pray now, sit down.

340
00:36:55,416 --> 00:36:58,317
I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun when the alarum were struck

341
00:36:58,437 --> 00:37:01,930
than idly sit
To hear my nothings monster'd.

342
00:37:12,347 --> 00:37:14,392
- Parla, buon Comino.
- Cominio, procedi.

343
00:37:14,512 --> 00:37:18,639
The deeds of Coriolanus
Should not be utter'd feebly.

344
00:37:19,123 --> 00:37:23,855
It is held that valour is the chiefest virtue,
and most dignifies the haver

345
00:37:24,051 --> 00:37:27,072
if it be,the man I speak of

346
00:37:27,192 --> 00:37:30,134
cannot in the world be singly counterpoised.

347
00:37:30,254 --> 00:37:34,363
<i>At sixteen years,
he fought beyond the mark of others</i>

348
00:37:34,483 --> 00:37:39,357
<i>When he might act the woman in the scene,
he proved best man i' the field,</i>

349
00:37:39,774 --> 00:37:44,585
<i>And in the brunt of seventeen battles since
He lurch'd all swords of the garland. </i>

350
00:37:44,952 --> 00:37:48,177
<i>For this last,
Before and in Corioli, </i>

351
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:51,423
<i>let me say,I cannot speak him home</i>

352
00:37:51,543 --> 00:37:54,607
<i>he stopp'd the fliers;
and by his rare example </i>

353
00:37:54,727 --> 00:37:57,558
<i>made the coward turn terror into sport</i>

354
00:37:57,678 --> 00:37:59,339
<i>from face to foot</i>

355
00:37:59,459 --> 00:38:04,237
<i>He was a thing of blood, whose every motion
was timed with dying cries</i>

356
00:38:04,861 --> 00:38:08,327
<i>alone he enter'd
The mortal gate of the city, </i>

357
00:38:08,447 --> 00:38:12,275
<i> which he painted with shunless destiny;
aidless came off,</i>

358
00:38:12,395 --> 00:38:17,717
<i>and with a  sudden reinforcement
struck Corioli like a planet</i>

359
00:38:18,369 --> 00:38:21,173
<i> and till we call'd
Both field and city ours,</i>

360
00:38:21,293 --> 00:38:24,550
<i>he never stood
To ease his breast with panting.</i>

361
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,998
<i>Our spoils he kick'd at,and look'd upon things
precious as they were</i>

362
00:38:27,403 --> 00:38:31,317
<i>And look'd upon things precious as they were
The common muck of the world</i>

363
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:34,905
<i>he covets less
Than misery itself would give;</i>

364
00:38:35,025 --> 00:38:41,082
<i>rewards his deeds with doing them,
and is content to spend the time to end it.</i>

365
00:38:52,209 --> 00:38:57,083
The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased
to make thee consul.

366
00:39:01,959 --> 00:39:05,522
I do owe them still
my life and services.

367
00:39:05,759 --> 00:39:08,563
It then remains that you do speak to the people.

368
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:14,396
I do beseech you,
let me o'erleap that custom,

369
00:39:14,516 --> 00:39:18,205
for I cannot entreat them,
for my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage

370
00:39:18,571 --> 00:39:20,833
please you that I may pass this doing.

371
00:39:20,953 --> 00:39:21,784
Sir,

372
00:39:22,703 --> 00:39:24,965
the people must have their voices

373
00:39:25,085 --> 00:39:26,641
Pray you, go fit you to the custom

374
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:29,875
It is apart that I shall blush in acting, and
might well be taken from the people.

375
00:39:29,995 --> 00:39:33,109
- Mark you that?
- To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus

376
00:39:33,229 --> 00:39:35,893
Show them the unaching
scars which I should hide,

377
00:39:36,105 --> 00:39:39,176
As if I had received them for
the hire of their breath only!

378
00:39:43,758 --> 00:39:47,212
and to our noble consul
wish we all joy and honour.

379
00:40:13,408 --> 00:40:18,523
<i>The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased
To make thee consul.</i>

380
00:40:18,643 --> 00:40:21,166
<i>I do owe them still
my life and services.</i>

381
00:40:21,286 --> 00:40:23,435
<i>It then remains
that you do speak to the people.</i>

382
00:40:23,555 --> 00:40:26,799
<i>- Let me o'erleap that custom,
- The people must have their voices</i>

383
00:40:26,919 --> 00:40:29,107
have you not known
the worthiest men have done't?

384
00:40:29,227 --> 00:40:33,893
Custom calls me to't:
what custom wills, in all things should we do't,

385
00:40:34,169 --> 00:40:35,596
What must I say?

386
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:38,671
Look, sir, my wounds!
I got them in my country's service,

387
00:40:38,791 --> 00:40:41,171
O me, the gods!
You must not speak of that

388
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:44,976
- you must desire them to think upon you.
-Think upon me!

389
00:40:45,369 --> 00:40:48,006
hang 'em!I would they would forget me

390
00:41:05,447 --> 00:41:09,819
pray you, speak to 'em, I pray you,
In wholesome manner.

391
00:41:09,939 --> 00:41:12,364
Bid them wash their faces
and keep their teeth clean.

392
00:41:45,897 --> 00:41:48,242
You know the cause, air, of my standing here.

393
00:41:48,362 --> 00:41:51,171
We do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't.

394
00:41:51,446 --> 00:41:54,400
- Mine own desert.
- Your own desert!

395
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:58,750
- Ay, but not mine own desire.
- How not your own desire?

396
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:02,371
No, 'twas never my desire yet to trouble the
poor with begging.

397
00:42:02,491 --> 00:42:06,214
You must think, if we give you
any thing, we hope to gain by you.

398
00:42:07,503 --> 00:42:10,198
Well then, I pray, your price o' the consulship?

399
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:13,924
The price is to ask it kindly.

400
00:42:14,044 --> 00:42:16,782
Kindly! Sir, I pray, let me ha't

401
00:42:17,775 --> 00:42:22,156
I have wounds to
show you, which shall be yours in private

402
00:42:23,213 --> 00:42:25,253
Your good voice, sir; what say you?

403
00:42:26,188 --> 00:42:28,599
You shall ha' it,worthy sir.

404
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,935
A match, sir.

405
00:42:30,936 --> 00:42:33,982
There's in all two worthy voices
begged , adieu.

406
00:42:35,809 --> 00:42:37,645
But this is something odd.

407
00:42:39,272 --> 00:42:43,987
Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your
voices that I may be consul,

408
00:42:44,354 --> 00:42:48,209
You have deserved nobly of your country, and you
have not deserved nobly.

409
00:42:48,901 --> 00:42:50,453
Your enigma?

410
00:42:50,573 --> 00:42:54,216
You have been a scourge to her enemies, you have
been a rod to her friends;

411
00:42:54,336 --> 00:42:56,783
you have not indeed loved
the common people.

412
00:42:57,362 --> 00:43:01,192
You should account me the more virtuous that I have
not been common in my love.

413
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:03,107
Noi speriamo d'averti amico

414
00:43:03,327 --> 00:43:05,597
We hope to find you our friend; and therefore give
you our voices heartily.

415
00:43:05,814 --> 00:43:08,284
I will make much of your voices,
and so trouble you no further.

416
00:43:08,404 --> 00:43:11,129
The gods give you joy, sir, heartily!

417
00:43:28,578 --> 00:43:30,189
Your voices

418
00:43:31,858 --> 00:43:35,383
for your voices I have fought;

419
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,554
Watch'd for your voices;

420
00:43:42,257 --> 00:43:45,357
Your voices bear
Of wounds two dozen odd;

421
00:43:47,546 --> 00:43:52,011
battles thrice six
I have seen and heard of;

422
00:43:52,916 --> 00:43:55,544
for your voices have
Done many things,

423
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,419
some less,some more

424
00:44:00,029 --> 00:44:01,431
your voices,

425
00:44:04,068 --> 00:44:05,261
Indeed

426
00:44:07,151 --> 00:44:08,628
I would be consul.

427
00:44:13,804 --> 00:44:15,639
He has done nobly,

428
00:44:15,881 --> 00:44:19,395
and cannot go without any honest
man's voice.

429
00:44:21,819 --> 00:44:25,515
Therefore let him be consul

430
00:44:25,635 --> 00:44:27,481
Amen!
Amen!

431
00:44:27,601 --> 00:44:29,339
Amen!

432
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:47,678
Worthy voices!

433
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:50,106
Worthy voices!Worthy voices!

434
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,212
You have stood your limitation;

435
00:45:00,506 --> 00:45:03,927
and the tribunes endue you with the people's voice

436
00:45:04,047 --> 00:45:05,318
Is this done?

437
00:45:06,478 --> 00:45:08,372
The custom of request you have discharged

438
00:45:08,492 --> 00:45:10,246
The people do admit you,

439
00:45:10,454 --> 00:45:12,490
and are summon'd
To meet anon, upon your approbation.

440
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:14,593
- Where? at the senate-house?
- There, Coriolanus.

441
00:45:14,713 --> 00:45:17,414
- May I change these garments?
- You may, sir.

442
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,954
I'll keep you company. Will you along?

443
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:25,489
We stay here for the people.

444
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:30,329
God save thee, noble consul!

445
00:45:32,123 --> 00:45:34,293
Consul! Consul!

446
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:42,592
How now, my masters!

447
00:45:45,797 --> 00:45:47,885
my masters , my masters !

448
00:45:48,005 --> 00:45:50,121
My masters , how now ?!

449
00:45:51,122 --> 00:45:52,566
have you chose this man?

450
00:45:52,686 --> 00:45:54,781
Yes !

451
00:45:54,901 --> 00:45:56,518
He has our voices, sir.

452
00:45:56,638 --> 00:45:58,863
We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.

453
00:45:58,983 --> 00:46:00,407
Amen, sir

454
00:46:00,713 --> 00:46:05,048
to my poor unworthy notice,
He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.

455
00:46:05,168 --> 00:46:07,293
He flouted us downright.

456
00:46:07,413 --> 00:46:08,753
No, no,no, no

457
00:46:09,034 --> 00:46:12,489
No,'tis his kind of speech, he did not mock us.

458
00:46:12,609 --> 00:46:14,933
he should have show'd us
His marks of merit,

459
00:46:15,053 --> 00:46:17,610
wounds received for's country.

460
00:46:18,033 --> 00:46:20,203
Why,  I am sure,so he did .

461
00:46:20,323 --> 00:46:22,145
No , he didn't .

462
00:46:22,265 --> 00:46:24,915
No, no; no one saw 'em.

463
00:46:30,392 --> 00:46:32,412
Was not this mockery?

464
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:34,848
Yes!yes!

465
00:46:39,603 --> 00:46:43,676
when he had no power,but was a petty
servant to the state,He was your enemy,

466
00:46:43,943 --> 00:46:46,004
ever spake against your liberties

467
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:52,000
Did you perceive he did solicit you in free contempt
when he did need your loves

468
00:46:52,514 --> 00:46:54,659
and do you think

469
00:46:54,779 --> 00:46:57,497
That his contempt shall not be bruising to you,
When he hath power to crush?

470
00:46:57,706 --> 00:47:00,593
Yes ! yes!

471
00:47:00,713 --> 00:47:02,328
He's not confirm'd !

472
00:47:02,721 --> 00:47:04,490
He's not confirm'd !

473
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:07,544
-  we may deny him yet.
- Yes ! yes !

474
00:47:07,664 --> 00:47:09,004
And will deny him

475
00:47:09,124 --> 00:47:12,181
I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.

476
00:47:12,301 --> 00:47:13,950
Yes !

477
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:16,463
I twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em.

478
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:17,253
Yes !

479
00:47:19,256 --> 00:47:22,193
Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends,
they have chose a consul

480
00:47:22,313 --> 00:47:24,167
that will from them take their liberties

481
00:47:24,287 --> 00:47:28,366
Let them assemble,and on a safer judgment all revoke
Your ignorant election;

482
00:47:28,486 --> 00:47:31,033
enforce his pride, and his old hate unto you

483
00:47:31,153 --> 00:47:35,106
And presently, when you have drawn your number,
Repair to the Senate.

484
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:43,507
<i>- Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?
- He had, my lord .</i>

485
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:45,977
<i>- Saw you Aufidius?
- he is retired to Antium.</i>

486
00:47:46,097 --> 00:47:48,148
<i>- Spoke he of me?
- He did, my lord.</i>

487
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:52,332
<i>- How? what?
- How often he had met you, sword to sword;</i>

488
00:47:52,621 --> 00:47:55,572
<i>That of all things upon the earth he hated
Your person most, </i>

489
00:47:55,692 --> 00:47:58,203
<i>- At Antium lives he?
- At Antium.</i>

490
00:47:58,583 --> 00:48:02,201
I wish I had a cause to seek him there,
To oppose his hatred fully.

491
00:48:14,522 --> 00:48:18,252
Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,
The tongues o' the common mouth

492
00:48:18,582 --> 00:48:20,568
- Pass no further.
- Ha! what is that?

493
00:48:20,688 --> 00:48:22,295
It will be dangerous to go on

494
00:48:22,415 --> 00:48:24,548
- What makes this change?
- The matter?

495
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:27,049
Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?

496
00:48:27,169 --> 00:48:29,730
- Cominius, no.
- Have I had children's voices?

497
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:32,188
- Tribunes, give way .
- The people are incensed against him.

498
00:48:32,308 --> 00:48:35,634
- Are these your herd?
- Be calm, be calm.

499
00:48:35,754 --> 00:48:38,369
The people cry you mock'd them, They made call'd them

500
00:48:38,489 --> 00:48:41,067
Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.

501
00:48:41,187 --> 00:48:44,651
- Why, this was known before.
- You show too much of that for which the people stir

502
00:48:44,771 --> 00:48:48,140
if you will pass to where you are bound,
you must inquire your way,with a gentler spirit,

503
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:51,266
- Let's be calm.
- The people are abused; set on.

504
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:53,505
This was my speech, and I will speak't again--

505
00:48:53,625 --> 00:48:55,258
Not now, not now.

506
00:48:55,378 --> 00:48:56,818
Not in this heat, sir, now.

507
00:48:56,938 --> 00:48:59,745
My nobler friends,
I crave their pardons

508
00:48:59,865 --> 00:49:03,697
For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them
Regard me as I do not flatter,

509
00:49:03,817 --> 00:49:05,466
and therein behold themselves

510
00:49:05,586 --> 00:49:06,868
I say again,

511
00:49:06,988 --> 00:49:10,091
In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate

512
00:49:10,211 --> 00:49:12,880
The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,

513
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,168
Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd,
and scatter'd,

514
00:49:16,288 --> 00:49:20,841
By mingling them with us, the honour'd number,
who lack not virtue, no, nor power,

515
00:49:20,961 --> 00:49:23,604
-  but that which they have given to beggars.
- Well, no more.

516
00:49:23,724 --> 00:49:25,358
No more words, we beseech you.

517
00:49:25,478 --> 00:49:29,339
You speak o' the people, as if you
were a god to punish, not a man of their infirmity.

518
00:49:29,459 --> 00:49:30,950
'Twere well
We let the people know't.

519
00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:33,567
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,
By Jove, 'twould be my mind!

520
00:49:33,687 --> 00:49:37,181
It is a mind that shall remain a poison where it is,
not poison any further.

521
00:49:37,301 --> 00:49:40,302
Shall remain!Hear you this Triton of the minnows?

522
00:49:40,422 --> 00:49:42,314
mark you his absolute 'shall'?

523
00:49:42,434 --> 00:49:44,592
Why, shall the people give
One that speaks thus their voice?

524
00:49:44,712 --> 00:49:48,253
I'll give my reasons,
More worthier than their voices.

525
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,810
By Jove himself!

526
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:54,297
It makes the consuls base

527
00:49:54,417 --> 00:49:56,859
and my soul aches to know,

528
00:49:56,979 --> 00:50:00,364
when two authorities are up,
neither supreme,

529
00:50:00,484 --> 00:50:05,024
how soon confusion may enter 'twixt the
gap of both and take the one by the other.

530
00:50:05,144 --> 00:50:07,728
Thus we debase the nature of our seats

531
00:50:07,848 --> 00:50:11,769
and make the rabble call our cares fears
which will in time

532
00:50:11,889 --> 00:50:15,943
Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in
the crows to peck the eagles.

533
00:50:16,063 --> 00:50:18,371
- Come, enough.
- Enough, with over-measure.

534
00:50:18,491 --> 00:50:21,567
Has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer
as traitors do.

535
00:50:21,687 --> 00:50:24,239
Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!

536
00:50:24,359 --> 00:50:26,884
- Manifest treason!
- This a consul? no.

537
00:50:29,393 --> 00:50:31,112
Hence, old goat!

538
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:38,011
On both sides more respect.

539
00:50:43,837 --> 00:50:48,501
Here's he that would take from you all your power.

540
00:50:48,621 --> 00:50:52,306
You are at point to lose your liberties

541
00:50:52,426 --> 00:50:55,053
Marcius would have all from you;

542
00:50:55,253 --> 00:50:58,324
Marcius, whom late you have named for consul.

543
00:51:01,803 --> 00:51:04,148
What is the city but the people?

544
00:51:04,357 --> 00:51:07,736
True, the people are the city.

545
00:51:07,932 --> 00:51:10,143
the people are the city.

546
00:51:15,251 --> 00:51:18,130
We do here pronounce,
Upon the part o' the people,

547
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:21,584
Marcius is worthy of present death.

548
00:51:23,842 --> 00:51:25,837
Death !
Death!

549
00:51:27,305 --> 00:51:28,407
seize him!

550
00:51:28,941 --> 00:51:31,002
No, I'll die here.

551
00:51:36,337 --> 00:51:40,301
Go, get you to your house; be gone, away!
All will be naught else.

552
00:51:40,421 --> 00:51:42,375
Come, sir, along with us.

553
00:52:46,205 --> 00:52:50,953
As I do know the consul's worthiness,
So can I name his faults,--

554
00:52:51,073 --> 00:52:52,830
Consul! what consul?

555
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:55,806
- The consul Coriolanus.
- He consul!

556
00:52:55,926 --> 00:53:00,370
- It is decreed he dies to-night.
- He's a disease that must be cut away.

557
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:03,280
O, he's a limb that has but a disease;

558
00:53:04,435 --> 00:53:07,464
Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy.

559
00:53:09,968 --> 00:53:12,705
What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?

560
00:53:14,854 --> 00:53:16,389
Killing our enemies?

561
00:53:20,629 --> 00:53:24,309
the blood he hath lost...
he dropp'd it for his country;

562
00:53:24,429 --> 00:53:26,079
-This is clean kam.
-We'll hear no more.

563
00:53:26,199 --> 00:53:27,342
Consider This!

564
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:31,895
he has been bred i' the wars
Since he could draw a sword.

565
00:53:32,812 --> 00:53:35,550
and is ill school'd
In bolted language.

566
00:53:37,002 --> 00:53:40,930
Give me leave,
I'll go to him, and undertake to bring him

567
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:44,344
Where he shall answer,
by a lawful form In peace

568
00:53:45,404 --> 00:53:47,123
to his utmost peril.

569
00:53:47,243 --> 00:53:49,459
Noble tribunes,
It is the humane way.

570
00:53:49,579 --> 00:53:52,114
- Menenius...
- Be you then as the people's officer.

571
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:56,278
if you bring not Marcius...

572
00:53:57,125 --> 00:53:59,203
we'll proceed
In our first way.

573
00:54:01,243 --> 00:54:02,286
I'll bring him to you.

574
00:54:05,406 --> 00:54:07,747
Let them puff all about mine ears!

575
00:54:07,935 --> 00:54:10,752
present me
Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,

576
00:54:10,872 --> 00:54:12,415
yet will I still
Be thus to them.

577
00:54:12,535 --> 00:54:15,803
I muse my mother
Does not approve me further!

578
00:54:16,113 --> 00:54:19,535
I talk of you
Why did you wish me milder?

579
00:54:19,768 --> 00:54:22,088
would you have me
False to my nature?

580
00:54:22,964 --> 00:54:25,843
Rather say I play
The man I am.

581
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:33,809
O, sir, sir, sir,

582
00:54:34,718 --> 00:54:38,849
I would have had you put your power well on,
Before you had worn it out.

583
00:54:38,969 --> 00:54:40,017
Let go!

584
00:54:40,137 --> 00:54:43,924
You might have been enough the man you are,
With striving less to be so

585
00:54:44,358 --> 00:54:46,686
- Let them hang!
- Ay, and burn too!

586
00:54:46,806 --> 00:54:48,956
Come, come, you have been too rough, something
too rough;

587
00:54:49,076 --> 00:54:51,031
You must return and mend it.

588
00:54:51,151 --> 00:54:55,891
There's no remedy;unless, by not so doing,
our good city cleave in the midst, and perish.

589
00:54:56,425 --> 00:54:59,254
Pray, be counsell'd:

590
00:54:59,892 --> 00:55:02,062
I have a heart as little apt as yours,

591
00:55:02,871 --> 00:55:05,033
But yet a brain...

592
00:55:05,153 --> 00:55:07,674
that leads my use of anger
To better vantage.

593
00:55:07,794 --> 00:55:09,706
- Well said, noble woman .
- What must I do?

594
00:55:09,826 --> 00:55:11,971
- Return to the tribunes.
- Well, what then? what then?

595
00:55:12,091 --> 00:55:14,361
- Repent what you have spoke.
- For them?

596
00:55:14,481 --> 00:55:17,298
I cannot do it to the gods;
Must I then do't to them?

597
00:55:20,884 --> 00:55:23,554
You are too absolute;

598
00:55:25,907 --> 00:55:27,710
I have heard you say,

599
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:32,227
Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends,
I' the war do grow together

600
00:55:32,347 --> 00:55:33,738
Why force you this?

601
00:55:34,864 --> 00:55:38,336
Because that now it lies you on to speak
To the people

602
00:55:38,945 --> 00:55:40,939
ot by your own instruction,

603
00:55:41,127 --> 00:55:43,413
Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,

604
00:55:43,614 --> 00:55:47,035
But with such words that are but rooted in
Your tongue,

605
00:55:47,527 --> 00:55:52,492
hough but bastards and syllables
Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.

606
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:58,064
I would dissemble with my nature

607
00:55:58,290 --> 00:56:03,138
where my fortunes and my friends at stake required
I should do so in honour

608
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:05,688
I am in this,
Your wife,

609
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:09,839
your son, these senators, the nobles;

610
00:56:11,466 --> 00:56:12,550
And you.

611
00:56:15,613 --> 00:56:17,098
I prithee now, my son,

612
00:56:18,316 --> 00:56:19,301
Go to them,

613
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:20,878
be with them,

614
00:56:21,487 --> 00:56:22,822
say to them,

615
00:56:23,357 --> 00:56:26,169
Thou art their soldier,

616
00:56:27,826 --> 00:56:31,347
and being bred in broils
Hast not the soft way

617
00:56:31,581 --> 00:56:33,625
In asking their good loves.

618
00:56:34,698 --> 00:56:36,367
but...

619
00:56:36,817 --> 00:56:38,603
thou wilt frame
Thyself,

620
00:56:39,412 --> 00:56:41,649
forsooth, hereafter theirs.

621
00:56:42,466 --> 00:56:47,231
This but done,
Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;

622
00:56:48,236 --> 00:56:50,639
Prithee now,
Go, and be ruled.

623
00:56:51,982 --> 00:56:55,245
sir,'tis fit
You make strong party,

624
00:56:55,549 --> 00:56:58,061
or defend yourself
By calmness or by absence

625
00:56:58,181 --> 00:57:01,300
- all's in anger.
- Only fair speech.

626
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:04,539
I think 'twill serve, if he
Can thereto frame his spirit.

627
00:57:04,659 --> 00:57:05,707
He must do it!

628
00:57:08,653 --> 00:57:09,541
You will.

629
00:57:10,651 --> 00:57:13,839
Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.

630
00:57:14,089 --> 00:57:19,797
Must I with base tongue give my noble heart
a lie that it must bear?

631
00:57:20,548 --> 00:57:23,272
Well, I will do't

632
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:30,002
Away, my disposition, and possess me
Some harlot's spirit!

633
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:33,993
a beggar's tongue
make motion through my lips

634
00:57:36,471 --> 00:57:37,844
I will not do't,

635
00:57:37,964 --> 00:57:40,356
Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth

636
00:57:40,754 --> 00:57:44,442
And by my body's action teach my mind
a most inherent baseness.

637
00:57:45,043 --> 00:57:46,170
At thy choice, then

638
00:57:46,966 --> 00:57:49,879
To beg of thee, it is my more dishonour
Than thou of them.

639
00:57:49,999 --> 00:57:51,472
Come all to ruin;

640
00:57:52,729 --> 00:57:57,821
let Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear
Thy dangerous stoutness,

641
00:57:59,614 --> 00:58:01,268
for I mock at death
with as big heart as thou.

642
00:58:01,832 --> 00:58:03,159
Do as you like.

643
00:58:11,910 --> 00:58:16,091
Thy valiantness
was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,

644
00:58:16,545 --> 00:58:18,623
But owe thy pride thyself.

645
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:21,686
Pray, be content, Mother
I am going,

646
00:58:22,875 --> 00:58:26,346
Chide me no more. Look!

647
00:58:27,222 --> 00:58:28,916
I am going!

648
00:58:31,549 --> 00:58:33,255
I'll return consul.

649
00:58:33,375 --> 00:58:37,261
Or never trust to what my tongue can do
I' the way of flattery further.

650
00:58:37,596 --> 00:58:38,956
Do your will.

651
00:58:39,319 --> 00:58:42,824
In this point charge him home, that he affects
Tyrannical power,

652
00:58:43,216 --> 00:58:46,862
if he evade us there,
Enforce him with his envy to the people,

653
00:58:46,982 --> 00:58:50,258
Have you a catalogue Of all the voices
that we have procured Set down by the poll?

654
00:58:50,378 --> 00:58:51,691
I have; 'tis ready.

655
00:58:51,969 --> 00:58:55,386
And the people hither me say 'It shall be so
I' the right and strength o' the commons,

656
00:58:55,506 --> 00:58:58,324
' be it either
For death, for fine, or banishment,

657
00:58:58,444 --> 00:59:01,271
then let them hear me say
Fine, cry 'Fine;' if death, cry 'Death.'

658
00:59:01,391 --> 00:59:02,915
I shall inform them.

659
00:59:04,139 --> 00:59:06,000
May God preserve you!

660
00:59:37,471 --> 00:59:39,840
The people are 'the city'.

661
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:43,128
I'm not been ready for each of common ,
Calmly, I do beseech you.

662
01:00:05,062 --> 01:00:06,530
The honour'd...

663
01:00:17,709 --> 01:00:23,573
The honour'd gods keep Rome in safety,
and the chairs of justice supplied with worthy men!

664
01:00:24,279 --> 01:00:26,533
plant love among 's!

665
01:00:27,242 --> 01:00:31,994
Throng our large temples with the shows of peace,
And not our streets with war!

666
01:00:32,114 --> 01:00:33,374
<i>- Amen!
- Amen!</i>

667
01:00:33,494 --> 01:00:34,722
A noble wish.

668
01:00:34,842 --> 01:00:37,546
Shall I be charged no further than this present?

669
01:00:37,896 --> 01:00:39,761
Must all determine here?

670
01:00:39,881 --> 01:00:43,925
I do demand,
If you submit you to the people's voices,

671
01:00:45,370 --> 01:00:46,521
I am content.

672
01:00:46,763 --> 01:00:49,558
Lo, citizens, he says he is content

673
01:00:50,167 --> 01:00:53,781
The warlike service he has done.

674
01:00:54,327 --> 01:00:59,158
Consider,think upon the wounds his body bears, which show
Like graves i' the holy churchyard.

675
01:00:59,278 --> 01:01:01,829
Scratches with briers,
Scars to move laughter only.

676
01:01:03,048 --> 01:01:06,144
Consider further,
That when he speaks not like a citizen,

677
01:01:06,264 --> 01:01:08,193
You find him like a soldier.

678
01:01:08,313 --> 01:01:11,284
do not take
His rougher accents for malicious sounds,

679
01:01:11,404 --> 01:01:15,687
But, as I say, such as become a soldier.

680
01:01:16,107 --> 01:01:20,246
What is the matter
That being pass'd for consul with full voice,

681
01:01:20,446 --> 01:01:24,264
I am so dishonour'd that the very hour
You take it off again?

682
01:01:24,384 --> 01:01:28,568
We charge you, that you have contrived to take
From Rome all season'd office,

683
01:01:28,688 --> 01:01:31,272
and to wind
Yourself into a power tyrannical;

684
01:01:31,392 --> 01:01:33,260
For which you are a traitor to the people.

685
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:34,179
traitor?

686
01:01:34,299 --> 01:01:35,577
traitor!

687
01:01:35,697 --> 01:01:38,664
- Nay, temperately; your promise.
- The fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people!

688
01:01:38,784 --> 01:01:41,813
Call me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune!

689
01:01:41,933 --> 01:01:43,140
Mark you this, people?

690
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:46,369
Yeah!
Traitor!

691
01:01:46,489 --> 01:01:49,529
he hath
Served well for Rome.

692
01:01:49,649 --> 01:01:51,290
What do you prate of service?

693
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:53,185
- I talk of that, that know it.
- You!

694
01:01:53,305 --> 01:01:54,987
Is this the promise that you made your mother?

695
01:01:55,107 --> 01:01:59,186
I know no further , let them pronounce to the death,
Exile, Flame,

696
01:01:59,306 --> 01:02:02,598
I would not buy
Their mercy at the price of one fair word!

697
01:02:02,882 --> 01:02:07,537
in the name o' the people and in the power of us
The tribunes we even from this instant,

698
01:02:07,657 --> 01:02:11,462
banish him our city,
I' the people's name i say,

699
01:02:12,004 --> 01:02:15,559
It shall be so, it shall be so.

700
01:02:15,934 --> 01:02:18,683
He's banish'd, and it shall be so.

701
01:02:18,803 --> 01:02:21,913
It shall be so, it shall be so!

702
01:02:22,161 --> 01:02:24,180
It shall be so, it shall be so!

703
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:26,879
Hear me, my masters, and my common friends...

704
01:02:26,999 --> 01:02:29,675
- He's sentenced; no more hearing.
- Let me speak.

705
01:02:30,857 --> 01:02:35,997
I have been consul, and can show for Rome
Her enemies' marks upon me.

706
01:02:36,117 --> 01:02:38,768
There's no more to be said, but he is banish'd,

707
01:02:38,888 --> 01:02:41,514
As enemy to the people and his country.

708
01:02:41,634 --> 01:02:44,682
It shall be so, it shall be so!

709
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:47,242
It shall be so, it shall be so!

710
01:03:06,063 --> 01:03:07,874
No!

711
01:03:07,994 --> 01:03:11,612
You common cry of curs!

712
01:03:11,732 --> 01:03:17,352
whose breath I hate
as reek o' the rotten fens,

713
01:03:17,472 --> 01:03:19,833
whose loves I prize

714
01:03:19,953 --> 01:03:26,304
As the dead carcasses of unburied men
That do corrupt my air.

715
01:03:26,424 --> 01:03:28,911
I banish you.

716
01:03:29,444 --> 01:03:35,077
And here remain with your uncertainty!

717
01:03:36,165 --> 01:03:39,382
Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts!

718
01:03:39,502 --> 01:03:42,313
Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,

719
01:03:42,433 --> 01:03:45,071
Fan you into despair!

720
01:03:45,396 --> 01:03:49,477
Have the power still
To banish your defenders,

721
01:03:49,597 --> 01:03:54,992
till at length your ignorance,
which finds not till it feels,

722
01:03:55,112 --> 01:03:57,885
Making not reservation of yourselves,

723
01:03:58,005 --> 01:04:02,056
Still your own foes, deliver you,

724
01:04:02,425 --> 01:04:06,013
as most abated captives to some nation,

725
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:09,385
That won you without blows!

726
01:04:13,185 --> 01:04:14,687
Despising,

727
01:04:15,129 --> 01:04:16,765
For you,

728
01:04:17,458 --> 01:04:18,726
The city.

729
01:04:20,137 --> 01:04:20,821
Thus,

730
01:04:23,099 --> 01:04:24,830
I turn my back.

731
01:04:27,342 --> 01:04:28,669
There is a world,

732
01:04:30,625 --> 01:04:31,735
Elsewhere.

733
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:45,133
The people's enemy is gone!

734
01:06:12,938 --> 01:06:16,218
Nay, mother,
Where is your ancient courage?

735
01:06:16,906 --> 01:06:19,343
<i>You are too absolute.</i>

736
01:06:21,203 --> 01:06:24,190
My mother, I shall be loved when I am lack'd.

737
01:06:25,709 --> 01:06:27,578
I go alone.

738
01:06:28,187 --> 01:06:30,256
Like to a lonely dragon.

739
01:07:40,882 --> 01:07:43,570
- The gods preserve you both!!
- God-den to you all.

740
01:07:43,762 --> 01:07:44,977
God-den to you all.

741
01:07:45,097 --> 01:07:47,904
- Today the life and 'more' happy, more 'beautiful.
- Yes.

742
01:07:48,024 --> 01:07:49,560
- Good day.
- Good day.

743
01:07:52,873 --> 01:07:55,860
- Here comes his mother.
- They say she's mad.

744
01:07:57,471 --> 01:07:59,273
O, ye're well met.

745
01:07:59,573 --> 01:08:03,237
The hoarded plague o' the gods
Requite your love!

746
01:08:04,376 --> 01:08:05,586
Will you be gone?

747
01:08:05,706 --> 01:08:09,258
You shall stay too  , I would I had the power
To say so to my husband.

748
01:08:09,378 --> 01:08:10,192
Are you mad?

749
01:08:10,312 --> 01:08:14,646
Ay, fool; is that a shame? tell me what

750
01:08:14,766 --> 01:08:18,931
Hadst thou craft
To banish him that struck more blows for Rome

751
01:08:19,051 --> 01:08:20,730
Than thou hast spoken words?

752
01:08:21,617 --> 01:08:24,964
- O blessed heavens!
- More noble blows than ever thou wise words

753
01:08:25,866 --> 01:08:28,563
And for Rome's good.

754
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:30,323
Now go 'way.

755
01:08:30,770 --> 01:08:34,001
Nay, but thou shalt stay too.

756
01:08:34,121 --> 01:08:36,043
Tell you what,

757
01:08:36,325 --> 01:08:39,465
I would my son
Were in Arabia,

758
01:08:39,656 --> 01:08:43,302
and thy tribe before him,
His good sword in his hand.

759
01:08:43,422 --> 01:08:47,325
- What then?
- What then! He'ld make an end of thy posterity.

760
01:08:47,445 --> 01:08:50,513
- Bastards and all.
-Come, come, peace.

761
01:08:50,633 --> 01:08:51,975
Well, well, let's go.

762
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:56,779
Why stay we to be baited
With one that wants her wits?

763
01:08:59,452 --> 01:09:03,737
I would the gods had nothing else to do,

764
01:09:03,857 --> 01:09:06,860
But to confirm my curses!

765
01:09:12,141 --> 01:09:14,978
Could I meet 'em
But once a-day,

766
01:09:15,253 --> 01:09:19,317
it would unclog my heart
Of what lies heavy to't.

767
01:09:20,423 --> 01:09:23,873
You have told them home;
And, by my troth, you have cause.

768
01:09:25,342 --> 01:09:27,044
You'll sup with me?

769
01:09:28,046 --> 01:09:29,381
Anger's my meat.

770
01:09:31,767 --> 01:09:33,611
I sup upon myself,

771
01:09:35,411 --> 01:09:38,064
And so shall starve with feeding.

772
01:11:27,358 --> 01:11:29,669
ANTIUM

773
01:12:09,299 --> 01:12:10,959
Oh, Aufidius.

774
01:12:15,634 --> 01:12:17,186
General!

775
01:13:39,944 --> 01:13:41,538
Whence comest thou?

776
01:13:47,105 --> 01:13:48,357
thy name?

777
01:13:50,076 --> 01:13:54,282
Speak, man
What's thy name?

778
01:13:54,532 --> 01:13:59,071
A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,
And harsh in sound to thine.

779
01:13:59,191 --> 01:13:59,881
Say!

780
01:14:01,466 --> 01:14:03,085
What's thy name?

781
01:14:04,987 --> 01:14:07,132
Thou hast a grim appearance.

782
01:14:09,581 --> 01:14:10,574
What's thy name?

783
01:14:12,931 --> 01:14:15,918
- know'st thou me yet?
- I know thee not.

784
01:14:18,438 --> 01:14:20,841
- thy name?
- My name

785
01:14:22,026 --> 01:14:23,929
is Caius Marcius,

786
01:14:25,489 --> 01:14:28,209
Who hath done
To thee particularly,

787
01:14:28,610 --> 01:14:32,490
and to all the Volsces
Great hurt and mischief.

788
01:14:33,546 --> 01:14:36,517
thereto witness may
my surname

789
01:14:37,234 --> 01:14:39,537
Coriolanus.

790
01:14:41,506 --> 01:14:43,876
Only that name remains,

791
01:14:44,485 --> 01:14:46,913
The cruelty and envy of the people,

792
01:14:47,114 --> 01:14:50,176
Who have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest.

793
01:14:50,623 --> 01:14:55,029
And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be
Whoop'd out of Rome.

794
01:14:56,072 --> 01:14:58,826
Now this extremity
Hath brought me to thy hearth,

795
01:14:58,946 --> 01:15:02,339
ot out of hope--
Mistake me not--to save my life.

796
01:15:02,536 --> 01:15:04,406
for if
I had fear'd death,

797
01:15:04,526 --> 01:15:07,685
of all the men i' the world
I would have 'voided thee,

798
01:15:07,966 --> 01:15:09,635
but in mere spite,

799
01:15:10,118 --> 01:15:14,792
To be full quit of those my banishers,
Stand I before thee here.

800
01:15:16,753 --> 01:15:18,004
I will fight,

801
01:15:18,204 --> 01:15:23,178
Against my canker'd country with the spleen
Of all the under fiends.

802
01:15:25,005 --> 01:15:27,171
But if so be
Thou darest not this,

803
01:15:28,698 --> 01:15:32,766
and present
my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice.

804
01:15:33,233 --> 01:15:36,630
Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,

805
01:15:36,750 --> 01:15:39,233
Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,

806
01:15:39,902 --> 01:15:42,147
And cannot live but to thy shame,

807
01:15:43,661 --> 01:15:46,732
Unless
It be to do thee service.

808
01:16:08,465 --> 01:16:09,792
O Marcius!

809
01:16:11,099 --> 01:16:12,359
Marcius!

810
01:16:14,571 --> 01:16:16,749
Each word thou hast spoke,

811
01:16:17,082 --> 01:16:20,495
hath weeded from my heart
a root of ancient envy.

812
01:16:26,937 --> 01:16:29,140
Let me twine
Mine arms,

813
01:16:29,658 --> 01:16:31,093
about that body,

814
01:16:39,588 --> 01:16:41,123
Know thou ,

815
01:16:42,375 --> 01:16:44,495
I loved the maid I married,

816
01:16:44,695 --> 01:16:46,881
Never man
Sigh'd truer breath.

817
01:16:47,874 --> 01:16:50,444
but that I see thee here,

818
01:16:51,863 --> 01:16:53,874
Thou noble thing!

819
01:16:55,096 --> 01:16:58,459
More dances my rapt heart

820
01:16:58,771 --> 01:17:02,427
Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
Bestride my threshold.

821
01:17:04,830 --> 01:17:06,924
Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,

822
01:17:07,195 --> 01:17:10,016
Thou hast beat me out
Twelve several times,

823
01:17:10,382 --> 01:17:15,919
and I have nightly since
Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me

824
01:17:18,949 --> 01:17:20,718
Worthy Marcius,

825
01:17:21,503 --> 01:17:25,191
Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that
Thou art thence banish'd,

826
01:17:25,311 --> 01:17:27,842
We would muster all
From twelve to seventy,

827
01:17:27,962 --> 01:17:30,347
And pouring war
Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,

828
01:17:30,467 --> 01:17:32,959
Like a bold flood o'er-bear.

829
01:18:21,365 --> 01:18:23,018
O, come, go in,

830
01:18:23,138 --> 01:18:26,222
And take our friendly senators by the hands;

831
01:18:27,551 --> 01:18:29,395
You bless me, gods!

832
01:18:55,631 --> 01:18:57,066
Therefore,

833
01:18:57,875 --> 01:18:59,661
Most absolute sir,

834
01:19:00,687 --> 01:19:03,600
if thou wilt have
The leading of thine own revenges,

835
01:19:04,034 --> 01:19:06,195
take the one half of my commission;

836
01:19:07,709 --> 01:19:12,494
and set down...
As best thou art experienced,

837
01:19:12,614 --> 01:19:16,353
since thou know'st
Thy country's strength and weakness...thine own ways;

838
01:19:16,944 --> 01:19:19,502
Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,

839
01:19:19,622 --> 01:19:23,987
Or rudely visit them in parts remote,
To fright them, ere destroy.

840
01:19:39,227 --> 01:19:40,404
Is this Menenius?

841
01:19:40,524 --> 01:19:44,497
'Tis he,'tis he, O, he is grown most kind of late.
Hail sir!

842
01:19:44,617 --> 01:19:46,082
Hail to you both!

843
01:19:46,202 --> 01:19:48,854
Your Coriolanus
Is not much miss'd, but with his friends ,

844
01:19:49,062 --> 01:19:50,757
All's well;

845
01:19:50,977 --> 01:19:53,556
and might have been much better, if
He could have temporized.

846
01:19:54,002 --> 01:19:56,739
<i>- Where is he, hear you?
- Nay, I hear nothing</i>

847
01:19:57,423 --> 01:19:59,618
His mother and his wife
Hear nothing from him.

848
01:19:59,738 --> 01:20:02,433
Caius Marcius was
A worthy officer i' the war...

849
01:20:02,553 --> 01:20:05,871
insolent, O'ercome with pride,
ambitious  past all thinking,

850
01:20:05,991 --> 01:20:07,667
- Self-loving...
- I think not so.

851
01:20:07,787 --> 01:20:09,870
and Rome
Sits safe and still without him.

852
01:20:16,492 --> 01:20:21,916
<i>There are reports the Volsces with two several powers
Are enter'd in the Roman territories,</i>

853
01:20:22,141 --> 01:20:26,643
<i>And with the deepest malice of the war
Destroy what lies before 'em.</i>

854
01:20:27,338 --> 01:20:28,506
'Tis Aufidius!

855
01:20:28,973 --> 01:20:33,625
Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment,
Thrusts forth his horns into the world again;

856
01:20:33,745 --> 01:20:34,969
Come what talk you
Of Marcius?

857
01:20:35,089 --> 01:20:37,397
It cannot be
The Volsces dare break with us.

858
01:20:37,517 --> 01:20:38,730
Cannot be!

859
01:20:39,272 --> 01:20:41,091
We have record that very well it can,

860
01:20:41,211 --> 01:20:43,936
<i>The nobles in great earnestness are going
All to the senate-house</i>

861
01:20:44,192 --> 01:20:47,705
<i>some news is come
That turns their countenances.</i>

862
01:20:47,951 --> 01:20:52,227
<i>Yes, The slave's report is seconded; and more,
More fearful, is deliver'd.</i>

863
01:20:52,811 --> 01:20:56,028
<i>Marcius,
Join'd with Aufidius</i>

864
01:20:56,148 --> 01:21:00,264
<i> He leads a power 'gainst Rome,
And vows revenge as</i>

865
01:21:00,384 --> 01:21:04,416
<i>spacious as between
The young'st and oldest thing.</i>

866
01:21:07,082 --> 01:21:11,388
<i>A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius
Associated with Aufidius,</i>

867
01:21:11,508 --> 01:21:15,227
rages upon our territories; and have already
O'erborne their way,

868
01:21:15,347 --> 01:21:18,107
consumed with fire, and took
What lay before them.

869
01:21:18,588 --> 01:21:22,276
<i>Marcius, Join'd with The Volsce.
He is their god.</i>

870
01:21:22,396 --> 01:21:25,058
<i>He leads them like boys
pursuing summer butterflies</i>

871
01:21:25,178 --> 01:21:26,977
<i>Or butchers killing flies.</i>

872
01:22:17,495 --> 01:22:19,297
Do they still fly to the Roman?

873
01:22:19,417 --> 01:22:21,776
I do not know what witchcraft's in him,

874
01:22:21,896 --> 01:22:24,810
but Your soldiers use him
as the grace 'fore meat,

875
01:22:25,022 --> 01:22:27,918
Their talk at table,
and their thanks at end

876
01:22:28,038 --> 01:22:30,709
And you are darken'd in this action, sir,

877
01:22:33,437 --> 01:22:37,197
He bears himself more proudlier,
Even to my person,

878
01:22:37,317 --> 01:22:40,134
than I thought he would
When first I did embrace him

879
01:22:40,836 --> 01:22:42,013
sir,

880
01:22:42,539 --> 01:22:45,251
I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?

881
01:22:47,512 --> 01:22:51,133
I think he'll be to Rome
As is the osprey to the fish,

882
01:22:51,747 --> 01:22:54,617
who takes it
By sovereignty of nature.

883
01:23:51,268 --> 01:23:52,920
Whether 'twas pride,

884
01:23:53,888 --> 01:23:55,849
Whether defect of judgment

885
01:23:57,772 --> 01:24:01,375
or whether nature,
Not to be other than one thing,

886
01:24:01,723 --> 01:24:03,517
...made him fear'd,

887
01:24:04,155 --> 01:24:06,550
So hated, and so banish'd

888
01:24:08,531 --> 01:24:13,693
So our virtues
Lie in the interpretation of the time

889
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:17,792
One fire drives out one fire;

890
01:24:19,119 --> 01:24:21,072
one nail, one nail;

891
01:24:23,817 --> 01:24:25,536
Rights by rights falter,

892
01:24:26,862 --> 01:24:30,250
strengths by strengths do fail.

893
01:24:33,004 --> 01:24:33,872
When,

894
01:24:34,932 --> 01:24:35,900
Caius,

895
01:24:37,552 --> 01:24:38,645
Rome is thine,

896
01:24:40,026 --> 01:24:42,053
Thou art poor'st of all;

897
01:24:43,943 --> 01:24:46,321
then shortly...

898
01:24:47,143 --> 01:24:48,595
art thou mine.

899
01:24:49,672 --> 01:24:51,190
No, I'll not go

900
01:24:51,449 --> 01:24:54,145
- Good Menenius...
- Go, you that banish'd him!

901
01:24:54,499 --> 01:24:57,340
A mile before his tent fall down,

902
01:24:57,460 --> 01:24:59,844
and knee
The way into his mercy

903
01:25:23,496 --> 01:25:25,298
He would not seem to know me.

904
01:25:27,109 --> 01:25:29,412
I urged our old acquaintance,

905
01:25:29,532 --> 01:25:31,865
and the drops
That we have bled together.

906
01:25:32,294 --> 01:25:35,807
Coriolanus
He would not answer to

907
01:25:36,467 --> 01:25:37,969
forbad all names.

908
01:25:39,688 --> 01:25:40,406
He was a...

909
01:25:44,642 --> 01:25:46,436
kind of nothing,

910
01:25:52,056 --> 01:25:53,358
titleless,

911
01:25:55,486 --> 01:26:00,418
Till he had forged himself a name o' the fire
Of burning Rome.

912
01:26:03,042 --> 01:26:06,281
- if you refuse your aid...
-  if you would be your country's pleader,

913
01:26:06,401 --> 01:26:10,568
your good tongue more than the instant army we can make,
Might stop our countryman.

914
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:13,191
- No, I'll not meddle.
- Pray you, go to him.

915
01:26:13,311 --> 01:26:14,526
What should I do?

916
01:26:14,646 --> 01:26:18,075
Only make trial what your love can do
For Rome, towards Marcius.

917
01:26:18,195 --> 01:26:20,440
Well, and say that Marcius
Return me,

918
01:26:20,966 --> 01:26:24,969
as Titus is return'd,
Unheard; what then?

919
01:26:25,089 --> 01:26:27,714
Yet your good will
must have that thanks from Rome,

920
01:26:27,834 --> 01:26:32,229
You know the very road into his kindness,
And cannot lose your way.

921
01:26:41,249 --> 01:26:42,454
I'll undertake 't

922
01:26:47,995 --> 01:26:50,031
I think he'll hear me.

923
01:26:58,527 --> 01:27:00,504
He'll never hear him.

924
01:27:01,451 --> 01:27:02,294
No?

925
01:27:02,414 --> 01:27:04,772
I tell you, he does sit in gold,

926
01:27:05,746 --> 01:27:09,543
His eye red as 'twould burn Rome;

927
01:28:37,413 --> 01:28:42,270
The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy
particular prosperity,

928
01:28:44,164 --> 01:28:48,462
and love thee no worse than
thy old friend Menenius does!

929
01:28:51,895 --> 01:28:54,749
O Martius, Martius!

930
01:28:56,677 --> 01:28:58,713
thou art preparing fire for us.

931
01:29:00,115 --> 01:29:01,308
Look thee,

932
01:29:03,106 --> 01:29:05,059
Here's water to quench it.

933
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:12,875
I was hardly moved to come to thee
but being assured none but myself could move thee,

934
01:29:12,995 --> 01:29:15,810
I have been blown out of your gates with sighs.

935
01:29:17,796 --> 01:29:22,193
and conjure thee to pardon Rome,

936
01:29:27,861 --> 01:29:28,887
Away!

937
01:29:29,609 --> 01:29:30,218
HOW!

938
01:29:31,862 --> 01:29:32,788
Away!?

939
01:29:33,243 --> 01:29:37,382
Wife, mother, child, I know not.

940
01:29:37,957 --> 01:29:40,110
My affairs are servanted to others

941
01:29:40,230 --> 01:29:42,087
- sir...
- Therefore, be gone.

942
01:29:46,246 --> 01:29:49,175
Another word, Menenius,
I will not hear thee speak.

943
01:30:29,982 --> 01:30:33,678
This Marcius is grown
from man to dragon.

944
01:30:34,688 --> 01:30:36,491
He has wings;

945
01:30:38,343 --> 01:30:40,187
He's more than a
creeping thing.

946
01:30:55,164 --> 01:31:00,413
There is no more mercy
in him than there is milk in a male tiger.

947
01:32:54,628 --> 01:33:01,421
Coriolanus and Aufidius begin assault on Rome.

948
01:34:15,022 --> 01:34:16,608
My lord and husband!

949
01:34:17,442 --> 01:34:20,146
These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.

950
01:34:20,266 --> 01:34:23,542
The sorrow that delivers us thus changed
Makes you think so.

951
01:34:23,907 --> 01:34:25,793
Best of my flesh,

952
01:34:26,202 --> 01:34:27,770
Forgive my tyranny.

953
01:34:28,563 --> 01:34:32,569
but do not say
For that 'Forgive our Romans'.

954
01:34:46,521 --> 01:34:47,280
O, a kiss

955
01:34:49,333 --> 01:34:51,177
Long as my exile,

956
01:34:56,045 --> 01:34:59,191
Sweet as my revenge!

957
01:35:02,909 --> 01:35:04,744
You gods! I prate,

958
01:35:05,645 --> 01:35:08,966
And the most noble mother of the world
Leave unsaluted.

959
01:35:09,086 --> 01:35:11,235
Sink, my knee, i' the earth;

960
01:35:11,845 --> 01:35:13,681
O, stand up blest!

961
01:35:14,757 --> 01:35:19,581
Whilst, with no softer cushion than the flint,
I kneel before thee

962
01:35:19,701 --> 01:35:22,635
What is this? Your knees to me?

963
01:35:23,121 --> 01:35:25,127
To your corrected son?

964
01:35:25,247 --> 01:35:27,940
Thou art my warrior;
I holp to frame thee.

965
01:35:28,596 --> 01:35:31,016
This is a poor epitome of yours,

966
01:35:31,350 --> 01:35:35,188
Which by the interpretation of full time
May show like all yourself.

967
01:35:43,646 --> 01:35:47,309
The god of soldiers,
inform thy thoughts with nobleness

968
01:35:48,064 --> 01:35:50,985
that thou mayst prove
To shame unvulnerable,

969
01:35:52,345 --> 01:35:55,299
Your knee, sirrah.
Even he,

970
01:35:55,419 --> 01:36:00,124
your wife, this lady, and myself,
Are suitors to you.

971
01:36:00,244 --> 01:36:03,370
I beseech you, peace!
Or, if you'ld ask, remember this:

972
01:36:04,235 --> 01:36:09,296
Do not bid me dismiss  my soldiers,
or capitulate again with Rome's mechanics.

973
01:36:09,677 --> 01:36:11,972
Tell me not
Wherein I seem unnatural

974
01:36:12,418 --> 01:36:16,398
Desire not to ally my rages and revenges with
Your colder reasons.

975
01:36:17,304 --> 01:36:19,991
O, no more, no more!

976
01:36:20,475 --> 01:36:24,029
You have said you will not grant us any thing,

977
01:36:24,149 --> 01:36:28,408
For we have nothing else to ask, but that
Which you deny already: yet we will ask,

978
01:36:28,691 --> 01:36:33,813
That, if you fail in our request, the blame
May hang upon your hardness: therefore hear us.

979
01:36:33,933 --> 01:36:38,252
Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll
Hear nought from Rome in private.

980
01:36:47,202 --> 01:36:48,395
Your request?

981
01:37:15,061 --> 01:37:17,656
Should we be silent and not speak,

982
01:37:18,866 --> 01:37:23,590
our raiment and state of bodies would bewray what life
We have led since thy exile.

983
01:37:26,897 --> 01:37:29,092
Think!

984
01:37:29,618 --> 01:37:33,740
How more unfortunate than all living women
are we come hither

985
01:37:34,917 --> 01:37:39,352
since that thy sight which should
Make our eyes flow with joy,

986
01:37:40,103 --> 01:37:43,429
hearts dance with comforts,

987
01:37:45,325 --> 01:37:49,528
Constrains them weep and
shake with fear and sorrow

988
01:37:51,747 --> 01:37:54,802
Making the mother, wife and child to see

989
01:37:55,669 --> 01:37:59,996
The son, the husband and the father tearing
His country's bowels out.

990
01:38:01,896 --> 01:38:04,533
We must find
An evident calamity,

991
01:38:04,892 --> 01:38:07,170
though we had
Our wish, which side should win

992
01:38:07,375 --> 01:38:09,202
for either thou.

993
01:38:10,383 --> 01:38:15,865
Must, as a foreign recreant, be led
With manacles thorough our streets,

994
01:38:16,637 --> 01:38:20,009
or else triumphantly
tread on thy country's ruin,

995
01:38:20,284 --> 01:38:23,513
And bear the palm for having bravely shed

996
01:38:23,633 --> 01:38:26,008
Thy wife and children's blood.

997
01:38:31,590 --> 01:38:33,017
For myself,

998
01:38:34,953 --> 01:38:36,271
son,

999
01:38:37,423 --> 01:38:41,178
I purpose not to wait on fortune till
These wars determine.

1000
01:38:41,745 --> 01:38:46,610
if I cannot persuade thee rather to show
a noble grace to both parts than seek the end of one,

1001
01:38:46,918 --> 01:38:50,181
thou shalt no sooner
March to assault thy country

1002
01:38:50,473 --> 01:38:53,160
than to tread--on thy mother's womb,

1003
01:38:54,695 --> 01:38:58,070
- That brought thee to this world.
- Ay, and mine,

1004
01:38:58,270 --> 01:39:01,475
That brought you forth this boy, to keep your name
Living to time.

1005
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:06,783
A' shall not tread on me!

1006
01:39:07,434 --> 01:39:09,036
I'll run away till I am bigger,

1007
01:39:10,571 --> 01:39:11,765
but then I'll fight!

1008
01:39:14,114 --> 01:39:17,494
- I have sat too long.
- Nay, go not from us thus.

1009
01:39:18,762 --> 01:39:21,257
If it were so that our request did tend

1010
01:39:21,486 --> 01:39:26,772
To save the Romans, thereby to destroy
The Volsces whom you serve,

1011
01:39:27,056 --> 01:39:32,426
you might condemn us,
As poisonous of your honour, no

1012
01:39:33,012 --> 01:39:35,741
Our suit
Is that you reconcile them

1013
01:39:35,987 --> 01:39:39,491
So the Volsces
May say 'This mercy we have show'd

1014
01:39:39,708 --> 01:39:41,820
the Romans,
'This we received;'

1015
01:39:42,375 --> 01:39:48,567
and each in either side give the all-hail to thee and
cry 'Be blest for making up this peace!'

1016
01:39:56,216 --> 01:39:57,426
Speak to me, son

1017
01:40:00,572 --> 01:40:01,932
Why dost not speak?

1018
01:40:07,645 --> 01:40:09,890
Daughter, speak you

1019
01:40:10,340 --> 01:40:13,770
He cares not for your weeping.
Speak thou, boy

1020
01:40:14,396 --> 01:40:18,263
Perhaps thy childishness will move him more
Than can our reasons.

1021
01:40:18,383 --> 01:40:20,864
There's no man in the world
More bound to 's mother,

1022
01:40:20,984 --> 01:40:24,214
yet here he lets me prate
Like one i' the stocks.

1023
01:40:24,334 --> 01:40:29,224
Thou hast never in thy life
Show'd thy dear mother

1024
01:40:29,447 --> 01:40:33,177
any courtesy, When she, poor hen,
Has cluck'd thee to the wars,

1025
01:40:33,297 --> 01:40:35,288
and safely home,
Loaden with honour.

1026
01:40:36,103 --> 01:40:39,866
Say my request's unjust,
And spurn me back: but if it be not so,

1027
01:40:41,798 --> 01:40:43,650
Thou art not honest.

1028
01:40:44,869 --> 01:40:47,105
and the gods will plague thee,

1029
01:40:47,225 --> 01:40:52,153
That thou restrain'st from me the duty which
To a mother's part belongs.

1030
01:40:55,460 --> 01:40:58,381
Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.

1031
01:41:02,161 --> 01:41:03,305
Down!

1032
01:41:05,392 --> 01:41:07,312
This is the last!

1033
01:41:08,672 --> 01:41:09,673
pray.

1034
01:41:18,308 --> 01:41:22,402
so we will home to Rome,
And die among our neighbours.

1035
01:41:26,526 --> 01:41:27,369
Nay,

1036
01:41:29,156 --> 01:41:30,773
behold 's this boy,

1037
01:41:31,357 --> 01:41:33,329
that cannot tell what he would have

1038
01:41:34,685 --> 01:41:37,553
But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,

1039
01:41:38,255 --> 01:41:40,842
Does reason our petition with more strength

1040
01:41:40,962 --> 01:41:42,552
Than thou hast to deny 't.

1041
01:41:47,601 --> 01:41:49,187
Come, let us go.

1042
01:41:49,971 --> 01:41:53,826
This fellow had a Volscian to his mother,

1043
01:41:54,026 --> 01:41:56,221
His wife is in Corioli

1044
01:41:56,341 --> 01:41:58,494
and his child
Like him by chance.

1045
01:41:59,287 --> 01:42:00,889
Yet give us our dispatch.

1046
01:42:01,009 --> 01:42:05,504
I am hush'd until our city be a-fire,
And then I'll speak a little.

1047
01:42:23,014 --> 01:42:24,149
O mother,

1048
01:42:30,199 --> 01:42:31,459
mother!

1049
01:42:34,760 --> 01:42:36,266
What have you done?

1050
01:42:41,173 --> 01:42:42,312
Behold,

1051
01:42:47,105 --> 01:42:48,290
the heavens,

1052
01:42:48,941 --> 01:42:50,276
do ope,

1053
01:42:52,754 --> 01:42:54,941
The gods look down,

1054
01:42:59,056 --> 01:43:03,245
and this unnatural scene
They laugh at.

1055
01:43:09,497 --> 01:43:11,666
O my mother, mother!

1056
01:43:18,309 --> 01:43:19,778
O mother!

1057
01:43:24,930 --> 01:43:25,681
Ah!

1058
01:43:35,905 --> 01:43:37,174
You have won

1059
01:43:38,726 --> 01:43:42,447
a happy victory to Rome.

1060
01:43:45,220 --> 01:43:48,058
But, for your son,--believe it,

1061
01:43:50,211 --> 01:43:51,521
O, believe it!

1062
01:43:53,353 --> 01:43:54,363
Most,

1063
01:43:55,489 --> 01:43:58,063
Dangerously you have prevail'd with him,

1064
01:44:00,245 --> 01:44:02,607
If not most mortal to him.

1065
01:44:07,942 --> 01:44:09,336
But, let it come.

1066
01:44:13,408 --> 01:44:15,110
Aufidius,

1067
01:44:17,747 --> 01:44:22,249
though I cannot make true wars,
I'll frame convenient peace.

1068
01:44:24,029 --> 01:44:27,834
Now, good Aufidius, Were you in my stead,
would you have heard A mother less?

1069
01:44:28,359 --> 01:44:30,562
or granted less, Aufidius?

1070
01:44:31,655 --> 01:44:33,249
I was moved withal.

1071
01:44:34,129 --> 01:44:37,834
I dare be sworn you were!
And, sir, it is no little thing

1072
01:44:38,293 --> 01:44:40,654
to make
Mine eyes to sweat compassion.

1073
01:44:42,159 --> 01:44:44,329
But, good sir,
What peace you'll make,

1074
01:44:46,023 --> 01:44:47,258
advise me.

1075
01:45:35,605 --> 01:45:38,050
A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,

1076
01:45:38,321 --> 01:45:41,358
No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.

1077
01:45:41,608 --> 01:45:44,228
we have all Great cause

1078
01:45:44,679 --> 01:45:46,594
to give great thanks.

1079
01:45:47,679 --> 01:45:52,101
Behold our patroness, the life of Rome!

1080
01:46:05,165 --> 01:46:06,733
How is it with our general?

1081
01:46:06,853 --> 01:46:09,629
As with a man by his own charity slain.

1082
01:46:09,749 --> 01:46:13,014
His stoutness will remain uncertain whilst
'Twixt you there's difference.

1083
01:46:14,010 --> 01:46:16,676
but the fall of either
Makes the survivor heir of all.

1084
01:46:16,796 --> 01:46:17,602
I know it.

1085
01:46:18,926 --> 01:46:22,590
And my pretext to strike at him admits
A good construction.

1086
01:46:24,922 --> 01:46:26,353
I raised him,

1087
01:46:26,929 --> 01:46:29,874
and I pawn'd
Mine honour for his truth.

1088
01:46:29,994 --> 01:46:32,574
who being so heighten'd,

1089
01:46:32,694 --> 01:46:36,154
He water'd his new plants with dews of flattery,

1090
01:46:36,274 --> 01:46:38,218
Seducing so my friends.

1091
01:46:40,366 --> 01:46:43,545
at the last,
I seem'd his follower, not partner,

1092
01:46:44,267 --> 01:46:47,588
and he waged me with his countenance, as if
I had been mercenary.

1093
01:46:47,708 --> 01:46:50,555
So he did, my lord:
The army marvell'd at it,

1094
01:46:50,675 --> 01:46:53,159
and, in the last,
When he had carried Rome

1095
01:46:53,279 --> 01:46:55,485
and that we look'd
For no less spoil than glory...

1096
01:46:55,605 --> 01:46:56,918
There was it.

1097
01:46:57,579 --> 01:47:00,383
For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.

1098
01:47:02,661 --> 01:47:06,454
At a few drops of women's rheum,

1099
01:47:06,574 --> 01:47:08,458
which are
As cheap as lies,

1100
01:47:08,767 --> 01:47:13,265
he sold the blood and labour
Of our great action.

1101
01:47:15,965 --> 01:47:17,683
therefore shall he die

1102
01:47:20,379 --> 01:47:22,123
And I'll renew me in his fall.

1103
01:47:25,640 --> 01:47:27,668
'tseems he arrived !

1104
01:48:29,524 --> 01:48:31,869
I am return'd your soldier,

1105
01:48:32,874 --> 01:48:36,596
No more infected with my country's love
Than when I parted hence,

1106
01:48:36,863 --> 01:48:39,967
but still subsisting
Under your great command.

1107
01:48:41,002 --> 01:48:43,764
We have made peace
With no less honour to the Volscians

1108
01:48:43,884 --> 01:48:45,537
Than shame to the Romans.

1109
01:48:46,204 --> 01:48:49,404
Tell the traitor, in the high'st degree
He hath abused your powers.

1110
01:48:49,524 --> 01:48:51,766
Traitor? how now!

1111
01:48:51,886 --> 01:48:54,221
Ay, traitor, Marcius!

1112
01:48:54,341 --> 01:49:00,184
- Marcius?
- Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius!

1113
01:49:01,013 --> 01:49:05,887
Dost thou think I'll grace thee
with that robbery, thy stol'n name Coriolanus?

1114
01:49:07,113 --> 01:49:11,656
Perfidiously
He has betray'd your business,

1115
01:49:12,266 --> 01:49:18,490
and given up,
For certain drops of salt, your city Rome,

1116
01:49:18,610 --> 01:49:20,827
I say 'your city,'

1117
01:49:21,562 --> 01:49:24,366
to his wife and mother,

1118
01:49:24,950 --> 01:49:30,449
Breaking his oath and resolution like
A twist of rotten silk,

1119
01:49:31,212 --> 01:49:35,192
never admitting
Counsel o' the war, but at his nurse's tears.

1120
01:49:35,312 --> 01:49:38,444
He whined and roar'd away your victory,

1121
01:49:38,564 --> 01:49:40,196
Hear'st thou, Mars?

1122
01:49:40,316 --> 01:49:42,809
Name not the god, thou boy of tears!

1123
01:49:42,929 --> 01:49:48,231
Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart
Too great for what contains it.

1124
01:49:48,351 --> 01:49:51,424
Boy! O slave!

1125
01:49:52,100 --> 01:49:55,789
Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,

1126
01:49:56,689 --> 01:50:00,833
Stain all your edges on me. Boy!

1127
01:50:02,967 --> 01:50:05,320
If you have writ your annals true,

1128
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:08,624
'tis there,
That, like an eagle in a dove-cote,

1129
01:50:08,744 --> 01:50:12,264
I flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli:

1130
01:50:12,384 --> 01:50:16,964
Alone I did it. Boy!

1131
01:50:24,981 --> 01:50:25,982
Let him die for't.

1132
