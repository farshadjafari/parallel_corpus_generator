and want to say respectfully that king
heart is getting powerfull against mind

446
01:11:05,312 --> 01:11:08,611
what was a need of having
relationship with hindu princess

447
01:11:09,182 --> 01:11:11,952
that was deciousion of goverment mr. Mullana

448
01:11:11,952 --> 01:11:13,317
which will be in every one favour

449
01:11:14,054 --> 01:11:18,892
and which conatains every commen one favour
'should not be considerd in religious cube

450
01:11:18,892 --> 01:11:20,519
you are saying right

451
01:11:21,762 --> 01:11:25,596

01:33:43,645 --> 01:33:49,709
but today's chef is jodha queen herself
so she stared to eat food first.

593
01:33:54,722 --> 01:33:59,427
For the safty reasons to act upon the royal laws...

594
01:33:59,427 --> 01:34:03,420

746
01:55:52,939 --> 01:55:55,635
Elder respectfull mom told me about that

747
01:55:56,276 --> 01:55:59,871

748
01:56:00,280 --> 01:56:02,578
What should elder mother do against me?

749
01:56:03,083 --> 01:56:04,851

751
01:56:10,757 --> 01:56:19,799
Because which maha manga ask me to stay

now i'll not hear even one
word against elder mother

754
01:56:30,477 --> 01:56:38,316
just like you can'nt listen about maha manga 'i
too can not hear any thing without my fate and respect

755
01:56:44,057 --> 01:56:51,190
it was mistaken when walking on

759
01:57:13,687 --> 01:57:22,618
Because always love depends on trust '
that's why it is right that i should go!

760
01:57:23,129 --> 01:57:27,828
Quickly prepare to send queen

761
01:58:56,572 --> 01:59:02,977

762
01:59:03,179 --> 01:59:04,942
I was doing my duty?

763
01:59:05,381 --> 01:59:15,124

01:59:29,071 --> 01:59:31,232

771
01:59:48,524 --> 01:59:52,128

772
01:59:52,128 --> 01:59:55,393
I can't do this queen.

773
01:59:55,064 --> 01:59:55,996

and used letter in wrong sences.

784
02:01:00,362 --> 02:01:01,056
Oh god!

785
02:01:03,232 --> 02:01:04,859

Atleast you tried to know the situation.

833
02:10:00,102 --> 02:10:02,900
The problem is that you are far from the

you dont know how to
acchive peoples heart

835

879
02:20:31,165 --> 02:20:32,928
Flour seed?
1 gram of 2 coins!

880
02:20:34,235 --> 02:20:34,826
1 gram in 2 coins?

881
02:20:35,370 --> 02:20:39,238
We bought on this price from landlord...

882
02:20:39,841 --> 02:20:41,638
He has too high price!
It seems that you came from high place

883
02:20:46,811 --> 02:20:49,211
if you want to buy so buy it
or get lost!

884
02:20:49,847 --> 02:20:50,506
Nonsence

885
02:20:51,282 --> 02:20:52,476

886
02:20:53,051 --> 02:20:54,814
Talking to... get lost!

887
02:21:09,968 --> 02:21:11,993
Silence! Arrest him.

888
02:21:17,041 --> 02:21:17,439

889
02:21:19,911 --> 02:21:21,276

Thats what i want see!

892
02:21:27,218 --> 02:21:28,742
This is unfair of darogas

893
02:21:30,054 --> 02:21:30,952
he ruined us...

894
02:21:32,624 --> 02:21:33,784
but he is loyal servant of royal kingdom!

895
02:21:36,594 --> 02:21:36,889
Ohh man... you are newcomer?

896
02:21:38,896 --> 02:21:41,091
Iook... one more blind in the blind town!

897
02:21:41,599 --> 02:21:43,897
He's not seeing how much
foreigner are punishing us!

898
02:21:44,369 --> 02:21:48,931
Who foreigner? That turkey, irani,
afghani... they all are damn foriegner

899
02:21:49,440 --> 02:21:51,135
the castle of the king is full of foreigner!

900
02:21:52,810 --> 02:21:55,210
But i heard that the king is very kind
and good person!

901
02:21:56,447 --> 02:21:56,708
He is doing too much good activity for local people!

902
02:21:58,816 --> 02:22:00,443
So why dont you go to him for complain about him

903
02:22:01,019 --> 02:22:05,479
leave it dear... there is no one our...
who understand our problems

904
02:22:05,556 --> 02:22:09,322
and we will not belive that the king is indian... and
whether the king or other they all are foreigner

905
02:22:10,094 --> 02:22:16,624
perhaps you dont know that our king borned in
a hindu rajput family and grew up here!

906
02:22:17,135 --> 02:22:17,897
So how can he be a foreigner?

907
02:22:18,403 --> 02:22:20,530
He is indian too how much you are!
Really?

908
02:22:21,172 --> 02:22:23,367
If he's india so what he did
yet for local peoples?

909
02:22:26,210 --> 02:22:30,943
If this king is worried too much about peoples
so why he di'nt stop taking tax on tesri yatra

910
02:22:32,250 --> 02:22:32,909
tax on tesri yatra?

911
02:22:34,052 --> 02:22:36,316
It seems that you came newly in agra and
in this country too...

912
02:22:37,388 --> 02:22:40,255
we hindu always paid tax
on tesri yatra!

913
02:22:43,661 --> 02:22:45,424
Who is not worried who is fullfiled!

914
02:22:46,497 --> 02:22:48,158
Who's local people like us!

915
02:22:49,634 --> 02:22:52,797
Who cant endure that burden.

916
02:22:53,805 --> 02:22:56,501
But no gain...
no one will listen!

917
02:22:58,242 --> 02:22:59,072
Come on!

918
02:23:06,084 --> 02:23:08,575
Is that was right decision
to see the market?

919
02:23:09,654 --> 02:23:11,645
Atleast we understand that what is
thinking our fellow country mens

920
02:23:13,124 --> 02:23:14,148
what kind of tax on tesri yatra is?

921
02:23:17,028 --> 02:23:20,862
The hindu beliver goes to see thier god
on tesri yatra!

922
02:23:21,999 --> 02:23:24,991
In the exchange of they have to pay
tax to royal kingdom!

923
02:23:26,337 --> 02:23:29,864
Is they still paying us?
- Yes mylord!

924
02:23:30,575 --> 02:23:31,564
So why dont you stop it!

925
02:23:34,445 --> 02:23:35,434
This is extremly unfair!

926
02:23:36,547 --> 02:23:38,606
One who pay the money
to see his god!

927
02:23:39,550 --> 02:23:40,847
We had never think about it!

928
02:23:41,886 --> 02:23:47,756
This is receiving from decades.
How can we prepared.

929
02:24:08,045 --> 02:24:12,243
Attention peoples...
i want to annouce something important.

930
02:24:14,418 --> 02:24:17,683
After thinking alot and worry i felt that
to receive tax on tesri yatra is just...

931
02:24:19,090 --> 02:24:25,518
like to judge the greatness of god on
coins!

932
02:24:28,366 --> 02:24:35,636
So therfore i decided to remove the tax on
tesri yatra!

933
02:24:40,645 --> 02:24:44,046
Mylord... you thought very good...
i beg your pardon... i want to say something!

934
02:24:48,920 --> 02:24:50,353
Permission granted.

935
02:24:51,122 --> 02:25:00,497
How unfair is that... you forgot us...
we are also the member of royal castle

936
02:25:02,166 --> 02:25:06,626
in this royal kingdom we participate
to built this kingdom!

937
02:25:08,206 --> 02:25:09,969
We are consultant of yours mylord!

938
02:25:11,442 --> 02:25:13,672
This strange decision of yours

939
02:25:15,279 --> 02:25:17,873
why did'nt you discuss about it
before taking decision!

940
02:25:18,482 --> 02:25:21,383
We did'nt feel to dicuss this!

941
02:25:23,921 --> 02:25:29,655
To take intrest or not is
rights of kingdom...

942
02:25:31,362 --> 02:25:33,489
we are not going against the islam!

943
02:25:35,199 --> 02:25:36,496
This decision is goverment decision!

944
02:25:38,336 --> 02:25:38,995
Not religious!

945
02:25:40,404 --> 02:25:50,245
If this is government decision so
the treasure minister will not say

946
02:25:55,253 --> 02:25:58,814
mylord this decision will
effect on royal treasure.

947
02:25:59,590 --> 02:26:05,028
I wish to know what is royal treasure?

948
02:26:06,664 --> 02:26:08,859
What is this treasure

949
02:26:11,402 --> 02:26:16,772
we are not like others pirates

950
02:26:16,841 --> 02:26:19,366
who steal hindustan money.

951
02:26:21,279 --> 02:26:22,871
Who live in a love of money

952
02:26:24,548 --> 02:26:26,277

953
02:26:28,185 --> 02:26:30,312

and because of this i love my country fellow mens
without seeing their religion

955
02:26:44,235 --> 02:26:46,567

no noise at the time of pick it up

957
02:26:49,540 --> 02:26:53,499

wrong decision in sentimental mood.

958
02:26:58,282 --> 02:27:00,876

Means... that ifjalaludin could survive
so the revenge of attempting murder...

986
02:38:28,739 --> 02:38:30,673
the government will never spare them.

987
02:38:32,809 --> 02:38:37,872
If he cant survive... so the afghan and
forigener will never spare that chance.

988
02:38:39,049 --> 02:38:45,318
You are absolutely right rana sahib.
Wisdom is that safe yourself.

989
02:38:46,590 --> 02:38:50,651

996
02:40:49,122 --> 02:40:50,384

998
02:41:10,677 --> 02:41:14,773

1040
02:46:52,285 --> 02:46:54,378
But this message can not passed to him

The bloodshed will stop by running on this way!

1105
02:56:08,285 --> 02:56:12,881
I am sorry to say mylord... but you are forgetting that...
shariffudin is very strong by body and he is fighter

1107
02:56:17,027 --> 02:56:18,324
He is too strong

1108
02:56:19,897 --> 02:56:21,421
but i cant let the india
go on the wrong hands!

1109
03:01:49,292 --> 03:01:51,260
Shariffuddin!

1110
03:01:53,830 --> 03:01:59,166
If you wer'nt husband of bano so
this sword were in your body yet!

1111
03:02:05,041 --> 03:02:09,239
Just foresake her i forgive you!

1112
03:02:22,225 --> 03:02:24,284
I am taking back all your
province from you!

1113
03:02:29,466 --> 03:02:33,027
Now you cant take decision
in matter of kingdom!

1114
03:02:34,771 --> 03:02:35,260

1115
03:02:38,175 --> 03:02:42,168

anybudy!

1120
03:03:45,141 --> 03:03:51,239
We being a muslim... a muslim...
always we loved the other religion!

1121
03:03:55,552 --> 03:03:57,281
The peoples of our kingdom
are independend...

1122
03:03:59,389 --> 03:04:01,414
because they can belive
here religion and respect.

1123
03:04:05,228 --> 03:04:06,024
But alas!

1124
03:04:07,964 --> 03:04:09,397
That you cant understand me!

1125
03:04:13,503 --> 03:04:21,877
And this is my wish that you on the way
of god travel to the macca sharif!

1126
03:04:41,631 --> 03:04:45,829
And now i request to the rajput queen of india
that come near to me!

1127
03:04:54,978 --> 03:04:57,879
I am telling this last time to the presented
peoples of castle and the whole kingdom!

1128
03:05:01,017 --> 03:05:05,283
That queen jodha is hindu
rajput... and my wife!

1129
03:05:06,856 --> 03:05:08,483
And also queen of india!

1130
03:05:10,327 --> 03:05:13,262
To go against her is like going against kingdom!

1131
03:05:17,934 --> 03:05:27,502
Keep remember my words that to respect all religion
and to passion of endure will make next india goldenbird!

1132
03:05:29,512 --> 03:05:30,342
Ameen!

1133
03:05:36,019 --> 03:05:39,147
Is that enough for today khan?
Just pray for you safety!

1134
03:05:41,191 --> 03:05:47,494
This was the story ofjodha akbar!
There is no example of there love!

1135
03:05:49,199 --> 03:05:50,359
Or no one remmember there love

1136
03:05:52,435 --> 03:05:55,871
perhaps the history did not give it value!

1137
03:05:57,407 --> 03:06:05,507
But the truth is that the jodha
akbar made the history silencely
