1
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,600
Thanks.

2
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,600
- Is it OK if I smoke?
- Sure.

3
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
My matches are all wet. You got a lighter?

4
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,600
Yeah. It's here somewhere.
It's my wife's car.

5
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,500
There we are.

6
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:27,200
<i>I remember going on a school trip</i>
<i>to the top of the Empire State Building.</i>

7
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,100
<i>When I looked down at the people</i>
<i>on the street, they looked like ants.</i>

8
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,100
<i>I pulled out a penny. Some of us started</i>
<i>talking about what would happen</i>

9
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,100
<i>if I dropped it from up there</i>
<i>and it landed on somebody's head.</i>

10
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,400
<i>Of course I never crossed that line</i>
<i>and actually dropped the penny.</i>

11
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,500
<i>I don't think Early Grayce</i>
<i>even knew there was a line to cross.</i>

12
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,600
I mean the mind of a serial killer
as it relates to culpability.

13
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,400
Someone who can't distinguish
between right and wrong is like a child.

14
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,900
In law, he should be treated like a child.
He should not be in prison, or executed.

15
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,500
There you go again.

16
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,200
Next comes the part where
you blame misfiring synapses,

17
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,900
amok biochemicals
and horrendous childhoods.

18
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,900
It's a fact. Most of these people
have severe chemical brain imbalances.

19
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,900
Think I put enough tequila in?
The answer is research and treatment

20
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,300
under hospital conditions.
Not the electric chair.

21
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,800
That's great, Brian. Unless it's your
mother's head they find in the refrigerator.

22
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,000
But executing the killer
would not bring my mother back.

23
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,800
- Thank God.
- Oh, everybody's a joker.

24
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,000
But it'd sure make you feel a lot better.

25
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,800
No, actually it wouldn't
make me feel any better.

26
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,300
Brian, the bottom line is
these people are evil, plain and simple.

27
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,300
How 'bout a bowl of chili? A hot one.

28
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,800
Be right there!

29
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,300
Antichrist would be a woman

30
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,600
in a man's body,
with seven heads and seven tails.

31
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,900
Make that to go.

32
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,700
Antichrist would be a woman

33
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,000
in a man's body.

34
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,000
Seven heads and seven tails.

35
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,900
Antichrist would be a woman

36
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,400
in a man's body.

37
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:46,500
Seven heads and seven tails.

38
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,200
Yeah!

39
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,900
<i>I always knew I'd be a writer,</i>

40
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,300
<i>but there's a big difference between</i>
<i>writing a magazine article and a book.</i>

41
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,200
<i>I know. I wrote a magazine article.</i>

42
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,000
<i>Everything I ever wanted to know about</i>
<i>serial killers fit nicely on the four pages.</i>

43
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,200
Brian, what are we doing here?

44
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,400
Research. Come on, look at this place.
You'll get some great photos in here.

45
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,200
This is where her nightmares began.

46
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,000
Her father worked the night shift here.
Most nights, he'd take her with him.

47
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,200
She was 11 years old.

48
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,600
Of course, the bastard knew
that nobody could hear her screams

49
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,400
over the noise of the machines.

50
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,800
<i>The article got me a book deal.</i>
<i>A little cash up front.</i>

51
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,900
<i>But, between the rent and the convertible,</i>
<i>the advance was gone.</i>

52
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,700
<i>I owed a book and I was stuck.</i>

53
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,600
<i>What little I knew about serial killers</i>
<i>I'd learned in a university library.</i>

54
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:13,700
<i>The only thing I knew for certain was that</i>
<i>people didn't kill each other in libraries.</i>

55
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,400
She murdered her first victim over here.

56
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,200
They found him stuffed in the corner.

57
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,900
They found her second victim over there.

58
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,100
Can you imagine the rage and pain
she must have felt returning to this place?

59
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,100
The victim returns
to the scene of the crime

60
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,200
and becomes the criminal.

61
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,900
Where did everybody go?

62
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,400
I didn't take that long.

63
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,300
Size seven.

64
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,200
That's right, ain't it? Super size seven.

65
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,800
Oh, Early, you're a specialist.

66
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:31,500
- Happy birthday, Adele.
- Thank you, honey. These are beautiful.

67
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:37,500
This reminds me of Cinderella when
the prince gave her his glass slipper.

68
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:41,600
Except these ones are red
and they ain't see-through.

69
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,400
And there's two of 'em. Is that my chili?

70
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,300
Oh, honey.

71
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,000
Happy birthday to me. Thank you.

72
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,900
Tonight turned out to be interesting, uh?

73
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,600
Those fascinating friends of yours
and their stimulating conversation?

74
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,800
No, the warehouse. I'm not that stoned.

75
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,700
Oh, the warehouse.
Actually, yeah, it was pretty interesting.

76
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,900
It was definitely the highlight
of the evening.

77
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:24,200
You know, just bein' there where it
all really happened. I could almost...

78
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,400
Take your shirt off.

79
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,000
Yes, ma'am.

80
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,000
Come here.

81
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,400
Early!

82
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,000
What?

83
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,700
I'll be waitin' for you when you get back.

84
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,900
Put your titty back up, Adele.

85
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,800
Oh, wait, I forgot.
Mr. Diebold stopped by yesterday.

86
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,200
He said if we don't pay him
by the end of the month,

87
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,300
he's gonna kick us
the F-U-C-K outta here.

88
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,000
He said that to you? Cussed at you?

89
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,200
- You gonna talk to him?
- Well...

90
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,400
Shut up!

91
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,000
If he comes back here,
don't you open that door.

92
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,700
Suppose he hears me inside?

93
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,000
I picked up some Chinese.
Did you hear from the gallery?

94
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,900
Have you got your slides back?

95
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,200
What'd they say?

96
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,500
Oh, well, you know.
Same story, different day.

97
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,500
They're idiots.

98
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,100
Too graphic. Too overt.

99
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,200
Not suitable for mass consumption.
I forget what...

100
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,900
You don't wanna be suitable
for mass consumption.

101
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,000
I know.

102
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,800
It's just...

103
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,900
Who cares anyway, right?

104
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,100
Not me.

105
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,500
Christ, I'm dying here, Brian.

106
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,400
Why can't we get out of here?
Why can't we just get the hell out of here?

107
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,400
Why can't we just go to California?
Why not?

108
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,900
- Just like that?
- Yeah. Just like that.

109
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,800
<i>What the hell did I know about California?</i>

110
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,800
<i>For some people, it was still</i>
<i>a place of hopes and dreams.</i>

111
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,000
<i>A chance to start over.</i>

112
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,700
<i>The idea was, if you could just get there,</i>
<i>everything would be OK.</i>

113
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:07,900
<i>And if it wasn't OK there, well, then it</i>
<i>probably wasn't gonna be OK anywhere.</i>

114
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,800
Adele! Whose car is that out front?

115
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,000
She's not here.

116
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,300
Shit.

117
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,700
Well, look who stopped by.

118
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:34,100
And I ain't supposed to be at the parole
office till tomorrow. Two o'clock.

119
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,100
You know, Early, you're supposed
to notify me when you lose your job.

120
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,400
Yep.

121
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,400
I stopped by the mirror factory today.

122
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:52,200
- You left quite a mess behind there.
- That wasn't my fault.

123
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,400
It's dangerous there
and they treat me like shit.

124
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,200
Nobody ever has treated you right,
have they, Early?

125
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,800
Your daddy was pickin' on you
when he threw you outta the house

126
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,900
for stealin' the tires off his truck.

127
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,300
The police were way outta line when they

128
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,200
kept you from beatin'
that bartender half to death.

129
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:23,300
You know, Early, I bet the Lord's gonna
be pickin' on you come Judgment Day.

130
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,100
Now, hold on there.
I ain't got nothin' against God, see?

131
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,600
It's just the people he let get in there.

132
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,200
What you lookin' for?

133
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:40,400
That girlfriend of yours.
Not much for housekeepin', is she?

134
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,900
Well, we's thinkin'
about movin', anyhows.

135
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,500
Maybe down to Texas.
Get me a job in one of them offshore rigs.

136
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,900
What are you talkin' about?

137
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,600
Well...

138
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,100
- You know you can't leave the state.
- Yeah, it's just...

139
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,900
What you can do is get a job.

140
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,400
You be at this address.
Three o'clock sharp.

141
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,500
What is it?

142
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,900
Janitor's job.

143
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,500
Well, don't wanna be no janitor.

144
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,100
I don't give two shits
what you want and what you don't want.

145
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:27,200
I'm tellin' you to be there. Or you
gonna be havin' dinner with the sheriff.

146
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,400
You understand me, boy?

147
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,500
You oughta try puttin' a bag
over your head for that cough.

148
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,000
Works every time.

149
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,900
Peg-armed piece of shit.

150
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:52,900
<i>She came back to the warehouse</i>
<i>that her father molested her in.</i>

151
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,600
<i>Why? Because this place is the catalyst.</i>

152
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:02,100
<i>She needed to relive her own nightmares</i>
<i>before she could kill those men.</i>

153
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
How are you, Sleeping Beauty?

154
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,600
- I didn't have the heart to wake you.
- Thanks.

155
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,900
My head.

156
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,700
- What are you doin'?
- I sat down with your photos,

157
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,000
- which are wonderful...
- Thank you.

158
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,600
...and my tapes, and I started writing.

159
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,500
- How's it goin'?
- It's the best stuff I've ever done.

160
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,000
- And I think I know why.
- Why?

161
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,600
Because, for the first time, I understood
that woman as a human being.

162
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,900
I was walking where she walked,
where she killed.

163
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,300
I was in her skin,
looking through her eyes.

164
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,800
I think we got a book here,
with your pictures and my writing.

165
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,200
- It's a book.
- A book on the warehouse murders?

166
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,600
No, on some of the most infamous
murders in American history.

167
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,400
I wanna go to where they lived
and where they killed.

168
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,200
I want you to take the pictures.
I'll write the text.

169
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,500
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about this.

170
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,800
We can go through Tennessee.

171
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,600
We could drop through Arkansas...
wherever the hell Arkansas is.

172
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,300
There it is.
Then we can drop down into Texas,

173
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,200
and from there
it's a straight shot right into...

174
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,900
California.

175
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,000
We don't stop till
we hit the fucking ocean.

176
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,900
Thank you.

177
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:23,200
We don't have enough money,
but we'll figure something out, right?

178
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,300
- Hold on a minute there, boy.
- Shit!

179
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,200
Goddammit, you're gonna
settle that rent here and now.

180
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,100
I'm tired of your bullshit, boy.
I want my money!

181
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,700
Dipshit.

182
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,200
You son of a bitch. Come back here!

183
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,400
That's it. Tell him I want you both the fuck
outta here by Sunday or I'll call the police.

184
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,400
Elvis, get the fuck off of him.

185
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,100
<i>The ride share was my idea.</i>

186
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,500
<i>I thought if we found somebody</i>
<i>who wanted to go to California,</i>

187
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,300
<i>they'd help pay for the gas.</i>

188
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,100
<i>Carrie wasn't crazy about the idea,</i>

189
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,400
<i>but the Lincoln only</i>
<i>got eight miles a gallon.</i>

190
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:19,100
- They say one day the whole thing...
- Is gonna slide right in the ocean.

191
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,400
"Need somebody to share turns
at the wheel and expenses

192
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,600
on a week-long, cross-country
tour of historic murder sites"?

193
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,500
You've gotta be kidding.

194
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,200
Who in their right mind
is gonna want to do that?

195
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,700
- I would.
- Like I said...

196
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,900
Hey, good luck on that thesis.

197
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,400
Don't know where
the personal office is at, do you?

198
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,800
Personnel office is...
first door on the left.

199
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,400
What, down there?

200
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,600
Stinking bitch.

201
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,800
Shit.

202
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,800
Early!

203
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,500
- How ya doin', momma?
- Fine.

204
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,900
Boy, I'm tired. Dinner ready yet?

205
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,400
Almost.

206
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,500
Well, let me know.

207
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,900
- Early.
- Yeah?

208
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
- Will you tell me more about California?
- Yeah, I guess so.

209
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,000
Let's see.

210
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,500
One thing, people think faster out there
on account of all that warm weather.

211
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,500
Cold weather make people stupid,
that's a fact.

212
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,900
That explains why there's
so many stupid people round here.

213
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,000
It sure does. You know what else?

214
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,600
You never have to buy no fruit
on account it's all on the trees.

215
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,400
And they ain't got no speed limits.

216
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,600
I hear your first month's rent
is free - state law.

217
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,700
So till we get settled, we'll just
move around from month to month.

218
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,900
How'd that be with you, momma?

219
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,300
What are we gonna do out there, Early?

220
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,000
The first thing is get us a couple of
six-packs of Lucky Lager

221
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:27,500
and climb up to that famous Hollywood
sign. We're gonna howl at the moon.

222
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,800
Yeah, just like that.

223
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,000
I heard once that there
ain't nothin' on that ol' moon

224
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:41,700
except some little golf balls
the astronauts left behind.

225
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,700
Nah, that ain't right. That's bullshit.

226
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,700
The government be sendin' people there
all the time. Just don't want us to know.

227
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,300
Now, git.

228
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,100
Well, let me know when you're finished.

229
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,200
Shit!

230
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,800
So what'd he sound like over the phone?

231
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
He was real polite.
He kept calling me "sir".

232
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,300
- I like that.
- Yeah, I'll bet you do.

233
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,600
You should try it once in a while.

234
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,800
I don't know. This is really weird.
We should have at least met them first.

235
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:47,700
Beggars can't be choosers. They were the
only ones to answer the ride-share note.

236
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,800
Oh, God. Please don't let them
be as boring as Brian's friends.

237
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,200
Anything but that.

238
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,500
Early, we shouldn't be doin' this.

239
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,100
You know you ain't even allowed
to be leaving the state.

240
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,500
And these people are strangers.

241
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:17,300
What kind of people would stop at places
where other people got murdered?

242
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,800
What if these people
are dangerous, Early?

243
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:25,000
- They ain't dangerous, they're writers.
- Honey... Early Grayce!

244
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,600
- Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?
- Yeah, I did.

245
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,900
I left him with the car.

246
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,200
We're all straight now.

247
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,800
- What is that?
- That's Lucy.

248
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:45,600
Adele, what kind of cuckoo-brain
carries a cactus in her purse?

249
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,800
I don't know.

250
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,900
Straighten up.

251
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,800
Oh, Brian. You've got to be kidding me.
They look like Okies.

252
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,400
Oh, Jesus, they look kinda weird.

253
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,900
- They can't have $5 between them.
- Smile. Let me do the talkin'.

254
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,000
- Let's keep goin'.
- Lighten up.

255
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,100
- How many times you gonna say that?
- As many times as it takes.

256
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,400
Lighten up.

257
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,400
- Early?
- Mr. Kessler?

258
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,900
Hi, I'm Brian Kessler. Nice to meet you.

259
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,800
- You must be Adele.
- Yeah.

260
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,900
- That's Adele.
- Nice to meet you.

261
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Hi.

262
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,900
- Can I help you with your luggage?
- Oh, yeah.

263
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,000
- I'll get these.
- OK.

264
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,100
- Hi, I'm Adele.
- Hi, I'm Carrie.

265
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,400
- Oh, I like your hair.
- Oh. Thanks.

266
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,700
Cos it... it's short.

267
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,600
Oh, yeah. Well... Thanks.

268
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,800
<i>Carrie was right. If you looked in</i>
<i>the dictionary under "poor white trash",</i>

269
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,800
<i>a picture of Early and Adele</i>
<i>would have been there.</i>

270
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,200
<i>But I knew if I was gonna</i>
<i>be a good writer,</i>

271
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,400
<i>I'd have to ignore the clichés</i>

272
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,200
<i>and look at life through my own eyes.</i>

273
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,600
- So, Early.
- Yep.

274
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:40,500
- What do you do?
- Well, I do some work at the...

275
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,300
Well, I did some work
at the mirror factory.

276
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:47,200
Know what, Brian? One night
when we was stayin' up late,

277
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,100
we was talkin' about
how much bad luck

278
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,100
he must have coming
from all those mirrors he broke.

279
00:24:53,400 --> 00:25:00,100
And I swear we came to 449 years that
it would take for him to work it all off.

280
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,400
And he'd have to - after he died,

281
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:07,500
he's gonna have to keep comin' back
to earth over and over and over again.

282
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,300
Karma.

283
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,000
- What?
- Karma.

284
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,800
You know, when you do
something bad to someone,

285
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,300
and fate pays you back
by something bad happening to you?

286
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,600
Is that French?

287
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:29,000
We could stop somewhere
if you haven't had breakfast.

288
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,500
It's like this, Brian. I don't eat breakfast.

289
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,100
It's because of what
he read in this book once, Brian.

290
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:40,300
That folks needin' breakfast
is a myth or somethin',

291
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,300
and it was put out by the cereal people.

292
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,600
- Jesus Christ!
- Who are you?

293
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,400
His parole officer.

294
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,800
Oh, right. Talked to you on the phone.

295
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,600
- What the hell happened?
- They say it's a torch job.

296
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,600
- That sound like your boy?
- Yeah, could be.

297
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,900
- Where would I find him?
- I don't know.

298
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:19,600
Crazy son of a bitch was talkin' about
movin' down to Texas.

299
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,900
Without his car?

300
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,300
What about the owner of the house,
this... Mr. John Diebold?

301
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,300
- You know where he might be at?
- I don't know.

302
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,200
I tell you what. He's not gonna be
too happy when he sees this.

303
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,100
Jesus Christ!

304
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:45,000
<i>Early seemed harmless.</i>
<i>Primitive, but harmless.</i>

305
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,000
<i>The fact was that he'd killed his landlord</i>
<i>less than an hour before we met him.</i>

306
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,600
<i>He was even wearing the guy's ring.</i>

307
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,900
<i>Who knows what he did with the finger?</i>

308
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,200
Here you go, momma.

309
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,000
- Oh, thank you, honey.
- Yeah.

310
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,200
Look what I got! I got a camera.

311
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,500
Who gets the water?

312
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,900
Here you go, Bri.
I got chips and some jerky here.

313
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,300
If you want 'em, just holler.

314
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,200
Just in case.

315
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,900
<i>From the moment I began</i>
<i>working on the book,</i>

316
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,300
<i>I found myself asking</i>
<i>one question over and over.</i>

317
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,600
<i>What's the difference</i>
<i>between a killer and any one of us?</i>

318
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,800
<i>What was it they had - or didn't have -</i>

319
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,700
<i>that separated them from us?</i>

320
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,200
The Novaks are long gone.

321
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,400
But the white picket fence
they hired Michael Zeruba to put up

322
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,600
is still here.

323
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,500
- The Novaks...
- Hey, you two.

324
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,600
Come on, show your love.

325
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,700
The Novaks embraced the young drifter
as one of their own.

326
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,500
The neighbors said
he was a quiet young man

327
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:00,700
who was often seen pushing
the children on the swing set.

328
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:04,800
Everything was fine until the day
the Novaks ran out of work for Michael

329
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,500
and had to ask him to leave.

330
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:13,000
How does a man get to the point where
he can kill a human being in cold blood?

331
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,300
Early, could you move
out of the way, please?

332
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,500
The first to die
was the nine-year-old daughter.

333
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:36,300
Hi, I'm Brian Kessler. What's your name?

334
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,000
Pa!

335
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,300
Pa, where are you?

336
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:53,800
Pa! There's somebody at the door
who wants to see you.

337
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,000
- What? Who is it?
- I don't know.

338
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,600
Afternoon, sir. I'm sorry to wake you.

339
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,800
My name is Brian Kessler.

340
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,300
I'm a writer.

341
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:11,400
I'm workin' on a book on some of
the famous murders in American history.

342
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,300
I'm sure you're aware
that this is the Novak farm.

343
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:19,500
I was wondering if my girlfriend Carrie
could come in and take a few pictures?

344
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:24,000
I'll walk around, tape some notes and
we'll be out of your hair in five minutes.

345
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,800
I'd like to maybe just walk around
the house and get a feel for it.

346
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,700
Goddamn ghouls.

347
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:34,200
We drove all day to get here, sir.
I'd be out of your hair in five minutes, sir.

348
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,600
Five minutes.

349
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,800
Brian, come on.

350
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,400
Let's forget about it. Come on.

351
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:54,600
<i>At the time, I was angry that</i>
<i>Mr. Baxter slammed the door in my face.</i>

352
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,000
<i>But it was just his way of forgetting,</i>

353
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:01,300
<i>of pretending that nothing terrible</i>
<i>had ever happened there.</i>

354
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,700
<i>I guess it's only natural to try</i>
<i>and forget the bad things that happen.</i>

355
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
<i>You never really do, though.</i>

356
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,600
We've come 480 miles so far.

357
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,900
- Not bad for a day's haul, huh?
- Pretty good.

358
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,800
You got any family or friends
in California, Early?

359
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,500
- No. Do you? You do?
- No, I don't.

360
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,500
Do you have any friends or family
in California, Carrie?

361
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,300
What? No.

362
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,200
Well, that's OK.
At least we all got each other, right?

363
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:02,200
I mean, that's somethin'.

364
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,400
My momma used to say that
when you have people around you,

365
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,500
it's better that you're not by yourself,
because when you're alone

366
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,900
it's hard to develop your personality.

367
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:22,300
With more people around you, it helps,
cos friends are really important and...

368
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,100
- Thank you.
- Thanks, bro.

369
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,100
We'll get the next one.
We gotta hit the sack.

370
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,800
Let's go, momma.

371
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,100
- Have sweet dreams.
- Night, Adele.

372
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,400
Night, Early.

373
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,300
That's funny.
I didn't know you were so prejudiced.

374
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,600
Because I object to having
somebody take off their shoe

375
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:55,900
and scratch their foot
while I'm eating... I'm prejudiced?

376
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,600
He can't help the way he was raised.
I kinda feel sorry for him.

377
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,800
You feel sorry for him. That's so sweet.

378
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,100
Obviously you didn't get
a whiff of that sock.

379
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,200
Bitch, bitch, bitch.

380
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,800
30 bucks for a motel. For what?

381
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,300
A lumpy mattress, a crummy TV
and a crapper? Don't think so.

382
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:29,100
- Honey, sing me a song.
- I'm busy, momma. Just stay put.

383
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,500
Please?

384
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,700
OK, if you don't sing it,
I'm gonna sing it myself.

385
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,500
# Do your balls hang low?
Do they wobble to and fro?

386
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,800
# Can you tie 'em in a knot?
Can you tie 'em in a bow?

387
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,500
# And put 'em over your shoulder
Like a continental soldier?

388
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:54,700
# Do your balls hang low?
Do your balls hang low?

389
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:00,700
Honey, when we get to California, will
you take me to that Chinese restaurant

390
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,800
where all them footprints are out in front?

391
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,600
Only if they let me put mine down, too.

392
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,700
Pretty smooth how they stiffed us
on dinner, though.

393
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:21,000
He didn't stiff us.
He paid for the gas, remember?

394
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:26,600
Brian, I am telling you
they're almost broke

395
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:30,000
and we are gonna end up
paying for the two of them.

396
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,600
Don't change the subject.

397
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,200
It is my favorite subject, though.

398
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,500
- Morning.
- Morning, Early.

399
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,400
- Breakfast?
- No, I don't eat breakfast. Never do.

400
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:35,100
Sir? We don't have a liquor license,
so I'm afraid you're gonna have to...

401
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:39,200
That's OK. I got plenty more
where this 'un come from.

402
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,900
- Morning.
- Morning, Adele.

403
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,600
You cut your hair.

404
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,600
Early cut it.
He said it makes me look more pretty.

405
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,700
And I think he's right

406
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,300
cos... he's right.

407
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,100
Nice job, Early.

408
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,800
You like to order some breakfast?

409
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,000
No, I won't be having breakfast
this mornin', thank you.

410
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,500
Want some of this?

411
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,500
- Finish.
- Thanks.

412
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:40,000
What you readin'?

413
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:44,200
- <i>Sex, Art, and American Culture.</i>
- No, I never read that.

414
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,900
I can't wait to get on the road.
I love that convertible.

415
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,000
- Yeah, it's great.
- Cos...

416
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,700
I like wind, Brian.

417
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,500
So do I.

418
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:37,300
- You want me to get your stuff?
- No. Thanks, Early, I can manage.

419
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,400
I meant to say luggage. Ma'am.

420
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,100
I got 'em.

421
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:09,000
- Hi, honey.
- Momma.

422
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,500
<i>When you dream, there are no rules.</i>

423
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,900
<i>People can fly. Anything can happen.</i>

424
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,000
<i>Sometimes there's a moment</i>
<i>as you're waking</i>

425
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,400
<i>and you become aware</i>
<i>of the real world around you,</i>

426
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,700
<i>but you're still dreaming.</i>

427
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
<i>You may think you can fly,</i>
<i>but you better not try it.</i>

428
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,400
<i>Serial killers live</i>
<i>their whole lives in that place,</i>

429
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,600
<i>somewhere between dreams and reality.</i>

430
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,900
Guess it's your turn to pay, Early.

431
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,700
Hey, move it.

432
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,100
Stupid son of a bitch.

433
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:15,400
You know, I used to smoke
before I met Early.

434
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,700
But he broke me of that.

435
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,300
- Broke you?
- Oh. Yeah.

436
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:27,100
Cos Early, he don't think that women
should smoke or drink or cuss.

437
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,500
So you know what I do?

438
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,200
I spell all my cuss words.

439
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,000
S...

440
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,300
S-H...

441
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,000
S-H-I-T!

442
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,600
But you don't do
any of those other things?

443
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:32,600
No. I mean, I better not.

444
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:12,800
- He whips you?
- No, no, no. Only when I deserve it.

445
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,300
- You were in there a long time.
- Yeah, I took a dump.

446
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,900
You don't wanna go in there.
Wall-to-wall stink.

447
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,900
- Just goin' in to wash my hands.
- Ain't got no sink.

448
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,100
- No sink?
- No. Damnedest thing I ever seen.

449
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,300
Let's go.

450
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,600
How 'bout I drive, bud?

451
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:33,300
- No, momma. Get in the back.
- $28.35, sir.

452
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,800
- How much?
- $28.35.

453
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,400
There. Hope I got that.

454
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,500
Make it an even 30.

455
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,700
- Thank you, sir.
- Yeah.

456
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:10,000
<i>When you first meet people, all you notice</i>
<i>is the differences between you and them.</i>

457
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,900
<i>But, as time passes,</i>
<i>you start noticing the similarities.</i>

458
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,200
<i>I guess that's how all friendships begin.</i>

459
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:22,000
OK, so you first. You put down
a card, and then I put down a card.

460
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:25,900
Then when they match up
and it's the same card,

461
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,400
then you go "snap" and I take it.

462
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:32,200
And I take the cards
that's there and... like that.

463
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,500
Snap.

464
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:43,700
I thought you said
you never played this before.

465
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:48,200
I haven't. I really haven't.
I'm a fast learner, I guess.

466
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:52,800
I was reading in your deal there how
they never caught that Black Dolly killer.

467
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:54,700
- Black Dahlia.
- Yeah.

468
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:58,100
- They didn't.
- Well, I was wonderin' how come.

469
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,600
See what I'm gettin' at? It's like "Hmm."

470
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:07,100
Well, some people think he just stopped
killing and disappeared back into society.

471
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:12,300
That's fine and dandy, but I wanna know
what a smart fella like yourself thinks.

472
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,800
I always thought
it was the work of a serial killer.

473
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,400
Anybody who took that much care
bisecting another human being...

474
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:21,000
- Bisecting?
- He cut 'em in two.

475
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,200
- He hacked 'em up?
- In two pieces, yeah. In half.

476
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,500
Anybody who did that
must have enjoyed it.

477
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:31,300
He would have done it again and again
and again until somebody stopped him.

478
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:34,800
That's good. That's a good theory, Bri.

479
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,000
You wanna hear mine?

480
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:44,700
- Sure.
- OK.

481
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:48,400
Ain't you gonna record it?

482
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:57,400
Early Grayce's Black Dahlia theory.

483
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:59,700
June 23rd.

484
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,800
OK. Now, I'm bettin' he's still alive.

485
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:08,900
Real old, livin' in a trailer park
or somethin', somewheres.

486
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:11,100
But he's alive, see.

487
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:16,300
Now, he's thinkin' about what he done,

488
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,900
goin' over it and over it and over it
in his head, every night,

489
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:22,700
thinkin' how smart he is
for gettin' away with it.

490
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,800
- That's possible.
- You shoot pool?

491
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:37,100
Come on, bud.

492
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:40,500
Designated driver.

493
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,700
Minnesota Fats.

494
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,100
- Don't forget your key.
- Why'd I open my big mouth?

495
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:54,700
Please come home soon.

496
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,300
Let's go!

497
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:03,600
Jesus, bud,
you damn near swallowed her!

498
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,500
So why didn't you go with them, Adele?

499
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:23,100
Cos, you know how Early feels
about women drinkin'.

500
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,600
So how did you and Early
meet, anyways?

501
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:33,300
I was hitchhikin' this one day.

502
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,200
And Early stopped.

503
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:40,100
And I walked up to look in the window.

504
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:46,800
And I looked in, and Early's face,
he was down like that cos he was serious.

505
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:50,600
And then he said "You gettin' in?"

506
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:02,500
And then he looked up
and that's when I saw his eyes.

507
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,700
And I swear, Carrie,
he has the eyes of an angel.

508
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:13,300
And then, I ended up
movin' in his trailer with him,

509
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,800
cos I thought it'd be kinda neat.

510
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:19,200
But...

511
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:27,200
Know what? I was thinkin' that
what if me, you and Brian and Early

512
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:30,900
all moved into a house
together in California?

513
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:33,000
Wouldn't that be fun?

514
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:37,000
Well, I mean...

515
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,900
Well, we'll see what happens.

516
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,600
- You never know.
- OK.

517
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,400
Do you want me to fix your hair for you?

518
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,400
Yes.

519
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:06,900
Cos... I don't really like it. That much.

520
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:10,600
Come on, then.

521
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,800
- OK.
- It doesn't look that bad, but...

522
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,700
I think we should fix it.

523
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:29,100
I'm bettin' we gonna find us
some doors round here.

524
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:33,400
- Yeah, the door's out front, on the street.
- Not doors.

525
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,700
Not doors, bud.

526
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:40,100
Openings to other dimensions.

527
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:45,400
See - I read, bud.

528
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:49,100
And I'm tellin' you,
if a man knows what he's doin',

529
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:53,200
he can transport himself to
anywhere in this goddamn universe.

530
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:56,100
Didn't know that, did you?

531
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,500
No, I didn't. Think I should tell you
I'm not much of a pool player.

532
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,800
Oh, it ain't hard. I can teach you.

533
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:06,100
- Really?
- Yeah.

534
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:08,500
I'll spot you a few balls.

535
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:11,700
- You're not gonna hustle me, are you?
- How much money you got?

536
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,600
What's that?

537
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:24,000
That's a portfolio of my work.
That's what that is.

538
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,400
Your pictures? Can I look at 'em?

539
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,300
Yup, go right ahead.

540
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,400
Oh, my Lord!

541
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,400
- Did you take this one?
- I took all of those.

542
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,800
- That one's me.
- No, it isn't.

543
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:56,100
- Hold still, you.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

544
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,700
My God, Carrie.

545
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:06,700
If Early ever saw me in a picture like that,
I'd be black-and-blue for a week.

546
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,800
You shouldn't let him do that to you.

547
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
You think Early's mean to me?

548
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,500
Well, he's not.

549
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,300
He may punish me once in a while, but...

550
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,100
he's not mean.

551
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:48,500
When I was 13...

552
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,300
there were these three boys.

553
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:57,800
They raped me in the back of this truck.

554
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,200
They hurt me so bad,

555
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:12,400
I was in the hospital for,
like, four months.

556
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:19,500
And I feel safe with Early, cos

557
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,400
most of the time he treats me really nice.

558
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,600
I know that he'd never...

559
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:33,300
He would never let anything like that
ever happen to me again.

560
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:43,500
I like my hair.
You did a really good job, Carrie.

561
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:48,400
It's really professional.

562
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,600
Hey, Marlene! Come here, baby.

563
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:01,500
Why don't you and me get together
tonight and sweat it up some?

564
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:04,900
Fuck off, TJ.

565
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,800
There you go. That'll be five bucks.

566
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:22,900
Wait. Wait a minute.
These aren't Lucky Lager.

567
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:26,100
- We ordered Lucky Lager.
- Take a look around you.

568
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,800
If you see somethin' lucky around here,
you let me know.

569
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,700
Why don't you tell me
what you think is so funny?

570
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:41,000
- What?
- Do you think I'm funny?

571
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,100
No.

572
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,400
What would a jizz-garglin',
cum-drunk fairy like you

573
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:48,400
do with a pretty girl like that, anyway?

574
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:52,300
- What are you talkin' about, man? Relax.
- Hit him, Bri, cos it's comin'.

575
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:58,000
- What was that? Is this your boyfriend?
- No, he's not my boyfriend. Just cool it.

576
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,800
- Hey, asshole.
- This ain't Lucky Lager.

577
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,300
Break it up!

578
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:16,100
It wasn't that guy's fault. TJ started it.

579
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,200
Dipshit.

580
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,300
Rack 'em up.

581
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:41,600
# Cos your pink replaces your red

582
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:47,300
- My mom was a beautician.
- Really?

583
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,800
Yeah. She likes pink a lot.

584
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:54,200
You should have seen her face.

585
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:58,700
She was mad when she first
found out I was with Early,

586
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:02,500
on account of him
just gettin' out of jail an' all.

587
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:07,400
She hasn't talked to me
in over a year now.

588
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,700
I wish she'd call me, Carrie.

589
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,900
Early's been in jail?

590
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:24,200
What for?

591
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,300
For carryin' a gun.

592
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:32,600
And resistin' arrest.

593
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:36,300
It's a really interesting story, actually.

594
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:40,400
He put up a fight with the policeman

595
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:44,500
and they struggled because
he didn't wanna be arrested.

596
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,500
I'd have done the same thing.

597
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,900
Why aren't you laughin' now?

598
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:56,200
I don't know. I just don't think that

599
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,700
carrying guns and resisting
arrest is very funny.

600
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:14,800
Well... I'm gonna go back
to my hotel room now, Carrie.

601
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,300
I had a really great time with you.

602
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:29,600
I just think I had too many beers.

603
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:36,500
And I wasn't even supposed
to be drinkin' in the first place!

604
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:39,500
Adele, you don't have to go.
I didn't mean...

605
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,300
Great.

606
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,100
Look at this dipshit.

607
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,600
Hey, watch it, asshole!

608
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:58,300
Get him, Bri. Tear him up.

609
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,500
Oh, I gotta see a man about a mule.

610
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:04,100
What?

611
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:06,300
Take a piss.

612
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:11,300
Hey, see if there's any reebs
in the back seat.

613
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:14,400
- What?
- Reebs. Beers.

614
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:18,400
It's what we used to call 'em
when we were kids.

615
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:21,600
It's beer spelt backwards.

616
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:25,300
Shit! Think I chipped the concrete, Bri.

617
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,700
The last one. I want you to have it

618
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,200
- for saving my ass.
- Don't want it. Take it.

619
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,500
It ain't nothin'. I picked
that big Yankee mother years ago.

620
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,900
But I'm not a mother and you are.

621
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:39,600
Come on!

622
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,600
Thank you.

623
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,100
How long you had your woman, bud?

624
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:50,600
- Three years.
- Yeah? She's a good one.

625
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:53,400
She's a breeder, you dog.

626
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:58,200
I'll tell her you said she's a breeder.
She'll like that. I'll tell her you said that.

627
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:00,400
Can I get that, bud?

628
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:15,500
Do you remember them doors?
Them doors I was talkin' about, Bri?

629
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:23,700
I got me a couple.
I found me a couple of 'em in Kentucky.

630
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,800
Hell, I wasn't even lookin'
for the first 'un.

631
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:32,000
I was on the side of the road
swingin' my sickle.

632
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:39,300
I turn around and there's this door.
This big ol' door.

633
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:44,300
And light's comin' out,
blinding me, real gold.

634
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,600
And I'm thinkin', this can't be.

635
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:49,200
So, I close my eyes.

636
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:52,500
And I count one,
I count two, I count three,

637
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,800
I count four, five.

638
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,300
And I open my eyes.

639
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:02,200
It wasn't there.

640
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,900
Come on.

641
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,200
Am I late?

642
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,300
Sorry.

643
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:39,200
Early and me,
we got into a fight in this bar.

644
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,800
I'm fine, though.

645
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,900
It was me and him against like, 30 guys.

646
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:48,200
You and I, we gotta talk
about your good buddy Early.

647
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:50,700
Who said he's my good buddy?

648
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:53,500
You sure been actin' like you were.

649
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:57,600
- Out whoopin' it up and drinkin'.
- You been drinkin', too. Come on.

650
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,700
Oh yeah, right.

651
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:03,900
You should have seen how scared
she was that he was gonna find out.

652
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,400
- He beats her, you know.
- How do you know that?

653
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:12,100
Because she told me.
That's how I know that.

654
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:16,900
I gotta see a man about a mule.

655
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,600
But only when she deserves it!

656
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,400
Do you happen to know
that he was in jail?

657
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:29,800
Yeah. For stealing a car.

658
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:34,300
Really? Is that what he told you?

659
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,700
He told her it was for carrying a gun.

660
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:40,600
Brian, it could be for murder
for all we know.

661
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:45,400
Will you stop being
so fucking melodramatic?

662
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:47,700
Melodramatic?

663
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:53,600
If it was murder... he'd still be in jail.

664
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:57,500
Or he'd be on parole.

665
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:01,600
In which case, he wouldn't
be allowed to leave the state.

666
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:06,900
Maybe he wasn't allowed to leave the
state. Ever stop to think about that?

667
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:13,500
OK, we'll get the keys, we'll get the
car and sneak out. Is that what you want?

668
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:18,100
- What is the matter with you?
- Can we talk about this in the morning?

669
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:25,300
So how are you feelin' now, Brian?

670
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:32,200
Does your stomach feel kinda like
it's in these knots and it's twisty

671
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:35,600
and you could just explode
at any given moment?

672
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,200
Well...

673
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:42,200
My daddy, he used to make
this great drink for hangovers.

674
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:45,800
And he'd make a blend of
sauerkraut juice and Tabasco sauce...

675
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:48,000
Goddamn! You see that woman?

676
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
She's butt ugly.

677
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:55,200
And he'd put in a little bit of lemon.
For the tartness.

678
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:59,500
And then the last ingredient -
this is the best one - was an egg,

679
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:04,900
so that he could have breakfast and get
rid of his hangover all in the same time.

680
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:08,100
Shave that dog and teach it to hunt!

681
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:12,600
<i>Early lived in the moment.</i>

682
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:15,700
<i>He did whatever he wanted,</i>
<i>whenever he wanted.</i>

683
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
<i>It was that simple.</i>

684
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:23,200
<i>I don't know if I was fascinated</i>
<i>or frightened by him.</i>

685
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,600
<i>Probably both.</i>

686
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:29,300
OK. What shall I call you?

687
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:33,500
I can't call you Lucy. Lucy's gone.

688
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,600
I'll call you Shelly.

689
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:39,400
Hi, Shelly. I know you're thirsty.

690
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:46,200
What? What's goin' on?

691
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,800
- Look.
- What?

692
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:49,800
Look!

693
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:20,900
Only thing my ol' man ever gimme
was this goddamn .45.

694
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:25,200
Japanese, but it's pretty good.

695
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:27,600
- Go on, shoot it.
- No, I never did this.

696
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:30,300
- I don't know how to do it.
- Yeah, you can do it.

697
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:33,400
- I haven't...
- Point and shoot the damn thing.

698
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:39,100
No, bud, you're jerkin' it.
You're all like this.

699
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:43,800
You gotta hold it soft -
like your pecker. OK?

700
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:46,500
Boys'll be boys.

701
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:52,600
- You know any tricks, Carrie?
- No.

702
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:54,300
Now hold on. Hold on.

703
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:57,400
- You wanna learn some?
- No.

704
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:59,900
OK, loosen up. Loosen your elbow.

705
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:04,200
Breathe. You gotta breathe, bud.
Hold it.

706
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,000
Shoot.

707
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,700
- Hey, Carrie...
- Good one.

708
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,300
- You look good with a gun, Brian.
- Good one, bud. Super. Good one.

709
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:17,800
You like that gun? I'm gonna give
it to you. I want you to have it.

710
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,800
- I don't need a gun.
- No, go on. Take it.

711
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:23,000
I'll get me another one.

712
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:27,700
You never know out in California - all
them cuckoo-heads. You best hold onto it.

713
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:30,700
Now, give it another shot,
you mean boy. Go on.

714
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,900
Shoot that damn thing.

715
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:39,500
That's super.
That's some super shootin'. Look at that.

716
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:10,000
Lewiston Abattoir Mt. Juliet, Texas

717
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:17,000
Think we're gonna sit this one out, bud,
if that's to your satisfication.

718
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,300
Fine.

719
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,300
You need some help, bud, just holler.
I'll be there.

720
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:59,100
Shit.

721
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:46,000
- What is that?
- A copy of the tape they found.

722
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,500
He recorded everything.

723
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
<i>Mister, can you help me?</i>

724
01:07:56,200 --> 01:08:01,700
His mother had him workin' in here
before he was eight years old.

725
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:06,000
Killing animals with a sledgehammer
that was bigger than he was.

726
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:11,100
<i>Look. Can you get me</i>
<i>out of here, please?</i>

727
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:17,300
<i>Look. I don't know who you are.</i>
<i>I don't know what you want with me, but</i>

728
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,700
<i>please, just let me go, OK?</i>

729
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:23,000
When she was pissed at him...

730
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:26,200
<i>What are you doing?</i>

731
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:28,700
...she'd beat the shit out of him,

732
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,600
then lock him in here overnight.

733
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:38,300
<i>My parents, they have money. I can</i>
<i>give you money if that's what you want.</i>

734
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:41,000
- <i>Please! Please let me go.</i>
- One morning,

735
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:46,900
the little boy wakes up,

736
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,100
picks up his sledgehammer...

737
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:53,800
- <i>What are you gonna do with those?</i>
- ...starts hurting back.

738
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:07,300
How does he get from...

739
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:10,600
- What are you doing?
- I'm finished.

740
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:16,500
- I know you're upset about the gun.
- I am not upset about the gun!

741
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:20,800
Yeah, I'm upset about the gun,
but that is not it. It's...

742
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:24,800
God, can we please turn this off!

743
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:32,000
Goddammit, what is going on here?

744
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,600
A week ago you would never
have picked up that gun. Never!

745
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:42,900
And this afternoon you're wielding it
like you're Clyde fucking Barrow.

746
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:45,600
What is going on with you?
Please talk to me.

747
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:49,800
It was stupid. It was a cheap thrill.
I admit it, it was stupid.

748
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,800
It was just bang bang, like kids.

749
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:55,000
OK?

750
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:59,300
But I need you to take these photos.
We need them. I don't wanna blow it.

751
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:05,200
Oh, the pictures. The book. God, that
really is all that matters to you, isn't it?

752
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,800
That really is all you care about, isn't it?

753
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:12,300
God, I cannot believe I agreed to do this.

754
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:15,000
That is such crap.

755
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:19,600
You know you wanted to take these
photos just as much as I wanted you to.

756
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,900
Wrong.

757
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:25,800
Wrong. I was willing to do whatever
it took to get you off of your ass

758
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:30,400
and us on our way to California,
and there's a big difference.

759
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,900
- Early...
- What?

760
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:00,500
- Jesus Christ.
- Sorry.

761
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:05,100
I want him out of our car.

762
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:09,700
- Why? What happened?
- I want him out of our car.

763
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,900
- What happened?
- Next gas station it's either him or me.

764

766
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:52,500
Can I get a carton of Victory Kings
and $20 worth of gas in the car. Thanks.

767
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:57,000
Here's your change.

768
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:01,800
Looks like a bad one's coming in.
Y'all better be careful.

769
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,100
Where you headed?

770
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:06,300
California.

771
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:11,000
California. I hear it never rains out there.
Must be nice.

772
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:54,800
Hi, Carrie. I have to go to the bathroom.

773

783
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:57,000
I knew that boy would
have a hog leg here somewhere.

784
01:14:57,300 --> 01:14:59,600
Not a word.

785
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:05,900
Hello. Get over here, skinny.
Sit your ass in that corner.

786
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,400
Come on!

787
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:18,400
- Honey, what are you doing?
- They gave us the boot, momma.

788
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:21,200
Keep Brian busy.
I don't want him comin' in.

789
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:23,700
- You're scaring...
- Not now. Git!

790
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:36,100
Hi.

791
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:39,800
I'm just gettin' my things
and then I'm gonna leave, Brian.

792
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:44,500
- What's your name, boy?
- Walter Livesy.

793
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:49,200
Well, I think I gotta kill you, Walter.
How you feel about that?

794
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:52,900
Not so good.

795
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:55,700
- Are you sure you have to?
- Don't know. Wish I did.

796
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:58,300
- Early, please be...
- Shut up!

797
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:04,000
Goddammit! I'm trying to have
a conversation with Walter.

798
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,900
Sorry about that, Walter.

799
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:11,600
Hey, don't forget your yo-yo.

800
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:17,700
Adele, you leaving has nothing to do with
you guys. It's between Carrie and me.

801
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:21,100
Where you from?

802
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:25,800
- Vernon. Florida.
- Don't know it. Any huntin'?

803
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:30,600
Turkeys sometimes.

804
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:34,600
Yeah, turkeys are real smart.
Smarter than most people think.

805
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:40,000
Tell you what, Walter.
I want you down on your belly.

806
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:42,000
Get on your belly.

807
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:46,500
I want you to stay there
for a long time after we leave.

808
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:48,700
- We got a deal, son?
- Yeah. Yes, sir.

809
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,800
OK.

810
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,200
You mind if I hold onto
that Bible over there?

811
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,700
What do you want with a Bible, Walter?

812
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:59,400
He thinks I'm gonna kill him.

813
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:01,900
- Now that'd make me a liar, wouldn't it?
- No, sir.

814
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:04,200
No?

815
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:10,300
There you go, Walter.

816
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:17,800
I wonder if Adele might want it.

817
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:24,700
- What was that?
- Oh, my God.

818
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Nothin', Brian. Just the thunder.

819
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:36,500
- Hey, Early! What the fuck are you doing?
- You're gonna like this one, Brian.

820
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:40,200
Get in there. Get over there.
Adele, you're drivin'.

821
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:43,000
- What are you doin'?
- Come on. Let's go.

822
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:52,000
- You all right? What happened?
- Get us out of here, momma.

823
01:17:58,100 --> 01:18:02,400
- What happened?
- He shot him in the head. He shot him.

824
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:05,000
No, he didn't.

825
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:12,100
Everybody just shut up.

826
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:16,600
Goddamn squawkin' hen.
Nothin's changed.

827
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:20,100
I'm gonna get you there,
safe, to California,

828
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:23,700
if Adele don't kill us with her drivin' first!

829
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,900
What'd you get us?

830
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,900
I got Chinese food.

831
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:56,300
What is it?

832
01:18:56,500 --> 01:19:00,800
The guy, he didn't speak too good
English, Early, so I just got what they had.

833
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:03,300
Smells like butt. Did you get the beer?

834
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:08,300
What is it, Chink beer?

835
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:10,500
Goddammit, Adele.

836
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:17,000
Well... give this one to whatshername.

837
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:19,700
Come over here, bud. Get you some grub.

838
01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:24,200
What the hell's a Chinaman doin' in the
middle of an American desert anyhow?

839
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,900
Adele, where are the forks and spoons?

840
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:40,100
Is it just me, or has this trip gone downhill
since we ran out of Lucky Lager?

841
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:49,000
Wish I had me some chili beans.

842
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,600
How many people have you killed, Early?

843
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:08,400
Well, now, how many people
you seen me kill, Bri?

844
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:12,800
- None.
- That's how many I killed.

845
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:20,100
- If you say so.
- Damn right I do.

846
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:23,300
Shut up! Eat your food.

847
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:33,800
You ain't never killed no one,
have you, Bri?

848
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,000
- No.
- No. Ain't seen nobody killed, have you?

849
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:43,300
- No, I haven't.
- No.

850
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:48,000
Tell me somethin'.
How you gonna write a book

851
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:51,200
about somethin'
you don't know nothin' about?

852
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:57,100
Momma, sing us a song or... somethin'.

853
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:10,800
# I

854
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,900
# Wish

855
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:18,900
# Carrie was happy

856
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,700
# I

857
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:24,900
# Wish

858
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:30,100
# She would smile

859
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,300
You guys want your picture taken?

860
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:52,300
Come on, Carrie, smile.

861
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,000
He was breathin'
when I walked out of there.

862
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:11,900
See, Carrie, it's OK. He was breathin'.

863
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:16,500
Ain't we gettin' near
the next murder site, Bri?

864
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:20,400
- Forget it. It doesn't matter anymore.
- Hell if it don't.

865
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,700
Gimme that map.

866
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:28,400
Someday, me and Adele,
we'll be walkin' along,

867
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:31,000
see your book in some store window.

868
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:35,200
We're gonna buy it and put it on our
coffee table, ain't that right, momma?

869
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:40,100
Davidson Mine Dew Cove, Nevada

870
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,300
OK, let's go have us a look, people.

871
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:55,100
- Early, I'm just gonna stay here.
- You don't wanna go, momma?

872
01:22:55,700 --> 01:22:57,200
No?

873
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:03,300
All right, you watch Carrie.
I'll take the pictures, Bri.

874
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:15,300
You run and Bri gets it. Karma.

875
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,300
Lead the way, bud.

876
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:53,700
So what happened here?

877
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:58,000
Two brothers, prospectors,
lived here in the '70s.

878
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:01,400
Yeah, so?

879
01:24:01,700 --> 01:24:05,300
They picked up hitchhikers,
young men, and brought 'em back here.

880
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:11,300
Hey, Bri. This ain't gonna
give me nightmares, now, is it?

881
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:13,500
Wait. Get out of the way.

882
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,600
This one's called "Walk the Dog".

883
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:28,800
My favorite one is "Rock the Cradle".

884
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:41,500
They were asked just before they
were executed why they did it.

885
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:43,700
And they said "To be famous."

886
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:47,300
Why did you do it, Early?

887
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:51,600
Do what, Bri?

888
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:54,900
You didn't have to kill
the gas station attendant.

889
01:24:55,100 --> 01:24:57,100
Move a little to the left.

890
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:04,500
You wanted to. Why?

891
01:25:08,300 --> 01:25:12,000
Help me out, Early. You're right.
I don't know shit about killing.

892
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:15,100
You gotta tell me.

893
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:18,300
Does it make you feel good?

894
01:25:21,900 --> 01:25:23,600
Powerful?

895
01:25:23,900 --> 01:25:26,300
Superior?

896
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:30,400
What? Who are you angry with?

897
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:35,800
Your mother? Your father?

898
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,700
You wanna know
about my daddy? Do you?

899
01:25:41,900 --> 01:25:45,600
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah. I'll tell ya about my daddy.

900
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:50,800
Adele, you gotta help us out of here.
You gotta talk to Early because he's sick.

901
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:55,400
- He needs some sort of help...
- Carrie, you're messin' up my trick.

902
01:25:55,700 --> 01:25:57,600
Adele, listen to me, please.

903
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:02,800
Adele! The police are after him.
He killed a man back there.

904
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:05,100
No, Carrie, that ain't true.

905
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:07,300
I saw him kill a man!

906
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:10,000
No, Carrie, that ain't true.

907
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:14,000
Adele, come on. I'm your friend.
Why would I lie about this?

908
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:17,800
Why the hell would I lie about this?
I know you know!

909
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:21,600
- Why are you saying these things?
- Why would I lie?

910
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:27,900
He said he didn't do it,
and you ain't my friend!

911
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:32,400
You're on private property, ladies.
I'd like to see some identification.

912
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:35,900
No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Carrie.
Please don't say anything.

913
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:39,900
- We got a match. I'll call for backup.
- Please, please don't say anything.

914
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:44,100
All right, ladies, I'd like both of you
to step slowly away from the car.

915
01:26:54,700 --> 01:26:56,400
Brian!

916
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:01,300
Early!

917
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:03,800
<i>Confirm your location, over.</i>

918
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:06,100
No, Early...

919
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:15,800
Got 'em both on the dead run.

920
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:26,200
Come on, momma.

921
01:27:28,900 --> 01:27:30,800
Tell me that don't hurt.

922
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:34,300
- Here.
- What?

923
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:39,200
Gotta put that crippled dog
out of his misery.

924
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:44,700
You wanna know about it,
you gotta do it, son.

925
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:48,300
Shoot him. Come on, lay it on in there.

926
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:51,700
Come on, mean boy.

927
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:54,500
Come on, mean boy. Do it!

928
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:58,000
Shoot him! Shoot the dog.

929
01:27:59,300 --> 01:28:02,400
Time to live, boy. Shoot him.

930
01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:07,300
Come on. Go! Go, mean boy.

931
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:14,900
- You faggot.
- Look at his face. It's not your father.

932
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:17,200
- Look at him!
- I know that, you idiot.

933
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:21,000
That's police in a world of hurtin'.
This here's a mercy killin'.

934
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:31,600
Let's hit the road.

935
01:28:42,100 --> 01:28:45,300
You've not even said thank you.

936
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,300
Thank you.

937
01:28:49,300 --> 01:28:51,200
Thank you for what, Adele?

938
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:55,700
I don't know, Early.

939
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,500
Well, Adele, it's for saving
your fuckin' life back there!

940
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:03,200
Goddamn! You were this close
from spending the night in the county...

941
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:06,800
- You murdering son of a bitch.
- Stop it, Carrie.

942
01:29:07,100 --> 01:29:09,200
- Are you fucking insane?
- Shut up!

943
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:11,300
- He's a monster!
- Shut up, Carrie!

944
01:29:16,900 --> 01:29:19,600
Goddamn! Bunch of loons.

945
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,700
Look, momma. There's a pretty house.

946
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:45,400
Maybe they got some beer.

947
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:51,600
Look at all the cactuses.

948
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:56,100
They're beautiful.

949
01:29:56,900 --> 01:29:59,300
You know what makes
cactuses so strong?

950
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:04,600
You could just leave 'em and forget
about 'em forever and they'd still live.

951
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:06,500
They keep growin' and...

952
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:10,400
We gotta do somethin'
before Early kills somebody else.

953
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:13,600
- And they breathe.
- Adele! Will you listen to me?

954
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:20,500
You can't do nothin', Brian. Just sit still.

955
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:47,700
You have beautiful cactuses, ma'am.

956
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:53,000
I just love them.

957
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:56,600
My momma had a garden.

958
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:59,700
And I had this little baby cactus.

959
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:03,400
- I was gonna take it and plant it...
- You gotta talk to Adele.

960
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:05,700
She looks up to you. She'll listen to you.

961
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:09,100
I tried talking to her at the mine.
It didn't work.

962
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:14,000
- Try again.
- Hey, Bri. Did you ever stop...

963
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:19,100
Stop and think if you switched
two letters in your name,

964
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:22,100
it'd spell "brain"?

965
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Boy, you got a problem.

966
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:37,300
Goddammit.
What's wrong with Grandma?

967
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:52,400
Where's your husband?

968
01:31:55,700 --> 01:31:57,200
I'm a widow.

969
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,600
Yeah?

970
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:26,300
That you, Peaches?

971
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:30,200
Sweetheart, hey. Come on over here.

972
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:32,600
It's so clear you can't believe it.

973
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:46,100
It's just amazing.

974
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:48,700
Come on over and look.
Take a look, honey.

975
01:32:58,300 --> 01:33:00,800
I want you to see this, Peaches.

976
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:21,700
Guess what, Early?

977
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:25,800
Miss Musgrave,
she has this guesthouse in the back

978
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:28,500
and it's really beautiful.

979
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:32,300
And it's empty, hon. She said
if me and you wanted to, honey...

980
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:34,500
Hank!

981
01:33:40,700 --> 01:33:43,900
Well... you're a widow now, Peaches.

982
01:33:47,100 --> 01:33:48,600
Boring.

983
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:50,800
Boring.

984
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:55,800
Dogshit.

985
01:33:56,300 --> 01:33:59,600
That don't leave much
to the imagination, now, does it?

986
01:34:00,700 --> 01:34:02,600
Boring.

987
01:34:29,300 --> 01:34:31,800
I know him. That's my daddy.

988
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,600
Fucker.

989
01:34:35,700 --> 01:34:37,500
Boring.

990
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:44,900
You're not gonna die.

991
01:34:56,100 --> 01:34:58,100
That's you, ain't it?

992
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:07,700
Yeah, that's me. Do you like it?
What do you think?

993
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:25,600
Dogshit.

994
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:28,900
You can go now.

995
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:41,600
Call me.

996
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:44,900
You ought to control your woman, boy.

997
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:48,500
Stinking. Stinking.

998
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:51,800
Lucky for you
they take all kinds in California.

999
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:55,400
That's where we'll be tomorrow.

1000
01:35:57,100 --> 01:35:59,000
California.

1001
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:09,700
Don't be stupid.

1002
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:16,800
Goddammit!

1003
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:20,300
Peaches!

1004
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:28,700
Stop! Stop it, Early.

1005
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:31,800
Stop it.

1006
01:36:33,900 --> 01:36:36,700
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna get the piano up.

1007
01:36:36,900 --> 01:36:38,500
Try and slide your hands under.

1008
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:42,100
Momma? What are you...?

1009
01:36:43,300 --> 01:36:45,600
What are you cryin' for?
I'm the one who got hit.

1010
01:36:51,100 --> 01:36:53,900
Cos I decided, Early,

1011
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:59,100
I'm not gonna climb up
that Hollywood sign with you.

1012
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:01,900
- And why not?
- You're mean, Early.

1013
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:06,800
- No, I'm not.
- You hurt those people, Early.

1014
01:37:07,300 --> 01:37:10,000
I don't wanna do it with you.

1015
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:12,200
I loved you, Early.

1016
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:14,800
You just be quiet. You are mean.

1017
01:37:29,900 --> 01:37:31,200
Run. Go!

1018
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:34,400
No, I'm not leaving you here. Wait.

1019
01:37:35,700 --> 01:37:37,700
Go!

1020
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:44,900
- Adele!
- Shut up!

1021
01:38:01,300 --> 01:38:04,500
Looks like I need me a new woman.

1022
01:38:06,100 --> 01:38:08,600
- No! Not him.
- Shut up.

1023
01:38:09,700 --> 01:38:11,700
Jesus! No!

1024
01:38:11,900 --> 01:38:15,000
Oh, God, Early, I'll do anything.
I'll go with you. Please.

1025
01:38:15,300 --> 01:38:18,200
Please don't kill him.
Oh, God, I'll do anything.

1026
01:38:19,700 --> 01:38:21,400
Please don't kill him!

1027
01:38:44,900 --> 01:38:49,600
Oh, momma, we gotta find us a door.
Save us some time.

1028
01:38:49,900 --> 01:38:51,900
Goddamn, that's a super dress.

1029
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:55,100
Yeah, that's just super.

1030
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:02,300
Shit.

1031
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:20,200
Oh. I didn't think he left anyone alive.

1032
01:40:21,500 --> 01:40:24,400
- Where's Carrie?
- They took off down the road.

1033
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Watch your head.

1034
01:40:31,700 --> 01:40:33,700
Grab that chair.

1035
01:40:34,700 --> 01:40:37,300
I'm gonna lift the piano. Slide it under.

1036
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:56,400
He pulled out all the phone lines.
The nearest one is 21 miles away.

1037
01:40:58,700 --> 01:41:02,700
- He took the fire road west.
- Take your car and get to that phone.

1038
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:04,900
Call the police.

1039
01:41:56,900 --> 01:41:59,200
Well, how y'all doin'?

1040
01:41:59,500 --> 01:42:03,000
I'm Early. This is my woman, Carrie.

1041
01:42:04,100 --> 01:42:09,200
Sorry to inconvenience y'all like this,
but looks like we'll be stayin' the night.

1042
01:42:09,900 --> 01:42:14,000
Don't you move!
You Pinocchio-lookin' knuckleheads.

1043
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:30,500
No!

1044
01:46:01,300 --> 01:46:07,400
Dreamland Nuclear Test Range
California-Nevada Border

1045
01:46:39,300 --> 01:46:41,600
Door. Who would it be?

1046
01:47:15,400 --> 01:47:17,600
Carrie!

1047
01:47:46,200 --> 01:47:47,900
Motherfucker!

1048
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
Bri came back.

1049
01:48:13,700 --> 01:48:17,300
Hey, Bri.
You wanna ask me some questions?

1050
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:27,800
Ask me some questions. Come on.

1051
01:48:29,400 --> 01:48:34,400
Do I feel powerful? Do I feel superior? No.

1052
01:48:39,800 --> 01:48:41,500
No.

1053
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:44,300
I feel good.

1054
01:48:47,300 --> 01:48:50,000
Bri, you're bleedin'.

1055
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:54,400
Bri. You're bleedin'!

1056
01:48:56,900 --> 01:49:01,300
# Cos I'm as free as a bird

1057
01:49:02,200 --> 01:49:04,200
Skynyrd, man!

1058
01:49:04,300 --> 01:49:08,500
Lynyrd Skynyrd. I like that one.

1059
01:49:39,400 --> 01:49:41,200
The keys.

1060
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:44,600
They're around his neck.

1061
01:50:53,700 --> 01:50:57,100
<i>I'll never know why</i>
<i>Early Grayce became a killer.</i>

1062
01:50:57,500 --> 01:50:59,400
<i>I don't know why any of them do.</i>

1063
01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:02,900
<i>When I looked into his eyes,</i>

1064
01:51:03,100 --> 01:51:05,300
<i>I felt nothing.</i>

1065
01:51:05,500 --> 01:51:07,700
<i>Nothing.</i>

1066
01:51:07,900 --> 01:51:11,800
<i>That day I learned that any one of us</i>
<i>is capable of taking another human life.</i>

1067
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:17,700
<i>But I also learned that there is</i>
<i>a difference between us and them.</i>

1068
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,200
<i>It's in feeling remorse.</i>

1069
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:22,400
<i>Dealing with guilt.</i>

1070
01:51:23,200 --> 01:51:25,300
<i>And confronting your conscience.</i>

1071
01:51:26,500 --> 01:51:28,500
<i>Early never did.</i>

1072
01:51:43,100 --> 01:51:45,200
<i>June 22nd. The Novak farm.</i>

1073
01:51:45,500 --> 01:51:50,200
<i>Mr. Baxter slammed the door in my face</i>
<i>today, calling me a goddamn ghoul.</i>

1074
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:27,100
<i>I'm bettin' he's still alive.</i>

1075
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:31,100
<i>Real old, livin' in a trailer park</i>
<i>or somethin', somewheres.</i>

1076
01:52:31,400 --> 01:52:33,400
<i>But he's alive, see.</i>

1077
01:52:33,700 --> 01:52:36,000
<i>Now, he's thinkin' about what he done,</i>

1078
01:52:36,300 --> 01:52:40,400
<i>goin' over it and over it and over it</i>
<i>in his head, every night,</i>

1079
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:43,900
<i>thinkin' how smart he is</i>
<i>for gettin' away with it.</i>

1080
01:52:44,900 --> 01:52:46,800
<i>Thinkin'.</i>

1081
01:52:50,100 --> 01:52:52,500
Hey, how's it goin'?

1082
01:52:52,700 --> 01:52:55,400
Not bad. How was your swim?

1083
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:59,400
- It's freezing.
- It's November.

1084
01:53:01,700 --> 01:53:03,500
I know.

1085
01:53:07,600 --> 01:53:10,200
There's this gallery in Venice,

1086
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:13,600
and I showed them my work,
the icon series.

1087
01:53:13,900 --> 01:53:16,500
- I think they're interested.
- That's great.

1088
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:19,700
Well, it's not definite, but it's encouraging.

1089
01:53:22,300 --> 01:53:24,700
Well, let's celebrate. I'll take you to lunch.

1090
01:53:25,100 --> 01:53:27,200
OK.

1091
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:31,800
- So what happens next?
- Well, I have a meeting at the gallery,

1092
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:35,700
and they want to see
some more of my work. So...

1093
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:39,200
I'm sure they're gonna love it
as much as I do.

1094
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:42,900
<i>Hi!</i>

1095
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,400
<i>Guess who this is?</i>

1096
01:53:45,700 --> 01:53:48,300
<i>It's me, it's Adele.</i>

1097
01:53:48,700 --> 01:53:53,000
<i>I know I'm probably not supposed</i>
<i>to be talkin' on the tape recorder, but...</i>

1098
01:53:53,300 --> 01:53:55,600
<i>I just wanted to say thank you</i>

1099
01:53:55,900 --> 01:53:59,000
<i>for takin' me and Early</i>
<i>with you on your trip,</i>

1100
01:53:59,200 --> 01:54:03,200
<i>cos me and Early's</i>
<i>havin' a really good time.</i>

1101
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:09,900
<i>I just hope that</i>
<i>when we get to California,</i>

1102
01:54:10,200 --> 01:54:13,300
<i>that you guys don't forget all about us.</i>

1103
01:54:13,700 --> 01:54:16,800
<i>Cos friends are important and...</i>

1104
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:20,400
<i>Well, you're the only friends we got.</i>

1105
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:23,000
<i>Bye.</i>

1106
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:45,300
# <i>If I believed that destiny</i>

1107
01:54:46,900 --> 01:54:50,400
# <i>Changes to fate</i>

1108
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:56,300
# <i>I'd believe for ever</i>

1109
01:54:58,100 --> 01:55:02,600
# <i>Was a lonely place to play</i>

1110
01:55:04,900 --> 01:55:08,100
# <i>I can see inside your eyes</i>

1111
01:55:08,300 --> 01:55:10,600
# <i>A mirror soul cannot tell lies</i>

1112
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:16,200
# <i>I believe that I believe</i>

1113
01:55:17,300 --> 01:55:19,600
# <i>Miracles and destiny</i>

1114
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:22,700
# <i>You make your own reality</i>

1115
01:55:23,200 --> 01:55:25,400
# <i>I know</i>

1116
01:55:25,600 --> 01:55:29,900
# <i>When I</i>

1117
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:33,800
# <i>Look up to the sky</i>

1118
01:55:36,700 --> 01:55:41,800
# <i>There's angels in the clouds</i>

1119
01:55:43,100 --> 01:55:48,300
# <i>And that you can see their eyes</i>

1120
01:55:49,500 --> 01:55:56,700
# <i>See the stars lookin' down</i>

1121
01:56:07,300 --> 01:56:10,400
# <i>I feel like the thought of you</i>

1122
01:56:12,500 --> 01:56:15,200
# <i>Leaves me with</i>

1123
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:17,900
# <i>Nothin' to hide</i>

1124
01:56:19,600 --> 01:56:23,700
# <i>Cos when I'm there next to you</i>

1125
01:56:25,100 --> 01:56:30,800
# <i>Naked with my pride</i>

1126
01:56:31,200 --> 01:56:34,400
