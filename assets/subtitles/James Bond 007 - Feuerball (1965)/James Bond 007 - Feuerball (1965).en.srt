00:00:47,084 --> 00:00:48,585
<i>The coffin...</i>

3
00:00:48,752 --> 00:00:51,213
<i>it has your initials, J.B.</i>

4
00:00:51,295 --> 00:00:53,048
<i>At this moment,
rather him than me.</i>

5
00:00:55,049 --> 00:00:57,552
<i>At least you've been saved
the effort of removing him.</i>

6
00:00:57,594 --> 00:01:00,889
<i>Colonel Bouvar passed away
in his sleep, so they tell me.</i>

7
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,186
<i>You sound disappointed
you did not kill him yourself.</i>

8
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:10,899
<i>I am. Jacques Bouvar murdered
two of my colleagues.</i>

9
00:01:17,448 --> 00:01:21,367
<i>Is there anything else our
French station can do for Monsiuer Bond?</i>

10
00:01:22,453 --> 00:01:23,912
<i>Later, perhaps.</i>

11
00:01:34,423 --> 00:01:37,509
<i>As I said, later. Come on.</i>

12
00:02:19,217 --> 00:02:20,968
<i>Madame...</i>

13
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,473
<i>I've come to offer
my sincere condolences.</i>

14
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:28,060
<i>My dear Colonel Bouvar...</i>

15
00:02:28,143 --> 00:02:31,146
<i>I don't think you should have
opened that car door by yourself.</i>

16
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,086
<i>No well-dressed man
should be without one.</i>

17
00:04:18,127 --> 00:04:20,380
<i>Yes, very practical.</i>

18
00:04:20,463 --> 00:04:22,173
<i>Get inside.</i>

19
00:04:23,257 --> 00:04:25,843
<i>- They're coming to get me.
- Hurry!</i>

20
00:04:53,497 --> 00:04:57,334
<i>He always runs</i>

21
00:04:57,418 --> 00:05:00,002
<i>While others walk</i>

22
00:05:03,673 --> 00:05:06,093
<i>He acts</i>

23
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:10,471
<i>While other men just talk</i>

24
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,896
<i>He looks at this world</i>

25
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:21,108
<i>And wants it all</i>

26
00:05:23,901 --> 00:05:26,779
<i>So he strikes</i>

27
00:05:26,863 --> 00:05:31,994
<i>Like Thunderball</i>

28
00:05:34,872 --> 00:05:39,000
<i>He knows the meaning</i>

29
00:05:39,084 --> 00:05:42,336
<i>Of success</i>

30
00:05:44,757 --> 00:05:48,718
<i>His needs are more</i>

31
00:05:48,802 --> 00:05:52,473
<i>So he gives less</i>

32
00:05:54,932 --> 00:05:57,394
<i>They call him</i>

33
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:02,149
<i>The winner who takes all</i>

34
00:06:04,735 --> 00:06:07,028
<i>And he strikes</i>

35
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:11,449
<i>Like Thunderball</i>

36
00:06:15,286 --> 00:06:19,750
<i>Any woman he wants</i>

37
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:22,336
<i>He'll get</i>

38
00:06:24,713 --> 00:06:28,509
<i>He will break any heart</i>

39
00:06:28,591 --> 00:06:33,012
<i>Without regret</i>

40
00:06:35,057 --> 00:06:39,144
<i>His days of asking</i>

41
00:06:39,228 --> 00:06:42,314
<i>Are all gone</i>

42
00:06:44,649 --> 00:06:48,237
<i>His fight goes on</i>

43
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,781
<i>And on and on</i>

44
00:06:54,283 --> 00:06:58,247
<i>But he thinks that the fight</i>

45
00:06:58,329 --> 00:07:01,250
<i>Is worth it all</i>

46
00:07:03,961 --> 00:07:06,338
<i>So he strikes</i>

47
00:07:06,422 --> 00:07:11,468
<i>Like Thunderball</i>

48
00:07:52,867 --> 00:07:56,163
<i>Hey, no parking here!</i>

49
00:07:56,245 --> 00:07:58,165
<i>Pardon, Monsieur Largo.</i>

50
00:08:07,257 --> 00:08:10,134
<i>The International Brotherhood for
the Assistance of Stateless Persons...</i>

51
00:08:10,218 --> 00:08:11,845
<i>is purely philanthropic.</i>

52
00:08:11,928 --> 00:08:13,639
<i>We're not interested in politics...</i>

53
00:08:13,721 --> 00:08:15,641
<i>only in your rehabilitation.</i>

54
00:08:15,723 --> 00:08:19,644
<i>We have been able to arrange for
visas at the Brazilian Consulate.</i>

55
00:08:19,728 --> 00:08:21,980
<i>The Brotherhood
will look after you until...</i>

56
00:08:22,064 --> 00:08:24,399
<i>- Good morning, Mr. Largo.
- Good morning.</i>

57
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,026
<i>- Nice to have you back again.
- Thank you, my dear.</i>

58
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,403
<i>- We pay back everything!
- There will be no need.</i>

59
00:08:29,446 --> 00:08:32,740
<i>We have certain funds from
private individuals who share our aim.</i>

60
00:08:55,138 --> 00:08:57,682
<i>Sit down, Number Two.
We will discuss...</i>

61
00:08:57,765 --> 00:09:00,434
<i>your NATO project later.</i>

62
00:09:01,644 --> 00:09:05,982
<i>I regret to inform you all
of the death of Spectre Number Six.</i>

63
00:09:06,066 --> 00:09:09,443
<i>Colonel Jacques Bouvar was killed
by an unknown assassin.</i>

64
00:09:09,528 --> 00:09:12,614
<i>His services will be greatly missed.</i>

65
00:09:12,655 --> 00:09:16,784
<i>We will now proceed with the area
financial reports. Number Seven.</i>

66
00:09:18,202 --> 00:09:22,291
<i>Blackmail of the double agent
Matsou Fujiwa.</i>

67
00:09:22,374 --> 00:09:26,043
<i>Unfortunately, only 40 million yen.</i>

68
00:09:26,128 --> 00:09:28,212
<i>- All the man had.
- Number Ten.</i>

69
00:09:28,297 --> 00:09:31,883
<i>Assassination of Perringe,
the French antimatter specialist...</i>

70
00:09:31,966 --> 00:09:33,884
<i>who went over to the Russians.</i>

71
00:09:33,969 --> 00:09:36,304
<i>Three million francs
from the special department...</i>

72
00:09:36,346 --> 00:09:38,432
<i>- of the Quai D'Orsay.
- Number Five.</i>

73
00:09:38,514 --> 00:09:43,061
<i>Our consultation fee for the
British train robbery: 250,000 pounds.</i>

74
00:09:44,645 --> 00:09:46,480
<i>Number 11.</i>

75
00:09:46,523 --> 00:09:50,360
<i>Distribution of Red China narcotics
in the United States...</i>

76
00:09:50,443 --> 00:09:55,072
<i>2,300,000 dollars, collected by
Number Nine and myself.</i>

77
00:09:55,157 --> 00:09:56,991
<i>Two million three...</i>

78
00:09:57,033 --> 00:10:01,455
<i>Our expectations were considerably
higher, Number 11.</i>

79
00:10:01,538 --> 00:10:04,791
<i>Competition from Latin America.
Prices are down.</i>

80
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,793
<i>I anticipated that factor.</i>

81
00:10:07,878 --> 00:10:10,087
<i>Are you quite sure all monies...</i>

82
00:10:10,172 --> 00:10:13,549
<i>have been accounted for
by yourself and Number Nine?</i>

83
00:10:13,634 --> 00:10:17,095
<i>- To the penny, Number One.
- On the contrary...</i>

84
00:10:17,178 --> 00:10:19,972
<i>I have satisfied myself that
one of you is clearly...</i>

85
00:10:20,057 --> 00:10:22,183
<i>guilty of embezzlement.</i>

86
00:10:22,267 --> 00:10:24,226
<i>Spectre is a dedicated fraternity...</i>

87
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:28,273
<i>whose strength lies in
the absolute integrity of its members.</i>

88
00:10:28,356 --> 00:10:30,524
<i>The culprit is known to me.</i>

89
00:10:30,609 --> 00:10:33,278
<i>I have decided
on the appropriate action.</i>

90
00:10:54,341 --> 00:10:57,260
<i>Let us now proceed with new business.</i>

91
00:10:57,302 --> 00:11:01,306
<i>We will hear from Number Two,
who's in charge of our NATO project...</i>

92
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:04,058
<i>the most ambitious Spectre
has ever undertaken.</i>

93
00:11:04,142 --> 00:11:06,186
<i>Your report, Number Two.</i>

94
00:11:07,104 --> 00:11:08,605
<i>Thank you, Number One.</i>

95
00:11:08,688 --> 00:11:11,399
<i>Our intention
is to demand a ransom...</i>

96
00:11:11,482 --> 00:11:13,943
<i>from the
North Atlantic Treaty Powers...</i>

97
00:11:13,985 --> 00:11:16,738
<i>of 280 million dollars...</i>

98
00:11:16,822 --> 00:11:19,283
<i>100 million pounds.</i>

99
00:11:19,323 --> 00:11:23,452
<i>I have sent Spectre agent Count Lippe
to the south of England...</i>

100
00:11:23,537 --> 00:11:26,706
<i>where he is making
the necessary preparations.</i>

101
00:11:26,789 --> 00:11:28,417
<i>He is at a health clinic...</i>

102
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:33,254
<i>conveniently located
near the NATO air base.</i>

103
00:11:33,297 --> 00:11:35,423
<i>- Oh, Pat?
- Hello.</i>

104
00:11:35,465 --> 00:11:37,967
<i>- I'll see you when I've had a shower.
- I'll soon be finished.</i>

105
00:11:38,009 --> 00:11:41,053
<i>- Mr. Bond, Count Lippe.
- You're not taking her away already?</i>

106
00:11:41,138 --> 00:11:43,599
<i>She's the only joy
in this dreary place.</i>

107
00:11:44,807 --> 00:11:46,726
<i>I see you've discovered that too.</i>

108
00:11:48,186 --> 00:11:50,272
<i>- About half an hour, Pat.
- I'll be ready.</i>

109
00:11:50,313 --> 00:11:51,815
<i>I've heard that before.</i>

110
00:11:53,107 --> 00:11:56,068
<i>Nice to have met you, Mr. Bond.</i>

111
00:11:57,903 --> 00:12:00,573
<i>Funny looking bruise. A fall?</i>

112
00:12:00,657 --> 00:12:03,909
<i>A poker in the hands of a widow.</i>

113
00:12:03,994 --> 00:12:08,039
<i>I'm surprised. I'd have thought
you were just the type for a widow.</i>

114
00:12:08,123 --> 00:12:11,000
<i>Not this one.
He didn't like me at all.</i>

115
00:12:13,336 --> 00:12:15,422
<i>A red square
with a spike through it.</i>

116
00:12:15,504 --> 00:12:18,966
<i>I think it's a Tong sign,
the red dragon from Macao.</i>

117
00:12:19,051 --> 00:12:23,138
<i>- Ask records to verify it for me.
- Sorry, sweetie. You're off duty.</i>

118
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:25,222
<i>- File it till you get back.
- Moneypenny...</i>

119
00:12:25,307 --> 00:12:27,725
<i>next time I see you,
I'll put you across my knee.</i>

120
00:12:27,808 --> 00:12:32,648
<i>On yogurt and lemon juice?
I can hardly wait.</i>

121
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,274
<i>Come on, Pat.</i>

122
00:12:34,357 --> 00:12:35,984
<i>I'm coming.</i>

123
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,655
<i>I can't hear you. Have you fainted?</i>

124
00:14:12,998 --> 00:14:15,833
<i>You're late, Mr. Bond.</i>

125
00:14:17,418 --> 00:14:19,004
<i>Me?</i>

126
00:14:19,086 --> 00:14:21,505
<i>I'd never have recognized myself.</i>

127
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:26,427
<i>- Do I seem healthy?
- Too healthy. Take off your bathrobe.</i>

128
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,890
<i>You never say that
as if you meant it.</i>

129
00:14:30,974 --> 00:14:33,018
<i>Arms above your head, please.</i>

130
00:14:46,322 --> 00:14:49,283
<i>Behave yourself, Mr. Bond!</i>

131
00:14:49,326 --> 00:14:52,745
<i>I can see there's only
one place to keep you quiet.</i>

132
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,539
<i>What's this?</i>

133
00:14:55,624 --> 00:14:58,543
<i>A motorized traction table
for stretching the spine.</i>

134
00:14:58,626 --> 00:15:00,586
<i>Some patients call it the rack.</i>

135
00:15:00,671 --> 00:15:02,254
<i>I'm not surprised.</i>

136
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:03,923
<i>Get on.</i>

137
00:15:05,174 --> 00:15:07,134
<i>Where's the kick starter?</i>

138
00:15:07,177 --> 00:15:09,846
<i>Stop fooling around
and face down, please.</i>

139
00:15:09,929 --> 00:15:11,431
<i>Face down.</i>

140
00:15:11,514 --> 00:15:15,309
<i>By the way, who is the man
in the room next to your Count Lippe?</i>

141
00:15:15,394 --> 00:15:17,479
<i>I really don't know
too much about him.</i>

142
00:15:17,562 --> 00:15:19,273
<i>A Mr. Angelo.</i>

143
00:15:19,355 --> 00:15:23,860
<i>He's here with a private physician,
recuperating from an awful car crash.</i>

144
00:15:25,195 --> 00:15:28,990
<i>There, now, the first time
I've felt really safe all day.</i>

145
00:15:32,076 --> 00:15:34,578
<i>I'll look in and see
how you're doing in 15 minutes.</i>

146
00:15:55,057 --> 00:15:57,019
<i>Nice to have met you.</i>

147
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,859
<i>Hey, come back!</i>

148
00:16:10,948 --> 00:16:12,826
<i>Help!</i>

149
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,634
<i>Oh, thank God!</i>

150
00:16:28,716 --> 00:16:31,345
<i>You could've been killed!</i>

151
00:16:33,429 --> 00:16:35,389
<i>I must be six inches taller.</i>

152
00:16:36,432 --> 00:16:38,393
<i>You poor dear.</i>

153
00:16:38,434 --> 00:16:41,020
<i>I can't think how
it could have happened.</i>

154
00:16:41,104 --> 00:16:44,899
<i>I can tell you, it's a miracle
I came back when I did.</i>

155
00:16:44,942 --> 00:16:49,321
<i>I can only think that you must have
pushed the switch accidentally.</i>

156
00:16:49,403 --> 00:16:51,322
<i>You better come along with me.</i>

157
00:16:51,405 --> 00:16:55,159
<i>Spend a few minutes in the steam room.
It'll help to relax you.</i>

158
00:16:55,243 --> 00:16:57,913
<i>- Yes.
- Might even shrink you back to size.</i>

159
00:16:57,955 --> 00:17:01,082
<i>Somebody's going to wish
today had never happened.</i>

160
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,250
<i>You wouldn't tell Dr. Wain.</i>

161
00:17:03,335 --> 00:17:05,503
<i>Please, I'd lose my job.</i>

162
00:17:06,587 --> 00:17:10,217
<i>Well, I suppose my silence
could have a price.</i>

163
00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:13,761
<i>You don't mean... Oh, no.</i>

164
00:17:13,845 --> 00:17:15,763
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

165
00:17:25,315 --> 00:17:27,942
<i>See you later, irrigator.</i>

166
00:17:59,974 --> 00:18:03,144
<i>- What the hell are you doing?
- Don't you worry. I'll tell the chef.</i>

167
00:18:03,228 --> 00:18:06,147
<i>Let me out of this bloody machine!</i>

168
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,982
<i>Help!</i>

169
00:18:19,076 --> 00:18:20,828
<i>Mink.</i>

170
00:18:20,871 --> 00:18:23,832
<i>It reduces the tensions.</i>

171
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,627
<i>Not mine.</i>

172
00:18:41,057 --> 00:18:43,143
<i>Major Derval's social secretary.</i>

173
00:18:43,226 --> 00:18:45,686
<i>- I would like to speak to Mr. Angelo.
- What's that?</i>

174
00:18:45,729 --> 00:18:47,689
<i>- Mr. Angelo.
- I'm sorry.</i>

175
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,483
<i>You got the wrong number.</i>

176
00:18:50,567 --> 00:18:54,112
<i>You don't think you could be
more comfortable if you take off this...</i>

177
00:18:55,948 --> 00:18:57,865
<i>- Yes?
- Major Derval?</i>

178
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,867
<i>- This is Major Derval.
- Your car is waiting.</i>

179
00:18:59,951 --> 00:19:02,496
<i>I'll be down right away. Thank you.</i>

180
00:19:03,704 --> 00:19:06,458
<i>My car's here. Duty calls.
The story of my life.</i>

181
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,876
<i>You'll be late at the air base.</i>

182
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:11,380
<i>Besides, it will give you
time to cool off.</i>

183
00:19:11,462 --> 00:19:13,548
<i>You'll be here when I come back?</i>

184
00:19:15,592 --> 00:19:18,053
<i>But I may not be in the mood then.</i>

185
00:19:19,262 --> 00:19:21,640
<i>- Do you wanna bet?
- You know your Francois.</i>

186
00:19:21,722 --> 00:19:23,392
<i>I know me.</i>

187
00:19:24,268 --> 00:19:25,559
<i>All right.</i>

188
00:19:25,644 --> 00:19:28,771
<i>- I told him I'd be down.
- Your coat, sir.</i>

189
00:19:30,856 --> 00:19:32,608
<i>Happy landing!</i>

190
00:19:32,692 --> 00:19:34,611
<i>Thank you.</i>

191
00:19:34,694 --> 00:19:37,364
<i>Be good, at least until I get back.</i>

192
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,381
<i>- Nobody saw us. The corridor's empty.
- Shut the door!</i>

193
00:19:59,469 --> 00:20:01,930
<i>He's dead all right.
Lippe, you take over.</i>

194
00:20:01,971 --> 00:20:04,849
<i>- Are the doctor and ambulance outside?
- Everything as arranged.</i>

195
00:20:04,932 --> 00:20:07,435
<i>Angelo.</i>

196
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:09,605
<i>Your breathing equipment.</i>

197
00:20:09,688 --> 00:20:12,398
<i>Isolates you from the oxygen supply.</i>

198
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:17,778
<i>Gamma gas. Instantaneous.
Type you just used. And most important...</i>

199
00:20:23,701 --> 00:20:27,955
<i>Not enough.
100,000 dollars is not enough.</i>

200
00:20:27,998 --> 00:20:30,541
<i>- What are you trying to say?
- I changed my mind.</i>

201
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,419
<i>Two years of my life...</i>

202
00:20:32,501 --> 00:20:34,962
<i>studying the film, the reports...</i>

203
00:20:35,005 --> 00:20:38,884
<i>plastic operations, voice lessons.</i>

204
00:20:38,967 --> 00:20:43,096
<i>Make it a quarter of a million,
or get someone else.</i>

205
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:46,807
<i>- There is no one else.
- Exactly. I am Derval.</i>

206
00:20:54,148 --> 00:20:56,984
<i>Put that away. Angelo is right.</i>

207
00:20:57,068 --> 00:20:59,904
<i>I'll inform Number One
we made a new arrangement.</i>

208
00:20:59,988 --> 00:21:02,865
<i>This is merely a down payment.</i>

209
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,618
<i>All right, but against
a quarter of a million.</i>

210
00:21:05,701 --> 00:21:07,828
<i>- Agreed.
- His watch.</i>

211
00:21:07,871 --> 00:21:10,082
<i>Identification Disc.</i>

212
00:21:14,044 --> 00:21:16,505
<i>- Au revoir!
- No, he always says ciao.</i>

213
00:21:18,882 --> 00:21:21,509
<i>The cap's too far back on your head.</i>

214
00:21:24,721 --> 00:21:27,015
<i>The rest of my money,
just have it ready.</i>

215
00:21:30,269 --> 00:21:33,480
<i>Come on. Get him into his pajamas.</i>

216
00:21:47,576 --> 00:21:49,538
<i>Sir, identity, please.</i>

217
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,380
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

218
00:21:59,714 --> 00:22:02,718
<i>This is a normal training sortie,
and you'll be accompanied...</i>

219
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:06,054
<i>by a NATO representative,
Commandant Derval...</i>

220
00:22:06,137 --> 00:22:08,432
<i>Major Derval of NATO.</i>

221
00:22:08,515 --> 00:22:11,226
<i>It's a routine flight.
You'll be flying a Vulcan...</i>

222
00:22:11,268 --> 00:22:13,228
<i>at an altitude of 45,000 feet...</i>

223
00:22:13,269 --> 00:22:17,023
<i>armed with two atomic bombs,
M.O.S. Type.</i>

224
00:22:17,065 --> 00:22:19,692
<i>Fuses as usual
in the white security box.</i>

225
00:22:48,012 --> 00:22:50,973
<i>Oh, those damned aeroplanes!</i>

226
00:22:51,057 --> 00:22:54,435
<i>They're enough to drive you mad.</i>

227
00:22:56,270 --> 00:23:00,067
<i>Unless, of course,
it's that mink glove of yours.</i>

228
00:23:01,609 --> 00:23:04,488
<i>I'll shut out the noise.</i>

229
00:23:26,718 --> 00:23:29,429
<i>James, where are you going?</i>

230
00:23:30,471 --> 00:23:34,934
<i>Nowhere. I thought
I'd take a little exercise.</i>

231
00:23:35,018 --> 00:23:37,144
<i>You must be joking.</i>

232
00:23:38,771 --> 00:23:40,440
<i>Come on.</i>

233
00:23:43,986 --> 00:23:45,444
<i>Quiet!</i>

234
00:25:48,943 --> 00:25:50,945
<i>Can I help you?
County Police here.</i>

235
00:25:51,028 --> 00:25:52,614
<i>Hello?</i>

236
00:25:58,953 --> 00:26:01,414
<i>- What's going on?
- I don't know.</i>

237
00:26:01,455 --> 00:26:03,625
<i>Could it be the front doorbell?</i>

238
00:26:03,709 --> 00:26:06,502
<i>- It most certainly could not.
- Hello.</i>

239
00:26:06,586 --> 00:26:10,548
<i>Haven't you had enough exercise
for one evening?</i>

240
00:26:10,632 --> 00:26:13,093
<i>It's funny you should say that.</i>

241
00:26:16,887 --> 00:26:18,640
<i>Point of return...</i>

242
00:26:18,723 --> 00:26:21,602
<i>45 minutes, 30 seconds.</i>

243
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:26,147
<i>Switch from manual to auto.</i>

244
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:28,608
<i>It's set on automatic. Commandant...</i>

245
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:31,153
<i>would you care to change places
with the copilot?</i>

246
00:26:31,193 --> 00:26:33,279
<i>- Better view up here.
- I'd be delighted.</i>

247
00:27:07,605 --> 00:27:09,816
<i>This is Southern Radar.</i>

248
00:27:09,857 --> 00:27:13,569
<i>You are now under
positive radar control.</i>

249
00:27:13,653 --> 00:27:15,571
<i>This is avoiding action.</i>

250
00:28:13,297 --> 00:28:15,548
<i>Request you report your position.</i>

251
00:28:51,292 --> 00:28:54,211
<i>Take this, will you?
What's the flap, Dawson?</i>

252
00:28:54,296 --> 00:28:57,214
<i>O-B-N-R, sir. NATO training flight.
Air traffic flashed us.</i>

253
00:28:57,298 --> 00:28:59,968
<i>They lost it on radar. We haven't
been able to pick it up anywhere.</i>

254
00:29:00,051 --> 00:29:02,554
<i>Was she losing altitude
when she went off the screen?</i>

255
00:29:02,637 --> 00:29:05,140
<i>Rapidly.
We can't scan below 300 feet.</i>

256
00:29:05,222 --> 00:29:07,142
<i>- She may have gone down.
- Was she in trouble?</i>

257
00:29:07,224 --> 00:29:10,228
<i>Not according to the last report,
which came from about here.</i>

258
00:29:10,311 --> 00:29:13,565
<i>- She is armed, isn't she?
- Two atomic weapons, M.O.S. Type.</i>

259
00:29:13,648 --> 00:29:16,026
<i>Get everything you can into the area.
A thorough search.</i>

260
00:29:16,108 --> 00:29:19,488
<i>Notify the Admiralty at once.
Top priority. Absolute security.</i>

261
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:21,615
<i>- Ask them to contact Washington.
- Very good, sir.</i>

262
00:29:48,892 --> 00:29:51,353
<i>Is there anything else in sight?</i>

263
00:29:51,435 --> 00:29:53,188
<i>No. All clear.</i>

264
00:29:53,271 --> 00:29:56,232
<i>Switch on
the underwater landing lights.</i>

265
00:31:14,644 --> 00:31:16,605
<i>Open the underwater hatch.</i>

266
00:35:39,076 --> 00:35:42,036
<i>- Stand by to winch in the submarine.
- Man the winches!</i>

267
00:35:48,043 --> 00:35:50,878
<i>- Give these bomb fuses to Mr. Kutze.
- Right, sir.</i>

268
00:35:53,798 --> 00:35:57,219
<i>Get the submarine up quickly and
the bombs loaded in the containers.</i>

269
00:35:57,302 --> 00:36:00,472
<i>Kutze, are you pleased
with your new toys?</i>

270
00:36:00,554 --> 00:36:03,391
<i>Some new safety device.
A secret control.</i>

271
00:36:03,474 --> 00:36:06,728
<i>What can they have that the great
Ladislav Kutze cannot handle?</i>

272
00:36:06,811 --> 00:36:10,023
<i>Life was much simpler
in my Warsaw laboratory.</i>

273
00:36:10,065 --> 00:36:13,485
<i>Your share will amount to
how many Nobel Prizes?</i>

274
00:36:13,568 --> 00:36:15,487
<i>Pull forward!</i>

275
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:19,574
<i>More. Hold it!</i>

276
00:36:42,806 --> 00:36:45,559
<i>Paris, sir.
Number One on the scrambler.</i>

277
00:36:48,269 --> 00:36:51,356
<i>Number Two speaking.
Phase two completed.</i>

278
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,943
<i>Number Two has done well,
unlike Count Lippe...</i>

279
00:36:56,027 --> 00:37:00,657
<i>whose choice of Angelo might have
jeopardized the success of our project.</i>

280
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:03,242
<i>Send a message to the Execution Branch.</i>

281
00:37:03,327 --> 00:37:06,079
<i>You will write,
or telephone at the least.</i>

282
00:37:06,121 --> 00:37:09,666
<i>Day by day. I'm truly sorry
I have to dash off like this.</i>

283
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,668
<i>There's been a bit
of a flap at the office.</i>

284
00:37:11,751 --> 00:37:14,211
<i>- What kind of work do you do?
- I travel...</i>

285
00:37:14,295 --> 00:37:17,257
<i>sort of a licensed troubleshooter.</i>

286
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,469
<i>Mr. Angelo. Heart attack last night.</i>

287
00:37:21,552 --> 00:37:23,387
<i>I'm not surprised.</i>

288
00:37:24,806 --> 00:37:28,226
<i>- Keep in touch.
- Anytime, James. Anyplace.</i>

289
00:37:28,309 --> 00:37:31,396
<i>Another time, another place.</i>

290
00:38:53,228 --> 00:38:55,355
<i>- You are late!
- Yes.</i>

291
00:38:55,396 --> 00:38:57,815
<i>Some people on the road
really burn you up these days.</i>

292
00:38:57,898 --> 00:39:00,360
<i>In the conference room.
Something pretty big.</i>

293
00:39:00,443 --> 00:39:04,739
<i>Every Double-0 man in Europe has been
rushed in, and the Home Secretary too.</i>

294
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:07,199
<i>His wife's probably lost her dog.</i>

295
00:39:22,257 --> 00:39:24,467
<i>Well, now that we're all here...</i>

296
00:39:29,431 --> 00:39:32,809
<i>The Prime Minister
has asked the Home Secretary...</i>

297
00:39:32,893 --> 00:39:35,019
<i>to come and represent him here today.</i>

298
00:39:35,103 --> 00:39:36,438
<i>The Home Secretary.</i>

299
00:39:37,773 --> 00:39:41,233
<i>Gentlemen, the tape
that you are about to hear...</i>

300
00:39:41,318 --> 00:39:43,903
<i>was received at 10 Downing Street
this morning.</i>

301
00:39:44,905 --> 00:39:47,282
<i>My dear Prime Minister.</i>

302
00:39:47,324 --> 00:39:49,284
<i>Two atomic bombs...</i>

303
00:39:49,326 --> 00:39:51,911
<i>numbers 4-5-6 and 4-5-7...</i>

304
00:39:51,954 --> 00:39:55,164
<i>which were aboard NATO flight 7-5-9...</i>

305
00:39:55,248 --> 00:39:57,626
<i>are now in the possession of Spectre.</i>

306
00:39:57,668 --> 00:40:01,003
<i>Unless within the next seven days
your government...</i>

307
00:40:01,088 --> 00:40:05,259
<i>pays to us
100 million pounds sterling...</i>

308
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:08,427
<i>in a manner to be designated by us...</i>

309
00:40:08,512 --> 00:40:10,597
<i>we shall destroy
a major city in England...</i>

310
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:14,101
<i>or the United States of America.</i>

311
00:40:14,184 --> 00:40:16,978
<i>Please signal your acceptance
of our terms by arranging...</i>

312
00:40:17,019 --> 00:40:20,606
<i>for Big Ben to strike seven times...</i>

313
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:24,777
<i>at 6:00 p. m. Tomorrow.</i>

314
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:27,322
<i>The Prime Minister and the President...</i>

315
00:40:27,405 --> 00:40:32,119
<i>have talked together
over the hot line and have agreed...</i>

316
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:36,789
<i>that unless the bombs are recovered,
payment will have to be made.</i>

317
00:40:36,873 --> 00:40:38,625
<i>To avoid general panic...</i>

318
00:40:38,708 --> 00:40:42,170
<i>complete secrecy will be maintained
and no press announcements.</i>

319
00:40:42,253 --> 00:40:45,673
<i>The Prime Minister has asked
that your department...</i>

320
00:40:45,715 --> 00:40:47,675
<i>take charge of the operation.</i>

321
00:40:47,717 --> 00:40:49,802
<i>Thank you. Sir John.</i>

322
00:41:06,193 --> 00:41:09,822
<i>This circle represents
the full flying range of the Vulcan.</i>

323
00:41:09,905 --> 00:41:12,992
<i>Extensive search has failed to locate
any evidence of either a crash...</i>

324
00:41:13,034 --> 00:41:16,038
<i>or landing, and worldwide reports
have proved negative...</i>

325
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,041
<i>on all airfields large enough
to handle the Vulcan.</i>

326
00:41:19,081 --> 00:41:21,876
<i>- That's all we have, sir.
- Thank you, Sir John.</i>

327
00:41:21,918 --> 00:41:26,465
<i>I'll leave you to carry on.
We'll keep you in touch from Number 10.</i>

328
00:41:26,547 --> 00:41:28,467
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

329
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,137
<i>You may now open the folders
in front of you.</i>

330
00:41:41,563 --> 00:41:44,148
<i>Code name: Thunderball.</i>

331
00:41:47,068 --> 00:41:49,028
<i>As you can see,
we've very little to go on.</i>

332
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:51,572
<i>All the members of the crew...</i>

333
00:41:51,657 --> 00:41:53,951
<i>had top security clearance.</i>

334
00:41:54,034 --> 00:41:57,204
<i>You'll find their photographs
and service records in your files.</i>

335
00:41:57,286 --> 00:42:00,581
<i>You'll be working with NATO, C.I. A...</i>

336
00:42:00,666 --> 00:42:02,583
<i>and all allied intelligence units.</i>

337
00:42:02,626 --> 00:42:04,001
<i>That's all...</i>

338
00:42:04,085 --> 00:42:06,380
<i>until you discuss your
individual assignments with me.</i>

339
00:42:09,215 --> 00:42:12,010
<i>I've assigned you
to station C, Canada.</i>

340
00:42:12,094 --> 00:42:14,846
<i>Group Captain Pritchard here
will be your Air Force liaison.</i>

341
00:42:14,929 --> 00:42:18,182
<i>Sir, I respectfully suggest that
you change my assignment to Nassau.</i>

342
00:42:18,307 --> 00:42:21,936
<i>Is there any other reason besides
your enthusiasm of water sports?</i>

343
00:42:23,105 --> 00:42:24,606
<i>Perhaps this, sir.</i>

344
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:30,362
<i>- Well?
- There was a photograph of that man...</i>

345
00:42:30,445 --> 00:42:32,364
<i>in this dossier you gave us.</i>

346
00:42:32,447 --> 00:42:34,365
<i>His name is Derval.</i>

347
00:42:34,449 --> 00:42:37,536
<i>I saw him last night at Shrublands,
but he was dead.</i>

348
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:39,954
<i>Oh, no, sir. Not possible.
He was seen...</i>

349
00:42:39,996 --> 00:42:41,956
<i>boarding the Vulcan
and took off last night.</i>

350
00:42:42,039 --> 00:42:46,420
<i>If 007 says he saw Derval
last night and he was dead...</i>

351
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:49,130
<i>that's enough for me
to initiate inquiries.</i>

352
00:42:49,213 --> 00:42:50,882
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

353
00:42:50,965 --> 00:42:54,219
<i>- Who is this girl?
- Derval's sister.</i>

354
00:42:56,221 --> 00:42:58,139
<i>- Do you know where she is now?
- Nassau.</i>

355
00:42:59,474 --> 00:43:01,601
<i>Do you think she's worth going after?</i>

356
00:43:01,643 --> 00:43:03,811
<i>I wouldn't put it quite that way.</i>

357
00:43:03,894 --> 00:43:06,440
<i>We've only got four days.</i>

358
00:43:06,481 --> 00:43:09,067
<i>Don't spend your time sitting around.</i>

359
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:11,445
<i>No, sir, I won't.</i>

360
00:43:12,987 --> 00:43:15,114
<i>Good luck.</i>

361
00:43:15,197 --> 00:43:17,242
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

362
00:43:17,326 --> 00:43:19,452
<i>Smashing figure.
I don't suppose...</i>

363
00:43:19,494 --> 00:43:22,164
<i>that has anything to do
with your request?</i>

364
00:43:22,246 --> 00:43:24,416
<i>Was there ever a man
more misunderstood?</i>

365
00:43:24,498 --> 00:43:26,626
<i>You can't pull the wool over my eyes.</i>

366
00:43:26,668 --> 00:43:30,463
<i>You may be able to con the old man,
but I know better. I could...</i>

367
00:43:31,757 --> 00:43:33,925
<i>So do I, Miss Moneypenny.</i>

368
00:43:34,009 --> 00:43:38,096
<i>And I'll thank you not to refer to me
as the old man.</i>

369
00:43:39,431 --> 00:43:41,974
<i>I think I had a hat when I came in.</i>

370
00:43:49,273 --> 00:43:51,902
<i>How else will you recognize her?</i>

371
00:43:51,985 --> 00:43:55,614
<i>Couldn't miss.
She has two moles on the left thigh.</i>

372
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:02,597
<i>- Thank you, Mr...
- James Bond.</i>

373
00:45:02,681 --> 00:45:04,724
<i>I arrived soon after you went down.</i>

374
00:45:04,766 --> 00:45:06,893
<i>- I've been admiring your form.
- Have you?</i>

375
00:45:06,934 --> 00:45:10,396
<i>Your name's James Bond
and you've been admiring my form.</i>

376
00:45:10,438 --> 00:45:12,773
<i>Most girls just paddle around.</i>

377
00:45:12,815 --> 00:45:15,527
<i>- You swim like a man.
- So do you.</i>

378
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:18,030
<i>I've had quite a bit of practice.</i>

379
00:45:18,112 --> 00:45:20,740
<i>- Do you come here often?
- Whenever I'm bored.</i>

380
00:45:20,782 --> 00:45:22,617
<i>Practically every day.</i>

381
00:45:22,659 --> 00:45:24,744
<i>What else do you do, and where?</i>

382
00:45:24,786 --> 00:45:27,204
<i>- You don't waste time, do you?
- No.</i>

383
00:45:27,289 --> 00:45:29,206
<i>- For effort.
- Thank you.</i>

384
00:45:29,291 --> 00:45:31,543
<i>I'll wear it so you know me next time.</i>

385
00:45:32,878 --> 00:45:34,795
<i>I was right. Couldn't miss.</i>

386
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,423
<i>- I'm not with you.
- You soon will be.</i>

387
00:45:40,802 --> 00:45:41,929
<i>Paula!</i>

388
00:45:41,969 --> 00:45:44,556
<i>- Give me a hand, will you?
- Get in.</i>

389
00:45:48,101 --> 00:45:50,436
<i>Tell London I've made contact
with the girl.</i>

390
00:45:50,478 --> 00:45:52,898
<i>Well, it's not what I'd call contact.</i>

391
00:45:52,981 --> 00:45:55,442
<i>I'll pass it through
you've seen the girl.</i>

392
00:45:56,943 --> 00:46:00,155
<i>- Keep trying.
- It won't start!</i>

393
00:46:07,829 --> 00:46:10,164
<i>Ahoy there! Our motor's conked out.</i>

394
00:46:10,248 --> 00:46:12,208
<i>You wouldn't be going anywhere
near Coral Harbor, would you?</i>

395
00:46:12,291 --> 00:46:14,001
<i>I wasn't, but I could.</i>

396
00:46:14,085 --> 00:46:17,297
<i>I have a very important appointment.
I'd appreciate a lift.</i>

397
00:46:17,338 --> 00:46:19,132
<i>Come aboard then!</i>

398
00:46:19,173 --> 00:46:21,175
<i>You don't mind taking
the service boat, do you?</i>

399
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:22,677
<i>Not at all.</i>

400
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:25,304
<i>Hurry up!</i>

401
00:47:04,885 --> 00:47:08,514
<i>- Perhaps lunch by the pool.
- How about your urgent appointment?</i>

402
00:47:25,865 --> 00:47:27,784
<i>How long have you been out here?</i>

403
00:47:27,867 --> 00:47:29,786
<i>About three weeks.</i>

404
00:47:29,869 --> 00:47:32,079
<i>Don't you ever stop asking questions?</i>

405
00:47:32,164 --> 00:47:35,666
<i>All right. Change of tack.
Have some of my conch chowder.</i>

406
00:47:36,585 --> 00:47:38,836
<i>You've been reading
the wrong books, Mr. Bond.</i>

407
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,880
<i>- About conch chowder?
- Being an aphrodisiac.</i>

408
00:47:41,965 --> 00:47:44,217
<i>It just so happens that
I like conch chowder.</i>

409
00:47:49,639 --> 00:47:51,391
<i>Friend of yours?</i>

410
00:47:51,432 --> 00:47:54,894
<i>- Works for my guardian.
- Your guardian has you watched?</i>

411
00:47:54,978 --> 00:47:58,440
<i>- He likes to know where I am.
- I don't blame him.</i>

412
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:09,284
<i>- Will you excuse me?
- You're not going so soon?</i>

413
00:48:09,367 --> 00:48:11,077
<i>I'm afraid so.</i>

414
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:13,704
<i>My guardian's yacht.</i>

415
00:48:13,789 --> 00:48:15,123
<i>Oh, really?</i>

416
00:48:15,164 --> 00:48:17,626
<i>- He'll be expecting me.
- May I come with you?</i>

417
00:48:17,668 --> 00:48:20,461
<i>- I'd love to meet your guardian.
- Oh, no.</i>

418
00:48:20,545 --> 00:48:23,340
<i>- Will I see you again?
- It's a small island.</i>

419
00:48:23,422 --> 00:48:25,925
<i>- Perhaps we can have dinner together.
- No.</i>

420
00:48:26,009 --> 00:48:29,512
<i>- My dear, uncooperative Domino.
- How do you know that?</i>

421
00:48:29,596 --> 00:48:32,641
<i>How do you know
my friends call me Domino?</i>

422
00:48:32,724 --> 00:48:34,934
<i>It's on the bracelet on your ankle.</i>

423
00:48:34,976 --> 00:48:38,105
<i>What sharp little eyes you've got.</i>

424
00:48:39,648 --> 00:48:41,565
<i>Wait till you get to my teeth.</i>

425
00:48:50,534 --> 00:48:53,494
<i>Bye then.
See you tomorrow on the beach.</i>

426
00:49:27,028 --> 00:49:29,447
<i>- 500 pounds, please.
- Certainly, monsieur.</i>

427
00:49:29,572 --> 00:49:31,032
<i>Thanks.</i>

428
00:49:34,036 --> 00:49:36,121
<i>Sorry.</i>

429
00:49:36,204 --> 00:49:38,123
<i>- There.
- Thank you.</i>

430
00:49:48,675 --> 00:49:50,260
<i>Two hundred.</i>

431
00:50:09,153 --> 00:50:10,237
<i>Eight.</i>

432
00:50:12,324 --> 00:50:14,534
<i>Someone has to lose.</i>

433
00:50:14,617 --> 00:50:16,661
<i>Yes, I thought I saw
a spectre at your shoulder.</i>

434
00:50:18,288 --> 00:50:20,248
<i>What do you mean?</i>

435
00:50:20,289 --> 00:50:23,501
<i>The spectre of defeat.
Your luck was due to change.</i>

436
00:50:23,585 --> 00:50:25,545
<i>We'll soon find out.</i>

437
00:50:25,586 --> 00:50:28,215
<i>Any objection to raise the limit?
500 pounds shall we say?</i>

438
00:50:28,297 --> 00:50:30,592
<i>- Too big for me.
- Count me out too.</i>

439
00:50:30,675 --> 00:50:32,594
<i>Perhaps you would like
to take the shoe.</i>

440
00:50:32,677 --> 00:50:34,846
<i>My friend won't mind, Mr...</i>

441
00:50:34,929 --> 00:50:37,516
<i>- Bond.
- Oh, yes. Mr. Bond.</i>

442
00:50:38,432 --> 00:50:42,521
<i>- One of my associates spoke about you.
- Nothing bad, I hope.</i>

443
00:50:45,523 --> 00:50:48,735
<i>It's your spectre against mine.</i>

444
00:50:48,777 --> 00:50:50,862
<i>You wish to put the evil eye on me?</i>

445
00:50:50,945 --> 00:50:54,074
<i>We have a way to deal with that
where I come from.</i>

446
00:50:54,157 --> 00:50:56,117
<i>You may hex me.
Let's see what it does for the cards.</i>

447
00:50:58,286 --> 00:51:01,123
<i>- No.
- Seven.</i>

448
00:51:01,164 --> 00:51:02,456
<i>Six.</i>

449
00:51:21,018 --> 00:51:22,893
<i>Eight.</i>

450
00:51:22,978 --> 00:51:24,563
<i>Nine.</i>

451
00:51:26,315 --> 00:51:28,942
<i>You seem to be unbeatable, Mr. Bond.</i>

452
00:51:28,983 --> 00:51:31,485
<i>For the moment.
This sort of thing can't last.</i>

453
00:51:31,527 --> 00:51:33,487
<i>Emilio, you promised
to buy me a drink.</i>

454
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:35,574
<i>Soon, my dear.
I want to get my money back first.</i>

455
00:51:35,657 --> 00:51:38,117
<i>May I be allowed
to buy the lady a drink?</i>

456
00:51:39,577 --> 00:51:42,998
<i>- I would appreciate that.
- Then I must pass the shoe.</i>

457
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:50,172
<i>He's going to be impossible
if his luck doesn't change.</i>

458
00:51:50,255 --> 00:51:52,340
<i>Somehow, I don't think it will tonight.</i>

459
00:51:54,635 --> 00:51:57,137
<i>Beluga caviar, Dom Perignon, '55.</i>

460
00:51:57,179 --> 00:51:59,806
<i>- Monsieur.
- Thank you.</i>

461
00:51:59,847 --> 00:52:01,807
<i>I understand you're Mr. Largo's niece.</i>

462
00:52:03,268 --> 00:52:07,688
<i>Sounds better than... What would you say?
Mistress? Kept woman?</i>

463
00:52:07,731 --> 00:52:10,442
<i>I wouldn't say that.
Where did you meet him?</i>

464
00:52:10,525 --> 00:52:13,778
<i>In Capri. I was there
with my brother, Francois.</i>

465
00:52:15,697 --> 00:52:18,909
<i>Strange. I found Emilio attractive...</i>

466
00:52:18,992 --> 00:52:20,117
<i>then.</i>

467
00:52:21,244 --> 00:52:24,456
<i>- Does he live aboard the yacht?
- No. He has a house on the island.</i>

468
00:52:24,539 --> 00:52:27,833
<i>Must we talk about him?
I'd much rather dance.</i>

469
00:52:27,876 --> 00:52:29,835
<i>So would I.</i>

470
00:52:36,677 --> 00:52:39,179
<i>- Where is your brother now?
- In England.</i>

471
00:52:39,262 --> 00:52:42,014
<i>He's a Commandant
with the NATO forces there.</i>

472
00:52:42,056 --> 00:52:44,559
<i>He's a wonderful person.</i>

473
00:52:44,601 --> 00:52:47,436
<i>The trouble is
I never meet anyone like him.</i>

474
00:52:47,521 --> 00:52:51,233
<i>- Only men like Largo and myself.
- You are not like Largo.</i>

475
00:52:51,315 --> 00:52:52,900
<i>No?</i>

476
00:52:53,943 --> 00:52:55,903
<i>Why do you say that?</i>

477
00:52:58,447 --> 00:53:01,159
<i>The way you hold me.</i>

478
00:53:05,204 --> 00:53:06,581
<i>There.</i>

479
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:15,882
<i>- How long are you staying in Nassau?
- We're going the day after tomorrow.</i>

480
00:53:17,759 --> 00:53:20,887
<i>As I said,
we haven't got much time.</i>

481
00:53:20,929 --> 00:53:23,056
<i>Emilio wants to leave.</i>

482
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:29,146
<i>Are you sleeping aboard tonight?</i>

483
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,108
<i>I hoped you'd not be so obvious.</i>

484
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:35,902
<i>Well, when one has so little time,
one sort of has to be obvious.</i>

485
00:53:35,943 --> 00:53:38,780
<i>- You know where you can find me.
- Mr. Bond.</i>

486
00:53:38,864 --> 00:53:41,115
<i>Your niece is an excellent dancer.</i>

487
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:44,619
<i>Let me prove I'm as good a loser
as you are a winner.</i>

488
00:53:44,702 --> 00:53:47,914
<i>Come to lunch on Sunday.
The Palmyra. It's my house.</i>

489
00:53:47,998 --> 00:53:49,958
<i>Sunday at noon, then.</i>

490
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,460
<i>My dear.</i>

491
00:53:51,543 --> 00:53:53,503
<i>- Good night.
- Good night.</i>

492
00:53:53,586 --> 00:53:56,882
<i>You must tell me what Mr. Bond
had to say, word for word.</i>

493
00:53:56,965 --> 00:53:58,884
<i>He talked about you a little.</i>

494
00:53:58,967 --> 00:54:01,010
<i>What was he saying just then?
I didn't quite hear.</i>

495
00:54:01,094 --> 00:54:03,137
<i>He asked were we
sleeping aboard tonight.</i>

496
00:54:03,221 --> 00:54:04,806
<i>Interesting.</i>

497
00:54:21,239 --> 00:54:24,952
<i>- My key. It's 304, please.
- Thank you. 304.</i>

498
00:54:26,702 --> 00:54:29,623
<i>- I'm sorry, no mail.
- Thank you.</i>

499
00:56:33,371 --> 00:56:34,998
<i>Well, hello, 00...</i>

500
00:57:02,108 --> 00:57:04,235
<i>That's a fine way
to treat the C.I.A.</i>

501
00:57:04,318 --> 00:57:07,655
<i>Sorry about that, Felix,
but you were about to say 007.</i>

502
00:57:07,739 --> 00:57:09,324
<i>Here.</i>

503
00:57:11,201 --> 00:57:13,161
<i>Have you killed him?</i>

504
00:57:13,202 --> 00:57:15,664
<i>You know me better than that.
Here you go, Smiler.</i>

505
00:57:18,166 --> 00:57:20,626
<i>Have you seen everything
you came to see?</i>

506
00:57:20,668 --> 00:57:22,628
<i>Go back to your friends and report.</i>

507
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:27,009
<i>Tell them, the little fish I throw back
into the sea. Give it to him.</i>

508
00:57:27,092 --> 00:57:29,635
<i>You're going to shoot me in the back.</i>

509
00:57:29,719 --> 00:57:31,804
<i>The gun, I mean.</i>

510
00:57:35,182 --> 00:57:37,018
<i>Get out!</i>

511
00:57:37,101 --> 00:57:40,146
<i>- Who was he?
- Like I said, a small fish...</i>

512
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:42,190
<i>working for a Mr. Largo.</i>

513
00:57:42,273 --> 00:57:44,818
<i>He's got a yacht
we should take a look at later.</i>

514
00:57:49,697 --> 00:57:52,826
<i>- Quist to see Mr. Largo.
- Open up.</i>

515
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:08,342
<i>Yes? It's Quist.</i>

516
00:58:11,052 --> 00:58:13,179
<i>Gently, my friend.</i>

517
00:58:14,306 --> 00:58:16,432
<i>- What did you find?
- Nothing.</i>

518
00:58:16,516 --> 00:58:19,186
<i>- You saw Bond?
- Yes, I saw him.</i>

519
00:58:19,268 --> 00:58:21,228
<i>What happened?</i>

520
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:27,068
<i>You let him get the better of you.</i>

521
00:58:55,097 --> 00:58:57,682
<i>Hey, there,
did you finally make contact?</i>

522
00:58:57,766 --> 00:59:00,811
<i>You're late. Felix Leiter,
this is Pinder, our man here.</i>

523
00:59:00,893 --> 00:59:03,813
<i>- How do you do?
- This way, gentlemen.</i>

524
00:59:03,896 --> 00:59:06,733
<i>- Who's the girl?
- Paula Kaplan, my assistant here.</i>

525
00:59:12,614 --> 00:59:15,534
<i>He has no plans
to visit the United States.</i>

526
00:59:15,617 --> 00:59:17,536
<i>Now here's a special announcement...</i>

527
00:59:17,619 --> 00:59:19,704
<i>from the Overseas Service
of the B.B.C.</i>

528
00:59:19,788 --> 00:59:24,458
<i>Big Ben actually did strike
seven times at 6:00 this evening.</i>

529
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:26,460
<i>This was caused
by a mechanical failure...</i>

530
00:59:26,545 --> 00:59:30,590
<i>which last occurred during
a violent electrical storm in 1898.</i>

531
00:59:30,673 --> 00:59:33,092
<i>And here once again
are the headlines.</i>

532
00:59:33,135 --> 00:59:35,137
<i>Obviously stalling for time.</i>

533
00:59:38,806 --> 00:59:40,934
<i>- Oh, no!
- Ah, 007.</i>

534
00:59:41,018 --> 00:59:43,686
<i>- What a wonderful surprise.
- For me too.</i>

535
00:59:43,769 --> 00:59:46,940
<i>I must say, I find this business
of equipping you in the field...</i>

536
00:59:47,023 --> 00:59:50,110
<i>on the run, as it were...
highly irregular.</i>

537
00:59:51,445 --> 00:59:53,780
<i>Here we have a Geiger counter.</i>

538
00:59:53,864 --> 00:59:55,824
<i>Useful and unobtrusive.</i>

539
00:59:55,865 --> 00:59:58,952
<i>The sweep hand
takes the radioactivity count.</i>

540
00:59:59,036 --> 01:00:01,163
<i>- It's waterproof, of course.
- But of course.</i>

541
01:00:02,289 --> 01:00:05,876
<i>Now, here's something I want you
to use with special care.</i>

542
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:10,547
<i>- With special care.
- Everything you give me...</i>

543
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:12,798
<i>Is treated with equal contempt.
Yes, I know.</i>

544
01:00:12,882 --> 01:00:15,469
<i>But that's an underwater camera.
It takes eight pictures...</i>

545
01:00:15,510 --> 01:00:18,804
<i>in rapid succession
by pressing that button there.</i>

546
01:00:18,889 --> 01:00:20,932
<i>- Is that clever?
- If you can take pictures...</i>

547
01:00:21,016 --> 01:00:23,976
<i>in the dark with an infrared film, yes.</i>

548
01:00:27,188 --> 01:00:30,650
<i>Try to be a little less than
your usual frivolous self, 007.</i>

549
01:00:30,692 --> 01:00:33,070
<i>Here's a miniature Very pistol...</i>

550
01:00:33,152 --> 01:00:36,907
<i>which fires a bright red flare,
a distress signal.</i>

551
01:00:36,989 --> 01:00:39,742
<i>You should keep it on you
day and night.</i>

552
01:00:39,826 --> 01:00:42,746
<i>I resent that remark.</i>

553
01:00:44,248 --> 01:00:46,833
<i>Look, do you mind?</i>

554
01:00:46,916 --> 01:00:49,293
<i>Now, in the event of a re-breather
not being available...</i>

555
01:00:49,378 --> 01:00:52,255
<i>you can use this device
for short periods only, of course.</i>

556
01:00:52,338 --> 01:00:54,507
<i>Say, about four minutes.</i>

557
01:00:54,590 --> 01:00:57,844
<i>- Clever.
- You'll only use it as a last resort.</i>

558
01:00:57,885 --> 01:01:01,681
<i>It closes
to a convenient pocket size.</i>

559
01:01:01,764 --> 01:01:03,724
<i>Assuming one has a convenient pocket.</i>

560
01:01:04,726 --> 01:01:06,769
<i>Now pay attention.
A recently developed...</i>

561
01:01:06,853 --> 01:01:09,188
<i>harmless radioactive device.</i>

562
01:01:09,273 --> 01:01:10,690
<i>Harmless.</i>

563
01:01:10,731 --> 01:01:13,527
<i>It sends out a homing signal
to a special receiver.</i>

564
01:01:16,612 --> 01:01:19,574
<i>- What am I supposed to do with this?
- Obviously, you...</i>

565
01:01:19,615 --> 01:01:20,867
<i>swallow it.</i>

566
01:01:22,286 --> 01:01:23,619
<i>Now?</i>

567
01:01:27,206 --> 01:01:30,251
<i>Let's hope she'll still be lying
in the same place tonight.</i>

568
01:01:30,335 --> 01:01:34,172
<i>We'll use this catamaran
as a rendezvous place for later.</i>

569
01:01:34,255 --> 01:01:35,840
<i>Good idea.</i>

570
01:01:35,923 --> 01:01:38,217
<i>Take her in.</i>

571
01:01:38,302 --> 01:01:42,179
<i>A container will be dropped
off the coast of Burma...</i>

572
01:01:42,264 --> 01:01:44,391
<i>in the Megui Archipelago...</i>

573
01:01:44,432 --> 01:01:49,730
<i>latitude 20 degrees north,
longitude 60 degrees east...</i>

574
01:01:49,771 --> 01:01:53,400
<i>at 20 hundred hours
Greenwich mean time on May 27.</i>

575
01:01:54,818 --> 01:01:58,822
<i>It will hold blue-white
flawless diamonds between...</i>

576
01:01:58,905 --> 01:02:00,657
<i>three and eight carats.</i>

577
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:03,869
<i>Total value to be not less than
100 million pounds...</i>

578
01:02:03,952 --> 01:02:06,579
<i>present market price.</i>

579
01:02:06,663 --> 01:02:09,166
<i>After we have
recovered the container...</i>

580
01:02:09,248 --> 01:02:11,168
<i>and verified its contents...</i>

581
01:02:11,251 --> 01:02:16,005
<i>you will be notified on
radio frequency 16.23 megacycles...</i>

582
01:02:16,088 --> 01:02:18,759
<i>where the atomic bombs
may be recovered.</i>

583
01:02:20,469 --> 01:02:22,554
<i>Kenniston, you'd better get on
to De Beers at once.</i>

584
01:02:22,637 --> 01:02:24,014
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

585
01:02:24,097 --> 01:02:27,726
<i>Well, gentlemen,
unless those bombs are found...</i>

586
01:02:27,809 --> 01:02:29,936
<i>I'm very much afraid
we'll have to pay their price.</i>

587
01:02:30,019 --> 01:02:33,106
<i>- Sir?
- Oh, yes.</i>

588
01:02:33,148 --> 01:02:35,192
<i>Signal from 007 in Nassau.</i>

589
01:02:35,275 --> 01:02:37,402
<i>One or two things
that might interest us.</i>

590
01:02:37,485 --> 01:02:40,864
<i>The Disco Volante is still in the
harbor, lying off the casino channel.</i>

591
01:02:40,947 --> 01:02:43,449
<i>The catamaran is there too,
so we can use it for cover.</i>

592
01:02:43,532 --> 01:02:46,411
<i>That's fine. You can drop me
in the water behind her.</i>

593
01:02:46,494 --> 01:02:48,496
<i>- Any further news from London?
- No.</i>

594
01:02:48,579 --> 01:02:51,416
<i>Zero hour is still
20 hundred hours on the 27th.</i>

595
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:54,920
<i>- That's just 55 hours from now.
- Yes. Shall we go?</i>

596
01:02:59,173 --> 01:03:02,344
<i>- Okay, this will do here.
- We'll meet back at Pinder's.</i>

597
01:03:02,427 --> 01:03:04,012
<i>Good luck.</i>

598
01:03:57,608 --> 01:03:59,568
<i>Turn the underwater lights on.</i>

599
01:04:07,367 --> 01:04:09,327
<i>TV, closed-circuit!</i>

600
01:04:30,724 --> 01:04:32,309
<i>Hand grenades.</i>

601
01:04:34,311 --> 01:04:35,728
<i>Ready.</i>

602
01:04:43,487 --> 01:04:45,655
<i>Down there.</i>

603
01:05:00,211 --> 01:05:02,088
<i>There!</i>

604
01:05:42,336 --> 01:05:44,755
<i>Hey, there's something there!</i>

605
01:06:05,110 --> 01:06:07,362
<i>Look! Must have hit him
with the propeller.</i>

606
01:06:07,445 --> 01:06:09,364
<i>Let's get back and tell Largo.</i>

607
01:06:49,153 --> 01:06:51,072
<i>- Can I have a lift?
- Sure.</i>

608
01:06:51,155 --> 01:06:53,867
<i>Thank you.
You just about saved my life.</i>

609
01:06:54,952 --> 01:06:57,704
<i>My outboard capsized,
so I had to swim ashore.</i>

610
01:06:59,539 --> 01:07:01,458
<i>How far do you go?</i>

611
01:07:03,751 --> 01:07:05,920
<i>You better fasten your safety belt.</i>

612
01:07:08,757 --> 01:07:10,550
<i>What's your name?</i>

613
01:07:10,592 --> 01:07:12,469
<i>James Bond.</i>

614
01:07:13,552 --> 01:07:15,554
<i>Fiona Volpe.</i>

615
01:07:32,614 --> 01:07:35,742
<i>- Do you fly here often?
- Do I make you nervous?</i>

616
01:07:35,826 --> 01:07:38,286
<i>No, it's just that
I have no desire...</i>

617
01:07:38,327 --> 01:07:41,248
<i>to be capsized twice in one night.</i>

618
01:07:41,289 --> 01:07:43,791
<i>At least you won't
have to swim ashore.</i>

619
01:07:49,505 --> 01:07:51,675
<i>Have you been here before, Mr. Bond?</i>

620
01:07:51,757 --> 01:07:55,929
<i>No, I haven't.
But this is the road to Nassau?</i>

621
01:07:55,971 --> 01:07:59,016
<i>Yes, eventually.</i>

622
01:08:22,497 --> 01:08:26,167
<i>- Well, this is as far as I go.
- Me too. This is my hotel.</i>

623
01:08:26,251 --> 01:08:28,628
<i>- What a coincidence.
- Yes, so convenient.</i>

624
01:08:32,090 --> 01:08:34,717
<i>You look pale.
I hope I didn't frighten you.</i>

625
01:08:34,801 --> 01:08:36,720
<i>You see, I've always
been a nervous passenger.</i>

626
01:08:36,802 --> 01:08:38,721
<i>Some men just don't like to be driven.</i>

627
01:08:38,805 --> 01:08:41,641
<i>No, some men just don't like
to be taken for a ride.</i>

628
01:08:52,027 --> 01:08:53,487
<i>Look at this.</i>

629
01:08:53,569 --> 01:08:55,488
<i>An underwater hatch.</i>

630
01:08:55,572 --> 01:08:58,824
<i>Yeah. So that's how
they could leave and get back.</i>

631
01:08:58,867 --> 01:09:01,286
<i>Yes, and nobody saw them.
Obviously the whole operation...</i>

632
01:09:01,369 --> 01:09:03,287
<i>was carried out underwater.</i>

633
01:09:03,372 --> 01:09:05,998
<i>That's where we'll have to look
for the plane. Come on.</i>

634
01:09:06,082 --> 01:09:08,502
<i>I'll bring the prints
to the hotel when they're dry.</i>

635
01:09:15,550 --> 01:09:19,429
<i>Don't forget the Air Force searched
the area 250 miles out of Nassau.</i>

636
01:09:19,512 --> 01:09:21,597
<i>It must be beyond that radius.</i>

637
01:09:21,681 --> 01:09:24,141
<i>That's if the Disco Volante
was out that night.</i>

638
01:09:24,225 --> 01:09:27,895
<i>Sure she was, but harbor control
said for only six hours.</i>

639
01:09:29,523 --> 01:09:33,777
<i>She couldn't cover 500 miles
in that time, no.</i>

640
01:09:33,859 --> 01:09:37,613
<i>About 90 miles is her limit for
six hours, and that's out and back.</i>

641
01:09:41,909 --> 01:09:45,497
<i>I reckon we've got to go further out.
We'll need more gas for that.</i>

642
01:09:45,581 --> 01:09:47,916
<i>All right.
Let's get back to Nassau.</i>

643
01:09:47,957 --> 01:09:51,377
<i>- We haven't got much time.
- You're right, we haven't.</i>

644
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:11,689
<i>Pull!</i>

645
01:10:11,773 --> 01:10:13,859
<i>Of course they are watching us.</i>

646
01:10:13,942 --> 01:10:16,778
<i>What else have they to do?</i>

647
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:23,118
<i>- You would like Bond dead?
- I can think of no better arrangement.</i>

648
01:10:23,159 --> 01:10:26,496
<i>Because he tries to make love
to your woman?</i>

649
01:10:26,579 --> 01:10:30,500
<i>Because he is Bond, and as an enemy
of Spectre, he should be killed.</i>

650
01:10:30,583 --> 01:10:31,877
<i>Mark!</i>

651
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:36,088
<i>If Bond had died last night
as a result of your hastiness...</i>

652
01:10:36,131 --> 01:10:39,967
<i>his government would have known
for certain that the bombs are here.</i>

653
01:10:40,010 --> 01:10:43,220
<i>When the time is right,
he will be killed. Pull!</i>

654
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:48,185
<i>I shall kill him.</i>

655
01:10:52,189 --> 01:10:55,775
<i>A separate pool.
For sharks, no less. Move in.</i>

656
01:10:57,527 --> 01:10:59,488
<i>Hold on that line.</i>

657
01:11:02,532 --> 01:11:05,618
<i>That's Largo's place, all right.
My next port of call.</i>

658
01:11:26,265 --> 01:11:27,975
<i>- Mr. Largo?
- Yes, sir.</i>

659
01:11:28,015 --> 01:11:29,309
<i>Thank you.</i>

660
01:11:46,158 --> 01:11:49,496
<i>- Can I help?
- Why, Mr. Bond.</i>

661
01:11:49,537 --> 01:11:52,498
<i>- Of course you can.
- That looks particularly inviting.</i>

662
01:11:54,626 --> 01:11:56,920
<i>- Welcome to Palmyra.
- It's a pleasure.</i>

663
01:11:57,003 --> 01:11:59,381
<i>I just hope I'm not
interrupting anything.</i>

664
01:11:59,422 --> 01:12:02,050
<i>- What do you mean?
- I thought you had another visitor.</i>

665
01:12:05,886 --> 01:12:09,181
<i>That gun, it looks
more fitting for a woman.</i>

666
01:12:09,224 --> 01:12:11,518
<i>You know much about guns?</i>

667
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:14,145
<i>No. I know a little about women.</i>

668
01:12:15,564 --> 01:12:19,568
<i>Mr. Jenni, Mr. Vargas.
Mr. Vargas, Mr. Jenni.</i>

669
01:12:19,650 --> 01:12:22,320
<i>- Which is which?
- I thought you might have met...</i>

670
01:12:22,404 --> 01:12:24,323
<i>Mr. Vargas the other night.</i>

671
01:12:25,990 --> 01:12:29,161
<i>- Yes, I believe I did.
- Drink, sir?</i>

672
01:12:29,243 --> 01:12:32,331
<i>- Rum Collins?
- Yes.</i>

673
01:12:32,413 --> 01:12:34,498
<i>Just about that hour, isn't it?</i>

674
01:12:34,582 --> 01:12:37,961
<i>For you? Of course!</i>

675
01:12:38,045 --> 01:12:40,338
<i>Vargas does not drink,
does not smoke...</i>

676
01:12:41,672 --> 01:12:44,051
<i>does not make love.</i>

677
01:12:44,091 --> 01:12:49,180
<i>What do you do, Vargas?
Every man has his passion.</i>

678
01:12:49,264 --> 01:12:51,182
<i>Mine is fishing.</i>

679
01:12:52,559 --> 01:12:54,810
<i>What is yours, Mr. Bond?</i>

680
01:12:54,895 --> 01:12:57,939
<i>Well, I'm not what you'd call
a passionate man.</i>

681
01:13:04,695 --> 01:13:07,114
<i>I think it's time I went to change.</i>

682
01:13:08,574 --> 01:13:10,993
<i>You must let me show you around.</i>

683
01:13:11,078 --> 01:13:15,332
<i>- I'd love that.
- I thought you might.</i>

684
01:13:15,414 --> 01:13:17,042
<i>Pull!</i>

685
01:13:17,125 --> 01:13:20,462
<i>- What could be easier?
- Perhaps you would call one for me?</i>

686
01:13:20,503 --> 01:13:23,047
<i>- Of course. Pull!
- It seems terribly difficult.</i>

687
01:13:26,551 --> 01:13:28,511
<i>No, it isn't, is it?</i>

688
01:13:34,725 --> 01:13:38,521
<i>I collect big game fish
for various marine institutions.</i>

689
01:13:38,604 --> 01:13:40,524
<i>Magnificent creatures!</i>

690
01:13:41,984 --> 01:13:43,277
<i>Charming.</i>

691
01:13:43,318 --> 01:13:45,279
<i>The notorious Golden Grotto sharks.</i>

692
01:13:45,319 --> 01:13:47,905
<i>The most savage, the most dangerous.</i>

693
01:13:47,989 --> 01:13:49,908
<i>They know when it's time
for them to be fed.</i>

694
01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:55,454
<i>- That boat, is she yours?
- Yes. I'm very proud of her.</i>

695
01:13:55,497 --> 01:13:58,166
<i>What does she do, about 15 knots?</i>

696
01:13:58,250 --> 01:14:01,127
<i>Better than that. Near 20.</i>

697
01:14:01,168 --> 01:14:05,172
<i>- Perhaps you'd like to see over her?
- Yes, I would very much.</i>

698
01:14:05,256 --> 01:14:07,967
<i>- Lunch is ready.
- Thank you, my darling.</i>

699
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:10,845
<i>Come along, Mr. Bond.
The conch chowder smells delicious.</i>

700
01:14:10,929 --> 01:14:13,180
<i>Domino, I was just thinking.</i>

701
01:14:13,265 --> 01:14:16,726
<i>As I'll be busy this evening,
perhaps Mr. Bond will be kind enough...</i>

702
01:14:16,810 --> 01:14:20,314
<i>to take you to the Jankanoo,
our local Mardi Gras.</i>

703
01:14:20,354 --> 01:14:22,315
<i>You'll be my guest tonight.</i>

704
01:14:22,356 --> 01:14:24,693
<i>- That's very kind of you.
- It will be my pleasure.</i>

705
01:14:34,453 --> 01:14:36,997
<i>Our Mr. Bond must have
a very high opinion of himself.</i>

706
01:14:37,079 --> 01:14:38,289
<i>Opinion?</i>

707
01:14:38,372 --> 01:14:41,918
<i>Yes. He has a date with me too.</i>

708
01:14:45,296 --> 01:14:46,631
<i>Excuse me.</i>

709
01:15:03,064 --> 01:15:05,943
<i>- Let me go!
- Over here.</i>

710
01:15:09,195 --> 01:15:12,240
<i>Don't let her make so much noise.
Use the chloroform.</i>

711
01:15:44,605 --> 01:15:46,942
<i>Largo did promise
he'd come, didn't he?</i>

712
01:15:47,984 --> 01:15:50,779
<i>He'll be here. Don't worry.</i>

713
01:15:50,862 --> 01:15:53,282
<i>I think that man is waving at you.</i>

714
01:15:53,364 --> 01:15:54,865
<i>Come down here.</i>

715
01:15:56,368 --> 01:15:57,786
<i>Quick!</i>

716
01:15:59,328 --> 01:16:01,707
<i>Excuse me for a second.</i>

717
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:06,377
<i>- James, Paula's gone!
- What do you mean, gone?</i>

718
01:16:06,461 --> 01:16:08,380
<i>She just checked out of the hotel.</i>

719
01:16:09,672 --> 01:16:11,632
<i>You look after Domino. Watch her.</i>

720
01:16:11,675 --> 01:16:15,011
<i>- Do you think she was onto something?
- I don't know, but I gotta find out.</i>

721
01:16:15,095 --> 01:16:17,014
<i>- You watch out for her.
- Right.</i>

722
01:16:17,096 --> 01:16:19,015
<i>All right. Thank you.</i>

723
01:16:19,975 --> 01:16:21,893
<i>The governor's not very happy,
but you'll have...</i>

724
01:16:21,976 --> 01:16:24,186
<i>a power cut as requested
all over the island.</i>

725
01:16:24,270 --> 01:16:26,273
<i>I don't give a damn
about the rest of the island.</i>

726
01:16:26,314 --> 01:16:28,774
<i>- I want the lights out in Palmyra.
- You'll have it.</i>

727
01:16:58,137 --> 01:17:00,222
<i>What do you mean, she won't talk?</i>

728
01:17:00,306 --> 01:17:02,559
<i>Don't worry, she will.</i>

729
01:17:02,643 --> 01:17:04,560
<i>What's wrong?</i>

730
01:17:09,608 --> 01:17:12,109
<i>- Is it a power failure?
- Yes, all over the island.</i>

731
01:17:12,194 --> 01:17:14,988
<i>Switch over
to the emergency generator.</i>

732
01:17:52,568 --> 01:17:54,528
<i>Largo told you to be careful.</i>

733
01:17:55,319 --> 01:17:58,323
<i>I didn't kill her.
She must have taken some poison.</i>

734
01:17:58,407 --> 01:18:01,201
<i>A capsule in the mouth.
What do you think, cyanide?</i>

735
01:18:03,078 --> 01:18:05,497
<i>She's dead.</i>

736
01:18:22,221 --> 01:18:24,140
<i>Ricardo, someone's got him!</i>

737
01:18:32,356 --> 01:18:34,775
<i>Search that way!
And you, the shark pool!</i>

738
01:18:39,614 --> 01:18:41,490
<i>- What happened?
- I don't know.</i>

739
01:18:41,574 --> 01:18:43,368
<i>Leave him! This way!</i>

740
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:51,376
<i>Stop it!</i>

741
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:55,087
<i>You fools! He's got
you all shooting at each other!</i>

742
01:19:05,474 --> 01:19:07,184
<i>Over here!</i>

743
01:19:40,216 --> 01:19:42,551
<i>No! I've got a better idea.</i>

744
01:20:00,487 --> 01:20:03,030
<i>Lift the tunnel hatch
and let them eat.</i>

745
01:20:03,114 --> 01:20:04,533
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

746
01:21:16,771 --> 01:21:19,440
<i>Sorry, old chap.
Better luck next time.</i>

747
01:21:26,239 --> 01:21:29,952
<i>Tell Leiter to stay with the girl.
I'll get back to him as soon as I can.</i>

748
01:21:30,034 --> 01:21:32,496
<i>- Anything else?
- Tell him Paula's dead.</i>

749
01:22:13,953 --> 01:22:15,872
<i>Aren't you in the wrong room?</i>

750
01:22:16,998 --> 01:22:19,251
<i>Not from where I'm standing.</i>

751
01:22:20,668 --> 01:22:23,212
<i>Since you're here, would you mind
giving me something to put on?</i>

752
01:22:39,645 --> 01:22:41,899
<i>Anyway, I'm very glad to see you again.</i>

753
01:22:41,981 --> 01:22:44,275
<i>I'm glad to see you again.</i>

754
01:22:44,359 --> 01:22:46,819
<i>I had the feeling
you've been avoiding me.</i>

755
01:22:46,862 --> 01:22:50,407
<i>I had no idea that
we were next-door neighbors.</i>

756
01:22:50,489 --> 01:22:52,909
<i>They just moved me down
this afternoon.</i>

757
01:22:52,993 --> 01:22:55,746
<i>It's extraordinary, isn't it?
Almost as if...</i>

758
01:22:55,828 --> 01:22:57,914
<i>As if it was intended.</i>

759
01:22:57,997 --> 01:23:01,042
<i>Yes, it is extraordinary.</i>

760
01:23:01,126 --> 01:23:03,795
<i>Shouldn't you get out
of those wet clothes?</i>

761
01:23:03,878 --> 01:23:06,840
<i>You'll catch your death of cold.</i>

762
01:23:14,139 --> 01:23:16,891
<i>Look, you know
we're going to be too late.</i>

763
01:23:16,934 --> 01:23:19,810
<i>- Too late for what?
- The Jankanoo.</i>

764
01:23:19,895 --> 01:23:22,230
<i>I promised my friends
I'd meet them there.</i>

765
01:23:22,271 --> 01:23:24,733
<i>Perhaps you know them, the Largos.</i>

766
01:23:26,109 --> 01:23:29,238
<i>Questions. All I get is questions.</i>

767
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:31,989
<i>But the music is gonna
go on all night anyhow.</i>

768
01:23:32,073 --> 01:23:35,911
<i>Enough to drive you wild.
Do you like wild things?</i>

769
01:23:39,247 --> 01:23:42,583
<i>Wild. You should be
locked up in a cage.</i>

770
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:50,884
<i>This bed feels like a cage.</i>

771
01:23:50,926 --> 01:23:53,052
<i>All these bars.</i>

772
01:23:53,095 --> 01:23:56,974
<i>Do you think I'll be safe?</i>

773
01:24:08,234 --> 01:24:12,072
<i>You made a shocking mess out of
my hair, you sadistic brute.</i>

774
01:24:12,113 --> 01:24:14,574
<i>Will you zip me up, please?</i>

775
01:24:17,452 --> 01:24:20,079
<i>No wonder you can
get dressed so quickly.</i>

776
01:24:20,162 --> 01:24:22,666
<i>On the way, we can have a little talk.</i>

777
01:24:22,748 --> 01:24:26,127
<i>You may find it interesting. Come on.</i>

778
01:24:26,168 --> 01:24:27,628
<i>I'm coming.</i>

779
01:24:27,712 --> 01:24:29,715
<i>I hate to think
I'm gonna miss anything.</i>

780
01:24:33,217 --> 01:24:35,970
<i>And now we can go somewhere
for an interesting talk.</i>

781
01:24:36,054 --> 01:24:39,181
<i>Friends of yours, no doubt. Come in.</i>

782
01:24:42,144 --> 01:24:44,395
<i>You dress quickly too.
I didn't see that gun in the mirror.</i>

783
01:24:46,314 --> 01:24:49,902
<i>Not that it matters, but that
was under the pillow all the time.</i>

784
01:24:51,987 --> 01:24:54,363
<i>When did you find out?</i>

785
01:24:54,448 --> 01:24:56,992
<i>You're wearing the same ring
as Largo.</i>

786
01:24:58,618 --> 01:25:01,579
<i>- It's a ring I like to wear.
- Then it has its dangers.</i>

787
01:25:02,456 --> 01:25:04,332
<i>Vanity, Mr. Bond.</i>

788
01:25:04,373 --> 01:25:07,336
<i>- It's something you know so much about.
- My dear girl.</i>

789
01:25:07,418 --> 01:25:11,088
<i>Don't flatter yourself. What I did
this evening was for King and Country.</i>

790
01:25:11,172 --> 01:25:14,176
<i>You don't think it gave me
any pleasure, do you?</i>

791
01:25:19,389 --> 01:25:21,432
<i>But of course.
I forgot your ego.</i>

792
01:25:21,515 --> 01:25:25,436
<i>James Bond, who only has
to make love to a woman...</i>

793
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:28,356
<i>and she starts to hear
heavenly choirs singing.</i>

794
01:25:28,398 --> 01:25:32,694
<i>She repents and immediately returns
to the side of right and virtue.</i>

795
01:25:34,363 --> 01:25:36,323
<i>But not this one.</i>

796
01:25:38,158 --> 01:25:42,537
<i>What a blow it must have been,
you having a failure.</i>

797
01:25:42,621 --> 01:25:45,707
<i>Well, you can't win them all.</i>

798
01:25:47,042 --> 01:25:49,670
<i>We'll take him out the front way.
Go and get the car.</i>

799
01:25:49,752 --> 01:25:51,712
<i>Careful, Mr. Bond.</i>

800
01:26:08,396 --> 01:26:09,855
<i>Now what?</i>

801
01:26:12,818 --> 01:26:17,113
<i>Get through to Palmyra and tell them
we've been held up by the Jankanoo.</i>

802
01:26:17,197 --> 01:26:19,198
<i>- Like to have a drink, man?
- Get him away!</i>

803
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:21,368
<i>- Don't you try anything now.
- Get out of here!</i>

804
01:26:21,409 --> 01:26:24,871
<i>- It's real firewater.
- Get out of here!</i>

805
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:35,172
<i>After him! Get him!</i>

806
01:26:52,106 --> 01:26:54,192
<i>You haven't seen anything?</i>

807
01:26:54,275 --> 01:26:55,944
<i>Look!</i>

808
01:26:56,028 --> 01:26:59,238
<i>Follow him. You that side, you there.</i>

809
01:28:01,842 --> 01:28:03,095
<i>Stay with us.</i>

810
01:30:01,963 --> 01:30:04,091
<i>- Thank you, I'd love to.
- Love to what?</i>

811
01:30:07,970 --> 01:30:11,806
<i>- You're mad. Do you know that?
- Yes. Isn't everyone?</i>

812
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:17,479
<i>May I cut in?</i>

813
01:30:17,563 --> 01:30:19,605
<i>You should have told me
your wife was here.</i>

814
01:30:31,158 --> 01:30:33,203
<i>Do you come here often?</i>

815
01:30:33,287 --> 01:30:36,914
<i>It's no good trying to escape.</i>

816
01:30:36,998 --> 01:30:38,917
<i>I don't want to escape.</i>

817
01:30:40,460 --> 01:30:44,256
<i>Strange as it may seem,
I've grown accustomed to your face.</i>

818
01:30:54,850 --> 01:30:58,436
<i>Why don't you come with us quietly?</i>

819
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:02,024
<i>You don't seem to understand.
You see, I enjoy my dancing.</i>

820
01:31:41,063 --> 01:31:45,024
<i>Do you mind if my friend
sits this one out? She's just dead.</i>

821
01:31:55,743 --> 01:32:00,582
<i>You'll leave here at 0600 hours
and land at Aden to refuel.</i>

822
01:32:00,666 --> 01:32:03,252
<i>You will then proceed
to the Megui Archipelago...</i>

823
01:32:03,335 --> 01:32:06,003
<i>to make your drop precisely at...</i>

824
01:32:06,087 --> 01:32:08,881
<i>20 degrees north,
60 degrees east.</i>

825
01:32:08,923 --> 01:32:11,426
<i>The diamonds will be
in a special container.</i>

826
01:32:11,510 --> 01:32:13,552
<i>I hate to give in like this.</i>

827
01:32:13,595 --> 01:32:16,430
<i>Paying the blood money,
letting them beat us.</i>

828
01:32:16,472 --> 01:32:19,560
<i>- Have you an alternative suggestion?
- I'm afraid I haven't.</i>

829
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:22,604
<i>Your man, 007,
I thought he was on to something.</i>

830
01:32:22,688 --> 01:32:24,814
<i>- I thought so too, sir.
- False alarm?</i>

831
01:32:24,898 --> 01:32:26,817
<i>- I'm afraid so.
- He obviously has...</i>

832
01:32:26,899 --> 01:32:29,485
<i>a highly developed sense of,
shall we say, drama?</i>

833
01:32:29,569 --> 01:32:31,822
<i>If 007 thought
he was on to something...</i>

834
01:32:31,904 --> 01:32:34,783
<i>It's a great pity he didn't make sure
before he started to shout the odds.</i>

835
01:32:34,824 --> 01:32:37,618
<i>Well, we have exactly
14 hours and 50 minutes.</i>

836
01:32:37,703 --> 01:32:41,747
<i>Then I suppose we shall have to pay up
and look as happy as we can. Shan't we?</i>

837
01:33:19,411 --> 01:33:22,122
<i>Well, that's it, James.
We've looked about everywhere.</i>

838
01:33:22,163 --> 01:33:25,000
<i>We've got to find that plane.</i>

839
01:33:26,585 --> 01:33:29,796
<i>You won't find it down there.
That's the Golden Grotto.</i>

840
01:33:31,422 --> 01:33:34,509
<i>- Golden Grotto?
- Yeah. All you'll find...</i>

841
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:36,511
<i>down there are sharks.</i>

842
01:33:37,595 --> 01:33:39,805
<i>Take her down. I want a closer look.</i>

843
01:33:39,847 --> 01:33:42,184
<i>- At what?
- Never mind! Take her down, quick!</i>

844
01:33:49,524 --> 01:33:51,652
<i>Set her down.
I think we've found it.</i>

845
01:34:03,704 --> 01:34:07,708
<i>There's something camouflaged
down there. I'll take a look.</i>

846
01:34:07,792 --> 01:34:11,046
<i>Shoot one of those sharks.
It'll keep the others occupied.</i>

847
01:34:21,055 --> 01:34:24,393
<i>I don't know how long the others
will take before they finish him off...</i>

848
01:34:24,475 --> 01:34:26,603
<i>- but they'll be back.
- I'll keep an eye on them.</i>

849
01:34:26,686 --> 01:34:28,145
<i>Good.</i>

850
01:36:39,653 --> 01:36:42,072
<i>- She's down there, all right.
- Are the bombs on board?</i>

851
01:36:42,154 --> 01:36:45,408
<i>- No.
- Great. What's our next move?</i>

852
01:36:45,492 --> 01:36:47,411
<i>We'll check on the Disco Volante.</i>

853
01:36:47,493 --> 01:36:49,579
<i>If the bombs aren't aboard her now,
they soon will be.</i>

854
01:36:49,662 --> 01:36:52,164
<i>Who are you going to ask, Largo?</i>

855
01:36:52,248 --> 01:36:55,335
<i>No, I don't think we'll have to.</i>

856
01:37:49,180 --> 01:37:51,225
<i>I hope we didn't frighten the fish.</i>

857
01:37:54,101 --> 01:37:58,314
<i>Ow! Sea egg spines.
They're poisonous!</i>

858
01:37:58,398 --> 01:38:01,068
<i>Here, give me your arm.</i>

859
01:38:03,403 --> 01:38:04,863
<i>Sit down.</i>

860
01:38:06,530 --> 01:38:08,449
<i>Now turn over.</i>

861
01:38:10,953 --> 01:38:12,912
<i>This is going to hurt a bit.</i>

862
01:38:22,296 --> 01:38:24,548
<i>It's the first time I've
tasted women. They're rather good.</i>

863
01:38:24,632 --> 01:38:27,301
<i>You're the only man
to ever make me cry.</i>

864
01:38:27,386 --> 01:38:30,555
<i>Except perhaps Francois,
my brother, when we were children.</i>

865
01:38:30,639 --> 01:38:33,559
<i>Domino, I have to tell you something.</i>

866
01:38:35,394 --> 01:38:39,189
<i>I'm sorry, James. I didn't mean
to embarrass you, speaking of love.</i>

867
01:38:39,273 --> 01:38:42,859
<i>- I must hurt you again.
- You're going away?</i>

868
01:38:42,943 --> 01:38:45,820
<i>So sorry, my dear, but it's all over.</i>

869
01:38:45,862 --> 01:38:47,823
<i>No, it's about your brother.</i>

870
01:38:47,863 --> 01:38:49,824
<i>What about him?</i>

871
01:39:15,850 --> 01:39:17,269
<i>He's dead.</i>

872
01:39:21,523 --> 01:39:23,024
<i>What happened?</i>

873
01:39:23,108 --> 01:39:27,820
<i>It's a long story,
and it involves your friend Largo.</i>

874
01:39:39,041 --> 01:39:41,376
<i>I need your help.</i>

875
01:39:41,460 --> 01:39:43,712
<i>Of course.</i>

876
01:39:43,795 --> 01:39:45,713
<i>That's why you made love to me.</i>

877
01:39:45,796 --> 01:39:48,550
<i>Look, I can't explain
what this is all about.</i>

878
01:39:48,634 --> 01:39:51,761
<i>- But you must trust me.
- Because you want me to help you?</i>

879
01:39:51,845 --> 01:39:54,514
<i>Largo had your brother murdered,
or it was on his orders.</i>

880
01:39:54,555 --> 01:39:58,018
<i>Hundreds of thousands of people
will die very soon...</i>

881
01:39:58,060 --> 01:40:00,854
<i>if you don't help me.</i>

882
01:40:04,733 --> 01:40:07,778
<i>That much we do know,
but there's something we don't...</i>

883
01:40:07,860 --> 01:40:11,323
<i>The bombs, when they're being loaded
aboard the Disco Volante.</i>

884
01:40:11,405 --> 01:40:14,326
<i>- How could I know that?
- That you'll have to find out.</i>

885
01:40:16,787 --> 01:40:19,747
<i>It won't be easy.
It could be very dangerous.</i>

886
01:40:19,831 --> 01:40:22,333
<i>What can he do to me
he hasn't already done?</i>

887
01:40:22,417 --> 01:40:24,211
<i>Then you'll do it?</i>

888
01:40:26,462 --> 01:40:28,006
<i>- Yes.
- Good.</i>

889
01:40:29,382 --> 01:40:32,261
<i>This is a Geiger counter.
You press this lever.</i>

890
01:40:32,344 --> 01:40:34,470
<i>If it starts clicking,
it means the bombs are aboard.</i>

891
01:40:35,555 --> 01:40:37,975
<i>- What do I do then?
- Go straight up on deck.</i>

892
01:40:38,057 --> 01:40:41,019
<i>As the Disco Volante is being watched,
you'll be spotted.</i>

893
01:40:41,103 --> 01:40:42,604
<i>Vargas, behind you.</i>

894
01:40:45,106 --> 01:40:46,733
<i>Really?</i>

895
01:40:48,443 --> 01:40:51,154
<i>He must have followed us.</i>

896
01:40:55,867 --> 01:40:57,786
<i>I think he got the point.</i>

897
01:40:57,868 --> 01:41:00,413
<i>It should have been Largo.</i>

898
01:41:00,454 --> 01:41:03,375
<i>Largo? When did he expect you back?</i>

899
01:41:03,457 --> 01:41:07,296
<i>Very soon now. He said not to be late.
He was most insistent.</i>

900
01:41:08,796 --> 01:41:11,591
<i>You better go straight back. I'll take
care of Vargas and everything here.</i>

901
01:41:11,632 --> 01:41:15,636
<i>Understand I'm doing this for
my brother, for what he did to him.</i>

902
01:41:15,720 --> 01:41:19,056
<i>But promise you will kill Largo
for me, whatever happens.</i>

903
01:41:24,145 --> 01:41:26,105
<i>- We haven't much time.
- All right.</i>

904
01:41:26,148 --> 01:41:29,109
<i>Oh, something I remembered.
It may not be important.</i>

905
01:41:29,150 --> 01:41:31,485
<i>- Tell me. Everything's important.
- There's a small bridge over the canal.</i>

906
01:41:31,569 --> 01:41:34,780
<i>Largo never allows strangers
to go near it.</i>

907
01:41:34,823 --> 01:41:36,992
<i>By the canal there's a flight of steps.</i>

908
01:41:37,074 --> 01:41:39,286
<i>- Where do they lead to?
- Down into the sea...</i>

909
01:41:39,328 --> 01:41:41,537
<i>on the far side of Palmyra.</i>

910
01:41:41,622 --> 01:41:44,041
<i>Perhaps it is important after all.</i>

911
01:43:14,922 --> 01:43:17,091
<i>Put on your equipment.</i>

912
01:43:34,109 --> 01:43:36,403
<i>Did we get a message saying the girl
went on board the Disco?</i>

913
01:43:36,444 --> 01:43:38,529
<i>Yes, sir. Signal received at...</i>

914
01:43:38,613 --> 01:43:41,365
<i>- If she is on board, where is 007 now?
- That's the question.</i>

915
01:43:44,368 --> 01:43:47,122
<i>Stand by. Five seconds.</i>

916
01:43:47,204 --> 01:43:49,416
<i>Watch my signal.</i>

917
01:44:33,961 --> 01:44:37,046
<i>- Prepare to get underway.
- Aye, aye, sir.</i>

918
01:44:40,466 --> 01:44:42,761
<i>Captain, weigh anchor.</i>

919
01:44:42,844 --> 01:44:45,180
<i>Get underway immediately.</i>

920
01:44:45,221 --> 01:44:49,059
<i>Once we pick up the merchandise,
head for our target area, Miami.</i>

921
01:44:57,609 --> 01:44:59,528
<i>The Disco Volante's leaving, sir.</i>

922
01:49:08,443 --> 01:49:11,238
<i>- I told you to stay in your cabin.
- It's stuffy in there.</i>

923
01:49:11,279 --> 01:49:14,490
<i>- I want a breath of air.
- My dear, did you not hear me?</i>

924
01:49:14,574 --> 01:49:16,493
<i>- Where did you get that?
- I bought it this morning.</i>

925
01:49:16,577 --> 01:49:19,662
<i>- Let me see.
- No. Why should I?</i>

926
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:30,256
<i>Mr. Bond gave you this little toy,
I imagine, and Vargas is dead.</i>

927
01:49:34,469 --> 01:49:36,846
<i>No, my dear.
There is no escape for you.</i>

928
01:49:36,930 --> 01:49:39,557
<i>Like your friend,
you've been a little too clever.</i>

929
01:49:39,640 --> 01:49:41,518
<i>And now you are caught!</i>

930
01:50:29,358 --> 01:50:33,110
<i>You have given me
much pleasure, Domino.</i>

931
01:50:33,194 --> 01:50:37,323
<i>But in return, unless you tell me
how much Bond knows...</i>

932
01:50:37,365 --> 01:50:40,284
<i>I'll be forced to cause you great pain.</i>

933
01:50:40,368 --> 01:50:44,288
<i>This for heat, these for cold.</i>

934
01:50:44,372 --> 01:50:48,502
<i>Applied scientifically and slowly.</i>

935
01:50:48,542 --> 01:50:51,380
<i>Very, very slowly.</i>

936
01:51:02,056 --> 01:51:04,976
<i>- What do you want?
- We're activating the bombs.</i>

937
01:51:05,060 --> 01:51:07,395
<i>- You said you wanted to be told.
- Oh, yes.</i>

938
01:51:09,355 --> 01:51:13,318
<i>A private little matter between
the young woman and myself.</i>

939
01:51:13,402 --> 01:51:15,362
<i>Go!</i>

940
01:51:15,404 --> 01:51:19,699
<i>Do not live in hope, my dear.
There is no one to rescue you.</i>

941
01:51:34,881 --> 01:51:36,466
<i>Now go on!</i>

942
01:51:36,550 --> 01:51:39,386
<i>It's a good thing
the homing capsule he swallowed...</i>

943
01:51:39,427 --> 01:51:40,679
<i>is still working.</i>

944
01:51:40,761 --> 01:51:41,930
<i>Straight ahead.</i>

945
01:51:47,435 --> 01:51:49,563
<i>Go right.</i>

946
01:52:10,708 --> 01:52:12,627
<i>That's him!</i>

947
01:52:28,143 --> 01:52:29,770
<i>Hold it!</i>

948
01:52:39,654 --> 01:52:41,198
<i>Up.</i>

949
01:52:55,420 --> 01:52:58,923
<i>Get your radio man
on to Orlando Beach.</i>

950
01:52:59,006 --> 01:53:01,426
<i>Warn them the target is Miami.</i>

951
01:53:01,510 --> 01:53:04,555
<i>Also, the bomb is transferred
from the Disco Volante...</i>

952
01:53:04,637 --> 01:53:06,847
<i>onto a wreck off Fowley Point.</i>

953
01:53:06,931 --> 01:53:08,850
<i>Right. Hang on to that.</i>

954
01:55:57,728 --> 01:55:59,729
<i>And the kitchen sink.</i>

955
01:55:59,813 --> 01:56:02,440
<i>On you, everything looks good.</i>

956
01:56:02,524 --> 01:56:04,443
<i>Take this.</i>

957
01:56:09,488 --> 01:56:11,408
<i>Good luck.</i>

958
02:03:16,041 --> 02:03:18,126
<i>- Weigh anchor!
- Aye, aye, sir.</i>

959
02:03:46,279 --> 02:03:49,073
<i>- Make smoke.
- Making smoke now.</i>

960
02:03:56,247 --> 02:03:59,835
<i>- Stand by for conversion.
- Standing by.</i>

961
02:04:03,546 --> 02:04:05,716
<i>Jettison cocoon.</i>

962
02:04:12,847 --> 02:04:14,682
<i>Cocoon's away.</i>

963
02:04:27,445 --> 02:04:30,573
<i>Keep firing! They're closing!</i>

964
02:04:50,051 --> 02:04:52,304
<i>Fire more, more!</i>

965
02:05:05,524 --> 02:05:07,985
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

966
02:05:08,069 --> 02:05:10,655
<i>We've still got one bomb aboard.</i>

967
02:05:10,738 --> 02:05:15,368
<i>He's gone mad!
Please talk to them for me.</i>

968
02:05:15,409 --> 02:05:18,956
<i>Tell them that I only did what
I had to do, what I was told to do.</i>

969
02:05:31,842 --> 02:05:35,721
<i>- Where is he?
- The bomb cannot be exploded now.</i>

970
02:05:35,805 --> 02:05:37,807
<i>I threw the arming device
into the sea.</i>

971
02:05:37,890 --> 02:05:39,810
<i>- Do you understand?
- Yes.</i>

972
02:05:48,777 --> 02:05:50,319
<i>Get him!</i>

973
02:07:34,841 --> 02:07:38,595
<i>- I'm glad I killed him.
- You're glad?</i>

974
02:07:38,679 --> 02:07:41,097
<i>- Who's he?
- I don't know, but he helped me.</i>

975
02:07:42,599 --> 02:07:45,685
<i>- Look out! The rocks!
- The reef!</i>

976
02:07:47,604 --> 02:07:49,898
<i>He's jammed the controls!
Come on!</i>

977
02:07:49,981 --> 02:07:51,899
<i>- Come on, now, jump!
- I never learned to swim!</i>

978
02:07:51,984 --> 02:07:54,194
<i>Never too late to learn.</i>

979
02:07:57,197 --> 02:07:59,365
<i>Get down!</i>

980
02:08:25,100 --> 02:08:26,310
<i>Up.</i>

981
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:30,061
