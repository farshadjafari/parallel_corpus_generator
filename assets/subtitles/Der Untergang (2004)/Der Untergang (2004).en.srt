1
00:00:25,078 --> 00:00:30,813
I feel as if I should be angry
with that child, that...

2
00:00:31,334 --> 00:00:35,505
naive young girl.
Or that I must not forgive her...

3
00:00:36,026 --> 00:00:39,676
for not recognising the
nature of that monster.

4
00:00:40,718 --> 00:00:43,638
For not being aware of what
she was getting into.

5
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:47,809
And especially that I went
along without thinking.

6
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:54,586
Because I wasn't a fanatical Nazi.
I could have said, in Berlin:

7
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:59,278
'No, I'm not doing it. I don't want
to go to the Führer's headquarters.'

8
00:01:00,321 --> 00:01:03,450
But I didn't do that.
I was too curious.

9
00:01:03,972 --> 00:01:07,100
I also didn't realise...

10
00:01:08,143 --> 00:01:13,356
that destiny would take me somewhere
I didn't want to be.

11
00:01:14,399 --> 00:01:20,134
But, nevertheless, I find it hard
to forgive myself.

12
00:01:26,206 --> 00:01:27,249
The ladies are here.

13
00:01:29,335 --> 00:01:32,984
It's confirmed.
-They can pass.

14
00:02:02,054 --> 00:02:05,182
'Wolfsschanze'
headquarters of the Führer

15
00:02:06,225 --> 00:02:07,789
November 1942
Rastenburg, East-Prussia

16
00:02:11,438 --> 00:02:13,524
Sit down, ladies.

17
00:02:15,088 --> 00:02:20,301
One moment. The Führer is feeding
his dog. He'll see you in a short while.

18
00:02:22,387 --> 00:02:27,079
Can you tell us... How are we supposed
to address the Führer?

19
00:02:28,121 --> 00:02:32,292
The Führer first speaks to you
and then you reply: Heil, mein Führer.

20
00:02:32,293 --> 00:02:34,378
And the Nazi salute?

21
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:36,985
That won't be necessary...

22
00:02:36,986 --> 00:02:42,198
since the Führer isn't looking for
a soldier, but for a secretary.

23
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:45,326
Act as normal and calm
as you can.

24
00:02:46,369 --> 00:02:48,454
I'll see if
he has time for you.

25
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:55,753
Mein Führer,
the ladies from Berlin are here.

26
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:20,263
Thank you for coming
in the middle of the night.

27
00:03:20,785 --> 00:03:25,477
Sometimes, during a war,
one is not in control of time.

28
00:03:27,483 --> 00:03:31,132
Can I ask your name?
-Margarethe Lorenz.

29
00:03:31,654 --> 00:03:34,261
Where are you from?
-From Fulda.

30
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:38,431
And what is your name?
-Ursula Puttkammer. Heil, mein Führer.

31
00:03:38,953 --> 00:03:42,081
No need for that.
Where are you from?

32
00:03:42,602 --> 00:03:44,688
Frankfurt am Main, mein Füh...

33
00:03:46,773 --> 00:03:48,858
Hannah Potrovsky,
born and raised in Berlin.

34
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:51,987
In Pankow, to be precise.

35
00:03:53,029 --> 00:03:55,636
Hedwig Brandt
from Crailsheim, Schwaben.

36
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,850
And you are?
-Traudl Humps. I'm from Munich.

37
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:05,542
A lady from Munich.

38
00:04:12,841 --> 00:04:16,490
Shall we start then,
Fräulein Humps?

39
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:31,088
My Blondi won't hurt you.
She's very intelligent.

40
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,259
She's much smarter
than most people.

41
00:04:39,951 --> 00:04:43,079
First, sit down, please.

42
00:04:43,601 --> 00:04:47,772
Don't be nervous. I make
many mistakes during dictation.

43
00:04:47,773 --> 00:04:51,421
You won't make nearly as many.

44
00:05:00,805 --> 00:05:02,369
You're very young.

45
00:05:02,371 --> 00:05:07,584
How old are you?
-22, mein Führer.

46
00:05:12,276 --> 00:05:16,447
My German fellow-countrymen
and women...

47
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,533
...fellow party members.

48
00:05:18,534 --> 00:05:23,225
It is, I think, rather special...

49
00:05:23,746 --> 00:05:30,002
that, after 20 years of service, a man still
stands in front of his supporters...

50
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:39,908
...and that in all those 20 years, his program
never needed to be modified.

51
00:05:55,027 --> 00:05:58,677
I suggest we try it again.

52
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:13,038
I did it.
He hired me.

53
00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:32,328
Berlin - 20 April 1945
Hitler's 56th birthday

54
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,414
two and a half years later

55
00:06:34,935 --> 00:06:35,978
Take cover.

56
00:06:40,618 --> 00:06:44,267
Hurry. Continue.
Get that off the street.

57
00:06:46,641 --> 00:06:47,684
Take cover.

58
00:07:00,808 --> 00:07:01,850
That's artillery fire.

59
00:07:02,372 --> 00:07:06,543
Don't be silly.
Where would it be coming from?

60
00:07:07,064 --> 00:07:09,671
You're right. These are no planes,
this is artillery.

61
00:07:10,713 --> 00:07:15,406
It's the Russians.
What a birthday present.

62
00:07:19,576 --> 00:07:21,662
Where is that cannon fire coming from?

63
00:07:22,183 --> 00:07:24,790
Happy Birthday,
mein Führer.

64
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:27,397
The city centre of Berlin
is under fire.

65
00:07:28,626 --> 00:07:32,276
Grenades have hit near the Brandenburger
Tor and the Reichstag.

66
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:35,217
Where did they come from?
-We don't know yet.

67
00:07:35,738 --> 00:07:38,867
I have Koller on the line.
-Give me Koller.

68
00:07:39,388 --> 00:07:43,559
Koller, do you know Berlin
is under artillery fire?

69
00:07:44,602 --> 00:07:47,208
No.
-Can't you hear the shooting?

70
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:50,858
No, I'm in Wildpark-Werder.
-Berlin is chaotic.

71
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:53,986
Apparently, the Russians captured
a railway bridge over the Oder.

72
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:58,157
The enemy has no railway
artillery near the Oder.

73
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:00,764
It's not long-range artillery.

74
00:08:00,765 --> 00:08:05,977
The anti-aircraft defence near the Zoo-Bunker
reports they're 10 to 12...

75
00:08:05,978 --> 00:08:10,669
... cm calibres. The Russians have
positions near Marzahn.

76
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:15,361
That's only 12 kilometres from the centre.
Are the Russians that close?

77
00:08:15,883 --> 00:08:19,532
They should hang the entire
Luftwaffe leadership.

78
00:08:21,069 --> 00:08:23,676
This is unheard-of.

79
00:08:24,224 --> 00:08:26,831
The Russians are at 12 kilometres
from the city centre.

80
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:30,481
Nobody told me anything.
I had to ask.

81
00:08:31,523 --> 00:08:34,130
Maybe it's long-range artillery,
after all.

82
00:08:34,652 --> 00:08:37,780
That railway bridge over the Oder...
-Nonsense.

83
00:08:44,036 --> 00:08:46,643
That Himmler,
such a pompous buffoon.

84
00:08:47,164 --> 00:08:52,899
Party bosses, everywhere.
They make me so sick.

85
00:08:55,506 --> 00:08:57,591
The Führer starts
'Clausewitz' today.

86
00:08:58,634 --> 00:09:02,283
Berlin as a front city.
He won't be able to keep the city.

87
00:09:02,805 --> 00:09:05,933
If the Führer stays here,
the Reich will go down with him.

88
00:09:06,454 --> 00:09:10,104
We have to talk him out of it.
Talk to Hewel.

89
00:09:10,105 --> 00:09:13,753
He's the only diplomat
with any influence on him.

90
00:09:14,275 --> 00:09:17,403
Hewel tried everything.
It's useless.

91
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:20,531
Talk to your sister-in-law, then.

92
00:09:21,052 --> 00:09:26,266
Why not? You're married
to the sister of Eva Braun.

93
00:09:26,787 --> 00:09:30,437
We must try everything.
Berlin is almost surrounded.

94
00:09:30,438 --> 00:09:33,565
You're still young.
You'll be a father soon.

95
00:09:34,086 --> 00:09:36,693
Do you want to die here?
-Absolutely not.

96
00:09:41,906 --> 00:09:43,992
Gentlemen, the Führer.

97
00:09:54,865 --> 00:09:58,515
Everything out. Quickly.
We're leaving in two hours.

98
00:10:06,692 --> 00:10:09,820
What's going on?
-We're leaving.

99
00:10:11,905 --> 00:10:13,469
'Clausewitz' has started.

100
00:10:13,912 --> 00:10:17,562
All the ministries and departments
are leaving Berlin.

101
00:10:18,161 --> 00:10:21,289
And who's going to look after
the people and the soldiers?

102
00:10:22,332 --> 00:10:25,982
Don't ask me, professor.
-This is insane.

103
00:10:43,747 --> 00:10:45,833
Professor.

104
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,961
I won't allow the
evacuation of my office.

105
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:53,653
Is that so?
-Food supply would collapse.

106
00:10:54,174 --> 00:10:56,781
A good soldier can
always find food.

107
00:10:57,303 --> 00:11:01,995
And when there's fighting all over the city,
where does he get it? The population.

108
00:11:02,881 --> 00:11:06,009
It's irresponsible.
-It's an order from the Führer.

109
00:11:07,574 --> 00:11:10,702
As department head, I
report to the SS and to Himmler.

110
00:11:11,224 --> 00:11:15,395
But as a doctor, I'm part of the Wehrmacht
and they're not leaving yet.

111
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:18,523
Keep that in mind.

112
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:26,864
The professor stays in Berlin.
Get him the proper papers.

113
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,003
We're leaving.

114
00:11:45,588 --> 00:11:48,195
Everything for Germany.
Heil, mein Führer.

115
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:52,366
Führer, I...
Heil, mein Führer.

116
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:56,417
They're in such a hurry
to get away from here.

117
00:11:56,938 --> 00:11:59,024
The brown nosing is the worst.

118
00:11:59,545 --> 00:12:03,194
They say 'Sieg Heil'. but they think
'Lick my... you know what.'

119
00:12:07,286 --> 00:12:11,978
Mein Führer, I beg you: Leave Berlin.
It is not too late yet.

120
00:12:13,021 --> 00:12:14,585
Too late?

121
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:18,235
Hewel, come here for a moment.

122
00:12:18,867 --> 00:12:23,560
I'm sure you agree we should contact
the Allies...

123
00:12:24,081 --> 00:12:29,295
...and start conducting politics.
-Certainly. We need politics.

124
00:12:29,296 --> 00:12:33,465
Politics?
I don't do politics anymore.

125
00:12:33,466 --> 00:12:36,072
I'm fed up with it.

126
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:42,328
When I'm dead, you'll have plenty
of time for politics.

127
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:48,735
It's good, dear Himmler.
My loyal Heinrich.

128
00:12:48,736 --> 00:12:53,684
It's good.
Just go.

129
00:13:14,057 --> 00:13:15,621
He has no strength left.

130
00:13:16,664 --> 00:13:20,313
What did you expect from a
vegetarian teetotaller?

131
00:13:20,835 --> 00:13:24,484
Seriously, though, Fegelein.
I'm taking control now.

132
00:13:25,527 --> 00:13:27,612
Berlin will fall in a couple of days.

133
00:13:28,134 --> 00:13:32,826
When the Führer's dead, who will
the Allies negotiate with?

134
00:13:32,827 --> 00:13:35,954
Why do you think they'll
negotiate with you?

135
00:13:36,475 --> 00:13:39,603
The Nazi state and my SS are needed
to maintain order.

136
00:13:40,646 --> 00:13:42,732
One hour with Eisenhower
and he'll feel the same way.

137
00:13:43,774 --> 00:13:47,945
The first contact has been made.
-Careful, that's high treason.

138
00:13:48,466 --> 00:13:51,073
Fegelein, I have other concerns.

139
00:13:51,074 --> 00:13:56,287
Should I give Eisenhower the Nazi salute
or shake his hand?

140
00:14:02,901 --> 00:14:04,465
Look at that.

141
00:14:07,593 --> 00:14:09,157
The best guests
always arrive late.

142
00:14:09,678 --> 00:14:14,892
Leaving already, gentlemen?
I wanted to talk to you.

143
00:14:15,413 --> 00:14:20,105
The scorched-earth order...
-I really have to go now.

144
00:14:20,106 --> 00:14:23,233
Come and see me one day
in Hohenlychen.

145
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:31,054
I'm going north to help with the
battle of Berlin there.

146
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:45,656
You know, Speer... There's an
advantage to those bombings.

147
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:51,391
It's easier to clean up debris
than to demolish everything ourselves.

148
00:14:52,955 --> 00:14:56,604
When the war will be over,
reconstruction will be quick.

149
00:14:58,168 --> 00:15:03,903
We spent thousands of hours
together with these replicas.

150
00:15:05,467 --> 00:15:08,596
You're a true genius, Speer.

151
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,894
Yes, absolutely. Only you and I know
that the Third Reich would be inconceivable...

152
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:21,108
...with only warehouses and factories.
Skyscrapers and hotels.

153
00:15:22,151 --> 00:15:26,322
This Third Reich will be a treasury
full of art and culture...

154
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:29,971
...that will survive thousands of years.

155
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:34,456
We see, before us, the ancient cities,
the Acropolis...

156
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:37,584
We see the medieval cities...
the cathedrals...

157
00:15:37,585 --> 00:15:42,276
...and we know that the people
need that.

158
00:15:45,404 --> 00:15:48,011
Indeed, Speer.

159
00:15:50,618 --> 00:15:52,703
That was my vision...

160
00:15:54,267 --> 00:15:56,874
...and it still is.

161
00:15:59,481 --> 00:16:04,694
Mein Führer, if you want to realize
these plans, you must leave Berlin.

162
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:13,036
Eva, you say something.

163
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:16,685
He's the Führer.
He knows what's best.

164
00:16:17,207 --> 00:16:21,899
You must leave Berlin.
The Russians almost have us isolated.

165
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,506
I can't do that, my child.

166
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:30,241
I would be like a lama priest
with an empty prayer wheel.

167
00:16:30,242 --> 00:16:36,264
I have to solve the problem,
here in Berlin, or perish.

168
00:16:37,828 --> 00:16:38,871
Speer...

169
00:16:41,478 --> 00:16:43,042
...what do you think?

170
00:16:44,606 --> 00:16:47,734
You have to be on the stage
when the curtain falls.

171
00:17:06,077 --> 00:17:07,119
Reload.

172
00:17:17,695 --> 00:17:19,781
Go away. Leave me alone.

173
00:17:20,302 --> 00:17:23,952
How old are you? Twelve?
And you? Fourteen?

174
00:17:24,473 --> 00:17:27,601
Why are you here?
To play at war? Go home.

175
00:17:28,123 --> 00:17:31,772
Who are you? What do you want?
I want my son. Alive.

176
00:17:32,293 --> 00:17:35,422
You should be proud.
He destroyed two tanks.

177
00:17:35,943 --> 00:17:39,071
The Führer will decorate him
for it, today.

178
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:42,720
You're still young.
At which front did you fight?

179
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:45,327
I haven't had
the honour yet.

180
00:17:45,849 --> 00:17:50,541
Count yourself lucky.
Send the children home.

181
00:17:51,584 --> 00:17:53,669
We'll defend this position
to the last man.

182
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:57,318
Which position?
This is not a position, it's a trap.

183
00:17:58,361 --> 00:18:01,489
The Russians will come from two sides
and you won't be able to get out.

184
00:18:02,011 --> 00:18:04,096
We'll shoot back.
-What with?

185
00:18:05,139 --> 00:18:06,703
With the anti-aircraft guns.

186
00:18:07,224 --> 00:18:10,874
The Russians will arrive with several
armies, tanks and heavy artillery.

187
00:18:11,395 --> 00:18:15,566
Do you really think you'll
last even five minutes?

188
00:18:16,087 --> 00:18:18,694
We promised the Führer.

189
00:18:19,215 --> 00:18:22,343
Don't you understand?
The war is lost.

190
00:18:22,865 --> 00:18:23,907
Coward.

191
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,685
Go away. Right now.

192
00:18:32,249 --> 00:18:36,420
If you're still here when the Russians
arrive, you'll all be dead.

193
00:18:40,069 --> 00:18:45,804
The 9th army had to retreat
or they would have been decimated...

194
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:51,539
We won't retreat the 9th army.
Busse must fight where he stands.

195
00:18:52,061 --> 00:18:54,667
Führer, then the 9th army is lost.

196
00:18:55,189 --> 00:19:00,402
We'll push back the Soviet armies
in the north and east...

197
00:19:00,403 --> 00:19:05,095
...with a ruthless, mighty attack.

198
00:19:06,137 --> 00:19:07,180
Using which units?

199
00:19:08,223 --> 00:19:12,915
Steiner will attack from the north
and join the 9th army.

200
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,607
The 9th army is unable to move.

201
00:19:18,128 --> 00:19:20,214
The enemy outnumbers us ten times.

202
00:19:21,257 --> 00:19:23,863
Wenck's 12th army must
support them.

203
00:19:24,385 --> 00:19:29,598
The 12th army is approaching the Elbe.
-Then it must turn around.

204
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,290
Then the western front would be open.
-Do you doubt my orders?

205
00:19:34,812 --> 00:19:38,461
I think I've been
clear enough.

206
00:19:40,025 --> 00:19:47,324
The Allies will see that only we
can stop the Bolsheviks.

207
00:19:47,846 --> 00:19:52,538
We have to keep Berlin and
make a deal with the Americans.

208
00:20:11,828 --> 00:20:14,956
Mohnke, you're here.
-Mein Führer.

209
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:21,212
Today, 'Clausewitz' started.
Berlin will be a front city.

210
00:20:21,734 --> 00:20:26,426
You will be the commander of the
defensive circle around the citadel.

211
00:20:26,947 --> 00:20:31,118
We'll fight until the last man, in Berlin.

212
00:20:31,639 --> 00:20:35,810
There are still three million civilians here.
They have to be evacuated.

213
00:20:37,374 --> 00:20:43,631
I understand your concern, Mohnke.
But we have to be cold as ice.

214
00:20:44,152 --> 00:20:47,801
We can't spend any energy
on so-called civilians.

215
00:20:49,365 --> 00:20:53,536
With all due respect, what will
happen to the women and children...

216
00:20:54,058 --> 00:20:56,664
...and the thousands of wounded
and elderly?

217
00:20:57,186 --> 00:21:00,835
In a war such as this one,
there are no civilians.

218
00:21:01,878 --> 00:21:03,963
The Führer has lost all
sense of reality.

219
00:21:04,485 --> 00:21:07,613
He's moving divisions around
that no longer exist.

220
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:13,348
Gruppe Steiner has been scattered,
yet Steiner must attack. Madness.

221
00:21:13,869 --> 00:21:17,519
But why don't you tell him that?
-He doesn't listen to reason.

222
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:22,211
Something has to happen.
-Are you crazy? He'll throw us out.

223
00:21:24,818 --> 00:21:28,467
We're soldiers.
We took an oath.

224
00:21:28,468 --> 00:21:31,074
Does that mean we can't use
our own brains anymore?

225
00:21:31,595 --> 00:21:34,723
And that's coming from you?
A ruthless careerist?

226
00:21:35,766 --> 00:21:36,809
I beg your pardon?

227
00:22:02,003 --> 00:22:04,088
Where were you?
-None of your business.

228
00:22:13,027 --> 00:22:17,198
The most successful tank hunters of the
Berlin Hitler-Jugend stand before you.

229
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,582
I'm proud of you.

230
00:22:31,232 --> 00:22:35,403
This boy took out two tanks
using anti-tank shells.

231
00:22:35,924 --> 00:22:40,616
His name is Peter Kranz.
-So you're Peter.

232
00:22:42,702 --> 00:22:46,351
I wish my generals were
as brave as you.

233
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:57,293
Very good.

234
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:05,919
You've made history.

235
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:11,132
And when Germania will rise
from these ruins...

236
00:23:11,654 --> 00:23:13,739
...you will be the heroes.

237
00:23:15,303 --> 00:23:17,388
Heil, to you.

238
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:51,271
I don't know about you,
but I prefer air raids.

239
00:23:52,314 --> 00:23:57,006
What will happen to us?
-I could go if I wanted to.

240
00:23:57,528 --> 00:24:02,220
But everybody is deserting him.
We can't all go, can we?

241
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:04,305
I can't go either.

242
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,647
I wouldn't know
where to go.

243
00:24:13,168 --> 00:24:17,860
My parents and all
my friends warned me.

244
00:24:18,382 --> 00:24:20,989
Don't get involved with the Nazis.

245
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:24,638
What should I say:
'Hello, I made a mistake'?

246
00:24:24,639 --> 00:24:27,245
'When things went wrong,
I admitted my mistake.'

247
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:31,937
Life will go on.

248
00:24:40,394 --> 00:24:43,523
What do you think, Herr Oberst?
-We have to go.

249
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,779
Go where?
-I don't know.

250
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,386
Wherever they need us.

251
00:25:03,855 --> 00:25:06,983
Let's go upstairs.
We'll party.

252
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:08,548
Come on.

253
00:25:12,189 --> 00:25:13,231
Come, children.

254
00:25:20,541 --> 00:25:23,148
We should have fun today.

255
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:34,264
Wherever the enemy goes,
all they find is destruction.

256
00:25:35,307 --> 00:25:37,913
That's the death sentence
for the German people.

257
00:25:39,477 --> 00:25:43,127
No power, no gas, no drinking
water, no coal, no traffic.

258
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:50,947
If you destroy everything, our country
will go back to the Middle Ages.

259
00:25:51,469 --> 00:25:54,597
This order denies the people
any chance of survival.

260
00:25:55,639 --> 00:25:59,810
If the war is lost, what does it matter
that the people are lost too?

261
00:26:00,332 --> 00:26:06,067
The primary necessities of life of the
German people aren't relevant, right now.

262
00:26:06,588 --> 00:26:09,716
On the contrary.
We'd best destroy them ourselves.

263
00:26:10,237 --> 00:26:12,844
Our people turned out weak...

264
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:17,015
...and according to the laws of nature,
they should die out.

265
00:26:17,536 --> 00:26:20,664
They're your people.
You're their Führer.

266
00:26:21,186 --> 00:26:23,793
What remains after this battle...

267
00:26:24,314 --> 00:26:29,006
...is only the inferior.
The superior will have fallen.

268
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:39,670
Come along. You have to dance.

269
00:26:40,191 --> 00:26:43,319
Care to dance, Fräulein Braun?
-I'd love to.

270
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,106
May I?
-Go ahead.

271
00:27:12,148 --> 00:27:13,191
What's wrong?

272
00:27:18,404 --> 00:27:21,533
We have to leave Berlin, Eva.
You must convince him.

273
00:27:25,703 --> 00:27:27,268
Or else, come with me.

274
00:27:36,734 --> 00:27:37,777
You'll die.

275
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:02,148
Can somebody play some music?
I want to dance.

276
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:03,712
Dance.

277
00:28:07,948 --> 00:28:10,033
Do you have a request?
-As long as it swings.

278
00:28:38,487 --> 00:28:40,051
Traudl.

279
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:48,538
It's all so unreal.

280
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:54,795
It's like a dream you
can't get out of.

281
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:56,880
It keeps on going.

282
00:29:01,051 --> 00:29:03,658
Gerda, I don't feel well.

283
00:29:40,127 --> 00:29:41,692
Traudl, come.

284
00:30:01,785 --> 00:30:03,349
I did not move...

285
00:30:05,434 --> 00:30:08,041
I did not move
my command post.

286
00:30:09,446 --> 00:30:11,532
To the west? How so?

287
00:30:12,574 --> 00:30:15,181
I'm at 1000 meters from the enemy.
-General.

288
00:30:35,761 --> 00:30:37,847
And, general?

289
00:30:37,848 --> 00:30:40,975
I'll be executed.
-What? Why?

290
00:30:42,017 --> 00:30:46,188
They think I moved my
command post to the west.

291
00:30:47,231 --> 00:30:49,838
Be sensible, general.
-Come along.

292
00:31:07,496 --> 00:31:09,060
Schenck.
-Mohnke.

293
00:31:09,551 --> 00:31:14,243
I'm under the chancellery.
I'm commander of the citadel now.

294
00:31:14,765 --> 00:31:18,936
I need help.
-That will be difficult. Everything's gone.

295
00:31:19,457 --> 00:31:21,542
My assistant and I are
the only ones here.

296
00:31:22,453 --> 00:31:24,538
You're a doctor, aren't you?
-Yes, an internist.

297
00:31:25,059 --> 00:31:29,230
Commandeer a car and
bring all the medication...

298
00:31:29,752 --> 00:31:32,358
...you can find, to me.

299
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,008
I'll do my best.
-Thanks. Hurry.

300
00:32:26,258 --> 00:32:28,344
I need to talk to the Führer.

301
00:32:29,386 --> 00:32:33,036
What about?
-I'm going to be executed.

302
00:32:36,685 --> 00:32:37,728
Wait here.

303
00:32:39,292 --> 00:32:40,335
Your weapon, please.

304
00:32:47,496 --> 00:32:48,676
Not here.

305
00:32:52,256 --> 00:32:55,906
Guard post 2.
Understood.

306
00:32:57,991 --> 00:32:59,555
General...

307
00:33:02,162 --> 00:33:03,726
Not you.

308
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:29,807
What's going on here?
Why am I going to be executed?

309
00:33:30,328 --> 00:33:34,499
You know that any evasive manoeuvre
towards the west is forbidden.

310
00:33:35,021 --> 00:33:39,713
Officers who don't obey,
must be executed.

311
00:33:39,714 --> 00:33:43,362
What do you mean?
My troops have been fighting for days.

312
00:33:44,405 --> 00:33:48,576
My command post
is a kilometre away from the front line.

313
00:33:49,097 --> 00:33:50,661
Continue.

314
00:33:50,662 --> 00:33:55,354
Do you see this? I don't want you
to use that tone with me.

315
00:33:56,918 --> 00:34:00,046
And now, do whatever
you feel you must.

316
00:34:00,567 --> 00:34:04,738
It's best if you tell this to the
Führer yourself. Come along.

317
00:34:20,098 --> 00:34:24,269
You can't pass, Oberst.
-Orders from brigade führer Mohnke:

318
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:27,397
I have to get into the hospital.
We need medication.

319
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:30,525
There's nobody left.
They all took off.

320
00:34:31,047 --> 00:34:33,653
And the wounded?
-How should I know?

321
00:34:34,175 --> 00:34:36,260
I'm going to have a look.
You stay here.

322
00:34:36,455 --> 00:34:40,626
Be very careful.
There are lots of Russians here.

323
00:34:41,457 --> 00:34:46,149
See that? That's where the
Reich ends. Behind it, is Russkie land.

324
00:34:57,996 --> 00:34:59,560
May I?

325
00:34:59,561 --> 00:35:10,491
He's damned stubborn.
Why doesn't he let me do that?

326
00:36:11,786 --> 00:36:15,435
I should have been back by now.
Are you sure the Führer still needs me?

327
00:36:15,957 --> 00:36:19,085
Drink.
-Führer's orders.

328
00:36:19,606 --> 00:36:22,712
You made a big impression
on the Führer.

329
00:36:23,234 --> 00:36:25,319
But you don't think Steiner
will attack, do you?

330
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,447
I doubt whether Steiner
is able to do anything...

331
00:36:28,969 --> 00:36:31,575
...but you probably know that
better than I do.

332
00:36:32,618 --> 00:36:35,746
If Steiner doesn't attack,
Berlin is lost.

333
00:36:45,429 --> 00:36:47,514
The Führer was impressed
with your report.

334
00:36:48,036 --> 00:36:52,206
He puts you in command of
the defence of Berlin.

335
00:36:53,249 --> 00:36:57,941
I'd have preferred it
if he executed me.

336
00:37:18,884 --> 00:37:20,970
Let them get closer.

337
00:37:22,386 --> 00:37:23,950
Tank alert.

338
00:37:23,951 --> 00:37:28,841
Take it easy. Wait, kid.
They're still too far.

339
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:22,300
Is it German artillery that I hear?
-I'm afraid not.

340
00:38:22,821 --> 00:38:24,906
But hasn't Steiner's
attack started?

341
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:31,163
You have to go as fast as you can.
Time is running out.

342
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:33,769
But the Führer has
the situation under control.

343
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,376
Steiner will make
all the difference.

344
00:38:37,419 --> 00:38:40,547
He says it will change
military history.

345
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:44,718
Everybody, but the Führer, knows
that's a fantasy.

346
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:50,453
I even wonder if he believes it himself.
-Why would he be playing games?

347
00:38:50,974 --> 00:38:52,538
What does he have to lose?

348
00:38:54,102 --> 00:38:55,145
I don't believe a word of it.

349
00:38:56,188 --> 00:38:58,794
The enemy made a breakthrough.

350
00:38:59,316 --> 00:39:02,965
They took Zossen and are advancing
towards Stahnsdorf.

351
00:39:03,487 --> 00:39:07,136
They're at the northern city border,
between Frohnau and Pankow.

352
00:39:07,657 --> 00:39:12,871
In the east, they reached
Lichtenberg, Mahlsdorf and Karlshorst.

353
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:16,521
If Steiner attacks,
everything will be alright.

354
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:21,734
Mein Führer...

355
00:39:23,298 --> 00:39:24,862
Steiner...

356
00:39:26,426 --> 00:39:29,033
Steiner didn't have enough force.

357
00:39:29,554 --> 00:39:32,161
The attack didn't take place.

358
00:39:48,462 --> 00:39:54,197
The following stay here:
Keitel, Jodl, Krebs and Burgdorf.

359
00:40:08,827 --> 00:40:14,041
That was an order.
Steiner's attack was an order.

360
00:40:14,562 --> 00:40:18,733
How dare you
ignore my orders?

361
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:23,425
Is this what it came to?

362
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:30,203
The military, everybody lied
to me. Even the SS.

363
00:40:30,724 --> 00:40:35,937
The generals are no more than
a bunch of disloyal cowards.

364
00:40:36,459 --> 00:40:38,544
I don't allow that...

365
00:40:39,066 --> 00:40:43,758
Cowards, traitors and incompetents.
-Führer, this is outrageous.

366
00:40:44,279 --> 00:40:47,929
The generals are the scum
of the German people.

367
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:51,057
No sense of honour.

368
00:40:51,578 --> 00:40:55,749
You call yourself general because
you spent years at the academy...

369
00:40:56,792 --> 00:40:59,398
...where you only learnt
to use knife and fork.

370
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,091
For years, the military
obstructed me.

371
00:41:04,612 --> 00:41:08,783
All you ever did is
thwart me.

372
00:41:09,548 --> 00:41:12,676
I should have had...

373
00:41:13,198 --> 00:41:17,890
...all the high officers executed.
Like Stalin did.

374
00:41:22,621 --> 00:41:25,227
I never went to the academy.

375
00:41:25,228 --> 00:41:32,005
But I conquered all
of Europe on my own.

376
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,364
Traitors.

377
00:41:38,886 --> 00:41:43,578
I've been betrayed and deceived
from the start.

378
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:48,792
Such enormous betrayal
of the German people.

379
00:41:49,834 --> 00:41:55,048
But all these traitors will pay.
With their own blood.

380
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:58,100
They will drown
in their own blood.

381
00:42:00,707 --> 00:42:02,271
Calm, Gerda.

382
00:42:09,828 --> 00:42:13,478
All my orders have
been ignored.

383
00:42:15,042 --> 00:42:19,213
How can I be a leader
under these circumstances?

384
00:42:20,988 --> 00:42:23,074
It's over.

385
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:30,138
The war is lost.

386
00:42:36,161 --> 00:42:39,810
But if you think this means
I'll leave Berlin...

387
00:42:40,332 --> 00:42:44,502
...you're wrong. I'd rather
shoot a bullet through my head.

388
00:42:49,347 --> 00:42:51,432
Do what you want.

389
00:43:12,272 --> 00:43:15,921
The Führer wasn't serious about
killing himself, was he?

390
00:43:16,443 --> 00:43:19,050
Frau Junge, Frau Christian.

391
00:43:22,699 --> 00:43:27,391
Get changed. In one hour,
a plane will take you south.

392
00:43:28,886 --> 00:43:30,972
Everything is lost.

393
00:43:31,493 --> 00:43:33,579
Completely lost.

394
00:43:37,228 --> 00:43:40,878
You know I'll stay with you.
You can't send me away.

395
00:43:53,198 --> 00:43:55,284
I'm staying too, mein Führer.

396
00:44:19,832 --> 00:44:20,875
Now what?

397
00:44:21,918 --> 00:44:23,482
Time to end this charade.

398
00:44:24,524 --> 00:44:28,695
Do you want us to stop fighting?
That's inconceivable.

399
00:44:29,217 --> 00:44:34,430
The Führer doesn't want us to capitulate.
No more November 1918. Ever.

400
00:44:34,951 --> 00:44:38,601
But he doesn't want to be in charge
anymore. He said: 'Do what you want'.

401
00:44:39,122 --> 00:44:42,250
Nobody can replace him.
He's the Führer.

402
00:44:42,772 --> 00:44:44,857
The Führer's confused.
He'll recover.

403
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,507
Great.
And then what?

404
00:44:51,113 --> 00:44:54,242
No capitulation. That was
never his intention.

405
00:44:55,284 --> 00:44:57,891
We owe it to him.
-Hollow phrases.

406
00:44:58,412 --> 00:45:00,498
We have to act now.
Or it will be too late.

407
00:45:01,541 --> 00:45:04,147
You're only looking after yourself.
-Mind your words.

408
00:45:13,363 --> 00:45:14,927
Damn.

409
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:23,790
We'll never get out of here alive.
It's all over.

410
00:45:24,311 --> 00:45:25,354
We've got to wait.

411
00:45:25,875 --> 00:45:29,525
Even the Führer doesn't believe in it
anymore. What will happen to us?

412
00:45:30,046 --> 00:45:34,217
Günsche says there's a tunnel
that goes under the Russian lines.

413
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:37,866
Why did you say
you wanted to stay with him?

414
00:45:38,388 --> 00:45:42,037
I don't know.
Honestly.

415
00:45:44,644 --> 00:45:47,251
It stopped.
Let's go for a walk.

416
00:46:29,033 --> 00:46:30,597
Traudl.

417
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:32,683
Look here.

418
00:46:55,087 --> 00:46:57,694
I'm lighting another one.

419
00:47:15,626 --> 00:47:18,232
Let's go down again.

420
00:47:48,245 --> 00:47:52,416
Where do they come from?
-Volkssturm. Drafted this afternoon.

421
00:47:52,937 --> 00:47:55,544
They have to get
out of the field of fire.

422
00:47:59,193 --> 00:48:03,364
The Volkssturm is under the
direct command of Dr. Goebbels.

423
00:48:06,532 --> 00:48:10,181
I want them to go away from there.
This is insane.

424
00:48:11,224 --> 00:48:12,788
I'll take the responsibility.

425
00:48:23,945 --> 00:48:27,595
I think this is wrong.
-Great.

426
00:48:29,159 --> 00:48:30,723
Stop. Lights out.

427
00:48:31,244 --> 00:48:33,851
Stop. Stay where you are.

428
00:48:34,372 --> 00:48:37,500
Stay where you are.
-Alright, Germans.

429
00:48:41,529 --> 00:48:45,700
Help. They want to kill us.
-What is all this?

430
00:48:45,701 --> 00:48:49,871
A Greifkommando.
-You're kidding.

431
00:48:59,768 --> 00:49:02,896
Stop it.
Let those men go.

432
00:49:03,418 --> 00:49:06,546
What's this?
You have no authority here.

433
00:49:07,067 --> 00:49:11,760
These men are on the run.
Traitors will be killed.

434
00:49:12,281 --> 00:49:15,930
They're old men. Civilians.
You can't do this.

435
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:23,387
Who's going to stop me?
You maybe?

436
00:49:25,472 --> 00:49:27,558
Stop it. That's enough.

437
00:49:41,483 --> 00:49:43,047
Dismissed.

438
00:51:26,767 --> 00:51:28,853
This man's a doctor.

439
00:51:36,137 --> 00:51:38,744
Can you operate?
-Not really.

440
00:51:41,828 --> 00:51:45,999
Don't let the children
take too many toys.

441
00:51:46,521 --> 00:51:49,649
And not too much nightwear.
That's no longer needed.

442
00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:53,298
Herr Minister...
-Frau Junge, my family will arrive soon.

443
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:57,990
Can you look after them for a moment?
Thank you.

444
00:51:58,512 --> 00:52:00,076
Brigade führer, what can I do for you?

445
00:52:00,597 --> 00:52:03,725
Your Volkssturm is an easy prey
for the Russians.

446
00:52:04,247 --> 00:52:06,853
They have neither combat experience
nor good weapons.

447
00:52:07,375 --> 00:52:12,588
Their unconditional belief
in the final victory makes up for that.

448
00:52:12,589 --> 00:52:17,280
Herr Minister, without weapons
these men can't fight.

449
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:19,366
Their deaths will be pointless.

450
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:22,494
I don't pity them.

451
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:26,665
I repeat:
I don't pity them.

452
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:29,793
The people called this
upon themselves.

453
00:52:30,836 --> 00:52:34,485
This may come as a surprise to you.
Don't fool yourself.

454
00:52:35,007 --> 00:52:38,656
We didn't force the people.
They gave us a mandate.

455
00:52:38,657 --> 00:52:42,305
And now they're paying for it.

456
00:52:59,363 --> 00:53:01,970
Eva, you have to leave the Führer.

457
00:53:02,491 --> 00:53:04,577
Don't be stupid.
This is about life and death.

458
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:07,183
How can you say that?
Where are you?

459
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:10,833
I decided
not to die in Berlin.

460
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:16,047
Does my sister know where you are?
-Think about it. I'll call you back.

461
00:53:18,132 --> 00:53:20,739
Children, your room is to the right.

462
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:24,388
Wait for me.

463
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:29,602
Hello, Frau Goebbels.
-Good to see you, Frau Junge.

464
00:53:42,012 --> 00:53:44,097
Line up, children.

465
00:53:44,619 --> 00:53:46,704
Helga, come. Line up.

466
00:53:47,747 --> 00:53:52,439
Let's make ourselves look good and
then we go say hello to uncle Hitler.

467
00:53:56,610 --> 00:53:58,695
Do you remember the song?

468
00:54:38,339 --> 00:54:42,510
The best thing to do is to
shoot yourself in the mouth.

469
00:54:46,681 --> 00:54:49,809
You won't feel a thing.
You'll be dead right away.

470
00:54:50,852 --> 00:54:53,459
I want to be a beautiful corpse.
I'll take poison.

471
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:57,108
If I have to die,
at least without any pain.

472
00:54:57,629 --> 00:54:59,193
That's definitely painless.

473
00:54:59,715 --> 00:55:04,407
It paralyses the nervous system
and the respiratory system.

474
00:55:04,928 --> 00:55:06,492
A matter of seconds.

475
00:55:08,578 --> 00:55:11,706
Can I have one too?
-Me too.

476
00:55:16,919 --> 00:55:21,612
Himmler provided me well.

477
00:55:39,458 --> 00:55:41,543
Thank you.

478
00:55:42,586 --> 00:55:47,278
I would have liked to give you
a nicer present.

479
00:55:55,174 --> 00:55:59,345
Berlin, 23 April 1945.

480
00:56:02,995 --> 00:56:08,208
Dear sister. I'm sorry
to write you this.

481
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:13,422
But this is how it is. It could
be over any moment.

482
00:56:13,943 --> 00:56:17,071
First of all: Hermann isn't with us.

483
00:56:17,593 --> 00:56:21,242
But I'm sure
you'll see him again.

484
00:56:21,763 --> 00:56:26,977
He'll get through this
and he'll fight from Bavaria.

485
00:56:27,498 --> 00:56:31,148
The Führer lost all hope
of a good outcome.

486
00:56:32,712 --> 00:56:36,361
Dear son. I don't know
if you'll receive this letter.

487
00:56:37,404 --> 00:56:42,096
Maybe someone will allow me
to send you a last greeting.

488
00:56:42,618 --> 00:56:46,267
I stayed with daddy
against his will.

489
00:56:46,788 --> 00:56:49,917
Last Sunday, the Führer
wanted to help me escape.

490
00:56:50,438 --> 00:56:53,045
But you know your mother.
We have the same blood.

491
00:56:53,566 --> 00:56:57,216
I won't even think about it.
Our ideology's going down the drain...

492
00:56:57,737 --> 00:57:02,950
...and with it, everything that made life
beautiful and worthwhile.

493
00:57:03,472 --> 00:57:07,643
After the Führer and National Socialism,
there's nothing left to live for.

494
00:57:08,685 --> 00:57:11,292
That's why I brought
the children too.

495
00:57:11,814 --> 00:57:13,899
They're too good for the life
that awaits them.

496
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:19,112
God will have mercy on me
if I bring them redemption myself.

497
00:57:26,938 --> 00:57:31,109
I'll wear my bracelet with the green
stone until the very end.

498
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:36,844
After that, I want
you to always wear it.

499
00:57:38,408 --> 00:57:42,057
Unfortunately, my diamond watch
is with the watchmaker.

500
00:57:42,579 --> 00:57:46,749
I included the address below.
I hope you're lucky enough to get it.

501
00:57:47,792 --> 00:57:49,356
I want you to get it.

502
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:54,570
You'll also get the bracelet
with the topaz pendant.

503
00:57:55,091 --> 00:57:57,698
A birthday present
from the Führer.

504
00:57:59,262 --> 00:58:02,911
I owe some money
to the Heise company.

505
00:58:03,954 --> 00:58:08,842
There may be more debts, but
no more than 1500 Reichsmarks.

506
00:58:10,406 --> 00:58:16,663
All correspondence with
the Führer must be burnt.

507
00:58:18,748 --> 00:58:25,004
I'm sending you some food and tobacco.
The coffee is also for Lindner and Kathl.

508
00:58:25,526 --> 00:58:31,261
The cigarettes are for Mandi, the tobacco
for daddy, the chocolate for mummy.

509
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,692
I can't think of anything else.
That's it for today.

510
00:58:37,704 --> 00:58:41,353
Dear sister, I wish
you lots of happiness.

511
00:58:41,787 --> 00:58:45,436
And remember,
you will see Hermann again.

512
00:58:45,958 --> 00:58:49,607
The warmest regards
and a kiss from...

513
00:58:50,129 --> 00:58:51,693
...your sister.

514
00:59:43,361 --> 00:59:45,446
Inge.

515
01:00:35,009 --> 01:00:40,223
Listen, Keitel.
I want you to leave this evening.

516
01:00:40,744 --> 01:00:44,394
Go to Dönitz and help him
with the organisation.

517
01:00:44,915 --> 01:00:48,043
Things have to be
started up again.

518
01:00:49,607 --> 01:00:51,693
I don't understand you.

519
01:00:52,214 --> 01:00:55,864
We have no more oil fields.
That's catastrophic.

520
01:00:56,363 --> 01:01:02,098
It makes any serious operation
impossible.

521
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:08,897
When everything has been solved
here, we must get the oil fields back.

522
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:16,718
Any questions?
-No, mein Führer.

523
01:01:17,239 --> 01:01:19,846
Good.
Have a good trip.

524
01:02:46,392 --> 01:02:49,520
Min Fører, efter som du har besluttet
at blive i Berlin...

525
01:02:53,005 --> 01:02:56,654
...do you agree that I take charge...

526
01:02:57,176 --> 01:03:00,304
...with complete freedom of action?

527
01:03:00,825 --> 01:03:02,910
If I receive no reply
by 2200 hours...

528
01:03:03,432 --> 01:03:06,462
...I'll assume you have
been incapacitated.

529
01:03:06,983 --> 01:03:10,633
I will then act on behalf
of the country and the motherland.

530
01:03:11,675 --> 01:03:14,282
That's high treason.
And betrayal of you.

531
01:03:14,804 --> 01:03:17,410
Göring's concerns are not
entirely unjustified.

532
01:03:17,932 --> 01:03:21,060
If our communication
system fails...

533
01:03:21,581 --> 01:03:24,709
...we'll be cut off
from the outside world.

534
01:03:25,231 --> 01:03:27,316
We won't be able
to issue orders anymore.

535
01:03:27,837 --> 01:03:30,444
I think Göring wants to
seize the power.

536
01:03:31,487 --> 01:03:34,094
I never trusted his clique
on the Obersalzberg.

537
01:03:35,136 --> 01:03:36,700
This looks like a coup.

538
01:03:37,222 --> 01:03:40,871
The loser, the sponger.

539
01:03:41,393 --> 01:03:43,999
A parvenu, a lazy bastard.

540
01:03:45,140 --> 01:03:49,832
How dare he say
I'm incapacitated?

541
01:03:50,875 --> 01:03:54,003
Hello.
-How did you get into Berlin?

542
01:03:54,525 --> 01:03:57,131
It wasn't easy,
but I must speak to the Führer.

543
01:03:58,174 --> 01:04:00,259
If I were you,
I'd wait a bit.

544
01:04:00,781 --> 01:04:03,909
The Luftwaffe.
What did he turn that into?

545
01:04:04,430 --> 01:04:07,558
For that alone,
he should be executed.

546
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:13,815
This morphine addict
corrupted the country.

547
01:04:14,857 --> 01:04:16,421
And now this.

548
01:04:17,464 --> 01:04:20,071
He's betraying me.

549
01:04:21,635 --> 01:04:24,763
Me of all people.

550
01:04:24,764 --> 01:04:35,190
I want Göring stripped
of his power, right away.

551
01:04:36,233 --> 01:04:38,840
And, in case I don't
survive the war...

552
01:04:39,361 --> 01:04:42,489
...he must be
executed immediately.

553
01:04:45,096 --> 01:04:49,267
What's going to happen to us?
Is there any hope left?

554
01:04:51,874 --> 01:04:55,002
Frau Junge, leave from
here before it's too late.

555
01:04:55,523 --> 01:04:59,694
The Führer wants to stay.
We can't leave him behind, can we?

556
01:04:59,695 --> 01:05:05,429
He doesn't need anybody for what
awaits him. And least of all you.

557
01:05:06,472 --> 01:05:10,642
But Herr Goebbels and his wife
stay here. And the children.

558
01:05:20,027 --> 01:05:22,112
But the children...

559
01:05:25,762 --> 01:05:27,847
I have always believed...

560
01:05:29,411 --> 01:05:32,539
...that there was a way out.

561
01:05:39,317 --> 01:05:41,402
Come in.

562
01:05:43,488 --> 01:05:45,573
Albert. Hello.

563
01:05:57,043 --> 01:05:59,128
You have a fever.

564
01:05:59,650 --> 01:06:02,778
Albert, I can't stand
it anymore.

565
01:06:04,863 --> 01:06:07,470
Why don't you leave with
the children, Magda?

566
01:06:07,991 --> 01:06:10,598
Leave?
And go where?

567
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:15,812
I can arrange for you to be
taken to Schwanenwerder by barge.

568
01:06:16,333 --> 01:06:19,983
You can hide
until everything's over.

569
01:06:20,504 --> 01:06:22,589
It won't be long now anyway.

570
01:06:23,111 --> 01:06:25,196
I thought about it.

571
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:31,974
My children cannot grow up
in a world without National Socialism.

572
01:06:35,102 --> 01:06:39,794
Think about it. The children
have a right to a future.

573
01:06:43,965 --> 01:06:48,657
If National Socialism dies,
there will be no future.

574
01:07:05,102 --> 01:07:07,708
I can't believe
you really want that.

575
01:07:09,794 --> 01:07:12,401
Go now.

576
01:07:43,302 --> 01:07:45,388
Come in.

577
01:07:49,559 --> 01:07:51,644
I knew you'd come.

578
01:07:52,165 --> 01:07:55,293
You wouldn't desert
the Führer.

579
01:07:59,330 --> 01:08:05,065
I've come to say goodbye to the Führer.
I'm going back to Hamburg tonight.

580
01:08:05,586 --> 01:08:08,193
Of course, you must go.
Sit down.

581
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:13,928
I took some furniture
you designed.

582
01:08:13,928 --> 01:08:16,483
I couldn't leave it behind.

583
01:08:17,005 --> 01:08:21,176
Please, you must
not have eaten all day.

584
01:08:22,218 --> 01:08:23,782
That's true.

585
01:08:28,475 --> 01:08:33,688
It's very important that you came.
It shows him you're on his side.

586
01:08:34,209 --> 01:08:36,295
Did he ever doubt that?

587
01:08:37,859 --> 01:08:41,508
Lately, he often thought
you were against him too.

588
01:08:42,030 --> 01:08:45,679
I always said you'd come
and here you are.

589
01:08:50,371 --> 01:08:54,021
I think he liked it that you
advised him to stay in Berlin.

590
01:08:54,542 --> 01:08:56,628
I also think it's best.

591
01:08:59,756 --> 01:09:01,841
And, you know...

592
01:09:02,884 --> 01:09:04,969
...it may sound strange...

593
01:09:07,055 --> 01:09:12,268
...but I'm really happy here.
And I'm not afraid.

594
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:43,752
You came.
-Mein Führer, I...

595
01:09:43,753 --> 01:09:45,837
It's good.

596
01:09:47,401 --> 01:09:48,965
Let's sit down.

597
01:10:06,902 --> 01:10:12,116
I had great plans
for the Germans and the world.

598
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:18,893
Nobody understood me.
Not even my old brothers in arms.

599
01:10:23,064 --> 01:10:29,320
The opportunities we had.
The whole world was ours to grab.

600
01:10:32,312 --> 01:10:33,876
Too late.

601
01:10:40,132 --> 01:10:45,346
I can only be proud for openly
fighting the Jews...

602
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:51,081
...and for cleansing the Lebensraum
from the Jewish poison.

603
01:10:55,773 --> 01:10:59,944
I don't find it hard to continue.
One brief moment...

604
01:10:59,945 --> 01:11:10,371
...and then eternal peace.

605
01:11:14,542 --> 01:11:17,670
But please spare the people,
mein Führer.

606
01:11:17,671 --> 01:11:23,405
If my people cannot endure
this ordeal...

607
01:11:23,406 --> 01:11:26,533
...I won't shed a tear.

608
01:11:27,054 --> 01:11:29,140
They get what they deserve.

609
01:11:29,661 --> 01:11:35,396
They called this fate
upon themselves.

610
01:11:40,609 --> 01:11:42,695
For months...

611
01:11:44,259 --> 01:11:46,344
...I have to tell you this...

612
01:11:47,908 --> 01:11:51,558
...for months I have sabotaged
your orders for destruction.

613
01:11:53,643 --> 01:12:00,421
I not only ignored your orders,
but even acted against them.

614
01:12:05,632 --> 01:12:07,196
I had to tell you.

615
01:12:16,491 --> 01:12:20,662
This never compromised
my personal loyalty to you.

616
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:36,527
So you're leaving.

617
01:12:37,773 --> 01:12:39,337
Good.

618
01:12:39,858 --> 01:12:41,422
Goodbye.

619
01:12:53,030 --> 01:12:55,115
I wish you all the best.

620
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:20,770
Eat well, gentlemen.

621
01:14:16,517 --> 01:14:18,081
Peter.

622
01:14:27,147 --> 01:14:29,754
It's alright, son.

623
01:14:46,575 --> 01:14:48,139
He has a fever.

624
01:14:50,294 --> 01:14:51,337
Yes, but he's alive.

625
01:15:16,205 --> 01:15:20,376
Loyalty and courage
still exist in this world.

626
01:15:20,897 --> 01:15:24,026
Ritter von Greim
and Fräulein Reitsch, how good...

627
01:15:27,154 --> 01:15:31,324
...that the both of you arrived
more or less unharmed.

628
01:15:32,367 --> 01:15:33,410
Sit down.

629
01:15:34,974 --> 01:15:38,102
We came under heavy fire, but
still arrived in Gatow.

630
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:41,230
From there,
we couldn't continue.

631
01:15:42,273 --> 01:15:46,444
We flew in a Fieseler Storch,
over the Russian lines...

632
01:15:47,486 --> 01:15:50,093
...and landed on the
East-West axis, close to here.

633
01:15:50,615 --> 01:15:53,221
Before landing, the Soviets
had a go at us.

634
01:15:54,885 --> 01:15:59,577
General Von Greim, I appoint you
supreme commander of the Luftwaffe.

635
01:16:00,619 --> 01:16:03,226
I hereby promote you
to General-Feldmarschall.

636
01:16:04,329 --> 01:16:06,936
A big responsibility
rests on your shoulders.

637
01:16:07,457 --> 01:16:10,586
You have to rebuild the
Luftwaffe from scratch.

638
01:16:11,107 --> 01:16:13,714
Many mistakes have been made.
Be ruthless.

639
01:16:15,278 --> 01:16:18,406
Life doesn't forgive weakness.

640
01:16:20,491 --> 01:16:26,226
This so-called humanity
is religious drivel.

641
01:16:27,790 --> 01:16:33,004
Compassion is an eternal sin.
To feel compassion for the weak...

642
01:16:33,525 --> 01:16:35,089
...is a betrayal of nature.

643
01:16:36,132 --> 01:16:41,346
The strong can only triumph
if the weak are exterminated.

644
01:16:41,867 --> 01:16:45,634
Being loyal to this law,
I've never had compassion.

645
01:16:49,646 --> 01:16:53,816
I've always been ruthless
when faced with internal...

646
01:16:54,338 --> 01:16:58,509
...opposition from other races.
And that's the only way.

647
01:17:00,594 --> 01:17:02,679
Apes, for instance...

648
01:17:03,675 --> 01:17:08,367
...kill all the odd ones.

649
01:17:08,889 --> 01:17:14,624
And what applies to apes,
must definitely apply to humans.

650
01:17:20,896 --> 01:17:22,981
Himmler made an offer to surrender...

651
01:17:22,982 --> 01:17:28,716
...to the allied powers.

652
01:17:29,237 --> 01:17:30,801
Via Count Bernadotte.

653
01:17:32,887 --> 01:17:35,493
A message from the English radio.

654
01:17:40,186 --> 01:17:45,399
Himmler.
Himmler of all people.

655
01:17:46,442 --> 01:17:53,741
The most loyal of my loyals.
That's the worst betrayal.

656
01:17:58,089 --> 01:18:01,739
Göring, he was corrupt.
Always has been.

657
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:08,516
Speer, an absent-minded artist.
All the others: yes.

658
01:18:09,038 --> 01:18:15,294
But Himmler?
Has he gone insane?

659
01:18:15,815 --> 01:18:19,986
He must have told
them I'm sick.

660
01:18:20,507 --> 01:18:22,593
Maybe even dead.

661
01:18:28,849 --> 01:18:33,541
Leave me alone with Ritter Von Greim
and Fräulein Reitsch.

662
01:18:35,105 --> 01:18:39,797
And get Fegelein.
-We don't know where he is.

663
01:18:40,319 --> 01:18:43,968
What? He's Himmler's assistant.
He must be available.

664
01:18:43,969 --> 01:18:48,661
We haven't seen him for days.
-I want a report immediately.

665
01:18:51,789 --> 01:18:53,353
Please stay here, Doctor.

666
01:18:58,566 --> 01:19:02,737
You and Greim must go as quickly
as possible. Fly to Dönitz.

667
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:08,993
Tell him to do anything
it takes to punish Himmler.

668
01:19:09,515 --> 01:19:13,686
We've decided to
die with you.

669
01:19:16,292 --> 01:19:18,899
Thank you for this proof of loyalty.

670
01:19:20,463 --> 01:19:24,113
But Himmler must die.
He committed treason.

671
01:19:24,114 --> 01:19:28,806
He's no longer privvy
to my plans.

672
01:19:29,327 --> 01:19:30,370
Mein Führer?

673
01:19:30,891 --> 01:19:34,541
Do you think I'll sit and wait until
those Jewish swine slaughter me?

674
01:19:35,062 --> 01:19:39,233
This is part of a huge decoy operation.
I've allowed the enemy...

675
01:19:39,234 --> 01:19:44,446
...to invade the Reich and they
think they've won.

676
01:19:44,968 --> 01:19:48,617
But mark my words: they have
another thing coming.

677
01:19:48,618 --> 01:19:52,788
Dönitz is mobilising in the north.
Kesselring in the south.

678
01:19:53,310 --> 01:19:57,480
We'll surround the enemy
and crush them.

679
01:19:58,002 --> 01:20:03,215
From Prague, three armies will attack
the Russians, simultaneously, from the back.

680
01:20:03,737 --> 01:20:08,950
I didn't know we still had
so many reserve troops.

681
01:20:09,993 --> 01:20:13,642
I made sure you'll soon have
a 1000 of the most modern...

682
01:20:13,643 --> 01:20:17,813
...jets at your disposal.

683
01:20:18,335 --> 01:20:22,505
With those, you can make the
Luftwaffe ready for battle again.

684
01:20:23,027 --> 01:20:27,719
I kneel to your genius, at the
altar of the motherland.

685
01:20:42,629 --> 01:20:44,193
Heil, mein Führer.

686
01:20:47,321 --> 01:20:50,449
You also request to leave Berlin?

687
01:20:52,013 --> 01:20:56,184
Mein Führer, as you know,
all medical departments...

688
01:20:56,705 --> 01:20:59,833
...that fall under the SS and Himmler,
have left Berlin.

689
01:21:00,876 --> 01:21:05,047
Himmler is a traitor.
He won't escape punishment.

690
01:21:05,568 --> 01:21:10,414
Mein Führer, as Reichsarzt SS,
I have no more work here.

691
01:21:11,456 --> 01:21:15,106
Your request to leave Berlin
is unacceptable.

692
01:21:16,670 --> 01:21:18,755
My family...

693
01:21:20,319 --> 01:21:23,448
If the Russians...
I must leave.

694
01:21:23,969 --> 01:21:25,533
You did nothing wrong.

695
01:21:26,576 --> 01:21:31,789
Future generations will thank you
for you medical research.

696
01:21:32,311 --> 01:21:34,396
I take all the responsibility.

697
01:21:40,652 --> 01:21:43,259
We'll talk about it later.

698
01:21:57,620 --> 01:22:01,791
Gruppenführer Fegelein cannot
be found. He's not in the bunker.

699
01:22:02,312 --> 01:22:04,919
What, you can't find Fegelein?

700
01:22:05,962 --> 01:22:10,133
Keep searching.
I need to talk to him. Immediately.

701
01:22:11,176 --> 01:22:15,346
If he left just like that,
that's desertion. Treason.

702
01:22:15,868 --> 01:22:17,432
Bring me Fegelein.

703
01:22:17,953 --> 01:22:20,560
Fegelein. Fegelein.

704
01:22:32,070 --> 01:22:35,199
Daddy, why are you wearing
your Sunday uniform?

705
01:22:38,327 --> 01:22:43,019
Ernst, is something wrong?
-No.

706
01:22:43,540 --> 01:22:45,104
Thank you.

707
01:22:45,626 --> 01:22:47,190
Brigitte is hungry too.

708
01:22:49,275 --> 01:22:52,925
Ilse, you should
eat something as well.

709
01:22:55,010 --> 01:22:57,095
Thank you.
-There you go.

710
01:23:01,788 --> 01:23:03,352
Thank you.

711
01:23:57,448 --> 01:24:01,098
What is it?
-Gruppenführer, you're under arrest.

712
01:24:02,141 --> 01:24:03,705
What?
-You're suspected of desertion.

713
01:24:04,226 --> 01:24:06,311
Get dressed.
You'll come with us.

714
01:24:11,525 --> 01:24:13,089
Search the room.

715
01:24:13,610 --> 01:24:16,739
Let go of me.
You can't give me orders.

716
01:24:18,824 --> 01:24:21,952
You can't have Hermann
executed, can you?

717
01:24:22,473 --> 01:24:25,602
There's no doubt.
He wanted to flee.

718
01:24:25,603 --> 01:24:29,251
What does it matter?
Everything's over.

719
01:24:30,294 --> 01:24:32,901
Think of my poor sister.
She's pregnant by Hermann.

720
01:24:32,902 --> 01:24:36,550
He collaborated with Himmler.
He's a traitor.

721
01:24:39,678 --> 01:24:44,892
There's no mercy for traitors.
No compassion for them.

722
01:24:46,977 --> 01:24:50,105
He'll be court-martialled
and executed.

723
01:24:51,148 --> 01:24:53,233
What's the point of that?

724
01:24:55,319 --> 01:24:56,883
It is my wish.

725
01:25:10,794 --> 01:25:11,836
You're the Führer.

726
01:25:15,686 --> 01:25:16,729
Speak.

727
01:25:17,250 --> 01:25:19,857
The Russians are advancing
more and more.

728
01:25:20,378 --> 01:25:23,506
There are no more reserves.
Supplies from the air are impossible.

729
01:25:24,028 --> 01:25:26,635
There is no ammunition coming
in anymore.

730
01:25:30,805 --> 01:25:33,412
In the north, the Russians are standing
in front of the Weidendammer bridge.

731
01:25:33,933 --> 01:25:37,062
In the east: Lustgarten.
South: Potsdammer Platz.

732
01:25:37,583 --> 01:25:41,232
West: Tiergarten, about 400 metres
away from the chancellery.

733
01:25:42,275 --> 01:25:45,403
How long can you hold out?
-At most, two days.

734
01:25:46,446 --> 01:25:49,053
Including the government area?
-Yes.

735
01:25:50,095 --> 01:25:55,309
As a soldier, I suggest we
flee Berlin. It's surrounded.

736
01:25:55,830 --> 01:26:02,087
The battle of Berlin killed about
20,000 of our best officers.

737
01:26:02,088 --> 01:26:05,736
That's what young people are for.

738
01:26:06,779 --> 01:26:09,907
What you suggest is insane.
Ridiculous.

739
01:26:10,428 --> 01:26:13,556
Think of the thousands of wounded.
We can't help them.

740
01:26:13,557 --> 01:26:18,249
Mein Führer, the orders have been written.
I give you my word...

741
01:26:18,770 --> 01:26:23,462
The Führer cannot make a honourless
disappearance from world history.

742
01:26:23,984 --> 01:26:28,154
Even if an advance is successful...

743
01:26:28,676 --> 01:26:31,804
...I'll end up in another
troublesome situation.

744
01:26:32,325 --> 01:26:37,539
I'd have to stay in the open air
or on a farm...

745
01:26:38,060 --> 01:26:39,624
...and wait for the end.

746
01:26:41,188 --> 01:26:46,923
Wenck is advancing with the 12th army.
He can join the 9th...

747
01:26:47,265 --> 01:26:51,436
...and give the Russians
the final blow.

748
01:26:52,137 --> 01:26:56,308
Wenck's an excellent fellow.
Send a telegram to Keitel:

749
01:26:59,436 --> 01:27:05,171
Immediately report to me the following:
1. Where are Wenck's vanguard located?

750
01:27:06,213 --> 01:27:08,820
2. When will they attack again?

751
01:27:09,863 --> 01:27:15,598
3. Where is the 9th army?
4. Where will the 9th make a breakthrough?

752
01:27:17,683 --> 01:27:22,375
You'll see, gentlemen.
I'll be right.

753
01:27:22,897 --> 01:27:25,503
Wenck will come.

754
01:27:31,984 --> 01:27:34,069
Wenck will come.

755
01:27:47,303 --> 01:27:51,474
I want to know if Wenck
can do anything at all.

756
01:27:51,996 --> 01:27:56,688
It's unlikely that Wenck's
small amount of troops...

757
01:27:57,209 --> 01:28:01,901
What's unlikely about the offensive?
-Wenck can't do anything anymore.

758
01:28:02,423 --> 01:28:06,593
Then why don't you tell the Führer that?
Has everybody gone mad?

759
01:28:07,115 --> 01:28:10,243
Do you think the Führer doesn't know?
He'll never surrender.

760
01:28:10,764 --> 01:28:14,414
And neither will we. I've been
through that once. Never again.

761
01:28:14,935 --> 01:28:17,021
Come along. I have to go.

762
01:28:27,164 --> 01:28:28,728
Stop right there.

763
01:28:40,789 --> 01:28:42,353
Heil Hitler.

764
01:29:31,081 --> 01:29:33,688
Excuse me. I fell asleep.

765
01:29:34,209 --> 01:29:36,295
Did you get some rest, my child?

766
01:29:39,779 --> 01:29:41,865
In shorthand.

767
01:29:48,121 --> 01:29:51,770
My political will.

768
01:29:52,822 --> 01:29:58,035
More than 30 years have passed...

769
01:29:58,036 --> 01:30:02,727
...since I made my contribution
as a volunteer...

770
01:30:02,728 --> 01:30:06,898
...during the first World War.

771
01:30:07,419 --> 01:30:12,633
During those 30 years,
I learnt to think, act and live...

772
01:30:13,154 --> 01:30:16,283
...out of love and loyalty
for my people.

773
01:30:20,227 --> 01:30:23,877
Excuse me. The shooting.
-Please sit down.

774
01:30:27,607 --> 01:30:30,214
Centuries will pass...

775
01:30:30,735 --> 01:30:34,906
...but from the ruins
of our cities and monuments...

776
01:30:34,907 --> 01:30:40,641
...the hatred
of the people...

777
01:30:40,642 --> 01:30:43,769
...who did this to us,
will continue to flare up.

778
01:30:44,291 --> 01:30:48,462
International Judaism and
its allies.

779
01:30:59,663 --> 01:31:01,749
What is it, Herr Minister?

780
01:31:05,398 --> 01:31:08,005
Imagine this.
The Führer wants me to leave Berlin.

781
01:31:09,048 --> 01:31:11,133
He ordered it.

782
01:31:13,219 --> 01:31:16,868
I've never ignored an order
from the Führer.

783
01:31:25,567 --> 01:31:31,302
But I will ignore this order.
I'll stay with the Führer.

784
01:31:35,022 --> 01:31:37,107
Please, Frau Junge...

785
01:31:39,192 --> 01:31:42,321
...I want to dictate my will to you.

786
01:31:44,406 --> 01:31:47,534
I'm typing
the Führer's will.

787
01:31:48,577 --> 01:31:50,662
Good.

788
01:31:51,705 --> 01:31:54,312
I understand.
Some other time.

789
01:32:01,523 --> 01:32:06,737
Mein Führer, according to the racial law
I'm obliged to ask you:

790
01:32:07,258 --> 01:32:09,865
Mein Führer, are you
of Aryan descent?

791
01:32:14,807 --> 01:32:17,414
Can I see your identity card?

792
01:32:18,502 --> 01:32:21,630
You're talking to the Führer here.
-Alright then.

793
01:32:22,151 --> 01:32:25,801
And you, Fräulein Braun,
are you of Aryan descent?

794
01:32:26,635 --> 01:32:29,763
Then there's nothing
to stop us.

795
01:32:30,284 --> 01:32:33,934
I'm asking you now:
Do you, mein Führer, Adolf Hitler...

796
01:32:34,455 --> 01:32:39,669
...take Eva Braun, present here,
as your wife? Answer 'yes'.

797
01:32:41,754 --> 01:32:45,403
Do you, Eva Braun, take Führer
Adolf Hitler, present here...

798
01:32:45,925 --> 01:32:49,053
...as your husband?
Answer 'yes'.

799
01:32:50,617 --> 01:32:53,745
Then I declare you
man and wife.

800
01:33:33,108 --> 01:33:35,194
Two men here.

801
01:33:37,471 --> 01:33:39,035
Everything will be alright.

802
01:33:40,953 --> 01:33:43,560
You must go to the Führer right away.
-Now?

803
01:34:03,259 --> 01:34:07,430
How long can we hold out?
-Twenty hours, no more.

804
01:34:08,994 --> 01:34:14,729
The Russians are close. At the moment,
we forced them to stop.

805
01:34:15,251 --> 01:34:20,464
You know, Mohnke. The western
democracies are decadent.

806
01:34:20,986 --> 01:34:26,199
They'll succumb to
the people from the east.

807
01:34:29,327 --> 01:34:31,934
All the best. Thank you.

808
01:34:32,977 --> 01:34:36,105
It wasn't just for Germany.

809
01:34:56,035 --> 01:34:58,121
A message from Keitel.

810
01:35:01,049 --> 01:35:04,367
1. Wenck's vanguard are
stuck south of Schwielowsee.

811
01:35:04,888 --> 01:35:08,537
2. The 12th army can't continue
the attack on Berlin.

812
01:35:09,580 --> 01:35:13,230
3. The 9th army is
completely surrounded.

813
01:35:33,203 --> 01:35:38,416
What do we do when the last
ammunition reserves have been exhausted?

814
01:35:39,459 --> 01:35:42,587
I'll never surrender. Never.

815
01:35:44,673 --> 01:35:49,886
I forbid you, and the other
commanders, to surrender.

816
01:36:01,899 --> 01:36:07,634
Listen, Günsche. My wife and I
are going to commit suicide.

817
01:36:08,155 --> 01:36:12,326
I don't want my corpse
exposed by the Russians.

818
01:36:12,848 --> 01:36:15,976
I don't want them to get me,
dead or alive.

819
01:36:16,497 --> 01:36:20,147
I want to be burnt
and never to be found.

820
01:36:24,317 --> 01:36:27,446
Günsche, I want you to promise me...

821
01:36:27,967 --> 01:36:33,180
...that you will do
all that it takes.

822
01:36:33,702 --> 01:36:35,787
Mein Führer...

823
01:36:35,788 --> 01:36:39,958
...this is a terrible order,
but I will execute it.

824
01:37:07,236 --> 01:37:10,364
Kempka.
-Erich, I need 200 litres of petrol.

825
01:37:10,366 --> 01:37:14,014
Are you mad?
Where should I find them?

826
01:37:14,535 --> 01:37:16,621
From the parked vehicles.

827
01:37:17,663 --> 01:37:20,270
What's all that petrol for?
-I can't say.

828
01:37:36,959 --> 01:37:40,087
Come, please.
The Führer wants to see us.

829
01:37:49,543 --> 01:37:52,150
Should I tell the Führer
you're indisposed?

830
01:37:53,193 --> 01:37:56,321
It's only my collapsed lung.

831
01:37:58,364 --> 01:38:00,449
I'll die soon anyway.

832
01:38:45,963 --> 01:38:48,049
Excuse me.

833
01:39:00,621 --> 01:39:02,706
Over here, Herr Professor.

834
01:39:11,711 --> 01:39:14,318
One moment, please.

835
01:39:23,556 --> 01:39:25,120
Excuse me.

836
01:39:58,555 --> 01:40:02,725
I'm sorry to interrupt
your important work.

837
01:40:03,247 --> 01:40:07,418
Mein Führer, keep faith
in the final victory.

838
01:40:07,939 --> 01:40:12,631
Lead us
and we shall follow.

839
01:40:16,428 --> 01:40:17,992
Come along.

840
01:40:25,261 --> 01:40:27,347
Join the gang.

841
01:40:29,584 --> 01:40:32,190
Come. Have a drink.

842
01:40:33,233 --> 01:40:36,882
Besides drinking, there's little we can do.
-Do sit down.

843
01:40:37,404 --> 01:40:44,181
That's better.
Yes, the situation is pretty shitty.

844
01:40:48,352 --> 01:40:52,002
Can we sit down?
-Please do, Fräulein...

845
01:40:52,523 --> 01:40:56,694
Frau...
-That's Frau Hitler.

846
01:40:59,301 --> 01:41:00,865
It's alright.

847
01:41:02,950 --> 01:41:05,557
A pity we can't go
outside anymore.

848
01:41:06,078 --> 01:41:09,206
Only if you want
to die a heroic death.

849
01:41:09,728 --> 01:41:15,463
Fritz, control yourself a bit.
-Yes. Control.

850
01:41:16,505 --> 01:41:18,069
Take cover.

851
01:41:39,546 --> 01:41:43,196
What are you doing here?
-I have to report to the Führer.

852
01:41:43,717 --> 01:41:45,802
You can't right now.
Sit down.

853
01:41:46,324 --> 01:41:48,409
Sit. Drink.

854
01:41:52,580 --> 01:41:54,665
Let me introduce Frau Hitler.

855
01:41:54,667 --> 01:41:58,836
So young and so many decorations.
You must be proud.

856
01:42:01,964 --> 01:42:04,571
Excuse me.
I'm not used to drinking anymore.

857
01:42:05,614 --> 01:42:08,221
You can use our toilet.

858
01:42:16,018 --> 01:42:21,232
If your hand shakes, the bullet
might only hit an optic nerve.

859
01:42:21,753 --> 01:42:26,445
That's why it's good
to also take the poison.

860
01:42:26,967 --> 01:42:31,659
When you bite through the capsule,
pull the trigger.

861
01:42:32,180 --> 01:42:34,265
Will I have enough time?

862
01:42:35,308 --> 01:42:37,915
The poison starts working
after one or two seconds.

863
01:42:55,331 --> 01:42:57,938
Tornow, you too.

864
01:43:06,978 --> 01:43:08,542
Come Blondi.

865
01:43:40,216 --> 01:43:42,823
You know, Frau Junge,
I've known...

866
01:43:43,865 --> 01:43:46,472
my husband for
more than 15 years.

867
01:43:46,993 --> 01:43:51,686
But when I think about it,
I know nothing about him.

868
01:43:52,207 --> 01:43:54,292
Even though he likes to talk.

869
01:43:57,421 --> 01:44:02,113
I longed for Berlin,
but he's so different now.

870
01:44:02,634 --> 01:44:06,284
He only talks about dogs
and vegetarian food now.

871
01:44:06,805 --> 01:44:09,412
I hate Blondi.

872
01:44:10,976 --> 01:44:16,189
I sometimes kick her and Adolf
then wonders why she acts strange.

873
01:44:27,138 --> 01:44:29,744
I think he doesn't want anybody
to really know him.

874
01:44:32,873 --> 01:44:37,565
...he can be so caring
in his private life.

875
01:44:39,129 --> 01:44:43,821
And then he uses
that rude language again.

876
01:44:44,864 --> 01:44:46,949
When he's the Führer, you mean?

877
01:44:48,513 --> 01:44:51,641
Come, let's smoke another one.

878
01:45:13,437 --> 01:45:15,001
I'm sorry.

879
01:45:17,073 --> 01:45:21,244
You have so many worries
and here I am, whining.

880
01:45:22,287 --> 01:45:25,936
Frau Junge, I'm giving you this coat
as a goodbye present.

881
01:45:26,979 --> 01:45:31,671
I like fashionable ladies.
I want you to enjoy it.

882
01:45:32,714 --> 01:45:35,320
What a surprise. Thank you.

883
01:45:36,885 --> 01:45:40,534
I just don't know where and when
I can wear it.

884
01:45:42,098 --> 01:45:45,226
Please, try to get out of here.

885
01:45:46,790 --> 01:45:48,354
Promise me.

886
01:47:17,792 --> 01:47:22,595
Thank you. That was very good,
Fräulein Manziarly.

887
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:47,771
The time has come. It's finished.

888
01:48:26,595 --> 01:48:28,680
The Führer wants to say goodbye.
Come with me.

889
01:49:00,663 --> 01:49:03,791
You're the bravest mother
of the Reich.

890
01:49:04,313 --> 01:49:08,484
Führer, you made me the happiest
woman in Germany.

891
01:49:32,611 --> 01:49:34,696
Salute my beautiful Bavaria.

892
01:49:58,300 --> 01:50:00,386
Children, what are you doing here?

893
01:50:00,907 --> 01:50:03,514
We want to see aunt Eva
and uncle Hitler.

894
01:50:04,035 --> 01:50:07,685
Have you eaten anything yet?
-Only breakfast.

895
01:50:09,249 --> 01:50:12,898
Stay here, I'll get something to eat.
I'll be right back.

896
01:50:22,084 --> 01:50:26,777
Comrades, this is the
latest news from the outside.

897
01:50:27,298 --> 01:50:32,511
Berlin is full of warehouses: There were
houses here, there were houses there.

898
01:50:38,034 --> 01:50:40,119
Herr Günsche,
I want to speak to the Führer.

899
01:50:42,204 --> 01:50:43,769
Please, I have to.

900
01:50:44,290 --> 01:50:46,897
Frau Goebbels, the Führer
doesn't want to be disturbed.

901
01:50:46,898 --> 01:50:50,025
Please, Günsche,
just for a moment.

902
01:50:50,546 --> 01:50:52,110
Please.

903
01:50:59,574 --> 01:51:02,181
Mein Führer, Frau Goebbels is here.

904
01:51:08,654 --> 01:51:10,218
What is it?

905
01:51:10,739 --> 01:51:14,389
Mein Führer, I beg you:
Leave Berlin.

906
01:51:15,431 --> 01:51:21,166
Don't leave us Führer.
What will become of us?

907
01:51:25,048 --> 01:51:32,347
Tomorrow, I'll be cursed by millions,
but that's how it is.

908
01:51:35,146 --> 01:51:37,231
Get up. Come.

909
01:51:39,838 --> 01:51:41,924
Come.

910
01:51:50,258 --> 01:51:52,865
Aunt Traudl, I like it
when it thunders.

911
01:51:53,386 --> 01:51:57,036
Why?
-Nothing can happen to us here.

912
01:51:57,557 --> 01:51:59,642
Can it?
-No.

913
01:52:09,148 --> 01:52:10,712
Gotcha.

914
01:52:33,724 --> 01:52:37,374
Reichsleiter, it's over.

915
01:52:56,237 --> 01:52:58,844
The Führer is dead.

916
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:16,685
There's daddy.

917
01:53:28,149 --> 01:53:31,798
Are you crazy?
For that damned petrol of yours...

918
01:53:32,319 --> 01:53:34,405
Erich, shut up.

919
01:53:44,854 --> 01:53:46,418
Stand back.

920
01:53:59,871 --> 01:54:01,435
Come on, continue.

921
01:54:01,956 --> 01:54:03,520
Continue.

922
01:55:32,990 --> 01:55:36,118
No, don't.

923
01:55:37,399 --> 01:55:39,484
Let grandpa go.

924
01:55:45,833 --> 01:55:49,483
Order. Order.
We must have order.

925
01:55:50,525 --> 01:55:53,132
Order has to return.

926
01:56:07,453 --> 01:56:11,623
This way. We know the way.
You can trust us.

927
01:56:12,666 --> 01:56:14,230
Hurry.

928
01:56:20,740 --> 01:56:23,347
I was on the side of
the Red Beasts.

929
01:56:27,381 --> 01:56:29,466
I supported the Bolsheviks.

930
01:56:36,958 --> 01:56:38,522
Let's hope the Russians
got our message.

931
01:56:39,044 --> 01:56:41,650
We'll soon find out.
-Or not.

932
01:56:46,869 --> 01:56:49,997
What news do you have, General?

933
01:56:50,519 --> 01:56:55,732
Adolf Hitler and his wife
committed suicide in the bunker.

934
01:56:58,860 --> 01:57:03,031
The new government
authorised me...

935
01:57:05,117 --> 01:57:08,245
...to start peace talks...

936
01:57:08,766 --> 01:57:15,022
...between our countries, that both
suffered severe losses.

937
01:57:16,065 --> 01:57:20,757
General, if you were me,
would you make peace with you?

938
01:57:21,279 --> 01:57:25,449
My government will never accept
unconditional surrender.

939
01:57:28,056 --> 01:57:32,227
Given the situation,
you have no other choice.

940
01:57:35,355 --> 01:57:37,962
Surrender? Never.
That's shameful.

941
01:57:39,005 --> 01:57:41,090
Years ago, I conquered
Berlin on the Reds...

942
01:57:41,611 --> 01:57:45,782
...and I'll defend the city
to my dying day.

943
01:57:46,825 --> 01:57:49,432
In the short time I have
as Chancellor...

944
01:57:49,953 --> 01:57:54,124
...I'll never sign
a surrender treaty.

945
01:57:54,645 --> 01:57:57,773
It's for the sake of the people.
-The Führer's orders are final.

946
01:57:58,295 --> 01:58:01,944
This is crazy.
We have to start negotiations.

947
01:58:02,466 --> 01:58:05,594
I repeat, gentlemen:
I do not surrender.

948
01:58:06,636 --> 01:58:09,243
Send a message to Marshal Zhukov.
-Zhukov?

949
01:58:09,765 --> 01:58:12,371
What's happening?
-We're surrendering.

950
01:58:12,893 --> 01:58:16,021
Then I must kill you.
The Führer forbids any surrender.

951
01:58:36,135 --> 01:58:39,263
How long does it work?
-Around four hours.

952
01:59:16,423 --> 01:59:21,636
Children, the doctor has the medication
I told you about.

953
01:59:22,158 --> 01:59:24,765
It's a bit bitter,
but it will work.

954
01:59:26,329 --> 01:59:27,893
A sip for everybody.

955
01:59:29,457 --> 01:59:31,542
Who wants to go first?

956
01:59:34,149 --> 01:59:37,798
Heide, you're always so brave?

957
01:59:43,533 --> 01:59:45,097
Have another sip.

958
01:59:48,225 --> 01:59:50,311
See? That wasn't so bad.

959
01:59:55,462 --> 01:59:57,547
Well done.
Helmut.

960
02:00:00,675 --> 02:00:05,368
This medication makes sure you don't
get ill in this humid bunker.

961
02:00:05,889 --> 02:00:08,496
But it's not humid
in the bunker.

962
02:00:13,188 --> 02:00:14,752
Well done.

963
02:00:24,016 --> 02:00:25,581
Helga.

964
02:00:28,307 --> 02:00:29,350
I don't want to.

965
02:00:29,871 --> 02:00:34,500
What's that? Do you want to get sick?
-Please, mama. I don't want to drink it.

966
02:00:38,149 --> 02:00:42,320
Don't cry, baby.
That doesn't help.

967
02:00:42,842 --> 02:00:44,927
You have to drink the medicine.

968
02:00:48,576 --> 02:00:50,141
Helga.

969
02:00:55,875 --> 02:00:58,482
Come on, open your mouth.

970
02:01:19,801 --> 02:01:21,365
Goodnight, children.

971
02:01:32,130 --> 02:01:35,259
One day the lie will fall apart...

972
02:01:35,260 --> 02:01:38,387
...and there will be light
in the darkness.

973
02:01:39,429 --> 02:01:40,993
Please read that.

974
02:01:42,036 --> 02:01:46,728
One day the lie will fall apart
and there will be light in the darkness.

975
02:01:48,292 --> 02:01:51,421
Let's do it differently.
One day the lie will collapse...

976
02:01:51,942 --> 02:01:56,634
...and truth will triumph
once again.

977
02:01:57,155 --> 02:02:00,805
At that moment, we will
stand above everybody...

978
02:02:01,326 --> 02:02:03,412
...pure and...

979
02:02:06,540 --> 02:02:08,625
immaculate.

980
02:06:15,552 --> 02:06:18,681
We don't stand a chance.
-So what? I want to get away.

981
02:06:19,202 --> 02:06:20,766
How do we get
through the lines?

982
02:06:21,287 --> 02:06:23,894
Doesn't matter.
I'm not staying another minute.

983
02:06:24,415 --> 02:06:27,544
We'll die.
-It won't be that bad, surely.

984
02:06:28,586 --> 02:06:31,193
If we stay, the Russians
will get us for sure.

985
02:06:33,278 --> 02:06:34,321
All the best.

986
02:06:34,843 --> 02:06:36,928
Come, let's go.

987
02:08:05,750 --> 02:08:12,481
On 30 April 1945, the Führer
committed suicide...

988
02:08:12,482 --> 02:08:18,216
...and in doing so, he deserted
everybody who was loyal to him.

989
02:08:18,737 --> 02:08:23,951
You, German soldiers, were loyal to
the Führer and were prepared...

990
02:08:24,472 --> 02:08:30,728
...to continue the battle for Berlin,
although ammunition was in short supply...

991
02:08:31,250 --> 02:08:35,942
...and further resistance
was pointless.

992
02:08:36,463 --> 02:08:40,113
I hereby declare an
immediate cease-fire.

993
02:08:41,677 --> 02:08:44,283
Each hour you continue fighting...

994
02:08:44,805 --> 02:08:51,582
...prolongs the suffering of the people
of Berlin and of our wounded.

995
02:08:52,104 --> 02:08:55,753
In agreement with the supreme
command of the Soviet troops...

996
02:08:56,275 --> 02:09:02,009
...I order you to stop
fighting immediately.

997
02:09:02,531 --> 02:09:09,830
Weidling, former commander
of the Berlin defence area.

998
02:09:11,394 --> 02:09:13,479
A glass of water, please.

999
02:10:19,184 --> 02:10:21,790
I don't need you anymore.

1000
02:10:24,918 --> 02:10:27,525
The game's over.

1001
02:11:35,284 --> 02:11:37,890
It's time.
-Don't you see what's going on here?

1002
02:11:38,412 --> 02:11:41,540
I insist that you help us,
as a doctor.

1003
02:11:42,583 --> 02:11:44,668
Alright, then.

1004
02:11:51,967 --> 02:11:56,659
Go. You did a lot.
Thank you.

1005
02:12:03,413 --> 02:12:09,503
Schädle, hurry. Come on.
-I'm not going anywhere anymore.

1006
02:12:12,110 --> 02:12:13,674
Come along.

1007
02:12:52,295 --> 02:12:54,902
Are you alright?
-Keep going.

1008
02:13:31,724 --> 02:13:35,373
Sturmmann Krüger and his group
defended the Wolf Bridge...

1009
02:13:35,895 --> 02:13:38,502
...and he receives the Iron Cross.

1010
02:13:39,023 --> 02:13:43,194
Sturmmann Wagner took out two
machine-gun nests...

1011
02:13:43,715 --> 02:13:46,843
...and therefore, receives
the Iron Cross.

1012
02:13:47,365 --> 02:13:51,014
Sturmmann Rauch has gotten
messages through the lines...

1013
02:13:51,535 --> 02:13:54,142
...and receives the Iron Cross.

1014
02:14:25,327 --> 02:14:27,412
The others are coming.

1015
02:14:34,054 --> 02:14:36,139
Take cover, Müller.

1016
02:14:55,776 --> 02:14:56,818
Who's that?

1017
02:15:04,477 --> 02:15:06,563
A German.

1018
02:15:12,187 --> 02:15:13,751
Herr Hewel?

1019
02:15:17,400 --> 02:15:19,486
Thank God, you're alive.

1020
02:15:21,571 --> 02:15:23,135
Where are the others?

1021
02:15:25,742 --> 02:15:29,913
I don't know, Frau Junge.
Somewhere. Maybe.

1022
02:15:30,434 --> 02:15:33,562
Most people from my group
must be dead.

1023
02:15:34,084 --> 02:15:36,691
I should never
have left that bunker.

1024
02:15:37,212 --> 02:15:41,904
I should have shot myself,
but I couldn't.

1025
02:15:43,990 --> 02:15:47,118
Eat something first.
There's always enough time to die.

1026
02:16:44,468 --> 02:16:47,075
You stay with the women.

1027
02:16:48,203 --> 02:16:49,767
Come along.

1028
02:17:02,304 --> 02:17:05,954
The Russians have surrounded us.
-What's going to happen to us?

1029
02:17:06,475 --> 02:17:09,082
Maybe you can get through.
You could try.

1030
02:17:09,603 --> 02:17:11,167
I'm not taking another step.

1031
02:17:12,210 --> 02:17:16,902
Think about it. The Russians
are after us.

1032
02:17:17,424 --> 02:17:22,637
As a woman, you might have a chance.
Try it.

1033
02:17:23,680 --> 02:17:25,244
Good luck.

1034
02:17:27,851 --> 02:17:32,022
When you walk past the Russians,
don't look them in the eyes.

1035
02:17:32,543 --> 02:17:36,192
Remember that well. All the best.

1036
02:17:45,221 --> 02:17:46,785
The Russians.

1037
02:17:59,368 --> 02:18:01,974
Gerda, let's go.
-You go.

1038
02:18:02,496 --> 02:18:05,624
I'm exhausted.
-Please.

1039
02:18:07,709 --> 02:18:11,880
I have to give it a try.
Don't be angry with me.

1040
02:18:16,051 --> 02:18:17,615
I'll be alright.

1041
02:18:30,729 --> 02:18:32,293
Herr Doktor.

1042
02:18:32,815 --> 02:18:37,507
My comrades want to surrender.
Can I join you?

1043
02:18:38,028 --> 02:18:41,678
The Führer's dead. Do you want
to continue the war on your own?

1044
02:18:42,199 --> 02:18:43,763
I'm obliged by my oath.

1045
02:18:44,284 --> 02:18:48,977
Then you'd better go
to the Brigadeführer.

1046
02:19:17,620 --> 02:19:19,184
The Russians are evacuating the square.
-So?

1047
02:19:20,227 --> 02:19:22,312
No opposition.
No shooting.

1048
02:19:22,832 --> 02:19:25,439
Then they'll be
here within the hour.

1049
02:19:25,961 --> 02:19:28,046
What shall we do?

1050
02:19:28,047 --> 02:19:32,738
We can't surrender.
-What exactly do you mean?

1051
02:19:33,259 --> 02:19:36,909
When the Russians come,
we'll empty our weapons on them.

1052
02:19:37,430 --> 02:19:41,080
The last bullets are for ourselves.
-That's radical.

1053
02:19:41,081 --> 02:19:46,293
Is this prestigious murder and suicide
our only option?

1054
02:19:46,815 --> 02:19:50,464
We're SS officers.
We can't survive the Führer.

1055
02:19:50,464 --> 02:19:53,592
Who agrees with me?

1056
02:21:41,154 --> 02:21:44,282
Come and sit down with me?
-Please.

1057
02:21:50,105 --> 02:21:55,318
Why do you want to continue living?
-And you? Why do you want to die?

1058
02:21:56,882 --> 02:21:58,968
See this?

1059
02:21:59,489 --> 02:22:02,617
The Führer gave it
to me personally.

1060
02:22:03,139 --> 02:22:06,788
As a last decoration?
-Maybe.

1061
02:22:07,309 --> 02:22:12,002
A goodbye present from Hitler.
I had to promise him something.

1062
02:22:12,003 --> 02:22:17,215
If the Russians get me,
I have to kill myself.

1063
02:22:19,301 --> 02:22:23,471
Did he make you promise that?
But why?

1064
02:22:23,993 --> 02:22:27,121
Maybe he didn't want
me to be forced...

1065
02:22:27,642 --> 02:22:29,728
...to say anything bad
about him.

1066
02:22:30,249 --> 02:22:34,420
But, as a diplomat,
you're under international protection.

1067
02:22:34,941 --> 02:22:38,591
Who will benefit
if you stick to your deal?

1068
02:22:39,112 --> 02:22:40,676
There they are.

1069
02:22:53,834 --> 02:22:55,398
Don't shoot, comrades.

1070
02:22:59,321 --> 02:23:04,013
We surrendered.
The war is over.

1071
02:23:05,056 --> 02:23:07,141
It's over.

1072
02:24:40,867 --> 02:24:43,995
Complete surrender took place
on 7 May 1945.

1073
02:24:46,081 --> 02:24:49,209
Hostilities were suspended
on 8 May.

1074
02:24:51,294 --> 02:24:54,944
The war took the lives of more
than 50 million people.

1075
02:24:56,508 --> 02:25:01,721

in German concentration camps.

and avoid imprisonment.

1077
02:25:07,978 --> 02:25:11,106
She died in Düsseldorf
on 14 April 1997.

1078
02:25:11,627 --> 02:25:15,798

by the Soviets.

1079

on 21 December 1998.

1080
02:25:21,533 --> 02:25:24,140

by the Soviets in 1955.

on 6 August 2001.

1082
02:25:29,353 --> 02:25:35,609

captivity, in 1955.

1083

in the bunker, by the Red Army.

1084
02:25:41,866 --> 02:25:44,994
He died in captivity,
in 1945.

1085

by the Soviets.

1086
02:25:49,165 --> 02:25:53,335

1087
02:25:53,857 --> 02:25:58,549

and would break many flying records.

1088
02:25:59,070 --> 02:26:01,677

died in 1980.

1092
02:26:14,190 --> 02:26:17,318

1093

He was sentenced to
20 years, in Nuremberg.

1096
02:26:31,394 --> 02:26:34,001
He was released in 1966 and

1097
02:26:35,044 --> 02:26:41,300

death in Nuremberg and executed.

1098

1099
02:26:45,471 --> 02:26:48,599
He committed suicide in his cell,
shortly before his execution.

1100
02:26:49,120 --> 02:26:53,813
Heinrich Himmler tried to escape
using a false name.

1101
02:26:54,334 --> 02:26:57,462

he committed suicide.

1102

Martin Bormann and Ludwig
Stumpfegger committed suicide...

1103
02:27:03,197 --> 02:27:06,325
...on 2 May 1945,
near the Lehrter Bahnhof.

1104
02:27:07,368 --> 02:27:11,539
Rochus Misch was released
by the Soviets in 1955.

1105
02:27:12,060 --> 02:27:14,145
He still lives in Berlin.

1106
02:27:14,667 --> 02:27:17,273
Traudl Junge was classified
as a 'young follower'.

1107
02:27:17,795 --> 02:27:20,923
She worked as a secretary and lived
in Munich, until her death in 2002.

1108
02:27:21,444 --> 02:27:26,658
All the horror I heard about during
the Nuremberg trial...

1109
02:27:26,659 --> 02:27:33,435
...the 6 million Jews, dissidents
or people of another race...

1110
02:27:33,957 --> 02:27:39,692
...who died, shocked me deeply.

1111
02:27:40,734 --> 02:27:45,427
But I hadn't made the connection
with my own past yet.

1112
02:27:46,469 --> 02:27:51,162
I reassured myself by thinking
I wasn't personally guilty of it.

1113
02:27:51,683 --> 02:27:56,896
And that I hadn't known
about the sheer size of it.

1114
02:27:57,418 --> 02:28:03,674
But one day, I walked
past a commemorative plaque...

1115
02:28:04,195 --> 02:28:07,845
...for Sophie Scholl,
here in the Franz-Joseph-Strasse.

1116
02:28:08,888 --> 02:28:11,494
I saw that she was my age...

1117
02:28:12,016 --> 02:28:17,751
...and that she was executed in
the year I joined Hitler.

1118
02:28:18,272 --> 02:28:23,486
And only then did I realise...

1119
02:28:24,528 --> 02:28:27,135
that youth is no excuse.

1120
02:28:27,656 --> 02:28:33,913
And that it might have been
possible to find out the truth.

1121
02:31:09,958 --> 02:31:13,086
DOWNFALL
