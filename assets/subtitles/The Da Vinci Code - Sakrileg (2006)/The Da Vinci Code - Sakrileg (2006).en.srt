1
00:00:15,501 --> 00:00:30,501
BTSFilms - Always a Good Movie!

2
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:16,594
Stop now.

3
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:18,994
Tell me where it is.

4
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:28,673
You and your brethren possess
what is not rightfully yours.

5
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:33,208
l don`t know what
you are talking about.

6
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:36,248
ls it a secret you will die for?

7
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:39,721
-Please.
-As you wish.

8
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,525
Wait!

9
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,826
My God, forgive me.

10
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,303
ln the sacristy...

11
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:54,937
...the church of Saint-Sulpice,
is the Rose Line.

12
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:57,268
Beneath the Rose.

13
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:01,445
Thank you.

14
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,341
Thank you.

15
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,284
Thank you.

16
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:54,465
Symbols are a language that
can help us understand our past.

17
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:59,368
As the saying goes,
a picture says a thousand words...

18
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,564
...but which words?

19
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,901
lnterpret for me, please, this symbol.
First thing that comes to mind.

20
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:09,411
-Hatred, racism.
-Ku KluX Klan.

21
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:14,883
Yes, yes, interesting. But they would
disagree with you in Spain.

22
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:18,521
There, they are robes
worn by priests.

23
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,883
Now this symbol. Anyone?

24
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,250
Evil.

25
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:24,655
ln English, please.

26
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:25,922
Devil`s pitchfork.

27
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:28,293
Poor, poor Poseidon.

28
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:34,001
That is his trident. A symbol of power
to millions of the ancients.

29
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:35,367
Now this symbol.

30
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,910
-Madonna and child.
-Faith. Christianity.

31
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,843
No. No, it`s the pagan god
Horus and his mother, lsis...

32
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:45,609
...centuries before
the birth of Christ.

33
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:49,515
Understanding our past
determines actively...

34
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:52,782
...our ability to understand
the present.

35
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:57,620
So how do we sift truth from belief?

36
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:01,424
How do we write our own histories,
personally or culturally...

37
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,693
...and thereby define ourselves?

38
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:08,272
How do we penetrate years,
centuries, of historical distortion...

39
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,506
...to find original truth?

40
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:14,908
Tonight, this will be our quest.

41
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,447
l still think that his whole take on phi
was a little far-fetched.

42
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:24,817
l don`t think so. l think that the
golden ratio is everywhere in nature.

43
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:27,248
Sure, l can do that.

44
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,429
My son is a student
of yours at Harvard.

45
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,860
-Michael Culp? He adores you.
-Oh, yeah.

46
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:35,124
He says you`re the best teacher
he`s ever had.

47
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:39,294
Ms. Culp, l think l already gave
Michael an A-minus.

48
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,870
He told me. Thank you.

49
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,371
Mr. Langdon?

50
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,407
Hi.

51
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:45,972
Bonjour, professor.

52
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:52,181
l`m Lieutenant Collet from DCPJ.
A kind of French FBl.

53
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,245
Will you take a look
at this photo, please?

54
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:58,322
My police chief, Capitaine Fache,
had hoped...

55
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:02,085
...considering your eXpertise
and the markings on the body...

56
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:03,762
...you might assist us.

57
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,565
Will you eXcuse me a moment?

58
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:19,675
l was supposed to have
drinks with him.

59
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,073
Yes, we know.

60
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,542
We found your name
in his daily planner.

61
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,482
He never showed.
l waited for over an hour.

62
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,386
Why would someone do this to him?

63
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:37,654
Oh, you misunderstand, professor.

64
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,123
He was shot, yes.

65
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,993
But what you see
in the photograph...

66
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:45,796
...Monsieur Saunière did to himself.

67
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:53,207
Teacher, all four are dead.

68
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:57,139
The sénéchaux and the
Grand Master himself.

69
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,410
Then I assume
you have the location.

70
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,680
Confirmed by all.

71
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,290
lndependently.

72
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:11,393
I had feared the Priory`s penchant
for secrecy might prevail.

73
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:19,028
The prospect of death
is strong motivation.

74
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:24,874
lt is here.

75
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:27,578
ln Paris, Teacher.

76
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:33,986
lt hides beneath the Rose
in Saint-Sulpice.

77
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,216
You will go forth, Silas.

78
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:53,665
l chastise my body.

79
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,563
Capitaine Fache is waiting for you.

80
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,211
Okay.

81
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:55,960
-Mr. Langdon.
-Yes.

82
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:58,395
l`m Captain Bezu Fache.

83
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:00,830
You like our pyramid?

84
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,091
lt`s magnificent.

85
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,835
A scar on the face of Paris.

86
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,802
After me, please.

87
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:17,607
lt`s the pairing
of those two pyramids.

88
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,414
lt`s unique.

89
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,746
The two are geometric echoes.

90
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:22,921
Fascinating.

91
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:29,218
l`m not sure how much help
l`m gonna be here this evening.

92
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,790
How well did you know the curator?

93
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:39,199
Not at all. We met only once.

94
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,703
We were on a....

95
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:44,068
On a panel together.

96
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:46,870
Something is funny?

97
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:48,737
We didn`t agree on much.

98
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:52,509
Frankly, l was surprised
when he contacted me.

99
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:02,959
Could we take the stairs?

100
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:20,808
So Saunière requested
tonight`s meeting.

101
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,139
Yes.

102
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,815
How? Did he call you?

103
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:28,715
E-mail. He heard l was in Paris.

104
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,586
Had something to discuss.

105
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:32,883
What?

106
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:41,195
You seem uncomfortable.

107
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:59,943
-Are any of those real?
-Of course not.

108
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:03,883
So you know something
of security procedures.

109
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:08,288
Well, l know video surveillance in
a museum this size is cost-prohibitive.

110
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,985
Most now rely on containment.

111
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:14,394
Yes, forget about
keeping the criminals out.

112
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,761
Now we keep them in.

113
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:26,402
The Grand Gallery.
This is where you found the body.

114
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:28,375
How would you know that?

115
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:34,318
l recognize the parquet floor
from the Polaroid. lt`s unmistakable.

116
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:45,026
Dear God.

117
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:51,134
Let`s cover the talking points again,
Your Eminence.

118
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:54,204
Many call Opus Dei
a brainwashing cult.

119
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:57,569
Others, an ultraconservative
Christian secret society.

120
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,473
-We are a simple Catholic church.
-Simple?

121
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:03,409
With a brand-new $4 7-million
headquarters in Manhattan.

122
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,676
Our followers are generous,
should we apologize for that?

123
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:09,184
Perhaps a less defensive tack,
Your Eminence.

124
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:11,515
The press continue
to be harsh with us.

125
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:17,489
We are not Cafeteria Catholics.

126
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:19,721
We don`t pick and choose
which rules to follow.

127
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:22,560
We follow doctrine. Rigorously.

128
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:27,100
Does doctrine necessarily
include vows of chastity, tithing...

129
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:30,434
...and atonement for sins through
self-flagellation and the cilice?

130
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:35,071
Many of our followers are married.
Many of them have families.

131
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:38,214
Only a small proportion
choose to live ascetically...

132
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:41,011
...in the cloisters
of our residential halls.

133
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:44,522
But we are all united in God`s work
around the world.

134
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:48,523
Surely that is an admirable way
to lead one`s life.

135
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:51,586
Why are some media referring
to Opus Dei as ``God`s mafia``?

136
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:55,528
Obviously, some people fear
what they don`t understand.

137
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,637
And because the war finally
draws to a close.

138
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,832
-Bishop, we need to stay on message.
-That will be all, Michael, thank you.

139
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:05,237
Aringarosa.

140
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:10,075
Silas has succeeded.
The legend is true.

141
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,281
It hides beneath the Rose.

142
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:15,610
My part of our bargain
is nearly fulfilled.

143
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:19,214
l meet the council in an hour.

144
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:23,256
l will have your money tonight,
Teacher.

145
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,324
The Vitruvian Man.

146
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,729
lt`s one of Leonardo da Vinci`s
most famous sketches.

147
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:31,869
And the star on his skin?

148
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,338
A pentacle.

149
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,166
And its meaning?

150
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,739
The pentacle is ancient.

151
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:42,808
Symbols carry different meanings
in different settings.

152
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:45,609
This symbol, professor.
This setting.

153
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:48,013
The pentacle is
a pagan religious icon.

154
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:50,245
Devil worship.

155
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:55,223
No. No, no, no.
The pentacle before that.

156
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,889
This is a symbol for Venus.

157
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,896
lt represents the female half
of all things.

158
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,263
lt`s a concept called ``the divine
goddess`` by religious historians.

159
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,999
You are telling me that
Saunière`s last act on earth...

160
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:13,645
...was to draw a goddess symbol
on his chest? Why?

161
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:18,279
Captain Fache,
obviously l can`t tell you why.

162
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:22,779
l can tell you he, as well as anyone,
knows the meaning of this symbol...

163
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:25,718
...and it has nothing to do
with worshiping the devil.

164
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,290
-ls that so?
-Yes.

165
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:28,721
Then...

166
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:31,859
...what do you make of this?

167
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:36,530
``O, Draconian devil.
Oh, lame saint.``

168
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:39,932
lt`s a phrase.
Doesn`t mean anything, not to me.

169
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,799
What would you do if you had such
limited time to send a message?

170
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:49,873
Well, l suppose
l`d try to identify my killer.

171
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:51,674
Precisely.

172
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:54,045
Precisely.

173
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,345
So, professor--

174
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:58,881
Officer Neveu.

175
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:00,581
Please, pardon the interruption.

176
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:01,760
This is not the time.

177
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,088
l received the crime-scene jpegs
at headquarters...

178
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,093
...and l`ve deciphered the code.

179
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:07,990
lt`s a Fibonacci sequence.

180
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,600
That`s the code Saunière
left on the floor.

181
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:13,029
Headquarters sent me
to eXplain, captain.

182
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:14,500
lt is the Fibonacci sequence.

183
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,174
The numbers are out of order.

184
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:19,173
But before that, l have an urgent
message for Professor Langdon.

185
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:20,811
Right?

186
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:22,241
Pardon me?

187
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:27,676
l`m Sophie Neveu,
French police, Cryptology.

188
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,877
Your embassy called Division.

189
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:38,959
l`m sorry, monsieur, they said
it was a matter of life and death.

190
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:43,299
This is the number of your
embassy`s messaging service.

191
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:45,267
Well, thank you.

192
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,739
Hello, you`ve reached
the home of Sophie Neveu.

193
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,377
Miss Neveu? This....

194
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,108
No. That`s the right number.

195
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,810
You have to dial an access code
to pick up your messages.

196
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:03,989
But l`m getting--

197
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:07,090
lt`s a three-digit code.
lt`s on the paper l gave you.

198
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:19,161
Professor Langdon,
do not react to this message.

199
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,602
You must follow my directions
very closely and, above all...

200
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:25,106
...reveal nothing to Captain Fache.

201
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,369
You are in grave danger.

202
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,216
Church of Saint-Sulpice.

203
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:44,086
Good evening, Sister.

204
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:48,896
I need you to show someone
our church tonight.

205
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:50,733
Of course, Father.

206
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:52,964
But so late?

207
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,206
Wouldn`t tomorrow...?

208
00:17:55,407 --> 00:18:00,140
This is a request from an
important bishop of Opus Dei.

209
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:03,313
lt would be my pleasure.

210
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:30,299
There`s been an accident. A friend.

211
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,500
l have to fly home in the morning.

212
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:33,973
l see.

213
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:38,206
ls there a restroom l could use? l just
wanna splash some water on my face.

214
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:39,577
Yes.

215
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,019
She said it is meaningless.

216
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:47,121
Mathematical joke.

217
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,958
ls it meaningless?

218
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,656
l`ll take another look
when l come back.

219
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,004
l`m sorry. Of course.

220
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,020
Do you have a message
from Saunière?

221
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,354
What are you talking about?

222
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,929
Crazy old man.

223
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:28,725
You have me confused with
someone else.

224
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,697
l was asked to come here
and consult.

225
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,768
No, you are
sous surveillance cachée.

226
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:34,563
Yes, and--

227
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:36,365
What?

228
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:40,477
Bring the suspect to the crime scene
and hope he incriminates himself.

229
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,703
Suspect?

230
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:43,941
Check your jacket pocket.

231
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,547
Just look.

232
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,288
GPS tracking dot.

233
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:55,551
Accurate within two feet
anywhere on the globe.

234
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:59,322
The agent who picked you up
slipped it into your jacket...

235
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,825
...in case you tried to run.

236
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:07,031
We have you on a little leash,
professor.

237
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:18,574
Why would l try to run?
l didn`t do anything.

238
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:22,811
So, what do you think about
the fourth line of teXt...

239
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:25,888
...Fache wiped clean
before you arrived?

240
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,894
He brought you here to force a
confession, Professor Langdon.

241
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:41,467
He`s still in there?
What`s he doing?

242
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:49,611
Fache isn`t even looking
for other suspects, okay?

243
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:51,338
He is sure you`re guilty.

244
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:57,581
When did Saunière contact you?

245
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:58,813
-Today?
-Yes, yes.

246
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:01,083
What time? What time?

247
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:03,124
At 3. Around 3. Three.

248
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:06,024
The gallery alarm was triggered at 8.
You were--

249
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:07,926
-l was giving a lecture.
-At 9.

250
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:12,900
You had the privacy light on
in your hotel room until 8:30, right?

251
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,802
We call Fache ``the Bull.``
Once he starts, he doesn`t stop.

252
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:20,172
He can arrest you and detain you
for months while he builds a case.

253
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:23,746
And by then whatever Saunière
wanted you to tell me will be useless.

254
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,008
Stop it! Just stop!

255
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:28,142
Who are you?

256
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:30,685
What are you talking about?
Tell you what?

257
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:34,254
Maybe who really killed him.

258
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:43,459
The Fibonacci sequence.

259
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:45,830
l believe Saunière wrote it...

260
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,905
...so his investigation would
include cryptographers.

261
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:54,740
That`s quite a leap, isn`t it?

262
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:56,379
No.

263
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:59,310
And the letters.

264
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:00,576
``P.S.``

265
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:02,447
P.S., postscript.

266
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:10,350
``Princess Sophie.``
Yeah. Silly, l know.

267
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:13,463
But l was only a girl
when l lived with him.

268
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,529
Jacques Saunière
was my grandfather.

269
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:30,045
Apparently, it was his dying wish
that we meet.

270
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,045
lf you help me understand why...

271
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:37,915
...l will get you to your embassy,
where we cannot arrest you.

272
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,921
Fache was never gonna let me
just stroll out of here, was he?

273
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:43,958
No.

274
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:48,663
lf we are to get away from here,
we must find another way.

275
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,975
What eXactly do you propose?

276
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:14,321
Saunière was reading his book.

277
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,694
``Blood trail.``

278
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,427
EXcuse me, captain.

279
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:24,659
Crypto called.
They identified the code.

280
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,667
Neveu told us already.

281
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:30,672
l should have fired her on the spot,
barging in like that.

282
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,741
Yes.

283
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:35,504
EXcept they didn`t send Neveu.

284
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:39,109
What?

285
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:42,718
Captain, look at this.

286
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,651
He jumped!

287
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:47,115
Shit.

288
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:52,555
He`s moving again. And fast.

289
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:54,928
He must be in a car.

290
00:23:56,368 --> 00:24:00,532
He`s going south
on Pont du Carrousel.

291
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,543
Bastard.

292
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:37,165
That cop will check
the whole lower floor.

293
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,110
l will only take a moment.

294
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:44,877
Of course.

295
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:55,753
He is much older than l remember.

296
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,907
l hadn`t seen or spoken to him
in a very long time.

297
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:23,977
He phoned my office today.
Several times.

298
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,182
He said it was a matter
of life and death.

299
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:32,060
l thought it was another trick
to get back in touch.

300
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:37,634
lt seems when
he couldn`t speak to me...

301
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:40,761
...he reached out to you.

302
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:49,674
Whatever he needed
so badly to say...

303
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:53,547
...he found neither of us in time.

304
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:22,177
-Wait a minute.
-Professor?

305
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:24,944
Come on.

306
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:26,875
lt can`t be that easy.

307
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:31,083
This is wrong.
Yeah. See? This is wrong.

308
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:36,253
The Fibonacci numbers only
make sense when they`re in order.

309
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:37,928
These are scrambled.

310
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:41,860
lf he was trying to reach out,
maybe he was doing it in code.

311
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:43,932
Would you hold this, please?

312
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:48,198
This phrase is meaningless.

313
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:54,835
Unless you assume these letters
are out of order too.

314
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:56,206
An anagram.

315
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,756
You have eidetic memory?

316
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:13,588
Not quite. But l can pretty much
remember what l see.

317
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,920
Anagram is right.

318
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,883
``O, Draconian devil. Oh, lame saint``
becomes:

319
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:43,720
``Leonardo da Vinci.
The Mona Lisa.``

320
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:47,591
Professor, the Mona Lisa
is right over here.

321
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:58,842
Look at this. He must have
thrown it from the window.

322
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,768
Smart to hit the truck.

323
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:04,704
What, you admire him now?

324
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,410
We`re stupid.
Who did we leave at the museum?

325
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,350
LedouX? Get him on the radio!

326
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,750
Her smile is in
the lower spatial frequencies.

327
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:18,554
The horizon is significantly lower
on the left than it is on the right.

328
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:19,821
Why?

329
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:23,330
Well, see, she appears larger
from the left than on the right.

330
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,595
Historically, the left was female,
the right was male.

331
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:28,906
The sacred feminine.

332
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,634
Why do you say that?

333
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:36,109
Something Saunière said
the first time we came here.

334
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:40,646
There. Blood.

335
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:54,057
Hey.

336
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,428
``So dark the con of man.``

337
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:02,503
No. lt doesn`t say that.

338
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:05,039
ls it another anagram?
Can you break it?

339
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:12,416
Professor, hurry. Hurry!

340
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:17,054
Moon. Sermon. Charms.

341
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:21,214
Demons. Omens. Codes.
Monks. Ranks. Rocks.

342
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,484
Madonna of the Rocks.

343
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:24,352
Da Vinci.

344
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,502
Careful. Careful.

345
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:47,816
This can`t be this. The fleur-de-lis.

346
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:07,201
Stay where you are!

347
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:11,008
Let go of the painting...

348
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:13,006
...and put it on the ground.

349
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:19,173
No. You put your gun down.

350
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:21,409
Now!

351
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:23,280
Or else l will destroy the painting.

352
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:27,454
Hurry up!

353
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,589
Slide your gun to me.

354
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,862
Be careful.

355
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:36,090
l never really liked this painting.

356
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:58,286
Run.

357
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:30,080
lt was Saunière`s.

358
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,657
l remember finding it once
when l was a girl.

359
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:36,755
He`d promised
he`d give it to me one day.

360
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,757
Have you ever heard
those words before, Sophie?

361
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:41,363
``So dark the con of man``?

362
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,158
No. Have you?

363
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:46,804
When you were a child, were you
aware of any secret gatherings?

364
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:50,338
Anything ritualistic in nature?

365
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:53,806
Meetings your grandfather
would`ve wanted kept secret?

366
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:57,448
Was there ever any talk of something
called the Priory of Sion?

367
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:00,584
The what? Why are you
asking these things?

368
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:03,253
The Priory of Sion is a myth.

369
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:07,914
One of the world`s oldest and most
secret societies, with leaders like...

370
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:10,617
...Sir lsaac Newton,
da Vinci himself.

371
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:12,859
The fleur-de-lis is their crest.

372
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:15,589
They`re guardians of a secret
they supposedly refer to...

373
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,961
...as ``the dark con of man.``

374
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,002
But what secret?

375
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:25,840
The Priory of Sion protects
the source of God`s power on earth.

376
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:36,652
l can`t do this by myself.

377
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:40,123
l`m in enough trouble as it is.
That`s my embassy.

378
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:41,383
Please.

379
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:43,082
Even if we could get out of this--

380
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,761
Okay.

381
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:24,432
No, no, no. You`re not gonna make it.
You`re not gonna make it!

382
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:33,407
Well, that was....

383
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:47,420
We won`t last long in this car.

384
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:50,492
Fache doesn`t like to be eluded,
even on a good day.

385
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,458
We need to get out of sight.

386
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:13,178
Christ, give me strength.

387
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:29,722
You are a ghost.

388
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:34,366
Christ, give me strength.

389
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,894
Stealing in a house of God!

390
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:28,252
You are an angel.

391
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:32,985
Christ, give me strength.

392
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:00,610
You have powerful friends.

393
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:04,480
Bishop Aringarosa
has been kind to me.

394
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:09,082
l could not miss this chance
to pray inside the Saint-Sulpice.

395
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:12,429
A pity you couldn`t wait for morning.

396
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,598
The light is not ideal.

397
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:19,596
Tell me, Sister, please,
of the Rose Line.

398
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:25,202
A rose line is any line that goes from
the North to South Poles.

399
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:30,312
Set into the streets of Paris,
1 35 brass markers...

400
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:33,039
...mark the world`s
first prime meridian...

401
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,685
...which passed through
this very church.

402
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:37,717
lt hides beneath the Rose.

403
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,116
l`m sorry?

404
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:41,619
Sister.

405
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:47,627
l do not want to keep you.
l will show myself out.

406
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:51,961
l insist.

407
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,141
May the peace of the Lord
be with you.

408
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:02,444
And with you.

409
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:27,995
Gray Smart Car. Black roof.

410
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:31,936
Corner of Denain Boulevard
at the train station.

411
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,235
How could you let them get away?

412
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:36,345
Why not just shoot the damn painting?
lmbecile!

413
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:39,414
You should put his cigar
out in your hand!

414
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:40,879
Get out of here!

415
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:48,548
They found Neveu`s car
abandoned at the train station.

416
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:54,229
And two tickets to Brussels paid for
with Langdon`s credit card.

417
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:55,931
A decoy, l`m sure.

418
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,567
All the same,
send an officer to the station.

419
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:01,430
Question all the taXi drivers.
l`ll put this on the wire.

420
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:04,368
lnterpol? We`re not sure he`s guilty.

421
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:08,573
l know he`s guilty. Beyond a doubt.

422
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:11,714
Robert Langdon is guilty.

423
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:22,418
This is the Bois de Boulogne?

424
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:25,459
We should be safe in this park
for a few minutes.

425
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:45,477
Your police don`t patrol this park.

426
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:40,834
Stay here.

427
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:43,770
Police.

428
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:46,506
What do you want?

429
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:03,383
Fifty euros for all your stuff.

430
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:07,756
Go and get something to eat.

431
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:29,943
Did it occur to you
that could be dangerous?

432
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:33,351
No. And now we have
a place to think.

433
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:35,553
Any ideas, professor?

434
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,321
You could`ve just handed me
a piece of a UFO from Area 51 .

435
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:44,825
``What`s the neXt step?``

436
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:46,662
With him, it`s always:

437
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:49,965
``Sophie, what`s the neXt step?``

438
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:52,039
Puzzles.

439
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:53,608
Codes.

440
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:55,705
A treasure hunt.

441
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:01,412
To find his killer.

442
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:09,090
Maybe there is something
about this Priory of Sion.

443
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:10,282
l hope not.

444
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:15,328
Any Priory story ends in bloodshed.
They were butchered by the Church.

445
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:18,896
It all started over a thousand
years ago when a French king...

446
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:21,537
...conquered the holy city
of Jerusalem.

447
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:25,038
This crusade, one of the most
massive and sweeping in history...

448
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:28,734
...was actually orchestrated
by a secret brotherhood...

449
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:30,311
...the Priory of Sion...

450
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:34,575
...and their military arm,
the Knights Templar.

451
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:38,079
But the Templars were created
to protect the Holy Land.

452
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:42,282
That was a cover to hide their
true goal, according to this myth.

453
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,957
Supposedly the invasion
was to find an artifact...

454
00:42:46,163 --> 00:42:47,994
...lost since the time of Christ.

455
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:52,328
An artifact, it was said,
the Church would kill to possess.

456
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:55,130
Did they find it,
this buried treasure?

457
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,602
Put it this way:

458
00:42:57,808 --> 00:43:00,709
One day the Templars
simply stopped searching.

459
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:04,369
They quit the Holy Land
and traveled directly to Rome.

460
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,447
Whether they blackmailed
the papacy...

461
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:09,084
...or the Church bought their silence,
no one knows.

462
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:13,655
But it is a fact the papacy
declared these Priory knights...

463
00:43:13,857 --> 00:43:17,486
...these Knights Templar,
of limitless power.

464
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:21,495
By the 1 300s, the Templars
had grown too powerful.

465
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:23,098
Too threatening.

466
00:43:23,467 --> 00:43:25,526
So the Vatican
issued secret orders...

467
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:28,671
...to be opened simultaneously
all across Europe.

468
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:33,433
The Pope had declared the
Knights Templar Satan worshipers...

469
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:38,172
...and said God had charged him with
cleansing the earth of these heretics.

470
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:40,816
The plan went off like clockwork.

471
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:43,987
The Templars
were all but exterminated.

472
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:48,420
The date was October 1 3th, 1 307.
A Friday.

473
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,526
Friday the 1 3th.

474
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:53,787
The Pope sent troops
to claim the Priory`s treasure...

475
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:55,590
...but they found nothing.

476
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:59,030
The few surviving
Knights of the Priory had vanished...

477
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:02,069
...and the search for their
sacred artifact began again.

478
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:06,436
What artifact? l`ve never
heard about any of this.

479
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,134
Yes, you have.

480
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:10,878
Almost everyone on earth has.

481
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:14,384
You just know it as the Holy Grail.

482
00:44:20,024 --> 00:44:24,154
Please, Saunière thought he knew
the location of the Holy Grail?

483
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:26,461
Maybe more than that.

484
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:30,566
This cross and the flower,
this could be very old. But look.

485
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:36,001
This metal here underneath is much
newer, and there`s a modern lD stamp.

486
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:38,071
``HaXo 2 4.``

487
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:43,411
And these dots.
These dots are read by a laser.

488
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:47,311
This is more than a pendant.
This is a key your grandfather left you.

489
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,153
He left us, professor.

490
00:44:51,555 --> 00:44:55,889
And vingt-quatre HaXo,
it`s not an lD stamp.

491
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,425
lt`s a street address.

492
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,858
This is Jacques Saunière.

493
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:08,067
Please leave a message
after the tone.

494
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:11,138
Please, Monsieur Saunière,
pick up the phone.

495
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:12,909
This is Sandrine Bieil.

496
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:15,407
l have called the list.

497
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:17,746
l fear the other guardians are dead.

498
00:45:18,348 --> 00:45:20,248
The lie has been told.

499
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:22,482
The floor panel has been broken.

500
00:45:22,753 --> 00:45:26,154
Please, monsieur, pick up the phone.
l beg you.

501
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:28,586
Job 38, verse 1 1 .

502
00:45:29,993 --> 00:45:31,927
Do you know it, Sister?

503
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,460
Job 38:1 1 .

504
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:39,364
Hitherto shalt thou come...

505
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,932
...but no further.

506
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:43,538
``But no further.``

507
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:49,543
Do you mock me?

508
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:54,743
Where is the keystone?

509
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,315
l do not know.

510
00:45:58,355 --> 00:45:59,481
No.

511
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:04,522
You are a sister of the Church...

512
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:09,898
...and yet you serve them:
the Priory.

513
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:14,093
Jesus had but one true message.
That--

514
00:46:34,324 --> 00:46:36,986
Come, you saints of God.

515
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:40,555
Hasten, angels of the Lord.

516
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:44,061
To receive her soul.

517
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:49,063
And bring her to the sight
of the Almighty.

518
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:57,605
ln the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

519
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:30,540
Welcome, bishop.

520
00:47:33,884 --> 00:47:35,078
May Christ be with you.

521
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:37,253
And also with you.

522
00:47:37,454 --> 00:47:40,082
lt`s been too long, Manuel.

523
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:43,650
l saw your press conference.

524
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,260
Very priestly.

525
00:47:45,462 --> 00:47:46,793
Vultures.

526
00:47:46,997 --> 00:47:50,296
But you need a good cover
to fly into ltaly these days.

527
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:55,365
So how are things in Rome?

528
00:47:56,673 --> 00:47:58,038
We serve at his pleasure.

529
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:02,471
Today is today.

530
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:05,571
But there are many tomorrows.

531
00:48:08,485 --> 00:48:10,180
Vatican cellars.

532
00:48:10,787 --> 00:48:12,948
1 9 76.

533
00:48:13,156 --> 00:48:17,115
Seventy-siX, a year of independence.
How fitting.

534
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:21,929
l thought you`d like it.

535
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,633
l`ll fetch the others.

536
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:46,990
Welcome, bishop.

537
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,587
This council is convened.

538
00:49:01,004 --> 00:49:04,531
Our words shall never
pass these walls.

539
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:13,143
What business, say you?

540
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:17,177
As you know, my request for funds--

541
00:49:17,387 --> 00:49:21,653
Yes, 20 million euro
in untraceable bearer bonds.

542
00:49:21,858 --> 00:49:25,021
A tad more than petty cash.
Wouldn`t you say, bishop?

543
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:28,459
The endeavor is compleX.
Freedom has a high cost.

544
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:30,667
And, of course, you will deliver us.

545
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:33,368
How fortunate we are.

546
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:38,200
l only offer a route to the renewal
of faith for all men.

547
00:49:38,408 --> 00:49:39,670
How humble.

548
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:42,375
Our savior, Bishop Aringarosa.

549
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:44,672
Were we to grant your request...

550
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:48,279
...when would
this mission commence?

551
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,248
-Actually, tonight.
-What?

552
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:52,382
-lt has begun.
-We have not agreed.

553
00:49:52,589 --> 00:49:54,113
How dare you presume to--

554
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,053
l do not presume, l act!

555
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:58,420
The Vatican`s unwillingness
to support us...

556
00:49:58,628 --> 00:50:00,220
...is both impious and cowardly.

557
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:04,560
Blood is being spilled because true
Christian values lie in ruins. No more!

558
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:08,433
This council has forgotten
its very purpose.

559
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:12,301
Tonight...

560
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,743
...the Grail will be destroyed.

561
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:19,882
The Priory`s few remaining members
will be silenced.

562
00:50:27,824 --> 00:50:32,056
l was contacted by a man
who calls himself only ``the Teacher.``

563
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:35,660
He knows a great deal
about this council.

564
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:38,564
And about the Priory.

565
00:50:54,017 --> 00:50:56,542
Two prostitutes identified
Langdon and Neveu...

566
00:50:56,753 --> 00:50:58,948
...getting into a taxi
in the Bois de Boulogne.

567
00:51:13,637 --> 00:51:15,571
Because of your eXpertise?

568
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,207
-l`m sorry?
-About the Priory.

569
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:20,842
Do you think that`s why
Saunière sought you out?

570
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:24,539
l can think of dozens of scholars
who know a lot more about it.

571
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:28,809
Actually, l didn`t think
he liked me very much.

572
00:51:29,486 --> 00:51:32,922
Once made a joke at my eXpense.
Got a big laugh out of it.

573
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:34,454
What was it?

574
00:51:47,704 --> 00:51:49,467
How may l help you?

575
00:51:55,378 --> 00:51:57,642
The door to the right, please.

576
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:11,152
That was quite a performance.

577
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:16,092
The little shit should know better
than to play politics with me.

578
00:52:21,371 --> 00:52:23,669
l know l got in front of you,
old friend.

579
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:27,575
l did what l thought was best.

580
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:36,776
So...

581
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,011
...now what?

582
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:42,750
Now we wait for the Teacher`s call.

583
00:52:55,205 --> 00:52:57,833
Good evening. l am André Vernet,
the night manager.

584
00:52:59,376 --> 00:53:02,607
l take it this is your first visit
to our establishment?

585
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:04,780
Yes.

586
00:53:05,715 --> 00:53:07,012
Understood.

587
00:53:07,784 --> 00:53:10,150
Keys are often passed on
and first-time users...

588
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:13,015
...are sometimes
uncertain of protocol.

589
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:17,851
Keys are essentially
numbered Swiss accounts.

590
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:21,754
Often willed through generations.

591
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:27,135
ls it yours, mademoiselle?

592
00:53:29,272 --> 00:53:32,264
The shortest safety-deposit-boX
lease is 50 years.

593
00:53:33,276 --> 00:53:35,335
And what`s your longest account?

594
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:37,103
Quite a bit longer.

595
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:40,209
Technologies change,
keys are updated.

596
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:44,509
But our accounts date back
to the beginning of banking itself.

597
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:51,086
Once the computer
confirms your key...

598
00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:54,695
...enter your account number
and your boX is retrieved.

599
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:57,565
The room is yours,
as long as you like.

600
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:05,869
What if l lost track
of my account number?

601
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:07,910
How might l recover it?

602
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:12,740
l`m afraid each key is paired
with a 1 0-digit number...

603
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:14,974
...known only to the account bearer.

604
00:54:15,185 --> 00:54:17,244
l hope you manage to remember it.

605
00:54:17,887 --> 00:54:20,515
A single wrong entry
disables the system.

606
00:54:27,464 --> 00:54:28,488
-Ten.
-Ten.

607
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:31,223
Your grandfather`s
Fibonacci sequence.

608
00:54:34,404 --> 00:54:36,770
Scrambled, unscrambled?

609
00:54:37,707 --> 00:54:39,004
Unscrambled.

610
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:41,336
lt`s your key.

611
00:54:46,082 --> 00:54:49,779
Funny, l don`t even like history.

612
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:57,416
l`ve never seen much good come
from looking to the past.

613
00:55:04,901 --> 00:55:06,391
Moment of truth.

614
00:55:51,047 --> 00:55:53,572
My God. l don`t believe this.

615
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,177
A rose.

616
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,854
The rose was a symbol
for the Holy Grail.

617
00:56:04,728 --> 00:56:06,286
Forgive the intrusion.

618
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:10,057
l`m afraid the police arrived
more quickly than l anticipated.

619
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:12,797
You must follow me, please.

620
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:14,367
For your own safety.

621
00:56:14,738 --> 00:56:16,330
You knew they were coming?

622
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:19,269
My guard alerted me to your status
when you arrived.

623
00:56:19,476 --> 00:56:22,343
Yours is one of our oldest
and highest-level accounts.

624
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:24,775
lt includes a safe-passage clause.

625
00:56:24,981 --> 00:56:26,141
Safe passage?

626
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:31,009
lf you would step inside, please.
Time is of the essence.

627
00:56:33,423 --> 00:56:34,685
ln there?

628
00:56:49,873 --> 00:56:51,636
Hey, is there a problem?

629
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:54,469
Good evening, sir. Police.

630
00:56:54,944 --> 00:56:59,005
l just drive from here to Zurich.
Not French, English?

631
00:56:59,382 --> 00:57:00,508
-English?
-Yes.

632
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:04,579
We are looking for two criminals.

633
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:08,656
You came to the right place.
They`re all criminals here.

634
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:12,792
Would you mind opening the hold?

635
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:16,856
Please. You think they trust us,
the wages l get paid?

636
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:18,931
You don`t have keys
to your own truck?

637
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:21,831
lt`s armored.
Keys get sent to the destination.

638
00:57:22,038 --> 00:57:24,097
You mind? l`m on a schedule here.

639
00:57:27,644 --> 00:57:32,047
And do all the drivers wear a RoleX?

640
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:33,607
What?

641
00:57:36,052 --> 00:57:37,576
This piece of shit.

642
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:39,550
Forty euros in Barbès.

643
00:57:39,756 --> 00:57:40,882
Yours for 35.

644
00:57:41,524 --> 00:57:42,491
No, no, no.

645
00:57:42,692 --> 00:57:44,455
-Thirty.
-No. lt`s okay, it`s okay.

646
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:45,889
Come on, 30, eh?

647
00:57:46,095 --> 00:57:47,426
l said, no!

648
00:57:47,997 --> 00:57:49,123
Move along!

649
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:03,637
Now we wait.

650
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:06,441
The Teacher will call and tell me
where to deliver the money.

651
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:10,016
You have put tremendous faith
in this Teacher of yours.

652
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:14,623
Yes, l have. And l have given him
an angel to do his will.

653
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:18,358
For surely there is no better
soldier for God than my Silas.

654
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:22,992
l firmly resolve, with the help of
thy grace, to confess my sins...

655
00:58:37,247 --> 00:58:39,807
...to do penance
and to amend my life.

656
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:41,217
Amen.

657
00:59:01,504 --> 00:59:03,870
l chastise my body.

658
00:59:19,923 --> 00:59:21,515
The Holy Grail.

659
00:59:22,325 --> 00:59:27,160
A magic cup.
The source of God`s power on earth.

660
00:59:27,363 --> 00:59:28,660
lt`s nonsense.

661
00:59:29,632 --> 00:59:31,566
You don`t believe in God.

662
00:59:32,435 --> 00:59:33,561
No.

663
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:39,831
l don`t believe in some magic
from the sky.

664
00:59:40,043 --> 00:59:41,533
Just people.

665
00:59:42,211 --> 00:59:44,771
Sometimes that they can be kind.

666
00:59:45,682 --> 00:59:46,910
And that`s enough?

667
00:59:47,283 --> 00:59:50,616
Well, l think it has to be.
l think it`s all we have.

668
00:59:53,222 --> 00:59:55,782
Are you a God-fearing man,
professor?

669
00:59:56,893 --> 00:59:58,690
l was raised a Catholic.

670
00:59:59,395 --> 01:00:01,955
Well, that`s not really an answer.

671
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:05,767
Professor, are you okay?

672
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:08,528
Go ahead, open it.

673
01:00:09,339 --> 01:00:10,363
Go on.

674
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:18,811
A crypteX.

675
01:00:20,149 --> 01:00:22,640
They are used to keep secrets.

676
01:00:23,419 --> 01:00:25,546
lt`s da Vinci`s design.

677
01:00:26,189 --> 01:00:29,488
You write the information
on a papyrus scroll...

678
01:00:29,692 --> 01:00:34,789
...which is then rolled around
a thin glass vial of vinegar.

679
01:00:34,998 --> 01:00:38,195
lf you force it open, the vial breaks...

680
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:41,063
...vinegar dissolves papyrus...

681
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:45,399
...and your secret is lost forever.

682
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:47,833
The only way
to access the information...

683
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:50,410
...is to spell out the password...

684
01:00:50,613 --> 01:00:54,071
...with these five dials,
each with 26 letters.

685
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:58,681
That`s 1 2 million possibilities.

686
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:02,950
l`ve never met a girl
who knew that much about a crypteX.

687
01:01:04,193 --> 01:01:06,457
Saunière made one for me once.

688
01:01:14,404 --> 01:01:17,601
My grandfather gave me a wagon.

689
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:22,440
This clearly is not the Holy Grail.

690
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:27,509
Come on.

691
01:01:27,784 --> 01:01:29,251
Please, you`re not all right.

692
01:01:32,622 --> 01:01:34,385
May l try something?

693
01:01:34,757 --> 01:01:36,657
l don`t know why it works.

694
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:40,889
My mother used to do it
when l was scared, l think.

695
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:42,459
You think?

696
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:44,358
Yes.

697
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:58,210
Feeling better, Sophie?

698
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:14,860
My parents died in a car crash
with my brother.

699
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:17,163
l was 4.

700
01:02:19,035 --> 01:02:20,400
l`m sorry.

701
01:02:21,771 --> 01:02:23,705
lt was many years ago.

702
01:02:39,355 --> 01:02:40,617
Better?

703
01:02:43,392 --> 01:02:44,359
Yeah.

704
01:02:45,161 --> 01:02:46,287
Okay.

705
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:15,015
Twenty years waiting
for someone to come for that boX...

706
01:03:15,224 --> 01:03:17,749
...and now it`s you two murderers.
Bring it to me.

707
01:03:18,561 --> 01:03:20,256
l don`t know what
you`re talking about.

708
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:23,398
All right! Okay!

709
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:25,089
Right now!

710
01:03:35,578 --> 01:03:36,545
Step back!

711
01:03:40,516 --> 01:03:42,950
No one will lose sleep
over a couple on a killing spree.

712
01:03:46,122 --> 01:03:47,646
Turn around.

713
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:50,257
Turn around!

714
01:03:50,593 --> 01:03:52,288
You too, mademoiselle.

715
01:04:14,884 --> 01:04:16,374
Sophie!

716
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:18,218
Get in the truck!

717
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:20,386
l`ll drive! Hurry!

718
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:01,758
-Better?
-Always, if l got too nervous...

719
01:05:01,964 --> 01:05:05,058
...l had to put my head out
of the window not to be sick.

720
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:08,431
Saunière used to say
l was like a dog.

721
01:05:09,705 --> 01:05:14,039
A cute dog. You know, a little dog.

722
01:05:23,152 --> 01:05:26,644
What happened between you
and your grandfather, Sophie?

723
01:05:29,191 --> 01:05:33,059
l`ve jammed my shoulder,
l`ve been shot at, l`m bleeding.

724
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:34,820
l need to know.

725
01:05:35,031 --> 01:05:38,489
You say he raised you,
but you two don`t talk anymore.

726
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:40,669
You call him by his last name.

727
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:43,497
You say you hate history.

728
01:05:43,706 --> 01:05:45,970
Nobody hates history.
They hate their own histories.

729
01:05:46,175 --> 01:05:48,166
So now you`re a psychologist too?

730
01:05:48,544 --> 01:05:52,742
What if Saunière had started
to groom you for the Priory?

731
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:54,678
What do you mean, groom me?

732
01:05:54,884 --> 01:05:58,183
Your grandfather gave you puzzles
and crypteX as a child.

733
01:05:58,988 --> 01:06:03,220
Say Saunière was hoping one day
you would join him in the Priory.

734
01:06:03,426 --> 01:06:05,519
Still, years later,
when he imagines...

735
01:06:06,362 --> 01:06:09,160
...the Grail is in danger,
he reaches out to you.

736
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:13,392
So you are saying all this is real?
The Priory, the Holy Grail?

737
01:06:13,602 --> 01:06:16,730
We`ve been dragged into a world
of people who think this stuff is real.

738
01:06:16,939 --> 01:06:19,032
-Real enough to kill for.
-Who?

739
01:06:25,281 --> 01:06:27,806
l`m out of my field here.

740
01:06:30,252 --> 01:06:34,916
l do know a Grail historian,
absolutely obsessed with Priory myth.

741
01:06:35,124 --> 01:06:38,252
An Englishman,
lives here in France.

742
01:06:38,594 --> 01:06:40,186
Do you trust this man?

743
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:42,854
l hope you can.

744
01:06:48,971 --> 01:06:50,768
Vernet, André.

745
01:06:52,475 --> 01:06:55,273
lt seems you`re not a driver at all.

746
01:06:57,146 --> 01:07:01,913
Apparently, you lost your tongue
along with your truck.

747
01:07:05,154 --> 01:07:09,318
Aiding and abetting
two murder suspects.

748
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:11,959
That carries jail time.

749
01:07:12,495 --> 01:07:14,258
Speak to my lawyer.

750
01:07:15,931 --> 01:07:22,860
All this confusion, violence,
vanishing property....

751
01:07:23,072 --> 01:07:29,307
lt might get around that your bank is
less than ideal, don`t you think?

752
01:07:31,447 --> 01:07:34,109
You think you`re in pain now,
André Vernet?

753
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:38,509
My cause is worth your life.
Understand?

754
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:44,450
What do you want?

755
01:07:44,794 --> 01:07:50,027
Your truck carries a homing device.
Activate it.

756
01:07:57,973 --> 01:08:00,669
Please wait.
I`ll see if he`s available.

757
01:08:00,876 --> 01:08:02,503
lt`s on the wrong side.

758
01:08:02,711 --> 01:08:05,202
Leigh likes all things to be English,
including his cars.

759
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:08,542
Robert! Do I owe you money?

760
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:12,216
Leigh, my friend...

761
01:08:12,488 --> 01:08:15,753
...care to open up
for an old colleague?

762
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:17,687
-Of course.
-Thank you.

763
01:08:18,027 --> 01:08:20,427
But first, a test of honor.

764
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:22,725
Three questions.

765
01:08:26,035 --> 01:08:27,229
Fire away.

766
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:28,869
Your first:

767
01:08:29,071 --> 01:08:31,733
Shall I serve coffee or tea?

768
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:33,973
Tea, of course.

769
01:08:34,176 --> 01:08:35,234
Excellent.

770
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:37,742
Second: milk or lemon?

771
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:39,805
Milk?

772
01:08:41,183 --> 01:08:43,515
That would depend on the tea.

773
01:08:43,719 --> 01:08:44,686
Correct.

774
01:08:45,688 --> 01:08:49,886
And now the third
and most grave of inquiries:

775
01:08:50,092 --> 01:08:55,394
In which year did a Harvard sculler
outrow an Oxford man at Henley?

776
01:09:02,938 --> 01:09:06,669
Surely such a travesty
has never occurred.

777
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:09,174
Your heart is true.

778
01:09:10,045 --> 01:09:11,410
You may pass.

779
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:15,581
Welcome to Château Villette.

780
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:23,148
Leigh Teabing has spent
his entire life...

781
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:26,192
...studying the Grail.
That thing is one hot tamale.

782
01:09:26,395 --> 01:09:27,794
Sorry?

783
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:31,057
The crypteX, it`s a hot coal.

784
01:09:33,068 --> 01:09:34,262
A hot potato?

785
01:09:35,971 --> 01:09:40,101
So you want to keep our chest
close to our cards, yes?

786
01:09:41,777 --> 01:09:43,642
Very close.

787
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:07,461
The truck`s signal is coming online.

788
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:09,102
lt`s about time.

789
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:14,467
Locked on and tracking, sir.

790
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:20,709
Very good. Tell Collet not to move in
until l get there.

791
01:10:21,283 --> 01:10:25,777
Attention! All of Collet`s units
to Château Villette.

792
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:30,021
The suspects Neveu and Langdon
are likely at that location.

793
01:10:46,542 --> 01:10:47,873
Aringarosa.

794
01:10:58,821 --> 01:11:01,847
l still don`t know why
he put you into this...

795
01:11:02,558 --> 01:11:04,458
...and l`m sorry.

796
01:11:09,565 --> 01:11:10,759
But...

797
01:11:11,567 --> 01:11:13,398
...l`m also very glad.

798
01:11:31,654 --> 01:11:34,316
You are requested
to make yourself at home.

799
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:43,791
Robert!

800
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:47,460
And you travel with a maiden,
it seems.

801
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:50,901
Sir Leigh Teabing,
may l present Miss Sophie Neveu.

802
01:11:51,106 --> 01:11:53,233
Sophie, Sir Leigh Teabing.

803
01:11:53,442 --> 01:11:57,242
lt`s an honor to welcome you...

804
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:59,939
...even though it`s late.

805
01:12:00,249 --> 01:12:04,083
Thank you for having us.
l realize it`s quite late.

806
01:12:05,354 --> 01:12:08,346
So late, mademoiselle,
it`s almost early.

807
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:12,620
What a lovely smile you have.

808
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:15,697
Earl Grey?

809
01:12:16,665 --> 01:12:17,723
Lemon.

810
01:12:18,467 --> 01:12:19,593
Correct.

811
01:12:40,322 --> 01:12:42,517
Château Villette. Yes.

812
01:12:48,664 --> 01:12:50,359
-No.
-Oh, you must.

813
01:12:50,566 --> 01:12:53,296
Remy is from Lyons,
but nevertheless...

814
01:12:53,502 --> 01:12:54,969
...he is fantastic with sauces.

815
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:57,365
-Thank you.
-No, l can`t.

816
01:13:02,211 --> 01:13:04,270
A dramatic late-night arrival.

817
01:13:05,647 --> 01:13:08,047
Mention of life and death.

818
01:13:09,084 --> 01:13:11,712
What can an old cripple
do for you, Robert?

819
01:13:12,688 --> 01:13:16,385
We wanna talk about
the Priory of Sion.

820
01:13:16,825 --> 01:13:18,053
The keepers?

821
01:13:18,994 --> 01:13:20,325
The secret war?

822
01:13:20,529 --> 01:13:22,520
Sorry for all the mystery.

823
01:13:23,265 --> 01:13:26,257
Leigh, l`m into something here
that l cannot understand.

824
01:13:26,702 --> 01:13:27,794
You?

825
01:13:28,637 --> 01:13:32,004
-Really?
-Not without your help.

826
01:13:32,441 --> 01:13:35,501
Playing to my vanity, Robert.
You should be ashamed.

827
01:13:35,711 --> 01:13:36,905
Not if it works.

828
01:13:39,515 --> 01:13:41,676
There are always four:

829
01:13:42,484 --> 01:13:45,612
The Grand Master
and the three sénéchaux...

830
01:13:45,821 --> 01:13:49,222
...make up the primary
guardians of the Grail.

831
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:52,923
Thank you, Remy.
That`ll be all for now.

832
01:13:59,701 --> 01:14:03,034
The Priory`s members
span our very globe itself.

833
01:14:03,238 --> 01:14:07,675
Philippe de Chérisey
eXposed that as a hoaX in 1 967.

834
01:14:07,876 --> 01:14:09,810
And that is what
they want you to believe.

835
01:14:10,746 --> 01:14:13,544
The Priory is charged
with a single task:

836
01:14:13,749 --> 01:14:17,082
To protect the greatest secret
in modern history.

837
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:19,777
The source of God`s power
on earth.

838
01:14:19,988 --> 01:14:21,580
No, that`s a common
misunderstanding.

839
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:26,727
The Priory protects the source
of the Church`s power on earth:

840
01:14:27,429 --> 01:14:28,726
The Holy Grail.

841
01:14:29,264 --> 01:14:30,891
l don`t understand.

842
01:14:31,099 --> 01:14:35,229
What power? Some magic dishes?

843
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:40,067
Robert. Has he been telling you
that the Holy Grail is a cup?

844
01:14:42,711 --> 01:14:44,474
To understand the Holy Grail,
my dear...

845
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:47,979
...you must first understand
the Holy Bible.

846
01:15:03,899 --> 01:15:07,733
The Good Book did not arrive
by facsimile from heaven.

847
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:12,964
The Bible as we know it
was finally presided over by one man:

848
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:14,904
The pagan emperor Constantine.

849
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:17,471
l thought Constantine
was a Christian.

850
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:20,614
Oh, hardly, no.
He was a lifelong pagan...

851
01:15:20,816 --> 01:15:23,444
...who was baptized
on his deathbed.

852
01:15:23,652 --> 01:15:26,985
Constantine was Rome`s
supreme holy man.

853
01:15:27,322 --> 01:15:28,812
From time immemorial...

854
01:15:29,024 --> 01:15:33,484
...his people had worshiped a balance
between nature`s male deities...

855
01:15:33,695 --> 01:15:37,187
...and the goddess,
or sacred feminine.

856
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,527
But a growing religious turmoil
was gripping Rome.

857
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:44,069
Three centuries earlier...

858
01:15:44,273 --> 01:15:47,242
...a young Jew named Jesus
had come along...

859
01:15:47,442 --> 01:15:49,740
...preaching love and a single God.

860
01:15:49,945 --> 01:15:53,073
Centuries after his crucifiXion...

861
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:56,313
... Christ`s followers
had grown exponentially...

862
01:15:56,518 --> 01:15:59,078
...and had started a religious war
against the pagans.

863
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:07,560
Or did the pagans commence war
against the Christians?

864
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:11,461
Leigh, we can`t be sure who began
the atrocities in that period.

865
01:16:11,667 --> 01:16:14,602
We can at least agree that the
conflict grew to such proportions...

866
01:16:14,803 --> 01:16:17,363
...that it threatened
to tear Rome in two.

867
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:20,838
So Constantine may have been
a lifelong pagan...

868
01:16:21,043 --> 01:16:22,874
...but he was also a pragmatist.

869
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:25,205
And in 325 anno Domini...

870
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:30,477
...he decided to unify Rome under
a single religion, Christianity.

871
01:16:30,686 --> 01:16:34,884
Christianity was on the rise.
He didn`t want his empire torn apart.

872
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:38,321
And to strengthen this new
Christian tradition...

873
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:40,791
...Constantine held
a famous ecumenical gathering...

874
01:16:40,996 --> 01:16:43,829
...known as the Council of Nicaea.

875
01:16:44,032 --> 01:16:45,499
And at this council...

876
01:16:45,701 --> 01:16:50,604
...the many sects of Christianity
debated and voted on, well...

877
01:16:50,806 --> 01:16:54,708
...everything, from the acceptance
and rejection of specific gospels...

878
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:56,434
...to the date for Easter...

879
01:16:56,645 --> 01:16:59,705
...to the administering
of the sacraments, and of course...

880
01:16:59,915 --> 01:17:01,883
...the immortality of Jesus.

881
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:03,679
l don`t follow.

882
01:17:04,119 --> 01:17:06,713
Well, ma chère,
until that moment in history...

883
01:17:07,322 --> 01:17:11,918
...Jesus was viewed by many of his
followers as a mighty prophet...

884
01:17:12,127 --> 01:17:15,961
...as a great and powerful man,
but a man nevertheless.

885
01:17:17,165 --> 01:17:18,996
A mortal man.

886
01:17:19,401 --> 01:17:22,495
Some Christians held
that Jesus was mortal.

887
01:17:22,704 --> 01:17:25,434
Some Christians believed
he was divine.

888
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:26,903
Not the Son of God?

889
01:17:27,109 --> 01:17:29,509
Not even his nephew twice removed.

890
01:17:29,711 --> 01:17:33,579
Hold on, you`re saying
Jesus` divinity came from a vote.

891
01:17:33,949 --> 01:17:36,816
Well, remember, in those days,
gods were everywhere.

892
01:17:37,219 --> 01:17:41,383
By infusing Jesus the man
with the divine magic...

893
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:45,082
...by making him capable
of earthly miracles...

894
01:17:45,293 --> 01:17:49,389
...as well as his own resurrection,
Constantine turned him into a god...

895
01:17:49,598 --> 01:17:51,793
...but within the human world.

896
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,367
And he basically knocked the more
distant gods out of the game.

897
01:17:55,570 --> 01:17:59,028
Constantine did not create
Jesus` divinity.

898
01:17:59,241 --> 01:18:03,200
He simply sanctioned
an already widely held idea.

899
01:18:03,412 --> 01:18:05,039
-Semantics.
-No, it`s not semantics.

900
01:18:05,247 --> 01:18:08,239
You`re interpreting facts
to support your own conclusions.

901
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:13,217
Fact: For many Christians, Jesus was
mortal one day and divine the neXt.

902
01:18:13,422 --> 01:18:15,447
For some Christians,
his divinity was enhanced.

903
01:18:15,657 --> 01:18:18,125
Absurd. There was a formal
announcement of his promotion.

904
01:18:18,326 --> 01:18:20,294
They couldn`t even agree
on the Nicene Creed!

905
01:18:20,495 --> 01:18:23,896
EXcuse me.
``Who is God, who is man?``

906
01:18:28,270 --> 01:18:31,137
How many have been murdered
over this question?

907
01:18:31,973 --> 01:18:34,908
As long as there has been
a one true God...

908
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:37,271
...there has been killing
in his name.

909
01:18:45,854 --> 01:18:48,448
Now let me show you the Grail.

910
01:18:56,631 --> 01:18:59,691
This used to be the ballroom.

911
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:01,960
l have little occasion to dance
these days.

912
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:05,233
l trust you recognize
The Last Supper...

913
01:19:05,807 --> 01:19:09,800
...the great fresco by
Leonardo da Vinci.

914
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:14,808
Now, my dear,
if you would close your eyes.

915
01:19:15,016 --> 01:19:17,246
Oh, Leigh, save us the parlor tricks.

916
01:19:17,452 --> 01:19:19,784
You asked for my help, l recall.

917
01:19:19,988 --> 01:19:22,616
Allow an old man his indulgences.

918
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:30,329
Now, mademoiselle,
where is Jesus sitting?

919
01:19:30,932 --> 01:19:32,627
-ln the middle.
-Good.

920
01:19:32,834 --> 01:19:35,667
He and his disciples
are breaking bread.

921
01:19:35,871 --> 01:19:38,271
And what drink?

922
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:40,505
Wine. They drank wine.

923
01:19:40,709 --> 01:19:43,007
Splendid. And one final question:

924
01:19:43,211 --> 01:19:46,237
How many wineglasses
are there on the table?

925
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:49,550
One? The Holy Grail?

926
01:19:49,751 --> 01:19:50,718
Open your eyes.

927
01:19:53,688 --> 01:19:55,315
No single cup.

928
01:19:55,891 --> 01:19:57,119
No chalice.

929
01:19:57,325 --> 01:20:00,055
Well, that`s a bit strange, isn`t it?

930
01:20:00,262 --> 01:20:03,390
Considering both the Bible
and standard Grail legend...

931
01:20:03,598 --> 01:20:07,864
...celebrate this moment as the
definitive arrival of the Holy Grail.

932
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:13,164
Now, Robert,
you could be of help to us.

933
01:20:13,375 --> 01:20:17,277
lf you`d be so kind as to show us the
symbols for man and woman, please.

934
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:21,176
No balloon animals.
l can make a great duck.

935
01:20:24,219 --> 01:20:28,349
This is the original icon for male.
lt`s a rudimentary phallus.

936
01:20:28,557 --> 01:20:30,684
-Quite to the point.
-Yes, indeed.

937
01:20:30,892 --> 01:20:32,951
This is known as the blade.

938
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:35,026
lt represents aggression
and manhood.

939
01:20:35,230 --> 01:20:37,994
lt`s a symbol still used today
in modern military uniforms.

940
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:42,227
Yes, the more penises you have, the
higher your rank. Boys will be boys.

941
01:20:42,437 --> 01:20:46,737
Now, as you would imagine, the
female symbol is its eXact opposite.

942
01:20:46,942 --> 01:20:48,375
This is called the chalice.

943
01:20:48,577 --> 01:20:53,378
And the chalice resembles a cup
or vessel or, more importantly...

944
01:20:53,582 --> 01:20:55,743
...the shape of a woman`s womb.

945
01:20:56,952 --> 01:20:59,921
No, the Grail has never been a cup.

946
01:21:00,121 --> 01:21:05,081
lt is quite literally this ancient
symbol of womanhood.

947
01:21:06,228 --> 01:21:11,359
And in this case, a woman who
carried a secret so powerful...

948
01:21:11,566 --> 01:21:15,866
...that if revealed, it would devastate
the very foundations of Christianity.

949
01:21:16,071 --> 01:21:17,333
Wait, please.

950
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:22,101
You`re saying the Holy Grail
is a person? A woman?

951
01:21:22,911 --> 01:21:26,870
And it turns out, she makes
an appearance right there.

952
01:21:27,482 --> 01:21:29,109
But they are all men.

953
01:21:29,317 --> 01:21:30,409
Are they?

954
01:21:30,652 --> 01:21:33,052
What about that figure
on the right hand of our Lord...

955
01:21:33,255 --> 01:21:35,951
...seated in the place of honor?

956
01:21:36,791 --> 01:21:38,622
Flowing red hair.

957
01:21:39,761 --> 01:21:42,025
Folded feminine hands.

958
01:21:43,231 --> 01:21:45,631
Hint of a bosom. No?

959
01:21:51,139 --> 01:21:54,506
lt`s called scotoma.
The mind sees what it chooses to see.

960
01:21:54,843 --> 01:21:56,208
Who is she?

961
01:21:57,512 --> 01:21:59,377
My dear, that`s Mary Magdalene.

962
01:21:59,781 --> 01:22:00,805
The prostitute?

963
01:22:01,783 --> 01:22:03,250
She was no such thing.

964
01:22:03,652 --> 01:22:08,248
Smeared by the Church
in 591 anno Domini, poor dear.

965
01:22:10,692 --> 01:22:13,490
Mary Magdalene was Jesus` wife.

966
01:22:20,535 --> 01:22:22,503
This is an old wives` tale.

967
01:22:22,704 --> 01:22:24,137
The original one, in fact.

968
01:22:24,339 --> 01:22:26,432
There`s virtually no empirical proof.

969
01:22:26,641 --> 01:22:29,838
He knows as well as l do
there`s much evidence to support it.

970
01:22:30,045 --> 01:22:31,706
Theories. There are theories.

971
01:22:31,913 --> 01:22:35,041
Notice how Jesus and Mary
are clothed.

972
01:22:36,484 --> 01:22:38,509
Mirror images of each other.

973
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:41,188
The mind sees
what it chooses to see.

974
01:22:41,389 --> 01:22:45,826
And venturing into the even more
bizarre, notice how Jesus and Mary...

975
01:22:46,027 --> 01:22:49,519
...appear to be joined at the hip and
are leaning away from each other...

976
01:22:49,731 --> 01:22:54,293
...as if to create a shape in the
negative space between them.

977
01:22:55,303 --> 01:22:58,636
Leonardo gives us the chalice.

978
01:23:01,176 --> 01:23:03,736
Yes. Oh, and Robert,
notice what happens...

979
01:23:03,945 --> 01:23:07,108
...when these two figures
change position.

980
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:11,248
Just because da Vinci painted it
doesn`t make it true.

981
01:23:11,453 --> 01:23:13,353
No. But history...

982
01:23:13,755 --> 01:23:15,552
...she does make it true.

983
01:23:15,757 --> 01:23:18,988
Now, listen to this. lt`s from
the Gospel according to Philip.

984
01:23:19,194 --> 01:23:20,161
Philip?

985
01:23:20,362 --> 01:23:23,229
Yes, it was rejected
at the Council of Nicaea...

986
01:23:23,431 --> 01:23:25,422
...along with any other gospels
that made...

987
01:23:25,633 --> 01:23:28,124
...Jesus appear human
and not divine.

988
01:23:28,336 --> 01:23:33,239
``And the companion of the Savior
is Mary Magdalene.

989
01:23:33,608 --> 01:23:37,339
Christ loved her more
than all the disciples...

990
01:23:37,545 --> 01:23:39,410
...and used to kiss her on the--``

991
01:23:39,614 --> 01:23:41,445
But this says nothing of marriage.

992
01:23:41,649 --> 01:23:44,413
Well, actually....

993
01:23:44,619 --> 01:23:45,586
Robert.

994
01:23:46,221 --> 01:23:50,851
Actually, in those days, the word
``companion`` literally meant ``spouse.``

995
01:23:51,059 --> 01:23:55,496
And this is from the Gospel
of Mary Magdalene herself.

996
01:23:55,697 --> 01:23:58,359
-She wrote a gospel?
-She may have.

997
01:23:58,566 --> 01:24:01,501
-Robert, will you fight fair?
-She may have.

998
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:05,662
``And Peter said,
`Did he prefer her to us?`

999
01:24:06,641 --> 01:24:07,903
And Levi answered:

1000
01:24:08,109 --> 01:24:12,205
`Peter, l see you contending
against a woman like an adversary.

1001
01:24:12,414 --> 01:24:16,874
lf the Savior made her worthy,
who are you, indeed, to reject her?```

1002
01:24:17,085 --> 01:24:21,545
Yes. And then, my dear, Jesus
goes on to tell Mary Magdalene...

1003
01:24:21,756 --> 01:24:25,590
...that it`s up to her
to continue his Church.

1004
01:24:26,694 --> 01:24:29,390
Mary Magdalene, not Peter.

1005
01:24:30,198 --> 01:24:33,998
The Church was supposed
to be carried on by a woman.

1006
01:24:34,469 --> 01:24:39,168
Few realize that Mary was descended
from kings, just as her husband was.

1007
01:24:39,774 --> 01:24:44,973
Now, my dear, the word
in French for Holy Grail.

1008
01:24:46,448 --> 01:24:49,576
From the Middle English
``Sangreal``...

1009
01:24:49,784 --> 01:24:52,344
...of the original Arthurian legend.

1010
01:24:52,554 --> 01:24:57,685
Now, as two words.
Can you translate for our friend?

1011
01:24:59,394 --> 01:25:02,852
Sang real, it means ``royal blood.``

1012
01:25:03,598 --> 01:25:07,796
When the legend speaks of the
chalice that held the blood of Christ...

1013
01:25:08,369 --> 01:25:13,671
...it speaks in fact of the female womb
that carried Jesus` royal bloodline.

1014
01:25:14,676 --> 01:25:17,509
But how could Christ
have a bloodline, unless--?

1015
01:25:17,712 --> 01:25:20,545
Mary was pregnant
at the time of the CrucifiXion.

1016
01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:33,458
For her own safety and for that
of Christ`s unborn child...

1017
01:25:33,661 --> 01:25:36,721
...she fled the Holy Land
and came to France.

1018
01:25:36,931 --> 01:25:42,028
And here, it is said,
she gave birth to a daughter, Sarah.

1019
01:25:43,204 --> 01:25:45,570
They know the child`s name.

1020
01:25:46,541 --> 01:25:48,406
-A little girl.
-Yes.

1021
01:25:48,610 --> 01:25:50,703
lf that were true,
it`s adding insult to injury.

1022
01:25:50,912 --> 01:25:51,970
Why?

1023
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:55,809
The pagans found transcendence
through the joining of male to female.

1024
01:25:56,017 --> 01:25:57,712
People found God through seX?

1025
01:25:57,919 --> 01:26:00,752
In paganism, women were worshiped
as a route to heaven...

1026
01:26:00,955 --> 01:26:03,788
...but the modern Church
has a monopoly on that...

1027
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:06,222
...in salvation through Jesus Christ.

1028
01:26:06,427 --> 01:26:09,157
And he who keeps the keys to heaven
rules the world.

1029
01:26:09,364 --> 01:26:12,527
Women, then, are a huge threat
to the Church.

1030
01:26:12,734 --> 01:26:14,565
The Catholic Inquisition
soon publishes...

1031
01:26:14,769 --> 01:26:18,068
...what may be the most
blood-soaked book in human history.

1032
01:26:18,273 --> 01:26:20,673
The Malleus Maleficarum.

1033
01:26:21,776 --> 01:26:23,403
The Witches` Hammer.

1034
01:26:23,745 --> 01:26:27,476
lt instructed the clergy on how
to locate, torture and kill...

1035
01:26:27,682 --> 01:26:29,912
...all freethinking women.

1036
01:26:33,087 --> 01:26:35,282
ln three centuries of witch hunts...

1037
01:26:35,723 --> 01:26:39,420
...50,000 women are captured,
burned alive at the stake.

1038
01:26:39,627 --> 01:26:42,255
Oh, at least that.
Some say millions.

1039
01:26:42,864 --> 01:26:44,559
lmagine, then, Robert...

1040
01:26:45,066 --> 01:26:48,934
...that Christ`s throne
might live on in a female child.

1041
01:26:49,938 --> 01:26:52,930
You asked what would
be worth killing for.

1042
01:26:53,541 --> 01:26:57,102
Witness the greatest cover-up
in human history.

1043
01:26:57,912 --> 01:27:00,142
This is the secret
that the Priory of Sion...

1044
01:27:00,348 --> 01:27:02,748
...has defended
for over 20 centuries.

1045
01:27:02,951 --> 01:27:06,114
They are the guardians
of the royal bloodline.

1046
01:27:06,654 --> 01:27:10,112
The keepers of the proof
of our true past.

1047
01:27:10,325 --> 01:27:14,785
They are the protectors of the living
descendants of Jesus Christ...

1048
01:27:16,464 --> 01:27:18,193
...and Mary Magdalene.

1049
01:27:27,976 --> 01:27:29,204
Sir Leigh?

1050
01:27:30,011 --> 01:27:33,310
Sometimes l wonder
who is serving whom.

1051
01:27:34,015 --> 01:27:37,041
His sauces are not that fantastic.

1052
01:27:39,454 --> 01:27:40,921
Yes, can I help you?

1053
01:27:41,122 --> 01:27:43,147
Yes. They`re on the news now.

1054
01:27:46,194 --> 01:27:49,493
Living descendants? ls it possible?

1055
01:27:49,697 --> 01:27:51,324
lt`s not impossible.

1056
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:56,127
You have not been honest with me.
Your pictures are on the television.

1057
01:27:56,337 --> 01:27:58,237
You are wanted for four murders!

1058
01:27:58,673 --> 01:28:00,937
That`s why Vernet said
``killing spree.``

1059
01:28:01,142 --> 01:28:04,578
You come into my home,
playing on my passions for the Grail.

1060
01:28:04,779 --> 01:28:07,247
-That`s why he needed you.
-You will leave my house!

1061
01:28:07,448 --> 01:28:09,439
-Leigh, listen!
-No, l`m calling the police.

1062
01:28:09,651 --> 01:28:11,983
Jacques Saunière
was her grandfather.

1063
01:28:14,856 --> 01:28:16,483
You`re the obsessive Priory scholar.

1064
01:28:16,691 --> 01:28:18,921
You still keep lists
of who might be in the Priory?

1065
01:28:20,128 --> 01:28:22,961
l`ll bet Jacques Saunière
was on one of those lists.

1066
01:28:24,899 --> 01:28:27,390
He was on your list of who could
be Grand Master, wasn`t he?

1067
01:28:27,735 --> 01:28:30,295
-What?
-l`ll bet he was right at the top.

1068
01:28:30,505 --> 01:28:35,670
Consider: Four men murdered?
The same number as the guardians.

1069
01:28:35,877 --> 01:28:39,142
What if the Priory was compromised,
the other sénéchaux dead?

1070
01:28:39,347 --> 01:28:41,440
What if you yourself were dying,
a Grand Master?

1071
01:28:42,083 --> 01:28:45,541
You`d have to pass the secret on
to someone you could trust.

1072
01:28:45,753 --> 01:28:47,448
Someone outside the society.

1073
01:28:47,655 --> 01:28:52,888
Maybe someone whose training
you had begun but never finished.

1074
01:28:55,229 --> 01:28:57,720
Robert, your ruse is pathetic.

1075
01:28:58,866 --> 01:29:00,231
Not really.

1076
01:29:01,803 --> 01:29:04,033
No, that`s impossible.

1077
01:29:07,175 --> 01:29:08,802
Can that really--?

1078
01:29:11,212 --> 01:29:12,509
ls it the keystone?

1079
01:29:15,883 --> 01:29:18,215
l`ll even show it to you, Leigh.

1080
01:29:18,586 --> 01:29:20,747
Will you just tell us
what the hell it`s for?

1081
01:29:38,706 --> 01:29:40,367
Fache says to wait, so l wait.

1082
01:29:40,641 --> 01:29:44,702
What`s Fache thinking?
The truck is here. They`re inside.

1083
01:29:53,488 --> 01:29:54,614
Yes.

1084
01:29:54,822 --> 01:29:57,620
As the legend foretold:

1085
01:29:59,427 --> 01:30:01,588
``lt hides beneath the Rose.``

1086
01:30:01,796 --> 01:30:03,388
Oh, my.

1087
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:11,771
Leigh.

1088
01:30:15,176 --> 01:30:16,643
Leigh?

1089
01:30:17,612 --> 01:30:18,579
Please.

1090
01:30:18,780 --> 01:30:20,771
l`m sorry. Yes, of course.

1091
01:30:23,184 --> 01:30:25,209
lnside the keystone...

1092
01:30:26,587 --> 01:30:28,077
...there`ll be a map.

1093
01:30:28,289 --> 01:30:31,087
A map that will lead us
to the Holy Grail.

1094
01:30:35,029 --> 01:30:37,964
To be trained by
the Grand Master himself.

1095
01:30:38,433 --> 01:30:42,267
Did he pass down the fleur-de-lis?
ls that how you found this?

1096
01:30:44,806 --> 01:30:47,673
And he must have sung you
the riddle songs.

1097
01:30:47,875 --> 01:30:49,399
l know some of them.

1098
01:30:58,686 --> 01:31:00,517
Can you keep secrets?

1099
01:31:02,123 --> 01:31:04,990
Can you know a thing
and never say it again?

1100
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:07,118
And codes?

1101
01:31:08,396 --> 01:31:12,389
l imagine they lie down
for you like lovers.

1102
01:31:15,403 --> 01:31:20,306
A sénéchal. A guardian of the Grail
right here in my own home.

1103
01:31:20,508 --> 01:31:23,375
Tell him, please.
l don`t know any of this.

1104
01:31:23,578 --> 01:31:26,445
Leigh, it`s not that simple.
She doesn`t rem--

1105
01:31:28,015 --> 01:31:29,243
Robert!

1106
01:31:34,589 --> 01:31:35,954
Do not move, woman.

1107
01:31:40,294 --> 01:31:41,261
Cripple.

1108
01:31:43,598 --> 01:31:45,623
Put the boX on the table.

1109
01:31:46,334 --> 01:31:48,063
What, this trifle?

1110
01:31:48,269 --> 01:31:52,228
Well, perhaps we can make
a financial arrangement.

1111
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:55,466
Put the keystone on the table.

1112
01:31:56,444 --> 01:31:58,071
You will not succeed.

1113
01:32:00,381 --> 01:32:03,544
Only the worthy
can unlock the stone.

1114
01:32:32,947 --> 01:32:35,313
Rip the gate down.

1115
01:32:38,819 --> 01:32:40,514
Well, well, my dear.

1116
01:32:44,692 --> 01:32:46,023
Sit down.

1117
01:32:46,227 --> 01:32:47,626
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, yeah.

1118
01:32:47,828 --> 01:32:49,955
-Are you?
-Yeah.

1119
01:32:50,164 --> 01:32:52,496
Yes, well, make yourself useful,
you French fool.

1120
01:32:52,700 --> 01:32:54,861
Get something
to restrain this monster.

1121
01:32:59,874 --> 01:33:01,466
Above the joint.

1122
01:33:02,343 --> 01:33:06,905
Fortunately,
a dragon most easy to slay.

1123
01:33:07,114 --> 01:33:08,513
He`s wearing a cilice.

1124
01:33:09,317 --> 01:33:11,512
-A what?
-Well, look.

1125
01:33:14,021 --> 01:33:16,489
lnflicts pain so he can suffer
as Christ suffered.

1126
01:33:20,027 --> 01:33:22,757
Not so common these days.

1127
01:33:23,197 --> 01:33:25,097
Opus Dei.

1128
01:33:25,299 --> 01:33:27,767
Remy, take care of this.

1129
01:33:32,073 --> 01:33:33,563
Fache is Opus Dei.

1130
01:33:34,842 --> 01:33:37,811
The policeman who`s chasing us.
He wears the cross in the world.

1131
01:33:38,012 --> 01:33:39,639
Robert.

1132
01:33:41,983 --> 01:33:45,248
Well, l must say,
you two are anything but dull.

1133
01:33:46,587 --> 01:33:47,554
Leigh?

1134
01:33:49,724 --> 01:33:51,658
You want what`s in this boX?

1135
01:33:52,793 --> 01:33:54,522
We need a way out of here.

1136
01:33:54,729 --> 01:33:56,720
Well, actually...

1137
01:33:57,832 --> 01:33:59,527
...l do have a plane.

1138
01:34:10,077 --> 01:34:11,908
-Robert! Where do we go?
-Come along.

1139
01:34:12,113 --> 01:34:13,944
-In here. Come in.
-Over here.

1140
01:34:14,148 --> 01:34:16,616
Get the door. Hurry.

1141
01:34:18,686 --> 01:34:20,586
Over here. Over here. Sophie.

1142
01:34:20,788 --> 01:34:22,050
Watch out!

1143
01:34:23,424 --> 01:34:25,016
Be careful.

1144
01:34:25,393 --> 01:34:27,088
Come, Rem--

1145
01:34:34,235 --> 01:34:35,566
Shit.

1146
01:34:38,606 --> 01:34:39,630
Easy.

1147
01:35:02,663 --> 01:35:03,630
Jesus!

1148
01:35:03,831 --> 01:35:04,798
Apropos.

1149
01:35:07,668 --> 01:35:09,533
l can`t imagine
what your complaint is.

1150
01:35:09,737 --> 01:35:12,729
l`d be within my rights to shoot you
and let you rot in my woods!

1151
01:35:12,940 --> 01:35:15,306
Put that away. We might need him.

1152
01:35:15,943 --> 01:35:17,069
Better.

1153
01:35:24,051 --> 01:35:25,678
Opus Dei.

1154
01:35:26,654 --> 01:35:29,145
-What is it?
-A conservative Catholic sect.

1155
01:35:29,356 --> 01:35:31,221
Opus Dei is a prelature
to the Vatican.

1156
01:35:31,425 --> 01:35:34,758
You`re saying the Vatican
is killing people for this boX?

1157
01:35:34,962 --> 01:35:36,896
No, no, no. Not the Vatican...

1158
01:35:37,098 --> 01:35:39,589
...and not Opus Dei,
but we are in the middle of a war.

1159
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:42,234
And one that has been
going on forever.

1160
01:35:42,436 --> 01:35:44,666
On the one side stands the Priory...

1161
01:35:44,872 --> 01:35:47,500
...and on the other
an ancient group of despots...

1162
01:35:47,708 --> 01:35:49,972
...with members hidden
in high-ranking positions...

1163
01:35:50,177 --> 01:35:51,940
...throughout the Church.

1164
01:35:52,146 --> 01:35:56,776
And this Council of Shadows tries
to destroy proof of the bloodline.

1165
01:35:56,984 --> 01:35:59,646
And that throughout history,
they seek out and kill...

1166
01:35:59,854 --> 01:36:01,788
...the living descendants
of Jesus Christ.

1167
01:36:01,989 --> 01:36:03,650
-That`s insane.
-ls it?

1168
01:36:03,891 --> 01:36:06,451
How many atrocities and scandals
has the Catholic Church...

1169
01:36:06,660 --> 01:36:08,753
...rationalized in its time?
And what happens...

1170
01:36:08,963 --> 01:36:11,727
...if some persuasive scientific
evidence emerges that shows...

1171
01:36:11,932 --> 01:36:14,992
...that the Church`s version of Christ
is inaccurate?

1172
01:36:16,704 --> 01:36:18,001
What if the world discovers...

1173
01:36:18,205 --> 01:36:20,935
...that the greatest story ever told
is actually a lie?

1174
01:36:21,142 --> 01:36:24,805
The Vatican faces a crisis of faith
unprecedented.

1175
01:36:25,546 --> 01:36:28,174
l`ve got a signal now, sir.
lt`s ringing.

1176
01:36:30,351 --> 01:36:35,084
Roger, look, l`m so sorry. l`ve got
tired of the weather here in France...

1177
01:36:35,489 --> 01:36:38,424
...and could you make
the plane ready for...

1178
01:36:40,361 --> 01:36:41,521
...Zurich.

1179
01:36:42,096 --> 01:36:43,563
Yes. No, we love Zurich.

1180
01:36:51,539 --> 01:36:54,064
What the hell do you mean,
you lost them? Collet.

1181
01:36:56,210 --> 01:36:57,643
You`re the one who lost them.

1182
01:36:58,045 --> 01:36:59,535
You control every step
of this investigation.

1183
01:36:59,747 --> 01:37:02,147
You don`t let anybody breathe.

1184
01:37:02,683 --> 01:37:05,345
You`re acting like
you lost your mind.

1185
01:37:08,756 --> 01:37:11,589
What is it with these two birds?

1186
01:37:15,229 --> 01:37:18,062
lnterpol just registered a new
flight plan from Le Bourget.

1187
01:37:18,966 --> 01:37:22,197
Stay out of my way on this, Collet.

1188
01:37:50,197 --> 01:37:52,062
Did you kill Jacques Saunière?

1189
01:37:55,469 --> 01:37:57,494
Did you kill Jacques Saunière?

1190
01:37:58,472 --> 01:38:00,269
l am the messenger of God.

1191
01:38:04,144 --> 01:38:06,305
Did you kill my grandfather?

1192
01:38:09,450 --> 01:38:11,111
l am the messenger--

1193
01:38:11,585 --> 01:38:15,612
Each breath you take is a sin.

1194
01:38:17,124 --> 01:38:19,524
No shadow will be safe again.

1195
01:38:19,727 --> 01:38:24,460
For you will be hunted by angels.

1196
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:27,868
You believe in God?

1197
01:38:29,136 --> 01:38:31,627
Your God doesn`t
forgive murderers.

1198
01:38:35,175 --> 01:38:37,006
He burns them.

1199
01:38:48,222 --> 01:38:49,211
Sophie.

1200
01:39:30,597 --> 01:39:32,155
The Teacher will be pleased.

1201
01:39:32,366 --> 01:39:34,561
What will you do
once you have the Grail?

1202
01:39:34,768 --> 01:39:36,030
Destroy it.

1203
01:39:36,236 --> 01:39:39,865
The documents and the
sarcophagus, of course.

1204
01:39:41,208 --> 01:39:42,607
And the heir?

1205
01:39:46,413 --> 01:39:49,871
Will you eXercise the final edict?
Spill his blood?

1206
01:39:50,484 --> 01:39:51,951
There will be no need.

1207
01:39:52,152 --> 01:39:56,851
Once the sarcophagus is destroyed,
DNA testing will be impossible.

1208
01:39:57,057 --> 01:39:59,787
There is no way to prove
a living bloodline.

1209
01:40:00,494 --> 01:40:02,121
But if you had to...

1210
01:40:03,764 --> 01:40:06,790
...would you do as councils
have done before us?

1211
01:40:15,776 --> 01:40:17,073
Christ....

1212
01:40:22,016 --> 01:40:26,282
Christ sacrificed his life
for the betterment of humanity.

1213
01:40:29,723 --> 01:40:32,624
So, too, may be the fate of his seed.

1214
01:40:42,269 --> 01:40:43,759
Robert.

1215
01:40:43,971 --> 01:40:47,930
When we land, you must go
straight to your embassy.

1216
01:40:49,276 --> 01:40:50,743
ls that so?

1217
01:40:52,679 --> 01:40:54,772
Don`t you see it?

1218
01:40:54,982 --> 01:40:56,711
They never wanted you.

1219
01:40:57,551 --> 01:41:00,247
Maybe even Fache didn`t.

1220
01:41:00,454 --> 01:41:03,514
lt`s all about this...

1221
01:41:03,724 --> 01:41:05,385
...idiotic little boX.

1222
01:41:10,197 --> 01:41:12,165
That`s not too flattering.

1223
01:41:12,833 --> 01:41:15,165
Crazy old man.

1224
01:41:15,536 --> 01:41:17,766
Why leave me with this?

1225
01:41:18,172 --> 01:41:20,766
l should just throw it away.

1226
01:41:25,079 --> 01:41:26,842
He trusted you, Sophie.

1227
01:41:27,881 --> 01:41:31,214
A guardian of the Holy Grail.

1228
01:41:32,820 --> 01:41:35,186
lt sounds so stupid.

1229
01:41:36,423 --> 01:41:40,792
lt`s quite an honor,
if you think about it...

1230
01:41:40,994 --> 01:41:42,291
...and take it seriously.

1231
01:41:42,729 --> 01:41:45,459
He took it seriously enough
to get himself killed.

1232
01:41:46,166 --> 01:41:48,259
Not him. You.

1233
01:41:51,171 --> 01:41:53,833
He was the only family l knew.

1234
01:41:54,341 --> 01:41:56,639
And maybe l didn`t know him at all.

1235
01:41:58,245 --> 01:42:00,236
l`m his marionette, Robert.

1236
01:42:00,447 --> 01:42:03,541
Like a girl again,
just with no gift at the end.

1237
01:42:09,289 --> 01:42:11,189
But you`ve done enough.

1238
01:42:13,894 --> 01:42:18,558
l don`t know why Saunière
picked me to help you, Sophie.

1239
01:42:20,868 --> 01:42:24,235
But l won`t leave you alone
in all this.

1240
01:42:30,544 --> 01:42:32,171
Two marionettes, then.

1241
01:42:36,016 --> 01:42:38,177
Maybe this is why he chose you.

1242
01:42:41,321 --> 01:42:43,653
Because you will stay.

1243
01:42:59,139 --> 01:43:00,902
l need the flight plan.

1244
01:43:01,241 --> 01:43:02,230
Ten minutes.

1245
01:43:03,243 --> 01:43:05,575
l asked you to get it for me.

1246
01:43:06,747 --> 01:43:08,647
l`m on break.

1247
01:43:10,117 --> 01:43:11,675
Come back in 1 0 minutes.

1248
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:15,847
My nose! My nose!

1249
01:43:16,456 --> 01:43:17,855
The flight plan, please.

1250
01:43:18,058 --> 01:43:19,025
You asshole!

1251
01:43:32,306 --> 01:43:34,035
lt`s not ``cross.``

1252
01:43:35,275 --> 01:43:36,572
``Spear``?

1253
01:43:43,584 --> 01:43:45,108
What happened to her?

1254
01:43:45,886 --> 01:43:47,478
No one knows.

1255
01:43:47,921 --> 01:43:51,254
Mary Magdalene lived out
her days in hiding.

1256
01:43:52,926 --> 01:43:55,326
And the zealots pursued her still...

1257
01:43:55,929 --> 01:44:00,298
...even in death, trying to destroy
proof of her eXistence.

1258
01:44:01,301 --> 01:44:03,633
But she always had her Knights.

1259
01:44:03,837 --> 01:44:06,271
Brave men sworn to defend her.

1260
01:44:06,473 --> 01:44:09,033
You see, to worship
before her sarcophagus...

1261
01:44:09,543 --> 01:44:12,808
...to kneel before the bones
of Mary Magdalene...

1262
01:44:13,013 --> 01:44:16,176
...was to remember all those
who were robbed of their power...

1263
01:44:16,383 --> 01:44:17,372
...who were oppressed.

1264
01:44:17,784 --> 01:44:22,221
Ultimately, the Priory hid her remains
and the proof of her bloodline...

1265
01:44:22,422 --> 01:44:25,050
...until most believed
her sarcophagus...

1266
01:44:26,059 --> 01:44:27,720
...the Holy Grail...

1267
01:44:28,729 --> 01:44:31,698
...was finally lost in time.

1268
01:44:42,643 --> 01:44:43,632
What are you doing?

1269
01:44:43,844 --> 01:44:46,472
At the chateau, you said,
``lt hides beneath the Rose.``

1270
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:48,045
No, no, no. Do be careful.

1271
01:44:48,248 --> 01:44:51,843
ln Latin, sub rosa.
Literal translation....

1272
01:44:52,052 --> 01:44:53,644
``Beneath the rose.``

1273
01:45:06,667 --> 01:45:08,134
We need a mirror.

1274
01:45:08,335 --> 01:45:11,168
Backwards. ln the style
of Leonardo himself.

1275
01:45:11,371 --> 01:45:13,032
Thank you.

1276
01:45:17,377 --> 01:45:21,336
In London lies a knight
a Pope interred

1277
01:45:21,548 --> 01:45:25,245
His labor`s fruit
a Holy wrath incurred

1278
01:45:25,652 --> 01:45:28,587
You seek the orb
that ought be on his tomb

1279
01:45:28,989 --> 01:45:32,618
It speaks of Rosy flesh
and seeded womb

1280
01:45:32,826 --> 01:45:36,762
``ln London lies a knight
a Pope interred``?

1281
01:45:36,963 --> 01:45:40,763
A knight whose funeral
was presided over by the Pope.

1282
01:45:40,967 --> 01:45:44,164
Of course, the Priory knights
were not just any knights.

1283
01:45:44,371 --> 01:45:45,338
Templars.

1284
01:45:45,539 --> 01:45:48,633
And there`s just one place to bury
a Templar knight in London.

1285
01:45:48,842 --> 01:45:49,934
Temple Church.

1286
01:45:50,143 --> 01:45:52,304
Temple Church.
lf you`ll eXcuse me, my dear...

1287
01:45:52,512 --> 01:45:55,345
...Roger and l must discuss
a change in flight plan.

1288
01:45:55,549 --> 01:45:56,914
Leigh.

1289
01:45:58,652 --> 01:46:01,052
Harboring and transporting
fugitives?

1290
01:46:01,822 --> 01:46:04,382
You are already implicated enough.

1291
01:46:05,592 --> 01:46:09,187
You and l, Robert,
have observed history.

1292
01:46:09,396 --> 01:46:11,626
Time has been our glass.

1293
01:46:12,199 --> 01:46:15,396
We are in history now. Living it.

1294
01:46:17,104 --> 01:46:18,731
Making it.

1295
01:46:19,439 --> 01:46:20,872
``lmplicated``?

1296
01:46:21,108 --> 01:46:23,633
l am on a Grail quest.

1297
01:46:25,278 --> 01:46:26,768
Forgive me, Robert...

1298
01:46:26,980 --> 01:46:29,278
...but you two may well
have given this old man...

1299
01:46:29,483 --> 01:46:31,815
...the greatest night of his life.

1300
01:46:33,687 --> 01:46:34,813
Thank you.

1301
01:46:36,923 --> 01:46:39,050
He`s going to want more money.

1302
01:46:56,176 --> 01:47:00,272
l suppose this is a new technique
for investigations.

1303
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:05,577
l`ve lost them.
They flew to Switzerland.

1304
01:47:05,852 --> 01:47:08,047
No eXtradition.

1305
01:47:10,824 --> 01:47:17,093
The controller filed charges.
Ari was on dispatch. He called me.

1306
01:47:21,201 --> 01:47:24,261
What`s going on, Bezu?

1307
01:47:27,307 --> 01:47:30,140
You know that l am Opus Dei?

1308
01:47:30,544 --> 01:47:32,068
Yes.

1309
01:47:37,384 --> 01:47:40,876
A bishop of my order called me.

1310
01:47:41,221 --> 01:47:43,314
He said a killer
came to him in confession.

1311
01:47:43,523 --> 01:47:46,253
His name was Robert Langdon.

1312
01:47:47,461 --> 01:47:50,555
He said l couldn`t imagine
the evil in this man`s heart.

1313
01:47:50,764 --> 01:47:53,460
That he would keep killing.

1314
01:47:53,867 --> 01:47:56,301
He said l had to stop him.

1315
01:47:58,371 --> 01:48:02,171
The bishop broke his vows
to tell me this.

1316
01:48:02,375 --> 01:48:05,776
He charged me
to stop Robert Langdon.

1317
01:48:08,748 --> 01:48:13,481
Tell me, Collet, who have l failed?

1318
01:48:14,321 --> 01:48:16,084
The bishop?

1319
01:48:17,424 --> 01:48:19,483
God himself?

1320
01:48:28,168 --> 01:48:31,228
They`ve changed their flight plan
to London.

1321
01:48:37,177 --> 01:48:41,614
Go on, Fache.
l`ll take care of the controller.

1322
01:48:41,815 --> 01:48:46,912
Maybe he needs a few eXtra euros.

1323
01:48:47,821 --> 01:48:51,552
Just tell me neXt time.

1324
01:49:15,715 --> 01:49:19,446
l have them, tower. Relay Hawker
to land and hold on tarmac.

1325
01:50:16,743 --> 01:50:18,938
-Secure the area!
-Wider!

1326
01:50:19,145 --> 01:50:21,238
-Armed police!
-You two, round the back!

1327
01:50:21,615 --> 01:50:24,812
Armed police!
Put your hands in the air!

1328
01:50:25,018 --> 01:50:26,952
-Three men up!
-Ready!

1329
01:50:27,153 --> 01:50:29,747
Put your hands in the air! Do it now!

1330
01:50:29,956 --> 01:50:32,356
l`m afraid that`s
easier said than done in my case.

1331
01:50:34,427 --> 01:50:35,724
Oh, good morning.

1332
01:50:35,929 --> 01:50:38,796
Did that old cannabis charge
finally catch up with me?

1333
01:50:38,999 --> 01:50:41,695
Sir, the French police say
you`re transporting fugitives...

1334
01:50:41,901 --> 01:50:43,664
...and you may have
a hostage onboard.

1335
01:50:43,870 --> 01:50:45,394
l`m to take you all into custody.

1336
01:50:45,605 --> 01:50:48,938
Sadly, l have an important medical
appointment which l can`t miss.

1337
01:50:49,142 --> 01:50:50,370
l`ll fetch the car, sir.

1338
01:50:50,577 --> 01:50:53,410
This is serious, sir. The French police
are on their way. Stop!

1339
01:50:54,014 --> 01:50:57,279
lnspector, l can`t afford the time
to indulge your games.

1340
01:50:57,484 --> 01:50:58,815
l`m late and l`m leaving.

1341
01:50:59,019 --> 01:51:00,850
lf it`s so important
for you to stop us...

1342
01:51:01,054 --> 01:51:03,284
...then you`re just going
to have to shoot us.

1343
01:51:03,823 --> 01:51:05,450
You can start with him.

1344
01:51:10,864 --> 01:51:12,422
Search the plane.

1345
01:51:12,632 --> 01:51:13,860
All right.

1346
01:51:26,079 --> 01:51:27,740
l could run them over.

1347
01:51:33,253 --> 01:51:34,345
Bad tip.

1348
01:51:36,389 --> 01:51:37,754
Let him go.

1349
01:51:42,262 --> 01:51:44,628
The French cannot be trusted.

1350
01:51:53,339 --> 01:51:54,306
Everyone comfy?

1351
01:51:56,776 --> 01:51:57,743
Biscuits?

1352
01:51:58,311 --> 01:51:59,972
They didn`t notice anything?

1353
01:52:00,380 --> 01:52:04,840
Well, people rarely notice things right
in front of their eyes, don`t you find?

1354
01:52:18,932 --> 01:52:21,457
Do you have the bonds, bishop?

1355
01:52:21,701 --> 01:52:22,929
Yes, l do, Teacher.

1356
01:52:23,136 --> 01:52:26,435
I have chosen an Opus Dei
residence for the exchange.

1357
01:52:26,639 --> 01:52:28,072
l am honored.

1358
01:52:28,341 --> 01:52:33,142
By the time you get to London,
I will have the Grail.

1359
01:52:35,749 --> 01:52:38,718
-l take it the news is good, then.
-l fly to London.

1360
01:52:38,918 --> 01:52:40,909
The Teacher is waiting for me there.

1361
01:52:41,121 --> 01:52:44,716
He has chosen a house of Opus Dei
to make the eXchange.

1362
01:52:44,924 --> 01:52:49,293
Mere currency
for the location of the Grail.

1363
01:52:49,496 --> 01:52:51,464
lmagine it.

1364
01:52:57,370 --> 01:53:02,364
Remember, if we are discovered by
the Vatican, we are eXcommunicated.

1365
01:53:02,575 --> 01:53:05,567
-So should anything go wrong--
-Yes, l know, l know.

1366
01:53:06,713 --> 01:53:08,374
This council does not eXist.

1367
01:53:09,382 --> 01:53:11,111
As it never has.

1368
01:53:13,987 --> 01:53:17,718
Old friend. Heaven protect you.

1369
01:53:25,231 --> 01:53:27,199
Keep an eye out for the police.

1370
01:53:40,346 --> 01:53:42,974
l must say, Robert,
l`m quite impressed...

1371
01:53:43,183 --> 01:53:46,448
...by the way you withstood
my little aeroplane.

1372
01:53:48,087 --> 01:53:49,611
Did he never tell you?

1373
01:53:49,823 --> 01:53:53,122
When he was a boy,
young Robert fell into a well.

1374
01:53:53,326 --> 01:53:54,953
How old were you?

1375
01:53:55,161 --> 01:53:56,287
Seven.

1376
01:53:58,998 --> 01:54:02,058
Treading water all night long,
screaming his lungs out...

1377
01:54:02,268 --> 01:54:04,259
...to the echoes screaming back.

1378
01:54:04,470 --> 01:54:06,995
When they found him,
he was nearly catatonic.

1379
01:54:07,207 --> 01:54:08,265
Help!

1380
01:54:09,342 --> 01:54:10,673
lt was a long time ago.

1381
01:54:10,877 --> 01:54:12,469
Oh, now, now, Robert.

1382
01:54:12,679 --> 01:54:17,173
You above all people shouldn`t be one
to dismiss the influence of the past.

1383
01:54:22,388 --> 01:54:25,687
Temple Church.
l always forget it`s right here.

1384
01:54:25,892 --> 01:54:31,558
Built 1 1 85 and modern London
just sprang up right around it.

1385
01:54:34,667 --> 01:54:38,933
Tell me, why has the Priory kept the
Grail location secret all these years?

1386
01:54:39,138 --> 01:54:40,105
l don`t know.

1387
01:54:40,506 --> 01:54:43,134
Some say the Priory wait
for the heir to reveal himself...

1388
01:54:43,343 --> 01:54:45,106
...which is especially odd...

1389
01:54:45,311 --> 01:54:48,644
...since legend suggests he may not
know his own true identity.

1390
01:54:56,656 --> 01:54:57,623
Hello?

1391
01:54:58,424 --> 01:55:01,052
Why do they make them so scary?

1392
01:55:06,699 --> 01:55:07,791
Oh, it`s cold.

1393
01:55:08,001 --> 01:55:11,300
``ln London lies a knight
a Pope interred.``

1394
01:55:21,180 --> 01:55:24,581
So which tomb has an orb?

1395
01:55:40,934 --> 01:55:44,131
Those knights
with their legs crossed...

1396
01:55:44,337 --> 01:55:46,396
...means they`d been
to the Holy Land.

1397
01:55:46,606 --> 01:55:49,837
Two wear tunics over their armor...

1398
01:55:50,043 --> 01:55:53,171
...and two have full-length robes.

1399
01:55:54,247 --> 01:55:55,976
Two are grasping swords.

1400
01:55:56,449 --> 01:56:00,044
And one-- Two are praying.

1401
01:56:02,021 --> 01:56:03,989
This one has his arms at his sides.

1402
01:56:04,190 --> 01:56:07,853
Oh, and this poor fellow
has almost disappeared entirely.

1403
01:56:08,061 --> 01:56:12,760
l don`t see any orb
that ought be on a tomb.

1404
01:56:13,666 --> 01:56:16,396
``Ought be on his tomb.``
Are we looking for a missing orb?

1405
01:56:16,602 --> 01:56:18,467
Maybe.

1406
01:56:29,282 --> 01:56:30,840
These aren`t tombs.

1407
01:56:31,050 --> 01:56:33,416
-What? Yes, of course they are.
-No.

1408
01:56:33,619 --> 01:56:35,610
-They`re effigies.
-What?

1409
01:56:35,822 --> 01:56:37,722
Not tombs. There`s no bodies here.

1410
01:56:38,091 --> 01:56:39,524
This place is wrong.

1411
01:56:41,561 --> 01:56:44,894
Can we go now? We should go.

1412
01:56:48,101 --> 01:56:49,762
Sophie! No!

1413
01:56:51,537 --> 01:56:52,970
Where is the keystone?

1414
01:56:54,107 --> 01:56:55,233
Do not test me!

1415
01:56:55,441 --> 01:56:56,703
-Let her go!
-Don`t hurt her.

1416
01:56:56,909 --> 01:56:58,968
Give me the keystone! Give it to me!

1417
01:56:59,178 --> 01:57:00,873
Here! Here! Here it is! Here it is.

1418
01:57:01,080 --> 01:57:04,709
Just let her go, and you and l can--
We`ll come to some agreement.

1419
01:57:05,318 --> 01:57:06,751
Remy.

1420
01:57:10,123 --> 01:57:12,648
Remy. No, no, no. No, put it away.

1421
01:57:13,960 --> 01:57:17,191
Put it away. They`re too close
together. You don`t have a clear shot.

1422
01:57:17,397 --> 01:57:19,763
-Yes, l do.
-What do you think you`re doing?

1423
01:57:22,035 --> 01:57:26,438
Thank you, professor. For a moment,
this was getting complicated.

1424
01:57:26,639 --> 01:57:28,698
Oh, this is absurd.
Oh, for God`s sake, man!

1425
01:57:32,045 --> 01:57:34,138
That was satisfying.

1426
01:57:34,347 --> 01:57:36,212
l`m glad this bullshit is over.

1427
01:57:39,452 --> 01:57:41,181
Throw Teabing in the trunk.

1428
01:57:41,387 --> 01:57:42,615
What?

1429
01:57:48,061 --> 01:57:50,029
Here. You okay?

1430
01:57:55,568 --> 01:57:56,535
Sorry.

1431
01:58:37,510 --> 01:58:39,307
l don`t think he`s following.

1432
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:51,422
They won`t kill Leigh
until they find the Grail.

1433
01:58:53,526 --> 01:58:56,757
-So we have to find it before they do.
-l have to get to a library, fast.

1434
01:59:04,704 --> 01:59:06,331
Lieutenant!

1435
01:59:06,539 --> 01:59:08,131
One flag off the prints.

1436
01:59:11,844 --> 01:59:13,835
Remy Legaludec.

1437
01:59:14,046 --> 01:59:15,638
Petty theft.

1438
01:59:17,450 --> 01:59:21,216
Skipped out on a hospital bill
for a tracheotomy.

1439
01:59:23,122 --> 01:59:24,953
Peanut allergy.

1440
01:59:26,392 --> 01:59:27,757
Like Marie.

1441
01:59:27,960 --> 01:59:29,393
This way. Marie?

1442
01:59:29,595 --> 01:59:32,257
My daughter.

1443
01:59:32,465 --> 01:59:34,057
Over here.

1444
01:59:40,940 --> 01:59:41,929
Where?

1445
01:59:42,141 --> 01:59:43,403
Up there.

1446
02:00:00,826 --> 02:00:02,487
What`s all that?

1447
02:00:02,695 --> 02:00:05,027
Very advanced surveillance.

1448
02:00:09,769 --> 02:00:11,066
lt`s a listening post.

1449
02:00:20,546 --> 02:00:22,707
Get me Fache.

1450
02:00:22,915 --> 02:00:27,818
Four of these names are
the men killed last night.

1451
02:00:35,962 --> 02:00:40,899
He once whined to me about the
wasted space of so large a trunk.

1452
02:00:41,367 --> 02:00:43,494
Let`s see if he complains so now.

1453
02:00:44,570 --> 02:00:46,504
Are you the Teacher?

1454
02:00:49,742 --> 02:00:50,766
l am.

1455
02:00:52,578 --> 02:00:57,072
Superbly done.
You`ve been of great service.

1456
02:01:00,586 --> 02:01:03,350
The crypteX has yet to be opened.
l can still serve.

1457
02:01:03,556 --> 02:01:05,683
You`ve done enough.

1458
02:01:08,928 --> 02:01:12,591
We cannot let ego
deter us from our goal.

1459
02:01:13,766 --> 02:01:15,700
l understand.

1460
02:01:16,769 --> 02:01:17,895
Good.

1461
02:01:21,107 --> 02:01:25,874
Wait here, at this house of Opus Dei,
and you will be rewarded.

1462
02:01:26,078 --> 02:01:28,273
l will dispose of the old man.

1463
02:01:29,448 --> 02:01:31,075
Bless you, Silas.

1464
02:01:33,119 --> 02:01:34,347
Teacher.

1465
02:01:42,561 --> 02:01:44,290
Christ be with you.

1466
02:01:47,033 --> 02:01:52,164
We`re at least a half-hour
to Chelsea Library.

1467
02:01:52,471 --> 02:01:54,496
lf we`re gonna help Leigh,
that`s too long.

1468
02:02:06,218 --> 02:02:07,617
Where you going?

1469
02:02:07,820 --> 02:02:09,947
Getting you a library card.

1470
02:02:13,559 --> 02:02:15,584
EXcuse me. May l sit neXt to you?

1471
02:02:15,795 --> 02:02:18,286
-Yeah, sure.
-Thank you.

1472
02:02:26,839 --> 02:02:28,136
That`s great.

1473
02:02:29,075 --> 02:02:31,270
Didn`t say you had a boyfriend.

1474
02:02:33,979 --> 02:02:35,276
Thanks.

1475
02:02:35,915 --> 02:02:39,214
Let`s see if we can access
the database on this.

1476
02:02:39,418 --> 02:02:42,819
``ln London lies a knight
a Pope interred.``

1477
02:02:43,022 --> 02:02:44,785
Compounding keywords:

1478
02:02:44,990 --> 02:02:47,857
Knight, Pope, Grail.

1479
02:02:48,494 --> 02:02:52,487
Your precious treasure was
almost lost, and with it, my fortune.

1480
02:02:56,902 --> 02:02:59,166
Can you believe how well l did?

1481
02:03:00,740 --> 02:03:02,867
l even convinced the monk.

1482
02:03:03,743 --> 02:03:05,677
l should be in theater.

1483
02:03:12,385 --> 02:03:17,880
A toast to our success, Teacher.
The end of the journey is near.

1484
02:03:20,426 --> 02:03:23,725
Your identity shall go
with me to the grave.

1485
02:03:29,168 --> 02:03:32,797
There`s your problem, mate.
lt`s your basic linguistic coincidence.

1486
02:03:33,239 --> 02:03:35,366
See, keywords keep coming up
with the writings...

1487
02:03:35,574 --> 02:03:38,509
...of some bloke named
AleXander Pope.

1488
02:03:38,711 --> 02:03:39,939
``A. Pope.``

1489
02:03:41,580 --> 02:03:43,343
Your grandfather was a genius.

1490
02:03:48,254 --> 02:03:49,278
Come on.

1491
02:04:23,956 --> 02:04:25,651
Emergency.
Which service do you require?

1492
02:04:25,858 --> 02:04:30,955
l know the location of two murderers
wanted by French police.

1493
02:04:34,867 --> 02:04:36,960
We`ve just had a 999 call.

1494
02:04:37,169 --> 02:04:39,501
Triangulation leads back
to Docklands.

1495
02:04:39,705 --> 02:04:41,764
Caller was male.
Claimed your two murderers...

1496
02:04:41,974 --> 02:04:44,568
...are hiding at an Opus Dei house.

1497
02:04:53,719 --> 02:04:57,815
The knight we`re looking for
is Sir lsaac Newton.

1498
02:04:59,358 --> 02:05:03,055
His life`s work produced new sciences
that incurred the wrath of the Church.

1499
02:05:03,562 --> 02:05:05,826
Gravity, for God sakes.

1500
02:05:07,199 --> 02:05:10,259
And if you choose to believe...

1501
02:05:10,469 --> 02:05:14,872
...he was also a Grand Master
of the Priory as well.

1502
02:05:25,451 --> 02:05:28,045
But if he offended
the Catholic Church...

1503
02:05:28,254 --> 02:05:32,020
...the Pope would be the last person
to preside over his funeral.

1504
02:05:32,224 --> 02:05:34,419
Well, that`s where l got it wrong.

1505
02:05:34,627 --> 02:05:37,528
``ln London lies a knight
a Pope interred.``

1506
02:05:37,730 --> 02:05:40,790
Sir lsaac Newton`s funeral
was presided over...

1507
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:44,629
...by his good friend,
his colleague, AleXander Pope.

1508
02:05:44,837 --> 02:05:49,274
A. Pope. His first initial.
How did l miss that?

1509
02:05:49,742 --> 02:05:50,800
Here.

1510
02:05:51,176 --> 02:05:54,304
Yes. lsaac Newton`s tomb.

1511
02:05:55,447 --> 02:05:56,641
An orb.

1512
02:05:56,849 --> 02:06:01,809
Yes. Which one? lt`s not possible
to tell if a particular orb is missing.

1513
02:06:02,021 --> 02:06:05,513
``An orb with Rosy flesh
and seeded womb.``

1514
02:06:05,724 --> 02:06:10,286
Solar system. The planets.
Constellations. Signs of the zodiac.

1515
02:06:10,896 --> 02:06:12,989
See, our moon is missing.

1516
02:06:13,198 --> 02:06:16,031
The moons of Saturn and Jupiter.
They`re not here.

1517
02:06:16,402 --> 02:06:18,927
Eyes of the cherubs themselves?

1518
02:06:20,940 --> 02:06:23,841
Robert. These tracks.

1519
02:06:24,710 --> 02:06:27,008
Look at the cane marks in the dust.

1520
02:06:30,115 --> 02:06:31,514
Teabing was here.

1521
02:06:32,918 --> 02:06:34,078
He was alone.

1522
02:06:36,088 --> 02:06:40,184
When the two of you
arrived at my home as you did...

1523
02:06:41,327 --> 02:06:44,125
...others might call it God`s will.

1524
02:06:45,030 --> 02:06:47,521
l believed that if l had the crypteX...

1525
02:06:47,900 --> 02:06:50,926
...l could solve the riddle alone.

1526
02:06:51,837 --> 02:06:53,304
But l was unworthy.

1527
02:06:53,505 --> 02:06:54,767
But you....

1528
02:06:55,608 --> 02:06:58,042
You have a reason to be here.

1529
02:06:58,243 --> 02:07:01,872
You`re the last remaining
guardian of the Grail.

1530
02:07:02,114 --> 02:07:04,207
Your grandfather
and the other sénéchaux...

1531
02:07:04,416 --> 02:07:06,384
...would not have lied
with dying breath...

1532
02:07:06,585 --> 02:07:09,418
...unless they knew
their secret was preserved.

1533
02:07:11,857 --> 02:07:14,587
How could you know
Saunière`s last words?

1534
02:07:14,793 --> 02:07:15,760
Leigh.

1535
02:07:16,962 --> 02:07:19,226
Grail quests require sacrifice.

1536
02:07:19,765 --> 02:07:21,096
You are a murderer.

1537
02:07:21,300 --> 02:07:24,326
No. No. Robert, tell her.

1538
02:07:24,536 --> 02:07:28,336
When history is written,
murderers are heroes.

1539
02:07:30,442 --> 02:07:32,467
You self-righteous bastard!

1540
02:07:32,678 --> 02:07:33,975
We need to just walk away.

1541
02:07:34,179 --> 02:07:35,976
-No, don`t. Don`t.
-Walk away.

1542
02:07:39,284 --> 02:07:40,842
l`ll do what l have to now.

1543
02:07:46,191 --> 02:07:47,317
Anything.

1544
02:07:51,463 --> 02:07:52,896
Do you understand?

1545
02:07:54,600 --> 02:07:56,261
So now...

1546
02:07:57,469 --> 02:07:59,494
...can`t we all be friends again?

1547
02:08:00,806 --> 02:08:02,103
This way.

1548
02:08:38,377 --> 02:08:42,177
l`m going to put this gun down.
l only want you both to listen.

1549
02:08:44,049 --> 02:08:45,243
l`m listening now.

1550
02:08:45,851 --> 02:08:47,250
For 2000 years...

1551
02:08:47,886 --> 02:08:51,788
...the Church has rained oppression
and atrocity upon mankind...

1552
02:08:52,591 --> 02:08:57,528
...crushed passion and idea alike,
all in the name of their walking God.

1553
02:08:57,796 --> 02:09:02,199
Proof of Jesus` mortality can bring
an end to all that suffering...

1554
02:09:02,701 --> 02:09:05,602
...drive this church of lies
to its knees.

1555
02:09:07,272 --> 02:09:08,830
Armed police!

1556
02:09:09,108 --> 02:09:10,405
Drop your weapon!

1557
02:09:14,012 --> 02:09:14,979
Stop, Silas!

1558
02:09:27,826 --> 02:09:30,954
We are betrayed, my son.

1559
02:09:31,563 --> 02:09:34,157
The living heir must be revealed.

1560
02:09:34,666 --> 02:09:36,896
Jesus must be shown
for what he was.

1561
02:09:37,102 --> 02:09:40,299
Not miraculous, simply man.

1562
02:09:41,406 --> 02:09:42,873
l`m sorry.

1563
02:09:45,043 --> 02:09:46,635
Armed police!

1564
02:09:47,012 --> 02:09:50,106
Drop your weapon! Drop it! Drop it!

1565
02:09:59,558 --> 02:10:02,049
Put it down now! Put it down!

1566
02:10:09,768 --> 02:10:11,793
l am a ghost.

1567
02:10:12,971 --> 02:10:15,565
The dark con can be eXposed.

1568
02:10:15,808 --> 02:10:21,110
Mankind can finally be set free,
and we can do it, Robert.

1569
02:10:22,381 --> 02:10:23,905
The three of us.

1570
02:10:41,834 --> 02:10:43,233
How is Silas?

1571
02:10:43,435 --> 02:10:45,767
ls he--? ls he alive?

1572
02:10:46,138 --> 02:10:47,230
The monk?

1573
02:10:50,809 --> 02:10:53,744
Bishop, how would you know
this killer`s name?

1574
02:10:55,314 --> 02:10:57,009
Get me out of here, Fache.

1575
02:10:57,583 --> 02:10:58,572
Wait.

1576
02:11:02,087 --> 02:11:05,079
Langdon never came to you
in confession, did he?

1577
02:11:05,824 --> 02:11:10,022
One of your followers called you
about the crime-scene photos.

1578
02:11:10,929 --> 02:11:15,889
l cannot be implicated here. There are
still important works to be done.

1579
02:11:17,669 --> 02:11:18,966
You used me.

1580
02:11:20,873 --> 02:11:22,898
God uses us all.

1581
02:11:23,709 --> 02:11:25,233
Help me, Fache.

1582
02:11:26,411 --> 02:11:27,469
Take him.

1583
02:11:32,184 --> 02:11:34,015
-Did you get his cell phone?
-Yes, sir.

1584
02:11:34,219 --> 02:11:36,244
l`m going to need a trace.

1585
02:11:39,124 --> 02:11:40,921
Your Silas is dead.

1586
02:11:48,066 --> 02:11:49,795
The Priory`s sacred charge...

1587
02:11:50,002 --> 02:11:53,028
...was to reveal the heir
at the dawn of the new millennium.

1588
02:11:54,039 --> 02:11:59,170
The millennium came and went
and the living heir remained hidden.

1589
02:11:59,378 --> 02:12:03,280
The Priory failed
in their sacred charge.

1590
02:12:04,082 --> 02:12:06,107
So, what choice did l have?

1591
02:12:10,389 --> 02:12:12,186
l sought out the enemy.

1592
02:12:13,659 --> 02:12:18,062
l persuaded them, the Council
of Shadows, that l was an ally.

1593
02:12:18,630 --> 02:12:22,327
l even asked them for money
so they would never suspect me.

1594
02:12:22,834 --> 02:12:25,803
Rector, l made them call me.

1595
02:12:26,371 --> 02:12:27,338
``Teacher.``

1596
02:12:27,606 --> 02:12:28,834
-Why don`t you and l--
-No.

1597
02:12:29,041 --> 02:12:31,601
Robert, no words. On your knees.

1598
02:12:32,077 --> 02:12:33,237
Do it.

1599
02:12:33,812 --> 02:12:35,177
No, l mean it. Down.

1600
02:12:36,248 --> 02:12:39,046
Not you. No, my dear, you....

1601
02:12:41,720 --> 02:12:44,086
You`re my miracle, Sophie.

1602
02:12:44,756 --> 02:12:47,190
You`re the guardian of the Grail.

1603
02:12:48,160 --> 02:12:51,652
All the oppression of the poor
and the powerless...

1604
02:12:51,863 --> 02:12:54,730
...of those of different skin,
of women.

1605
02:12:54,933 --> 02:12:58,164
You can put an end to all that.

1606
02:12:58,370 --> 02:13:02,067
You must eXplode the truth
onto the world.

1607
02:13:02,874 --> 02:13:04,341
lt`s your duty.

1608
02:13:07,279 --> 02:13:10,009
You know the answer to this riddle.

1609
02:13:11,483 --> 02:13:12,973
Open the crypteX...

1610
02:13:14,619 --> 02:13:16,280
...and l`ll put down the gun.

1611
02:13:34,473 --> 02:13:36,441
l have no idea how.

1612
02:13:36,641 --> 02:13:38,506
l don`t know the code.

1613
02:13:38,710 --> 02:13:41,372
And even if l did, l wouldn`t tell you.

1614
02:13:47,019 --> 02:13:49,317
Like your grandfather, then.

1615
02:13:50,055 --> 02:13:53,024
Willing to die for your secret.

1616
02:13:54,192 --> 02:13:57,684
But by the way you`ve been
looking at your hero...

1617
02:13:57,896 --> 02:14:02,629
...l wonder, would you
let him die for you?

1618
02:14:03,035 --> 02:14:05,230
Open it, Sophie, to save his life.

1619
02:14:05,437 --> 02:14:07,564
-Leigh, you can`t just--
-Open the crypteX.

1620
02:14:08,240 --> 02:14:09,229
l don`t know how.

1621
02:14:09,441 --> 02:14:11,341
Open it or he dies.

1622
02:14:11,543 --> 02:14:13,443
-l swear, l don`t know.
-Do it! Do it!

1623
02:14:13,645 --> 02:14:14,942
-Stop it!
-l don`t know!

1624
02:14:15,147 --> 02:14:16,478
Stop it!

1625
02:14:22,054 --> 02:14:24,045
She can`t do it, Leigh.

1626
02:14:36,101 --> 02:14:37,898
But give me a moment.

1627
02:14:48,080 --> 02:14:49,707
Robert.

1628
02:15:02,894 --> 02:15:04,020
What are you doing?

1629
02:15:04,830 --> 02:15:05,990
Please.

1630
02:16:26,211 --> 02:16:27,644
l`m sorry.

1631
02:16:37,822 --> 02:16:38,914
l`m sorry.

1632
02:16:41,927 --> 02:16:43,360
No!

1633
02:16:51,403 --> 02:16:52,563
No, Robert!

1634
02:16:53,572 --> 02:16:54,834
No!

1635
02:16:55,740 --> 02:16:56,707
No.

1636
02:16:57,209 --> 02:16:59,404
Oh, the map. lt`s ruined.

1637
02:17:06,851 --> 02:17:08,318
The map is ruined.

1638
02:17:09,254 --> 02:17:10,585
The Grail.

1639
02:17:11,189 --> 02:17:12,315
lt`s lost.

1640
02:17:13,024 --> 02:17:14,491
The Grail is gone.

1641
02:17:14,859 --> 02:17:17,589
Only the worthy
find the Grail, Leigh.

1642
02:17:18,697 --> 02:17:20,255
You taught me that.

1643
02:17:23,802 --> 02:17:24,894
Armed police!

1644
02:17:25,103 --> 02:17:27,435
Drop it! Drop your weapon!

1645
02:17:27,739 --> 02:17:29,138
Put the gun down.

1646
02:17:31,876 --> 02:17:34,208
Put the gun down.

1647
02:17:38,984 --> 02:17:41,748
That one. The old man.

1648
02:17:41,953 --> 02:17:42,920
You`re under arrest!

1649
02:17:43,121 --> 02:17:45,316
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defense...

1650
02:17:45,523 --> 02:17:47,423
...if you do not mention,
when questioned...

1651
02:17:47,626 --> 02:17:49,617
...something which you
later rely on in court.

1652
02:17:49,828 --> 02:17:52,490
Anything you do say
will be given in evidence.

1653
02:18:03,174 --> 02:18:05,472
l`ll have some questions for you.

1654
02:18:40,879 --> 02:18:43,347
Big crowd out there now.

1655
02:18:43,948 --> 02:18:47,384
Thank you for your statements.
You are free to go, of course.

1656
02:18:56,461 --> 02:18:59,089
l`m sorry. You thought
he was your friend, no?

1657
02:18:59,364 --> 02:19:01,798
lt wasn`t only us, was it?

1658
02:19:03,435 --> 02:19:05,096
He used you too.

1659
02:19:07,238 --> 02:19:08,796
Leave us, please.

1660
02:19:11,976 --> 02:19:12,965
Leave us, please.

1661
02:19:24,456 --> 02:19:27,016
l should have been smarter.

1662
02:19:27,225 --> 02:19:29,557
l acted on faith, l suppose.

1663
02:19:30,462 --> 02:19:31,827
l`m sorry.

1664
02:19:33,098 --> 02:19:34,690
How many?

1665
02:19:34,899 --> 02:19:38,062
Your grandfather, the other three,
maybe more.

1666
02:19:39,371 --> 02:19:43,808
The monk was given to Teabing
as a gift, it seems.

1667
02:19:45,143 --> 02:19:47,338
To do as he asked.

1668
02:19:47,645 --> 02:19:50,876
Teabing killed the servant himself,
you know.

1669
02:19:51,082 --> 02:19:53,880
-Remy?
-Yes.

1670
02:19:54,085 --> 02:19:55,109
By poison.

1671
02:19:57,922 --> 02:20:00,413
How much of it
have you been able to figure out?

1672
02:20:01,493 --> 02:20:05,327
Some. Not enough for it
to make sense.

1673
02:20:06,464 --> 02:20:08,022
lt won`t ever make sense.

1674
02:20:19,444 --> 02:20:20,604
l`m sorry.

1675
02:20:35,593 --> 02:20:38,619
He forgot everything we`ve learned.

1676
02:20:39,330 --> 02:20:41,389
Everything we teach.

1677
02:20:44,569 --> 02:20:47,333
lt`s why we study history.

1678
02:20:48,139 --> 02:20:51,165
So we`ll stop killing each other.

1679
02:21:13,264 --> 02:21:16,961
Robert! Robert! Robert!
How could you do it?

1680
02:21:17,168 --> 02:21:19,329
How could you? Robert!

1681
02:21:19,771 --> 02:21:22,069
To destroy our hope of freedom.

1682
02:21:22,474 --> 02:21:25,773
To deny every pilgrim the chance
to kneel at the tomb of the Magdalene.

1683
02:21:25,977 --> 02:21:27,171
How could you?

1684
02:21:31,916 --> 02:21:33,850
You couldn`t! You solved it.

1685
02:21:36,321 --> 02:21:39,779
You took the scroll out
before it broke!

1686
02:21:39,991 --> 02:21:43,950
You solved it. Oh, you`ll find it, Robert.
You`ll find it. You know what to do.

1687
02:21:44,162 --> 02:21:46,392
You`ll find the Grail,
you`ll kneel before her...

1688
02:21:46,598 --> 02:21:48,623
...and you`ll set her free
upon the world!

1689
02:21:48,833 --> 02:21:52,234
That man there,
he`s got the map to the Holy Grail!

1690
02:22:02,747 --> 02:22:07,650
There was every orb conceivable
on that tomb eXcept one:

1691
02:22:08,586 --> 02:22:12,750
The orb which fell from the heavens
and inspired Newton`s life`s work.

1692
02:22:12,957 --> 02:22:17,826
Work that incurred the wrath
of the Church until his dying day.

1693
02:22:21,099 --> 02:22:22,566
A-P-P-L-E.

1694
02:22:23,668 --> 02:22:24,862
Apple.

1695
02:22:39,484 --> 02:22:42,453
The Holy Grail `neath
ancient Roslin waits

1696
02:22:42,654 --> 02:22:45,020
The blade and chalice
guarding o`er her gates

1697
02:22:45,223 --> 02:22:47,282
Adorned in masters`
loving art, she lies

1698
02:22:47,492 --> 02:22:51,360
She rests at last
beneath the starry skies

1699
02:22:52,997 --> 02:22:54,931
l think l know where she`s gone.

1700
02:22:55,833 --> 02:22:58,358
l think the Grail has gone home.

1701
02:23:18,222 --> 02:23:23,057
Built by the Templars themselves.
Named for the original Rose Line.

1702
02:23:23,261 --> 02:23:25,126
Rosslyn Chapel.

1703
02:23:26,264 --> 02:23:28,027
So this is it.

1704
02:23:29,033 --> 02:23:30,898
The gift at the end.

1705
02:23:31,869 --> 02:23:35,600
``The Holy Grail `neath
ancient Roslin waits.``

1706
02:23:36,541 --> 02:23:39,772
You never told me the joke
Saunière made of you.

1707
02:23:40,044 --> 02:23:41,341
What was it?

1708
02:23:41,879 --> 02:23:43,779
He called me a flatfoot.

1709
02:23:44,082 --> 02:23:46,346
A beat cop of history.

1710
02:23:47,085 --> 02:23:49,144
Oh, a dumb policeman...

1711
02:23:49,354 --> 02:23:52,755
...who just does his job
day after day, of history.

1712
02:23:52,957 --> 02:23:56,723
You know, his father was one.
A policeman.

1713
02:23:57,362 --> 02:24:02,095
Saunière said he was the most
honorable man he had ever known.

1714
02:24:05,970 --> 02:24:08,632
We are who we protect, l think.

1715
02:24:09,574 --> 02:24:11,303
What we stand up for.

1716
02:24:23,221 --> 02:24:24,620
Jewish...

1717
02:24:25,723 --> 02:24:28,453
...Christian, Egyptian...

1718
02:24:29,761 --> 02:24:32,161
...Masonic, pagan...

1719
02:24:33,231 --> 02:24:34,960
...Templar crosses...

1720
02:24:35,566 --> 02:24:36,965
...pyramids.

1721
02:24:44,709 --> 02:24:48,475
l think l`ve been here before.

1722
02:24:48,680 --> 02:24:49,806
Sophie.

1723
02:25:09,701 --> 02:25:11,396
A very long time ago.

1724
02:25:13,771 --> 02:25:15,534
Come along, Sophie.

1725
02:25:30,788 --> 02:25:31,846
Sophie.

1726
02:25:32,890 --> 02:25:34,016
Over here.

1727
02:25:41,766 --> 02:25:45,361
``The blade and chalice
guarding o`er her gates.``

1728
02:25:45,737 --> 02:25:48,171
Pagan symbols for
male and female.

1729
02:25:50,174 --> 02:25:51,937
Fused as one.

1730
02:25:52,376 --> 02:25:54,469
As the pagans would have wanted.

1731
02:25:56,114 --> 02:25:57,843
We`re about to close, l`m afraid.

1732
02:26:04,088 --> 02:26:06,420
We`re just gonna be a moment.

1733
02:26:55,640 --> 02:26:56,937
Robert.

1734
02:27:30,141 --> 02:27:31,938
l`ve never seen that before.

1735
02:27:37,215 --> 02:27:39,547
The style is....

1736
02:27:41,052 --> 02:27:42,644
lt`s unmistakable.

1737
02:27:51,896 --> 02:27:54,160
These could have been painted by
Leonardo da Vinci.

1738
02:27:56,300 --> 02:27:59,394
``Adorned in masters`
loving art, she lies.``

1739
02:27:59,971 --> 02:28:05,773
``She rests at last
beneath the starry skies.``

1740
02:28:24,562 --> 02:28:26,257
The fleur-de-lis.

1741
02:29:17,348 --> 02:29:18,337
She was here.

1742
02:29:21,452 --> 02:29:23,010
Her sarcophagus.

1743
02:29:25,156 --> 02:29:26,748
Mary Magdalene.

1744
02:29:28,459 --> 02:29:30,484
The Holy Grail herself.

1745
02:29:32,063 --> 02:29:33,587
She was here.

1746
02:29:40,838 --> 02:29:45,002
With modern DNA testing,
those bones...

1747
02:29:45,209 --> 02:29:48,701
...could have shown definitive proof
of a bloodline.

1748
02:29:50,915 --> 02:29:52,542
Where did she go?

1749
02:29:53,584 --> 02:29:55,950
Did the Church finally get her?

1750
02:30:10,534 --> 02:30:13,059
This is incredible. Look at this.

1751
02:30:13,270 --> 02:30:16,569
Look at this. These records
go back thousands of years.

1752
02:30:17,842 --> 02:30:20,675
They date back
to the death of Christ.

1753
02:30:22,980 --> 02:30:26,347
Good God, could these
really be the Grail documents?

1754
02:30:48,406 --> 02:30:52,672
What did he want from us?
To find her sarcophagus?

1755
02:30:53,677 --> 02:30:56,373
How was l ever supposed
to figure all this out?

1756
02:30:56,814 --> 02:30:59,214
When you and your
grandfather fought...

1757
02:30:59,417 --> 02:31:02,113
...was it something about your past?

1758
02:31:03,954 --> 02:31:05,717
How could you know that?

1759
02:31:06,424 --> 02:31:09,154
About how your parents died?

1760
02:31:10,161 --> 02:31:11,822
Sophie?

1761
02:31:14,098 --> 02:31:16,328
lt was during primary school.

1762
02:31:17,935 --> 02:31:19,926
l was in his library.

1763
02:31:21,739 --> 02:31:23,229
Doing research.

1764
02:31:23,441 --> 02:31:26,069
I was trying to find out
about my family.

1765
02:31:26,277 --> 02:31:28,507
Sophie, where are you, princess?

1766
02:31:29,346 --> 02:31:31,644
l wanted to know about them.

1767
02:31:32,349 --> 02:31:34,340
But l couldn`t find any records.

1768
02:31:35,519 --> 02:31:37,419
Not of their death...

1769
02:31:38,889 --> 02:31:40,754
...not of the accident.

1770
02:31:41,425 --> 02:31:43,757
I`d asked him for as long
as I could remember...

1771
02:31:43,961 --> 02:31:45,258
...but he would never tell me.

1772
02:31:45,463 --> 02:31:47,124
l told you, no.

1773
02:31:49,600 --> 02:31:51,033
But why can`t l?

1774
02:31:51,402 --> 02:31:53,233
He stood over me...

1775
02:31:54,972 --> 02:31:56,997
...and he wouldn`t let me leave.

1776
02:31:57,208 --> 02:31:59,005
They`re dead. Dead and buried.

1777
02:31:59,543 --> 02:32:01,170
Never look for them, Sophie.

1778
02:32:01,479 --> 02:32:02,639
Promise me.

1779
02:32:04,148 --> 02:32:05,206
Swear it!

1780
02:32:05,983 --> 02:32:07,075
Swear it to me!

1781
02:32:17,761 --> 02:32:19,729
l kept my promise.

1782
02:32:23,367 --> 02:32:26,165
The neXt week he sent me
to boarding school.

1783
02:32:27,872 --> 02:32:31,239
One weekend
I came home unexpectedly.

1784
02:32:32,376 --> 02:32:35,174
And what I saw
my grandfather doing....

1785
02:32:36,147 --> 02:32:37,739
Some ritual.

1786
02:32:39,783 --> 02:32:41,341
I was so frightened.

1787
02:32:46,056 --> 02:32:48,217
We hardly ever spoke again.

1788
02:32:51,962 --> 02:32:56,990
Do you have any memories of your
grandfather before the accident?

1789
02:32:58,068 --> 02:33:00,263
Before your parents were killed?

1790
02:33:00,971 --> 02:33:03,531
Yeah. No. l don`t know.

1791
02:33:04,708 --> 02:33:05,800
Why?

1792
02:33:08,579 --> 02:33:10,945
Because l don`t think
he was your grandfather.

1793
02:33:30,434 --> 02:33:32,402
These are my parents.

1794
02:33:34,572 --> 02:33:35,903
My brother.

1795
02:33:37,608 --> 02:33:39,405
And this is you, isn`t it?

1796
02:33:44,381 --> 02:33:48,044
The paper says
the entire family was killed.

1797
02:33:48,552 --> 02:33:52,386
The mother, the father, the boy, 6...

1798
02:33:54,225 --> 02:33:56,489
...and the girl, 4.

1799
02:33:58,095 --> 02:34:02,691
But your name was never Saunière.
lt`s Saint-Clair.

1800
02:34:06,136 --> 02:34:08,468
lt`s one of the oldest families
in France.

1801
02:34:09,139 --> 02:34:12,870
lt`s from a line of the
Merovingian kings.

1802
02:34:21,485 --> 02:34:23,282
Royal blood.

1803
02:34:25,322 --> 02:34:26,914
l was so wrong.

1804
02:34:28,559 --> 02:34:32,859
Saunière didn`t want you to help guard
the secret of the Holy Grail.

1805
02:34:34,598 --> 02:34:35,895
Sophie...

1806
02:34:38,435 --> 02:34:40,562
...you are the secret.

1807
02:34:41,939 --> 02:34:44,407
You survived the accident.

1808
02:34:44,675 --> 02:34:47,303
lf it even was an accident.

1809
02:34:47,511 --> 02:34:49,445
The Priory found out.

1810
02:34:50,080 --> 02:34:53,243
Somehow they concealed
the fact that you were alive.

1811
02:34:53,851 --> 02:34:57,150
They hid you with the
Grand Master himself...

1812
02:34:57,688 --> 02:34:59,849
...who raised you as his own.

1813
02:35:00,924 --> 02:35:02,721
According to all of this...

1814
02:35:04,261 --> 02:35:05,888
...Princess Sophie...

1815
02:35:09,667 --> 02:35:11,134
...you are the heir.

1816
02:35:13,470 --> 02:35:15,335
The end of the bloodline.

1817
02:35:17,007 --> 02:35:20,272
You are the last living descendent...

1818
02:35:21,445 --> 02:35:23,276
...of Jesus Christ.

1819
02:36:08,759 --> 02:36:10,124
What is this?

1820
02:36:12,162 --> 02:36:13,390
Sophie?

1821
02:36:16,600 --> 02:36:17,692
Who are you?

1822
02:36:17,901 --> 02:36:20,369
There have been many names.

1823
02:36:20,904 --> 02:36:22,701
The keepers.

1824
02:36:23,574 --> 02:36:25,041
Guardians.

1825
02:36:25,442 --> 02:36:27,706
The Priory of Sion.

1826
02:36:28,078 --> 02:36:33,380
But to you, Sophie, we are friends
of the man who raised you:

1827
02:36:33,851 --> 02:36:35,443
Jacques Saunière.

1828
02:36:37,888 --> 02:36:43,190
He would have wanted you to know
that he loved you very much.

1829
02:36:44,128 --> 02:36:48,087
And that the Priory are here
to protect you now...

1830
02:36:48,298 --> 02:36:51,461
...as they have always
protected our family.

1831
02:36:54,037 --> 02:36:56,130
l gave you up once...

1832
02:36:56,940 --> 02:36:59,966
...knowing l might
never see you again.

1833
02:37:03,447 --> 02:37:05,347
l`m your grandmother, Sophie.

1834
02:37:06,550 --> 02:37:11,852
l have prayed for this moment
for a very long time.

1835
02:37:13,557 --> 02:37:15,684
Welcome home, child.

1836
02:37:39,750 --> 02:37:40,808
Hey.

1837
02:37:43,320 --> 02:37:44,878
No more strings.

1838
02:37:49,426 --> 02:37:52,827
His last breath to keep me safe.

1839
02:37:57,167 --> 02:38:01,365
She has some things
she wants to tell me.

1840
02:38:02,172 --> 02:38:04,538
About my family.

1841
02:38:10,914 --> 02:38:12,040
What will you do?

1842
02:38:13,183 --> 02:38:16,914
The legend will be revealed
when the heir reveals himself.

1843
02:38:17,721 --> 02:38:20,155
They just got the pronoun wrong.

1844
02:38:23,494 --> 02:38:25,189
She said when Saunière died...

1845
02:38:25,395 --> 02:38:29,161
...he took the location
of Mary`s sarcophagus with him.

1846
02:38:29,366 --> 02:38:33,302
So there`s no way to empirically prove
that l am related to her.

1847
02:38:35,472 --> 02:38:37,406
What would you do, Robert?

1848
02:38:38,375 --> 02:38:42,607
Okay, maybe there is no proof.
Maybe the Grail is lost forever.

1849
02:38:42,813 --> 02:38:47,045
But, Sophie, the only thing that
matters is what you believe.

1850
02:38:48,051 --> 02:38:51,077
History shows us
Jesus was an eXtraordinary man...

1851
02:38:51,288 --> 02:38:53,256
...a human inspiration. That`s it.

1852
02:38:54,091 --> 02:38:56,787
That`s all the evidence
has ever proved.

1853
02:38:58,328 --> 02:38:59,420
But...

1854
02:39:00,397 --> 02:39:02,262
...when l was a boy....

1855
02:39:04,668 --> 02:39:09,128
When l was down in that well
Teabing told you about...

1856
02:39:11,742 --> 02:39:14,506
...l thought l was going to die,
Sophie.

1857
02:39:16,480 --> 02:39:17,913
What l did...

1858
02:39:18,649 --> 02:39:20,014
...l prayed.

1859
02:39:21,518 --> 02:39:25,614
l prayed to Jesus to keep me alive...

1860
02:39:25,822 --> 02:39:27,551
...so l could see my parents again...

1861
02:39:27,758 --> 02:39:30,318
...so l could go to school again...

1862
02:39:30,761 --> 02:39:33,025
...so l could play with my dog.

1863
02:39:34,431 --> 02:39:37,730
Sometimes l wonder
if l wasn`t alone down there.

1864
02:39:39,636 --> 02:39:42,366
Why does it have to be
human or divine?

1865
02:39:42,573 --> 02:39:44,473
Maybe human is divine.

1866
02:39:45,776 --> 02:39:47,607
Why couldn`t Jesus
have been a father...

1867
02:39:47,811 --> 02:39:50,609
...and still been capable
of all those miracles?

1868
02:39:51,048 --> 02:39:53,573
Like turning water into wine?

1869
02:39:53,951 --> 02:39:57,580
Well, who knows?
His blood is your blood.

1870
02:39:57,788 --> 02:40:00,916
Maybe that junkie in the park
will never touch a drug again.

1871
02:40:01,525 --> 02:40:04,517
Maybe you healed my phobia
with your hands.

1872
02:40:04,728 --> 02:40:07,891
And maybe you`re
a knight on a Grail quest.

1873
02:40:10,567 --> 02:40:13,297
Well, here`s the question:

1874
02:40:14,071 --> 02:40:16,767
A living descendent
of Jesus Christ...

1875
02:40:18,308 --> 02:40:20,833
...would she destroy faith?

1876
02:40:21,411 --> 02:40:25,074
Or would she renew it?

1877
02:40:26,883 --> 02:40:30,114
So again l say, what matters
is what you believe.

1878
02:40:32,389 --> 02:40:33,686
Thank you.

1879
02:40:35,826 --> 02:40:37,054
For bringing me here.

1880
02:40:39,262 --> 02:40:41,753
For letting him choose you...

1881
02:40:42,466 --> 02:40:43,660
...Sir Robert.

1882
02:40:53,944 --> 02:40:54,911
You take care.

1883
02:40:56,513 --> 02:40:57,639
Yes.

1884
02:41:22,339 --> 02:41:23,465
Hey.

1885
02:41:36,453 --> 02:41:37,420
Nope.

1886
02:41:38,722 --> 02:41:40,986
Maybe l`ll do better with the wine.

1887
02:41:44,528 --> 02:41:45,893
Godspeed.

1888
02:42:44,654 --> 02:42:45,951
Bloodline.

1889
02:42:49,493 --> 02:42:50,858
Rose Line.

1890
02:42:57,634 --> 02:42:59,465
``Hides beneath the Rose.``

1891
02:44:58,255 --> 02:45:01,850
``The Holy Grail `neath
ancient Roslin waits.

1892
02:45:04,928 --> 02:45:08,329
Adorned in masters`
loving art, she lies.

1893
02:45:24,381 --> 02:45:28,010
The blade and chalice
guarding o`er her gates.

1894
02:46:07,524 --> 02:46:11,324
She rests at last
beneath starry skies. ``
