00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,583
1, 2 equals 3.

Aleph, Mem.

157
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:44,167
1, 40 equals 41 .
The sum of 3 and 41, 44.

00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,167
If you divide 144 into 233,

176
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:50,208
- the result approaches Theta.
- Theta?

177
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:56,625
Theta. The Greek symbol for the
golden ratio, the golden spiral.

178
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Wow.

179
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:03,500
I never saw that before.

180
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:06,583
That's like that series
you find in nature?

181
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:11,417
- Like the face of a sunflower?
- Wherever there are spirals.

182
00:17:11,542 --> 00:17:14,083

these crazy low picks,

then it spit out
this string of numbers.

226
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:33,292
I never saw anything like it.
And then it fries.

227
00:22:33,417 --> 00:22:36,083
- It crashed.
- You have a print out?

228
00:22:36,167 --> 00:22:38,708
- Of what?
- Of the picks, the number?

229
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:42,208
- I threw it out.
- What number did it spit out?

230
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,583
I don't know,
a string of digits.

231
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:47,292
- How many?
- I don't know.

232
00:22:47,417 --> 00:22:52,833
What is it, 100, 1 ,000, 216?
How many?

233
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:55,083
Probably around 200. Why?

234
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:59,708
I dealt with some bugs
back in my Pi days.

235
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:02,708
I wondered
if it was like one I ran into.

236
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:05,083
Have you met Archimedes?

237
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,375
The one with black spots. See?

238
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:13,750
You remember
Archimedes of Syracuse? Eh?

239
00:23:15,292 --> 00:23:19,958
The king asks Archimedes
to determine if a present

240
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:23,292
he has received
is actually solid gold.

241
00:23:23,417 --> 00:23:25,458
Unsolved problem at the time.

242
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:29,000
It tortures the great Greek
mathematician for weeks.

243
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:33,125
Insomnia haunts him and he
twists and turns in his bed

244
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:38,625
for nights on end. Finally,
his equally exhausted wife,

245
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,625
forced to share a bed
with this genius,

246
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:46,792
convinces him
to take a bath, to relax.

247
00:23:46,917 --> 00:23:53,042
While he's entering the tub,
he notices the bath water rise.

248
00:23:53,167 --> 00:23:58,625
Displacement -
a way to determine volume,

249
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:02,083
and thus a way
to determine density.

250
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:08,458
Weight over volume. And thus
Archimedes solves the problem.

251
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:11,750
He screams "Eureka!"
and he is so overwhelmed,

252
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:15,292
he runs naked through the
streets to the king's palace

253
00:24:15,417 --> 00:24:17,750
to report his discovery.

254
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:23,500
Now, what is the moral
of the story?

255
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:27,542
That a breakthrough will come.

256
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:32,375
Wrong! The point of the story
is the wife.

257
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,000
Listen to your wife,
she'll give you perspective.

258
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:37,125
Meaning, you need a break.

259
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:40,458
You must take a bath
or you'll get nowhere.

260
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:44,042
There will be no order,
only chaos.

261
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:50,625
Go home, Max,
and you take a bath.

262
00:24:55,833 --> 00:24:57,417

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,458

264

Oh, my God.

265
00:25:48,208 --> 00:25:50,625
Six and a half.

267
00:25:53,958 --> 00:25:54,875

268
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,292
The paper, please.

269
00:26:42,792 --> 00:26:48,792
Mr Cohen? Perfect timing.
I was going to head home.

270
00:26:48,917 --> 00:26:52,125
- Who are you?
- Marcy Dawson. We were meeting.

271
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,167
It's really not...

272
00:26:53,292 --> 00:26:56,250
It's such a pleasure
to finally meet you.

273
00:26:56,375 --> 00:26:58,042
- I studied your paper...
- Excuse me.

274
00:26:58,167 --> 00:27:00,333
- Let's take my car.
- I can't.

275
00:27:00,458 --> 00:27:01,333
Mr Cohen...

276
00:27:33,792 --> 00:27:35,792
Yes!

277
00:27:52,167 --> 00:27:56,667
I just threw out something.
I didn't realise I needed it.

278
00:27:56,792 --> 00:28:00,625
Just a print-out.
I lost my data.

279
00:28:10,708 --> 00:28:14,750
Whoa! I'm sorry. Max.
How're you doing? Lenny Meyer.

280
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:17,208
- Where you going?
- Up there.

281
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:20,292
You got five minutes?
Do you wanna try Tefillin?

282
00:28:20,417 --> 00:28:23,958
- Not now.
- I've a car to go to the Shul.

283
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:26,792
- You got a car?
- That's my friend, Ephraim.

284
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:30,792
- Let's go.
- Great.

285
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:34,500
When you said you're Max Cohen,

286
00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:37,250
I didn't realise
you were the Max Cohen.

287
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:41,708
Your work's revolutionary.
It's inspired the work we do.

288
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:44,792
- It has?
- Very much so.

289
00:28:44,917 --> 00:28:49,458
The only difference is, we're
not looking at the stock market.

290
00:28:49,583 --> 00:28:51,542
Go ahead.
Wrap that round your hand.

291
00:28:51,667 --> 00:28:54,333
We're searching for a pattern
in the Torah.

292
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:56,792
- What kind?
- We're not sure.

293
00:28:56,917 --> 00:28:59,458
All we know is
it's 216 digits long.

294
00:28:59,583 --> 00:29:03,667
- OK, stand up, please, Max.
- 216?

295
00:29:03,792 --> 00:29:07,667
That's right. You've gotta
be quiet now. Stand up.

296
00:29:07,792 --> 00:29:10,792
- 216?
- Shh. This goes on your head.

297
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:15,625
Look at me, Max. Right here.

298
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:18,583
There you go.

299
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:24,333
All right. Now, we'll say
a prayer together.

300
00:29:24,458 --> 00:29:28,792
Repeat after me: Shma Yisroel.

301
00:29:28,917 --> 00:29:31,792
- Shma Yisroel.
- Right.

302
00:29:31,917 --> 00:29:35,750
- Adenoi Eloihenu.
- Adenoi Eloihenu.

303
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:39,667
- Adenoi Echod.
- Adenoi Echod.

304
00:29:42,292 --> 00:29:45,417
Now, what's up, Max?

305
00:29:45,542 --> 00:29:49,625
What is this 216 number, Sol?

306
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,625
Excuse me?

307
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:53,875
You asked me if I'd seen
a 216-digit number.

308
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,167
Oh, yeah. You mean the bug.

309
00:29:59,292 --> 00:30:02,250
I ran into it working on Pi.

310
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:07,000
- What do you mean ran into it?
- Max, what's this about?

311
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:09,958
There are these religious Jews
I've been talking to.

312
00:30:10,083 --> 00:30:11,917
Religious Jews?

313
00:30:12,042 --> 00:30:14,083
Yeah, Hasids,
the guys with beards.

314
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:15,125
I know them.

315
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:19,167
I know one in a coffee shop.
He's a number theorist.

316
00:30:19,292 --> 00:30:21,500
The Torah is his data set.

317
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:25,125
He says they're after
a 216-digit number in the Torah.

318
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:28,750
Come on, it's just coincidence.

319
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:30,333
There's something else, though.

320
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:32,042
What?

321
00:30:32,167 --> 00:30:34,250
You remember those weird
stock picks?

322
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:38,417
- Yesterday's stock picks? Yes.
- They were correct.

323
00:30:38,542 --> 00:30:42,542
I got two picks on the nose.
Smack on the nose, Sol.

324
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,458
Something's going on.

325
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:50,167
It has to do with that number.
There's an answer in it.

326
00:30:50,292 --> 00:30:55,208
Max... Come with me.

327
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:58,000
The ancient Japanese
considered the Go board

328
00:30:58,125 --> 00:31:00,875
to be a microcosm
of the universe.

329
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,125
Although, when it's empty,
it appears simple and ordered,

330
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:10,375
the possibilities of gameplay
are endless.

331
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:15,208
No two Go games are alike,
just like snowflakes.

332
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:19,208
So, the Go board
actually represents

333
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:25,125
an extremely complex
and chaotic universe.

334
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:28,958
And that's the truth
of our world, Max.

335
00:31:29,083 --> 00:31:32,125
It can't be
easily summed up with math.

336
00:31:32,292 --> 00:31:35,375
There is no simple pattern.

337
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,792
But as the game progresses, the
possibilities become smaller.

338
00:31:38,958 --> 00:31:42,083
The board takes on order.
Soon, every move's predictable.

339
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:43,167
So?

340
00:31:43,292 --> 00:31:47,042
So maybe, even though
we're not aware of it,

341
00:31:47,167 --> 00:31:53,042
there is a pattern, an order
underlying every Go game.

342
00:31:53,167 --> 00:31:56,417
Maybe it's like the pattern
in the stock market?

343
00:31:56,542 --> 00:31:59,375
The Torah? This 216 number?

344
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,208
- It's insanity.

Max, you have
to give us the number.

601
01:08:48,042 --> 01:08:50,542
What is it?

602
01:08:54,708 --> 01:08:57,667
The Talmud tells us
it began 2,000 years ago,

603
01:08:57,792 --> 01:08:59,958
when the Romans destroyed
the second temple.

604
01:09:00,083 --> 01:09:02,625
What is this?

605
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:05,875
Max, you'll understand
if you listen.

606
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,458
The Romans also destroyed
our priesthood, the Cohanim.

607
01:09:09,583 --> 01:09:13,875
And with their deaths, they
destroyed our greatest secret.

608
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,875
In the centre of the temple
was the heart of Jewish life,

609
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,958
the holy of holies.

610
01:09:21,083 --> 01:09:25,417
It was the earthly residence
of our God.

611
01:09:25,542 --> 01:09:29,000
The one God.

612
01:09:29,125 --> 01:09:31,417
It housed the Ark
of the Tabernacle,

613
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:34,292
which stored the original 10
Commandments

614
01:09:34,417 --> 01:09:38,042
which God gave to Moses.

615
01:09:38,167 --> 01:09:42,500
Only one man was allowed
to enter this holy of holies

616
01:09:42,625 --> 01:09:46,917
on one day, the holiest day
of the year, Yom Kippur.

617
01:09:47,042 --> 01:09:48,792
On the Day of Atonement,

618
01:09:48,917 --> 01:09:50,958
all of lsrael
would descend upon Jerusalem

619
01:09:51,083 --> 01:09:55,083
to watch the High Priest,
the Cohen Godul,

620
01:09:55,208 --> 01:09:58,083
make his trip
to the holy of holies.

621
01:09:58,208 --> 01:10:02,375
If the High Priest was pure,
he would emerge moments later

622
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:05,583
and we'd have a prosperous year.

623
01:10:05,708 --> 01:10:09,042
It meant we were one year closer
to the Messianic age.

624
01:10:09,167 --> 01:10:15,542
But, if he was impure,
he would die instantly

625
01:10:15,667 --> 01:10:19,625
and it meant we were doomed.

626
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:23,083
The High Priest
had one ritual to perform there.

627
01:10:23,208 --> 01:10:26,042
He had to intone a single word.

628
01:10:26,167 --> 01:10:28,542
Yeah?

629
01:10:28,667 --> 01:10:32,750
That word was
the true name of God.

630
01:10:34,917 --> 01:10:36,292
So?

631
01:10:36,417 --> 01:10:40,292
The true name,
which only the Cohanim knew,

632
01:10:40,417 --> 01:10:43,458
was 216 letters long.

633
01:10:48,708 --> 01:10:51,542
Are you telling me that...

634
01:10:51,667 --> 01:10:56,375
That the number in my head
is the true name of God.

635
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:59,833
Yes! It's the key
to the Messianic age.

636
01:10:59,958 --> 01:11:02,792
It will take us closer
to the Garden of Eden.

637
01:11:02,917 --> 01:11:05,750
As the temple burnt,
the Talmud tells us

638
01:11:05,875 --> 01:11:08,375
the High Priest
walked into the flames.

639
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:11,333
He took the key to the top
of the building,

640
01:11:11,458 --> 01:11:15,542
the heavens opened
and received the key

641
01:11:15,667 --> 01:11:18,708
from the priest's
outstretched hand.

642
01:11:18,833 --> 01:11:21,958
We have been looking
for that key ever since.

643
01:11:22,083 --> 01:11:25,917
And you may have found it.

644
01:11:28,125 --> 01:11:30,958
That's what happened.

645
01:11:34,375 --> 01:11:36,417
I saw God.

646
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:41,958
No. You are not pure. You cannot
see God unless you are pure.

No... I saw everything.

648

You saw nothing, only a glimpse.
There's so much more.

649
01:11:50,917 --> 01:11:56,000
We can unlock the door
and show God we're pure again.

You're not pure.
How are you pure? I found it!

[Devi] Stay with me, Max.

694
01:17:05,542 --> 01:17:08,375
Max.

695
01:17:15,833 --> 01:17:17,542
No!

696
01:17:17,667 --> 01:17:21,542
