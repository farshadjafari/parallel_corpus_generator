1
00:01:51,094 --> 00:01:52,857
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

2
00:01:54,230 --> 00:02:00,601
Here ye, here ye, 10 minutes to go
till Van Dort's wedding rehearsal.

3
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,319
Watch it!

4
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:29,396
<i>- It's a beautiful day</i>
<i>- It's a rather nice day</i>

5
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,727
<i>A day for a glorious wedding</i>

6
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:34,665
<i>A rehearsal, my dear</i>
<i>To be perfectly clear</i>

7
00:02:34,838 --> 00:02:37,238
<i>A rehearsal for a glorious wedding</i>

8
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:40,342
<i>Assuming nothing happens</i>
<i>That we don't really know</i>

9
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,910
<i>That nothing unexpected</i>
<i>Interferes with the show</i>

10
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,479
<i>And that's why everything</i>
<i>Every last little thing</i>

11
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:50,481
<i>Every single, tiny, microscopic little thing</i>
<i>Must go</i>

12
00:02:50,653 --> 00:02:53,554
<i>- According to plan</i>
<i>- Our son will be married</i>

13
00:02:53,723 --> 00:02:55,816
<i>- According to plan</i>
<i>- Our family carried</i>

14
00:02:55,992 --> 00:02:59,792
<i>Elevated to the heights of society</i>

15
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,587
<i>- To the costume balls</i>
<i>- In the hallowed halls</i>

16
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:04,926
<i>Rubbing elbows with the finest</i>

17
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:07,729
<i>Having crumpets with Her Highness</i>

18
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:10,696
<i>We'll be there, we'll be seen</i>
<i>Having tea with the queen</i>

19
00:03:10,874 --> 00:03:14,503
<i>We'll forget everything</i>
<i>That we've ever, ever been</i>

20
00:03:16,512 --> 00:03:19,879
- Blimey! It's my dress is caught.
- Begging your pardon, ma'am.

21
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:23,507
- Come on, dear.
- It's not me. It's my dress is caught.

22
00:03:23,686 --> 00:03:26,519
Where is Victor? We might be late.

23
00:03:31,494 --> 00:03:33,428
Fish merchants.

24
00:03:33,863 --> 00:03:36,559
<i>- It's a terrible day</i>
<i>- Now, don't be that way</i>

25
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:39,258
<i>It's a terrible day for a wedding</i>

26
00:03:39,435 --> 00:03:42,427
<i>It's a sad, sad state of affairs we're in</i>

27
00:03:42,605 --> 00:03:45,802
<i>That has led to this ominous wedding</i>

28
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,136
<i>How could our family have come to this?</i>

29
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:51,302
<i>To marry off our daughter</i>
<i>To the nouveau riche</i>

30
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,971
<i>- They're so common</i>
<i>- So coarse</i>

31
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:56,949
<i>- Oh, it couldn't be worse</i>
<i>- Couldn't be worse? I'm afraid I disagree</i>

32
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,782
<i>They could be land-rich,</i>
<i>Bankrupt aristocracy</i>

33
00:03:59,956 --> 00:04:01,355
<i>Without a penny to their name</i>

34
00:04:01,524 --> 00:04:04,925
<i>Just like you and me</i>

35
00:04:05,094 --> 00:04:06,857
Oh, dear.

36
00:04:07,463 --> 00:04:10,330
<i>And that's why everything</i>
<i>Every last little thing</i>

37
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,267
<i>Every single, tiny, microscopic little thing</i>
<i>Must go</i>

38
00:04:17,707 --> 00:04:20,505
<i>- According to plan</i>
<i>- Our daughter will wed</i>

39
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,578
<i>- According to plan</i>
<i>- Our family led</i>

40
00:04:23,746 --> 00:04:28,547
<i>From the depths of deepest poverty</i>

41
00:04:29,485 --> 00:04:32,477
<i>- To the noble realm</i>
<i>- Of our ancestry</i>

42
00:04:32,655 --> 00:04:35,488
<i>And who would have guessed</i>
<i>In a million years</i>

43
00:04:35,658 --> 00:04:38,855
<i>- That our daughter with a face</i>
<i>- Of an otter in disgrace</i>

44
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:43,556
<i>Would provide our ticket</i>
<i>To a rightful place</i>

45
00:04:50,073 --> 00:04:51,438
Oh, Hildegarde.

46
00:04:51,607 --> 00:04:55,236
What if Victor and I
don't like each other?

47
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:58,873
As if that has anything
to do with marriage.

48
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:02,677
Do you suppose your father and I
like each other?

49
00:05:02,852 --> 00:05:04,376
Surely you must a little?

50
00:05:05,121 --> 00:05:06,486
- Of course not.
- Of course not.

51
00:05:06,656 --> 00:05:08,590
Get those corsets laced properly.

52
00:05:08,758 --> 00:05:11,625
I can hear you speak without gasping.

53
00:05:17,967 --> 00:05:20,299
You've certainly hooked a winner
this time, Victor.

54
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:24,236
- Now, all you have to do is reel her in.
- I'm already reeling, Mother.

55
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:27,535
Shouldn't Victoria Everglot
be marrying a lord or something?

56
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:31,043
Oh, nonsense! We're every bit
as good as the Everglots.

57
00:05:31,214 --> 00:05:35,583
I always knew I deserved better
than a fish merchant's life.

58
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,050
But I've never even spoken to her.

59
00:05:38,221 --> 00:05:40,815
Well, at least we have that
in our favor.

60
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:44,984
Mayhew! Silence that blasted coughing.

61
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,994
Marriage is a partnership,
a little tit for tat.

62
00:05:54,504 --> 00:05:56,938
You'd think a lifetime watching us...

63
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:59,802
<i>Might have taught her that</i>

64
00:05:59,976 --> 00:06:03,104
<i>- Might have taught her that</i>
<i>- Everything must be perfect</i>

65
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,112
<i>- Everything must be perfect</i>
<i>- Everything must be perfect</i>

66
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:07,943
<i>Perfect</i>
<i>That's why everything</i>

67
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,516
<i>Every last little thing</i>

68
00:06:09,685 --> 00:06:13,849
<i>Every single, tiny, microscopic little thing</i>
<i>Must go</i>

69
00:06:14,023 --> 00:06:17,982
<i>According to plan</i>

70
00:06:20,196 --> 00:06:21,686
Look at the way you're standing.

71
00:06:21,864 --> 00:06:24,628
You look like you got rickets
or something...

72
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:38,376
Oh, my goodness. Oh, such grandeur!
Such impeccable taste!

73
00:06:38,548 --> 00:06:40,413
Oh, beautiful, innit?

74
00:06:42,552 --> 00:06:44,179
It's not as big as our place, dear.

75
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:50,056
- Bit shabby really, isn't it?
- Shut up.

76
00:06:50,226 --> 00:06:52,990
Lord and Lady Everglot...

77
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:56,825
...Mr. And Mrs. Van Dort.

78
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,490
Why, you must be Miss Victoria.

79
00:07:00,136 --> 00:07:04,368
Yes, I must say, you don't look a day
over 20. No. Oh, yes.

80
00:07:05,441 --> 00:07:08,171
Smile, darling, smile.

81
00:07:12,748 --> 00:07:17,310
Well, hello. What a pleasure.
Welcome to our home.

82
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,082
Thank you.

83
00:07:19,255 --> 00:07:22,588
We'll be taking tea
in the west drawing room.

84
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,620
Oh, do come this way,
it's just through there.

85
00:07:26,796 --> 00:07:31,028
Oh, I love what you've done with the place.
Who is your decorator?

86
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,225
Nice tiles, shame about the drapes.

87
00:07:33,402 --> 00:07:36,894
My husband says such foolish things.
Ignore him.

88
00:07:37,406 --> 00:07:39,499
Yes, it's usually best.

89
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:11,491
- Do forgive me.
- You play beautifully.

90
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:16,934
I... I... I do apologize, Miss Everglot.
How rude of me to... Well...

91
00:09:17,673 --> 00:09:19,163
Excuse me.

92
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,873
Mother won't let me near the piano.

93
00:09:23,613 --> 00:09:26,878
Music is improper for a young lady.

94
00:09:27,049 --> 00:09:28,607
Too passionate, she says.

95
00:09:28,784 --> 00:09:33,585
If I may ask, Miss Everglot...

96
00:09:33,756 --> 00:09:36,054
...where is your chaperon?

97
00:09:36,592 --> 00:09:40,926
Perhaps, in...
In view of the circumstances...

98
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:44,261
...you could call me Victoria.

99
00:09:44,734 --> 00:09:46,395
Yes, of course. Well...

100
00:09:47,203 --> 00:09:50,639
- Victoria...
- Yes, Victor.

101
00:09:51,874 --> 00:09:54,536
Tomorrow, we are to be m...

102
00:09:56,145 --> 00:09:57,476
M... M...

103
00:09:57,913 --> 00:10:02,043
- Married.
- Yes. Married.

104
00:10:03,486 --> 00:10:07,547
Since I was a child, I've...
I've dreamt of my wedding day.

105
00:10:08,157 --> 00:10:11,092
I always hoped to find someone
I was deeply in love with.

106
00:10:11,627 --> 00:10:14,460
Someone to spend
the rest of my life with.

107
00:10:14,997 --> 00:10:17,795
- Silly, isn't it?
- Yes, silly.

108
00:10:18,334 --> 00:10:21,269
No. No, not at all, no.

109
00:10:21,904 --> 00:10:24,429
Oh, dear. I'm sorry.

110
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:33,041
What impropriety is this?

111
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,206
You shouldn't be alone together.

112
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:39,912
Here it is, one minute before 5,
and you're not at the rehearsal.

113
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:44,549
Pastor Galswells is waiting.
Come at once.

114
00:10:47,263 --> 00:10:50,164
<i>Master Van Dort,</i>
<i>from the beginning. Again.</i>

115
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:55,600
"With this hand,
I will lift your sorrows.

116
00:10:55,938 --> 00:11:01,808
Your cup will never empty,
for I will be your wine.

117
00:11:01,977 --> 00:11:08,007
With this candle,
I will light your way in darkness.

118
00:11:08,184 --> 00:11:13,247
With this ring, I ask you to be mine."

119
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,855
- Let's try it again.
- Yes. Yes, sir.

120
00:11:18,027 --> 00:11:20,427
With this candle...

121
00:11:22,832 --> 00:11:24,663
This candle...

122
00:11:26,135 --> 00:11:27,762
This candle.

123
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:32,563
- Shall I get up there and do it for him?
- Don't get all aflutter, dear.

124
00:11:38,381 --> 00:11:40,508
With this candle...

125
00:11:42,385 --> 00:11:43,613
Continue!

126
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:47,886
Get the door, Emil.

127
00:11:48,657 --> 00:11:52,286
Let's just pick it up at the candle bit.

128
00:11:54,363 --> 00:11:56,729
A Lord Barkis, sir.

129
00:12:00,569 --> 00:12:02,935
I haven't a head for dates.

130
00:12:03,105 --> 00:12:06,097
Apparently,
I'm a day early for the ceremony.

131
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:11,405
- Is he from your side of the family?
- I can't recall.

132
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:14,208
Emil, a seat for Lord Barkis.

133
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,384
Do carry on.

134
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:26,960
Let's try it again, shall we,
Master Van Dort?

135
00:12:27,129 --> 00:12:31,327
- Yes. Yes, sir. Certainly.
- Right.

136
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,401
Right. Oh, right!

137
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:38,734
- With this... This...
- Hand.

138
00:12:38,908 --> 00:12:41,809
With this hand...

139
00:12:41,977 --> 00:12:43,467
...I... With...

140
00:12:43,646 --> 00:12:45,910
Three steps, three!

141
00:12:46,081 --> 00:12:50,541
Can you not count? Do you not wish
to be married, Master Van Dort?

142
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:52,414
- No! No.
- You do not?

143
00:12:52,588 --> 00:12:56,581
No! I meant, no,
I do not not wish to be married.

144
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:59,159
That is, I want very much to...

145
00:12:59,328 --> 00:13:03,594
Pay attention! Have you
even remembered to bring the ring?

146
00:13:03,766 --> 00:13:06,394
The ring? Yes. Of course.

147
00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:12,203
- Dropping the ring.
- Oh, no, he's dropped the ring!

148
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:16,105
- This boy doesn't want to get married.
- How disgraceful!

149
00:13:16,512 --> 00:13:18,173
Excuse me. Got it!

150
00:13:21,851 --> 00:13:24,081
Out of the way, you ninny.

151
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:29,584
Oh, dear! Oh, my! Giddy on, there's a
woman on fire! Help! Emergency!

152
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:35,626
- Oh, I hope it doesn't stain.
- Stop fanning it, you fool.

153
00:13:38,968 --> 00:13:43,564
- Get a bucket, get a bucket.
- I'm on my way, dear. Yes. Oh, dear!

154
00:13:51,614 --> 00:13:57,519
Enough! This wedding cannot take place
until he is properly prepared.

155
00:13:59,121 --> 00:14:04,650
Young man, learn your vows.

156
00:14:19,008 --> 00:14:23,342
Well, he's quite the catch, isn't he?

157
00:14:38,093 --> 00:14:39,788
Oh, Victoria.

158
00:14:40,262 --> 00:14:44,198
She must think I'm such a fool.
This day couldn't get any worse.

159
00:14:44,366 --> 00:14:50,464
Hear ye, hear ye! Rehearsal in ruins
as Van Dort boy causes chaos!

160
00:14:51,574 --> 00:14:55,533
Fishy fiancé could be canned!

161
00:14:55,711 --> 00:15:01,377
Everglots all fired up
as Van Dort disaster ruins rehearsal!

162
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,545
It really shouldn't be all that difficult.

163
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:07,882
It's just a few simple vows.

164
00:15:08,057 --> 00:15:12,118
With this hand, I will take your wine.

165
00:15:12,294 --> 00:15:13,693
No.

166
00:15:14,964 --> 00:15:16,625
With this hand...

167
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:18,460
...I will cup your...

168
00:15:18,634 --> 00:15:20,192
Oh, goodness, no.

169
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,268
With this...

170
00:15:24,773 --> 00:15:26,331
With this...

171
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:29,068
With this candle, I will...

172
00:15:30,813 --> 00:15:32,337
I will...

173
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,142
I will set your mother on fire.

174
00:15:37,052 --> 00:15:38,747
Oh, it's no use.

175
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:55,929
With this hand,
I will lift your sorrows.

176
00:15:56,105 --> 00:16:00,769
Your cup will never empty,
for I will be your wine.

177
00:16:02,478 --> 00:16:03,740
Mrs. Everglot.

178
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,610
You look ravishing this evening.

179
00:16:07,449 --> 00:16:12,546
What's that, Mr. Everglot?
Call you "Dad"? If you insist, sir.

180
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:17,215
With this candle,
I will light your way in darkness.

181
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,387
With this ring...

182
00:16:20,162 --> 00:16:23,757
...I ask you to be mine.

183
00:17:17,219 --> 00:17:18,413
I do.

184
00:18:47,075 --> 00:18:50,044
You may kiss the bride.

185
00:18:57,085 --> 00:19:00,248
- A new arrival.
- He must've fainted.

186
00:19:00,422 --> 00:19:03,220
- Are you all right?
- What..? What happened?

187
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,452
By Jove, man. Looks like
we've got ourselves a breather.

188
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:09,762
- Does he have a dead brother?
- He's still soft.

189
00:19:12,768 --> 00:19:14,395
A toast, then.

190
00:19:20,108 --> 00:19:21,700
To the newlyweds.

191
00:19:21,877 --> 00:19:23,105
Newlyweds?

192
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:28,175
In the woods,
you said your vows so perfectly.

193
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,942
I did?

194
00:19:30,118 --> 00:19:31,551
I did.

195
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,950
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

196
00:19:35,991 --> 00:19:39,017
Coming through, coming through.

197
00:19:39,194 --> 00:19:42,061
My name is Paul, I am the head waiter.

198
00:19:43,131 --> 00:19:46,191
I will be creating your wedding feast.

199
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,801
Wedding feast! I'm salivating.

200
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:50,999
Maggots.

201
00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:55,501
Keep away!

202
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:04,149
I've got a...
I've got a dwarf.

203
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:07,618
And I'm not afraid to use him.
I want some questions. Now!

204
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:11,748
- Answers. I think you mean "answers."
- Thank you, yes, answers.

205
00:20:11,927 --> 00:20:15,522
I need answers.
What's going on here? Where am I?

206
00:20:15,697 --> 00:20:16,823
Who are you?

207
00:20:16,999 --> 00:20:20,366
Well, that's kind of a long story.

208
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:23,134
What a story it is.

209
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,866
A tragic tale of romance, passion...

210
00:20:27,042 --> 00:20:28,839
...and murder most foul.

211
00:20:29,011 --> 00:20:30,603
This is gonna be good.

212
00:20:32,714 --> 00:20:34,375
Hit it, boys.

213
00:20:45,027 --> 00:20:48,622
<i>Hey, give me a listen</i>
<i>You corpses of cheer</i>

214
00:20:48,797 --> 00:20:51,527
<i>At least those of you</i>
<i>Who still got an ear</i>

215
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,498
<i>I'll tell you a story</i>
<i>Make a skeleton cry</i>

216
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:58,162
<i>Of our own jubiliciously</i>
<i>Lovely Corpse Bride</i>

217
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,740
<i>Die, die, we all pass away</i>

218
00:21:00,909 --> 00:21:03,673
<i>But don't wear a frown</i>
<i>Because it's really okay</i>

219
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,370
<i>You might try and hide</i>
<i>And you might try and pray</i>

220
00:21:06,548 --> 00:21:09,642
<i>But we all end up</i>
<i>The remains of the day</i>

221
00:21:10,886 --> 00:21:12,217
That's right.

222
00:21:15,057 --> 00:21:18,549
<i>Well, our girl was a beauty</i>
<i>Known for miles around</i>

223
00:21:18,727 --> 00:21:21,662
<i>When a mysterious stranger</i>
<i>Came into town</i>

224
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:24,458
<i>He was plenty good-looking</i>
<i>But down on his cash</i>

225
00:21:24,633 --> 00:21:27,534
<i>And our poor little baby</i>
<i>She fell hard and fast</i>

226
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,536
<i>When her daddy said no</i>
<i>She just couldn't cope</i>

227
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,266
<i>So our lovers came up</i>
<i>With a plan to elope</i>

228
00:21:33,976 --> 00:21:36,410
<i>Die, die, we all pass away</i>

229
00:21:36,578 --> 00:21:39,672
<i>But don't wear a frown</i>
<i>Because it's really okay</i>

230
00:21:39,848 --> 00:21:42,373
<i>You might try and hide</i>
<i>And you might try and pray</i>

231
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:45,714
<i>But we all end up</i>
<i>The remains of the day</i>

232
00:22:02,504 --> 00:22:03,994
That's right.

233
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:08,236
Okay. Oh, yeah.
Come on, boys, pick it up.

234
00:22:09,111 --> 00:22:12,171
Yeah. Like it.

235
00:22:12,347 --> 00:22:14,247
Okay, Chancy, take it.

236
00:22:16,485 --> 00:22:17,747
Yeah.

237
00:22:27,396 --> 00:22:28,954
Yeah!

238
00:22:32,901 --> 00:22:34,801
That's nice.

239
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:39,403
<i>So they conjured up a plan</i>
<i>To meet late at night</i>

240
00:22:39,574 --> 00:22:41,940
<i>They told not a soul</i>
<i>Kept the whole thing tight</i>

241
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,635
<i>Now, her mother's wedding dress</i>
<i>Fit like a glove</i>

242
00:22:44,813 --> 00:22:47,373
<i>You don't need much</i>
<i>When you're really in love</i>

243
00:22:47,549 --> 00:22:49,881
<i>Except for a few things</i>
<i>Or so I'm told</i>

244
00:22:50,052 --> 00:22:52,646
<i>Like the family jewels</i>
<i>And a satchel of gold</i>

245
00:22:52,821 --> 00:22:55,312
<i>Then next to the graveyard</i>
<i>By the old oak tree</i>

246
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:57,754
<i>On a dark foggy night</i>
<i>At a quarter to 3</i>

247
00:22:57,926 --> 00:23:01,362
<i>She was ready to go</i>
<i>But where was he?</i>

248
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,361
<i>And then?</i>

249
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,463
<i>- She waited</i>
<i>- And then?</i>

250
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:08,501
<i>- There in the shadows, was it her man?</i>
<i>- And then?</i>

251
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:12,106
<i>- Her little heart beat so loud</i>
<i>- And then?</i>

252
00:23:12,574 --> 00:23:16,408
<i>And then, baby, everything went black</i>

253
00:23:16,878 --> 00:23:19,904
<i>Now, when she opened her eyes</i>
<i>She was dead as dust</i>

254
00:23:20,082 --> 00:23:22,949
<i>Her jewels were missing</i>
<i>And her heart was bust</i>

255
00:23:23,118 --> 00:23:25,678
<i>So she made a vow</i>
<i>Lying under that tree</i>

256
00:23:25,854 --> 00:23:28,652
<i>That she'd wait for her true love</i>
<i>To come set her free</i>

257
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:31,657
<i>Always waiting for someone</i>
<i>To ask for her hand</i>

258
00:23:32,294 --> 00:23:35,161
<i>Then out of the blue</i>
<i>Comes this groovy young man</i>

259
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:38,060
<i>Who vows forever</i>
<i>To be by her side</i>

260
00:23:38,233 --> 00:23:42,067
<i>And that's the story</i>
<i>Of our Corpse Bride</i>

261
00:23:42,237 --> 00:23:44,000
<i>Die, die, we all pass away</i>

262
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,936
<i>But don't wear a frown,</i>
<i>Because it's really okay</i>

263
00:23:47,109 --> 00:23:49,907
<i>You might try and hide</i>
<i>And you might try and pray</i>

264
00:23:50,078 --> 00:23:55,675
<i>But we all end up</i>
<i>The remains of the day</i>

265
00:23:56,151 --> 00:23:57,448
Yeah.

266
00:24:09,131 --> 00:24:11,793
Victoria, come away from the window.

267
00:24:13,068 --> 00:24:15,093
Oh, I'm sure he'll be back shortly.

268
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:18,467
He's terrified of the dark.
In fact, when he was a boy...

269
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,701
...he used to wet his combinations
regularly, didn't he, William?

270
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,072
Enter.

271
00:24:27,949 --> 00:24:32,045
Lord Barkis.
I trust the room is to your liking.

272
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,781
Thank you,
you are a most gracious hostess.

273
00:24:35,957 --> 00:24:42,089
Which is why it pains me
to be the bearer of such bad news.

274
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:49,863
Would you care
to repeat tonight's headline for us?

275
00:24:50,038 --> 00:24:52,029
Hear ye, hear ye!

276
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:56,800
Victor Van Dort seen this night on the
bridge in the arms of a mystery woman!

277
00:24:56,978 --> 00:25:01,438
The dark-haired temptress and Master
Van Dort slipped away into the night!

278
00:25:01,616 --> 00:25:03,481
And now, the weather.
Scattered showers...

279
00:25:03,652 --> 00:25:06,120
Enough! That will be all.

280
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,617
Mystery woman?
He doesn't even know any women!

281
00:25:12,794 --> 00:25:14,853
Or so you thought.

282
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:18,130
Do call for me
if you need my assistance...

283
00:25:19,501 --> 00:25:21,366
...in any way.

284
00:25:22,871 --> 00:25:25,806
Good heavens, Finis,
what should we do?

285
00:25:25,974 --> 00:25:27,464
Fetch me musket.

286
00:25:27,642 --> 00:25:29,075
William, do something.

287
00:25:29,244 --> 00:25:31,769
The town crier
probably just had a slow news day.

288
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,745
You know how it is,
you need a little something to cry about.

289
00:25:34,916 --> 00:25:39,410
Regardless, we are one groom short
for the wedding tomorrow.

290
00:25:39,588 --> 00:25:42,751
Not to mention
the financial implications.

291
00:25:42,924 --> 00:25:45,722
A most scandalous embarrassment
for us all.

292
00:25:45,894 --> 00:25:49,330
Oh, give us a chance to find him,
we beg of you.

293
00:25:49,497 --> 00:25:53,331
- Just give us until dawn.
- Very well. Till dawn.

294
00:25:54,035 --> 00:25:57,493
Victor, darling, where are you?

295
00:25:57,939 --> 00:26:01,602
<i>If you ask me,</i>
<i>your boyfriend is kind of jumpy.</i>

296
00:26:01,776 --> 00:26:04,176
He's not my boyfriend,
he's my husband.

297
00:26:04,346 --> 00:26:06,780
Victor, where have you gone?

298
00:26:07,115 --> 00:26:08,810
I'll keep an eye out for him.

299
00:26:09,284 --> 00:26:10,273
Victor?

300
00:26:14,522 --> 00:26:17,514
There he goes, there he goes!
He's... He's getting away!

301
00:26:17,692 --> 00:26:19,751
Quick, quick, after him!

302
00:26:19,928 --> 00:26:21,156
Victor.

303
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:27,824
Thank you.

304
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,568
Victor!

305
00:26:30,105 --> 00:26:32,096
Where are you?

306
00:26:34,109 --> 00:26:35,633
Victor?

307
00:26:36,311 --> 00:26:38,336
Where have you gone?

308
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,440
Married, huh? I'm a widow.

309
00:26:41,616 --> 00:26:44,414
Oh, how rude. He went that way!

310
00:26:46,121 --> 00:26:47,816
Victor.

311
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:50,853
Victor, darling.

312
00:26:52,394 --> 00:26:56,091
Please. There's been a mistake.
I'm not dead.

313
00:26:59,801 --> 00:27:02,599
Excuse me. Excuse me.

314
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:04,664
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

315
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:06,730
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

316
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:09,009
Victor.

317
00:27:10,979 --> 00:27:14,039
- Dead end.
- Victor!

318
00:27:14,349 --> 00:27:15,782
Hello!

319
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:26,884
Could have used the stairs, silly.

320
00:27:29,364 --> 00:27:33,562
Isn't the view beautiful?
It takes my breath away.

321
00:27:34,769 --> 00:27:37,033
Well, it would if I had any.

322
00:27:38,707 --> 00:27:40,902
Isn't it romantic?

323
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:51,581
Look, I am terribly sorry
about what's happened to you...

324
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:55,052
...and I'd like to help,
but I really need to get home.

325
00:27:55,223 --> 00:27:58,386
- This is your home now.
- But I don't even know your name.

326
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:02,018
<i>Well, that's a great way</i>
<i>to start a marriage.</i>

327
00:28:02,197 --> 00:28:03,596
Shut up!

328
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,467
- It's Emily.
- Emily.

329
00:28:08,636 --> 00:28:12,470
Oh, I almost forgot.
I have something for you.

330
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,432
It's a wedding present.

331
00:28:28,556 --> 00:28:29,853
Thank you.

332
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,042
Scraps?

333
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:56,883
Scraps!

334
00:28:57,452 --> 00:28:59,010
My dog, Scraps!

335
00:29:01,523 --> 00:29:04,492
Oh, Scraps, what a good boy.

336
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:06,820
I knew you'd be happy to see him.

337
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:11,193
Who's my good boy?
Sit. Sit, Scraps, sit.

338
00:29:11,366 --> 00:29:14,631
Good boy, Scraps.
Roll over. Roll over.

339
00:29:14,803 --> 00:29:17,704
Good boy, Scraps.
Play dead.

340
00:29:19,474 --> 00:29:20,873
Sorry.

341
00:29:21,309 --> 00:29:22,936
Oh, what a cutie.

342
00:29:23,111 --> 00:29:25,170
You should have seen him with fur.

343
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,881
Mother never approved
of Scraps jumping up like this.

344
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:32,486
But then again,
she never approved of anything.

345
00:29:32,987 --> 00:29:35,478
Do you think
she would have approved of me?

346
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:38,190
You're lucky
you'll never have to meet her.

347
00:29:40,428 --> 00:29:41,725
Well, actually...

348
00:29:43,164 --> 00:29:46,998
...now that you mention it,
I think you should.

349
00:29:47,168 --> 00:29:50,160
In fact, since we're, you know...

350
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,902
...married,
you should definitely meet her.

351
00:29:54,309 --> 00:29:57,073
And my father too. We should go
and see them right now.

352
00:29:57,245 --> 00:30:00,009
What a fantastic idea!
Where are they buried?

353
00:30:01,916 --> 00:30:05,079
- What? What is it?
- They're not from around here.

354
00:30:05,253 --> 00:30:06,777
Where are they?

355
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,417
Oh, they're still alive.

356
00:30:09,591 --> 00:30:11,718
- I'm afraid so.
- Well, that is a problem.

357
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,258
What's that, Scraps?

358
00:30:14,596 --> 00:30:16,564
Oh, no, we couldn't possibly.

359
00:30:18,466 --> 00:30:22,232
- Oh, well, if you put it like that.
- What?

360
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,128
Elder Gutknecht.

361
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:34,570
Scraps.

362
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:37,081
Elder Gutknecht...

363
00:30:37,485 --> 00:30:38,975
...are you there?

364
00:30:42,023 --> 00:30:44,958
Hello? Is anyone home?

365
00:30:45,827 --> 00:30:47,294
Hello?

366
00:30:58,673 --> 00:31:00,402
There you are!

367
00:31:01,075 --> 00:31:03,475
Oh, my dear. There you are.

368
00:31:03,645 --> 00:31:06,079
I've brought my husband, Victor.

369
00:31:06,247 --> 00:31:09,045
What's that? Husband?

370
00:31:09,417 --> 00:31:11,647
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

371
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:16,890
We need to go up. Upstairs?
To visit the land of the living.

372
00:31:17,058 --> 00:31:19,288
Land of the living?

373
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,327
Oh, my dear.

374
00:31:23,495 --> 00:31:25,292
Please, Elder Gutknecht.

375
00:31:25,464 --> 00:31:29,298
Now, why go up there, when
people are dying to get down here?

376
00:31:29,468 --> 00:31:32,528
Sir, I beg you to help.
It means so much to me...

377
00:31:33,672 --> 00:31:37,768
- Us.
- I don't know, it's just not natural.

378
00:31:37,943 --> 00:31:39,843
Please, Elder Gutknecht.

379
00:31:40,012 --> 00:31:42,640
Surely there must be something
you can do.

380
00:31:44,617 --> 00:31:47,211
Let me see what I can do.

381
00:31:47,553 --> 00:31:50,454
Where did I put that book?

382
00:31:57,129 --> 00:31:59,359
I left it here somewhere.

383
00:32:02,768 --> 00:32:04,861
There's the one.

384
00:32:18,584 --> 00:32:20,176
I have it.

385
00:32:20,586 --> 00:32:25,250
A Ukrainian haunting spell.
Just the thing for these quick trips.

386
00:32:25,891 --> 00:32:29,657
- So glad you thought of this.
- Me too.

387
00:32:53,252 --> 00:32:54,651
Now, then...

388
00:32:55,854 --> 00:32:57,253
...where were we?

389
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:00,549
The Ukrainian haunting spell?

390
00:33:09,735 --> 00:33:12,636
Here we have it. Ready?

391
00:33:12,805 --> 00:33:16,741
Just remember, when you
want to come back, say "Hopscotch."

392
00:33:16,909 --> 00:33:19,639
- Hopscotch?
- That's it.

393
00:33:36,161 --> 00:33:38,391
I spent so long in the darkness...

394
00:33:38,564 --> 00:33:43,263
...I’d almost forgotten how beautiful
the moonlight is.

395
00:34:10,529 --> 00:34:12,827
Hey, I think you dropped something.

396
00:34:31,984 --> 00:34:33,576
Hold on, hold on.

397
00:34:35,587 --> 00:34:39,921
I think I should prepare Mother
and Father for the big news.

398
00:34:41,627 --> 00:34:43,561
I'll go ahead and you...

399
00:34:44,396 --> 00:34:45,863
...wait here.

400
00:34:46,465 --> 00:34:49,059
- Perfect.
- I won't be long.

401
00:34:49,935 --> 00:34:52,836
Stay right here. I'll be right back.

402
00:34:53,005 --> 00:34:54,563
Okay.

403
00:34:55,307 --> 00:34:57,002
No peeking.

404
00:35:16,261 --> 00:35:19,196
If ever I see that Van Dort boy...

405
00:35:19,364 --> 00:35:22,629
...I'll strangle him with my bare hands.

406
00:35:22,801 --> 00:35:26,965
Your hands are too fat,
and his neck is too thin.

407
00:35:27,139 --> 00:35:29,505
You'll have to use a rope.

408
00:35:39,384 --> 00:35:44,219
<i>This is the voice of your conscience.</i>
<i>Listen to what I say.</i>

409
00:35:44,389 --> 00:35:48,587
<i>I have a bad feeling about that boy.</i>
<i>You know he is no...</i>

410
00:35:50,696 --> 00:35:53,062
Go chew someone else's ear for a while.

411
00:35:53,232 --> 00:35:56,963
Victor has gone to see his parents,
just like he said.

412
00:35:57,603 --> 00:36:01,471
If I hadn't just been sitting in it,
I would say that you had lost your mind!

413
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:06,100
I'm sure he has a perfectly
good reason for taking so long.

414
00:36:06,278 --> 00:36:09,475
I am sure he does.
Why don't you go ask him?

415
00:36:09,648 --> 00:36:10,706
All right, I will.

416
00:36:10,883 --> 00:36:15,445
After all, he couldn't get far
with those cold feet.

417
00:36:53,926 --> 00:36:57,919
- Victoria.
- Victor? I'm so happy to see you.

418
00:36:58,096 --> 00:37:02,089
Come by the fire. Where have you been?
Are you all right?

419
00:37:02,634 --> 00:37:04,295
I... I...

420
00:37:04,503 --> 00:37:05,834
Oh, dear.

421
00:37:06,672 --> 00:37:10,267
You're as cold as death.
What's happened to you?

422
00:37:10,442 --> 00:37:12,307
Your coat.

423
00:37:13,111 --> 00:37:16,012
Victoria, I confess.

424
00:37:17,249 --> 00:37:20,377
This morning
I was terrified of marriage.

425
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:26,414
But then, on meeting you,
I felt I should be with you always...

426
00:37:26,591 --> 00:37:30,789
...and that our wedding
could not come soon enough.

427
00:37:33,765 --> 00:37:37,201
Victor, I feel the same.

428
00:37:42,107 --> 00:37:44,735
Victoria, I se... I se...

429
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:47,470
I seem to find myself married.

430
00:37:47,646 --> 00:37:50,376
And you should know it's unexpected.

431
00:37:54,252 --> 00:37:56,550
My darling,
I just wanted to meet...

432
00:37:59,324 --> 00:38:01,986
Darling? Who's this?

433
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,596
- Who is she?
- I'm his wife.

434
00:38:07,032 --> 00:38:09,557
- Victor?
- Victoria, wait. You don't understand.

435
00:38:10,035 --> 00:38:12,265
She's dead. Look.

436
00:38:15,941 --> 00:38:17,238
Hopscotch.

437
00:38:20,112 --> 00:38:22,910
No! No! Victoria!

438
00:38:27,786 --> 00:38:29,754
You lied to me!

439
00:38:29,921 --> 00:38:32,412
Just to get back to that other woman.

440
00:38:32,591 --> 00:38:35,526
Don't you understand?
You're the other woman.

441
00:38:35,694 --> 00:38:40,222
No! You're married to me.
She's the other woman.

442
00:38:43,869 --> 00:38:45,632
She's got a point.

443
00:38:46,304 --> 00:38:51,469
And I thought... I thought
this was all going so well.

444
00:39:00,318 --> 00:39:03,617
Look, I'm sorry, but...

445
00:39:03,789 --> 00:39:05,256
...this just can't work.

446
00:39:05,424 --> 00:39:07,358
Why not?

447
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,555
It's my eye, isn't it?

448
00:39:10,729 --> 00:39:12,390
No. Your eye is...

449
00:39:13,498 --> 00:39:14,795
...lovely.

450
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:20,034
Listen, under different circumstances,
well, who knows?

451
00:39:20,439 --> 00:39:24,808
But we're just too different.
I mean, you're dead.

452
00:39:24,976 --> 00:39:28,002
You should've thought about that
before you asked me to marry you.

453
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:31,707
Why can't you understand? It was
a mistake. I would never marry you.

454
00:40:02,114 --> 00:40:04,810
Roses for eternal love.

455
00:40:05,884 --> 00:40:08,284
Lilies for sweetness.

456
00:40:11,056 --> 00:40:12,614
Baby's breath.

457
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:20,022
Why so blue?

458
00:40:20,198 --> 00:40:23,258
Maybe he's right.
Maybe we are too different.

459
00:40:23,435 --> 00:40:26,029
<i>Maybe he should</i>
<i>have his head examined.</i>

460
00:40:27,572 --> 00:40:29,369
I could do it.

461
00:40:29,541 --> 00:40:33,033
Or perhaps he does belong with her.
Little Miss Living.

462
00:40:33,211 --> 00:40:36,578
With her rosy cheeks and beating heart.

463
00:40:37,082 --> 00:40:41,280
Oh, those girls are ten a penny.
You've got so much more.

464
00:40:41,453 --> 00:40:43,751
You've got... You've got...

465
00:40:43,922 --> 00:40:46,413
You've got a wonderful personality.

466
00:40:53,498 --> 00:40:57,935
<i>What does that wispy little brat have</i>
<i>That you don't have double?</i>

467
00:40:58,103 --> 00:41:01,732
<i>She can't hold a candle</i>
<i>To the beauty of your smile</i>

468
00:41:01,907 --> 00:41:03,169
How about a pulse?

469
00:41:03,341 --> 00:41:04,672
<i>Overrated by a mile</i>

470
00:41:04,843 --> 00:41:06,105
<i>- Overvalued</i>
<i>- Overblown</i>

471
00:41:06,344 --> 00:41:10,110
<i>If he only knew</i>
<i>The you that we know</i>

472
00:41:11,416 --> 00:41:14,385
<i>And that silly little creature</i>
<i>Isn't wearing his ring</i>

473
00:41:14,553 --> 00:41:17,954
<i>And she doesn't play piano</i>
<i>Or dance, or sing</i>

474
00:41:18,123 --> 00:41:19,886
<i>No, she doesn't compare</i>

475
00:41:20,058 --> 00:41:22,322
<i>- But she still breathes air</i>
<i>- Who cares?</i>

476
00:41:22,494 --> 00:41:23,756
<i>- Unimportant</i>
<i>- Overrated</i>

477
00:41:23,929 --> 00:41:26,124
<i>- Overblown</i>
<i>- if only he could see</i>

478
00:41:26,298 --> 00:41:27,925
<i>How special you can be</i>

479
00:41:28,099 --> 00:41:32,126
<i>If he only knew</i>
<i>The you that we know</i>

480
00:41:37,976 --> 00:41:42,913
<i>If I touch a burning candle</i>
<i>I can feel no pain</i>

481
00:41:43,648 --> 00:41:47,379
<i>If you cut me with a knife</i>
<i>It's still the same</i>

482
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:52,089
<i>And I know her heart is beating</i>

483
00:41:52,624 --> 00:41:55,024
<i>And I know that I am dead</i>

484
00:41:55,493 --> 00:41:57,859
<i>Yet the pain here that I feel</i>

485
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:01,090
<i>Try and tell me it's not real</i>

486
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:06,137
<i>And it seems that I still have</i>
<i>A tear to shed</i>

487
00:42:10,609 --> 00:42:13,874
<i>The sole redeeming feature</i>
<i>From that little creature</i>

488
00:42:14,045 --> 00:42:15,410
<i>Is that she's alive</i>

489
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,207
<i>- Overrated</i>
<i>- Overblown</i>

490
00:42:17,382 --> 00:42:20,408
<i>Everybody knows</i>
<i>That's just a temporary state</i>

491
00:42:20,585 --> 00:42:23,782
<i>Which is cured very quickly</i>
<i>When we meet our fate</i>

492
00:42:23,955 --> 00:42:25,479
<i>- Who cares?</i>
<i>- Unimportant</i>

493
00:42:25,657 --> 00:42:27,022
<i>- Overrated</i>
<i>- Overblown</i>

494
00:42:27,192 --> 00:42:30,457
<i>If only he could see</i>
<i>How special you can be</i>

495
00:42:30,629 --> 00:42:35,089
<i>If he only knew</i>
<i>The you that we know</i>

496
00:42:40,372 --> 00:42:45,708
<i>If I touch a burning candle</i>
<i>I can feel no pain</i>

497
00:42:46,111 --> 00:42:50,138
<i>In the ice or in the sun</i>
<i>It's all the same</i>

498
00:42:51,916 --> 00:42:54,578
<i>Yet I feel my heart is aching</i>

499
00:42:55,086 --> 00:42:57,884
<i>Though it doesn't beat, it's breaking</i>

500
00:42:58,056 --> 00:43:00,581
<i>And the pain here that I feel</i>

501
00:43:01,026 --> 00:43:03,290
<i>Try and tell me it's not real</i>

502
00:43:04,095 --> 00:43:06,757
<i>I know that I am dead</i>

503
00:43:07,699 --> 00:43:12,159
<i>Yet it seems that I still have</i>
<i>Some tears to shed</i>

504
00:43:21,279 --> 00:43:23,213
It's true, Mother!

505
00:43:23,381 --> 00:43:26,145
Victor is married to a dead woman.

506
00:43:26,318 --> 00:43:31,085
I saw her. A corpse!
Standing right here with Victor.

507
00:43:31,256 --> 00:43:32,814
Victor was in your room?

508
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:34,356
I have to help him.

509
00:43:34,526 --> 00:43:36,050
The scandal!

510
00:43:36,227 --> 00:43:40,061
Come sit in your chair, dearie.
You're shaking like a leaf.

511
00:43:40,231 --> 00:43:42,256
Let Hilde fetch you a blanket.

512
00:43:42,434 --> 00:43:45,835
Fetch her a straitjacket!
She's completely mad!

513
00:43:46,004 --> 00:43:47,869
Come, Hildegarde.

514
00:44:21,139 --> 00:44:24,074
Finis, come to bed at once.

515
00:44:44,829 --> 00:44:47,798
What in heaven's name?

516
00:44:50,402 --> 00:44:53,394
Who could that be at this hour?

517
00:44:54,939 --> 00:44:56,201
Miss Everglot.

518
00:44:56,641 --> 00:45:00,907
What are you doing here? You should be
at home, prostrate with grief.

519
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:03,775
Pastor Galswells,
I have to ask you something.

520
00:45:03,948 --> 00:45:07,349
- This is most irregular.
- Please, I beg of you.

521
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:12,013
You are the only one in the village who
knows of what awaits beyond the grave.

522
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:14,920
A grim topic for a bride-to-be.

523
00:45:15,226 --> 00:45:20,061
It is a bride I fear,
which is why I must know:

524
00:45:20,598 --> 00:45:22,793
Can the living marry the dead?

525
00:45:23,067 --> 00:45:25,831
What on earth are you speaking about?

526
00:45:26,004 --> 00:45:28,973
Please, it's Victor.
He's married to a corpse.

527
00:45:29,407 --> 00:45:31,637
He has a corpse bride!

528
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:35,507
There must be some way
to undo what's been done.

529
00:45:37,916 --> 00:45:40,885
I believe I know the thing to do.

530
00:45:41,586 --> 00:45:42,917
Come with me.

531
00:45:45,723 --> 00:45:48,214
Victoria? Where are your corsets?

532
00:45:48,393 --> 00:45:52,090
She's speaking in tongues.
Of unholy alliances.

533
00:45:52,263 --> 00:45:54,527
Her mind has come undone, I fear.

534
00:45:54,699 --> 00:45:56,826
It's not true! Let me go! Let me go!

535
00:45:57,001 --> 00:46:01,700
Thank you, Pastor Galswells.
Thank you so very much.

536
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:03,671
Take her to her room!

537
00:46:03,842 --> 00:46:06,276
No, I'm telling the truth.

538
00:46:06,444 --> 00:46:08,309
Victor needs my help.

539
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,710
Hildegarde, you believe me, don't you?

540
00:46:10,882 --> 00:46:13,817
- Mother, Father, please.
- Seal the doors...

541
00:46:13,985 --> 00:46:18,445
...and bar the windows. See to it that
she doesn't escape again.

542
00:46:18,723 --> 00:46:23,023
He needs our help! Oh, let me go!
Let me go!

543
00:46:23,194 --> 00:46:27,221
Will the mortification never cease?

544
00:46:27,398 --> 00:46:30,595
It will be years before we can show
ourselves in public again.

545
00:46:30,768 --> 00:46:32,030
What shall we do?

546
00:46:32,203 --> 00:46:35,832
We shall continue as planned,
with or without Vincent.

547
00:46:36,007 --> 00:46:38,271
- Victor.
- Whatever.

548
00:46:38,443 --> 00:46:43,176
For that boy to toss aside
a young woman like Victoria...

549
00:46:43,348 --> 00:46:45,373
...it's positively criminal.

550
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:49,748
Why, if I had a woman
like your daughter on my arm...

551
00:46:49,921 --> 00:46:54,517
...I would lavish her with riches
befitting royalty.

552
00:46:54,692 --> 00:46:58,355
Your lady wife
is a most fortunate woman.

553
00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:01,397
Alas, I am not married.

554
00:47:01,566 --> 00:47:03,431
I was betrothed some years ago...

555
00:47:03,601 --> 00:47:07,537
...but tragedy snatched
my young bride away.

556
00:47:07,772 --> 00:47:11,765
When one lives alone,
wealth counts for naught.

557
00:47:19,884 --> 00:47:23,786
Marvelous news, Victoria,
there'll be a wedding after all.

558
00:47:23,955 --> 00:47:25,252
You found him?

559
00:47:25,423 --> 00:47:28,881
Make haste, my dear,
our relatives will arrive at any moment.

560
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:32,860
We must have you looking presentable
for Lord Barkis.

561
00:47:34,532 --> 00:47:35,794
Lord Barkis?

562
00:47:35,967 --> 00:47:37,491
He will make a fine husband.

563
00:47:37,669 --> 00:47:41,002
Aye. A fortuitous turn of events indeed.

564
00:47:41,172 --> 00:47:43,436
A far better prospect this time.

565
00:47:43,608 --> 00:47:47,305
But I do not love him.
You cannot make me do this.

566
00:47:47,478 --> 00:47:50,345
- We must.
- Please, I beg of you.

567
00:47:50,515 --> 00:47:51,948
There must be another way.

568
00:47:52,116 --> 00:47:54,050
Without your marriage to Lord Barkis...

569
00:47:54,218 --> 00:47:56,709
...we shall be forced,
penniless, into the street.

570
00:47:56,888 --> 00:47:58,321
We are destitute.

571
00:47:58,756 --> 00:48:00,451
But Victor...

572
00:48:00,625 --> 00:48:03,150
Victor Van Dort has gone, child.

573
00:48:03,328 --> 00:48:06,354
You shall marry Lord Barkis tomorrow.

574
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:11,295
- According to plan.
- According to plan.

575
00:48:40,031 --> 00:48:43,694
Oh, my dear.
Oh, don't look at me that way.

576
00:48:43,868 --> 00:48:48,202
You have only to suffer this union
until death do us part.

577
00:48:48,539 --> 00:48:52,202
And that will come sooner
than you think.

578
00:48:55,513 --> 00:48:57,481
Oh, it's almost dawn!
Where could he be?

579
00:48:57,649 --> 00:49:00,709
Victor Van Dort elopes with corpse!

580
00:49:00,885 --> 00:49:04,582
Heartbroken bride to wed
wealthy newcomer!

581
00:49:04,756 --> 00:49:07,418
Wealthy newcomer? It cannot be.

582
00:49:07,592 --> 00:49:09,355
Did he say corpse?

583
00:49:09,527 --> 00:49:13,361
Oh, don't be ridiculous. What corpse
would marry our Victor?

584
00:49:13,531 --> 00:49:19,527
Oh, Mayhew!
Silence that blasted coughing.

585
00:49:36,087 --> 00:49:38,681
Mayhew, are you trying to kill us?

586
00:49:38,856 --> 00:49:41,120
I think he's trying to kill us.

587
00:50:20,298 --> 00:50:21,629
I...

588
00:50:22,867 --> 00:50:24,698
...think you dropped this.

589
00:50:33,811 --> 00:50:35,142
I'm sorry.

590
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:39,277
I'm sorry I lied to you
about wanting to see my parents.

591
00:50:39,584 --> 00:50:43,782
It's just this whole day
hasn't gone quite, well...

592
00:50:46,424 --> 00:50:48,085
...according to plan.

593
00:51:53,658 --> 00:51:55,250
Pardon my enthusiasm.

594
00:51:55,593 --> 00:51:57,652
I like your enthusiasm.

595
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:05,758
- New arrival! New arrival!
- Lights up!

596
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,639
Hurry up, boys!

597
00:52:13,578 --> 00:52:15,205
Drinks for everyone.

598
00:52:15,379 --> 00:52:16,471
Another pint, sir?

599
00:52:16,647 --> 00:52:18,672
- No, no. Just a half.
- No, no. Just a half.

600
00:52:23,921 --> 00:52:26,583
It is impossible
to get good help anymore.

601
00:52:26,757 --> 00:52:29,487
Welcoming committee, coming through!
Coming through!

602
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:34,461
- My name's Plum. Miss Plum.
- Mayhew?

603
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:38,401
Mayhew! How nice to see...

604
00:52:40,638 --> 00:52:41,832
I'm so sorry.

605
00:52:42,006 --> 00:52:46,375
Oh, yeah. Actually, though, I feel great.

606
00:52:48,446 --> 00:52:52,314
Hurry up, boys. Can you not see
the gentleman is parched?

607
00:52:53,251 --> 00:52:56,152
Mayhew, I have to get back.

608
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,880
They all must be worried sick.
How is everyone?

609
00:52:59,056 --> 00:53:03,015
Well, they're still wondering
where you slipped off to.

610
00:53:03,194 --> 00:53:05,389
Oh, and Miss Victoria...

611
00:53:05,563 --> 00:53:07,121
Yes? Yes, how is she?

612
00:53:07,298 --> 00:53:10,233
Well, she's getting married
this evening.

613
00:53:10,401 --> 00:53:12,392
What? Married to who?

614
00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:16,233
Some newcomer,
Lord Somebody-or-Other.

615
00:53:16,407 --> 00:53:17,738
But that's impossible!

616
00:53:17,909 --> 00:53:20,070
Yeah, with you gone and all...

617
00:53:20,244 --> 00:53:23,611
I guess they didn't wanna
waste the cake.

618
00:53:25,483 --> 00:53:26,677
But how could she?

619
00:53:26,851 --> 00:53:29,752
Women, you can't live with them.

620
00:53:29,921 --> 00:53:32,185
You can't live with...

621
00:53:34,158 --> 00:53:39,255
Time to pick up the pieces and...
You know, and move on, I suppose.

622
00:53:40,364 --> 00:53:42,491
Speaking of picking up the pieces?

623
00:53:45,937 --> 00:53:49,202
Victor? Where are you going?

624
00:53:52,376 --> 00:53:57,211
Miss Victoria, we must leave
for the church now.

625
00:53:57,615 --> 00:54:01,073
Yesterday I thought my wedding
would be happy.

626
00:54:01,285 --> 00:54:05,278
Now I feel like I'm caught
in the tide, pulled out to sea.

627
00:54:05,456 --> 00:54:09,153
The sea leads to many places, dearie.

628
00:54:10,094 --> 00:54:13,586
Maybe you'll land somewhere better.

629
00:54:19,403 --> 00:54:23,965
With this candle, I will light
your way in darkness.

630
00:54:30,014 --> 00:54:35,680
With this ring,
I ask you to be mine.

631
00:54:39,490 --> 00:54:44,086
I now pronounce you man and wife.

632
00:54:44,695 --> 00:54:46,663
Oh, oh, dear.

633
00:55:02,613 --> 00:55:04,547
I'm too late.

634
00:55:08,786 --> 00:55:11,277
Oh, Mrs. Plum, what am I to do?

635
00:55:11,455 --> 00:55:15,687
He just walked off without saying
a word. Are all men like this?

636
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:18,727
Well, I'm afraid none of them
are very bright.

637
00:55:18,896 --> 00:55:20,796
They get something stuck
in their heads...

638
00:55:20,965 --> 00:55:23,525
...and you can't do a thing with them.

639
00:55:24,535 --> 00:55:26,969
My dear, we have to talk.

640
00:55:27,138 --> 00:55:31,472
- Let me tell her, please. Let me tell her.
- What?

641
00:55:31,642 --> 00:55:34,702
There is a complication
with your marriage.

642
00:55:35,212 --> 00:55:36,702
I don't understand.

643
00:55:36,881 --> 00:55:41,318
The vows are binding
only until death do you part.

644
00:55:41,719 --> 00:55:42,981
What are you saying?

645
00:55:43,721 --> 00:55:46,451
Death has already parted you.

646
00:55:47,691 --> 00:55:49,522
If he finds out, he'll leave.

647
00:55:49,693 --> 00:55:51,718
There must be something you can do.

648
00:55:51,896 --> 00:55:54,660
Well, there is one way.

649
00:55:54,832 --> 00:55:56,732
Oh, please, please, let me tell her.

650
00:55:56,901 --> 00:55:59,927
It requires the greatest sacrifice.

651
00:56:00,538 --> 00:56:03,905
- Go on, get to the good part.
- What is it?

652
00:56:04,075 --> 00:56:06,771
- We have to kill him!
- What?

653
00:56:06,944 --> 00:56:11,677
Victor would have to give up
the life he had forever.

654
00:56:12,083 --> 00:56:15,917
He would need to repeat his vows
in the land of the living...

655
00:56:16,087 --> 00:56:19,352
...and drink from the wine of ages.

656
00:56:20,191 --> 00:56:21,453
Poison!

657
00:56:21,725 --> 00:56:24,853
This would stop his heart forever.

658
00:56:25,029 --> 00:56:28,294
Only then would he be free
to give it to you.

659
00:56:31,368 --> 00:56:33,928
I could never ask him.

660
00:56:36,407 --> 00:56:38,204
You don't have to.

661
00:56:40,744 --> 00:56:42,006
I'll do it.

662
00:56:42,446 --> 00:56:45,381
My boy, if you choose this path...

663
00:56:45,549 --> 00:56:48,416
...you may never return
to the world above.

664
00:56:48,586 --> 00:56:50,144
Do you understand?

665
00:56:53,591 --> 00:56:55,559
I do.

666
00:56:55,926 --> 00:56:58,793
Gather round. Gather round, everybody.

667
00:57:02,533 --> 00:57:05,093
We've decided to do this thing properly.

668
00:57:05,269 --> 00:57:07,669
So grab what you can and follow us.

669
00:57:07,838 --> 00:57:10,398
We're moving this wedding party upstairs.

670
00:57:10,574 --> 00:57:14,738
Upstairs? I didn't know
we had an upstairs.

671
00:57:14,912 --> 00:57:17,472
- Sounds creepy.
- Let's go!

672
00:57:17,915 --> 00:57:20,975
<i>A wedding, a wedding</i>
<i>We're going to have a wedding</i>

673
00:57:23,654 --> 00:57:25,815
Hold on, Victor.

674
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:29,187
You can't get married looking like that.

675
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:32,659
<i>The spiders think you're very cute</i>
<i>But goodness knows you need a suit</i>

676
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:36,698
<i>But have no fears, we're quite adept</i>
<i>We'll have you looking lovely, lovely, lovely</i>

677
00:57:36,867 --> 00:57:39,233
<i>Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely yet</i>

678
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:43,233
<i>A little stitch, a little tuck</i>
<i>Some tender loving care</i>

679
00:57:43,407 --> 00:57:46,535
<i>A little thread will fix you up</i>
<i>And we've got plenty as you see</i>

680
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:50,077
<i>And personally guarantee</i>
<i>Our quality repairs</i>

681
00:57:50,247 --> 00:57:53,683
<i>A little here, I'll fix the mess</i>
<i>We're going to do our very best</i>

682
00:57:53,851 --> 00:57:56,445
<i>When everybody sees you</i>
<i>They will all be quite impressed</i>

683
00:57:56,620 --> 00:58:00,522
<i>They will all be quite impressed</i>

684
00:58:00,691 --> 00:58:02,386
<i>A wedding, we're going to have</i>

685
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:05,620
<i>A wedding cake is no mistake</i>
<i>It must be quite sublime</i>

686
00:58:05,796 --> 00:58:07,559
<i>- We're missing something</i>
<i>- Try some dust</i>

687
00:58:07,731 --> 00:58:09,062
<i>I wish I had more time</i>

688
00:58:09,233 --> 00:58:12,134
<i>Perhaps there's something I can do</i>
<i>These bones might help a bit</i>

689
00:58:12,303 --> 00:58:14,134
- Oh, my nose.
- Sorry.

690
00:58:14,305 --> 00:58:15,567
<i>Wait a minute, that's it</i>

691
00:58:15,739 --> 00:58:17,138
<i>- A little of that</i>
<i>- A little of this</i>

692
00:58:17,308 --> 00:58:19,003
<i>The perfect cake is hard to miss</i>

693
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:21,474
<i>A wedding, a wedding</i>
<i>We're going to have</i>

694
00:58:21,645 --> 00:58:22,942
<i>A wedding</i>

695
00:58:23,113 --> 00:58:24,740
<i>Huzzah, huzzah</i>

696
00:58:24,915 --> 00:58:27,440
<i>We're going to have a wedding</i>
<i>A wedding</i>

697
00:58:28,085 --> 00:58:33,887
<i>Let's all give out a cheer</i>
<i>'Cause the bride is getting married today</i>

698
00:58:35,159 --> 00:58:38,094
<i>One thing you can surely say</i>
<i>Is we will stand beside</i>

699
00:58:38,262 --> 00:58:41,163
<i>Until the end we will defend</i>
<i>Our one and only bride</i>

700
00:58:41,332 --> 00:58:44,529
<i>Our bride-to-be, our bride-to-be</i>
<i>Our lovely Corpse Bride</i>

701
00:58:44,702 --> 00:58:46,499
<i>Huzzah! Hooray! Huzzah! Hooray!</i>

702
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:50,902
<i>Our bride is getting married today</i>

703
00:58:51,075 --> 00:58:53,100
- Oh, there she is.
- Here she comes.

704
00:58:58,315 --> 00:59:01,978
<i>Oh, oh, the bride is here</i>

705
00:59:02,152 --> 00:59:05,952
<i>She's waited for this day</i>
<i>For many a year</i>

706
00:59:06,123 --> 00:59:10,287
<i>For this day, for this day</i>
<i>Our hopes and our pride</i>

707
00:59:10,461 --> 00:59:16,661
<i>The bride is here</i>
<i>Here comes the bride</i>

708
00:59:16,867 --> 00:59:20,826
<i>Here comes the bride</i>
<i>Here comes the bride</i>

709
00:59:21,071 --> 00:59:25,007
<i>For this day, for this day</i>
<i>Will last forever</i>

710
00:59:25,175 --> 00:59:28,975
<i>And all of her friends</i>
<i>Will work together</i>

711
00:59:29,146 --> 00:59:32,843
<i>To make it the perfect day</i>
<i>She's always dreamed</i>

712
00:59:33,017 --> 00:59:40,253
<i>Our hopes and our pride</i>
<i>Our bride, our lovely bride</i>

713
00:59:40,891 --> 00:59:43,655
<i>We're going to have a party</i>
<i>Like nobody's ever seen</i>

714
00:59:43,827 --> 00:59:47,524
<i>The living in the land above</i>
<i>Will not know where they've been</i>

715
00:59:47,698 --> 00:59:54,331
<i>The land above</i>
<i>The party of the bride</i>

716
00:59:55,172 --> 01:00:00,974
<i>Here comes the bride</i>
<i>On this glorious day of days</i>

717
01:00:01,145 --> 01:00:05,878
<i>Up to the land of the living</i>

718
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:13,855
<i>To celebrate</i>

719
01:00:16,293 --> 01:00:18,784
Oh, dear.

720
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:33,641
Quiet down now, everyone.

721
01:00:38,148 --> 01:00:39,615
Thank you.

722
01:00:40,651 --> 01:00:45,145
Elegant, cultured, radiant.

723
01:00:45,789 --> 01:00:48,553
Victoria has found a husband...

724
01:00:48,726 --> 01:00:52,890
...with all these qualities and more.

725
01:00:53,063 --> 01:00:55,657
Serendipity brought us together...

726
01:00:55,833 --> 01:01:01,135
...and no force on earth
could tear us apart.

727
01:01:21,658 --> 01:01:23,990
There's an eye in me soup.

728
01:01:33,504 --> 01:01:34,493
Oh, sorry.

729
01:01:41,578 --> 01:01:42,772
Fetch me musket!

730
01:01:42,946 --> 01:01:45,073
Fetch your own musket. I'm off!

731
01:01:45,249 --> 01:01:47,479
Coming through. Coming through.

732
01:01:50,754 --> 01:01:55,487
Excuse me, you don't know me,
but I used to live in your dead mother.

733
01:01:56,794 --> 01:01:58,421
Hey, hold on there.

734
01:01:58,929 --> 01:02:02,456
I love a woman with meat on her bones.

735
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:06,260
Finis, who invited these people?

736
01:02:07,237 --> 01:02:09,330
They must be from your side
of the family.

737
01:02:09,506 --> 01:02:10,768
Certainly not.

738
01:02:10,941 --> 01:02:14,900
Why, if my Grandfather Everglot could
see this, he'd be turning in his grave.

739
01:02:15,078 --> 01:02:17,012
Finis.

740
01:02:18,515 --> 01:02:20,710
Where do you keep the spirits?

741
01:02:29,593 --> 01:02:33,723
In other news, the dead walk the earth!

742
01:02:38,469 --> 01:02:42,166
Get back! Don't try
and sneak up on me!

743
01:02:42,339 --> 01:02:43,806
Get back!

744
01:02:45,175 --> 01:02:47,006
I'll give you such a wallop.

745
01:02:58,555 --> 01:02:59,817
No.

746
01:02:59,990 --> 01:03:01,355
Yeah.

747
01:03:15,839 --> 01:03:17,636
Grandpa?

748
01:03:21,245 --> 01:03:22,769
- Bounder!
- Sweetie pie.

749
01:03:22,946 --> 01:03:24,379
- Monster.
- Buttercup.

750
01:03:24,548 --> 01:03:26,345
- Cad!
- Gertrude!

751
01:03:26,817 --> 01:03:28,341
Alfred?

752
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:32,921
You've been dead for 15 years.

753
01:03:33,090 --> 01:03:36,958
Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.

754
01:03:37,127 --> 01:03:38,890
Ethel!

755
01:03:49,239 --> 01:03:51,036
Wait. That's it.

756
01:03:51,208 --> 01:03:54,609
We're going to take whatever money
we can and get out of here.

757
01:03:54,778 --> 01:03:57,212
Money? What money?

758
01:03:57,381 --> 01:03:59,747
Your dowry. It's my right!

759
01:03:59,917 --> 01:04:01,908
But my parents don't have any money.

760
01:04:02,085 --> 01:04:06,784
It's my marriage to you that will
save them from the poorhouse.

761
01:04:06,957 --> 01:04:09,050
Th... The poorhouse?

762
01:04:09,526 --> 01:04:13,360
You're lying. It isn't true.
Tell me that you're lying!

763
01:04:13,530 --> 01:04:17,330
Did things not go according
to your plan, Lord Barkis?

764
01:04:17,501 --> 01:04:22,302
Well, perhaps in disappointment
we are perfectly matched.

765
01:04:41,124 --> 01:04:43,922
Be gone, ye demons from hell!

766
01:04:44,094 --> 01:04:48,155
Back to the void
from whence you came!

767
01:04:48,332 --> 01:04:50,129
You shall not enter here.

768
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:52,860
Back, back!

769
01:04:53,036 --> 01:04:55,266
Keep it down, we're in a church.

770
01:04:55,439 --> 01:04:57,339
Evening.

771
01:05:33,844 --> 01:05:36,142
Dearly beloved and departed...

772
01:05:36,313 --> 01:05:42,013
...we are gathered here today to join
this man and this corpse in marriage.

773
01:05:45,355 --> 01:05:47,323
Victor?

774
01:05:49,292 --> 01:05:50,759
Living first.

775
01:05:52,829 --> 01:05:54,387
With this hand...

776
01:05:55,165 --> 01:05:57,656
...I will lift your sorrows.

777
01:05:59,269 --> 01:06:01,533
Your cup will never empty...

778
01:06:02,072 --> 01:06:04,063
...for I will be your wine.

779
01:06:04,975 --> 01:06:06,237
Now you.

780
01:06:11,415 --> 01:06:13,474
With this hand...

781
01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:15,948
...I will lift your sorrows.

782
01:06:17,454 --> 01:06:20,617
Your cup will never empty.

783
01:06:22,392 --> 01:06:24,417
For I will be...

784
01:06:30,033 --> 01:06:31,728
I will be...

785
01:06:33,637 --> 01:06:35,264
Go on, my dear.

786
01:06:35,872 --> 01:06:37,635
Your cup...

787
01:06:38,341 --> 01:06:40,400
...will never empty...

788
01:06:42,612 --> 01:06:44,546
...for I will be...

789
01:06:46,683 --> 01:06:48,878
I will be your wine.

790
01:06:53,523 --> 01:06:55,115
She's having second thoughts.

791
01:06:58,228 --> 01:06:59,320
I can't.

792
01:06:59,996 --> 01:07:01,691
What's wrong?

793
01:07:02,999 --> 01:07:04,796
This is wrong.

794
01:07:06,036 --> 01:07:08,129
I was a bride.

795
01:07:08,605 --> 01:07:11,199
My dreams were taken from me.

796
01:07:12,008 --> 01:07:13,635
Well, now...

797
01:07:14,144 --> 01:07:17,204
Now I've stolen them
from someone else.

798
01:07:17,948 --> 01:07:20,439
I love you, Victor.

799
01:07:21,752 --> 01:07:24,118
But you're not mine.

800
01:07:29,493 --> 01:07:30,755
Victoria!

801
01:07:45,575 --> 01:07:48,703
Oh, how touching.

802
01:07:48,879 --> 01:07:51,677
I always cry at weddings.

803
01:07:52,983 --> 01:07:57,317
Our young lovers together at last.

804
01:07:57,487 --> 01:08:01,446
Surely now they can live
happily ever after.

805
01:08:02,492 --> 01:08:04,119
But you forget...

806
01:08:04,327 --> 01:08:06,420
...she's still my wife!

807
01:08:06,596 --> 01:08:09,224
I'll not leave here empty-handed!

808
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:11,760
You?

809
01:08:14,738 --> 01:08:16,171
Emily?

810
01:08:16,339 --> 01:08:17,533
You!

811
01:08:17,707 --> 01:08:20,699
But... But... I left you.

812
01:08:21,812 --> 01:08:23,609
For dead.

813
01:08:24,414 --> 01:08:26,245
This woman is obviously delusional!

814
01:08:33,924 --> 01:08:37,223
Sorry to cut things short,
but we must be on our way.

815
01:08:37,394 --> 01:08:39,760
Take your hands off her.

816
01:08:40,764 --> 01:08:43,562
Do I have to kill you too?

817
01:08:46,937 --> 01:08:49,963
Victor, catch!

818
01:08:50,607 --> 01:08:52,097
Sorry.

819
01:09:06,723 --> 01:09:09,089
I say, you're not playing fair, sir.

820
01:09:50,934 --> 01:09:52,834
Touché, my dear.

821
01:09:53,436 --> 01:09:54,767
Get out.

822
01:09:55,505 --> 01:09:58,303
Oh, I'm leaving.

823
01:10:02,812 --> 01:10:05,804
But first a toast. To Emily.

824
01:10:05,982 --> 01:10:10,419
Always the bridesmaid, never the bride.

825
01:10:10,887 --> 01:10:12,548
Tell me, my dear...

826
01:10:12,722 --> 01:10:16,783
...can a heart still break
once it's stopped beating?

827
01:10:19,796 --> 01:10:21,263
Let me at him! Let me at him!

828
01:10:21,431 --> 01:10:22,989
- No, don't hold me back.
- Wait.

829
01:10:24,267 --> 01:10:26,895
We must abide by their rules.

830
01:10:27,070 --> 01:10:30,267
We are amongst the living.

831
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:32,305
Well said.

832
01:10:48,224 --> 01:10:50,192
Not anymore.

833
01:10:53,730 --> 01:10:56,631
Yep, you're right. He's all yours.

834
01:11:07,978 --> 01:11:10,037
New arrival.

835
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:20,679
Oh, Victor,
I never thought I'd see you again.

836
01:11:28,031 --> 01:11:29,521
Wait.

837
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:32,530
I made a promise.

838
01:11:35,238 --> 01:11:37,832
You kept your promise.

839
01:11:38,675 --> 01:11:40,643
You set me free.

840
01:11:51,488 --> 01:11:54,514
Now I can do the same for you.
