1
00:02:55,817 --> 00:02:58,342
Forward march!

2
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,836
I'm requesting-

3
00:04:32,914 --> 00:04:37,044
Captain, I'd like to request
that it be me who's the attorney-

4
00:04:37,118 --> 00:04:39,882
That it be myself who’s assigned.

5
00:04:39,954 --> 00:04:42,787
No, I'd like to request
that it be I who am assigned-

6
00:04:44,358 --> 00:04:46,519
"That it be I who am assigned"?

7
00:04:46,594 --> 00:04:49,927
That's good.
That's confidence-inspiring.

8
00:04:49,997 --> 00:04:51,931
Good grammar there.

9
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:54,194
Captain, I'd like to request...

10
00:04:54,268 --> 00:04:57,760
that I be the attorney assigned.

11
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,441
I'm Lieutenant Commander Galloway
here to see Captain West.

12
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,444
Go right in, Commander.
They're expecting you.

13
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:05,945
Thank you.

14
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,451
-Jo, come on in.
- Thank you, sir.

15
00:05:12,587 --> 00:05:15,488
Captain West,
this is Lieutenant Commander Galloway.

16
00:05:15,556 --> 00:05:17,922
-Jo, you know Commander Lawrence.
- Yes, sir.

17
00:05:17,992 --> 00:05:20,153
Captain, I appreciate
you seeing me on such short notice.

18
00:05:20,228 --> 00:05:22,788
- Would you like to sit down?
- I'm fine, sir.

19
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,332
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

20
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:27,594
I understand we had some trouble
over the weekend down in Cuba?

21
00:05:27,668 --> 00:05:30,967
Yes, sir.
This past Friday, two Marines-

22
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:34,997
a Lance Corporal Harold Dawson
and a Private Louden Downey-

23
00:05:35,076 --> 00:05:39,274
entered the barracks room of a P.F.C.
William Santiago and assaulted him.

24
00:05:39,347 --> 00:05:42,839
Santiago died at the base hospital
approximately an hour later.

25
00:05:42,917 --> 00:05:46,444
The N.I.S. Agent who took
Dawson and Downey's statements...

26
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,818
maintains they were trying
to prevent Santiago...

27
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,723
from naming Dawson
in a fence line shooting incident.

28
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:55,558
They're scheduled to have a hearing
down in Cuba this afternoon at 1600.

29
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,564
- What's the problem?
- Dawson and Downey...

30
00:05:57,632 --> 00:06:01,966
are both recruiting poster Marines,
and Santiago was known to be a screw-up.

31
00:06:02,036 --> 00:06:04,800
I was thinking it sounded an awful lot
like a Code Red.

32
00:06:05,606 --> 00:06:07,164
Christ.

33
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:10,904
Sir, I'd like to have them moved
up to Washington and assigned counsel-

34
00:06:10,978 --> 00:06:13,276
someone who can really
look into this-

35
00:06:13,347 --> 00:06:15,713
someone who possesses
not only the legal skill...

36
00:06:15,783 --> 00:06:18,718
but a familiarity
with the inner workings of the military.

37
00:06:18,786 --> 00:06:21,277
In short, Captain,
I'd like to suggest that...

38
00:06:21,355 --> 00:06:23,323
I be the one who that-

39
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:27,054
that it be me who is assigned
to represent them...

40
00:06:27,128 --> 00:06:28,561
myself.

41
00:06:30,631 --> 00:06:33,156
Commander Galloway, why don’t you
get yourself a cup of coffee?

42
00:06:33,234 --> 00:06:35,225
Thank you, sir. I'm fine.

43
00:06:35,303 --> 00:06:38,500
I'd like you to leave the room so
we can talk about you behind your back.

44
00:06:38,572 --> 00:06:40,506
Certainly, sir.

45
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:50,341
I thought this Code Red shit
wasn't going on anymore.

46
00:06:50,418 --> 00:06:53,512
With the Marines at Gitmo, who knows
what the hell goes on down there?

47
00:06:53,587 --> 00:06:55,555
We better find out
before the rest of the world does.

48
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,648
Damn thing could get messy.

49
00:06:57,725 --> 00:07:00,250
All right,
what about this Commander Galloway?

50
00:07:00,328 --> 00:07:03,456
She's been working a desk
in Internal Affairs...

51
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:05,465
for a little over a year now.

52
00:07:05,533 --> 00:07:08,525
- Before that?
- Disposed of three cases in two years.

53
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:11,435
Three cases in two years?
Who's she handling, the Rosenbergs?

54
00:07:11,505 --> 00:07:14,030
- She's not cut out for litigation.
- She's a hell of an investigator.

55
00:07:14,108 --> 00:07:17,600
In Internal Affairs she can crawl up
a lawyer's ass with the best of them.

56
00:07:17,678 --> 00:07:21,512
- But when it comes to trial work-
- I know. All passion, no street smarts.

57
00:07:21,582 --> 00:07:23,516
Bring her back in.

58
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,964
Commander, we're gonna have the
defendants moved up here in the morning.

59
00:07:37,031 --> 00:07:40,194
- Thank you, sir.
- Division will assign them counsel.

60
00:07:41,135 --> 00:07:45,629
-But not me.
-From what I get from your colleagues...

61
00:07:45,706 --> 00:07:48,038
you're much too valuable in your
present assignment to be wasted...

62
00:07:48,109 --> 00:07:50,202
in what I'm sure will boil down
to a five-minute plea bargain...

63
00:07:50,277 --> 00:07:52,211
and a week's worth of paperwork.

64
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:54,406
Sir, I think there might be
more involved than that.

65
00:07:54,482 --> 00:07:55,915
Don't worry about it.

66
00:07:55,983 --> 00:07:58,884
I promise you Division will assign
the right man for the job.

67
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,288
All right. Let's go.
Let's get two.

68
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:05,052
- Sorry.
- Nothing to be sorry about, Sherby.

69
00:08:05,126 --> 00:08:07,321
You just look the ball
into your glove.

70
00:08:07,395 --> 00:08:08,828
Shooting two.

71
00:08:10,631 --> 00:08:12,599
- Sorry.
- You gotta trust me, Sherby.

72
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:16,397
Keep your eyes open, your chances of
catching it increase by a factor often.

73
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,335
- Kaffee.
- Let's try it again.

74
00:08:19,507 --> 00:08:21,498
Dave, you seem distraught.

75
00:08:21,575 --> 00:08:24,339
We were supposed to meet 15 minutes ago
about the McDermott case.

76
00:08:24,412 --> 00:08:27,108
You're stalling on this thing.
Now we either do it now...

77
00:08:27,181 --> 00:08:30,776
or, no kidding, Kaffee, I'm gonna
hang your boy from a fucking yardarm!

78
00:08:30,851 --> 00:08:34,810
Yardarm? Sherby, does the Navy
still hang people from yardarms?

79
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,356
I don't think so.

80
00:08:36,424 --> 00:08:39,757
Dave, Sherby doesn't think the Navy
hangs people from yardarms anymore.

81
00:08:39,827 --> 00:08:43,194
I'm gonna charge him with possession
and being under the influence on duty.

82
00:08:43,264 --> 00:08:47,428
You plead guilty, I'll recommend 30 days
in the brig with loss of rank and pay.

83
00:08:47,501 --> 00:08:50,470
It was oregano, Dave.
It was $10 worth of oregano.

84
00:08:50,538 --> 00:08:52,472
Yeah, well, your client thought
it was marijuana.

85
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,270
My client's a moron.
That's not against the law.

86
00:08:55,342 --> 00:08:58,709
Kaffee, I got people to answer to
just like you do. I'm gonna charge him.

87
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:01,009
With what,
possession of a condiment?

88
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,642
- Kaffee.
- I tried to help you out of this...

89
00:09:03,717 --> 00:09:06,447
but if you ask for jail time,
I'm gonna file a motion to dismiss.

90
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,385
- You won't get it.
- I will get it.

91
00:09:08,456 --> 00:09:10,390
And if the M.T.D. is denied,
I'll file a motion...

92
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:13,291
seeking to obtain
an evidentiary ruling in advance.

93
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,726
And after that, I'm gonna file
against pretrial confinement.

94
00:09:15,796 --> 00:09:18,321
And you're gonna spend the next three
months going blind on paperwork...

95
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,028
because a signalman second-class bought
and smoked a dime bag of oregano.

96
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,628
Let's go! Let's get two!

97
00:09:25,706 --> 00:09:28,140
B misdemeanor,
20 days in the brig.

98
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:30,473
C misdemeanor,
15 days restricted duty.

99
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,971
I don't know why
I'm agreeing to this.

100
00:09:34,048 --> 00:09:36,312
'Cause you have wisdom
beyond your years.

101
00:09:40,221 --> 00:09:41,882
Morning.

102
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,651
Morning, Captain.

103
00:09:43,724 --> 00:09:45,248
How's the baby, Sam?

104
00:09:45,326 --> 00:09:48,523
I think she's getting ready
to say her first word any day now.

105
00:09:48,596 --> 00:09:50,188
How can you tell?

106
00:09:50,264 --> 00:09:53,893
She just looks
like she has something to say.

107
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,562
Excuse me.
I'm sorry I'm late.

108
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,628
It's all right, Danny.
I know you don't have a good excuse...

109
00:09:58,706 --> 00:10:00,765
so I won't force you
to come up with a bad one.

110
00:10:00,841 --> 00:10:03,776
- Thank you, sir.
- This first one's for you.

111
00:10:04,845 --> 00:10:07,211
Seems you're moving up
in the world.

112
00:10:07,281 --> 00:10:09,215
Been requested by Division.

113
00:10:10,117 --> 00:10:12,051
Requested to do what?

114
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:14,485
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

115
00:10:14,555 --> 00:10:18,616
A Marine corporal named Dawson illegally
fires a round from his weapon...

116
00:10:18,692 --> 00:10:21,559
over the fence line
and into Cuban territory.

117
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:23,529
- What's a fence line?
- Sam.

118
00:10:23,597 --> 00:10:27,795
A big wall separating the good guys
from the bad guys.

119
00:10:27,868 --> 00:10:31,133
- Teacher's pet.
- P.F.C. William Santiago...

120
00:10:31,205 --> 00:10:34,538
threatens to rat on Dawson
to Naval Investigative Service.

121
00:10:34,608 --> 00:10:36,633
Dawson and another member
of his squad...

122
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:40,669
P.F.C. Louden Downey,
go into Santiago's room...

123
00:10:40,748 --> 00:10:44,149
tie him up,
stuff a rag down his throat...

124
00:10:44,218 --> 00:10:46,311
and an hour later, Santiago's dead.

125
00:10:46,387 --> 00:10:50,084
Attending physician says the rag
was treated with some kind of toxin.

126
00:10:50,157 --> 00:10:51,385
They poisoned the rag?

127
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:54,393
- Not according to them.
- What did they say?

128
00:10:54,461 --> 00:10:57,089
Not much.
They're being flown up here tomorrow...

129
00:10:57,164 --> 00:11:00,622
and on Wednesday at 0600, you'll catch
a transport down to Cuba for the day...

130
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,635
to find out what you can.

131
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:06,400
Meantime, go and see
Lieutenant Commander Joanne Galloway...

132
00:11:07,942 --> 00:11:09,603
with Internal Affairs.

133
00:11:09,677 --> 00:11:11,201
Any questions?

134
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:15,305
Uh, the flight to Cuba-
Was that 0600 in the morning, sir?

135
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,850
Seems important to Division
that this one be handled by the book.

136
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:22,946
So I'm assigning co-counsel.
Any volunteers?

137
00:11:24,647 --> 00:11:25,447
No!

138
00:11:25,626 --> 00:11:27,617
I got a stack of papers on my desk
about a mile high.

139
00:11:27,695 --> 00:11:29,629
- Work with Kaffee on this.
- Doing what?

140
00:11:29,697 --> 00:11:31,927
Kaffee will have this done
in about four days.

141
00:11:31,999 --> 00:11:35,264
Doing various administrative things.

142
00:11:35,336 --> 00:11:37,270
Backup, whatever.

143
00:11:37,338 --> 00:11:39,898
In other words, I have
no responsibilities here whatsoever.

144
00:11:39,974 --> 00:11:41,464
Right.

145
00:11:41,542 --> 00:11:43,635
My kind of case.

146
00:11:44,712 --> 00:11:46,703
Right.

147
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,271
Okay, but I've got to have
that report by Wednesday.

148
00:11:55,656 --> 00:11:58,386
- Hi.
- Hold on. Hi.

149
00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:00,791
Daniel Kaffee.
I was told to me with, uh-

150
00:12:08,702 --> 00:12:11,170
Lieutenant Commander Galloway.

151
00:12:13,407 --> 00:12:14,669
About a briefing?

152
00:12:14,742 --> 00:12:16,676
I'll call you back.

153
00:12:19,413 --> 00:12:21,347
You're the attorney Division assigned?

154
00:12:22,249 --> 00:12:24,183
I'm lead counsel.
This is Sam Weinberg.

155
00:12:24,251 --> 00:12:26,412
I have no responsibilities here
whatsoever.

156
00:12:26,487 --> 00:12:28,648
Come in, please. Have a seat.

157
00:12:39,099 --> 00:12:41,260
Lieutenant, how long
have you been in the Navy?

158
00:12:42,936 --> 00:12:44,870
Going on nine months now.

159
00:12:44,938 --> 00:12:47,532
And how long have you been
out of law school?

160
00:12:48,742 --> 00:12:50,209
A little over a year.

161
00:12:50,277 --> 00:12:52,370
I see.

162
00:12:53,113 --> 00:12:54,705
Have I done something wrong?

163
00:12:54,782 --> 00:12:57,444
No. It’s just that when I petition
Division to have counsel assigned...

164
00:12:57,518 --> 00:12:59,509
I was hoping I'd be taken seriously.

165
00:12:59,586 --> 00:13:02,282
No offense taken,
in case you were wondering.

166
00:13:02,356 --> 00:13:04,221
Commander,
Lieutenant Kaffee is generally...

167
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,657
considered the best litigator
in our office.

168
00:13:06,727 --> 00:13:09,958
He's successfully plea-bargained
44 cases in nine months.

169
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,021
One more,
I get a set of steak knives.

170
00:13:12,099 --> 00:13:13,896
Have you ever been in a courtroom?

171
00:13:13,967 --> 00:13:16,492
I once had
my driver's license suspended.

172
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,538
Commander, from what I understand,
if this thing goes to court...

173
00:13:18,605 --> 00:13:20,766
they won’t need a lawyer,
they'll need a priest.

174
00:13:21,408 --> 00:13:23,342
No, they'll need a lawyer.

175
00:13:24,411 --> 00:13:26,470
Dawson's family's been contacted.

176
00:13:26,547 --> 00:13:30,074
Downey's closest living relative
is Ginny Miller, his aunt.

177
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:33,051
She hasn't been contacted yet.
Would you like me to take care of that?

178
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,610
Sure. If you feel like it.

179
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,324
One of the people
you'll be seeing down there...

180
00:13:38,392 --> 00:13:40,451
is the barracks C.O.,
Colonel Nathan Jessup.

181
00:13:40,527 --> 00:13:42,654
I assume you’ve heard of him.

182
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,163
Who hasn't?

183
00:13:45,232 --> 00:13:47,826
He's been in the papers lately.
He's expected to be appointed...

184
00:13:47,901 --> 00:13:50,734
director of operations
of National Security Council.

185
00:13:50,804 --> 00:13:52,101
- Really?
- These are the letters...

186
00:13:52,172 --> 00:13:54,470
that Santiago wrote
in his eight months at Gitmo.

187
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:57,009
- That's Guantanamo Bay.
- I knew that one.

188
00:13:57,077 --> 00:14:00,604
He wrote to the fleet commander
to the commandant of the Marine Corps.

189
00:14:00,681 --> 00:14:03,616
Even his senator. He wanted
to be transferred off the base.

190
00:14:03,684 --> 00:14:05,618
No one was listening.
Are you with me?

191
00:14:05,686 --> 00:14:07,586
Yeah.

192
00:14:08,822 --> 00:14:10,813
Finally, he wrote
to the Naval Investigative Service...

193
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,917
where he offered information about
Corporal Dawson's fence line shooting...

194
00:14:13,994 --> 00:14:16,622
in exchange for a transfer.

195
00:14:16,697 --> 00:14:19,325
Right. Is that all?

196
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,334
Lieutenant,
this letter makes it look like...

197
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,836
your client had a motive
to kill Santiago.

198
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:27,169
Got you.
And Santiago is who?

199
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,833
The victim.

200
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,537
Write that down.
Am I correct to assume these letters...

201
00:14:31,612 --> 00:14:34,513
don't paint a flattering picture
of Marine Corps life at Guantanamo Bay?

202
00:14:34,581 --> 00:14:36,048
- Yes, among-
- Am I further right in assuming...

203
00:14:36,116 --> 00:14:39,950
investigation of this incident might
embarrass the Security Council guy?

204
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,011
- Colonel Jessup.
- Twelve years.

205
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,022
Sorry?

206
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,286
I'll get them to drop the conspiracy
and conduct unbecoming.

207
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,123
Twelve years.

208
00:14:48,195 --> 00:14:51,824
You haven't talked to a witness
or looked at a piece of paper.

209
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:53,958
Pretty impressive, huh?

210
00:14:54,034 --> 00:14:55,729
You're gonna have
to go deeper than that.

211
00:14:55,803 --> 00:14:58,567
Do you have some sort of jurisdiction
here that I should know about?

212
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,437
My job is to make sure
that you do your job.

213
00:15:01,508 --> 00:15:03,476
I'm special counsel
for Internal Affairs...

214
00:15:03,544 --> 00:15:06,911
so my jurisdiction’s pretty much
in your face.

215
00:15:09,082 --> 00:15:12,142
Read the letters. I'll expect
your report when you return from Cuba.

216
00:15:12,219 --> 00:15:14,881
- Sure.
- You're dismissed.

217
00:15:17,157 --> 00:15:19,489
I always forget that part.

218
00:15:21,261 --> 00:15:24,025
He's a little preoccupied.

219
00:15:24,097 --> 00:15:27,260
Team's playing Bethesda Medical
next week.

220
00:15:27,334 --> 00:15:29,268
Tell your friend
not to get cute down there.

221
00:15:29,336 --> 00:15:31,668
The Marines in Guantanamo
are fanatical.

222
00:15:31,738 --> 00:15:33,035
About what?

223
00:15:33,774 --> 00:15:35,435
About being Marines.

224
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:36,533
Dear sir...

225
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:39,374
my name is P.F.C. William T. Santiago.

226
00:15:39,446 --> 00:15:41,778
I'm a Marine stationed
at Marine barracks...

227
00:15:41,849 --> 00:15:45,046
Rifle Security Company Windward,
Second Platoon Bravo.

228
00:15:45,118 --> 00:15:48,918
I'm writing to inform you of my problems
with my unit here in Cuba...

229
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,616
and to ask for your help.

230
00:15:50,691 --> 00:15:54,024
I've fallen out on runs before
for several reasons...

231
00:15:54,094 --> 00:15:56,062
such as feeling dizzy or nauseated.

232
00:15:56,129 --> 00:15:59,860
But on May 18, I'd fallen back
about 20 or 30 yards...

233
00:15:59,933 --> 00:16:02,458
going down rocky unstable hill.

234
00:16:02,536 --> 00:16:05,505
My sergeant grabbed me
and pushed me down the hill.

235
00:16:05,572 --> 00:16:09,474
Then I saw all black, and the last thing
I remembered was hitting the deck.

236
00:16:09,543 --> 00:16:12,910
I was brought to the hospital where
I was told I just had heat exhaustion.

237
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,607
I ask you to help me.

238
00:16:14,681 --> 00:16:18,139
Please, sir. I just need
to be transferred out of R.S.C.

239
00:16:18,218 --> 00:16:21,051
Sincerely,
P.F.C. William T. Santiago...

240
00:16:21,121 --> 00:16:22,713
U.S. Marine Corps.

241
00:16:22,789 --> 00:16:25,724
P.S. In exchange for my transfer
off the base...

242
00:16:25,792 --> 00:16:27,783
I'm willing to provide you
with information about-

243
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:32,127
"The illegal fence line shooting
that occurred the night of August 2."

244
00:16:33,066 --> 00:16:37,435
Who the fuck
is P.F.C. William T. Santiago?

245
00:16:37,504 --> 00:16:40,598
Private Santiago is a member
of Second Platoon Bravo, sir.

246
00:16:40,674 --> 00:16:44,872
Yeah. Well, apparently he's not
very happy down here in Shangri-la...

247
00:16:44,945 --> 00:16:47,812
because he's written letters
to everybody but Santa Claus...

248
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:50,008
asking for a transfer.

249
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:53,018
And now he's telling tales
about a fence line shooting.

250
00:16:54,087 --> 00:16:55,679
Matthew?

251
00:16:55,756 --> 00:16:58,316
I'm appalled, sir.

252
00:16:59,126 --> 00:17:01,560
You're appalled.

253
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:06,156
This kid broke the chain of command
and ratted on a member of his unit...

254
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:09,031
to say nothing of the fact
that he is a U.S. Marine...

255
00:17:09,102 --> 00:17:11,832
and it would appear he can't run
from here to there...

256
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,669
without collapsing
from heat exhaustion.

257
00:17:14,741 --> 00:17:18,006
What the fuck is going on
in Bravo Company, Matthew?

258
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:21,104
Colonel, I think it would be better
to hold this discussion in private.

259
00:17:21,181 --> 00:17:25,311
That won't be necessary, Colonel.
I can handle the situation, sir.

260
00:17:25,385 --> 00:17:29,116
The same way you handled Curtis Bell?
Don't interrupt me, Lieutenant!

261
00:17:29,189 --> 00:17:32,716
- I'm still your superior officer.
- And I'm yours, Matthew.

262
00:17:34,895 --> 00:17:37,955
I wanna know
what we're going to do about this.

263
00:17:38,031 --> 00:17:40,966
I think Santiago should be transferred
off the base immediately.

264
00:17:41,034 --> 00:17:42,661
He's that bad, huh?

265
00:17:42,736 --> 00:17:44,863
Not only that. But word
of this letter is bound to get out.

266
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,872
He's gonna get his ass whipped.

267
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,967
Hmm. Transfer Santiago.

268
00:17:51,044 --> 00:17:54,571
Yes. I'm sure you’re right.

269
00:17:54,648 --> 00:17:57,139
I'm sure that's the thing to do.

270
00:17:58,852 --> 00:18:02,754
Wait. I've got a better idea.

271
00:18:02,823 --> 00:18:05,758
Let's transfer the whole squad
off the base.

272
00:18:05,826 --> 00:18:08,920
Let's- On second thought, Windward-

273
00:18:08,996 --> 00:18:13,228
Let's transfer the whole
Windward Division off the base.

274
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,929
John, go on out there
and get those boys down off the fence.

275
00:18:17,004 --> 00:18:19,495
They're packing their bags. Tom.

276
00:18:20,774 --> 00:18:23,174
- Sir.
- Get me the president on the phone.

277
00:18:23,243 --> 00:18:26,337
We're surrendering
our position in Cuba.

278
00:18:26,413 --> 00:18:28,847
- Yes, sir.
- Wait a minute, Tom.

279
00:18:28,915 --> 00:18:30,849
Don't get the president just yet.

280
00:18:30,917 --> 00:18:34,546
Maybe we should
consider this for a second.

281
00:18:34,621 --> 00:18:36,885
- Dismissed, Tom.
- Yes, sir.

282
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:41,859
Maybe- and I'm just
spit-balling here-

283
00:18:41,928 --> 00:18:46,956
Maybe we have a responsibility
as officers to train Santiago.

284
00:18:47,034 --> 00:18:51,198
Maybe we as officers
have a responsibility to this country...

285
00:18:51,271 --> 00:18:54,570
to see that the men and women
charged with its security...

286
00:18:54,641 --> 00:18:56,700
are trained professionals.

287
00:18:56,777 --> 00:19:00,713
Yes, I'm certain
that I read that somewhere once.

288
00:19:00,781 --> 00:19:03,375
And now I'm thinking,
Colonel Markinson...

289
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:07,784
that your suggestion
of transferring Santiago...

290
00:19:07,854 --> 00:19:11,085
while expeditious
and certainly painless...

291
00:19:11,158 --> 00:19:13,649
might not be,
in a manner of speaking...

292
00:19:13,727 --> 00:19:16,628
the American way.

293
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,495
Santiago stays where he is.

294
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:23,533
We're gonna train the lad.

295
00:19:23,603 --> 00:19:26,538
John, you're in charge.

296
00:19:26,606 --> 00:19:29,769
Santiago doesn't make 4-6-4-6...

297
00:19:29,843 --> 00:19:33,506
on his next proficiency
and conduct report...

298
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,912
I'm going to blame you.

299
00:19:35,982 --> 00:19:38,610
- Then I'm going to kill you.
- Yes, sir.

300
00:19:38,685 --> 00:19:41,279
I think that's a mistake, Colonel.

301
00:19:42,689 --> 00:19:46,819
Matthew, I think I will
have that word in private with you now.

302
00:19:46,893 --> 00:19:50,852
John, that's all. Why don't we meet
at the "O" club and have lunch...

303
00:19:50,931 --> 00:19:53,525
and we'll talk about the training
of young William?

304
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,330
I'd be delighted to hear any
suggestions that you might have, sir.

305
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,371
- Dismissed.
- Yes, sir.

306
00:20:02,142 --> 00:20:05,339
Matthew, sit down. Please.

307
00:20:10,517 --> 00:20:13,111
What do you think of Kendrick?

308
00:20:13,186 --> 00:20:15,017
My opinion of him has nothing to do-

309
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:18,251
I think he's pretty much
of a weasel myself...

310
00:20:18,325 --> 00:20:20,316
but he's an awfully good officer.

311
00:20:20,393 --> 00:20:24,830
And in the end, we see eye-to-eye on
the best way to run a Marine Corps unit.

312
00:20:24,898 --> 00:20:28,425
We're in the business
of saving lives, Matthew.

313
00:20:28,502 --> 00:20:32,199
That is a responsibility
that we have to take pretty seriously.

314
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:36,606
And I believe that taking a Marine
who is not quite up to the job...

315
00:20:36,676 --> 00:20:39,144
and shipping him off
to another assignment...

316
00:20:39,212 --> 00:20:41,203
puts lives in danger.

317
00:20:41,982 --> 00:20:44,246
Sit down, Matthew.

318
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,819
We go back a while.

319
00:20:55,896 --> 00:20:59,388
We went to the Academy together.
We were commissioned together.

320
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,934
We did our tours in Vietnam together.

321
00:21:02,002 --> 00:21:04,368
But I've been promoted
up through the chain...

322
00:21:04,437 --> 00:21:07,338
with greater speed and success
than you have.

323
00:21:07,407 --> 00:21:10,376
Now, if that’s a source of tension...

324
00:21:10,443 --> 00:21:12,411
or embarrassment for you...

325
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,242
I don't give a shit.

326
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:19,513
We're in the business of saving lives,
Lieutenant Colonel Markinson.

327
00:21:19,586 --> 00:21:23,682
Don't ever question my orders
in front of another officer.

328
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,144
All the paperwork's in order.

329
00:21:46,213 --> 00:21:48,147
- Step over there.
- Yes, sir.

330
00:21:52,819 --> 00:21:55,583
Hal, is this Washington, D.C.?

331
00:21:55,655 --> 00:21:57,282
All right. Let's move.

332
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:58,790
Yes, sir.

333
00:22:05,665 --> 00:22:08,600
- Got all of that one.
- Excuse me.

334
00:22:08,668 --> 00:22:12,263
I wanted to talk to you about
Corporal Dawson and Private Downey.

335
00:22:12,339 --> 00:22:14,933
- Say again?
- Dawson and Downey.

336
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:18,234
Those names sound like
they should mean something to me-

337
00:22:18,311 --> 00:22:21,109
Dawson, Downey - your clients.

338
00:22:21,181 --> 00:22:24,480
The Cuba thing. Yes!
Dawson and Downey. Right.

339
00:22:27,687 --> 00:22:29,746
I've done something wrong again,
haven't I?

340
00:22:29,823 --> 00:22:31,814
I was just wondering
why two guys have been locked up...

341
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,656
since this morning while their lawyer's
outside hitting a ball.

342
00:22:36,663 --> 00:22:38,358
We need the practice.

343
00:22:38,431 --> 00:22:40,023
That wasn't funny.

344
00:22:40,767 --> 00:22:42,132
It was a little funny.

345
00:22:42,202 --> 00:22:45,501
Would you be very insulted
if I recommended to your supervisor...

346
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,506
that he assign different counsel?

347
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:51,010
- Why?
- I don't think you’re fit to handle it.

348
00:22:51,077 --> 00:22:54,843
You don't even know me.
Ordinarily, it takes someone hours...

349
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:57,543
to discover I'm not fit
to handle a defense.

350
00:22:59,286 --> 00:23:02,653
Oh, come on.
That was damn funny.

351
00:23:05,659 --> 00:23:06,819
You're wrong.

352
00:23:07,894 --> 00:23:09,885
I do know you.

353
00:23:09,963 --> 00:23:13,797
Daniel Alistair Kaffee,
born June 8, 1964...

354
00:23:13,867 --> 00:23:15,801
at Boston Mercy Hospital.

355
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:17,200
Your father's Lionel Kaffee...

356
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:20,762
former Navy judge advocate and
attorney general of the United States.

357
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,398
Died 1985.

358
00:23:22,475 --> 00:23:25,205
You went to Harvard law.
Then you joined the Navy...

359
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:28,042
probably because that's
what your father wanted you to do.

360
00:23:28,114 --> 00:23:31,447
And now you're just treading water
for three years in the JAG Corps.

361
00:23:31,518 --> 00:23:35,010
Just laying low till
you can get out and get a real job.

362
00:23:35,088 --> 00:23:38,649
If that’s the situation, that's fine.
I won't tell anyone.

363
00:23:38,725 --> 00:23:41,023
But it's my feeling that
if this case is handled in the same...

364
00:23:41,094 --> 00:23:43,961
fast-food, slick-ass,
Persian bazaar manner...

365
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,964
with which you seem
to handle everything else...

366
00:23:46,032 --> 00:23:47,693
then something's gonna get missed.

367
00:23:47,767 --> 00:23:50,429
And I wouldn't be doing my job
if I allowed Dawson and Downey...

368
00:23:50,503 --> 00:23:53,063
to spend any more time in prison
than absolutely necessary...

369
00:23:53,139 --> 00:23:56,233
because their attorney had predetermined
the path of least resistance.

370
00:23:59,012 --> 00:24:00,445
Wow.

371
00:24:01,581 --> 00:24:04,049
I'm sexually aroused, Commander.

372
00:24:04,751 --> 00:24:07,015
I don't think
your clients murdered anyone.

373
00:24:07,087 --> 00:24:08,452
What are you basing this on?

374
00:24:08,521 --> 00:24:10,318
There was no intent.

375
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:13,223
The doctor's report says
Santiago died of asphyxiation...

376
00:24:13,293 --> 00:24:15,227
brought on by acute lactic acidosis...

377
00:24:15,295 --> 00:24:19,129
and that the nature of the acidosis
strongly suggests poison.

378
00:24:19,199 --> 00:24:21,963
I don't know what any of that means,
but it sounds pretty bad.

379
00:24:22,035 --> 00:24:23,969
Santiago died at 1:00 a. m.

380
00:24:24,037 --> 00:24:26,835
At 3:00, the doctor wasn’t able
to determine the cause of death.

381
00:24:26,906 --> 00:24:29,136
Two hours later,
he said it was poison.

382
00:24:29,209 --> 00:24:31,734
Oh, now I see what you’re saying.

383
00:24:31,811 --> 00:24:35,110
It had to be Professor Plum
in the library with a candlestick.

384
00:24:35,181 --> 00:24:37,649
- I'm gonna talk to your supervisor.
- Okay.

385
00:24:37,717 --> 00:24:39,878
Go straight up Pennsylvania Avenue.

386
00:24:39,953 --> 00:24:42,444
It's the big white house
with the pillars in front.

387
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:45,719
- Thank you.
- I don't think you’ll have much luck.

388
00:24:45,792 --> 00:24:47,225
I was assigned by Division.

389
00:24:47,293 --> 00:24:50,353
Somebody over there thinks
I'm a pretty good lawyer.

390
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:53,922
So while I appreciate your interest
and admire your enthusiasm...

391
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,468
I think I can handle things myself.

392
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:58,629
You know what a Code Red is?

393
00:25:02,509 --> 00:25:04,636
What a pity.

394
00:25:14,854 --> 00:25:17,322
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.

395
00:25:18,258 --> 00:25:19,919
Officer on deck!

396
00:25:19,993 --> 00:25:22,154
Sir, Lance Corporal
Harold W. Dawson, sir!

397
00:25:22,228 --> 00:25:24,423
Rifle Security Company Windward,
Second Platoon Bravo.

398
00:25:24,497 --> 00:25:27,762
Someone hasn't been working
and playing well with others, Harold.

399
00:25:27,834 --> 00:25:29,768
Sir, yes, sir!

400
00:25:31,538 --> 00:25:33,870
Sir, P.F.C. Louden Downey, sir!

401
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:37,969
I'm Daniel Kaffee.
This is Sam Weinberg.

402
00:25:38,044 --> 00:25:39,204
Sit down.

403
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:49,317
- This your signature?
- Yes, sir.

404
00:25:49,389 --> 00:25:51,186
You don't have to call me "sir. "
Is this your signature?

405
00:25:51,257 --> 00:25:52,451
Sir, yes, sir.

406
00:25:52,525 --> 00:25:55,392
You certainly don't need
to do it twice in one sentence.

407
00:25:55,462 --> 00:25:59,057
- What's a Code Red?
- It is a disciplinary engagement.

408
00:25:59,132 --> 00:26:00,565
What's that mean?

409
00:26:00,633 --> 00:26:04,501
A Marine falls out of line, it's up to
the men in his unit to get him on track.

410
00:26:04,571 --> 00:26:08,063
- What's a garden variety Code Red?
- Sir?

411
00:26:08,141 --> 00:26:12,077
Harold, you say, "sir," and
I turn around and look for my father.

412
00:26:12,145 --> 00:26:14,705
Danny, Daniel, Kaffee.

413
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:17,841
Garden variety. Typical.
What's basic Code Red?

414
00:26:17,917 --> 00:26:20,545
Sir, a Marine refuses to bathe
on a regular basis...

415
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,214
the men in his squad
will give him a G.I. shower.

416
00:26:23,289 --> 00:26:24,551
What's that?

417
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:27,149
Scrub brushes,
Brillo pads, steel wool.

418
00:26:27,227 --> 00:26:28,558
Beautiful.

419
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:31,153
Was the attack on Santiago
a Code Red?

420
00:26:31,231 --> 00:26:32,926
Yes, sir.

421
00:26:38,171 --> 00:26:41,334
Does he ever talk?

422
00:26:41,407 --> 00:26:44,706
Sir, P.F.C. Downey will answer
any direct questions you ask him.

423
00:26:44,777 --> 00:26:46,335
Swell.

424
00:26:47,947 --> 00:26:50,711
Private Downey, the rag
you stuffed in Santiago's mouth-

425
00:26:50,783 --> 00:26:52,717
- Was there poison on it?
- No, sir.

426
00:26:52,785 --> 00:26:55,276
Silver polish,
turpentine, antifreeze?

427
00:26:55,355 --> 00:26:57,721
No, sir. We were just
gonna shave his head, sir.

428
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:00,588
When all of the sudden-

429
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,094
We saw blood dripping
down his mouth...

430
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:07,361
and we pulled the tape off and
there was blood all down his face, sir.

431
00:27:07,433 --> 00:27:10,698
That's when Lance Corporal Dawson
called the ambulance.

432
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,465
Did anyone see you call
the ambulance?

433
00:27:14,474 --> 00:27:15,634
No, sir.

434
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,873
Were you there
when the ambulance got there?

435
00:27:19,946 --> 00:27:22,312
Yes, sir. That's when
we were taken under arrest.

436
00:27:22,382 --> 00:27:27,183
The night of August 2, did you fire
a shot across the fence line into Cuba?

437
00:27:29,122 --> 00:27:30,555
- Yes, sir.
- Why?

438
00:27:30,623 --> 00:27:33,421
- My mirror engaged, sir.
- His mirror?

439
00:27:33,493 --> 00:27:37,361
Every American sentry post has
a Cuban counterpart, called "mirrors. "

440
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:40,888
Lance Corporal's claiming that
his mirror was about to fire at him.

441
00:27:40,967 --> 00:27:43,435
Santiago's letter to the N.I.S...

442
00:27:43,503 --> 00:27:45,971
said you fired illegally.

443
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:49,975
He's saying that the guy, the mirror-

444
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,635
He never made a move.

445
00:27:58,084 --> 00:28:00,018
You see what I'm getting at?

446
00:28:01,087 --> 00:28:04,318
If Santiago didn't have anything on you,
then why did you give him a Code Red?

447
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:06,585
'Cause he broke
the chain of command, sir.

448
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:09,628
- He what?
- He went outside of his unit, sir.

449
00:28:09,696 --> 00:28:12,096
If he had a problem,
he should have spoken to me, sir.

450
00:28:12,165 --> 00:28:15,191
- Then his sergeant, then commander-
- Yeah. All right.

451
00:28:15,268 --> 00:28:17,930
Did you assault Santiago
with the intent of killing him?

452
00:28:18,004 --> 00:28:19,665
- No, sir.
- What was your intent?

453
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:22,503
- To train him, sir.
- Train him to do what?

454
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:27,103
Train him to think of his unit
before himself- to respect the code.

455
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,977
What's the code?

456
00:28:29,048 --> 00:28:31,016
Unit, Corps, God, Country.

457
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,346
I beg your pardon?

458
00:28:32,418 --> 00:28:37,788
Unit, Corps, God, Country, sir.

459
00:28:53,673 --> 00:28:56,574
The government
of the United States...

460
00:28:56,643 --> 00:28:59,441
wants to charge you two
with murder...

461
00:28:59,512 --> 00:29:01,503
and you want me
to go to the prosecutor...

462
00:29:01,581 --> 00:29:05,142
with "Unit, Corps, God, Country"?

463
00:29:05,218 --> 00:29:07,209
That's our code, sir.

464
00:29:11,224 --> 00:29:13,055
It's your code.

465
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:15,686
We'll be back.

466
00:29:15,762 --> 00:29:19,630
You guys need anything- books,
papers, cigarettes, ham sandwich?

467
00:29:19,699 --> 00:29:21,997
Sir, no, thank you, sir.

468
00:29:22,068 --> 00:29:25,868
Harold, I think there's a concept
you better start warming up to.

469
00:29:25,938 --> 00:29:27,200
Sir?

470
00:29:27,273 --> 00:29:29,867
I'm the only friend you've got.

471
00:29:45,024 --> 00:29:46,286
Smiling Jack Ross.

472
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:48,589
- Welcome to the big time.
- You think so?

473
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:52,529
Let's hope, for Dawson and Downey, you
practice law better than play softball.

474
00:29:52,598 --> 00:29:56,125
Unfortunately for those two, I don't
do anything better than play softball.

475
00:29:56,202 --> 00:29:57,726
- I'm out of here, Janelle.
- Bye.

476
00:29:57,804 --> 00:30:00,102
- See you when I get back from Cuba.
- Say hi to Castro for me.

477
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:02,471
Will do.
What are we looking at?

478
00:30:02,542 --> 00:30:05,705
They plead guilty, we drop
the conspiracy and conduct unbecoming.

479
00:30:05,778 --> 00:30:08,042
- Twenty years. They're home in half.
- I want 12.

480
00:30:08,114 --> 00:30:10,082
- Can't do it.
- They called the ambulance.

481
00:30:10,149 --> 00:30:13,482
I don't care if they called
the Avon lady. They killed a Marine.

482
00:30:13,553 --> 00:30:15,953
The rag was tested for poison.
The autopsy, lab reports.

483
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,683
They say the same thing:
maybe, maybe not.

484
00:30:17,757 --> 00:30:20,817
Chief of Internal Medicine
at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Hospital...

485
00:30:20,893 --> 00:30:22,417
says he's sure.

486
00:30:22,495 --> 00:30:24,554
What do you know about Code Reds?

487
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,063
Oh, man.

488
00:30:28,568 --> 00:30:31,059
- We off the record?
- Tell me.

489
00:30:32,338 --> 00:30:34,272
I'm gonna give you the 12 years.

490
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:37,503
Before you go getting yourself into
trouble tomorrow, you should know...

491
00:30:37,577 --> 00:30:39,704
the platoon commander,
Lieutenant Jonathan Kendrick...

492
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:42,714
held a meeting with the men
and specifically...

493
00:30:42,782 --> 00:30:45,216
told them not to touch Santiago.

494
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,653
- We still playing hoops tomorrow night?
- Do we have a deal?

495
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:53,419
I'll talk to you when I get back.

496
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:59,660
- Hi there.
- Any luck getting me replaced?

497
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:02,963
Is there anyone in this command you
don't either drink or play ball with?

498
00:31:03,035 --> 00:31:04,969
- Commander-
- Listen. I came to make peace.

499
00:31:05,037 --> 00:31:09,064
Got off on the wrong foot.
What do you say? Friends?

500
00:31:09,142 --> 00:31:12,202
I brought Downey some comic books
he was asking for.

501
00:31:12,278 --> 00:31:14,712
The kid, Kaffee,
I swear he doesn't know where he is.

502
00:31:14,781 --> 00:31:17,113
- Doesn't even know why he's arrested.
- Commander.

503
00:31:17,183 --> 00:31:18,946
- You can call me Joanne.
-Joanne.

504
00:31:19,018 --> 00:31:21,248
- Or Jo.
- Yes.

505
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,312
Jo, if you ever speak to a client
of mine again without my permission...

506
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:25,948
I'll have you disbarred.

507
00:31:26,025 --> 00:31:29,256
- Friends?
- I had authorization.

508
00:31:29,328 --> 00:31:32,092
- From where?
- Downey's closest living relative.

509
00:31:32,165 --> 00:31:35,726
Ginny Miller.
His aunt on his mother's side.

510
00:31:35,802 --> 00:31:38,134
You got authorization
from Aunt Ginny?

511
00:31:38,204 --> 00:31:40,195
I gave her a call
like you asked.

512
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:42,673
Very nice woman.
We spoke for about an hour.

513
00:31:42,742 --> 00:31:45,267
You got authorization
from Aunt Ginny.

514
00:31:45,344 --> 00:31:48,006
Perfectly within my province.

515
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,514
Does Aunt Ginny have a barn?
We could hold the trial there.

516
00:31:50,583 --> 00:31:53,711
I can sew the costumes.
Maybe his Uncle Goober can be the judge.

517
00:31:57,156 --> 00:31:59,681
I'm going to Cuba with you tomorrow.

518
00:32:01,694 --> 00:32:04,492
And the hits just keep on coming.

519
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:31,081
- How's it going, Luther?
- Another day, another dollar, captain.

520
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:34,354
- You gotta play them as they lay.
- What goes around comes around.

521
00:32:34,427 --> 00:32:37,863
- Can't beat 'em, join 'em.
- At least I got my health.

522
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:41,696
Well, then you got everything.
See you tomorrow, Luther.

523
00:32:41,767 --> 00:32:43,701
Not if I see you first.

524
00:32:46,038 --> 00:32:48,029
Now don't forget.
When Sally gets back, you're my witness.

525
00:32:48,107 --> 00:32:50,405
The baby spoke.
My daughter said a word.

526
00:32:50,476 --> 00:32:52,774
Your daughter made a sound, Sam.
I'm not sure it was a word.

527
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:54,779
Come on, now.
It was definitely a word.

528
00:32:57,683 --> 00:33:00,345
You heard her. The girl sat here,
pointed and said, " Pa. "

529
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:02,512
She did. She said, " Pa. "

530
00:33:02,588 --> 00:33:04,818
She was pointing at a mailbox, Sam.

531
00:33:04,891 --> 00:33:08,850
That's right, pointing as if to say,
" Pa, look. A mailbox. "

532
00:33:16,402 --> 00:33:19,530
Jack Ross came to see me today.
He offered me the 12 years.

533
00:33:19,605 --> 00:33:22,301
- Oh, that's what you wanted, right?
- I know, I know.

534
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:27,938
I mean, I guess I'll take it.
I'll take it.

535
00:33:29,015 --> 00:33:32,143
- So-
- It took about 45 seconds.

536
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:33,913
He barely put up a fight.

537
00:33:33,986 --> 00:33:36,546
Danny, take the 12 years.
It's a gift.

538
00:33:37,623 --> 00:33:39,557
You don't believe their story,
do you?

539
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:41,786
You think they ought to go to jail
for the rest of their lives.

540
00:33:41,861 --> 00:33:44,056
I believe every word of their story...

541
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:47,156
and I think they ought to go to jail
for the rest of their lives.

542
00:33:52,605 --> 00:33:54,539
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

543
00:33:54,607 --> 00:33:57,235
Don't forget to wear the whites.
Very hot down there.

544
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,175
I don't like the whites.

545
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:01,611
Nobody likes the whites,
but we're going to Cuba.

546
00:34:01,681 --> 00:34:04,377
- You got Dramamine?
- Dramamine keeps you cool?

547
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:08,011
No, Dramamine keeps you from
throwing up. You get sick when you fly.

548
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:11,454
I get sick when I fly because I'm afraid
of crashing into a large mountain.

549
00:34:11,524 --> 00:34:13,082
I don't think Dramamine will help.

550
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:16,527
I got some oregano.
I hear that works pretty good.

551
00:34:19,966 --> 00:34:23,197
You know, Ross said the strangest thing
to me right before I left.

552
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:26,670
He said the platoon commander
Lieutenant Jonathan Kendrick...

553
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:30,368
had a meeting with the men
and told them not to touch Santiago.

554
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:31,842
So?

555
00:34:33,212 --> 00:34:35,578
I never mentioned Kendrick.
I don't even know who he is.

556
00:34:39,218 --> 00:34:43,211
Ah, what the hell.
I'll see you tomorrow.

557
00:35:19,125 --> 00:35:21,821
Lieutenants Kaffee and Weinberg,
Commander Galloway.

558
00:35:21,894 --> 00:35:24,590
I'm Corporal Barnes. I'm to escort you
to the windward side of the base.

559
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:27,827
- Thank you.
- I got some camouflage jackets here.

560
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,028
- I suggest you both put them on.
- Camouflage jackets?

561
00:35:31,103 --> 00:35:34,231
Yes, sir. We'll be riding
pretty close to the fence line.

562
00:35:34,306 --> 00:35:36,467
The Cubans see
an officer wearing white...

563
00:35:36,542 --> 00:35:39,102
they think it might be someone
they want to take a shot at.

564
00:35:40,913 --> 00:35:43,381
Good call, Sam.

565
00:35:47,953 --> 00:35:50,581
We'll just hop on the ferry.
We'll be there in no time.

566
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:53,250
- Wait. We gotta take a boat?
- Yes, sir.

567
00:35:53,325 --> 00:35:56,954
- To get to the other side of the bay.
- Nobody said anything about a boat.

568
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:59,827
- Is there a problem, sir?
- No, no problem.

569
00:35:59,899 --> 00:36:01,662
Just not crazy about boats.

570
00:36:01,734 --> 00:36:06,000
Jesus Christ, Kaffee,
you're in the Navy, for crying out loud.

571
00:36:06,072 --> 00:36:09,633
- Nobody likes her very much.
- Yes, sir!

572
00:36:22,822 --> 00:36:25,416
Nathan Jessup. Come on in.

573
00:36:25,491 --> 00:36:29,518
Thank you, sir. Daniel Kaffee.
I'm the attorney for Dawson and Downey.

574
00:36:29,595 --> 00:36:31,961
This is
Lieutenant Commander Joanne Galloway.

575
00:36:32,031 --> 00:36:35,228
- Pleasure meeting you, Commander.
- Observing and evaluating, sir.

576
00:36:35,301 --> 00:36:37,235
Lieutenant Sam Weinberg.
He'll be assisting.

577
00:36:37,303 --> 00:36:40,033
- Sir.
- This is my X.O., Colonel Markinson...

578
00:36:40,106 --> 00:36:42,131
and platoon leader Lieutenant Kendrick.

579
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:44,699
I've asked them to join us.
Sit down, please.

580
00:36:44,777 --> 00:36:47,245
- Lieutenant Kaffee.
- Colonel Markinson.

581
00:36:47,313 --> 00:36:49,804
I had the pleasure
of meeting your father once.

582
00:36:49,882 --> 00:36:51,941
I was a teenager.
He spoke at my high school.

583
00:36:52,952 --> 00:36:54,146
Lionel Kaffee?

584
00:36:54,987 --> 00:36:56,955
- Yes, sir.
- Well, what do you know?

585
00:36:57,022 --> 00:37:01,618
John, this man's dad once made a lot of
enemies down in your neck of the woods.

586
00:37:01,694 --> 00:37:05,460
Jefferson v. Madison County
School District.

587
00:37:05,531 --> 00:37:09,865
Folks down there said a black girl
couldn't go to an all-white school.

588
00:37:09,935 --> 00:37:13,871
Lionel Kaffee said,
"Well, we'll just see about that. "

589
00:37:13,939 --> 00:37:16,499
How the hell is your dad, Danny?

590
00:37:16,575 --> 00:37:18,975
He passed away seven years ago, sir.

591
00:37:20,713 --> 00:37:23,580
Don't I feel like the fuckin' asshole.

592
00:37:23,649 --> 00:37:24,980
Not at all.

593
00:37:26,218 --> 00:37:28,311
Well, what can we do for you, Danny?

594
00:37:28,387 --> 00:37:30,321
Uh, not much, sir.

595
00:37:31,824 --> 00:37:35,726
This is really a formality
more than anything else.

596
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:39,697
JAG Corps insists that we interview
all the relevant witnesses.

597
00:37:39,765 --> 00:37:41,733
The JAG Corps can be demanding
that way.

598
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:46,267
John will take you out
and show you what you want to see.

599
00:37:46,338 --> 00:37:48,397
After that we can all
hook up for lunch.

600
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:51,705
- How does that sound? Good.
- Fine, sir.

601
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:02,253
I understand you had a meeting
with your men that afternoon.

602
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:04,653
- Yes, I did.
- What did you guys talk about?

603
00:38:04,723 --> 00:38:07,089
I told the men
that we had an informer among us...

604
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:10,151
and that despite any desire
they might have to seek retribution...

605
00:38:10,229 --> 00:38:13,721
Private Santiago
was not to be harmed in anyway.

606
00:38:13,799 --> 00:38:17,098
- What time was that meeting?
- 1600.

607
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:20,036
That's 4:00.

608
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,915
Sam, we should make sure
somebody gets this to his parents.

609
00:39:13,993 --> 00:39:17,156
- We don't need it anymore.
- Right.

610
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:20,694
Lieutenant Kendrick,
may I call you John?

611
00:39:20,766 --> 00:39:22,825
No, you may not.

612
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,029
Have I done something to offend you?

613
00:39:25,104 --> 00:39:27,197
No, I like all you Navy boys.

614
00:39:27,273 --> 00:39:31,334
Every time we gotta go someplace to
fight, you fellas always give us a ride.

615
00:39:32,711 --> 00:39:36,147
Lieutenant Kendrick,
do you think Santiago was murdered?

616
00:39:36,215 --> 00:39:39,082
Commander, I believe in God
and His Son Jesus Christ.

617
00:39:39,151 --> 00:39:41,142
And because I do, I can say this:

618
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:44,951
Private Santiago is dead,
and that is a tragedy.

619
00:39:45,024 --> 00:39:47,288
But he is dead
because he had no code.

620
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:51,659
He is dead because he had no honor,
and God was watching.

621
00:39:54,133 --> 00:39:55,896
How do you feel about that theory?

622
00:39:55,968 --> 00:39:58,198
Sounds good. Let's move on.

623
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,261
Are you planning
on doing any investigating...

624
00:40:00,339 --> 00:40:02,273
or are you just gonna take
the guided tour?

625
00:40:03,909 --> 00:40:06,707
I'm pacing myself.

626
00:40:07,546 --> 00:40:09,275
They were running around
for three hours...

627
00:40:09,348 --> 00:40:12,283
looking for anything white
they could wave in the air.

628
00:40:12,351 --> 00:40:15,650
Some of these people surrendered
to a crew from CNN.

629
00:40:16,722 --> 00:40:21,989
Well, walk softly and carry
an armored tank division, I always say.

630
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:26,693
- That was delicious. Thank you.
- My pleasure, sir.

631
00:40:26,765 --> 00:40:31,600
Colonel, I do have to ask you a couple
of questions about September 6.

632
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,262
Shoot.

633
00:40:33,339 --> 00:40:35,933
On the morning of the sixth,
you were contacted by an N.I.S. agent...

634
00:40:36,008 --> 00:40:39,444
who said that Santiago tipped him off
to an illegal fence line shooting.

635
00:40:39,511 --> 00:40:41,706
- Yes.
- Santiago would reveal the person...

636
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:44,578
- in exchange for a transfer.
- Yes.

637
00:40:47,686 --> 00:40:50,484
If you feel there are any details
that I'm missing...

638
00:40:50,556 --> 00:40:53,787
you should feel free to speak up.

639
00:40:56,362 --> 00:40:57,795
Thank you.

640
00:41:01,367 --> 00:41:04,165
Now, at this point you called
Lieutenant Colonel Markinson...

641
00:41:04,236 --> 00:41:06,568
and Lieutenant Kendrick
into your office.

642
00:41:06,638 --> 00:41:08,333
- Is that right?
- Yes.

643
00:41:08,407 --> 00:41:09,567
What happened?

644
00:41:09,641 --> 00:41:15,443
We agreed that, for his own safety,
Santiago should be transferred off base.

645
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:19,541
Santiago was set to be transferred.

646
00:41:19,618 --> 00:41:22,212
On the first available flight
to the States...

647
00:41:22,287 --> 00:41:24,414
0600 the next morning.

648
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:28,586
Five hours too late,
as it turned out.

649
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,295
Yeah.

650
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:35,231
All right. That's all I have.
Thanks very much for your time.

651
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:38,599
Corporal's waiting with the Jeep.
He'll take you back to the flight line.

652
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:40,695
- Thank you, sir.
- Wait. I've got some questions.

653
00:41:40,773 --> 00:41:42,400
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

654
00:41:42,474 --> 00:41:45,466
- No, you don't.
- On the morning that Santiago died...

655
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:49,139
did you meet with Dr. Stone
between 3:00 and 5:00?

656
00:41:49,214 --> 00:41:53,241
Of course I met with the doctor.
One of my men was dead.

657
00:41:53,318 --> 00:41:55,843
See? The man was dead. Let's go.

658
00:41:55,921 --> 00:41:59,584
I'm just wondering if you’ve ever heard
the term "Code Red. "

659
00:42:00,926 --> 00:42:02,621
I've heard the term, yes.

660
00:42:02,694 --> 00:42:05,686
This past February,
you received a cautionary memo...

661
00:42:05,764 --> 00:42:08,062
from the commander-in-chief
of the Atlantic fleet...

662
00:42:08,133 --> 00:42:10,067
warning that the practice
of enlisted men...

663
00:42:10,135 --> 00:42:13,298
disciplining their own
wasn't to be condoned by officers.

664
00:42:13,372 --> 00:42:15,897
Well, I submit to you
that whoever wrote that memo...

665
00:42:15,974 --> 00:42:17,908
has never faced the working end...

666
00:42:17,976 --> 00:42:22,037
of a Soviet-made
Cuban AK-47 assault rifle.

667
00:42:22,114 --> 00:42:25,811
However, the directive
having come from the commander...

668
00:42:25,884 --> 00:42:28,011
I gave it its due attention.

669
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:30,647
- What is your point, Jo?
- She has no point.

670
00:42:30,722 --> 00:42:32,656
She often has no point.
It's part of her charm.

671
00:42:32,724 --> 00:42:37,718
- We're out of here. Thank you.
- I think Code Reds still go on here.

672
00:42:37,796 --> 00:42:42,062
- Do Code Reds still happen here?
-Jo, he doesn't need to answer that.

673
00:42:42,134 --> 00:42:43,692
- Yes, he does.
- No, he really doesn't.

674
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:45,828
Yeah, he really does.

675
00:42:50,576 --> 00:42:52,806
You know, it just hit me.

676
00:42:53,879 --> 00:42:55,813
She outranks you, Danny.

677
00:42:55,881 --> 00:42:58,714
- Yes, sir.
- I wanna tell you something.

678
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:01,309
And listen up,
'cause I really mean this.

679
00:43:01,386 --> 00:43:04,116
You're the luckiest man
in the world.

680
00:43:04,189 --> 00:43:08,489
There is nothing on this earth sexier-
believe me, gentlemen-

681
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,552
than a woman that
you have to salute in the morning.

682
00:43:12,231 --> 00:43:15,530
Promote 'em all, I say,
'cause this is true:

683
00:43:15,601 --> 00:43:18,729
If you haven't gotten a blowjob
from a superior officer...

684
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:23,264
well, you’re just letting
the best in life pass you by.

685
00:43:24,443 --> 00:43:27,105
Colonel, the practice of Code Reds
is still condoned by officers-

686
00:43:27,179 --> 00:43:31,616
My problem is that I'm a colonel,
so I'll go on taking cold showers...

687
00:43:31,683 --> 00:43:34,243
until they elect some gal president.

688
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,787
I need an answer to my question, sir.

689
00:43:36,855 --> 00:43:40,416
Take caution in your tone, Commander.

690
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:45,862
I'm a fair guy, but this fucking heat
is making me absolutely crazy.

691
00:43:47,633 --> 00:43:50,067
You wanna ask me about Code Reds?
On the record...

692
00:43:50,135 --> 00:43:52,126
I tell you I discourage
the practice...

693
00:43:52,204 --> 00:43:54,263
in accordance
with the commander's directive.

694
00:43:54,339 --> 00:43:57,365
Off the record,
I tell you it is an invaluable part...

695
00:43:57,442 --> 00:43:59,376
of close-infantry training.

696
00:43:59,444 --> 00:44:03,380
And if it happens to go on
without my knowledge, so be it.

697
00:44:03,448 --> 00:44:06,474
I run my unit how I run my unit.

698
00:44:06,552 --> 00:44:10,989
You wanna investigate me,
roll the dice and take your chances.

699
00:44:11,056 --> 00:44:15,550
I eat breakfast 300 yards from
4,000 Cubans who are trained to kill me.

700
00:44:15,627 --> 00:44:18,721
So don't think for one second that
you can come down here...

701
00:44:18,797 --> 00:44:20,890
flash a badge...

702
00:44:20,966 --> 00:44:23,560
and make me nervous.

703
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:28,968
Let's go.

704
00:44:31,977 --> 00:44:35,572
Colonel, I'll just need a copy
of Santiago’s transfer order.

705
00:44:36,181 --> 00:44:37,239
What's that?

706
00:44:37,316 --> 00:44:40,444
Santiago's transfer order. You guys
have paperwork on that kind of thing.

707
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:42,453
I just need it for the file.

708
00:44:42,521 --> 00:44:45,513
- For the file.
- Yeah.

709
00:44:47,659 --> 00:44:51,993
Of course you can have a copy
of the transfer order for the file.

710
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:55,329
- I'm here to help in anyway I can.
- Thank you.

711
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,427
You believe that, don’t you, Danny, that
I'm here to help you in anyway I can?

712
00:45:00,505 --> 00:45:01,767
Of course.

713
00:45:02,474 --> 00:45:05,966
Corporal will take you by personnel
on your way out to the flight line...

714
00:45:06,044 --> 00:45:10,276
and you can have
all the transfer orders that you want.

715
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:14,547
- Let's go.
- But you have to ask me nicely.

716
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:18,184
I beg your pardon?

717
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:21,385
You have to ask me nicely.

718
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:24,861
You see, Danny, I can deal with
the bullets and the bombs and the blood.

719
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:28,093
I don't want money,
and I don't want medals.

720
00:45:28,166 --> 00:45:32,865
What I do want is for you to stand there
in that faggoty white uniform...

721
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:37,375
and with your Harvard mouth
extend me some fucking courtesy.

722
00:45:40,078 --> 00:45:42,569
You gotta ask me nicely.

723
00:45:46,084 --> 00:45:48,416
Colonel Jessup,
if it’s not too much trouble...

724
00:45:48,487 --> 00:45:52,389
I'd like a copy
of the transfer order, sir.

725
00:45:55,727 --> 00:45:57,160
No problem.

726
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:25,587
In the seventh. San Diego leads.
Braves try to comeback.

727
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:27,921
Runners don’t go.

728
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:30,757
Hard drive, right field.
We're gonna have a tied ballgame.

729
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:34,788
It's on its way,
and it is now 10 to 10.

730
00:46:34,866 --> 00:46:36,800
And I don't believe it.

731
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:42,197
- Who is it?
- It's me.

732
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:49,140
I really missed you. I was just saying
to myself it’s been almost three hours.

733
00:46:49,214 --> 00:46:52,047
- Markinson's disappeared.
- What?

734
00:46:52,117 --> 00:46:54,881
Colonel Markinson's gone U.A.-
unauthorized absence.

735
00:46:54,953 --> 00:46:56,443
I know what it means.
When?

736
00:46:56,521 --> 00:46:58,785
This afternoon.
Sometime after we left.

737
00:46:59,524 --> 00:47:02,152
- I'll try to find him in the morning.
- I've already tried.

738
00:47:02,227 --> 00:47:03,956
You tried?

739
00:47:05,297 --> 00:47:08,630
Joanne, you're coming dangerously close
to the textbook definition...

740
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,998
of interfering
with a government investigation.

741
00:47:11,069 --> 00:47:12,661
I'm Louden Downey's attorney.

742
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:17,501
Aunt Ginny. She says she feels
like she's known me for years.

743
00:47:17,576 --> 00:47:19,840
So I suggested that she might feel
more comfortable...

744
00:47:19,911 --> 00:47:22,072
if I were directly involved
with the case.

745
00:47:22,147 --> 00:47:25,548
She had Louden sign the papers
about an hour ago.

746
00:47:25,617 --> 00:47:27,585
I suppose
it's way too much to hope...

747
00:47:27,652 --> 00:47:30,120
that you’re making this up
just to bother me.

748
00:47:30,188 --> 00:47:32,349
Don't worry. I'm not gonna
make a motion for separation.

749
00:47:32,424 --> 00:47:35,291
- You're still lead counsel.
- Splendid.

750
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:38,193
I think Kendrick ordered the Code Red,
and so do you.

751
00:47:40,098 --> 00:47:41,998
Let's go.

752
00:47:45,504 --> 00:47:47,631
Officer on deck!

753
00:47:47,706 --> 00:47:49,640
- Did Kendrick order the Code Red?
- Sir?

754
00:47:49,708 --> 00:47:53,371
Don't say "Sir" like I just asked you
if you cleaned the latrine.

755
00:47:53,445 --> 00:47:55,709
You heard what I said. Did
Lieutenant Kendrick order you guys...

756
00:47:55,781 --> 00:47:57,806
to give Santiago a Code Red?

757
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:00,214
Yes, sir.

758
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:03,983
- Did he?
- Yes, sir.

759
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,020
You mind telling me
why you never mentioned this before?

760
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:16,158
-You didn't ask.
-That won't win you a place in my heart.

761
00:48:16,234 --> 00:48:18,532
I get paid no matter
how much time you spend in jail.

762
00:48:18,603 --> 00:48:20,662
Yes, sir. I know you do, sir.

763
00:48:20,739 --> 00:48:22,900
- Fuck you, Harold!
- All right.

764
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:26,410
At ease.

765
00:48:26,478 --> 00:48:28,412
- Let's sort this thing out.
- Shit!

766
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,916
There was a platoon meeting
on September 6 at 4:00 in the afternoon.

767
00:48:31,983 --> 00:48:34,349
Lieutenant Kendrick says
that he gave strict instructions...

768
00:48:34,419 --> 00:48:36,512
that nothing was to happen
to Santiago.

769
00:48:36,588 --> 00:48:39,648
Now, is this true?

770
00:48:40,525 --> 00:48:42,356
I want you to speak freely.

771
00:48:45,263 --> 00:48:46,821
Ma'am, that's correct...

772
00:48:46,898 --> 00:48:49,560
but then he dismissed the platoon
and we all went to our rooms.

773
00:48:49,634 --> 00:48:50,999
And what happened then?

774
00:48:51,069 --> 00:48:53,697
Lieutenant Kendrick came
to our room, ma'am.

775
00:48:53,772 --> 00:48:54,830
When?

776
00:48:56,308 --> 00:49:00,540
About five minutes after the meeting
broke, sir. About 1620.

777
00:49:00,612 --> 00:49:02,239
And what happened then?

778
00:49:03,081 --> 00:49:07,575
Lieutenant Kendrick ordered us
to give Santiago a Code Red.

779
00:49:08,954 --> 00:49:10,046
Jack!

780
00:49:10,121 --> 00:49:12,351
Hang on.

781
00:49:12,424 --> 00:49:13,948
They were given an order.

782
00:49:16,862 --> 00:49:19,023
-Jack, come on.
- Be right back.

783
00:49:19,097 --> 00:49:22,294
- What are you doin', Jack?
- Be right back.

784
00:49:22,367 --> 00:49:25,530
- How long did you know about the order?
- I didn't. Who's this?

785
00:49:25,604 --> 00:49:29,267
That's Jo Galloway, Downey's lawyer.
She's very pleased to meet you.

786
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:32,504
- What exactly are you accusing me of?
- How long did you know about the order?

787
00:49:32,577 --> 00:49:34,602
He didn't, 'cause if he did
and hadn't told us...

788
00:49:34,679 --> 00:49:37,443
he'd be violating about 14 articles
of the Code of Ethics.

789
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:38,949
He has enough to worry about...

790
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:41,110
God forbid our clients
decide to plead not guilty...

791
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:43,416
and testify for the record
that they were given an order.

792
00:49:43,488 --> 00:49:46,116
Kendrick specifically told those men
not to touch Santiago.

793
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:48,056
That's right. And then he went
into Dawson and Downey's room...

794
00:49:48,126 --> 00:49:50,117
and specifically told them
to give him a Code Red.

795
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:52,925
- Kendrick said different. Have proof?
- He's lying. I have the defendants.

796
00:49:52,998 --> 00:49:55,125
And I have 23 Marines
who aren't accused of murder...

797
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,498
and a lieutenant
with four letters of commendation.

798
00:49:57,569 --> 00:49:59,764
- Why did Markinson go U.A.?
- We'll never know.

799
00:49:59,838 --> 00:50:02,830
- You don't think I could subpoena him?
- You can try, but you won't find him.

800
00:50:02,908 --> 00:50:06,776
You know what he did for the first 17
of his 26 years in the Corps?

801
00:50:06,845 --> 00:50:11,305
Counterintelligence. Markinson's gone.
There is no Markinson.

802
00:50:12,817 --> 00:50:14,751
Look, Danny.

803
00:50:14,819 --> 00:50:17,344
Jessup's star is on the rise.

804
00:50:17,422 --> 00:50:19,356
Division will give me
a lot of room on this one...

805
00:50:19,424 --> 00:50:21,619
to spare Jessup
and the Corps any embarrassment.

806
00:50:21,693 --> 00:50:22,853
How much?

807
00:50:24,029 --> 00:50:27,590
Involuntary manslaughter,
two years, they're home in six months.

808
00:50:27,666 --> 00:50:29,133
No deal. We're going to court.

809
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,031
- No, you're not.
- Why not?

810
00:50:31,102 --> 00:50:34,401
'Cause you’ll lose,
and Danny knows it.

811
00:50:34,472 --> 00:50:37,202
If we do go to court,
I'm gonna have to go all the way.

812
00:50:37,275 --> 00:50:39,607
They're gonna be charged
with a whole truckload-

813
00:50:39,678 --> 00:50:42,272
murder, conspiracy,
conduct unbecoming.

814
00:50:42,347 --> 00:50:44,747
Even though he's got me by the balls
out here, Danny knows...

815
00:50:44,816 --> 00:50:47,148
that in a courtroom,
he loses this case.

816
00:50:47,218 --> 00:50:49,152
Danny is an awfully talented lawyer.

817
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:51,620
He's not about to see
his clients go to jail for life...

818
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:54,181
when he knows
they can be home in six months.

819
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:56,860
That's the end of this negotiation.

820
00:50:57,762 --> 00:51:00,128
I'll see you tomorrow morning
at the arraignment.

821
00:51:03,535 --> 00:51:06,436
All right. Here's the story.

822
00:51:06,504 --> 00:51:11,203
The government's offering
involuntary manslaughter, two years.

823
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:13,210
Be home in six months.

824
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:19,475
Wow, Kaffee!
You're the greatest lawyer in the world!

825
00:51:19,551 --> 00:51:22,611
Ooh, how can we ever thank you?

826
00:51:22,687 --> 00:51:25,247
Fellas, you hear what I just said?

827
00:51:25,323 --> 00:51:28,588
You're going home in six months.

828
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:30,992
I'm afraid we can't do that, sir.

829
00:51:31,062 --> 00:51:34,395
- Do what?
- Make a deal, sir.

830
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:35,933
What are you talking about?

831
00:51:36,001 --> 00:51:38,834
We did nothing wrong, sir.
We did our job...

832
00:51:38,903 --> 00:51:42,066
and if that has consequences,
then I'll accept them.

833
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,540
But I won't say that I'm guilty, sir.

834
00:51:45,877 --> 00:51:49,438
Did you-
Did she put you up to this?

835
00:51:49,514 --> 00:51:53,006
- We have a code, sir.
- Oh, well, zip-a-dee-doo-dah!

836
00:51:53,084 --> 00:51:56,417
You and your code plead not guilty.
You'll be in jail the rest of your life.

837
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:59,548
Do what I'm telling you,
you'll be home in six months.

838
00:52:01,393 --> 00:52:03,361
Do it, Harold.
Six months.

839
00:52:03,428 --> 00:52:05,953
It's nothing.
It's a hockey season.

840
00:52:08,433 --> 00:52:10,128
- Permission to-
- Speak!

841
00:52:10,201 --> 00:52:12,294
Jesus!

842
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:17,699
- What do we do then, sir?
- When?

843
00:52:17,776 --> 00:52:20,802
After six months, we'll be
dishonorably discharged, right, sir?

844
00:52:20,879 --> 00:52:22,210
Probably.

845
00:52:23,448 --> 00:52:25,439
Well, what do we do then, sir?

846
00:52:28,153 --> 00:52:32,055
We joined the Marines because we wanted
to live our lives by a certain code.

847
00:52:32,123 --> 00:52:33,886
And we found it in the Corps.

848
00:52:33,958 --> 00:52:37,189
Now you’re asking us to sign a piece
of paper that says we have no honor.

849
00:52:37,262 --> 00:52:39,457
You're asking us
to say we’re not Marines.

850
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:41,829
If a court decides
that what we did was wrong...

851
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,925
then I'll accept
whatever punishment they give.

852
00:52:44,002 --> 00:52:47,460
But I believe I was right, sir.
I believe I did my job...

853
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:50,872
and I will not dishonor myself,
my unit or the Corps...

854
00:52:50,942 --> 00:52:55,003
so that I can go home
in six months...

855
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,513
sir.

856
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:08,523
Commander, I'd like to talk to Lance
Corporal Dawson alone for a minute.

857
00:53:10,095 --> 00:53:11,960
Sergeant.

858
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:14,555
We're gonna go to another room.

859
00:53:14,632 --> 00:53:16,964
- We'd like another holding room.
- All right, ma'am.

860
00:53:17,035 --> 00:53:19,469
- It's gonna be okay.
- Sit down.

861
00:53:30,915 --> 00:53:32,940
You don't like me very much, do you?

862
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:37,449
Forget it. Don't answer that.
It doesn't matter.

863
00:53:43,661 --> 00:53:45,094
You know...

864
00:53:46,464 --> 00:53:48,398
Downey worships you.

865
00:53:51,136 --> 00:53:53,627
He's gonna do whatever you do.

866
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:59,407
Are you really gonna let this happen
to him because of a code, Harold?

867
00:53:59,477 --> 00:54:01,911
- Do you think we were right?
- It doesn't matter-

868
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:06,041
- Do you think we were right?
- I think you’d lose.

869
00:54:08,019 --> 00:54:09,953
You're such a coward.

870
00:54:10,021 --> 00:54:12,581
I can't believe
they let you wear a uniform.

871
00:54:14,959 --> 00:54:17,587
I'm not gonna feel responsible for this.
I did everything I could.

872
00:54:17,662 --> 00:54:20,187
You're going to Leavenworth
for the better part of your life.

873
00:54:20,265 --> 00:54:22,199
And you know what?
I don't give a shit.

874
00:54:24,269 --> 00:54:27,238
What happened to saluting an officer
when he leaves the room?

875
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:37,406
Open it up.

876
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:42,948
I don't believe it.

877
00:54:43,019 --> 00:54:45,419
Dawson's gonna go to jail
just to spite me.

878
00:54:45,488 --> 00:54:48,048
Fine. If he wants to jump
off a cliff, that's his business.

879
00:54:48,124 --> 00:54:51,890
I'm not gonna hold his hand on the way.
I wanna get him a new lawyer. How?

880
00:54:51,961 --> 00:54:54,395
Just make a motion tomorrow morning
at the arraignment.

881
00:54:54,464 --> 00:54:56,455
The judge will ask you
if you want to enter a plea...

882
00:54:56,533 --> 00:54:58,933
and you tell him that you want
to have new counsel assigned.

883
00:55:00,470 --> 00:55:01,903
That's that.

884
00:55:01,971 --> 00:55:05,270
One thing, though. When you ask
the judge for new counsel...

885
00:55:05,342 --> 00:55:07,276
Danny, be sure and ask nicely.

886
00:55:08,178 --> 00:55:10,976
- What do you want from me?
- I want you to let them be judged.

887
00:55:11,047 --> 00:55:13,948
I want you to stand up
and make an argument.

888
00:55:14,017 --> 00:55:16,679
An argument that didn't work
for Calley at My Lai.

889
00:55:16,753 --> 00:55:18,880
An argument that didn't work
for the Nazis at Nuremburg.

890
00:55:18,955 --> 00:55:20,889
Oh, for Christ's sake, Sam.

891
00:55:20,957 --> 00:55:23,391
Do you really think that's the same
as two teenage Marines...

892
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:26,258
executing a routine order they never
believed would result in harm?

893
00:55:26,329 --> 00:55:28,024
These guys aren't the Nazis.

894
00:55:28,098 --> 00:55:31,158
Don't look now, Danny,
but you’re making an argument.

895
00:55:32,769 --> 00:55:36,296
Yeah, yeah. Tomorrow morning
I get them a new attorney.

896
00:55:36,373 --> 00:55:38,341
Why are you so afraid
to be a lawyer?

897
00:55:38,408 --> 00:55:40,876
Were Daddy's expectations
really that high?

898
00:55:40,944 --> 00:55:44,539
Oh, please. Spare me
the psycho-babble father bullshit!

899
00:55:44,614 --> 00:55:48,015
Dawson and Downey will have their day
in court, but with another lawyer.

900
00:55:48,084 --> 00:55:51,053
Another lawyer won’t be good enough.
They need you.

901
00:55:51,121 --> 00:55:54,682
You know how to win. You know they have
a case, and you know how to win.

902
00:55:54,758 --> 00:55:57,192
If you walk away from this now,
you've sealed their fate.

903
00:55:57,260 --> 00:56:00,627
Their fate was sealed
the moment Santiago died.

904
00:56:00,697 --> 00:56:03,325
- Do you believe they have a case?
- You and Dawson.

905
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,459
You both live
in the same dream world.

906
00:56:05,535 --> 00:56:07,469
It doesn't matter what I believe.

907
00:56:07,537 --> 00:56:09,664
It only matters what I can prove.

908
00:56:09,739 --> 00:56:12,674
So, please, don't tell me
what I know and don't know!

909
00:56:12,742 --> 00:56:14,505
I know the law!

910
00:56:19,482 --> 00:56:21,416
You know nothing about the law.

911
00:56:21,484 --> 00:56:23,679
You're a used car salesman, Daniel.

912
00:56:23,753 --> 00:56:26,244
You're an ambulance chaser
with a rank.

913
00:56:26,322 --> 00:56:29,416
You're nothing. Live with that.

914
00:56:35,965 --> 00:56:37,899
So I told Duncan...

915
00:56:37,967 --> 00:56:42,131
"If you wanna take this to court
I'm gonna file nine discovery motions...

916
00:56:42,205 --> 00:56:45,504
and you're gonna spend a year
going blind on paperwork...

917
00:56:45,575 --> 00:56:49,067
because a 90-year-old man
misread the Delaware insurance code. "

918
00:56:49,145 --> 00:56:51,340
- So what happened?
- He calls back 15 minutes later.

919
00:56:51,414 --> 00:56:53,348
He says, " Let's make a deal. "

920
00:57:40,530 --> 00:57:41,963
All rise.

921
00:57:49,472 --> 00:57:50,564
Where are we?

922
00:57:52,242 --> 00:57:55,803
Docket number 411275VR-5.

923
00:57:55,879 --> 00:57:58,905
The United States v.
Lance Corporal Harold W. Dawson...

924
00:57:58,982 --> 00:58:01,007
and Private First Class Louden Downey.

925
00:58:01,084 --> 00:58:04,212
The accused are charged with murder,
conspiracy to commit murder...

926
00:58:04,287 --> 00:58:06,847
and conduct unbecoming
a United States Marine.

927
00:58:06,923 --> 00:58:09,118
Does the defense wish to enter a plea?

928
00:58:10,894 --> 00:58:12,327
Yeah.

929
00:58:16,032 --> 00:58:17,431
They're not guilty.

930
00:58:20,603 --> 00:58:23,197
Enter a plea of not guilty
for the accused.

931
00:58:23,273 --> 00:58:26,538
We'll adjourn until 1000,
three weeks from today...

932
00:58:26,609 --> 00:58:29,544
at which time this general
court-martial will reconvene.

933
00:58:46,129 --> 00:58:49,587
Why does a lieutenant junior grade
with ninth months' experience...

934
00:58:49,666 --> 00:58:53,033
and a track record for plea bargaining
get assigned a murder case?

935
00:58:55,872 --> 00:58:58,864
Would it be so that it never sees
the inside of a courtroom?

936
00:59:01,477 --> 00:59:03,411
We'll work out of my apartment
every night, 7:00.

937
00:59:03,479 --> 00:59:08,109
Jo, pick up a carton of legal pads, half
a dozen boxes of red and black pens.

938
00:59:08,184 --> 00:59:11,415
Sam, get a couple of desk lamps.
I need a preliminary medical profile.

939
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:15,924
Jo, we need all proficiency and conduct
reports on Dawson, Downey and Santiago.

940
00:59:15,992 --> 00:59:18,187
The only thing I have to eat
is Yoo-hoo and Cocoa Puffs...

941
00:59:18,261 --> 00:59:20,195
so if you want anything else,
bring it with you.

942
00:59:20,263 --> 00:59:22,424
- Okay?
- Yeah.

943
00:59:28,504 --> 00:59:30,904
So this is what
a courtroom looks like.

944
00:59:41,384 --> 00:59:43,909
Were you able to speak
to your friend at the N.I.S.?

945
00:59:44,988 --> 00:59:48,253
Yeah. She said if Markinson
doesn't want to be found...

946
00:59:48,324 --> 00:59:50,224
we're not gonna find him.

947
00:59:50,293 --> 00:59:53,228
She said I could be Markinson,
and you wouldn't know it.

948
00:59:54,797 --> 00:59:56,356
Are you Markinson?

949
00:59:57,257 --> 00:59:58,357
No.

950
00:59:59,135 --> 01:00:01,035
I'm not Markinson.

951
01:00:02,138 --> 01:00:04,299
That's two down.

952
01:00:06,109 --> 01:00:07,303
What?

953
01:00:09,479 --> 01:00:12,778
I'm just wondering,
now that Joanne’s on this-

954
01:00:12,849 --> 01:00:15,374
I'm just wondering
if you still need me.

955
01:00:15,451 --> 01:00:18,249
- They were following orders.
- An illegal order.

956
01:00:18,321 --> 01:00:20,551
Do you think they knew
it was an illegal order?

957
01:00:20,623 --> 01:00:23,956
It doesn't matter what they knew.
Any decent human being would have refused-

958
01:00:24,027 --> 01:00:26,291
They're not permitted
to question orders.

959
01:00:26,362 --> 01:00:29,388
Then what's the secret? Huh?
What are the magic words?

960
01:00:29,465 --> 01:00:31,057
I give orders every day-

961
01:00:31,134 --> 01:00:33,068
We have softball games
and marching bands.

962
01:00:33,136 --> 01:00:37,334
They work at a place where you have to
wear camouflage or you might get shot!

963
01:00:45,081 --> 01:00:47,140
I need you.

964
01:00:47,216 --> 01:00:52,153
You're better at research than I am,
and you know how to prepare a witness.

965
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:00,688
I've got medical reports
and Chinese food. I say we eat first.

966
01:01:08,204 --> 01:01:09,262
What?

967
01:01:11,474 --> 01:01:13,408
You got any kung pao chicken?

968
01:01:16,779 --> 01:01:20,306
This is our defense- intent. No one
can prove there was poison on the rag.

969
01:01:20,383 --> 01:01:23,250
Code Red- they're common
and accepted in Guantanamo Bay.

970
01:01:23,319 --> 01:01:27,688
The order- A: Kendrick gave it,
B: They had to follow it.

971
01:01:27,757 --> 01:01:29,884
- That's it.
- What about motive?

972
01:01:29,959 --> 01:01:31,984
We're a little weak on motive.
They had one.

973
01:01:32,061 --> 01:01:34,222
- Just because a person has a motive
doesn't mean they're guilty. - Relax.

974
01:01:34,297 --> 01:01:36,663
We'll deal with the fence line shooting
when it comes up.

975
01:01:36,733 --> 01:01:39,896
Let's start with intent. I don't
want to know what made Santiago die.

976
01:01:39,969 --> 01:01:42,904
I just want to show it could've been
something other than poison.

977
01:01:42,972 --> 01:01:46,533
Jo, talk to doctors. Find out everything
there is to know about lactic acidosis.

978
01:01:46,609 --> 01:01:49,908
This is Lieutenant Commander Galloway
with the JAG Corps in Washington.

979
01:01:49,979 --> 01:01:53,210
I've been trying to track down
a Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Markinson.

980
01:01:53,282 --> 01:01:56,115
Doctor, was there any sign
of external damage?

981
01:01:56,185 --> 01:02:00,679
No scrapes? No cuts?
Bruises? Broken bones?

982
01:02:00,757 --> 01:02:05,126
- Was there any sign of violence?
- You mean, other than the dead body?

983
01:02:05,194 --> 01:02:07,958
Shit, I walk into that
every goddamn time.

984
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:12,660
He ordered me and Lance Corporal Dawson
to give Willie a Code Red.

985
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:14,965
Answers still have to come
much faster.

986
01:02:15,037 --> 01:02:17,130
This Iowa farm boy thing
will play for a while...

987
01:02:17,206 --> 01:02:19,606
but in the end, it sounds
like he's searching for the truth.

988
01:02:19,675 --> 01:02:21,939
He's right. From now on,
Willie is Private Santiago.

989
01:02:22,011 --> 01:02:24,343
You start calling him Willie,
and all of a sudden he's a person...

990
01:02:24,413 --> 01:02:26,643
who's got a mother
who's gonna miss him, okay?

991
01:02:26,716 --> 01:02:28,650
They drew the court members
this afternoon.

992
01:02:28,718 --> 01:02:31,016
Seven men, two women,
five Navy, four Marines.

993
01:02:31,087 --> 01:02:33,612
All officers with line experience.
Neither of the women have children.

994
01:02:33,689 --> 01:02:35,987
That's a bad break.
There’s nothing we can do.

995
01:02:36,058 --> 01:02:38,822
My father always said a jury trial
is not just about the law.

996
01:02:38,895 --> 01:02:42,058
It's about assigning blame.
Santiago's dead, and he shouldn't be.

997
01:02:42,131 --> 01:02:44,998
These nine people are gonna insist
that someone be blamed for that.

998
01:02:45,067 --> 01:02:47,535
Ross is handing them our clients.
We're gonna hand them Kendrick.

999
01:02:47,603 --> 01:02:51,130
This is about a sales pitch. It's not going to be won
by the law. It's gonna be won by the lawyers.

1000
01:02:51,207 --> 01:02:54,506
So remember, poker faces. Don’t flinch
in front of the court members.

1001
01:02:54,577 --> 01:02:58,343
Something doesn't go our way, don't hang
your head or shift in your seat.

1002
01:02:58,414 --> 01:03:02,145
Whatever happens, you have to look like
it's exactly what you knew would happen.

1003
01:03:02,218 --> 01:03:06,814
- If you pass me documents-
- Do it swiftly and don't look eager.

1004
01:03:06,889 --> 01:03:10,154
Don't wear that perfume in court.
Wrecks my concentration.

1005
01:03:10,226 --> 01:03:11,659
Really?

1006
01:03:11,727 --> 01:03:14,059
I was talking to Sam.

1007
01:03:15,431 --> 01:03:16,830
What time is it?

1008
01:03:16,899 --> 01:03:18,890
It's time to go home.
Try to get some sleep tonight.

1009
01:03:18,968 --> 01:03:20,993
- Yeah.
- Give me a ride?

1010
01:03:21,070 --> 01:03:22,503
Sure.

1011
01:03:25,474 --> 01:03:27,635
You're a good man, Charlie Brown.

1012
01:03:27,710 --> 01:03:30,201
I'll see you in court, counselor.

1013
01:03:36,953 --> 01:03:39,148
- Danny, I-
- You don't have to say it.

1014
01:03:39,222 --> 01:03:41,622
We've had our differences.
I said some things I didn't mean.

1015
01:03:41,691 --> 01:03:45,058
You said some things you didn't mean,
but you’re happy I stuck with the case.

1016
01:03:45,127 --> 01:03:49,530
And if you’ve gained a certain respect
for me over the last three weeks...

1017
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:51,658
of course, I'm happy about that.

1018
01:03:51,734 --> 01:03:53,827
But we don't have to make
a whole big deal out of it.

1019
01:03:53,903 --> 01:03:56,167
If you like me,
I won't make you say it.

1020
01:03:56,239 --> 01:03:59,675
I was just gonna tell you
to wear matching socks tomorrow.

1021
01:04:01,544 --> 01:04:04,877
Okay. Good tip.

1022
01:04:05,715 --> 01:04:06,977
We're ready.

1023
01:04:07,049 --> 01:04:09,483
Better believe it.

1024
01:04:19,395 --> 01:04:21,329
We're gonna get creamed.

1025
01:04:50,793 --> 01:04:52,920
- Lieutenant Kaffee?
- Yes?

1026
01:04:52,995 --> 01:04:55,361
You are gonna save our son,
aren’t you?

1027
01:04:56,432 --> 01:04:57,763
I'll do my best.

1028
01:04:58,534 --> 01:05:03,198
Danny, I'd like you to meet
Ginny Miller, Louden's aunt.

1029
01:05:04,206 --> 01:05:07,175
- You're Aunt Ginny?
- Uh-huh.

1030
01:05:08,377 --> 01:05:11,540
I'm sorry. I was expecting
someone older.

1031
01:05:11,614 --> 01:05:13,343
So was I.

1032
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:19,445
Last chance.
I'll flip you for it.

1033
01:05:19,522 --> 01:05:21,956
- All rise.
- Too late.

1034
01:05:30,466 --> 01:05:33,629
All those having business
with this general court-martial...

1035
01:05:33,703 --> 01:05:36,263
stand forward
and you shall be heard.

1036
01:05:36,339 --> 01:05:39,797
Colonel Julius Alexander Randolph
is presiding.

1037
01:05:39,875 --> 01:05:42,435
Is the government prepared
to make an opening statement?

1038
01:05:42,511 --> 01:05:43,944
Yes, sir.

1039
01:05:47,249 --> 01:05:49,308
The facts of the case are these:

1040
01:05:49,385 --> 01:05:52,183
On midnight of September 6,
the accused entered the barracks room...

1041
01:05:52,254 --> 01:05:55,223
of their platoon mate,
P.F.C. William Santiago.

1042
01:05:55,291 --> 01:05:58,385
They woke him up,
tied his arms and legs with tape...

1043
01:05:58,461 --> 01:06:00,725
and forced a rag into his throat.

1044
01:06:00,796 --> 01:06:04,391
A few minutes later, a chemical reaction
called lactic acidosis...

1045
01:06:04,467 --> 01:06:06,594
caused his lungs to begin bleeding.

1046
01:06:06,669 --> 01:06:08,603
He drowned in his own blood...

1047
01:06:08,671 --> 01:06:12,300
and was pronounced dead
at 37 minutes past midnight.

1048
01:06:12,375 --> 01:06:17,403
These are the facts of the case,
and they are undisputed.

1049
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:21,109
That's right.
The story I’ve just told you...

1050
01:06:21,183 --> 01:06:24,744
is the exact same story you’re gonna
hear from Lance Corporal Dawson...

1051
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:27,550
and it's the exact same story
you're gonna hear from Private Downey.

1052
01:06:27,623 --> 01:06:30,319
Furthermore, the government
will also demonstrate...

1053
01:06:30,393 --> 01:06:32,827
that the accused
soaked the rag in poison...

1054
01:06:32,895 --> 01:06:36,991
and entered Santiago's room
with motive and intent to kill.

1055
01:06:38,401 --> 01:06:40,426
Now, Lieutenant Kaffee...

1056
01:06:40,503 --> 01:06:43,597
is gonna try and pull off
a little magic act here.

1057
01:06:43,672 --> 01:06:46,163
He's gonna try a little misdirection.

1058
01:06:46,242 --> 01:06:49,973
He's gonna astonish you
with stories of rituals...

1059
01:06:50,046 --> 01:06:52,947
and dazzle you
with official-sounding terms...

1060
01:06:53,015 --> 01:06:54,949
like "Code Red. "

1061
01:06:56,118 --> 01:06:59,349
He might even try to cut into
a few officers for you.

1062
01:06:59,422 --> 01:07:04,291
He'll have no evidence, mind you, none,
but it's gonna be entertaining.

1063
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:07,852
And when we get to the end,
all the magic in the world...

1064
01:07:07,930 --> 01:07:10,626
will not have been able to divert
your attention from the fact...

1065
01:07:10,699 --> 01:07:16,194
that Willie Santiago is dead
and Dawson and Downey killed him.

1066
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:21,232
These are the facts of the case,
and they are undisputed.

1067
01:07:23,045 --> 01:07:24,637
Lieutenant Kaffee.

1068
01:07:24,713 --> 01:07:27,614
There was no poison on the rag,
and there was no intent to kill.

1069
01:07:27,683 --> 01:07:32,416
Any attempt to prove otherwise is futile
'cause it just ain't true.

1070
01:07:32,488 --> 01:07:35,719
When Dawson and Downey went
into Santiago's room that night...

1071
01:07:35,791 --> 01:07:38,385
it wasn't because of vengeance
or hatred.

1072
01:07:38,461 --> 01:07:42,158
It wasn't to kill or harm, and it wasn't
because they were looking for kicks.

1073
01:07:42,231 --> 01:07:44,961
It's because it was
what they were ordered to do.

1074
01:07:46,368 --> 01:07:47,801
Let me say that again.

1075
01:07:47,870 --> 01:07:50,930
It's because it was
what they were ordered to do.

1076
01:07:51,907 --> 01:07:53,602
Out in the real world
that means nothing...

1077
01:07:53,676 --> 01:07:57,840
and here at the Washington Navy Yard
it doesn't mean a whole lot more.

1078
01:07:57,913 --> 01:08:01,872
But if you’re a Marine assigned
to Rifle Security Company Windward...

1079
01:08:01,951 --> 01:08:04,886
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,
and you're given an order...

1080
01:08:04,954 --> 01:08:07,548
you follow it
or you pack your bags.

1081
01:08:07,623 --> 01:08:09,614
Make no mistake about it.

1082
01:08:09,692 --> 01:08:12,957
Harold Dawson and Louden Downey
are sitting before you today...

1083
01:08:13,028 --> 01:08:16,395
because they did their job.

1084
01:08:19,902 --> 01:08:22,200
Is the government ready
to call its first witness?

1085
01:08:23,339 --> 01:08:26,934
If it please the court,
the government calls Mr. R.C. McGuire.

1086
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:33,575
Mr. McGuire, would you
raise your right hand, please?

1087
01:08:33,649 --> 01:08:36,413
Do you solemnly swear that the testimony
you give this general court-martial...

1088
01:08:36,485 --> 01:08:39,420
will be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

1089
01:08:39,488 --> 01:08:42,821
- I do.
- Have a seat, please, sir.

1090
01:08:42,892 --> 01:08:46,259
Would you state your full name
and occupation, for the record?

1091
01:08:46,328 --> 01:08:50,765
Robert C. McGuire, Special Agent,
Naval Investigative Service.

1092
01:08:50,833 --> 01:08:55,133
Mr. McGuire, did your office receive
a letter from P.F.C. William Santiago...

1093
01:08:55,204 --> 01:08:57,331
on 3 September of this year?

1094
01:08:57,406 --> 01:08:59,704
- We did.
- What did that letter say?

1095
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:04,439
That a member of Santiago’s unit had
illegally fired his weapon over the fence line.

1096
01:09:04,513 --> 01:09:06,640
Was that Marine
identified in the letter?

1097
01:09:06,715 --> 01:09:10,242
No. I notified the barracks C.O.
Colonel Jessup...

1098
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:12,344
that I would be coming down
to investigate.

1099
01:09:12,421 --> 01:09:14,150
And what did you find?

1100
01:09:14,223 --> 01:09:17,283
The shift reported only one sentry
returned his weapon to the switch...

1101
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:19,350
with a round of ammunition missing.

1102
01:09:19,428 --> 01:09:22,659
- Who was that?
- Lance Corporal Harold Dawson.

1103
01:09:22,731 --> 01:09:24,323
Your witness.

1104
01:09:27,002 --> 01:09:30,233
Mr. McGuire, have you questioned Dawson
about the fence line shooting?

1105
01:09:30,306 --> 01:09:34,265
Yes. He claims to have been engaged
in some manner by the enemy.

1106
01:09:34,343 --> 01:09:36,538
- You don' believe him?
- It's not my place-

1107
01:09:36,612 --> 01:09:38,842
Lance Corporal Dawson's been charged
with a number of crimes.

1108
01:09:38,914 --> 01:09:41,576
Why wasn’t he charged with firing
at the enemy without cause?

1109
01:09:43,352 --> 01:09:46,253
There wasn't enough evidence
to support such a charge.

1110
01:09:46,322 --> 01:09:48,256
Thank you.

1111
01:09:49,325 --> 01:09:51,452
Mr. McGuire, I don't understand
what you mean when you say...

1112
01:09:51,527 --> 01:09:54,121
"There wasn't enough evidence
to support such a charge. "

1113
01:09:54,196 --> 01:09:56,494
You had William Santiago's letter.

1114
01:09:57,766 --> 01:09:59,700
Santiago was the only eyewitness.

1115
01:09:59,768 --> 01:10:03,204
I never had the chance to interview him,
so I don't know what he saw.

1116
01:10:03,272 --> 01:10:06,332
And now we'll never know,
will we, Mr. McGuire?

1117
01:10:10,045 --> 01:10:12,980
- No more questions.
- The witness is excused.

1118
01:10:17,019 --> 01:10:19,715
Corporal Carl Edward Hammaker,
Marine Barracks...

1119
01:10:19,788 --> 01:10:23,053
Rifle Security Company Windward,
Second Platoon Bravo.

1120
01:10:23,125 --> 01:10:26,561
Corporal, were you present at a meeting
that Lieutenant Kendrick held...

1121
01:10:26,629 --> 01:10:29,996
on the afternoon of September 6
with the members of the Second Platoon?

1122
01:10:30,065 --> 01:10:31,362
Yes, sir.

1123
01:10:31,433 --> 01:10:34,027
Would you tell the court
the substance of that meeting?

1124
01:10:34,103 --> 01:10:37,266
Lieutenant Kendrick told us
we had an informer in our group-

1125
01:10:37,339 --> 01:10:40,035
that Private Santiago had gone
outside the chain of command...

1126
01:10:40,109 --> 01:10:43,044
and reported to the N.I.S.
on a member of our platoon.

1127
01:10:43,112 --> 01:10:47,014
Did that make you mad?
You can tell the truth, Corporal.

1128
01:10:47,082 --> 01:10:48,913
- Did it make you mad?
- Yes, sir.

1129
01:10:48,984 --> 01:10:50,212
How mad?

1130
01:10:50,286 --> 01:10:54,120
Private Santiago betrayed a code
we believe in very deeply, sir.

1131
01:10:54,189 --> 01:10:57,181
- Were the other squad members angry?
- Object. Speculation.

1132
01:10:57,259 --> 01:10:59,454
- Were Dawson and Downey?
- Is the government counsel...

1133
01:10:59,528 --> 01:11:04,090
honestly asking the witness to testify
as to how my clients felt?

1134
01:11:04,166 --> 01:11:06,100
Sustained.

1135
01:11:07,936 --> 01:11:11,895
Corporal, did Lieutenant Kendrick
leave a standing order at that meeting?

1136
01:11:11,974 --> 01:11:14,067
- Yes, sir.
- What was it?

1137
01:11:15,844 --> 01:11:19,871
Well, it was clear that he didn't want
us taking matters into our own hands.

1138
01:11:19,948 --> 01:11:21,939
What was the order?

1139
01:11:23,819 --> 01:11:26,788
Sir, he said Santiago
wasn't to be touched.

1140
01:11:28,357 --> 01:11:29,949
Your witness.

1141
01:11:31,026 --> 01:11:33,017
Corporal Hammaker, were you
in Dawson and Downey's barracks...

1142
01:11:33,095 --> 01:11:34,926
five minutes after this meeting?

1143
01:11:34,997 --> 01:11:36,555
No, sir.

1144
01:11:36,632 --> 01:11:39,294
Thanks.
I have no more questions.

1145
01:11:39,368 --> 01:11:41,427
The witness is excused.

1146
01:11:45,274 --> 01:11:47,572
The government calls
Corporal Raymond Thomas.

1147
01:11:47,643 --> 01:11:50,874
I understand Captain Ross is planning
on calling all the other members...

1148
01:11:50,946 --> 01:11:53,574
of Rifle Security Company Windward
to testify.

1149
01:11:53,649 --> 01:11:55,844
In light of the defense Lieutenant
Kaffee is planning to mount...

1150
01:11:55,918 --> 01:11:59,854
the explicit instructions of a platoon
leader seems particularly relevant.

1151
01:11:59,922 --> 01:12:02,447
The defense is willing to concede
that all 22 witnesses...

1152
01:12:02,524 --> 01:12:04,822
will testify substantially
as Corporal Hammaker did...

1153
01:12:04,893 --> 01:12:07,259
if the government is willing to concede
that none of them...

1154
01:12:07,329 --> 01:12:10,958
were in Dawson and Downey's room
at 16:20 on September 6.

1155
01:12:11,033 --> 01:12:12,967
Captain?

1156
01:12:13,035 --> 01:12:15,503
The government will stipulate.

1157
01:12:15,571 --> 01:12:19,530
Then we'll adjourn for the day.
You can call your next witness tomorrow.

1158
01:12:19,608 --> 01:12:21,542
All rise.

1159
01:12:33,021 --> 01:12:34,955
I want to go over the doctor again.

1160
01:12:35,023 --> 01:12:37,890
- We're taking the right approach.
- We've been over this already.

1161
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:41,555
Listen to me. 3:00- Stone says
he doesn't know what killed Santiago.

1162
01:12:41,630 --> 01:12:45,327
Then he meets with Jessup,
and at 5:00 he says it was poison?

1163
01:12:45,401 --> 01:12:48,131
- The doctor's not telling the truth.
- Oh, that's a relief!.

1164
01:12:48,203 --> 01:12:51,297
I was afraid I wouldn't be able to use
the "liar, liar, pants on fire" defense.

1165
01:12:51,373 --> 01:12:56,208
We can't prove coercion.
Let's go over what we have, okay?

1166
01:13:06,555 --> 01:13:10,218
Private Santiago was admitted
to the E.R. at 0012...

1167
01:13:10,292 --> 01:13:13,819
and he was pronounced dead
at 0037.

1168
01:13:13,896 --> 01:13:17,093
Dr. Stone, what is lactic acidosis?

1169
01:13:17,166 --> 01:13:20,294
If the muscles and other cells
of the body burn sugar...

1170
01:13:20,369 --> 01:13:23,236
instead of oxygen,
lactic acid is produced.

1171
01:13:23,305 --> 01:13:26,741
That lactic acid is what caused
Santiago's lungs to bleed.

1172
01:13:26,809 --> 01:13:29,744
Normally, how long does it take
for the muscles and other cells...

1173
01:13:29,812 --> 01:13:32,246
to begin burning sugar
instead of oxygen?

1174
01:13:32,314 --> 01:13:34,874
Twenty to thirty minutes.

1175
01:13:34,950 --> 01:13:38,681
And what caused this process
to be sped up in Santiago's muscles?

1176
01:13:38,754 --> 01:13:40,915
An ingested poison of some kind.

1177
01:13:40,989 --> 01:13:44,049
Your Honor, we object at this point.
The witness is speculating.

1178
01:13:44,126 --> 01:13:46,185
Commander Stone is an expert
medical witness.

1179
01:13:46,261 --> 01:13:48,729
In this courtroom, his opinion
is not considered speculation.

1180
01:13:48,797 --> 01:13:51,789
Commander Stone is an internist,
not a criminologist.

1181
01:13:51,867 --> 01:13:54,427
The medical facts here
are ultimately inconclusive.

1182
01:13:54,503 --> 01:13:58,200
A point I'm confident you’ll illustrate
to the court under cross-examination.

1183
01:13:58,273 --> 01:14:01,436
So I'm sure you won't mind
if his opinion is admitted now.

1184
01:14:01,510 --> 01:14:03,273
Not at all, sir.

1185
01:14:05,781 --> 01:14:09,945
Dr. Stone, did Willie Santiago
die of poisoning?

1186
01:14:10,018 --> 01:14:11,713
Absolutely.

1187
01:14:11,787 --> 01:14:15,883
You're aware that the lab and coroner's
report show no traces of poison?

1188
01:14:15,958 --> 01:14:18,483
- Yes, I am.
- Then how do you justify-

1189
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:21,529
There are literally dozens of toxins
which are virtually undetectable...

1190
01:14:21,597 --> 01:14:24,259
both in the human body
and on a fabric.

1191
01:14:24,333 --> 01:14:27,996
The nature of the acidosis
is the compelling factor on this issue.

1192
01:14:28,871 --> 01:14:30,771
Thank you, sir.

1193
01:14:32,708 --> 01:14:36,041
Commander, is it possible for a person
to have an affliction-

1194
01:14:36,111 --> 01:14:40,480
some sort of condition- which might
speed up the process of acidosis?

1195
01:14:43,218 --> 01:14:45,083
Commander, is it possible?

1196
01:14:45,153 --> 01:14:47,018
It's possible.

1197
01:14:47,089 --> 01:14:49,489
What might some of those
conditions be?

1198
01:14:50,559 --> 01:14:53,050
If a person had a coronary disorder...

1199
01:14:53,128 --> 01:14:56,188
or a cerebral disorder,
the process would be more rapid.

1200
01:14:56,265 --> 01:15:00,292
If I had a coronary condition and
a clean rag was placed in my mouth...

1201
01:15:00,369 --> 01:15:04,135
and the rag was pushed too far down,
is it possible that my cells...

1202
01:15:04,206 --> 01:15:06,970
would continue burning sugar
after the rag was taken out?

1203
01:15:07,042 --> 01:15:09,943
It would have to be
a very serious condition.

1204
01:15:10,012 --> 01:15:12,276
Is it possible to have
a serious coronary condition...

1205
01:15:12,347 --> 01:15:15,783
where the warning signals were so mild
as to escape a physician...

1206
01:15:15,851 --> 01:15:18,376
during a routine medical exam?

1207
01:15:18,453 --> 01:15:21,718
Possibly. There would still
be symptoms, though.

1208
01:15:21,790 --> 01:15:24,122
- What kind of symptoms?
- There are hundreds-

1209
01:15:24,192 --> 01:15:26,490
- Chest pains?
- Yes.

1210
01:15:26,562 --> 01:15:28,496
- Shortness of breath?
- Yes.

1211
01:15:28,564 --> 01:15:30,998
- Fatigue?
- Of course.

1212
01:15:36,605 --> 01:15:38,539
Doctor, is this your signature?

1213
01:15:40,175 --> 01:15:41,301
Yes, it is.

1214
01:15:42,044 --> 01:15:45,707
This is an order for Private Santiago
to be put on restrictive duty.

1215
01:15:45,781 --> 01:15:49,717
Would you read your handwritten remarks
at the bottom of the page, please?

1216
01:15:49,785 --> 01:15:53,983
"Initial testing, negative.
Patient complains of chest pains...

1217
01:15:54,056 --> 01:15:56,217
shortness of breath and fatigue.

1218
01:15:56,291 --> 01:16:00,022
Restricted from running distances
over five miles for one week. "

1219
01:16:02,864 --> 01:16:06,391
Commander, isn't it possible that Santiago
had a serious coronary condition...

1220
01:16:06,468 --> 01:16:11,405
and it was that condition, and not some mysterious poison,
that caused the accelerated chemical reaction?

1221
01:16:11,406 --> 01:16:12,406
No.

1222
01:16:13,075 --> 01:16:14,702
It's not possible?

1223
01:16:14,703 --> 01:16:15,703
No.

1224
01:16:16,178 --> 01:16:19,739
I personally give each man
a thorough physical examination.

1225
01:16:19,815 --> 01:16:22,909
Private Santiago was given
a clean bill of health.

1226
01:16:22,985 --> 01:16:25,545
That's why it had to be poison,
right, Commander?

1227
01:16:25,621 --> 01:16:29,717
'Cause if you put a man with a serious
coronary condition on duty...

1228
01:16:29,791 --> 01:16:32,225
and that man died
from a heart-related incident...

1229
01:16:32,294 --> 01:16:34,285
you'd have a lot to answer for,
wouldn’t you, Doctor?

1230
01:16:34,363 --> 01:16:37,389
- Object! Move to strike.
- Sustained.

1231
01:16:38,667 --> 01:16:40,658
I have no more questions,
Your Honor.

1232
01:16:42,004 --> 01:16:45,405
Dr. Stone, you've held
a medical license for 17 years.

1233
01:16:45,474 --> 01:16:47,635
You're Board-certified
in internal medicine.

1234
01:16:47,709 --> 01:16:53,272
You are chief of internal medicine
at a hospital which serves 5,426 people.

1235
01:16:53,348 --> 01:16:58,217
In your professional medical opinion,
was Willie Santiago poisoned?

1236
01:16:58,286 --> 01:17:01,016
We renew our objection
to Commander Stone's testimony...

1237
01:17:01,089 --> 01:17:03,216
and ask that it be stricken
from the record.

1238
01:17:03,291 --> 01:17:07,227
We further ask the court members to lend
no weight to this witness's testimony.

1239
01:17:07,295 --> 01:17:08,956
The objection is overruled.

1240
01:17:09,031 --> 01:17:13,127
The defense strenuously objects
and requests an 802 conference...

1241
01:17:13,201 --> 01:17:17,331
so that His Honor might have a chance
to hear discussion before ruling.

1242
01:17:17,406 --> 01:17:20,898
The objection of the defense
has been heard and overruled.

1243
01:17:20,976 --> 01:17:23,672
- Move to reconsider.
- Your objection is noted.

1244
01:17:23,745 --> 01:17:27,647
The witness is an expert,
and the court will hear his opinion!

1245
01:17:31,953 --> 01:17:36,788
Dr. Stone, in your expert,
professional opinion...

1246
01:17:36,858 --> 01:17:39,588
was Willie Santiago poisoned?

1247
01:17:39,661 --> 01:17:41,629
Yes.

1248
01:17:41,697 --> 01:17:45,428
Thank you, sir.
I have no more questions.

1249
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:47,593
Commander, you may step down.

1250
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:56,372
Please the court, while we reserve
the right to call rebuttal witnesses...

1251
01:17:56,445 --> 01:17:58,208
the government rests.

1252
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:01,875
We'll stand in recess until 1000,
Monday the 19th...

1253
01:18:01,950 --> 01:18:05,386
at which time, the defense
will call its first witness.

1254
01:18:05,454 --> 01:18:07,388
All rise.

1255
01:18:16,498 --> 01:18:18,625
"I strenuously object"?

1256
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:22,932
Is that how it works?
"Objection overruled. "

1257
01:18:23,004 --> 01:18:25,165
" No, no. I strenuously object. "

1258
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:28,698
"Oh, well, if you strenuously object,
then I should take time to reconsider. "

1259
01:18:28,777 --> 01:18:30,369
I got it on the record.

1260
01:18:30,445 --> 01:18:32,640
You also got the court members
thinking we're afraid of the doctor.

1261
01:18:32,714 --> 01:18:35,410
You object once, so they can hear us say
he's not a criminologist.

1262
01:18:35,484 --> 01:18:39,113
You keep after it, and suddenly it looks
like a bunch of fancy lawyer tricks.

1263
01:18:39,187 --> 01:18:42,281
It's the difference between paper law
and trial law.

1264
01:18:42,357 --> 01:18:44,825
You even had the judge saying
Stone was an expert!

1265
01:18:44,893 --> 01:18:47,760
She made a mistake.
Let's not relive it.

1266
01:18:49,498 --> 01:18:53,059
I'm gonna go call my wife.
I'll see you tonight.

1267
01:18:55,203 --> 01:18:57,603
Why do you hate them so much?

1268
01:18:57,672 --> 01:19:00,140
They beat up on a weakling.
That's all they did.

1269
01:19:00,208 --> 01:19:03,234
The rest of this is just
smoke-filled coffeehouse crap.

1270
01:19:03,311 --> 01:19:06,439
They tortured and tormented
a weaker kid!

1271
01:19:06,515 --> 01:19:08,540
They didn't like him,
so they killed him.

1272
01:19:08,617 --> 01:19:11,518
And why? Because
he couldn't run very fast!

1273
01:19:11,586 --> 01:19:15,249
All right.
Everybody take the night off.

1274
01:19:15,323 --> 01:19:17,257
- I'm sorry.
- I know.

1275
01:19:17,325 --> 01:19:20,089
We've been working 20 hours a day
for three and half weeks straight.

1276
01:19:20,162 --> 01:19:23,529
Just take the night off.
Go see your wife, your daughter.

1277
01:19:23,598 --> 01:19:25,759
Jo, go do...

1278
01:19:27,102 --> 01:19:30,629
whatever it is you do
when you're not here.

1279
01:19:30,705 --> 01:19:33,401
- What day is tomorrow?
- Saturday.

1280
01:19:33,475 --> 01:19:35,409
We start at 10:00.

1281
01:19:39,414 --> 01:19:41,746
Why do you like them so much?

1282
01:19:45,987 --> 01:19:48,182
'Cause they stand on a wall...

1283
01:19:48,256 --> 01:19:52,488
and they say, " Nothing's gonna hurt you
tonight, not on my watch. "

1284
01:19:57,098 --> 01:20:00,431
Don't worry about the doctor.
This trial starts Monday.

1285
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:09,638
One and two, with two out.
And a line drive to left center.

1286
01:20:09,711 --> 01:20:12,942
Kirby racing.
He won’t get there.

1287
01:20:13,014 --> 01:20:16,142
And rounding third is Cal Ripken...

1288
01:20:16,218 --> 01:20:19,381
and the Twins' streak is over.

1289
01:20:22,591 --> 01:20:26,357
One strike away, and Randy Milligan
feels right now like Hulk Hogan.

1290
01:20:29,497 --> 01:20:32,625
I'm sorry to bother you.
I should've called first.

1291
01:20:32,701 --> 01:20:37,070
No, I was just watching
a ball game. Come on in.

1292
01:20:51,987 --> 01:20:57,448
I was wondering if- How you’d feel
about my taking you to dinner tonight?

1293
01:20:57,525 --> 01:21:00,517
- Are you asking me out on a date?
- No.

1294
01:21:00,595 --> 01:21:02,620
Sounded like you
were asking me on a date.

1295
01:21:02,697 --> 01:21:05,723
I've been asked out on dates before,
and that's what it sounded like.

1296
01:21:07,002 --> 01:21:09,163
Do you like seafood?
I know a good seafood place.

1297
01:21:18,013 --> 01:21:20,072
My third case was
a drunk and disorderly.

1298
01:21:20,148 --> 01:21:24,016
It lasted nine weeks. I rounded up
31 people from the bar that night.

1299
01:21:24,085 --> 01:21:27,521
Nine weeks on a D and D?
What was the prosecutor offering?

1300
01:21:27,589 --> 01:21:29,523
Fifteen days.

1301
01:21:32,327 --> 01:21:33,988
You sure hustled
the shit out of him.

1302
01:21:34,062 --> 01:21:36,428
Well, after that
they moved me to Internal Affairs.

1303
01:21:36,498 --> 01:21:38,489
- Tough to blame them.
- Where I have earned...

1304
01:21:38,566 --> 01:21:42,263
two meritorious service medals
and two letters of commendation.

1305
01:21:42,337 --> 01:21:45,363
Why are you always giving me
your resume?

1306
01:21:49,244 --> 01:21:51,178
Because I want you to think
I'm a good lawyer.

1307
01:21:51,246 --> 01:21:53,271
I do.

1308
01:21:53,348 --> 01:21:55,543
No, you don't.

1309
01:21:58,987 --> 01:22:01,251
I think you’re an exceptional lawyer.

1310
01:22:02,057 --> 01:22:06,687
I watch the court members.
They respond to you. They like you.

1311
01:22:06,761 --> 01:22:09,389
I see you convincing them,
and I think Dawson and Downey...

1312
01:22:09,464 --> 01:22:12,126
are gonna end up
owing their lives to you.

1313
01:22:15,770 --> 01:22:17,704
Jo, I think-

1314
01:22:19,407 --> 01:22:23,070
I think you should prepare yourself
for the fact that we're gonna lose.

1315
01:22:23,144 --> 01:22:26,511
Ross's opening statement-
it was all true.

1316
01:22:26,581 --> 01:22:29,345
Let's pretend for a minute
that it would actually matter...

1317
01:22:29,417 --> 01:22:31,510
that the guys
were given an order.

1318
01:22:31,586 --> 01:22:34,214
I can't prove it ever happened.

1319
01:22:34,289 --> 01:22:36,780
We'll keep doing what we're doing
and we'll put on a show...

1320
01:22:36,858 --> 01:22:42,262
but all we have is the testimony
of two people accused of murder.

1321
01:22:43,465 --> 01:22:45,330
We'll find Markinson.

1322
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:49,894
Jo, we're gonna lose,
and we're gonna lose huge.

1323
01:22:53,108 --> 01:22:56,407
Corporal Jeffrey Owen Barnes,
Marine Barracks Windward...

1324
01:22:56,478 --> 01:22:58,503
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

1325
01:22:58,580 --> 01:23:02,914
Corporal Barnes, name some reasons
why a Marine would receive a Code Red.

1326
01:23:02,984 --> 01:23:06,385
Being late for platoon
or company meetings.

1327
01:23:06,454 --> 01:23:10,356
Keeping his barracks in disorder.
Falling back on a run.

1328
01:23:10,425 --> 01:23:12,916
- Have you ever received a Code Red?
- Yes, sir.

1329
01:23:12,994 --> 01:23:16,555
We were doing seven-man assault drills,
and my weapon slipped.

1330
01:23:16,631 --> 01:23:19,930
It was 'cause it was over 100 degrees,
and my palms were sweaty...

1331
01:23:20,001 --> 01:23:23,664
and I'd forgotten to use the resin
like we were taught.

1332
01:23:23,738 --> 01:23:25,262
What happened?

1333
01:23:25,340 --> 01:23:28,400
That night, the guys in my squad
threw a blanket over me...

1334
01:23:28,476 --> 01:23:31,309
took turns punching me in the arm
for five minutes...

1335
01:23:31,379 --> 01:23:33,973
then they poured glue on my hands.

1336
01:23:34,049 --> 01:23:37,746
And it worked too, 'cause
I ain't never dropped my weapon since.

1337
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:42,280
Was Private Santiago ever late
for platoon meetings?

1338
01:23:42,357 --> 01:23:43,517
Yes, sir.

1339
01:23:43,591 --> 01:23:45,957
- Was his barracks ever in disorder?
- Yes, sir.

1340
01:23:46,027 --> 01:23:48,359
- Did he ever fall back on a run?
- All the time, sir.

1341
01:23:48,430 --> 01:23:53,800
Did he ever, prior to the night
of September 6, receive a Code Red?

1342
01:23:53,868 --> 01:23:55,358
No, sir.

1343
01:23:55,437 --> 01:23:57,496
- Never?
- No, sir.

1344
01:23:59,174 --> 01:24:01,540
You got a Code Red
'cause your palms were sweaty.

1345
01:24:01,609 --> 01:24:05,670
Why didn't Santiago,
this burden to his unit, ever get one?

1346
01:24:07,148 --> 01:24:09,173
Dawson wouldn't allow it, sir.

1347
01:24:10,285 --> 01:24:12,344
Dawson wouldn't allow it.

1348
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:16,015
The guys talked tough about Santiago,
but they wouldn’t go near him.

1349
01:24:16,091 --> 01:24:18,025
They were too afraid of Dawson.

1350
01:24:18,093 --> 01:24:20,561
Object.
The witness is speculating.

1351
01:24:20,628 --> 01:24:24,291
I'll rephrase. Jeffrey, did you ever
want to give Santiago a Code Red?

1352
01:24:24,365 --> 01:24:26,333
- Yes, sir.
- Why didn’t you?

1353
01:24:26,401 --> 01:24:29,199
'Cause Dawson
would kick my butt, sir.

1354
01:24:29,270 --> 01:24:33,206
Good enough. Captain Ross
is gonna ask you some questions now.

1355
01:24:34,576 --> 01:24:36,510
Corporal Barnes...

1356
01:24:37,979 --> 01:24:40,470
I hold here the Marine Outline
for Recruit Training.

1357
01:24:40,548 --> 01:24:42,311
- Are you familiar with this book?
- Yes, sir.

1358
01:24:42,383 --> 01:24:44,044
- Have you read it?
- Yes, sir.

1359
01:24:44,119 --> 01:24:47,418
Would you turn to the chapter
that deals with Code Reds, please?

1360
01:24:49,991 --> 01:24:53,552
Just flip to the page of the book
that discusses Code Reds.

1361
01:24:55,830 --> 01:24:59,288
Well, you see, sir, Code Red
is a term that we use.

1362
01:24:59,367 --> 01:25:01,062
Just down in Gitmo-

1363
01:25:01,136 --> 01:25:03,229
Oh, we're in luck, then.

1364
01:25:06,541 --> 01:25:10,978
Standard Operating Procedure, Rifle
Security Company, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

1365
01:25:11,045 --> 01:25:15,038
I assume we'll find the term Code Red
and its definition in that book.

1366
01:25:15,116 --> 01:25:16,981
No, sir.

1367
01:25:17,051 --> 01:25:18,848
Corporal Barnes, I'm a Marine.

1368
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:23,050
Is there no book, no manual or pamphlet,
no set of orders or regulations...

1369
01:25:23,124 --> 01:25:27,652
that lets me know that as a Marine one
of my duties is to perform Code Reds?

1370
01:25:27,729 --> 01:25:31,165
No, sir.
No book, sir.

1371
01:25:31,232 --> 01:25:33,166
No further questions.

1372
01:25:35,236 --> 01:25:37,796
Corporal, would you turn
to the page in this book...

1373
01:25:37,872 --> 01:25:40,272
that says where
the mess hall is, please?

1374
01:25:40,341 --> 01:25:43,435
Lieutenant Kaffee,
that's not in the book, sir.

1375
01:25:44,979 --> 01:25:47,914
You mean to say in all your time
at Gitmo you've never had a meal?

1376
01:25:47,982 --> 01:25:51,145
No, sir.
Three squares a day, sir.

1377
01:25:51,953 --> 01:25:53,545
I don't understand.

1378
01:25:53,621 --> 01:25:56,681
How did you know where the mess hall was
if it’s not in this book?

1379
01:25:59,294 --> 01:26:02,457
Well, I guess I just followed the crowd
at chow time, sir.

1380
01:26:03,431 --> 01:26:05,626
No more questions.

1381
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:09,363
- Corporal Barnes, you may step down.
- Thank you, sir.

1382
01:26:14,976 --> 01:26:17,467
7:00 tonight we'll do
a final Kendrick review.

1383
01:26:17,545 --> 01:26:20,446
I want to slam-dunk this guy.

1384
01:26:31,893 --> 01:26:33,451
Hey, Luther.

1385
01:26:33,528 --> 01:26:36,019
Admiral, how's
the big case going?

1386
01:26:36,097 --> 01:26:38,065
Nose to the grindstone.

1387
01:26:38,132 --> 01:26:41,295
- No flies on you.
- A rolling stone gathers no moss.

1388
01:26:41,369 --> 01:26:43,894
Well, it ain't over
till the fat lady sings.

1389
01:26:43,972 --> 01:26:46,338
You can say that again.

1390
01:26:46,407 --> 01:26:49,706
- It ain't over till the fat lady sings.
- Till the fat lady sings.

1391
01:26:50,812 --> 01:26:52,746
Walked into that one.

1392
01:27:04,292 --> 01:27:07,022
Oh, Jesus Christ!

1393
01:27:07,095 --> 01:27:09,757
You left the door unlocked.

1394
01:27:09,831 --> 01:27:12,891
- You scared the shit out of me.
-Just keep driving.

1395
01:27:12,967 --> 01:27:14,901
Are you aware
you're under subpoena?

1396
01:27:14,969 --> 01:27:18,769
Yes. I'm also aware that the lives
of two Marines are in your hands.

1397
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:21,001
If there was something
I could do about that, I would.

1398
01:27:21,075 --> 01:27:23,475
But since I can't,
all I can do is help you.

1399
01:27:23,544 --> 01:27:25,876
- What do you know?
- I know everything.

1400
01:27:25,947 --> 01:27:28,177
- Was it a Code Red?
- Yes.

1401
01:27:28,249 --> 01:27:30,376
- Did Kendrick give the order?
- Yes.

1402
01:27:30,451 --> 01:27:33,386
- Did you witness it?
- I didn't need to.

1403
01:27:33,454 --> 01:27:36,082
Then how do you know?
- I know. - You know shit.

1404
01:27:36,157 --> 01:27:38,523
He was never gonna be transferred
off that base.

1405
01:27:44,465 --> 01:27:47,764
Jessup was gonna keep him on the base.
He said he wanted him trained.

1406
01:27:47,835 --> 01:27:50,429
- The transfer order has your signature.
- Yeah, I know.

1407
01:27:50,505 --> 01:27:54,464
I signed it the morning you arrived
in Cuba, five days after Santiago died.

1408
01:27:58,146 --> 01:28:00,910
I'm gonna get you a deal, some kind
of immunity with the prosecutor.

1409
01:28:00,982 --> 01:28:05,476
In about four days, you'll appear
as a witness and tell what you know.

1410
01:28:05,553 --> 01:28:09,182
I'm gonna check you into a motel.
We are gonna start from the beginning.

1411
01:28:09,257 --> 01:28:13,421
I don't want a deal,
and I don't want immunity.

1412
01:28:13,494 --> 01:28:18,727
I want you to know that I'm proud
neither of what I've done or am doing.

1413
01:28:21,069 --> 01:28:23,037
- Where is he?
- The Downtown Lodge in Northeast.

1414
01:28:23,104 --> 01:28:25,231
- I want him guarded.
- That's a good idea.

1415
01:28:25,306 --> 01:28:28,002
- My clearance code is 411527273.
- Clearance code?

1416
01:28:28,076 --> 01:28:30,738
- Thank you.
- Do you have a clearance code?

1417
01:28:30,812 --> 01:28:32,939
This is Jo Galloway.
I need to secure a witness.

1418
01:28:33,014 --> 01:28:35,983
Anyway, he also said that Jessup’s lying
about the transportation off the base.

1419
01:28:36,050 --> 01:28:38,848
Jessup said that 6:00 the next morning
was the first flight Santiago could have left on.

1420
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:42,412
Markinson says there was a plane
that left seven hours earlier.

1421
01:28:42,490 --> 01:28:45,516
That was impressive. Did you hear
what I said about the flight?

1422
01:28:45,593 --> 01:28:48,858
Sam, when a flight takes off,
there's a record kept, right?

1423
01:28:48,930 --> 01:28:51,125
Yeah, you need the tower chief’s log
from Gitmo.

1424
01:28:51,199 --> 01:28:54,327
- Get it.
- We're gonna win.

1425
01:28:54,402 --> 01:28:56,768
We don't know who Markinson is.
We don't know what the logbook will say.

1426
01:28:56,838 --> 01:28:59,864
You just concentrate on Downey.
I'm gonna talk to Ross and tell him where we are.

1427
01:29:06,981 --> 01:29:10,417
Nice work today.
Redirect on Barnes.

1428
01:29:10,485 --> 01:29:14,615
- I have Markinson.
- Where is he?

1429
01:29:14,689 --> 01:29:19,023
Motel room in Northeast with
six Federal Marshalls outside his door.

1430
01:29:19,093 --> 01:29:21,254
The transfer that Markinson
signed is phony.

1431
01:29:21,329 --> 01:29:24,162
Jessup's statement that the 6:00 a. m.
flight was the first available is a lie.

1432
01:29:24,232 --> 01:29:26,666
We're checking the tower chief’s log.
I'd like a beer, please.

1433
01:29:26,734 --> 01:29:31,171
In the meantime, I'm gonna put Kendrick
on the stand and have some fun.

1434
01:29:31,239 --> 01:29:34,003
All right, I have
an obligation to tell you...

1435
01:29:34,075 --> 01:29:37,169
that if you accuse Kendrick or Jessup
of any crime without proper evidence...

1436
01:29:37,245 --> 01:29:40,009
you'll be subject to a court-martial
for professional misconduct.

1437
01:29:40,081 --> 01:29:44,575
That's something that'll be stapled to
every job application you ever fill out.

1438
01:29:46,254 --> 01:29:49,815
Markinson's not gonna hold up, Danny.
He's a crazy man.

1439
01:29:49,891 --> 01:29:53,520
I'm not saying this to intimidate you.
I'm being your lawyer here.

1440
01:29:53,594 --> 01:29:57,690
Thanks, Jack. And I think the fucking
bunch of you are certifiably insane.

1441
01:29:57,765 --> 01:30:00,097
Your code of honor makes me
want to beat the shit out of somebody.

1442
01:30:00,168 --> 01:30:04,036
Don't lump me in with them
just because we wear the same uniform.

1443
01:30:04,105 --> 01:30:07,165
I'm your friend, and I don't think
your clients belong in jail...

1444
01:30:07,241 --> 01:30:09,175
but I don't get
to make that decision.

1445
01:30:09,243 --> 01:30:13,646
I represent the United States government
without passion or prejudice.

1446
01:30:13,714 --> 01:30:17,047
- My client has a case.
- Here you go.

1447
01:30:20,888 --> 01:30:23,686
I want you to acknowledge that
the judge advocate has made you aware...

1448
01:30:23,758 --> 01:30:26,625
of the possible consequences involved
in accusing a Marine officer...

1449
01:30:26,694 --> 01:30:28,787
of a felony
without proper evidence.

1450
01:30:28,863 --> 01:30:31,525
I've been so advised.

1451
01:30:35,736 --> 01:30:38,534
You got bullied
into that courtroom, Danny.

1452
01:30:38,606 --> 01:30:42,474
By everyone.
By Dawson, by Galloway.

1453
01:30:42,543 --> 01:30:45,103
Shit, I practically dared you.

1454
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:49,807
You got bullied into that courtroom
by the memory of a dead lawyer.

1455
01:30:55,923 --> 01:30:59,051
You're a lousy fucking
softball player, Jack!

1456
01:31:02,430 --> 01:31:06,594
Your boys are going down, Danny.
I can't stop it anymore.

1457
01:31:11,906 --> 01:31:15,239
Lieutenant Kendrick, in your opinion,
was Private Santiago a good Marine?

1458
01:31:15,309 --> 01:31:17,402
I'd say he was about average.

1459
01:31:17,478 --> 01:31:20,879
You signed three proficiency
and conduct reports on Santiago.

1460
01:31:20,948 --> 01:31:24,611
On all three reports, you indicate
a rating of below average.

1461
01:31:27,989 --> 01:31:31,925
Yes, Private Santiago
was below average.

1462
01:31:31,993 --> 01:31:35,759
I did not see the need
to trample on a man's grave.

1463
01:31:35,830 --> 01:31:37,991
We appreciate that,
but you’re under oath now.

1464
01:31:38,065 --> 01:31:40,693
Unpleasant as it may be,
we'd all just as soon hear the truth.

1465
01:31:40,768 --> 01:31:42,633
I'm aware of my oath.

1466
01:31:42,703 --> 01:31:47,663
These are the last three pro-con reports
you signed for Lance Corporal Dawson.

1467
01:31:47,742 --> 01:31:49,676
Dawson received
two marks of exceptional...

1468
01:31:49,744 --> 01:31:54,113
but on this most recent report of June 9
he received a rating of below average.

1469
01:31:54,181 --> 01:31:58,174
- I'd like to discuss this last report.
- That would be fine.

1470
01:31:58,252 --> 01:32:01,915
Lance Corporal Dawson's ranking after
the school of infantry was perfect.

1471
01:32:01,989 --> 01:32:04,924
Over half that class has since
been promoted to full corporal...

1472
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:07,290
while Dawson has remained
a lance corporal.

1473
01:32:07,361 --> 01:32:10,353
Was Dawson's promotion held up
because of this last report?

1474
01:32:10,431 --> 01:32:12,365
I'm sure it was.

1475
01:32:12,433 --> 01:32:15,425
Do you recall why Dawson was given
such a poor grade on this report?

1476
01:32:15,503 --> 01:32:16,800
I'm sure I don't.

1477
01:32:16,871 --> 01:32:20,705
I have many men in my charge.
I write many reports.

1478
01:32:20,775 --> 01:32:26,543
Lieutenant, do you recall an incident
involving a P.F.C. Curtis Bell...

1479
01:32:26,614 --> 01:32:29,344
who'd been found stealing liquor
from the Officers' Club?

1480
01:32:29,417 --> 01:32:31,317
Yes, I do.

1481
01:32:31,385 --> 01:32:33,819
Did you report Private Bell
to proper authorities?

1482
01:32:35,723 --> 01:32:37,884
I have two books at my bedside-

1483
01:32:37,959 --> 01:32:40,951
The Marine Corps Code of Conduct
and The King James Bible.

1484
01:32:41,028 --> 01:32:43,622
The only proper authorities I'm aware of
are my commanding officer...

1485
01:32:43,698 --> 01:32:46,360
Colonel Nathan R. Jessup
and the Lord our God.

1486
01:32:47,969 --> 01:32:50,529
At your request, Lieutenant Kendrick,
I can have the record reflect...

1487
01:32:50,605 --> 01:32:53,267
your lack of acknowledgement
of this court as a proper authority.

1488
01:32:53,341 --> 01:32:56,174
- Objection. Argumentative.
- Sustained.

1489
01:32:56,243 --> 01:32:58,336
Watch yourself, counselor.

1490
01:32:58,412 --> 01:33:01,108
Did you report Private Bell
to your superiors?

1491
01:33:01,182 --> 01:33:03,946
I remember thinking very highly
of Private Bell-

1492
01:33:04,018 --> 01:33:07,181
not wanting to see his record tarnished
by a formal charge.

1493
01:33:08,356 --> 01:33:11,223
You preferred it be handled
within the unit?

1494
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:14,894
Yes, I most certainly did.

1495
01:33:16,130 --> 01:33:19,361
- Do you know what a Code Red is?
- Yes, I do.

1496
01:33:19,433 --> 01:33:22,630
- Have you ever ordered a Code Red?
- No, I have not.

1497
01:33:22,703 --> 01:33:25,797
Did you order Dawson and two other men
to make sure that Private Bell...

1498
01:33:25,873 --> 01:33:31,311
received no food or drink, except water,
for a period of seven days?

1499
01:33:31,379 --> 01:33:33,677
That is a distortion
of the truth, Lieutenant.

1500
01:33:33,748 --> 01:33:36,012
Private Bell was placed
on barracks restriction.

1501
01:33:36,083 --> 01:33:39,177
He was given water and vitamin
supplements, and I can assure you...

1502
01:33:39,253 --> 01:33:43,212
at no time
was his health in danger.

1503
01:33:43,290 --> 01:33:46,020
I'm sure it was lovely
for Private Bell.

1504
01:33:46,093 --> 01:33:48,755
But you did order
the barracks restriction, didn’t you?

1505
01:33:48,829 --> 01:33:52,993
- You did order the denial of food?
- Yes, I did.

1506
01:33:53,067 --> 01:33:56,867
Wouldn't this form of discipline
be considered a Code Red?

1507
01:33:57,868 --> 01:33:58,868
No.

1508
01:33:59,674 --> 01:34:03,542
If I called the other 478 Marines
at Guantanamo Bay to testify...

1509
01:34:03,611 --> 01:34:05,704
would they consider it
a Code Red?

1510
01:34:05,780 --> 01:34:09,739
The witness can't possibly testify
as to what 478 other men would say.

1511
01:34:09,817 --> 01:34:13,685
We object to this entire line
of questioning. It's argumentative...

1512
01:34:13,754 --> 01:34:16,120
and irrelevant badgering
of the witness.

1513
01:34:16,190 --> 01:34:18,818
The government's objection
is sustained, Lieutenant Kaffee...

1514
01:34:18,893 --> 01:34:22,021
and I would remind you that you’re now
questioning a Marine officer...

1515
01:34:22,096 --> 01:34:24,223
with an impeccable service record.

1516
01:34:24,298 --> 01:34:25,856
Thank you, Your Honor.

1517
01:34:26,934 --> 01:34:30,734
Lieutenant, was Dawson given a rating
of below average on this last report...

1518
01:34:30,805 --> 01:34:33,672
because you learned he'd been sneaking
food to Private Bell?

1519
01:34:33,741 --> 01:34:37,006
- Object!
- Not so fast. Lieutenant?

1520
01:34:38,679 --> 01:34:42,342
Lance Corporal Dawson
was given a below average rating...

1521
01:34:43,317 --> 01:34:45,785
because he had committed a crime.

1522
01:34:45,853 --> 01:34:49,118
A crime?
What crime did he commit?

1523
01:34:53,027 --> 01:34:58,795
Dawson brought a hungry guy some food.
What crime did he commit?

1524
01:35:00,801 --> 01:35:02,359
He disobeyed an order.

1525
01:35:02,436 --> 01:35:04,927
And because he exercised
his own set of values...

1526
01:35:05,005 --> 01:35:07,997
because he made a decision
about the welfare of a Marine...

1527
01:35:08,075 --> 01:35:11,704
that was in conflict with your order,
he was punished, is that right?

1528
01:35:11,779 --> 01:35:15,306
Lance Corporal Dawson
disobeyed an order.

1529
01:35:15,382 --> 01:35:17,907
Yeah, but it wasn't
a real order, was it?

1530
01:35:17,985 --> 01:35:20,180
After all, it's peacetime.

1531
01:35:20,254 --> 01:35:23,519
He wasn't being asked to secure a hill
or advance on a beachhead.

1532
01:35:23,591 --> 01:35:28,028
I mean, surely a Marine
of Dawson's intelligence...

1533
01:35:28,095 --> 01:35:31,189
can be trusted to determine on his own
which are the important orders...

1534
01:35:31,265 --> 01:35:35,167
and which orders might, say,
be morally questionable?

1535
01:35:38,405 --> 01:35:40,202
Can he?

1536
01:35:40,274 --> 01:35:43,937
Can Dawson determine on his own
which orders he's going to follow?

1537
01:35:44,011 --> 01:35:45,706
No, he cannot.

1538
01:35:45,780 --> 01:35:48,510
A lesson he learned
after the Curtis Bell incident, right?

1539
01:35:48,582 --> 01:35:51,449
- I would think so.
- You know so, don’t you?

1540
01:35:51,519 --> 01:35:53,214
- Object!
- Sustained.

1541
01:35:55,256 --> 01:35:58,191
Lieutenant Kendrick,
one final question.

1542
01:35:59,493 --> 01:36:02,792
If you had ordered Dawson
to give Santiago a Code Red-

1543
01:36:02,863 --> 01:36:07,095
- I specifically ordered those men-
- Would he disobey you again?

1544
01:36:07,168 --> 01:36:11,229
- Lieutenant, don't answer that!
- You don't have to. I'm through.

1545
01:36:11,305 --> 01:36:14,934
Lieutenant Kendrick, did you order
Lance Corporal Dawson...

1546
01:36:15,009 --> 01:36:18,968
and Private Downey
to give Willie Santiago a Code Red?

1547
01:36:22,183 --> 01:36:25,152
- No, I did not.
- Thank you.

1548
01:36:29,123 --> 01:36:31,284
What's the word?

1549
01:36:31,358 --> 01:36:35,624
I got the tower chief’s log from that
night. Jessup’s telling the truth.

1550
01:36:35,696 --> 01:36:39,928
- 6:00 a. m. flight was the first plane.
- Let me see this.

1551
01:36:50,110 --> 01:36:52,977
- Working late tonight?
- Oh, yeah.

1552
01:36:57,351 --> 01:37:01,048
There wasn't a flight at 11:00.
What the fuck are you trying to pull?

1553
01:37:01,121 --> 01:37:04,352
The first flight stateside
left Guantanamo Bay at 2300.

1554
01:37:04,425 --> 01:37:08,361
It arrived at Andrews Air Force Base
at a few minutes past 2:00.

1555
01:37:08,429 --> 01:37:11,626
Really? Then why isn't it
listed in the tower chief’s log?

1556
01:37:13,734 --> 01:37:15,031
Jessup.

1557
01:37:15,102 --> 01:37:17,536
What are you telling me?
He fixed the logbook?

1558
01:37:19,573 --> 01:37:23,600
Maybe he can make it so a plane didn't
take off, but I can prove one landed.

1559
01:37:23,677 --> 01:37:25,770
I'll get the logbook from Andrews.

1560
01:37:25,846 --> 01:37:28,815
You're not gonna find anything
in the Andrews logbook, either.

1561
01:37:28,883 --> 01:37:30,817
He can make
an entire flight disappear?

1562
01:37:30,885 --> 01:37:35,379
Jessup is about to be appointed director
of operations for the Security Council.

1563
01:37:35,456 --> 01:37:39,449
You don't get to that position without
knowing how to sidestep some land mines.

1564
01:37:39,526 --> 01:37:42,393
He's not gonna be able
to sidestep you.

1565
01:37:42,463 --> 01:37:44,863
You don't still intend
to put me on the stand?

1566
01:37:44,932 --> 01:37:47,867
Thursday morning, 10:00.

1567
01:37:52,306 --> 01:37:56,140
There's gotta be someone
who can testify to the flight.

1568
01:37:56,210 --> 01:37:59,441
This isn't TWA.
There isn't a regular flight schedule.

1569
01:37:59,513 --> 01:38:02,311
Do you have any idea how many planes
take off and land every day?

1570
01:38:02,383 --> 01:38:05,819
A ground crew kid won't remember
a flight that landed four weeks ago.

1571
01:38:05,886 --> 01:38:09,049
- How do you know if you don't check?
- Forget the flight!

1572
01:38:09,123 --> 01:38:12,923
Markinson will testify that Jessup
refused to transfer Santiago.

1573
01:38:12,993 --> 01:38:15,553
He'll testify to the forged transfer,
and that'll be enough.

1574
01:38:15,629 --> 01:38:18,154
That and Downey's testimony
really ought to be enough.

1575
01:38:23,671 --> 01:38:27,630
Why did you go into Santiago's room
on the night of the 6th?

1576
01:38:27,708 --> 01:38:30,939
To give Private Santiago
a Code Red, ma'am.

1577
01:38:31,011 --> 01:38:33,206
Why did you give him a Code Red?

1578
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:36,716
I was ordered to give him a Code Red
by the platoon commander...

1579
01:38:36,784 --> 01:38:41,016
of Rifle Security Company Windward,
Lieutenant Jonathan James Kendrick.

1580
01:38:42,222 --> 01:38:44,622
You're gonna do fine.

1581
01:38:46,226 --> 01:38:48,717
You think they'll let us go back
to our platoon soon, ma'am?

1582
01:38:50,164 --> 01:38:52,064
Absolutely.

1583
01:38:55,269 --> 01:38:57,703
Do you remember the order of questions?
Are you sure?

1584
01:38:57,771 --> 01:39:00,706
And we'll use small words, 'cause he
gets rattled if he doesn't understand.

1585
01:39:00,774 --> 01:39:03,675
- I'm just saying go slow.
- I'm gonna go slow.

1586
01:39:03,744 --> 01:39:06,679
And get him off
as fast as you can.

1587
01:39:06,747 --> 01:39:09,682
What?
It's gonna be fine.

1588
01:39:12,119 --> 01:39:14,087
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Santiago...

1589
01:39:15,422 --> 01:39:17,890
I was William's executive officer.

1590
01:39:17,958 --> 01:39:21,450
I knew your son vaguely,
which is to say I knew his name.

1591
01:39:22,529 --> 01:39:24,520
In a matter of time,
the trial of the two men...

1592
01:39:24,598 --> 01:39:27,294
charged with your son's death
will be concluded...

1593
01:39:27,368 --> 01:39:29,632
and seven men and two women
whom you've never met...

1594
01:39:29,703 --> 01:39:33,696
will try to offer you an explanation
as to why William is dead.

1595
01:39:33,774 --> 01:39:37,403
For my part, I've done as much as I can
to bring the truth to light.

1596
01:39:38,278 --> 01:39:39,802
And the truth is this-

1597
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:42,440
Your son is dead for only one reason-

1598
01:39:42,516 --> 01:39:45,451
I wasn't strong enough to stop it.

1599
01:39:45,519 --> 01:39:49,922
Always, Lieutenant Colonel
Matthew Andrew Markinson...

1600
01:39:49,990 --> 01:39:51,480
United States Marine Corps.

1601
01:39:56,630 --> 01:40:00,157
Private, I want you
to tell us one last time.

1602
01:40:00,234 --> 01:40:06,070
Why did you go to Private Santiago's
room on the night of September 6?

1603
01:40:06,140 --> 01:40:08,540
A Code Red was ordered
by my platoon commander...

1604
01:40:08,609 --> 01:40:10,941
Lieutenant Jonathan James Kendrick.

1605
01:40:11,512 --> 01:40:13,275
Thank you.

1606
01:40:13,347 --> 01:40:14,939
Your witness.

1607
01:40:19,486 --> 01:40:21,681
Private, the week of 2 September...

1608
01:40:21,755 --> 01:40:25,247
the switch log has you down
at Post 39 until 1600.

1609
01:40:25,325 --> 01:40:26,519
Is that correct?

1610
01:40:26,593 --> 01:40:29,528
I'm sure it is, sir.
They keep that log pretty good.

1611
01:40:29,596 --> 01:40:33,191
How far is it from Post 39
to the Windward Barracks?

1612
01:40:33,267 --> 01:40:36,725
Well, it's a ways, sir.
It's a hike.

1613
01:40:36,804 --> 01:40:39,637
About how far by Jeep?

1614
01:40:39,706 --> 01:40:43,073
About ten or fifteen minutes, sir.

1615
01:40:43,143 --> 01:40:45,043
You ever had to walk it?

1616
01:40:45,112 --> 01:40:48,946
Yes, sir. That day, Friday.
The pickup private-

1617
01:40:49,016 --> 01:40:52,076
That's what we call the guy
who drops us off and picks us up...

1618
01:40:52,152 --> 01:40:55,349
also 'cause he can get girls
in New York City.

1619
01:40:56,390 --> 01:40:58,551
The pickup private got a flat,
sir, right at 39.

1620
01:40:58,625 --> 01:41:01,458
He pulled up and, bam,
blowout with no spare.

1621
01:41:01,528 --> 01:41:03,587
So we had to double-time it
back to the barracks.

1622
01:41:03,664 --> 01:41:07,361
And if it’s about ten or fifteen
minutes by Jeep, I'm guessing...

1623
01:41:07,434 --> 01:41:10,494
it must be a good hour by foot,
am I right?

1624
01:41:10,571 --> 01:41:13,665
Pickup and me did it
in 45 flat, sir.

1625
01:41:13,740 --> 01:41:15,173
Not bad.

1626
01:41:16,610 --> 01:41:20,046
You've said that your assault
on Private Santiago...

1627
01:41:20,114 --> 01:41:23,379
was a result of an order
that Lieutenant Kendrick gave you...

1628
01:41:23,450 --> 01:41:27,011
in your barracks room
at 1620, am I right?

1629
01:41:28,155 --> 01:41:29,747
Yes, sir.

1630
01:41:29,823 --> 01:41:33,623
But you just said that you didn't
make it back to the barracks until 1645.

1631
01:41:34,964 --> 01:41:35,824
Sir?

1632
01:41:36,196 --> 01:41:40,326
Well, if you didn't make it back
to the barracks until 1645...

1633
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:42,595
how could you be
in your room at 1620?

1634
01:41:43,637 --> 01:41:46,435
Well, you see, sir,
there was a blowout-

1635
01:41:46,507 --> 01:41:50,409
Did you ever actually hear
Lieutenant Kendrick order a Code Red?

1636
01:41:50,477 --> 01:41:52,206
Well, Hal said that-

1637
01:41:52,279 --> 01:41:54,804
Private, did you ever
actually hear...

1638
01:41:54,882 --> 01:41:57,612
Lieutenant Kendrick
order a Code Red?

1639
01:41:57,913 --> 01:41:59,313
No, sir.

1640
01:41:59,386 --> 01:42:02,719
I'd like to request a recess
in order to confer with my client.

1641
01:42:02,789 --> 01:42:05,121
- Why did you go into Santiago's room?
- The witness has rights!

1642
01:42:05,192 --> 01:42:08,457
- The witness has been read his rights.
- The question will be repeated.

1643
01:42:08,529 --> 01:42:10,463
Why did you go
into Santiago's room?

1644
01:42:10,531 --> 01:42:13,967
Did Lance Corporal Dawson tell you
to give Santiago a Code Red?

1645
01:42:14,034 --> 01:42:15,797
- Don't look at him!
- Hal!

1646
01:42:15,869 --> 01:42:17,803
Answer the captain's question!

1647
01:42:21,108 --> 01:42:23,440
Yes, Captain, I was given an order
by my squad leader...

1648
01:42:23,510 --> 01:42:26,843
Lance Corporal Harold W. Dawson,
United States Marine Corps...

1649
01:42:26,914 --> 01:42:28,176
and I followed it.

1650
01:42:49,603 --> 01:42:51,264
Where do you think he is?

1651
01:42:53,540 --> 01:42:56,304
As far as Downey was concerned,
it was an order from Kendrick.

1652
01:42:56,376 --> 01:42:58,344
It doesn't matter that
he didn't hear it firsthand.

1653
01:42:58,412 --> 01:43:01,472
He doesn't distinguish
between the two.

1654
01:43:05,652 --> 01:43:07,950
Danny, I'm sorry.

1655
01:43:08,855 --> 01:43:10,413
Don't worry about it.

1656
01:43:10,490 --> 01:43:13,050
Sam and I were just talking about
how all we really have to do...

1657
01:43:13,126 --> 01:43:15,993
is call some witnesses
who will talk about implied orders.

1658
01:43:16,063 --> 01:43:18,623
Maybe we can put Downey back
on the stand before we get to Dawson.

1659
01:43:19,399 --> 01:43:24,029
If we work at it, we can get Dawson
charged with the Kennedy assassination.

1660
01:43:27,341 --> 01:43:28,501
Are you drunk?

1661
01:43:29,376 --> 01:43:32,140
Pretty much.

1662
01:43:32,212 --> 01:43:34,544
Yeah.

1663
01:43:34,615 --> 01:43:38,176
I'll put on a pot of coffee.
We've got a long night's work ahead.

1664
01:43:39,319 --> 01:43:41,719
She's gonna make coffee.

1665
01:43:42,856 --> 01:43:44,824
That's nice.

1666
01:43:48,762 --> 01:43:51,595
Downey wasn’t in his room.

1667
01:43:51,665 --> 01:43:53,565
Wasn't even there.

1668
01:43:55,002 --> 01:43:58,199
That was an important piece
of information, don’t you think?

1669
01:44:00,674 --> 01:44:04,974
Danny, it was a setback,
and I'm sorry.

1670
01:44:05,045 --> 01:44:07,741
But we fix it,
and move on to Markinson.

1671
01:44:09,483 --> 01:44:11,212
Markinson's dead.

1672
01:44:17,090 --> 01:44:21,117
You really gotta hand it
to those Federal Marshals, boy.

1673
01:44:21,194 --> 01:44:23,856
It's not like he hanged himself
by his shoelaces...

1674
01:44:23,930 --> 01:44:26,558
or slashed his wrists
with a concealed butter knife.

1675
01:44:26,633 --> 01:44:28,066
This guy...

1676
01:44:30,003 --> 01:44:33,666
got into full dress uniform,
stood in the middle of that room...

1677
01:44:33,740 --> 01:44:36,903
drew a nickel-plated pistol
from his holster...

1678
01:44:36,977 --> 01:44:39,377
and fired a bullet into his mouth.

1679
01:44:43,283 --> 01:44:47,151
Anyway, since we seem to be out of
witnesses, I thought I'd drink a little.

1680
01:44:47,220 --> 01:44:49,415
I still think we can win.

1681
01:44:51,458 --> 01:44:53,085
Maybe you should drink a little.

1682
01:44:53,160 --> 01:44:58,154
We'll go to Randolph in the morning and
make a motion for a 24-hour continuance.

1683
01:44:58,231 --> 01:45:01,496
- Why would we want to do that?
- To subpoena Colonel Jessup.

1684
01:45:02,669 --> 01:45:05,433
- What?
- Listen for a second. Hear me out.

1685
01:45:05,434 --> 01:45:07,530
No. I won't listen,
and I won't hear you out.

1686
01:45:07,607 --> 01:45:09,905
Your passion is compelling, Jo.
It's also useless.

1687
01:45:09,976 --> 01:45:13,104
Louden Downey
needed a trial lawyer today.

1688
01:45:16,116 --> 01:45:17,811
You're chickenshit.

1689
01:45:17,884 --> 01:45:20,614
You're gonna use what happened today
as an excuse to give up.

1690
01:45:22,089 --> 01:45:23,681
It's over.

1691
01:45:23,757 --> 01:45:26,317
Why did you ask Jessup
for the transfer order?

1692
01:45:26,393 --> 01:45:29,021
- In Cuba. Why?
- What does it matter?

1693
01:45:29,096 --> 01:45:31,758
- I wanted the damn transfer order!
- Bullshit.

1694
01:45:31,832 --> 01:45:35,324
You could've gotten it by calling
any department at the Pentagon.

1695
01:45:35,402 --> 01:45:40,135
You didn't want the transfer order.
You wanted to see Jessup’s reaction.

1696
01:45:40,207 --> 01:45:43,267
You had an instinct,
and it was confirmed by Markinson.

1697
01:45:43,343 --> 01:45:46,278
Let's put Jessup on the stand
and end this thing!

1698
01:45:46,346 --> 01:45:50,510
What possible good could come
from putting Jessup on the stand?

1699
01:45:50,584 --> 01:45:52,711
He told Kendrick
to order the Code Red.

1700
01:45:52,786 --> 01:45:56,847
He did? That's great!
Why didn’t you say so?

1701
01:45:56,923 --> 01:45:59,187
And of course
you have proof of that!

1702
01:45:59,259 --> 01:46:03,491
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot. You were sick
the day they taught law at law school.

1703
01:46:03,563 --> 01:46:06,031
You put him on the stand,
and you get it from him.

1704
01:46:06,099 --> 01:46:10,126
Oh, we get it from him!
Yes! No problem!

1705
01:46:10,203 --> 01:46:14,037
Colonel Jessup, isn't it true that
you ordered the Code Red on Santiago?

1706
01:46:14,107 --> 01:46:17,235
- Listen, we're all a little-
- I'm sorry. Your time's run out.

1707
01:46:17,310 --> 01:46:20,404
What do we have for the losers?
Well, for our defendants...

1708
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:22,846
it's a lifetime
at exotic Fort Leavenworth.

1709
01:46:22,916 --> 01:46:25,885
And for Defense Counsel Kaffee...

1710
01:46:25,952 --> 01:46:27,749
it's a court-martial!

1711
01:46:27,821 --> 01:46:30,984
Yes, Johnny,
after falsely accusing...

1712
01:46:31,057 --> 01:46:33,389
a highly decorated Marine officer...

1713
01:46:33,460 --> 01:46:35,325
of conspiracy and perjury...

1714
01:46:35,395 --> 01:46:38,523
Lieutenant Kaffee will have
a long and prosperous career...

1715
01:46:38,598 --> 01:46:43,831
teaching typewriter maintenance
at the Rocco Clubo School for Women.

1716
01:46:43,904 --> 01:46:46,964
Thank you for playing
"Should we or should we not...

1717
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:50,100
follow the advice
of the galactically stupid?"

1718
01:47:11,965 --> 01:47:15,025
I'm sorry I lost
your set of steak knives.

1719
01:47:32,018 --> 01:47:33,952
Stop cleaning up.

1720
01:47:39,159 --> 01:47:41,093
Stop cleaning up.

1721
01:47:49,603 --> 01:47:52,538
- Want a drink?
- Yeah.

1722
01:48:10,557 --> 01:48:13,788
- Is your father proud of you?
- Don't do this to yourself.

1723
01:48:13,860 --> 01:48:15,589
I'll bet he is.

1724
01:48:16,396 --> 01:48:19,729
I'll bet he bores the shit
out of the neighbors and relatives.

1725
01:48:19,799 --> 01:48:24,259
"Sam's made Law Review.
He's got a big case he's making.

1726
01:48:24,337 --> 01:48:27,465
He's arguing.
He's making an argument. "

1727
01:48:32,979 --> 01:48:37,211
I think my father would’ve enjoyed
seeing me graduate from law school.

1728
01:48:40,720 --> 01:48:43,416
I think he would've liked that
an awful lot.

1729
01:48:45,992 --> 01:48:48,961
Did I ever tell you I wrote a paper
about your father in college?

1730
01:48:50,030 --> 01:48:51,463
Yeah?

1731
01:48:51,531 --> 01:48:54,125
One of the best
trial lawyers ever.

1732
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:57,533
Yes, he was.

1733
01:48:57,604 --> 01:48:59,902
If I were Dawson and Downey
and I had a choice...

1734
01:48:59,973 --> 01:49:02,942
between you or your father
to represent me in this case...

1735
01:49:03,009 --> 01:49:06,001
I'd choose you any day of the week
and twice on Sunday.

1736
01:49:06,079 --> 01:49:09,480
You should've seen yourself
thunder away at Kendrick.

1737
01:49:12,586 --> 01:49:14,520
Would you put Jessup on the stand?

1738
01:49:18,258 --> 01:49:22,718
- Do you think my father would have?
- With the evidence we got?

1739
01:49:22,796 --> 01:49:25,697
Not in a million years.

1740
01:49:25,765 --> 01:49:29,132
But here's the thing- and there's
really know way of getting around this-

1741
01:49:29,202 --> 01:49:33,536
Neither Lyle Kaffee nor Sam Weinberg
are lead counsel for the defense...

1742
01:49:33,607 --> 01:49:36,735
in the matter of
U.S. v. Dawson and Downey.

1743
01:49:36,810 --> 01:49:40,746
So there's really only one question-
What would you do?

1744
01:49:52,792 --> 01:49:56,853
Jo, get in the car.
Joanne, please get in the car.

1745
01:49:56,930 --> 01:49:58,363
Look-

1746
01:50:01,835 --> 01:50:06,169
I apologize. I was angry.
I'm sorry about what I said.

1747
01:50:06,239 --> 01:50:08,833
I'm gonna put Jessup on the stand.

1748
01:50:29,095 --> 01:50:30,756
What do you suggest we do?

1749
01:50:30,830 --> 01:50:33,025
I say we hit Jessup
with the phony transfer order.

1750
01:50:33,099 --> 01:50:35,033
What's a transfer order
without a witness?

1751
01:50:35,101 --> 01:50:36,693
- We have a witness.
- A dead witness.

1752
01:50:36,770 --> 01:50:39,671
In the hands of a lesser attorney,
that would be a problem.

1753
01:50:39,739 --> 01:50:42,207
Look at this. Last night
he's swimming in Jack Daniels...

1754
01:50:42,275 --> 01:50:45,005
and now he can leap tall buildings
in a single bound.

1755
01:50:45,078 --> 01:50:48,275
I'm getting my second wind.
Sit down, both of you.

1756
01:50:48,348 --> 01:50:52,876
Good. Jessup told Kendrick
to order the Code Red. Kendrick did.

1757
01:50:52,952 --> 01:50:55,182
Our clients followed the order.
The cover-up isn't our case.

1758
01:50:55,255 --> 01:50:59,885
To win, Jessup needs to tell the court
members that he ordered the Code Red.

1759
01:50:59,959 --> 01:51:03,690
- You think you can get him to say it?
- I think he wants to say it.

1760
01:51:03,763 --> 01:51:06,027
I think he's pissed off
that he's got to hide from us.

1761
01:51:06,099 --> 01:51:09,591
I think he wants to say that he made
a command decision, and that's the end.

1762
01:51:09,669 --> 01:51:12,604
He eats breakfast 300 yards away...

1763
01:51:12,672 --> 01:51:15,971
from 4,000 Cubans
that are trained to kill him.

1764
01:51:16,042 --> 01:51:18,101
No one's gonna tell him
how to run his unit.

1765
01:51:18,178 --> 01:51:21,045
Least of all the Harvard mouth
in his faggoty white uniform.

1766
01:51:21,114 --> 01:51:23,241
I need to shake him,
put him on the defensive...

1767
01:51:23,316 --> 01:51:26,012
and lead him right
where he's dying to go.

1768
01:51:26,086 --> 01:51:29,055
- That's it? That's the plan?
- That's the plan.

1769
01:51:29,122 --> 01:51:32,319
- How are you gonna do it?
- I have no idea.

1770
01:51:32,392 --> 01:51:34,519
- I need my bat.
- Your what?

1771
01:51:34,594 --> 01:51:36,858
I think better with my bat.
Where's my bat?

1772
01:51:36,930 --> 01:51:40,388
- I put it in the closet.
- You put it in the closet?

1773
01:51:40,467 --> 01:51:44,369
- I was tripping on it.
- Don't ever put that bat in the closet.

1774
01:51:44,437 --> 01:51:48,237
- He thinks better with his bat?
- I can understand that.

1775
01:51:59,686 --> 01:52:02,587
Stay here.
I'm going to the office for a while.

1776
01:52:05,125 --> 01:52:07,753
He does think better with that bat.

1777
01:52:30,250 --> 01:52:33,583
Sam, I need you
to do something for me.

1778
01:52:36,790 --> 01:52:40,021
- What's going on?
- Gotta go out to Andrews.

1779
01:53:03,883 --> 01:53:05,817
- Where's Sam?
- He's on his way.

1780
01:53:05,885 --> 01:53:07,819
- Did he get the guys?
- Yeah.

1781
01:53:07,887 --> 01:53:10,879
Listen, can I talk to you
for a second?

1782
01:53:10,957 --> 01:53:13,187
Oh, yeah, sure.

1783
01:53:23,636 --> 01:53:25,297
How you feeling?

1784
01:53:26,706 --> 01:53:30,267
Well, I think Jessup’s
gonna have his hands full today.

1785
01:53:33,012 --> 01:53:34,946
Listen, Danny...

1786
01:53:36,115 --> 01:53:38,549
when you're out there today...

1787
01:53:38,618 --> 01:53:41,781
if you feel like
it's not gonna happen...

1788
01:53:41,855 --> 01:53:44,983
if you feel like
he's not gonna say it...

1789
01:53:45,058 --> 01:53:46,650
don't go for it.

1790
01:53:48,161 --> 01:53:50,391
You could get in trouble.

1791
01:53:50,463 --> 01:53:52,556
I'm special counsel
for Internal Affairs...

1792
01:53:52,632 --> 01:53:55,192
and I'm telling you
you could get in a lot of trouble.

1793
01:53:55,268 --> 01:53:57,259
Wait, Lieutenant Commander Galloway...

1794
01:53:57,337 --> 01:54:01,569
you're not suggesting
that I back off a material witness?

1795
01:54:01,641 --> 01:54:04,838
If you think you can't get him, yeah.

1796
01:54:07,080 --> 01:54:08,741
All rise.

1797
01:54:13,586 --> 01:54:16,578
- Where's Sam?
- He's on his way.

1798
01:54:22,195 --> 01:54:24,789
- Call your first witness.
- Where is he?

1799
01:54:24,864 --> 01:54:27,196
- He'll be here.
- Lieutenant.

1800
01:54:27,267 --> 01:54:28,928
Call your witness.

1801
01:54:35,608 --> 01:54:38,270
Defense calls Colonel Nathan Jessup.

1802
01:54:55,061 --> 01:54:57,894
Colonel Jessup, would you raise
your right hand please, sir?

1803
01:54:57,964 --> 01:55:01,422
Do you solemnly swear that the testimony
you will give in this court-martial...

1804
01:55:01,501 --> 01:55:04,937
will be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

1805
01:55:05,004 --> 01:55:06,403
Yes, I do.

1806
01:55:06,472 --> 01:55:07,939
Have a seat please, sir.

1807
01:55:09,575 --> 01:55:13,033
Would you state your name, rank
and current billet for the record, sir?

1808
01:55:13,112 --> 01:55:16,240
Colonel Nathan R. Jessup,
commanding officer...

1809
01:55:16,316 --> 01:55:19,615
Marine Ground Forces,
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

1810
01:55:19,686 --> 01:55:22,018
- Thank you, sir.
- He's not here.

1811
01:55:27,827 --> 01:55:31,388
Colonel, when you learned
of Santiago’s letter to the N.I.S...

1812
01:55:31,464 --> 01:55:34,592
you had a meeting
with your two senior officers.

1813
01:55:34,667 --> 01:55:36,726
- Is that right?
- Yes.

1814
01:55:36,803 --> 01:55:40,398
The platoon commander,
Lieutenant Jonathan Kendrick...

1815
01:55:40,473 --> 01:55:44,136
and the executive officer,
Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Markinson.

1816
01:55:44,210 --> 01:55:45,734
Yes.

1817
01:55:45,812 --> 01:55:50,306
And at present Colonel Markinson
is dead. Is that right?

1818
01:55:50,383 --> 01:55:54,444
Objection. I'd like to know just what
the defense counsel is implying.

1819
01:55:54,520 --> 01:55:57,956
I'm implying simply that at present
Colonel Markinson is not alive.

1820
01:55:58,024 --> 01:56:01,755
Colonel Jessup doesn't need to appear
in court to confirm that information.

1821
01:56:01,828 --> 01:56:04,262
I just wasn't sure the witness was aware
that two days ago...

1822
01:56:04,330 --> 01:56:07,128
the colonel took his own life
with a .45-caliber pistol.

1823
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:09,668
The witness is aware,
the court is aware...

1824
01:56:09,736 --> 01:56:11,670
and now the court members
are aware.

1825
01:56:11,738 --> 01:56:15,299
We thank you for bringing this
to our attention.

1826
01:56:15,375 --> 01:56:17,104
Move on, Lieutenant..

1827
01:56:17,176 --> 01:56:18,939
Yes, sir.

1828
01:56:19,012 --> 01:56:22,641
Colonel, you gave Lieutenant Kendrick
an order at this meeting, right?

1829
01:56:22,715 --> 01:56:27,049
I told Kendrick to tell his men
that Santiago wasn't to be touched.

1830
01:56:27,120 --> 01:56:30,055
And did you give an order
to Colonel Markinson as well?

1831
01:56:30,123 --> 01:56:35,652
I ordered Markinson to have Santiago
transferred off the base immediately.

1832
01:56:35,728 --> 01:56:37,525
Why?

1833
01:56:37,597 --> 01:56:41,363
I felt his life might be in danger
once word of the letter got out.

1834
01:56:41,434 --> 01:56:42,867
Grave danger?

1835
01:56:42,935 --> 01:56:45,130
Is there another kind?

1836
01:56:48,741 --> 01:56:52,677
Colonel, we have the transfer order
that you and Markinson co-signed...

1837
01:56:52,745 --> 01:56:57,375
ordering that Santiago be on a flight
leaving Guantanamo at 6:00 the next morning.

1838
01:56:57,450 --> 01:57:02,547
- Was that the first flight?
- The 0600 was the first flight.

1839
01:57:06,426 --> 01:57:09,793
You flew up to Washington this morning.
Is that right?

1840
01:57:09,862 --> 01:57:13,263
I notice you’re wearing your
class "A" dress uniform in court today.

1841
01:57:13,332 --> 01:57:16,529
- As are you, Lieutenant.
- Did you wear that on the plane?

1842
01:57:16,602 --> 01:57:19,400
Please the court, is this dialogue
relevant to anything-

1843
01:57:19,472 --> 01:57:22,168
Defense didn't have the opportunity
to depose this witness.

1844
01:57:22,241 --> 01:57:25,938
- I'd ask for a little latitude.
- A very little latitude.

1845
01:57:28,181 --> 01:57:30,206
I wore utilities on the plane.

1846
01:57:30,283 --> 01:57:33,343
- You brought your dress uniform?
- Yes.

1847
01:57:33,419 --> 01:57:36,820
- Toothbrush, shaving kit, underwear?
- Your Honor!

1848
01:57:36,889 --> 01:57:39,255
Is the colonel's underwear
a matter of national security?

1849
01:57:39,325 --> 01:57:42,726
Gentlemen! You better get somewhere
fast with this, Lieutenant.

1850
01:57:42,795 --> 01:57:44,854
Yes, sir. Colonel?

1851
01:57:45,965 --> 01:57:49,696
I brought a change of clothes
and some personal items.

1852
01:57:49,769 --> 01:57:51,634
Thank you.

1853
01:57:51,704 --> 01:57:55,367
After Dawson and Downey's arrest
on the night of the sixth...

1854
01:57:55,441 --> 01:57:59,707
Santiago's barracks were sealed off
and its contents inventoried.

1855
01:57:59,779 --> 01:58:03,078
" Four pairs camouflage pants,
three long-sleeve khaki shirts...

1856
01:58:03,149 --> 01:58:07,051
three pairs of boots, four pairs
green socks, three green T-shirts-"

1857
01:58:07,120 --> 01:58:10,055
Please the court, is there a question
anywhere in our future?

1858
01:58:10,123 --> 01:58:13,251
Lieutenant Kaffee, I have to ask you
to state your question.

1859
01:58:13,326 --> 01:58:16,124
I'm wondering why Santiago
wasn't packed.

1860
01:58:18,197 --> 01:58:21,462
I'll tell you what.
We'll get back to that one in a minute.

1861
01:58:22,368 --> 01:58:25,701
This is a record of all phone calls made
from your base in the past 24 hours.

1862
01:58:25,771 --> 01:58:29,366
After being subpoenaed to Washington,
you made three calls.

1863
01:58:29,442 --> 01:58:31,774
Do you recognize
those number, sir?

1864
01:58:31,844 --> 01:58:34,972
I called Colonel Fitzhughes
in Quantico, Virginia.

1865
01:58:35,047 --> 01:58:37,845
I wanted to let him know
that I would be in town.

1866
01:58:37,917 --> 01:58:41,478
The second call was to arrange a meeting
with Congressman Richmond...

1867
01:58:41,554 --> 01:58:43,818
of the House Armed Services Committee.

1868
01:58:43,890 --> 01:58:46,950
And the third call
was to my sister Elizabeth.

1869
01:58:47,026 --> 01:58:49,119
Why did you make that call, sir?

1870
01:58:49,195 --> 01:58:52,596
I thought she might like
to have dinner tonight.

1871
01:58:52,665 --> 01:58:56,032
- I'm gonna stop this.
- These are phone records from Gitmo...

1872
01:58:56,102 --> 01:59:00,334
for September 6,
and these are 14 letters...

1873
01:59:00,406 --> 01:59:03,136
that Santiago wrote in nine months...

1874
01:59:03,209 --> 01:59:06,372
requesting- in fact, begging-
for a transfer.

1875
01:59:06,445 --> 01:59:09,642
Upon hearing the news that
he was finally getting his transfer...

1876
01:59:09,715 --> 01:59:13,674
Santiago was so excited that
do you know how many people he called?

1877
01:59:13,753 --> 01:59:16,221
Zero. Nobody.

1878
01:59:16,289 --> 01:59:20,157
Not one call to his parents
saying he was coming home.

1879
01:59:20,226 --> 01:59:23,457
Not one call to a friend, saying,
"Can you pick me up at the airport?"

1880
01:59:23,529 --> 01:59:27,363
He was asleep in his bed at midnight,
and according to you...

1881
01:59:27,433 --> 01:59:29,958
he was getting on a plane
in six hours.

1882
01:59:30,036 --> 01:59:33,597
Yet everything he owned
was hanging neatly in his closet...

1883
01:59:33,673 --> 01:59:36,301
and folded neatly in his footlocker.

1884
01:59:36,375 --> 01:59:40,141
You were leaving for one day.
You packed a bag and made three calls.

1885
01:59:40,213 --> 01:59:44,547
Santiago was leaving
for the rest of his life...

1886
01:59:46,319 --> 01:59:49,083
and he hadn't called a soul...

1887
01:59:49,155 --> 01:59:51,817
and he hadn't packed a thing.

1888
01:59:55,061 --> 01:59:56,824
Can you explain that?

1889
01:59:59,332 --> 02:00:01,596
The fact is,
there was no transfer order.

1890
02:00:01,667 --> 02:00:04,431
Santiago wasn't going anywhere.
Isn't that right, Colonel?

1891
02:00:04,503 --> 02:00:07,961
Objection. Your Honor, it's obvious
that Lieutenant Kaffee's intention...

1892
02:00:08,040 --> 02:00:10,372
is the smear
a high-ranking Marine officer...

1893
02:00:10,443 --> 02:00:14,106
in the hope that the mere appearance
of impropriety will win him points.

1894
02:00:14,180 --> 02:00:18,116
It's my recommendation, sir,
that Lieutenant Kaffee be reprimanded...

1895
02:00:18,184 --> 02:00:21,085
and the witness be excused
with the court's deepest apologies.

1896
02:00:22,922 --> 02:00:26,016
Overruled.
Your objection is noted.

1897
02:00:32,465 --> 02:00:34,296
Is this funny, sir?

1898
02:00:34,367 --> 02:00:37,700
No, it's not.
It's tragic.

1899
02:00:37,770 --> 02:00:40,466
- Do you have an answer?
- Absolutely.

1900
02:00:40,539 --> 02:00:44,339
My answer is,
I don't have the first damn clue.

1901
02:00:44,410 --> 02:00:48,176
Maybe he was an early riser
and liked to pack in the morning.

1902
02:00:48,247 --> 02:00:51,080
And maybe he didn't have any friends.

1903
02:00:51,150 --> 02:00:54,642
I'm an educated man, but I'm afraid
I can't speak intelligently...

1904
02:00:54,720 --> 02:00:58,383
about the travel habits
of William Santiago.

1905
02:00:58,457 --> 02:01:03,485
What I do know is that he was set
to leave the base at 0600.

1906
02:01:04,363 --> 02:01:09,460
Now, are these really the questions
that I was called here to answer?

1907
02:01:09,535 --> 02:01:11,901
Phone calls and footlockers?

1908
02:01:11,971 --> 02:01:15,668
Please tell me that you have
something more, Lieutenant.

1909
02:01:15,741 --> 02:01:19,507
These two Marines
are on trial for their lives.

1910
02:01:19,578 --> 02:01:24,015
Please tell me that their lawyer hasn't
pinned their hopes to a phone bill.

1911
02:01:26,519 --> 02:01:29,955
Do you have any other questions
for me, counselor?

1912
02:01:48,708 --> 02:01:52,235
Lieutenant, do you have anything
further for this witness?

1913
02:01:59,752 --> 02:02:02,016
Thanks, Danny.
I love Washington.

1914
02:02:02,088 --> 02:02:04,682
Excuse me.
I didn't dismiss you.

1915
02:02:05,758 --> 02:02:07,521
I beg your pardon?

1916
02:02:07,593 --> 02:02:12,121
I'm not through with my examination.
Sit down.

1917
02:02:13,833 --> 02:02:16,597
- Colonel.
- What's that?

1918
02:02:16,669 --> 02:02:19,331
I'd appreciate it if you’d address me
as "colonel" or "sir. "

1919
02:02:19,405 --> 02:02:20,997
I believe I've earned it.

1920
02:02:21,073 --> 02:02:25,305
Defense counsel will address
the witness as "colonel" or "sir. "

1921
02:02:25,378 --> 02:02:28,347
I don't know what the hell
kind of unit you're running here.

1922
02:02:28,414 --> 02:02:32,214
The witness will address this court
as "judge" or "your honor. "

1923
02:02:32,284 --> 02:02:37,017
I'm quite certain I've earned it.
Take your seat, Colonel.

1924
02:02:41,994 --> 02:02:46,090
What do you want to discuss now?
My favorite color?

1925
02:02:47,366 --> 02:02:50,062
Colonel, the 6:00 a. m. flight
was the first one off the base?

1926
02:02:50,136 --> 02:02:51,194
Yes.

1927
02:02:51,270 --> 02:02:53,329
There wasn't a flight
that left seven hours earlier...

1928
02:02:53,406 --> 02:02:55,738
and landed at Andrews Air Force Base
at 2:00 a. m.?

1929
02:02:55,808 --> 02:02:58,777
Lieutenant, I think
we've covered this, haven't we?

1930
02:02:59,812 --> 02:03:01,939
Your Honor, these are
the tower chief’s logs...

1931
02:03:02,014 --> 02:03:04,847
for both Guantanamo Bay
and Andrews Air Force Base.

1932
02:03:04,917 --> 02:03:08,284
The Guantanamo log lists no flight
that left at 11:00 p. m.

1933
02:03:08,354 --> 02:03:10,948
The Andrews log lists no flight
that landed at 2:00 a. m.

1934
02:03:11,023 --> 02:03:13,617
I'd like to admit them
as defense exhibits Alpha and Bravo.

1935
02:03:14,393 --> 02:03:17,920
I don't understand. You're admitting
evidence of a flight that never existed.

1936
02:03:17,997 --> 02:03:20,465
We believe it did, sir.

1937
02:03:20,533 --> 02:03:23,832
Defense will be calling Airmen
Cecil O'Malley and Anthony Rodriguez.

1938
02:03:23,903 --> 02:03:26,929
They were working the ground crew
at Andrews at 2:00 a. m. on the 7th.

1939
02:03:27,006 --> 02:03:29,839
- These men weren't on the list.
- Rebuttal witnesses, Your Honor...

1940
02:03:29,909 --> 02:03:34,243
called specifically to refute testimony
offered under direct examination.

1941
02:03:34,313 --> 02:03:37,282
- I'll allow the witnesses.
- This is ridiculous.

1942
02:03:37,349 --> 02:03:41,752
- Colonel, a moment ago-
- Check the tower logs, for Christ's sake!

1943
02:03:42,721 --> 02:03:44,916
We'll get to the airmen
in just a minute, sir.

1944
02:03:45,958 --> 02:03:47,892
A moment ago you said that
you ordered Lieutenant Kendrick...

1945
02:03:47,960 --> 02:03:51,987
to tell his men
that Santiago wasn't to be touched.

1946
02:03:52,064 --> 02:03:53,622
That's right.

1947
02:03:53,699 --> 02:03:56,429
And Lieutenant Kendrick was clear
on what you wanted?

1948
02:03:56,502 --> 02:03:58,299
Crystal.

1949
02:03:58,370 --> 02:04:01,498
Any chance Lieutenant Kendrick
ignored the order?

1950
02:04:01,574 --> 02:04:03,565
Ignored the order?

1951
02:04:03,642 --> 02:04:06,736
Any chance he forgot about it?

1952
02:04:06,812 --> 02:04:10,942
Any chance Lieutenant Kendrick left your
office and said, "The old man is wrong"?

1953
02:04:12,985 --> 02:04:15,249
When Lieutenant Kendrick
spoke to the platoon...

1954
02:04:15,321 --> 02:04:18,586
and ordered them not to touch Santiago,
any chance they ignored him?

1955
02:04:20,025 --> 02:04:23,017
You ever served
in an infantry unit, son?

1956
02:04:23,095 --> 02:04:26,394
- No, sir.
- Ever served in a forward area?

1957
02:04:27,733 --> 02:04:30,759
Ever put your life
in another man's hands?

1958
02:04:30,836 --> 02:04:33,464
Asked him to put his life in yours?

1959
02:04:34,740 --> 02:04:36,708
We follow orders, son.

1960
02:04:36,775 --> 02:04:39,744
We follow orders, or people die.

1961
02:04:39,812 --> 02:04:42,975
It's that simple.
Are we clear?

1962
02:04:43,048 --> 02:04:44,879
Yes, sir.

1963
02:04:44,950 --> 02:04:46,679
Are we clear?

1964
02:04:46,752 --> 02:04:48,686
Crystal.

1965
02:04:50,823 --> 02:04:55,385
I have just one more question before
I call Airmen O'Malley and Rodriguez.

1966
02:04:56,729 --> 02:05:00,995
If you gave an order
that Santiago wasn't to be touched...

1967
02:05:01,066 --> 02:05:03,591
and your orders
are always followed...

1968
02:05:05,571 --> 02:05:08,665
then why would Santiago
be in danger?

1969
02:05:10,576 --> 02:05:14,307
Why would it be necessary
to transfer him off the base?

1970
02:05:19,919 --> 02:05:23,047
Santiago was a substandard Marine.

1971
02:05:23,122 --> 02:05:25,522
- He was being transferred-
- That's not what you said!

1972
02:05:25,591 --> 02:05:29,220
You said he was being transferred
because he was in grave danger.

1973
02:05:29,295 --> 02:05:32,230
I said, "Grave danger?"
You said, "Is there any other kind?"

1974
02:05:32,298 --> 02:05:34,823
- I recall what I said.
- I can have it read back to you.

1975
02:05:34,900 --> 02:05:37,892
I know what I said!
I don't have to have it read back to me.

1976
02:05:37,970 --> 02:05:41,565
Then why the two orders?
Colonel?

1977
02:05:43,509 --> 02:05:46,205
Sometimes men take matters
into their own hands.

1978
02:05:46,278 --> 02:05:49,372
You've made it clear that your men
never take matters into their own hands.

1979
02:05:49,448 --> 02:05:51,416
Your men follow orders,
or people die.

1980
02:05:51,483 --> 02:05:54,111
So Santiago should have been
in danger, should he?

1981
02:05:54,186 --> 02:05:58,054
- You snotty little bastard.
- I'd like to ask for a recess.

1982
02:05:58,123 --> 02:06:01,752
- I'd like an answer to the question.
- The court will wait for an answer.

1983
02:06:02,595 --> 02:06:04,927
If Lieutenant Kendrick
gave an order...

1984
02:06:04,997 --> 02:06:07,966
that Santiago
wasn't to be touched...

1985
02:06:08,033 --> 02:06:09,967
then why did he
have to be transferred?

1986
02:06:12,871 --> 02:06:17,069
Lieutenant Kendrick ordered the Code Red
because that's what you told him to do!

1987
02:06:17,142 --> 02:06:20,134
- Object!
- And then you cut these guys loose!

1988
02:06:20,212 --> 02:06:23,773
- I'll hold you in contempt.
- You doctored the logbook!

1989
02:06:23,849 --> 02:06:26,716
- Damn it, Kaffee!
- Consider yourself in contempt.

1990
02:06:26,785 --> 02:06:29,583
Colonel Jessup,
did you order the Code Red?

1991
02:06:29,655 --> 02:06:33,216
- You don't have to answer that.
- I'll answer the question.

1992
02:06:33,292 --> 02:06:35,317
- You want answers?
- I think I'm entitled!

1993
02:06:35,394 --> 02:06:37,794
- You want answers?
- I want the truth!

1994
02:06:37,863 --> 02:06:40,957
You can't handle the truth!

1995
02:06:41,033 --> 02:06:43,024
Son, we live in a world
that has walls...

1996
02:06:43,102 --> 02:06:45,730
and those walls have to be guarded
by men with guns.

1997
02:06:45,804 --> 02:06:50,173
Who's gonna do it? You?
You, Lieutenant Weinberg?

1998
02:06:50,242 --> 02:06:54,235
I have a greater responsibility
than you can possibly fathom.

1999
02:06:54,313 --> 02:06:57,771
You weep for Santiago,
and you curse the Marines.

2000
02:06:57,850 --> 02:07:01,684
You have the luxury
of not knowing what I know-

2001
02:07:01,754 --> 02:07:05,850
that Santiago's death,
while tragic, probably saved lives.

2002
02:07:05,924 --> 02:07:11,829
And my existence, while grotesque and
incomprehensible to you, saves lives!

2003
02:07:11,897 --> 02:07:16,027
You don't want the truth because
deep down you don't talk about...

2004
02:07:16,101 --> 02:07:18,262
you want me on that wall.

2005
02:07:18,337 --> 02:07:21,033
You need me on that wall!

2006
02:07:21,106 --> 02:07:25,770
We use words
like honor, code, loyalty.

2007
02:07:25,844 --> 02:07:29,541
We use these words as the backbone
of a life spent defending something.

2008
02:07:29,615 --> 02:07:31,606
You use them as a punch line.

2009
02:07:31,684 --> 02:07:35,518
I have neither the time
nor the inclination to explain myself...

2010
02:07:35,587 --> 02:07:39,751
to a man who rises and sleeps under
the blanket of the freedom I provide...

2011
02:07:39,825 --> 02:07:42,692
and then questions the manner
in which I provide it!

2012
02:07:42,761 --> 02:07:46,026
I would rather you just said thank you
and went on your way.

2013
02:07:46,098 --> 02:07:49,864
Otherwise, I suggest you
pick up a weapon and stand a post.

2014
02:07:49,935 --> 02:07:54,838
Either way, I don't give a damn
what you think you are entitled to!

2015
02:07:54,907 --> 02:07:56,568
Did you order the Code Red?

2016
02:07:56,642 --> 02:07:58,576
- I did the job-
- Did you order the Code Red?

2017
02:07:58,644 --> 02:08:00,976
You're goddamned right I did!

2018
02:08:12,024 --> 02:08:15,118
Please the court,
I suggest the members be dismissed...

2019
02:08:15,194 --> 02:08:18,425
so that we can move to an immediate
Article 39-A session.

2020
02:08:18,497 --> 02:08:20,931
The witness has rights.

2021
02:08:20,999 --> 02:08:23,229
Captain Ross?

2022
02:08:34,113 --> 02:08:37,776
The members of the court will retire
to an anteroom until further instructed.

2023
02:08:37,850 --> 02:08:39,647
All rise.

2024
02:08:40,886 --> 02:08:44,378
What the hell is this?
Colonel, what's going on?

2025
02:08:44,456 --> 02:08:46,981
I did my job.
I'd do it again.

2026
02:08:47,059 --> 02:08:50,187
I'm gonna get on a plane
and go on back to my base.

2027
02:08:50,262 --> 02:08:53,959
You're not going anywhere, Colonel.
M.P.s, guard the colonel.

2028
02:08:54,032 --> 02:08:55,465
Yes, sir.

2029
02:08:57,503 --> 02:09:00,028
- Captain Ross.
- What the hell is this?

2030
02:09:00,105 --> 02:09:03,006
Colonel Jessup, you have
the right to remain silent.

2031
02:09:03,075 --> 02:09:07,705
I'm being charged with a crime?
Is that what this is?

2032
02:09:07,780 --> 02:09:11,113
- I'm being charged with a crime?
- You have a right to consult a lawyer.

2033
02:09:11,183 --> 02:09:15,017
- This is funny. That's what this is.
- This lawyer may be appointed by you.

2034
02:09:15,087 --> 02:09:18,784
I'm gonna rip the eyes out of your head
and piss in your dead skull!

2035
02:09:18,857 --> 02:09:20,791
You fucked with the wrong Marine!

2036
02:09:20,859 --> 02:09:24,260
Colonel Jessup, do you understand
these rights as I have just read them?

2037
02:09:30,502 --> 02:09:33,266
You fucking people.

2038
02:09:33,338 --> 02:09:36,102
You have no idea
how to defend a nation.

2039
02:09:36,175 --> 02:09:39,611
All you did was weaken
a country today, Kaffee.

2040
02:09:39,678 --> 02:09:41,669
That's all you did.

2041
02:09:41,747 --> 02:09:46,844
You put people's lives in danger.
Sweet dreams, son.

2042
02:09:46,919 --> 02:09:49,080
Don't call me son.

2043
02:09:49,154 --> 02:09:53,591
I'm a lawyer and an officer
in the United States Navy...

2044
02:09:53,659 --> 02:09:56,423
and you're under arrest,
you son of a bitch.

2045
02:10:00,732 --> 02:10:02,700
The witness is excused.

2046
02:10:24,823 --> 02:10:25,881
All rise.

2047
02:10:37,402 --> 02:10:39,029
Have the members reached a verdict?

2048
02:10:39,104 --> 02:10:41,038
We have, sir.

2049
02:10:52,851 --> 02:10:56,309
Lance Corporal Dawson
and Private First Class Downey.

2050
02:10:59,691 --> 02:11:03,855
On the charge of murder,
the members find the accused...

2051
02:11:03,929 --> 02:11:05,863
not guilty.

2052
02:11:06,932 --> 02:11:10,527
On the charge
of conspiracy to commit murder...

2053
02:11:10,602 --> 02:11:14,368
the members find the accused
not guilty.

2054
02:11:17,175 --> 02:11:21,009
On the charge of conduct
unbecoming a United States Marine...

2055
02:11:21,079 --> 02:11:26,881
the members find the accused
guilty as charged.

2056
02:11:28,854 --> 02:11:32,017
The accused are hereby sentenced
to time already served...

2057
02:11:32,090 --> 02:11:36,959
and you are ordered to be dishonorably
discharged from the Marine Corps.

2058
02:11:38,363 --> 02:11:40,456
This court-martial is adjourned.

2059
02:11:40,532 --> 02:11:42,432
All rise.

2060
02:11:58,250 --> 02:12:00,218
What does that mean?

2061
02:12:02,219 --> 02:12:03,219
Hal?

2062
02:12:05,390 --> 02:12:07,324
What did that mean?

2063
02:12:10,629 --> 02:12:14,827
I don't understand. Colonel Jessup
said he ordered the Code Red.

2064
02:12:14,900 --> 02:12:18,836
- I know.
- What did we do wrong?

2065
02:12:18,904 --> 02:12:22,431
- It's not that simple.
- We did nothing wrong!

2066
02:12:22,507 --> 02:12:23,906
Yeah, we did.

2067
02:12:27,045 --> 02:12:30,947
We were supposed to fight for people
who couldn't fight for themselves.

2068
02:12:32,084 --> 02:12:34,780
We were supposed
to fight for Willie.

2069
02:12:42,561 --> 02:12:45,587
I have to take these men
over to personnel for some paperwork.

2070
02:13:03,949 --> 02:13:06,645
You don't need to wear a patch
on your arm to have honor.

2071
02:13:13,258 --> 02:13:16,352
There's an officer on deck.

2072
02:13:40,252 --> 02:13:42,516
Airmen Cecil O'Malley
and Anthony Rodriguez-

2073
02:13:42,587 --> 02:13:45,420
What exactly were these guys
gonna testify to?

2074
02:13:45,490 --> 02:13:47,685
Unless I'm mistaken, they were both
gonna testify under oath...

2075
02:13:47,759 --> 02:13:50,751
that they had absolutely
no recollection of anything.

2076
02:13:50,829 --> 02:13:54,094
- Strong witnesses.
- And handsome too, don’t you think?

2077
02:13:55,667 --> 02:13:58,329
I'll see you around campus.
I gotta go arrest Kendrick.

2078
02:13:58,403 --> 02:14:01,031
Tell him I say hi.

2079
02:14:01,106 --> 02:14:02,698
Will do.
