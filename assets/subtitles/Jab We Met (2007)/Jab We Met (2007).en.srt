Adi.. - Although going to the
court is beneficial to her..

2
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,351
In just 4 hearings the matter
will become clear..

3
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,686
And she will know what she
genuinely deserves..

4
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:33,486
..and what she should expect
from this company!

5
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,154
Look, I don't think we should
jump to any conclusions!

6
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:38,493
We are meeting here because we are
considering Mrs. Khanna's demands.

7
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,294
Consider? Who gave you
the authority to..

8
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:07,384
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, sir.

9
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:08,585
- Good morning, sir.

10
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,239
Hello, Mr. Kashyap.
Nice meeting you.

11
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:01,780
Sir. Photographs please

12
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:02,906
Congratulations!

13
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,993
Passengers, attention please,
this is the train..

14
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:43,008
..boarding to delhi
from Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus..

15
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:46,739
..from platform no.5 at 5..05.

16
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:49,748
Hey, hurry up.

17
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:00,357
Mister, hold this luggage!
- Let me get in!

18
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:01,893
Give it! Give it!

19
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:03,019
Give it to that gentlemen!

20
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:04,427
Ma'am, you quickly get in!

21
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:05,896
You don't worry about me!

22
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:07,364
Just load the luggage inside!
Quickly! Here!

23
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:08,491
Ma'am, I told you in the
beginning itself..

24
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:09,967
..you have luggage enough
for two coolie's!

25
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,099
Here.. Hold the frame carefully!
Its Babajii's frame!

26
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,430
Is there more luggage?

27
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,440
Don't worry! No matter how much
more luggage there is. Let it come.

28
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:16,566
Here!
- Here! Here! Hold this!

29
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:17,700
This is really risky!

30
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:20,708
Ma'am, you please look ahead!
- Yes, I am!

31
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,974
You just quickly load the luggage!

32
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,387
Come on! Come on! - Give me
your hand! Give me your hand!

33
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:30,513
Come on!

34
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,648
Oh God!

35
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:36,917
This was the limit, l
crossed the line today!

36
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:39,856
Do you know what?

37
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,459
Till date I have not missed
a single train!

38
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:47,466
Thank you, Babajj! You saved
me from breaking my record!

39
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,936
I am inside now.
- Yes

40
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,470
.. You can leave my hand now..

41
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,676
I am not that beautiful!

42
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,817
I prefer travelling in
a Non-AC compartment.

43
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:02,480
But my family.. they
say 'you are a girl!'

44
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,420
As if I don't know that I am a girl!

45
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,017
Mister, is this A1?
- Yes!

46
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,485
Thank you!

47
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:11,029
Now what is the connection
between AC and a girl?

48
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,489
I don't understand that!

49
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,629
I am not travelling alone
for the first time!

50
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,503
That too in this train! This
is like my second home!

51
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:26,502
17, 18,..here it is

52
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:30,707
Please show me your ticket.

53
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:34,850
Hello! I am talking to you!

54
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:40,520
Hey! This is my seat. 23!

55
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,452
Strange. Hey, mister!

56
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:48,796
This seat is mine! 23!

57
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:57,201
Nobody likes to take
the passage seat

58
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,674
But I always insist
on the passage seat.

59
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:03,541
The reservation uncle gets
very alarmed and worried

60
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:07,617
But my logic is that.. my journey
doesn't end with this train!

61
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:09,611
I am going to Bhatinda.

62
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,014
My house is there.
My family is there.

63
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:13,888
Everybody has a family.
I have one too.

64
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:15,890
Everybody says that Mumbai
is a crowded city.

65
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:17,486
What do you mean by crowded?

66
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:19,030
People like us form the crowd!

67
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,558
They are a part of the crowd!
Still they crib!

68
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:24,034
I am leaving Mumbai! Forever!

69
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:25,896
Do you know when I came here?

70
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:27,505
When Mumbai was Bombay!

71
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:28,699
Hostel! Hostel! Hostel!

72
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,705
St Teresa's boarding school
hostel in Shimla!

73
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:33,040
Missionary hostel for college
girls in Bombay Central!

74
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:35,706
I swear! Henceforth I will never
live in a hostel again!

75
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:38,913
I hope the road digging
stops before the monsoon.

76
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:40,177
Otherwise do you know
what will happen?

77
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,714
Anyway! What happened?

78
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:17,814
What are you doing?!

79
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,286
..Iast time a kid fell and died..

80
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,620
It's really dangerous!

81
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,628
Are you dumb? You can't talk?

82
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,630
Or are you shy?

83
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:35,300
Or are you just insolent?

84
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:40,169
Something is surely the matter!

85
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,180
I have asked three times..but
still no answer!

86
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,308
Ticket please!

87
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,984
It's on the berth! I will
just give it to you!

88
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:49,718
Excuse me, mister! Ticket please!

89
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:53,121
Hello, mister! First
come inside! Come on!

90
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,655
Show me your ticket!

91
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:04,191
He wants to see your ticket. Ticket!

92
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:07,336
Where is your ticket?
- I don't have a ticket.

93
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,599
Actually you see what
happened is that..

94
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:12,610
..his plan was made at
the very last minute.

95
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,674
So there was no time
to buy a ticket.

96
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,809
By the way the train
is quite empty..

97
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:18,677
So you can give him a ticket now.

98
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,677
There is no problem, right?

99
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,283
Mister! Are you convinced
or shall I say more?

100
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:28,084
Ticket for where?

101
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,088
Hello!

102
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:35,825
Where is this train going?
- What?

103
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:43,037
Last stop. Delhi. Give
him a ticket to Delhi.

104
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:48,774
Look. I might as well tell you.
A tragedy has occurred with him.

105
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:51,240
He is going through bad times.

106
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:55,646
So that's why he.. Delhi!

107
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:04,657
Oh Mister! What's the matter?

108
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,192
Are you doing drugs?

109
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:12,267
Look, if there is any problem,
then you can tell me.

110
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,264
I don't mind! Tell me!

111
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,939
All my friends tell
me their problems!

112
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:19,676
And I solve it!

113
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:21,736
Do you know? I am that
kind of a girl!

114
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,278
Like an agony aunt whose articles
you find in the magazines?

115
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,742
I'm just like that!

116
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:26,943
Tell me! What's the matter?

117
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,077
Tell me what is your problem?

118
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,155
Tell me! Don't feel shy! What
is your problem? Tell me!

119
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,415
You are my problem!

120
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,091
You are talking non-stop!

121
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,685
Don't you understand that I am not
interested in talking to you?

122
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:37,888
I don't want to talk to you!

123
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:41,228
I don't want to know whether you
are going to Bhatinda or Benaras!

124
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,029
Whether you lived in some
hostel or some brothel!

125
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:44,364
I just don't care! All right!

126
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:47,304
So just please! Please! Leave
me alone! All right!

127
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,249
That thing about brothel
was not right!

128
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:03,311
Yeah! I.. Iook.. I..

129
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,851
I know! You are clearly very
upset about something!

130
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:08,851
That's why you got
upset with me too!

131
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,119
And you started talking nonsense!

132
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,324
But it's okay! I don't feel bad!

133
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,391
Actually nowadays I don't
feel bad about anything!

134
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,794
Do you know why?

135
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,134
Because I am going to
get married! Very soon!

136
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,273
Listen! I am eloping!

137
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,807
The guy is not Sikh so
my family won't agree!

138
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,741
But what can anybody do
after the marriage?

139
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:28,473
We will go and fall at their feet!

140
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:29,872
They will have to forgive us!

141
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,814
I like mountains a lot! Really!

142
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:35,149
Since childhood I had this
craze for marriage! By God!

143
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:37,018
What is the difference between
hill and mountain?

144
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,488
I could never understand.

145
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,283
I was just waiting for my
college to get over..

146
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,884
And his travel agency to open up!

147
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:49,759
But you don't find good
shoes there. That's why..

148
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:20,056
Hang on!

149
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,129
Hey! The train is leaving!

150
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,402
Listen! Hero!
- What's his name?

151
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,331
Hey, mister!
- His name is mister!

152
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:31,069
Look here!
- Is he with you?

153
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,542
Oh God!
- Listen!

154
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:35,404
Listen!

155
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:38,140
Where are you going, ma'am?
The train is leaving!

156
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:39,411
The train is leaving!
- Ma'am!

157
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,211
Ma'am!

158
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:45,014
Ma'am!

159
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:46,418
Hey, black pant!
- Ma'am!

160
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:51,890
Hey, Mumbai guy! Listen!
The train is leaving!

161
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:53,356
Hello!

162
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:59,303
Are you mad? The train
is leaving! Come on!

163
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:02,899
What?

164
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,034
Go to hell!

165
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:14,515
Ma'am, what have you done?

166
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,845
Where are you running away?

167
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:18,389
Who will pay the compensation?

168
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:19,856
Leave me! The train is leaving!

169
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,920
Stop! Somebody pull the chain!

170
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:25,389
Stop!

171
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,264
Such a fat woman!

172
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,605
Even a blind man could
see such a big basket!

173
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:38,935
And this crazy girl!

174
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:42,078
Now I don't know in which corners
my tomatoes are lying!

175
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:46,348
I will pick it up from here! You
pick it from there! - Okay!

176
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:51,347
You stupid weirdo!

177
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:52,481
Which world do you live in huh?

178
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,621
I have missed my train
because of you.

179
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,292
My entire luggage has gone!
I have lost everything!

180
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,895
And now I am stuck in these
clothes and slippers..

181
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:02,297
.. on this God forsaken platform
called Barnagar?

182
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,967
What will I do now?

183
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:06,629
Did I tell you to get
down from the train?

184
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,638
Can't you mind your own business?

185
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:12,901
Oh! So It's my mistake! Shameless!

186
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:16,446
I was helping you! You
should be thanking me!

187
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,311
And instead you are
showing me attitude!

188
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:22,442
Okay! Thank you! Thank
you for helping me!

189
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,045
Now will you please leave me alone?

190
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,050
Leave you alone?

191
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:29,984
I see! It's not so easy!

192
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:32,320
I have missed my train
because of you!

193
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,662
So now you will take me to Bhatinda!

194
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,335
To my house! Along will my
entire luggage! You see?

195
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:40,529
I am not going to spare you!

196
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:44,668
Don't have any doubt! I am
a Sikh girl from Bhatinda!

197
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,018
Hey! He is running away!
Nab this man!

198
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,554
Thief! Thief! Thief!

199
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:58,414
Thief!

200
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,957
Hey!
- Move!

201
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:01,424
Nab that thief!

202
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:04,152
Shameless! Throw away your uniform!

203
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,358
Ma'am!

204
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,437
Hey!
- Hurry up!

205
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:22,046
Yes! Come on! Come on! Come on!

206
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:32,523
Yes! God heard your prayers!
Now come on, move!

207
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,059
What are you doing?

208
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:44,729
How will we catch the
train like this?

209
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:47,602
You can't catch the train anyway.

210
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:53,077
Ratlam is the next station.1 00
kms away.

211
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:59,747
What do you know what you are?

212
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,747
He is mad! He is totally mad!

213
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:07,023
Stop the car!
- What?

214
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:09,417
Stop the car!
- What happened?

215
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,089
What happened?

216
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,029
O God! Couldn't you
hold it for sometime!

217
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,438
Get in! Come on!

218
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:24,772
Hey! What? What are you doing?
What are you doing?

219
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:32,110
Stop! Stop! Stop!

220
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:33,651
Don't disturb! There
will be an accident!

221
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,044
Mark Three.. this a Mark
Three Ambassador.

222
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:40,784
Mister! Please stop! Stop!

223
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:43,060
Everything is shaking!
The car is shaking!

224
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:44,186
Everything is shaking!

225
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:45,321
You don't be tense! Listen to me!

226
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,127
This man is no ordinary man!
Look at his style..

227
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,258
He has lots of money!

228
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:52,462
I bought this car by
selling my land..

229
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,802
No good can be done by this!

230
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,600
Look, we all are in this situation
because of him..

231
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,603
If anything breaks.. he
will pay for the damage!

232
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,810
You don't worry! I will
ensure that he pays!

233
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,141
Stop the car! Stop the car!

234
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:07,685
If anything happens to this car,
then everything will be ruined!

235
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:08,811
Nothing will happen!

236
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:21,290
Hey! My fare!

237
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,361
Where are you running away? My fare!

238
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:25,226
Give me my fare!

239
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,638
Hey! Where are you running away?

240
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,768
Hey! They are running away
without paying my fare!

241
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:33,769
'Passengers pay attention.'

242
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:39,377
The train on Platform no. 1
is 21 37 Punjab Mail to Delhi.

243
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:40,709
The train will stop at
Ratlam for 1 0 minutes

244
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:41,844
Get in!
- What about you?

245
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,522
Look, don't try to help me anymore!

246
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,387
I am fine alone.. All right!

247
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,518
My fare! Give me my fare!
- Stop!

248
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:50,653
You are running away!
- Hang on!

249
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,189
Ma'am, you were saying..

250
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:58,392
Money. I need to borrow some money!
I want to buy water!

251
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,662
I will return it in the train!

252
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,198
Do you have more? Its
full fare right?

253
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:05,268
Look, I am paying you alright.
You quietly stand here! Got it?

254
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,410
Water! I am breathless! By God!

255
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,141
Cold drinks have their own
place but finally..

256
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:13,548
..only water can
quench your thirst!

257
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:17,882
Its said.. best things
in the world are free!

258
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,758
But now even water is no
longer free! How much?

259
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,218
14 rupees!

260
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:24,228
Why? Railway prices are cheaper!

261
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,487
Ma'am, this is the rate!
- Is that so?

262
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:28,699
Shall I ask the consumer
court what's the rate!

263
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:30,626
You are trying to fool me!

264
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,569
For 2 rupees you are
arguing so much!

265
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:35,171
If 2 rupees are nothing, then
why are you stealing?

266
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:37,173
Stealing?
- Then what?

267
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:38,709
And you are saying
that I am arguing!

268
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,236
Return my money!

269
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:43,439
Here!

270
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:08,731
Stop!

271
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:16,477
Stop! Somebody pull the chain! Stop!

272
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,283
Stop! Stop!

273
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:55,449
Hey, look at her. - She is alone.

274
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,984
Hey, let's go and ask her.

275
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,461
The next station is Kota. I
will call the station master.

276
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:11,268
He will keep your luggage there.

277
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:17,869
Nothing else can be done.

278
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:23,681
But how will I reach there? Shit.

279
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,816
Who told you to get
down from the train?

280
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,687
You should have been alert!

281
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:33,949
Now what will you do?

282
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:39,820
Zest of youth! You don't understand!

283
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:40,956
You don't understand!

284
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,702
Look.. Iife is like
a railway track..

285
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:50,038
1 inch bend. And a distance
of many miles..

286
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:55,038
Your small mistake
can ruin your life!

287
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,377
Yes! I too have missed many trains..

288
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:04,318
But at that time I was a man!

289
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:09,784
I mean I am still a man..
but.. you are a girl.

290
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:13,660
A girl travelling alone is
like an open treasure box!

291
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,325
Yes! Do you know? Do you know?

292
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:18,460
What all things could
happen with you?

293
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,397
I will tell you! Look..

294
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,873
Excuse me! I want to ask you..

295
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,740
What you are saying.. do
you charge money for it?

296
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:28,939
Or is this free education?

297
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:30,480
No, this is for free.

298
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:33,077
Good! Because I don't
have any small change!

299
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:36,683
Look, old man! Stop this nonsense.
And do your work!

300
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,880
Call Kota! The rest is my problem..

301
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:40,754
I will handle it!
You.. Quickly call!

302
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:46,021
Come on! Come on!

303
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:49,761
A 23 Seat Number passenger's
luggage..

304
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:06,575
Your water!

305
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:10,514
I am not a thief! It's really bad!

306
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:12,988
What happened? What happened?

307
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,586
This poor girl missed her train!

308
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:19,057
There is no train till morning!
- O God!

309
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:20,998
Is she alone?
- Yes!

310
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:23,798
Now what will she do?

311
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:26,130
Exactly! Do you know?

312
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:29,600
A girl travelling alone is
like an open treasure box!

313
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:33,403
Listen, don't try to act smart!
Got it? Get lost!

314
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:35,809
Am I a bomb that I will explode?

315
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,413
Try to understand, ma'am!

316
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:40,414
Before somebody tries to
take undue advantage..

317
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:43,147
..I thought.. I will help you.

318
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:47,150
Don't let her stay here
at night alone..

319
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,825
You will have to take some trouble.

320
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,952
But.. take her somewhere.

321
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:53,028
Yes. There is no other option.

322
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:58,025
Don't try to act too smart!
Got it? Get lost!

323
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,962
This is the limit! Nobody
appreciates decency!

324
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,439
Tell me! I am taking you to
the right place and you..

325
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:04,566
Shut up!

326
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:07,169
I will give you a slap
if you talk too much!

327
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:14,184
Let her slap you. At least
she will touch you.

328
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:19,713
Fine! If this is what makes
you happy, then slap me.

329
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,451
Fulfil your wish. Slap me.

330
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,522
Slap me!

331
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,866
Where are you going? Today I wont
leave before you slap me!

332
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:35,931
Mister!

333
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:41,136
Hey!

334
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:44,006
Oh no!

335
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,234
Hey! Come!

336
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:13,773
Come on! Come on!

337
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:17,245
Just one man.. Full night!
My place! Come on!

338
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:28,050
I am not that!

339
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:30,052
What?

340
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:34,590
That!

341
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:42,130
Listen! If you want money,
then I will give it to you!

342
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:43,799
Why are you acting pricey?

343
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:45,940
Come on! Come!

344
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:48,937
Listen!

345
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:51,278
You drunkard! You come here
everyday! Get lost!

346
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,808
Come!

347
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,283
Why are you making me run around
at night? Listen to me!

348
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:00,085
I will pay you!

349
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,285
She is acting so smugly! Listen!

350
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,761
Thank you, Baba! Thank you!

351
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,095
O God! God knows what would
have happened today!

352
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:16,640
Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you! Thank you!

353
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,978
You missed the train again?

354
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:26,778
And who is this joker on the bike?

355
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,854
Hi! I am Geet!

356
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:39,319
Aditya!
- Aditya! Pleased to meet you..

357
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,592
Infact.. I have never felt as
pleased meeting anybody..

358
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:43,998
..as I feel after meeting you today!

359
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,663
Because you are the one who has
started all these problems!

360
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:51,007
Remember.. I told you not
to have any doubt..

361
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:56,611
I will not let you go! You
will escort me home!

362
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:59,877
I have seen that you have
money in your wallet..

363
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:01,814
We will stay in some
hotel till morning

364
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,954
Then we will go to Kota.Collect
the luggage.

365
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:06,149
And then all the way
to Bhatinda! Come on!

366
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:11,359
Come! You can give me this
look while walking too!

367
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,688
Come on! Come on! Come on!

368
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:22,633
Ratlam! Come on! It's the limit!

369
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:26,375
What does this mean? I am roaming
in the lanes of Ratlam!

370
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,638
From the train I would watch
these houses, these lanes!

371
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:32,706
Life is so strange! Right?

372
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:35,243
You are having a lot of fun, right?

373
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:36,912
As if we have come for a picnic.

374
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:40,054
You should be kept in a museum!

375
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:41,921
People should be charged
for seeing you!

376
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:46,860
What's the matter? And where
should you be kept?

377
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:49,733
You are in the train but you don't
know where the train is going!

378
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,730
You get down on some
unknown station!

379
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:53,668
Then you drive the car
like a crazy man..

380
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:56,673
..almost killing me..
you reach here.

381
00:27:57,008 --> 00:28:01,069
And here.. you are walking
in the dark lanes!

382
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,205
Alone! In the lanes of Ratlam!

383
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,678
What is your problem? Tell me!

384
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,878
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

385
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:13,018
You don't share your problems
with anybody!

386
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:17,958
Right! Are you Bachchan's
fan? Angry young man!

387
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:24,832
Today you will be very happy!
Agnipath! Agnipath!

388
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:29,705
Tell me! Who is your favourite hero?

389
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,439
Tell me! This is not a secret!

390
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:37,709
Where have I come? What
am I doing? Why?

391
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,387
Come on! Please!

392
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,126
Do you accept credit card?

393
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:01,732
No credit! Only cash!
- Credit card!

394
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:05,936
What's the tariff?
- What?

395
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,737
How much do you charge for
a room for a single day?

396
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,274
Do you need the room per hour?

397
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,747
Just answer what l
am asking you! OK?

398
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:18,152
How much for a room for a day?

399
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:19,815
Why do you need it
for the whole day?

400
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:20,949
We don't have to stay
here the whole day!

401
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:24,426
Listen, let me talk! - Yes. You
are talking a lot of sense.

402
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:25,821
As it is we have less money!

403
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:27,364
We will take the room
on a per hour basis!

404
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,956
Geet! You are not understanding
what he is..

405
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:31,501
Be practical! Why do
you feel ashamed?

406
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,294
We need it just for a few hours!

407
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:34,830
We will take the room
on per hour basis!

408
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,842
How many hours?

409
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,306
2.. 2 hours will be enough?

410
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:48,916
Fine! To be on the
safe side 3 hours!

411
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:50,386
3 hours are more than enough!

412
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,187
3 hours!

413
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:01,189
Ok.

414
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:14,937
Where did you find her?
- In the train!

415
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,881
In the train? You met
her in the train?

416
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:22,410
Nice idea!

417
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:26,356
Listen, how is the girl?

418
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:32,822
Hot! Beauty!

419
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:35,831
Thanks! 3 hours!

420
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,441
What were you whispering to him?

421
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,838
You are such a cartoon!
Do you know that?

422
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:56,844
Possible! But I know karate!
- So?

423
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:00,581
I am just informing you!
I am brown belt!

424
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,853
I see! I see! I see!
You know karate.

425
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:10,867
Meaning if I tried to rape you..
then you will use karate on me!

426
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:12,061
Right?

427
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:15,462
Possible! I mean yes! Absolutely!

428
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:20,002
I just look like this.. But
I have beaten many people!

429
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:26,009
Don't worry! I won't rape you!

430
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:30,286
You can't do it!
- I don't want to do it!

431
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:31,884
Even if you wanted to, you couldn't!

432
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:34,957
Are you trying to provoke
me to rape you?

433
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:36,424
No! I am just trying to clear it

434
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,294
So that you don't get
any wrong signal!

435
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,421
I hugged you at the station.

436
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:41,624
And I said let's go to some hotel.

437
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,095
I don't know what you
must be thinking.

438
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:45,969
That too a man like you!

439
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:48,302
A man like me? Meaning?

440
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:50,964
Girls must be hovering
around you in Mumbai!

441
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:52,367
Those kinds of girls!

442
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,311
But let me tell you that l
am not that kind of a girl

443
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:56,972
Don't even think of it!

444
00:31:57,982 --> 00:32:00,644
My thinking is orthodox!
One man woman!

445
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,516
And I have a boyfriend! Anshuman!

446
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:06,984
One and only! Forever and ever!

447
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,917
You will be happy to know that
I too am a one woman man

448
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:11,052
All right?

449
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:14,389
Look at this!

450
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:19,469
Show! Show! Show! Wow! She
is really beautiful!

451
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:21,196
You are very lucky!

452
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:26,673
No! I am not lucky!
- What?

453
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:34,541
Oh! So this is the problem!
This girl has dumped you!

454
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:40,490
Life has dumped me!
- What do you mean?

455
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,487
O God! The famous silence!

456
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:49,032
What is this great secret of yours?

457
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:51,692
I have told you everything!
Why can't you tell me?

458
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:57,372
Anyway! Look! Look at this photo!

459
00:32:57,575 --> 00:32:59,975
This girl has ditched you.
Right? Hold this!

460
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:04,506
Burn it!

461
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,507
Come on, Geet! You can't be serious!

462
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,179
I am damn serious! Burn
the photograph!

463
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:09,583
What childishness is this!

464
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:12,179
Listen to me! Do this childish
deed! Burn this!

465
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:15,248
You will feel really good! Burn her!

466
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,385
Here!

467
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:20,997
Burn it! Burn it! No tension!

468
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,059
Burn it!

469
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,206
Okay! Now go to the bathroom!

470
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:39,611
And flush her out of your
life forever! Go!

471
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,100
Do you feel better?

472
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,103
You know what?

473
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,776
Doing this foolish thing..

474
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:13,040
I am actually feeling nice!

475
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:14,243
I am actually feeling better!

476
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,111
You were right!

477
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,785
See? And shall I tell you the truth?

478
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:23,591
You are not bad looking!
You are handsome

479
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:25,320
You seem to be rich too!

480
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:27,731
You will find much better
girls than her!

481
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,465
She was nothing compared to you!

482
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,465
Thank you. That's very kind.

483
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,471
I am telling you! Am I not a girl?

484
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:40,340
Any girl will be smitten by you!
You are of that type!

485
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,675
Look, I am getting married
to Anshuman and all that

486
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:46,080
But if he had not been in my
life then you never know..

487
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:51,680
Maybe I would have been smitten
too! Just imagine!

488
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:57,820
You like yourself a lot, don't you?

489
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,488
A lot! I am my favourite!

490
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:04,626
What happened?

491
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:07,103
I wish I too could
have been like you.

492
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,164
That is very difficult.

493
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,500
But you will find a better
girl.. that's for sure!

494
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:15,168
Why don't you only find
a good one for me?

495
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:17,840
Tell me something. Do you like me?

496
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,111
What?
- Look! Look at me!

497
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:23,643
What kind of question is this!
Geet, don't be stupid!

498
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:24,779
Tell me!

499
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:28,124
Quickly open the door! Run!

500
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:30,183
Wear your clothes! And quickly run!

501
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:32,519
Give me the full amount!
- Hello! What happened?

502
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:35,529
There is a raid! There is a raid!

503
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,193
Come on! Come on!

504
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:39,327
Come on!

505
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:40,461
Come on! Come on!

506
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:43,132
Come on! Run!

507
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:45,141
Hey! What is going on?

508
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:47,143
We will have to run!
- Why?

509
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:48,269
Police!
- Police!

510
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:49,472
Come on!

511
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:51,739
Come on!

512
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,208
Quickly! Hurry up!

513
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:57,152
Everybody quickly run!
I will open the back door!

514
00:35:57,221 --> 00:35:58,688
Listen!

515
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:02,224
What is going on? What happened?

516
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,563
Come on! Come on! Hurry up!

517
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:10,226
What happened? Why are we
acting like smugglers?

518
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:13,166
Next time get some suitcase
to show to the police

519
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:14,363
That you belong to a good family

520
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:16,167
But I missed my luggage
in the train!

521
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,764
For the first time I am
seeing a train girl

522
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,639
Why don't you book a compartment
in the train?

523
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,701
Like those meant only
for two people..

524
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:22,837
I will tell you next time! Come on!

525
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:24,439
Come on! Come on! Come on!

526
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:30,244
What was he saying?
- Run! Run!

527
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:40,788
Please, Babajii! This is the limit!

528
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,190
Please don't give any more
excitement for this night!

529
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:45,928
Now please make this night boring!

530
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,269
The bus will leave in the
morning at 6 o'clock.

531
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:03,486
Are you feeling sleepy?
- No! What about you?

532
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:16,295
That.. Why were you asking me
whether I like you or not.

533
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:21,294
Yes! Tell me! Do you like me?
- But why?

534
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:23,630
There is no answer for this why!

535
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:26,438
Do you like me? Nice, sweet, great?

536
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,977
Tell me quickly!
- Yes!

537
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,238
Yes?
- Yes!

538
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:35,444
If you like me, then you
will like my sister too.

539
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:38,986
Roop. My cousin. She
is just like me!

540
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:44,659
Listen to me. I am going
to elope every soon

541
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:48,457
With Anshuman! You
and Roop too elope!

542
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:51,791
Your problem too is the same.
Grandpa won't agree!

543
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:54,998
And then all four of us will live
together in the mountains.

544
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,467
We will have great fun!
What do you say?

545
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:03,008
Why don't we do this?
We both will elope.

546
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,475
We both will get married.
And live in the mountains.

547
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:05,810
Look, it's a convenient option.

548
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:08,477
If we don't go to Bhatinda now,
then we are eloping anyway.

549
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:14,691
Look.. if you marry Roop then
I will be your sister-in-law.

550
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:15,817
Half wife.

551
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:17,554
What will I do with just half?
I want you completely.

552
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:22,027
You will get complete Roop.
And me partly.

553
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,827
Okay! Okay! Okay! It's
a bargain offer!

554
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:29,969
Yes. Half free with one!
Free! Free! Free!

555
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:34,836
That makes sense! But if I marry
you, the offer is still valid.

556
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,373
I am talking to you about
an alliance with my sister

557
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:40,047
And you are flirting with me!

558
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:43,511
Do you always talk nonsense?

559
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:44,986
Or today is a special occasion?

560
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:48,324
No! I always talk nonsense! You?

561
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:51,327
This is my first time! Actually
I have never met a girl like you.

562
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,389
Come to Bhatinda! I will
introduce you to one!

563
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:32,427
When we started walking.

564
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:36,370
The paths too started moving.

565
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:45,114
These paths seem lovelier
than the destination.

566
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:48,784
Come. Let's get lost.

567
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:53,448
Let's get lost somewhere.

568
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:57,386
Come.. Let's walk for miles.

569
00:39:57,595 --> 00:40:01,725
Where to go? It should be unknown.

570
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,530
When we started walking.

571
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:09,601
The paths too started moving.

572
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:18,610
These paths seem lovelier
than the destination.

573
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:43,439
Sitting like this, how will
we discover a new path.

574
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:47,842
You too walk. And I too will walk.

575
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:52,110
Only then will these distances
bridge someday.

576
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:57,053
Sitting like this, we
discover a new path.

577
00:40:57,121 --> 00:41:00,181
Come..We both should have
no bond with anybody.

578
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:04,191
Come.. Let's walk for miles.

579
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:08,530
Where to go? It should be unknown.

580
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:12,869
When we started walking.

581
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:16,801
The paths too started moving.

582
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:25,677
These paths seem lovelier
than the destination.

583
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,901
I don't like it without you.

584
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,839
I don't like it without you.

585
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:54,901
On opening the eyes, slumber says.

586
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:58,574
What fervour is this?

587
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:03,112
Here and there. God knows where.

588
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:06,918
This fervour is taking me.

589
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:15,664
Come. We will find
a way in this world.

590
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:19,266
Let's walk for miles.

591
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:23,600
Where to go? It should be unknown.

592
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:27,669
When we started walking.

593
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:31,945
The paths too started moving.

594
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:40,752
These paths seem lovelier
than the destination.

595
00:42:56,774 --> 00:42:57,832
You are great..

596
00:42:58,642 --> 00:43:00,974
I have never heard anybody
sing so well!

597
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:02,577
You should have been a singer!

598
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:08,313
A person doesn't always
get what he wants.

599
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,577
Why? I think that whatever a person
really, actually wants..

600
00:43:12,656 --> 00:43:15,648
..is what he gets.

601
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:20,792
You know there was a time
when I really wanted..

602
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:23,796
There was no greater passion
in my life than music!

603
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,594
Your life is over now?

604
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,599
You are talking as though are dead!

605
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:32,735
Its not over but..

606
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:37,012
Now music.. can't happen anymore.

607
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,607
Why? Why can't you do it?
What is your helplessness?

608
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:41,810
Tell me!

609
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:48,353
O God! Don't tell me! Fine!

610
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:51,021
But don't become an angry
young man again. Please!

611
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,688
Okay.

612
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:04,701
I will start the conversation
- Of course!

613
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,045
The water is so nice right?
- Yes!

614
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:13,778
Have you ever jumped in
such a lake before?

615
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:17,848
Geet, I think we should be leaving!

616
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:19,650
We should try it! We
will have great fun!

617
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:21,247
Hang on! Hang on! I wanted
to ask you something.

618
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,923
Have you ever consulted
a physiatrist?

619
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:26,258
O shut up!
- No! You need one, Geet!

620
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:29,663
Shut up! And let's jump! - Okay!
Just relax! Just listen to me!

621
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:32,201
Just think! We might not get the
chance to do such a thing again!

622
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:34,863
I don't want to do such a thing
ever! Have you gone mad?

623
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:37,736
You have tried being childish
right? You had great fun

624
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:40,402
Now try madness!
- Geet, relax! Listen to me!

625
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:52,747
It was so much fun!

626
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:54,757
You need a physiatrist!

627
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:02,757
Don't look here!

628
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:07,694
Have you heard Dharamraj
Kashyap's name?

629
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:12,436
The industrialist? Of course!
He died last year! Why?

630
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:14,235
I am his son!

631
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:28,450
You.. are Aditya.. Kashyap!

632
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:31,252
Yes!

633
00:45:32,863 --> 00:45:33,921
Now you know me.

634
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:38,401
You are the Kashyap!

635
00:45:40,938 --> 00:45:43,133
It was your mother that ran
away with another man?

636
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,143
Shit. Sorry.

637
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,880
Yes! It was my mother.. who
ran away with another man.

638
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:57,744
Actually I heard it in the
news in this language..

639
00:45:57,821 --> 00:46:01,086
So it came out that way. I am
really sorry. Really, really!

640
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:07,161
No, Geet! I will have to hear it!
Why you are you saying sorry?

641
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:11,163
If somebody's mother
can be so cheap..

642
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:13,963
..if she can do such a
derogatory deed then..

643
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:17,837
Mr. Kashyap! You shouldn't talk
so disrespectfully about her

644
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:22,168
Why? That woman destroyed
my entire family

645
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:23,971
Because of her I will feel ashamed..

646
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:25,378
..in front of everybody all my life!

647
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,182
So why shouldn't I talk
disrespectfully?

648
00:46:27,384 --> 00:46:32,515
Because she was in love!
- Love? Are you serious!

649
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:34,987
Look.. she is your mother.

650
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,852
So it's difficult to understand
this about her.

651
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:39,794
But when somebody is in love..

652
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:41,524
..then nothing is right or wrong!

653
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:43,525
Who told you all this?

654
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,928
In which stupid novel did
you read all these lines?

655
00:46:46,403 --> 00:46:48,871
Everybody says so! All
is fair in love!

656
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:50,998
Everybody lies! It's
all hogwash! Got it?

657
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:55,335
Yes! Yes!

658
00:46:58,215 --> 00:47:01,810
Listen! You are so rich!

659
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:05,946
Elope with my sister! Everybody's
life will prosper!

660
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:11,884
You.. are an original piece!
Do you know that?

661
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:13,420
There is no other girl like you!

662
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,232
She has come!

663
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,367
Coming!

664
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:30,905
Hi, Amrik!

665
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:34,041
She has come! She has come!
Geet has come, aunt!

666
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:38,049
So what's the plan?
- Let's see!

667
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:40,247
You come inside with me!

668
00:47:40,324 --> 00:47:43,851
No, no! No, Geet! I.. I will leave.

669
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:45,920
Where will you go?

670
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:49,456
I will be okay! Don't worry!

671
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:53,602
No! You come inside with me!

672
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,069
I can't let you go
like this! Come on!

673
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:58,271
Geet, really l.. I got to go!

674
00:47:58,342 --> 00:48:01,277
Look, my family is here! Don't
create a scene in front of them!

675
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:03,879
You stay here for sometime.
I want to talk to you.

676
00:48:03,947 --> 00:48:05,471
Then you can leave! Come on!
- Geet!

677
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:07,942
Hi, mother!

678
00:48:08,485 --> 00:48:10,612
Geet!
- Hi, sexy aunt!

679
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:14,080
The authorities in the hostel
didn't look after my niece well!

680
00:48:14,157 --> 00:48:15,215
She has become so thin!

681
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:16,951
How are you?

682
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:20,889
Come! Come! Come on!

683
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:25,960
Uncle!

684
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:28,228
Greetings, grandpa!

685
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:30,965
Who is this guy?

686
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:34,639
He is my friend, grandpa.
- What kind of friend?

687
00:48:35,512 --> 00:48:38,037
Grandpa, that is not so!
- What?

688
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:42,446
I mean.. he is just a friend.
- Then why did you bring him home?

689
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:46,981
Grandpa.. he is the one
who has brought me home.

690
00:48:47,057 --> 00:48:50,458
I missed the train at
a station in the night.

691
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:51,986
If he had not been there..

692
00:48:52,062 --> 00:48:55,930
You know. A girl travelling alone
is like an open treasure box.

693
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:59,325
I didn't even know him.
We met on the train.

694
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:02,337
Still he has travelled
so far with me.

695
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:04,931
To Bhatinda! To escort
me home safely!

696
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:06,537
No other kind of friendship?

697
00:49:07,544 --> 00:49:10,945
Because in my age.. in a
glimpse I get to know..

698
00:49:11,014 --> 00:49:14,142
..what is going on between
a boy and a girl.

699
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:17,942
Grandpa, please. You
are embarrassing me.

700
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:19,147
Embarrassing you?

701
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,356
If you had any shame..

702
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:23,358
Then would you have come home
wearing such clothes?

703
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,959
If you can come home wearing
such clothes..

704
00:49:25,028 --> 00:49:27,223
then in Mumbai you must
be roaming around naked.

705
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,026
What's his name?

706
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:36,371
Aditya!
- Aditya what?

707
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,373
Aditya Kumar!

708
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,036
Yeah!

709
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:46,040
What work do you do?

710
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:49,384
I.. am a musician.

711
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:52,183
Dear, I am indebted to you!

712
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:57,120
Now you will have to stay
here for a week. With us..

713
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:01,988
So that we can thank you properly
- Okay!

714
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:04,397
May God protect you!

715
00:50:05,535 --> 00:50:07,526
People in Mumbai don't eat much!

716
00:50:07,604 --> 00:50:08,662
That is true!

717
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:10,536
Enough! Enough! Enough! Please!

718
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:12,006
Please! My stomach will
blow apart! Please!

719
00:50:12,075 --> 00:50:15,533
What nonsense! Have you ever heard
of somebody's stomach blowing up?

720
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:18,137
Then what? It's really strong!

721
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:21,150
No.. Geet! Geet! Geet!
Please save me!

722
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:24,347
You people didn't give
him buttermilk?

723
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:27,419
He has come to Punjab and
nobody gave him buttermilk?

724
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:28,549
I will get it!

725
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:29,683
What are you doing?

726
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,024
I have some work with
you! Come inside!

727
00:50:32,095 --> 00:50:34,029
You have saved my sister!
I can do anything for you!

728
00:50:34,097 --> 00:50:35,621
I made a mistake by
saving your sister!

729
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:37,758
Henceforth I won't save
anybody's sister!

730
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:43,234
Son, you go ahead. I will
get a night dress for you.

731
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:48,039
Okay. O God Amrik! I will die!

732
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:50,579
Nothing will happen! Come on!

733
00:50:50,647 --> 00:50:53,639
You don't understand!
My stomach will tear!

734
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:56,576
You go and check whether the
guest room is open or not.

735
00:51:01,258 --> 00:51:02,316
What happened?

736
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:04,451
There is a problem.
- Now what happened?

737
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:06,052
I had told you that here nobody..

738
00:51:06,129 --> 00:51:08,461
..knows about Anshuman..

739
00:51:12,202 --> 00:51:13,464
Geet! What are you doing?

740
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:18,470
Good that you came! Aditya,
she is my sister Roop!

741
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:21,670
Roop, he is Aditya! You
have to elope with him!

742
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:25,671
Geet! Think for a second
before you start talking.

743
00:51:26,683 --> 00:51:28,207
And what were you doing inside?

744
00:51:29,352 --> 00:51:33,083
Possessive! Already you
are feeling jealous!

745
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:36,090
Don't worry! We were not doing that!

746
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:40,356
He is a one woman man! He
will be faithful to you!

747
00:51:41,498 --> 00:51:43,489
The room is open!
- So take him!

748
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:46,160
Why are you making
him stand here? Go!

749
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,700
Listen. You look there!
It's a secret!

750
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:56,176
Tomorrow morning get up early!

751
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:59,443
There is an old tractor in the
field..We will meet there!

752
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:01,643
Why?
- Bye! Goodnight!

753
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:11,185
Goodnight!

754
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:39,145
Wow! Today you are looking
very stylish!

755
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:41,749
You haven't seen anything yet..

756
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:43,558
Just wait and watch..

757
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:48,893
That's great! You speak
Punjabi so fluently!

758
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:50,426
That's my style too!

759
00:52:50,767 --> 00:52:53,565
From where did you learn how
to speak Punjabi so fluently!

760
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:56,697
My.. my mom was a Punjabi!

761
00:52:57,174 --> 00:53:00,234
Oh Yes! So why don't
you talk in Punjabi?

762
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:03,177
Just like that!
- You should do it, you know.

763
00:53:04,714 --> 00:53:07,239
You woke me up at 5 in the
morning for this chit-chat?

764
00:53:07,784 --> 00:53:11,185
No! There is a problem!
- What happened?

765
00:53:11,254 --> 00:53:14,712
Manjeet is coming!
- Who is this Manjeet now?

766
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:18,727
Manjeet Mann! They had shifted
to Patiala a few years ago!

767
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:22,256
Grandpa and the rest have fixed
my marriage with Manjeet!

768
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:24,727
And they are coming today to see me!

769
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:25,859
Hold on! Hold on!

770
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:27,327
Your opinion won't be taken
into consideration?

771
00:53:27,404 --> 00:53:28,462
They will get you married
just like that?

772
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:31,939
Actually there is a twist
in the tale. - Go ahead.

773
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:35,269
These Mann's.. they are
our old family friends.

774
00:53:35,745 --> 00:53:37,542
Manjeet and I have been
together since childhood.

775
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,206
Everybody said that
we will get them..

776
00:53:40,283 --> 00:53:41,944
..married when they will grow up!

777
00:53:42,419 --> 00:53:45,752
I would feel nice to hear
that I will marry Manjeet.

778
00:53:46,356 --> 00:53:49,553
While playing family, I never
let Roop be Manjeet's wife!

779
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:53,219
When we were 8 years old,
Manjeet and I would..

780
00:53:53,296 --> 00:53:55,230
..stand on this tractor and
hold hands and say that

781
00:53:55,298 --> 00:53:57,425
we will build our house
on those fields

782
00:53:57,834 --> 00:53:58,960
Then I grew up

783
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:01,836
And I considered this Manjeet
episode as a joke!

784
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,297
But yesterday I came to
know that my parents..

785
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:04,965
..have not grown up.

786
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:07,369
They are serious! Everybody
is serious

787
00:54:07,444 --> 00:54:08,968
And now I am in trouble!

788
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:12,439
So now what?

789
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:13,641
I am running away!

790
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:17,377
You always talk of running away!
Don't even think of that!

791
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:19,251
It's really a cheap thing to do!

792
00:54:19,322 --> 00:54:21,517
There is so many risks and
other problems involved..

793
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:23,317
There is no other option!

794
00:54:23,393 --> 00:54:24,655
There are countless options!
- Like?

795
00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:27,720
Like.. tell your parents
about Anshuman!

796
00:54:28,398 --> 00:54:29,456
They won't agree!

797
00:54:29,866 --> 00:54:32,460
In fact they will trap me here
by emotionally blackmailing me!

798
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:33,862
Bad option!

799
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:36,265
Look, if you can't explain
to your parents..

800
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:38,000
..then forget Anshuman!

801
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:40,334
Next option!

802
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:43,004
Don't marry anybody!
- Next!

803
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:48,945
Get Manjeet and Roop married!
- Next!

804
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:51,684
In the court prove that
Manjeet is impotent!

805
00:54:52,822 --> 00:54:54,483
He is not impotent! Next!

806
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:56,950
How do you know? Hang on! Hang on!

807
00:54:57,761 --> 00:54:59,626
How do you know that Manjeet
is not impotent?

808
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:02,356
You can tell!

809
00:55:02,565 --> 00:55:07,366
You can tell? Did you and he..
- Next!

810
00:55:08,505 --> 00:55:11,440
Did he tell you that?
- Next!

811
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:15,509
Did you see him with somebody?
- Next!

812
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:28,852
Mr. Dhillon! Great to see you..

813
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:30,384
All are fools!

814
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:32,386
Look, how happy they are!

815
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:36,057
What do they know that
I am going to elope!

816
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,930
Don't come too close to me.
They will misunderstand.

817
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:42,600
I am not going to marry here!

818
00:55:42,939 --> 00:55:44,998
All these wrestlers will bash me up!

819
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:48,607
Endure it for me, beloved!

820
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:50,608
Let go of my shirt!
What are you doing?

821
00:55:52,882 --> 00:55:55,077
This is a nice idea! To
stop this marriage!

822
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:56,819
This is the right option!

823
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:58,548
You stay away from me! Got it?

824
00:56:01,958 --> 00:56:03,016
Hello!

825
00:56:08,631 --> 00:56:09,757
Hello!
- How are you?

826
00:56:10,433 --> 00:56:12,901
Fine! Long time!
- 3 years almost!

827
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,565
After Jaspreet's marriage.
- Yes!

828
00:56:15,972 --> 00:56:17,769
And.. how are things in Mumbai?

829
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:24,370
You people too can talk!
There is no punishment!

830
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:26,576
She says to talk!

831
00:56:26,983 --> 00:56:28,780
Aditya!
- Yes!

832
00:56:28,852 --> 00:56:30,911
Listen!
- Yes!

833
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:35,653
Daarji's calling..

834
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:40,993
Come! Come! I will introduce him!
- Who is he.

835
00:56:41,931 --> 00:56:44,525
He is Aditya! He is a musician!

836
00:56:45,602 --> 00:56:47,001
You won't remember everybody's name!

837
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:48,928
So meet the main guest.

838
00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:50,664
Manjeet Singh Mann!

839
00:56:52,609 --> 00:56:53,803
Hi, Manjeet!
- How are you?

840
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:55,135
Sit!
- No, no!

841
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:57,937
He is a really nice singer!
- I see!

842
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:00,940
Shouldn't he be singing a song
on this happy occasion?

843
00:57:01,017 --> 00:57:02,416
Yes! Why not?

844
00:57:02,485 --> 00:57:05,545
No, no! She is just joking!
- No, no! I am serious!

845
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:07,149
Am I laughing? Look!

846
00:57:08,024 --> 00:57:09,491
Ladies and Gentlemen!

847
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,155
My friend Aditya from Mumbai!

848
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:18,026
He is going to sing
a song for you all!

849
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,432
Uncle, no, no! Please!

850
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:20,560
Please!

851
00:57:20,637 --> 00:57:23,435
So I want all of you to keep quiet!

852
00:57:23,506 --> 00:57:25,030
Listen! Please!

853
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:29,105
Look.. sit down everybody!
- Dear! - Yes!

854
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:30,504
Now you do sing!

855
00:57:30,647 --> 00:57:33,844
Let me also see what Mumbai
people can do! - Okay!

856
00:57:41,524 --> 00:57:46,621
Come! Come! Very good! Hey,
fellow! Get a chair!

857
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:48,522
Come!

858
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,593
Come! Sit! Sit!

859
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:55,128
Start!

860
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,207
Why are you all looking
at me like this?

861
00:58:06,683 --> 00:58:08,014
I will get nervous!

862
00:58:09,085 --> 00:58:11,610
No problem! Look here and
there! Here and there!

863
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:12,746
Don't look at him!

864
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:16,887
I am starting! You all
too please join in!

865
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,484
No problem!

866
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:21,625
We all too will join in!
We are Punjabis!

867
00:58:21,698 --> 00:58:22,756
We need an opportunity
to start celebrating.

868
00:58:25,101 --> 00:58:26,500
Okay! Silence! Silence!

869
00:58:26,569 --> 00:58:27,695
Settle down! Sit comfortably!

870
00:58:42,118 --> 00:58:45,918
A capricious, bubbly girl.

871
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:49,117
Her mesmerising eyes
are like daggers.

872
00:58:49,926 --> 00:58:53,794
And her beauty is lethal.

873
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:59,124
When her beauty created rampage,
the discussion started.

874
00:59:00,003 --> 00:59:03,530
Beat the drum. Beat the drum.

875
00:59:03,606 --> 00:59:07,269
Beat the drum. Beat the drum.

876
00:59:15,952 --> 00:59:19,888
A capricious, bubbly girl.

877
00:59:20,089 --> 00:59:21,556
Her mesmerising eyes
are so piercing.

878
00:59:21,624 --> 00:59:23,819
And her beauty is lethal.

879
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:27,691
Her deadly beauty is the
point of discussion.

880
00:59:29,966 --> 00:59:33,697
Beat the drum. Beat the drum.

881
00:59:34,037 --> 00:59:37,564
Beat the drum. Beat the drum.

882
00:59:58,127 --> 01:00:01,654
Whenever that girl
comes to the window.

883
01:00:02,198 --> 01:00:03,597
Some see her and die.

884
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:05,725
And some die without seeing her.

885
01:00:06,135 --> 01:00:10,003
When she would pass the lanes,
there would be festivity.

886
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:13,666
Every lover used to
celebrate and dance.

887
01:00:14,143 --> 01:00:17,738
And the feast would begin.

888
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:23,749
Beat the drum. Beat the drum.

889
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:27,684
Beat the drum. Beat the drum.

890
01:00:44,107 --> 01:00:48,043
My youth is yours in any case.

891
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:51,706
You need not try to steal my beauty.

892
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:55,712
My youth is yours in any case.

893
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:59,785
You need not try to steal my beauty.

894
01:01:00,056 --> 01:01:03,856
You need not try to steal my beauty.

895
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:07,790
Since childhood she had a beloved.

896
01:01:08,131 --> 01:01:11,726
His task was to keep the
other lovers at bay.

897
01:01:12,135 --> 01:01:15,798
The one whom he had to make
the queen of his heart.

898
01:01:16,072 --> 01:01:19,803
She was crazy for somebody else.

899
01:01:20,076 --> 01:01:24,809
One story ended and another began.

900
01:01:25,948 --> 01:01:29,748
Beat the drum. Beat the drum.

901
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:33,750
Beat the drum. Beat the drum.

902
01:01:42,098 --> 01:01:45,898
A capricious, bubbly girl.

903
01:01:46,169 --> 01:01:48,296
Her mesmerising eyes
are so piercing.

904
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:49,963
And her beauty is lethal.

905
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:54,107
Her deadly beauty is the
point of discussion.

906
01:01:56,245 --> 01:01:59,772
Beat the drum. Beat the drum.

907
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:03,849
Beat the drum. Beat the drum.

908
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:07,851
Beat the drum. Beat the drum.

909
01:02:07,924 --> 01:02:11,792
Beat the drum. Beat the drum.

910
01:02:18,267 --> 01:02:21,134
We mainly deal in fertilizers.
- Okay.

911
01:02:21,337 --> 01:02:23,805
And now we are going to enter
pesticide market too.

912
01:02:23,873 --> 01:02:24,931
Is that so?
- Uncle is planning..

913
01:02:25,007 --> 01:02:26,065
Hang on!

914
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:29,469
Hit here! Come on! Hit!
Hit! Hit! Hit!

915
01:02:29,812 --> 01:02:32,804
Superb!
- Go! Your papa is calling you!

916
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:36,151
O God!
- Now what are you going to do?

917
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:42,757
Is he coming?
- Who?

918
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:45,754
Manjeet!
- Yes!

919
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:49,030
Is he looking here?
- Yes! You stay away!

920
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:54,160
Did he see?

921
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,968
Manjeet, she is just playing
a drama! Stand straight!

922
01:03:01,177 --> 01:03:03,168
O no! Manjeet!

923
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:09,980
Look, Manjeet! What you are
thinking.. that's not true!

924
01:03:10,052 --> 01:03:12,316
She is playing a charade!
Ask her! Tell him!

925
01:03:13,189 --> 01:03:15,453
Yes, yes! He is right, Manjeet!

926
01:03:15,858 --> 01:03:18,918
There is nothing between
us! I swear!

927
01:03:19,262 --> 01:03:22,527
We are just by-the-way friends.
Tell him, Aditya!

928
01:03:23,332 --> 01:03:25,266
Nothing had happened between
us even in Mumbai!

929
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:27,997
Nothing at all! Tell him!

930
01:03:28,271 --> 01:03:32,332
Papa said he didn't call me!
- He is lying! I will come!

931
01:03:36,412 --> 01:03:37,470
Listen, brother!

932
01:03:38,014 --> 01:03:41,814
You are mistaken! There is nothing
between me and Geet!

933
01:03:42,351 --> 01:03:43,818
We didn't even meet in Mumbai!

934
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:46,212
She was just playing a charade!

935
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:48,882
I might not be smart
like city people!

936
01:03:49,425 --> 01:03:52,360
But I do have eyes! I can see!

937
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:55,024
She did all this to show you!
- Why?

938
01:03:55,097 --> 01:03:56,962
Because..
- Tell me!

939
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:58,899
Why would she want to show me this?

940
01:04:00,236 --> 01:04:01,965
You better ask her that!

941
01:04:02,371 --> 01:04:04,305
As it is you both have known
each other since childhood..

942
01:04:35,471 --> 01:04:36,529
Don't shout!

943
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:39,872
Are you mad? What
are you doing here?

944
01:04:39,942 --> 01:04:42,604
Congratulations! You
ruined everything!

945
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:44,403
I had such a nice plan in place!

946
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,948
By now Manjeet would have
returned to Patiala!

947
01:04:47,016 --> 01:04:49,610
Now he says that he will
talk to me alone!

948
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:52,013
So I am going!
- Where?

949
01:04:52,355 --> 01:04:54,084
What do you mean where?
I am running away!

950
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:57,883
Geet.. don't ever do that! Okay!

951
01:04:58,427 --> 01:05:01,487
I am doing it! Everything
is planned!

952
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:03,088
I have come say bye to you!

953
01:05:03,432 --> 01:05:05,957
You are leaving now?
As in right now?

954
01:05:06,502 --> 01:05:08,493
Yes! You stay here for a few days!

955
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:11,039
After that you go back
to Mumbai! Okay!

956
01:05:11,107 --> 01:05:13,439
Hang on! Hang on! You
are running away!

957
01:05:13,509 --> 01:05:15,443
And I should stay here!
- So?

958
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:19,905
Tomorrow Manjeet will open his
mouth and these people..

959
01:05:19,982 --> 01:05:21,916
..who already think you and
I are having an affair..

960
01:05:21,984 --> 01:05:23,918
..they will tie me with
their buffaloes!

961
01:05:24,453 --> 01:05:26,921
Great! Then you come with me too!

962
01:05:27,056 --> 01:05:31,516
If we run away together then their
suspicion will be confirmed!

963
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:35,322
Big deal! What difference
does that make to you?

964
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,992
Correct! What difference
does that make to me?

965
01:05:39,402 --> 01:05:40,460
Come on!

966
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:56,077
Listen! Did you tell Roop that
we are running away? - Why?

967
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:00,013
O God! Run!

968
01:06:00,089 --> 01:06:01,147
Geet!

969
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:07,020
Geet!

970
01:06:08,097 --> 01:06:09,155
Geet!

971
01:06:13,436 --> 01:06:14,494
Geet!

972
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:16,029
What are you doing?

973
01:06:16,105 --> 01:06:18,699
I will return in two days!
I will call you tomorrow!

974
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:20,707
And please! You are under my oath!

975
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:22,035
Don't tell anybody! Okay?

976
01:06:23,512 --> 01:06:25,707
Papa! Uncle!
- What's the plan?

977
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:27,506
Geet is running away!
- There are many options! - Options?

978
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:29,576
We can either go to the railway
station or the bus stand!

979
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:31,044
But how will we reach there?

980
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:32,985
Let's see! We might get an auto
rickshaw from the main road!

981
01:06:33,055 --> 01:06:35,387
Unbelievable, man!
- Come on!

982
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:36,516
This is your plan?

983
01:06:36,592 --> 01:06:37,991
Let's see, we might get an auto
rickshaw from the main road?

984
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:39,186
Do you have any brains?

985
01:06:39,261 --> 01:06:41,991
Did I know that Roop will see us?
Now why are we standing here?

986
01:06:42,064 --> 01:06:43,122
Let's go!
- Wait!

987
01:06:43,532 --> 01:06:45,124
Why are you looking there? Run!

988
01:06:45,201 --> 01:06:46,395
Not there! Here! Come on!

989
01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:48,061
I am not going back!

990
01:06:48,137 --> 01:06:49,399
You have created enough nuisance!

991
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:51,997
Now do as I say! Come on! Come on!

992
01:06:52,074 --> 01:06:53,541
But why are we going back?
- Just shut up and run!

993
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:03,078
Where did they go?
- Towards the road!

994
01:07:03,219 --> 01:07:04,618
You let them go? You
didn't stop them?

995
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:06,154
Satya, go and check! Hurry up!

996
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:08,081
Call the guys!

997
01:07:10,426 --> 01:07:12,018
There is a staircase for
going to the terrace.

998
01:07:12,094 --> 01:07:13,755
Why the terrace?
- Will you tell me?

999
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:16,089
Come on!

1000
01:07:16,565 --> 01:07:19,625
Hey, quickly open the garage!
Take the jeep out!

1001
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:20,760
Found them?

1002
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:22,163
Where will they go?

1003
01:07:22,571 --> 01:07:24,562
Where did you see them?
- They left from the gate!

1004
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:25,698
What happened?

1005
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:29,773
I knew it! In the first
glance I recognized him!

1006
01:07:30,112 --> 01:07:32,239
Raj, get my wallet from the room.

1007
01:07:32,314 --> 01:07:34,441
I found out what is going
on between them!

1008
01:07:35,317 --> 01:07:37,114
But you people are very
intelligent, aren't you?

1009
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,112
You people don't heed me!

1010
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:42,650
Where are you? Open the garage!

1011
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:44,117
Come on!

1012
01:07:49,198 --> 01:07:50,790
What are we doing here?

1013
01:07:52,468 --> 01:07:54,663
Look, Roop saw us going
towards the front gate!

1014
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:57,471
They would have easily caught
us in their jeeps and bikes!

1015
01:07:57,606 --> 01:07:59,471
Now they will go out! They
will call other people too!

1016
01:07:59,542 --> 01:08:00,600
They will search everywhere!

1017
01:08:00,676 --> 01:08:01,802
But they won't search the house!

1018
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:06,207
So now we will wait here!

1019
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:09,074
Then at the right time we will
leave from the backyard..

1020
01:08:09,151 --> 01:08:11,415
..and reach the taxi stand
on the other side.

1021
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:12,545
Got it?

1022
01:08:13,622 --> 01:08:16,147
You had even planned to elope
with that photograph girl?

1023
01:08:16,625 --> 01:08:17,683
Come on, Hurry up.

1024
01:08:19,228 --> 01:08:20,354
Have faith in God!

1025
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:24,497
She told us everything!
Why did she hide this?

1026
01:08:24,567 --> 01:08:26,694
All this is that Aditya's doing!

1027
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:29,298
He only has corrupted Geet's mind!

1028
01:08:29,371 --> 01:08:31,498
Listen! Carefully!
- It's all his doing!

1029
01:08:31,574 --> 01:08:32,632
You have high BP!

1030
01:08:32,708 --> 01:08:35,108
He stayed with us! He
even ate with us!

1031
01:08:35,177 --> 01:08:36,303
Don't get so angry!

1032
01:08:36,378 --> 01:08:38,107
If I catch him, I won't spare him!

1033
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:39,306
We will thrash him!

1034
01:08:39,381 --> 01:08:41,178
I will thrash him black and blue!

1035
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:54,190
Where is your boyfriend meeting you?

1036
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:56,189
In Manali!

1037
01:08:58,400 --> 01:08:59,799
He is not coming to
Bhatinda to meet you?

1038
01:09:00,669 --> 01:09:02,261
Actually I have not been
able to speak to him!

1039
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:04,530
No man!

1040
01:09:05,341 --> 01:09:07,138
Please don't tell me that
the man doesn't even know..

1041
01:09:07,209 --> 01:09:08,540
..that you are running away for him!

1042
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:12,738
What are you doing, Geet?

1043
01:09:13,749 --> 01:09:15,273
Why are you playing with your life?

1044
01:09:15,684 --> 01:09:17,675
Because it's my favourite
game! Life!

1045
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:20,213
What's yours? Football? Badminton?

1046
01:09:20,356 --> 01:09:22,221
I know! Car racing! Right?

1047
01:09:22,691 --> 01:09:24,158
You know.. I used to think that..

1048
01:09:24,226 --> 01:09:25,284
..there are many problems
in my life!

1049
01:09:26,695 --> 01:09:28,162
Now how to get out of this problem?

1050
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:31,497
You are so selfish! You are
thinking only about yourself!

1051
01:09:31,567 --> 01:09:32,625
What about me?

1052
01:09:32,701 --> 01:09:35,898
What about you? This is your
life! It's your plan!

1053
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:38,299
You are going to elope!
What am I doing here?

1054
01:09:38,374 --> 01:09:40,308
I mean, I am taking the risk of
running away with the girl!

1055
01:09:40,376 --> 01:09:41,707
People are looking to murder me!

1056
01:09:41,777 --> 01:09:43,438
And I don't even get
the girl! Great!

1057
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:46,241
I told you to elope with Roop!

1058
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:53,321
You are having fun! Right?

1059
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:02,459
Uncle has gone to the
railway station!

1060
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:04,598
Has asked should we
inform the police?

1061
01:10:04,667 --> 01:10:06,726
No! Don't inform the police!

1062
01:10:06,802 --> 01:10:09,202
You have to go to school!
So go to sleep!

1063
01:10:09,605 --> 01:10:11,197
Fine! I will check the bus stand!

1064
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:12,598
Take my cell along!

1065
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:19,477
Don't worry! Everything
will be fine! Just watch!

1066
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:24,352
You are consoling me, Geet?

1067
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:28,213
I will just take a flight
and go away from all this!

1068
01:10:28,357 --> 01:10:29,415
What about you?

1069
01:10:29,758 --> 01:10:30,816
The way you are handling your life..

1070
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:32,224
..you can get into a
grave problem, Geet!

1071
01:10:32,294 --> 01:10:33,955
Do you realise that?

1072
01:10:34,763 --> 01:10:37,231
Life is not just about fun
and merriment, Geet!

1073
01:10:37,299 --> 01:10:39,426
You have to be serious in life too!

1074
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:42,761
Aditya, you were very
serious in life!

1075
01:10:43,839 --> 01:10:44,965
What was the use?

1076
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:47,903
You got into a grave trouble too!

1077
01:10:50,846 --> 01:10:52,245
What is going to happen
in the future..

1078
01:10:52,314 --> 01:10:54,373
..nobody can control that.

1079
01:10:54,783 --> 01:10:57,308
So I do what my heart tells me!

1080
01:10:57,853 --> 01:10:59,650
In the future I don't
want to blame anybody!

1081
01:11:00,322 --> 01:11:02,313
That my life got ruined
because of you!

1082
01:11:02,858 --> 01:11:04,257
No matter what my life becomes..

1083
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:06,655
I will know it's like
this because of me!

1084
01:11:06,729 --> 01:11:07,787
So I will be happy!

1085
01:11:10,799 --> 01:11:11,993
Too much philosophy, right?

1086
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:18,263
These moments.. which we
are spending together..

1087
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:20,672
..its really a lovely time.

1088
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:24,676
Just watch! In the future we
will remember this and laugh!

1089
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:46,300
I will return very soon!

1090
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:48,361
Soon as I get married
and with Anshuman..

1091
01:11:48,437 --> 01:11:50,302
..I will fall at their feet!

1092
01:11:51,907 --> 01:11:53,306
They will scold me, taunt me.

1093
01:11:54,843 --> 01:11:55,901
Then they will give their consent.

1094
01:11:58,514 --> 01:11:59,572
Let's go.

1095
01:12:00,716 --> 01:12:03,981
Tell me the truth. What
I am doing. Is it right?

1096
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:11,589
No! What you are doing is not right.

1097
01:12:13,529 --> 01:12:16,327
But you only had said.. that
when somebody is in love..

1098
01:12:16,398 --> 01:12:18,662
..there is no right or wrong.

1099
01:12:19,601 --> 01:12:20,659
All is fair.

1100
01:12:23,672 --> 01:12:28,336
And if today I can understand
my mother.. then don't worry.

1101
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:32,003
In the future your parents
will understand you.

1102
01:12:42,958 --> 01:12:44,016
Come on!

1103
01:13:05,647 --> 01:13:08,377
There is some reason.

1104
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:11,851
That I am enjoying
my life like this.

1105
01:13:13,856 --> 01:13:16,450
What is in the breeze?

1106
01:13:16,525 --> 01:13:19,926
That a slight intoxication
has entered me.

1107
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:25,388
Don't ask what has happened to me.

1108
01:13:25,467 --> 01:13:28,800
Coming in your path.

1109
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:32,397
Don't ask what I will get.

1110
01:13:32,808 --> 01:13:37,677
Coming in your arms.

1111
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:44,614
This love gives you
a glimpse of heaven.

1112
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:46,419
O God!

1113
01:13:46,488 --> 01:13:52,825
This love gives you
a glimpse of heaven.

1114
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:27,520
I have broken all the
bondages of the world.

1115
01:14:27,863 --> 01:14:30,525
I won't break my promise.

1116
01:14:31,066 --> 01:14:35,867
You are half the part of
the tale of my heart.

1117
01:14:35,938 --> 01:14:38,873
I am the other half, beloved.

1118
01:14:39,608 --> 01:14:43,066
Look, what has happened to me.

1119
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:47,673
Lost in your memories.

1120
01:14:47,883 --> 01:14:51,546
Don't ask what has happened to me.

1121
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:55,021
Living in your talks.

1122
01:14:55,624 --> 01:15:01,893
This love gives you
a glimpse of heaven.

1123
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:03,624
O God!

1124
01:15:03,699 --> 01:15:10,229
This love gives you
a glimpse of heaven.

1125
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:42,732
You must have found countless
like me, beloved.

1126
01:15:43,071 --> 01:15:45,801
But I found only you.

1127
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:50,945
You are the blossoming
smile on my lips.

1128
01:15:51,146 --> 01:15:53,944
My complaint is you too.

1129
01:15:54,950 --> 01:15:58,545
Look what has happened to me.

1130
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:01,748
Bringing you in my dreams.

1131
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:06,689
Don't ask what has happened to me.

1132
01:16:06,762 --> 01:16:10,698
Believing your talks.

1133
01:16:10,966 --> 01:16:17,303
This love gives you
a glimpse of heaven.

1134
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:18,972
O God!

1135
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:25,640
This love gives you
a glimpse of heaven.

1136
01:16:27,182 --> 01:16:29,776
There is some reason.

1137
01:16:30,118 --> 01:16:33,315
That's why I am enjoying
my life like this.

1138
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:37,987
What is in the breeze?

1139
01:16:38,193 --> 01:16:42,653
That a slight intoxication
has entered me.

1140
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:47,660
Don't ask what has happened to me.

1141
01:16:47,736 --> 01:16:50,796
Coming in your arms.

1142
01:16:51,807 --> 01:16:55,140
Don't ask what I will get.

1143
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:59,010
Coming in your arms.

1144
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:06,145
This love gives you
a glimpse of heaven.

1145
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:07,748
O God!

1146
01:17:07,823 --> 01:17:14,353
This love gives you
a glimpse of heaven.

1147
01:17:16,031 --> 01:17:22,698
This love gives you
a glimpse of heaven.

1148
01:17:24,172 --> 01:17:26,834
Look! Anshuman! Anshuman!

1149
01:17:27,909 --> 01:17:28,967
He is looking the other way!

1150
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:31,704
Come on!

1151
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:34,039
Bye, Geet!

1152
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:35,708
What?

1153
01:17:37,719 --> 01:17:38,777
Always be like this!

1154
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:41,782
At least meet him!

1155
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:51,724
Geet..

1156
01:17:58,206 --> 01:17:59,264
Take care!

1157
01:19:12,147 --> 01:19:14,479
Good morning.
- Good morning. - Good morning.

1158
01:19:17,285 --> 01:19:20,152
You are all not going to beat
me up together, right?

1159
01:19:21,890 --> 01:19:24,154
Mr. Mehra, please don't hit me.

1160
01:19:26,828 --> 01:19:28,762
I know I have done something
for which I should be beaten.

1161
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:29,956
I went without informing anyone..

1162
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:31,963
The company was already
in a bad condition.

1163
01:19:32,033 --> 01:19:33,762
And on top of that there
was me and my loneliness.

1164
01:19:35,303 --> 01:19:36,770
I know that there are
rumours spread..

1165
01:19:36,838 --> 01:19:37,896
..about me in the market.

1166
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:40,503
Aditya Kashyap cannot
replace his father..

1167
01:19:41,376 --> 01:19:42,502
The company is going to split.

1168
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:44,245
His girlfriend has married
someone else..

1169
01:19:44,312 --> 01:19:46,780
He has ran away from the city, etc.

1170
01:19:47,182 --> 01:19:52,176
These are all false rumours which
by the way are all true.

1171
01:19:55,123 --> 01:19:57,853
So our share prices are
at an all time low..

1172
01:19:57,926 --> 01:19:59,791
All our new brands have flopped.

1173
01:19:59,861 --> 01:20:01,385
On top of that 572 claims..

1174
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:04,789
In other words we are in
a very bad condition.

1175
01:20:04,866 --> 01:20:07,198
Sir, you are ruined. Nothing
can be worse than this.

1176
01:20:07,269 --> 01:20:09,203
So only good things can
happen and will happen.

1177
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:15,209
Man always gets what
he really wants.

1178
01:20:16,344 --> 01:20:21,407
And I really want to face
all these problems.

1179
01:20:21,950 --> 01:20:23,815
I want to complete all
the incomplete plans..

1180
01:20:24,152 --> 01:20:25,210
Take this company to such heights..

1181
01:20:25,287 --> 01:20:26,811
..which even dad could not imagine.

1182
01:20:29,157 --> 01:20:30,886
I know all of you loved dad a lot.

1183
01:20:33,428 --> 01:20:36,226
He is somewhere, watching us.

1184
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:41,234
So let us show him that
no need to be too proud.

1185
01:20:41,303 --> 01:20:43,032
This company can perform
without you.

1186
01:20:43,104 --> 01:20:44,833
And can perform better
than your expectations.

1187
01:20:44,906 --> 01:20:47,101
Let's show him. What do you say?

1188
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:06,055
Mrs. Khanna doesn't want to entertain
any settlement in this stage.

1189
01:21:07,262 --> 01:21:10,254
She is here only to honour the
request of this meeting.

1190
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:16,327
She thinks that Mr. Aditya has
behaved very inappropriately.

1191
01:21:16,471 --> 01:21:18,598
So there is no hope for negotiation.

1192
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:24,608
My God, you talk a lot. You
enjoy talking don't you?

1193
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:26,939
Do you know I have been
meeting people..

1194
01:21:27,015 --> 01:21:28,073
..just like you since
the last few days.

1195
01:21:28,149 --> 01:21:29,207
Excuse me.

1196
01:21:30,151 --> 01:21:33,018
This is your client's claim, right?
I am ready to sign it.

1197
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:35,288
Your work is over.

1198
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:38,086
Take it easy. Relax.
Take a chill pill.

1199
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:39,490
Listen, take care of sir.

1200
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:41,893
And listen, ask him what is
his monthly phone bill?

1201
01:21:41,963 --> 01:21:43,430
Sir, please.

1202
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:44,957
Mrs. Khanna.

1203
01:21:46,434 --> 01:21:48,163
It is your personal matter
what you have done..

1204
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:53,966
..with your family and husband
in your personal life.

1205
01:21:56,311 --> 01:21:58,108
This company is not
concerned with it.

1206
01:22:00,982 --> 01:22:03,450
For that reason, I can't take
away your life long hard work.

1207
01:22:05,453 --> 01:22:08,320
You and Mr. Kashyap had started
this company in a small room.

1208
01:22:10,058 --> 01:22:12,993
and after 30 years of hard work you
have made this company what it is.

1209
01:22:16,464 --> 01:22:22,994
No one can give you these 5 things.

1210
01:22:27,142 --> 01:22:29,076
This company belongs to you
as much as it belongs to me.

1211
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:34,939
And I want you to have the
same position, respect..

1212
01:22:35,016 --> 01:22:40,352
..and responsibilities you held
5 years ago. Is that okay?

1213
01:22:44,492 --> 01:22:45,550
Raghav, get the papers ready.

1214
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:47,151
I want to sign them in an hour.
- Sure!

1215
01:22:49,564 --> 01:22:50,622
Welcome back.

1216
01:22:58,506 --> 01:23:01,964
Sir, what is your STD bill.
- I don't want to discuss..

1217
01:23:02,043 --> 01:23:03,977
Listen, request an itemised bill.
It's very important.

1218
01:23:04,045 --> 01:23:05,103
Okay, sir.

1219
01:23:06,514 --> 01:23:09,244
Mehek.
- Yes, sir. Call our telecom team.

1220
01:23:09,317 --> 01:23:11,512
I have a new idea product idea.
ASAP. Okay. - Sir.

1221
01:23:11,586 --> 01:23:14,521
And what else I am afraid
of? Stake owners.

1222
01:23:14,589 --> 01:23:16,181
I want a meeting with the stake
owners tomorrow morning.

1223
01:23:16,257 --> 01:23:17,986
I just want to see the expression
on their faces..

1224
01:23:18,059 --> 01:23:19,390
..when they realise
that mom is back.

1225
01:23:19,461 --> 01:23:21,190
After that I will place my terms
with them. - Yes, sir.

1226
01:23:21,262 --> 01:23:23,526
Adi.
- Yes. What happened?

1227
01:23:23,598 --> 01:23:24,656
You tell me what has happened?

1228
01:23:25,533 --> 01:23:26,659
You went to Manali right.
- Yes.

1229
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:29,129
Did you pray to Lord
Shiva out there?

1230
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:33,065
Correct. You are right. - There
is something. And it is serious.

1231
01:23:33,141 --> 01:23:36,542
I fear that you will solve
all your problems this way.

1232
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:39,537
You are working more in a day then
you used to work in 6 months.

1233
01:23:40,615 --> 01:23:42,139
Don't you care about
your reputation?

1234
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:44,015
What's wrong with you, friend?

1235
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:48,421
What's wrong with me? How
can I forget? - What?

1236
01:23:49,290 --> 01:23:51,690
The most important work.
- Annual report. - No.

1237
01:23:52,627 --> 01:23:53,685
I will meet you.

1238
01:23:56,031 --> 01:23:57,089
Good morning.

1239
01:24:27,328 --> 01:24:33,198
Nothing is gained.

1240
01:24:34,669 --> 01:24:37,331
Nothing is lost.

1241
01:24:37,672 --> 01:24:46,080
Your absence is like..

1242
01:24:46,147 --> 01:24:55,146
..your presence.

1243
01:24:56,691 --> 01:24:59,819
The day starts with you.

1244
01:25:00,361 --> 01:25:03,489
The dusky evening approaches.

1245
01:25:03,698 --> 01:25:05,632
From you.

1246
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:07,361
From you.

1247
01:25:08,103 --> 01:25:10,833
Every moment, every breath

1248
01:25:11,506 --> 01:25:14,498
And the life that I have is

1249
01:25:14,776 --> 01:25:16,368
From you.

1250
01:25:16,711 --> 01:25:18,235
From you.

1251
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:25,376
Nothing is gained.

1252
01:25:26,454 --> 01:25:31,858
Nothing is lost.

1253
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:40,125
Your absence is..

1254
01:25:40,201 --> 01:25:46,333
..Iike your presence.

1255
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:07,219
My eyes stare into your eyes.

1256
01:26:07,629 --> 01:26:10,621
My arms are in your arms.

1257
01:26:11,232 --> 01:26:15,566
I have nothing of me in me.

1258
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:17,695
What happened?

1259
01:26:18,706 --> 01:26:21,903
My talks are filled
with your talks.

1260
01:26:22,377 --> 01:26:25,369
The nights are filled
with your stories.

1261
01:26:26,181 --> 01:26:30,311
Why has all this become yours?

1262
01:26:30,785 --> 01:26:32,309
What happened?

1263
01:26:32,787 --> 01:26:39,454
Wherever I go, I'm never far..

1264
01:26:39,794 --> 01:26:41,386
From you.

1265
01:26:41,663 --> 01:26:43,324
From you.

1266
01:26:43,798 --> 01:26:46,790
There is a silence in the bustle.

1267
01:26:47,669 --> 01:26:50,661
There is a little delirium.

1268
01:26:50,805 --> 01:26:52,329
From you.

1269
01:26:52,674 --> 01:26:54,403
From you.

1270
01:27:03,218 --> 01:27:05,948
Somewhere a half done promise.

1271
01:27:06,821 --> 01:27:09,813
Somewhere more than a half.

1272
01:27:10,491 --> 01:27:17,363
I feel like making
to you, of loyalty.

1273
01:27:17,832 --> 01:27:20,960
Can't leave it even if I want to.

1274
01:27:21,636 --> 01:27:24,571
Can't break it even if I want to.

1275
01:27:25,306 --> 01:27:31,506
The way I am connected
to you with loyalty.

1276
01:27:32,247 --> 01:27:35,307
I am what you made me.

1277
01:27:35,650 --> 01:27:38,642
Whatever I have become is.

1278
01:27:38,853 --> 01:27:40,514
From you.

1279
01:27:40,855 --> 01:27:42,447
From you.

1280
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:46,318
Roads meet.

1281
01:27:46,728 --> 01:27:49,663
Destinations are found.

1282
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:51,459
From you.

1283
01:27:51,866 --> 01:27:53,458
From you.

1284
01:27:54,669 --> 01:28:00,471
Nothing is gained.

1285
01:28:01,676 --> 01:28:06,545
Nothing is lost.

1286
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:15,280
Your absence is like..

1287
01:28:15,356 --> 01:28:21,818
..your presence.

1288
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:41,578
The country's first long distance
calling card, 'Geet'.

1289
01:28:42,850 --> 01:28:45,717
For people who like to talk more.

1290
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:48,718
Excuse me, sir, how did you get the
idea of the lndia calling card?

1291
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:51,519
The world is getting smaller
and lndia is becoming bigger.

1292
01:28:51,726 --> 01:28:53,318
We talk to the entire world today.

1293
01:28:53,528 --> 01:28:55,325
The idea is to let people
talk enough to..

1294
01:28:55,396 --> 01:28:56,454
..fill up their hearts,
not their bills.

1295
01:28:56,731 --> 01:28:58,323
We will call them up.
Doesn't really matter.

1296
01:28:58,399 --> 01:28:59,866
All that matters is that
the terms are met.

1297
01:28:59,934 --> 01:29:01,401
So please request him
tomorrow for a meeting.

1298
01:29:01,469 --> 01:29:02,527
Any time after lunch.

1299
01:29:02,603 --> 01:29:05,401
Excuse me.
- Who are you? - Excuse me.

1300
01:29:08,943 --> 01:29:12,743
One second. One second.
- Scoundrel! Rascal!

1301
01:29:14,349 --> 01:29:18,752
Sorry. Greetings. How are you?

1302
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:22,414
Where is she? Where is Geet?

1303
01:29:24,692 --> 01:29:26,091
Tell me. Why are you looking
at me like that?

1304
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:28,761
Tell me where she is.

1305
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:33,561
Call her here. We need
to talk to her.

1306
01:29:35,503 --> 01:29:41,442
Uncle, Geet is not with me.
- Go away. Stop doing this drama..

1307
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:44,106
We met by chance in a train.

1308
01:29:44,379 --> 01:29:46,779
We didn't even know
each other before.

1309
01:29:47,382 --> 01:29:48,906
Manjeet has told us everything.

1310
01:29:48,983 --> 01:29:51,451
He has seen you and Geet together.

1311
01:29:53,988 --> 01:29:56,388
Roop has also seen you
eloping with her.

1312
01:29:56,991 --> 01:30:00,518
Still you are denying. Are we fools?

1313
01:30:02,530 --> 01:30:05,397
Uncle, I know what you think but..

1314
01:30:05,466 --> 01:30:08,401
Pick up the phone and call her
here. Pick up the phone.

1315
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:12,873
Let me explain..
- Look.

1316
01:30:13,007 --> 01:30:15,407
Everything was explained
when you launched..

1317
01:30:15,476 --> 01:30:17,876
..the calling card with
her name, Geet.

1318
01:30:18,413 --> 01:30:21,541
Didn't you announce it to
the entire world? Speak up!

1319
01:30:24,018 --> 01:30:25,076
Trying to fool me.

1320
01:30:27,688 --> 01:30:30,486
Uncle, listen to me please.
- Listen to me son.

1321
01:30:31,025 --> 01:30:33,823
Everyone knows that you left
for Bhatinda together.

1322
01:30:34,429 --> 01:30:36,090
And now you are saying that
she is not with you.

1323
01:30:36,431 --> 01:30:37,489
Tell me the truth.

1324
01:30:37,632 --> 01:30:39,099
Tell me, has something
happened to her?

1325
01:30:39,967 --> 01:30:42,629
Is she no longer alive?
Tell me son, tell me.

1326
01:30:42,837 --> 01:30:43,895
What are you saying, uncle?

1327
01:30:43,971 --> 01:30:46,906
Because Geet not talking to us
for 9 months is not possible.

1328
01:30:47,775 --> 01:30:49,834
9 months. I know something
has happened.

1329
01:30:50,178 --> 01:30:51,509
She couldn't even wait for 9 hours.

1330
01:30:51,579 --> 01:30:54,980
Uncle, nothing has happened
to Geet. She is fine.

1331
01:30:56,651 --> 01:30:57,709
How do you know?

1332
01:30:59,654 --> 01:31:02,851
I know. Uncle, Geet
is absolutely fine.

1333
01:31:03,858 --> 01:31:04,916
Nothing has happened to her.

1334
01:31:05,059 --> 01:31:07,186
This means she is with you, right.

1335
01:31:08,930 --> 01:31:09,988
She is with you, isn't it?

1336
01:31:12,733 --> 01:31:17,466
Yes, she is with me.
- See. Call her here.

1337
01:31:17,805 --> 01:31:22,538
We need to talk to her now.
- She is not in Mumbai now.

1338
01:31:22,610 --> 01:31:25,602
Well done. You'll say it
and we'll believe it?

1339
01:31:26,013 --> 01:31:28,208
Yes. Believe it.

1340
01:31:29,484 --> 01:31:32,009
Uncle, I will bring Geet home.

1341
01:31:32,086 --> 01:31:33,144
When?

1342
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:38,687
In 10 days. - We won't leave
this place. 10 days indeed.

1343
01:31:39,694 --> 01:31:43,095
I promise you uncle; in 10 days
I will bring Geet to Bhatinda.

1344
01:31:43,831 --> 01:31:47,892
All right, I will wait. - Brother,
it is nothing but a waste of time.

1345
01:31:47,969 --> 01:31:49,027
He is fooling us.

1346
01:31:49,504 --> 01:31:53,099
10 days?
- Yes.

1347
01:32:04,519 --> 01:32:07,113
Should I ask you or
can you read my mind?

1348
01:32:09,790 --> 01:32:10,848
I am going to Manali.

1349
01:32:41,287 --> 01:32:43,221
Sir.
- Thank you.

1350
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:48,291
Anshuman.
- Yes.

1351
01:32:50,230 --> 01:32:51,288
Hi, I am Aditya.

1352
01:32:52,232 --> 01:32:54,894
We have never met but you
may have heard about me.

1353
01:32:55,435 --> 01:32:56,493
Aditya Kashyap.

1354
01:32:57,237 --> 01:33:01,833
- Aditya Kashyap. Aditya Kashyap.

1355
01:33:02,909 --> 01:33:06,310
By the way I have also heard a
lot about you from same source.

1356
01:33:06,713 --> 01:33:09,910
A small gift for you and
your family. - Thank you.

1357
01:33:10,650 --> 01:33:11,708
Please.
- Thank you.

1358
01:33:15,388 --> 01:33:16,446
So?

1359
01:33:18,591 --> 01:33:22,652
Actually Geet's family
is a little worried.

1360
01:33:23,263 --> 01:33:26,460
She said that you guys will return
to Bhatinda after getting married.

1361
01:33:26,532 --> 01:33:29,399
But I guess it never happened

1362
01:33:30,870 --> 01:33:31,928
Who?

1363
01:33:33,339 --> 01:33:34,397
What?

1364
01:33:34,474 --> 01:33:36,271
Who told you that after marriage..

1365
01:33:37,744 --> 01:33:38,802
Geet.

1366
01:33:39,012 --> 01:33:40,274
Which Geet are you talking about?

1367
01:33:45,285 --> 01:33:46,343
How many Geets do you know, friend?

1368
01:33:47,687 --> 01:33:48,881
I don't know any Geet.

1369
01:33:53,293 --> 01:33:54,351
Geet.

1370
01:34:01,768 --> 01:34:02,826
Take care.

1371
01:34:11,778 --> 01:34:16,306
You have.. How Anshuman?

1372
01:34:18,851 --> 01:34:19,909
How can you do this?

1373
01:34:20,853 --> 01:34:22,320
Don't make me feel guilty.

1374
01:34:23,056 --> 01:34:25,650
I didn't tell her to run away
from home. Understand?

1375
01:34:26,326 --> 01:34:27,918
Still she came to
meet you, Anshuman.

1376
01:34:29,062 --> 01:34:31,997
After leaving her entire
world behind. Why?

1377
01:34:32,065 --> 01:34:35,330
Because she is crazy.
You know her..

1378
01:34:35,668 --> 01:34:38,398
So you would know that
she is very childish.

1379
01:34:38,738 --> 01:34:39,932
She lives in a world of dreams.

1380
01:34:40,473 --> 01:34:42,600
She thinks that everything will
happen the way she wants.

1381
01:34:45,545 --> 01:34:47,877
And you proved to her that her
world of dreams doesn't exist.

1382
01:34:48,881 --> 01:34:50,348
Because people like you live here.

1383
01:34:51,351 --> 01:34:55,685
Look sir, you are a very big man.
But this my personal issue.

1384
01:34:56,089 --> 01:34:57,818
I don't think I need to
explain anything to you.

1385
01:34:58,825 --> 01:34:59,883
Right.

1386
01:35:01,361 --> 01:35:03,693
What is there to explain after
what you have done to her?

1387
01:35:04,497 --> 01:35:05,555
Everything is clear.

1388
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:09,364
But its not clear why
you are doing here?

1389
01:35:10,570 --> 01:35:12,367
Geet never said that she knew you..

1390
01:35:12,438 --> 01:35:14,633
..but still you came
so far looking for her.

1391
01:35:15,775 --> 01:35:16,833
What's the scene, mister?

1392
01:35:24,384 --> 01:35:26,716
I would have told you what the scene
between me and Geet is Anshuman.

1393
01:35:28,388 --> 01:35:30,652
But a cheap man like you
will never understand it.

1394
01:35:31,391 --> 01:35:37,660
What? What did you say?
- Cheap. Bad. Lowly.

1395
01:35:40,133 --> 01:35:41,395
What bad have I done?

1396
01:35:42,535 --> 01:35:44,400
You are speaking as if I had
promised her marriage..

1397
01:35:44,470 --> 01:35:45,528
..and taken advantage of her.

1398
01:35:46,406 --> 01:35:47,805
I had not even mentioned marriage.

1399
01:35:48,808 --> 01:35:49,866
She was crazy about it.

1400
01:35:50,543 --> 01:35:53,410
We will do this and that after
marriage. This house.

1401
01:35:53,546 --> 01:35:57,141
Such a balcony. Such curtains. Fool!

1402
01:35:59,819 --> 01:36:02,014
I told her to go back to Bhatinda.

1403
01:36:02,622 --> 01:36:04,886
I used to tell her the same when
she used to call me from Shimla.

1404
01:36:05,425 --> 01:36:08,417
But she never listened
to me. Then go ahead.

1405
01:36:08,494 --> 01:36:09,552
It makes no difference to me.

1406
01:36:09,629 --> 01:36:12,427
Geet has not come home since
the last 9 months, Anshuman.

1407
01:36:12,765 --> 01:36:13,823
She is alone somewhere.

1408
01:36:14,167 --> 01:36:17,432
Who knows how she is and
in what condition.

1409
01:36:17,570 --> 01:36:19,094
And just because you refused her.

1410
01:36:21,574 --> 01:36:23,098
And if it doesn't make any
difference to you, Anshuman.

1411
01:36:23,976 --> 01:36:25,034
Then that is right for her.

1412
01:36:25,711 --> 01:36:28,976
She should be punished that she
loved a man like you so much.

1413
01:36:31,784 --> 01:36:32,842
Anshuman.

1414
01:37:11,491 --> 01:37:16,155
When you will come, darling.

1415
01:37:19,232 --> 01:37:24,033
When you will come, darling.

1416
01:37:25,505 --> 01:37:29,498
Flowers will bloom in the garden.

1417
01:37:31,511 --> 01:37:33,502
It will rain.

1418
01:37:35,248 --> 01:37:40,117
It will rain heavily.

1419
01:37:41,521 --> 01:37:45,582
The two hearts will
meet like this.

1420
01:37:47,260 --> 01:37:52,197
When you will come, darling.

1421
01:37:53,533 --> 01:37:57,663
Flowers will bloom in the garden.

1422
01:38:32,838 --> 01:38:35,830
Your eyes are filled with kohl.

1423
01:38:36,776 --> 01:38:39,711
I am smitten by your eyes,

1424
01:38:40,846 --> 01:38:47,843
These strange eyes of yours
had made many promises.

1425
01:38:49,789 --> 01:38:53,122
The whiff of breath blows softly.

1426
01:38:53,926 --> 01:38:57,589
When they stop it will rain.

1427
01:38:59,599 --> 01:39:04,127
It will rain heavily.

1428
01:39:05,605 --> 01:39:09,598
The two hearts will
meet like this.

1429
01:39:11,344 --> 01:39:16,145
When you will come, darling.

1430
01:39:17,216 --> 01:39:21,619
Flowers will bloom in the garden.

1431
01:39:56,188 --> 01:39:58,315
Mi So So Do Do Re Do.

1432
01:40:02,928 --> 01:40:05,863
In the night filled
with moon and stars.

1433
01:40:06,999 --> 01:40:09,934
My life is in your hands now.

1434
01:40:10,936 --> 01:40:13,996
There are twinkling
stars in my eyes.

1435
01:40:14,940 --> 01:40:17,875
With rain filled with hailstorms.

1436
01:40:18,277 --> 01:40:24,273
The world of dreams
will be blooming.

1437
01:40:25,418 --> 01:40:27,682
It will rain.

1438
01:40:29,422 --> 01:40:34,155
It will rain heavily.

1439
01:40:35,761 --> 01:40:39,697
The two hearts will
meet like this.

1440
01:41:07,727 --> 01:41:12,255
So Ti La So Fa Mi, La,
La, La Mi Re.

1441
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:19,061
Ti Re Mi Re Ti La Ti
Re Fa Fa La Ti Do.

1442
01:41:22,475 --> 01:41:25,000
Sa Ti La So Fa Fa.

1443
01:41:25,344 --> 01:41:28,745
Fa Fa Re Fa Mi.

1444
01:41:33,953 --> 01:41:40,358
Hi. What a surprise? What
are you doing here?

1445
01:41:42,161 --> 01:41:44,493
Just like that. I came to
know you are here so..

1446
01:41:45,498 --> 01:41:50,959
So how are you?
- Good. - Yes? - Yes.

1447
01:41:52,238 --> 01:41:54,172
Great. And the rest?

1448
01:41:55,775 --> 01:41:56,833
And the rest is all fine.

1449
01:41:59,779 --> 01:42:00,905
You have hurt me a lot Geet.

1450
01:42:06,118 --> 01:42:11,055
Couldn't you tell me? Couldn't
you call me up once?

1451
01:42:13,926 --> 01:42:15,985
Pack your luggage and come with me.

1452
01:42:18,798 --> 01:42:19,856
Go away, Aditya.

1453
01:42:20,399 --> 01:42:21,866
Look Geet, I am very angry now.

1454
01:42:22,802 --> 01:42:25,066
Don't make me angrier,
all right? Come on.

1455
01:42:26,272 --> 01:42:27,330
No, Aditya.

1456
01:42:28,541 --> 01:42:32,807
I will stay in the
life I have made for me.

1457
01:42:33,145 --> 01:42:34,203
You know what Geet.

1458
01:42:34,814 --> 01:42:37,806
Keep your fable stories
philosophy with you.

1459
01:42:37,950 --> 01:42:39,008
Right now you are coming with me.

1460
01:42:40,286 --> 01:42:41,947
You cannot force me, Aditya.

1461
01:42:42,021 --> 01:42:43,079
Of course I can Geet.

1462
01:42:45,891 --> 01:42:48,416
Geet you are coming with me.
- Damn it, Aditya, let me go.

1463
01:42:48,828 --> 01:42:50,955
What are you doing? I
told you, let me go.

1464
01:42:51,030 --> 01:42:52,224
Get listen to me, you
are coming with..

1465
01:42:52,298 --> 01:42:53,822
Who do you think you are?

1466
01:42:55,835 --> 01:42:57,826
Just because this happened
to me it doesn't mean..

1467
01:42:57,903 --> 01:42:59,097
..that it's your chance
now. Understand?

1468
01:43:03,442 --> 01:43:05,842
I understood. I will
keep that in mind.

1469
01:43:06,846 --> 01:43:07,904
Can we leave now?

1470
01:43:10,249 --> 01:43:12,046
Why are you doing all this?

1471
01:43:12,451 --> 01:43:14,112
It is not necessary to tell
you the reason, Geet.

1472
01:43:14,186 --> 01:43:15,312
Fetch your luggage and let's go.

1473
01:43:17,189 --> 01:43:23,389
No, Aditya, I can't take
more favours from you.

1474
01:43:25,331 --> 01:43:28,061
You have already done a lot
for me. So just forget it.

1475
01:43:30,469 --> 01:43:34,872
I have done a lot for you.
I have done a lot for you.

1476
01:43:36,008 --> 01:43:38,340
I am alive today just because
of you. You fool.

1477
01:43:40,212 --> 01:43:42,612
This is my second life which
you have given me.

1478
01:43:43,549 --> 01:43:44,880
Do you know how successful
I am today?

1479
01:43:45,618 --> 01:43:48,416
Today my company is at a higher
position than at dad's time.

1480
01:43:48,888 --> 01:43:51,550
I have started 3 new industries,
launched many brands.

1481
01:43:51,624 --> 01:43:53,091
Everything is going great.

1482
01:43:53,225 --> 01:43:55,887
And what I am today is just
because of you, Geet.

1483
01:43:57,496 --> 01:43:59,896
Whenever I am in a problem
I used to think..

1484
01:43:59,965 --> 01:44:02,024
..what would Geet do if she
were here and I do that.

1485
01:44:02,601 --> 01:44:03,898
And you..

1486
01:44:06,972 --> 01:44:08,906
Shall we go now or do you
want some more drama?

1487
01:44:09,174 --> 01:44:10,505
This is my life. Go away from here.

1488
01:44:10,576 --> 01:44:11,907
Leave me alone, etc.

1489
01:44:20,252 --> 01:44:21,310
I am coming.

1490
01:44:42,942 --> 01:44:44,000
Take out the luggage.

1491
01:44:58,557 --> 01:45:02,357
So, you stay here, I will
take another room.

1492
01:45:03,495 --> 01:45:06,293
What is the need? It
is such a big room.

1493
01:45:09,435 --> 01:45:12,962
All right. Anyways I know karate.

1494
01:45:13,706 --> 01:45:14,968
So there shouldn't be any problem.

1495
01:45:17,643 --> 01:45:22,239
Don't worry, I won't rape you.
- You can't.

1496
01:45:23,315 --> 01:45:25,715
I don't want to rape you.
- Even if you want to you can't.

1497
01:45:29,655 --> 01:45:33,591
My God. What a night it was.
Do you remember that hotel?

1498
01:45:33,659 --> 01:45:37,459
Yes, hotel Decent.

1499
01:45:39,999 --> 01:45:41,057
- Decent.

1500
01:45:42,001 --> 01:45:43,059
By the way let me
tell you one thing.

1501
01:45:44,003 --> 01:45:45,994
That night everyone
in hotel Decent..

1502
01:45:46,071 --> 01:45:48,005
..thought you to be a call girl.

1503
01:45:48,273 --> 01:45:52,733
What? Call girl!
- I was going to use a worse word.

1504
01:45:53,012 --> 01:45:55,071
What nonsense? Really?

1505
01:45:55,614 --> 01:45:59,414
Remember when I told you that
let me talk but you were you.

1506
01:45:59,718 --> 01:46:05,486
Oh dear! Oh God! I was such
a fool.

1507
01:46:07,092 --> 01:46:09,026
What a fool I was.

1508
01:46:11,030 --> 01:46:12,361
That's why all this
is happening to me.

1509
01:46:15,034 --> 01:46:16,365
That's why I am in such a condition.

1510
01:46:22,307 --> 01:46:28,246
What have I done?
Where am I trapped?

1511
01:46:32,785 --> 01:46:37,051
I always keep on thinking
of what I should do next.

1512
01:46:39,124 --> 01:46:40,716
What do I tell him that he agrees?

1513
01:46:45,064 --> 01:46:46,122
I don't understand.

1514
01:46:50,069 --> 01:46:51,730
I used to call him a lot.

1515
01:47:08,754 --> 01:47:10,085
I will tell you what you should do.

1516
01:47:10,556 --> 01:47:12,615
Throw Anshuman out of
your life. Understand?

1517
01:47:14,693 --> 01:47:17,628
No matter how much you cry,
he won't come back Geet.

1518
01:47:18,097 --> 01:47:20,497
He would have returned long
back if he wanted to.

1519
01:47:20,833 --> 01:47:22,767
Geet he is not even
thinking about you.

1520
01:47:22,835 --> 01:47:24,097
He is happy in his life.

1521
01:47:28,373 --> 01:47:29,431
You met him?

1522
01:47:30,309 --> 01:47:31,367
Yes.

1523
01:47:31,443 --> 01:47:32,501
What was he saying?

1524
01:47:39,785 --> 01:47:44,381
Geet, Anshuman's chapter is over.

1525
01:47:46,258 --> 01:47:51,195
That is the truth. And it is
good for you to believe it.

1526
01:47:53,265 --> 01:47:57,133
The way he threw you out of his life,
just throw him out of your life.

1527
01:47:58,804 --> 01:48:00,863
Photograph. His photograph.

1528
01:48:01,206 --> 01:48:03,800
Burn his photograph and throw
him out of your life.

1529
01:48:04,143 --> 01:48:07,135
Give me his photo.
- I don't have one. - Shit.

1530
01:48:09,748 --> 01:48:13,479
Okay, we will call him and you
will abuse him. Even better.

1531
01:48:13,619 --> 01:48:17,749
Abuse him all you want.
- Aditya please.

1532
01:48:17,823 --> 01:48:22,487
It is childish? Great,
be childish. Abuse him.

1533
01:48:22,761 --> 01:48:25,161
Take out your anger. You
will feel fantastic.

1534
01:48:26,832 --> 01:48:27,890
Listen.

1535
01:48:31,303 --> 01:48:34,295
Aditya, listen. Aditya.

1536
01:48:36,441 --> 01:48:39,501
It is ringing. Get ready. Abuse
him all you want, okay?

1537
01:48:39,578 --> 01:48:44,174
Please. - Hello. - Hello.
Anshuman? One second.

1538
01:48:46,919 --> 01:48:50,184
Come on. Come on just go for it.
- Hello? - Come on.

1539
01:48:52,724 --> 01:48:53,850
Hello.
- Yes.

1540
01:48:55,527 --> 01:48:56,585
Hello, Anshuman?

1541
01:48:57,196 --> 01:48:58,254
Geet?

1542
01:48:58,330 --> 01:48:59,456
Yes.
- Abuse him.

1543
01:48:59,798 --> 01:49:01,925
Was that Aditya Kashyap's voice?

1544
01:49:02,334 --> 01:49:05,929
Yes.
- Hello. - Come on.

1545
01:49:06,605 --> 01:49:09,540
Anshuman, I wanted to say that..
- Tell me, Geet.

1546
01:49:10,676 --> 01:49:14,271
Don't think. Don't think. Just
say it. - Hello. - Dog. - Yes.

1547
01:49:14,613 --> 01:49:15,671
What?

1548
01:49:17,416 --> 01:49:22,820
Dog. Fool! - Hello, Geet. -
Fantastic. - You scoundrel.

1549
01:49:22,888 --> 01:49:26,221
Fantastic!
- You child of a pig.

1550
01:49:27,292 --> 01:49:30,284
Did you think that I will suffer for
you my entire life if you leave me?

1551
01:49:30,762 --> 01:49:31,956
You will suffer, you rascal.
- Geet!

1552
01:49:32,231 --> 01:49:35,223
Worms will eat you. You
will die a dog's death

1553
01:49:35,634 --> 01:49:38,899
And after dying you will roast
in hell fire forever, rascal.

1554
01:49:46,245 --> 01:49:47,303
Are you feeling better?

1555
01:49:49,248 --> 01:49:50,306
Yes. - Yes.

1556
01:49:50,449 --> 01:49:51,507
I am feeling very nice.

1557
01:49:54,786 --> 01:49:55,844
Thanks.

1558
01:49:56,788 --> 01:49:57,846
Any time.

1559
01:50:48,307 --> 01:50:51,572
It is okay. It happens sometimes.

1560
01:50:52,511 --> 01:50:55,503
It won't happen in the future.
Nothing to worry about.

1561
01:50:56,381 --> 01:50:59,509
I am very hungry. What is
there to eat? I will see.

1562
01:51:14,733 --> 01:51:16,325
And tomorrow you will take me
around Shimla, understand?

1563
01:51:18,937 --> 01:51:21,337
Don't be embarrassed, friend.
What has happened?

1564
01:51:21,473 --> 01:51:24,067
Nothing. Come. Let's eat something.

1565
01:51:24,343 --> 01:51:26,538
Tomorrow we have to go out. Come.

1566
01:51:29,014 --> 01:51:31,414
What have you ordered? Is
this something to eat?

1567
01:51:31,817 --> 01:51:34,615
You could have ordered
cottage cheese, fries.

1568
01:51:35,554 --> 01:51:36,885
Or could have ordered
chick peas and bread.

1569
01:51:37,022 --> 01:51:38,080
You are crazy.

1570
01:52:06,785 --> 01:52:07,911
Come on let's go. We
will miss the train.

1571
01:52:09,388 --> 01:52:10,446
Hurry up, Geet, hurry.

1572
01:52:19,398 --> 01:52:20,456
Give me your hand.

1573
01:52:24,536 --> 01:52:27,403
You know, for many months
I have had nightmares

1574
01:52:27,806 --> 01:52:30,138
That I am running after
a train and I missed it.

1575
01:52:30,742 --> 01:52:33,404
You have caught it now.
- Yes. - Come. Come.

1576
01:52:43,021 --> 01:52:44,488
You like me a lot, don't you?

1577
01:52:46,425 --> 01:52:52,830
A lot. I like you a lot.
But that is my problem.

1578
01:52:54,633 --> 01:52:57,625
Anyone can feel the way
they want to. Correct?

1579
01:53:01,506 --> 01:53:04,498
You don't have to worry
about it at all. Okay?

1580
01:53:07,179 --> 01:53:08,441
Okay?

1581
01:53:29,534 --> 01:53:32,128
Geet, we will leave for Bhatinda
in a little while.

1582
01:53:34,473 --> 01:53:39,206
No.
- Yes. - How will I face them?

1583
01:53:39,544 --> 01:53:41,478
You don't have to face them.
You just have to return home.

1584
01:53:42,013 --> 01:53:43,071
Come on.

1585
01:53:59,498 --> 01:54:03,696
May I talk to you?
- What is the matter? - 2 minutes.

1586
01:54:09,107 --> 01:54:10,574
There is no use of talking now.

1587
01:54:10,775 --> 01:54:12,640
Please Geet. Let's go somewhere.

1588
01:54:13,912 --> 01:54:15,174
I don't want to talk to you.

1589
01:54:15,647 --> 01:54:17,512
I have made a mistake. Okay.

1590
01:54:18,049 --> 01:54:19,914
I didn't have enough courage
to take you home.

1591
01:54:20,986 --> 01:54:22,510
Since the last 9 months
I have been acting..

1592
01:54:22,587 --> 01:54:23,986
..as if I am very strong
and practical.

1593
01:54:24,589 --> 01:54:25,715
Whatever I did was right.

1594
01:54:26,124 --> 01:54:28,524
But the truth is you arrived
suddenly that day..

1595
01:54:28,593 --> 01:54:31,255
..and I couldn't handle
it. I was scared.

1596
01:54:31,730 --> 01:54:33,595
Mummy, papa, society, religion.

1597
01:54:34,065 --> 01:54:36,533
But to hell with everything today.

1598
01:54:37,202 --> 01:54:38,533
It makes no difference to me now.

1599
01:54:40,539 --> 01:54:42,006
You leave me alone helpless one day.

1600
01:54:43,675 --> 01:54:46,803
And you come after 9 months and
say that I committed a mistake.

1601
01:54:48,547 --> 01:54:49,673
It's so easy, isn't it?

1602
01:54:49,948 --> 01:54:54,612
No, it is very hard. But
now I will make it easy.

1603
01:54:55,754 --> 01:54:58,621
You have gone through a lot. Now
all your problems are mine.

1604
01:54:59,558 --> 01:55:02,891
Let's go to Bhatinda. I will
talk to mummy and papa.

1605
01:55:03,562 --> 01:55:06,156
I will explain it to them. I will
make everything fine, Geet.

1606
01:55:06,965 --> 01:55:08,023
Everything will be fine.

1607
01:55:18,109 --> 01:55:20,771
Why did he have to come now?
Everything was fine.

1608
01:55:22,113 --> 01:55:26,777
It is too late. Nothing can
happen now. It is too late.

1609
01:55:30,589 --> 01:55:35,185
You know Geet my parents
didn't love each other.

1610
01:55:37,662 --> 01:55:38,993
Both of them used to
love other people.

1611
01:55:42,067 --> 01:55:44,001
And because of that I was
pained my entire life.

1612
01:55:46,304 --> 01:55:50,331
They were very good with each
other at work but at home..

1613
01:55:53,612 --> 01:55:58,208
I always used to ask myself,
why did they got married?

1614
01:56:03,622 --> 01:56:05,214
They should have listened
to their heart, Geet.

1615
01:56:08,226 --> 01:56:09,750
And one day everything
would have been fine.

1616
01:56:15,634 --> 01:56:16,965
Just listen to your heart, Geet.

1617
01:56:19,237 --> 01:56:22,638
And everything will be fine.
- What do you mean?

1618
01:56:26,645 --> 01:56:30,638
No one will remember these 9 months..

1619
01:56:30,715 --> 01:56:33,650
..after many years pass by.

1620
01:56:36,254 --> 01:56:37,312
Really Aditya.

1621
01:56:38,857 --> 01:56:43,317
I never imagined you
would take his side.

1622
01:56:48,133 --> 01:56:49,657
I am also taking your side, Geet.

1623
01:56:51,936 --> 01:56:55,736
You and Anshuman are
on the same side.

1624
01:56:58,743 --> 01:56:59,801
It's simple Geet.

1625
01:57:01,746 --> 01:57:05,682
Those who love each other
should remain together.

1626
01:57:07,686 --> 01:57:08,744
Only then everyone will be happy.

1627
01:57:11,423 --> 01:57:12,685
And you?

1628
01:57:16,695 --> 01:57:18,959
Have your first extra
marital affair with me

1629
01:57:19,898 --> 01:57:20,956
Then I will also be happy.

1630
01:57:25,437 --> 01:57:26,699
Sure. Done.

1631
01:57:26,771 --> 01:57:27,829
Done.

1632
01:57:34,913 --> 01:57:35,971
No, Aditya.

1633
01:57:38,450 --> 01:57:39,781
This is not right.

1634
01:57:41,853 --> 01:57:42,911
I wish.

1635
01:57:46,725 --> 01:57:47,783
I wish it was not right.

1636
01:57:51,129 --> 01:57:52,187
But..

1637
01:57:56,201 --> 01:57:58,260
Come on. Come on.

1638
01:58:43,515 --> 01:58:44,777
This evening. Today!

1639
01:58:46,251 --> 01:58:50,187
You are bringing her. You are
bringing Geet. At what time?

1640
01:58:51,389 --> 01:58:55,917
All right, in the evening. All
right dear. We will wait.

1641
01:58:57,295 --> 01:58:58,353
Okay.

1642
01:59:16,815 --> 01:59:17,873
Best of luck.

1643
01:59:26,357 --> 01:59:27,415
What is happening here?

1644
01:59:29,227 --> 01:59:30,558
Their girl is returning
home after 9 months.

1645
01:59:53,451 --> 01:59:54,509
Dear!

1646
01:59:55,854 --> 01:59:56,912
Are you all right?

1647
01:59:57,522 --> 01:59:58,580
Come.

1648
01:59:59,591 --> 02:00:00,853
Son!

1649
02:00:02,594 --> 02:00:05,859
I didn't believe that you
will bring our Geet here.

1650
02:00:06,397 --> 02:00:09,924
But by proving me wrong,
you have won my heart.

1651
02:00:10,201 --> 02:00:11,862
You have made me happy! Thank you!
- God has blessed us!

1652
02:00:12,337 --> 02:00:13,531
Come, my dear; come.

1653
02:00:14,205 --> 02:00:15,263
Greetings, grandma!

1654
02:00:15,340 --> 02:00:17,274
Thank God, my daughter
has come to her house!

1655
02:00:17,342 --> 02:00:18,866
Here he is!
- Greetings.

1656
02:00:19,878 --> 02:00:20,936
Very good.

1657
02:00:21,012 --> 02:00:22,070
Very good.

1658
02:00:25,350 --> 02:00:26,408
Well, brother-in-law!

1659
02:00:29,888 --> 02:00:31,082
After all, the secret could
not be kept hidden!

1660
02:00:34,626 --> 02:00:37,220
Oh! Now you can't even
keep your eyes off her?

1661
02:00:37,929 --> 02:00:38,987
Just wait!

1662
02:00:45,436 --> 02:00:46,562
Here! Are you happy now?

1663
02:00:49,908 --> 02:00:50,966
May you be protected
against evil eyes!

1664
02:00:51,042 --> 02:00:53,169
Really, they are made
for each other!

1665
02:00:54,913 --> 02:00:55,971
Shannu, take this.

1666
02:00:57,515 --> 02:00:58,573
Listen, mother!

1667
02:01:00,518 --> 02:01:01,576
Come!

1668
02:01:02,253 --> 02:01:04,915
Hey, look! Someone is
sitting in the car!

1669
02:01:06,658 --> 02:01:08,250
Come. Welcome! Welcome!

1670
02:01:08,326 --> 02:01:10,260
Do not feel shy, this
is a Punjabi household!

1671
02:01:11,262 --> 02:01:12,320
Is he your friend?

1672
02:01:12,664 --> 02:01:13,926
Aunt, take this.

1673
02:01:14,399 --> 02:01:15,923
Have this sweet.

1674
02:01:17,669 --> 02:01:19,660
Do not eat the whole piece;
leave a little.

1675
02:01:20,672 --> 02:01:21,934
Dear, you also eat.
- Mother!

1676
02:01:22,006 --> 02:01:24,338
Eat it. Love strengthens by
eating each other's leftover.

1677
02:01:26,477 --> 02:01:27,535
I think we should tell them.

1678
02:01:27,612 --> 02:01:28,670
Hey, what's going on?
What's going on?

1679
02:01:29,080 --> 02:01:30,604
Brother-in-law, control yourself!

1680
02:01:31,549 --> 02:01:34,609
Oh, I am floored! What a smile!

1681
02:01:35,954 --> 02:01:37,216
Shut up, you devil!

1682
02:01:37,689 --> 02:01:38,951
Don't trouble them!

1683
02:01:39,624 --> 02:01:41,023
Mother!
- Come, dear. Come inside.

1684
02:01:41,225 --> 02:01:42,283
Come. Come.

1685
02:01:42,360 --> 02:01:43,418
One minute.

1686
02:01:43,695 --> 02:01:44,957
'Come.'

1687
02:01:45,029 --> 02:01:46,553
'Come. Come.'

1688
02:01:48,666 --> 02:01:49,963
Hey, not like this!

1689
02:01:50,435 --> 02:01:53,097
You left holding hands; you will
have to enter holding hands too.

1690
02:01:54,973 --> 02:01:57,373
Hey, you are feeling very shy today!

1691
02:02:01,512 --> 02:02:02,979
That's more like it! Come in!

1692
02:02:07,986 --> 02:02:09,453
Mother, I want to
tell you something.

1693
02:02:09,520 --> 02:02:11,647
Dear, go and meet grandpa.
- Please! Now!

1694
02:02:12,256 --> 02:02:13,450
Dear, he is waiting for you.

1695
02:02:13,725 --> 02:02:15,989
You have to meet many people;
there is a long queue!

1696
02:02:16,260 --> 02:02:17,318
Take them along.

1697
02:02:18,463 --> 02:02:19,521
Brother-in-law, come.

1698
02:02:26,004 --> 02:02:27,062
Greetings, grandpa!

1699
02:02:27,138 --> 02:02:28,196
One minute.

1700
02:02:29,207 --> 02:02:30,265
One minute.

1701
02:02:32,210 --> 02:02:35,008
When I saw him for the first
time, I had understood.

1702
02:02:35,413 --> 02:02:38,007
At my age, one glance
is enough to realise..

1703
02:02:38,082 --> 02:02:41,677
..what is going on between
boy and girl.

1704
02:02:43,154 --> 02:02:45,679
I had asked you. You lied.

1705
02:02:46,357 --> 02:02:48,689
And eloping must have
been your idea.

1706
02:02:50,028 --> 02:02:51,086
Isn't it?

1707
02:02:51,629 --> 02:02:52,687
Isn't it?

1708
02:02:54,098 --> 02:02:56,089
Do you see? I knew it.

1709
02:02:56,701 --> 02:02:58,100
Among the two, she
is the naughty one.

1710
02:03:00,571 --> 02:03:04,029
Anyway a mistake can be
forgiven only once.

1711
02:03:05,043 --> 02:03:06,101
You have committed your mistake..

1712
02:03:06,177 --> 02:03:07,576
..you have been granted
your pardon too.

1713
02:03:08,446 --> 02:03:12,177
In future, there should be
no shocks! Do you get it?

1714
02:03:20,391 --> 02:03:24,794
Son, be careful! She is the
topmost devil in the family.

1715
02:03:25,797 --> 02:03:27,264
She has troubled us a lot!

1716
02:03:28,266 --> 02:03:29,392
She won't spare you too!

1717
02:03:35,673 --> 02:03:37,334
Tell them immediately; everything
will be fine.

1718
02:03:37,408 --> 02:03:38,466
But where is mummy?

1719
02:03:38,543 --> 02:03:41,068
Hey! Hello! Listen!

1720
02:03:41,345 --> 02:03:42,403
What is going on?

1721
02:03:43,081 --> 02:03:44,139
Everything will be settled.

1722
02:03:44,215 --> 02:03:46,206
Go immediately and talk to mummy.
- You also come.

1723
02:03:46,284 --> 02:03:47,410
Hey, one minute! One minute!

1724
02:03:48,286 --> 02:03:50,151
Both of you had eloped, means what?

1725
02:03:50,621 --> 02:03:51,815
Actually.. - When had you
held hands and run away?

1726
02:03:52,090 --> 02:03:53,421
These people have a misconception.

1727
02:03:53,491 --> 02:03:55,550
Actually it so happened that -
Brother-in-law! Brother-in-law, photo!

1728
02:03:55,626 --> 02:03:56,820
Amrik, listen to me..
- Brother-in-law, photo!

1729
02:03:57,095 --> 02:03:58,153
Brother-in-law, photo!

1730
02:03:58,229 --> 02:04:00,220
One second.. Hey, brother-in-law's
friend, will you click a photo?

1731
02:04:03,101 --> 02:04:04,159
From here! From here!

1732
02:04:05,636 --> 02:04:06,694
Dear!

1733
02:04:10,108 --> 02:04:11,166
Ready?

1734
02:04:12,110 --> 02:04:13,839
We are ready! Click it!

1735
02:04:19,851 --> 02:04:21,113
Hey!

1736
02:04:21,185 --> 02:04:22,243
Son, some people have
come to meet you.

1737
02:04:22,320 --> 02:04:23,787
Uncle!
- Call me papa; not uncle.

1738
02:04:25,323 --> 02:04:27,257
Son, why don't you
go and freshen up?

1739
02:04:27,391 --> 02:04:28,517
No, I am very fresh.

1740
02:04:29,127 --> 02:04:31,118
You have come after a long journey!
- No, l..

1741
02:04:31,596 --> 02:04:32,654
Vikram!

1742
02:04:33,264 --> 02:04:34,595
No, I am absolutely..
- Come here!

1743
02:04:35,399 --> 02:04:36,798
Take brother to the
guest room upstairs.

1744
02:04:37,135 --> 02:04:39,126
Son, go and freshen up.
- Come, come.

1745
02:04:39,403 --> 02:04:40,461
Have you come to Bhatinda
for the first time?

1746
02:04:41,139 --> 02:04:43,266
Geet dear, tell me.

1747
02:04:43,541 --> 02:04:47,477
Look, mummy..
- Dear, first tell me how are you?

1748
02:04:48,746 --> 02:04:51,806
It has been 9 months.
Are you all right?

1749
02:04:53,151 --> 02:04:55,142
Mummy, don't worry about me;
I am perfectly all right.

1750
02:04:55,553 --> 02:04:57,214
I..
- Does Aditya treat you well?

1751
02:04:59,157 --> 02:05:00,215
Well?

1752
02:05:01,425 --> 02:05:02,483
What?

1753
02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:03,618
Yes.

1754
02:05:04,162 --> 02:05:05,493
Doesn't he treat you well?

1755
02:05:07,698 --> 02:05:08,756
Well?

1756
02:05:08,833 --> 02:05:10,425
Mummy, he cares so much for me!

1757
02:05:12,637 --> 02:05:13,831
Even you have never cared
that much for me.

1758
02:05:14,438 --> 02:05:15,496
Come, my dear!

1759
02:05:16,507 --> 02:05:18,372
What is this hugging game going
on between mother and daughter?

1760
02:05:20,645 --> 02:05:22,510
Tell me now, why did you deceive me?

1761
02:05:22,780 --> 02:05:24,179
You were supposed to elope with me..

1762
02:05:24,248 --> 02:05:25,647
..but you eloped with my sister!

1763
02:05:26,184 --> 02:05:27,242
That's very wrong!

1764
02:05:27,451 --> 02:05:29,919
Brother-in-law, why did
you do this to her?

1765
02:05:30,321 --> 02:05:31,845
What was lacking in me?

1766
02:05:32,190 --> 02:05:33,248
Tell us!

1767
02:05:33,457 --> 02:05:34,515
Do you have an answer?

1768
02:05:35,326 --> 02:05:39,194
It so happened that..
- What?

1769
02:05:40,665 --> 02:05:42,860
Actually, I made a mistake
in the darkness.

1770
02:05:42,934 --> 02:05:44,196
Really?

1771
02:05:45,403 --> 02:05:48,668
I thought it was you; in the morning
I realised it was your sister!

1772
02:05:48,873 --> 02:05:50,204
Oh God!

1773
02:05:50,808 --> 02:05:51,866
Your bad luck!

1774
02:05:52,210 --> 02:05:55,338
Well, tell us who is this specimen
you have brought along?

1775
02:05:56,214 --> 02:05:58,205
Who? -Your friend.

1776
02:05:59,217 --> 02:06:02,209
Is he my consolation prize?
In your place?

1777
02:06:03,287 --> 02:06:04,549
One minute; may I have a seat?

1778
02:06:05,223 --> 02:06:06,884
Hey girls, go away.
Let us talk to him.

1779
02:06:07,225 --> 02:06:08,351
Very good. There is something
we needed to discuss.

1780
02:06:08,426 --> 02:06:09,484
Mummy, let us go inside.

1781
02:06:09,560 --> 02:06:11,221
We want to perform your wedding
ceremony in the Gurudwara.

1782
02:06:11,829 --> 02:06:13,421
Legally you are already married.

1783
02:06:13,965 --> 02:06:15,227
This is just for our satisfaction.

1784
02:06:17,301 --> 02:06:20,566
Don't look at her. You tell us.
Do you have any objection?

1785
02:06:20,638 --> 02:06:21,696
Then we will not do it.

1786
02:06:21,772 --> 02:06:25,230
It will be better if you
once talk to Geet.

1787
02:06:25,509 --> 02:06:27,568
You don't have any objection,
do you?

1788
02:06:29,247 --> 02:06:31,238
Please talk to Geet first.

1789
02:06:31,582 --> 02:06:33,243
It's settled then. Very good!

1790
02:06:33,517 --> 02:06:34,848
Dear, invite everyone
from your side.

1791
02:06:35,253 --> 02:06:37,778
Of course they will come!
His relatives will attend.

1792
02:06:37,855 --> 02:06:38,913
Very good.

1793
02:06:38,990 --> 02:06:40,514
Great, we should arrange
the marriage soon.

1794
02:06:49,400 --> 02:06:52,267
This is the height! They
have crossed the limit!

1795
02:06:53,271 --> 02:06:54,397
There has been confusion!

1796
02:06:54,805 --> 02:06:56,796
Nobody could have imagined that
something like this could happen!

1797
02:06:57,742 --> 02:06:59,869
But don't worry, ok? Geet
has gone to talk to mummy.

1798
02:07:00,278 --> 02:07:02,269
She should have told as
soon as we arrived!

1799
02:07:02,947 --> 02:07:05,279
Nonsense! All the rituals are
being performed with you..

1800
02:07:05,349 --> 02:07:08,284
..and I am being forced
to take a bath in here!

1801
02:07:09,287 --> 02:07:11,755
Enough! Where is Geet? I will
talk to her right now!

1802
02:07:11,822 --> 02:07:14,552
One second! Right now she is
surrounded by many people.

1803
02:07:15,359 --> 02:07:17,293
I will call her aside
and talk to her.

1804
02:07:18,296 --> 02:07:20,423
Anshuman, everybody thinks
that you are my friend.

1805
02:07:20,965 --> 02:07:23,559
It will look odd if
you call her aside.

1806
02:07:28,306 --> 02:07:30,638
If it seems odd to them,
then let it be so!

1807
02:07:31,542 --> 02:07:34,306
Isn't it the truth that
she and I are a couple?

1808
02:07:34,912 --> 02:07:36,038
And we have to tell them that only!

1809
02:07:37,048 --> 02:07:39,312
Yes, but let her handle it.

1810
02:07:39,450 --> 02:07:41,315
Look, it is very important to
explain to them properly..

1811
02:07:41,385 --> 02:07:43,853
..otherwise it can bring
dishonour to the family.

1812
02:07:44,322 --> 02:07:45,380
There are so many guests.

1813
02:07:47,992 --> 02:07:51,985
These boys want to drag me to have
a look at the sugarcane fields!

1814
02:07:52,596 --> 02:07:53,858
Why should I have a look
at sugarcane fields?

1815
02:07:54,465 --> 02:07:55,591
What's so special about
sugarcane fields?

1816
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:57,058
I don't want to see
sugarcane fields!

1817
02:07:57,335 --> 02:07:59,860
Don't look. Refuse their proposal.
Don't look..

1818
02:08:00,338 --> 02:08:02,465
Don't feel tense. Everything
will be all right, ok?

1819
02:08:02,673 --> 02:08:03,731
Don't worry.

1820
02:08:17,888 --> 02:08:18,946
Shall I tell you something?

1821
02:08:19,423 --> 02:08:21,084
Your choice is better than mine.

1822
02:08:22,893 --> 02:08:23,951
Lucky.

1823
02:08:24,762 --> 02:08:26,423
Ok, tell me what did
you want to say?

1824
02:08:29,567 --> 02:08:32,968
Look, mummy.. you all are..

1825
02:08:36,374 --> 02:08:37,432
I mean..

1826
02:08:38,843 --> 02:08:44,372
..what I want to say is..
there is no problem.

1827
02:08:46,450 --> 02:08:47,508
Everything is fine.

1828
02:08:52,723 --> 02:08:55,385
But here.. all this..

1829
02:09:00,998 --> 02:09:02,056
I want to lie down for a while.

1830
02:09:03,401 --> 02:09:06,666
Sure, dear. You are very
tired, aren't you?

1831
02:09:08,406 --> 02:09:09,464
Take rest for some time.

1832
02:09:10,474 --> 02:09:11,532
Go to sleep.

1833
02:09:27,625 --> 02:09:30,093
Be courteous! Be respectful!
Be alert!

1834
02:09:30,694 --> 02:09:34,425
On the 17th, that is two days
later,

1835
02:09:34,498 --> 02:09:38,434
..the wedding will take place!

1836
02:09:59,924 --> 02:10:02,449
Oh! I am floored!

1837
02:10:03,794 --> 02:10:04,852
Where are you taking me?

1838
02:10:35,159 --> 02:10:36,217
Did you tell her?

1839
02:10:36,494 --> 02:10:38,553
No. I don't know why!

1840
02:10:40,097 --> 02:10:42,088
I don't know; I could
easily have told mummy.

1841
02:10:42,500 --> 02:10:43,558
To papa also.

1842
02:10:43,767 --> 02:10:44,825
I had got a chance also.

1843
02:10:47,037 --> 02:10:49,835
I was feeling a strange kind
of fear! Restlessness!

1844
02:10:50,574 --> 02:10:51,905
As if something is wrong!

1845
02:10:52,710 --> 02:10:54,041
As if a train is leaving!

1846
02:10:55,713 --> 02:10:56,771
Come here, come here.

1847
02:10:57,181 --> 02:10:58,239
Come here.

1848
02:10:58,649 --> 02:10:59,980
Show me.
- What happened?

1849
02:11:01,585 --> 02:11:02,643
What is this?

1850
02:11:05,222 --> 02:11:07,588
What?
- Here; like this.

1851
02:11:09,527 --> 02:11:12,860
This tension doesn't suit your face.

1852
02:11:13,797 --> 02:11:14,855
You look very ugly.

1853
02:11:15,266 --> 02:11:18,724
Your face like this! You see?

1854
02:11:22,006 --> 02:11:23,064
Correct!

1855
02:11:23,140 --> 02:11:24,539
You look stunning this way.

1856
02:11:25,543 --> 02:11:26,601
Always be like this.

1857
02:11:26,677 --> 02:11:28,872
If you look good, then good things
will happen with you, ok?

1858
02:11:31,749 --> 02:11:33,148
You have become just like me!

1859
02:11:36,820 --> 02:11:37,878
'Geet!'

1860
02:11:38,622 --> 02:11:39,680
Listen!

1861
02:11:40,558 --> 02:11:42,549
Talk to Anshuman. He
is a bit distressed.

1862
02:11:42,626 --> 02:11:43,957
'l am coming in!'

1863
02:11:45,696 --> 02:11:46,754
What is going on in here?

1864
02:11:48,566 --> 02:11:50,227
One minute. Let me talk to him.
- Sorry.

1865
02:11:51,835 --> 02:11:54,565
Hasn't grandma said that you will
not get together at night..

1866
02:11:54,638 --> 02:11:56,572
..before the wedding?

1867
02:11:57,174 --> 02:11:58,835
Somebody has given a very
appropriate name to all of you.

1868
02:11:59,577 --> 02:12:00,635
'Saali (sister-in-law)!

1869
02:12:00,711 --> 02:12:02,645
Brother-in-law, you
have broken my heart.

1870
02:12:02,980 --> 02:12:04,914
You have invited my wrath
for the rest of your life.

1871
02:12:05,583 --> 02:12:06,641
Come.

1872
02:12:07,918 --> 02:12:11,979
He too is here! Geet,
in front of him!

1873
02:12:12,590 --> 02:12:13,648
Shut up!

1874
02:12:13,724 --> 02:12:14,782
We will talk tomorrow morning.

1875
02:12:14,858 --> 02:12:16,587
Oh, cheating! Cheating!

1876
02:12:16,860 --> 02:12:17,918
Bye-bye, brother-in-law!

1877
02:12:18,062 --> 02:12:20,257
Have a good night! With your friend!

1878
02:12:21,165 --> 02:12:22,325
Good night.
- Bye, brother-in-law!

1879
02:12:22,600 --> 02:12:23,658
What happened?

1880
02:12:24,802 --> 02:12:25,996
Geet had come to meet you.

1881
02:12:26,337 --> 02:12:27,599
She said she will meet
you in the morning.

1882
02:12:28,205 --> 02:12:29,866
What? - Do one thing..

1883
02:12:30,608 --> 02:12:32,007
Come. Come.

1884
02:13:21,725 --> 02:13:22,783
I will see you later.

1885
02:13:30,668 --> 02:13:31,726
Hi!
- Hi!

1886
02:13:31,869 --> 02:13:32,927
Did you get ready in the morning?

1887
02:13:33,337 --> 02:13:34,668
I will be leaving in a little while.

1888
02:13:36,407 --> 02:13:37,669
Are you leaving?

1889
02:13:38,742 --> 02:13:39,800
I have to go.

1890
02:13:41,679 --> 02:13:42,873
These people will not let you go.

1891
02:13:45,683 --> 02:13:46,741
Geet, this time l
will not stay back.

1892
02:13:49,219 --> 02:13:51,084
He is waiting for you. Bye.

1893
02:13:55,693 --> 02:13:56,751
Geet!

1894
02:14:00,030 --> 02:14:01,088
Geet!

1895
02:14:12,443 --> 02:14:15,435
Ok, Geet. No tension; no problem.

1896
02:14:16,180 --> 02:14:18,375
You haven't told them
so far; no problem.

1897
02:14:18,982 --> 02:14:20,040
We will tell now.

1898
02:14:20,184 --> 02:14:21,310
I will tell you how.

1899
02:14:21,919 --> 02:14:23,716
Look, catch hold of one of them..

1900
02:14:23,787 --> 02:14:24,845
..whoever you come across first.

1901
02:14:25,255 --> 02:14:26,722
Mummy, papa or uncle.

1902
02:14:27,324 --> 02:14:29,849
And tell them that you are
ready to get married.

1903
02:14:30,728 --> 02:14:32,252
To Anshuman, and not to Aditya.

1904
02:14:33,197 --> 02:14:35,324
The schedule will remain the same.

1905
02:14:35,733 --> 02:14:36,859
The arrangements will
remain the same.

1906
02:14:37,735 --> 02:14:39,726
Everybody will feel as happy
as they were supposed to be.

1907
02:14:40,471 --> 02:14:43,736
Just remove Aditya and
bring in Anshuman.

1908
02:14:44,007 --> 02:14:47,067
As soon as you say this, they
will ask you many questions.

1909
02:14:47,411 --> 02:14:49,743
This, and that and how!
Then you answer them..

1910
02:14:49,813 --> 02:14:52,145
..about how we had met.

1911
02:14:53,016 --> 02:14:57,009
How I had come to meet you at your
hostel along with my friend!

1912
02:14:58,021 --> 02:14:59,420
Then how we..

1913
02:16:02,152 --> 02:16:03,551
'l was feeling a strange
kind of fear.'

1914
02:16:04,488 --> 02:16:05,546
'Restlessness.'

1915
02:16:07,090 --> 02:16:08,284
'As if something wrong
was happening.'

1916
02:16:09,960 --> 02:16:11,086
'As if some train was leaving.'

1917
02:16:31,081 --> 02:16:32,446
Geet! Stop!

1918
02:16:33,851 --> 02:16:34,909
Will you tell them now?

1919
02:16:35,853 --> 02:16:37,115
I will also tell them.
We will tell together.

1920
02:16:47,598 --> 02:16:48,860
Geet!

1921
02:16:50,868 --> 02:16:51,926
Geet, stop!

1922
02:17:01,945 --> 02:17:03,003
Oh, gosh!

1923
02:17:05,883 --> 02:17:06,941
What happened?

1924
02:17:07,618 --> 02:17:08,880
Geet, what happened?

1925
02:17:08,952 --> 02:17:10,010
Is he coming?

1926
02:17:10,888 --> 02:17:14,221
Who?
- Anshuman. Is he coming?

1927
02:17:15,893 --> 02:17:17,360
Yes.
- Is he looking this was?

1928
02:17:19,229 --> 02:17:20,287
Yes, he is looking.

1929
02:17:26,904 --> 02:17:29,031
Grandma! Grandpa!

1930
02:17:38,382 --> 02:17:39,906
I will be under one
obligation from you.

1931
02:17:41,518 --> 02:17:44,510
Just one. That you brought
Anshuman back.

1932
02:17:45,522 --> 02:17:49,253
Otherwise I would never have
realised.. what I wanted.

1933
02:17:51,461 --> 02:17:53,452
Aditya, now I am going
to listen to my heart.

1934
02:17:56,934 --> 02:17:57,992
Then everything will be all right.

1935
02:18:56,994 --> 02:18:58,461
Let me hear you say!

1936
02:19:02,599 --> 02:19:04,191
Come on! Come on!

1937
02:19:11,608 --> 02:19:13,473
The whole world is glittering

1938
02:19:13,543 --> 02:19:15,602

Children, your parents
are very mischievous!

1977
02:21:09,126 --> 02:21:15,190
They lied time and again, but I had
caught them the very first time.

1978
02:21:16,266 --> 02:21:17,324
Right?

1979

Yes, grandpa.

02:21:21,671 --> 02:21:22,729
Yes, grandpa.

02:21:23,140 --> 02:21:26,871
Children, at my age,
it doesn't take time.

1983
02:21:27,477 --> 02:21:29,672
Just once glance is enough..

1984
02:21:30,147 --> 02:21:35,278
..to realise what is going on
between the boy and the girl.

1985
02:21:35,485 --> 02:21:36,543
Yes, grandpa.

Every moment.

02:22:05,182 --> 02:22:06,774
Heart has become restless,
And gone wild
