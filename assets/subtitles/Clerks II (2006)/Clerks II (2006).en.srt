1
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:01,453
Yeah, I got a fire
at the Quick Stop.

2
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:02,756
Yeah.

3
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,470
Terrorists?

4
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:04,320
I left the coffee pot
on again, didn't I?

5
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:08,790
Shit!

6
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:10,796
Now where am I gonna
bring chicks to fuck

7
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,424
when my mom's home?

8
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:49,163
<i> Here we stand </i>

9
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:52,069
<i> Like an Adam and an Eve </i>

10
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:57,270
<i> Waterfalls </i>

11
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,269
<i> The Garden of Eden </i>

12
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:04,943
<i> Two fools in love </i>

13
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:05,949
<i> So beautiful... </i>

14
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:08,953
So, ready for your big last day?

15
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:10,114
I am.

16
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:11,919
When do you and your old lady
head down to Florida?

17
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,118
Tomorrow morning.

18
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,285
Car's all packed up.

19
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:15,294
You gonna do anything crazy

20
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,421
before you leave
New Jersey forever?

21
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:18,430
How long have you known me?

22
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:20,125
If I were you,
I'd spray-paint "eat pussy"

23
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,464
across the side of the building
in huge letters.

24
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:24,299
Why?

25
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:26,066
Let 'em know
you were there, man.

26
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:27,800
I'd rather let them know
I'm not an asshole.

27
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,330
Too late for that.

28
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,105
I'm really gonna miss you, man.

29
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:33,339
<i> Hey </i>

30
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,971
<i> Once there were parking lots </i>

31
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:39,485
<i> Now it's a peaceful oasis </i>

32
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,578
<i> You've got it, you've got it </i>

33
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,179
<i> This was a Pizza Hut </i>

34
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:47,489
<i> Now it's all covered
with daisies </i>

35
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:49,427
<i> You've got it, you've got it </i>

36
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:55,128
<i> I miss the honky-tonks,
Dairy Queens and 7-Elevens </i>

37
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:56,999
<i> You've got it, you've got it </i>

38
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,970
<i> And as things fell apart </i>

39
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:02,941
<i> Nobody paid much attention </i>

40
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:05,102
<i> You've got it, you've got it </i>

41
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:17,254
<i> Years ago </i>

42
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,953
<i> I was an angry young man... </i>

43
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:22,961
I can't believe they haven't
done anything with it yet.

44
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:25,156
The Lord did
something with it.

45
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:27,666
He smited that hellhole.

46
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,962
Listen to you.

47
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:29,967
Do you mean to tell me

48
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:31,503
you don't miss
that place at all?

49
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:33,164
<i>God, no.</i>

50
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:35,037
Do you?

51
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:39,344
Of course not.

52
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:42,974
<i> I wish I had a lawnmower </i>

53
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:45,108
<i> You've got it, you've got it </i>

54
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,986
<i> </i>

55
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,014
<i> </i>

56
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:32,731
<i> </i>

57
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:53,752
<i> I dream of cherry pies </i>

58
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:58,348
<i> Candy bars
and chocolate chip cookies </i>

59
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:00,552
<i> You've got it, you've got it </i>

60
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:02,754
<i> Don't leave me stranded here </i>

61
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:07,459
<i> I can't get used
to this lifestyle. </i>

62
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:21,635
<i> Grandma, what was it like </i>

63
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:25,481
<i> To be on that holiday site? </i>

64
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:27,452
Get the fuck out of here!

65
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:30,615
<i> Grandma said, "Do come in,
my little friend." </i>

66
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:33,819
You know, sometimes I wish
I did a little more with my life

67
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,988
instead of hanging out in front
of places selling weed and shit.

68
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,828
Like, maybe be an animal doctor.

69
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,334
Why not me?

70
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:44,700
I like seals and shit.

71
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:48,173
Or maybe an astronaut.

72
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:49,936
Yeah.

73
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:52,774
Like, be the first motherfucker
to see a new galaxy

74
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:57,215
or find
a new alien life-form...

75
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,649
and fuck it.

76
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:02,916
And people'd be like,
"There he goes.

77
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:06,686
Homeboy fucked a Martian once."

78
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:08,785
Holy shit.

79
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:10,455
Our first customer
since our triumphant return.

80
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:11,463
Act cool.

81
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,624
Hold on.

82
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,302
Yeah, you guys holdin'?

83
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:21,170
Shit, everything but coke,
heroin and your cock.

84
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:22,936
What?

85
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:24,237
How about a nickel bag, man?

86
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,768
<i>Oh, 15 bucks, little man.</i>

87
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:28,747
Put that shit in my hand.

88
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,614
<i> Nong, nong, nagga-
nagga-nong-nong. </i>

89
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:33,642
He likes to sing.

90
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:40,151
So, uh, I haven't seen
you guys in a while, man.

91
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:41,285
Where you been all this time?

92
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,158
Me and Silent Bob
finally bought a car,

93
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,663
we're cruising down
to the Boardwalk...

94
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,460
fucking Middletown cop
pulls us over

95
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:48,091
for Suspicion of Mischief.

96
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,396
What the fuck does that mean?

97
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:52,461
We were driving around
with a deployed airbag.

98
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:53,938
The cops pull us over.

99
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,203
They find two pounds
of Jamaican lambswool.

100
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,107
Prosecutor wants
to put us away for a dime,

101
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,408
but the judge gives us
rehab instead.

102
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:01,413
Shit, rehab?

103
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:02,175
Yup-yup.

104
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:03,307
How long were you in?

105
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:04,316
JAY:
Six months, sir.

106
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,284
We got six months
and two days on the wagon

107
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,911
as a good friend of Bill W.'s.

108
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,921
Check it out.

109
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,923
Just got it two days ago,
before we got out.

110
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,583
Yeah, but if you're holding
all the time,

111
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,924
aren't you gonna be tempted
to get high?

112
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:19,363
Oh, not with the power
of Christ on my side, sir.

113
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,599
Is that a fuckin' Bible?

114
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:25,103
Hey, hey,
the Holy fuckin' Bible, son!

115
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:27,332
What the fuck kind
of songbird Jesus-freak dealer

116
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:28,670
did you bring me to?

117
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,676
<i>I like them, man.
They're funny.</i>

118
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,473
They're fuckin' stupid.

119
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,843
You should read your Bible,
sirs.

120
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,872
You'll find all types
of weird shit in there.

121
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,282
Like, did you know
Jesus was a Jew?

122
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:41,911
Yeah.

123
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,454
I need two Egga-Mooby Muffins,

124
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:48,755
and we're almost out
of hash browns.

125
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:49,886
Hold on.

126
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,387
Now, Randal!

127
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:00,328
What are you writing
over there, anyway,

128
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,340
your memoirs?

129
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,705
I'm battling

130
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:05,108
this jackass
on his blog's message board.

131
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:06,133
About what?

132
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:08,578
On how he's got
too much free time and no life.

133
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:10,445
So does the guy who's
flaming him on his Web site.

134
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,451
I can't help it.
The guy pisses me off.

135
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:13,884
It's this fuck in a wheelchair

136
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,751
that's always preying
on everyone's sympathies,

137
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:19,019
writing these long diatribes
about how he'll never walk again

138
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,356
and how walkers should
appreciate the blessings

139
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,157
of their functioning legs.

140
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:24,355
That diatribe, as you call it,

141
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,523
sounds like
some poor crippled guy

142
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,226
pouring out his heart
and feelings.

143
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:28,528
Oh, fuck him, man.

144
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,195
Trying to guilt me
into walking around more

145
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,863
because he's all gimped out?

146
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,565
What kind of mind-fuck
is that shit?

147
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:35,301
So I've been getting
into it with him,

148
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:38,276
throwing it back
in his stupid crippy-boy face

149
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:39,869
about how I love
to just sit around

150
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:43,313
and how I'd rather drive to
the end of the block than walk.

151
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:45,044
The guy's in a wheelchair.

152
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,915
Yeah. That's why
I called him crippy-boy.

153
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:48,477
Have a good one.

154
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,955
You fuckin' freak.

155
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:56,254
I'm not even gonna point out
the irony here.

156
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:57,762
What's the matter with you?

157
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:58,923
What'd I do now?

158
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,091
There's a crippled guy
who found a way

159
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:02,259
to reach out to a world
he feels isolated from,

160
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,428
and you somehow found a
way to take issue with him.

161
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,097
Sure, take his side.

162
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:07,264
Have you become so embittered

163
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:09,934
that you now feel the need
to attack the handicapped?

164
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,102
What handicap?

165
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:12,610
The guy's
just in a wheelchair.

166
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,943
It's not like
he's Anne Frank or something.

167
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:16,608
Anne Frank?

168
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,617
Yeah, Anne Frank,
the chick that was all...

169
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,279
...till the miracle worker
showed up

170
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,981
and knocked
some smarts into her.

171
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:23,989
<i>You're talking</i>

172
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:25,320
about Helen Keller.

173
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:26,655
No, I'm not.
I'm talking about Anne Frank.

174
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:27,818
She was deaf, dumb and blind.

175
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,827
No, she wasn't.

176
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:30,988
Helen Keller was
deaf, dumb and blind.

177
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,156
Are you sure?

178
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,324
Yup.

179
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,493
Then who the fuck's Anne Frank?

180
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,001
Anne Frank's
the little Jewish girl

181
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:38,503
who hid from the Nazis

182
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:40,164
in a secret room
with her family.

183
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:41,173
She wrote a diary.

184
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:42,231
Oh, yeah.

185
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:44,333
Well, then, I guess
this guy is like Anne Frank,

186
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,845
what with the diary, you know?

187
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:50,838
No, he's like Helen Keller
with the handicap, you jerk!

188
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:53,442
You always got to be right,
don't you?

189
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,283
You Nazi douche bag.

190
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,948
What? What do you want?

191
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,958
No, we don't serve Cow Tippers
in the morning.

192
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:03,086
Freedom Toast is a possibility.

193
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:13,171
<i> </i>

194
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:19,370
Oh, we totally do.

195
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:23,939
All right, that'll be $12.64.

196
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:43,966
Avert your eyes, you perv.

197
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,164
That's not very hygienic.

198
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,070
That's all I'm gonna tell you.

199
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:52,603
Emma, are you like this

200
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,704
'cause you have an
unnaturally large clit?

201
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:58,948
You just had to tell him,
didn't you?

202
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:00,281
It kind of came out one day.

203
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:01,411
He says it's so big,

204
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:02,614
it's almost like
a little cock...

205
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,782
which says all kinds
of weird things about him

206
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,348
that I don't even want
to think about.

207
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,450
You wouldn't want
to be with a girl

208
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:08,687
with an oversized clit?

209
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:12,061
No, 'cause the next stop is
a guy with an undersized dick.

210
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:36,253
You're a little hard.

211
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:37,619
'Cause you're
a little close to me.

212
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:39,089
I can pull back, if you want.

213
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:42,219
Can we pull back into our
own apartment in Florida again?

214
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,161
Really? Goddamn it, Dante.

215
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:45,322
How many times
are we gonna have

216
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:47,093
this fucking conversation?

217
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,761
There is no point
in getting an apartment anymore.

218
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,429
My mother has
pretty much told us

219
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,438
that she's gonna get us
a house as a wedding gift.

220
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:54,939
Your parents' generosity

221
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:57,169
just makes me
a little uncomfortable, Em.

222
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:58,699
They're giving us a house.

223
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:01,212
Your dad's giving me
one of his car washes to run.

224
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:02,544
It just feels weird.

225
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:05,448
Babe, it just feels weird
because you're so used

226
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,349
to life shitting
on you all the time.

227
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:09,377
What the fuck does that mean?

228
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:11,116
All I'm saying is that suddenly,

229
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:12,784
you have a woman that loves you,

230
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,759
a new job opportunity

231
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,592
and a fantastic life
to look forward to, right?

232
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,395
You got to face it, tiger:
You hit the jackpot.

233
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,130
RANDAL:
What's up?

234
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:33,237
Something wrong?

235
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,246
RANDAL:
Nope.

236
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,770
Just saw you guys talking.

237
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,373
Thought I'd come out here
and join you.

238
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:38,383
God, it must be
nice to have a job

239
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:39,975
with so much downtime.

240
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:41,609
Downtime's important.

241
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,679
If I had to deal with all
the fucking mouth-breathers

242
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:45,212
nonstop, without a break,

243
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:46,724
I'd put my head
in the deep fryer.

244
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,125
Balls, too.

245
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,129
Do you really want

246
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,290
to sit here and watch me
and my fiance make out?

247
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,993
- Are you that much of a loser?
- Not really.

248
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:56,898
I was actually gonna ask
you two to knock it off

249
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,597
while I was out here.

250
00:13:58,637 --> 00:13:59,899
I don't fucking understand
why you can't be happy

251
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:01,406
for your best friend.

252
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,271
He finally found a woman
who loves him.

253
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,902
Like you even register
as a chick to me.

254
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:07,606
You might as well be a dude.

255
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:09,079
Really?

256
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:10,945
Yeah. You're
my best friend's girlfriend.

257
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,915
You became
persona non-nookie to me

258
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:15,386
the moment he started diddling
your pooter.

259
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:16,945
So thinking of me
in terms of being a girl

260
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,353
kind of creeps you out,
does it?

261
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,881
Sweetheart, I don't think
of you in terms of being a girl.

262
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:23,759
I don't think of you
in any way...

263
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:27,163
Oh, that was just wrong.

264
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,598
If you don't get
the fuck out of here

265
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,932
so that I can spend
some quality time with my man,

266
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,835
next, I'm gonna show you
my pooter.

267
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,306
Why would you want
to do something like that?

268
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,832
All right, all right,
I'm leaving!

269
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:38,866
Jesus!

270
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:44,243
What'd you do that for?

271
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:46,217
You realize he just
thinks you're trying

272
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:48,311
to get him into a three-way
with us now, don't you?

273
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,117
EMMA: Yeah, right.
With Graves?

274
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:52,715
That man's a total fucking
Lloyd, like most Jersey guys.

275
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:53,918
Hey!

276
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,893
You talk tough, but when
we're crossing the state line,

277
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:57,395
I bet you get all sentimental
for Jersey

278
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:58,896
and squirt a few tears.

279
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,421
Yeah, tears of joy, maybe.

280
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:01,490
Jersey sucks,

281
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:02,932
and we are surrounded by morons.

282
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,230
On that note, I'm gonna go.

283
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:06,738
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
You're leaving?

284
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,535
EMMA:
Yeah, I've got
a ton of stuff to do

285
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,303
before we leave in the morning,
but I love you.

286
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:12,742
I love you, too.

287
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,609
<i>Bye.</i>

288
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:23,918
Dude, I'm pretty sure
your old lady wants

289
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:27,016
to get you and me together
in a three-way.

290
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:52,918
Ow.

291
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,249
Dude, how old are you?

292
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,589
You know I'm 19, Randal.

293
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,251
You wouldn't work for me
last week, remember?

294
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,590
'Cause you said working
on my birthday

295
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,755
would help me build character.

296
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,766
Well, at least you spelled
"cock" right this time.

297
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,769
Why the fuck are you
still getting rides

298
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,430
from your mother?

299
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,597
And even worse,

300
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,607
what the fuck are you
kissing her good-bye for?

301
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,768
What is she,
your fuckin' prom date?

302
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,437
You're not gonna bother me
today, Randal.

303
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,604
I'm in too good a mood.

304
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,614
Because your mom
slipped you the tongue?

305
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:26,948
No, because I just read online
that there's gonna be

306
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,045
a live-action
Transformers movie.

307
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,214
And?

308
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:32,883
Well... I mean, as you know,

309
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:34,893
my online handle
is Optimus Prime.

310
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,895
I know that.
I wish I didn't.

311
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:40,387
Well, so not only is it awesome

312
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:43,731
that there's gonna be a
live-action Transformers movie,

313
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:46,897
but I'm, like,
positioned or whatever

314
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:51,740
with the best possible
Net handle and e-mail address

315
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:53,404
for when the movie comes out.

316
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:56,573
Oh, you're gonna be rolling
in the pussy, man.

317
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,310
Don't be gross.

318
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,749
Says the guy
who was just playing

319
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:01,685
tonsil hockey with his mother.

320
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,017
Mr. Dante!

321
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:06,422
Leave Elias alone, Randal!

322
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:09,924
Don't look at his wee-wee.

323
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:13,026
Dude, the Transformers sucked.

324
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,259
Oh, no, they didn't.

325
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:15,664
They were more
than meets the eye.

326
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,936
They could beat the pants
off Ranger Danger any day.

327
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,030
Yeah. I'll lose sleep wondering
whether you're right

328
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,506
- about that or not.
- Ow.

329
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,941
I thought you weren't even
allowed to watch a lot of TV

330
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:26,774
in your house 'cause you're all
Christian and shit.

331
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:29,076
Well, as it turns out,
cars and trucks

332
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:30,877
that turn into...

333
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:34,943
robots aren't really
that blasphemous,

334
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,954
because my pastor says

335
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:39,684
that machines can turn
into other machines,

336
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,455
and it's not a sleight
against God.

337
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:44,189
Transformers were
a total sleight against God,

338
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,891
inasmuch as God sent
His only begotten son

339
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:49,457
to die on the cross
to redeem mankind,

340
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:50,695
and all we did to pay him back

341
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,864
was make terrible fucking
cartoons like the Transformers.

342
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,704
Nice shot.

343
00:17:56,742 --> 00:18:01,543
Well, 'cause at Bible camp,
we made this flow chart which...

344
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,877
I mean, I don't know,

345
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:06,043
kind of, like, proved
or whatever that...

346
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,177
Well, okay...

347
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:08,481
Bible camp?!

348
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,509
Since God created...

349
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:12,751
Since God created man,

350
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:16,090
and man created
the Transformers...

351
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:20,221
...the Transformers are like
a gift from God, Randal.

352
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:23,063
No, sir.
They are not a gift from God.

353
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,297
They are an unholy curse

354
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:27,271
from the beast
we call the Desolate One.

355
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:28,739
I don't really want
to hear this, Randal.

356
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,298
The first of the fallen,

357
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:31,673
the spoiler of virgins,

358
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,940
the master of abortions!

359
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:35,741
You know I don't like to talk
about dark forces, Randal.

360
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,214
<i> Let me help you </i>

361
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:39,080
<i> Out of your chair, Grandma! </i>

362
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,382
<i> Grandma, what was it like </i>

363
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,548
<i> To be on that holiday site? </i>

364
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,115
<i> Late that night,
I awoke from my sleep </i>

365
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:49,719
<i> Hearing unknown voices </i>

366
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:50,955
<i>JAY/RANDAL:
 Laughing insane... </i>

367
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:57,731
<i>Oh...</i>

368
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,819
Oh, what the fuck was that?

369
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:18,823
What?

370
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:19,824
That wave.

371
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:21,655
I saw Becky, so I waved.

372
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:23,820
She'll be in here in 20 seconds.

373
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:24,829
And?

374
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:25,921
And you've got to greet her

375
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:28,261
before she gets in here,
you fuckin' ass-kiss?

376
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,267
What's that all about?

377
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:30,734
It's called friendship.

378
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:31,736
She's your boss.

379
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,101
You can't be friends
with your boss.

380
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:35,106
No, you can't be friends
with your boss.

381
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,437
I like my boss.

382
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:38,443
I think there's
something going on

383
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:39,603
between you two.

384
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:40,612
You're crazy.

385
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,614
You spend an awful lot
of time talking to her.

386
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,946
I spend an awful lot of time
talking to you, too.

387
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:46,109
And I've always maintained

388
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:48,949
you're harboring an unrequited
homosexual crush on me.

389
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,147
We're just friends.

390
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,656
That's what I keep telling you.

391
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,658
No, you idiot, me and Becks.

392
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,159
"Becks"?

393
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,161
I knew it.

394
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,663
You're fucking
around with the boss.

395
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:02,155
Yeah, that's why I'm moving
to Florida with my fiancee.

396
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,327
Why would you want
to fuck around

397
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,960
with a chick your own age, man?

398
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,971
If you've got to sow
some of your wild oats,

399
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,666
there's all
these fine young chicks

400
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,402
that stop in here after school.

401
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:13,934
First off, I'm not cheating
on my fiancee.

402
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:16,539
Secondly, if I was cheating
on my fiancee,

403
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:18,482
it wouldn't be with a teenager.

404
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:19,541
Why not?

405
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:20,950
The best part of this job

406
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:23,454
is all the barely-legal pussy
that comes in here.

407
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:24,853
And they all look up to me,

408
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,619
'cause I've got
a driver's license.

409
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:29,320
It's awesome.
You're 33.

410
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:31,158
You show me one
33-year-old chick

411
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:32,595
who's as buck-wild in bed

412
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:34,360
as her 17-year-old
counterpart.

413
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,162
17-year-olds
nowadays are crazy.

414
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:37,600
They're up for anything.

415
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,934
They even like it when
you go ass to mouth.

416
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:43,265
Oh... my... God.

417
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:44,275
What?

418
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:45,401
Are you serious?

419
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:47,810
I don't fuck around when
it comes to ass to mouth.

420
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:49,336
DANTE:
You never go ass to mouth.

421
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:50,712
It's never my idea.

422
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,740
These young girls today
get all horned up,

423
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:54,581
and they tell you
to go ass to mouth.

424
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,110
You never go
ass to mouth, Randal!

425
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:57,451
You sound like my mom.

426
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:58,979
Becks, do you ever
go ass to mouth?

427
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:00,457
You never go ass to mouth.

428
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:02,153
You've never gone ass to mouth?

429
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:03,627
You never go ass to mouth.

430
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,186
I've never gone ass to mouth.

431
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,424
Not even once?

432
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:07,864
Not even ever.

433
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:09,230
You're both so repressed.

434
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,326
All right, look,

435
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:12,360
I know you've given
a blow job, right?

436
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:14,372
I haven't even put
my purse down yet.

437
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:15,532
That's a yes.

438
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:17,735
And I know you've
gone down on chicks.

439
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,073
What's your point?

440
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,100
Well,

441
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:22,306
when you're done chowing down
on the no-no parts

442
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:23,905
of your lover,
you kiss him, right?

443
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,576
That's just like going
ass to mouth.

444
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,609
Okay, I'm pretty sure you just
compared a vagina to an asshole.

445
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:29,882
<i>And?</i>

446
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:32,788
Have you restocked
all the napkin holders yet?

447
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:34,792
That's an Elias job.

448
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:37,192
That comparison
of pink and brown eyes

449
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:38,890
just made it a Randal job.

450
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:39,988
ELIAS:
Zing!

451
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:42,123
Shut the fuck up, GoBot.

452
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:49,004
I could probably sue
this whole corporation right now

453
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:50,301
for sexual harassment.

454
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:52,503
You're just making me
restock the napkin holders

455
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:53,977
because of my firmly held
beliefs

456
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:55,980
on the subject of ass to mouth.

457
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:57,709
You never go ass to mouth!

458
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:00,081
Would you grow up?

459
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:05,789
<i>All right,
I'm gonna tell you this</i>

460
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,587
'cause we're friends...

461
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:10,493
but sometimes,
in the heat of the moment,

462
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:12,963
it's forgivable
to go ass to mouth.

463
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,497
I knew it.

464
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:22,973
I'm fuckin' bored, man!

465
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:27,501
And boredom's the first step
on the road to relapse.

466
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,288
Oh!

467
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:56,239
Would you fuck me?

468
00:22:57,476 --> 00:23:00,104
I'd fuck me.

469
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:03,706
I'd fuck me hard.

470
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:10,382
<i> Ooh, ooh... ooh, ooh...</i>

471
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,228
Shit.

472
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,640
Well, hello, Miss Scott.

473
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:34,111
Well, here he is,
the escape artist.

474
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,636
I'm not gone yet.

475
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,910
Please. You've been
gone for the last month.

476
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:39,246
When do you guys leave?

477
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:41,514
Well, we start driving
tomorrow morning.

478
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:43,453
Oh, uh, I left you
the forwarding address

479
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:45,388
for my last check
on the calendar there.

480
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,892
So you did.

481
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,554
That's her parents's house,
right?

482
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:54,292
Yes, but only until the wedding.

483
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:55,993
And then, from what I hear,

484
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:58,399
her parents
are giving us a house.

485
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,428
Nice!

486
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:02,770
So I guess dowries
are making a comeback.

487
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:03,900
Oh, yeah.

488
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,933
Her dad sweetened the pot
with two fatted calves

489
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:07,239
<i>and a goat.</i>

490
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:10,947
I'm gonna miss you, Hicks.

491
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:12,949
Yeah, I'm gonna miss you, too.

492
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:14,076
I still can't believe

493
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,713
you're just gonna leave
me alone in this place...

494
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:18,484
with Randal Graves,
of all people.

495
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:19,615
Quit.

496
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:20,716
Move to Florida.

497
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,420
You could work
at the car wash with me.

498
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,725
Wow, you make it
sound so tempting.

499
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:26,594
How can I say no?

500
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:29,725
Oh, yeah... 'cause it's a
fucking car wash in Florida.

501
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:31,429
Like it's any worse
than this place.

502
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,495
Hurl the insults
all you want, buddy man.

503
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:35,506
As soon as my uncle's
on his feet again,

504
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,531
it's not like I'm
gonna be staying here.

505
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:39,510
- Hey, how's he doing?
- A lot better.

506
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:41,603
It only took two years
and a shitload of chemo,

507
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,978
but... his red cell count's
almost back to normal.

508
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:45,242
That's great.

509
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:46,750
Yeah, it's great for me, too.

510
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:48,548
Couple of weeks
in this crap shack

511
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:51,283
turned into a couple of
years a little too quickly.

512
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,790
But, Hicks, we can sit here

513
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,917
making small talk
about your last day

514
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,258
and what it is I'm going
to do once you're gone,

515
00:24:57,295 --> 00:25:02,028
or we can treat this
like any other workday.

516
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:03,329
Ding-a-ling-a-ling!

517
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,211
Randal.

518
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:20,341
One ring to rule them all.

519
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:24,344
And you wonder why no chick'll
let you stick your cock in her.

520
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:26,516
I never wondered that.

521
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:27,957
Yeah, 'cause you've accepted
the fact

522
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:29,961
that you'll never get a chick
a long time ago.

523
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,495
I could get a chick if I wanted.

524
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,963
<i>Who are you kidding?</i>

525
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:34,625
You can't get a chick, you mook.

526
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,065
You're too weird and sad.

527
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,670
I turn down chicks
left and right.

528
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:45,699
<i>Your chicks are
your "left" and "right."</i>

529
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:48,809
Yeah, right.
What do you know?

530
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:50,781
Uh, I know
you're a huge fuckin' nerd

531
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:53,613
of Potsie-like proportions,
and no chicks dig nerds,

532
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:56,416
<i>especially nerds that are
into Lord of the Rings.</i>

533
00:25:57,989 --> 00:25:59,752
<i>Chicks dig Lord of the Rings,
Randal.</i>

534
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:00,951
Yeah. The kind of chicks

535
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:02,789
that are into swords
and elves and shit,

536
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:05,159
and I wouldn't fuck them
with the Torch of Gondor.

537
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:06,925
Oh, you're so gross!

538
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,533
Hey, man.

539
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:19,072
Welcome to Mooby's.
May I take your order?

540
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,202
Yeah, um...

541
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,507
let's see.

542
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:24,606
Give me one Udderly
Delicious Moo-ilk Shake,

543
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:27,777
Skinny Calf and an order
of onion rings. Thanks.

544
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:33,422
"One ring to rule them all."

545
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,584
"One ring to find them."

546
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:37,890
Oh, Jesus.

547
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:40,056
"One ring to bring them all."

548
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,794
"And in the darkness bind them."

549
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:44,358
Yes! Dude!

550
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:45,733
How many times?

551
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:46,964
<i>Well, um, three
for Fellowship,</i>

552
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:47,970
<i>two for Towers,</i>

553
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:50,166
<i>four for Return.</i>

554
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:51,436
<i>Five for Return.</i>

555
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:52,443
Dude!

556
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:53,535
All right, look,

557
00:26:53,578 --> 00:26:55,603
<i>there's only one Return, okay,</i>

558
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:58,411
and it ain't of the king...
it's of the Jedi.

559
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,315
<i>Oh, Star Wars geek.</i>

560
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:01,478
Oh, I'm the geek?

561
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:03,612
Look at you two,
whipping out your preciouses.

562
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:05,088
You'll have to excuse him.

563
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,920
He's not "down"
with the trilogy.

564
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,449
Oh, what the fuck happened
to this world?

565
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:10,825
There's only one trilogy,

566
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:12,591
you fucking morons.

567
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,121
You know what?

568
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:15,928
Maybe we should start
calling your friend Padme,

569
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,832
because he loves
Mannequin Skywalker

570
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:19,166
so much, right?

571
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:20,831
<i>"Danger, danger.</i>

572
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:22,169
"My name is Anakin.

573
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:25,267
My shitty acting
is ruining saga."

574
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,608
<i>Yeah.
Yeah, you're crazy, Jar-Jar.</i>

575
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:28,874
Oh, I'm crazy?

576
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:31,507
Those fucking hobbit movies
were boring as hell.

577
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:33,847
All it was
was a bunch of people walking.

578
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:36,786
Three movies of people walking
to a fuckin' volcano.

579
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,413
Here's the first movie.

580
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:45,656
And here's the second movie.

581
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:53,195
He is way off. Loser.

582
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:54,762
You ready for the third movie?

583
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:06,683
Fuckin' A.

584
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:08,913
Even the fuckin' trees walked
in those movies.

585
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:09,920
You know what?

586
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:11,148
I've had enough of you.

587
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:14,420
Your simplistic analysis
of the trilogy aside,

588
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:16,654
<i>The Lord of the Rings
was a massive achievement that</i>

589
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:17,753
even the Academy recognized

590
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,492
when they gave Peter Jackson
the Best Directing Oscar...

591
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:24,024
an award your little friend
George "Toy Boy" Lucas has never

592
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:25,730
and will never win.

593
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,067
Bones.

594
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:28,265
Oh, sick burn.

595
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:29,671
Let me tell you something.

596
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,938
If Peter Jackson
really wanted to blow me away

597
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,911
with those "Rings" movies,
he would've ended the third one

598
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:36,413
on the logical closure point,

599
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:38,848
not the 25 endings
that followed.

600
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,350
What's the logical
closure point?

601
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,545
Yeah, friend,

602
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:42,917
enlighten us.

603
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:45,787
When fucking Frito wakes up from
his little coma or whatever,

604
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:48,554
and the little hobbits are
jumping up and down on his bed,

605
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:50,060
and Sam leans in the doorway

606
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:51,960
and gives him
that very fuckin' gay look.

607
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,428
<i>ELIAS:
Not the Rings, Randal.</i>

608
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:54,955
Say what you will about Jesus,

609
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:56,728
<i>but leave the Rings out of this.</i>

610
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:59,168
I am gonna kick your ass
back to the Shire

611
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:00,535
if you don't
shut your fuckin' mouth.

612
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,006
That look was so gay,
I thought Sam was gonna tell

613
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:04,633
the little hobbits
to take a walk

614
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:06,268
so he could saunter
over to Frodo

615
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:07,608
and suck his fuckin' cock.

616
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:10,273
<i>Now, that would've been
an Academy Award-worthy ending.</i>

617
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:13,910
Hey, faggot, they're not gay.
They're hobbits.

618
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:16,545
And then right after
the Sam-Frodo suckfest,

619
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,385
right before the credits roll,

620
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,051
Sam fucking flat-out bricks
in Frodo's mouth.

621
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,492
I swear...

622
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:24,722
Fuck you!

623
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,529
<i>I made fun of
Lord of the Rings so hard,</i>

624
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:31,933
it made some super-geek puke
all over the counter.

625
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,494
Where do we keep
the mop and bucket

626
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:34,937
so I can have
Elias clean it up?

627
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:37,237
In the closet with the rest
of the cleaning products.

628
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:40,711
We have cleaning products?

629
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:46,177
Why does it smell so weird
in here?

630
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:47,650
Buh-bye.

631
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:50,677
I'm on to you.

632
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,483
You know he's not
gonna make it here long

633
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:58,291
once you're not here to protect
him anymore, don't you?

634
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:00,695
Well, you're the one out
there encouraging him,

635
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:02,700
advocating ass to mouth.

636
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:05,601
I wasn't advocating it,
you big prude.

637
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,764
I just said it was fine
once in a while.

638
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,774
Like you wouldn't do it
if Emma told you to.

639
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,298
<i>Christ, no!</i>

640
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:13,572
Oh, I thought love
knew no bounds.

641
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:17,145
Ew. That came off
kind of catty, didn't it?

642
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:19,116
A little daytime soapish, yeah.

643
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,276
I'm sorry.

644
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,979
I don't know why I said that.

645
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,715
I actually kind of like Emma.

646
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:24,813
So do I.

647
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:26,949
So that's why
you're getting married!

648
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,925
I can't wait until
you get engaged,

649
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,485
so I can bust your balls as
hard as you've busted mine.

650
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:33,895
You're going to be waiting
a long time, sir.

651
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:35,365
Oh, that's right.
I forgot.

652
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,595
You're the cold-hearted
ice princess

653
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:39,569
that doesn't believe
in marriage.

654
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:41,799
I'm not saying that
it's not all right for you,

655
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,000
but, yes, I do think

656
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:45,441
that marriage goes
against our primal nature.

657
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:46,602
To be loved?

658
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:49,238
To fuck as much as possible...

659
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:53,011
spread the seed around
and keep the species going.

660
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:55,144
And all that shit
they feed us in the movies

661
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,813
and greeting cards
is just propaganda

662
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,449
to get us to marry, have kids
and keep the economy going.

663
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,958
Marriage is just
the keystone to economics.

664
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,391
You're such a sappy girl.

665
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:05,521
- Mm.
- Are you trying to tell me

666
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:07,292
you don't believe in love,
Beckalah?

667
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:08,629
In romantic love,

668
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:09,928
no.

669
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:12,095
Like, I love my parents.

670
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:14,730
I love my car.
I love you.

671
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:17,400
But romantic love,
hearts and flowers,

672
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:20,240
"There's only one person
out there for me"?

673
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:22,974
Come on, you know how many
people there are out there?

674
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:24,413
Odds are there's always going

675
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:26,440
to be someone who's
a better match for you

676
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:28,179
than the person
you end up marrying.

677
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,379
So based on your theory,

678
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,820
there's someone out there
better for me than Emma.

679
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:34,689
Oh, no,
I'm not touching that one.

680
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,159
Wait a second.

681
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:37,889
You don't think
I really love her?

682
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:40,090
<i>I think...</i>

683
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:42,292
you love what she represents.

684
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:43,732
Which is?

685
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:45,963
Come on, Dante, she was
the girl who wouldn't give you

686
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:47,494
the time of day
back in high school.

687
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:49,403
And years later,
after she's played the field

688
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,170
and realized how unsatisfying
the so-called "hotties" are,

689
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,371
she's finally gone
with someone who looks...

690
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:55,674
Oh, my God,

691
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:57,476
you're gonna say
"fugly," aren't you?

692
00:31:57,515 --> 00:31:58,573
Unconventional!

693
00:31:58,616 --> 00:31:59,844
Ah, nice backpedal.

694
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:01,579
<i>Thank you.</i>

695
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,280
It took her a few years

696
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:04,618
to finally figure out
that thing

697
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:06,715
that every mother tries
to teach their little girl

698
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,089
but she has to learn on her own,

699
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:10,458
and that's that guys
that look like you

700
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:12,520
have a lot more to offer,
because you'll always

701
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:14,087
try harder than the pretty boy.

702
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:16,896
What am I, some hideous
fucking CHUD over here?

703
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,870
<i>No, you're a catch... kind of.</i>

704
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:22,270
And Emma's a catch, too.

705
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:24,298
'Cause not only
is she pretty, but...

706
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:26,867
she'll make all your decisions
for you.

707
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:29,744
Which is lucky,
because you're pretty terrible

708
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,646
at making decisions.

709
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:33,617
So my last day
is all about you telling me

710
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:35,380
what an ugly,
indecisive loser I am?

711
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:38,385
Come on, you worked
at Quick Stop

712
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:39,981
for, like, a decade,

713
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:43,289
and you've been here
for a year almost,

714
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:45,853
and since day one at both jobs,

715
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:47,592
all you've ever said
is how you needed

716
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,997
to get out
and start your life.

717
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:51,262
And it wasn't until Emma walked
through the door and was,

718
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,894
like, "Come down
to Florida with me,

719
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:54,268
"and I'll fuck your brains out,

720
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,535
and my daddy will give you
a job, and blah-blah,"

721
00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:58,735
that you actually went
and did something about it.

722
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:00,175
And I get it... it's...

723
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:03,237
she's your golden ticket, dude.

724
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:04,714
So, uh...

725
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:07,150
...what's that make you?

726
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:13,851
I'm just the girl who fucks
ugly, indecisive losers

727
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:16,689
in the kitchen
once this place is closed.

728
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:18,954
<i>That's me.</i>

729
00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:27,535
DJ:
That's something for
the lovers out there.

730
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:29,699
J-RAM Radio.
Right around high noon...

731
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:33,040
So, we're never gonna talk
about it, are we?

732
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:37,773
What is there to say?

733
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:39,680
Do you regret it?

734
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:41,446
Do you?

735
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:44,455
I regret that it was
on the prep station table.

736
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:46,252
Yeah, you regret it...
you weren't the one

737
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,518
who got mayo in your cooch.

738
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:59,328
What do you want me to say?

739
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,361
We were drunk, you know?

740
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:03,306
It just kind of happened.

741
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:05,639
You're just lucky

742
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:08,236
I'm not one of those monogamists
like your girlfriend.

743
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:11,442
Otherwise, I might try
to make you stay in Jersey.

744
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:13,712
If anyone could do it,
it'd be you.

745
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:26,429
Dude, your old lady's out here
looking for you.

746
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:32,563
<i>Yeah.</i>

747
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:40,801
Come outside with me.
I've got a surprise for you.

748
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:53,714
That's my surprise?

749
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,282
No.

750
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:59,892
<i> Goodbye, horses... </i>

751
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:07,632
Hey.

752
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,597
Oh.

753
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:12,700
So, um...

754
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:15,337
are you looking for
a good Transformers site?

755
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:18,405
Because at CarsToBots. Com,

756
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,213
you can get an avatar

757
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:25,416
that's your picture
morphed to look like a robot.

758
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,923
Come on, man.

759
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,687
You know I only surf
Transformers sites

760
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:32,127
when there's girls around,
so they can see how cool I am.

761
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:36,266
So what are you doing then?

762
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,736
Trying to secure a going away
present for Mr. Dante.

763
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:40,862
Really?

764
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:44,397
Well, how about
an Arwen sword replica?

765
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:46,307
What?

766
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:49,108
Uh...

767
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:52,139
'Cause it's, like,
thoughtful and practical.

768
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:56,984
I was thinking of something
a little more sexy.

769
00:35:57,021 --> 00:36:01,117
Well, what's sexier than
an elf princess's sword?

770
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,922
A donkey show.

771
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,018
What's that?

772
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:06,495
You ever see a chick
give a mule a blow job?

773
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:08,260
<i>Oh, no!</i>

774
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:10,358
Shh!

775
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:11,766
Jesus!

776
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:14,202
If you spoil this,
I'm gonna brain you.

777
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:16,229
You gonna keep your mouth shut?

778
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:17,935
<i>Yes.</i>

779
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:18,941
God.

780
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,205
That's bestiality, Randal.

781
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:23,304
At its finest, I hope.

782
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,315
Who'd want to see
something like that?

783
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,817
Me, Dante, you.

784
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,444
I don't want to see
something like that.

785
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:31,352
Why would you want to see
something like that?

786
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:32,947
Because it's fucked up.

787
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,150
And I want to see

788
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,752
if a chick with a mouthful
of donkey spunk swallows.

789
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:38,159
All right, here we go.

790
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,596
"Kinky Kelly and the Sexy Stud.

791
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:43,122
"Straight from
their dirty debut in Tijuana,

792
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:45,067
"Kelly's taking it on the road.

793
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:47,570
Taking it in the ass, that is."

794
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:50,768
You got to give it up for Oscar
Wilde-like wordplay that good.

795
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:52,435
Do they show pictures?

796
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:55,309
Only one of Kinky Kelly
sucking off Optimus Prime.

797
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:56,313
Really?

798
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:57,939
Ow.

799
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:59,449
Let me borrow your cell phone.

800
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:00,472
Whoa.

801
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:02,418
Well, 'cause, I'm only
supposed to use it

802
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:04,546
to call my parents
in case of an emergency.

803
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:05,715
This is an emergency.

804
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:07,587
We got to lock up
Kinky Kelly for tonight,

805
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:10,526
so we can give Mr. Dante
a memorable send-off.

806
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:13,359
You love Mr. Dante, don't you?

807
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,659
In a non-gay way.

808
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:16,098
Then give me your phone.

809
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:18,226
'Cause Mr. Dante's never
seen a donkey show.

810
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:20,760
And it'd be nice to give
him this before he goes off

811
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:23,103
to Florida and gets married and
does all those other things

812
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,630
that prevent a guy
from ever seeing

813
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:26,472
a fucked-up donkey
show in his lifetime.

814
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,841
Hello.

815
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:30,938
Uh, I was hoping to schedule
Kinky Kelly for a performance.

816
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:32,913
Tonight.

817
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,577
Okay.

818
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:36,246
I'm on hold.

819
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:39,313
Fingers crossed.

820
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:42,758
We should probably
cross dicks, too.

821
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:43,760
No.

822
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:45,785
BECKY:
Work, work, work.

823
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,559
That's all you ever
think about, Hicks.

824
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:48,428
Hey, Becks.

825
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:50,195
Hey, Emma.

826
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:53,329
Great shirt.

827
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:54,804
Isn't it?
I love it.

828
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:57,137
What I love even more are these.

829
00:37:57,174 --> 00:37:58,163
These came in early,

830
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:00,370
and I just had to come back
and show Dante.

831
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:02,242
And give you yours, of course.

832
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,680
And I have one
for Randal, I guess.

833
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:06,444
What is it?

834
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:07,883
Look, I know it's
three months away,

835
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:10,751
but it would mean so much to us
if you could make the trip down.

836
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:13,256
Well... yeah.

837
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:16,059
Uh, I wouldn't miss it.

838
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:18,357
I thought we were waiting
till we got down there

839
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:19,693
before we picked a date.

840
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,595
Oh, him is so cute.

841
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,031
Him thinking again, huh?

842
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:26,063
If we left anything
up to these jackals,

843
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:27,798
nothing would ever
get done, would it?

844
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:31,097
I'm just teasing.

845
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:38,214
Guess you got to make their
decisions for 'em sometimes.

846
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:46,914
All right, I've got it.

847
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:47,946
I will see you then.

848
00:38:48,025 --> 00:38:49,549
Thank you.

849
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:51,390
My friend, tonight,

850
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:53,954
we bring a bit of TJ
to the Jersey 'burbs.

851
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:56,924
Well, I don't know
about this, Randal.

852
00:38:56,967 --> 00:38:58,958
I mean, how do we know
this isn't a hoax?

853
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,935
Like, were there any
pictures on the Web site?

854
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:02,404
Strangely, no.

855
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,000
But if you've seen pics of
one chick sucking off a donkey,

856
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:07,203
you've seen them all.

857
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:08,905
Well, what if you
haven't ever seen pics

858
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:10,675
of anything like that?

859
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:12,910
Well, then you must be
as blind as Anne Frank.

860
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:15,145
'Cause what's the point in
having an Internet connection

861
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,620
if you're not using it to look
at weird, fucked-up pictures

862
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:19,646
of dirty sex
you'll never have yourself?

863
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:29,925
Ho-ly shit.

864
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,595
You know, I've never pieced
this together until right now.

865
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:35,104
You're a virgin, aren't you?

866
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:36,936
You know I have
a girlfriend, Randal.

867
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:37,872
Oh, yeah.

868
00:39:37,908 --> 00:39:39,102
What's her name again?

869
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:41,111
Myra Hodgkiss.

870
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:42,908
You made her up, didn't you?

871
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:44,642
That name sounds so made-up.

872
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:47,150
No.

873
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:49,516
Seriously, Elias, have you
and Myra had sex yet?

874
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:51,919
Well, that's just
kind of personal, Randal.

875
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:52,945
Come on!

876
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:55,424
I tell you about
my sex life all the time.

877
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:56,756
I let you smell my fingers

878
00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:58,455
after I fucked
Taton Weathers' kid sister

879
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:00,123
in the office
that one time, didn't I?

880
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:02,724
You kind of made me
smell your fingers.

881
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:06,628
Maybe you just
don't like the pussy.

882
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,467
Maybe you're all about the cock.

883
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:10,736
No, no, I like the pussy.

884
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:11,867
So come on.

885
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,275
Did Myra ever give you a crack
at her crack or what?

886
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:17,109
Well, not that it's any
of your business, Randal,

887
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:18,308
but she can't.

888
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:19,816
Why?

889
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:23,517
Jesus, Elias, come on.

890
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:25,522
You got to start
trusting me more.

891
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:27,080
Because once Dante's gone,

892
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:28,716
you're gonna be
my new best friend.

893
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:32,622
No, I'm not.

894
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:34,824
Who the fuck else
am I gonna hang out with?

895
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:36,389
It's gonna be you and me, buddy.

896
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,423
So come on.

897
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:38,628
You got to start
trusting me more.

898
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:40,864
Open up and tell me shit.

899
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:44,602
Like why haven't you
fucked Myra yet?

900
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:51,609
Well, we can't
because of Pillow Pants.

901
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:53,674
What the fuck's Pillow Pants?

902
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:57,813
Pillow Pants is a little troll
who lives in her pussy.

903
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:09,693
Pillow Pants is her pussy troll.

904
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:11,200
Duh.

905
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:15,866
You know
how every girl's parents

906
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:20,400
put a pussy troll in them
when the girls are young

907
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:23,436
to keep them from having
premarital sex?

908
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,848
Sure.

909
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:30,251
Well, Myra's is named
Pillow Pants.

910
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:34,986
And so, even though she totally
wants to have sex with me,

911
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:39,758
Myra says if I put
my thing in her,

912
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:41,992
Pillow Pants will bite it off.

913
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:47,495
So I got to wait
until Pillow Pants

914
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:51,440
gets peed out of her body
on her 21st birthday

915
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:54,376
before we can have sex.

916
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:57,005
And Myra told you this?

917
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:58,105
Boyfriends and girlfriends

918
00:41:58,148 --> 00:42:00,708
talk to each other
about sex stuff, Randal.

919
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:02,844
You'd know this
if you ever had a girlfriend.

920
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:05,947
Have you and Myra
even kissed yet?

921
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:09,457
We would have already,
if it wasn't for Lister Fiend.

922
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:13,963
Lister Fiend is her mouth troll,
isn't it?

923
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:15,929
Women.

924
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,131
I'll be right back.

925
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:26,969
You are never gonna believe
what Elias just told me.

926
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,102
Look who it is, Randal.

927
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:31,071
Randal Graves.

928
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:32,605
You work here, too?

929
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:35,744
Jesus. Anyone else from
our graduating class back there?

930
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:36,753
RANDAL:
Well, well, well...

931
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:38,914
Pickle Fucker.

932
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:41,083
Man, look at you two
fun-ployees.

933
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:42,422
Nothing's changed.

934
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:44,450
You know, I'll bet
dollars to donuts,

935
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:45,689
when you two aren't fighting

936
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:48,493
about who shot first,
Han or Greedo,

937
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:50,523
you can still muster up
enough energy

938
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,798
to make fun of other people.

939
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:54,997
Yeah. So hurry up and order
and get out of here,

940
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:56,766
so we can make fun of you.

941
00:42:56,807 --> 00:42:58,638
Oh, I don't know
if you're in a position

942
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:00,644
to make fun of anyone
anymore, Graves.

943
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:03,408
32 and you're
flipping burgers?

944
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:05,438
Before that, I'd heard
it was the Quick Stop

945
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:07,541
for, what, like, ten years?

946
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:10,782
We can't all be
Internet millionaires.

947
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,283
Who's an Internet millionaire?

948
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:15,155
Elias, this is Lance Dowds.

949
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:16,523
We went to high school together.

950
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,857
A few years ago,

951
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:20,329
he built a search engine which
compiles the lowest prices

952
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:22,924
of merchandise
you can buy online.

953
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:25,401
You might have heard of it...
MadDucketts. Com.

954
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,700
Didn't that just sell to Amazon
for, like, 20 million bucks?

955
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:29,228
RANDAL:
Yeah, but back before

956
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:32,265
he was the Mad Ducketts guy,
he was just Pickle Fucker.

957
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:33,674
You see, freshman year,

958
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:35,770
the seniors would hunt us
down and put us through

959
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:37,440
what they called initiations.

960
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:38,778
They'd stuff us into lockers

961
00:43:38,816 --> 00:43:40,841
or throw us in the girls'
shower room naked.

962
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:42,681
But Lance here
got the worst of it.

963
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,745
The seniors yanked
down his pants,

964
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:46,312
and shoved a pickle up his ass,

965
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:47,688
and made him walk ten feet.

966
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:50,717
The pickle fell out
before he hit the ten-foot mark.

967
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:55,926
He had to take a bite of it,
reinsert it and walk again.

968
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,331
Ew...

969
00:43:57,368 --> 00:43:59,563
Yeah, but don't worry...
he made it.

970
00:43:59,603 --> 00:44:01,798
His pickle was small enough
to stay wedged

971
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:03,397
after only four bites.

972
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,271
I'll bet you're the only guy
in the world

973
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,936
who still remembers that,
Graves.

974
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:09,774
Oh, I bet you still remember it
pretty vividly...

975
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:10,780
Pickle Fucker.

976
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,042
ELIAS:
Do you have any interest

977
00:44:12,082 --> 00:44:14,312
in building
the ultimate fan site

978
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:17,718
<i>for both The Lord of the Rings
and The Transformers?</i>

979
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:19,780
Because I'd moderate it
for free.

980
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:21,886
Ease up, Pillow Pants.

981
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:24,621
The dude's not into
your D&D, GoBots bullshit.

982
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:25,686
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

983
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:26,696
Don't insult the guy.

984
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:29,722
The GoBots are like
the Kmart of Transformers.

985
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:32,327
Thank you!

986
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,638
I keep telling them that.

987
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,470
Here, here's my e-mail address.

988
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:40,534
Drop me a line
with some of your ideas.

989
00:44:40,577 --> 00:44:41,566
Cool.

990
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:49,976
LANCE:
Okay, let's see.

991
00:44:50,087 --> 00:44:52,180
What do I want?

992
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:56,181
Uh... how about a Skinny Calf
with cheese and a Diet Coke?

993
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:58,922
I'll get your order.

994
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:06,026
Here you go.

995
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:08,399
Well, that was fast.

996
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:09,838
And fresh.

997
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,864
Thanks. Come again.

998
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:14,935
Yo, let's wrap this up
so I can get my Cow Tipper on.

999
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:16,172
You know what?

1000
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,202
Take mine.

1001
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:20,483
Something tells me
I'm not gonna like it, am I?

1002
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:23,677
Wow, thanks, Pickle Fucker.

1003
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:27,220
Yo, so Pickle Fucker
gave us free eats!

1004
00:45:27,257 --> 00:45:29,282
You know,
I don't eat fast food.

1005
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:30,657
It's not good for you.

1006
00:45:30,694 --> 00:45:34,596
But when I heard you guys
were actually working here,

1007
00:45:34,631 --> 00:45:36,792
well, I just had
to see it for myself.

1008
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:39,632
It's kind of nice
having that kind of free time.

1009
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:42,138
Just like it's
kind of comforting to know

1010
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:45,335
that some things never change.

1011
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:51,947
Take care, clerks.

1012
00:45:55,986 --> 00:45:57,817
Ooh, sick burn.

1013
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:02,387
Fuck this.

1014
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:03,620
Let me borrow your car.

1015
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:04,718
You're supposed to be working.

1016
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,923
I got to get out of here
for a few minutes.

1017
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:08,327
Let me borrow your car.

1018
00:46:08,365 --> 00:46:10,526
Elias, tell Becky
we'll be right back.

1019
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,430
Where we going?

1020
00:46:25,749 --> 00:46:29,708
You know, this tastes like
piss and flies, don't it?

1021
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,945
Sure you want to do this?

1022
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:33,113
RANDAL:
Oh, yeah.

1023
00:46:33,157 --> 00:46:35,250
This will make me feel better.

1024
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:44,195
<i> Raindrops keep falling
on my head </i>

1025
00:46:44,234 --> 00:46:49,604
<i> And just like the guy who's
feet are too big for his bed </i>

1026
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,973
<i> Nothing seems to fit,
those </i>

1027
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:55,874
<i> Raindrops
are falling on my head </i>

1028
00:46:55,913 --> 00:46:57,210
<i> They keep falling </i>

1029
00:46:57,247 --> 00:47:03,743
<i> But there's one thing I know </i>

1030
00:47:03,787 --> 00:47:07,450
<i> The blues
they send to meet me </i>

1031
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:10,619
<i> Won't defeat me </i>

1032
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:13,061
<i> It won't be long </i>

1033
00:47:13,096 --> 00:47:17,624
<i> Till happiness
steps up to greet me </i>

1034
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:26,269
<i> Raindrops keep falling
on my head </i>

1035
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:31,338
<i> But that doesn't mean my eyes
will soon be turning red </i>

1036
00:47:31,381 --> 00:47:35,044
<i> Crying's not for me,
'cause </i>

1037
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:39,419
<i> I'm never gonna stop
the rain by complaining </i>

1038
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:44,393
<i> Because I'm free </i>

1039
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:47,761
<i> Nothing's worrying... </i>

1040
00:47:47,798 --> 00:47:50,961
<i> Me. </i>

1041
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:53,093
DANTE:
Here's what I don't
understand about you.

1042
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:56,105
You have a license, you
can drive a grown-up car.

1043
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:57,572
But when you ride the go-carts,

1044
00:47:57,608 --> 00:47:59,838
you somehow feel
better about yourself.

1045
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:01,902
Look, it just centers me,
all right?

1046
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:04,470
Kind of the way jerking off
at work centers you.

1047
00:48:04,514 --> 00:48:06,744
I only did it that one time.

1048
00:48:06,783 --> 00:48:08,114
And it wasn't to center me.

1049
00:48:08,151 --> 00:48:09,778
Yeah, it was to come.

1050
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:12,288
Well, I don't know about you,
but coming centers me.

1051
00:48:12,322 --> 00:48:13,789
Then why did we
have to leave work,

1052
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:15,689
so we can ride the go-carts
to clear your head?

1053
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,921
Well, I don't want to jerk off
in the Mooby's bathroom.

1054
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:19,360
What if a customer comes in

1055
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:22,490
and my jerking off gets him
all sex nuts and retard strong?

1056
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:23,624
Suddenly, I'm fighting him off

1057
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:25,692
as he tries to jam
my dick in his mouth.

1058
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,636
The most likeliest of scenarios.

1059
00:48:28,872 --> 00:48:32,364
Man, that shit Lance said
must have really bothered you.

1060
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:33,433
Oh, fuck him.

1061
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:34,944
He's an asshole.
He always was.

1062
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,912
I'm sorry I let him bug me
even for a second.

1063
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:41,144
At least I got a go-cart trip
out of it.

1064
00:48:43,186 --> 00:48:44,676
Why do the go-carts help?

1065
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:46,279
I don't know.

1066
00:48:46,323 --> 00:48:48,951
They just remind me
of a better time in my life.

1067
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:50,960
Like when?

1068
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:54,155
Like when we were young and the
world was still in front of us.

1069
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:55,721
We're not that old.

1070
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:56,858
Yeah.

1071
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,231
But sometimes I get the feeling

1072
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:00,998
the world kind of left us behind
a long time ago.

1073
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:02,005
You know...

1074
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:04,530
you can do something about that.

1075
00:49:04,574 --> 00:49:07,873
I told you, I don't want to jerk
off in the bathroom at work.

1076
00:49:07,911 --> 00:49:10,778
No, I mean you can
get out of Mooby's, too,

1077
00:49:10,814 --> 00:49:12,839
completely change
your situation in life.

1078
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:16,683
What'd be the point? Besides,
why do you give a shit?

1079
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:17,744
You're leaving.

1080
00:49:30,867 --> 00:49:32,266
Thanks, you guys, thanks.

1081
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:33,269
Come on!

1082
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:34,793
Oh, I'm sorry.

1083
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:35,930
Was that a number two
you wanted?

1084
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:37,563
Yeah, and bovine-size it.

1085
00:49:37,607 --> 00:49:38,574
$13.84.

1086
00:49:38,608 --> 00:49:40,667
I need two Surlies
and a Cow Tipper.

1087
00:49:40,711 --> 00:49:41,678
I'm on it.

1088
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:42,679
How we set for fries?

1089
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:44,180
I don't think
these look right.

1090
00:49:44,214 --> 00:49:47,877
Jesus! Step away from the fryer
before you burn us all alive.

1091
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:50,113
It's not my fault
you abandoned your post!

1092
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:52,178
RANDAL:
Was it too much to ask
that you handle the fries?

1093
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:53,689
The machine does all the work.

1094
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:55,351
What's a machine
got to transform

1095
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:58,486
into some giant fucking robot
before you'll take it seriously?

1096
00:49:58,528 --> 00:49:59,620
Go home.

1097
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,290
Will you just make
some fries already?

1098
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:02,821
Look, I don't have all night.

1099
00:50:02,866 --> 00:50:03,833
I'm sorry, ma'am.

1100
00:50:03,867 --> 00:50:05,596
They need to get
some Mexicans working in here.

1101
00:50:05,635 --> 00:50:06,602
<i>They'd be...</i>

1102
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:07,603
They don't play around.

1103
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:10,902
I know it.
Mexican made me lose my job.

1104
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:13,205
That motherfucker
put a roof up in 30 seconds.

1105
00:50:13,243 --> 00:50:14,540
Where the fuck did you guys go?

1106
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:15,738
You don't want to know.

1107
00:50:15,779 --> 00:50:16,837
Well, I know it's
your last day and all,

1108
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:17,972
but while you're
still on the clock,

1109
00:50:18,081 --> 00:50:19,844
can't you kind of pretend
like you still give a shit?

1110
00:50:19,883 --> 00:50:20,872
RANDAL:
Don't blame this guy.

1111
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:22,976
Some cock stain that we went
to high school with

1112
00:50:23,053 --> 00:50:24,953
showed up to remind us
that we're fucking failures,

1113
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:26,580
so I wanted to get out of here

1114
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:28,454
and blow off some steam,
if you must know.

1115
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:30,392
Did he say "cock stain"?

1116
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:32,395
What the fuck is cock stain?

1117
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:34,260
I don't know... that's
some white freaky stuff.

1118
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:36,925
White boys get the white women
to do everything.

1119
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:38,332
You want to do a cock stain?

1120
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:40,427
Do you know how often
I've had people come in here

1121
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:41,664
that I went to school with?

1122
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,798
Fuck, I had to take
a fucking order off of a guy

1123
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,000
I blew after junior prom once.

1124
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:46,942
Yeah, I've waited on
your brother, too... h'noop!

1125
00:50:46,977 --> 00:50:48,001
I can't believe you.

1126
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:49,578
The smartest of smart asses
got rattled

1127
00:50:49,613 --> 00:50:51,012
by some fucking loser
coming in here

1128
00:50:51,114 --> 00:50:52,581
giving you shit
about your McJob.

1129
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:53,913
Oh, fuck him, okay?

1130
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:56,111
Sooner or later,
I'll do something with myself

1131
00:50:56,153 --> 00:50:57,415
and make my mark.

1132
00:50:57,454 --> 00:51:00,685
But until then, whatever I do
is not a waste of time,

1133
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:02,214
it's all building
toward something.

1134
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:04,921
How about you build towards
making some fuckin' fries?

1135
00:51:04,961 --> 00:51:05,950
They're coming!

1136
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:07,964
Remember, you saved.

1137
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:09,225
You don't use
that kind of language.

1138
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:10,858
Ain't nobody
from my church in here.

1139
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,334
I don't mind people snickering

1140
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:14,132
at the stupid uniform
I've got to wear.

1141
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:15,763
But I'll be damned
if I'm gonna let

1142
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:18,172
some self-righteous,
lucky turd come in here

1143
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:19,505
and treat me and Dante

1144
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:21,534
like we're a couple
of fucking porch monkeys.

1145
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:22,943
DANTE:
Randal!

1146
00:51:22,979 --> 00:51:24,207
Uh, I'm-I'm sorry. He...

1147
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:27,683
He didn't really just say
what I think he said.

1148
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:29,514
- What? Porch monkeys?
- Randal!

1149
00:51:29,553 --> 00:51:30,986
What the fuck
is wrong with you?!

1150
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,988
I want my money back right now.

1151
00:51:33,023 --> 00:51:34,217
Of course.
Um, you know what?

1152
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:35,588
Here, take this on us.

1153
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:36,853
Oh, no, no, no.

1154
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:37,951
I'm not eating something that

1155
00:51:37,994 --> 00:51:40,121
was cooked by some
cracker-ass hate-monger.

1156
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:41,187
I will.

1157
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:42,698
Baby, you can't taste racism.

1158
00:51:42,732 --> 00:51:44,632
What racism? Porch monkeys?!

1159
00:51:44,668 --> 00:51:46,533
- You little mother...
- Calm down, champ.

1160
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:47,537
It ain't worth it.

1161
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:48,595
You're lucky my husband doesn't

1162
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:50,970
jump across this counter
and knock your teeth in.

1163
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:53,305
- Why?
- Yeah, baby, why?

1164
00:51:53,343 --> 00:51:54,867
I mean, ain't like
he called us porch monkeys.

1165
00:51:54,911 --> 00:51:55,935
Hey, hey!

1166
00:51:55,979 --> 00:51:56,809
Baby, stop hitting on me!

1167
00:51:56,847 --> 00:51:58,007
See, the judge told you
about that.

1168
00:51:58,081 --> 00:51:59,571
You got to stop
putting your hands on people.

1169
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:01,140
Here, take this.
This is your money.

1170
00:52:01,184 --> 00:52:02,446
Please, take the food on us.

1171
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:03,453
- We're sorry.
- Oh, uh-uh.

1172
00:52:03,487 --> 00:52:04,545
I'm gonna write
to the paper about this,

1173
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:06,078
and all y'all getting
fired up in here.

1174
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:07,215
Jesus!

1175
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:08,485
I'm gonna take the food.

1176
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:11,358
Thank you very much.

1177
00:52:13,763 --> 00:52:15,060
Damn!

1178
00:52:15,098 --> 00:52:16,065
Fuckin' porch monkey...

1179
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:17,726
Thanks. Come again.

1180
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:19,564
Don't leave me, baby!

1181
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:21,332
Are you out of
your fucking mind?!

1182
00:52:21,371 --> 00:52:22,702
What?! What's the big deal?

1183
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:25,207
Since when is it a crime
to say "porch monkey"?

1184
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:27,073
Oh, I don't know...
since forever!

1185
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:28,634
- Why?
- Because "porch monkey"

1186
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:30,509
is a racial slur
against black people.

1187
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:32,640
No, it's not. "Nigger" is.

1188
00:52:32,682 --> 00:52:33,706
Randal!

1189
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:36,082
Did Randal just call
Mr. Dante a nigger?

1190
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:37,416
Shut up, Elias!

1191
00:52:37,454 --> 00:52:39,718
I didn't just call
Dante a nigger.

1192
00:52:39,756 --> 00:52:42,088
I just said that "nigger"
is a racial slur.

1193
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:43,422
So is "porch monkey"!

1194
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,893
Oh, it is not.

1195
00:52:44,928 --> 00:52:48,625
Coon, spook, spade,
moolie, jiggaboo, nignug...

1196
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:49,723
<i>those are racial slurs.</i>

1197
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:50,994
"Porch monkey" is not.

1198
00:52:51,034 --> 00:52:52,831
I am going to pretend
like this conversation

1199
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:54,336
didn't happen.

1200
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:55,736
Elias, go pick up
that fucking mess,

1201
00:52:55,772 --> 00:52:57,364
and you are this close
to getting shit-canned!

1202
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:00,733
Fuckin' shoot me now.

1203
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:03,740
What are you doing?!

1204
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:05,145
Are you trying to get fired?

1205
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:08,379
Since when did "porch monkey"
suddenly become a racial slur?

1206
00:53:08,418 --> 00:53:10,909
When ignorant racists started
saying it 100 years ago.

1207
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:12,148
Oh, bullshit.

1208
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,680
My grandmother used to call me
a porch monkey all the time

1209
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:16,692
when I was a kid,
because I'd sit on the porch

1210
00:53:16,726 --> 00:53:17,784
and stare at my neighbors.

1211
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:18,794
DANTE:
Despite the fact

1212
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:20,523
that your grandmother
might have used it

1213
00:53:20,564 --> 00:53:21,963
as a term
of endearment for you,

1214
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:23,522
it's still a racial slur.

1215
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:25,967
It'd be like your grandmother
calling you a little kike.

1216
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:26,968
Oh, it is not.

1217
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:28,196
Plus, my grandmother had

1218
00:53:28,238 --> 00:53:30,968
nothing but the utmost respect
for the Jewish community.

1219
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,702
When I was a kid,
she told me to always treat

1220
00:53:32,742 --> 00:53:35,677
the Jewish kids well, or they'd
put the sheeny curse on me.

1221
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:37,373
What the fuck, man?!

1222
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:38,176
What?!

1223
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:39,876
"Sheeny" is a racial slur, too!

1224
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:40,940
Oh, it is not.

1225
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:42,212
Yes, it is!

1226
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:43,981
Well, she never called
any Jews sheeny.

1227
00:53:44,087 --> 00:53:45,816
She just used to say
"sheeny curse" a lot.

1228
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:46,822
<i>It was cute.</i>

1229
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:48,915
It wasn't cute! It was racist!

1230
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:49,983
I disagree, man.

1231
00:53:50,093 --> 00:53:51,219
She was just an old-timer.

1232
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:52,990
That's the way people talked
back then.

1233
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:55,894
Didn't mean they were racists.

1234
00:53:55,932 --> 00:53:58,992
But my grandmother did refer
to a broken beer bottle once

1235
00:53:59,102 --> 00:54:00,399
as a nigger knife.

1236
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,399
You know, come to think of it,

1237
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,271
my grandmother was
kind of a racist.

1238
00:54:05,308 --> 00:54:06,502
You think?!

1239
00:54:06,543 --> 00:54:08,067
Well, l-I still don't think

1240
00:54:08,111 --> 00:54:10,409
"porch monkey" should be
considered a racial term.

1241
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:12,677
I mean, I've always used it
to describe lazy people,

1242
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:13,944
not lazy black people.

1243
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:15,281
I think if we really tried,

1244
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:17,548
we could reclaim "porch monkey"
and save it.

1245
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:18,849
DANTE:
It can't be saved, Randal.

1246
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:20,515
The sole purpose
for its creation,

1247
00:54:20,557 --> 00:54:22,388
the only reason it exists
in the first place,

1248
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:24,359
is to disparage an entire race.

1249
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:25,691
And even if it could be saved,

1250
00:54:25,729 --> 00:54:27,822
you can't save it,
because you're not black!

1251
00:54:27,864 --> 00:54:29,354
Well, listen to you.

1252
00:54:29,399 --> 00:54:32,562
Telling me I can't do something
because of the color of my skin?

1253
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:33,967
You're the racist.

1254
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:38,874
I'm taking it back. You watch.

1255
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:42,377
<i>Hey.</i>

1256
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:45,210
What can I get for you,
you little porch monkey?

1257
00:54:45,248 --> 00:54:47,682
It's cool.
I'm taking it back.

1258
00:55:27,757 --> 00:55:28,951
Hey.

1259
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:30,048
Hey.

1260
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:32,823
So, are you scared
about getting married at all?

1261
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:37,255
Um...

1262
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,894
were we in the middle
of a conversation

1263
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:41,096
I don't remember leaving?

1264
00:55:41,137 --> 00:55:44,573
I was just thinking about it,
and I was thinking

1265
00:55:44,607 --> 00:55:47,075
that maybe you were waiting
for some friend

1266
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:48,099
to try and stop you

1267
00:55:48,144 --> 00:55:49,543
from going through
with the wedding

1268
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:52,275
by asking if you're even ready
to go and get married.

1269
00:55:52,315 --> 00:55:54,283
So I'm asking.

1270
00:55:54,317 --> 00:55:56,080
Are you scared
about getting married?

1271
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:57,950
Well, kind of.

1272
00:55:57,987 --> 00:56:00,319
I mean, I'm not scared
of getting married, you know...

1273
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:02,791
l-I always wanted
to get married one day...

1274
00:56:02,826 --> 00:56:05,260
but I am scared
of the wedding.

1275
00:56:05,295 --> 00:56:07,286
Why?

1276
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:11,228
I don't know how to dance.

1277
00:56:12,936 --> 00:56:14,164
You're kidding.

1278
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,501
I wish I was.

1279
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:17,597
You're about to tie
your life to someone,

1280
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:18,732
someone who doesn't
even really get you

1281
00:56:18,775 --> 00:56:19,833
as well as your friends do,

1282
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:23,107
and what you're sweating
is dancing at your reception?

1283
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:25,273
Well, l-I figure
she'll eventually get me.

1284
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:27,112
I mean, you're married
to someone long enough,

1285
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:28,583
they got to get you
eventually, right?

1286
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:29,585
Are you kidding?

1287
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:32,611
My parents have been married
for 35 years,

1288
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:34,282
and they still don't get
each other.

1289
00:56:34,324 --> 00:56:38,454
Emma's pretty,
smart, happy, a good person...

1290
00:56:38,495 --> 00:56:40,963
and for some strange reason,
she loves me.

1291
00:56:40,997 --> 00:56:41,964
I mean, what am
I supposed to do,

1292
00:56:41,998 --> 00:56:43,124
pass up on that because I have

1293
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:44,656
a few stupid doubts
and some jitters?

1294
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:47,602
Besides, dancing
at the reception's

1295
00:56:47,637 --> 00:56:48,626
the more imperative concern
at this point,

1296
00:56:48,671 --> 00:56:49,797
because I only get,

1297
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:52,740
well, presumably, one chance
to dance at my wedding.

1298
00:56:55,512 --> 00:56:57,173
So, what, you can't slow dance?

1299
00:56:57,213 --> 00:56:59,773
No. Anybody can slow dance,

1300
00:56:59,816 --> 00:57:02,182
but this is one of the only
times I've ever gonna meet

1301
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:04,186
most of Emma's extended family,

1302
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:06,017
and I'd like to be able
to show some flair

1303
00:57:06,055 --> 00:57:07,488
on the dance floor, you know?

1304
00:57:07,524 --> 00:57:10,459
Like, make an impression
so that maybe they'll see

1305
00:57:10,493 --> 00:57:12,017
whatever it is
that Emma sees in me

1306
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:15,121
instead of all feeling like
I'm some burger-peddling loser

1307
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:16,462
who couldn't even bust a move.

1308
00:57:18,468 --> 00:57:20,265
What?

1309
00:57:20,303 --> 00:57:22,464
<i>You're serious?</i>

1310
00:57:28,478 --> 00:57:29,502
Come on.

1311
00:57:32,982 --> 00:57:35,143
Hey, 12-step!

1312
00:57:36,986 --> 00:57:38,851
Jay!

1313
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:42,891
Lord?

1314
00:57:42,926 --> 00:57:44,518
Up here, jackass.

1315
00:57:46,429 --> 00:57:49,193
What the fuck are you doing
up there?!

1316
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:50,290
Yo, if you're gonna jump,

1317
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:52,198
let me get a crack
at that pussy first.

1318
00:57:52,235 --> 00:57:53,634
Let me find out.

1319
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:55,900
You still got your boom box?

1320
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:00,910
Play something,
and turn it way up.

1321
00:58:01,911 --> 00:58:05,142
Something danceable.

1322
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:09,912
Up here?

1323
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,717
Are you serious?

1324
00:58:12,755 --> 00:58:14,814
You're gonna teach me
to dance up here?

1325
00:58:14,858 --> 00:58:17,486
What? You want I should do it
in front of all the customers?

1326
00:58:17,527 --> 00:58:18,494
What customers?

1327
00:58:18,528 --> 00:58:20,462
Shut up.
Come over here.

1328
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:23,364
Okay, get ready for the music.

1329
00:58:23,399 --> 00:58:26,630
You feel it... here.

1330
00:58:27,637 --> 00:58:30,333
Here it comes.

1331
00:58:30,373 --> 00:58:33,774
<i> Grandma, what was it like </i>

1332
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:38,474
<i> To be on the holiday site? </i>

1333
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:41,109
Something a little
less demonic, please!

1334
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:43,948
<i> But with them by my side
in the twilight... </i>

1335
00:58:43,987 --> 00:58:45,477
Thank you.

1336
00:58:54,931 --> 00:58:56,523
Yes! Okay, okay, um,
just-just follow

1337
00:58:56,566 --> 00:58:57,692
whatever it is I'm doing, okay?

1338
00:58:57,734 --> 00:58:58,701
- Step forward...
- All right.

1339
00:58:58,735 --> 00:58:59,861
<i>-  You went to school... 
- Step back.</i>

1340
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:00,870
To your right.

1341
00:59:00,904 --> 00:59:02,371
<i> Things you never,
never knew before... </i>

1342
00:59:02,405 --> 00:59:03,667
To your left.

1343
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:04,673
Turn to the right.

1344
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:06,004
<i> Like "l" before "E"
except after "C" </i>

1345
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:07,566
<i> And why two plus two
makes four </i>

1346
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:09,703
<i> Now, now, now,
I'm gonna teach you </i>

1347
00:59:09,746 --> 00:59:11,043
<i> Teach you, teach you </i>

1348
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,206
<i> All about love, girl </i>

1349
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:13,476
<i> All about love </i>

1350
00:59:13,516 --> 00:59:14,642
<i> Sit yourself down... </i>

1351
00:59:14,684 --> 00:59:16,311
Okay, you really do suck.
Sit down.

1352
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:17,649
Told you.

1353
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:18,654
Just watch me, all right?

1354
00:59:18,688 --> 00:59:20,713
<i> A, B, C </i>

1355
00:59:20,757 --> 00:59:22,816
<i> Easy as one, two, three </i>

1356
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:24,918
<i> As simple as do, re, mi </i>

1357
00:59:25,028 --> 00:59:27,326
<i> A, B, C, one, two, three </i>

1358
00:59:27,363 --> 00:59:29,058
<i> Baby, you and me, girl </i>

1359
00:59:29,098 --> 00:59:30,656
<i> A, B, C </i>

1360
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:32,895
<i> Easy as one, two, three </i>

<i> Baby, you and me, girl </i>

1364
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:43,672
<i> Come on and love me
just a little bit </i>

1365
00:59:43,713 --> 00:59:46,307
<i> I'm gonna teach you
how to sing it out </i>

1366
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:47,316
<i> Come on, come on, come on </i>

1367
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:48,942
<i> Let me show you
what it's all about </i>

1368
00:59:48,985 --> 00:59:50,953
<i> Reading, writing, arithmetic </i>

1369
00:59:51,054 --> 00:59:53,284
<i> Are the branches
of the learning tree </i>

1370
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:56,383
<i> But without the roots
of love every day, girl </i>

1371
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,394
<i> Your education
ain't complete </i>

1372
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:00,396
<i> Tea-Tea-Tea-Teacher's
gonna show you </i>

1373
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:01,556
<i> She's gonna show you </i>

1374
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:03,156
<i> How to get an "A" </i>

1375
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:04,564
<i> Na-na-na-na-na-na </i>

1376
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,865
<i> How to spell "me," "you,"
add the two </i>

1377
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:09,235
<i> Listen to me, baby,
that's all you got to do </i>

1378
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,069
<i> Oh, A, B, C </i>

1379
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:13,098
<i> It's easy as one, two, three </i>

<i> Baby, you and me, girl </i>

1383
01:00:19,515 --> 01:00:21,676
<i> A, B, C, it's easy </i>

1384
01:00:21,718 --> 01:00:24,346
<i> It's like counting
up to three </i>

1385
01:00:24,387 --> 01:00:27,686
<i> Singing simple melodies </i>

1386
01:00:27,724 --> 01:00:29,817
<i> That's how easy love can be </i>

1387
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:32,589
<i> That's how easy
love can be </i>

1388
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:35,097
<i> Singing simple melodies </i>

1389
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:39,591
<i> One, two, three, you and me! </i>

1390
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,627
<i> Yeah! </i>

1391
01:00:42,939 --> 01:00:44,736
<i>-  Sit down, girl </i>

1392
01:00:44,774 --> 01:00:47,402
<i> I think I love you </i>

1393
01:00:47,443 --> 01:00:50,412
<i> No, get up, girl </i>

1394
01:00:50,446 --> 01:00:52,243
<i> Show me what you can do </i>

1395
01:00:52,281 --> 01:00:53,908
<i> Shake it, shake it, baby </i>

1396
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:54,917
<i> Come on, now </i>

1397
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:56,578
<i> Shake it, shake it, baby </i>

1398
01:00:56,619 --> 01:00:59,588
<i> Ooh, ooh, shake it,
shake it, baby, yeah </i>

1399
01:00:59,622 --> 01:01:01,590
<i> One, two, three, baby </i>

1400
01:01:01,624 --> 01:01:04,092
<i> Ooh, ooh, A, B, C, baby </i>

1401
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:06,595
<i> Na, na, do, re, mi, baby </i>

1402
01:01:06,629 --> 01:01:09,723
<i> Now that's how easy
love can be </i>

1403
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:11,859
<i>- GROUP:  Whoo! 
-  A, B, C, it's easy </i>

1404
01:01:11,901 --> 01:01:14,199
<i> It's like counting
up to three </i>

1405
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:17,297
<i> Singing simple melodies </i>

1406
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,968
<i> That's how easy love can be </i>

1407
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:21,909
<i> Teacher's gonna teach you
how to sing it out </i>

1408
01:01:21,944 --> 01:01:22,911
<i> Come on, come on, come on </i>

1409
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:24,742
<i> Let me show you
what it's all about </i>

1410
01:01:24,781 --> 01:01:26,373
<i> A, B, C, it's easy </i>

1411
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:27,906
<i> It's like counting
up to three... </i>

1412
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:28,917
I love you, Becky.

1413
01:01:28,951 --> 01:01:30,418
<i> Singing simple melodies... </i>

1414
01:01:30,453 --> 01:01:31,886
I'm pregnant, Dante.

1415
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:32,683
<i> That's how easy... </i>

1416
01:01:35,158 --> 01:01:36,147
Oh!

1417
01:01:52,308 --> 01:01:54,208
I'm having second thoughts.

1418
01:01:54,243 --> 01:01:57,235
About your sexuality?

1419
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,713
About going to Florida.

1420
01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:03,144
Yeah, right.

1421
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:05,120
Why now, all of a sudden?

1422
01:02:08,858 --> 01:02:10,826
Becky's pregnant.

1423
01:02:11,861 --> 01:02:13,089
She is?

1424
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:16,161
Huh.

1425
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:18,429
So, what, are you afraid you're
gonna miss the baby shower?

1426
01:02:18,468 --> 01:02:19,935
I'm the father.

1427
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:24,666
This sucks, man.

1428
01:02:24,707 --> 01:02:27,801
I have pelvic piss syndrome
like a motherfucker,

1429
01:02:27,844 --> 01:02:30,642
so be really fucking quiet.

1430
01:02:31,647 --> 01:02:33,615
Ew, dude, don't try
looking at my dick.

1431
01:02:35,118 --> 01:02:36,949
- JAY: What the fuck?
- RANDAL: What?

1432
01:02:36,986 --> 01:02:38,351
Should we have
left that guy in there?

1433
01:02:38,387 --> 01:02:40,218
Oh, fuck him! How the fuck
did you father a child

1434
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:41,985
with a chick
that's not your fiance?!

1435
01:02:42,024 --> 01:02:43,685
Holy shit!

1436
01:02:43,726 --> 01:02:44,988
She got pregnant
off the toilet seat

1437
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:46,220
you jerked off onto!

1438
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:47,388
I fucking knew it!

1439
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:49,864
No, we had sex one night
after work, a few weeks ago.

1440
01:02:49,899 --> 01:02:50,831
What?! Where?!

1441
01:02:50,867 --> 01:02:52,732
Here, on the prep station table.

1442
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:53,895
Ew! That's my prep table.

1443
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:54,903
I don't know what to do.

1444
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:55,904
What did Beck say?

1445
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:56,996
She says she wants to have it.

1446
01:02:57,106 --> 01:02:58,733
Oh, my God, so she wants
you to break it off

1447
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:00,003
- with Emma and marry her?
- No.

1448
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:01,508
She's gonna tell Emma?

1449
01:03:01,544 --> 01:03:02,511
No!

1450
01:03:02,545 --> 01:03:04,536
Wait a second...
then what's the problem?

1451
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:06,741
- Are you that dense?
- I'm serious.

1452
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:08,410
If Becks isn't busting
your balls about it,

1453
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:09,418
what's the big deal?

1454
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:10,419
You could still
go down to Florida

1455
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:11,750
and live happily ever after.

1456
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:14,450
Knowing I have a love child
up in Jersey?!

1457
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:15,457
How the fuck do you always have,

1458
01:03:15,491 --> 01:03:17,516
like, two good-Iooking
girls who want you?

1459
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,551
You're the most
hideous fucking CHUD

1460
01:03:19,595 --> 01:03:21,062
I've ever met,
and you always have

1461
01:03:21,097 --> 01:03:22,724
a pair of girls
fighting over you.

1462
01:03:22,765 --> 01:03:24,733
Listen, you can never tell
anybody about this.

1463
01:03:24,767 --> 01:03:25,927
Who am I gonna tell?

1464
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:27,560
I'm serious, Randal!
And not just for me.

1465
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:29,230
Becky says she doesn't want
anybody to know.

1466
01:03:29,272 --> 01:03:30,239
Then what'd you tell me for?

1467
01:03:30,273 --> 01:03:32,366
Look, you've fucked me over
in the past,

1468
01:03:32,408 --> 01:03:33,568
but this is huge.

1469
01:03:33,609 --> 01:03:34,735
This is serious!

1470
01:03:34,777 --> 01:03:37,075
Promise me that you'll
keep your mouth shut,

1471
01:03:37,113 --> 01:03:38,410
because if you fuck me over
this time,

1472
01:03:38,447 --> 01:03:40,915
I swear to God, I will beat
the shit out of you.

1473
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:42,781
<i>You and what army?</i>

1474
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:43,786
I'm serious!

1475
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,754
I'm serious, too.
You and what army?

1476
01:03:45,788 --> 01:03:46,982
Promise me!

1477
01:03:47,089 --> 01:03:49,284
All right!
Get off of me, you nut!

1478
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:51,725
JAY:
What the fuck?!

1479
01:03:56,699 --> 01:03:58,394
Can I talk to you for a minute?

1480
01:03:58,434 --> 01:04:00,129
Oh, yeah, sure.
Uh, we were just...

1481
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:02,228
May your first child
be a masculine child.

1482
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:09,443
Becky!

1483
01:04:09,478 --> 01:04:10,604
Randal!

1484
01:04:10,646 --> 01:04:12,136
She was sweating me.
It just came out.

1485
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:13,614
Ow! Shit!

1486
01:04:13,649 --> 01:04:14,877
You swung at me!

1487
01:04:14,917 --> 01:04:17,044
- You ducked!
- Because you swung at me!

1488
01:04:17,086 --> 01:04:18,576
Damn it!

1489
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:22,587
Where's Becky?

1490
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:23,592
She just left.

1491
01:04:23,626 --> 01:04:24,752
I need help here, Mr. Dante.

1492
01:04:24,794 --> 01:04:27,092
I can't wrap good,
and Randal ate the last pickles.

1493
01:04:27,129 --> 01:04:28,756
You fucking snitch.

1494
01:04:28,798 --> 01:04:30,425
I'm sorry, Randal.
I'm sorry.

1495
01:04:30,466 --> 01:04:33,128
Becky!

1496
01:04:39,642 --> 01:04:41,803
Maybe she went to get
a home pregnancy test

1497
01:04:41,844 --> 01:04:42,811
just to be sure.

1498
01:04:42,845 --> 01:04:45,837
How the fuck
could this day get any worse?

1499
01:04:49,485 --> 01:04:50,975
Well, what the fuck
are you doing, man?!

1500
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:51,987
Follow her!

1501
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:52,988
You-you think?

1502
01:04:53,022 --> 01:04:53,989
You're darn right, I do.

1503
01:04:54,023 --> 01:04:55,320
You two have got
to work this out.

1504
01:04:55,358 --> 01:04:56,484
Follow her, talk
to her for an hour,

1505
01:04:56,525 --> 01:04:57,492
then come back here.

1506
01:04:57,526 --> 01:04:58,493
An hour?!

1507
01:04:58,527 --> 01:05:00,256
L-I've found that any
more time than that,

1508
01:05:00,296 --> 01:05:02,161
you run the risk of saying
the wrong thing again.

1509
01:05:02,198 --> 01:05:03,825
Follow her,
talk to her for an hour,

1510
01:05:03,866 --> 01:05:05,299
then come back here
and help me close up.

1511
01:05:05,334 --> 01:05:06,596
You can't close up by yourself?

1512
01:05:06,636 --> 01:05:08,661
Fucking A, man,
you're about to become a father!

1513
01:05:08,704 --> 01:05:10,672
Time to start acting
responsibly!

1514
01:05:10,706 --> 01:05:13,607
Be back here in an hour.
Go!

1515
01:05:33,529 --> 01:05:34,791
Hello.

1516
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:36,798
I assume
you're with Kinky Kelly.

1517
01:05:36,832 --> 01:05:39,266
Good guess. You Randal?

1518
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:40,496
I am.

1519
01:05:40,536 --> 01:05:41,833
How long is it gonna take you
to set up?

1520
01:05:41,871 --> 01:05:43,463
Got to hook up the boom box,

1521
01:05:43,506 --> 01:05:45,167
hang a few curtains
and some lights.

1522
01:05:45,207 --> 01:05:47,698
I've got a small smoke machine
for ambiance. Yeah.

1523
01:05:47,743 --> 01:05:49,938
Well, you might as
well start setting up.

1524
01:05:49,979 --> 01:05:50,946
We got about an hour

1525
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:52,504
before the guest of honor
gets back.

1526
01:05:52,548 --> 01:05:56,143
So, do I, uh, get to meet Kelly
before the show or what?

1527
01:05:56,185 --> 01:05:56,981
Nah.

1528
01:05:57,019 --> 01:05:58,816
Kelly likes privacy
before show time.

1529
01:05:58,854 --> 01:06:00,344
But after the show, if you want,

1530
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:02,653
for an extra $500,
you can fuck Kelly.

1531
01:06:02,692 --> 01:06:04,626
Really? Sweet.

1532
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:06,924
Yeah. So, where
we doing this thing?

1533
01:06:06,996 --> 01:06:09,191
Oh, right inside the restaurant.

1534
01:06:10,232 --> 01:06:11,358
You're kidding.

1535
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,595
Not spacious enough?

1536
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:15,501
No, it's plenty spacious.

1537
01:06:15,538 --> 01:06:17,267
Just kind of weird, isn't it?

1538
01:06:17,306 --> 01:06:18,273
Kind of weird?

1539
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:20,605
You're in the bestiality
business, dude.

1540
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:22,110
Hey, fucko...

1541
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:23,779
...we like to call it

1542
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:25,644
inter-species erotica.

1543
01:06:25,681 --> 01:06:27,478
Intriguing.

1544

1552

1567
01:08:35,511 --> 01:08:37,672
Oh, no.

1568
01:08:37,713 --> 01:08:38,680
Not again.

1569
01:08:40,716 --> 01:08:42,343
Yeah, I have a fire
at the Mooby's

1570
01:08:42,384 --> 01:08:44,181
on Memorial Parkway
and Leonardo.

1571
01:08:57,867 --> 01:08:59,494
What?

1572
01:09:03,205 --> 01:09:05,867
What the fuck is going on?

1573
01:09:05,908 --> 01:09:07,432
It's your going-away party.

1574
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:10,104
Whoo! Whoo!

1575
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:14,173
We's all gonna get drunk
and get laid!

1576
01:09:14,216 --> 01:09:16,741
Oh, my God, is Elias hammered?

1577
01:09:16,785 --> 01:09:17,752
Isn't it awesome?

1578
01:09:17,786 --> 01:09:19,651
My man smoked two blunts
full of skunk.

1579
01:09:20,923 --> 01:09:21,890
Fuck Pillow Pants!

1580
01:09:21,924 --> 01:09:24,051
Honk if you love
a tight pussy...

1581
01:09:24,093 --> 01:09:26,561
Yo, we love pussy.

1582
01:09:26,595 --> 01:09:28,222
Tonight, before
you leave me forever,

1583
01:09:28,264 --> 01:09:30,232
we are gonna peep something
we've been talking about

1584
01:09:30,266 --> 01:09:31,733
since we saw "Bachelor Party"

1585
01:09:31,767 --> 01:09:34,065
at your parents' house
on Beta, when we were 12.

1586
01:09:34,103 --> 01:09:36,230
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1587
01:09:36,272 --> 01:09:37,899
I'm gonna miss you, man.

1588
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:41,398
I'm gonna miss you, too,
but this is a little much.

1589
01:09:41,443 --> 01:09:43,172
Yeah? Just wait.

1590
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:53,681
Show time!

1591
01:09:54,723 --> 01:09:56,418
Ladies and gentlemen...

1592
01:09:56,458 --> 01:09:57,425
and you, Elias,

1593
01:09:57,459 --> 01:09:59,393
straight from the debauchery

1594
01:09:59,428 --> 01:10:02,556
capital of the world,
Tijuana, Mexico...

1595
01:10:02,598 --> 01:10:03,860
Oh, God, no.

1596
01:10:03,899 --> 01:10:05,799
Oh, God, yes.

1597
01:10:05,834 --> 01:10:08,735
Get ready for some
hard-core bestiality.

1598
01:10:08,771 --> 01:10:11,331
DRIVER:
Inter-species erotica, fucko!

1599
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:14,865
Inter-species erotica
at its finest,

1600
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:16,377
straight from TJ,

1601
01:10:16,412 --> 01:10:20,405
I give you Kinky Kelly
and the Sexy Stud!

1602
01:10:22,651 --> 01:10:23,640
<i> Maybe </i>

1603
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:26,187
<i>-  Just maybe... 
- Whoo!</i>

1604
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:30,352
<i> Naughty girls
need love, too... </i>

1605
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:40,864
Don't worry.
Chick's coming.

1606
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:52,172
<i> I've been told
time and time again </i>

1607
01:10:52,214 --> 01:10:55,342
<i> That you can't treat love
like a game... </i>

1608
01:10:55,384 --> 01:10:57,215
Any second,
the chick's coming.

1609
01:10:57,253 --> 01:11:00,518
<i> But I play rough
with hearts that never mend </i>

1610
01:11:00,556 --> 01:11:04,959
<i> 'Cause some guys like you
do the same </i>

1611
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:08,257
<i> Love was
just a four-letter word </i>

1612
01:11:08,297 --> 01:11:10,322
<i> Never heard, how absurd... </i>

1613
01:11:10,366 --> 01:11:12,231
Any minute now.

1614
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:13,963
<i> How could it be? </i>

1615
01:11:14,069 --> 01:11:17,698
<i> But now I can't believe
this is real </i>

1616
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:19,935
<i> How I feel, now you steal </i>

1617
01:11:19,975 --> 01:11:22,569
<i> My heart away from me </i>

1618
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:24,977
<i> Used to be so good
and so bad </i>

1619
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:28,538
<i> Sex was something
I just had... </i>

1620
01:11:28,584 --> 01:11:31,553
Wow, that guy's being awfully
forward with that donkey.

1621
01:11:31,587 --> 01:11:32,986
Uh, Randal?!

1622
01:11:33,088 --> 01:11:36,353
Where the fuck's the chick?

1623
01:11:39,261 --> 01:11:43,721
<i> Baby, don't let me
be misunderstood </i>

1624
01:11:43,766 --> 01:11:45,233
<i> Temporary love's so bad... </i>

1625
01:11:45,267 --> 01:11:47,997
Yo, Freddie fucking Mercury,
where's Kelly?

1626
01:11:48,037 --> 01:11:49,163
<i> Then along came you... </i>

1627
01:11:49,204 --> 01:11:50,171
Right here.

1628
01:11:50,205 --> 01:11:51,194
<i> Now I know it's true... </i>

1629
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:54,004
I thought that's the sexy stud.

1630
01:11:54,043 --> 01:11:57,308
<i>I'm the sexy stud.</i>

1631
01:11:57,346 --> 01:11:59,678
<i> Then came you... </i>

1632
01:11:59,715 --> 01:12:01,615
But this donkey's a dude.

1633
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:04,881
Kelly can be
a guy's name, too. Hey!

1634
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:06,046
<i> Yes, it's true </i>

1635
01:12:06,088 --> 01:12:07,214
<i> I'm in love with you </i>

1636
01:12:07,256 --> 01:12:10,089
<i> And believe it, baby </i>

1637
01:12:10,125 --> 01:12:12,889
<i> This time,
your love won't get away... </i>

1638
01:12:13,929 --> 01:12:15,897
Due to some
nomenclature confusion,

1639
01:12:15,931 --> 01:12:18,729
there's not gonna be any chick.

1640
01:12:18,767 --> 01:12:21,258
Well, who the fuck's
gonna blow the donkey?

1641
01:12:21,303 --> 01:12:24,739
<i> Ooh, it's only you I adore </i>

1642
01:12:24,773 --> 01:12:28,709
<i> So much more
than my body was asking for... </i>

1643
01:12:28,744 --> 01:12:29,972
Oh!

1644
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:32,070
<i> Yes, your love
is breaking my chill... </i>

1645
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:36,210
I have a huge boner right now.

1646
01:12:36,251 --> 01:12:38,412
<i> In my heart... </i>

1647
01:12:38,454 --> 01:12:39,887
Oh, my God!

1648
01:12:39,922 --> 01:12:42,254
Becky!

1649
01:12:42,291 --> 01:12:43,417
Where did you go?

1650
01:12:43,459 --> 01:12:45,586
What the fuck is going on here?

1651
01:12:45,627 --> 01:12:47,925
Uh, inter-species erotica.

1652
01:12:47,963 --> 01:12:49,692
Are you okay?

1653
01:12:49,732 --> 01:12:53,532
I'm disgusted and repulsed
and...

1654
01:12:53,569 --> 01:12:55,537
and I can't look away.

1655
01:12:55,571 --> 01:12:57,698
<i> Baby, don't let me
be misunderstood... </i>

1656
01:12:57,740 --> 01:12:59,731
It's huge!

1657
01:12:59,775 --> 01:13:00,867
<i> Temporary love's so bad... </i>

1658
01:13:00,909 --> 01:13:02,069
<i>-  But it feels so good </i>

1659
01:13:02,111 --> 01:13:04,045
<i> Then along came you... </i>

1660
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:05,410
We need to talk.

1661
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:07,540
Did you see the size
of that cock...

1662
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:08,481
I love you.

1663
01:13:10,052 --> 01:13:11,952
And-and I think
you love me, too.

1664
01:13:13,922 --> 01:13:16,720
Uh, of-of course.
I...

1665
01:13:16,759 --> 01:13:17,919
I mean, we're friends.

1666
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:20,190
L-I think you love me
as more than a friend.

1667
01:13:22,664 --> 01:13:24,291
It's okay.
You can say it.

1668
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:27,393
But l-I don't believe
in romantic love.

1669
01:13:27,436 --> 01:13:29,028
I think you do.

1670
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:32,267
Do you really want
to do this right now?

1671
01:13:32,307 --> 01:13:34,070
<i> But it feels so good </i>

1672
01:13:34,109 --> 01:13:36,236
<i>-  Then along came you... </i>

1673
01:13:36,278 --> 01:13:39,270
Well, I guess the show's over.

1674
01:13:39,314 --> 01:13:40,781
I don't think so, sir.

1675
01:13:40,816 --> 01:13:42,977
<i> Naughty girls
need love... too... </i>

1676
01:13:50,893 --> 01:13:52,861
If he's gonna jerk off,

1677
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:54,487
I'm gonna jerk off, too.

1678
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:56,725
I don't think
he's gonna jerk off.

1679
01:13:59,535 --> 01:14:01,503
<i> So moving like you're 40 </i>

1680
01:14:01,537 --> 01:14:03,903
<i> This groove
is much too naughty </i>

1681
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:05,031
<i> Can't you see? </i>

1682
01:14:05,073 --> 01:14:06,768
<i> I want you just for me </i>

1683
01:14:06,809 --> 01:14:08,436
<i>-  Boys, make some noise... </i>

1684
01:14:09,478 --> 01:14:10,877
Yo, you guys
are gonna miss this shit!

1685
01:14:10,913 --> 01:14:15,373
The big guy's gonna cornhole
that ass... with his wiener!

1686
01:14:15,417 --> 01:14:17,044
Hold that thought.

1687
01:14:17,085 --> 01:14:22,523
<i> Freeze, freeze,
freeze, freeze... </i>

1688
01:14:26,829 --> 01:14:30,526
I hope that donkey doesn't have
a heinie troll.

1689
01:14:30,566 --> 01:14:32,534
<i> Temporary love's so bad... </i>

1690
01:14:32,568 --> 01:14:34,331
All right, I do.

1691
01:14:34,369 --> 01:14:36,234
Do what?

1692
01:14:36,271 --> 01:14:39,172
<i> Then along came you... </i>

1693
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:40,732
I do love you.

1694
01:14:47,449 --> 01:14:50,350
<i> Temporary, temporary... </i>

1695
01:14:53,121 --> 01:14:55,612
What kind of sick
fuck gets turned on

1696
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:57,625
watching a guy fuck a donkey?

1697
01:14:57,659 --> 01:14:59,957
<i> Naughty girls need love </i>

1698
01:14:59,995 --> 01:15:02,691
<i> Baby, baby </i>

1699
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:06,634
I'm sorry, Jesus.

1700
01:15:08,971 --> 01:15:12,270
<i> Then along came you... </i>

1701
01:15:17,579 --> 01:15:18,568
Dante?

1702
01:15:29,291 --> 01:15:31,555
What's going on?

1703
01:15:31,593 --> 01:15:33,254
Ooh, cake.

1704
01:15:34,796 --> 01:15:37,560
Yo, I was outside taking a piss
when I heard the news.

1705
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:38,588
Congrats!

1706
01:15:40,802 --> 01:15:42,235
You're having a baby, right?

1707
01:15:44,506 --> 01:15:47,703
No. Who said that?

1708
01:15:50,078 --> 01:15:52,239
Some asshole.

1709
01:15:54,082 --> 01:15:57,313
<i> Temporary, temporary... </i>

1710
01:16:00,789 --> 01:16:02,916
I'm sorry.

<i> Naughty girls need love... </i>

1712
01:16:06,595 --> 01:16:08,028
You fuck!

1713
01:16:11,266 --> 01:16:12,790
Quick, hit that
two-timing fuck with this!

1714
01:16:16,605 --> 01:16:18,732
Hey, want to go out sometime?

1715
01:16:24,212 --> 01:16:26,339
Emma, I don't...
I don't know what to say.

1716
01:16:27,382 --> 01:16:29,782
Take him, you fucking whore.

1717
01:16:34,523 --> 01:16:35,512
Emma!

1718
01:16:39,528 --> 01:16:41,689
Oh, no.

1719
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:43,664
<i> Don't let me </i>

1720
01:16:43,699 --> 01:16:45,291
<i> Baby </i>

1721
01:16:45,334 --> 01:16:46,767
<i> Temporary love's so bad </i>

1722
01:16:46,802 --> 01:16:49,532
<i> Temporary love's
so bad </i>

1723
01:16:49,571 --> 01:16:50,595
<i> Then along came you... </i>

1724
01:16:50,639 --> 01:16:53,631
Oh, shit, not again.
Got to finish.

1725
01:16:54,676 --> 01:16:56,974
Yo, cops are outside,
we're holding,

1726
01:16:57,045 --> 01:16:59,775
and I'm still on probation.

1727
01:17:01,383 --> 01:17:05,046
<i>-  Temporary, temporary... </i>

1728
01:17:05,087 --> 01:17:07,078
What the fuck?

1729
01:17:11,159 --> 01:17:12,649
Porch monkey?!

1730
01:17:12,694 --> 01:17:14,218
Oh, no, no, it's cool.

1731
01:17:14,262 --> 01:17:15,524
I'm taking it back.

1732
01:17:16,932 --> 01:17:20,527
I love pussy and beer!

1733
01:17:20,569 --> 01:17:21,558
Whoo-hoo!

1734
01:17:32,814 --> 01:17:35,612
Deja fucking vu, right?

1735
01:17:46,128 --> 01:17:49,564
Jail cell design hasn't changed
much in centuries, has it?

1736
01:17:50,832 --> 01:17:52,823
Maybe it's time they brought in
the laser bars or something.

1737
01:17:52,868 --> 01:17:54,301
Or they can make

1738
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:57,965
<i>a hard plastic cage
like Magneto's in X- Men 2.</i>

1739
01:17:58,073 --> 01:17:59,370
No, come on, dude,

1740
01:17:59,408 --> 01:18:01,342
let's keep it in the real world,
all right?

1741
01:18:02,611 --> 01:18:04,010
But you know
what wouldn't be a bad idea?

1742
01:18:04,046 --> 01:18:05,240
Carbonite.

1743
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:09,678
What do you think, Dante?

1744
01:18:11,053 --> 01:18:12,042
I think I'm gonna kill you!

1745
01:18:12,087 --> 01:18:13,577
Get off of me!

1746
01:18:13,622 --> 01:18:15,590
What up?! Steel cage match!

1747
01:18:15,624 --> 01:18:16,750
You ruined my life!

1748
01:18:16,792 --> 01:18:18,259
Your life was already ruined!

1749
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:20,821
Jesus!

1750
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:22,056
What were you thinking?

1751
01:18:22,097 --> 01:18:23,359
A fucking donkey show?!

1752
01:18:23,398 --> 01:18:25,025
It was your going-away present!

1753
01:18:25,067 --> 01:18:26,056
DANTE:
It sure was.

1754
01:18:26,101 --> 01:18:27,568
I just never thought
I'd be going away to prison.

1755
01:18:27,602 --> 01:18:29,331
SEXY STUD:
Hey, boys.

1756
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:31,737
You can't be imprisoned

1757
01:18:31,773 --> 01:18:33,934
for watching
an inter-species sex act.

1758
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:35,703
You guys'll walk.

1759
01:18:35,744 --> 01:18:38,076
The most I'll get'll be a fine
for animal abuse

1760
01:18:38,113 --> 01:18:41,412
and a lot of disgusted looks
from asswipe conservatives

1761
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:43,918
who can't appreciate
sexual exploration.

1762
01:18:43,952 --> 01:18:45,146
Hey!

1763
01:18:49,157 --> 01:18:52,092
I miss my donkey.

1764
01:18:53,128 --> 01:18:54,686
I can't believe you.

1765
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:56,459
I finally get my shit together.

1766
01:18:56,498 --> 01:18:57,965
I'm hours
from getting out of here

1767
01:18:57,999 --> 01:19:00,797
and really starting my life,
and you somehow figure out a way

1768
01:19:00,836 --> 01:19:03,327
to obliterate all that
and reduce me to a convict.

1769
01:19:03,371 --> 01:19:05,805
Oh, yeah, it's my fault
your life's fucked up.

1770
01:19:05,841 --> 01:19:08,139
I'm the engaged guy
who knocked up my boss.

1771
01:19:09,177 --> 01:19:12,476
You knocked up the guy
who owns Mooby's? Ew.

1772
01:19:12,514 --> 01:19:13,606
<i>What?</i>

1773
01:19:13,648 --> 01:19:14,444
Would you shut up?

1774
01:19:16,718 --> 01:19:18,276
You're chaos incarnate, man.

1775
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:19,480
Our whole lives,

1776
01:19:19,521 --> 01:19:22,012
you've been getting me into
trouble and holding me back.

1777
01:19:22,057 --> 01:19:23,490
Oh, I'm holding you back, right?

1778
01:19:23,525 --> 01:19:25,049
I remember, like, ten years ago,

1779
01:19:25,093 --> 01:19:26,924
the night we went
to Julie Dwyer's funeral,

1780
01:19:27,028 --> 01:19:29,553
you were all like, "I need
to shit or get off the pot."

1781
01:19:29,598 --> 01:19:31,725
You said, "Shit
or get off the pot," not me.

1782
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:34,327
You got all fired up about
taking charge of your life,

1783
01:19:34,369 --> 01:19:35,495
and what'd you do?

1784
01:19:35,537 --> 01:19:37,937
You worked at the store
till the place burned down.

1785
01:19:38,039 --> 01:19:39,438
I took courses at Brookdale.

1786
01:19:39,474 --> 01:19:40,406
And dropped out.

1787
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:41,875
Because you stopped going.

1788
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:44,708
Because we were just killing
time with those classes.

1789
01:19:44,746 --> 01:19:45,940
One semester,

1790
01:19:46,014 --> 01:19:47,675
we took Criminology,
for Christ's sake.

1791
01:19:47,716 --> 01:19:49,911
What the fuck were we training
to be, Batman?

1792
01:19:49,951 --> 01:19:52,249
DANTE:
At least we were
doing something

1793
01:19:52,287 --> 01:19:54,949
instead of wasting our lives in
some fucking convenience store!

1794
01:19:55,056 --> 01:19:56,353
RANDAL:
You know what?

1795
01:19:56,391 --> 01:19:59,360
You can badmouth Quick Stop all
you want, but I miss that place.

1796
01:19:59,394 --> 01:20:00,520
I loved working there.

1797
01:20:00,562 --> 01:20:03,030
I look back on that period
as the best time in my life.

1798
01:20:04,065 --> 01:20:05,532
Now I know you're fuckin' nuts.

1799
01:20:05,567 --> 01:20:08,695
Why? Because I enjoyed
what I did?

1800
01:20:08,737 --> 01:20:10,261
I got to watch movies,

1801
01:20:10,305 --> 01:20:12,705
fuck with assholes,
and hang out with my best friend

1802
01:20:12,741 --> 01:20:13,867
all day.

1803
01:20:13,909 --> 01:20:15,206
Can you think of a better way
to make a living?

1804
01:20:15,243 --> 01:20:17,211
Yeah, maybe it's not
what everyone does,

1805
01:20:17,245 --> 01:20:18,906
but it was pretty fucking good.

1806
01:20:19,948 --> 01:20:21,540
Man, that's you all over.

1807
01:20:21,583 --> 01:20:23,175
Scrape by with the bare minimum.

1808
01:20:23,218 --> 01:20:25,618
Well, I'm tired of that, Randal.

1809
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:27,212
I'm not in high school anymore.

1810
01:20:27,255 --> 01:20:29,553
Shit, I'm not
even in my twenties anymore.

1811
01:20:29,591 --> 01:20:31,388
I don't want to sit around
and rag on customers

1812
01:20:31,426 --> 01:20:32,552
while eating free food.

1813
01:20:32,594 --> 01:20:33,754
That's what you want to do.

1814
01:20:33,795 --> 01:20:35,695
That's what you've
always wanted to do.

1815
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:37,891
Well, if that's all you want out
of life, man, then God bless,

1816
01:20:37,933 --> 01:20:40,766
but I refuse to let your shit
taint the rest of mine.

1817
01:20:40,802 --> 01:20:43,896
No. I'm gonna smooth
things over with Emma,

1818
01:20:43,939 --> 01:20:45,304
go to Florida

1819
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:48,400
and start
my Randal Graves-free existence.

1820
01:20:50,245 --> 01:20:54,579
And try to forget these last
33 years ever happened.

1821
01:21:00,555 --> 01:21:03,854
So that's the way you see all
this time we've spent together?

1822
01:21:06,194 --> 01:21:07,957
That's weird, man.

1823
01:21:08,063 --> 01:21:09,963
I thought you were
the only guy in the world

1824
01:21:10,065 --> 01:21:11,930
who got me and had my back...

1825
01:21:11,967 --> 01:21:14,959
the only person
who'd take a bullet for me,

1826
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:16,537
'cause I assumed
you felt about me

1827
01:21:16,571 --> 01:21:19,404
the same way I feel about you.

1828
01:21:19,441 --> 01:21:21,909
Then, all of a sudden, one day,
you're like, "I'm moving. Bye."

1829
01:21:21,943 --> 01:21:25,071
Do you know
what that's been like for me?

1830
01:21:26,314 --> 01:21:27,975
I'm looking at a future
that just sucks,

1831
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:29,983
because you're
not gonna be in it anymore.

1832
01:21:30,085 --> 01:21:31,552
And you're not
even throwing me over

1833
01:21:31,586 --> 01:21:33,383
for a life
that means something to you.

1834
01:21:33,421 --> 01:21:35,389
It's just a stupid,
hollow existence

1835
01:21:35,423 --> 01:21:36,390
you think you should embrace

1836
01:21:36,424 --> 01:21:37,789
because you're getting old
or something,

1837
01:21:37,826 --> 01:21:42,889
because it's the kind of life
everyone else goes after.

1838
01:21:42,931 --> 01:21:45,559
You're a fucking drone, dude.

1839
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:46,567
DANTE:
Fine.

1840
01:21:46,601 --> 01:21:48,228
Then the next friend
whose life you ruin

1841
01:21:48,270 --> 01:21:50,170
can be a totally free spirit.

1842
01:21:50,205 --> 01:21:51,297
How's that?

1843
01:21:51,339 --> 01:21:55,002
You think I want to start
making friends at my age?

1844
01:21:55,043 --> 01:21:57,011
Christ.

1845
01:21:57,045 --> 01:21:59,036
Who would want me
as their friend?

1846
01:22:00,215 --> 01:22:03,707
I hate everyone, and everything
seems stupid to me...

1847
01:22:06,421 --> 01:22:09,356
...but you were always
the counterbalance to that...

1848
01:22:09,391 --> 01:22:13,691
the guy who was the yin
to my yang.

1849
01:22:13,728 --> 01:22:17,220
But now what the fuck am I gonna
do for the rest of my life?

1850
01:22:19,734 --> 01:22:21,497
I mean, shit, I really wish

1851
01:22:21,536 --> 01:22:22,969
you would've told me this
when I first met you

1852
01:22:23,038 --> 01:22:24,335
that one day,
you were gonna bail

1853
01:22:24,372 --> 01:22:25,669
on our friendship,

1854
01:22:25,707 --> 01:22:27,675
because if I had known
you were just gonna flake on me

1855
01:22:27,709 --> 01:22:31,338
a few decades later...

1856
01:22:31,379 --> 01:22:32,971
I wouldn't have even bothered
with your ass

1857
01:22:33,048 --> 01:22:35,278
in the first place.

1858
01:22:38,019 --> 01:22:39,179
Jesus, why don't you two

1859
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:41,381
just fuck and get it
over with already?

1860
01:22:43,325 --> 01:22:44,451
<i>Faggots.</i>

1861
01:22:44,492 --> 01:22:48,326
Why can't you ever say
something useful for a change?

1862
01:22:49,364 --> 01:22:50,626
Well, what the fuck
you waiting for?

1863
01:22:50,665 --> 01:22:52,997
That's your cue, man.

1864
01:23:03,678 --> 01:23:05,339
I got nothing.

1865
01:23:07,215 --> 01:23:08,477
Jesus fucking Christ,
what good are you,

1866
01:23:08,516 --> 01:23:09,642
you mute fuck?!

1867
01:23:09,684 --> 01:23:11,174
You know what?
That hurts.

1868
01:23:11,219 --> 01:23:13,744
Like, what do you ever add
to the fucking proceedings?

1869
01:23:13,788 --> 01:23:16,586
You got, like, one answer
for everything: "Pussy, man."

1870
01:23:16,624 --> 01:23:19,149
Oh, then, man, you must love
this fuckin' guy,

1871
01:23:19,194 --> 01:23:21,128
'cause he's the biggest pussy
I ever met.

1872
01:23:21,162 --> 01:23:22,652
The dude who lives his life

1873
01:23:22,697 --> 01:23:23,925
according
to everyone else's standards.

1874
01:23:23,965 --> 01:23:25,762
"I got to go to Florida

1875
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:28,166
and get married, 'cause that's
what's expected of me."

1876
01:23:28,203 --> 01:23:30,831
And the fuckin' insane part is,
he ain't even that crazy

1877
01:23:30,872 --> 01:23:33,136
about the chick he's marrying
or Florida,

1878
01:23:33,174 --> 01:23:34,334
never mind the fact
that he's got

1879
01:23:34,376 --> 01:23:35,343
a perfectly good chick

1880
01:23:35,377 --> 01:23:37,971
right here in Jersey
who he's nuts about,

1881
01:23:38,046 --> 01:23:41,174
and even Anne fuckin' Frank
could see she's nuts about him.

1882
01:23:41,216 --> 01:23:42,843
God knows why.

1883
01:23:42,884 --> 01:23:44,977
And she likes you
for who you are, man.

1884
01:23:45,053 --> 01:23:46,850
She ain't trying
to stuff you into a box

1885
01:23:46,888 --> 01:23:48,355
you'll never fit into.

1886
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:49,948
Not to mention the fact
that she's carrying

1887
01:23:49,991 --> 01:23:51,652
your hideous fucking CHUD
of a kid.

1888
01:23:52,961 --> 01:23:54,451
Jesus, if you had any sense
whatsoever,

1889
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:55,793
you'd fuckin' stop trying

1890
01:23:55,830 --> 01:23:57,457
to bray it up
with the rest of the sheep

1891
01:23:57,499 --> 01:24:00,297
and live your life
the way it makes sense for you,

1892
01:24:00,335 --> 01:24:01,700
you fuckin' ass!

1893
01:24:01,736 --> 01:24:03,704
Oh, yeah?
And what's that?

1894
01:24:03,738 --> 01:24:04,932
You obviously have
such a great handle

1895
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,302
on your life.

1896
01:24:06,341 --> 01:24:07,933
Tell me what you would do
if you were in my position...

1897
01:24:08,009 --> 01:24:10,273
or even what you'd do
in your own position?

1898
01:24:10,311 --> 01:24:12,802
Swing that judgmental pendulum
back the other way

1899
01:24:12,847 --> 01:24:14,610
and tell me how you'd solve
all your problems, asshole.

1900
01:24:14,649 --> 01:24:16,708
What the fuck would the
great Randal Graves do

1901
01:24:16,751 --> 01:24:18,150
if he were half the
master of his destiny

1902
01:24:18,186 --> 01:24:19,619
that I'm supposed to be?!

1903
01:24:19,654 --> 01:24:23,818
I'd buy the Quick Stop
and reopen it myself!

1904
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:27,627
That's what I'd do.

1905
01:24:27,662 --> 01:24:30,256
That's what we should do.

1906
01:24:31,299 --> 01:24:32,766
Yeah, right.

1907
01:24:32,801 --> 01:24:35,463
Who-who are we, Lance Dowds?

1908
01:24:35,503 --> 01:24:37,266
Do you know
how much it would cost

1909
01:24:37,305 --> 01:24:38,272
to buy the Quick Stop?

1910
01:24:38,306 --> 01:24:39,967
Like, 50 grand, easy.

1911
01:24:40,041 --> 01:24:43,533
And neither one of us have
that type of money.

1912
01:24:50,618 --> 01:24:53,109
JAY:
We do.

1913
01:24:57,492 --> 01:24:59,722
That's right.

1914
01:25:00,962 --> 01:25:03,430
You guys would be willing
to lend us some of that money

1915
01:25:03,465 --> 01:25:04,989
so we can reopen the stores?

1916
01:25:08,303 --> 01:25:10,931
Sure, on two conditions.

1917
01:25:10,972 --> 01:25:13,099
One: We can hang out
in front of the store

1918
01:25:13,141 --> 01:25:14,904
anytime we want, and
you can't call the cops.

1919
01:25:16,144 --> 01:25:17,941
And two:

1920
01:25:18,012 --> 01:25:19,775
You have to blow each other,

1921
01:25:19,814 --> 01:25:20,803
and we get to watch.

1922
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:24,308
Then you have
to go ass to mouth.

1923
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:30,656
All right, just
the first condition.

1924
01:25:31,693 --> 01:25:32,921
Seriously?

1925
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:33,928
Do I stutter?

1926
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:35,930
Yeah, seriously.

1927
01:25:40,568 --> 01:25:42,331
What do you think?

1928
01:25:43,872 --> 01:25:46,841
I almost hate to say it, but...

1929
01:25:46,875 --> 01:25:48,843
it kind of makes sense.

1930
01:25:50,011 --> 01:25:52,980
Hey, maybe that's why we spent
so much time in that store,

1931
01:25:53,014 --> 01:25:54,481
why college

1932
01:25:54,516 --> 01:25:56,984
or anything else
never panned out for us.

1933
01:25:57,051 --> 01:25:58,575
I mean, think about it, man.

1934
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:00,110
You and me running
our own business

1935
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:02,817
instead of working
for some other asshole?

1936
01:26:03,892 --> 01:26:06,417
Could be
pretty fuckin' sweet, right?

1937
01:26:08,329 --> 01:26:10,820
Yeah, it really could.

1938
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:17,695
But I don't know, man.

1939
01:26:17,739 --> 01:26:21,004
I was this close
to starting a new life.

1940
01:26:22,043 --> 01:26:23,305
Jesus.

1941
01:26:25,046 --> 01:26:27,708
You're actually gonna make me
do this, aren't you?

1942
01:26:31,619 --> 01:26:34,918
Can you guys cover your ears
for a minute, please?

1943
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:48,062
You're my best friend...

1944
01:26:48,102 --> 01:26:49,967
and I love you.

1945
01:26:51,739 --> 01:26:54,867
In a totally heterosexual way.

1946
01:26:54,909 --> 01:26:57,241
Yeah, right.

1947
01:26:59,113 --> 01:27:02,708
Please, man, don't leave me.

1948
01:27:07,522 --> 01:27:09,353
Thanks.

1949
01:27:15,697 --> 01:27:17,528
