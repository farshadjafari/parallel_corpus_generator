1
00:00:44,457 --> 00:00:48,496
- Ally, can we get a recap?
- Remember the Kowolskis?

2
00:00:48,577 --> 00:00:52,729
They want to set a record by
making Buffalo's largest cookie.

3
00:00:52,817 --> 00:00:54,694
- You have to wear this.
- A hairnet?

4
00:00:54,777 --> 00:00:58,690
Health Department. If you're around
the cookie, you have to have it on.

5
00:00:58,777 --> 00:01:00,096
I just did the hair.

6
00:01:00,177 --> 00:01:01,496
The hairis perfect.

7
00:01:01,577 --> 00:01:03,693
All right, give it to me.

8
00:01:05,697 --> 00:01:09,053
God... why do you hate me?

9
00:01:09,137 --> 00:01:11,776
We're rolling. And speed.

10
00:01:11,857 --> 00:01:14,530
For three decades,
the Kowolski Bakery

11
00:01:14,617 --> 00:01:17,415
has been a mainstay
in downtown Buffalo,

12
00:01:17,497 --> 00:01:21,046
known for their sinfully sweet,
cream-filled Polski pierogies

13
00:01:21,137 --> 00:01:24,925
and the occasional
sugar-induced coma that follows.

14
00:01:25,017 --> 00:01:27,736
Today, in honour of their 30th anniversary,

15
00:01:27,817 --> 00:01:31,571
they've invited us to ride along
as they go for the record

16
00:01:32,257 --> 00:01:34,487
on Buffalo's biggest cookie.

17
00:01:37,057 --> 00:01:40,811
Vol. Do you need
a tissue or something?

18
00:01:40,897 --> 00:01:43,457
Can we get Vol a tissue? Or a spoon?

19
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:45,334
Good thing we're wearing these.

20
00:01:45,417 --> 00:01:48,648
I wouldn't want any stray hairs
to fall into the booger.

21
00:01:48,737 --> 00:01:51,410
- We doing this again?
- No. We can cut to B roll.

22
00:01:51,497 --> 00:01:52,725
Moving on!

23
00:01:52,817 --> 00:01:57,015
Tell me, Mama,
why make Buffalo's biggest cookie?

24
00:01:57,497 --> 00:02:04,175
Well, man from Health Department
say he find rat pellet in our pastry.

25
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:08,489
But I say no, is big chocolate sprinkle.

26
00:02:08,577 --> 00:02:11,216
But he shut store down.

27
00:02:11,377 --> 00:02:13,732
So we clean up,

28
00:02:13,817 --> 00:02:17,890
make big cookie
for to bring customers back.

29
00:02:19,177 --> 00:02:21,133
Well, I admire your candour.

30
00:02:21,217 --> 00:02:23,014
Let's try that again, shall we?

31
00:02:23,097 --> 00:02:26,976
Tell me, Mama,
why make Buffalo's biggest cookie?

32
00:02:27,737 --> 00:02:32,015
So the children of the neighbourhood
will be happy.

33
00:02:32,097 --> 00:02:35,646
It must be wonderful seeing
the smiles on their little faces.

34
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:39,246
I work in back. I see no smiles.

35
00:02:42,337 --> 00:02:46,455
The previous record was 8 feet
7 inches, baked by Gladys Pelsnick.

36
00:02:46,537 --> 00:02:49,415
If this cookie beats that, it will prove

37
00:02:49,497 --> 00:02:51,647
the Kowolskis
have much more free time.

38
00:02:51,737 --> 00:02:55,366
And the cookie is... 10 feet, 4 inches!

39
00:02:55,457 --> 00:02:58,017
We have a new record!

40
00:02:58,617 --> 00:03:01,290
Cue the cheesy inspirational music!

41
00:03:18,337 --> 00:03:20,646
But what are we really looking at here?

42
00:03:20,737 --> 00:03:22,534
Is it just a big cookie?

43
00:03:22,617 --> 00:03:25,654
Or does this cookie represent
the pride of Buffalo?

44
00:03:25,737 --> 00:03:28,968
Its hard-working citizens
the key ingredient -

45
00:03:29,057 --> 00:03:31,048
with a few nuts thrown in.

46
00:03:31,937 --> 00:03:34,053
And finally,
the love of our families,

47
00:03:34,137 --> 00:03:36,776
which provides the warm centre,

48
00:03:36,857 --> 00:03:41,135
making our beloved Buffalo
the sweetest place to live.

49
00:03:41,217 --> 00:03:43,970
And that's the way
the cookie crumbles.

50
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,969
I'm Bruce Nolan, Eyewitness News.

51
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:49,928
And cut.

52
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,574
So what do you think?

53
00:03:52,657 --> 00:03:54,056
It's really good.

54
00:03:54,137 --> 00:03:56,697
It sucks. It's a story about a cookie.

55
00:03:56,777 --> 00:03:59,974
The Pillsbury Doughboy
would be riveted.

56
00:04:00,057 --> 00:04:04,289
It made me laugh. Nothing wrong
with making people laugh.

57
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:07,926
I'll never be an anchorman.
The job's there, but I can't reach it.

58
00:04:08,017 --> 00:04:12,807
Every time they make me do
this kind of stuff I have to act like a goof.

59
00:04:12,897 --> 00:04:16,207
I have no credibility. Not good.

60
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:18,572
- Now you just sound silly.
- Forget it.

61
00:04:18,657 --> 00:04:22,172
It's not important.
Let's watch it one more time.

62
00:04:22,297 --> 00:04:24,208
- No.
- Once more? Please?

63
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:27,687
No! You promised to help me
with this photo album.

64
00:04:28,777 --> 00:04:30,893
Now get your gooy butt over here.

65
00:04:35,337 --> 00:04:37,328
Looking.

66
00:04:37,937 --> 00:04:38,926
OK.

67
00:04:39,017 --> 00:04:42,976
Just go through this stack
and pick your favourites.

68
00:04:47,657 --> 00:04:49,454
Come on. This is fun, right?

69
00:04:49,537 --> 00:04:51,528
Isn't this fun? This is nice.

70
00:04:52,497 --> 00:04:54,408
Evan's going to get that anchor job.

71
00:04:54,497 --> 00:04:56,089
- Bruce!
- He's the favourite.

72
00:04:56,177 --> 00:04:59,806
You know what? Just forget it.
This is just our life.

73
00:04:59,897 --> 00:05:02,855
We can always just
have some kid do it for us.

74
00:05:03,617 --> 00:05:05,369
Hold the phone.

75
00:05:05,457 --> 00:05:07,925
I like this one.
Our weekend at the lake.

76
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:10,929
That's supposed to be in our private stash.

77
00:05:11,017 --> 00:05:14,248
- You look perky. Must have been cold.
- Give it to me.

78
00:05:14,337 --> 00:05:16,692
I think I'll put this on my computer.

79
00:05:16,777 --> 00:05:18,733
- Give it to me. Come on.
- No!

80
00:05:18,817 --> 00:05:20,887
Fine. Do with it what you will.

81
00:05:20,977 --> 00:05:22,649
I don't care.

82
00:05:22,737 --> 00:05:25,126
- I will do with it what I will.
- Jesus.

83
00:05:27,177 --> 00:05:29,407
I might even send this in to Playboy.

84
00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:33,251
- Their layouts can be quite tasteful.
- Give that to me right now!

85
00:05:34,217 --> 00:05:36,208
- Rough stuff.
- I'm going to hurt you.

86
00:05:41,737 --> 00:05:43,853
Sweetie? Time to get up.

87
00:05:46,297 --> 00:05:48,288
Good dream. No.

88
00:05:57,617 --> 00:06:02,088
The Buffalo Sabres lost again last
night to the Toronto Maple Leafs.

89
00:06:02,177 --> 00:06:04,532
Of course they did. They're my team.

90
00:06:04,857 --> 00:06:06,848
That's the way the cookie crumbles.

91
00:06:06,937 --> 00:06:09,815
There might be something
to this cookie line.

92
00:06:09,897 --> 00:06:15,290
The greatest anchors have a signature
sign-off. Like Walter Cronkite.

93
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:19,372
And that's the way it was.

94
00:06:19,457 --> 00:06:22,654
That's the way the cookie crumbles.

95
00:06:22,737 --> 00:06:27,094
That's the way I like it

96
00:06:28,217 --> 00:06:29,570
Oh, no.

97
00:06:29,657 --> 00:06:32,171
- Grace, the dog!
- I'm in the shower!

98
00:06:36,937 --> 00:06:38,609
No, Sam. Bad dog.

99
00:06:38,697 --> 00:06:40,927
Inside, bad. Outside, good.

100
00:06:47,737 --> 00:06:49,728
You're done now. Great.

101
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:53,450
B- E-A-utiful.

102
00:06:55,177 --> 00:06:57,816
Come on.
Let's go back in and have a shit.

103
00:07:03,057 --> 00:07:06,015
- What is the dillio?
- We are having a blood drive.

104
00:07:06,977 --> 00:07:09,332
- Needles. Yuck.
- They need my blood.

105
00:07:09,417 --> 00:07:12,693
I have a very rare blood type.
I'm AB positive.

106
00:07:12,777 --> 00:07:14,847
Really? I'm IB positive.

107
00:07:14,937 --> 00:07:18,850
I B positive they ain't touching me
with no needle. It's just so...

108
00:07:18,937 --> 00:07:21,656
- Helpful and life-saving?
- No. It's blood.

109
00:07:21,737 --> 00:07:25,207
Blood is supposed to stay
inside the body, where it's meant to be.

110
00:07:25,297 --> 00:07:29,131
Besides, they stockpile this stuff
in a warehouse, it's all on ice,

111
00:07:29,217 --> 00:07:30,969
and they say there's a shortage.

112
00:07:31,057 --> 00:07:32,968
Where did you hear that?

113
00:07:33,057 --> 00:07:34,934
From a friend of a friend

114
00:07:35,017 --> 00:07:38,487
of a girl whose sister is going out with
someone in the government.

115
00:07:38,577 --> 00:07:40,852
For your protection,
I cannot discuss it.

116
00:07:40,937 --> 00:07:43,246
Now get out,
before they see us together.

117
00:07:47,097 --> 00:07:49,850
Here. You need these more than I do.

118
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:51,336
What is "these"?

119
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:53,567
Prayer beads.
The kids made them for me.

120
00:07:53,657 --> 00:07:57,445
- They will keep you safe.
- I hope they're powerful.

121
00:07:57,537 --> 00:08:00,927
I'm going to need a friggin' miracle
to get to work on time.

122
00:08:11,097 --> 00:08:14,692
This isn't happening.
Not now. Not during sweeps week.

123
00:08:18,777 --> 00:08:20,574
Oh, God.

124
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,851
Yup, meeting started without me.

125
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:26,451
This is my luck.

126
00:08:33,057 --> 00:08:35,048
Come on.

127
00:08:38,577 --> 00:08:40,568
Jesus.

128
00:08:40,697 --> 00:08:42,688
Get out of there!

129
00:08:46,657 --> 00:08:49,615
"Are you blind?" No, but I'm late.

130
00:08:51,737 --> 00:08:54,535
Is yourchild in direjeopardy?

131
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,608
Find out tonight after the game.

132
00:08:56,697 --> 00:08:58,369
Promos are approved.

133
00:08:58,457 --> 00:09:01,529
Jack? Shouldn't we be focusing
on Pete's retirement?

134
00:09:01,617 --> 00:09:04,973
- This is his last week.
- Any word on the anchor position?

135
00:09:05,057 --> 00:09:07,935
Evan, when I know something,
you'll know something.

136
00:09:08,737 --> 00:09:10,329
Sorry I'm late.

137
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:12,692
Traffic was...

138
00:09:12,777 --> 00:09:14,529
Did you already play the spots?

139
00:09:14,617 --> 00:09:17,256
Nice story,
but we're going with Evan's piece.

140
00:09:17,337 --> 00:09:20,568
The sex scandal
in the mayor's office for sweeps.

141
00:09:22,017 --> 00:09:24,611
Yeah. Sweeps.

142
00:09:25,217 --> 00:09:27,447
And that's the way
the cookie crumbles.

143
00:09:29,137 --> 00:09:31,128
I'm just messing with you, Bruce.

144
00:09:31,217 --> 00:09:37,213
See, you just gotta remember that
the newsroom is like a big cookie.

145
00:09:38,937 --> 00:09:42,612
Do you like jazz, Evan?
Let me play something for you.

146
00:09:49,417 --> 00:09:52,090
- I can hold that note all day.
- Knock it off, guys.

147
00:09:52,617 --> 00:09:54,733
We'll keep your story in reserve.

148
00:09:54,817 --> 00:09:58,810
Can we get back to the board so we'll
have something to put on the air today?

149
00:09:58,897 --> 00:10:02,606
Great choice, Jack.
The Cadillac of bolognas.

150
00:10:02,697 --> 00:10:04,494
Jack, can I talk to you?

151
00:10:04,577 --> 00:10:07,137
- Sure. What do you need?
- Sweeps.

152
00:10:07,217 --> 00:10:10,926
Jack, hear me out.
I'm starting to get desperate.

153
00:10:11,057 --> 00:10:13,252
I'm pushing 40
and what have I got to show?

154
00:10:13,337 --> 00:10:17,649
I've hit a kind of ceiling. There's an
anti-Bruce barrier I can't get past.

155
00:10:17,737 --> 00:10:20,934
And Evan is loving it.

156
00:10:21,017 --> 00:10:24,805
He gets the stories, he gets on sweeps...
I should be more like Evan.

157
00:10:24,897 --> 00:10:27,013
Don't be like Evan. Evan's an asshole.

158
00:10:27,097 --> 00:10:29,816
- I can be an asshole.
- No, Bruce. You can't.

159
00:10:34,537 --> 00:10:37,176
- You going to pick that up?
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

160
00:10:37,257 --> 00:10:40,886
This anchor thing opening up
has got me nuts.

161
00:10:40,977 --> 00:10:42,968
- Hi, Susan.
- Hi, Jack.

162
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:48,328
You're a good reporter.
You make people laugh.

163
00:10:50,097 --> 00:10:51,689
All right. I'll tell you what.

164
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:54,928
Today is the 156th anniversary
of the Maid Of The Mist.

165
00:10:55,017 --> 00:10:59,249
- I want you in Niagara Falls in an hour.
- The Maid Of The Mist is always live.

166
00:11:00,777 --> 00:11:04,975
- Evan always does the live feeds.
- Now you and Evan get the live feeds.

167
00:11:05,057 --> 00:11:07,207
I'm going live? During sweeps?

168
00:11:07,297 --> 00:11:09,606
Watch your step.
I've seen your outtakes.

169
00:11:09,697 --> 00:11:11,574
Jack, you will not regret this.

170
00:11:12,537 --> 00:11:15,097
And I won't forget you
when I go national.

171
00:11:15,177 --> 00:11:16,769
Can you...?

172
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,768
Thanks, pal.

173
00:11:19,857 --> 00:11:23,532
Can I have your wish now?
I'll put it in the wish jar.

174
00:11:23,617 --> 00:11:24,970
Put your wish in.

175
00:11:25,057 --> 00:11:27,048
- Me, too.
- Put your wish in.

176
00:11:27,537 --> 00:11:29,414
That looks like a big wish.

177
00:11:29,497 --> 00:11:32,375
No, Martin, don't eat that.

178
00:11:32,457 --> 00:11:35,369
Don't put that in your mouth.
That's paste, honey.

179
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:40,534
- That must have tasted awful.
- Mommy!

180
00:11:42,737 --> 00:11:45,729
Did you have a good time
with Aunt Gracie today?

181
00:11:45,817 --> 00:11:50,095
- See how nice this is? Baby on the hip.
- It's amazing. You've become Mom.

182
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:52,407
The transformation is complete.

183
00:11:53,617 --> 00:11:54,766
I'll get it.

184
00:11:54,857 --> 00:11:56,654
- Small Wonders Day Care.
- Grace?

185
00:11:56,737 --> 00:11:59,729
It's Debbie, the sister
whose life you're notwasting.

186
00:11:59,817 --> 00:12:01,933
- OK.
- Bye, Debbie!

187
00:12:02,017 --> 00:12:04,008
Hi. Sorry.

188
00:12:04,097 --> 00:12:06,975
Debbie forgot to take her meds today.
Where are you?

189
00:12:07,057 --> 00:12:09,491
A little place
called the winner's circle.

190
00:12:09,577 --> 00:12:11,693
I'm at the falls, doing a live report.

191
00:12:11,777 --> 00:12:13,688
Live? That's great!

192
00:12:13,777 --> 00:12:16,735
Yeah! It's happening, hon.
I got sweeps and I'm live.

193
00:12:16,817 --> 00:12:19,012
They're seeing if I can think on my feet.

194
00:12:19,097 --> 00:12:21,850
Like I might have to do
in a live anchor situation.

195
00:12:21,937 --> 00:12:23,529
Oh, my gosh.

196
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:27,292
Yeah! Jack practically came out
and told me.

197
00:12:27,377 --> 00:12:28,605
Practically?

198
00:12:28,697 --> 00:12:31,495
He didn't spell it out. Legally, he can't.

199
00:12:31,577 --> 00:12:35,889
This is what happened to Susan Ortega
before they bumped her up to the desk.

200
00:12:35,977 --> 00:12:38,093
It's good.

201
00:12:38,177 --> 00:12:42,170
Well, honey, I just don't want you
to get too ahead of yourself.

202
00:12:42,257 --> 00:12:43,849
- Bruce.
- I got to go!

203
00:12:43,937 --> 00:12:47,054
- They're calling me in.
- OK, honey. Good luck. I love you.

204
00:12:49,257 --> 00:12:50,770
Let's do it.

205
00:12:51,017 --> 00:12:54,726
- They want you close to the falls.
- I'm going to get soaked.

206
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:57,285
That's the point.
They want you to put this on.

207
00:12:57,377 --> 00:13:00,335
Part of the condition
of us getting the exclusive.

208
00:13:00,417 --> 00:13:04,330
You know what?
Nothing can bother me today. Nothing.

209
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:07,932
Now remember,
it's their 156th-year anniversary.

210
00:13:08,017 --> 00:13:11,896
149 capacity. They cater
to tourists, honeymooners...

211
00:13:11,977 --> 00:13:14,730
And people who are insanely thirsty.
I get it.

212
00:13:14,817 --> 00:13:17,331
You're going to interview
Irene Dansfield.

213
00:13:17,417 --> 00:13:21,410
Irene, a pleasure to meet you.
You look beautiful.

214
00:13:21,497 --> 00:13:23,772
Irene's mother rode on the maiden voyage.

215
00:13:23,857 --> 00:13:25,688
- Rub that in my face!
- 90 seconds!

216
00:13:25,777 --> 00:13:27,210
Holy hell.

217
00:13:29,457 --> 00:13:31,413
Because of the fast response,

218
00:13:31,497 --> 00:13:35,376
the chemicals were cleaned up
without incident. Susan?

219
00:13:35,457 --> 00:13:37,607
Bruce Nolan is at Niagara Falls.

220
00:13:37,697 --> 00:13:40,894
But before we go live to Bruce,
we have an announcement.

221
00:13:40,977 --> 00:13:43,411
As everyone knows, after 33 years,

222
00:13:43,497 --> 00:13:46,728
our beloved Pete Fineman is retiring.

223
00:13:46,817 --> 00:13:51,288
Pete's shoes are virtually impossible
to fill, but the show must go on.

224
00:13:51,377 --> 00:13:56,656
And we could think ofno one better
than our very own Evan Baxter.

225
00:13:59,017 --> 00:14:00,052
Oh, boy!

226
00:14:00,457 --> 00:14:03,051
- Congratulations.
- I'm thrilled and honoured.

227
00:14:03,137 --> 00:14:07,528
As you said, no one can replace
Pete, but I will do my best.

228
00:14:07,617 --> 00:14:12,088
I am so proud to be a part
of our local community of Buffalo.

229
00:14:12,177 --> 00:14:17,092
I think, in a lot of ways, a great
city is like a great recipe, really.

230
00:14:17,177 --> 00:14:20,567
You take hard-working citizens,
add some care-givers,

231
00:14:20,657 --> 00:14:22,409
maybe a few nuts!

232
00:14:25,577 --> 00:14:29,172
All sprinkled with the love
and support of our good families.

233
00:14:29,257 --> 00:14:33,170
Ultimately, that makes
one sweet place to live.

234
00:14:33,577 --> 00:14:36,649
- That was amazing.
- I wish I'd written something.

235
00:14:36,737 --> 00:14:40,252
And now let's go live to that wacky
Bruce Nolan at Niagara Falls.

236
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,009
Hey, wacky Bruce!

237
00:14:46,217 --> 00:14:49,368
- Talk, Bruce. Hello.
- Talk, honey.

238
00:14:49,457 --> 00:14:51,254
- What's going on?
- A Walt Disney.

239
00:14:51,337 --> 00:14:53,692
- It's frozen solid.
- Check the feed.

240
00:14:53,777 --> 00:14:55,893
We may be having technical difficulty.

241
00:14:55,977 --> 00:14:57,854
- The feed's good, Jack.
- Come on.

242
00:14:57,937 --> 00:15:01,566
- Talk, Bruce, damn it.
- Get ready to pull the plug.

243
00:15:01,657 --> 00:15:04,046
Come on, baby. Say something!

244
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:06,135
Bruce, talk.

245
00:15:09,017 --> 00:15:10,655
- Hi, Susan.
- Thank you, God.

246
00:15:10,737 --> 00:15:12,056
Bruce Nolan here,

247
00:15:12,137 --> 00:15:15,573
aboard the Maid Of The Mist
in fabulous Niagara Falls, New York.

248
00:15:16,217 --> 00:15:20,210
First, let me just add another
congratulations to Evan Backstabber.

249
00:15:20,297 --> 00:15:22,447
Pardon me, Bastard... Baxter.

250
00:15:22,537 --> 00:15:25,335
It is good to see what
someone with real talent can do

251
00:15:25,417 --> 00:15:28,568
when great opportunities
are given to them instead of me.

252
00:15:29,977 --> 00:15:32,889
Anyway, I'm here
with Katharine Hepburn's mom.

253
00:15:32,977 --> 00:15:37,528
Why did you throw the Heart of the Ocean
jewel over the railing of the Titanic?

254
00:15:38,177 --> 00:15:40,532
Did you feel bad
letting Leo DiCaprio drown

255
00:15:40,617 --> 00:15:42,926
while you were safe
floating on the door?

256
00:15:43,017 --> 00:15:44,530
Could you have taken turns?

257
00:15:44,617 --> 00:15:47,973
Or were you too afraid
to freeze your big fat ass off?

258
00:15:49,097 --> 00:15:50,769
I guess that's how life is.

259
00:15:50,857 --> 00:15:55,214
Some people are drenched, freezing
on a stupid boat with a stupid hat,

260
00:15:55,297 --> 00:15:58,494
while others are in a news studio,
sucking up the glory.

261
00:15:58,577 --> 00:16:00,568
Oh, well. No big deal.

262
00:16:01,897 --> 00:16:05,287
The owner of the Maid Of The Mist.
Let's have a talk with him.

263
00:16:05,377 --> 00:16:08,255
Come on in here, Bill.
No, let's have a talk.

264
00:16:08,337 --> 00:16:10,248
What are you doing?

265
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:13,409
You've been running
the Maid Of The Mistfor 23 years.

266
00:16:13,497 --> 00:16:15,533
Why do you think
I didn't get anchor?

267
00:16:15,617 --> 00:16:18,051
- I don't want any problems.
- Is it my hair?

268
00:16:18,137 --> 00:16:21,254
Are my teeth not white enough?
Or, like the great falls,

269
00:16:21,337 --> 00:16:26,286
is the bedrock of my life
eroding beneath me?

270
00:16:26,377 --> 00:16:31,527
Eroding!

271
00:16:32,977 --> 00:16:35,537
- Cut the feed. Go to black.
- I'm on it.

272
00:16:37,137 --> 00:16:40,891
I'm Bruce Nolan, for Eyewitness News.
Back to you, fuckers!

273
00:16:42,497 --> 00:16:44,089
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, my God.

274
00:16:48,857 --> 00:16:50,529
That is perfect.

275
00:16:50,617 --> 00:16:53,415
That is the motivation that I needed!

276
00:16:53,497 --> 00:16:55,567
Right there! Thank you!

277
00:16:56,977 --> 00:17:00,094
Thank you, WKBW.

278
00:17:00,177 --> 00:17:03,487
Wimpy... Kitty Baby Whiners!

279
00:17:03,577 --> 00:17:05,568
That's what that stands for!

280
00:17:07,137 --> 00:17:09,412
I'll see you on Channel 5.

281
00:17:09,497 --> 00:17:11,533
Where they do the real news!

282
00:17:12,777 --> 00:17:14,768
Do I look blind to you?

283
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:19,893
Let's go, man. Come on.

284
00:17:20,617 --> 00:17:22,414
What are you doing?

285
00:17:22,497 --> 00:17:24,613
Come on. Leave the poor guy alone!

286
00:17:25,537 --> 00:17:27,687
You OK, man?

287
00:17:28,897 --> 00:17:30,808
Yeah, you better keep walking.

288
00:17:31,137 --> 00:17:34,174
- What'd you say, ese?
- Run, man!

289
00:17:34,257 --> 00:17:36,248
Run!

290
00:17:37,217 --> 00:17:39,253
Oh, God!

291
00:17:41,417 --> 00:17:43,328
OK, I didn't mean it!

292
00:17:43,857 --> 00:17:46,735
- I was just kidding!
- Hey, you forgot your things.

293
00:17:51,257 --> 00:17:53,248
Say something now!

294
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,415
B- E-A...

295
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:02,806
.. utiful.

296
00:18:06,137 --> 00:18:08,605
That's what I get...

297
00:18:08,697 --> 00:18:11,609
That's what I get
for trying to help someone.

298
00:18:13,537 --> 00:18:15,892
Don't look at me, Walter.

299
00:18:15,977 --> 00:18:17,968
Oh, no!

300
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:24,008
That's my payment, I guess.

301
00:18:24,097 --> 00:18:26,406
That is my reward.

302
00:18:31,217 --> 00:18:34,493
Just? Just get a clue!

303
00:18:35,737 --> 00:18:37,329
Thank God you're all right.

304
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:39,533
God, yeah. Let's thank God.

305
00:18:39,617 --> 00:18:42,256
For his blessings
are raining down upon me.

306
00:18:42,337 --> 00:18:45,249
- Wait! That's not rain!
- Bruce, please don't do that.

307
00:18:45,337 --> 00:18:47,851
Everything happens for a reason.

308
00:18:47,937 --> 00:18:51,009
That I don't need. That is a cliché.
That is not helpful.

309
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:53,565
"A bird in the hand
is worth two in the bush. "

310
00:18:53,657 --> 00:18:56,569
I have no bird! No bush!
God has taken my bird and my bush.

311
00:18:56,657 --> 00:18:59,694
I see. So God is picking on you?

312
00:18:59,777 --> 00:19:02,086
No! He's ignoring me completely.

313
00:19:03,097 --> 00:19:05,531
He's busy giving Evan
everything he wants.

314
00:19:06,617 --> 00:19:09,654
Great, Sam. But you missed
your target. I'm over here!

315
00:19:09,737 --> 00:19:12,012
Don't get mad at the dog.
It's not his fault.

316
00:19:12,097 --> 00:19:15,214
It's God's fault.
He gave him the wrong co-ordinates.

317
00:19:15,297 --> 00:19:17,731
Enough!
Will you stop being such a martyr?

318
00:19:17,817 --> 00:19:20,251
I am not being a martyr! I'm a victim!

319
00:19:20,337 --> 00:19:24,091
God is a mean kid with
a magniying glass, and I'm the ant.

320
00:19:24,177 --> 00:19:26,293
He could fix my life if he wanted,

321
00:19:26,377 --> 00:19:29,574
but he'd rather burn off my feelers
and watch me squirm.

322
00:19:29,657 --> 00:19:31,932
Sweetheart, I know you're mad.

323
00:19:32,017 --> 00:19:35,407
What Evan did was slimy and wrong.

324
00:19:35,497 --> 00:19:38,807
This day could have been so
much worse. I'm just glad you're OK.

325
00:19:39,017 --> 00:19:42,248
OK? News flash! I'm not OK.

326
00:19:42,337 --> 00:19:45,693
I'm not OK with a mediocre job!
Or a mediocre apartment!

327
00:19:45,777 --> 00:19:48,337
I'm not OK with a mediocre life!

328
00:19:56,497 --> 00:19:59,489
Is that what you think we have?
A mediocre life?

329
00:19:59,577 --> 00:20:01,488
Don't make this about you.

330
00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:05,013
About me?
How could I make this about me?

331
00:20:05,097 --> 00:20:08,214
It's about you. It's always about you.

332
00:20:08,297 --> 00:20:10,527
Perfect.

333
00:20:10,617 --> 00:20:14,895
I'll have the worst day of my life
with a side order of guilt, please!

334
00:20:20,377 --> 00:20:23,767
OK, God. You want me to talk to you?

335
00:20:24,217 --> 00:20:27,015
Then talk back.
Tell me what's going on.

336
00:20:27,097 --> 00:20:29,895
What should I do? Give me a signal.

337
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:36,085
I need your guidance, Lord.
Please, send me a sign.

338
00:20:40,017 --> 00:20:42,008
Oh, what's this joker doing now?

339
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:50,290
OK. All right. I'll try it your way.

340
00:20:51,057 --> 00:20:55,767
All right. Lord... I need a miracle.

341
00:20:57,097 --> 00:20:58,769
I'm desperate.

342
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:00,529
I need your help, Lord.

343
00:21:00,617 --> 00:21:02,847
Please, reach into my life...

344
00:21:05,577 --> 00:21:08,045
What the...? Where are you?

345
00:21:08,137 --> 00:21:10,128
Got you!

346
00:21:51,537 --> 00:21:52,856
Fine!

347
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:54,814
The gloves are off, pal!

348
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:57,252
Come on! Let me see a little wrath!

349
00:21:57,337 --> 00:22:01,012
Smite me, O mighty smiter!

350
00:22:01,857 --> 00:22:04,166
You're the one who should be fired!

351
00:22:04,257 --> 00:22:08,569
The only one around here
not doing his job is you!

352
00:22:09,577 --> 00:22:11,568
Answer me!

353
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:27,968
Sorry. Don't know you.

354
00:22:28,937 --> 00:22:30,928
Wouldn't call you if I did.

355
00:22:43,217 --> 00:22:45,208
Oh, God!

356
00:22:51,497 --> 00:22:53,931
Hello, 5550123.

357
00:23:17,337 --> 00:23:21,296
Oh, no! Sam, this has got to stop!

358
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:27,292
Get it straight. That's the house.
This is the bathroom.

359
00:23:27,377 --> 00:23:31,336
House, bathroom. Bathroom, house.

360
00:23:33,817 --> 00:23:35,535
What's the point?

361
00:23:59,057 --> 00:24:01,696
5550123.

362
00:24:04,177 --> 00:24:06,975
Denied thatpromotion?
Is life unfair?

363
00:24:07,057 --> 00:24:10,174
Is someone less talented than you
reaping the benefits?

364
00:24:10,257 --> 00:24:11,815
Is yourname Bruce?

365
00:24:11,897 --> 00:24:13,967
Then do we have thejob foryou!

366
00:24:14,057 --> 00:24:17,288
We're located at 7725623rd Street.

367
00:24:17,377 --> 00:24:20,687
So come on down -
or we'lljust keep beeping you.

368
00:24:37,097 --> 00:24:38,496
"Omni Presents. "

369
00:24:39,857 --> 00:24:43,008
Oh, yeah. The glass is half-full.

370
00:24:46,497 --> 00:24:49,409
Come on! Look! What is that?

371
00:24:54,737 --> 00:24:56,170
Thank you again.

372
00:25:03,737 --> 00:25:05,728
What the...?

373
00:25:12,537 --> 00:25:14,528
You're looking for room 7.

374
00:25:16,897 --> 00:25:19,934
- Yeah, I figured.
- Want me to even those up for you?

375
00:25:24,497 --> 00:25:27,534
- How do I get to room 7?
- That'd be on the 7th floor.

376
00:25:27,617 --> 00:25:31,087
- Stairs are over there.
- I'll take the elevator.

377
00:25:31,177 --> 00:25:34,692
- Out of order.
- The stairs were my second choice.

378
00:25:34,777 --> 00:25:37,371
Do you mind giving me a hand
with this floor?

379
00:25:37,457 --> 00:25:41,211
What? That's good.

380
00:25:41,297 --> 00:25:42,730
Are you serious?

381
00:25:44,977 --> 00:25:47,537
I'm kind of busy. Rain check.

382
00:25:48,777 --> 00:25:50,529
I'll hold you to it.

383
00:25:51,137 --> 00:25:53,731
I'm free on the 7th at 7.00.

384
00:25:56,897 --> 00:25:58,888
The 7th at 7.00 it is.

385
00:26:01,817 --> 00:26:04,092
This looks promising.

386
00:26:09,137 --> 00:26:11,048
Hello?

387
00:26:11,137 --> 00:26:14,527
Another hugantic,
ginormic waste of my life.

388
00:26:15,697 --> 00:26:17,688
Hello?

389
00:26:18,497 --> 00:26:20,692
I'm looking for whoever runs this joint!

390
00:26:20,777 --> 00:26:23,371
Be right with you. I'm fixing a light.

391
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:25,527
Tell me if it's working.

392
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:27,687
Yeah. Seems to be.

393
00:26:27,777 --> 00:26:31,565
- Kind of bright, though.
- Yeah. It is for most people.

394
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:35,809
Spend their lives in the dark,
trying to hide from me.

395
00:26:37,417 --> 00:26:39,487
The elevator's broken, huh?

396
00:26:39,577 --> 00:26:42,489
Yeah, but I'll get around to it.

397
00:26:43,737 --> 00:26:47,412
- You installed a clapper?
- No, but catchy jingle, isn't it?

398
00:26:48,097 --> 00:26:49,769
Clap on, clap off

399
00:26:51,177 --> 00:26:52,849
The clapper

400
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:56,171
Just can't get it out of my head.

401
00:26:56,257 --> 00:26:58,532
Well, good luck with that.

402
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,369
- I'm going to go now.
- OK.

403
00:27:00,457 --> 00:27:02,652
But the boss will be right out.

404
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:14,455
You must be Bruce.
I've been expecting you.

405
00:27:16,657 --> 00:27:18,409
This is hilarious.

406
00:27:18,497 --> 00:27:21,136
You're the boss,
electrician and janitor.

407
00:27:21,217 --> 00:27:23,128
Must be a killer Christmas party.

408
00:27:23,217 --> 00:27:26,527
Don't get drunk, though.
One of you might need a ride home.

409
00:27:27,857 --> 00:27:31,088
You always were funny, Bruce.
Just like your father.

410
00:27:31,937 --> 00:27:34,610
He didn't mind
rolling up his sleeves either.

411
00:27:34,697 --> 00:27:39,373
People underestimate the benefit of
manual labour. There's freedom in it.

412
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:43,496
Some of the happiest people smell to
high heaven at the end of the day.

413
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:46,533
All right, what is this?

414
00:27:46,657 --> 00:27:49,535
How do you know my father
and how did you get my number?

415
00:27:49,617 --> 00:27:51,335
I know a lot about you, Bruce.

416
00:27:52,777 --> 00:27:55,086
Just about everything there is to know.

417
00:27:56,017 --> 00:28:00,647
Everything you've ever said or done
or thought about doing.

418
00:28:01,617 --> 00:28:04,211
Right there in that file cabinet.

419
00:28:04,897 --> 00:28:08,333
- Wow! A whole drawer, just for me.
- Yeah.

420
00:28:08,417 --> 00:28:10,806
Mind if I take a look?

421
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:13,331
It's your life.

422
00:28:13,417 --> 00:28:15,408
This oughta be good.

423
00:28:29,137 --> 00:28:31,412
This last entry was a little disturbing.

424
00:28:43,177 --> 00:28:45,133
"The gloves are off, God. "

425
00:28:45,217 --> 00:28:47,685
"God has taken my bird and my bush. "

426
00:28:47,777 --> 00:28:51,053
"God is a mean kid
with a magniying glass. "

427
00:28:51,137 --> 00:28:54,288
"Smite me, O mighty smiter. "

428
00:28:54,377 --> 00:28:58,290
I'm not much for blaspheming,
but that last one made me laugh.

429
00:28:58,377 --> 00:29:00,368
Are you spying on me?

430
00:29:03,697 --> 00:29:06,165
Who are you?

431
00:29:06,257 --> 00:29:08,248
I am the One.

432
00:29:08,337 --> 00:29:11,454
Creator of the heavens and the earth.
Alpha and Omega.

433
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:15,092
I see where this is going.

434
00:29:15,177 --> 00:29:17,850
Bruce... I am God.

435
00:29:17,937 --> 00:29:19,893
Bingo! Yahtzee!

436
00:29:19,977 --> 00:29:23,936
Is that your final answer?
Our survey says, "God!"

437
00:29:25,577 --> 00:29:27,329
It was nice to meet you, God.

438
00:29:27,417 --> 00:29:30,887
Thanks for the Grand Canyon.
Good luck with the Apocalypse.

439
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:34,287
And by the way, you suck!

440
00:29:34,377 --> 00:29:36,333
It would have been more impressive

441
00:29:36,417 --> 00:29:39,375
if you hadn't used
the cheesy file cabinet illusion.

442
00:29:39,457 --> 00:29:42,130
Anybody with a brain stem
can tell that drawer

443
00:29:42,217 --> 00:29:44,811
is being fed through the wall
from the other side.

444
00:29:44,897 --> 00:29:47,809
All you have to do
is find the crease right around here.

445
00:29:47,897 --> 00:29:51,173
There is a seam here, or a hollow spot.

446
00:29:55,777 --> 00:29:57,608
Where?

447
00:29:57,697 --> 00:29:59,688
Through the dry wall and concrete?

448
00:30:02,617 --> 00:30:05,495
OK, that is a good one.

449
00:30:06,177 --> 00:30:10,455
- How many fingers am I holding up?
- Thou shalt not tempt the Lord.

450
00:30:10,537 --> 00:30:12,368
- If you can't do it...
- Three.

451
00:30:12,457 --> 00:30:14,448
Two... four... nine.

452
00:30:14,537 --> 00:30:16,289
Six... eight... one.

453
00:30:18,697 --> 00:30:20,096
OK.

454
00:30:20,857 --> 00:30:22,654
How many now?

455
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,011
Seven.

456
00:30:28,857 --> 00:30:32,486
- How?
- You've been complaining about me.

457
00:30:32,577 --> 00:30:35,535
- I'm tired of it.
- Don't come near me. Seriously.

458
00:30:35,617 --> 00:30:38,654
I don't want to hurt you,
but I will out of instinct.

459
00:30:38,737 --> 00:30:42,446
You haven't won a fight since
grade 5, and that was against a girl.

460
00:30:44,017 --> 00:30:46,690
But she was huge.
She'd been held back.

461
00:30:46,777 --> 00:30:48,847
And the sun was in your eyes.

462
00:30:48,937 --> 00:30:50,814
Ah, the ego.

463
00:30:50,897 --> 00:30:53,457
Anyway, I brought you here
to offer you a job.

464
00:30:53,537 --> 00:30:56,051
- A job? What job?
- My job.

465
00:30:56,137 --> 00:30:59,334
You think you can do it better,
so here's your chance.

466
00:30:59,417 --> 00:31:03,376
When you leave this building,
you will be endowed with all my powers.

467
00:31:04,297 --> 00:31:06,174
Sure. Whatever you say, pal.

468
00:31:09,217 --> 00:31:12,926
OK. That did not happen.
No one needs to hear about it.

469
00:31:13,017 --> 00:31:15,008
I'm deleting the program.

470
00:31:16,697 --> 00:31:18,335
No.

471
00:31:18,417 --> 00:31:20,214
I'm having a breakdown.

472
00:31:20,297 --> 00:31:23,767
Everyday psychotic episode,
caused by a tumour, a brain lesion.

473
00:31:24,657 --> 00:31:26,568
Come on. Start!

474
00:31:28,537 --> 00:31:30,528
That was lucky.

475
00:31:34,977 --> 00:31:36,854
Come on. Calm down.

476
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:39,735
You did not meet God.
You do not have his powers.

477
00:31:40,457 --> 00:31:42,732
If that was God, I'm Clint Eastwood.

478
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:44,808
Holy hell!

479
00:31:50,297 --> 00:31:53,209
Be careful what you wish for, punk.

480
00:31:53,617 --> 00:31:55,096
Nope!

481
00:31:56,457 --> 00:32:00,052
I am a reasonable,
sane human being.

482
00:32:00,137 --> 00:32:01,889
With a. 44 Magnum.

483
00:32:01,977 --> 00:32:04,286
The most powerful handgun in the...

484
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:09,045
I'm not Clint Eastwood.
I'm Bruce Nolan.

485
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:11,128
I'm Bruce Nolan!

486
00:32:24,737 --> 00:32:26,728
That was not real.

487
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:31,336
- Coffee?
- Coffee, yeah.

488
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:33,328
We have a special on soup today.

489
00:32:33,417 --> 00:32:37,410
- No, thank you.
- It's tomato. I made it myself.

490
00:32:38,817 --> 00:32:40,409
OK.

491
00:33:13,137 --> 00:33:15,128
Excuse me, I need a spoo-...

492
00:33:22,057 --> 00:33:24,048
It's OK. I found one.

493
00:33:31,137 --> 00:33:32,855
Here's your soup.

494
00:33:32,937 --> 00:33:34,495
Oh, soup, right.

495
00:33:34,577 --> 00:33:36,568
Yeah, right.

496
00:34:24,057 --> 00:34:26,048
Having fun?

497
00:34:28,497 --> 00:34:30,055
Thy, thou...

498
00:34:30,137 --> 00:34:32,776
Come. Take a closer walk with me.

499
00:34:34,377 --> 00:34:36,527
- Let me explain the rules.
- Rules?

500
00:34:36,617 --> 00:34:40,246
You left in such a rush,
I didn't get a chance to explain.

501
00:34:41,577 --> 00:34:44,569
The two extra fingers
freaked me out a little.

502
00:34:44,657 --> 00:34:47,012
I figured I'd get your attention.

503
00:34:47,097 --> 00:34:50,169
I did the same to Gandhi.
He didn't eat for three weeks.

504
00:34:51,257 --> 00:34:53,009
Anyway, here's the deal.

505
00:34:53,097 --> 00:34:56,055
You have all my powers.
Use them any way you choose.

506
00:34:56,137 --> 00:34:59,209
There are two rules.
You can't tell anybody you're God.

507
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:03,654
Believe me, you don't want the attention.
And you can't mess with free will.

508
00:35:07,057 --> 00:35:10,288
- Can I ask why?
- Yes! You can!

509
00:35:10,377 --> 00:35:12,368
That's the beauty of it.

510
00:35:19,457 --> 00:35:23,291
- This is amazing.
- Speaking of amazing, excuse me.

511
00:35:26,337 --> 00:35:29,409
Holy sh-... Cow.

512
00:35:29,897 --> 00:35:32,650
Since you're through with these,
I'll keep them.

513
00:35:33,337 --> 00:35:35,646
Might come in handy some day.

514
00:35:36,297 --> 00:35:38,253
See you around, kid.

515
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:42,127
- Where are you going?
- I'm... taking a vacation.

516
00:35:42,217 --> 00:35:43,935
God doesn't take vacations.

517
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:45,973
Does he? Do... ye?

518
00:35:46,497 --> 00:35:48,727
Did you ever hear of the Dark Ages?

519
00:35:48,817 --> 00:35:52,890
I'm covered. You can clear everything up
in five minutes if you want.

520
00:35:52,977 --> 00:35:54,569
Right?

521
00:36:38,817 --> 00:36:41,092
And he saw that it was good.

522
00:37:05,017 --> 00:37:08,453
B- E-A-utiful!

523
00:37:13,577 --> 00:37:15,568
Check it out.

524
00:37:17,217 --> 00:37:19,014
Look, it's the hero.

525
00:37:19,097 --> 00:37:21,895
- Whassup, homie?
- Yo, brethren, what up with thee?

526
00:37:23,097 --> 00:37:26,612
- Blessings on your alley.
- Want another can of whup ass?

527
00:37:26,697 --> 00:37:29,848
- You didn't get enough?
- He wants some more!

528
00:37:29,937 --> 00:37:33,896
Surely, I say unto you dudes,
I do not wish to fight.

529
00:37:33,977 --> 00:37:37,970
So as soon as you apologise and make
a reckoning of your transgressions,

530
00:37:38,057 --> 00:37:41,572
I shall absolve you and continue
along the path of righteousness.

531
00:37:42,097 --> 00:37:44,088
What are you talking about?

532
00:37:46,137 --> 00:37:50,369
You talk kind of funny. I don't know
if you lost it up here or what.

533
00:37:50,457 --> 00:37:53,529
You want me and the homies
to apologise? Cool.

534
00:37:53,617 --> 00:37:58,168
We'll apologise the day a monkey
comes out of my butt. How about that?

535
00:38:01,657 --> 00:38:04,649
What a coincidence!
Because that's today.

536
00:38:22,017 --> 00:38:24,326
Did that monkey
just come out your crack?

537
00:38:29,017 --> 00:38:32,373
This is some voodoo shit!

538
00:38:32,857 --> 00:38:34,848
You guys leaving?

539
00:38:36,097 --> 00:38:38,088
Don't forget your parting gifts!

540
00:39:04,137 --> 00:39:06,697
Hey, little anal-dwelling butt monkey.

541
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:09,450
Time for you to go home.

542
00:39:22,137 --> 00:39:24,446
I am Bruce Almighty.

543
00:39:24,537 --> 00:39:27,290
My will be done!

544
00:39:37,137 --> 00:39:40,095
What if God was one of us

545
00:39:40,857 --> 00:39:43,371
Just a slob like one of us

546
00:39:44,337 --> 00:39:46,805
Just a stranger on a bus

547
00:39:46,897 --> 00:39:48,888
Trying to make his way

548
00:39:49,817 --> 00:39:53,048
Home

549
00:39:53,137 --> 00:39:55,093
- My God.
- Call me Bruce.

550
00:39:55,177 --> 00:39:57,293
What happened to you? You seem so...

551
00:40:02,017 --> 00:40:03,370
happy.

552
00:40:03,457 --> 00:40:06,017
Why shouldn't I be? On a night like this.

553
00:40:06,097 --> 00:40:08,850
Those are amazing. What are these?

554
00:40:08,937 --> 00:40:12,373
A new breed. A cross-pollination
between tulips and daisies.

555
00:40:12,457 --> 00:40:15,017
I call them todayzees.

556
00:40:16,617 --> 00:40:18,608
OK.

557
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:26,606
Honey, these flowers are beautiful.

558
00:40:27,337 --> 00:40:30,090
- But last night...
- Last night, I was only human.

559
00:40:35,137 --> 00:40:37,128
Barry, help me out.

560
00:41:32,897 --> 00:41:34,888
Honey? Hi.

561
00:41:35,617 --> 00:41:39,007
- I've never seen the moon that big.
- Yeah.

562
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:41,688
We really shouldn't waste it.

563
00:41:51,897 --> 00:41:53,808
Bedroom?

564
00:41:53,897 --> 00:41:55,888
Five minutes.

565
00:42:04,537 --> 00:42:06,528
Let there be light.

566
00:42:09,697 --> 00:42:11,688
I'll be out in a minute!

567
00:42:12,417 --> 00:42:14,089
Don't rush.

568
00:42:14,177 --> 00:42:17,089
Sometimes anticipation
can heighten the...

569
00:42:17,177 --> 00:42:18,246
pleasure!

570
00:42:18,337 --> 00:42:20,328
Oh, God.

571
00:42:22,257 --> 00:42:24,896
It's a funny thing about pleasure.

572
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:30,256
It can be quite... pleasurable!

573
00:42:33,097 --> 00:42:35,088
Oh, my God.

574
00:42:35,737 --> 00:42:37,728
Pleasuring, pleasurable.

575
00:42:40,857 --> 00:42:42,210
Oh, good God!

576
00:42:51,577 --> 00:42:53,408
In international news:

577
00:42:53,497 --> 00:42:57,536
Japanese reliefworkers are staging an
effort to rescue hundreds ofpeople

578
00:42:57,617 --> 00:43:00,973
stranded by a freak tidal wave
that hit Kitamoto City.

579
00:43:01,057 --> 00:43:03,696
Scientists say the tsunami
may have been caused

580
00:43:03,777 --> 00:43:07,770
by what they are describing
as unusual lunaractivity.

581
00:43:07,857 --> 00:43:09,848
More on this as it develops.

582
00:43:13,537 --> 00:43:18,167
Please bless my mommy, my daddy,
and especially my little sister.

583
00:43:20,057 --> 00:43:23,413
Please help me, Lord.
Please get me through this one.

584
00:43:30,097 --> 00:43:33,089
Thank you foreverything else
in my life. Amen.

585
00:43:57,857 --> 00:44:00,007
Good boy.

586
00:44:01,617 --> 00:44:03,608
Forget something?

587
00:44:06,737 --> 00:44:09,490
Good boy! There are girls in the house.

588
00:44:13,697 --> 00:44:15,688
- Morning.
- Good morning.

589
00:44:15,777 --> 00:44:18,769
- I made you grilled cheese.
- My favi.

590
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:22,933
- Honey, last night was...
- Heavenly. I know.

591
00:44:23,017 --> 00:44:27,408
I mean, I woke up and I felt like
my boobs were bigger.

592
00:44:27,497 --> 00:44:30,489
- Do they look bigger to you?
- What?

593
00:44:30,577 --> 00:44:32,613
No.

594
00:44:32,697 --> 00:44:35,165
- Bigger?
- Oh, come on!

595
00:44:35,257 --> 00:44:36,975
Look at them.

596
00:44:37,057 --> 00:44:39,207
Please. They are definitely bigger.

597
00:44:39,297 --> 00:44:41,857
I mean, look. They feel huge to me.

598
00:44:41,937 --> 00:44:43,768
I have to go.

599
00:44:43,857 --> 00:44:46,132
But this has been the breast bek...

600
00:44:48,257 --> 00:44:49,485
Thank you.

601
00:44:49,577 --> 00:44:53,013
- Where are you going?
- To get my job back.

602
00:44:54,257 --> 00:44:58,535
Yeah, yeah, I am great

603
00:45:01,937 --> 00:45:04,610
Good grief! Is that what I'm driving?

604
00:45:15,377 --> 00:45:16,969
Nice car, man.

605
00:45:17,057 --> 00:45:19,446
Yeah, it gets me from A to B.

606
00:45:32,097 --> 00:45:35,294
Darn. All this horsepower
and no room to gallop!

607
00:45:38,737 --> 00:45:41,729
Hi-yo, Silver. Away!

608
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:51,374
I wouldn't want to be a fugitive

609
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:55,336
with Hank, Buffalo's number one
police dog, on the job.

610
00:45:55,417 --> 00:45:59,888
Phil Sidleman at the police canine
training centre, Channel 5 News.

611
00:45:59,977 --> 00:46:01,968
And cut it.

612
00:46:07,337 --> 00:46:08,850
Look what the cat coughed up!

613
00:46:08,937 --> 00:46:11,815
Channel 7, right?
You're the guy that went crazy.

614
00:46:11,897 --> 00:46:15,048
- I had a bad moment.
- What are you doing here?

615
00:46:15,137 --> 00:46:17,253
- Looking for a story.
- No story here.

616
00:46:17,337 --> 00:46:21,694
This pond is all fished out.
Pretty standard stuff, anyway.

617
00:46:21,777 --> 00:46:24,974
My instinct tells me
there's something more.

618
00:46:25,057 --> 00:46:28,049
Well, go with that.
It served you well in the past, right?

619
00:46:35,977 --> 00:46:37,808
Hank found something!

620
00:46:39,497 --> 00:46:41,488
We got a body!

621
00:46:42,457 --> 00:46:44,448
Shit. Get the camera! Now!

622
00:46:45,217 --> 00:46:48,766
- It's locked! The keys are inside!
- I guess every dog has his day.

623
00:46:49,217 --> 00:46:51,492
- Kid, you want to make $10?
- Sure.

624
00:46:51,577 --> 00:46:53,966
- Know how to use one of these?
- Duh.

625
00:46:55,857 --> 00:46:58,246
Seems to be in tune. Let's do this.

626
00:46:58,337 --> 00:47:01,329
The body of Jimmy Hoffa
was uncovered in a field today

627
00:47:01,417 --> 00:47:04,454
outside a canine training centre
in Buffalo, New York.

628
00:47:04,537 --> 00:47:08,007
- Bruce Nolan was first on the scene.
- Thank you, Jane.

629
00:47:08,097 --> 00:47:11,169
As you can see,
the body is being carefully exhumed

630
00:47:11,257 --> 00:47:15,614
for transportation to a facility
where DNA can confirm the identity.

631
00:47:15,697 --> 00:47:18,575
That, however,
merely a formality at this point,

632
00:47:18,657 --> 00:47:24,129
as the body was found with a birth
certificate and dental records.

633
00:47:24,217 --> 00:47:26,890
I'd call that a red-letter day
for any canine unit.

634
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:29,571
But was that enough for Hank?
No, siree.

635
00:47:29,657 --> 00:47:32,888
Moments later, he busted
a local news camera crew

636
00:47:32,977 --> 00:47:36,174
with 220 pounds of marijuana.

637
00:47:36,257 --> 00:47:38,612
I never saw it before! I swear!

638
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:43,773
I'm Bruce Nolan...

639
00:47:43,857 --> 00:47:46,690
and that's the way
the cookie crumbles.

640
00:47:51,097 --> 00:47:53,088
Did you like that?

641
00:47:55,417 --> 00:47:57,248
Thank you, thank you.

642
00:47:57,337 --> 00:47:59,248
- Hi, Bruce.
- Hi, Susan.

643
00:47:59,337 --> 00:48:01,771
Good work. I'm impressed.

644
00:48:05,737 --> 00:48:08,570
- Did you need me for something?
- Bruce!

645
00:48:08,657 --> 00:48:10,613
Just the man I want to see.

646
00:48:10,697 --> 00:48:14,770
- Hoffa? What are the odds of that?
- What are the odds of that?

647
00:48:14,857 --> 00:48:16,927
- Bruce, why don't you sit down?
- OK.

648
00:48:17,017 --> 00:48:20,646
I'm going to be straight with you.
We want you back, Bruce.

649
00:48:20,737 --> 00:48:24,127
But I want you to understand
it was not my decision to let you go.

650
00:48:24,817 --> 00:48:27,729
- When the big guy gives the order...
- No harm, no foul.

651
00:48:27,817 --> 00:48:31,332
I needed to reassess my goals
and get in touch with my true self.

652
00:48:31,417 --> 00:48:34,454
- You did that in a day?
- Imagine what I could do with seven.

653
00:48:35,577 --> 00:48:38,375
It is not in my power
to give you anchor.

654
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:41,767
As far as field reporting goes,
if you're looking for a bump...

655
00:48:41,857 --> 00:48:44,894
Let's cut the crap
and get down to brass tacks.

656
00:48:49,657 --> 00:48:51,375
I had you going.

657
00:48:51,457 --> 00:48:53,573
Don't worry about it,
my old friend.

658
00:48:54,497 --> 00:48:57,170
Just give me a camera.
I'll give you the news.

659
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:11,016
My secret is that I let the jalapenos
marinate in a spicy sauce

660
00:49:11,097 --> 00:49:15,170
for at least 24 hours
before I stir it into the chilli.

661
00:49:15,257 --> 00:49:17,976
Then I let it all come to a simmer.

662
00:49:22,657 --> 00:49:27,856
Hold that thought. It seems as if
an asteroid or meteorite

663
00:49:27,937 --> 00:49:31,612
has just hit ground right outside
the Mark Twain Chilli Cook-Off!

664
00:49:32,337 --> 00:49:34,851
This should certainly
spice things up a bit!

665
00:49:35,457 --> 00:49:37,175
His stories are all over town.

666
00:49:37,257 --> 00:49:38,531
From unearthing Hoffa

667
00:49:38,617 --> 00:49:40,608
.. to a meteor crashing,

668
00:49:40,697 --> 00:49:43,894
.. Bruce Nolan is rapidly
becoming known as...

669
00:49:58,017 --> 00:50:01,487
And that's the way
the cookie crumbles!

670
00:50:05,937 --> 00:50:08,292
This was Bruce's idea?

671
00:50:08,377 --> 00:50:12,689
He wanted me to have a day of beauty
and luxurious serenity.

672
00:50:14,337 --> 00:50:17,534
I got to tell you,
he is impressing me lately.

673
00:50:17,617 --> 00:50:19,687
Know where he's taking me to dinner?

674
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:22,769
Where?

675
00:50:24,497 --> 00:50:26,055
The Blue Palm?

676
00:50:27,897 --> 00:50:30,809
- My gosh, I got chills.
- I know.

677
00:50:30,897 --> 00:50:34,606
He told me to prepare for the most
memorable night of our lives.

678
00:50:34,697 --> 00:50:37,336
Oh, my gosh. He's going to propose.

679
00:50:37,417 --> 00:50:39,373
Oh, stop it. No. He's...

680
00:50:39,457 --> 00:50:42,130
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

681
00:50:42,217 --> 00:50:45,209
Do the math.
He sends you all day to a beauty spa,

682
00:50:45,297 --> 00:50:49,176
he's taking you to a restaurant
where you had your first date. Hello!

683
00:50:49,257 --> 00:50:51,896
I never thought I'd say this,
but Bruce is right.

684
00:50:51,977 --> 00:50:54,172
This is your night.
Relax and enjoy it.

685
00:50:54,257 --> 00:50:56,293
Oh, God.

686
00:51:00,297 --> 00:51:03,653
Welcome to Eyewitness News at Six,
with Susan Ortega,

687
00:51:03,737 --> 00:51:05,090
Evan Baxter,

688
00:51:05,177 --> 00:51:07,850
Fred Donohue, sports,
Dallas Coleman, weather.

689
00:51:07,937 --> 00:51:10,212
And now,
Buffalo's numberone news team.

690
00:51:10,297 --> 00:51:12,253
Welcome to Eyewitness News at Six.

691
00:51:12,337 --> 00:51:14,328
- I'm Susan Ortega.
- I'm Evan Baxter.

692
00:51:14,417 --> 00:51:16,373
Here's what's making news.

693
00:51:16,457 --> 00:51:19,688
A potential scandal
with the Buffalo PD surfaced today,

694
00:51:19,777 --> 00:51:21,893
when the mayor demanded that...

695
00:51:22,897 --> 00:51:25,206
When the mayor
demanded the chief of...

696
00:51:27,977 --> 00:51:29,968
Issued a response to...

697
00:51:30,697 --> 00:51:32,892
I seem to have something stuck in my...

698
00:51:32,977 --> 00:51:34,854
Get him some water.

699
00:51:34,937 --> 00:51:37,451
Looks like my new co-anchor
may need water.

700
00:51:42,297 --> 00:51:44,128
There we go. Sorry.

701
00:51:44,217 --> 00:51:48,972
In other news, the prime minister of
Sweden visited Washington today,

702
00:51:49,057 --> 00:51:52,094
and my tiny little nipples
went to France.

703
00:51:52,937 --> 00:51:55,053
What did he say? Check the prompter.

704
00:51:58,457 --> 00:52:01,176
- The prompter's fine.
- Evan, read the copy.

705
00:52:01,257 --> 00:52:02,975
The copy's good. Just read it.

706
00:52:03,657 --> 00:52:07,252
The White House committee
greeted the prime rib roast minister,

707
00:52:07,337 --> 00:52:10,488
and I do the cha-cha like a sissy girl.

708
00:52:12,297 --> 00:52:14,936
I lika do...

709
00:52:15,017 --> 00:52:17,008
da cha-cha.

710
00:52:21,017 --> 00:52:24,646
I'm sorry. We seem to be
having technical difficulties.

711
00:52:25,017 --> 00:52:26,814
In other news...

712
00:52:29,657 --> 00:52:31,648
My apologies.

713
00:53:21,457 --> 00:53:24,529
If I ruled the world

714
00:53:25,897 --> 00:53:29,936
Every day would be
the first day of spring

715
00:53:31,577 --> 00:53:35,889
Every heart would have
a new song to sing

716
00:53:37,137 --> 00:53:42,734
And we'd sing of the joy
every morning would bring

717
00:53:44,297 --> 00:53:46,606
If I ruled the world

718
00:53:48,817 --> 00:53:52,207
Every man would be
as free as a bird

719
00:53:52,297 --> 00:53:54,288
- May I?
- Certainly.

720
00:53:59,497 --> 00:54:02,330
It's perfect. She'll love it.

721
00:54:02,417 --> 00:54:06,205
We would treasure
each day that occurs

722
00:54:06,857 --> 00:54:12,534
You know, I was going to wait
until after the meal,

723
00:54:13,257 --> 00:54:16,806
but it'll burst out of me
like an alien if I don't do it now.

724
00:54:18,177 --> 00:54:20,213
Oh, my God. OK.

725
00:54:20,297 --> 00:54:22,015
This is it, isn't it?

726
00:54:22,097 --> 00:54:24,850
I don't know if I'm ready for this.

727
00:54:24,937 --> 00:54:29,647
I mean, I'm ready. I just didn't
know if I would... I'm sorry, go on.

728
00:54:29,737 --> 00:54:33,047
- I didn't know it was so important to you.
- Me neither.

729
00:54:36,937 --> 00:54:38,928
- Grace?
- Yes?

730
00:54:46,497 --> 00:54:48,488
I got anchor.

731
00:54:49,217 --> 00:54:50,616
No.

732
00:54:52,137 --> 00:54:56,176
Yes. Apparently it wasn't
working out with Evan,

733
00:54:56,257 --> 00:55:00,535
so he's going to finish out the week
and I go live on Monday.

734
00:55:02,417 --> 00:55:06,171
- That's great, honey.
- I know, I know.

735
00:55:06,257 --> 00:55:07,849
Well...

736
00:55:10,097 --> 00:55:12,850
- So that's what this is all about.
- Well, yeah.

737
00:55:14,297 --> 00:55:15,730
We got anchor.

738
00:55:15,817 --> 00:55:19,332
Jack's throwing me a party at
the Vanderbilt estate to celebrate.

739
00:55:19,417 --> 00:55:21,294
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

740
00:55:21,857 --> 00:55:25,008
Now I lay me down to sleep...

741
00:55:25,097 --> 00:55:26,974
I feel stupid.

742
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:29,776
- It is loud in here, isn't it?
- No, it's not loud.

743
00:55:29,857 --> 00:55:33,054
Jeez! Can you keep it down
to a dull roar?

744
00:55:33,137 --> 00:55:35,651
- Thank you!
- Is that supposed to be funny?

745
00:55:35,737 --> 00:55:38,410
Cos that is not funny.

746
00:55:38,497 --> 00:55:41,853
- What did you say?
- What is wrong with you? Stop yelling.

747
00:55:44,057 --> 00:55:47,049
If you'll excuse me,
I'll take a little trip to the...

748
00:55:47,137 --> 00:55:49,048
Ourfather, which art in heaven...

749
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:51,810
The wine is going right through me.

750
00:55:51,897 --> 00:55:55,014
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

751
00:55:55,097 --> 00:55:57,213
- Keep going, Tony!
- Oh, God.

752
00:55:59,617 --> 00:56:01,448
What is going on here?

753
00:56:01,537 --> 00:56:03,414
What is this?

754
00:56:03,497 --> 00:56:05,488
Give me a break!

755
00:56:10,297 --> 00:56:12,288
Really something, isn't it?

756
00:56:14,857 --> 00:56:16,654
Is this heaven?

757
00:56:16,737 --> 00:56:19,205
No, this is Mount Everest.

758
00:56:19,297 --> 00:56:22,255
Flip on the Discovery Channel
from time to time.

759
00:56:22,657 --> 00:56:26,093
But I guess you can't now,
being dead and all.

760
00:56:27,257 --> 00:56:30,135
- I'm dead?
- I'm just messing with you.

761
00:56:30,577 --> 00:56:33,091
That's not funny, man!

762
00:56:35,097 --> 00:56:38,726
What about the voices in my head?
Is that part of the hilarity?

763
00:56:38,817 --> 00:56:43,015
No, those are prayers. You keep ignoring
them, they're going to build up.

764
00:56:43,097 --> 00:56:45,770
But it's just noise.
I can't understand them.

765
00:56:46,457 --> 00:56:49,096
You're not listening, son.

766
00:56:49,177 --> 00:56:51,452
Let's see.

767
00:56:51,537 --> 00:56:55,416
You had my powers for a little over a week.
How many people have you helped?

768
00:56:59,497 --> 00:57:01,453
I took care of a few things.

769
00:57:01,537 --> 00:57:04,654
I righted a few wrongs
in my own life first. OK?

770
00:57:04,737 --> 00:57:06,807
I was going to help the others.

771
00:57:06,897 --> 00:57:09,889
- I think I could help the world.
- The world?

772
00:57:10,457 --> 00:57:15,008
That wasn't the world. That was just
Buffalo, between 57th and Commonwealth.

773
00:57:18,177 --> 00:57:21,408
I didn't want to start you off with
more than you could handle.

774
00:57:21,497 --> 00:57:24,773
You took the job, Bruce,
so I suggest you get to it.

775
00:57:26,337 --> 00:57:29,170
Seeing him smile
would make me so happy.

776
00:57:29,257 --> 00:57:31,248
Prayers, prayers, OK.

777
00:57:32,577 --> 00:57:34,613
This creepy whisper thing has to end.

778
00:57:34,697 --> 00:57:36,767
Organisation. That's what I need.

779
00:57:36,857 --> 00:57:40,770
I need a system.
Something concrete. Concentrate.

780
00:57:41,897 --> 00:57:46,129
Files. Let all prayers
be organised into files.

781
00:57:50,737 --> 00:57:55,367
That takes care of the voices.
Not exactly a space-saver, though.

782
00:57:55,457 --> 00:57:57,766
Grace might notice.

783
00:57:57,857 --> 00:58:00,166
I know. Prayer Post-its!

784
00:58:14,577 --> 00:58:18,775
OK, I need something with a lock.
Security. Combination. A password.

785
00:58:20,137 --> 00:58:21,536
A password.

786
00:58:27,897 --> 00:58:30,889
Welcome to the revelation
superhighway.

787
00:58:30,977 --> 00:58:33,889
We bless, no mess. Downloading now.

788
00:58:37,497 --> 00:58:39,613
It's good.

789
00:58:41,537 --> 00:58:43,653
This is going to take a while.

790
00:58:49,377 --> 00:58:53,848
1,527,503 prayer requests?

791
00:58:56,057 --> 00:58:58,048
I better manifest some coffee.

792
00:59:17,377 --> 00:59:21,165
Now that's fresh, mountain-grown
coffee from the hills of Colombia.

793
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:44,653
Good.

794
00:59:48,457 --> 00:59:52,052
OK, I had to have made
some kind of a dent by now.

795
00:59:54,497 --> 00:59:56,488
Oh, come on!

796
00:59:57,857 --> 01:00:01,486
What a bunch of whiners.
This is going to suck up my whole life.

797
01:00:03,097 --> 01:00:05,088
You know what?

798
01:00:07,137 --> 01:00:09,128
Yes. To all.

799
01:00:10,097 --> 01:00:14,090
Yeah. There you go.
Now everybody's happy.

800
01:00:22,297 --> 01:00:26,051
I'll drink to that. My tech stocks
tripled in five days.

801
01:00:26,137 --> 01:00:28,253
Know something, Joe?
You seem taller.

802
01:00:28,337 --> 01:00:30,897
- I am.
- My daughter pitched a no-hitter.

803
01:00:30,977 --> 01:00:33,969
I lost 47 pounds
on the Krispy Kreme diet.

804
01:00:34,057 --> 01:00:35,570
There he is!

805
01:00:35,657 --> 01:00:37,295
The man of the hour!

806
01:00:37,377 --> 01:00:40,972
Bless you! Bless all of you!

807
01:00:41,057 --> 01:00:44,891
Be fruitful and...
do long division or something!

808
01:00:45,857 --> 01:00:48,246
Try that. It's an excellent year.

809
01:00:48,337 --> 01:00:50,805
Bruce!
Who do you like in the game tonight?

810
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:54,094
I like the Sabres. Coach prays a lot.

811
01:01:14,657 --> 01:01:17,455
This is Bruce, Grace and Sam.
Leave a message.

812
01:01:17,537 --> 01:01:19,209
Grace? Are you there?

813
01:01:19,297 --> 01:01:20,616
Hello? It's me.

814
01:01:23,737 --> 01:01:25,853
Come on, Grace. Come to the party.

815
01:01:26,737 --> 01:01:28,773
I'll call you later, OK?

816
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:32,928
Come on, Sam.

817
01:01:35,657 --> 01:01:37,648
Help me out here.

818
01:01:39,977 --> 01:01:41,808
Sam, don't. Come on.

819
01:01:41,897 --> 01:01:44,411
- Tell me.
- Ifl do, it might not come true.

820
01:01:44,497 --> 01:01:48,888
What is ityou want, Mary?
You want the moon?

821
01:01:48,977 --> 01:01:52,287
Say the word and I'll throw a lasso
around it andpull it down.

822
01:01:52,377 --> 01:01:56,086
H.ey, that's a pretty good idea.
I'll give you the moon, Mary.

823
01:01:56,177 --> 01:01:58,088
I'll take it.

824
01:01:58,177 --> 01:02:00,850
- Then what?
- Then you could swallow it.

825
01:02:00,937 --> 01:02:03,053
And it'd all dissolve.

826
01:02:03,137 --> 01:02:06,015
Moonbeams would shoot out
ofyourfingers and toes

827
01:02:06,097 --> 01:02:08,452
and the ends ofyourhair.

828
01:02:19,537 --> 01:02:21,528
This is Bruce, Grace and Sam.

829
01:02:23,297 --> 01:02:25,288
Hi, Bruce.

830
01:02:27,377 --> 01:02:29,368
What are you doing in here all alone?

831
01:02:29,457 --> 01:02:31,175
Oh, I was just going to...

832
01:02:31,257 --> 01:02:33,248
I mean...

833
01:02:35,617 --> 01:02:38,211
I was going to give Grace a call.

834
01:02:38,537 --> 01:02:42,132
Yeah, I didn't see her.
So how are you and Grace doing?

835
01:02:43,137 --> 01:02:45,731
Well, actually, we had a bit of a fight.

836
01:02:46,417 --> 01:02:49,090
Kind of. I'm not sure if she's...

837
01:02:49,177 --> 01:02:51,247
You're on fire, Bruce.

838
01:02:51,737 --> 01:02:53,329
Some women can't handle fire.

839
01:02:54,617 --> 01:02:56,653
Some can.

840
01:02:56,737 --> 01:03:01,253
That's interesting, cos I never
thought we would ever talk...

841
01:03:20,977 --> 01:03:23,696
You might want to stop
touching me now.

842
01:03:27,777 --> 01:03:29,813
Grace, come here!

843
01:03:30,817 --> 01:03:32,808
This is weird. I was just calling you.

844
01:03:32,897 --> 01:03:35,286
And you thought Susan's mouth
was the phone?

845
01:03:36,177 --> 01:03:38,645
She kissed me. I'm the kissee.

846
01:03:38,737 --> 01:03:40,693
You were putting up a big fight.

847
01:03:40,777 --> 01:03:43,245
I tried to stop her,
but she's really strong.

848
01:03:43,337 --> 01:03:45,897
OK, I screwed up.
Can I make it up to you?

849
01:03:45,977 --> 01:03:48,650
Yeah. Why don't you get me a boat?

850
01:03:48,737 --> 01:03:50,409
- What?
- A big boat.

851
01:03:50,497 --> 01:03:52,374
And maybe two big bags of cash.

852
01:03:52,457 --> 01:03:54,334
Then, then, I'll be happy.

853
01:03:54,417 --> 01:03:56,328
Lots of money and lots of stuff!

854
01:03:56,417 --> 01:04:01,013
People want crap like getting married
or having babies with the man they love.

855
01:04:01,097 --> 01:04:03,486
But not me, Bruce.
Just give me the boat.

856
01:04:04,457 --> 01:04:06,732
No wonder you stayed single!

857
01:04:06,817 --> 01:04:10,810
- Don't do this.
- I'm not doing this. I'm undoing it.

858
01:04:10,897 --> 01:04:14,492
I'll be at Debbie's. Take care of Sam
until I make arrangements.

859
01:04:16,217 --> 01:04:18,208
You can't leave me.

860
01:04:19,777 --> 01:04:21,813
I'm the Alpha, lady!

861
01:04:21,897 --> 01:04:24,695
I'm the Omega, baby!

862
01:04:25,217 --> 01:04:27,651
Fine! I don't need you!

863
01:04:33,497 --> 01:04:37,649
What's the matter, Bruce?
She can't handle a little competition?

864
01:04:38,737 --> 01:04:41,012
Game's been called
on account of rain.

865
01:04:56,217 --> 01:05:00,176
An unusually high numberoflottery
winners has officials concerned.

866
01:05:00,257 --> 01:05:02,930
So far, 1, 100 winning tickets
have been turned in,

867
01:05:03,017 --> 01:05:05,850
all, strangely, from the Buffalo area.

868
01:05:06,857 --> 01:05:08,973
More on this story as it develops.

869
01:05:10,057 --> 01:05:11,854
Enjoying your party?

870
01:05:11,937 --> 01:05:15,168
Nothing like spending quality time
with great friends.

871
01:05:16,857 --> 01:05:20,452
- Grace left me.
- Yeah, I know.

872
01:05:20,897 --> 01:05:22,888
She'll take me back.

873
01:05:25,657 --> 01:05:28,615
- She'll take me back, right?
- Would you take you back?

874
01:05:34,817 --> 01:05:38,935
How do you make somebody love you
without affecting free will?

875
01:05:39,017 --> 01:05:41,008
Welcome to my world, son.

876
01:05:41,097 --> 01:05:43,930
You come up with an answer
to that one, you let me know.

877
01:05:54,097 --> 01:05:55,655
Rise and shine, Buffalo.

878
01:05:55,737 --> 01:05:58,729
It's 70 and sunny and the perfect day
to forgive Bruce.

879
01:05:59,537 --> 01:06:01,528
I don't know much

880
01:06:02,657 --> 01:06:06,286
But I know I love you

881
01:06:09,217 --> 01:06:11,208
- Bye.
- Have fun.

882
01:06:35,697 --> 01:06:39,007
- Hi. Can I get a small coffee to go?
- Sure, hon. Just a sec.

883
01:06:39,097 --> 01:06:43,773
K- Tel Records brings you the 100
greatest love songs ofall time.

884

885

You Love, Then Love Bruce",

886
01:06:50,697 --> 01:06:53,086
"Do That To Bruce One More Time".

887
01:06:53,217 --> 01:06:54,809
Who can forget that classic,

888
01:06:54,897 --> 01:06:57,969
"Bruce So H.orny

889
01:06:58,057 --> 01:07:00,810
Order today and we'll throw in
at no extra charge

890
01:07:00,897 --> 01:07:03,013
the video "Sweatin' To Bruce".

891
01:07:03,097 --> 01:07:05,850
Just dial 1-900-FORGIVE H.IM.

892
01:07:05,937 --> 01:07:09,452
That's 1-900-FORGIVE H.IM. Do it now.

893
01:07:36,497 --> 01:07:39,569
No, no! Please don't put that
in your mouth.

894
01:07:39,657 --> 01:07:40,976
That's not food.

895
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:45,130
Go to the bathroom. Wash out your mouth.
Wash off your hands.

896
01:07:45,537 --> 01:07:47,892
That kid is gonna poop an ornament.

897
01:07:47,977 --> 01:07:50,935
One more time,
you're going to be in a lot of trouble.

898
01:07:52,337 --> 01:07:54,328
All right, that's it!

899
01:07:57,337 --> 01:07:59,692
I surrender!

900
01:08:04,817 --> 01:08:06,808
Hi.

901
01:08:10,417 --> 01:08:13,409
I'm... doing my first anchor tonight.

902
01:08:13,497 --> 01:08:16,295
Oh, wow. That's great!

903
01:08:16,377 --> 01:08:20,131
- How have you been doing?
- Good.

904
01:08:21,737 --> 01:08:25,047
- Debbie won the lottery.
- Oh, yeah? You're kidding.

905
01:08:25,137 --> 01:08:31,246
But so did 400,000 other people,
so she only won like $17 or something.

906
01:08:33,217 --> 01:08:35,208
I miss you.

907
01:08:40,017 --> 01:08:41,689
I took a first step.

908
01:08:41,777 --> 01:08:43,768
Jumped out on a ledge.

909
01:08:45,497 --> 01:08:48,295
- Feeling vulnerable.
- What do you want me to say?

910
01:08:48,377 --> 01:08:50,493
Say you want me back.

911
01:08:50,577 --> 01:08:52,807
What about all the signs?

912
01:08:53,097 --> 01:08:57,056
How did you know about that?
Did you talk to Debbie?

913
01:08:57,137 --> 01:09:00,095
Would it help if I just said
I was a complete ass?

914
01:09:00,177 --> 01:09:03,613
- You said ass!
- It's OK if I'm talking about a donkey.

915
01:09:03,697 --> 01:09:06,086
I didn't say "hole". If I said ass...

916
01:09:06,177 --> 01:09:08,896
No, wait. OK, honey, let's go inside.

917
01:09:08,977 --> 01:09:11,889
All right, everybody inside.
Time to go inside.

918
01:09:14,137 --> 01:09:16,890
Please. None of this
seems right without you.

919
01:09:20,857 --> 01:09:22,927
I gotta go.

920
01:09:23,377 --> 01:09:25,015
Wait!

921
01:09:31,097 --> 01:09:33,531
How do you feel now?

922
01:09:35,697 --> 01:09:38,416
Have you completely lost your mind?

923
01:09:38,777 --> 01:09:42,087
- Are you drunk?
- Yeah. Drunk with power.

924
01:09:47,057 --> 01:09:48,695
Love me.

925
01:09:55,737 --> 01:09:57,728
I did.

926
01:10:09,257 --> 01:10:11,248
Yeah, I know. Free will.

927
01:10:12,537 --> 01:10:16,849
More poweroutages reported today
caused by last week's meteorite strike.

928
01:10:16,937 --> 01:10:22,887
Officials are trying to repair transformers
damaged by the ensuing electrical surge.

929
01:10:22,977 --> 01:10:24,808
The scene nearly turned violent

930
01:10:24,897 --> 01:10:29,652
when Buffalo residents protested
last week's lottery results.

931
01:10:29,737 --> 01:10:33,366
Doomsayers are pointing to
last week's strange celestial events

932
01:10:33,457 --> 01:10:38,577
as signs thatprophecy is being fulfilled
and the world may be coming to an end.

933
01:10:40,177 --> 01:10:41,530
The world's gone mad.

934
01:10:41,617 --> 01:10:43,494
- 30 seconds to air.
- OK.

935
01:10:43,577 --> 01:10:46,375
There you are. It's your debut.
How are you feeling?

936
01:10:46,457 --> 01:10:49,494
You know what? I'm fine. Never better.

937
01:10:50,057 --> 01:10:52,048
The show must go on right?

938
01:10:55,017 --> 01:10:58,214
- The Sabres just won the Stanley Cup.
- You're kidding me!

939
01:10:58,817 --> 01:11:01,411
Was that tonight? That's great.

940
01:11:01,497 --> 01:11:05,809
It's crazy out there. We're going to
kick live to Fred at the stadium, OK?

941
01:11:05,897 --> 01:11:08,286
- Five seconds to the open.
- This is it.

942
01:11:08,377 --> 01:11:10,288
- You ready?
- Born that way.

943
01:11:10,377 --> 01:11:15,656
Welcome to Eyewitness News at Six,
with Susan Ortega, Bruce Nolan,

944
01:11:15,737 --> 01:11:18,376
Fred Donohue, sports,
Dallas Coleman, weather.

945
01:11:18,457 --> 01:11:20,368
Now Buffalo's numberone news team.

946
01:11:20,457 --> 01:11:22,448
- I'm Susan Ortega.
- I'm Bruce Nolan.

947
01:11:22,537 --> 01:11:24,528
And here's what's making news.

948
01:11:25,777 --> 01:11:28,245
- What happened?
- We lost power.

949
01:11:28,337 --> 01:11:30,328
- Transformer's down again.
- Jeez.

950
01:11:30,417 --> 01:11:32,851
Ever since that damn meteorite hit.

951
01:11:34,377 --> 01:11:37,130
- We're back.
- We apologise for the interruption.

952
01:11:37,217 --> 01:11:39,333
- Back to the news. Bruce?
- Thank you.

953
01:11:39,417 --> 01:11:42,375
I'm sorry. We're going live
to HSBC Arena,

954
01:11:42,457 --> 01:11:45,449
where the Buffalo Sabres
have won the Stanley Cup.

955
01:11:45,537 --> 01:11:46,856
- Great.
- Fred?

956
01:11:46,937 --> 01:11:49,497
We're about to uncork
some champagne because

957
01:11:49,577 --> 01:11:54,128
the Sabres have won
their first championship in 22 years!

958
01:11:56,537 --> 01:11:57,890
What in blazes...

959
01:11:57,977 --> 01:12:02,493
We'll be back with the Sabres'
victory in just a hot second.

960
01:12:02,577 --> 01:12:04,329
In other news...

961
01:12:04,417 --> 01:12:06,885
- Bloody hell!
- What is it now?

962
01:12:06,977 --> 01:12:08,968
- The whole booth is down.
- It's not!

963
01:12:09,537 --> 01:12:14,770
In other news, fighting erupted
in the Gaza Strip today,

964
01:12:14,857 --> 01:12:16,893
as Israelis and Palestinians...

965
01:12:16,977 --> 01:12:18,330
- Bruce.
- What?

966
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:21,614
We've got a situation here.
They're rioting right outside.

967
01:12:21,697 --> 01:12:24,416
- You're kidding.
- The whole town has gone crazy.

968
01:12:29,257 --> 01:12:31,134
Go on, Bruce. Say something.

969
01:12:32,257 --> 01:12:35,454
Ladies and gentlemen, this just in.

970
01:12:36,177 --> 01:12:41,410
Possibly the biggest breaking news
story this town has ever seen.

971
01:12:48,337 --> 01:12:50,328
And I gotta go.

972
01:12:51,137 --> 01:12:53,128
Sorry, Jack.

973
01:12:53,617 --> 01:12:55,972
Susan, it's all yours.

974
01:12:59,177 --> 01:13:01,247
Sabres!

975
01:13:01,337 --> 01:13:03,487
Sabres rule!

976
01:13:03,577 --> 01:13:05,886
Down with the lottery!

977
01:13:05,977 --> 01:13:08,127
Repent! The end is near!

978
01:13:21,777 --> 01:13:23,608
The lottery sucks!

979
01:13:23,977 --> 01:13:25,888
I only won 17 bucks!

980
01:13:28,097 --> 01:13:30,088
Channel 7 lies!

981
01:13:31,817 --> 01:13:33,694
Oh, no!

982
01:13:45,097 --> 01:13:47,611
God!

983
01:13:49,697 --> 01:13:51,688
God?

984
01:13:52,457 --> 01:13:54,448
Are you here?

985
01:13:57,057 --> 01:13:59,571
Hello? I need your help!

986
01:14:00,057 --> 01:14:02,810
Clap on!

987
01:14:10,377 --> 01:14:12,368
Figures!

988
01:14:15,377 --> 01:14:17,845
Well, hello there, Bruce Almighty.

989
01:14:20,897 --> 01:14:24,651
Not as easy as it looks, is it, son?
This God business.

990
01:14:25,617 --> 01:14:28,085
They're all out of control.

991
01:14:28,177 --> 01:14:30,247
It's me. I don't know what to do.

992
01:14:30,777 --> 01:14:33,245
Well, you're right on time.
Seven o'clock.

993
01:14:36,497 --> 01:14:38,488
The 7th at 7.00.

994
01:14:52,497 --> 01:14:54,488
All righty, then.

995
01:14:56,777 --> 01:14:59,610
- There we are.
- It's good.

996
01:15:01,817 --> 01:15:03,375
It's a wonderful thing.

997
01:15:03,457 --> 01:15:08,247
No matter how filthy something gets,
you can always clean it right up.

998
01:15:09,137 --> 01:15:12,447
There were so many.
I just gave them all what they wanted.

999
01:15:12,537 --> 01:15:14,129
Yeah.

1000
01:15:14,697 --> 01:15:18,007
But since when does anyone
have a clue about what they want?

1001
01:15:20,857 --> 01:15:23,246
So what do I do?

1002
01:15:25,777 --> 01:15:29,895
Parting your soup is not a miracle.
It's a magic trick.

1003
01:15:30,657 --> 01:15:33,125
A single mom who's working two jobs

1004
01:15:33,217 --> 01:15:37,096
and still finds time to take her kid
to soccer practice, that's a miracle.

1005
01:15:37,497 --> 01:15:40,807
A teenager who says no to drugs
and yes to an education,

1006
01:15:41,657 --> 01:15:43,648
that's a miracle.

1007
01:15:44,417 --> 01:15:46,692
People want me to do everything for them.

1008
01:15:46,777 --> 01:15:49,735
What they don't realise
is they have the power.

1009
01:15:51,017 --> 01:15:53,611
You want to see a miracle, son?

1010
01:15:53,697 --> 01:15:55,688
Be the miracle.

1011
01:15:58,897 --> 01:16:00,888
Wait. Are you leaving?

1012
01:16:01,537 --> 01:16:04,210
Yeah. I figure you can handle things now.

1013
01:16:04,297 --> 01:16:06,970
But what if I need you?
What if I have questions?

1014
01:16:07,057 --> 01:16:09,366
That's your problem, Bruce.

1015
01:16:09,457 --> 01:16:11,413
That's everybody's problem.

1016
01:16:11,497 --> 01:16:13,488
You keep looking up.

1017
01:16:17,177 --> 01:16:21,216
Orderhas been restored
after this evening's downtown riot.

1018
01:16:21,297 --> 01:16:23,970
State officials
have suspended all lottery sales

1019
01:16:24,057 --> 01:16:26,013
pending furtherinvestigation.

1020
01:16:26,097 --> 01:16:30,568
No injuries were reported in the melee,
however there were dozens ofarrests.

1021
01:17:16,617 --> 01:17:18,209
OK.

1022
01:17:19,497 --> 01:17:21,408
- Thanks a million.
- Not a problem.

1023
01:17:21,497 --> 01:17:23,488
God bless.

1024
01:17:28,017 --> 01:17:32,010
Bruce giveth and Bruce... taketh away.

1025
01:17:32,097 --> 01:17:34,657
If you don't like it... mega-bite me.

1026
01:17:42,817 --> 01:17:44,967
- Evan?
- Bruce.

1027
01:17:47,937 --> 01:17:52,806
I suppose you're here to gloat about
the anchor position. Go ahead.

1028
01:17:52,897 --> 01:17:54,888
Well, actually, I...

1029
01:17:56,097 --> 01:17:59,294
I just came to tell you
that I've been a royal prick.

1030
01:17:59,377 --> 01:18:02,096
The anchor position is yours.
I turned down the job.

1031
01:18:02,937 --> 01:18:05,246
And I never really congratulated you.

1032
01:18:06,937 --> 01:18:08,928
Congratulations.

1033
01:18:11,137 --> 01:18:12,695
Thanks, Bruce.

1034
01:18:12,777 --> 01:18:15,655
In the financial world,
things are back to normal

1035
01:18:15,737 --> 01:18:18,809
in what analysts are calling
a fluke market fluctuation.

1036
01:18:18,897 --> 01:18:21,457
- You made the right move.
- What about you?

1037
01:18:21,537 --> 01:18:23,653
You ready to go back out there?

1038
01:18:24,657 --> 01:18:27,376
Do the cutesy stuff?
The lighter side of the news?

1039
01:18:27,457 --> 01:18:31,132
Lower and debase myself
for the amusement of strangers?

1040
01:18:31,217 --> 01:18:33,492
Yeah, I could do that.
Sounds like fun.

1041
01:18:33,577 --> 01:18:35,135
Good.

1042
01:18:35,817 --> 01:18:39,048
OK, Sammy, let's do it right.
Like all the other dogs.

1043
01:18:39,137 --> 01:18:42,652
I don't want to make you feel bad,
but they're laughing at you, pal.

1044
01:18:42,737 --> 01:18:44,853
Come on. Concentrate.

1045
01:18:44,937 --> 01:18:47,087
Pump it out, if you have to.

1046
01:18:47,177 --> 01:18:49,566
What am I going to do with you?

1047
01:18:51,777 --> 01:18:54,575
I know this seems kind of crazy,

1048
01:18:54,657 --> 01:18:58,616
but desperate times
call for desperate measures.

1049
01:19:00,857 --> 01:19:03,451
OK, Sammy. Do your thing.

1050
01:19:04,297 --> 01:19:07,255
That's it. Good boy!

1051
01:19:09,457 --> 01:19:11,175
Training my dog.

1052
01:19:30,057 --> 01:19:33,129
Yes! We did it!

1053
01:19:35,657 --> 01:19:38,888
We're doing it doggy style

1054
01:19:40,217 --> 01:19:42,412
I'll alert Penthouse Forum.

1055
01:19:42,497 --> 01:19:44,488
Hi, Deb. How are you?

1056
01:19:45,297 --> 01:19:46,616
How's Grace?

1057
01:19:46,697 --> 01:19:49,416
I didn't come to chat.
I came for Grace's stuff.

1058
01:19:55,577 --> 01:19:58,296
- You need a...?
- That's OK. I've got it.

1059
01:20:05,177 --> 01:20:07,008
I don't know if she...

1060
01:20:07,097 --> 01:20:09,486
I don't know
if she wants that or not.

1061
01:20:13,337 --> 01:20:16,329
This is full. You did all this?

1062
01:20:26,737 --> 01:20:29,046
You know what I do before I go to bed?

1063
01:20:29,137 --> 01:20:32,812
I tuck my kids in, maybe have
some ice cream and watch Conan.

1064
01:20:34,577 --> 01:20:36,568
Know what Grace does?

1065
01:20:37,737 --> 01:20:39,728
She prays.

1066
01:20:40,857 --> 01:20:42,609
Most of the time for you.

1067
01:21:03,697 --> 01:21:06,928
Find Grace Connelly.

1068
01:21:09,657 --> 01:21:11,648
The woman does pray a lot.

1069
01:21:13,617 --> 01:21:16,211
Find... Grace and Bruce.

1070
01:21:17,337 --> 01:21:19,646
"Dear God,
please help Bruce find himself,

1071
01:21:19,737 --> 01:21:21,693
find contentment, find you. "

1072
01:21:21,777 --> 01:21:25,213
"Dear God, please help Bruce.
He seems to be struggling. "

1073
01:21:25,297 --> 01:21:27,253
"Dear God, give Bruce strength. "

1074
01:21:27,337 --> 01:21:29,055
"Dear God, bless Bruce. "

1075
01:21:33,737 --> 01:21:35,568
It's her.

1076
01:21:36,137 --> 01:21:39,288
Sammy, she's logging on.
She's praying right now.

1077
01:21:46,297 --> 01:21:48,015
Please, God.

1078
01:21:49,577 --> 01:21:50,896
Please.

1079
01:21:50,977 --> 01:21:52,933
I still love him.

1080
01:21:55,257 --> 01:21:58,135
But I don't want to love him any more.

1081
01:21:58,217 --> 01:22:00,606
I don't want to hurt any more. Please.

1082
01:22:01,217 --> 01:22:03,208
Help me forget.

1083
01:22:03,937 --> 01:22:05,928
Please help me to let it go.

1084
01:22:07,057 --> 01:22:09,287
Please help me let him go.

1085
01:22:29,537 --> 01:22:31,528
You win!

1086
01:22:32,217 --> 01:22:34,014
I'm done!

1087
01:22:34,097 --> 01:22:37,772
Please! I don't want to do this any more!

1088
01:22:38,697 --> 01:22:40,688
I don't want to be God.

1089
01:22:41,297 --> 01:22:44,653
I want you to decide
what's right for me!

1090
01:22:44,737 --> 01:22:47,456
I surrender to your will!

1091
01:23:16,497 --> 01:23:17,816
Am I...?

1092
01:23:17,897 --> 01:23:21,731
You can't kneel down in the middle
of a highway and live to talk about it.

1093
01:23:21,817 --> 01:23:23,808
But why?

1094
01:23:25,017 --> 01:23:26,609
Why now?

1095
01:23:26,697 --> 01:23:28,289
Bruce...

1096
01:23:29,177 --> 01:23:31,896
you have the divine spark.

1097
01:23:31,977 --> 01:23:35,765
You have the gift for bringing joy
and laughter to the world.

1098
01:23:36,857 --> 01:23:38,848
I know. I created you.

1099
01:23:40,217 --> 01:23:42,492
- Quit bragging.
- See?

1100
01:23:42,577 --> 01:23:44,772
That's what I'm talking about.

1101
01:23:44,857 --> 01:23:46,848
That's the spark.

1102
01:23:51,497 --> 01:23:53,613
What do you want me to do?

1103
01:23:54,577 --> 01:23:56,408
I want you to pray, son.

1104
01:23:56,897 --> 01:24:00,014
Go ahead. Use them.

1105
01:24:05,577 --> 01:24:08,614
Lord, feed the hungry.

1106
01:24:08,697 --> 01:24:11,973
And bring peace to...

1107
01:24:13,417 --> 01:24:15,408
all of mankind.

1108
01:24:17,377 --> 01:24:19,572
- How's that?
- Great.

1109
01:24:19,657 --> 01:24:22,330
If you want to be Miss America.

1110
01:24:22,417 --> 01:24:25,853
Now, come on.
What do you really care about?

1111
01:24:30,177 --> 01:24:32,452
Grace.

1112
01:24:35,217 --> 01:24:37,208
You want her back?

1113
01:24:41,457 --> 01:24:43,448
No.

1114
01:24:44,537 --> 01:24:46,528
I want her to be happy.

1115
01:24:48,777 --> 01:24:51,132
No matter what that means.

1116
01:24:51,217 --> 01:24:53,412
I want her to find someone

1117
01:24:53,497 --> 01:24:55,488
who'll treat her

1118
01:24:56,377 --> 01:25:00,973
with all the love she deserved from me.

1119
01:25:03,497 --> 01:25:05,488
I want her to meet someone

1120
01:25:10,577 --> 01:25:12,568
who'll see her always

1121
01:25:13,697 --> 01:25:15,688
as I do now.

1122
01:25:20,137 --> 01:25:22,253
Through your eyes.

1123
01:25:22,857 --> 01:25:25,530
- Now that's a prayer.
- Yeah?

1124
01:25:26,577 --> 01:25:29,887
Yeah. It's good.

1125
01:25:34,897 --> 01:25:37,013
I'm going to get right on it.

1126
01:25:37,817 --> 01:25:39,694
Clear!

1127
01:25:39,777 --> 01:25:42,132
That didn't feel very good.

1128
01:25:43,057 --> 01:25:45,810
- Got a rhythm.
- I got a pulse.

1129
01:25:45,897 --> 01:25:48,855
- Let's get him up.
- Get the backboard and brace.

1130
01:25:59,057 --> 01:26:01,013
Welcome back.

1131
01:26:01,097 --> 01:26:03,213
You're lucky to be alive, son.

1132
01:26:03,297 --> 01:26:05,288
Someone up there must like you.

1133
01:26:19,977 --> 01:26:24,095
I hear all that stuff winds up
in a warehouse somewhere.

1134
01:26:29,657 --> 01:26:31,648
Hi, baby.

1135
01:26:33,417 --> 01:26:36,966
Oh, my God, look at you.

1136
01:26:37,377 --> 01:26:40,335
- I was such an idiot.
- It's OK.

1137
01:26:47,377 --> 01:26:50,130
I don't know what I would have done.

1138
01:26:50,937 --> 01:26:55,328
Oh, God. I swear I wanted
to be mad at you forever.

1139
01:27:06,777 --> 01:27:08,768
Now you're just showing off.

1140
01:27:19,817 --> 01:27:23,696
This is Bruce Nolan here at Buffalo's
first "Be the Miracle" blood drive.

1141
01:27:23,777 --> 01:27:26,575
It's a B-E-A-utiful day.

1142
01:27:26,657 --> 01:27:29,933
So come on down,
because the life you save could be mine.

1143
01:27:30,337 --> 01:27:35,092
Let's go over here. The Kowolskis have
baked a cookie just for this occasion.

1144
01:27:35,177 --> 01:27:38,169
Sure it's a creepy and a shameless plug,
but we love 'em.

1145
01:27:38,257 --> 01:27:40,373
Thank you, Mama. Vol - finger, nose.

1146
01:27:42,337 --> 01:27:44,567
I will have given blood
twice this week.

1147
01:27:44,657 --> 01:27:46,852
For those of you who haven't heard,

1148
01:27:46,937 --> 01:27:50,407
I'd like to introduce you
to the future Mrs Exclusive.

1149
01:27:50,497 --> 01:27:53,534
Grace Connelly. There she is.

1150
01:27:53,617 --> 01:27:56,927
Look at her! Isn't she beautiful?

1151
01:27:58,057 --> 01:28:01,970
She just gave blood and she still
has enough left to fill up her face.

1152
01:28:02,057 --> 01:28:05,811
Yes, behind every great man,
there's a woman rolling her eyes, folks.

1153
01:28:05,897 --> 01:28:10,288
I'm Bruce Nolan for Eyewitness News
reminding you to...

1154
01:28:10,377 --> 01:28:13,210
Be the miracle!

1155
01:28:14,097 --> 01:28:15,530
You heard 'em.

1156
01:28:15,617 --> 01:28:18,768
- OK, cut it. Thank you, Bruce.
- Thanks, Ally.

1157
01:28:21,977 --> 01:28:25,287
- How was that?
- Great. That was really great.

1158
01:28:25,377 --> 01:28:27,686
Now go over there.
The nurse is waiting.

1159
01:28:27,777 --> 01:28:29,972
- Do I have to?
- Oh, it's not going to hurt.

1160
01:28:30,057 --> 01:28:32,446
In fact, I think you'll find it pleasurable.

1161
01:28:32,817 --> 01:28:34,535
Baby.

1162
01:29:29,337 --> 01:29:34,252
Who can take a rainbow,
wrap it in a sock

1163
01:29:34,337 --> 01:29:39,491
Soak it in the sun
and make a groovy lemon pie?

1164
01:29:45,217 --> 01:29:47,253
Oh, Jesus.

1165
01:29:48,497 --> 01:29:49,612
I'm sorry.

1166
01:29:49,697 --> 01:29:53,576
I'm a very rare blood type. I'm AB positive.

1167
01:29:54,457 --> 01:29:56,448
Sounds delicious.

1168
01:29:59,177 --> 01:30:01,930
Well, there are storehouses
all over the world

1169
01:30:02,017 --> 01:30:05,407
with tons of stuff on ice, and...

1170
01:30:06,257 --> 01:30:08,896
- Sorry.
- You were like this. Sorry, go on.

1171
01:30:10,657 --> 01:30:12,852
Positive, IB positive... Sorry.

1172
01:30:12,937 --> 01:30:14,928
I have a rary...

1173
01:30:16,497 --> 01:30:18,488
She has a rary!

1174
01:30:18,577 --> 01:30:20,932
I have a very rare blood type.

1175
01:30:21,017 --> 01:30:22,575
I'm AB negative.

1176
01:30:22,657 --> 01:30:24,648
- I'm IB positive.
- Am I AB negative?

1177
01:30:24,737 --> 01:30:26,773
I don't know what you are any more.

1178
01:30:27,217 --> 01:30:30,926
I'm going to need a frickin' miracle
to get to work on time.

1179
01:30:52,697 --> 01:30:54,494
That'll work.

1180
01:30:54,577 --> 01:30:58,411
Other stories in the...

1181
01:31:02,097 --> 01:31:05,407
The prime minister of Sweden
visited Washington today,

1182
01:31:05,497 --> 01:31:08,807
and in other...

1183
01:31:10,377 --> 01:31:12,413
In other...

1184
01:31:13,617 --> 01:31:15,608
In other news...

1185
01:31:19,577 --> 01:31:21,966
I'm Bruce Nolan for Eyewitness No...

1186
01:31:24,417 --> 01:31:26,408
Eyewitness Nose.

1187
01:31:27,057 --> 01:31:29,048
And clear!

1188
01:31:29,537 --> 01:31:31,528
Be the miracle!

1189
01:31:31,617 --> 01:31:33,608
That's right!
