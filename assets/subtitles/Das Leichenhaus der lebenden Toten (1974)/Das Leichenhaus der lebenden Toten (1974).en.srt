1
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:30,852
Sorry. How much?
Three pounds, please.

2
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,233
Thank you.

3
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,319
Give us a fill-up.

4
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:06,138
I'm so sorry.
I must be a little tired.

5
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:08,932
I put it into reverse.

6
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,018
Yes, I can see that.

7
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:14,354
Ofcourse I'm insured.
And whatever expense-

8
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:17,733
Ofcourse, darling.
After all, it could have been worse.

9
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,068
Couldn't it?
Yes.

10
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:24,239
There's even a garage.
How long will it take?

11
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,241
Well, you'll need a new wheel.

12
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,660
We'll have to get that
from Glasgow.
And it's the weekend.

13
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:31,413
Earliest will be Monday evening.

14
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,753
Okay, it's yours.

15
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:46,261
I'll see you on Monday then.
And don't bugger me about.

16
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,180
Are you going to Windermere?

17
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,515
Not into the town exactly.
Nearby.

18
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,269
Well, you'll take me there
just the same, won't you?
It's the least you could do.

19
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,563
Right?

20
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,315
I'll drive.

21
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,613
I mean, we don't want to go
all the way in reverse, do we?

22
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,866
Actually, you'll be doing me
a favor.

23
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,912
You see, I've driven
all the way from London
and I do feel a little tired.

24
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,831
Then go to sleep.

25
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,803
Thank you.

26
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:32,974
Aren't you taking
a lot for granted?

27
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,893
Look, darling,
you don't have to worry.

28
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:38,230
I mean, I'm not gonna
jump you or something.

29
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:40,315
The name's George.

30
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:46,154
And I'm Edna Simmon.

31
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:51,701
Hmm. You look a little
like an Edna.

32
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,496
You up from London
for the weekend?

33
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:59,376
More or less. My sister
has a cottage near here
at Southgate.

34
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,336
Hmm.

35
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,715
It is a warning against hysteria
when confronted by ecological problems,

36
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,551
many ofwhich have been
exaggerated.

37
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:10,846
And this so-called
Project for Survival
by Goldsmith and Allen...

38
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:15,809
has been signed by 33 English scientists,
among them Julian Huxley.

39
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:20,772
What rot.
Ecological problems exaggerated.

40
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:25,485
You know, ofcourse,
when we all die,
only the scientists will survive.

41
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:36,538
Oh, charming.

42
00:07:55,808 --> 00:08:00,145
What's so important
about Windermere?
A girl?

43
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:03,148
Beautiful country,
low industry...

44
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:06,568
and an isolated little house
all mine...

45
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,446
where from Saturday to Monday
I'll listen to the grass grow.

46
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,364
Very restful.

47
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,876
Stop!

48
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,295
Please.

49
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:28,006
Listen. I must be
in Southgate this evening.

50
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,509
And if I take you to Windermere,
I'll be late.

51
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:35,263
What's so important
about Southgate?
A man?

52
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,057
Oh, no.

53
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:41,436
I have to see my sister before-
Before what?

54
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,190
Look, I have a suggestion.

55
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:49,152
Take me there.
Keep the car to go to Windermere
and I'll send someone for it.

56
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,947
Then I'll be late.
Look, the house is new.

57
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:56,326
And I have an appointment
with some friends to fix it up-
Oh, please!

58
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:01,456
Okay. Show me the way.

59
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,592
I've only been there once.

60
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:57,512
I remember a stream,
but all these country roads
look alike.

61
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:05,270
Well, there's a stream all right,
but the road ends here.

62
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,610
Hang on a sec.
I'll go and ask.

63
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,865
Hey, what are you doing
with the key? Why?

64
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:22,203
Not that I don't trust you,
but I really can't risk your
leaving me here on foot, can I?

65
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,998
Don't get your knickers
in a twist. I'll be back soon.

66
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,043
George!

67
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,878
Ask for the Madison's house.

68
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,192
Hello? Anyone around?

69
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:12,313
There. For the prescribed area,
keep it on an emission
of 17 megahertz. Try it.

70
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,942
Right.

71
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:18,027
Ta very much.

72
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:24,743
Excuse me.
The road to the Madison's place?

73
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,703
Hang on a second.
I'll show you.

74
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:30,039
Now, before you lower it,
I'll just adjust the cycle convergence.
All right.

75
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,876
Okay, sir,
let's give it a whirl.
What is this thing?

76
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,254
It's supposed to destroy
insects and parasites.

77
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,882
It was sent by
the Department of Agriculture.

78
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:43,428
It's still experimental.
I'd send it right back
where it came from...

79
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:46,473
and keep the insects
and parasites
nature's given you.

80
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,558
What are you talking about?
Like that?

81
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,643
Just another machine
to pollute the earth.

82
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:53,021
Till now, at least,
this part ofthe country's
been left alone.

83
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,023
What do you mean,
"pollute the earth"?

84
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,567
We're here to demonstrate
to the growersjust the opposite.

85
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:59,819
And they're all agreed.
I've got their signatures
here in me pocket.

86
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,614
This works solely
by ultrasonic radiation.

87
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,616
There's not a chemical involved.

88
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,619
You're quite right, sir.

89
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:10,872
If you don't like progress,
those two's the wrong two
to talk to.

90
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,333
Now where was it
you wanted to go to?
Oh, the Madison place.

91
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,960
You go over that hill and
on the right there's a big oak.

92
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:19,881
Then you follow the old ridge
and it's the first, second-
No, the third gate-

93
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:23,927
Come along with it, fella.
I'm used to traffic lights.
Let's have it over again.

94
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:26,638
Oh, all right.
Up from London, are ya?
I should've known.

95
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:29,349
Don't see too many young fellas
dressed like you round here.

96
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:32,977
Anyway, if you hang on,
I'll go and put this thing down.

97
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:37,106
All right, Bernard, let's have another
bash at the main rotator. - Right.

98
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:42,070
Well?

99
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,697
No, nothing yet.

100
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,658
Hey, you did it.

101
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:31,012
Go back along the road
on to the side ofthe river.

102
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,056
I'm sure you know a river
when you see one.

103
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,016
George!

104
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,018
George! George!

105
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:40,438
That man, he's following me!
He tried to attack me!

106
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,662
Sorry, love,
but I can't see anyone.

107
00:15:55,746 --> 00:16:00,124
No, there was someone there.
Back there. He was horrible!

108
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,543
Are you certain?

109
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:06,756
He was very tall
w-w-with black hair
and a black suit.

110
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:11,094
And-And his clothes were wet
as if- as if he'd just come out
ofthe water.

111
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:13,012
You're wet too.

112
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:16,391
I f ell into the water
when I was running away.
Don't be fright.

113
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,518
Must have been Guthrie,
the loony.

114
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,521
Who's that then?
No, I were only joking.

115
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:24,315
Old Guthrie's dead.
He were a tramp.

116
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,317
He used to sleep down there
by the river.

117
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:30,196
And then about a week ago
he drownded hisself. It seems
to have been a suicide.

118
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,198
And now he's a ghost.

119
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:35,952
I'm sure he wanted to kill me.
He tried to get into the car!

120
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,830
It must have been another tramp
trying to get some money out of you.

121
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:42,375
Old Guthrie used to do that, too,
to every car that come along, eh?

122
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:47,797
Come on now, darling.
You were sitting there all alone
and he frightened you. That's all.

123
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:50,425
No.
It was getting dark. More natural.

124
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:55,555
Come on. I found out how
to get to your sister's house.
Thank you.

125
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:56,973
Bye.

126
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,702
Katie?

127
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,301
Strawberries, Martin.

128
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:01,556
I wanted to bake a pie
to celebrate my sister's visit.

129
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,606
Finished, are you?
Can I go now?

130
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,153
It's hard for me too.

131
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,530
You must understand, Katie.

132
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,992
I know you're making that
impossible for me.

133
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:24,537
First you keep me here,
like a prisoner, for a year.

134
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:28,833
And now, I know why
you asked my sister
to come here.

135
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,002
You didn't think I did, huh?

136
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:33,004
I know where you want
to send me.

137
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:37,258
But I'll never go there!
Do you hear me? Never!

138
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,667
We'll do what you want.

139
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:15,129
Now please get hold of yourself.
Come on, darling.

140
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,883
I'm going to set up the camera
and flashes for the last series
of pictures.

141
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,636
Come straight back.

142
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,055
Will you be all right alone?

143
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,140
Will you be all right?

144
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,953
Do you believe that,
about the tramp, or-

145
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,831
Or what?
Or what I told you?

146
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:54,001
I'm not mad, you know.
I-I don't imagine things.

147
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,255
Methinks the lady
doth protest too much.

148
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,633
What? I resent that.

149
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:04,762
Listen, love, you have already
ruined enough of my day.

150
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:08,140
Do you wanna fight now?

151
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,768
Jesus. You made me lose the way.

152
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:14,105
Now, how in the hell am I going
to find this bloody place?

153
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,176
Is that you, Martin?

154
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:11,824
Martin! Martin!

155
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:14,577
Martin!

156
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,706
Martin!

157
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,091
Martin! Martin!

158
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,155
Help me, Martin!

159
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,741
Help!

160
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:57,995
Help! Help!

161
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:00,289
Katie!

162
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:45,626
Katie! Katie, what happened?

163
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:49,630
What happened?
Where's Martin?
There, by the stream.

164
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,840
It's all right.

165
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:55,302
It's all right.

166
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:08,732
Never seen anything like it.
Somebody certainly enjoyed
themselves here.

167
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:11,193
A sadist, huh?
Or a lunatic.

168
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,279
And enormously strong.

169
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:16,824
His whole torso's been caved in.
Every bone smashed.

170
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:25,291
Have you notified headquarters yet?
Yes, Sarge, but they're
awfully busy this morning.

171
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,459
Can't send anyone
before teatime.

172
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:31,547
Button up, man.
You're wearing a uniform,
not a pair of pajamas.

173
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,680
Now look here, Sergeant.
I've got other things to do.

174
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:43,892
You can't keep me here all day.
I've told you, I've got nothing
to do with this.

175
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:48,439
When there's been a murder,
it's a funny thing, you know,
but nobody ever has anything to do with it.

176
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:53,444
I tell you,
I didn't even know the man.
I'm here by chance!

177
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:55,821
Continue the interrogation,
Benson.

178
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:59,658
Maybe we can find out
what "chance" means.
All right, yes.

179
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:23,265
No one's seen or heard anything?
Any witnesses? Anything to go on?

180
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,309
No. It was foggy,
Sergeant.

181
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:30,648
Um, but we've been told-
Well, there's this farmer who
lives about a mile f rom here,

182
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:35,611
and he says there was bad blood
between the husband and wife.

183
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:38,697
A couple of times
he saw 'em fighting.

184
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:42,993
Bring him in for questionin'.
Yes, Sergeant.

185
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:01,595
Well?

186
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,766
She's very consistent.
She insists it was a man
dressed in black.

187
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,768
Very tall and well built.

188
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:10,521
It was the same man
who tried to attack me.
I saw him.

189
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:13,357
Yes, and you're
the only ones.

190
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:17,194
But ofcourse I saw him.
Why would I invent
such a thing?

191
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:20,280
Why? It's very simple, miss.

192
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:23,867
To back up your sister's story.
That's why.

193
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:31,458
Come on. Everything's
going to be all right.

194
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:45,180
Come on, dear. Drink your tea.

195
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,224
It'll do you good.

196
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:53,439
Everything will be all right.
Come on now. Drink up.

197
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,527
Nothing to be frightened of.

198
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:06,118
Now, Mrs. West, you were alone
when your husband was killed.

199
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:09,163
It wasn't the first time
you had a fight, was it?

200
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,959
Could you tell us what these pictures
are all about?

201
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:15,753
I don't know.
I can't remember.

202
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:18,213
But how- how can you think-

203
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:21,842
You saw what happened to Martin.
Only a very strong man could-

204
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:35,230
Heroin.

205
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:41,945
Now, Miss Simon, you must be aware
that under the influence ofdrugs,

206
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,657
an individual can do things
that otherwise are beyond...

207
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,951
the reach of  his normal powers,

208
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:50,829
and perhaps not even remember
what he's done.

209
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:57,544
Just as your sister here
doesn't seem to remember anything
about these photographs.

210
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:02,257
You took a shot last night, didn't you?
Come on. Admit it!

211
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,301
But this is monstrous.

212
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:08,514
What possible motive could Katie
have had to want to kill Martin?

213
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:12,559
Because after having kept her here
for a year to get her offthe stuff,

214
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:17,564
and after becoming aware
that she was still an addict,

215
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:21,360
Martin decided to put her
into a clinic.

216
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,865
- Isn't that why you
came down here from London?
- Yes, that's true, but-

217
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,827
- And you didn't want to go, did you?
- No, I didn't want to go!

218
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:33,622
In hospital, you wouldn't have been able
to get any ofthis lovely stuff-

219
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:36,625
- But I didn't kill him! I didn't!
- Excuse me, uh-

220
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:41,171
- What is it?
- Sorry, but he says he's got
something very important to tell you.

221
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:44,424
It's about time.
Let's hear it.

222
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,802
You can come in.
Thanks.

223
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:53,433
Well, it's like this, see?
I came up here yesterday
to see my friends.

224
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,519
Well?

225
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,982
Well, can't you see?
I've got nothing to do with this.

226
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:03,944
I've got my house to look after.
Will you tell him-
Listen, boy.

227
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:08,323
You keep getting on my nerves,
and I'm gonna give you another
kind of house to look after,

228
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,534
one with lots of  bars
in the windows!

229
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:13,287
All right, all right!

230
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:15,372
Take it easy.

231
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,708
Don't get hysterical.

232
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:20,127
We'll pick this up again later.

233
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:23,422
I'm finished with you.
And with you too, miss.

234
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:26,341
For the moment.
Don't worry, Katie.

235
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:30,220
There's a hotel in Southgate.
You can both book rooms there
until you hear from me.

236
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,306
But I want to stay with my sister.

237
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,100
Sorry, miss.
You must stay in the hotel.

238
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:43,692
There must be a way
to get her out of this.

239
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:47,571
Yeah, a good London barrister.
You think the police are right?

240
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:49,990
Never, especially not him.

241
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,159
The camera. Ofcourse.

242
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:56,413
Katie said that as she was
being followed, the camera
was taking pictures.

243
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:58,874
There may be a photograph
ofthe man.

244
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,502
Come on.
Let's tell the sergeant.
Wait.

245
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,088
You see that cop by the Mini?

246
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,924
Yes.

247
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:09,259
Ask him for a light.

248
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:10,844
Why?
Go on!

249
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,930
I'm gonna do that
bloody Irishman.

250
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,435
Excuse me.
Do you have a light?

251
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:20,437
No, I'm sorry, miss.
Never carry matches.

252
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:24,024
Haven't smoked in years,
you know. Worst luck.
What do you mean?

253
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:29,446
Well, miss, you see, when I smoked,
I was as thin as a rail. But now, well-

254
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:33,742
You could always start up again.
I might do that one day.

255
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:36,286
I wish I could stop smoking.
Thanks anyway.

256
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,372
You're welcome, miss.

257
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:43,418
Would you mind telling me
what you're up to?
Better we have it developed ourselves.

258
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:46,254
Why?
A little imbroglio, darling.

259
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:49,049
The cops never like
to admit they're wrong.

260
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,726
Craig.
Yes, Sergeant.

261
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:28,088
It's going to take ages, isn't it?
Nope. He does them himself.

262
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:32,467
He said they'll be ready by noon.
I've asked him to blow 'em up too.

263
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:37,305
For a man in love with solitude,
which you say you are, this does
look like the perfect place.

264
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:41,560
Wouldn't you agree?
Do me a favor, darling.
Don't try to be funny, all right?

265
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:44,271
We're in this mess together,
aren't we?

266
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,457
Good morning.

267
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,171
It won't bite.
You see, it's trained.
Can I help you?

268
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:13,467
Have you got any rooms?
Would you go
into the bar, please?

269
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:29,524
Got two rooms?
I guess that must cost less
than a double, right?

270
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,985
What do you mean by that?
Nothing.

271
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,697
It'sjust that we need
the rooms to rest in,
nothing more.

272
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:38,867
This is a respectable place,
I'll have you know.

273
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,786
Yes, yes, I can tell.

274
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:44,206
I intend to spend
as little time in it as possible.

275
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:48,251
Where can I make a phone call?
Out there, under the stairs.

276
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:09,523
You wouldn't be the people
involved in the murder,
would you?

277
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,775
Why?

278
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:14,069
Message foryou.

279
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:22,661
Yes, I know I was supposed
to arrive yesterday, but I've
been delayed by an accident.

280
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:25,413
And I'm here
just a few miles away.

281
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:29,126
Anyway, wait for me,
and I'll be there as soon as I can.

282
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,503
Ofcourse I'll be there.

283
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:34,047
Just a few things to finish up.
Okay?

284
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:37,634
- George. George!
- I gotta go. Bye.

285
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:40,887
Katie's had a breakdown.
The policejust phoned.

286
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:44,266
They're putting her
in the local hospital.
Listen, we must go there.

287
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:48,270
But I've got things to do.
I'vejust-
Please, I can't even think anymore.

288
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:50,355
You must help me.

289
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:08,391
I'm Mrs. West's sister.
Is it serious, Doctor?

290
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:11,519
No. She's coming
round now.

291
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:14,689
Oh, she needs rest.
Please, don't tire her.

292
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,993
I didn't do it, Edna.

293
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:52,102
Want one? They're perfect
for the long voyage home.

294
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:54,813
No, thank you.

295
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:57,899
What do you mean
by "the long voyage home"?

296
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,193
A touch of inside humor,
I'm afraid.

297
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,570
A little macabre, I know.

298
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:07,659
You see, from here to Manchester,
it's quite a way to go
in a f reezer unit.

299
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:11,579
Yes, all the autopsies
and examinations and tests
on various organs...

300
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:13,581
are done in Manchester.

301
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:17,502
Quite a few people
leave their bodies
to science these days.

302
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:20,463
How about it, young man?

303
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:23,341
Shall I make a reservation for you?

304
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:26,094
Oh, no.
It's the nursery again.

305
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:32,642
NurseJones! NurseJones!

306
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:35,478
Quick, look after her,
will you?

307
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:38,148
NurseJones.
My God, where is everyone?

308
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:41,609
My God. My God. The babies!

309
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:44,696
Oh, my goodness.
What a nasty looking cut.

310
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,781
Come along with me, Nurse.

311
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:55,915
Well, here, you can help.
All right, Doctor.

312
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,917
Will you hold it still?

313
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:19,105
It's happened again.

314
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,793
Are you hurt?
No, but it tried its hardest.

315
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:42,629
Hmm.
What the hell
is wrong with it?

316
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,547
We don't know.

317
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,926
It's the third one born
since yesterday with
an incredible aggressiveness.

318
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:51,137
Almost, well,
homicidal in its intensity.

319
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,556
Uh, some sort ofvirus?
No.

320
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,267
We've done every sort oftest.

321
00:39:56,352 --> 00:40:00,897
It's very strange.
All the children come from
the same area around Southgate.

322
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:04,025
Near the river.
We tested the water too.

323
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:08,071
That's curious.
What is?

324
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:12,492
Well, there's a farm over there
where they've set up some sort
of machine to destroy insects...

325
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:16,204
by means of ultrasonic rays
or something.

326
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:20,333
I thought perhaps-
You know.

327
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,335
How interesting.

328
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:26,923
I'd like to have a look at it.
Do you think you could
show me where it is?

329
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:40,437
You can see, Doctor, the radiation
works on the insect's nervous system.

330
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:43,398
It drives them mad
and they attack one another.

331
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:47,444
I think we're gonna see
a real revolution in agriculture.

332
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:51,865
Not even DDT was this effective
when it first came out.

333
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:54,367
DDT causes cancer.
How 'bout this?

334
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:58,163
Now, listen, you've been
on our back since last night.

335
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:00,957
Now, if you want
to go back to nature,

336
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:04,961
why don't you find yourself
a nice Pacific atoll somewhere-

337
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:09,549
Sure. All I'd have to worry
about then is atomic fallout.

338
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,634
Thanks awfully, old chap.

339
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,472
What's the range
ofthis machine?
Oh, about a mile at present.

340
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:18,308
We're trying to perfect one
up to five miles.

341
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:23,188
But ofcourse this can't have
anything to do with the children,
now, could it? It's absurd!

342
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,565
Now, Doctor,
you're a man ofscience.

343
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:30,153
Surely you can understand
this machine has undergone
the most stringent testing.

344
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:33,573
The radiation only affects
the most primitive forms
of nervous systems,

345
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,575
like microbes and insects.

346
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:39,829
It has no effect
on more evolved systems,
such as human ones.

347
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:42,332
It's completely harmless.

348
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:46,085
How can you be certain?
Look, do I look like
I'm about to attack you?

349
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,171
And I'm surrounded
by radiation.

350
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:50,924
Now, it's all right.
I understand.

351
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:54,093
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

352
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:57,430
Well, perhaps they're right.
It's not the answer.

353
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:01,017
I'm afraid not.

354
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:06,064
Still, you know,
a newborn child's nervous system
is still in a very elementary state.

355
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:10,944
Well, if you have any doubts,
why don't you do something-
make some noise, insist on more tests?

356
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:13,029
It's never wise to exaggerate.

357
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:23,790
We can't even get the government
to act on much more serious
and concrete facts these days.

358
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:28,711
Imagine what success we'll have
getting anyone to do anything
on a mere hypothesis.

359
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:31,297
I'm afraid they'd laugh at us.

360
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:39,847
I don't understand.

361
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:42,308
You can only see Katie.

362
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,394
But look at her.

363
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:48,273
Doesn't it seem as ifsomeone
or something's after her?

364
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:50,733
Mm-hmm.

365
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:53,069
It's a good thing the police
haven't seen this one.

366
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:56,239
She really looks as if
she's about to do him in.

367
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:58,533
So you think
she's guilty too.

368
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:03,121
But I tell you, the man exists.
I saw him!

369
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:05,331
Listen, you knew him.

370
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:08,251
I mean, that tramp we heard about,
the one who drowned last week.

371
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:10,420
- Oh, Guthrie.
- Yes!

372
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:14,257
- Ofcourse. Why?
- Do you have a picture of him
or anything?

373
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:17,010
No.
Look.

374
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:19,762
I know it sounds silly,
but is it possible-

375
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:23,141
I mean, could a film f ail to catch
an image for any reason?

376
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,853
Well, a ghost, maybe.

377
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:32,191
No one believes in ghosts anymore,
including the police.

378
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:36,362
You see, we're not quite
as stupid as you seem
to think we are.

379
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,698
Ah, very interesting.

380
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:42,577
Now I can see why you wanted
to keep this roll offilm.

381
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:45,079
Look, she had nothing
to do with it.
It was my idea.

382
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,415
Ofcourse.
You're all in it together.

383
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:51,461
Aiding and abetting a suspect,
withholding information.

384
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:54,297
You and your bird here will have
to answer for it at the inquest.

385
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:59,052
I don't suppose it ever occurred to you
that you fellas could just possibly
be barking up the wrong tree.

386
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:02,889
Not when dealing
with people like you.

387
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:05,183
You're all the same,
the lot of you,

388
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:08,478
with your long hair
and faggot clothes,

389
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:12,273
drugs, sex, every sort offilth.

390
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:14,233
And you hate the police.

391
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,110
Don't ya?
You make it easy.

392
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:20,657
See you at the inquest.

393
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:25,745
And, uh, don't get any ideas
about not being there.

394
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:28,039
Heil Hitler.

395
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:36,089
We've got ourselves into
enough hot water for today.

396
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:38,007
Let's get back to the hotel.

397
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:42,929
You're offabout?
Who's paying for the pictures?
That'll be two quid.

398
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:45,556
Here you are.
Thanks foryour trouble.
It was nothing, miss.

399
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:48,643
Oh, by the way,
you wanted Guthrie's picture.

400
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:52,188
There's one here
in Monday's paper...

401
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:56,109
taken right after they
took him out ofthe water.

402
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:04,701
Oh, my God! George.

403
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,327
What is it?
It's him!

404
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:09,622
The man I saw,
the one who killed Martin!
But that's absurd. The man's dead.

405
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:12,250
But I tell you, it's him!
Look, love, use your head.

406
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:14,919
He died last week
and Martin was killed last night.

407
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:18,506
George, I tell you,
that is the man, and
his clothes were all wet.

408
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,550
He looked exactly like
someone who drowned.

409
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:23,970
Listen, are you certain he's dead?
I mean, was there
a death certificate?

410
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:26,597
Oh, sure. I was there
when they put him
in the coffin.

411
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:29,434
And two days ago
we took him to the cemetery.

412
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:32,395
No one wanted to bury him
because he didn't have any money.

413
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:34,689
In fact, they didn't even
want him to be cremated.

414
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:37,316
It's all there in the paper.
You read it.

415
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:40,445
Then he must have a twin brother,
that's all. Thanks a lot.

416
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:48,578
What are we going to do now?
Get in.

417
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:08,222
Craig! They're up to something.
Follow them and keep me
up to date.

418
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:10,767
Yes, Sergeant.
Wait, wait.

419
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:13,644
Better take my car.
Oh, all right.

420
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,534
Where are we going?

421
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:32,872
To the only place
where I can cure you
of your fancy hallucinations.

422
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:44,026
Here we are.

423
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:48,447
George. Wait a minute.
Ifthe man is dead,
he must be here, right?

424
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,533
We'll find out
if he's here, okay?

425
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:55,037
If he is here, then I want you
to knock it offabout seeing
a man in black and all that rot...

426
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:57,456
because, love,
the dead don't walk around,

427
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,542
except in very bad
paperback novels.

428
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:02,420
They're dead, and that's that.
Do we agree?

429
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:04,463
If you say so.

430
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:49,342
Anyone about?

431
00:48:56,975 --> 00:49:00,186
All right. Let's try in there.

432
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:14,909
Hello? Anyone at home?

433
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:10,006
Hello?

434
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:13,342
Let's go.
There's no one here.

435
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:17,054
No, wait a minute.
Maybe this Guthrie's
in one ofthese.

436
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:21,308
"Mary Duggan."

437
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:27,231
Hello, darling.

438
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:33,154
Who are you?

439
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:36,073
"Edward Keith."

440
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:43,873
"Guthrie Wilson."
Here he is.

441
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:52,339
George, let's go.

442
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,988
What the-

443
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:30,294
Hey! You've shut us in!

444
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:32,213
Hey!

445
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:37,384
Let us out!

446
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:40,763
Let us out!

447
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:00,658
George!

448
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:09,125
George!

449
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,673
Stop!

450
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:46,472
I don't believe it.

451
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:07,451
Get up that ladder
as fast as you can! Move!

452
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:34,728
George!

453
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:06,552
George!

454
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:11,348
Get out! Get out!

455
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:14,268
Hurry!

456
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:24,903
Help!

457
00:55:57,562 --> 00:55:59,938
Craig here.
- Have you found 'em yet?

458
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,982
Yes, Sergeant.
They're in the cemetery.

459
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:04,068
The cemetery?
What the hell are they
doing in there?

460
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:06,612
I don't know, Sarge.
I wasjust gonna go in
and have a look.

461
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:23,796
George!

462
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:31,303
Strewth!
Give us your hand.

463
00:56:57,205 --> 00:57:00,541
Let's get out of here, quick!
What the devil's happening here?
Would you please explain?

464
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:10,050
Get inside, quickly!

465
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:13,220
Get inside!

466
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:16,682
Quickly! Go on!

467
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:18,684
Go on!

468
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,359
Christ! There's no way out.

469
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:07,524
That's useless.
Come on. Help me.

470
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:37,763
They're- They're dead,
aren't they?

471
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:40,182
Yeah.

472
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:42,851
But don't ask me,
'cause I haven't the foggiest.

473
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:45,562
Christ only knows
what brought them
back to life again.

474
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:58,075
Oh, God.

475
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:00,536
I think I do know.

476
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,538
The radiation!

477
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:06,291
Ofcourse. It worked
on the babies' nervous system.
Why not on those ofthe dead?

478
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:08,377
What the hell
are you raving about, man?

479
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:12,548
Craig, when a person dies,
perhaps the nervous system
goes on living for a while.

480
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:15,467
Perhaps in some very
basic, crude way,

481
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,469
like an insect's.

482
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:22,349
Or a plant.
Look, you can pick a flower,
but it goes on living for a while.

483
00:59:22,433 --> 00:59:24,393
You're right.
That man Guthrie,

484
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:26,645
didn't he die when they
began the experiment?

485
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:29,147
Well, all right.
He was the first, but the others-

486
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:32,025
They transmit life to each other
through the blood ofthe living.

487
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:34,903
Like a plague.
That's why they kill.

488
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:40,492
Now you know who it was
that killed Martin.

489
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:44,204
I can just imagine the sergeant's face
when he finds out.

490
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:46,873
I'd like to be there
when he does.

491
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:51,044
Ifwe get out ofthis alive.

492
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:55,841
Let's reinforce that door.

493
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:57,926
Take the lamp!

494
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:10,606
This won't hold very long.
We've got to find a way
to defend ourselves.

495
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:13,942
What with?
Silver bullets or a wooden stake?

496
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:15,986
Oh!

497
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:24,244
My radio- It's the sergeant
trying to get through.

498
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:26,538
I must have left it
near that hole outside.

499
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:32,085
If I could just get to it,
or get to the car,
I could call for help.

500
01:00:36,382 --> 01:00:38,300
Craig, can you hear me?

501
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:42,846
What the Christ has happened
to the lazy bastard?

502
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:45,182
Ah, he turned his set off.

503
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:47,768
Craig, can you hear me?

504
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:51,897
The coroner'sjust completed
his examination, Sergeant.

505
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:53,982
Will you drive him back?
Yes.

506
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:00,781
I sent a man
to trail two suspects,

507
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:03,241
but I don't get any answer.

508
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:05,243
It's funny.

509
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:10,749
I'll send you an ambulance.
Take the body to the hospital.
We'll have to have an autopsy.

510
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:28,016
Help me to move this.
I'm gonna get the radio.

511
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:30,227
Craig, it's madness!
You'll never make it.

512
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:32,312
It's our only chance.

513
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:40,779
Okay.

514
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:44,032
Maybe you'll think better
ofthe police if I can pull this off.

515
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:46,952
Good luck, man.

516
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:06,888
Sergeant, this is Craig reporting
at the cemetery.

517
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:09,975
There are dead people
trying to kill me!

518
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:19,609
No!

519
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:12,829
Christ, we've got to
get out of here.
No, George. I'm afraid.

520
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:16,041
What difference does that make?
[ Crashing ]

521
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:16,434
Come.

522
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:43,253
You take the Mini
back to the cottage
and tell the police what's happened.

523
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:47,215
What about you?
I'm gonna fix that bloody machine.

524
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:52,012
Come on.

525
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:54,264
It's all over with now.

526
01:04:54,348 --> 01:04:56,349
There's no more danger.

527
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:07,027
And Martin-
His body's still back there.
The radiation could-

528
01:05:07,111 --> 01:05:10,614
No. They only have a range
ofa mile or so.

529
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:13,909
The cottage is at least
three or four miles away.

530
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:17,120
Go on.
I'll wait foryou at the farm.

531
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:36,848
Edna!

532
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:08,088
It was the machine!
You've gotta stop it.
What are you doing?

533
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:11,216
Wait. Wait. Now, look.
Wait! Listen!

534
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:14,135
You talk about the dead walkin',
about cannibalism.

535
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:16,137
It's unscientific, man.

536
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:18,890
Lots ofthings are unscientific,
but they happen just the same.

537
01:06:19,016 --> 01:06:21,101
Turn off
that goddamn machine!
Get along there.

538
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:25,355
Aye. It runs like a charm, laddie.
It's killed everybody in sight round here,
except foryou.

539
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:28,191
And we got the range
up to five miles now.
Five miles?

540
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:30,193
Aye, five bloody miles.
Since when?

541
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:32,487
A little while ago.
Just before you got here.

542
01:06:32,571 --> 01:06:34,489
Hold him! And stop him!

543
01:06:34,615 --> 01:06:36,908
Stop him!
Hey, what do you think
you're doing?

544
01:06:37,034 --> 01:06:39,035
I'm gonna have to call
the police, you know.

545
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:41,788
Right!
Bernard, what are you
doing on the ground?

546
01:06:41,914 --> 01:06:45,750
He's broken our cinescope.
I'll go for the police.

547
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:48,253
No, don't chase him again, Clive.

548
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:50,463
Come on, Bernard.

549
01:06:52,299 --> 01:06:55,301
Hey! Wait! Stop!

550
01:06:55,386 --> 01:06:58,263
I've got to get
to the Madison's place!

551
01:06:59,932 --> 01:07:02,684
Hey, wait!

552
01:07:02,768 --> 01:07:05,228
Wait!

553
01:07:05,312 --> 01:07:08,273
We have to burn the corpse!
Don't you understand?

554
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:11,317
There's not a moment to lose!

555
01:07:11,402 --> 01:07:14,279
Come back!
We're all in danger!

556
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:26,041
Well?
She had any calls
from her sister or that man?

557
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:28,668
Nothing at all.
Thank you.

558
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:41,806
No, Sergeant.
No one's seen them,
and they haven't called.

559
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:45,185
Phone in for reinforcements
and search for them.

560
01:07:45,269 --> 01:07:48,730
Make a house-to-house
and scour the countryside.

561
01:07:48,814 --> 01:07:50,732
And arm the men.

562
01:07:50,816 --> 01:07:54,110
They killed Craig and the caretaker,
so ifthey resist, shoot to kill.

563
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:07,665
Poor Craig.

564
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:10,251
If you'd only had time
to notify us.

565
01:08:15,299 --> 01:08:18,426
The thing I don't understand
is the difference in the bodies.

566
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:20,678
Those have been
horribly mutilated,

567
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:23,640
whereas those look like
they were intact.

568
01:08:23,724 --> 01:08:27,477
What the hell
did they burn the bodies for?
That's what I wanna know.

569
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:31,981
Couple ofdrug-crazy maniacs.

570
01:08:32,066 --> 01:08:34,317
Oh, worse than that, Sergeant.

571
01:08:39,573 --> 01:08:44,577
Have you ever come across
any ofthese satanists
in your investigations?

572
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:47,455
No, but I've heard about them.

573
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:49,541
Y-You don't think-

574
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:51,709
They vandalize cemeteries.

575
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:56,339
They profane tombs
and, you know, hold black masses.

576
01:08:56,423 --> 01:08:58,466
That's whyyou've got your cross.

577
01:08:58,551 --> 01:09:01,553
It looks to me
like a pretty typical case.

578
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:07,851
Now, if I could only
get me hands on them.

579
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:18,945
Oh, Sergeant.
That madman went to a nearby farm
and caused a row over there.

580
01:09:19,029 --> 01:09:20,947
Perhaps you should talk to them.

581
01:09:21,031 --> 01:09:23,324
Uh, excuse me.
The sergeant's in charge
ofthe case.

582
01:09:23,450 --> 01:09:26,202
Very pleased to meet you.
This gentleman's from
the Ministry ofAgriculture.

583
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:37,255
Sergeant?

584
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:50,602
Sergeant Mahoney!

585
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:02,280
Sergeant!

586
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:32,518
No!

587
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:18,041
Edna, what's happened?
What's happened, Edna?

588
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:22,503
Martin.

589
01:12:22,588 --> 01:12:26,215
He tried to kill me.

590
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:28,760
I ran over him with the car.

591
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:30,845
He's back there.

592
01:12:32,306 --> 01:12:34,766
George!

593
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:38,478
I'm so- I'm so frightened.

594
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:41,439
It's so awful.

595
01:12:56,872 --> 01:12:59,791
Can you manage?
Petrol. How many gallons?

596
01:12:59,917 --> 01:13:02,001
Quick. Help me.
Oh, the poor lassie.

597
01:13:02,086 --> 01:13:05,046
- Is there a phone about?
- Yes, in there. Inside.

598
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:07,757
Okay. Call for an ambulance,
and hurry up!

599
01:13:07,841 --> 01:13:09,842
Hey, what are you doing?
That's paraffin.

600
01:13:09,927 --> 01:13:12,887
I haven't time to explain.
I'll be back in a few minutes.

601
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:22,814
Marie, get her
something to drink.

602
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,651
Now, you just sit down there.

603
01:13:27,694 --> 01:13:30,405
Move! Get her
something to drink.

604
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:34,033
Water, not whiskey!
She may not have any money.

605
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:44,168
Come on, lass.
We're to call the hospital.

606
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,841
Are you all right, love?

607
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:53,302
No!

608
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:40,057
Grab him!

609
01:14:42,269 --> 01:14:43,895
Let go!

610
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:49,901
Sorry to spoil your fun, old boy,
but we sent Martin's body
to the hospital...

611
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:52,153
for an autopsy.

612
01:14:52,237 --> 01:14:54,530
As for poor old Benson,
I'd like to-

613
01:14:54,615 --> 01:14:57,575
Sergeant, listen to me.
Put out an alarm at once.

614
01:14:57,659 --> 01:15:00,828
If Martin arrives at the hospital,
we're right back where we started.

615
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:04,165
There are three bodies in there,
and he can bring them back to life!

616
01:15:04,249 --> 01:15:06,918
Bring the dead back to life,
is it?

617
01:15:07,002 --> 01:15:09,837
What kind of idiots
do you think we are?

618
01:15:09,922 --> 01:15:11,881
It's the truth.
You've got to stop him!

619
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:14,800
Get him out of here before-
Can't you see?
We've got to burn him!

620
01:15:14,927 --> 01:15:17,595
That's enough ofthat.
Go to the hospital
if you don't believe me!

621
01:15:18,639 --> 01:15:22,016
All right then, Bernard.
See if you can switch on.
Right.

622
01:15:24,102 --> 01:15:26,145
Well done, Clive.

623
01:16:58,238 --> 01:17:01,073
This!
What's the meaning ofthis?

624
01:17:02,326 --> 01:17:04,577
Oh, for crying out loud.
What do you think I am?

625
01:17:04,661 --> 01:17:06,704
I've never been
to a black mass in my life.

626
01:17:06,788 --> 01:17:10,291
How many times
do I have to tell you?
I sell this kind ofstuff, Sergeant.

627
01:17:10,375 --> 01:17:13,085
I was bringing this lot
to a shopkeeper in Windermere.

628
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:15,129
He was-
Oh, what's the use?

629
01:17:15,213 --> 01:17:20,051
You expect us to believe all that
after everything that's happened?

630
01:17:20,135 --> 01:17:23,888
Look, it's not my fault, Sergeant,
ifChrist and saints
are out of fashion.

631
01:17:23,972 --> 01:17:26,932
And it's not against the law yet,
so why don't you get off my back?

632
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:30,519
Where's your girlfriend hiding?
Go find her,
since you know so much.

633
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:34,523
You admitted
burning the corpses.
Well, I told you why!

634
01:17:34,608 --> 01:17:36,609
We caught you in the act as well,

635
01:17:36,693 --> 01:17:40,321
and this here statement clearly confirms
what we already know.

636
01:17:40,405 --> 01:17:42,907
Sign here, and it'll be
a lot easier foryou.

637
01:17:42,991 --> 01:17:45,993
Admit killing two officers,
and it'll be all over.

638
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:48,287
It was the corpses.

639
01:17:48,372 --> 01:17:52,166
Don't you understand?
The corpses. The corpses!

640
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:55,336
You sit in here wasting time,
and there are people in real danger!

641
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:58,005
You- You're the ones
who are crazy, not me!

642
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:00,049
You bloody idiot!

643
01:18:01,259 --> 01:18:03,719
The son of a bitch
killed two of my men!

644
01:18:03,804 --> 01:18:05,805
Get ahold of yourself, man.

645
01:18:08,433 --> 01:18:11,018
Go clean him up.

646
01:18:11,103 --> 01:18:14,271
Come with me.
Come with me, please.

647
01:18:20,195 --> 01:18:23,030
I disapprove
of your methods, Sergeant.

648
01:18:23,115 --> 01:18:25,449
The police should never
resort to violence.

649
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:28,994
And I disapprove of yours,
Mr. Perkins.

650
01:18:29,079 --> 01:18:32,790
Ifwejust had a free hand
with these criminals.

651
01:19:32,309 --> 01:19:35,227
Sergeant! Sergeant,
he got away.

652
01:19:35,353 --> 01:19:38,022
Kinsey! Kinsey!
I tried to stop him,
but I couldn't.

653
01:19:50,869 --> 01:19:53,287
Where's she gone?
Look at the mess she's made!

654
01:19:53,371 --> 01:19:56,749
You might have told me she was violent.
You'll pay for this down to the last penny!

655
01:19:56,875 --> 01:20:00,085
Where is she?
You told me to call an ambulance.
They took her to the hospital.

656
01:20:00,212 --> 01:20:03,672
Hospital?
All that talk about the dead
coming to life.

657
01:20:03,757 --> 01:20:06,425
I think she must be insane.

658
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:21,190
So how was the film?
Come on. Tell me all about it.

659
01:20:21,274 --> 01:20:23,275
[ Buzzing ]
Hold on.

660
01:20:24,402 --> 01:20:26,362
Southgate Hospital.
Good evening.

661
01:20:26,446 --> 01:20:28,405
Get me Duffield!
You're all in terrible danger!

662
01:20:28,532 --> 01:20:31,033
Yes. Can I help you, please?
Christ! Don't waste time!

663
01:20:31,159 --> 01:20:33,869
Give me the operating room!
I can't do that. I mean-

664
01:20:33,954 --> 01:20:37,790
Look, let me speak to Dr. Duffield!
He'll understand.
Hurry up, for Christ's sake!

665
01:20:37,874 --> 01:20:41,961
Hold on a minute, Christine.
You ought to hear the bloke
on the other line. He's balmy.

666
01:20:42,045 --> 01:20:43,295
Yeah.

667
01:20:47,592 --> 01:20:50,761
Then help me. No!

668
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:53,514
No. Please.

669
01:20:58,436 --> 01:21:00,813
Room 5.

670
01:21:02,107 --> 01:21:04,024
Doctor, it's foryou.

671
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:11,657
Hello!

672
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:22,376
Hello? Hello?

673
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:37,224
What are you waiting for, man?

674
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:43,439
I don't know, Dr. Duffield.

675
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:46,150
He didn't say who he was.

676
01:21:47,152 --> 01:21:49,069
Very well.

677
01:21:50,488 --> 01:21:54,158
Sorry. What were you saying
about that film?

678
01:21:54,242 --> 01:21:56,994
Oh, no. I can't stand him.

679
01:21:57,078 --> 01:21:59,413
He's really awful.

680
01:21:59,497 --> 01:22:02,291
Don't like her much either. No.

681
01:22:02,375 --> 01:22:04,585
Oh, she looks like-

682
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:09,358
Please, Doctor.
Can't you let me see my sister?

683
01:23:09,442 --> 01:23:13,612
Just two minutes. The officer's gone,
and my sister would be so happy.

684
01:23:14,906 --> 01:23:16,824
Yes, it'll do her good.

685
01:23:16,908 --> 01:23:18,909
Come along now.

686
01:23:41,099 --> 01:23:43,100
She's up on the second floor.

687
01:24:00,118 --> 01:24:02,077
Martin!

688
01:24:04,956 --> 01:24:07,541
No! Help! Martin!

689
01:24:08,543 --> 01:24:10,461
Oh!

690
01:24:12,213 --> 01:24:14,131
Help! Help!

691
01:24:17,427 --> 01:24:19,303
Help!

692
01:24:54,798 --> 01:24:57,591
Katie.

693
01:24:57,675 --> 01:25:00,260
Don't worry about me.

694
01:25:00,345 --> 01:25:02,304
I'm much better now.

695
01:25:14,609 --> 01:25:17,569
Help! Help! Help me!

696
01:25:17,654 --> 01:25:20,405
Help me!

697
01:25:20,490 --> 01:25:23,909
Help! No!

698
01:25:24,035 --> 01:25:26,328
What's going on?
Nothing.

699
01:25:26,412 --> 01:25:28,539
Must be that lunatic
in Room 5.

700
01:25:28,623 --> 01:25:32,167
She was screaming like that earlier
when they brought her in. Convulsions.

701
01:25:32,293 --> 01:25:35,212
Who's with her?
Dr. Duffield.
It's all right.

702
01:26:03,616 --> 01:26:06,368
- Edna!
- George!

703
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:22,551
George!

704
01:26:22,635 --> 01:26:24,595
Get away from me!

705
01:27:24,572 --> 01:27:26,490
Edna.

706
01:28:12,578 --> 01:28:16,581
I wish the dead could
come back to life, you bastard,

707
01:28:16,666 --> 01:28:18,917
because then
I could kill you again.

708
01:28:36,102 --> 01:28:39,688
Keep out ofthe way.
Out ofthe way, please.

709
01:28:39,772 --> 01:28:42,941
Please tell us how to take care
ofall the bodies.

710
01:28:43,026 --> 01:28:45,527
Put 'em on ice
till the coroner gets here.

711
01:28:49,824 --> 01:28:51,742
Come on. Let's go.

712
01:28:53,494 --> 01:28:56,246
No, that's enough ofthat.
Come on. Let's get out.

713
01:29:11,554 --> 01:29:13,930
Where to?
Back to the station?

714
01:29:14,015 --> 01:29:17,017
No, I booked a room
in the hotel here.

715
01:29:17,101 --> 01:29:21,772
All I need is a good night's sleep
and time to forget
this whole bloody mess.

716
01:29:23,149 --> 01:29:26,526
I don't think you'll do that.
The papers'll be going crazy over it.

717
01:29:26,611 --> 01:29:30,572
They like you. It looks like
you'll be a regular hero.

718
01:29:30,656 --> 01:29:33,116
Justice has been a bit slow
in these parts,

719
01:29:33,201 --> 01:29:36,411
with all this permissive rot
going on.

720
01:29:36,496 --> 01:29:40,332
Maybe people learned a thing or two
from my example here.

721
01:29:49,384 --> 01:29:51,718
They say that machine
works wonders.

722
01:29:51,803 --> 01:29:54,971
It killed every parasite for miles.

723
01:29:55,056 --> 01:29:57,849
We'll have a fabulous
apple crop this year, Sergeant.

724
01:29:57,975 --> 01:30:01,019
I'm mad about apples.

725
01:30:06,651 --> 01:30:09,528
Good night, Sergeant.
Good night, Kinsey.
