Secondhand Lion

00:00:38,126 --> 00:00:40,390
Let's roll!

2
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,505
Hey!
l'm coming!

3
00:01:07,957 --> 00:01:09,549
Huh?!

4
00:01:13,963 --> 00:01:15,988
Yes!

5
00:01:18,968 --> 00:01:21,459
- Are you and l going fast?
- Hey!

6
00:01:38,687 --> 00:01:41,019
- Hello?
- Walter?

7
00:01:41,256 --> 00:01:44,157
- Yes?
- l have some bad news.

8
00:01:44,193 --> 00:01:46,184
lt's about your
two uncles, son.

9
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:49,459
Walter?

10
00:01:49,498 --> 00:01:53,662
Walter? Walter?

11
00:01:53,702 --> 00:01:55,101
Good news--

12
00:01:55,137 --> 00:01:57,935
you're spending the summer
with your two uncles.

13
00:02:00,309 --> 00:02:03,676
lt's just gonna be for a few weeks.
A month or two, tops.

14
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,614
Scout's honor, okay?

15
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:11,647
Cross my heart
and hope to die, okay?

16
00:02:12,654 --> 00:02:14,952
Where are you going
this time?

17
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:18,482
The Fort Worth College
of Court Reporting.

18
00:02:18,527 --> 00:02:19,994
l met a guy
last night.

19
00:02:20,029 --> 00:02:22,054
He's gonna pull
some strings.

20
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:27,567
Walter, you're gonna have
to learn to trust people,

21
00:02:27,603 --> 00:02:30,629
or you're gonna grow up
bitter and disappointed.

22
00:02:32,941 --> 00:02:35,967
You're gonna have fun
with your two uncles. You'll see.

23
00:02:36,011 --> 00:02:38,138
Mom, you're
an only child.

24
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,705
l know
what uncles are.

25
00:02:41,717 --> 00:02:44,777
Well, Mr. Smarty Pants,

26
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,846
lt just so happens,
they really are your uncles.

27
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,790
Your great-uncles.

28
00:02:49,825 --> 00:02:51,793
My mother's brothers.

29
00:02:51,827 --> 00:02:55,490
They disappeared 40 years ago
and just showed up back here in Texas.

30
00:02:55,531 --> 00:02:57,590
- Can't l come with you?
- No!

31
00:02:59,101 --> 00:03:03,697
Honey, l'm gonna be working my tail
off learning court reporting.

32
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:06,606
l'm doing everything
l can to keep this family together.

33
00:03:06,642 --> 00:03:10,043
How about a little
help here, okay?

34
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:17,715
Now, look--
they say these two old men

35
00:03:17,753 --> 00:03:21,519
got millions
stashed away in cash.

36
00:03:21,557 --> 00:03:23,616
Nobody knows
where they got it.

37
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:27,186
Got no kids, no one to leave
all that money to.

38
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:29,754
You and me, we're as close
as any family they got.

39
00:03:32,234 --> 00:03:34,099
You want them
to like me

40
00:03:34,136 --> 00:03:37,105
so they'll die and leave us
their money?

41
00:03:38,507 --> 00:03:41,601
We could buy a house,
maybe settle down.

42
00:03:41,643 --> 00:03:43,838
Oh, wouldn't that
be nice?

43
00:03:45,047 --> 00:03:47,242
Oh, look! Here it is.

44
00:03:47,282 --> 00:03:49,842
Here it is, honey.
Here it is.

45
00:03:52,855 --> 00:03:54,186
By the way,

46
00:03:54,223 --> 00:03:56,657
l hear these two were in
some state nuthouse for 40 years.

47
00:03:56,692 --> 00:03:58,853
Got all their money
from a big lawsuit or something.

48
00:03:58,894 --> 00:04:02,193
But then there's
lots of stories about them.

49
00:04:02,231 --> 00:04:05,200
Who knows what
to believe?

50
00:04:05,234 --> 00:04:09,034
Just find out where they stashed
all that money, okay?

51
00:04:09,071 --> 00:04:11,130
Maybe we should've
called first.

52
00:04:11,173 --> 00:04:14,574
No. Older people
just love surprises!

53
00:04:15,477 --> 00:04:17,775
Here we are.

54
00:04:20,516 --> 00:04:21,983
Okay.

55
00:04:31,193 --> 00:04:32,490
Go away, go away!

56
00:04:32,528 --> 00:04:35,258
Hey, go away! Shoo!

57
00:04:35,297 --> 00:04:38,494
Show 'em you're friendly, honey.
Let them smell your hand.

58
00:04:43,972 --> 00:04:46,065
They must be down there
by that lake.

59
00:04:46,108 --> 00:04:48,633
Let's go!
Come on!

60
00:04:51,113 --> 00:04:53,013
There he is!

61
00:04:54,316 --> 00:04:57,217
- Winged him.
- He's running for it.

62
00:05:01,957 --> 00:05:04,755
- Damn! Empty.
- Get ammo. l'll keep him covered.

63
00:05:04,793 --> 00:05:05,782
Yoo-hoo!

64
00:05:07,329 --> 00:05:09,229
Huh?

65
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,599
Yoo-hoo!

66
00:05:12,634 --> 00:05:15,000
You send for a hooker?

67
00:05:15,037 --> 00:05:18,495
Uncle Hub, Uncle Garth,
it's me, Mae!

68
00:05:21,176 --> 00:05:22,837
Mae!

69
00:05:24,313 --> 00:05:26,804
Pearl's daughter.

70
00:05:26,848 --> 00:05:28,975
And l brought Walter,

71
00:05:29,017 --> 00:05:30,382
your nephew.

72
00:05:31,887 --> 00:05:34,879
- Relatives.
- Damn! God.

73
00:05:37,426 --> 00:05:39,189
We're old, damn it.
Leave us alone!

74
00:05:39,228 --> 00:05:41,719
The last thing we need is
some little sissy boy

75
00:05:41,763 --> 00:05:43,230
hanging around all summer.

76
00:05:44,233 --> 00:05:45,598
Walter, honey,

77
00:05:45,634 --> 00:05:48,831
why don't you wait out here
and play, okay? l'll be a minute.

78
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:00,541
He could help out around here,
do chores.

79
00:06:00,582 --> 00:06:03,107
Help out?
Your kid's a damn wienie.

80
00:06:03,151 --> 00:06:06,848
l know. That's why he needs
to be around real men,

81
00:06:06,888 --> 00:06:10,517
like you two.
lt won't be for long.

82
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:13,585
He's got to cook for his
damn self. l'm not cooking.

83
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:23,936
Nice doggie.
Come play.

84
00:06:25,774 --> 00:06:28,743
This is for your own good,
Walter.

85
00:06:28,777 --> 00:06:30,074
You know--

86
00:06:30,112 --> 00:06:32,842
l bet all that money
is hidden real close by.

87
00:06:32,881 --> 00:06:34,781
lmagine,
a real buried treasure

88
00:06:34,816 --> 00:06:36,977
just like in those books
you're always reading.

89
00:06:39,221 --> 00:06:43,055
Walter, maybe if you'd learn
to smile once in a while,

90
00:06:43,091 --> 00:06:45,355
then people
might like you.

91
00:06:47,095 --> 00:06:50,496
Now, come on, how about a big smile
to remember you by?

92
00:06:50,532 --> 00:06:53,399
Okay?
Come on!

93
00:06:58,473 --> 00:07:01,874
You're gonna have to work on
that smile while l'm gone, okay?

94
00:07:04,913 --> 00:07:07,882
Bye, honey!
Bye!

95
00:07:29,838 --> 00:07:31,396
Well?

96
00:08:02,637 --> 00:08:05,105
lf my mom calls,
can we hear the telephone out here?

97
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,108
Don't have one.

98
00:08:07,142 --> 00:08:09,167
No telephone?!

99
00:08:13,315 --> 00:08:16,216
ls it okay if l go inside
and watch television?

100
00:08:17,252 --> 00:08:18,276
Ain't got one.

101
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,447
No television?!

102
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,783
What do you do?

103
00:08:37,406 --> 00:08:40,341
Hey!

104
00:08:41,643 --> 00:08:44,874
Rumor has is you two have
millions stashed away.

105
00:08:44,913 --> 00:08:47,211
Why not put some of that money
to work for you

106
00:08:47,249 --> 00:08:50,776
with the high yield only investing
in gold and silver can bring?

107
00:08:53,855 --> 00:08:56,722
♫ Wee-ooh!
Wee-ooh, wee-ooh! ♫

108
00:08:56,758 --> 00:08:58,191
Can l leave you
some pamphlets?

109
00:09:01,363 --> 00:09:02,796
♫ Wee-ooh, wee-ooh ♫

110
00:09:02,831 --> 00:09:07,359
♫ Ooh, ooh, wee-ooh,
wee-ooh ♫

111
00:09:07,402 --> 00:09:11,566
♫ l can see them dancing,
the silhouettes on the shade ♫

112
00:09:11,606 --> 00:09:13,597
♫ l hear the music ♫

113
00:09:13,642 --> 00:09:16,076
♫ All the lovers on parade,

114
00:09:16,111 --> 00:09:19,080
♫ l wanna come in again ♫

115
00:09:19,114 --> 00:09:22,345
♫ l thought
you were my friend... ♫

116
00:09:22,384 --> 00:09:24,648
Gentlemen, word is out--

117
00:09:24,686 --> 00:09:26,916
you are two sophisticated
men of means--

118
00:09:27,956 --> 00:09:31,050
Hey!

119
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:37,190
♫ Movin' and a-groovin'
with that beat ♫

120
00:09:37,232 --> 00:09:44,900
♫ Jumpin' and stompin'
on the floor ♫

121
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,842
- ♫ Let me in, open up ♫
- ♫ Let me in, open up ♫

122
00:09:48,877 --> 00:09:52,142
♫ l'll open up
that door ♫

123
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:56,412
♫ l hear the music,
let me in ♫

124
00:09:56,451 --> 00:09:58,976
♫ Wee-ooh, wee-ooh. ♫

125
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:05,651
Nice evening. Peaceful.

126
00:10:12,434 --> 00:10:14,902
Hey, kid.

127
00:10:14,936 --> 00:10:18,804
You sleep up there.
ln the tower.

128
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,574
Hey-- we don't know
nothing about kids.

129
00:10:29,618 --> 00:10:32,610
- So if you need something...
- Find it yourself.

130
00:10:32,654 --> 00:10:35,054
Or better yet,
learn to do without.

131
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:39,049
- We're both getting old.
- Fixing to die any time.

132
00:10:39,094 --> 00:10:42,530
So if we kick off
in the middle of the night,

133
00:10:43,565 --> 00:10:45,863
you're on your own.

134
00:10:53,909 --> 00:10:56,503
- Jumpy little fella.
- Mmm.

135
00:10:56,545 --> 00:10:58,274
Quiet though.

136
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:03,127
Uncle Hub?

137
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:05,632
Uncle Hub?

138
00:14:21,983 --> 00:14:24,178
He's sleepwalking.

139
00:15:30,185 --> 00:15:33,848
Brand new mattress and l'm still
waking up tired and sore.

140
00:15:56,411 --> 00:15:58,675
So...

141
00:15:58,713 --> 00:16:01,807
you two
disappeared for...

142
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:04,546
40 whole years.

143
00:16:04,586 --> 00:16:06,611
Where were you?

144
00:16:09,357 --> 00:16:12,019
Africa mostly--
Morocco,

145
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,789
Algeria, Kenya--

146
00:16:13,828 --> 00:16:16,160
Not much sadder than a couple
of has-beens jabbering

147
00:16:16,197 --> 00:16:18,188
about the good old days.

148
00:16:18,233 --> 00:16:20,758
Those days are through.
So are we.

149
00:16:34,349 --> 00:16:36,909
l hate this!

150
00:16:36,951 --> 00:16:40,512
- l hate it!
- We're retired.

151
00:16:40,555 --> 00:16:44,184
Gardening is what
retired people do.

152
00:16:44,225 --> 00:16:47,126
What do we want any
damn vegetables for anyway?

153
00:16:47,161 --> 00:16:50,426
They're good for you.
Make you live to be 100.

154
00:16:50,465 --> 00:16:54,299
Oh yeah? Yeah?
To hell with that.

155
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,201
You live to be 100.

156
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:05,573
- Hey, Uncle Hub!
- Hub, how are you doing?

157
00:17:05,613 --> 00:17:06,944
Kids, say hi to Uncle Hub.

158
00:17:06,981 --> 00:17:09,245
Hub, come back here and see
who we brought.

159
00:17:09,284 --> 00:17:11,582
Uncle Garth!
Kids, say hi to Uncle Garth!

160
00:17:13,454 --> 00:17:15,422
We're here
for a nice long visit.

161
00:17:15,456 --> 00:17:19,586
The whole weekend. We know how lonely
our favorite uncles get.

162
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,767
Who the hell are you?

163
00:17:29,404 --> 00:17:31,895
- Walter.
- Walter?!

164
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,704
Mae's boy?

165
00:17:34,742 --> 00:17:38,769
Pearl's daughter-- that loose widow
woman always running around.

166
00:17:38,813 --> 00:17:41,714
- lt figures she'd muscle in.
- ls Mae here?

167
00:17:43,084 --> 00:17:44,676
How long
are you here for?

168
00:17:46,654 --> 00:17:48,884
Well, we'll just see
about that.

169
00:17:48,923 --> 00:17:51,255
We know
what you're up to.

170
00:17:52,293 --> 00:17:54,386
Don't think you're gonna
get away with it.

171
00:17:54,429 --> 00:17:57,421
Come on, boys.
Come on.

172
00:17:57,465 --> 00:18:00,093
His momma's gonna be back
before long.

173
00:18:00,134 --> 00:18:01,624
Oh, that woman? Huh!

174
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:03,899
From what l hear, she may never
come back. What then?

175
00:18:03,938 --> 00:18:05,428
Then you'd be stuck
with him.

176
00:18:08,009 --> 00:18:10,739
l'm telling you, take him
to the orphanage right this minute.

177
00:18:10,778 --> 00:18:12,405
Whether we take him
to the orphanage

178
00:18:12,447 --> 00:18:14,039
or tie him up and throw him
in the lake,

179
00:18:14,082 --> 00:18:16,573
it's our business,
not yours.

180
00:18:16,617 --> 00:18:18,710
Here he is now, spying!

181
00:18:20,154 --> 00:18:21,746
Ow! Ow, ow!

182
00:18:21,789 --> 00:18:24,485
See what l'm saying?
Did you see what he just did?

183
00:18:24,525 --> 00:18:25,514
Mmm-hmm.

184
00:18:38,473 --> 00:18:40,941
Fort Worth College
of Court Reporting.

185
00:18:40,975 --> 00:18:43,773
l need to find my mom.
She's a student there.

186
00:18:43,811 --> 00:18:45,676
l'm sorry, we're closed.

187
00:18:45,713 --> 00:18:48,045
lt's an emergency.
Please?

188
00:18:48,082 --> 00:18:50,141
Her name's Mae--
Mae Coleman.

189
00:18:52,286 --> 00:18:54,413
Um...

190
00:18:54,455 --> 00:18:59,358
No, l'm sorry, there's no
Mae Coleman registered here.

191
00:19:01,329 --> 00:19:03,456
Oh! Try Mae Carter.

192
00:19:04,899 --> 00:19:07,993
No, l'm sorry.

193
00:19:08,036 --> 00:19:09,867
Mabel Cartwright?

194
00:19:09,904 --> 00:19:11,633
Mabe Calloway?

195
00:19:11,672 --> 00:19:13,970
Donna Tompko?

196
00:19:14,008 --> 00:19:17,671
Young man, are you
in some sort of trouble?

197
00:19:17,712 --> 00:19:21,307
She's gotta be there!
She just started.

198
00:19:21,349 --> 00:19:25,342
Listen, our classes
started back in January.

199
00:19:25,386 --> 00:19:27,854
No one could have possibly
just started.

200
00:19:30,858 --> 00:19:34,294
Hello? Hello?

201
00:19:35,463 --> 00:19:37,454
Hello?

202
00:19:43,571 --> 00:19:46,563
Hub, l don't know why
you have to drive. lt's my car.

203
00:19:46,607 --> 00:19:48,165
Stop whining.

204
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:52,977
lf we find the kid, he's gonna
get a piece of my mind.

205
00:19:53,014 --> 00:19:54,982
There he is.

206
00:20:04,525 --> 00:20:06,925
Lawyer--
stay in the car!

207
00:20:06,961 --> 00:20:09,361
Hub, come on!

208
00:20:09,397 --> 00:20:11,729
- No, no. You, not me, no.
- Hub!

209
00:20:11,766 --> 00:20:13,825
Get out of the car.

210
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,758
Planning
your next move?

211
00:20:40,094 --> 00:20:42,289
Where you figure
on going?

212
00:20:44,732 --> 00:20:45,926
Here.

213
00:20:45,967 --> 00:20:47,935
Area code 406--

214
00:20:47,969 --> 00:20:50,529
Montana.

215
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:57,174
How come you're not heading
to Fort Worth where your momma is?

216
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,880
She's not there.

217
00:21:01,883 --> 00:21:03,851
She lied...

218
00:21:03,885 --> 00:21:05,250
again.

219
00:21:08,156 --> 00:21:09,919
Listen, kid,

220
00:21:09,957 --> 00:21:13,916
we know you got your heart set on
going to Montana,

221
00:21:14,962 --> 00:21:16,657
but it's late.

222
00:21:17,698 --> 00:21:20,098
Hub, help me out here.

223
00:21:20,134 --> 00:21:23,228
Why? lt sounds like
his mind's made up.

224
00:21:24,272 --> 00:21:26,069
Good luck
in Montana, kid.

225
00:21:29,343 --> 00:21:31,971
We've got better maps than that one
at the house, right, Hub?

226
00:21:32,013 --> 00:21:35,540
Yeah, a man needs a good map,
that's for sure.

227
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:36,845
Sure.

228
00:21:38,486 --> 00:21:40,852
l've been
to the orphan home before.

229
00:21:40,888 --> 00:21:42,685
l don't want to go back.

230
00:21:42,723 --> 00:21:43,849
Damn it, kid,

231
00:21:43,891 --> 00:21:46,519
it ain't our fault you got
a lousy damn mother.

232
00:22:01,142 --> 00:22:03,372
Guess l should get going.

233
00:22:03,411 --> 00:22:05,106
Which way is north?

234
00:22:12,053 --> 00:22:13,816
l'll say one thing
for this kid--

235
00:22:13,854 --> 00:22:16,345
he sure pisses off
the relatives.

236
00:22:17,491 --> 00:22:20,517
Listen, kid,
do us a favor.

237
00:22:20,561 --> 00:22:22,688
lf you come back
to the house

238
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,994
and stay awhile,

239
00:22:25,032 --> 00:22:27,933
why, our relatives
are gonna hate it.

240
00:22:27,969 --> 00:22:30,437
l'll bet they hate it
so much,

241
00:22:30,471 --> 00:22:34,032
they go away and leave us all
the hell alone.

242
00:22:35,443 --> 00:22:39,504
- lt's crazy enough it might work.
- Sure.

243
00:22:39,547 --> 00:22:43,313
Come on, kid,
help us out here.

244
00:22:46,687 --> 00:22:48,746
l guess l could
come back...

245
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,485
for a while,

246
00:22:51,525 --> 00:22:54,255
seeing it's
so important.

247
00:23:09,443 --> 00:23:11,638
So kid,

248
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,670
how's that root beer?

249
00:23:25,259 --> 00:23:28,626
Uncle Hub,
Uncle Garth,

250
00:23:28,663 --> 00:23:30,654
this has been
such...

251
00:23:30,698 --> 00:23:32,825
a wonderful weekend.

252
00:23:32,867 --> 00:23:34,630
l hate
to bring this up,

253
00:23:34,669 --> 00:23:37,661
but have you two looked
at that will l left for you?

254
00:23:41,042 --> 00:23:43,636
You both need to be thinking
about these things

255
00:23:43,678 --> 00:23:44,906
at your age.

256
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,654
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot.

257
00:24:01,696 --> 00:24:03,459
He's been
here before.

258
00:24:03,497 --> 00:24:05,488
Brothers McCann?

259
00:24:05,533 --> 00:24:07,797
This is
no ordinary salesman.

260
00:24:07,835 --> 00:24:09,803
Hell, l like me
a challenge.

261
00:24:09,837 --> 00:24:11,327
Can we talk?

262
00:24:11,372 --> 00:24:12,737
Come out where
we can see you.

263
00:24:12,773 --> 00:24:14,798
Put down your guns
and l'll come out.

264
00:24:14,842 --> 00:24:17,003
This guy is good.

265
00:24:17,044 --> 00:24:19,706
l'll cover,
you sneak around.

266
00:24:19,747 --> 00:24:21,374
...that's not complete.

267
00:24:21,415 --> 00:24:23,406
What? What do you--
what? What?

268
00:24:23,451 --> 00:24:26,147
- Why not see what he's selling?
- Let me just show it to you.

269
00:24:26,187 --> 00:24:29,122
- What the hell for?
- lt's right behind my car.

270
00:24:29,156 --> 00:24:31,454
What's the good having money
if you never spend it?

271
00:24:31,492 --> 00:24:33,756
- Trust me.
- lt could be the kid has a point.

272
00:24:33,794 --> 00:24:35,762
Yeah, well...

273
00:24:35,796 --> 00:24:37,957
we'll see
what the man's selling.

274
00:24:37,998 --> 00:24:40,694
- Then we shoot him.
- Good plan.

275
00:24:47,174 --> 00:24:49,142
Whew!

276
00:24:49,176 --> 00:24:51,872
Due to the...

277
00:24:51,912 --> 00:24:54,745
unsettling nature
of our previous encounters...

278
00:24:54,782 --> 00:24:57,649
l took it upon myself to search
the world over for that--

279
00:24:57,685 --> 00:24:59,744
that perfect item
that'd be just right

280
00:24:59,787 --> 00:25:02,517
for two exuberant sportsmen
such as yourselves.

281
00:25:02,556 --> 00:25:03,614
And boys,

282
00:25:03,657 --> 00:25:06,455
well, l do believe
l found it.

283
00:25:08,596 --> 00:25:09,995
Voilà!

284
00:25:15,035 --> 00:25:16,297
What is it?

285
00:25:17,605 --> 00:25:19,698
Well, that right there
is the sport of kings.

286
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,004
Up till now, only heads of state
have been able to afford

287
00:25:22,042 --> 00:25:23,532
a fine piece
of equipment like that,

288
00:25:23,577 --> 00:25:25,909
and it is so simple to operate
even this child could do it.

289
00:25:25,946 --> 00:25:27,413
Really?

290
00:25:27,448 --> 00:25:29,780
Here.
l'll tell you what--

291
00:25:29,817 --> 00:25:32,718
you step right up here and chunk
that lever back on my signal, okay?

292
00:25:35,356 --> 00:25:37,881
Go ahead.

293
00:25:42,229 --> 00:25:43,491
Wow!

294
00:25:43,531 --> 00:25:46,056
The most powerful one
on the market,

295
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,897
and very reasonably priced,
l might add.

296
00:25:47,935 --> 00:25:51,496
Well, that is the biggest waste of money
l have ever seen in my entire life.

297
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:54,406
Mister, you load up that contraption
and get the hell off this land.

298
00:25:54,442 --> 00:25:56,239
We'll take it.

299
00:25:56,277 --> 00:25:58,006
Oh no, you don't!

300
00:25:58,045 --> 00:26:00,411
l won't have my children
around this gun foolishness.

301
00:26:00,448 --> 00:26:02,177
Then leave!

302
00:26:03,417 --> 00:26:08,218
- Come on, Daddy, let's go.
- Come on. Come on.

303
00:26:08,255 --> 00:26:10,223
You know what happens
when my feelings get hurt.

304
00:26:10,257 --> 00:26:11,451
Get in the car.
Get in the car.

305
00:26:11,492 --> 00:26:13,221
♫ Ah, ha ♫

306
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:30,276
♫ Oh, suey! ♫

307
00:26:32,613 --> 00:26:33,637
Pull!

308
00:26:37,017 --> 00:26:38,177
Pull!

309
00:26:41,088 --> 00:26:43,147
Pull!

310
00:27:14,321 --> 00:27:18,655
- Uncle Hub?
- Don't. l tried to wake him once.

311
00:27:18,692 --> 00:27:20,853
He nearly tore
my head off.

312
00:27:20,895 --> 00:27:23,090
Leave him
for a few minutes.

313
00:27:25,933 --> 00:27:28,333
What are you doing
out here so late?

314
00:27:30,871 --> 00:27:32,862
What's wrong with him?

315
00:27:32,907 --> 00:27:35,239
Well, a man's body
may grow old,

316
00:27:35,276 --> 00:27:40,339
but inside his spirit can still be
as young and restless as ever.

317
00:27:41,415 --> 00:27:43,440
And him--

318
00:27:43,484 --> 00:27:46,317
in his day,
he had more spirit

319
00:27:46,353 --> 00:27:48,548
than 20 men.

320
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:53,627
lt looks like...

321
00:27:54,662 --> 00:27:56,152
he's looking
for something.

322
00:27:56,196 --> 00:27:58,721
- Mm-hmm.
- What?

323
00:28:02,469 --> 00:28:04,801
He's looking for her.

324
00:28:12,346 --> 00:28:13,973
Who?

325
00:28:14,014 --> 00:28:15,982
What was her name?

326
00:28:17,051 --> 00:28:18,814
Jasmine.

327
00:28:24,491 --> 00:28:26,482
Okay, tell me.

328
00:28:28,996 --> 00:28:31,829
You want me
to tell you the story?

329
00:28:31,865 --> 00:28:34,026
Now?

330
00:28:34,068 --> 00:28:36,366
That would take days.

331
00:28:41,709 --> 00:28:44,007
Well, uh...

332
00:28:45,245 --> 00:28:48,681
Hub was always
too restless for Texas.

333
00:28:48,716 --> 00:28:51,810
He convinced our folks

334
00:28:51,852 --> 00:28:54,047
that he needed to go
to Europe,

335
00:28:54,088 --> 00:28:55,885
and l needed
to come along.

336
00:28:57,291 --> 00:29:01,227
That was
the summer of 1914.

337
00:29:30,658 --> 00:29:32,785
l la-like you.

338
00:29:32,826 --> 00:29:37,024
Extra, extra!
Germany invades!

339
00:29:37,064 --> 00:29:40,090
Unfortunately,
just as we arrived in France,

340
00:29:40,134 --> 00:29:45,538
so did the Kaiser
and the entire German Army.

341
00:29:45,572 --> 00:29:47,403
l wanted to go home,

342
00:29:47,441 --> 00:29:51,377
but Hub said we should tour Europe
one step ahead of the Germans.

343
00:29:51,412 --> 00:29:55,508
And we did.
What a time that was.

344
00:29:57,017 --> 00:30:02,182
There were these girls
in Toulon-- twins. And they...

345
00:30:05,125 --> 00:30:07,559
...anyway,

346
00:30:07,594 --> 00:30:11,621
we eventually wound up
in Marseilles

347
00:30:11,665 --> 00:30:14,759
with passage booked
on the last ship out of Europe.

348
00:30:14,802 --> 00:30:19,466
And Hub, he decided
that we should spend our last night

349
00:30:19,506 --> 00:30:22,498
enjoying
the local nightlife.

350
00:30:27,548 --> 00:30:30,142
Three, three!

351
00:30:31,318 --> 00:30:34,048
He made friends
with these soldiers,

352
00:30:35,723 --> 00:30:40,820
and they bought us some drinks--
strong, strange drinks.

353
00:30:42,896 --> 00:30:45,296
We woke up on a ship

354
00:30:45,332 --> 00:30:49,735
bound for North Africa--
shanghaied.

355
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:51,965
- Shanghaied?
- Yeah.

356
00:30:52,005 --> 00:30:56,305
We found ourselves
in the French Foreign Legion.

357
00:30:56,343 --> 00:30:59,972
''lt's all my fault, '' Hub said,
but he told me not to worry.

358
00:31:00,013 --> 00:31:03,039
He'd make sure
nothing happened to me.

359
00:31:11,391 --> 00:31:14,417
We fought many battles
against overwhelming odds.

360
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:19,658
He saved my life
countless times.

361
00:31:35,482 --> 00:31:39,179
When the war was over,
we both went our separate ways.

362
00:31:39,219 --> 00:31:41,779
l ended up
leading safaris

363
00:31:41,822 --> 00:31:46,259
mostly for writers
and Hollywood folk.

364
00:31:46,293 --> 00:31:48,454
But that was
too tame for Hub.

365
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:56,034
He got commissions from the new
North African governments,

366
00:31:56,069 --> 00:31:58,367
to put an end
to the slave trade.

367
00:32:03,243 --> 00:32:06,076
No one,
slave trader or Bedouin,

368
00:32:06,113 --> 00:32:10,311
had ever seen anything
like this mad American

369
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:12,614
who fought like 20 men.

370
00:32:16,456 --> 00:32:18,219
Hey!

371
00:32:18,258 --> 00:32:21,421
What the hell are you two doing
out here in the middle of the night?

372
00:32:22,563 --> 00:32:24,622
Just enjoying
the cool night air.

373
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,291
Either one of you
got a lick of sense,

374
00:32:29,336 --> 00:32:31,270
go to bed.

375
00:33:11,378 --> 00:33:15,644
♫ l'm a rolling stone
from Texas ♫

376
00:33:15,682 --> 00:33:18,742
♫ Rolling stones
from the plains ♫

377
00:33:18,785 --> 00:33:22,778
♫ l am a rolling stone
from Texas, boys ♫

378
00:33:22,823 --> 00:33:26,259
♫ l long to be
back there again ♫

379
00:33:26,293 --> 00:33:29,956
♫ Well, say,
are you from Texas? ♫

380
00:33:29,997 --> 00:33:33,558
♫ That's what
l'm wanting to know ♫

381
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,366
♫ 'Cause if we're both
from Texas, boys ♫

382
00:33:37,404 --> 00:33:40,703
♫ Let's bundle up
our clothes and go... ♫

383
00:34:28,956 --> 00:34:30,753
''Dear Walter,

384
00:34:30,791 --> 00:34:34,318
how are you?
Found your uncles' money yet?

385
00:34:34,361 --> 00:34:36,693
Here l am at school
in Fort Worth,

386
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:38,994
my nose to the court
reporting grind... ''

387
00:34:44,137 --> 00:34:47,334
Damn it, brother, l'm not going
anywhere looking like this.

388
00:34:51,311 --> 00:34:53,438
Look like a damn
sharecropper.

389
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:57,177
We're gardeners.
This is what gardeners wear.

390
00:34:57,217 --> 00:35:00,015
l bought you some clothes too.
They're in your room.

391
00:35:04,758 --> 00:35:07,488
Think how good all these vegetables
are gonna taste.

392
00:35:07,527 --> 00:35:10,963
Peas, beans,

393
00:35:10,998 --> 00:35:14,525
squash, tomatoes.

394
00:35:14,568 --> 00:35:16,798
- Yeah.
- What's this row?

395
00:35:18,505 --> 00:35:21,167
- Beets.
- Beets?

396
00:35:25,212 --> 00:35:26,474
And what about
this row?

397
00:35:26,513 --> 00:35:29,004
- Potatoes.
- Potatoes?

398
00:35:29,049 --> 00:35:30,175
Yeah.

399
00:35:32,853 --> 00:35:34,844
Wait one damn
minute here.

400
00:35:34,888 --> 00:35:38,016
- What's this row here?
- Tomatoes.

401
00:35:38,058 --> 00:35:40,652
- Tomatoes?
- Yeah.

402
00:35:40,694 --> 00:35:42,787
That's lettuce, squash,

403
00:35:42,829 --> 00:35:47,027
sweet potatoes,
carrots, bok choy.

404
00:35:47,067 --> 00:35:50,525
- Bok Choy? What is that?
- Chinese cabbage.

405
00:35:51,738 --> 00:35:53,706
Hey, that row
looks right.

406
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,207
Yeah, well,
this is corn!

407
00:35:55,242 --> 00:35:58,700
All those seeds did look alike,
come to think of it.

408
00:35:58,745 --> 00:36:01,270
- Yeah, like corn.
- Boy...

409
00:36:01,314 --> 00:36:03,680
that seed salesman
sure saw us coming.

410
00:36:03,717 --> 00:36:04,945
No, saw you coming.

411
00:36:04,985 --> 00:36:08,182
Corn, corn, corn!

412
00:36:08,221 --> 00:36:10,189
Nothing but corn.

413
00:36:11,391 --> 00:36:14,189
Corn. Corn.

414
00:36:16,229 --> 00:36:19,392
- By God, it's here!
- Kid, help him unload.

415
00:36:19,433 --> 00:36:20,923
We'll be right back.

416
00:37:08,548 --> 00:37:11,449
Careful, kid.
He's a man-eater.

417
00:37:12,919 --> 00:37:17,515
ls this the McCann place?
We brought your lion.

418
00:37:18,758 --> 00:37:23,752
King of the beasts.
Terror of the jungle.

419
00:37:37,577 --> 00:37:40,876
You bought a lion?
A used lion?

420
00:37:40,914 --> 00:37:43,781
Stand back, kid, you don't want
to get mauled and eaten.

421
00:37:44,818 --> 00:37:46,308
- What are you doing?
- Brother,

422
00:37:46,353 --> 00:37:49,117
this is the best idea
you ever had.

423
00:37:49,156 --> 00:37:52,421
This lion head will sure look good
hanging over our fireplace.

424
00:37:52,459 --> 00:37:55,121
What fireplace?
You don't have a fireplace.

425
00:37:55,162 --> 00:37:57,062
We'll buy one.

426
00:37:58,498 --> 00:37:59,795
You're gonna shoot it?

427
00:37:59,833 --> 00:38:01,733
Well, be seeing you.

428
00:38:04,571 --> 00:38:05,936
He's in there, all right.

429
00:38:05,972 --> 00:38:08,065
l don't think this is
very sporting.

430
00:38:08,108 --> 00:38:12,238
Kid, at our age,
this is as sporting as we get.

431
00:38:12,279 --> 00:38:14,406
Walter, come here.

432
00:38:14,447 --> 00:38:17,007
When l give the word,
pull this.

433
00:38:23,557 --> 00:38:24,922
Pull!

434
00:38:34,234 --> 00:38:36,794
Hey.

435
00:38:36,836 --> 00:38:37,996
Come on out of there.

436
00:38:38,038 --> 00:38:41,496
Hey, you
in the crate!

437
00:38:41,541 --> 00:38:44,977
Get your lion butt
out of there.

438
00:38:45,011 --> 00:38:46,535
Looks awful tame.

439
00:38:49,583 --> 00:38:51,983
This lion's no good.

440
00:38:52,018 --> 00:38:56,114
lt's--
it's defective.

441
00:38:56,156 --> 00:39:00,490
- lt's alive, that's the main thing.
- Go ahead and shoot it then.

442
00:39:00,527 --> 00:39:03,496
No, it wouldn't be sporting,
shooting it inside a crate.

443
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:05,896
Looks kind of old...

444
00:39:05,932 --> 00:39:07,490
worn-out looking.

445
00:39:07,534 --> 00:39:10,401
Some kind of lion hunt
this is.

446
00:39:10,437 --> 00:39:13,201
Perfect.
A reject.

447
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,970
Some sick
zoo castoff.

448
00:39:17,177 --> 00:39:21,511
So can l keep him?

449
00:39:21,548 --> 00:39:25,143
l'll look after him and take care
of him and feed him and everything!

450
00:39:25,185 --> 00:39:26,880
l never had a pet
of my very own before.

451
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,856
So kid, you want to take care of it,
nurse it back to health?

452
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:33,757
Good.
Then we shoot it.

453
00:39:40,533 --> 00:39:42,831
That's some lion
you bought.

454
00:39:42,869 --> 00:39:45,360
That's some garden seeds
you bought.

455
00:39:48,341 --> 00:39:52,300
Don't worry, they're not as bad
as they seem right at first.

456
00:39:52,345 --> 00:39:55,371
l'll be right back
with supper.

457
00:40:05,792 --> 00:40:09,250
There.
Now you can see out.

458
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,068
You sure
he can't get out?

459
00:40:17,304 --> 00:40:19,738
She.
lt's a girl lion.

460
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:22,974
l named her Jasmine.

461
00:40:24,411 --> 00:40:26,379
What did you just say?

462
00:40:32,552 --> 00:40:36,079
lt seemed like a good name--
for a lion.

463
00:40:50,203 --> 00:40:52,398
l'm sorry it took
awhile to come in.

464
00:40:52,439 --> 00:40:54,999
ln 40 years, l never had
a call for it.

465
00:40:57,911 --> 00:41:00,539
''Purina Lion Chow.''

466
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,741
l'll be!

467
00:41:02,782 --> 00:41:05,046
lf you wait a few minutes,
my boys will load you up.

468
00:41:06,286 --> 00:41:08,277
l got it.

469
00:41:09,989 --> 00:41:12,014
Garth, pay the man.

470
00:41:12,058 --> 00:41:13,491
Be careful.

471
00:41:15,395 --> 00:41:18,057
Mr. McCann, those are bags
that weigh 50 pounds a piece.

472
00:41:21,434 --> 00:41:23,425
Take the other end.

473
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:25,665
Here we go.

474
00:41:37,117 --> 00:41:39,745
lf you two old ladies want
to get in, l'll take you home now.

475
00:41:44,224 --> 00:41:46,021
Hub!

476
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:05,700
Psst!

477
00:42:06,946 --> 00:42:07,935
Psst!

478
00:42:08,982 --> 00:42:11,314
Little boy!

479
00:42:11,351 --> 00:42:13,717
You're with those
McCann brothers?

480
00:42:18,024 --> 00:42:22,518
l know that they're
ex-mafia hit men.

481
00:42:22,562 --> 00:42:25,656
They're on the run
with millions

482
00:42:25,698 --> 00:42:29,327
that they stole
from Al Capone.

483
00:42:47,587 --> 00:42:49,179
Tell me more
about Africa--

484
00:42:49,222 --> 00:42:52,589
about you and Uncle Hub
and Jasmine.

485
00:42:52,625 --> 00:42:55,753
Why would a smart kid like you
want to hear hokey old stories?

486
00:42:57,831 --> 00:42:59,856
What else
do we have to do?

487
00:43:00,967 --> 00:43:02,434
Where was l?

488
00:43:05,038 --> 00:43:09,202
''No one, slave trader
or Bedouin,

489
00:43:09,242 --> 00:43:11,767
had ever seen anything
like this mad American

490
00:43:11,811 --> 00:43:13,506
who fought
like 20 men. ''

491
00:43:13,546 --> 00:43:16,310
Yeah right, right, right.
Well, it so happened...

492
00:43:17,417 --> 00:43:19,908
one of the women
that Hub freed

493
00:43:19,953 --> 00:43:22,581
was handmaiden
to a princess.

494
00:43:26,292 --> 00:43:30,251
When she told her mistress
the story of her rescue,

495
00:43:30,296 --> 00:43:35,495
most of all, she told her about
the handsome, heroic American.

496
00:43:37,036 --> 00:43:40,904
''l must meet this man!''
The princess said.

497
00:43:43,977 --> 00:43:49,074
One day, Hub was riding his horse
along the Mediterranean,

498
00:43:49,115 --> 00:43:53,609
when out of nowhere,
another rider came up alongside.

499
00:43:56,089 --> 00:43:59,752
But you know Hub-- he wasn't
about to let a chance pass.

500
00:43:59,792 --> 00:44:01,521
lt became a race.

501
00:44:05,632 --> 00:44:10,194
Most people say that Hub
was the best rider in North Africa.

502
00:44:12,071 --> 00:44:14,767
But this other rider
kept neck and neck

503
00:44:14,807 --> 00:44:18,265
as the race went
on and on.

504
00:44:24,484 --> 00:44:27,715
Then the two horses
collided.

505
00:44:27,754 --> 00:44:30,723
The riders went flying
into the sea.

506
00:44:30,757 --> 00:44:34,090
Hub leaped to his feet
ready for anything--

507
00:44:34,127 --> 00:44:36,152
or so he thought.

508
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:49,631
This was the princess,

509
00:44:49,676 --> 00:44:53,544
the most beautiful woman
he had ever seen.

510
00:44:56,182 --> 00:45:00,016
- Jasmine!
- Jasmine.

511
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:09,961
Many people say there's
no such thing nowadays,

512
00:45:09,996 --> 00:45:12,487
it's something
you only find in stories,

513
00:45:12,532 --> 00:45:16,662
but when these two set eyes
on each other for the first time,

514
00:45:16,703 --> 00:45:20,434
this was honest to god,
no kidding, sure enough,

515
00:45:20,473 --> 00:45:22,464
once in a lifetime,

516
00:45:22,508 --> 00:45:26,137
love at first sight.

517
00:45:32,819 --> 00:45:36,220
Wait a minute.
lf it was true love

518
00:45:36,255 --> 00:45:38,723
they would've been married
and lived happily ever after, right?

519
00:45:38,758 --> 00:45:40,919
Aren't you getting ahead
of the story?

520
00:45:42,629 --> 00:45:45,564
- Okay, keep going.
- Well...

521
00:45:45,598 --> 00:45:48,726
things weren't easy
for them back then.

522
00:45:48,768 --> 00:45:50,963
She was promised
to another man,

523
00:45:51,004 --> 00:45:54,030
a powerful sheik
in a neighboring kingdom.

524
00:45:57,543 --> 00:46:01,377
He heard that Jasmine
was in love with another,

525
00:46:01,414 --> 00:46:03,575
so he threatened
her father,

526
00:46:03,616 --> 00:46:06,016
and took Jasmine off
to his kingdom

527
00:46:06,052 --> 00:46:08,646
and locked her up
in his harem.

528
00:46:10,423 --> 00:46:14,587
She told the other wives
that she would rather die

529
00:46:14,627 --> 00:46:17,187
than marry
this heartless sheik.

530
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:19,630
She had a knife on her.

531
00:46:20,633 --> 00:46:22,794
And when he came for her
that night,

532
00:46:22,835 --> 00:46:25,235
she was going
to slit her own throat.

533
00:46:26,439 --> 00:46:28,532
What did
Uncle Hub do?

534
00:47:03,042 --> 00:47:07,445
They got married,
and lived happily ever after.

535
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,107
The end.

536
00:47:11,684 --> 00:47:13,743
But wait,

537
00:47:13,786 --> 00:47:15,447
if they lived
happily ever after,

538
00:47:15,488 --> 00:47:19,219
then they got married, and she'd
be here right now with us, right?

539
00:47:19,258 --> 00:47:21,453
Didn't they have kids?
Where are they?

540
00:47:21,494 --> 00:47:24,088
Nurse?
What's going on?

541
00:47:25,331 --> 00:47:27,526
l wish they'd tell us
something.

542
00:47:31,738 --> 00:47:33,729
Get out of my face!

543
00:47:33,773 --> 00:47:37,231
Where'd you put my damn pants?
Where's my pants?

544
00:47:37,276 --> 00:47:41,440
- You can't do that!
- Gimme my pants!

545
00:47:41,481 --> 00:47:45,212
Who put me in here?
Who put me in here? You two!

546
00:47:48,788 --> 00:47:51,154
Hospitals--
lot of good they are.

547
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:54,990
How would you know? You're never
in one long enough to find out.

548
00:47:56,095 --> 00:47:58,859
Hey, you missed
the turn.

549
00:47:58,898 --> 00:48:01,264
- l did not.
- Home is that way.

550
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:03,200
l wanna go this way.

551
00:48:13,446 --> 00:48:17,348
Doctor,
where is Mr. McCann?

552
00:48:17,383 --> 00:48:20,511
Oh, l'm afraid
he's gone.

553
00:48:25,091 --> 00:48:29,118
Well, he led
a long full life.

554
00:48:29,162 --> 00:48:31,187
Where is the body?

555
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:34,597
No, he's gone-- left.

556
00:48:34,634 --> 00:48:36,795
Mr. McCann checked
himself out.

557
00:48:36,836 --> 00:48:38,736
Left?!

558
00:48:42,341 --> 00:48:43,774
Brother,

559
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:48,110
someday you're gonna have
to start acting your age.

560
00:48:48,147 --> 00:48:50,581
What the hell
does that mean?

561
00:48:50,616 --> 00:48:53,881
All your life, you've never been
frightened of anything.

562
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,218
So what's eating
at you now?

563
00:48:56,255 --> 00:48:58,519
Getting old?

564
00:48:58,558 --> 00:49:01,220
- Dying?
- Hell no.

565
00:49:02,495 --> 00:49:05,430
- What then?
- Being useless.

566
00:49:05,464 --> 00:49:07,932
When we were young
there was always a reason,

567
00:49:07,967 --> 00:49:10,231
there was a point.
Things made sense.

568
00:49:10,269 --> 00:49:12,066
Now there's
no point to anything.

569
00:49:12,104 --> 00:49:13,571
So what do we do?
We garden.

570
00:49:13,606 --> 00:49:16,803
We outlived our time,
brother.

571
00:49:29,388 --> 00:49:31,822
- Go get some beers.
- All right.

572
00:49:31,858 --> 00:49:34,850
Hey, old man,

573
00:49:34,894 --> 00:49:36,919
how's that barbecue?

574
00:49:36,963 --> 00:49:39,397
Give me some.

575
00:49:39,432 --> 00:49:42,868
We're busy, boy.
Get lost, all right?

576
00:49:44,637 --> 00:49:46,366
What did you say?

577
00:49:46,405 --> 00:49:50,000
Here's a perfect example
of what l've been talking about.

578
00:49:50,042 --> 00:49:52,476
Since this boy was suckling on
his momma's tit,

579
00:49:52,511 --> 00:49:54,672
he's been given
everything but discipline.

580
00:49:54,714 --> 00:49:56,773
And now his idea
of courage and manhood

581
00:49:56,816 --> 00:49:58,807
is to get together with
a bunch of punk friends

582
00:49:58,851 --> 00:50:00,876
and ride around
irritating folks...

583
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:04,151
too good natured
to put a stop to it.

584
00:50:05,892 --> 00:50:08,019
Hey, who do you
think you are, huh?

585
00:50:09,829 --> 00:50:10,853
Just a dumb kid, Hub.

586
00:50:10,897 --> 00:50:12,023
- Don't kill him.
- Right.

587
00:50:16,535 --> 00:50:17,968
l'm Hub McCann.

588
00:50:18,004 --> 00:50:19,062
l fought in two World Wars

589
00:50:19,105 --> 00:50:21,266
and countless smaller ones
on three continents.

590
00:50:21,307 --> 00:50:23,434
l led thousands of men
into battle with everything

591
00:50:23,476 --> 00:50:26,001
from horses and swords
to artillery and tanks.

592
00:50:26,045 --> 00:50:28,138
l've seen the headwaters
of the Nile,

593
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:31,081
and tribes of natives no white man
had ever seen before.

594
00:50:31,117 --> 00:50:33,347
l've won and lost
a dozen fortunes,

595
00:50:33,386 --> 00:50:35,217
killed many men

596
00:50:35,254 --> 00:50:37,415
and loved
only one woman

597
00:50:37,456 --> 00:50:39,219
with a passion
a flea like you

598
00:50:39,258 --> 00:50:40,885
could never begin
to understand.

599
00:50:40,927 --> 00:50:42,656
That's who l am.

600
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:46,698
Now, go home, boy!

601
00:50:48,134 --> 00:50:50,102
We'll show these
old bastards who's tough!

602
00:50:50,136 --> 00:50:51,728
- Get out your knife.
- Yeah.

603
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:56,731
Now, boys,

604
00:50:56,776 --> 00:50:59,142
you're fixing to let
those teenage hormones

605
00:50:59,178 --> 00:51:00,611
get you into a world
of trouble.

606
00:51:02,315 --> 00:51:04,283
Damn it, Garth.
Did l ask you to butt in?

607
00:51:04,317 --> 00:51:06,182
Hub, you just
come out of the hospital.

608
00:51:06,218 --> 00:51:09,710
Well, there's--
there's only four of 'em.

609
00:51:09,755 --> 00:51:12,087
Yeah, but--
look, you fight this one first.

610
00:51:12,124 --> 00:51:15,753
And then l'll let you fight
the other three after, okay?

611
00:51:15,795 --> 00:51:18,025
Yeah.
Watch this, kid!

612
00:51:18,064 --> 00:51:20,726
Now you!
You better pick that knife up,

613
00:51:20,766 --> 00:51:25,362
'cause, son, you're gonna need
all the help you can get.

614
00:51:26,973 --> 00:51:28,497
- Come on, Frankie!
- Get him.

615
00:51:28,541 --> 00:51:30,907
Get him, Frankie, cut him!

616
00:51:33,312 --> 00:51:34,939
Ahh!

617
00:51:34,981 --> 00:51:37,449
Shoot, oldest trick
in the book.

618
00:51:37,483 --> 00:51:39,451
Okay, okay.

619
00:51:39,485 --> 00:51:41,715
You hold it wrong, son.
Not like this.

620
00:51:41,754 --> 00:51:43,881
You always
do it like this-- smooth.

621
00:51:43,923 --> 00:51:45,914
- Try it again.
- Come on, Frankie.

622
00:51:45,958 --> 00:51:47,357
Come on, Frankie,
get him!

623
00:51:47,393 --> 00:51:49,452
- Cut him
- Come on. Okay.

624
00:51:49,495 --> 00:51:51,725
- Get him, Frankie, cut him.
- Yeah, you got him!

625
00:51:51,764 --> 00:51:52,753
Frankie, come on!

626
00:51:57,770 --> 00:52:00,034
- Stop, stop, ahh!
- You're breaking his arm!

627
00:52:00,072 --> 00:52:02,097
You three had better
get in there and help him.

628
00:52:16,522 --> 00:52:18,717
Why aren't you
helping him?

629
00:52:18,758 --> 00:52:22,854
Hub always hogs the bad guys.
He's selfish that way.

630
00:52:23,929 --> 00:52:26,124
But there's
four of them!

631
00:52:27,166 --> 00:52:28,656
Three of them.

632
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:35,837
Go on, Hub!
Hey, there's my boy!

633
00:52:35,875 --> 00:52:37,934
Like this, kid?
Pretty good, huh?

634
00:52:37,977 --> 00:52:40,343
- Couldn't you share?
- Nah.

635
00:52:40,379 --> 00:52:42,540
After 40 years,
l'm used to it.

636
00:52:42,581 --> 00:52:44,674
Ahhh!

637
00:52:44,717 --> 00:52:48,949
Besides, right now, l figure
he needs them worse than l do.

638
00:52:51,057 --> 00:52:53,048
Go on, Hub!

639
00:52:53,092 --> 00:52:55,117
This'll hold him though.
This'll hold him.

640
00:52:55,161 --> 00:52:56,185
Please! Please!

641
00:53:12,445 --> 00:53:14,037
They're not back yet, Daddy.

642
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:16,640
l'm sure with Hub
just out of the hospital,

643
00:53:16,682 --> 00:53:18,877
they're taking it slow
and easy on the way home.

644
00:53:18,918 --> 00:53:19,907
Yeah.

645
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:23,454
Oh, l hate this house.
l hate it.

646
00:53:23,489 --> 00:53:25,081
When those two finally
drop dead,

647
00:53:25,124 --> 00:53:27,354
l want you to burn this place
to the ground, Daddy.

648
00:53:27,393 --> 00:53:30,226
Hey, what's that?

649
00:53:30,262 --> 00:53:32,253
Beats me.

650
00:53:32,298 --> 00:53:36,064
- Let's tear it up!
- Yeah.

651
00:53:44,009 --> 00:53:44,998
What is it?

652
00:53:45,044 --> 00:53:47,569
lt's stuffed!

653
00:53:50,683 --> 00:53:53,584
- Mom!
- Mom!

654
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:07,461
- He's alive!
- What? What happened?

655
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,730
l told you about
those lies of yours. No!

656
00:54:12,271 --> 00:54:14,933
Hey, don't step on my shoes!

657
00:54:14,974 --> 00:54:16,737
What have you done
with Uncle Hub?

658
00:54:16,775 --> 00:54:20,370
Kid, get some meat.

659
00:54:20,412 --> 00:54:22,073
Where's Uncle Hub?

660
00:54:24,116 --> 00:54:26,243
Oh, Lord, there's
been an accident.

661
00:54:27,586 --> 00:54:29,884
l wanna go home now.

662
00:54:29,922 --> 00:54:31,822
You're in no shape
to go home now.

663
00:54:31,857 --> 00:54:34,155
lt was a fight. Uncle Hub won.
lt was great.

664
00:54:34,193 --> 00:54:36,627
- Ahh!
- The lion really did try to eat us.

665
00:54:36,662 --> 00:54:39,495
- Shush.
- Jasmine?

666
00:54:39,532 --> 00:54:42,228
Oh Jasmine!
l haven't fed her all day.

667
00:54:42,268 --> 00:54:44,736
l bet she's really hungry.
l got to go feed her.

668
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:47,068
Here, here!

669
00:54:52,645 --> 00:54:54,636
Here you go,
Jasmine.

670
00:54:57,683 --> 00:54:59,412
Jasmine?

671
00:55:04,356 --> 00:55:07,792
- There really is a lion.
- Lion?! You got a lion?

672
00:55:07,826 --> 00:55:11,262
- lt's locked up.
- No it isn't. lt tried to eat us.

673
00:55:11,297 --> 00:55:13,765
- lt really tried to eat us.
- Get the guns!

674
00:55:13,799 --> 00:55:15,562
- Get out of the way.
- Get the guns.

675
00:55:15,601 --> 00:55:17,466
Come here,
come here.

676
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:19,471
Jasmine?

677
00:55:28,847 --> 00:55:31,782
Jasmine? Jasmine?
Jasmine?

678
00:55:31,817 --> 00:55:33,944
Come on. Oh!

679
00:55:37,823 --> 00:55:40,656
Eew, lion spit. No, stop.

680
00:55:40,693 --> 00:55:43,719
Don't shoot,
you'll hit him.

681
00:55:43,762 --> 00:55:45,787
Come on.
Whoa!

682
00:55:51,070 --> 00:55:53,061
They're gone.

683
00:55:53,105 --> 00:55:55,767
- We might be too late.
- Move in.

684
00:55:57,276 --> 00:55:59,506
You stay. Stay.

685
00:56:11,590 --> 00:56:13,455
Jasmine!

686
00:56:14,727 --> 00:56:17,594
Stop, stop.

687
00:56:19,498 --> 00:56:20,487
Attack him!

688
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:31,341
She's feeling
a lot better.

689
00:56:34,546 --> 00:56:36,514
Get off of me!

690
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:39,479
We're leaving.

691
00:56:40,919 --> 00:56:44,013
We are not coming back
until you get rid of that monster.

692
00:56:45,858 --> 00:56:49,123
Well, the lion stays.

693
00:56:50,429 --> 00:56:52,920
All right, that's it.
Come on, Daddy.

694
00:56:52,965 --> 00:56:54,023
Daddy! Come on!

695
00:56:54,066 --> 00:56:56,261
Bye, Uncle Hub.
Bye, Uncle Garth!

696
00:56:56,302 --> 00:56:58,862
Shut up.
Get in the car.

697
00:56:58,904 --> 00:57:01,236
l need a drink bad.
l'm having a bad day.

698
00:57:01,273 --> 00:57:04,071
You boys hungry?

699
00:57:04,109 --> 00:57:07,374
- Wanna stay for supper?
- What are we gonna eat?

700
00:57:07,413 --> 00:57:09,074
Meat.

701
00:57:09,114 --> 00:57:10,945
A lotta meat.

702
00:57:12,117 --> 00:57:14,210
She won't come
out of the cornfield.

703
00:57:14,253 --> 00:57:17,916
This cornfield's the closest thing
to a jungle she's ever seen.

704
00:57:17,956 --> 00:57:20,754
She knows this is where
she belongs.

705
00:57:29,401 --> 00:57:32,268
- l think she's happy.
- l think she is.

706
00:57:35,908 --> 00:57:38,672
What about you?
You happy?

707
00:57:51,824 --> 00:57:54,816
What's he saying to them?

708
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:57,124
He's giving them his
''What every boy needs to know

709
00:57:57,162 --> 00:57:58,754
about being a man'' speech.

710
00:58:00,466 --> 00:58:03,492
A lot of men have heard
that speech over the years.

711
00:58:03,535 --> 00:58:06,629
A lot of men.

712
00:58:06,672 --> 00:58:10,164
- Will he give that speech to me?
- Oh, l guarantee it.

713
00:58:10,209 --> 00:58:12,803
Assuming he's still around,
of course.

714
00:58:17,883 --> 00:58:20,909
Hey, you didn't finish that story
about Uncle Hub and Jasmine.

715
00:58:20,953 --> 00:58:22,614
You don't believe
all this Africa stuff?

716
00:58:22,654 --> 00:58:23,985
lt's a good story.

717
00:58:26,158 --> 00:58:29,924
Well, after he
rescued Jasmine,

718
00:58:29,962 --> 00:58:33,591
several years passed,
wonderful years.

719
00:58:36,568 --> 00:58:39,059
Never were two people
so happy,

720
00:58:39,104 --> 00:58:41,163
so in love.

721
00:58:41,206 --> 00:58:44,141
lt was perfect.

722
00:58:45,177 --> 00:58:47,077
Except for one thing.

723
00:58:47,112 --> 00:58:49,876
- The sheik.
- The sheik.

724
00:58:51,083 --> 00:58:53,881
He hated Hub
for stealing Jasmine,

725
00:58:53,919 --> 00:58:56,581
so he put a price
on Hub's head.

726
00:58:56,622 --> 00:59:01,082
10,000 pieces of gold--
a fortune.

727
00:59:01,126 --> 00:59:04,823
Assassins came
from miles around.

728
00:59:18,644 --> 00:59:20,134
Come on!

729
00:59:20,179 --> 00:59:21,737
He and Jasmine had
to be on guard

730
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:24,544
every minute
of every day.

731
00:59:46,004 --> 00:59:49,064
Hub knew he and Jasmine
couldn't run forever,

732
00:59:49,107 --> 00:59:52,406
that sooner or later
their luck would run out.

733
00:59:55,614 --> 00:59:57,946
There was only
one thing to do.

734
01:00:02,454 --> 01:00:06,823
So one day an assassin led Hub,
bound in chains,

735
01:00:06,859 --> 01:00:08,793
into the sheik's
fortress

736
01:00:08,827 --> 01:00:11,523
to claim his 10,000
pieces of gold.

737
01:00:11,563 --> 01:00:13,053
What?!

738
01:00:14,967 --> 01:00:18,494
They gave the assassin
bags and bags of gold

739
01:00:18,537 --> 01:00:20,129
as the sheik
ordered Hub

740
01:00:20,172 --> 01:00:26,338
down to the notorious
Dungeon of 1,387 Tortures.

741
01:00:29,581 --> 01:00:34,041
What kind of greedy, no-good scum
would turn in Uncle Hub for money?

742
01:00:34,086 --> 01:00:37,487
Well, l would.

743
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:44,155
Ah, it was a trick.

744
01:00:44,196 --> 01:00:47,097
Yeah, it was a trick.

745
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:56,269
ln the dungeon,
l drew my sword...

746
01:01:06,418 --> 01:01:09,319
and single-handedly
slaughtered everyone in there

747
01:01:09,354 --> 01:01:12,050
and freed Hub
without dropping

748
01:01:12,090 --> 01:01:13,614
a single gold coin.

749
01:01:19,464 --> 01:01:21,694
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

750
01:01:21,733 --> 01:01:23,701
You saved Uncle Hub,

751
01:01:23,735 --> 01:01:26,499
all this time carrying
hundreds of pounds of gold?

752
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:31,339
You don't believe l killed
all those men and saved Hub?

753
01:01:34,012 --> 01:01:37,573
Well, Hub might've helped
just a little.

754
01:01:55,133 --> 01:01:57,363
- Uh-oh.
- We were greatly outnumbered.

755
01:01:59,404 --> 01:02:01,372
We fought against
incredible odds.

756
01:02:01,406 --> 01:02:03,670
And when it was over,
we split up.

757
01:02:03,709 --> 01:02:06,337
Each one knew what the other
had to do.

758
01:02:11,316 --> 01:02:14,513
High in his opulent
bedchamber,

759
01:02:14,553 --> 01:02:16,453
the sheik slept.

760
01:02:18,490 --> 01:02:22,586
He awoke with Hub's sword
across his throat.

761
01:02:22,628 --> 01:02:25,222
The sheik was terrified,

762
01:02:25,263 --> 01:02:28,528
but Hub
just lowered his blade.

763
01:02:35,107 --> 01:02:37,632
''Defend yourself!''
Hub cried.

764
01:02:37,676 --> 01:02:40,270
And he threw
the sheik a sword.

765
01:03:08,306 --> 01:03:12,436
The sheik knew that he would
surely die now,

766
01:03:12,477 --> 01:03:15,037
without even the right
to beg for mercy.

767
01:03:26,358 --> 01:03:28,519
But Hub just said,

768
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:33,054
''Twice l have held
your life in my hands,

769
01:03:33,098 --> 01:03:36,363
and twice l have
given it back to you.

770
01:03:36,401 --> 01:03:38,892
The next time...''

771
01:03:38,937 --> 01:03:42,100
...your life is mine.

772
01:03:49,981 --> 01:03:51,676
And from that moment on,

773
01:03:51,717 --> 01:03:54,481
the assassination attempts
stopped.

774
01:03:54,519 --> 01:03:57,545
Some say it was
because the sheik

775
01:03:57,589 --> 01:04:01,184
was afraid that Hub
would return and kill him.

776
01:04:01,226 --> 01:04:04,787
Others said because Hub
had spared his life,

777
01:04:04,830 --> 01:04:09,597
the sheik did the honorable thing
and let his enemy live.

778
01:04:12,537 --> 01:04:15,267
Personally,
l think it's because

779
01:04:15,307 --> 01:04:18,572
the sheik was so damn busy once they
discovered oil in his kingdom.

780
01:04:18,610 --> 01:04:21,636
He became one of the five
richest men in the world.

781
01:04:22,781 --> 01:04:26,649
What?! The bad guy
gets filthy rich?

782
01:04:27,786 --> 01:04:29,686
What the heck kind
of story ends that way?

783
01:04:29,721 --> 01:04:31,780
l just told it
the way it happened.

784
01:04:31,823 --> 01:04:33,791
- Bye.
- So long.

785
01:04:36,628 --> 01:04:38,391
So that's how you got
all your money?

786
01:04:38,430 --> 01:04:40,694
- The gold from the sheik?
- Well..

787
01:04:40,732 --> 01:04:43,030
Yeah.

788
01:04:44,803 --> 01:04:47,431
Those young men'll
be okay now.

789
01:04:47,472 --> 01:04:50,464
- Will you?
- Yeah.

790
01:04:52,310 --> 01:04:55,143
l feel old and worn out.

791
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:57,114
- You've been busy.
- Yeah.

792
01:04:57,149 --> 01:05:00,118
Terrorizing doctors
and nurses,

793
01:05:00,152 --> 01:05:04,054
beating up teenagers,
chasing after lions--

794
01:05:04,089 --> 01:05:06,387
you've had a full day.

795
01:05:08,627 --> 01:05:11,653
Lucky those boys don't know
diddly-squat about fighting.

796
01:05:12,831 --> 01:05:15,425
Won't be long till the kid here
can whup my ass.

797
01:05:18,703 --> 01:05:21,103
Won't be long till l'll be
helpless in a fight.

798
01:05:21,139 --> 01:05:22,800
Useless!

799
01:05:22,841 --> 01:05:24,934
You'll feel better in a day
or two.

800
01:05:28,246 --> 01:05:30,305
Yeah, well...

801
01:05:30,348 --> 01:05:33,408
l'm going to bed.
Good night, kid.

802
01:05:50,135 --> 01:05:52,126
So...

803
01:05:52,170 --> 01:05:54,798
you finally gonna tell me
what happened to Jasmine?

804
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:56,239
- Nope.
- What?!

805
01:05:56,274 --> 01:05:58,765
You wanna know
what happened to Jasmine

806
01:05:58,810 --> 01:06:00,107
you're gonna have
to ask him.

807
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,580
Ask Uncle Hub?

808
01:06:03,615 --> 01:06:06,049
Are you crazy?
Look what happened last time.

809
01:06:06,084 --> 01:06:08,746
l'm tired of doing
all the dirty work around here.

810
01:06:08,787 --> 01:06:10,846
lf you wanna hear
the end of this story,

811
01:06:10,889 --> 01:06:12,356
you're gonna
have to ask him.

812
01:06:42,554 --> 01:06:44,647
- Hub?
- Yeah?

813
01:06:44,689 --> 01:06:47,658
- An airplane?
- Yep, always wanted one.

814
01:06:47,692 --> 01:06:50,252
You always said you'd never set foot
in an airplane.

815
01:06:50,295 --> 01:06:52,889
You don't trust them
to fall right out of the sky.

816
01:06:52,931 --> 01:06:55,331
They're dangerous, all right,
plenty dangerous.

817
01:06:55,367 --> 01:06:57,767
You got a book of instructions
or something?

818
01:06:57,802 --> 01:06:59,360
Yeah, right here.

819
01:06:59,404 --> 01:07:02,168
You don't know
a damn thing about airplanes.

820
01:07:02,207 --> 01:07:04,641
Well, l'm gonna learn,
l tell you.

821
01:07:05,677 --> 01:07:08,441
Aha!
lt says right here,

822
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:10,209
''To climb,
pull back on the stick:

823
01:07:10,248 --> 01:07:12,341
to descend, push forward
on the stick.''

824
01:07:12,384 --> 01:07:15,114
l'll have this thing up
in the air in no time.

825
01:07:15,153 --> 01:07:16,711
Whoo! Damn.

826
01:07:27,232 --> 01:07:29,723
Maybe it's
just a new hobby.

827
01:07:29,768 --> 01:07:32,236
Maybe he doesn't really
mean to...

828
01:07:33,571 --> 01:07:36,267
you know,
do something crazy.

829
01:07:38,276 --> 01:07:40,073
You think so?

830
01:07:46,418 --> 01:07:48,511
You ask him yet?

831
01:07:49,587 --> 01:07:51,384
About Jasmine?

832
01:07:55,794 --> 01:07:57,785
You'd better
make it quick.

833
01:08:59,357 --> 01:09:01,325
What the hell?

834
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:02,986
lt's the middle
of the night.

835
01:09:04,562 --> 01:09:06,621
What's the matter?
What are you doing here?

836
01:09:06,664 --> 01:09:09,724
You got something
to say to me?

837
01:09:09,768 --> 01:09:12,168
Spit it out.

838
01:09:14,205 --> 01:09:16,366
What happened to her,
Uncle Hub?

839
01:09:20,545 --> 01:09:22,775
What happened
to Jasmine?

840
01:09:35,927 --> 01:09:39,658
l have to know.
l have to.

841
01:09:44,135 --> 01:09:46,160
She died.

842
01:09:47,372 --> 01:09:49,636
Died in childbirth.
Her and the baby.

843
01:10:01,252 --> 01:10:03,220
What did you do?

844
01:10:06,458 --> 01:10:10,019
Went back to the only life
l knew-- back to the Legion.

845
01:10:30,181 --> 01:10:34,015
For the next 40 years, there was
always one more war to fight.

846
01:10:35,787 --> 01:10:38,813
Then l got old
and came here.

847
01:10:41,726 --> 01:10:44,251
Here l am.

848
01:10:45,296 --> 01:10:47,787
Here l am.

849
01:10:47,832 --> 01:10:50,323
You cold, son?

850
01:10:50,368 --> 01:10:52,495
You'd better--
here.

851
01:10:52,537 --> 01:10:55,938
You'd better--
you'd better go inside.

852
01:10:57,041 --> 01:11:00,306
Good boy, thank you.
Good boy.

853
01:11:00,345 --> 01:11:02,779
Those stories about Africa...

854
01:11:04,682 --> 01:11:07,150
about you...

855
01:11:07,185 --> 01:11:09,949
they're true,
aren't they?

856
01:11:11,022 --> 01:11:13,855
- Doesn't matter.
- lt does too.

857
01:11:15,527 --> 01:11:19,122
Around my mom all l hear is lies.
l don't know what to believe in.

858
01:11:19,164 --> 01:11:21,462
lf you want to believe in something,
then believe in it.

859
01:11:21,499 --> 01:11:24,832
Just because something isn't true,
no reason you can't believe in it.

860
01:11:27,205 --> 01:11:28,900
All right.

861
01:11:28,940 --> 01:11:30,965
There's a long speech
l give to young men.

862
01:11:31,009 --> 01:11:33,443
Sounds like you need
to hear a piece of it.

863
01:11:33,478 --> 01:11:35,810
Just a piece.

864
01:11:35,847 --> 01:11:40,079
Sometimes the things
that may or may not be true

865
01:11:40,118 --> 01:11:43,747
are the things that a man needs
to believe in the most.

866
01:11:44,889 --> 01:11:48,052
That people are
basically good:

867
01:11:48,092 --> 01:11:50,390
That honor...

868
01:11:50,428 --> 01:11:53,022
courage and virtue
mean everything:

869
01:11:54,299 --> 01:11:57,666
That power and money,
money and power mean nothing;

870
01:11:59,070 --> 01:12:01,937
That good always triumphs
over evil:

871
01:12:03,107 --> 01:12:05,701
And l want you
to remember this, that love...

872
01:12:12,517 --> 01:12:16,180
true love never dies.
You remember that, boy.

873
01:12:19,090 --> 01:12:21,320
You remember that.

874
01:12:21,359 --> 01:12:24,590
Doesn't matter if it's
true or not. You see,

875
01:12:24,629 --> 01:12:27,223
a man should believe
in those things, because...

876
01:12:28,266 --> 01:12:31,167
those are the things
worth believing in.

877
01:12:32,904 --> 01:12:35,202
Got that?

878
01:12:36,374 --> 01:12:38,842
That was a good speech.

879
01:12:38,876 --> 01:12:41,674
Think so? Thanks.

880
01:12:41,713 --> 01:12:44,113
Yeah...

881
01:12:44,148 --> 01:12:46,742
When are you gonna give me
the rest of the speech?

882
01:12:48,152 --> 01:12:50,552
When you're almost a man.

883
01:12:50,588 --> 01:12:53,386
- You promise?
- Wait one minute here. Wait--

884
01:12:53,424 --> 01:12:57,155
l can't be a good man until you give me
the rest of the speech, right?

885
01:12:57,195 --> 01:13:00,392
You need to stick around until l'm
old enough to hear the whole thing.

886
01:13:00,431 --> 01:13:02,991
- l see what you're trying to pull.
- You have to stick around

887
01:13:03,034 --> 01:13:04,934
- until l'm old enough--
- l'll write it down.

888
01:13:04,969 --> 01:13:07,460
No! l want you
to give me the speech!

889
01:13:07,505 --> 01:13:09,871
You won't be
living here then.

890
01:13:09,907 --> 01:13:13,434
You're my uncle. l need you to stick
around and be my uncle.

891
01:13:16,214 --> 01:13:18,011
What about Uncle Garth?

892
01:13:19,350 --> 01:13:21,409
He needs you.

893
01:13:21,452 --> 01:13:24,478
W-what about the dogs
and the pig,

894
01:13:24,522 --> 01:13:27,184
and the lion?
We all need you. l need you.

895
01:13:27,225 --> 01:13:29,216
- No, you're just being silly.
- No, it's true!

896
01:13:29,260 --> 01:13:31,194
- You're being silly.
- lt's true!

897
01:13:34,265 --> 01:13:37,359
l know you miss Jasmine
an awful, awful lot.

898
01:13:39,170 --> 01:13:41,638
But if you go,

899
01:13:42,674 --> 01:13:45,700
we'll miss you
just as much.

900
01:13:47,278 --> 01:13:49,712
lt's true.

901
01:13:56,621 --> 01:13:58,748
All right, damn it,
you win.

902
01:13:58,790 --> 01:14:01,759
l'll stick around
and be your damn uncle.

903
01:14:01,793 --> 01:14:05,058
Don't expect me
to be happy about it.

904
01:14:09,834 --> 01:14:12,564
All right? Deal?

905
01:14:13,738 --> 01:14:16,104
Oh-hh!

906
01:14:17,141 --> 01:14:20,235
Ohh, ohh.

907
01:14:20,278 --> 01:14:22,178
You're a good boy.

908
01:14:25,717 --> 01:14:28,845
You're a good boy.
You're a good boy.

909
01:15:09,227 --> 01:15:10,922
Walter, Walter!

910
01:15:10,962 --> 01:15:12,987
Get ready. Walter!

911
01:17:39,310 --> 01:17:41,437
This money
look stolen to you?

912
01:18:15,746 --> 01:18:18,010
♫ Try to help you ♫

913
01:18:18,049 --> 01:18:21,576
♫ l can't do it
all by myself... ♫

914
01:18:24,422 --> 01:18:27,357
♫ Try to help you ♫

915
01:18:27,391 --> 01:18:30,019
♫ l can't do it
all by myself. ♫

916
01:18:37,068 --> 01:18:40,196
Oh, honey,
you're so funny.

917
01:18:40,237 --> 01:18:42,068
No!

918
01:18:42,106 --> 01:18:44,370
- Whoop!
- Oh!

919
01:18:44,408 --> 01:18:46,239
Shh, quiet!

920
01:18:49,580 --> 01:18:52,242
- Mom!
- Hi, honey.

921
01:18:54,118 --> 01:18:57,110
Walter, Walter,
this is Stan.

922
01:18:57,154 --> 01:18:59,384
l've heard a lot
about you, Walter.

923
01:18:59,423 --> 01:19:01,482
Your uncles
still sleeping?

924
01:19:01,525 --> 01:19:03,083
Best not
wake 'em up.

925
01:19:03,127 --> 01:19:05,061
Shh, come on.
Wanna go sit down?

926
01:19:06,764 --> 01:19:09,324
You got so big.

927
01:19:12,937 --> 01:19:16,236
So Stan here
is a detective.

928
01:19:16,273 --> 01:19:19,265
A real private eye
just like in the movies.

929
01:19:19,310 --> 01:19:21,403
- Wow, really?
- Sure, sure.

930
01:19:21,445 --> 01:19:23,572
You wanna see my badge?

931
01:19:23,614 --> 01:19:25,741
Stan works in Las Vegas.
How about that?

932
01:19:29,020 --> 01:19:32,114
- What about court reporting school?
- Oh, l had to quit.

933
01:19:32,156 --> 01:19:35,125
Stan wants me to stay home
and be a wife and mother.

934
01:19:35,159 --> 01:19:36,786
Won't that be wonderful?

935
01:19:38,929 --> 01:19:42,888
l bet you found out where
your uncles hid all that money, huh?

936
01:19:46,037 --> 01:19:47,231
Why do you want to know?

937
01:19:48,706 --> 01:19:51,573
Walt, your uncles
match the description

938
01:19:51,609 --> 01:19:54,100
of two bank robbers
from the '20s and '30s.

939
01:19:54,145 --> 01:19:56,670
- No, you're wrong.
- When Mae told me about them,

940
01:19:56,714 --> 01:19:58,909
l got copies of the reports
and showed them to her.

941
01:19:58,949 --> 01:19:59,938
lt's them, honey.

942
01:20:01,686 --> 01:20:04,154
They used shotguns.
They wore disguises.

943
01:20:04,188 --> 01:20:07,419
They stole all that money.
And they shot people--

944
01:20:07,458 --> 01:20:08,925
innocent people.

945
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:12,224
No, not them.
lt can't be.

946
01:20:12,263 --> 01:20:14,925
Stan knows what he's
talking about, honey.

947
01:20:14,965 --> 01:20:16,865
What about Jasmine?

948
01:20:16,901 --> 01:20:18,960
She and Uncle Hub
were in love. They--

949
01:20:19,003 --> 01:20:21,699
- l have her picture.
- Honey, wasn't Jasmine

950
01:20:21,739 --> 01:20:24,105
the woman who was driving
the getaway car?

951
01:20:24,141 --> 01:20:27,110
- Oh, right.
- Oh, Jasmine...

952
01:20:27,144 --> 01:20:29,612
she was wounded.

953
01:20:29,647 --> 01:20:32,616
And they just
drove off...

954
01:20:33,751 --> 01:20:35,946
and left her for dead.

955
01:20:38,422 --> 01:20:40,219
l know this hurts, son.

956
01:20:42,593 --> 01:20:45,653
But they're criminals,
and they lied to you.

957
01:20:45,696 --> 01:20:48,665
My poor baby!

958
01:20:48,699 --> 01:20:51,827
Oh, in the arms
of vicious criminals.

959
01:20:51,869 --> 01:20:54,099
We came just as soon
as we found out.

960
01:20:54,138 --> 01:20:56,163
We've come
to take you away.

961
01:20:56,207 --> 01:20:58,402
Now, l want you to tell Stan
where the money is,

962
01:20:58,442 --> 01:21:00,137
then we'll
go pack your things, okay?

963
01:21:04,281 --> 01:21:06,875
Why do you need to know
where the money is?

964
01:21:06,917 --> 01:21:08,578
Look at me, son.

965
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:11,713
Because it doesn't
belong to them.

966
01:21:11,756 --> 01:21:14,691
lt's stolen.

967
01:21:14,725 --> 01:21:18,183
Why, it's probably hidden
right outside here somewhere, right?

968
01:21:18,229 --> 01:21:20,060
Close by?

969
01:21:23,601 --> 01:21:26,627
l'll tell you what, why don't we
take a little walk, huh?

970
01:21:26,670 --> 01:21:28,763
Show us around the place.
What do you say?

971
01:21:28,806 --> 01:21:29,795
Let's go.

972
01:21:34,779 --> 01:21:38,306
Well, Walt, your mother
and l found a nice house.

973
01:21:38,349 --> 01:21:40,943
Don't have enough money
for the down payment though.

974
01:21:40,985 --> 01:21:44,079
We could always turn your uncles in
for the reward money,

975
01:21:44,121 --> 01:21:45,315
but they'd go to jail.

976
01:21:45,356 --> 01:21:47,017
Since all that money's
stolen, honey,

977
01:21:47,057 --> 01:21:49,423
we got a right to it
just as much as they do.

978
01:21:49,460 --> 01:21:51,826
We'll have a nice family
and nobody gets hurt.

979
01:21:51,862 --> 01:21:55,821
lsn't it wonderful, Walter?
lt's what we always wanted.

980
01:21:55,866 --> 01:21:57,493
So where is it?

981
01:21:57,535 --> 01:21:59,332
They're old, they're gonna
die soon anyway.

982
01:21:59,370 --> 01:22:01,270
You want Uncle Sam to end up
with all that dough?

983
01:22:01,305 --> 01:22:03,330
Just tell us.

984
01:22:12,917 --> 01:22:16,148
Hub and Garth didn't rob any banks.
They were in Africa.

985
01:22:16,187 --> 01:22:18,655
Africa!
Oh, Walter, be serious.

986
01:22:18,689 --> 01:22:21,249
Really! They were shanghaied
into the Foreign Legion,

987
01:22:21,292 --> 01:22:24,284
and had adventures for 40 years.
They couldn't have robbed any banks!

988
01:22:24,328 --> 01:22:26,296
Come on, pal.
You don't believe all that, do you?

989
01:22:26,330 --> 01:22:29,629
- Sure, l do!
- You?! Mr. Doubting Thomas?

990
01:22:29,667 --> 01:22:33,626
Here Stan's got actual evidence
and you believe that Africa crap?!

991
01:22:35,973 --> 01:22:37,770
Yes. Yes, l do.

992
01:22:39,577 --> 01:22:41,772
Mae, you should go wait
on the porch.

993
01:22:41,812 --> 01:22:44,042
We're gonna have a little chat,
man to man.

994
01:22:44,081 --> 01:22:46,549
Why don't we talk in the barn?
What do you say?

995
01:22:58,395 --> 01:23:00,329
Come on!

996
01:23:01,365 --> 01:23:03,492
Getting warmer? Huh?

997
01:23:05,569 --> 01:23:07,332
No, let go!

998
01:23:10,708 --> 01:23:12,938
Let's you and me
get something straight.

999
01:23:12,977 --> 01:23:15,969
We can be friends
or we can be enemies.

1000
01:23:16,013 --> 01:23:17,913
l've had a run
of crummy luck lately.

1001
01:23:17,948 --> 01:23:20,883
l know some bad people who want
to cause a lot of trouble for me.

1002
01:23:20,918 --> 01:23:23,614
l need that money
and l know it's close.

1003
01:23:24,688 --> 01:23:28,215
l'll be damned if some snot-nosed kid
is gonna stand in my way.

1004
01:23:28,259 --> 01:23:30,693
So what's
it gonna be, pal?

1005
01:23:30,728 --> 01:23:33,959
Friends or enemies?

1006
01:23:42,439 --> 01:23:44,873
Defend yourself.

1007
01:23:44,909 --> 01:23:46,342
Huh?

1008
01:23:59,924 --> 01:24:02,392
Where is it?!

1009
01:24:02,426 --> 01:24:04,053
Where's the money?
Where is it?

1010
01:24:06,163 --> 01:24:08,256
Where is it?

1011
01:24:08,299 --> 01:24:10,597
Where is it?

1012
01:24:10,634 --> 01:24:12,898
Tell me where it is!

1013
01:24:14,471 --> 01:24:15,904
Tell me where it is!

1014
01:24:16,941 --> 01:24:18,169
Where is it?!

1015
01:24:29,086 --> 01:24:31,554
l heard some noise.

1016
01:24:32,556 --> 01:24:34,251
Oh God!

1017
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:37,749
Jasmine?

1018
01:24:41,966 --> 01:24:47,029
Oh my goodness!
Oh my goodness! Stan!

1019
01:24:47,071 --> 01:24:48,538
lt's dead.

1020
01:24:48,572 --> 01:24:51,200
Oh my God, he's dead!
Stan's dead!

1021
01:24:51,241 --> 01:24:53,072
No, he'll live.
l'm talking about the lion.

1022
01:24:53,110 --> 01:24:54,771
Oh!

1023
01:24:54,812 --> 01:24:57,906
We have to get him to the hospital.
Mae, get your car.

1024
01:24:57,948 --> 01:24:59,882
- l can't, l can't!
- Mae, your car!

1025
01:24:59,917 --> 01:25:02,477
- Get it, get it!
- Okay, okay.

1026
01:25:02,519 --> 01:25:04,885
- Let's get this lion off him.
- Okay.

1027
01:25:08,726 --> 01:25:10,591
This man's
gonna need some stitches.

1028
01:25:10,627 --> 01:25:12,561
A lotta damn stitches.

1029
01:25:12,596 --> 01:25:14,996
What happened to her?

1030
01:25:15,032 --> 01:25:18,991
lt looks like her heart gave out
in all the excitement.

1031
01:25:19,036 --> 01:25:21,561
- Yeah.
- She was plenty old, you know?

1032
01:25:24,041 --> 01:25:25,474
Look--

1033
01:25:26,910 --> 01:25:28,673
l think she's smiling.

1034
01:25:28,712 --> 01:25:32,648
Yeah.
l guess she died happy.

1035
01:25:34,485 --> 01:25:36,851
She died with her boots on,
that's the main thing.

1036
01:25:36,887 --> 01:25:39,412
Protecting her cub.

1037
01:25:45,162 --> 01:25:48,256
She was a real lion,
wasn't she?

1038
01:25:48,298 --> 01:25:49,993
There at the end.

1039
01:25:51,268 --> 01:25:52,758
Sure.

1040
01:25:52,803 --> 01:25:55,135
A real jungle lion.

1041
01:25:57,808 --> 01:26:00,242
A real Africa lion.

1042
01:26:25,069 --> 01:26:27,333
You finished packing?

1043
01:26:30,641 --> 01:26:33,371
Your momma's gonna be back
from the hospital soon.

1044
01:26:33,410 --> 01:26:36,971
You can wait for her
on the front porch.

1045
01:26:56,867 --> 01:26:58,732
Stay right here.

1046
01:26:58,769 --> 01:27:00,828
Don't you move
a muscle.

1047
01:27:05,109 --> 01:27:08,636
So you all packed?
Where's your suitcase?

1048
01:27:09,780 --> 01:27:11,077
Don't be fresh.

1049
01:27:12,616 --> 01:27:15,915
- Upstairs in my room.
- Well, let's go get it.

1050
01:27:25,429 --> 01:27:27,897
Howdy, Stan.

1051
01:27:30,934 --> 01:27:33,300
You know,
you're lucky, Stan.

1052
01:27:33,337 --> 01:27:35,771
Lucky that lion got to you
before we did.

1053
01:27:38,642 --> 01:27:41,076
l wonder what your uncles
are saying to Stan.

1054
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:46,407
Probably their ''What every boy needs
to know about being a man'' speech.

1055
01:27:46,450 --> 01:27:50,386
Well, l'm glad to see
they're making friends.

1056
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:53,617
So you all set?

1057
01:27:55,359 --> 01:27:57,224
Let's go.

1058
01:27:57,261 --> 01:28:01,925
To make a long story short, Stan,
you and me, we can be friends...

1059
01:28:02,966 --> 01:28:06,094
or we can be enemies.

1060
01:28:08,372 --> 01:28:11,739
Well, boys, l hope Walter
wasn't too much trouble.

1061
01:28:11,775 --> 01:28:14,676
- We managed.
- What's gonna happen to him?

1062
01:28:14,711 --> 01:28:17,544
A man like that's got
no business being around your boy.

1063
01:28:17,581 --> 01:28:21,278
Well, of course not.
What kind of a mother would l be?

1064
01:28:21,318 --> 01:28:23,252
l'm gonna drop him off
in Las Vegas.

1065
01:28:35,933 --> 01:28:39,232
l-- l'll be back
for the...

1066
01:28:39,269 --> 01:28:41,931
rest of that speech if...

1067
01:28:43,407 --> 01:28:45,671
l'll be here.

1068
01:28:53,383 --> 01:28:55,214
Good boy.

1069
01:29:01,792 --> 01:29:03,987
Thanks for the s-stories

1070
01:29:04,027 --> 01:29:07,053
and everything.
lt-- it--

1071
01:29:07,097 --> 01:29:09,588
it meant an--

1072
01:29:09,633 --> 01:29:12,568
an awful, awful lot.

1073
01:29:14,638 --> 01:29:16,503
l'm glad.

1074
01:29:31,822 --> 01:29:34,916
Well, come on, honey.
We're burning daylight.

1075
01:30:10,527 --> 01:30:12,495
Damn.

1076
01:30:12,529 --> 01:30:15,521
She doesn't deserve
that kid.

1077
01:30:15,565 --> 01:30:17,795
Maybe we should
get a lawyer.

1078
01:30:17,834 --> 01:30:20,166
No judge is gonna take a child
away from its mother

1079
01:30:20,203 --> 01:30:23,070
and give it to two old
bachelor uncles.

1080
01:30:23,106 --> 01:30:26,234
Maybe she'll sell him to us.
How much money we got?

1081
01:30:26,276 --> 01:30:28,073
Hub...

1082
01:30:28,111 --> 01:30:31,774
there's nothing we can do.
He's gone.

1083
01:31:07,217 --> 01:31:09,208
So where are we going?

1084
01:31:09,252 --> 01:31:12,551
l told you, Las Vegas.

1085
01:31:12,589 --> 01:31:16,150
l mean after.
After we drop Stan off.

1086
01:31:16,193 --> 01:31:20,186
Well, honey, Stan's gonna need
a lot of looking after.

1087
01:31:34,411 --> 01:31:36,140
Walter!

1088
01:31:37,714 --> 01:31:39,011
What are you doing?!

1089
01:31:41,551 --> 01:31:43,314
Oh my God!

1090
01:31:49,359 --> 01:31:52,624
Walter! Walter!

1091
01:31:53,730 --> 01:31:56,563
Walter, stop!

1092
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:58,625
Stop right there!

1093
01:31:59,669 --> 01:32:01,500
What's gotten into you?

1094
01:32:03,006 --> 01:32:07,807
Oh, honey, are you all right?
You gave me a heart attack.

1095
01:32:07,844 --> 01:32:10,836
You're still marrying him
after everything.

1096
01:32:10,881 --> 01:32:12,508
Oh, he's not so bad.

1097
01:32:12,549 --> 01:32:15,109
A little rough around the edges,
but he can change.

1098
01:32:15,152 --> 01:32:16,779
Mom!

1099
01:32:18,355 --> 01:32:20,323
He says he loves me.

1100
01:32:20,357 --> 01:32:23,952
- Has he hit you yet?
- Mind your own business!

1101
01:32:26,596 --> 01:32:29,895
You always think a new boyfriend
solves everything,

1102
01:32:29,933 --> 01:32:32,993
but you always pick losers,
and he's the worst of them all.

1103
01:32:34,938 --> 01:32:39,170
Walter, l had no choice.

1104
01:32:41,878 --> 01:32:43,743
Maybe you don't.

1105
01:32:45,882 --> 01:32:47,611
What?

1106
01:32:51,855 --> 01:32:54,881
- Mom?
- What?

1107
01:32:59,996 --> 01:33:02,760
Do something for me.

1108
01:33:02,799 --> 01:33:05,290
For once.

1109
01:33:07,771 --> 01:33:10,740
Do something
that's best for me.

1110
01:33:10,774 --> 01:33:12,799
Okay?

1111
01:33:54,851 --> 01:33:58,810
Salesmen ought to be here
in two, three hours.

1112
01:33:58,855 --> 01:34:01,653
- Whoop-de-doo.
- Uh-huh.

1113
01:34:10,333 --> 01:34:11,766
Lookie yonder.

1114
01:34:49,906 --> 01:34:52,067
Okay,
if l'm gonna live here,

1115
01:34:52,108 --> 01:34:54,099
there's gonna be
some conditions.

1116
01:34:54,144 --> 01:34:56,942
Conditions?

1117
01:34:56,980 --> 01:34:59,039
One, you two
gotta stick around

1118
01:34:59,082 --> 01:35:01,209
until l'm through
with high school at least,

1119
01:35:01,251 --> 01:35:02,775
preferably college.

1120
01:35:02,819 --> 01:35:04,878
You both
got responsibilities now--

1121
01:35:04,921 --> 01:35:07,685
PTA, Boy Scouts,
Little League,

1122
01:35:07,724 --> 01:35:09,589
the works.

1123
01:35:09,626 --> 01:35:11,651
Sounds like we don't have
much choice.

1124
01:35:12,963 --> 01:35:16,922
Two, you both gotta take
better care of yourselves.

1125
01:35:16,967 --> 01:35:20,130
More vegetables, less meat.

1126
01:35:20,170 --> 01:35:23,765
l wonder if traveling salesmen
sell school supplies?

1127
01:35:23,807 --> 01:35:25,604
And three,

1128
01:35:25,642 --> 01:35:28,042
no more
dangerous stuff.

1129
01:35:28,078 --> 01:35:30,478
No fighting teenagers,
no airplanes--

1130
01:35:30,513 --> 01:35:32,105
Now wait one minute--

1131
01:35:32,148 --> 01:35:33,843
At least till l'm through
with college.

1132
01:35:33,883 --> 01:35:36,147
- Maybe longer.
- What do you expect us to die of?

1133
01:35:36,186 --> 01:35:37,915
Old age?

1134
01:35:45,662 --> 01:35:47,721
Well...

1135
01:35:51,001 --> 01:35:53,231
welcome home.

1136
01:36:37,147 --> 01:36:39,240
- Hello?
- Walter?

1137
01:36:39,282 --> 01:36:42,217
- Yes?
- This is Sheriff Grady.

1138
01:36:42,252 --> 01:36:44,584
l'm afraid l have
some bad news for you.

1139
01:36:44,621 --> 01:36:47,146
lt's about
your two uncles.

1140
01:36:47,190 --> 01:36:49,954
l'm sorry,
they passed away.

1141
01:36:49,993 --> 01:36:52,928
There was an accident...

1142
01:36:52,962 --> 01:36:55,556
and it's a blessing
that they didn't suffer.

1143
01:36:55,598 --> 01:36:59,557
lt's a blessing too,
in a way, that they went together.

1144
01:36:59,602 --> 01:37:01,467
You understand.

1145
01:37:01,504 --> 01:37:04,405
l'm over here
at your uncles' place now.

1146
01:37:04,441 --> 01:37:06,807
You need to come on
over here.

1147
01:37:06,843 --> 01:37:08,708
You need to see this
for yourself.

1148
01:38:14,978 --> 01:38:17,776
- Walter?
- How you doing?

1149
01:38:17,814 --> 01:38:19,645
All right.

1150
01:38:26,122 --> 01:38:28,113
Best l can figure,
they were trying to fly

1151
01:38:28,158 --> 01:38:30,353
through that barn
upside down.

1152
01:38:34,197 --> 01:38:37,758
Had a bunch of reporters
out here earlier, even CNN.

1153
01:38:37,801 --> 01:38:40,702
l guess any time a biplane...

1154
01:38:40,737 --> 01:38:43,672
from the First World War
crashes doing acrobatics,

1155
01:38:43,706 --> 01:38:46,004
being flown by two
90-year-old men--

1156
01:38:46,042 --> 01:38:48,602
neither one of them
with pilot's licenses--

1157
01:38:48,645 --> 01:38:51,045
well...

1158
01:38:52,215 --> 01:38:55,150
well, they had a good long run,
both of them.

1159
01:38:55,185 --> 01:38:58,450
They went out
with their boots on.

1160
01:39:02,125 --> 01:39:05,492
Here.
l found their will.

1161
01:39:14,070 --> 01:39:15,901
''The kid gets it all.

1162
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:20,432
Just plant us
in the damn garden...

1163
01:39:21,644 --> 01:39:23,874
with the stupid lion.''

1164
01:39:41,898 --> 01:39:43,991
Hey!

1165
01:39:44,033 --> 01:39:46,524
We've got some company.

1166
01:40:09,525 --> 01:40:11,755
This is it.

1167
01:40:11,794 --> 01:40:13,056
This is where
they lived.

1168
01:40:15,298 --> 01:40:17,061
lt's okay.
Come here, buddy.

1169
01:40:17,100 --> 01:40:20,331
Come here.
Look at this.

1170
01:40:20,370 --> 01:40:22,497
Look at this.

1171
01:40:24,240 --> 01:40:26,265
Forgive me.

1172
01:40:26,309 --> 01:40:29,107
We were in Houston when we heard
their names on the news,

1173
01:40:29,145 --> 01:40:32,512
and, well,
we just had to come.

1174
01:40:32,548 --> 01:40:35,517
When l was a boy,
my grandfather told me such stories.

1175
01:40:35,551 --> 01:40:39,043
- Your grandfather?
- A very wealthy sheik.

1176
01:40:39,088 --> 01:40:42,888
He used to love to tell me
stories about his wild youth.

1177
01:40:42,926 --> 01:40:46,726
Amazing, unbelievable stories
all about two brothers,

1178
01:40:46,763 --> 01:40:48,560
Hub and Garth McCann,

1179
01:40:48,598 --> 01:40:52,193
the most valiant
and brave men, huh?

1180
01:40:52,235 --> 01:40:55,432
He called them his
''most honored adversaries.''

1181
01:40:55,471 --> 01:40:57,735
''The only men who ever
outsmarted me.''

1182
01:40:59,175 --> 01:41:00,665
Wait, so you--

1183
01:41:02,078 --> 01:41:03,943
you knew these two men?

1184
01:41:05,148 --> 01:41:07,412
They-- they raised me.

1185
01:41:07,450 --> 01:41:09,384
lt's an honor.

1186
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:13,518
- Nice to meet you.
- lt's nice to meet you.

1187
01:41:13,556 --> 01:41:15,456
Wow.

1188
01:41:17,827 --> 01:41:19,818
Aha.

1189
01:41:19,862 --> 01:41:22,262
l see they spent
my grandfather's gold wisely.

1190
01:41:22,298 --> 01:41:23,595
Yeah.

1191
01:41:26,436 --> 01:41:29,735
Well, there was this one
traveling salesman.

1192
01:41:31,941 --> 01:41:33,306
So...

1193
01:41:33,343 --> 01:41:36,312
the two men from great
grandfather's stories,

1194
01:41:36,346 --> 01:41:37,472
they really lived?

1195
01:41:40,583 --> 01:41:42,676
Yeah...

1196
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:46,811
they really lived.
