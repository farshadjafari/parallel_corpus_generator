00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,308
[ Boy ]
Jud.

2
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:00,893
[ Jud ]
What?

3
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:03,688
[ Boy ]
Tha'd better get up.

4
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:14,908
The alarm's gone off, tha knows.

5
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:16,992
[ Jud ]
You think I don't know?

6
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:23,040
- Jud.
- What?

7
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,835
- Tha'll be late!
- Shut it.

8
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,588
- Clock's not fast.
- I said shut it.

9
00:01:29,674 --> 00:01:32,174
Get out! That hurts!

10
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:35,262
- Well, shut it then.
- I'll tell me mum on thee.

11
00:01:35,346 --> 00:01:37,430
[ Jud ]
Shut your stinkin' hole.

12
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,106
Christ.

13
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:52,987
- Set clock on for me. For 7:00.
- [ Jud ] Set it yourself.

14
00:01:53,072 --> 00:01:54,864
Go on. Tha are up.

15
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:00,328
Hands off cocks, on socks.

16
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:06,251
You rotten sod!
Just because you have to get up!

17
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,627
Another few weeks, lad,
tha'll be getting up with me.

18
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:11,088
- I'll not.
- Won't tha?

19
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:14,259
- No, 'cause I'm not gonna work down pit.
- Where's ya gonna work then?

20
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:16,635
I don't know,
but I'm not gonna work down pit.

21
00:02:16,721 --> 00:02:19,264
No.
And have I to tell thee why?

22
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:23,018
For one thing, tha's to be able to read
and write before they set thee on.

23
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:26,021
And for another, they won't trouble
with a little twat like thee.

24
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:29,106
- Switch the light out then.
- Switch it out yourself.

25
00:03:57,947 --> 00:04:00,073
Me billicking bike!

26
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:41,298
- [ Man ] I thought you weren't coming.
- Why? I'm not late, am I?

27
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,759
Very near.

28
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:46,512
- I nearly was though.
- What do you mean?

29
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,682
Our Jud, he's taken the bike.

30
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,893
- What you gonna do then?
- Walk it.

31
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:54,353
Walk it? How long do you
think that's gonna take?

32
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,355
- It'll not take me long.
- Hey.

33
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,774
There's a waiting list a mile long
for that job of yours.

34
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:02,694
Good lads, too, most of 'em.
From up Firs Hill, round there.

35
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,531
I haven't let you down, have I?

36
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:06,425
- Ah, morning. Morning.
- [ Man ] Morning, sir.

37
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,548
Not very promising again.

38
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,576
A bit on the nippy side
as well this morning.

39
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,454
<i>- Aye.
- 20 Players tipped, please.</i>

40
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,163
Oh, right.

41
00:06:13,249 --> 00:06:14,721
I've not got 20.
Will two 10's do?

42
00:06:14,733 --> 00:06:16,528
Yes. That'll be quite
all right, thank you.

43
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,588
- Ah, thank you.
- Right.

44
00:06:20,673 --> 00:06:22,339
- Cheerio.
- Cheerio. Good morning, sir.

45
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:23,841
Good morning.

46
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,509
You know what they
said when I took you on?

47
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:26,132
What?

48
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,240
They said, "You'll have to keep
your eyes open now, you know.

49
00:06:28,264 --> 00:06:29,971
They're all alike in that
state up there. He'll

50
00:06:29,983 --> 00:06:31,451
take your breath if
you're not careful".

51
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:33,694
I haven't taken nowt
of yours yet, have I?

52
00:06:33,706 --> 00:06:36,187
Well, I haven't given
you a chance, that's why.

53
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:39,274
You don't have to.
I - I haven't been nicking for ages now.

54
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:41,691
Well, come on then. Don't
stand about all day.

55
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:42,702
I'm goin'.

56
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:00,687
- Hey up, young 'un! How thee goin' on?
- Not so bad.

57
00:08:00,773 --> 00:08:03,149
You want to get one of these.
This is better than walkin'.

58
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,692
Ah, only just.
I could go faster on a kid's scooter.

59
00:08:05,778 --> 00:08:07,819
- Well, tha knows what I always say.
- What?

60
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,572
Third-class ridin's
better than first-class walkin' any day.

61
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:12,992
You call that third-class ridin'?
In that ramshack?

62
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:16,036
What you mean, ramshack?
This is one of best models the dairy's got.

63
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,829
Cheeky young 'un.
See thee tomorrow.

64
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:22,209
- Can only go 20 mile an hour, as it is.
- Yeah? Got too much rattle, thee.

65
00:08:56,412 --> 00:09:00,206
<i>[ Boy's Voice ] "Desperate Dan is stronger
than all, but this opponent makes him fall.</i>

66
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,750
<i>Right!
Where do you want to fight?</i>

67
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:06,962
<i>Right here! Skid. Down I go again!
What's making me fall?</i>

68
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:10,549
<i>Now's my chance to jump on his chest!
Thud!</i>

69
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,884
<i>You won't catch me out
this time, you braggart!</i>

70
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:16,346
<i>A sock in the midriff
will settle your game! Splash!</i>

71
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:18,890
<i>What's this on my face?
Why, it's grease!</i>

72
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,475
<i>Give me that tube back!</i>

73
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:24,897
<i>That's how he kept making me slip! He was
squirting invisible grease under my feet!</i>

74
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,942
<i>You dirty twister!
It's time somebody taught you a lesson!</i>

75
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:30,610
<i>Take that! Crash!</i>

76
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:32,113
<i>Where did he end up?</i>

77
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:35,700
<i>In the middle of next week, Uncle Dan!"</i>

78
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,677
- Evenin'.
- I told you it wouldn't take me long.

79
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,304
What did you do? Throw half of 'em
over the gates or something?

80
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,682
No need to.
I know some shortcuts on the way back.

81
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:02,769
I'll bet you do.
Over other folks' property.

82
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,523
How many times do you want tellin'
where to put that bag?

83
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,864
- Time is it?
- Time you were at school.

84
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,365
Is it that late?

85
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,619
I wouldn't be your teacher
for all the coal in Barnsley.

86
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:24,039
Oh, Mr. Porter!

87
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:27,125
- Watch it, Mr. Porter.
- You clumsy young bugger!

88
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:28,961
What you tryin' to do? Kill me?

89
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:30,712
[ Boy ]
I lost me balance.

90
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:36,177
I wouldn't put it past you either.
I fair felt me heart go then.

91
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:40,139
Just sit down here
and relax a couple of minutes.

92
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:42,307
Are you ail right now?

93
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,309
I'm bloody champion.

94
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,187
I'll be off then.

95
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,397
And don't be late tonight.

96
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,485
- Allot?
- Sir.

97
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,986
- Bowser?
- Sir.

98
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:57,823
- Bridges?
- Absent, sir.

99
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:00,618
- Absent. Bridges. Casper?
- Sir.

100
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,327
- Clegg?
- Sir.

101
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:05,331
- Fisher?
- German Bight.

102
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,897
- [ Teacher ] Did you say something?
- Yes, sir. I didn't mean -

103
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:13,297
Stand up, lad.

104
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,508
- What did you say?
- German Bight, sir.

105
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,092
He's daft, sir.

106
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:20,388
- [ Boy ] He's right, sir.
- Is this your ridiculous idea of a joke?

107
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,389
- No, sir.
- Well, what is the idea then?

108
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:24,475
Well, when you said "Fisher," sir -

109
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:27,144
- Well, what about it?
- Just came out. Fisher. German Bight.

110
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:31,315
It's the shipping forecast, sir.
Fisher. German Bight. Cromarty.

111
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,359
I like to hear it every night, sir.

112
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,860
- I like names.
- Huh.

113
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:37,013
And so you thought you'd
enlighten me and the

114
00:11:37,024 --> 00:11:39,240
rest of the class with
your idiotic information?

115
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,062
No, sir.

116
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:42,326
Blurting out and making
a mess of my register.

117
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:45,037
- It just came out, sir.
- And so did you, Casper.

118
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:48,124
Just come out from under a stone.

119
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,922
[ Teacher ]
I said, quiet!

120
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:58,384
Is anyone else absent besides
Bridges and Fisher?

121
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,927
Any girls?

122
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:04,097
Right. Now, then, it's time
we're off to assembly.

123
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:07,100
One row at a time.
This one, stand.

124
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,770
Move forward.

125
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:19,154
Pamela, you're talking.
Cut it out.

126
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:23,826
Hey up, Billy.
What's that mean, Germans bite?

127
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:27,038
- Oh, shut your mouth.

- What time?
- About 6:00.

135
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,217
- Can't.
- Why?

136
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,779
- Takin' girlfriend to Sheffield.
- Excuses!

137
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,804
[ Boy ]
Oh, they're not goin' at 6:00 after all!

138
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,866
What the bloody hell do you want
at this time in the morning?

139
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,870
- Get your Mac up.
- Hey, he's fast asleep.

140
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:09,871
I can't get him up at this time.

141
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,917
- Go get him up for me.
- His father, he'll be down to ya!

142
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,543
I'm not bothered about his father.
I want your MacDowell.

143
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:27,097
- Bugger off, you little sod!
- Get him up, see ya!

144
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:29,642
I'm not gettin' him up.
It's too early for him.

145
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:32,038
- He said I had to get him up.
- He's fast asleep and he's not goin'.

146
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:34,062
So just get off with ya.

- Now, then. What's tha doin'?
- Nowt.

Well, bugger off then.
Don't you know it's private property?

149
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:23,500
- Can I get up to that kestrel's nest?
- What kestrel's nest?

150
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:24,303
Up wall.

151
00:17:24,315 --> 00:17:26,502
There's no nest up
there, so off tha goes.

152
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,963
There is.
I've seen 'em come out.

153
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,761
What will tha do when tha gets up there?
Take all its eggs?

154
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:36,520
There ain't any eggs.
There are young 'uns.

155

Well, there's nowt to
go up for then, is there?

156
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:41,894
Can I come to the bottom then?
Never seen a kestrel's nest before.

157
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,686
Come on then.

158
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,570
<i>- There it is.
- Aye.</i>

159
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:55,199
- That big hole.
- It's nested there for donkeys' years now.

160
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:58,576
- Just think. And I never knew.
- No, there's not many that does.

161
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:01,204
Been watching from the wood there.

162
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,958
Goes onto post, then hovers...

163
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,461
then swoops down onto it prey,

Depends what you're

Not a care in t' world.

327
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:06,625
You see, when you've been married once
and you marry a wrong 'un...

328
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:09,461
it makes you a bit apprehensive
to-towards gettin' -

329
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:11,464

'Cause he were never good.

331
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:17,176
But it makes you a bit more wary
about gettin' married again.

332
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:20,240
If she wants to go with a different bloke,
it's not up to me to tell her what to do.

00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:22,891
She's old enough
to know her own mind, isn't she?

I sit and wonder sometimes what he will do.

338
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,113

than what he has.

00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:44,960
We'll pick two teams.
You're the captain.

488
00:41:45,045 --> 00:41:47,755
Right, line up
on the halfway line, quickly.

489
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,250
I'll have first pick. Paget.

490
00:41:49,262 --> 00:41:51,967
That's not fair, sir. You'll
get all t' best players.

491
00:41:52,052 --> 00:41:54,344
Do you wanna play football,
or do you wanna do some maths?

492
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:56,972
- Football, sir.
- Paget then. Come here.

493
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:58,516
- Speed.
- Walker.

494
00:41:58,599 --> 00:41:59,934
- Clark.
- Crossland.

495
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:03,228
- Guthrie.
- Rowe.

496
00:42:03,313 --> 00:42:06,148
- Uh... Clegg.
- Norton.

497
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:09,318
[ Billy ]
Bloody hell, I'm frozen already.

498
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:11,528
- Joyce.
- Birkinshaw.

499
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,905
- Ryder.
- Parker.

500
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:16,367
- Norton.
- [ Boy ] Come on, Parker.

501
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:19,369
[ Coach ] Casper, I've got to have ya.

502
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:22,998
Come on. Don't act.
Come on. Put 'em round your waist.

503
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:24,791
[ Coach ]
Now.

504
00:42:28,922 --> 00:42:32,925
Right, we'll play with the wind,
downhill, this way.

505
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:36,429
- Paget, you're inside right. Come on.
- We'll be out here all day.

506
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,018
Who are you today, sir?
Liverpool?

507
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:46,521
Don't be slack.
Don't you know your club colors?

508
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:48,065
Manchester United strip this.

509
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:50,317
Are you playing Denis Law
again today, sir, or Striker?

510
00:42:50,402 --> 00:42:54,405
No. Charlton today, lad.
All over the field. Too cold for Striker.

511
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:57,407
Course, uh, Charlton's not
as quick on t' turn as Law, is he?

512
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:59,971
- You tryin' to tell me about football?
- No. I'm just telling you that -

513
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,579
- You trying to tell me?
- No, sir.

514
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:04,164
Anyway, Denis Law's in the wash this week.

515
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:10,086
- Nobody's in goal, sir.
- No goalie, sir.

516
00:43:10,172 --> 00:43:12,465
- No goal, sir.
- Who's in the goals?

517
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:13,715
- Casper.
- Casper, sir.

518
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,885
Casper, what position
are you supposed to be playing?

519
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:18,114
[ Billy ] Don't know, sir. Inside left?

520
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:20,847
How can you be inside left
back there, idiot? In the goals.

521
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:24,309
- I can't goal, sir! I don't!
- Now's your chance to learn. In the goals!

522
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:26,061
- [ Boy ] Get out.
- Quick about it.

523
00:43:26,146 --> 00:43:27,438
[ Boy ]
Go on!

524
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:30,106
Tibbutt, we're Manchester United.
Who are you?

525
00:43:30,192 --> 00:43:32,378
Uh, we'll be Spurs, sir.
Then there's no clash of colors.

526
00:43:32,402 --> 00:43:34,612
Right, then, it's Manchester United
versus Spurs...

527
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:38,324
in this important fifth-round cup tie
here at Old Trafford.

528
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:41,744
And it's the fair-haired,
slightly balding Charlton to kick off.

529
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,342
Come on, Speed.

530
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,570
- What you playin' at, lad?
- You kicked it miles away!

531
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:01,722
You should be on the move, lad!
It was at your feet!

532
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:04,057
- Cross it, Ryder. Quickly!
- Come on!

533
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:06,476
Where's the rest of my team?

534
00:44:13,777 --> 00:44:15,735
[ Coach ]
Come on, quickly, Casper.

535
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:19,322
I've never seen such slack work in my life.
I've never seen such slack work in my -

536
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:24,202
- What's that for, sir?
- Slack work, lad. Slack work.

537
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:26,454
Hit that ball up the field, Parker.

538
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,793
Look at this lot.
I have to keep this shirt on and all after.

539
00:44:31,878 --> 00:44:33,711
[ Coach ]
Cross the ball!

540
00:44:33,797 --> 00:44:36,005
And Charlton goes through, and -

541
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,092
Oh, never! Never! Come on!

542
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,971
Penalty!

543
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:43,972
- Never.
- Who do you think you are? Bremner?

544
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:47,559
You tripped on your own feet, sir!

545
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:50,436
- Penalty.
- No, it weren't, sir!

546
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,606
Outside that semicircle.

547
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:59,697
- Shall I take it, sir?
- I take the penalties on this team.

548
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:06,704
No one moves till this ball's kicked.

549
00:45:06,788 --> 00:45:08,289
[ Boy ]
Watch everything, sir.

550
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:12,458
Just watch this, Guthrie.

551
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,210
Right, Clegg?

552
00:45:16,715 --> 00:45:19,300
You moved. You moved.

553
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:22,385
Put it back.

554
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:30,561
Penalty!

555
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:32,896
Behind the 18-yard line.

556
00:45:32,981 --> 00:45:34,231
[ Boy ]
Save it, Cleggy.

557
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:35,867
Sir, why don't you
let Paget kick it?

558
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,835
Tha better save it, Cleggy!
Else I'll drop tha.

559
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,945
- [ Boy ] You got everything!
- Why don't you let Paget kick it, sir?

560
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:43,574
- He moved!
- I didn't move, sir.

561
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:45,742
The referee's decision is final.

562
00:45:49,748 --> 00:45:51,998
[ Boy ]
Let's do it this time, sir.

563
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:57,045
Oh!

564
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:03,927
You should have done it
the first time.

565
00:46:04,012 --> 00:46:07,639
And that, boys,
is how to take a penalty.

566
00:46:07,724 --> 00:46:10,016
Look one way and kick the other.

567
00:46:11,728 --> 00:46:13,646
All right, come on, Tibbutt, lad.

568
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:17,273
And Bobby Charlton has
equalized for Manchester United...

569
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:19,525
and the score is one goal each.

570
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,695
- Aah!
- Get some leg dope!

571
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:26,742
- Did you see that?
- That fat twat!

572
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:28,744
He wants bleedin' milkin'.

573
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:30,746
That big, fat git!

574
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:32,748
[ Coach ]
What did you say?

575
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:34,750
- What did you say?
- Nowt, sir.

576
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:37,293
Right! Get off!
In that changin' room! Get off!

577
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:39,380
- I didn't say nowt, sir.
- Off!

578
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:43,050
I won't tolerate that
on a football pitch.

579
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:45,635
- It's not fair, sir.
- That's our captain, sir.

580
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:48,639
I don't care who he is.
You play this game like gentlemen.

581
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:50,682
Can't play without a captain!

582
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,684
Right inside!

583
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:55,269
He's our captain, sir!

584
00:46:55,355 --> 00:46:57,523
An early bath for you, lad.

585
00:47:00,485 --> 00:47:01,943
I'll bounce the ball up.

586
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:04,382
It's not fair, sir!
They never get sent off!

587
00:47:04,393 --> 00:47:06,155
L shall be up there in a minute!

588
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,742
They never get sent off, sir!

589
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:12,663
Off! Right off!

590
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:19,168
- [ Coach ] Come on, Paget!
- Me! Me! Me!

591
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:22,422
- I got left with the football!
- What do you think you're doing?

592
00:47:23,425 --> 00:47:25,717
Don't know.

593
00:47:25,802 --> 00:47:27,177
What do you mean?

594
00:47:27,262 --> 00:47:28,846
Practicing, sir.

595
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,931
Huh?
Show me what you're doing.

596
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,195
- Our ball!
- Our ball! Our ball!

597
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,239
- Our ball!
- Our ball!

598
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:49,115
- Clegg!
- Clegg!

599
00:47:53,663 --> 00:47:55,621
Come on, Clegg!

600
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,416
Ball! Go on, boy!

601
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:02,628
Casper!

602
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,715
Casper!

603
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:06,759
What do you think you are, lad?
An ape?

604
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:08,188
All he needs now is a banana.

605
00:48:08,201 --> 00:48:10,304
Get down. I'll make you
red-hot in a minute!

606
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,393
Thank you.

607
00:48:17,478 --> 00:48:19,228
Now, for my next trick -

608
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:22,983
[ Coach ] I'll show you a trick! Get back
in that goal! The rest of you, up field!

609
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:29,114
Bloody -

610
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:31,617
- What's up?
- That ball is -

611
00:48:31,701 --> 00:48:35,536
- That ball, it's hard as iron.
- I know. It's like a stone, isn't it?

612
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:40,000
- I'm bloody freezing.
- My feet are like blocks of ice.

613
00:48:40,085 --> 00:48:43,253
Me knees, look at 'em.
They're goin' pale.

614
00:48:43,338 --> 00:48:45,672
Look at t' color.
It's gone white.

615
00:48:45,757 --> 00:48:48,717
Oh, I wish I'd brought a note.

616
00:48:54,099 --> 00:48:55,599
Come on, Danny!

617
00:48:56,643 --> 00:48:58,601
- Goal!
- It's in!

618
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:10,239
Great goal that, sir.

619
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:12,407
I'll give you a "great goal," lad.

620
00:49:12,492 --> 00:49:14,659
Spurs into the sixth round of t' cup!

621
00:49:14,744 --> 00:49:17,264
Sixth round? I'll give you six in the back
in a minute! On your way!

622
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:19,873
- Lost again, sir?
- Fetch my tracksuit.

623
00:49:19,958 --> 00:49:21,750
Better luck next time.

624
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:34,804
- In a hurry, Casper?
- Yes, sir. I have to get home, sir.

625
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:36,931
- Really?
- Yes, sir.

626
00:49:37,016 --> 00:49:39,143
- Forgotten something?
- No, sir.

627
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:41,228
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

628
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:44,731
- What about the showers?
- I've had one, sir.

629
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,945
- You can ask any of 'em, sir.
- I'll just do that.

630
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:54,157
- Have you seen him have a shower?
- No, sir.

631
00:49:54,242 --> 00:49:56,534
- Have you?
- No, sir. I didn't, sir.

632
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:58,286
- Have you?
- No, sir.

633
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:02,583
Have you seen him have a shower?

634
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,668
- Who, sir?
- Casper.

635
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,295
- When, sir?
- Just now.

636
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,755
- Has he had a shower?
- Had a shower, sir?

637
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:13,135
Has Casper had a shower?
What you fooling about at, lad?

638
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:15,929
- Has Casper had a shower?
- I don't think so, sir.

639
00:50:16,014 --> 00:50:19,349
Speed, you fool about any more,
you'll get what Casper just had.

640
00:50:19,434 --> 00:50:23,603
No one's seen you have a shower, Casper,
because you haven't had one.

641
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:25,704
Me mum says I ain't
to have a shower, sir.

642
00:50:25,715 --> 00:50:27,608
Come here, lad.
What's your mother say?

643
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:30,860
I ain't to have a shower, sir.
I've got a cold.

644
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:32,840
Where's your note then?
Let me see your note.

645
00:50:32,853 --> 00:50:34,364
Can I bring it
this afternoon, sir?

646
00:50:34,449 --> 00:50:37,034
That's no good, lad.
I want one now.

647
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:40,454
Any boy wishing to be excused
physical education or showers...

648
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:42,706
must, at the time of the lesson...

649
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:45,391
produce a sealed letter
of explanation signed

650
00:50:45,403 --> 00:50:47,960
by one of his parents
or his legal guardian.

651
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:50,963
- Go on, sir, let me go home.
- You can go, lad.

652
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:53,800
Hey, come here.
When you've had a shower.

653
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:56,887
I haven't a towel, sir.

654
00:50:56,971 --> 00:50:58,722
- Borrow one.
- Nobody'll lend me one.

655
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:01,016
Have a drip-dry then.
Shower. Come on.

656
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:05,938
- Come here, MacDowell.
- Sir?

657
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:07,898
Come here, lad.

658
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:10,067
Come here.

659
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,693
- What's this?
- Our dog did it, sir.

660
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:16,697
<i>- Your dog did it?
- Aye.</i>

661
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:19,784
It bit me, sir.
I fought with it on the rug last night.

662
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:23,914
A dog wearing nylons, lads.

663
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:33,215
Bloody hell.

664
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:41,931
- Still in a hurry, Casper?
- Can I go now, sir?

665
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:43,994
You're not going anywhere
till you've had a proper wash.

666
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:45,936
- I've had one, sir.
- In the shower, lad.

667
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:47,498
- I've been, sir!
- In the shower, lad.

668
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:50,023
- I've got to get home!
- In the shower.

669
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,860
Ryder, Speed, come here.

670
00:51:53,945 --> 00:51:56,028
- Me, sir?
- Yes, you two. Come on.

671
00:51:57,282 --> 00:52:00,199
Want you two to stay here
and see that he doesn't come out.

672
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:01,273
Do what, sir?

673
00:52:01,286 --> 00:52:04,288
Stay there and see that
he doesn't come out.

674
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:16,215
Aah! Sir! It's gone cold!

675
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,552
[ Coach ]
Got a sweat on, Casper?

676
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:21,512
I thought you might need a cooler
after your exertions in goal.

677
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:25,516
It's not right, sir.
I'll catch me death of cold in here.

678
00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:27,393
It's not right.

679
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:30,480
Was it right when
you let that goal in deliberately?

680
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:37,403
- Can't we go for us dinners?
- No, you can't. You can stay there.

681
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:38,905
- We're servers.
- I don't care.

682
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:40,990
They can serve themselves for once.

683
00:52:43,161 --> 00:52:46,079
You shouldn't put me in goal, sir.
You know I'm useless.

684
00:52:46,164 --> 00:52:48,498
[ Coach ]
Now's your chance to learn.

685
00:52:48,583 --> 00:52:52,001
[ Ryder ] Shall we let him out, sir?
He'll catch his death of cold in here.

686
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:53,628
He'll catch pneumonia.

687
00:52:53,713 --> 00:52:55,505
[ Coach ]
I don't care what he gets.

688
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:58,507
If he thinks I'm running my blood
to water for 90 minutes...

689
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:02,512
for him to deliberately throw the game
away, he's got another think coming.

690
00:53:02,597 --> 00:53:05,766
[ Ryder ]
Sir, we're going to miss our dinner.

691
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,976
[ Boy ] Come on, sir! We've
got to go for our dinner.

692
00:53:10,813 --> 00:53:12,396
Look at him!

693
00:53:15,485 --> 00:53:18,737
- [ Coach ] Get down!
- [ Boy ] He looks like a bleedin' snake!

694
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,237
[ Coach ]
Think yourself lucky.

695
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:41,695
Too far is too far.
Hey up, old 'un! How it goin'?

696
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:43,864
- Rough, man. rough.
- Why?

697
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,865
I'd be on top of the world
on a day like today.

698
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,992
Another 10 minutes
I'll be at bottom on it.

699
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:57,668
[ Man ]
Eh?

700
00:54:57,753 --> 00:54:59,420

This morning's reading is taken from
Matthew, Chapter 18, verses 10-14.

713
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:50,239
"Never despise one of these little ones,
I tell you.

714
00:56:50,324 --> 00:56:52,617
They have their guardian angels
in heaven...

715
00:56:52,702 --> 00:56:56,288
who look continually on the face
of my heavenly father.

716
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:58,414
Suppose a man has a hundred sheep.

717
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:02,710
If one of them strays, does he not leave
the other 99 on the hillside...

718
00:57:02,795 --> 00:57:05,255
and go in search of the one
that strayed?

719
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:08,257
And if he should find it, I tell you this:

720
00:57:08,342 --> 00:57:12,887
He is more delighted over that sheep
than over the 99 that never strayed.

721
00:57:12,972 --> 00:57:15,974
In the same way,
it is not your heavenly father's will...

722
00:57:16,057 --> 00:57:18,434
that one of these little ones
should be lost."

723
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:20,436
Here ends this morning's reading.

724
00:57:26,277 --> 00:57:28,360
[ Headmaster ]
Stop! Stop that infernal coughing!

725
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:30,530
Every morning alike!

726
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:33,365
Clear your throats on the way to school,
not here.

727
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:37,996
Sounds more like a dirt track
than an assembly hall.

728
00:57:42,043 --> 00:57:45,170
[ Headmaster ]
Come out! Come out, that boy!

729
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:47,130
Who coughed?

730
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:49,840
Mr. Hesketh, somewhere near you,
I think.

731
00:57:49,925 --> 00:57:51,800
Fetch that boy out!

00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:54,554
MacDowell! It was you.
You were coughing.

733
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:56,347
- It weren't!
- Yes, it was. I heard you.

734
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:58,557
- It weren't, sir.
- Come on, don't argue. We know.

735
00:57:58,643 --> 00:58:01,393
- It weren't me. Honest!
- Come on. Headmaster's study. Come on.

736
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:04,606
[ Headmaster ] MacDowell! I might
have known it! Get to my office!

- It weren't me, sir.
- And heaven help you!

738
00:58:10,362 --> 00:58:12,655
We will now say the Lord's Prayer.

739
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:14,907
Hands together, eyes closed.

<i>Thy will be done - [ Fades ]</i>

00:58:36,972 --> 00:58:37,967
Does he bite then?

747
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:40,349
Fierce. Had a little
kid's hand off nearly.

748
00:58:40,434 --> 00:58:42,851
Had he? My, my, my!

749
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:44,436
What's he fastened on then, wire?

750
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,606
- Aye. It's broke this off and all.
- Oh, dear.

751
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:50,025
- Just darted at the kid and got him.
- Well, I don't know.

752
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:52,112
Is that what you've got
the glove on for?

753
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:55,949
- Yeah. Just in case he gets me.
- Aye. Aye.

754
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,784
- What do you call it?
- Kes.

Kes? Aye.

00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:02,038
He is a nice bird.

00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:07,376

- I don't know, sir.
- I know! You were! You were asleep!

00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:20,347
Why were you asleep,
you irreverent scoundrel?

- I don't know, sir.
- I know why!

763
00:59:22,643 --> 00:59:26,146
You're roaming the streets at night
instead of being home in bed.

764

See me in my office afterwards!
I'll give you something to think about!

765

766
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:35,487
Here are the announcements.

767
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,657
A reminder that
the youth employment officer...

768
00:59:37,742 --> 00:59:40,744
- will be here this afternoon
to meet the Easter leavers.

769
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:42,954
Your parents should have been told.

770
00:59:43,038 --> 00:59:44,706
But if any boy has forgotten...

771
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:47,416
or thinks that his parents may wish
to attend his interview...

772
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:52,880
then he can consult the list on the main
notice board for the approximate times.

773
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:58,844
And finally, for three members
of the smokers' union...

774
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:02,347
caught yesterday
behind the games storeroom...

775
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:06,186
there will be a meeting
with me after assembly...

776
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:10,606
when I will be pleased to see and hear them
pay their dues.

777
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:13,777
He'd better not stick me on it.
I'm fetchin' me father up if he does.

778

What the good of bringing thee father
down here? He don't do nowt when he comes.

- Last time he came, he got stick and all.

Shut up with all that.
I'm sick of hearin' thee.

- Yeah. Weren't they?

What does thou want?

I've got a message for Mr. Gryce
from Mrs. Spooner.

787
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:40,804
- Thou'd better queue then, ain't thou?
- Yeah.

788
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:42,949
It's his favorite trick.
He loves to keep you waiting.

789
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:44,556
Thinks it makes it worse.

790
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:47,226
Yeah. He can keep me till 4:00.
I'm not bothered.

791
01:00:47,311 --> 01:00:50,021
I'd rather have the stick
than do the lessons.

I can't. He'll think
I have smoked as well.

795
01:00:57,987 --> 01:00:59,913
He'll not search thee,
but he'll search us. And

796
01:00:59,925 --> 01:01:01,740
if he finds them on us,
we'll get two extra.

797
01:01:01,826 --> 01:01:04,409
- I don't want 'em.
- Does thou want some fist instead?

798
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:05,994
Are tha gonna take them?

799
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:08,164
Tha'd better, lad,
or thou'll say thee prayers.

800
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:12,751
Okay. But if I get caned,
you'll give me summat.

- Sir, I've got a message -
- Shut up, lad. Don't interrupt.

Now close the door.

01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:07,806
I taught some of your parents -
your father, MacDowell -

816
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:10,976
in the old slum schools in the city...

817
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:14,021
before they built this fine estate...

818
01:02:14,106 --> 01:02:16,815
and this wonderful school.

819
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:19,652
Things are no better now
than they were then.

820
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:23,322
I just can't understand this generation.

821
01:02:23,407 --> 01:02:26,159
I thought I knew something
about young people.

822
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:29,329
I should be able to, you know?
With my experience.

823
01:02:29,413 --> 01:02:31,664
But with you? No.

824
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:36,501
It just seems a complete waste of money
and a waste of time.

825
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:39,422
And it's a waste of time
talking to you now.

826
01:02:39,505 --> 01:02:41,507
Why, you're not even listening,
are you, MacDowell?

827
01:02:41,592 --> 01:02:43,092
- Yes, sir.
- No, you're not!

828
01:02:43,177 --> 01:02:45,376
- Crossland, you're not listening, are you?
- I am, sir.

829
01:02:45,429 --> 01:02:47,492
No, you're not. None
of you are listening!

830
01:02:47,503 --> 01:02:49,724
Look at that glazed
expression on your faces.

831
01:02:49,807 --> 01:02:53,811
You never listen!
Yours is the generation that never listens.

832
01:02:53,896 --> 01:02:56,021
Because we can never tell you anything.

833
01:02:57,358 --> 01:02:59,483
You're the sophisticated ones...

834
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:02,695
with all your music and your gear.

835
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,864
But, you know, it's superficial.

836
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:07,449
It's a sheen.

837
01:03:07,534 --> 01:03:10,452
There's nothing solid
or worthwhile underneath.

838
01:03:10,536 --> 01:03:13,206
Why do I know this?

839
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:15,875
Why do I know there's been no advance...

840
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:19,878
in discipline or decency
or morals or manners?

841
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:21,463
Why do I know it?

842
01:03:21,547 --> 01:03:25,717
Because I still have to use this
to you boys every day.

843
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:30,556
Why? In the '20s and '30s,
I could understand it.

844
01:03:30,641 --> 01:03:32,557
They were hard times.

845
01:03:32,643 --> 01:03:36,061
But they produced qualities in people
that you lot will never have.

846
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:39,190
I can be stopped in the street
by someone I taught then...

847
01:03:39,273 --> 01:03:41,150
and we'll talk about the old days...

848
01:03:41,235 --> 01:03:43,987
and we'll laugh
about the thrashings that I gave him.

849
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,072
But what do I get from you lot?

850
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:49,074
A honk...

851
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:51,661
from a greasy, pimply-faced youth...

852
01:03:51,744 --> 01:03:55,039
sitting at the wheel
of a big secondhand car.

853
01:03:55,791 --> 01:03:59,626
I don't know. I just don't know.

854
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:02,922
No guts. No backbone.

855
01:04:03,007 --> 01:04:05,465
Nothing to commend you whatsoever.

856
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:08,260
Mere fodder for the mass media.

857
01:04:12,474 --> 01:04:16,686
And so, until someone
produces a better solution...

858
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:19,355
I'll continue to use this cane...

859
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:24,277
knowing fully well that you'll be back
for it time and time and time again.

860
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:29,949
You smokers will go out of here
with your hands ringing.

861
01:04:30,034 --> 01:04:32,201
But will it stop you smoking?

862
01:04:32,286 --> 01:04:34,369
You're already looking forward
to smoking at break.

863
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:36,766
- You, lad! What are you grinning about?
- I'm not grinning, sir.

864
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:40,126
You are! I'll bet you're already thinking
about smoking at break.

865
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:42,128
Empty your pockets.

866
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:45,672
They're loaded with cigarettes.
Come on, all of you! Empty your pockets.

867
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:51,971
- Please, sir -
- Quiet, lad! Empty your pockets!

868
01:04:52,056 --> 01:04:54,514
- Sir, you don't understand -
- Empty your pockets, lad.

869
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:56,934
Disgusting!

870
01:04:59,646 --> 01:05:01,146
Please, sir -

871
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:04,150
You again? You again?

872
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:07,235
- Yes, sir.
- Empty your pockets.

873
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,362
But, sir, I've brought a message
from Mrs. Spooner.

874
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:11,114
Empty your pockets!

875
01:05:13,911 --> 01:05:16,496
I don't believe it.

876
01:05:17,748 --> 01:05:19,831
I don't believe this.

877
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:24,420
Empty your pockets, lad.

878
01:05:24,505 --> 01:05:26,338
Empty your pockets when you're told!

879
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:27,923
Come on, lad!

880
01:05:28,592 --> 01:05:30,635
Ah!

881
01:05:32,346 --> 01:05:35,764
A regular little cigarette factory,
aren't you?

882
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:37,349
Yes, sir.

883
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:43,856
Put that rubbish away!

884
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:09,590
[ Gryce ] Now, I hope it's going to be
a lesson to you.

885
01:06:10,342 --> 01:06:13,219
I don't suppose for one minute it will be.

886
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:17,722
I don't doubt before the end of the week
you'll be back in here again...

887
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:21,561
for exactly the same crime -
smoking.

888
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:25,565
Perhaps once in a while,
it might sink in.

889
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:26,815
Yes, sir.

890
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:28,860
That you're wasting your money.

891
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:30,987
That it's your money
that you're burning...

892
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:34,322
and it's your hands that get caned
when you come in here.

893
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:41,789
Good morning. Entry of the gladiators.
Where have you been?

894
01:06:41,873 --> 01:06:43,916
- Been to see Mr. Gryce, sir.
- Give you the stick?

895
01:06:44,001 --> 01:06:45,001
- Hmm.
- Sir.

896
01:06:45,085 --> 01:06:46,878
- How many did you get?
- Two.

897
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:49,088
- Did it hurt?
- [ Both ] Not bad.

898
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:52,925
Oh. Hope it didn't.
Go and sit down.

899
01:06:55,929 --> 01:06:58,014
Right. Now, fact.

900
01:06:58,097 --> 01:07:01,516
Anne, tell me what a fact is.

901
01:07:01,601 --> 01:07:03,686
Don't give me a fact.

902
01:07:03,769 --> 01:07:07,356
You know, don't say that Guthrie's got
a tatty head or anything like that.

903
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:12,903
[ Anne ] A fact is something
what you find evidence of, like the truth.

904
01:07:13,487 --> 01:07:16,282
Something that you know
has actually happened.

905
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:19,827
This is a fact.
All right? Have you got that clear?

906
01:07:19,911 --> 01:07:22,454
- [ Students ] Yes, sir.
- Good.

907
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:25,791
Tibbutt, sit up straight.

908
01:07:25,876 --> 01:07:28,960
And I want the rest of you
to look at him, if you can bear it...

909
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:31,672
and tell me some facts about Tibbutt.

910
01:07:31,757 --> 01:07:32,797
Wolstenholme?

911
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:34,800
He's always tryin' to go with lasses
at night.

912
01:07:34,885 --> 01:07:37,844
Is he? Guthrie?

913
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:39,972
He smokes.

914
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:41,724
- Do I heck!
- Thou does.

915
01:07:41,807 --> 01:07:43,869
- Get knotted, Guthrie!
- [ Farthing ] All right, all right.

916
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:47,146
I'm not interested in what he does
out of school hours...

917
01:07:47,231 --> 01:07:50,483
as long as he doesn't come into the class
smoking a fag.

918
01:07:50,567 --> 01:07:52,235
All right?

919
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:56,155
Come on, you people who aren't thinking.

920
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:58,532
Right, Julie.

921
01:07:58,617 --> 01:08:03,663
I want you to think of an incident that's
happened to you sometime in the past...

922
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:08,041
that is true and that you think
will interest the rest of the class.

923
01:08:08,126 --> 01:08:10,418
- All right?
- Well, uh...

924
01:08:11,588 --> 01:08:14,090
I went to this all-night party yesterday.

925
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:16,926
And, uh -

926
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:21,805
About 3:00, we went -
we were dancin' in the garden.

927
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:25,184
Me and her and ail the rest.

928
01:08:25,269 --> 01:08:27,853
Can't mention names.
And, uh...

929
01:08:27,938 --> 01:08:30,021
this woman comes
across from t' road...

930
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:34,859
and, uh, she tells us
to-to make less noise...

931
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:36,695
or else she'd fetch police.

932
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:41,199
So, well - So we said,
let her fetch 'em if she wanted.

933
01:08:41,284 --> 01:08:46,122
So, she fetched 'em.

934
01:08:46,206 --> 01:08:49,375
Things that have actually happened.
How about another one?

935
01:08:50,377 --> 01:08:52,002
What about you, Casper?

936
01:08:52,878 --> 01:08:54,337
Casper!

937
01:08:54,422 --> 01:08:55,881
What, sir?

938
01:08:55,966 --> 01:08:58,426
"What, sir?"
You'd know if you'd been listening.

939
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:02,430
What have we just been talking about?

940
01:09:04,056 --> 01:09:05,557
Stories, sir.

941
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:08,560
What kind of stories?

942
01:09:10,021 --> 01:09:12,439
You haven't been listening
to a word I've said, have you?

943
01:09:12,524 --> 01:09:14,984
- Yes, sir. Some of it.
- "Some of it"?

944
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:17,819
Stand up!

945
01:09:22,908 --> 01:09:25,243
Right. Now you're gonna tell us
a story about yourself.

946
01:09:25,328 --> 01:09:27,162
- I don't know any, sir.
- You don't know any?

947
01:09:27,247 --> 01:09:29,081
Well, you stand there till you do.

948
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:35,003
Always somebody, isn't there, eh?

949
01:09:35,087 --> 01:09:36,921
Somebody who wants to be awkward.

950
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:39,675
Just won't be interested.
It doesn't matter what you do.

951
01:09:41,845 --> 01:09:43,929
Just like you, Casper.

952
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:48,893
Come on.

953
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:53,271
I'll give you two minutes -
two minutes to think of something...

954
01:09:53,356 --> 01:09:55,690
or the whole class comes back at 4:00.

955
01:09:56,568 --> 01:09:58,444
Come on, Casper.
Don't stand there like a nail.

956
01:09:58,528 --> 01:09:59,737
[ Guthrie ]
He is a nail.

957
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:03,365
Come on. I say... tell 'em.

958
01:10:04,326 --> 01:10:05,886
[ Boy ]
Tell him about the hawk, Casper.

959
01:10:05,911 --> 01:10:09,037
If anybody else calls out,
it'll be the last call they make.

960
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:10,956
Speed?

961
01:10:11,041 --> 01:10:13,458
He's got this hawk, sir,
and he goes mad over it.

962
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:16,878
He never knocks about with anybody else.
He just goes with t' hawk all the time.

963
01:10:16,962 --> 01:10:19,082
- He's crackers over it.
- Better than thee, any road.

964
01:10:19,131 --> 01:10:20,800
[ Farthing ]
All right, Casper.

965
01:10:22,219 --> 01:10:23,719
Sit down.

966
01:10:26,305 --> 01:10:28,932
Now, come on, come on.
Tell us about this hawk.

967
01:10:29,016 --> 01:10:30,518
Where'd you get it from?

968
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:32,936
- I found it, sir.
- Where?

969
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:34,563
In the woods.

970
01:10:34,648 --> 01:10:36,106
And where do you keep it?

971
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:37,690
In the shed.

972
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:39,819
What do you feed it on?

973
01:10:39,903 --> 01:10:42,904
Beef. Mice. Birds.

974
01:10:42,988 --> 01:10:46,826
But isn't it cruel to keep it in the shed?
I mean, wouldn't it be happier flying free?

975
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:50,162
I don't keep it in the shed all the
time, sir. I fly it every day.

976
01:10:50,247 --> 01:10:52,581
Doesn't it fly away?
I thought they were wild birds.

977
01:10:52,666 --> 01:10:54,833
Of course it don't fly away, sir.
I've trained it.

978
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:57,979
[ Farthing ] Aren't you gonna tell us
about it? How have you trained your hawk?

979
01:10:58,003 --> 01:11:00,881
[ Billy ] You have to be right careful
with them, sir. Right patient.

980
01:11:00,966 --> 01:11:03,007
You've got to feed them
when they're hungry, see?

981
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:06,595
And you can only do owt
when they're at feeding time like, sir.

982
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:07,680
Yeah?

983
01:11:07,764 --> 01:11:09,849
They've got these Jesses on, sir,
all the time.

984
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:11,434
These what?

985
01:11:11,518 --> 01:11:12,976
Jesses, sir.

986
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:15,270
- How do you spell that?
- J-E -

987
01:11:15,354 --> 01:11:17,355
All right, come out here. Come on.

988
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:19,358
You'd better show us
on the board, hmm?

989
01:11:19,443 --> 01:11:22,194
"Jesses"?
This is a new word to me.

990
01:11:22,279 --> 01:11:24,654
Hands up, those who've heard
of Jesses before.

991
01:11:24,738 --> 01:11:26,614
Nobody. Go on. Write it up there.

992
01:11:32,663 --> 01:11:34,957
Right. Now tell us what it is.

993
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:38,502
Well, they're like leather straps, sir,
and they're attached to birds' feet.

994
01:11:38,587 --> 01:11:40,753
And say I've got the bird on me hand.

995
01:11:40,838 --> 01:11:43,340
The straps go down there,
then there's swivel.

996
01:11:43,425 --> 01:11:45,259
"Swivel."
Write that on the board.

997
01:11:50,181 --> 01:11:52,099
[ Billy ]
Then you've got your leash.

998
01:11:52,184 --> 01:11:53,850
[ Farthing ]
"Leash." On the board.

999
01:11:56,479 --> 01:11:58,564
[ Billy ]
l fed it on me hand first.

1000
01:11:58,648 --> 01:12:01,859
Then when it got to know me,
I fed it on me glove.

1001
01:12:02,527 --> 01:12:06,238
And after a while,
l put it two inches away from its claws.

1002
01:12:07,073 --> 01:12:09,033
And, uh - Like that, right?

1003
01:12:09,909 --> 01:12:12,411
It started to jump for the meat.

1004
01:12:12,496 --> 01:12:14,787
When it started to jump,
l could move me hand away.

1005
01:12:14,872 --> 01:12:16,789
[ Farthing ]
Hold your hand up so we can see.

1006
01:12:16,875 --> 01:12:20,418
I could move me hand away,
like to four inches and six inches.

1007
01:12:20,503 --> 01:12:23,380
And when it were doin' that,
l started doing it with t' leash.

1008
01:12:23,465 --> 01:12:25,090
Do they need water, like?

1009
01:12:25,175 --> 01:12:28,176
You know, when you've got a budgie,
and you put water in the budgie's cage.

1010
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:30,345
Do they need water like that?

1011
01:12:30,430 --> 01:12:32,430
[ Billy ]
Well, it, like, has a bath.

1012
01:12:32,515 --> 01:12:35,059
It has a bath right early on
in the morning, like.

1013
01:12:35,976 --> 01:12:39,438
When do you feed it?
How many times a day?

1014
01:12:39,523 --> 01:12:42,122
To start off with, three or four times,
you know, to get it plump.

1015
01:12:42,149 --> 01:12:43,869
You make it all sound very exciting, Billy.

1016
01:12:43,944 --> 01:12:47,445
It is, sir. But most exciting thing -
when I flew her free first time, sir.

1017
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:49,782
- Do you want to hear about that?
- Yes, sir.

1018
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:51,783
Aye. Come on.

1019
01:12:51,868 --> 01:12:56,287
Well, I'd been using creance
for about a week...

1020
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:58,957
and it had been going 30, 40 yards.

1021
01:12:59,042 --> 01:13:02,962
And it says when birds are going
30, 40 yards, it says in t' book...

1022
01:13:03,046 --> 01:13:05,547
it's time that it can start to fly free.

1023
01:13:07,551 --> 01:13:12,930
Well, I'd been - you know, I'd been
wanting to fly it free, but I daren't.

1024
01:13:13,014 --> 01:13:15,640
You know, I were frightened
it'd fly off or something like that.

1025
01:13:15,725 --> 01:13:18,310
This had been going on
for four or five days.

1026
01:13:18,395 --> 01:13:22,273
And I keep on to meself, sayin' that...
fly it free next day.

1027
01:13:22,356 --> 01:13:24,399
Anyway, I got right mad with meself...

1028
01:13:24,484 --> 01:13:26,652
and says, "Right, I'm
flying it free tomorrow."

1029
01:13:27,487 --> 01:13:29,822
Anyway, that night -
that Friday night, it were -

1030
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:33,951
l didn't feed her up,
so that she'd be sharp set next morning.

1031
01:13:34,034 --> 01:13:36,036
And I went to bed that night -
Friday night -

1032
01:13:36,121 --> 01:13:38,747
and I didn't get an hour's sleep at all.

1033
01:13:38,832 --> 01:13:43,293
I were frightened about the bird,
that she'd fly off or summat like that.

1034
01:13:43,377 --> 01:13:46,296
Anyway, when the morning came,
I kept on saying to meself...

1035
01:13:46,381 --> 01:13:49,300
"Well, if she flies off, she flies off,
and it can't be helped."

1036
01:13:49,384 --> 01:13:53,304
So, I took swivel off
and let her hop onto t' post.

1037
01:13:53,387 --> 01:13:55,514
There were nowt stopping her now.
She could fly off.

1038
01:13:55,599 --> 01:13:57,850
All were on her were her Jesses.

1039
01:13:57,934 --> 01:14:00,853
I thought, she must fly off.
She's forced to fly off.

1040
01:14:00,936 --> 01:14:04,523
But she didn't. She just stood there.
I were terrified.

1041
01:14:04,608 --> 01:14:07,693
Well, anyway, she was stood there,
and I walked off into t' field...

1042
01:14:07,777 --> 01:14:09,862
and she were looking round
all over the place.

1043
01:14:09,945 --> 01:14:14,033
And when I got in about 70 yards
from where - in the middle of t' field...

1044
01:14:14,117 --> 01:14:15,701
l called her.

1045
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:20,372
"Kes! Kes! Come, Kes!
Come on then!"

1046
01:14:20,457 --> 01:14:23,958
Nowt happened, so I thought, well,
I'd better walk back and pick her up.

1047
01:14:24,043 --> 01:14:26,545
So, while I were walking back,
l saw her flying.

1048
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:28,881
She came like a bomb.

1049
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:33,426
About a yard off the floor, like lightning,
head still, and you couldn't hear t' wings.

1050
01:14:33,511 --> 01:14:36,889
There weren't a sound from the wings -
and straight onto the glove - Wham!

1051
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:38,974
And she grabbed me for t' meat.

1052
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:43,395
Anyway, I were pleased with meself,
and I didn't know what to do.

1053
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:47,358
So I thought, "Well, I better do it again
just to prove it weren't luck."

1054
01:14:47,442 --> 01:14:49,734
So, I took her back onto t' post...

1055
01:14:51,404 --> 01:14:54,573
and walked back up into t' middle
of t' field and called her again.

1056
01:14:54,658 --> 01:14:56,742
And she came just as good
as first time...

1057
01:14:56,826 --> 01:14:59,411
straight onto t' glove
and grabbed me for t' meat.

1058
01:14:59,496 --> 01:15:03,748
Well, that were it, sir. I'd trained
her, sir, and that were ail I could do.

1059
01:15:03,832 --> 01:15:06,085
[ Farthing ]
l think you've done enough, don't you?

1060
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:09,546
Well done, Billy. Big hand of applause.

1061
01:15:21,434 --> 01:15:23,769
- [ MacDowell ] Have you got owt, Casper?
- Nay.

1062
01:15:23,853 --> 01:15:26,604
Thou never has, has thou?
Thou just cadges, all the time.

1063
01:15:26,689 --> 01:15:28,833
Casper the Cadger.
That's what they ought to call thee.

1064
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:30,418
I wouldn't give thee owt if I had,
MacDowell.

1065
01:15:30,443 --> 01:15:33,444
I'll give thee summat in a minute.
What's thou going for?

1066
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:35,948
Don't tha like company?
They say thee mother does.

1067
01:15:36,032 --> 01:15:38,701
Tha's got more uncles in this city
than any other kid.

1068
01:15:38,784 --> 01:15:40,786
- Shut thee mouth!
- Come here and make me.

1069
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:42,847
Tha wouldn't say that to our Jud.
He'd murder thee.

1070
01:15:42,872 --> 01:15:44,372
Your Jud's nowt.

1071
01:15:44,457 --> 01:15:46,582
What? He's cock of t' estate,
that's ail.

1072
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:49,211
- I bet I know somebody who could do him.
- Who? Thee father?

1073
01:15:50,713 --> 01:15:52,296
He ain't even thee brother.

1074
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:53,881
What is he then, me sister?

1075
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:56,135
They don't even call him Casper,
for a start.

1076
01:15:56,219 --> 01:15:58,720
Of course he's me brother!
We live in t' same house, don't we?

1077
01:16:01,306 --> 01:16:04,309
- [ Boy ] Go on, get him!
- [ Cheering, Shouting ]

1078
01:16:41,765 --> 01:16:43,347
Up, up, up!

1079
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:47,101
Right, you lot!
Ten seconds! Out of my sight!

1080
01:16:47,186 --> 01:16:49,563

1081
01:16:52,775 --> 01:16:54,734
[ Farthing ]
Off with you! Hop it!

1082
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:58,780
Right, come here, you two.
Come on.

1083
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:03,202
- What's goin' on?
- It was him, sir. He started it.

1084
01:17:03,286 --> 01:17:06,246
- He's been chucking coke.
- Ah, shut up! Shut up!

1085
01:17:07,122 --> 01:17:10,292
It's always the same tale, isn't it?
Somebody else's fault, nobody's to blame.

1086
01:17:11,461 --> 01:17:13,921
Look at the mess you're in!
Look at the state you've made!

1087
01:17:14,588 --> 01:17:16,942
Don't look so sorry for yourself, Casper.
You're not dead yet.

1088
01:17:16,966 --> 01:17:19,384
- He will be when I've had him.
- Oh, yes!

1089
01:17:19,469 --> 01:17:22,470
You're a big lad, aren't you? He's just
about your size, Casper, isn't he?

1090
01:17:22,555 --> 01:17:24,139
Eh?

1091
01:17:24,224 --> 01:17:26,225
Why don't you pick on somebody
your own size?

1092
01:17:26,309 --> 01:17:29,228
What if I rubbed your nose in the coke?
What would you say about that?

1093
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:31,729
You'd say I was a bully, wouldn't you?
And you'd be right.

1094
01:17:31,814 --> 01:17:34,315
'Cause I'm bigger and I'm stronger
than you, aren't l?

1095
01:17:34,399 --> 01:17:35,984
- Eh?
- I'll fetch me dad.

1096
01:17:36,069 --> 01:17:38,109
Oh, yes, you'll fetch your dad.
And I'll fetch mine.

1097
01:17:38,154 --> 01:17:40,404
My dad's heavyweight champion
of the world, my dad is.

1098
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:42,740
So what would your dad do then, eh?

1099
01:17:45,578 --> 01:17:47,496
That's what it's like to be bullied.

1100
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:50,082
You don't like it, do you?

1101
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:52,583
You'll like it a bit less
if I ever catch you at it again.

1102
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:54,646
Do you understand, MacDowell?
Do you understand it?

1103
01:17:54,671 --> 01:17:56,171
Yes, sir.

1104
01:17:57,340 --> 01:17:59,925
Get it shoveled up.
And wait a minute.

1105
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:01,510
- Have you been smoking?
- No, sir.

1106
01:18:01,594 --> 01:18:03,655
You have, haven't you?
I can smell it on your breath!

1107
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:04,680
No, sir.

1108
01:18:04,764 --> 01:18:06,597
See me afterwards.
Get it done. Go on.

1109
01:18:20,363 --> 01:18:21,863
Now, what's it all about?

1110
01:18:21,948 --> 01:18:24,760
He keeps calling me names, sir, and
saying things about me dad and me mum...

1111
01:18:24,783 --> 01:18:26,384
and our Jud,
and everybody were laughing.

1112
01:18:26,452 --> 01:18:28,912
All right, all right, all right.
Calm down.

1113
01:18:28,997 --> 01:18:31,622
They always seem to pick on you,
don't they, Casper? Why is it?

1114
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:34,126
- Don't know, sir.
- Is it because you're a bad 'un?

1115
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:36,795
Maybe I am sometimes,
but I'm not that bad, sir.

1116
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:40,923
I know stacks of other kids that's worse
than me, but they seem to get away with it.

1117
01:18:41,009 --> 01:18:42,509
[ Farthing ]
Hmm.

1118
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:46,889
Why else do you think? Eh?
There must be some reason, mustn't there?

1119
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:48,931
Well, take this morning, sir.

1120
01:18:49,016 --> 01:18:51,560
I just came in, sir, and just dozed off.

1121
01:18:51,644 --> 01:18:53,804
I wasn't doin' nowt wrong, sir.
I'd been up since 6:00.

1122
01:18:53,854 --> 01:18:56,323
I had to do t' papers,
then I had to rush home

1123
01:18:56,336 --> 01:18:58,817
to have a look at t' bird,
then run to school.

1124
01:18:58,902 --> 01:19:00,671
I mean to say, you'd be tired,
wouldn't you, sir?

1125
01:19:00,694 --> 01:19:02,654
- I'd be exhausted.
- And that's not -

1126
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:04,739
You shouldn't be caned for that,
should you, sir?

1127
01:19:04,823 --> 01:19:06,658
And you can't tell Mr. Gryce that.

1128
01:19:06,743 --> 01:19:08,606
And this little lad, sir
- He'd only brought

1129
01:19:08,618 --> 01:19:10,162
a letter from one
of the teachers...

1130
01:19:10,246 --> 01:19:11,747
and he got caned.

1131
01:19:12,582 --> 01:19:15,500
It's nowt to laugh at, sir.
Afterwards, he was sick as a dog.

1132
01:19:15,585 --> 01:19:17,168
[ Farthing ]
Was he?

1133
01:19:17,252 --> 01:19:20,338
And teachers, sir.
They're not bothered about us, sir.

1134
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:23,759
If we're 4C, they think we're numbskulls
owt like that, sir.

1135
01:19:23,842 --> 01:19:26,113
And when they have time,

01:30:55,451 --> 01:30:57,534
We write 15 one, five.

1301
01:30:57,619 --> 01:30:59,537
You write five, one.

1302
01:31:07,337 --> 01:31:11,298
Isn't that that, uh, illustrious brother
of yours, Casper?

1303
01:31:11,382 --> 01:31:12,382
[ Billy ]
Sir.

1304
01:31:12,426 --> 01:31:15,927
Shouldn't have thought he was the type to
have paid a visit to his old school again.

1305
01:31:18,306 --> 01:31:20,891
What's the matter? Don't you feel well?

1306
01:31:20,975 --> 01:31:22,060
No, sir.

1307
01:31:22,144 --> 01:31:24,561
You want to go out and get
a drink of water or something?

1308
01:31:24,646 --> 01:31:26,314
No, sir.

1309
01:31:26,398 --> 01:31:28,542
Well, open the window.
Perhaps it'll make you feel better.

1310
01:31:28,567 --> 01:31:30,525
I'm all right, sir.

1311
01:31:30,610 --> 01:31:32,569
Please yourself.

1312
01:31:35,407 --> 01:31:38,242
Right. Now just pass your books forward,
will you, to the front.

1313
01:31:39,662 --> 01:31:42,704
Front person on each row,
bring them to my desk, will you?

1314
01:32:02,184 --> 01:32:04,601
What's the matter, Casper?
Lost something?

1315
01:32:04,686 --> 01:32:07,104
- Me, sir? No, sir.
- On your way then.

1316
01:32:36,635 --> 01:32:38,219
[ MacDowell ]
What's up with thee, Jud?

1317
01:32:38,302 --> 01:32:41,305
[ Jud ] What's up with me
is that little bastard, our Billy.

1318
01:32:41,390 --> 01:32:44,391
I left him with a bet for the horses,
and he's kept the stinkin' money.

1319
01:32:44,475 --> 01:32:46,394
I'll kill the little git
when I get hold of him.

1320
01:32:46,478 --> 01:32:49,104
- [ MacDowell ] Is that right?
- [ Jud ] I'll murder him.

1321
01:32:54,153 --> 01:32:55,792
What do you think you're playing at, lad?

1322
01:32:55,863 --> 01:32:57,743
No, sir. I'm just going
to the toilet, sir.

1323
01:32:57,755 --> 01:32:58,864
Hurry up then. Be quick!

1324
01:33:20,345 --> 01:33:21,929
[ Clegg ]
Hey! I'm on here!

1325
01:33:22,014 --> 01:33:24,181
- Seen our Billy?
- Aye. He's on here with me.

1326
01:33:24,265 --> 01:33:26,292
Trying to be funny?
'Cause I'll stick thee

1327
01:33:26,304 --> 01:33:28,435
head down there, old
pal, and I'll flush it.

1328
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:30,188
I asked if tha'd seen him.

1329
01:33:30,271 --> 01:33:31,814
I wouldn't tell thee if I had.

1330
01:33:31,899 --> 01:33:34,692
- Look, I'm warnin' you!
- Oww!

1331
01:35:31,894 --> 01:35:34,478
Hey, Tibbutt, have you seen our Jud?

1332
01:35:34,563 --> 01:35:37,042
What's thou been doing?
They've been looking all over for thee.

1333
01:35:37,106 --> 01:35:38,440
- Who has?
- Gryce Pudding!

1334
01:35:38,524 --> 01:35:40,484
- What for? I ain't done nowt.
- Youth employment.

1335
01:35:40,569 --> 01:35:42,569
Tha should have gone
for the interview last lesson.

1336
01:35:42,654 --> 01:35:44,447
- Has tha seen our Jud?
- Yeah.

1337
01:35:44,530 --> 01:35:46,823
He wanted to know where thou was,
that's ail.

1338
01:35:46,908 --> 01:35:49,493
What did tha run away for
when thee saw him?

1339
01:35:49,578 --> 01:35:51,328
Casper! Where the devil have you been?

1340
01:35:51,412 --> 01:35:52,412
Nowhere, sir.

1341
01:35:52,497 --> 01:35:54,623
Nowhere? Who are you,
the invisible Man?

1342
01:35:54,707 --> 01:35:56,917
I felt sick, sir, so I went to the toilets.

1343
01:35:57,002 --> 01:35:58,920
What happened?
Did you drop down it?

1344
01:35:59,003 --> 01:36:01,064
I've had prefects looking
ail over the school for you.

1345
01:36:01,088 --> 01:36:03,341
Well, I went out then, sir,
for a breath of fresh air.

1346
01:36:03,425 --> 01:36:05,444
- And where are you going now?
- Employment office, sir.

1347
01:36:05,469 --> 01:36:08,429
For your interview?
Well, get off then, lad!

1348
01:36:08,512 --> 01:36:10,680
And God help your future employer!

1349
01:36:44,882 --> 01:36:46,550
Come and sit over there.

1350
01:37:01,649 --> 01:37:03,149
Sit up, Peter.

1351
01:37:03,234 --> 01:37:05,653
I'm sat up.

1352
01:37:05,737 --> 01:37:08,447
Don't be like a dummy
when you get in there.

1353
01:37:08,532 --> 01:37:12,409
Just tell him you're after a good job
in an office, or something like that.

1354
01:37:12,493 --> 01:37:14,286
I'm not working in an office.

1355
01:37:15,079 --> 01:37:17,414
What are you after then,
a job on the bins?

1356
01:37:17,498 --> 01:37:19,082
Ma, can't you shut up?

1357
01:37:20,252 --> 01:37:22,086
- Sit up.
- I'm sat up.

1358
01:37:22,170 --> 01:37:24,087
And straighten your tie.

1359
01:37:24,171 --> 01:37:26,256
Tha's nagging.

1360
01:37:26,341 --> 01:37:28,091
Somebody's got to nag.

1361
01:37:35,182 --> 01:37:37,768
<i>- Is it your mum?
- Aye.</i>

1362
01:37:37,853 --> 01:37:39,353
What job are thou after?

1363
01:37:39,438 --> 01:37:40,895
Owt will do me.

1364
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:42,939
- It certainly won't.
- It will.

1365
01:37:43,024 --> 01:37:44,942
- It won't.
- Right. Thank you.

1366
01:37:45,027 --> 01:37:47,235
[ Man ]
Will you send the next one in?

1367
01:37:47,319 --> 01:37:48,319
[ Boy ]
Pardon?

1368
01:37:48,404 --> 01:37:49,881
[ Man ] Will you send
the next one in now, please?

1369
01:37:49,905 --> 01:37:51,407
Right. Okay.

1370
01:37:54,243 --> 01:37:56,037
Isn't it your turn to go in?

1371
01:37:56,121 --> 01:37:57,787
I suppose so.

1372
01:37:57,872 --> 01:37:59,873
Well, go on then.

1373
01:38:16,475 --> 01:38:19,310
[ Man ]
Get out, lad! Knock and wait!

1374
01:38:24,483 --> 01:38:25,649
[ Man ]
Come in.

1375
01:38:28,819 --> 01:38:30,988
Well, come in, lad, if you're coming.

1376
01:38:34,076 --> 01:38:35,576
Sit down, Walker.

1377
01:38:35,659 --> 01:38:37,118
I'm not Walker, sir.

1378
01:38:37,203 --> 01:38:40,663
Well, who are you, then? According to my
list, it should be Gerald Walker next.

1379
01:38:40,748 --> 01:38:43,000
Oliver, Stenton, then Walker.

1380
01:38:43,085 --> 01:38:45,336
- I'm Casper.
- Casper?

1381
01:38:45,420 --> 01:38:49,090
Oh, sit down, Casper. I should have
seen you earlier, shouldn't I?

1382
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:55,512
Well then, Casper, what kind
of job had you got in mind?

1383
01:38:59,266 --> 01:39:00,893
Well?

1384
01:39:00,976 --> 01:39:03,604
I don't know, sir.
I haven't thought about it, like.

1385
01:39:03,688 --> 01:39:05,523
Well, you should be thinking about it.

1386
01:39:05,606 --> 01:39:08,192
You want to start off
on the right foot, don't you?

1387
01:39:12,530 --> 01:39:15,365
Right then.
Well, would you like to work in an office?

1388
01:39:15,449 --> 01:39:17,618
Or would you prefer manual work?

1389
01:39:17,702 --> 01:39:19,286
What's manual work?

1390
01:39:19,371 --> 01:39:21,710
Oh, it means working
with your hands, things

1391
01:39:21,721 --> 01:39:23,707
like farming,
engineering, plumbing -

1392
01:39:23,792 --> 01:39:27,211
things like that,
as opposed to pen-pushing jobs.

1393
01:39:27,295 --> 01:39:29,255
You write in an office.

1394
01:39:29,338 --> 01:39:31,090
Have a job to read and write.

1395
01:39:31,173 --> 01:39:32,466
Oh.

1396
01:39:34,219 --> 01:39:36,052
Manual.

1397
01:39:37,639 --> 01:39:43,060
Tell me, Casper, have you ever thought
about entering a trade as an apprentice?

1398
01:39:43,145 --> 01:39:46,729
You know, as an electrician or a bricklayer
or something like that.

1399
01:39:47,399 --> 01:39:51,193
Of course, the money's not too good
while you're serving your apprenticeship.

1400
01:39:51,278 --> 01:39:54,988
And if you do stick it out, you'll always
have a trade at your fingertips, won't you?

1401
01:39:55,073 --> 01:39:56,489
Mm-hmm.

1402
01:39:56,574 --> 01:39:58,742
Well then, Casper,
what do you think about it?

1403
01:39:58,827 --> 01:40:01,744
And as you've already said,
you feel better working with your hands.

1404
01:40:01,829 --> 01:40:03,622
Perhaps this is your best bet.

1405
01:40:03,707 --> 01:40:05,832
Of course, you'd have to go
to technical college...

1406
01:40:05,917 --> 01:40:08,836
and study for various examinations.

1407
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:10,587
But some lads do it.

1408
01:40:10,671 --> 01:40:12,756
Some do it for years,
two or three nights a week...

1409
01:40:12,841 --> 01:40:15,592
right from leaving school
right up to the mid-20s...

1410
01:40:15,676 --> 01:40:18,887
when they take their Higher National,
or even degrees.

1411
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:22,474
I say, lad, are you listening to me?

1412
01:40:22,559 --> 01:40:23,934
Yeah.

1413
01:40:24,019 --> 01:40:25,603
You don't look as though you are.

1414
01:40:25,686 --> 01:40:28,229
I've other lads to see before 4:00,
you know.

1415
01:40:30,108 --> 01:40:32,775
Well, if nothing I've mentioned so far
appeals to you...

1416
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:36,279
and if you can stand a hard day's work
and you don't mind getting dirty...

1417
01:40:36,363 --> 01:40:37,675
there are good opportunities
in mining.

1418
01:40:37,698 --> 01:40:39,949
I'm not going down pit.

1419
01:40:40,034 --> 01:40:43,787
Don't be put off by what you've heard.
Conditions have improved tremendously.

1420
01:40:44,538 --> 01:40:46,457
I won't be seen dead down pit.

1421
01:40:47,125 --> 01:40:50,085
What about hobbies?
What hobbies have you got?

1422
01:40:50,170 --> 01:40:54,465
Do you like gardening or constructing
Meccano sets or anything like that?

1423
01:40:56,217 --> 01:40:57,717
Don't you have any hobbies at all?

1424
01:40:57,801 --> 01:40:59,386
Can I go now?

1425
01:40:59,470 --> 01:41:01,721
What's wrong with you, lad?
Sit down. Sit down.

1426
01:41:01,805 --> 01:41:03,849
I haven't finished yet.

1427
01:41:05,226 --> 01:41:08,645
Well, I've met some lads in my time,
but I've never met one like you, Casper.

1428
01:41:08,729 --> 01:41:10,730
Half the time you're like
a cat on hot bricks...

1429
01:41:10,814 --> 01:41:12,815
the other half you're not listening.

1430
01:41:13,568 --> 01:41:15,610
Here. Take this form.

1431
01:41:15,694 --> 01:41:19,155
It gives you all the relevant information
about leaving school and starting work -

1432
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:23,118
things like pensions, superannuation,
national insurance, wages and so on.

1433
01:41:23,203 --> 01:41:25,328
At the back,
there's a detachable form.

1434
01:41:25,412 --> 01:41:27,497
When you want your cards,
fill it in -

1435
01:41:27,582 --> 01:41:29,332
Come back here, lad.
I haven't finished yet.

1436
01:41:29,417 --> 01:41:32,252
When you want your cards, fill in
that form, send it in to the office.

1437
01:41:32,337 --> 01:41:33,503
- Have you got that?
- Yeah.

1438
01:41:33,587 --> 01:41:35,506
Don't forget. And listen, Casper -

1439
01:41:35,590 --> 01:41:38,841
If you do have any trouble getting fixed
up, do come in and see me, won't you?

1440
01:41:38,926 --> 01:41:41,095
- Yes, sir.
- Send the next boy in.

1441
01:42:00,614 --> 01:42:01,907
Kes!

1442
01:42:06,328 --> 01:42:07,829
Kes!

1443
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,207
Kes!

1444
01:42:17,465 --> 01:42:18,631
Kes!

1445
01:42:21,720 --> 01:42:23,220
Kes!

1446
01:42:33,981 --> 01:42:35,733
Jud?

1447
01:42:37,652 --> 01:42:40,320
Jud! Mother!

1448
01:42:43,742 --> 01:42:46,743
- I say, have you seen our Jud?
- I haven't, love. I'm sorry.

1449
01:42:53,335 --> 01:42:55,836
- Have you seen our Jud?
- Of course I've seen your Jud.

1450
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:58,733
Doesn't look as though you've seen him,
else you wouldn't be all in one piece.

1451
01:42:58,756 --> 01:43:00,609
- You've seen him then?
- Of course I've seen him.

1452
01:43:00,632 --> 01:43:03,712
He come in here playin' hell up. Goin'
to pull t' counter down and everything.

1453
01:43:03,761 --> 01:43:05,095
What did you do then?

1454
01:43:05,180 --> 01:43:07,930
I had to fetch Eric Cluff
to prove tha hadn't put bet on.

1455
01:43:08,015 --> 01:43:10,934
- They won, then, did they?
- Both of 'em - 100-to-6 and 4-to-1.

1456
01:43:11,019 --> 01:43:13,936
- He'd have won a tenner, I tell thee that.
- Bloody hell.

1457
01:43:15,023 --> 01:43:16,523
Kes!

1458
01:43:20,028 --> 01:43:21,694
Come on, Kes!

1459
01:43:22,947 --> 01:43:24,614
Come on, lass!

1460
01:43:37,670 --> 01:43:38,837
Kes!

1461
01:43:42,384 --> 01:43:43,550
Kes!

1462
01:44:04,823 --> 01:44:06,489
Come on, Kes!

1463
01:44:51,118 --> 01:44:52,618
Kes!

1464
01:45:07,969 --> 01:45:09,470
Kes!

1465
01:45:36,914 --> 01:45:38,414
Where is it?
What's thou done with it?

1466
01:45:38,500 --> 01:45:41,417
Where've you been till this time?
Your tea's going cold here.

1467
01:45:41,502 --> 01:45:43,753
I said, where is it?

1468
01:45:45,881 --> 01:45:48,341
- What's thou starin' at?
- Thee, you little pig!

1469
01:45:48,426 --> 01:45:50,927
Don't call me a little pig,
or I'll bet you -

1470
01:45:51,011 --> 01:45:52,720
- Get back!
- Hey! Hey!

1471
01:45:53,597 --> 01:45:56,265
Jud, what's all
t' bloody pushin' and shovin'?

1472
01:45:56,350 --> 01:45:57,850
[ Billy ]
Ask him. He knows.

1473
01:45:57,935 --> 01:46:00,581
Yes, and thou'd have known it if I'd
have got hold of thee this afternoon.

1474
01:46:00,604 --> 01:46:03,524
- Oh, get lost!
- Knows what? What's going on?

1475
01:46:03,608 --> 01:46:05,502
What's up with him?
What have you been doing to him?

1476
01:46:05,527 --> 01:46:07,150
If he'd have put that bet
on the horses like he were

1477
01:46:07,162 --> 01:46:08,922
told to this morning, there
would've been none of this.

1478
01:46:08,947 --> 01:46:11,280
- Well, he's put it on, hasn't he?
- Has he, bloody hell!

1479
01:46:11,365 --> 01:46:14,261
Well, I told him to. I asked you not to
forget before I went to work this morning.

1480
01:46:14,284 --> 01:46:15,743
He didn't forget.
He spent t' money!

1481
01:46:15,828 --> 01:46:17,496
- How do you know?
- Because he has.

1482
01:46:17,579 --> 01:46:20,373
What are you getting so damned upset for?
Have they won or summat?

1483
01:46:20,457 --> 01:46:22,444
Have they won? I'd have
16 quid to draw if

1484
01:46:22,456 --> 01:46:24,545
he'd have kept his
thieving hands to hisself.

1485
01:46:24,628 --> 01:46:25,502
Now look what you've done.

1486
01:46:25,515 --> 01:46:27,190
Tha should have done it
yourself, shouldn't tha?

1487
01:46:27,215 --> 01:46:29,550
Sixteen quid - I could have had
a week off work for that!

1488
01:46:29,634 --> 01:46:31,717
- Get lost, you big pig!
- [ Mother ] Hey!

1489
01:46:31,802 --> 01:46:33,595
Well, what's he upset for?

1490
01:46:33,680 --> 01:46:36,472
Because he's killed me hawk instead,
that's why.

1491
01:46:36,557 --> 01:46:37,890
He never has.

1492
01:46:37,975 --> 01:46:40,560
He has. I know he has.
'Cause he couldn't catch me.

1493
01:46:40,645 --> 01:46:43,939
Jud! You have not killed
this kid's hawk!

1494
01:46:44,023 --> 01:46:45,856
So I have.
What are you gonna do about it?

1495
01:46:45,942 --> 01:46:48,045
[ Mother ] Bloody kill yourself!
That's what you want!

1496
01:46:48,069 --> 01:46:50,945
[ Jud ] It were its own fault.
I was only gonna let it go.

1497
01:46:51,029 --> 01:46:53,948
Kept lashing at me with claws.
I had to kill it. What else could I do?

1498
01:46:54,033 --> 01:46:56,493
You're a big bastard!
A big rotten bastard!

1499
01:46:56,578 --> 01:46:58,119
[ Jud ] Don't call me a bastard!

1500
01:46:58,203 --> 01:46:59,470
[ Mother ] Stop chucking
things like that!

1501
01:46:59,483 --> 01:47:00,306
Thou'll be next to get it!

1502
01:47:00,331 --> 01:47:02,416
You're a big bastard!
A big, bleedin' bastard!

1503
01:47:02,500 --> 01:47:05,167
[ Mother ] That's enough of that language
in here, and you and ail!

1504
01:47:05,252 --> 01:47:07,480
[ Jud ] Sixteen quid. I could have had
a lousy week off work for that.

1505
01:47:07,505 --> 01:47:09,041
[ Mother ] What have you done
with the damn bird anyway?

1506
01:47:09,052 --> 01:47:10,234
[ Jud ] It's in the
bin where it belongs!

1507
01:47:10,257 --> 01:47:12,884
[ Mother ] Putting in t' bin!
Look what you've done to him now!

1508
01:47:12,969 --> 01:47:15,570
If I'd got hold of
him, he'd have been in!

1509
01:47:15,582 --> 01:47:16,512
Oh, yes, you!

1510
01:47:16,597 --> 01:47:18,993
That's just about your bloody power,
isn't it - killing a bird?

1511
01:47:19,016 --> 01:47:20,661
- Shut your face, will you!
- You shut your face!

1512
01:47:20,685 --> 01:47:22,769
Don't talk to me like that,
or I'll shut it for you!

1513
01:47:22,854 --> 01:47:24,854
Ah, well, it wouldn't hurt!

1514
01:47:24,939 --> 01:47:27,524
Don't tempt me too much, Jud,
'cause I'm sick of it now!

1515
01:47:27,609 --> 01:47:29,318
- Ah, shut up!
- And you!

1516
01:47:29,402 --> 01:47:31,235
I'm fed up with being in this bloody house!

1517
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:33,113
I'm fed up of seein' you in it!

1518
01:47:33,197 --> 01:47:37,408
Upsetting a kid like that!
Bloody pig, you are.

1519
01:48:19,911 --> 01:48:22,412
Look what he's done, Mum!
Look at it!

1520
01:48:22,497 --> 01:48:23,663
He's a right 'un.

1521
01:48:23,747 --> 01:48:25,498
That were a rotten trick anyway,
weren't it?

1522
01:48:25,582 --> 01:48:27,560
It were a rotten trick, what he did to me,
weren't it?

1523
01:48:27,585 --> 01:48:30,420
No need to take it out on a bird.
You could have took it out on me!

1524
01:48:30,505 --> 01:48:34,091
You know what a lot he thought about it.
Take it away from table anyway, Billy.

1525
01:48:34,175 --> 01:48:36,904
- But what are you gonna do to him?
- What do you want me to do to him?

1526
01:48:36,927 --> 01:48:38,568
- Give him a good hiding!
- "Give him a" -

1527
01:48:38,595 --> 01:48:40,096
What do you think you're doing?

1528
01:48:40,180 --> 01:48:42,265
[ Jud ]
I'd just like to see her, and all.

1529
01:48:42,350 --> 01:48:45,244
I'm fed up with the pair of you talkin'
about the damn thing! It's only a bird!

1530
01:48:45,269 --> 01:48:49,021
- You can get another, can't you?
- It's not worth a stinkin' threepence!

1531
01:48:51,024 --> 01:48:53,359
Get off! Get off!

1532
01:48:54,362 --> 01:48:56,445
Get out! Get out!

1533
01:48:56,530 --> 01:48:58,114
And don't come stinkin' back!
