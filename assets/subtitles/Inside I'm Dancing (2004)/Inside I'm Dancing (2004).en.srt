1
00:00:46,664 --> 00:00:49,833
A prima ballerina
is a ballet dancer,

2
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:53,837
the chief ballet dancer,
the most important dancer of all,

3
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:56,131
who dances all by herself.

4
00:01:03,639 --> 00:01:07,810
The marvellous, mechanical
prima ballerina.

5
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:07,828
Morning. Morning.
Anybody for Mass this morning?

6
00:02:12,249 --> 00:02:14,585
Mass? No?

7
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:18,630
Do you want to go to Mass?

8
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:23,927
The toilet?

9
00:02:25,804 --> 00:02:27,765
Try this.

10
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:33,687
First line?

11
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:36,190
A? B? C? C.

12
00:02:36,398 --> 00:02:39,068
First line? Second... CA?

13
00:02:39,318 --> 00:02:42,488
First line? Second line? First line?

14
00:02:42,738 --> 00:02:44,448
Cab?

15
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:46,367
First line? Second line?

16
00:02:46,617 --> 00:02:48,744
Look at these, aren't they beautiful?

17
00:02:48,994 --> 00:02:50,537
Cable?

18
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:52,956
Oh, my God.

19
00:02:53,165 --> 00:02:55,709
Jesus. Annie! Annie!

20
00:02:59,421 --> 00:03:03,300
Bagpuss gave a big yawn
and settled down to sleep.

21
00:03:37,626 --> 00:03:39,586
Hello, Rory.

22
00:03:39,837 --> 00:03:42,047
My name is Eileen Sheehy.

23
00:03:42,297 --> 00:03:44,967
I hope you're at home with us
here at Carrigmore.

24
00:03:45,175 --> 00:03:48,512
- Do I get a front-door key?
- We don't give front-door keys out.

25
00:03:48,971 --> 00:03:50,514
It's not home then, is it?

26
00:03:52,558 --> 00:03:54,518
Hello, everybody.

27
00:03:55,561 --> 00:03:59,231
We have Rory O'Shea,
who's come to live with us for a while.

28
00:04:00,274 --> 00:04:02,317
Now, just introduce yourself, Rory.

29
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:07,156
Rory O'Shea.
Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

30
00:04:07,573 --> 00:04:10,826
Besides the full vocal range,
I have the use of two fingers,

31
00:04:11,076 --> 00:04:13,829
sufficient for self-propulsion
and self-abuse.

32
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:17,875
Shake my hand or kiss my arse,
but don't expect me to reciprocate.

33
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,627
We don't tolerate
coarse language here, Rory.

34
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:31,764
Is it always this much fun,
or is today's somebody's birthday?

35
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:43,692
Was the penthouse not available?

36
00:04:44,068 --> 00:04:47,279
This is the only room.
People are queuing to get in.

37
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:49,490
And dying to get out.

38
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:53,118
I suppose it's only
a temporary arrangement.

39
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:03,837
Would you like
to go to bed now, Michael?

40
00:05:27,486 --> 00:05:30,906
- Well?
- Not at all.

41
00:05:31,156 --> 00:05:33,158
- What?
- Not a whisper.

42
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:03,689
- Is Dexter ill today?
- Dexter's in school.

43
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:05,899
I'm afraid he's not, Miss Fishborne.

44
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,569
Dexter's truancy problem
is way out of hand.

45
00:06:08,861 --> 00:06:11,739
The Baltimore County School Board
have decided to expel Dexter

46
00:06:11,989 --> 00:06:14,074
from the entire public school system.

47
00:06:25,627 --> 00:06:27,129
All right.

48
00:06:34,136 --> 00:06:37,931
Rory, you can't play loud music
in the middle of the night.

49
00:06:38,182 --> 00:06:40,142
Have you no respect for the others?

50
00:06:40,392 --> 00:06:42,561
They haven't earned my respect.

51
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,563
That's my music.

52
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,566
That's my fucking music!
I need to listen to that!

53
00:06:47,858 --> 00:06:50,903
If you continue this behaviour
I'll have to take this.

54
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,655
I'm getting my own home soon anyway.

55
00:06:53,906 --> 00:06:57,785
Until you do, you're here, OK?
And there are rules here.

56
00:06:58,035 --> 00:07:02,873
Aggression. Shouting.
Singing in the middle of the night? No!

57
00:07:03,165 --> 00:07:05,918
Have you no consideration
for other people?

58
00:07:06,168 --> 00:07:09,546
If they can hear me, at least
they know they're fucking alive.

59
00:07:09,797 --> 00:07:16,178
If you're alive, shout! Shout if you're
alive! Free the Carrigmore fucking One.

60
00:07:16,428 --> 00:07:19,890
Somebody shout!
She's stolen my stereo! It's robbery!

61
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,031
Are you going to paint something, Rory?

62
00:07:37,866 --> 00:07:39,827
Give us that.

63
00:07:47,251 --> 00:07:48,669
Finished.

64
00:07:53,465 --> 00:07:55,426
What are you looking at, Mary?

65
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:02,599
My Swahili's a bit off the boil.
Do you speak any English?

66
00:08:02,808 --> 00:08:05,894
Use your card, for Christ's sake!

67
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:07,938
I'll take that.

68
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:10,941
It's got the alphabet on it.
He spells out words.

69
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,652
- Does it take long?
- Half the fucking day.

70
00:08:13,902 --> 00:08:15,821
- Language, Tommy.
- Are you worth it?

71
00:08:16,822 --> 00:08:18,991
Are you worth the effort?

72
00:08:19,283 --> 00:08:21,452
Is there a mind in there?

73
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:24,455
Cerebral palsy. Fucks your brain.

74
00:08:24,747 --> 00:08:28,208
- Don't expect Einstein.
- You'd be Stephen Hawking then?

75
00:08:28,459 --> 00:08:32,546
There's nothing wrong with my brain.
It's the rest of me that's bollocksed.

76
00:08:32,796 --> 00:08:34,381
Ran my bike into a tree.

77
00:08:34,631 --> 00:08:36,925
Is that your most
intelligent act to date?

78
00:08:37,176 --> 00:08:39,178
Fuck off, the pair of you.

79
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,959
You all right?

80
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:15,464
We've got to take your measurement for
the sleep system we were talking about.

81
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:18,801
I'm going to try to get you
as straight as possible.

82
00:09:19,218 --> 00:09:21,345
Just relax.

83
00:09:21,553 --> 00:09:23,972
Just try to relax there. OK?

84
00:09:25,474 --> 00:09:27,434
So left side, 40.

85
00:09:29,353 --> 00:09:31,647
- 44.
- 44.

86
00:09:31,897 --> 00:09:33,315
Yeah.

87
00:09:35,234 --> 00:09:37,194
Right side, 39.

88
00:09:40,406 --> 00:09:41,490
49.

89
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,701
You all right, Michael?

90
00:09:52,668 --> 00:09:55,379
- How are yous?
- Are you looking for something, Rory?

91
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:57,089
Nah.

92
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:07,891
Are you enjoying that?

93
00:10:09,018 --> 00:10:11,770
You're all right.
Do you want me to get your card?

94
00:10:14,523 --> 00:10:16,191
I'll get your card.

95
00:10:16,608 --> 00:10:18,944
It's all right,
he just wants me to go away.

96
00:10:19,236 --> 00:10:21,363
He says I'm driving him up the wall.

97
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:23,615
Love to see you try that one, Mary.

98
00:10:24,033 --> 00:10:26,326
- Did you understand what he said?
- Yeah.

99
00:10:27,578 --> 00:10:29,705
OK, smart boy, guess who this is.

100
00:10:30,164 --> 00:10:32,374
Strict rules of golf, Goldfinger.

101
00:10:34,543 --> 00:10:37,463
- Emperor Hirohito of Japan.
- Emperor...

102
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:40,883
It's Roger Moore, you dope.
Here, I've a good one for you.

103
00:10:41,133 --> 00:10:43,093
Who am I being now?

104
00:10:46,096 --> 00:10:48,557
Er, don't know, Tommy,
who are you being now?

105
00:10:48,974 --> 00:10:51,060
Michael Connolly.

106
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:55,314
How are you, Michael?

107
00:10:58,067 --> 00:11:00,652
Er, yeah, I can understand you.

108
00:11:01,904 --> 00:11:03,572
How?

109
00:11:03,822 --> 00:11:06,075
I spent six years in a class
next to a kid

110
00:11:06,325 --> 00:11:09,244
that makes you sound like
Laurence fucking Olivier.

111
00:11:09,495 --> 00:11:12,456
What's he say now?

112
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,293
I think he said you were a prick.

113
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:19,380
Ah, fuck off, the pair of yous.

114
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:21,965
Look at you.

115
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,932
Will I tell...

116
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:35,479
Will I tell people what you say
with my gift?

117
00:11:36,438 --> 00:11:39,233
- My gift.
- Would you like your bath now?

118
00:11:39,483 --> 00:11:41,443
Only if you wash my gift.

119
00:11:43,946 --> 00:11:46,281
My gift.

120
00:11:46,532 --> 00:11:48,701
I'll give you a fucking gift.

121
00:12:01,255 --> 00:12:03,507
Annie, my hair gel's in the bag.

122
00:12:04,842 --> 00:12:09,430
Sorry, Mrs Sheehy says we haven't the
time to tease those spikes every day.

123
00:12:23,027 --> 00:12:26,864
Mary. Look what that bitch Delilah's
done to me.

124
00:12:27,698 --> 00:12:30,117
What are you laughing at?

125
00:12:31,827 --> 00:12:33,787
Not too much.
Are you listening to me?

126
00:12:36,331 --> 00:12:38,333
Start with the back of the head.

127
00:12:42,588 --> 00:12:45,799
You should think about
sprucing your image up a bit, Mary.

128
00:12:46,091 --> 00:12:48,052
It's all about looks these days.

129
00:12:48,302 --> 00:12:51,055
Who buys your clothes for you?

130
00:12:51,305 --> 00:12:52,306
Annie?

131
00:12:52,556 --> 00:12:55,225
Jesus. Have you ever
looked at what she wears?

132
00:12:55,476 --> 00:12:57,728
Do you not go and shop for yourself?

133
00:13:03,025 --> 00:13:05,152
I suppose you don't get out much,
do you?

134
00:13:08,197 --> 00:13:10,741
What's out there?

135
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:12,951
Out there is out there.

136
00:13:13,202 --> 00:13:15,162
I should be out there.

137
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:19,041
Don't you want to be like everyone else?

138
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:22,461
You know, get drunk...

139
00:13:23,462 --> 00:13:25,589
... get arrested, get laid.

140
00:13:26,715 --> 00:13:27,758
Huh?

141
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,227
How long you been living
in places like this?

142
00:13:38,477 --> 00:13:40,813
All your life?

143
00:13:42,231 --> 00:13:44,191
What crime did you commit?

144
00:13:46,527 --> 00:13:48,487
Unarmed robbery?

145
00:13:51,782 --> 00:13:54,743
Bit of a comedian,
are we, Mary?

146
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,250
Bottle of ketchup. An onion.

147
00:14:02,584 --> 00:14:06,505
Eileen.
See you've had your hair done as well.

148
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:11,343
Fashion's a cruel mistress.

149
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:51,216
- Very cosy, Son.
- It'll do for now.

150
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:56,096
Hey, come and meet my friend.
Dad, this is Hugh Grant.

151
00:14:56,388 --> 00:14:58,640
Pleased to meet you, Hugh.
How you doing?

152
00:15:02,061 --> 00:15:04,021
He says he likes your hat.

153
00:15:04,438 --> 00:15:06,774
- It's funny you mention this hat.
- Dad.

154
00:15:08,525 --> 00:15:11,695
This is a fine, big room
you have here, Hugh.

155
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:14,031
Fair play to you.

156
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:17,201
Oh, they're lovely.
Did you do them yourself?

157
00:15:17,451 --> 00:15:19,411
Dad, are you coming for a cup of tea?

158
00:15:19,703 --> 00:15:22,498
Right, Son. See you later, Hugh.

159
00:15:23,457 --> 00:15:25,501
Nice fella.

160
00:15:39,181 --> 00:15:41,266
- Did you see them on Wednesday?
- Nah.

161
00:15:41,517 --> 00:15:43,852
They don't have cable here.

162
00:15:44,103 --> 00:15:46,438
- I watched it in Mullins.
- Did you, yeah?

163
00:15:47,815 --> 00:15:50,234
They're very leaky at the back.

164
00:15:50,526 --> 00:15:52,611
And they've no width. None at all.

165
00:16:00,786 --> 00:16:03,038
This is better than the last place.

166
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,500
They're all the same.

167
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,797
- How's your breathing?
- In and out.

168
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:19,013
- If you wanted to come home...
- I'm all right, Dad.

169
00:16:19,471 --> 00:16:21,640
- It'd be no trouble.
- I'm all right.

170
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:29,565
Dad.

171
00:16:33,652 --> 00:16:35,988
Couldn't lend us some money,
could you?

172
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,240
I want to buy a suit.

173
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,918
My dad?

174
00:16:50,169 --> 00:16:52,129
Did you have a good look at him?

175
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:54,465
He can barely look after himself.

176
00:16:57,593 --> 00:17:00,304
What about you?
Where are your parents?

177
00:17:21,533 --> 00:17:23,660
Fergus Connolly.

178
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:25,579
Is that your dad?

179
00:17:28,332 --> 00:17:30,292
Does he come to see you?

180
00:17:33,087 --> 00:17:35,047
And your mother?

181
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,430
She died and he dumped you?

182
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:47,226
What a bastard.

183
00:17:50,479 --> 00:17:52,815
Does he know he has a secret fan club?

184
00:17:55,943 --> 00:18:00,406
Go on! Help the poor unfortunates.
Earn your place in heaven.

185
00:18:00,656 --> 00:18:05,244
You buy a cripple a Harley Davidson
you reduce the dependant population.

186
00:18:05,494 --> 00:18:07,496
Hey, how are you, love?
How are you?

187
00:18:07,913 --> 00:18:10,249
Give us some money.
You've got lovely legs.

188
00:18:11,709 --> 00:18:14,169
Hey, get your eyes off her.
I saw her first.

189
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:17,172
- You filthy mongrel.
- Thanks a lot.

190
00:18:21,593 --> 00:18:25,514
I've had more girlfriends
than you've had speech therapy sessions.

191
00:18:28,225 --> 00:18:31,186
I'm not exactly built
for long-term relationships.

192
00:18:31,437 --> 00:18:34,606
Anyhow, what about you?
Have you ever had your end away?

193
00:18:36,734 --> 00:18:39,528
Saving yourself
for the big wedding night, are you?

194
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,780
Very romantic, Michael.

195
00:18:42,197 --> 00:18:43,282
Thank you.

196
00:18:43,532 --> 00:18:45,951
Follow me.
I'll show you some real romance.

197
00:19:07,473 --> 00:19:09,683
Here, this'll do.

198
00:19:10,642 --> 00:19:12,811
See anyone you fancy?

199
00:19:20,027 --> 00:19:22,196
Over there.

200
00:19:22,446 --> 00:19:24,990
Keep your mouth shut.
I'll do the talking.

201
00:19:29,828 --> 00:19:33,832
Congratulations, you've been chosen
cripple companions of the month.

202
00:19:34,124 --> 00:19:37,920
I'm Rory, this is Michael, and we come
bearing treasure in our laps.

203
00:19:38,128 --> 00:19:40,672
- I've got a badge already.
- Here's the deal.

204
00:19:40,964 --> 00:19:44,301
We buy the drinks, you hold them for us.
How does that sound?

205
00:19:45,469 --> 00:19:49,098
- Sounds all right.
- Excellent. Take it out of this.

206
00:19:55,145 --> 00:19:58,524
No. It's for funding
the needs of the disabled.

207
00:19:58,774 --> 00:20:00,734
I'm disabled and I need a drink.

208
00:20:01,944 --> 00:20:04,238
Life is dishonest, Michael.

209
00:20:12,955 --> 00:20:14,581
There you go.

210
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,209
Thanks.

211
00:20:48,574 --> 00:20:50,826
We're in a show.
He sings, I dance.

212
00:20:51,076 --> 00:20:53,162
- I don't believe you.
- You better.

213
00:20:53,579 --> 00:20:56,957
- What's it about?
- These two guys in wheelchairs.

214
00:20:57,207 --> 00:21:00,878
They're not much to look at.
My character is quite handsome.

215
00:21:01,128 --> 00:21:04,089
And they go to a pub
and meet these two girls.

216
00:21:04,256 --> 00:21:07,342
And they kiss them.
And the girls fall in love with them.

217
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:10,763
- And they take them home.
- Thanks, lads. We have to go.

218
00:21:11,013 --> 00:21:12,931
I want to hear the end of the story.

219
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,935
- This is the end of the story.
- I'm just getting to the good bit.

220
00:21:17,186 --> 00:21:20,647
I can't go anywhere. I'm blocked.
I can barely stand up.

221
00:21:20,898 --> 00:21:23,108
You can't be as bad as us,
we're legless.

222
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:28,030
Hey, do you like that?
There's more where that came from.

223
00:21:29,615 --> 00:21:33,494
- You've lovely eyes.
- They're my second-best feature.

224
00:21:33,702 --> 00:21:35,704
Night.

225
00:21:55,474 --> 00:21:57,226
See ya.

226
00:22:01,605 --> 00:22:03,774
What did I tell ya? Eh?

227
00:22:04,858 --> 00:22:06,568
Same again?

228
00:22:08,821 --> 00:22:11,240
- Oh.
- Watch where you're going.

229
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:13,826
You're all right, none of it went on me.

230
00:22:14,076 --> 00:22:16,954
If I was in a wheelchair,
I wouldn't look for trouble?

231
00:22:17,204 --> 00:22:19,373
You starting?

232
00:22:20,374 --> 00:22:22,710
His mother sucks what?

233
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,420
Come here, you prick.

234
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:26,588
You bastard.

235
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:29,007
Picking on a fella in a wheelchair?!

236
00:22:32,302 --> 00:22:33,637
Fuck it.

237
00:22:33,887 --> 00:22:38,100
- He's not worth it. You're right.
- That's not what your girlfriend said.

238
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:41,937
Stop it. If he'd hit you in the mouth
you'd have nothing that works.

239
00:22:42,229 --> 00:22:45,858
I have a part or two below that might,
given the right stimulus.

240
00:22:46,275 --> 00:22:48,610
He wants to know your name.

241
00:22:48,902 --> 00:22:52,114
- Siobhan.
- He's Michael. I'm Trouble.

242
00:22:52,573 --> 00:22:55,117
- Yeah, I can see that.
- Listen, Siobhan.

243
00:22:55,325 --> 00:22:58,162
Could you help a poor cripple
out of a predicament?

244
00:22:58,454 --> 00:23:00,414
Depends on the predicament.

245
00:23:00,831 --> 00:23:03,500
I need someone to unzip my pants
and direct the hose.

246
00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:06,336
Michael wants to go home.

247
00:23:06,628 --> 00:23:10,424
- That isn't what I had in mind.
- Your mind isn't difficult to read.

248
00:23:12,593 --> 00:23:14,678
Hey. What you doing tomorrow night?

249
00:23:14,928 --> 00:23:17,765
Staying out of trouble.
So should you.

250
00:23:18,682 --> 00:23:21,352
Where's the fun in that?
We'd never have met you.

251
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,942
Beautiful? Yes, she is.

252
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:32,446
- Hey, girls.
- I love your dress.

253
00:23:39,536 --> 00:23:41,038
How are yous?

254
00:23:41,455 --> 00:23:43,874
Sorry, lads.
McGuvan's, round to the right.

255
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:48,003
- We've come to boogie.
- Not with them boots, you're not.

256
00:23:48,253 --> 00:23:50,297
Is that the club talking or is that you?

257
00:23:50,547 --> 00:23:52,883
Hey. On this door, I am the club.

258
00:23:59,223 --> 00:24:00,516
Is he all right?

259
00:24:00,766 --> 00:24:05,479
He says you're in breach
of EU Directive 739, Section 6B.

260
00:24:09,983 --> 00:24:12,778
Discrimination against
persons with disability.

261
00:24:14,071 --> 00:24:16,240
In places of public entertainment.

262
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:20,452
It's a 2,000 euro fine.

263
00:24:20,703 --> 00:24:24,081
Payable by the official denying entry.
That's you, pal.

264
00:24:25,249 --> 00:24:27,042
How are you, Garda?

265
00:24:28,419 --> 00:24:30,879
Look, I don't want
any trouble from the law.

266
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:34,675
You just bought yourself a load.
My friend is a barrister.

267
00:24:40,097 --> 00:24:42,349
Did you just make that up?

268
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:44,560
You little legal genius.

269
00:24:45,728 --> 00:24:51,567
Right. Inside. But remember for future
reference, wheelchair night's Monday.

270
00:24:51,817 --> 00:24:53,527
Keep by the fucking wall.

271
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:19,511
Come on, Michael. Yeah!

272
00:25:24,767 --> 00:25:26,894
Whoo!

273
00:25:29,563 --> 00:25:32,149
Whoo! Whoo!

274
00:25:39,698 --> 00:25:41,950
Come on, come and dance with me.

275
00:25:44,161 --> 00:25:47,206
Sure it's dancing!
What do you think I'm doing inside?

276
00:25:51,335 --> 00:25:53,295
Whoo!

277
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,374
Look who it is.

278
00:26:46,432 --> 00:26:48,767
Come on, Michael! Yes!

279
00:27:04,074 --> 00:27:06,201
Are you OK?

280
00:27:07,995 --> 00:27:09,955
Well, piss faster.

281
00:27:15,878 --> 00:27:17,171
Yeah.

282
00:27:18,547 --> 00:27:20,507
I was wet anyway.

283
00:27:27,139 --> 00:27:29,099
Have we got enough money for a taxi?

284
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:46,825
I'm sorry, Eileen, I told Michael
we should be getting back here,

285
00:27:47,076 --> 00:27:51,205
that you'd be worried about us,
but he insisted that we stay.

286
00:27:53,457 --> 00:27:56,001
That's what I heard, Michael.

287
00:27:56,251 --> 00:28:00,005
Let's face it, you're not that easy
to understand sometimes.

288
00:28:00,255 --> 00:28:02,424
You have to agree, Eileen.

289
00:28:02,674 --> 00:28:06,929
The collection had to be abandoned
because of you.

290
00:28:09,598 --> 00:28:11,558
And as for you, Michael...

291
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:15,020
... I am just so disappointed in you.

292
00:28:16,188 --> 00:28:18,649
You have never been any trouble before.

293
00:28:18,899 --> 00:28:21,026
It was my fault, Eileen.

294
00:28:22,528 --> 00:28:25,698
I led him astray,
and I've disgraced myself.

295
00:28:26,115 --> 00:28:28,117
Oh, yes, you have.

296
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:33,664
So if you just change my underpants,
we'll say no more about it.

297
00:29:02,693 --> 00:29:05,779
So er... I'm going out.

298
00:29:12,077 --> 00:29:14,371
Yeah, of course you can come.

299
00:29:14,621 --> 00:29:17,166
Do you possess a suit?

300
00:29:23,422 --> 00:29:24,590
Rory O'Shea.

301
00:29:30,095 --> 00:29:32,056
Hello again, Rory.

302
00:29:33,849 --> 00:29:36,935
This is Michael Connolly.
He's my lawyer.

303
00:29:38,437 --> 00:29:40,481
Oh, right.

304
00:29:40,773 --> 00:29:45,319
OK, this is your third application
for the independent living allowance.

305
00:29:45,569 --> 00:29:48,739
Your previous applications
were refused on the grounds

306
00:29:48,989 --> 00:29:51,867
that you were unsuited
for self-regulation

307
00:29:52,117 --> 00:29:56,330
and lacking responsibility
for the employment of others.

308
00:29:56,789 --> 00:30:00,167
Would you tell us what's changed
since your last application?

309
00:30:01,126 --> 00:30:06,507
Er, well, I... I'm learning
that I have a lot of energy.

310
00:30:07,591 --> 00:30:11,970
And I'm coming to terms
with learning to control that energy

311
00:30:12,429 --> 00:30:19,311
and use it for...
constructive, productive purposes.

312
00:30:20,687 --> 00:30:22,940
And I think that's progress.

313
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:25,192
Yeah, I... I think that's progress.

314
00:30:26,485 --> 00:30:31,031
Er, Rory...
you know our funds are very limited.

315
00:30:31,281 --> 00:30:32,574
Yeah.

316
00:30:32,825 --> 00:30:37,788
And er... we have to disperse them
in the wisest way possible.

317
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:39,998
- Mm-hm.
- OK.

318
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:44,586
Now I'm afraid that
we've heard a story

319
00:30:44,837 --> 00:30:49,883
concerning the mishandling
of some collection money.

320
00:30:53,387 --> 00:30:55,556
Rory, it's just this scheme demands

321
00:30:55,848 --> 00:30:59,768
a level of maturity and responsibility
from its candidates.

322
00:31:00,018 --> 00:31:03,188
Don't lecture me about maturity.
I'm not a fucking cheese.

323
00:31:03,605 --> 00:31:07,609
We're not sure independent
living is the best choice for you.

324
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,153
Choice?

325
00:31:10,529 --> 00:31:13,866
Is this an application
or has a choice already been made?

326
00:31:15,743 --> 00:31:19,621
Can I suggest we meet again
in six months to review the situation?

327
00:31:19,872 --> 00:31:23,625
Under EU Directive 5096...

328
00:31:25,836 --> 00:31:29,631
... discrimination against...
- I'm not sure I know that directive.

329
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,176
It means you have to do what I say.

330
00:31:32,468 --> 00:31:34,678
Or it's a 2,000 euro fine, isn't it?

331
00:31:34,928 --> 00:31:36,805
Isn't it?

332
00:31:37,431 --> 00:31:39,475
It's a 15,000 euro fine.

333
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:53,072
All I'm asking for is the chance
to live in my own home.

334
00:31:55,741 --> 00:31:58,243
- Are we agreed on six months?
- Six months!

335
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:02,289
Six months, Rory, it's not that long.

336
00:32:05,084 --> 00:32:07,169
Some fucking lawyer you are!

337
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:11,548
Open the door!

338
00:32:15,094 --> 00:32:17,471
Leave me alone.

339
00:32:17,721 --> 00:32:21,350
It's not OK. I have to get out of here!
I'm going to fucking die!

340
00:32:45,916 --> 00:32:48,877
Lovely to see everyone here
enjoying themselves.

341
00:32:50,003 --> 00:32:51,547
Hi, Annie.

342
00:32:52,756 --> 00:32:55,426
One false move and I'm yours.

343
00:32:55,676 --> 00:32:57,845
Sing this one. Here we go.

344
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:26,331
Have I done something
to make you unhappy here?

345
00:33:26,582 --> 00:33:28,375
No?

346
00:33:30,627 --> 00:33:32,921
Independent living isn't for everyone.

347
00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:38,469
You certainly won't get the
level of care you're used to here.

348
00:33:40,929 --> 00:33:45,768
If anything should happen to you,
God forbid, I won't be there.

349
00:33:47,394 --> 00:33:49,813
I'm appealing
because I am a marked man.

350
00:33:50,064 --> 00:33:52,024
- Slow down.
- I can't. Type faster.

351
00:33:52,483 --> 00:33:54,818
You've rejected my application
three times

352
00:33:55,027 --> 00:33:57,571
on the word of interfering,
dried-up bitches

353
00:33:57,863 --> 00:34:01,075
that wouldn't know responsibility
if it bit their fat arses.

354
00:34:01,325 --> 00:34:05,120
- Do you want to rethink that phrasing?
- Yeah, it needs to be punchier.

355
00:34:05,412 --> 00:34:07,373
Now type it.

356
00:34:08,582 --> 00:34:11,293
Hey, it's Judge Mumbles.
What you after?

357
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:15,297
- Michael Connolly.
- Ah, Michael, come in.

358
00:34:18,634 --> 00:34:20,594
Rory. Erm...

359
00:34:21,845 --> 00:34:25,140
If you don't mind, it's
Michael's application we're hearing.

360
00:34:25,432 --> 00:34:27,768
You'll hear it. You won't understand it.

361
00:34:28,018 --> 00:34:30,312
Rory, can you wait outside, please?

362
00:34:30,562 --> 00:34:34,983
Between us we've enough experience
of applicants with speech difficulties

363
00:34:35,275 --> 00:34:37,444
to be able to manage without you.

364
00:34:37,694 --> 00:34:39,613
Thanks, Rasheen.

365
00:34:39,863 --> 00:34:43,992
Now, Michael, the purpose of this chat

366
00:34:44,243 --> 00:34:46,995
is to assess what you believe
the philosophy to be

367
00:34:47,246 --> 00:34:49,373
behind independent living.

368
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:10,269
"Independent living allows me
to grow and mature as a person. "

369
00:35:14,231 --> 00:35:17,317
"It helps me fulfil
the potential within myself...

370
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:25,826
... which is not always realised
by institutional living. "

371
00:35:31,165 --> 00:35:35,002
"It opens the way for me
to make a real contribution...

372
00:35:37,171 --> 00:35:39,339
... and to live a fuller life. "

373
00:35:39,798 --> 00:35:42,051
Thank you, that's a very good answer.

374
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:47,514
Michael, you appreciate that
we will pay for a personal assistant,

375
00:35:47,806 --> 00:35:51,393
but you need to find accommodation.
Have you found somewhere?

376
00:35:53,979 --> 00:35:59,860
OK, well, in that case, I think
we can approve your application.

377
00:36:00,861 --> 00:36:02,863
There is just one concern.

378
00:36:03,155 --> 00:36:05,491
Your decision not to use speech aids.

379
00:36:05,908 --> 00:36:08,452
Will that not make things harder
in the long run?

380
00:36:12,873 --> 00:36:14,833
"I don't need speech aids...

381
00:36:19,546 --> 00:36:22,508
... as I will have
a full-time, live-in interpreter. "

382
00:36:27,388 --> 00:36:29,390
I'm sorry. Who?

383
00:36:30,933 --> 00:36:32,893
"Rory O'Shea. "

384
00:36:34,561 --> 00:36:36,522
Two for the price of one.

385
00:36:37,481 --> 00:36:40,275
I'm out! Can you hear me? I'm out!

386
00:36:40,526 --> 00:36:42,778
You hear that? I'm out!

387
00:36:43,028 --> 00:36:45,572
How did you come up with those answers?

388
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,121
You read their brochure?

389
00:36:52,371 --> 00:36:55,207
You read their brochure back to them?

390
00:36:55,457 --> 00:36:57,418
That's genius!

391
00:36:58,585 --> 00:37:01,004
All we need to do now is get a flat.

392
00:37:07,594 --> 00:37:09,388
How much?

393
00:37:09,638 --> 00:37:11,807
And also, the neighbours are very nice.

394
00:37:12,057 --> 00:37:14,226
- Are they quiet?
- Very quiet.

395
00:37:14,685 --> 00:37:16,854
You're really going to like this.

396
00:37:18,522 --> 00:37:20,482
Hey. Hey!

397
00:37:22,192 --> 00:37:24,737
There's a bit of a problem.
Can you guess what it is?

398
00:37:29,158 --> 00:37:31,493
It's a shame.
You would have loved the view.

399
00:37:31,785 --> 00:37:34,038
400 a month.

400
00:37:34,455 --> 00:37:37,624
Yeah, that's a two-bedroom flat,
city centre, yeah?

401
00:37:37,875 --> 00:37:40,210
Excellent. What's that?

402
00:37:42,379 --> 00:37:44,715
400 a week?

403
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:49,219
Right, we'll have a think about it
and get back to you.

404
00:37:49,511 --> 00:37:51,472
All right, bye-bye.

405
00:37:59,104 --> 00:38:02,900
Listen, Michael, do you really
want to leave Carrigmore?

406
00:38:11,742 --> 00:38:14,620
Would you be prepared
to do anything you could?

407
00:38:36,517 --> 00:38:38,644
- Fergus Connolly?
- Just in there.

408
00:38:43,565 --> 00:38:46,610
- Can I help you?
- Michael Connolly for Fergus Connolly.

409
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:49,738
- Do you have an appointment?
- He does, but he's late.

410
00:38:49,988 --> 00:38:53,158
- What time was it for?
- Er... 1981.

411
00:38:53,409 --> 00:38:57,121
- Traffic was murder.
- I'm sorry, Mr Connolly is not here.

412
00:39:00,416 --> 00:39:02,501
Really?

413
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:05,462
- Fergus Connolly! Fergus Connolly!
- Guard.

414
00:39:05,713 --> 00:39:09,842
I'm sorry, gentlemen,
I'm going to ask you to leave.

415
00:39:10,092 --> 00:39:12,052
They're causing a disturbance.

416
00:39:12,511 --> 00:39:15,806
Fergus, it's lovely to meet you.
I'm Rory O'Shea.

417
00:39:16,056 --> 00:39:18,058
This is Michael Connolly.

418
00:39:21,562 --> 00:39:25,149
We've come to report
a blatant case of criminal neglect.

419
00:39:29,695 --> 00:39:32,656
It's all right, guard, I'll handle this.
Thanks.

420
00:39:32,906 --> 00:39:34,908
Come on in.

421
00:39:37,536 --> 00:39:39,830
George, I'll see you later in Nesbits.

422
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,041
Bye-bye. Seven o'clock.

423
00:39:50,049 --> 00:39:52,009
It's a nice room.

424
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:59,433
- What do you want?
- Try asking him.

425
00:40:04,855 --> 00:40:06,982
Go on, he's waiting for you.

426
00:40:21,246 --> 00:40:23,415
He thinks you have
nothing in your head.

427
00:40:26,502 --> 00:40:28,087
Tell him.

428
00:40:40,307 --> 00:40:42,101
He's shy.

429
00:40:42,393 --> 00:40:44,353
And he's proud.

430
00:40:44,561 --> 00:40:47,481
Michael didn't even
want to come here today.

431
00:40:47,689 --> 00:40:49,983
For some reason
he thought it was demeaning

432
00:40:50,401 --> 00:40:52,986
to seek out the gobshite
that flushed him at birth.

433
00:40:53,278 --> 00:40:55,823
I had to persuade him.

434
00:41:00,828 --> 00:41:02,830
What do you need from me?

435
00:41:03,122 --> 00:41:09,336
Ground-floor flat, two bedrooms,
wheelchair access.

436
00:41:10,963 --> 00:41:12,923
Michael needs a home.

437
00:41:15,968 --> 00:41:17,928
What then?

438
00:41:24,435 --> 00:41:27,104
You'll get what you had
before we came in.

439
00:41:40,534 --> 00:41:42,035
OK.

440
00:42:07,019 --> 00:42:09,980
It wasn't planned
as a joyful family reunion.

441
00:42:13,609 --> 00:42:17,905
We went there to blackmail
the bastard. Mission accomplished.

442
00:42:18,197 --> 00:42:20,532
We got a home out of it.

443
00:42:22,493 --> 00:42:24,453
Somewhere we can live.

444
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:29,416
You'd better take it,
or we're both fucked.

445
00:42:32,086 --> 00:42:34,046
Trust me, Michael.

446
00:42:35,255 --> 00:42:37,174
It'll be worth it.

447
00:42:39,176 --> 00:42:41,136
It'll be worth it.

448
00:42:55,776 --> 00:42:57,986
Right, lads, there yous are.

449
00:42:58,237 --> 00:43:00,656
Come on in now till I show you.

450
00:43:02,866 --> 00:43:05,119
Ah. Ah, this is amazing.

451
00:43:05,369 --> 00:43:08,414
- This is amazing.
- Bedroom number one.

452
00:43:08,664 --> 00:43:11,583
This one's mine! This one's mine!

453
00:43:11,834 --> 00:43:13,627
Shower. The whole shebang.

454
00:43:15,087 --> 00:43:16,672
Kitchen.

455
00:43:16,922 --> 00:43:18,841
Lefty.

456
00:43:19,091 --> 00:43:21,760
There you are, all mod cons for you.

457
00:43:21,969 --> 00:43:24,138
A few bits and pieces still to go in.

458
00:43:26,098 --> 00:43:28,058
And the living room.

459
00:43:28,308 --> 00:43:30,227
Lovely colours.

460
00:43:30,477 --> 00:43:34,481
Now, the lighting
can be voice activated.

461
00:43:34,732 --> 00:43:36,984
This switch here if you want to use it.

462
00:43:38,569 --> 00:43:40,279
On!

463
00:43:41,113 --> 00:43:43,073
Off!

464
00:43:50,539 --> 00:43:54,626
Right, well, if there's nothing else,
I'll leave the keys with you, boys.

465
00:43:55,043 --> 00:43:56,628
Right?

466
00:43:57,045 --> 00:43:59,131
Lefty. Lefty!

467
00:43:59,381 --> 00:44:01,341
Is that my paper?

468
00:44:03,552 --> 00:44:05,512
No rules.

469
00:44:08,057 --> 00:44:10,517
No rules, no Delilah.

470
00:44:13,062 --> 00:44:17,191
No interfering old bitches.
Just you and me in cripple heaven.

471
00:44:18,442 --> 00:44:21,153
Freedom!

472
00:44:26,867 --> 00:44:31,538
So after 16 years' military service
I felt a change was required.

473
00:44:31,789 --> 00:44:33,999
I want to do some humanitarian work.

474
00:44:34,249 --> 00:44:36,919
Could you straighten up
while I'm talking to you?

475
00:44:37,169 --> 00:44:40,339
Well now, aren't you great lads
for giving this a bash?

476
00:44:40,631 --> 00:44:43,008
Trying it on your own. Why not?

477
00:44:43,258 --> 00:44:46,470
Jesus loves you, Michael.
Jesus loves you, Rory.

478
00:44:46,762 --> 00:44:50,349
My work with you people
would be an expression of that love.

479
00:44:52,643 --> 00:44:54,895
Will I have to push
you two around all day?

480
00:44:55,145 --> 00:44:59,566
Spaghetti bolognese, that sort
of thing. I've a recipe for that.

481
00:44:59,817 --> 00:45:02,152
... cookies.

482
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,200
We'll have a great laugh.
I'm great fun to be around.

483
00:45:23,173 --> 00:45:25,134
Do yous ever dress up?

484
00:45:25,384 --> 00:45:28,303
I mean, as animals, or whatever.

485
00:45:28,554 --> 00:45:30,389
No.

486
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:32,015
Not really.

487
00:45:33,642 --> 00:45:37,813
- We could though, if...
- No, I have a real problem with that.

488
00:45:40,023 --> 00:45:43,986
Jesus, there's no way
he's working for us.

489
00:45:44,236 --> 00:45:46,989
You know when something
just makes you feel sick?

490
00:45:50,033 --> 00:45:52,369
What you doing?

491
00:46:10,429 --> 00:46:13,974
Siobhan, have you not done
the Pot Noodles yet? Get a move on.

492
00:46:35,537 --> 00:46:36,830
How are you?

493
00:46:37,081 --> 00:46:39,875
No. I'm not qualified.

494
00:46:40,125 --> 00:46:43,378
You have the best qualifications
we've seen in a long time.

495
00:46:43,629 --> 00:46:45,631
- Really?
- Definitely.

496
00:46:48,467 --> 00:46:51,678
- I already have a job.
- Yeah, you do, stacking shelves.

497
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:54,890
It's temporary.

498
00:46:58,185 --> 00:47:00,187
- Who would I be working for?
- Me.

499
00:47:02,064 --> 00:47:04,024
Him. Me and him.

500
00:47:04,983 --> 00:47:06,944
Come on, we'd be no trouble.

501
00:47:07,194 --> 00:47:10,155
He can hardly talk
and I'm pretty quiet myself.

502
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:13,450
Oh, Jesus, I don't know.

503
00:47:13,742 --> 00:47:18,247
- I've never done anything like this.
- Excellent. Neither have we.

504
00:47:34,596 --> 00:47:36,557
We're fucking off.

505
00:47:37,015 --> 00:47:38,809
The pair of us.

506
00:47:39,226 --> 00:47:40,769
With her?

507
00:47:43,313 --> 00:47:45,649
Good man.

508
00:47:53,866 --> 00:47:55,284
See yous.

509
00:47:56,243 --> 00:48:00,080
Hey, Delilah,
we've paid our debt to society,

510
00:48:00,372 --> 00:48:03,500
we've learned our lesson,
you won't be seeing us back.

511
00:48:05,335 --> 00:48:07,671
Michael, a little something for you.

512
00:48:08,714 --> 00:48:13,051
And you know that if things don't work
out for you you're always welcome here.

513
00:48:13,469 --> 00:48:15,471
Goodbye, Michael.

514
00:48:16,388 --> 00:48:18,348
Goodbye, Rory.

515
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:24,563
I know we haven't always
gotten along, Eileen,

516
00:48:25,022 --> 00:48:28,067
and if I've said anything
to offend you at any time...

517
00:48:29,193 --> 00:48:31,612
... then er... then good.

518
00:48:45,084 --> 00:48:47,419
It'll all end in tears.

519
00:48:47,669 --> 00:48:49,630
Bye, Michael. Bye, Rory.

520
00:49:24,581 --> 00:49:27,751
- Hey, this is all right.
- Yeah. It's bigger than it looks.

521
00:49:28,794 --> 00:49:31,797
- Where'll I put this?
- Stick it in there on my bed.

522
00:49:33,298 --> 00:49:36,885
- They've delivered the telly.
- That's a big bed for a little man.

523
00:49:40,347 --> 00:49:43,767
- Raging Speed Horn?
- Yeah, stick it on and make some tea.

524
00:49:47,146 --> 00:49:49,815
Oh, champagne. Fantastic.

525
00:49:52,609 --> 00:49:56,905
All right. Siobhan, we'll have some
goat's cheese, some Casher Blue,

526
00:49:57,156 --> 00:50:00,242
some St Brendan brie
and some of the holy Swiss stuff.

527
00:50:00,534 --> 00:50:04,621
Is that foie gras? Excuse me,
is that... ? We'll have some foie gras.

528
00:50:05,038 --> 00:50:07,166
We'll have some venison patй.

529
00:50:07,416 --> 00:50:09,668
We will have some truffles.

530
00:50:17,134 --> 00:50:20,095
There you are.
That's 415. 28 euros, please.

531
00:50:23,348 --> 00:50:26,810
Yeah, definitely,
this spicy one's really good.

532
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:30,189
Michael, you should try this one.

533
00:50:32,316 --> 00:50:35,319
Who the fuck... ?

534
00:50:35,569 --> 00:50:37,988
- OK, you all right?
- Just got to lift it up now.

535
00:50:38,447 --> 00:50:40,491
- Come on.
- OK. You're comfortable?

536
00:50:40,741 --> 00:50:42,493
- Yeah, yeah.
- OK.

537
00:50:42,743 --> 00:50:46,038
- You're doing good.
- Are you being sarcastic? Fuck you.

538
00:50:50,375 --> 00:50:53,087
You all right?

539
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:58,736
Oh, wait, I'll be back in a minute.

540
00:51:58,986 --> 00:52:01,280
What? Siobhan.

541
00:52:01,530 --> 00:52:03,574
OK, I've got it.

542
00:52:06,618 --> 00:52:08,120
OK?

543
00:52:10,414 --> 00:52:13,584
Oh! Fuck! Shit! Bollocks!

544
00:52:25,053 --> 00:52:27,431
Yes?

545
00:52:31,143 --> 00:52:33,437
Do you have a boyfriend?

546
00:52:33,729 --> 00:52:35,856
Er, I used to.

547
00:52:38,942 --> 00:52:41,528
- Did I what?
- Did you love him?

548
00:52:42,863 --> 00:52:44,281
Yeah.

549
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:51,080
Did you want to marry him?

550
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:54,208
I never really thought about it.

551
00:52:54,458 --> 00:52:57,169
Come on, now,
did he break your little heart?

552
00:52:57,419 --> 00:53:01,256
- Do you want to go under a bus?
- Do you want to go under a wheelchair?

553
00:53:01,548 --> 00:53:03,801
Yeah, shut up, Rory.

554
00:53:04,051 --> 00:53:06,011
Yeah, shut up, Rory.

555
00:53:10,099 --> 00:53:12,059
Here, listen to this.

556
00:53:12,309 --> 00:53:14,061
I really like this song.

557
00:53:20,192 --> 00:53:22,528
- Can I ask you something?
- Mm-hm.

558
00:53:24,947 --> 00:53:26,990
Were you born like this?

559
00:53:28,826 --> 00:53:32,204
- Like what?
- Dodgy hair and shit taste in music.

560
00:53:34,748 --> 00:53:38,127
No. No, that's something
I've had to work long and hard at.

561
00:53:54,726 --> 00:53:56,520
Will I do your hair?

562
00:54:58,665 --> 00:55:01,460
Mister. Are you a goblin?

563
00:55:01,752 --> 00:55:03,712
No, I'm not a fucking goblin.

564
00:55:03,962 --> 00:55:05,923
- Is that an electric chair?
- Yeah.

565
00:55:06,381 --> 00:55:08,634
Bet you it's not as fast as my scooter.

566
00:55:10,469 --> 00:55:12,262
How much money have you got?

567
00:55:13,972 --> 00:55:18,268
It's important there's no cheating.
Nobody go till I say go. All right?

568
00:55:19,186 --> 00:55:22,398
Ready, steady, go.

569
00:55:31,907 --> 00:55:33,826
Get your hands in your pockets.

570
00:55:34,076 --> 00:55:35,160
Come on!

571
00:56:09,403 --> 00:56:11,238
- Come on!
- Come on!

572
00:56:14,908 --> 00:56:16,618
Battery!

573
00:56:23,459 --> 00:56:27,004
- How could you lose that?
- You should have won that.

574
00:56:27,254 --> 00:56:29,214
- You cheated.
- And we still beat you.

575
00:56:29,465 --> 00:56:32,217
Yeah, yeah, whatever.
Next time, babyface.

576
00:56:38,265 --> 00:56:40,225
- Compound.
- Compound.

577
00:56:40,476 --> 00:56:42,728
- Go again.
- Compound.

578
00:56:45,147 --> 00:56:47,107
Hello?

579
00:56:50,652 --> 00:56:52,821
Beast.

580
00:56:56,116 --> 00:56:58,077
Siobhan.

581
00:57:00,662 --> 00:57:03,415
Am I hibernating?
Is this me till spring?

582
00:57:03,665 --> 00:57:06,210
What is that? I'll be there in a minute.

583
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:09,963
All right. I'll make myself a cup of tea
while I'm waiting.

584
00:57:10,214 --> 00:57:12,549
If you like.

585
00:57:18,764 --> 00:57:20,891
Rory, can you turn it down?

586
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:26,563
We can't hear ourselves think.

587
00:57:26,814 --> 00:57:29,733
What do you have to think about?
Hey, hey, hey.

588
00:57:30,776 --> 00:57:34,738
This is my room, that's my music and
I want to listen to it. Turn it back on.

589
00:57:34,988 --> 00:57:38,659
This may be your room, but it's
his flat. We need to have some rules.

590
00:57:38,909 --> 00:57:43,080
- Rules? Fuck your rules.
- God, he's a moody bollocks, isn't he?

591
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:47,376
- I won't have you imposing rules on me.
- What? He's the best?

592
00:57:47,668 --> 00:57:51,797
- Michael, tell her to come back here.
- I better go and sort him out.

593
00:57:52,214 --> 00:57:54,133
Siobhan!

594
00:57:54,383 --> 00:57:56,927
- What?
- It's not your job to make rules.

595
00:57:57,344 --> 00:57:59,346
Your job's to do what we tell you to do.

596
00:57:59,638 --> 00:58:03,767
I do the interpreting. You do the
cleaning, make the tea and cleaning up.

597
00:58:05,352 --> 00:58:07,396
You are our servant, Siobhan.

598
00:58:09,398 --> 00:58:11,108
Our skiwy.

599
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,360
Our slave.

600
00:58:13,610 --> 00:58:16,196
Will you shut up,
or do I have to make you?

601
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:18,449
I'd like to see you try.

602
00:58:21,368 --> 00:58:25,330
Just remember, you're a servant too.

603
00:58:26,915 --> 00:58:29,042
Mr Interpreter.

604
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:37,426
OK, where were we?

605
00:58:42,222 --> 00:58:44,183
Will you hold that, Michael?

606
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:34,900
I'll be back in a minute.

607
00:59:45,077 --> 00:59:47,204
What's the matter with you?

608
00:59:52,418 --> 00:59:54,378
Did you get a hard-on?

609
00:59:54,628 --> 00:59:56,588
Come on. What did she do?

610
01:00:10,394 --> 01:00:12,938
Ho! Did you see that, Michael?

611
01:00:13,188 --> 01:00:15,232
That was life passing you by.

612
01:00:15,482 --> 01:00:17,443
Come on, let's go out.

613
01:00:22,239 --> 01:00:25,284
You're waiting for Siobhan? What for?

614
01:00:25,534 --> 01:00:29,371
What you going to do, sit in here
and have her do everything for you?

615
01:00:29,621 --> 01:00:31,749
Come on, let's go out.

616
01:00:36,336 --> 01:00:38,338
Fine. See you later.

617
01:00:39,923 --> 01:00:41,884
You know what you're doing?

618
01:00:43,177 --> 01:00:46,138
You're building a little Carrigmore
for yourself.

619
01:01:28,555 --> 01:01:30,474
You looking for your friend?

620
01:01:30,724 --> 01:01:32,684
He'll be back in a minute.

621
01:01:49,284 --> 01:01:51,578
- You fuck!
- Out of the car.

622
01:01:51,995 --> 01:01:55,457
- I'm a cripple.
- You'll be a cripple tonight if...

623
01:01:55,707 --> 01:01:58,710
Look, that's my chair.
Careful! It's my fucking chair!

624
01:02:03,882 --> 01:02:05,843
I'll erm...

625
01:02:07,511 --> 01:02:09,847
Who's in charge of you?

626
01:02:10,139 --> 01:02:12,433
Hey, shut...
No fucker's in charge of me!

627
01:02:13,976 --> 01:02:16,478
Put him back in his chair.
Get this car out of here.

628
01:02:16,895 --> 01:02:18,981
- Aren't you going to arrest me?
- No.

629
01:02:19,231 --> 01:02:23,402
That's discrimination. You're only
doing that because I'm disabled.

630
01:02:23,652 --> 01:02:26,613
- It's my civil right to be arrested.
- Look, just...

631
01:02:27,739 --> 01:02:30,576
Name and address.
We'll leave it at that, right?

632
01:02:30,868 --> 01:02:33,829
You'll have to kick it out of me,
you bastard.

633
01:02:36,290 --> 01:02:37,791
Hey.

634
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,793
What?

635
01:02:40,085 --> 01:02:43,464
Rory's a what?

636
01:02:47,926 --> 01:02:49,678
- Hi.
- Yeah?

637
01:02:49,970 --> 01:02:52,514
I'm here for Rory O'Shea.
He's in a wheelchair.

638
01:02:52,765 --> 01:02:55,058
Him? We let him go
about half an hour ago.

639
01:02:55,476 --> 01:02:56,685
Oh, what?

640
01:02:56,935 --> 01:02:59,605
I offered to take him home
but he wouldn't come.

641
01:03:00,856 --> 01:03:03,066
- Did he say where he was going?
- No.

642
01:03:16,955 --> 01:03:18,791
Hey. Hey!

643
01:03:19,041 --> 01:03:21,794
You little fucking shit,
give me my hat back.

644
01:03:22,044 --> 01:03:24,713
- Come and get it.
- Give me my hat or I'll kill you.

645
01:03:24,963 --> 01:03:27,174
Come on or I'll run you over,
you little...

646
01:03:27,424 --> 01:03:30,511
- You have to catch me. Come and get it.
- Fuck! Hey!

647
01:03:30,928 --> 01:03:32,888
Come here!

648
01:03:37,434 --> 01:03:39,394
Thanks for the hat.

649
01:03:42,773 --> 01:03:45,859
This is the midnight news
from Lorne O'Brian.

650
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:50,656
Six armed nationals
were in custody tonight following...

651
01:03:50,906 --> 01:03:52,908
Do you want some more tea?

652
01:03:55,411 --> 01:03:57,996
Rory O'Shea, in the house.

653
01:04:05,379 --> 01:04:07,673
Where were you?

654
01:04:07,923 --> 01:04:10,634
Michael was worried sick about you.

655
01:04:10,884 --> 01:04:13,220
Were you worried about me, Michael?

656
01:04:14,721 --> 01:04:16,723
Escaping from jail.

657
01:04:17,015 --> 01:04:21,478
I was down to go at 11. 30. I'm not
charging you, but I have my own life.

658
01:04:21,728 --> 01:04:23,647
And I haven't?

659
01:04:23,897 --> 01:04:27,359
- That's not what I meant.
- It wasn't her fault?

660
01:04:27,609 --> 01:04:30,779
Your knight in shining pyjamas
says I have to leave you alone.

661
01:04:31,029 --> 01:04:36,201
Five minutes. I can either get you ready
for bed or you can slag the both of us.

662
01:04:36,618 --> 01:04:39,788
- Up to you, but...
- Come back, Delilah, all is forgiven.

663
01:04:42,207 --> 01:04:44,918
Don't you lecture me
about responsibility.

664
01:04:45,127 --> 01:04:48,714
If it wasn't for me you'd be sitting
in your own shite in Carrigmore

665
01:04:49,131 --> 01:04:51,133
spelling out "toilet" on that card.

666
01:04:51,425 --> 01:04:53,761
- Don't say that.
- Don't tell me what to do.

667
01:05:34,426 --> 01:05:36,386
I don't want your help.

668
01:05:36,678 --> 01:05:39,556
I don't want anyone's help.

669
01:08:12,835 --> 01:08:14,795
Rory.

670
01:08:16,755 --> 01:08:18,715
What?

671
01:08:28,058 --> 01:08:29,518
No.

672
01:08:29,768 --> 01:08:32,521
She's not on our side.

673
01:08:33,647 --> 01:08:36,525
She's paid to do what we tell her to do.

674
01:08:40,737 --> 01:08:45,117
Well, I really like her.

675
01:08:47,453 --> 01:08:49,413
A lot.

676
01:08:51,165 --> 01:08:53,125
Oh, Michael, man.

677
01:08:54,251 --> 01:08:56,754
You haven't told her how you feel,
have you?

678
01:09:01,467 --> 01:09:02,760
Help you?

679
01:09:05,929 --> 01:09:07,890
Help you what?

680
01:09:10,058 --> 01:09:12,394
Help you make a prick of yourself?

681
01:09:14,313 --> 01:09:17,107
What have you got to offer
a woman like that?

682
01:09:18,484 --> 01:09:20,527
Cop on to yourself.

683
01:09:20,778 --> 01:09:24,782
Get a tape recorder
and fucking listen to yourself.

684
01:09:25,032 --> 01:09:28,869
Stop for a minute
and take a look at yourself in a mirror.

685
01:09:54,144 --> 01:09:56,730
You boys really need some new clothes.

686
01:10:01,401 --> 01:10:02,903
Thank you.

687
01:10:05,531 --> 01:10:07,658
How are you, Hugh?

688
01:10:08,117 --> 01:10:09,910
Hello there.

689
01:10:13,831 --> 01:10:17,126
- Might be a bit early for this.
- Jesus, never too early, Dad.

690
01:10:17,584 --> 01:10:19,002
In you get.

691
01:10:22,798 --> 01:10:25,259
Fair play to you.
A place of your own.

692
01:10:25,509 --> 01:10:27,970
It's not really mine, Dad.

693
01:10:36,728 --> 01:10:38,981
Happy birthday, Son.
The key to the door.

694
01:10:39,231 --> 01:10:41,442
- What have I told you?
- Listen, Son...

695
01:10:41,692 --> 01:10:43,610
Dad...

696
01:10:46,029 --> 01:10:48,031
Congratulations. Well done.

697
01:10:51,452 --> 01:10:55,414
It's all gone so quickly.
And I wish I could help.

698
01:11:02,755 --> 01:11:06,925
Siobhan. Hey.
You look great. How's it going?

699
01:11:07,176 --> 01:11:09,845
- Great, yeah.
- Great.

700
01:11:10,053 --> 01:11:13,140
This is Michael. Declan.

701
01:11:15,058 --> 01:11:18,270
Great. Look, I'm having a party
on Saturday night.

702
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:21,023
It's fancy dress. You should come.

703
01:11:21,231 --> 01:11:24,651
I dunno, I've...

704
01:11:27,362 --> 01:11:29,364
You want to go?

705
01:11:29,573 --> 01:11:32,785
Great. I got to go,
but I'll see you around nine.

706
01:11:33,035 --> 01:11:36,079
- And the doorbell's broken.
- I know.

707
01:11:38,415 --> 01:11:40,375
Oh, there's another fella.

708
01:11:40,667 --> 01:11:43,170
Bring him along. The more the merrier.

709
01:11:47,925 --> 01:11:49,885
Hey, a party.

710
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:55,057
- Ho!
- Hello, Dr Strangelove.

711
01:11:55,474 --> 01:11:58,143
Are you sure that's what
Florence Nightingale wore?

712
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,354
Who cares?

713
01:12:02,481 --> 01:12:04,817
- Ho, ho.
- Hello.

714
01:12:06,276 --> 01:12:08,612
- Doesn't he look handsome?
- He looks great.

715
01:12:23,794 --> 01:12:25,796
Be careful.

716
01:12:27,047 --> 01:12:29,967
Someone might think
tonight's their lucky night.

717
01:12:54,158 --> 01:12:57,202
Siobhan. Great to see you.

718
01:12:57,453 --> 01:12:59,163
Michael, fair play to you.

719
01:12:59,455 --> 01:13:02,166
- This is Rory.
- How you doing? Having a good time?

720
01:13:02,374 --> 01:13:04,543
- Yeah, great party...
- Come on.

721
01:13:13,427 --> 01:13:15,429
Who's the prick?

722
01:13:45,667 --> 01:13:47,628
... this is the war room.

723
01:13:47,878 --> 01:13:51,590
- That's a very good impression.
- I love Peter Sellers.

724
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:53,759
Michael.

725
01:13:54,009 --> 01:13:58,597
He plays Chauncey Gardener
or something like that.

726
01:14:10,025 --> 01:14:12,694
Come on.

727
01:14:44,768 --> 01:14:46,728
Fancy a go at the karaoke, Michael?

728
01:14:53,861 --> 01:14:55,821
What did he say?

729
01:14:57,239 --> 01:14:59,158
Of course I will.

730
01:15:05,247 --> 01:15:07,207
Don't tread on my feet.

731
01:15:17,092 --> 01:15:19,428
- Who's your man?
- She looks after him.

732
01:15:50,709 --> 01:15:52,669
No, no.

733
01:15:52,961 --> 01:15:54,922
Michael.

734
01:15:56,590 --> 01:15:58,509
Sorry. I'm really sorry.

735
01:16:06,767 --> 01:16:08,727
- I'm fine.
- You sure?

736
01:16:57,860 --> 01:17:00,154
Is your phone charged?

737
01:17:00,404 --> 01:17:02,322
I'll say good night then.

738
01:17:08,245 --> 01:17:10,414
I love you.

739
01:17:10,664 --> 01:17:13,709
I'm sorry, Michael, but...

740
01:17:18,672 --> 01:17:21,175
"Do you have any feelings for me?"

741
01:17:22,885 --> 01:17:27,347
Michael, I'm paid
to do what I do for you.

742
01:17:30,726 --> 01:17:32,853
That's my job.

743
01:17:33,061 --> 01:17:38,108
That isn't love. And what you
feel for me, that isn't love either.

744
01:17:38,525 --> 01:17:40,736
It's gratitude.

745
01:17:44,865 --> 01:17:47,326
I like working for you, but...

746
01:17:48,619 --> 01:17:50,579
... it is just a job.

747
01:17:55,417 --> 01:17:59,963
There isn't anything else going on here,
Michael, do you understand?

748
01:18:02,299 --> 01:18:05,177
There isn't anything else going on.

749
01:18:30,744 --> 01:18:32,746
I'm not hungry.

750
01:19:02,484 --> 01:19:05,779
This is Peter. He's a qualified PA.

751
01:19:06,113 --> 01:19:09,283
He'll be looking after you
until you find someone else.

752
01:19:09,533 --> 01:19:12,494
Really? Well, he won't do.

753
01:19:12,703 --> 01:19:15,080
Michael likes them with bigger tits.

754
01:19:18,208 --> 01:19:21,753
Michael, I made a mistake.
I thought I could do this, but...

755
01:19:24,047 --> 01:19:26,216
I'm leaving.

756
01:19:32,639 --> 01:19:34,767
Don't beg, it's undignified.

757
01:19:37,561 --> 01:19:41,106
Parakeets don't mate with armadillos,
that's the end of it.

758
01:19:41,523 --> 01:19:44,610
- That's a filthy thing to tell him.
- Is it?

759
01:19:46,361 --> 01:19:49,531
- It's the truth.
- Oh, it's the truth you want? OK.

760
01:19:49,907 --> 01:19:53,160
To be equal you must show
the same respect you demand.

761
01:19:53,410 --> 01:19:57,247
If you insult some guy in the pub,
you expect to get hammered.

762
01:19:57,539 --> 01:20:00,793
If you come home late
you don't expect the help to be waiting.

763
01:20:01,043 --> 01:20:04,588
If a woman says no, you accept
you're not the right man for her.

764
01:20:04,838 --> 01:20:08,133
You don't have a right to love
because you're in a wheelchair.

765
01:20:08,383 --> 01:20:11,845
Siobhan. You said you were going,
I think you should go.

766
01:20:13,388 --> 01:20:17,893
- Fuck off. I mean it.
- Your disability is you're an arsehole.

767
01:20:21,730 --> 01:20:24,900
Why does everything
always have to be a fight with you?

768
01:20:27,736 --> 01:20:31,573
I can't help who I love.
I can't help who I don't love.

769
01:20:37,454 --> 01:20:39,581
It's not my fault, Michael.

770
01:20:45,254 --> 01:20:46,839
Let her go.

771
01:20:47,256 --> 01:20:49,216
Michael, let her go.

772
01:20:57,349 --> 01:20:59,184
Let her go.

773
01:21:12,322 --> 01:21:14,741
Where you going?

774
01:21:14,992 --> 01:21:17,494
This is your home, Michael.

775
01:21:25,169 --> 01:21:27,129
Michael.

776
01:21:34,136 --> 01:21:37,222
Are you going back to Carrigmore?

777
01:21:37,473 --> 01:21:41,435
It's suicide. I don't have time
to kill myself that slowly,

778
01:21:41,685 --> 01:21:45,481
so if you're going back I might as well
throw myself in this river.

779
01:21:50,402 --> 01:21:53,989
You didn't fuck it up. We fucked it up.

780
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:57,201
The pair of us. Nobody did it for us.

781
01:22:12,966 --> 01:22:14,885
I know it hurts.

782
01:22:19,223 --> 01:22:21,558
You're not the only one
with a broken heart.

783
01:22:30,776 --> 01:22:32,903
You have the future, Michael.

784
01:22:35,781 --> 01:22:38,158
That's what I call a gift.

785
01:22:42,287 --> 01:22:44,248
Don't give it up.

786
01:22:46,333 --> 01:22:48,293
You can't give it up.

787
01:22:57,136 --> 01:22:59,805
Shit, you've got the whole world
in your hands.

788
01:23:23,328 --> 01:23:25,289
You're fucking wet as well.

789
01:23:38,177 --> 01:23:41,263
Our home?
Or am I going in the fucking river?

790
01:23:53,358 --> 01:23:55,861
Yeah, it is too high.

791
01:23:56,111 --> 01:23:59,573
Take a letter, Michael.
To Dublin City Council.

792
01:23:59,865 --> 01:24:04,620
Dear sir or madam, as wheelchair users
with suicidal intentions,

793
01:24:04,870 --> 01:24:07,414
I must protest
at the lack of facilities.

794
01:24:07,664 --> 01:24:11,168
None of the bridges are equipped
with easy parapet access.

795
01:24:11,585 --> 01:24:15,214
Thus curtailing the rights
of the disabled to throw themselves in.

796
01:24:15,464 --> 01:24:19,927
Yours in disgust, Rory Gerard O'Shea
and Michael Connolly.

797
01:24:20,219 --> 01:24:23,180
Keep going, tell them.

798
01:24:30,437 --> 01:24:32,439
Do you like to study?

799
01:24:34,608 --> 01:24:37,694
Maybe you ought to
go to college some day.

800
01:24:41,281 --> 01:24:43,951
Part time or something like that.

801
01:24:46,328 --> 01:24:49,164
University? At home? That would be good.

802
01:24:51,208 --> 01:24:53,210
Me, I'd like to study medicine.

803
01:24:58,048 --> 01:25:00,592
Yap, yap, yap.

804
01:25:04,012 --> 01:25:07,015
Guys. You have a nice home here,
you know.

805
01:25:09,643 --> 01:25:13,063
But you shouldn't watch
too much TV, yeah?

806
01:25:13,313 --> 01:25:16,692
It's bad for the mind,
and bad for the eyesight.

807
01:25:16,942 --> 01:25:19,695
Why don't we go for a walk?
It's a beautiful day.

808
01:25:22,072 --> 01:25:24,032
Maybe later.

809
01:25:27,369 --> 01:25:29,329
We're not keeping him, are we?

810
01:26:45,614 --> 01:26:47,574
I'm just going to get some coffee.

811
01:26:47,991 --> 01:26:49,660
You want one?

812
01:26:50,035 --> 01:26:52,788
OK. I'll be back soon.

813
01:27:03,966 --> 01:27:05,926
Are you Michael?

814
01:27:07,261 --> 01:27:10,389
Your friend's very ill.
He has pneumonia.

815
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:15,102
His heart and lung muscles
are severely affected.

816
01:27:18,397 --> 01:27:20,649
Are you asking me if you can go in?

817
01:27:22,568 --> 01:27:25,821
He's very weak.
Better to let him rest this evening.

818
01:27:32,786 --> 01:27:34,788
I'm sorry, I can't understand you.

819
01:27:38,542 --> 01:27:40,127
How long?

820
01:27:42,629 --> 01:27:45,340
Probably not more than a day or two.

821
01:27:47,384 --> 01:27:50,012
It varies a little bit with Duchenne.

822
01:27:50,429 --> 01:27:52,848
But it's usually around his age.

823
01:27:56,059 --> 01:27:58,395
He'll have known that this was coming.

824
01:27:58,812 --> 01:28:01,857
He's not in any pain. He won't suffer.

825
01:28:40,521 --> 01:28:42,606
He wants to talk to you.

826
01:29:07,631 --> 01:29:09,591
There you are.

827
01:29:12,386 --> 01:29:15,055
I've been worried about you.

828
01:29:21,186 --> 01:29:23,522
Look at all this.

829
01:29:25,566 --> 01:29:27,442
You see.

830
01:29:28,861 --> 01:29:32,156
Rory... O'Shea...

831
01:29:33,115 --> 01:29:35,075
... was here.

832
01:29:37,327 --> 01:29:40,622
Rory O'Shea...

833
01:29:43,459 --> 01:29:47,880
is... here.

834
01:30:05,522 --> 01:30:07,483
Michael...

835
01:30:10,277 --> 01:30:11,612
You need...

836
01:30:13,363 --> 01:30:15,949
... nobody.

837
01:30:19,244 --> 01:30:21,205
You're...

838
01:30:21,663 --> 01:30:24,333
your own... man.

839
01:31:00,911 --> 01:31:03,288
Did you bring...

840
01:31:03,580 --> 01:31:05,707
... my stereo?

841
01:31:13,257 --> 01:31:15,217
I never...

842
01:31:15,509 --> 01:31:17,386
... liked you.

843
01:32:29,249 --> 01:32:30,918
Hi.

844
01:32:39,259 --> 01:32:43,680
We know about Rory's condition. We
appreciate you want to help your friend.

845
01:32:43,889 --> 01:32:45,849
Is now the right time for this?

846
01:32:47,893 --> 01:32:50,020
Why did you come here today?

847
01:32:56,151 --> 01:32:58,153
"I'm his lawyer. "

848
01:32:59,613 --> 01:33:02,282
Right, if you want to... erm...

849
01:33:02,533 --> 01:33:05,744
Rory's application for personal
assistance was turned down

850
01:33:05,994 --> 01:33:08,664
on the grounds of
insufficient responsibility.

851
01:33:08,914 --> 01:33:12,251
The grounds for appeal
are given as prejudice.

852
01:33:12,668 --> 01:33:17,756
Would you like to explain why Rory feels
the interviewing panel showed prejudice?

853
01:33:36,108 --> 01:33:38,068
"When I first met Rory...

854
01:33:40,445 --> 01:33:42,406
... I thought he was trouble. "

855
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:45,200
"And I was right. "

856
01:33:46,451 --> 01:33:47,744
"He is trouble. "

857
01:33:51,248 --> 01:33:53,375
"Yet because he's seen as a rebel...

858
01:33:56,753 --> 01:34:01,175
... you believe he hasn't the
responsibility to live independently. "

859
01:34:05,012 --> 01:34:07,222
"But how do you learn
to be responsible?"

860
01:34:10,809 --> 01:34:12,769
"You live in the world. "

861
01:34:16,940 --> 01:34:18,901
"You make your own decisions. "

862
01:34:20,569 --> 01:34:22,529
"You make your own mistakes. "

863
01:34:31,205 --> 01:34:35,167
"So if this panel can offer independent
living to someone like me...

864
01:34:39,004 --> 01:34:42,633
... who until recently
had no concept of what that meant...

865
01:34:54,436 --> 01:34:59,024
... and refuse someone who's very life
is an embodiment of independence...

866
01:35:05,864 --> 01:35:08,867
... then I believe
the panel showed a prejudice. "

867
01:35:13,997 --> 01:35:18,001
Michael, I think we're all aware
of Rory's prognosis.

868
01:35:19,878 --> 01:35:23,132
What was your purpose
in coming here today?

869
01:35:46,155 --> 01:35:49,533
"A right must exist
independently of its exercise. "

870
01:35:55,789 --> 01:36:00,836
OK. I think you can tell Rory
that in principle...

871
01:36:01,837 --> 01:36:05,632
... he can have the service
he's applied for.

872
01:36:09,928 --> 01:36:11,889
Thank you.

873
01:37:01,230 --> 01:37:04,191
Do not count his deeds
against him.

874
01:37:04,399 --> 01:37:08,403
For in his heart,
he desired to do your work.

875
01:37:08,695 --> 01:37:12,616
As his fate united him
to your people on Earth,

876
01:37:12,866 --> 01:37:16,870
so may your mercy
join him with the angels in heaven.

877
01:37:17,162 --> 01:37:20,916
- We ask this through Christ, our Lord.
- Amen.

878
01:37:21,166 --> 01:37:24,962
Eternal rest grant unto Rory, oh Lord.

879
01:37:27,589 --> 01:37:30,050
- May he rest in peace.
- Amen.

880
01:37:30,300 --> 01:37:34,596
May his soul, and the souls
of all the faithful departed,

881
01:37:34,847 --> 01:37:37,850
through the mercy of God, rest in peace.

882
01:38:13,218 --> 01:38:15,179
You all right?

883
01:38:17,014 --> 01:38:18,807
Can I do anything for you?

884
01:38:28,233 --> 01:38:30,194
Thank you.

885
01:38:37,618 --> 01:38:39,578
Thank you.

886
01:39:21,829 --> 01:39:23,789
Are we going out?

887
01:39:31,171 --> 01:39:33,132
OK.
