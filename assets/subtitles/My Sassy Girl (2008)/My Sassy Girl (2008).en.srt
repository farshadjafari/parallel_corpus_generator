1
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:30,249
<i>- This is the story</i>

2
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,252
<i>of the first and last time
I ever fell in love.</i>

3
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:36,422
<i>Let me start
with a little background</i>

4
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:38,257
<i>so that you can
understand exactly</i>

5
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:39,658
what I've been through here.

6
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,660
It's a boy!

7
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,163
<i>- My name is Charles Bellow,</i>

8
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,664
but you can call me Charlie.

9
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,001
<i>I was born
in French Lick, Indiana,</i>

10
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,502
which sounds like it could be

11
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,738
<i>kind of a cool,
scandalous place to be from,</i>

12
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:53,939
<i>but it's not.</i>

13
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,541
Uh, there's nothing French

14
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,409
<i>and trust me,
nothing is licked.</i>

15
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,211
My parents, Roger and Kitty,

16
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:02,181
<i>are the nicest people
you'd ever want to meet,</i>

17
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,950
<i>and I'm not just using
an expression there.</i>

18
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:07,386
<i>If you met people any nicer
than this,</i>

19
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:08,987
it would just upset you.

20
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,291
- Give the nice
lady a seat.

21
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,325
- OK!
- There you go.

22
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:15,361
<i>- I was taught to emulate
that niceness,</i>

23
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,696
<i>and to reasonably expect
it from other people.</i>

24
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,098
You can have my seat,
ma'am.

25
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,099
- Thank you, dear.

26
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,600
<i>- Now, that second part there,</i>

27
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:25,337
uh, that's where you can
get into a little trouble.

28
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:27,673
<i>When I was accepted at
Vanderweil University,</i>

29
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:28,941
<i>it was the fulfillment</i>

30
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,976
<i>of a dream my parents
had had since...</i>

31
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:34,113
- Oh! OK.

32
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:35,280
OK.

33
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:37,716
<i>- ... well, since
the very beginning.</i>

34
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,020
- All right.

35
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,024
<i>- A Bellow was going to college.</i>

36
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:47,059
<i>A Bellow was majoring
in business,</i>

37
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,529
so that a Bellow could then
go on to become a middle manager

38
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,531
<i>in a fine
American corporation...</i>

39
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:55,801
<i>Maybe even
the Tiller King Company,</i>

40
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:58,704
<i>whose tractors my father
repaired for a living.</i>

41
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,039
<i>I shared their dream.</i>

42
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,042
<i>I promised them
that I would not let them down,</i>

43
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:07,112
that the Bellow-family boulder
was about to get a serious shove

44
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:08,681
up the evolutionary hill.

45
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:12,685
Hi.

46
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,657
Hi.

47
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,559
They were counting on me.

48
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:26,465
Lord, how they were counting.

49
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:27,866
Hi.

50
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:31,670
Hi.

51
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:34,273
<i>Everything was on track
in my undergraduate years,</i>

52
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,109
<i>and I was lucky enough
to get into business school.</i>

53
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,477
And then I got word that

54
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:41,613
<i>my cousin Bart
had passed away... suddenly.</i>

55
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,884
- Death, man.

56
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,391
Death sucks.

57
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:57,496
- Glad you were a
philosophy major there, Leo.

58
00:04:57,497 --> 00:05:00,599
- Sorry. The death unit
was back in freshman year.

59
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,736
Meantime, we should probably
just try to cheer ourselves up

60
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:05,738
by sticking to
happier subjects...

61
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:07,106
like sex.

62
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:09,408
Wanna play the game, huh?

63
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:10,642
- Sure.

64
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,078
- Yes.

65
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:16,415
Yes.

66
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,017
Yes!

67
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:19,585
Yes.
- OK, OK, OK, OK.

68
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:21,353
Let's play this way.

69
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:25,290
Are there any women here
who you would not sleep with?

70
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,359
- Probably.

71
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,727
- Fair enough.

72
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:31,530
- Charlie, I'm a young male
at or near my sexual peak.

73
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:34,833
Don't hate me for following
my evolutionary blueprint.

74
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,036
- Oh, I do not.
- Hell, yes!

75
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:38,504
- I just, uh, I think it's-

76
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:41,273
I think it's suspect that
you could know in a second

77
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,609
whether or not you
would sleep with a woman.

78
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,945
For me- For me, those
decisions take a little thought.

79
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:50,716
- That's why you've only slept
with 3 women in 4 years!

80
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:52,351
- What, are you taking notes?

81
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,385
- Yes!

82
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:54,553
- Damn you!

83
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,989
I just have other priorities
right now, you know?

84
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,124
- I mean-
- Whoa! Careful, Charlie!

85
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:02,361
If the death of your cousin
teaches us anything,

86
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,329
it's that we must live!

87
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:08,233
Live, Charlie! Live!

88
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:09,968
- Live, you say.

89
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:10,969
- Yes!

90
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:11,970
- Yes.

91
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:14,340
- Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

92
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:16,075
Yes!

93
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:17,876
In your dreams, pervert!

94
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,979
- I mean, you might like it!
It might even be good for you.

95
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,114
- It might.

96
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,816
- I mean, do you
seriously claim

97
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:26,985
there is no woman within your
field of vision at this moment

98
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:29,355
with whom you would sleep,
no questions asked?

99
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,991
- Excuse me, but you should be!

100
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:34,860
- OK, I'm sorry.

101
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:35,861
- I...

102
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:40,065
I'm outta here.

103
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:43,268
- Just go.

104
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:44,903
- Wow, you open big!

105
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,140
- Yeah, go ahead.

106
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,209
- Course she's hammered...

107
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,811
or not particularly
coordinated,

108
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:55,080
but very hot.

109
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,217
Good call, Charlie.
Definite "yes".

110
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:01,086
- I'm not even saying that
I would sleep with her.

111
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,422
- Well, you're staring at her
pretty good.

112
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:07,059
- I would talk to her.
Uh, I would, uh...

113
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:11,063
- You would, uh...

114
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:12,731
- Uh, get to know her.
Um...

115
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:16,969
- OK!

116
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,571
- You know what? You live
your way, I'll live mine.

117
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,807
- Fine!

118
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:24,076
- Go begin
to get to know her then.

119
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:28,047
- Not today. I gotta pay
a condolence call to my aunt.

120
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:29,081
- Ugh.

121
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:30,849
- Let her pinch my cheek,

122
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,619
tell me how much
I look like my cousin.

123
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,290
Oh! Besides, she actually has
a girl she wants me to meet.

124
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,658
- You see, Charlie?

125
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:43,228
Everyone you know,
even your bereaved aunt,

126
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,597
is telling you
the same thing.

127
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:46,899
Live. Yes.

128
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,933
- Thank you.

129
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,702
# Whistle #

130
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:01,980
- Yes, I'm free
and I'm loving it!

131
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:09,521
Train, where are you?

132
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,490
Whoo-wee!

133
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,594
Choo-choo!
Choo-choo-choo!

134
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,268
Ah!

135
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:30,676
- Hey! Hey!

136
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,378
- Get off me!

137
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:35,614
<i>- Once in your life
if you are very lucky,</i>

138
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:38,684
<i>you will meet the person
who divides it...</i>

139
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,820
<i>into the time
before you met her</i>

140
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,689
<i>and the time after.</i>

141
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,992
<i>But she was, you know,
obviously big trouble,</i>

142
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:49,962
and-and I would've just
left it at that, except...

143
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:51,630
- Hey.

144
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:55,567
Hey! Give the gentleman
your seat!

145
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:56,769
Ha!

146
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,804
- Give me a break, all right?

147
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:06,111
- You're welcome.

148
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:09,314
You're welcome.

149
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,524
Darling.

150
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:30,536
Purse.

151
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:33,939
Purse!

152
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:15,681
- OK.

153
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:18,751
Not-not touching
you inappropriately.

154
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:21,286
OK, good.

155
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,921
I'm holding your waist.

156
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:25,257
Very specifically avoiding...

157
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:26,558
Yes.

158
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,127
Don't want a lawsuit.

159
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:30,262
OK.

160
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:32,264
Oh! Hey, yeah!

161
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:34,700
Hi! 5th and 11th.

162
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:36,101
- Is she dead?

163
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:37,970
- What? No!
She- No!

164
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,838
She's-
She's not, uh... she's OK.

165
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,006
- OK.

166
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:43,876
- It's my, uh, my sister.

167
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:46,245
She's... good.

168
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:54,887
Aw!

169
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:58,090
Very heavy girl!
Not fat, just muscular.

170
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:00,926
I would assume,
'cause you're dense, as in-

171
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:02,594
Not stupid,
I mean, heavy.

172
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:11,837
Hey!

173
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:15,641
Behind you, Einstein!

174
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:17,743
Open-open the window!

175
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:19,745
- What are you doing
on the fire escape?

176
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:21,146
- Just open the window, man!

177
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:23,549
- That's the girl from
before. You drugged her?

178
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,550
Are you crazy?
- No!

179
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:25,584
- Did anyone see you?

180
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:27,653
- Just the lobby guard
and the rickshaw guy.

181
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:29,788
- This is what happens
to the repressed ones.

182
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,157
One day they just snap!
Why'd you bring her here?

183
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:33,792
- She was passed out
in the subway!

184
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:36,362
- I said talk to her,
not knock her unconscious.

185
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,363
Just- here.

186
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:40,165
Head first. Head first.

187
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,166
- OK.

188
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,301
- Watch her head.

189
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:43,802
- Just give ma second.

190
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:45,170
- Come on!
- OK, OK.

191
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:46,872
- Oh, there you are.

192
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,173
- OK, she likes me.

193
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,677
Oh, she smells
like tequila.

194
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:54,646
- Let's keep her alive.

195
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:55,948
- OK!

196
00:11:57,751 --> 00:12:00,352
- This is a very limp girl.

197
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:01,754
- Oh boy!

198
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,323
Oh boy!

199
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:07,226
- Well, we're in trouble.

200
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,527
- Purse.

201
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:13,465
- So you brought her home?

202
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:16,969
- I couldn't very well leave
her on a subway bench, right?

203
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:20,072
- Which makes this,
technically, kidnapping.

204
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,309
- Eventually, she will wake up,

205
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,646
she will take the walk
of shame out of here

206
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:29,281
and that'll be that.

207
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:35,054
- So, did you
talk to her?

208
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:37,890
- Not really.

209
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:40,092
- What's she like?
Is she nice?

210
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:43,729
- I'm not sure, but...

211
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,197
I don't think so.

212
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,470
- Security.
Open the door!

213
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:55,174
- We aren't even in real jail.
We're in university jail.

214
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:56,175
- I know.

215
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:57,676
This is so humiliating!

216
00:12:57,677 --> 00:12:58,677
- Hey, Bellow!

217
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:00,646
Oh, I'm gonna be watching you!

218
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:02,281
You're on my radar!

219
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,582
- OK, um, I-I understand

220
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:06,418
and I thank you f-for
following due process on this-

221
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:07,419
- Go, Charlie!

222
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,555
- I respect what
you're doing. Thank you!

223
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:10,556
- Watch it, Bellow!

224
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:12,691
- Hello.

225
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:14,059
<i>- Who are you?</i>

226
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,094
- Uh, who are you?

227
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:17,463
- Who are you?

228
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:19,598
- I'm the girl you abducted
this afternoon.

229
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:22,901
- Oh! Um, how did you
get this number?

230
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:26,271
- Oh, security was only
too happy.

231
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,273
I have all your information!

232
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:29,975
- Why are you
asking me who I am?

233
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,443
<i>- I'm not asking who you are.</i>

234
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:33,412
I'm asking
who you think you are.

235
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:35,247
- You know what?
I don't have time-

236
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:38,317
- Meet me at the Spike Gallery,
6th and 4th.

237
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,618
<i>- Um, no.</i>

238
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:41,120
- Why not?

239
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:43,422
- Because the
Tiller King representative

240
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:45,190
is coming to campus this week.

241
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,925
- Yeah, be there at 7:13.

242
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:52,464
- Definitely not nice.

243
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:14,186
- Charles Bellow.

244
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,155
- Charlie.

245
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:17,356
- Hmm.

246
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,324
I'll take a red.

247
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:20,592
- Ah!

248
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:23,095
- Red for the lady.
And for you, sir?

249
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:25,297
- Um, I-

250
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:28,334
I think the-
I think the white.

251
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:30,035
So red, yeah.

252
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,036
- OK then.

253
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,037
- So what happened?

254
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,038
- Well, you, uh-

255
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,039
- I can't hear you.

256
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,441
- You were completely drunk.

257
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:37,242
You almost fell
on the subway track.

258
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,178
I pulled you back
at the last instant.

259
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:41,380
You called me darling,
then you passed out.

260
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:42,781
I assumed responsibility.

261
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:44,516
I carried you back to my place

262
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:47,886
and somebody called security
on us- on me- on- for you.

263
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,188
- I called you darling?

264
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,423
- Yeah.

265
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:53,625
- I think I remember that.

266
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:00,499
But I seriously
doubt the rest of it.

267
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:06,605
Jordan Roark.

268
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:07,606
- Rork.

269
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:09,575
- Roark.
R- O-A-R-K, Roark.

270
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:10,576
- OK.

271
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:13,012
- What are you studying?

272
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:14,079
- Uh, business.

273
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,080
- Are you smart?

274
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:18,217
- Uh, maybe a little.
I don't know.

275
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:22,287
- Well, most smart
people are smart enough

276
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:25,257
not to have
to study business.

277
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:28,227
Thank you...

278
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:31,363
for not leaving me on
the subway bench, Charles.

279
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:32,498
- You're welcome.

280
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:34,600
Um, and it's-
it's Charlie, please.

281
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,636
Uh, am I allowed to ask you

282
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:41,774
why you were dead drunk in
the middle of the afternoon?

283
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:45,077
- Goin' through
a reckless phase.

284
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:46,879
- And wh- by that,
you mean...

285
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,247
- Don't know what it means?

286
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:49,314
- No, I-

287
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,150
- Guess you're
really not smart!

288
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:53,085
- I know what the word means,

289
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:55,754
I'm-I'm asking you
what-what you mean.

290
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:57,489
- What do you care, Chuck?

291
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:01,226
- Charlie!
And um, I'm interested.

292
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:03,796
- Chuck. Chuck. Chuck.
Chuck, Chuck, Chuck, Chuck.

293
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:07,066
Chuck! Chuck!

294
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:08,067
- OK, um...

295
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:10,502
I'm gonna go, Jordan.

296
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:13,505
Uh, I hope that you get
through your reckless phase

297
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:15,674
and that you have
a relatively happy

298
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:18,444
and disaster-free
rest of your life.

299
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:20,179
Um, goodbye.

300
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:23,415
- My fiancée broke up with me.

301
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:32,157
Uh... Uh, it's OK.

302
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,292
Here.

303
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:35,361
- You carry an handkerchief?

304
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:37,096
What are you, an asthmatic?

305
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:40,032
- No, I- Where I'm from,
people carry handkerchiefs.

306
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:42,501
- Where are you from? 1850?

307
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,169
Is it clean?

308
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,270
- Yes.

309
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:48,340
- Fine.

310
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:53,045
Here.

311
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:55,147
- No, you-you can keep that.

312
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:56,682
- No, you take it.

313
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,083
- OK, I'll, uh...

314
00:16:58,084 --> 00:16:59,385
Uh...

315
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:01,754
- ... we can get them
away for a while.

316
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:03,088
- You want some?

317
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:05,024
- Yeah, thank you.
I, uh, OK.

318
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:06,492
Why did he, uh, why-

319
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,328
Why did he break up with you?

320
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:12,097
- Well...

321
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:15,768
I like bananas.

322
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:17,302
- You-

323
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,640
OK, um...

324
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:24,910
It's OK.
It's, uh... It's OK.

325
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:26,612
Uh...

326
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,321
Hi, um, uh, Manhattan.
Jordan Roark.

327
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:37,556
- Huh?

328
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,391
- No, no.
Just sleep. It's-

329
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,659
Uh, hi.
No, not you.

330
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,028
Uh, Jor-
R- O-A-R-K.

331
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:44,697
- Roark.

332
00:17:44,698 --> 00:17:46,465
- That many?

333
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:49,201
OK, let's,
uh, start downtown.

334
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:51,203
- # Downtown... #

335
00:17:54,341 --> 00:17:56,375
No, not here.

336
00:18:00,814 --> 00:18:02,514
- No, man.
We don't know any Roarks.

337
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:04,416
- Bye now.
Have a nice night.

338
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,785
<i># Anyone #</i>

339
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:10,856
<i># Anyone #</i>

340
00:18:13,193 --> 00:18:14,827
<i># Anyone #</i>

341
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:16,228
- Hi. Good evening, sir.

342
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:17,496
- Good evening.

343
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:18,697
Um, do you know her?

344
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:19,698
- Yes, sir.

345
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:21,834
Were there any
other expenses, sir?

346
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:24,937
- Can I just get you to
tell me her name in case-

347
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,038
Just to make sure.

348
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:27,673
- Her name is
Jordan Roark, sir.

349
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:28,674
- Roark.

350
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:30,642
- Were there any
other expenses?

351
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:31,844
- Uh, no. No.

352
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:35,547
- Keep it.

353
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:38,117
The Roarks thank you
very much, sir.

354
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:39,618
- Yeah.

355
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,388
- Sir.

356
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:45,224
- Hi, Jimmy.
How was your day?

357
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:48,827
- Ah, you know, the usual.
Held some doors, said hello.

358
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:50,095
- Is she gonna be OK?

359
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:51,196
- Yes, sir.

360
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:54,667
- Can you give her
some aspirin, some water?

361
00:18:54,668 --> 00:18:56,368
Yes, sir.

362
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:57,870
- Thank you.

363
00:18:57,871 --> 00:18:59,872
- Uh, anytime there, Spanky!

364
00:18:59,873 --> 00:19:03,575
- Ah, yeah.
5th and 11th.

365
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,513
Whoa!

366
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:09,982
- We now have dealerships
in all 50 states,

367
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:13,152
including Alaska and Hawaii.

368
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:15,120
Now, of course,
we made our reputation

369
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:17,122
on big, heavy farm machinery,

370
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:19,324
but we also
have a line of mowers

371
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:20,926
that is second to none.

372
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:22,261
What?

373
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:24,463
- Oh please,
oh please, oh please...

374
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:42,448
- Is there a Charles Bellow
in this room?

375
00:19:42,449 --> 00:19:44,116
Damn it!

376
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:48,554
- Yes, sir.

377
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:49,855
- Mr. Bellow,

378
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:53,058
I believe you'd better go
with this young lady.

379
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:56,095
- I-I don't-
I don't...

380
00:19:56,096 --> 00:19:58,063
I don't think
that'll be necessary.

381
00:19:58,064 --> 00:19:59,398
- Oh, Mr. Bellow,

382
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:02,468
I believe you had better go
with this young lady.

383
00:20:02,469 --> 00:20:05,170
Now, if there is anything
we prize

384
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:07,006
at the Tiller King Company,

385
00:20:07,007 --> 00:20:08,841
is a man with the strength

386
00:20:08,842 --> 00:20:11,543
to take responsibility
for his own actions.

387
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:14,847
- Yes, sir.

388
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,149
- Now...

389
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:24,189
- Hi!

390
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,190
- Hi. What-what-

391
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:26,358
What are you doing here?

392
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:27,359
- Come play with me!

393
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,360
- What?

394
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:30,462
- Come play with me.
It's a beautiful day.

395
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:32,965
- No, I- First of all,
I was in the middle of a-

396
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:34,400
- No, I-I took care of that.

397
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:36,235
- Yeah, whoa!
What did that note say?

398
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:37,302
- Nothing.

399
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:39,171
- No, what did the note say?

400
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:42,207
- It said that I just found out

401
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,410
that I'm pregnant
with your child.

402
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:47,046
- No, don't scream,

403
00:20:47,047 --> 00:20:49,214
'because it's gonna
make it worse.

404
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:51,316
- Why- You don't-
You- You-

405
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:54,453
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

406
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:55,454
That's-that's-

407
00:20:55,455 --> 00:20:57,790
that's the Tiller King
representative in there.

408
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,158
That's my future in there!

409
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:00,192
- Really?

410
00:21:00,193 --> 00:21:01,527
- Yes!

411
00:21:01,528 --> 00:21:02,528
- How sad!

412
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:05,497
- I can't believe that you-

413
00:21:08,201 --> 00:21:09,702
- Well, fine!

414
00:21:09,703 --> 00:21:11,337
But as practical matter, Chuck,

415
00:21:11,338 --> 00:21:13,405
you really can't go
back in there now.

416
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:16,241
So you might as well

417
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:18,944

the day with me!

generally begins,</i>

424
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:38,497

425
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:40,866
<i>and the destruction of
a lifelong dream.</i>

426
00:21:40,867 --> 00:21:42,001
OK.

427
00:21:42,002 --> 00:21:43,002
- It's OK!

428

Faster!

429
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:47,006

00:21:47,007 --> 00:21:48,574
- Faster!

431
00:21:49,843 --> 00:21:51,143

00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:53,312

I like that!

be nicer to each other.

510
00:25:04,938 --> 00:25:06,705
- It's not a love story.

511
00:25:06,706 --> 00:25:10,209
Charlie, it's a story about how
men can't handle big trouble.

- Um, well, I think
people are still gonna want

514
00:25:14,814 --> 00:25:17,916

And, uh, don't go
to sleep tonight.

540
00:26:09,969 --> 00:26:11,136
- Really?

541
00:26:11,137 --> 00:26:13,539
- Yeah, you have
a level one concussion.

542
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,707
Just in case.

543
00:26:14,708 --> 00:26:16,675
- OK.

544
00:26:16,676 --> 00:26:18,544
- And I think it would be best

545
00:26:18,545 --> 00:26:20,779
if you didn't
see my daughter again.

546
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:25,217
- Um, you speaking as my doctor
or as her father?

547
00:26:26,953 --> 00:26:29,688
- Jordan tells me
that you're the young man

548
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:31,590
that brought her
home the other night.

549
00:26:31,591 --> 00:26:32,958
- I am.

550
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:36,061
- It seems to me that
whenever you two get together,

551
00:26:36,062 --> 00:26:38,764
someone becomes separated
from his senses.

552
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:47,306
You're obviously
a bad influence on her.

553
00:26:47,307 --> 00:26:49,742
- I'm a bad influence on her?

554
00:26:49,743 --> 00:26:51,844
- Would you disagree?

555
00:26:53,346 --> 00:26:56,448
- No, sir, I would not.
Thank you.

556
00:26:59,419 --> 00:27:00,853
- I'm sorry about him.

557
00:27:00,854 --> 00:27:02,955
You know, ever since
the fiancée,

558
00:27:02,956 --> 00:27:05,557
he's been really
overprotective and-

559
00:27:05,558 --> 00:27:07,226
- Yeah, no, he's your dad.

560
00:27:07,227 --> 00:27:09,628
Um, you know,
he's just lookin' out for you.

561
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:18,137
- Goodbye.

562
00:27:19,239 --> 00:27:20,939
- Goodbye.

563
00:27:21,941 --> 00:27:24,076
- Um...

564
00:27:25,845 --> 00:27:27,613
Take care of your head.

565
00:27:29,249 --> 00:27:31,116
- Yeah, you too.

566
00:27:59,846 --> 00:28:01,680
- You're intrigued by this girl?

567
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:04,717
- No, no, I'm not.

568
00:28:04,718 --> 00:28:07,653
Who would be
intrigued by a hot,

569
00:28:07,654 --> 00:28:11,123
mysterious, passionate,

570
00:28:11,124 --> 00:28:14,259
possibly bi-polar, violent,

571
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,428
drunken, arrogant, rude...

572
00:28:16,429 --> 00:28:18,030
woman?

573
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:19,698
- There are people.

574
00:28:20,967 --> 00:28:22,434
- Don't go to sleep, man!
- Aw!

575
00:28:22,435 --> 00:28:26,271
- Don't sleep! The doctor
said I gotta stay up.

576
00:28:26,272 --> 00:28:29,174
- So don't go to sleep!
Leave me alone!

a subway platform

588
00:29:09,249 --> 00:29:11,417
- Mom!
- Um, he's like 5, Jordan.

589
00:29:11,418 --> 00:29:12,618
- What did I do wrong?

590
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:14,720
- Some people are bad, Tommy.
- Well-

591
00:29:14,721 --> 00:29:16,155
- Like Uncle Herb in jail?

592
00:29:16,156 --> 00:29:17,389
- Hey, here's the game.

593
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:20,492
When someone crosses that
red line with their left foot,

594
00:29:20,493 --> 00:29:21,493
I win.

595
00:29:21,494 --> 00:29:22,628
Right foot, you win.

596
00:29:22,629 --> 00:29:24,530
- OK, what do we win?

597
00:29:24,531 --> 00:29:27,132
- I don't know
What do you suggest?

598
00:29:28,134 --> 00:29:29,635
- A kiss?

599
00:29:29,636 --> 00:29:31,804
- A kiss.
A kiss, everybody!

600
00:29:31,805 --> 00:29:33,639
Can you believe it?
He wants a kiss!

601
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,941
- OK, OK!
You decide what then.

602
00:29:35,942 --> 00:29:39,712
- I was thinking,
like, a slap.

603
00:29:39,713 --> 00:29:41,714
- Like you need
a game for that?

604
00:29:41,715 --> 00:29:43,949
- Well, you can slap me too!
- I don't want-

605
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,084
Why would I want-

606
00:29:45,085 --> 00:29:47,052
- Just- Shh!

00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,101
- I-I'd call it not wanting-

You didn't see what foot-

00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,738
- Yes, I did.

612

- You were looking at me!
- Was not!

613
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,208
- He came from
the other direction!

614
00:30:09,209 --> 00:30:10,743
- We never specified direction!

- Are you part of it? Because-

- I'm not happy about it either.

667

- But I asked for one thing.

00:33:38,651 --> 00:33:41,453
- When have you not had a good
time at an amusement park,

675
00:33:41,454 --> 00:33:42,554
besides this time?

676
00:33:42,555 --> 00:33:45,024
- Shut up!
What is your relationship?

677
00:33:45,025 --> 00:33:46,425
- We're just friends, sir.

678
00:33:46,426 --> 00:33:48,227
- Bullshit!

679
00:33:48,228 --> 00:33:50,362
One look at you two,
I know that's not true.

680
00:33:50,363 --> 00:33:53,165
- Give me my jacket.
Where's my manual?

681
00:33:53,166 --> 00:33:54,700
- I had a girlfriend too.

682
00:33:54,701 --> 00:33:56,669
- Oh, I'm not his girlfriend.

683
00:33:57,671 --> 00:33:59,171
- For a year and a half.

684
00:33:59,172 --> 00:34:03,142
But then, when I enlisted,
she left me for this Frenchman!

685
00:34:03,143 --> 00:34:05,310
Can you believe it?
A Frenchman!

686
00:34:05,311 --> 00:34:07,179
We had a dog!

687
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,882
Yorkshire terrier.
Rufus.

688
00:34:09,883 --> 00:34:11,583
But you know what?
Fuck Rufus!

689
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:14,086
'Cause he too
now seems to love the Frenchman!

690
00:34:14,087 --> 00:34:15,087
- Uh, who do I-

691
00:34:15,088 --> 00:34:16,355
- I gotta have my manual.

692
00:34:16,356 --> 00:34:17,389
- Hello? Hello?

693
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:18,590
- Where's my manual?

694
00:34:18,591 --> 00:34:20,492
- So tonight, at lights out,

695
00:34:20,493 --> 00:34:21,694
grabbed my weapon,

696
00:34:21,695 --> 00:34:23,829
and I came to kill them,
Rufus included.

697
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:25,864
But they weren't home.

698
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,567
I have the worse luck.

699
00:34:29,602 --> 00:34:31,403
- I'm sorry.

700
00:34:32,906 --> 00:34:36,642
Had we known, we would've
gone to Six Flags.

701
00:34:38,578 --> 00:34:41,046
- I'm on hold.
- I got it! I found the manual.

702
00:34:41,047 --> 00:34:44,216
- I change my mind.
I'm not gonna kill them.

703
00:34:44,217 --> 00:34:46,418
- I'm gonna kill myself.

704
00:34:46,419 --> 00:34:48,487
- Uh, well, that's
sad to hear, but if-

705
00:34:48,488 --> 00:34:51,557
- You know, I heard when you
fire a bullet into your head,

706
00:34:51,558 --> 00:34:52,958
your entire skull explodes.

707
00:34:52,959 --> 00:34:54,560
You know, as opposed to this

708
00:34:54,561 --> 00:34:57,396
sort of little, red bullet-hole
thing you see in the movies.

709
00:34:57,397 --> 00:34:59,264
- What's the difference?
You're dead!

710
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:00,466
- Why kill yourself?

711
00:35:00,467 --> 00:35:02,434
It's not gonna make her
come back to you.

712
00:35:02,435 --> 00:35:04,770
- But it'll put me
out of my misery.

713
00:35:04,771 --> 00:35:05,804
And it'll hurt her.

714
00:35:05,805 --> 00:35:07,673
She'll never be the same.

715
00:35:07,674 --> 00:35:10,709
- You're wrong, 'cause time
will pass, and she'll be fine.

716
00:35:12,112 --> 00:35:13,912
- How do you know?

717
00:35:13,913 --> 00:35:16,482
- Because that's
the way it works.

718
00:35:16,483 --> 00:35:18,250
- How do you know?

719
00:35:19,285 --> 00:35:20,853
- It has to be.

720
00:35:22,889 --> 00:35:24,490
- So then I'm screwed.

721
00:35:24,491 --> 00:35:27,326
If I kill myself, it
accomplishes nothing,

722
00:35:27,327 --> 00:35:28,527
plus I'm dead.

723
00:35:28,528 --> 00:35:30,896
If I don't, I get court-
martialled for desertion.

724
00:35:30,897 --> 00:35:33,565
- Of the two, I would go with
the court martial though.

725
00:35:33,566 --> 00:35:35,401
Good luck!
- You know what?

726
00:35:35,402 --> 00:35:38,003
Your eyebrows remind me
of the Frenchman's

727
00:35:38,004 --> 00:35:39,238
- Take me. Let her go.

728
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:40,239
- What?

729
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,707
- Jordan, it's been very nice

730
00:35:41,708 --> 00:35:43,175
getting to know you a little.

731
00:35:43,176 --> 00:35:44,943
Um, happy birthday.
- No.

732
00:35:44,944 --> 00:35:46,979
- This is between you and me.
Let her go.

733
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,180
- Drop your weapon!

734
00:35:48,181 --> 00:35:50,015
- I will not!
You drop your weapons!

735
00:35:50,016 --> 00:35:52,484
- No, you drop your weapon!
- You drop your weapons!

736
00:35:52,485 --> 00:35:54,820
- Wait!
- You drop your weapon!

737
00:35:54,821 --> 00:35:57,523
- You can't make me!
- Yes, I can!

738
00:35:57,524 --> 00:35:59,258
- You drop your weapon!
- No, you!

739
00:35:59,259 --> 00:36:01,593
- Just wait a second!
Just please, wait!

740
00:36:01,594 --> 00:36:03,162
- No, you!
- Wait a minute!

741
00:36:03,163 --> 00:36:04,496
Listen to me!

742
00:36:04,497 --> 00:36:07,266
You're girlfriend, she
broke your heart, didn't she?

743
00:36:07,267 --> 00:36:09,268
- Yes!
- She left you.

744
00:36:09,269 --> 00:36:11,136
She broke her promise
and betrayed you.

745
00:36:11,137 --> 00:36:12,371
- Yes!
Yes, she did.

746
00:36:12,372 --> 00:36:13,939
- Some of us are
meant to suffer!

747
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,374
Some of us are
led to believe

748
00:36:15,375 --> 00:36:17,076
that we have
this certain destiny,

749
00:36:17,077 --> 00:36:18,811
and then it just
gets snatched away.

750
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,114
But we have to stay alive.

751
00:36:23,817 --> 00:36:26,051
Because we have to see...

752
00:36:27,487 --> 00:36:29,722
how the story ends.

753
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,927
Right?

754
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:40,833
Please.

755
00:36:48,308 --> 00:36:50,075
- Hey!

756
00:36:50,076 --> 00:36:52,378
If you're smart
you'll stay with her!

757
00:36:52,379 --> 00:36:55,314
She's a great girlfriend!
I can tell.

758
00:36:55,315 --> 00:36:57,149
Suspect is down!

759
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,751
I say again:
suspect is down!

760
00:37:01,321 --> 00:37:03,589
- We're just friends.

761
00:37:05,158 --> 00:37:07,393
So that's what you think?

762
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:09,995
- Not exactly, um,
I- I-I hadn't-

763
00:37:09,996 --> 00:37:11,797
I- I don't know what category.

764
00:37:11,798 --> 00:37:12,998
- Listen!

765
00:37:12,999 --> 00:37:14,900
We're seeing each other.

766
00:37:14,901 --> 00:37:17,202
- We are?
- Of course.

767
00:37:17,203 --> 00:37:18,871
- OK!

768
00:37:18,872 --> 00:37:21,373
<i>Her birthday was
an unmitigated disaster,</i>

769
00:37:21,374 --> 00:37:23,275
but all things considered...

770
00:37:23,276 --> 00:37:24,677
- Come on!

771
00:37:24,678 --> 00:37:26,578
<i>- ... I felt pretty good,</i>

772
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:28,647
<i>because I had seen
the depth of her soul,</i>

773
00:37:28,648 --> 00:37:30,716
<i>and I found out
we were seeing each other.</i>

774
00:37:31,718 --> 00:37:32,885
- Gotcha!

775
00:37:36,623 --> 00:37:38,590
- Hey! Let's do this.

776
00:37:38,591 --> 00:37:40,392
- Oh, yeah!

777
00:37:40,393 --> 00:37:41,727
- Oh!

778
00:37:41,728 --> 00:37:43,595
- Aah!
- Whoops!

779
00:37:43,596 --> 00:37:45,698
Oh! Wait!

780
00:37:53,139 --> 00:37:56,175
# Pachelbel's Canon #

781
00:38:01,514 --> 00:38:04,049
- Ow! Ow! Ow!

782
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:06,618
<i>Some days with her were...
painful.</i>

783
00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:09,121
OK, Rork wins
- Roark!

784
00:38:09,122 --> 00:38:11,523
- So, are there
any questions about...

785
00:38:11,524 --> 00:38:13,992
<i>- But hours without her
were even worse.</i>

786
00:38:21,801 --> 00:38:24,036
Hi. Waiting.

787
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:32,344
- You look just like him.

788
00:38:32,345 --> 00:38:34,246
- Uh, I've been told.

789
00:38:34,247 --> 00:38:35,481
- You're his brother?

790
00:38:35,482 --> 00:38:37,683
- Cousin.
- Ah!

791
00:38:37,684 --> 00:38:39,318
I miss him and your aunt.

792
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:42,087
They came in here
every Sunday for years,

793
00:38:42,088 --> 00:38:44,356
always took
the same table.

794
00:38:44,357 --> 00:38:46,325
She's hardly
been back since.

795
00:38:46,326 --> 00:38:47,726
- Um-

796
00:38:47,727 --> 00:38:49,294
- You miss me?
- Yeah.

797
00:38:49,295 --> 00:38:50,562
- Great. Thank you!

798
00:38:50,563 --> 00:38:52,231
- Certainly.

799
00:38:52,232 --> 00:38:54,767
<i>- I have a present for you.</i>

800
00:38:54,768 --> 00:38:56,568
- Do you?

801
00:38:58,204 --> 00:38:59,972
- Ta-da!

802
00:39:01,608 --> 00:39:03,308
- Oh, good!

803
00:39:03,309 --> 00:39:05,544
- What?
You don't wanna read it?

804
00:39:05,545 --> 00:39:08,547
- No, I-I-
I most certainly do.

805
00:39:09,883 --> 00:39:11,717
Thank you.

806
00:39:11,718 --> 00:39:13,485
Bounty hunter.

807
00:39:13,486 --> 00:39:17,289
<i>- It's a Western!
And the outlaw's name is Chuck!</i>

808
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:19,458
<i>- The heroine was</i>

809
00:39:19,459 --> 00:39:21,293
a mysterious bounty hunter,

810
00:39:21,294 --> 00:39:24,363
<i>who arrived one day
from parts unknown.</i>

811
00:39:24,364 --> 00:39:26,198
- The Bounty Hunter!
It's good title!

812
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:27,766
- It's a great title!
- Read it.

813
00:39:27,767 --> 00:39:29,702
- I'm not good at
reading and talking.

814
00:39:29,703 --> 00:39:31,337
- Read it!
- OK, I'm reading it.

815
00:39:34,007 --> 00:39:36,542
- Are you reading it?
- I am, uh, reading it.

816
00:39:38,578 --> 00:39:40,045
- Just picture it, OK?

817
00:39:40,046 --> 00:39:42,014
Come on! Come on! Come on!

818
00:39:43,249 --> 00:39:44,383
Do-do-do! Do-do-do!

819
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,951
Oh, how you'll like it!

820
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:49,555
<i>- She kills him.
What a shock!</i>

821
00:39:49,556 --> 00:39:52,491
<i>Only then does she reveal
where she came from...</i>

822
00:39:52,492 --> 00:39:54,259
<i>The future.</i>

823
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,595
- Isn't it great?

824
00:39:56,596 --> 00:39:59,898
- Ooh! It's, uh...
It is...

825
00:39:59,899 --> 00:40:01,533
It's is...

826
00:40:01,534 --> 00:40:03,802
Uh... question.

827
00:40:03,803 --> 00:40:08,507
Why, uh, why does the heroine
always come from the future?

828
00:40:08,508 --> 00:40:10,609
- Because I believe
in time travel.

829
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:13,679
I believe that in the future
it's already been invented,

830
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,116
and that there are people from
the future with us as we speak.

831
00:40:17,117 --> 00:40:19,251
And I think that one day,

832
00:40:19,252 --> 00:40:22,187
I will eventually meet
someone from the future.

833
00:40:25,592 --> 00:40:27,760
- I'm sure you will then.

834
00:40:27,761 --> 00:40:29,795
- I have another
present for you.

835
00:40:29,796 --> 00:40:31,830
- OK.

836
00:40:31,831 --> 00:40:33,532
What is that?

837
00:40:33,533 --> 00:40:36,301
- You've been granted an
interview with the vampire.

838
00:40:36,302 --> 00:40:39,505
A regional sales manager
named Mr. Phipps,

839
00:40:39,506 --> 00:40:43,409
who will be selecting
Tiller King management trainees.

840
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:45,577
Drinks tomorrow.
His hotel.

841
00:40:45,578 --> 00:40:47,980
- OK, that is great news.

842
00:40:47,981 --> 00:40:49,882
Um, where did you get this?

843
00:40:49,883 --> 00:40:51,350
- Your mailbox.

844
00:40:51,351 --> 00:40:53,385
- You went through my mail?

845
00:40:53,386 --> 00:40:55,721
Why would you go-
That's illegal! You're not-

846
00:40:55,722 --> 00:40:58,724
- Are we gonna argue about that?
- Yes!

847
00:40:58,725 --> 00:41:01,160
- Or are you gonna have
a great dinner tonight,

848
00:41:01,161 --> 00:41:03,662
wake up tomorrow and have
an amazing interview

849
00:41:03,663 --> 00:41:06,065
and call me the second
that it's done.

850
00:41:11,671 --> 00:41:13,572
<i>- What a city, huh, Charlie?</i>

851
00:41:13,573 --> 00:41:17,109
- Yes, sir!
Yes, sir, Mr. Phipps.

852
00:41:23,183 --> 00:41:24,883
- You know,
I can never remember.

853
00:41:24,884 --> 00:41:26,785
Is the Bronx up
or the Battery down

854
00:41:26,786 --> 00:41:28,654
or the Battery up
and the Bronx down?

855
00:41:28,655 --> 00:41:29,688
- First one, I think.

856
00:41:29,689 --> 00:41:31,690
- Right! Right!

857
00:41:31,691 --> 00:41:32,791
Sure!

858
00:41:32,792 --> 00:41:34,393
- Drinks, gentlemen?

859
00:41:34,394 --> 00:41:35,928
- Diet Pepsi, please.

860
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:39,098
- And for you?

861
00:41:40,433 --> 00:41:42,434
- 2 Diet Pepsis, comin' up!

862
00:41:43,937 --> 00:41:45,070
- So, Charlie!

863
00:41:45,071 --> 00:41:48,107
Your dad works at the
maintenance facility

864
00:41:48,108 --> 00:41:49,641
in French Lick?

865
00:41:49,642 --> 00:41:52,311
- Uh, 27 years, sir, yes.

866
00:41:52,312 --> 00:41:53,912
- Looked him up.

867
00:41:53,913 --> 00:41:56,582
He is a model employee.

868
00:41:56,583 --> 00:41:57,816
I mean, you only wish

869
00:41:57,817 --> 00:42:01,687
every employee was cut
from the same cloth!

870
00:42:01,688 --> 00:42:06,392
if you're a chip off
that block, let me tell you,

871
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:10,362
I think your chances
are pretty good indeed.

872
00:42:10,363 --> 00:42:11,530
- Uh, that is-

873
00:42:11,531 --> 00:42:13,165
- All right!

874
00:42:13,166 --> 00:42:15,901
- Diet Pepsi for you.

875
00:42:15,902 --> 00:42:17,970
Diet Pepsi for you!

876
00:42:17,971 --> 00:42:19,405
Oops!

877
00:42:19,406 --> 00:42:21,273
And a double tequila for me!

878
00:42:21,274 --> 00:42:22,741
Charlie, push over.

879
00:42:22,742 --> 00:42:24,643
- You two know each other?

880
00:42:24,644 --> 00:42:27,946
- Uh, this, uh,
this is Mr. Phipps.

881
00:42:27,947 --> 00:42:30,449
This is Jordan Roark.
We are- She-

882
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:32,084
We're-
we're seeing each other.

883
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,054
- Well!

884
00:42:35,055 --> 00:42:36,188
- Oh!

885
00:42:36,189 --> 00:42:38,290
- It's a pleasure to
meet you, Miss Roark.

886
00:42:38,291 --> 00:42:40,759
- Oh, well the pleasure
is all mine, Mr. Phipps.

887
00:42:42,028 --> 00:42:43,762
- To the Tiller King Company!

888
00:42:43,763 --> 00:42:45,164
- Yes, indeed!

889
00:42:45,165 --> 00:42:46,765
- Oh boy!

890
00:42:48,368 --> 00:42:50,402
- Oh!

891
00:42:50,403 --> 00:42:51,670
Oh.

892
00:42:51,671 --> 00:42:53,572
Dmitri!
Can I get another one?

893
00:42:53,573 --> 00:42:54,573
- Right away!

894
00:42:54,574 --> 00:42:57,242
- Oh, I'm sorry,
did you- anything else?

895
00:42:57,243 --> 00:42:58,844
- No, no, no.
We're good.

896
00:42:58,845 --> 00:42:59,912
- Uh, Mr. Phipps-

897
00:42:59,913 --> 00:43:01,780
- How did you two
meet each other?

898
00:43:01,781 --> 00:43:03,282
- Uh-

899
00:43:03,283 --> 00:43:05,851
- Well, it depends
on who you believe.

900
00:43:05,852 --> 00:43:09,722
Either I got drunk and passed
out in the subway platform,

901
00:43:09,723 --> 00:43:11,090
or he drugged me.

902
00:43:12,992 --> 00:43:14,226
- She's so silly!

903
00:43:14,227 --> 00:43:15,794
- I see!

904
00:43:15,795 --> 00:43:17,096
- Tequila? Double?

905
00:43:17,097 --> 00:43:18,731
- Yes, thank you!

906
00:43:20,367 --> 00:43:22,968
To the Tiller King
Company! Whoo!

907
00:43:22,969 --> 00:43:24,136
- Righty-o!

908
00:43:24,137 --> 00:43:25,304
- Cheers!

909
00:43:25,305 --> 00:43:26,739
- Righty-o!

910
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:28,907
- Um, as I was, uh...

911
00:43:28,908 --> 00:43:30,342
- Ah!

912
00:43:30,343 --> 00:43:32,678
- ... saying about
the annual report, uh...

913
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:34,546
- Dmitri! Another!

914
00:43:34,547 --> 00:43:35,581
- Got it!

915
00:43:35,582 --> 00:43:37,683
- Oh, there I go again.
Anyone else?

916
00:43:37,684 --> 00:43:39,318
- No.
- No, thank you.

917
00:43:39,319 --> 00:43:40,352
- Oh boy!

918
00:43:40,353 --> 00:43:41,487
- Um, I, uh-

919
00:43:41,488 --> 00:43:43,322
- How long have
you two been together?

920
00:43:43,323 --> 00:43:44,456
- Oh, not very long.

921
00:43:44,457 --> 00:43:46,692
We're still in
the beginning phases.

922
00:43:46,693 --> 00:43:48,427
I haven't seen his penis yet.

923
00:43:51,264 --> 00:43:52,698
- There you are!

924
00:43:52,699 --> 00:43:54,466
- Ha ha!
Tequila double.

925
00:43:54,467 --> 00:43:56,235
Thank you!

926
00:43:56,236 --> 00:43:58,637
Hey! Do not lose that bottle!

927
00:43:58,638 --> 00:44:00,239
- I won't!

928
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,508
- To the King Killerton...

929
00:44:02,509 --> 00:44:04,343
Tiller King,
King Tiller. Whatever!

930
00:44:04,344 --> 00:44:05,911
Cheers.

931
00:44:08,581 --> 00:44:11,116
Oh god!

932
00:44:11,117 --> 00:44:12,718
- She's, um-

933
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:14,386
- That is wrong, but so good!

934
00:44:14,387 --> 00:44:17,156
- She's- She's uh...

935
00:44:17,157 --> 00:44:20,059
She's gone through
a lot recently.

936
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,760
- Charlie?

937
00:44:21,761 --> 00:44:23,495
- Yeah, yeah.
You're- You OK?

938
00:44:24,497 --> 00:44:25,798
Oh, OK.

939
00:44:25,799 --> 00:44:26,965
It's OK. It's OK.

940
00:44:26,966 --> 00:44:27,966
- Oh god!

941
00:44:27,967 --> 00:44:29,101
- I should get her-

942
00:44:29,102 --> 00:44:31,637
- Can I help you?
- No, no, no!

943
00:44:31,638 --> 00:44:35,674
It's easy as pie.
Um, a pleasure, sir.

944
00:44:37,043 --> 00:44:40,446
Really, I look forward to, um,
to-to hearing from you and-

945
00:44:40,447 --> 00:44:41,947
- Give me a call.

946
00:44:41,948 --> 00:44:44,750
- I'm gonna get her
outta here. I'm sorry.

947
00:44:44,751 --> 00:44:45,751
Bye!

948
00:44:45,752 --> 00:44:47,319
- To the Killer Ting!

949
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,321
- Shh!

950
00:44:50,423 --> 00:44:52,524
<i>- I'm concerned, Charlie.</i>

951
00:44:52,525 --> 00:44:54,760
I mean, I get it.

952
00:44:54,761 --> 00:44:58,664
This girl's smart,
she's interesting,

953
00:44:58,665 --> 00:45:00,532
she's insanely hot,

954
00:45:00,533 --> 00:45:03,535
she's making you live.

955
00:45:03,536 --> 00:45:05,671
So what I'm going to say,

956
00:45:05,672 --> 00:45:08,707
should be heard within
that context.

957
00:45:08,708 --> 00:45:10,642
OK.

958
00:45:10,643 --> 00:45:13,379
She's a friggin' nut!

959
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:16,315
She's bent on destroying you
in every way possible,

960
00:45:16,316 --> 00:45:19,118
your physical person,
your emotional person,

961
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:20,419
your personal person!

962
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:24,189
Add those things up,
that's a whole person!

963
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:26,225
Now, there's something
to be said for being

964
00:45:26,226 --> 00:45:28,360
exquisitely tortured
and financially bled.

965
00:45:28,361 --> 00:45:30,029
As long as
it's by the right girl.

966
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:33,132
What bothers me
is that while you do perform

967
00:45:33,133 --> 00:45:36,435
many of the traditional
functions of a boyfriend,

968
00:45:36,436 --> 00:45:38,904
you are not,
it is my understanding,

969
00:45:38,905 --> 00:45:40,105
sleeping with her.

970
00:45:40,106 --> 00:45:41,373
Is that correct?

971
00:45:41,374 --> 00:45:43,942
- You know, it is possible
for two people

972
00:45:43,943 --> 00:45:47,046
to have a relationship
without sleeping together.

973
00:45:47,047 --> 00:45:49,181
- Yes, and they have
a word for that.

974
00:45:49,182 --> 00:45:50,349
Friendship.

975
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:52,384
- Oh, sure, yeah!
Where'd you get that?

976
00:45:52,385 --> 00:45:54,687
Your German porn collection?

977
00:45:54,688 --> 00:45:57,122
Everything will work
itself out in due time.

978
00:45:57,123 --> 00:45:59,258
She is still getting over
her break-up.

979
00:45:59,259 --> 00:46:00,659
- Forget about the sex then.

980
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:03,195
Let's just talk about what
the sex brings with it:

981
00:46:03,196 --> 00:46:07,733
mainly, a little emotional
investment on her part.

982
00:46:07,734 --> 00:46:09,735
In the absence of which,

983
00:46:09,736 --> 00:46:12,905
she could really wind up
killing you, Charlie.

984
00:46:14,841 --> 00:46:16,141
<i>- OK, all right.</i>

985
00:46:16,142 --> 00:46:20,546
On the reasons-to-
stop-seeing-her side, we have

986
00:46:20,547 --> 00:46:23,148
One, on-going physical danger.

987
00:46:23,149 --> 00:46:25,951
Two, high likelihood
of a broken heart.

988
00:46:25,952 --> 00:46:29,955
Three, uh, career sabotage.

989
00:46:29,956 --> 00:46:34,226
Four, she is clinically insane.

990
00:46:34,227 --> 00:46:37,396
Five, she seems to enjoy
my pain.

991
00:46:37,397 --> 00:46:39,298
Six...

992
00:46:39,299 --> 00:46:43,335
14-piece match set of
Louis Vuitton emotional baggage.

993
00:46:44,738 --> 00:46:48,707
Seven, I haven't even
kissed her yet for god's sake!

994
00:46:48,708 --> 00:46:51,610
Uh, 5, 6, 7...

995
00:46:51,611 --> 00:46:54,013
Eight, she's ruining my life.

996
00:46:54,014 --> 00:46:57,049
- And the reasons
to keep seeing her?

997
00:46:59,919 --> 00:47:01,787
- I'm in love with her.

998
00:47:05,091 --> 00:47:06,825
- Hello.

999
00:47:08,395 --> 00:47:10,162
- I'm sorry about the interview.

1000
00:47:10,163 --> 00:47:13,599
- Yeah, I really wish
you hadn't done that.

1001
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,835
I couldn't let you just give
your life and your brain

1002
00:47:16,836 --> 00:47:18,303
<i>to those people.</i>

1003
00:47:18,304 --> 00:47:21,607
- I want to give my life
and my brain to those people.

1004
00:47:21,608 --> 00:47:23,208
- No, you don't!

1005
00:47:23,209 --> 00:47:26,745
Just think of it as
me saving you from yourself.

1006
00:47:26,746 --> 00:47:28,447
<i>- I see.</i>

1007
00:47:28,448 --> 00:47:31,684
Come on, Charlie,
that's why human beings exist!

1008
00:47:31,685 --> 00:47:33,952
To save each other
from ourselves.

1009
00:47:35,889 --> 00:47:38,190
- It's an interesting theory.

1010
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,228
- I still wanna
make it up to you.

1011
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:46,799
Tomorrow's our 33rd day
since we met.

1012
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,400
- Is it?

1013
00:47:48,401 --> 00:47:50,936
- Meet me at
Arts and Sciences, Room 105,

1014
00:47:50,937 --> 00:47:53,205
at 1:00 o'clock
tomorrow afternoon.

1015
00:47:53,206 --> 00:47:55,741
And bring a single red rose.

1016
00:47:55,742 --> 00:47:57,176
- No! No!

1017
00:47:57,177 --> 00:47:59,178
No! You know what?
You can't-

1018
00:47:59,179 --> 00:48:02,581
You can't, uh,
just boss me around, you know?

1019
00:48:02,582 --> 00:48:03,916
<i>Enough is enough.</i>

1020
00:48:03,917 --> 00:48:06,185
Hello? Are you there?
Are you there?

1021
00:48:06,186 --> 00:48:07,986
Hello? Hello?

1022
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:12,691
OK.

1023
00:48:18,531 --> 00:48:20,332
- Aw, crap!

1024
00:48:20,333 --> 00:48:22,134
Uh...

1025
00:48:23,336 --> 00:48:26,805
OK, uh, one single red rose,
like she said.

1026
00:48:43,957 --> 00:48:47,159
<i># Pachelbel's Canon #</i>

1027
00:50:06,573 --> 00:50:08,841
Whatever she was going through,

1028
00:50:08,842 --> 00:50:11,910
<i>it was beyond anything
in my experience,</i>

1029
00:50:11,911 --> 00:50:13,846
and beyond my ability to fix.

1030
00:50:14,848 --> 00:50:17,516
I had no right to judge her.

1031
00:50:17,517 --> 00:50:21,820
<i>If I chose to stay with her,
knowing the risks,</i>

1032
00:50:21,821 --> 00:50:26,859
<i>all I could do
was give her love and respect...</i>

1033
00:50:28,328 --> 00:50:30,829
and see how the story would end.

1034
00:51:02,462 --> 00:51:05,597
- I don't wear underwear
on days I play the piano.

1035
00:51:05,598 --> 00:51:06,999
- Really.

1036
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,567
- Should we get out of here?

1037
00:51:08,568 --> 00:51:09,568
- Yeah.
- Uh-

1038
00:51:11,805 --> 00:51:13,806
Aw, my feet are killing me.

1039
00:51:13,807 --> 00:51:16,642
- I could give
you a foot rub.

1040
00:51:16,643 --> 00:51:18,877
- No, no, we'll
just exchange shoes.

1041
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:22,081
- What?

1042
00:51:23,516 --> 00:51:25,017
- No!

1043
00:51:26,019 --> 00:51:27,152
No!

1044
00:51:27,153 --> 00:51:29,988
- Fine!

1045
00:51:33,493 --> 00:51:36,795
- # Dum-dee-dum-
dee-dee-do-dee #

1046
00:51:38,398 --> 00:51:40,532
These aren't gonna work.

1047
00:51:40,533 --> 00:51:41,867
- That's what I thought.

1048
00:51:41,868 --> 00:51:44,636
We didn't know if it was
sleeping, or whatever,

1049
00:51:44,637 --> 00:51:46,305
and so he was like:

1050
00:51:46,306 --> 00:51:48,307
"Why don't you throw
a rock at it?"

1051
00:51:48,308 --> 00:51:50,743
And I was like: "No,
you throw a rock at it.

1052
00:51:50,744 --> 00:51:52,644
By this point,
we were only 7 years old.

1053
00:51:52,645 --> 00:51:54,780
I didn't know if I was
right or left-handed-

1054
00:51:54,781 --> 00:51:57,383
- I bet the water isn't very
deep. What do you think?

1055
00:51:57,384 --> 00:52:00,552
- Uh, I was- I was kind of
in the middle of a-

1056
00:52:00,553 --> 00:52:02,955
I don't know.
I don't have any way to-

1057
00:52:02,956 --> 00:52:06,492
- Why don't you come sit up here
and tell me what you think?

1058
00:52:06,493 --> 00:52:08,427
- That's not gonna
help me fi-

1059
00:52:08,428 --> 00:52:10,496
It's kind of
dangerous, actually.

1060
00:52:10,497 --> 00:52:12,197
We can go to
tourist information,

1061
00:52:12,198 --> 00:52:13,465
or maybe on the Internet.

1062
00:52:13,466 --> 00:52:15,100
- Charlie, don't be
such a wuss!

1063
00:52:15,101 --> 00:52:16,802
I just wanna know
how deep it is!

1064
00:52:16,803 --> 00:52:17,803
- I'm not a wu-

1065
00:52:17,804 --> 00:52:19,405
There's a sign!
It's forbidden!

1066
00:52:19,406 --> 00:52:21,540
- Yeah, OK.
Just finish your story.

1067
00:52:29,382 --> 00:52:30,649
- Whoa!

1068
00:52:34,254 --> 00:52:35,587
- Whoopsie!

1069
00:52:35,588 --> 00:52:37,623
- Why me?

1070
00:52:37,624 --> 00:52:40,325
- Well, that's
surprisingly deep.

1071
00:52:49,369 --> 00:52:51,103
Charlie!

1072
00:52:54,808 --> 00:52:56,909
- OK, OK.

1073
00:52:58,178 --> 00:53:00,245
- Was that deep enough for you?

1074
00:53:00,246 --> 00:53:01,246
- So it's true?

1075
00:53:01,247 --> 00:53:02,247
- What?

1076
00:53:02,248 --> 00:53:05,117
- You don't wear
underwear on recital days.

1077
00:53:05,118 --> 00:53:06,151
- I never lie.

1078
00:53:21,067 --> 00:53:22,868
- Oh, wow!

1079
00:53:39,352 --> 00:53:41,353
Oh! Damn it!

1080
00:53:43,289 --> 00:53:44,423
- Yes! Yes!

1081
00:53:44,424 --> 00:53:46,325
- Sorry.
I'm sorry!

1082
00:53:46,326 --> 00:53:47,593
- Great!

1083
00:53:47,594 --> 00:53:48,594
- Um, sorry.

1084
00:53:48,595 --> 00:53:50,195
- Jordan.

1085
00:53:50,196 --> 00:53:52,031
- It's late.

1086
00:53:52,032 --> 00:53:53,699
- Could be worse.

1087
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:55,100
- Good night, young man.

1088
00:53:55,101 --> 00:53:56,468
- It's OK.

1089
00:53:57,937 --> 00:53:59,672
- I-I'm sorry.

1090
00:53:59,673 --> 00:54:01,774
- I said goodnight, young man.

1091
00:54:01,775 --> 00:54:02,941
- Dad, enough, OK?

1092
00:54:02,942 --> 00:54:05,444
I'm allowed to have
whoever I want over.

1093
00:54:05,445 --> 00:54:07,446
- I'm sick and tired of it.
I've had it!

1094
00:54:07,447 --> 00:54:09,114
- I don't want to
hear it anymore!

1095
00:54:09,115 --> 00:54:10,849
- ... loss of control
over yourself!

1096
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:12,518
I told you not to
see him anymore!

1097
00:54:12,519 --> 00:54:13,552
Do you understand me?

1098
00:54:13,553 --> 00:54:15,654
- What you're trying
to do is not helping.

1099
00:54:15,655 --> 00:54:17,656
- How do you know what
I'm trying to do?

1100
00:54:17,657 --> 00:54:18,657
- You know what-

1101
00:54:18,658 --> 00:54:20,592
- I'm trying to make
you responsible...

1102
00:54:20,593 --> 00:54:22,194
<i># I've seen faces around #</i>

1103
00:54:22,195 --> 00:54:24,830
<i>- I didn't hear from her
for a couple weeks.</i>

1104
00:54:24,831 --> 00:54:26,832
<i># While many often
bring me down #</i>

1105
00:54:26,833 --> 00:54:28,100
<i>Three weeks, actually.</i>

1106
00:54:28,101 --> 00:54:29,201
<i># Spin me around... #</i>

1107
00:54:29,202 --> 00:54:31,837
<i>And 4 days... 9 hours,</i>

1108
00:54:31,838 --> 00:54:36,709
<i>20 minutes,
6 and a half seconds... roughly.</i>

1109
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:40,879
<i># This crazy situation's been
runnin' my mind... #</i>

1110
00:54:44,417 --> 00:54:47,453
<i># To satisfy my superstitions #</i>

1111
00:54:47,454 --> 00:54:48,787
<i># You see me runnin'... #</i>

1112
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:52,725
- I have to go to the bathroom.

1113
00:54:52,726 --> 00:54:54,326
- OK!

1114
00:54:54,327 --> 00:54:57,296
<i># With superstitions #</i>

1115
00:54:57,297 --> 00:54:58,530

1116
00:55:01,301 --> 00:55:03,102
<i># Need contradictions #</i>

1117
00:55:05,972 --> 00:55:07,840
<i># For my superstitions #</i>

1118
00:55:07,841 --> 00:55:09,241
- Hello.

1119
00:55:09,242 --> 00:55:11,510
- It's me.

1120
00:55:11,511 --> 00:55:13,645
- Hi.

1121
00:55:13,646 --> 00:55:16,148
- Come to the restaurant
near the park.

1122
00:55:16,149 --> 00:55:17,616
<i>Now.</i>

1123
00:55:17,617 --> 00:55:19,284
- Uh, why?

1124
00:55:19,285 --> 00:55:21,453
- 'Cause there's someone
I want you to meet.

1125
00:55:22,489 --> 00:55:23,789
- Who?

1126
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:25,657
- A guy.

1127
00:55:27,394 --> 00:55:29,261
- I can't.

1128
00:55:29,262 --> 00:55:30,763
- Why not?

1129
00:55:31,798 --> 00:55:34,833
- I am out with a girl.

1130
00:55:34,834 --> 00:55:36,802
- No, you're not.

1131
00:55:36,803 --> 00:55:38,470
- Yeah, I am.

1132
00:55:38,471 --> 00:55:40,005
- Are you on your way?

1133
00:55:40,006 --> 00:55:41,907
- No, I'm not coming!

1134
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:13,038
Nice penis. Gotta go!

1135
00:56:16,042 --> 00:56:18,977
- That was really, really nice.

1136
00:56:18,978 --> 00:56:21,647
- You should've called me.
Why didn't you call me?

1137
00:56:21,648 --> 00:56:23,415
- I know,
I shouldn't be drinking.

1138
00:56:23,416 --> 00:56:24,750
- I told you!

1139
00:56:26,586 --> 00:56:27,619
- Hello?

1140
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:28,854
- Hi!

1141
00:56:30,256 --> 00:56:32,191
I'm Jean-Jacques.

1142
00:56:33,593 --> 00:56:34,693
It's nice to meet you.

1143
00:56:34,694 --> 00:56:36,462
- Nice to meet you.

1144
00:56:37,497 --> 00:56:39,331
- Please, have a seat.

1145
00:56:44,704 --> 00:56:46,872
- Were you really
with a girl?

1146
00:56:48,675 --> 00:56:51,410
- No, I was with a guy.

1147
00:56:53,246 --> 00:56:54,980
- I knew it.

1148
00:56:54,981 --> 00:56:59,351
- Well, uh, Charlie,
I've heard a lot about you.

1149
00:56:59,352 --> 00:57:00,886
- Have you?

1150
00:57:02,722 --> 00:57:05,324
- I understand you're
a good friend of Jordan's.

1151
00:57:10,830 --> 00:57:12,197
- That's right.

1152
00:57:15,135 --> 00:57:17,036
- Would you excuse me, please?

1153
00:57:45,265 --> 00:57:46,999
- Where's Charlie?

1154
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,834
- He left.

1155
00:57:48,835 --> 00:57:51,403
He said he had to study.

1156
00:57:51,404 --> 00:57:53,105
- Oh.

1157
00:57:53,106 --> 00:57:56,675
- You were right.
I liked him very much.

1158
00:57:58,111 --> 00:58:01,380
In fact, he gave me 10 rules
to follow in our relationship,

1159
00:58:02,682 --> 00:58:06,385
which I thought was
a little odd, but generous.

1160
00:58:07,387 --> 00:58:08,954
- What were they?

1161
00:58:08,955 --> 00:58:10,689
- Let's see.

1162
00:58:12,359 --> 00:58:14,793
First, don't let her drink.

1163
00:58:14,794 --> 00:58:17,896
When she does,
use the fireman's carry.

1164
00:58:20,266 --> 00:58:22,501
Be prepared to go to jail.

1165
00:58:24,137 --> 00:58:26,905
<i>- Don't expect
a lot of help from her dad.</i>

1166
00:58:28,508 --> 00:58:31,810
Whatever you think
is gonna happen next,

1167
00:58:31,811 --> 00:58:33,612
you're wrong.

1168
00:58:36,149 --> 00:58:38,917
If her feet hurt,
exchange shoes with her.

1169
00:58:40,186 --> 00:58:42,588
<i>Learn to say
the following phrase</i>

1170
00:58:42,589 --> 00:58:45,624
over and over to yourself:

1171
00:58:45,625 --> 00:58:48,560
It's all part of the charm.

1172
00:58:53,099 --> 00:58:58,037
On your 33rd day together,
bring her a single rose.

1173
00:58:58,038 --> 00:59:01,273
Give it to her
in her recital class.

1174
00:59:06,846 --> 00:59:10,349
If she says she's
gonna kill you,

1175
00:59:10,350 --> 00:59:13,318
don't assume
it's a metaphor.

1176
00:59:16,389 --> 00:59:20,359
<i>She likes to write.
Encourage her.</i>

1177
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:23,662
<i>And finally,
your time with her</i>

1178
00:59:23,663 --> 00:59:27,566
<i>will be the happiest
you've been in your life.</i>

1179
00:59:29,736 --> 00:59:32,237
Enjoy every second.

1180
00:59:39,579 --> 00:59:41,313
- Hey, watch out!

1181
00:59:56,963 --> 00:59:58,530
- Charlie.

1182
01:00:08,241 --> 01:00:09,641
Wake up!

1183
01:00:09,642 --> 01:00:11,310
Hey, wake up!

1184
01:00:11,311 --> 01:00:12,678
- What?

1185
01:00:14,447 --> 01:00:18,150
<i>Attention passengers on...
downtown platform.</i>

1186
01:00:18,151 --> 01:00:20,219
<i>- What kind of diction
is that?</i>

1187
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:21,887
How could anyone
understand you?

1188
01:00:21,888 --> 01:00:24,123
- Should I make the
announcement at all?

1189
01:00:24,124 --> 01:00:26,058
Because I could
easily forget the whole-

1190
01:00:26,059 --> 01:00:27,259
- I would rather,

1191
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:30,162
if you're gonna do
something nice for someone,

1192
01:00:30,163 --> 01:00:32,731
that you did it
properly and well.

1193
01:00:32,732 --> 01:00:35,334
<i>- This PA system is
50 years old!</i>

1194
01:00:35,335 --> 01:00:38,070
If the queen of England made
the announcement

1195
01:00:38,071 --> 01:00:39,738
you wouldn't understand it!

1196
01:00:39,739 --> 01:00:42,274
- The queen wouldn't step foot
in this shithole!

1197
01:00:44,077 --> 01:00:46,578
<i>- I'll tell you what.
You make the announcement.</i>

1198
01:00:46,579 --> 01:00:48,447
We'll see if
you can do any better.

1199
01:00:48,448 --> 01:00:50,749
- Well, it couldn't
be any worse, right?

1200
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:52,818
Let's see.

1201
01:00:52,819 --> 01:00:54,486
- Charlie? I'm sorry.

1202
01:00:54,487 --> 01:00:57,356
<i>He's just a guy my father
made me go out with.</i>

1203
01:00:57,357 --> 01:00:58,424
- Sorry!

1204
01:00:58,425 --> 01:01:00,359
<i>- Every second
I was with him,</i>

1205
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:01,994
I was wishing it was you,

1206
01:01:01,995 --> 01:01:03,796
<i>and that's why
I called you tonight.</i>

1207
01:01:03,797 --> 01:01:05,164
I couldn't take it anymore.

1208
01:01:05,165 --> 01:01:06,498
- That's him!

1209
01:01:06,499 --> 01:01:08,300
<i>- Charlie, I need you.</i>

1210
01:01:08,301 --> 01:01:11,403
Please, come to the
station master's office, OK?

1211
01:01:12,405 --> 01:01:14,973
She's this rat-faced
woman, all right?

1212
01:01:14,974 --> 01:01:16,475
But she'll let you in.

1213
01:01:16,476 --> 01:01:19,211
OK? She's on the second floor.

1214
01:01:19,212 --> 01:01:23,816
Charlie, please, just come
to the station master's office.

1215
01:01:23,817 --> 01:01:25,718
I'm sorry.
Just don't...

1216
01:01:25,719 --> 01:01:27,486
Don't leave me.

1217
01:01:28,521 --> 01:01:30,389
Charlie!

1218
01:01:30,390 --> 01:01:32,257
<i>- Charlie!
Praise Jesus!</i>

1219
01:01:34,627 --> 01:01:36,028
All right?

1220
01:01:36,029 --> 01:01:37,830
You can go now.

1221
01:01:43,703 --> 01:01:45,871
Wait! Who said
you could hug me?

1222
01:01:46,906 --> 01:01:48,507
- Nobody!

1223
01:01:48,508 --> 01:01:50,776
- I like the way
you handle me. Come on!

1224
01:01:54,748 --> 01:01:57,850
<i>- That night, all she wanted
to do was dance.</i>

1225
01:01:57,851 --> 01:02:01,387
<i># You and I #</i>

1226
01:02:01,388 --> 01:02:04,723

01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:38,457
<i># Gave us a fine romance #</i>

1236
01:02:38,458 --> 01:02:39,558

<i># When you're near me #</i>

<i># I'm in love #</i>

1241
01:02:54,474 --> 01:02:57,376
<i>- But unfortunately she
drank too much and passed out.</i>

1242
01:02:57,377 --> 01:03:00,212
<i># I'm in love #</i>

1243
01:03:02,415 --> 01:03:05,284
<i># I'm in love #</i>

1244
01:03:16,563 --> 01:03:18,063
Sir...

1245
01:03:18,064 --> 01:03:22,468
Would you mind, uh, taking
the long way through the park?

1246
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:34,813
- Hey, Charlie!

1247
01:03:34,814 --> 01:03:35,948
How's it goin'?

1248
01:03:35,949 --> 01:03:37,649
- Good, Jimmy!
Thank you.

1249
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:40,686
- OK. Oh!
Oh, here we go.

1250
01:03:40,687 --> 01:03:42,154
- She's- she's-

1251
01:03:42,155 --> 01:03:43,389
- OK!

1252
01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:44,423
- OK.

1253
01:03:44,424 --> 01:03:45,691
- Hello, Miss Roark.

1254
01:03:46,693 --> 01:03:48,460
How you doin'?
- Good.

1255
01:03:50,296 --> 01:03:51,764
- Thank you.

1256
01:03:51,765 --> 01:03:53,699
- Yep! See you
next Thursday!

1257
01:04:01,141 --> 01:04:03,042
<i>- Hello.</i>

1258
01:04:03,043 --> 01:04:05,077
- Are you thinking about me?

1259
01:04:06,212 --> 01:04:08,547
<i>- Yeah, um,
are you feeling beter?</i>

1260
01:04:08,548 --> 01:04:10,315
- Yes.

1261
01:04:11,518 --> 01:04:12,918
- What are you
laughing at?

1262
01:04:12,919 --> 01:04:15,654
- Write me a letter telling
me how you feel about me.

1263
01:04:15,655 --> 01:04:18,657
In truthful prose that is
deeply moving and not baroque.

1264
01:04:18,658 --> 01:04:20,526
Don't overwrite.
I cannot bear that.

1265
01:04:20,527 --> 01:04:21,527
- OK.

1266
01:04:21,528 --> 01:04:23,228
- I'm gonna write
a letter to you

1267
01:04:23,229 --> 01:04:24,930
telling you how
I feel about you.

1268
01:04:24,931 --> 01:04:25,931
- Are you?

1269
01:04:25,932 --> 01:04:27,199
- Mm-hmm. And believe me,

1270
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,635
my letter is going to be
extremely well-written.

1271
01:04:29,636 --> 01:04:30,636
- I'm sure.

1272
01:04:30,637 --> 01:04:32,204
- So work hard on your letter.

1273
01:04:32,205 --> 01:04:35,174
Otherwise you're gonna be
embarrassed by the comparison.

1274
01:04:35,175 --> 01:04:36,175
- I will!

1275
01:04:36,176 --> 01:04:37,776
- Bring it to Central Park.

1276
01:04:37,777 --> 01:04:40,579
I'll meet you at the
promenade at 2:00 o'clock.

1277
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:42,114
- OK.

1278
01:04:42,115 --> 01:04:43,916
- Write well.

1279
01:04:43,917 --> 01:04:47,453
- Yeah, um, you too.

1280
01:04:47,454 --> 01:04:49,421
- Oh, I will.

1281
01:05:04,904 --> 01:05:07,006
- What?

1282
01:05:08,408 --> 01:05:10,509
Do you suppose
someone could be heard

1283
01:05:10,510 --> 01:05:12,411
from all the way
at the other end?

1284
01:05:12,412 --> 01:05:13,946
- Yeah!

1285
01:05:13,947 --> 01:05:17,016
Well, no.
May-

1286
01:05:17,017 --> 01:05:19,184
Maybe. Maybe.
It's very far.

1287
01:05:19,185 --> 01:05:22,354
I think- I think if you had one
person who was extremely loud

1288
01:05:22,355 --> 01:05:24,189
and the other person
had good hearing.

1289
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:25,190
- Go over there.

1290
01:05:26,459 --> 01:05:29,928
I'll scream something from
here and answer if you hear me.

1291
01:05:29,929 --> 01:05:33,132
- You want me to go
all the way down there?

1292
01:05:33,133 --> 01:05:34,833
Just so you can...

1293
01:05:34,834 --> 01:05:36,402
- Yeah.

1294
01:05:37,437 --> 01:05:39,838
- All the way down
to the end?

1295
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:41,840
- Yes.

1296
01:06:00,193 --> 01:06:02,094
Charlie!

1297
01:06:02,095 --> 01:06:04,430
Can you hear me?

1298
01:06:10,937 --> 01:06:13,405
Charlie, can you hear me?

1299
01:06:17,677 --> 01:06:19,545
I'm sorry!

1300
01:06:20,814 --> 01:06:23,349
I'm so sorry, I-

1301
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:25,951
I can't help it.
I-

1302
01:06:25,952 --> 01:06:28,287
I can't help it!

1303
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:32,558
I thought I was different!

1304
01:06:34,394 --> 01:06:37,096
I thought I was stronger,
but I'm not.

1305
01:07:01,888 --> 01:07:04,456
- Why do we have
a cocktail shaker?

1306
01:07:08,995 --> 01:07:10,729
Were you crying before?

1307
01:07:10,730 --> 01:07:13,799
- It's a time capsule.
Give me your letter.

1308
01:07:14,801 --> 01:07:15,968
- Why?

1309
01:07:15,969 --> 01:07:18,103
- We're gonna put 'em
in here and bury them,

1310
01:07:18,104 --> 01:07:19,471
and exactly a year from now,

1311
01:07:19,472 --> 01:07:21,840
we're gonna come back
and we're gonna dig it up,

1312
01:07:21,841 --> 01:07:24,576
read the letters, and maybe
then we'll have the answer.

1313
01:07:24,577 --> 01:07:26,478
- What's the question?

1314
01:07:26,479 --> 01:07:29,648
- The question is,
are we going to be together?

1315
01:07:29,649 --> 01:07:32,284
- Well, I'm glad
that's the question.

1316
01:07:32,285 --> 01:07:34,687
Why do we have to wait
a year to find out?

1317
01:07:34,688 --> 01:07:37,022
- I explain it in my letter.

1318
01:07:43,296 --> 01:07:45,898
- Which I have to wait a year
to read.

1319
01:07:48,234 --> 01:07:51,670
A year is a long time.
A lot can happen.

1320
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:55,407
- Yeah.

1321
01:08:06,486 --> 01:08:10,189
We'll meet back here,
under the tree,

1322
01:08:10,190 --> 01:08:12,091
exactly a year from now.

1323
01:08:15,929 --> 01:08:18,163
At 2:00 O'clock, OK?

1324
01:08:25,405 --> 01:08:27,339
<i># I put a record on #</i>

1325
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:28,340
- Good?

1326
01:08:28,341 --> 01:08:29,341
- Yeah.

1327
01:08:30,910 --> 01:08:35,414
<i># Put it on and sing along
with you #</i>

1328
01:08:36,783 --> 01:08:39,551
<i># Sing along with you #</i>

1329
01:08:42,956 --> 01:08:44,923
Come on.

1330
01:08:49,796 --> 01:08:53,399
<i># And that's OK by me #</i>

1331
01:08:54,434 --> 01:08:56,168
<i># That's OK #</i>

1332
01:08:56,169 --> 01:08:57,436
You take the first one.

1333
01:08:57,437 --> 01:08:59,038
<i># Because in a way I'm free... #</i>

1334
01:08:59,039 --> 01:09:00,339
- We could ride together.

1335
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:01,807
- No, I'll take the next one.

1336
01:09:01,808 --> 01:09:04,576
If I don't say goodbye to you
now, I won't be able to.

1337
01:09:04,577 --> 01:09:06,578
- Then don't.

1338
01:09:06,579 --> 01:09:08,280
- I have to.

1339
01:09:09,315 --> 01:09:10,482
- Why?

1340
01:09:10,483 --> 01:09:12,551
- It's in the letter.

1341
01:09:14,587 --> 01:09:16,789
<i># I will try #</i>

1342
01:09:16,790 --> 01:09:17,823
- Right.

1343
01:09:17,824 --> 01:09:20,959
<i># And dry my eyes #</i>

1344
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:25,497
<i># And I'm OK
if we're drinkin' #</i>

1345
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:31,236
<i># Grab a beer
and disappear with me #</i>

1346
01:09:32,272 --> 01:09:34,740
<i># Disappear with me #</i>

1347
01:09:37,811 --> 01:09:41,046
<i># And I put a record on #</i>

1348
01:09:42,949 --> 01:09:47,953
<i># I put it on
and get it one with you #</i>

1349
01:09:49,122 --> 01:09:51,290
<i># Get it on with you #</i>

1350
01:09:52,325 --> 01:09:53,759
- Jordan?

1351
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:55,728
- Charlie!

1352
01:09:55,729 --> 01:09:57,629
<i># This time #</i>

1353
01:09:57,630 --> 01:09:58,697
Charlie?

1354
01:09:58,698 --> 01:09:59,698
<i># You'll find #</i>

1355
01:09:59,699 --> 01:10:00,966
Where are you?
Charlie!

1356
01:10:00,967 --> 01:10:03,435
<i># Some other
gonna mess your mind #</i>

1357
01:10:03,436 --> 01:10:06,338
<i># It's too late or too soon #</i>

1358
01:10:08,241 --> 01:10:12,511
<i># Some other gonna come #</i>

1359
01:10:13,546 --> 01:10:17,750
<i># Come too soon #</i>

1360
01:10:18,752 --> 01:10:20,919
<i># Put it on #</i>

1361
01:10:22,422 --> 01:10:26,225
<i># I will try and dry my eyes #</i>

1362
01:10:26,226 --> 01:10:27,960
<i># Put it on #</i>

1363
01:10:32,832 --> 01:10:35,668
- I knew what she'd be thinking.

1364
01:10:35,669 --> 01:10:38,270
We were meant to be separated.

1365
01:10:41,207 --> 01:10:43,976
So that's how we broke up.

1366
01:10:48,348 --> 01:10:50,983
<i>Among my goals
for the next year,</i>

1367
01:10:50,984 --> 01:10:54,119
were to improve myself for
when we got back together.

1368
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:56,588
It wasn't gonna be easy.

1369
01:10:56,589 --> 01:11:01,226
<i>I had what you call
"poor hand-eye coordination",</i>

1370
01:11:02,996 --> 01:11:04,897
and no natural buoyancy.

1371
01:11:06,366 --> 01:11:08,100
Oh!

1372
01:11:08,101 --> 01:11:11,170
But what I lacked in ability,
I made up for in determination.

1373
01:11:11,171 --> 01:11:14,306
<i>Within 6 months,
I was beating Mr. Snapperstein.</i>

1374
01:11:15,308 --> 01:11:16,475
- Oy!

1375
01:11:16,476 --> 01:11:19,111
<i>- I could swim the crawl.</i>

1376
01:11:20,714 --> 01:11:23,248
<i>And, my kendo instructor
stopped calling me</i>

1377
01:11:23,249 --> 01:11:24,917
"He Who Dies Repeatedly".

1378
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:30,055
I filed a Hail Mary application
with the Tiller King people.

1379
01:11:30,056 --> 01:11:32,091
<i>But I didn't hold out
a lot of hope.</i>

1380
01:11:32,092 --> 01:11:35,160
<i>As a backup,
I took Estate Planning,</i>

1381
01:11:35,161 --> 01:11:39,765
<i>which was only slightly
less boring than actually dying.</i>

1382
01:11:41,101 --> 01:11:45,137
<i>Leo met new
and interesting people.</i>

1383
01:11:45,138 --> 01:11:47,873
Um, this was before anyone peed.

1384
01:11:49,175 --> 01:11:53,345
<i>My feelings for Jordan
didn't diminish at all.</i>

1385
01:11:53,346 --> 01:11:55,814
But then, I didn't want them to.

1386
01:11:57,150 --> 01:11:58,450
- Oh!
- Whoa!

1387
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:02,855
- You have to go out
with other people.

1388
01:12:02,856 --> 01:12:05,257
You can't just sit
around waiting for a year.

1389
01:12:06,626 --> 01:12:09,361
- Because it's unwatchable!

1390
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:12,531
- Jordan.

1391
01:12:13,933 --> 01:12:15,701
- Why not?

1392
01:12:15,702 --> 01:12:19,438
- Because what would
be the point?

1393
01:12:22,142 --> 01:12:24,410
- Twelve.

1394
01:12:24,411 --> 01:12:26,845
Just go out with
12 regular girls,

1395
01:12:26,846 --> 01:12:28,781
as a personal favour to me.

1396
01:12:29,783 --> 01:12:31,817
- Eight.
- Ten

1397
01:12:32,819 --> 01:12:34,887
- Ten.

1398
01:12:34,888 --> 01:12:36,922
- I mean, I wouldn't mind...

1399
01:12:36,923 --> 01:12:40,859
<i># She won't stop
to teach them all... #</i>

1400
01:12:42,328 --> 01:12:45,164
- Sort of like an MBA
in the mind, huh?

1401
01:12:45,165 --> 01:12:46,465
- Yeah.

1402
01:12:46,466 --> 01:12:47,866
- Um, um, uh...

1403
01:12:47,867 --> 01:12:50,903
- If you knew that, you wouldn't
have done that. Or would you?

1404
01:12:50,904 --> 01:12:52,171
- Um...
- I'm sorry!

1405
01:12:52,172 --> 01:12:53,872
- I, uh, OK.

1406
01:12:55,308 --> 01:12:57,309
- C-H-E-R-R-I-S
- Tremendously...

1407
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:03,282
- Yeah, I don't think
this is gonna work.

1408
01:13:03,283 --> 01:13:06,819
<i>- Anyway, it made
the time go by faster.</i>

1409
01:13:06,820 --> 01:13:08,787
Finally, the day came.

1410
01:13:08,788 --> 01:13:12,324
I- I was a little nervous.
A little bit, you know.

1411
01:13:12,325 --> 01:13:14,893
Slightly on edge.

1412
01:13:14,894 --> 01:13:16,962
- Want me to go with you?

1413
01:13:18,098 --> 01:13:20,065
- Why would I-

1414
01:13:21,601 --> 01:13:23,769
Why would I possibly?

1415
01:13:23,770 --> 01:13:25,337
- OK.

1416
01:13:26,573 --> 01:13:28,474
- But thank you.

1417
01:13:29,909 --> 01:13:31,176
- That's the bathroom.

1418
01:13:31,177 --> 01:13:32,411
- I know!

1419
01:13:58,938 --> 01:14:00,973
<i>I was, of course, early</i>

1420
01:14:00,974 --> 01:14:03,575
and she was, of course, late.

1421
01:14:12,485 --> 01:14:16,422
<i>I didn't start to worry
until 2:30, 2:45.</i>

1422
01:14:16,423 --> 01:14:20,626
Uh, by 3:00 I still wanted
to wait just a little longer,

1423
01:14:20,627 --> 01:14:23,896
<i>but by 4:00,
I had to face facts.</i>

1424
01:14:23,897 --> 01:14:26,031
<i>She wasn't coming.</i>

1425
01:14:27,267 --> 01:14:29,768
<i>And there was
only one thing to do.</i>

1426
01:14:58,298 --> 01:15:03,535
<i>- Dear Charlie.
Hi. How was your year?</i>

1427
01:15:03,536 --> 01:15:06,638
<i>Charlie, I have some things
to tell you.</i>

1428
01:15:06,639 --> 01:15:07,873
<i>When we first met,</i>

1429
01:15:07,874 --> 01:15:10,309
<i>I said that my fiancée
had broken up with me.</i>

1430
01:15:10,310 --> 01:15:11,910
<i>That was a lie.</i>

1431
01:15:11,911 --> 01:15:14,580
Truth is he passed away.

1432
01:15:14,581 --> 01:15:18,150
<i>All he said in his note
was that he was sorry,</i>

1433
01:15:18,151 --> 01:15:20,686
<i>but that there was
too much pain.</i>

1434
01:15:25,892 --> 01:15:28,460
<i>I was devastated.
I couldn't accept it.</i>

1435
01:15:28,461 --> 01:15:29,762
You know, I began to drink,

1436
01:15:29,763 --> 01:15:32,064
<i>which, as you've seen,
I'm not very good at.</i>

1437
01:15:32,065 --> 01:15:36,001
Oh, and I was frequently brought
home by strangers in taxi cabs,

1438
01:15:37,003 --> 01:15:38,303
and that's why my father

1439
01:15:38,304 --> 01:15:40,172
<i>acted the way
he did towards you.</i>

1440
01:15:40,173 --> 01:15:43,876
Honestly, if you ever get to
know him, he's a very nice man.

1441
01:15:45,812 --> 01:15:48,681
<i>I was very close
to my fiancée's mother.</i>

1442
01:15:48,682 --> 01:15:52,317
<i>I tried to go see her
a little while after he died.</i>

1443
01:15:52,318 --> 01:15:56,588
She said she had a great guy
she wanted to introduce me to.

1444
01:15:56,589 --> 01:15:58,991
<i>I couldn't bear
the thought of it.</i>

1445
01:16:00,393 --> 01:16:01,794
<i>And then I met you.</i>

1446
01:16:02,829 --> 01:16:05,230
You reminded me of him.

1447
01:16:05,231 --> 01:16:07,800
You were both strong and kind

1448
01:16:07,801 --> 01:16:10,703
and confident...
in your own way.

1449
01:16:10,704 --> 01:16:12,938
Charles Bellow.

1450
01:16:15,809 --> 01:16:17,309
- Charlie.

1451
01:16:19,312 --> 01:16:21,847
<i>- Hmm. You even look like him.</i>

1452
01:16:21,848 --> 01:16:24,116
<i>And there were
many other parallels.</i>

1453
01:16:24,117 --> 01:16:27,753
<i>They were small,
but they seemed important.</i>

1454
01:16:29,356 --> 01:16:32,057
<i>He and I met
on a subway platform.</i>

1455
01:16:32,058 --> 01:16:33,726
<i>Just as you and I met.</i>

1456
01:16:36,329 --> 01:16:38,997
<i>Like you, he carried
a handkerchief.</i>

1457
01:16:40,934 --> 01:16:44,370
I was very sick at the time
and he took care of me...

1458
01:16:45,705 --> 01:16:47,439
<i>like you did.</i>

1459
01:16:53,213 --> 01:16:55,781
<i>As you and I
got to know each other,</i>

1460
01:16:55,782 --> 01:16:58,617
<i>I felt the cloud begin
to lift a little bit.</i>

1461
01:16:58,618 --> 01:17:00,152
I thought this was because

1462
01:17:00,153 --> 01:17:03,088
<i>of the similarities
between you and him.</i>

1463
01:17:04,524 --> 01:17:06,225
<i>And so I decided
that you and I</i>

1464
01:17:06,226 --> 01:17:08,560
<i>would do everything
he and I had done.</i>

1465
01:17:08,561 --> 01:17:11,964
<i>That way, it would be almost
like he had never died</i>

1466
01:17:11,965 --> 01:17:13,565
and the pain would stop.

1467
01:17:17,504 --> 01:17:19,672
<i>Because on
our 33rd day together,</i>

1468
01:17:19,673 --> 01:17:21,573
he brought a rose to my class,

1469
01:17:21,574 --> 01:17:23,942
I asked you to do the same.

1470
01:17:26,946 --> 01:17:30,582
Because he and I planned
our future under this tree,

1471
01:17:30,583 --> 01:17:33,252
<i>I chose it
for you and me as well.</i>

1472
01:17:38,858 --> 01:17:41,160
<i>Because he and I had
a favourite restaurant...</i>

1473
01:17:41,161 --> 01:17:42,161
Cheers!

1474
01:17:42,162 --> 01:17:43,929
<i>I brought you there.</i>

1475
01:17:43,930 --> 01:17:47,032
<i>And because he died
in the ocean...</i>

1476
01:17:47,033 --> 01:17:49,535
I pushed you to go in...

1477
01:17:50,837 --> 01:17:52,438
<i>and then saved you.</i>

1478
01:17:52,439 --> 01:17:54,540
<i>All of this was crazy</i>

1479
01:17:54,541 --> 01:17:57,910
and selfish and wrong, I know.

1480
01:17:57,911 --> 01:18:00,312
But grief can make us crazy.

1481
01:18:01,314 --> 01:18:02,948
Anyway, it didn't work

1482
01:18:02,949 --> 01:18:04,350
<i>And at a certain point,</i>

1483
01:18:04,351 --> 01:18:07,619
I realized I didn't like you
because you were like him.

1484
01:18:07,620 --> 01:18:08,887
- Whoa!

1485
01:18:08,888 --> 01:18:11,357
<i>- I liked you
because I liked you.</i>

1486
01:18:11,358 --> 01:18:13,625
<i>But every time
I started to be happy,</i>

1487
01:18:13,626 --> 01:18:15,527
<i>I would stop myself.</i>

1488
01:18:15,528 --> 01:18:17,996
It felt wrong to be happy.

1489
01:18:17,997 --> 01:18:21,667
It felt wrong to let go,
to just forget about him,

1490
01:18:21,668 --> 01:18:23,435
<i>even for just a minute.</i>

1491
01:18:23,436 --> 01:18:25,671
<i>It felt like
I was betraying him.</i>

1492
01:18:26,706 --> 01:18:28,607
All I could do was hurt you

1493
01:18:28,608 --> 01:18:30,476
and that's not me, Charlie.

1494
01:18:30,477 --> 01:18:32,378
<i>That's not me at all.</i>

1495
01:18:32,379 --> 01:18:35,547
<i>And someday,
I hope I can show you as much.</i>

1496
01:18:41,021 --> 01:18:43,022
Something had to be done.

1497
01:18:43,023 --> 01:18:45,691
<i>In order for us to have
a chance in the future,</i>

1498
01:18:45,692 --> 01:18:47,993
<i>I had to make a break
with the past.</i>

1499
01:18:49,195 --> 01:18:51,363
<i>And for this,
I needed time.</i>

1500
01:18:55,235 --> 01:18:57,970
I hope I've healed during
our year apart.

1501
01:18:57,971 --> 01:19:01,440
And that I'm sitting with you
while you read this.

1502
01:19:08,314 --> 01:19:11,684
But if I'm not...

1503
01:19:11,685 --> 01:19:14,520
It's not because
I don't love you.

1504
01:19:14,521 --> 01:19:16,855
Because I do.

1505
01:19:18,358 --> 01:19:21,260
And it's not because
I don't miss you.

1506
01:19:22,662 --> 01:19:24,997
Because I miss you already.

1507
01:19:27,267 --> 01:19:30,002
It'll just mean
that I'm not better.

1508
01:19:31,905 --> 01:19:34,306
And that the story
isn't over yet.

1509
01:19:40,613 --> 01:19:43,682
<i>Will you wait for me, Charlie?
Can you wait?</i>

1510
01:19:43,683 --> 01:19:46,318
<i>With all my heart,
I hope you can.</i>

1511
01:19:46,319 --> 01:19:48,287
<i>Love, Jordan.</i>

1512
01:20:11,878 --> 01:20:14,446
- Sir, is everything OK?

1513
01:20:15,915 --> 01:20:17,249
- Yes.

1514
01:20:18,752 --> 01:20:21,420
Oh, yes.

1515
01:20:21,421 --> 01:20:23,689
Forgive me for staring.

1516
01:20:23,690 --> 01:20:27,092
When I was younger, I would've
tried to be more discreet.

1517
01:20:27,093 --> 01:20:30,229
But at my age,
I don't pretend anymore.

1518
01:20:30,230 --> 01:20:31,263
What's the point?

1519
01:20:31,264 --> 01:20:32,865
- I understand.

1520
01:20:34,567 --> 01:20:37,002
- So it's OK
with you if I stare?

1521
01:20:37,003 --> 01:20:39,471
- Stare away if you'd like.

1522
01:20:41,107 --> 01:20:43,976
- That's great.
Thank you, thank you.

1523
01:20:43,977 --> 01:20:45,711
- Is this your tree?

1524
01:20:45,712 --> 01:20:47,279
Yes.

1525
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:50,449
Well, not exactly,

1526
01:20:50,450 --> 01:20:54,620
but this tree
and I have a secret.

1527
01:20:54,621 --> 01:20:56,388
- You do!

1528
01:20:56,389 --> 01:20:58,824
So do this tree and I.

1529
01:21:01,094 --> 01:21:02,795
- Is this your rock pile?

1530
01:21:04,297 --> 01:21:05,631
- Yes.

1531
01:21:05,632 --> 01:21:07,599
- What does it mark?

1532
01:21:10,403 --> 01:21:12,638
- Well...

1533
01:21:12,639 --> 01:21:15,307
A year and a day ago,
my boyfriend and I,

1534
01:21:15,308 --> 01:21:16,742
we buried letters here.

1535
01:21:16,743 --> 01:21:20,012
We promised to meet back
a year later to read them,

1536
01:21:20,013 --> 01:21:21,980
but I didn't show up yesterday.

1537
01:21:21,981 --> 01:21:23,716
- I see.

1538
01:21:23,717 --> 01:21:25,851
- What's your secret?

1539
01:21:27,387 --> 01:21:29,788
- Tell me, have
you been back here

1540
01:21:29,789 --> 01:21:31,724
since you buried
the letters?

1541
01:21:31,725 --> 01:21:33,425
- No.

1542
01:21:33,426 --> 01:21:36,228
- Do you know what's
happened in the meantime?

1543
01:21:36,229 --> 01:21:37,830
- No.

1544
01:21:37,831 --> 01:21:40,332
- Look closely at the tree.

1545
01:21:40,333 --> 01:21:43,168
Does it look as
you remembered it?

1546
01:21:44,604 --> 01:21:48,941
- Oh, uh, at first I thought so,
but now I'm not so sure!

1547
01:21:48,942 --> 01:21:51,810
<i>- Four months ago,
the tree that was standing here</i>

1548
01:21:51,811 --> 01:21:54,013
<i>was struck and killed
by lightening.</i>

1549
01:21:54,014 --> 01:21:57,116
The young man who replaced
the tree comes here quite a lot.

1550
01:21:58,118 --> 01:21:59,785
We've spoken once or twice.

1551
01:21:59,786 --> 01:22:01,920
- You can traumatize
the roots. I read it.

1552
01:22:01,921 --> 01:22:04,356
- What are you,
Martha Stewart?

1553
01:22:04,357 --> 01:22:06,792
<i>- He tells me
it's very important</i>

1554
01:22:06,793 --> 01:22:08,427
that there be a tree here.

1555
01:22:09,729 --> 01:22:12,231
Do you suppose he's the one

1556
01:22:12,232 --> 01:22:15,334
<i>with whom you buried
the letters?</i>

1557
01:22:17,237 --> 01:22:19,271
- Yeah.

1558
01:22:19,272 --> 01:22:20,806
- He's very nice.

1559
01:22:20,807 --> 01:22:23,142
Very strong in his way.

1560
01:22:24,644 --> 01:22:26,645
- Yeah, he is.

1561
01:22:26,646 --> 01:22:29,381
- Now, does the fact
that you've come here today

1562
01:22:29,382 --> 01:22:30,749
mean that you're healed?

1563
01:22:32,018 --> 01:22:34,720
Yeah, I read your letters.

1564
01:22:34,721 --> 01:22:37,389
I'm sorry.
It's very wrong of me,

1565
01:22:37,390 --> 01:22:41,794
but it gets very boring just
coming, sitting here sketching.

1566
01:22:41,795 --> 01:22:43,629
Besides, I told you,

1567
01:22:43,630 --> 01:22:46,265
old people just do
what they want.

1568
01:22:47,701 --> 01:22:49,335
- It's OK.

1569
01:22:50,470 --> 01:22:54,473
- So... are you ready
to be with him now?

1570
01:22:54,474 --> 01:22:57,443
- Well, I wouldn't have
come if I wasn't ready.

1571
01:22:57,444 --> 01:22:58,844
- Great.

1572
01:22:58,845 --> 01:23:00,913
That's wonderful.

1573
01:23:00,914 --> 01:23:04,016
Come on, I want you to
read the letter and call him.

1574
01:23:04,017 --> 01:23:05,084
I'll help you dig.

1575
01:23:05,085 --> 01:23:06,085
- Uh...

1576
01:23:06,086 --> 01:23:07,119
- What?

1577
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:08,854
- Well, I'll read his letter,

1578
01:23:08,855 --> 01:23:10,456
but I'm not gonna call him.

1579
01:23:10,457 --> 01:23:13,525
- What are you nuts?
After all you've been through?

1580
01:23:13,526 --> 01:23:14,693
- If it was meant to be,

1581
01:23:14,694 --> 01:23:16,428
I would've been healed
by yesterday.

1582
01:23:16,429 --> 01:23:19,698
- What kind of nonsense is that?
Yesterday was one day ago.

1583
01:23:19,699 --> 01:23:21,467
Your healing was
off by one day?

1584
01:23:21,468 --> 01:23:24,236
- One very important day.

1585
01:23:25,372 --> 01:23:27,172
Destiny has spoken.

1586
01:23:28,541 --> 01:23:29,908
And to search for him,

1587
01:23:29,909 --> 01:23:32,778
would be like trying to
shape and mould destiny

1588
01:23:32,779 --> 01:23:34,947
and that just can't
be a good idea.

1589
01:23:36,483 --> 01:23:41,153
- Just suppose that the
shaping and moulding of destiny

1590
01:23:41,154 --> 01:23:43,822
is in fact your destiny.

1591
01:23:46,326 --> 01:23:49,862
- Ha! I never thought
about it like that.

1592
01:23:49,863 --> 01:23:53,632
- I'll tell you what destiny
means if you really wanna know.

1593
01:23:53,633 --> 01:23:56,669
That's the least I can do
for you letting me stare.

1594
01:23:59,673 --> 01:24:01,006
- What does it mean?

1595
01:24:02,909 --> 01:24:05,811
- Destiny is the bridge
you build

1596
01:24:05,812 --> 01:24:08,147
to the one you love.

1597
01:24:11,551 --> 01:24:14,720
- Yeah, but if it's meant to be,
it's meant to be, right?

1598
01:24:14,721 --> 01:24:16,689
- Aw!

1599
01:24:16,690 --> 01:24:19,658
I've been hearing people
say that to me for 78 years,

1600
01:24:19,659 --> 01:24:22,227
and I gotta tell you,
it really pisses me off!

1601
01:24:22,228 --> 01:24:25,130
OK, I'll leave you
to your letter.

1602
01:24:25,131 --> 01:24:28,167
It's not polite
for me to stay.

1603
01:24:28,168 --> 01:24:30,769
Besides, you're going to cry.

1604
01:24:32,372 --> 01:24:33,739
It's very moving.

1605
01:24:33,740 --> 01:24:36,675
He must've written
many drafts.

1606
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:43,248
I wish you a story
with a happy ending...

1607
01:24:45,585 --> 01:24:49,054
and the wisdom to look for it.

1608
01:24:50,090 --> 01:24:52,391
- Thank you.

1609
01:24:57,597 --> 01:24:59,198
<i>- I got the job.</i>

1610
01:24:59,199 --> 01:25:01,867
<i>- That's fantastic, Charlie!
- That's unbelievable!</i>

1611
01:25:01,868 --> 01:25:04,136
- Yeah, you have no idea.

1612
01:25:04,137 --> 01:25:05,771
Um, here's the thing.

1613
01:25:05,772 --> 01:25:07,639
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh?

1614
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:09,775
- I don't wanna work for
Tiller King.

1615
01:25:09,776 --> 01:25:11,744
- Why not?

1616
01:25:11,745 --> 01:25:14,079
- I-I'm sorry.
I ju- I don't.

1617
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:15,280
- Well, wha-

1618
01:25:15,281 --> 01:25:17,516
What are you
gonna do then?

1619
01:25:19,152 --> 01:25:21,286
- I'm gonna live.

1620
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:42,608
<i>Dear Jordan,</i>

1621
01:25:42,609 --> 01:25:43,942
<i>This is the story</i>

1622
01:25:43,943 --> 01:25:46,412
<i>of the first and last time
I ever fell in love.</i>

1623
01:25:46,413 --> 01:25:50,649
<i>And of the beautiful,
complicated, fascinating woman</i>

1624
01:25:50,650 --> 01:25:54,319
<i>who inhabits my soul.</i>

1625
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:56,889
<i>I'm pretty sure
you're gonna leave me tomorrow,</i>

1626
01:25:56,890 --> 01:26:00,125
<i>so I better say this
while I have the chance.</i>

1627
01:26:05,432 --> 01:26:08,634
Whether we're together or apart,

1628
01:26:08,635 --> 01:26:12,771
<i>You will always be
the woman of my life.</i>

1629
01:26:14,307 --> 01:26:18,777
The only man I will ever envy
is the man who wins your heart,

1630
01:26:18,778 --> 01:26:22,781
and I will always believe it was
my destiny to be that man.

1631
01:26:24,918 --> 01:26:27,052
<i>If we never
see each other again,</i>

1632
01:26:27,053 --> 01:26:28,987
and you're out walking one day

1633
01:26:28,988 --> 01:26:32,891
<i>and you feel
a certain presence beside you...</i>

1634
01:26:50,210 --> 01:26:52,745
<i>that will be me...</i>

1635
01:26:52,746 --> 01:26:56,181
<i>loving you...</i>

1636
01:26:56,182 --> 01:26:58,384
<i>wherever I am.</i>

1637
01:27:03,023 --> 01:27:05,991
- I mean, should I
just forget about her?

1638
01:27:05,992 --> 01:27:07,860
I should forget about her.

1639
01:27:07,861 --> 01:27:10,729
Because, realistically,
it's- I mean...

1640
01:27:10,730 --> 01:27:14,199
Realistically, could we
ever really be together

1641
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:16,101
is the question, you know?

1642
01:27:16,102 --> 01:27:20,105
And where is the line between
romantic and delusional?

1643
01:27:20,106 --> 01:27:21,807
And how-how do you know

1644
01:27:21,808 --> 01:27:24,643
once you've crossed
said line, you know?

1645
01:27:24,644 --> 01:27:29,682
Do we live in the physical
world that we can touch,

1646
01:27:29,683 --> 01:27:34,420
or do we live in the world
we create in our minds?

1647
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:42,561
You should be a business major.

1648
01:27:52,405 --> 01:27:55,107
Excuse me, I said sparkling.

1649
01:27:55,108 --> 01:27:57,643
- Oh, there she is!

1650
01:28:02,582 --> 01:28:04,850
Oh, you've gotten
even more beautiful.

1651
01:28:04,851 --> 01:28:06,452
- Oh, please!

1652
01:28:06,453 --> 01:28:08,253
You've not aged a day!

1653
01:28:08,254 --> 01:28:09,822
- Oh!

1654
01:28:11,658 --> 01:28:14,093
So, how are you?

1655
01:28:14,094 --> 01:28:15,861
- I'm good.

1656
01:28:22,102 --> 01:28:24,003
Yeah.

1657
01:28:24,004 --> 01:28:26,438
- Somewhere in heaven,
my son is sad.

1658
01:28:26,439 --> 01:28:28,474
- No. No, no, no.
He's not.

1659
01:28:29,509 --> 01:28:31,610
- Oh.

1660
01:28:31,611 --> 01:28:33,712
No, you're right.

1661
01:28:35,215 --> 01:28:36,915
He's happy for you.

1662
01:28:40,587 --> 01:28:42,721
I'm happy for you.

1663
01:28:44,190 --> 01:28:45,791
- Thank you.

1664
01:28:52,198 --> 01:28:55,067
- So, shall I tell
you about this boy?

1665
01:28:55,068 --> 01:28:56,301
- Oh-

1666
01:28:56,302 --> 01:28:58,404
- He's the one I wanted
to introduce you to

1667
01:28:58,405 --> 01:29:00,973
a year and a half ago,
but neither of you showed up.

1668
01:29:00,974 --> 01:29:02,408
He's a business student.

1669
01:29:02,409 --> 01:29:03,742
- Aunt Sally!

1670
01:29:03,743 --> 01:29:05,844
- He's very, very smart.

1671
01:29:05,845 --> 01:29:07,813
So handsome.

1672
01:29:17,290 --> 01:29:19,224
Jordan.

1673
01:29:19,225 --> 01:29:21,093
This is Charlie.

1674
01:29:22,796 --> 01:29:24,430
- Oh...

1675
01:29:39,879 --> 01:29:41,847
- I'm- I'm sorry.
Am I-

1676
01:29:41,848 --> 01:29:43,982
Do you two know each other?

1677
01:29:43,983 --> 01:29:46,085
<i>- And that's how
the story ended.</i>

1678
01:29:46,086 --> 01:29:48,053
Or, in a sense, how it began.

1679
01:29:48,054 --> 01:29:51,123
- I told you I'd meet a man
from the future.

1680
01:29:51,124 --> 01:29:52,958
<i>- Not bad, huh?</i>

1681
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:22,855
<i>And as for the question
of destiny,</i>

1682
01:30:22,856 --> 01:30:26,592
all I know is that even
when destiny really wants

1683
01:30:26,593 --> 01:30:28,460
to accomplish something,

1684
01:30:28,461 --> 01:30:30,062
<i>it can't do it alone.</i>

1685
01:30:30,063 --> 01:30:32,297
<i>You still have to go
to that restaurant.</i>

1686
01:30:32,298 --> 01:30:34,400
You still have to show up.

1687
01:30:34,401 --> 01:30:39,007
You still have to build a
bridge to the one you love.
