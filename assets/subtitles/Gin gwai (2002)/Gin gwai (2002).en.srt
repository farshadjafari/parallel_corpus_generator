1
00:00:35,938 --> 00:00:39,567
<i>Some people say this world is ugly</i>

2
00:00:39,978 --> 00:00:42,731
<i>yet it is beautiful
at the same time.</i>

3
00:00:43,498 --> 00:00:45,614
<i>I don't know if they are right,</i>

4
00:00:46,698 --> 00:00:47,813
<i>but</i>

5
00:00:47,858 --> 00:00:50,975
<i>I'm about to see the world with fresh eyes.</i>

6
00:03:41,818 --> 00:03:45,128
Wong Kar Mun, I'm giving you
a local anesthetic now.

7
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,733
The operation will take about two hours.

8
00:03:47,778 --> 00:03:50,895
Are you ready?

9
00:04:22,218 --> 00:04:24,732
Who's that?

10
00:04:24,778 --> 00:04:27,338
Quiet! We don't want to alarm the nurses.

11
00:04:27,658 --> 00:04:30,092
I am in the bed next to yours.

12
00:04:30,138 --> 00:04:32,857
I heard that you just had an eye operation.

13
00:04:33,098 --> 00:04:35,168
I've had many operations here.

14
00:04:35,338 --> 00:04:38,091
I know the whole hospital.
They are all nice to me.

15
00:04:38,138 --> 00:04:39,776
How old are you?

16
00:04:39,818 --> 00:04:41,934
Why so many operations?

17
00:04:41,978 --> 00:04:45,288
I'm eleven.
I should have been in junior high by now,

18
00:04:45,538 --> 00:04:48,177
but my mother says I have a brain tumor,

19
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:49,897
which affects my nerves...

20
00:04:49,938 --> 00:04:53,374
That's why I pass out all the time.

21
00:04:53,618 --> 00:04:55,529
They have to remove it.

22
00:04:55,578 --> 00:04:57,250
But it's so large and dangerous,

23
00:04:57,298 --> 00:04:59,129
they have to operate many times.

24
00:04:59,178 --> 00:05:02,170
So I skipped school last year
and stayed here ever since.

25
00:05:03,218 --> 00:05:05,937
You're so young, yet so brave!

26
00:05:06,298 --> 00:05:08,334
Once you can see again,

27
00:05:08,538 --> 00:05:09,857
I'll take you out to play.

28
00:05:09,898 --> 00:05:13,607
The world is really beautiful.

29
00:05:21,538 --> 00:05:25,929
Wong Kar Mun, when I remove
the bandages from your eyes,

30
00:05:26,138 --> 00:05:28,288
it might hurt a little at first.

31
00:05:28,338 --> 00:05:30,374
If it hurts too much, let me know.

32
00:05:30,418 --> 00:05:34,377
We can always do it tomorrow.

33
00:05:54,778 --> 00:05:57,417
Now, let's try.

34
00:05:58,138 --> 00:06:02,097
Open your eyes slowly.

35
00:06:29,858 --> 00:06:32,372
Hey, don't force yourself if it hurts.

36
00:06:46,258 --> 00:06:49,694
It hurts!

37
00:06:50,818 --> 00:06:53,127
Is it too painful?

38
00:06:53,178 --> 00:06:55,817
Dr Lo, she must be in a lot of pain!

39
00:06:55,978 --> 00:06:59,368
She hasn't cried out
in pain ever since she was a kid!

40
00:06:59,578 --> 00:07:02,729
Grandma, let the doctor do his job.

41
00:07:04,578 --> 00:07:06,375
Please, don't worry about it.

42
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:08,454
Very few patients experience immediate success.

43
00:07:08,498 --> 00:07:10,136
It takes time...

44
00:07:10,178 --> 00:07:12,738
...for the eye and brain to work together.

45
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:54,006
Ying Ying.

46
00:07:54,058 --> 00:07:57,289
Ying Ying.

47
00:08:01,378 --> 00:08:03,528
Hi, can you see now?

48
00:08:03,698 --> 00:08:06,815
I'm Ying Ying.

49
00:08:11,218 --> 00:08:13,857
Can you really see me?

50
00:08:13,898 --> 00:08:16,970
I think I can see.
I'm not sure.

51
00:08:17,138 --> 00:08:19,129
Great!
You can see!

52
00:08:19,178 --> 00:08:21,533
Nurse, she can see!

53
00:08:22,098 --> 00:08:24,214
Nurse,

54
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:25,527
her eyes are working!

55
00:08:25,578 --> 00:08:28,217
She sees me!
Come quick!

56
00:08:56,138 --> 00:08:57,571
Grandma!

57
00:08:57,618 --> 00:08:58,687
The hospital called!

58
00:08:58,738 --> 00:08:59,693
What?

59
00:08:59,738 --> 00:09:00,853
Mun can see!

60
00:09:00,898 --> 00:09:01,535
Really?

61
00:09:01,578 --> 00:09:05,253
Let's go to the hospital now!

62
00:09:05,298 --> 00:09:08,017
Are you going to discharge me now?

63
00:09:08,058 --> 00:09:09,286
Not so soon.

64
00:09:09,338 --> 00:09:11,408
Every cornea recipient starts off near-sighted...

65
00:09:11,658 --> 00:09:13,694
by a level of as much as one thousand degrees.

66
00:09:13,738 --> 00:09:16,298
Only when your eye muscles are able to adapt,

67
00:09:16,538 --> 00:09:19,496
will this falls to about two hundred degrees.

68
00:09:19,658 --> 00:09:21,774
When will she have perfect eyesight then?

69
00:09:22,018 --> 00:09:23,292
No one has perfect eyesight.

70
00:09:23,338 --> 00:09:25,329
Most people are near-sighted
by about one hundred degrees.

71
00:09:25,578 --> 00:09:27,296
Does that mean...

72
00:09:27,338 --> 00:09:29,135
...she will need to wear glasses?

73
00:09:29,178 --> 00:09:30,327
That won't be necessary.

74
00:09:30,378 --> 00:09:33,575
All she needs for the moment
is a pair of sunglasses.

75
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,528
Mun, get some rest.

76
00:09:36,578 --> 00:09:38,614
If everything goes well,
you can be released early.

77
00:09:45,698 --> 00:09:47,734
You can take off your sunglasses now.

78
00:09:48,018 --> 00:09:50,134
Try to get used to the light gradually.

79
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:52,332
If you feel pain,

80
00:09:52,378 --> 00:09:54,175
or if your eyes start watering,

81
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,527
then you should close your eyes,

82
00:09:56,738 --> 00:09:58,057
and let them rest.

83
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,531
Here, I'll help you onto bed.

84
00:09:59,578 --> 00:10:00,772
Nurse?

85
00:10:00,818 --> 00:10:02,968
Is there a mirror in every washroom?

86
00:10:03,338 --> 00:10:06,250
I'll take you there.

87
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:22,495
Here.

88
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:25,735
Slowly.

89
00:10:26,218 --> 00:10:28,812
Take your time and call me if you need anything.

90
00:12:00,018 --> 00:12:03,169
Who's that?

91
00:12:06,138 --> 00:12:09,255
Ying Ying, is that you?

92
00:12:09,298 --> 00:12:11,732
Why are you so quiet?

93
00:12:11,778 --> 00:12:15,214
I'm having another operation tomorrow.

94
00:12:15,538 --> 00:12:16,732
You promised to take me out once I can see.

95
00:12:19,658 --> 00:12:21,091
We'll go out and have fun...

96
00:12:21,138 --> 00:12:23,129
...after your operation.

97
00:12:23,178 --> 00:12:25,373
Did they say you can leave the hospital already?

98
00:12:25,418 --> 00:12:26,897
Not yet!

99
00:12:26,938 --> 00:12:29,577
But even if I do,
I can always drop by for a visit.

100
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:33,891
Let's take a picture together.

101
00:12:34,138 --> 00:12:35,856
- Let's do it outside!
- Alright.

102
00:12:35,898 --> 00:12:38,128
- Let's go...
- But where?

103
00:12:39,298 --> 00:12:41,528
Let's go that way!

104
00:12:41,698 --> 00:12:42,608
What's this?

105
00:12:42,658 --> 00:12:43,568
A camera.

106
00:12:43,618 --> 00:12:44,892
Camera?

107
00:12:44,938 --> 00:12:46,894
Now, look this way.

108
00:12:46,938 --> 00:12:47,927
Okay.

109
00:12:47,978 --> 00:12:51,050
Ready...one...two...three!

110
00:14:57,418 --> 00:15:00,137
Madam, are you alright?

111
00:15:44,898 --> 00:15:47,048
Hello...

112
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:02,289
<i>I'm freezing...</i>

113
00:16:35,498 --> 00:16:37,568
Send this one to Block C.

114
00:16:37,618 --> 00:16:41,531
We have a full-house in Block B.

115
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,371
Nurse...

116
00:17:06,418 --> 00:17:08,568
did the old lady pass away?

117
00:17:10,098 --> 00:17:11,895
Yes, we've taken her away.

118
00:17:11,938 --> 00:17:13,690
But last night...

119
00:17:13,738 --> 00:17:15,933
I saw someone drop by to visit her.

120
00:17:16,138 --> 00:17:18,413
They even went out together.

121
00:17:19,578 --> 00:17:21,057
Are you sure?

122
00:17:21,098 --> 00:17:24,977
We don't allow any visitors here at night.

123
00:17:29,858 --> 00:17:31,337
Where's Ying Ying?

124
00:17:31,378 --> 00:17:33,846
She went for an operation this morning.

125
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,176
Dr. Lo preferred that

126
00:17:52,218 --> 00:17:54,254
you stay for two more days...

127
00:17:54,298 --> 00:17:56,607
but because I'll be away on flight
duty for two weeks,

128
00:17:56,818 --> 00:17:58,888
no one will be able to pick you up then.

129
00:17:59,658 --> 00:18:01,376
It was easier to have you discharged now.

130
00:18:01,418 --> 00:18:02,612
This way,

131
00:18:02,658 --> 00:18:05,934
you and grandma can spend more time together.

132
00:18:06,498 --> 00:18:08,295
My... it's already three p.m.!

133
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:11,216
Hope this place is easy to find,

134
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:31,573
...hope we won't be too late.

135
00:18:34,778 --> 00:18:38,657
We're only ten minutes late for our appointment.

136
00:18:38,938 --> 00:18:42,010
I have to leave for work soon.

137
00:18:42,178 --> 00:18:44,328
I'm sorry.

138
00:18:44,378 --> 00:18:45,697
Dr. Lo just stepped out for a few minutes.

139
00:18:45,738 --> 00:18:46,614
Okay.

140
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:47,613
There he is.

141
00:18:47,658 --> 00:18:48,932
Is my three o'clock here?

142
00:18:48,978 --> 00:18:50,536
Yes, they are.

143
00:18:50,578 --> 00:18:53,854
Mun, let's go.

144
00:18:54,578 --> 00:18:56,728
Let me introduce you to the nature of my work.

145
00:18:57,378 --> 00:18:59,130
From now on,

146
00:18:59,178 --> 00:19:01,646
I am Ms Wong Kar Mun's psychotherapist.

147
00:19:02,338 --> 00:19:05,171
Since Ms Wong lost her sight at the age of two,

148
00:19:05,498 --> 00:19:07,807
her visual vocabulary

149
00:19:08,058 --> 00:19:09,491
is extremely limited,

150
00:19:09,538 --> 00:19:12,098
and she has probably forgotten most of that.

151
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,137
Lets' see.

152
00:19:14,178 --> 00:19:16,169
Ms Wong, could you please remove your glasses?

153
00:19:16,418 --> 00:19:18,693
And let your eyes get used to the light.

154
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:29,052
Can you tell me what's in my hand?

155
00:19:36,298 --> 00:19:37,970
You'll recognize that it's a stapler...

156
00:19:38,018 --> 00:19:39,576
...once you touch it.

157
00:19:39,618 --> 00:19:41,734
Because all your previous knowledge of objects

158
00:19:41,938 --> 00:19:43,974
was based on touch, not on sight.

159
00:19:44,258 --> 00:19:46,488
Now you are no longer blind.

160
00:19:46,738 --> 00:19:48,012
My job is

161
00:19:48,058 --> 00:19:49,173
help you re-establish

162
00:19:49,218 --> 00:19:50,412
how to use your eyes and...

163
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,369
understand what you see.

164
00:19:52,418 --> 00:19:54,693
Actually, I'm not too worried about that aspect.

165
00:19:54,738 --> 00:19:57,047
What concerns me is your psychological state.

166
00:19:57,658 --> 00:20:00,126
After regaining sight,

167
00:20:00,338 --> 00:20:02,374
many patients end up
feeling alienated and fearful.

168
00:20:02,418 --> 00:20:03,328
Dr. Lo,

169
00:20:03,378 --> 00:20:05,687
is the other doctor Lo a relative of yours?

170
00:20:06,098 --> 00:20:07,611
You mean Dr C.T. Lo?

171
00:20:07,658 --> 00:20:09,853
Yes, he's my uncle.

172
00:20:10,898 --> 00:20:13,856
So... what time do you finish work today?

173
00:20:17,058 --> 00:20:19,697
Ms Wong is my last patient for the day.

174
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:22,930
Well... you see, I need to catch my flight.

175
00:20:23,218 --> 00:20:26,176
Can I trouble you to send Mun home after this?

176
00:20:27,858 --> 00:20:29,496
I see, of course.

177
00:20:29,538 --> 00:20:31,051
After all, starting from today...

178
00:20:31,098 --> 00:20:33,134
I need to take Ms Wong outdoors
for her training anyway.

179
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:34,128
All right.

180
00:20:34,178 --> 00:20:36,294
You can go ahead.

181
00:20:36,538 --> 00:20:37,971
I'm fine by myself.

182
00:20:38,018 --> 00:20:41,727
I'm used to it.

183
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:52,530
That's you as a little girl.

184
00:20:52,778 --> 00:20:55,338
Your father filmed this
a long time ago...

185
00:20:55,618 --> 00:20:59,293
so that you could see it if your eyes ever healed.

186
00:20:59,978 --> 00:21:03,368
He stopped filming after he divorced your mother.

187
00:21:03,418 --> 00:21:05,807
That was seven or eight years ago.

188
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:07,457
Grandma...

189
00:21:07,498 --> 00:21:08,851
Is it true when Dad comes back,

190
00:21:08,898 --> 00:21:11,093
he'll take us to Vancouver?

191
00:21:11,138 --> 00:21:13,368
I know you don't want to go,

192
00:21:13,578 --> 00:21:17,173
but life in Vancouver moves at a slower pace.

193
00:21:17,378 --> 00:21:19,255
It will be better for you.

194
00:21:19,298 --> 00:21:21,937
I can't even read Chinese !
How will I learn English?

195
00:21:22,738 --> 00:21:24,217
Grandma,

196
00:21:24,258 --> 00:21:26,249
I don't want to rely on others forever.

197
00:21:26,298 --> 00:21:27,936
I want to learn to write,

198
00:21:27,978 --> 00:21:29,889
and find a job in Hong Kong.

199
00:21:29,938 --> 00:21:31,451
I want to be independent.

200
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:35,173
Your father would worry about your going to work.

201
00:21:36,498 --> 00:21:39,376
I have to do the dishes.
I'll leave you to watch this alone.

202
00:22:25,258 --> 00:22:26,691
Can I help you?

203
00:22:26,738 --> 00:22:30,253
Have you seen my report card?

204
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:32,096
No.

205
00:22:32,138 --> 00:22:33,491
Do you live around here?

206
00:22:33,538 --> 00:22:36,416
Mun, who's that?

207
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:38,289
It's a little boy, Grandma.

208
00:22:38,338 --> 00:22:40,693
Did a report card ever turn up on our balcony?

209
00:22:43,898 --> 00:22:45,695
That kid is teasing you.

210
00:22:45,738 --> 00:22:48,855
Just ignore him.

211
00:24:08,018 --> 00:24:10,532
Kid, what are you eating?

212
00:24:12,098 --> 00:24:15,613
I'm very hungry.

213
00:24:18,858 --> 00:24:21,088
What's your problem?

214
00:25:17,538 --> 00:25:20,371
Everyone !
We have two pieces of good news today.

215
00:25:20,618 --> 00:25:23,416
First...

216
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:28,691
Ms Tone Deaf had a successful operation!

217
00:25:32,218 --> 00:25:35,608
And second, for our Christmas charity concert...

218
00:25:35,778 --> 00:25:39,532
We'll be performing with Vanessa Mae!

219
00:26:07,698 --> 00:26:10,974
Mr. Cheng, why haven't I received
the practice schedule?

220
00:26:17,258 --> 00:26:18,930
Mun, you know, after all...

221
00:26:18,978 --> 00:26:21,094
we're an organization for the blind.

222
00:26:21,138 --> 00:26:23,732
You're always welcome to come to practice...

223
00:26:23,938 --> 00:26:26,611
but perhaps you should do something
else for the performance,

224
00:26:26,858 --> 00:26:27,847
such as coordination,

225
00:26:27,898 --> 00:26:29,331
or taking care of our members.

226
00:26:29,378 --> 00:26:30,652
I can even arrange for you

227
00:26:30,698 --> 00:26:32,973
to help out at the Centre.

228
00:26:33,498 --> 00:26:35,216
Mr. Cheng,

229
00:26:35,258 --> 00:26:37,488
I really want to take part in this performance.

230
00:26:37,938 --> 00:26:39,053
I've practiced so long

231
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:41,487
for this concert!

232
00:26:41,538 --> 00:26:45,008
I understand, but...

233
00:26:46,858 --> 00:26:48,291
Excuse me, Mr. Cheng...

234
00:26:48,338 --> 00:26:49,737
Vanessa Mae's agent

235
00:26:49,778 --> 00:26:52,167
wants us to fax over her schedule.

236
00:26:52,378 --> 00:26:54,573
I'll be with you right away.

237
00:26:54,618 --> 00:26:56,927
Mun?
Mun?

238
00:26:57,778 --> 00:27:01,657
Let's discuss this again.
I have to go.

239
00:28:27,258 --> 00:28:27,849
Grandma!

240
00:28:27,898 --> 00:28:28,728
Are you leaving?

241
00:28:28,778 --> 00:28:30,006
Yes, to class.

242
00:28:30,058 --> 00:28:31,457
Come back early for dinner.

243
00:28:31,498 --> 00:28:33,250
I've prepared some special turnip soup.

244
00:28:33,298 --> 00:28:36,290
Bye!

245
00:28:36,498 --> 00:28:40,332
Have you seen my report card?

246
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:43,894
Didn't you find it yet?

247
00:28:44,578 --> 00:28:48,127
<i>I really haven't seen it.</i>

248
00:28:50,378 --> 00:28:52,846
<i>Perhaps you should ask someone else.</i>

249
00:29:12,338 --> 00:29:15,375
Ying Ying!

250
00:29:15,898 --> 00:29:18,458
Excuse me, I'd like to talk to her.

251
00:29:18,498 --> 00:29:20,614
Look what I've brought for you.

252
00:29:22,418 --> 00:29:25,569
Mun, I've just had chemo-therapy,

253
00:29:25,778 --> 00:29:29,373
I'll throw up if I eat.

254
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:33,367
It's okay.

255
00:29:33,578 --> 00:29:37,366
Then we'll save it for when you get better.

256
00:30:04,178 --> 00:30:06,373
If only we had believed him just that once,

257
00:30:07,218 --> 00:30:09,413
or given him a chance to explain,

258
00:30:10,578 --> 00:30:12,887
he might still be here playing video games.

259
00:30:14,058 --> 00:30:16,447
Who would have expected
him to jump off just like that?

260
00:30:19,258 --> 00:30:22,534
Suicide is a dreadful sin.

261
00:30:24,618 --> 00:30:26,210
The souls of those who commit suicide...

262
00:30:26,258 --> 00:30:29,056
are obliged to repeat their
painful deaths everyday.

263
00:30:30,458 --> 00:30:33,848
To help him break out of this
vicious cycle of pain,

264
00:30:34,138 --> 00:30:37,767
we need to tackle the cause of his suicide.

265
00:30:37,978 --> 00:30:40,333
Only then can his soul leave this world in peace.

266
00:30:43,578 --> 00:30:44,852
Have you ever considered

267
00:30:44,898 --> 00:30:46,968
he might be telling the truth?

268
00:30:47,018 --> 00:30:49,532
Perhaps he really did lose his report card.

269
00:32:52,418 --> 00:32:54,852
Have you been teaching
calligraphy long?

270
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,816
Yes, many years indeed.

271
00:32:56,858 --> 00:33:00,737
I'll teach you how to hold the brush.

272
00:33:02,458 --> 00:33:04,608
Use your thumb and middle finger,

273
00:33:04,658 --> 00:33:06,535
and form a circle just like this...

274
00:33:06,578 --> 00:33:11,811
Like this, try.

275
00:33:12,338 --> 00:33:16,013
Very few want to learn calligraphy nowadays.

276
00:33:16,418 --> 00:33:21,208
I used to teach three lessons a week.

277
00:33:21,538 --> 00:33:25,895
Now, it's down to only one.

278
00:33:26,618 --> 00:33:31,055
I'll let you try writing by yourself.

279
00:33:31,298 --> 00:33:34,927
Try it yourself.

280
00:33:57,338 --> 00:33:59,374
<i>Why are you sitting in my chair?</i>

281
00:34:30,338 --> 00:34:32,852
<i><b>Why are you sitting in my chair?!</b></i>

282
00:34:41,298 --> 00:34:44,415
What is this?
What is going on?

283
00:34:47,178 --> 00:34:49,772
What are you looking for?
Are you okay?

284
00:34:54,818 --> 00:34:57,571
<i>What happened?</i>

285
00:34:57,818 --> 00:35:00,173
<i>Are you feeling unwell?</i>

286
00:35:03,698 --> 00:35:05,211
Is Dr. Lo here?

287
00:35:05,258 --> 00:35:07,374
Ms. Wong, you are early.

288
00:35:07,618 --> 00:35:10,815
Your next appointment isn't until Friday.

289
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:13,088
He won't be back from his meeting until five p.m.

290
00:35:15,178 --> 00:35:17,214
Will he definitely be here at five p.m.?

291
00:35:17,658 --> 00:35:19,250
If it's urgent,

292
00:35:19,298 --> 00:35:22,495
I can page him for you now.

293
00:35:22,658 --> 00:35:26,253
I'll be back at five.

294
00:37:24,658 --> 00:37:27,968
You can see them, too?

295
00:37:28,018 --> 00:37:30,578
They don't usually want to be seen.

296
00:37:30,938 --> 00:37:34,328
But you'll get used to it.

297
00:37:34,378 --> 00:37:36,733
All the stores nearby have been bought up,

298
00:37:37,418 --> 00:37:39,409
only my boss refuses to sell.

299
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:43,167
He seems to be expecting
his wife and child to visit.

300
00:37:43,338 --> 00:37:45,488
Actually, he can't see them at all.

301
00:38:31,658 --> 00:38:35,173
There was a car accident
over there...

302
00:39:19,138 --> 00:39:21,777
Mun!

303
00:39:21,818 --> 00:39:23,809
My secretary said you were asking for me.

304
00:39:23,978 --> 00:39:27,015
What's the matter?

305
00:39:40,058 --> 00:39:42,333
Will you help me?

306
00:39:42,378 --> 00:39:44,573
Of course I will.

307
00:39:45,058 --> 00:39:48,414
Your eyes hurt?

308
00:39:49,298 --> 00:39:51,209
Will you believe me?

309
00:39:51,258 --> 00:39:53,567
Yes...

310
00:39:53,618 --> 00:39:55,848
What is it?

311
00:39:55,898 --> 00:39:59,937
The shadows... they come to bring death.

312
00:40:01,338 --> 00:40:04,569
What shadows?

313
00:40:06,298 --> 00:40:08,812
When I was at the hospital...

314
00:40:09,858 --> 00:40:12,053
I saw a man.

315
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:17,288
He... he took an old lady with him.

316
00:40:17,898 --> 00:40:21,334
The next morning, the old lady was dead...

317
00:40:22,818 --> 00:40:26,891
My room keeps changing
suddenly into a different room...

318
00:40:28,338 --> 00:40:31,171
I even saw a person missing her lower body...

319
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:44,053
When he rushed over,
it was like an electric shock.

320
00:40:45,298 --> 00:40:48,017
My whole body went numb...

321
00:40:56,818 --> 00:40:58,376
Calm down.

322
00:40:58,418 --> 00:41:01,854
And tell me slowly.

323
00:41:09,018 --> 00:41:12,294
When I was little,

324
00:41:12,338 --> 00:41:15,375
Granny told me...

325
00:41:15,418 --> 00:41:18,012
I was not an ordinary child.

326
00:41:19,058 --> 00:41:21,572
God had given me some obstacles...

327
00:41:22,138 --> 00:41:26,336
so that I would grow up
to be an extraordinary person.

328
00:41:29,378 --> 00:41:31,573
Now I understand

329
00:41:31,618 --> 00:41:34,530
what it means to be extraordinary.

330
00:41:34,578 --> 00:41:36,250
An extraordinary person

331
00:41:36,298 --> 00:41:38,368
can see things others can't...

332
00:41:39,818 --> 00:41:42,252
and feel pain that others won't feel.

333
00:41:46,898 --> 00:41:50,971
Maybe, I was never meant to see this world.

334
00:41:53,498 --> 00:41:56,012
I don't want to lie terrified
in bed every night...

335
00:41:59,858 --> 00:42:01,974
then awaken to horrors every morning.

336
00:42:05,098 --> 00:42:08,010
I just want to be an ordinary person.

337
00:42:09,458 --> 00:42:12,291
Dr. Lo, can you help me?

338
00:42:15,258 --> 00:42:17,374
Yes, of course I will.

339
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:24,693
One of my psychology professors...

340
00:42:24,738 --> 00:42:25,693
from the States...

341
00:42:25,738 --> 00:42:27,091
has just come to Hong Kong to visit.

342
00:42:27,138 --> 00:42:29,254
Let's meet him tomorrow.

343
00:42:29,298 --> 00:42:32,973
He might be able to help.

344
00:42:47,578 --> 00:42:51,207
How can you help me when you don't believe me?

345
00:43:24,858 --> 00:43:26,928
What's going on?

346
00:43:26,978 --> 00:43:29,094
Excuse me, I have to go.

347
00:43:29,298 --> 00:43:30,617
Call me if you need anything.

348
00:43:30,658 --> 00:43:33,411
Goodbye.

349
00:43:33,458 --> 00:43:34,686
Who's that?

350
00:43:34,738 --> 00:43:36,012
A friend.

351
00:43:36,058 --> 00:43:39,095
He asked your sister to take
something to the States.

352
00:43:39,258 --> 00:43:40,930
Yes, that's right.

353
00:43:40,978 --> 00:43:42,775
You are home early.

354
00:43:42,818 --> 00:43:44,649
Aren't you supposed to be back next week?

355
00:43:44,698 --> 00:43:46,575
Well...

356
00:43:46,618 --> 00:43:47,687
a co-worker switched her shift with mine.

357
00:43:47,738 --> 00:43:48,648
So I come back a bit earlier.

358
00:43:48,698 --> 00:43:50,177
It's smoky here.

359
00:43:50,218 --> 00:43:53,608
Why don't you go up?

360
00:47:36,258 --> 00:47:39,455
14TH FLOOR, UNIT-C.

361
00:47:49,058 --> 00:47:51,492
<i>Have you seen my report card?</i>

362
00:47:51,698 --> 00:47:53,768
Stop asking me?! I've already
told you I haven't seen it!

363
00:47:53,938 --> 00:47:57,613
<i>Have you seen my report card?</i>

364
00:48:09,938 --> 00:48:12,771
15TH FLOOR, UNIT-C.

365
00:50:21,058 --> 00:50:23,094
<i>Uncle, listen to me...</i>

366
00:50:23,978 --> 00:50:24,933
<i>No way!</i>

367
00:50:24,978 --> 00:50:27,048
<i>Only you can help us with this!</i>

368
00:50:27,098 --> 00:50:29,771
<i>I've already said no!</i>

369
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:31,649
<i>If you still respect
me as your uncle,</i>

370
00:50:31,698 --> 00:50:33,370
<i>and respect yourself as my nephew,</i>

371
00:50:33,418 --> 00:50:35,613
<i>you should have never approached
me with this!</i>

372
00:50:37,618 --> 00:50:38,812
First of all,

373
00:50:38,858 --> 00:50:40,450
you should know only too well...

374
00:50:40,498 --> 00:50:42,773
what medical ethics are,
regarding organ transplant.

375
00:50:42,818 --> 00:50:45,286
And you should also know that...

376
00:50:45,538 --> 00:50:46,766
the identity of the cornea donor

377
00:50:46,818 --> 00:50:48,695
is concealed from me.

378
00:50:48,738 --> 00:50:50,171
What shadows?

379
00:50:50,218 --> 00:50:52,288
One cornea transplant
and she starts seeing ghosts?

380
00:50:52,338 --> 00:50:55,489
You actually believe that?

381
00:50:56,698 --> 00:50:58,051
What if I do?

382
00:50:58,098 --> 00:51:01,408
Then we have even less to talk about!

383
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:03,688
Uncle...

384
00:51:03,738 --> 00:51:06,457
Don't tell me you fell for your own patient.

385
00:51:16,898 --> 00:51:17,933
Hello?

386
00:51:17,978 --> 00:51:20,094
<i>Dr. Lo, is that you?</i>

387
00:51:20,338 --> 00:51:21,896
<i>Mun is in trouble!</i>

388
00:51:21,938 --> 00:51:25,135
<i>Can you come over immediately?</i>

389
00:51:25,178 --> 00:51:28,693
Yes, right away.

390
00:51:32,218 --> 00:51:34,368
Yes, I admit.

391
00:51:34,618 --> 00:51:38,054
She's more than a patient to me.

392
00:51:47,258 --> 00:51:49,772
Mun!

393
00:51:59,138 --> 00:52:01,208
How long do you plan
on hiding in this little room?

394
00:52:01,538 --> 00:52:03,608
Five years? Seven? Or ten?

395
00:52:04,458 --> 00:52:08,292
You have to confront your problem sooner or later.

396
00:52:09,018 --> 00:52:12,169
You want to play violin?
Go play with the troupe!

397
00:52:14,418 --> 00:52:17,012
I can understand your pretending to be blind.

398
00:52:17,058 --> 00:52:17,934
But even then...

399
00:52:17,978 --> 00:52:20,014
don't isolate yourself here.

400
00:52:26,578 --> 00:52:30,093
I just want to help.

401
00:54:38,258 --> 00:54:42,012
Mun!

402
00:55:00,738 --> 00:55:04,014
Mun.

403
00:55:12,618 --> 00:55:15,815
Ying Ying, what are you doing here?

404
00:55:16,458 --> 00:55:19,336
I can leave the hospital now.

405
00:55:21,618 --> 00:55:23,813
You can?

406
00:55:23,858 --> 00:55:26,531
Yes, I don't need any more operations.

407
00:55:26,778 --> 00:55:28,814
I can go to school now.

408
00:55:28,858 --> 00:55:31,816
So...

409
00:55:31,858 --> 00:55:34,418
Then once I am out of here,

410
00:55:36,258 --> 00:55:39,967
we can go out...

411
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:43,211
we can take pictures, we can even...

412
00:55:49,298 --> 00:55:51,937
I'm so happy that you can see now,

413
00:55:58,098 --> 00:56:00,612
because this world is really beautiful.

414
00:56:07,778 --> 00:56:09,928
Ying Ying...

415
00:56:10,258 --> 00:56:13,056
It's alright! Cheer up.

416
00:56:13,258 --> 00:56:15,818
Be strong and things will work out for the best.

417
00:56:21,898 --> 00:56:23,889
I have to go now.

418
00:57:02,698 --> 00:57:04,973
Ying Ying!

419
00:57:42,538 --> 00:57:45,769
Wong Kar Mun, I want to tell you...

420
00:57:47,058 --> 00:57:50,528
Ying Ying has already...

421
00:57:54,098 --> 00:57:57,852
I know... I just saw her.

422
00:57:59,498 --> 00:58:02,058
I know she's dead.

423
00:58:53,698 --> 00:58:56,258
What are you looking at?

424
00:58:56,298 --> 00:58:59,495
Ying Ying.

425
00:59:01,818 --> 00:59:05,128
Can you see her?

426
00:59:11,858 --> 00:59:14,975
It wasn't her.

427
00:59:15,018 --> 00:59:18,931
Don't know why she didn't show up today.

428
00:59:23,138 --> 00:59:26,448
Are you not afraid anymore?

429
00:59:28,858 --> 00:59:31,531
I don't think I have a choice.

430
00:59:31,578 --> 00:59:34,615
I see all these things anyway.

431
00:59:34,658 --> 00:59:37,297
At least, I get to see the people I care about.

432
00:59:50,298 --> 00:59:51,890
What's this?

433
00:59:51,938 --> 00:59:55,772
Ying Ying made this for you.

434
01:00:04,378 --> 01:00:05,697
What's written on it?

435
01:00:05,738 --> 01:00:09,048
"Don't forget me."

436
01:00:14,258 --> 01:00:16,453
She put in the wrong photo though.

437
01:00:16,498 --> 01:00:19,012
Who's this?

438
01:00:19,058 --> 01:00:21,049
It's you!

439
01:00:21,098 --> 01:00:24,977
Don't you recognize yourself yet?

440
01:00:44,178 --> 01:00:46,328
What is going on?

441
01:00:47,138 --> 01:00:50,847
Who are you?

442
01:00:57,538 --> 01:01:01,087
Who the hell are you?!

443
01:01:35,298 --> 01:01:37,766
<i>We believe that the very last
consciousness of a mortal...</i>

444
01:01:38,298 --> 01:01:40,653
<i>carries over to the afterlife.</i>

445
01:01:40,698 --> 01:01:43,496
<i>That the very thought of a person
in his final moment...</i>

446
01:01:43,858 --> 01:01:46,008
<i>would become the eternal
consciousness of his soul.</i>

447
01:01:46,938 --> 01:01:49,088
<i>Those who die a sudden death,</i>

448
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:51,777
<i>have no recollection
of the instance of death.</i>

449
01:01:52,538 --> 01:01:55,974
<i>Their souls remain in this world
as if they're still alive.</i>

450
01:01:56,338 --> 01:01:58,852
<i>But there are others
who intentionally refuse to leave,</i>

451
01:01:59,098 --> 01:02:01,658
<i>mostly due to unresolved
problems during their lifetime.</i>

452
01:02:02,178 --> 01:02:04,612
<i>These souls can't be consoled
while their problems remain.</i>

453
01:02:05,578 --> 01:02:08,968
<i>There is only one way to help them,</i>

454
01:02:09,218 --> 01:02:11,527
<i>and that is to resolve what
they left unsettled.</i>

455
01:02:12,618 --> 01:02:15,735
<i>The woman Ms Wong keeps seeing
after resuming her sight...</i>

456
01:02:15,978 --> 01:02:18,731
<i>we have to resolve her problems
so that she can move on.</i>

457
01:02:38,738 --> 01:02:41,298
I hope I haven't done anything wrong.

458
01:02:41,338 --> 01:02:43,613
Even if it's wrong, it'd be my fault.

459
01:02:44,298 --> 01:02:47,688
And I won't regret it.

460
01:02:48,218 --> 01:02:50,493
Were you reincarnated into
the wrong body?

461
01:02:50,538 --> 01:02:51,448
Why are you so different from...

462
01:02:51,498 --> 01:02:55,093
...the rest of the family?

463
01:02:58,418 --> 01:03:01,569
Be careful.

464
01:03:07,498 --> 01:03:12,253
BANGKOK, THAILAND

465
01:03:20,458 --> 01:03:22,926
<i>Dr. Lo believed you in the end?</i>

466
01:03:22,978 --> 01:03:25,731
<i>Let's just say Dr. Lo is not involved.</i>

467
01:03:26,178 --> 01:03:28,738
<i>He's a professional after all,</i>

468
01:03:28,778 --> 01:03:30,689
<i>you know what I mean?</i>

469
01:03:30,738 --> 01:03:32,171
<i>Yes.</i>

470
01:03:32,218 --> 01:03:34,288
<i>Are we close?</i>

471
01:03:34,338 --> 01:03:35,817
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

472
01:03:35,858 --> 01:03:38,975
<i>It says here that her
Chinese name was Chiu Wai Ling.</i>

473
01:03:39,258 --> 01:03:41,010
<i>A Thai born Chinese.</i>

474
01:03:41,058 --> 01:03:44,607
<i>Here are her hospital records.</i>

475
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:22,613
This is Siam-Rach Hospital ?

476
01:04:26,098 --> 01:04:28,168
This is probably the place.

477
01:04:28,218 --> 01:04:31,494
Let's get off to take a look.

478
01:04:59,138 --> 01:05:00,412
Hi.

479
01:05:00,458 --> 01:05:04,770
This is Siam-Rach Hospital?

480
01:05:04,978 --> 01:05:07,890
Yes. Right.

481
01:05:07,938 --> 01:05:10,691
I want to meet a doctor,
his name is Eak.

482
01:05:11,738 --> 01:05:13,808
Please come help.

483
01:05:16,498 --> 01:05:17,851
Can I help you?

484
01:05:17,898 --> 01:05:20,412
I want to meet a doctor,

485
01:05:20,698 --> 01:05:23,849
his name is Eak.

486
01:05:23,898 --> 01:05:26,332
You know him?

487
01:05:26,378 --> 01:05:27,811
No.

488
01:05:27,858 --> 01:05:30,418
Is there a Doctor named Eak here?

489
01:05:46,818 --> 01:05:48,854
It's mentioned here.

490
01:05:49,618 --> 01:05:52,610
It's this hospital, his name is Eak.

491
01:05:53,098 --> 01:05:54,417
He's not here now.

492
01:05:54,458 --> 01:05:57,689
Not here?

493
01:07:00,778 --> 01:07:03,815
Wah!

494
01:07:04,778 --> 01:07:07,576
Wah!

495
01:07:07,618 --> 01:07:08,733
What is it?

496
01:07:08,778 --> 01:07:09,893
This is the place.

497
01:07:09,938 --> 01:07:11,166
What place?

498
01:07:11,218 --> 01:07:13,413
The place I've been having nightmares about.

499
01:07:13,738 --> 01:07:15,490
Nightmares?

500
01:07:15,538 --> 01:07:18,689
This has to be it!

501
01:07:19,898 --> 01:07:21,570
Doctor Eak!

502
01:07:21,618 --> 01:07:22,767
What's the matter?

503
01:07:22,818 --> 01:07:25,696
You have two visitors.

504
01:07:26,778 --> 01:07:29,576
Mister, this is Dr Eak.

505
01:07:30,138 --> 01:07:31,127
You're Dr. Eak ?

506
01:07:31,178 --> 01:07:32,054
Yes.

507
01:07:32,098 --> 01:07:32,848
My name is Wah.

508
01:07:32,898 --> 01:07:34,695
Hello. Nice to meet you.

509
01:07:34,738 --> 01:07:35,966
It's about her.

510
01:07:36,018 --> 01:07:38,009
After the cornea operation,

511
01:07:38,298 --> 01:07:40,050
we've come over here

512
01:07:40,098 --> 01:07:41,656
to thank the donor's family.

513
01:07:41,698 --> 01:07:44,007
Hope you can give us some detail.

514
01:07:44,058 --> 01:07:47,494
Here is the file.

515
01:07:53,298 --> 01:07:55,607
Are you two from Hong Kong?

516
01:07:55,658 --> 01:07:57,296
You speak Mandarin?

517
01:07:57,338 --> 01:08:00,774
Can you help us?

518
01:08:01,578 --> 01:08:02,977
Sorry.

519
01:08:03,018 --> 01:08:05,213
Sorry, I can't disclose our hospital records.

520
01:08:05,538 --> 01:08:07,927
This is our hospital policy.

521
01:08:07,978 --> 01:08:09,411
Please understand.

522
01:08:09,458 --> 01:08:10,447
Wait!

523
01:08:10,498 --> 01:08:12,807
We need to see the donor's family urgently.

524
01:08:13,058 --> 01:08:14,730
Could you perhaps ask them

525
01:08:14,778 --> 01:08:17,212
if they are willing to meet us?

526
01:08:17,258 --> 01:08:19,726
Her family will not be willing to meet with you.

527
01:08:19,778 --> 01:08:22,531
Who are you to Ling?

528
01:08:22,578 --> 01:08:24,136
Please leave.

529
01:08:24,178 --> 01:08:26,851
Wait!

530
01:08:26,898 --> 01:08:28,934
After I got Ling's corneas,

531
01:08:28,978 --> 01:08:32,937
I started to see things that she saw!

532
01:08:40,418 --> 01:08:43,091
Ling was a sad and lonely girl.

533
01:08:43,138 --> 01:08:45,732
All of the villagers stayed away from her.

534
01:08:46,138 --> 01:08:48,015
Why?

535
01:08:48,058 --> 01:08:49,537
From time to time,

536
01:08:49,578 --> 01:08:51,614
she would weep outside someone's door.

537
01:08:51,658 --> 01:08:53,376
Afterwards,

538
01:08:53,418 --> 01:08:55,773
a person in that house would pass away.

539
01:08:56,458 --> 01:08:59,018
So everyone took her to be a witch...

540
01:08:59,418 --> 01:09:01,568
and always chased her away when they saw her.

541
01:09:03,058 --> 01:09:05,526
The children treated her like a monster.

542
01:09:06,538 --> 01:09:09,814
Even I, threw stones at her when I was a kid...

543
01:09:11,178 --> 01:09:14,136
Because none of you could believe
that she foresaw death?

544
01:09:15,298 --> 01:09:18,574
Maybe it was because of fear.

545
01:09:18,618 --> 01:09:22,213
So, do you believe it now?

546
01:09:33,058 --> 01:09:36,334
This is it.

547
01:09:51,618 --> 01:09:54,974
Mrs. Chui, these two friends are from Hong Kong.

548
01:09:57,578 --> 01:10:00,172
Nobody welcomed Ling.

549
01:10:00,218 --> 01:10:03,369
So she hardly ever set foot in the village.

550
01:10:05,658 --> 01:10:07,614
Yet, on the night of the fire,

551
01:10:07,658 --> 01:10:09,091
many saw her running around,

552
01:10:09,138 --> 01:10:11,254
shouting hysterically...

553
01:10:11,738 --> 01:10:14,775
as if talking to herself.

554
01:10:14,818 --> 01:10:16,809
Since everyone detested Ling,

555
01:10:17,258 --> 01:10:19,294
no one paid any attention to her.

556
01:10:20,178 --> 01:10:23,727
Some villagers threw water on her,

557
01:10:23,978 --> 01:10:26,731
to drive her away.

558
01:10:26,778 --> 01:10:29,770
Around midnight, a big fire erupted...

559
01:10:30,298 --> 01:10:32,687
and kept burning till noon the next day.

560
01:10:32,738 --> 01:10:36,413
Among the deceased three hundred
were burnt beyond recognition.

561
01:10:36,978 --> 01:10:38,411
How exactly did Ling die?

562
01:10:38,458 --> 01:10:41,575
She hanged herself.

563
01:10:47,578 --> 01:10:50,934
Ling killed herself the day
after the big fire.

564
01:10:58,498 --> 01:11:00,932
Is Mrs. Chui all right?

565
01:11:00,978 --> 01:11:03,936
She's fine.

566
01:11:04,978 --> 01:11:07,173
So you too believed that she wasn't insane,

567
01:11:07,218 --> 01:11:09,209
but that she only saw things no one else could.

568
01:11:10,538 --> 01:11:12,369
She foresaw a big disaster,

569
01:11:12,418 --> 01:11:13,612
and tried to warn everyone,

570
01:11:13,658 --> 01:11:15,728
but no one listened to her.

571
01:11:15,778 --> 01:11:18,212
I don't understand any of this spiritual stuff.

572
01:11:18,258 --> 01:11:20,533
I just want you two to know that

573
01:11:20,578 --> 01:11:23,217
Ling was a very kind person...

574
01:11:24,538 --> 01:11:28,213
and she had a tough life.

575
01:11:28,418 --> 01:11:32,377
Can I take a look at Ling's room?

576
01:11:50,978 --> 01:11:52,616
Tonight...

577
01:11:52,658 --> 01:11:53,807
...I want to stay here.

578
01:11:53,858 --> 01:11:56,850
I'll take you to Ling's grave tomorrow morning.

579
01:11:57,458 --> 01:12:01,133
You've been very kind to us, thank you.

580
01:12:01,658 --> 01:12:04,934
You should go to bed now.

581
01:12:06,138 --> 01:12:08,015
Alright, I'll stay next door.

582
01:12:08,058 --> 01:12:11,209
Shout if anything happens.

583
01:13:16,378 --> 01:13:19,097
I know you've wanted me
to come here all this time.

584
01:13:19,138 --> 01:13:21,254
Well, here I am now.

585
01:13:21,298 --> 01:13:25,132
What do you want to tell me?

586
01:13:49,498 --> 01:13:54,697
<i>... ill-fated... ill-fated...</i>

587
01:13:55,138 --> 01:13:59,051
<i>Hurry... take her to the hospital!</i>

588
01:13:59,338 --> 01:14:01,977
<i>Get lost...</i>

589
01:14:02,298 --> 01:14:06,610
<i>You should be ashamed of yourself...</i>

590
01:14:07,018 --> 01:14:09,896
<i>You are a curse!</i>

591
01:14:18,218 --> 01:14:21,210
<i>Told you not to come here!</i>

592
01:14:21,458 --> 01:14:25,610
<i>She's evil! Don't ever play with her!</i>

593
01:14:32,738 --> 01:14:35,935
<i>Go save him! Save my boy...</i>

594
01:14:36,178 --> 01:14:39,454
<i>Help him... Make him breathe...</i>

595
01:14:39,698 --> 01:14:41,177
<i>What have you done to my boy...</i>

596
01:14:41,218 --> 01:14:42,617
<i>You little bitch! Go to hell...</i>

597
01:14:42,658 --> 01:14:44,296
<i>She's evil!</i>

598
01:14:44,338 --> 01:14:47,933
<i>Stay away from my house! Get lost!</i>

599
01:14:49,098 --> 01:14:50,417
<i>Be reasonable!</i>

600
01:14:50,458 --> 01:14:52,608
<i>My daughter is only trying to help...</i>

601
01:14:54,018 --> 01:14:56,532
<i>Go away!</i>

602
01:15:52,418 --> 01:15:55,012
Mrs. Chui, I know how to help Ling.

603
01:15:55,218 --> 01:15:56,936
Let's go upstairs to see her.

604
01:15:56,978 --> 01:15:58,934
Her most painful time was not in the past,

605
01:15:58,978 --> 01:16:00,616
it's right now!

606
01:16:00,658 --> 01:16:01,886
Since she killed herself,

607
01:16:01,938 --> 01:16:04,247
she's been trapped in a time warp...
constantly repeating her suicide.

608
01:16:04,698 --> 01:16:06,370
She was dead.

609
01:16:06,418 --> 01:16:08,886
How can someone who's dead die again?

610
01:16:08,938 --> 01:16:10,656
Listen to me,

611
01:16:10,698 --> 01:16:12,848
very soon she'll appear upstairs.

612
01:16:15,898 --> 01:16:17,490
Let's go up to see her!

613
01:16:17,538 --> 01:16:20,098
I won't see her!

614
01:16:20,138 --> 01:16:22,493
I spent my whole life protecting her,

615
01:16:22,538 --> 01:16:25,291
I never once gave up on her,

616
01:16:25,338 --> 01:16:29,126
but she gave up on herself!

617
01:16:29,458 --> 01:16:33,371
For that I can never forgive her!

618
01:16:37,658 --> 01:16:39,250
Just listen,

619
01:16:39,298 --> 01:16:41,334
I'm sure you hear this sound every night.

620
01:16:42,778 --> 01:16:45,167
Ling died at three o' clock, didn't she?

621
01:16:55,018 --> 01:16:58,215
Mrs. Chui, come with me and you'll understand!

622
01:16:58,498 --> 01:17:02,207
I'm not going upstairs!

623
01:17:49,378 --> 01:17:56,295
<i>Mom...</i>

624
01:17:58,258 --> 01:18:00,931
<i>Help me...</i>

625
01:18:02,578 --> 01:18:05,172
<i>Help me...</i>

626
01:18:05,418 --> 01:18:07,534
Ling?

627
01:18:07,578 --> 01:18:09,808
<i>Help me...</i>

628
01:18:20,538 --> 01:18:23,814
<i>Help me!</i>

629
01:18:50,258 --> 01:18:52,818
<i>Help me... help me...</i>

630
01:18:52,978 --> 01:18:54,616
Is it Ling?

631
01:18:54,658 --> 01:18:58,412
Is it really Ling?

632
01:18:59,458 --> 01:19:02,928
<i>Mom...</i>

633
01:19:03,138 --> 01:19:05,493
<i>Help me...</i>

634
01:19:06,178 --> 01:19:09,011
Ling, you were the one who left me...

635
01:19:11,298 --> 01:19:16,736
you were the one who left me...

636
01:19:16,898 --> 01:19:19,014
<i>Mom...</i>

637
01:19:19,058 --> 01:19:21,856
<i>Help me...</i>

638
01:19:27,098 --> 01:19:30,170
<i>Mom...</i>

639
01:19:30,858 --> 01:19:32,974
Ling, Mommy is coming!

640
01:19:35,138 --> 01:19:38,733
Ling! Ling!

641
01:19:41,458 --> 01:19:44,894
My girl, mommy's right here.

642
01:19:45,258 --> 01:19:48,967
Don't be afraid.

643
01:19:49,018 --> 01:19:51,771
No one can bully you anymore.

644
01:19:52,178 --> 01:19:56,217
Mom, I'm so sorry.

645
01:19:57,618 --> 01:20:01,088
I was wrong.

646
01:20:01,138 --> 01:20:03,368
Please forgive me!

647
01:20:07,138 --> 01:20:09,572
I've already forgiven you.

648
01:20:24,058 --> 01:20:26,413
Mun!

649
01:20:26,458 --> 01:20:28,892
What happened?

650
01:20:28,938 --> 01:20:32,214
Are you alright?

651
01:23:51,538 --> 01:23:53,654
Go that way! Move over...

652
01:23:54,698 --> 01:23:56,689
Hurry! Pull him out!

653
01:23:56,898 --> 01:23:59,207
Careful! Come on keep pulling...

654
01:24:07,138 --> 01:24:10,972
Over there! Move!

655
01:25:41,298 --> 01:25:43,095
Get out!

656
01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:46,016
Get out!

657
01:25:46,258 --> 01:25:47,737
<i>Something's happening,
get out, quick!</i>

658
01:25:47,778 --> 01:25:49,257
<i>Granny, leave your house now!</i>

659
01:25:49,298 --> 01:25:52,734
<i>Leave your house now!</i>

660
01:25:53,978 --> 01:25:55,809
<i>Brother, run for your life!</i>

661
01:25:55,858 --> 01:25:57,849
Get out! Quick! Run!

662
01:25:58,058 --> 01:26:01,175
Get out! Run...

663
01:26:01,218 --> 01:26:03,334
Run! Run for your life!

664
01:26:03,498 --> 01:26:07,173
Run! Run for your life!

665
01:26:10,378 --> 01:26:13,848
<i>Run! A disaster is coming!</i>

666
01:26:34,738 --> 01:26:36,569
Run! Run now!

667
01:26:36,618 --> 01:26:37,607
What's she saying?

668
01:26:37,658 --> 01:26:40,809
Run! Get out!

669
01:27:06,018 --> 01:27:07,167
Mun!

670
01:27:07,218 --> 01:27:09,607
Go, go, go... Move over...

671
01:27:21,258 --> 01:27:23,294
Go, go, go... Move over...

672
01:27:46,178 --> 01:27:49,693
...Listen to me...

673
01:30:59,658 --> 01:31:03,048
<i>Ever since that day, Ling never appears again.</i>

674
01:31:03,818 --> 01:31:05,774
<i>I hold no resentment towards her...</i>

675
01:31:05,818 --> 01:31:09,606
<i>Since I saw and experienced
the same pain that she did.</i>

676
01:31:10,138 --> 01:31:12,732
<i>But aside from pain,</i>

677
01:31:13,098 --> 01:31:16,135
<i>I saw beauty.</i>

678
01:31:16,938 --> 01:31:19,771
<i>I no longer question why am I blind.</i>

679
01:31:20,458 --> 01:31:21,891
<i>It is because</i>

680
01:31:21,938 --> 01:31:24,850
<i>I've already seen the most beautiful
things in this world.</i>

681
01:31:25,298 --> 01:31:27,971
<i>Things I'll never forget.</i>
