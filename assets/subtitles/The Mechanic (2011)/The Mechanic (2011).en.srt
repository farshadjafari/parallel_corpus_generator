NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA

3
00:05:47,354 --> 00:05:50,355
For what I do is a certain
thinking is needed.

4
00:05:52,489 --> 00:05:54,005
I run commands.

5
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,107
Designated targets.

6
00:05:58,314 --> 00:06:01,389
Some commands have
of accidents appear.

7
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,843
Others need someone else
suspicion.

8
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,574
Few have a selective
a clear message is needed.

9
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,696
An easy pull the trigger.

10
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:25,867
The best assignments are those
where nobody knows you're there.

CARTEL LEADER, LARA JORGE,
ACCIDENTALLY DROWNED

12
00:06:52,352 --> 00:06:55,426
A fairy brought me yesterday
a visit.

13
00:06:56,131 --> 00:07:00,755
Gave me an old bottle of Scotch.
He knows the good stuff.

14
00:07:03,653 --> 00:07:05,869
Goodbye, Henry.

15
00:07:31,115 --> 00:07:35,049
Why did you bring me
rotplek brought to this?

16
00:07:35,165 --> 00:07:40,111
You're a snob.
There are 1100 people each day through.

17
00:07:40,313 --> 00:07:44,401
Two people in transit
are difficult to remember.

18
00:07:45,181 --> 00:07:47,542
Of course, those people
will remember.

19
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:55,044
Defeats that your goal a little bit?
I'm not going anywhere without them.

20
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,284
Let them do something about their costume,
they do not look.

21
00:07:59,385 --> 00:08:01,480
Everything went well?

22
00:08:02,314 --> 00:08:04,482
It's done.

23
00:08:05,974 --> 00:08:08,487
I am better than you.

24
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:11,704
Why they give you those commands.
It may be a little rough ...

25
00:08:12,087 --> 00:08:14,438
if they are rough and you trade it off ...

26
00:08:14,514 --> 00:08:18,214
and to give them no more.
Served, no loose ends.

27
00:08:18,302 --> 00:08:22,686
Fait accompli.
You're a machine.

28
00:08:23,905 --> 00:08:26,841
You see things,
you watch people ...

29
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:32,472
different from me or anyone else does.
But you have a problem.

30
00:08:32,514 --> 00:08:35,340
You do need friendship.
- I got you, Harry.

31
00:08:35,457 --> 00:08:38,623
You're in bigger trouble
than I thought.

32
00:08:39,527 --> 00:08:44,694
How's Steve?
- Did I say I'm kept a job?

33
00:08:44,965 --> 00:08:48,436
They fired him last month.
He hit a man half dead.

34
00:08:52,034 --> 00:08:56,704
Damn disappointment.
It always will.

35
00:08:58,446 --> 00:09:01,564
Call him.
- I call him?

36
00:09:01,661 --> 00:09:05,661
Why?
- He wants to adopt to hear from you.

37
00:09:08,165 --> 00:09:10,709
We're going to get money.

38
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,536
Come dance with me.

39
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:01,196
Come on, please.

40
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:40,251
Are you hungry?

41
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,431
Yes.

42
00:10:57,838 --> 00:10:59,630
I gotta go.

43
00:11:15,812 --> 00:11:18,196
Will you still say your name?

44
00:11:22,905 --> 00:11:24,573
Arthur.

45
00:11:25,878 --> 00:11:28,857
Nice try, but you
Arthur does not look like one.

46
00:11:29,294 --> 00:11:33,088
No, more like a David.

47
00:11:33,388 --> 00:11:35,390
Or Brad.

48
00:11:36,421 --> 00:11:39,564
Yes, must have been a Brad.

HARRY M. McKENNA
(09/11/1947 -)

53
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:25,144
Global Engineering.
- I'm calling for the ad.

54
00:12:25,673 --> 00:12:28,591
There must be a mistake.
- One moment.

55
00:12:30,721 --> 00:12:33,910
The information of the advertisement is correct.

56
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:37,165
I want an appointment.

57
00:12:37,587 --> 00:12:39,828
We call you back.

58
00:12:45,996 --> 00:12:48,337
Mr. Bishop, Mr. Dean agree
for an appointment.

59
00:12:48,453 --> 00:12:52,326
A private plane within one hour to remove
and bring you to an area he chooses.

60
00:12:52,442 --> 00:12:56,361
You get fifteen minutes.
The plane will take you back.

61
00:12:56,743 --> 00:13:00,689
As we say around ten hours
home should be, is not half past ten.

62
00:13:00,894 --> 00:13:04,331
I do not care, baby. Your mother
was afraid. Two weeks under house arrest.

63
00:13:04,739 --> 00:13:06,325
One moment.

64
00:13:08,745 --> 00:13:10,787
That's not my problem.

65
00:13:11,913 --> 00:13:15,530
Ten days and you will voluntarily
two Saturdays working at the shelter.

66
00:13:16,558 --> 00:13:18,425
Eight days and three times seven hours.

67
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:20,883
Beautiful ring.
- Agreed.

68
00:13:20,917 --> 00:13:23,346
So I want one as well.
- Do not.

69
00:13:23,832 --> 00:13:26,834
Unless you are a world champion.
- Say that he is making.

70
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:29,347
We go.

71
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:36,382
I just lost a bargaining
and with sixteen.

72
00:13:37,221 --> 00:13:38,579
Let's take a walk.

73
00:13:42,877 --> 00:13:47,771
Six months ago we asked
the largest contract ever to adopt.

74
00:13:48,021 --> 00:13:51,436
The target had a higher priority
than we are used.

75
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:55,453
The assignment was too lush.
- The target was South African?

76
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:59,196
Target fled to South Africa
and when we turned to.

77
00:13:59,312 --> 00:14:01,410
Setting up lasted six months.

78
00:14:01,526 --> 00:14:05,248
A team of five agents
to the mission work.

79
00:14:05,364 --> 00:14:09,787
All five were slain them.
Someone knew everything.

80
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:15,137
You knew, someone from that team.
- This. Sebastian.

81
00:14:16,408 --> 00:14:18,869
You know how this business works.

82
00:14:19,315 --> 00:14:22,513
Only two partners know
the details of a contract.

83
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:28,297
Two people knew this
details. Me and Harry McKenna.

84
00:14:29,238 --> 00:14:31,021
Harry has betrayed us.

85
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:38,816
We have examined his finances,
Look at that international transfers.

86
00:14:39,219 --> 00:14:42,754
One two weeks ago
for $ 20,000,000.

87
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:46,122
He is old, weak.

88
00:14:46,448 --> 00:14:50,429
Countless dead, divorced,
a son with problems.

89
00:14:50,545 --> 00:14:52,343
That made him vulnerable.

90
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:57,475
And the past 13 years I have him
been faithful. Much respect for him.

91
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:02,238
But Harry McKenna
poisoned the well. He has to go.

92
00:15:02,477 --> 00:15:05,349
Immediately.
- Let me talk to him.

93
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:10,691
I appreciate your connection,
but there is no going back.

94
00:15:11,672 --> 00:15:14,277
He has gone outside his book.

95
00:15:14,311 --> 00:15:18,005
As long as he remains alive,
He is a danger of this company.

96
00:15:19,136 --> 00:15:22,137
We prefer
that you handle this ...

97
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:26,350
view your relationship with him.
Thus, fast and discreet.

98
00:15:26,864 --> 00:15:30,309
I want him to be honest
unnecessary suffering.

99
00:15:31,424 --> 00:15:35,308
We do not want an outsider to go.
But we will if necessary.

100
00:15:37,388 --> 00:15:38,899
Excuse me.

101
00:15:41,784 --> 00:15:44,548
The negotiations are closed, sorry.

102
00:15:45,167 --> 00:15:48,466
I'm in a meeting.
Wait.

103
00:15:50,162 --> 00:15:53,720
48 hours or we will take action.

104
00:15:55,976 --> 00:16:00,677
Once the expression
"Stop your advantage if you" heard?

105
00:16:04,152 --> 00:16:09,059
Roosevelt was truly my hero.

106
00:16:09,523 --> 00:16:14,433
The way he dealt with it.
That damn chair.

107
00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:16,896
Pull your pants up.

108
00:16:17,105 --> 00:16:20,067
These costumes are you not so good.

109
00:16:33,389 --> 00:16:37,816
CONTRARY TO informant
ALL FIVE ACCUSED MURDER

110
00:17:14,186 --> 00:17:17,419
Yes?
- Get out of the building, Harry.

111
00:17:17,724 --> 00:17:20,661
Arthur?
- They come to you tonight.

112
00:17:20,778 --> 00:17:23,664
Who is coming?
- Dean.

113
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:28,158
Take what you can use against them
and leave.

114
00:17:28,274 --> 00:17:31,084
Got a pair of scissors?

115
00:17:34,585 --> 00:17:37,318
Go to the lift hall.
- Way.

116
00:17:44,487 --> 00:17:46,711
The electricity is away on the 18th floor.

117
00:17:46,748 --> 00:17:51,020
You have 15 seconds to get to the service lift
for the emergency is concerned.

118
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:53,218
There is a keyboard.
- Press the number of 's building.

119
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:57,181
The electricity is still out?
- Service lifts have a separate power supply.

120
00:17:58,525 --> 00:17:59,687
I am inside.

121
00:18:00,181 --> 00:18:04,527
Press the basement.
The lift will do about 18 seconds.

122
00:18:04,863 --> 00:18:08,449
That floor is empty and unused.
Take the ramp.

123
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:13,262
This is a connection to the building next door
which leads to an underground car park.

124
00:18:14,478 --> 00:18:15,801
Damn.

125
00:18:17,402 --> 00:18:21,640
The security cameras are not yet
associated with this building. They are blind.

126
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:31,032
You should now be in the parking lot.

127
00:18:42,073 --> 00:18:45,748
My bus is here.
- I left it there.

128
00:18:46,472 --> 00:18:48,720
Damn.

129
00:18:56,077 --> 00:18:59,934
You gave me my own security
dropped off.

130
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,791
No one sees me leave.

131
00:19:06,231 --> 00:19:09,583
What is this?
Cape Town is not it?

132
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,875
Exactly.

133
00:19:16,006 --> 00:19:18,194
What's the story here?

134
00:19:18,296 --> 00:19:19,872
Car theft?

135
00:19:20,115 --> 00:19:24,473
They find my bus at least
somewhere in a corrupt place in town.

136
00:19:24,717 --> 00:19:27,439
Stripped and on blocks.

137
00:19:27,487 --> 00:19:29,193
Something.

138
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:35,096
It's funny, auditoriale a review.

139
00:19:35,576 --> 00:19:37,100
You do not mind it?

140
00:19:40,466 --> 00:19:43,807
AMAT VICTORIA Curamé

141
00:19:43,923 --> 00:19:46,077
VICTORY MEANS OF PREPARATION

142
00:19:54,285 --> 00:19:57,249
I fired a few shots,
There is a struggle ...

143
00:19:57,346 --> 00:20:01,229
they take my gun.
That is life.

144
00:20:01,244 --> 00:20:04,444
I go at least not down
like a sissy.

145
00:20:06,854 --> 00:20:09,386
I already 33 years.

146
00:20:10,946 --> 00:20:14,556
A gift of Admiral Beasly, sixth fleet.

147
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:18,972
This is the first time
I fired it.

148
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:23,320
Why did you kill me?

149
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:27,833
They send somebody else.

150
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:32,766
I'd rather it was you.

151
00:20:34,515 --> 00:20:36,465
I have to live with it.

152
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:25,741
McKENNA

153
00:21:37,205 --> 00:21:40,733
Arthur Bishop, fucking.
- Condolences.

154
00:21:41,564 --> 00:21:44,182
It's more a loss for you
than me, pal.

155
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,673
It was long ago.

156
00:22:09,899 --> 00:22:13,012
Give me a lift to
my father's house?

157
00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:23,733
Your father talked a lot about you.

158
00:22:24,118 --> 00:22:26,958
About spend time with you.
Make it right.

159
00:22:27,132 --> 00:22:28,930
Let it go.

160
00:22:29,263 --> 00:22:31,458
He was always talking about you.

161
00:22:32,348 --> 00:22:35,901
He repented of things.
- He always had to call.

162
00:22:50,763 --> 00:22:52,516
I want to show you something.

163
00:23:01,856 --> 00:23:04,890
I thought it was great here as a child.

164
00:23:11,411 --> 00:23:13,277
Pretty impressive, huh?

165
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:18,901
They each had their country.

166
00:23:19,938 --> 00:23:22,459
I suppose I
it can try to recover.

167
00:23:22,981 --> 00:23:24,732
They proud.

168
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:28,178
I love with you.

169
00:23:28,697 --> 00:23:32,757
I do not know if a picture
of my father have?

170
00:23:33,028 --> 00:23:34,794
If you want one.

171
00:23:44,969 --> 00:23:47,628
You seem to not stay?

172
00:23:47,744 --> 00:23:51,356
Why yes?
He left behind no will.

173
00:23:51,373 --> 00:23:54,510
The accounts are empty.
The banks can take home.

174
00:23:54,832 --> 00:23:59,950
Against a lawyer in this state
nothing is left.

175
00:24:00,066 --> 00:24:03,540
Where you going?
- A nice place.

176
00:24:06,428 --> 00:24:09,706
Do you need money?
- No, thanks.

177
00:24:11,195 --> 00:24:14,384
A man comes along
and will look to the car.

178
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,560
I go there for a while to do.

179
00:24:18,963 --> 00:24:20,537
And the weapons?

180
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:28,389
I wanted a couple tonight
Car thieves shoot.

181
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:33,446
Just a random car thief?

182
00:24:33,563 --> 00:24:37,282
Who knows, I am the murderer
my father's still disappointing.

183
00:24:37,936 --> 00:24:39,925
If you feel better.

184
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,367
Damned if I would know.

185
00:24:44,322 --> 00:24:45,832
I'll find out.

186
00:24:56,065 --> 00:24:58,291
Let it go, Steve.

187
00:25:02,473 --> 00:25:04,314
Bishop ...

188
00:25:05,481 --> 00:25:09,556
what kind of n-person shooters
Moreover, someone in a wheelchair down?

189
00:26:12,128 --> 00:26:14,432
Need help?

190
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:20,163
No, I got it.

191
00:26:21,506 --> 00:26:25,448
I would meet a friend,
but I may be wrong address.

192
00:26:25,796 --> 00:26:27,711
Yeah, maybe.

193
00:26:27,827 --> 00:26:31,653
Maybe my address wrong.

194
00:26:33,562 --> 00:26:36,703
Nice car, man.
- Thanks.

195
00:26:38,506 --> 00:26:41,357
Will I?
- What?

196
00:26:41,473 --> 00:26:45,722
I hold you to your transport.
Get out of the car.

197
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,906
Seriously?
- Yes.

198
00:26:50,228 --> 00:26:53,509
Jesus. Good.

199
00:26:59,874 --> 00:27:01,716
Car Thief.

200
00:27:04,835 --> 00:27:06,768
You shoot this?

201
00:27:07,872 --> 00:27:09,822
Is this the weapon you used?

202
00:27:10,998 --> 00:27:12,126
No?

203
00:27:44,007 --> 00:27:45,785
Bad move.

204
00:27:47,619 --> 00:27:50,200
You thought you had this thought, eh?

205
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:56,285
It looks like not,
but tonight is your lucky night.

206
00:27:56,336 --> 00:27:58,206
Raymond.

207
00:27:58,561 --> 00:28:00,074
Stand up.

208
00:28:00,354 --> 00:28:04,014
You just fell down.
Otherwise we will find you.

209
00:28:04,327 --> 00:28:06,026
Go away.

210
00:28:08,993 --> 00:28:11,478
You're stupid to kill someone
If you have a motive.

211
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,838
You might as well be a
bulls eye sign on your back.

212
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:17,349
It fascinates me nothing.
I realize it.

213
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:21,198
Get out of here.

214
00:28:30,378 --> 00:28:32,209
Damn.

215
00:29:12,107 --> 00:29:15,970
I thought about what you said last night.

216
00:29:16,848 --> 00:29:18,576
I want to know what you know.

217
00:29:19,363 --> 00:29:23,092
Go online.
Everything on the Internet.

218
00:29:23,908 --> 00:29:27,576
I would not read it.
I want to do.

219
00:29:28,436 --> 00:29:31,993
What to do?
- Take me taking the piss.

220
00:29:32,109 --> 00:29:35,161
I know about you.
And him.

221
00:29:35,671 --> 00:29:39,895
He was your mentor. He chose you above me.
Now you owe him something.

222
00:29:40,688 --> 00:29:44,300
Now he is dead, you have nothing.
You now owe me anything.

223
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:47,572
Go home, Steve.

224
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:14,353
Still for sale.

225
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:18,932
I know you want it.
No life like this.

226
00:30:20,303 --> 00:30:24,782
Want some advice?
Find out what you say this.

227
00:30:25,592 --> 00:30:28,431
He's trying to say something.

228
00:30:28,496 --> 00:30:32,392
He says you have to nostalgia
something you've never been before.

229
00:31:03,951 --> 00:31:07,261
Elboranostreet 8600.
7.00 hours tomorrow.

230
00:31:14,168 --> 00:31:16,629
Where can I be of service?

231
00:31:23,206 --> 00:31:25,612
What is this place?
- An animal shelter.

232
00:31:25,673 --> 00:31:28,938
I know, but why are we here?
- I look for a dog.

233
00:31:28,994 --> 00:31:32,610
Not even a year old. If possible.
- I thought you loved cats.

234
00:31:36,122 --> 00:31:39,742
You know what a Mechanic,
at least the definition?

235
00:31:39,921 --> 00:31:43,786
A boy who makes things right.
Problems, contracts.

236
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,213
An assassin.
- I do commissions.

237
00:31:47,682 --> 00:31:50,542
Designated targets.
- I can do.

238
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:53,373
I have seen it.
- No, you do not.

239
00:31:55,048 --> 00:31:57,904
You know nothing about me.

240
00:31:58,196 --> 00:32:01,180
Steven Jackson McKenna.
Born in Baltimore, Maryland.

241
00:32:01,238 --> 00:32:04,439
Your mother died when you were 12.
Addicted to painkillers and vodka.

242
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:07,931
You went to three different schools.
Grunt, the Parc and Munro.

243
00:32:08,047 --> 00:32:10,202
Well received in four sports
a scholarship from Miami ...

244
00:32:10,259 --> 00:32:13,886
which was rejected for conviction of
drug possession with intent to distribute.

245
00:32:14,126 --> 00:32:18,287
Four convictions for assault
and threats to three different friends.

246
00:32:18,404 --> 00:32:22,293
Broke your kneecap in a fight. You told
that no one so you let it heal so.

247
00:32:22,368 --> 00:32:25,801
When it rains, you run short.
I want to do X-rays show.

248
00:32:31,528 --> 00:32:34,632
A friend would adopt this little boy.

249
00:32:36,925 --> 00:32:38,995
Good boy.

250
00:32:48,371 --> 00:32:50,853
What I waste requires
a special way of thinking.

251
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,748
Revenge is an emotion which
You can be killed.

252
00:32:53,802 --> 00:32:56,713
So no stupid stunts
like last night.

253
00:33:02,187 --> 00:33:04,785
Walk it, feel it, make it your best friend.

254
00:33:04,901 --> 00:33:07,385
Tomorrow, eleven hours, Fisher Square.

255
00:33:21,785 --> 00:33:24,300
Take the dog to the coffee shop
in Riverdale.

256
00:33:24,725 --> 00:33:26,897
Order coffee.
Black.

257
00:33:27,273 --> 00:33:30,494
Go to the table by the window.
And make the sudoku puzzle in the newspaper.

258
00:33:30,611 --> 00:33:33,825
Make love to your dog.
How long? One hour.

259
00:33:34,964 --> 00:33:37,503
Every day, three weeks long.

260
00:33:59,844 --> 00:34:02,482
This is yours.

261
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:19,116
Practice some of this.

262
00:34:19,492 --> 00:34:22,484
The insurance companies know
all about how someone dies.

263
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,428
They have books with insurance experts.

264
00:34:24,544 --> 00:34:27,324
List of every conceivable cause of death.

265
00:34:27,656 --> 00:34:29,872
Why let me see all this?

266
00:34:29,988 --> 00:34:33,993
Good analytical ability comes from experience
and that comes from poor judgment.

267
00:34:50,712 --> 00:34:54,550
The bed is under the boxes.
Help yourself.

268
00:35:20,723 --> 00:35:22,616
How long have you been to?

269
00:35:24,949 --> 00:35:28,710
Two years.
- It's beautiful.

270
00:35:29,547 --> 00:35:34,140
When are we going for a ride?
- We? Never.

271
00:35:36,351 --> 00:35:38,934
It is time for your training
the next level.

272
00:35:59,632 --> 00:36:01,882
Who is that?
- He's fine.

273
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:04,012
I have only you checked.

274
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:08,310
I can come back.
Better to remain here.

275
00:36:17,953 --> 00:36:20,862
I have the nerves.

276
00:36:20,979 --> 00:36:23,710
Do not know if this is a good time
for me to do something.

277
00:36:24,989 --> 00:36:27,203
There is too much going on.

278
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:30,526
I have the list and the money charged.

279
00:36:32,335 --> 00:36:34,173
Now is the right time.

280
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,782
Let me see that list again.

281
00:36:42,404 --> 00:36:45,210
All for where?
- As soon as possible.

282
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:49,331
Good.
I have one day for that.

283
00:36:50,302 --> 00:36:52,730
Give me the money.

284
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,608
Auto Sexuality fixation?
- Yes.

285
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:40,066
I thought you had to see one up close.

286
00:38:02,592 --> 00:38:04,735
Never Touch this.

287
00:38:23,324 --> 00:38:25,519
Follow me.

288
00:38:34,957 --> 00:38:39,190
Who was he?
- A job. Nothing more or less.

289
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:42,269
If you you feel better, he was
an illegal arms dealer.

290
00:38:43,007 --> 00:38:44,680
Sold weapons to anyone.

291
00:38:44,951 --> 00:38:48,077
Police murderers, gangs,
terrorists.

292
00:38:48,385 --> 00:38:50,223
He does not discriminate.

293
00:39:00,658 --> 00:39:02,924
Here is the file.

294
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,622
The guy from the coffee shop?

295
00:39:08,443 --> 00:39:10,471
All yours.

296
00:39:10,768 --> 00:39:14,574
You would not tell him, but
He is a Mechanic for a different group.

297
00:39:15,594 --> 00:39:18,604
His only routine is coffee
from nine to ten.

298
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:20,852
He comes twice nowhere, except here.

299
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,546
He is isolated and protected.

300
00:39:24,761 --> 00:39:28,674
No way in without being seen.
He has two weaknesses.

301
00:39:28,707 --> 00:39:30,816
Chihuahuas.
- May I sit?

302
00:39:30,916 --> 00:39:32,666
Go ahead.
- And boys.

303
00:39:33,055 --> 00:39:35,732
Young boys.
- Coffee, black.

304
00:39:35,848 --> 00:39:39,678
He checked up,
but found no connection.

305
00:39:39,795 --> 00:39:42,573
All he sees is a lost boy.

306
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:44,951
Would you hold it?
- Yes.

307
00:39:45,028 --> 00:39:47,539
He loves it.
- Come here, baby.

308
00:39:47,634 --> 00:39:51,040
If he is interested, he asks you ...

309
00:39:51,262 --> 00:39:52,517
Do you live around here Steve?

310
00:39:52,577 --> 00:39:55,309
Your answer should be.
- I'm everywhere and nowhere.

311
00:39:55,555 --> 00:39:57,752
Which means you're broke
and open to suggestions.

312
00:39:57,868 --> 00:40:00,004
Who is my buddy.

313
00:40:00,057 --> 00:40:03,068
Then he asks if you ...
- You want some drink with me?

314
00:40:03,111 --> 00:40:05,147
Your answer should be.
- Yes.

315
00:40:06,792 --> 00:40:09,171
That's great, right?

316
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:12,922
You have a paralysis agent.
- Novice.

317
00:40:13,779 --> 00:40:16,292
I have to murder him not to rape you?

318
00:40:19,789 --> 00:40:21,586
Two or three drops and he is dizzy.

319
00:40:21,996 --> 00:40:26,224
Five or six, he's brain.
And his heart stops in 20 minutes.

320
00:40:27,078 --> 00:40:29,661
Do it in the bar.
Keep it clean.

321
00:40:35,663 --> 00:40:38,747
These luxury tents are always concerned ...

322
00:40:38,864 --> 00:40:41,601
Therefore as soon as they close.

323
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:45,827
They do not worry so.
- It is very tasty.

324
00:40:46,016 --> 00:40:47,471
You know it?
- Yes.

325
00:40:47,587 --> 00:40:49,978
Jameson, right?
- Yes, two please.

326
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,829
Not playing with this guy.
Do it in the bar, clean and tidy.

327
00:41:05,767 --> 00:41:09,073
I want to know what you know.
I want to do.

328
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:23,625
What?
What's funny?

329
00:41:23,742 --> 00:41:28,056
I think I have too much.
- No, come on.

330
00:41:28,172 --> 00:41:32,091
I drink it up and then I ...

331
00:41:34,734 --> 00:41:38,467
I really need to go to bed ...
But it was funny.

332
00:41:51,684 --> 00:41:53,517
Okay?

333
00:41:53,578 --> 00:41:56,598
Yeah, how are you?
- Good.

334
00:41:57,711 --> 00:42:01,363
Can I give you a lift?
The car is here.

335
00:42:02,369 --> 00:42:05,120
Come, I want to show you something.

336
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:08,549
Yes?
- 1.90, 136 kg and deadly.

337
00:42:08,845 --> 00:42:10,857
Make this man angry.

338
00:42:10,866 --> 00:42:14,132
Whatever you do,
Never step into his car.

339
00:42:30,142 --> 00:42:31,430
What do you think?

340
00:42:32,709 --> 00:42:35,767
It's beautiful.
- Just drink suits.

341
00:42:40,553 --> 00:42:43,847
Do you paint?
- It's more like a hobby.

342
00:42:44,108 --> 00:42:46,892
Serious hobby.

343
00:42:49,742 --> 00:42:51,661
Cheers.

344
00:42:52,448 --> 00:42:54,640
That is the sitting area and fireplace.

345
00:42:54,757 --> 00:42:59,632
The relax room.
- This area I'm really proud of.

346
00:43:00,702 --> 00:43:05,235
This is good.
- This is the 14th-century Buddha.

347
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:09,488
That was hard to get into the country.

348
00:43:09,604 --> 00:43:13,579
Well good to have friends.
Friends who make a difference.

349
00:43:16,449 --> 00:43:18,740
Do you have good friends?

350
00:43:21,569 --> 00:43:24,098
I mean really good friends.

351
00:43:27,551 --> 00:43:31,407
You're shaking like a leaf.

352
00:43:51,809 --> 00:43:54,112
Slow down, cowboy.

353
00:46:29,272 --> 00:46:31,714
I said you should do nicely.

354
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:22,337
See you later.

355
00:47:42,121 --> 00:47:44,838
Was it work or pleasure?

356
00:47:48,428 --> 00:47:51,588
I wish someone hurt me so.

357
00:48:39,395 --> 00:48:43,391
Thank you.
- I call him Arthur.

358
00:49:24,495 --> 00:49:26,529
Press 1

359
00:49:31,206 --> 00:49:34,863
You sent an outsider
your job to do.

360
00:49:35,225 --> 00:49:37,322
That is a violation of our agreement.

361
00:49:37,439 --> 00:49:41,348
My appointment was with Harry.
You and I have none.

362
00:49:41,572 --> 00:49:43,424
Only one prize.

363
00:49:45,561 --> 00:49:50,253
Who is valuable to you.
- Harry McKenna's son.

364
00:49:50,867 --> 00:49:52,662
He knows that you have murdered his father?

365
00:49:55,485 --> 00:49:59,734
This must happen immediately.
Customers pay in good shape.

366
00:50:00,068 --> 00:50:02,311
I do not think it's too fast.

367
00:50:02,427 --> 00:50:06,467
I feel by your behavior and others
me very uncomfortable.

368
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:09,323
You're on a short line with this.

369
00:50:09,746 --> 00:50:13,061
The file has priority.

370
00:50:16,762 --> 00:50:18,893
I'll look into it.

371
00:50:47,043 --> 00:50:51,779
I am one with God.
God touches me and I touch his people.

372
00:50:51,896 --> 00:50:56,635
Andrew Vaughn, 45 years old.
Calls himself the new Messiah.

373
00:50:56,690 --> 00:50:58,980
Reverend Vaughn.
- Just Vaughn.

374
00:50:59,424 --> 00:51:02,298
I'm not a preacher.
Not endorsed by the secular religion.

375
00:51:02,414 --> 00:51:04,436
I'm beyond them, I'm Vaughn.

376
00:51:04,552 --> 00:51:08,208
He funneled millions to his churches, ministries ...

377
00:51:08,325 --> 00:51:12,125
to television programs.
In fact, he leads a cult.

378
00:51:12,241 --> 00:51:15,550
An adrenaline shot to the heart,
12 cc and within three minutes he is dead.

379
00:51:15,666 --> 00:51:19,022
Adrenaline is unreliable.
Soon he survives a heart attack.

380
00:51:19,138 --> 00:51:24,057
When the paramedics come,
first thing they do is administer epinephrine.

381
00:51:24,173 --> 00:51:26,749
It is toxic when combined.
- It's adrenaline.

382
00:51:26,789 --> 00:51:29,508
What is the probability that adrenaline did not kill him?

383
00:51:29,624 --> 00:51:31,346
Than does the trauma staff though.

384
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:34,279
CHICAGO, ILLINOIS

385
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:39,927
One evening he had a dedicated
from behind a bible study group.

386
00:51:40,471 --> 00:51:43,855
They found her body until two weeks later.

387
00:51:46,292 --> 00:51:50,473
The autopsy indicates abortion.
She told friends that it was his.

388
00:51:50,528 --> 00:51:53,482
Cost him 22 million to silence her.

389
00:51:54,358 --> 00:51:56,372
Let us put it round.

390
00:52:00,164 --> 00:52:02,783
Be blessed, following.

391
00:52:02,817 --> 00:52:05,868
Come here, sit down.

392
00:52:07,652 --> 00:52:10,723
You're new, how long are you here?
- Two weeks now.

393
00:52:10,758 --> 00:52:13,160
How old are you?
- 18.

394
00:52:13,195 --> 00:52:15,054
18.

395
00:52:43,388 --> 00:52:46,168
You could have an attractive person
can find.

396
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:48,593
He still eats.

397
00:52:48,955 --> 00:52:52,769
Soup, salad and bread.
And chocolate cake.

398
00:52:53,987 --> 00:52:56,472
Bishop, I'm hungry.

399
00:52:58,317 --> 00:53:03,309
That guy in the shop,
had regard to all his fingers.

400
00:53:03,985 --> 00:53:06,916
If you find link in your bread,
It was not me.

401
00:53:50,681 --> 00:53:52,564
It's safe.

402
00:54:11,854 --> 00:54:14,702
How do you feel Vaughn?
- How do you think.

403
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:17,011
He may be here any minute.

404
00:54:18,043 --> 00:54:20,665
If you say the devil.

405
00:54:35,215 --> 00:54:39,165
Give me something special,
I've been meaning to celebrate.

406
00:54:42,552 --> 00:54:44,452
I have spiritual work to do.

407
00:54:45,197 --> 00:54:47,327
The spirits are not favorable.

408
00:54:59,350 --> 00:55:03,763
He's a junkie.
- He gives him ketamine.

409
00:55:05,245 --> 00:55:09,032
Ketamine counteracts adrenaline.
This is not working.

410
00:55:20,745 --> 00:55:25,605
I am on my shoulder tapped by God.

411
00:55:25,926 --> 00:55:28,344
What do you do?

412
00:55:29,513 --> 00:55:31,395
I did not request.

413
00:55:31,512 --> 00:55:36,034
My shoulder was hit by
the sword of a king.

414
00:55:36,151 --> 00:55:40,942
He told me to take off.

415
00:55:42,094 --> 00:55:44,026
We have to pack.

416
00:55:44,107 --> 00:55:47,326
Wait.
- He comes here so returned.

417
00:55:47,748 --> 00:55:49,773
Put on your gloves.

418
00:55:51,203 --> 00:55:54,630
Hello?
Yes, that's it.

419
00:55:57,571 --> 00:55:58,998
Come on.

420
00:55:59,221 --> 00:56:03,348
You want to do this anyway.
This is Vaughn, his throat. Strangle him.

421
00:56:07,231 --> 00:56:12,732
If they think I'm paying full price
for a bedroom they love.

422
00:56:16,967 --> 00:56:19,668
How can I change the world?

423
00:56:19,785 --> 00:56:24,758
How can I be a better man
for my followers.

424
00:56:24,875 --> 00:56:28,978
Get out.
- Sometimes I wonder.

425
00:56:30,609 --> 00:56:35,965
Sometimes I wonder,
whether I have the strength and courage.

426
00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:41,948
I look in the mirror and think ...

427
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:46,265
Jesus.

428
00:56:47,595 --> 00:56:49,321
Ralph, come here.

429
00:56:49,550 --> 00:56:52,440
What is it?
- What is.

430
00:56:54,034 --> 00:56:56,229
Is he dead?
- Yes, he's dead.

431
00:56:56,345 --> 00:56:58,289
Stupid bastard.
I knew this would happen.

432
00:56:58,345 --> 00:57:01,833
Over everything, it should begin as soon as possible.

433
00:57:13,718 --> 00:57:15,954
Try to pick him up.

434
00:57:36,263 --> 00:57:38,951
Go look.

435
00:57:56,895 --> 00:57:59,350
Remove it from the wall.

436
00:58:01,919 --> 00:58:04,538
On the wall.

437
00:58:09,056 --> 00:58:11,235
Follow him.

438
00:58:11,397 --> 00:58:14,482
Blocking the exit.
Two people on the roof, now.

439
00:58:33,769 --> 00:58:36,440
There he is.

440
01:00:12,747 --> 01:00:15,721
Stay calm.

441
01:00:17,632 --> 01:00:19,182
They are looking for two men.

442
01:00:19,216 --> 01:00:22,690
A connected flight from Midway.
I fly from O'Hara and see you tomorrow at home.

443
01:00:24,218 --> 01:00:27,183
This way.

444
01:00:33,146 --> 01:00:36,705
Andrew Vaughn controversial
and religious person ...

445
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:38,442
is dead.

446
01:00:38,477 --> 01:00:44,649
The police is investigating the shooting,
The perpetrators have not yet been found.

447
01:01:06,755 --> 01:01:10,537
All five have been killed.

448
01:01:10,815 --> 01:01:13,448
You probably know people from that team.

449
01:01:28,389 --> 01:01:32,769
Terminal B.
- At the end, leaving about 15 minutes.

450
01:01:56,723 --> 01:01:59,521
When does this?
- About 15 minutes.

451
01:02:03,431 --> 01:02:05,020
That does not give us much time then.

452
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:11,652
What do you want?

453
01:02:13,491 --> 01:02:16,209
I want to know why you're alive.

454
01:02:16,769 --> 01:02:19,736
Last time I saw you
you had a bullet in your head.

455
01:02:20,432 --> 01:02:23,758
What really happened in Cape Town?

456
01:02:24,076 --> 01:02:26,992
Where's the rest of your team?
- They're dead.

457
01:02:31,041 --> 01:02:33,537
Dean has paid me a lot
the other murder.

458
01:02:33,714 --> 01:02:36,306
Said I had to put my death scene
and disappear.

459
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:38,094
Know what he told me more?

460
01:02:38,187 --> 01:02:41,310
Harry was suspicious
over a ruined surgery.

461
01:02:41,572 --> 01:02:45,391
He was about to betray.
It had to be processed.

462
01:02:47,431 --> 01:02:50,495
Did the right man for the job.

463
01:02:50,929 --> 01:02:53,438
Someone she could take.

464
01:02:54,149 --> 01:02:57,135
It is not the fact that you
They've killed it?

465
01:02:57,643 --> 01:03:01,915
But they were playing up so easily.
That is bothering you.

466
01:03:02,461 --> 01:03:05,022
Am I right?

467
01:05:34,897 --> 01:05:37,833
And?
- Not so good for your side.

468
01:05:38,252 --> 01:05:42,277
Those were my two best teams.
I think I should send more.

469
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:46,139
You save fuel.
I come to you.

470
01:05:53,293 --> 01:05:54,969
When are you coming home?

471
01:05:55,192 --> 01:05:57,167
I'm starving.
- Where are you?

472
01:05:57,919 --> 01:06:00,168
I'm in the living room.

473
01:06:00,525 --> 01:06:03,020
Sit on the bench.
- Okay.

474
01:06:03,544 --> 01:06:05,765
I assume you are not alone.

475
01:06:06,903 --> 01:06:08,808
There is a gun under the pillow left.

476
01:06:08,988 --> 01:06:11,231
Loaded and the safety catch is off.

477
01:06:11,539 --> 01:06:14,920
But I'm not left.
- Then you will die.

478
01:06:16,433 --> 01:06:19,155
Well, if I see you're here.

479
01:06:28,358 --> 01:06:30,860
I'm about five minutes.

480
01:06:40,858 --> 01:06:43,858
Who sent these guys?
- My employer.

481
01:06:45,284 --> 01:06:48,753
Grab the stuff from the top shelf,
and put it in the boat.

482
01:07:39,462 --> 01:07:41,868
Are we ready?

483
01:07:46,009 --> 01:07:48,203
Step.

484
01:08:05,823 --> 01:08:08,533
Do you ever think about the
people you killed?

485
01:08:11,409 --> 01:08:13,513
No.

486
01:08:13,933 --> 01:08:17,216
Have you ever killed someone you knew?

487
01:08:22,245 --> 01:08:24,090
Yes.

488
01:08:25,972 --> 01:08:28,638
Did it feel different?

489
01:08:31,753 --> 01:08:34,170
Not at that time.

490
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:45,407
A warning?
Time to prepare?

491
01:08:45,827 --> 01:08:48,993
I have time to ...

492
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:53,499
peace.

493
01:08:55,876 --> 01:08:57,956
There is no peace.

494
01:09:01,624 --> 01:09:04,895
So it is best that they do not know
you're coming.

495
01:09:11,616 --> 01:09:13,654
Yes.

496
01:09:14,830 --> 01:09:18,269
It does not matter
until they are dead and not you, right?

497
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:43,687
Hello, Finch.

498
01:09:49,190 --> 01:09:52,480
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

499
01:10:02,429 --> 01:10:05,080
I want you to listen to me.

500
01:10:05,236 --> 01:10:09,133
It does not matter who I hurt
do or die, you know?

501
01:10:12,334 --> 01:10:14,988
Please, no.

502
01:10:20,115 --> 01:10:22,492
You're gonna tell me what I want to know.

503
01:10:22,847 --> 01:10:25,246
Where's Dean?

504
01:10:38,045 --> 01:10:43,622
It's up to you how far I go.
Herein.

505
01:10:45,801 --> 01:10:48,169
Pulse.

506
01:10:48,762 --> 01:10:53,230
Elbow.
- Tell him what he wants to know.

507
01:11:01,688 --> 01:11:04,336
Okay, 300 Golden Plaza.

508
01:11:05,455 --> 01:11:08,219
300 Golden Plaza.
I swear there he is.

509
01:11:17,170 --> 01:11:19,580
You're going to miss a good dinner.

510
01:11:21,674 --> 01:11:24,425
Asshole.

511
01:11:35,245 --> 01:11:39,035
Yes.
- What was Harry's life worth?

512
01:11:41,316 --> 01:11:43,549
50 million.

513
01:11:44,377 --> 01:11:46,052
I'm going to do.

514
01:11:46,375 --> 01:11:51,341
Ten million to one's own choice,
within 24 hours.

515
01:11:51,796 --> 01:11:55,325
That's a good deal, it would take.
- Not interested.

516
01:11:56,058 --> 01:11:58,935
A murderer gets a conscience.

517
01:11:59,102 --> 01:12:01,811
This is a professional handicap,
Mr. Bishop.

518
01:12:02,234 --> 01:12:05,637
Harry dead things.
Pure and simple.

519
01:12:05,898 --> 01:12:08,389
Now is not that simple.

520
01:12:09,035 --> 01:12:13,160
No, because now I put a big price on your head.

521
01:12:14,209 --> 01:12:18,754
That if you look in the mirror,
your reflection you want to shoot.

522
01:12:18,859 --> 01:12:22,208
As long as you survive.
- You're a fool.

523
01:12:22,386 --> 01:12:24,822
You think you're with me earlier
than I do for you?

524
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:27,084
I al

525
01:12:31,849 --> 01:12:34,670
Where E is meeting?
- Up, sir.

526
01:12:34,787 --> 01:12:37,032
He is inside, get me the hell out of here.

527
01:13:32,098 --> 01:13:35,347
Have they found Bishop?
- Nothing yet.

528
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:40,871
Get out of that bus.
Walk, go by bus.

529
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:10,522
Go.

530
01:14:45,686 --> 01:14:48,486
Backward.

531
01:15:35,201 --> 01:15:38,093
Fuck you.

532
01:16:05,415 --> 01:16:07,689
What is the plan?

533
01:16:08,420 --> 01:16:10,358
Disappear.

534
01:16:10,635 --> 01:16:14,662
New identity, new profession.
- Together?

535
01:16:16,717 --> 01:16:19,160
That's up to you.

536
01:16:19,505 --> 01:16:23,715
What we do in bunk beds?
Camping in a wigwam?

537
01:16:29,591 --> 01:16:32,047
Want some water?

538
01:16:42,691 --> 01:16:45,348
I always ...

539
01:16:47,428 --> 01:16:52,120
had an anger in me.
Now you feel like ...

540
01:16:52,427 --> 01:16:56,934
I could give one place.
I would miss if I would quit.

541
01:17:05,658 --> 01:17:08,369
Many people out there who would pay ...

542
01:17:09,773 --> 01:17:12,490
and I think you wrong.

543
01:17:13,454 --> 01:17:16,951
Revenge is the problem.

544
01:17:35,622 --> 01:17:39,377
You want something?
- No.

545
01:17:56,838 --> 01:17:59,234
Last chance.

546
01:17:59,829 --> 01:18:02,703
I do not want.

547
01:18:07,513 --> 01:18:10,462
I'm sorry about what happened.

548
01:18:11,483 --> 01:18:15,942
You know me, it fascinates me.

549
01:21:10,191 --> 01:21:14,797
STEVE, IF YOU READ THIS,
YOU'RE DEAD! BISHOP.

550
01:21:44,475 --> 01:21:47,719
Victory loves preparation

551
01:21:52,382 --> 01:21:55,229
Look number two.

552
01:22:39,923 --> 01:22:47,511
