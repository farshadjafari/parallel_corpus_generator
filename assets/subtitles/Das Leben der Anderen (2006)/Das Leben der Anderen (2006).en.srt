1
00:00:23,904 --> 00:00:25,548
Stop, don't look forward.

2
00:00:30,609 --> 00:00:32,413
Keep walking.

3
00:00:36,314 --> 00:00:38,273
You should address him as 'sir'
when you get in.

4
00:00:40,224 --> 00:00:41,920
Come in.

5
00:00:43,588 --> 00:00:45,032
Have a seat.

6
00:00:47,885 --> 00:00:49,749
You may feel better if you put
your hands under your legs.

7
00:00:57,064 --> 00:00:58,855
Anything you would like to confess?

8
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,646
I didn't do anything.

9
00:01:02,881 --> 00:01:04,124
I don't know anything.

10
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:06,246
You didn't do anything?
You don't know anything?

11
00:01:07,946 --> 00:01:11,767
You thought the National Security
Agency would put people
in prison at random?

12
00:01:11,865 --> 00:01:13,878
No, I didn't.

13
00:01:13,893 --> 00:01:15,207
Even if it's true that you didn't
do anything,

14
00:01:15,915 --> 00:01:18,904
we could still arrest you on the ground
of your skepticism on our government.

15
00:01:21,608 --> 00:01:25,413
Let me help you with your memory:

16
00:01:26,229 --> 00:01:31,582
Your friend and neighbor, specifically,
flied to the Federal Republic
on September 28th.

17
00:01:32,019 --> 00:01:34,398
We have evidence that it was you
who helped him with fleeing the country.

18
00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:35,960
I know nothing about it.

19
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:40,384
He didn't tell me his plan.
I thought he was flying for business.

20
00:01:41,247 --> 00:01:45,286
Please detail what you have done
on September 28th then.

21
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,945
- They've written it down.
- I want to hear it again.

22
00:01:50,445 --> 00:01:54,091
I took the kids to the park
for a walk,

23
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:56,268
and ran into Markechner, my classmate
in high school,

24
00:01:56,915 --> 00:02:00,598
and we went to his place together,
listening to music, talking,
until it was very late.

25
00:02:01,417 --> 00:02:04,140
You can call him and confirm it.

26
00:02:04,747 --> 00:02:06,713
I can give you his number.

27
00:02:07,324 --> 00:02:10,129
From this clip it's easy for
you to find

28
00:02:10,652 --> 00:02:12,059
that he is trying to confront
his own country with his arrogance.

29
00:02:12,094 --> 00:02:15,295
It takes patience to play with him.
The next part is the interrogation,
which lasts about 40 hours.

30
00:02:16,285 --> 00:02:17,858
Let's move on.

31
00:02:23,657 --> 00:02:26,048
I want to sleep.
Let me sleep, please.

32
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:28,431
Sleep? You need to trade for it
with something.

33
00:02:30,643 --> 00:02:34,392
Please explain again what you did
on September 28th.

34
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:41,266
Please, let me sleep
for just one hour

35
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:44,268
Please state again what you did
on that day.

36
00:02:50,341 --> 00:02:52,281
Why does the interrogation have
to be so long?

37
00:02:52,623 --> 00:02:54,948
I think this is inhumane.

38
00:03:01,085 --> 00:03:06,952
An innocent man, having been
questioned so long for something
he didn't do,

39
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:09,614
he should either be in a rage
or suicidal,

40
00:03:10,382 --> 00:03:15,832
while a guilty person often refuse
to talk, or start to cry,

41
00:03:16,401 --> 00:03:18,092
because he knows exactly why
he is sitting there.

42
00:03:18,692 --> 00:03:23,960
The best way to tell whether
someone is guilty, is to question
him until he admits everything.

43
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,140
We met Markechner in the park,

44
00:03:28,165 --> 00:03:30,461
then we went to his place together,

45
00:03:33,453 --> 00:03:35,679
listened to the music and
stayed up late.

46
00:03:37,473 --> 00:03:42,357
I have his telephone number,
you can give him a call and he'll
tell you what I said was true.

47
00:03:43,693 --> 00:03:46,878
Is there anything interesting
to you in his answer?

48
00:03:48,401 --> 00:03:49,760
It's the same as what he said
at the first time.

49
00:03:50,616 --> 00:03:53,546
He hardly changed a word.

50
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:56,754
Because what really happened
would not change no matter how
you describe it.

51
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,895
But there is also the possibility
that he was lying.

52
00:03:59,258 --> 00:04:04,370
Because he might have practiced it
in his mind for a thousand times.
But under coercion, he won't hold for long.

53
00:04:05,597 --> 00:04:11,780
There are other techniques
for hard rocks like him.

54
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:17,644
If you can tell us the name
of the plane, you can go home to your
wife tonight,

55
00:04:20,034 --> 00:04:22,307
if not, it's the prison that's
waiting for you.

56
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,231
Is that what you want?

57
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,843
What's the name of the plane?
Who owns it?

58
00:04:34,798 --> 00:04:36,440
- Resker.
- Say it again, louder.

59
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:41,620
Risker.
It's Bernag Resker's plane.

60
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,652
Bernag Resker.

61
00:04:47,478 --> 00:04:49,622
Silence!

62
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:51,976
Silence!

63
00:04:52,438 --> 00:04:53,653
Listen.

64
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,547
Who knows what this sound is?

65
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:09,638
This is for the trained dogs,
a piece of cloth with the criminal's
odor on it.

66
00:05:09,673 --> 00:05:14,319
It comes from every interrogation,
and will be kept in a bottle forever.

67
00:05:19,443 --> 00:05:22,306
Wiretapping is a common technique
used in almost every socialist country

68
00:05:23,552 --> 00:05:25,856
Please never forget it.
Have a nice day.

69
00:05:31,736 --> 00:05:33,288
Good! It was really good.

70
00:05:36,457 --> 00:05:38,055
Bro,

71
00:05:38,441 --> 00:05:41,005
we haven't hanged out for what,
20 years?

72
00:05:44,433 --> 00:05:47,165
And now you are a professor.

73
00:05:49,163 --> 00:05:53,618
Good for you. And I'm doing good
too, of course.

74
00:05:54,172 --> 00:05:55,958
What do you need?

75
00:05:56,633 --> 00:05:59,101
You think I want something from you?

76
00:05:59,136 --> 00:06:01,569
- I'm inviting you to a play.
- A play?

77
00:06:02,332 --> 00:06:05,189
I heard that the minister of arts
will come too.

78
00:06:06,162 --> 00:06:09,152
To show the administration's
attitude to the artists, I think.

79
00:06:09,179 --> 00:06:11,170
It starts at 7 tonight.
We'll talk about it.

80
00:06:12,179 --> 00:06:18,412
The Lives of Others

81
00:06:25,803 --> 00:06:28,282
Minister Bruno Hempf is in the middle
of the third row.

82
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:33,397
He used to be a nobody in the
Ministry of Arts.

83
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:36,434
And he is not particularly interested
in attending all these events.

84
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:46,321
Georg Dreyman, he is a poet.

85
00:06:46,848 --> 00:06:51,052
He is as arrogant as
some of my students.

86
00:06:51,325 --> 00:06:52,770
Not only arrogant, but also one
of the right-wing.

87
00:06:53,692 --> 00:06:55,551
But he will lose his job soon.

88
00:06:56,042 --> 00:07:01,447
We suspect that a few writers have
been close to the Western Germany,
and he is one of them.

89
00:07:01,619 --> 00:07:03,558
The German Democratic Republic
is the best country in the world.

90
00:07:07,335 --> 00:07:09,524
It starts.

91
00:07:21,537 --> 00:07:24,536
What's wrong, my dear child?

92
00:07:24,571 --> 00:07:27,496
Marta, what happened? Tell me!

93
00:07:29,719 --> 00:07:30,973
He left me, Otto.

94
00:07:31,488 --> 00:07:34,347
Otto? How can you say that your
husband is dead?

95
00:07:34,382 --> 00:07:37,207
No, sisters, please trust me.

96
00:07:39,049 --> 00:07:41,756
He's dead already.

97
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,512
There is deep fear in his paintings.

98
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,537
I can see it,

99
00:07:52,012 --> 00:07:54,005
that terrifying love.

100
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:59,876
Why does this love feel so thorny?

101
00:08:03,188 --> 00:08:06,444
Elena, let's go.

102
00:08:46,865 --> 00:08:50,393
How do you think?
Are you interested?

103
00:08:50,428 --> 00:08:52,474
I'll watch him.

104
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:56,657
Watch him? This is totally
different from teaching.

105
00:08:56,692 --> 00:09:01,952
- We can use the best wiretappers.
- You have to risk your career.

106
00:09:01,987 --> 00:09:04,426
If you lose, you are shark meat.

107
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,236
I'll be downstairs for a second.

108
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,419
We have a lot to do at this moment,
including a series of bans
on the culture.

109
00:09:40,415 --> 00:09:42,746
Which party do you belong to?

110
00:09:42,781 --> 00:09:45,077
I think it doesn't matter,
Mr. minister.

111
00:09:45,112 --> 00:09:47,719
What matters is one's patriotism.

112
00:09:52,262 --> 00:09:54,275
How much do you know about this man?

113
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:57,894
Goerg Dreyman

114
00:10:02,497 --> 00:10:04,613
Maybe...

115
00:10:05,058 --> 00:10:06,083
Maybe what?

116
00:10:09,298 --> 00:10:13,535
Maybe this job is not as noble
as it seems.

117
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,973
It's such a pity that you are not
a secret agent.

118
00:10:19,008 --> 00:10:26,603
I hope you could make a perfect
plan for this one. We can talk
about it later.

119
00:10:27,549 --> 00:10:29,543
They have plenty of expectations
on you.

120
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:36,955
But this artist, he hides well.
It'll be tricky.

121
00:10:41,121 --> 00:10:44,930
Next Thursday all those felons
will attend a party at Dreyman's,

122
00:10:44,965 --> 00:10:48,719
for instance, reactionist writer Houser
and a few others. You should
plan everything carefully beforehand,

123
00:10:48,754 --> 00:10:52,474
using all your old tricks,
like wiretapping.

124
00:10:52,509 --> 00:10:56,071
Just keep an eye on his apartment,
don't try to follow him,

125
00:10:56,106 --> 00:11:01,242
and don't report before you
have gathered all the evidence.

126
00:11:05,056 --> 00:11:12,803
Once caught by us, he's dead.

127
00:11:15,106 --> 00:11:17,980
Good night, Mr. minister.

128
00:11:38,311 --> 00:11:39,593
What is he staring at us?

129
00:11:43,601 --> 00:11:45,666
What does he want?

130
00:11:46,368 --> 00:11:49,022
Is he one of your fans?

131
00:12:02,781 --> 00:12:08,809
Excuse me.
Sorry for the interruption,

132
00:12:09,411 --> 00:12:12,862
but I would like to say that it
was a fantastic night for the
art society.

133
00:12:13,557 --> 00:12:17,272
There is a famous quote:
"A poet is an engineer in the Eden."

134
00:12:17,317 --> 00:12:20,998
And Goerg Dreyman is one of our best
engineers in Democratic Republic.

135
00:12:24,383 --> 00:12:27,193
- What does he want?
- Be quiet and listen, Houser.

136
00:12:29,822 --> 00:12:36,288
I can't help giving him my compliment
again: Dreyman is a shining star among
the artists in Democratic Republic.

137
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:42,758
Next I wish Mrs. Dreyman's beauty
and acting skills will both grow.

138
00:12:47,592 --> 00:12:51,190
- Now I see what all this is about.
- Stay with me, please.

139
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:57,138
Please continue with the music.

140
00:12:57,516 --> 00:12:59,349
May I?

141
00:13:03,955 --> 00:13:07,415
- I love your plays.
- Thank you very much.

142
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:10,792
And I'm very interested in you.

143
00:13:10,827 --> 00:13:11,923
Yes, I mean it.

144
00:13:12,213 --> 00:13:15,719
Engineer in the Eden?
Do you really understand what it means?

145
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:17,907
Of course I do.

146
00:13:18,014 --> 00:13:21,164
I did throw a tons of bans
on cultural activities,

147
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:24,925
but Houser, I'm still crazy about arts.

148
00:13:26,133 --> 00:13:32,558
The government will protect its artists,
but in the meantime, dear Dreyman,
they have to repay their government.

149
00:13:33,131 --> 00:13:35,899
I'll dance with someone else
if politics is your only topic.

150
00:13:35,934 --> 00:13:38,667
- I'm ready.
- Too late, it's too late.

151
00:13:43,746 --> 00:13:48,980
- I have been following your plays.
- Yes, following is what you do, isn't it?

152
00:13:49,015 --> 00:13:52,740
- Houser!
- That was a long time ago.

153
00:13:52,775 --> 00:13:53,934
Schweiber.

154
00:13:54,936 --> 00:13:57,081
You are busy these days, aren't you?

155
00:13:57,116 --> 00:14:01,054
Your directing is not as good
as in the past.

156
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:02,896
Let's talk about it some other time.

157
00:14:02,931 --> 00:14:06,078
Please allow me to disagree.

158
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,012
You don't have to like my plays,

159
00:14:12,388 --> 00:14:15,660
but I do love this country.

160
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:22,100
Could you please leave politics
aside when you watch them?

161
00:14:22,135 --> 00:14:26,052
It's impossible for everyone
to share the same faith,

162
00:14:29,096 --> 00:14:34,232
but if one is truly loyal to his
faith in socialism,

163
00:14:34,864 --> 00:14:37,992
he won't change his mind no matter
what kind of plays he watches.

164
00:14:39,207 --> 00:14:41,900
- This is not something that can be banned.
- Would you like to have a try then?

165
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:48,118
I can certainly help you get an idea of
what a ban is like if you don't believe it.

166
00:14:53,584 --> 00:14:56,188
Okay, let me put it this way:

167
00:14:56,223 --> 00:15:00,177
If my work is good to the point
of making you nervous,

168
00:15:00,212 --> 00:15:02,987
then it worths it, even if it's banned.

169
00:15:03,706 --> 00:15:07,009
- I think you should consider my advice.
- I don't need it.

170
00:15:07,336 --> 00:15:11,739
Just as you said,
I believe that a good man's love and faith

171
00:15:12,315 --> 00:15:15,631
won't be changed by one play.

172
00:15:16,055 --> 00:15:22,797
Dreyman, you can write whatever
you want, and people's mind won't
be changed so easily.

173
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:29,774
- Have you decided on what to do?
- People listen to their conscience,

174
00:15:31,272 --> 00:15:33,283
not the nature of their jobs.

175
00:15:39,696 --> 00:15:45,110
- People should never lose hope.
- Of course, you can only become
well off when you have hope.

176
00:15:45,518 --> 00:15:49,217
Sometimes hope can be
the only thing that keeps people alive.

177
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:06,603
Tomorrow we'll make sure everything
works fine technically.

178
00:16:07,526 --> 00:16:11,029
Most importantly,
there can't be any dead zone for
our device in his house.

179
00:16:11,585 --> 00:16:13,044
It is here?

180
00:16:16,293 --> 00:16:18,918
Good night.

181
00:17:48,879 --> 00:17:53,979
You guys are good, pals.

182
00:19:44,134 --> 00:19:45,743
20 minutes.

183
00:21:38,945 --> 00:21:44,678
Mrs. Meineke, if you tell anyone,
you won't see your family again
for the rest of your life.

184
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:50,803
Understood?

185
00:21:51,203 --> 00:21:52,412
yes.

186
00:21:55,252 --> 00:21:58,455
Make a note on Mrs. Meineke's records.

187
00:22:10,325 --> 00:22:12,641
Happy Thursday.

188
00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:17,672
How time flies!
It's great to see you again.

189
00:22:34,949 --> 00:22:37,314
- How are you doing?
- Not too bad.

190
00:22:38,773 --> 00:22:43,054
- They don't make noise
like this all the time.
- I know, only on Thursdays.

191
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:45,605
Yeah.

192
00:22:49,383 --> 00:22:53,685
- I miss the past.
- This doesn't sound like a good
beginning.

193
00:22:55,923 --> 00:23:00,254
- I've had this uneasy feeling since
last night's premiere.
- Good for you. It keeps you energetic.

194
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:13,960
I can't stand this country any more.
There are no human rights, nor
freedom of speech.

195
00:23:17,134 --> 00:23:20,391
This whole system drives me mad.

196
00:23:21,289 --> 00:23:25,454
But on the other hands, it's
the same system that inspires us
to write,

197
00:23:25,892 --> 00:23:29,209
to write about how people live
in this country, real lives.

198
00:23:31,235 --> 00:23:34,516
And that's real masterpiece,
coming from our conscience.

199
00:23:39,053 --> 00:23:40,219
But I really hate it like this,
Dreyman.

200
00:23:41,437 --> 00:23:48,847
I hope I could be a writer again
in my next life.

201
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:55,022
What would you do about this play
if you are the director?

202
00:23:57,057 --> 00:24:02,431
There are so many constraints,
you can't dig in as much as you want.

203
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:09,237
Being alive is so meaningless.

204
00:24:11,948 --> 00:24:16,591
Albert, I think I'm in trouble.
It's the minister in charge of the arts,
minister Hempf.

205
00:24:18,252 --> 00:24:22,911
He threatened to ban my plays.

206
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:30,009
Would it be terrible?

207
00:24:30,044 --> 00:24:32,778
I don't know what a ban is like.

208
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:38,880
Really?

209
00:24:39,566 --> 00:24:41,266
It's great.

210
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:28,046
The guests will come soon.
We can have a drink after they leave.

211
00:25:31,547 --> 00:25:33,719
But there are still a lot of
problems.

212
00:25:39,583 --> 00:25:42,613
Georg, you have to be strong.
I need you,

213
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:46,785
- no matter what's gonna happen
to you in the future.
- You are my partner for my whole life.

214
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:51,147
- You are mine too.
- Then we still have 50 years.

215
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:53,760
Or maybe 40, right?

216
00:25:54,493 --> 00:25:58,078
I hope you didn't forget it. You
promised to tie up a Montblanc
by yourself on your birthday.

217
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,195
I did, but I don't have one.

218
00:26:05,113 --> 00:26:06,257
No more excuse.

219
00:26:09,862 --> 00:26:12,572
- Are you kidding?
- You said you didn't want books
as presents anymore.

220
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,517
But I doubt you can do it yourself.

221
00:26:19,094 --> 00:26:22,747
Of course I can. I know how to
do it from the day I was born.

222
00:26:24,434 --> 00:26:28,127
Don't forget I'm gonna liberate
our people on my own.

223
00:26:29,068 --> 00:26:32,210
Then you have to fasten this one
on your own first.

224
00:26:41,954 --> 00:26:45,170
Those women! I really can't do this.

225
00:27:00,469 --> 00:27:04,278
Mrs. Meineke, can you
come here for a second?

226
00:27:11,514 --> 00:27:14,582
Could you please tie my neck
tie for me?

227
00:27:19,103 --> 00:27:21,287
I'll thank you for the rest of my life.

228
00:27:26,477 --> 00:27:30,906
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

229
00:27:32,029 --> 00:27:33,398
Done?

230
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:41,448
Wonderful! It's perfect.
I'll just make it look more natural.

231
00:27:42,278 --> 00:27:46,168
May I ask you to keep secret on this?
It's a secret between us.

232
00:27:58,209 --> 00:28:01,439
Nice! I really thought you wouldn't
be able to do it.

233
00:28:02,194 --> 00:28:04,396
When did you learn that?

234
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:07,014
I learned everything when I was young.

235
00:28:12,311 --> 00:28:13,797
Our first guest is here.

236
00:28:18,879 --> 00:28:21,651
Our sweet little doorbell is broken again.
Get the door, will you?

237
00:28:21,686 --> 00:28:23,120
Okay, I will.

238
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:52,577
- This is Our present.
- Following your instruction,

239
00:28:52,612 --> 00:28:55,345
- "No books any more".
- Thank you.

240
00:28:57,825 --> 00:29:00,733
- Can I join you guys?
- Sure. Long time no see.

241
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,317
I'll get some drinks.

242
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:15,403
What's going on?
Why is he sitting there alone?

243
00:29:15,761 --> 00:29:18,277
He hardly talked to anyone.
He just sat there and read.

244
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:34,433
This is my present.

245
00:29:38,048 --> 00:29:42,425
- Did you just come here to read?
- It's the Brecht.

246
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:55,510
These people don't have the thrist
for freedom, do they?

247
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,742
They don't? Then why are you here?
What can we do in this environment?

248
00:30:01,428 --> 00:30:05,583
People get used to everything
around us.

249
00:30:05,618 --> 00:30:08,437
Yes, they can now accept what used
to be unbearable.

250
00:30:10,477 --> 00:30:13,682
Changes are no longer anticipated.

251
00:30:17,379 --> 00:30:21,353
You are my favorite director.
Hang on, we should talk.

252
00:30:21,388 --> 00:30:25,328
Let me explain to you the background
for the characters in this play.

253
00:30:26,516 --> 00:30:28,125
Despair, yes, exactly.

254
00:30:28,146 --> 00:30:31,968
But what should they do?

255
00:30:33,445 --> 00:30:35,978
The National Security can't
gag everybody.

256
00:30:36,013 --> 00:30:38,365
- I don't think they can.
- What the hell are you talking about?

257
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,189
Houser!
What's up?

258
00:30:40,903 --> 00:30:43,535
Schweiber, I'm really sorry.
My friend is a little drunk.

259
00:30:46,585 --> 00:30:49,457
What's with you? Don't you know
that he's working for the National
Security now?

260
00:30:49,492 --> 00:30:52,067
No, Houser.
You don't know him well.

261
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,833
You are being idealistic,
you know that?

262
00:31:13,868 --> 00:31:15,783
Since when have you been escaping
the reality?

263
00:31:15,818 --> 00:31:18,796
They transformed you, all these
people. You are now used to your
life under despotism.

264
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,373
If that's true, you don't even
deserve to be alive.

265
00:31:22,979 --> 00:31:28,119
Don't see me again until you want
to end all this.

266
00:31:56,727 --> 00:32:00,996
- Some people still gave you books.
- Was my request too impolite?

267
00:32:01,549 --> 00:32:05,239
Look at this fork.
Isn't it beautiful?

268
00:32:05,861 --> 00:32:07,558
That's for making salad.

269
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:11,065
No matter what it's for,
it's beautiful.

270
00:32:13,035 --> 00:32:16,391
Look at this.
I'll write with this pen.

271
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:19,470
It's from Thomas. I wouldn't
count on his taste for presents.

272
00:32:20,979 --> 00:32:23,255
Some of these are pretty useful.

273
00:32:37,294 --> 00:32:41,085
- This is from Albert.
- Then you are going to love it.

274
00:32:45,294 --> 00:32:48,085
"Sonata from Good Men"

275
00:33:10,294 --> 00:33:19,085
"11:04pm: 'Lazlo' and CMS unpacked
the presents. We speculated that
they had sex afterwards"

276
00:33:21,995 --> 00:33:23,647
You are late!

277
00:33:24,537 --> 00:33:29,485
I'm sorry. Something happened
just before I left home.

278
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,157
So I'm late for four minutes.
I apologize.

279
00:33:39,841 --> 00:33:43,942
They've started doing that?
These artists! What can't they do?

280
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:50,946
I have to listen to this, how
their sex lives are different
from ordinary people.

281
00:33:54,402 --> 00:33:55,969
See you tomorrow at 11am.

282
00:34:03,673 --> 00:34:09,024
Albert Jerska, an old customer.
He's been banned to the core.

283
00:34:09,059 --> 00:34:11,034
I knew they were close.
come on, let's go lunch.

284
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:26,209
"Volleyball game
at 7pm tonight."

285
00:34:26,244 --> 00:34:28,369
I suggest we sit there.

286
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,239
No matter where we sit,
socialism must let us eat.

287
00:34:37,704 --> 00:34:43,058
There is one thing I want you
to know, that is

288
00:34:45,036 --> 00:34:47,937
it was the Minister's car that
sent Mrs. Dreyman home last night.

289
00:34:50,647 --> 00:34:54,313
We don't know the details yet,

290
00:34:54,348 --> 00:35:02,080
but he didn't deny it when I
talked to him last time.

291
00:35:03,407 --> 00:35:08,041
Once you find anything between
the minister and Mrs. Dreyman,
just tell me, don't write it down.

292
00:35:09,822 --> 00:35:14,893
What you are listening to not only
determines my future, but yours too,

293
00:35:16,585 --> 00:35:17,610
if we do find something.

294
00:35:23,757 --> 00:35:28,335
Why should we cover up for him?
This is not our style.

295
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:32,918
Personal affairs can be powerful
weapons for our rival parties.

296
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:37,081
He and us are all communists,
You don't want disgrace your
own party, do you?

297
00:35:37,877 --> 00:35:43,399
I have a new joke, it's like this:
Erich (General Secretary) went into
his office in the morning.

298
00:35:43,434 --> 00:35:48,629
He opened the window, saw the sun,
and said...what's wrong?

299
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:56,280
Sorry, I'm just...I...

300
00:35:56,315 --> 00:36:02,365
It's all right, comrade.
It's okay to tell jokes about
leaders of our country.

301
00:36:03,642 --> 00:36:05,230
I can tell a ton of them myself.

302
00:36:08,412 --> 00:36:09,514
Go on, please.

303
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:16,471
Okay. Erich, our general secretary,

304
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,917
he said to the sun: "Good morning,
my dear sun."

305
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,033
"Good morning, my dear sun."
Is that what he said?

306
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,033
And the sun answered:
"Good morning."

307
00:36:30,999 --> 00:36:35,302
At noon he asked again:"Good day,
my dear sun?"

308
00:36:35,666 --> 00:36:39,656
And the sun said:"Good day."
After work in the evening, Erich
greeted again:

309
00:36:39,691 --> 00:36:43,646
"Good evening, my dear sun."
But the sun didn't answer this time.

310
00:36:44,678 --> 00:36:48,626
So he asked once again:"Good evening,
dear sun, what's up?"

311
00:36:48,661 --> 00:36:51,586
The sun said:"You bastard, don't
'What's up' me, I've been tolerant
for a whole day!"

312
00:36:57,568 --> 00:36:59,875
Your name?

313
00:37:00,358 --> 00:37:01,787
ID number? Department?

314
00:37:02,982 --> 00:37:04,086
Me?

315
00:37:07,009 --> 00:37:09,136
My name is Stiller.

316
00:37:09,288 --> 00:37:12,095
Adolph Stiller. I'm in the
First Informational Section.

317
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:16,174
You don't have to hear from me
how much damage you just did to
your own career, do you?

318
00:37:19,224 --> 00:37:24,810
- Well...I just...
- You just what?

319
00:37:24,845 --> 00:37:27,512
This kind of jokes will blemish
our party.

320
00:37:27,547 --> 00:37:30,041
And you are working in the National
Security Agency.

321
00:37:30,076 --> 00:37:33,383
Why don't you just go to his office
and tell the minister that joke?

322
00:37:44,758 --> 00:37:50,700
Yeah, it kills me!
Good story, but needs work.

323
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:54,001
What's the difference between
Erich and a telephone?

324
00:37:54,036 --> 00:37:58,596
Not at all. You just grab and
dial for both.

325
00:38:37,049 --> 00:38:43,049
- Where are you going?
- Home.
- Night.

326
00:38:51,296 --> 00:38:52,506
Get in the car!

327
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,688
You didn't forget about our date
on every Thursday, did you?

328
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:02,688
Is your poet having his birthday again?

329
00:39:05,571 --> 00:39:08,751
Get in the car! come on!

330
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,226
I believe you understand
what's good for you.

331
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,730
So please think about it and
weigh the options in your mind.

332
00:39:56,325 --> 00:39:59,830
Maybe it is your coldness

333
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:02,506
that makes me so crazy about you.

334
00:40:12,352 --> 00:40:14,256
Are you out of your mind?

335
00:40:16,809 --> 00:40:19,332
If you want to get home early,

336
00:40:20,382 --> 00:40:26,554
don't fight. I'll send you
home early if you behave yourself.

337
00:41:18,449 --> 00:41:20,225
You'd better see it with your
own eyes.

338
00:41:36,629 --> 00:41:38,789
I'm coming!

339
00:41:47,115 --> 00:41:48,429
Silly woman!

340
00:42:10,086 --> 00:42:15,287
See you next Thursday.
Let's go.

341
00:44:29,598 --> 00:44:31,324
Are you asleep?

342
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,888
Hold me, please.

343
00:45:04,366 --> 00:45:06,019
How are you, sir?

344
00:45:07,916 --> 00:45:10,062
You are five minutes late again.

345
00:45:51,335 --> 00:45:55,322
Good evening. Eleventh Floor,
the door on the right.

346
00:45:55,357 --> 00:45:57,895
Open the door.

347
00:46:02,344 --> 00:46:06,594
- How did you get up here?
- I know your name.

348
00:46:09,024 --> 00:46:10,792
I was able to get in just by
telling your name, can you
believe it?

349
00:46:11,755 --> 00:46:12,896
No, I can't.

350
00:46:26,348 --> 00:46:30,382
How was it? Did you like it?

351
00:46:36,914 --> 00:46:39,936
- Stay for the night.
- I can't.

352
00:46:39,971 --> 00:46:42,650
I have another customer.

353
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:46,220
I work on reservations.

354
00:46:52,473 --> 00:46:55,903
It's 1:30 already, what kind of
customer is that at this time?

355
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:59,067
None of your business.

356
00:47:01,257 --> 00:47:03,640
You can reserve for an hour longer
next time.

357
00:47:03,675 --> 00:47:04,772
See ya.

358
00:48:08,598 --> 00:48:12,223
Georg, have you heard about Houser?

359
00:48:13,197 --> 00:48:14,486
No, what's about him?

360
00:48:14,521 --> 00:48:17,523
National Security took
his passport, he can't go
abroad to attend the workshop.

361
00:48:20,279 --> 00:48:22,035
It's because he's too proud, you know?
The Security finally had to do something.

362
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:25,075
A man who doesn't know how to
protect himself. He deserves it.

363
00:48:26,965 --> 00:48:29,549
A writer should be more conscious
about the reality.

364
00:48:33,965 --> 00:48:42,549
"'Lazlo' supported the forbidance
on Houser's travel abroad."

365
00:48:50,787 --> 00:48:53,425
Have you seen my anthology?

366
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:54,493
The one I just finished writing.

367
00:48:56,115 --> 00:48:57,761
Isn't it on your desk?

368
00:48:59,235 --> 00:49:01,635
This is weird. I can't find it.

369
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:07,250
* Brecht *
"Everyday in September the early fall
was blue;

370
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:13,480
"Those young upright trees reaching
for the sky, like love they flourished
and grew;

371
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:20,004
"Above us floated the fair clear sky;

372
00:49:20,039 --> 00:49:22,871
"which a cotton-white cloud
was walking through;

373
00:49:22,906 --> 00:49:26,897
"And with faith in your heart
it shall never leave you."

374
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,876
- Yes?
- Georg? This is Vagner.

375
00:49:48,911 --> 00:49:50,589
What's up?

376
00:49:52,315 --> 00:49:57,694
Have you heard?
Jerska killed himself.

377
00:50:04,754 --> 00:50:06,403
Georg?

378
00:50:08,252 --> 00:50:10,373
I'm sad too.

379
00:51:53,707 --> 00:51:57,647
I've been thinking about the last
conversation between Jerska and me.

380
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:03,679
I should listen to him and
make some change.

381
00:52:08,877 --> 00:52:14,096
If he could hear this song I'm playing,

382
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:17,740
if he really can,
he would know what I'm gonna do.

383
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:52,131
Do you really Work for the National
Security Agency?

384
00:52:56,679 --> 00:52:59,659
Do you know what National Security
Agency is for?

385
00:53:00,293 --> 00:53:05,494
Yes. They are bad guys, they took
my dad.

386
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:07,560
Did they?

387
00:53:07,983 --> 00:53:09,881
What's the name of your...?

388
00:53:13,233 --> 00:53:14,905
My what?

389
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:18,336
Your ball.
What's the name of your ball?

390
00:53:19,103 --> 00:53:22,486
You are strange.
Why would people name their balls?

391
00:53:28,443 --> 00:53:32,565
Minister, this is my present
for you,

392
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:35,636
The best wiretappers,
and the top operators.

393
00:53:36,986 --> 00:53:38,841
- We can hear every sound in every corner.
- You must find what we need from Dreyman.

394
00:53:40,757 --> 00:53:44,169
Jerska killed himself, and these
artists will do something.

395
00:53:48,402 --> 00:53:49,633
It was good to see you.

396
00:53:57,794 --> 00:54:03,239
You should work on this, we're gonna
start watching Houser and others.

397
00:54:05,677 --> 00:54:09,871
The Minister really wants to
go for it now.

398
00:54:09,906 --> 00:54:13,451
It's giving me headaches.

399
00:54:13,486 --> 00:54:21,477
- What's new with him and Mrs. Dreyman?
- If I didn't hear it wrong, they are
going out tomorrow night.

400
00:54:21,512 --> 00:54:25,589
Good, good.
But don't spend too much time on
this love story.

401
00:54:26,988 --> 00:54:28,402
We have our own business to mind.

402
00:54:29,098 --> 00:54:31,514
Don't forget that.

403
00:54:42,719 --> 00:54:45,696
I've been queasy tonight.

404
00:54:46,212 --> 00:54:48,960
I don't want to stay home by myself,
and I can't write anything.

405
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:55,048
After Jerska's death,
I don't feel like writing anymore.

406
00:54:57,236 --> 00:54:59,030
And I start to fear that you
would leave me.

407
00:55:00,910 --> 00:55:02,795
Don't be like a child.

408
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:07,528
- I have to go out tonight anyway.
- Where?

409
00:55:09,066 --> 00:55:11,646
An old schoolmate is coming,

410
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:13,629
- And we are gonna...
- You are not lying to me, are you?

411
00:55:16,357 --> 00:55:19,121
- Is that true?
- What do you mean?

412
00:55:19,485 --> 00:55:24,141
I know everything.

413
00:55:26,429 --> 00:55:28,461
I know where you are going.

414
00:55:31,109 --> 00:55:32,986
And I beg you not to.

415
00:55:34,188 --> 00:55:36,440
You don't have to do this.

416
00:55:37,259 --> 00:55:39,503
You don't have to.

417
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,171
I know you are doing this for me,

418
00:55:51,372 --> 00:55:53,475
and for acting, which you can
never give up.

419
00:55:55,407 --> 00:55:56,736
Trust me,

420
00:55:59,569 --> 00:56:01,603
Christa Maria,

421
00:56:02,076 --> 00:56:04,272
You are a great artist,

422
00:56:06,505 --> 00:56:10,222
you always are. I know it.

423
00:56:11,937 --> 00:56:13,575
And your audience know it too.

424
00:56:13,610 --> 00:56:17,688
There is no need for you to
please anyone.

425
00:56:17,723 --> 00:56:20,047
Don't go.

426
00:56:20,082 --> 00:56:21,820
Don't go to him.

427
00:56:25,654 --> 00:56:32,629
No, I don't need to do this.
I did everything in vain.

428
00:56:35,845 --> 00:56:38,792
But what about you?

429
00:56:38,984 --> 00:56:41,845
Don't you need it?
Do you want to give up your freedom?

430
00:56:43,529 --> 00:56:45,649
You can live in your writing,

431
00:56:45,684 --> 00:56:47,004
you can still write whatever in
your mind. Then why didn't you?

432
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:52,699
Because you know they will destroy you.
People can't just live on faith.

433
00:56:55,497 --> 00:57:01,121
What can we do?
What should we do?

434
00:57:04,669 --> 00:57:06,489
Do you want to be the next Jerska?

435
00:57:07,557 --> 00:57:09,214
I don't.

436
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,667
So I have to go now.

437
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:17,775
You're making a point.
I can't make you change your mind.

438
00:57:21,058 --> 00:57:22,402
But I beg you,

439
00:57:22,437 --> 00:57:26,559
don't go.
Cherish yourself.

440
00:57:26,594 --> 00:57:28,428
I'm here, sir.

441
00:57:29,532 --> 00:57:32,136
What were you listening to?
You were so concentrated.

442
00:57:34,762 --> 00:57:36,103
Okay, it's my turn.

443
00:57:36,138 --> 00:57:39,015
I can't take the blame to make
you work overtime.

444
00:57:49,015 --> 00:57:52,460
Where are you going?

445
00:57:53,739 --> 00:57:56,479
To see one of my old schoolmates.

446
00:58:02,134 --> 00:58:04,222
I'll write down the details.
You shall see them tomorrow morning.

447
00:58:04,621 --> 00:58:06,313
Don't worry.

448
00:58:09,481 --> 00:58:11,797
Good night.

449
00:59:02,203 --> 00:59:04,165
There are plenty of seats inside.

450
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:14,955
Just myself.

451
00:59:17,713 --> 00:59:20,327
Give me a cup of vodka.

452
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:22,551
Okay.

453
00:59:29,081 --> 00:59:31,219
Can you play "The Smile" instead?

454
00:59:45,205 --> 00:59:47,359
Wine, please.

455
01:00:37,836 --> 01:00:38,938
How do you do, madam?

456
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:42,020
Please don't bother me.
Leave me alone.

457
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,653
Mrs. Sieland.

458
01:00:44,688 --> 01:00:47,577
Do we know each other?

459
01:00:47,612 --> 01:00:50,111
You don't know me,
but I know you well.

460
01:00:53,001 --> 01:00:54,826
People love you,

461
01:00:54,861 --> 01:00:56,711
because you are real.

462
01:01:01,344 --> 01:01:05,917
- Actresses can't be real.
- But you are.

463
01:01:11,182 --> 01:01:13,768
I've seen you on stage,

464
01:01:13,803 --> 01:01:19,215
and you were just yourself,

465
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:24,147
like who you are now.

466
01:01:27,928 --> 01:01:29,290
You think you know who I am?

467
01:01:30,032 --> 01:01:31,743
I'm one of your audience.

468
01:01:37,381 --> 01:01:40,327
- I have to go.
- Where are you going?

469
01:01:42,747 --> 01:01:45,426
I'm going to see an old schoolmate
of mine.

470
01:01:45,461 --> 01:01:49,440
Really? You become a different
person when you're lying.

471
01:01:51,428 --> 01:01:53,831
- Do I?
- Yes.

472
01:02:06,046 --> 01:02:10,140
Am I still the Christa Maria you know?

473
01:02:12,899 --> 01:02:18,310
Would you leave someone who is even
more important than your own life?

474
01:02:22,525 --> 01:02:25,241
Would you give away your body for art?

475
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:28,445
Give away your body for art?

476
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:31,071
That's not a good deal.

477
01:02:32,105 --> 01:02:34,537
You are the greatest actress
I've ever seen.

478
01:02:35,843 --> 01:02:36,947
Don't you think so?

479
01:02:42,421 --> 01:02:43,665
You are a very good man.

480
01:03:18,949 --> 01:03:26,413
"They brawled about whether Mrs. Dreyman
should go and see her schoolmate,

481
01:03:26,984 --> 01:03:30,418
"and she went at last.
'Lazlo' stayed at home in bitterness.

482
01:03:30,453 --> 01:03:36,614
"About 20 minutes later,
Mrs. Dreyman came back,

483
01:03:36,615 --> 01:03:37,615
"suprisingly,
not only for 'Lazlo', but for me too.

484
01:03:39,027 --> 01:03:44,039
"He was very happy.
And then the two of them made love.

485
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:55,280
"She told him she would never leave
him again. He said:"Now I have my
inspirations back."

486
01:03:56,087 --> 01:03:59,548
"It is guessed that we will have
a new play soon.

487
01:04:00,191 --> 01:04:04,763
"Due to all that happened last week,
he's been behind on his script.

488
01:04:05,422 --> 01:04:07,955
"Why did she change so suddenly?

489
01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:12,120
"I can tell that she's even more
in love with 'Lazlo' now.

490
01:04:12,917 --> 01:04:14,707
"The flame of love lights up again."

491
01:04:15,550 --> 01:04:21,987
Sir, I...
They were asleep, so I also...

492
01:04:23,178 --> 01:04:24,499
Nice report.

493
01:04:27,495 --> 01:04:29,157
You think so?

494
01:04:46,425 --> 01:04:48,558
I've never been so sad in my life.

495
01:04:52,455 --> 01:04:53,856
Me neither.

496
01:05:00,782 --> 01:05:03,138
Never was a regime similar to socialism
in the history.

497
01:05:03,315 --> 01:05:08,886
The Central keeps an eye on everything
about everybody's life.

498
01:05:08,921 --> 01:05:12,244
On average, a man buys 2.3 pairs
of shoes each year,

499
01:05:12,279 --> 01:05:14,846
reads 3.2 books.

500
01:05:14,881 --> 01:05:21,196
And in each year there are 6,743 students
graduating with straight As.

501
01:05:21,561 --> 01:05:24,080
But there is one statistics that
goes unpublished,

502
01:05:24,115 --> 01:05:29,594
which might have been calculated
into the natural deaths.

503
01:05:29,708 --> 01:05:33,128
If you call the National Security
Agency and ask them,

504
01:05:33,129 --> 01:05:36,129
How many people kill themselves
for being suspected as related to
the Western Germany,

505
01:05:36,313 --> 01:05:41,539
they won't tell you a word,

506
01:05:41,574 --> 01:05:43,624
and they'll write down your name
carefully.

507
01:05:43,659 --> 01:05:45,982
This is all for the country's safety.

508
01:05:46,017 --> 01:05:51,047
All those dead people, are for the
country's safety and well being.

509
01:05:51,082 --> 01:05:56,172
German Democratic Republic
has stopped counting the number
of suicides since 1977.

510
01:05:56,207 --> 01:05:59,335
Suicides as we know,

511
01:05:59,571 --> 01:06:03,160
they were already for the best.

512
01:06:03,195 --> 01:06:07,103
Because they couldn't stand their lives
like that, without bleeding,

513
01:06:07,138 --> 01:06:09,939
without passion.
Death was all they could choose.

514
01:06:09,974 --> 01:06:13,052
Death was their only hope.

515
01:06:13,087 --> 01:06:19,224
Since 9 years ago when we stopped to count
suicides, only one country in Europe has
higher death counts than Eastern Germany:

516
01:06:19,679 --> 01:06:20,819
Hungary.

517
01:06:20,854 --> 01:06:25,352
And then we all head for
the same destination: socialism.

518
01:06:25,387 --> 01:06:28,407
Among all these people the most
distinguished was Jerska,

519
01:06:28,442 --> 01:06:30,096
a great director.

520
01:06:30,131 --> 01:06:32,168
What I'm writing today is the
story about him.

521
01:06:37,671 --> 01:06:42,821
- I've laid down the framework for my script.
- We should believe in the statistics from
National Security.

522
01:06:51,296 --> 01:06:54,226
My apartment is not sound-proof.

523
01:06:57,395 --> 01:06:59,413
Let's play some music for them.

524
01:07:02,345 --> 01:07:03,350
How about in my place?

525
01:07:10,345 --> 01:07:13,350
"3pm, Chrenmal Park"

526
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:21,506
It's okay now.

527
01:07:26,346 --> 01:07:30,780
- Look, there's a stalker.
- Invite him over.

528
01:07:33,314 --> 01:07:34,739
what did you write?

529
01:07:35,552 --> 01:07:36,632
Read this.

530
01:07:47,133 --> 01:07:48,394
You want to publish this?

531
01:07:49,412 --> 01:07:52,241
That would be great.
Can you help me?

532
01:07:57,883 --> 01:07:59,344
Did Christa know about it?

533
01:08:00,149 --> 01:08:01,343
no

534
01:08:02,712 --> 01:08:03,861
alright, I will help you

535
01:08:03,896 --> 01:08:07,274
But don't tell her anything

536
01:08:07,309 --> 01:08:08,471
what?

537
01:08:08,506 --> 01:08:10,525
Georg, it is for her own safety

538
01:08:11,972 --> 01:08:13,033
I will contact the editor of "The Mirror"

539
01:08:13,303 --> 01:08:15,985
If anyone else knows it
we will be in big trouble

540
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:17,563
Do you know Hessenstein?

541
01:08:17,598 --> 01:08:20,003
I know this name, but that's it

542
01:08:21,568 --> 01:08:23,952
You must meet him.
You can publish this, but only anonymously

543
01:08:25,253 --> 01:08:28,741
It is to protect you and Christa.
Unless you escape to Western Germany

544
01:08:30,293 --> 01:08:32,018
It is so cold out here

545
01:08:32,912 --> 01:08:34,048
Let's go to my place

546
01:08:35,860 --> 01:08:37,723
There is no secret agent

547
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:43,103
- no wiretapping, no surveillance
- How do you know?

548
01:08:43,583 --> 01:08:45,201
My place is "clean"

549
01:08:46,721 --> 01:08:49,606
but to make sure...

550
01:08:52,298 --> 01:08:54,817
I have a suggestion to see if your place is under surveillance or not

551
01:08:55,737 --> 01:09:00,075
I can ask my uncle Frank to help.
He is coming from Western Germany this Saturday to visit me

552
01:09:00,110 --> 01:09:03,581
He has a brand new golden Mecedes

553
01:09:03,616 --> 01:09:05,990
My script sounds good, right?

554
01:09:06,025 --> 01:09:09,310
yes, I totally agree

555
01:09:09,496 --> 01:09:12,303
it is pretty nice from all aspects

556
01:09:12,338 --> 01:09:14,118
I don't understand, script like this
can't be published here?

557
01:09:14,153 --> 01:09:16,759
God completely forgets us

558
01:09:17,625 --> 01:09:22,547
We can submit it to some magazine in western Germany

559
01:09:23,890 --> 01:09:28,130
Definitely not so many restrictions there

560
01:09:30,839 --> 01:09:33,767
Where are you going to stay, uncle?

561
01:09:33,802 --> 01:09:35,512
Andrea Street

562
01:09:35,547 --> 01:09:41,433
He told me to meet you guys

563
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:46,588
We can talk about the script in more details

564
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:50,446
Maybe we will hear some good news from him

565
01:09:52,686 --> 01:09:54,251
you know, Paul has being watched by the National Security

566
01:09:54,286 --> 01:09:59,110
that agent must be watching him

567
01:10:01,047 --> 01:10:03,013
ok, I have to go

568
01:10:03,048 --> 01:10:07,082
Lads, come on
nothing can stop us, right?

569
01:10:23,194 --> 01:10:24,534
do you think it's gonna work?

570
01:10:29,649 --> 01:10:31,282
hello, this is public telephone
are you looking for someone?

571
01:10:33,561 --> 01:10:36,762
hello?

572
01:10:38,387 --> 01:10:39,708
strange

573
01:10:44,379 --> 01:10:45,991
you are playing with me

574
01:11:09,585 --> 01:11:12,728
- Georg speaking
- we overreacted

575
01:11:14,281 --> 01:11:15,585
Nobody followed you?

576
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:20,008
no, seems the situation isn't that bad

577
01:11:20,043 --> 01:11:21,909
- ok, I am going back to Western Germany
- I really appreciate for everything you did

578
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:26,850
- It's nothing.

579
01:11:26,885 --> 01:11:30,884
- I'm glad you are not under surveillance
- alright, thanks again

580
01:11:30,919 --> 01:11:34,584
- ok, see you later
- bye

581
01:11:44,315 --> 01:11:47,137
if someone asks about what we are doing
what should we say?

582
01:11:53,375 --> 01:11:55,366
we say...just like what we said just now

583
01:11:56,922 --> 01:12:00,900
we are working on a play

584
01:12:01,820 --> 01:12:04,101
to celebrate the 40th anniversary of DDR?

585
01:12:04,426 --> 01:12:06,283
yes

586
01:12:06,469 --> 01:12:07,980
that's what we planed

587
01:12:11,638 --> 01:12:16,244
I can't believe the National Security is so lame

588
01:12:19,733 --> 01:12:23,737
I thought they were at least something!

589
01:12:27,384 --> 01:12:28,716
you will see!

590
01:12:38,384 --> 01:12:51,716
"7:32pm: Nothing else to report."

591
01:13:02,448 --> 01:13:05,519
Sir, listen to this

592
01:13:08,894 --> 01:13:12,165
it's reasonable if the number of
people committing suicide is
less than 37 in a certain period.

593
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:16,092
but so far the known number is 77
you must explain it, in details,

594
01:13:16,127 --> 01:13:17,238
more specifically

595
01:13:18,699 --> 01:13:20,466
I want to be more literarily

596
01:13:20,501 --> 01:13:24,410
- not just as a reporter to reveal something
- The article itself is great

597
01:13:24,445 --> 01:13:27,185
but I think with specific numbers
it is easlier to be accepted by the public

598
01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:29,115
then what do you suggest?

599
01:13:30,570 --> 01:13:33,732
- Something is going on
- yes, you are right

600
01:13:34,330 --> 01:13:36,671
what do you know?

601
01:13:42,421 --> 01:13:44,612
They are writing a new play

602
01:13:46,407 --> 01:13:48,266
for the 40th anniversary of DDR

603
01:13:49,209 --> 01:13:52,038
It does not sound like that to me

604
01:13:54,853 --> 01:13:56,297
then what do you think?

605
01:13:57,367 --> 01:13:59,903
I don't know, but definitely not a script

606
01:14:01,362 --> 01:14:03,744
my comrade, you think too much

607
01:14:04,867 --> 01:14:06,256
you are not an intellectual

608
01:14:06,770 --> 01:14:11,076
- me? no, I am not
- then stop your nonsense

609
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:17,109
what I need from you is technical support
so stop asking me stupid questions!

610
01:14:18,847 --> 01:14:20,675
Do not try to do what I'm supposed to do!

611
01:14:20,710 --> 01:14:23,637
I am sorry, I should get going

612
01:14:24,516 --> 01:14:30,425
have a nice day,
and good luck with your work

613
01:14:35,393 --> 01:14:36,544
then I have to rewrite it

614
01:14:38,272 --> 01:14:41,108
I will give you time for that
and also provide you with necessary help

615
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:43,367
two weeks, is that enough?

616
01:14:44,481 --> 01:14:46,816
so we can publish it before
the 40th anniversary

617
01:14:46,851 --> 01:14:48,360
keep the title

618
01:14:51,423 --> 01:14:52,611
Christa is back?

619
01:14:54,224 --> 01:14:55,266
Georg?

620
01:14:57,182 --> 01:15:00,138
Christa, this is Mr.Hessenstein

621
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:04,069
- I'm Christa-Maria
- such an honor to meet you at last

622
01:15:04,736 --> 01:15:06,396
what are you doing?

623
01:15:07,312 --> 01:15:11,545
we are working on a script for the 40th anniversary of DDR

624
01:15:11,961 --> 01:15:13,373
can you make it in time?

625
01:15:13,873 --> 01:15:15,903
That's why we need to discuss

626
01:15:15,938 --> 01:15:18,998
- Am I the leading actress?
- That is exactly what I am going to ask

627
01:15:19,033 --> 01:15:22,858
Christa, you want to play Lenin
or his beloved mother?

628
01:15:22,893 --> 01:15:24,484
you can choose either one.

629
01:15:25,645 --> 01:15:28,393
I think I'd better leave you guys alone
I am going to take a nap

630
01:15:37,027 --> 01:15:38,923
you should be careful

631
01:15:39,927 --> 01:15:43,918
the less people know, the better.
the National Security is desperate

632
01:15:49,710 --> 01:15:53,140
I also brought you some presents

633
01:15:57,334 --> 01:15:58,910
as cute as the cake

634
01:15:59,398 --> 01:16:01,063
I have a typewriter

635
01:16:01,073 --> 01:16:08,767
the National Security will
search everything here

636
01:16:08,802 --> 01:16:12,467
it's not for fun
it's also for Paul's safety

637
01:16:14,881 --> 01:16:18,750
unfortunately only red ink is available for this type of pocket-sized typewriter

638
01:16:18,785 --> 01:16:21,617
you can switch to black after you finish the red.

639
01:16:21,652 --> 01:16:23,272
who knows if that's gotta happen

640
01:16:23,307 --> 01:16:27,326
you have to hide it whenever necessary

641
01:16:28,224 --> 01:16:31,013
- ok, I promise to keep it safe
- it is a serious matter

642
01:16:32,066 --> 01:16:36,504
I don't want you all get into trouble because of this typewriter

643
01:16:36,539 --> 01:16:39,317
only the three of us know about this typewriter

644
01:16:41,669 --> 01:16:43,703
are you sure your appartment is safe?

645
01:16:43,910 --> 01:16:45,185
yes

646
01:16:46,868 --> 01:16:50,594
even if every street in DDR is full of secret agents, this house is still safe

647
01:16:51,242 --> 01:16:53,605
good, then let's wait for the hugh impact from this article

648
01:16:56,715 --> 01:16:58,937
This bottle of wine is real!

649
01:17:00,412 --> 01:17:05,035
Cheers! For revealing the truth
of DDR to every German!

650
01:17:11,546 --> 01:17:14,899
- cheers!
- This is a historical moment

651
01:17:14,934 --> 01:17:17,074
cheers

652
01:17:33,873 --> 01:17:35,958
I need to see him.
I am Wiesler

653
01:17:38,671 --> 01:17:41,158
sorry, if you don't have an appointment
I'm afraid...

654
01:17:41,833 --> 01:17:43,155
I said...

655
01:17:43,821 --> 01:17:47,280
if they still have problems

656
01:17:47,721 --> 01:17:49,513
then temporarily close the church

657
01:17:49,548 --> 01:17:52,736
we can arrest the priest

658
01:17:52,737 --> 01:17:56,499
do it now, don't let me teach you

659
01:17:57,245 --> 01:17:58,867
so, any news?

660
01:17:59,778 --> 01:18:01,312
look at this book

661
01:18:02,865 --> 01:18:08,110
"Studies on Ideology and Political Ideas"

662
01:18:08,469 --> 01:18:09,594
isn't that academic?

663
01:18:10,923 --> 01:18:12,589
Look at this.

664
01:18:14,085 --> 01:18:18,986
National Security Information Section
Professor Wiesler

665
01:18:21,497 --> 01:18:26,548
Wonderful! Allow me to read one paragraph on page 230

666
01:18:27,150 --> 01:18:29,095
What a masterpiece

667
01:18:29,130 --> 01:18:33,358
for instance, people under surveillance can be divided into 5 categories

668
01:18:34,353 --> 01:18:35,910
for example, Dreyman
the guy that you are watching

669
01:18:35,945 --> 01:18:39,738
is in the 4th category, historical type
very difficult to deal with

670
01:18:40,004 --> 01:18:42,886
I tell you this because you are my friend

671
01:18:43,394 --> 01:18:46,854
for people in this category, you can't play with them step by step

672
01:18:48,072 --> 01:18:51,850
you have to get rid of him, or find some fatal clues before he notices that he is under surveillance

673
01:18:52,539 --> 01:18:55,181
but be careful
don't let him notice

674
01:18:55,216 --> 01:18:58,289
don't have any contact with him

675
01:18:59,061 --> 01:19:03,428
don't be emotional,
don't reveal any personal information, even in the report

676
01:19:03,463 --> 01:19:05,805
don't leave him any trace that he might write into his book in the future

677
01:19:06,878 --> 01:19:09,369
you will be free in 10 months

678
01:19:10,385 --> 01:19:11,467
completely free

679
01:19:12,034 --> 01:19:13,487
I'd like to see that!

680
01:19:13,522 --> 01:19:19,160
you know what's my experience?

681
01:19:19,812 --> 01:19:21,426
most of the 4th category
people I know are gone

682
01:19:21,461 --> 01:19:24,841
no matter what kinds of artists they are

683
01:19:25,712 --> 01:19:28,359
they can feel the presure in this way

684
01:19:29,254 --> 01:19:30,806
you know what

685
01:19:31,463 --> 01:19:32,835
it is a gift for them!

686
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:36,851
what are you doing here?

687
01:19:37,529 --> 01:19:40,061
anything new on Dreyman?

688
01:19:41,205 --> 01:19:43,517
I think it's time...

689
01:19:44,141 --> 01:19:45,150
it's time for what?

690
01:19:46,012 --> 01:19:49,569
I mean, I can deal with it myself

691
01:19:50,297 --> 01:19:52,995
I want to do wiretapping alone

692
01:19:53,030 --> 01:19:56,242
- I don't trust the other guy
- you don't trust him

693
01:19:57,805 --> 01:19:59,645
are you sure you can manage yourself?

694
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:03,379
- you don't want anyone else to know it?
- Does Lazlo belong to the 4th category?

695
01:20:04,657 --> 01:20:07,350
the more people know
the more dangerous

696
01:20:11,489 --> 01:20:13,575
then I will ask Url to stop

697
01:20:13,610 --> 01:20:16,098
I prefer to work alone

698
01:20:17,330 --> 01:20:18,426
why?

699
01:20:19,330 --> 01:20:21,118
I think we're getting there

700
01:20:22,158 --> 01:20:24,581
I can handle it by myself

701
01:20:25,578 --> 01:20:29,753
I can follow Lazlo

702
01:20:30,653 --> 01:20:32,877
he might also work outside

703
01:20:37,203 --> 01:20:38,921
ok, I grant your request

704
01:20:42,837 --> 01:20:44,284
but you must accomplish this mission

705
01:20:54,659 --> 01:20:58,868
right now, I am busy with this church thing

706
01:20:58,903 --> 01:21:01,163
write a report for me on this

707
01:21:01,595 --> 01:21:04,431
make change on the reasons accordingly

708
01:21:09,115 --> 01:21:10,746
wait

709
01:21:13,565 --> 01:21:14,595
one more thing

710
01:21:15,513 --> 01:21:18,826
we are not at school, what we do is not for a high score

711
01:21:18,861 --> 01:21:20,278
it is for the people

712
01:21:38,862 --> 01:21:41,565
agents watch everything on the street,
just like mad dogs

713
01:21:42,041 --> 01:21:44,273
on average, a man buys 2.3 pairs of shoes each year

714
01:21:44,274 --> 01:21:47,257
reads 3.2 books

715
01:21:47,816 --> 01:21:51,146
and there are 6,743 students
graduating with straight As

716
01:22:02,816 --> 01:22:20,146
"5:00pm: 'Lazlo' read Houser and Wallner
another act of the anniversary play."

717
01:22:52,816 --> 01:22:58,146
"Dental Clinic"

718
01:24:00,633 --> 01:24:03,748
- we are not working on a script
- you don't have to explain

719
01:24:04,725 --> 01:24:06,832
but I must tell you

720
01:24:07,166 --> 01:24:09,064
I don't want to hear

721
01:24:10,062 --> 01:24:12,987
it might upset your friends if you tell me

722
01:24:15,392 --> 01:24:16,995
I just want to stay with you

723
01:24:18,362 --> 01:24:20,112
no matter what you do

724
01:25:02,636 --> 01:25:07,200
the relationship between Eastern and Western Germany becomes tense, the latest "The Mirror" published an article

725
01:25:07,235 --> 01:25:09,381
written by an anonymous writer from Eastern Germany

726
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:14,910
this article investigates the suicide status in DDR

727
01:25:14,945 --> 01:25:19,066
the most striking part is it reveals

728
01:25:19,101 --> 01:25:22,067
the suicide of the famous director Jerska

729
01:25:22,505 --> 01:25:25,494
after being banned for 5 years

730
01:25:25,529 --> 01:25:28,418
Jerska committed suicide
on March 5th this year

731
01:25:28,453 --> 01:25:33,144
since 1977, DDR government has
never released the number of suicides

732
01:25:33,398 --> 01:25:36,883
so far, Hungary is the only country with a higher number of suicide cases

733
01:25:38,263 --> 01:25:40,358
General secretary, please let me explain

734
01:25:40,458 --> 01:25:42,840
yes, we have been watching him

735
01:25:44,539 --> 01:25:49,259
we have already contacted our agent at "The Mirror"
but we could not find the original manuscript

736
01:25:52,006 --> 01:25:55,185
we can speculate from the typewriter

737
01:25:57,947 --> 01:26:00,341
general secretary, I will let you know immediately when I find something.

738
01:26:09,667 --> 01:26:11,751
Andria, get me a technician

739
01:26:12,175 --> 01:26:15,849
if we want to speculate through the typweriter

740
01:26:16,420 --> 01:26:20,866
with the level of techniques we have, it's impossible to make it.

741
01:26:20,901 --> 01:26:25,147
very likely, this typewirter is made abroad

742
01:26:27,105 --> 01:26:30,752
- we don't have this kind of typewriter?
- no, we don't

743
01:26:31,227 --> 01:26:33,580
what about the people who has close contact with the western? like director Hauser

744
01:26:33,876 --> 01:26:37,893
in principle, only reporters know this kind of machine

745
01:26:37,928 --> 01:26:42,258
- but for most reporters...
- that's enough, what else?

746
01:26:44,175 --> 01:26:46,764
this typewriter has a special code

747
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:52,358
- Georg Dreyman?
- it is possible, but normally he would hand-write it first

748
01:26:52,393 --> 01:26:56,786
then type it, that is his general writing order

749
01:26:59,953 --> 01:27:03,176
how big is this typewriter?

750
01:27:03,211 --> 01:27:06,318
it's the smallest in the world

751
01:27:06,353 --> 01:27:10,106
19cm by 19cm

752
01:27:11,582 --> 01:27:13,388
the size of a book?

753
01:27:16,804 --> 01:27:18,462
ok, you can go now

754
01:27:22,601 --> 01:27:23,711
goodbye, comrade

755
01:27:28,601 --> 01:27:31,711
"The Mirror--DDR's Secret Suicide Statistics"

756
01:27:35,758 --> 01:27:37,954
Andria, get me through Hauptmann

757
01:27:38,758 --> 01:27:48,954
"4:00pm: The group is tired from
lots of writing."

758
01:28:00,887 --> 01:28:03,620
- Please
- Hauptmann, have you read the article about suicide?

759
01:28:04,039 --> 01:28:05,403
the one on The Mirror?
yes, I read it

760
01:28:05,602 --> 01:28:06,724
how did you know?

761
01:28:08,417 --> 01:28:10,848
Hauser made three calls to discuss it

762
01:28:12,265 --> 01:28:16,148
it is extremely important.
your career and mine depend on it

763
01:28:17,313 --> 01:28:21,146
you know what is behind this?
what do you think?

764
01:28:22,929 --> 01:28:26,251
I think Dreyman didn't write it
it is not possible

765
01:28:29,023 --> 01:28:34,479
last week, our agent followed Hessenstein
the editor of The Mirror

766
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:37,741
they lost him near Dreyman's appartment

767
01:28:37,776 --> 01:28:41,511
the 6th group are a bunch of idiots

768
01:28:41,546 --> 01:28:44,209
does he know Dreyman?
did they contact before?

769
01:28:45,186 --> 01:28:48,360
- did I write that in my report?
- no, you didn't

770
01:28:49,803 --> 01:28:53,736
then who wrote that article?
our future is fucked

771
01:28:54,635 --> 01:28:56,259
I will call you later

772
01:29:03,166 --> 01:29:04,629
shit

773
01:29:20,286 --> 01:29:21,628
come on in

774
01:29:35,451 --> 01:29:38,340
brief me your surveillance

775
01:29:39,052 --> 01:29:41,154
- how did The Mirror get it?
- but we have been watching him

776
01:29:41,717 --> 01:29:43,375
what about my relationship with that woman?

777
01:29:44,204 --> 01:29:46,371
- you know that too?
- yes

778
01:29:48,171 --> 01:29:52,521
can your men keep it?

779
01:29:53,025 --> 01:29:55,312
don't worry, it is all taken care of

780
01:29:55,664 --> 01:29:57,381
from now on, we could only trust ourselves

781
01:29:59,809 --> 01:30:03,991
arrest her and question her,
Christa-Maria Sieland.

782
01:30:05,930 --> 01:30:08,489
she must have known something

783
01:30:10,582 --> 01:30:13,947
no matter what you get, please release her afterwards

784
01:30:14,875 --> 01:30:17,928
anyway, I want to see her on stage

785
01:30:21,948 --> 01:30:23,796
you may go.

786
01:30:29,596 --> 01:30:30,892
close the door!

787
01:30:32,406 --> 01:30:35,934
Mrs.Sieland? Please come with us

788
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:40,561
let's go!

789
01:30:59,757 --> 01:31:01,043
come on!

790
01:31:02,465 --> 01:31:05,617
comrade Sieland, you are quite famous

791
01:31:07,629 --> 01:31:09,588
such a pity

792
01:31:10,232 --> 01:31:11,755
your performance is excellent

793
01:31:13,090 --> 01:31:15,181
and you are quite tall!

794
01:31:15,998 --> 01:31:17,723
sit down

795
01:31:25,102 --> 01:31:28,721
do you know why you are here?

796
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:34,822
tell me, please

797
01:31:35,970 --> 01:31:39,389
what can I do for you?

798
01:31:40,789 --> 01:31:46,147
- for the national security?
- too late

799
01:31:47,728 --> 01:31:51,757
I know almost all the artists
I can provide you with a lot of useful information

800
01:31:51,758 --> 01:31:54,992
I turly believe you can
but I am not interested

801
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:08,085
there must be something else that I can help

802
01:32:10,495 --> 01:32:13,106
otherwise why would you keep me here?

803
01:32:15,544 --> 01:32:19,562
but you've already...
how should I put this?

804
01:32:20,116 --> 01:32:22,878
you married a stupid man

805
01:32:23,631 --> 01:32:26,168
therefore you lost a lot of freedom that you deserved

806
01:32:29,339 --> 01:32:31,609
what can you suggest?

807
01:32:33,275 --> 01:32:35,618
nothing

808
01:32:46,048 --> 01:32:47,620
there is one thing that could help you

809
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:52,349
you know a lot of writers and artists

810
01:32:53,396 --> 01:32:59,065
do you know the article that published last week in The Mirror?

811
01:32:59,771 --> 01:33:01,575
the article about writers' suicide?

812
01:33:53,039 --> 01:33:54,675
hello, please open the door!

813
01:34:02,664 --> 01:34:03,819
open the door!

814
01:34:08,988 --> 01:34:10,899
let Maltz open the door by force

815
01:34:11,558 --> 01:34:14,227
don't give him any time

816
01:34:14,558 --> 01:34:16,438
Maltz

817
01:34:19,144 --> 01:34:21,259
it's unnecessary to do it by force

818
01:34:22,375 --> 01:34:25,060
- what do you want?
- The National Security needs to search the house

819
01:34:25,095 --> 01:34:26,663
an important mission

820
01:34:27,679 --> 01:34:30,029
help yourself!

821
01:34:31,090 --> 01:34:34,454
Maltz, Mutter, bed room and corridor
Galcy, Bale, follow me to the bath room and balcony

822
01:34:34,489 --> 01:34:38,189
Thomas, you guys to the living room and the study
let's go

823
01:35:26,891 --> 01:35:28,856
what did you burn?

824
01:35:30,117 --> 01:35:31,490
some useless manuscript

825
01:35:37,288 --> 01:35:39,774
is it an academic book published in Western Germany?

826
01:35:41,152 --> 01:35:43,672
the author gave it to me as a birthday present

827
01:35:46,769 --> 01:35:49,779
- have you started?
- yes, as planned

828
01:35:53,645 --> 01:35:58,074
there is nothing, except some Western Germany newspapers and books

829
01:36:00,441 --> 01:36:03,188
- we did not find the target
- search every corner

830
01:36:04,399 --> 01:36:06,710
we did.
do you want us to continue?

831
01:36:13,131 --> 01:36:15,347
- Should we continue on searching?
- let your men leave

832
01:36:17,754 --> 01:36:22,476
this is our address
if you have anything to confess, please come to us

833
01:36:23,601 --> 01:36:25,674
I'd better tidy this up first

834
01:36:47,935 --> 01:36:48,949
yes, please

835
01:36:48,984 --> 01:36:52,194
Wiesler, come to my office tomorrow morning at nine.

836
01:36:56,939 --> 01:37:00,139
Good, I think Christa-Maria sold you out

837
01:37:00,770 --> 01:37:03,320
she sold you out, then hid herself somewhere

838
01:37:05,855 --> 01:37:06,889
she didn't know anything

839
01:37:07,592 --> 01:37:08,744
what if she knew?

840
01:37:09,591 --> 01:37:12,043
she was not there when we discussed last time

841
01:37:15,968 --> 01:37:17,549
she won't tell even if she knew

842
01:37:19,485 --> 01:37:20,662
she won't

843
01:37:27,059 --> 01:37:30,096
if you are right
if she comes back herself

844
01:37:30,819 --> 01:37:32,699
I will take care of it

845
01:37:38,467 --> 01:37:40,456
I have an appointment with Colonel Grubitz

846
01:37:41,945 --> 01:37:45,485
agent XX/7

847
01:38:01,821 --> 01:38:03,659
come in

848
01:38:08,110 --> 01:38:09,212
have a seat

849
01:38:16,110 --> 01:38:17,212
And?

850
01:38:20,394 --> 01:38:22,259
what's going on?

851
01:38:22,294 --> 01:38:24,233
you ask me?

852
01:38:26,934 --> 01:38:29,351
you suspect Dreyman?

853
01:38:30,992 --> 01:38:32,767
he is good at plays

854
01:38:37,181 --> 01:38:38,799
do you have any proof?

855
01:38:42,097 --> 01:38:43,800
follow me

856
01:38:56,600 --> 01:39:00,342
I guess she doesn't know anything

857
01:39:01,844 --> 01:39:04,624
but we can dig up some valuable information eventually

858
01:39:05,238 --> 01:39:07,104
this is your last chance

859
01:39:08,673 --> 01:39:10,518
bring the suspect

860
01:39:15,204 --> 01:39:16,898
do you still remember which side you are on?

861
01:39:20,844 --> 01:39:23,637
- yes
- then I will give you one last chance

862
01:39:47,675 --> 01:39:49,403
Sir, do you want me present?

863
01:39:50,144 --> 01:39:53,206
this is classified, get out

864
01:39:59,404 --> 01:40:02,856
- are you executive officer?
- write that down!

865
01:40:03,955 --> 01:40:05,163
then execute me

866
01:40:20,972 --> 01:40:22,714
only 10 hours left

867
01:40:24,392 --> 01:40:26,572
no, to be accurate, 9.5 hours

868
01:40:27,378 --> 01:40:32,043
do you want them to change the leading actress because of some accident?

869
01:40:34,081 --> 01:40:37,242
this will be the last time for the audience to hear your name

870
01:40:39,252 --> 01:40:40,264
is that what you want?

871
01:40:43,542 --> 01:40:46,178
as long as you cooperate

872
01:40:47,792 --> 01:40:49,055
there was no article

873
01:40:50,019 --> 01:40:52,458
no typewriter, I made them up

874
01:40:54,286 --> 01:40:55,850
I hope they weren't

875
01:40:56,884 --> 01:40:58,787
if someone investigates it

876
01:40:59,952 --> 01:41:03,689
you will spend at least 2 years in prison for perjuring.

877
01:41:06,885 --> 01:41:08,558
Dreyman will be arrested anyway

878
01:41:09,379 --> 01:41:10,864
even without your testimony

879
01:41:13,306 --> 01:41:16,720
we've already gethered enough evidence to convict him

880
01:41:20,107 --> 01:41:22,436
you'd better think for yourself

881
01:41:24,511 --> 01:41:27,992
you have no idea how many people have gone j-cat in this place

882
01:41:32,062 --> 01:41:35,699
- you believe in public opinion?
- you believe in public opinion?

883
01:41:36,288 --> 01:41:38,387
only he would say something like this

884
01:41:42,670 --> 01:41:45,213
think about it,
what has this country done for you?

885
01:41:47,294 --> 01:41:48,788
your entire life is granted by this country

886
01:41:49,761 --> 01:41:53,338
it's time to return the favour
you will get what you deserve

887
01:41:56,498 --> 01:41:59,350
tell me, where is the typewriter?

888
01:42:01,027 --> 01:42:02,966
Dreyman wouldn't be arrested for this

889
01:42:03,579 --> 01:42:05,391
I'll let you go immediately

890
01:42:06,069 --> 01:42:08,689
we will protect you

891
01:42:10,268 --> 01:42:12,910
if there is enough time, you can even go home first

892
01:42:14,742 --> 01:42:17,205
and appear on stage tonight as scheduled

893
01:42:19,808 --> 01:42:21,079
stage, lights

894
01:42:23,255 --> 01:42:24,997
and the audience who love you

895
01:42:34,235 --> 01:42:36,280
tell me, where did he hide it?

896
01:42:46,315 --> 01:42:47,376
Spit it out

897
01:42:51,687 --> 01:42:53,374
it is in our appartment

898
01:42:56,990 --> 01:43:03,947
in the joint between bedroom and corridor

899
01:43:07,496 --> 01:43:11,171
there is one board that could be taken off

900
01:43:23,418 --> 01:43:26,748
do you mean here? Please mark it

901
01:43:56,116 --> 01:43:59,845
you can get your stuff back
you must be very tired

902
01:43:59,880 --> 01:44:07,137
this is a reward for serving your country

903
01:44:29,361 --> 01:44:31,153
Mr. Habuna

904
01:44:31,477 --> 01:44:33,606
have you seen Hauptmann?

905
01:44:33,641 --> 01:44:35,081
he left after the interrogation

906
01:44:35,558 --> 01:44:39,822
He did?
Good. That was quick.

907
01:44:56,302 --> 01:44:59,821
you still want to go home?
what if she is there?

908
01:45:00,449 --> 01:45:02,955
if she comes back, what is gonna happen?

909
01:45:02,990 --> 01:45:05,301
have you ever thought about what you are going to do?

910
01:45:06,150 --> 01:45:08,221
no, I don't think she will betray me

911
01:46:11,031 --> 01:46:14,610
- Christa?
- don't, I haven't had showers for 2 days

912
01:46:14,645 --> 01:46:16,647
I must take a shower

913
01:46:33,979 --> 01:46:37,380
- why did you leave by yourself?
- should I wait for your to pick me up?

914
01:46:37,415 --> 01:46:39,087
- they are both at home?
- yes

915
01:46:41,390 --> 01:46:42,666
this is today's wiretapping report

916
01:46:43,741 --> 01:46:46,871
hope it is the last day for this mission

917
01:47:07,412 --> 01:47:10,151
why didn't you call me?

918
01:47:11,938 --> 01:47:13,791
- what?
- why didn't you call me?

919
01:47:14,881 --> 01:47:16,214
we went to the countryside

920
01:47:18,604 --> 01:47:20,833
can you pass me the soap?

921
01:47:25,332 --> 01:47:27,960
National Security agents were here, they searched the entire place

922
01:47:29,172 --> 01:47:30,227
who were here?

923
01:47:32,092 --> 01:47:34,209
National Security, open the door!

924
01:47:35,227 --> 01:47:36,392
stay here

925
01:47:44,845 --> 01:47:47,965
comrade Dreyman, we are DDR National Security agents

926
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:51,869
you must've spent a lot of time tiding up last night

927
01:47:52,341 --> 01:47:54,712
start with the study

928
01:48:03,918 --> 01:48:06,136
search every book, page by page

929
01:48:24,826 --> 01:48:26,737
what's this?

930
01:48:29,568 --> 01:48:31,632
this board looks so unstable

931
01:48:37,319 --> 01:48:40,570
Would there be any secret
hidden underneath?

932
01:48:53,972 --> 01:48:56,082
excuse me, I have to open it by force

933
01:49:11,347 --> 01:49:12,741
this bitch is such a liar!

934
01:49:43,633 --> 01:49:48,260
I won't forget what you did to me

935
01:49:48,295 --> 01:49:50,636
stop talking, you will be fine

936
01:49:50,671 --> 01:49:53,412
I moved the typewriter to somewhere else

937
01:50:03,164 --> 01:50:06,802
forgive me, forgive me

938
01:50:06,837 --> 01:50:11,068
forgive me, forgive me

939
01:50:37,425 --> 01:50:40,944
pull back, it's over.

940
01:50:55,373 --> 01:50:59,835
Mr.Dreyman, the search is over.
we found nothing

941
01:51:01,080 --> 01:51:02,517
I am sorry

942
01:51:04,661 --> 01:51:06,263
let's go

943
01:52:03,173 --> 01:52:05,917
you know, this mission has failed

944
01:52:06,940 --> 01:52:08,225
your wiretapping career is over

945
01:52:09,534 --> 01:52:12,058
I will transfer you to letter surveillance section

946
01:52:13,880 --> 01:52:17,797
all you have to do is open all the envelopes
and wait for them to be inspected

947
01:52:19,052 --> 01:52:20,447
this will be your job for the next 20 years

948
01:52:21,299 --> 01:52:22,880
20 years!

949
01:52:24,390 --> 01:52:25,462
a fucking long time

950
01:52:42,192 --> 01:52:44,524
4 Years and 7 Months Later

951
01:53:02,192 --> 01:53:03,524
the Wall fell!

952
01:53:08,547 --> 01:53:09,719
the Wall fell!

953
01:53:15,888 --> 01:53:19,646
It's a festival here.
young people is flooding across the Wall

954
01:53:19,681 --> 01:53:22,847
they are hailing and hugging each other.
it is unbelievable

955
01:53:22,882 --> 01:53:27,969
we are now reporting from Berlin.
Nov. 9th, 1989, a day that will be
marked in the history

956
01:53:28,004 --> 01:53:30,553
this is a live report from our reporters

957
01:53:52,004 --> 01:53:56,553
2 Years Later

958
01:53:58,797 --> 01:54:01,768
my dear child, what happened?

959
01:54:01,803 --> 01:54:04,208
my lover died

960
01:54:06,906 --> 01:54:12,936
lover? I saw him this morning
he was full of energy

961
01:54:12,971 --> 01:54:16,815
no, sisters, believe me

962
01:54:17,748 --> 01:54:22,759
he is dead, I know when he died

963
01:54:22,794 --> 01:54:26,681
the sun just arose and was shining on him

964
01:54:28,164 --> 01:54:31,565
there was deep fear on his face
I saw that

965
01:54:31,566 --> 01:54:34,643
that terrifying love

966
01:54:37,794 --> 01:54:39,966
why does this love feel so thorny?

967
01:54:41,719 --> 01:54:45,528
Elena, let's go home

968
01:54:46,715 --> 01:54:48,664
I want to change everything

969
01:54:57,685 --> 01:54:59,174
recalled something, right?

970
01:55:04,283 --> 01:55:07,219
I came out for the same reason

971
01:55:09,740 --> 01:55:11,582
how are you?

972
01:55:11,617 --> 01:55:16,299
now you can write whatever you want

973
01:55:18,350 --> 01:55:20,292
isn't it the country you've been dreamed of?

974
01:55:21,646 --> 01:55:24,491
but Dreyman, is this federal Germany really what you artists wanted?

975
01:55:24,526 --> 01:55:26,701
is there anything left to write?

976
01:55:27,874 --> 01:55:31,379
people don't have faith any more, nor love

977
01:55:35,322 --> 01:55:37,182
this is a federal republic with real freedom.

978
01:55:38,302 --> 01:55:41,962
- does it make any sense?
- I have always wanted to ask you a question

979
01:55:42,234 --> 01:55:44,533
as you wish, Dreyman has the right to know everything

980
01:55:45,509 --> 01:55:47,631
why wasn't I banned?

981
01:55:48,853 --> 01:55:51,274
Why wasn't I watched?

982
01:55:57,483 --> 01:55:59,491
of course you were watched,
completely watched

983
01:56:00,447 --> 01:56:02,227
you were under full surveillance

984
01:56:03,495 --> 01:56:04,731
was I wiretapped also?

985
01:56:05,967 --> 01:56:09,601
absolutely, every drop of your life

986
01:56:10,534 --> 01:56:11,715
impossible

987
01:56:14,031 --> 01:56:16,864
use your imagination,
even your sexual life

988
01:56:17,332 --> 01:56:18,944
everything

989
01:56:20,786 --> 01:56:25,756
it was far beyond what you could
imagine, you little artist.

990
01:56:31,830 --> 01:56:34,139
fortunately, DDR doesn't exist anymore

991
01:58:08,123 --> 01:58:12,276
please wait a few minutes
there are a lot of files, we need some time to organize

992
01:58:54,827 --> 01:58:59,797
these are in the order of time
from the top

993
01:59:01,948 --> 01:59:03,595
take your time, they are all here

994
01:59:24,822 --> 01:59:29,187
surveillance report on Georg Dreyman

995
01:59:29,946 --> 01:59:33,032
if you have any questions or further interest, please contact the Information Section at National Security Agency.

996
01:59:36,465 --> 01:59:41,920
"Lazlo" received Frankfort Public Daily from Western Germany

997
01:59:42,366 --> 01:59:47,817
suggested Hauser and Wallner to stay low
in case to be watched by National Security

998
01:59:49,940 --> 01:59:54,766
Lazlo and CMS unpacked the presents
we speculated they had sex afterwards.

999
02:00:04,432 --> 02:00:08,467
Paul Hauser's uncle came to visit them from Western Berlin

1000
02:00:08,502 --> 02:00:10,672
They discussed together.
"Lazlo" and Hauser

1001
02:00:12,380 --> 02:00:14,610
were going to write a script for the 40th anniversary of DDR

1002
02:00:18,564 --> 02:00:21,402
they had been discussing the script

1003
02:00:21,437 --> 02:00:23,389
and the implication that
each character should convey

1004
02:00:25,961 --> 02:00:27,921
they thought that the most important element was the storyline

1005
02:00:28,533 --> 02:00:30,666
but the characters' personality could attract more audience

1006
02:00:31,299 --> 02:00:35,064
therefore became the key to the play's success.

1007
02:00:37,739 --> 02:00:40,164
no other reactionary opinions

1008
02:00:48,796 --> 02:00:51,054
HGW XX/7?

1009
02:01:04,901 --> 02:01:06,217
I, Christa-Maria Sieland

1010
02:01:06,616 --> 02:01:11,324
voluntarily cooperate with the National Security Agency

1011
02:01:11,359 --> 02:01:14,281
I promise to tell the truth,
nothing but the truth

1012
02:01:14,316 --> 02:01:16,657
all I said was for the safety of our country.

1013
02:01:21,703 --> 02:01:25,742
Georg Dreyman is a famous right-wing dramatist

1014
02:01:26,529 --> 02:01:29,152
he is very close to director Paul Hauser

1015
02:01:37,857 --> 02:01:42,149
Christa-Maria, March 10th, 1985

1016
02:01:42,744 --> 02:01:44,630
was arrested for overdose

1017
02:01:44,665 --> 02:01:48,143
and released on March 11th, around 3pm

1018
02:01:49,172 --> 02:01:52,991
while agents were searching Dreyman's place

1019
02:01:53,026 --> 02:01:55,703
she ran out of the apartment, died in a car accident

1020
02:01:59,920 --> 02:02:02,297
what's this all about?

1021
02:02:03,903 --> 02:02:07,626
who hid it?

1022
02:02:07,661 --> 02:02:11,533
for lack of evidence

1023
02:02:11,568 --> 02:02:14,037
The National Security had to close this case and call off all the surveillance on Dreyman

1024
02:02:18,515 --> 02:02:22,528
the entire mission was carried out by agent HGW XX/7

1025
02:02:23,358 --> 02:02:25,287
this mission was carried out on behalf
of the National Security and had
nothing to do with the agent himself

1026
02:02:25,322 --> 02:02:29,193
but I suggest the agent should not participate in the similar tasks

1027
02:02:31,857 --> 02:02:36,367
10:55, the surveillance devices were removed from Dreyman's

1028
02:02:39,025 --> 02:02:42,859
15:10, Christa was released from detention

1029
02:02:43,942 --> 02:02:46,643
then agents from the National Security searched Dreyman's place

1030
02:02:47,905 --> 02:02:51,669
15:15, the wiretapping was ended.

1031
02:03:09,488 --> 02:03:11,249
who is XX/7?

1032
02:03:54,460 --> 02:03:55,964
stop!

1033
02:04:44,717 --> 02:04:46,999
go back to Fayer street

1034
02:05:10,717 --> 02:05:12,999
2 Years Later

1035
02:05:13,717 --> 02:05:16,999
"Georg Dreyman:
The Sonata from Good Men"

1036
02:05:51,647 --> 02:06:01,845
"Georg Dreyman:
The Sonata from Good Men"

1037
02:06:04,647 --> 02:06:07,845
"Acknowledgement for Mr. HGW XX/7"

1038
02:05:41,647 --> 02:05:42,845
Hi

1039
02:06:27,425 --> 02:06:29,477
29.8 euros

1040
02:06:29,512 --> 02:06:30,783
Is it a present?

1041
02:06:31,848 --> 02:06:33,766
no, it is for myself

1042
02:06:33,767 --> 02:06:39,267
