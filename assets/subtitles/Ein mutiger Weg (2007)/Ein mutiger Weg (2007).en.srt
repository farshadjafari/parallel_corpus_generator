1
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:25,880
The day after 9/11,
Danny and I flew to Pakistan.

2
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:30,490
He was the South Asia Bureau Chief
for the Wall Street Journal

3
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:33,395
and I was working
for French Public Radio.

4
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:37,767
Thousands of journalists from
all over the world arrived in Islamabad

5
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,772
to cover the war
in neighboring Afghanistan.

6
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,136
On the 7th October the bombing began.

7
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:05,127
The forces of the Taliban Government
were rapidly overwhelmed.

8
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:12,897
And with the end of the war,
many journalists moved on.

9
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,966
Danny and I stayed.

10
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:19,535
Reporting on nuclear weapons,
Al Qaeda, secret Jihadi training camps

11
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:22,615
and the million refugees
still living in Peshawar,

12
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:24,910
the birthplace of the Taliban.

13
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:31,981
As the hunt for Bin Laden
continued in the mountains of Tora Bora

14
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:35,687
many fighters slipped back
across the border into Pakistan,

15
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:38,457
Looking for a safe place to regroup.

16
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,762
And many people in Pakistan
saw America as the enemy

17
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,895
and the Taliban
as their Muslim brothers.

18
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:54,908
By the end of January,
I was five months pregnant

19
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:57,380
and we were ready to go home.

20
00:01:57,484 --> 00:02:00,715
But there was one more interview
that Danny wanted.

21
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:07,421
We flew to Karachi,
one of the largest cities in the world.

22
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:11,190
The main port of entry to
and departure from Pakistan.

23
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:18,133
A vast, sprawling, chaotic city
where there are so many people

24
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:20,536
nobody knows how to count them.

25
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:24,571
How do you find
one man amongst all this?

26
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:10,547
Okay, thank you.

27
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,025
- Hey.
- Hi. How's it going?

28
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:21,794
Yeah, it's okay.

29
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,527
- Where's Mariane?
- She's in bed, I think.

30
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:27,572
Do you know where the
headquarters of Cybernet is?

31
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,608
Cybernet? Yeah. Why?

32
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:30,971
- You know Richard Reid?
- Yeah.

33
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:34,410
He sent an e-mail to his handler here,
it's a Cybernet address.

34
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:37,176
- You wanna go there?
- Yeah.

35
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,715
Hey. How are you feeling?

36
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:48,124
Huge. Pregnant. I stink.

37
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:52,130
I'll show you stink. Make a lot of stink.

38
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:56,290
This time tomorrow we're gonna be
in an air-conditioned hotel in Dubai.

39
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,802
- How's my little embryo?
- Good.

40
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,930
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

41
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,166
Yeah.

42
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:06,978
Secrets?

43
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,674
- I have a name for him.
- You do?

44
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:16,988
- What?
- Adam.

45
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,387
Adam?

46
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:26,962
- Sheraton haven't got any cars today.
- Really?

47
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,802
- Okay, khuda hafeez.
- I need one as well.

48
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:35,340
It's not a problem.
I'll get Shabir to get you guys a taxi.

49
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,842
As long as it doesn't take too long.
I can't be late.

50
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:46,148
- Thank you.
- No problem.

51
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:49,415
All right, I gotta roll. I love you.

52
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:52,787
- I'll call you. Leave your phone on.
- Okay.

53
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:59,622
I'll see you at the supermarket, okay?

54
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,029
Take care of her.

55
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:05,200
- Do you have a boy?
- I have a daughter, one, sir.

56
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,672
- How old?
- Maybe eight and a half months.

57
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:12,836
Daughter good. No problem. Life.

58
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:15,709
- Boy too much problem, life.
- Yeah.

59
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:19,843
Danny. Kaleem Yusuf.

60
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:21,510
- Danny Pearl.
- Nice to meet you.

61
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:24,454
Please, come through.
Would you care for some tea?

62
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:27,488
I want to ask your advice
about something.

63
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:31,620
I'm supposed to meet tonight
with Sheikh Gilani.

64
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:34,791
- Where are you supposed to meet him?
- At the Village Restaurant.

65
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:40,464
Provided you meet him at a public place
you should be all right.

66
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:43,201
- Just be careful.
- Okay, I will.

67
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:44,640
Good.

68
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,561
It's not just religious fundamentalism
that we are fighting.

69
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:07,122
It's a combination of tribalism,
retrogressive cultural values

70
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:10,327
and a totally decayed
criminal justice system.

71
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:13,564
So what is your focus, your solution?

72
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:17,799
- Tonight you go?
- Tomorrow, yeah.

73
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,207
Why, my friend?

74
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:22,076
- You know Dubai?
- I know, sir, Dubai.

75
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:25,082
- Have you been there?
- No, no. Only Karachi.

76
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:33,988
So I'm trying to find someone
who's using Cybernet as his ISP.

77
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:37,153
I have the e-mail account name

78
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:40,460
and I was wondering if you'd
be able to give me the IP number

79
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,534
or the name of the account holder?

80
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:46,435
It is possible but I guess everything
here is very confidential

81
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:50,703
and we are not supposed to leak
any sort of information to anybody.

82
00:06:56,616 --> 00:07:00,643
Asra? Yeah, I'll be there in 10 minutes.

83
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:05,883
Masud.

84
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:07,857
Danny. How are you?
Is everything okay?

85
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,485
Yeah. No, I'm all right,
I'm on my way now.

86
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,291
Okay. Is Mariane going with you?

87
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:15,629
- No, she's not. She's gonna stay home.
- No? That's good.

88
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:18,670
- Why? Is there a problem?
- No, no, there's no problem.

89
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,262
As long as you meet in public,
there shouldn't be a problem.

90
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:24,207
All right.
I mean, it's what everybody tells me.

91
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:27,040
Yeah, because that's true.
Good luck for the meeting.

92
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:28,738
Yeah, thanks.

93
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,391
Hey. Hey, baby.

94
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:47,694
- Hey, where are you?
- I'm at the supermarket.

95
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,927
- What are you cooking?
- Picadillo.

96
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:52,596
Oh, yeah? Excellent.

97
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:54,002
How are you?
How was your day?

98
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:56,506
It was all right.
They didn't tell me much.

99
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:02,638
- What time will you be back?
- I'm hoping 9:00.

100
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:05,546
I'm sitting in a parking lot right now
but hopefully we'll get moving

101
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,744
and I'm still hoping 9:00.

102
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:11,179
- Listen, I love you.
- Love you.

103
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,315
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

104
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,510
Pakistani and Indian troops

105
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:35,843
are still massing
on the disputed Kashmir border...

106
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:37,813
Asra, how much time do I have?

107
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:40,977
It's okay. We've got lots of time.
Don't worry.

108
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:05,637
Glasses, glasses.

109
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:26,622
The number you have dialed is not
responding at the moment.

110
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,359
Please try later.

111
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:39,369
Excuse me.
How far are we going?

112
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,983
- How's it going?
- Good.

113
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,073
So, it's just helping.

114
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:11,666
- What is it that you're doing?
- It's a cabin crew job. Qatar Airways.

115
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:15,304
- That is the toughest job in the world.
- It is. Waking up at 4:00 in the morning.

116
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:17,814
- How much are they paying you?
- I love the way she says Urdu.

117
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:21,148
At least I can say "water"
as opposed to "water. "

118
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:25,517
No-one says "water" here. Okay?
We all say "water. "

119
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:30,128
- Hey, this food is really good.
- Yes, it's very nice.

120
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:31,423
It's a Cuban dish.

121
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,588
- Cuban?
- Cuban.

122
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:36,896
- Is that where you're from?
- No. My mother's Cuban. I'm from Paris.

123
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:40,495
- Where's that CIA agent, man?
- How do you mean?

124
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:43,905
All the American journalists
are CIA agents, aren't they?

125
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,204
Sure.

126
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,939
I work for the Wall Street Journal,
so does that make me a CIA agent?

127
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:51,141
But what do the Americans
really know about Pakistan?

128
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:52,750
What do they know about Afghanistan?

129
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,683
Apart from bombing it all the time.

130
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,652
That's why I'm a journalist,
to let people know.

131
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:59,384
- That's a romantic idea of journalism.
- I don't think so.

132
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,052
Read the papers here,
you'll be definitely more cynical.

133
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,823
- Sweet Indian maiden.
- Yeah, whatever.

134
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,265
That sounds so wrong.

135
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:10,301
Please try later.

136
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:15,097
But that's how you guys
say it, right? "Hot. "

137
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,407
- Thanks for dropping in, dude.
- See you soon, inshallah.

138
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,779
Say salaam to your dad, right?

139
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:31,045
I still can't get through to Danny.

140
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:33,387
Well, maybe they took him
to a madrasa out of town.

141
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:37,519
No, he would call me.
I'm going to check his computer.

142
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,188
Okay.

143
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:41,960
Maybe his battery is low or something.

144
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:51,340
"Dear Mr. Pearl,
thank you very much for your articles.

145
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,503
"I have passed the printout
to Shah saab.

146
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:56,274
"He has gone to Karachi for a few days.

147
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,517
"I will arrange an appointment
with the Sheikh in Karachi for you

148
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:00,607
"on Tuesday or Wednesday.

149
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,553
"Please give the Sheikh
my regards. Bashir.

150
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:08,324
"Sheikh saab is expecting you
at 7:00 p. m. on Wednesday

151
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:11,294
"and hopefully
you will get at least half hour with him.

152
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,194
"Looking forward
to hearing from you. Bashir. "

153
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:14,288
How's it going?

154
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,699
I found the e-mails
setting up Danny's meeting with Gilani.

155
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:24,106
His contact is Imtiaz Siddique, 01300...

156
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,906
- Yeah. Yeah.
- ... 344

157
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:29,139
6543.

158
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,982
There's another number, hold on.
His brother's mobile.

159
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,146
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

160
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,281
Okay. Where was it?

161
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:42,952
No, this line is disconnected as well.
It's not working.

162
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:48,856
That e-mail address, "Nobadmashi. "

163
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:52,563
In Urdu it means, like, "no wrongdoing. "

164
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:55,401
It's a weird e-mail address.

165
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:58,500
The brother's number is bullshit
and Siddique's number is bullshit.

166
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,101
It's bullshit.

167
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:21,893
"Jamaat Ul-Fuqra. "

168
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:24,765
- Fugra?
- Fugra, Fuqra, who cares?

169
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,599
Community of the Impoverished.

170
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:29,367
Their aim
is to purify Islam through violence.

171
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,703
"Ten unsolved assassinations.

172
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,177
"Seventeen firebombing cases
between 1979 and 1990.

173
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,475
"Possible link to Richard Reid,
the shoe bomber.

174
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,614
"They are suspected
to have connection to terrorists

175
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:43,347
"who bombed World Trade Center
in '93."

176
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,990
I didn't know Gilani was that serious.

177
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:53,622
No, Sheikh Gilani is a peaceful man.
He's always upset when people die.

178
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:56,462
So he was upset that
the World Trade Centers were bombed?

179
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:59,037
Yes, because many of his followers
are American.

180
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:01,629
Do you know who's behind the attack
on the World Trade Center?

181
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,823
- Who?
- The Jews.

182
00:14:02,858 --> 00:14:03,907
- Who?
- The Jews.

183
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:04,998
Really?

184
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:09,604
Mossad are the only ones who
could have organized such an event.

185
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:12,650
Do you know that 4,000 Jews
who normally worked in the Towers

186
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:14,013
didn't turn up that day?

187
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,349
What are you? A Christian?

188
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,890
No, Jewish.

189
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,728
The American Consulate,
Corporal Bailey speaking.

190
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:34,806
How can I help you?

191
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:36,636
Hello, my name is Mariane Pearl

192
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:39,506
and I'm calling
because my husband is missing.

193
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,012
He's a journalist. And he was...

194
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:46,117
Ma'am, I'm afraid the Consulate
is closed at the moment.

195
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,879
If you can call back in the morning

196
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:51,684
and ask for Randall Bennett,
he's Diplomatic Security.

197
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,020
He gets in pretty early, okay?

198
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,961
Hi, can I speak to John Bussey, please?

199
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,458
- John Bussey.
- Hi, John, this is Asra.

200
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:05,765
Hey, Asra. How are you?
How's the book?

201
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:07,065
Yeah, it's going really well.

202
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,800
John, listen,
I'm with Mariane Pearl in Karachi

203
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:14,744
and Danny went for an interview earlier
on today and he hasn't come back yet.

204
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,906
Oh, okay.

205
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:20,581
Well, who's he interviewing?

206
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:25,251
Hello?

207
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:27,990
- Ruth, it's Mariane.
- Mariane?

208
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:31,092
Judea? It's Mariane.

209
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:33,426
Is everything all right?

210
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:35,363
Danny had an interview
and he's not back.

211
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:36,934
He didn't come home last night.

212
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,800
Mariane, this is Judea.
Who was he interviewing?

213
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:42,965
A religious leader.
His name was Sheikh Gilani.

214
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,771
Does anyone there
know that he's Jewish?

215
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:49,009
No, I don't think so.

216
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:54,316
Mariane, just let us know
as soon as you hear anything. Okay?

217
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,888
Okay. Bye, Ruth.

218
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,289
Sorry, I'm so late.

219
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:05,829
I love you. I'll call you, okay?

220
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:43,697
- Hello, I'm calling for Randall Bennett.
- Randall Bennett speaking.

221
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:47,704
Hello, my name is Mariane Pearl
and my husband is Daniel Pearl.

222
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:49,740
He's a journalist
for the Wall Street Journal.

223
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,104
I know your husband.

224
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:54,373
- You do?
- Yeah, I met him yesterday.

225
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,175
- Daniel?
- Daniel Pearl, yeah.

226
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,977
Randall Bennett, Diplomatic
Security Service. How are you?

227
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:01,143
I wanna ask your advice
about something, if you don't mind.

228
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:04,518
I'm supposed to be meeting later
with Sheikh Gilani.

229
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:05,590
Okay.

230
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,885
And I wanna get a sense from you

231
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:09,051
whether you think
that that's a good idea.

232
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:12,528
- Who arranged that meeting for you?
- My fixer in Islamabad.

233
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:14,789
- Is he going to be there?
- No.

234
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,198
I mean, I left him in Islamabad.

235
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,702
- Hello?
- Masud, it's Mariane.

236
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:29,008
- Hi, Mariane. Is everything okay?
- Danny did not come home last night.

237
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:31,082
What do you mean
he didn't come home last night?

238
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:34,016
I need a number for Bashir.

239
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:37,953
I have the number to the contact
but I don't have the number to Bashir.

240
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,718
Who is your contact?

241
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,019
His name is Arif.

242
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:43,219
He met him in Rawalpindi.

243
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:51,100
Driver, please stop near
the Hotel Akbar International.

244
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,546
- Hello.
- Hi. I'm Danny.

245
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:11,680
- Hello.
- Masud.

246
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,350
- What's your name?
- Bashir.

247
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,825
Hello, Bashir, nice to meet you.

248
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:21,830
You know, Sheikh Gilani
is a direct descendant of the Prophet.

249
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,526
He is a Pir.

250
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:28,137
- A holy man.
- The holy man.

251
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,174
Most of the journalists who come here,

252
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,436
they come
with only one story they want to write

253
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:34,978
and that is,
they want to write about terrorism.

254
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,877
Is that what you want?

255
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:40,110
Honestly, I can't tell you that
until I meet him.

256
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:41,652
I don't know that until I meet him.

257
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:44,517
Sheikh Gilani
does not want to meet journalists.

258
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:49,356
I understand.
Listen, I have a number of articles.

259
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:52,453
If you'd like to see them,
I'd be happy to show them to you.

260
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:55,658
Is there a way
for me to get in touch with you?

261
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,758
My e-mail address is on there.

262
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,895
Bashir is a Jihadi?

263
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:03,304
- It's possible, I'm not sure.
- Is he connected to Al Qaeda?

264
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:05,308
I'm not sure. I'm not sure at all.

265
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,310
I'll call Arif
and I'll call you straight back.

266
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:10,540
- This is serious, actually.
- Yeah, you call me straight back.

267
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:19,748
Give me Danny's computer.

268
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:27,193
Look through all the papers in here
and put them over there.

269
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:28,596
Is this your house?

270
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,600
- Yes, it's my house.
- Your name?

271
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:31,828
Asra Nomani.

272
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,734
Have you got any ID?

273
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,034
Yes, I have my passport.

274
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:38,965
I'm from India.

275
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:40,271
India?

276
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:45,950
There are some codes.

277
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:48,611
That's his shorthand.
He's a journalist.

278
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,847
Do you have
a photograph of your husband?

279
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:53,754
There's a bag with a circle, a polka dot.

280
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,288
Look under the bed.

281
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,460
- Is this your husband?
- Yes.

282
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,338
Give those pictures to me.

283
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,900
- Yeah?
- Hi, Mariane, this is Masud.

284
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:16,276
I was calling Arif
but his mobile is switched off.

285
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,178
Get down here. Okay?

286
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:22,445
I'm a bit afraid of police,
can you please protect me from them?

287
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:26,217
- Get down here. Okay?
- Okay, fine.

288
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:28,156
Is he coming?

289
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,438
- Hello.
- Yes, I'm Mariane. Who are you?

290
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:43,804
Javed Habib. I am SSP CID.

291
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,275
- He's Dost, MI.
- Hello.

292
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:47,402
Hello.

293
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:51,141
- What is that?
- Military Intelligence. I am Chief of CID.

294
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,617
- The unit in charge of counter-terrorism.
- Counter-terrorism?

295
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,381
Randall Bennett has called me.

296
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:58,080
Randall Bennett?

297
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:03,158
Can you help me to understand
what is this?

298
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:06,855
The most important thing for us
is to find your husband.

299
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:16,699
Look, Asra and I are your best ally.

300
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:21,939
Right? We are both journalists
and we should work together.

301
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:26,579
I would not like
to have it any other way, Mrs. Pearl.

302
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:29,483
I need your support. I need your help.

303
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:33,046
- We have Danny's computer.
- Okay. Could I see it?

304
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:34,887
I'll go and get it.

305
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:36,688
Who took him to the restaurant?

306
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:39,055
Did you get the taxi for Daniel Pearl?

307
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:41,496
- Yes, sir.
- Where did you get the taxi from?

308
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:44,429
Sir, from Two Swords.

309
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,631
Get out.

310
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:50,974
What's your name?

311
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:55,170
Hello, son.

312
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,474
What's your name?

313
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:59,106
- Harris, sir.
- Harris?

314
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:04,013
- What's that?
- Can you translate that?

315
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,092
We'll find your Danny.

316
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,629
You must take care of yourself
and the baby.

317
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:17,996
- You didn't see anyone at 7pm?
- No.

318
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:20,128
There was no foreigner here yesterday?

319
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:27,810
Yesterday evening,
did you see a foreigner here?

320
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:29,436
No, sir.

321
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:36,478
The Al Qaeda suspects, seen on
their arrival in Cuba earlier this month,

322
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:38,488
are the subject of renewed concern

323
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:42,219
over how the United States
is treating its detainees.

324
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:11,083
The number you have dialed
is not responding at the moment.

325
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:18,261
I'm really sorry about Danny.

326
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:20,627
- Have you heard any news?
- No.

327
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:23,064
Can you tell us what you know?

328
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:25,068
Danny wanted to meet Gilani.

329
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:29,231
He went with Arif.
And we spoke with Bashir...

330
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:32,037
- And who's Arif?
- I don't know.

331
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,943
What do you mean you don't know?
How did you meet him?

332
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:39,312
- I got his number from a friend of mine.
- Okay, so who's the friend?

333
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,978
- I can't tell you.
- You can't tell us? Why is that?

334
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,486
Is that because
they paid you for Danny?

335
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,351
How much did they pay you for Danny?

336
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:48,017
I was doing my job, helping Danny.

337
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:50,788
I don't think you understand
how serious this is.

338
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:54,832
We need that name to find Danny.
Danny is missing.

339
00:23:56,168 --> 00:24:00,127
He may be able to help me find him.
Okay? I need the name.

340
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:02,935
I promised him not to give his name.

341
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:05,032
Do you understand that maybe

342
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:09,546
you can make the difference
of helping Danny or nobody finds him?

343
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:14,075
Maybe nobody finds him because
you won't give the fucking name!

344
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,548
Yeah, hello?

345
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,628
Hello, Paracha, this is Masud.

346
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:26,924
I'm with Mariane Pearl.
They want to talk to you.

347
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:29,125
You gave them my name?

348
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:33,033
Hello? Can you tell me anything
that you know about Arif?

349
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:37,302
I met Arif at Harkut-ul-Mujahideen.
He's just a Jihadi.

350
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:38,876
But what's his full name?

351
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,969
I don't know. I don't know
anything about him personally.

352
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,913
A few weeks ago
they were having this organization legal

353
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:46,711
but now they've all gone underground.

354
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,251
Okay, look,
I don't need a political speech.

355
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:50,947
Can you just give me some information?

356
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:03,267
He had short hair, skinny
and was wearing glasses.

357
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:06,201
We found one person.

358
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:11,465
I told Danny
not to contact Bashir directly.

359
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:14,306
- Can you describe Bashir for us?
- I can try.

360
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:18,577
- What is your name?
- Aqeel Nawaz.

361
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:38,560
We've brought you something.
It was the best we could find in Karachi.

362
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,935
I'm Randall Bennett.

363
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,973
- It's nice to meet you at last.
- Nice to meet you.

364
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:52,015
- This is Philippe Scaerou.
- Hello.

365
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:55,518
And Veronique Laurent
from the French Embassy.

366
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:59,480
And from the FBI
we have Maureen Platt...

367
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:01,616
Mrs. Pearl, we're gonna need
to look at Daniel's computer.

368
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:04,661
These gentlemen
need to copy the hard drive.

369
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,453
Hello.

370
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,500
If you need anything, don't hesitate.

371
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:11,931
Goodbye, Mariane, be brave.

372
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:16,073
- How are you?
- Captain.

373
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:18,039
I haven't been introduced
to this gentleman here.

374
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:19,610
Javed Habib, Chief of CID.

375
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:22,236
He's leading the investigation
on the Pakistani side.

376
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:23,541
Interesting. Thank you.

377
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:25,946
- Agent Platt.
- Excuse me.

378
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:29,010
We have been discussing

379
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,248
how important it is
that everybody shares information.

380
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:33,619
- Of course.
- Bennett.

381
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:35,192
- Yes?
- It's kind of a private call.

382
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:37,989
Do you think
you can you clear the room?

383
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,791
All right. Come on, gentlemen. Today.
Let's go. Let's move it out.

384
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:45,761
Thank you, gentlemen.

385
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,963
This is for you.

386
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:51,500
It's as much
as I could get together in 24 hours.

387
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,634
There's a lot about Gilani

388
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:55,406
and some other people
that are beginning to appear.

389
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:57,981
Why have we not heard
from the kidnappers?

390
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:02,247
Well, they're gonna wanna get Danny to
a safe place before they make contact.

391
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:04,379
And we've got
the police doing everything they can

392
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:06,116
to make it difficult.

393
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:10,092
I want you to know that they consider
Danny a high-value hostage

394
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,789
and they'll wanna keep him alive.

395
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,823
Gilani.

396
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:23,731
Akbar.

397
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:26,575
Reid going to Boston.

398
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,807
And then we tally the number.

399
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,358
So now we have one piece of news.

400
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:47,056
- Finally we have found the taxi driver.
- What did he say?

401
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,793
He took Danny
to the Village Restaurant for 7:00.

402
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:54,201
Danny received a phone call
and then he told taxi driver he could go.

403
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:57,138
I'm gonna let you go, okay? Thank you.

404
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:04,339
Yeah, but do we believe that story?

405
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:06,679
Waiters at the restaurant
corroborate his story.

406
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:08,013
Okay. Right.

407
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:10,553
And no luck so far with Gilani.

408
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:12,816
- Or Bashir or Siddique?
- No.

409
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:15,051
And what about Masud?
What's happening with him?

410
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,149
He's here.

411
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:18,354
We are sending him back
to Islamabad tonight.

412
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:20,124
He has to look for Arif.

413
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:23,894
He's here with his brother-in-law,
who's a journalist.

414
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:25,230
He's a journalist? He's here?

415
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:28,100
He works for Takbeer.
A Jihadi newspaper. Very anti-US.

416
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,538
- What? Where is he?
- He's outside.

417
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,078
What is this? Who are these people?

418
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:37,546
Why are you bringing them
to my house?

419
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:40,277
- Why is there a journalist in my home?
- This guy is torturing me.

420
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,444
He's a torturer.
He's going to go with me to Islamabad.

421
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,522
- What is this?
- Help me.

422
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:45,782
It's not true. It's not true at all.

423
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,450
You need to find Arif
and you need to find Bashir.

424
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,721
And don't bring people to my house
that don't like Americans.

425
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:51,796
Danny's American.

426
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:54,160
- And don't write shit.
- Sorry for that.

427
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:56,460
Come on, get them in the car.

428
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,660
Go on, move it.

429
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:59,669
Make sure nothing goes wrong.

430
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:01,568
We're conducting
a proper investigation.

431
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:07,502
How long have you been here?

432
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:08,977
One year, sir.

433
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:11,148
How many children do you have?

434
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,238
Sir, only one child.

435
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,147
- Only one?
- Yes.

436
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:26,187
No, but just tell me.
That's what I'm saying.

437
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:31,362
The ISI came to my parents and asked,
where did this girl come from?

438
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:32,834
From India?

439
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:35,336
I understand but you know
I'm not involved in any of that.

440
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,873
I know that but...

441
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:44,343
He won't come back.
His family will never let him come back.

442
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,616
Some Intelligence guys
went over to his house,

443
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:50,313
said I was some kind of an Indian spy

444
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:55,183
and that they'd make a big scandal
for his family.

445
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,352
He's afraid of his family?

446
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:28,848
Connect those lines.

447
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:50,411
Mariane. Hi.

448
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:53,277
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

449
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:55,750
- Any news? No.
- No.

450
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,685
How was the honeymoon?

451
00:30:57,789 --> 00:30:59,814
It was good, yeah. It was good.

452
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:04,793
I brought loads of stuff,
a computer, printer, phones.

453
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:08,324
How many lines are you getting us?

454
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:09,457
Six lines.

455
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:10,727
Where are they coming from?

456
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:12,234
We're cutting off
the neighbors' phone lines.

457
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:13,326
What will happen to their phones?

458
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:15,338
They'll have to use yours.

459
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:17,834
Hasan, this is Steve.

460
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:19,136
Hello.

461
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:21,335
You speak Urdu?

462
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:23,243
Steve and Danny
worked together in Islamabad.

463
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:25,942
Okay. You knew Mr. Pearl?

464
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:30,419
So, they still need to find Arif,
the go-between,

465
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:32,489
Bashir in Rawalpindi,

466
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:37,789
Imtiaz Siddique here in Karachi
and Gilani, wherever he is.

467
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,261
And Danny.

468
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:42,026
And Danny.

469
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:48,064
Check everybody's ID
before you let them through.

470
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:59,949
My mother is here and she wants me to
marry someone who I really don't know.

471
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:03,987
- What, like an arranged marriage?
- It is, 100%.

472
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,781
Have you seen this article
from The Independent?

473
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,126
What's that?

474
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:11,195
The Journal's bureau in London
sent it through.

475
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:14,857
It's about a British Pakistani,
Omar Saeed Sheikh.

476
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:18,868
It claims that he wired $100,000
to Mohammed Atta just before 9/11.

477
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,870
How does that connect to Danny?

478
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:22,371
Well, he's based in Rawalpindi

479
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:25,806
and he specializes
in kidnapping Westerners.

480
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,775
- Can I see it?
- Yeah.

481
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,377
- Do you know him?
- I know him only by reputation.

482
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:36,343
- Hello.
- It's John Bussey.

483
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,786
Let me talk to Mariane, please.

484
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:41,692
Hello?

485
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:45,957
- Hey, Mariane. It's John. How are you?
- Hello.

486
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:47,292
I need you to come here.

487
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:51,630
I'm thinking maybe the best thing
for me to do is to go to Islamabad first.

488
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:53,260
No, no, to Karachi.

489
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:55,066
To make the diplomatic rounds with us.

490
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:56,970
Okay. No, that makes sense to me.

491
00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:59,441
- Soon, yeah?
- Yeah, very soon. Very, very soon.

492
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:01,068
- All right.
- We pretty much can write him off.

493
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:06,582
Captain, can I talk to you?

494
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:15,626
Danny is not a religious man.
But...

495
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,989
But he's Jewish, by birth.

496
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:22,394
Okay.

497
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,435
Who else knows this?

498
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:28,896
He didn't advertise it

499
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:32,443
but he would never deny
if somebody asked him.

500
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:35,473
Okay.

501
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,480
But don't tell anybody.

502
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:42,085
I won't.

503
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:58,895
- Look at this.
- What does it say?

504
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:02,029
It says Danny is suspected
of being a Mossad agent

505
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:05,234
and of having relations
with India's Intelligence Agency.

506
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:06,970
Give it to me.

507
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:12,381
- Who was it I gave that picture to?
- Military Intelligence.

508
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:14,883
They think he's Mossad,
they're going to kill him.

509
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:16,954
What is everybody doing?

510
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:20,022
What the fuck is everybody doing?

511
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:53,914
Very silly.

512
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:03,693
Is this the address?

513
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:04,992
Hello?

514
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:08,396
Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

515
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:11,398
Okay, yeah, I've got it.
I've got it. Thanks.

516
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:14,637
- What?
- There's an e-mail from the kidnappers.

517
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:21,342
"The National Movement for the
Restoration of Pakistan Sovereignty

518
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:24,683
"has captured CIA officer Daniel Pearl

519
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:28,054
"who has been posing as a journalist
of the Wall Street Journal.

520
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:32,391
"Unfortunately he is at present being
kept in very inhuman circumstances

521
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:33,930
"quite similar, in fact, to the way

522
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:36,090
"that Pakistanis and nationals
of other sovereign countries

523
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,725
"have been kept in Cuba
by the American Army.

524
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:41,236
"If the Americans keep our countrymen
in better conditions

525
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:43,273
"we will better
the conditions of Mr. Pearl

526
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:46,207
"and all other Americans
that we capture. "

527
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:50,606
Jang claims he's Mossad
and now they're claiming he's CIA.

528
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:55,010
These things they do to shock you.

529
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:59,150
They're asking
for the release of jet plane.

530
00:36:06,397 --> 00:36:08,228
- Hello. Captain.
- Randall.

531
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,994
I need the original e-mail
so we can see the header.

532
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:12,194
Well, this is a copy.

533
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:14,100
The original
was sent to the Washington Post.

534
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:17,504
- I need the original.
- Here are the photographs.

535
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:19,303
- This is all of them right here?
- Okay.

536
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:22,004
This is the only document that came?

537
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,314
- When did you get this?
- Half an hour ago.

538
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:35,450
Can we get someone to figure out
what kind of camera this was?

539
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,720
Yeah, but it wasn't sent to the Journal.

540
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:39,387
- Are these Danny's clothes?
- No.

541
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,933
- Can you print this out for me please?
- This photo doesn't look real.

542
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,697
I think that's a doctored photo.
I don't think this is Danny.

543
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:47,793
Look at this,

544
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:51,068
you compare the dimensions here
with the dimensions here.

545
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:52,836
That's Danny.

546
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:58,811
- Let's send it off to the lab anyway.
- Do what you wish.

547
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:00,383
Dost, can you get on this right away?

548
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:03,351
We're gonna
have to get this to Washington.

549
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:08,051
- Hello?
- Mariane.

550
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:11,856
It's his mother.
It's Danny's mother. Hello.

551
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:13,123
Have you seen them?

552
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,698
- The photos of Danny.
- Yes.

553
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:16,994
- It's good news, Mariane.
- Yes.

554
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:19,433
It means Danny is alive.

555
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:21,562
Yes, of course he's alive. Yes.

556
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:25,267
The people here,
they don't think it's real.

557
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,502
They don't think they're really Danny.

558
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:29,444
Of course they are.
I recognize his hands.

559
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,811
Listen, they're going to
release him, okay?

560
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,977
I mean, no one would ever
want to hurt Danny.

561
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,522
You see that?

562
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:49,224
He's smiling.

563
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:54,830
He has a gun to his head and he's
smiling and he's telling me he's okay.

564
00:37:58,743 --> 00:37:59,903
Yeah.

565
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:02,308
He says "fuck you" to them.

566
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:09,083
She'll be fine. She'll be fine.

567
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:19,195
I appreciate how difficult this meeting
is gonna be for you, Mrs. Pearl.

568
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:22,630
We need the Minister to authorize
a national force to look for Danny.

569
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:27,798
Just because he was taken in Karachi
doesn't mean he's still here.

570
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:36,673
Minister. Good to meet you.

571
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:38,373
- This is Mariane Pearl.
- How do you do?

572
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:39,915
Thank you for meeting with us.

573
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:42,815
Mrs. Pearl, let me tell you something.

574
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:47,547
There were 3,000 journalists in
Pakistan during the war in Afghanistan.

575
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:50,285
Not one of them got into trouble.

576
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:51,884
Danny and I
were two of those journalists,

577
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,396
so I'm sorry,
I don't understand your point.

578
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,295
Why did your husband
have to meet with these people?

579
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,095
He's a journalist.

580
00:38:58,202 --> 00:39:00,466
I don't think this is the business
of a journalist.

581
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:01,868
Forgive me for correcting you,

582
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:04,634
but it is absolutely
the business of a journalist.

583
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:06,642
- Mrs. Pearl.
- Yes?

584
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:08,336
We do have information

585
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:11,472
that the Indian Intelligence Services
are behind this kidnapping.

586
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:13,106
You really believe that?
I don't think...

587
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:16,118
They are trying to embarrass Pakistan

588
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:19,883
by blaming Islamic extremists or the ISI

589
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:23,687
for the disappearance of an
American journalist. Don't you see it?

590
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:26,160
I think we must conclude at this point.

591
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:30,461
Mr. Bauman, I am slightly busy
and I do have some prior engagements.

592
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:32,729
Thank you. Mr. Bauman.

593
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:35,696
- Mrs. Pearl.
- Thank you.

594
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:38,070
- Thanks.
- Thank you, Mr. Bauman.

595
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,942
Have you seen this person?

596
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:48,614
I'm looking for somebody who
stayed here called Chaudhry Bashir.

597
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:49,845
Here is his number.

598
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:01,197
How long do we have to stay here?

599
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:02,731
Until we find him.

600
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:11,704
I'm sorry I was unable to come
sooner. I've been away.

601
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:18,406
But I have here a list of all the calls
that Danny made from the 19th.

602
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:20,916
Didn't you meet with Danny
the day that he was kidnapped?

603
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:25,387
That's right. Danny told me
he was meeting with Gilani.

604
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:29,391
In fact, while he was with me,
he received two phone calls.

605
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:31,255
Right.

606
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,821
Right, I'll be there.

607
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:37,997
We work with telephone numbers.

608
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:41,765
We start with Danny's number
and Arifs,

609
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:43,806
Imtiaz Siddique's and Bashir's.

610
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:46,399
From these numbers
we find their contacts

611
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:49,638
and then we obtain the numbers
that they called and so on

612
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:54,013
until we find the kidnappers.
This is our business.

613
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:57,281
And let me assure you,
we know what we're doing.

614
00:40:57,388 --> 00:41:01,586
They're sourcing the IP
from Bashir's e-mail, right?

615
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:03,057
That's what they're trying to do.

616
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,628
- And no luck so far?
- No.

617
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:28,510
We're coming to you from
the Los Angeles home of Daniel Pearl,

618
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:31,349
the journalist who has been
kidnapped in Pakistan.

619
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:32,547
A group calling itself

620
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:35,750
the National Movement for the
Restoration of Pakistani Sovereignty

621
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:38,886
is claiming responsibility
for the kidnapping

622
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:43,729
and says it's hoping for better treatment
of US prisoners held in Cuba.

623
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:49,372
Excuse me, sorry.

624
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:51,964
Are you sure this is the right way?
This is the right way?

625
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:53,304
Yes, sir.

626
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:55,975
Do you have a map?

627
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,787
No. Sorry.

628
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:23,235
The scene outside the house
is out of control.

629
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:27,608
- We have to respond.
- I think you should handle most of it.

630
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:30,305
Great. We've gotten hundreds
and hundreds of requests.

631
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:33,713
You have an authority that
nobody else has to say who Danny is.

632
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:35,717
And they've already said
that he's Mossad.

633
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:37,252
They've already said he's CIA.

634
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:43,384
By not responding we're tacitly allowing
these things to go unchallenged.

635
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:45,724
We also have been talking
to Colin Powell.

636
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:48,992
Colin Powell has been talking
to President Musharraf.

637
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:51,226
- Asking him to do what?
- We also got a...

638
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:54,168
I'm sorry.
We've also issued a statement

639
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:56,569
saying that Danny
did not work for the Government,

640
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:58,198
that Danny did not work for the CIA.

641
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:03,042
The CIA has then agreed
to issue a statement confirming that.

642
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:05,513
- They're gonna confirm that publicly?
- Yeah.

643
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:06,674
- The CIA?
- Yeah.

644
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:11,483
We're doing everything we possibly
can do to make sure that Danny is safe.

645
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:14,651
Okay, we're on our way.

646
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,659
Masud, where's the coach station
for Muzaffarabad?

647
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:18,955
Is Arif going to Muzaffarabad?

648
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:20,860
From Pirwadhi Bus Station?

649
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:33,037
Is Arif here?

650
00:43:58,068 --> 00:44:02,971
Seventy-three numbers have now been
recognized as possible suspects.

651
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:06,338
Our analysis
is beginning to yield results.

652
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:10,345
One of the numbers that Bashir called
is a land line in Lahore.

653
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:13,712
And that land line
belongs to a Sony TV dealer.

654
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:20,117
And the Sony TV dealer was frequently
calling another man in Karachi.

655
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:30,158
And this person was frequently calling
another man in Punjab.

656
00:44:36,373 --> 00:44:38,398
Where is Hashim's house?

657
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:42,436
Where is Hashim's house?

658
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:49,210
Where is Hashim?

659
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:50,616
We want to search the house.

660
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:51,779
Why are you all coming in here?

661
00:44:51,922 --> 00:44:56,757
Now, the important thing is,
Hashim also goes by the name of Arif.

662
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,761
- Arif?
- That's great.

663
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:04,095
- We have a photograph of Arif.
- You found Arif? Great.

664
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:10,436
But his family
claims he died in Afghanistan.

665
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:12,440
What?

666
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,101
He told Danny he was going to Kashmir.

667
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:15,200
Exactly.

668
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:17,746
- Well, is there a body?
- No. There's no body.

669
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:20,510
We do not believe
he's necessarily dead.

670
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:23,814
His group
has a lot of fighters in Kashmir.

671
00:45:23,921 --> 00:45:27,448
We think
he may have gone to Muzaffarabad.

672
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:37,433
- Hello.
- Hey, Asra. It's John Bussey.

673
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:38,933
I just wanted
to give you guys the heads-up.

674
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:41,504
We got another e-mail
from the kidnappers.

675
00:46:09,133 --> 00:46:13,001
I have a message. I have a message.
I have a message.

676
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,866
Yes, I have a message.

677
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:17,406
I have three different points
I wanna talk about.

678
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:19,373
Mariane, how's it going in there?

679
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:22,240
- Good. I'm coming.
- Okay.

680
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:29,110
- Okay. You look great.
- Thanks.

681
00:46:30,087 --> 00:46:31,679
One moment.

682
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:39,525
That's good, that's great.

683
00:46:39,663 --> 00:46:41,927
- Asra, come on. We should go.
- Yeah.

684
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:45,101
It's Danny's.

685
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,905
Okay, let's go.

686
00:46:55,012 --> 00:46:56,604
That's perfect.

687
00:46:57,781 --> 00:47:01,547
Jesus Christ.
Come on, you guys, let's go. Come on.

688
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,214
Come on, help us push.

689
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:07,684
Watch your toes, John.

690
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:11,592
Yeah, we'll give you a holler, you get in.

691
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:15,997
There we go.

692
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:22,669
One question?

693
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:33,542
You know, emphasize the baby.

694
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:37,677
Emphasize the fact that you and Danny
are both journalists working here.

695
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:38,812
Okay.

696
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:42,824
- Bussey, she's fine. Just relax.
- Okay.

697
00:47:48,799 --> 00:47:52,291
Mrs. Pearl,
the group holding your husband

698
00:47:52,402 --> 00:47:57,430
has given a 24-hour deadline for the
United States to meet their demands

699
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:00,977
or else they say
that they'll kill your husband Daniel.

700
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:05,276
Do you have a message to that group?

701
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:08,010
Yeah, I have a message.

702
00:48:08,118 --> 00:48:11,053
Three different points
I wanna talk about.

703
00:48:11,154 --> 00:48:14,487
The first one
is that I want to remind them

704
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,855
that my husband and I
are both journalists.

705
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,225
We are two people who met
and fell in love

706
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:22,594
because we have the same ideal.

707
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:24,428
He's someone who...

708
00:48:25,002 --> 00:48:27,630
I never saw him say a lie.

709
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:31,606
In his journalism,
I've never seen anyone so honest.

710
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:35,110
And how are you coping with this?

711
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:42,112
I haven't slept for six days
if that's what you're asking.

712
00:48:43,153 --> 00:48:44,677
But I have hope.

713
00:48:44,788 --> 00:48:46,153
I'm not desperate

714
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:51,091
because I believe that if I stop trying
to create this dialogue,

715
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:55,790
then I stop believing in everything else
and I can't do that.

716
00:48:55,899 --> 00:48:57,059
I'm pregnant.

717
00:48:57,167 --> 00:49:02,730
And if you could say one thing to your
husband now, what would you tell him?

718
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:04,329
I love you.

719
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:10,243
Yeah, okay. Let's cut there.
Thank you so much.

720
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:12,573
Thank you.

721
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:15,644
- All right.
- Thank you. Great.

722
00:49:15,752 --> 00:49:19,153
- Great, Holly.
- Thank you, John. I'll ring you.

723
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:22,988
I like the fact
that you held yourself together.

724
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:27,223
You wouldn't know her husband
has been kidnapped for six days.

725
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:43,635
We gotta figure out a way
to get Mariane to eat more.

726
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:45,738
I think it's important for her.
For her health.

727
00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:48,647
She's a pregnant woman,
she's gotta feed this baby.

728
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:50,617
Just so you know,
I'm not a very good cook.

729
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:53,554
You know, maybe it's a matter
of if we're all eating together.

730
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:58,928
"You cannot fool us and find us.

731
00:49:59,029 --> 00:50:03,693
"We're inside seas, oceans,
hills, graveyards, everywhere.

732
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,267
"This cycle will continue

733
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:08,532
"and no American journalist
could enter Pakistan. "

734
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:12,801
With respect to Mr. Pearl, we're deeply
concerned about his safety

735
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:15,742
and our hearts go out to his family,

736
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,939
and I know that his colleagues
at the Wall Street Journal

737
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:19,640
are deeply concerned.

738
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:24,210
We're doing everything we can
to try to locate him and rescue him.

739
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:28,724
I have spoken
to President Musharraf in Pakistan

740
00:50:28,825 --> 00:50:33,489
about the situation and I know
that he's doing everything he can.

741
00:50:33,597 --> 00:50:35,997
The demands that the
kidnappers have placed

742
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:40,229
are not demands that we
can meet or deal with

743
00:50:40,337 --> 00:50:43,204
or get into a negotiation about.

744
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:48,141
The detainees at Guantanamo
are being treated humanely.

745
00:50:52,015 --> 00:50:53,915
I love you.

746
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:57,118
I love you.

747
00:50:58,121 --> 00:51:00,055
I love you.

748
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,925
Don't you collapse now.

749
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:08,855
Everybody else can collapse
but not you. Don't you collapse.

750
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:14,426
The Pakistani authorities are very,
well, they're very embarrassed by this

751
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:19,271
and they are not gonna go easy on
the bad guys, I'll tell you that right now.

752
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:23,140
I mean, the methods they use over here,

753
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:26,704
these guys are gonna tell us
what we wanna know.

754
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:28,444
I'd like a front-row seat

755
00:51:28,552 --> 00:51:32,545
when they hang them up by their feet
and beat them with sticks.

756
00:51:39,229 --> 00:51:41,197
Right, goodnight.

757
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:44,631
And we'll see you,
you stay all night, yeah?

758
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:46,793
You stay? Yeah?
All night?

759
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:37,516
Put here, please.
Thank you.

760
00:52:39,022 --> 00:52:41,286
- So we have a chef?
- Yes.

761
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:46,251
John got him from Mr. Bauman.
He normally works at the US Consulate.

762
00:52:48,431 --> 00:52:51,161
"Baffling questions
about Indian lady in Pearl case. "

763
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:52,895
That is the perfect word for Asra.

764
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:56,029
"Security agencies
are probing several baffling questions

765
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:59,802
"pertaining to the Indian Muslim lady,
Asra Q. Nomani. "

766
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:01,070
Is there a photo of me there?

767
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,975
"Miss Nomani is staying at a house
in Karachi

768
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:06,207
"that the latter
got on a monthly rental of Rs. 40,000."

769
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:08,341
They're putting
how much rent I'm paying?

770
00:53:08,451 --> 00:53:10,078
- Rs. 40,000?
- Yeah.

771
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:13,315
"As her address in India,
with her phone number 91-223... "

772
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:15,391
- What?
- It has my address?

773
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:17,187
How can they get
that kind of information?

774
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:18,386
It's obvious.

775
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:21,760
Security agencies. Who else?
That's their job, they're doing their job.

776
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:25,028
- You better change your phone number.
- It's a Pakistan and India thing.

777
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:34,705
What do you think of this, Shabir?

778
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:41,016
He is saying God is raining.
God is coming down with the rain.

779
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:55,531
This is the main attraction.

780
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:58,294
- You want me to carve it?
- I believe you're good with a knife.

781
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:01,529
The American Consul really knows
how to survive in Pakistan.

782
00:54:01,638 --> 00:54:02,832
Let's enjoy our food.

783
00:54:02,939 --> 00:54:05,464
This is a Cotes du Rhone.
1929 Cotes du Rhone.

784
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:07,065
Wow, vinegar.

785
00:54:30,867 --> 00:54:33,495
Steve's a good name.
Because you've got Stephen.

786
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:37,835
You've got Steve, you've got Stevie.
Jonathan, Jon, Jonny.

787
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,636
- Formal, nickname, sex name.
- So, it'll be like...

788
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:41,973
You know what's pretty is Alison.

789
00:54:42,078 --> 00:54:45,570
- Ali, Alison, Al, for instance.
- Jonny's like a little boy's name.

790
00:54:45,682 --> 00:54:47,809
- Theresa.
- You know, it's really old-fashioned.

791
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:49,817
- Mother Theresa.
- No.

792
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:53,823
- Hey, Captain, what's up?
- I'm afraid there's bad news.

793
00:54:53,923 --> 00:54:55,515
What is it?

794
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,525
Danny's body has been found.

795
00:54:57,627 --> 00:54:59,993
- He's in the morgue.
- Fuck.

796
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:02,427
Dost is on his way to collect you.

797
00:55:02,532 --> 00:55:03,897
- Okay, thank you.
- What?

798
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,027
We've gotta get over there.
Better get the guy here before we go.

799
00:55:08,705 --> 00:55:09,967
Fuck!

800
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:13,632
Where's the guy?
Where's the waiter guy?

801
00:55:13,743 --> 00:55:17,679
John, fuck the bill.
What are you fucking talking about?

802
00:55:18,114 --> 00:55:20,139
Fuck!

803
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:23,885
What did he say?
What did Captain say?

804
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:26,547
He said they've got the body
in the morgue.

805
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:30,490
I come to you with a tragic development
in the case of Daniel Pearl,

806
00:55:30,593 --> 00:55:34,495
the Wall Street Journal reporter
who's been missing for 10 days.

807
00:55:34,597 --> 00:55:38,465
According to Karachi police,
we can confirm now that he is dead.

808
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:42,800
His body was found dumped outside
of a car in downtown Karachi.

809
00:55:42,906 --> 00:55:45,170
He had several bullet wounds.

810
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:58,216
Can you open the mouth?

811
00:56:01,725 --> 00:56:04,660
- It's not Danny.
- What do you mean it's not Danny?

812
00:56:04,761 --> 00:56:06,092
Well, he's got braces in his mouth...

813
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:07,527
That's not fucking Danny.

814
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:09,860
- What?
- It's not fucking Danny.

815
00:56:15,238 --> 00:56:16,330
So wait, wait. I'm sorry.

816
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:17,997
Are you doubting the fact
that I saw this?

817
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:21,475
Are you actually asking me
to get you a second source?

818
00:56:21,578 --> 00:56:24,809
Hello? Yeah, it's not
fucking Danny.

819
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:30,184
No, it's a fucking Iranian student,
for God's sakes.

820
00:56:30,286 --> 00:56:31,548
It is not Danny.

821
00:56:31,654 --> 00:56:33,952
- Are you coming over?
- Yeah.

822
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:38,524
I just wanted to get you,
well, you should know.

823
00:56:38,628 --> 00:56:39,652
All right, okay.

824
00:56:39,763 --> 00:56:44,166
I can't believe that they just
announced it without any confirmation.

825
00:56:44,267 --> 00:56:46,098
Yeah, in the middle
of Super Bowl Sunday.

826
00:56:46,202 --> 00:56:47,897
I can't imagine who
those sources were.

827
00:56:48,004 --> 00:56:49,869
Everyone's calling the
Journal for a quote.

828
00:56:49,973 --> 00:56:52,203
- It's not Danny, you know that?
- I know.

829
00:56:52,308 --> 00:56:54,276
I've been talking to the Journal.

830
00:56:54,377 --> 00:56:56,242
Just, you know, be strong.

831
00:56:56,346 --> 00:56:58,507
I know. We will be.

832
00:57:21,336 --> 00:57:24,772
Who's this gentleman Daniel Pearl
you keep mentioning again and again?

833
00:57:24,873 --> 00:57:27,569
I'm not asking you about
his whereabouts, I just want to know...

834
00:57:27,676 --> 00:57:28,665
I don't know.

835
00:57:28,777 --> 00:57:32,440
I've told you earlier,
I've never heard of this man before.

836
00:57:32,548 --> 00:57:35,039
I'm saying, what's your
opinion about his articles?

837
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:38,347
I've never read his articles.
What are you trying to get at?

838
00:57:38,454 --> 00:57:41,252
No, we have the mails which says,

839
00:57:41,356 --> 00:57:43,290
"I spoke to Sheikh's secretary yesterday

840
00:57:43,392 --> 00:57:46,452
"and he told me
that Sheikh Sahib has read your articles

841
00:57:46,562 --> 00:57:48,587
"and that
you are welcome to meet him. "

842
00:57:48,697 --> 00:57:50,426
You gave the appointment.

843
00:57:50,532 --> 00:57:53,524
You read the articles.
It says Bashir wrote to Daniel.

844
00:57:53,635 --> 00:57:57,230
Bashir wrote to Daniel Pearl,
why don't you ask Bashir?

845
00:57:58,807 --> 00:58:00,274
Why don't you ask him?

846
00:58:06,582 --> 00:58:07,810
Mariane?

847
00:58:09,585 --> 00:58:11,382
We have caught Gilani.

848
00:58:11,487 --> 00:58:13,717
He was in Muzaffarabad
but he is here now.

849
00:58:13,822 --> 00:58:17,280
- What did he say?
- He's not involved.

850
00:58:17,392 --> 00:58:19,087
Wait, wait, wait.

851
00:58:20,128 --> 00:58:22,028
I thought Gilani was the guy?

852
00:58:22,698 --> 00:58:24,791
He was just the bait.

853
00:58:25,434 --> 00:58:27,527
He was used as a bait.

854
00:58:30,572 --> 00:58:33,507
- So, there's no Gilani involved?
- No.

855
00:58:33,942 --> 00:58:36,638
We go back to Arif,
we go back to Siddique and Bashir.

856
00:58:36,745 --> 00:58:40,408
I don't see this as a negative
thing, I have to say.

857
00:58:40,516 --> 00:58:41,505
This is a set-up.

858
00:58:41,617 --> 00:58:43,312
I mean, if Gilani has nothing
to do with this

859
00:58:43,418 --> 00:58:46,478
- some of these letters are bogus.
- It's worse than that.

860
00:58:46,588 --> 00:58:49,455
It means that they've been
planning something for weeks.

861
00:58:49,558 --> 00:58:53,221
And for weeks he thinks he's meeting
with Gilani and there is no Gilani.

862
00:58:53,328 --> 00:58:54,317
And whoever these people are,

863
00:58:54,429 --> 00:58:57,364
they're thinking about
doing this for weeks.

864
00:58:59,902 --> 00:59:02,200
It is disappointing.

865
00:59:02,304 --> 00:59:05,432
It's just taking away one piece,
I don't see this as a negative thing.

866
00:59:05,541 --> 00:59:08,669
It's not a dead end,
I think it's quite the contrary.

867
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:21,956
Well, now, the good news is Zafir and
Farooq have traced one of the e-mails.

868
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:28,027
It was sent from a server
in Noman City Apartments.

869
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:31,722
There's a team of people
who are searching for the computer

870
00:59:31,833 --> 00:59:35,667
that was using the server
when the kidnapper e-mail was sent.

871
00:59:52,654 --> 00:59:54,053
What's your name?

872
00:59:54,756 --> 00:59:56,018
Farhad Naseem.

873
00:59:56,158 --> 00:59:57,420
Is this computer yours?

874
00:59:57,526 --> 01:00:00,359
- This computer is mine.
- Turn it on, please.

875
01:00:00,762 --> 01:00:04,289
It can't be switched on
because the hard disk has crashed.

876
01:00:04,399 --> 01:00:05,764
What happened to the hard disk?

877
01:00:05,867 --> 01:00:07,562
There was a virus on it
and it crashed.

878
01:00:07,669 --> 01:00:09,637
I took it to repair two days ago.

879
01:00:09,738 --> 01:00:11,831
- It broke down two days ago?
- Yes.

880
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:12,929
Okay.

881
01:00:16,144 --> 01:00:17,133
Take him in.

882
01:00:19,247 --> 01:00:21,238
How many computers
have you connected in that building?

883
01:00:22,117 --> 01:00:23,812
In that building, twenty or more.

884
01:00:23,919 --> 01:00:25,318
- Twenty?
- Yes.

885
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:26,614
Is this your job?

886
01:00:27,089 --> 01:00:28,488
Yes, this is what I do.

887
01:00:29,157 --> 01:00:32,183
We are looking
for Daniel Pearl's photograph.

888
01:00:34,529 --> 01:00:36,520
We have new software

889
01:00:36,632 --> 01:00:39,624
that can recover deleted files
from your hard drive

890
01:00:39,735 --> 01:00:41,498
just like that.

891
01:00:43,438 --> 01:00:47,033
Whatever you know, just tell us now.
You won't have any difficulties.

892
01:00:47,142 --> 01:00:49,167
If the Americans find out,
you'll be in big trouble

893
01:00:49,277 --> 01:00:50,539
and we won't be able to help you.

894
01:00:50,912 --> 01:00:53,312
There was no-one else?
You did it on your own?

895
01:00:53,415 --> 01:00:55,781
No, sir, my cousin
Suleiman was with me.

896
01:00:56,251 --> 01:00:57,582
- Okay, he's your cousin?
- Yes.

897
01:00:57,686 --> 01:00:58,914
Where does he live?

898
01:00:59,021 --> 01:01:00,545
- He lives in Karachi.
- Is he in Karachi now?

899
01:01:00,656 --> 01:01:02,385
- Yes.
- Come on, let's go.

900
01:01:02,491 --> 01:01:03,480
Well done.

901
01:01:05,327 --> 01:01:07,852
In the morning prayer,
everybody will come to know.

902
01:01:07,963 --> 01:01:10,625
So we have to find Danny tonight.

903
01:01:10,732 --> 01:01:11,790
Quickly, quickly.

904
01:01:19,441 --> 01:01:20,465
This is the place.

905
01:01:30,552 --> 01:01:31,849
There he is.

906
01:01:33,855 --> 01:01:35,618
That's him.

907
01:01:37,626 --> 01:01:39,218
Yes, he's the one.

908
01:01:54,676 --> 01:01:55,768
Come on, move it.

909
01:02:02,884 --> 01:02:04,442
Get out of the way.

910
01:02:30,479 --> 01:02:31,468
Give me his phone.

911
01:02:34,916 --> 01:02:36,781
Tell him what I told you to say.

912
01:02:41,990 --> 01:02:42,979
It's Suleiman.

913
01:02:45,594 --> 01:02:46,856
Hello?

914
01:02:48,263 --> 01:02:50,754
- He says he's not there.
- Do you have his cell number?

915
01:02:50,866 --> 01:02:52,834
- Yes.
- Then let's try it.

916
01:02:53,401 --> 01:02:54,459
Be quiet.

917
01:02:57,239 --> 01:02:58,536
Suleiman speaking.

918
01:02:59,508 --> 01:03:02,238
- What do you want?
- I need to speak to you.

919
01:03:02,344 --> 01:03:05,279
I need to meet you urgently.

920
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:09,043
Not now. We'll meet up early
tomorrow morning and talk. Okay?

921
01:03:09,518 --> 01:03:11,452
Hello? Hello, Adil?

922
01:03:13,321 --> 01:03:15,217
Sir, he's saying we'll
speak tomorrow.

923
01:03:15,323 --> 01:03:17,018
Take down this number.

924
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:19,249
Open the door.

925
01:03:19,895 --> 01:03:21,920
Sir, this is the phone company.

926
01:03:22,731 --> 01:03:24,722
Yeah, this is Javed Habib,
CID Chief.

927
01:03:24,833 --> 01:03:29,065
I need some information about the last
phone call made on this phone.

928
01:03:31,773 --> 01:03:35,402
Which cell tower received a signal
on the last phone call?

929
01:03:37,879 --> 01:03:40,143
We don't have any time, you bastard.

930
01:03:40,682 --> 01:03:42,582
Let's go. Let's go.

931
01:03:43,652 --> 01:03:45,882
Yeah, Randall, come along.

932
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:53,027
CID!

933
01:03:57,766 --> 01:03:58,926
Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.

934
01:03:59,034 --> 01:04:00,626
We need to trace a number.

935
01:04:01,303 --> 01:04:04,568
Sorry, sir, the office is closed, we can't
give you any information right now.

936
01:04:04,673 --> 01:04:07,164
What do you need
to do with this number?

937
01:04:07,275 --> 01:04:09,470
I am CID Chief Javed Habib.

938
01:04:09,578 --> 01:04:11,102
You know what I can do?

939
01:04:11,213 --> 01:04:13,238
Screw your confidentiality,
I need that information.

940
01:04:13,348 --> 01:04:15,077
A man has been kidnapped, a foreigner.

941
01:04:15,183 --> 01:04:17,174
If something happens to him,
Pakistan will have a bad reputation.

942
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:21,318
- You okay?
- Yeah, man.

943
01:04:21,423 --> 01:04:24,324
We just have to go a little careful
with this one.

944
01:04:24,426 --> 01:04:26,326
- Why?
- Oh, he's a Jihadi.

945
01:04:26,428 --> 01:04:27,725
He was in Afghanistan.

946
01:04:27,829 --> 01:04:30,525
- He's a police officer as well.
- In my unit.

947
01:04:30,632 --> 01:04:33,829
Oh, God. I love this town.

948
01:04:55,757 --> 01:04:57,247
- Who's there?
- Don't move.

949
01:04:58,994 --> 01:05:00,962
- Put your hands up.
- Take him away.

950
01:05:01,062 --> 01:05:02,154
You'll be sorry.

951
01:05:02,898 --> 01:05:03,990
God is great.

952
01:05:05,066 --> 01:05:06,090
God is great.

953
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:25,308
Where is Daniel Pearl?

954
01:05:26,621 --> 01:05:27,610
I don't know.

955
01:05:28,256 --> 01:05:29,245
What do you know?

956
01:05:30,158 --> 01:05:31,147
I don't know anything.

957
01:05:34,262 --> 01:05:36,025
Tell me whatever you know.

958
01:05:41,036 --> 01:05:42,594
I don't know anything.

959
01:05:45,941 --> 01:05:46,930
What do you know?

960
01:05:54,349 --> 01:05:55,338
What do you know?

961
01:05:55,817 --> 01:05:56,806
Just tell me.

962
01:05:58,153 --> 01:05:59,347
What do you know?

963
01:06:00,622 --> 01:06:01,680
What did you do?

964
01:06:02,324 --> 01:06:03,313
I don't know anything.

965
01:06:03,425 --> 01:06:05,450
- What do you know?
- Nothing.

966
01:06:11,866 --> 01:06:13,925
- What do you know?
- Nothing.

967
01:06:18,606 --> 01:06:20,039
Who asked you to e-mail?

968
01:06:26,748 --> 01:06:27,840
Who are you working for?

969
01:06:28,717 --> 01:06:29,877
Who asked you to e-mail?

970
01:06:30,685 --> 01:06:32,277
Sheikh Omar.

971
01:06:49,838 --> 01:06:52,898
- Dost, come in.
- I'm here, Captain.

972
01:07:32,347 --> 01:07:33,336
Quickly, come on.

973
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:40,448
Check all the rooms.

974
01:07:41,689 --> 01:07:43,350
Search everything.

975
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:46,354
Who are you people?

976
01:07:46,461 --> 01:07:48,725
Is this the way to come into
respectable people's homes?

977
01:07:49,564 --> 01:07:50,826
Where's Sheikh Omar?

978
01:07:50,932 --> 01:07:52,456
You must have a contact number.

979
01:07:52,567 --> 01:07:56,526
Nine-zero-seven-zero
two-seven-two-six.

980
01:07:56,938 --> 01:07:58,269
Where is Sheikh Omar?

981
01:07:58,373 --> 01:08:00,466
- We don't know anything.
- Give me Adil's phone.

982
01:08:00,575 --> 01:08:01,564
Come on.

983
01:08:01,676 --> 01:08:02,870
Give me Adil's phone.

984
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:07,905
We've got Omar's number.

985
01:08:21,763 --> 01:08:23,025
Hello?

986
01:08:23,531 --> 01:08:24,520
Omar Sheikh?

987
01:08:25,934 --> 01:08:26,923
Yes?

988
01:08:27,502 --> 01:08:29,663
It's Javed Habib speaking,
Omar Sheikh.

989
01:08:30,371 --> 01:08:33,602
We have all the information,
we know everything about you.

990
01:08:34,375 --> 01:08:37,606
Farhad, Adil, Suleiman,
we have all of them.

991
01:08:37,712 --> 01:08:39,179
Check your caller ID.

992
01:08:48,456 --> 01:08:50,117
He's cut the phone.

993
01:09:03,271 --> 01:09:04,966
Come on, bring them out.

994
01:09:16,317 --> 01:09:19,809
Adil told us
that he met Omar in Afghanistan.

995
01:09:19,921 --> 01:09:24,756
Suddenly I realized
Bashir was Omar Saeed Sheikh.

996
01:09:24,859 --> 01:09:26,793
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

997
01:09:26,895 --> 01:09:31,628
The FBI found Danny's photos
on this guy Farhad's computer

998
01:09:31,733 --> 01:09:35,066
who is the key to Sheikh Omar.

999
01:09:35,170 --> 01:09:38,401
So we've had this article
and we just put it away

1000
01:09:38,506 --> 01:09:40,406
and it was about Omar Saeed Sheikh.

1001
01:09:40,508 --> 01:09:41,975
I have it here somewhere.

1002
01:09:42,076 --> 01:09:44,067
Okay, look, here it is, here it is.

1003
01:09:44,179 --> 01:09:48,878
"British born and educated.
A known Jihadist.

1004
01:09:48,983 --> 01:09:52,817
"Arrested for kidnapping
four tourists in India,

1005
01:09:52,921 --> 01:09:54,786
"one American, three British.

1006
01:09:54,889 --> 01:09:57,790
"The four were freed unharmed. "

1007
01:09:57,892 --> 01:09:59,382
- They were freed unharmed?
- Yeah.

1008
01:09:59,494 --> 01:10:01,519
So this guy is a serious, serious player.

1009
01:10:01,629 --> 01:10:04,097
He was arrested in 1994
for this kidnapping

1010
01:10:04,199 --> 01:10:08,861
and put in an Indian prison until 1999.

1011
01:10:09,070 --> 01:10:12,130
- Why was he released?
- There was a hostage swap.

1012
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:15,835
An Indian airplane was hijacked
and flown to Afghanistan.

1013
01:10:15,944 --> 01:10:17,775
He's Al Qaeda.

1014
01:10:17,879 --> 01:10:20,541
He has connections,
yes, we know. But...

1015
01:10:21,382 --> 01:10:25,409
Close connection, it says, to Al Qaeda.

1016
01:10:28,089 --> 01:10:30,785
We arrested his two cousins.

1017
01:10:30,892 --> 01:10:33,952
We will fight kidnappers
with kidnappings.

1018
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:30,479
Are you okay?

1019
01:11:30,585 --> 01:11:33,611
- Mariane, what's wrong?
- Yeah, I'm all right. I'm all right.

1020
01:11:33,721 --> 01:11:34,983
Fuck.

1021
01:11:37,125 --> 01:11:39,389
Are you okay?

1022
01:11:43,364 --> 01:11:46,356
Fetal heart sound and the
blood pressure is quite normal.

1023
01:11:46,467 --> 01:11:49,664
I will give you some medicine.
You will feel definitely better. Okay?

1024
01:11:49,771 --> 01:11:51,671
Okay. Thank you.

1025
01:11:51,773 --> 01:11:54,435
"Making a habit of not urinating
when you feel the need

1026
01:11:54,542 --> 01:11:58,569
"increases the risk that your inflamed
bladder may irritate the uterus

1027
01:11:58,680 --> 01:11:59,806
"and set off contractions.

1028
01:11:59,914 --> 01:12:02,246
"So don't hold it in. "

1029
01:12:02,684 --> 01:12:04,982
- I'll remember that.
- That was in caps.

1030
01:12:05,086 --> 01:12:07,680
- So don't hold it in.
- So don't hold it in.

1031
01:12:08,456 --> 01:12:11,516
Do you wanna go share
those notes with Mariane?

1032
01:12:11,626 --> 01:12:12,593
Do you think I should?

1033
01:12:12,694 --> 01:12:13,991
Is there anything on breast-feeding?

1034
01:12:14,095 --> 01:12:16,461
There's a lot on breast-feeding
but we're not there yet, Steve.

1035
01:12:16,564 --> 01:12:18,293
Do you have kids?

1036
01:12:18,866 --> 01:12:20,128
No.

1037
01:12:33,181 --> 01:12:34,944
Come on, look happy.

1038
01:12:35,850 --> 01:12:38,842
Right, you're a happy girl.
Happy girl.

1039
01:12:38,986 --> 01:12:42,888
There it is. Now I can tell all my friends
that you are happy.

1040
01:12:51,799 --> 01:12:54,791
You can get old and fat
and gray and grumpy.

1041
01:12:54,902 --> 01:12:57,598
- And curvy.
- But don't lose your smile.

1042
01:13:09,917 --> 01:13:11,179
Oh, shit.

1043
01:13:13,588 --> 01:13:15,453
It does smell like that picture.

1044
01:13:15,556 --> 01:13:17,581
You're so uncultured.

1045
01:13:17,692 --> 01:13:20,422
There's a potential
new e-mail from CNN.

1046
01:13:23,097 --> 01:13:26,032
"We had informed the US if our
demands were not met within 24 hours

1047
01:13:26,134 --> 01:13:27,226
"we would kill Daniel Pearl.

1048
01:13:27,335 --> 01:13:29,496
"Now Mr. Bush can find his body
in the graveyards of Karachi.

1049
01:13:29,604 --> 01:13:30,696
"We have thrown him there. "

1050
01:13:35,810 --> 01:13:40,270
- Do we think it's another hoax?
- Get all the phones on silent, shall we?

1051
01:13:42,550 --> 01:13:44,381
Let me call Captain.

1052
01:14:51,219 --> 01:14:53,312
Why Danny?

1053
01:14:53,421 --> 01:14:54,718
The Journal, a few weeks ago,

1054
01:14:54,822 --> 01:14:57,313
handed over to the CIA a computer

1055
01:14:57,425 --> 01:14:59,916
which had information
about Richard Reid

1056
01:15:00,027 --> 01:15:02,325
and his attempts to blow up
the American Airline flight.

1057
01:15:02,430 --> 01:15:05,490
And then you guys
told everyone that you did that.

1058
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:07,534
Mariane, look at this.

1059
01:15:07,902 --> 01:15:11,702
The Wall Street Journal is telling
everybody it's co-operating with the CIA.

1060
01:15:11,806 --> 01:15:15,606
We turned the computer over
because we had no choice.

1061
01:15:15,710 --> 01:15:17,337
- Okay. Okay.
- It was a matter of national security.

1062
01:15:17,445 --> 01:15:20,642
To an outsider it could look like
the CIA are in bed with the Journal.

1063
01:15:20,748 --> 01:15:22,978
So, what, you think it's no factor?
Just ignore it?

1064
01:15:23,084 --> 01:15:26,053
I don't think Danny was taken because
he worked for the Wall Street Journal.

1065
01:15:26,153 --> 01:15:27,142
We don't know.

1066
01:15:27,255 --> 01:15:30,486
They know where he works
and they say CIA. It's something.

1067
01:15:30,591 --> 01:15:33,617
Let's be honest about it,
they call everybody a spy.

1068
01:15:33,728 --> 01:15:38,358
If you're an Indian in Pakistan,
you must be an Indian spy.

1069
01:15:38,466 --> 01:15:40,593
All right, here's what I think.

1070
01:15:40,701 --> 01:15:42,931
Two days before Danny
was kidnapped

1071
01:15:43,037 --> 01:15:46,598
the US asked Pakistan
to hand over Omar Saeed Sheikh.

1072
01:15:46,707 --> 01:15:51,644
Now, Omar was supposed to have sent
money to Mohammed Atta prior to 9/11.

1073
01:15:51,746 --> 01:15:52,940
Now, rumors are

1074
01:15:53,047 --> 01:15:56,278
that this money came from
Lieutenant General Mahmood Ahmed

1075
01:15:56,384 --> 01:15:58,511
who was the head of the ISI.

1076
01:15:58,619 --> 01:16:02,214
Now, on October 7th,
Musharraf dismissed the General.

1077
01:16:02,990 --> 01:16:05,686
Now, was that
because of his involvement?

1078
01:16:13,801 --> 01:16:15,029
- Hello?
- Mariane?

1079
01:16:15,136 --> 01:16:18,003
- Yes?
- We've got Omar Saeed Sheikh.

1080
01:16:27,148 --> 01:16:29,275
Is Daniel Pearl still alive?

1081
01:16:31,352 --> 01:16:33,252
I haven't a clue.

1082
01:16:37,091 --> 01:16:39,059
Do you know where he is?

1083
01:16:40,428 --> 01:16:42,396
I wish I could help you.

1084
01:16:47,301 --> 01:16:49,132
Who is holding him?

1085
01:16:49,236 --> 01:16:51,136
I don't know.

1086
01:16:54,108 --> 01:16:56,804
That was the whole point
of the operation,

1087
01:16:56,911 --> 01:16:59,744
so that each person
knows as little as possible.

1088
01:16:59,847 --> 01:17:01,781
Why did you kidnap him?

1089
01:17:02,583 --> 01:17:05,416
- Why?
- Why did you kidnap him?

1090
01:17:07,121 --> 01:17:10,113
- He was an American.
- He was an American? Just that?

1091
01:17:10,224 --> 01:17:11,248
Yeah.

1092
01:17:11,359 --> 01:17:13,987
You think you are a good Muslim?

1093
01:17:16,263 --> 01:17:20,222
At least I have the strength
to stand for something I believe in,

1094
01:17:20,334 --> 01:17:23,030
unlike others in this room.

1095
01:17:23,871 --> 01:17:25,338
How old is your son?

1096
01:17:25,439 --> 01:17:27,805
He's a baby, Captain.
Cute little baby.

1097
01:17:27,908 --> 01:17:30,001
- You miss him?
- Desperately.

1098
01:17:31,012 --> 01:17:33,242
You want to see him?

1099
01:17:33,347 --> 01:17:37,340
Inshallah, if Allah wills then
it will be so.

1100
01:17:37,451 --> 01:17:39,919
- What about your baby?
- We can arrange for that.

1101
01:17:40,021 --> 01:17:43,457
Do you want to see your baby grow old?

1102
01:17:48,929 --> 01:17:53,298
Omar Saeed Sheikh handed himself in
over a week ago, on February the 5th.

1103
01:17:53,401 --> 01:17:56,495
It was the same night that
the raid was made on his aunt's house.

1104
01:17:56,604 --> 01:17:58,697
Where has he been?

1105
01:17:58,806 --> 01:18:02,401
He handed himself
in to Brigadier Ejaz Shah.

1106
01:18:02,510 --> 01:18:04,375
He is the Home Secretary of Punjab.

1107
01:18:04,478 --> 01:18:06,139
This guy is ex-ISI.

1108
01:18:06,247 --> 01:18:11,184
He's connected to Omar's family and he
kept Omar's arrest a secret for a week.

1109
01:18:12,319 --> 01:18:16,483
- Was he being interrogated by the ISI?
- We don't know.

1110
01:18:16,590 --> 01:18:19,388
Omar is gone for a week?
He's gone for a week?

1111
01:18:19,493 --> 01:18:20,619
What does he say about Danny?

1112
01:18:20,728 --> 01:18:23,993
He doesn't say anything
about that. Yet.

1113
01:18:28,069 --> 01:18:29,934
- Mariane?
- What?

1114
01:18:44,518 --> 01:18:46,577
British-born militant Sheikh Omar

1115
01:18:46,687 --> 01:18:49,986
arrived at court heavily guarded,
his face covered.

1116
01:18:53,894 --> 01:18:56,920
Do you know
where Daniel Pearl is being held?

1117
01:18:57,031 --> 01:18:58,362
No, I don't.

1118
01:18:58,466 --> 01:19:02,232
Do you know if Daniel Pearl is alive?

1119
01:19:03,671 --> 01:19:05,195
As far as I know

1120
01:19:06,774 --> 01:19:08,071
he is not alive.

1121
01:19:09,143 --> 01:19:11,976
On February 5th,
I spoke to my brothers on the phone

1122
01:19:12,113 --> 01:19:15,014
and I told them
to take the patient to the doctor's.

1123
01:19:15,649 --> 01:19:18,413
This was a code to release the hostage.

1124
01:19:18,786 --> 01:19:20,720
But it was too late.

1125
01:19:21,989 --> 01:19:23,923
So it's bullshit.

1126
01:19:24,258 --> 01:19:27,887
They're just liars,
they're just psychos and liars.

1127
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:44,737
I think if he was not alive,
with all the pressure that we are putting

1128
01:19:44,845 --> 01:19:47,336
I think we would have got his body
from somewhere.

1129
01:19:47,448 --> 01:19:51,817
And whatever Mr. Omar Sheikh lately
has said that maybe he's not alive,

1130
01:19:51,919 --> 01:19:52,943
I don't believe him.

1131
01:19:53,053 --> 01:19:54,315
He's been switching sides

1132
01:19:54,421 --> 01:19:56,514
and switching his statements
a number of times,

1133
01:19:56,624 --> 01:19:57,682
that is what I am told.

1134
01:19:57,792 --> 01:20:01,023
He may be trying to get
us off the track.

1135
01:20:02,463 --> 01:20:06,729
So I think really, maybe I hope
and I pray that he's alive.

1136
01:22:00,414 --> 01:22:03,042
Nuri, hello. It's Steve.

1137
01:22:04,685 --> 01:22:06,516
Peshawar, Pakistan.

1138
01:22:06,620 --> 01:22:08,554
As a Muslim and an ethnic Pashtun,

1139
01:22:08,656 --> 01:22:12,786
Fazal-e-Maula has some sympathy
for the ruling Taliban in Afghanistan.

1140
01:22:12,893 --> 01:22:15,453
But on September 11,
as he watched television replays

1141
01:22:15,562 --> 01:22:18,759
of airplanes crashing into
the World Trade Center in New York,

1142
01:22:18,866 --> 01:22:21,892
he knew what to do. Buy Afghanis.

1143
01:22:23,103 --> 01:22:25,503
- How's Nuri?
- She's good.

1144
01:22:25,606 --> 01:22:27,631
What's the due date?

1145
01:22:39,620 --> 01:22:42,714
Amazing you can love somebody
you've never met.

1146
01:22:54,401 --> 01:22:55,698
Hello?

1147
01:22:55,803 --> 01:22:57,668
Hello? Yes.

1148
01:22:59,540 --> 01:23:00,598
It's Danny's phone.

1149
01:23:00,708 --> 01:23:02,733
- They're speaking Urdu. Talk to them.
- Hello.

1150
01:23:02,843 --> 01:23:07,303
I would let you speak to her,
but she doesn't speak Urdu.

1151
01:23:08,949 --> 01:23:09,938
Okay?

1152
01:23:10,484 --> 01:23:13,078
Whatever you want.
Whatever you want.

1153
01:23:14,221 --> 01:23:16,621
No, he just hung up on me.

1154
01:23:16,724 --> 01:23:21,252
It's fine. They were making contact.
That's good, that's fine.

1155
01:23:21,362 --> 01:23:24,820
But they don't say what they want.
They don't say what they want.

1156
01:23:24,932 --> 01:23:28,390
No. They're still toying with us.
They know we're getting close.

1157
01:23:28,502 --> 01:23:30,470
Do you think they'll call back?

1158
01:23:30,571 --> 01:23:33,506
Well, unless we get to them first.

1159
01:23:41,382 --> 01:23:42,644
Sorry.

1160
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:45,048
Hello. John Bussey.

1161
01:23:45,152 --> 01:23:47,814
Yeah. Yeah. What?

1162
01:23:48,789 --> 01:23:52,190
No, don't bring them over there.
No, we'll come over there. Yeah.

1163
01:23:52,292 --> 01:23:54,453
- Who was it?
- Joe.

1164
01:23:55,329 --> 01:23:56,796
We gotta go.

1165
01:23:58,265 --> 01:24:00,597
Hey, Farhan, let's...

1166
01:24:08,809 --> 01:24:09,833
Where did they go?

1167
01:24:09,943 --> 01:24:13,902
They just got a phone call
and they had to go out.

1168
01:24:14,782 --> 01:24:16,943
I'm gonna get my phone.

1169
01:24:19,620 --> 01:24:21,952
I can't get through to Bussey.

1170
01:24:32,466 --> 01:24:33,865
I tried Bussey and I've tried Steve.

1171
01:24:33,967 --> 01:24:36,527
- I can't get through to either.
- Try Randall.

1172
01:24:37,337 --> 01:24:40,363
Okay, it's ringing.
Randall's phone is ringing.

1173
01:24:41,642 --> 01:24:42,973
Hi, Randall. It's Asra.

1174
01:24:43,077 --> 01:24:46,274
Can you call me as soon
as you get this message, please?

1175
01:24:51,452 --> 01:24:53,511
His line is not connecting.

1176
01:25:00,294 --> 01:25:01,921
Why would they do that?

1177
01:25:02,096 --> 01:25:05,031
- Hey, Steve.
- Hey, John, how are you?

1178
01:25:09,603 --> 01:25:11,332
- So what have you got?
- It's a tape.

1179
01:25:11,438 --> 01:25:13,099
We got it a half hour ago.

1180
01:25:13,207 --> 01:25:15,937
John was contacted
by a local journalist.

1181
01:25:29,756 --> 01:25:33,351
- Hi. Are you John?
- Yeah, I am. How are you doing?

1182
01:25:36,396 --> 01:25:38,523
Here is your thing.

1183
01:25:38,632 --> 01:25:40,099
It's original.

1184
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:42,498
- Have you seen it?
- Yeah.

1185
01:25:42,603 --> 01:25:45,094
- Be careful.
- Thanks.

1186
01:25:46,306 --> 01:25:48,934
Guy in the striped shirt. You see him?

1187
01:25:50,177 --> 01:25:52,737
We're gonna need to X-ray this.

1188
01:25:52,846 --> 01:25:54,871
Yeah, come on.

1189
01:25:58,619 --> 01:26:00,883
Is there a tape in there?

1190
01:26:04,224 --> 01:26:05,555
This is it.

1191
01:26:27,314 --> 01:26:29,214
Oh, my God.

1192
01:26:31,852 --> 01:26:34,548
It's Asra. Hello.

1193
01:26:34,655 --> 01:26:38,386
Hello. Randall.
It's Asra. Look, where are you?

1194
01:26:38,492 --> 01:26:40,824
- Hello. Hang on a second.
- What's going on? Randall?

1195
01:26:40,928 --> 01:26:42,122
Hello.

1196
01:26:42,729 --> 01:26:44,196
Hello.

1197
01:26:44,298 --> 01:26:45,890
I just lost her.

1198
01:26:47,234 --> 01:26:49,202
- He hung up.
- No, no.

1199
01:26:50,103 --> 01:26:52,196
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

1200
01:26:53,807 --> 01:26:57,174
- Will you call me a car?
- Where are you gonna go?

1201
01:26:57,277 --> 01:26:59,438
I don't know. Call me a car.

1202
01:27:43,190 --> 01:27:44,452
Mariane.

1203
01:27:47,628 --> 01:27:49,323
I'm sorry.

1204
01:27:51,265 --> 01:27:53,062
Danny didn't make it.

1205
01:28:24,231 --> 01:28:29,032
No!

1206
01:28:46,653 --> 01:28:50,783
No! No! No! No!

1207
01:29:01,968 --> 01:29:07,372
No! No!

1208
01:29:17,150 --> 01:29:20,381
No! No! No!

1209
01:29:21,822 --> 01:29:24,620
No! No! No! No!

1210
01:29:33,533 --> 01:29:35,023
How do you...

1211
01:29:37,237 --> 01:29:38,932
How do you know?

1212
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:42,169
How do you know?

1213
01:29:42,275 --> 01:29:44,334
No, because...

1214
01:29:44,444 --> 01:29:47,743
Because we've, you know,
been through this before.

1215
01:29:50,350 --> 01:29:52,716
- They can...
- We have a video.

1216
01:29:54,888 --> 01:29:59,120
They had a knife and they used it
in a way that leaves no doubt.

1217
01:30:08,835 --> 01:30:10,962
What does that mean?

1218
01:30:11,071 --> 01:30:12,333
Mariane...

1219
01:30:13,407 --> 01:30:15,307
He was beheaded.

1220
01:30:24,317 --> 01:30:28,845
Oh, God. No, no, no... What?
What? No, no.

1221
01:30:32,759 --> 01:30:35,023
You watched that?

1222
01:30:36,129 --> 01:30:39,223
I never, never want to see it!

1223
01:30:49,276 --> 01:30:51,767
Turn off the fucking phone!

1224
01:31:15,135 --> 01:31:17,035
I love you.

1225
01:31:56,243 --> 01:31:57,540
I'm here, Mariane.

1226
01:31:59,379 --> 01:32:03,577
The day my brother arrived
was the day of Eid-ul-Adha.

1227
01:32:03,683 --> 01:32:07,517
The day when every Muslim family
sacrifices an animal to God.

1228
01:32:07,621 --> 01:32:12,354
In remembrance of Ibrahim's
willingness to sacrifice his son Ishmael.

1229
01:32:17,130 --> 01:32:19,690
The meat is then
divided into three parts,

1230
01:32:19,799 --> 01:32:24,133
one for the family, one for the neighbor,
and one for the poor.

1231
01:32:25,472 --> 01:32:27,906
Mariane, thank you so much
for being with us today.

1232
01:32:28,008 --> 01:32:30,238
You came to Pakistan in peace.

1233
01:32:30,343 --> 01:32:33,312
You came here seeking the truth,
with your husband.

1234
01:32:33,413 --> 01:32:35,278
Now you leave Pakistan as a widow

1235
01:32:35,382 --> 01:32:37,543
after your husband
was brutally murdered.

1236
01:32:37,651 --> 01:32:41,178
What message do you have
for the people of Pakistan?

1237
01:32:41,288 --> 01:32:44,553
Danny was killed this month.

1238
01:32:45,258 --> 01:32:50,161
But also 10 other people
were killed by terrorists

1239
01:32:50,263 --> 01:32:52,424
and they were all Pakistani.

1240
01:32:52,532 --> 01:32:56,400
So they are suffering
as much as we are, right?

1241
01:32:56,503 --> 01:32:59,563
Well, how do you address some
Pakistanis who have sympathies

1242
01:32:59,673 --> 01:33:02,870
for militant groups such as those
who killed your husband?

1243
01:33:03,410 --> 01:33:10,179
Karachi is in some way
the front line of this battle.

1244
01:33:10,283 --> 01:33:13,980
It is not just a group
of extremist Pakistani.

1245
01:33:14,087 --> 01:33:17,818
It is a vast and international
network of terrorists.

1246
01:33:18,792 --> 01:33:22,660
And wherever there is misery,
they find people

1247
01:33:22,762 --> 01:33:27,028
and there is misery, you know,
in lots of parts of the world.

1248
01:33:27,133 --> 01:33:28,566
Certainly that may be the case,

1249
01:33:28,668 --> 01:33:32,729
but have you seen the videotape
of what they did to your husband?

1250
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:35,701
Have you no decency?

1251
01:33:37,911 --> 01:33:39,811
How do you ask me that?

1252
01:33:40,814 --> 01:33:42,076
Mariane, I'm...

1253
01:33:42,182 --> 01:33:43,206
Thank you for being with us today.

1254
01:33:43,316 --> 01:33:45,284
Okay, I think we're done.

1255
01:33:45,385 --> 01:33:47,853
- S-a-t-c-h-i.
- Satchi.

1256
01:33:47,954 --> 01:33:50,718
- That's okay.
- And a middle name, please, Satchi.

1257
01:34:01,835 --> 01:34:03,996
Okay. Excuse me.

1258
01:34:04,104 --> 01:34:06,504
I'm sorry. Back, back.

1259
01:34:08,308 --> 01:34:09,570
Is there another way out of here?

1260
01:34:09,676 --> 01:34:11,371
Yeah, I know another way.
Please follow me.

1261
01:34:11,478 --> 01:34:13,708
- Please. Come. This way.
- Okay.

1262
01:34:16,049 --> 01:34:17,744
Fucking mob.

1263
01:34:18,551 --> 01:34:20,041
- This way, please.
- Here?

1264
01:34:20,153 --> 01:34:21,848
Yeah. Sure. Yeah.

1265
01:34:22,455 --> 01:34:25,117
Thank you, Kasim. We
appreciate it. Thank you.

1266
01:34:25,759 --> 01:34:27,226
It's crazy, they're everywhere.

1267
01:34:41,808 --> 01:34:46,609
Pearl is 38 and graduated from Stanford
before beginning a career in journalism.

1268
01:34:46,713 --> 01:34:49,511
He joined the Wall Street
Journal in 1990.

1269
01:35:28,988 --> 01:35:30,478
That's great.

1270
01:35:33,326 --> 01:35:35,226
One more of these.

1271
01:35:41,034 --> 01:35:44,128
I just wanted
to say something to everybody.

1272
01:35:44,237 --> 01:35:46,705
I want to, I want to thank you

1273
01:35:47,474 --> 01:35:53,310
for all of your work and all of your effort

1274
01:35:53,413 --> 01:35:55,438
and your kindness

1275
01:35:55,548 --> 01:36:02,044
and I know how much you wanted
to find and bring Danny home.

1276
01:36:05,358 --> 01:36:08,054
You did not fail, you know?

1277
01:36:09,229 --> 01:36:14,724
Danny's dead, but the kidnappers,

1278
01:36:14,834 --> 01:36:19,430
their point is to terrorize people, right?

1279
01:36:19,539 --> 01:36:23,270
I am not terrorized.
And you can't be terrorized.

1280
01:36:23,376 --> 01:36:26,971
I am very grateful to all of you.
Very, very grateful. So thank you.

1281
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:28,980
So please, let's eat.

1282
01:36:41,661 --> 01:36:45,392
Everything looks very good. It's great.

1283
01:36:45,498 --> 01:36:47,090
This is terrific.

1284
01:37:18,331 --> 01:37:19,559
Bye.

1285
01:37:22,001 --> 01:37:23,798
Bye. Take care.

1286
01:37:23,903 --> 01:37:26,531
Thank you so much. Take care.

1287
01:37:26,639 --> 01:37:28,436
- Thanks.
- Bye.

1288
01:37:30,043 --> 01:37:32,204
All right. I'll see you.

1289
01:38:19,259 --> 01:38:20,453
Oh, my daughter.

1290
01:38:20,793 --> 01:38:22,226
You are so beautiful.

1291
01:38:29,235 --> 01:38:32,261
In Buddhism there is no god.

1292
01:38:32,438 --> 01:38:35,874
The aim of Buddhism
is to draw out all the strength,

1293
01:38:35,975 --> 01:38:39,138
courage, wisdom and goodwill.

1294
01:38:41,347 --> 01:38:44,111
You make me happy
every time you smile.

1295
01:38:45,451 --> 01:38:47,715
We're gonna create
a beautiful world together.

1296
01:38:51,491 --> 01:38:55,120
The wine represents joy.

1297
01:39:00,199 --> 01:39:04,693
The breaking of the glass
symbolizes the fragility of human joy.

1298
01:39:05,638 --> 01:39:08,573
And also the breaking of innocence.

1299
01:39:34,133 --> 01:39:36,897
They found Danny's body
cut into 10 pieces.

1300
01:39:37,870 --> 01:39:39,735
Nobody told me this.

1301
01:39:39,839 --> 01:39:41,204
I learned it in an e-mail

1302
01:39:41,307 --> 01:39:45,004
that was attached by accident
to another e-mail sent to me.

1303
01:39:48,948 --> 01:39:52,577
I decided that, before Adam is born,

1304
01:39:52,685 --> 01:39:56,052
I have to confront everything
that happened to Danny.

1305
01:40:17,076 --> 01:40:21,638
He was held in an isolated shack in a
compound on the outskirts of Karachi.

1306
01:40:22,515 --> 01:40:27,418
One day, when he was unshackled
to go to the toilet, he tried to escape.

1307
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:31,752
They caught him
and chained him to the engine of a car.

1308
01:40:31,858 --> 01:40:36,090
Another time he tried to break loose
when he was walking with his captors.

1309
01:40:36,195 --> 01:40:38,857
Once he shouted to a passerby.

1310
01:40:39,265 --> 01:40:43,258
Then, one day, probably February 1st,

1311
01:40:43,369 --> 01:40:46,998
three men who spoke Arabic
were brought to the compound.

1312
01:40:47,874 --> 01:40:53,073
Danny argued with one of them.
Then they turned on the video.

1313
01:40:55,448 --> 01:40:57,643
My name is Daniel Pearl.

1314
01:40:57,750 --> 01:41:01,481
My father is Jewish.
My mother is Jewish. I'm Jewish.

1315
01:41:03,056 --> 01:41:04,683
Maybe they made him say this

1316
01:41:04,791 --> 01:41:09,751
but I know he was undefeated
because of the next thing that he says.

1317
01:41:09,862 --> 01:41:12,831
Something the kidnappers
could not have known.

1318
01:41:14,467 --> 01:41:16,128
In the town of Benei Beraq in Israel

1319
01:41:16,235 --> 01:41:18,533
there's a street
called Chaim Pearl Street

1320
01:41:18,638 --> 01:41:20,572
which is named
after my great-grandfather

1321
01:41:20,673 --> 01:41:23,437
who was
one of the founders of the town.

1322
01:41:25,278 --> 01:41:28,042
I force myself to imagine all of it

1323
01:41:28,181 --> 01:41:31,673
and when it is over I know
there is nothing that can happen

1324
01:41:31,784 --> 01:41:34,378
that I won't have the courage to face.

1325
01:42:26,439 --> 01:42:28,373
This film is for Adam.
