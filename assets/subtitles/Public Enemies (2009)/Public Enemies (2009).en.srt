1
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:22,230
Crime rate soaring to an all-time high.

2
00:00:22,398 --> 00:00:25,608
Virtual gridlock on capital...
tax and spend, big government...

3
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:29,862
Fear mongering, deregulation...
filing for bankruptcy protection...

4
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,823
Stock market takes a beating...

5
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,783
Announced a new round of layoffs...

6
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:36,202
Unprecedented deficit
is crippling the economy.

7
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,912
We all need to tighten our belts.

8
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,914
Riots breaking out in major cities.

9
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:42,542
Our civil liberties are being trampled.

10
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:46,087
Housing market continues its decline.

11
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:47,505
Rabid inflation...

12
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:49,799
Affecting global markets.

13
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:53,136
Severe economic downturn
may be, quote, "irreversible. "

14
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,305
declare a state of emergency.
mobilizing armed troops.

15
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:59,809
today imposed martial law.
Death toll now stands at 87.

16
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:01,269
Lex Luthor's attempt...

17
00:01:01,437 --> 00:01:03,604
...to win the presidency
the old-fashioned way...

18
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,732
...by buying it,
seems to be picking up steam.

19
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,235
New polls show
that 22 percent of Americans...

20
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,988
...now support his third-party bid.

21
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:13,990
In a completely unrelated story...

22
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:16,826
...twenty-two percent
of Americans indicate a preference...

23
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:19,370
...for getting ****** in the ***
with a red-hot poker.

24
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,458
Tough times require a tough man.

25
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,293
And the tougher times get...

26
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:30,006
...the more the voters will realize
they need me in the Oval Office.

27
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:39,849
And not the least
of the problems we face...

28
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:43,644
...is that of aliens
and so-called superheroes...

29
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:48,816
...who act on their own as judge,
jury, and often, executioner.

30
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:50,943
No one is above the law.

31
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,863
I learned that for myself many years ago.

32
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,407
And now
this principle will be the driving force...

33
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:58,075
...of my presidency.

34
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,705
I have already taken steps
to bring some of these superhumans...

35
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:04,749
...into the service of our government...

36
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:07,126
...where their unique powers
will be utilized...

37
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,462
...for the benefit of all Americans.

38
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,381
They are Captain Atom...

39
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,175
...Black Lightning...

40
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:15,885
...Power Girl...

41
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:18,262
...Katana, and Major Force.

42
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,018
I hope
that in the months to come...

43
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:27,522
...many more will voluntarily
make the choice they've made.

44
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,107
And if they don't, they will find...

45
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:34,904
...that they are not as far
above the law as they think.

46
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:57,046
This started
with a routine traffic stop an hour ago.

47
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:59,215
The driver brandished a gun
at police, and...

48
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:01,759
Whoa! That was close.

49
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:04,220
This man's car
has close to 600 horsepower...

50
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:06,472
...and can go
almost 200 miles an hour.

51
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,016
That's faster than any police car.

52
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:13,020
And even the helicopters
are having a hard time keeping up w...

53
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:14,897
Wait a minute.

54
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:45,136
So this is what you've been up to
these last few months.

55
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,595
Chasing cars.

56
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,306
I help wherever I'm needed.

57
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,767
But you haven't been
needed much lately, have you?

58
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:56,480
- What do you want?
- We want you to admit something.

59
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:59,066
I'll shoot myself, I swear!

60
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:00,443
Just a minute.

61
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:04,238
I'm gonna... Ah!

62
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:10,244
- Come on, you.
- Out of the car.

63
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,123
Now, what am I supposed to admit?

64
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:17,460
That Luthor hasn't done a bad job.

65
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:25,051
Told you this would be a waste of time.

66
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,138
Luthor did the one thing
nobody was expecting.

67
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:30,723
He made things boring again.

68
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,516
And boring is good, isn't it?

69
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:35,144
The economy is back to normal.
Crime is down.

70
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,813
There are no wars or anything.

71
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,484
He's up to something.
Can't anybody see that?

72
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,152
That's what I thought at first.

73
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,446
Eventually, I realized
all he's trying to do...

74
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:49,241
...is put that formidable intellect
to work doing such a good job...

75
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,952
...no one will have a choice
but to respect him.

76
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,996
It's all about ego now.

77
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:56,707
I'll never respect him. He's a sick man.

78
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,001
He's not the first to sit in the Oval Office.

79
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:02,129
He's right. There have been womanizers,
drunks, crooks...

80
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:05,966
...but Nixon helped turn our worst enemy
into our best trading partner.

81
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,302
And Johnson gave us
the Voting Rights Act.

82
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,138
Thanks for the history lesson,
but I'm not buying it.

83
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:13,849
Come on, work with us. Please?

84
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,935
We need you.

85
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,687
Sorry.

86
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:28,030
I guess Luthor's not the only one
with an ego.

87
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:37,623
Is the spectrographic analysis
complete yet?

88
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,669
Yes, sir. And the new data
confirms our original analysis.

89
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,712
The meteor is pure kryptonite.

90
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,549
A chunk of Krypton
the size of a small country.

91
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:50,052
That planet's been an endless source
of grief for me.

92
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,721
The new numbers also indicate
our original estimate...

93
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,974
...of time of impact was right.

94
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,226
Seven days.

95
00:07:57,394 --> 00:08:01,605
Correction. There's not going to be
any impact.

96
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:03,691
What's the plan?

97
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:04,900
Missiles.

98
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,945
We've never shot down
anything that big before.

99
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:09,405
The missiles will work.

100
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:13,909
When I first heard about this,
I started doing the calculations myself.

101
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,661
You're brooding, Amanda.

102
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:19,582
I'm just thinking
we have all sorts of other firepower.

103
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,209
You mean those so-called superheroes?

104
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:25,421
They do work for you now.
Most of them, anyway.

105
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:27,965
That's to keep them
from working against me.

106
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:31,177
I'm not going to put the fate
of this planet in the hands of...

107
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,304
Of freaks and monsters.

108
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,140
- That's not why you won't use them.
No?

109
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,601
You want all the credit for yourself.

110
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:39,935
Careful.

111
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,104
Try thinking of it this way:

112
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:46,066
If you don't reach out
to some of those freaks and monsters...

113
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:50,446
...there might not be a planet left
to feed that massive ego of yours.

114
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:54,200
Now, if you have nothing else for me...

115
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,666
Ms. Waller.

116
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,502
Thank you for your honesty.

117
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:14,553
And I want to assure all Americans
and all the citizens of the world...

118
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,514
...that I intend to handle this meteor
with the efficiency...

119
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:20,100
...that characterized
my previous endeavors.

120
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:24,939
But, as a precaution,
I'd like to meet with Superman...

121
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,440
...as soon as possible.

122
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:30,319
It's time to bury our rivalry
once and for all...

123
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:33,656
...and work together
for the good of mankind.

124
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,658
This is one time he's not lying.

125
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,534
About burying the rivalry?

126
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,829
- I don't think so.
No. About the meteor.

127
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,999
I've been following it the last few days
with my own instruments.

128
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:47,086
I could go up there in a lead suit
and smash the thing.

129
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:50,339
There's no amount of lead
that could keep out so much radiation.

130
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:53,008
And it wouldn't stand up
to all that smashing either.

131
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:54,343
Got anything better?

132
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,805
I'm working on something
with one of my contacts.

133
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:04,019
You're going to go
and meet with him, aren't you?

134
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:05,396
You know me too well.

135
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,898
I can't just stand back and do nothing.

136
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:11,485
Well, when it all goes south,
don't count on me to save you.

137
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,195
I won't.

138
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,781
I know you pretty well too.

139
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:48,272
Well?

140
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,692
Somehow, I knew that would be
the first word out of your mouth.

141
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:56,822
When the meteor gets close enough,
I'm sending up a dozen missiles.

142
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,575
Each one is going to have
a 50-megaton warhead.

143
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:00,909
What do you want from me?

144
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:05,581
Some of my people don't have
as much confidence in this plan as I do.

145
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:07,249
They think I need a backup.

146
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:10,044
With the whole world at stake,
that's not a bad idea.

147
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,546
Does that mean
you're willing to work for me?

148
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:16,925
- For you?
- Yes. You'll be working for me.

149
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,596
But only insofar as I represent
the country that adopted you.

150
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:22,973
And that you love.

151
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:26,935
What's wrong?
Was I getting too sentimental?

152
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:30,314
Luthor.

153
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,274
You think I'd be crazy enough...

154
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:36,153
...to meet you
without some kind of protection?

155
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,743
- Metallo.
- Who else could stand up to you?

156
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:55,255
Shouldn't have done that.
He's the president.

157
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:27,115
- That's not gonna hold him for long.
- I know.

158
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,493
That's why you have to get out of here.

159
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:55,936
Superman.

160
00:14:57,522 --> 00:15:00,148
From me to you.

161
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:25,215
What was that explosion? Plastique?

162
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:28,635
- Something like that.
- It won't stop him.

163
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:32,389
- He's going to reconfigure.
- Don't worry about that now.

164
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,520
The kryptonite is near your heart.

165
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:41,189
I don't know if I'll get it
before the wound closes.

166
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,233
Where's The Flash when you need him?

167
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,402
Do me a favor
and lose the sense of humor.

168
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,904
Do us both a favor and buy one.

169
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:09,217
We can't go back up.
He might still be there.

170
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,428
Neither of us is in any shape
to take him on.

171
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,597
Then what are we supposed to do?

172
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:16,058
The cemetery was built
over the old sewer system.

173
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,310
But how can we...?

174
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:24,274
- Are you up to it?
- We'll find out, won't we?

175
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,252
Oh, it's you.

176
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,730
Bruce.

177
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,112
It's not ending here.

178
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,738
I won't let it.

179
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,120
I thought...

180
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,248
...I was supposed to rescue you.

181
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,333
There might still be time for that.

182
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,963
Can we get to your cave from here?

183
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:30,215
Eventually.

184
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:35,345
Time for you to see my side of the world.

185
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:44,312
Some company you keep.

186
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:52,946
Come on, Bruce. Stay with me.

187
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,116
You know who I was thinking
about the other day?

188
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:57,993
Who?
- Magpie.

189
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:00,495
The criminal?
- Do we know another Magpie?

190
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:01,872
Whatever happened to her?

191
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:05,000
- She died.
- No. Are you sure?

192
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:06,334
Reasonably.

193
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,004
Why is it that good villains never die?

194
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:12,299
Clark, what the hell are good villains?

195
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:20,390
- Can you do it?
- Sure.

196
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:23,018
Bend steel and all that.

197
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:41,453
Clark.

198
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:43,914
It tickles.

199
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,248
Halt.

200
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,542
Identify yourselves.

201
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:51,880
Alfred, it's me.
- Master Bruce.

202
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,893
You can rest easy, sir.

203
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,770
I'm already feeling better. Thanks.

204
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:10,732
I took the liberty of washing
and repairing your shirt and cape.

205
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:15,695
The souvenirs of the Gotham City sewers
are best left under the streets.

206
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,657
I'm sure Lois will appreciate that.

207
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:24,579
- Honor and distinction.

208
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:28,208
John Corben might have been
more machine than man...

209
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:30,418
...but he was still human.

210
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:34,589
A human being
who certainly didn't deserve this.

211
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:39,803
He came to me months ago,
seeking a pardon and a fresh start...

212
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:41,930
...and, mindful of my own history...

213
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,933
...as well as his enormous potential
for good...

214
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:46,726
...I granted him both.

215
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:51,106
In the short time Mr. Corben had left,
he worked hard for this country...

216
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:55,110
...helping to keep her secure
from terrorist threats.

217
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:58,905
Then, last night,
John Corben was murdered.

218
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:01,074
Murdered, our prosecutors believe...

219
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:03,952
...by a man
who used his own freakish power...

220
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:09,416
...to settle a personal score
in violation of the laws that bind us all.

221
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:13,753
A man who calls himself Superman.

222
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,131
Does he think
anybody's gonna believe that?

223
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:18,300
I met with Superman
to try to enlist him...

224
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,719
...in the government's effort
to stop the meteor.

225
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,471
He, of all people,
should have been eager to help.

226
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,891
But instead, he lost his temper.

227
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,810
Metallo stepped in to protect me.

228
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:33,315
And this is what Superman did to him.

229
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,533
I know many of you
will find it difficult to believe...

230
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:45,660
...that Superman could do this.

231
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,704
I shared that skepticism...

232
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:50,373
...until some of our top scientists
reminded me...

233
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:53,126
...that Superman's vulnerability
to kryptonite...

234
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:56,004
...can have a psychological component.

235
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:59,341
In other words,
the radiation from the approaching meteor...

236
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,844
...is affecting Superman's mind.

237
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:04,763
He's a danger to us all now.

238
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:06,806
And himself as well.

239
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,350
In accordance with that...

240
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,393
...I am announcing a bounty on him...

241
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:14,564
...in the amount of one billion dollars.

242
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:17,233
It pains me to do this...

243
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,903
...but as our planet faces
its gravest peril...

244
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:24,866
...we cannot afford to be distracted
by one man's growing irrationality.

245
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:28,745
Thank you and good night.

246
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:32,457
And we're out.
Thank you, Mr. President.

247
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,835
Let's go, people.

248
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:48,181
Come in.

249
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:52,686
Mr. President, can I talk to you?
It's really important.

250
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,900
"Growing irrationality"?

251
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:01,236
- Who does he think...?
- Can it affect your mind?

252
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:04,072
No. I mean, it never has.

253
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,449
Look, this whole thing
is just plain ridiculous.

254
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:08,618
- I can prove I didn't kill him.
- How?

255
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:11,121
You were with me the whole time, and...

256
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:16,001
- Oh.
- I'll figure out a way to clear this up later.

257
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:19,087
Right now,
you and I have a meteor to stop.

258
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,297
He didn't do it. I'm sure of it.

259
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,632
Oh, really?

260
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,968
It's just not in him.

261
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:27,971
Do me a favor.

262
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:30,390
Think back to three years ago.

263
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:34,477
Could you have even dreamed back then
that I would be president today?

264
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:37,313
Did you think it was in me?

265
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:45,488
Then if I could change that much,
couldn't he?

266
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:03,131
You're late. What took you?

267
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,842
I honestly don't think you'd understand.

268
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,802
- Lois?
- Mm-hm.

269
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,304
You're right.

270
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,643
You know,
you didn't need to use the wire.

271
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:19,773
- I could have carried you.
- Between you and me, I hate that.

272
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:21,983
This won't take long.

273
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:30,992
- See something?
- Smell something.

274
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:42,462
Now even I can smell it.

275
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:59,896
They must think I did this
with my heat vision.

276
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:06,528
You couldn't have.
Not unless your heat vision is radioactive.

277
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,863
It's not, is it?

278
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:14,744
No. This way.

279
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:22,377
- Now I really do look like a criminal.
- It's done wonders for me.

280
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:24,504
But how do we get the data now?

281
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:26,047
There's one other possibility.

282
00:24:57,955 --> 00:25:00,165
Okay, where's your friend?

283
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:05,086
Yeah. The one
who's worth a billion bucks.

284
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:09,257
You wanna play it that way? Okay.

285
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:25,815
Superman.
- Little busy at the moment.

286
00:25:27,902 --> 00:25:29,944
When you can, bring the heat.

287
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,581
Now!

288
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:49,380
- You all right?
- Better than them, anyway.

289
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,799
Banshee's out.
Can you keep her that way?

290
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:55,386
Hypersonics.
Effective even on metahumans.

291
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:56,763
If she tries anything...

292
00:25:56,931 --> 00:25:59,390
...this will drive her scream
right back at her.

293
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:03,353
- More?
- Everyone wants that reward.

294
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:23,289
All you are is a rat with wings.

295
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:28,670
And what better way to get rid of a rat
than by drowning it?

296
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:48,064
There. That wasn't too difficult.
I'll have to ask the Joker...

297
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:52,443
...why he's had so much trouble
doing this over the years.

298
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:55,571
So this isn't a complete waste
of my energies...

299
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:59,492
...let's have a peek under that cowl.

300
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:05,873
What do you need with money, Mongul?

301
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,876
All you've ever cared about
is ruling the universe.

302
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,048
Grundy not feel good.

303
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:16,426
Grundy gonna feel a lot worse.

304
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,228
Shiva.

305
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:31,149
You wanna be Luthor's boy now?

306
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:33,026
I'm sick...

307
00:27:34,445 --> 00:27:36,070
...of Lex Luthor.

308
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,963
Mongul wasn't his usual
talkative self.

309
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:56,591
And Grundy
sounded like William F. Buckley.

310
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:59,302
You think
there's some kind of mind control going on?

311
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,971
A telepath, or maybe a...?

312
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:05,850
- Nightshade.
Interesting.

313
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:07,852
Even the lesser ones have some value...

314
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,355
...when their powers
are put to the proper use.

315
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,023
I know that speech pattern.

316
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:20,782
Top of that building.

317
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:27,121
Grodd. Of course.

318
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:32,126
Had to be a telepath.
Heard a gorilla's heartbeat.

319
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:42,053
Pull.

320
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:49,811
Hey. What...?

321
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:01,656
We're surrounded.
I can hear them coming.

322
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:25,638
I suppose it's useless to tell you to leave.

323
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:27,515
I wouldn't miss this for anything.

324
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:29,851
- Your funeral.
- Already had one.

325
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:44,258
- I never believed in the cavalry.
- Captain Atom, I wanna thank you...

326
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:48,137
I have a federal warrant
for your arrest, Superman.

327
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:52,141
So much for the cavalry.

328
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,945
Are you all right, Mr. President?

329
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:07,156
Fine. But thank you for asking.

330
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:25,967
At ease, at ease.

331
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:29,637
Let's see those missiles, general.

332
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,139
You sold out to Luthor.

333
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,683
I'm doing my duty.

334
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,602
Look, this isn't my decision to make.
It's the court's.

335
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:39,480
"Court's"? This is Luthor's vendetta.

336
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:42,650
Power Girl,
what do you think about all this?

337
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:46,070
It doesn't matter what any of us thinks.
Luthor is the president...

338
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:47,822
...and what he says goes.

339
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:50,283
Now, are you coming or not?

340
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:52,326
Not.

341
00:31:57,207 --> 00:31:58,499
You piece of...

342
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:40,750
Look out!

343
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,782
Enough.

344
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:03,791
Some of our scientists were
going over the scenario in their computers.

345
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:06,252
They don't think the missiles
will be enough to...

346
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,004
General, I don't care
what your scientists think.

347
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:11,173
The missiles will knock out that meteor.

348
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:14,552
- I did all the calculations myself.
- Yes, sir.

349
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:18,848
Captain Atom. This isn't the best time.

350
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:21,600
I'm sorry, sir,
but you wanted to be kept apprised.

351
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:24,478
Yes. Fine. Do you have them in custody?

352
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:26,480
- No, sir.
- What happened?

353
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:28,399
- We lost Power Girl.
- She's dead?

354
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,484
- We're not sure. She...
- Captain Atom...

355
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:32,945
...I have three words for you:

356
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:36,824
Finish your job.

357
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,535
Superheroes.

358
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,164
It's not gonna be any easier
without Power Girl.

359
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,124
We should have killed them.

360
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:48,002
We do not kill people. Understand?

361
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:50,045
Is that right?

362
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:02,308
- You all right?
- Uh-huh.

363
00:35:02,476 --> 00:35:05,352
- What made you do that?
- Warn you?

364
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,521
It just sort of came out.

365
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:12,318
- You don't think I killed Metallo, do you?
- Don't know. Luthor says you did.

366
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:15,362
Tell me something, Power Girl.

367
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,199
Now that you've been up close
and personal with Luthor...

368
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,993
...how do you feel about him?
- He's the president.

369
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:23,204
But how do you feel
when you're around him?

370
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,997
He...

371
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:26,832
He makes my skin crawl.

372
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,335
Sometimes you have
to trust your instincts.

373
00:35:29,503 --> 00:35:30,836
But how do you know when?

374
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:33,464
Now.

375
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:43,015
- See? She's a traitor.
- Is that true?

376
00:35:43,183 --> 00:35:45,893
- It's complicated.
- No, it isn't.

377
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,964
- Tell me something.
- What do you want, dirtbag?

378
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:59,592
Did Metallo say anything
before he died?

379
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:02,136
Was he surprised to see you?

380
00:37:02,304 --> 00:37:04,305
I don't know what you're talking about.

381
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,599
What did Luthor promise you?

382
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:08,809
- Money?
What do I need with money?

383
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:10,686
I'm living energy.

384
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:14,732
You're not going to tell me you killed him
for your country, are you?

385
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:19,528
Some of us still believe
in putting our country first.

386
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:22,531
Sorry, but I don't see any patriotism here.

387
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:26,368
All I see is a psycho who's latched
onto an excuse to kill people...

388
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:31,665
...and who's so stupid he doesn't realize
he's being used by Luthor.

389
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,887
Power Girl, don't!

390
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:53,520
Do you know what you've done?

391
00:37:55,649 --> 00:37:57,816
Can either of you contain that radiation?

392
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:01,153
- I might be able to put up a force field.
- Go.

393
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:13,165
- He's not gonna be able to keep that up.
I can absorb it.

394
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:18,545
- Captain, I can't let you...
- I was watching. And listening.

395
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,255
This is the least I can do.

396
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:28,555
Let's do this.

397
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:45,257
Five, four, three, two, one.

398
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:47,384
Liftoff.

399
00:39:58,313 --> 00:39:59,980
And they're on their way.

400
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,029
Wormhole generator engaged.

401
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,005
Closing on target.

402
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:43,023
Don't worry.
I'm not going to say "I told you so. "

403
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:44,942
Good thing.

404
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:50,322
General, what the hell happened?

405
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:51,824
You...

406
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:54,868
We didn't take into account
all that radiation.

407
00:40:55,328 --> 00:40:57,788
It detonated the warheads
before they hit.

408
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,623
So the meteor is...

409
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,959
Still on course.

410
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,916
Well, this is it.

411
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,753
Luthor's got his own office in there.

412
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,256
This has to be where he's keeping
the information.

413
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:51,717
And by now,
they must have the numbers we need...

414
00:41:51,885 --> 00:41:53,552
...on the meteor's radiation level.

415
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,387
- So how do we get in?
- Don't worry.

416
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:56,889
We've got it worked out.

417
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,224
But you need to be somewhere else
right now.

418
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:00,767
- Yeah, but...
- Go.

419
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:12,112
They're bound to have all kinds of radar.
We should go the rest of the way on foot.

420
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,951
We do have something worked out,
don't we?

421
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:21,288
No. But I'm sure it'll come to me.

422
00:42:36,638 --> 00:42:40,933
It doesn't take the wisdom of Solomon
to know you should stay down.

423
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,393
Tell me something, Captain Marvel.

424
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:46,772
Would Solomon have gone to work
for Lex Luthor?

425
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:52,527
Batman, don't make this any more difficult
than it has to be.

426
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:09,544
You wanna play it that way? Fine.

427
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:28,897
You know,
you've never been any good against magic.

428
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:33,902
And magic's what I'm all about.

429
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:50,419
- Superman. Castling.
- Good call.

430
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:14,735
Captain Marvel?

431
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,533
Hawkman, before you black out...

432
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:24,453
...I want you to know
I wish it didn't have to be like this.

433
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,121
Before I black out?

434
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:38,216
Are you all right?

435
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:40,927
Say something.

436
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:44,014
Shazam.

437
00:44:57,111 --> 00:45:01,323
This initial attempt was planned
from the start only as a research mission.

438
00:45:01,491 --> 00:45:03,867
Now that I have the data I need
about the meteor...

439
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:07,537
...I'll be able to put the second phase
of my plan into operation.

440
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:10,707
I want to assure you that I will deal
with this promptly and effectively.

441
00:45:12,377 --> 00:45:15,879
You have nothing to fear,
so, please, continue your work...

442
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:18,673
...your play, your travel, your shopping...

443
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:20,801
...and everything else you normally do.

444
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:24,137
Thank you, and may God...

445
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:32,312
I'm sorry, no one's allowed...

446
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,148
Mr. President,
the whole country's in a state of panic...

447
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:38,610
...and they're ready to take you out
behind a barn and...

448
00:45:43,533 --> 00:45:45,283
What are you...?

449
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:48,161
Just taking my supplements, that's all.

450
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:49,704
Supplements?

451
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:54,501
A little steroidal cocktail for strength,
and some liquid kryptonite for...

452
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,503
Well, just in case.

453
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:58,004
How long...?

454
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:00,132
Since the last week of the campaign.

455
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:04,386
It's given me boundless energy
and a clarity I never had before.

456
00:46:04,554 --> 00:46:07,556
- What about the meteor?
- The meteor's going to hit.

457
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:10,684
It doesn't have to. There are other ways.

458
00:46:10,852 --> 00:46:13,395
- That boy in Japan.
- I know all about him.

459
00:46:13,563 --> 00:46:14,980
- I won't be needing him.
- But...

460
00:46:15,148 --> 00:46:19,025
Don't worry, Amanda,
everything's going to be fine.

461
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:22,487
- "Fine"?
- I've come to realize that this meteor...

462
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:24,364
...is a gift from the heavens.

463
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:28,076
It's going to scourge the earth of millions,
maybe billions of people...

464
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:30,036
...the planet couldn't sustain anyway.

465
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:33,123
The world that will spring
from the ashes will be a better one.

466
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:34,666
Rational, orderly.

467
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:36,585
And you know how I know that?

468
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:39,629
Because I'm going to build that world.

469
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:44,718
And, of course,
I intend for you to play a role in all this.

470
00:46:44,886 --> 00:46:48,555
A very important role.

471
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:53,768
Mr. President,
Hawkman and Captain Marvel are here.

472
00:46:54,604 --> 00:46:57,022
We'll talk more later.

473
00:47:01,277 --> 00:47:04,237
Captain Marvel. Hawkman.
This is a surprise.

474
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:06,865
You wouldn't know
what happened to those fugitives...

475
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:08,575
...you were supposed to bring in?

476
00:47:09,202 --> 00:47:10,744
They're right in front of you.

477
00:47:15,917 --> 00:47:17,667
- How...?
- We had some help.

478
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,920
Give us all the data
you've got on the meteor.

479
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:22,422
- Hurry.
- Of course, of course.

480
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:31,932
What's wrong?

481
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,059
Feeling a little green at the gills?

482
00:47:35,228 --> 00:47:37,896
Well, well,
a bat by any other name...

483
00:47:38,064 --> 00:47:39,898
He said hurry, Luthor.

484
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:48,156
All right, all right. I'll tell you where it is.

485
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:54,663
- Computer.
Yes, Mr. President?

486
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,289
Delete all files immediately.

487
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:59,000
Deleting. Deleting. Deleting.
- No!

488
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:01,795
All files deleted.

489
00:48:01,963 --> 00:48:06,841
Aw. You two aren't going to be able
to save the world now.

490
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,802
Well, I'll tell you something.

491
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:11,221
Everyone who lives see the new world...

492
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:14,015
...will have learned
never to trust your kind again.

493
00:48:14,183 --> 00:48:15,350
Shut up.

494
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,943
Here. It's got all the information
you need on it.

495
00:48:26,195 --> 00:48:27,946
Now go save us.

496
00:48:45,006 --> 00:48:46,381
Bitch.

497
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:49,009
General, arrest him.

498
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:09,696
It's like the old saying.

499
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:14,534
If you want someone killed right,
you have to kill them yourself.

500
00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:29,174
Mr. President, are you all right?

501
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:31,718
Mr. President.

502
00:49:38,768 --> 00:49:42,270
I'm perfectly fine, as anyone can see.

503
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:38,201
- Where does a kid get this kind of money?
I had this kind of money.

504
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:40,245
Wasn't interested in toys, though.

505
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:48,628
Hey, guys. How did it go?

506
00:50:48,796 --> 00:50:50,171
Got everything we needed.

507
00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:53,049
Thanks again for your help
with Hawkman and Captain Marvel.

508
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:55,552
Wait a minute.
Why aren't you with the boy?

509
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,178
I'm close enough right here.

510
00:50:57,346 --> 00:50:59,639
And he's not really that much of a boy,
you know?

511
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:01,725
He's 13.

512
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,150
He's down that way.
I'll just stay back here.

513
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:26,833
Supes, Bats. Que pasta?

514
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:30,003
- Is it ready, Hiro?
- Toyman to you.

515
00:51:30,171 --> 00:51:32,714
I got a copyright to protect.
And, yeah, it's ready.

516
00:51:32,882 --> 00:51:35,842
- All I need is some numerals.
- Everything you need is in here.

517
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,343
Excellent.

518
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:42,015
I'll input them,
and then it's blastoff time.

519
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:46,352
Hey, did you guys see Power Girl
when you came in?

520
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:50,648
If you see her again,
tell her I'm sorry about the X-ray goggles.

521
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,943
I was just testing them, that's all.

522
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:56,863
Now I gotta rebuild them from scratch.

523
00:51:57,031 --> 00:52:00,867
Hiro... Uh, Toyman,
can we please see the rocket now?

524
00:52:01,035 --> 00:52:02,744
Sure, sure.

525
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:05,413
I didn't have a lot of time...

526
00:52:05,581 --> 00:52:08,416
...so I based it on a design
I whipped up when I was 7.

527
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:13,922
That's why it has manual controls
even though it's not going to need a pilot.

528
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:18,760
Oh, one other thing.

529
00:52:18,928 --> 00:52:22,430
Back when I designed it,
I was way into hero worship.

530
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,563
You are absolutely sure
this is going to work?

531
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:33,691
Does Power Girl have big...?
- Just feed it the numbers, kid.

532
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:35,527
You got it.

533
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:41,658
Wow.

534
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:54,212
Who's there?

535
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:06,099
Isn't there any way
to speed this up, Toyman?

536
00:53:06,267 --> 00:53:08,935
Sure, go find
some other kid with a 210 IQ.

537
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:10,937
And good luck with that.

538
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:22,282
Hello, sunshine.

539
00:53:40,426 --> 00:53:42,135
Keep going.

540
00:54:04,992 --> 00:54:07,118
I can't think of a morning...

541
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:12,624
...I haven't woken up
with the thought of strangling you.

542
00:54:15,544 --> 00:54:19,547
That sanctimonious image
of yours fooled everyone...

543
00:54:19,715 --> 00:54:21,007
...except me...

544
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:29,265
...because I know evil.

545
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:44,197
It had to be you...

546
00:54:44,365 --> 00:54:47,700
...the one other person in the world
smart enough to stop that meteor.

547
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:51,371
The only person smart enough.
You couldn't do it, remember?

548
00:54:55,793 --> 00:54:58,419
What are you doing?
How am I gonna guide my rocket?

549
00:54:58,587 --> 00:55:00,129
You're not going to.

550
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,882
It's never going to take off.

551
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:23,987
Wait.

552
00:55:25,948 --> 00:55:27,198
What are you doing?

553
00:55:27,366 --> 00:55:29,409
I'm going to fly this thing myself.

554
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:31,577
Are you crazy?

555
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:38,084
Goodbye.

556
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:06,404
You come to this planet...

557
00:56:06,572 --> 00:56:09,615
...declare yourself the savior of mankind.

558
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:12,952
Well, I think it's time you died
for your sins.

559
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,673
That was my best friend.

560
00:57:09,802 --> 00:57:11,469
And you just killed him.

561
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:49,775
When does it end, Luthor?

562
00:58:55,574 --> 00:58:58,784
I'll answer for you. It ends tonight.

563
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:31,877
You can't touch me.
We're on American soil now.

564
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:35,548
And I am the president.

565
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:38,759
Consider yourself...

566
01:00:41,722 --> 01:00:44,390
...impeached.
- Yeah!

567
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:52,398
Superman.

568
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:54,567
Looks like I recovered a little too late.

569
01:00:54,735 --> 01:00:57,111
Forget about that.
I got a message from Toyman.

570
01:00:57,571 --> 01:01:00,197
He says that there's still a chance.

571
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:16,714
What are you doing? Stay back. Stop.

572
01:01:16,882 --> 01:01:20,801
That's an order from the president!

573
01:02:43,051 --> 01:02:46,554
The voice of the people
must be heard. I am the president!

574
01:02:47,556 --> 01:02:49,098
God bless America.

575
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:51,725
God bless me.

576
01:02:56,398 --> 01:03:00,025
I have the feeling I'm not gonna have
to worry about that murder charge.

577
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:02,653
Would have been
an interesting trial, though.

578
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:18,586
Wanna stick around for a while?
Lois and I would...

579
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:20,504
I can't. It's late.

580
01:03:20,964 --> 01:03:22,381
"Late"?

581
01:03:26,887 --> 01:03:28,888
Come on, it's...

582
01:03:29,556 --> 01:03:31,390
...early.
