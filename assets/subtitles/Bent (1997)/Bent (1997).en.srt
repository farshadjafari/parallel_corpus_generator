1
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,368
Max.

2
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,872
Unfortunate he's just so cute.

3
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:33,543
Here.

4
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:09,610
Hello, stranger.

5
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:15,352
-There you are.
-Thanks.

6
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,164
lt's nice.

7
00:03:40,586 --> 00:03:42,646
-Who's that?
-lt's Max.

8
00:03:46,992 --> 00:03:49,086
How are we doing, then, girls?

9
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:53,631
Give me that.

10
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,168
Let her die.

11
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:59,069
Revenge!

12
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,037
-He's your man.
-That's my boy.

13
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:24,718
Streets of Berlin

14
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,290
I must leave you soon

15
00:04:31,303 --> 00:04:33,966
Oh, will you

16
00:04:34,906 --> 00:04:36,737
forget me?

17
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,273
Was I ever really here?

18
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,619
Find me a bar

19
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:54,250
on the cobble-stoned streets

20
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,755
where the boys are pretty

21
00:05:02,134 --> 00:05:04,329
I cannot love

22
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:07,673
for more than one day

23
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,807
But one day is enough

24
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,745
in this city

25
00:05:15,981 --> 00:05:17,711
Find me a boy

26
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:21,115
with two ocean-blue eyes

27
00:05:22,521 --> 00:05:24,956
And show no pity

28
00:05:29,194 --> 00:05:31,629
Take out his eyes

29
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:34,461
He never need see

30
00:05:35,867 --> 00:05:39,167
how they eat you alive

31
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:41,738
in this city

32
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:53,615
Streets of Berlin

33
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,180
will you miss me?

34
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,524
Streets of Berlin

35
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:05,824
do you care?

36
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,733
Streets of Berlin

37
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:14,268
will you cry out

38
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:18,637
if I vanish

39
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:23,141
into thin air?

40
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,086
What's the problem?

41
00:07:08,226 --> 00:07:09,194
Watch it!

42
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:20,800
You, too.

43
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:24,036
Come on.

44
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:07,612
l'm a rotten person.

45
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,689
Why am l so rotten?
Why do l do these things?

46
00:08:16,461 --> 00:08:18,793
He's gorgeous, though, isn't he?

47
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:23,158
l don't remember anything.
Did we have a threesome?

48
00:08:23,401 --> 00:08:26,132
Maybe the two of you had a threesome.

49
00:11:26,985 --> 00:11:27,975
Hello.

50
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,279
Morning.

51
00:11:31,456 --> 00:11:32,582
l look silly.

52
00:11:43,134 --> 00:11:44,328
Not now.

53
00:11:56,948 --> 00:11:58,438
This place....

54
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:01,644
Yes?

55
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:04,455
lt's really....

56
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,437
The country will be nice.

57
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:23,537
-What's the country?
-The house.

58
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,644
Your country house.

59
00:12:43,261 --> 00:12:46,129
How do we get to the country?

60
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:48,058
-A car.
-Mine?

61
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:51,902
-Shit!
-Rosen.

62
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,436
Our landlord. We owe a lot of rent.

63
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:57,568
Rent? l thought you were rich.

64
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:58,700
Rich?

65
00:12:58,977 --> 00:13:00,673
You told me you were rich.

66
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:02,677
l was joking. Listen....

67
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:05,716
You don't happen
to have any extra cash, do you?

68
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:08,953
Don't make jokes. l don't like jokes.

69
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:11,847
You don't want me with you. ls that it?

70
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:15,658
Maybe l'm not good enough for you.
Not rich enough.

71
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:19,596
My father made watches.
That's not so wonderful.

72
00:13:19,831 --> 00:13:21,423
ls it, ''Baron''?

73
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,668
Baron?

74
00:13:33,144 --> 00:13:34,168
Him.

75
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:35,434
No!

76
00:13:47,692 --> 00:13:48,784
Fuck!

77
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:50,389
Hold him.

78
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:39,970
Greta!

79
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:41,573
Gracious!

80
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:44,080
Still alive?

81
00:14:44,616 --> 00:14:46,106
l'm impressed.

82
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,985
Love your street-wear.

83
00:14:54,826 --> 00:14:56,020
Over, now.

84
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:02,924
Ciao.

85
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:32,457
ls it safe?

86
00:15:32,563 --> 00:15:33,587
What?

87
00:15:33,798 --> 00:15:35,426
For us to go home.

88
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,558
You fucking queers.
Don't you have any brains at all?

89
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:42,697
-lt's not safe.
-Who was he?

90
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:45,202
-Who was who?
-The blonde boy.

91
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:48,042
Wolfgang Granz.

92
00:15:49,414 --> 00:15:51,508
Guess who his boyfriend was?

93
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,683
You're not guessing.

94
00:15:54,452 --> 00:15:56,044
Karl Ernst.

95
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,879
Who's Karl Ernst?

96
00:15:58,256 --> 00:16:00,282
What kind of world do you live in?

97
00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:03,024
Aren't you girls ever curious
about what's going on?

98
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:05,755
Don't lecture. Who's Karl Ernst?

99
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,525
George, actually.

100
00:16:08,866 --> 00:16:09,924
What?

101
00:16:11,736 --> 00:16:13,226
l'm George, now.

102
00:16:30,855 --> 00:16:33,415
Karl Ernst was von Helldorf's deputy.

103
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:40,461
l suppose you have no idea
who von Helldorf is.

104
00:16:41,866 --> 00:16:45,735
Second-in-command of the Storm Troopers,
immediately under Ernst Rohm.

105
00:16:46,871 --> 00:16:49,033
Ernst Rohm, l know him.

106
00:16:49,707 --> 00:16:51,231
He's that fat queen.

107
00:16:51,576 --> 00:16:52,702
Friend of Hitler's.

108
00:16:52,977 --> 00:16:55,879
Runs around with many beautiful boys.
Goes to all the clubs.

109
00:16:56,014 --> 00:16:57,481
Rudy, shut up.

110
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,850
-Why?
-Just shut up.

111
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,152
Mein FÃ¼hrer had Rohm murdered last night.

112
00:17:05,857 --> 00:17:07,758
And all of his friends.

113
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,551
And their friends.

114
00:17:09,694 --> 00:17:11,287
And their tricks.

115
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,188
And whoever happened by.

116
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:14,955
So queer is out.

117
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:16,327
Queer is dead.

118
00:17:18,269 --> 00:17:19,896
You just pulled the wrong guy.

119
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:23,167
We can explain it to someone.
lt's not as if we knew him.

120
00:17:23,674 --> 00:17:24,971
Hello, darling.

121
00:17:25,076 --> 00:17:27,135
-So how about you?
-Me?

122
00:17:28,413 --> 00:17:30,507
Everyone knows l'm not queer.

123
00:17:30,982 --> 00:17:32,951
l've got a wife and kids.

124
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:35,643
l've had every whore on this street.

125
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:38,486
l'm just an average kind of guy.

126
00:17:43,494 --> 00:17:45,394
-Bye-bye now.
-Where are you going?

127
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:46,691
Prayer.

128
00:17:47,965 --> 00:17:49,990
-How much?
-How much, what?

129
00:17:50,134 --> 00:17:51,829
How much did they give you?

130
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:54,163
What a desperate thing to say.

131
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,875
Here, take this.

132
00:17:58,042 --> 00:17:59,806
-We don't want it.
-Shut up, Rudy.

133
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,073
-Stop telling me to shut--
-Shut up.

134
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,441
lt's not enough.

135
00:18:03,548 --> 00:18:05,778
lf they catch us, l'll name names.

136
00:18:06,451 --> 00:18:09,421
A threat. l'm utterly terrified.

137
00:18:09,821 --> 00:18:10,981
Here....

138
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:12,886
l'm a true Christian.

139
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:18,051
l won't say a word to the Gestapo
until the service is over.

140
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:21,891
Ciao.

141
00:18:30,675 --> 00:18:32,507
l'm not leaving Berlin.

142
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,938
-We have to.
-We don't have to.

143
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:38,982
l've paid up for dance class
for the next two weeks. l can't leave.

144
00:18:39,417 --> 00:18:41,409
Why did you have to take him home?

145
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,413
You've ruined everything.

146
00:18:43,521 --> 00:18:46,251
Go back to your fucking dance class.

147
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:50,453
They can shoot you
in the middle of an arabesque.

148
00:18:56,801 --> 00:18:59,066
Move out of the way.

149
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,372
Where will we go?

150
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:33,534
What is it?

151
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,098
Do you love him?

152
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,343
-What?
-The dancer.

153
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,645
Christ!

154
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:48,115
l just feel responsible.

155
00:19:48,886 --> 00:19:51,947
Fluffs can't afford
that kind of responsibility.

156
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:55,726
-Why are you laughing?
-That word.

157
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,222
''Fluffs.''

158
00:20:35,032 --> 00:20:36,000
Damn!

159
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:42,599
We aren't allowed to be fluffs, anymore.

160
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:46,974
We aren't even allowed to kiss or embrace...

161
00:20:48,579 --> 00:20:49,773
or fantasize.

162
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:52,542
They can arrest you
for having fluff thoughts.

163
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:54,548
Uncle Freddie!

164
00:20:55,086 --> 00:20:56,179
lt's not funny.

165
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:58,346
l think geraniums are best.

166
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:02,724
The family takes care of me.

167
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:05,358
But you...

168
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:08,295
throwing it in everyone's face.

169
00:21:08,933 --> 00:21:12,096
No wonder they don't want
anything to do with you.

170
00:21:12,403 --> 00:21:13,871
Maximilian...

171
00:21:14,605 --> 00:21:16,938
-take the ticket.
-l need two.

172
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:20,442
But l haven't the right dress for the dance.

173
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,308
Look.

174
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,284
Over there.

175
00:21:31,856 --> 00:21:32,914
Cute.

176
00:21:33,924 --> 00:21:35,221
l suppose.

177
00:21:35,993 --> 00:21:37,393
Think he's a fluff?

178
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:39,394
Don't care.

179
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:46,237
Except the baritone.

180
00:21:53,077 --> 00:21:55,511
You've been on the run since '34...

181
00:21:55,646 --> 00:21:57,842
over a year with that dancer.

182
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:03,413
The family knows all about it.

183
00:22:04,522 --> 00:22:06,490
You can't live like that.

184
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:10,459
-Please--
-l need two tickets.

185
00:22:10,761 --> 00:22:13,195
-l can't get two.
-''l can't get two.''

186
00:22:20,404 --> 00:22:22,669
Nothing really works, does it?

187
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:26,268
Get out.

188
00:22:27,311 --> 00:22:28,869
How about a deal?

189
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:32,511
Two tickets to Amsterdam,
two new identity cards.

190
00:22:32,616 --> 00:22:36,383
Once we get to Amsterdam, l'll ditch him.
The family can have me back.

191
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:38,786
Maybe they don't want you back.

192
00:22:39,423 --> 00:22:41,153
lt's been 10 years.

193
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:42,692
They want me.

194
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:44,326
lt's good business.

195
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:45,987
l'm an only son.

196
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:50,695
Remember that marriage
that Father wanted to arrange?

197
00:22:50,801 --> 00:22:53,292
Her father had button factories, too.

198
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:56,238
She's a widow now, lives in Brussels.

199
00:22:57,342 --> 00:22:59,401
Make the arrangements again.

200
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:03,638
Our button factories
can sleep with her button factories.

201
00:23:04,115 --> 00:23:07,915
And eventually when all this blows over,
you can get me back to Germany.

202
00:23:08,753 --> 00:23:10,414
lf l want a boy...

203
00:23:10,821 --> 00:23:12,311
l'll rent him...

204
00:23:13,157 --> 00:23:14,385
like you.

205
00:23:15,626 --> 00:23:18,186
l'll be a discreet, quiet...

206
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:20,023
fluff.

207
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:24,260
Just get us both out alive.

208
00:23:26,637 --> 00:23:29,800
l can't do things on my own.

209
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:31,167
Not now.

210
00:23:32,176 --> 00:23:34,304
l'll have to ask your father.

211
00:23:37,348 --> 00:23:38,645
Walk away.

212
00:23:42,953 --> 00:23:44,285
Be careful.

213
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:10,769
You should sign on.

214
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:12,938
They don't check your papers.

215
00:25:13,077 --> 00:25:15,944
lt's good exercise, too, for the shoulders.

216
00:25:17,348 --> 00:25:19,374
l'm getting nice shoulders.

217
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:25,118
-What did you do today?
-Nothing.

218
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:27,080
l went to town.

219
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,960
-l'm working on something.
-Really?

220
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:32,595
A deal.

221
00:25:32,963 --> 00:25:34,989
A deal. Wonderful.

222
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:37,567
l might get us new papers,
and tickets to Amsterdam.

223
00:25:37,801 --> 00:25:40,463
-You said that in Hamburg.
-lt didn't work out, in Hamburg.

224
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:43,132
-You said that in Stuttgart.
-You gonna recite the list?

225
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,674
Why not? l'm tired of your deals.

226
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:49,778
You know what? This cheese stinks.

227
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:12,500
Why don't we just cross it?

228
00:26:13,837 --> 00:26:14,895
What?

229
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,071
The border.

230
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:23,172
This guy on the job today
was telling me it's easy.

231
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:25,747
He said he knew spots.

232
00:26:27,484 --> 00:26:28,576
Spots?

233
00:26:28,953 --> 00:26:30,717
Spots to get through.

234
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:34,057
l told him to come talk to you.

235
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,825
-Here?
-Yes.

236
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,489
Rudy, l told you, we don't want anyone
to know that we're here...

237
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:43,567
or that we're trying to cross the border.
Are you that stupid?

238
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:46,535
-l'm not stupid!
-He could tell the police.

239
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:49,067
Okay, so l am stupid.

240
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:52,365
Why don't we just try it anyway?

241
00:26:52,509 --> 00:26:55,205
Because l am working on a deal.

242
00:26:55,713 --> 00:26:56,942
Who with?

243
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:59,442
l can't tell you.

244
00:27:00,751 --> 00:27:03,413
This is crazy.
We're in the middle of the jungle.

245
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:05,113
-Forest.
-Jungle.

246
00:27:06,657 --> 00:27:08,625
l'm a dancer, not Mowgli.

247
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:14,429
l can't dance anymore.
l've walked my feet away.

248
00:27:15,666 --> 00:27:18,795
But you don't mind.
You're working on a deal.

249
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:22,096
You worked on a deal in Berlin,
and now in the jungle.

250
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:23,366
Forest.

251
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:24,801
Jungle.

252
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,134
l want to get out of here.

253
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:34,347
l could have.

254
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:40,848
But you're right.

255
00:27:42,259 --> 00:27:43,625
l'm stupid.

256
00:27:45,763 --> 00:27:48,892
Now you're just hanging around,
waiting for me to die.

257
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:52,102
l think you've poisoned the cheese.

258
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,138
lt's your cheese.

259
00:27:56,807 --> 00:27:58,207
Choke on it.

260
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,641
l can't tell you how much
l want you to choke on it.

261
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:02,905
Christ!

262
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:19,587
Remember cocaine?

263
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:21,588
Yes.

264
00:28:23,634 --> 00:28:25,465
l'd like some cocaine.

265
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,508
What would you like?

266
00:28:31,742 --> 00:28:33,107
New glasses.

267
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,143
My eyes have changed.

268
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,373
l need a new prescription.

269
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:42,845
-l'd like new glasses.
-ln Amsterdam.

270
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:46,017
-Sure.
-ln Amsterdam.

271
00:28:47,858 --> 00:28:49,792
Cocaine and new glasses.

272
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:53,892
You'll have plants.

273
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:56,364
Wonderful Dutch plants.

274
00:28:58,202 --> 00:28:59,829
And dance classes.

275
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,836
And do you know what?

276
00:29:05,442 --> 00:29:07,307
We can buy a Dutch dog.

277
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:12,440
Everyone should have a dog.

278
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,287
Burning.

279
00:29:27,397 --> 00:29:28,523
Don't.

280
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:46,009
l really love you.

281
00:30:01,165 --> 00:30:02,291
Don't.

282
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,665
lf they hear us....

283
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:06,463
They won't hear us.

284
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,000
Streets of Berlin

285
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:17,544
I must leave you soon

286
00:30:38,569 --> 00:30:41,334
Will you forget me?

287
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:43,636
Was I ever really

288
00:30:44,241 --> 00:30:45,299
here?

289
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:47,971
Listen.

290
00:30:51,148 --> 00:30:52,275
Run.

291
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:53,910
Rudy!

292
00:32:18,936 --> 00:32:20,164
Glasses.

293
00:32:24,541 --> 00:32:26,338
Give me your glasses.

294
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:33,781
Horn-rimmed.

295
00:32:36,253 --> 00:32:38,118
-lntelligentsia.
-What?

296
00:32:38,722 --> 00:32:39,984
Stand up.

297
00:32:47,664 --> 00:32:49,461
Step on your glasses.

298
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:57,039
Step on them.

299
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:15,385
Take him.

300
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:20,957
Max!

301
00:33:27,337 --> 00:33:28,599
Glasses.

302
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,007
Don't!

303
00:34:14,418 --> 00:34:16,682
Don't move. You can't help him.

304
00:34:21,525 --> 00:34:23,322
This isn't happening.

305
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,251
lt's happening.

306
00:34:25,896 --> 00:34:27,523
Where are they taking us?

307
00:34:27,998 --> 00:34:29,431
A detention camp.

308
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,557
-Probably Dachau.
-How do you know?

309
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:33,067
l've been through transport.

310
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:35,400
They took me to Cologne
for a propaganda film.

311
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:38,606
-Pink Triangle in Good Health.
-''Pink triangle,'' what's that?

312
00:34:38,775 --> 00:34:41,768
Queer. lf you're queer, that's what you wear.

313
00:34:41,945 --> 00:34:45,711
Like Jews, a yellow star.
Political, a red triangle. Criminal, green.

314
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:48,244
Pink is as low as you can get.

315
00:34:51,088 --> 00:34:52,885
This isn't happening.

316
00:34:55,025 --> 00:34:56,994
This can't be happening.

317
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:01,429
lf you survive the train, you stand a chance.

318
00:35:02,365 --> 00:35:04,458
Here's where they break you.

319
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:07,436
You can do nothing for your friend.

320
00:35:07,771 --> 00:35:10,501
lf you try to help him, they will kill you.

321
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:14,175
lf you try to care for his wounds,
they will kill you.

322
00:35:15,545 --> 00:35:18,447
lf you want to stay alive, he cannot exist.

323
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,887
This can't be happening.

324
00:35:26,356 --> 00:35:28,882
He hasn't a chance. He wore glasses.

325
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,795
lt isn't happening.

326
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:43,262
lt is happening.

327
00:36:48,972 --> 00:36:50,634
Who is this man?

328
00:36:52,976 --> 00:36:54,307
l don't know.

329
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,344
Your friend?

330
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:05,485
Look at him.

331
00:37:10,594 --> 00:37:11,652
Look!

332
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:17,190
-Your friend?
-No.

333
00:37:22,472 --> 00:37:24,304
Your friend?

334
00:37:30,981 --> 00:37:32,744
-Your friend?
-No.

335
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:34,311
Stand up.

336
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:43,887
Hit him.

337
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,034
Like this.

338
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:05,411
-Hit him. lt's your friend.
-No.

339
00:38:07,751 --> 00:38:09,344
Open your eyes.

340
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,550
Again.

341
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:22,061
That's enough.

342
00:38:32,275 --> 00:38:33,675
Your friend?

343
00:38:35,512 --> 00:38:36,945
-No.
-No.

344
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:51,681
Stand up.

345
00:40:08,505 --> 00:40:09,768
Take him.

346
00:42:16,065 --> 00:42:17,226
Hello.

347
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:22,329
-Yellow star?
-What?

348
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:23,831
Jew?

349
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,168
Yes.

350
00:42:26,409 --> 00:42:28,434
l wouldn't have thought it.

351
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,449
How did you get that?

352
00:42:34,751 --> 00:42:36,686
-What?
-Your pink triangle.

353
00:42:37,788 --> 00:42:39,186
l signed a petition.

354
00:42:39,389 --> 00:42:41,722
-What kind?
-For Magnus Hirschfeld.

355
00:42:41,824 --> 00:42:44,554
-He wanted to make queers--
-Legal.

356
00:42:45,528 --> 00:42:47,326
But the Nazis got him.

357
00:42:48,565 --> 00:42:49,726
l was a nurse.

358
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:54,235
They said a queer couldn't be a nurse.
Suppose l had to touch a patient's penis?

359
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:57,735
They said rather than be a nurse,
l should be a prisoner.

360
00:42:57,974 --> 00:42:59,032
So...

361
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:02,510
that's how l got my pink triangle.

362
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,440
How'd you get the yellow star?

363
00:43:05,815 --> 00:43:07,181
l'm Jewish.

364
00:43:07,384 --> 00:43:09,510
You're not Jewish, you're queer.

365
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,443
Maybe l'm both.

366
00:43:11,688 --> 00:43:13,952
-Then you'd wear both.
-l didn't want one.

367
00:43:14,057 --> 00:43:16,925
-Didn't want one?
-You told me it was the lowest.

368
00:43:17,961 --> 00:43:19,862
But so is a yellow star.

369
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:22,697
l didn't want to be a queer...

370
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:25,692
so l worked a deal.

371
00:43:26,936 --> 00:43:28,836
-With the Gestapo?
-Yes.

372
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:31,969
You're full of shit.

373
00:43:39,682 --> 00:43:43,675
l'm going to work a lot of deals in the camp.
Sooner or later, they'll release us.

374
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:46,789
l'm only under protective custody.
That's what they told me.

375
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,259
l'm going to stay alive.

376
00:43:50,393 --> 00:43:53,021
Friendship lasts about 1 2 hours
in this place.

377
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:55,097
We had ours on the train.

378
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:09,275
You didn't think l'd make it, did you?
Off the train.

379
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:13,177
-l wasn't sure.
-l'm going to stay alive.

380
00:44:15,952 --> 00:44:17,750
-Yes.
-Because of you.

381
00:44:18,554 --> 00:44:20,112
You told me how.

382
00:44:21,391 --> 00:44:22,416
Yes.

383
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,119
l did.

384
00:44:28,431 --> 00:44:29,728
l'm sorry.

385
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,731
About what?

386
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:35,637
l don't know.

387
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:37,605
Your friend.

388
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,240
He wasn't my friend.

389
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,021
l made a deal.

390
00:45:04,367 --> 00:45:05,425
What?

391
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:09,833
A deal.

392
00:45:11,074 --> 00:45:12,769
Leave me alone, please.

393
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:14,641
They said...

394
00:45:16,313 --> 00:45:17,677
if l could....

395
00:45:17,914 --> 00:45:19,177
They said....

396
00:45:20,083 --> 00:45:21,141
What?

397
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:24,748
Nothing.

398
00:45:31,461 --> 00:45:33,726
l think, maybe....

399
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:37,356
-Okay--
-l made....

400
00:45:37,701 --> 00:45:39,224
They took me...

401
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:42,264
into that room on the train.

402
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:47,210
And they said, ''Prove that you're....''

403
00:45:49,378 --> 00:45:50,710
And l did.

404
00:45:51,514 --> 00:45:52,777
Did what?

405
00:45:53,784 --> 00:45:55,012
l made love.

406
00:45:55,418 --> 00:45:56,885
-Who to?
-Her.

407
00:45:58,387 --> 00:45:59,514
Only...

408
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:02,253
maybe only 13.

409
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,123
She was dead.

410
00:46:12,869 --> 00:46:14,030
Just....

411
00:46:23,179 --> 00:46:24,670
Bullet in her.

412
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:28,547
They said, ''Prove that you're....''

413
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:30,344
And l did.

414
00:46:32,822 --> 00:46:34,313
Lots of them...

415
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:35,956
watching...

416
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:37,320
laughing, drinking.

417
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:40,224
''He's a bit bent,'' they said. ''He can't.''

418
00:46:41,164 --> 00:46:42,324
But....

419
00:46:44,001 --> 00:46:45,059
How?

420
00:46:45,601 --> 00:46:47,068
l don't know.

421
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,304
l wanted....

422
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,371
To stay alive.

423
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:56,172
-And there was something.
-Something?

424
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,507
Exciting.

425
00:46:58,849 --> 00:46:59,974
Oh, God!

426
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:02,217
l killed him.

427
00:47:04,621 --> 00:47:06,110
Sweet lips.

428
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:09,550
Angel.

429
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,420
-God....
-She was.

430
00:47:15,565 --> 00:47:18,159
She was like an angel to save my life.

431
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:23,199
Don't do that.

432
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,938
You mustn't do that.

433
00:47:27,143 --> 00:47:30,045
For your own sake, you mustn't touch me.

434
00:47:32,248 --> 00:47:34,012
l'm a rotten person.

435
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:42,451
Rotten.

436
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:46,795
No.

437
00:48:21,998 --> 00:48:23,159
Get up.

438
00:48:23,266 --> 00:48:24,666
Jew bastard.

439
00:48:27,737 --> 00:48:28,931
Get up!

440
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:51,025
l'm going to stay alive.

441
00:53:13,289 --> 00:53:14,382
Here.

442
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:17,255
-You will work here.
-Yes, sir.

443
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:20,021
-He'll explain.
-Yes, sir.

444
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:22,822
-l'm watching.
-Yes, sir.

445
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:26,465
-l see everything.
-Yes, sir.

446
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:30,269
-No slacking.
-No, sir.

447
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:36,637
-l see everything.
-Yes, sir.

448
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,338
You.

449
00:53:39,081 --> 00:53:40,014
Yes, sir?

450
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:41,811
-Tell him what to do.
-Yes, sir.

451
00:53:41,918 --> 00:53:43,407
-You.
-Yes, sir?

452
00:53:43,652 --> 00:53:46,746
-Every two hours there is a rest period.
-Yes, sir.

453
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:48,847
-For three minutes.
-Yes, sir.

454
00:53:48,958 --> 00:53:50,789
-Stand at attention.
-Yes, sir.

455
00:53:50,893 --> 00:53:52,657
-Don't move.
-No, sir.

456
00:53:52,762 --> 00:53:54,730
-The bell rings.
-Yes, sir.

457
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:56,355
-You.
-Yes, sir?

458
00:53:56,766 --> 00:53:58,960
-Explain it to him.
-Yes, sir.

459
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:05,836
You're responsible.

460
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:08,237
Yes, sir.

461
00:54:08,344 --> 00:54:09,835
-You.
-Yes, sir?

462
00:54:10,347 --> 00:54:11,938
l see everything.

463
00:54:12,548 --> 00:54:13,811
Yes, sir.

464
00:54:23,793 --> 00:54:25,987
We had a boy like that in school.

465
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,427
Used to lead us in Simon Says.

466
00:54:28,965 --> 00:54:30,056
Okay.

467
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:32,130
-l'll explain.
-Okay.

468
00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:34,427
-We have to move rocks.
-Yes, sir.

469
00:54:34,536 --> 00:54:36,527
-You take one rock at a time.
-Yes, sir.

470
00:54:36,672 --> 00:54:38,300
-Move it over there.
-Yes, sir.

471
00:54:38,407 --> 00:54:41,501
When the entire pile is over there,
you take one rock at a time...

472
00:54:41,644 --> 00:54:43,373
and you move it back.

473
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:46,313
-And move it back?
-Yes.

474
00:54:47,349 --> 00:54:51,376
We move rocks from there to there,
and then back from there to there?

475
00:54:51,487 --> 00:54:53,456
-Yes, sir.
-Why?

476
00:54:53,556 --> 00:54:55,682
Start moving. He's watching.

477
00:55:00,563 --> 00:55:02,793
lt's supposed to drive us mad.

478
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:15,702
-These are heavy.
-You get used to it.

479
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:23,545
-What do you mean, drive us mad?
-Just that.

480
00:55:23,652 --> 00:55:27,452
Makes no sense, serves no purpose.
They do it to drive us mad.

481
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:30,759
-They probably know what they're doing.
-No, they don't.

482
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:32,224
l worked it out.

483
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:35,661
lt's the best job to have.
That's why l got you here.

484
00:55:35,764 --> 00:55:38,063
-What?
-Don't stop. Keep moving.

485
00:55:49,612 --> 00:55:50,806
You two.

486
00:55:51,414 --> 00:55:52,744
Over here.

487
00:55:58,121 --> 00:55:59,952
You were at the stones.

488
00:56:00,289 --> 00:56:02,690
-Was it harder than this?
-l suppose so.

489
00:56:02,791 --> 00:56:03,985
So it was dangerous.

490
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:05,652
-This isn't?
-No.

491
00:56:07,764 --> 00:56:09,731
Don't you think you should have asked me?

492
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:12,733
-Asked you what?
-lf l wanted to move rocks.

493
00:56:17,606 --> 00:56:18,938
lf l wanted to talk to you....

494
00:56:19,074 --> 00:56:21,942
l couldn't ask you.
We're in different barracks.

495
00:56:22,077 --> 00:56:23,443
Thank heaven.

496
00:56:44,967 --> 00:56:46,958
l spent money getting you here.

497
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,436
-Money?
-Yes. l bribed a guard.

498
00:56:49,873 --> 00:56:52,864
-Where did you get money?
-My uncle sent me some.

499
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:54,771
-And you bribed a guard?
-Yes.

500
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,070
-For me?
-Yes.

501
00:56:56,211 --> 00:56:58,338
-You are mad.
-l thought you'd be grateful.

502
00:56:58,481 --> 00:57:00,210
l like cutting stones.

503
00:57:01,284 --> 00:57:02,807
This is insane.

504
00:57:03,318 --> 00:57:06,516
Twelve hours of this a day.
l'll be crazy in a week.

505
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:07,851
Like you.

506
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:10,851
-Jesus.
-l'm sorry l did it.

507
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:13,594
-You're sorry.
-You don't know what's good for you.

508
00:57:13,695 --> 00:57:15,322
This is the best job to have.

509
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:18,559
Moving rocks back and forth, for no reason?
The best job to have?

510
00:57:18,668 --> 00:57:21,295
-Why don't you understand?
-l don't want to understand.

511
00:57:21,403 --> 00:57:23,429
-l don't want to talk to you.
-You have to.

512
00:57:23,539 --> 00:57:25,701
-Why?
-l got you here to talk.

513
00:57:25,809 --> 00:57:28,175
-Hard luck.
-l don't want to talk.

514
00:57:30,346 --> 00:57:32,405
Move your rocks and l'll move mine.

515
00:57:32,548 --> 00:57:34,449
Just don't speak to me.

516
00:57:45,728 --> 00:57:47,855
l thought you'd be grateful.

517
00:59:51,186 --> 00:59:52,585
lt's so hot.

518
00:59:53,056 --> 00:59:55,353
-Burning hot.
-You talked to me.

519
00:59:57,527 --> 00:59:59,460
Weather talk, that's all.

520
01:00:00,295 --> 01:00:01,922
After three days.

521
01:00:02,498 --> 01:00:04,864
Everyone talks about the weather.

522
01:00:11,974 --> 01:00:13,237
Heard a rumor.

523
01:00:13,342 --> 01:00:15,742
-What?
-Sardines tonight.

524
01:00:16,144 --> 01:00:17,907
Don't like sardines.

525
01:00:20,148 --> 01:00:21,639
Only a rumor.

526
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:25,913
Suppose, after all of this...

527
01:00:33,128 --> 01:00:35,358
we have nothing to talk about.

528
01:00:39,601 --> 01:00:41,762
Was l awful to bring you here?

529
01:00:42,105 --> 01:00:44,335
Come on, don't get depressed.

530
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,601
Smile.

531
01:00:50,278 --> 01:00:52,007
You're not smiling.

532
01:00:52,849 --> 01:00:54,476
You can't see me.

533
01:00:55,351 --> 01:00:56,875
l can feel you.

534
01:01:00,188 --> 01:01:02,623
l wish we could look at each other.

535
01:01:03,592 --> 01:01:06,152
l've been looking at you all morning.

536
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:07,353
Yeah?

537
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:09,653
You look sexy.

538
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:11,793
-Me?
-Without your shirt.

539
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:12,867
No.

540
01:01:13,135 --> 01:01:15,570
Come off it. You know you're sexy.

541
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:16,695
No.

542
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:17,931
Liar.

543
01:01:19,574 --> 01:01:21,065
Of course l'm a liar.

544
01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:23,041
Your body's nice, too.

545
01:01:23,246 --> 01:01:25,271
lt's okay, not great.

546
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:26,938
No, it's nice.

547
01:01:27,416 --> 01:01:29,510
Not as nice as yours.

548
01:01:30,318 --> 01:01:31,411
No...

549
01:01:31,788 --> 01:01:33,255
but it's okay.

550
01:01:33,889 --> 01:01:36,255
-How do you know?
-l've been looking, too.

551
01:01:36,358 --> 01:01:37,882
-When?
-All day.

552
01:01:38,293 --> 01:01:39,659
-Yes?
-Yeah.

553
01:01:48,938 --> 01:01:51,463
Listen. Do you...

554
01:01:51,773 --> 01:01:52,865
What?

555
01:01:53,275 --> 01:01:54,503
...miss....

556
01:01:54,811 --> 01:01:55,869
What?

557
01:01:56,311 --> 01:01:57,574
You know.

558
01:01:59,681 --> 01:02:01,012
No, l don't.

559
01:02:01,184 --> 01:02:02,742
Everyone misses it.

560
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:04,476
-No.
-Everyone in the camp.

561
01:02:04,586 --> 01:02:05,610
No.

562
01:02:06,088 --> 01:02:08,353
Come on, no one can hear us.

563
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:13,460
You're not a yellow star with me, remember?

564
01:02:15,465 --> 01:02:16,795
l don't want....

565
01:02:16,898 --> 01:02:17,990
What?

566
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:19,865
To miss it.

567
01:02:20,702 --> 01:02:22,068
But do you?

568
01:02:24,106 --> 01:02:25,130
Yes.

569
01:02:26,976 --> 01:02:28,135
Me, too.

570
01:02:31,313 --> 01:02:32,679
We don't have to.

571
01:02:32,782 --> 01:02:33,873
What?

572
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:35,039
Miss it.

573
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:40,550
We're here together.

574
01:02:41,324 --> 01:02:43,121
We don't have to miss it.

575
01:02:46,195 --> 01:02:49,096
We can't look at each other, we can't touch.

576
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,998
We can feel.

577
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:53,164
-Feel what?
-Each other.

578
01:02:54,369 --> 01:02:56,304
l can feel you right now...

579
01:02:56,405 --> 01:02:57,530
next to me.

580
01:02:58,306 --> 01:03:00,206
-Can you feel me?
-No.

581
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:03,510
Come on, don't be afraid.
No one can hear us.

582
01:03:03,913 --> 01:03:05,471
Can you feel me?

583
01:03:10,418 --> 01:03:11,545
Maybe.

584
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:13,014
Feel me.

585
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:16,985

587
01:03:20,195 --> 01:03:21,423
lt's burning.

588
01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:23,123

589
01:03:24,199 --> 01:03:25,224
Burning.

590
01:03:25,333 --> 01:03:26,960
Kissing your eyes.

591
01:03:27,202 --> 01:03:29,137
-Hot.
-Kissing your lips.

592
01:03:29,237 --> 01:03:30,364

-Down.
-Yes.

596
01:03:36,679 --> 01:03:38,306
Chest to my tongue.

597
01:03:38,748 --> 01:03:39,771
Burning.

598
01:03:39,882 --> 01:03:41,349
-Your chest.
-Your mouth.

599
01:03:41,449 --> 01:03:43,041

-Do you feel my cock?
-Do you feel my mouth?

607
01:03:58,067 --> 01:03:59,090
Yes.

608
01:03:59,302 --> 01:04:00,496
Do you....

609
01:04:00,702 --> 01:04:02,431
Do you know what l'm doing?

610
01:04:02,538 --> 01:04:03,527
Yes.

611
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:05,971
-Can you taste what l'm doing?
-Yes.

612
01:04:06,074 --> 01:04:07,201
Taste.

613
01:04:07,443 --> 01:04:09,239
-Yes, feel.

-l have you.
-l want you.

617
01:04:15,384 --> 01:04:16,976
Do you feel me, inside you?

618
01:04:17,085 --> 01:04:18,713
l want you inside me.

619
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:19,913
Feel.

620
01:04:20,722 --> 01:04:22,987
l have you inside me.

621
01:04:23,291 --> 01:04:25,054
-lnside you.
-Strong.

622
01:04:25,293 --> 01:04:26,760
Do you feel me thrust?

623
01:04:26,896 --> 01:04:28,090
-Hold.
-Stroke.

624
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:29,425
Strong.

625
01:04:29,565 --> 01:04:31,623
Strong.

626
01:04:31,733 --> 01:04:33,224
l'm going to....

627
01:04:33,335 --> 01:04:34,963
Do you feel l'm going to?

628
01:04:35,070 --> 01:04:36,766
-l feel us both.
-Do you?

629
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:37,931
Yes.

630
01:04:39,608 --> 01:04:41,007
Yes, strong.

631
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:42,168
More.

632
01:04:42,478 --> 01:04:44,469
Now, more.

633
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:54,251
Oh, my God!

634
01:05:04,099 --> 01:05:05,327
Did you?

635
01:05:06,702 --> 01:05:08,601
Yes, you?

636
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:10,463
Yes.

637
01:05:13,041 --> 01:05:15,135
You're a good fuck.

638
01:05:15,744 --> 01:05:17,110
So are you.

639
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:20,907
Max?

640
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:23,342
What?

641
01:05:23,952 --> 01:05:25,351
We did it.

642
01:05:25,688 --> 01:05:28,384
Fucking guards, fucking camp, we did it.

643
01:05:29,190 --> 01:05:31,351
They're not going to kill us.

644
01:05:32,295 --> 01:05:35,059
We made love.
We were real, we were human.

645
01:05:35,931 --> 01:05:37,364
We made love.

646
01:05:37,867 --> 01:05:40,061
They're not going to kill us.

647
01:05:44,172 --> 01:05:45,503
l never...

648
01:05:47,242 --> 01:05:48,766
thought we'd...

649
01:05:50,478 --> 01:05:52,378
do it without touching.

650
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:22,097
l dream about rocks.

651
01:07:22,737 --> 01:07:25,331
l close my eyes and l'm moving rocks.

652
01:07:27,409 --> 01:07:28,637
Rocks...

653
01:07:29,110 --> 01:07:30,442
never end.

654
01:07:33,815 --> 01:07:36,717
-l'm going insane.
-Think of something else.

655
01:07:40,422 --> 01:07:42,322
l've been up all night.

656
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:46,887
Someone in our barracks killed himself.

657
01:07:47,429 --> 01:07:48,954
They hate that.

658
01:07:49,297 --> 01:07:51,289
lt's an act of free will.

659
01:07:54,103 --> 01:07:55,364
Heard a rumor.

660
01:07:55,503 --> 01:07:57,494
-Sardines?
-Yes.

661
01:07:57,639 --> 01:08:00,108
l hate sardines. l hate all food.

662
01:08:11,954 --> 01:08:14,047
Scraps, sardine scraps...

663
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:16,489
that's all we get, anyhow.

664
01:08:16,591 --> 01:08:18,219
Not worth eating.

665
01:08:18,426 --> 01:08:21,225
Didn't know you could have sardine scraps.

666
01:08:21,596 --> 01:08:23,757
-l'm going insane.
-All right, it's my fault.

667
01:08:23,865 --> 01:08:26,733
This job's the worst.
l got it wrong, l'm sorry.

668
01:08:28,570 --> 01:08:30,630
l'm glad to be here.

669
01:08:30,738 --> 01:08:32,229
How can you be?

670
01:08:33,975 --> 01:08:35,603
That's my secret.

671
01:08:42,451 --> 01:08:44,612
Maybe if l closed my eyes....

672
01:08:46,788 --> 01:08:48,256
Heard a rumor.

673
01:08:48,524 --> 01:08:49,582
What?

674
01:08:50,926 --> 01:08:52,689
We may get potatoes.

675
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:54,956
-When?
-Tomorrow.

676
01:08:56,030 --> 01:08:59,694
-l don't believe it.
-They said so in my barracks.

677
01:08:59,902 --> 01:09:01,961
-Who is ''they''?
-Some blokes.

678
01:09:02,872 --> 01:09:04,805
-Are they sexy?
-Shut up.

679
01:09:05,673 --> 01:09:09,542
-You should be with us, where you belong.
-No, but you shouldn't be here.

680
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:11,305
l want to be here.

681
01:09:12,948 --> 01:09:13,971
Why?

682
01:09:16,318 --> 01:09:17,784
Because l love rocks...

683
01:09:18,554 --> 01:09:20,283
because l love you.

684
01:09:29,864 --> 01:09:30,957
l do.

685
01:09:31,699 --> 01:09:33,064
l love you.

686
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:35,761
lsn't that silly?

687
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:44,873
What are you doing?

688
01:09:46,548 --> 01:09:48,038
Arranging these neatly.

689
01:09:48,149 --> 01:09:49,582
We've become sloppy.

690
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:51,676
They can beat you for it.

691
01:09:54,489 --> 01:09:55,957
Don't love me.

692
01:10:01,029 --> 01:10:02,520
lt's my secret.

693
01:10:02,831 --> 01:10:04,320
Don't love me.

694
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,461
lt makes me happy.

695
01:10:08,604 --> 01:10:10,367
And l have a signal.

696
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:17,569
When l rub my left eyebrow at you,
like this...

697
01:10:18,713 --> 01:10:20,476
it means l love you.

698
01:10:21,817 --> 01:10:23,909
l bet you didn't know that.

699
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:31,158
Don't love me.

700
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:32,591
l can't help it.

701
01:10:32,694 --> 01:10:35,220
-l don't want anybody to love me.
-Too bad.

702
01:10:35,631 --> 01:10:38,600
-l can't love anybody back.
-Who's asking you to?

703
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:41,930
Queers aren't meant to love.
They don't want us to.

704
01:10:44,872 --> 01:10:46,670
You know who loved me?

705
01:10:46,774 --> 01:10:48,708
Do you know who loved me?

706
01:10:48,810 --> 01:10:50,073
That boy.

707
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:52,680
That dancer.

708
01:10:54,216 --> 01:10:56,740
l don't remember his name, but l killed him.

709
01:10:56,851 --> 01:10:57,841
See?

710
01:10:57,953 --> 01:10:59,944
Queers aren't meant to love.

711
01:11:01,323 --> 01:11:02,984
l'll kill you, too.

712
01:11:03,692 --> 01:11:04,886
Hate me.

713
01:11:05,426 --> 01:11:06,757
That's better.

714
01:11:06,862 --> 01:11:08,193
Hate me...

715
01:11:08,697 --> 01:11:10,186
don't love me.

716
01:11:11,766 --> 01:11:13,757
l'll do what l want to do.

717
01:11:17,405 --> 01:11:20,000
lt isn't any of your business, anyhow.

718
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:30,034
l don't believe we're doing this.

719
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:33,273
Rocks make sense, but not snow.

720
01:12:33,681 --> 01:12:35,239
My hands are....

721
01:12:43,559 --> 01:12:45,253
lt makes a change.

722
01:14:34,168 --> 01:14:36,261
You have a barracks leader.

723
01:14:38,407 --> 01:14:40,704
-He can get you medicine.
-lt doesn't matter.

724
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:44,266
-lf you're nice to the Capo.
-lt doesn't matter.

725
01:14:44,412 --> 01:14:47,506
-You're losing weight.
-l don't like sardines.

726
01:14:57,158 --> 01:14:59,457
-lt's getting worse.
-And it's getting colder.

727
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:01,994
-You need medicine.
-Stop nagging me.

728
01:15:09,938 --> 01:15:11,701
l thought you loved yourself.

729
01:15:11,806 --> 01:15:13,296
lt's too cold.

730
01:15:15,109 --> 01:15:16,440
l'm scared.

731
01:15:17,479 --> 01:15:18,740
Who isn't?

732
01:15:43,704 --> 01:15:45,399
l want you to care.

733
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:48,907
l would, if l was warm.

734
01:15:51,246 --> 01:15:52,712
l'll warm you.

735
01:15:53,314 --> 01:15:54,680
You can't.

736
01:15:55,583 --> 01:15:57,108
l'm next to you.

737
01:15:57,752 --> 01:15:59,152
Don't start.

738
01:15:59,854 --> 01:16:01,652
l'll make love to you.

739
01:16:02,024 --> 01:16:04,015
-Not now.
-Yes, now.

740
01:16:04,292 --> 01:16:07,159
-l have a headache. l can't.
-Don't joke.

741
01:16:07,695 --> 01:16:09,527
l'll make love to you.

742
01:16:09,631 --> 01:16:10,619
No.

743
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,130
l'll make you warm.

744
01:16:15,203 --> 01:16:16,363
You can't.

745
01:16:16,470 --> 01:16:18,268
You'll feel warm.

746
01:16:18,606 --> 01:16:20,597
-l can't.
-You'll feel it.

747
01:16:22,476 --> 01:16:23,966
ln my fingers.

748
01:16:24,712 --> 01:16:25,940
All over.

749
01:16:27,783 --> 01:16:28,976
l can't.

750
01:16:29,751 --> 01:16:31,685
l'm kissing your fingers.

751
01:16:31,987 --> 01:16:33,146
They're numb.

752
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:35,018
My mouth is on fire.

753
01:16:37,225 --> 01:16:39,591
-My fingers....
-Are getting warm.

754
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:40,886
Are they?

755
01:16:41,029 --> 01:16:43,429
They're getting warm.

756
01:16:43,966 --> 01:16:45,024
Yes.

757
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:47,395
My mouth is on fire.

758
01:16:47,502 --> 01:16:49,902
-Yes.
-Your fingers are on fire...

759
01:16:50,037 --> 01:16:51,505
your body's on fire.

760
01:16:51,606 --> 01:16:52,664
Yes.

761
01:16:53,574 --> 01:16:55,099
My mouth is all over you.

762
01:16:56,478 --> 01:16:59,572
My mouth is on your chest,
kissing your chest...

763
01:16:59,948 --> 01:17:01,414
biting your nipple.

764
01:17:01,917 --> 01:17:03,612
-Biting into it.
-Yes.

765
01:17:03,752 --> 01:17:04,945
Harder.

766
01:17:07,088 --> 01:17:08,055
Stop it! That hurts.

767
01:17:08,189 --> 01:17:11,454
-Harder.
-Stop it! l'm serious. You're hurting me.

768
01:17:17,231 --> 01:17:18,529
You pulled away.

769
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:19,965
l did.

770
01:17:23,104 --> 01:17:24,230
lt was exciting.

771
01:17:24,338 --> 01:17:25,930
For you, maybe.

772
01:17:26,073 --> 01:17:28,007
l don't try to hurt you.

773
01:17:28,510 --> 01:17:30,909
l like being hurt, it's exciting.

774
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:32,711
lt's not.

775
01:17:33,015 --> 01:17:34,676
Not when you're rough.

776
01:17:34,783 --> 01:17:36,511
l'm not being rough.

777
01:17:38,319 --> 01:17:40,480
Why did you have to spoil it?

778
01:17:41,789 --> 01:17:43,724
You were making me warm.

779
01:17:44,259 --> 01:17:45,953
Why can't you be gentle?

780
01:17:46,728 --> 01:17:48,457
-l am.
-You're not.

781
01:17:48,829 --> 01:17:50,820
You tried to hurt me.

782
01:17:50,998 --> 01:17:53,627
You make me warm and then you hurt me.

783
01:17:55,302 --> 01:17:56,895
l hurt enough.

784
01:17:57,672 --> 01:17:59,903
l don't want to feel more pain.

785
01:18:03,211 --> 01:18:04,905
Why can't you be gentle?

786
01:18:05,012 --> 01:18:07,037
-l am.
-No, you're like them.

787
01:18:07,149 --> 01:18:10,208
You're like the guards.
You're like the Gestapo.

788
01:18:19,761 --> 01:18:21,729
We stopped being gentle.

789
01:18:22,963 --> 01:18:24,453
l watched it...

790
01:18:24,565 --> 01:18:26,658
when we were on the outside.

791
01:18:28,369 --> 01:18:30,895
People made pain and called it love.

792
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:35,435
l don't want to be like that.

793
01:18:39,213 --> 01:18:41,148
l can't do anything right.

794
01:18:43,685 --> 01:18:45,550
l don't understand you.

795
01:18:48,457 --> 01:18:50,425
l used to do things right.

796
01:18:52,894 --> 01:18:54,360
You still can.

797
01:18:58,667 --> 01:19:00,567
l want to make you happy.

798
01:19:02,537 --> 01:19:04,470
Then be gentle with me.

799
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:06,966
l don't know how.

800
01:19:08,275 --> 01:19:10,608
-Just hold me.
-l'm afraid to hold you.

801
01:19:10,712 --> 01:19:12,577
-Don't be.
-l'm afraid.

802
01:19:12,713 --> 01:19:15,376
-l'm going to drown.
-Hold me, please.

803
01:19:16,051 --> 01:19:17,279
Hold me.

804
01:19:19,354 --> 01:19:20,412
Okay.

805
01:19:25,292 --> 01:19:26,817
l'm holding you.

806
01:19:27,796 --> 01:19:30,697
-Are you?
-You're here in my arms, l promise.

807
01:19:30,998 --> 01:19:33,694
l promise, l'm holding you. You're here.

808
01:19:36,104 --> 01:19:37,297
Touch me.

809
01:19:38,907 --> 01:19:40,498
-Are you?
-Yes.

810
01:19:42,144 --> 01:19:43,372
Touching.

811
01:19:47,748 --> 01:19:48,908
Gently.

812
01:19:50,484 --> 01:19:51,815
Touching...

813
01:19:53,255 --> 01:19:54,381
softly.

814
01:19:55,489 --> 01:19:56,684
Warm me.

815
01:19:57,259 --> 01:19:58,385
Softly.

816
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:01,153
Warm me, gently.

817
01:20:02,497 --> 01:20:03,690
Softly.

818
01:20:06,333 --> 01:20:08,268
l'm touching you softly.

819
01:20:10,005 --> 01:20:11,266
Gently.

820
01:20:12,841 --> 01:20:14,239
You're safe.

821
01:20:15,443 --> 01:20:17,569
l'll keep you safe and warm.

822
01:20:20,815 --> 01:20:22,511
You're with me now.

823
01:20:23,417 --> 01:20:25,476
You'll never be cold again.

824
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:29,118
l'm holding you now...

825
01:20:29,524 --> 01:20:30,717
safe...

826
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:32,988
and warm.

827
01:20:35,029 --> 01:20:36,997
As long as you're here...

828
01:20:38,265 --> 01:20:40,393
as long as you're with me...

829
01:20:41,903 --> 01:20:44,097
as long as l'm holding you...

830
01:20:49,176 --> 01:20:50,576
you're safe.

831
01:22:28,243 --> 01:22:30,176
-lt sounds better.
-lt does?

832
01:22:30,278 --> 01:22:32,074
-Loosening up.
-lt is?

833
01:22:32,279 --> 01:22:34,510
-Medicine's helping?
-Yes.

834
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:37,106
How did you get it?

835
01:22:37,217 --> 01:22:38,275
l told you...

836
01:22:38,386 --> 01:22:41,082
l spoke to my barracks leader.
He took me to an officer.

837
01:22:41,189 --> 01:22:42,417
Which one?

838
01:22:42,524 --> 01:22:44,548
Some captain, the new one.

839
01:22:56,438 --> 01:22:58,302
Why don't you tell me?

840
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:01,666
-You're never going to let up, are you?
-Probably not.

841
01:23:01,775 --> 01:23:04,073
-Suppose you don't like the answer?
-l'll chance it.

842
01:23:04,179 --> 01:23:05,942
l went down on him.

843
01:23:06,046 --> 01:23:07,639
-What?
-You heard.

844
01:23:07,748 --> 01:23:09,306
-l didn't.
-You wanted to know.

845
01:23:09,417 --> 01:23:11,817
l told you you wouldn't like it.

846
01:23:12,186 --> 01:23:13,779
That SS Captain?

847
01:23:14,088 --> 01:23:16,386
-He's the worst bastard in the--
-l know.

848
01:23:21,762 --> 01:23:25,460
-You went down on him?
-l had to, l didn't have any money.

849
01:23:26,234 --> 01:23:29,260
-You touched him?
-No, l just went down on him.

850
01:23:29,436 --> 01:23:32,372
That's what he wanted.
l needed the medicine.

851
01:23:32,474 --> 01:23:34,998
-l'd rather cough.
-You wouldn't.

852
01:23:39,381 --> 01:23:40,847
That bastard.

853
01:23:43,283 --> 01:23:45,514
-ls he queer?
-Who knows?

854
01:23:45,953 --> 01:23:47,716
Just felt like it, maybe.

855
01:23:48,122 --> 01:23:51,024
He could be queer,
but you don't like to think about that.

856
01:23:51,126 --> 01:23:53,423
-You don't want them to be queer.
-l don't.

857
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:54,994
That's silly.

858
01:23:57,698 --> 01:24:00,327
For once you're right. lt is silly.

859
01:24:01,403 --> 01:24:03,337
There are queer Nazis...

860
01:24:03,438 --> 01:24:05,667
and queer saints, and queer geniuses...

861
01:24:05,774 --> 01:24:07,104
and queer nobodies...

862
01:24:07,207 --> 01:24:08,606
just people.

863
01:24:09,243 --> 01:24:12,735
That's why l'm wearing this triangle.
That's why you should be wearing it.

864
01:24:12,846 --> 01:24:15,680
Do you think the Captain
would let a queer go down on him?

865
01:24:15,783 --> 01:24:17,944
Somebody straight, yeah, even a Jew.

866
01:24:18,052 --> 01:24:20,578
He would kill me if he knew l was a queer.

867
01:24:20,688 --> 01:24:23,087
My yellow star got your medicine.

868
01:24:23,792 --> 01:24:25,783
-Who needs it?
-Then give it back.

869
01:24:25,894 --> 01:24:28,453
Throw it away, why don't you? And die.

870
01:24:28,595 --> 01:24:31,997
l am tired of being told
l should have a pink triangle.

871
01:24:50,484 --> 01:24:52,418
Ever go to the Silhouette?

872
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:53,543
Yes.

873
01:24:54,288 --> 01:24:56,119
l never saw you there.

874
01:24:56,291 --> 01:24:58,020
You weren't looking.

875
01:24:59,293 --> 01:25:01,023
-Greta's Club?
-No.

876
01:25:01,162 --> 01:25:02,856
Good, you had taste.

877
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:05,288
The White Mouse?

878
01:25:05,667 --> 01:25:06,997
Sometimes.

879
01:25:07,268 --> 01:25:09,327
l'm surprised you never saw me there.

880
01:25:09,436 --> 01:25:10,926
Did you sunbathe?

881
01:25:11,072 --> 01:25:12,630
l loved to sunbathe.

882
01:25:12,739 --> 01:25:14,970
-ln the nude?
-Of course.

883
01:25:15,076 --> 01:25:17,100
-By the river.
-That's right.

884
01:25:17,912 --> 01:25:19,675
And you never saw me?

885
01:25:20,914 --> 01:25:22,746
Actually, l did.

886
01:25:22,850 --> 01:25:25,752
l saw you by the river.
You were making a fool of yourself...

887
01:25:25,854 --> 01:25:29,949
and l said, ''Some day l'll be at Dachau
with that man, moving rocks.''

888
01:25:31,091 --> 01:25:32,854
l didn't like Berlin.

889
01:25:33,127 --> 01:25:34,993
l mean, l wasn't happy.

890
01:25:35,497 --> 01:25:38,363
But l like it now. l miss it.

891
01:25:39,766 --> 01:25:41,631
We'll go back someday.

892
01:25:42,203 --> 01:25:44,534
-When we get out of here?
-Yes.

893
01:25:45,405 --> 01:25:46,872
We will, won't we?

894
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:48,601
We have to, don't we?

895
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:49,734
Yes.

896
01:25:51,246 --> 01:25:52,872
-Horst?
-What?

897
01:25:53,948 --> 01:25:55,939
We could go back together.

898
01:26:16,871 --> 01:26:18,600
You. Jew.

899
01:26:18,706 --> 01:26:19,934
Yes, sir?

900
01:26:21,341 --> 01:26:23,207
Are you feeling better?

901
01:26:24,212 --> 01:26:25,270
Sir?

902
01:26:29,417 --> 01:26:30,475
Your cold?

903
01:26:30,585 --> 01:26:31,813
Yes, sir.

904
01:26:32,453 --> 01:26:34,283
-Remarkable.
-Yes, sir.

905
01:26:35,489 --> 01:26:36,717
Carry on.

906
01:26:51,738 --> 01:26:52,762
You!

907
01:26:53,574 --> 01:26:55,872
-Pervert.
-Yes, sir?

908
01:26:56,711 --> 01:26:58,076
Are you ill?

909
01:26:58,479 --> 01:26:59,537
No, sir.

910
01:26:59,646 --> 01:27:01,204
You have a cough.

911
01:27:01,315 --> 01:27:02,510
No, sir.

912
01:27:03,318 --> 01:27:05,444
Something caught in your throat?

913
01:27:05,552 --> 01:27:07,520
-Yes, sir.
-From breakfast?

914
01:27:07,721 --> 01:27:08,949
Yes, sir.

915
01:27:10,958 --> 01:27:12,186
Carry on.

916
01:27:27,875 --> 01:27:30,435
-You. Pervert.
-Yes, sir?

917
