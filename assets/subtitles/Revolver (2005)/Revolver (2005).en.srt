1
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,856
One thing I've learned in the last seven years,

2
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:25,258
in every game and con there is always
an opponent and there is always a victim.

3
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:31,698
The trick is to know when you're the latter,
so you can become the former.

4
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,534
How deep did you bury that shareholder, Paul?

5
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,531
Deep.

6
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,415
Are you sure this is a good idea?

7
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,371
He has to pay us something, doesn't he?

8
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,332
But you've got more money
than you could ever spend.

9
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,530
That's all you think about nowadays.

10
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,571
He owes me and he owes you.

11
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,611
Now he has to pay.

12
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,651
It's cause and effect.

13
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,649
Sorry, sir, this table is closed.

14
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,219
Send him up.

15
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,775
I'm not sure that's a good idea, Mr. D.
He's got better. I mean, a lot better.

16
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,219
All the tables are closed.

17
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,651
Send him up, Paul.

18
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,938
20.

19
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,971
Hold on.

20
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,056
I think we'll take the stairs, eh, Billy?

21
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,977
You want to walk 20 flights, Jake?

22
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,373
Don't be silly.

23
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,492
I don't like to feel trapped. Never did, never will.

24
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,692
Why should a man
do what he doesn't like to do?

25
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:57,858
Jake, if you want to take the stairs,
we'll take the stairs...

26
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,017
There's always a choice.
What's wrong with the stairs?

27
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,053
Come on, you'll be all right.

28
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,940
I've got to spend the next two minutes

29
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:29,770
shaking and sweating like a crack whore
clucking for a fix.

30
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:37,134
Should have taken the stairs,
cos it's getting very, very tight in here.

31
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,419
I'm afraid it's only two at the table, Mr. Green.

32
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,851
Freddy, you're done.

33
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,257
Have a seat, Mr. Green.

34
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,168
I hear you've done very well for yourself...

35
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,977
...and against all the odds.

36
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,615
They do say, the harder the battle
the sweeter the victory.

37
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,536
A wise man once told me
there's only one rule in this world,

38
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,889
a small question that drives all success.

39
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:33,493
The more a man invests in that question,
the more powerful that man will become.

40
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,214
Can you guess what that question is, Mr. Green?

41
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:43,617
What's in it for me?

42
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:50,139
I've been warned
if I let you sit down at this table I might regret it.

43
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:54,337
They say you've become
very ambitious in your maturing,

44
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:57,531
and you now wish to acquire yourself
a business,

45
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,775
a business like my business?

46
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,209
But we both know what you are, don't we, Jake?

47
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:07,776
You're a man who needs a master.
You're an employee.

48
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,811
So, what's in it for me?

49
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,654
The pleasure of doing an old employee a favor,

50
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:19,251
by reminding him of the position
nature chose for him.

51
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,689
Rade, how much have you got?

52
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,537
What's that got to do with you?

53
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,969
Toss you for it.

54
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,889
He's got you there, Rade.

55
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,492
It's not worth a heart attack. Get on with it.

56
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,048
I'll toss you for a tenth.

57
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,775
You're a risk-taker of the highest caliber,
ain't you, Rade?

58
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,691
I'll take red.

59
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:02,020
Very impressive, Mr. Green.
You've honed those talents most skillfully.

60
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,654
Pay the man his money, Billy.

61
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,531
Should have bet the whole lot, Rade.

62
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,089
You have to teach me that trick sometime.

63
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,811
You're on.

64
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,893
I'll toss you for everything under your chin.

65
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,728
There isn't a problem is there, Mr. D?

66
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:32,136
You've got a big mouth on a small head,
sunshine.

67
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,977
Be my guest.

68
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,732
I'll take purple.

69
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,771
You're on.

70
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,576
It's a lovely color, purple,

71
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:50,569
discretely sandwiched within
the color spectrum between blue and white.

72
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,335
Always a royal winner.

73
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,855
Billy, do the honors.

74
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,408
Don't you fucking move.

75
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:11,055
Don't let your mouth put you in more trouble
than your body could handle.

76
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,695
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll exercise a bit of charity.

77
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,935
Double or quits?

78
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,736
You're on.

79
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,689
Come on.

80
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:35,652
Mr. Green, Mr. Macha would appreciate it
if you came back to the table.

81
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,131
I haven't finished with him yet.

82
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,971
Now would be a good time.

83
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,655
I think it's time to fly, don't you, Jake?

84
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,051
- Excuse me.
- We're coming through here.

85
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,615
Relax. You're in trouble, Mr. Green.
We could help.

86
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,651
Thank you.

87
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:09,093
I take the stairs.

88
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,931
He got lucky, Mr. D, that's all.

89
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,971
Fuck luck, the man's a danger.

90
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:28,330
Since he's been out, he's made a fortune, Mr. D.
He's fat and comfortable.

91
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,770
He's got what he wanted.
I'm sure we won't be hearing from him again.

92
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,096
He ate seven years, Paul.
Seven years doesn't taste nice.

93
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:38,132
Not to mention the accident
with his brother's wife.

94
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:45,293
And what the fuck does
"I haven't finished with him yet" mean?

95
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,571
Get rid of him.

96
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,571
And I don't want any mistakes.

97
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,010
No crackheads with sharp sticks
acting like silly fucking gangsters.

98
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:03,258
You take Sorter and Slim Biggins.
You do it quickly, you do it quietly.

99
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,128
We don't know what caused the blackout.

100
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:10,856
But we've run some blood tests
and we'll have the results within a few hours.

101
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,977
It's a miracle
you didn't sustain any damage from your fall.

102
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,419
Can I go now?

103
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,530
Once you've put your clothes back on.

104
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,650
We'll call you back with the results.

105
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,935
All right, look, I'll take your man back.

106
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,971
Billy. You go home.

107
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,011
It's late.

108
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,171
Go easy now, yeah?

109
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,330
Joe.

110
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,130
Joe.

111
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,375
Jake. Move.
- Joe.

112
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,058
Move. Get the hell out of here.

113
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,017
Al, drive the fucking car.

114
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,574
Sit down and hold on.

115
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,893
Get in the car.

116
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,933
If I wanted you dead,
I would have shot you already.

117
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,499
Sit back and be quiet.

118
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,971
What?

119
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,817
He missed?

120
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,940
Sorter never fucking misses.

121
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,653
I don't know what happened.

122
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,895
Something went wrong.

123
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,931
I had him in my sights...

124
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,493
three times.

125
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,810
You never miss, let alone three times.

126
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,135
Somebody told him we was coming.

127
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,855
Something is very wrong here.

128
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,016
Yeah, something's fucking wrong all right.

129
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,851
Don't make me angry, Slim.

130
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:47,138
I might have missed him,
but I ain't going to miss you, not at this range.

131
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,931
Maybe it's better you just drive.

132
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:59,611
Doreen, Mr. Green. Mr. Green, Doreen.

133
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,571
Good morning, Mr. Green.

134
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,731
Avi, Mr. Green.

135
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,817
Mr. Green, Avi.

136
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,737
Sit down.

137
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,531
I gather you're quite the player?

138
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:27,219
I'm a bit of an enthusiast myself.
I thought maybe we could have a few games.

139
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:30,536
I think you should tell me what is going on,
don't you?

140
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:35,453
We have your medical results from the hospital.

141
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,253
It's not important how we got them.

142
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,339
What is important, however,
is what it has to say.

143
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,929
You will die within three days
from a very unpleasant ailment

144
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,289
that contaminates your blood and organs.

145
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:03,055
Thanks, fellas.
I'll get back to you on this one, yeah?

146
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,617
Mr. Green.

147
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,572
30 seconds, and you can be on your way.

148
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,498
The longer you listen, the sweeter the pitch.

149
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,371
30 seconds?

150
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:30,373
We've already saved your life once.
The next time will not be for free.

151
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,134
We shall assist you under two conditions.

152
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,740
These conditions are not negotiable.

153
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,578
Oh, I'm being grafted.

154
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,973
Condition one.

155
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,571
We will bleed you dry.

156
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,056
You have to put on a better shirt
before you bleed me dry, my friend.

157
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,695
You will give us every penny you have got.

158
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,015
This is a con.

159
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:58,496
It's only natural that you think that
you are somehow being conned,

160
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,169
but think a little harder,
and you will realize that this is not a trick.

161
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,018
Now, condition two.

162
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,894
You will do as we tell you without argument.

163
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:15,298
This includes
answering any questions that are asked.

164
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:20,778
You don't have a lot of time,
and, in reality, you don't have a choice.

165
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:26,539
Now, the most sensible thing to do
would be to get a second opinion.

166
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,571
Macha has unleashed his legions.

167
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,851
We can protect you from the dangers you face.
That is our deal.

168
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:39,535
You have three hours to decide.
After that, you will be beyond our help.

169
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,458
Think I'm going to part with
my hard-earned cash

170
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,730
for a set of home-made hospital results?

171
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,771
I don't think so.

172
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,697
Not today.

173
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,655
I don't have good news, I'm afraid, Mr. Green.

174
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:09,613
They've thought this one through all right.
Oh, they're smart.

175
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,891
Smart as a pair of a little boy's shoes.

176
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,931
She has to be in on it.

177
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,971
That's how they got the results.

178
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,898
Got to find someone they couldn't have got to.

179
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,215
Well, Jake...

180
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,171
I'm sorry, there's...

181
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,211
there's no easy way to tell you this.

182
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,696
You have a rare blood disease.

183
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,971
How did they get to him?

184
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,777
He's in on it.

185
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,099
After a few days I think...

186
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:53,058
- How much did they pay you?
- What? Who?

187
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,135
How much?

188
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,899
What are you talking about?
I have no idea what you mean.

189
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,693
You've got five seconds. Five...

190
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,174
I have no idea what you're talking about.

191
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,972
- Four...
- Wh? I...

192
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,329
- Three... Two...
- I don't know what you mean.

193
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,018
God. No, no.

194
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,735
When you're winning,
who thinks about losing?

195
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,568
But when you're faced with what I'm looking at,

196
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:20,249
a new and cold reality dawns.

197
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:25,129
A fact we like to ignore.

198
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,740
You can not win.

199
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:31,534
The only prize they guarantee
when you play this game

200
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,571
is that you will lose.

201
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,174
It's only a question of when.

202
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:43,411
I made a mistake.

203
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:48,250
You never miss,
so why now and why three times?

204
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,535
I had a bad feeling.

205
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,456
"Feeling?"

206
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,659
I'm not sure if I paid you to have feelings,
now, did I, Sorter?

207
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,932
I paid you
because you're the best in the business.

208
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:13,576
Why would you let feelings
confuse that relationship?

209
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,531
Listen to me.

210
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,697
Urgency has become something of an issue.

211
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:24,130
So if you could restrain those feelings

212
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:30,050
until you've completed the mission,
I would be most grateful.

213
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,850
Do you think you could do that for me?

214
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,777
Sure.

215
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,811
I'd appreciate it.

216
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:58,814
If there is one thing I have learnt
about experts, they're experts on fuck all.

217
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:04,650
If there's a rule, you can bend it.
If there's a law, it can be broken.

218
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:13,419
From now on, I am breaking all the rules,
because desperate men do desperate deeds.

219
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,374
Cash just seems to remain king, doesn't it?

220
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,414
New bills. Not too many of them in this town.

221
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,057
I love a new bill.

222
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,410
Represents so much hope.
Look how clean and stiff it is.

223
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,530
It even smells proud.

224
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:44,892
Your work starts now. You'll be driving.

225
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:55,057
We are, and I apologize for the
unnecessarily dramatic moniker, loan sharks.

226
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:59,810
People hate and fear us,
just like you will learn to hate and fear us.

227
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,976
We know how much you love a dollar bill,

228
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:06,138
and it won't be easy watching them
fall through your hands,

229
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:09,172
because it will be your money
that we will be loaning.

230
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,211
Don't say a word.

231
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,172
Just hold the bag
and if we nod, leave it on the table.

232
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,251
There's nothing left.

233
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:33,333
That's a very sad story, Mr. Horowitz.
My sympathies are with you and your colleague.

234
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:37,612
Maybe I am being conned,
maybe I am being fooled.

235
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:41,858
Excuse us for having to know
the reason for your loan,

236
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,619
but we have to assess our clients very carefully.

237
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:49,336
They say the sentence has been passed,
the certificate signed, so what's the point?

238
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,577
The point is, this is the only option.

239
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:01,413
If you snap those fingers at me again,
I'll fucking break 'em.

240
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,736
You know our rates, right?

241
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,853
And our policies?

242
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,892
No offence, gentlemen,
but you have a reputation.

243
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,454
I wouldn't be speaking to you if I had a choice.

244
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:31,019
It's a strange thing,
but I still don't like to give it away.

245
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:37,978
I know I can't take it with me, so why the pain?

246
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:41,494
Why the fuck does it still hurt?

247
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:54,332
And greasing the sheaths of these two pricks
isn't making it any easier.

248
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,130
We need to know your history with Macha.

249
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,296
How much of it?

250
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,774
All of it.

251
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:23,929
Macha had these three clowns working for him
called the three Eddies.

252
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,016
Flash, loud, proud and stupid.

253
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:30,099
They were looking after these shitty little games
going on all over the city.

254
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:34,099
They were wild and dangerous,
but if you won they paid well.

255
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:37,655
Macha had lost his card man
just before a big game.

256
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:42,216
Anyway they knew I could play,
so they wanted me to take his place.

257
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:45,411
Like any man who was thinking, I refused.

258
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:48,258
So they started to lean on
my brother and his family.

259
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,655
He'd just had a little girl at the time and...

260
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,890
...the whole situation was getting messy.

261
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:57,091
# How many legs has daddy long-legs got?

262
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,655
So, for the sake of keeping the peace,
I rolled over and agreed to play.

263
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,736
I won, and I was done.

264
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,771
That's very good, Mr. Green,

265
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:09,177
but tell me, does your mum...
from a donkey?

266
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:14,017
Then some cowboy starts mouthing off.

267
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,971
I wasn't having any of that shit.

268
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,931
I'm not having any of that shit.

269
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,011
I've got a funny one for you too, George.

270
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:25,450
Very funny, George.
This one will make you laugh.

271
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:32,011
Next thing you know, it's a gunfight,
people get hurt and money disappears.

272
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:35,769
Two weeks later, someone drops my name
and I'm being questioned.

273
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:40,257
The Eddies thought I might talk,
so they threatened my brother's daughter.

274
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:43,929
The mother reacted badly, like they do
when their little ones are in danger.

275
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,131
They got into a fight
and she took an angry stray bullet.

276
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:50,934
My brother lost his wife
and his daughter lost her mother.

277
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,057
I lost my sense of humor and seven years

278
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,649
because I wouldn't tell the authorities
that Macha had organized the games.

279
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:03,372
Sometime after that,
the Eddies upset Macha in some way,

280
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:08,414
so he had them used as aggregate and mixed
into some concrete on one of his buildings.

281
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,337
Macha had to pay something, didn't he?

282
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:20,059
And I know nothing hurts more than humiliation
and a little money loss.

283
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,411
I employ hundreds of people.

284
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,451
They have to be paid tomorrow.

285
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,889
We need three more days.

286
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,658
Try to understand.

287
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,411
What did I sign up for?

288
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:48,330
Don't try to make sense out of it, not now,
cos it doesn't make sense.

289
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:53,250
I just know if you start a job then finish it.

290
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,449
I promise.

291
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,491
Yes, you will.

292
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,690
Goddamn right.

293
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:06,131
Their idea of discretion is to choose a motel

294
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,933
whose only clients are blood,
come and afro sheen.

295
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,971
Make yourself at home.

296
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,011
You'll be hearing from us.

297
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,253
We can't see Gold.

298
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,860
What are you talking about?
I've been here for an hour.

299
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,050
I'm not the one
who asked for a fucking meeting.

300
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:30,615
Apparently, no-one sees Gold.
We've got one of his representatives, Walker.

301
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:33,379
- Lilly Walker?
- That's right.

302
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:00,055
Mr. Macha, I don't think we've met.

303
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,091
I'm Miss Walker.

304
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:04,415
I work for Mr. Gold. Do you mind if we walk?

305
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,810
I understand you have been commissioned
to do some work for us?

306
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:12,852
I thought it might be a good idea
if we had a little chat

307
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:17,291
to make sure you understand the gravity
of the endeavor you have undertaken.

308
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,729
Yeah, I do, I understand.

309
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:23,693
Everything's set. The date hasn't changed,
you'll get the powder by Friday.

310
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:28,450
Good. Mr. Gold has put his faith in you,
and he has people to please.

311
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,173
We've heard
you might be having some problems?

312
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,211
No, no.

313
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,649
We don't like publicity, Mr. Macha.

314
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:39,170
No, neither do I.
I won't let you down, I won't let Mr. Gold down.

315
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,535
So, we're clear?

316
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:13,089
Mr. Gold doesn't give more time

317
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,938
or second chances.

318
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:22,738
As you can appreciate, there is no shortage
of people who wish to do business with Mr. Gold.

319
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,293
Good day.

320
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,978
Here's your money.

321
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,738
What now?

322
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,691
Have a seat.

323
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:26,330
We need to know how much time you did,
and who you did it with.

324
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,972
Why?

325
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,692
"Why?"

326
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,492
The deal is we ask the questions.

327
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,171
I had two choices inside,

328
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:44,735
14 years' normal time or seven years' solitary.

329
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,892
I chose the solitary.

330
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:00,213
I spent 20 hours a day locked up
in between two salty convicts

331
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:03,730
who had been down there for more years
than they cared to remember.

332
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:06,931
One was a chess master,
the other a master conman.

333
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,971
They had never seen or spoken to each other,

334
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:12,615
but they might as well have been married,
they knew so much about one another.

335
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,139
Once a day, the library on wheels

336
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,978
would be pushed around
by a pair of axe-murdering twins,

337
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,295
that had pushed the trolley for 22 years.

338
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:26,130
My neighbors used to write down chess moves
and concepts of the con

339
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,297
in the back pages of books
based on subjects like...

340
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:36,939
Theoretical Astrophysics Part Four,
The Mathematics Of Quantum Mechanics.

341
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:39,175
They just used them for the con.

342
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:43,498
I used to intercept the books, because
I was sandwiched in between their cells.

343
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:48,091
It's a dangerous combination, chess and cons.

344
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:51,496
These boys were locked up on their own
for ten years with no distractions.

345
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:55,533
Nothing to do but think about
how to steal one another's pieces.

346
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,616
Yeah, they thought.

347
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,779
They really thought.

348
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:05,449
I was under the impression that I was
the clever bastard before I went in.

349
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:10,096
But these boys were a completely different
class. Head tricksters of the premier division.

350
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:14,133
Their sole ambition was to create
the ultimate con and win the ultimate game,

351
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:17,013
always thinking quicker, always thinking bigger.

352
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:21,497
Gradually, they thought
they'd found a formula to the con. Check.

353
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:25,294
A formula to win the ultimate win, the formula.

354
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,296
I couldn't understand the depth of it,

355
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:30,457
but they were confident it was real
and I believed them.

356
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:34,899
After all, they'd been right on everything else,

357
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:38,171
so now they felt they'd had their moment

358
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:41,530
and it was time for them
to leave the confines of their cell.

359
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:44,572
The concrete and steel wasn't even mentioned.

360
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:47,737
I didn't even doubt them.
They got whatever they wanted anyway.

361
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:51,489
I could smell their food
through 12 inches of concrete.

362
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,895
Bastards knew it used to drive me mad.

363
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,090
You bastards.

364
00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:00,338
We were all going to go together,
they swore to me. "You're coming with us, Jake."

365
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:03,975
And I trusted them.
Never for a second did I doubt them.

366
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,409
Next day, they were gone without a trace.

367
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,054
For the next week,
the authorities tore the place apart.

368
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:14,094
Couldn't find evidence of their existence,
let alone their exit. They just evaporated.

369
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,698
Check.

370
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,856
Two years later, I was out.

371
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,095
But those two knew everything about me.

372
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:30,933
Everything. All my dirty little secrets,
how much money I had, where I kept it.

373
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:33,130
The hustling bastards cleaned me out.

374
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:36,968
They didn't leave so much
as a pair of socks, only a note.

375
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:41,093
Rule one: You can only get smarter
by playing a smarter opponent.

376
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:47,014
But I had their formula and

377
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:49,449
it worked.

378
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,491
It really worked.

379
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,850
Not doing you much good now, is it?

380
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,971
Checkmate.

381
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:04,296
He needs to get moving.
Give him the addresses.

382
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,731
Why are they dragging this on?

383
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:28,011
They could just clean me out in one hit.

384
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,971
They want me to suffer.

385
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:36,056
These twisted bastards are making me pay.
Pay for my own pain.

386
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:40,979
Hands down, that's the most radical concept
I have ever heard of...

387
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,580
...and a part of me dies every time I think about it.

388
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:52,214
I told myself if this is my last round,
they'll have to tear me out, piece by piece,

389
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,774
but this I can't take.

390
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,617
They've found a weakness.

391
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:01,618
Caught me fair and square, cross-haired,

392
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:06,290
blind-folded, one foot in the grave
and two hands on the coffin.

393
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:12,017
I'm cooked, well done,
stick a fork in me and see if I bleed.

394
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,856
- Checkmate.
- You're quite good at this game, Mr. Green.

395
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,129
I am stuck in a trance...

396
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:28,219
...somewhere between hell and a hard place...

397
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,728
...in a gear that doesn't exist,

398
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,731
and all I want now...

399
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,771
...is a little peace.

400
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,971
Where are you?

401
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:46,488
- At the old lady's house.
- Does she have it?

402
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:49,737
Of course she doesn't have it.
She's barely got a heartbeat.

403
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:52,533
How the hell is this woman
going to get that kind of money?

404
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:55,014
That's what she owes. Any furniture?

405
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,812
No.

406
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:01,249
Take the dog.

407
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,768
I am not taking the dog.

408
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:06,493
- Then take the TV.
- The TV don't work.

409
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,098
Then get your ass over here.

410
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,051
How do you sleep at night?

411
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,091
How are we doing?

412
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,812
Ask the man.

413
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,851
No thanks, darling.

414
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,050
Time's up, lets go.

415
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,771
Mr. Green, you took your time.

416
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:47,294
- Did you get anything from the old lady?
- No.

417
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,331
Did you get anything from Horowitz?

418
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,371
- No.
- Why not?

419
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,411
Because he didn't have it.

420
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:56,258
Listen, pal, either he pays or you pay.

421
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,291
I pay anyway.

422
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,331
Don't be a smartass.

423
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:05,614
Look, man,
we are not sending you out to polish door knobs.

424
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,651
You've got to get with it, man.

425
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,771
Doreen, take his car.

426
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:14,254
Come with us.

427
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,291
What is this?

428
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,331
Where was security?

429
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,575
They gassed them. We found them tied up.

430
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:26,655
Hold tight, Mr. Green.

431
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:35,775
It was a 12-ton Hermann and Ziegler safe, Mr. D.
It was impossible to break into.

432
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,492
Time's up, let's go.

433
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:41,374
Obviously, it wasn't fucking impossible
to move, was it, Paul?

434
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,651
What did anyone take it for?

435
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:49,214
We don't even use that safe, do we, Paul?

436
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,296
Checkmate.

437
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,858
How in the hell did you do that?

438
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,891
Not usually, no.

439
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,654
Sam Gold's powder was in there.
It came in yesterday.

440
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:15,132
No, Paul, you're wrong.

441
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,248
Try again.

442
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,251
You stupid motherfucker.

443
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,776
That should rattle him.

444
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,288
What the fuck was it doing
on one of our properties?

445
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,615
Why don't you just fucking rape me, Paul?

446
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,971
Pull the troops together.

447
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:46,534
Break some bones, hurt some people, results.

448
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,571
- You hear me?
- I'll take care of it.

449
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:51,532
You're damn straight
you're going to fucking take care of it.

450
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:54,492
The word "excuse" does not exist
in Sam Gold's lexicon.

451
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:57,816
We are the walking dead
until you fucking remedy this situation.

452
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:00,055
- Do you understand?
- I'll take care of it.

453
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:03,888
I said, do you understand?

454
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,931
- Yes.
- You'd better.

455
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,096
In the meantime, get some more powder.

456
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:12,735
I don't care where it comes from
or how much it costs, just get it.

457
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:16,455
There's only one man who can get us
that amount on such short notice.

458
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,297
Who?

459
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,217
Lord John.

460
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:30,012
No way. I'm not nourishing the competition.

461
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,415
That's twice the market price.

462
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:50,653
Sorry, we can't help, Mr. Paul.

463
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,691
Tony'll show you the way out.

464
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:58,972
All right. Hold on, hold on.

465
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,416
I am prepared to talk.

466
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,855
What do you want to talk about?

467
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,611
OK, get it.

468
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,651
What?

469
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,691
Am I having <i>déjà-vu</i>, Paul?

470
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,731
Didn't I just say "get it"?

471
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,692
This is Sam Gold
I have found myself chained to.

472
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,731
Mr. Black Magic.

473
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,771
Mr. "l-run-this-game" Gold.

474
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:53,608
Not some plastic gangster
with a pocketknife for backup.

475
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:58,529
Gold doesn't give second chances, Paul.
I want in and I want rewards.

476
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,211
Got it?

477
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,011
Paul,

478
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:17,578
when you make the deal, keep both eyes
on that untrustworthy, greedy motherfucker.

479
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:17,368
If anyone asks, you don't speak the language.

480
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:27,098
After you, Mr. Green.

481
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:29,176
I'm taking the stairs.

482
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,778
What's the problem, Mr. Green?

483
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:34,449
- I don't like elevators.
- What are you scared of?

484
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,537
Are you fucking deaf?
I said I just don't like them.

485
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:39,775
Tough, because you're getting in.

486
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:51,655
Everything?

487
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:58,572
If he wants a fucking war,
I'm going to give him a fucking war.

488
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:02,169
I don't think it was Lord John, Mr. D.
He knows you'd come looking for him.

489
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:05,815
He's not far from wrong. Because
that is exactly what I'm going to fucking do.

490
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,411
I'll take the stairs.

491
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:17,215
Before we do anything, Mr. D,
we have to get Sam Gold his powder.

492
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,694
- Don't pull the trigger...
- Shut your fucking mouth.

493
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,458
- I'll get out.
- You ain't going nowhere.

494
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,651
I said you're staying right here.

495
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:30,659
Get rid of the Lord...
there will be consequences.

496
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:35,055
Do I look like I'm afraid of the consequences?

497
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,940
- I'm taking the stairs.
- You ain't going nowhere.

498
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,459
You motherfucking listen.

499
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:44,697
Look at me. You think I'm afraid
of the fucking consequences?

500
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,412
- Take the stairs.
- You listen to me.

501
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:52,175
You open your mouth one more fucking time,
I'll blow your fucking head off.

502
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:53,972
Fuck him.

503
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,373
Fuck the consequences.

504
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,931
Fuck them all.

505
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,857
- Do I look like I'm afraid?
- No.

506
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,891
Do you understand me? Do you?

507
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:14,136
Lou, what's going on?

508
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,454
We're here.

509
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,489
How many?

510
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:21,218
We're doing a deal in the next room.

511
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,134
When do you make the trade?

512
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:29,576
- Ten minutes.
- Ten minutes?

513
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:33,936
- Don't trust those yellow dogs.
- I don't trust anyone.

514
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:41,857
Lou?

515
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:44,175
Talk to me, you motherfucker.

516
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:46,176
Or I'll kill you myself.

517
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:02,571
The consequences can kiss my black ass.

518
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:31,650
This has become a large problem, Avi.

519
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:35,572
There's no such thing as problems, Mr. Green,

520
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:38,373
only situations.

521
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:02,897
Wake up, Mr. Green.

522
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:10,171
Checkmate.

523
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:15,011
How?

524
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:17,051
How what?

525
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,375
We've kept you alive, now you can tell me.

526
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,297
How do you keep winning?

527
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:23,331
It's very simple.

528
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:26,850
You do all the hard work, I just help you along.

529
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,569
The art is for me to feed pieces to you

530
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:37,978
and make you believe you took those pieces,
because you are smarter and I am dumber.

531
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:43,333
In every game and con there is always
an opponent and there is always a victim.

532
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:46,178
The more control the victim thinks he has,

533
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:49,131
the less control he actually has.

534
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:51,171
Gradually he will hang himself.

535
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:53,939
I, as the opponent, just help him along.

536
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:57,777
Is that the treasured formula?

537
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:00,971
The formula has infinite depth
in its efficacy and application,

538
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:04,729
but it is staggeringly simple
and completely consistent.

539
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:09,979
Rule one of any game or con: You can only
get smarter by playing a smarter opponent.

540
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:11,339
Rule number two.

541
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:15,931
The more sophisticated the game,
the more sophisticated the opponent.

542
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:19,210
If the opponent is very good,

543
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:22,809
he will place his victim
inside an environment he can control.

544
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:25,499
The bigger the environment,
the easier the control.

545
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:30,216
Toss the dog a bone, find their weakness,

546
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:33,172
and give them just a little
of what they think they want.

547
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,208
Check.

548
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:39,979
So the opponent simply distracts their victim

549
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:43,137
by getting them consumed
with their own consumption.

550
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:48,898
Check.

551
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:52,454
The word "snake" springs to mind.

552
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:56,288
Don't knock it.
You only get smarter by playing a snake.

553
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:02,217
The bigger the trick and older the trick,
the easier it is to pull.

554
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:05,058
Based on two principles.

555
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:08,331
They think it can't be that old
and they think it can't be that big,

556
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,257
for so many people to have fallen for it.

557
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:16,975
Eventually,
when the opponent is challenged or questioned,

558
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:22,299
it means the victim's investment
and thus his intelligence is questioned.

559
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:25,331
No-one can accept that,

560
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,371
not even to themselves.

561
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:33,331
Checkmate.

562
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:36,814
I ain't playing you again.

563
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:40,819
You'll always find a good opponent
in the very last place you would ever look.

564
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:44,978
You've got more tricks than a clown's pocket,
don't you, Mr. Green?

565
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:59,777
Everything all right?

566
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,339
Can they hear you?

567
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:13,450
Two minutes.

568
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:17,571
You're OK.

569
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:19,611
Get out, Jake, as soon as you can.

570
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:22,220
I had to dig very deep
to find someone who'd talk.

571
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,251
They're the last resort.

572
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:30,330
They're the last resort. When no other
loan sharks will lend them, your boys move in.

573
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:34,258
They stepped on Gold's toes
and he wouldn't touch 'em.

574
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:35,779
Gold?

575
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:39,176
Yes, the Gold, Sam Gold.

576
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:41,529
Mr. Clandestine.

577
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,696
Mr. Ambiguous.

578
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,696
Mr. Mystery.

579
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:49,653
Get out of there.

580
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:53,257
Get out of there, Jake.

581
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:57,418
No-one lives and displeases Gold.

582
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:59,098
No-one but your two friends.

583
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:02,018
Got to be something wrong with 'em
if Gold won't touch 'em.

584
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:05,132
Got to be something wrong
if the Goldfather won't touch 'em.

585
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:07,296
No-one sees Gold,

586
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:09,456
but Gold sees everything.

587
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:15,051
The smoke signals say,
"Dodge 'em like an angry bullet."

588
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:18,410
Tell your friend to get out of there.

589
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:20,849
Jake, get out of there.

590
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:22,174
Get out of there.

591
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:24,495
Get out of there.

592
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:37,330
Tomorrow.

593
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,491
You're worse than a stuck record.

594
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:48,134
"Tomorrow, tomorrow."

595
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:50,136
Tomorrow is never going to come, is it?

596
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:51,579
Hello, it's warming up.

597
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:54,578
Zach, kick him, see if that jogs him on.

598
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:56,451
You want me to play mother?

599
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:59,060
I took care of Horowitz. It's your turn.

600
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:06,809
Change of plan.

601
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,578
I can see what's coming.

602
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:10,258
Give it to Mr. Green.

603
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:18,694
Mr. Green.

604
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:20,059
Shoot Fred for me.

605
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:25,898
Not dead, stupid, just in the back of the knee.

606
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:28,170
I ain't shooting Fred, Zach.

607
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:32,452
Sometimes, a little voice
tells you to think about number one.

608
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,092
Told you, Avi.

609
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:38,530
Never had the gumption,
never going to have what it takes.

610
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:40,736
It's easier than you think.

611
00:52:40,771 --> 00:52:42,892
It's one little squeeze,

612
00:52:42,932 --> 00:52:45,492
just like a tube of toothpaste.

613
00:52:45,532 --> 00:52:47,363
Who the fuck are you two?

614
00:52:47,412 --> 00:52:49,846
You can't see what's right in front of you.

615
00:52:49,892 --> 00:52:56,650
You're supposed to be stiff, cold and horizontal,
and you still don't trust us?

616
00:52:57,692 --> 00:53:00,889
Shoot him in the kneecap.
The debt has to be paid.

617
00:53:01,932 --> 00:53:05,288
And sometimes it's best to listen to it.

618
00:53:06,492 --> 00:53:08,483
Get your arse up, Fred.

619
00:53:10,972 --> 00:53:12,405
Go on. Get out.

620
00:53:15,212 --> 00:53:17,567
He can't do that, Jake.

621
00:53:17,612 --> 00:53:19,091
Then why don't you stop him, Avi?

622
00:53:19,132 --> 00:53:22,010
What the fuck do you know?
Shoot that toad now.

623
00:53:26,332 --> 00:53:27,890
One more step, Avi.

624
00:53:29,532 --> 00:53:31,363
Just like a squeeze of toothpaste.

625
00:53:33,412 --> 00:53:36,085
You realize what you're doing, Mr. Green?

626
00:53:36,132 --> 00:53:41,604
Hold on, Jake. This isn't the plan.
This won't have a happy ending.

627
00:53:43,052 --> 00:53:44,610
One more step, Avi.

628
00:54:00,132 --> 00:54:02,088
Wake up, Mr. Green.

629
00:54:38,772 --> 00:54:42,651
Congratulations, Mr. Green.
It's past the third day and you have risen.

630
00:54:42,692 --> 00:54:44,683
I think you're due for a check-up.

631
00:54:51,492 --> 00:54:53,289
Did the bad guys get you?

632
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:55,323
There's no such thing as "bad guys", Rachel.

633
00:54:55,372 --> 00:54:58,330
Yes, there are.
That's why Daddy's friends are looking after us.

634
00:54:58,372 --> 00:55:03,162
Never mind about that. Why don't you be a
good girl and get your Uncle Jake a cold drink?

635
00:55:13,332 --> 00:55:15,323
It's a bit of a mess, isn't it?

636
00:55:15,372 --> 00:55:17,408
Things will sort themselves out.

637
00:55:17,452 --> 00:55:19,443
Is she all right?

638
00:55:19,492 --> 00:55:22,643
Don't you worry about her.
You just look after yourself.

639
00:55:26,212 --> 00:55:28,885
Mr. Green, I don't know how to tell you this.

640
00:55:28,932 --> 00:55:32,641
Our first results,
they must have been wrong.

641
00:55:37,212 --> 00:55:39,521
I cannot apologize enough for this error.

642
00:55:39,572 --> 00:55:43,167
You're not a well man, but...

643
00:56:03,092 --> 00:56:05,208
We have to assess our clients very carefully.

644
00:56:12,972 --> 00:56:17,409
There is something about yourself
that you don't know.

645
00:56:17,452 --> 00:56:21,411
Something that you will deny even exists

646
00:56:21,452 --> 00:56:25,604
until it's too late to do anything about it.

647
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:34,721
It's the only reason you get up in the morning,

648
00:56:34,772 --> 00:56:38,162
the only reason you suffer the shitty boss,

649
00:56:38,212 --> 00:56:40,931
the blood, the sweat and the tears.

650
00:56:41,972 --> 00:56:44,247
This is because you want people to know

651
00:56:44,292 --> 00:56:50,242
how good, attractive, generous, funny,
wild and clever you really are.

652
00:56:50,292 --> 00:56:54,490
"Fear or revere me,
but please think I'm special."

653
00:56:55,532 --> 00:56:57,807
We share an addiction.

654
00:56:57,852 --> 00:57:00,002
We're approval junkies.

655
00:57:00,892 --> 00:57:03,247
We're all in it for the slap on the back

656
00:57:03,292 --> 00:57:05,283
and the gold watch.

657
00:57:05,332 --> 00:57:08,324
The "hip, hip, hoo-fucking-rah."

658
00:57:08,372 --> 00:57:12,604
Look at the clever boy
with the badge, polishing his trophy.

659
00:57:12,652 --> 00:57:16,008
Shine on, you crazy diamond.

660
00:57:16,052 --> 00:57:19,840
Cos we're just monkeys wrapped in suits,

661
00:57:19,892 --> 00:57:23,567
begging for the approval of others.

662
00:57:25,652 --> 00:57:28,610
If we knew this, we wouldn't do this.

663
00:57:28,652 --> 00:57:31,086
Someone is hiding it from us.

664
00:57:32,132 --> 00:57:36,171
And if you had a second chance,
you would ask...

665
00:57:36,212 --> 00:57:37,406
Why?

666
00:57:37,452 --> 00:57:39,443
- Why what?
- Why am I still alive?

667
00:57:39,492 --> 00:57:42,086
Why did you give my money away?

668
00:57:42,132 --> 00:57:44,123
Why didn't you want 'em to know?

669
00:57:45,332 --> 00:57:47,562
Why didn't you want me to know?

670
00:57:47,612 --> 00:57:49,523
You'll find out soon enough.

671
00:57:52,972 --> 00:57:54,963
Whilst I've been digging around on Lord John

672
00:57:55,012 --> 00:57:58,004
I came across a couple
of cash-talking shit-sniffers

673
00:57:58,052 --> 00:57:59,644
who came up with the name...

674
00:57:59,692 --> 00:58:01,284
Green.

675
00:58:01,332 --> 00:58:03,288
That's right, Jake Green.

676
00:58:03,332 --> 00:58:05,846
- Go on.
- I'm working for his brother.

677
00:58:05,892 --> 00:58:06,802
Patrick.

678
00:58:06,852 --> 00:58:11,562
A couple of opportunists, looking after
his older brother, got a little bit greedy.

679
00:58:11,612 --> 00:58:12,886
Want to impress you.

680
00:58:12,932 --> 00:58:17,448
All right, you take Sorter and Slim Biggins
and enough men to avoid an excuse.

681
00:58:20,852 --> 00:58:23,241
It's about fucking time.

682
00:58:26,132 --> 00:58:28,441
Now that is a picture.

683
00:58:29,492 --> 00:58:32,325
You took your sweet-ass time.
I was starting to get bored.

684
00:58:32,372 --> 00:58:34,408
You should have kept busy with a swim.

685
00:58:34,452 --> 00:58:38,161
Funny you should say that.
Zach's quite a swimmer, aren't you, Zach?

686
00:58:38,212 --> 00:58:40,328
20 lengths in ten seconds.

687
00:58:40,372 --> 00:58:45,241
We thought it might be a record. You want
to try to beat it? Come on in and join us.

688
00:58:45,292 --> 00:58:49,046
I'll just pop upstairs, grab my trunks,
and be down in a jiffy.

689
00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:52,209
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- Oh, and why is that, Avi?

690
00:58:52,252 --> 00:58:54,163
Why do you think we're in this icy birdbath,

691
00:58:54,212 --> 00:58:57,488
when we could be upstairs, toasty
and cozy, watching the naughty channel?

692
00:59:00,012 --> 00:59:03,925
How long can it take to get five coffees
and a couple of pizzas?

693
00:59:09,572 --> 00:59:11,881
You are on your own, Jakey boy.

694
00:59:16,812 --> 00:59:18,291
Move.

695
00:59:59,932 --> 01:00:01,968
You've got to tell the boss.

696
01:00:02,012 --> 01:00:04,003
Why me?

697
01:00:04,052 --> 01:00:06,282
Because you're the one who ordered the pizza.

698
01:00:19,092 --> 01:00:21,811
This time you're going to tell me what's going on.

699
01:00:21,852 --> 01:00:23,843
Two sugars, am I right?

700
01:00:23,892 --> 01:00:25,530
Forget the tea, Avi.

701
01:00:26,572 --> 01:00:28,563
Thank you, Jenny, that will be all.

702
01:00:31,292 --> 01:00:35,331
You didn't tell us the truth
about the three Eddies did you, Mr. Green?

703
01:00:35,372 --> 01:00:37,408
The Eddies upset Macha in some way

704
01:00:37,452 --> 01:00:41,525
so he had them used as aggregate, and mixed
into some concrete on one of his buildings.

705
01:00:46,212 --> 01:00:49,329
Would you like us to remind you
of what really happened?

706
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:54,162
The Eddies were waiting for you
when you got out of prison.

707
01:00:54,212 --> 01:00:56,168
It was Macha's fault.

708
01:00:56,212 --> 01:00:58,521
They didn't work for him any more,
and wanted to...

709
01:00:58,572 --> 01:00:59,687
...compensate you.

710
01:00:59,732 --> 01:01:01,688
What they really meant was they wanted...

711
01:01:01,732 --> 01:01:05,611
...to put 12 grams of angry lead
in the back of your fucking head.

712
01:01:05,652 --> 01:01:08,405
But you gave them an offer they couldn't refuse.

713
01:01:08,452 --> 01:01:10,568
No-one kills a man
who's going to make 'em money.

714
01:01:10,612 --> 01:01:14,525
So you would give them 3% a month
on any money they would lend you.

715
01:01:14,572 --> 01:01:19,248
You needed the money quickly for some small
but profitable deal that you'd made on the inside.

716
01:01:19,292 --> 01:01:24,127
In fact, it was more profitable than any rate
they can get anywhere, legal or illegal.

717
01:01:24,172 --> 01:01:26,242
- So, one of them said...
- I'm in.

718
01:01:26,292 --> 01:01:29,807
- A month later he got his money back.
- Plus your 3%.

719
01:01:30,852 --> 01:01:34,162
- Now, nobody kills a man...
...who's going to make him money.

720
01:01:34,212 --> 01:01:37,090
- They always protect their investment.
- I can give you 4% a month.

721
01:01:37,132 --> 01:01:39,930
- You know this is just between us?
- That's right, Eddie.

722
01:01:39,972 --> 01:01:42,406
Next deal - this time they're all in.

723
01:01:42,452 --> 01:01:44,443
I give you 4% a month.

724
01:01:45,532 --> 01:01:49,491
For two years you always came through,
regular like clockwork.

725
01:01:49,532 --> 01:01:51,250
But there was no deal.

726
01:01:51,292 --> 01:01:55,444
You would take money off of one Eddie
and repay the other Eddie, plus the 4%.

727
01:01:55,492 --> 01:01:57,562
Plus your 4%. On top.

728
01:01:57,612 --> 01:02:01,491
You were not greedy, you did it nice and slow.

729
01:02:01,532 --> 01:02:03,204
You were paying for their trust.

730
01:02:03,252 --> 01:02:06,324
- This is just between us, right, Jake?
- That's right, Eddie.

731
01:02:06,372 --> 01:02:10,524
It was the easiest money they'd known. Soon
they couldn't give you their money fast enough.

732
01:02:10,572 --> 01:02:13,291
A few months later they didn't
have enough of their own to lend,

733
01:02:13,332 --> 01:02:15,527
so they started to borrow money off Macha.

734
01:02:15,572 --> 01:02:17,244
- 3%?
- Plus your 3%.

735
01:02:17,292 --> 01:02:19,567
- 4%?
- Plus your 4%.

736
01:02:20,812 --> 01:02:22,530
5%?

737
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:24,085
Macha became interested.

738
01:02:24,132 --> 01:02:26,521
How could the Eddies
have such a good little earner?

739
01:02:26,572 --> 01:02:30,565
- They hid you like a dirty little secret.
- Find out who's behind this.

740
01:02:30,612 --> 01:02:31,806
Who's behind this?

741
01:02:33,052 --> 01:02:35,771
Ask no questions, hear no lies.

742
01:02:35,812 --> 01:02:38,929
- They tell anything but the truth.
- Find out if Green is behind this.

743
01:02:38,972 --> 01:02:43,170
- Is Jake Green behind this?
- I'll tell you, no, it's not Jake Green.

744
01:02:43,212 --> 01:02:47,444
- They'd do anything to protect their investment.
- I'm not sharing the golden goose.

745
01:02:47,492 --> 01:02:50,689
But Macha got his interest,
so he kept loaning them more and more.

746
01:02:50,732 --> 01:02:52,484
Lend them the money.

747
01:02:52,532 --> 01:02:56,445
You were back gambling, making more money
than you knew what to do with. You were rich.

748
01:02:56,492 --> 01:02:58,483
I am rich.

749
01:02:58,532 --> 01:03:00,329
Seriously fucking rich.

750
01:03:00,372 --> 01:03:04,285
After a year, you had enough of the Eddies'
money, or should I say Macha's money...

751
01:03:04,332 --> 01:03:08,962
- Now I'm richer. A lot fucking richer.
...to buy a chain of hotels.

752
01:03:09,012 --> 01:03:11,367
So you went on a discreet three-month holiday.

753
01:03:11,412 --> 01:03:15,246
You took your brother, his daughter,
Macha's money and you enjoyed yourself.

754
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:19,080
A bit of the old sun, sand, sea and sausages.

755
01:03:19,132 --> 01:03:22,044
The Eddies meanwhile
were having a terminal argument...

756
01:03:23,092 --> 01:03:27,131
...about how they were going to pay back Macha
that obscene amount of cash they owed him.

757
01:03:27,172 --> 01:03:29,367
I want my money back, Paul.

758
01:03:32,732 --> 01:03:36,964
Those boys really suffered, Jake. The more
they told the truth, the more they suffered.

759
01:03:39,452 --> 01:03:42,364
- It's Jake Green.
- He's telling the fucking truth.

760
01:03:43,332 --> 01:03:46,165
They told me that story already.
Give me the truth.

761
01:03:47,172 --> 01:03:49,606
You gave them just enough rope
to hang themselves.

762
01:03:53,932 --> 01:03:55,923
You're a good little conman, Jake.

763
01:03:55,972 --> 01:04:02,491
And you think you're smart, and you are,
just not as smart as you think you are.

764
01:04:09,092 --> 01:04:11,083
Elvis. Come here.

765
01:04:13,172 --> 01:04:16,289
If I wanted vinegar,
I would have ordered French fries.

766
01:04:17,332 --> 01:04:20,404
Get me something with a price tag on it.

767
01:04:22,372 --> 01:04:25,250
...Mr. Green. What did he do, anyway?

768
01:04:26,852 --> 01:04:28,843
Hamish?

769
01:04:32,812 --> 01:04:36,327
It's OK, we're among friends.
Come on, what have you got for me?

770
01:04:39,052 --> 01:04:40,849
What am I going to tell him?

771
01:04:40,892 --> 01:04:44,407
That's your problem, but it had better be good.

772
01:04:46,372 --> 01:04:48,363
I turned up to pick them up...

773
01:05:01,412 --> 01:05:03,528
...and that is what I saw.

774
01:05:07,532 --> 01:05:09,523
That's a fascinating story.

775
01:05:10,932 --> 01:05:12,923
I have one question for you.

776
01:05:14,532 --> 01:05:16,648
How?

777
01:05:16,692 --> 01:05:18,444
How what?

778
01:05:18,492 --> 01:05:20,483
"How what?"

779
01:05:20,532 --> 01:05:22,523
There were six of us,

780
01:05:22,572 --> 01:05:25,211
plus Slim Biggins, who counts as another six.

781
01:05:25,252 --> 01:05:27,129
How many were there of him?

782
01:05:29,412 --> 01:05:31,528
- One.
- One.

783
01:05:32,972 --> 01:05:38,410
So, how exactly did this "one"
manage to disarm and overpower

784
01:05:38,452 --> 01:05:41,808
a four-time national body-building champion,

785
01:05:44,572 --> 01:05:51,205
drag him half a block, throw him over a six-foot
wall and then get him to eat his own gun?

786
01:05:56,772 --> 01:05:58,444
Get down, boss.

787
01:05:59,332 --> 01:06:01,323
Just find the gunman.

788
01:06:02,572 --> 01:06:04,688
Don't fucking move.

789
01:06:04,732 --> 01:06:06,529
Lou. Lou.

790
01:06:07,812 --> 01:06:10,246
- Keep the boss down.
- What the fuck's going on?

791
01:06:13,012 --> 01:06:14,843
I don't know.

792
01:06:14,892 --> 01:06:17,201
Sorter just shot the...

793
01:06:19,412 --> 01:06:21,482
...and he went in the kitchen.

794
01:06:21,532 --> 01:06:24,046
- Nobody fucking move.
- Bastard.

795
01:06:31,412 --> 01:06:33,243
Keep the fucking boss down.

796
01:08:50,092 --> 01:08:52,208
She shot my finger off.

797
01:08:52,252 --> 01:08:54,129
The bitch shot my finger off.

798
01:09:03,652 --> 01:09:05,643
Who is it?

799
01:09:10,292 --> 01:09:11,725
Happy Tony, Lord John's man.

800
01:09:12,772 --> 01:09:15,605
Not looking so happy now, is he?

801
01:09:20,372 --> 01:09:22,090
Check she's dead, Lou.

802
01:09:22,932 --> 01:09:24,968
Greed gets them all in the end.

803
01:09:30,052 --> 01:09:32,088
Now, shoot straight, Sorter.

804
01:09:32,132 --> 01:09:34,771
Glad to see you've got those feelings in check.

805
01:09:41,932 --> 01:09:46,960
Find a couple of Lord John's boys and
persuade them to tell you where my powder is.

806
01:11:16,332 --> 01:11:19,130
What is the first rule of any game, Mr. Green?

807
01:11:21,132 --> 01:11:24,727
The only way to get smarter
is by playing a smarter opponent.

808
01:11:24,772 --> 01:11:27,366
What's rule two of any game?

809
01:11:27,412 --> 01:11:31,166
The more sophisticated the game,
the more sophisticated the opponent.

810
01:11:32,212 --> 01:11:34,806
Almost the same,
but where does it stop, Mr. Green?

811
01:11:35,852 --> 01:11:38,082
Where does this game stop?

812
01:11:38,132 --> 01:11:40,851
It stops when you start to give me answers.

813
01:11:40,892 --> 01:11:43,201
Don't let them play head games with you, Jake.

814
01:11:43,252 --> 01:11:45,925
Is it me that's playing head games with you,
Mr. Green?

815
01:11:53,332 --> 01:11:56,483
You've heard their voice for so long,
you believe it to be you.

816
01:11:58,412 --> 01:12:00,972
You believe it to be your best friend.

817
01:12:01,572 --> 01:12:04,723
They should believe
their opponent to be their best friend.

818
01:12:04,772 --> 01:12:07,366
Where's the best place
an opponent should hide?

819
01:12:09,052 --> 01:12:11,930
In the very last place you would ever look.

820
01:12:11,972 --> 01:12:15,567
Do you know who Sam Gold is, Mr. Green?

821
01:12:15,612 --> 01:12:17,603
You should,

822
01:12:17,652 --> 01:12:20,325
because he knows who you are.

823
01:12:20,372 --> 01:12:22,169
The Gold,

824
01:12:22,212 --> 01:12:24,009
Sam Gold.

825
01:12:24,052 --> 01:12:25,724
Mr. Clandestine.

826
01:12:25,772 --> 01:12:27,569
Mr. Ambiguous.

827
01:12:27,612 --> 01:12:29,921
Mr. Mystery.

828
01:12:29,972 --> 01:12:31,963
He's all up here,

829
01:12:33,012 --> 01:12:34,923
pretending to be you.

830
01:12:34,972 --> 01:12:37,327
No-one sees Gold,

831
01:12:37,372 --> 01:12:39,681
but Gold sees everything.

832
01:12:39,732 --> 01:12:41,723
You're in a game, Jake.

833
01:12:41,772 --> 01:12:43,763
You're in the game.

834
01:12:44,812 --> 01:12:46,803
Everyone's in his game,

835
01:12:46,852 --> 01:12:48,843
and nobody knows it.

836
01:12:48,892 --> 01:12:52,965
And all of this, this is his world.

837
01:12:53,012 --> 01:12:54,445
He owns it.

838
01:12:55,492 --> 01:12:57,687
He controls it.

839
01:12:57,732 --> 01:13:00,724
I've had enough of this shit.
Tell him you've had enough.

840
01:13:00,772 --> 01:13:02,364
He tells you what to do...

841
01:13:02,412 --> 01:13:04,880
- Look, that's enough.
...and when to do it.

842
01:13:04,932 --> 01:13:08,129
- Tell him.
- I said that's enough, Avi.

843
01:13:08,172 --> 01:13:12,245
Eventually, when the opponent
is challenged or questioned,

844
01:13:12,292 --> 01:13:16,570
it means the victim's investment
and thus his intelligence is questioned.

845
01:13:17,572 --> 01:13:19,290
No-one can accept that,

846
01:13:20,332 --> 01:13:22,368
not even to themselves.

847
01:13:24,812 --> 01:13:27,690
He's behind all the pain there ever was.

848
01:13:29,812 --> 01:13:32,929
Behind every crime ever committed.

849
01:13:38,292 --> 01:13:44,731
How can I be behind all the pain,
all the crime, if I don't even exist?

850
01:13:44,772 --> 01:13:50,847
And right now,
he's telling you that he doesn't even exist.

851
01:13:53,172 --> 01:13:57,450
No-one lives and displeases Gold.

852
01:13:57,492 --> 01:13:59,403
No-one but your two friends.

853
01:14:00,452 --> 01:14:04,047
We just put you to war
with the only enemy that ever existed,

854
01:14:04,092 --> 01:14:07,129
and you, you think he's your best friend.

855
01:14:07,172 --> 01:14:11,882
And they will protect their best friend
with everything they've got.

856
01:14:12,932 --> 01:14:15,810
You're protecting him, Mr. Green,

857
01:14:17,932 --> 01:14:19,923
but with what?

858
01:14:19,972 --> 01:14:22,884
Where's the best place
an opponent should hide?

859
01:14:25,292 --> 01:14:27,408
In the very last place you'd ever look.

860
01:14:27,452 --> 01:14:30,410
He's hiding behind your pain, Jake.

861
01:14:34,932 --> 01:14:37,048
You're protecting him with your pain.

862
01:14:38,052 --> 01:14:43,046
Embrace the pain and you will win this game.

863
01:14:45,252 --> 01:14:50,770
And I know nothing hurts more
than humiliation and a little money loss.

864
01:14:50,812 --> 01:14:54,043
If you change the rules on what controls you...

865
01:14:54,092 --> 01:14:58,005
...you will change the rules
on what you can control.

866
01:14:59,012 --> 01:15:02,368
How radical are you prepared to be, Mr. Green?

867
01:15:25,532 --> 01:15:28,888
The more power
you think you have in Gold's world,

868
01:15:28,932 --> 01:15:31,890
the less power you have in the real world.

869
01:15:34,572 --> 01:15:36,563
You are still in prison, Jake.

870
01:15:36,612 --> 01:15:39,604
In fact, you never left.

871
01:15:39,652 --> 01:15:43,850
Remember who they are, Jake.
Head tricksters, word slicksters.

872
01:15:43,892 --> 01:15:46,406
You wanted answers and they gave you riddles.

873
01:15:46,452 --> 01:15:49,922
You know the rules,
the longer you listened, the sweeter the pitch.

874
01:15:49,972 --> 01:15:53,044
He's got all the tricks and all the right answers.

875
01:15:54,372 --> 01:15:58,888
Don't let them do this to you, Jake.
Don't let them turn you against you.

876
01:16:01,772 --> 01:16:05,651
You don't give because it's good.
You give because it hurts him.

877
01:16:26,212 --> 01:16:28,203
What are we doing here?

878
01:16:29,212 --> 01:16:31,806
He's the enemy, Jake, not me.

879
01:16:31,852 --> 01:16:35,686
Use your perceived enemy
to destroy your real enemy.

880
01:16:35,732 --> 01:16:39,247
Do not listen, Jake.
You've got a gun. Use it.

881
01:16:40,652 --> 01:16:42,608
Don't wake him up. Suffocate him.

882
01:16:42,652 --> 01:16:45,644
Put the pillow over his head and suffocate him.

883
01:16:45,692 --> 01:16:48,331
He'd do it to you, Jake.

884
01:16:48,372 --> 01:16:51,091
If you can't do it, then you're not a free man.

885
01:16:51,132 --> 01:16:53,407
You are controlled.

886
01:16:53,452 --> 01:16:55,966
"Controlled? Free man?"

887
01:16:56,012 --> 01:16:58,367
Jake, wake up.

888
01:17:07,132 --> 01:17:11,523
Look, Mr. Macha, I'm very sorry
to have woken you. Please listen to me.

889
01:17:13,732 --> 01:17:16,246
Who's that? Mr. Green?

890
01:17:16,292 --> 01:17:20,604
Mr. Macha, please, I'm sorry to have woken you.
Listen to me.

891
01:17:20,652 --> 01:17:22,961
"Sorry." Listen at how you sound.

892
01:17:24,332 --> 01:17:26,084
I came to apologize.

893
01:17:26,132 --> 01:17:30,011
Forgive me for the things I've said
and for cheating you out of your money.

894
01:17:30,052 --> 01:17:31,804
I couldn't think clearly.

895
01:17:31,852 --> 01:17:34,047
- Shut up.
- No, no, that's too much.

896
01:17:34,092 --> 01:17:38,085
Shoot the fucker. Shoot him.
He's been trying to kill you.

897
01:17:38,132 --> 01:17:41,124
He killed your friend, shot like a fucking dog.

898
01:17:42,172 --> 01:17:45,801
That's better, Jake, in control again.
Do the right thing.

899
01:17:45,852 --> 01:17:48,730
Take care of your enemy, take care of business.

900
01:17:48,772 --> 01:17:53,288
Use any means possible
to induce head pain, and engage the enemy.

901
01:17:53,332 --> 01:17:55,129
Shut up.

902
01:17:55,172 --> 01:17:58,005
Wake up, Jake.
What are you fucking doing?

903
01:17:58,052 --> 01:18:00,043
Leave it.

904
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:02,083
You're groveling.

905
01:18:02,132 --> 01:18:05,363
I now realize you're a man
to be feared and respected.

906
01:18:09,052 --> 01:18:11,964
I now realize you're a man
to be feared and respected.

907
01:18:12,012 --> 01:18:13,843
Stop groveling.

908
01:18:15,732 --> 01:18:17,723
Where's your pride?

909
01:18:24,292 --> 01:18:25,566
Where's your pride?

910
01:18:25,612 --> 01:18:28,410
I made a big mistake, Mr. Macha.
Shut up.

911
01:18:28,452 --> 01:18:31,489
I underestimated your power and your intellect.

912
01:18:31,532 --> 01:18:35,081
I've made a donation in your name
as a peace offering,

913
01:18:36,132 --> 01:18:38,327
as a token of my apology.

914
01:18:39,972 --> 01:18:42,327
I want you to...

915
01:18:42,372 --> 01:18:44,363
Shut up.

916
01:18:44,412 --> 01:18:46,243
I want you to forgive my stupidity.

917
01:19:08,132 --> 01:19:12,762
Wherever you don't want to go
is where you will find him.

918
01:19:14,812 --> 01:19:17,770
What is it that you are afraid of, Mr. Green?

919
01:20:01,132 --> 01:20:03,726
Why are you doing this to yourself, Jake?

920
01:20:03,772 --> 01:20:05,763
It's too tight, Jake.

921
01:20:06,812 --> 01:20:08,803
We've got to get out.

922
01:20:09,812 --> 01:20:12,087
You're going to die in a tiny space, Jake.

923
01:20:16,772 --> 01:20:18,763
Have to get out.

924
01:20:21,812 --> 01:20:23,609
We're stuck, stuck.

925
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:25,643
The walls are moving in.

926
01:20:27,332 --> 01:20:29,323
It's tight. I'm scared.

927
01:20:29,372 --> 01:20:32,330
We've got to get out. I can hear you.

928
01:20:36,332 --> 01:20:38,129
I can hear you.

929
01:20:38,172 --> 01:20:39,161
What?

930
01:20:39,212 --> 01:20:41,487
I can hear you.

931
01:20:41,532 --> 01:20:43,727
I'm onto you.

932
01:20:50,332 --> 01:20:53,051
Who takes care of the good times?

933
01:20:53,092 --> 01:20:55,731
- We're a team.
- We're best pals, Jake.

934
01:20:55,772 --> 01:20:59,765
- You want to get rid of me?
- Do you know life without me?

935
01:20:59,812 --> 01:21:03,487
- No. Because it doesn't...
...exist.

936
01:21:03,532 --> 01:21:05,284
- Do they talk about me, Jake?
- No.

937
01:21:05,332 --> 01:21:07,323
Because I don't exist.

938
01:21:07,372 --> 01:21:11,490
- Tell all your friends about me then, Jake?
- I protect you and I control you.

939
01:21:11,532 --> 01:21:13,523
I say do, you obey.

940
01:21:13,572 --> 01:21:16,325
- If I say you're scared...
...you're scared.

941
01:21:16,372 --> 01:21:19,364
You've been listening to the other side,
haven't you, Jake?

942
01:21:19,412 --> 01:21:22,404
- Listening to people who want to hurt you.
- New people. New.

943
01:21:22,452 --> 01:21:24,443
Not old friends like me.

944
01:21:24,492 --> 01:21:28,929
People you shouldn't trust. Not me. I've been
your friend forever, since the beginning.

945
01:21:28,972 --> 01:21:31,964
Get rid of them, Jake, forever.
They're the enemy, not me.

946
01:21:32,012 --> 01:21:35,049
They're new, I'm old. I stay, they go.

947
01:21:35,092 --> 01:21:37,526
I say you do.

948
01:21:37,572 --> 01:21:38,641
You do.

949
01:21:38,692 --> 01:21:40,683
You're weak without me, weak.

950
01:21:40,732 --> 01:21:42,450
It's us against them, Jake.

951
01:21:42,492 --> 01:21:44,926
It's us against them.

952
01:21:44,972 --> 01:21:47,281
I'm coming to get you.

953
01:21:47,332 --> 01:21:49,971
You want to get rid of me?
You want to make an enemy out of me?

954
01:21:50,012 --> 01:21:52,082
You want to get rid of me, do you?

955
01:21:52,132 --> 01:21:53,645
Do you?

956
01:21:53,692 --> 01:21:56,126
You want to get rid of me, me, me, me?

957
01:22:10,852 --> 01:22:13,366
Still here, Jake?

958
01:22:13,412 --> 01:22:16,722
How long have I looked after you?

959
01:22:16,772 --> 01:22:18,842
You can't win this one without me.

960
01:22:20,452 --> 01:22:22,966
You know why?

961
01:22:24,012 --> 01:22:26,003
I am you.

962
01:22:29,052 --> 01:22:31,043
You ain't me.

963
01:22:32,332 --> 01:22:40,808
The greatest con that he ever pulled,
was making you believe that he is you.

964
01:22:42,132 --> 01:22:44,327
You ain't me.

965
01:22:44,372 --> 01:22:47,569
- I am you.
- You're not me.

966
01:22:47,612 --> 01:22:49,091
Come on.

967
01:22:52,092 --> 01:22:54,242
Your best fucking friend.

968
01:22:58,012 --> 01:23:00,367
I am you.

969
01:23:09,732 --> 01:23:11,723
You don't control me.

970
01:23:12,692 --> 01:23:14,444
I control you.

971
01:23:45,732 --> 01:23:50,089
You come to my house with a loaded gun.

972
01:23:51,332 --> 01:23:55,450
You speak to me like I'm a fucking idiot.

973
01:23:56,892 --> 01:23:58,883
What's your game?

974
01:24:00,332 --> 01:24:02,323
What's your game?

975
01:24:03,732 --> 01:24:05,723
Speak to me.

976
01:24:07,412 --> 01:24:09,403
Speak to me.

977
01:24:09,452 --> 01:24:12,967
Or I'll kill you like the fucking dog that you are.

978
01:24:19,532 --> 01:24:21,523
Fear me.

979
01:24:32,332 --> 01:24:34,482
Fear me.

980
01:25:35,332 --> 01:25:38,722
We have already killed Lord John
and two of your colleagues.

981
01:25:38,772 --> 01:25:42,560
If you value your life
more than a few bags of white powder,

982
01:25:42,612 --> 01:25:44,603
you will tell me...

983
01:25:44,652 --> 01:25:46,608
where it is hidden.

984
01:26:11,692 --> 01:26:13,683
Is everything all right, Mr. D?

985
01:26:14,732 --> 01:26:17,530
It will be when you take care
of my security, Paul.

986
01:26:18,652 --> 01:26:20,643
What are you holding the papers for?

987
01:26:21,692 --> 01:26:24,525
Because you're on the cover of half of them.

988
01:26:26,172 --> 01:26:29,562
If you don't mind me asking,
what has come over you, Mr. D?

989
01:26:34,052 --> 01:26:36,043
They think you did it.

990
01:26:40,012 --> 01:26:43,368
Oh, my god.
Take the credit, they'll never know.

991
01:26:44,412 --> 01:26:46,767
This feels good.

992
01:26:53,212 --> 01:26:55,203
This feels quite good.

993
01:26:55,252 --> 01:26:57,447
I'm going to take the credit.

994
01:26:58,492 --> 01:27:00,687
It might come as a surprise to you, Paul,

995
01:27:03,212 --> 01:27:05,203
but I do have a heart.

996
01:27:08,732 --> 01:27:11,121
I have some news about Green.

997
01:27:11,172 --> 01:27:13,561
I'll give you news about Green.

998
01:27:13,612 --> 01:27:16,604
He now knows who's boss.

999
01:27:16,652 --> 01:27:20,486
He was sniveling like a baby
begging for forgiveness.

1000
01:27:20,532 --> 01:27:24,571
It was embarrassing. We're not going to
be hearing from Mr. Green for a while.

1001
01:27:24,612 --> 01:27:27,604
I'm not sure if that's the case, Mr. D.

1002
01:27:28,652 --> 01:27:31,246
Whilst you've been sleeping, we've been busy.

1003
01:27:31,292 --> 01:27:36,810
If Lord John's boys know where the powder is,
they took it to the grave.

1004
01:27:36,852 --> 01:27:39,412
We know Green's behind everything.

1005
01:27:39,452 --> 01:27:42,205
He took your powder, not Lord John.

1006
01:27:42,252 --> 01:27:46,803
He's been playing games with us,
and he's been playing games with you.

1007
01:27:46,852 --> 01:27:48,968
Fear me. Fear me.

1008
01:27:49,012 --> 01:27:51,287
- Shut up.
- Fear me.

1009
01:27:51,332 --> 01:27:53,607
- Shut up.
- Fear me.

1010
01:27:53,652 --> 01:27:56,962
- It doesn't look good.
- Shut up.

1011
01:27:57,012 --> 01:28:00,527
It doesn't look good.
The drums have been talking.

1012
01:28:10,332 --> 01:28:12,288
And what have the drums been saying?

1013
01:28:12,332 --> 01:28:15,847
They've been saying
what Sam Gold's been hearing.

1014
01:28:18,132 --> 01:28:20,327
Fear me.

1015
01:28:20,372 --> 01:28:25,207
Hearing about the little problems Mr. Green
has been giving us, that's embarrassing.

1016
01:28:25,252 --> 01:28:28,483
We have an address for his brother.
We can take care of it.

1017
01:28:28,532 --> 01:28:30,921
Get him to talk, do whatever it takes.

1018
01:28:30,972 --> 01:28:34,089
Take Sorter and an army.
If they give any trouble, hurt 'em.

1019
01:28:34,132 --> 01:28:36,123
Let me read about that in the paper.

1020
01:28:36,172 --> 01:28:39,642
Get a hold of Green and get my powder.

1021
01:28:40,932 --> 01:28:42,843
Go.

1022
01:28:58,732 --> 01:29:00,768
Are we expecting anyone?

1023
01:29:00,812 --> 01:29:03,406
I'll get it.

1024
01:29:03,452 --> 01:29:06,250
I said, are we expecting anyone?

1025
01:29:06,292 --> 01:29:08,283
Shouldn't you check first?

1026
01:29:20,252 --> 01:29:25,326
If you love your daddy,
be a good girl, hide in that cupboard.

1027
01:29:25,372 --> 01:29:27,363
Now.

1028
01:29:54,732 --> 01:29:56,768
Check the house.

1029
01:29:59,332 --> 01:30:01,482
You know why we're here?

1030
01:30:04,532 --> 01:30:06,090
Serpent.

1031
01:30:11,132 --> 01:30:16,604
I said, do you know why we're here?

1032
01:30:17,652 --> 01:30:20,530
I've some kind of an idea, yes.

1033
01:30:21,572 --> 01:30:23,847
Are you going to tell me?

1034
01:30:23,892 --> 01:30:25,883
Paul, I swear to you,

1035
01:30:26,932 --> 01:30:29,605
I haven't got a fucking clue where he is.

1036
01:30:35,612 --> 01:30:37,603
He's been moving about.

1037
01:30:38,652 --> 01:30:41,041
I swear to you, I have no idea where he is.

1038
01:30:45,612 --> 01:30:47,603
It's all right.

1039
01:30:50,612 --> 01:30:53,684
That's it. That's better. That's better.

1040
01:31:09,892 --> 01:31:12,452
I still don't believe you.

1041
01:31:19,092 --> 01:31:22,368
You can't trust anyone.
They're out to destroy me.

1042
01:31:22,412 --> 01:31:24,801
They're out to destroy you.

1043
01:31:24,852 --> 01:31:27,571
- You can't trust anyone.
- I can't trust anyone.

1044
01:31:29,612 --> 01:31:31,603
Can't let Gold down.

1045
01:31:32,652 --> 01:31:34,643
He'll finish the business.

1046
01:31:35,692 --> 01:31:37,683
Then he'll finish me.

1047
01:31:39,092 --> 01:31:41,083
He's coming.

1048
01:31:41,132 --> 01:31:43,123
I won't see it coming.

1049
01:31:47,892 --> 01:31:50,884
He's coming. And I won't see it coming.

1050
01:31:50,932 --> 01:31:52,923
There's a woman here to see you, Mr. D.

1051
01:31:55,452 --> 01:31:57,443
Said she cannot wait.

1052
01:31:59,132 --> 01:32:01,123
Don't tell me her name.

1053
01:32:01,172 --> 01:32:04,642
- Says she works for Gold.
- Don't tell me her name. Anyone but her.

1054
01:32:04,692 --> 01:32:07,331
- What's her name?
- Walker.

1055
01:32:07,372 --> 01:32:08,521
Anyone but her.

1056
01:32:08,572 --> 01:32:12,406
And everybody thought you were
such a disgusting man, Mr. Macha.

1057
01:32:13,572 --> 01:32:16,450
Here it comes. Here it comes.

1058
01:32:16,492 --> 01:32:20,451
Mr. Gold wishes to extend his respect
for such a magnanimous gesture.

1059
01:32:20,492 --> 01:32:22,210
But he was wondering...

1060
01:32:22,252 --> 01:32:24,447
- That's a wreath.
- That's a fucking wreath.

1061
01:32:24,492 --> 01:32:27,290
...if you can afford the time to give so generously,

1062
01:32:27,332 --> 01:32:29,846
why you haven't had time
to conclude our business?

1063
01:32:29,892 --> 01:32:32,042
Everything's under control. I need more time.

1064
01:32:32,092 --> 01:32:35,084
It's anything but under control,
isn't it, Mr. Macha?

1065
01:32:36,692 --> 01:32:38,683
Mr. Gold doesn't give more time.

1066
01:32:40,732 --> 01:32:42,643
And he doesn't give second chances.

1067
01:32:45,932 --> 01:32:47,923
You will be hearing from him.

1068
01:32:47,972 --> 01:32:49,724
Good day.

1069
01:32:49,772 --> 01:32:52,605
"Good day?" What the fuck does that mean?

1070
01:32:52,652 --> 01:32:54,643
What the fuck does that mean?

1071
01:32:54,692 --> 01:32:57,160
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?

1072
01:32:57,212 --> 01:32:59,203
Some fucking street hustler?

1073
01:32:59,252 --> 01:33:03,006
If he wants to meet me, you send him here
and we'll see what he has to say.

1074
01:33:05,092 --> 01:33:07,401
I'll kill 'em, I'll kill all of 'em.

1075
01:33:07,452 --> 01:33:09,443
I'll kill 'em first.

1076
01:33:09,492 --> 01:33:12,564
They'll kill us first, they'll fucking annihilate me.

1077
01:33:12,612 --> 01:33:14,603
Beg, beg. Take it back, beg, beg.

1078
01:33:14,652 --> 01:33:16,643
Beg, you idiot.

1079
01:33:16,692 --> 01:33:20,082
Wait, wait. I didn't mean what I just said.

1080
01:33:26,812 --> 01:33:29,610
"Good day?" What the fuck does that mean?

1081
01:33:29,652 --> 01:33:34,009
That means he's going to end my game
and I won't see it coming.

1082
01:34:11,932 --> 01:34:14,241
I'm going to make this fair.

1083
01:34:14,292 --> 01:34:15,964
This...

1084
01:34:17,012 --> 01:34:19,003
...is for you.

1085
01:34:21,892 --> 01:34:23,450
These...

1086
01:34:25,092 --> 01:34:27,083
...for me.

1087
01:34:30,132 --> 01:34:34,683
One good chop, and you'll make the sink.

1088
01:34:37,892 --> 01:34:40,008
OK, that's enough.

1089
01:34:42,852 --> 01:34:47,164
Question me again, Sorter,
and we will have a falling out.

1090
01:34:58,132 --> 01:35:00,202
Tell me what's happening, Lou.

1091
01:35:00,252 --> 01:35:04,848
I got tired of waiting by the car, so I went inside.

1092
01:35:04,892 --> 01:35:09,647
Paul, he was getting excited,
you know how he does.

1093
01:35:09,692 --> 01:35:11,842
He started messing with the little girl's hair.

1094
01:35:11,892 --> 01:35:13,484
Out of nowhere, Sorter shot him.

1095
01:35:13,532 --> 01:35:15,409
Your daddy loves you so much.

1096
01:35:15,452 --> 01:35:16,851
- Shot who?
- Paul.

1097
01:35:19,132 --> 01:35:22,727
Then he turned the gun on the two bodyguards,
both gone in a blink of an eye.

1098
01:35:28,332 --> 01:35:30,323
Listen to me, sweetheart.

1099
01:35:30,372 --> 01:35:32,522
None of this is real.

1100
01:35:32,572 --> 01:35:34,927
It's just a game that the grown-ups are playing.

1101
01:35:36,012 --> 01:35:37,809
Now what I want you to do,

1102
01:35:37,852 --> 01:35:42,004
I want you to get in the cupboard
and I want you to put your fingers in your ears,

1103
01:35:42,052 --> 01:35:44,122
and it'll be all over before you know it.

1104
01:35:44,172 --> 01:35:46,163
Do as the man says, babe.

1105
01:35:46,212 --> 01:35:48,680
Put your fingers in your ears
and go in the cupboard.

1106
01:35:49,412 --> 01:35:50,731
Good girl.

1107
01:35:50,772 --> 01:35:52,808
Pull yourself together, man.

1108
01:35:52,852 --> 01:35:56,049
Sorter, we're going to have to take the girl.

1109
01:35:56,092 --> 01:35:59,562
Of course you have.
Now all you've got to do is come and get her.

1110
01:37:55,292 --> 01:37:57,248
I'm the only one left.

1111
01:37:57,292 --> 01:37:58,691
Where's the girl?

1112
01:38:08,732 --> 01:38:10,723
What are we doing here?

1113
01:38:10,772 --> 01:38:12,763
One last treat,

1114
01:38:12,812 --> 01:38:14,803
and bring the powder.

1115
01:38:24,332 --> 01:38:26,402
Jake Green is in the Casino.

1116
01:38:29,052 --> 01:38:31,043
How the fuck does he know?

1117
01:38:48,532 --> 01:38:50,363
Why are we here?

1118
01:38:50,412 --> 01:38:52,403
You have a meeting.

1119
01:38:54,212 --> 01:38:56,203
Got a little time to spare.

1120
01:38:56,252 --> 01:38:58,402
Let's have a game.

1121
01:38:58,452 --> 01:39:00,727
Bring him up.

1122
01:39:19,332 --> 01:39:22,529
You know what's so elegant
about this little game, Jake?

1123
01:39:24,692 --> 01:39:26,683
Nobody knows where the enemy is.

1124
01:39:27,732 --> 01:39:29,882
They don't even know he exists.

1125
01:39:36,132 --> 01:39:38,726
He's in every one of their heads.

1126
01:39:38,772 --> 01:39:40,603
And they trust him...

1127
01:39:43,692 --> 01:39:45,683
...because they think they are him.

1128
01:39:48,612 --> 01:39:55,085
If you try to destroy him to save them,
they'll destroy you to save him.

1129
01:39:55,132 --> 01:39:57,123
It's beautiful, man.

1130
01:39:57,932 --> 01:40:00,765
You have to admire the opponent's elegance.

1131
01:40:00,812 --> 01:40:02,643
Check.

1132
01:40:07,212 --> 01:40:11,888
You're quite good at this game, Mr. Green.
I know because I'm quite good at this game.

1133
01:40:16,372 --> 01:40:17,964
Check.

1134
01:40:25,972 --> 01:40:27,371
Check.

1135
01:40:34,732 --> 01:40:37,166
Check.

1136
01:40:45,332 --> 01:40:50,452
The art is for me to feed pieces to you,
and make you believe you took those pieces,

1137
01:40:50,492 --> 01:40:54,690
because you're smarter and I'm dumber.

1138
01:41:05,412 --> 01:41:06,527
Checkmate.

1139
01:41:20,852 --> 01:41:22,763
Wake up, Mr. Green.

1140
01:41:26,932 --> 01:41:29,002
You can't see what's right in front of you.

1141
01:41:35,092 --> 01:41:38,402
I never saw or spoke to those boys
in all those years,

1142
01:41:38,452 --> 01:41:41,888
but you know
I would have died for either one of them.

1143
01:41:41,932 --> 01:41:45,163
One was a chess master,
the other a master conman.

1144
01:41:45,212 --> 01:41:48,602
Dangerous combination, chess and cons.

1145
01:41:51,812 --> 01:41:53,962
Those two knew everything about me.

1146
01:41:54,012 --> 01:41:57,687
All my dirty little secrets,
how much money I had, where I kept it.

1147
01:41:57,732 --> 01:42:00,166
Hustling bastards cleaned me out.

1148
01:42:06,052 --> 01:42:09,761
My neighbors used to write down chess moves
and concepts of the con

1149
01:42:09,812 --> 01:42:15,170
in the back pages of books based on subjects
like The Mathematics Of Quantum Mechanics.

1150
01:42:15,212 --> 01:42:16,440
Wake up, Mr. Green.

1151
01:42:16,492 --> 01:42:19,290
We were all going to go together,
they swore to me.

1152
01:42:19,332 --> 01:42:21,402
"You're coming with us, Jake."

1153
01:42:21,452 --> 01:42:24,489
We were always going to take you with us, Jake.

1154
01:42:24,532 --> 01:42:28,650
You just weren't ready to hear
how hard that was going to be.

1155
01:42:33,252 --> 01:42:35,322
We didn't do this because we like you.

1156
01:42:36,772 --> 01:42:38,763
We did this because...

1157
01:42:41,212 --> 01:42:43,282
...we are you.

1158
01:43:00,572 --> 01:43:02,563
Time for that meeting.

1159
01:43:03,612 --> 01:43:06,046
Give him what he wants.

1160
01:43:06,092 --> 01:43:08,208
I'm sure that will make him very happy.

1161
01:43:25,012 --> 01:43:29,528
I know you're still there,
cos I can feel you dying.

1162
01:43:30,572 --> 01:43:34,451
I can hear you, tapping me for a little nutrition.

1163
01:43:36,452 --> 01:43:38,443
Now who's clucking for a fix?

1164
01:43:38,492 --> 01:43:41,245
Think it's a little tight in here, do you?

1165
01:43:42,252 --> 01:43:46,450
You're not wrong,
cos the walls are moving in.

1166
01:43:47,492 --> 01:43:50,689
No food here, not today, sunshine.

1167
01:43:51,732 --> 01:43:54,405
My eyes are open and the restaurant's closed.

1168
01:43:54,452 --> 01:43:57,364
Jog on, slide off.

1169
01:43:57,412 --> 01:44:00,006
Find someone else to fill your pipe,

1170
01:44:00,052 --> 01:44:05,763
someone who won't see you coming
or know when you're there.

1171
01:44:11,532 --> 01:44:15,844
You think I'm an evil man.
You think I am an evil man, don't you?

1172
01:44:17,292 --> 01:44:20,011
Rachel, look at me, honey.

1173
01:44:23,892 --> 01:44:26,360
Think I don't know your fucking game?

1174
01:44:26,412 --> 01:44:30,883
I do, I know your game,
I see your game, I am your game.

1175
01:44:30,932 --> 01:44:34,129
Rachel, look at me, baby.

1176
01:44:37,612 --> 01:44:40,763
You don't play by the rules, Mr. Green.

1177
01:44:40,812 --> 01:44:47,206
You like to play silly games with my head,
don't you?

1178
01:44:49,972 --> 01:44:53,248
- You're a fucking survivor,
- A winner.

1179
01:44:53,292 --> 01:44:57,171
- You're a pussy drowning in his own shit.
- Shut up and leave me alone.

1180
01:44:58,252 --> 01:45:00,812
He chose his hiding place very carefully.

1181
01:45:00,852 --> 01:45:03,650
I can't let him kill me.

1182
01:45:03,692 --> 01:45:05,683
You're weak. It's too late.

1183
01:45:05,732 --> 01:45:08,121
You're a dead man anyway.
You'll be dead before dawn.

1184
01:45:08,172 --> 01:45:10,686
The word "excuse" does not exist
in Sam Gold's lexicon.

1185
01:45:10,732 --> 01:45:13,041
This is Sam Gold I found myself chained to.

1186
01:45:13,092 --> 01:45:15,083
Mr. Black Magic.

1187
01:45:15,132 --> 01:45:17,123
Mr. "l-run-this-game" Gold.

1188
01:45:17,172 --> 01:45:20,050
We can't see Gold.
Apparently, no-one sees Gold.

1189
01:45:20,092 --> 01:45:21,810
No-one gets away from Gold.

1190
01:45:23,812 --> 01:45:25,609
Get control of yourself.

1191
01:45:25,652 --> 01:45:28,724
It's anything but under control,
isn't it, Mr. Macha?

1192
01:45:28,772 --> 01:45:33,288
He's going to kill me, he'll kill me.
Where's your pride? Where's your pride?

1193
01:45:37,212 --> 01:45:40,124
I'd rather kill myself than let him kill me.

1194
01:45:42,212 --> 01:45:45,443
Why isn't he scared? He's just staring at me.

1195
01:45:48,092 --> 01:45:51,562
- You'll be hearing from him.
- But he can't kill a dead man.

1196
01:45:51,612 --> 01:45:54,001
But he can't kill a dead man,

1197
01:45:54,052 --> 01:45:56,043
can he?

1198
01:45:59,932 --> 01:46:01,923
He can't kill a dead man, can he?

1199
01:46:08,252 --> 01:46:10,527
You can't even do it, can you?

1200
01:46:22,332 --> 01:46:25,449
The greatest con that he ever pulled

1201
01:46:26,492 --> 01:46:29,211
...was making you believe...

1202
01:46:30,252 --> 01:46:31,970
...that he is you.
