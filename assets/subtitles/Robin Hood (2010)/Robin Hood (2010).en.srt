2
00:02:21,367 --> 00:02:24,165
Can somebody
tell me what's going on?

3
00:02:24,247 --> 00:02:25,965
Don't be foolish, Walter.
Get him back to bed.

4
00:02:26,047 --> 00:02:27,605
- Bar the door.
- I'm still the master of this house.

5
00:02:27,687 --> 00:02:29,006
Richard, up.

6
00:02:31,607 --> 00:02:33,006
Who is there?

7
00:02:33,567 --> 00:02:34,602
Wake up, Thomas.

8
00:02:40,047 --> 00:02:41,526
Open the gates!

9
00:02:50,847 --> 00:02:52,041
Bastards.

10
00:02:52,847 --> 00:02:53,962
Arrow.

11
00:02:57,887 --> 00:02:59,240
The lantern.

12
00:03:09,527 --> 00:03:11,279
I see you, you little bastards.

13
00:03:11,847 --> 00:03:13,121
I see you!

14
00:03:25,367 --> 00:03:26,925
Thieving maggots.

15
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,716
They've taken all our seed grain.

16
00:03:30,447 --> 00:03:32,915
What are we going to do for planting?

17
00:03:33,727 --> 00:03:34,796
Pray.

18
00:04:36,927 --> 00:04:38,360
Hello, there!

19
00:04:50,887 --> 00:04:53,321
- Here you go, lad.
- Thank you, Robin.

20
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:54,882
Robin.

21
00:04:55,407 --> 00:04:56,726
The archers been called to ranks.

22
00:04:56,807 --> 00:04:58,604
Bloody typical. I'm starving.

23
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,116
Hide these well.

24
00:05:01,487 --> 00:05:03,876
We'll have them for supper instead.

25
00:05:19,847 --> 00:05:20,916
Sire.

26
00:05:22,167 --> 00:05:23,680
Your bath, Sire.

27
00:05:40,927 --> 00:05:43,487
For the love of Christ, Loxley,
would you stop them doing that!

28
00:05:43,567 --> 00:05:45,046
They love you, Sire.

29
00:05:45,127 --> 00:05:47,595
My head. It's going like the bells of hell.

30
00:05:50,447 --> 00:05:51,482
Is that it?

31
00:05:51,567 --> 00:05:55,765
One more castle to sack,
then we're home to England.

32
00:05:56,927 --> 00:05:58,997
Hail King Richard!

33
00:06:04,007 --> 00:06:05,201
Release!

34
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,795
Push!

35
00:06:08,047 --> 00:06:09,366
Push!

36
00:06:10,487 --> 00:06:11,806
Hey, archer!

37
00:06:12,207 --> 00:06:13,401
Stay alive!

38
00:06:13,487 --> 00:06:14,636
I'll see you tonight.

39
00:06:14,927 --> 00:06:16,679
Don't forget your money this time, little man.

40
00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:18,678
It will be my pleasure to take it off you.

41
00:06:20,527 --> 00:06:21,562
Push!

42
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,241
Move up!

43
00:06:32,567 --> 00:06:34,523
Cover the King! Cover the King!

44
00:06:38,247 --> 00:06:40,283
Barricades prepare!

45
00:06:48,767 --> 00:06:50,678
Let us put these French to bed!

46
00:06:54,967 --> 00:06:56,923
Raise the barricades!

47
00:07:09,487 --> 00:07:10,602
Jimmy.

48
00:07:11,087 --> 00:07:12,839
Calm and careful. Make it count.

49
00:07:13,087 --> 00:07:14,076
Go!

50
00:07:36,047 --> 00:07:37,036
Help!

51
00:07:38,607 --> 00:07:39,722
Cover!

52
00:07:51,047 --> 00:07:52,082
Now.

53
00:07:55,367 --> 00:07:56,356
Go!

54
00:08:05,287 --> 00:08:06,561
Move back!

55
00:08:07,967 --> 00:08:09,605
Blood for France!

56
00:08:11,327 --> 00:08:12,316
Go!

57
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:15,524
Lt'll make a fine pin cushion!

58
00:08:15,607 --> 00:08:17,563
King Philip's arse!

59
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:36,679
Look what they do for the Lion Heart!

60
00:08:39,487 --> 00:08:40,522
Push!

61
00:08:41,127 --> 00:08:42,401
Push!

62
00:08:42,487 --> 00:08:45,399
That'll burn all night, lads.
Don't let them put it out.

63
00:08:45,487 --> 00:08:48,763
These pricks will smash through
in the morning, take all the credit.

64
00:08:48,847 --> 00:08:50,326
Well done, Jimmy boy.

65
00:09:10,527 --> 00:09:11,721
John...

66
00:09:11,807 --> 00:09:13,206
Your Majesty.

67
00:09:13,807 --> 00:09:16,719
An English princess
shut out of her husband's bedchamber

68
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:18,843
by a piece of French pastry!

69
00:09:18,927 --> 00:09:20,406
Aren't you ashamed?

70
00:09:20,487 --> 00:09:22,239
The shame is surely his.

71
00:09:22,327 --> 00:09:24,238
Then go in and tell him.

72
00:09:24,327 --> 00:09:27,797
Mewling at his keyhole
is neither one thing nor the other.

73
00:09:28,887 --> 00:09:29,922
John.

74
00:09:35,127 --> 00:09:36,799
Oh, God! What in heaven...

75
00:09:36,887 --> 00:09:41,039
<i>Mademoiselle, you will excuse me.
My son has need of my advice.</i>

76
00:09:41,127 --> 00:09:42,845
No, I don't. Ask her.

77
00:09:44,887 --> 00:09:46,525
Mother, please, have you no decency?

78
00:09:46,607 --> 00:09:50,964
I happen to be in a condition
that no mother should see her son in.

79
00:09:54,647 --> 00:09:57,400
- Yes, I know, but it's my mother.
- That's enough.

80
00:09:57,487 --> 00:10:01,958
On second thoughts, I think it better
that you do hear what I have to say.

81
00:10:02,047 --> 00:10:04,766
Though I will not have you in my presence.

82
00:10:05,407 --> 00:10:06,396
Mother.

83
00:10:06,487 --> 00:10:10,196
The purpose of my being in this room
is to save the realm

84
00:10:10,287 --> 00:10:14,200
from the consequences
of this unsuitable amusement.

85
00:10:14,287 --> 00:10:16,801
Her uncle is the bloody King of France.

86
00:10:18,007 --> 00:10:19,884
- My uncle is...
- Get down.

87
00:10:20,607 --> 00:10:22,518
Her uncle wants her back.

88
00:10:22,927 --> 00:10:26,124
Philip wants an excuse to cross

89
00:10:28,407 --> 00:10:30,125
the Channel with an army.

90
00:10:30,207 --> 00:10:32,675
And you have given him that excuse.

91
00:10:33,607 --> 00:10:36,440
Take up your lawful wife and save England.

92
00:10:36,527 --> 00:10:40,042
My lawful wife is as barren as a brick.

93
00:10:40,367 --> 00:10:42,961
Is that truly the wife you want for me?

94
00:10:43,367 --> 00:10:44,482
Hmm?

95
00:10:44,567 --> 00:10:47,718
You, who honoured your husband
with eight children

96
00:10:47,807 --> 00:10:50,241
so that even now
when death has taken the rest

97
00:10:50,327 --> 00:10:55,082
you have a king and the runt of the litter
to call you "Mother.' '

98
00:10:55,567 --> 00:10:57,717
Better the bastard of a servant girl

99
00:10:57,807 --> 00:11:00,275
than bed the niece
of England's jealous enemy.

100
00:11:00,367 --> 00:11:02,835
Or bed her and wed her, Mother.

101
00:11:02,927 --> 00:11:05,395
I've asked the Pope's men
to arrange an annulment.

102
00:11:05,487 --> 00:11:07,159
And do you think the Pope

103
00:11:07,247 --> 00:11:10,683
will favour England's royal runt
over the King of France?

104
00:11:10,767 --> 00:11:13,725
He might see his way
for the son of Eleanor of Aquitaine.

105
00:11:13,847 --> 00:11:16,122
And for the future King of England.

106
00:11:16,207 --> 00:11:19,836
Richard the Lion Heart is 40-years-old,
if not more.

107
00:11:21,087 --> 00:11:22,520
And no babies.

108
00:11:23,687 --> 00:11:25,678
I am a queen in the making.

109
00:11:27,847 --> 00:11:29,519
Yes. Yes.

110
00:11:31,127 --> 00:11:32,276
You see?

111
00:11:33,447 --> 00:11:35,677
She is my Eleanor.

112
00:11:38,807 --> 00:11:42,038
Now, you do understand,
this game is not about luck.

113
00:11:42,127 --> 00:11:44,925
It's about the science of memory
and a quick hand.

114
00:11:45,007 --> 00:11:46,645
Who'd like to take
a bit of fresh meat home?

115
00:11:46,727 --> 00:11:48,718
Caught this morning. We have a pheasant.

116
00:11:48,807 --> 00:11:51,196
Three choices. Right, left or middle?

117
00:11:51,287 --> 00:11:52,322
Middle.

118
00:11:52,407 --> 00:11:54,716
"The middle," he says. The middle.

119
00:11:54,807 --> 00:11:58,686
I'm sorry about those onions, young man.
You lose.

120
00:11:58,767 --> 00:12:00,246
Robin! Over here, they're needed for the pot.

121
00:12:00,327 --> 00:12:01,680
Feisty one!

122
00:12:02,527 --> 00:12:05,166
Aye, what else we got, what else we got?

123
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,839
The fire will do its work.

124
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:09,395
We break through at first light.

125
00:12:09,487 --> 00:12:12,957
With a fair wind,
we can be home in three days.

126
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,356
You return to Nottingham?

127
00:12:16,087 --> 00:12:19,079
I have a wife who waits for me.

128
00:12:20,367 --> 00:12:22,881
I have a mother that won't die

129
00:12:23,527 --> 00:12:25,563
and a brother who wishes me dead.

130
00:12:25,647 --> 00:12:28,115
First thing I'm going to do is lock them up.

131
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:30,767
Your people will rejoice
to see you return home.

132
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,315
And that is a condition
I would like to keep them in.

133
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,318
To be remembered as I was.

134
00:12:37,367 --> 00:12:38,402
My army knows better.

135
00:12:40,887 --> 00:12:43,276
Lion Heart is mangy.

136
00:12:43,887 --> 00:12:47,800
Every man in that army idolises you,
Your Majesty.

137
00:12:47,887 --> 00:12:49,605
Don't mollycoddle me.

138
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:54,077
I understand how difficult it must be
to befriend a king.

139
00:12:54,847 --> 00:12:58,522
Come on, Loxley.
Let us find some ruffians, drink and laugh.

140
00:12:59,407 --> 00:13:01,967
Let us see if we can find an honest man.

141
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:03,116
Yes.

142
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,116
Let's do that.

143
00:13:15,807 --> 00:13:18,526
Well, that's the thing, little man.
This is not a game of luck.

144
00:13:18,607 --> 00:13:21,804
It's about the science of memory
and a quick hand.

145
00:13:21,887 --> 00:13:25,562
I've got a quick eye. I'll be watching you.

146
00:13:37,527 --> 00:13:39,119
Three choices.

147
00:13:39,207 --> 00:13:41,402
Right, left, or middle.

148
00:13:42,847 --> 00:13:45,202
I think I'll take a fourth choice.

149
00:13:46,127 --> 00:13:48,038
- A fourth?
- Hmm.

150
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:51,085
I've been watching you
for a while now, Longstride.

151
00:13:51,167 --> 00:13:53,397
There is no pea.

152
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,683
This game is a trick!

153
00:13:56,767 --> 00:14:00,726
You take out the pea when you're doing
your slidings and your turnings.

154
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:02,035
I got you.

155
00:14:07,007 --> 00:14:08,759
Don't touch it again.

156
00:14:09,607 --> 00:14:10,926
I'll do it!

157
00:14:31,127 --> 00:14:32,321
You lose.

158
00:14:50,527 --> 00:14:52,085
You're doing better than you think.

159
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:53,839
Get in there, Robin.

160
00:15:02,847 --> 00:15:05,520
Kneel, you ignorant bastards!

161
00:15:05,607 --> 00:15:07,359
Kneel before the King!

162
00:15:09,807 --> 00:15:11,399
All of you, move back, now.

163
00:15:11,487 --> 00:15:15,400
No, no, Loxley.
These men are soldiers at play.

164
00:15:15,487 --> 00:15:17,557
Sinners after mine own heart.

165
00:15:18,367 --> 00:15:20,756
Which one of you started the fight?

166
00:15:23,007 --> 00:15:24,326
I did, Sire.

167
00:15:25,647 --> 00:15:27,638
I threw the first punch.

168
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:29,001
Ah, honest man.

169
00:15:29,927 --> 00:15:31,155
And who're you fighting?

170
00:15:32,407 --> 00:15:35,126
He was fighting me, Your Majesty.

171
00:15:35,207 --> 00:15:37,243
I thought him to be a lesser man.

172
00:15:38,127 --> 00:15:39,685
He was showing me different.

173
00:15:41,327 --> 00:15:43,557
An enemy that shows his respect.

174
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,322
Stand up, the pair of you.

175
00:15:46,407 --> 00:15:47,601
Not you.

176
00:15:52,167 --> 00:15:54,886
Brave and honest.

177
00:15:56,247 --> 00:16:00,718
Are you honest enough to tell a king
something that he does not want to hear?

178
00:16:01,087 --> 00:16:03,476
What is your opinion on my crusade?

179
00:16:05,727 --> 00:16:08,878
Will God be pleased with my sacrifice?

180
00:16:18,007 --> 00:16:19,406
No, he won't.

181
00:16:21,127 --> 00:16:22,799
Why do you say that?

182
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,643
The massacre at Acre, Sire.

183
00:16:26,607 --> 00:16:27,801
Speak up!

184
00:16:29,687 --> 00:16:33,999
When you had us herd 2,500 Muslim men,
women, and children together,

185
00:16:34,087 --> 00:16:38,160
the young woman at my feet,
with her hands bound, she looked up at me.

186
00:16:39,047 --> 00:16:42,084
There wasn't fear in her eyes.
There wasn't anger.

187
00:16:42,967 --> 00:16:44,685
There was only pity.

188
00:16:47,127 --> 00:16:49,846
For she knew that when you gave the order

189
00:16:50,807 --> 00:16:53,765
and our blades
would descend upon their heads,

190
00:16:54,207 --> 00:16:56,846
that, in that moment, we would be godless.

191
00:16:57,607 --> 00:16:58,881
All of us.

192
00:17:01,167 --> 00:17:02,316
Godless.

193
00:17:06,807 --> 00:17:07,922
Honest,

194
00:17:09,207 --> 00:17:10,242
brave

195
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:12,721
and naïve.

196
00:17:14,807 --> 00:17:16,877
There is your Englishman.

197
00:17:17,927 --> 00:17:19,280
Right there.

198
00:17:21,527 --> 00:17:23,836
- Well done, Robin.
- You showed him.

199
00:17:24,287 --> 00:17:25,720
The whipping will be the worst of it.

200
00:17:25,847 --> 00:17:27,121
The branding iron, that will be the worst.

201
00:17:27,207 --> 00:17:28,356
Unless they hang us.

202
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:30,881
No. No, this will be the worst of it.

203
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:35,119
And this will be the end of it.
As soon as I get out of here, I'm gone.

204
00:17:35,727 --> 00:17:39,242
I don't owe God or any other man here
one more minute of service.

205
00:18:37,727 --> 00:18:40,446
We go all the way back to the same breast.

206
00:18:42,647 --> 00:18:43,841
Wet nurse.

207
00:18:43,927 --> 00:18:45,042
Indeed.

208
00:18:46,767 --> 00:18:47,882
We've been close ever since.

209
00:18:49,927 --> 00:18:50,996
Good.

210
00:18:53,327 --> 00:18:56,399
Because England, under your friend John,

211
00:18:57,847 --> 00:19:00,361
is a country with no fighting spirit.

212
00:19:01,047 --> 00:19:03,641
I can take London with an army of cooks.

213
00:19:04,447 --> 00:19:06,642
But Richard is on his way home.

214
00:19:07,327 --> 00:19:11,320
And under Richard,
England is a different animal altogether.

215
00:19:12,127 --> 00:19:15,403
Richard will return home
through the Forest of Broceliande.

216
00:19:16,407 --> 00:19:18,318
We know the exact place.

217
00:19:18,807 --> 00:19:24,518
He always travels ahead of his army
with only a few trusted knights around him.

218
00:19:25,767 --> 00:19:29,806
With Richard dead, it will be easy for you
to turn the country against John.

219
00:19:30,647 --> 00:19:32,797
There'll never be a better moment to invade.

220
00:19:37,167 --> 00:19:39,601
Even dying animals can be obstinate.

221
00:19:42,527 --> 00:19:45,360
Kill the Lion Heart
and you will be richly rewarded.

222
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:04,402
Heave!

223
00:20:05,687 --> 00:20:06,802
Heave!

224
00:20:22,687 --> 00:20:23,802
Heave!

225
00:20:24,767 --> 00:20:26,325
For England!

226
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,200
For England!

227
00:20:41,527 --> 00:20:43,119
I need a physician here!

228
00:20:43,207 --> 00:20:45,084
A physician! Quickly!

229
00:20:45,167 --> 00:20:46,805
Give us cover! Give us cover, now!

230
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,036
Cover him!

231
00:20:52,407 --> 00:20:53,442
Cover the King.

232
00:20:54,207 --> 00:20:56,357
Physician!

233
00:20:57,367 --> 00:20:58,846
Why, Loxley? Are you not feeling well?

234
00:20:59,207 --> 00:21:00,925
Physician!

235
00:21:07,087 --> 00:21:08,122
Wine.

236
00:21:30,287 --> 00:21:31,606
What's this?

237
00:21:32,727 --> 00:21:34,797
- The King is dead!
- Dead?

238
00:21:35,607 --> 00:21:36,642
Dead.

239
00:21:37,007 --> 00:21:41,478
All right, then, Jimmy. Knock the pegs out.
We make our own fate from now on!

240
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,161
I'll come with you.

241
00:21:46,247 --> 00:21:49,045
No, you're not. We don't take strays.

242
00:21:49,127 --> 00:21:50,116
The more the merrier.

243
00:21:50,207 --> 00:21:51,959
The road will be dangerous.
He might be useful.

244
00:21:52,047 --> 00:21:53,082
Where we going?

245
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:56,637
To the coast and to a boat
before 3,000 desperate soldiers get there

246
00:21:56,727 --> 00:21:59,002
and the price for a Channel crossing
goes up a hundredfold.

247
00:21:59,087 --> 00:22:00,406
What about our wages?

248
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:03,399
If you thought it was hard getting wages
while he was alive,

249
00:22:03,487 --> 00:22:05,239
try getting paid by a dead king.

250
00:22:05,327 --> 00:22:08,399
All right, boys,
collect your gear as quick as you can.

251
00:22:13,927 --> 00:22:15,724
I like the new church.

252
00:22:18,687 --> 00:22:19,961
Lady Marion.

253
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:25,121
I would have been sorry to leave
without your farewell. Thank you.

254
00:22:26,167 --> 00:22:28,476
I'm glad to speed you on your way,
Father Tancred,

255
00:22:28,567 --> 00:22:31,764
but it was to seek out our new shepherd.

256
00:22:31,847 --> 00:22:36,125
You have lately been missed
at Sunday worship and my sermons.

257
00:22:36,887 --> 00:22:40,675
I like a quiet church, Father,
when I pray for a miracle.

258
00:22:47,607 --> 00:22:51,566
Your new flock is women,
children and old folk.

259
00:22:51,647 --> 00:22:53,683
Our men have gone to war
or returned broken.

260
00:22:54,127 --> 00:22:56,721
Their orphans run wild in the greenwood.

261
00:23:00,127 --> 00:23:03,278
Our fields are ready for planting
but we've no seed corn.

262
00:23:03,687 --> 00:23:06,360
And the church barn is full of grain.

263
00:23:06,447 --> 00:23:08,961
Surely, you do not expect the church

264
00:23:09,047 --> 00:23:11,845
to let its corn be used to plant your fields?

265
00:23:11,927 --> 00:23:14,600
That grain is bound for York.

266
00:23:15,767 --> 00:23:17,325
I am Friar Tuck.

267
00:23:18,007 --> 00:23:19,759
Father Tancred is elevated to York

268
00:23:19,847 --> 00:23:22,486
where I know he will remind the Bishop
that the people of Nottingham...

269
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:26,162
The Bishop does not need reminding
that the people of Nottingham

270
00:23:26,247 --> 00:23:30,160
should reap what they sow
and repent of their sins.

271
00:23:30,447 --> 00:23:34,281
The miracle I pray for is that
the Bishop show some Christian charity.

272
00:23:37,927 --> 00:23:41,158
As I said, Father,
I like a quiet church when I pray.

273
00:23:57,367 --> 00:24:00,518
You will have trouble
from the Loxleys of Peper Harow.

274
00:24:04,127 --> 00:24:06,436
You keep bees, Tuck?

275
00:24:06,527 --> 00:24:08,597
I keep them and they keep me.

276
00:24:32,527 --> 00:24:34,040
Stop!

277
00:24:35,447 --> 00:24:36,562
Ambush!

278
00:25:51,127 --> 00:25:52,242
You're a knight?

279
00:25:53,167 --> 00:25:54,964
Where is King Richard?

280
00:25:55,607 --> 00:25:56,756
Oh, God.

281
00:25:57,207 --> 00:25:58,242
Where is the King?

282
00:25:59,367 --> 00:26:00,880
- Dead.
- Dead?

283
00:26:02,087 --> 00:26:03,236
Really?

284
00:26:05,047 --> 00:26:08,357
If the King's dead, where are you going?

285
00:26:09,847 --> 00:26:10,882
Deliver the crown.

286
00:26:12,687 --> 00:26:14,200
Richard's crown.

287
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:15,842
Richard's crown.

288
00:26:19,527 --> 00:26:21,563
How do we assassinate a king
who's already dead?

289
00:26:30,167 --> 00:26:32,681
Bring back the crown!
Kill the horse!

290
00:26:36,167 --> 00:26:37,680
You are English.

291
00:26:38,767 --> 00:26:40,325
When it suits me.

292
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:43,156
Who are you?

293
00:26:44,607 --> 00:26:46,518
Robert Loxley.

294
00:27:02,647 --> 00:27:04,558
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

295
00:27:06,447 --> 00:27:08,324
That's the King's horse.

296
00:27:13,207 --> 00:27:15,038
Jimmy! Move!

297
00:27:25,087 --> 00:27:26,156
Jimmy!

298
00:27:38,687 --> 00:27:40,200
Robin, they're French.

299
00:27:40,287 --> 00:27:41,402
Ambush.

300
00:27:59,207 --> 00:28:00,242
Go.

301
00:28:36,607 --> 00:28:37,676
John.

302
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,082
Don't know.

303
00:28:40,247 --> 00:28:41,521
He's dead.

304
00:28:41,687 --> 00:28:42,756
Help.

305
00:28:51,127 --> 00:28:52,355
My sword.

306
00:29:02,247 --> 00:29:04,158
Its value to me is great.

307
00:29:05,367 --> 00:29:07,278
It belonged to my father,

308
00:29:08,487 --> 00:29:09,602
Sir Walter Loxley

309
00:29:10,807 --> 00:29:12,240
of Nottingham.

310
00:29:14,167 --> 00:29:15,441
Do you know it?

311
00:29:15,527 --> 00:29:18,166
Aye, I've heard of Nottingham.

312
00:29:21,647 --> 00:29:23,046
Then the fate...

313
00:29:23,127 --> 00:29:25,163
The fates have smiled on me.

314
00:29:28,327 --> 00:29:32,605
You must take the sword to my father.

315
00:29:33,767 --> 00:29:35,598
It will bring me peace.

316
00:29:38,807 --> 00:29:42,277
I took it in anger and without his consent.

317
00:29:43,647 --> 00:29:46,639
You must understand the bond of love

318
00:29:46,727 --> 00:29:48,843
between a father and his son.

319
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:53,121
My father abandoned me to the world of men
when I was six years old.

320
00:29:53,207 --> 00:29:55,721
I know little of the love
between father and son.

321
00:29:56,367 --> 00:29:57,641
I beg you.

322
00:29:58,047 --> 00:29:59,639
Longstride,

323
00:29:59,727 --> 00:30:01,126
say you will.

324
00:30:05,967 --> 00:30:07,116
I will.

325
00:30:27,007 --> 00:30:29,043
It's a pact sworn in blood, Robin.

326
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:32,763
It's a scratch, Allan, and that's all it is.

327
00:30:52,247 --> 00:30:53,362
Robin!

328
00:31:00,087 --> 00:31:03,124
Loxley was making for the coast
to meet the ship.

329
00:31:06,967 --> 00:31:08,559
That crown could be our passage home.

330
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:10,400
We're common archers, Robin.

331
00:31:10,487 --> 00:31:13,206
If we arrive at the King's ship
with his crown, we'll be accused of murder.

332
00:31:13,607 --> 00:31:15,438
How do you know

333
00:31:15,527 --> 00:31:19,520
that the knights you see walking about
are actually knights at all?

334
00:31:19,607 --> 00:31:21,996
There is no difference between a knight

335
00:31:22,087 --> 00:31:24,999
and any other man
aside from what he wears.

336
00:31:26,047 --> 00:31:27,924
All we need is about us.

337
00:31:28,607 --> 00:31:31,644
Armour, helmets, swords,

338
00:31:33,527 --> 00:31:36,883
and we make England wealthy men

339
00:31:38,367 --> 00:31:40,562
with horses and gold.

340
00:31:41,407 --> 00:31:44,524
Fate has smiled upon us at last.

341
00:31:45,407 --> 00:31:48,080
And I, for one, shall not turn my back on her.

342
00:31:50,167 --> 00:31:52,556
Take that crown off your head, Will,

343
00:31:52,647 --> 00:31:53,682
and fill it to the brim.

344
00:31:58,647 --> 00:32:00,842
We commit the soul of this boy
to your keeping, Lord.

345
00:32:00,927 --> 00:32:04,363
We would ask, when he arrives
at the gates of eternity,

346
00:32:04,447 --> 00:32:05,926
if you could let him in.

347
00:32:19,207 --> 00:32:23,200
Goliath's got the soil turning nicely.
But for what?

348
00:32:23,807 --> 00:32:26,367
- Nettles?
- Nettle soup and dandelion salad,

349
00:32:26,447 --> 00:32:27,436
that'll keep us alive.

350
00:32:27,527 --> 00:32:28,562
Come, Goliath. This way.

351
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:30,205
Until we get a miracle.

352
00:32:30,967 --> 00:32:32,161
This way.

353
00:32:38,967 --> 00:32:40,559
Marion, Sheriff.

354
00:32:47,287 --> 00:32:51,565
Marion, I've been at Peper Harow,
waiting in vain

355
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:54,003
for Sir Walter to receive me.

356
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:58,725
Kindly tell him I have better things to do
than haunt his threshold.

357
00:32:58,807 --> 00:33:01,367
That you have,
while robbers are roaming free in Sherwood.

358
00:33:01,447 --> 00:33:03,597
That's sheriff's business.
Why don't you look to it?

359
00:33:03,687 --> 00:33:05,837
Tell the old fool that next time,
I'll break his door down.

360
00:33:06,047 --> 00:33:09,483
- And if he's too proud to pay...
- No, no, no, no. He's not too proud.

361
00:33:09,567 --> 00:33:11,000
He's too poor.

362
00:33:11,087 --> 00:33:13,362
In the name of King Richard,
you have stripped our wealth

363
00:33:13,447 --> 00:33:14,766
to pay for foreign adventures.

364
00:33:15,087 --> 00:33:17,442
Whilst at home, the Church,
in the name of the merciful God,

365
00:33:17,527 --> 00:33:21,759
has reaped, without mercy, the largest share
of what we had set aside to feed ourselves.

366
00:33:22,727 --> 00:33:25,195
Between a sheriff and a bishop,
I wouldn't care to judge

367
00:33:25,287 --> 00:33:27,437
who's the greater curse
on honest English folk.

368
00:33:29,287 --> 00:33:30,640
Marion,

369
00:33:30,727 --> 00:33:33,639
why, oh, why do you make an enemy of me

370
00:33:33,727 --> 00:33:35,763
when you have the means
to make me your protector?

371
00:33:36,127 --> 00:33:37,480
What means?

372
00:33:42,407 --> 00:33:43,760
If you leave now,

373
00:33:43,927 --> 00:33:46,282
I will lengthen your life
by not telling my husband

374
00:33:46,367 --> 00:33:48,801
of your visit when he returns home.

375
00:33:48,887 --> 00:33:51,640
Your husband? After 10 years?

376
00:33:53,367 --> 00:33:56,996
If he's not dead, he's rutting his way
through the brothels of the Barbary Coast.

377
00:33:57,287 --> 00:33:59,437
So speaks a man of experience.

378
00:33:59,527 --> 00:34:01,245
Well, think on it, Marion.

379
00:34:01,727 --> 00:34:04,082
Sir Walter is dying without an heir.

380
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:07,955
Peper Harow will fall to the crown,
and you will be living in the hedgerow.

381
00:34:08,247 --> 00:34:09,919
You'll be glad to come to me then.

382
00:34:42,767 --> 00:34:44,325
Captain, there.

383
00:35:02,807 --> 00:35:06,482
Sir, we were told
to expect 12 riders and the King.

384
00:35:07,447 --> 00:35:09,358
Our beloved King is dead.

385
00:35:11,327 --> 00:35:14,325
Long live the King.

386
00:35:14,807 --> 00:35:15,922
And you are, sir?

387
00:35:17,527 --> 00:35:21,759
Sir Robert Loxley of Nottingham. And you?

388
00:35:22,327 --> 00:35:24,238
I'm the King's equerry, Sir.

389
00:35:24,327 --> 00:35:27,603
Come aboard, gentlemen,
before the tide floats her. It's coming in fast.

390
00:35:38,447 --> 00:35:42,918
<i>And it's row, me bully boys
We're in a hurry, boys</i>

391
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:46,079
<i>We got a long way to go</i>

392
00:35:46,167 --> 00:35:49,921
<i>Where we'll sing and we'll dance
And bid farewell to France</i>

393
00:35:50,007 --> 00:35:53,795
<i>And row, me bully boys, row</i>

394
00:35:54,247 --> 00:35:58,638
<i>And it's row, me bully boys
We're in a hurry boys</i>

395
00:35:58,727 --> 00:36:01,958
<i>We got a long way to go</i>

396
00:36:02,047 --> 00:36:05,483
<i>We'll sing and we'll dance
And bid farewell to France</i>

397
00:36:05,567 --> 00:36:09,242
<i>And row, me bully boys, row</i>

398
00:36:14,727 --> 00:36:16,558
So what's the plan in the morning?

399
00:36:17,727 --> 00:36:20,685
The boat stops at Gravesend
on the way to London.

400
00:36:20,767 --> 00:36:24,043
We'll leave the honour of returning
the crown to them, and we'll be gone.

401
00:36:24,447 --> 00:36:25,562
Where?

402
00:36:26,407 --> 00:36:27,556
North.

403
00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:31,003
Well, that suits me.

404
00:36:31,087 --> 00:36:34,636
<i>Row, me bully boys, row</i>

405
00:36:34,727 --> 00:36:37,446
<i>But now we're returning
So lock up your daughters</i>

406
00:36:56,887 --> 00:37:00,402
<i>We'll sing and we'll dance
And bid farewell to France</i>

407
00:37:00,487 --> 00:37:04,241
<i>And it's row, me bully boys, row</i>

408
00:37:44,807 --> 00:37:47,799
Make ready, Sir Robert.
We dock in 20 minutes.

409
00:37:48,407 --> 00:37:49,442
Gravesend?

410
00:37:49,527 --> 00:37:52,803
No, My Lord.
The palace docks, Tower of London.

411
00:38:01,807 --> 00:38:02,842
Will.

412
00:38:04,327 --> 00:38:05,521
John. Allan.

413
00:38:07,167 --> 00:38:09,237
- Where are we?
- London.

414
00:38:09,527 --> 00:38:10,846
Holy Christ!

415
00:38:12,367 --> 00:38:14,164
We dock in 10 minutes.

416
00:38:14,687 --> 00:38:16,678
When this is done, be ready to ride.

417
00:38:16,767 --> 00:38:18,598
What if... What if Loxley is known

418
00:38:18,687 --> 00:38:20,678
to the King's mother or brother
or any of them?

419
00:38:20,767 --> 00:38:22,644
Then we'll be riding for our lives.

420
00:38:22,727 --> 00:38:26,003
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
Peter and Paul and Mary!

421
00:38:26,087 --> 00:38:27,520
I knew it! I knew it!

422
00:38:29,367 --> 00:38:30,516
Good morning, My Lord.

423
00:38:30,607 --> 00:38:33,917
Some words of advice
on this tragic occasion.

424
00:38:34,567 --> 00:38:37,127
You appreciate
everything must be done correctly,

425
00:38:37,887 --> 00:38:40,162
so you will present the crown
to Lady Eleanor.

426
00:38:40,247 --> 00:38:41,726
You will go down on the right knee.

427
00:38:41,807 --> 00:38:45,516
Do not look in her eyes
when you tell her the King is no more.

428
00:38:45,607 --> 00:38:49,202
And do not rise until all others rise.
Do you understand?

429
00:38:49,287 --> 00:38:50,322
Yes.

430
00:39:01,607 --> 00:39:02,722
Agnes.

431
00:39:03,887 --> 00:39:05,445
My blue and gold brocade.

432
00:39:05,527 --> 00:39:06,596
Yes, My Lady.

433
00:39:27,567 --> 00:39:30,641
Part for the Queen.

434
00:39:54,647 --> 00:39:55,762
Cease.

435
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:18,160
What's this? What's happening?

436
00:40:18,247 --> 00:40:20,363
King Richard returns from France, My Lord.

437
00:40:24,927 --> 00:40:26,724
Did Loxley deceive us?

438
00:41:00,447 --> 00:41:01,516
Kneel.

439
00:41:07,847 --> 00:41:09,439
Long life, my son.

440
00:41:10,967 --> 00:41:12,195
Rise now.

441
00:41:15,007 --> 00:41:17,646
A king is dead.

442
00:41:18,647 --> 00:41:21,036
Long live the King.

443
00:41:22,607 --> 00:41:24,563
Long live the King!

444
00:41:25,167 --> 00:41:27,044
- Long live the King!
- Long live the King!

445
00:41:27,447 --> 00:41:29,119
- Long live the King!
- Long live the King!

446
00:41:29,847 --> 00:41:30,882
Rise.

447
00:41:35,847 --> 00:41:36,962
You...

448
00:41:38,527 --> 00:41:40,085
I don't know you.

449
00:41:40,727 --> 00:41:43,287
Robert Loxley, Sire, of Nottingham.

450
00:41:44,247 --> 00:41:45,680
Welcome then.

451
00:41:46,527 --> 00:41:48,563
And how did my brother die?

452
00:41:49,847 --> 00:41:51,917
In battle, Your Majesty, as was his way.

453
00:41:53,167 --> 00:41:54,486
As was his way.

454
00:41:55,287 --> 00:41:56,402
You deserve a reward...

455
00:41:56,487 --> 00:41:57,476
Let's get the horses.

456
00:41:57,567 --> 00:41:58,966
For bringing home the news.

457
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,202
Kneel.

458
00:42:09,087 --> 00:42:10,759
Did you say you were from Nottingham?

459
00:42:12,127 --> 00:42:13,196
Yes.

460
00:42:15,727 --> 00:42:17,797
Your father, Sir Walter,

461
00:42:19,207 --> 00:42:21,004
owes tax to the crown.

462
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:25,361
My crown.

463
00:42:25,447 --> 00:42:27,677
Tell him it's bloody expensive
running a country

464
00:42:27,767 --> 00:42:29,598
and everyone's got to pay their way.

465
00:42:30,167 --> 00:42:31,441
We'll start with this.

466
00:42:33,567 --> 00:42:35,364
Make way for the King!

467
00:42:36,007 --> 00:42:36,996
Make way!

468
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:38,156
Your Majesty.

469
00:42:38,247 --> 00:42:40,044
Make way for the King!

470
00:42:45,287 --> 00:42:46,959
- Make way!
- Godfrey.

471
00:42:47,807 --> 00:42:50,367
Godfrey, my friend. It's so good to see you.

472
00:42:50,927 --> 00:42:52,758
- How were your travels?
- Good, Sire.

473
00:42:53,927 --> 00:42:55,042
What happened to your face?

474
00:42:56,247 --> 00:42:57,885
A hunting accident. It's nothing.

475
00:42:59,247 --> 00:43:00,885
- Frightening.
- Your Majesty.

476
00:43:00,967 --> 00:43:04,277
Call it a duelling scar.
The ladies will love you all the more.

477
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:07,157
I bow to your knowledge of the ladies, Sire.

478
00:43:11,407 --> 00:43:13,045
You can get up now.

479
00:43:21,207 --> 00:43:22,526
Sir Robert.

480
00:43:26,807 --> 00:43:30,117
You will know of me, perhaps.
I'm William Marshal.

481
00:43:31,327 --> 00:43:34,046
Your father and I were young men together.

482
00:43:34,447 --> 00:43:38,156
Tell him I'm coming to visit him soon,
on spring's first black night.

483
00:43:40,207 --> 00:43:42,004
I may have need of him.

484
00:43:42,367 --> 00:43:44,164
I will. I'll tell him.

485
00:43:46,767 --> 00:43:50,043
Whoever he is and whatever he is,
he knows too much.

486
00:43:52,887 --> 00:43:54,366
Get rid of him.

487
00:44:07,007 --> 00:44:08,804
Come on, let's follow.

488
00:45:09,407 --> 00:45:11,045
Forfeit what you got.

489
00:45:11,127 --> 00:45:14,039
Victuals, coin, clothing

490
00:45:14,167 --> 00:45:15,566
or your life.

491
00:45:17,367 --> 00:45:19,801
Thomas Cooper.

492
00:45:20,567 --> 00:45:21,886
Is that you?

493
00:45:26,007 --> 00:45:27,759
Are you sick, Thomas?

494
00:45:28,567 --> 00:45:30,000
We're all sick.

495
00:45:31,087 --> 00:45:33,840
- Where are the rest of you?
- Don't... Don't tell her.

496
00:45:33,927 --> 00:45:35,280
Loop will be angry.

497
00:45:35,367 --> 00:45:37,119
No, it's your mother
who's going to be angry.

498
00:45:37,207 --> 00:45:41,041
Now, either you come with me,
or I come with you.

499
00:45:41,127 --> 00:45:42,446
You choose.

500
00:45:43,607 --> 00:45:45,996
Well, come on then. Where are they?

501
00:45:47,247 --> 00:45:48,521
Answer me.

502
00:46:35,327 --> 00:46:37,887
Four men, five horses, one grey.

503
00:46:38,287 --> 00:46:40,437
- Have you seen them?
- That way.

504
00:46:46,767 --> 00:46:50,680
<i>The living king of sermons</i>

505
00:46:50,767 --> 00:46:53,235
<i>Was delivered from his evil</i>

506
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:57,040
<i>But he couldn't talk his last</i>

507
00:46:57,127 --> 00:46:59,322
<i>Because God took out his throat</i>

508
00:47:00,447 --> 00:47:03,837
<i>God's crossbow took out his throat</i>

509
00:47:03,927 --> 00:47:07,158
By Christ! Can you not sing a happy tune?

510
00:47:07,647 --> 00:47:13,005
Sing a foot-stomper about adventure
and daring and courage.

511
00:47:13,087 --> 00:47:16,443
No. Sing something about a woman.

512
00:47:17,447 --> 00:47:19,005
A large woman.

513
00:47:19,087 --> 00:47:22,602
<i>Fancy army, darling
I loves you all to bits</i>

514
00:47:22,687 --> 00:47:25,804
<i>I'll climb up to your chamber
And under your mountainous...</i>

515
00:47:25,887 --> 00:47:28,355
Right. I'm done. The money's divided.

516
00:47:29,207 --> 00:47:30,560
And so should we be.

517
00:47:31,087 --> 00:47:32,076
Where will you go?

518
00:47:34,847 --> 00:47:37,725
I think something is owed
for this good fortune,

519
00:47:37,807 --> 00:47:39,240
and I mean to pay it back.

520
00:47:39,327 --> 00:47:40,442
How so?

521
00:47:41,847 --> 00:47:44,919
The inscription on the sword,
it taunts my memory.

522
00:47:45,727 --> 00:47:48,560
Maybe it's just my imagination, I don't know.

523
00:47:49,007 --> 00:47:51,965
But I intend to take that sword
back to its owner

524
00:47:52,047 --> 00:47:53,719
and fulfil the request of his dying son.

525
00:47:53,807 --> 00:47:54,922
Are you mad?

526
00:47:55,447 --> 00:47:57,403
You just said we were in danger, Robin.

527
00:47:57,487 --> 00:48:00,285
Now you choose to step back
in to harm's way?

528
00:48:01,087 --> 00:48:03,203
They're bound to go there and find you.

529
00:48:03,287 --> 00:48:07,166
We can't repay our good luck
with bad grace. It invites darkness.

530
00:48:11,967 --> 00:48:13,605
- I'm going with you.
- And I, Robin.

531
00:48:14,047 --> 00:48:15,241
- Yes.
- No.

532
00:48:16,487 --> 00:48:18,478
Tonight is our last in company.

533
00:48:18,567 --> 00:48:21,400
Tomorrow, we go our separate ways.

534
00:48:23,007 --> 00:48:25,726
Pack up your share. We eat and sleep.

535
00:48:26,407 --> 00:48:28,716
Will, you're on first watch.

536
00:49:28,367 --> 00:49:29,356
Will.

537
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:00,040
Watch your step!

538
00:50:00,927 --> 00:50:01,962
One of them got away.

539
00:50:03,447 --> 00:50:05,881
Bastards! They've stolen my fortune.

540
00:50:07,287 --> 00:50:09,482
Richard's army is coming home.

541
00:50:09,567 --> 00:50:12,604
It costs money to keep it together.
Marshal, you speak for the money.

542
00:50:12,687 --> 00:50:13,802
I do, Sire.

543
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:17,197
But to disband the army
could cost more than to keep it.

544
00:50:20,367 --> 00:50:24,519
King Richard's campaigns were costly.
And the expected returns...

545
00:50:24,607 --> 00:50:26,757
What is that to me, Marshal?

546
00:50:27,487 --> 00:50:29,876
My brother's troubles are over!

547
00:50:31,087 --> 00:50:32,645
They're over!

548
00:50:34,807 --> 00:50:35,842
Clear the room.

549
00:50:47,487 --> 00:50:49,955
So... Taxation.

550
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,162
Taxation?

551
00:50:51,247 --> 00:50:55,445
Milking a dry udder gets you nothing
but kicked off the milking stool.

552
00:50:55,767 --> 00:50:57,564
Mother, spare me your farmyard memories.

553
00:50:57,647 --> 00:51:00,161
You have none,
and I don't understand them.

554
00:51:00,247 --> 00:51:01,919
These are difficult times.

555
00:51:02,207 --> 00:51:03,799
We can buy time.

556
00:51:03,887 --> 00:51:06,401
I can send envoys to secure loans.

557
00:51:06,527 --> 00:51:09,439
There are money chests from Sicily
to Normandy if you know where to look.

558
00:51:09,687 --> 00:51:11,325
Cap-in-hand to moneylenders?

559
00:51:11,807 --> 00:51:13,126
Your master's a king.

560
00:51:13,807 --> 00:51:16,037
The crown is owed money at home.

561
00:51:16,127 --> 00:51:20,166
The northern barons plead poverty,
but that's always been the song of rich men.

562
00:51:21,167 --> 00:51:22,964
So, what's to be done?

563
00:51:38,127 --> 00:51:41,039
Give me leave, Sire, to go north
with a company of mounted men.

564
00:51:41,487 --> 00:51:43,876
I'll have the merchants and landowners
fill your coffers

565
00:51:44,287 --> 00:51:45,845
or their coffins.

566
00:51:45,927 --> 00:51:48,202
Englishmen killing Englishmen.

567
00:51:48,287 --> 00:51:51,199
No man loyal to the crown
has anything to fear.

568
00:51:51,767 --> 00:51:56,557
And loyalty means paying your share
in the defence of the realm.

569
00:51:57,727 --> 00:51:59,160
That's well said.

570
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:01,765
Hmm? Don't you think, Marshal?

571
00:52:03,087 --> 00:52:04,202
Mother?

572
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:09,156
Richard commanded loyalty
not by threats but by example.

573
00:52:09,367 --> 00:52:12,279
Mother, your sainted son was an imbecile.

574
00:52:12,647 --> 00:52:17,516
And you supported his every folly
from here to Jerusalem and back.

575
00:52:18,167 --> 00:52:21,159
Yes, you worshipped him

576
00:52:21,247 --> 00:52:24,956
when the warrior lost territories
hard won by his father.

577
00:52:25,167 --> 00:52:27,158
You kissed his picture

578
00:52:27,247 --> 00:52:30,364
while England had to pay
four years' revenue

579
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:32,085
to ransom him when he was captured.

580
00:52:32,167 --> 00:52:34,522
You are just as much to blame as anyone

581
00:52:34,607 --> 00:52:37,246
for the wreckage which is my inheritance.

582
00:52:50,327 --> 00:52:52,921
I broke her skin more than she did mine.

583
00:53:00,167 --> 00:53:01,486
Chancellor.

584
00:53:07,487 --> 00:53:08,636
Marshal,

585
00:53:10,367 --> 00:53:13,837
you served my brother faithfully
and my father before him.

586
00:53:15,327 --> 00:53:18,080
I think you've spent enough time
with my family

587
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:20,641
and, no doubt,
would like to spend more with your own.

588
00:53:22,527 --> 00:53:24,836
Therefore, and with regret,

589
00:53:25,407 --> 00:53:28,638
I accept your resignation
of all your offices and matters of state.

590
00:53:31,927 --> 00:53:33,121
The ring.

591
00:53:40,847 --> 00:53:42,246
Your Majesty.

592
00:54:00,607 --> 00:54:04,122
Choose carefully, Godfrey, the spot
where you would place your dagger.

593
00:54:12,647 --> 00:54:15,081
For I will choose carefully, as well.

594
00:54:37,407 --> 00:54:38,886
Open the gates!

595
00:55:13,527 --> 00:55:14,846
Nottingham.

596
00:55:16,047 --> 00:55:18,720
- Is this your people, Robin?
- I don't know. Might be.

597
00:55:19,167 --> 00:55:22,398
They don't look much,
these Middle Englanders.

598
00:55:22,487 --> 00:55:25,047
Well, they've been keeping your lot
in place easy enough, haven't they?

599
00:55:25,127 --> 00:55:27,846
I hear that you Welsh boys,
you live on leeks.

600
00:55:28,207 --> 00:55:30,084
You co-habit with sheep.

601
00:55:32,567 --> 00:55:34,364
Bloody Scottish mule.

602
00:55:35,887 --> 00:55:39,197
You wouldn't want to annoy a bee hive
with your noise, would you?

603
00:55:39,287 --> 00:55:41,118
Your swords would be
no good then, gentlemen.

604
00:55:41,367 --> 00:55:42,402
You're the town beekeeper?

605
00:55:43,567 --> 00:55:46,320
Bless you, no. I'm the friar. Tuck's the name.

606
00:55:46,887 --> 00:55:50,163
Well, Friar Tuck, can you tell me
where I might find Sir Walter Loxley?

607
00:55:50,887 --> 00:55:52,605
If he's not up at Peper Harow...

608
00:55:55,087 --> 00:55:56,315
How long will your business take?

609
00:56:01,207 --> 00:56:02,196
Stay safe.

610
00:56:02,887 --> 00:56:04,115
God be with you all.

611
00:56:11,047 --> 00:56:12,116
That's it?

612
00:56:12,207 --> 00:56:13,560
After 10 years?

613
00:56:15,047 --> 00:56:17,880
Good Friar, where can a man get, well,

614
00:56:17,967 --> 00:56:19,923
moderately insensible
on a drink around here?

615
00:56:20,287 --> 00:56:23,324
Allan, he's a man of the cloth.
I'm sorry, Friar.

616
00:56:24,567 --> 00:56:26,683
- Have you coin?
- I have coin.

617
00:56:27,367 --> 00:56:28,686
Two pieces.

618
00:56:29,447 --> 00:56:30,516
Each.

619
00:56:31,647 --> 00:56:34,445
Have you tried the honey liquor
we call mead?

620
00:56:36,407 --> 00:56:37,806
Come with me.

621
00:56:38,447 --> 00:56:40,597
Gives a man a halo, does mead.

622
00:57:11,007 --> 00:57:11,996
Girl.

623
00:57:12,087 --> 00:57:13,998
Girl?

624
00:57:18,367 --> 00:57:21,120
Either you're going blind
or you're looking for charity.

625
00:57:21,567 --> 00:57:23,478
Are you the keeper of this house?

626
00:57:23,567 --> 00:57:25,637
In a manner of speaking, yes.

627
00:57:26,047 --> 00:57:27,765
I wish to see Sir Walter Loxley.

628
00:57:30,047 --> 00:57:31,116
And you are?

629
00:57:31,447 --> 00:57:32,641
Robin Longstride.

630
00:57:32,727 --> 00:57:34,604
Plain Robin Longstride? No Sir?

631
00:57:35,087 --> 00:57:37,078
No, ma'am. No Sir.

632
00:57:40,647 --> 00:57:41,966
Are you here about the tax?

633
00:57:42,847 --> 00:57:46,999
No, I'm here to bring him his sword.
His son's dead.

634
00:57:49,127 --> 00:57:50,355
This way.

635
00:58:11,367 --> 00:58:13,164
He'll take your horse.

636
00:58:24,607 --> 00:58:25,756
Marion!

637
00:58:26,447 --> 00:58:27,596
Marion!

638
00:58:27,847 --> 00:58:29,963
Maggie, where is she?

639
00:58:31,167 --> 00:58:32,646
Ma'am, Sir Walter calls for you.

640
00:58:32,727 --> 00:58:35,036
I know, Margaret. I can hear him.

641
00:58:35,527 --> 00:58:37,438
Tell him we have a guest.

642
00:58:46,407 --> 00:58:49,717
I'm Marion Loxley. Robert's wife.

643
00:58:53,807 --> 00:58:56,685
My Lady, I owe you an apology.
If I'd have known...

644
00:58:56,767 --> 00:58:59,884
Bad news is bad news
no matter how it comes.

645
00:59:01,127 --> 00:59:05,405
Indeed, I owe you thanks for taking the time
to deliver it here yourself.

646
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:08,556
Did you fight alongside my husband?

647
00:59:10,167 --> 00:59:11,202
Yes.

648
00:59:12,527 --> 00:59:13,676
Did he die well?

649
00:59:17,767 --> 00:59:19,041
In an ambush, ma'am.

650
00:59:19,287 --> 00:59:22,484
He was the man chosen
to bring home Richard's crown.

651
00:59:22,727 --> 00:59:24,683
Marion, who is here?

652
00:59:26,007 --> 00:59:27,679
A traveller, Walter.

653
00:59:33,007 --> 00:59:35,362
This news will go very hard on him.

654
00:59:35,447 --> 00:59:36,482
Bring him in.

655
00:59:36,567 --> 00:59:37,761
Yes, yes.

656
00:59:38,287 --> 00:59:41,359
Tell him Robert is in the Holy Land,
sends his love and will return soon.

657
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:44,675
Marion, our traveller will be thirsty.

658
00:59:45,287 --> 00:59:48,643
Travellers are always thirsty. Is that not so?

659
00:59:48,727 --> 00:59:49,796
Your name, sir?

660
00:59:50,847 --> 00:59:52,883
Longstride. Robin Longstride.

661
00:59:55,407 --> 00:59:56,476
Do you mock me?

662
00:59:58,287 --> 00:59:59,276
Sir?

663
01:00:00,527 --> 01:00:01,755
Your son,

664
01:00:03,447 --> 01:00:05,165
he asked me to bring you this.

665
01:00:13,447 --> 01:00:17,599
And how does Robert defend himself
if he has no sword?

666
01:00:19,167 --> 01:00:21,920
The prodigal son will not return after all.

667
01:00:24,487 --> 01:00:28,480
So, no tears, no forgiveness from his father.

668
01:00:32,567 --> 01:00:34,285
No amends to be made.

669
01:00:42,527 --> 01:00:44,199
Did you see him die?

670
01:00:46,447 --> 01:00:48,597
I was with him when he passed.

671
01:00:49,607 --> 01:00:52,440
His final words were for the love and bond
between a father and son.

672
01:00:53,527 --> 01:00:54,880
Forgive my rudeness.

673
01:00:56,407 --> 01:00:59,001
My grief has been waiting for this day.

674
01:01:00,167 --> 01:01:03,045
So come, so that I may see you.

675
01:01:17,847 --> 01:01:19,803
Robin Longstride.

676
01:01:20,967 --> 01:01:24,164
A common enough but noble Saxon name.

677
01:01:26,407 --> 01:01:29,240
So, you will dine with us.

678
01:01:30,567 --> 01:01:32,956
But first, you must bathe, sir.

679
01:01:33,407 --> 01:01:34,442
You stink.

680
01:01:41,087 --> 01:01:46,161
I've laid out some of my husband's clothes.
I hope you don't find that too discomforting.

681
01:01:47,487 --> 01:01:48,681
My Lady,

682
01:01:51,047 --> 01:01:52,639
I'll need some help with the chain mail.

683
01:01:54,767 --> 01:01:55,995
Winifred.

684
01:01:57,527 --> 01:01:58,721
Winifred.

685
01:02:06,967 --> 01:02:10,357
The coif has a clasp at the nape of the neck.

686
01:02:19,407 --> 01:02:23,241
If you take off the coif,
you'll find lacings in the back of the tabard.

687
01:02:58,447 --> 01:02:59,800
Thank you.

688
01:02:59,887 --> 01:03:01,559
I'll have it washed.

689
01:03:18,287 --> 01:03:19,879
Marion, more wine.

690
01:03:24,527 --> 01:03:27,439
You've taken a long road to bring this to me.

691
01:03:27,567 --> 01:03:30,798
I cannot decide
whether that makes you trustworthy...

692
01:03:30,887 --> 01:03:32,400
Or manipulative.

693
01:03:32,847 --> 01:03:37,841
Marion, I'm merely trying to gauge
the quality of the man we have as our guest.

694
01:03:38,287 --> 01:03:39,720
Is he handsome?

695
01:03:40,247 --> 01:03:41,316
Yes.

696
01:03:43,047 --> 01:03:46,835
In the way that yeomen sometimes are
when they are sober.

697
01:03:46,927 --> 01:03:49,680
Entertain us
with a tale of your life, sir.

698
01:03:50,287 --> 01:03:52,926
We don't get many visitors any more.

699
01:03:53,007 --> 01:03:55,601
Except tax collectors and other beggars.

700
01:03:56,367 --> 01:03:59,518
I don't know where I'm from.
Only know where I've been.

701
01:03:59,607 --> 01:04:02,804
So, Marion,
what colour are his eyes?

702
01:04:07,727 --> 01:04:09,285
I don't yet know.

703
01:04:10,007 --> 01:04:14,444
I have a proposal for you, young man.

704
01:04:16,007 --> 01:04:18,919
You brought me this sword,
which has great meaning.

705
01:04:19,087 --> 01:04:20,839
If you give me your time,

706
01:04:21,887 --> 01:04:23,161
it is yours.

707
01:04:24,767 --> 01:04:27,804
I could stay for a day, or more.

708
01:04:30,407 --> 01:04:33,877
- I have a question to ask you.
And what is your question?

709
01:04:33,967 --> 01:04:36,845
The words on the hilt of the sword,
what do they mean?

710
01:04:37,767 --> 01:04:42,443
Well, I think I have much to tell you
about history. About your history.

711
01:04:49,327 --> 01:04:50,601
That's very kind.

712
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:53,724
Well, you haven't heard the other half
of my proposal yet.

713
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:57,641
I want you to stay in Nottingham
and, for the time being,

714
01:04:57,727 --> 01:05:01,640
become my returned son,
and therefore Marion's spouse.

715
01:05:01,767 --> 01:05:02,916
Oh, that's enough!

716
01:05:03,007 --> 01:05:04,520
- You've had too much to drink.
- Listen. Listen. Listen.

717
01:05:04,607 --> 01:05:08,725
We both know that without a husband
you will lose this land when I die.

718
01:05:09,087 --> 01:05:11,203
Do you dispute that? Hmm?

719
01:05:11,287 --> 01:05:13,881
- No.
- No, so if I say this is my son,

720
01:05:13,967 --> 01:05:19,405
he will be seen as that.
And, so, as your husband. Huh?

721
01:05:19,487 --> 01:05:21,125
It is a fair contract.

722
01:05:21,327 --> 01:05:25,240
It is not as if I expect you
to have children or...

723
01:05:25,967 --> 01:05:29,960
No, the sword for your time, Longstride.

724
01:05:30,407 --> 01:05:31,601
Are you in agreement?

725
01:05:33,167 --> 01:05:35,886
- Yes.
Marion, go tell the staff

726
01:05:36,167 --> 01:05:40,206
that my son has arrived
and our home is now whole again.

727
01:05:41,167 --> 01:05:43,806
Tell them to ring the church bells
in celebration.

728
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:46,404
And more wine, please.

729
01:05:56,367 --> 01:05:57,959
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

730
01:06:02,887 --> 01:06:04,206
<i>I rose up in the morning</i>

731
01:06:04,287 --> 01:06:06,403
<i>And I felt a dire need</i>

732
01:06:06,487 --> 01:06:09,843
<i>To dream away the dreary day
and down a cup of mead</i>

733
01:06:09,927 --> 01:06:11,883
<i>I felt the sting of honeybees</i>

734
01:06:12,327 --> 01:06:13,601
Home brew.

735
01:06:14,887 --> 01:06:19,085
If I wasn't the village priest,
I'd try for the village drunkard.

736
01:06:21,247 --> 01:06:22,236
Oh, great.

737
01:06:23,247 --> 01:06:25,602
A man could get
very affectionate here.

738
01:06:25,687 --> 01:06:30,920
I haven't seen so many women
for so few men outside a nunnery.

739
01:06:31,607 --> 01:06:35,885
The secret to success
is never go for the prettiest one.

740
01:06:36,687 --> 01:06:38,757
Start with the homely one on the left.

741
01:06:42,607 --> 01:06:43,722
Right there.

742
01:06:44,087 --> 01:06:47,079
She's about my size.
I'm going to make her smile.

743
01:06:48,007 --> 01:06:50,282
I'm going to make you smile!

744
01:06:50,767 --> 01:06:51,802
Come over here!

745
01:06:51,967 --> 01:06:54,765
So, why do they call you Little John?

746
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:56,075
What are you trying to get at?

747
01:06:57,087 --> 01:06:58,236
I'm proportionate.

748
01:06:58,327 --> 01:07:01,239
<i>So roll another barrel to the bar</i>

749
01:07:01,327 --> 01:07:04,876
<i>And pour another cup or two
so I can soak my heart</i>

750
01:07:51,927 --> 01:07:53,121
Stop it.

751
01:07:56,367 --> 01:07:57,686
What did I tell you?

752
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:09,601
It seems we are to share my chamber.

753
01:08:10,527 --> 01:08:13,280
A ruse to convince the servants.

754
01:08:14,087 --> 01:08:16,999
Well, if the aim is deception,

755
01:08:17,527 --> 01:08:22,681
should you not be addressing me as
"My husband," or, "My dear"?

756
01:08:23,407 --> 01:08:25,762
Don't be ridiculous.

757
01:08:29,687 --> 01:08:31,723
Well, are you coming or not?

758
01:08:35,487 --> 01:08:36,681
Ask me nicely.

759
01:08:44,327 --> 01:08:47,922
Please, dear husband,
will you share my chamber?

760
01:09:23,247 --> 01:09:24,236
Here.

761
01:09:28,087 --> 01:09:29,805
I sleep with a dagger.

762
01:09:29,887 --> 01:09:33,641
If you so much as move to touch me,
I will sever your manhood.

763
01:09:33,727 --> 01:09:34,921
You understand?

764
01:09:35,247 --> 01:09:36,236
Thanks for the warning.

765
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:44,081
Hello, dogs.

766
01:11:35,127 --> 01:11:36,276
Godfrey.

767
01:11:46,447 --> 01:11:48,085
Where are your men?

768
01:11:49,047 --> 01:11:50,241
They're dead, My Lord.

769
01:11:51,327 --> 01:11:52,396
And Loxley?

770
01:11:52,687 --> 01:11:53,802
Alive.

771
01:11:57,327 --> 01:11:58,646
Then fate has left him to me.

772
01:12:10,487 --> 01:12:14,321
I hear a man's steps. Good morning, my son.

773
01:12:15,127 --> 01:12:16,446
Morning, Walter.

774
01:12:17,647 --> 01:12:18,682
Father.

775
01:12:19,047 --> 01:12:20,241
Father.

776
01:12:20,927 --> 01:12:23,202
So what is it that you know of my history?

777
01:12:23,287 --> 01:12:24,515
Patience.

778
01:12:24,927 --> 01:12:28,442
You must show yourself today.
Wear your sword.

779
01:12:29,927 --> 01:12:30,837
Marion.

780
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:33,041
I'm here, Walter.

781
01:12:33,127 --> 01:12:36,915
Reacquaint your husband
with his village and his people.

782
01:12:38,727 --> 01:12:40,922
I'll see to the horses.

783
01:12:41,207 --> 01:12:42,640
I feel invigorated.

784
01:12:42,807 --> 01:12:46,083
I woke this morning with a tumescent glow.

785
01:12:46,727 --> 01:12:47,876
Eighty-four.

786
01:12:48,647 --> 01:12:49,966
A miracle.

787
01:12:51,487 --> 01:12:54,957
I've always wondered
at the private conversations of men.

788
01:12:55,727 --> 01:12:56,955
Husband.

789
01:13:16,487 --> 01:13:18,239
This is rich country.

790
01:13:18,807 --> 01:13:20,718
Where's your cattle and your sheep?

791
01:13:20,807 --> 01:13:24,561
Sold, eaten, stolen, traded.
We've had seven lean years.

792
01:13:25,087 --> 01:13:27,362
Our meat now is rabbit

793
01:13:27,447 --> 01:13:30,007
or wild pig on a lucky day.

794
01:13:30,087 --> 01:13:31,315
And deer?

795
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:35,401
If you're willing to risk your neck
to the King's executioner.

796
01:13:35,767 --> 01:13:38,327
Every deer in the land
belongs to His Majesty.

797
01:13:38,407 --> 01:13:41,046
These things are God's gifts first
before the King's possessions.

798
01:13:41,647 --> 01:13:45,276
If it's illegal for a man to fend for himself

799
01:13:45,367 --> 01:13:47,164
how then can he be a man in his own right?

800
01:13:47,247 --> 01:13:49,044
Welcome home, sir.

801
01:13:49,127 --> 01:13:52,164
Sir Robert.
Good morning, Joseph. Emma.

802
01:13:53,687 --> 01:13:57,475
Sir Walter is our Lord, and you
are Robert returned and you should act so.

803
01:14:00,087 --> 01:14:02,282
Sir Robert. You remember me?

804
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:04,756
Tom Chamberlain. Pig farmer.

805
01:14:05,087 --> 01:14:06,566
You don't look a day older, Tom.

806
01:14:07,527 --> 01:14:08,846
Sir Robert.

807
01:14:09,447 --> 01:14:11,642
When will our young lads come back to us?

808
01:14:12,207 --> 01:14:15,005
Will you find my Jamie,
tell him to come home?

809
01:14:17,687 --> 01:14:21,362
With no work and little food,
the village boys have gone.

810
01:14:21,447 --> 01:14:23,722
- To be soldiers?
- Poachers.

811
01:14:28,887 --> 01:14:30,240
Look at that, mate.

812
01:14:33,167 --> 01:14:34,805
Still here then?

813
01:14:36,687 --> 01:14:40,600
For the time being, refer to me as Sir Robert.
I'll explain later.

814
01:14:41,007 --> 01:14:44,682
My men-at-arms.
This is about as courtly as they get.

815
01:14:45,087 --> 01:14:48,363
Allan A'Dayle, Will Scarlet and Little John.

816
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:49,516
Lady Marion.

817
01:14:56,047 --> 01:14:58,959
I trust you had an historic evening.

818
01:14:59,447 --> 01:15:00,562
For sure.

819
01:15:04,967 --> 01:15:08,084
Lady Marion Loxley. My wife.

820
01:15:08,847 --> 01:15:10,246
Well played.

821
01:15:10,767 --> 01:15:13,964
A bit rash but well played nonetheless.

822
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:15,560
Right you are, Robin.

823
01:15:15,767 --> 01:15:16,995
Sir Robert.

824
01:15:17,087 --> 01:15:18,600
- Sir Robert.
- Sir...

825
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:20,885
- Sir.
- Sir.

826
01:15:20,967 --> 01:15:22,559
- Sir Bob.
- Sir Robert.

827
01:15:29,567 --> 01:15:30,795
Friar.

828
01:15:32,287 --> 01:15:36,758
Ah, Marion. Good news travels
from Peper Harow this morning.

829
01:15:37,527 --> 01:15:39,916
Sir Robert, nice to see you again.

830
01:15:40,007 --> 01:15:43,556
You should've made yourself known
when we met in the field. Welcome home.

831
01:15:44,247 --> 01:15:46,807
Yes, I should've. Forgive me, Friar.

832
01:15:47,967 --> 01:15:49,366
What happens here?

833
01:15:49,447 --> 01:15:51,802
We're moving
the Church's grain to York.

834
01:15:51,887 --> 01:15:53,559
Politics out of London, I hear.

835
01:15:53,647 --> 01:15:56,480
This is our grain. It belongs in this soil.

836
01:15:56,567 --> 01:15:59,445
Lady Marion, I but follow the orders
of my superiors

837
01:15:59,527 --> 01:16:01,836
and abide by their saying and rule.

838
01:16:06,647 --> 01:16:09,036
Does His Holiness
know about your wealth of honey?

839
01:16:10,927 --> 01:16:14,966
There are wolves in York, Sir Robert.
Voracious wolves.

840
01:16:16,327 --> 01:16:17,965
The bees are my family.

841
01:16:18,367 --> 01:16:20,437
I'm a procreator by design.

842
01:16:21,127 --> 01:16:23,766
I'm not a churchy friar. Never was.

843
01:16:24,567 --> 01:16:26,285
My bees give life.

844
01:16:26,967 --> 01:16:28,639
They are my life, Sir Robert.

845
01:16:28,727 --> 01:16:30,524
Should not the Bishop be told

846
01:16:30,647 --> 01:16:33,684
so the clergy can spread
Nottingham honey on Nottingham bread?

847
01:16:36,847 --> 01:16:39,600
What if the grain were not to reach York?

848
01:16:41,007 --> 01:16:44,238
Then the bees need not be spoken of.

849
01:16:52,967 --> 01:16:56,084
I was an old maid
when Robert courted me.

850
01:16:56,167 --> 01:17:00,319
I was a daughter of a respectable widow
with a thimbleful of noble blood.

851
01:17:00,727 --> 01:17:04,322
We were wed, and then a week later

852
01:17:04,727 --> 01:17:08,322
he left to join ship
for France and the Holy Lands.

853
01:17:08,407 --> 01:17:11,285
And that was my married life to a man

854
01:17:13,207 --> 01:17:14,845
I hardly knew.

855
01:17:17,767 --> 01:17:20,076
- A good knight.
- Short, but sweet.

856
01:17:21,127 --> 01:17:24,119
I mean, he was a good knight.

857
01:17:24,687 --> 01:17:26,598
A good knight-at-arms, a soldier.

858
01:17:26,687 --> 01:17:28,882
Oh, yes,
my knight-in-arms, even so.

859
01:17:28,967 --> 01:17:30,639
And I in his.

860
01:18:00,247 --> 01:18:02,602
Stop! You'll break its neck.

861
01:18:15,127 --> 01:18:16,321
Marion.

862
01:18:25,047 --> 01:18:26,116
Easy.

863
01:18:29,687 --> 01:18:30,836
I'm all right.

864
01:18:33,127 --> 01:18:34,845
I can't move me legs.

865
01:18:35,847 --> 01:18:37,166
I can't move me legs.

866
01:18:39,447 --> 01:18:40,641
Thank you.

867
01:18:43,767 --> 01:18:45,041
My Lord?

868
01:18:57,527 --> 01:18:59,245
Oh, is it my turn now?

869
01:19:08,087 --> 01:19:09,202
Thank you.

870
01:19:11,087 --> 01:19:13,521
Nicely done, sir.

871
01:19:13,607 --> 01:19:18,203
And to see Lady Marion Loxley's legs,
beyond my wildest hopes this morning.

872
01:19:20,327 --> 01:19:24,115
I don't believe you know my husband,

873
01:19:24,607 --> 01:19:25,596
Sir Robert.

874
01:19:25,687 --> 01:19:29,123
Allow me to introduce
the Sheriff of Nottingham.

875
01:19:29,207 --> 01:19:30,845
Welcome home, Sir Robert.

876
01:19:30,927 --> 01:19:34,636
You make your mark quickly
by rescuing the King's ram from drowning.

877
01:19:35,127 --> 01:19:36,116
What's this?

878
01:19:36,207 --> 01:19:40,280
What's mine in coin I have the right
to take in goods or livestock.

879
01:19:41,407 --> 01:19:43,159
If it's God's will.

880
01:19:46,607 --> 01:19:48,996
Here's a ram's worth of tax
for the Exchequer.

881
01:19:49,087 --> 01:19:53,365
Your insolence to Lady Marion,
I'll consider a debt between us.

882
01:20:18,287 --> 01:20:20,437
Mead and grain alcohol?

883
01:20:20,527 --> 01:20:22,722
I thought as much.

884
01:20:25,727 --> 01:20:27,797
There's something that we need to do.

885
01:20:27,887 --> 01:20:29,559
At your service.

886
01:20:41,607 --> 01:20:42,756
All right, lads.

887
01:20:42,847 --> 01:20:46,965
Should've left while you had the chance.
Something's afoot. Off we go.

888
01:21:01,927 --> 01:21:03,963
Stop. Stop the horses.

889
01:21:06,007 --> 01:21:09,522
You there! Move aside!
We're on Church business!

890
01:21:10,487 --> 01:21:12,318
None shall pass

891
01:21:12,407 --> 01:21:14,921
unless they can answer the riddle.

892
01:21:15,327 --> 01:21:17,079
Moon-mad!

893
01:21:17,167 --> 01:21:20,603
And what is the riddle, you insolent wretch?

894
01:21:21,407 --> 01:21:25,719
What has 18 legs and isn't going anywhere?

895
01:21:28,647 --> 01:21:30,877
Your next move will be your last.

896
01:21:32,087 --> 01:21:33,281
Evening, friend.

897
01:21:35,247 --> 01:21:37,556
I demand to know who you are.

898
01:21:38,047 --> 01:21:39,162
We are men of the hood.

899
01:21:41,687 --> 01:21:43,166
Merry now, at your expense.

900
01:21:44,567 --> 01:21:45,841
"The Lord taketh... ' '

901
01:21:45,927 --> 01:21:47,246
And we shall giveth back.

902
01:21:47,327 --> 01:21:49,716
My advice is to plant it now, by moonlight.

903
01:21:50,047 --> 01:21:51,082
Why is that, good friar?

904
01:21:51,167 --> 01:21:54,125
When it sprouts,
I can claim it as a miracle from God.

905
01:21:54,207 --> 01:21:57,085
The Church in York
would never deny a miracle.

906
01:22:01,087 --> 01:22:03,726
How much further?
About 11 miles.

907
01:22:52,047 --> 01:22:54,003
I thought you had left.

908
01:22:55,007 --> 01:22:57,077
The fields have been planted.

909
01:22:57,847 --> 01:22:59,803
I didn't want to wake you.

910
01:23:00,327 --> 01:23:01,919
How did you find the seed?

911
01:23:02,607 --> 01:23:04,882
If you have to ask, it's not a gift.

912
01:23:06,887 --> 01:23:08,286
Thank you.

913
01:23:52,087 --> 01:23:53,361
Pikemen, at the ready!

914
01:23:53,447 --> 01:23:54,721
Arms to ready!

915
01:23:55,287 --> 01:23:56,720
Prepare!

916
01:23:57,487 --> 01:23:59,876
This King John is no king of mine!

917
01:24:01,407 --> 01:24:04,126
You! Are you Baldwin? Open these gates!

918
01:24:04,207 --> 01:24:05,879
In whose name do you come against us?

919
01:24:05,967 --> 01:24:07,878
In the name of King John.

920
01:24:08,287 --> 01:24:10,721
Pay or burn.

921
01:24:10,807 --> 01:24:14,163
We have paid in money
and men for King Richard's wars!

922
01:24:14,367 --> 01:24:16,403
And we have no more to give!

923
01:24:16,527 --> 01:24:18,279
- Burn it.
- Archers!

924
01:24:37,527 --> 01:24:38,676
Come on.

925
01:24:50,207 --> 01:24:51,925
My Lord, this way!

926
01:24:56,087 --> 01:24:57,998
<i>In the name of John,</i>

927
01:24:58,087 --> 01:25:01,124
<i>by the Grace of God, King of England,</i>

928
01:25:01,207 --> 01:25:06,486
<i>let it be known to all who abide here
that a tax is warranted!</i>

929
01:25:11,967 --> 01:25:15,118
<i>Those persons
refusing to abide by the law</i>

930
01:25:15,207 --> 01:25:18,483
<i>will hereby be subject
to severe punishment.</i>

931
01:25:23,167 --> 01:25:26,045
<i>By order of His Majesty, King John.</i>

932
01:25:37,087 --> 01:25:38,361
Father Tancred!

933
01:25:55,287 --> 01:25:56,561
Your Majesty.

934
01:25:59,807 --> 01:26:01,320
Your Majesty.

935
01:26:04,127 --> 01:26:06,766
I have lost the confidence of King John,

936
01:26:07,167 --> 01:26:08,885
but he may still listen to you.

937
01:26:08,967 --> 01:26:11,322
Allow me to know better, William.

938
01:26:11,567 --> 01:26:13,797
You are much wiser than your owl.

939
01:26:13,887 --> 01:26:16,879
I dare say. I've lived longer.

940
01:26:18,167 --> 01:26:19,805
Edward, take him.

941
01:26:19,887 --> 01:26:20,876
Your Majesty.

942
01:26:24,247 --> 01:26:27,444
John is no Richard, alas, Your Majesty.

943
01:26:29,527 --> 01:26:33,998
But I serve the throne,
and the throne will endure.

944
01:26:36,567 --> 01:26:39,445
Speak plainly, Marshal.
What's troubling you?

945
01:26:40,127 --> 01:26:42,038
The crown is in peril.

946
01:26:43,207 --> 01:26:46,324
Godfrey has been plotting
with Philip of France.

947
01:26:47,327 --> 01:26:49,283
French troops have already landed
on our shores,

948
01:26:49,367 --> 01:26:51,961
and they are murdering Englishmen
in the name of King John.

949
01:26:52,807 --> 01:26:56,641
The northern barons
will make civil war against the throne.

950
01:26:56,887 --> 01:27:00,084
Leaving our coast defenceless
against the invasion

951
01:27:00,767 --> 01:27:02,723
which is certainly coming.

952
01:27:05,047 --> 01:27:09,837
So it's left to John's mother to scold him
like a child and point him to his duty.

953
01:27:15,447 --> 01:27:19,804
My son has an enemy in his court
closer to him than any friend.

954
01:27:19,927 --> 01:27:23,317
An English traitor. A paid agent of France.

955
01:27:24,447 --> 01:27:27,359
Why are you telling me
when you must tell the King?

956
01:27:27,447 --> 01:27:28,800
Isabella!

957
01:27:29,847 --> 01:27:31,963
It is you who must do that.

958
01:27:32,527 --> 01:27:36,486
Tell King John that you've had word
from France, from Philip himself, if you like.

959
01:27:36,567 --> 01:27:39,604
Why not tell him the truth?
That William Marshal...

960
01:27:39,687 --> 01:27:44,158
Oh! A mother he mistrusts
bearing the word of a man in dishonour?

961
01:27:44,247 --> 01:27:45,316
No.

962
01:27:46,167 --> 01:27:50,365
If you wish to be queen,
you must save John.

963
01:27:51,847 --> 01:27:53,200
And England.

964
01:27:54,607 --> 01:27:55,756
No!

965
01:27:56,607 --> 01:27:58,325
No! No!

966
01:28:01,167 --> 01:28:03,965
Godfrey! The bloody Judas!

967
01:28:04,687 --> 01:28:07,201
By the bowels of Christ, it's a lie.

968
01:28:07,287 --> 01:28:09,005
You lie!

969
01:28:26,967 --> 01:28:29,037
I'm sorry, my love.

970
01:28:44,367 --> 01:28:46,278
- Sheriff.
- Up there.

971
01:28:50,047 --> 01:28:53,119
Man won't give his name.
Demands audience with the sheriff.

972
01:28:53,647 --> 01:28:54,921
Demands?

973
01:28:57,727 --> 01:28:59,718
- Go away.
- My Lord.

974
01:29:21,007 --> 01:29:23,567
Tax collections proceed apace.

975
01:29:24,487 --> 01:29:26,205
Nottingham's turn is coming.

976
01:29:26,527 --> 01:29:28,404
Good. Good.

977
01:29:28,607 --> 01:29:32,202
Tell Sir Godfrey
that the Sheriff of Nottingham is his man.

978
01:29:32,287 --> 01:29:34,926
May he put his stamp on my authority.

979
01:29:35,007 --> 01:29:39,558
I see trouble
coming from Loxley of Peper Harow.

980
01:29:40,127 --> 01:29:41,879
A blind old man gives you trouble?

981
01:29:41,967 --> 01:29:44,037
Aye, and his son will give more.

982
01:29:44,207 --> 01:29:48,246
The crusader, Robert Loxley,
has returned this past week.

983
01:30:24,287 --> 01:30:25,436
Marion.

984
01:31:26,567 --> 01:31:28,558
Go on! Go on.

985
01:31:33,807 --> 01:31:35,320
Has he spoken yet?

986
01:31:35,527 --> 01:31:36,642
He was spying, Loop.

987
01:31:37,087 --> 01:31:38,406
Spying?

988
01:31:39,887 --> 01:31:42,242
Robert, I'm ashamed of you.

989
01:31:42,687 --> 01:31:43,961
Hello, Marion.

990
01:31:44,367 --> 01:31:45,766
I've come to save you.

991
01:31:46,967 --> 01:31:48,036
Know him?

992
01:31:48,687 --> 01:31:53,124
Boys, this is Sir Robert Loxley, my husband.

993
01:31:53,567 --> 01:31:56,559
Sir Robert, the runaways of Sherwood.

994
01:31:57,487 --> 01:31:58,761
Untie him.

995
01:31:58,847 --> 01:32:02,476
No, I don't think spies should be let off
so easily.

996
01:32:03,047 --> 01:32:04,366
That was unkind.

997
01:32:04,447 --> 01:32:06,165
You were a crusader?

998
01:32:06,287 --> 01:32:07,322
Yes.

999
01:32:07,407 --> 01:32:10,240
Did you hear that, boys?
You bested a crusader.

1000
01:32:11,567 --> 01:32:13,762
- My men are good fighters.
- I don't know about that.

1001
01:32:13,847 --> 01:32:16,156
I think the weight of numbers
might have been in their favour.

1002
01:32:16,247 --> 01:32:18,841
But they do move silently
like the creatures of the forest.

1003
01:32:18,927 --> 01:32:20,963
But that's only a skill if you stay as a man.

1004
01:32:21,047 --> 01:32:23,038
You don't become the creatures you hunt.

1005
01:32:23,127 --> 01:32:25,322
- We're soldiers.
No, you're not.

1006
01:32:25,487 --> 01:32:28,399
Soldiers fight for a cause. What's yours?

1007
01:32:30,567 --> 01:32:33,400
You don't have one.
That makes you poachers.

1008
01:32:34,687 --> 01:32:37,918
Common thieves with a lot to learn.

1009
01:32:38,007 --> 01:32:39,042
Like what?

1010
01:32:39,127 --> 01:32:41,277
I could teach you how to tie knots.

1011
01:32:41,367 --> 01:32:44,120
I could teach you which wood to get
to make your bows stronger.

1012
01:32:44,207 --> 01:32:48,246
I could teach you how to make arrows
that fly more than 20 feet.

1013
01:32:48,647 --> 01:32:51,844
And I can help Marion to teach you
how to stay clean

1014
01:32:52,007 --> 01:32:53,884
so you won't get sick.

1015
01:32:54,327 --> 01:32:58,764
I don't know who you're fighting, son,
but it's not me. I'm not your enemy.

1016
01:32:59,647 --> 01:33:02,605
If you want to chat,
you know where to find me.

1017
01:33:16,287 --> 01:33:17,356
Wife?

1018
01:33:24,687 --> 01:33:26,120
Marshal.

1019
01:33:26,687 --> 01:33:28,962
Stand aside! Make way for the King!

1020
01:33:29,047 --> 01:33:30,480
Your Majesty.

1021
01:33:32,207 --> 01:33:35,040
What the devil are you doing here? Hmm?

1022
01:33:35,127 --> 01:33:36,162
Sire?

1023
01:33:36,247 --> 01:33:38,966
Will you keep that animal still?
What's it got, palsy?

1024
01:33:41,367 --> 01:33:43,358
Do you think I haven't noticed
how you've deserted me?

1025
01:33:43,447 --> 01:33:45,756
If Your Majesty recalls,
our last conversation...

1026
01:33:45,847 --> 01:33:47,200
At our last conversation,

1027
01:33:47,287 --> 01:33:50,404
Philip of France wasn't coming our way
with an invasion fleet.

1028
01:33:51,047 --> 01:33:52,719
Was he, Marshal?

1029
01:33:56,327 --> 01:33:58,079
My friend Godfrey

1030
01:33:58,967 --> 01:34:01,686
is not the friend I thought he was.

1031
01:34:02,447 --> 01:34:05,086
He's stirred up
the northern barons against me.

1032
01:34:05,607 --> 01:34:07,837
They come south with an army.

1033
01:34:09,447 --> 01:34:11,756
Marshal, how dare they? How dare they?

1034
01:34:11,847 --> 01:34:14,566
Sire, forgotten men are dangerous men.

1035
01:34:16,647 --> 01:34:19,115
<i>The barons need to be told</i>

1036
01:34:19,687 --> 01:34:22,963
<i>that when the French come,
we are all Englishmen.</i>

1037
01:34:24,007 --> 01:34:26,157
- Fitzrobert.
- Baldwin.

1038
01:34:27,167 --> 01:34:30,364
We'll make an army of the north
and march on London.

1039
01:34:30,927 --> 01:34:32,963
The barons need leadership.

1040
01:34:33,247 --> 01:34:37,001
Wiser kings know
they must let men look them in the eye,

1041
01:34:37,847 --> 01:34:39,644
hear their voice.

1042
01:34:40,287 --> 01:34:43,723
Together, let us ride north to meet them.

1043
01:34:46,407 --> 01:34:48,921
They march against their king, Marshal.

1044
01:34:51,167 --> 01:34:52,600
Their king.

1045
01:34:54,007 --> 01:34:57,841
We will meet them with the pikes
of our militia in their gizzards.

1046
01:34:58,487 --> 01:35:00,637
You have lost your touch, Marshal.

1047
01:35:02,807 --> 01:35:05,082
Perhaps we'll look to the barons
without you.

1048
01:35:15,807 --> 01:35:18,844
Saddle up with a spare horse.
I leave immediately.

1049
01:35:18,927 --> 01:35:20,406
I want to know where to find Godfrey.

1050
01:35:20,487 --> 01:35:21,715
My Lord.

1051
01:35:36,287 --> 01:35:38,755
- I found him, My Lord.
Where?

1052
01:35:38,847 --> 01:35:42,920
Nottingham.
In plain sight, living as Walter Loxley's son.

1053
01:35:48,567 --> 01:35:50,523
Then we go to Nottingham.

1054
01:35:51,007 --> 01:35:53,919
Take no prisoners.
Leave no stone un-scorched.

1055
01:35:57,207 --> 01:35:58,959
Take two men, four horses.

1056
01:35:59,047 --> 01:36:03,120
Ride hard for the coast, then on to Paris
and give a message to the King.

1057
01:36:20,127 --> 01:36:22,322
I'll make the place famous.

1058
01:36:25,687 --> 01:36:27,120
Come, Allan!

1059
01:36:27,207 --> 01:36:30,199
I'll get them drinking. You get them dancing!

1060
01:36:30,327 --> 01:36:31,316
All right.

1061
01:37:01,047 --> 01:37:05,962
Music, laughter,
the crackle of a bonfire and a roasting pig.

1062
01:37:06,247 --> 01:37:09,637
Life has returned.
You have returned it, Robin.

1063
01:39:04,927 --> 01:39:06,804
How did you know it was me?

1064
01:39:06,887 --> 01:39:10,323
Who else would sit by me uninvited

1065
01:39:11,087 --> 01:39:13,601
like a friend from the old days?

1066
01:39:14,127 --> 01:39:15,719
How are you, William?

1067
01:39:16,527 --> 01:39:19,246
I'm well and troubled.

1068
01:39:19,327 --> 01:39:21,682
Ah. And what brings you?

1069
01:39:21,967 --> 01:39:24,686
I'm riding on to Barnsdale tonight.

1070
01:39:24,847 --> 01:39:28,920
I've heard something of the barons' anger
against the crown's tax collector...

1071
01:39:29,007 --> 01:39:31,282
The anger has turned into action.

1072
01:39:31,447 --> 01:39:33,438
They assemble to march against the King.

1073
01:39:33,767 --> 01:39:36,042
You think you can persuade the barons
to turn back?

1074
01:39:36,127 --> 01:39:37,162
Turn back, no.

1075
01:39:38,287 --> 01:39:42,075
To join King John against a French invasion.

1076
01:39:43,247 --> 01:39:45,283
- A what?
- Help me, Walter.

1077
01:39:45,647 --> 01:39:47,478
I cannot go with you.

1078
01:39:48,407 --> 01:39:50,079
I cannot speak for this king.

1079
01:39:50,167 --> 01:39:51,680
He is the only king we have.

1080
01:39:51,767 --> 01:39:53,086
But not the only hope.

1081
01:39:54,127 --> 01:39:55,242
Explain.

1082
01:39:56,767 --> 01:39:58,917
- Marion.
- I'm here, Walter.

1083
01:39:59,247 --> 01:40:01,397
This is my old friend,
William Marshal.

1084
01:40:01,487 --> 01:40:03,876
Lady Marion Loxley, my son's wife.

1085
01:40:03,967 --> 01:40:06,686
Lady, I was glad to see Sir Robert
when he disembarked in London.

1086
01:40:06,767 --> 01:40:09,156
I think you know better, Marshal.

1087
01:40:09,247 --> 01:40:13,798
Sir William, I know,
would like to meet Robin Longstride again.

1088
01:40:24,527 --> 01:40:25,880
We've met before.

1089
01:40:25,967 --> 01:40:28,242
Yes, Sir, I know. In London.

1090
01:40:30,007 --> 01:40:32,316
No, when you were a child.

1091
01:40:34,127 --> 01:40:35,685
Hobby-horse age.

1092
01:40:36,407 --> 01:40:40,161
Sir Walter and I returned from the Holy Land
to fetch you home.

1093
01:40:40,687 --> 01:40:41,881
But you'd gone.

1094
01:40:41,967 --> 01:40:44,959
We had lost Thomas Longstride's son.

1095
01:40:47,407 --> 01:40:50,797
It was a wound that never healed.

1096
01:40:57,487 --> 01:41:00,365
You need to know what I know.

1097
01:41:01,327 --> 01:41:04,125
Your father was a stonemason.

1098
01:41:05,287 --> 01:41:07,198
Is that pleasing to you?

1099
01:41:09,327 --> 01:41:11,397
Yes. It is.

1100
01:41:12,087 --> 01:41:15,124
But he was more than that.
He was a visionary.

1101
01:41:15,847 --> 01:41:17,439
What did he see?

1102
01:41:18,007 --> 01:41:20,567
That kings have a need of their subjects

1103
01:41:20,647 --> 01:41:24,322
no less than their subjects
have need of kings.

1104
01:41:24,407 --> 01:41:25,999
A dangerous idea.

1105
01:41:26,567 --> 01:41:29,684
Your father was a philosopher.
He had a way of speaking

1106
01:41:29,767 --> 01:41:32,759
that took you by the ears and by the heart.

1107
01:41:33,167 --> 01:41:35,920
None of these things
can be written down, Robin.

1108
01:41:36,007 --> 01:41:38,646
You must commit them to your very soul.

1109
01:41:39,367 --> 01:41:41,119
This is the science of memory.

1110
01:41:41,607 --> 01:41:46,761
"Rise and rise again
until lambs become lions.' '

1111
01:41:49,127 --> 01:41:54,121
Finally, hundreds listened,
thousands, who took up his call

1112
01:41:54,367 --> 01:41:57,484
<i>for the rights of all ranks from baron to serf.</i>

1113
01:42:00,327 --> 01:42:01,919
"Rise and rise again

1114
01:42:04,087 --> 01:42:06,237
"until lambs become lions.' '

1115
01:42:11,127 --> 01:42:12,879
What happened to him?

1116
01:42:13,687 --> 01:42:15,325
Close your eyes.

1117
01:42:21,287 --> 01:42:25,326
<i>... foundation is set on
the rights of liberty for all people!</i>

1118
01:42:29,767 --> 01:42:33,043
Longstride, give up the charter
and their names!

1119
01:42:33,287 --> 01:42:34,720
<i>You were there.</i>

1120
01:42:35,047 --> 01:42:36,241
You saw it.

1121
01:42:39,367 --> 01:42:40,720
I will not.

1122
01:43:03,927 --> 01:43:05,246
Not dead.

1123
01:43:06,647 --> 01:43:07,875
Not now.

1124
01:43:10,647 --> 01:43:11,841
Not now.

1125
01:43:16,007 --> 01:43:19,556
Here is my copy
of the main contract.

1126
01:43:19,967 --> 01:43:23,357
This charter of rights
was written by your father.

1127
01:43:23,447 --> 01:43:27,281
And here are... There are the names
of all the barons that signed the charter.

1128
01:43:27,367 --> 01:43:30,598
Fitzrobert, Baldwin, Marshal and myself.

1129
01:43:31,127 --> 01:43:34,278
What he wanted
was a charter for every man...

1130
01:43:34,367 --> 01:43:36,801
- Wait there.
To have the same rights.

1131
01:43:36,887 --> 01:43:39,879
Sir Walter? A messenger for you.

1132
01:43:39,967 --> 01:43:41,446
Bring him in.

1133
01:43:42,087 --> 01:43:43,759
Step forward, sir.

1134
01:43:44,807 --> 01:43:47,196
- My Lord.
I'm listening.

1135
01:43:47,327 --> 01:43:49,477
Peterborough's been burned
by the King's men.

1136
01:43:50,007 --> 01:43:52,726
Fitzrobert gathers an army
to slay King John in London.

1137
01:43:52,807 --> 01:43:56,163
Marshal requests your presence
at counsel in Barnsdale.

1138
01:43:57,767 --> 01:43:59,997
Wait outside, will you?

1139
01:44:01,247 --> 01:44:03,556
Cometh the hour, cometh the man.

1140
01:44:04,687 --> 01:44:07,281
The time for pretence is over.

1141
01:44:08,527 --> 01:44:11,121
Now, hold me like a son.

1142
01:44:18,247 --> 01:44:19,236
Go.

1143
01:44:20,767 --> 01:44:23,565
Maggie. Where's my lady?

1144
01:44:23,687 --> 01:44:25,086
I could not find her, sir.

1145
01:44:50,047 --> 01:44:54,677
Whether we fight for our lives,
our family and our honour,

1146
01:44:54,767 --> 01:44:56,439
we must fight till the death.

1147
01:44:57,407 --> 01:45:00,126
You've spent too long in the palace, William.

1148
01:45:00,247 --> 01:45:03,444
Spending time in the palace
gives me perspective.

1149
01:45:04,527 --> 01:45:06,119
As we speak,

1150
01:45:07,167 --> 01:45:09,806
King Philip sails for our coast.

1151
01:45:10,807 --> 01:45:15,119
Godfrey and his marauders are French!

1152
01:45:16,727 --> 01:45:19,480
Every minute that we waste in disunity

1153
01:45:19,567 --> 01:45:22,684
brings closer the destruction of our country!

1154
01:45:23,127 --> 01:45:24,924
We have been bled

1155
01:45:25,527 --> 01:45:27,165
by the King long before Godfrey.

1156
01:45:28,367 --> 01:45:31,040
Go back to London and tell the King

1157
01:45:31,727 --> 01:45:35,322
that we will meet him
on a field of his choice.

1158
01:45:35,407 --> 01:45:36,726
Make way!

1159
01:45:36,807 --> 01:45:39,002
We will not fight
to save John's crown.

1160
01:45:39,967 --> 01:45:42,162
Rather let him bend the knee to us.

1161
01:45:43,167 --> 01:45:45,442
I'll give you more,
Sir Baldwin.

1162
01:45:46,847 --> 01:45:49,077
My breast for your sword point.

1163
01:45:50,727 --> 01:45:52,240
Use mine.

1164
01:45:56,207 --> 01:45:57,356
Go on.

1165
01:45:58,687 --> 01:45:59,961
No?

1166
01:46:00,327 --> 01:46:04,115
Oh, this is what you want, isn't it?
This is what he wants.

1167
01:46:04,207 --> 01:46:07,995
Fine, I'd rather give it to you
than have it taken by the French.

1168
01:46:08,927 --> 01:46:11,122
You mistake me, Sire.

1169
01:46:11,287 --> 01:46:14,996
I have no right and no ambition
to wear the crown.

1170
01:46:15,607 --> 01:46:17,996
But let the rightful wearer beware.

1171
01:46:18,407 --> 01:46:22,366
From now we will be subject only
to laws that we have a hand in making.

1172
01:46:22,447 --> 01:46:26,963
We are not sheep
to be made mutton of by your butchers.

1173
01:46:28,687 --> 01:46:32,202
Godfrey set himself to turn you against me.

1174
01:46:32,287 --> 01:46:35,324
Then he did more than was needed
to accomplish that.

1175
01:46:39,687 --> 01:46:41,757
A very important decision.

1176
01:46:42,567 --> 01:46:46,037
Don't you think that we've paid
too much taxes for far too long...

1177
01:47:51,167 --> 01:47:52,919
This is where I was born.

1178
01:48:06,487 --> 01:48:09,797
- What does it mean?
- It means never give up.

1179
01:48:11,207 --> 01:48:15,519
We will not be loyal to a crown
that robs and starves us!

1180
01:48:15,687 --> 01:48:18,963
The King must listen to what we have to say!

1181
01:48:19,047 --> 01:48:23,598
A king does not bargain for the loyalty
that every subject owes him.

1182
01:48:23,887 --> 01:48:28,244
Without loyalty there is no kingdom.
There is nothing.

1183
01:48:29,647 --> 01:48:31,717
I'm here to speak for Sir Walter Loxley.

1184
01:48:33,687 --> 01:48:35,757
Let the man speak.
Let him speak!

1185
01:48:36,847 --> 01:48:38,599
Speak! Speak!

1186
01:48:38,807 --> 01:48:40,877
Speak, if you must.

1187
01:48:42,447 --> 01:48:45,086
If you're trying to build for the future,

1188
01:48:45,767 --> 01:48:48,201
you must set your foundation strong.

1189
01:48:49,927 --> 01:48:54,205
The laws of this land
enslave people to its king,

1190
01:48:55,807 --> 01:48:59,925
a king who demands loyalty
but offers nothing in return.

1191
01:49:01,407 --> 01:49:04,160
I have marched from France

1192
01:49:04,247 --> 01:49:06,636
to Palestine and back.

1193
01:49:07,607 --> 01:49:08,926
And I know

1194
01:49:09,527 --> 01:49:12,564
in tyranny lies only failure.

1195
01:49:14,087 --> 01:49:16,521
You build a country
like you build a cathedral,

1196
01:49:16,607 --> 01:49:17,642
from the ground up.

1197
01:49:18,847 --> 01:49:20,883
Empower every man

1198
01:49:22,087 --> 01:49:23,918
and you will gain strength.

1199
01:49:24,007 --> 01:49:25,645
Hmm.

1200
01:49:25,727 --> 01:49:28,685
Well, who could object
to such reasonable words?

1201
01:49:31,007 --> 01:49:34,522
If Your Majesty were to offer justice,

1202
01:49:35,727 --> 01:49:38,082
justice in the form of a charter of liberties,

1203
01:49:38,647 --> 01:49:42,196
allowing every man to forage for his hearth,

1204
01:49:42,847 --> 01:49:46,522
to be safe from conviction without cause

1205
01:49:46,607 --> 01:49:48,245
or prison without charge,

1206
01:49:48,967 --> 01:49:53,040
to work, eat and live
on the sweat of his own brow

1207
01:49:53,927 --> 01:49:57,203
- and be as merry as he can...
- Sir, Godfrey's men are on to Nottingham.

1208
01:49:57,487 --> 01:50:00,240
...then that king would be great.

1209
01:50:00,727 --> 01:50:04,402
Not only would he receive
the loyalty of his people

1210
01:50:05,687 --> 01:50:07,405
but their love, as well.

1211
01:50:08,647 --> 01:50:11,081
So what would you have? Hmm?

1212
01:50:11,287 --> 01:50:12,959
Castle for every man?

1213
01:50:15,207 --> 01:50:17,243
Every Englishman's home is his castle.

1214
01:50:18,647 --> 01:50:21,286
What we would ask, Your Majesty,

1215
01:50:22,647 --> 01:50:24,080
is liberty.

1216
01:50:24,407 --> 01:50:26,443
Liberty by law!

1217
01:50:28,287 --> 01:50:30,562
Your Majesty, My Lords,

1218
01:50:31,247 --> 01:50:33,681
the French fleet is in the Channel.

1219
01:50:33,847 --> 01:50:38,637
Sire, you have a chance
to unify your subjects high and low.

1220
01:50:40,287 --> 01:50:42,198
It falls on your nod.

1221
01:50:42,647 --> 01:50:44,558
I only have to nod?

1222
01:50:48,447 --> 01:50:50,165
I can do better than that.

1223
01:50:52,487 --> 01:50:54,205
I give my word

1224
01:50:54,687 --> 01:50:57,679
that such a charter will be written.

1225
01:50:57,767 --> 01:51:01,043
On my mother's life, I swear it.

1226
01:51:05,847 --> 01:51:09,123
Godfrey makes for Nottingham.
I must stay with the King.

1227
01:51:09,207 --> 01:51:11,163
I will send Baldwin and Fitzrobert with you.

1228
01:51:11,247 --> 01:51:14,876
We will meet again at the White Horse
when you are finished.

1229
01:51:14,967 --> 01:51:17,845
Robin, your father was a great man.

1230
01:51:19,127 --> 01:51:21,277
And you are your father's son.

1231
01:51:31,767 --> 01:51:33,246
Maggie, who's at the house?

1232
01:51:34,847 --> 01:51:36,041
Long live the King!

1233
01:52:10,807 --> 01:52:11,876
Gentlemen.

1234
01:52:26,007 --> 01:52:27,998
I'm the Sheriff of Nottingham.

1235
01:52:32,887 --> 01:52:34,684
I'm French on my mother's side.

1236
01:52:55,007 --> 01:52:57,805
Sir Walter! Sir Walter!

1237
01:53:05,647 --> 01:53:06,875
Loxley!

1238
01:53:07,127 --> 01:53:08,719
Show yourself!

1239
01:53:10,767 --> 01:53:11,961
Loxley!

1240
01:53:14,807 --> 01:53:16,206
Who calls here?

1241
01:53:16,687 --> 01:53:18,564
I call for Robert Loxley.

1242
01:53:18,807 --> 01:53:20,684
My son is not here to answer you.

1243
01:53:20,767 --> 01:53:22,166
That is the truth.

1244
01:53:22,407 --> 01:53:24,159
Because he's dead in a French ditch.

1245
01:53:26,207 --> 01:53:27,686
And who are you, sir, to say so?

1246
01:53:29,327 --> 01:53:30,806
Who am I?

1247
01:53:39,047 --> 01:53:40,844
I'm the one who killed him.

1248
01:53:42,567 --> 01:53:44,239
Fight me if you dare.

1249
01:53:45,047 --> 01:53:46,446
Lord have mercy.

1250
01:54:32,887 --> 01:54:34,843
Leave it on the table. Leave it! Next!

1251
01:54:35,767 --> 01:54:37,359
Next! Come on!

1252
01:54:39,127 --> 01:54:40,719
- Name?
- Loxley.

1253
01:54:41,167 --> 01:54:42,680
Christian name?

1254
01:54:42,967 --> 01:54:44,320
Marion.

1255
01:54:45,127 --> 01:54:46,765
Land?

1256
01:54:46,927 --> 01:54:48,599
5,000 acres.

1257
01:54:49,607 --> 01:54:51,279
Lady Marion Loxley?

1258
01:54:51,967 --> 01:54:53,480
I am.

1259
01:55:21,487 --> 01:55:24,445
Gentlemen, enjoy!

1260
01:55:56,527 --> 01:55:58,518
No one should have 4,000 acres.

1261
01:55:58,607 --> 01:56:00,518
5,000 acres.

1262
01:57:34,727 --> 01:57:36,683
Baldwin! Fitzrobert!

1263
01:57:36,767 --> 01:57:39,235
Take the southern flank
and circle in from the west.

1264
01:57:39,727 --> 01:57:42,366
Will and Allan,
get on the rooftops and pick your targets.

1265
01:58:02,687 --> 01:58:04,040
Lady Marion.

1266
01:58:24,647 --> 01:58:25,682
Quickly.

1267
01:58:50,967 --> 01:58:52,366
Follow me.

1268
01:59:13,407 --> 01:59:17,480
Somebody, please take the baby!
Save the baby, please!

1269
01:59:26,527 --> 01:59:28,085
John, down!

1270
01:59:34,047 --> 01:59:35,196
It's all right.

1271
01:59:35,287 --> 01:59:36,402
Go around.

1272
01:59:36,487 --> 01:59:37,681
Stand back!

1273
01:59:39,407 --> 01:59:40,442
Make way!

1274
01:59:41,487 --> 01:59:45,446
Hurry. It's all right. It's all right.
Please, hurry! Hurry!

1275
01:59:56,647 --> 01:59:57,716
Sword!

1276
02:00:16,687 --> 02:00:18,678
Get down,
you bastard French dogs!

1277
02:01:06,887 --> 02:01:10,004
Where will King Philip land
and when?

1278
02:01:23,287 --> 02:01:25,164
This is my last arrow.

1279
02:01:26,967 --> 02:01:30,482
Dungeness! Dungeness. Two days.

1280
02:01:34,327 --> 02:01:36,761
There we have it. We have two days.

1281
02:02:59,847 --> 02:03:02,964
Once before I said goodbye
to a man going to war.

1282
02:03:03,247 --> 02:03:04,965
He never came back.

1283
02:03:10,647 --> 02:03:12,319
Ask me nicely.

1284
02:03:45,607 --> 02:03:47,006
I love you, Marion.

1285
02:06:05,767 --> 02:06:07,200
Longstride!

1286
02:06:36,887 --> 02:06:38,957
What news of Walter and Nottingham?

1287
02:06:39,847 --> 02:06:42,361
Sir Walter is dead. Godfrey's hand.

1288
02:06:42,447 --> 02:06:45,041
Gentlemen, we go to war.

1289
02:06:45,287 --> 02:06:48,643
It is my first time. I shall lead.

1290
02:06:48,727 --> 02:06:49,921
Forward!

1291
02:08:25,927 --> 02:08:27,599
That's a lot of French.

1292
02:08:29,767 --> 02:08:31,280
What's to be done?

1293
02:08:32,647 --> 02:08:34,126
Archers to the cliff top.

1294
02:08:34,687 --> 02:08:37,201
Cavalry to the beach. We'll await you there.

1295
02:08:37,607 --> 02:08:39,643
- With me!
- Archers!

1296
02:08:42,007 --> 02:08:43,725
Excellent plan.

1297
02:09:04,527 --> 02:09:05,676
Cavalry!

1298
02:09:17,447 --> 02:09:18,800
Ready!

1299
02:09:37,607 --> 02:09:40,246
Raise arrows!
Raise arrows!

1300
02:09:41,287 --> 02:09:42,276
Ready!

1301
02:09:45,847 --> 02:09:47,678
Raise arrows!

1302
02:09:48,047 --> 02:09:49,844
Release! Release!

1303
02:10:01,887 --> 02:10:02,876
Release!

1304
02:10:38,527 --> 02:10:39,721
For the love of God, Marion!

1305
02:10:43,887 --> 02:10:45,161
Loxley,

1306
02:10:45,487 --> 02:10:48,320
circle your troops and then join the charge.

1307
02:10:53,247 --> 02:10:54,282
With me!

1308
02:10:59,007 --> 02:11:00,235
Release!

1309
02:11:10,807 --> 02:11:11,842
Release!

1310
02:11:57,487 --> 02:11:59,557
Forward!

1311
02:12:16,847 --> 02:12:18,360
Archers, forward!

1312
02:12:44,327 --> 02:12:46,045
Let's go, Marshal.

1313
02:12:46,127 --> 02:12:47,560
We're close enough, Sire.

1314
02:12:48,207 --> 02:12:49,959
This was not
close enough for Richard.

1315
02:12:50,047 --> 02:12:51,799
And look what happened to him.

1316
02:12:52,807 --> 02:12:54,160
Forward!

1317
02:12:54,647 --> 02:12:56,126
Protect the King!

1318
02:13:26,087 --> 02:13:27,805
This is for you, Walter.

1319
02:13:40,367 --> 02:13:43,245
No!

1320
02:13:50,247 --> 02:13:51,441
Marion!

1321
02:15:30,607 --> 02:15:32,006
Marion!

1322
02:15:58,407 --> 02:15:59,556
Surrender!

1323
02:16:21,607 --> 02:16:23,677
Sire! Sire!

1324
02:16:23,807 --> 02:16:25,798
They've surrendered, Sire!

1325
02:16:26,127 --> 02:16:28,197
Yes! To whom?

1326
02:16:32,047 --> 02:16:33,036
To him.

1327
02:16:33,127 --> 02:16:34,924
Longstride!

1328
02:16:36,527 --> 02:16:38,199
Longstride!

1329
02:16:45,927 --> 02:16:48,077
Longstride!

1330
02:16:49,167 --> 02:16:50,919
Longstride!

1331
02:17:27,247 --> 02:17:29,761
I did not make myself king.

1332
02:17:32,087 --> 02:17:33,440
God did.

1333
02:17:34,287 --> 02:17:36,198
King by divine right.

1334
02:17:37,447 --> 02:17:40,564
Now you come to me with this document

1335
02:17:42,047 --> 02:17:45,756
seeking to limit the authority
given to me by God!

1336
02:17:45,847 --> 02:17:48,236
Sire, you gave your word!

1337
02:17:48,327 --> 02:17:49,362
No.

1338
02:17:49,447 --> 02:17:53,156
- Sire, you give us our word, Sire!
- Did I command you to speak, sir?

1339
02:17:53,367 --> 02:17:55,597
- John...
- Or you, madam?

1340
02:17:55,687 --> 02:17:57,678
Sire, we looked to you!

1341
02:17:57,767 --> 02:18:00,839
Look to your estates, instead.

1342
02:18:03,767 --> 02:18:05,086
Archers!

1343
02:18:05,687 --> 02:18:08,679
You are fortunate
that I am in a merciful mood.

1344
02:18:09,807 --> 02:18:14,005
But as for Robin Longstride,
that mason's son,

1345
02:18:15,127 --> 02:18:19,279
for the crimes of theft
and incitement to cause unrest,

1346
02:18:19,367 --> 02:18:23,485
who pretended to be a knight of the realm,
a crime punishable by death,

1347
02:18:23,567 --> 02:18:28,277
I declare him,
from this day forth, to be an outlaw!

1348
02:18:30,127 --> 02:18:33,597
To be hunted all the days of his life...

1349
02:18:33,687 --> 02:18:37,566
- We will not stand for this!
...until his corpse, unburied, is carrion

1350
02:18:37,647 --> 02:18:40,241
for foxes and crows!

1351
02:19:02,367 --> 02:19:04,244
Hear me! Hear me!

1352
02:19:07,127 --> 02:19:08,719
By royal decree,

1353
02:19:09,287 --> 02:19:12,643
Robin Longstride,
also known as Robin of the Hood,

1354
02:19:12,927 --> 02:19:15,919
and all who shelter him or aid him

1355
02:19:16,007 --> 02:19:17,599
are declared outlaws of the realm,

1356
02:19:18,767 --> 02:19:20,325
Their properties forfeit,

1357
02:19:20,407 --> 02:19:24,400
and their lives shall be taken
by any Englishman on sight.

1358
02:19:30,087 --> 02:19:32,681
A nail please? And a hammer.

1359
02:19:33,367 --> 02:19:34,561
A nail!

1360
02:20:23,447 --> 02:20:25,642
Off you go. Come on.

1361
02:20:26,527 --> 02:20:27,642
Hey, boys.

1362
02:20:27,727 --> 02:20:29,604
- You've been practising tying your knots?
- Yes.

1363
02:20:29,687 --> 02:20:31,439
Have you been shooting
your bow and arrows?

1364
02:20:31,527 --> 02:20:33,040
Who hit something? Anyone?

1365
02:20:33,127 --> 02:20:35,800
<i>The greenwood
is the outlaw's friend.</i>

1366
02:20:35,927 --> 02:20:38,521
<i>Now, the orphan boys make us welcome.</i>

1367
02:20:39,407 --> 02:20:40,726
<i>No tax, no tithe.</i>

1368
02:20:40,807 --> 02:20:45,039
<i>Nobody rich, nobody poor.
Fair shares for all at nature's table.</i>

1369
02:20:45,367 --> 02:20:49,326
<i>Many wrongs to be righted
in the country of King John.</i>

1370
02:20:52,527 --> 02:20:54,597
<i>Watch over us, Walter.</i>

1371
02:23:46,767 --> 02:23:48,200
For the Lion Heart!
