1
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,782
Spare some change?

2
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:49,002
Come on!

3
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:52,339
If you wanna make my money you
gotta get rougher than this.

4
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,307
Hey!
Hey you!

5
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,776
You wanna get in on this?

6
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:57,144
Come On.

7
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,879
Ten dollars.

8
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:01,114
<i>Ten dollars.
Come on!</i>

9
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:03,517
<i>Hey,
fuck you then!</i>

10
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,453
You'll never make
money without me.

11
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,655
Alright, alright
let's see some blood.

12
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:14,761
<i>That's it.
That's it.</i>

13
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:33,280
Go damn it,

14
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,949
HELP me,
they're coming after me!

15
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:37,851
Please!

16
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:41,088
Lady, please help me,
get this off me!

17
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:42,889
They're gonna fucking kill me.

18
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:44,758
You've gotta help me here!

19
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,761
<i>Please,
get this off my neck.</i>

20
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:50,564
Get back,
don't leave me!

21
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:52,599
Fuck.

22
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:01,508
You!

23
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,076
<i>Please you've
gotta help me here.</i>

24
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,579
If you don't help me my hand's
coming off my fucking body.

25
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,781
<i>Please just untie me,
that's it.</i>

26
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,299
Oh brother of mine.

27
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:29,369
Look at you now.

28
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,071
Boys. This isn't
a joke anymore.

29
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,572
You weren't planning on
leaving town without

30
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,808
saying goodbye were ya?

31
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:37,344
Yeah, we've been looking
all over for you.

32
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:38,979
I was gettin' worried.

33
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,113
I'm your uncle.

34
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:41,648
I've known you since
you were fuckin' babies!

35
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:44,417
This cocksucker gave me the
shittiest Christmas presents.

36
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,720
I hate Christmas.

37
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:48,955
You fucking brats!
Fuck off!

38
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:50,924
Drake, stop this,
we're family!

39
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,559
It's the rules,
Logan.

40
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:55,896
You're our lucky contestant.

41
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,199
<i>No,
please.</i>

42
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,534
Don't put me in there.

43
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:02,702
Show 'em how to play boys.

44
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:04,404
<i>Slick. You we're always
my favorite nephew</i>

45
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:05,672
I swear to God
I mean that.

46
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:09,042
Get your feet in that
fucking deathhole!

47
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,944
Fuck!

48
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:18,885
Ivan my boy.

49
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:21,955
I want everybody here
to appreciate this.

50
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:26,226
Time to get the show
on the road boy-yo.

51
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:30,063
Alright you fucking androids.

52
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:33,166
My father's got something
he wants you all to see.

53
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,838
<i>And I swear, anybody looks
away for even a second,</i>

54
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:40,307
<i>I'll make them wish they
we're fucking aborted.</i>

55
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,377
Ladies and Gentlemen,
welcome to the Drake Show.

56
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:47,047
Tonight's special episode
is going to be filled with

57
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,785
thrills, and chills, and
my own personal favorite.

58
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:53,687
Lots and lots of
that red shit

59
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,724
that flows inside
all our bodies.

60
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:01,628
IVAN?

61
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:02,863
CHEER you fuckers!

62
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:06,399
Thank you.

63
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,203
<i>How can you watch
and not do anything?</i>

64
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:11,938
They're going to
fucking kill me here!

65
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:14,708
<i>Somebody say something!
Don't just stand there!</i>

66
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:17,110
You know, ever since our
mother brought Logan home

67
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:20,647
from the hospital, I knew
he was a fucking coward.

68
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:23,917
I'll leave town!

69
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,886
You'll never fucking
see me again.

70
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,288
Just please, I can't
feel my legs, Drake.

71
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,856
He wants mercy from the Drake.

72
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,491
From the Drake...

73
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:34,394
And he should know
better than anybody...

74
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:36,062
mercy ain't my style.

75
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:37,631
What do you want from me?

76
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:40,901
Logan is no longer my brother.

77
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:43,570
Our relationship
has been severed.

78
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:48,174
And now he's all
alone in this world,

79
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,777
<i>with nothing but a</i>

80
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:55,248
<i>barbed wire noose
around his neck.</i>

81
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:56,850
You can't let him
do this!

82
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,451
It's not just MY
life he's ruining.

83
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:00,053
<i>Please.
Help me.</i>

84
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,521
<i>Please!</i>

85
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:03,790
<i>You should have started
beggin' a long time ago.</i>

86
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:06,026
<i>I've never enjoyed
listening to you</i>

87
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:08,595
as much as I do right now.

88
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,130
You're a fucking animal Drake!

89
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,632
You're a shitty fucking
weird little animal.

90
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:17,137
The way I see it, I'm a
fucking miracle worker,

91
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,407
because I am going
to make it rain!

92
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,042
Gun it,
Slick!

93
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,099
Well, can you feel
your legs now?

94
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,200
Can ya?
Huh!

95
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,436
Was there something else
you wanted to say to me?

96
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:54,708
Well, thanks for tuning
in ladies and gentlemen.

97
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:56,476
<i>Who knows,
maybe next time</i>

98
00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:01,214
one of you will be
our lucky contestant.

99
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:03,683
Enjoy the ride,
my favorite fuckin' uncle.

100
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:08,388
<i>Go the fuck home everybody!</i>

101
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:11,057
And don't forget
to wash your dicks!

102
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:07,480
$49.99.

103
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:49,622
Ugh.

104
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:01,394
<i>I dare you to lick his dick.</i>

105
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:08,401
<i>Woo! Woo!</i>

106
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:17,076
You bastards!

107
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:28,815
Hey Slick, you gotta
check this out man.

108
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,216
Fuckin awesome.

109
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:38,491
Hey, where the
fuck are you going?

110
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:41,127
Business with dad.

111
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,916
<i>Ah.</i>

112
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,519
Hey Otis.
What are ya playing?

113
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:07,687
I forgot Slick.

114
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,389
I spent all my
money in the arcade.

115
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:11,324
You owe me money.

116
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,526
You're burning me,
Otis.

117
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,728
Let me call my mom! I can
get my allowance early!

118
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:19,565
That must be some
hell of an allowance.

119
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:22,869
Come on man,
he's a kid,

120
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:24,904
let it slide.

121
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:32,845
What did you say to me?

122
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,714
You heard me.
Let it slide.

123
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,816
Sh-sh-sh...

124
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:39,819
The only thing
I'm gonna let slide,

125
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:43,323
is my dick in your pussy.

126
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:50,797
Hey, Otie -
where ya going?

127
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,165
Don't hurt me IVAN!

128
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:53,733
Shut the fuck up!

129
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,473
Did that hurt?

130
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,741
No.

131
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:04,310
You want to know how to
never feel pain again?

132
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,745
No I
don't want any more!

133
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:08,047
Does everybody wanna know

134
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:10,116
how to never
feel pain again?

135
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,253
Come on Otis!

136
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:17,457
Have at it!

137
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:49,222
You know how I can tell
I'm making you wet?

138
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:50,556
No.

139
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,960
Cause you're making
my dick thirsty.

140
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,902
What are you supposed to be?

141
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:05,271
<i>Some kind of bad ass
murderer or something?</i>

142
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:06,606
Why?

143
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,374
Does that frighten you?

144
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:12,111
If you've got money to
spend, nothing frightens me.

145
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:13,713
Baby, I've got all
kinds of money with

146
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,716
your name written
all over it.

147
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,452
Well what are
you waiting for?

148
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:21,320
Let's go.

149
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:23,256
Awesome.

150
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,442
Nobody messes
with you, do they?

151
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:45,578
Not if they give a
fuck about living.

152
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,548
So how many people
have you killed?

153
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:51,851
What am I?
A mathematician?

154
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,186
You're sexy...

155
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:54,554
<i>You're fucking right.</i>

156
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:56,489
Are we gonna fuck,
or what?

157
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:11,204
What the hell?

158
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:13,005
That's your ride bitch.
Come on.

159
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,941
This was not
our fucking deal!

160
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,843
I'm paying you good money.
You're gonna love this!

161
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:20,480
Let the girl go Punk.

162
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:24,750
I'm making a citizen's arrest.

163
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:29,989
And who the fuck are you?

164
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:32,525
<i>Put the knife away kid</i>

165
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,861
or I'll use it to
cut welfare cheques

166
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:37,063
from your rotten skin.

167
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,332
Well you better cut
one to Mother Theresa

168
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:40,867
so you can give it
to her while she's

169
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,269
finger banging you in hell.

170
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:46,906
Shut you filthy mouth!

171
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,375
<i>Mother Theresa is
a God damn saint!</i>

172
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,482
Serves you right.

173
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,684
What did you think?

174
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:01,120
He was gonna put a
ring on your finger?

175
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,115
Lock him up with
the Sodomites.

176
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:33,886
And get me the god-damned
chief of police now.

177
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,935
Good day sir.

178
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:51,470
No, no please,
take a seat.

179
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,908
I don't think I've seen
you around here before.

180
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:58,511
<i>Let me guess, you
rode in on the rail?</i>

181
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:00,446
That's right.

182
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:04,016
So I understand you've been
having a little bit

183
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:07,253
of difficulty with one
of our young men.

184
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:11,857
Well, I think you're gonna
need a lot of dump trucks.

185
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:13,893
Dump trucks?

186
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,328
I don't follow you.

187
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:17,029
You get out there,
get all the criminals,

188
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:18,164
put 'em in dump trucks.

189
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:21,767
Take em to a landfill
site and bury them.

190
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:24,036
Put 'em in the ground.

191
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,471
I'm not too sure

192
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:28,074
I know what you're trying
to say here, sir.

193
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,376
What I'm trying
to say is that

194
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:35,548
people don't go bad
like they do here.

195
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:38,117
Look,
if I'm being honest,

196
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,153
I can't argue with
anything you say.

197
00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:43,956
<i>Crime in this city has
become an embarrassment.</i>

198
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,826
I've been suspecting
some of my boys

199
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,861
are working with Drake.

200
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:56,602
<i>C of my officers are givingis
that maniac a free reign?me</i>

201
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,905
So thank god for honest
people like yourself.

202
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:02,808
You better get those officers
and send them packing.

203
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:07,213
And start this whole
operation all over again.

204
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,448
Between you and me, I'd love
to bring a wrecking ball

205
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,283
down on Drake.

206
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:14,120
<i>But he might as
well be KING around here!</i>

207
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,655
King's fall.

208
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:18,190
You ought to read a
history book, Chief.

209
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:19,458
<i>Now I gave you this
little bastard,</i>

210
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,127
put him away for life.

211
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,797
<i>Well, we'll certainly see
what we can do about that.</i>

212
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:28,534
<i>By the way,
did...</i>

213
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:31,337
anybody officially
welcome you to town yet?

214
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,738
They never do.

215
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,040
Well...

216
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:36,876
welcome to Fuck-town.

217
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,247
<i>Hold still,
you slimy maggot!</i>

218
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:46,419
Get off me!

219
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:49,488
<i>These two are the
princes of Fuck town!</i>

220
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,257
<i>Any idea what we should
do with him, Slick?</i>

221
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:54,026
Yeah,
hold him still.

222
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:57,063
Ah!

223
00:19:57,096 --> 00:19:59,398
I'm gonna carve a
billboard into his chest.

224
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:01,400
You better get that
knife away from me!

225
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,505
<i>Easy Slick, I think you
might be hurting him.</i>

226
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:07,740
<i>God,
Jesus God boys.</i>

227
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:11,043
<i>What ever happened to
delicacy and finesse?</i>

228
00:20:11,077 --> 00:20:13,813
This is so you'll
never forget what you are.

229
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,985
I thought this was
a police station.

230
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:22,788
Not a fucking circus.

231
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:27,093
I just wanted to help.

232
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,332
Ah!

233
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:39,071
And don't forget you
fucking piece of shit,

234
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:42,975
everyday is garbage day
for street trash like you.

235
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,463
<i>Hey.</i>

236
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:05,931
<i>You're so hot,</i>

237
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:07,500
<i>you make me want
to cut my dick off and</i>

238
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:10,136
rub it all over
your titties.

239
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:12,171
Why don't you just calm down

240
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:13,773
and tell me what
you're looking for.

241
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:15,808
I was hoping to
keep it a surprise.

242
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:18,577
I've had enough
surprises tonight.

243
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,613
Quit wasting my time.

244
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:21,680
What's it gonna be?

245
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:24,216
<i>Come on Abby,
I'm a regular.</i>

246
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,886
<i>Baby, nothing about
you is regular.</i>

247
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:29,121
Hey, look, I'm the
one with the money

248
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:33,325
and you're the one
selling your hole...

249
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:36,228
I know that sweetie,

250
00:21:36,262 --> 00:21:38,330
I'd love to take your money.

251
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:40,699
<i>So why don't you just
tell me what you're after?</i>

252
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:42,001
Fuck it.

253
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:44,904
Just give me the
regular, plus 10%.

254
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:46,238
Okay.

255
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:48,707
<i>I'm gonna make you love
the taste of my rot!</i>

256
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:51,377
<i>What the fuck?</i>

257
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,612
<i>Get the fuck off me!</i>

258
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,560
Oh my God.

259
00:22:07,593 --> 00:22:09,461
Help me.

260
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:35,054
I could use a drink right now.

261
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,658
Do you mind?

262
00:22:41,594 --> 00:22:44,163
I really appreciate
your helping me out today.

263
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,699
<i>If it wasn't for
you, who knows,</i>

264
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:49,168
<i>I'd probably be dead
in ditch somewhere.</i>

265
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:53,839
<i>I see you have an empty
picture frame here.</i>

266
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:58,544
<i>Why don't you put
a picture of your</i>

267
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:02,047
famit.

268
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:05,818
I don't really have
anything worth remembering.

269
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,390
Right.

270
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:25,537
<i>You seem like a smart
intelligent girl.</i>

271
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:29,275
You should be teaching.

272
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:33,779
Tell people about beautiful
things and miracles.

273
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:36,382
You're obviously
not from here.

274
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,851
I'm not from anywhere.

275
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:41,987
<i>Yeah, well
I fuck for a living</i>

276
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:46,659
and believe me I don't
have a lot of other options.

277
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:48,560
Right.

278
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:50,229
Well, I wouldn't
know about that shit.

279
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,697
Hey,
take it easy.

280
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:54,466
<i>I think I'm okay now.</i>

281
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:59,238
I just tell my brain

282
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,774
when I know I'm hurting.

283
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:05,244
<i>I just say I got
nothing for you buddy...</i>

284
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:10,082
Nothing to make it go
away, so just go to hell.

285
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,985
<i>And he goes.</i>

286
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:15,754
He's like a
brother to me now

287
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:20,526
and brothers fight sometimes.

288
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:28,067
Well, I think it's time to put
you and your brother to bed.

289
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:36,275
No, I'm not going
to stay here.

290
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,609
I'm gonna go,
it's all right.

291
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,078
No, no,
it's okay.

292
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:41,146
I want you to.

293
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,682
It's a good one.

294
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:53,859
I don't even remember
when I slept a real bed.

295
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:56,395
I am tired.

296
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:58,564
I didn't get your name.

297
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:01,900
It's Abby.

298
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:03,635
Here.

299
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:06,071
Put this on so you don't
get blood on my sheets.

300
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:08,407
Oh.
Thank you.

301
00:25:13,312 --> 00:25:17,483
Oh,
I like that.

302
00:25:18,784 --> 00:25:21,687
This is good.

303
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,322
Thank you.

304
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:27,092
<i>Well Abby,
can I...</i>

305
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:30,863
tell you something
about bears?

306
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:33,265
Sure.

307
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:40,672
<i>The bear is a solitary animal.</i>

308
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:43,876
<i>They like their space.</i>

309
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:47,780
They live in a magic circle.

310
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:50,716
They mind if you're
like a mile away,

311
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:53,919
but if you get
inside their circle,

312
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:56,722
<i>they will maul you.</i>

313
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:59,992
If a bear's claw would
ever strike your face,

314
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:04,229
it would take your whole
face right off your skull.

315
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:06,365
<i>Your eyes, your
nose, your lips.</i>

316
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,333
Everything.

317
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:10,769
And you would die from it.

318
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:12,738
Wow.

319
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:14,840
I didn't know bears
could be so vicious.

320
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:18,444
They are
wild animals.

321
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:26,185
There's something else about
bears not many people know.

322
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:30,389
<i>If a bear gets hooked on
the taste of human blood,</i>

323
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:34,860
he becomes a man killer.

324
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:37,830
He'll go on a rampage

325
00:26:37,863 --> 00:26:40,432
and has to be destroyed

326
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:50,976
and that's why you
should never hug a bear.

327
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,547
Give me that fucking money!

328
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,948
You fucking little bitch,

329
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:30,983
I'll shove that
money up your...

330
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:33,919
Move bitch!

331
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,958
Make you feel it.

332
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,928
Help!

333
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:46,431
Don't let him take me!

334
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:48,100
Help me someone!

335
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:03,916
<i>Beautiful.
Beautiful.</i>

336
00:28:03,949 --> 00:28:05,417
<i>I love your work.</i>

337
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:11,490
Hey!

338
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:16,828
Back for that 10
dollars, eh dirt bag?

339
00:28:19,932 --> 00:28:23,502
You're right.

340
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,670
Ah!

341
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:28,173
Yeah!

342
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:30,042
Beautiful.

343
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:33,946
I'm only giving you
twenty for that one buddy.

344
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:38,450
<i>Now get down
on your knees,</i>

345
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:41,820
go on,
on you go.

346
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:49,595
<i>Now I want you to start
chewin' the glass.</i>

347
00:28:49,628 --> 00:28:51,430
What?

348
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:55,100
<i>I want you to start
eating that glass.</i>

349
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:56,902
<i>Go on.</i>

350
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:58,570
<i>Don't even bother
looking at this,</i>

351
00:28:58,604 --> 00:29:00,939
until you start chewing.

352
00:29:00,973 --> 00:29:03,075
<i>Go on.</i>

353
00:29:05,644 --> 00:29:07,179
That's it.

354
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:09,081
That's it.

355
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:19,224
<i>Oh, now smile
for the camera.</i>

356
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:24,529
<i>Holy shit,
this is fucking gold!</i>

357
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:29,368
Now...

358
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:32,504
<i>pick it up with you mouth.</i>

359
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:35,974
<i>That's it.</i>

360
00:29:36,008 --> 00:29:38,810
<i>Arrr...</i>

361
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,447
Good dog.

362
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:44,483
You earned your money today.

363
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:46,652
Yeah.

364
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:48,880
<i>Yeah,
you heard me right,</i>

365
00:30:48,914 --> 00:30:52,084
<i>I want four
big fucking dogs...</i>

366
00:30:52,117 --> 00:30:53,952
Un-huh, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

367
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:56,722
And shave em first.

368
00:30:56,755 --> 00:30:58,457
<i>Lady.</i>

369
00:30:58,490 --> 00:30:59,825
<i>I don't trade for babies.</i>

370
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,194
<i>If you're looking for jewelry
you gotta cough it up.</i>

371
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:35,861
All right everyone this is
a god damn fucking robbery!

372
00:31:38,163 --> 00:31:42,601
Ah!

373
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:46,705
<i>Okay, this guy,
this guy,</i>

374
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,608
he is a great baby sitter!

375
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:50,742
<i>Don't worry about Junior.</i>

376
00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:53,412
I'll look after him.

377
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:56,782
Give me the fucking money or
I'll slit her god damn throat!

378
00:31:56,815 --> 00:31:58,116
Okay,
okay.

379
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,151
<i>What are you waiting for?!</i>

380
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:02,154
Fucking kill her!
Kill the fucking baby!

381
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:03,722
<i>Here it is,
here it comes.</i>

382
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,490
<i>All right.</i>

383
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:11,696
<i>Old man you've got five
seconds to give me what I want</i>

384
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,632
or I will end her life.

385
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:15,901
Put you hands in
the cash register,

386
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,170
<i>give me more you
piece of shit!</i>

387
00:32:18,203 --> 00:32:19,438
That's it,
that's everything.

388
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:21,173
- 1...
- No.

389
00:32:21,206 --> 00:32:22,340
2...

390
00:32:22,374 --> 00:32:23,875
Faster,
come on!

391
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:25,177
3!

392
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:26,878
No!

393
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:44,963
<i>Come on!</i>

394
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:46,364
4!

395
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:48,867
Just fucking kill her already!

396
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,770
<i>I'm gonna sleep in
your bloody carcasses.</i>

397
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:52,737
Tonight!

398
00:32:58,677 --> 00:32:59,878
Ah!

399
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:01,146
Jesus Christ!

400
00:33:10,522 --> 00:33:13,158
<i>You vultures</i>

401
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:16,595
<i>circle this city tearing
off the flesh</i>

402
00:33:16,628 --> 00:33:19,464
from everything
that is innocent.

403
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:23,902
Please don't shoot me.

404
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,904
I didn't even hurt her.

405
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:28,139
I want you out of this city,

406
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:30,575
you and your
grave-robbing friends.

407
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:33,245
Spread the word.

408
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,315
Now!

409
00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:46,024
Pay guns!

410
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:47,259
Keep the change.

411
00:33:51,897 --> 00:33:54,499
Oh fuck!

412
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:11,783
<i>Where's the tape?</i>

413
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:13,552
Leave me alone man.

414
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:16,121
Take it out.

415
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:20,759
<i>Now you put it in
your mouth and eat it.</i>

416
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:34,439
You fucking bitch.

417
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:36,274
Stop wasting your
time doing homework.

418
00:34:36,308 --> 00:34:39,244
Get up on the block
and make me some money.

419
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:41,680
Come on baby,

420
00:34:41,713 --> 00:34:45,617
show daddy you ain't mad
at me and give me a kiss.

421
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,352
<i>Listen.</i>

422
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:49,554
<i>Go home to someone
who loves you.</i>

423
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:50,555
<i>Now.</i>

424
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:56,528
And you -
you're fucked.

425
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:11,676
<i>Fuck em.</i>

426
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,278
<i>Read em and fucking weep!</i>

427
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:14,946
You can have
the fucking bitches.

428
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,518
Happy Valentines Day,
you fucking sluts!

429
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:31,896
Kill him!
Fucking kill him!

430
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:33,264
Kill him!

431
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,454
Hallelujah.

432
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,673
<i>I'm gonna come down
both your chimneys</i>

433
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:18,076
and give you a big present.

434
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:24,249
<i>Jerk on this you child
molesting shit-licker.</i>

435
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:25,850
Ah!

436
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:39,631
<i>Night watches and other
anti-crime groups have been</i>

437
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:41,966
seen springing up all
throughout the city and their

438
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,537
inspiration, a brave,
yet still unidentified,

439
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:48,373
homeless man who has
been delivering justice,

440
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:50,842
one shell at a time.

441
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,346
A shotgun!

442
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,549
This town is impressed by

443
00:36:57,582 --> 00:37:00,585
a homeless man with
a fucking shotgun.

444
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:02,120
Ow!

445
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:03,922
Where's the
creativity in that?

446
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:09,527
So what happened to you?

447
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:11,463
School bully get
your lunch money?

448
00:37:11,496 --> 00:37:12,864
I don't want
to talk about it.

449
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,200
<i>Look Slick,
don't make me mad.</i>

450
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,801
Tell me who did this to you.

451
00:37:16,835 --> 00:37:19,537
I don't know.
Some bum?

452
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,339
Some bum!

453
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:24,576
Have you been watching
the fucking news lately?

454
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:27,779
Don't worry dad,
we carved that fucker up.

455
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:29,547
You carved him up.

456
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,649
Somebody does this
to your brother

457
00:37:31,683 --> 00:37:33,218
and you treat him like
a Jack-o'- lantern.

458
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,720
Put your head on the table.

459
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:38,356
<i>Head down,
now!</i>

460
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:39,924
Don't worry son,
everybody gets knocked out

461
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:41,359
once in a while.

462
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:42,894
Really?

463
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,663
Have you ever
been knocked out?

464
00:37:45,697 --> 00:37:47,532
Fuck no,
I'm the DRAKE,

465
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:49,300
who's going to fuck with me?

466
00:37:49,334 --> 00:37:51,136
But I'm Slick,
nobody's supposed

467
00:37:51,169 --> 00:37:52,537
to fuck with me either.

468
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:55,874
<i>Listen, you've got
a lot of potential,</i>

469
00:37:55,907 --> 00:37:57,876
way more than your brother...

470
00:37:57,909 --> 00:37:59,177
head down.

471
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:02,480
<i>Maybe even more potential
than me, eventually,</i>

472
00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:06,317
but first you've got to
learn to think bigger.

473
00:38:06,351 --> 00:38:07,986
Bigger?

474
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:11,055
I'll crucify him to
a homeless shelter.

475
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:13,057
That's revenge.
Don't look for revenge.

476
00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:15,160
Look for people's fear.

477
00:38:15,193 --> 00:38:16,961
Okay,
fear.

478
00:38:16,995 --> 00:38:18,396
I'll cut a hole
through his body,

479
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:20,165
and I'll make them watch as
I spread his intestines

480
00:38:20,198 --> 00:38:21,533
out all over the street.

481
00:38:21,566 --> 00:38:25,770
Well, you be ugly, you be
hateful when you do that,

482
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,906
some will fear you...

483
00:38:27,939 --> 00:38:29,307
<i>Slick...</i>

484
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,842
<i>I want to fear you...</i>

485
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:32,243
But I don't...

486
00:38:32,277 --> 00:38:34,712
You've got to show me that
you can scare the shit

487
00:38:34,746 --> 00:38:36,381
out of everybody!

488
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:39,651
So why don't you unlock that
imagination of yours and give

489
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:42,921
<i>them a show that is so fierce</i>

490
00:38:42,954 --> 00:38:44,889
that everybody in this town

491
00:38:44,923 --> 00:38:48,660
will remember
your name forever.

492
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:51,196
What should I do?

493
00:38:51,229 --> 00:38:56,234
Well, you need to figure
that out for yourself,

494
00:38:56,267 --> 00:39:01,606
but I can give you one
sweet morsel of advice.

495
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:05,376
When life gives
you razor blades,

496
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:11,316
<i>you make a baseball bat
covered in razor blades.</i>

497
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:56,461
Do you kids like school?

498
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:59,697
Hey,
I asked you a question.

499
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:02,533
Do you kids like school!

500
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:03,768
Yeah!

501
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:06,404
<i>What about ice cream!
Do you kids like ice cream?</i>

502
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:07,839
Yeah!

503
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:09,707
And bicycles!

504
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:11,042
Yeah!

505
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,777
And Hobos?

506
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,279
Yeah!

507
00:40:14,312 --> 00:40:18,182
I hate Hobos.

508
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:31,963
Disco Inferno.

509
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:36,234
<i>After a horrific act of
arson this afternoon,</i>

510
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,803
<i>a school bus was
found burning.</i>

511
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:41,839
<i>There were an undisclosed
number of children on board.</i>

512
00:40:41,873 --> 00:40:43,708
<i>There were no survivors.</i>

513
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:47,745
<i>Again, we regret to inform you
that only the charred bodies</i>

514
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:51,349
<i>of many, many, burnt
children remain...</i>

515
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:58,456
<i>Hi all you kids out there.</i>

516
00:40:58,489 --> 00:40:59,958
How are you doing today?
Good?

517
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:01,826
Great.
Guess what.

518
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:03,761
I've got something very,

519
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:06,364
<i>very special to
share with you today.</i>

520
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:07,865
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, yeah. Come on up to

521
00:41:07,899 --> 00:41:09,600
the screen kids. Let go of your
mommy and daddy's hands.

522
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:10,735
Come, come on,
it's okay.

523
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:13,838
Get as close to
the TV as you can.

524
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:16,140
Do you see this!

525
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:18,509
<i>This is what you get when
you want to follow a beggars</i>

526
00:41:18,543 --> 00:41:20,011
instead of the DRAKE!

527
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:23,014
<i>Now It's time to
play a new game.</i>

528
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:24,716
It's called gutter tag.

529
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:27,185
<i>It's very,
very easy.</i>

530
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:30,121
And every single one
of you gets to play.

531
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:33,057
<i>All you homeless people -
you're it.</i>

532
00:41:33,091 --> 00:41:35,760
<i>Everyone else -
you get to kill them.</i>

533
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:37,962
All of them.
Otherwise...

534
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:39,998
We're going to kill the
rest of your children!

535
00:41:40,031 --> 00:41:42,667
Ladies and gentlemen,
one more thing before you

536
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,536
continue on your busy day...

537
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:49,407
I want that Hobo's
head on my wall,

538
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,975
<i>and whoever brings
him to me,</i>

539
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:54,946
gets all my broads!

540
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,483
<i>Oh, you're gonna
like em!</i>

541
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,168
Grab your guns boys!

542
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,803
Grab your fucking guns.

543
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:20,004
We got homeless to kill.

544
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:21,906
So let's go make
some dead bodies.

545
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:24,342
At least he's only
shooting the dirty cops.

546
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,844
We're all dirty cops.

547
00:43:56,968 --> 00:44:01,339
<i>You ever sleep with
a prostitute, kid?</i>

548
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:03,207
No sir.

549
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:06,978
Fuck.
She's so hot,

550
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:09,413
<i>I'd eat the
peanuts out of her shit.</i>

551
00:44:12,884 --> 00:44:14,952
Come on. What the fuck
is wrong with you?

552
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:16,787
This conversation
is disgusting.

553
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:20,124
Well, you can't
beat your wife

554
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:22,693
like you can beat a whore.

555
00:44:22,727 --> 00:44:26,664
That's what
I love about them.

556
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:29,600
Tell you what, we'll
go splits on this one.

557
00:44:29,634 --> 00:44:33,104
You're joking right?

558
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:48,252
Hey, hey,
Abby.

559
00:44:48,286 --> 00:44:52,957
Fuck, I love the
smell of your asshole.

560
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:56,661
<i>Why don't you get in here
and take me for a ride.</i>

561
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:59,263
My legs are closed
for the night.

562
00:44:59,297 --> 00:45:00,932
Maybe we should
get back to work.

563
00:45:00,965 --> 00:45:03,634
You get back to the
fucking station.

564
00:45:03,668 --> 00:45:06,571
<i>Get the fuck out of here!</i>

565
00:45:08,773 --> 00:45:11,842
Come here,
baby!

566
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:27,258
No!

567
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:28,593
Babydoll.

568
00:45:28,626 --> 00:45:31,562
I am going to break your legs
off to get at your sweetness.

569
00:45:34,432 --> 00:45:36,400
Don't hurt me.
I'll do anything!

570
00:45:36,434 --> 00:45:39,470
That's not even
a fucking option.

571
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:40,738
Now,
I'll tell you what:

572
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:44,208
<i>You make sure that
I enjoy what you give me</i>

573
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:49,046
<i>and I'll make sure that
you can still crawl home</i>

574
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,114
when I'm done.

575
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:54,418
Oh come on, now I
know you want it,

576
00:45:54,452 --> 00:45:55,987
No!

577
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:58,889
You little fucking whore.

578
00:46:03,561 --> 00:46:06,030
Step away from the girl.

579
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:07,431
<i>I'm a cop!</i>

580
00:46:07,465 --> 00:46:08,633
Don't do anything
fucking stupid!

581
00:46:08,666 --> 00:46:10,568
Shut up!

582
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,536
Look at her.

583
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:15,273
What do you see?

584
00:46:15,306 --> 00:46:17,441
<i>I don't know man.</i>

585
00:46:17,475 --> 00:46:19,844
She's... she's
just a fuck tube.

586
00:46:21,946 --> 00:46:25,149
She is a teacher!

587
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:31,689
She despises you,

588
00:46:34,025 --> 00:46:35,660
and so do I!

589
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:38,663
STOP!
STOP!

590
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:42,500
STOP!

591
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:44,602
What are you doing?

592
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:48,205
Let me walk you home!

593
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:50,574
Why are you out so late -
it's dangerous!

594
00:46:50,608 --> 00:46:53,377
Why are you doing this?

595
00:46:53,411 --> 00:46:55,212
Shit.

596
00:47:00,251 --> 00:47:03,254
What are you doing?
You can't kill them.

597
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:05,156
I'm cleaning the streets

598
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:08,959
from the shit and
the smell makes me sick.

599
00:47:08,993 --> 00:47:11,529
They're not bad people.
They're just scared.

600
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:13,631
You're not afraid of

601
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:16,200
what they'll do to us
when they come here?

602
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:18,903
We have to figure
something out.

603
00:47:35,653 --> 00:47:38,723
He shot him!
The Hobo shot him!

604
00:47:38,756 --> 00:47:43,361
He's back there!

605
00:48:04,582 --> 00:48:07,184
Mom, I need my allowance
early this week...

606
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:10,821
I just do!

607
00:48:10,855 --> 00:48:11,889
Okay,
come on.

608
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:14,291
Come on.

609
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:25,302
You're pretty sick,
you know that?

610
00:48:25,336 --> 00:48:28,372
Come on,
we gotta go.

611
00:48:37,548 --> 00:48:39,717
I gotta go Mom.

612
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,523
Where the hell were you
going after you left here?

613
00:48:45,556 --> 00:48:47,858
What?

614
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:52,096
Come on, man, I let
you sleep in my bed,

615
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:56,333
tell me where you went.

616
00:48:56,367 --> 00:48:59,570
I just wanted to
buy a lawn mower.

617
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:04,375
Wait - you wanted
to buy a lawn mower?

618
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:05,976
Yep.

619
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:07,812
After all those years living
in box cars and on the

620
00:49:07,845 --> 00:49:12,516
streets, I thought I might
start up my own business.

621
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:15,419
That's what we'll do.

622
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:17,221
I've got my own slogan.

623
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:19,557
You grow it,
I cut it.

624
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:21,525
You grow it,
we cut it.

625
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:23,227
We'll get out of this
town and go somewhere

626
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,396
where they have
nice big lawns to mow.

627
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:27,565
This isn't the only
place that grass grows.

628
00:49:27,598 --> 00:49:28,732
Are you serious?

629
00:49:28,766 --> 00:49:30,801
Yeah.

630
00:49:30,835 --> 00:49:34,271
First I gotta wash this
guys asshole off my face.

631
00:49:42,947 --> 00:49:45,683
Slick!
Slick!

632
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:47,184
Slick!
They're in there!

633
00:49:47,218 --> 00:49:48,519
<i>Do you need any back-up?
I could join your gang.</i>

634
00:49:48,552 --> 00:49:50,554
Shut up Otis.
Now fucking beat it!

635
00:49:50,588 --> 00:49:52,256
<i>You're pissing me off.</i>

636
00:49:58,395 --> 00:50:00,231
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

637
00:50:00,264 --> 00:50:01,966
Ivan, you're going to
ruin your fucking skates.

638
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,667
I ruin everything!

639
00:50:05,269 --> 00:50:07,171
Let's fuck.

640
00:50:12,943 --> 00:50:15,179
Macaroni, beans,
I don't know.

641
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:16,981
What would you take?

642
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,149
Why are you in such a rush?

643
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:21,252
You shot a fucking cop.

644
00:50:21,285 --> 00:50:23,754
Everybody wants to kill you.

645
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:25,990
Oh,
all right.

646
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:29,460
We need a blanket, it's gonna
get cold at night and uh,

647
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:31,095
some matches.

648
00:50:31,128 --> 00:50:32,997
I don't have much money.

649
00:50:35,266 --> 00:50:37,134
All right.

650
00:50:39,937 --> 00:50:42,273
Don't worry about the money.
We'll hop on a train.

651
00:50:42,306 --> 00:50:45,976
<i>We'll get a job somewhere
and start saving up.</i>

652
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:48,779
<i>No, no,
no, no TV.</i>

653
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:50,247
We've gotta travel light.

654
00:50:50,281 --> 00:50:52,149
<i>Right.
Fuck TV.</i>

655
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:58,656
Just take what you need.

656
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:05,329
Okay,
I think I'm ready.

657
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,967
Okay,
I'm ready too.

658
00:51:18,709 --> 00:51:20,277
Woo!

659
00:51:20,311 --> 00:51:23,781
It's a beautiful day
for a skate rape!

660
00:51:23,814 --> 00:51:25,549
Is there another way out?

661
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:31,455
Woo!

662
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:34,592
Oh!

663
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:38,529
Do you fucking see me?

664
00:51:38,562 --> 00:51:41,832
<i>Do you fucking hear me?</i>

665
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:47,638
<i>Do you fucking feel me?</i>

666
00:51:51,709 --> 00:51:53,344
<i>Why don't you get up beggar</i>

667
00:51:53,377 --> 00:51:55,579
and beg me for
your fucking life.

668
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:57,281
Ah!

669
00:51:57,314 --> 00:52:01,251
Do you fucking fear me?

670
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:04,288
Fuck you!

671
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:08,025
My face!

672
00:52:11,895 --> 00:52:13,764
Don't kill that
fuck without me.

673
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:16,266
Turn that whore
into a baby factory.

674
00:52:17,935 --> 00:52:19,069
Ah!

675
00:52:27,845 --> 00:52:29,213
Hit me again mother fucker!

676
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:32,082
Come on.
Right in my fucking face!

677
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:37,855
I'm going to wash this
blood off with your blood!

678
00:52:37,888 --> 00:52:39,923
Get away from me!

679
00:52:39,957 --> 00:52:41,792
No!

680
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:46,897
<i>Don't kill me,
don't...</i>

681
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:48,432
I love murder.

682
00:52:50,134 --> 00:52:51,402
Come on,
play with me grandpa.

683
00:52:51,435 --> 00:52:54,071
Fucking play with me Grandpa.

684
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:00,811
Yeah!

685
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,246
Now we're gettin' rowdy!

686
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,600
Abigail...

687
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,441
Sh-sh-sh...

688
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:37,748
You!

689
00:53:37,781 --> 00:53:42,252
Do you know me?

690
00:53:47,858 --> 00:53:49,760
He made me come!

691
00:53:49,793 --> 00:53:51,228
Oh God!

692
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:54,264
Slick, what the fuck
is going on in there?

693
00:53:54,298 --> 00:53:57,468
You better be killing
that fucking hobo!

694
00:53:58,936 --> 00:54:00,504
Get the fuck out
of here IVAN.

695
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:01,772
Now!

696
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:03,440
Bro?

697
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:08,779
All right you
scum carving fuck.

698
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:12,249
I'm going to make you regret
a whole lot of living

699
00:54:12,282 --> 00:54:14,251
and teach you some respect.

700
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:15,552
<i>All right, man,
you win, you win.</i>

701
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:17,988
Just tell me what you want?
My dad owns this fucking town.

702
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:20,624
I bet there's not on human
being in this town

703
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:22,559
who's life you
haven't ruined.

704
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:24,695
Pl.. Please don't shoot
my dick off, okay?

705
00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:26,663
I'm young, I've got too
much fucking left to do.

706
00:54:26,697 --> 00:54:27,731
Please!

707
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:29,099
God damn it boy!

708
00:54:29,133 --> 00:54:32,102
Nooooooo!

709
00:54:35,539 --> 00:54:38,375
I'm gonna get
you to a doctor!

710
00:54:45,716 --> 00:54:47,684
<i>Just give me the
fucking phone.</i>

711
00:54:47,718 --> 00:54:48,652
What?

712
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:50,554
<i>Dad...</i>

713
00:54:50,587 --> 00:54:52,756
My whole body hurts

714
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:53,957
everywhere.

715
00:54:53,991 --> 00:54:55,726
Slick?
Where are you?

716
00:54:55,759 --> 00:54:56,727
What happened?

717
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:00,164
<i>He shot my dick off!</i>

718
00:55:00,197 --> 00:55:02,366
Tell me where you are.
I'll come and get you.

719
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:05,002
<i>I'm not gonna make it dad.</i>

720
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:07,271
I'm dying.
I'm dying.

721
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:11,875
Slick boy, you're tough
and I'm so proud of you.

722
00:55:11,909 --> 00:55:14,011
You're the toughest
kid I know.

723
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:16,780
Thank you.

724
00:55:22,352 --> 00:55:25,355
Hey dad...

725
00:55:27,891 --> 00:55:31,695
<i>You were a pretty rad father.</i>

726
00:55:31,728 --> 00:55:34,097
<i>Slick...</i>

727
00:55:34,131 --> 00:55:36,200
Slick...

728
00:55:36,233 --> 00:55:38,535
<i>Slick!</i>

729
00:55:53,217 --> 00:55:56,453
Fix this girl.

730
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:01,191
Now!

731
00:56:06,296 --> 00:56:08,532
Stop,
you can't do that!

732
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:10,567
Just fix her!

733
00:56:10,601 --> 00:56:12,402
Shit!

734
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:25,048
Summon the plague.

735
00:56:25,082 --> 00:56:29,386
Tell them to bring
me that hobo.

736
00:56:55,279 --> 00:56:56,613
Stay with us honey.

737
00:56:56,647 --> 00:56:57,881
Come on,
stay with us.

738
00:56:57,915 --> 00:56:59,783
<i>It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be alright.</i>

739
00:57:11,662 --> 00:57:14,164
She's fucking dying!

740
00:57:14,197 --> 00:57:16,300
Come on!
Stay with me!

741
00:57:16,333 --> 00:57:17,968
Live!

742
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:20,404
Live you fuckin' whore!

743
00:57:36,353 --> 00:57:37,754
That's it.
Come on.

744
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:39,790
Stay with me.
Stay with me.

745
00:58:19,963 --> 00:58:22,466
Hey you.

746
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:25,635
Welcome back.

747
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:27,804
It's good to see you.

748
00:58:29,973 --> 00:58:32,642
I wanted to give
you something.

749
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:41,985
They're beautiful.

750
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:45,555
Just to make sure
you don't forget me.

751
00:58:47,657 --> 00:58:51,028
Where are you going?

752
00:58:51,061 --> 00:58:55,132
I have to get back to work.

753
00:58:55,165 --> 00:58:58,435
Please don't.

754
00:58:58,468 --> 00:59:02,406
You should put them
in your classroom.

755
00:59:02,439 --> 00:59:06,943
They'll be good by the window.

756
00:59:10,447 --> 00:59:15,218
You know I'm not really
a school teacher, right?

757
00:59:16,987 --> 00:59:20,557
<i>You do right?</i>

758
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:29,099
Yeah, but everybody
ought to have a dream.

759
00:59:35,672 --> 00:59:37,607
You can't solve all the
world's problems

760
00:59:37,641 --> 00:59:42,312
with a shotgun.

761
00:59:42,345 --> 00:59:44,581
It's all I know.

762
01:00:52,782 --> 01:00:57,754
A long time ago
I was one of you.

763
01:01:01,525 --> 01:01:05,428
You're all brand
new and perfect.

764
01:01:05,462 --> 01:01:08,732
No mistakes,
no regrets.

765
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:13,570
<i>People look at you
and think of how</i>

766
01:01:13,603 --> 01:01:16,239
<i>wonderful your
future will be.</i>

767
01:01:16,273 --> 01:01:19,209
They want you to be
something special.

768
01:01:19,242 --> 01:01:24,347
Like a doctor or a lawyer.

769
01:01:24,381 --> 01:01:28,552
<i>I hate to tell you this,</i>

770
01:01:28,585 --> 01:01:31,721
but if you grow up here
you're more likely

771
01:01:31,755 --> 01:01:35,725
to wind up selling your
bodies on the streets

772
01:01:35,759 --> 01:01:42,699
<i>or shooting dope from dirty
needles in a bus stop.</i>

773
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:44,367
<i>And if you're successful,</i>

774
01:01:44,401 --> 01:01:48,939
you'll make money selling
junk to crack heads.

775
01:01:48,972 --> 01:01:53,610
And you won't think twice
about killing someone's wife

776
01:01:53,643 --> 01:01:56,413
because you won't even know

777
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:59,115
what was wrong
in the first place.

778
01:02:01,785 --> 01:02:10,493
Or, maybe you'll
end up like me...

779
01:02:12,629 --> 01:02:16,366
a hobo with a shotgun.

780
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:18,902
I hope you can do better.

781
01:02:21,938 --> 01:02:25,542
You are the future.

782
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:38,355
That's it!

783
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:44,594
I am sick and tired of
you fucking junkies!

784
01:03:26,102 --> 01:03:27,704
<i>What's going on?</i>

785
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:06,576
Abby!

786
01:04:56,593 --> 01:04:58,695
Abby.

787
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:01,164
Abby,
come on.

788
01:05:04,134 --> 01:05:05,935
Ah!
Oh!

789
01:06:40,463 --> 01:06:42,432
Psst.

790
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,802
You got a match?

791
01:07:15,431 --> 01:07:17,066
<i>Ah,
the Plague.</i>

792
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:19,536
You guys fucking rock!

793
01:07:19,569 --> 01:07:22,171
<i>Do you want to see him?</i>

794
01:07:22,205 --> 01:07:25,141
No,
I trust you guys.

795
01:07:25,174 --> 01:07:27,744
I can fuckin' smell
him from here.

796
01:07:27,777 --> 01:07:29,846
<i>Take him to the truck.</i>

797
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:34,984
You know, I almost
feel sad for you.

798
01:07:35,018 --> 01:07:37,420
You're in the shadow
of your brother.

799
01:07:40,023 --> 01:07:44,027
And you're just a
little tiny thug.

800
01:07:46,362 --> 01:07:48,531
A thug!

801
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:51,167
Listen you homeless
piece of shit.

802
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:54,370
I'm the only son
Drake has left!

803
01:07:54,404 --> 01:07:55,972
<i>And you know what that means?</i>

804
01:07:56,005 --> 01:07:58,908
That means I run
the fucking show!

805
01:07:58,942 --> 01:08:00,743
<i>I'm gonna show everybody.</i>

806
01:08:00,777 --> 01:08:03,446
They're gonna fear
the fuck out of me!

807
01:08:03,479 --> 01:08:05,949
<i>In fact, they're gonna
make comic books</i>

808
01:08:05,982 --> 01:08:09,018
out of my hate crimes!

809
01:08:09,052 --> 01:08:12,121
<i>I promise you when
I get out of here,</i>

810
01:08:12,155 --> 01:08:15,291
I'm gonna bite your face off.

811
01:08:17,727 --> 01:08:19,262
That's funny,

812
01:08:19,295 --> 01:08:20,930
because I promised myself.

813
01:08:20,964 --> 01:08:23,533
<i>I'm gonna bash
your fucking teeth in</i>

814
01:08:23,566 --> 01:08:26,369
and make a chainsaw
out of them.

815
01:08:27,403 --> 01:08:28,738
Fucker.

816
01:09:34,070 --> 01:09:35,972
Hold it right there lady.

817
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:38,341
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

818
01:09:38,374 --> 01:09:41,544
You want to know if I'm
homeless so you can kill me?

819
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:45,314
Yeah,
are ya?

820
01:09:46,683 --> 01:09:49,619
<i>Some people got a
bed to sleep on,</i>

821
01:09:49,652 --> 01:09:50,987
where they can crawl
under the covers

822
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:52,889
and have a good night's rest.

823
01:09:52,922 --> 01:09:56,092
But other people,
they don't got beds at all.

824
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:58,294
Instead they gotta
find an alleyway,

825
01:09:58,327 --> 01:10:02,465
<i>or a park bench where some
fucker's not gonna stab them.</i>

826
01:10:02,498 --> 01:10:03,966
<i>But just because
they don't got beds</i>

827
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,802
<i>doesn't mean
they're homeless.</i>

828
01:10:05,835 --> 01:10:09,939
Cause guess what, they've got
the biggest home of any of us.

829
01:10:09,972 --> 01:10:12,709
It's called the Streets!

830
01:10:12,742 --> 01:10:16,546
<i>And right now, we're all
standing in their home,</i>

831
01:10:16,579 --> 01:10:21,684
<i>so maybe we should show
them some god damn respect.</i>

832
01:10:21,718 --> 01:10:23,286
<i>If this is their home,</i>

833
01:10:23,319 --> 01:10:25,922
they've got a right to
keep it clean, don't they?

834
01:10:25,955 --> 01:10:28,624
<i>And sometimes on the streets,</i>

835
01:10:28,658 --> 01:10:31,427
a broom just ain't
gonna fucking cut it.

836
01:10:31,461 --> 01:10:34,330
That's when you
gotta get a shotgun!

837
01:10:34,363 --> 01:10:37,767
So if you want to
kill me, go ahead.

838
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,469
But I'll warn you.

839
01:10:39,502 --> 01:10:40,803
From where I'm standing,

840
01:10:40,837 --> 01:10:44,874
<i>things are looking
real fucking filthy!</i>

841
01:11:01,491 --> 01:11:04,093
Ladies and Gentlemen,

842
01:11:04,127 --> 01:11:07,730
welcome back to
the Drake show!

843
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:15,838
Yeah!

844
01:11:15,872 --> 01:11:18,040
That's how you cheer
you fucking creatures.

845
01:11:18,074 --> 01:11:19,642
Woo!

846
01:11:19,675 --> 01:11:21,677
Thank you.
Thank you.

847
01:11:21,711 --> 01:11:23,946
Thank you everybody.

848
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:27,183
Tonight I have a special
treat for you all.

849
01:11:27,216 --> 01:11:30,353
The culmination of one of
the bloodiest spectacles

850
01:11:30,386 --> 01:11:32,088
we have ever witnessed.

851
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:35,091
Everybody please
a round of applause

852
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:37,960
to the team that
made this possible.

853
01:11:37,994 --> 01:11:39,562
The Plague.

854
01:11:46,903 --> 01:11:52,241
<i>Now, I want you all to
meet our special guest.</i>

855
01:11:52,275 --> 01:11:54,944
<i>A man I'm sure you've
all heard about.</i>

856
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:57,547
Ladies and Gentlemen,
without further ado,

857
01:11:57,580 --> 01:12:00,616
let's bring on the
man of the hour.

858
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:06,622
<i>The one responsible for the
death of my favorite son.</i>

859
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:08,391
<i>And here he is,</i>

860
01:12:08,424 --> 01:12:10,593
a worthless,

861
01:12:10,626 --> 01:12:14,063
homeless piece of shit...

862
01:12:14,096 --> 01:12:16,699
Get your hands off me,
you demons!

863
01:12:16,732 --> 01:12:18,768
You're crushing my smokes.

864
01:12:18,801 --> 01:12:20,736
When God lost his son,

865
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:23,105
he knew he'd get him
back in a few days.

866
01:12:23,139 --> 01:12:25,341
<i>He never had to mourn,
not for a single second.</i>

867
01:12:25,374 --> 01:12:28,311
<i>But, I know I
can't get son back.</i>

868
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:30,346
So,
what does that make me,

869
01:12:30,379 --> 01:12:33,316
when I know more about pain

870
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:37,687
than the most powerful
being in the universe?

871
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:40,389
You're a fool.

872
01:12:40,423 --> 01:12:43,359
And a shitty father.

873
01:12:47,063 --> 01:12:49,232
Take him to the glory hole.

874
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:58,908
Look up at all those people.

875
01:12:58,941 --> 01:13:00,843
<i>I'm your God.</i>

876
01:13:00,877 --> 01:13:04,480
<i>They fear me more
than anything.</i>

877
01:13:04,513 --> 01:13:09,485
<i>And that fear is what saves
their lives everyday.</i>

878
01:13:09,518 --> 01:13:11,921
If I want something
from them I take it.

879
01:13:11,954 --> 01:13:13,956
<i>If they try to fight
back I kill them.</i>

880
01:13:13,990 --> 01:13:15,124
Fucker.

881
01:13:15,157 --> 01:13:17,193
They live to please me.

882
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:18,995
Because if they don't,

883
01:13:19,028 --> 01:13:21,264
I cut off their
fucking heads!

884
01:13:29,538 --> 01:13:32,975
Well,
now you look scared.

885
01:13:33,009 --> 01:13:35,411
Drake.

886
01:13:35,444 --> 01:13:38,447
Eventually,
evil...

887
01:13:38,481 --> 01:13:42,084
will turn against evil.

888
01:13:42,118 --> 01:13:44,420
It'll wipe itself out,

889
01:13:46,355 --> 01:13:50,226
<i>leaving nothing but wreckage.</i>

890
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:53,162
And fucked up memories.

891
01:13:56,032 --> 01:14:00,036
Every time I find
somebody like you,

892
01:14:00,069 --> 01:14:02,171
who wants to be a hero,

893
01:14:02,204 --> 01:14:05,508
<i>who wants to fuck
with me and stop my show,</i>

894
01:14:05,541 --> 01:14:10,413
I send em
straight to hell.

895
01:14:16,786 --> 01:14:18,187
What the...

896
01:14:19,655 --> 01:14:23,759
<i>Let him go Drake or I'll
chop your boy to pieces.</i>

897
01:14:23,793 --> 01:14:25,594
Abby.

898
01:14:25,628 --> 01:14:27,163
I mean it.

899
01:14:27,196 --> 01:14:30,633
I'll mulch this fucker
into the ground.

900
01:14:30,666 --> 01:14:33,069
What do you think?

901
01:14:33,102 --> 01:14:35,671
Replaceable.

902
01:14:35,705 --> 01:14:39,108
Dad, I'm the only
son you have left.

903
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:41,310
Quit fuckin' around.

904
01:14:41,344 --> 01:14:43,245
<i>Sorry boy,
but...</i>

905
01:14:43,279 --> 01:14:46,916
you've just never had
that much potential.

906
01:14:51,253 --> 01:14:54,790
No one upstages the Drake!

907
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:00,129
Do you see what I mean folks?

908
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:03,532
I provide you with nothing
but the highest quality,

909
01:15:03,566 --> 01:15:08,537
adrenaline filled
family entertainment.

910
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:32,228
Okay, Rip, let's get
us some Hobo head!

911
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:43,072
Oh!

912
01:15:46,409 --> 01:15:47,977
Let's go home.

913
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:49,478
Get this off me...

914
01:15:49,512 --> 01:15:52,014
You want to be the
star of this show?

915
01:15:52,048 --> 01:15:54,016
I'll make you shine.

916
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:57,053
You take your dirty hands
off her, you bastard.

917
01:15:57,086 --> 01:15:59,321
<i>I'd love to just shoot
her but my audience,</i>

918
01:15:59,355 --> 01:16:02,758
they expect more.

919
01:16:02,792 --> 01:16:04,093
Get your hands off me!

920
01:16:04,126 --> 01:16:05,294
Settle down,
honey.

921
01:16:05,327 --> 01:16:10,399
This will be the best
trick you ever gave.

922
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:13,836
Let's start with
a nose job, huh?

923
01:16:13,869 --> 01:16:15,838
No!

924
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:51,774
Get me out of this hole!

925
01:16:51,807 --> 01:16:53,909
<i>How?</i>

926
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:56,145
Pull my hair!

927
01:16:56,178 --> 01:16:57,646
<i>My hair.</i>

928
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:00,416
Pull it!
Pull it!

929
01:17:01,917 --> 01:17:04,320
Harder!
Harder!

930
01:17:13,529 --> 01:17:15,397
Untie me.

931
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:26,675
Demon's coming back.

932
01:17:40,956 --> 01:17:42,691
She killed Grinder.

933
01:17:42,725 --> 01:17:46,028
Now she must take his
place in the Plague.

934
01:17:50,366 --> 01:17:53,235
She's not going
anywhere buddy.

935
01:18:10,953 --> 01:18:13,923
Listen to me.

936
01:18:13,956 --> 01:18:16,525
You can't fall asleep now.

937
01:18:16,559 --> 01:18:18,294
You hear me?

938
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:32,841
There's one more
thing I have to do.

939
01:18:32,875 --> 01:18:36,712
No, I just wanna
go to the zoo

940
01:18:36,745 --> 01:18:42,384
and see the bears with you.

941
01:18:47,189 --> 01:18:50,726
Don't leave me.
Don't leave.

942
01:18:50,759 --> 01:18:54,163
Bears don't belong
in a zoo.

943
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:07,409
<i>Stupid fucking bitch.</i>

944
01:19:07,443 --> 01:19:10,145
<i>I'm gonna find her</i>

945
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:16,151
<i>and I'm gonna
fucking kill her...</i>

946
01:19:16,185 --> 01:19:18,687
<i>and I'm gonna cut his
fucking nuts off</i>

947
01:19:18,721 --> 01:19:21,290
<i>and stick it up
his fucking ass.</i>

948
01:19:26,895 --> 01:19:29,198
Show's over.

949
01:19:29,231 --> 01:19:33,602
You know, except
for killing my son,

950
01:19:33,636 --> 01:19:37,640
you made my town a
lot more interesting.

951
01:19:37,673 --> 01:19:40,109
You're so fucking crazy.

952
01:19:40,142 --> 01:19:41,777
I would have been
you're biggest fan,

953
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:43,879
you worthless street rat.

954
01:19:52,354 --> 01:19:57,593
Drop the fucking gun you
cocksucking garbage bag.

955
01:20:07,503 --> 01:20:09,772
Put it down and walk away.

956
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:12,441
This is your only
chance to leave alive!

957
01:20:14,076 --> 01:20:16,178
<i>You want to die for a town</i>

958
01:20:16,211 --> 01:20:18,714
that never gave
a fuck about you?

959
01:20:25,187 --> 01:20:27,456
<i>You'll never beat the Drake.</i>

960
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:29,892
This town worships me.

961
01:20:29,925 --> 01:20:32,528
Boys, if he shoots.
Kill the fucker.

962
01:20:34,229 --> 01:20:36,565
Whoa, what the
fuck are you doing!

963
01:20:36,598 --> 01:20:38,901
Get back inside everybody.

964
01:20:41,236 --> 01:20:44,073
<i>Put you weapons down!</i>

965
01:20:44,106 --> 01:20:47,776
<i>I said put the God
damn weapons down!</i>

966
01:20:49,712 --> 01:20:53,449
Okay, get rid of these
fucking animals now.

967
01:20:56,418 --> 01:20:58,887
You fuckers!

968
01:21:01,557 --> 01:21:04,893
<i>You and me are going
on a car ride to hell.</i>

969
01:21:06,829 --> 01:21:10,432
You're gonna miss me.

970
01:21:10,466 --> 01:21:13,001
You're riding shotgun.

971
01:21:13,035 --> 01:21:14,069
Nooooo!
