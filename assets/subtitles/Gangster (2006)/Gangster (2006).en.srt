00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,293
Give me your word, Usman

3
00:00:46,001 --> 00:00:49,561
If I'm caught, you will shoot
me at sunrise tomorrow

4
00:02:24,988 --> 00:02:26,046
Step back... move!

5
00:02:26,156 --> 00:02:28,487
One minute... hang on!

6
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:32,355
Why're you guys pushing
and jostling?

7
00:03:21,253 --> 00:03:23,049
Just a few more breaths

8
00:03:26,256 --> 00:03:29,052
You can't let me down today, Life

9
00:03:32,325 --> 00:03:34,918
I will finally have the bliss...

10
00:03:36,528 --> 00:03:41,054
I have craved for, all my life

11
00:03:43,365 --> 00:03:46,457
Just stand by me till
the break of dawn today

12
00:03:48,934 --> 00:03:51,401
If you had to desert me...

13
00:03:53,036 --> 00:03:55,868
why didn't you leave
me on the day...

14
00:03:55,938 --> 00:03:58,872
I found myself at the
crossroads of life?

15
00:04:10,046 --> 00:04:11,876
Get a hold on yourself

16
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:20,476
You'll fall, Simran. You've
had too much to drink

17
00:04:26,388 --> 00:04:29,879
Listen to me. Give me
your hand, Simran...

18
00:04:34,926 --> 00:04:37,985
Simran... Simran!

19
00:05:37,927 --> 00:05:40,326
I've landed you in trouble
too. Haven't I, Akash?

20
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,222
You were about to end
all the trouble today

21
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,990
What do you hold against me?

22
00:05:51,968 --> 00:05:54,299
For the first time I've
found a true friend...

23
00:05:55,303 --> 00:05:56,997
and you want to snatch
her away from me?

24
00:06:00,306 --> 00:06:01,795
You were the who was drowning,
but it...

25
00:06:01,873 --> 00:06:03,271
...was I who was dying.
You know that?

26
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:08,069
Akash, I've never cared for my life

27
00:06:09,877 --> 00:06:12,811
But you've increased its importance
by saving it today

28
00:06:16,848 --> 00:06:18,815
For the first time I've
begun to feel...

29
00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:20,941
that my life and death make
a difference to someone

30
00:06:21,017 --> 00:06:22,211
Oh shut up!

31
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,150
It's two months since we met, right?

32
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:34,015
Sometimes I think I understand
you very well

33
00:06:35,359 --> 00:06:37,883
And there are times when I think
I don't know you at all

34
00:06:40,328 --> 00:06:41,760
Why do I get the feeling
that you're...

35
00:06:41,829 --> 00:06:43,887
...suppressing something
in your heart?

36
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:48,094
It keeps trying to come out...

37
00:06:48,165 --> 00:06:51,395
and you always drink
to keep it bottled up

38
00:06:54,836 --> 00:06:58,964
What are you hiding from me,
Simran? What is it?

39
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,275
I don't want to hide from you what's
going on in my heart right now

40
00:07:06,975 --> 00:07:08,101
What?

41
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:12,767
I don't intend to spend an entire
lifetime in this hospital

42
00:07:12,846 --> 00:07:14,107
Will you take me home?

43
00:07:19,783 --> 00:07:20,806
All right

44
00:07:34,858 --> 00:07:35,915
Akash, stop right here

45
00:07:47,798 --> 00:07:49,059
What's wrong with you, Simran?

46
00:07:49,799 --> 00:07:52,733
You get off at just about any
corner or square every day

47
00:07:53,801 --> 00:07:55,961
It's either this road,
or some other one

48
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:00,167
Let me drop you home atleast today.
You're not keeping well

49
00:08:00,238 --> 00:08:02,728
Akash, I'm okay. I'll go on my own

50
00:08:06,342 --> 00:08:10,743
I'm still a stranger to you, right?
- Why do you say such things?

51
00:08:10,811 --> 00:08:12,072
That's not true, Akash

52
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,741
I'm always afraid that I'll drop
you some place, someday...

53
00:08:18,815 --> 00:08:21,078
and never see you ever again

54
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:24,276
Stop talking nonsense. Nothing of
the sort's going to happen, Akash

55
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:29,343
Okay, I'll skip the nonsense.
But I have two conditions

56
00:08:29,788 --> 00:08:32,756
One, you won't drink again

57
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:33,949
Two?

58
00:08:36,358 --> 00:08:39,757
You'll come to hear me sing
this evening. At the club

59
00:08:39,826 --> 00:08:43,226
I can't guarantee the first. But
I'll surely come to the club

60
00:08:43,295 --> 00:08:44,693
May I go now?

61
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:48,025
Hello...?

62
00:10:51,298 --> 00:10:52,696
Drunk again?

63
00:10:54,767 --> 00:10:55,961
When are you coming home?

64
00:10:58,035 --> 00:10:59,695
You weren't at home last night

65
00:11:06,206 --> 00:11:07,695
Who'd I come home for?

66
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:14,700
Who is it that's waiting for me?
You call just once a week...

67
00:11:14,744 --> 00:11:17,041
you have any idea how I spend
the rest of the six days?

68
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:23,713
Whatever happens, I have to wait for
the phone to ring to talk to you...

69
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,841
and I'm not even supposed
to phone you!

70
00:11:28,786 --> 00:11:30,719
Every time I talk
to you, I wonder...

71
00:11:30,787 --> 00:11:33,721
if I'll ever get to
hear your voice again

72
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,848
If something happens to you...

73
00:11:37,924 --> 00:11:39,982
Everybody's got to die, Simran

74
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:42,788
But I'm not dying
without meeting you

75
00:11:47,162 --> 00:11:48,857
I've got some important
business to wrap up

76
00:11:49,696 --> 00:11:52,061
I'm taking a ship to Dubai
tomorrow morning

77
00:11:57,001 --> 00:11:58,661
Take care

78
00:11:59,736 --> 00:12:00,793
Daya...

79
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:05,229
You are my night, my dawn...

80
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:08,203
you are my day

81
00:15:09,606 --> 00:15:12,664
You are my God, my universe...

82
00:15:12,774 --> 00:15:16,174
you are my world

83
00:15:16,643 --> 00:15:20,578
To me, you are Time...

84
00:15:20,646 --> 00:15:24,045
and I'm every moment for you

85
00:15:24,114 --> 00:15:32,575
How on earth can you ever
live apart from me?

86
00:15:48,594 --> 00:15:52,528
You are my night, my dawn...

87
00:15:52,596 --> 00:15:55,792
you are my day

88
00:15:56,598 --> 00:15:59,930
You are my God, my universe...

89
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,991
you are my world

90
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:07,594
To me, you are Time...

91
00:16:07,671 --> 00:16:11,538
and I'm every moment for you

92
00:16:11,607 --> 00:16:19,840
How on earth can you ever
live apart from me?

93
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,552
I don't know why, but without
even realising it...

94
00:16:43,557 --> 00:16:45,615
It was in a moment of weakness...

95
00:16:46,659 --> 00:16:50,923
that I met Akash at this very
restaurant about a month ago

96
00:16:51,995 --> 00:16:56,760
I can't believe I've grown so close
to him in such a little time

97
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,627
Your eyes, misty...

98
00:17:03,702 --> 00:17:07,500
your face, the mirror
of your heart

99
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:15,030
You are a beautiful sad story

100
00:17:19,577 --> 00:17:23,033
Your eyes, misty...

101
00:17:23,112 --> 00:17:27,012
your face, the mirror of your heart

102
00:17:27,581 --> 00:17:34,916
You are a beautiful sad story

103
00:17:34,986 --> 00:17:38,852
What causes agony to your heart...

104
00:17:38,921 --> 00:17:42,719
tell me

105
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:50,792
Why are you so angry
with yourself?

106
00:18:32,517 --> 00:18:39,477
Not just my eyes, you
are etched on my heart

107
00:18:39,687 --> 00:18:47,557
You are the reason why I live

108
00:18:52,028 --> 00:18:59,090
Not just my eyes, you are
etched on my heart

109
00:18:59,498 --> 00:19:06,924
You are the reason why I live

110
00:19:07,503 --> 00:19:11,028
Your laughter...

111
00:19:11,505 --> 00:19:14,961
your charms...

112
00:19:15,507 --> 00:19:23,434
are so different from the others

113
00:19:38,953 --> 00:19:42,785
You are my night,
you are my morn...

114
00:19:42,855 --> 00:19:46,448
you are my day

115
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:50,520
You are my God, my universe...

116
00:19:50,659 --> 00:19:53,991
you are my world

117
00:19:54,062 --> 00:19:58,121
To me, you are Time...

118
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:01,726
and I'm every moment for you

119
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:10,464
How on earth can you ever
live apart from me?

120
00:20:48,925 --> 00:20:50,755
Thank you, thank you

121
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,966
I didn't think you'd
be coming today,

122
00:21:08,502 --> 00:21:09,968
I didn't think I'd be coming either,

123
00:21:14,772 --> 00:21:17,638
Everybody loved your song.
- Yes, sure,

124
00:21:19,475 --> 00:21:20,907
How about the one I sang it for?

125
00:21:23,844 --> 00:21:26,641
Akash, you get so utterly
corny at times,

126
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:37,916
Thank you.
- What for?

127
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:41,383
For accepting both my conditions,

128
00:22:14,905 --> 00:22:16,895
Akash, I got to leave.
- Where to, Simran?

129
00:22:16,973 --> 00:22:19,532
I get paid for 3 hours and I've
sung just one number yet,

130
00:22:19,608 --> 00:22:21,939
You can stay, Akash. I got to leave,

131
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:24,703
Where are you going? I had
plans for this evening,

132
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,403
Some other time, Akash.
- Wait, Simran...,

133
00:22:27,478 --> 00:22:29,411
and why're you taking the backdoor?
- Akash!

134
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,673
Coming, sir,

135
00:22:33,481 --> 00:22:35,415
Stay here, I'll meet the
manager and return,

136
00:22:42,853 --> 00:22:45,343
Akash, this is Mr. Raghavan.
- Hello, Mr. Akash,

137
00:22:45,688 --> 00:22:47,348
I've heard so much about you,

138
00:22:47,856 --> 00:22:49,914
Your songs are being discussed
even in India,

139
00:22:50,858 --> 00:22:52,848
Meet my wife.
- Hello,

140
00:22:53,859 --> 00:22:56,349
Please sit down, I'll join
you in a minute... yes?

141
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,433
Can I have a bit of whisky? Please?

142
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,738
Why're you doing all this, Simran?

143
00:26:27,776 --> 00:26:29,675
Why do you love me so much, Akash?

144
00:26:32,779 --> 00:26:36,269
I have a lot of reasons
to drink like this,

145
00:26:37,348 --> 00:26:41,749
But you have no reason to fall
in love with a girl like me,

146
00:26:43,752 --> 00:26:47,208
I can't even stand on
my own two feet...,

147
00:26:47,253 --> 00:26:49,652
how will I ever be able to stand
by you through a lifetime?

148
00:26:49,755 --> 00:26:51,517
I'll take care of you,

149
00:26:53,257 --> 00:26:55,622
I know, you don't want to
tell anyone your story,

150
00:26:56,725 --> 00:26:59,488
I know, Simran...
- What do you know?

151
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:02,487
You know nothing, Akash,

152
00:27:04,829 --> 00:27:09,287
You know, had Raghavan caught
sight of me today...,

153
00:27:09,365 --> 00:27:12,231
my story would've come to an end,

154
00:27:13,302 --> 00:27:15,700
Raghavan? That guy who works
at the Indian embassy?

155
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:19,704
The bastard's an intelligence
agent. He's here on a mission,

156
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:24,238
Mission...? ,

157
00:27:25,274 --> 00:27:28,902
Don't you always ask me, Akash,
why I drink so much?

158
00:27:38,748 --> 00:27:40,510
This is why,

159
00:27:47,687 --> 00:27:50,177
I somehow managed to escape
Raghavan's bullets,

160
00:27:50,388 --> 00:27:53,184
But this poor child
died right there,

161
00:27:54,724 --> 00:27:57,283
I couldn't even talk
to him one last time,

162
00:27:58,426 --> 00:27:59,586
Who are you?

163
00:28:03,262 --> 00:28:05,195
Who, except a criminal,
could I be...,

164
00:28:05,263 --> 00:28:07,730
to run away from the
police bullets?

165
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:11,789
What... what crime have
you committed?

166
00:28:14,268 --> 00:28:17,202
I've committed the crime of falling
in love with a gangster,

167
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:20,533
I've committed the crime
of living with him,

168
00:28:22,272 --> 00:28:23,330
Gangster? ,

169
00:28:25,207 --> 00:28:26,264
Daya,

170
00:28:29,242 --> 00:28:33,438
Well? The mere mention of his name
makes you break into a sweat?

171
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,203
I've spent 5 whole years with him,

172
00:28:41,483 --> 00:28:44,143
He's someone the entire
police in India hates...,

173
00:28:44,217 --> 00:28:47,151
and I've committed the crime
of falling in love with him,

174
00:28:51,655 --> 00:28:54,350
I don't care if I'm caught, Akash,

175
00:28:55,657 --> 00:28:58,648
But I know, if I'm caught...,

176
00:28:59,226 --> 00:29:01,386
perhaps he will be caught too,

177
00:29:03,195 --> 00:29:06,651
It's not today, I've always
tried to protect Daya,

178
00:29:07,764 --> 00:29:11,163
Even on the day he got straight
to my house...,

179
00:29:11,232 --> 00:29:13,165
running away from the police,

180
00:29:15,668 --> 00:29:17,760
There were 300 families
in that locality,

181
00:29:19,236 --> 00:29:25,332
But I don't know why destiny pushed
him through the doors of my house,

182
00:29:50,687 --> 00:29:52,177
Did you see someone coming here?
- No,

183
00:29:52,788 --> 00:29:55,187
There's nobody, sir.
- No? Let's go,

184
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:12,191
You want to die? They must
still be out there,

185
00:30:13,233 --> 00:30:15,325
You can spend the night
here if you wish,

186
00:31:07,229 --> 00:31:09,752
This chap who was mopping the
floor with me that day...,

187
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:13,494
I later got to know, was
a very dreaded gangster,

188
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:17,156
Whatever he meant to the world...,

189
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,658
what I saw in his eyes that day...,

190
00:31:20,736 --> 00:31:24,501
made me feel that he too
was as lonely as I was,

191
00:31:26,506 --> 00:31:28,370
No thank you, no good-bye...,

192
00:31:28,441 --> 00:31:32,170
he didn't say a word to me when
he left early next morning,

193
00:31:33,677 --> 00:31:36,667
I could feel his silence
for several days,

194
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:42,713
It was more than a month
since he had left...,

195
00:31:45,616 --> 00:31:47,446
but I still couldn't get over him,

196
00:31:49,152 --> 00:31:52,119
And one day, he landed
up at my door,

197
00:31:53,154 --> 00:31:54,450
I wasn't in,

198
00:31:56,622 --> 00:31:59,112
He made enquiries with
my neighbours and...,

199
00:31:59,191 --> 00:32:04,649
and he straightaway
got to my workplace,

200
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:01,490
He then started coming frequently
to my dance-bar,

201
00:33:05,694 --> 00:33:10,254
He always took one particular
table with his back to me,

202
00:33:11,597 --> 00:33:16,089
Working at the dance-bar, I had
seen several drunkards...,

203
00:33:16,166 --> 00:33:22,762
stripping me with their eyes.
In Daya's eyes, however...,

204
00:33:22,836 --> 00:33:24,427
I saw respect for myself,

205
00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:32,097
With him, I thought I was adequately
clothed, even in skimpy clothing.

206
00:33:32,542 --> 00:33:36,101
He always looked at me silently,

207
00:33:37,178 --> 00:33:39,441
He never uttered a word,

208
00:33:40,646 --> 00:33:43,546
Maybe he wouldn't ever.
If it wasn't for...,

209
00:34:16,065 --> 00:34:17,122
Let's go home,

210
00:34:18,567 --> 00:34:22,661
The first word he
uttered was "home",

211
00:34:24,403 --> 00:34:28,064
It was as if my dreams
were taking shape,

212
00:34:29,573 --> 00:34:32,734
I felt as if he was taking
my hand, never to leave it,

213
00:34:34,109 --> 00:34:40,067
I don't know whether I let myself
go with him... or my necessities,

214
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:43,006
But I got to his place,

215
00:35:15,431 --> 00:35:20,560
You know something, Akash?
In broad daylight...,

216
00:35:20,634 --> 00:35:23,624
I haven't felt safer even with the
so-called respectable men...,

217
00:35:23,702 --> 00:35:28,569
as safe as I felt that night,
in a gangster's house,

218
00:35:33,541 --> 00:35:35,531
I thought I had found
a world of my own,

219
00:35:38,377 --> 00:35:43,607
My dream of starting a family
was really coming true,

220
00:35:44,013 --> 00:35:49,574
How was I to know that as usual, my
happiness would be short-lived?

221
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:52,984
I'll see... who is it?
- Milkman,

222
00:36:36,075 --> 00:36:39,009
There was no stopping after that,

223
00:36:40,111 --> 00:36:41,941
I was looking for one house...,

224
00:36:42,446 --> 00:36:45,004
and destiny kept changing
my house everyday,

225
00:36:46,014 --> 00:36:50,244
At times it was a footpath. At
times, a room in a 5-star hotel,

226
00:36:52,451 --> 00:36:55,010
We used to spend our
nights in hiding,

227
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:00,079
He always had his share of
enemies in the underworld,

228
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:04,950
But even those that considered
him to be a friend...,

229
00:37:07,025 --> 00:37:08,151
had turned his enemies,

230
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,421
Brother, Khan-Saheb is here,

231
00:37:12,562 --> 00:37:13,960
Go inside,

232
00:37:19,032 --> 00:37:20,089
Sit down...

233
00:37:23,001 --> 00:37:24,468
you must be tired of running

234
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,565
He was barely 12 or 13 years old
when he came to me asking for a job

235
00:37:37,576 --> 00:37:40,907
Everybody said, he was a kid,
not to make him part of my gang

236
00:37:41,978 --> 00:37:45,912
But no, sir. I trusted him

237
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,912
And he never broke my trust

238
00:37:54,251 --> 00:37:57,946
Boys in the gang going out to kill
would first ask the means of escape

239
00:37:58,954 --> 00:38:01,922
This guy did his job; he never
thought of how he'd return

240
00:38:03,523 --> 00:38:07,184
Even the big guns were scared
of him. You know why?

241
00:38:08,526 --> 00:38:10,322
Because he wasn't scared of death

242
00:38:13,428 --> 00:38:15,588
And ever since you have
entered his life...

243
00:38:15,996 --> 00:38:17,929
he has started loving life

244
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,933
Like a dog with its tail
between its legs...

245
00:38:25,001 --> 00:38:26,127
he's running from place to place

246
00:38:27,436 --> 00:38:30,427
He has forgotten what a goddamned
nuisance women are

247
00:38:32,972 --> 00:38:35,940
Have fun, use them and dump them!

248
00:38:37,008 --> 00:38:39,941
If you wear her around your neck,
she'll slit your throat!

249
00:38:41,477 --> 00:38:43,535
Make him see reason

250
00:38:44,278 --> 00:38:47,212
In our business, there's
lust. There's no love

251
00:38:47,947 --> 00:38:50,414
Like my mentor, Sikander.
What happened to him?

252
00:38:50,482 --> 00:38:52,346
He became a bloody dog
for the sake of a girl

253
00:38:53,383 --> 00:38:56,215
He took a Qazi to the broad's
house; she double-crossed him

254
00:38:56,285 --> 00:39:01,220
His body was riddled with bullets.
And I had to shoot the bitch later

255
00:39:03,922 --> 00:39:07,880
If my kid is being stupid,
if he's making a mistake...

256
00:39:07,958 --> 00:39:09,891
I'll have to do the same thing again

257
00:39:11,393 --> 00:39:15,020
Hey, you're a whore
who works at a bar

258
00:39:15,095 --> 00:39:17,892
You won't let go of him so easily.

259
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,561
But you can atleast
reason with him...

260
00:39:20,632 --> 00:39:21,893
to leave you. Else,
I'll have to do...

261
00:39:21,965 --> 00:39:25,365
...to you what I did
to Sikander's broad

262
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,372
Now I know why boys leave their
fathers for the sake of women

263
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:47,911
You have lost your father today

264
00:39:50,514 --> 00:39:52,310
You're on your own now

265
00:39:54,516 --> 00:39:56,245
So look after yourself

266
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,112
I was terrified

267
00:40:05,423 --> 00:40:07,912
But I had implicit faith in Daya

268
00:40:11,526 --> 00:40:15,460
Akash, all my dreams were
about to come true

269
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:23,058
I waited to see fulfilled a dream
that I had for several years

270
00:40:25,433 --> 00:40:27,333
And that is why you married Daya?

271
00:40:33,004 --> 00:40:37,462
To dream and to see the
dream being fulfilled...

272
00:40:38,541 --> 00:40:39,939
are entirely different things

273
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:47,873
Daya loved me so much, he didn't
even touch me before our marriage

274
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:52,981
Our marriage... that
never took place

275
00:40:54,383 --> 00:40:55,873
The kid then?

276
00:40:57,952 --> 00:40:59,009
It was hired

277
00:41:05,389 --> 00:41:10,882
There is no dearth of poor,
helpless orphans in the world

278
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,893
I pretended to be a mother too

279
00:41:18,196 --> 00:41:20,492
But I don't know what
it was about Bittu...

280
00:41:20,964 --> 00:41:24,558
when I met him, I felt as if...

281
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:31,563
I were his real mother...
as if he were really my son

282
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:40,037
We needed passports
to leave the country

283
00:41:40,108 --> 00:41:43,234
And to get those passports,
we needed to be a family

284
00:41:43,309 --> 00:41:47,971
That's it. Bittu became part
of our so-called family

285
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:05,916
I thought then that I had everything

286
00:42:07,456 --> 00:42:12,187
A husband, a son, a family

287
00:42:13,926 --> 00:42:16,985
I wanted to make this fantasy
the picture of my life

288
00:42:18,362 --> 00:42:22,854
And thus, I never wanted Bittu
to be separated from me

289
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,860
Daya was changing too

290
00:42:26,933 --> 00:42:30,527
This man couldn't bear to see even
a drop of the child's blood

291
00:42:31,369 --> 00:42:32,859
Who could've imagined
it was this man's...

292
00:42:32,937 --> 00:42:35,268
. profession to indulge in bloodshed?

293
00:42:36,372 --> 00:42:43,468
As they say, you can get rid of
everything except your shadow

294
00:42:44,876 --> 00:42:48,276
And Daya's shadow was
far longer than himself

295
00:42:48,878 --> 00:42:52,142
I'm terribly scared, Daya.
- There's nothing to be scared of

296
00:42:52,214 --> 00:42:53,840
Why not, Daya?

297
00:42:54,949 --> 00:42:57,814
I don't know whether I will
ever have you in my lifetime

298
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:00,215
But I don't want to lose Bittu

299
00:43:01,152 --> 00:43:04,278
Nothing will happen to Bittu. It's
dangerous for us to live in India

300
00:43:04,887 --> 00:43:08,151
There are informers everywhere.
If we don't take Bittu along...

301
00:43:08,223 --> 00:43:11,281
it's impossible to get to Dubai.
- You said we'd never use Bittu!

302
00:43:11,357 --> 00:43:13,824
I also said I'd never let
anything happen to Bittu

303
00:43:13,892 --> 00:43:16,223
It's my chest that'll take
the bullets. Not his

304
00:44:05,821 --> 00:44:06,980
Mummy!

305
00:46:44,874 --> 00:46:46,000
Thank you

306
00:46:52,712 --> 00:46:54,076
Won't you come in?

307
00:47:51,978 --> 00:47:54,844
Simran, your past is
like these four walls

308
00:47:55,879 --> 00:47:57,743
You have managed to step out...

309
00:47:58,681 --> 00:48:00,648
but you've left the keys inside

310
00:48:07,653 --> 00:48:10,916
Simran, life is goading
you towards a new goal

311
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,781
But you're still tied to the past

312
00:48:16,725 --> 00:48:18,658
I know you want to
get on with life...

313
00:48:18,993 --> 00:48:21,654
but you're afraid, you might
lose your dreams on the way

314
00:48:25,997 --> 00:48:27,190
Open your eyes, Simran

315
00:48:28,264 --> 00:48:31,959
Your dreams are here with you...
right in front of you

316
00:48:34,001 --> 00:48:36,798
You don't need to look back again
and again to be happy, Simran

317
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:42,865
You have shed enough tears for
things that did not happen

318
00:48:44,106 --> 00:48:46,266
Atleast let what is about to
happen reach its conclusion?

319
00:48:53,111 --> 00:48:57,603
Simran, you have every right to live

320
00:48:59,115 --> 00:49:00,809
You have every right to dream

321
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:07,142
I'll give you all the happiness,
I'll fulfill all your dreams

322
00:49:10,687 --> 00:49:13,621
Because now that I've
heard your story...

323
00:49:14,956 --> 00:49:16,617
I've begun to love you
more than ever before

324
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:17,714
I love you, Simran

325
00:51:18,657 --> 00:51:23,888
Every moment, the distances
between us begin to melt

326
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:29,123
In the fires of passion
burns the dew

327
00:51:30,697 --> 00:51:40,567
The sun sets with desires...

328
00:51:40,635 --> 00:51:45,900
In what fires burns the dew?

329
00:52:09,184 --> 00:52:10,776
Hello,
- Reception

330
00:52:11,652 --> 00:52:12,983
Please try this number again

331
00:52:13,054 --> 00:52:16,044
For the past three days, I've
been trying this number

332
00:52:16,122 --> 00:52:18,715
Why don't you understand?
All you Indians are the same!

333
00:52:35,932 --> 00:52:37,660
Your eyes...

334
00:52:38,667 --> 00:52:39,997
show me...

335
00:52:41,136 --> 00:52:43,729
dreams...

336
00:52:43,804 --> 00:52:45,862
of the stars

337
00:52:46,605 --> 00:52:49,539
On your lips...

338
00:52:49,607 --> 00:52:51,870
is written...

339
00:52:51,941 --> 00:52:54,534
what you say...

340
00:52:54,576 --> 00:52:56,839
in signs

341
00:52:58,578 --> 00:53:03,536
In a caravan of dreams,
the night moves on

342
00:53:03,882 --> 00:53:09,545
What fire is it in
which burns the dew?

343
00:53:59,012 --> 00:54:03,810
This evening, I'm going astray...

344
00:54:03,914 --> 00:54:09,009
with you in my arms

345
00:54:10,018 --> 00:54:12,507
Must I touch you...

346
00:54:12,585 --> 00:54:15,018
or keep you...

347
00:54:15,086 --> 00:54:20,522
hidden in my eyes?

348
00:54:21,857 --> 00:54:27,521
Shy. Fumbling...

349
00:54:27,594 --> 00:54:31,995
what fire is it that
burns the dew?

350
00:54:33,564 --> 00:54:37,828
Every moment, the distances
between us begin to melt

351
00:54:38,567 --> 00:54:43,467
In what fires of passion
burns the dew

352
00:54:43,535 --> 00:54:54,600
Why does the sun set
on our desires...?

353
00:54:54,675 --> 00:54:59,940
In what fires burns the dew?

354
00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:47,895
Akash...

355
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,766
Akash...

356
00:56:04,513 --> 00:56:06,446
Will you forget me
like this someday?

357
00:57:04,913 --> 00:57:07,904
He's dead

358
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:51,365
The doctors say she's out of danger,

359
01:01:09,013 --> 01:01:10,138
Daya!

360
01:01:11,415 --> 01:01:13,143
Daya! Don't hit him!

361
01:01:15,884 --> 01:01:21,183
Let him go! Leave him alone!

362
01:01:21,253 --> 01:01:23,447
Let go... it's not his mistake!

363
01:01:25,922 --> 01:01:27,855
He hasn't made any mistake!

364
01:01:30,458 --> 01:01:31,890
Daya, let him go!

365
01:01:53,304 --> 01:01:56,794
Let go of my hand! Leave
me alone, Daya!

366
01:01:57,139 --> 01:02:00,800
Let me go, Daya! Please
let me go, Daya,

367
01:02:00,841 --> 01:02:02,398
Let me go, Daya!

368
01:02:02,842 --> 01:02:04,809
Daya, leave my hand!

369
01:02:06,278 --> 01:02:07,767
Leave my hand, I say!

370
01:02:26,822 --> 01:02:32,315
Akash...

371
01:02:44,898 --> 01:02:47,058
Talk to me! Why aren't
you talking to me?

372
01:02:47,133 --> 01:02:50,260
What right did you have to hit him?

373
01:02:50,335 --> 01:02:53,996
Jealous? Jealous to see me
with another man today...?

374
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:55,730
Where were you when I
gave up everything...,

375
01:02:55,804 --> 01:02:58,397
and wanted to settle down with you?

376
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:02,307
You locked me up in that house
and went away then!

377
01:03:03,843 --> 01:03:06,776
And when I want to open the
window for some fresh air...,

378
01:03:06,810 --> 01:03:09,209
you find that bad? Why
must I wait for you?

379
01:03:09,278 --> 01:03:13,736
What have you given me except
fear and terror, Daya?

380
01:03:13,814 --> 01:03:16,941
I thought Bittu's death
would change you,

381
01:03:18,250 --> 01:03:21,741
But you can never change,
Daya! Never!

382
01:03:21,818 --> 01:03:24,411
You were a gangster and you
are still a gangster!

383
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:28,084
I can't spend a lifetime
with a gangster!

384
01:03:28,156 --> 01:03:29,747
I can't spend the rest of
my life with a gang...,

385
01:03:29,823 --> 01:03:34,315
which is the stained with
the blood innocents!

386
01:03:34,392 --> 01:03:37,382
What are you going to get out
of killing Akash, Daya?

387
01:03:37,861 --> 01:03:39,725
Talk to me! I'm the one
you must talk to!

388
01:03:39,761 --> 01:03:43,820
You want to know whether I
love him? Yes, I love him!

389
01:03:43,930 --> 01:03:46,693
He's the only one who can
fulfill all my dreams!

390
01:03:46,765 --> 01:03:49,699
He's the one who took care
of me after you went away!

391
01:03:49,767 --> 01:03:52,291
He's the one who brought
a smile to my lips!

392
01:03:52,768 --> 01:03:57,294
He's the one I truly love! Only
he can fulfill my dreams!

393
01:05:24,719 --> 01:05:25,742
If...,

394
01:05:28,288 --> 01:05:29,879
you really...,

395
01:05:33,758 --> 01:05:35,088
are in love with Akash...,

396
01:05:37,193 --> 01:05:38,819
I will not stop you,

397
01:05:59,171 --> 01:06:00,899
I've given you a lot of sorrow,

398
01:06:04,241 --> 01:06:07,640
But if you have ever loved me...,

399
01:06:07,709 --> 01:06:11,109
even a wee bit...,

400
01:06:12,979 --> 01:06:14,775
give me one chance, please,

401
01:06:20,183 --> 01:06:21,672
I'm a changed man,

402
01:06:24,752 --> 01:06:28,277
Today, this moment... I'm willing
to give up everything,

403
01:06:34,724 --> 01:06:38,249
But if you leave me...,

404
01:06:39,727 --> 01:06:41,057
I'm going to die,

405
01:06:43,662 --> 01:06:49,598
I won't be able to live, Simran,

406
01:06:54,853 --> 01:06:59,254
I... I won't be able
to live, Simran!

407
01:07:11,624 --> 01:07:16,423
I won't be able to live
anymore! I won't!

408
01:07:50,313 --> 01:07:51,506
Usman...?

409
01:08:09,323 --> 01:08:10,585
Daya, go away!

410
01:08:14,326 --> 01:08:16,759
Listen to me, Daya! Go away!

411
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:20,521
Go away, Daya! Listen to me!

412
01:08:22,463 --> 01:08:23,657
Run, Daya!

413
01:08:35,303 --> 01:08:36,361
Get him. Quick!

414
01:08:43,275 --> 01:08:44,536
C'mon! Move it!

415
01:09:13,257 --> 01:09:14,281
Shit! ,

416
01:09:35,737 --> 01:09:39,762
Moist memories, moist nights,
moist eyes...

417
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:43,739
what makes my eyes moist?

418
01:09:54,314 --> 01:09:56,247
Dreams in my eyes...

419
01:09:56,315 --> 01:09:58,441
make me laugh one moment,
make me cry the other...

420
01:09:58,516 --> 01:10:01,711
what vacuum is this...?

421
01:10:16,625 --> 01:10:19,286
Nobody knows...

422
01:10:19,327 --> 01:10:22,887
what life I lead...

423
01:10:23,329 --> 01:10:29,596
my story, incomplete

424
01:10:32,334 --> 01:10:38,271
what life I lead...

425
01:10:38,338 --> 01:10:45,536
my story, incomplete

426
01:10:50,577 --> 01:10:52,373
Sleepy, awake...

427
01:10:52,478 --> 01:10:54,672
your eyes, teary...

428
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:59,215
for my sake

429
01:11:09,288 --> 01:11:11,551
My Maker, angry. Everything,
lost...

430
01:11:11,622 --> 01:11:13,681
heartbroken, without you...

431
01:11:13,757 --> 01:11:17,213
how shall I accept life?

432
01:11:31,766 --> 01:11:33,824
Nobody knows...

433
01:11:34,301 --> 01:11:39,828
what life I lead...

434
01:11:40,238 --> 01:11:44,502
my story, incomplete

435
01:11:47,241 --> 01:11:53,666
what life I lead...

436
01:11:53,745 --> 01:12:00,409
my story, incomplete

437
01:12:30,833 --> 01:12:34,631
Moist memories, moist nights,
moist eyes...

438
01:12:34,668 --> 01:12:38,659
what makes my eyes moist?

439
01:12:53,644 --> 01:12:55,543
Nobody knows...

440
01:12:55,679 --> 01:13:01,775
what life I lead...

441
01:13:02,249 --> 01:13:06,513
my story, incomplete

442
01:13:07,219 --> 01:13:12,280
Nobody knows, nobody
has a clue...

443
01:13:13,655 --> 01:13:18,147
of the incomplete
story my life is

444
01:13:18,225 --> 01:13:20,488
Nobody knows...

445
01:13:20,559 --> 01:13:24,687
what life I lead...

446
01:13:24,761 --> 01:13:29,219
my story, unfinished

447
01:13:45,607 --> 01:13:51,099
My story... incomplete

448
01:14:20,459 --> 01:14:21,652
Simran...,

449
01:14:24,461 --> 01:14:27,793
it's said one must begin
where one strayed off...

450
01:14:27,863 --> 01:14:29,454
if you wish to tread the right
path all over again,

451
01:14:31,632 --> 01:14:36,794
I too wish to go back to India.
To my village. With you,

452
01:14:39,435 --> 01:14:41,368
You know where my village is?

453
01:14:42,704 --> 01:14:44,102
It's near Kashmir,

454
01:14:46,606 --> 01:14:50,734
When it snowed in winter, all
roads used to be blocked,

455
01:14:52,409 --> 01:14:55,070
My mother was employed
to clear the snow,

456
01:14:57,145 --> 01:14:58,669
Two rupees,

457
01:15:01,581 --> 01:15:04,413
To earn two rupees,
she used to pray...,

458
01:15:04,483 --> 01:15:06,416
that it may snow again, so
she could have employment,

459
01:15:09,152 --> 01:15:11,085
There was so much of peace
in those two rupees,

460
01:15:12,620 --> 01:15:18,113
After several years today,
I could sleep in peace...

461
01:15:18,191 --> 01:15:20,454
after earning an honest living,

462
01:15:27,429 --> 01:15:29,089
And it's all thanks to you,

463
01:15:34,699 --> 01:15:39,225
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't
even have known...

464
01:15:40,102 --> 01:15:44,036
what sleep for the honest means,

465
01:15:48,140 --> 01:15:50,539
I wish to live like this
all my life, Simran,

466
01:15:52,075 --> 01:15:53,099
With you,

467
01:15:56,377 --> 01:15:59,038
But before starting again
on the path of honesty...

468
01:15:59,112 --> 01:16:01,306
I'll have one last bad thing to do,

469
01:16:03,114 --> 01:16:05,240
I'll have to get hold of fake
passports for you and me,

470
01:16:06,650 --> 01:16:08,048
I'm going to Seoul,

471
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:15,053
One last time. After that...,

472
01:16:15,121 --> 01:16:17,588
you can say the bad man
in me is dead for good,

473
01:16:50,474 --> 01:16:52,566
Hello... hello?

474
01:16:57,044 --> 01:16:58,101
Simran...?

475
01:16:59,246 --> 01:17:00,371
Akash...

476
01:17:01,547 --> 01:17:06,005
Thank God, Simran! I looked so
much for you... where are you?

477
01:17:09,084 --> 01:17:10,608
I want to meet you just once, Simran

478
01:17:12,086 --> 01:17:14,019
I promise, I'll never try
to meet you ever again

479
01:17:16,355 --> 01:17:18,015
Simran, please don't do this to me

480
01:17:19,357 --> 01:17:23,018
Ties aren't snapped like this,
Simran... - Akash, I'm pregnant

481
01:17:56,477 --> 01:18:00,002
O Merciful Lord...

482
01:18:00,345 --> 01:18:05,007
everybody would lay down
his life for You

483
01:18:06,049 --> 01:18:10,006
O Savior...

484
01:18:10,051 --> 01:18:12,984
my life's for You

485
01:18:13,052 --> 01:18:18,317
My life, I could give
away for my love...

486
01:18:18,389 --> 01:18:22,483
I'd wipe myself out for my love

487
01:18:22,557 --> 01:18:29,983
I'd finish my identity for my love

488
01:18:30,062 --> 01:18:34,019
O Merciful Lord...

489
01:18:34,097 --> 01:18:38,964
everybody would lay down
his life for You

490
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:43,264
O Savior...

491
01:18:43,369 --> 01:18:48,929
my life's for You

492
01:19:50,305 --> 01:19:52,966
I thought I hated you

493
01:19:55,041 --> 01:19:57,133
I used to dream that you'd
walk before me...

494
01:19:57,209 --> 01:19:58,971
and that I'd shoot you

495
01:20:01,044 --> 01:20:04,979
And now that you stand in
front of me, I hate myself

496
01:20:07,048 --> 01:20:08,981
What goddamned business are we into?

497
01:20:10,383 --> 01:20:13,476
We got to shoot our
kids ourselves...

498
01:20:13,552 --> 01:20:16,349
and then carry their biers
on our own shoulders

499
01:20:18,221 --> 01:20:19,346
Allah!

500
01:20:22,056 --> 01:20:24,523
Looks like that's the punishment
I will get for my misdeeds

501
01:20:28,059 --> 01:20:29,390
What has happened is in the past

502
01:20:32,061 --> 01:20:33,460
I will never stand in your way again

503
01:20:37,598 --> 01:20:40,259
I'm taking Simran and returning
to India for good

504
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,262
Please let me go

505
01:20:53,006 --> 01:20:54,973
How I wish I could...

506
01:20:56,475 --> 01:20:58,170
but it can't be helped, my son

507
01:21:00,277 --> 01:21:03,938
If I don't kill you and set an
example, people will call me impotent

508
01:21:05,446 --> 01:21:06,936
Every boy in my gang
will turn a Romeo...

509
01:21:07,014 --> 01:21:10,413
and will rebel for the sake
of some whore or the other

510
01:21:12,550 --> 01:21:14,949
I have to pull a full-stop
to it, right?

511
01:21:16,018 --> 01:21:17,076
Don't worry, son

512
01:21:18,487 --> 01:21:20,477
I'll kill you and set a good example

513
01:21:21,322 --> 01:21:23,983
After you're dead, I'll
keep your whore alive...

514
01:21:24,057 --> 01:21:27,991
I'll hold on her display on
the terrace, stark naked...

515
01:21:28,025 --> 01:21:29,992
so that people can see...

516
01:21:30,026 --> 01:21:32,425
what consequences befall those that
come between father and son

517
01:21:32,495 --> 01:21:37,430
You get that, son? My boys will
toy with her body every day...

518
01:21:37,498 --> 01:21:40,488
so that she can realise what...

519
01:21:43,367 --> 01:21:44,890
I've given up...

520
01:22:06,514 --> 01:22:09,913
Without You, there isn't a moment

521
01:22:09,982 --> 01:22:13,438
Without You, there is no tomorrow

522
01:22:13,984 --> 01:22:17,510
If it wasn't for You, man
would be stone-hearted

523
01:22:17,986 --> 01:22:21,182
He would know no feeling

524
01:22:21,255 --> 01:22:25,121
For my love, my sweetheart...

525
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:35,959
I'd die, finish myself

526
01:22:35,996 --> 01:22:38,862
I swear, I'd wipe out my identity

527
01:22:38,931 --> 01:22:41,989
O Merciful Lord...

528
01:22:42,065 --> 01:22:47,262
everybody would lay
down his life for You

529
01:22:47,335 --> 01:22:51,133
O Savior...

530
01:22:51,204 --> 01:22:56,868
my life's for You

531
01:23:57,173 --> 01:23:58,834
Simran, I don't want
to lose this baby

532
01:24:02,343 --> 01:24:03,832
I want to marry you, Simran

533
01:24:06,946 --> 01:24:09,413
I want to take you and my baby home

534
01:24:12,482 --> 01:24:16,076
That's what you too want, isn't
it? Isn't that what you want?

535
01:24:19,919 --> 01:24:22,443
I'll give you so much of love,
you'll never crave love again

536
01:24:24,355 --> 01:24:26,322
All I'm afraid of is...

537
01:24:27,190 --> 01:24:28,850
will Daya be able to forget you?

538
01:24:30,925 --> 01:24:33,188
Not even an ordinary man can
accept defeat in love...

539
01:24:33,260 --> 01:24:34,851
...and Daya's a gangster

540
01:24:36,195 --> 01:24:39,287
I don't want a gangster's shadow
to be cast on our child

541
01:24:44,333 --> 01:24:48,324
The family and surroundings
I'm taking you to...

542
01:24:48,368 --> 01:24:51,063
is a place where only
decent folks live

543
01:24:52,303 --> 01:24:55,362
My parents haven't even
sworn at anyone

544
01:24:57,139 --> 01:25:00,301
If they get to know that
you and a gangster were...

545
01:25:01,876 --> 01:25:06,140
Simran, you will have to shut
the doors on the past forever

546
01:25:07,879 --> 01:25:09,346
You'll have to help me

547
01:25:13,349 --> 01:25:19,444
If you want us and our
child to be happy...

548
01:25:24,255 --> 01:25:28,155
you'll have to turn Daya over
to the police, Simran

549
01:25:30,424 --> 01:25:32,823
Hear me out...
- No, Akash...

550
01:25:32,893 --> 01:25:35,952
I'm asking you to save him,
not to trap him

551
01:25:36,028 --> 01:25:38,291
Out in the open, he might fall
a victim to the bullets

552
01:25:38,363 --> 01:25:40,761
Behind the bars, he has a fair
chance of getting justice

553
01:25:40,830 --> 01:25:42,297
Think it over, Simran!

554
01:25:45,399 --> 01:25:46,923
I can't do it, Akash!

555
01:25:56,805 --> 01:25:57,829
Think again, Simran

556
01:26:00,841 --> 01:26:02,774
On one hand are the lives
of the three of us...

557
01:26:03,843 --> 01:26:05,776
on the other is Daya

558
01:26:08,913 --> 01:26:10,106
You're the one who has to decide

559
01:26:28,857 --> 01:26:30,016
Hello...
- Simran!

560
01:26:30,057 --> 01:26:33,048
The police are after us! Get
out of there immediately!

561
01:26:33,126 --> 01:26:34,922
Meet me at the Seoul station at 10

562
01:26:35,793 --> 01:26:36,851
Daya...?

563
01:28:01,741 --> 01:28:02,798
Simran!

564
01:32:22,649 --> 01:32:23,707
C'mon!

565
01:32:23,784 --> 01:32:25,341
Haul him over!

566
01:33:46,061 --> 01:33:48,551
Tantra.
- Is Akash there?

567
01:33:48,630 --> 01:33:51,223
Akash is not here. Who's this?
- This is Simran here...

568
01:33:51,298 --> 01:33:55,027
I've been looking for him... - Simran,
Akash waited all night for you

569
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:58,899
Mr. Raghavan and his men were here
this morning; he has left with them

570
01:33:58,969 --> 01:34:01,232
You'll probably find him at
the Indian embassy, my child

571
01:34:01,637 --> 01:34:04,764
Hello... is everything okay?

572
01:34:50,864 --> 01:34:53,525
I've committed the crime of falling
in love with a gangster

573
01:34:53,599 --> 01:34:55,998
I've committed the crime
of living with him

574
01:34:58,535 --> 01:34:59,592
Daya

575
01:35:00,870 --> 01:35:04,929
Well? The mere mention of his name
makes you break into a cold sweat?

576
01:35:06,139 --> 01:35:08,663
I've spent 5 whole years with him

577
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:21,979
I don't care if I'm caught, Akash

578
01:35:23,882 --> 01:35:28,544
But I know, if I'm caught...

579
01:35:28,618 --> 01:35:30,812
perhaps he will be caught too

580
01:35:32,620 --> 01:35:36,146
It's not today, I've always
tried to protect Daya

581
01:35:37,623 --> 01:35:41,955
Even on the day he got
straight to my house...

582
01:35:42,025 --> 01:35:46,517
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's a saying...

583
01:35:47,595 --> 01:35:50,722
"everything is fair
in love and war"

584
01:35:52,130 --> 01:35:54,529
And this is also a war

585
01:35:55,833 --> 01:35:59,892
For my country. A war against
organised crime

586
01:36:13,842 --> 01:36:17,504
If you have any questions,
you can ask them right now

587
01:36:17,578 --> 01:36:21,068
Mr. Akash, when did you
begin this battle?

588
01:36:21,146 --> 01:36:25,547
In Spring, to catch a cobra, you
got get hold of his female first

589
01:36:25,582 --> 01:36:29,039
That's the mating season they
cannot do without each other

590
01:36:29,150 --> 01:36:32,050
And the cobra is forced
to slither out of its pit

591
01:36:35,121 --> 01:36:36,917
I did something similar

592
01:36:36,989 --> 01:36:40,048
To ferret Daya out of his pit...

593
01:36:42,524 --> 01:36:44,458
I used this beautiful female cobra

594
01:36:45,793 --> 01:36:48,454
She was Daya's weakness
and I became her weakness

595
01:36:48,962 --> 01:36:51,986
Daya was crazy about her and I
drove her crazy about myself

596
01:36:54,999 --> 01:36:57,489
Her dream was to have a small
family of her own...

597
01:36:57,567 --> 01:37:00,693
and my dream was to finish
international organised crime

598
01:37:01,636 --> 01:37:06,469
I put the two dreams together and
the results are there for you to see

599
01:37:06,538 --> 01:37:07,936
How dare you!

600
01:37:08,006 --> 01:37:11,462
How dare you do such a thing?
How dare you...?

601
01:37:12,541 --> 01:37:17,805
How dare you!

602
01:37:23,814 --> 01:37:27,839
Have you never loved me?
Not even for a moment?

603
01:37:27,917 --> 01:37:30,180
Not when you were consoling me,

604
01:37:30,251 --> 01:37:31,512
...getting out bits of
information from me...

605
01:37:31,551 --> 01:37:36,509
in my arms, in bed... wasn't there
a moment when you really loved me?

606
01:37:36,554 --> 01:37:37,918
Never?

607
01:37:39,490 --> 01:37:41,013
No, never

608
01:37:42,024 --> 01:37:45,424
I was only doing my job, my duty

609
01:37:45,493 --> 01:37:47,426
In any case, how would a
police officer like me...

610
01:37:47,494 --> 01:37:50,825
ever fall in love with a cheap
and filthy girl like you?

611
01:37:52,030 --> 01:37:56,431
A girl who has warmed the
bed of a criminal like Daya

612
01:37:59,967 --> 01:38:04,129
It's part of our job to thrust
our hands in filth now and then

613
01:38:06,504 --> 01:38:09,063
But yes, the times when I looked
deep into your eyes...

614
01:38:09,105 --> 01:38:13,836
talked sweetly with you, in
your arms, in your bed...

615
01:38:13,908 --> 01:38:16,705
every moment that I spent with
you, I hated you so much!

616
01:38:16,777 --> 01:38:18,437
Akash...
- Shut up!

617
01:38:19,778 --> 01:38:22,837
I wasn't getting close to you; I
was making a sacrifice for my nation

618
01:38:24,047 --> 01:38:28,709
I was saving those several men who
could've been Daya's victims

619
01:38:28,783 --> 01:38:31,444
I was trying to prevent innocent
children from being orphaned...

620
01:38:31,518 --> 01:38:34,680
by gangsters like Daya!
- Gangster?

621
01:38:34,753 --> 01:38:37,948
He's not a gangster! You guys are!
- Get away!

622
01:38:37,988 --> 01:38:41,649
You cheat despite being in uniforms!
And he never betrayed anyone!

623
01:38:41,723 --> 01:38:44,520
Not in the name of justice,
not in the name of hatred!

624
01:38:44,591 --> 01:38:47,388
If he's caught today, it's only
because of his integrity!

625
01:38:47,460 --> 01:38:49,518
He's not the criminal! You guys are!

626
01:38:49,594 --> 01:38:53,392
In trying to save families,
you've ruined my home today!

627
01:38:53,463 --> 01:38:56,397
In the name of innocent children,
you've killed the baby...

628
01:38:56,465 --> 01:38:57,726
that I'm carrying in my womb!

629
01:38:58,733 --> 01:39:01,666
How could you forget that
this is your baby...?

630
01:39:02,902 --> 01:39:05,835
Akash! How could you forget
that I'm carrying your baby?

631
01:39:05,903 --> 01:39:08,427
You will have to pay for this!

632
01:39:08,504 --> 01:39:09,562
Let's go

633
01:40:49,426 --> 01:40:50,484
Kill me

634
01:40:54,029 --> 01:40:55,724
Please kill me

635
01:40:57,431 --> 01:40:58,454
Kill me...

636
01:41:29,481 --> 01:41:31,948
"You're not to blame for
what you've done, Simran"

637
01:41:33,750 --> 01:41:36,741
"You haven't betrayed me. In fact,

638
01:41:36,819 --> 01:41:38,479
...you are the one who
has been betrayed"

639
01:41:40,421 --> 01:41:41,479
"As for me..."

640
01:41:43,856 --> 01:41:47,346
"I had to face death for shedding
the blood of so many people"

641
01:41:48,692 --> 01:41:50,625
"What could be better for me..."

642
01:41:51,427 --> 01:41:54,395
"that God has made you the
reason of my death?"

643
01:41:55,530 --> 01:41:56,791
"I understand today..."

644
01:41:57,731 --> 01:42:00,823
"why I got to your place of all
the places in that locality"

645
01:42:02,900 --> 01:42:06,357
"I understand today what role
you had to play in my life"

646
01:42:08,703 --> 01:42:10,636
"I've always been a bad man"

647
01:42:11,538 --> 01:42:14,370
"But thanks to you, I'm
dying a gentleman"

648
01:42:16,541 --> 01:42:18,599
"God gave me just one death..."

649
01:42:18,875 --> 01:42:23,367
"but I've lived several lifetimes
in the days I have spent with you"

650
01:42:26,913 --> 01:42:28,403
"One last thing"

651
01:42:29,915 --> 01:42:32,405
"I'm sending your passport
with Usman"

652
01:42:33,917 --> 01:42:36,441
"lt'll take you safely
to my village"

653
01:42:37,919 --> 01:42:39,318
"Don't refuse, Simi"

654
01:42:41,488 --> 01:42:45,388
"If you get there, I'll feel
I've gotten back there"

655
01:42:53,828 --> 01:42:55,454
Daya in police custody

656
01:42:55,528 --> 01:42:57,722
After a long and grim battle...

657
01:42:57,796 --> 01:43:00,696
the law has finally caught up
with gangster Daya Shankar...

658
01:43:00,765 --> 01:43:02,698
who had escaped from India

659
01:43:02,766 --> 01:43:05,495
The credit for the success
goes to Akash

660
01:43:05,568 --> 01:43:08,365
He's the toast of the officers in
the echelons of the police force

661
01:43:23,678 --> 01:43:25,872
Daya created a sensation
in the court today

662
01:43:25,946 --> 01:43:28,344
He prayed to the court
for a death sentence

663
01:43:30,948 --> 01:43:37,373
All charges against Daya Shankar
have been proved in this court

664
01:43:37,451 --> 01:43:42,318
Moreover, the accused has also
confessed to his crimes

665
01:43:42,354 --> 01:43:45,618
This court therefore holds
the accused guilty...

666
01:43:45,690 --> 01:43:47,554
and sentences him to death

667
01:43:47,624 --> 01:43:52,684
He may be hanged till death
on the morning of May 2

668
01:43:52,759 --> 01:43:54,693
To be hanged till death

669
01:44:04,833 --> 01:44:08,323
Nobody knows...

670
01:44:09,669 --> 01:44:14,831
what life I lead...

671
01:44:14,938 --> 01:44:19,430
my life

672
01:44:20,809 --> 01:44:27,644
My story... incomplete

673
01:44:29,380 --> 01:44:37,306
Nobody knows...

674
01:44:39,352 --> 01:44:44,287
nobody has a clue...

675
01:44:44,355 --> 01:44:46,720
what my story is

676
01:44:48,323 --> 01:44:52,655
Daya... forgive me.
Please forgive me

677
01:45:13,804 --> 01:45:20,434
My incomplete story

678
01:45:36,349 --> 01:45:42,217
My incomplete story

679
01:46:10,302 --> 01:46:11,632
Give me your word, Usman...

680
01:46:12,836 --> 01:46:16,702
if I'm caught, you will kill
me at sunset tomorrow

681
01:46:17,306 --> 01:46:18,465
Promise me

682
01:46:19,774 --> 01:46:22,401
Promise me... give
me your word, Usman

683
01:47:03,431 --> 01:47:04,590
Who is it, Sharda?

684
01:48:58,460 --> 01:49:02,121
Stop me not...

685
01:49:02,195 --> 01:49:11,361
let me go to my lover's house

686
01:49:12,302 --> 01:49:16,396
I'm a firefly...

687
01:49:16,470 --> 01:49:26,534
let me die for my flame

688
01:49:27,209 --> 01:49:31,541
Do not stop me

689
01:49:32,211 --> 01:49:36,146
To have him...

690
01:49:36,214 --> 01:49:46,175
is the only aim of my life

691
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:52,154
Should I have him...

692
01:49:52,222 --> 01:50:02,423
let me go forth and embrace death

693
01:50:02,495 --> 01:50:06,623
Should I have him...

694
01:50:07,231 --> 01:50:17,329
let me go forth and embrace death

695
01:50:17,403 --> 01:50:22,202
Do not stop me.
