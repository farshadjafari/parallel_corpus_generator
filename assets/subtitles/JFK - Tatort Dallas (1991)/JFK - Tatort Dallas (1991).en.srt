00:01:00,298 --> 00:01:01,777
<i>January, 1961.</i>

2
00:01:02,417 --> 00:01:06,206
<i>President Dwight D. Eisenhower's</i>
<i>Farewell Address to the Nation.</i>

3
00:01:06,417 --> 00:01:11,048
This conjunction of an immense military
establishment and arms industry is new...

4
00:01:11,658 --> 00:01:13,569
...in the American experience.

5
00:01:13,737 --> 00:01:15,295
The total influence...

6
00:01:15,378 --> 00:01:17,938
...economic, political, even spiritual...

7
00:01:18,737 --> 00:01:22,890
...is felt in every city, every Statehouse,
every government office.

8
00:01:23,658 --> 00:01:25,966
We must guard against the acquisition...

9
00:01:26,058 --> 00:01:29,686
...of unwarranted influence,
whether sought or unsought...

10
00:01:29,897 --> 00:01:32,537
...by the military-industrial complex.

11
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:35,406
We must never let the weight
of this combination...

12
00:01:35,498 --> 00:01:38,251
...endanger our liberties
or democratic processes.

13
00:01:39,897 --> 00:01:41,126
<i>November, 1960.</i>

14
00:01:41,617 --> 00:01:44,609
<i>Senator John Fitzgerald Kennedy</i>
<i>of Massachusetts...</i>

15
00:01:44,778 --> 00:01:48,087
<i>...wins one of the narrowest election</i>
<i>victories in American history...</i>

16
00:01:48,177 --> 00:01:52,534
<i>...over Vice President Richard Nixon</i>
<i>by a little more than 100,000 votes.</i>

17
00:01:52,977 --> 00:01:56,766
<i>Alongside his beautiful and elegant wife,</i>
<i>Jacqueline Bouvier...</i>

18
00:01:56,938 --> 00:02:00,453
<i>...Kennedy is the symbol</i>
<i>of the new freedom of the 1960s...</i>

19
00:02:00,617 --> 00:02:03,769
<i>...signifying change and upheaval</i>
<i>to the American public.</i>

20
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:05,688
"All men are created equal."

21
00:02:05,778 --> 00:02:09,168
Every degree of mind and spirit
that I possess will be devoted...

22
00:02:09,257 --> 00:02:11,135
...to the cause of freedom
around the world.

23
00:02:11,218 --> 00:02:13,412
Today, the proudest boast is:

24
00:02:13,737 --> 00:02:15,534
<i>"Ich bin ein Berliner!"</i>

25
00:02:16,498 --> 00:02:21,127
<i>He inherits a secret war against the</i>
<i>Communist Castro dictatorship in Cuba...</i>

26
00:02:21,298 --> 00:02:24,335
<i>...a war run by the CIA</i>
<i>and angry Cuban exiles.</i>

27
00:02:24,818 --> 00:02:27,127
<i>Castro is a successful revolutionary...</i>

28
00:02:27,217 --> 00:02:30,493
<i>...frightening to American business</i>
<i>interests in Latin America.</i>

29
00:02:30,578 --> 00:02:33,888
<i>This war culminates in the disastrous</i>
<i>Bay of Pigs invasion...</i>

30
00:02:34,057 --> 00:02:35,810
<i>...in April, 1961...</i>

31
00:02:36,298 --> 00:02:40,610
<i>...when Kennedy refuses to provide</i>
<i>air cover for the exiled Cuban brigade.</i>

32
00:02:40,777 --> 00:02:43,974
<i>Kennedy takes public responsibility</i>
<i>for the failure.</i>

33
00:02:44,177 --> 00:02:46,931
<i>He privately claims the CIA lied to him...</i>

34
00:02:47,018 --> 00:02:51,250
<i>...and tried to manipulate him into ordering</i>
<i>an American invasion of Cuba.</i>

35
00:02:52,937 --> 00:02:54,656
<i>In October, 1962...</i>

36
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:57,856
<i>...the world comes to the brink</i>
<i>of nuclear war...</i>

37
00:02:57,937 --> 00:02:59,769
<i>...when Kennedy quarantines Cuba...</i>

38
00:02:59,858 --> 00:03:03,817
<i>...after announcing the presence</i>
<i>of offensive Soviet nuclear missiles...</i>

39
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:06,008
<i>...90 miles off American shores.</i>

40
00:03:06,098 --> 00:03:09,134
<i>Soviet ships with more missiles</i>
<i>sail towards Cuba...</i>

41
00:03:09,418 --> 00:03:11,612
<i>...but at the last moment they turn back.</i>

42
00:03:11,698 --> 00:03:13,893
<i>The world breathes with relief.</i>

43
00:03:14,098 --> 00:03:17,931
<i>In Washington, rumors abound</i>
<i>that JFK has cut a secret deal...</i>

44
00:03:18,258 --> 00:03:20,055
<i>...with Russian Premier Khrushchev...</i>

45
00:03:20,138 --> 00:03:24,370
<i>...not to invade Cuba in return</i>
<i>for a Russian withdrawal of missiles.</i>

46
00:03:24,818 --> 00:03:28,127
<i>Suspicions abound that Kennedy</i>
<i>is soft on communism.</i>

47
00:03:29,298 --> 00:03:32,893
<i>Kennedy also finds himself embroiled</i>
<i>in Laos and Vietnam.</i>

48
00:03:33,258 --> 00:03:35,328
We've got our difficulties there.

49
00:03:35,538 --> 00:03:38,449
Unless a greater effort is made
by the government...

50
00:03:38,538 --> 00:03:42,133
...to win popular support,
I don't think the war can be won there.

51
00:03:42,217 --> 00:03:45,893
It's their war. They're the ones
who have to win it or lose it.

52
00:03:46,057 --> 00:03:47,570
<i>Early that fateful summer...</i>

53
00:03:47,657 --> 00:03:51,048
<i>...Kennedy speaks of his new vision</i>
<i>at the American University.</i>

54
00:03:51,217 --> 00:03:52,730
What kind of peace do I mean?

55
00:03:52,818 --> 00:03:54,729
What kind of peace do we seek?

56
00:03:54,858 --> 00:03:56,415
Not a <i>Pax Americana</i>...

57
00:03:56,777 --> 00:04:00,087
...enforced on the world
by American weapons of war.

58
00:04:00,497 --> 00:04:04,173
We must re-examine our own attitudes
towards the Soviet Union.

59
00:04:04,657 --> 00:04:06,728
Our most basic, common link...

60
00:04:07,018 --> 00:04:08,973
...is that we all inhabit...

61
00:04:09,258 --> 00:04:10,770
...this small planet.

62
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:12,814
We all breathe the same air.

63
00:04:13,138 --> 00:04:15,492
We all cherish our children's futures.

64
00:04:15,818 --> 00:04:17,649
And we are all mortal.

65
00:04:27,538 --> 00:04:29,255
You fucking assholes!

66
00:04:32,377 --> 00:04:33,857
<i>Don't leave me here!</i>

67
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,096
They've gone to Dallas.

68
00:04:38,697 --> 00:04:39,653
<i>Friday.</i>

69
00:04:42,218 --> 00:04:44,173
They're going to kill...

70
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,891
<i>...Kennedy.</i>

71
00:04:47,658 --> 00:04:49,137
<i>Call somebody.</i>

72
00:04:50,377 --> 00:04:51,492
Stop them.

73
00:04:55,057 --> 00:04:57,333
These are serious fucking guys.

74
00:05:03,338 --> 00:05:06,535
She's been high on something
since they brought her in.

75
00:05:06,737 --> 00:05:07,853
Help!

76
00:05:08,497 --> 00:05:09,487
Please!

77
00:06:59,338 --> 00:07:01,726
<i>Here is a bulletin from CBS News.</i>

78
00:07:02,697 --> 00:07:05,165
<i>In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired...</i>

79
00:07:05,298 --> 00:07:08,209
<i>...at President Kennedy's motorcade</i>
<i>in downtown Dallas.</i>

80
00:07:08,298 --> 00:07:10,687
<i>The first reports say</i>
<i>that President Kennedy...</i>

81
00:07:10,778 --> 00:07:13,372
<i>...has been seriously wounded</i>
<i>by the shooting.</i>

82
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:36,817
What's wrong?

83
00:07:38,538 --> 00:07:40,255
The President's been shot.

84
00:07:40,658 --> 00:07:42,569
In Dallas. Five minutes ago.

85
00:07:43,017 --> 00:07:44,211
Oh, no!

86
00:07:46,898 --> 00:07:48,125
How bad?

87
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,891
No word. They think it's in the head.

88
00:07:59,177 --> 00:08:00,815
Napoleon's has a TV set.

89
00:08:01,737 --> 00:08:06,050
<i>Three bullets were found. Gov. Connally</i>
<i>also appeared to have been hit.</i>

90
00:08:06,538 --> 00:08:10,850
<i>The President was rushed to Parkland</i>
<i>Memorial Hospital, four miles away.</i>

91
00:08:11,377 --> 00:08:15,290
<i>We are told the bullet entered the base</i>
<i>of the throat and came out the back...</i>

92
00:08:15,377 --> 00:08:17,572
<i>...but there is no confirmation.</i>

93
00:08:17,778 --> 00:08:21,896
<i>Blood transfusions are being given.</i>
<i>A priest has administered the last rites.</i>

94
00:08:24,617 --> 00:08:26,255
There's still a chance.

95
00:08:28,017 --> 00:08:29,211
Pull through, Jack.

96
00:08:29,298 --> 00:08:30,492
<i>From Dallas...</i>

97
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:32,648
<i>...the flash, apparently official:</i>

<i>President Kennedy died...</i>

99

<i>...2:00 Eastern Standard Time...</i>

<i>...some 38 minutes ago.</i>

102
00:08:48,337 --> 00:08:50,851
<i>Vice President Johnson</i>
<i>has left the hospital.</i>

103
00:08:51,337 --> 00:08:54,693
<i>Presumably he will take</i>
<i>the oath of office shortly...</i>

104
00:08:55,057 --> 00:08:58,494
<i>...and become the 36th President</i>
<i>of the United States.</i>

105
00:08:59,817 --> 00:09:03,447
<i>He did so much for this country,</i>
<i>for colored people. Why?</i>

106
00:09:08,138 --> 00:09:10,572
Good-bye, you sorry bastard! Die!

107
00:09:11,337 --> 00:09:12,975
Shut the fuck up!

108
00:09:14,217 --> 00:09:16,731
I'm ashamed to be an American today.

109
00:09:17,097 --> 00:09:19,975
<i>The President of the United States is dead.</i>

110
00:09:20,937 --> 00:09:25,375
<i>I just talked to Father Oscar Hubert</i>
<i>of the Holy Trinity Catholic Church.</i>

111
00:09:26,057 --> 00:09:27,490
<i>He told me...</i>

112
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:31,094
<i>...President Kennedy has been given</i>
<i>the last rites.</i>

113
00:09:31,658 --> 00:09:33,489
<i>Shortly after 12:30...</i>

114
00:09:34,217 --> 00:09:36,856
<i>...near the park in downtown Dallas...</i>

115
00:09:37,817 --> 00:09:39,375
<i>...the shots rang out.</i>

116
00:09:39,977 --> 00:09:41,808
<i>The President is dead.</i>

117
00:09:43,697 --> 00:09:45,813
The bullets came up over our heads...

118
00:09:45,898 --> 00:09:48,365
...from that fence up on the knoll.

119
00:09:48,778 --> 00:09:50,927
I seen his face when it hit.

120
00:09:52,337 --> 00:09:55,171
His ear blew off and he turned real white.

121
00:09:58,857 --> 00:10:01,133
<i>He flopped over on his stomach...</i>

122
00:10:03,658 --> 00:10:05,568
<i>...with his foot sticking out.</i>

123
00:10:08,018 --> 00:10:11,692
<i>None of us thought it could happen</i>
<i>in America or any place else.</i>

124
00:10:12,018 --> 00:10:15,168
All this blubbering over
that no-count son of a bitch!

125
00:10:15,337 --> 00:10:18,693
They're bawling like they knew the man.
Makes me want to puke.

126
00:10:19,857 --> 00:10:22,246
For God's sake, the President was shot.

127
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,129
A bullshit President!

128
00:10:24,337 --> 00:10:27,216
Nobody's crying for the thousands
of Cubans...

129
00:10:28,018 --> 00:10:31,408
...that bastard condemned to death
and torture at Bay of Pigs.

130
00:10:32,457 --> 00:10:34,369
Goddamn peace treaties!

131
00:10:34,977 --> 00:10:36,889
<i>I heard shots from over there.</i>

132
00:10:37,778 --> 00:10:40,576
-<i>I heard shots from over there.</i>
-<i>How many?</i>

133
00:10:41,097 --> 00:10:43,895
That's what happens
when you let the niggers vote.

134
00:10:44,658 --> 00:10:47,535
They get together with the Jews
and the Catholics...

135
00:10:48,138 --> 00:10:50,368
...and elect an Irish bleeding heart.

136
00:10:50,577 --> 00:10:52,932
Chief, maybe you had too much to drink.

137
00:10:53,258 --> 00:10:54,532
Bullshit!

138
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:56,807
Here's to the New Frontier.

139
00:10:57,738 --> 00:10:59,649
Camelot in smithereens.

140
00:11:00,937 --> 00:11:02,576
I'll drink to that.

141
00:11:07,378 --> 00:11:09,892
<i>Dallas police have just announced...</i>

142
00:11:10,258 --> 00:11:14,375
<i>...they have a suspect in the killing</i>
<i>of Dallas policeman J.D. Tippet...</i>

143
00:11:14,538 --> 00:11:17,974
<i>...who was shot at 1:15 in Oak Cliff,</i>
<i>a Dallas suburb.</i>

144
00:11:19,018 --> 00:11:22,806
<i>Police say there could be a tie</i>-<i>in</i>
<i>to the President's murder.</i>

145
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:26,208
<i>The suspect, identified</i>
<i>as a Lee Harvey Oswald...</i>

146
00:11:26,857 --> 00:11:29,496
<i>...was arrested by more</i>
<i>than a dozen policemen...</i>

147
00:11:29,577 --> 00:11:33,126
<i>...after a short scuffle at a movie theater</i>
<i>in Oak Cliff.</i>

148
00:11:34,418 --> 00:11:36,249
<i>Officer Tippet was killed...</i>

149
00:11:37,298 --> 00:11:39,765
<i>...by a revolver which was found</i>
<i>on Oswald.</i>

150
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:43,250
Shoot the bastard!

151
00:11:43,658 --> 00:11:46,297
Give him a medal for shooting Kennedy!

152
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,653
<i>I don't know what I am charged with...</i>

153
00:11:50,738 --> 00:11:53,206
<i>...but I emphatically deny these charges.</i>

154
00:11:55,337 --> 00:11:57,726
The kid must've gone nuts, right?

155
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,248
I said, Oswald must've flipped.

156
00:12:01,577 --> 00:12:02,567
Right?

157
00:12:03,538 --> 00:12:06,894
Just did this crazy thing
before anybody could stop him.

158
00:12:07,378 --> 00:12:09,937
I'm going. I've got to get home, Chief.

159
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:12,134
What are you talking about?

160
00:12:13,138 --> 00:12:14,809
Who'd have ever thought...

161
00:12:14,898 --> 00:12:18,971
...that goofy Oswald kid would pull
a stunt like an assassination?

162
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:23,451
Goes to show you can never know
about some people. Am I right, Jack?

163
00:12:23,937 --> 00:12:25,370
Am I right, Jack?

164
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:27,529
Well, bless my soul.

165
00:12:28,177 --> 00:12:31,215
All these years, I thought you were
on my team.

166
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:33,610
Are you kidding?

167
00:12:34,418 --> 00:12:36,807
I couldn't be more serious, Jack.

168
00:12:37,378 --> 00:12:40,893
Your little red eyes have me wondering
about your loyalty.

169
00:12:48,817 --> 00:12:50,615
Look at that, Martin.

170
00:12:53,937 --> 00:12:56,008
Who's been going through my files?

171
00:12:56,258 --> 00:12:59,330
You've been looking through my files,
you little weasel!

172
00:13:00,177 --> 00:13:02,975
You're starting to get paranoid. Really!

173
00:13:04,177 --> 00:13:06,089
You went through all my files!

174
00:13:06,498 --> 00:13:07,850
You're a goddamn spy!

175
00:13:07,937 --> 00:13:10,405
Why would I want to look
through your files?

176
00:13:10,658 --> 00:13:13,456
I've seen enough here this summer
to write a book.

177
00:13:13,618 --> 00:13:15,528
I always lock my files!

178
00:13:15,937 --> 00:13:17,849
You're the only one here today.

179
00:13:18,418 --> 00:13:20,648
What do you mean, you bastard?

180
00:13:21,298 --> 00:13:23,493
You're going to write a book?

181
00:13:23,778 --> 00:13:25,529
You know what I mean.

182
00:13:25,778 --> 00:13:28,451
I've seen a lot of strange things here.

183
00:13:29,457 --> 00:13:30,890
Strange people.

184
00:13:39,138 --> 00:13:41,413
You didn't see a goddamn thing!

185
00:13:41,778 --> 00:13:43,256
Not a goddamn thing!

186
00:13:43,457 --> 00:13:45,926
<i>The full name is Lee Harvey Oswald.</i>

187
00:13:47,298 --> 00:13:50,734
-<i>Did you shoot the President?</i>
-<i>I didn't shoot anybody.</i>

188
00:13:51,057 --> 00:13:54,971
<i>They have taken me in</i>
<i>because I have lived in the Soviet Union.</i>

189
00:13:56,097 --> 00:13:57,735
<i>I'm just a patsy!</i>

190
00:13:58,498 --> 00:14:00,567
He sure looks like a creep.

191
00:14:01,538 --> 00:14:05,371
<i>I protested at that time I was not allowed</i>
<i>legal representation...</i>

192
00:14:06,418 --> 00:14:09,375
<i>...during that very short and sweet hearing.</i>

193
00:14:10,097 --> 00:14:11,610
<i>I really don't know...</i>

194
00:14:11,778 --> 00:14:13,529
<i>...what this situation is about.</i>

195
00:14:13,618 --> 00:14:16,654
<i>Nobody has told me anything</i>
<i>except that I am accused...</i>

196
00:14:16,977 --> 00:14:18,808
<i>...of murdering a policeman.</i>

197
00:14:18,977 --> 00:14:21,207
<i>I know nothing more than that.</i>

198
00:14:21,857 --> 00:14:24,418
<i>I do request someone to come forward...</i>

199
00:14:24,658 --> 00:14:26,727
<i>...to give me legal assistance.</i>

200
00:14:27,378 --> 00:14:30,336
<i>Were you ever in the Free Cuba movement</i>
<i>or whatever it's called?</i>

201
00:14:30,418 --> 00:14:32,692
<i>It's the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.</i>

202
00:14:32,898 --> 00:14:35,206
<i>Why were you in Russia?</i>
<i>What happened to your eye?</i>

203
00:14:35,298 --> 00:14:38,096
He seems pretty cool
for a man under pressure.

204
00:14:38,258 --> 00:14:39,850
<i>A policeman hit me.</i>

205
00:14:40,018 --> 00:14:41,530
He gives me the willies.

206
00:14:41,618 --> 00:14:44,576
Come on, sugarplums,
it's past your bedtimes.

207
00:14:45,298 --> 00:14:47,937
Mattie, honey, get a hold of yourself.

208
00:14:52,097 --> 00:14:53,451
A fine man.

209
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,253
<i>After a stint in the Marines...</i>

210
00:14:57,337 --> 00:15:01,490
<i>...he became fascinated by communism.</i>
<i>He is said to be a dedicated Marxist...</i>

211
00:15:01,857 --> 00:15:06,009
<i>...and a fanatical supporter of Fidel Castro</i>
<i>and ultra left</i>-<i>wing causes.</i>

212
00:15:06,258 --> 00:15:09,056
<i>He spent last summer in New Orleans</i>
<i>and was arrested...</i>

213
00:15:09,138 --> 00:15:12,096
<i>...in a brawl with anti</i>-<i>Castro Cuban exiles.</i>

214
00:15:15,057 --> 00:15:17,652
Lou? Sorry to disturb you this late.

215
00:15:18,337 --> 00:15:22,331
Matter of routine. Get on
this Oswald connection in New Orleans.

216
00:15:22,898 --> 00:15:27,210
Check out his record. Find any friends
or associates from last summer.

217
00:15:27,457 --> 00:15:30,813
Let's meet with the investigators
day after tomorrow.

218
00:15:31,457 --> 00:15:32,652
<i>On Sunday?</i>

219
00:15:32,817 --> 00:15:34,331
Sunday. 11:00.

220
00:15:35,298 --> 00:15:36,572
Thanks, Lou.

221
00:15:36,738 --> 00:15:39,251
<i>I would say that he is the killer...</i>

222
00:15:39,937 --> 00:15:43,134
<i>...beyond a reasonable doubt</i>
<i>and to a moral certainty.</i>

223
00:15:43,457 --> 00:15:47,052
<i>I thought a motorcycle had backfired.</i>
<i>I looked to my left.</i>

224
00:15:47,217 --> 00:15:49,208
<i>A second shot hit him in the face.</i>

225
00:15:49,298 --> 00:15:53,370
<i>The rifle, a cheap World War Il,</i>
<i>Italian</i>-<i>made Mannlicher</i>-<i>Carcano...</i>

226
00:15:54,177 --> 00:15:56,567
<i>...was ordered from</i>
<i>a Chicago mailing house...</i>

227
00:15:56,658 --> 00:15:59,695
<i>...and shipped to Oswald's alias, A. Hidell...</i>

228
00:16:00,097 --> 00:16:02,817
<i>...at a post office box in March of 1963.</i>

229
00:16:02,977 --> 00:16:06,413
<i>This same rifle was used</i>
<i>to assassinate the President.</i>

230
00:16:06,898 --> 00:16:08,490
That ties it up.

231
00:16:08,977 --> 00:16:12,572
Another nut. Jesus Christ,
anybody can get a rifle in Texas!

232
00:16:12,817 --> 00:16:17,208
As far as Oswald's associates,
one name keeps popping up: David Ferrie.

233
00:16:17,538 --> 00:16:20,416
Oswald was seen with him
several times last summer.

234
00:16:20,738 --> 00:16:23,126
I know David. Strange character.

235
00:16:23,937 --> 00:16:27,533
He's been in trouble before. He was
a hot-shot pilot for Eastern Airlines.

236
00:16:27,618 --> 00:16:30,256
Got canned after an alleged
homosexual incident.

237
00:16:30,337 --> 00:16:34,172
<i>These photos were found yesterday</i>
<i>among Oswald's possessions...</i>

238
00:16:34,337 --> 00:16:38,125
<i>...in the garage where Marina Oswald</i>
<i>and her children are living.</i>

239
00:16:38,217 --> 00:16:41,573
Somebody mentioned Ferrie
on that Texas trip. Find that out.

240
00:16:41,977 --> 00:16:43,696
<i>He no shoot anyone.</i>

241
00:16:45,057 --> 00:16:47,014
<i>He good man. Good husband.</i>

242
00:16:47,618 --> 00:16:51,451
So it seems David Ferrie drove off
on Friday afternoon for Texas.

243
00:16:51,697 --> 00:16:55,008
A source said he might have been
a getaway pilot for Oswald.

244
00:16:56,418 --> 00:16:57,850
Hold your horses.

245
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,610
What kind of source?

246
00:16:59,857 --> 00:17:01,849
The anonymous kind, Chief.

247
00:17:02,097 --> 00:17:05,773
I remember Ferrie speaking
at a meeting of some veterans group...

248
00:17:05,937 --> 00:17:08,770
...ranting against Castro. Extreme stuff.

249
00:17:10,337 --> 00:17:13,171
They're bringing him out.
Numa, turn it up.

250
00:17:14,577 --> 00:17:15,851
<i>Here he comes!</i>

251
00:17:21,178 --> 00:17:23,169
<i>Anything to say in your defense?</i>

252
00:17:24,018 --> 00:17:25,211
<i>Oswald!</i>

253
00:17:27,057 --> 00:17:28,457
He shot him!

254
00:17:30,657 --> 00:17:32,010
He shot him on TV!

255
00:17:35,377 --> 00:17:37,049
<i>There's a man with a gun!</i>

256
00:17:38,738 --> 00:17:41,126
Seventy cops there.
What were they doing?

257
00:17:42,817 --> 00:17:46,777
No trial now. Somebody just saved
the Dallas DA a pile of work.

258
00:17:52,897 --> 00:17:55,458
Let's get David Ferrie in here anyway.

259
00:17:55,938 --> 00:17:58,008
It's wrong. This is crazy!

260
00:18:12,018 --> 00:18:16,135
<i>Yesterday, in the midst of sorrow,</i>
<i>the business of government went on.</i>

261
00:18:16,337 --> 00:18:20,615
<i>The President met with Henry Cabot Lodge,</i>
<i>our Ambassador to Vietnam...</i>

262
00:18:20,897 --> 00:18:22,775
<i>...and members of his Cabinet.</i>

263
00:18:22,857 --> 00:18:24,973
<i>The major subject was Vietnam...</i>

264
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:27,810
<i>...a crisis that does not pause</i>
<i>for bereavement.</i>

265
00:18:27,978 --> 00:18:29,411
<i>From this meeting...</i>

266
00:18:29,577 --> 00:18:33,126
<i>...came affirmations that</i>
<i>the US would continue aiding...</i>

267
00:18:33,298 --> 00:18:37,928
<i>...the new government of Vietnam in</i>
<i>its war against the Communist insurgents.</i>

268
00:18:44,337 --> 00:18:45,737
David Ferrie.

269
00:18:47,218 --> 00:18:48,570
Come on in.

270
00:18:49,897 --> 00:18:51,250
Thanks for coming.

271
00:18:51,337 --> 00:18:55,172
Remember me? We met
on Carondelet Street after your election.

272
00:18:55,978 --> 00:18:58,730
I remember.
You make quite an impression.

273
00:18:59,377 --> 00:19:01,971
I've heard you're a first-rate pilot.

274
00:19:02,258 --> 00:19:05,932
Legend has it you can get in
and out of the smallest field.

275
00:19:06,218 --> 00:19:10,733
I'm a pilot myself. Flew grasshoppers
for the field artillery in the war.

276
00:19:11,337 --> 00:19:13,294
Make yourself comfortable.

277
00:19:14,857 --> 00:19:16,290
Mind if I smoke?

278
00:19:16,817 --> 00:19:17,967
How could I?

279
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:22,367
As you know, President Kennedy
was assassinated on Friday.

280
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:26,053
A man named Lee Harvey Oswald
was arrested as a suspect...

281
00:19:26,258 --> 00:19:29,170
...then murdered yesterday
by a man named Jack Ruby.

282
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:32,256
We've had reports that Oswald
spent the summer here...

283
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,374
...and that you knew Oswald.

284
00:19:35,218 --> 00:19:39,415
I've never met anyone named Oswald.
Anyone who told you that has to be crazy.

285
00:19:39,538 --> 00:19:43,372
He served in your Civil Air Patrol unit
when he was a teenager.

286
00:19:43,538 --> 00:19:45,846
If he did, I don't remember him.

287
00:19:46,097 --> 00:19:48,009
Lots of boys in and out.

288
00:19:48,178 --> 00:19:52,250
Surely you've seen this. Perhaps
you knew him under another name?

289
00:19:54,377 --> 00:19:56,607
I never saw him before in my life.

290
00:19:58,057 --> 00:20:00,810
Then we must have gotten
mistaken information.

291
00:20:01,097 --> 00:20:03,167
Thanks for straightening it out.

292
00:20:04,978 --> 00:20:06,969
There's one other matter.

293
00:20:09,577 --> 00:20:13,730
We heard you went to Texas
shortly after the assassination on Friday.

294
00:20:13,897 --> 00:20:15,854
True. I drove to Houston.

295
00:20:16,018 --> 00:20:18,167
What was so appealing about Houston?

296
00:20:18,377 --> 00:20:22,053
I hadn't been ice-skating lately.
Some young friends and I...

297
00:20:22,218 --> 00:20:23,855
...decided to go skating.

298
00:20:24,018 --> 00:20:26,577
Why the urge to ice-skate in Texas...

299
00:20:26,738 --> 00:20:29,934
...during one of the worst thunderstorms
in recent memory?

300
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:34,295
Spur-of-the-moment thing.

301
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,096
Storm wasn't that bad.

302
00:20:37,938 --> 00:20:39,416
Where did you drive?

303
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:40,971
We went to Houston.

304
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:44,211
Saturday we drove to Galveston,
and stayed there.

305
00:20:44,617 --> 00:20:45,971
And Sunday?

306
00:20:46,857 --> 00:20:49,133
In the morning, we went goose hunting.

307
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,731
Did you bag any?

308
00:20:51,657 --> 00:20:53,454
The boys got a couple.

309
00:20:53,617 --> 00:20:55,494
Boys said they didn't get any.

310
00:20:58,698 --> 00:20:59,892
They're right.

311
00:21:00,978 --> 00:21:03,730
There were thousands
of geese everywhere.

312
00:21:04,778 --> 00:21:07,497
But you couldn't approach them.
They're wise.

313
00:21:08,938 --> 00:21:11,498
Your friends said you had no weapons.

314
00:21:12,298 --> 00:21:15,335
Isn't it difficult to hunt geese
without a shotgun?

315
00:21:20,298 --> 00:21:22,253
I remember now. I'm sorry.

316
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,971
I got confused.

317
00:21:24,258 --> 00:21:28,375
We got near the geese, then realized
we had forgotten our shotguns.

318
00:21:29,778 --> 00:21:31,006
Stupid, right?

319
00:21:31,377 --> 00:21:34,050
So, of course, we didn't get any geese.

320
00:21:35,178 --> 00:21:37,134
Thank you for your time.

321
00:21:38,097 --> 00:21:40,327
Sorry this must end inconveniently...

322
00:21:40,498 --> 00:21:43,807
...but I must detain you for questioning
by the FBI.

323
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:45,936
Why? What's wrong?

324
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:47,974
Your story is not believable.

325
00:21:49,298 --> 00:21:50,491
Really?

326
00:21:53,778 --> 00:21:55,051
What part?

327
00:22:14,057 --> 00:22:17,255
This afternoon the FBI released
David W. Ferrie...

328
00:22:17,817 --> 00:22:18,932
...of New Orleans.

329
00:22:19,018 --> 00:22:22,374
After extensive questioning
and a background check...

330
00:22:22,538 --> 00:22:26,974
...the Bureau found no evidence
that Mr. Ferrie knew Lee Harvey Oswald...

331
00:22:27,538 --> 00:22:30,654
<i>...or had any connection</i>
<i>with the assassination.</i>

332
00:22:31,698 --> 00:22:34,690
<i>The agent in charge would like</i>
<i>to make clear...</i>

333
00:22:34,897 --> 00:22:37,332
<i>...that Ferrie was brought in</i>
<i>for questioning...</i>

334
00:22:37,417 --> 00:22:40,136
<i>...by the District Attorney</i>
<i>of Orleans Parish.</i>

335
00:22:41,258 --> 00:22:43,249
I thought we were on the same side.

336
00:22:43,337 --> 00:22:45,089
Why are they saying that?

337
00:22:45,258 --> 00:22:47,692
Pretty fast, the way they let him go.

338
00:22:48,178 --> 00:22:50,373
They must know something we don't.

339
00:22:51,377 --> 00:22:53,607
So let's get on with our lives.

340
00:22:54,258 --> 00:22:56,407
We have many homegrown crimes
to prosecute.

341
00:22:56,498 --> 00:22:58,089
<i>The President has announced...</i>

342
00:22:58,178 --> 00:23:02,011
<i>...the creation of a commission</i>
<i>to probe the events in Dallas.</i>

343
00:23:02,577 --> 00:23:05,729
<i>It will be headed</i>
<i>by Chief Justice Earl Warren...</i>

344
00:23:06,577 --> 00:23:11,015
<i>...and is expected to head off</i>
<i>several Congressional and Texas inquiries.</i>

345
00:23:11,218 --> 00:23:14,210
<i>On the panel are Allen Dulles,</i>
<i>ex</i>-<i>chief of the CIA...</i>

346
00:23:14,377 --> 00:23:17,733
<i>...Representative Gerald Ford,</i>
<i>banker John McCloy....</i>

347
00:23:22,218 --> 00:23:26,496
Fucking out of control. All of these hippies
running around on drugs.

348
00:23:27,178 --> 00:23:29,976
You can't tell a boy from a girl anymore.

349
00:23:31,018 --> 00:23:35,250
I saw a girl the other day. Pregnant.
You could see her whole belly.

350
00:23:35,657 --> 00:23:38,855
You know what she had painted on it?
"Love Child."

351
00:23:44,337 --> 00:23:46,294
It's a mess down there, Jim.

352
00:23:46,538 --> 00:23:49,575
We've bitten off more Vietnam
than we can chew.

353
00:23:50,057 --> 00:23:53,528
It figures with that polecat Lyndon
in the White House.

354
00:23:54,897 --> 00:23:58,810
I sometimes think things have gone
downhill since Kennedy died.

355
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:01,414
Don't get me started on that.

356
00:24:01,577 --> 00:24:05,412
Those Warren Commission fellows
were picking gnat shit out of pepper.

357
00:24:05,617 --> 00:24:09,895
Nobody's going to tell me that kid
shot like he did from that bookstore.

358
00:24:11,978 --> 00:24:15,334
But the FBI test-fired the rifle
to see if it could be done.

359
00:24:15,498 --> 00:24:18,410
Three experts and not one
of them could do it.

360
00:24:18,577 --> 00:24:22,695
They say that Oswald got off three shots
with world-class precision...

361
00:24:22,897 --> 00:24:26,573
...from a manual bolt-action rifle
in less than six seconds.

362
00:24:26,738 --> 00:24:30,094
According to his Marine buddies,
he got Maggie's drawers.

363
00:24:30,258 --> 00:24:32,488
That means he wasn't any good.

364
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:35,531
<i>Average man would be lucky</i>
<i>to shoot twice.</i>

365
00:24:35,698 --> 00:24:38,007
<i>And the first would be the best.</i>

366
00:24:38,258 --> 00:24:40,452
<i>Here the third shot's perfect.</i>

367
00:24:40,617 --> 00:24:43,451
And they got that bullet zigzagging
all over the place...

368
00:24:43,538 --> 00:24:46,051
<i>...hitting Kennedy and Connally</i>
<i>seven times.</i>

369
00:24:46,897 --> 00:24:49,730
One pristine bullet? That dog don't hunt.

370
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:55,694
Something's always bothered me
about that from day one.

371
00:24:56,938 --> 00:24:59,167
Think other men were involved?

372
00:25:00,137 --> 00:25:04,653
If I was investigating the case, I'd round up
100 of the world's best riflemen...

373
00:25:04,938 --> 00:25:07,611
...and find out which ones were
in Dallas that day.

374
00:25:07,698 --> 00:25:11,054
You been duck hunting.
Oswald's an old-fashioned decoy.

375
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:14,368
What did he say? "I'm just a patsy!"
Believe it.

376
00:25:25,617 --> 00:25:27,653
Dinner's just about ready.

377
00:25:29,298 --> 00:25:32,607
Got a surprise for you tonight.
Tried something new.

378
00:25:38,897 --> 00:25:40,376
-What?
-Dinner.

379
00:25:41,738 --> 00:25:44,012
Smells good. Do you know Oswald...

380
00:25:44,178 --> 00:25:47,375
...was interrogated for 12 hours
after the assassination...

381
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:51,211
...with no lawyer present,
and nobody recorded a word of it.

382
00:25:52,498 --> 00:25:56,286
I can't believe it. An experienced
police captain and a crowd of FBI agents...

383
00:25:56,377 --> 00:26:00,576
...had to know that with no record,
what Oswald said is inadmissible in court.

384
00:26:01,137 --> 00:26:03,698
Let's talk at the table. It's getting cold.

385
00:26:03,817 --> 00:26:05,729
What are you doing here?

386
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:08,013
Daddy said it's okay if I'm quiet.

387
00:26:08,617 --> 00:26:09,686
Sure it is.

388
00:26:09,778 --> 00:26:12,849
If I handled a minor felon that way,
it'd be all over the papers.

389
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:15,531
This is the alleged murderer
of the President.

390
00:26:21,258 --> 00:26:24,215
Again and again
credible testimony's ignored.

391
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:28,730
Leads are not followed up,
conclusions are selective, no index.

392
00:26:29,738 --> 00:26:32,855
It's the sloppiest investigation
I've ever seen.

393
00:26:33,897 --> 00:26:36,537
Dozens of witnesses heard the shots...

394
00:26:37,337 --> 00:26:40,057
...coming from the grassy knoll
in front of Kennedy...

395
00:26:40,137 --> 00:26:42,527
...not the Book Depository behind him.

396
00:26:42,738 --> 00:26:47,288
But it's broken down and spread around.
You read it, but the point is lost.

397
00:26:47,538 --> 00:26:49,289
I never believed it.

398
00:26:49,617 --> 00:26:52,132
I'll do the dishes. You take Eb up.

399
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:55,607
Elizabeth, your bedtime too!

400
00:26:56,018 --> 00:27:00,010
That was three years ago.
We've tried to put it out of our minds.

401
00:27:00,178 --> 00:27:02,055
You keep digging it up.

402
00:27:02,258 --> 00:27:04,169
You're the DA of New Orleans.

403
00:27:04,337 --> 00:27:07,535
Isn't the Kennedy assassination
a bit out of your domain?

404
00:27:08,298 --> 00:27:10,492
All those important people studied it.

405
00:27:10,577 --> 00:27:14,890
I can't believe a man as intelligent
as Earl Warren read those volumes.

406
00:27:16,018 --> 00:27:17,451
Maybe you're right.

407
00:27:18,057 --> 00:27:21,892
You got an hour to solve the case
while I get the kids in bed.

408
00:27:22,738 --> 00:27:26,651
Then you're mine. Mr. Kennedy
will have to wait until morning.

409
00:27:31,377 --> 00:27:33,573
Look, Dad. Look what I drew.

410
00:27:34,218 --> 00:27:35,935
That's something. What is it?

411
00:27:36,018 --> 00:27:37,736
It's a rhino in a cage.

412
00:27:37,938 --> 00:27:41,248
-Can I stay up another hour?
-I don't think so, Son.

413
00:27:41,458 --> 00:27:43,653
Pickle and Snapper, my two...

414
00:27:44,298 --> 00:27:45,651
...dancing partners.

415
00:27:45,738 --> 00:27:47,648
Good night, doodlebugs.

416
00:27:48,178 --> 00:27:49,895
One hour, you hear?

417
00:27:50,698 --> 00:27:52,928
Some Saturday-night date you are.

418
00:27:53,137 --> 00:27:57,528
Mama warned me this would happen
if I married such a serious man as you.

419
00:27:57,938 --> 00:28:01,771
When I come up, I'll show you
how Saturday night got invented.

420
00:28:24,978 --> 00:28:29,289
<i>I sealed off the area and held off the trains</i>
<i>till they could be examined.</i>

421
00:28:29,577 --> 00:28:33,048
<i>There were some transients taken on</i>
<i>at least one train.</i>

422
00:28:34,698 --> 00:28:39,134
<i>Mr. Bowers, you already talked to us</i>
<i>about this matter. Is that correct?</i>

423
00:28:39,857 --> 00:28:40,813
<i>Yes.</i>

424
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:43,333
<i>Is there anything else you told us...</i>

425
00:28:43,498 --> 00:28:46,648
...that I haven't asked you about,
that you can think of?

426
00:28:47,617 --> 00:28:49,653
Nothing that I can recall.

427
00:28:50,337 --> 00:28:51,851
Witness is excused.

428
00:28:53,617 --> 00:28:54,892
A long freight was in there...

429
00:28:54,978 --> 00:28:58,367
...and we pulled some people off
and took them to the station.

430
00:29:01,298 --> 00:29:03,128
<i>Do you mean some transients?</i>

431
00:29:03,498 --> 00:29:04,851
Tramps and hobos.

432
00:29:04,938 --> 00:29:06,529
<i>Were they questioned?</i>

433
00:29:06,698 --> 00:29:09,132
<i>They were questioned at the station.</i>

434
00:29:09,897 --> 00:29:11,250
<i>Ask the question.</i>

435
00:29:12,298 --> 00:29:15,050
<i>Let's go back to that Amos Euins matter.</i>

436
00:29:16,178 --> 00:29:19,453
<i>Traffic had been cut off</i>
<i>into the area since 10:00.</i>

437
00:29:19,857 --> 00:29:22,611
<i>But three cars came in during this time...</i>

438
00:29:23,978 --> 00:29:27,015
<i>...from around noon till the time</i>
<i>of the shooting.</i>

439
00:29:27,498 --> 00:29:29,932
<i>They circled the parking lot and left.</i>

440
00:29:30,377 --> 00:29:32,686
Like they was checking the area.

441
00:29:33,577 --> 00:29:35,215
One of the drivers...

442
00:29:35,377 --> 00:29:37,049
...was holding something...

443
00:29:37,137 --> 00:29:38,570
...up to his mouth.

444
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:44,090
<i>The last car came in about seven</i>
<i>to ten minutes before the shooting.</i>

445
00:29:46,538 --> 00:29:49,371
<i>It was a white Chevrolet four</i>-<i>door Impala.</i>

446
00:29:49,938 --> 00:29:51,894
<i>Muddy up to the windows.</i>

447
00:29:53,298 --> 00:29:55,971
Towards the underpass, I saw two men...

448
00:29:56,657 --> 00:29:59,172
...standing behind a picket fence...

449
00:29:59,657 --> 00:30:03,333
<i>...looking up towards Main and Houston,</i>
<i>as the caravan came down.</i>

450
00:30:05,538 --> 00:30:07,449
<i>One of them was middle</i>-<i>aged...</i>

451
00:30:07,857 --> 00:30:09,086
<i>...heavyset.</i>

452
00:30:09,617 --> 00:30:11,653
<i>The other man was younger.</i>

453
00:30:12,178 --> 00:30:15,375
<i>Two other men were on the east end</i>
<i>of the parking lot.</i>

454
00:30:15,538 --> 00:30:17,289
<i>They both had uniforms.</i>

455
00:30:17,738 --> 00:30:19,968
<i>At the time of the shooting...</i>

456
00:30:20,178 --> 00:30:22,771
<i>...there seemed to be some commotion.</i>

457
00:30:24,778 --> 00:30:27,008
I'm just unable to describe...

458
00:30:28,417 --> 00:30:31,250
<i>...a flash of light or smoke or something...</i>

459
00:30:32,337 --> 00:30:35,454
<i>...which caused me to feel that something</i>
<i>out of the ordinary...</i>

460
00:30:35,538 --> 00:30:37,574
<i>...had occurred on the embankment.</i>

461
00:30:37,738 --> 00:30:38,727
Goddamn.

462
00:30:55,538 --> 00:30:56,492
No!

463
00:31:01,458 --> 00:31:04,131
-You all right?
-Honey, it's incredible.

464
00:31:04,778 --> 00:31:05,893
What?

465
00:31:06,258 --> 00:31:07,816
The whole thing.

466
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:10,688
A Lt. Colonel testifies that...

467
00:31:10,857 --> 00:31:14,896
...Oswald had a Russian language exam
as part of his Marine training...

468
00:31:15,057 --> 00:31:18,130
...only a few months before he defects
to the Soviet Union.

469
00:31:18,218 --> 00:31:19,730
A Russian exam.

470
00:31:20,018 --> 00:31:24,010
It's 4:30 in the morning!
I have five kids who'll wake up in an hour.

471
00:31:24,298 --> 00:31:28,928
In all my years in the military, I never knew
a single man who had a Russian test.

472
00:31:29,897 --> 00:31:31,808
Oswald was a radar operator.

473
00:31:32,298 --> 00:31:36,290
He'd have about as much use for Russian
as a cat has for pajamas.

474
00:31:36,657 --> 00:31:38,853
These books have gotten to your mind!

475
00:31:39,018 --> 00:31:41,770
-Stop reading.
-He makes it sound like nothing.

476
00:31:41,938 --> 00:31:43,815
Oswald did badly on his test.

477
00:31:44,298 --> 00:31:47,369
He got only two more Russian words right
than wrong.

478
00:31:47,657 --> 00:31:51,287
That's like me saying
Touchdown is not very intelligent...

479
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:55,207
...because I beat him three games
out of five when we played chess.

480
00:31:55,377 --> 00:31:59,053
Are you going to stay up all night,
every night? For what?

481
00:31:59,337 --> 00:32:02,647
To be the only man who's read
all 26 volumes of the Warren Report?

482
00:32:02,738 --> 00:32:04,968
Do I have to spell it out for you?

483
00:32:05,778 --> 00:32:08,246
Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.

484
00:32:09,097 --> 00:32:12,328
He was in military intelligence,
that's why he was trained in Russian.

485
00:32:12,417 --> 00:32:14,613
It was no accident he was in Russia.

486
00:32:14,698 --> 00:32:18,167
-Go back to sleep.
-I've been sleeping for three years!

487
00:32:35,538 --> 00:32:38,211
'Morning boys. Ready for a walking tour?

488
00:32:38,377 --> 00:32:41,768
7:30 Sunday morning?
Not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing.

489
00:32:42,057 --> 00:32:44,288
Old stains, but just as telling.

490
00:32:51,698 --> 00:32:53,494
531 Lafayette Street.

491
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:56,373
Remember whose office this was in '63?

492
00:32:57,577 --> 00:32:59,329
Sure. Guy Banister.

493
00:33:00,018 --> 00:33:02,737
Ex-FBI man. Died a couple of years ago.

494
00:33:05,258 --> 00:33:09,330
He headed the Chicago office. When he
retired he became a private eye here.

495
00:33:09,617 --> 00:33:13,292
I used to have lunch with him.
John Birch Society, Minutemen.

496
00:33:13,577 --> 00:33:15,534
To the right of Attila the Hun.

497
00:33:15,817 --> 00:33:19,810
<i>Recruited students to infiltrate</i>
<i>radical organizations on campus.</i>

498
00:33:20,337 --> 00:33:23,215
<i>Headed the Anti</i>-<i>Communist League</i>
<i>of the Caribbean.</i>

499
00:33:23,657 --> 00:33:25,568
All out of this office.

500
00:33:28,498 --> 00:33:30,534
I want to show you something.

501
00:33:38,377 --> 00:33:39,856
Take a look here.

502
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:42,049
544 Camp Street.

503
00:33:43,057 --> 00:33:44,855
531 Lafayette Street.

504
00:33:45,577 --> 00:33:47,329
Same building, right?

505
00:33:47,538 --> 00:33:51,451
Different addresses, different entrances,
both going to the same place...

506
00:33:52,018 --> 00:33:54,009
...to the office upstairs.

507
00:33:54,178 --> 00:33:55,691
Guess who used it?

508
00:33:57,897 --> 00:33:59,569
<i>Lee Harvey Oswald.</i>

509
00:34:00,778 --> 00:34:02,529
<i>How do we know that?</i>

510
00:34:02,857 --> 00:34:04,769
This address was stamped on...

511
00:34:04,978 --> 00:34:09,449
<i>...pro</i>-<i>Castro leaflets he handed out</i>
<i>in the summer of '63 on Canal Street.</i>

512
00:34:09,778 --> 00:34:13,087
<i>The same leaflets they found</i>
<i>in his garage in Dallas.</i>

513
00:34:15,857 --> 00:34:19,976
<i>After the arrest, 544 Camp St.</i>
<i>never appeared on the pamphlets again.</i>

514
00:34:20,778 --> 00:34:23,735
He was arrested for fighting
with anti-Castro Cubans.

515
00:34:24,458 --> 00:34:26,449
<i>But he'd contacted them already...</i>

516
00:34:26,538 --> 00:34:30,166
<i>...as an ex</i>-<i>Marine trying</i>
<i>to join their anti</i>-<i>Castro crusade.</i>

517
00:34:31,018 --> 00:34:34,806
<i>When they heard he was now pro</i>-<i>Castro,</i>
<i>they paid him a visit.</i>

518
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:37,056
What's this Fidel shit?

519
00:34:37,137 --> 00:34:38,650
You lied to me!

520
00:34:39,498 --> 00:34:41,135
Liar! Son of a bitch!

521
00:34:41,297 --> 00:34:43,686
Do not take this Communist propaganda!

522
00:34:45,097 --> 00:34:46,769
If you want to hit me, hit me.

523
00:34:46,858 --> 00:34:48,257
You pinko shit!

524
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:49,931
Go back to Moscow!

525
00:34:50,097 --> 00:34:51,610
<i>There was no real fight.</i>

526
00:34:51,697 --> 00:34:55,452
<i>The arresting Lieutenant later said</i>
<i>he felt it was a staged incident.</i>

527
00:34:56,137 --> 00:34:58,697
<i>In jail, Oswald has a private session...</i>

528
00:34:58,858 --> 00:35:01,577
<i>...with Special Agent John Quigley</i>
<i>of the FBI.</i>

529
00:35:02,217 --> 00:35:03,650
<i>Oswald is released.</i>

530
00:35:03,818 --> 00:35:06,570
<i>And Quigley destroys his notes</i>
<i>from the interview.</i>

531
00:35:06,858 --> 00:35:09,577
The arrest gets Oswald a lot of publicity.

532
00:35:09,737 --> 00:35:11,853
And he appears on a local TV debate.

533
00:35:12,137 --> 00:35:14,527
You are a Communist, are you not?

534
00:35:14,858 --> 00:35:17,655
No, Mr. Bringuier. I am not a Communist.

535
00:35:18,538 --> 00:35:19,936
I'm a Marxist-Leninist.

536
00:35:20,018 --> 00:35:23,293
Communist, Marxist-Leninist,
what's the difference?

537
00:35:24,617 --> 00:35:29,293
What if I told you Oswald was trained
in the Russian language in the Marines?

538
00:35:29,458 --> 00:35:31,813
I'd say he got intelligence training.

539
00:35:31,978 --> 00:35:34,047
You were a Marine. Who'd run it?

540
00:35:34,217 --> 00:35:36,128
Office of Naval Intelligence.

541
00:35:36,458 --> 00:35:38,369
Look across the street.

542
00:35:38,898 --> 00:35:40,297
Post Office.

543
00:35:40,617 --> 00:35:44,405
Upstairs, in 1963, that was
the Office of Naval Intelligence.

544
00:35:44,978 --> 00:35:48,333
By coincidence, Banister,
before he was FBl, was ONI.

545
00:35:48,777 --> 00:35:50,369
What's their saying?

546
00:35:50,538 --> 00:35:52,449
"Once ONl, always ONI."

547
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:55,085
He likes working near his old pals.

548
00:35:58,217 --> 00:36:00,208
We are standing in the heart of...

549
00:36:00,297 --> 00:36:03,608
...the US government's intelligence
community in New Orleans.

550
00:36:03,697 --> 00:36:04,925
That's the FBI.

551
00:36:05,137 --> 00:36:06,365
That's the CIA.

552
00:36:06,577 --> 00:36:08,250
That's the Secret Service.

553
00:36:08,338 --> 00:36:09,487
That's the ONI.

554
00:36:09,577 --> 00:36:11,853
Isn't this a strange place for...

555
00:36:11,938 --> 00:36:14,246
...a Communist to spend his spare time?

556
00:36:17,297 --> 00:36:19,208
What are you driving at?

557
00:36:22,217 --> 00:36:24,333
We're going back into the case.

558
00:36:25,097 --> 00:36:26,769
The murder of the President.

559
00:36:26,858 --> 00:36:29,088
Lord, wake me. I must be dreaming.

560
00:36:29,257 --> 00:36:31,532
You're awake. I'm deadly serious.

561
00:36:31,697 --> 00:36:35,134
Now, let's track down your
anonymous source from three years ago.

562
00:36:35,217 --> 00:36:38,289
<i>How'd you find out David Ferrie drove</i>
<i>to Texas that day?</i>

563
00:36:38,378 --> 00:36:42,166
<i>I can't remember last night,</i>
<i>let alone three years ago, Boss.</i>

564
00:36:46,378 --> 00:36:48,494
You're not being cross-examined.

565
00:36:48,657 --> 00:36:52,969
I need clarification about the night
Guy Banister beat you over the head.

566
00:36:53,137 --> 00:36:55,527
Don't tell me you don't remember.

567
00:36:55,818 --> 00:37:00,447
You called our office from your hospital
bed. You were hopping mad about it.

568
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:02,409
Here's my problem.

569
00:37:02,858 --> 00:37:06,088
You told me you and Guy were
good friends for a long time.

570
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:08,818
-Over ten years.
-And he never hit you before?

571
00:37:08,978 --> 00:37:10,376
Never touched me.

572
00:37:10,898 --> 00:37:13,092
Yet, on November 22, 1963, the day...

573
00:37:13,257 --> 00:37:15,135
...of the President's murder...

574
00:37:15,217 --> 00:37:17,288
...the police report says...

575
00:37:18,057 --> 00:37:20,936
...he pistol-whipped you
with a .357 Magnum.

576
00:37:21,617 --> 00:37:24,655
It also says you argued
about the phone bill. Look!

577
00:37:25,938 --> 00:37:29,931
Is an argument over a phone bill
a believable explanation to you?

578
00:37:32,938 --> 00:37:34,655
There's more to it.

579
00:37:35,818 --> 00:37:37,012
How much more?

580
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:38,811
I shouldn't talk about it.

581
00:37:38,898 --> 00:37:41,650
I'd ask Guy. We were friendly.
Heart attack?

582
00:37:42,858 --> 00:37:44,576
You buy what you read in the papers.

583
00:37:44,657 --> 00:37:47,570
-You have other information?
-I didn't say that!

584
00:37:47,737 --> 00:37:52,050
All I know is he died suddenly.
Just before the Warren Report came out.

585
00:37:55,018 --> 00:37:56,929
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?

586
00:38:04,458 --> 00:38:05,971
<i>You were the only one here!</i>

587
00:38:06,057 --> 00:38:07,456
<i>The only one here!</i>

588
00:38:11,978 --> 00:38:14,253
<i>You didn't see a goddamn thing!</i>

589
00:38:14,938 --> 00:38:19,329
Hell, Guy's dead, so it don't matter
no more. It was all about those...

590
00:38:19,818 --> 00:38:23,413
...people that was hanging
around the office that summer.

591
00:38:24,137 --> 00:38:26,367
I was never part of the operation.

592
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:30,166
I just handled their private-eye work
as it came in for Guy.

593
00:38:30,297 --> 00:38:33,096
Not much did, but that's why I was there.

594
00:38:34,137 --> 00:38:35,809
<i>It was a nuthouse.</i>

595
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:40,856
<i>Cubans coming, going. And Christ,</i>
<i>they all looked the same to me.</i>

596
00:38:42,538 --> 00:38:45,257
You going to play with this rifle or pack it?

597
00:38:45,498 --> 00:38:46,896
<i>Dave Ferrie.</i>

598
00:38:47,097 --> 00:38:50,295
-You know about him?
-We know Dave. Was he there?

599
00:38:50,538 --> 00:38:52,608
<i>He practically lived there.</i>

600
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:56,494
<i>The whole thing was all...</i>

601
00:38:56,858 --> 00:38:58,893
<i>...cloak</i>-<i>and</i>-<i>dagger stuff.</i>

602
00:38:59,177 --> 00:39:01,612
They called it "Operation Mongoose."

603
00:39:02,938 --> 00:39:06,931
The idea was to train these Cuban exiles
for another invasion of Cuba.

604
00:39:07,577 --> 00:39:10,297
Banister's office was part
of the supply line...

605
00:39:10,378 --> 00:39:13,016
<i>...from Dallas through New Orleans</i>
<i>to Miami.</i>

606
00:39:13,257 --> 00:39:15,168
<i>We stockpiled arms, explosives.</i>

607
00:39:15,338 --> 00:39:18,454
<i>In view of the intelligence community</i>
<i>in Lafayette Square?</i>

608
00:39:18,538 --> 00:39:22,610
<i>Yes. Everybody knew everybody.</i>
<i>They were all part of the network.</i>

609
00:39:23,018 --> 00:39:24,769
<i>All worked for the CIA.</i>

610
00:39:25,657 --> 00:39:29,286
Pilots and black operators
and civilians and the military.

611
00:39:30,657 --> 00:39:32,648
Everybody was running guns then.

612
00:39:33,818 --> 00:39:36,775
<i>Ft. Jefferson, Bayou Bluff,</i>
<i>Morgan City, you name it.</i>

613
00:39:37,097 --> 00:39:39,771
<i>McAllen, Texas? Big gun</i>-<i>run operation.</i>

614
00:39:43,978 --> 00:39:45,730
<i>Where does Banister fit in?</i>

615
00:39:46,018 --> 00:39:49,090
<i>He was running his camp</i>
<i>north of Lake Pontchartrain.</i>

616
00:39:49,257 --> 00:39:51,248
<i>Ferrie did a lot of the training.</i>

617
00:39:51,338 --> 00:39:55,251
<i>They had a shooting range</i>
<i>and tropical territory, like in Cuba.</i>

618
00:39:56,137 --> 00:39:58,492
<i>Some Americans were trained there too.</i>

619
00:39:58,777 --> 00:40:00,608
<i>Nazi types. Mercenaries.</i>

620
00:40:01,257 --> 00:40:04,375
<i>That Ferrie, though.</i>
<i>Jesus, he was the craziest.</i>

621
00:40:05,978 --> 00:40:10,369
<i>Late summer the party was over.</i>
<i>Kennedy didn't want another Bay of Pigs.</i>

622
00:40:11,938 --> 00:40:14,168
<i>He told the FBl, "Shut up the camp."</i>

623
00:40:14,297 --> 00:40:16,527
<i>"Confiscate the napalm, C</i>-<i>4 and all."</i>

624
00:40:17,418 --> 00:40:20,376
<i>The G</i>-<i>men were just going</i>
<i>through the motions.</i>

625
00:40:20,898 --> 00:40:24,173
<i>Their hearts were still</i>
<i>with their old FBI buddy Banister.</i>

626
00:40:26,777 --> 00:40:27,972
Oswald?

627
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:34,096
He was there too.

628
00:40:35,018 --> 00:40:37,327
<i>Sometimes meeting with Banister.</i>

629
00:40:40,217 --> 00:40:41,650
<i>With the door shut.</i>

630
00:40:44,657 --> 00:40:48,172
<i>Shootin' the bull with Ferrie, whatever.</i>
<i>But he was there, all right.</i>

631
00:40:48,257 --> 00:40:49,929
<i>Was anyone else involved at...</i>

632
00:40:50,018 --> 00:40:51,496
...Banister's level?

633
00:40:52,097 --> 00:40:54,168
One guy. I don't know who.

634
00:40:54,978 --> 00:40:56,615
<i>Big. White hair.</i>

635
00:40:57,378 --> 00:41:00,733
<i>I saw him in the office once.</i>
<i>He looked out of place.</i>

636
00:41:01,018 --> 00:41:02,974
<i>You know, a society guy.</i>

637
00:41:03,498 --> 00:41:06,217
<i>Can't remember his name,</i>
<i>but Oswald was with him.</i>

638
00:41:07,938 --> 00:41:11,726
<i>He had something to do with money,</i>
<i>because Banister never kissed ass...</i>

639
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:13,934
<i>...but he kissed his.</i>

640
00:41:21,018 --> 00:41:21,927
<i>Clay something.</i>

641
00:41:22,018 --> 00:41:24,088
<i>That was his name. Clay....</i>

642
00:41:24,257 --> 00:41:25,327
-Bertrand?
-Yeah.

643
00:41:25,418 --> 00:41:27,612
-Clay Bertrand?
-I don't know.

644
00:41:29,217 --> 00:41:30,617
-Maybe not.
-No, that's right.

645
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:31,652
I must go.

646
00:41:31,737 --> 00:41:34,650
He was in the Warren Report.
He got Oswald a lawyer.

647
00:41:35,458 --> 00:41:36,856
Was Kennedy discussed?

648
00:41:36,938 --> 00:41:38,132
I don't know.

649
00:41:38,697 --> 00:41:40,369
-The assassination?
-No.

650
00:41:40,777 --> 00:41:43,052
-Not with me. I've got to go.
-Hold on.

651
00:41:43,137 --> 00:41:45,572
-That's all I'll say.
-What's the problem?

652
00:41:49,538 --> 00:41:51,574
Do I have to spell it out for you?

653
00:41:51,657 --> 00:41:54,217
Nobody knows what
we're talking about here.

654
00:41:55,617 --> 00:41:57,414
Oh, you are so naive.

655
00:42:07,297 --> 00:42:11,085
-When'd you do business with Bertrand?
-Pipe the bimbo in red.

656
00:42:12,978 --> 00:42:13,853
Lawdy.

657
00:42:14,018 --> 00:42:15,769
She's not as cute as you.

658
00:42:17,177 --> 00:42:21,056
-You should try a legitimate business.
-Why are you dancing on my head?

659
00:42:21,137 --> 00:42:24,255
-We've been friends since law school.
-Because you're conning me.

660
00:42:24,338 --> 00:42:26,976
-I read your testimony.
-Grain of salt.

661
00:42:27,137 --> 00:42:30,972
You said Clay Bertrand called you
the day after the assassination...

662
00:42:31,137 --> 00:42:33,856
-...and asked you to be Oswald's lawyer.
-Right.

663
00:42:34,978 --> 00:42:36,889
That's pretty important.

664
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:41,289
You told the FBI he's 6-foot two.
Then you tell the Commission he's 5-foot 8.

665
00:42:41,858 --> 00:42:44,530
How the hell does a man shrink like that?

666
00:42:44,697 --> 00:42:49,010
They put the heat on me, like you. I gave
them whatever popped in my cabeza.

667
00:42:49,538 --> 00:42:51,608
Truth is, I never met the dude.

668
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:54,769
-One likes friends that have friends.
-lndeed.

669
00:42:55,297 --> 00:42:58,335
I don't know what that cat looks like
or where he's at.

670
00:42:58,498 --> 00:43:01,331
All I know is sometimes
he sends me some cases.

671
00:43:01,498 --> 00:43:04,967
One day he calls, talks to me
about repping Oswald in Dallas.

672
00:43:05,177 --> 00:43:07,407
You ever speak to Oswald in Dallas?

673
00:43:07,577 --> 00:43:11,047
I told that Bertrand cat right off
this ain't my scene.

674
00:43:11,577 --> 00:43:15,570
-I'm a hack. He needs a hot dog.
-Then how did you get in the Commission?

675
00:43:16,217 --> 00:43:18,288
Like I told the Washington boys...

676
00:43:18,418 --> 00:43:22,615
...Bertrand asked me that summer to help
the kid upgrade his Marine discharge.

677
00:43:23,858 --> 00:43:26,246
Mr. Bertrand said he would take care
of any of--

678
00:43:26,338 --> 00:43:27,213
Fine.

679
00:43:27,617 --> 00:43:31,577
-To whom am I speaking?
-<i>Clay Bertrand. I'll pay what they owe.</i>

680
00:43:31,737 --> 00:43:35,777
There was no conspiracy. If there was,
why didn't Bobby Kennedy prosecute?

681
00:43:35,898 --> 00:43:37,615
He was his brother.

682
00:43:38,338 --> 00:43:40,726
How'd so many people keep such a secret?

683
00:43:41,538 --> 00:43:45,213
-lt was Oswald. He hated--
-We're having a communication problem.

684
00:43:45,378 --> 00:43:49,849
I know you know who Clay Bertrand is.
Stop eating that crabmeat and listen.

685
00:43:49,978 --> 00:43:54,210
I'm aware of our friendship,
but I'll call you before the grand jury.

686
00:43:54,818 --> 00:43:58,606
You lie to them as you lied to me,
I'll charge you with perjury.

687
00:43:58,818 --> 00:44:01,251
I took nine judges on here in New Orleans.

688
00:44:01,378 --> 00:44:04,335
I beat them all.
Am I communicating with you?

689
00:44:06,177 --> 00:44:07,610
Off the record?

690
00:44:09,418 --> 00:44:11,806
In that case, let me sum it up for you.

691
00:44:16,057 --> 00:44:18,652
If I answer that question you keep asking...

692
00:44:19,498 --> 00:44:22,376
...if I give you the name
of the big enchilada...

693
00:44:23,617 --> 00:44:25,449
...then it's <i>bon voyage</i>, Deano.

694
00:44:25,538 --> 00:44:27,768
Like a bullet in my head, you dig?

695
00:44:28,257 --> 00:44:31,806
You're a mouse fighting a gorilla.
JFK's dead as that crabmeat.

696
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:34,766
The government's still breathing.

697
00:44:34,978 --> 00:44:38,492
Either you give the grand jury
Clay Bertrand's real identity...

698
00:44:38,657 --> 00:44:41,217
...or your fat behind's
going to the slammer.

699
00:44:41,697 --> 00:44:44,576
You're as crazy as your mama.
It's in the genes.

700
00:44:45,378 --> 00:44:47,766
Do you know what you're getting into?

701
00:44:47,978 --> 00:44:51,811
The government will jump all over
your head and go cock-a-doodle-doo.

702
00:44:52,777 --> 00:44:54,449
Good day to you, sir.

703
00:44:59,657 --> 00:45:02,775
<i>District Attorney Garrison</i>
<i>to see Prisoner 5388.</i>

704
00:45:03,097 --> 00:45:04,690
<i>Ward block 23</i>7<i>8.</i>

705
00:45:18,418 --> 00:45:20,534
We don't need gates with that swamp.

706
00:45:20,938 --> 00:45:23,735
Many of them gone in there,
none of them came out.

707
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:40,855
You got visitors here.
Don't give them trouble.

708
00:45:41,177 --> 00:45:44,135
-How you doing, Mr. Broussard?
-Let's go, Willie.

709
00:45:55,858 --> 00:45:58,452
Thank you, Mr. O'Keefe, for this time.

710
00:45:58,737 --> 00:46:00,376
I got nothing but time.

711
00:46:01,177 --> 00:46:03,532
Minutes, hours, days. Years of it.

712
00:46:03,818 --> 00:46:07,128
Time stands still here,
like a snake sunning itself.

713
00:46:08,538 --> 00:46:09,731
Clay Bertrand?

714
00:46:13,378 --> 00:46:15,333
I met him sometime in...

715
00:46:15,737 --> 00:46:18,251
...June of '62. The Masquerade Bar.

716
00:46:18,898 --> 00:46:21,617
Dave Ferrie took me there
expressly to meet him.

717
00:46:22,338 --> 00:46:23,657
Sexual purposes?

718
00:46:25,137 --> 00:46:26,331
Did he pay you?

719
00:46:26,418 --> 00:46:29,807
$20 each time. Ain't no secret.
That's what I'm in here for.

720
00:46:30,217 --> 00:46:31,570
Anything unusual about him...

721
00:46:31,657 --> 00:46:33,648
<i>...you'd be able to describe in court?</i>

722
00:46:33,737 --> 00:46:36,251
<i>He had something wrong with his leg.</i>
<i>A limp.</i>

723
00:46:36,538 --> 00:46:39,655
<i>Don't get me wrong.</i>
<i>He's not one of those limp wrists.</i>

724
00:46:39,978 --> 00:46:42,811
<i>He's a butch John. Meet him on the street,</i>
<i>you'd never snap.</i>

725
00:46:42,898 --> 00:46:46,652
<i>You could play poker with him</i>,
<i>go fishing, you'd never snap.</i>

726
00:46:48,057 --> 00:46:50,413
One night we were at David Ferrie's...

727
00:46:50,577 --> 00:46:53,251
<i>...some time late in the summer of '63.</i>

728
00:46:54,777 --> 00:46:57,291
<i>There was about nine to ten people there.</i>

729
00:46:57,577 --> 00:47:02,014
<i>Cuban. Friends who'd done stuff</i>
<i>in the bush with him. Place was a mess.</i>

730
00:47:02,177 --> 00:47:05,010
<i>Dave's mind was a mess.</i>
<i>He had caged mice...</i>

731
00:47:05,217 --> 00:47:07,606
<i>...'cause he's working on a cancer cure.</i>

732
00:47:09,257 --> 00:47:12,135
<i>Dave's smart, though.</i>
<i>Speaks five languages.</i>

733
00:47:13,257 --> 00:47:16,728
<i>Knows philosophy, medicine,</i>
<i>military history, politics.</i>

734
00:47:17,018 --> 00:47:20,931
He wanted to be a priest.
They defrocked him 'cause he was queer.

735
00:47:21,217 --> 00:47:23,652
That's where you first met Oswald?

736
00:47:23,978 --> 00:47:26,538
<i>Strange guy. Dave introduced him as....</i>

737
00:47:26,697 --> 00:47:27,925
Leon Oswald.

738
00:47:28,097 --> 00:47:29,577
How you doing?

739
00:47:30,217 --> 00:47:32,128
What the fuck is he doing here?

740
00:47:32,217 --> 00:47:34,128
Fuck you, motherfucker.

741
00:47:36,057 --> 00:47:38,856
Leon's in a bad mood. Don't get excited.

742
00:47:39,657 --> 00:47:42,012
You said Leon was actually
Lee Harvey Oswald?

743
00:47:42,097 --> 00:47:44,373
Yeah. I have no reason to lie to you.

744
00:47:45,097 --> 00:47:46,815
I'm already in jail.

745
00:47:46,978 --> 00:47:47,932
Go on.

746
00:47:48,057 --> 00:47:51,050
Finally they left and I was alone
with Dave...

747
00:47:51,737 --> 00:47:53,170
...and this Leon...

748
00:47:53,257 --> 00:47:56,010
...two of the Cubans,
and this guy Bertrand.

749
00:47:56,978 --> 00:47:59,253
<i>Dave pulled out some clippings.</i>

750
00:47:59,617 --> 00:48:03,054
<i>He'd been obsessed with Castro</i>
<i>and Kennedy for months.</i>

751
00:48:03,378 --> 00:48:06,688
Little ass-wipe closed down the camps!
Took our C-4!

752
00:48:07,057 --> 00:48:10,050
Took 10,000 rounds!
3,000 pounds of gunpowder!

753
00:48:10,858 --> 00:48:12,177
All our weapons!

754
00:48:14,338 --> 00:48:16,726
You want to free Cuba?
Whack out the fucking beard!

755
00:48:16,818 --> 00:48:19,775
Kennedy won't let us.
Our hands are empty. How can we?

756
00:48:19,858 --> 00:48:22,735
Problem is getting to him.
Informers on every block.

757
00:48:22,818 --> 00:48:24,331
They got new stuff!

758
00:48:24,657 --> 00:48:29,048
I could show you dozens of poisons!
Put it in his food, he'd die in three days.

759
00:48:29,217 --> 00:48:30,492
No trace!

760
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:34,650
Put something in his beard,
make it fall out. He'd look ridiculous....

761
00:48:35,458 --> 00:48:39,849
Fucking Kennedy is doing all kinds of deals
with that bastard Khrushchev.

762
00:48:40,498 --> 00:48:41,931
Licking his ass.

763
00:48:43,777 --> 00:48:48,329
An inspired act of God should happen
here and put a Texan in the White House!

764
00:48:49,458 --> 00:48:51,847
The Cubans left. Dave was drunk.

765
00:48:53,697 --> 00:48:55,653
<i>He started in on Kennedy again.</i>

766
00:48:56,097 --> 00:48:59,215
I will kill! In the White House!
Stab him in the heart!

767
00:48:59,657 --> 00:49:01,614
Somebody must get rid of him!

768
00:49:02,577 --> 00:49:04,887
You won't get that son of a bitch!

769
00:49:05,057 --> 00:49:08,414
It won't be long. That fucker
will get what he deserves.

770
00:49:08,498 --> 00:49:11,728
It could be blamed on Castro,
the country will want to invade Cuba.

771
00:49:11,818 --> 00:49:13,967
We just need to get him in the open.

772
00:49:14,898 --> 00:49:17,172
Always some harebrained scheme.

773
00:49:20,657 --> 00:49:23,411
Let's have some more champagne,
shall we?

774
00:49:23,858 --> 00:49:26,291
What about the Secret Service? The cops?

775
00:49:26,418 --> 00:49:29,932
If it's planned right, no problem.
They got close to De Gaulle.

776
00:49:30,097 --> 00:49:32,213
Eisenhower always rode in open top.

777
00:49:32,338 --> 00:49:35,295
We need three mechanics
in three different locations.

778
00:49:35,697 --> 00:49:38,132
An office building, a high-powered rifle.

779
00:49:38,257 --> 00:49:41,773
Triangulation of crossfire, that's the key.
That's the key.

780
00:49:42,338 --> 00:49:45,135
A diversionary shot gets the Secret Service
looking one way.

781
00:49:45,217 --> 00:49:47,048
Boom! Get the kill shot.

782
00:49:47,858 --> 00:49:49,849
One man has to be sacrificed.

783
00:49:51,057 --> 00:49:53,447
In the commotion, the job gets done.

784
00:49:53,697 --> 00:49:55,574
The others leave the country.

785
00:49:55,777 --> 00:49:59,929
Let's drop this subject.
It's one thing to banter with these kids...

786
00:50:00,257 --> 00:50:03,932
...but this sort of thing could be
so easily misunderstood.

787
00:50:04,898 --> 00:50:08,333
<i>I didn't think much about it then.</i>
<i>It's just bullshit.</i>

788
00:50:08,498 --> 00:50:10,965
People like to act more important
than they are.

789
00:50:11,057 --> 00:50:13,447
Especially in the homosexual underworld.

790
00:50:14,418 --> 00:50:16,170
But when they got him...

791
00:50:16,498 --> 00:50:17,931
...I got scared.

792
00:50:18,177 --> 00:50:19,530
Real scared.

793
00:50:20,018 --> 00:50:21,690
That's when I got popped.

794
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:25,135
The things you said will be attacked
by many people.

795
00:50:25,297 --> 00:50:29,291
Bring them on. Bring their college degrees
in here, I got nothing to hide.

796
00:50:29,458 --> 00:50:31,130
No one can buy me.

797
00:50:32,177 --> 00:50:34,737
-I don't even need this parole.
-What parole?

798
00:50:35,137 --> 00:50:39,255
You liberal, you don't know shit
'cause you never been fucked in the ass.

799
00:50:39,858 --> 00:50:43,054
This ain't about justice!
No, this is about order!

800
00:50:43,938 --> 00:50:46,246
Who rules? Fascism is coming back.

801
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:49,887
Nobody wants to buy you.
No one's promising you parole.

802
00:50:52,097 --> 00:50:55,373
What I need to know
is why are you telling us this.

803
00:50:56,737 --> 00:50:58,967
'Cause that motherfucker Kennedy...

804
00:50:59,137 --> 00:51:01,856
...stole that motherfucking election,
that's why.

805
00:51:02,018 --> 00:51:06,010
Nixon was going to be a great President
until Kennedy wrecked this country.

806
00:51:06,177 --> 00:51:09,853
Niggers wanting rights!
Why do you think we have all this crime.

807
00:51:10,018 --> 00:51:12,577
He promised those motherfuckers
too much!

808
00:51:12,818 --> 00:51:15,695
Revolution's coming, bullshit!
Fascism's coming back!

809
00:51:15,777 --> 00:51:19,452
The day that Communist son of a bitch
died was a great day!

810
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:22,373
A great day for this country.

811
00:51:22,657 --> 00:51:26,094
I hate to think they blame it
on silly, fucking Oswald.

812
00:51:26,657 --> 00:51:28,648
Didn't know shit, anyway.

813
00:51:28,898 --> 00:51:32,413
People got to know.
People got to know why he was killed.

814
00:51:32,818 --> 00:51:34,887
Because he was a Communist.

815
00:51:36,097 --> 00:51:40,376
You go ahead, put me on the stand,
I'll tell the same goddamned story!

816
00:51:40,617 --> 00:51:42,050
Don't matter to me!

817
00:51:43,697 --> 00:51:45,768
All right, Willie. Thanks.

818
00:51:46,737 --> 00:51:48,137
We'll be in touch.

819
00:51:48,418 --> 00:51:49,612
All right.

820
00:51:54,577 --> 00:51:57,251
You know, you're not a bad-looking man.

821
00:51:57,538 --> 00:51:58,731
Not bad at all.

822
00:51:59,297 --> 00:52:02,210
I get out of here, I'll come see you.
We can have fun!

823
00:52:02,818 --> 00:52:05,206
Their testimony won't hold up in court.

824
00:52:05,378 --> 00:52:08,335
Their reputations are lower
than crocodile piss.

825
00:52:08,577 --> 00:52:10,170
That bothers you?

826
00:52:11,538 --> 00:52:15,213
If a woman's a prostitute,
must she also have bad eyesight?

827
00:52:16,898 --> 00:52:20,014
Find Clay Bertrand. Start by checking
around the Quarter.

828
00:52:20,097 --> 00:52:22,896
The six of us, with almost no budget
and in secret...

829
00:52:22,978 --> 00:52:25,856
...will solve a case
the Warren Commission couldn't?

830
00:52:26,018 --> 00:52:29,215
-I didn't pick you for your legal skill.
-Thanks, Boss.

831
00:52:29,378 --> 00:52:33,166
You're a fighter. I like a man
who's not afraid of bad odds.

832
00:52:33,378 --> 00:52:36,016
Mr. Garrison, how are you?
Remember me?

833
00:52:36,418 --> 00:52:37,692
You vote for me?

834
00:52:37,858 --> 00:52:41,134
I did. We sang together
at the Royal Orleans, remember?

835
00:52:41,297 --> 00:52:42,333
We sang:

836
00:52:42,498 --> 00:52:44,773
"You're the cream in my coffee."

837
00:52:47,297 --> 00:52:49,492
Haven't seen you much lately.

838
00:52:49,697 --> 00:52:53,690
Been too busy. Elected men can't have
as much fun as they used to.

839
00:52:53,858 --> 00:52:57,134
It's always nice to see you.
Pleasure to serve you always.

840
00:52:58,657 --> 00:53:00,887
How are you? Nice to see you.

841
00:53:02,018 --> 00:53:03,610
Welcome back, Lou.

842
00:53:05,057 --> 00:53:08,572
-Think I could get a martini?
-They're waiting for you, sir.

843
00:53:09,617 --> 00:53:11,608
Keep that table open for us.

844
00:53:14,418 --> 00:53:16,170
Anything on the hoboes?

845
00:53:16,577 --> 00:53:19,728
<i>Dallas Times Herald</i> photographer
got great shots.

846
00:53:20,577 --> 00:53:22,090
Never published.

847
00:53:24,097 --> 00:53:26,565
Can't say that comes as a surprise.

848
00:53:28,097 --> 00:53:32,568
They took them to the sheriff's
and let them go. No record of questioning.

849
00:53:32,737 --> 00:53:35,456
Do they look like the hoboes
you remember?

850
00:53:36,737 --> 00:53:38,489
These two look young.

851
00:53:38,657 --> 00:53:42,253
Not a frayed collar or cuff,
fresh haircuts and shaves...

852
00:53:42,978 --> 00:53:46,766
-...clean hands, new shoe leather.
-Who the hell are they then?

853
00:53:49,697 --> 00:53:50,813
Sit down.

854
00:53:53,137 --> 00:53:55,697
This could be it. Let's look for them.

855
00:53:56,737 --> 00:54:01,367
What about the railroad man, Lee Bowers,
who saw the men at the picket fence?

856
00:54:01,697 --> 00:54:04,166
<i>Graveyard. Dead. August this year.</i>

857
00:54:04,577 --> 00:54:08,092
<i>Single</i>-<i>car accident on an empty road</i>
<i>in Midlothian, Texas.</i>

858
00:54:08,338 --> 00:54:11,375
The doctor said he was in a strange shock
when he died.

859
00:54:11,858 --> 00:54:14,132
We need to find more witnesses.

860
00:54:14,498 --> 00:54:16,489
<i>There was Rose Cheramie, a whore.</i>

861
00:54:16,577 --> 00:54:19,536
<i>She said she was a dope runner</i>
<i>for Jack Ruby.</i>

862
00:54:20,097 --> 00:54:22,612
And that Ruby knew Oswald for years.

863
00:54:23,938 --> 00:54:26,371
-<i>Can we talk to her?</i>
-<i>She's dead too.</i>

864
00:54:27,137 --> 00:54:28,411
Hit and run.

865
00:54:33,217 --> 00:54:35,777
Why don't we go to the horse's mouth?

866
00:54:36,018 --> 00:54:40,568
Jack Ruby's been in a Dallas jail cell
for three years. Maybe he'll crack.

867
00:54:40,898 --> 00:54:44,891
Can't. If I go to him our investigation
will hit the front pages.

868
00:54:45,057 --> 00:54:48,891
It'll blow up in our face.
Susie, what did you find on Oswald?

869
00:54:49,617 --> 00:54:52,416
Negative on his tax records. Classified.

870
00:54:52,978 --> 00:54:55,538
First time a DA can't get a tax record.

871
00:54:56,177 --> 00:55:00,568
<i>I asked for the CIA files on Oswald</i>
<i>that were part of the Warren Report.</i>

872
00:55:01,617 --> 00:55:04,496
About 1,200 documents.
Can't get one of them.

873
00:55:05,697 --> 00:55:09,213
<i>All classified as secret on the grounds</i>
<i>of national security.</i>

874
00:55:09,378 --> 00:55:13,451
Gave me his grammar school records.
It's a study of his pubic hairs.

875
00:55:14,097 --> 00:55:15,690
<i>Lonely kid, no father.</i>

876
00:55:16,057 --> 00:55:18,014
<i>Joins the Marines at 1</i>7.

877
00:55:18,577 --> 00:55:21,217
Learns Russian. Acts overtly Marxist.

878
00:55:21,777 --> 00:55:25,213
<i>But he's stationed at a top</i>-<i>secret air base</i>
<i>in Japan...</i>

879
00:55:25,458 --> 00:55:28,255
<i>...where U</i>-<i>2 spy flights</i>
<i>over Russia originate.</i>

880
00:55:28,737 --> 00:55:30,251
He's discharged...

881
00:55:30,418 --> 00:55:33,853
...supposedly because his mother's sick.
Stays home three days.

882
00:55:33,938 --> 00:55:38,215
<i>Then, with a $1,500 ticket from</i>
<i>a $203 bank account, he goes to Moscow.</i>

883
00:55:38,898 --> 00:55:40,967
<i>Mr. Oswald, do you understand...</i>

884
00:55:41,137 --> 00:55:44,414
-...the action you are about to take?
-Yes, I do, sir.

885
00:55:46,938 --> 00:55:49,088
I wish to renounce my citizenship...

886
00:55:49,777 --> 00:55:52,052
...and become a Soviet citizen.

887
00:55:53,057 --> 00:55:56,652
I'll give them all the information
I have on the Marines.

888
00:55:57,458 --> 00:56:00,416
He disappears for six weeks,
presumably with the KGB.

889
00:56:00,898 --> 00:56:03,458
He's taken to a radio factory in Minsk...

890
00:56:03,617 --> 00:56:06,815
...where he lives as high on the hog
as he ever has.

891
00:56:06,978 --> 00:56:10,572
<i>He's given 5,000 rubles,</i>
<i>a roomy apartment with a balcony.</i>

892
00:56:11,697 --> 00:56:13,653
<i>Has affairs with local girls.</i>

893
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:15,648
Makes sense. He's a spokesman.

894
00:56:17,418 --> 00:56:20,215
But he never does any propaganda
for the Russians.

895
00:56:21,538 --> 00:56:22,971
<i>He meets Marina.</i>

896
00:56:23,378 --> 00:56:26,369
<i>Her uncle is a colonel</i>
<i>in Soviet intelligence.</i>

897
00:56:28,097 --> 00:56:30,327
She thinks he's Russian by his speech.

898
00:56:30,418 --> 00:56:33,295
<i>Six weeks later they marry,</i>
<i>have a daughter.</i>

899
00:56:33,458 --> 00:56:37,610
Only explanation for the royal treatment
is he gave them radar secrets.

900
00:56:37,777 --> 00:56:39,210
Or fake secrets.

901
00:56:39,378 --> 00:56:41,208
Six months after he's in Russia...

902
00:56:41,297 --> 00:56:44,494
<i>...Francis Gary Powers' U</i>-<i>2 spy flight</i>
<i>goes down...</i>

903
00:56:44,978 --> 00:56:47,286
<i>...in Russia. That plane was untouchable.</i>

904
00:56:47,378 --> 00:56:49,289
Powers hinted that Oswald...

905
00:56:49,458 --> 00:56:52,494
...could've given the Russians
enough data to hit it.

906
00:56:52,657 --> 00:56:56,650
As a result, the peace summit between
Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.

907
00:56:56,898 --> 00:57:00,527
<i>Perhaps our military didn't want</i>
<i>the conference to happen?</i>

908
00:57:02,018 --> 00:57:04,248
Maybe Oswald was part of that!

909
00:57:05,217 --> 00:57:08,688
-Stick to what you can prove in court.
-You want facts?

910
00:57:10,257 --> 00:57:13,295
Don't get sidetracked.
How'd he get back to the States?

911
00:57:13,538 --> 00:57:16,097
Does he have any problems
with Uncle Sam?

912
00:57:16,257 --> 00:57:19,648
No. The State Department issues him
a new passport in 48 hours...

913
00:57:19,737 --> 00:57:21,648
...and loans him travel money.

914
00:57:22,498 --> 00:57:26,809
He's never investigated or charged
for revealing classified information...

915
00:57:27,458 --> 00:57:30,097
...or, as far as we know,
debriefed by the CIA.

916
00:57:30,257 --> 00:57:34,170
Bastard should've been prosecuted
as a traitor when he got off the boat.

917
00:57:34,978 --> 00:57:37,286
<i>Did Marina have problems getting out?</i>

918
00:57:37,458 --> 00:57:41,576
None, though it's almost impossible
to get Russian sweethearts out.

919
00:57:42,177 --> 00:57:46,568
This is a man who defected once already.
It's crazy. Ordinary people...

920
00:57:47,057 --> 00:57:49,617
...get blacklisted
for having leftist affiliations.

921
00:57:49,697 --> 00:57:51,210
Doesn't add up.

922
00:57:51,378 --> 00:57:54,653
Next thing, he's living
in Dallas-Fort Worth, October '62...

923
00:57:55,018 --> 00:57:57,929
<i>...working six months</i>
<i>at Jaggars</i>-<i>Chiles</i>-<i>Stovall...</i>

924
00:57:58,097 --> 00:58:01,407
<i>...a photographic firm that makes maps</i>
<i>for the US Army.</i>

925
00:58:02,577 --> 00:58:05,887
<i>Oswald becomes chummy with</i>
<i>the Dallas White Russian community.</i>

926
00:58:05,978 --> 00:58:07,650
<i>All rabid anti</i>-<i>Communists.</i>

927
00:58:08,018 --> 00:58:09,007
It's odd.

928
00:58:09,177 --> 00:58:12,375
<i>The Oswalds are introduced</i>
<i>to Janet and Bill Williams.</i>

929
00:58:12,458 --> 00:58:16,690
<i>It's through Janet Williams,</i>
<i>in October '63, that Lee gets the job...</i>

930
00:58:17,057 --> 00:58:20,572
...at the warehouse on Elm Street
at the Book Depository.

931
00:58:21,057 --> 00:58:25,688
<i>So he can now exercise his intellect,</i>
<i>stacking school texts at $1.25 an hour.</i>

932
00:58:27,418 --> 00:58:30,215
<i>Marina fights with Lee about many things.</i>

933
00:58:32,498 --> 00:58:34,568
His secrecy, their lack of money.

934
00:58:35,418 --> 00:58:38,295
<i>She says that Lee is not sexually adequate.</i>

935
00:58:40,978 --> 00:58:43,047
Lee hits her on several occasions.

936
00:58:44,057 --> 00:58:45,615
<i>At the age of 24...</i>

937
00:58:45,777 --> 00:58:49,054
<i>...he rents a room in Dallas</i>
<i>under the alias of O.H. Lee.</i>

938
00:58:49,177 --> 00:58:52,010
Do you want to watch TV?
Are you all right?

939
00:58:53,018 --> 00:58:54,929
No, thank you. I'm fine.

940
00:58:55,898 --> 00:58:59,606
All I know about the Williams is
their tax returns are classified.

941
00:58:59,858 --> 00:59:03,213
<i>Bill Williams has links to the CIA</i>
<i>through his family...</i>

942
00:59:03,418 --> 00:59:05,931
<i>...does classified work for Bell Helicopter.</i>

943
00:59:06,097 --> 00:59:10,614
<i>Bill's convenient separation from Janet</i>
<i>allows Marina to move into her house...</i>

944
00:59:10,777 --> 00:59:13,576
<i>...where she suddenly becomes</i>
<i>Marina's best friend.</i>

945
00:59:13,657 --> 00:59:16,536
<i>There Marina and Lee</i>
<i>have a second daughter.</i>

946
00:59:17,978 --> 00:59:20,856
<i>I have to go away. Just for a short while.</i>

947
00:59:21,018 --> 00:59:22,929
What's wrong with this family?

948
00:59:23,217 --> 00:59:24,650
<i>I love Lee...</i>

949
00:59:25,657 --> 00:59:27,215
<i>...and I sorry him.</i>

950
00:59:27,458 --> 00:59:28,936
<i>Sorry for him?</i>

951
00:59:29,418 --> 00:59:30,248
<i>Yes.</i>

952
00:59:30,338 --> 00:59:33,329
When he's arrested,
Marina buries him with the public.

953
00:59:33,498 --> 00:59:36,648
She describes him as a psychotic
and violent man.

954
00:59:36,858 --> 00:59:38,449
I have too much facts...

955
00:59:38,617 --> 00:59:41,496
...and facts tell me that Lee shot Kennedy.

956
00:59:42,458 --> 00:59:45,813
After being locked away
by the feds for two months...

957
00:59:46,097 --> 00:59:48,134
...and afraid she'd be deported...

958
00:59:48,217 --> 00:59:51,449
...she was probably suffering
from nervous exhaustion.

959
00:59:51,577 --> 00:59:53,614
<i>They taught her how to answer.</i>

960
00:59:54,137 --> 00:59:56,936
When they think she's ready,
they buy her dresses...

961
00:59:57,018 --> 00:59:59,168
...polish her appearance and wheel her out.

962
00:59:59,257 --> 01:00:02,728
-I'd like to thank the Warren Commission.
-<i>Oswald was no angel.</i>

963
01:00:03,737 --> 01:00:05,170
But who was he?

964
01:00:05,338 --> 01:00:07,568
I'm lost. What are we saying?

965
01:00:08,858 --> 01:00:12,612
That when Oswald went to Russia,
he was not a real defector.

966
01:00:13,018 --> 01:00:17,648
He was an intelligence agent for our
government and remained one till he died.

967
01:00:18,737 --> 01:00:21,411
So, because Oswald pulled the trigger...

968
01:00:21,657 --> 01:00:24,695
...the intelligence community
murdered the President?

969
01:00:25,657 --> 01:00:28,012
I'll go you one better. Maybe Oswald...

970
01:00:28,097 --> 01:00:29,815
...didn't pull the trigger.

971
01:00:29,898 --> 01:00:33,413
Nitrate tests indicate he hadn't fired
a rifle on November 22.

972
01:00:33,737 --> 01:00:37,572
And they didn't bother to see
if the rifle'd been fired that day.

973
01:00:37,697 --> 01:00:40,735
-His palm print was on it.
-lt went to the FBI.

974
01:00:41,418 --> 01:00:43,612
FBI didn't find a goddamn thing.

975
01:00:43,777 --> 01:00:48,407
It comes back a week later and a Dallas
policeman suddenly finds a palm print?

976
01:00:48,938 --> 01:00:52,931
<i>It could've been taken at the morgue.</i>
<i>There's no chain of evidence.</i>

977
01:00:53,057 --> 01:00:56,494
I can't figure out why he orders
a traceable weapon...

978
01:00:57,378 --> 01:01:00,927
...to a P.O. box, when he can go
into any store in Texas...

979
01:01:01,097 --> 01:01:04,373
...give a phony name and walk out
with an untraceable rifle.

980
01:01:04,458 --> 01:01:06,369
To frame him, obviously!

981
01:01:06,498 --> 01:01:08,454
A lot of smoke, but some fire.

982
01:01:08,737 --> 01:01:10,329
We're talking about our government!

983
01:01:10,418 --> 01:01:12,568
We're talking about a crime.

984
01:01:13,217 --> 01:01:16,255
You must think on a different level,
like the CIA does.

985
01:01:16,938 --> 01:01:19,246
We're through the looking glass.

986
01:01:20,137 --> 01:01:21,365
White is black.

987
01:01:22,338 --> 01:01:24,056
And black is white.

988
01:01:24,737 --> 01:01:27,536
Maybe Oswald is just what he said he was.

989
01:01:27,898 --> 01:01:29,126
A patsy.

990
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:36,693
Unbelievable. You were here?

991
01:01:36,858 --> 01:01:39,246
Yes, this is where I was sitting.

992
01:01:39,617 --> 01:01:42,893
Shots came from near the wooden fence
over there...

993
01:01:44,097 --> 01:01:45,894
...near the overpass.

994
01:01:46,137 --> 01:01:49,766
I saw a man run from the fence
toward those railroad cars.

995
01:01:50,177 --> 01:01:52,737
I made it clear to the Warren people.

996
01:01:52,898 --> 01:01:55,809
One of the shots came
from behind that picket fence.

997
01:01:55,938 --> 01:01:59,931
I heard the report and saw smoke,
six or eight feet above the ground.

998
01:02:00,257 --> 01:02:02,168
<i>Out from under those trees.</i>

999
01:02:02,297 --> 01:02:04,527
<i>All four of us railroad men...</i>

1000
01:02:05,177 --> 01:02:07,088
<i>...seen the same thing.</i>

1001
01:02:07,458 --> 01:02:10,052
The smoke came from behind the hedge.

1002
01:02:10,137 --> 01:02:14,177
I was standing next to Mary Moorman,
who took the photo when he was killed.

1003
01:02:16,257 --> 01:02:18,532
I stepped down to the curb and yelled:

1004
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:21,126
"Mr. President, look over here!"

1005
01:02:23,177 --> 01:02:24,657
Then shots rang out.

1006
01:02:26,818 --> 01:02:30,936
<i>Mary dropped to the ground, yelling,</i>
<i>"They're shooting! Get down!"</i>

1007
01:02:32,697 --> 01:02:34,653
<i>I just stood there watching.</i>

1008
01:02:35,257 --> 01:02:37,168
<i>The driver had stopped.</i>

1009
01:02:37,858 --> 01:02:40,088
<i>I don't know what was wrong with him.</i>

1010
01:02:42,177 --> 01:02:44,248
Out of the corner of my eye...

1011
01:02:44,898 --> 01:02:47,458
...I saw a flash of light in the bushes.

1012
01:02:47,617 --> 01:02:49,130
<i>And that last shot...</i>

1013
01:02:50,338 --> 01:02:52,168
<i>...just ripped his head off.</i>

1014
01:02:53,057 --> 01:02:56,846
I looked up and saw smoke coming
from over there, on the knoll.

1015
01:02:57,217 --> 01:02:59,652
We came around to look for tracks.

1016
01:02:59,938 --> 01:03:02,815
<i>It rained that morning</i>
<i>and we found a bunch.</i>

1017
01:03:03,617 --> 01:03:05,210
Cigarette butts.

1018
01:03:05,297 --> 01:03:07,253
<i>Someone had stood about...here.</i>

1019
01:03:13,217 --> 01:03:14,650
That's a good spot.

1020
01:03:15,737 --> 01:03:17,329
For the head shot.

1021
01:03:18,657 --> 01:03:20,728
<i>Everything was just frozen.</i>

1022
01:03:21,378 --> 01:03:24,972
<i>Like people weren't breathing.</i>
<i>Like you were looking at a picture.</i>

1023
01:03:28,577 --> 01:03:30,170
<i>Except for one man.</i>

1024
01:03:30,818 --> 01:03:34,969
<i>I saw this one man running</i>
<i>from the corner of the Book Depository...</i>

1025
01:03:35,577 --> 01:03:37,135
<i>...to the parking lot.</i>

1026
01:03:37,217 --> 01:03:38,969
<i>It was about 11:00 a.m.</i>

1027
01:03:39,257 --> 01:03:42,728
I was driving on Elm Street
toward the underpass in a rented car.

1028
01:03:42,818 --> 01:03:44,489
<i>A light</i>-<i>blue Valiant.</i>

1029
01:03:44,898 --> 01:03:48,094
<i>I'll never forget that day.</i>
<i>There was a lot of traffic...</i>

1030
01:03:48,257 --> 01:03:50,976
<i>...and I stopped</i>
<i>alongside a green pickup truck.</i>

1031
01:03:51,297 --> 01:03:55,210
<i>It was very noticeable</i>
<i>because it had one wheel up on the curb.</i>

1032
01:03:55,577 --> 01:03:57,568
<i>When I saw the gun, I thought...</i>

1033
01:03:59,777 --> 01:04:02,246
<i>..."The Secret Service is not very secret."</i>

1034
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:05,215
<i>The next morning, I went to the FBI office.</i>

1035
01:04:05,378 --> 01:04:07,208
<i>They showed me some pictures.</i>

1036
01:04:07,297 --> 01:04:11,257
<i>And I picked out three pictures</i>
<i>that looked like the truck's driver.</i>

1037
01:04:11,458 --> 01:04:12,891
That's the man.

1038
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:15,652
<i>You mean you identified Jack Ruby</i>
<i>on Saturday?</i>

1039
01:04:15,858 --> 01:04:16,813
That's right.

1040
01:04:16,898 --> 01:04:18,411
The day before he shot Oswald?

1041
01:04:18,498 --> 01:04:21,773
That's right. When I saw him on TV,
I was shocked.

1042
01:04:22,177 --> 01:04:25,409
I said to my family,
"That's the man I saw in the truck."

1043
01:04:26,657 --> 01:04:29,695
You weren't so sure in your statement
to the Commission.

1044
01:04:29,898 --> 01:04:32,889
What about these others?
You said one might be him?

1045
01:04:33,858 --> 01:04:36,894
They look a bit like him,
but I'm sure this is the man.

1046
01:04:37,177 --> 01:04:39,567
It was him I chased up the grassy knoll.

1047
01:04:41,697 --> 01:04:44,894
<i>I thought maybe our guys had shot back</i>
<i>and got one of them.</i>

1048
01:04:45,498 --> 01:04:47,170
<i>I got to the parking lot.</i>

1049
01:04:48,378 --> 01:04:51,449
<i>All I saw were the railroad workers</i>
<i>and Dallas' finest.</i>

1050
01:04:52,577 --> 01:04:56,047
-Secret Service. Come with us.
-No! Find the shooter!

1051
01:04:56,898 --> 01:04:58,411
I want your pictures.

1052
01:04:59,097 --> 01:05:00,132
Son of a bitch!

1053
01:05:00,217 --> 01:05:02,173
<i>He put a hurt on me, but good.</i>

1054
01:05:02,818 --> 01:05:07,208
<i>They must've seen everything because</i>
<i>they knew what we had done all day.</i>

1055
01:05:07,458 --> 01:05:10,494
<i>I wasn't hard to find,</i>
<i>wearing that red raincoat.</i>

1056
01:05:10,657 --> 01:05:13,490
-How many shots did you hear?
-Four to six.

1057
01:05:14,297 --> 01:05:15,413
Impossible!

1058
01:05:16,577 --> 01:05:18,215
You heard echoes!

1059
01:05:20,097 --> 01:05:23,568
We have three bullets and three shots
that came from the Book Depository.

1060
01:05:23,657 --> 01:05:25,932
-That's all we'll say.
-No, sir.

1061
01:05:26,777 --> 01:05:31,090
I saw a man shooting from behind
that fence. What are you going to do?

1062
01:05:31,617 --> 01:05:34,610
-You go out there and get him!
-That's taken care of!

1063
01:05:34,777 --> 01:05:38,168
You only heard three shots,
and don't discuss this with anyone.

1064
01:05:38,818 --> 01:05:40,251
No one. Understand?

1065
01:05:40,538 --> 01:05:43,927
<i>Which is strange 'cause it's less</i>
<i>than 20 minutes after the assassination.</i>

1066
01:05:44,018 --> 01:05:45,132
Get her out of here.

1067
01:05:45,217 --> 01:05:48,369
<i>I knew something was crooked</i>
<i>as a dog's hind leg.</i>

1068
01:05:49,177 --> 01:05:52,295
When I read my testimony
in the Warren Report...

1069
01:05:52,697 --> 01:05:54,813
...it was a total fabrication.

1070
01:05:55,097 --> 01:05:59,250
That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison.
They've altered my statements.

1071
01:06:00,137 --> 01:06:01,617
This one says:

1072
01:06:01,818 --> 01:06:06,255
"Mercer couldn't identify any photograph
as being the man she observed...

1073
01:06:06,498 --> 01:06:09,456
"...slouched over the wheel
of the green truck." Not true.

1074
01:06:09,538 --> 01:06:12,052
I recognized him and I told them so.

1075
01:06:12,858 --> 01:06:14,132
Take your time.

1076
01:06:14,418 --> 01:06:15,407
I'm sure.

1077
01:06:15,498 --> 01:06:17,329
<i>And the sheriff's report....</i>

1078
01:06:17,538 --> 01:06:19,449
This is really strange.

1079
01:06:19,737 --> 01:06:21,932
See that notarized signature?

1080
01:06:22,338 --> 01:06:23,929
That's not mine.

1081
01:06:24,137 --> 01:06:27,574
There wasn't any notary present
during my questioning.

1082
01:06:29,057 --> 01:06:31,525
Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man...

1083
01:06:33,177 --> 01:06:35,293
...it's difficult to accept this.

1084
01:06:37,057 --> 01:06:38,934
Beverly, tell Mr. Garrison
about the Carousel Club.

1085
01:06:44,737 --> 01:06:49,016
I used to go there to see Jack
and my friend, Jatta, who danced there.

1086
01:06:49,217 --> 01:06:51,606
It was a real swinging spot in town.

1087
01:06:51,777 --> 01:06:53,052
Everybody came.

1088
01:06:53,338 --> 01:06:56,693
Businessmen, politicians from Austin,
LBJ's friends....

1089
01:06:57,057 --> 01:06:59,128
Dallas was a slowpokin' town then.

1090
01:06:59,297 --> 01:07:02,768
<i>You chewed toothpicks, played dominoes,</i>
<i>spit, dated policemen.</i>

1091
01:07:02,938 --> 01:07:06,248
<i>But Jack was exciting.</i>
<i>There were always cops there.</i>

1092
01:07:06,498 --> 01:07:10,251
<i>Jack liked them around, even though</i>
<i>he threw out the drunks himself.</i>

1093
01:07:10,617 --> 01:07:12,255
He had a violent temper.

1094
01:07:13,657 --> 01:07:16,775
<i>Everyone in those days</i>
<i>knew Jack was in the mob.</i>

1095
01:07:17,498 --> 01:07:19,728
<i>Cops back then, they were bad.</i>

1096
01:07:20,097 --> 01:07:22,976
<i>They'd shake you down</i>
<i>for the money in your pocket.</i>

1097
01:07:25,217 --> 01:07:26,731
<i>What about Lee?</i>

1098
01:07:28,057 --> 01:07:29,536
<i>One time I came in.</i>

1099
01:07:29,697 --> 01:07:33,929
<i>Jack introduced me to two guys.</i>
<i>He says, "This is my friend, Lee...."</i>

1100
01:07:35,938 --> 01:07:38,498
<i>I don't remember the other guy's name.</i>

1101
01:07:38,657 --> 01:07:42,014
But he was a weird-looking guy.
He had these eyebrows.

1102
01:07:42,498 --> 01:07:44,693
<i>And he looked like a buzzard.</i>

1103
01:07:46,697 --> 01:07:49,166
<i>Lee didn't make much of an impression.</i>

1104
01:07:50,137 --> 01:07:52,094
<i>He wasn't very handsome.</i>

1105
01:07:52,418 --> 01:07:55,807
<i>He didn't look like he had any money,</i>
<i>and he was in a bad mood.</i>

1106
01:07:55,898 --> 01:07:58,128
<i>So, I didn't pay him much mind.</i>

1107
01:07:59,737 --> 01:08:03,253
I may not remember a name,
but I always remember a face.

1108
01:08:04,538 --> 01:08:06,813
Later, when I saw him on television...

1109
01:08:08,217 --> 01:08:10,606
<i>...I screamed, "My God, that's him!"</i>

1110
01:08:10,978 --> 01:08:12,855
"That's Jack's friend!"

1111
01:08:14,137 --> 01:08:16,048
Will you testify, Beverly?

1112
01:08:18,297 --> 01:08:21,335
-I don't think so.
-I thought we had an agreement.

1113
01:08:24,577 --> 01:08:28,365
-I don't want to be another statistic.
-We could call you in.

1114
01:08:29,057 --> 01:08:32,493
If they can kill the President
of the United States...

1115
01:08:33,858 --> 01:08:37,930
...you think they'll think twice
about a two-bit showgirl like me?

1116
01:08:43,337 --> 01:08:45,646
I understand the pressure you're under.

1117
01:08:46,337 --> 01:08:48,248
Don't think that I don't.

1118
01:08:49,217 --> 01:08:50,570
We both do.

1119
01:08:56,578 --> 01:09:01,128
Mr. Chief Justice, do you understand
that I can't tell the truth in Dallas?

1120
01:09:02,658 --> 01:09:05,889
There are people here who do not want me
to tell the truth.

1121
01:09:06,018 --> 01:09:08,167
Who don't want me to have a retrial?

1122
01:09:08,698 --> 01:09:10,814
Why don't you just tell us now?

1123
01:09:11,137 --> 01:09:12,729
My life is in danger!

1124
01:09:13,057 --> 01:09:15,618
If you request that I go to Washington....

1125
01:09:15,778 --> 01:09:18,814
That is, if you want to hear
further testimony from me.

1126
01:09:18,938 --> 01:09:20,496
Can you take me with you?

1127
01:09:20,578 --> 01:09:22,329
No. It can't be done.

1128
01:09:22,818 --> 01:09:24,967
There would be no safe place for you.

1129
01:09:25,057 --> 01:09:27,525
We're not law-enforcement officers.

1130
01:09:28,257 --> 01:09:31,250
There's a great deal at stake in this matter.

1131
01:09:32,417 --> 01:09:34,170
If I'm eliminated...

1132
01:09:34,497 --> 01:09:39,127
...there won't be any way of knowing
any bit of truth pertaining to my situation.

1133
01:09:40,417 --> 01:09:44,171
Consequently, a whole new form
of government will take over.

1134
01:09:46,018 --> 01:09:48,895
And I won't live to see you
some other time.

1135
01:09:49,537 --> 01:09:51,210
<i>I want to tell the truth.</i>

1136
01:09:51,297 --> 01:09:52,412
<i>And then...</i>

1137
01:09:52,578 --> 01:09:54,170
<i>...leave this world.</i>

1138
01:09:56,417 --> 01:09:59,774
The Zapruder film establishes
three shots in 5.6 seconds.

1139
01:10:03,097 --> 01:10:04,372
I'm Oswald.

1140
01:10:05,337 --> 01:10:06,565
Time me.

1141
01:10:07,618 --> 01:10:08,653
Go.

1142
01:10:13,978 --> 01:10:14,932
Time?

1143
01:10:15,097 --> 01:10:16,610
Between six and seven seconds.

1144
01:10:16,698 --> 01:10:18,256
Without really aiming.

1145
01:10:18,337 --> 01:10:22,012
The second and third shots came
almost right on top of each other.

1146
01:10:22,337 --> 01:10:24,248
It takes a minimum of...

1147
01:10:24,417 --> 01:10:27,011
...2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.

1148
01:10:27,417 --> 01:10:29,851
The other problem is, there was a tree...

1149
01:10:30,018 --> 01:10:33,976
<i>...blocking the first two shots</i>
<i>when fired in the Zapruder film.</i>

1150
01:10:34,618 --> 01:10:38,132
Didn't Hoover say something
about leaves falling in November?

1151
01:10:38,297 --> 01:10:40,493
It was Texas live oak, Chief.

1152
01:10:40,898 --> 01:10:43,365
It sheds its leaves in early March.

1153
01:10:43,778 --> 01:10:47,054
Take this Carcano,
world's worst shoulder weapon...

1154
01:10:47,297 --> 01:10:51,449
...and try to hit a moving target
at 88 yards through heavy foliage.

1155
01:10:52,257 --> 01:10:53,452
No way.

1156
01:10:56,257 --> 01:10:58,408
FBI tried two sets of tests.

1157
01:10:58,618 --> 01:11:01,814
Not one sharpshooter could match
Oswald's performance.

1158
01:11:01,978 --> 01:11:03,206
Not one.

1159
01:11:03,417 --> 01:11:05,806
Oswald was at best a medium shot.

1160
01:11:06,297 --> 01:11:08,528
The scope was defective on it too.

1161
01:11:08,738 --> 01:11:11,570
This is the whole essence
of the case to me.

1162
01:11:11,778 --> 01:11:14,167
The guy couldn't do the shooting.

1163
01:11:14,658 --> 01:11:15,931
<i>Nobody could.</i>

1164
01:11:16,217 --> 01:11:18,731
They sold this lemon
to the American public.

1165
01:11:20,537 --> 01:11:23,449
The Zapruder film was the proof
they didn't count on.

1166
01:11:24,257 --> 01:11:26,010
We must get hold of it.

1167
01:11:27,297 --> 01:11:30,131
It means we'll have to subpoena Time-Life.

1168
01:11:31,417 --> 01:11:33,055
Let me ask you something.

1169
01:11:33,377 --> 01:11:35,653
Why not just shoot Kennedy on Houston?

1170
01:11:36,057 --> 01:11:37,570
Plenty of time.

1171
01:11:38,778 --> 01:11:41,735
-He's out in the open.
-I keep asking myself the same thing.

1172
01:11:41,818 --> 01:11:44,332
-Frontal shot.
-Even if you miss him once...

1173
01:11:44,537 --> 01:11:47,051
...if he accelerates, you get a second shot.

1174
01:11:47,137 --> 01:11:49,128
The only reason to get him on Elm...

1175
01:11:49,217 --> 01:11:52,210
...is you got him in a triangulated crossfire.

1176
01:11:53,018 --> 01:11:55,612
You put a team there down at the fence.

1177
01:11:55,778 --> 01:11:58,292
Frontal shot. Flat, low trajectory.

1178
01:11:58,818 --> 01:12:01,537
Put a third team down in this building...

1179
01:12:02,297 --> 01:12:03,492
...on a low floor.

1180
01:12:03,578 --> 01:12:06,649
When Kennedy gets in the kill zone,
it's a turkey shoot.

1181
01:12:09,337 --> 01:12:10,657
How many men?

1182
01:12:12,377 --> 01:12:15,893
One shooter. One spotter on a radio.
Maybe three teams.

1183
01:12:18,337 --> 01:12:21,454
These are professional riflemen.
Serious people.

1184
01:12:22,618 --> 01:12:23,733
Hunters.

1185
01:12:25,537 --> 01:12:26,765
Patient.

1186
01:12:28,698 --> 01:12:30,847
It takes skill to kill with a rifle.

1187
01:12:33,658 --> 01:12:37,810
That's why no chief executive's
been executed with one in 200 years.

1188
01:12:41,537 --> 01:12:42,527
<i>Three...</i>

1189
01:12:43,618 --> 01:12:44,653
...two...

1190
01:12:46,137 --> 01:12:47,092
...one.

1191
01:13:09,377 --> 01:13:11,766
Clay Bertrand? Sure, I know him.

1192
01:13:12,217 --> 01:13:13,697
Comes to the Quarter.

1193
01:13:13,778 --> 01:13:17,532
Who is he? I've been to all the bars.
Nobody wants to talk.

1194
01:13:18,658 --> 01:13:20,649
Why should they talk to you?

1195
01:13:21,738 --> 01:13:25,367
I told your uncle, I never met a lawman
who wasn't a punk.

1196
01:13:29,137 --> 01:13:32,095
A big-shot businessman.
I seen him on the TV news...

1197
01:13:32,377 --> 01:13:34,493
...with all the other big shots.

1198
01:13:34,658 --> 01:13:36,694
The guy's a fag, you know?

1199
01:13:37,097 --> 01:13:38,655
Goes by another name.

1200
01:13:38,818 --> 01:13:40,136
What name?

1201
01:13:40,818 --> 01:13:41,886
Shaw.

1202
01:13:42,018 --> 01:13:43,337
Clay Shaw.

1203
01:13:43,818 --> 01:13:45,569
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?

1204
01:13:46,337 --> 01:13:48,771
Guy who ran the International Trade Mart?

1205
01:13:49,137 --> 01:13:52,335
What's the mystery?
Everybody down here knows him.

1206
01:13:53,497 --> 01:13:55,853
Then why does he call himself Bertrand?

1207
01:13:56,177 --> 01:13:58,738
Who gives a shit what he calls himself?

1208
01:13:58,978 --> 01:14:02,493
Will you give us a little help
on that grand jury thing?

1209
01:14:02,818 --> 01:14:04,967
I hope so. We could use it.

1210
01:14:05,297 --> 01:14:06,935
<i>Your hunch was right, Boss.</i>

1211
01:14:07,018 --> 01:14:11,011
In January 1961, in New Orleans,
at the Bolton Ford dealership...

1212
01:14:11,778 --> 01:14:14,576
...when the Oswald we know is in Russia...

1213
01:14:14,658 --> 01:14:17,694
<i>...there is a man using the name of Oswald</i>
<i>to buy trucks...</i>

1214
01:14:17,778 --> 01:14:19,847
...for the Friends of Democratic Cuba.

1215
01:14:19,938 --> 01:14:22,690
$300 down, Mr. Oswald,
you can drive out with it.

1216
01:14:23,137 --> 01:14:25,253
Salesman never sees him again,
but guess who's...

1217
01:14:25,337 --> 01:14:29,251
...on the articles of incorporation
of the Friends of Democratic Cuba?

1218
01:14:30,337 --> 01:14:31,770
Guy Banister.

1219
01:14:32,938 --> 01:14:36,487
Banister has someone using
the name Oswald to buy the trucks.

1220
01:14:36,738 --> 01:14:39,935
Hoover at the FBI has a memo
dated June of 1960...

1221
01:14:40,778 --> 01:14:42,211
...that someone...

1222
01:14:42,297 --> 01:14:45,335
<i>...may be using Oswald's passport</i>
<i>and identity.</i>

1223
01:14:45,457 --> 01:14:48,734
Other witnesses see him
at different firing ranges.

1224
01:14:49,818 --> 01:14:51,694
<i>One time, November 9...</i>

1225
01:14:51,778 --> 01:14:54,850
<i>...he decides to practice</i>
<i>on the next guy's target.</i>

1226
01:14:54,938 --> 01:14:58,408
I didn't pay for a target
just to have you shoot at it!

1227
01:14:59,778 --> 01:15:01,609
Hey, I'm sorry, buddy.

1228
01:15:03,057 --> 01:15:06,333
I thought I was shooting
at that son of a bitch Kennedy.

1229
01:15:06,698 --> 01:15:09,689
As subtle as a cockroach
crawling across a white rug.

1230
01:15:09,778 --> 01:15:12,132
Then he shows up at Sylvia Odio's...

1231
01:15:12,217 --> 01:15:15,688
<i>...a Cuban lady in Dallas</i>
<i>in the anti</i>-<i>Castro underground.</i>

1232
01:15:15,858 --> 01:15:18,735
<i>The two Cubans introduce him</i>
<i>as Leon Oswald.</i>

1233
01:15:20,578 --> 01:15:22,569
<i>But the Warren Commission</i>
<i>says that Sylvia...</i>

1234
01:15:22,658 --> 01:15:26,172
...has bad eyesight because
they have Oswald in Mexico...

1235
01:15:26,658 --> 01:15:28,966
...trying to get back into Cuba.

1236
01:15:29,778 --> 01:15:32,814
<i>The CIA has a camera</i>
<i>outside the Cuban Embassy.</i>

1237
01:15:33,057 --> 01:15:34,935
<i>And they say that this...</i>

1238
01:15:35,818 --> 01:15:37,729
...is Oswald in Mexico.

1239
01:15:39,177 --> 01:15:42,090
If this is Oswald,
it must be our third Oswald.

1240
01:15:42,618 --> 01:15:46,610
The Warren Commission made great efforts
to make him a Communist.

1241
01:15:46,938 --> 01:15:51,533
I think the point of the Mexican episode
was to lay the blame on Fidel Castro.

1242
01:15:53,057 --> 01:15:55,525
If Oswald, or someone purporting
to be Oswald...

1243
01:15:55,618 --> 01:15:59,292
...had gotten into Cuba, come back,
and then killed the President...

1244
01:16:00,177 --> 01:16:03,250
...the American public would've supported
a Cuban invasion.

1245
01:16:03,337 --> 01:16:06,011
I even have doubts about this photo, Boss.

1246
01:16:06,457 --> 01:16:09,336
This convicted Oswald in the public's mind.

1247
01:16:09,497 --> 01:16:12,934
But Oswald told Capt. Fritz
that the photo was a fake.

1248
01:16:13,658 --> 01:16:15,011
This is not me!

1249
01:16:15,097 --> 01:16:18,568
-That came from Janet Williams' garage.
-I never saw this picture.

1250
01:16:18,658 --> 01:16:22,127
It's my face but it's superimposed.
The rest is not me.

1251
01:16:23,018 --> 01:16:26,693
I know photographic work.
That picture was made by someone else!

1252
01:16:26,858 --> 01:16:28,927
I took this picture to two experts.

1253
01:16:29,377 --> 01:16:31,448
Look at how the shadows on the nose...

1254
01:16:31,537 --> 01:16:34,051
...fall in a straight line, like it's high noon.

1255
01:16:34,137 --> 01:16:37,813
But the shadow on the ground reads more
like late afternoon or early morning.

1256
01:16:37,898 --> 01:16:39,377
It's not the same time.

1257
01:16:39,457 --> 01:16:41,733
And see the crop marks across the chin?

1258
01:16:41,818 --> 01:16:44,457
This head is pasted onto another body.

1259
01:16:44,978 --> 01:16:47,445
Implicating him with the rifle and the gun.

1260
01:16:47,537 --> 01:16:50,609
Who the hell are you?
Alex Hidell or Lee Oswald?

1261
01:16:54,137 --> 01:16:56,412
You're the policeman, you work it out.

1262
01:16:56,698 --> 01:16:59,006
They created Oswald from day one.

1263
01:16:59,137 --> 01:17:03,416
Like a dummy corporation in the Bahamas.
Just move him around a board.

1264
01:17:03,618 --> 01:17:05,210
Anybody want to quit?

1265
01:17:07,457 --> 01:17:09,608
Dumb question. Put your hands down.

1266
01:17:11,698 --> 01:17:13,529
I found Clay Bertrand.

1267
01:17:14,257 --> 01:17:16,692
Grab your socks and hose and pull.

1268
01:17:16,858 --> 01:17:18,769
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw.

1269
01:17:19,698 --> 01:17:22,689
-Director of the Trade Mart?
-Former director.

1270
01:17:22,938 --> 01:17:24,052
Incredible.

1271
01:17:24,137 --> 01:17:26,207
Can you get some sworn statements?

1272
01:17:26,578 --> 01:17:29,091
That'll be tough. Nobody's talking.

1273
01:17:30,257 --> 01:17:32,088
Let's have him in for a chat.

1274
01:17:32,257 --> 01:17:34,488
I hate to get him dragged into this.

1275
01:17:34,658 --> 01:17:37,774
He's done so much for the city,
restoring the Quarter.

1276
01:17:38,018 --> 01:17:41,851
Remember, we saw him at a fund-raiser.
Seems like such a nice man.

1277
01:17:42,097 --> 01:17:45,568
It'll be off the record.
I'll bring him in on a Sunday.

1278
01:17:47,377 --> 01:17:49,686
A quiet little chat between gentlemen.

1279
01:18:05,618 --> 01:18:07,369
<i>In heavy fighting in Vietnam today...</i>

1280
01:18:07,457 --> 01:18:10,574
<i>...seven more American soldiers died</i>
<i>and 23 were wounded.</i>

1281
01:18:10,658 --> 01:18:13,694
<i>The body count for this week</i>
<i>now stands at 6</i>7 <i>Americans...</i>

1282
01:18:13,778 --> 01:18:16,655
<i>...and 626 enemy soldiers killed in action.</i>

1283
01:18:17,057 --> 01:18:21,289
<i>President Johnson said he regretted</i>
<i>there's no end in sight to the war...</i>

1284
01:18:21,457 --> 01:18:24,018
<i>...where 500,000 US troops</i>
<i>are now fighting.</i>

1285
01:18:24,177 --> 01:18:25,930
<i>We face more cost...</i>

1286
01:18:26,457 --> 01:18:27,731
<i>...more loss...</i>

1287
01:18:28,297 --> 01:18:29,650
<i>...and more agony.</i>

1288
01:18:29,738 --> 01:18:31,729
Come hunt for Easter eggs.

1289
01:18:32,217 --> 01:18:36,734
That's the kids' job. You know I don't like
these tribal rituals, anyway.

1290
01:18:37,018 --> 01:18:39,327
I'm talking to Clay Shaw this morning.

1291
01:18:39,497 --> 01:18:42,136
We're going to Antoine's with the kids!

1292
01:18:42,297 --> 01:18:44,368
I told you I was talking to Shaw.

1293
01:18:44,457 --> 01:18:46,733
In the middle of Easter Sunday?

1294
01:18:46,938 --> 01:18:49,735
When I scheduled it,
I didn't know it was a holiday.

1295
01:18:49,818 --> 01:18:51,614
Look at the calendar!

1296
01:18:51,818 --> 01:18:54,047
You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.

1297
01:18:54,537 --> 01:18:56,210
Clay Shaw is important.

1298
01:18:56,457 --> 01:18:58,891
-And we're not.
-I didn't say that.

1299
01:18:59,578 --> 01:19:01,170
I didn't say that.

1300
01:19:01,978 --> 01:19:05,095
You're missing most of your life
and you don't know it.

1301
01:19:05,257 --> 01:19:07,248
The kids are missing out, too.

1302
01:19:07,818 --> 01:19:12,015
-You're not the only one making sacrifices.
-I'll be there by 2:00, I promise.

1303
01:19:12,698 --> 01:19:14,336
Just start without me.

1304
01:19:23,658 --> 01:19:26,536
Mr. Garrison, what can I do for you
on Easter Sunday?

1305
01:19:26,618 --> 01:19:28,688
I'm sorry to interrupt this holiday.

1306
01:19:28,778 --> 01:19:33,090
But this conversation is best kept out
of the everyday bustle of this office.

1307
01:19:33,257 --> 01:19:34,690
I don't understand.

1308
01:19:34,858 --> 01:19:38,817
In an investigation we're conducting,
your name keeps coming up.

1309
01:19:39,018 --> 01:19:40,371
Can't imagine where.

1310
01:19:40,457 --> 01:19:43,894
We've talked to a number of men
who claim to know you.

1311
01:19:44,297 --> 01:19:46,128
Do you know a David Logan?

1312
01:19:46,297 --> 01:19:48,208
No. Never heard of him.

1313
01:19:48,938 --> 01:19:50,087
Perry Russo?

1314
01:19:50,177 --> 01:19:51,132
No.

1315
01:19:52,057 --> 01:19:53,570
Willie O'Keefe?

1316
01:19:54,938 --> 01:19:57,327
I don't know anyone by that name.

1317
01:19:57,578 --> 01:20:01,650
Mr. O'Keefe told us he met you
at the Masquerade Bar in the Quarter.

1318
01:20:02,137 --> 01:20:05,971
<i>Then you had him over for dinner</i>
<i>at your apartment on Dauphine Street.</i>

1319
01:20:06,177 --> 01:20:08,896
-<i>Do you recall that?</i>
-<i>I don't know this man.</i>

1320
01:20:09,898 --> 01:20:11,331
Be still my heart.

1321
01:20:11,578 --> 01:20:14,046
Obviously, I wouldn't have him over.

1322
01:20:14,217 --> 01:20:15,775
Hope you like squab.

1323
01:20:17,497 --> 01:20:18,817
Champagne?

1324
01:20:19,257 --> 01:20:23,536
<i>Perhaps a few more details about</i>
<i>the evening will refresh your memory.</i>

1325
01:20:29,417 --> 01:20:33,969
<i>Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served</i>
<i>by a uniformed waiter, a colored man.</i>

1326
01:20:34,457 --> 01:20:38,451
You sat at one end and he at the other,
which he found unusual...

1327
01:20:39,177 --> 01:20:41,247
<i>...because the table was so long.</i>

1328
01:20:41,738 --> 01:20:43,091
How was your mousse?

1329
01:20:43,177 --> 01:20:45,247
Bring back memories of Willie O'Keefe?

1330
01:20:45,337 --> 01:20:46,565
Not at all.

1331
01:20:47,257 --> 01:20:48,850
But I do have...

1332
01:20:49,097 --> 01:20:51,407
<i>...a lovely Chippendale dining table.</i>

1333
01:20:51,658 --> 01:20:55,127
I often have a friend sit at one end
while I sit at the other.

1334
01:20:55,257 --> 01:20:58,375
It's precisely the point
of a long dining table.

1335
01:20:59,018 --> 01:21:01,737
The splendor of the meal
adds to its enjoyment.

1336
01:21:01,978 --> 01:21:04,047
I imagine a uniformed waiter helps.

1337
01:21:04,217 --> 01:21:06,448
It adds elegance, for which I confess...

1338
01:21:06,537 --> 01:21:08,448
<i>...a weakness now and then.</i>

1339
01:21:08,698 --> 01:21:10,131
<i>I call him Smedley.</i>

1340
01:21:11,097 --> 01:21:15,329
His real name's Frankie Jenkins,
but it would be so uncouth during dinner...

1341
01:21:15,497 --> 01:21:17,806
<i>...to turn toward the kitchen and holler...</i>

1342
01:21:17,898 --> 01:21:19,331
..."Frankie!"

1343
01:21:24,377 --> 01:21:26,448
Where is all this leading to?

1344
01:21:26,698 --> 01:21:29,006
After dinner, you paid him to have sex.

1345
01:21:32,217 --> 01:21:34,208
That is absolute nonsense.

1346
01:21:34,858 --> 01:21:38,850
The Quarter is filled
with vivid imaginations, dear Mr. Garrison.

1347
01:21:39,297 --> 01:21:42,448
Grimy young hoodlums who will say
and do anything!

1348
01:21:42,618 --> 01:21:44,369
Mr. O'Keefe told us...

1349
01:21:44,537 --> 01:21:47,689
<i>...David Ferrie came to the house</i>
<i>with another young man.</i>

1350
01:21:49,497 --> 01:21:51,216
-<i>Who?</i>
-<i>David Ferrie.</i>

1351
01:21:52,457 --> 01:21:54,130
I don't know that name.

1352
01:21:54,537 --> 01:21:58,052
<i>Never having met Mr. O'Keefe,</i>
<i>I couldn't have met Mr. Ferrie.</i>

1353
01:22:11,097 --> 01:22:12,530
You're mine, Mary.

1354
01:22:13,417 --> 01:22:16,296
The four of you partied early
into the morning hours.

1355
01:22:16,377 --> 01:22:17,970
Look at this picture.

1356
01:22:18,858 --> 01:22:21,735
I've never met anyone
of such bizarre appearance.

1357
01:22:29,898 --> 01:22:33,810
Only way you get this,
you do exactly what I say. I'm the man.

1358
01:22:35,738 --> 01:22:37,854
You know the name Clay Bertrand?

1359
01:22:37,978 --> 01:22:39,457
Clay Bertrand.

1360
01:22:40,057 --> 01:22:43,653
A man with a similar name worked
at the Chamber of Commerce.

1361
01:22:43,818 --> 01:22:46,537
-That the man you had in mind?
-No, it was not.

1362
01:22:47,337 --> 01:22:49,373
Can you identify this man?

1363
01:22:49,898 --> 01:22:53,493
Naturally. You claim Mr. Oswald
also had dinner with me?

1364
01:22:53,978 --> 01:22:56,492
Have you ever met Lee Harvey Oswald?

1365
01:22:56,938 --> 01:23:00,453
You have me consorting with a sordid cast
of characters.

1366
01:23:00,618 --> 01:23:03,177
-Please answer the question.
-'Course not.

1367
01:23:03,658 --> 01:23:06,456
The assassination was such a pity.
In fact...

1368
01:23:06,658 --> 01:23:09,091
...I admired Kennedy. Man of true panache.

1369
01:23:09,177 --> 01:23:10,930
Wife of impeccable taste.

1370
01:23:11,337 --> 01:23:14,329
Let's order without your daddy.
He won't mind.

1371
01:23:14,778 --> 01:23:16,449
I want a Shirley Temple!

1372
01:23:16,618 --> 01:23:18,847
Kids, put your water guns away.

1373
01:23:19,257 --> 01:23:20,770
When's Daddy coming?

1374
01:23:21,738 --> 01:23:23,251
He's coming soon.

1375
01:23:23,497 --> 01:23:26,694
He's sorry he's late,
but he promised he'd be here.

1376
01:23:26,858 --> 01:23:29,132
Daddy never keeps his promises.

1377
01:23:33,337 --> 01:23:35,898
This ltalian newspaper article says...

1378
01:23:36,057 --> 01:23:39,891
...you were a board member
of <i>Centro Mondo Commerciale</i> in ltaly.

1379
01:23:40,257 --> 01:23:44,251
This company was created by the CIA
for the transfer of funds in ltaly...

1380
01:23:44,457 --> 01:23:47,096
...for illegal political-espionage activities.

1381
01:23:47,177 --> 01:23:51,251
Says that this company was expelled
from ltaly for those activities.

1382
01:23:51,497 --> 01:23:53,613
I'm well aware of that asinine article.

1383
01:23:53,698 --> 01:23:55,847
I'm thinking of suing that rag.

1384
01:23:56,097 --> 01:23:59,533
It also says this company is linked
to the Schlumberger Tool Company...

1385
01:23:59,618 --> 01:24:02,927
...in Louisiana, which provided arms
to David Ferrie and his Cubans.

1386
01:24:03,018 --> 01:24:04,530
You're reaching.

1387
01:24:04,618 --> 01:24:05,573
Am I?

1388
01:24:05,738 --> 01:24:09,173
I'm an international businessman.
The Trade Mart I founded...

1389
01:24:09,337 --> 01:24:13,854
...is America's commercial pipeline
to Latin America. I trade everywhere.

1390
01:24:14,457 --> 01:24:17,211
Like all businessmen,
I am accused of all things.

1391
01:24:17,738 --> 01:24:21,810
I go about my business, make money,
help society the best I can...

1392
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:24,697
...and try to promote free trade
in this world.

1393
01:24:25,658 --> 01:24:28,774
Have you ever been a contract agent
for the CIA?

1394
01:24:33,177 --> 01:24:34,690
And if I were...

1395
01:24:35,497 --> 01:24:38,331
...do you believe I would be here today...

1396
01:24:39,658 --> 01:24:41,807
...talking to somebody like you?

1397
01:24:47,097 --> 01:24:49,737
-People like you don't have to.
-May I go?

1398
01:24:49,898 --> 01:24:52,730
People like you walk
between the raindrops.

1399
01:24:53,578 --> 01:24:54,851
May I go?

1400
01:24:56,858 --> 01:24:57,926
Yes.

1401
01:25:05,818 --> 01:25:10,333
Regardless of what you may think of me,
I am a patriot first and foremost.

1402
01:25:10,698 --> 01:25:13,006
I've spent half my life in the military...

1403
01:25:13,097 --> 01:25:14,770
...defending my country.

1404
01:25:14,938 --> 01:25:19,250
You're the first person I've met who
considers it patriotic to kill the President.

1405
01:25:19,337 --> 01:25:21,293
You are way out of line.

1406
01:25:21,578 --> 01:25:24,774
It's getting late.
That's all the questions we have.

1407
01:25:24,938 --> 01:25:27,497
Thank you for your honesty
and for coming in.

1408
01:25:27,658 --> 01:25:29,409
I enjoyed meeting with you.

1409
01:25:30,457 --> 01:25:33,291
And you, Miss Cox.
It's been most pleasant.

1410
01:25:38,537 --> 01:25:42,689
I extend to you and your families
my best wishes for a happy Easter.

1411
01:25:51,177 --> 01:25:54,055
"One may smile, and smile
and be a villain."

1412
01:25:55,417 --> 01:25:57,648
Goddamn it! We've got one of them.

1413
01:25:57,818 --> 01:25:58,853
See that?

1414
01:26:15,097 --> 01:26:16,372
-Hi, honey.
-Hi.

1415
01:26:20,938 --> 01:26:22,212
Tough day.

1416
01:26:22,377 --> 01:26:23,890
Where you been?

1417
01:26:24,698 --> 01:26:26,131
My sympathies.

1418
01:26:26,377 --> 01:26:29,734
I'm sorry, the meeting took much longer
than expected.

1419
01:26:29,898 --> 01:26:31,331
Just a second.

1420
01:26:31,497 --> 01:26:33,488
We waited for hours, Jim!

1421
01:26:35,497 --> 01:26:37,408
You could've telephoned.

1422
01:26:37,578 --> 01:26:41,490
I can only say I'm sorry.
I just don't have rabbits on my mind.

1423
01:26:42,698 --> 01:26:44,211
You know what I think?

1424
01:26:44,377 --> 01:26:47,734
You care more about John Kennedy
than your own family.

1425
01:26:47,898 --> 01:26:51,810
All day the kids asked, "Where's Daddy?"
What should I tell them?

1426
01:26:52,537 --> 01:26:53,970
I don't know!

1427
01:26:54,177 --> 01:26:57,250
The truth! I'm doing my job
to make sure they grow up...

1428
01:26:57,337 --> 01:27:01,171
...in a country where justice won't be
a vanished idea in history books...

1429
01:27:01,257 --> 01:27:03,328
...like dinosaurs or Atlantis.

1430
01:27:03,457 --> 01:27:06,256
It doesn't replace a husband
or a father on Easter Sunday.

1431
01:27:06,337 --> 01:27:08,293
It's going to get worse!

1432
01:27:13,775 --> 01:27:15,766
I beat you again, you must give me a raise.

1433
01:27:15,855 --> 01:27:17,608
Who can you brag to?

1434
01:27:20,256 --> 01:27:23,532
Who killed President Kennedy?
Was there a conspiracy here?

1435
01:27:23,695 --> 01:27:26,005
I don't know what you're talking about.

1436
01:27:26,815 --> 01:27:29,250
Clear the door! Watch out! Move!

1437
01:27:31,775 --> 01:27:33,926
Congratulations. You're Page One.

1438
01:27:34,496 --> 01:27:35,770
Ain't pretty. It says...

1439
01:27:35,855 --> 01:27:39,530
...we've spent over $8,000
on unexplained investigative expenses...

1440
01:27:39,695 --> 01:27:41,333
...since November, 1966.

1441
01:27:41,576 --> 01:27:42,372
Goddamn!

1442
01:27:42,456 --> 01:27:43,524
Shaw got them on our tail.

1443
01:27:43,615 --> 01:27:45,447
<i>...has raised some interesting questions.</i>

1444
01:27:45,536 --> 01:27:49,131
<i>With taxpayer money, has he uncovered</i>
<i>valuable new evidence?</i>

1445
01:27:49,296 --> 01:27:53,891
<i>Or is he merely saving the information</i>
<i>to gain exposure at a national level?</i>

1446
01:27:54,336 --> 01:27:57,134
<i>Mr. Garrison should have</i>
<i>some explanation.</i>

1447
01:27:57,296 --> 01:27:59,445
<i>Did your office plant that garbage</i>
<i>in the paper?</i>

1448
01:27:59,536 --> 01:28:01,527
-Who is this?
-<i>You know damn well.</i>

1449
01:28:01,615 --> 01:28:03,527
-Dave?
-<i>You got it. Listen.</i>

1450
01:28:03,695 --> 01:28:05,765
<i>You're the only straight</i>-<i>shooter there.</i>

1451
01:28:05,855 --> 01:28:07,846
I want an answer! Did you plant it?

1452
01:28:07,935 --> 01:28:11,405
<i>Do you think we're nuts?</i>
<i>It's been a zoo since that broke.</i>

1453
01:28:11,576 --> 01:28:13,645
<i>Reporters everywhere.</i>
<i>Do you think we want that?</i>

1454
01:28:13,735 --> 01:28:16,250
Somebody planted that fucking story!

1455
01:28:16,496 --> 01:28:20,011
I'm one of fucking Garrison's suspects.
I can't go home!

1456
01:28:20,176 --> 01:28:23,212
<i>The maggots are everywhere!</i>
<i>Do you know what you've done to me?</i>

1457
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:24,569
Calm down.

1458
01:28:24,735 --> 01:28:25,770
<i>From here on...</i>

1459
01:28:25,855 --> 01:28:27,846
...l'm a fucking dead man!

1460
01:28:28,015 --> 01:28:30,769
<i>You weren't even mentioned in the story.</i>

1461
01:28:31,296 --> 01:28:34,447
Meet me in the lobby
of the Fontainebleau in 20 minutes.

1462
01:28:34,855 --> 01:28:39,167
<i>I guarantee the boss will protect you.</i>
<i>He likes you. He likes your mind.</i>

1463
01:28:44,015 --> 01:28:46,291
I just don't know who to trust anymore.

1464
01:28:46,376 --> 01:28:50,528
I suppose I could use a pot of hot coffee
and a few packs of Luckys.

1465
01:28:51,815 --> 01:28:53,010
Anything new?

1466
01:28:53,416 --> 01:28:55,212
Who are you scared of?

1467
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:57,810
Everybody. The Agency, mob, Cubans.

1468
01:28:59,055 --> 01:29:00,648
Follow the Cubans.

1469
01:29:00,815 --> 01:29:03,649
Check them out. Here. In Miami. Dallas.

1470
01:29:04,655 --> 01:29:06,725
Check out Eladio del Valle.

1471
01:29:07,055 --> 01:29:10,252
He was my paymaster
when I flew missions into Cuba.

1472
01:29:10,576 --> 01:29:13,726
You're on the right track.
Don't write this down!

1473
01:29:14,416 --> 01:29:16,645
I ain't cooperating with no one!

1474
01:29:17,095 --> 01:29:20,007
There's a death warrant for me!
Don't you get it?

1475
01:29:20,296 --> 01:29:22,092
Damn! Wait a minute!

1476
01:29:22,176 --> 01:29:24,929
You ain't bugged, are you?
Son of a bitch, Lou!

1477
01:29:25,296 --> 01:29:26,364
Are you?

1478
01:29:26,695 --> 01:29:28,333
I play square. No bugs.

1479
01:29:28,615 --> 01:29:32,051
I'd love you to go on the record,
but I'm in no hurry.

1480
01:29:32,456 --> 01:29:34,492
I haven't slept since that article.

1481
01:29:34,576 --> 01:29:38,409
-Why'd you get me involved?
-Did we involve you? Or did Shaw?

1482
01:29:39,015 --> 01:29:41,849
Cocksucking faggot.
He got me by the balls.

1483
01:29:42,095 --> 01:29:45,007
-What do you mean?
-Photographs, compromising stuff.

1484
01:29:45,416 --> 01:29:46,769
He'll use them, too.

1485
01:29:46,855 --> 01:29:48,448
Agency plays for keeps.

1486
01:29:48,615 --> 01:29:52,164
Oswald was in my Civil Air Patrol unit.
I taught him everything.

1487
01:29:52,336 --> 01:29:55,692
He was a wannabe. No one liked him.
Thought he was a snitch.

1488
01:29:56,296 --> 01:29:57,854
But I treated him good.

1489
01:29:57,935 --> 01:30:00,769
He wanted his kid to grow up
with a chance.

1490
01:30:01,095 --> 01:30:03,166
What's this? What's going on?

1491
01:30:04,975 --> 01:30:06,375
Don't let him in.

1492
01:30:06,536 --> 01:30:08,287
No one's coming in here.

1493
01:30:11,176 --> 01:30:12,734
Black. Give it to me.

1494
01:30:12,815 --> 01:30:15,046
Black. My neck is killing me.

1495
01:30:16,136 --> 01:30:20,128
I've had cancer for years.
Been working with mice to find a cure.

1496
01:30:20,975 --> 01:30:22,648
Did you work for the CIA?

1497
01:30:22,855 --> 01:30:26,371
You sound like it's a remote experience
in ancient history.

1498
01:30:26,536 --> 01:30:28,287
You don't leave the Agency.

1499
01:30:29,296 --> 01:30:32,332
-Once you're in, they got you for life.
-And Shaw?

1500
01:30:32,775 --> 01:30:35,369
Shaw's an untouchable. Highest clearance.

1501
01:30:35,655 --> 01:30:38,250
Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans, all Agency.

1502
01:30:39,655 --> 01:30:40,532
Ruby?

1503
01:30:44,456 --> 01:30:47,208
Jack was a pimp.
A bagman for the Dallas mob.

1504
01:30:47,536 --> 01:30:50,003
Ran guns to Castro
when he was on our side.

1505
01:30:50,216 --> 01:30:52,889
Castro was almost with us
till we tried to whack him.

1506
01:30:52,975 --> 01:30:54,773
Everybody keeps flipping sides.

1507
01:30:54,855 --> 01:30:56,573
It's fun and games.

1508
01:30:56,775 --> 01:31:00,006
-How do the mob figure in this?
-They're Agency too.

1509
01:31:00,176 --> 01:31:04,488
The CIA and the Mafia worked together
for years trying to whack out the beard.

1510
01:31:04,655 --> 01:31:07,216
There's more to this than you could dream!

1511
01:31:08,136 --> 01:31:11,252
Check out something called
"Operation Mongoose."

1512
01:31:11,536 --> 01:31:14,528
Government, Pentagon stuff.
They're in charge.

1513
01:31:15,015 --> 01:31:17,609
But who pulls whose chain? Who knows?

1514
01:31:18,376 --> 01:31:21,333
"Oh, what a deadly web we weave
when we practice to deceive."

1515
01:31:21,416 --> 01:31:22,929
Who killed the President?

1516
01:31:23,015 --> 01:31:25,609
Why don't you fucking stop it? Shit!

1517
01:31:26,855 --> 01:31:29,529
This is too big for you, you know that?

1518
01:31:30,055 --> 01:31:33,014
Who did the President? Fuck!
It's a mystery.

1519
01:31:33,935 --> 01:31:36,847
It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle
inside an enigma!

1520
01:31:36,935 --> 01:31:39,814
The shooters don't even know!
Don't you get it?

1521
01:31:39,975 --> 01:31:42,729
Fuck, man! I can't keep talking like this!

1522
01:31:42,895 --> 01:31:44,806
They'll fucking kill me!

1523
01:31:44,975 --> 01:31:46,613
I'll fucking die!

1524
01:31:50,695 --> 01:31:51,970
Son of a bitch!

1525
01:31:52,216 --> 01:31:53,694
It's all right.

1526
01:31:55,496 --> 01:31:57,452
I don't know what happened.

1527
01:31:57,895 --> 01:31:59,011
Fuck!

1528
01:32:05,416 --> 01:32:07,565
All I wanted in the world...

1529
01:32:09,735 --> 01:32:11,805
...was to be a Catholic priest.

1530
01:32:12,935 --> 01:32:14,528
Live in a monastery.

1531
01:32:14,695 --> 01:32:16,015
Pray. Serve God.

1532
01:32:17,456 --> 01:32:18,570
I had...

1533
01:32:20,975 --> 01:32:23,364
...one terrible fucking weakness.

1534
01:32:24,176 --> 01:32:25,894
And they defrocked me!

1535
01:32:29,935 --> 01:32:32,291
Then I started to lose everything.

1536
01:32:33,775 --> 01:32:35,573
You'll be okay, Dave.

1537
01:32:36,176 --> 01:32:39,134
Just talk to us on the record.
We'll protect you.

1538
01:32:45,136 --> 01:32:46,854
They'll get to you too.

1539
01:32:48,015 --> 01:32:49,573
They'll destroy you.

1540
01:32:51,336 --> 01:32:52,814
They're untouchable.

1541
01:32:56,296 --> 01:32:59,332
I'm so fucking exhausted,
I can't see straight.

1542
01:33:13,456 --> 01:33:15,412
Early for Mardi Gras, isn't it?

1543
01:33:15,496 --> 01:33:18,055
<i>Paris Match</i>, the largest magazine
in France.

1544
01:33:18,216 --> 01:33:20,365
<i>Literaturnaya Gazeta</i> from Moscow.

1545
01:33:20,775 --> 01:33:22,653
Victoria Taylor, <i>Private Eye</i>.

1546
01:33:24,015 --> 01:33:26,769
You know who shot the President?
Mr. Garrison is too busy....

1547
01:33:26,855 --> 01:33:29,654
They're putting the heat on David Ferrie.

1548
01:33:29,975 --> 01:33:31,886
If we wait, he won't hold on.

1549
01:33:34,256 --> 01:33:38,168
He keeps changing his story.
We can't call him to a grand jury.

1550
01:33:39,176 --> 01:33:43,293
He'll keep deteriorating.
We'll get more out of him when he cracks.

1551
01:33:44,176 --> 01:33:47,725
If we call him in now he might freeze up,
we'll lose our best shot.

1552
01:33:47,815 --> 01:33:51,331
He can't go down any further.
We must protect him full time.

1553
01:33:53,136 --> 01:33:55,695
I know what you're going through
with Ferrie.

1554
01:33:55,855 --> 01:33:59,530
We'll talk tomorrow.
I have to catch a plane to Washington.

1555
01:34:01,775 --> 01:34:05,051
A lead says he's closely connected
to these events...

1556
01:34:05,496 --> 01:34:06,975
...but he won't come here.

1557
01:34:07,055 --> 01:34:10,047
I'm onto Ferrie's Cuban paymaster,
Eladio del Valle.

1558
01:34:10,256 --> 01:34:12,895
I need more men. I got to get him in.

1559
01:34:13,136 --> 01:34:16,332
I can't pull the teams to watch Ferrie.
I promised him!

1560
01:34:16,496 --> 01:34:18,134
This is our case!

1561
01:34:21,256 --> 01:34:23,167
I got something to show you.

1562
01:34:23,336 --> 01:34:25,804
I think you'll find it interesting.

1563
01:34:28,615 --> 01:34:30,287
This was found in your office.

1564
01:34:30,376 --> 01:34:35,006
The conference room is bugged, maybe
the phones. We have to debug the place.

1565
01:34:35,176 --> 01:34:38,054
Bugging the DA's office.
This is outrageous!

1566
01:34:38,376 --> 01:34:41,048
Believe what you want,
but we must be more careful.

1567
01:34:41,136 --> 01:34:43,127
All these new volunteers!

1568
01:34:44,336 --> 01:34:47,930
You handle it, okay?
I don't have time for this nonsense.

1569
01:34:50,095 --> 01:34:53,212
Well, we obviously got
the bastards worried now.

1570
01:34:56,015 --> 01:34:58,006
I'm coming to Washington!

1571
01:35:03,336 --> 01:35:05,054
Dave Ferrie's dead.

1572
01:35:05,615 --> 01:35:08,608
Found his body in his apartment
two hours ago.

1573
01:35:32,496 --> 01:35:33,814
What's it look like?

1574
01:35:33,895 --> 01:35:38,412
I don't see any violence. Heart attack,
maybe an aneurysm. Natural causes.

1575
01:35:38,576 --> 01:35:41,295
This is addressed to no one
and no signature.

1576
01:35:41,576 --> 01:35:44,328
"To leave this life is
for me a sweet prospect.

1577
01:35:44,496 --> 01:35:46,770
"I find nothing in it that is desirable...

1578
01:35:46,855 --> 01:35:49,972
"...and, on the other hand,
everything that is loathsome."

1579
01:35:50,055 --> 01:35:51,694
It goes on and on.

1580
01:35:51,975 --> 01:35:56,127
"Daily we are propagandized more
and more by the rising crime wave."

1581
01:35:56,775 --> 01:35:59,164
Seems pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie.

1582
01:36:19,176 --> 01:36:20,164
Proloid.

1583
01:36:22,376 --> 01:36:25,253
I took it once for a low thyroid condition.

1584
01:36:26,095 --> 01:36:28,087
It raises the metabolism.

1585
01:36:29,456 --> 01:36:32,845
Ferrie strike you as the kind of person
with a low metabolism?

1586
01:36:32,935 --> 01:36:36,087
Hardly, I'd say the opposite.
Maybe hypertension.

1587
01:36:36,775 --> 01:36:41,405
Ferrie was the only one to express
any kind of remorse about the whole thing.

1588
01:36:43,015 --> 01:36:44,734
I think it got him killed.

1589
01:36:46,536 --> 01:36:48,173
More bad news from Miami.

1590
01:36:48,336 --> 01:36:50,975
Ferrie's friend, Eladio del Valle,
was found...

1591
01:36:51,176 --> 01:36:53,929
<i>...hacked to death with a machete</i>
<i>in his car.</i>

1592
01:36:54,095 --> 01:36:58,850
He was tortured, shot point-blank
in the heart, his skull split open with an ax.

1593
01:36:59,496 --> 01:37:01,327
Ain't that the devil's piss!

1594
01:37:01,416 --> 01:37:04,488
Found another note. Same thing.
No name. No signature.

1595
01:37:04,775 --> 01:37:09,007
"When you receive this, I'll be quite dead,
so no answer is possible.

1596
01:37:09,256 --> 01:37:13,771
-"I offered you love, I got kicked."
-Must've pressed to come up with that.

1597
01:37:15,855 --> 01:37:20,292
What if a man with hypertension
were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?

1598
01:37:20,815 --> 01:37:25,252
He'd die quickly. A heart storm
or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.

1599
01:37:25,935 --> 01:37:28,814
Can you ascertain if there's Proloid
in his system?

1600
01:37:28,975 --> 01:37:30,694
Not with a routine autopsy.

1601
01:37:30,855 --> 01:37:34,212
But there may be a high level of iodine
in the spinal fluid.

1602
01:37:34,376 --> 01:37:37,253
But it's difficult to know.
What're you thinking?

1603
01:37:39,015 --> 01:37:42,372
It doesn't make sense.
Would a man afraid of dying...

1604
01:37:42,536 --> 01:37:45,255
...kill himself in a way that leaves no trace?

1605
01:37:46,576 --> 01:37:49,170
And leave two unsigned suicide notes?

1606
01:37:49,576 --> 01:37:52,170
If it's a suicide, I've seen weirder.

1607
01:37:52,975 --> 01:37:55,934
The fact is, he's gone. And so is our case.

1608
01:37:56,136 --> 01:37:57,694
Unless we go for Shaw now.

1609
01:37:57,775 --> 01:38:00,926
With whose testimony?
O'Keefe, a male prostitute?

1610
01:38:01,456 --> 01:38:04,333
Jack Martin, a drunk?
Vernon Bundy, a dope fiend?

1611
01:38:04,496 --> 01:38:08,329
Shaw's got respect. Newspaper editors,
American Bar Association.

1612
01:38:08,496 --> 01:38:12,045
-I agree. We don't have the goods.
-We wait, Shaw will get whacked!

1613
01:38:12,136 --> 01:38:15,252
How many corpses do you need
to figure out what's going on?

1614
01:38:15,336 --> 01:38:17,850
Watch your mouth! Ferrie did this himself.

1615
01:38:18,216 --> 01:38:19,614
Where're you going?

1616
01:38:19,695 --> 01:38:20,970
I don't know.

1617
01:38:21,416 --> 01:38:23,054
I just don't know.

1618
01:38:28,055 --> 01:38:30,206
Frank, you're wasting your time here.

1619
01:38:30,296 --> 01:38:32,810
Big Jim gave strict orders. No FBI.

1620
01:38:33,015 --> 01:38:34,448
It's you I want to talk to.

1621
01:38:34,536 --> 01:38:37,175
Boss'd fry me in hog fat
if he knew I talked to you.

1622
01:38:37,256 --> 01:38:39,564
Boss's got a problem. Real serious.

1623
01:38:39,735 --> 01:38:41,567
We know what's going on at your office.

1624
01:38:41,655 --> 01:38:42,850
I guess you do.

1625
01:38:43,015 --> 01:38:46,804
You got nothing. I'm a friend.
You're riding on the Titanic.

1626
01:38:47,015 --> 01:38:49,814
Time to jump off
before you get destroyed, too.

1627
01:38:50,015 --> 01:38:51,131
Enough!

1628
01:38:51,296 --> 01:38:54,287
We're talking about your career.
You're young.

1629
01:38:55,095 --> 01:38:56,768
You're working on the Castro thing.

1630
01:38:56,855 --> 01:38:58,448
-No, I'm not.
-You are.

1631
01:38:58,615 --> 01:39:01,926
We know Oswald didn't pull that trigger.
Castro did.

1632
01:39:02,456 --> 01:39:04,207
If it comes out, there'll be a war.

1633
01:39:04,296 --> 01:39:08,528
Millions of people will die.
That's more important than Jim Garrison.

1634
01:39:08,895 --> 01:39:11,887
Look at me when I talk to you!
You're too selfish!

1635
01:39:12,055 --> 01:39:13,283
Shut up!

1636
01:39:13,735 --> 01:39:18,127
If you got a brain in your thick skull,
listen to me. Listen real hard.

1637
01:39:19,216 --> 01:39:20,444
Get in the car.

1638
01:39:41,256 --> 01:39:42,449
Garrison?

1639
01:39:43,576 --> 01:39:44,564
Yes.

1640
01:39:45,735 --> 01:39:47,010
Glad you came.

1641
01:39:47,336 --> 01:39:49,087
Sorry about the precautions.

1642
01:39:49,176 --> 01:39:51,895
I just hope it was worth my while, Mr...?

1643
01:39:52,775 --> 01:39:56,371
I could give you a false name,
but I won't. Call me "X."

1644
01:39:57,815 --> 01:40:02,094
I've already been warned by the Agency,
so, if this is another threat--

1645
01:40:02,615 --> 01:40:05,083
I'm not with the Agency, Mr. Garrison.

1646
01:40:05,735 --> 01:40:09,364
If you've come this far,
what I have to say interests you.

1647
01:40:09,735 --> 01:40:12,773
I won't name names or tell you who
or what I represent.

1648
01:40:13,536 --> 01:40:15,253
Except to say you're close.

1649
01:40:16,456 --> 01:40:18,047
Closer than you think.

1650
01:40:21,496 --> 01:40:24,488
Everything I'll say is classified top secret.

1651
01:40:25,216 --> 01:40:28,014
I was a soldier, Mr. Garrison. Two wars.

1652
01:40:28,855 --> 01:40:31,847
A secret Pentagon guy,
supplying the hardware:

1653
01:40:32,655 --> 01:40:34,692
Planes, bullets, rifles...

1654
01:40:34,895 --> 01:40:37,251
...for what we call "Black Operations."

1655
01:40:37,416 --> 01:40:40,055
Black Ops. Assassinations. <i>Coups d'tat</i>...

1656
01:40:40,216 --> 01:40:43,014
...rigging elections,
propaganda, psych warfare.

1657
01:40:43,935 --> 01:40:47,372
In World War Il, I was in Rumania,
Greece, Yugoslavia.

1658
01:40:47,775 --> 01:40:51,849
I helped evacuate part of Nazi intelligence
at the end of the war.

1659
01:40:52,496 --> 01:40:54,850
And we used those guys
against the Communists.

1660
01:40:54,935 --> 01:40:57,244
In ltaly, '48, we stole the elections.

1661
01:40:57,416 --> 01:40:59,725
France '49, we broke the strikes.

1662
01:41:00,095 --> 01:41:03,087
<i>Overthrew Quirino in the Philippines,</i>
<i>Arbenz in Guatemala...</i>

1663
01:41:03,176 --> 01:41:05,974
<i>...Mossadegh in Iran.</i>
<i>We were in Vietnam in '54...</i>

1664
01:41:06,376 --> 01:41:08,492
<i>...Indonesia, '58, Tibet, '59.</i>

1665
01:41:09,136 --> 01:41:11,774
Got the Dalai Lama out. We were good.

1666
01:41:13,456 --> 01:41:14,729
Very good.

1667
01:41:15,695 --> 01:41:18,289
Then we got into the Cuban thing.
Not so good.

1668
01:41:18,576 --> 01:41:21,726
Set up an invasion to take place
in October, '62.

1669
01:41:22,136 --> 01:41:25,332
Khrushchev sent missiles to resist.
Kennedy didn't invade.

1670
01:41:25,975 --> 01:41:28,409
We just had our dicks in the wind.

1671
01:41:28,655 --> 01:41:31,250
A lot of pissed-off people, Mr. Garrison.

1672
01:41:31,336 --> 01:41:32,451
Understand?

1673
01:41:33,136 --> 01:41:34,728
I'll come to that later.

1674
01:41:35,376 --> 01:41:36,774
So, 1963....

1675
01:41:37,975 --> 01:41:40,444
I spent much of September of '63...

1676
01:41:40,975 --> 01:41:44,127
...working on the Kennedy plan
to get all US personnel...

1677
01:41:44,216 --> 01:41:46,810
...out of Vietnam by the end of 1965.

1678
01:41:47,216 --> 01:41:51,095
One of the strongest plans issued
by the Kennedy White House...

1679
01:41:51,536 --> 01:41:53,765
...National Security Memo 263...

1680
01:41:53,935 --> 01:41:56,006
...ordered home the first 1,000 troops.

1681
01:41:56,975 --> 01:42:01,173
<i>But in November, a week after the murder</i>
<i>of Vietnamese President Diem...</i>

1682
01:42:01,376 --> 01:42:03,935
<i>...and two weeks before</i>
<i>Kennedy's assassination...</i>

1683
01:42:04,015 --> 01:42:06,291
<i>...a strange thing happened to me.</i>

1684
01:42:08,496 --> 01:42:10,134
Is Dave in there?

1685
01:42:14,895 --> 01:42:17,126
You wanted to see me, General?

1686
01:42:17,296 --> 01:42:18,649
I do, indeed.

1687
01:42:19,055 --> 01:42:21,011
You're going to the South Pole.

1688
01:42:21,296 --> 01:42:22,411
I am?

1689
01:42:22,615 --> 01:42:24,527
Dr. Mooney's got the details.

1690
01:42:24,695 --> 01:42:27,335
Check with him. Have a nice vacation.

1691
01:42:28,176 --> 01:42:31,247
<i>I was sent by my superior,</i>
<i>we'll call him "Y"...</i>

1692
01:42:31,416 --> 01:42:34,010
<i>...I was sent by General Y</i>
<i>to the South Pole...</i>

1693
01:42:34,615 --> 01:42:38,131
<i>...as military escort for a group</i>
<i>of international VIPs.</i>

1694
01:42:38,855 --> 01:42:41,529
<i>I was on my way back, in New Zealand...</i>

1695
01:42:42,695 --> 01:42:44,765
<i>...when the President was killed.</i>

1696
01:42:46,855 --> 01:42:49,494
Oswald was charged at 7:00 p.m.,
Dallas time...

1697
01:42:49,576 --> 01:42:51,009
<i>...with Tippet's murder.</i>

1698
01:42:51,095 --> 01:42:54,054
<i>That's 2:00 p.m. the next day</i>
<i>in New Zealand.</i>

1699
01:42:54,615 --> 01:42:57,653
<i>But already their papers</i>
<i>had the entire history...</i>

1700
01:42:57,815 --> 01:43:00,376
<i>...of this unknown, 24</i>-<i>year</i>-<i>old Oswald.</i>

1701
01:43:00,456 --> 01:43:03,653
<i>Studio picture, detailed biography,</i>
<i>Russian information...</i>

1702
01:43:03,735 --> 01:43:06,613
<i>...and were sure that he killed</i>
<i>the President alone...</i>

1703
01:43:06,695 --> 01:43:11,087
<i>...although it took them four more hours</i>
<i>to charge him with that crime in Dallas.</i>

1704
01:43:13,176 --> 01:43:14,768
It felt to me as if...

1705
01:43:15,895 --> 01:43:18,011
...a cover story was being put out.

1706
01:43:18,095 --> 01:43:19,926
Like we would in a Black Op.

1707
01:43:21,935 --> 01:43:23,414
After I came back...

1708
01:43:23,496 --> 01:43:27,091
...I asked myself, why was l,
the chief of Special Ops...

1709
01:43:27,256 --> 01:43:30,009
...sent to the South Pole to do a job...

1710
01:43:30,296 --> 01:43:31,967
...many others could have done?

1711
01:43:32,055 --> 01:43:33,886
I wondered if it could've been because...

1712
01:43:33,975 --> 01:43:36,774
...one of my routine duties,
if I'd been in Washington...

1713
01:43:36,855 --> 01:43:39,654
...would've been to order
additional security in Texas.

1714
01:43:39,735 --> 01:43:42,569
I checked it out and found that someone...

1715
01:43:43,336 --> 01:43:47,488
...told the 112th Military Intelligence Group
at Fort Sam Houston...

1716
01:43:48,055 --> 01:43:51,810
...to stand down that day,
over the protests of Colonel Reich.

1717
01:43:52,456 --> 01:43:54,287
I believe it's a mistake.

1718
01:43:54,456 --> 01:43:58,971
It's standard procedure, especially
in a known hostile city like Dallas...

1719
01:43:59,735 --> 01:44:01,646
...to supplement the Secret Service.

1720
01:44:01,735 --> 01:44:04,886
<i>Even if we hadn't let him ride</i>
<i>with the bubble</i>-<i>top off...</i>

1721
01:44:05,496 --> 01:44:09,283
<i>...we would've put 100 to 200 agents</i>
<i>on the sidewalk without question.</i>

1722
01:44:09,735 --> 01:44:13,887
A month before, in Dallas, UN Ambassador
Adlai Stevenson was spit on and hit.

1723
01:44:13,975 --> 01:44:16,774
There had been attempts
on De Gaulle's life in France.

1724
01:44:16,855 --> 01:44:19,654
<i>We'd have arrived days ahead,</i>
<i>studied the route...</i>

1725
01:44:19,735 --> 01:44:21,135
<i>...checked all the buildings.</i>

1726
01:44:21,216 --> 01:44:24,287
<i>Never would've allowed open windows</i>
<i>overlooking Dealey. Never!</i>

1727
01:44:24,376 --> 01:44:26,367
Our own snipers
would've covered the area.

1728
01:44:26,456 --> 01:44:28,605
If a window went up,
they'd have been on the radio!

1729
01:44:28,695 --> 01:44:31,971
<i>We'd be watching the crowd:</i>
<i>packages, rolled</i>-<i>up newspapers, coats.</i>

1730
01:44:32,055 --> 01:44:34,364
<i>Never would've let a man</i>
<i>open an umbrella.</i>

1731
01:44:34,456 --> 01:44:37,253
<i>Never would've let the car slow down</i>
<i>to ten miles an hour.</i>

1732
01:44:37,336 --> 01:44:39,975
<i>Or take that unusual curve</i>
<i>at Houston and Elm.</i>

1733
01:44:40,536 --> 01:44:43,733
You'd have felt an Army presence
in the streets that day.

1734
01:44:43,895 --> 01:44:48,287
But none of this happened. It violated
our most basic protection codes.

1735
01:44:48,775 --> 01:44:52,404
And it is the best indication
of a massive plot in Dallas.

1736
01:44:53,655 --> 01:44:55,646
Who could have best done this?

1737
01:44:55,815 --> 01:44:57,886
Black Ops. People in my business.

1738
01:44:58,055 --> 01:45:01,014
My superior could've called Col. Reich
and said:

1739
01:45:01,176 --> 01:45:05,010
"We have another unit coming for security.
You'll stand down."

1740
01:45:05,576 --> 01:45:08,851
<i>That day, some Army Intelligence people</i>
<i>were in Dallas.</i>

1741
01:45:09,015 --> 01:45:10,608
<i>I don't know who or why.</i>

1742
01:45:10,935 --> 01:45:13,006
<i>But they weren't protecting clients.</i>

1743
01:45:13,095 --> 01:45:16,690
<i>And Oswald. Army Intell had</i>
<i>a Lee Harvey Oswald on file.</i>

1744
01:45:17,576 --> 01:45:19,805
Those files have been destroyed.

1745
01:45:19,975 --> 01:45:22,206
Many strange things were happening.

1746
01:45:22,296 --> 01:45:24,490
Oswald had nothing to do with them.

1747
01:45:26,136 --> 01:45:28,524
The entire Cabinet was in the Far East.

1748
01:45:28,695 --> 01:45:31,654
A third of a combat division
was returning from Germany...

1749
01:45:31,735 --> 01:45:35,251
...in the air above the United States,
at the time of the shooting.

1750
01:45:35,336 --> 01:45:39,488
At 12:34 p.m., the Washington
telephone system went out for an hour.

1751
01:45:41,336 --> 01:45:42,769
<i>On the plane back to Washington...</i>

1752
01:45:42,855 --> 01:45:45,244
<i>...word was radioed</i>
<i>from the Situations Room...</i>

1753
01:45:45,336 --> 01:45:47,975
<i>...to Johnson that there</i>
<i>was only one assassin.</i>

1754
01:45:48,136 --> 01:45:50,411
Sound like coincidences to you?

1755
01:45:51,095 --> 01:45:52,529
Not for one moment.

1756
01:45:53,176 --> 01:45:55,451
The Cabinet was out of the way.

1757
01:45:56,536 --> 01:45:58,925
Troops for riot control were in the air.

1758
01:45:59,095 --> 01:46:02,452
Telephones were out to stop
the wrong stories from spreading.

1759
01:46:02,536 --> 01:46:04,207
Nothing was left to chance.

1760
01:46:04,296 --> 01:46:07,048
He could not be allowed to escape alive.

1761
01:46:10,336 --> 01:46:12,610
Things were never the same after that.

1762
01:46:13,655 --> 01:46:16,375
Vietnam started for real.
There was an air of...

1763
01:46:17,576 --> 01:46:19,725
...make-believe in the Pentagon and CIA.

1764
01:46:19,815 --> 01:46:23,809
Those of us in Secret Ops knew
the Warren Commission was fiction.

1765
01:46:24,456 --> 01:46:26,127
But there was something...

1766
01:46:26,615 --> 01:46:27,890
...deeper.

1767
01:46:28,055 --> 01:46:29,091
Uglier.

1768
01:46:29,256 --> 01:46:32,487
I knew Allen Dulles well.
I often briefed him in his house.

1769
01:46:32,615 --> 01:46:37,246
But why was he appointed to investigate
Kennedy's death? The man who fired him.

1770
01:46:37,975 --> 01:46:41,012
<i>Dulles, by the way,</i>
<i>was General Y's benefactor.</i>

1771
01:46:43,176 --> 01:46:44,814
I got out in '64.

1772
01:46:45,576 --> 01:46:47,213
Resigned my commission.

1773
01:46:48,775 --> 01:46:52,689
I never realized Kennedy was so dangerous
to the establishment.

1774
01:46:53,256 --> 01:46:54,654
Is that why?

1775
01:46:55,336 --> 01:46:57,895
That's the real question, isn't it? Why?

1776
01:46:58,136 --> 01:47:01,412
The how and the who is just scenery
for the public.

1777
01:47:02,296 --> 01:47:04,604
Oswald, Ruby, Cuba, the Mafia...

1778
01:47:05,576 --> 01:47:07,487
...keeps them guessing, like a game.

1779
01:47:07,576 --> 01:47:10,613
Prevents them from asking
the most important question: why?

1780
01:47:10,695 --> 01:47:13,368
Why was Kennedy killed? Who benefited?

1781
01:47:14,055 --> 01:47:16,729
Who has the power to cover it up? Who?

1782
01:47:20,496 --> 01:47:21,770
In 1961...

1783
01:47:23,296 --> 01:47:26,731
<i>...right after the Bay of Pigs,</i>
<i>very few people know this...</i>

1784
01:47:27,296 --> 01:47:31,368
<i>...I participated in drawing up</i>
<i>National Security Action Memos 55, 56, 5</i>7.

1785
01:47:32,176 --> 01:47:34,895
<i>These are documents classified top secret.</i>

1786
01:47:35,136 --> 01:47:38,890
<i>In them, Kennedy told Gen. Lemnitzer,</i>
<i>chairman of the Joint Chiefs...</i>

1787
01:47:39,055 --> 01:47:42,969
<i>...that from here on, the Joint Chiefs</i>
<i>would be wholly responsible...</i>

1788
01:47:43,136 --> 01:47:46,014
<i>...for all covert paramilitary action</i>
<i>in peacetime.</i>

1789
01:47:46,576 --> 01:47:48,567
<i>This ended the reign of the CIA.</i>

1790
01:47:49,055 --> 01:47:52,412
<i>Splintered it into 1,000 pieces,</i>
<i>as JFK promised he would.</i>

1791
01:47:52,655 --> 01:47:54,805
<i>And now he was ordering the military...</i>

1792
01:47:54,895 --> 01:47:57,126
<i>...to help him do it. Unprecedented!</i>

1793
01:47:57,216 --> 01:48:01,606
I can't tell you the shock waves this sent
along the corridors of power.

1794
01:48:01,935 --> 01:48:03,926
This and the firing of Allen Dulles...

1795
01:48:04,015 --> 01:48:06,166
<i>...Richard Bissell and Gen. Charles Cabell.</i>

1796
01:48:06,256 --> 01:48:09,453
<i>All were sacred cows in Intell</i>
<i>since World War II.</i>

1797
01:48:09,855 --> 01:48:11,926
<i>They got some very upset people.</i>

1798
01:48:12,975 --> 01:48:15,934
Kennedy's directives weren't implemented
because of...

1799
01:48:16,015 --> 01:48:18,086
...bureaucratic resistance.

1800
01:48:18,815 --> 01:48:20,806
But one of the results was...

1801
01:48:21,055 --> 01:48:24,685
...the Cuban operation was turned over
to my department...

1802
01:48:25,055 --> 01:48:27,046
...as Operation Mongoose.

1803
01:48:27,536 --> 01:48:29,685
Mongoose was pure Black Ops.

1804
01:48:30,095 --> 01:48:33,054
It was secretly based at Miami University...

1805
01:48:33,456 --> 01:48:36,253
...which has the largest
domestic CIA station...

1806
01:48:36,496 --> 01:48:39,293
...budgeted annually for hundreds
of millions of dollars.

1807
01:48:39,376 --> 01:48:41,844
Three hundred agents, 7,000 select Cubans.

1808
01:48:42,735 --> 01:48:45,296
Fifty fake business fronts
to launder money.

1809
01:48:45,496 --> 01:48:48,168
They waged a non-stop war against Castro.

1810
01:48:48,376 --> 01:48:50,685
Industrial sabotage, crop burning, etc.

1811
01:48:51,055 --> 01:48:53,171
All under the control of General Y.

1812
01:48:53,855 --> 01:48:56,494
<i>He took the rules of covert warfare</i>
<i>he'd used abroad...</i>

1813
01:48:56,576 --> 01:48:58,328
<i>...and brought them to this country.</i>

1814
01:48:58,416 --> 01:49:01,055
<i>Now he had the people,</i>
<i>the equipment, the bases...</i>

1815
01:49:01,136 --> 01:49:02,694
<i>...and the motivation.</i>

1816
01:49:02,815 --> 01:49:07,207
Don't underestimate the budget cuts
that Kennedy called for in March of 1963.

1817
01:49:07,456 --> 01:49:10,253
Nearly 52 military installations
in 25 states.

1818
01:49:10,496 --> 01:49:12,167
Twenty-one overseas bases.

1819
01:49:12,576 --> 01:49:13,895
Big money.

1820
01:49:14,095 --> 01:49:17,292
You know how many helicopters
have been lost in Vietnam?

1821
01:49:18,176 --> 01:49:19,927
Nearly 3,000 so far.

1822
01:49:20,815 --> 01:49:23,853
<i>Who makes them?</i>
<i>Bell Helicopter. Who owns Bell?</i>

1823
01:49:24,176 --> 01:49:27,850
Bell was nearly bankrupt when First
National Bank of Boston asked the CIA...

1824
01:49:27,935 --> 01:49:31,849
...to use the helicopter in Indochina.
How about the F-111 fighter?

1825
01:49:32,256 --> 01:49:35,292
<i>General Dynamics of Fort Worth, Texas.</i>
<i>Who owns that?</i>

1826
01:49:35,456 --> 01:49:39,971
Find out the defense budget since
the war began. $75 going on $100 billion.

1827
01:49:40,176 --> 01:49:43,054
Nearly $200 billion will be spent
before it's over.

1828
01:49:43,456 --> 01:49:45,367
In 1949, it was $10 billion.

1829
01:49:45,536 --> 01:49:47,207
No war...no money.

1830
01:49:48,176 --> 01:49:51,690
The organizing principle
of any society, Mr. Garrison...

1831
01:49:52,015 --> 01:49:53,448
...is for war.

1832
01:49:53,615 --> 01:49:57,449
The authority of the state over its people
resides in its war powers.

1833
01:49:57,775 --> 01:50:00,734
Kennedy wanted to end the Cold War
in his second term.

1834
01:50:00,895 --> 01:50:04,252
He wanted to call off the moon race
and cooperate with the Soviets.

1835
01:50:04,336 --> 01:50:06,804
He signed a treaty to ban nuclear testing.

1836
01:50:06,975 --> 01:50:09,409
He refused to invade Cuba in 1962.

1837
01:50:09,615 --> 01:50:12,130
He set out to withdraw from Vietnam.

1838
01:50:13,296 --> 01:50:16,332
But all that ended
on the 22nd of November, 1963.

1839
01:50:17,775 --> 01:50:22,007
<i>Since 1961, they knew Kennedy</i>
<i>was not going to war in Southeast Asia.</i>

1840
01:50:22,416 --> 01:50:24,850
<i>Like Caesar, he is surrounded by enemies.</i>

1841
01:50:24,975 --> 01:50:29,287
<i>Something's underway, but it has no face.</i>
<i>Yet, everybody in the loop knows.</i>

1842
01:50:29,456 --> 01:50:31,047
Forget about combat troops.

1843
01:50:31,136 --> 01:50:34,650
He told McNamara he would pull out
the goddamn advisors!

1844
01:50:35,775 --> 01:50:39,291
He fucked us in Laos and now
he will fuck us in Vietnam!

1845
01:50:40,336 --> 01:50:43,293
He can't afford to implement it
before the election.

1846
01:50:43,536 --> 01:50:45,845
I hear the NSC meeting
was a real barn burner.

1847
01:50:45,935 --> 01:50:50,407
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
Heads will roll. Hear about Lemnitzer?

1848
01:50:50,615 --> 01:50:51,445
What?

1849
01:50:51,615 --> 01:50:53,925
Kennedy rubbed Lem's nose in shit.

1850
01:50:54,095 --> 01:50:56,814
Said if we didn't go into Cuba,
which was so close...

1851
01:50:56,895 --> 01:50:59,534
...why go into Vietnam
which is so far away?

1852
01:50:59,775 --> 01:51:01,128
There he goes again.

1853
01:51:01,216 --> 01:51:03,286
Got his hand on the chicken switch.

1854
01:51:03,456 --> 01:51:06,573
Lem said that the Chiefs still think
we should go into Cuba.

1855
01:51:06,655 --> 01:51:08,055
<i>Money's at stake.</i>

1856
01:51:08,256 --> 01:51:10,247
Big money. $100 billion.

1857
01:51:11,216 --> 01:51:14,014
Kennedy bred voting districts
for defense dollars.

1858
01:51:14,256 --> 01:51:18,488
<i>He gave TFX fighter contracts only</i>
<i>to those counties that will matter in '64.</i>

1859
01:51:18,655 --> 01:51:21,295
<i>The people in the loop fight back.</i>
<i>Their way.</i>

1860
01:51:21,655 --> 01:51:24,011
We have to control the intelligence
from Saigon.

1861
01:51:24,095 --> 01:51:27,610
We just don't let McNamara stick his nose
in this thing!

1862
01:51:28,176 --> 01:51:31,930
Every time he goes over to Saigon
for a fact-finding mission...

1863
01:51:32,095 --> 01:51:34,974
...he comes back and scares the shit
out of Kennedy!

1864
01:51:35,216 --> 01:51:37,365
Now I want Max Taylor on him
night and day...

1865
01:51:37,456 --> 01:51:39,287
...like a fly on shit.

1866
01:51:40,015 --> 01:51:42,814
You control McNamara,
you control Kennedy.

1867
01:51:44,015 --> 01:51:45,768
<i>I think it started like that.</i>

1868
01:51:45,855 --> 01:51:47,208
In the wind.

1869
01:51:47,376 --> 01:51:50,685
Defense contractors, oil bankers.
Just conversation.

1870
01:51:51,296 --> 01:51:55,050
A call is made. Maybe to someone
like my superior officer General Y.

1871
01:51:56,176 --> 01:51:58,484
<i>We're going. We need your help.</i>

1872
01:51:58,815 --> 01:51:59,850
When?

1873
01:52:00,336 --> 01:52:02,850
<i>In the fall. Probably in the South.</i>

1874
01:52:03,216 --> 01:52:06,048
-<i>We want you to come up with a plan.</i>
-I can do that.

1875
01:52:06,136 --> 01:52:07,854
<i>Everything is cellularized.</i>

1876
01:52:08,015 --> 01:52:11,452
<i>No one said, "He must die." No vote.</i>
<i>Nothing's on paper.</i>

1877
01:52:11,775 --> 01:52:13,413
<i>There's no one to blame.</i>

1878
01:52:13,855 --> 01:52:16,006
It's as old as the crucifixion.

1879
01:52:16,176 --> 01:52:18,087
Or the military firing squad.

1880
01:52:18,256 --> 01:52:21,088
Five bullets, one blank. No one's guilty.

1881
01:52:21,935 --> 01:52:23,688
Everybody in the power structure...

1882
01:52:23,775 --> 01:52:26,051
<i>...has a plausible deniability.</i>

1883
01:52:26,296 --> 01:52:29,765
<i>No compromising connections</i>
<i>except at the most secret point.</i>

1884
01:52:30,256 --> 01:52:32,007
<i>But it must succeed.</i>

1885
01:52:32,735 --> 01:52:35,296
<i>No matter how many die</i>
<i>or how much it costs...</i>

1886
01:52:35,416 --> 01:52:38,168
<i>...the perpetrators must be</i>
<i>on the winning side...</i>

1887
01:52:38,336 --> 01:52:42,011
<i>...and never subject to prosecution</i>
<i>for anything by anyone.</i>

1888
01:52:42,256 --> 01:52:44,087
<i>That is a</i> coup d'tat.

1889
01:52:47,815 --> 01:52:50,728
Kennedy announces the Texas trip
in September.

1890
01:52:50,895 --> 01:52:54,127
At that moment, second Oswalds
pop up all over Dallas...

1891
01:52:54,216 --> 01:52:56,889
<i>...where they have the mayor</i>
<i>and the cops in their pocket.</i>

1892
01:52:56,975 --> 01:52:59,126
<i>General Y flies in the assassins.</i>

1893
01:52:59,296 --> 01:53:02,810
<i>Maybe from the special camp</i>
<i>we keep near Athens, Greece.</i>

1894
01:53:03,055 --> 01:53:03,931
<i>Pros.</i>

1895
01:53:04,095 --> 01:53:07,452
<i>They'd be locals, Cubans, Mafia hire.</i>
<i>Separate teams.</i>

1896
01:53:07,855 --> 01:53:09,573
<i>Does it matter who shot...</i>

1897
01:53:10,176 --> 01:53:11,768
<i>...from what rooftop?</i>

1898
01:53:13,055 --> 01:53:14,648
<i>Part of the scenery.</i>

1899
01:53:15,216 --> 01:53:17,604
I keep thinking about that Tuesday...

1900
01:53:17,855 --> 01:53:19,288
<i>...the 26th of November.</i>

1901
01:53:19,376 --> 01:53:21,047
<i>The day after they buried Kennedy.</i>

1902
01:53:21,136 --> 01:53:24,810
Gentlemen, I am not going to let Vietnam
go like China did.

1903
01:53:25,456 --> 01:53:26,809
I'm committed...

1904
01:53:27,216 --> 01:53:31,606
...not to take our soldiers out of there
till they know we mean business in Asia.

1905
01:53:31,775 --> 01:53:34,972
<i>Lyndon Johnson signs</i>
<i>National Security Memo 2</i>7<i>3...</i>

1906
01:53:35,216 --> 01:53:37,935
<i>...which reverses</i>
<i>Kennedy's withdrawal policy...</i>

1907
01:53:38,095 --> 01:53:40,814
<i>...and approves covert action</i>
<i>against North Vietnam...</i>

1908
01:53:40,895 --> 01:53:43,046
<i>...provoking the Gulf of Tonkin incident.</i>

1909
01:53:43,136 --> 01:53:46,252
Just get me elected,
I'll give you the damn war.

1910
01:53:47,456 --> 01:53:49,127
<i>In that document...</i>

1911
01:53:50,095 --> 01:53:51,688
...lay the Vietnam War.

1912
01:53:57,055 --> 01:54:00,685
I can't believe they killed him
because he wanted to change things.

1913
01:54:01,855 --> 01:54:05,131
-ln our time, in our country!
-They've done it throughout history.

1914
01:54:05,216 --> 01:54:08,492
Kings are killed. Politics is power,
nothing more!

1915
01:54:09,456 --> 01:54:12,573
Don't take my word for it.
Do your own thinking.

1916
01:54:15,136 --> 01:54:16,649
The size of this is...

1917
01:54:17,456 --> 01:54:18,729
...beyond me.

1918
01:54:19,256 --> 01:54:20,484
Testify.

1919
01:54:20,576 --> 01:54:22,009
-Me?
-Testify.

1920
01:54:23,536 --> 01:54:25,048
No chance in hell.

1921
01:54:25,775 --> 01:54:29,564
No, I'd be arrested and gagged.
Maybe sent to an institution.

1922
01:54:29,695 --> 01:54:31,253
Maybe worse. You too.

1923
01:54:32,176 --> 01:54:36,168
I can give you the background.
You find the foreground, the little things.

1924
01:54:36,256 --> 01:54:39,770
Dig, you're the only one to bring a trial
in Kennedy's murder.

1925
01:54:40,015 --> 01:54:42,246
That's important. It's historic.

1926
01:54:42,895 --> 01:54:44,328
I haven't yet.

1927
01:54:45,055 --> 01:54:47,206
I don't have much of a case.

1928
01:54:48,256 --> 01:54:50,247
You don't have a choice anymore.

1929
01:54:50,496 --> 01:54:54,011
You're a significant threat
to the national security structure.

1930
01:54:54,416 --> 01:54:57,293
They'd have killed you already,
but there's light on you.

1931
01:54:57,376 --> 01:54:59,445
So they'll destroy your credibility.

1932
01:54:59,536 --> 01:55:01,605
They already have in many circles.

1933
01:55:01,935 --> 01:55:03,130
Be honest.

1934
01:55:03,456 --> 01:55:07,529
Your only chance is to come up
with a case. Something. Anything.

1935
01:55:08,055 --> 01:55:10,489
Make arrests. Stir the shitstorm.

1936
01:55:11,216 --> 01:55:12,807
Hope to start...

1937
01:55:13,136 --> 01:55:15,695
...a chain reaction
of people coming forward.

1938
01:55:15,775 --> 01:55:17,686
Then the government will crack.

1939
01:55:17,775 --> 01:55:20,893
Fundamentally, people are suckers
for the truth.

1940
01:55:21,055 --> 01:55:23,286
And the truth is on your side, bubba.

1941
01:55:30,256 --> 01:55:32,087
I just hope you get a break.

1942
01:56:15,336 --> 01:56:16,131
Mr. Shaw?

1943
01:56:17,136 --> 01:56:19,411
You are under arrest for conspiracy...

1944
01:56:19,695 --> 01:56:23,847
...and entering into agreement with others
for the purpose of murdering...

1945
01:56:24,015 --> 01:56:25,688
...President John F. Kennedy.

1946
01:56:25,775 --> 01:56:28,210
We have a warrant to search the premises.

1947
01:56:28,655 --> 01:56:30,533
It's my duty to inform you...

1948
01:56:31,136 --> 01:56:33,604
...you have the right to remain silent.

1949
01:56:33,775 --> 01:56:34,890
Name?

1950
01:56:35,296 --> 01:56:36,887
Clay LaVerne Shaw.

1951
01:56:39,216 --> 01:56:40,251
Address?

1952
01:56:40,416 --> 01:56:42,850
1313 Dauphine Street, New Orleans.

1953
01:56:44,496 --> 01:56:46,292
Ever use any aliases?

1954
01:56:46,576 --> 01:56:48,055
Clay Bertrand.

1955
01:56:54,095 --> 01:56:58,168
Mr. Clark, are you aware of the charges
filed by District Attorney Garrison?

1956
01:56:58,256 --> 01:57:01,247
Yes, Mr. Shaw was included
in our investigation.

1957
01:57:01,735 --> 01:57:04,011
No connection was found at all.

1958
01:57:04,615 --> 01:57:08,006
If the FBI did investigate him,
why is his name not mentioned...

1959
01:57:08,095 --> 01:57:10,769
...in the entire 26 volumes
of the Warren Report...

1960
01:57:10,855 --> 01:57:13,086
...even if it is to clear his name?

1961
01:57:13,615 --> 01:57:17,211
I doubt this Attorney General
would qualify for my staff.

1962
01:57:17,416 --> 01:57:20,567
Mr. Garrison has presented
absolutely nothing publicly...

1963
01:57:21,256 --> 01:57:23,929
...which would contradict our findings.

1964
01:57:24,296 --> 01:57:26,969
I know of no fact which would refute...

1965
01:57:27,975 --> 01:57:30,046
...the Commission's conclusion...

1966
01:57:30,216 --> 01:57:32,889
...that Lee Oswald was the lone killer.

1967
01:57:35,296 --> 01:57:38,970
I congratulate Mr. Shaw.
Most defendants must wait for trial...

1968
01:57:39,136 --> 01:57:42,685
...before they produce sacred cows
like a Chief Justice...

1969
01:57:42,775 --> 01:57:44,368
...as a character witness...

1970
01:57:44,456 --> 01:57:47,653
...who is not under oath
and therefore free from perjury.

1971
01:57:47,815 --> 01:57:49,886
Even if it's partly true...

1972
01:57:50,216 --> 01:57:54,050
...you realize you're damaging
the credibility of the country?

1973
01:57:54,815 --> 01:57:58,524
Is a government worth preserving
when it lies to the people?

1974
01:57:59,615 --> 01:58:01,493
It's become a dangerous country...

1975
01:58:01,576 --> 01:58:05,251
...when you cannot trust anyone.
When you cannot tell the truth.

1976
01:58:06,376 --> 01:58:09,573
I say let justice be done,
though the heavens fall!

1977
01:58:15,456 --> 01:58:18,413
<i>The JFK Conspiracy:</i>
<i>The Case of Jim Garrison.</i>

1978
01:58:19,176 --> 01:58:22,770
-Honey, this is about you.
-<i>After an investigation in New Orleans...</i>

1979
01:58:22,855 --> 01:58:24,493
<i>...reporters have learned...</i>

1980
01:58:24,576 --> 01:58:27,648
<i>...that District Attorney Jim Garrison</i>
<i>and his staff...</i>

1981
01:58:27,815 --> 01:58:31,411
<i>...have intimidated,</i>
<i>bribed and even drugged witnesses...</i>

<i>...to attempt to prove a conspiracy</i>
<i>involving businessman Clay Shaw...</i>

1983

01:58:39,456 --> 01:58:43,131
<i>John Chancler was a cellmate</i>
<i>of Willie O'Keefe's at Angola.</i>

1985
01:58:43,815 --> 01:58:47,126
<i>He said he'd be cut loose</i>
<i>if he copped to the DA's office.</i>

1986
01:58:47,296 --> 01:58:49,365
I sent him up for burglary.

1987
01:58:50,376 --> 01:58:52,765
And there's his old buddy Miguel Torres.

1988
01:58:53,055 --> 01:58:54,534
We sent him up too.

1989
01:58:54,695 --> 01:58:58,654
<i>They wanted me to say Shaw</i>
<i>was Bertrand. They'd get me a pardon.</i>

1990
01:58:58,975 --> 01:59:01,854
<i>Janet Williams comments</i>
<i>on Willie O'Keefe's...</i>

1991
01:59:02,055 --> 01:59:04,444
<i>...descriptions of having met Oswald.</i>

1992
01:59:04,615 --> 01:59:06,173
<i>Was he a homosexual?</i>

1993
01:59:06,336 --> 01:59:08,485
<i>Not the Lee I knew. Absolutely not.</i>

1994
01:59:09,055 --> 01:59:12,445
<i>Mr. O'Keefe must have seen someone</i>
<i>he thought was Lee Oswald.</i>

1995
01:59:12,615 --> 01:59:16,131
<i>I didn't talk to nobody.</i>
<i>I was on drugs at the hospital.</i>

1996
01:59:16,735 --> 01:59:20,331
<i>I told the FBI that call was a figment</i>
<i>of my imagination.</i>

1997
01:59:20,576 --> 01:59:22,645
<i>I think he's quite ill, mentally.</i>

1998
01:59:22,815 --> 01:59:26,649
<i>With one half of his mind,</i>
<i>he is able to fabricate evidence...</i>

1999
01:59:27,336 --> 01:59:31,488
<i>...then he convinces the other half</i>
<i>that the fabrication is the truth.</i>

2000
01:59:32,296 --> 01:59:36,413
Don't worry. There's only 20
or 30 million people watching this tonight.

2001
01:59:38,376 --> 01:59:41,208
My reputation's all right
with the people watching <i>Laugh In</i>.

2002
01:59:41,296 --> 01:59:44,094
<i>Has he ignored the Mafia connections</i>
<i>to this conspiracy...</i>

2003
01:59:44,176 --> 01:59:46,689
<i>...because he's indebted to the mob?</i>

2004
01:59:47,655 --> 01:59:50,966
<i>The more one looks at Jim Garrison,</i>
<i>the more one finds...</i>

2005
01:59:51,136 --> 01:59:55,765
<i>...he has destroyed reputations, spread fear</i>
<i>and suspicion, and worst of all...</i>

2006
01:59:56,095 --> 01:59:59,007
<i>...exploited this nation's sorrow and doubt.</i>

2007
01:59:59,176 --> 02:00:01,006
<i>Jim Garrison has said:</i>

2008
02:00:01,895 --> 02:00:04,932
<i>"Let justice be done,</i>
<i>though the heavens fall."</i>

2009
02:00:05,576 --> 02:00:07,805
<i>He seeks the truth. So do we.</i>

2010
02:00:19,336 --> 02:00:22,930
<i>Dr. Martin Luther King's beautiful dream</i>
<i>expressed so dramatically...</i>

2011
02:00:23,015 --> 02:00:25,576
<i>...during the 1963 march on Washington...</i>

2012
02:00:25,735 --> 02:00:29,011
<i>...was shattered tonight in Memphis,</i>
<i>Tennessee by an assassin's bullet.</i>

2013
02:00:29,095 --> 02:00:32,167
<i>Police think the single shot came</i>
<i>from across the street.</i>

2014
02:00:32,256 --> 02:00:36,533
<i>They found a Browning automatic rifle,</i>
<i>fitted with a marksman's scope.</i>

2015
02:00:37,735 --> 02:00:39,135
I'll get it.

2016
02:00:41,695 --> 02:00:44,368
<i>Hello, is this Jim Garrison's daughter?</i>

2017
02:00:45,216 --> 02:00:47,046
<i>Virginia or Elizabeth?</i>

2018
02:00:48,416 --> 02:00:50,690
<i>Virginia, you're a lucky little girl.</i>

2019
02:00:50,855 --> 02:00:54,849
<i>Your daddy's entered you</i>
<i>in a beauty contest. Like to be in one?</i>

2020
02:00:55,815 --> 02:00:57,043
I don't know.

2021
02:00:57,216 --> 02:00:59,411
My God! What have they done?

2022
02:01:00,735 --> 02:01:02,215
It's lynching time.

2023
02:01:04,735 --> 02:01:06,168
That sounds fun.

2024
02:01:06,855 --> 02:01:08,926
<i>You get out of school at 3:00?</i>

2025
02:01:09,095 --> 02:01:10,609
Who are you talking to?

2026
02:01:10,695 --> 02:01:12,448
<i>That's all I need to know.</i>

2027
02:01:12,615 --> 02:01:15,448
Mommy, I'm going to be
in a beauty contest.

2028
02:01:15,615 --> 02:01:17,652
Who is this? Who is this?

2029
02:01:20,095 --> 02:01:22,689
Did you enter Virginia in a beauty contest?

2030
02:01:22,855 --> 02:01:25,494
A man called and asked her height,
her weight--

2031
02:01:25,576 --> 02:01:28,533
Some crackpot.
Martin Luther King was killed.

2032
02:01:28,735 --> 02:01:30,293
Her life's been threatened!

2033
02:01:30,376 --> 02:01:33,765
A crank making calls.
Happens a dozen times a day at the office.

2034
02:01:33,855 --> 02:01:36,323
Our home! A kidnapper, a murderer!

2035
02:01:36,576 --> 02:01:38,247
Only cowards make crank calls.

2036
02:01:38,336 --> 02:01:39,814
Nothing will happen.

2037
02:01:39,975 --> 02:01:44,287
You don't know what goes on here
anymore! You're busy making speeches!

2038
02:01:44,615 --> 02:01:47,288
Getting every crazed Klansman after us!

2039
02:01:47,496 --> 02:01:51,329
I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving!
I can't stand it anymore!

2040
02:01:51,935 --> 02:01:54,574
-The government wants us scared.
-You and your government!

2041
02:01:54,655 --> 02:01:58,204
They want everybody too scared
to speak out. They count on it.

2042
02:01:58,376 --> 02:02:01,253
-There's nothing to fear!
-Don't you have feelings?

2043
02:02:03,015 --> 02:02:04,688
Your own daughter!

2044
02:02:05,095 --> 02:02:07,131
What kind of a man are you?

2045
02:02:10,376 --> 02:02:13,493
I'll take them to my mother's.
You spend a week.

2046
02:02:14,496 --> 02:02:17,168
I'll change the locks, the phones.
I'll get a bodyguard.

2047
02:02:17,256 --> 02:02:19,167
Get a hold of yourself!

2048
02:02:19,496 --> 02:02:22,966
Before this Kennedy thing,
your children mattered most.

2049
02:02:23,456 --> 02:02:26,208
The other night you didn't
even notice Jasper.

2050
02:02:26,376 --> 02:02:28,367
He came to me bawling his eyes out.

2051
02:02:28,456 --> 02:02:31,253
I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.

2052
02:02:31,615 --> 02:02:33,333
Is it such a chore?

2053
02:02:33,576 --> 02:02:37,363
Goddamn it! If I said I'll spend
more time with him, I will!

2054
02:02:37,695 --> 02:02:40,051
I cannot fight you and the whole world too!

2055
02:02:40,136 --> 02:02:42,809
I'm not fighting you!
I'm trying to reach you.

2056
02:02:43,015 --> 02:02:45,734
-You've changed.
-Of course I've changed!

2057
02:02:46,536 --> 02:02:48,253
My eyes have opened.

2058
02:02:48,456 --> 02:02:51,208
And what once looked normal
seems insane.

2059
02:02:51,456 --> 02:02:54,765
And now King. Don't you think
this has something to do with that?

2060
02:02:54,855 --> 02:02:56,130
Can't you see?

2061
02:02:56,296 --> 02:03:00,083
I don't want to see, goddamn it!
I'm tired. I've had enough!

2062
02:03:00,296 --> 02:03:04,130
You're ruining this man Shaw's life
because he's a homosexual.

2063
02:03:04,576 --> 02:03:06,055
That's not why!

2064
02:03:06,216 --> 02:03:09,252
Did you ever once stop
to consider his feelings?

2065
02:03:11,496 --> 02:03:13,054
You don't believe me?

2066
02:03:13,376 --> 02:03:15,970
-I don't know!
-You never believed me?

2067
02:03:17,095 --> 02:03:20,690
I just want to raise our children
and live a normal life.

2068
02:03:21,095 --> 02:03:22,847
I want my life back!

2069
02:03:23,615 --> 02:03:25,368
So do l, goddamn it!

2070
02:03:26,015 --> 02:03:27,971
I had a life too, you know!

2071
02:03:28,256 --> 02:03:31,885
You can't bury your head in the sand
like an ostrich, Liz!

2072
02:03:32,136 --> 02:03:36,413
It's not about our well-being, our two cars,
our TVs and your kitchen!

2073
02:03:38,336 --> 02:03:41,645
It's about our kids growing up
in a shithole of lies. I'm angry!

2074
02:03:41,735 --> 02:03:43,771
My life is fucked because of it.

2075
02:03:43,935 --> 02:03:46,894
If you could see it that way,
you'd see your life is fucked too.

2076
02:03:46,975 --> 02:03:48,648
You never talked to me this way.

2077
02:03:48,735 --> 02:03:50,771
If you don't want to support me, fine.

2078
02:03:50,855 --> 02:03:53,574
But don't make threats
about taking the children.

2079
02:03:53,735 --> 02:03:55,135
I'm leaving you!

2080
02:03:55,336 --> 02:03:57,770
-I'm taking the children!
-Go on! Get out!

2081
02:03:57,855 --> 02:03:59,288
-I am!
-Go hide!

2082
02:03:59,456 --> 02:04:01,605
Join the rest! They'll say I'm crazy.

2083
02:04:01,695 --> 02:04:04,448
Plenty of people will tell you I'm crazy.

2084
02:04:05,855 --> 02:04:09,087
You won't have any problems
filling out divorce papers.

2085
02:04:10,055 --> 02:04:12,444
But somebody's got to try, goddamn it!

2086
02:04:12,735 --> 02:04:14,010
Somebody!

2087
02:04:18,055 --> 02:04:20,046
Are we going away, Daddy?

2088
02:04:27,136 --> 02:04:28,774
I don't know, Jasper.

2089
02:04:29,576 --> 02:04:30,975
Because of Kennedy?

2090
02:04:31,615 --> 02:04:34,083
Will the same people kill us, Papa?

2091
02:04:36,735 --> 02:04:38,488
Nobody will kill us.

2092
02:04:39,136 --> 02:04:40,284
I'm scared.

2093
02:04:41,416 --> 02:04:44,213
I don't like it when you and Mommy fight.

2094
02:04:46,975 --> 02:04:48,886
I don't like it either, honey.

2095
02:04:49,895 --> 02:04:51,851
Why do we have to leave?

2096
02:04:52,615 --> 02:04:54,652
Don't you love us anymore?

2097
02:04:57,376 --> 02:04:59,172
Daddy loves you both.

2098
02:05:00,775 --> 02:05:04,006
There's nothing wrong
with feeling a little scared, Jasper.

2099
02:05:04,416 --> 02:05:07,567
Telling the truth can be
a scary thing sometimes.

2100
02:05:08,256 --> 02:05:11,292
It scared President Kennedy,
and he was a brave man.

2101
02:05:12,095 --> 02:05:14,655
But if you let yourself be too scared...

2102
02:05:14,855 --> 02:05:17,847
...then you let the bad guys
take over the country.

2103
02:05:19,456 --> 02:05:21,367
Then everybody gets scared.

2104
02:05:22,176 --> 02:05:23,927
Stay with Mom, Papa.

2105
02:05:24,136 --> 02:05:25,329
Please.

2106
02:05:32,095 --> 02:05:32,845
Here's another.

2107
02:05:33,895 --> 02:05:37,127
The US Attorney in Washington declines
to serve our subpoena...

2108
02:05:37,216 --> 02:05:41,413
...on Allen Dulles, Charles Cabell,
CIA Director Richard Helms, any FBI agent.

2109
02:05:41,536 --> 02:05:44,095
What'd you expect from a pig but a grunt?

2110
02:05:44,296 --> 02:05:48,413
Now it'll be near impossible
to prove Shaw's connection to the CIA.

2111
02:05:48,576 --> 02:05:49,895
What's going on?

2112
02:05:50,055 --> 02:05:53,172
We've never been refused
an extradition request.

2113
02:05:53,416 --> 02:05:55,485
Let's get Julia Ann Mercer in here.

2114
02:05:55,655 --> 02:05:57,247
No, she could get hurt.

2115
02:05:57,416 --> 02:05:59,805
Look what's happening to other people.

2116
02:05:59,975 --> 02:06:02,011
She's the best witness we have.

2117
02:06:02,176 --> 02:06:05,134
I just don't want to do it. Now, what else?

2118
02:06:06,176 --> 02:06:09,485
You got your hate mail here.
And your fan mail here.

2119
02:06:10,655 --> 02:06:15,332
The bad news is that the IRS requested
an audit of your income from this office.

2120
02:06:15,935 --> 02:06:19,610
I expected that two months ago.
They're wasting their time.

2121
02:06:22,336 --> 02:06:26,328
The bad news is the National Guard
just asked me to resign after 18 years.

2122
02:06:27,496 --> 02:06:31,011
Maybe that's the good news.
Never was as good as combat.

2123
02:06:32,136 --> 02:06:33,284
But this is.

2124
02:06:34,655 --> 02:06:35,485
What else?

2125
02:06:35,576 --> 02:06:37,692
Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks...

2126
02:06:37,775 --> 02:06:39,493
<i>...before the assassination.</i>

2127
02:06:39,576 --> 02:06:41,453
<i>May I see Special Agent Hosty?</i>

2128
02:06:41,536 --> 02:06:43,287
<i>He's not in. Can someone else help you?</i>

2129
02:06:43,376 --> 02:06:47,288
<i>Special Agent Hosty made three visits</i>
<i>to Janet Williams' house...</i>

2130
02:06:47,655 --> 02:06:50,123
<i>...to keep an eye on Marina. He left a note.</i>

2131
02:06:50,216 --> 02:06:53,014
<i>Hosty told a newspaperman</i>
<i>it was a warning...</i>

2132
02:06:53,336 --> 02:06:56,533
<i>...to stop questioning Marina</i>
<i>when Oswald was not present.</i>

2133
02:06:56,775 --> 02:07:01,212
<i>She was not a citizen, so possibly</i>
<i>he was threatening to deport her to Russia.</i>

2134
02:07:02,216 --> 02:07:04,684
But what the note really said,
no one knows.

2135
02:07:04,775 --> 02:07:07,414
<i>Hosty tore it up and flushed it</i>
<i>down the toilet.</i>

2136
02:07:07,496 --> 02:07:09,054
<i>This is just speculation.</i>

2137
02:07:09,136 --> 02:07:13,095
But what if the note described
the assassination attempt on JFK?

2138
02:07:18,855 --> 02:07:20,368
Come on, think!

2139
02:07:20,895 --> 02:07:23,126
That's the only reason to destroy it.

2140
02:07:23,336 --> 02:07:27,090
If it was a threat like Hosty said,
they would have kept it.

2141
02:07:27,655 --> 02:07:31,284
It makes their case against the angry,
lone nut that much stronger.

2142
02:07:31,975 --> 02:07:33,773
Remember the meeting
with Agent Quigley...

2143
02:07:33,855 --> 02:07:35,413
<i>...the day he was arrested?</i>

2144
02:07:35,496 --> 02:07:38,215
<i>Quigley destroyed the notes</i>
<i>from the interview.</i>

2145
02:07:38,376 --> 02:07:42,493
We can raise the possibility
that Oswald was not only an informant...

2146
02:07:42,815 --> 02:07:47,492
...but he may have been the original source
for the telex dated November 17...

2147
02:07:47,975 --> 02:07:51,889
...warning of Kennedy's assassination
in Dallas on November 22.

2148
02:07:54,216 --> 02:07:57,572
<i>William Walters, the FBI night clerk,</i>
<i>gave me a copy.</i>

2149
02:07:58,536 --> 02:08:01,175
<i>It went all over the country.</i>
<i>Nothing was done.</i>

2150
02:08:01,256 --> 02:08:04,885
<i>The motorcade went ahead on schedule.</i>
<i>The Warren Report didn't mention it.</i>

2151
02:08:04,975 --> 02:08:08,969
<i>"A militant group may attempt</i>
<i>to assassinate President Kennedy...</i>

2152
02:08:09,095 --> 02:08:11,087
"...on his proposed trip to Dallas, Texas."

2153
02:08:11,176 --> 02:08:13,246
Shortly after the assassination...

2154
02:08:13,376 --> 02:08:16,731
...Walters says the telex was removed
from all the files...

2155
02:08:17,136 --> 02:08:19,809
...as an obvious embarrassment
to the Bureau.

2156
02:08:20,935 --> 02:08:23,654
I believe Oswald sent information
through Hosty.

2157
02:08:23,775 --> 02:08:26,926
<i>I have a hunch Oswald</i>
<i>had infiltrated this group:</i>

2158
02:08:27,496 --> 02:08:29,565
<i>Cubans or right</i>-<i>wing extremists.</i>

2159
02:08:30,336 --> 02:08:33,645
<i>He was told to be</i>
<i>at the Book Depository that day...</i>

2160
02:08:34,015 --> 02:08:37,212
...to either prevent the assassination
or take part in it.

2161
02:08:37,376 --> 02:08:40,731
<i>Either they told him</i>
<i>they'd close down the plotters...</i>

2162
02:08:41,695 --> 02:08:43,095
<i>...or simulate an attack...</i>

2163
02:08:43,176 --> 02:08:45,451
...on Kennedy to whip up public opinion...

2164
02:08:45,536 --> 02:08:48,891
...so Kennedy would have to reverse
his policies on communism.

2165
02:08:49,376 --> 02:08:51,445
<i>What they told him doesn't matter.</i>

2166
02:08:51,975 --> 02:08:53,408
<i>He was under orders.</i>

2167
02:08:53,576 --> 02:08:55,328
<i>He was a foot soldier.</i>

2168
02:08:57,735 --> 02:09:00,203
You can't miss. He is a dead duck.

2169
02:09:01,695 --> 02:09:02,923
<i>I don't buy it.</i>

2170
02:09:03,176 --> 02:09:05,087
Why would the FBI cover it up?

2171
02:09:05,376 --> 02:09:08,970
A telex disappears from every FBI office
in this country?

2172
02:09:09,536 --> 02:09:11,015
There's a word, Bill.

2173
02:09:11,176 --> 02:09:13,087
-Orders.
-Or a cover-up.

2174
02:09:14,176 --> 02:09:17,009
Don't you have enough proof
of the FBI's complicity yet?

2175
02:09:17,095 --> 02:09:19,326
I respect this country's institutions!

2176
02:09:21,496 --> 02:09:24,373
How the hell can you keep
a conspiracy going...

2177
02:09:25,055 --> 02:09:29,253
...between the mob, CIA, FBl, Army
Intelligence and who knows what else...

2178
02:09:29,695 --> 02:09:33,404
...when you can't keep a secret
in this room between 12 people?

2179
02:09:33,576 --> 02:09:35,532
I mean, we got leaks everywhere.

2180
02:09:35,615 --> 02:09:37,810
We are going to trial, y'all!

2181
02:09:38,376 --> 02:09:40,445
What the hell do we really got?

2182
02:09:40,615 --> 02:09:43,448
Oswald, Ruby, Banister
and Ferrie are dead.

2183
02:09:44,136 --> 02:09:46,774
Maybe Shaw is an agent. I don't know.

2184
02:09:46,975 --> 02:09:48,533
But as a covert operator...

2185
02:09:48,615 --> 02:09:52,006
...he is wide open for blackmail
because of his homosexuality.

2186
02:09:52,095 --> 02:09:55,805
Shaw's our toehold.
I don't know or care exactly how he fits.

2187
02:09:56,296 --> 02:09:59,332
But he's lying through his teeth.
I won't let go of him.

2188
02:09:59,496 --> 02:10:02,135
That's why you're going to trial
against Clay Shaw?

2189
02:10:02,216 --> 02:10:03,694
You will lose!

2190
02:10:03,975 --> 02:10:06,649
We should investigate
our Mafia leads here.

2191
02:10:06,815 --> 02:10:09,887
I can buy that easier
than I can the government.

2192
02:10:11,015 --> 02:10:13,849
Ruby is all mob, knows Oswald,
sets him up.

2193
02:10:15,136 --> 02:10:18,970
Hoffa, Trafficante, Marcello,
they hire some guns and do Kennedy.

2194
02:10:19,296 --> 02:10:22,685
The government doesn't want
to open up a whole can of worms...

2195
02:10:22,855 --> 02:10:25,972
...because it used the mob
to try to get Castro.

2196
02:10:26,216 --> 02:10:29,173
Castro being assassinated
by the mob by us...

2197
02:10:29,735 --> 02:10:31,805
...sounds wild to John Q. Citizen.

2198
02:10:31,975 --> 02:10:34,206
So they close the book on JFK.

2199
02:10:35,735 --> 02:10:37,293
Makes perfect sense to me.

2200
02:10:37,376 --> 02:10:40,253
I don't doubt their involvement
at a low level.

2201
02:10:40,775 --> 02:10:43,051
Could the mob change the parade route?

2202
02:10:43,336 --> 02:10:46,213
Or eliminate the protection
for the President?

2203
02:10:46,376 --> 02:10:49,573
Could the mob send Oswald to Russia
and get him back?

2204
02:10:49,735 --> 02:10:54,127
Get the FBl, the CIA and the Dallas Police
to mess up the investigation?

2205
02:10:54,336 --> 02:10:57,533
Get the Warren Commission appointed
to cover it up?

2206
02:10:58,015 --> 02:11:01,975
Wreck the autopsy? Influence
the national media to go to sleep?

2207
02:11:02,496 --> 02:11:06,011
Since when has the mob used anything
but .38's for hits up close?

2208
02:11:07,496 --> 02:11:11,569
The mob wouldn't have the guts or
the power for something of this magnitude.

2209
02:11:11,775 --> 02:11:13,731
Assassins need payrolls...

2210
02:11:14,216 --> 02:11:16,207
...schedules, times, orders.

2211
02:11:17,095 --> 02:11:19,484
This was a military-style ambush.

2212
02:11:19,815 --> 02:11:23,171
A <i>coup d'tat</i> with Lyndon Johnson
waiting in the wings.

2213
02:11:23,456 --> 02:11:27,085
You're saying Lyndon Johnson
was involved? The President?

2214
02:11:27,615 --> 02:11:30,846
Johnson got $1 billion for his friends,
Brown and Root...

2215
02:11:31,015 --> 02:11:33,246
...to dredge Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam.

2216
02:11:33,536 --> 02:11:36,573
Boss, are you calling the President
a murderer?

2217
02:11:36,735 --> 02:11:40,251
If I'm so far from the truth,
why is the FBI bugging our offices?

2218
02:11:40,416 --> 02:11:43,088
Why are witnesses being bought off
and murdered?

2219
02:11:43,176 --> 02:11:46,645
Why are federal agencies blocking
our extraditions and subpoenas?

2220
02:11:46,815 --> 02:11:48,248
I don't know.

2221
02:11:48,576 --> 02:11:51,453
Maybe there's some rogue element
in the government.

2222
02:11:51,615 --> 02:11:53,685
With a full-blown cover-up?

2223
02:11:55,015 --> 02:11:56,926
You ever read Shakespeare?

2224
02:11:59,456 --> 02:12:00,570
I do.

2225
02:12:01,216 --> 02:12:02,694
<i>Julius Caesar</i>?

2226
02:12:03,456 --> 02:12:06,606
"Brutus and Cassius,
they too are honorable men."

2227
02:12:07,336 --> 02:12:08,927
Who killed Caesar?

2228
02:12:09,695 --> 02:12:11,606
Ten or twelve Senators.

2229
02:12:11,815 --> 02:12:13,851
All it takes is one Judas.

2230
02:12:14,536 --> 02:12:17,413
A few people on the inside. Pentagon, CIA.

2231
02:12:17,895 --> 02:12:19,568
This is Louisiana.

2232
02:12:19,975 --> 02:12:23,935
How do you know who your daddy is?
'Cause your mama told you so.

2233
02:12:25,095 --> 02:12:27,326
You are taking a crap in the wind.

2234
02:12:27,655 --> 02:12:30,250
And I am not going along on this one.

2235
02:12:40,256 --> 02:12:42,975
I've had my doubts all along about Bill.

2236
02:12:43,496 --> 02:12:45,327
He's been fighting us.

2237
02:12:46,815 --> 02:12:48,135
We need him back.

2238
02:12:48,296 --> 02:12:50,490
He wasted a month trying to prove...

2239
02:12:50,655 --> 02:12:54,171
...that mob boys like Jack Ruby
are hooked up with Hunt Oil.

2240
02:12:54,336 --> 02:12:56,530
-I don't trust him.
-I will not hear this.

2241
02:12:56,615 --> 02:12:59,368
I value Bill as much as any person here.

2242
02:13:00,615 --> 02:13:04,449
It's time we made room
for someone else's ideas, including me.

2243
02:13:05,695 --> 02:13:08,573
Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is,
and I'm...

2244
02:13:09,095 --> 02:13:10,926
...just plain dumb about it.

2245
02:13:11,015 --> 02:13:13,654
I've seen him copying files here
late at night.

2246
02:13:13,735 --> 02:13:16,296
-I don't trust him.
-Did you two hear me?

2247
02:13:16,456 --> 02:13:18,685
I won't tolerate staff infighting.

2248
02:13:18,855 --> 02:13:22,052
I'm afraid I cannot work
with Bill Broussard anymore.

2249
02:13:23,296 --> 02:13:24,887
Is this an ultimatum?

2250
02:13:26,496 --> 02:13:28,213
Are you giving me an ultimatum?

2251
02:13:28,296 --> 02:13:30,412
If that's what you want to call it.

2252
02:13:32,456 --> 02:13:34,525
I never thought it'd come to this.

2253
02:13:38,015 --> 02:13:39,210
I guess I am.

2254
02:13:40,456 --> 02:13:44,846
I won't have any ultimatum put to me, Lou.
I'll accept your resignation.

2255
02:13:48,895 --> 02:13:50,375
You sure got it.

2256
02:13:55,496 --> 02:13:58,010
You are one stubborn son of a bitch.

2257
02:14:00,256 --> 02:14:02,087
You're making a big mistake.

2258
02:14:09,256 --> 02:14:11,850
Boss, aren't you being a little hard?

2259
02:14:14,296 --> 02:14:15,967
No, I don't think I am.

2260
02:14:17,256 --> 02:14:18,404
Anyone else?

2261
02:14:19,095 --> 02:14:23,009
<i>With 53% of the precincts reporting,</i>
<i>Sen. Kennedy has a 48% to 41% lead...</i>

02:14:23,695 --> 02:14:25,175

<i>Senator Kennedy has been shot!</i>

2274
02:15:56,136 --> 02:15:57,728
They killed him, honey.

2275
02:16:00,216 --> 02:16:01,489
He won...

2276
02:16:01,815 --> 02:16:04,046
...and they killed Robert Kennedy.

2277
02:16:05,975 --> 02:16:07,408
They shot him down.

2278
02:16:09,576 --> 02:16:10,929
Oh, my God!

2279
02:16:13,576 --> 02:16:14,929
Both of them?

2280
02:16:15,735 --> 02:16:17,215
Both brothers?

2281
02:16:22,376 --> 02:16:23,809
You were right.

2282
02:16:25,735 --> 02:16:27,488
It hasn't ended yet.

2283
02:16:34,856 --> 02:16:36,529
For the first time...

2284
02:16:38,136 --> 02:16:40,046
...I feel really scared.

2285
02:16:52,056 --> 02:16:54,289
I wish I could've loved you more.

2286
02:16:57,175 --> 02:17:00,212
Sometimes I feel like
I didn't ever love you...

2287
02:17:02,618 --> 02:17:04,530
...or the children enough.

2288
02:17:06,458 --> 02:17:07,729
I'm sorry.

2289
02:17:49,659 --> 02:17:50,930
Please rise.

2290
02:17:53,095 --> 02:17:57,726
The Criminal District Court for Orleans
Parish, Section H, is now in session.

2291
02:17:58,136 --> 02:18:01,969
Honorable Judge Edward A. Haggerty, Jr.
presiding. Be seated.

2292
02:18:07,056 --> 02:18:08,537
That's Clay Bertrand.

2293
02:18:08,618 --> 02:18:10,496
That's who I saw at Ferrie's.

2294
02:18:10,618 --> 02:18:12,371
That's who you say you saw.

2295
02:18:13,498 --> 02:18:15,087
<i>A confessed homosexual.</i>

2296
02:18:16,216 --> 02:18:18,493
Convicted of pandering and soliciting.

2297
02:18:19,255 --> 02:18:21,489
A man who has lied about everything...

2298
02:18:21,976 --> 02:18:24,697
...and now wants to be taken at his word.

2299
02:18:25,095 --> 02:18:27,408
That man, right there. Yes, sir.

2300
02:18:27,659 --> 02:18:29,886
He was at the Pontchartrain wall...

2301
02:18:30,376 --> 02:18:32,684
...with the man who shot the President.

2302
02:18:33,659 --> 02:18:35,886
I remember him because of his limp.

2303
02:18:36,136 --> 02:18:38,933
A heroin addict injecting himself
at the wall.

2304
02:18:39,255 --> 02:18:41,249
Barely conscious of his surroundings.

2305
02:18:41,335 --> 02:18:43,694
It's fair to say you could be mistaken.

2306
02:18:43,819 --> 02:18:45,886
Just a figment of my imagination.

2307
02:18:46,056 --> 02:18:48,414
The cat's stewing you, I told him.

2308
02:18:48,698 --> 02:18:51,452
You got the right ta-ta,
but the wrong ho-ho.

2309
02:18:51,739 --> 02:18:55,333
Bertrand is not Shaw, scout's honor.
And you can tell him I said so.

2310
02:18:55,416 --> 02:18:56,373
Objection, Your Honor!

2311
02:18:56,458 --> 02:18:59,734
Andrews has been convicted of perjury
on this matter.

2312
02:18:59,976 --> 02:19:02,333
Exception taken. That case is on appeal.

2313
02:19:02,416 --> 02:19:06,536
Your Honor, we call Police Officer
Aloysius Habighorst to the stand.

2314
02:19:07,056 --> 02:19:09,447
I must ask the jury to leave the court.

2315
02:19:12,819 --> 02:19:14,807
-Name?
-Clay LaVerne Shaw.

2316
02:19:15,175 --> 02:19:17,006
Defendant didn't have his lawyer present.

2317
02:19:17,095 --> 02:19:19,974
It's standard booking procedure
to ask an alias!

2318
02:19:20,095 --> 02:19:21,578
I call them as I see them!

2319
02:19:21,659 --> 02:19:22,850
Any aliases?

2320
02:19:22,976 --> 02:19:24,331
Clay Bertrand.

2321
02:19:25,935 --> 02:19:29,568
It's not constitutionally required
that a lawyer be present!

2322
02:19:30,578 --> 02:19:33,456
-I'm ruling that inadmissible!
-That's our case!

2323
02:19:33,618 --> 02:19:35,765
Then you didn't have a case.

2324
02:19:36,296 --> 02:19:39,093
I wouldn't believe anything
Habighorst said anyway.

2325
02:19:39,175 --> 02:19:41,131
I can't believe you're saying this!

2326
02:19:41,216 --> 02:19:43,368
I am saying it. Bring in the jury.

2327
02:19:47,296 --> 02:19:49,208
-Oswald?
-No, I did not.

2328
02:19:50,618 --> 02:19:53,291
-Ever call Dean Andrews?
-No, I did not.

2329
02:19:54,858 --> 02:19:57,130
Have you ever met David Ferrie?

2330
02:19:58,458 --> 02:20:02,130
Wouldn't even know what he looked like
if I hadn't seen pictures.

2331
02:20:03,136 --> 02:20:05,603
Did you ever use the alias, Clay Bertrand?

2332
02:20:05,739 --> 02:20:07,215
No, I did not.

2333
02:20:08,778 --> 02:20:10,531
Thank you, Mr. Shaw.

2334
02:20:13,578 --> 02:20:16,727
A very great actor has just given us
a great performance.

2335
02:20:17,056 --> 02:20:19,414
But we are nowhere closer to the truth.

2336
02:20:19,935 --> 02:20:23,453
My office is charging Clay Shaw
with outright perjury...

2337
02:20:23,935 --> 02:20:27,614
...on 15 answers he's given today,
not one word being true.

2338
02:20:28,255 --> 02:20:30,693
You're out of order! Now, sit down!

2339
02:20:30,976 --> 02:20:32,775
That's the man right there.

2340
02:20:39,458 --> 02:20:42,496
To prove there was a conspiracy
involving Clay Shaw...

2341
02:20:42,976 --> 02:20:47,128
...we must prove there was more than
one man involved in the assassination.

2342
02:20:47,858 --> 02:20:49,049
To do that...

2343
02:20:49,175 --> 02:20:52,649
...we must look at the Zapruder film
which my office subpoenaed.

2344
02:20:53,056 --> 02:20:55,526
The American public has not seen...

2345
02:20:57,216 --> 02:21:01,686
...has not seen the film. It's been locked
in a vault the last five years...

2346
02:21:03,175 --> 02:21:05,613
...in the Time-Life Building in New York.

2347
02:21:06,296 --> 02:21:08,048
There's a reason for that.

2348
02:21:09,056 --> 02:21:09,966
Watch.

2349
02:21:58,416 --> 02:22:00,649
"The picture speaks 1,000 words."

2350
02:22:02,498 --> 02:22:05,331
The Warren Commission thought they had
an open-and-shut case.

2351
02:22:05,416 --> 02:22:07,454
Three bullets, one assassin.

2352
02:22:08,255 --> 02:22:12,695
But two unpredictable things happened
that day to make it virtually impossible.

2353
02:22:12,899 --> 02:22:17,495
<i>One, the film shot by Abraham Zapruder</i>
<i>while standing near the grassy knoll.</i>

2354
02:22:17,618 --> 02:22:21,373
Two, the third wounded man,
James Teague, nicked by a fragment...

2355
02:22:21,976 --> 02:22:24,539
<i>...while standing near the triple underpass.</i>

2356
02:22:24,698 --> 02:22:28,085
The time frame, 5.6 seconds,
established by the Zapruder film...

2357
02:22:28,175 --> 02:22:30,770
...left no possibility of a fourth shot.

2358
02:22:30,976 --> 02:22:35,291
So the shot of fragment that left
a superficial wound on Teague's cheek...

2359
02:22:35,458 --> 02:22:39,611
...came from one of the three bullets
fired from the Depository's sixth floor.

2360
02:22:40,255 --> 02:22:42,132
That leaves just two bullets.

2361
02:22:42,335 --> 02:22:45,851
We know one was the fatal head shot
that killed Kennedy.

2362
02:22:47,539 --> 02:22:49,291
So a single bullet remains.

2363
02:22:49,539 --> 02:22:53,817
A single bullet must account for the seven
wounds in Kennedy and Connally.

2364
02:22:54,935 --> 02:22:58,007
Rather than admit to a conspiracy
or investigate further...

2365
02:22:58,095 --> 02:23:00,613
...the Warren Commission
endorsed the theory...

2366
02:23:00,698 --> 02:23:03,657
...put forth by an ambitious attorney,
Arlen Spector.

2367
02:23:03,858 --> 02:23:07,166
One of the grossest lies ever forced
on the American people.

2368
02:23:08,498 --> 02:23:10,885
It's known as the "magic bullet" theory.

2369
02:23:11,618 --> 02:23:13,049
The magic bullet...

2370
02:23:13,216 --> 02:23:17,451
...enters the President's back,
headed downward at a 17-degree angle.

2371
02:23:17,976 --> 02:23:22,530
It then moves upwards to leave Kennedy's
body from the front of his neck...

2372
02:23:22,976 --> 02:23:24,457
...wound #2...

2373
02:23:24,899 --> 02:23:27,207
...where it waits 1.6 seconds...

2374
02:23:27,578 --> 02:23:31,251
...presumably in midair,
where it turns right, then left...

2375
02:23:31,899 --> 02:23:33,727
...right, then left...

2376
02:23:34,136 --> 02:23:37,128
...and continues
into Connally's right armpit.

2377
02:23:37,698 --> 02:23:38,969
Wound #3.

2378
02:23:39,618 --> 02:23:44,166
The bullet then heads down at an angle
of 27 degrees, shattering his rib...

2379
02:23:44,899 --> 02:23:48,573
...and exiting from the right side
of his chest. Wound #4.

2380
02:23:49,216 --> 02:23:53,497
The bullet turns right, reentering
Connally's body at his right wrist.

2381
02:23:54,458 --> 02:23:55,729
Wound #5.

2382
02:23:56,376 --> 02:23:58,290
Shattering the radius bone...

2383
02:23:58,498 --> 02:24:01,250
...the bullet exits Connally's wrist,
wound #6...

2384
02:24:01,539 --> 02:24:05,926
...makes a dramatic U-turn,
then buries itself in Connally's left thigh.

2385
02:24:06,255 --> 02:24:09,088
Wound #7, from which it later falls out...

2386
02:24:09,659 --> 02:24:12,411
...and is found
in almost pristine condition...

2387
02:24:12,698 --> 02:24:15,611
<i>...on a stretcher in a corridor</i>
<i>of Parkland Hospital.</i>

2388
02:24:17,976 --> 02:24:19,375
Some bullet.

2389
02:24:21,056 --> 02:24:24,128
Any combat vet can tell you,
never in the history of gunfire...

2390
02:24:24,216 --> 02:24:26,778
...has there been a bullet this ridiculous.

2391
02:24:27,618 --> 02:24:32,248
The government says it can prove it
with some fancy physics in a nuclear lab.

2392
02:24:32,578 --> 02:24:34,167
Of course they can.

2393
02:24:34,458 --> 02:24:37,576
Theoretical physics can prove
an elephant can hang from a cliff...

2394
02:24:37,659 --> 02:24:39,775
...with his tail tied to a daisy.

2395
02:24:40,416 --> 02:24:43,010
But use your eyes, your common sense.

2396
02:24:43,416 --> 02:24:47,375
The Army wound ballistics experts
fired some comparison bullets.

2397
02:24:47,935 --> 02:24:50,498
Not one of them looked anything like this.

2398
02:24:51,335 --> 02:24:52,927
Take a look at CE-856.

2399
02:24:54,899 --> 02:24:56,490
An identical bullet...

2400
02:24:56,899 --> 02:24:59,617
...fired through the wrist
of a human cadaver...

2401
02:24:59,935 --> 02:25:03,132
...just one of the bones smashed
by the magic bullet.

2402
02:25:03,858 --> 02:25:05,611
Seven wounds, gentlemen.

2403
02:25:06,056 --> 02:25:07,332
Tough skin...

2404
02:25:07,618 --> 02:25:09,129
...dense bones.

2405
02:25:10,175 --> 02:25:12,328
This single-bullet explanation...

2406
02:25:12,498 --> 02:25:16,491
...is the foundation of the Warren
Commission's claim of one assassin.

2407
02:25:16,819 --> 02:25:18,410
And once you conclude...

2408
02:25:18,578 --> 02:25:21,456
...the magic bullet couldn't create
all seven wounds...

2409
02:25:21,539 --> 02:25:25,373
...you must conclude there was
a fourth shot and a second rifleman.

2410
02:25:26,659 --> 02:25:28,886
And if there was a second rifleman...

2411
02:25:29,416 --> 02:25:32,615
...then by definition there had
to be a conspiracy...

2412
02:25:32,899 --> 02:25:36,013
...which we believe
involves the accused, Clay Shaw.

2413
02:25:36,899 --> 02:25:40,729
Fifty-one witnesses thought
they heard shots from the grassy knoll...

2414
02:25:42,015 --> 02:25:45,212
...which is to the right,
in front of the President.

2415
02:25:46,416 --> 02:25:48,087
Key witnesses that day?

2416
02:25:48,416 --> 02:25:50,569
Charles Brehm, a combat vet.

2417
02:25:51,935 --> 02:25:54,005
Jean Hill and Mary Moorman.

2418
02:25:54,335 --> 02:25:56,899
S. M. Holland, Richard Dodd,
James Simmons...

2419
02:25:57,416 --> 02:25:59,694
<i>...standing on the overpass. J.C. Price...</i>

2420
02:25:59,778 --> 02:26:01,451
<i>...overlooking the plaza.</i>

2421
02:26:02,175 --> 02:26:04,488
<i>William Newman, father of two children.</i>

2422
02:26:04,976 --> 02:26:07,412
He hit the deck on the north side of Elm.

2423
02:26:08,899 --> 02:26:10,490
Abraham Zapruder.

2424
02:26:26,255 --> 02:26:29,213
Each of these key witnesses
has no doubt whatsoever...

2425
02:26:29,376 --> 02:26:32,416
<i>...one or more shots came</i>
<i>from behind the picket fence.</i>

2426
02:26:34,739 --> 02:26:36,886
Twenty-six trained medical personnel
at Parkland Hospital...

2427
02:26:36,976 --> 02:26:40,289
...saw the back of the President's head
blasted out!

2428
02:26:42,335 --> 02:26:43,818
Doctor Peters.

2429
02:26:44,416 --> 02:26:48,570
There was a large 7-cm opening
at the right occipital parietal area.

2430
02:26:48,976 --> 02:26:51,776
<i>A considerable portion</i>
<i>of the brain was missing.</i>

2431
02:26:53,458 --> 02:26:58,085
A fifth or possibly a quarter of the back
of the head had been blasted out...

2432
02:26:58,255 --> 02:27:00,724
<i>...along with the underlying brain tissue.</i>

2433
02:27:00,819 --> 02:27:03,286
When's the proper time
to declare one dead?

2434
02:27:03,376 --> 02:27:07,291
<i>There was also a large fragment of skull</i>
<i>attached to a flap of the scalp.</i>

2435
02:27:07,376 --> 02:27:11,209
<i>The exit hole in the rear of his head</i>
<i>measured about 120 mm...</i>

2436
02:27:11,458 --> 02:27:13,048
<i>...or five inches, across.</i>

2437
02:27:13,136 --> 02:27:16,924
<i>Not one of the civilian doctors</i>
<i>who examined the President...</i>

2438
02:27:17,216 --> 02:27:20,528
<i>...regarded his throat wound as anything</i>
<i>but an entry wound.</i>

2439
02:27:21,216 --> 02:27:24,655
But then the body was illegally moved
to Washington for the autopsy.

2440
02:27:24,739 --> 02:27:26,886
<i>Because when a</i> coup d'tat <i>has occurred...</i>

2441
02:27:26,976 --> 02:27:31,208
<i>...there's a big difference between</i>
<i>an autopsy performed by civilian doctors...</i>

2442
02:27:31,296 --> 02:27:34,734
<i>...and one that is performed</i>
<i>by military doctors under orders.</i>

2443
02:27:35,858 --> 02:27:40,007
<i>The departure of Air Force One, Friday</i>
<i>afternoon was not so much a takeoff...</i>

2444
02:27:40,095 --> 02:27:43,694
<i>...as it was a getaway,</i>
<i>with the newly sworn in President.</i>

2445
02:27:43,858 --> 02:27:45,049
<i>Objection!</i>

2446
02:27:45,216 --> 02:27:46,251
Sustained.

2447
02:27:46,416 --> 02:27:50,331
On the plane, the White House Situation
Room announced Oswald's guilt...

2448
02:27:50,498 --> 02:27:54,411
...to all passengers before any kind
of investigation had begun.

2449
02:27:54,659 --> 02:27:57,456
The "angry lone nut" solution
is beginning to take shape.

2450
02:27:57,539 --> 02:27:59,969
-Objection, Your Honor.
-Sustained.

2451
02:28:01,698 --> 02:28:03,371
Please bottle the acid.

2452
02:28:05,376 --> 02:28:10,005
<i>The three Bethesda doctors picked by</i>
<i>the military left something to be desired.</i>

2453
02:28:10,175 --> 02:28:13,649
<i>None of them had experience</i>
<i>with combat</i>-<i>gunfire wounds.</i>

2454
02:28:14,056 --> 02:28:18,416
<i>Through their autopsy, we've been able</i>
<i>to justify eight wounds from two bullets.</i>

2455
02:28:18,659 --> 02:28:20,965
<i>Three to Kennedy, five to Connally.</i>

2456
02:28:21,216 --> 02:28:23,448
<i>One of them being the "magic bullet."</i>

2457
02:28:23,539 --> 02:28:24,809
-FBI?
-Here.

2458
02:28:25,056 --> 02:28:28,733
Col. Finck, are you saying someone
told you not to dissect the neck?

2459
02:28:28,899 --> 02:28:32,047
I was told the family wanted
the examination of the head.

2460
02:28:32,335 --> 02:28:33,533
Oh, Christ.

2461
02:28:33,698 --> 02:28:35,371
Looks like half his brain is gone.

2462
02:28:35,458 --> 02:28:37,174
-Weigh it.
-653 grams.

2463
02:28:37,858 --> 02:28:40,893
<i>As a pathologist, it was your obligation</i>
<i>to explore...</i>

2464
02:28:41,056 --> 02:28:42,887
<i>...all possible causes of death.</i>

2465
02:28:42,976 --> 02:28:44,491
I had the cause of death.

2466
02:28:44,578 --> 02:28:48,091
Your Honor, please direct the witness
to answer my question.

2467
02:28:48,578 --> 02:28:51,695
Why did Colonel Finck not dissect
the tract of the bullet wound?

2468
02:28:51,778 --> 02:28:53,686
<i>I heard Dr. Humes stating....</i>

2469
02:28:53,935 --> 02:28:55,926
That's enough. That's enough.

2470
02:28:56,255 --> 02:28:57,612
It's duly noted.

2471
02:28:57,858 --> 02:28:59,656
Let's check the back.

2472
02:29:06,819 --> 02:29:09,537
I can feel the end of the wound
with my finger.

2473
02:29:09,618 --> 02:29:11,450
That won't be necessary.

2474
02:29:13,858 --> 02:29:15,334
Watch the ear!

2475
02:29:16,498 --> 02:29:18,726
Shot in the back. Cheap crime.

2476
02:29:19,216 --> 02:29:20,171
<i>He said:</i>

2477
02:29:20,335 --> 02:29:22,087
Who's in charge here?

2478
02:29:22,498 --> 02:29:23,534
I am.

2479
02:29:24,498 --> 02:29:26,213
<i>I don't remember his name.</i>

2480
02:29:26,659 --> 02:29:28,330
It was quite crowded.

2481
02:29:28,498 --> 02:29:32,091
<i>And when you are called to look</i>
<i>at the wounds of the dead President...</i>

2482
02:29:32,175 --> 02:29:35,329
<i>...you don't ask people for their names</i>
<i>and who they are.</i>

2483
02:29:35,778 --> 02:29:39,453
<i>But you were a qualified pathologist.</i>
<i>Was the Army General?</i>

2484
02:29:39,739 --> 02:29:40,534
<i>No.</i>

2485
02:29:41,376 --> 02:29:43,013
<i>But you took his orders.</i>

2486
02:29:43,498 --> 02:29:44,328
Yes.

2487
02:29:44,539 --> 02:29:46,844
-So he was directing the autopsy.
-No.

2488
02:29:46,976 --> 02:29:48,570
There were others.

2489
02:29:49,698 --> 02:29:51,451
There were admirals.

2490
02:29:52,498 --> 02:29:55,806
When you're a Lieutenant Colonel,
you follow orders.

2491
02:29:56,255 --> 02:30:00,490
It is not our business to discuss this
with anyone outside this room.

2492
02:30:01,056 --> 02:30:03,933
As I recall, Admiral Kenney,
Navy Surgeon General...

2493
02:30:04,015 --> 02:30:07,132
<i>...specifically told us</i>
<i>not to discuss the case.</i>

2494
02:30:09,778 --> 02:30:12,926
A lot of people were deciding
what was private...

2495
02:30:13,216 --> 02:30:15,683
...none of the American people's business.

2496
02:30:15,858 --> 02:30:18,085
The chief pathologist, Commander Humes...

2497
02:30:18,175 --> 02:30:21,534
...by his own admission,
voluntarily burned his autopsy notes.

2498
02:30:21,778 --> 02:30:24,247
President Johnson orders
the blood-soaked limousine...

2499
02:30:24,335 --> 02:30:27,775
<i>...filled with bullet holes and clues</i>
<i>to be washed and rebuilt.</i>

2500
02:30:28,095 --> 02:30:30,818
He sends Connally's bloody suit
to the cleaners.

2501
02:30:31,935 --> 02:30:36,250
The Justice Department denied this office
access to the autopsy photos.

2502
02:30:36,899 --> 02:30:40,808
When we finally get a court order
to examine Kennedy's brain...

2503
02:30:41,539 --> 02:30:44,736
...in the hopes of finding
from which direction the bullet came...

2504
02:30:44,819 --> 02:30:46,090
...we're told...

2505
02:30:46,899 --> 02:30:50,729
...by your government that
the President's brain has disappeared.

2506
02:30:54,015 --> 02:30:57,614
That's not all that's disappeared.
With it, the concept of justice.

2507
02:30:57,698 --> 02:31:01,533
Objection. Mr. Garrison is insulting
the federal government--

2508
02:31:02,778 --> 02:31:04,094
Overruled!

2509
02:31:10,899 --> 02:31:13,126
So, what really happened that day?

2510
02:31:13,539 --> 02:31:16,174
Let's just for a moment speculate,
shall we?

2511
02:31:16,578 --> 02:31:18,649
We have the epileptic seizure...

2512
02:31:18,899 --> 02:31:22,968
<i>...distracting the police and allowing</i>
<i>the shooters to get into place.</i>

2513
02:31:24,175 --> 02:31:28,088
<i>The epileptic later vanished,</i>
<i>never checking into the hospital.</i>

2514
02:31:29,216 --> 02:31:32,174
<i>The A</i>-<i>team goes to the sixth floor</i>
<i>of the Depository.</i>

2515
02:31:32,335 --> 02:31:35,375
<i>They were refurbishing the floors</i>
<i>of the Depository that week...</i>

2516
02:31:35,458 --> 02:31:37,969
<i>...allowing unknown workmen</i>
<i>in the building.</i>

2517
02:31:38,739 --> 02:31:42,492
<i>They move quickly into position,</i>
<i>minutes before the shooting.</i>

2518
02:31:42,739 --> 02:31:47,127
<i>The second spotter, talking by radio to</i>
<i>the other teams, has the best overall view.</i>

2519
02:31:47,539 --> 02:31:48,729
<i>The God spot.</i>

2520
02:31:49,216 --> 02:31:53,334
<i>B</i>-<i>team, one rifleman and one spotter</i>
<i>with access to the building...</i>

2521
02:31:53,935 --> 02:31:56,972
<i>...moves into a low floor</i>
<i>of the Dal</i>-<i>Tex building.</i>

2522
02:31:57,698 --> 02:32:02,249
<i>The third team, C</i>-<i>team, moves in</i>
<i>behind the fence above the grassy knoll...</i>

2523
02:32:02,578 --> 02:32:06,808
<i>...where the shooter and the spotter</i>
<i>are first seen by the late Lee Bowers.</i>

2524
02:32:07,698 --> 02:32:09,609
<i>They have the best position.</i>

2525
02:32:10,175 --> 02:32:13,167
<i>Kennedy is close and on a flat,</i>
<i>low trajectory.</i>

2526
02:32:13,935 --> 02:32:15,611
<i>Part of this team is a coordinator...</i>

2527
02:32:15,698 --> 02:32:19,847
<i>...who flashed security credentials</i>
<i>at people, chasing them from the area.</i>

2528
02:32:20,899 --> 02:32:23,617
<i>Probably two to three more men</i>
<i>are in the crowd.</i>

2529
02:32:25,056 --> 02:32:27,888
<i>Ten to twelve men.</i>
<i>Three teams. Three shooters.</i>

2530
02:32:28,819 --> 02:32:33,290
<i>The triangulation of fire Clay Shaw and</i>
<i>David Ferrie discussed two months before.</i>

2531
02:32:34,416 --> 02:32:36,167
<i>They blocked the plaza.</i>

2532
02:32:36,335 --> 02:32:38,054
<i>They know every inch.</i>

2533
02:32:40,255 --> 02:32:43,851
<i>They've calibrated their sights.</i>
<i>Practiced on moving targets.</i>

2534
02:32:44,578 --> 02:32:45,770
<i>They're ready.</i>

2535
02:32:46,739 --> 02:32:50,251
<i>Kennedy's motorcade makes a turn</i>
<i>from Main onto Houston.</i>

2536
02:32:50,659 --> 02:32:52,650
<i>It's going to be a turkey shoot.</i>

2537
02:32:54,255 --> 02:32:56,249
<i>They don't shoot him on Houston...</i>

2538
02:32:56,335 --> 02:32:59,569
<i>...the easiest shot for a single shooter</i>
<i>in the Depository.</i>

2539
02:32:59,935 --> 02:33:03,614
<i>They wait till he gets to the killing zone</i>
<i>between three rifles.</i>

2540
02:33:04,739 --> 02:33:07,696
<i>Kennedy makes the turn</i>
<i>from Houston onto Elm.</i>

2541
02:33:08,498 --> 02:33:11,135
<i>Slowing down to some 11 miles an hour.</i>

2542
02:33:12,416 --> 02:33:16,091
<i>The shooters across Dealey Plaza tighten,</i>
<i>taking their aim.</i>

2543
02:33:17,935 --> 02:33:20,927
<i>Waiting for the radio to say,</i>
<i>"Green! Green!"</i>

2544
02:33:21,858 --> 02:33:23,611
<i>Or, "Abort! Abort!"</i>

2545
02:33:30,095 --> 02:33:31,768
<i>The first shot rings out.</i>

2546
02:33:32,659 --> 02:33:35,695
<i>Sounding like a backfire,</i>
<i>it misses the car completely.</i>

2547
02:33:36,498 --> 02:33:39,456
Frame 161, Kennedy stops waving
as he hears something.

2548
02:33:39,778 --> 02:33:42,335
<i>Connally's head turns slightly to the right.</i>

2549
02:33:42,578 --> 02:33:46,332
<i>Frame 193, the second shot hits Kennedy</i>
<i>in the throat from the front.</i>

2550
02:33:46,976 --> 02:33:50,173
<i>Frame 225, Kennedy emerges</i>
<i>from behind the road sign.</i>

2551
02:33:50,498 --> 02:33:53,535
<i>He's been hit, raising his hands</i>
<i>to his throat.</i>

2552
02:33:54,416 --> 02:33:56,569
<i>The third shot, frame 232...</i>

2553
02:33:57,296 --> 02:34:00,496
<i>...hits Kennedy in the back,</i>
<i>pulling him downward and forward.</i>

2554
02:34:00,578 --> 02:34:03,615
<i>Connally, you will notice,</i>
<i>shows no sign of being hit.</i>

2555
02:34:03,858 --> 02:34:07,929
<i>He is holding his Stetson, which is</i>
<i>impossible if his wrist is shattered.</i>

2556
02:34:08,095 --> 02:34:09,847
<i>Connally is turning now.</i>

2557
02:34:10,015 --> 02:34:11,846
Frame 238. The fourth shot.

2558
02:34:12,095 --> 02:34:15,249
<i>It misses Kennedy and takes Connally</i>
<i>in the back.</i>

2559
02:34:15,539 --> 02:34:18,416
<i>This is the shot that proves</i>
<i>there were two rifles.</i>

2560
02:34:18,578 --> 02:34:21,932
<i>Connally yells, "My God!</i>
<i>They're going to kill us all!"</i>

2561
02:34:22,015 --> 02:34:25,249
<i>Around this time, another shot</i>
<i>misses the car completely...</i>

2562
02:34:25,376 --> 02:34:27,843
<i>...striking James Teague by the underpass.</i>

2563
02:34:28,739 --> 02:34:29,930
<i>The car brakes.</i>

2564
02:34:30,175 --> 02:34:31,847
<i>The sixth and fatal shot.</i>

2565
02:34:32,015 --> 02:34:35,328
<i>Frame 313, takes Kennedy in the head</i>
<i>from the front.</i>

2566
02:34:36,899 --> 02:34:38,490
<i>This is the key shot.</i>

2567
02:34:38,976 --> 02:34:41,853
<i>The President going back and to his left...</i>

2568
02:34:42,255 --> 02:34:44,328
<i>...shot from the front and right.</i>

2569
02:34:45,056 --> 02:34:48,333
<i>Totally inconsistent with the shot</i>
<i>from the Depository.</i>

2570
02:34:48,498 --> 02:34:49,409
<i>Again.</i>

2571
02:34:53,458 --> 02:34:55,290
<i>Back, and to the left.</i>

2572
02:34:56,498 --> 02:34:58,250
<i>Back, and to the left.</i>

2573
02:34:59,458 --> 02:35:01,290
Back, and to the left.

2574
02:35:03,458 --> 02:35:05,208
<i>So what happens then?</i>

2575
02:35:07,618 --> 02:35:08,809
<i>Pandemonium.</i>

2576
02:35:11,539 --> 02:35:13,370
Let's go! We got him!

2577
02:35:18,858 --> 02:35:23,454
<i>The shooters quickly disassemble their</i>
<i>various weapons, except the Oswald rifle.</i>

2578
02:35:33,935 --> 02:35:37,211
<i>Patrolman Smith rushes to the parking lot</i>
<i>behind the fence.</i>

2579
02:35:37,858 --> 02:35:39,372
<i>He smells gunpowder.</i>

2580
02:35:39,539 --> 02:35:43,130
He produced credentials showing him
to be Secret Service.

2581
02:35:44,175 --> 02:35:46,739
Let's see your ID.
See anyone else up here?

2582
02:35:47,618 --> 02:35:49,890
<i>I accepted that and let him go.</i>

2583
02:35:51,216 --> 02:35:53,729
<i>I regretted it. He looked like a mechanic.</i>

2584
02:35:54,498 --> 02:35:58,491
<i>He had on a sports shirt and pants,</i>
<i>but he had dirty fingernails.</i>

2585
02:36:00,255 --> 02:36:03,134
<i>Afterward, it didn't ring true.</i>
<i>But at the time...</i>

2586
02:36:03,539 --> 02:36:05,495
...we were so pressed for time.

2587
02:36:05,935 --> 02:36:08,817
<i>All Secret Servicemen</i>
<i>in Dallas are accounted for.</i>

2588
02:36:09,778 --> 02:36:13,453
<i>None were on foot in Dealey Plaza</i>
<i>before or after the shooting...</i>

2589
02:36:13,618 --> 02:36:16,971
...till the Dallas Secret Service chief
returned at 12:55.

2590
02:36:17,458 --> 02:36:20,925
<i>The Dallas police took at least 12 people</i>
<i>into custody.</i>

2591
02:36:21,935 --> 02:36:23,611
No record of their arrest.

2592
02:36:23,698 --> 02:36:26,816
Men acting like hoboes
were pulled off trains...

2593
02:36:27,216 --> 02:36:29,604
...marched through Dealey Plaza,
photographed.

2594
02:36:29,698 --> 02:36:31,845
<i>Yet there's no record of their arrest.</i>

2595
02:36:31,935 --> 02:36:35,645
<i>Men identifying themselves</i>
<i>as Secret Service agents were everywhere.</i>

2596
02:36:36,416 --> 02:36:38,374
But who was impersonating them?

2597
02:36:38,659 --> 02:36:40,168
Where was Oswald?

2598
02:36:40,819 --> 02:36:44,013
<i>Around 12:15, leaving the building</i>
<i>to see the motorcade...</i>

2599
02:36:44,578 --> 02:36:48,012
<i>...Carolyn Arnold sees Oswald</i>
<i>in the second</i>-<i>floor snack room...</i>

2600
02:36:48,175 --> 02:36:50,328
...where he said he went for a Coke.

2601
02:36:50,819 --> 02:36:53,933
He was in a booth on the right side
of the room.

2602
02:36:54,416 --> 02:36:57,931
<i>He was by himself as usual,</i>
<i>appeared to be having lunch.</i>

2603
02:36:58,255 --> 02:37:01,134
<i>I didn't speak to him,</i>
<i>but I recognized him clearly.</i>

2604
02:37:02,416 --> 02:37:06,887
<i>At the same time, Bonnie Ray Williams is</i>
<i>supposedly eating lunch in the sixth floor.</i>

2605
02:37:07,056 --> 02:37:09,572
<i>He's there until 12:15, maybe 12:20.</i>

2606
02:37:10,095 --> 02:37:11,612
<i>He sees nobody.</i>

2607
02:37:12,015 --> 02:37:16,489
<i>Arnold Rowlands, on the street, looks up,</i>
<i>sees two men in the sixth</i>-<i>floor windows...</i>

2608
02:37:16,659 --> 02:37:20,012
<i>...presumably after Williams</i>
<i>finished his lunch and left.</i>

2609
02:37:20,335 --> 02:37:24,090
<i>John Powell, a prisoner on the sixth floor</i>
<i>of the county jail, sees them.</i>

2610
02:37:24,175 --> 02:37:25,692
<i>Many of us saw them.</i>

2611
02:37:25,858 --> 02:37:29,929
<i>Everyone was hollering and yelling.</i>
<i>We thought they was security guys.</i>

2612
02:37:30,095 --> 02:37:34,535
If Oswald was the assassin, he was
nonchalant about moving into position.

2613
02:37:35,136 --> 02:37:38,889
<i>Later, he told police he was</i>
<i>in the second</i>-<i>floor snack room.</i>

2614
02:37:39,056 --> 02:37:42,093
<i>Probably told to wait there</i>
<i>by his handler for a call.</i>

2615
02:37:43,458 --> 02:37:45,450
<i>But the phone call never came.</i>

2616
02:37:46,015 --> 02:37:48,578
<i>Maximum 90 seconds</i>
<i>after Kennedy is shot...</i>

2617
02:37:48,739 --> 02:37:52,728
<i>...Patrolman Marrion Baker sees Oswald</i>
<i>in that second</i>-<i>floor lunchroom.</i>

2618
02:37:53,858 --> 02:37:55,531
Is this man an employee?

2619
02:37:55,698 --> 02:37:58,004
Yes. The President's been shot.

2620
02:37:58,416 --> 02:38:00,725
<i>The Commission would have us believe...</i>

2621
02:38:00,899 --> 02:38:04,172
<i>...that after firing three bolt</i>-<i>action shots</i>
<i>in 5.6 seconds...</i>

2622
02:38:04,255 --> 02:38:08,650
<i>...Oswald then leaves three cartridges</i>
<i>neatly side</i>-<i>by</i>-<i>side in the firing nest...</i>

2623
02:38:08,819 --> 02:38:13,208
<i>...wipes fingerprints off the rifle,</i>
<i>stashes it on the other side of the loft...</i>

2624
02:38:14,175 --> 02:38:16,409
<i>...sprints down five flights of stairs...</i>

2625
02:38:16,498 --> 02:38:19,852
<i>...past Victoria Adams and Sandra Styles</i>
<i>who never see him...</i>

2626
02:38:20,659 --> 02:38:24,968
<i>...then shows up, cool and calm, on the</i>
<i>second floor in front of Patrolman Baker.</i>

2627
02:38:26,255 --> 02:38:29,455
<i>All this within a maximum of 90 seconds</i>
<i>of the shooting.</i>

2628
02:38:29,935 --> 02:38:31,891
Is this man an employee?

2629
02:38:32,095 --> 02:38:34,006
Yes. The President's been shot.

2630
02:38:34,095 --> 02:38:35,578
<i>Is he out of breath?</i>

2631
02:38:36,015 --> 02:38:38,487
<i>According to Baker, absolutely not.</i>

2632
02:38:38,976 --> 02:38:43,291
<i>Assuming he is the sole assassin,</i>
<i>Oswald is free to leave the building.</i>

2633
02:38:44,175 --> 02:38:48,775
<i>The longer he delays, the more chance</i>
<i>the building will be sealed by police.</i>

2634
02:38:49,216 --> 02:38:52,655
<i>Is he guilty? Does he walk</i>
<i>out the nearest staircase?</i>

2635
02:38:54,498 --> 02:38:56,134
<i>He buys a Coke...</i>

2636
02:38:56,498 --> 02:39:00,571
<i>...and at a slow pace, spotted by Mrs. Reid</i>
<i>on the second floor...</i>

2637
02:39:00,819 --> 02:39:03,537
<i>...he strolls out</i>
<i>the more distant front exit...</i>

2638
02:39:03,698 --> 02:39:05,530
<i>...where cops have gathered.</i>

2639
02:39:05,698 --> 02:39:08,334
<i>Odd, since three shots were fired</i>
<i>from there...</i>

2640
02:39:08,416 --> 02:39:11,293
<i>...nobody seals the Depository</i>
<i>for ten more minutes.</i>

2641
02:39:11,376 --> 02:39:14,174
<i>Oswald slips out,</i>
<i>as do several other employees.</i>

2642
02:39:14,416 --> 02:39:18,331
<i>When he realized something had gone</i>
<i>wrong and Kennedy had been killed...</i>

2643
02:39:18,819 --> 02:39:22,493
...he knew there was a problem.
Maybe even that he was the patsy.

2644
02:39:23,056 --> 02:39:27,174
<i>An intuition, maybe. The President killed</i>
<i>in spite of his warning.</i>

2645
02:39:27,618 --> 02:39:29,049
The phone call that never came.

2646
02:39:29,136 --> 02:39:32,415
Perhaps fear now came to Oswald
for the very first time.

2647
02:39:33,858 --> 02:39:37,291
<i>Oswald returns to his rooming house</i>
<i>around 1:00 p.m...</i>

2648
02:39:37,376 --> 02:39:39,528
<i>...a half hour after the assassination.</i>

2649
02:39:39,618 --> 02:39:41,291
A man shot the President!

2650
02:39:41,458 --> 02:39:44,334
<i>He puts on his jacket,</i>
<i>grabs his .38 revolver...</i>

2651
02:39:44,498 --> 02:39:46,329
<i>...and leaves at 1:04.</i>

2652
02:39:46,739 --> 02:39:50,572
<i>Earlene Roberts, the housekeeper,</i>
<i>heard two beeps on a car horn.</i>

2653
02:39:50,819 --> 02:39:53,571
<i>Two uniformed cops pulled up</i>
<i>while Oswald was in his room.</i>

2654
02:39:53,659 --> 02:39:55,168
<i>Like it was a signal.</i>

2655
02:39:55,858 --> 02:39:59,488
<i>Officer Tippet is shot between 1:10</i>
<i>and 1:15, a mile away.</i>

2656
02:40:00,255 --> 02:40:02,770
<i>And though no one saw him walking...</i>

2657
02:40:03,175 --> 02:40:05,693
<i>...the government says</i>
<i>Oswald covered that distance.</i>

2658
02:40:05,778 --> 02:40:08,209
<i>Giving the government the benefit</i>
<i>of the doubt...</i>

2659
02:40:08,296 --> 02:40:11,291
<i>...Oswald would've had to jog a mile</i>
<i>in six to eleven minutes...</i>

2660
02:40:11,376 --> 02:40:13,653
<i>...then commit the murder,</i>
<i>reverse his direction...</i>

2661
02:40:13,739 --> 02:40:17,046
<i>...and walk 3/5ths of a mile</i>
<i>to the Texas Theater...</i>

2662
02:40:17,136 --> 02:40:19,603
<i>...and arrive sometime before 1:30.</i>

2663
02:40:24,819 --> 02:40:26,456
<i>It's also a useful conclusion.</i>

2664
02:40:26,539 --> 02:40:29,209
<i>After all, why would Oswald</i>
<i>kill Officer Tippet...</i>

2665
02:40:29,296 --> 02:40:32,333
<i>...unless he just shot the President</i>
<i>and feared arrest?</i>

2666
02:40:32,659 --> 02:40:34,410
<i>Domingo Benevides...</i>

2667
02:40:36,095 --> 02:40:38,086
<i>...the closest witness to the shooting...</i>

2668
02:40:38,175 --> 02:40:42,250
<i>...refused to identify Oswald as the killer</i>
<i>and was never taken to a lineup.</i>

2669
02:40:42,819 --> 02:40:43,805
<i>Acquilla Clemons...</i>

2670
02:40:43,899 --> 02:40:47,333
<i>...saw the killer and another man</i>
<i>go off in separate directions.</i>

2671
02:40:47,416 --> 02:40:51,411
<i>Mrs. Clemons was never taken to a lineup</i>
<i>or to the Warren Commission.</i>

2672
02:40:51,899 --> 02:40:55,414
<i>At the scene, Officer Poe marks</i>
<i>his initials on the shells...</i>

2673
02:40:55,578 --> 02:40:57,694
<i>...to record the chain of evidence.</i>

2674
02:40:58,539 --> 02:41:01,334
<i>Those initials are not</i>
<i>on the three cartridge cases...</i>

2675
02:41:01,416 --> 02:41:03,805
<i>...which the Warren Commission show him.</i>

2676
02:41:03,976 --> 02:41:07,763
<i>As early as 12:44, only 14 minutes</i>
<i>after the assassination...</i>

2677
02:41:08,458 --> 02:41:12,691
<i>...the police put out a description</i>
<i>matching Oswald's size and build.</i>

2678
02:41:12,858 --> 02:41:17,007
<i>Oswald is next seen by a shoe salesman,</i>
<i>Johnny Brewer, on Jefferson Avenue.</i>

2679
02:41:18,296 --> 02:41:22,766
<i>Oswald is scared. He begins to realize</i>
<i>the full implications of this thing.</i>

2680
02:41:23,015 --> 02:41:26,534
<i>He goes to the Texas Theater,</i>
<i>possibly a prearranged meeting point.</i>

2681
02:41:26,618 --> 02:41:30,532
<i>Though he has $14 in his pocket,</i>
<i>he doesn't buy the</i> 7<i>5</i>-<i>cent ticket.</i>

2682
02:41:31,578 --> 02:41:34,043
<i>Brewer has the cashier call the police.</i>

2683
02:41:34,296 --> 02:41:36,368
<i>In response to that call...</i>

2684
02:41:36,539 --> 02:41:40,691
<i>...at least 30 officers in patrol cars descend</i>
<i>on the movie theater.</i>

2685
02:41:41,015 --> 02:41:44,212
<i>This is the most remarkable example</i>
<i>of police intuition...</i>

2686
02:41:44,376 --> 02:41:46,448
<i>...since the Reichstag fire.</i>

2687
02:41:47,175 --> 02:41:48,407
<i>I don't buy it!</i>

2688
02:41:48,539 --> 02:41:51,576
<i>They knew. Someone knew</i>
<i>Oswald would be there.</i>

2689
02:41:53,095 --> 02:41:55,408
<i>Brewer leads the cops into the theater...</i>

2690
02:41:55,498 --> 02:41:57,454
<i>...and from the stage, points Oswald out.</i>

2691
02:41:57,539 --> 02:41:58,684
There he is.

2692
02:42:10,539 --> 02:42:12,810
Sir, can I get you to stand up?

2693
02:42:18,458 --> 02:42:21,811
I am not resisting arrest!
I am not resisting arrest!

2694
02:42:22,935 --> 02:42:24,416
<i>They have their man.</i>

2695
02:42:25,255 --> 02:42:28,009
It's already been decided in Washington.

2696
02:42:28,778 --> 02:42:31,247
<i>When he is brought from the theater...</i>

2697
02:42:31,416 --> 02:42:33,725
<i>...a crowd is waiting to scream at him.</i>

2698
02:42:33,976 --> 02:42:37,333
<i>Lee Oswald must have felt like Joseph K.</i>
<i>in Kafka's</i> The Trial.

2699
02:42:37,416 --> 02:42:39,805
<i>He's never given reasons for his arrest.</i>

2700
02:42:39,976 --> 02:42:43,013
<i>He doesn't know the unseen forces</i>
<i>ranging against him.</i>

2701
02:42:43,335 --> 02:42:47,011
At police headquarters, he was booked
for murdering Tippet.

2702
02:42:47,175 --> 02:42:49,006
<i>No legal counsel was provided.</i>

2703
02:42:49,095 --> 02:42:51,166
<i>No record made of the questioning.</i>

2704
02:42:51,335 --> 02:42:53,899
<i>When the sun rises the next morning...</i>

2705
02:42:54,056 --> 02:42:56,447
<i>...he is booked for murdering the President.</i>

2706
02:42:56,539 --> 02:43:00,327
<i>The whole country, fueled by the media,</i>
<i>assumes he is guilty.</i>

2707
02:43:01,015 --> 02:43:03,658
<i>Under the guise of a patriotic club owner...</i>

2708
02:43:03,819 --> 02:43:07,092
<i>...out to spare Jackie Kennedy</i>
<i>from testifying at a trial...</i>

2709
02:43:07,175 --> 02:43:09,568
<i>...Jack Ruby is let into a garage...</i>

2710
02:43:09,739 --> 02:43:12,852
<i>...by one of his inside men</i>
<i>on the police force.</i>

2711
02:43:13,175 --> 02:43:16,292
<i>Oswald is brought out</i>
<i>like a sacrificial lamb...</i>

2712
02:43:17,175 --> 02:43:20,212
<i>...and nicely disposed of as an enemy</i>
<i>of the people.</i>

2713
02:43:37,899 --> 02:43:40,046
<i>Who grieves for Lee Harvey Oswald...</i>

2714
02:43:40,618 --> 02:43:43,577
...buried in a cheap grave
under the name Oswald?

2715
02:43:44,458 --> 02:43:45,414
<i>Nobody.</i>

2716
02:43:53,175 --> 02:43:57,168
False statements and press leaks
about Oswald circulate the globe.

2717
02:43:58,376 --> 02:44:01,890
<i>The official legend is created</i>
<i>and the media takes it from there.</i>

2718
02:44:03,095 --> 02:44:07,009
The glitter of official lies
and the epic splendor of JFK's funeral...

2719
02:44:07,175 --> 02:44:10,375
...confuse the eye
and confound the understanding.

2720
02:44:11,416 --> 02:44:12,738
Hitler said:

2721
02:44:13,335 --> 02:44:16,775
"The bigger the lie,
the more people will believe it."

2722
02:44:17,819 --> 02:44:21,333
Lee Harvey Oswald, a crazed,
lonely man who wanted attention...

2723
02:44:21,498 --> 02:44:26,047
...and got it by killing a President
was only the first in a long line of patsies.

2724
02:44:26,296 --> 02:44:29,014
In later years, Bobby Kennedy,
Martin Luther King...

2725
02:44:29,095 --> 02:44:31,738
...men whose commitment
to change and peace...

2726
02:44:31,899 --> 02:44:35,414
...made them dangerous to men
committed to war, would follow...

2727
02:44:35,819 --> 02:44:38,616
...also killed by such lonely crazed men.

2728
02:44:39,578 --> 02:44:43,888
Men who remove all guilt by making
murder a meaningless act of a loner.

2729
02:44:44,935 --> 02:44:49,009
We've all become Hamlets in our country,
children of a slain father-leader...

2730
02:44:49,095 --> 02:44:51,567
...whose killers still possess the throne.

2731
02:44:51,899 --> 02:44:55,573
The ghost of John F. Kennedy confronts us
with the secret murder...

2732
02:44:55,739 --> 02:44:57,806
...at the heart of the American Dream.

2733
02:44:57,899 --> 02:45:02,370
He forces on us the appalling questions:
Of what is our Constitution made?

2734
02:45:02,778 --> 02:45:04,766
What are our lives worth?

2735
02:45:05,255 --> 02:45:07,249
What is the future of a democracy...

2736
02:45:07,335 --> 02:45:11,490
...where a President can be assassinated
under suspicious circumstances...

2737
02:45:11,659 --> 02:45:14,807
...while the machinery of legal action
scarcely trembles?

2738
02:45:15,498 --> 02:45:18,932
How many more political murders
disguised as heart attacks...

2739
02:45:19,175 --> 02:45:21,644
...suicides, cancers, drug overdoses?

2740
02:45:21,899 --> 02:45:24,458
How many plane and car crashes
will occur...

2741
02:45:24,618 --> 02:45:27,175
...before they are exposed
for what they are?

2742
02:45:28,539 --> 02:45:31,656
"Treason doth never prosper,"
wrote an English poet.

2743
02:45:32,136 --> 02:45:33,617
"What's the reason?"

2744
02:45:34,216 --> 02:45:36,854
"For if it prosper,
none dare call it treason."

2745
02:45:37,659 --> 02:45:40,616
The American public has yet
to see the Zapruder film.

2746
02:45:41,015 --> 02:45:42,050
Why?

2747
02:45:42,618 --> 02:45:46,692
The American public has yet to see
the real X-rays and autopsy photographs.

2748
02:45:46,858 --> 02:45:47,734
Why?

2749
02:45:48,618 --> 02:45:51,736
Hundreds of documents could help prove
this conspiracy.

2750
02:45:51,899 --> 02:45:54,968
Why are they being withheld
or burned by the government?

2751
02:45:55,739 --> 02:46:00,290
When my office or you, the people, asked
those questions, demanded evidence...

2752
02:46:00,458 --> 02:46:04,209
...the answer from on high
has always been: national security.

2753
02:46:05,095 --> 02:46:09,088
What kind of national security do we have
when we're robbed of our leaders?

2754
02:46:09,498 --> 02:46:11,885
What national security
permits the removal...

2755
02:46:11,976 --> 02:46:14,539
...of fundamental power from the people...

2756
02:46:14,698 --> 02:46:18,692
...and validates the ascendancy
of an invisible government in the US?

2757
02:46:19,578 --> 02:46:21,649
That kind of national security is...

2758
02:46:21,739 --> 02:46:25,333
...when it smells like it, feels like it,
and looks like it...

2759
02:46:25,498 --> 02:46:27,489
...you call it what it is:

2760
02:46:27,659 --> 02:46:28,884
Fascism!

2761
02:46:31,015 --> 02:46:34,770
I submit to you that what took place
on November 22, 1963...

2762
02:46:35,976 --> 02:46:37,775
...was a <i>coup d'tat</i>.

2763
02:46:38,216 --> 02:46:40,448
Its most direct and tragic result...

2764
02:46:40,618 --> 02:46:44,453
...was the reversal of Kennedy's decision
to withdraw from Vietnam.

2765
02:46:45,659 --> 02:46:48,295
The war is the biggest business
in America...

2766
02:46:48,458 --> 02:46:50,528
...worth $80 billion a year.

2767
02:46:51,416 --> 02:46:54,213
President Kennedy was murdered
by a conspiracy...

2768
02:46:54,376 --> 02:46:57,174
...planned at the highest levels
of our government...

2769
02:46:57,255 --> 02:47:00,614
...carried out by fanatical
and disciplined cold warriors...

2770
02:47:00,778 --> 02:47:04,131
...in the Pentagon and CIA's
covert-operation apparatus.

2771
02:47:04,296 --> 02:47:06,968
Among them, Clay Shaw, here before you.

2772
02:47:07,416 --> 02:47:10,615
It was a public execution,
and it was covered up by...

2773
02:47:10,778 --> 02:47:13,335
...like-minded people in the Dallas Police...

2774
02:47:13,578 --> 02:47:16,536
...the Secret Service, the FBl,
and the White House...

2775
02:47:16,698 --> 02:47:20,487
...up to and including J. Edgar Hoover,
and Lyndon Johnson...

2776
02:47:21,255 --> 02:47:23,568
...who were accomplices after the fact.

2777
02:47:23,899 --> 02:47:27,854
The assassination reduced the President
to a transient official.

2778
02:47:28,858 --> 02:47:33,454
His job is to speak as often as possible
of the nation's desire for peace...

2779
02:47:34,056 --> 02:47:36,777
...while he acts as a business agent
in the Congress...

2780
02:47:36,858 --> 02:47:39,327
...for the military and their contractors.

2781
02:47:40,858 --> 02:47:42,891
Some people say I'm crazy.

2782
02:47:44,296 --> 02:47:47,129
Southern caricature seeking higher office.

2783
02:47:49,255 --> 02:47:52,134
There's a simple way to determine
if I am paranoid.

2784
02:47:52,618 --> 02:47:55,416
Ask the two men who profited most
from the assassination...

2785
02:47:55,498 --> 02:47:59,250
...former President Johnson
and your new President, Nixon...

2786
02:47:59,416 --> 02:48:03,932
...to release the 51 CIA documents
pertaining to Lee Oswald and Jack Ruby.

2787
02:48:04,618 --> 02:48:06,291
Or the secret CIA memo...

2788
02:48:06,458 --> 02:48:10,691
...on Oswald's activities in Russia that
was destroyed while being photocopied.

2789
02:48:10,778 --> 02:48:12,497
These documents are yours.

2790
02:48:13,175 --> 02:48:15,739
The people's property. You pay for it.

2791
02:48:16,296 --> 02:48:18,528
But as the government sees you
as children...

2792
02:48:18,618 --> 02:48:21,816
...who might be too disturbed
to face this reality...

2793
02:48:22,618 --> 02:48:25,254
...or because you might lynch
those involved...

2794
02:48:25,578 --> 02:48:28,615
...you cannot see these documents
for another 75 years.

2795
02:48:29,659 --> 02:48:31,250
I'm in my 40's...

2796
02:48:32,458 --> 02:48:35,416
...so I'll have "shuffled off
this mortal coil" by then.

2797
02:48:35,498 --> 02:48:39,808
But I'm telling my eight-year-old son
to keep himself physically fit...

2798
02:48:40,458 --> 02:48:43,811
...so that one glorious September morning,
in 2038...

2799
02:48:44,539 --> 02:48:49,051
...he can go to the National Archives
and learn what the CIA and FBI knew.

2800
02:48:50,618 --> 02:48:52,685
They may push it back then.

2801
02:48:52,935 --> 02:48:57,489
It may become a generational affair.
Questions passed from parent to child.

2802
02:48:57,739 --> 02:49:01,492
But someday, somewhere,
someone may find out the damn truth.

2803
02:49:02,458 --> 02:49:03,527
We better.

2804
02:49:04,858 --> 02:49:08,534
Or we might just as well build ourselves
another government...

2805
02:49:08,698 --> 02:49:12,927
...like the Declaration of Independence
says to, when the old one don't work.

2806
02:49:13,095 --> 02:49:14,926
Just a bit farther out West.

2807
02:49:16,296 --> 02:49:18,368
An American naturalist wrote:

2808
02:49:18,539 --> 02:49:21,576
"A patriot must always be ready
to defend his country...

2809
02:49:21,899 --> 02:49:23,727
"...against its government."

2810
02:49:25,255 --> 02:49:27,374
I'd hate to be in your shoes today.

2811
02:49:28,056 --> 02:49:32,530
You have a lot to think about. You've seen
evidence the public hasn't seen.

2812
02:49:33,739 --> 02:49:36,206
Going back to when we were children...

2813
02:49:36,778 --> 02:49:39,247
...I think most of us in this courtroom...

2814
02:49:39,416 --> 02:49:41,976
...thought justice came automatically.

2815
02:49:42,458 --> 02:49:44,450
That virtue was its own reward.

2816
02:49:44,618 --> 02:49:46,530
That good triumphs over evil.

2817
02:49:47,578 --> 02:49:50,375
But as we get older
we know this isn't true.

2818
02:49:51,175 --> 02:49:55,410
Individual human beings have to create
justice, and this is not easy...

2819
02:49:56,458 --> 02:49:59,496
...because the truth often poses a threat
to power...

2820
02:49:59,819 --> 02:50:03,252
...and one often has to fight power
at great risk to themselves.

2821
02:50:03,498 --> 02:50:05,569
People like S.M. Holland...

2822
02:50:05,976 --> 02:50:07,411
...Lee Bowers...

2823
02:50:07,739 --> 02:50:09,490
...Jean Hill, Willie O'Keefe...

2824
02:50:09,578 --> 02:50:12,727
...have all taken that risk
and they've all come forward.

2825
02:50:13,095 --> 02:50:15,974
I have here some $8,000 in these letters...

2826
02:50:16,778 --> 02:50:19,005
...sent from all over the country.

2827
02:50:19,175 --> 02:50:21,739
Quarters, dimes, dollars from housewives...

2828
02:50:22,296 --> 02:50:25,291
...plumbers, car salesmen,
teachers, invalids.

2829
02:50:26,216 --> 02:50:29,495
These are people who cannot afford
to send money but do.

2830
02:50:30,296 --> 02:50:32,048
People who drive cabs...

2831
02:50:32,778 --> 02:50:34,371
...who nurse in hospitals...

2832
02:50:34,458 --> 02:50:36,969
...who see their kids go to Vietnam.

2833
02:50:37,976 --> 02:50:39,011
Why?

2834
02:50:40,376 --> 02:50:42,048
Because they care.

2835
02:50:42,698 --> 02:50:44,845
Because they want to know the truth.

2836
02:50:45,416 --> 02:50:47,489
Because they want their country back.

2837
02:50:47,578 --> 02:50:49,806
Because it still belongs to us...

2838
02:50:49,976 --> 02:50:53,888
...as long as the people have the guts
to fight for what they believe in.

2839
02:50:55,976 --> 02:51:00,128
The truth is the most important value
we have because if it doesn't endure...

2840
02:51:00,976 --> 02:51:02,775
...if the government murders truth...

2841
02:51:02,858 --> 02:51:05,532
...if we cannot respect these people...

2842
02:51:06,056 --> 02:51:10,530
...then this is not the country I was born in,
or the country I want to die in.

2843
02:51:11,819 --> 02:51:13,090
Tennyson wrote:

2844
02:51:13,255 --> 02:51:15,489
"Authority forgets a dying king."

2845
02:51:16,976 --> 02:51:19,697
This was never more true
than for John F. Kennedy...

2846
02:51:19,778 --> 02:51:23,051
...whose murder was probably one
of the most terrible moments...

2847
02:51:23,136 --> 02:51:25,208
...in the history of our country.

2848
02:51:27,778 --> 02:51:31,613
We, the people, the jury system sitting
in judgment on Clay Shaw...

2849
02:51:33,296 --> 02:51:34,888
...represent the hope...

2850
02:51:35,056 --> 02:51:37,618
...of humanity against government power.

2851
02:51:38,659 --> 02:51:40,569
In discharging your duty...

2852
02:51:41,216 --> 02:51:44,575
...to bring a first conviction
in this house of cards...

2853
02:51:44,739 --> 02:51:46,490
...against Clay Shaw...

2854
02:51:46,819 --> 02:51:51,253
"...ask not what your country can do for
you but what you can do for your country."

2855
02:51:51,858 --> 02:51:53,416
Do not forget...

2856
02:51:53,899 --> 02:51:55,616
...your dying king.

2857
02:51:57,056 --> 02:51:58,727
Show this world...

2858
02:51:59,136 --> 02:52:03,765
...this is still a government "of the people,
for the people and by the people."

2859
02:52:06,175 --> 02:52:08,086
Nothing as long as you live...

2860
02:52:08,175 --> 02:52:10,086
...will ever be more important.

2861
02:52:13,216 --> 02:52:14,537
It's up to you.

2862
02:52:36,739 --> 02:52:39,011
Has the jury reached a verdict?

2863
02:52:39,296 --> 02:52:40,572
We have, Your Honor.

2864
02:52:40,659 --> 02:52:42,965
Please hand the verdict to the clerk.

2865
02:52:52,095 --> 02:52:54,373
Will the defendant please rise?

2866
02:52:58,618 --> 02:53:00,765
The clerk will now read the verdict.

2867
02:53:01,296 --> 02:53:04,093
"New Orleans, Louisiana. March 1, 1969."

2868
02:53:05,976 --> 02:53:09,604
"We, the jury, find the defendant,
Clay Shaw, not guilty."

2869
02:53:31,376 --> 02:53:33,048
We believe there was a conspiracy.

2870
02:53:33,136 --> 02:53:36,013
Whether Shaw was a part of it
is another kettle of fish.

2871
02:53:36,095 --> 02:53:37,498
There's Jim!

2872
02:53:39,935 --> 02:53:44,213
Do you agree that this is a full vindication
of the Warren Commission?

2873
02:53:46,175 --> 02:53:49,329
It only proves you cannot run
an investigation...

2874
02:53:49,618 --> 02:53:53,578
...questioning the intelligence operations
of the US government.

2875
02:53:54,015 --> 02:53:56,578
People claim you're unfit to hold office...

2876
02:53:56,819 --> 02:53:59,376
...that you've ruined
Clay Shaw's reputation.

2877
02:53:59,539 --> 02:54:01,128
Are you going to resign?

2878
02:54:01,458 --> 02:54:04,925
Hell no! I'm going to run again,
and I'm going to win!

2879
02:54:05,376 --> 02:54:07,208
Who will you persecute next?

2880
02:54:07,376 --> 02:54:10,254
If it takes me 30 years to nail every one
of the assassins...

2881
02:54:10,335 --> 02:54:12,930
...then I will continue for 30 years!

2882
02:54:13,376 --> 02:54:16,209
I owe that to Jack Kennedy
and the country.

2883
02:54:16,578 --> 02:54:18,806
There's Clay! There's Clay Shaw!

2884
02:54:19,136 --> 02:54:22,733
-How does it feel to be acquitted?
-lt's been exhausting.

2885
02:54:22,819 --> 02:54:23,774
What'll you do now?

2886
02:54:23,858 --> 02:54:26,085
I'm going home and cook some touffe.

2887
02:54:27,175 --> 02:54:28,407
Were you confident about the outcome?

2888
02:54:30,056 --> 02:54:33,128
-Do you think Garrison will be back?
-I'm sure he will.
