00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,445
You just worry about
getting that money together.

171
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,405
I'll take care of Janet.

172
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,862
Right on. Thanks, man.

173
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,709
[Ned] Hey, just remember,

174
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:03,668
Omega-3s for the blepharitis,
it helps with everything.

175
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,924
- [man] Thanks for the tip, Ned.
- [Ned] Thanks, Hauser.

176
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:09,552
You know what the worst part is? She's
insisting on keeping Willie Nelson.

177
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:11,008
- No!
- [all gasp] No, way!

178
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,094
I thought she was a Buddhist
or something.

179
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,429
I'm so sorry, I know
how much you love him.

180
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,310
- That sucks, Ned.
- Yeah, it's really tough,

181
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,596
but you know what I'm gonna do
is get some money together

182
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:23,517
and I'm gonna rent the goat barn
on the back 40, so...

183
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,436
The goat barn. PH.
Better hurry up on that one.

184
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:29,402
- Yeah.
- How much you need for the goat barn?

185
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:32,568
I'm sure we could rustle up
some cash for you?

186
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:38,540
Um, I thought we agreed as a family
not to loan each other money.

187
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:39,915
Yeah, no, right, obviously.

188
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,623
Because then we would've blown through
Dylan's inheritance by now.

189
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:48,667
I just thought that it would be,
you know, better if Ned were to...

190
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:50,923
...earn it himself.

191
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,133
For Ned, yeah, for you.

192
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:56,140
Absolutely, no, for sure.
I'm not a charity case.

193
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:59,803
I wanna work, so if you hear of
anything, any odd jobs or anything,

194
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,313
please, let me know, because...

195
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,850
Maybe there's something
on your movie you could...

196
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,439
There wouldn't... No, no.

197
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:10,651
No. No, we're pretty well-staffed
at the moment.

198
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,315
Yeah, sorry, it's...

199
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:15,031
[Natalie] You know what you really need
is to get laid.

200
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:18,618
I have, like, five hot roommates,
a couple of them would totally fuck you.

201
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,498
- Definitely.
- Dude,

202
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:23,126
can we discuss living with
that many people at this age?

203
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,661
I mean, it's kind of gnarly.

204
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,671
Well, actually, we looked at
a two-bedroom in Brooklyn Heights.

205
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,673
- Right, Nat?
- For you two?

206
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,210
- That's awesome.
- Good! That's so exciting!

207
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,254
- Can I come check it out?
- Yeah, of course.

208
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,548
Contain your enthusiasm, Nat.

209
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,179
No, it's just...

210
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,310
I get worried, because...

211
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:45,064
...people who move in together
always end up either breaking up

212
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:46,816
or getting married.

213
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:50,361
- OK.
- No, no, no, no.

214
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,482
Why would you say that in front
of everybody? I don't understand.

215
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:55,821
[both whispering]

216
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,531
- Come here.
- OK.

217
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,788
[woman] Take a breath, Mom.

218
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,703
- Relax, take a breath.
- We have to go. Seth has a show.

219
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,668
- Yeah. Who's Seth?
- I have a deadline. I'm gonna go too.

220
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:12,505
What about cake? Aren't we
gonna play a game or something?

221
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,510
[Dylan] We should probably
get going as well.

222
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:18,048
Hey, sunshine, we gotta get home
and practice your shehnai.

223
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:19,549
You're right.

224
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,889
I'll out you a slice, River,
you can take it with you.

225
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,554
Oh, no, he had a cupcake yesterday.

226
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,398
We're off sugar today.
Thanks, though, Ned.

227
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:30,982
[sister] Such a lucky kid,
gets a cupcake once a week.

228
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,612
So, I'll see you guys next week, OK?

229
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,864
- Bye, Mom!
- You guys really have to go so soon?

230
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,570
It's still light out.

231
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,906
I know, but I'm so psyched
to have you next week.

232
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,196
- Yeah, to next week! Bye, guys.
- [Natalie] Cindy!

233
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:44,081
- [Cindy] Coming, coming!
- [horn honks]

234
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,169
Our door is always open, Ned.

235
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,338
We'll see you next week, OK? Bye!

236
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,091
Bye;

237
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,969
You know, Nedly, I love you.

238
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,263
I love you too, Mom.

239
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:03,723
Even though you've never had a real job
and that problem with the jail business,

240
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:06,638
and you've never given me
any grandchildren.

241
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,723
Yeah, well...

242
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,275
Any plans for tomorrow?

243
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,861
I don't even know where to begin.

244
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,274
Then we'll drive over to Calico Corner,
I gotta get a new button.

245
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:21,612
- You need any?
- I'm OK.

246
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:24,122
Let's get an early start,
we'll beat the crowds.

247
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:26,999
OK.

248
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,295
[sighs] I'm glad you're staying here.

249
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,336
Nighty-night.

250
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:37,423
- Good night, Mom.
- Sleep tight.

251
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,838
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

252
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:49,935
[slowly] I'm... Officer...
Omar... Coleman.

253
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:56,272
I'm... your... parole... officer.

254
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:00,818
I'm Ned Rochlin.
Why are you talking so slow?

255
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,906
I just figured, looking at your sheet,

256
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,822
that since you sold grass
to a uniformed police officer

257
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,490
that you must be retarded.

258
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:11,537
- [laughs] Yeah, I get that a lot.
- Right.

259
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,796
You need a signed rental agreement
in your name

260
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:16,549
or written confirmation that
you're staying with a family member.

261
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:20,507
OK. Well, currently I'm staying with
my mom in Long Island. Although, I...

262
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,593
You're required to appear
before me every three weeks,

263
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,508
at which time you'll provide me
with a urine sample. You understand?

264
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:27,348
Oh, yes, sir, Your Honor.

265
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,729
State of New York requires you
to reflect upon the choices

266
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,434
that led to your incarceration.

267
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,017
- Cool.
- Cool.

268
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:37,778
Um, what steps are you taking to avoid
such choices in the future?

269
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:41,699
Uh... I'll tell you,
that's really tough...

270
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:44,407
...tough for me, sir. I don't really...

271
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,162
Hmm. Hm.

272
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:54,246
Wow, that's a good question. I don't...
It's tough to answer right now.

273
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,210
I haven't thought about it
that much, but,

274
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,625
I don't know. I mean, I'm not
gonna be working at the farm anymore.

275
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,385
- OK.
- Although, you might not want to

276
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,888
write that one down, 'cause it's
not so much a step, per se.

277
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,299
Because it's not my choice.
I'd love to be working there,

278
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,686
but my girlfriend, Janet,
doesn't want it to happen really.

279
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,560
How about we put down you're staying
away from past criminal associates?

280
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

281
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:16,730
- If you think that's best.
- Yeah.

282
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:21,443
You know what? I'll think about it
and I'll try and come back next time

283
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:26,077
with some more steps and options, that
kind of thing, for our next meeting.

284
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,078
- You do that, buddy.
- This is cool, man.

285
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,989
- Yeah.
- This is like...

286
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:33,706
This is like free therapy.
New York State cares.

287
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:40,754
Is that it? That's it?

288
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,510
- That's it.
- My 50 minutes are up?

289
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,716
- Yeah.
- All right, man. OK.

290
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:45,880
- OK.
- Thanks a lot.

291
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:48,887
Hey, is it lame if I bail on Nat's show?

292
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,348
Yeah. Then no one will be there.

293
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,684
What the hell is that noise?

294
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:58,022
- Oh, that's River's shehnai.
- [croaking instrument sound]

295
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,778
You have no idea how competitive
admissions have gotten.

296
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,606
God, Ned just showed up.

297
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,113
- I'll call you back.
- All right, bye.

298
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,373
Hi.

299
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:16,287
- You said your door was always open.
- I did, yeah.

300
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,503
I hope this is OK, Ned.

301
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,589
Are you kidding? This is great.

302
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,722
My God, I get to rock
the full-on slumber party

303
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,928
with my man River every night.

304
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,352
I mean, Mom's great and all, but...

305
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:36,606
Oh. No, Ned, it's all right. I get it.

306
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:41,732
So, the deal is, if it's OK with you,

307
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:46,320
you'll get $250 a week,
you'll help us out with River,

308
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:50,612
and you get to work with Dylan
on the documentary.

309
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,997
Yeah, I hope you don't have to fire
anyone to make room for me, Dyl.

310
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:56,284
Oh, yeah, but it's family first, right?

311
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,412
You guys.

312
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,130
[grunts]

313
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,512
[indistinct chatter]

314
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,435
[Ned] Come on, bud, let's go.

315
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,263
[percussive music plays]

316
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:30,326
- [shouting]
- [River laughs]

317
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:35,831
[both laughing]

318
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,869
So, you're telling me
you've never seen The Pink Panther?

319
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,833
Mom and Dad don't like violent movies.

320
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:43,089
Yeah, but it's not violent,
it's hilarious.

321
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,249
- Nobody's actually getting hurt.
- Mm-hmm.

322
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,169
Get on your feet. Come on, come here.

323
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:51,180
On your feet, River Rochlin Byng.

324
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:52,386
[karate greeting]

325
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,801
Welcome to my dojo.

326
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:56,594
Give me a chop.

327
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:02,149
- What was that?
- Karate chop.

328
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:06,233
That was a...? That wasn't a chop.
You know what that was? That was this...

329
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,570
- Chop me. Do it.
- [laughs]

330
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:13,202
- How about this?
- Oh! Ah!

331
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:15,034
[laughing]

332
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:18,871
Christ! it's after 10:00, for Christ's
sakes, River has school in the morning.

333
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:22,754
Oh, God, sorry, yeah.
I must've lost track of time again.

334
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:25,665
Ned, what's the laptop
doing in his bedroom?

335
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,300
We were just watching Pink Panther.

336
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:33,052
We loaned you the computer for your
resume, not to look at pink panthers.

337
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,722
No, The Pink...
it's just Pink Panther.

338
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:40,434
This country's obsessed with screens.

339
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,525
He's seven years-old,
for Christ's sakes.

340
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,277
- [crashing]
- Ahh.

341
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,315
Whoops.

342
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,704
- Good night, Riv.
- Good night.

343
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,494
[Natalie] I mean, he's not
like a criminal or anything,

344
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:02,160
he's just a fuck-up who needs help.

345
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:05,125
Well, if he's got any of your genes,
I'd be happy to throw him a few bucks

346
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,460
- to do a little modeling.
- That would be awesome.

347
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,046
Then he'd have cash
and somewhere to go.

348
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:14,589
Sure. Hey, have you heard
of Sustainable Upgrade?

349
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:19,389
Sustainable Upgrade,
it's a life-coaching program.

350
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:23,056
It saved me. I was like
your brother is now, floating.

351
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,189
[laughs]

352
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:27,101
Waiting for someone
to give me a sense of purpose.

353
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,771
Cool, I'll tell him.

354
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,280
Want to come to a meeting too?

355
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,158
- Mmm, I don't know.
- No.

356
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:37,820
You are capable
of extraordinary things, Natalie.

357
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:41,537
You just have to let yourself go there.

358
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:45,002
[laughs] it's not like a cult, is it?

359
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,834
Cult? [laughs] No.

360
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:50,004
No. I'll tell you what,
I'll take you both.

361
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,840
Just check it out, no pressure.

362
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,271
[classical piano music plays]

363
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:16,192
What we're doing is we're
filming this documentary movie

364
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,701
about Tatiana.

365
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,034
And all of the artistic repression
that she faced in Belorussia.

366
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:25,373
What I'd love to get from you guys would
be signatures on these releases.

367
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,162
Thank you.

368
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:31,832
[clears throat]

369
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,673
- [Ned] Excuse me, ladies...
- Jesus.

370
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:38,548
Ah! [laughs]

371
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:39,761
- Man...
- [woman] It hurts.

372
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:42,177
- [Ned] It does. It does, God!
- [woman] I know.

373
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:43,845
I think I need leg warmers.

374
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:47,060
- My Croc is stuck.
- Hey.

375
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,317
- Hey.
- Is this joker bothering you?

376
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:52,194
No, not at all. He's very cute.

377
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:53,900
He's pretty funny.

378
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:56,566
You wanna go grab the bags,
take them down to the car?

379
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,826
Sure. I told her
you're my brother-in-law.

380
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,611
She didn't know you were married.

381
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:02,325
- Oh.
- No.

382
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:06,459
You gotta look at this thing she can do
with her leg. This is amazing. Show him.

383
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,958
- Look at...!
- I've just been shooting this stuff.

384
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,373
But, hey, I never tire of it.

385
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,965
[laughs] Look at this. I can get it...
This is how high I can go.

386
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,093
[both laugh]

387
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:19,927
I know. You just did it
five seconds ago.

388
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:21,762
Oh, yeah. I didn't know if you saw it.

389
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,760
Well, I've been here, like, 25 seconds.

390
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:27,726
Oh. [laughs]

391
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:30,566
- Go get the bags, wise-guy.
- [laughs]

392
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:33,022
Well, sure thing. I'll go get 'em, boss.

393
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:36,447
Seriously, go get the bags.

394
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,778
Oh, yeah, yeah. OK.

395
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:43,204
- [laughing, banging]
- [Ned] Ah!

396
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,658
Oh, right in my gluteus maximus!

397
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:49,293
- Get your stinky feet off me.
- Stop tickling me!

398
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,579
[Ned] I'm not tickling you,
what are you talking about?

399
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:56,042
So has Nat always been a lesbian?

400
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,836
Oh, no, no, she's open
to pretty much anyone.

401
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:03,133
Boys, girls, old, young, thin, fat.

402
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,301
That's a beautiful thing, actually.

403
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:09,518
- That is beautiful.
- She even slept with our cousin once.

404
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:21,572
- [man] Dude! What the fuck!
- Sorry, sorry... to everybody.

405
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:25,992
Man, can you hold this? Thanks.

406
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:44,473
Thanks, man. I feel like an idiot.
[laughs]

407
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:50,262
- You done yet?
- No, I still can't go.

408
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,352
[Omar] Gotta get that sample.

409
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:55,313
Hey, your two job's gonna look
good on my monthly stats.

410
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:57,524
I'm telling you, Omar,
good things happen.

411
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:01,156
- Good things happen.
- Yeah, I'll keep that in mind, Ned.

412
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:05,528
Oh, now if you're gonna move into that
barn residence you referred to,

413
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:08,413
you gotta register the address here
within three days of moving in.

414
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:09,994
Oh, yeah.

415
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:13,707
One more minute
or I'm getting the cranberry juice.

416
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,712
Nope, almost there.

417
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:17,965
There we go.

418
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:20,968
- Oh!
- [laughs]

419
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,884
Sorry, man, I shouldn't have gone
before I came here. I'm so stupid.

420
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:26,344
I don't know what I was thinking.

421
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,098
- That was funny, Ned.
- [laughs]

422
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,354
- Yeah.
- You... [laughs]

423
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:35,270
The car is now 35 minutes late.

424
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:40,734
If the driver knew there was traffic,
why didn't the driver call me then?

425
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:44,571
Yes, I know, but you see, I'm
interviewing a very important person,

426
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,077
in less than 20 minutes and I...

427
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:49,159
Don't...! [groans]

428
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,994
Jer, see if he's out there for me.

429
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,453
Yep-

430
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:56,754
This is a disaster, Jer.
I cannot be late for this.

431
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,965
- [sighs] Jesus Christ.
- No.

432
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:04,049
[groans] I can't believe
I'm calling this person.

433
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,713
Who is she exactly?

434
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:09,474
Lady Arabella Galloway,
heir presumptive to the House of Stuart,

435
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,635
one of the wealthiest women
in the world.

436
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:12,928
Jesus.

437
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:16,224
Yeah, her creepy ex-boyfriend stole
ten million dollars from the family,

438
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,518
and then sold their sex tape
to pay his legal bills.

439
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:21,403
He's a gem. OK, Ned,
you gotta do me a favor.

440
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:23,439
First of all, we need to step on it,
we're really late.

441
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:26,779
Next of all, maybe don't say
anything stupid.

442
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:30,196
Actually, don't say anything at all.
Just keep your mouth shut.

443
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:33,161
This is the first time I'm writing about
an actual person, not just moisturizer.

444
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,791
So I really can't fuck it up.

445
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,668
- Hi, Lady Arabella.
- Hi.

446
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:46,678
- Miranda Rochlin, Vanity Fair
- Nice to meet you.

447
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:50,467
So nice to meet you.
Here, just jump right in.

448
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:53,803
So sorry that we were late.
The town car was stuck in traffic,

449
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,142
- this is my sister's car, I had to...
- it's OK.

450
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:58,182
- OK. I feel horrible.
- No, it's lovely to meet you.

451
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:01,101
- Thank you, you too.
- Hi, I'm Arabella.

452
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,863
You can introduce yourself, Ned.

453
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:08,158
Oh, yes. I'm Ned.

454
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:10,661
- I'm her brother.
- Yeah, he's just my brother.

455
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,492
That's... that's all.

456
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,076
So, are you two a team?

457
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,334
Us? No. Hm-mm. No.

458
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:19,416
I'm just kind of doing this
as an odd job.

459
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,751
- Yeah.
- Been out of the workforce for a while.

460
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,884
- Really? Where were you?
- Oh, I was sort of in jail.

461
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:28,091
Oh. He's not a...
He's not a criminal or anything,

462
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,257
he's just an organic farmer
that made a stupid mistake. So...

463
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,017
- Well, biodynamic, actually.
- OK, Ned.

464
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:37,180
What is biodynamic, exactly?
I've never understood the difference.

465
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:39,474
Planting kind of depends
on the lunar calendar.

466
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,688
- Species of lettuce, for example...
- Thank you, Ned.

467
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,103
Arabella?
I was thinking we should get started.

468
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:49,696
OK, my lawyer said you agreed not to ask
about him and the whole YouTube thing.

469
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:53,700
Absolutely, yeah.
Everybody's dated a jerk,

470
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:56,866
so at the end of the day,
that is just an old, boring story.

471
00:26:58,075 --> 00:26:59,452
- OK. Good.
- Yeah.

472
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:05,296
No, what I'm truly fascinated by is the
work you are doing with Destiny's House.

473
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:08,010
[Arabella] it's the same story
for all of them.

474
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:11,889
Seduced at 13 or 14 by grown men
who make them feel loved

475
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:14,846
and then brainwash them
into prostitution.

476
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,515
- So sad.
- Yeah.

477
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:20,602
Well, I guess we're all capable
of trusting the wrong person.

478
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,563
Are you speaking
from personal experience?

479
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:26,569
Hey, Ebony, thank you for the playlist.

480
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,401
- Love Major Lazer.
- [girl] No problem.

481
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:31,067
[Arabella] And then there's
Shanequa, she got really into boxing.

482
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:33,736
Not just like boxing matches,
more like fight training.

483
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,904
- Shanequa?
- [Ned] Yeah, you know my nephew River

484
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:40,076
wants to do something like that, but Liz
won't have anything to do with it.

485
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:42,665
- Is that the lesbian sister?
- [Ned] That's Nat.

486
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:45,877
She's really more of a bisexual.
Or at least formerly-bisexual.

487
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:50,089
I don't know how you describe it.
How would you describe Nat?

488
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,172
- Arabella, I was wondering...
- [Arabella] If you guys are interested,

489
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,215
you should come to the benefit
we're having on Sunday.

490
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,601
- Benefit? Oh, yeah!
- The girls will be there.

491
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:00,057
That could be great.

492
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,064
- I do have this deadline, though.
- [laughs] Man, I love it.

493
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:06,397
One minute I'm scrubbing toilets at
Marble Valley Regional with Dom,

494
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,779
out to: I'm on the charity circuit.

495
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:12,362
- [Ned sipping] Mm.
- [Arabella] it's good, right?

496
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,572
- [woman] Are you convinced?
- Nice, nice.

497
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:17,033
Way to tell it true, yeah.

498
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,164
Anybody else? How about you? Beth?

499
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:21,208
Share your story.

500
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:22,826
Sure.

501
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:27,748
Hi, everyone, my name is Beth Phillips

502
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:30,213
and I'm from Paramus, New Jersey.

503
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,924
- Hey, Beth.
- [Beth laughs]

504
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:36,260
[Beth] Uh, I used to call myself
a romance addict.

505
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:39,017
And then, I went in the win room.

506
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:44,315
And came out knowing I just used sex
to make me feel like I was in control.

507
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:49,862
But now, I'm engaged to marry a man
who actually loves me.

508
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:53,732
He's so awesome.
He just knit me a scarf.

509
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:55,196
[applause]

510
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,953
[woman] isn't that a beautiful
testimony?

511
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,656
Let's go to the win room.

512
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:05,081
[Natalie] So now, um,
I'm in my crib and...

513
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:10,542
...this time my sister's
not strangling me.

514
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:13,548
She's hugging me and...

515
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:17,306
I feel so positive
and, like, really, like, clear.

516
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:20,058
Like I can do anything.

517
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:23,179
- Yes, you can. You can do anything.
- [applause]

518
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:24,972
That's a great win, Natalie.

519
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:27,311
- Yeah.
- [man] It was beautiful.

520
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:28,976
Hydrate.

521
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:37,693
What about you, Ned?
What are you feeling?

522
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:39,904
Uhh...

523
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:44,366
I just... I feel really hot.

524
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,457
Right. Do you want to expand on that?

525
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:51,047
All I want is to take that pitcher
and just dump it

526
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,709
onto my penis and balls.

527
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:59,386
Move on through it. Come away from the
testicles and up to your higher self.

528
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:02,097
- I think I'm gonna throw up.
- Don't throw up in this tent.

529
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:03,977
Can I please have water without win?

530
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:07,015
Without a win? Can I please have water
without a win? Can you give me some?

531
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,808
Don't enable him. Don't...

532
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:12,353
Ned?

533
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,276
- I'm fine, really.
- You're gonna be fine, man.

534
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:18,909
- We just gotta take you in, all right?
- Are you sure I can't come? I want to.

535
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:22,367
No, no, really. I'm fine. I promise.
You kids enjoy yourselves.

536
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,907
And, seriously,
congratulations on your wins.

537
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,288
I love you, Ned, bye.

538
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,463
[sirens wails]

539
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:53,478
[moaning]

540
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:02,118
Cite Ohio v. McNally, Doug.

541
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,120
Oliver Wendell Holmes 101.

542
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:07,158
[laughs]

543
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:11,666
Yeah, I'll be in in about 40 minutes.
We can talk about it then. OK.

544
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:18,586
- You're so smart.
- Thanks, baby.

545
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:26,719
- You really have to go?
- Yeah. I do.

546
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,226
[car horns honking]

547
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,569
OK...

548
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,907
You know, Ned... Uh...

549
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:48,244
...maybe you should wait here. I've got
to do an interview with Tatiana,

550
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:51,206
- which could be a little sensitive.
- Really, how so?

551
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,334
Well, it's too sensitive, you know,
even to discuss.

552
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:57,466
- Wow.
- Why don't you chill out in the car,

553
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:02,004
- while I go and do it.
- Yeah.

554
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,844
- Do you need any help?
- No, just chill out in the car.

555
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,474
All right.

556
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,603
[siren wails]

557
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:24,235
Come on.

558
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,828
How we doing this evening?

559
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:30,366
Good. Good. Everything's great, officer.

560
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:32,000
I'm on parole.

561
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:35,580
- Any trouble here?
- No, no trouble at all.

562
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:39,208
My brother-in-law's doing a documentary
up in the building up there,

563
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,047
and I'm just...

564
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:44,008
This is my job, to watch this.

565
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:45,673
No trouble, we're not breaking the law.

566
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,841
You're in a 24-hour tow zone.

567
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:51,057
You gotta move this vehicle,
tow truck's behind me.

568
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:54,063
Well, all right.
Thank you for your service.

569
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,024
Ahh.

570
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,908
Just gotta get the keys!

571
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:15,043
Dylan! Dylan!

572
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:19,915
- Dylan!
- [gasping]

573
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,755
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

574
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:25,262
I'm sorry,
I just really need the car keys.

575
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,172
I told you never
to interrupt me when I'm working.

576
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:30,263
Yeah, sorry about that, man.
I need the keys, we're gonna get towed.

577
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:33,429
Wait, wait, wait. Why are they towing
the car? What the fuck did you do?!

578
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:37,270
- I didn't do anything.
- That was your one responsibility, Ned.

579
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,776
Your one responsibility!

580
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:47,742
Hey, Tatiana. Sorry!

581
00:33:57,953 --> 00:33:59,705
[bicycle bell ringing]

582
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,385
- Ned, interviewing is an art form.
- [car starts]

583
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:13,018
When you ask someone to be vulnerable
or naked, you have to be naked too,

584
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:15,804
to make them feel comfortable.

585
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:18,019
- That make sense?
- Yeah, I guess.

586
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:19,649
Great.

587
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:24,984
- This piece is about Destiny's House.
- [sighs]

588
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,319
We need more details about her.

589
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,450
- This woman's been through a lot.
- I know.

590
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:32,783
Robbie, we agreed
with the publicist not to go there.

591
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:35,290
The publicist
is not writing this, Miranda.

592
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:36,825
You are.

593
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:40,496
Your job is to break through to her,
get her to show a little leg.

594
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:43,711
- Come on, you're so charming.
- I know.

595
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,876
You begged me
to get you this assignment.

596
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:50,677
You want to get your first story killed?

597
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:53,675
[sighs]

598
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:57,062
It's just getting to be too much.

599
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:01,437
River's interview is in three days time.
I want him to be...

600
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,195
."enigmatic, erudite,
wise, incandescent.

601
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:09,991
I can't just kick him out.
I'll talk to him.

602
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,950
What, you just decided unilaterally?

603
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,114
No, it's just he's family, Dylan.

604
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:19,205
I can't just turn my back
on him for no reason.

605
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:26,591
Well, can't one of you just take him,
please? He's driving Dylan crazy.

606
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:29,503
No, all we have is that storage room
and Dan's friends from the Ukraine

607
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,717
are staying there.
There's, like, six of them.

608
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,180
I can't do it. I've got a crazy
deadline, I really need to focus.

609
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:38,596
OK, well, thank you guys for your help.

610
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,023
I need to find you.

611
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,892
Cato!

612
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:45,561
[grunting]

613
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,738
What? Where did you go?

614
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:16,300
- Hiya!
- [River screaming]

615
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:18,343
[thumping]

616
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,888
So, River, I like your name.

617
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:23,898
It's better than Echo.

618
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:26,651
- Echo?
- That's my sister.

619
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:29,737
River was conceived in India,
near the Ganges.

620
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:33,400
So what kind of things
do you like to do, River?

621
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:39,956
- Fighting.
- Fighting?

622
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:44,495
- [laughs] What kind of fighting?
- Kun Gek Do.

623
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:49,924
River, why don't you tell Judith
about the shehnai?

624
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:51,756
He's very, very good, actually.

625
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,216
- When his hand has healed...
- Kun Gek Do.

626
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:58,054
I've never heard of that one before.
Tell me about that.

627
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:02,312
It's totally cool. Some of the moves
are just like Taekwondo.

628
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,222
You know, kicking... [shouts]

629
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,062
...and chopping. [shouting]

630
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:11,071
What's special about it is that the guys
can also throw and choke you...

631
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:14,073
- [Dylan] Whoa!
- [Liz] That's enough! I'm so sorry.

632
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:17,452
Seriously, I have no idea
what he's talking about.

633
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,159
Oh, God! [laughs]

634
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,824
Riv, where'd you learn about this?

635
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:26,837
- Uncle Ned and I found it on YouTube.
- YouTube? What?

636
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:30,499
- Ned's so funny.
- Tell me about Uncle Ned.

637
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,508
He just got out of jail.

638
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:36,012
In Japan, for protesting about whales...

639
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:38,344
...like the slaughter of whales.

640
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:41,009
I thought you said
he sold drugs to a policeman?

641
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:43,304
- Oh.
- [sighs]

642
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:48,313
None of this would be possible
if it wasn't for this amazing woman,

643
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:52,525
Rachel, who is a personal hero
to all of us girls.

644
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:55,190
[applause]

645
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:04,540
An right!

646
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,246
It's lovely to see you. Thank you.

647
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:09,663
- Arabella, hi! That was amazing.
- Thank you, Miranda.

648
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:12,048
And you look great.
Whose dress are you wearing?

649
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:15,507
- Mine.
- You're so clever.

650
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:18,512
- Thanks for coming.
- Seriously, though, I'd love to know...

651
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:21,550
[sighs]

652
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:24,219
I don't understand.
So this cop, he just came up

653
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,854
- and he had the hat, the badge...
- Yeah.

654
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:29,857
Well, no, he didn't have a hat.
I just thought he was, like, you know...

655
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,893
..."Brother, help a brother out,"
you know?

656
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,562
- I don't even...
- [laughing]

657
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:36,693
- You're laughing at me.
- I'm not laughing at you.

658
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:39,905
- You're totally laughing.
- I'm laughing at the story, not you.

659
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:43,197
[chuckles] Here's the thing, I...

660
00:38:43,363 --> 00:38:45,240
I live my life a certain way.

661
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:49,456
And that is that I like to think that
if you put your trust out there,

662
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,747
I mean, if you really...

663
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:54,757
...give people the benefit of the doubt,
see their best intentions,

664
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:56,759
they're gonna want to live up to it.

665
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:59,387
It doesn't always work out, clearly.

666
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,425
But, more often than not,
I think that if you do,

667
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:06,891
people will rise to the occasion.
I really believe that.

668
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,851
It's very sweet, Ned.

669
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,856
You think I'm an idiot
like everybody else.

670
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,312
No, I don't think you're an idiot.

671
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:16,230
I think that's a really good way
to live your life.

672
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:19,775
I mean, I'm the same.
At least, I was, yeah.

673
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:22,285
Until I met the fucking Chilean.

674
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:24,863
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

675
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:26,915
What happened?

676
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:30,414
[elevator dings]

677
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,790
So, I mean, I didn't stab him,
I just was trying to scare him.

678
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:36,833
You must think I'm a total psychopath.

679
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,968
I think you're fucking awesome.

680
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:42,677
I do. Hey, you wanna
go out with me sometime?

681
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:48,470
Oh. No, not really. But thanks for
asking. That's really sweet.

682
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:53,065
[Liz] You should have seen him, Ned.

683
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,318
He was flying around the room
like a maniac.

684
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:58,025
I mean, Kum Kak Do,
is that what it's called?

685
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,564
- Kun Gek Do.
- What?

686
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,901
- Kun Gek Do.
- What were you thinking?

687
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:06,788
Liz, every time he sees
those boys doing karate in class,

688
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,493
you should see the look on his face.

689
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,454
He so badly wants to be there.

690
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:14,291
Dylan and I aren't interested
in those values, Ned.

691
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,206
Sorry.

692
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:21,716
You know, he's just a little boy.

693
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,881
Little boys fight.

694
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:28,643
Doesn't mean he's going to grow up
to be a frat-boy rapist.

695
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:35,350
I'm sorry.

696
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,603
- Bye.
- Bye.

697
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:57,547
Here, Ned. It's just a little something.

698
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:02,589
Look, I know you tried.

699
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:04,754
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

700
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:07,299
No, no, no, I am.

701
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,432
Wait, what?

702
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:11,720
How much more do you need to move back
to that sheep farm, or whatever?

703
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,103
Three hundred.

704
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,860
- Oh, yeah, Ned.
- Oh, my God, are you...? Miranda.

705
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:25,575
- Here you go, there's $300. Go home.
- Wait, Miranda.

706
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:29,158
- Thank you so much.
- OK, I love that she paid you off,

707
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,573
but not, like, the full amount. [laughs]

708
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:35,209
Well, you know, she has her own way
of doing things.

709
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:36,540
They both do, I mean...

710
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,747
Hey, you wanna hear something weird?

711
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:41,749
Do you know that Dylan
shoots in the nude?

712
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,465
What? That's... disgusting.

713
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:47,597
Well, I mean, not all the time,
just certain situations.

714
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,599
Like, if Tatiana's nude,
then he has to be nude.

715
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:54,228
- It makes her feel more comfortable.
- Why is Tatiana naked?

716
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:55,934
Why is anybody naked?

717
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:59,442
It's to shoot her scars of oppression,
or something.

718
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,570
Oh, please. He's fucking her.

719
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:07,992
[sighs] Man, I had a feeling about that.

720
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:09,573
God, I just didn't want to believe it!

721
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:12,660
- [gasps]
- I mean, all those humanitarian awards.

722
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:16,292
I've got to call Nat. [gasps] Whoa!

723
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:20,129
Hey, Dune's on Showtime,
director's cut. You want...?

724
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:22,131
- Hey.
- Hey, hi.

725
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:25,760
Sorry, didn't know you... had company.

726
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:28,091
- No, he's nobody.
- If you're busy...

727
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:29,881
That's my brother, Ned.

728
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:32,096
- Oh, this is Ned?
- Yeah.

729
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,727
- Ned! Hey!
- Jeremy, Ned. Ned, Jeremy.

730
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:37,480
- Hey, man, Jeremy. Nice to meet you.
- How's it going? Nice to meet you.

731
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:39,311
You, too, Jeremy.
I'll watch Dune with you.

732
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:41,101
- Yeah? Me too.
- I love that movie.

733
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:45,613
"Father, the sleeper has awakened!"

734
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:47,445
You don't have to throw yourself
at him, Ned.

735
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:48,824
"Father!"

736
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:51,486
Hey, by the way, thanks for going
with Miranda to that benefit.

737
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:54,326
- She always makes me do that shit.
- Oh, hey, man, it's all good.

738
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:58,164
Jeremy finds it a burden to shave,
but he loves free food.

739
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:01,079
- That's true.
- [Ned] I had a great time, actually.

740
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:04,249
I tell you, that Arabella
she is one cool chick.

741
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:08,010
She's so pretty and so smart
and funny and strong.

742
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:11,969
My God, after everything she's been
through. All the humiliation with

743
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:15,635
- the South American guy, stabbing...
- Nat, oh, my God. Guess... Wait.

744
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:18,772
Hey, Miranda, do you have
any toothpaste I can borrow?

745
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,853
I'll call you back.
Ned, what did you just say?

746
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,017
I said, "Do you have
any toothpaste I can borrow?"

747
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:26,358
No, no, no. Arabella and a stabbing?

748
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:28,148
What did she tell you?

749
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:30,533
Oh, I don't know. it's kind of private.

750
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:33,319
- Ned, who just gave you $300?
- You.

751
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:36,035
Yeah. Plus, I feel like you
just wanted to tell us.

752
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:39,167
You were basically just practically
telling us the whole story.

753
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:42,249
Come on, Ned, spit it out.

754
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:45,002
Come on, Ned.

755
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:49,010
She was in South America, there was
a stabbing, just give us the rest of it.

Ned, why would I want a past lover
living in my backyard?

761
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:17,738
Billy said that you'd be cool with it.

762
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:21,079
Oh, fuck, man,
I totally forgot to ask her.

763
00:44:21,242 --> 00:44:23,540
That's my bad, man, all the way.

764
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:27,628
I understand. Look, you won't
even notice that I'm here.

765
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:30,760

it's not gonna happen.

768
00:44:35,256 --> 00:44:37,600
- Put Willie Nelson back in the house!
- What?

769
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:40,678
[Billy] Janet said no.

770
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:43,898
Sorry, man.

771
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:48,686
- Come on, Willie Nelson.
- You're not gonna let me see him?

772
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:51,777
You know what, I was hoping
I wouldn't have to say this,

773
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:54,067
but I don't think you've
given me any other choice.

774
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:58,947
How many times did you make me throw
Willie Nelson outside in the cold

775
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:02,117
because you didn't want
mud tracked in the house, huh?

776
00:45:02,283 --> 00:45:05,878
How many times did you insult him
by telling him he had bad breath?

777
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:09,382
Whoa, man, do you understand
that you come here to this farm,

778
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,965
you put Willie Nelson
in the middle of all your bullshit,

779
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:15,095
and you traumatize him.
Is that what you want?

780
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:17,632
Why can't you just let him live
with someone who loves him?

781
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:19,675
Stop with the violence, man!

782
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:22,436
- You made me raise my voice.
- [softly] Sorry.

783
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:25,519
I'm feel really affronted right now,
man, on my own property.

She's not even gonna budge unless
there's some sort of official action

790
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:59,883
or something. Is there any kind of
motion, or like injunction or something

791
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:01,551
that you can file? I mean...

792

I don't know. I don't want
to sound conceited or anything,

793
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,017
but I really am the better caregiver.

794
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:11,816
You can sue her, but I'm not gonna let
that hippie bitch put you through that.

795
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:13,195
You don't think we have a case?

796

I mean, she's splitting hairs
when she says

797
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:17,191
it was her friend Tim
that left him with us.

798
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:20,362
Look, you have a case,
but you don't need one.

799

That dog is yours and you're gonna go
back there and you're gonna get him.

I don't think I can ask her again, Cin.

No, no, no, Ned.

- No, say it... "I'm the man."

- You're the man! You're the man!

00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:53,003
Max and I think you're really cute.

827
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:55,206
Oh, uh...

828
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,633
Thanks.

829
00:47:58,292 --> 00:47:59,043
Thanks, Max.

830
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:11,893
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

831
00:48:25,194 --> 00:48:27,617
I'm sorry, I can't... I'm so sorry.

832
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,123
I can't do it.

833
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:32,876
I think your erection in my leg
totally threw me.

834
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:35,959
I'm so sorry, I'm really embarrassed.

835
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,672
I'm so... I'm so...

836
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:42,841
I'm sorry.

837
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:46,011
- I'm such a jerk.
- You're really not a jerk.

838
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:49,643
No, maybe I should've
tried harder or just...

839
00:48:50,136 --> 00:48:51,809
- You know.
- Ned.

840
00:48:51,971 --> 00:48:55,521
Dude, just 'cause you're straight
doesn't mean you're homophobic.

841
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:58,653
I just feel bad, you know?
They seemed pretty into me.

842
00:48:59,228 --> 00:49:02,323
Well, they'll get over it. Let's...

843
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:04,154
- We can look around this place.
- Thank you.

844
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:07,536
- You're welcome.
- Let's try and find you one woman.

845
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:11,537
- [Ned] Hm! She seems kind of fun.
- Yeah, sex would be awesome,

846
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:13,497
but then she'd make you
go to rock shows.

847
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:16,208
- Oh, sweet!
- Really?

848
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:20,466
Sweet? You'd be psyched
to go to some rock club?

849
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:23,468
See a band called, like, Paint Store...

850
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:25,880
- ...or something?
- [laughs] Not really.

851
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:27,889
No, you don't.

852
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:30,468
What about those ones over there?

853
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:33,057
[Jeremy] Lindsay and her friend,
they're gonna analyze every word

854
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,642
of every text you ever send her.

855
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:36,102
[Ned] I like the name Lindsay.

856
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:37,812
[Jeremy] But they're both named Lindsay.

857
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:41,479
Look what she's reading, it's like
a novelization of Us Weekly.

858
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:42,862
- [laughs]
- [Jeremy] Exhausting.

859
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:45,070
[Ned] Ooh, look at that one.
Look at that girl.

860
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:46,779
[Jeremy] Oh, yeah, that would be great,
if you wanted, you know,

861
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,535
to date your sister!

862
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:51,447
- What's wrong with my sister?
- Nothing's wrong with your sister.

863
00:49:51,614 --> 00:49:53,912
Why, you wanna date your sister?
You're a wild man.

864
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:56,577
No, I don't wanna date my sister.
But what about you?

865
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:59,246
- Me? Date your sister?
- Yeah. Right.

866
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:01,882
Miranda? What are you talking about?

867
00:50:02,041 --> 00:50:04,260
- Well, it's obvious.
- What's obvious?

868
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:06,466
That you guys totally love each other.

869
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:09,431
OK, I love Miranda, but...

870
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:11,433
- I know.
- ...she's bossy.

871
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:13,720
- [laughs] Yeah. She is.
- She's a bossy person.

872
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:17,766
She's like, "Jeremy, help me move
everything in my apartment around?

873
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:19,809
You know, it'll only take two minutes."
And then it's like...

874
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:21,522
- [laughs]
- ...all day.

875
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:24,655
I mean, she's great, she's pretty,
she's very pretty,

876
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:28,408
that's undeniable,
but relationship-wise and...

877
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:32,906
...pardon me, but sexually,
I don't know if I could deal with it.

878
00:50:33,072 --> 00:50:36,042
[sighs] Every man I meet
is either a dick or a loser.

879
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,875
What about Jeremy? He's not a dick.
And he's not a loser, either.

880
00:50:40,496 --> 00:50:42,999
Well, that's debatable,
he doesn't even have health insurance.

881
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:45,543
Neither do I,
at least I don't think I do.

882
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:48,879
- [man] Here you go.
- I just want to meet a real man, Ned.

883
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,640
I asked for that side-by-side,
not swirled. Thanks.

884
00:50:51,799 --> 00:50:52,800
- [man] Sure.
- Whatever.

885
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:55,686
I mean you two are obviously
not headed in that direction.

886
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:58,438
He thinks the idea
is as ludicrous as you do.

887
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:01,191
Hey, man, can I try some acai berry?

888
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:03,944
- [man] Yeah.
- Wait, wait. I'm sorry, what?

889
00:51:04,103 --> 00:51:07,152
- Why is that?
- I don't know, I don't know.

890
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:09,612
What he said, it didn't make any sense.

891
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:12,324
Why are we even talking about this?
Tell me what he said, Ned.

892
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:15,994
He said you can be a tad bossy.

893
00:51:16,407 --> 00:51:18,284
[laughs]

894
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:20,999
And you're not really his type,
physically. That was it, but...

895
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:23,755
- Wait, what?
- Hey, man, how's pomegranate?

896
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:26,337
- [man] it's terrific.
- Why, because I'm not 14?

897
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,127
- [man] How's that?
- [laughing]

898
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:30,046
Ned, tell me exactly what he said.

899
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:32,180
- God, do I have to?
- Yes.

900
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:50,316
[urinating]

901
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:57,076
[sighs] Fuck.

902
00:51:57,865 --> 00:52:00,368
[indistinct chatter]

903
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:06,420
- [Miranda] So, where's Dylan today?
- [Liz] He had to work.

904
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:11,758
He's been so edgy and... distant.

905
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:23,395
[sighs] Liz?

906
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:25,393
Yeah?

907
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:28,403
I think Dylan's having an affair.

908
00:52:30,356 --> 00:52:31,357
[laughs] What?

909
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,744
- What are you talking about?
- Ned told me.

910
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:38,247
Oh, yeah, OK, Ned. [scoffs]

911
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:39,998
Let's face it, I mean...

912
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:43,036
OK, Ned told me the facts.
I had to put it together.

913
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:47,590
He said that Dylan
was spending a lot of private time...

914
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:51,043
...with the woman in his film, Tatiana.

915
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:55,715
- Tatiana, she's...
- Naked.

916
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:01,429
Maybe it was some, like,
dance experiment or...

917
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,222
[Miranda] Liz...

918
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:12,485
- Do popcorn, Uncle Ned.
- In a minute, buddy.

919
00:53:12,648 --> 00:53:14,616
You sure she's gonna be at that concert?

920
00:53:14,775 --> 00:53:17,949
Yeah, she hasn't missed
a Dixie Chicks show in... ten years.

921
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:20,706
And you're sure that she's
gonna leave Willie Nelson behind?

922
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:23,663
According to Billy, she hasn't
taken him on an outing in months.

923
00:53:23,826 --> 00:53:26,045
- Poor guy.
- She's such a dick.

924
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:28,046
- [River] Come on, Uncle Ned.
- All right, Riv, let's go.

925
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,297
On your back.

926
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:35,884
- [River laughing]
- [Ned] Ah!

927
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:37,047
Yeah!

928
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:39,720
Yeah, baby!

929
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:43,888
[Miranda] His whole "I'm saving the
world" thing, it was bullshit, right?

930
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:46,603
- We always knew it. Fuck him.
- Yeah, fuck him.

931
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:48,813
And his little Russian
ballerina bitch.

932
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:52,355
This is the man I built my life with,
what do you expect?

933
00:53:52,521 --> 00:53:55,491
That I just... throw it all away
or something?

934
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:57,902
- No. I don't know.
- Maybe.

935
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,536
Damn Ned!

936
00:54:00,112 --> 00:54:02,956
- I never should have let him stay.
- This is not Ned's fault.

937
00:54:03,115 --> 00:54:04,992
Everything was going fine
until he arrived.

938
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:08,914
- [Miranda] How is this Ned's fault?
- A family is a very precarious thing.

939
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,673
You guys will see
when you get it together.

940
00:54:11,832 --> 00:54:13,584
[weeping]

941
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:17,008
OK, Liz, look.

942
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:18,673
Don't take this the wrong way,

943
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:22,514
because Dylan is totally
the asshole in this situation for sure.

944
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:25,304
- He's a douche bag.
- I hate his guts. But...

945
00:54:25,471 --> 00:54:27,439
...is it possible that...

946
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:30,817
...you know, maybe he
thought you gave up?

947
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,354
Gave up on what?

948
00:54:34,855 --> 00:54:36,232
You're, you know, this whole...

949
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:41,703
You used to be so hot, Liz. I remember
all my friends lusting after you.

950
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:44,035
- They thought you were awesome.
- Yes! You had the great boobs,

951
00:54:44,198 --> 00:54:46,542
- and you were always tall and...
- You're still tall.

952
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:50,204
- Yeah.
- Well, what's wrong with me now?

953
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:53,211
[Miranda] Well, come on...

954
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:57,094
Liz, I mean, look. I don't know.
What's going on with your hair here?

955
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:59,550
It's like a science experiment
back there.

956
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:03,592
And I know you own contacts.
You're wearing plastic shoes,

957
00:55:03,759 --> 00:55:05,932
and what is this shirt even made of?

958
00:55:06,929 --> 00:55:09,808
- it's flax.
- See? I mean, isn't that a food?

959
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:12,442
- You're wearing food.
- What are you saying?

960
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:15,480
- If only I looked more like you?
- What? No.

961
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:21,073
Got my hair styled every day and wore
absurd heels that no one can walk in,

962
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:24,079
that maybe my husband wouldn't
be screwing around on me?!

963
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:26,957
I'm just trying to help!
OK, Liz? That's all!

964
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:29,209
I hardly think you're in a position
to give man advice!

965
00:55:29,368 --> 00:55:31,587
Jesus Christ, you guys,
all Miranda's saying is just,

966
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,998
like, maybe it would be cool
if you just, like,

967
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,757
looked semi-fuckable once in a while.

968
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:37,793
- Thank you!
- Oh, God!

969
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:40,088
I mean, how long has it been
since you've had sex?

970
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:43,554
I don't know! Echo's five months,
so, you know...

971
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:45,513
- Plus nine, it's like...
- What?!

972
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:47,428
- Plus nine?!
- Are you kidding me?

973
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:51,474
That's, like, over a year!
How can people live like that? That's...

974
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,267
I am different from you.

975
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:56,607
I have other things to do than
worry about getting my rocks off.

976
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:59,489
[scoffs] What is that supposed to mean?
You think I'm sleeping around?

977
00:55:59,648 --> 00:56:01,776
- I'm not sleeping around!
- Nobody thinks that.

978
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:03,910
- I didn't say that.
- I love Cindy.

979
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:07,369
- This isn't about you, Nat!
- it's just seduction is your thing,

980
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:10,080
- your means to self-esteem.
- Ohh!

981
00:56:10,242 --> 00:56:12,461
- I don't care!
- Screw you and screw you!

982
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:15,498
What did I do? Nat!
What is up your ass?!

983
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:22,220
Babe, you OK?

984
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:25,052
- You're all sweaty.
- Babe.

985
00:56:25,674 --> 00:56:29,304
[Ned] They just dump everything on it,
sprinkles and like Oreos.

986
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:34,020
- What about sunflower seeds?
- They're actually good.

987
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:35,308
- They're good?
- Yeah.

988
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:36,476
- What about...
- [crying] River, come on.

989
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:37,815
Sweetie, come on.

990
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:40,401
Come on, it's time to go, come on.
[sniffles]

991
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:41,907
Come on.

992
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:44,193
- See ya, buddy.
- See ya.

993
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,866
Hey, Riv, check it out.

994
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:49,994
[laughing]

995
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:52,159
Grow the hell up, Ned.

996
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:00,587
[elevator dings]

997
00:57:04,004 --> 00:57:07,053
Hey, read it last night.
Quite the story.

998
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:10,344
PR thinks it's gonna get you
on a bunch of talk shows.

999
00:57:13,722 --> 00:57:15,520
[Miranda]
Oh, now you're MIC Moral High Ground?

1000
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:16,808
[Jeremy] No, I didn't say anything.

1001
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:21,105
I love my brother, but let's be honest,
he doesn't live in the adult world.

1002
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:25,071
Oh, but your story's adult
with all the gory details

1003
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:28,954
- and bitching aside?
- Sometimes in the adult world

1004
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:31,956
we have to do things that,
you know, we're not very pro...

1005
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:34,209
Let's just drop it,
because you wouldn't understand.

1006
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:36,871
I wouldn't understand?
Why wouldn't I understand?

1007
00:57:37,037 --> 00:57:39,005
Why, because I'm an unpublished
sci-fi writer?

1008
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:42,464
- What? Don't be ridiculous.
- Oh, no, that's not it. That's not it.

1009
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:46,005
It's because I don't have health
insurance. That's what it was.

1010
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:49,675
- Did Ned...? I'm gonna murder him.
- I don't know how I found that out.

1011
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:52,560
- He's...
- Are you helping at all?

1012
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:54,721
- I'm guiding it.
- You're guiding it?

1013
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:58,188
- Someone has to guide...
- Let go. You weren't doing anything.

1014
00:57:58,350 --> 00:58:01,194
- That's what he said?
- [Miranda] Hey, Ned!

1015
00:58:01,353 --> 00:58:04,527
Really? You had to go and tell Jeremy
about that little stupid thing I said

1016
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:07,318
about the health insurance?
Why are you such a blabbermouth?

1017
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:10,408
Is that my brush? Ew!
What are you doing?

1018
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:11,787
I don't wanna know.

1019
00:58:11,947 --> 00:58:13,073
Uh...

1020
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:16,961
I'm surprised that you even asked
my opinion on your work,

1021
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:20,589
since... Wait, I'm not even a grown-up?
Is that what it was?

1022
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:22,340
Ned! That...

1023
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:25,218
OK, what you don't understand
is that my brother is a retard.

1024
00:58:25,377 --> 00:58:26,424
- [Jeremy] Oh, OK.
- That's true.

1025
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:27,712
[Miranda] See? Thank you.

1026
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:31,099
No, I mean, she didn't say that at all.

1027
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:33,260
What she was that
you're not like a real man.

1028
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:35,224
- Ned! Wait!
- That's much better.

1029
00:58:35,387 --> 00:58:37,606
- No...
- That's great. Thank you, Miranda.

1030
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:40,438
Oh, no, no, no, no! This is just...

1031
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,694
This is just a breakdown
of communication.

1032
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:45,527
- Obviously. Really nice, Miranda.
- Don't try to make me feel bad

1033
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:49,410
about any of this when, according
to you, I'm... What was it, Ned?

1034
00:58:49,568 --> 00:58:52,117
- ...hideously ugly.
- What?

1035
00:58:52,279 --> 00:58:53,747
- Yeah.
- I didn't say that.

1036
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:55,748
Miranda, I would never
say that about you.

1037
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:59,081
- He so didn't say that about you.
- Thank you, tell her I didn't say that.

1038
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:02,544
He said your personality gets in the way
of your looks, your very good looks.

1039
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:05,380
Dude... do you have Tourettes?

1040
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:07,636
- What the fuck?
- Wow.

1041
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:09,296
This is much worse
than I thought it was.

1042
00:59:09,463 --> 00:59:11,966
- I didn't say that.
- I don't even know why I care.

1043
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:14,976
Because the idea of the two of you
sitting around, talking about girls,

1044
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:17,263
is so pathetic, it's almost funny.

1045
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:18,772
It's almost funny?

1046
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:20,352
I don't see you laughing right now.

1047
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:22,984
It doesn't seem like
you think it's funny at all.

1048
00:59:24,186 --> 00:59:27,065
OK, um, here's your story.

1049
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:30,655
Thank you for letting me read
your wonderful article.

1050
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:33,495
Hope you sleep well. Ned, you might
wanna take a look at that.

1051
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:36,532
- See you later.
- Jer.

1052
00:59:38,158 --> 00:59:39,876
- Give me that, Ned!
- [door slams]

1053
00:59:40,035 --> 00:59:41,503
[sighs]

1054
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:45,833
Keep your mouth shut, Ned,
just keep it shut!

1055
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:47,672
- Sorry.
- He's like my best friend.

1056
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:49,962
- Thanks a lot!
- I'm sorry.

1057
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:53,723
This is like in prison
when I told Bob about Jose.

1058
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:56,810
I'm pretty sure it's nothing like that.

1059
00:59:56,968 --> 01:00:01,519
I mean, is there anything
more bothersome than a morn clich?

1060
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:03,683
Mom's heart is in the right place.

1061
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:05,022
- Mom means well.
- [chuckles]

1062
01:00:05,185 --> 01:00:09,691
Or, the crowning glory
of terrible mom clichs...

1063
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:13,531
I mean...

1064
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:16,701
Um...

1065
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:20,124
I'm gonna be...

1066
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:24,170
...right back.

1067
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:35,473
[Natalie] What?

1068
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,430
Nat, are you all right?

1069
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:42,976
Are you sick?

1070
01:00:50,397 --> 01:00:52,900
- I'm pregnant.
- What?

1071
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:56,161
Oh, my God, that...!
Congratulations, man!

1072
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,447
That's so awesome for you guys.

1073
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:01,200
God, what do I fucking do?

1074
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:04,752
Well... this sounds weird,

1075
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:07,084
but do you think you're not as much
of a lesbian as you thought?

1076
01:01:07,247 --> 01:01:12,003
No! No, it was just a thing.
God, I fucking love Cindy.

1077
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:15,130
You know... just tell her the truth.

1078
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:18,425
She loves you.
Maybe she'll be psyched to have a kid.

1079
01:01:18,592 --> 01:01:20,310
What? Yeah,
she's gonna be really psyched.

1080
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:24,063
She's gonna come with me to pick out
a fucking changing table. Come on!

1081
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:27,442
I cheated on her, I got pregnant,
she should be pissed.

1082
01:01:27,601 --> 01:01:29,399
I don't Wanna fuck it up with her, Ned.

1083
01:01:29,561 --> 01:01:31,279
If she loves you, she'll forgive you.

1084
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:34,983
I can't have this child.

1085
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:37,326
[moans]

1086
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:40,705
- Holy shit, I've destroyed my life.
- [thunder rumbles]

1087
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:46,791
- You're having an affair, aren't you?
- [chuckles]

1088
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:50,958
- With Tatiana.
- With Tatiana, are you crazy?

1089
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:53,593
Who gave you that idea?

1090
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:57,506
- Your ludicrous brother?
- What does it matter?

1091
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:01,302
Apparently, you're shooting
the movie naked.

1092
01:02:01,468 --> 01:02:04,142
- What?
- Even the way you say her name.

1093
01:02:04,304 --> 01:02:06,727
- [scoffs]
- Tatiana.

1094
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:09,484
You know, you have
this amazing talent

1095
01:02:09,643 --> 01:02:11,611
for making me feel
like a second-class citizen.

1096
01:02:12,312 --> 01:02:17,239
- What do you mean?
- I mean, in your own meek, mousy way

1097
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:21,371
you have this brilliant knack
of getting your own way.

1098
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:24,912
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

1099
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:30,088
[sobs] Wait, what does this
have to do with you and Tatiana?

1100
01:02:30,247 --> 01:02:32,875
I never wanted him here,
but you insisted that he stay,

1101
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:36,796
even making me feel like a criminal for
suggesting that he stay somewhere else.

1102
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:41,138
This is bullshit, Dylan.
You're completely evading the issue!

1103
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:44,811
It's not a trick question.
Are you or aren't you sleeping with her?

1104
01:02:46,805 --> 01:02:47,852
[sighs]

1105
01:02:57,732 --> 01:02:59,359
What are you doing?

1106
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:02,871
I'm leaving this house
before you make me lose my temper

1107
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:04,781
in front of my children.

1108
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:09,619
[sighs]

1109
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:18,636
You couldn't wear pants, Ned?

1110
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:21,469
OK, I took the liberty
of writing up a checklist,

1111
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:23,850
if you could read it over carefully,
please.

1112
01:03:24,009 --> 01:03:25,261
That's just the checklist, Ned.

1113
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:33,151
Wait, you put all
of this in your article?

1114
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:35,563
- That stuff was private.
- Well...

1115
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:37,606
Did she ever say it was off the record?

1116
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:40,696
Why would she say it was off the record,
we were just having a conversation.

1117
01:03:40,859 --> 01:03:44,784
Ned, come on, she knew
you and I were a team.

1118
01:03:45,405 --> 01:03:47,533
She called us a team
the first time that we met.

1119
01:03:47,699 --> 01:03:49,246
Yeah, and then you said
we weren't a team.

1120
01:03:49,409 --> 01:03:51,082
- No, I didn't.
- Yeah, you did.

1121
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:53,872
I remember precisely,
'cause I thought it was pretty mean.

1122
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:56,133
I dropped everything
to drive you around that day.

1123
01:03:56,291 --> 01:03:58,259
All the documentary guys
were going for dim sum.

1124
01:03:58,418 --> 01:04:01,467
You know what?
The important thing at this point

1125
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:04,929
is whether this information is true.

1126
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:06,968
It's all we need to know, Ned.

1127
01:04:07,135 --> 01:04:08,762
Is this true?

1128
01:04:12,307 --> 01:04:13,934
I'm gonna bring Darren in on this.

1129
01:04:18,313 --> 01:04:21,066
Fuck. Fuckity-fuck, Ned,
she's getting a lawyer.

1130
01:04:21,232 --> 01:04:23,735
How could you do this to a person?
That's so messed up.

1131
01:04:23,902 --> 01:04:28,703
How can you do this to me?
Just say "Yes, this happened."

1132
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:32,119
You're not even lying or anything.
It is true, so just...

1133
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:36,461
Fuck. Look, Ned, I am begging you.
Don't fucking do this to me, please?

1134
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:38,876
Come on. All right, here they come.

1135
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:40,419
Hi, Darren, how are you?

1136
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:45,557
Ah. I'm not happy at the way this
story's been put together, Miranda.

1137
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:46,932
[Robbie] I'm not either.

1138
01:04:47,092 --> 01:04:49,595
You'll have to vouch for the veracity
of the story yourself, Ned.

1139
01:04:49,761 --> 01:04:52,310
- Like right now?
- That's right. Right now.

1140
01:04:52,472 --> 01:04:54,099
I need to hear it.

1141
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:58,277
[sighs]

1142
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:05,656
- Hey, Miranda.
- Hey, Ted.

1143
01:05:17,956 --> 01:05:19,708
- What the fuck is Wrong with you?
- Ahh!

1144
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:22,423
- You couldn't just fucking say yes?
- Sorry.

1145
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:24,553
How could you do that to me, Ned?

1146
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:25,756
[elevator dings]

1147
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:28,971
[scoffs] Miranda's such a bitch
sometimes.

1148
01:05:29,134 --> 01:05:32,138
I feel kind of bad,
it was a big opportunity for her.

1149
01:05:32,303 --> 01:05:34,806
For what?
Selling her soul for a story?

1150
01:05:34,973 --> 01:05:37,351
There was just
a breakdown of communication.

1151
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:38,939
Whatever.

1152
01:05:39,102 --> 01:05:42,948
Looks like you found a use for
your mom's post 9/11 escape raft.

1153
01:05:43,106 --> 01:05:44,699
It's cool. Sleep well, bud.

1154
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:50,204
- Tomorrow, Operation Free Willie.
- Right on.

1155
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:52,032
Have a good night.

1156
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:54,701
If you get cold,
there are coats up in the...

1157
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:56,836
- Oh, OK.
- Oh, and if you need to pee?

1158
01:05:56,995 --> 01:05:59,623
- There's a kitty litter box right here.
- [laughs]

1159
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:02,008
Nat.

1160
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:06,175
- [whispers] How's it going?
- Oh. Great.

1161
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:09,056
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Thanks so much for your advice.

1162
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:11,889
- Oh, my God. For sure. No.
- That was awesome.

1163
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:15,521
I mean, she's being exceptionally cool.

1164
01:06:16,556 --> 01:06:19,560
She is exceptionally cool.

1165
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:22,855
- [Cindy] Nat, where are my ear plugs?
- Night, Ned.

1166
01:06:23,563 --> 01:06:24,860
Night, Nat.

1167
01:06:25,023 --> 01:06:25,990
[# Willie Nelson: "OI' Blue"]

1168
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:28,618
# I had a dog

1169
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:31,746
# And his name was Blue

1170
01:06:31,905 --> 01:06:34,408
# I'll tell you what

1171
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:37,919
# OI' Blue would do

1172
01:06:38,077 --> 01:06:40,171
# Yeah, Blue

1173
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:43,004
# Yeah, Blue
Yeah, Blue

1174
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:46,924
# He'd go out

1175
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:50,090
# Every night about dark

1176
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:52,930
# And it wouldn't be long

1177
01:06:53,092 --> 01:06:55,220
# 'Til you'd hear him bark

1178
01:06:56,888 --> 01:06:59,016
# Yeah, Blue

1179
01:06:59,182 --> 01:07:01,310
# Yeah, Blue
Yeah, Blue #

1180
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:13,905
[engine shuts off]

1181
01:07:15,073 --> 01:07:16,950
[Ned] No way, they're home!

1182
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:18,959
Jesus, what do we do?

1183
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:21,416
We go get Willie Nelson.

1184
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:26,130
[Billy] Are you mad about
the rooster thing?

1185
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:28,465
[Janet] Well, a little bit mad
about the fucking rooster.

1186
01:07:28,628 --> 01:07:30,676
[Billy] Well, I'm telling you,
he's depressed.

1187
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:34,468
And I'm telling you, there's no fucking
way a rooster is depressed, Billy.

1188
01:07:34,634 --> 01:07:38,730
[Billy] When animals are depressed, man,
they, like, sleep more.

1189
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:40,390
[whispers] Sorry, didn't mean to touch
your boob.

1190
01:07:40,557 --> 01:07:44,437
[Billy] Humans do it, roosters do it,
then they don't crow in the morning.

1191
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:46,229
- That's why I overslept.
- I'm so psyched

1192
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:50,572
- you and Nat weathered that storm.
- Yeah, We're good. We're good.

1193
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:53,987
And to power through infidelity,
man, you can do that,

1194
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:55,826
you can do anything.

1195
01:07:55,989 --> 01:07:57,491
Oh, come on!

1196
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:03,834
Locked? She locked it?

1197
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:06,632
Hold on. Right here.

1198
01:08:11,671 --> 01:08:13,844
[grunts]

1199
01:08:16,134 --> 01:08:17,602
Come in.

1200
01:08:20,013 --> 01:08:24,189
Hey, you know, that Christian, he's kind
of lame, but he's really handsome.

1201
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:27,024
So there's a good chance your baby
is going to be very striking.

1202
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:29,780
- [barking]
- Oh!

1203
01:08:32,066 --> 01:08:33,613
Buddy!

1204
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:35,619
[kissing] I missed you so much!

1205
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:38,782
Hey, Nat. Oh, no,
I'm just with your brother

1206
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:42,043
and he just told me some real
interesting news.

1207
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:43,202
- No!
- Nothing,

1208
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:45,212
just that you're apparently pregnant

1209
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:49,421
with the spawn
of that fucking cult-y fuck fuck!

1210
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:53,213
- [barking]
- Yeah, sure. She wants to talk to you.

1211
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:55,052
- [barking]
- [Ned whispering] No, no.

1212
01:08:55,882 --> 01:08:58,556
- Hello?
- Oh, shoot.

1213
01:08:58,718 --> 01:09:02,313
- Hey, Nat. Now's not a great time.
- [Janet] Who's here?

1214
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:03,689
Janet, hey, what's up?

1215
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:07,227
- Can I call you back?
- Jesus Christ.

1216
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:10,021
- Yeah, it's me!
- What's going on, how's it going?

1217
01:09:10,188 --> 01:09:13,567
- [Cindy] You don't sound very sorry!
- You thought you'd come and take him?

1218
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:16,202
- Who the fuck is this?
- [Cindy] You're gonna blame Ned?

1219
01:09:16,361 --> 01:09:18,489
That's your tactic? [laughs]

1220
01:09:18,655 --> 01:09:21,955
OK, I really didn't want to get
litigious, but I brought a lawyer.

1221
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:26,462
[Cindy] I am sorry I don't have a fat,
throbbing cock for you!

1222
01:09:26,621 --> 01:09:28,544
That's some Ivy League
shit out there, man.

1223
01:09:28,706 --> 01:09:30,379
- [Cindy] Really?
- Cindy!

1224
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:34,512
You wouldn't, would you, Nat? 'Cause
you're fucking selfish, that's why.

1225
01:09:34,671 --> 01:09:37,094
No, no, no! I wanna
talk about this now, damn it!

1226
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:39,805
- I need your help, Cindy. Could you...?
- Really? An accident?!

1227
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:42,470
An accident is when you
fall off your fucking bike!

1228
01:09:42,637 --> 01:09:45,106
- Not when you fuck somebody!
- Hey, Ned. What's up, man?

1229
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:48,768
- Hey, man.
- Caught the master criminal here

1230
01:09:48,935 --> 01:09:51,108
trying to steal Willie Nelson.

1231
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:54,274
What happened
to the Dixie Chicks show?

1232
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:58,411
The Dixie Chicks? That's next Thursday.

1233
01:09:58,569 --> 01:10:00,367
- Right, Janet?
- Yeah.

1234
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:02,874
- Next Thursday.
- When I talked to you last week,

1235
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:07,287
- you said it was next Thursday.
- Oh. It is. Next Thursday.

1236
01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:09,922
Yeah, but when I talked to you a week
ago, you said "Next Thursday."

1237
01:10:10,081 --> 01:10:11,253
I'm thinking, today.

1238
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:13,794
So it's better for you
if I say "Next, next Thursday"?

1239
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:16,713
It's not better now. I thought you were
gonna be at the Dixie Chicks concert.

1240
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:21,305
Yeah, but just for future reference,
like for concerts in the future.

1241
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:23,310
- What, are you guys fucking?
- [car door slams]

1242
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:26,769
Oh, God! Cindy! Cindy!

1243
01:10:28,808 --> 01:10:32,358
Oh! Dude! Man, there goes my ride.

1244
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:35,945
That's OK, I can give you a lift.
Or no, I can't.

1245
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:40,954
This can't be happening.

1246
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:45,333
I never should have let Ned stay here.

1247
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:47,084
What about what Ned did to me?

1248
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:51,168
I take him to work, he hangs me
out to dry in front of everyone.

1249
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:54,174
Hang on,
I'm getting call waiting. Hello?

1250
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:57,883
Our idiot brother
just ruined my fucking life.

1251
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:02,509
You know you'll always
have a place here with me.

1252
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:04,552
Thanks, Mom.

1253
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:07,351
I thought the girls
wouldn't want you hanging around,

1254
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:11,313
they've got too much stuff going on
to bother with people like us.

1255
01:11:16,022 --> 01:11:17,865
All right then, that's it.

1256
01:11:18,024 --> 01:11:20,072
I will see you in three weeks.

1257
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:23,822
Hey, you know,
I've been meaning to tell you.

1258
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:26,286
You're doing
a really good thing here, Omar.

1259
01:11:26,449 --> 01:11:30,545
- [laughs]
- Seriously. You talk to us screw-ups,

1260
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:33,331
you give us a reason
for getting out of bed in the morning.

1261
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:35,795
Thanks, man.

1262
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:38,962
So you get out of bed again
in another three weeks, OK?

1263
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:41,631
- [Chuckles] I'll do it.
- I appreciate the compliment.

1264
01:11:41,798 --> 01:11:44,472
It's rare that we get love
from the clients.

1265
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:46,557
Well, you're a good dude.

1266
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:50,099
And I just needed this appointment
today, I'm having a tough go of it.

1267
01:11:50,264 --> 01:11:55,486
I swear, I try and do good,
but I just screw it up.

1268
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:59,194
Man, I screwed it up with my sisters,
I'm back living with my mom.

1269
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:02,736
On top of it all, I broke down
and smoked a joint

1270
01:12:02,902 --> 01:12:04,404
with the kid that lives
across the street.

1271
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:05,992
OK, I didn't just hear that.

1272
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:09,580
I said I broke down and smoked a joint
with the kid who lives across...

1273
01:12:09,742 --> 01:12:12,211
What are you doing?
Hey! Ned, why are you telling me this?

1274
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:15,465
I just need to unload, man.
That's part of why I'm here, right?

1275
01:12:15,623 --> 01:12:20,003
I'm not your therapist, Ned. You don't
tell your parole officer you got high.

1276
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:23,423
Now I have to report you
or else I could lose my job.

1277
01:12:25,883 --> 01:12:29,763
Seriously? Can you forget I said that?

1278
01:12:32,056 --> 01:12:34,434
- No, Ned, I can't.
- Oh, fuck.

1279
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:35,897
[sighs]

1280
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:37,562
[toilet flushing]

1281
01:12:39,522 --> 01:12:40,569
You OK?

1282
01:12:42,066 --> 01:12:43,943
[mother] it's an ulcer, I'm telling you.

1283
01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:45,783
Too many late nights.

1284
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:48,039
Did you call Dr. Silverman?

1285
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:49,949
I Will.

1286
01:12:51,158 --> 01:12:54,458
Oh, yeah,
it's my fault you're throwing up.

1287
01:12:55,246 --> 01:12:57,624
- [mother] Who's ready for charades?
- Me!

1288
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:00,634
Mom, nobody's in the mood.

1289
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:02,841
[mother] Great,
go and get the pens and paper.

1290
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:05,507
Television show.

1291
01:13:05,673 --> 01:13:07,095
Three words.

1292
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:11,183
Gimme A Break.

1293
01:13:12,555 --> 01:13:15,104
- That was quick.
- I put it in.

1294
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:16,767
All right, guys.

1295
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:20,028
River, this one's for you.

1296
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:23,657
All right, River, come on!
Here we go!

1297
01:13:28,571 --> 01:13:29,823
Wizard of Oz.

1298
01:13:29,989 --> 01:13:32,742
- Yeah.
- [Liz] Well done, sweetie.

1299
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:36,212
I guess it's me.

1300
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:41,671
OK, it's a movie.

1301
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:44,090
Space?

1302
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:45,971
Space, space, Star Wars!

1303
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:48,553
- Space... No.
- [River] Space Frogs!

1304
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:51,344
- Crazy Hands!
- Good, Crazy Hands?

1305
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:54,104
Crazy Heart.
"Crazy Little Thing Called Love."

1306
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:57,016
- Uncle Ned!
- Me. Ned, Ned. Nedly, Nedrick.

1307
01:13:57,183 --> 01:14:00,312
- Me, me, Ned!
- Why aren't you guys guessing?

1308
01:14:00,478 --> 01:14:02,526
- The Jerk?
- Har har.

1309
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:04,531
- OK, guys, come on, guys.
- Jackass.

1310
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:06,692
[Natalie] You wanna get in on this
party, Liz?

1311
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:09,362
The Man Who Just Ruined My Marriage.

1312
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:13,165
Don't forget Lassie.
'Cause you miss your doggie.

1313
01:14:13,324 --> 01:14:14,371
- Ha ha ha ha.
- [girls laughing]

1314
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:18,379
- Can you please just play the game?
- We are playing.

1315
01:14:18,537 --> 01:14:20,130
No, you're not playing,
you're not at all.

1316
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:21,211
- We are.
- [Ned] No, you're not.

1317
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:23,251
- Yeah, we're kind of playing.
- [Ned] You're kind of not playing.

1318
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:26,717
- Those were great guesses, I thought.
- When you put your own clue in,

1319
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:28,301
you're not allowed to guess.
You know that.

1320
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:30,887
- I bent the rules.
- You didn't bend the rules.

1321
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:35,351
You broke them and that just
ruins it for everyone, all right?

1322
01:14:35,513 --> 01:14:36,935
I know you've got a really
important life, Miranda,

1323
01:14:37,098 --> 01:14:41,399
but some of us like to sit around, enjoy
our family, and play a game of charades.

1324
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:42,982
[laughing]

1325
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:45,898
What's so funny, Nat?
By the way, when a kid goes,

1326
01:14:46,065 --> 01:14:48,818
you should at least give him
the opportunity to act out his hint.

1327
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:51,579
All right? Before you jump in
with the answer, even if you know it.

1328
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:55,082
It's the same stupid clue
Mom always puts in for River.

1329
01:14:55,241 --> 01:14:58,916
So what? You're so cool,
you're just too bored, is that it?!

1330
01:14:59,078 --> 01:15:01,752
For God's sake, Ned, we have
other things on our mind.

1331
01:15:01,914 --> 01:15:03,257
So you make it miserable for everybody?

1332
01:15:03,416 --> 01:15:06,420
- OK, Ned, we're gonna play.
- Let's get serious, girls.

1333
01:15:06,585 --> 01:15:07,928
Just play the fucking game!

1334
01:15:08,087 --> 01:15:09,384
[chatter silences]

1335
01:15:10,923 --> 01:15:14,553
Goddamn it, I just want
to sit around with my family

1336
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:16,562
and play a fucking game of charades!

1337
01:15:27,273 --> 01:15:29,571
I just wanna sit
and I just wanna play the game.

1338
01:15:29,734 --> 01:15:31,452
I wanna play charades,
what's the big deal about that?

1339
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:33,658
Why can't you all just play?

1340
01:15:37,283 --> 01:15:39,832
[doorbell rings]

1341
01:15:39,994 --> 01:15:41,291
Sorry, Riv.

1342
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:47,965
- [Omar] Hello, Mrs. Rochlin?
- Yes.

1343
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:51,388
Officer Omar Coleman. Is your son home?

1344
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:54,471
He was just frustrated, officer.

1345
01:15:54,633 --> 01:15:57,307
He gets very excited
playing parlor games.

1346
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:59,188
It's under control now.

1347
01:15:59,346 --> 01:16:00,973
- Oh, my God.
- Omar.

1348
01:16:03,017 --> 01:16:06,567
Mr. Rochlin, sir,
I suggest you step outside.

1349
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:09,365
[Miranda] What's going on?

1350
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:15,537
- [man] Nedrick Rochlin?
- Yeah.

1351
01:16:16,155 --> 01:16:19,625
- You made bail.
- Really? Who?

1352
01:16:21,327 --> 01:16:25,002
Miranda Rochlin. Just sign here,
we'll process you out.

1353
01:16:33,631 --> 01:16:35,850
- No, I'm good.
- What?

1354
01:16:36,008 --> 01:16:37,851
No, thanks. I'm gonna stay here, man.

1355
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:39,353
Thank you.

1356
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:46,735
Look, there's nothing I can do.
He refused to sign.

1357
01:16:46,894 --> 01:16:49,522
- This is classic Ned.
- Officer, I'm his mother.

1358
01:16:49,688 --> 01:16:52,862
Just bring him out here.
He probably doesn't understand the form.

1359
01:16:53,025 --> 01:16:54,572
That's not how we do it, ma'am.

1360
01:16:55,486 --> 01:16:58,410
- Can I speak to your supervisor?
- No.

1361
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:01,868
Mom, if he doesn't want to be
released to us, we can't force him.

1362
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:06,005
Excuse me, sir, would it be possible
for my son to see him?

1363
01:17:07,373 --> 01:17:10,877
I know you're really mad at my mom
and Aunt Natalie and Aunt Miranda.

1364
01:17:11,043 --> 01:17:13,546
But they all feel really sorry, I swear.

1365
01:17:15,256 --> 01:17:18,726
River, I want you to go tell your mom
and your aunts something for me, OK?

1366
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:20,136
Sure, Uncle Ned.

1367
01:17:20,845 --> 01:17:23,394
- Go fuck yourselves.
- River!

1368
01:17:23,556 --> 01:17:25,729
That's what he said.

1369
01:17:34,567 --> 01:17:38,071
Hey guys, I know how to get Uncle Ned
to leave prison.

1370
01:18:06,015 --> 01:18:07,392
- Well, hello.
- [engine shuts off]

1371
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:11,437
- Hi.
- [Janet] The Rochlin girls.

1372
01:18:12,146 --> 01:18:15,696
This is a pleasant
and unexpected surprise.

1373
01:18:15,858 --> 01:18:19,283
- The farm looks beautiful, Janet.
- Oh, thanks, Liz.

1374
01:18:19,445 --> 01:18:22,995
So, what brings you all up here?

1375
01:18:23,407 --> 01:18:24,408
Um...

1376
01:18:27,578 --> 01:18:29,626
We were practically family, Janet.

1377
01:18:29,788 --> 01:18:32,712
And we thought... um...

1378
01:18:34,043 --> 01:18:36,387
...it would be good
to get some closure, you know?

1379
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:38,297
Yeah, that and we came for Ned's dog.

1380
01:18:38,464 --> 01:18:42,185
[laughs] So he roped
the whole family in, huh?

1381
01:18:43,344 --> 01:18:46,143
Well, forget it.
Willie Nelson isn't leaving.

1382
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:48,144
It's what's best for him.

1383
01:18:48,307 --> 01:18:52,028
Janet, Ned needs
Willie Nelson's company right now.

1384
01:18:53,479 --> 01:18:55,322
- Emotionally...
- Look,

1385
01:18:55,481 --> 01:18:58,485
I'm not giving that
irresponsible man-child my dog.

1386
01:18:58,651 --> 01:19:00,449
Come on, Janet, it's just a dog.

1387
01:19:00,611 --> 01:19:02,989
Uh... to you, maybe, Natalie.

1388
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:05,157
To me, Willie Nelson
is a dear, dear friend.

1389
01:19:05,324 --> 01:19:07,827
- That is a load of crap, Janet.
- I love that dog!

1390
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:11,918
Nobody loves that dog
the way Ned loves that dog.

1391
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:16,803
Nobody loves anything
as unconditionally as Ned loves.

1392
01:19:20,005 --> 01:19:21,097
[93593]

1393
01:19:21,257 --> 01:19:22,975
He's in jail, Janet.

1394
01:19:23,133 --> 01:19:24,680
- [Janet] Oh, my God.
- He needs our help.

1395
01:19:24,843 --> 01:19:26,311
That was fast.
What did he do this time?

1396
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:30,441
He didn't do shit.
We put him there, all of us.

1397
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:32,021
Including you, Janet.

1398
01:19:32,184 --> 01:19:35,028
I am not gonna stand here
and be insulted on my own porch.

1399
01:19:35,187 --> 01:19:38,987
- I'll insult you right here.
- I'm a pacifist. I don't play that way.

1400
01:19:39,149 --> 01:19:41,652
I'm gonna peace you in the side of
the head if you don't give us the dog.

1401
01:19:41,819 --> 01:19:44,493
I'm not gonna receive that
with anything but love.

1402
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:46,748
We are not leaving.

1403
01:19:51,287 --> 01:19:53,130
OK, I love that tactic.

1404
01:19:55,082 --> 01:19:57,176
Billy, get me the phone.

1405
01:19:59,503 --> 01:20:03,178
Jenny, where's the dog bowl
that he loves so much?

1406
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:05,593
- Billy, what are you doing?
- Let's go. Come on.

1407
01:20:05,759 --> 01:20:09,138
- What are you doing?
- Hey, it's his dog, man.

1408
01:20:09,305 --> 01:20:13,185
Billy, put the dog in the house.
Put the dog in the house, Billy!

1409
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:15,978
Ilene, you can't take this dog!
This is his home!

1410
01:20:16,145 --> 01:20:18,898
Go back to your fruits
and vegetables, honey.

1411
01:20:19,064 --> 01:20:20,907
William! Billy!

1412
01:20:21,066 --> 01:20:23,569
What the fuck are you doing?
Get the dog!

1413
01:20:23,736 --> 01:20:27,457
- Hey, easy language, man.
- [dog barking]

1414
01:20:27,614 --> 01:20:30,288
- Tell Ned we said, "Hey."
- [Miranda] Thanks, Billy.

1415
01:20:34,747 --> 01:20:36,920
[dog barking]

1416
01:20:40,085 --> 01:20:42,258
Willie! Willie!

1417
01:20:42,421 --> 01:20:44,469
Oh, thank God, Willie Nelson!

1418
01:20:44,631 --> 01:20:46,599
Yeah, buddy! Willie!

1419
01:20:46,759 --> 01:20:48,602
- [barking]
- Yeah! Hey, buddy!

1420
01:20:48,761 --> 01:20:51,685
# When you're hot and you're
cold, not always easy to hold

1421
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:54,100
# And you're hard to impress

1422
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:56,519
# Sounds funny
But you might be the best

1423
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:57,777
Want some?

1424
01:20:57,936 --> 01:21:01,531
- # Thing that I have
- Not the whole thing! [laughs]

1425
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:04,785
I 'Cause whenever you've gone
and I'm left all alone

01:21:04,943 --> 01:21:07,366
# Well, the world
seems worse

01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:10,499
# No, I didn't really
like you at first

1428
01:21:10,657 --> 01:21:12,955
# I was wrong about that

1429
01:21:13,952 --> 01:21:17,126
# So wherever I go

1430
01:21:17,289 --> 01:21:19,667
# I'm taking you with me

1431
01:21:20,626 --> 01:21:23,550
# Wherever I go

1432
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:27,262
# You're coming along

1433
01:21:28,926 --> 01:21:31,429
Hey, Jeremy. Uh, is it...

1434
01:21:32,346 --> 01:21:34,223
...crazy to think we...

1435
01:21:36,975 --> 01:21:39,945
# That's where you belong

1436
01:21:40,104 --> 01:21:43,074
I know you're not
gonna call me back, but, um...

1437
01:21:44,441 --> 01:21:46,239
One more thing...

1438
01:21:46,402 --> 01:21:49,497
Remember the time
I missed your awards dinner?

1439
01:21:51,281 --> 01:21:53,625
Well, I wasn't really working.

1440
01:21:53,784 --> 01:21:57,163
I was at home watching
Kourtney and Kim Take New York.

1441
01:21:57,329 --> 01:21:59,423
I'm sorry. Um... what else?

1442
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:02,505
# So wherever I go

1443
01:22:02,668 --> 01:22:05,797
# I'm taking you with me

1444
01:22:05,963 --> 01:22:08,887
# Wherever I go

1445
01:22:09,049 --> 01:22:12,303
# You're coming along

1446
01:22:12,469 --> 01:22:15,313
# You're in my hear? #

1447
01:22:15,472 --> 01:22:17,349
- Ah!
- Oh!

1448
01:22:19,768 --> 01:22:20,860
Jeremy and I were talking,

1449
01:22:21,019 --> 01:22:23,442
he has a friend who's also
going through a divorce.

1450
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:26,199
And he works in Poverty at the UN.

1451
01:22:26,817 --> 01:22:28,364
He's really nice and really funny.

1452
01:22:29,027 --> 01:22:31,200
He does pottery at the UN?

1453
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:35,960
I mean, if he's a friend of Jeremy's,
then I guess I could give it a go.

1454
01:22:36,118 --> 01:22:37,586
- Right?
- What's his name?

1455
01:22:38,954 --> 01:22:41,048
[Miranda] Roger... Maybe Roger.

1456
01:22:42,708 --> 01:22:43,550
What?

1457
01:22:43,709 --> 01:22:46,883
Um... That was Cindy.

1458
01:22:47,045 --> 01:22:49,764
She wants to come with me tomorrow
to the OB/GYN.

1459
01:22:49,923 --> 01:22:51,800
[all] Oh!

1460
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:53,469
We're getting Cindy.

1461
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:55,387
- [laughter]
- That's great, Nat.

1462
01:22:55,554 --> 01:22:57,852
Maybe going all "Honest Ned"
on her worked.

1463
01:22:58,515 --> 01:23:00,563
- You don't have to thank me. it's OK.
- Thank you, Ned.

1464
01:23:00,726 --> 01:23:03,400
- [laughter]
- You're gonna be the best uncle.

1465
01:23:03,562 --> 01:23:05,906
- That's sweet.
- Aw, he is the best uncle.

1466
01:23:06,064 --> 01:23:09,534
I can't wait. You better come visit me.

1467
01:23:11,195 --> 01:23:13,744
- Come visit where?
- What do you mean?

1468
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:20,080
I've been wanting to tell you guys.
I think it's time for me to move on.

1469
01:23:22,289 --> 01:23:24,383
- No.
- Move on? Move on where?

1470
01:23:25,876 --> 01:23:27,423
No. I mean...

1471
01:23:27,586 --> 01:23:30,760
You know we just love having you
in our house. Don't you know that?

1472
01:23:30,923 --> 01:23:32,675
Oh, I do know that, and I love you too.

1473
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:36,687
But the city's no place
for Willie Nelson or for me.

1474
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:39,098
I feel like I'm gonna cry.

1475
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:42,108
You guys are gonna be great.
My work here is done.

1476
01:23:42,267 --> 01:23:44,895
Who's gonna watch sci-fi with Jeremy?
I can't always do it.

1477
01:23:45,062 --> 01:23:47,565
- Who's gonna babysit my kid for free?
- Yeah, who?

1478
01:23:47,731 --> 01:23:49,733
- [music plays]
- [laughter]

1479
01:23:57,407 --> 01:23:59,205
[Ned] They're brand new,
I just made them yesterday.

1480
01:23:59,368 --> 01:24:01,871
So you're getting some really
fresh candles. All right.

1481
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:04,631
Have a great Shabbos with those.
Thanks a lot.

1482
01:24:07,709 --> 01:24:10,963
Anyway, what I was saying though,
is people recycle cans,

1483
01:24:11,129 --> 01:24:14,474
they recycle papers, why not candles?

1484
01:24:14,633 --> 01:24:16,977
I say we put a bin out and let people
bring back their old drippings

1485
01:24:17,135 --> 01:24:20,014
- at their convenience.
- it's like those bags that say

1486
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:21,853
"l used to be a plastic bottle."

1487
01:24:22,432 --> 01:24:24,901
We could have a bin that said:
"l used to be another candle."

1488
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:27,779
That's a great idea.
And when they bring in those candles,

1489
01:24:27,938 --> 01:24:30,737
we'll put them in another bin that says:
"l used to be another another candle."

1490
01:24:30,899 --> 01:24:32,867
Yeah, eventually we could
just have one that said:

1491
01:24:33,026 --> 01:24:34,778
"Trust me,
I used to be a lot of candles."

1492
01:24:34,945 --> 01:24:36,117
"I've been a lot of candles."

1493
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:38,248
"Trust me, man,
I've been other candles."

1494
01:24:38,407 --> 01:24:39,579
[laughs]

1495
01:24:39,741 --> 01:24:41,835
Hey, can I get your
honest opinion on something?

1496
01:24:41,994 --> 01:24:43,166
- Sure.
- OK.

1497
01:24:43,787 --> 01:24:45,164
- Be honest with me.
- Of course.

1498
01:24:46,498 --> 01:24:48,171
Do you think this is an ugly candle?

1499
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:51,678
No way, man. There's no such thing
as an ugly homemade candle.

1500
01:24:51,837 --> 01:24:53,180
- Really?
- Yeah.

1501
01:24:53,839 --> 01:24:55,011
- Good.
- You know what?

1502
01:24:55,173 --> 01:24:58,393
We should send, like, just a bunch
of candles to Janet as a thank you.

1503
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:02,557
Totally. To thank her
for introducing us and everything?

1504
01:25:03,265 --> 01:25:04,938
Isn't it funny how life works?

1505
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:08,900
I love it. Just a couple of guys
and a dog, making candles.

1506
01:25:09,646 --> 01:25:11,068
What a clich.

1507
01:25:13,442 --> 01:25:14,785
Hey, Willie.

1508
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:18,367
Willie Nelson.

1509
01:25:21,617 --> 01:25:23,335
Hey, man, have you seen Willie Nelson?

1510
01:25:23,493 --> 01:25:25,370
- Oh, yeah, definitely.
- When?

1511
01:25:25,537 --> 01:25:29,212
Oh, you mean recently? No. I just meant
in general, I have seen him.

1512
01:25:31,918 --> 01:25:33,420
Willie Nelson?

1513
01:25:34,588 --> 01:25:35,714
Willie?

1514
01:25:37,716 --> 01:25:39,263
Willie Nelson!

1515
01:25:41,178 --> 01:25:42,680
Willie?

1516
01:25:44,598 --> 01:25:46,225
Willie Nelson!

1517
01:25:47,434 --> 01:25:49,107
Willie Nelson!

1518
01:25:49,853 --> 01:25:51,571
Willie Nelson!

1519
01:25:52,564 --> 01:25:53,565
[barking]

1520
01:25:53,732 --> 01:25:56,155
Oh, God! Willie Nelson.

1521
01:25:56,318 --> 01:25:58,912
Oh, buddy. Willie.

1522
01:25:59,071 --> 01:26:01,244
Hi, hi.

1523
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:05,369
- Hi, guys. You scared me to death.
- [woman] Dolly?

1524
01:26:05,535 --> 01:26:07,412
- Oh, yeah.
- Dolly?

1525
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:09,457
Deny!

1526
01:26:10,415 --> 01:26:12,588
Hey, come here.

1527
01:26:12,751 --> 01:26:14,298
What are you doing?

1528
01:26:14,461 --> 01:26:17,180
Hi. Where did you go?

1529
01:26:17,339 --> 01:26:20,092
- He ran off, scared me to death.
- So did she.

1530
01:26:20,258 --> 01:26:21,931
- Sorry about that?
- Why do you do that, guys?

1531
01:26:22,094 --> 01:26:25,348
[laughs] I panicked, man. Oh, my God,
I was running all through town

1532
01:26:25,514 --> 01:26:27,562
- yelling, like...
- I was in the woods. [laughs]

1533
01:26:27,724 --> 01:26:30,694
- I had no idea where she had gone.
- She's a cutie, my God.

1534
01:26:30,852 --> 01:26:33,901
Thank you.
Yes, isn't that right, Dolly Parton?

1535
01:26:35,857 --> 01:26:39,111
- Gorgeous girl.
- Your dog's name is Dolly Parton?

1536
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:44,576
Yeah, I know, stupid, but...
I love Dolly Parton, so...

1537
01:26:45,158 --> 01:26:46,410
What's his name?

1538
01:26:47,786 --> 01:26:49,129
Willie Nelson.

1539
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:52,291
Really?

1540
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:54,797
[# Carole King: "Beautiful"]

1548
01:27:26,324 --> 01:27:27,621
- I'm sorry.
- it's so weird.

1549
01:27:27,784 --> 01:27:29,627
It doesn't even look like you.

1550
01:27:30,495 --> 01:27:32,668
- I see no resemblance.
- [laughing]

1551

[squeaking]

1553
01:27:40,797 --> 01:27:43,801
How many times did you criticize him
for having bad breath?

1554
01:27:44,634 --> 01:27:46,102
Or for shedding?

1555
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:49,894
Or for farts? [laughs]

1556
01:27:50,056 --> 01:27:51,603
Shit.

1557
01:27:53,351 --> 01:27:56,480
[laughs] OK, get out.
How does that feel?

1558

Which one... Which one's the door?

You know what?
I'll try them all, never mind.

1560

Oh, that was so much fun, Ned.

[River] Yeah,
why don't you come live with us?

1574

Stuff.

1577
01:29:05,590 --> 01:29:08,218
Probably like Anchorman
or something, right?

1578
01:29:08,385 --> 01:29:10,479
- I haven't seen Anchorman.
- What?!
