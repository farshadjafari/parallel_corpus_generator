1
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,414
We're riding towards Absolution.

2
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,833
You know how far west we are?

3
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,385
Maybe he's a dummy.

4
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,889
Is there a reason you're
not answering my question?

5
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,726
Look here, Pa. He's got
iron on his wrist.

6
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,853
He's been shot.

7
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:51,397
Could be done broke
out of the hoosegow.

8
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,899
Might be worth bounty money.

9
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:54,567
Might could be.

10
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:05,161
It's not your lucky
day, stranger.

11
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:07,830
Turn around and start walking.

12
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:12,251
I said turn around
and start walking!

13
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,049
Get out.

14
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:37,289
Hey! Stay there. Stay!

15
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,842
Hello?

16
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,500
Palms to heaven, friend.

17
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,835
Easy now.

18
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:57,262
All right. Turn around,
nice and slow.

19
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,223
I've been shot.

20
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,315
Only two kinds of men get shot,

21
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,692
criminals and victims.

22
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,028
Which one are you?

23
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:15,781
I don't know.

24
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,783
You got a name, friend?

25
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,953
I don't know that either.

26
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,247
Just what do you know?

27
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,916
English.

28
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,639
Sit down there. Right there.

29
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,026
This your place?

30
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:55,821
Six days a week it is.

31
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:00,409
Seventh belongs to the Almighty.

32
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,460
Where'd you ride in from, son?

33
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,171
West.

34
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,548
West?

35
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:15,841
Mmm-hmm.

36
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:21,138
Well, that's a big
place, the west.

37
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:24,850
Everybody out west
as talkative as you?

38
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:30,522
There we go.

39
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,817
Come on into the
light here, son.

40
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,782
Take a pull of that whiskey,

41
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:43,160
then lay down here and
make yourself comfortable.

42
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:05,057
Well, that is a right
odd-looking wound there.

43
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,103
Looks almost cauterized.

44
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,648
All right, this
might sting a bit.

45
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:17,694
Is this a mining town?

46
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:24,368
Yeah. Well, that was the notion.

47
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:29,456
People moved on, though.
No gold.

48
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,750
All right now, try
and hold still.

49
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,922
There we go.

50
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,300
This is no gunshot.

51
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,345
Where'd you get this, son?

52
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,888
I don't know.

53
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,142
I can't rightly absolve
you of your sins

54
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:49,852
if you don't recall 'em, can I?

55
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:54,148
That being said, I've seen
good men do bad things

56
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:56,608
and bad men do good things.

57
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:00,237
Whether you're gonna end
up in heaven or hell,

58
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:03,031
it's not God's plan,
it's your own.

59
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,493
You just got to
remember what it was.

60
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,329
All right, put me a
finger right here.

61
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:10,664
Come on.

62
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:12,416
There you go.

63
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,172
There.

64
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:20,632
Thank you.

65
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,552
Well, not bad for a
country preacher.

66
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,103
It's that damn fool
Dolarhyde kid.

67
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:36,815
Hey! What are you doing?

68
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,026
What are you doing, Percy?
There's people up there!

69
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,611
No one's up there. It's fine.

70
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,863
It's not fine. It's bad
enough he drinks for free.

71
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,199
Now he has to shoot
up the place?

72
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:46,533
What was that, Doc?

73
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:48,619
Nothing. He didn't say anything.
Everything's okay.

74
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:49,995
Please, please, go back inside.

75
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:51,246
Shut up.

76
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,292
I want to hear what you said.

77
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,294
"It's bad enough" what?

78
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:01,548
You ungrateful for our business?

79
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:04,343
'Cause if it wasn't
for my pa's cattle,

80
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,553
there'd be no money going
through this town!

81
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:09,973
There'd be no meat
on your tables!

82
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:11,975
And your doors would be closed!

83
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,395
I don't mean no disrespect to your
father, Percy. You know that.

84
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,189
Of course not.

85
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,149
But you're asking me to pay.

86
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:24,696
Come here, let's settle up.

87
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:29,034
Come here.

88
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:44,174
Hey, kid, I don't want any trouble.
I'm just trying to..

89
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,097
Better pick up
your glasses, Doc,

90
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,307
before someone steps on them.

91
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,108
Huh?

92
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:02,943
Stop!

93
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,528
I'll pay the goddamn bill!

94
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:08,532
All right, son! He said
he meant no disrespect.

95
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:11,243
We're just trying to make a livin' now.
Come on.

96
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:16,039
You know what, preacher?
You just gave me an idea.

97
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,834
I know it ain't Sunday, folks,

98
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,504
but what say we take up a
collection for the poor man?

99
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,047
Huh?

100
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,259
Now, who's got money?

101
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,179
Come on. In the hat.

102
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,392
Much obliged.

103
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,269
Now, I'm sorry Doc's bad fortune

104
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:40,230
has to be taken out on you good people.
In the hat.

105
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,275
That's mighty Christian of you.

106
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,822
Hey.

107
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,451
You, too.

108
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:56,788
You want to watch where you point
that thing before you get hurt.

109
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:05,922
Listen..

110
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:12,179
I'm gonna give you the benefit
of the doubt, because

111
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:15,515
maybe you don't know who I am.

112
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,906
Come on. Get off of me!

113
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,324
Hey, you!

114
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,119
I'm warning you.

115
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,132
Are you all right?

116
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:54,388
Where the hell did he come from?

117
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,473
What the hell is going on here?

118
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,017
It was an accident.

119
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:00,560
He came out of nowhere.

120
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:04,564
And he dry-gulched me. He tried
to make me look like a fool.

121
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,483
It wasn't my fault, Sheriff.

122
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,692
Damn it, Percy.

123
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:10,278
You crossed the line this time.
I gotta lock you up.

124
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,655
Taggart.

125
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:20,038
You know that's not a good idea.

126
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:23,667
Well, I'm afraid I
got no choice, Nat.

127
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:29,840
Nat?

128
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,176
Nat, you son of a
bitch, where you going?

129
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:35,303
Don't worry.

130
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:38,348
I'll tell your father about
what happened today.

131
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:44,271
You burned the coffee
again, Mickey.

132
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:47,607
Yeah. Tell you what, Ed. Next
time, you can make the coffee.

133
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:48,775
Okay. All right.

134
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,278
Why don't you take it easy on
that Taos Lightnin', Murphy?

135
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:53,530
Mr. Dolarhyde don't like
drinking on the job.

136
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:57,033
Mr. Dolarhyde don't like
drinking on the job?

137
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:03,874
I don't give a rat's ass what the high
and mighty Colonel Dolarhyde don't like!

138
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:08,044
I don't care how many Indians
he put under neither.

139
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:10,881
You sure do flap your gums a lot
when the boss ain't around.

140
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:18,638
I'd say it to his
face if he was here!

141
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,600
Colonel Dolarhyde.

142
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:30,567
I'm gonna tell you
something, boys.

143
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:34,571
Money makes you soft.

144
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:13,109
Where the hell's that coach?

145
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,654
Coach? What coach?

146
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,739
You shot a deputy, Percy.

147
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,825
Federal Marshal's
bringing you to Santa Fe.

148
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,661
Federal Marshal?

149
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:25,121
Sheriff, have you
lost your mind?

150
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,083
My pa is on his way down here.

151
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,253
You better let me out of here
before things get out of hand.

152
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:34,214
Sheriff, it was an accident!

153
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,967
It's not like I'm Jesse James!

154
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:38,718
Son of a bitch.

155
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:39,928
Sheriff!

156
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,223
Hey. More whiskey?

157
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,350
Could you put that
on Percy's tab?

158
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,520
Fifty cents.

159
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:50,855
Just kidding with
you, there, Doc.

160
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:56,611
Hey. Why is there
no soap in here?

161
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,781
Why do you put the dirty
dishes over here?

162
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:01,866
I like 'em over here.

163
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:03,535
I can take over if you..

164
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,162
Why don't you rest?

165
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:07,247
I don't need to rest.

166
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:08,665
I got customers.

167
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,210
I got no respect in this town.

168
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:13,962
That's not true, okay?

169
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:16,590
It's not.. I just didn't want
you to get shot, that's all.

170
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,134
You want to leave?

171
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,971
No. This is your dream.
I'd follow you anywhere.

172
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,347
I thought it was our dream.

173
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,143
God damn it!

174
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,478
Hey, Charlie, why don't you
play something festive?

175
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,064
It's like a funeral in here!

176
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,155
What are you doing
with me, anyway?

177
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,407
Why don't.. Why don't you be with
somebody who can protect you?

178
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,159
I can't even protect myself.

179
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,372
Hey, you don't have to
prove anything, okay?

180
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:51,708
Okay? I love you.

181
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,418
I'm not a child.

182
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,558
Whiskey.

183
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,941
On the house, for what you did.

184
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:38,171
I'm just here to drink.

185
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:44,844
Do I know you?

186
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:45,929
No.

187
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:53,144
My name's Ella.

188
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:58,817
Where'd you get your bracelet?

189
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:04,280
There something you
know about me, lady?

190
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:08,076
You don't remember
anything, do you?

191
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,623
What do you want?

192
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:16,334
I know you're looking
for something.

193
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:17,752
So am I.

194
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:21,715
Well, good luck to you.

195
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:31,766
Move away.

196
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:42,402
Jake Lonergan.

197
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:04,507
You mind following me
over to the office,

198
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:06,468
so we can have us a little chat?

199
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,265
I think you've got
the wrong man.

200
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:17,520
Well, I'm gonna need you to
come with us all the same.

201
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:22,525
Wouldn't do that if I was you.

202
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:52,263
No!

203
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:57,310
I don't want any trouble.

204
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:42,480
Rise and shine.

205
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:48,778
You're in trouble now.

206
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,989
You're gonna burn.

207
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:53,241
My pa is coming for me.

208
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:59,289
He learned how to kill a man
good and slow in the war.

209
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:04,752
I am going to watch you
suffer for a long,

210
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:08,590
long, long time.

211
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:14,429
You thought that cheap
shot in the pecker hurt?

212
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:25,857
Please! I didn't
kill your cattle.

213
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:29,777
Colonel Dolarhyde. You
got to believe me!

214
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:35,867
You only been riding for my
brand for what, two weeks?

215
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:41,247
You don't maybe know who
you're dealing with, Roy.

216
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:47,211
Nobody calls me "Colonel."

217
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,798
Them that did are mostly dead.

218
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,803
Please.

219
00:25:57,723 --> 00:26:00,391
So you, Ed and Little Mickey
is picking up strays.

220
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:01,559
How many did you get?

221
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:04,062
Got 24 of 'em, boss.

222
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:06,731
You been drinking, ain't you?
I can smell it on you.

223
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:09,984
I ain't been drinking. It's
them other two's that drinked.

224
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:14,656
What kind of man goes around
blowing up other people's cows

225
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:19,243
then tells a bullshit story like this?
You couldn't do no better?

226
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:21,829
You got to believe me.
There was white lights!

227
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:23,247
There was bright lights!

228
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:27,335
So there was this big light,
and you fell in the river

229
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:31,589
and when you come back, two of my
best hands has just disappeared.

230
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:38,680
There weren't no storm. There
weren't no lightning this evening.

231
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:40,848
You don't respect
me, do you, Roy?

232
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:42,016
Boss!

233
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:47,313
Where's Percy?

234
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:49,273
Taggart locked him up, boss.

235
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:52,068
Why? What'd he do now?

236
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,986
Shot a deputy.

237
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:55,947
God damn it!

238
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,908
What the hell does Taggart
think he's doing?

239
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:01,035
He wouldn't even
have a job if I..

240
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,122
Now I got to go in there
and reason with him!

241
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:07,208
'Cause you failed to
look after my boy!

242
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:13,881
Thank you. Thank you.

243
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:18,720
All right. Everybody, saddle up.

244
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,519
Boss, we ought to
get more hands.

245
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:27,687
Why?

246
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,355
You're not gonna believe this,

247
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,066
but I think Jake
Lonergan's in town.

248
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,199
What happened to him?

249
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:41,951
I couldn't say.

250
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:00,470
I'm turning you over to
the Federal Marshal.

251
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:04,474
You're gonna tell me
what I am charged with?

252
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:09,896
Arson. Assault.

253
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,148
Mayhem. Hijacking.

254
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,486
It says you robbed
the stage last month

255
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:18,821
with Pat Dolan and Bull McCade.

256
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:22,325
Which makes you accessory to
every law they broke, too.

257
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:29,665
That it?

258
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:32,084
Murder.

259
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:36,506
Prostitute out of Cottonwood
Grove, next county over.

260
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,591
Name of Alice Wills.

261
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:42,762
You saying I killed this woman?

262
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,014
You tell me.

263
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,269
Now, I will treat
you with respect,

264
00:28:51,814 --> 00:28:53,356
but make no mistake,

265
00:28:56,819 --> 00:28:58,444
if you try to escape,

266
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,615
I will put a bullet in you.

267
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,243
Oh, damn.

268
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,248
Give me your wrist.

269
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,917
Taggart, what are you doing?

270
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:57,128
Sheriff.

271
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:00,923
Sheriff, this is going too far.

272
00:30:01,884 --> 00:30:03,259
I was just fooling around.

273
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,305
Look, I didn't mean
to hurt anybody.

274
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:08,931
Go away.

275
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:11,475
Listen, I'm sorry,
but I had no choice.

276
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,019
I couldn't let you leave.

277
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:15,187
Oh. Well, I'm leaving now.

278
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,023
I need you.

279
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:19,233
You got something
to say, say it.

280
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:23,237
I need to know where
you came from.

281
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,573
So do I.

282
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,076
Ma'am.

283
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,084
You two lovebirds
have a nice trip now.

284
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:42,632
Taggart! Taggart,
let me out of here!

285
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,886
Sheriff!

286
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,763
What are you doing?

287
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:52,642
You get back home. Go to bed.

288
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:54,685
Please don't go.

289
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,730
I have to, Emmett. It's my job.

290
00:30:58,023 --> 00:30:59,607
I don't like it here.

291
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:01,901
Your pa's getting
things in order.

292
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,361
When he does he'll send for you.

293
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:05,279
It's been a year.

294
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:07,782
Don't worry, he will.

295
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,702
And your mom's buried here.

296
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:14,288
You know I can't leave
my little girl.

297
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,339
Taggart?

298
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:24,465
Yeah, I see them.

299
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,802
Emmett, you go inside. Now.

300
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,407
I want my boy, John.

301
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:50,658
Pa?

302
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,576
Pa!

303
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,289
I knew you'd come for me, Pa.

304
00:31:57,374 --> 00:31:59,583
Shut up! I'll deal
with you later.

305
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,587
Yeah, that's Lonergan, boss.

306
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:12,096
That's the son of a bitch stole
my gold off the bullion coach.

307
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,597
I want that man.

308
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:16,100
You're gonna have to take it
up with the judge in Santa Fe.

309
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,977
I ain't going to Santa Fe.

310
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:20,021
You give him to me now

311
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:21,856
or I'm gonna take him.

312
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,274
What about me, Pa?

313
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,067
I said, shut up, boy!

314
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:05,399
What the hell is that?

315
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:27,129
What the hell?

316
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,013
They're coming back! They're
coming around again.

317
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:19,765
They're coming back! Dismount!

318
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:37,700
- Get out of the way!
- Maria!

319
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:38,784
Oh, God!

320
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:41,203
Don't move! Don't move!

321
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,039
Stay right there! I'm coming!

322
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:55,885
Give me your hand.

323
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:57,678
Give me your hand.
What the hell for?

324
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,681
I can get us free. Just give me your hand.
Give me, give me your hand.

325
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,433
Hold still.

326
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,279
Emmett!

327
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:18,866
Grandpa!

328
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:22,620
Emmett!

329
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:24,914
It's all right. I got you, son.

330
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:33,964
Give me your hand. No!

331
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,175
Come on. Give me your hand! No!

332
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:52,858
What is that?

333
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:24,056
Come on, get up, boss. Come on,
we got to get out of here.

334
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,599
Where's Percy?

335
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:30,479
Come on out of there!

336
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:34,233
I can't, Pa. You can't? Coward!

337
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:38,112
He broke my fingers!

338
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:46,662
Pa!

339
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,666
Let's go! We got to go!

340
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:53,919
This way!

341
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,287
What is that thing?

342
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:54,123
Why are you asking me?

343
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:56,041
Because you shot it!

344
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,585
With that thing. Where'd
you get that thing?

345
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,838
I don't know.

346
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,550
What do you mean,
you don't know?

347
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:12,141
What the hell is that?

348
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,686
They took my wife.

349
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,233
Hey.

350
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:22,818
Is anyone in there?

351
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,362
No.

352
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:26,905
Is my wife in there?

353
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,323
No!

354
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:30,075
Is it dead?

355
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:41,211
Is it demons?

356
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:42,337
Demons?

357
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:45,424
I can't rightly say. Sure does
fit the description, but..

358
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,551
Demons? What are
you talking about?

359
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,219
You talking about Bible stuff?
Demons?

360
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:50,429
I'm not talking about anything.

361
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:51,597
What the hell are
you talking about?

362
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:52,806
You got to calm down, Doc.

363
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:53,891
Calm down? You're
scaring the boy.

364
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:56,185
You're telling me a bunch
of demons took my wife.

365
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:58,187
I didn't say any such thing.
Took our people!

366
00:39:58,313 --> 00:39:59,855
Get a hold of yourself. You're
telling me to calm down!

367
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:24,671
Boss!

368
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:26,465
Boss!

369
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,133
It went this way.

370
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:34,890
I don't know what it
is, but it's bleeding.

371
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:41,063
That's the same direction those
machines went with our kin.

372
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:44,900
We ain't gonna be able
to track it in the dark.

373
00:40:46,236 --> 00:40:48,028
Round up the horses,
get some supplies!

374
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,030
We set off at first light!

375
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:52,366
You.

376
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:56,078
You're going with us.

377
00:40:56,746 --> 00:40:59,790
I need that weapon. It's the
only thing that counts.

378
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,750
And I figure you owe me.

379
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:05,504
I don't see it that way.

380
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,743
Recall the Book of Numbers,

381
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:41,123
wherein God commanded Moses into
the promised land of Canaan.

382
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:46,795
But Moses was unsure, so he sent his
spies into that land to survey it.

383
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:50,882
And they came back
with terrible stories.

384
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,052
Stories of evil beings,

385
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:56,346
monsters the likes of which
they had never seen before.

386
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,140
"Giants," they said.

387
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:01,685
"And they were as grasshoppers
in their eyes," they said.

388
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:03,979
And the people of
Israel became afraid.

389
00:42:04,147 --> 00:42:06,189
"How can we survive
against them?"

390
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:07,941
They lost their faith.

391
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:12,112
They forgot that there is nothing
to fear under heaven and earth

392
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:15,157
as long as we walk in the
path of righteousness.

393
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:16,450
Hold him still. Hold him still!

394
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:19,911
That He created man by blowing
His breath into the mud,

395
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:24,082
and so there is in each of
us a little breath of God.

396
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:27,002
See if you can stop the bleeding.
Use this.

397
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:29,755
"Thou shalt not be afraid of
the terrors of the night,"

398
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:32,007
"nor the arrow that
flieth by day,"

399
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:34,551
"nor the pestilence that
walketh in darkness."

400
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:38,347
God is testing us, friends.
He's testing our faith.

401
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:40,390
So we're goin' after our kin.

402
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:09,628
What do you want?

403
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:13,131
You come clean right
now, or I'll kill you.

404
00:43:13,216 --> 00:43:17,260
They took my people, too. I've
been looking for them a long time.

405
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:19,721
I know you can
help me find them.

406
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,227
You stay away from me.

407
00:43:35,905 --> 00:43:37,739
I can help you!

408
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:43,787
You know, some of these boys think
they might already all be dead, boss.

409
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,998
If they wanted 'em
dead, they'd be dead.

410
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:50,043
They was ropin' people.
That was a round-up.

411
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,260
Where do you think you're goin'?

412
00:43:58,344 --> 00:43:59,678
I'm comin' with you.

413
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,430
You're dead weight.

414
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:03,265
They took my wife, I'm comin'.

415
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,600
Besides, I'm a doctor.
You need me.

416
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,395
Suit yourself.

417
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,565
You stop right there.

418
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,944
I'm sorry, son, you can't go.
It's too dangerous.

419
00:44:19,949 --> 00:44:21,450
I'll watch him on the ride.

420
00:44:22,452 --> 00:44:23,994
He can water the horses.

421
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,673
He ain't got nobody.

422
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:41,970
All right, then. Make
sure your canteen's full.

423
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:52,314
It's heading north.

424
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:55,567
Its tracks are still fresh.

425
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:10,457
If it's all the same, I'd
like to ride along, too.

426
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:11,917
Yes, ma'am.

427
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:16,254
Got a kid and a dog,
why not a woman?

428
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:04,135
You're back.

429
00:46:20,236 --> 00:46:21,570
What's that?

430
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:40,088
You have to take it back.

431
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:41,923
Like hell I will.

432
00:46:42,425 --> 00:46:43,633
That's blood money.

433
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:44,801
Well, I goddamned earned it.

434
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:46,469
By robbing and killing.

435
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:48,638
That's gonna get
us what we need!

436
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:22,505
Jake! Stay there!

437
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:23,798
Jake!

438
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:56,039
I don't even know why
we're doing this.

439
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:58,124
You know they're all dead.

440
00:47:59,669 --> 00:48:02,879
Well, I think if they wanted to
kill them, I think they would have.

441
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:06,591
Only if the boss is right
and they was roping them.

442
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:09,094
Bet it's to eat them.

443
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:13,181
If it was me, I'd
start with your wife.

444
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:19,062
You gonna be like this the whole trip?
'Cause if you are,

445
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:21,898
we ain't gonna have too many
long conversations, are we?

446
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:24,150
Why don't you sing a
song or something?

447
00:48:24,694 --> 00:48:26,986
Cook some beans. Do
something useful.

448
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:38,873
Take some friendly advice?

449
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:42,877
Get yourself a gun and
learn how to use it.

450
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,055
Well, well, well.

451
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,974
Look who's back.

452
00:48:56,392 --> 00:48:59,185
I see you, but I
don't see my gold.

453
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:01,479
Let's say we find
those people first,

454
00:49:01,564 --> 00:49:04,691
and then you can take your
best shot at collecting.

455
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,901
Maybe that reward on your head

456
00:49:06,986 --> 00:49:09,112
would be a more
attractive proposition.

457
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:13,324
Or I could just shoot you in the chest
and cut that thing off your arm.

458
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:16,911
Can't we just be happy the
guy with the big gun's back?

459
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:20,874
Much obliged to
you, Mr. Lonergan.

460
00:49:22,168 --> 00:49:23,585
Yeah, well,

461
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:25,754
I ain't done nothin' yet.

462
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,881
I appreciate it, all the same.

463
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,727
The tracks are washed away.

464
00:50:10,591 --> 00:50:12,967
I don't know much about boats,

465
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:15,178
but I'd say that
one's upside-down.

466
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:20,558
We're 500 miles from any
river big enough to hold it.

467
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:22,936
Well, let's get inside,
get out of the rain!

468
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,896
I'm not going anywhere
near that thing.

469
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,482
Suit yourself.
Sleep in the rain.

470
00:51:16,365 --> 00:51:17,907
How you gentlemen doin'?

471
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:20,118
All right. How are you? Good.

472
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:21,536
I'm gonna take first watch.

473
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:22,871
Thank you, Deputy.

474
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,667
You want a seat, preacher?

475
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,377
No, no, no. Make
yourself comfortable.

476
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:34,716
You know, Doc, this here
is a Spencer 56-50.

477
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:37,927
You ever shot one of these? No.

478
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:41,014
No time like the present.

479
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:43,057
How's that feel?

480
00:51:43,142 --> 00:51:44,517
It's heavy. It's a
heavy gun, yeah.

481
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:43,076
I swear to God, it's raining
harder in here than it is outside.

482
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:45,244
I'm soaked through.

483
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:47,872
What in the hell are we
sittin' around here for?

484
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,041
We need to be five
miles and a long trot

485
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:52,168
headin' in the opposite
direction of those things.

486
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:56,005
If we tried that, the old
man would shoot us himself.

487
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:57,090
Ain't that right, Wes?

488
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:58,424
Yeah, he would.

489
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:18,569
You fixin' to say something?

490
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:21,239
Maybe..

491
00:53:22,116 --> 00:53:24,534
Maybe we should have
called in the Army?

492
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:27,120
I ain't gonna turn this
over to no West Pointers

493
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:29,497
who got to get on the
telegraph to ask Washington

494
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:31,582
which hand to wipe with.

495
00:53:31,667 --> 00:53:35,336
I waited around at Antietam for
'em to tell me what to do.

496
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:40,049
And lost 328 men

497
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:42,468
over a cornfield.

498
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:46,305
I remember those stories.

499
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:52,145
I don't recollect telling
you any stories.

500
00:53:53,022 --> 00:53:57,025
I'd listen when you'd
tell them to Percy.

501
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:01,529
You get this through
your thick Indian skull.

502
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:06,284
Them stories weren't for you.

503
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:11,039
They were for my son.

504
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:16,252
Get out of here.

505
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:18,379
Go look after the horses.

506
00:54:18,464 --> 00:54:19,630
Do your job.

507
00:54:58,754 --> 00:55:01,589
You've been looking at this knife.
You like this knife?

508
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:17,271
You look after that.

509
00:55:19,608 --> 00:55:20,775
Don't lose it.

510
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:56,144
All right. Just
align your sights,

511
00:55:56,603 --> 00:56:00,148
and when that target peeks up over
the top, just squeeze the trigger.

512
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:06,237
Don't yank on it, it's not your pecker.
Now, here.

513
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:09,240
You're holding onto this thing
like you're hanging from it.

514
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:16,164
What the hell am I doing?

515
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:19,917
It's my fault she got took.

516
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:21,836
I never should have
taken her to that town.

517
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:23,921
No, no, no. Not your fault.

518
00:56:24,006 --> 00:56:26,424
You'll get her back. You're
setting things right.

519
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:28,259
Just got to have faith.
That's all.

520
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:30,136
Faith. Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

521
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,096
God's been real swell to me.

522
00:56:32,181 --> 00:56:33,890
I don't mean no
disrespect, preacher,

523
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:37,518
but either he ain't up there,
or he don't like me very much.

524
00:56:37,603 --> 00:56:39,270
Surely you don't expect the Lord

525
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:41,355
to do everything for
you, do you, Doc?

526
00:56:42,858 --> 00:56:45,276
You got to earn His presence.

527
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,111
Then you got to recognize it,

528
00:56:47,196 --> 00:56:48,988
and then you have to act on it.

529
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,325
Now, keep your eye
on the target.

530
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:55,870
And shoot.

531
00:57:02,044 --> 00:57:05,838
That's better. Better. Come on.
Let's reload.

532
00:57:27,736 --> 00:57:29,570
You been there long?

533
00:57:30,072 --> 00:57:31,405
Yes.

534
00:57:42,251 --> 00:57:43,918
There something you need?

535
00:57:44,753 --> 00:57:46,254
Who is she?

536
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:52,009
She's the only one
who knows who I am.

537
00:57:52,094 --> 00:57:54,262
No, you know who you are.

538
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:56,180
You just have to remember.

539
00:57:56,265 --> 00:57:57,598
Well, I can't.

540
00:57:57,683 --> 00:57:59,350
Yes, you can.

541
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:16,450
Does it hurt?

542
00:58:19,955 --> 00:58:21,706
It's fine.

543
00:58:29,298 --> 00:58:30,464
It's here.

544
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:41,934
Jesus! Goddamn it!

545
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:44,645
Sit down! Ain't nothin'
but a bunch of damn rats.

546
00:58:45,272 --> 00:58:47,773
Damn it! I ain't
getting' paid enough

547
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:51,944
to chase Dolarhyde's idiot son
halfway across the country.

548
00:59:40,452 --> 00:59:42,745
Easy, hey! Easy!

549
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:44,246
What's wrong, boy?

550
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:46,415
Hello?

551
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,754
Get away from that boy!

552
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:20,968
No!

553
01:01:49,289 --> 01:01:50,539
The boy. The boy.

554
01:01:50,624 --> 01:01:52,833
He's fine. He's fine.

555
01:01:53,585 --> 01:01:55,419
It's okay. It's okay.

556
01:01:59,174 --> 01:02:01,842
You got to go get
our people back.

557
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:06,388
God don't care who
you were, son.

558
01:02:07,015 --> 01:02:08,849
Only who you are.

559
01:02:38,547 --> 01:02:39,880
Dog?

560
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:42,258
Come on, boy!

561
01:02:44,636 --> 01:02:45,886
Where are you?

562
01:02:47,222 --> 01:02:48,222
Come on, boy!

563
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:50,599
Tracks are good.
It's headed north.

564
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:52,726
I can't find the dog.

565
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:55,396
We ain't waiting for him.
He's run off or dead.

566
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:56,480
Let's go.

567
01:02:56,690 --> 01:03:00,484
Hey. Hey. Wait. Aren't we gonna
say some words over him?

568
01:03:00,569 --> 01:03:03,654
Only one who knows what
to say is in the ground.

569
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:06,156
Ain't it enough we took the
time to put him there?

570
01:03:06,241 --> 01:03:08,492
No. No, it's not enough.

571
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:22,006
You go ahead.

572
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:25,342
Uh..

573
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:27,678
Lord..

574
01:03:30,682 --> 01:03:34,727
If there is such a thing as a
soul this man had a good one.

575
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:35,936
Please protect it.

576
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:40,774
Made me feel better. World was
a better place for having him.

577
01:03:40,859 --> 01:03:43,569
Dust to dust, amen.
How was that?

578
01:03:43,945 --> 01:03:45,029
Good words.

579
01:03:55,749 --> 01:03:58,208
What are you all
choked up about?

580
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:02,421
I'm worried about my grandpa.

581
01:04:07,427 --> 01:04:11,847
Look. When I was only just a
little bit older than you are now

582
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:14,224
all this was Mexico.

583
01:04:15,894 --> 01:04:21,231
Word come that the Apaches was riding
towards a settlement called Arivaca.

584
01:04:23,234 --> 01:04:24,985
My father wanted me to be a man,

585
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:28,864
so he made me ride out with the
garrison, banging on a drum.

586
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:33,285
Boy, was I scared.

587
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:38,707
Well, we got there, it was too late.
They were all dead

588
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:41,001
and the place was
all burnt down.

589
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:44,296
This one settler fella

590
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:48,300
came crawling out
of a burning cabin.

591
01:04:49,803 --> 01:04:51,303
He was bad.

592
01:04:52,347 --> 01:04:54,473
He knew he was gonna die.

593
01:04:55,475 --> 01:04:57,226
Burnt bad.

594
01:04:59,688 --> 01:05:01,355
He rolled over,

595
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:04,358
looked up into my eyes,

596
01:05:05,652 --> 01:05:07,986
and he said, "Kill me."

597
01:05:10,824 --> 01:05:12,199
What did you do?

598
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:20,207
I took this knife off his belt

599
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:22,918
and I slit his throat.

600
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:26,672
Take it.

601
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:32,052
Be a man.

602
01:05:41,104 --> 01:05:43,439
That's a little rough, isn't it?

603
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:45,858
He means well.

604
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:55,951
Whoa.

605
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:04,126
I got him. The tracks
are closer together.

606
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:06,295
He's slowing down,
headed to that canyon.

607
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:30,486
Put your hands up in the air!

608
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:35,657
That means you,
too, pretty lady.

609
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:39,912
This is what they
call a hold-up.

610
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:43,582
Welcome, everybody. Welcome.

611
01:06:47,587 --> 01:06:48,670
Boss?

612
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:51,924
Boss, is that you?

613
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:55,052
Lonergan?

614
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:58,013
What the hell are
you doing here?

615
01:07:01,768 --> 01:07:04,520
Who are your amigos?

616
01:07:06,773 --> 01:07:09,191
Is this your new gang, Jake?

617
01:07:12,779 --> 01:07:15,364
I never thought I'd
see you again, Jake.

618
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:20,202
You were always my favorite.

619
01:07:21,204 --> 01:07:22,454
Shut up.

620
01:07:24,666 --> 01:07:25,832
Damn it.

621
01:07:25,917 --> 01:07:28,752
Jake? Did you break my tooth?

622
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:31,171
Would you shut up? I'm thinking.

623
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:36,843
How many boys we got left?

624
01:07:38,263 --> 01:07:39,721
About the same.

625
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:42,599
Which is?

626
01:07:43,977 --> 01:07:45,185
Thirty?

627
01:07:45,853 --> 01:07:48,188
That's right. Thirty.

628
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:49,815
Good.

629
01:07:51,859 --> 01:07:53,610
That's good. Yeah.

630
01:07:54,862 --> 01:07:56,822
You're gonna bring
me to the camp.

631
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,076
It's time to set
things straight.

632
01:08:03,538 --> 01:08:05,831
We're gonna go to the camp!

633
01:08:09,877 --> 01:08:11,336
Lonergan's back.

634
01:08:27,979 --> 01:08:29,688
Lay off that whiskey!

635
01:08:30,815 --> 01:08:33,900
Coach is on its way, and we
best damn be sober for it.

636
01:08:36,738 --> 01:08:37,738
Red?

637
01:08:38,323 --> 01:08:39,823
How's the haul?

638
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:43,952
Vulture Mine gold.
Looking pretty rich.

639
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:45,829
How much dynamite we get?

640
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:47,497
We got 50 sticks or so.

641
01:08:47,582 --> 01:08:49,291
Dolan!

642
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:54,921
It's about time you got back.

643
01:08:55,006 --> 01:08:56,590
What the hell happened to you?

644
01:08:57,175 --> 01:08:58,508
He did.

645
01:09:06,017 --> 01:09:07,768
Well, shit.

646
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:13,565
You got some balls

647
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:16,693
riding back in here like
nothing ever happened.

648
01:09:17,862 --> 01:09:21,948
Boys! Grab your guns.
We're riding out.

649
01:09:22,450 --> 01:09:24,451
Boys aren't going
anywhere with you, Jake.

650
01:09:26,371 --> 01:09:29,122
We're fixing to rob us a coach.

651
01:09:29,207 --> 01:09:31,917
And that's exactly
what we're gonna do.

652
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:40,634
Are you her?

653
01:09:41,386 --> 01:09:42,844
Am I who?

654
01:09:42,929 --> 01:09:45,681
The whore that Jake
quit this gang for.

655
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:48,100
You watch your mouth.

656
01:09:48,393 --> 01:09:49,559
Or what?

657
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:53,271
I run this outfit now.

658
01:09:53,356 --> 01:09:54,815
Put your guns on the whore!

659
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:56,525
If he so much as twitches,

660
01:09:56,734 --> 01:09:58,902
blow her brains out of her ear.

661
01:10:02,281 --> 01:10:04,282
He said the whore.

662
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:07,327
You call her a whore again,

663
01:10:07,412 --> 01:10:09,621
it'll be the last
word you ever say.

664
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:13,041
You ain't in no position
to make threats, boyo.

665
01:10:13,126 --> 01:10:14,960
Hunt, take his gun.

666
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:17,462
Take his gun!

667
01:10:19,132 --> 01:10:20,799
Sorry, Jake.

668
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:42,404
Where's our gold, Jake?

669
01:10:43,656 --> 01:10:45,323
I don't remember.

670
01:10:53,332 --> 01:10:55,250
Well, I do remember

671
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:57,752
you telling us you was
leaving us high and dry

672
01:10:57,837 --> 01:10:59,671
because of some woman.

673
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:12,350
I guess you just
left out the part

674
01:11:12,435 --> 01:11:15,937
about taking all our gold
from that last job, huh?

675
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:19,941
So I'm gonna ask
you one last time.

676
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:22,986
Where is it, Jake?

677
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:26,615
Demons.

678
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:30,827
What's that?

679
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:33,371
Demons took your gold.

680
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:36,541
When you get to hell

681
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:39,794
you can ask for it back.

682
01:11:48,888 --> 01:11:50,555
Kill the whore.

683
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:06,738
I told you not to call her that.

684
01:12:06,822 --> 01:12:08,698
Everybody!

685
01:12:08,783 --> 01:12:10,116
Drop 'em!

686
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:12,661
I said drop 'em!

687
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:21,753
Not fun, is it?

688
01:12:22,255 --> 01:12:24,923
You know, that wasn't very nice.

689
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:30,345
On your horses!

690
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:32,097
Go!

691
01:12:33,224 --> 01:12:36,393
Jake, Jake, Jake. Don't
forget your gun.

692
01:12:36,477 --> 01:12:37,769
You'll always be my favorite.

693
01:12:47,488 --> 01:12:49,614
Mount up! Ride!

694
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:16,933
Whoa!

695
01:13:18,728 --> 01:13:19,728
They're here!

696
01:13:19,812 --> 01:13:20,895
Move out!

697
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:41,666
Come on!

698
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:54,114
Okay. I got you!

699
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:55,323
I got you!

700
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:12,590
Can you swim?

701
01:15:17,847 --> 01:15:19,097
Oh, God.

702
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:20,348
Turn your head!

703
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,624
You all right?

704
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:53,131
Let's get in.

705
01:16:12,735 --> 01:16:14,402
We were flying.

706
01:16:15,696 --> 01:16:17,280
Yeah!

707
01:16:17,656 --> 01:16:19,491
I don't want to do that again.

708
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:20,742
No.

709
01:17:33,357 --> 01:17:34,607
Hey.

710
01:17:35,401 --> 01:17:37,318
Hey, you stay with me.

711
01:17:38,571 --> 01:17:40,071
Keep talking.

712
01:17:41,532 --> 01:17:43,825
You remember now, don't you?

713
01:17:45,244 --> 01:17:46,411
What?

714
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:48,413
The woman.

715
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:51,916
Did you love her?

716
01:17:53,419 --> 01:17:55,336
You can tell me.

717
01:17:55,421 --> 01:17:57,463
I can't remember.

718
01:17:58,090 --> 01:17:59,591
I must've.

719
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:02,844
All I know is I owe it to her

720
01:18:03,971 --> 01:18:05,471
to find her.

721
01:18:07,808 --> 01:18:10,393
Watch out. I'm sorry.

722
01:18:10,477 --> 01:18:11,811
I'm sorry.

723
01:18:13,314 --> 01:18:17,150
I got you.

724
01:18:21,488 --> 01:18:23,156
It's not far now.

725
01:18:25,242 --> 01:18:26,576
You and me,

726
01:18:27,995 --> 01:18:29,829
we're gonna be just fine.

727
01:18:39,048 --> 01:18:40,548
Is that them?

728
01:18:41,342 --> 01:18:42,508
Boss?

729
01:18:52,227 --> 01:18:53,227
I got her.

730
01:18:53,312 --> 01:18:55,605
Give her to me, Nat.
Bring her here.

731
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:00,610
Here. Drink.

732
01:19:00,694 --> 01:19:03,571
No. Give it to her.
Give it to her.

733
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:15,917
Doc?

734
01:19:26,887 --> 01:19:28,429
How is she?

735
01:19:30,891 --> 01:19:32,684
She's gone, pal.

736
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:37,355
No. No, she's not gone.

737
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:39,607
She's not. She's not gone!

738
01:19:40,567 --> 01:19:41,901
Jake.

739
01:19:43,112 --> 01:19:44,862
She's gone.

740
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:21,274
Doc! Don't touch him!

741
01:20:21,692 --> 01:20:22,984
Doc!

742
01:20:58,645 --> 01:21:00,188
This is Black Knife.

743
01:21:02,232 --> 01:21:03,441
The last of his people.

744
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:04,817
There's no reasoning with them.

745
01:21:04,902 --> 01:21:06,444
We're all gonna die anyway.

746
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:08,362
This is what's left
of the Chiricahuas.

747
01:21:08,447 --> 01:21:09,614
Good riddance to 'em!

748
01:21:10,824 --> 01:21:12,909
He's saying the white people,

749
01:21:12,993 --> 01:21:14,786
they brought all this
evil to his people.

750
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:18,539
We brought evil? Evil was here!
You're the evil one!

751
01:21:18,665 --> 01:21:21,042
He's saying we brought
the monsters.

752
01:21:21,168 --> 01:21:23,961
We didn't bring the monsters. Tell
him they took our people, too!

753
01:21:24,046 --> 01:21:25,505
Tell him they took my wife!

754
01:21:25,589 --> 01:21:28,049
Shut up! There's no
reasoning with them!

755
01:21:28,675 --> 01:21:30,218
Tell him what I said, Nat!

756
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:31,719
Kill us now!

757
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:40,204
I'm sorry, but I
couldn't tell you.

758
01:22:40,289 --> 01:22:41,831
Are you one of them?

759
01:22:41,915 --> 01:22:45,418
No. I'm from a different place.

760
01:22:45,502 --> 01:22:48,629
I took this form so I
could walk among you.

761
01:22:49,923 --> 01:22:51,465
You should have told me.

762
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:54,177
I didn't know if I
could heal this body,

763
01:22:54,261 --> 01:22:56,012
if I would wake up.

764
01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:10,359
He wants to know
where you're from.

765
01:23:20,162 --> 01:23:21,245
What'd she say?

766
01:23:21,330 --> 01:23:24,707
She says she came from a
place above the stars.

767
01:23:25,167 --> 01:23:27,460
What does that mean? Another world?
What do you mean?

768
01:23:27,544 --> 01:23:29,545
What does that mean? What?

769
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:31,631
He says you shouldn't talk.

770
01:23:31,715 --> 01:23:33,257
What do you mean I shouldn't talk?
I got questions..

771
01:23:34,509 --> 01:23:35,760
You're a guest of the chief.

772
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:38,638
Now I'm a guest? I thought
I was a prisoner!

773
01:23:38,722 --> 01:23:41,432
Enough! All right. You're both big men!
Great warriors!

774
01:23:41,516 --> 01:23:44,018
Can we listen to the
woman tell her story?

775
01:23:44,102 --> 01:23:45,853
Or whatever she is? What
are they doing here?

776
01:23:46,188 --> 01:23:47,772
They want gold.

777
01:23:50,150 --> 01:23:51,651
Well, that's just ridiculous.

778
01:23:51,735 --> 01:23:53,903
What are they gonna
do, buy something?

779
01:23:53,987 --> 01:23:56,697
It's as rare to them
as it is to you.

780
01:23:56,782 --> 01:23:57,907
What about my grandpa?

781
01:23:57,991 --> 01:23:59,992
What about my wife? What
about the other people?

782
01:24:00,077 --> 01:24:02,286
Are they still alive?

783
01:24:02,371 --> 01:24:04,372
If they are, they
won't be for long.

784
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:08,793
They're studying
your weaknesses.

785
01:24:08,877 --> 01:24:10,836
These are just scouts.

786
01:24:10,921 --> 01:24:12,880
If we let them leave,
they'll come back with more

787
01:24:12,965 --> 01:24:16,050
and there will be no survivors.

788
01:24:16,134 --> 01:24:18,302
That's what they
did to my people.

789
01:24:18,387 --> 01:24:21,013
I came here to make sure
it would not happen again,

790
01:24:21,098 --> 01:24:23,683
but we have to work together.

791
01:24:29,773 --> 01:24:32,066
He says his people
will join her.

792
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:35,695
Join her? What's she going to do?
Where you going to go?

793
01:24:35,779 --> 01:24:37,697
We can find them. He
knows where they are.

794
01:24:42,119 --> 01:24:43,244
No, I don't.

795
01:24:44,913 --> 01:24:46,330
I can't remember anything.

796
01:24:46,415 --> 01:24:47,790
I couldn't even
remember my own name.

797
01:24:51,586 --> 01:24:54,338
He says they will
take care of that.

798
01:27:19,276 --> 01:27:21,110
I brought the gold.

799
01:27:22,362 --> 01:27:23,737
Into the house.

800
01:27:25,449 --> 01:27:27,741
That's why she died.

801
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:30,744
It's not your fault.

802
01:28:40,398 --> 01:28:42,316
I know where they are.

803
01:29:28,697 --> 01:29:30,864
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

804
01:29:32,742 --> 01:29:34,868
How did they build
something like that?

805
01:29:34,953 --> 01:29:37,788
They arrived in it.
It's their vessel.

806
01:29:38,248 --> 01:29:39,999
That's only the top. The
rest is underground.

807
01:29:40,083 --> 01:29:41,917
It's how they mine for gold.

808
01:29:42,002 --> 01:29:43,669
So there is gold here.

809
01:29:44,754 --> 01:29:46,338
Can they see out of there?

810
01:29:46,756 --> 01:29:48,382
They don't see well in daylight.

811
01:29:48,466 --> 01:29:51,302
They stay underground in
caverns where it's dark.

812
01:30:21,875 --> 01:30:23,542
We'll never even get close.

813
01:30:23,627 --> 01:30:27,046
Those flying machines will just pick
us off before we get anywhere near it.

814
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:29,048
There is another way in.

815
01:30:29,799 --> 01:30:31,300
Down there.

816
01:30:32,052 --> 01:30:33,510
The way I came out.

817
01:30:35,388 --> 01:30:37,181
We got to get those
creatures out of there

818
01:30:37,265 --> 01:30:40,643
and out in the open, where
we can get at them.

819
01:30:40,727 --> 01:30:43,937
So you can go in with that
arm gun, get our people out.

820
01:30:45,815 --> 01:30:48,984
We have one advantage,
they underestimate you.

821
01:30:49,069 --> 01:30:50,986
You're like insects to them.

822
01:30:51,071 --> 01:30:53,906
They're not planning on defending
themselves, so they'll be vulnerable.

823
01:30:55,158 --> 01:30:56,325
We haven't got enough men.

824
01:30:56,785 --> 01:30:58,786
This ain't gonna work.

825
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:06,293
He says he wants to
use your spyglass.

826
01:31:32,779 --> 01:31:35,698
The Apaches are
mountain warriors.

827
01:31:35,782 --> 01:31:39,618
He says it's better to
fight from high ground.

828
01:31:40,787 --> 01:31:42,204
Tell him he's a fool.

829
01:31:42,288 --> 01:31:45,290
There is no high ground while
they got those flying machines.

830
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:47,084
Jake's leaving!

831
01:31:54,759 --> 01:31:56,218
That's just dandy.

832
01:31:56,302 --> 01:31:58,470
The son of a bitch.

833
01:32:00,682 --> 01:32:02,891
Quit stalling. How
much gold we had left?

834
01:32:06,771 --> 01:32:09,356
It's about $1,000. Maybe more.

835
01:32:09,983 --> 01:32:12,776
Well, I'm just gonna need to
know how much gold is mine,

836
01:32:13,153 --> 01:32:14,903
so I can best be on my way.

837
01:32:16,072 --> 01:32:17,406
On your way?

838
01:32:18,533 --> 01:32:19,825
Dolan's dead.

839
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:21,827
I run this gang now.

840
01:32:24,164 --> 01:32:25,664
Now, you might be in charge,

841
01:32:26,249 --> 01:32:28,500
but some of that
gold's mine, fair.

842
01:32:29,085 --> 01:32:30,753
After what we saw yesterday,

843
01:32:31,004 --> 01:32:32,755
I'm gonna need every
little bit of it I can

844
01:32:32,839 --> 01:32:34,923
to get as far away
from here as I can.

845
01:32:37,010 --> 01:32:38,886
The gold goes where I go.

846
01:32:40,263 --> 01:32:41,805
What's fair is fair.

847
01:32:46,686 --> 01:32:47,644
Red?

848
01:32:47,729 --> 01:32:48,854
I got 'em, Bull.

849
01:32:50,064 --> 01:32:51,648
You ain't goin' anywhere.

850
01:33:01,659 --> 01:33:03,243
Hey, there, dog.

851
01:33:05,205 --> 01:33:08,040
I had one hell of a
job finding you boys.

852
01:33:10,126 --> 01:33:11,585
You planning a trip?

853
01:33:14,881 --> 01:33:16,882
We're going as far
away as we can go.

854
01:33:16,966 --> 01:33:18,926
You remember la playa
in Puerto Vallarta?

855
01:33:19,010 --> 01:33:20,427
They got good fishing.

856
01:33:21,346 --> 01:33:23,931
Good tequila. You
want to come with us?

857
01:33:24,015 --> 01:33:26,225
Don't make no difference.

858
01:33:27,393 --> 01:33:28,894
It's not far enough.

859
01:33:31,231 --> 01:33:33,398
What the hell were
those things, Jake?

860
01:33:33,858 --> 01:33:35,317
It doesn't matter.

861
01:33:35,401 --> 01:33:39,404
They're gonna find us and
they're gonna wipe us out.

862
01:33:40,406 --> 01:33:42,407
What in the hell are you saying?

863
01:33:43,409 --> 01:33:46,036
What I'm saying is
you got a choice.

864
01:33:46,788 --> 01:33:49,665
You can drink your last few
hours away on a beach,

865
01:33:49,749 --> 01:33:52,918
which by the way,
is not a bad idea

866
01:33:54,379 --> 01:33:57,214
or you can follow
me one last time.

867
01:33:59,467 --> 01:34:01,093
Why the hell would we do that?

868
01:34:02,136 --> 01:34:04,638
Same reason you
always have, Bull.

869
01:34:10,395 --> 01:34:11,603
I'll make you rich.

870
01:34:14,482 --> 01:34:17,651
We got to make the best
use of our resources.

871
01:34:17,735 --> 01:34:21,113
We got to have a strict..
Listen to me, damn it!

872
01:34:21,656 --> 01:34:24,950
He doesn't understand tactics.
You got to explain to him.

873
01:34:25,034 --> 01:34:28,370
Look, we can't just
run around hollering

874
01:34:28,454 --> 01:34:31,790
and throwing spears and shooting
arrows at the damn thing.

875
01:34:31,875 --> 01:34:36,003
We got to draw them out
of there onto open ground

876
01:34:36,087 --> 01:34:39,506
where we can surround them,
attack them on all sides.

877
01:34:39,591 --> 01:34:41,758
Flank them. Explain to him.

878
01:34:45,346 --> 01:34:48,682
He said he's not going to
let you lead his people.

879
01:34:58,776 --> 01:35:00,527
What's he saying?

880
01:35:02,155 --> 01:35:07,618
He's saying they need to open their
hearts and see in you what he has seen.

881
01:35:11,873 --> 01:35:14,708
That his parents died
in the Mexican War

882
01:35:15,376 --> 01:35:18,170
and you took him in
when he was only a boy.

883
01:35:20,924 --> 01:35:23,050
That you gave him purpose.

884
01:35:23,801 --> 01:35:26,511
Taught him how to
take care of himself

885
01:35:26,596 --> 01:35:28,430
even though you were not blood.

886
01:35:33,394 --> 01:35:37,731
That you despise battle but
would never run from it.

887
01:35:40,151 --> 01:35:43,904
That you're a fierce warrior
worthy of any fight.

888
01:36:03,091 --> 01:36:04,466
He says if you're
such a great warrior,

889
01:36:04,550 --> 01:36:07,511
why do you only have a man and a
boy to follow you into battle?

890
01:36:42,922 --> 01:36:45,757
Dog! Dog!

891
01:36:47,593 --> 01:36:48,885
Boy!

892
01:36:48,970 --> 01:36:50,303
How are you?

893
01:37:00,314 --> 01:37:01,481
Woodrow.

894
01:37:17,457 --> 01:37:19,750
Hot damn.

895
01:37:51,991 --> 01:37:53,617
Emmett.

896
01:37:54,911 --> 01:37:57,662
You shouldn't be here. Let's go.

897
01:39:24,709 --> 01:39:28,545
Do you have a woman?
A lady, a wife?

898
01:39:30,590 --> 01:39:33,383
No. I'm always working.

899
01:39:34,260 --> 01:39:35,260
I see.

900
01:39:36,846 --> 01:39:38,889
You work.. You work hard?

901
01:39:40,266 --> 01:39:41,266
Yeah.

902
01:39:44,103 --> 01:39:45,937
Lot of killing? Huh?

903
01:39:46,022 --> 01:39:47,188
Killing?

904
01:39:47,732 --> 01:39:49,858
A little bit. Sí, sí.

905
01:39:49,942 --> 01:39:50,942
Yeah.

906
01:39:51,110 --> 01:39:54,154
My wife, you know, she's a Mexicano.
Mexicana.

907
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:12,172
You should know.. I'm not
gonna be here very long.

908
01:40:15,843 --> 01:40:17,761
None of us are here very long.

909
01:40:30,483 --> 01:40:32,692
Don't ever do that to me again.

910
01:42:43,699 --> 01:42:45,784
Give me that. Okay.

911
01:42:54,043 --> 01:42:55,543
Matches.

912
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:09,474
I don't have any more matches.
We're gonna have to go down.

913
01:43:09,558 --> 01:43:10,975
I don't know what
we're going to do.

914
01:43:18,567 --> 01:43:20,652
Go. Go!

915
01:43:34,125 --> 01:43:35,333
Go. Go!

916
01:44:15,332 --> 01:44:17,083
I think we destroyed it.

917
01:44:29,388 --> 01:44:31,389
Demons are coming out.

918
01:44:35,227 --> 01:44:37,353
Take this. Go up
where I showed you.

919
01:44:37,479 --> 01:44:39,230
You see our people, wave your arms.
Yes, sir.

920
01:44:39,315 --> 01:44:41,232
Move out!

921
01:44:54,580 --> 01:44:55,997
Good job.

922
01:44:56,081 --> 01:44:59,417
If your people are in
there, I'll get them out.

923
01:44:59,501 --> 01:45:00,585
Godspeed.

924
01:45:02,213 --> 01:45:03,546
Let's get them!

925
01:46:16,662 --> 01:46:19,330
This is how they
get the gold out.

926
01:46:42,271 --> 01:46:43,396
Doc!

927
01:46:44,523 --> 01:46:45,523
Doc!

928
01:46:46,692 --> 01:46:48,192
What do we got?

929
01:46:48,736 --> 01:46:50,695
I'm hurt.

930
01:46:50,863 --> 01:46:52,113
You'll be all right.

931
01:46:52,489 --> 01:46:53,489
How bad is it, Doc?

932
01:46:53,574 --> 01:46:55,283
Just a flesh wound.
You'll be all right.

933
01:46:55,367 --> 01:46:58,286
Compadre, you'll be all right.
Maybe not point the gun at me.

934
01:46:58,370 --> 01:47:01,372
Put some weight and see how it feels.
Get on out there.

935
01:47:09,882 --> 01:47:11,299
They're not going down!

936
01:47:11,383 --> 01:47:14,886
They will! Keep at it till
we get our people out!

937
01:48:16,490 --> 01:48:17,657
Doc!

938
01:48:18,325 --> 01:48:19,992
Doc, get down here!

939
01:48:23,163 --> 01:48:24,330
Jesus.

940
01:48:27,167 --> 01:48:28,334
Doc!

941
01:48:29,586 --> 01:48:31,170
Did we get one?

942
01:48:32,881 --> 01:48:34,590
Yeah, we got one.

943
01:48:36,385 --> 01:48:41,180
I always dreamed of riding
into battle with you.

944
01:48:44,184 --> 01:48:47,228
I always dreamed of
having a son like you.

945
01:48:50,816 --> 01:48:51,899
Go.

946
01:48:52,651 --> 01:48:53,985
Get Percy.

947
01:48:54,862 --> 01:48:56,362
Get your son.

948
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:26,786
Don't look into the light.

949
01:51:02,948 --> 01:51:04,323
I told you not to
look into the light.

950
01:51:04,408 --> 01:51:05,616
Yeah, right.

951
01:51:25,304 --> 01:51:27,096
How long are they
gonna be like this?

952
01:51:27,180 --> 01:51:29,015
Each one's different.

953
01:51:34,021 --> 01:51:35,021
Hold them off.

954
01:51:35,105 --> 01:51:37,023
You'd better hurry.

955
01:52:17,898 --> 01:52:19,940
There's more of them coming!

956
01:52:54,893 --> 01:52:56,227
Go!

957
01:53:20,711 --> 01:53:22,253
Everybody's out.

958
01:53:22,879 --> 01:53:24,255
Right.

959
01:53:25,590 --> 01:53:28,092
Hey! Where are you going?

960
01:53:28,635 --> 01:53:30,928
It's this way!

961
01:54:20,479 --> 01:54:21,604
Go. Go!

962
01:55:57,117 --> 01:55:59,243
What the hell are you doing?
We have to get out of here!

963
01:55:59,327 --> 01:56:00,578
No!

964
01:56:01,121 --> 01:56:03,205
I came here to
destroy that thing.

965
01:56:03,290 --> 01:56:04,290
How?

966
01:56:04,374 --> 01:56:06,500
With the bracelet. Take it off.

967
01:56:06,793 --> 01:56:08,544
Wait, I can't take it off.

968
01:56:08,628 --> 01:56:10,296
Yes, you can. You
can control it.

969
01:56:10,380 --> 01:56:13,007
How? Same way you shoot it.
With your mind.

970
01:56:14,509 --> 01:56:16,719
You have to stop thinking.

971
01:56:27,772 --> 01:56:29,106
This isn't working.

972
01:56:44,831 --> 01:56:46,332
It fell off.

973
01:56:55,842 --> 01:56:59,011
If I can get it to its
core, I can stop them.

974
01:57:01,640 --> 01:57:03,682
Let's go.

975
01:57:14,694 --> 01:57:16,028
Take this.

976
01:57:42,222 --> 01:57:43,430
Throw it!

977
01:57:48,603 --> 01:57:50,646
Good-bye, Jake. What?

978
01:57:52,065 --> 01:57:54,274
Wait! Ella!

979
01:57:56,027 --> 01:57:57,277
No!

980
01:58:57,464 --> 01:58:59,465
I see them! I see them!

981
01:58:59,549 --> 01:59:01,508
They got out. They're
coming out the other side!

982
01:59:01,593 --> 01:59:02,801
You see Percy?

983
01:59:06,931 --> 01:59:07,931
Yeah, I see him!

984
01:59:08,016 --> 01:59:09,558
What about Jake and Ella?

985
01:59:10,101 --> 01:59:12,227
No. They're not there.

986
02:02:11,407 --> 02:02:13,033
You all right, old man?

987
02:02:22,627 --> 02:02:25,587
Where's the girl?
She's still inside.

988
02:02:31,678 --> 02:02:32,844
Go, go!

989
02:04:56,989 --> 02:04:58,073
Grandpa!

990
02:04:59,075 --> 02:05:00,409
It's me.

991
02:05:02,370 --> 02:05:04,955
Emmett.

992
02:05:11,003 --> 02:05:12,838
You're all grown up.

993
02:05:20,513 --> 02:05:22,055
Percy.

994
02:05:26,811 --> 02:05:29,062
Don't you remember me, boy?

995
02:05:29,981 --> 02:05:34,192
I'm sorry. I don't
remember much.

996
02:05:35,027 --> 02:05:36,695
I'm your father.

997
02:05:38,072 --> 02:05:39,656
Oh, Pa.

998
02:05:50,543 --> 02:05:52,544
Do you remember me?

999
02:06:06,017 --> 02:06:09,436
I thought you were dead.
I thought you were dead.

1000
02:07:45,783 --> 02:07:47,200
Hey, bartender!

1001
02:07:47,618 --> 02:07:50,996
How many more songs we gotta listen
to before we get another drink?

1002
02:07:51,122 --> 02:07:53,039
Hey, simmer down there, cowboy!

1003
02:07:53,291 --> 02:07:54,791
I'm just glad to see my wife.

1004
02:07:58,462 --> 02:08:00,922
One more shot of
whiskey right here.

1005
02:08:01,048 --> 02:08:02,632
Oh, yeah? What do you got there?

1006
02:08:02,717 --> 02:08:03,717
Demon gold.

1007
02:08:04,010 --> 02:08:05,427
This ain't Wells Fargo.

1008
02:08:06,137 --> 02:08:07,387
I need some coin.

1009
02:08:07,471 --> 02:08:08,513
Hey, Doc.

1010
02:08:08,597 --> 02:08:09,806
Yeah!

1011
02:08:09,890 --> 02:08:12,642
Doc, a drink for me
and my friend here.

1012
02:08:13,144 --> 02:08:14,311
Ain't he a little young?

1013
02:08:14,937 --> 02:08:16,813
What, after what he's
been through, Doc?

1014
02:08:17,106 --> 02:08:19,190
Two sarsaparillas, please!

1015
02:08:22,320 --> 02:08:24,321
And this

1016
02:08:25,698 --> 02:08:28,408
should take care of
any outstanding debt.

1017
02:08:28,993 --> 02:08:32,704
Well, thank you, Percy. Thank you kindly.
Appreciate it.

1018
02:08:42,298 --> 02:08:43,340
Percy.

1019
02:08:44,592 --> 02:08:45,633
Yes, comin', Pa.

1020
02:08:45,760 --> 02:08:46,760
Doc?

1021
02:08:47,219 --> 02:08:49,012
Next round's on the Dolarhydes.

1022
02:08:57,313 --> 02:09:00,398
All this gold's gonna
make things different.

1023
02:09:00,775 --> 02:09:04,527
We're gonna have a rail
road in here soon.

1024
02:09:04,612 --> 02:09:07,280
That'll change the
cattle business.

1025
02:09:09,450 --> 02:09:12,702
Run these ledgers back to
the bank for me, will you?

1026
02:09:12,787 --> 02:09:15,205
Tell them I need
some new checks.

1027
02:09:16,082 --> 02:09:17,207
Okay.

1028
02:09:19,168 --> 02:09:23,296
I want the new ones to
read "Dolarhyde and Son."

1029
02:09:26,300 --> 02:09:27,467
That sound good to you?

1030
02:09:27,551 --> 02:09:30,470
Yes. Yes, sir.

1031
02:09:42,316 --> 02:09:43,400
John.

1032
02:09:44,151 --> 02:09:45,193
Woodrow.

1033
02:09:46,612 --> 02:09:50,198
It appears our town is about
to get a whole lot bigger.

1034
02:09:55,329 --> 02:09:57,997
You weren't gonna leave without
saying good-bye, were you?

1035
02:10:01,752 --> 02:10:03,545
I'm a wanted man.

1036
02:10:04,463 --> 02:10:08,383
I could have sworn I saw Jake
Lonergan die in those caves,

1037
02:10:08,467 --> 02:10:09,634
didn't you, Sheriff?

1038
02:10:09,718 --> 02:10:13,721
Damn shame. I was looking
forward to hanging him myself.

1039
02:10:15,683 --> 02:10:17,434
I could use a good
man around here.

1040
02:10:17,518 --> 02:10:19,352
Yes, you could.

1041
02:10:24,733 --> 02:10:26,025
Jake.

1042
02:10:28,320 --> 02:10:30,363
She's in a better place.

1043
02:10:34,160 --> 02:10:35,702
I'll see you around, Colonel.

1044
02:10:59,500 --> 02:11:04,000
