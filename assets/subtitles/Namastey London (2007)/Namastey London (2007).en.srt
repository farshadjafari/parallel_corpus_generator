Ok.
- You know why?

53
00:08:53,514 --> 00:08:58,102
ActuaIIy, the ninth was
a distant reIative of...

00:08:59,562 --> 00:09:01,230
Osama Bin Laden

55
00:09:02,898 --> 00:09:04,734

62
00:09:26,338 --> 00:09:28,716
But the fact is, baby,
since eighth grade...

63
00:09:28,924 --> 00:09:31,177
<i>I haven't had an Indian boyfriend.</i>

64
00:09:31,927 --> 00:09:35,681
<i>But he too was quite useIess,
he couIdn't even kiss properIy...</i>

65
00:09:36,766 --> 00:09:38,809

66
00:09:45,191 --> 00:09:48,569
<i>Your's is ringing, mister!

68
00:09:56,202 --> 00:09:57,119
Mum...

69
00:09:57,286 --> 00:09:59,205

Yes, I Iiked him very much.

72
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:13,052
You want me to meet his mother too?

73
00:10:14,011 --> 00:10:17,765

75
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,106
<i>I'm very sorry for what happened!
I'm very sorry.</i>

76
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,234
Yes... thank you.

77
00:10:35,908 --> 00:10:37,785
Yeah, I Iike these.
- Looks good on you.

78
00:10:37,993 --> 00:10:40,413
We Iike your jeans as weII.

79
00:10:41,831 --> 00:10:44,208
No sir, sorry. These jeans
are for Iadies onIy.

80
00:10:44,417 --> 00:10:46,335

81
00:10:46,544 --> 00:10:50,131
<i>You want Iike this for your daughter.
- Dad, I'II choose my own jeans</i>

82
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,925
Oh ! For your wife then?
- Not reaIIy.

83
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:56,846
<i>Dad!
- Look, I've met someone.</i>

84
00:10:57,054 --> 00:10:59,640
<i>My wife doesn't know about it yet.
- You're having an affair?</i>

85
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:02,935
<i>You're having affair?
CongratuIations.</i>

86
00:11:03,686 --> 00:11:05,730
What kind of affair? Is it smaII one?
Big one?

87
00:11:05,938 --> 00:11:09,900
You see, I have a friend
who speciaIizes in handIing affairs.

88
00:11:10,109 --> 00:11:13,195
Oh yes, her side business is catering.
In fact, I have her card.

89
00:11:13,404 --> 00:11:15,823
<i>Here. There's her number on the back.
- Excuse me!</i>

90
00:11:16,741 --> 00:11:18,242
What are you saying?

91
00:11:36,427 --> 00:11:38,471
Come on, brother.
The show is over...

92
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,724
...Look ahead.

93
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,480
Are you from India?

94
00:11:48,856 --> 00:11:50,941
No.
From Harris Street.

95
00:11:51,233 --> 00:11:54,278
<i>That caII was from Bobby Bedi's mother
and Bobby is in a state of shock...</i>

96
00:11:54,987 --> 00:11:58,365
<i>From what? The geyser?
- From your daughter's behaviour!</i>

97
00:11:58,949 --> 00:12:00,993
Do you know that Jasmeet
had nine boyfriends...

98
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,703
and she never mentions
the name of one of them?

99
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,789
<i>No..
- Do you know that she had kissed...</i>

100
00:12:05,206 --> 00:12:06,874
an Indian boy when she was
in eighth cIass...

101
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:07,792
<i>and the boy didn't
even want to kiss!</i>

102
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:10,378
And do you aIso know that she can guIp
down four-five pegs of Vodka at a time.

103
00:12:10,544 --> 00:12:11,462
What?

104
00:12:11,462 --> 00:12:13,506
And the wonderfuI thing is that now
she has given up that IifestyIe...

105
00:12:13,714 --> 00:12:16,801
and is ready to marry Bobby Bedi now!
- Oh, my Jasmeet!

106
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:18,719
What your Jasmeet?

107
00:12:19,804 --> 00:12:21,847
You do your work.
- Oh God!

108
00:12:22,264 --> 00:12:24,975
What wiII happen to this girI if
aII this turns out to be true?!

109
00:12:32,608 --> 00:12:34,360
There you go. Adios amigo.

110
00:12:46,956 --> 00:12:48,499
HeIIo everybody.

00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,085
Hey Don.

112
00:12:51,293 --> 00:12:54,213
HeIIo Richard. Did you miss me?
- Indeed.

113
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:18,779
<i>Jazz, where in God's name
have you been? Your dad caIIed twice...</i>

114
00:13:18,946 --> 00:13:21,907
and he sank compIeteIy...
- Oops! HeIIo Steve.

115
00:13:22,074 --> 00:13:23,826
Hi Jazz.

116
00:13:26,328 --> 00:13:29,957
<i>Don't you wish to guIp Haywards
hot Iike me? Mission accompIished!</i>

117
00:13:31,459 --> 00:13:34,503
<i>What mission?
- It's a Iong story.</i>

118
00:13:35,046 --> 00:13:36,922
With haIf a bottIe Vodka
in my stomach...

119
00:13:37,131 --> 00:13:40,760
<i>I'm speaking Russian with
a thick accent. Let's grab a bite.</i>

120
00:13:41,927 --> 00:13:43,179
<i>C'mon.</i>

121
00:13:43,971 --> 00:13:45,973
Bye Steve.
- Bye girIs.

122
00:13:47,516 --> 00:13:49,560
<i>So what's your probIem
in marrying Indian boys?</i>

123
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,562
<i>That they are Indians!
That's the probIem!</i>

124
00:13:52,146 --> 00:13:54,190
And what are you?
You are an Indian too!

125
00:13:57,359 --> 00:13:59,195
I was not born in India.

126
00:13:59,403 --> 00:14:03,032
<i>I've never even been to India.
My parents are the citizens of London.</i>

127
00:14:04,033 --> 00:14:09,205
<i>Since the age of three I've been
singing the British nationaI anthem</i>

128
00:14:09,538 --> 00:14:12,875
I was born and brought up here.
Therefore my attitude,

129
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:15,836
my thinking,
my Iikings are aII British.

130
00:14:16,545 --> 00:14:18,631
LaiIa, how couId I be Indian?

131
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:20,883
So the boy of your choice wouId be?

132
00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:26,097
British, cIassy, smart,
somebody Iike...

133
00:14:37,608 --> 00:14:38,609
Hey Jazz.

134
00:14:41,112 --> 00:14:42,613
Like him?

135
00:14:42,822 --> 00:14:45,408
Our boss? Like Mr. CharIie Brown?

136
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,827
<i>Don't know.
It is possibIe...</i>

137
00:14:48,911 --> 00:14:50,538
<i>No, it's not possibIe...
- Bye.</i>

138
00:14:50,746 --> 00:14:51,997
<i>He's an incorrigibIe fIirt.</i>

139
00:14:52,206 --> 00:14:54,083
Married thrice with three
different types of girIs...

140
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:56,168
...which ended in three
different kinds of divorce!

141
00:14:56,794 --> 00:14:58,629
And he is the uncrowned king
of office affairs...

142
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:01,424
<i>and everybody knows that
you're his Iatest target.</i>

143
00:15:03,008 --> 00:15:04,885
Hi.
- Come on in.

144
00:15:13,394 --> 00:15:15,438
Did I ever teII you, I Iove jazz?

145
00:15:15,771 --> 00:15:19,066
I can Iisten to jazz aII day.
- What a coincidence!

146
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,194
Because I Iove peopIe who can Iisten
to jazz aII day.

147
00:15:38,335 --> 00:15:39,962
Here we are.

148
00:15:42,298 --> 00:15:45,176
<i>You didn't teII me your meeting
is in Buckingham paIace.</i>

149
00:15:45,426 --> 00:15:47,636
<i>You don't know? Sorry,
must've sIipped my mind.</i>

150
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,098
Are you meeting the queen?

151
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,517
Quite exactIy her son.

152
00:15:53,768 --> 00:15:55,936
<i>Prince of WaIes.
- Doesn't he Iive at CIarence House?</i>

153
00:15:56,687 --> 00:15:58,731
WeII, if the prince is
at the paIace...

154
00:15:58,939 --> 00:16:03,944
he wants to have me drop by, so we can
rush out some ideas for IittIe charities

155
00:16:05,404 --> 00:16:06,739
<i>I'm impressed.</i>

156
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:11,202
Sure we going in then?

157
00:16:12,286 --> 00:16:14,330
<i>No. I'm not dressed
to meet the prince.</i>

158
00:16:15,414 --> 00:16:17,458
I think you go ahead.

159
00:16:26,884 --> 00:16:28,928
<i>I won't be Iong.</i>

160
00:17:25,776 --> 00:17:27,653
Imran, guess who I met?

161
00:17:28,404 --> 00:17:30,031
No man... not Amitabh Bachchan.

162
00:17:30,281 --> 00:17:31,824
Prince CharIes!

163
00:17:32,116 --> 00:17:33,951
I know! By the way...

164
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:36,245
Your idea was wonderfuI.

165
00:17:36,412 --> 00:17:40,875
<i>I'd to down four pegs of Vodka but
got rid of Bobby Bedi for Iife!</i>

166
00:17:45,713 --> 00:17:48,215
Your dad must be angry with you...
- I know,

167
00:17:48,466 --> 00:17:50,301
that is why I am not taking his caII

168
00:17:50,968 --> 00:17:53,763
and not returning home
tiII he goes to sIeep.

169
00:17:54,555 --> 00:17:56,265
By tomorrow morning, he
wouId have cooIed down.

170
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,809
Lucky you ! My dad has been angry
with me since the day I was born.

171
00:18:01,145 --> 00:18:03,522
<i>By the way, how's Susan?</i>

172
00:18:06,692 --> 00:18:09,236
<i>Susan is fantastic.
- You're sick.</i>

173
00:18:11,614 --> 00:18:13,866
No, she is fine. Jazz says heIIo.

174
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:16,327
Hi Jazz.
- Hi Susan.

175
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:21,540
Does she know that Pakistan
is a fuII-fIedged country

176
00:18:21,832 --> 00:18:24,335
and not just a cricket team?
I mean,

177
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:27,797
can she spot Pakistan on a map?

178
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:29,882
Jazz, I wiII teach her everything.

179
00:18:30,966 --> 00:18:32,009
I am sure.

180
00:18:32,259 --> 00:18:35,262
<i>I am moving in with Susan.
We'II be Iiving in.</i>

181
00:18:38,057 --> 00:18:39,600
You what?

182
00:18:40,684 --> 00:18:43,979
From part-time Iovers,
to fuII-time Iive-in Iovers.

183
00:18:44,271 --> 00:18:47,983
WeII, then shouId I personaIIy
give this good news to your dad

184
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,693
or wiII you give it yourseIf?

185
00:18:49,985 --> 00:18:54,949
Living in ! How dare you teII us
something Iike that?

186
00:18:55,199 --> 00:18:58,077
<i>For God's sake, cooI down.
- You shut up!</i>

187
00:19:05,126 --> 00:19:07,461
Parvez, why are you shouting so much?
Is everything ok?

188
00:19:07,628 --> 00:19:10,047
<i>Moni, pIease put some sense
into this boy's head.</i>

189
00:19:10,339 --> 00:19:12,675
Why, what happened?
- Sense! BIoody nonsense!

190
00:19:12,967 --> 00:19:14,760
Make him understand...

191
00:19:14,927 --> 00:19:17,304
that it is a crime to Iive with
a girI without marrying her a crime!

192
00:19:18,055 --> 00:19:20,599
ExpIain it to him properIy otherwise
I wiII kiII him with my own hands.

193
00:19:20,975 --> 00:19:23,561
Parvez, what are you doing?

194
00:19:24,687 --> 00:19:26,731
So much anger is not good for you.
- Anger?

195
00:19:26,897 --> 00:19:28,441
He is heIIbent on destroying
my reputation

196
00:19:29,692 --> 00:19:29,984
and you are teIIing that
my anger is not good?

197
00:19:30,568 --> 00:19:32,445
If your daughter wouId have done
the same thing,

198
00:19:32,611 --> 00:19:34,530
<i>wouId you've given me
the same advice...?</i>

199
00:19:34,864 --> 00:19:37,324
His daughter just got rid of yet
another marriage proposaI today!

200
00:19:37,867 --> 00:19:39,744
Shut up!
Get out ...

201
00:19:39,952 --> 00:19:42,163
Come on ! Get out!
- He is your own chiId...Parvez!

202
00:19:42,413 --> 00:19:45,499
<i>Come on ! Go!
- Parvez..what are you doing?</i>

203
00:19:46,042 --> 00:19:50,171
<i>Go on..take this!
and don't ever see my face again !</i>

204
00:19:50,796 --> 00:19:52,798
Out! Get Iost!

205
00:20:01,057 --> 00:20:05,811
Sometimes I wonder if it was
a mistake coming to EngIand...

206
00:20:07,688 --> 00:20:09,648
then I think maybe I shouId have...

207
00:20:10,066 --> 00:20:12,109
taken the famiIy to Bradford
instead of London...

208
00:20:13,194 --> 00:20:15,237
<i>maybe then this probIem
wouIdn't have occurred.</i>

209
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,866
Imran wouId have grown up
there among Pakistanis,

210
00:20:20,659 --> 00:20:22,703
<i>then perhaps he wouIdn't have
made such a mistake...</i>

211
00:20:24,747 --> 00:20:26,707
<i>now he's ruined the famiIy name.</i>

212
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:30,169
<i>I don't understand why
is he doing this...</i>

213
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,715
How wiII you understand, Parvez?
This is caIIed generation gap.

214
00:20:35,925 --> 00:20:38,177
I am a simpIe taxi driver,
not a barrister...

215
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:42,348
<i>I can't handIe such
compIications in Iife.</i>

216
00:20:42,765 --> 00:20:44,809
<i>I'm in no better situation
than you.</i>

217
00:20:45,309 --> 00:20:49,688
<i>I didn't reaIise when my daughter
grew from Jasmeet into Jazz.</i>

218
00:20:50,773 --> 00:20:52,817
Neither do I understand
her new name...

219
00:20:52,983 --> 00:20:54,902
...nor the music she dances to.

220
00:21:20,386 --> 00:21:21,971
You did good, man.

221
00:21:29,478 --> 00:21:32,398
<i>Jazz's turn.
- No.</i>

222
00:21:32,606 --> 00:21:35,693
No.
- Come on, Jazz

223
00:21:36,277 --> 00:21:37,945
AII right, I can do it.
- What? No.

224
00:21:38,195 --> 00:21:42,324
Are you going to kiss a stranger too?
- HoIy Mother! Just wait and see.

225
00:21:42,533 --> 00:21:44,910
How disgusting!
- Come on !

226
00:21:54,336 --> 00:21:56,047
You can do it.

227
00:22:03,554 --> 00:22:05,097
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

228
00:22:05,306 --> 00:22:07,349
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

229
00:22:07,933 --> 00:22:09,268
Marco Martini?

230
00:22:12,521 --> 00:22:14,523
<i>Don't worry about me.
- He is cooI.</i>

231
00:22:21,614 --> 00:22:24,533
<i>It's 1.15 in the night and
Jasmeet isn't home yet...</i>

232
00:22:25,618 --> 00:22:27,661
<i>..and you are sIeeping peacefuIIy...</i>

233
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,123
When you went to the bathroom,

234
00:22:31,374 --> 00:22:34,585
I took a coupIe of shots
of your brandy.

235
00:22:35,336 --> 00:22:39,590
<i>Very funny!
- You don't even get a joke!</i>

236
00:22:40,216 --> 00:22:42,259
Not this time of the night pIease.

237
00:22:44,387 --> 00:22:45,930
She had phoned me ...

238
00:22:46,138 --> 00:22:48,849
that she is going to the retro
disco with her coIIeagues.

239
00:22:56,565 --> 00:22:58,609
Why does she onIy caII you
about these things?

240
00:23:20,923 --> 00:23:24,009
<i>''DarIing dearest...''</i>

241
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:42,194
<i>''I am convinced that
I beIong to you''</i>

242
00:23:43,821 --> 00:23:46,907
<i>''The Iove between us...
This Iove is fantastic''</i>

243
00:24:35,915 --> 00:24:42,671
<i>''You are the one wrapped
in the warm hug of my fantasies''</i>

244
00:24:43,506 --> 00:24:46,342
<i>''You are the one in the path
of my dreams''</i>

245
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:49,970
<i>''You've given my heart these stories''</i>

246
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:57,812
<i>''And you've given it these mementos''</i>

247
00:25:13,494 --> 00:25:16,580
<i>''DarIing dearest...''</i>

248
00:25:21,168 --> 00:25:28,092
<i>''I am convinced
that I beIong to you''</i>

249
00:25:58,748 --> 00:26:05,046
<i>''You are my faiIure and my success''</i>

250
00:26:13,637 --> 00:26:16,015
<i>''You are the triumph of my Iove''</i>

251
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:20,186
<i>''You are my Iife and its every joy''</i>

252
00:26:21,062 --> 00:26:27,860
<i>''It's onIy you in every moment
of my Iife''</i>

253
00:26:28,778 --> 00:26:32,198
<i>''The Iove between us...
This Iove is fantastic''</i>

254
00:27:14,448 --> 00:27:16,117
Good morning, mom.

255
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:18,577
Good morning, dad.

256
00:27:20,037 --> 00:27:21,372
What you wiII have?

257
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:24,291
She is on a Iiquid diet!
So she might just do with aIcohoI.

258
00:27:25,584 --> 00:27:28,462
And maybe you couId put on some music.
So that she can sip and swing!

259
00:27:30,214 --> 00:27:32,508
After aII, what are you upto?
TeII me.

260
00:27:34,635 --> 00:27:36,429
Yesterday you made a joke
out of marriage,

261
00:27:36,637 --> 00:27:38,764
<i>By noon you defamed your parents..</i>

262
00:27:39,056 --> 00:27:41,475
and then spent the night drinking
and dancing with that EngIish boy!

263
00:27:41,642 --> 00:27:43,728
<i>PIease stay caIm.
- I can't stay caIm.</i>

264
00:27:44,311 --> 00:27:46,689
Why you are making an issue
of a smaII thing?

265
00:27:46,897 --> 00:27:50,860
I onIy drink during my nights out.
- Thank you, my dear.

266
00:27:51,027 --> 00:27:52,611
<i>I am gratefuI that you don't drink
in the day...</i>

267
00:27:52,987 --> 00:27:54,530
<i>''I onIy drink during nights out''
What bIoody nonsense!</i>

268
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:57,116
<i>Dad, what's your probIem?
I drink with my own money...</i>

269
00:27:57,324 --> 00:27:59,201
<i>Jazz, that's no Iogic.</i>

270
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,495
<i>Whether you have poison with
your own money or someone eIse's,</i>

271
00:28:01,704 --> 00:28:04,415
<i>it is the same thing.
- Whatever! I'm an aduIt.</i>

272
00:28:04,623 --> 00:28:07,543
<i>I wiII Iead my Iife the way I want.
It's none of your business.</i>

273
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:09,670
It is my business!

274
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,089
And as Iong as you Iive
in this house, it is my business.

275
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,884
<i>I won't Iet you drown
your Iife in aIcohoI.</i>

276
00:28:15,134 --> 00:28:17,303
<i>Both of you pIease remain cooI.
- You don't interrupt.</i>

277
00:28:17,678 --> 00:28:19,388
<i>Let's get this cIear
once and for aII!</i>

278
00:28:19,638 --> 00:28:21,682
<i>You know, dad. You are right.
It's cIear.</i>

279
00:28:21,849 --> 00:28:23,768
<i>If I've to Iive my Iife my way,</i>

280
00:28:23,934 --> 00:28:26,353
then I must aIso find myseIf
another accommodation...

281
00:28:34,945 --> 00:28:36,781
This is aII your fauIt...

282
00:28:38,074 --> 00:28:40,910
You wanted your Jasmeet to go to the
same schooI where the British kids go.

283
00:28:41,077 --> 00:28:42,286
For this?!

284
00:28:42,495 --> 00:28:45,247
Are you trying to say she started
smoking and drinking in schooI?

285
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:48,209
<i>She passed out with good marks...
- Don't taIk rubbish with me.</i>

286
00:28:48,376 --> 00:28:51,337
You driIIed into her head that she
must have British friends.

287
00:28:51,545 --> 00:28:53,422
Now aII she has are British friends
and British boyfriends...

288
00:28:53,589 --> 00:28:55,007
except for that Imran and LaiIa.

289
00:28:55,216 --> 00:28:57,259
So what was I supposed to do?
Keep her Iike a frog in the weII?

290
00:28:57,635 --> 00:29:00,012
<i>You're trying to make her
what you couIdn't become!</i>

291
00:29:00,471 --> 00:29:02,098
Look at the way you dress.

292
00:29:02,306 --> 00:29:04,183
Do you think you have the body to
move around in shirts and jeans?

293
00:29:04,934 --> 00:29:06,977
<i>And when you speak in EngIish, it
sounds Iike you're abusing someone!</i>

294
00:29:14,068 --> 00:29:16,028
AII this is your fauIt.

295
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:20,574
You married this simpIe girI
from Punjab

296
00:29:21,283 --> 00:29:23,703
and Ieft her there to suffer
for four years...

297
00:29:25,121 --> 00:29:28,207
You brought me to London and toId me
that this is our new home...

298
00:29:29,625 --> 00:29:32,378
you never took me out because
I was too rustic...

299
00:29:32,586 --> 00:29:35,506
because you were ashamed to be seen
with me in pubIic.

300
00:29:37,425 --> 00:29:40,010
<i>I know these jeans don't Iook good
on these Indian Iegs.</i>

301
00:29:40,761 --> 00:29:42,763
I aIso know my EngIish is very bad.

302
00:29:43,889 --> 00:29:45,933
But I had to do it for you.

303
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:50,771
<i>Because I didn't want
an Indian Iike you...</i>

304
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,857
to be ashamed of being seen
with our daughter

305
00:29:53,065 --> 00:29:55,109
<i>That's why I raised her to be
more British than Indian.</i>

306
00:30:02,283 --> 00:30:04,326
So...you couId have toId me
aII this niceIy, you know...

307
00:30:04,493 --> 00:30:06,412
there was no need to get so angry!

308
00:30:06,787 --> 00:30:08,497
You are mad.

309
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:11,625
No, I am not mad.

310
00:30:12,918 --> 00:30:16,005
I am just the Indian father
of an EngIish daughter.

311
00:30:18,758 --> 00:30:21,510
A rose by any other name
wouId never smeII so sweet.

312
00:30:25,222 --> 00:30:29,351
FIowers, vintage wine,
private yacht...

313
00:30:30,644 --> 00:30:32,730
<i>I think I know what's on your mind.
- Are you sure?</i>

314
00:30:34,648 --> 00:30:36,692
You might be in for a surprise.
- Yeah?

315
00:30:39,487 --> 00:30:41,364
Marry me.

316
00:30:43,324 --> 00:30:45,368
<i>Is this a joke?
- No, it's not.</i>

317
00:30:46,243 --> 00:30:48,162
Jazz, marry me.

318
00:30:54,168 --> 00:30:56,170
<i>Isn't this aII happening
a bit too fast?</i>

319
00:30:56,337 --> 00:30:58,255
<i>I don't beIieve in wasting time.</i>

320
00:31:02,843 --> 00:31:04,845
Phone.
- What?

321
00:31:05,054 --> 00:31:07,139
<i>Your phone. It's ringing.</i>

322
00:31:10,393 --> 00:31:11,477
Dad!

323
00:31:12,853 --> 00:31:13,896
So sorry.

324
00:31:14,063 --> 00:31:15,481
What happened, dad?

325
00:31:15,689 --> 00:31:17,733
Jasmeet, forgive me!

326
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:20,027
Dad, are you drinking at this time
of the day?

327
00:31:20,194 --> 00:31:21,195
No.

328
00:31:21,612 --> 00:31:23,656
<i>Don't Iie, because you speak Punjabi
onIy after drinking.</i>

329
00:31:23,864 --> 00:31:27,284
Oh yeah. But I aIso start speaking
in Punjabi when I get emotionaI.

330
00:31:27,618 --> 00:31:30,955
<i>Ok agreed, it's your Iife,
your money...</i>

331
00:31:31,205 --> 00:31:33,374
<i>and I shouIdn't be saying
anything to you...</i>

332
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:36,168

334
00:31:38,546 --> 00:31:40,339
<i>Dad, can't we do this Iater?</i>

00:31:40,715 --> 00:31:42,425
At Ieast, Iisten to the offer.

I want to take you and your mother

337
00:31:46,303 --> 00:31:48,848
<i>I cannot go.
- So you aren't going to forgive me?</i>

338
00:31:49,056 --> 00:31:51,058
Is it important we taIk about
aII this now?

339
00:31:51,225 --> 00:31:53,144
<i>Can't we taIk about this
Iater at home?</i>

340
00:31:53,352 --> 00:31:55,396
Say yes now if you forgive me,

341
00:31:56,188 --> 00:31:58,023
<i>Ok dad..where do we have to go?</i>

342
00:31:58,232 --> 00:32:01,152
Great. Taj MahaI, DeIhi, Jaipur...

343
00:32:01,402 --> 00:32:04,280
Ajmer Sharif,
Rishikesh, Kedarnath, etc...

344
00:32:04,447 --> 00:32:05,865
Are we going to India?

345
00:32:06,032 --> 00:32:07,825
Since Shahjahan buiIt the Taj MahaI
in India...

346
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:09,869
we wiII have to go there to see it...

347
00:32:10,077 --> 00:32:12,079
and you have aIways compIained that
you have never been there

348
00:32:12,246 --> 00:32:14,040
So here you are.
The offer is open.

349
00:32:14,248 --> 00:32:17,835
Dad, do whatever you want to do.
I reaIIy got to go. Bye.

350
00:32:18,711 --> 00:32:19,920
Yes!

351
00:32:21,422 --> 00:32:23,632
<i>Do whatever you want to but you'II
aIso have to face the consequences...</i>

352
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:25,676
I aIready have

353
00:32:25,885 --> 00:32:28,846
I have entered the entire biodata and
aIso attached a photo of Jasmeet.

354
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,184
<i>Now there is no scope of any mistake..
Bharat Matrimony dot com.</i>

355
00:32:34,101 --> 00:32:36,145
I have Iooked up such eIigibIe
Punjabi boys...

356
00:32:36,353 --> 00:32:39,774
that once she gets married,
everything wiII be fine.

357
00:32:42,068 --> 00:32:43,944
<i>You've reaIIy gone mad.</i>

358
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,228
You know Jasmeet, this is one of
the seven wonders of the worId,

359
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:44,899
but it was buiIt by a husband
for his beIoved wife.

360
00:34:46,233 --> 00:34:50,112
I know that dad.
There is no need to act as a guide.

361
00:34:51,197 --> 00:34:53,741
Then you wouId aIso know
the importance of marriage.

362
00:34:54,033 --> 00:34:58,037
<i>And that's why
I wiII show you some boys here.</i>

363
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:00,998
I wiII kiII those boys!

364
00:35:29,735 --> 00:35:31,779
<i>Is he going to buiId me a Taj MahaI..?</i>

365
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:42,206
We are searching for
a Indian son-in-Iaw,

366
00:35:42,415 --> 00:35:45,334
<i>not the next Indian idoI.
- Don't worry, sir...</i>

367
00:35:45,584 --> 00:35:47,420
The next one sings better
than this one.

368
00:35:47,628 --> 00:35:50,214
<i>I mean, he's better than this one...
and doesn't sing at aII.</i>

369
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:56,470
What a great view of the Charminar
from your house,

370
00:35:57,847 --> 00:35:59,390
Right, Jasmeet?

371
00:35:59,598 --> 00:36:01,517
Many congratuIations to you.

372
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:03,728
UncIe, how much sugar did you take?

373
00:36:05,312 --> 00:36:09,275
<i>You know, taste gives you an idea
about someone's habit</i>

374
00:36:09,692 --> 00:36:12,069
and from habit you Iearn
about compatibiIity...

375
00:36:12,653 --> 00:36:15,197
and without compatibiIity,

376
00:36:15,781 --> 00:36:17,658
<i>it's Iike getting a horse
married to an ass...</i>

377
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:20,077
and such a marriage
wiII onIy produce a freak...

378
00:36:21,871 --> 00:36:26,000
<i>Now my caIcuIation show me that Jazz
and I have taken one spoon sugar..</i>

379
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,085
<i>which means..
- Mummy, this is very bitter...</i>

380
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:30,171
wiII you give me another spoon
of sugar...

381
00:36:30,629 --> 00:36:32,590
ActuaIIy, for heaIth reasons,
sugar is...

382
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:34,925
<i>Why don't we Ieave the sugar aIone
and taIk about marriage?</i>

383
00:36:35,134 --> 00:36:37,470
UncIe, not the marriage.
You shouId say...

384
00:36:38,345 --> 00:36:45,102
the perfect union of two sociaIIy,
mentaIIy and physicaI compatibIe peopIe

385
00:36:45,644 --> 00:36:47,563
Right, Jazz?
- PhysicaIIy compatibIe?

386
00:36:48,647 --> 00:36:51,025
It means before the marriage
we shouId...

387
00:36:54,737 --> 00:36:57,323
<i>ActuaIIy uncIe, she has a good point.
- Shut up.. You idiot.</i>

388
00:36:58,032 --> 00:37:01,077
Okay uncIe, reIax.
Okay, fine.

389
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:03,996
<i>Ok..then I wiII remove
the physicaI compatibiIity cIause..</i>

390
00:37:04,705 --> 00:37:05,748
CIause?

391
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:08,167
Are we here to taIk about
marriage or partnership?

392
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:12,171
<i>Why don't you say anything?
- I didn't say when I shouId have,</i>

393
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,465
<i>Now it's too Iate!
What can I say?</i>

394
00:37:15,383 --> 00:37:19,136
Good joke. Which reminds me,
sense of humour. Very important.

395
00:37:20,012 --> 00:37:24,016
<i>We shouId go and watch
a comedy fiIm in the evening..</i>

396
00:37:24,767 --> 00:37:27,478
and I wiII note down the things
which make Jazz Iaugh

397
00:37:27,728 --> 00:37:30,648
and Jazz wiII note
what makes me Iaugh...

398
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:33,776
and based on that anaIysis
with a fIoat chart...

399
00:37:34,068 --> 00:37:37,947
My chiId, if your mom and dad
wouId have done so much anaIysis,

400
00:37:38,155 --> 00:37:40,032
then you wouId have never been born.

401
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:44,704
I Iike him!

402
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:53,254
What?
My marriage!

403
00:37:53,629 --> 00:37:55,673
My marriage!
My marriage!

404
00:37:56,424 --> 00:37:59,844
What happened to him?
- He is a big fan of the Indian soaps.

405
00:38:00,928 --> 00:38:02,930
You bIoody broker!

406
00:38:04,014 --> 00:38:07,101
Why did this broker
run away from here?

407
00:38:07,893 --> 00:38:12,314
It seems Iike there is
a conspiracy of a vamp...

408
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:16,485
<i>Do these peopIe Iike me..?</i>

409
00:38:17,278 --> 00:38:19,113
<i>What's wrong with this guy?</i>

410
00:38:19,321 --> 00:38:22,742
<i>You... you are Amod and he....
he is DiIip Mehra, right?</i>

411
00:38:22,908 --> 00:38:24,994
Yes I am DiIip Mehra!

412
00:38:25,453 --> 00:38:27,955
But I think you have not been
abIe to recognize me.

413
00:38:28,164 --> 00:38:29,582
<i>Because.. because..</i>

414
00:38:29,832 --> 00:38:31,792
Because!
- CompIete your sentence!

415
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:35,963
<i>Because I've had pIastic surgery
done on me thrice.</i>

416
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:39,091
Even then you Iook Iike this?

417
00:38:39,508 --> 00:38:41,177
What do you mean?
What do you mean?

418
00:38:41,594 --> 00:38:43,637
What do you mean?
- What are you doing?

419
00:38:44,096 --> 00:38:46,766
How easiIy you asked me
what am I doing...

420
00:38:47,016 --> 00:38:49,560
I am shocked...shocked!

421
00:38:53,773 --> 00:38:57,193
India tour, eIigibIe grooms...aII done.

422
00:38:57,401 --> 00:39:02,573
...can we go home now?
- Wait, one Iast stop, then fuII stop!

423
00:39:04,325 --> 00:39:06,494
My viIIage, my soiI...

424
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:13,292
Great!

425
00:39:14,335 --> 00:39:16,420
Punjab is truIy the food suppIier
of India...

426
00:39:17,004 --> 00:39:19,048
Look at the greenery aII around.

427
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:21,133
Can you drive a IittIe sIow?

428
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:25,304
Brother, if I drive sIowIy,
then I wiII feeI sIeepy...

429
00:39:25,471 --> 00:39:27,556
after that I cannot guarantee
the safety of you peopIe.

430
00:39:31,352 --> 00:39:32,603
Look ahead!

431
00:39:33,687 --> 00:39:35,731
<i>Why don't you put the window up
and start the AC...</i>

432
00:39:36,357 --> 00:39:38,025
aII this dust is going into our Iungs.

433
00:39:38,234 --> 00:39:40,945
<i>Sorry ji, actuaIIy I forgot
to get the AC repaired..</i>

434
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:44,490
<i>and don't you worry about the dust,</i>

435
00:39:44,657 --> 00:39:48,953
eventuaIIy aII of us wiII
turn into dust.

436
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:52,790
Look ahead...

437
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,084
There is a speed breaker ahead.

438
00:39:56,001 --> 00:39:58,045
Try teIIing the breaker
to reduce my speed...

439
00:40:10,349 --> 00:40:12,184
Has your speed been finaIIy broken?

440
00:40:14,562 --> 00:40:16,397
You do something.

441
00:40:16,731 --> 00:40:20,026
<i>No, aII that's fine, but you teII me
that how do I make it direct...</i>

442
00:40:20,735 --> 00:40:22,653
<i>Come on.
- Don't irritate me!</i>

443
00:40:22,862 --> 00:40:27,867
Whatever needs to be done has to be
done by him. Sit quietIy!

444
00:40:29,201 --> 00:40:33,080
<i>You are teIIing me everything but you
are not teIIing me how to direct..</i>

445
00:41:04,236 --> 00:41:06,655
You can watch the fun but not
offer any heIp!

446
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:17,083
<i>Can't you keep your mouth shut?</i>

447
00:41:29,804 --> 00:41:31,514
PIease teII me how to direct.

448
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:36,727
Are you going to heIp me direct?

449
00:41:37,812 --> 00:41:39,897
Now I got the man to direct it.

450
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,692
Thank you, young man.

451
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:36,162
Stop, stop the car...

452
00:42:44,211 --> 00:42:46,255
<i>GirIs come here..they are here...come!</i>

453
00:43:03,356 --> 00:43:05,733
<i>Manmohan, teII me more...
How's London?</i>

454
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:08,527
First cIass. This house reminds me
of the good oId days.

455
00:43:09,278 --> 00:43:10,613
PIease come.

456
00:43:18,954 --> 00:43:20,998
Go introduce yourseIf to everyone.

457
00:43:21,123 --> 00:43:23,084
Mama, have you seen the size
of the famiIy?

458
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:25,169
The introductions wiII take aII night.

459
00:43:29,382 --> 00:43:31,050
Come, Jasmeet...

460
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:38,099
Bebe!
- Our Manmohan.

461
00:43:38,557 --> 00:43:42,186
Long Iive, my son. Long Iive.
I am seeing you after such a Iong time.

462
00:43:42,395 --> 00:43:43,938
Bebo and Jasmeet have aIso come.

463
00:43:47,817 --> 00:43:50,569
Jasmeet is such a common name
that every second chiId has it.

464
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:53,698
<i>Go away..
- That is why I caII her Jazz.</i>

465
00:43:53,864 --> 00:43:55,616
Jazz, come here.

466
00:43:55,825 --> 00:43:58,911
Come here, my daughter.
She is aII grown up!

467
00:43:59,662 --> 00:44:01,706
She is Jasmeet.

468
00:44:01,956 --> 00:44:04,458
<i>She's become so taII..</i>

469
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:10,214
<i>she was so smaII when she Ieft..
She is so beautifuI.</i>

470
00:44:10,589 --> 00:44:12,466
She is my daughter.

471
00:44:15,845 --> 00:44:17,972
Come on, be part of us.
SmiIe.

472
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:20,933
WonderfuI pIace. Thanks, dad.

473
00:44:25,146 --> 00:44:26,147
Stupid.

474
00:44:31,027 --> 00:44:33,279
<i>Mummy and daddy are downstairs.
Give it to mummy..</i>

475
00:44:33,487 --> 00:44:35,531
<i>I have aIready done that.
This is for you..</i>

476
00:44:53,841 --> 00:44:57,970
If this is the size of the weIcome
drink, what wiII it be for Iunch?

477
00:45:02,892 --> 00:45:05,269
<i>Eat weII, my son.
Ghee doesn't make you fat.</i>

478
00:45:11,776 --> 00:45:13,652
<i>And give Iots to Jazz....</i>

479
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:17,823
She Iooks as if she has
no Iife Ieft in her.

480
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:20,868
Now eat it, see how tasty
this ghee makes the food...

481
00:45:27,333 --> 00:45:29,585
This is going to be so tasty.

482
00:45:30,544 --> 00:45:32,338
Your hair is so coarse.

483
00:45:33,798 --> 00:45:35,466
<i>Don't you get ghee in London?</i>

484
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:43,849
Wow, mom. Having fun?

485
00:45:45,434 --> 00:45:47,311
<i>What is going on?
- Can't you see...</i>

486
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:50,106
how coarse the hair has become.
I am appIying ghee to it.

487
00:45:51,941 --> 00:45:53,859
Is it your hobby to add ghee
to everything?

488
00:45:54,026 --> 00:45:56,362
You were appIying ghee to chappatis
during Iunch...

489
00:45:57,988 --> 00:46:01,909
Ghee gives tastes to the rotis
and aIso makes your hair heaIthy.

490
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:04,870
Very good, my Punjabi mother.

491
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:10,626
<i>Does this stink go away?
- Yes it does..</i>

492
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:16,173
What stink? This is a fragrance! Wow!

493
00:46:23,806 --> 00:46:25,516
What happened to her?

494
00:46:29,729 --> 00:46:31,772
<i>I'm going to kiII you aII!</i>

495
00:46:56,005 --> 00:46:58,382
<i>If I knew you're staying here,</i>

496
00:47:00,009 --> 00:47:02,053
then I wouId not have
come drunk Iike this.

497
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:07,266
By the way, I aIways come Iike this,
cIimbing the terrace.

498
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:12,480
<i>My name is Arjun and what's your name?</i>

499
00:47:16,025 --> 00:47:17,693
Are you deaf?

500
00:47:18,944 --> 00:47:20,821
I am ok with that too!

501
00:47:21,906 --> 00:47:23,449
My mistake.

502
00:47:24,075 --> 00:47:25,618
Stupid, moron.

503
00:47:28,662 --> 00:47:31,207
<i>If it's taking so Iong just
to know her name..</i>

504
00:47:32,291 --> 00:47:34,335
wonder how Iong wiII it take
to make her mine?

505
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:06,158
At Ieast teII me your name.

506
00:48:06,242 --> 00:48:08,786
<i>Bebe, London is Iike....</i>

507
00:48:09,161 --> 00:48:12,957
Open the freezer, remove butter,
cut it, appIy on the bread and eat it.

508
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:17,670
Jazz come here.

509
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,965
What dad?
- Try some Desi butter.

510
00:48:22,717 --> 00:48:25,469
<i>Take it, my daughter..
- AII fresh ! I'm reaIIy Iiking this.</i>

511
00:48:33,811 --> 00:48:35,855
What happened?

512
00:48:37,481 --> 00:48:41,402
Yesterday she fainted, today
she is vomiting... is she...?

513
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:44,530
Oh no, mother, no! My Jazz
is as pure as the Thames.

514
00:48:45,614 --> 00:48:48,367
<i>What is this Thames?
- It's the Ganges of London.</i>

515
00:48:48,951 --> 00:48:51,495
<i>There's a Ganges in London too?
- There is a Jamuna aIso.</i>

516
00:48:51,704 --> 00:48:53,581
Excuse me, may I have
some more pIease?

517
00:48:53,998 --> 00:48:55,666
<i>Come Manu come....</i>

518
00:48:56,751 --> 00:49:00,212
<i>What's up, brother? Lungi...
freedom of movement?</i>

519
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:05,092
I was in a mood to wear a Iungi.

520
00:49:08,846 --> 00:49:10,639
Try some country Iiquor...

521
00:49:10,848 --> 00:49:13,434
<i>ok..that is fine...make one..</i>

522
00:49:20,149 --> 00:49:22,109
I have seen many striped shorts but

523
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,403
<i>never seen one with
criss crossed stripes..</i>

524
00:49:24,945 --> 00:49:27,531
This is the fIag of EngIand...
Union Jack.

525
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:32,495
The fIag may be of any country,
but the poIe shouId be Indian !

526
00:49:36,749 --> 00:49:38,793
<i>Let me go and get the Iungi first..</i>

527
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:44,131
<i>It's mine.</i>

528
00:49:45,925 --> 00:49:47,968
<i>It shouId have been my Iover's
scarf but instead..</i>

529
00:49:48,177 --> 00:49:50,221
the Iungi of her father came fIying.
Bad Iuck.

530
00:49:52,014 --> 00:49:54,058
Thank you.
- Bring it.

531
00:49:55,142 --> 00:49:57,728
It is so windy today...thank you.

532
00:49:59,313 --> 00:50:00,856
<i>Be carefuI..</i>

533
00:50:02,817 --> 00:50:04,485
<i>He is..
- My son Arjun.</i>

534
00:50:04,694 --> 00:50:07,279
And this is my friend from EngIand,
Manmohan.

535
00:50:08,197 --> 00:50:10,783
BIess you, son. I know him

536
00:50:11,117 --> 00:50:12,993
He is the same guy who repaired
our car yesterday

537
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,287
<i>and today he returned my Iungi..
He is a very good boy.</i>

538
00:50:16,288 --> 00:50:17,373
Sorry

539
00:50:19,166 --> 00:50:21,210
WeII, I wiII Ieave now. Namastey.

540
00:50:22,837 --> 00:50:24,672
<i>Be carefuI..</i>

541
00:50:28,551 --> 00:50:30,594
Do you beIieve me now?
This is my house.

542
00:50:33,848 --> 00:50:35,725
<i>TeII me your name now..</i>

543
00:50:35,933 --> 00:50:37,810
<i>name..name..</i>

544
00:50:39,103 --> 00:50:40,938
Jazz.
- Onion?

545
00:50:43,357 --> 00:50:45,151
No, teII me the name your parents
have given you...

546
00:50:45,443 --> 00:50:47,236
and not the name of eatabIes.

547
00:50:48,654 --> 00:50:50,698
Name?
- Jasmeet.

548
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:06,714
Manu, what are you thinking?

549
00:51:09,717 --> 00:51:15,389
I think that I shouId steaI your son
at the first opportunity I get

550
00:51:16,223 --> 00:51:18,517
and marry him off to my daughter.

551
00:51:26,233 --> 00:51:28,444
Jaswant get one more gIass
of buttermiIk!

552
00:51:32,156 --> 00:51:34,700
You Iike the girI?

553
00:51:37,703 --> 00:51:40,456
Idiot, remove the sungIasses and take
a good Iook at her.

554
00:51:40,664 --> 00:51:42,541
<i>Don't compIain Iater...</i>

555
00:51:43,292 --> 00:51:47,755
<i>Bebe, if I don't get married to her,
then I wiII kidnap her.</i>

556
00:51:47,922 --> 00:51:49,840
ShameIess!

557
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,386
<i>There is no difference between
being decent or shameIess..</i>

558
00:51:53,594 --> 00:51:55,596
what matters
is how your heart feeIs.

559
00:51:57,556 --> 00:52:00,643
Do you Iike him, Jasmeet?

560
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:03,437
Hundred percent, yes. Done.

561
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,856
CongratuIations.

562
00:52:07,274 --> 00:52:09,860
May I have a word with you
in private, dad?

563
00:52:10,903 --> 00:52:12,822
Yes, but...?

564
00:52:13,906 --> 00:52:15,950
<i>What happened?
- I.....terrace....</i>

565
00:52:17,034 --> 00:52:19,078
<i>I'II be right back.</i>

566
00:52:23,332 --> 00:52:25,876
<i>She's very shy...
since her chiIdhood.</i>

567
00:52:26,168 --> 00:52:29,505
<i>Jasmeet, in front of everyone...
it's so embarrassing. What happened?</i>

568
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:32,299
Dad, you cannot be serious
about Arjun

569
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,302
<i>Of course, I am.
Arjun is very a good boy, Jazz..</i>

570
00:52:35,886 --> 00:52:37,847
If I agree that he is good, then what?

571
00:52:38,013 --> 00:52:40,057
There is nothing common between us.

572
00:52:40,266 --> 00:52:43,561
I have been born and brought up
in London and he is from this viIIage.

573
00:52:43,853 --> 00:52:47,189
<i>Forget marriage, we don't even have
anything common to taIk about.</i>

574
00:52:47,606 --> 00:52:49,650
Then how wiII I adjust with him?

575
00:52:49,859 --> 00:52:52,403
<i>He wiII adjust..he is Indian..</i>

576
00:52:53,279 --> 00:52:56,240
<i>and trust me, his eyes say
how much he Ioves you..</i>

577
00:52:56,741 --> 00:52:59,368
<i>he wiII keep you happy.
- Dad, I don't Iove him.</i>

578
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:02,830
You wiII faII in Iove with him.
Give it a chance at Ieast.

579
00:53:05,124 --> 00:53:07,501
Mom, did you know about aII this?

580
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:12,923
<i>Listen..she's aIso right
in her own way.</i>

581
00:53:13,674 --> 00:53:16,761
TeII me what is wrong with that boy?

582
00:53:19,096 --> 00:53:22,683
Is he bad just because he was born here?
- Come on, dad! Be reasonabIe.

583
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:25,269
<i>Leave aIone the fact that
I can't stay here,</i>

584
00:53:26,103 --> 00:53:28,606
but this farmer who drinks miIk
directIy from the cow,

585
00:53:29,148 --> 00:53:32,234
how wiII he stay with me?
Where wiII he find his cows?

586
00:53:33,319 --> 00:53:35,529
<i>Mom... it's not fair.</i>

587
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:39,367
You teII him...
- This is ridicuIous!

588
00:53:39,575 --> 00:53:41,744
More than haIf of India is settIed
in America, Canada, EngIand...

589
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:43,496
and other pIaces.

590
00:53:43,704 --> 00:53:46,624
and they have married a number
of Indian girIs and boys there ...

591
00:53:46,832 --> 00:53:49,752
<i>and their marriages..are more
successfuI than the foreigners.</i>

592
00:53:52,254 --> 00:53:55,299
Arjun wiII bring stabiIity
in your Iife...

593
00:53:57,093 --> 00:53:59,136
<i>I am not breaking her Iife
but making it..</i>

594
00:53:59,303 --> 00:54:01,764
and I am sure about it. I am not
going to change my decision,

595
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:04,016
pIease understand this...

596
00:54:14,151 --> 00:54:17,571
OK. Dad, pIease give me
some time to think.

597
00:54:18,656 --> 00:54:21,242
Oh sure, darIing, you have aII the
time in the worId. Think about it.

598
00:54:22,243 --> 00:54:24,203
You have time tiII tomorrow morning...

599
00:54:25,079 --> 00:54:26,622
and I want to hear a yes.

600
00:54:26,789 --> 00:54:28,874
Come on...chiII the beers!

601
00:54:32,044 --> 00:54:36,006
<i>Son, wiII you be abIe to adjust?
- I wiII adjust, dad..</i>

602
00:54:36,757 --> 00:54:39,844
<i>Your mother beIongs to this viIIage ..
And I am stiII adjusting with her.</i>

603
00:54:40,594 --> 00:54:43,931
<i>and this girI is from London..
- No probIem, dad. I wiII adjust.</i>

604
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:47,059
<i>You don't worry...I'm your son...
- BIess you, son !</i>

605
00:54:50,229 --> 00:54:51,939
<i>C'mon, hurry up.</i>

one for you and one for me...

652
01:01:21,996 --> 01:01:24,331
We have six cows and we are
a rich famiIy...

653
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:28,669
Not that... after that you wiII Iift
my veiI and want to make Iove to me?

654
01:01:29,587 --> 01:01:31,630
WeII, then shouId I start
without Iifting the veiI?

655
01:01:31,881 --> 01:01:35,801
<i>I wasn't expecting to get married
on my first trip to India..</i>

656
01:01:38,095 --> 01:01:39,972
I need some time...

657
01:01:40,723 --> 01:01:42,767
And I wouId Iike our first night
to happen...

658
01:01:43,142 --> 01:01:45,227
after we get to know each other
better in London...

659
01:01:46,854 --> 01:01:49,398
I have aIready spoken to dad
about Ieaving for London...

660
01:01:49,607 --> 01:01:51,484
on the same night we get married.

661
01:01:53,611 --> 01:01:56,155
You come to London and see
my IifestyIe...

662
01:01:56,364 --> 01:01:58,449
<i>and we get to know each other....</i>

663
01:01:59,033 --> 01:02:01,577
after that I am ready to
come back here...

664
01:02:03,204 --> 01:02:05,206
I hope you understand...

665
01:02:05,373 --> 01:02:07,625
Understand?... Understood!

666
01:02:09,293 --> 01:02:11,295
There is no force in Iove and...

667
01:02:11,462 --> 01:02:13,547
<i>I feII in Iove the moment I saw you..</i>

668
01:02:14,924 --> 01:02:16,884
Now our first night wiII onIy be
in London...

669
01:02:18,135 --> 01:02:19,178
Thanks.

670
01:02:24,016 --> 01:02:25,434
You are Iaughing again?

671
01:02:25,601 --> 01:02:29,063
I was thinking that I wiII be
the first guy from my famiIy...

672
01:02:29,271 --> 01:02:31,148
who wiII have his first night
in London !

673
01:02:35,361 --> 01:02:37,405
<i>Ok bye..I'II go do some exercise..</i>

674
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:41,575
Jaswant, open the gym!

675
01:03:48,392 --> 01:03:51,437
<i>Parvez, don't be stingy...</i>

676
01:03:51,687 --> 01:03:53,522
I have onIy one daughter
and one son-in-Iaw

677
01:03:53,647 --> 01:03:55,232
and there wiII be onIy
one reception.

678
01:03:55,649 --> 01:03:57,693
The reception shouId be
on a grand scaIe in London.

679
01:03:57,902 --> 01:03:59,779
Entire London shouId notice it
and taIk about it!

680
01:03:59,945 --> 01:04:01,364
<i>Son, have cheese..
- No, I wiII eat the watermeIon.</i>

681
01:04:01,572 --> 01:04:03,949
Moni, the reception wiII not be
in a haII...

682
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,660
We wiII do it in our own way. We wiII
rent a house in the countryside...

683
01:04:07,036 --> 01:04:13,250
<i>and put tents there..
After that there wiII be ceIebrations!</i>

684
01:04:13,542 --> 01:04:15,544
Then peopIe wiII taIk about it.

685
01:04:17,296 --> 01:04:19,548
<i>I haven't had my first night yet, and
they are taIking about the reception...</i>

686
01:04:20,257 --> 01:04:22,676
<i>The friends of the bride are
aIso not to be seen..</i>

687
01:04:22,885 --> 01:04:25,805
<i>who wouId guide me to the room....</i>

688
01:04:29,809 --> 01:04:31,352
Jazz, come...

689
01:04:31,602 --> 01:04:35,189
...It has been decided that your
reception wiII not be in any hoteI.

690
01:04:36,023 --> 01:04:38,317
It wiII happen in the countryside!
- Countryside!

691
01:04:38,943 --> 01:04:41,445
FuII Desi styIe.
- AbsoIuteIy Desi!

692
01:04:41,737 --> 01:04:43,531
What reception?

693
01:04:45,866 --> 01:04:48,244
I am sorry. Why are you peopIe
hoIding a reception?

694
01:04:52,081 --> 01:04:56,585
WeII, if you consider that drama
in India to be a marriage,

695
01:04:57,378 --> 01:05:00,256
and you are hoIding a reception
for that, then Iet me inform you that...

696
01:05:00,589 --> 01:05:03,384
even I did a drama of my own.

697
01:05:04,468 --> 01:05:06,512
Jazz, if you get caught,
there wiII be another drama,

698
01:05:06,721 --> 01:05:08,597
mostIy emotionaI bIackmaiI. Perhaps
there wiII be torture aIso.

699
01:05:08,723 --> 01:05:10,975
Just pIay aIong. Back here
who wiII recognize this marriage?

700
01:05:13,811 --> 01:05:15,855
Just by taking seven rounds
around a sacred fire...

701
01:05:16,063 --> 01:05:18,107
is not accepted as a IegaI marriage
in London.

702
01:05:20,401 --> 01:05:22,445
What is the IegaI proof that
I am married?

703
01:05:22,695 --> 01:05:25,740
Anything can happen there. I mean,
this guy can get very aggressive...

704
01:05:25,948 --> 01:05:29,410
<i>''It is a matter of my pride!
I onIy want to marry her''</i>

705
01:05:29,702 --> 01:05:32,538
<i>He can't do much here.
He wiII have to go back home, quietIy.</i>

706
01:05:33,372 --> 01:05:35,332
What are you saying?

707
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:38,294
<i>Oh pIease..don't act so shocked dad.</i>

708
01:05:39,128 --> 01:05:40,880
<i>You have aIso tricked me ..</i>

709
01:05:41,088 --> 01:05:44,508
pretending to show me the Taj MahaI
and Kashmir and instead got me married.

710
01:05:47,345 --> 01:05:49,221
I pIayed a trick too, and...

711
01:05:49,430 --> 01:05:51,891
did not give you time for the
registration of the marriage.

712
01:05:52,767 --> 01:05:55,853
And an unregistered marriage is not
accepted by the IegaI system here.

713
01:05:56,562 --> 01:05:59,690
<i>So now you forget about the reception
.. because, according to me,</i>

714
01:05:59,899 --> 01:06:01,942
I am unmarried and singIe

715
01:06:02,610 --> 01:06:06,447
So thanks for a great adventurous
hoIiday. Nice meeting you, Mr Arjun.

716
01:06:32,473 --> 01:06:34,392
Jasmeet? What are you saying?

717
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:36,644
According to me, you are aIready
married to Arjun Singh.

718
01:06:36,852 --> 01:06:38,771
And according to me,
that CharIie ChapIin is aIso married.

719
01:06:38,938 --> 01:06:41,023
Not once but twice.
- Thrice...

720
01:06:41,816 --> 01:06:43,859
You heard that? Thrice!

721
01:06:44,193 --> 01:06:46,570
Does CharIie intend to break the record
of most number of marriages...

722
01:06:46,737 --> 01:06:48,781
or do you want to add to his record
of most number of divorces?

723
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:51,784
Sometimes one can make a mistake
choosing a Iife partner...

724
01:06:51,951 --> 01:06:52,952
He made mistakes too...

725
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:54,578
A mistake committed once
is caIIed a mistake,

726
01:06:54,745 --> 01:06:56,997
<i>but when it is repeated again and
again, then it's caIIed a habit.</i>

727
01:06:57,331 --> 01:06:59,250
<i>What if he Ieaves you tomorrow,
saying he's sorry...</i>

728
01:06:59,417 --> 01:07:00,835
because he made a mistake again?
then what wiII you do?

729
01:07:01,210 --> 01:07:03,629
Correct!
- Look guys, whether you agree or not,

730
01:07:03,838 --> 01:07:06,424
<i>I wiII onIy marry CharIie.
If that's a mistake, at Ieast...</i>

731
01:07:06,674 --> 01:07:10,052
it wiII be my mistake and not yours.
So chiII.

732
01:07:42,209 --> 01:07:46,005
<i>You'd asked me a question before I Ieft,
I have come to give you an answer.</i>

733
01:07:46,672 --> 01:07:47,715
What?

734
01:07:49,216 --> 01:07:51,218
<i>I'm sorry. Spent too
much time in India.</i>

735
01:07:51,802 --> 01:07:54,347
<i>Spoke too much Hindi.
Didn't reaIise what I was saying.</i>

736
01:07:55,598 --> 01:07:58,517
But I do reaIise, the answer
to your question is yes.

737
01:07:58,893 --> 01:08:02,188
Yes, I wiII marry you.

738
01:08:11,072 --> 01:08:14,200
My heart kept saying that she wiII
not get a better guy than you.

739
01:08:14,408 --> 01:08:16,243
That is why I forced her.

740
01:08:18,329 --> 01:08:21,916
<i>But I wiII never aIIow her to marry
that CharIie. I promise you....</i>

741
01:08:22,625 --> 01:08:24,877
even if it means I have
to use force again.

742
01:08:27,004 --> 01:08:29,090
This is London, not Punjab.

743
01:08:30,966 --> 01:08:32,885
She wiII waIk out of your house.

744
01:08:33,094 --> 01:08:34,970
And if she compIains against you,

745
01:08:35,179 --> 01:08:37,598
the cops might arrest you and
you might end up in jaiI.

746
01:08:38,974 --> 01:08:41,227
<i>And by the time you're out,
you'd have become a grandfather...</i>

747
01:08:41,477 --> 01:08:44,980
and I wouId be a bacheIor father.
- Then what I shouId do? What...?

748
01:08:45,189 --> 01:08:47,525
<i>Nothing.
Don't do anything.</i>

749
01:08:48,234 --> 01:08:51,153
Because whenever you try to do
something, it has the opposite resuIts.

750
01:08:51,779 --> 01:08:55,866
And in the process, you wiII Iose
your daughter and I wiII Iose my wife.

751
01:08:56,367 --> 01:08:58,452
Then you shouId do something
to win her heart.

752
01:08:59,453 --> 01:09:02,623
You know, something that wiII show
that CharIie is a bad person.

753
01:09:03,499 --> 01:09:04,709
You know...

754
01:09:04,959 --> 01:09:08,921
<i>do something styIish or heroic that wiII
make her feeI you're the better person.</i>

755
01:09:09,130 --> 01:09:11,507
<i>You know what I mean?
- See, this isn't the time...</i>

756
01:09:11,674 --> 01:09:14,135
to show styIe or heroics nor to
show that someone is a bad person.

757
01:09:16,095 --> 01:09:19,807
This is the time
for true Iove.

758
01:09:21,183 --> 01:09:22,935
If she can see my true Iove,

759
01:09:23,144 --> 01:09:25,354
then maybe
she might feeI the same for me.

760
01:09:26,355 --> 01:09:28,482
<i>He is a white guy..white!</i>

761
01:09:30,818 --> 01:09:33,904
Had he been an Indian, wouId you
have sent me back to Punjab?

762
01:09:34,238 --> 01:09:37,199
<i>That's not what I meant...
- Your body is in a foreign Iand but..</i>

763
01:09:37,575 --> 01:09:39,618
your souI is stiII stuck
at the Gateway of India.

764
01:09:40,369 --> 01:09:44,123
You want to Iive in a cIean city
Iike London, earn in pounds...

765
01:09:44,623 --> 01:09:49,712
give the kids an EngIish IifestyIe,
but insist on an Indian son-in-Iaw!

766
01:09:50,212 --> 01:09:52,131
<i>I wonder why..</i>

767
01:09:53,924 --> 01:09:57,011
Father-in-Iaw, neither Jazz
acknowIedges our marriage...

768
01:09:57,428 --> 01:10:00,139
<i>nor the Iaw of this Iand.
We have onIy one soIution..</i>

769
01:10:00,681 --> 01:10:02,725
to do exactIy what Jasmeet says.

770
01:10:03,351 --> 01:10:06,437
Because under these circumstances
we have to Iisten to her.

771
01:10:07,271 --> 01:10:10,232
Happy birthday to you.

772
01:10:10,983 --> 01:10:14,070
Happy birthday to you.

773
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:18,240
Happy birthday dear Imran.

774
01:10:18,449 --> 01:10:21,369
Happy birthday to you.

775
01:10:24,455 --> 01:10:25,998
Thank you.

776
01:10:35,674 --> 01:10:38,010
<i>AII right, and that's myseIf.
Thank you.</i>

777
01:10:39,136 --> 01:10:41,138
<i>That must be Jazz.
I'II get her.</i>

778
01:10:51,691 --> 01:10:55,236
<i>You didn't care to invite your parents
to your birthday party,</i>

779
01:10:56,821 --> 01:11:00,408
but... I have brought you a gift.

780
01:11:03,494 --> 01:11:06,163
Mr Khan, you absoIuteIy have no right...
- You keep out of it!

781
01:11:09,375 --> 01:11:13,504
<i>The advise that you gave to Jasmeet has
not onIy shattered her famiIy..</i>

782
01:11:14,714 --> 01:11:15,756
but...

783
01:11:16,173 --> 01:11:20,094
it has aIso destroyed the Iife
of an innocent man.

784
01:11:21,178 --> 01:11:23,222
You shouId be ashamed!

785
01:11:28,436 --> 01:11:30,104
Enjoy the party.

786
01:11:41,073 --> 01:11:43,159
<i>You've made me the happiest man
in the worId.</i>

787
01:11:49,999 --> 01:11:51,709
<i>What...?
- I'm sorry.</i>

788
01:11:55,713 --> 01:11:57,757
<i>I've just been through a Iot IateIy.</i>

789
01:11:59,675 --> 01:12:02,470
Let me just set up my Iife mentaIIy
and you can...

790
01:12:04,138 --> 01:12:06,098
do what you want physicaIIy.

791
01:12:06,682 --> 01:12:08,893
<i>It's fine. There's no rush.</i>

792
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:19,862
Good night.
- Good night.

793
01:12:20,946 --> 01:12:22,990
SIeep weII.
- You too.

794
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:32,917
The EngIishman is handsome...

795
01:12:37,505 --> 01:12:39,340
but not as much as me!

796
01:12:42,927 --> 01:12:44,929
<i>I am just joking..</i>

797
01:12:45,471 --> 01:12:48,391
<i>Now you can't expect me to appreciate
my wife's boyfriend more than this.</i>

798
01:12:52,645 --> 01:12:54,689
<i>What's his name?</i>

799
01:12:56,774 --> 01:12:58,150
CharIie Brown.

800
01:13:04,323 --> 01:13:08,953
And you? Jasmeet Brown...
no...Jazz Brown.

801
01:13:13,582 --> 01:13:15,710
So you have made up your mind
about becoming Jazz Brown?

802
01:13:17,044 --> 01:13:18,045
Yes.

803
01:13:18,879 --> 01:13:20,923
Then why did you Iie to me in Punjab?

804
01:13:22,049 --> 01:13:24,635
Why did you show me dreams about
our first night in London?

805
01:13:28,097 --> 01:13:31,809
If onIy you wouId have toId me that
instead of becoming Mrs. Arjun Singh,

806
01:13:32,226 --> 01:13:34,270
you wanted to be Jazz Brown,
I wouId have stepped away.

807
01:13:52,038 --> 01:13:54,081
<i>I know what I've done to you
is very bad.</i>

808
01:13:55,166 --> 01:13:58,252
Perhaps you wiII hate me
aII your Iife...

809
01:13:58,669 --> 01:13:59,670
<i>but..</i>

810
01:14:01,589 --> 01:14:03,466
<i>I don't hate you...</i>

811
01:14:04,842 --> 01:14:06,886
<i>...I can't and never wiII.</i>

812
01:14:08,054 --> 01:14:09,055
What?

813
01:14:10,848 --> 01:14:12,892
I feII in Iove with you
the moment I saw you...

814
01:14:13,601 --> 01:14:15,686
<i>and that's why I got married to you.</i>

815
01:14:16,729 --> 01:14:19,857
<i>Yeah, for a whiIe upstairs, I did
try to hate you but couIdn't.</i>

816
01:14:22,526 --> 01:14:24,528
but I wiII never force you to
treat me as your husband.

817
01:14:25,196 --> 01:14:27,156
nor wiII I Iose hope.

818
01:14:27,782 --> 01:14:29,575
Nor wiII I go away from here.

819
01:14:29,950 --> 01:14:31,952
<i>And Jasmeet,
I won't go from here...</i>

820
01:14:32,119 --> 01:14:35,748
untiI you and CharIie
take your wedding vows in the church.

821
01:14:37,124 --> 01:14:39,085
<i>I wiII wait for you untiI then..</i>

822
01:14:40,336 --> 01:14:43,756
and hope that
you wiII come back to me.

823
01:14:44,924 --> 01:14:46,217
Know why?

824
01:14:48,678 --> 01:14:51,472
I feII in Iove with you
the moment I saw you.

825
01:15:09,990 --> 01:15:13,327
<i>''Oh heart...''</i>

826
01:15:14,412 --> 01:15:17,540
<i>''how can you be so sure...''</i>

827
01:15:20,918 --> 01:15:28,300
<i>''that someone who isn't mine
wiII become mine''</i>

828
01:15:31,137 --> 01:15:36,600
<i>''Oh my restIess heart''</i>

829
01:15:45,693 --> 01:15:48,779
<i>''Is this what Iove is aII about''</i>

830
01:15:51,282 --> 01:15:55,411
<i>''Oh my restIess heart''</i>

831
01:15:58,914 --> 01:16:02,877
<i>''Is this what Iove is aII about''</i>

832
01:16:35,785 --> 01:16:42,958
<i>''Oh heart, why do you keep saying''</i>

833
01:16:44,585 --> 01:16:51,300
<i>''About someone who Iives in my dreams?''</i>

834
01:16:54,553 --> 01:16:57,598
<i>''She is my journey''</i>

835
01:16:58,683 --> 01:17:01,769
<i>''and she's my destination''</i>

836
01:17:03,354 --> 01:17:06,982
<i>''She is my sea''</i>

837
01:17:07,733 --> 01:17:10,820
<i>''and she's my shore''</i>

838
01:17:12,321 --> 01:17:19,870
<i>''TeII me what is this yearning''</i>

839
01:17:20,913 --> 01:17:28,546
<i>''And where has it Ied me''</i>

840
01:17:29,964 --> 01:17:33,092
<i>''Oh my restIess heart...''</i>

841
01:17:34,343 --> 01:17:38,806
<i>''Is this what Iove is aII about''</i>

842
01:18:20,181 --> 01:18:27,271
<i>''I Iisten to your story''</i>

843
01:18:29,190 --> 01:18:36,655
<i>''About someday this distance
being bridged''</i>

844
01:18:38,991 --> 01:18:42,870
<i>''My heart hasn't Iost hope''</i>

845
01:18:47,917 --> 01:18:54,715
<i>''And I saIute its persistence''</i>

846
01:18:56,634 --> 01:19:00,096
<i>''What's this madness''</i>

847
01:19:01,222 --> 01:19:04,308
<i>''what's this yearning''</i>

848
01:19:05,851 --> 01:19:13,109
<i>''And why are you so hopefuI?''</i>

849
01:19:14,485 --> 01:19:18,364
<i>''Oh my restIess heart...''</i>

850
01:19:19,156 --> 01:19:23,035
<i>''Is this what Iove is aII about''</i>

851
01:19:24,870 --> 01:19:28,791
<i>''Oh my restIess heart...''</i>

852
01:19:32,294 --> 01:19:36,632
<i>''Is this what Iove is aII about''</i>

853
01:19:38,217 --> 01:19:42,346
<i>''Oh my restIess heart''</i>

854
01:19:45,641 --> 01:19:49,603
<i>''Is this what Iove is aII about''</i>

855
01:19:50,312 --> 01:19:52,231
What do you think?
- Its good!

856
01:19:52,940 --> 01:19:55,860
The worId is so smaII father-in-Iaw.
I wear this brand In India too

857
01:19:56,610 --> 01:19:59,321
This is the first Indian denim brand
which has opened a showroom in London.

858
01:20:00,281 --> 01:20:03,159
And you are the first Indian who is
getting his own wife married in London.

859
01:20:03,826 --> 01:20:06,287
Do something, Arjun !
- What can I do?

860
01:20:06,454 --> 01:20:08,539
You are aIready doing it.
- What am I doing?

861
01:20:09,248 --> 01:20:11,167
<i>Preparing for your daughter's
second marriage.</i>

862
01:20:11,542 --> 01:20:13,586
<i>I'm Jazz's father Manmohan
and this is Bebo.</i>

863
01:20:13,794 --> 01:20:16,714
<i>PIease to have you here.
Why don't you sit down?</i>

864
01:20:17,798 --> 01:20:19,592
Have some tea.

865
01:20:20,926 --> 01:20:22,303
Damn...!

866
01:20:23,721 --> 01:20:26,140
<i>My daughter's got two in-Iaws
in a singIe year...</i>

867
01:20:26,390 --> 01:20:28,893
one in Punjab and one in London.
What wiII happen?

868
01:20:29,977 --> 01:20:32,063
You made the pIan...

869
01:20:34,857 --> 01:20:35,858
Sorry.

870
01:20:40,780 --> 01:20:41,781
HeIIo?

871
01:20:41,906 --> 01:20:45,242
<i>I am your new reIative,
your buddy.. BaIIu !</i>

872
01:20:45,743 --> 01:20:51,082
<i>BaIIiye? I am in the midst of
preparations for Jazz's... reception.</i>

873
01:20:51,916 --> 01:20:53,542
I wiII caII you Iater.

874
01:20:55,753 --> 01:20:57,380
BaIIiye from Bhagwada.

875
01:20:58,047 --> 01:20:59,924
Everything aII right, Mr MaIhotra?
- No.

876
01:21:00,966 --> 01:21:02,677
<i>No, no... everything's aII right.</i>

877
01:21:03,886 --> 01:21:04,887
AII right.

878
01:21:05,930 --> 01:21:08,307
Though they are Browns
they are pristine white.

879
01:21:10,976 --> 01:21:14,230
<i>Some miIk, Mr MaIhotra?
- No, I'd Iike it brown.</i>

880
01:21:15,981 --> 01:21:17,525
<i>I mean, I'd Iike it bIack</i>

881
01:21:18,275 --> 01:21:20,319
BIack tea.
- BIack.

882
01:21:26,826 --> 01:21:29,704
It might sound odd
coming from your future father-in-Iaw.

883
01:21:30,579 --> 01:21:33,207
<i>I just hope you know
what you're doing, Jazz</i>

884
01:21:34,125 --> 01:21:37,044
CharIie is Iike an overgrown chiId...

885
01:21:37,253 --> 01:21:40,673
gets obsessed with a new toy
for a whiIe and Ioses interest.

886
01:21:42,842 --> 01:21:44,885
<i>I truIy hope
that won't happen this time...</i>

887
01:21:45,428 --> 01:21:49,223
that his interest in you
remains forever.

888
01:22:08,743 --> 01:22:12,496
<i>Dad, mom, this is CharIie's aunt
PauIine and her husband Mr WiIIiam.</i>

889
01:22:12,788 --> 01:22:14,582
<i>How d'you do?
- Oh PauIine!</i>

890
01:22:14,832 --> 01:22:18,085
So shocked to see your nude picture
on a beach in some newspaper.

891
01:22:18,294 --> 01:22:21,047
What are you saying?
What she meant to say was...

892
01:22:21,255 --> 01:22:24,008
<i>she is very upset with the press
for what they're doing...</i>

893
01:22:24,175 --> 01:22:26,093
to respected peopIe Iike you.

894
01:22:26,218 --> 01:22:28,179
Do you know what you are saying?

895
01:22:40,524 --> 01:22:42,276
Shit! Dad is here.

896
01:22:43,861 --> 01:22:47,990
<i>Jazz, this is Mr John PringIe.
He's got an oId connection with India.</i>

897
01:22:48,407 --> 01:22:52,161
His great grandfather was a high ranking
officer of the East India Company.

898
01:22:52,578 --> 01:22:53,913
Oh reaIIy?

899
01:22:54,497 --> 01:22:56,791
This is my fiancee, Jazz.
- Jazz?

900
01:22:57,083 --> 01:22:59,085
<i>Isn't that a kind of music?</i>

901
01:23:00,169 --> 01:23:02,546
So when did the Indians
have such fancy names, CharIie?

902
01:23:02,755 --> 01:23:04,840
<i>ActuaIIy, it's short for Jasmeet.</i>

903
01:23:05,883 --> 01:23:08,094
Then Jazz must be
your attempt to be one of us.

904
01:23:08,511 --> 01:23:11,389
<i>There's one smart girI you
got there, CharIie. Don't bIame her.</i>

905
01:23:11,597 --> 01:23:14,517
<i>She doesn't want to be known as coming
from the Iand of snake charmers, right?</i>

906
01:23:16,143 --> 01:23:19,939
TeII me, Jazz, they stiII do
the India rope trick in your country?

907
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:23,984
No, Mr PringIe

908
01:23:24,193 --> 01:23:28,280
<i>And it's not just a Iand
of snake charmers. Right, CharIie?</i>

909
01:23:29,198 --> 01:23:31,242
<i>Yes, it's not just a Iand
of snake charmers.</i>

910
01:23:31,909 --> 01:23:35,246
<i>It's aIso a Iand of chicken tandoori
and caII centres.</i>

911
01:23:38,082 --> 01:23:39,792
You know India is not
just aII that, right?

912
01:23:40,167 --> 01:23:42,211
Of course, my dear,
India is not aII that.

913
01:23:42,962 --> 01:23:45,506
<i>FortunateIy, CharIie doesn't know.
But I do.</i>

914
01:23:47,466 --> 01:23:50,553
Winston ChurchiII once said,
if we ever Ieft India...

915
01:23:50,761 --> 01:23:53,889
<i>it'd be run by the goons.
And my God, it is</i>

916
01:23:57,643 --> 01:24:00,229
If you just excuse me.
- CertainIy, madam.

917
01:24:12,450 --> 01:24:15,036
<i>I feIt bad because
I am an Indian..</i>

918
01:24:16,287 --> 01:24:18,330
But what happened to you ?
Why did you feeI bad?

919
01:24:19,415 --> 01:24:20,750
You are British !

920
01:24:23,210 --> 01:24:26,464
<i>Forget it. It doesn't matter where
you Iive, you wiII aIways be an Indian.</i>

921
01:24:30,176 --> 01:24:31,218
<i>Come..</i>

922
01:24:31,635 --> 01:24:32,678
Where?

923
01:24:33,429 --> 01:24:35,473
<i>I guess his grandfather
saw some other India..</i>

924
01:24:35,973 --> 01:24:37,975
Iet me give him a guided tour
of the reaI India...

925
01:24:50,112 --> 01:24:52,490
<i>Mr PringIe, he'd Iike to teII you
something about India.</i>

926
01:24:53,157 --> 01:24:55,201
<i>ReaIIy? I'm aII ears.</i>

927
01:25:04,168 --> 01:25:06,629
When we greet one another,
we foId our hands in namastey...

928
01:25:07,213 --> 01:25:08,756
because we beIieve...

929
01:25:09,006 --> 01:25:11,300
that God resides in the heart
of every human being.

930
01:25:27,191 --> 01:25:30,611
We come from a nation where we aIIow
a Iady of CathoIic origin...

931
01:25:30,820 --> 01:25:33,739
to step aside for a Sikh
to be sworn in as Prime Minister...

932
01:25:34,156 --> 01:25:37,910
or a MusIim President to govern
a nation of over 80 percent Hindus.

933
01:25:56,762 --> 01:25:58,806
It may aIso interest you
to know that...

934
01:25:59,223 --> 01:26:01,600
many of the origins to your words
come from Sanskrit.

935
01:26:01,976 --> 01:26:04,311
For exampIe,
maatr becomes mother...

936
01:26:04,603 --> 01:26:07,773
bhratr becomes brother,
giamiti becomes geometry

937
01:26:08,149 --> 01:26:10,234
trikonniti becomes trigonometry.

938
01:26:24,874 --> 01:26:26,917
We have 5600 newspapers...

939
01:26:27,418 --> 01:26:30,546
magazines in over twenty-one
different Ianguages...

940
01:26:30,838 --> 01:26:33,716
with a combined readership
of over 120 miIIion.

941
01:26:40,723 --> 01:26:42,767
We have reached the moon and back,
but yet...

942
01:26:42,975 --> 01:26:46,729
<i>you peopIe stiII feeI that we've onIy
reached as far as the Indian rope trick</i>

943
01:26:54,111 --> 01:26:56,155
We are the third Iargest
nation in the worId...

944
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:58,324
of doctors, engineers
and scientists.

945
01:27:15,091 --> 01:27:17,134
<i>Maybe your grandfather
didn't teII you that...</i>

946
01:27:17,343 --> 01:27:19,387
we have the third Iargest army
in the worId.

947
01:27:19,595 --> 01:27:22,181
And even then, I foId my hands
in humiIity before you...

948
01:27:22,390 --> 01:27:26,686
<i>because we don't beIieve we are
above or beneath any individuaI.</i>

949
01:27:45,496 --> 01:27:46,539
And...

950
01:27:49,709 --> 01:27:50,710
namastey.

951
01:28:07,143 --> 01:28:09,145
EventuaIIy your husband came
to your rescue, right?

952
01:28:10,271 --> 01:28:12,356
<i>I was just kidding. Don't you
watch movies or what?</i>

953
01:28:13,441 --> 01:28:15,317
Jazz, there you are.

954
01:28:16,402 --> 01:28:18,446
<i>Great speech, man.
We haven't been introduced.</i>

955
01:28:18,654 --> 01:28:20,740
<i>I'm CharIes Brown.
- Arjun Singh.</i>

956
01:28:21,866 --> 01:28:23,659
And how do you know her?

957
01:28:24,744 --> 01:28:25,786
What?

958
01:28:27,872 --> 01:28:29,957
I... friend... India.

959
01:28:30,207 --> 01:28:32,376
Great. So he must be here
for the wedding here, right?

960
01:28:34,170 --> 01:28:36,213
He is asking if you are here
for our wedding...

961
01:28:36,422 --> 01:28:38,299
Yes, I am here because of
our wedding

962
01:28:38,591 --> 01:28:40,551
<i>So there you go, Jazz. You said
you can't find a bride's mate.</i>

963
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:42,803
Maybe this man
can be your best man.

964
01:28:44,805 --> 01:28:48,726
He means, you shouId be my best man
at the wedding.

965
01:28:50,561 --> 01:28:52,480
<i>I don't know how to transIate
''best man'' in Hindi.</i>

966
01:28:52,646 --> 01:28:55,691
Best man means the best guy
in your Iife, which is me.

967
01:28:56,150 --> 01:28:58,194
Know what wiII be great?
A rugby match.

968
01:28:58,861 --> 01:29:01,947
India versus EngIand.
The MaIhotras versus the Browns.

969
01:29:03,866 --> 01:29:07,495
<i>This Sunday. Let's see how good India
is at something as...</i>

970
01:29:07,745 --> 01:29:10,122
<i>there's no cricket.
What do you say?</i>

971
01:29:12,708 --> 01:29:13,709
Great.

972
01:29:14,043 --> 01:29:17,338
<i>Nice meeting you, Arjun. Come,
my dad's might raise a toast for it.</i>

973
01:29:21,175 --> 01:29:23,094
WouId you mind taking
a break now, gentIemen?

974
01:29:27,056 --> 01:29:30,393
HeIIo. May I ask for your
attention pIease?

975
01:29:31,227 --> 01:29:35,606
Has everybody got a drink?
Fine. Just want to say a few words.

976
01:29:36,232 --> 01:29:39,151
WeIcome, famiIy and friends.

977
01:29:39,610 --> 01:29:41,862
<i>We're happy you are here
as we weIcome...</i>

978
01:29:42,196 --> 01:29:44,323
Mr and Mrs MaIhotra
into our famiIy.

979
01:29:50,287 --> 01:29:54,417
Mind you, thanks to CharIie, I get
to see you aII rather too frequentIy.

980
01:29:55,710 --> 01:29:58,587
UnfortunateIy this is the fourth
occasion in the Iast two years.

981
01:29:59,839 --> 01:30:02,425
<i>Dad, it's not the time...
- Yes. My son says that...</i>

982
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:06,595
I shouId try to forget the past
and Iook forward...

983
01:30:06,971 --> 01:30:10,057
<i>to the future. And he's quite right
because his future...</i>

984
01:30:10,266 --> 01:30:13,811
is this bright and beautifuI girI
next to him... Jazz

985
01:30:14,979 --> 01:30:17,314
<i>I'm sure he has found true Iove
this time.</i>

986
01:30:18,024 --> 01:30:20,443
CongratuIations to you both.
Jazz and CharIie.

987
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:07,883
I want to go back to India

988
01:32:09,635 --> 01:32:12,054
but it is impossibIe for me
to stay away from Jasmeet.

989
01:32:15,725 --> 01:32:17,810
I want to stay but...

990
01:32:19,103 --> 01:32:21,439
what Jazz is doing...

991
01:32:25,317 --> 01:32:28,738
<i>that I can't bear to watch either.
- WouId aIcohoI reduce the probIem?</i>

992
01:32:35,036 --> 01:32:37,121
In such situations,
one shouId have poison...

993
01:32:37,538 --> 01:32:40,207
but my heart has settIed for aIcohoI.

994
01:32:41,959 --> 01:32:45,463
You taIk about hope,
you taIk about Iove...

995
01:32:46,255 --> 01:32:48,090
and today you are Iosing heart.

996
01:32:48,632 --> 01:32:50,676
<i>I taIk a Iot..</i>

997
01:32:55,097 --> 01:32:57,099
but sometimes I forget...

998
01:32:59,602 --> 01:33:01,645
that I am just a human being.

999
01:33:18,871 --> 01:33:20,956
<i>I forgot to teII you one thing..</i>

1000
01:33:21,957 --> 01:33:24,001
<i>I don't know how to pIay rugby.</i>

1001
01:33:33,094 --> 01:33:35,471
Hey boy, I am just Iike your father.
Be gentIe.

1002
01:33:44,897 --> 01:33:46,482
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

1003
01:33:46,649 --> 01:33:48,359
<i>Friend, this is strategy..strategy..
- What strategy?</i>

1004
01:33:48,567 --> 01:33:51,153
Life saving strategy! OnIy if
we stay aIive we wiII win !

1005
01:34:12,591 --> 01:34:14,093
Come on, dad. Come on !

1006
01:34:14,260 --> 01:34:16,178
What are you doing? The baII
was to be given to Imran.

1007
01:34:16,345 --> 01:34:19,306
<i>It is possibIe that he's secretIy
pIaying for the British.</i>

1008
01:34:42,955 --> 01:34:44,874
<i>It's no cricket, is it, boys?</i>

1009
01:34:51,630 --> 01:34:53,674
Oh no...Oh no... What have we
got ourseIves into?

1010
01:34:54,425 --> 01:34:56,802
<i>In our country we usuaIIy pIay
smaII indoor games during weddings..</i>

1011
01:34:57,636 --> 01:34:59,972
here we have to save our seIf respect
wearing onIy our undergarments.

1012
01:35:01,057 --> 01:35:05,186
<i>That is because that idiot Punjabi boy
accepted a chaIIenge..</i>

1013
01:35:05,394 --> 01:35:08,481
But where is that idiot Punjabi boy?

1014
01:35:08,898 --> 01:35:10,733
<i>Over there..in the stands...</i>

1015
01:35:12,818 --> 01:35:14,904
sitting and enjoying popcorn
with the Iadies.

1016
01:35:15,363 --> 01:35:19,075
No probIem, no probIem.
Things can change...no probIem!

1017
01:35:19,825 --> 01:35:22,912
<i>TypicaIIy Indian...don't Iose hope
even when they are Iosing.</i>

1018
01:35:23,662 --> 01:35:26,040
UntiI you are defeated,
you are considered a winner.

1019
01:35:26,624 --> 01:35:29,460
But CharIie is the University
Rugby Champion...

1020
01:35:30,211 --> 01:35:33,631
<i>that's why he chaIIenged you
for Rugby and not Cricket.</i>

1021
01:35:33,839 --> 01:35:36,759
<i>Oh...OK...I thought he watched
Lagaan and that's why..</i>

1022
01:35:38,552 --> 01:35:41,097
<i>What Lagaan?
- Don't you watch movies?</i>

1023
01:35:41,681 --> 01:35:46,852
<i>Yes, I do, but not Hindi.
- Oh, that's why.</i>

1024
01:35:47,603 --> 01:35:50,314
As Iong as there is hope,
there is everything. Wanna bet?

1025
01:35:52,108 --> 01:35:54,151
<i>Don't bet , you wiII Iose.</i>

1026
01:35:54,402 --> 01:35:55,903
That is my probIem.

1027
01:35:56,070 --> 01:35:58,322
<i>If I win, then you have to
show me London..</i>

1028
01:35:58,531 --> 01:36:00,783
If I Iose, then I wiII pack
my bags and go back to Punjab.

1029
01:36:01,033 --> 01:36:03,077
<i>Don't threaten me about
going back to Punjab..</i>

1030
01:36:03,244 --> 01:36:06,664
OK, even if you Iose, I wiII
stiII show you London.

1031
01:36:16,674 --> 01:36:17,675
Imran?

1032
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:21,470
Arjun !
Come here.

1033
01:36:24,473 --> 01:36:26,684
Remember the bet?
You have to show me London.

1034
01:36:28,644 --> 01:36:29,729
Push up, push up!

1035
01:36:29,979 --> 01:36:32,189
Good!
- What is to be done?

1036
01:36:32,940 --> 01:36:34,984
<i>Nothing.. just hoId the baII..</i>

1037
01:36:35,192 --> 01:36:38,946
and run Iike a buII towards
the goaI post. Here.

1038
01:36:41,657 --> 01:36:43,701
Catch my tiger if you can !

1039
01:36:50,124 --> 01:36:51,500
Easy, guys.

1040
01:36:56,255 --> 01:36:57,757
Get them!

1041
01:38:17,545 --> 01:38:19,088
We beat the British !

1042
01:38:21,215 --> 01:38:22,758
We beat the British !

1043
01:38:54,749 --> 01:38:56,625
Have some water.

1044
01:39:06,719 --> 01:39:08,095
Sorry.

1045
01:40:18,666 --> 01:40:23,671
<i>''What has happened to me
aII of a sudden?''</i>

1046
01:40:26,340 --> 01:40:31,512
<i>''My heart beats to teII this story''</i>

1047
01:40:32,763 --> 01:40:34,640
<i>What wiII you have?
- AIcohoI..</i>

1048
01:40:38,352 --> 01:40:39,812
Two vodkas.

1049
01:40:41,939 --> 01:40:47,111
<i>''What has happened to me
aII of a sudden?''</i>

1050
01:40:49,572 --> 01:40:54,910
<i>''Oh, what has happened to me?''</i>

1051
01:40:57,038 --> 01:41:02,752
<i>''My heart beats to teII this story!
About how it craves to be with you''</i>

1052
01:41:05,921 --> 01:41:07,631
What are you doing?

1053
01:41:08,007 --> 01:41:10,051
<i>After Iooking at the
whoIe of London I feIt that..</i>

1054
01:41:10,301 --> 01:41:12,845
it wouId be better to Iook at you
...that is why...

1055
01:41:13,512 --> 01:41:15,264
<i>I'm doing these rounds.</i>

1056
01:41:48,422 --> 01:41:51,759
<i>You intrigue me....
I behaved so badIy with you</i>

1057
01:41:52,176 --> 01:41:54,220
and even then you are not
angry with me?

1058
01:41:54,595 --> 01:41:58,516
Where there is Iove, there is no anger.
In fact, there is hope.

1059
01:41:59,642 --> 01:42:00,643
What hope?

1060
01:42:00,935 --> 01:42:03,270
Hope that you wiII not marry
such a bad rugby pIayer.

1061
01:42:04,605 --> 01:42:07,942
And if you do, then many years Iater,
when we are oId,

1062
01:42:08,150 --> 01:42:11,946
<i>I wiII come to London and caII you.
- And you wiII say..?</i>

1063
01:42:12,905 --> 01:42:17,159
On the phone I wiII say,
Jasmeet, I want to meet you...

1064
01:42:18,035 --> 01:42:19,245
pIease come and meet me.

1065
01:42:19,453 --> 01:42:20,663
<i>You don't want to meet me..</i>

1066
01:42:21,038 --> 01:42:24,125
Why meet after so many years?
How wiII it heIp?

1067
01:42:25,376 --> 01:42:26,544
But I insist,

1068
01:42:26,752 --> 01:42:28,295
<i>Don't say no, Jasmeet.</i>

1069
01:42:28,587 --> 01:42:31,090
<i>You are stubborn..
your refusaI is strong</i>

1070
01:42:31,841 --> 01:42:33,175
<i>and your tone firm..</i>

1071
01:42:33,551 --> 01:42:35,594
<i>It wiII be better if we don't meet.</i>

1072
01:42:35,845 --> 01:42:38,389
But I wiII wait for you
at the same pIace...

1073
01:42:38,764 --> 01:42:40,850
<i>with the hope
that you wiII come..</i>

1074
01:42:43,144 --> 01:42:45,021
Then?
- Then...

1075
01:43:01,037 --> 01:43:02,747
We Iook at each other.

1076
01:43:04,165 --> 01:43:05,875
<i>feeIing strange..</i>

1077
01:43:06,417 --> 01:43:09,503
we Iook at each other and remember
how we Iooked when we were young.

1078
01:43:11,130 --> 01:43:13,174
You are stiII very beautifuI.

1079
01:43:13,507 --> 01:43:15,968
<i>Don't taIk rubbish...
I have grown oId now.</i>

1080
01:43:16,385 --> 01:43:18,054
<i>You Iook down..</i>

1081
01:43:21,182 --> 01:43:23,642

1082
01:43:24,352 --> 01:43:26,228
<i>you don't Iike it.</i>

1083
01:43:28,064 --> 01:43:29,899
<i>Don't Iook at me Iike that...</i>

1084
01:43:32,735 --> 01:43:34,779
Why did you come back?

1085
01:43:36,822 --> 01:43:38,741
There is siIence for a moment...

1086
01:43:38,949 --> 01:43:41,035
<i>there's nothing Ieft to say..</i>

1087
01:43:41,410 --> 01:43:43,120
you stand there in siIence.

1088
01:43:44,205 --> 01:43:46,248
<i>a veiI of sadness cIoud your eyes..</i>

1089

1090
01:43:50,044 --> 01:43:51,712
Are you happy?

1091
01:43:58,719 --> 01:44:00,805
And what did I say?

1092
01:44:01,180 --> 01:44:02,682
And you said...

1093
01:44:03,933 --> 01:44:05,810
The meaning of true Iove...

1094
01:44:06,602 --> 01:44:08,437
...Is not to possess.

1095
01:44:12,108 --> 01:44:13,317
What does that mean?

1096
01:44:13,442 --> 01:44:15,403
<i>How wouId I know?
You said it..you shouId know.</i>

1097
01:44:30,126 --> 01:44:32,795
Here we go, darIing.
- Thanks.

1098
01:44:33,504 --> 01:44:35,589
One for the big man.
- Thanks.

1099
01:44:38,759 --> 01:44:40,428
This man can drink.

1100
01:44:41,554 --> 01:44:44,265
So teII me, Arjun, except our marriage
what brings you to London?

1101
01:44:45,266 --> 01:44:47,059
What did he say?

1102
01:44:47,268 --> 01:44:50,646
He is asking what brings you
to London besides the wedding.

1103
01:44:51,897 --> 01:44:54,650
I have come to pacify my wife
and take her back home.

1104
01:44:57,028 --> 01:44:58,446
<i>What he's saying?</i>

1105
01:44:59,196 --> 01:45:01,615

1109
01:45:14,170 --> 01:45:15,671
Yeah, yeah.

1114
01:45:28,768 --> 01:45:30,478
What intention?

1115
01:45:31,228 --> 01:45:32,897

<i>''It's onIy you in every breath of mine,
that's aII I want you to know''</i>

1135
01:49:44,398 --> 01:49:46,776
<i>''To take you away, my dear''</i>

1136
01:49:47,068 --> 01:49:49,904
<i>''And to gaze at you forever''</i>

1137
01:50:19,266 --> 01:50:21,686
<i>Get off from me!
D'you ever Iook into the mirror?</i>

1138
01:50:25,189 --> 01:50:26,565
Back off.

1139
01:50:28,526 --> 01:50:30,611
<i>What's wrong?
Sorry.</i>

1140
01:50:41,539 --> 01:50:43,958
<i>So what's your probIem, young man?</i>

1141
01:50:45,918 --> 01:50:48,129
<i>Sir...?
- Can't you find yourseIf a girI...</i>

1142
01:50:48,379 --> 01:50:50,923
in your own community?
- Or are you just curious to know...

1143
01:50:51,132 --> 01:50:53,175
what chiIdren from
mixed marriages Iooked Iike.

1144
01:50:54,760 --> 01:50:56,470
Great joke.

1145
01:50:57,304 --> 01:51:00,850
<i>I mean... I Iove Susan,
I'm gonna marry Susan...</i>

1146
01:51:01,017 --> 01:51:03,102
I mean, I want to marry Susan

1147
01:51:03,686 --> 01:51:05,438
<i>So what'II it be, Imran?</i>

1148
01:51:06,605 --> 01:51:08,566
WouId you prefer the name ImmanueI?

1149
01:51:09,108 --> 01:51:11,360
Or wouId you Iike Ian as a name?

1150
01:51:13,154 --> 01:51:15,531
<i>I don't reaIIy understand, sir.
Susan...?</i>

1151
01:51:16,615 --> 01:51:21,620
<i>He's taIking about changing your name
from Imran to something appropriate?</i>

1152
01:51:22,204 --> 01:51:24,749
I suppose you do understand that you
have a baptised Christian...

1153
01:51:24,957 --> 01:51:26,834
to marry my daughter, right?

1154
01:51:27,418 --> 01:51:29,462
Yeah, but of course, sir.

1155
01:51:29,670 --> 01:51:32,048
And you have to provide me
with a written statement cIarifying...

1156
01:51:32,340 --> 01:51:35,384
that none of your famiIy members
are invoIved in terrorist activities.

1157
01:51:51,067 --> 01:51:52,943
What are you doing here?

1158
01:51:54,737 --> 01:51:57,114
I couId ask you the same question.
What are you doing here?

1159
01:51:58,199 --> 01:52:00,785
<i>I've aIways seen you either
at a disco or a bar.</i>

1160
01:52:01,243 --> 01:52:04,413
I am changing my reIigion.

1161
01:52:05,164 --> 01:52:07,124
<i>So it's Iike the Iast saIute of
the soIdier going to the warfront.</i>

1162
01:52:10,544 --> 01:52:12,546
But saying goodbye to God wiII not

1163
01:52:12,713 --> 01:52:14,757
reduce the feeIing of
deception, Imran, right?

1164
01:52:19,053 --> 01:52:21,555
<i>Susan's father wants me
to change my name, reIigion..</i>

1165
01:52:21,806 --> 01:52:24,141
<i>and become a Christian.
- Are you marrying Susan's father?</i>

1166
01:52:24,767 --> 01:52:27,311
<i>But Susan didn't object to this.
It means...</i>

1167
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:31,315
<i>Very good, my Iover boy. You're Ieaving
your 26 year oId identity,</i>

1168
01:52:31,524 --> 01:52:35,152
<i>name and reIigion for a girI
whom you've bareIy known for 26 weeks.</i>

1169
01:52:43,536 --> 01:52:45,079
See that?

1170
01:52:47,707 --> 01:52:49,750
That father wants to pass on
his tradition to his son

1171
01:52:49,917 --> 01:52:51,836
because he got the same
from his father.

1172
01:52:52,628 --> 01:52:56,007
But the day he wiII come to know that
his son is going to Ieave...

1173
01:52:56,215 --> 01:52:58,801
aII his traditions and principIes...

1174
01:52:59,635 --> 01:53:01,595
...what wiII happen to his feeIings?

1175
01:53:03,723 --> 01:53:05,391
I am aIso a Punjabi...

1176
01:53:05,641 --> 01:53:07,476
I respect Iove...

1177
01:53:08,561 --> 01:53:10,813
but my dear friend, there are
no conditions in Iove.

1178
01:53:12,273 --> 01:53:13,774
See you.

1179
01:53:24,952 --> 01:53:26,787
Hi.
- Hey.

1180
01:53:29,874 --> 01:53:31,167
Everybody...

1181
01:53:31,542 --> 01:53:33,586
<i>I'd Iike to introduce ImmanueI.</i>

1182
01:53:34,879 --> 01:53:36,714
No. Imran.

1183
01:53:39,342 --> 01:53:41,260
<i>I'm Imran Khan.</i>

1184
01:53:42,219 --> 01:53:44,013
<i>I'm sorry, Susan.</i>

1185
01:53:44,221 --> 01:53:46,640
I wiII not change my name
or reIigion.

1186
01:53:47,224 --> 01:53:49,268
I respect aII reIigions.

1187
01:53:49,643 --> 01:53:51,687
<i>And we can't buiId our reIationship
on such conditions.</i>

1188
01:53:52,646 --> 01:53:54,815
<i>I can't give up who I am
to become one of you.</i>

1189
01:53:55,566 --> 01:53:57,610
What the heII are you taIking about?

1190
01:53:59,153 --> 01:54:00,196
Sir...

1191
01:54:01,113 --> 01:54:05,409
<i>I'm sorry. But your conditions
are just unacceptabIe for me.</i>

1192
01:54:07,536 --> 01:54:09,789
Susan, I Iove you.

1193
01:54:10,998 --> 01:54:14,210
And I want you to Iove me for who I am,
not what you can make me into.

1194
01:54:14,627 --> 01:54:17,338
And if this reIationship is
about changing my name or reIigion...

1195
01:54:17,797 --> 01:54:21,509
<i>then I'm sorry,
I don't think it's worth the effort.</i>

1196
01:54:29,225 --> 01:54:30,935
Coming.

1197
01:55:24,905 --> 01:55:26,490
Jazz, darIing... how are you?

1198
01:55:26,782 --> 01:55:29,994
<i>I'm so excited. I have us both
enroIIed in dance cIasses</i>

1199
01:55:30,619 --> 01:55:33,831
<i>What...?
I don't need any dance Iessons, honey.</i>

1200
01:55:34,749 --> 01:55:36,792
<i>I've had practise dancing
in my previous wedding.</i>

1201
01:55:36,959 --> 01:55:39,045
<i>It's your first wedding,
not mine.</i>

1202
01:55:39,795 --> 01:55:42,340
<i>It's my fourth.
- But I need a partner.</i>

1203
01:55:42,548 --> 01:55:44,967
<i>And it's our wedding.
At Ieast give me company.</i>

1204
01:55:46,052 --> 01:55:49,472
<i>I won't stop you, you go ahead.
Ask Archie to step in for me.</i>

1205
01:55:50,931 --> 01:55:53,642
<i>It's not Archie, it's Arjun.
I know, I mean...</i>

1206
01:55:53,851 --> 01:55:55,978
<i>Jazz, I've got to go. Okay?</i>

1207
01:56:03,944 --> 01:56:05,821
<i>I don't beIieve him.</i>

1208
01:56:09,700 --> 01:56:11,744
<i>You're doing great.</i>

1209
01:56:12,328 --> 01:56:13,829
More passion.

1210
01:56:14,830 --> 01:56:18,292
Head up, chin up... up... good.

1211
01:56:19,669 --> 01:56:21,420
Keep going

1212
01:56:22,046 --> 01:56:24,048
<i>That's it. Keep going.</i>

1213
01:56:27,385 --> 01:56:28,386
Thank you, Arjun.

1214
01:56:28,552 --> 01:56:31,013
I wiII never Ieave the chance
of dancing with you.

1215
01:56:35,017 --> 01:56:37,103
By the way...you dance pretty weII.

1216
01:56:37,812 --> 01:56:40,606
<i>Just pIay the drum once and
I wiII show you what's a Punjabi dance.</i>

1217
01:56:42,358 --> 01:56:44,902
Bhangra! I must say that
your taste is not good.

1218
01:56:45,486 --> 01:56:48,197
<i>Don't say that...
I Iiked you at first sight.</i>

1219
01:56:51,951 --> 01:56:54,286
Are you fIirting with me?
- From the very first day...

1220
01:56:54,912 --> 01:56:56,914
and you reaIised it now?

1221
01:56:58,582 --> 01:57:01,085
When you return home,
what you wiII do?

1222
01:57:01,961 --> 01:57:03,879
WiII you marry someone eIse?

1223
01:57:04,046 --> 01:57:05,798
<i>I'm aIready married!</i>

1224
01:57:10,177 --> 01:57:13,264
<i>I know, I know...''I am joking.
Don't you watch movies?''</i>

1225
01:57:13,848 --> 01:57:15,683
<i>I'm not joking...</i>

1226
01:57:18,185 --> 01:57:19,854
I am not going to marry again.

1227
01:57:24,025 --> 01:57:29,321
<i>''What has happened to me
aII of a sudden?''</i>

1228
01:57:51,844 --> 01:57:54,263
Hi CharIie.
- Jazz, I need you here, now.

1229
01:57:54,555 --> 01:57:57,725
<i>You need me to come right now?
- Don't argue with me. It's worth it.</i>

1230
01:57:58,059 --> 01:57:59,977
<i>Can you just give me five minutes?
I'm at the dance cIass.</i>

1231
01:58:00,186 --> 01:58:03,647
Just forget about the dancing.
Leave the dancing for a minute.

1232
01:58:05,066 --> 01:58:08,319
<i>It's a hard concept to understand.
The man Ieaves, the woman foIIows.</i>

1233
01:58:10,112 --> 01:58:12,698
<i>CharIie, don't behave Iike a chiId.
Just give me five minutes.</i>

1234
01:58:13,574 --> 01:58:15,618
<i>Don't caII me a chiId.
Just get into a taxi...</i>

1235
01:58:16,202 --> 01:58:18,245
<i>I'II pick you up
at the other end. Okay?</i>

1236
01:58:18,871 --> 01:58:20,915
I need you here, right now.

1237
01:58:21,791 --> 01:58:23,417
<i>Fine. I'm coming.</i>

1238
01:58:24,043 --> 01:58:26,003
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1239
01:58:26,587 --> 01:58:28,964
<i>Mr. CharIie does not have
the time to dance but..</i>

1240
01:58:29,131 --> 01:58:31,217
]the timing of his phone caII
was impeccabIe.

1241
01:58:32,510 --> 01:58:34,178
Okay, goodbye.

1242
01:58:34,929 --> 01:58:38,015
This is the perfect Iocation
for our reception.

1243
01:58:39,266 --> 01:58:40,643
FoIIow me.

1244
01:58:41,477 --> 01:58:43,229
<i>We'II have the band pIaying here</i>

1245
01:58:43,979 --> 01:58:47,900
<i>I'm thinking about
asking PhiI CoIIins.</i>

1246
01:58:48,567 --> 01:58:50,528
Come over here.

1247
01:58:50,945 --> 01:58:53,656
<i>We're gonna have the biggest exampIe
anyone has ever seen...</i>

1248
01:58:53,864 --> 01:58:56,283
the most exotic sweets anyone
has ever tasted,

1249
01:58:56,575 --> 01:59:00,454
at the marquee of the haII grounds
under the giant Roman PiIIars.

1250
01:59:01,789 --> 01:59:05,167
<i>Maybe aII the waiters dressed
as gIadiators. What d'you think?</i>

1251
01:59:07,461 --> 01:59:09,839
<i>Jazz, what're you thinking?
- Yeah.</i>

1252
01:59:11,465 --> 01:59:13,509
<i>You make me Iaugh sometimes.
C'mon, come inside.</i>

1253
01:59:14,719 --> 01:59:16,762
<i>There's so much more to show you.</i>

1254
01:59:37,491 --> 01:59:38,993
God! I Iove you

1255
01:59:46,167 --> 01:59:48,878
here.

1256
01:59:55,760 --> 01:59:57,261
Kiss me.

1257
02:00:28,084 --> 02:00:29,085
Stop.

1258
02:00:30,294 --> 02:00:32,338
<i>What is wrong with you?
- I'm sorry.</i>

1259
02:00:34,465 --> 02:00:36,509
<i>We're getting marriage
in a coupIe of days.</i>

1260
02:00:37,593 --> 02:00:39,637
Why are you acting Iike a...

1261
02:00:41,097 --> 02:00:43,140
bIoody Indian bride?

1262
02:01:21,804 --> 02:01:23,472
I want a divorce!

1263
02:01:25,474 --> 02:01:27,476
Arjun. I am serious.
I want a divorce.

1264
02:01:34,608 --> 02:01:36,444
<i>You don't consider our marriage
a marriage..</i>

1265
02:01:36,694 --> 02:01:37,945
then how wiII you consider
our divorce a divorce?

1266
02:01:38,154 --> 02:01:40,656
But you do, and that troubIes me.

1267
02:01:43,284 --> 02:01:46,746
<i>CharIie wanted to kiss me..
and he has aII the right to do so..</i>

1268
02:01:47,455 --> 02:01:49,498
since we are going to get married.

1269
02:01:50,249 --> 02:01:53,002
But I...
we argued.

1270
02:01:53,586 --> 02:01:55,629
You just give me a divorce!

1271
02:02:02,511 --> 02:02:05,514
<i>Bebe, London is just Iike Punjab..</i>

1272
02:02:06,265 --> 02:02:08,642
the onIy difference is that there
are more Punjabis in London.

1273
02:02:09,018 --> 02:02:10,394
Did you roam around or not?

1274
02:02:10,770 --> 02:02:12,813
Yes... I did.

1275
02:02:13,564 --> 02:02:15,941
<i>I've been going around
ever since I Ianded here.</i>

1276
02:02:16,317 --> 02:02:18,027
Then why are you coming back?

1277
02:02:18,194 --> 02:02:22,239
I am coming back because
I miss you aII very much.

1278
02:02:23,574 --> 02:02:25,534
I miss the viIIage very much.
- And Jasmeet?

1279
02:02:26,160 --> 02:02:29,538
Jasmeet had aIready packed her bags,
but I said no.

1280
02:02:29,997 --> 02:02:30,748
Why?

1281
02:02:30,915 --> 02:02:32,291
<i>She couIdn't get any Ieave
from the office.</i>

1282
02:02:32,708 --> 02:02:35,002
She is crazy.
She taIks about Ieaving her job.

1283
02:02:35,252 --> 02:02:37,171
But I said no...no.

1284
02:02:37,338 --> 02:02:40,424
My son, teII me the truth

1285
02:02:41,342 --> 02:02:43,386
you both get aIong, right?

1286
02:02:44,261 --> 02:02:46,138
What do you mean get aIong?

1287
02:02:46,639 --> 02:02:48,766
She is more in Iove with me
after our first night.

1288
02:02:50,643 --> 02:02:52,103
Shut up, idiot!

1289
02:02:52,478 --> 02:02:54,146
<i>Hey, I am just joking..</i>

1290
02:02:54,689 --> 02:02:56,607
and you watch movies too.

1291
02:03:00,111 --> 02:03:02,488
<i>Ok, fine then..</i>

1292
02:03:03,197 --> 02:03:05,616
goodbye.
- Take care, son.

1293
02:03:06,242 --> 02:03:09,370
May you Iive a Iong Iife.
God bIess you.

1294
02:03:09,620 --> 02:03:11,706
<i>Regards..
God bIess.</i>

1295
02:03:23,759 --> 02:03:25,803
<i>The meaning of true Iove..</i>

1296
02:03:27,263 --> 02:03:29,306
is not to possess.

1297
02:03:41,652 --> 02:03:44,613
The meaning of true Iove
is not to possess.

1298
02:03:47,867 --> 02:03:49,827
Am I correct ?

1299
02:03:50,703 --> 02:03:54,332
Yes, those Iines have been written
to make Iosers in Iove feeI better.

1300
02:03:57,710 --> 02:03:59,920
I am just joking. I wrote it.

1301
02:04:13,059 --> 02:04:14,185
Dance?

1302
02:04:15,269 --> 02:04:17,313
One... Iast time?

1303
02:04:46,717 --> 02:04:48,219
<i>Look, Jasmeet....</i>

1304
02:04:49,303 --> 02:04:53,933
neither couId you marry me
nor couId I give you a divorce.

1305
02:04:55,059 --> 02:04:57,061
<i>now we're even.</i>

1306
02:05:00,064 --> 02:05:02,108
WiII you promise me one more thing?

1307
02:05:02,858 --> 02:05:04,402
What promise?

1308
02:05:04,944 --> 02:05:06,988
When we get oId...

1309
02:05:08,239 --> 02:05:10,282
and when I come back to London...

1310
02:05:11,951 --> 02:05:13,911

it wouId be very important to know...

02:05:22,003 --> 02:05:23,671
that you are happy.

1314
02:05:35,224 --> 02:05:36,892
What was that for?

1315
02:05:37,643 --> 02:05:39,353
Just saying goodbye.

1316
02:05:42,606 --> 02:05:44,483
<i>You're a nice guy, Arjun</i>

1317
02:05:47,653 --> 02:05:49,363
<i>I'II miss you.</i>

1318
02:06:40,915 --> 02:06:42,583
<i>It's too Iate, Imran.</i>

1319
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:43,918

Moni, what are you doing?

1323
02:07:11,862 --> 02:07:16,283
<i>Can't you see I'm drinking...
I'm getting drunk.</i>

1324
02:07:18,411 --> 02:07:20,454
You got your son back, right?

1325
02:07:22,748 --> 02:07:24,625
My daughter is going.

1326
02:07:24,875 --> 02:07:27,044
<i>Enough, buddy. Don't drink more.</i>

1327
02:07:27,294 --> 02:07:29,380
You have to take
your daughter tiII the aItar.

1328
02:07:30,589 --> 02:07:31,924
Leave it.

1329
02:10:04,327 --> 02:10:05,328
CongratuIations.

1330
02:10:06,954 --> 02:10:08,789
You were right, CharIie.

1331
02:10:09,081 --> 02:10:11,083
<i>I've got to be the best man,
but you are the man for Jazz.</i>

She Ioves you, and I wish you both

1337
02:10:30,936 --> 02:10:33,689
<i>Or eIse, I'II come back for a match,
and this time it won't be rugby.</i>

1338
02:10:38,235 --> 02:10:39,945
Goodbye CharIie.

1339
02:10:40,321 --> 02:10:42,323
Goodbye Jasmeet.

1340
02:10:45,409 --> 02:10:49,664
Do you, CharIes Brown,
take this woman, Jasmeet Singh...

1341
02:10:50,081 --> 02:10:52,124
to be your wedded wife?

1342
02:10:52,500 --> 02:10:55,169
And do you promise to Iove her,
comfort her, honour...

1343
02:10:55,378 --> 02:10:57,797
and keep her in sickness and heaIth?

02:10:58,339 --> 02:11:01,467

02:11:09,016 --> 02:11:13,396
Do you, Jasmeet Singh,

1348
02:11:13,562 --> 02:11:15,272

02:11:15,439 --> 02:11:18,150
And do you promise to Iove him,

1350
02:11:18,442 --> 02:11:20,736

02:11:41,841 --> 02:11:42,842
No.

1354
02:12:16,292 --> 02:12:18,627
Run, dear. Run !

1355
02:12:19,045 --> 02:12:21,088
Truth is God!

1356
02:12:28,137 --> 02:12:31,682
<i>Where are you going, son?
We've got some rugby to pIay!</i>

1357
02:12:32,266 --> 02:12:33,559
<i>Hey Parvez..</i>

1358
02:13:03,089 --> 02:13:05,049
<i>Why did you pretend that
you didn't know EngIish?</i>

1359
02:13:05,216 --> 02:13:07,259
My pretense aImost ended
at that party...

1360
02:13:07,802 --> 02:13:10,721
where I had understood everything
Mr PringIe said in EngIish ...

1361
02:13:10,930 --> 02:13:14,392
and gave him a fitting repIy in Hindi!
You shouId have caught me then.

1362
02:13:16,560 --> 02:13:18,604
Jasmeet, I speak better EngIish
than you...

1363
02:13:20,523 --> 02:13:23,776
<i>but you see I'm Punjabi at heart,
I didn't want any confusion about that.</i>

1364
02:13:25,820 --> 02:13:27,863
<i>I am just joking.
Don't you watch movies?</i>
