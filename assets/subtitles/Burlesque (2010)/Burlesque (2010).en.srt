1,350 --> 00:02:34,150
BURLESQUE

1
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:32,396
Sixteen-fifty for you, 16:50 for me.

2
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:39,836
Loretta, I'm leaving.

3
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:41,337
What do you mean?

4
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:43,504
Soon as I get my check, I'm gone.

5
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:46,904
I'll be back.

6
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,447
- Dwight, I need my check.
- Payday's at the end of the month.

7
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:54,246
Haven't paid us for last month.
I need money, Loretta's got a kid-

8
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:57,618
Problem with management?
Put a note in the suggestion box.

9
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:01,482
- I'm serious. I'm quitting.
- I'll be back for the dinner shift.

10
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,461
I sure as hell won't be.

11
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:10,260
What are you doing?

12
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:12,871
I'm taking what he owes me,
not a penny more.

13
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:15,530
You take that money,
he's gonna come after you.

14
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:18,469
- Gotta find me first.
- What you gonna do?

15
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:22,279
This ought to cover that bike
for little Keith.

16
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:24,212
You're late to pick him up.

17
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:26,610
Go. I got everything covered here.

18
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:27,980
You're really going?

19
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:29,712
I'm really going.

20
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:34,125
That bike can wait till Christmas.

21
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:37,559
You keep what he owes you.
I'll deal with Dwight, okay?

22
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:41,732
See you later.

23
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:18,428
How much to Los Angeles?

24
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:21,123
- One-way or round-trip?
- You're kidding, right?

25
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:11,000
Hey, Coco. Coco Puff, you're on.
Come on. You're on, you're on.

26
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:54,811
We may not have windows...

27
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,615
...but we do have the best view
on Sunset Strip.

28
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:01,677
Twenty bucks.

29
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,952
What is this place, a strip club?

30
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:05,147
"Strip club"?

31
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:08,386
I should wash your mouth out
with J? Germeister.

32
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:11,992
The only Pole you'll find in there
is Natasha, the shot girl.

33
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:23,068
Baby cakes, I got a club to fill here.

34
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:25,567
Right, sorry.

35
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:33,876
Enjoy.

36
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,699
Show a little more

37
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:51,860
Show a little less

38
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,240
Add a little smoke

39
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:59,037
Welcome to Burlesque

40
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,913
Everything you dream of

41
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:05,946
But never can possess

42
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:10,021
Nothing's what it seems

43
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:13,517
Welcome to Burlesque

44
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:18,928
Everyone is buying

45
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:21,999
Put your money in my hand

46
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:25,960
If you got a little extra

47
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:28,265
Well, give it to the band

48
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:37,772
You may not be guilty

49
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:41,319
But you're ready to confess

50
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,085
Tell me what you need

51
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:49,589
Welcome to Burlesque

52
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:52,656
You can dream of Coco

53
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:55,832
Do it at your risk

54
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:58,929
The triplets grant you mercy

55
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:02,467
But not your every wish

56
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:06,945
Jesse keeps you guessing

57
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:10,277
So cool and statuesque

58
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,851
"Behave yourself," says Georgia

59
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:16,648
Welcome to Burlesque

60
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,995
Everyone is buying

61
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:29,259
Put your money in my hand

62
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:33,299
If you want a little extra

63
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:35,497
Well, you know where I am

64
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:38,105
Something very dark

65
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:41,940
Is playing with your mind

66
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,049
It's not the end of days

67
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:48,447
It's just the bump and grind

68
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:51,990
Show a little more

69
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,184
Show a little less

70
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:58,692
Add a little smoke

71
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:09,835
Welcome to Burlesque

72
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:28,026
- Can I get you a drink?
- Only if you're buying.

73
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:30,856
- Welcome to L.A.
- Thank you.

74
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,554
- Where you from?
- Iowa.

75
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:36,628
- Kentucky. We're practically related.
- Thought you looked familiar.

76
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:49,409
Hey, sweetheart?
You wanna do your job? Let's go.

77
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:56,619
Who does a girl have to flirt with
to get from here to up there?

78
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,347
Is this you flirting?

79
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:02,250
With someone wearing more eyeliner
than me? Yeah.

80
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,089
Through that door over there.

81
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:05,753
Ask for Tess.

82
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:08,263
- She's your guy. Flirt away.
- Thanks.

83
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:09,765
- Iowa.
- Yeah?

84
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:11,129
Use my name.

85
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:13,533
Thanks, Jack.

86
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:18,569
Hold it! Hold it. That's good.

87
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:21,304
We're on in five minutes.
Five minutes, ladies.

88
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,472
- Get over there.
- All right, I'm coming.

89
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,311
Ladies! Let's move it, ladies!

90
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:28,453
Does anyone know where Nikki is?

91
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:31,815
Both spotlights are
supposed to pull in.

92
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,389
Georgia, your boyfriend is so cute.

93
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,461
So tonight, takeout and a movie?

94
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,654
Both.

95
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:40,560
- Casablanca and Oreos.
- Yes.

96
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,564
Tess! I lost a contact on the stage.

97
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:46,830
Okay, if you fall off the stage,
leg extended, boobs up.

98
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,906
Remember, you're a goddess.

99
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,804
- Thank you, Sean.
- You're welcome.

100
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:52,671
"Thank you, Sean."

101
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:54,210
Come here, give me.

102
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,904
- Wait.
- What? The foot?

103
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:58,312
Yeah, the foot, the back, the neck.

104
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:01,248
The hips, the breasts, the face...

105
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:04,649
Vince, the sink's busted
upstairs again.

106
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,951
I'm not calling a plumber, Coco.

107
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,827
Tess, have you read this letter
from the bank?

108
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:14,454
How many times have I told you?
No business during business hours.

109
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:17,625
- Marcus Gerber is coming in tonight.
- So what?

110
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:19,532
This isn't going away.

111
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:22,765
You won't talk to me before the show,
after the show.

112
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,500
It's like you're avoiding me.

113
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:27,202
I didn't divorce you
to spend more time with you.

114
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:31,110
I may not be "Mr. Tess" anymore,
but I still own half this place.

115
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:32,784
"Mr. Tess."

116
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:34,616
That is so hot.

117
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,585
Nice, but it won't pay the bills.

118
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,681
Wait. Wait. Zip me up.

119
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,457
Excuse me, I'm looking for Tess.

120
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:47,863
Hi, are you Tess?

121
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:50,631
And you are in my mirror because?

122
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,333
Oh, sorry. I'm friends with Jack,
and I'm looking for a job.

123
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,373
And where have you danced?

124
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:59,033
At home, mostly. But I can move.

125
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:01,771
Okay, give your name
and number to Sean.

126
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,245
Let you know
when we're having our audition.

127
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,050
When will that be, exactly?

128
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:07,577
Sean?

129
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:11,052
- Where the hell is Nikki?
- I don't know. She's late again.

130
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:13,088
Oh, I'm never late. Ever.

131
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:14,283
That's great.

132
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,691
We're trying to put on a show here.
Come back another time.

133
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:19,831
I've never seen anything like this.

134
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:23,594
- I need a job. I wanna work here.
- Great enthusiasm, terrible timing.

135
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:27,432
So leave your name and your number
with Jack, your friend downstairs.

136
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,835
And we'll call you. Okay? Promise.

137
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:33,568
Hey, can you fix this for me?

138
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,373
Let's move it, ladies!

139
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,708
- Hello.
- Oh, my God. Nikki.

140
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:42,947
You're probably not
gonna believe this...

141
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:45,556
...but Sean and I were talking,
and he said...

142
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:50,184
I said, "It's so sad that Nikki couldn't
join us for the opening number...

143
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:53,729
...but it would be so great
if she joined us for the next one."

144
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,431
Paws and claws.
Took longer than I thought.

145
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:59,764
So is finding a new job
when I fire you.

146
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:01,065
Yeah, right.

147
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:02,599
- Get ready.
- Yeah.

148
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:04,910
Hey. Bring me a martini.

149
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:07,068
Extra dry, straight up, three olives.

150
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:09,612
- And hurry back.
- She doesn't work here.

151
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,044
Then she's not busy.

152
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,780
Twenty minutes and we're back.

153
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:19,424
Your mama tell you
it's not polite to stare?

154
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:22,090
You're just so damn beautiful, I-

155
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:25,930
Well, in that case, screw your mama
and stare away.

156
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:27,998
No one would ever know.

157
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,258
Know what?

158
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:30,493
That you're a dude.

159
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:34,262
- God.
- Can I use this?

160
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:37,770
Goddamn it! Don't touch my stuff!

161
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:39,976
Hey, waitress!

162
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:42,039
Sweetheart? Hey, over here.

163
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,238
One second.

164
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,716
Yo!

165
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,854
- Ladies?
- I'll have a vodka.

166
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:57,852
What can I get you?

167
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,295
One shot of Patrón...

168
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:07,132
...and tough guy with the hat
over there, he wants a Cosmo.

169
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,534
- What are you doing?
- One night.

170
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:13,166
If I'm not better than boobs-for-brains,
you don't have to pay me.

171
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,143
Isn't that the girl
that was backstage?

172
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,136
I think so.

173
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:51,181
Hey, Jack, what's she doing here?

174
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,317
She really wanted a job.

175
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:56,613
And so she is our new waitress.

176
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,519
And when did I make you
head of personnel?

177
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:02,387
She just picked up a tray,
started working.

178
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:05,026
- Really?
- Well, her name is Ali.

179
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:06,723
Ali.

180
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:08,532
Hey, Ali.

181
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,867
Look, this is cute, but come on.

182
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,871
Push up those boobs.
Got them, show them. Work them.

183
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,968
And don't ever
go behind my back again.

184
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:24,347
- Yes, ma'am.
- And don't ever call me ma'am again.

185
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:27,451
- Yes, sir. I mean ma'am. I mean Tess.
- Get on the floor.

186
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,117
"Ma'am"?

187
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,781
What am I, my mother?

188
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:35,119
Yes, ma'am.

189
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:36,522
Up yours.

190
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:57,773
Excuse me.

191
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:01,147
Dewar's rocks and a bottle
of your best champagne.

192
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,686
Oh, and will you tell Nikki
that I'm here?

193
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,016
And you are...?

194
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,384
A member since '91.

195
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:09,991
Marcus Gerber. And you are?

196
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:12,528
- Ali.
- Ali.

197
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,961
I'm here.

198
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:18,163
You're late, you're late
for a very important date.

199
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:19,634
Georgia went on for you.

200
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:28,743
What is that waitress doing here?
I want that bitch out now.

201
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:30,437
What did she ever do to you?

202
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:34,052
- She told me I look like a drag queen.
- Can't be the first time.

203
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:36,247
Get my spot.

204
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:38,949
Nikki, what are you doing?

205
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:01,630
Hey!

206
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:06,169
Ali. Ali.

207
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:09,410
Ali. Ali. What do you need?

208
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:11,242
Dewar's rocks, bottle of Dom-

209
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,644
And keep it coming.

210
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,843
Yep. So he's a regular, huh?

211
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:17,351
Marcus Gerber, real estate guy.

212
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,319
Dating Nikki. This week at least.

213
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:28,290
I wanna be up there.
I wanna do that.

214
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,094
Question is...

215
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,032
- ... do you have the talent?
- I do.

216
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:33,501
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

217
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:34,764
- Positive?
- Yeah.

218
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,635
Good, because you're on.

219
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:09,740
I got a dentist

220
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:15,736
Who's over seven feet tall

221
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:21,915
Ooh, I've got a dentist, baby

222
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:28,253
The man is over seven feet tall

223
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:35,156
His name is Dr. Long John

224
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,365
And he answers

225
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:43,402
Every call

226
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,246
It's simple.

227
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,615
I assume all
your financial obligations...

228
00:20:57,956 --> 00:20:59,253
...buy you out...

229
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,722
...pay you a million
right off the top.

230
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:02,985
Five hundred each.

231
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:08,556
Where is the partnership that-? You
said there was gonna be a partnership.

232
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:10,263
How about a partnership?

233
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:14,030
Partnerships don't really
work so well with me.

234
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:16,970
- And that deal is-
- Very generous.

235
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:20,134
Good. Because I lead
with my final offer.

236
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:24,180
Not that I give a shit, but why is it
that you want my club so badly?

237
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:26,010
I like it.

238
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:29,548
I see something I like,
I have to have it. Since I was a kid.

239
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:32,588
That must have made you
very popular in the sandbox.

240
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:36,253
I did okay.

241
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:38,328
You know what you could
do with that?

242
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,761
You know what you could
do with that money?

243
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:42,490
- Not now.
- Don't "not now" me.

244
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,225
The way I see it...

245
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:48,072
...you're in a fix
and I'm in a position to help.

246
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,676
We play this thing right,
and we all come out winners.

247
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:52,867
Yeah.

248
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:55,809
You got that balloon payment
due on the first.

249
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,472
Did you also tell him
I have a tattoo on my ass?

250
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,011
No. It's business.

251
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:05,020
I don't think you're gonna get
another opportunity like this.

252
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:08,590
So take it.

253
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:23,468
- No.
- She means not now.

254
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,872
No, no.
"Not now" means not now, Vince.

255
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:28,444
No means no.

256
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:31,780
Marcus, I don't care
what you're offering.

257
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,815
My club is not for sale.

258
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:37,184
Well, offer's on the table.

259
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,314
Thanks.

260
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:46,992
See you in the sandbox.

261
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,092
Wendy! Do you have my makeup?

262
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:26,528
Drinks, ladies.

263
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:30,869
All right, white wine.

264
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:32,202
Tom Collins.

265
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:34,277
Which one is Nikki's?

266
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,209
- Both.
- Shit.

267
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,577
That was my shot.

268
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:42,553
Here's mud in your eye, Nik.

269
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:52,959
All right. Now I got a buzz,
and you gotta change. You're on.

270
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:55,261
What are you, my mother?

271
00:23:57,202 --> 00:24:00,194
In case you haven't noticed,
Vince was talking to Marcus.

272
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:03,239
Well, that's because Marcus
is trying to buy my club.

273
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,003
Mother of God.

274
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,071
Tess? Probably not a good time.

275
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:10,214
I know you're busy
and I don't mean to interrupt.

276
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:13,442
Hey! Did anybody talk to Dave about
the new vocals?

277
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,677
That's what I've been
thinking about.

278
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:18,419
- All the girls lip-synch-
- Except for Tess.

279
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,818
Except for Tess.

280
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:24,087
But wouldn't it be great if we
actually heard the girls sing?

281
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:25,820
No. It wouldn't be great.

282
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:27,021
Honey.

283
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:29,599
People come here
to watch the dancers dance...

284
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:33,761
...and to watch them lip-synch
to the great singers.

285
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:35,099
I hear you. I get it.

286
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:37,673
I'm just thinking
of ways to make it better.

287
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:39,867
I don't understand why we can't try-

288
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:42,912
You don't understand
because it's above your pay grade.

289
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:47,082
I don't get what that means.
Hear me out. This is a good idea-

290
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,516
Ali, Ali, no- No. No. No.

291
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:51,519
Stop. Take her and remove her.

292
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,282
Okay, let's go. Come on.

293
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:56,188
They need you on the floor,
but thanks for visiting.

294
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:59,793
All right. Oh, this is not for anybody.

295
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,632
You look so beautiful right now.
I can't even tell you.

296
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:07,601
And you are so full of shit.

297
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,286
Goddamn it!

298
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:44,132
Ali?

299
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:51,808
You can just have a seat.

300
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:54,916
I'm gonna grab us
both a drink, yeah?

301
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:58,916
Oh, and here.

302
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,580
Call whoever you want.

303
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:02,656
Long distance, whatever.

304
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:06,490
- I can't.
- What do you mean?

305
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:07,990
I don't have anyone.

306
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:13,831
No parents or siblings,
aunts, uncles, anyone?

307
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:15,029
No one.

308
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:21,009
So you're not here to use my phone.

309
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:24,208
No, no, stop.
It's gonna be all right.

310
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,376
You can crash here.

311
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:32,284
Just please, please, stop crying.

312
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,918
Okay. Okay.

313
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:38,622
I'll take that.

314
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,394
Better?

315
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:47,936
Good.

316
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,037
Just one night.

317
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:53,075
Till it's light out and I can
figure out my next move.

318
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:55,236
Deal.

319
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,454
That's beautiful.

320
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,387
Who wrote that?

321
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:14,290
I did.

322
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,728
You wrote that?

323
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,994
Jack, that's... That's really good.

324
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:22,070
Thank you.

325
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:24,766
- You have more?
- Yeah.

326
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:28,344
Nothing that's ready to be heard.

327
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,778
Hey, Jack...

328
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:32,708
...why did you leave Kentucky?

329
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:35,813
Why did you leave Iowa?

330
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:42,255
Because I looked around
and realized...

331
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:46,855
...there wasn't one person
whose life I wanted.

332
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:48,056
Exactly.

333
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,359
Hey, Jack.

334
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:56,430
I'm really glad I don't have to
be alone tonight.

335
00:27:58,076 --> 00:27:59,134
Get some sleep.

336
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:12,649
Morning.

337
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:14,815
- Coffee?
- Black.

338
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:17,952
Like my soul.

339
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:20,689
I took the liberty
of making breakfast.

340
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,698
I hope you don't mind.
It's the least I could do.

341
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,096
Smells great.

342
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,270
She's pretty. Your sister?

343
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:29,373
- Fiancée.
- You're straight?

344
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:31,973
- You thought I was gay?
- Yeah.

345
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:34,907
- Wait, why?
- I don't know. The day bed, eyeliner.

346
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:36,740
It's a very straight look.

347
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:39,349
You know, it works at the club,
Tess loves it-

348
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:40,779
Okay.

349
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:42,585
I should put on some pants.

350
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:44,016
Probably.

351
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:46,180
So where is she, this fiancée?

352
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:48,154
She's in New York doing a play.

353
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:50,954
Now that you're straight
and engaged...

354
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:54,030
...I feel really weird I came here
in the first place.

355
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,129
I'm all right.

356
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:01,636
- I'll be out of your hair in no time.
- You don't have to leave.

357
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:04,331
- Don't worry about me.
- It's pouring outside.

358
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:08,476
I got a plan.
If you could just get the door for me.

359
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:12,373
Thank you.

360
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,916
- You're welcome.
- See you at the club.

361
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:47,344
Ali! What are you doing?

362
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:48,917
Come back inside!

363
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:50,748
No, Jack, I'm fine.

364
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:52,150
It's pouring.

365
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:54,655
It's just water, for chrissake.

366
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:56,217
Damn it.

367
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,562
Get your ass back in my house.

368
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,698
You've done enough. I'm fine.

369
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:04,966
All right, all right, fine. Here we go.

370
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,104
Put me down. What are you doing?

371
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:09,763
You have nowhere to go
and I have a couch.

372
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:12,409
Like it or not, you're gonna stay.

373
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:19,643
Hey, Natalie.

374
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:23,544
Really? That's great.

375
00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:39,827
Georgia?

376
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:41,965
Yeah.

377
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:48,245
Oh, God, please don't have the flu.

378
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:52,372
Oh, God.

379
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,617
Please have the flu.

380
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:00,816
Why do they call it
morning sickness...

381
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:03,893
...if it hits you at every fricking
moment of the day?

382
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:05,324
Have you told Damon yet?

383
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:07,264
No, not yet.

384
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:11,700
Well, sweetheart, you know,
at some point he's going to notice.

385
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,030
He's a guy.

386
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:16,662
He's not gonna notice
until my belly's blocking the TV.

387
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:19,102
Well, what are you gonna do?

388
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:22,410
I don't know, Tess.
I'm really scared.

389
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,810
Oh, honey, don't be scared.

390
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:29,044
Whatever you decide,
we will take care of you. Okay?

391
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,915
But you've got to tell Damon.

392
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:33,080
I figured as long
as he doesn't know...

393
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:36,256
...I can still pretend he's gonna be
excited about it.

394
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:39,954
He's gonna be thrilled.
Are you kidding? He'll be thrilled.

395
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,241
Excellent. That was great.

396
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,543
Thank you very much, ladies.

397
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:07,447
What happened to
all the great dancers in L.A.?

398
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:09,422
They're dancing with the stars.

399
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,824
Call Andre and ask.
He might have somebody.

400
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:13,020
Okay.

401
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:15,298
Don't like her, I don't like her.

402
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:17,866
I don't love any of them.
She's the best one.

403
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:19,401
What is that?

404
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,770
What is she doing?

405
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,469
I think she's auditioning.

406
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:32,879
Hey, Dave, cut it!

407
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:37,919
Hold on a second, I can do this.

408
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:40,683
And I think it's sweet
that you think you can.

409
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:44,555
- Tell me what you're looking for.
- Someone who can do the routine.

410
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:48,798
Excuse me? I'm talking to you!

411
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:51,525
Oh, shit.

412
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:53,527
Just tell me what you want.

413
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,303
I can't tell you.

414
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,065
Nobody can tell you.

415
00:32:57,275 --> 00:33:00,142
You gotta make me believe
that you belong up there.

416
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:03,803
That you own that stage and that
nobody's gonna take it from you.

417
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:05,611
That's the way it works.

418
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:08,581
You wanna show me something,
show me that.

419
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:10,611
All right.

420
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:13,382
Which number do you wanna see?
I know everyone.

421
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:16,118
- Every number?
- Which one do you wanna see?

422
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:20,290
"Wagon Wheel Watusi."

423
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:35,806
What's going on?

424
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:40,910
Well, I couldn't keep
my eyes off her.

425
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:42,944
Try harder.

426
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:45,806
You were off the whole last half.

427
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:50,352
Come on, Tess. Come on, I'll practice
till I bleed. I know I can do this.

428
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:52,489
You know, we have better dancers.

429
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:54,955
Then say thank you very much
and goodbye.

430
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:58,391
If you just give me a chance.
I swear I won't disappoint you.

431
00:34:58,563 --> 00:35:00,463
Didn't anybody ever
give you a shot?

432
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:02,223
Please, I want this so bad.

433
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,801
- If you just give me a chance, I'd-
- All right. God!

434
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:07,163
You got the job.

435
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:13,772
What are you so excited about?
She's your replacement.

436
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:17,070
Thank you, Tess.
You won't regret it.

437
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:19,676
I am so gonna regret this.

438
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:26,580
What is Ali short for?

439
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:28,748
- Alice.
- Alice?

440
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,553
Well, welcome to Wonderland.

441
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,930
Meet me upstairs in five.

442
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:42,762
Well, sorry for the short notice...

443
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:44,732
...but I quit.

444
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,104
It's okay.

445
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:50,509
And with my new raise,
I will be off your couch in no time.

446
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:00,117
Here we go.

447
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:02,020
Black corset, first number.

448
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:04,991
Second number, "Wagon Wheel,"
that's that.

449
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,631
Swarovski bustier,
that's for the third number.

450
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:10,699
And this is for "Miss Otis Regrets."

451
00:36:10,868 --> 00:36:13,268
And remember, with that, don't...

452
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,631
...pull the trigger.

453
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:07,553
You like her. I know it kills you,
but you have to admit it.

454
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:10,694
No. You know, she pulls focus,
she doesn't blend in.

455
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:12,590
A girl that doesn't blend in?

456
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:14,025
Oh, my.

457
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:16,132
That is so beneath you.

458
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:19,828
Here we go, here we go.
Don't lose those again.

459
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:21,198
How you doing?

460
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:24,864
My boobs are pushed up to my ears,
my thong's a mile up my butt...

461
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:28,534
...and my eyelashes are so thick
they could kick up a stiff wind.

462
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,949
Fun being a girl, isn't it?
Come on, let's go, let's go.

463
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:37,717
- You guys wanna go grab pizza?
- Yes, please.

464
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:40,553
- Yeah.
- I'm starving.

465
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:41,783
Good, let's go.

466
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:43,426
My day was so long.

467
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:46,923
Ice cream sounds so good.

468
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:49,060
That's so bad.

469
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:53,232
- I'm gonna get so full tonight.
- What?

470
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:25,135
Where is everybody?

471
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,498
They went out for pizza.

472
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:29,833
I wasn't hungry.

473
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:37,203
That brush isn't working.
It's too old.

474
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:39,281
Well, it's the only brush I have.

475
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:42,518
I'll let you use mine.

476
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:49,052
- Here.
- Thanks.

477
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:54,520
All right, here. Let me help you.

478
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:58,331
Wet it if you're gonna get
a clean line.

479
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:01,004
Close your eyes.

480
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:04,039
When you are putting on
your makeup...

481
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,738
...it's like you're an artist.

482
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:09,277
But instead of painting
on a canvas...

483
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:11,878
...you're painting your face.

484
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:17,379
My mom was a model
and she was beautiful.

485
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:18,954
Tall, blond.

486
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:20,717
Not like me.

487
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:24,761
Body that could stop a truck.

488
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:29,764
And she had these girlfriends,
beautiful girls, Colleen and Shirley...

489
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:32,698
...and they would come over
in the morning...

490
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:36,772
...and put their makeup on together
before they went on jobs. Up.

491
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:39,933
We had a window in the back
of our house with a ledge...

492
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:44,912
...and they would put their mirrors
side by side and put out their makeup.

493
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:48,916
They had lipsticks and blushes,
and it was fabulous.

494
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:53,853
I kept thinking, "God, I cannot wait
till I get old enough to play with this."

495
00:39:58,195 --> 00:40:01,187
Didn't you ever watch your mom
put on her makeup?

496
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:07,232
My mom died when I was 7...

497
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:10,002
...and it's my first lesson.

498
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:20,982
You know,
you won't be the new girl forever.

499
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:43,504
Beautiful.

500
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:52,446
Shit.

501
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:54,913
Ali.

502
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,686
Ali. Did you use my towel again?

503
00:40:57,855 --> 00:40:59,823
I found it soaking wet on the floor.

504
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:02,584
- I don't know. Maybe.
- How's that apartment hunt?

505
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:07,758
I've been looking.
Everything's over 1000 bucks a month.

506
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:10,924
How can you put a price
on privacy like that? Freedom?

507
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:13,001
Your own bathroom? Clean towels?

508
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,228
Okay, I get it.

509
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,807
It's Natalie.

510
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:22,603
Hey, babe.

511
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:30,419
Oh, hey.
What about Beachwood Canyon?

512
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,148
Great.

513
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:35,619
If you have a car.

514
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:38,992
I mean, truth is...

515
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,654
...you really should get a car first.

516
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:45,763
I mean, this is L.A. after all.
You know?

517
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:49,234
I'll tell you what.

518
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:51,674
I'm gonna suck it up...

519
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,969
...and let you stay a little bit longer.

520
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:56,437
Throw in something for rent,
we're good.

521
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:59,947
- A second ago you wanted me out.
- I don't like my towel wet.

522
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:02,745
I don't like the lack of privacy...

523
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:04,481
...but you're in a jam.

524
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:06,020
And I'm the kind of guy...

525
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:09,091
...when a friend is in trouble, I help.

526
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,420
It's just who I am.

527
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:12,826
What did Natalie have to say?

528
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:16,797
Nothing. No, she...
What did she say?

529
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:18,429
"Hi." That was it.

530
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:21,070
- And?
- And...

531
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:23,172
Her play got extended
three months.

532
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,604
She has to pay
everything there in rent...

533
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:27,744
...so I have to cover
everything here.

534
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:30,710
So if you wanna stick around
and chip in, it would-

535
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,314
- Save your ass?
- Help.

536
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:36,450
Well, will you look at that?

537
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:39,114
The shoe on the other foot.

538
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:41,121
One minute I'm a freeloader...

539
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:42,884
...and the next...

540
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,655
...I'm the only thing standing
between you and eviction.

541
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,525
Just yes or no?

542
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:51,630
What's the proposal exactly?

543
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:55,471
Wonderful apartment.
Bathroom included.

544
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:56,663
I'm listening.

545
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,535
- Use of the kitchen.
- Keep going.

546
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:00,677
- Six hundred a month.
- Closet?

547
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:02,334
- Half.
- Oh, look.

548
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:07,044
"Fabulous apartment
with a great view."

549
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:08,616
Fine, fine.

550
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,143
The whole closet.

551
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:12,050
- I want the bedroom.
- No way.

552
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:14,213
Oh, look. "Hot tub, Beverly Hills."

553
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:16,450
All right. You can have my bedroom.

554
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:17,954
Are you in?

555
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:19,286
Oh, Jack.

556
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:22,057
See, I'm the kind of girl...

557
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:25,099
...if a friend's in trouble, I help.

558
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,567
That's just who I am.

559
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,974
Oh, boy.

560
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:42,179
Your dream is killing me!

561
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:44,048
It's killing me!

562
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,361
What was that?

563
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:07,469
And what's this?

564
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:10,475
It's something about
the two mortgages.

565
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:15,414
To be perfectly honest,
I haven't got a goddamn clue.

566
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:18,216
But if I can't raise
the amount of money...

567
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:21,517
...on that paper by the end
of this month, I lose the club.

568
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:24,827
It's just money.

569
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,189
It's just a number.

570
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:28,296
I know...

571
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:31,030
...but do you think I could do it?

572
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:35,296
Okay, tell me a lie.

573
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:38,497
I need your expert sewing skills.

574
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:41,143
Tell me a new lie.

575
00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:44,842
I don't love you.

576
00:44:53,657 --> 00:44:56,182
Come here. Come here.

577
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:01,395
It's okay.

578
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:15,341
Stage right.

579
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:22,380
Wait a minute. Hey, hey.
What's in that?

580
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:23,577
Iced tea.

581
00:45:24,588 --> 00:45:26,453
Iced tea, my ass. Go home.

582
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:28,625
Yeah, right. I'm about to go on.

583
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:30,555
You're not gonna go on. Go home.

584
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:33,561
Relax. It is one drink.
What is the big deal?

585
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:36,131
Ali, you're gonna take Nikki's spot.

586
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,791
- She can't dance my part.
- She can and she will.

587
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:41,870
No, no. My God, I can't do that.
It is Nikki's number.

588
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:44,007
You said you can do
any number, right?

589
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:46,506
- I don't wanna step on any toes.
- Then don't.

590
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:48,076
I don't ca- Listen to me.

591
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,971
You're gonna go on,
and you're gonna go home.

592
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:54,744
Here, put this on.

593
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:00,254
Dave.

594
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,619
Tess wants to see you.
Says it's urgent.

595
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:04,283
I can't leave. I'm working.

596
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:06,258
Don't say I didn't warn you.

597
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,658
Shit.

598
00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:10,458
Everybody wants Dave
to do something.

599
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:14,001
Y'all gonna have me singing
by the time I'm done here. Jesus.

600
00:46:48,272 --> 00:46:49,330
Tess, what's up?

601
00:46:49,506 --> 00:46:51,030
What are you doing back here?

602
00:46:51,241 --> 00:46:54,472
- Nikki said you were looking for me.
- Nikki? What is going on?

603
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,112
Lower the curtain. Let's go.

604
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:02,816
Bye. Thanks for coming.

605
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:15,021
Hold it.

606
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:32,646
Raise the curtain.

607
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:46,114
Oh, my God.

608
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:52,019
Am I the only one that has no idea
what just happened?

609
00:49:52,189 --> 00:49:53,451
Whatever it was-

610
00:49:53,623 --> 00:49:55,887
The music stopped,
I didn't know what to do.

611
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:57,526
I had to sing, I'm sorry.

612
00:49:57,794 --> 00:49:59,853
Never told me
you could sing like that.

613
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:01,258
I tried to tell you.

614
00:50:01,431 --> 00:50:02,728
Okay, okay, all right.

615
00:50:02,899 --> 00:50:05,766
This is what we're gonna do.
You know the songs, right?

616
00:50:05,936 --> 00:50:06,960
Oh, yeah.

617
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:10,368
So tomorrow we're gonna rehearse,
then you're gonna sing.

618
00:50:10,707 --> 00:50:13,198
We're gonna go
straight through the show live.

619
00:50:13,377 --> 00:50:15,038
- So any questions?
- No.

620
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:17,271
Okay, good. Good.
You go with the guys.

621
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:20,177
Find out what keys
you're comfortable singing in...

622
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:24,719
...and I'm going to go up to my office
and plan an entirely new show.

623
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:28,922
- Okay?
- Oh, my God.

624
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:30,751
Thanks, Tess.

625
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:33,122
I'm gonna build a show around her.

626
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:36,322
"They don't come to hear us sing"?

627
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:39,498
They'll come to hear her sing.

628
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:48,100
So how do you feel?

629
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:52,405
- Amazing.
- I've never seen anything like that.

630
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:56,144
Thanks. Are you sure Tess
really liked it? She wasn't...?

631
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,715
I was bringing down the curtain.

632
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:01,357
She stopped me.
She's the one who let you sing.

633
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:04,726
- Really?
- She wants to build a show around you.

634
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:08,063
You're crying with happiness, right?

635
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:09,255
Good. Okay.

636
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:10,957
Brava.

637
00:51:16,506 --> 00:51:19,907
Clearly one of us
has underestimated the other.

638
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:31,586
I can't believe Tess has you
buried in the kick line.

639
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:32,949
She didn't know I sang.

640
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:34,920
Well, you certainly can.

641
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:37,783
And you are way too good
to be doing it here.

642
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:39,489
How about a drink?

643
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:41,221
The bar's right over there.

644
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:42,558
Tell Jack I sent you.

645
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:50,802
Where the hell did that come from?

646
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:53,799
- Who knew that you could do that?
- Thanks, Jack.

647
00:51:53,977 --> 00:51:56,377
Who knew any white chick
could sing like that?

648
00:51:56,546 --> 00:51:57,979
How do you do that?

649
00:51:58,148 --> 00:52:01,515
I don't know. It just happens.
I just do it.

650
00:52:01,685 --> 00:52:04,848
I know how that feels.
I gotta pee again, so...

651
00:52:05,755 --> 00:52:06,779
Stop.

652
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:08,986
We're gonna get something to eat.

653
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:10,483
You wanna come?

654
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:16,325
Yeah, I would.

655
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:18,829
Let's go.

656
00:52:19,402 --> 00:52:20,960
Look at you.

657
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:23,432
What? What?

658
00:52:23,607 --> 00:52:26,667
Well, no, just the way
you're gazing after her.

659
00:52:26,843 --> 00:52:28,743
I have a fiancée, remember?

660
00:52:28,945 --> 00:52:31,743
Yes. No, I do. I know.
Three thousand miles away.

661
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:32,939
We talk every day.

662
00:52:33,116 --> 00:52:34,708
You do? About what?

663
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:36,477
Let me guess, don't tell me.

664
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:38,416
About her.

665
00:52:40,123 --> 00:52:41,147
Her.

666
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:43,288
And, I don't know...

667
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:44,854
Her.

668
00:52:45,028 --> 00:52:47,519
AII I'm saying is that
that one there...

669
00:52:47,697 --> 00:52:50,359
...is beautiful
on the inside as well...

670
00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:52,968
...and she's not going to be
available forever.

671
00:52:53,303 --> 00:52:56,272
Relationship advice from
Mr. One-Night-Stand himself.

672
00:52:56,439 --> 00:52:57,463
That is...

673
00:52:57,641 --> 00:52:58,665
Forgot my purse.

674
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:04,010
- What?
- Oh, no.

675
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:07,810
I was just telling Jack here
how every opportunity has a shelf life.

676
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,444
Come here.

677
00:53:12,822 --> 00:53:14,050
Look there.

678
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:17,585
Awfully pretty, but too much.

679
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:20,855
See, I like that.

680
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:24,231
No, I'm not cutting my hair.

681
00:53:24,401 --> 00:53:28,201
Who said anything about you
cutting your hair? You can wear a wig.

682
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:30,236
I'm wearing one right now.

683
00:53:35,345 --> 00:53:37,370
Where have I been all my life?

684
00:53:38,181 --> 00:53:39,739
The dress is Chanel

685
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:41,713
The shoes YSL

686
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:43,614
The bag is Dior

687
00:53:43,787 --> 00:53:45,345
Agent Provocateur

688
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:47,247
My address today

689
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:49,354
L.A., by the way

690
00:53:49,526 --> 00:53:51,016
Above Sunset Strip

691
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:53,192
The Hills all the way

692
00:53:53,363 --> 00:53:54,921
My rings are by Webster

693
00:53:55,098 --> 00:53:56,690
It makes their heads twirl

694
00:53:57,167 --> 00:54:00,762
They all say, "Darling, what did you
Do for those pearls?"

695
00:54:00,937 --> 00:54:02,234
What?

696
00:54:03,873 --> 00:54:07,001
I am a good girl

697
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,958
So good.

698
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:07,026
Hey there, big boy.

699
00:56:08,932 --> 00:56:11,400
So, what do you think?

700
00:56:11,935 --> 00:56:13,368
I think you look...

701
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:15,231
I mean, it looks...

702
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:18,737
Jack, we're friends, for chrissake.

703
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:22,038
It's not like we're brother and sister.

704
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:27,942
No, we certainly are not.

705
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:30,678
I don't get why everyone's
having a conniption.

706
00:56:30,854 --> 00:56:33,880
She's just a tacky farm girl
from Iowa.

707
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:37,423
And we know a cow
when we see one.

708
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:43,224
Don't underestimate us farm girls.

709
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:47,164
Vince.

710
00:56:47,337 --> 00:56:48,770
This round's on me.

711
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:54,267
I don't normally do this...

712
00:56:54,444 --> 00:56:57,277
...but, Vince, I'm doubling my offer.

713
00:56:58,014 --> 00:56:59,982
It's either you or the auction house.

714
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,981
No, I am not selling.

715
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:04,484
Know what happens
when you default on a loan?

716
00:57:04,654 --> 00:57:05,712
No, hum a few bars.

717
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:08,756
I'm not screwing around.
Where's the money coming from?

718
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:11,655
Ali's a hit.
We can charge 50 bucks a head now.

719
00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:14,228
Raising the admission?
That's not good enough.

720
00:57:14,397 --> 00:57:17,264
You have been saying
that the sky is falling forever.

721
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,334
Everything always works out fine.

722
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:21,663
Tell that to the people
losing everything.

723
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:23,601
I don't wanna be one of them.

724
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:25,798
- I love this place too.
- No, you don't.

725
00:57:25,975 --> 00:57:27,169
- I do.
- No, you don't!

726
00:57:27,343 --> 00:57:29,243
- Yes, I do!
- Oh, no, you don't.

727
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:33,080
Look, you have many
fine qualities, Vincent.

728
00:57:33,249 --> 00:57:35,308
And then you've got
some iffy qualities.

729
00:57:35,485 --> 00:57:37,112
But you've never been a phony.

730
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:39,881
Just tell Marcus no.

731
00:57:55,705 --> 00:57:56,865
Jack?

732
00:57:59,576 --> 00:58:01,100
Yep. Just got in.

733
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:03,745
I'm in here.
Can you come zip me up?

734
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:08,740
Hey, where you been?

735
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,612
Writing music.

736
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:12,512
Can I hear?

737
00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:16,321
- It's not ready.
- It's not ready.

738
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:18,017
Who's that?

739
00:58:18,728 --> 00:58:20,423
Me and my mom
on my 7th birthday.

740
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,764
She died a few weeks later.

741
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:24,632
You must miss her.

742
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:29,934
Every single day something happens
that I wish I could tell her about.

743
00:58:31,274 --> 00:58:33,208
And what happened today?

744
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:39,140
Nothing yet.

745
00:58:46,289 --> 00:58:48,917
You should get that.
It's probably Natalie.

746
00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:50,320
Probably.

747
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:55,398
Hey, babe.

748
00:58:55,999 --> 00:58:57,193
Yes, I know.

749
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:39,031
Check it out, girls!

750
01:01:19,575 --> 01:01:20,769
I'm starved. You ready?

751
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:27,647
I can't. I'm so sorry.
I have to do inventory tonight.

752
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:28,977
Want me to call a cab?

753
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:31,848
No, that's okay.
I'll get a ride with Coco.

754
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:33,511
Sorry.

755
01:01:34,757 --> 01:01:36,452
Watch your back. Coming through.

756
01:01:36,626 --> 01:01:37,650
You ready?

757
01:01:39,228 --> 01:01:40,820
- For what?
- I'll drop you off.

758
01:01:40,997 --> 01:01:42,430
Coco left five minutes ago.

759
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,828
I was coming to talk to you.
I caught your conversation.

760
01:01:48,504 --> 01:01:51,268
- Talk to me about...?
- Dinner. With me. Give me that.

761
01:01:52,308 --> 01:01:55,709
If you ever expect to see
this bag alive again...

762
01:01:56,946 --> 01:01:58,311
...you'll follow me.

763
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:01,949
Hold on a second.
Where you going? Hey!

764
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:09,825
Where are you taking me?
This is not the way to my place.

765
01:02:09,992 --> 01:02:11,220
I told you. Dinner.

766
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:12,486
Dinner?

767
01:02:12,662 --> 01:02:15,961
I'm not going to dinner with you.
You're seeing Nikki.

768
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,091
We're just friends.

769
01:02:19,268 --> 01:02:21,998
Where I come from,
friends don't chew on earlobes.

770
01:02:22,171 --> 01:02:23,695
Aren't you glad you left?

771
01:02:24,474 --> 01:02:26,999
- Oh, damn it.
- What?

772
01:02:27,977 --> 01:02:30,502
I gotta make a quick appearance
at a party.

773
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,113
You just remembered.

774
01:02:32,281 --> 01:02:35,682
It's on the way. We'll be quick.
Ten minutes, tops. Do you mind?

775
01:02:35,852 --> 01:02:37,046
And if I do?

776
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:38,653
Then you've been kidnapped.

777
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:49,497
Hey, Marcus.

778
01:02:51,801 --> 01:02:53,132
Nice house.

779
01:02:58,908 --> 01:03:01,638
What are you doing?
You can't just take that.

780
01:03:03,746 --> 01:03:06,374
Put that back.
You're gonna get us kicked out.

781
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:07,777
Not if we sneak out.

782
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:13,341
Hey, hey. Greg, Marla, this is Ali.

783
01:03:13,516 --> 01:03:15,245
- Hi.
- Hey.

784
01:03:15,418 --> 01:03:17,045
My God, those are amazing shoes.

785
01:03:17,386 --> 01:03:18,853
Aren't they? Louboutin.

786
01:03:19,021 --> 01:03:20,045
Great party.

787
01:03:20,222 --> 01:03:21,917
Always good to have you, man.

788
01:03:22,825 --> 01:03:26,124
Wait a minute. You had to make
an appearance at your own party?

789
01:03:26,295 --> 01:03:28,160
Would've been rude not to, right?

790
01:03:28,397 --> 01:03:32,197
You'd like those guys.
Greg's an editor, Marla's a designer.

791
01:03:32,368 --> 01:03:34,893
I'm gonna dream about those shoes.

792
01:03:37,239 --> 01:03:39,469
L.A. looks gorgeous from up here.

793
01:03:40,242 --> 01:03:42,870
That view cost me three times
what the house did.

794
01:03:43,045 --> 01:03:44,672
See that strip mall down there?

795
01:03:45,147 --> 01:03:46,171
You own that too?

796
01:03:46,449 --> 01:03:48,417
No. I own everything above it.

797
01:03:49,452 --> 01:03:51,920
- There is nothing above it.
- Exactly.

798
01:03:52,121 --> 01:03:54,180
- So you own air.
- Air rights.

799
01:03:54,356 --> 01:03:57,792
Guy that owns the mall ran into
money issues, almost had to sell.

800
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:00,520
Whoever he sold to
would've put up a huge tower.

801
01:04:00,696 --> 01:04:03,187
So I bought the air rights.

802
01:04:03,699 --> 01:04:06,862
- No one can build above one story.
- Well, aren't you clever.

803
01:04:07,269 --> 01:04:11,706
Mall guy gets to keep his property,
I keep the second best view in L.A.

804
01:04:11,874 --> 01:04:12,898
What's the first?

805
01:04:16,078 --> 01:04:19,479
- How many girls you used that line on?
- None who called me on it.

806
01:04:22,218 --> 01:04:23,446
What do you want, Ali?

807
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:26,051
In life.

808
01:04:27,223 --> 01:04:28,622
And why should I tell you?

809
01:04:29,024 --> 01:04:31,424
You're talented enough
to get what you want...

810
01:04:31,594 --> 01:04:34,290
...and I'm smart enough
to make it happen.

811
01:04:47,643 --> 01:04:51,079
- Somebody got a package.
- Ali.

812
01:04:51,647 --> 01:04:53,274
- Ali.
- Who's it from?

813
01:04:56,152 --> 01:04:58,177
- Come on, open it.
- Let's see. Come on.

814
01:05:03,626 --> 01:05:05,389
Oh, my God.

815
01:05:05,761 --> 01:05:07,285
Those are so cute.

816
01:05:09,031 --> 01:05:12,091
- They're so pretty.
- Those are so pretty.

817
01:05:12,868 --> 01:05:13,892
Who's the sucker?

818
01:05:14,069 --> 01:05:16,094
Let's go. Girls, please, break it up.

819
01:05:16,272 --> 01:05:17,796
Coco, let's go. Five minutes.

820
01:05:17,973 --> 01:05:19,270
Ali Cat, you're up next.

821
01:05:19,441 --> 01:05:21,375
My nana used to call me Ali Cat.

822
01:05:21,544 --> 01:05:23,375
Did she really?
That's fascinating.

823
01:05:23,546 --> 01:05:25,946
- Why don't I have a nickname?
- Oh, you do.

824
01:05:26,115 --> 01:05:28,413
- Well, he never uses it.
- No, I do.

825
01:05:28,584 --> 01:05:29,608
When?

826
01:05:29,785 --> 01:05:31,275
When you leave the room.

827
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:33,349
- Slut.
- I heard that.

828
01:05:33,522 --> 01:05:36,218
So sorry! I had no idea!
Oh, my God.

829
01:05:36,392 --> 01:05:39,361
Girls, come on! We have a show to do!
Let's go, let's go!

830
01:05:39,528 --> 01:05:41,496
Hurry up! Come on!

831
01:05:43,933 --> 01:05:48,199
It's a cold and crazy world
That's raging outside

832
01:05:48,370 --> 01:05:53,364
But, baby, me and all my girls
Are bringin' on the fire

833
01:05:53,542 --> 01:05:57,000
Show a little leg
Gotta shimmy your chest

834
01:05:57,546 --> 01:06:00,982
It's a life, it's a style, it's a need

835
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:04,210
It's burlesque

836
01:07:05,581 --> 01:07:08,311
- Hey.
- Hey.

837
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:13,412
You were out late last night.

838
01:07:14,123 --> 01:07:16,887
Oh, I got a ride home
with that guy...

839
01:07:17,226 --> 01:07:18,420
...Marcus.

840
01:07:18,894 --> 01:07:20,020
Went to a party.

841
01:07:21,230 --> 01:07:22,322
Marcus?

842
01:07:25,267 --> 01:07:26,393
New shoes?

843
01:07:27,603 --> 01:07:28,661
Yeah.

844
01:07:30,739 --> 01:07:31,763
Classy.

845
01:08:08,377 --> 01:08:10,937
There's only one reason
a man buys a woman shoes.

846
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,805
So what if I'm getting
a little male attention?

847
01:08:13,982 --> 01:08:15,779
You're getting more than a little.

848
01:08:15,951 --> 01:08:17,475
Not from anyone that matters.

849
01:08:18,987 --> 01:08:21,148
I just think you should be careful.

850
01:08:21,323 --> 01:08:25,191
And I think if you need to tell a girl
what she should and shouldn't do...

851
01:08:25,661 --> 01:08:28,892
...you should pick up the phone
and call your fiancée.

852
01:10:33,989 --> 01:10:35,547
- That's major.
- My goodness.

853
01:10:35,757 --> 01:10:39,249
Major? Check again. The only thing
major is the size of Coco's ass.

854
01:10:40,963 --> 01:10:45,457
Monsieur Louboutin is at Table 18
and he's asking for you.

855
01:10:46,435 --> 01:10:48,096
It's a weird angle.

856
01:10:48,637 --> 01:10:49,661
Easy.

857
01:11:07,956 --> 01:11:09,253
I'm so glad you got to-

858
01:11:10,626 --> 01:11:13,151
There she is, the girl of the hour.

859
01:11:13,328 --> 01:11:15,296
You'd go to any length.

860
01:11:15,464 --> 01:11:17,955
I just made a call to Greg
at the Times.

861
01:11:18,133 --> 01:11:21,899
I want you to meet a friend of mine.
Ali Rose, Harold Saint.

862
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:25,938
Harold-? Shut up.
You worked with Etta James.

863
01:11:26,108 --> 01:11:28,508
Her. Chewed me up
and spat me out, that one.

864
01:11:30,846 --> 01:11:31,870
Hello.

865
01:11:34,016 --> 01:11:36,177
You've got a set of pipes too,
young lady.

866
01:11:36,885 --> 01:11:38,011
Thanks.

867
01:11:39,021 --> 01:11:41,216
We have to do
something about that.

868
01:11:41,390 --> 01:11:44,223
You snooze, you lose, pretty boy.

869
01:12:02,511 --> 01:12:03,808
Standing room only.

870
01:12:04,313 --> 01:12:05,780
Doesn't it look great?

871
01:12:06,949 --> 01:12:09,349
But I just got another notice
from the bank.

872
01:12:09,518 --> 01:12:14,512
We would have to fill Dodger Stadium
for a month to come up with the cash.

873
01:12:15,023 --> 01:12:17,457
I gotta figure out a way
to buy us more time.

874
01:12:24,433 --> 01:12:26,367
- Hey.
- Hey.

875
01:12:26,535 --> 01:12:28,264
That really is a great shot.

876
01:12:29,838 --> 01:12:32,807
It's so weird seeing myself
in the paper like that.

877
01:12:33,909 --> 01:12:35,934
Well, you might have to
get used to it.

878
01:12:37,913 --> 01:12:39,380
I don't think I ever could.

879
01:12:39,548 --> 01:12:44,008
You know, I don't wanna come off
like the wise old fairy godmother...

880
01:12:45,087 --> 01:12:47,715
...but maybe you could learn
from my mistakes.

881
01:12:47,889 --> 01:12:49,481
What do you mean?

882
01:12:49,658 --> 01:12:52,456
You gotta learn who are the people
you can trust...

883
01:12:52,628 --> 01:12:54,619
...the people who like you for you...

884
01:12:54,796 --> 01:12:57,594
...and who are the people
who just want something.

885
01:12:58,233 --> 01:13:00,565
- You don't like Marcus, do you?
- No, I don't.

886
01:13:01,003 --> 01:13:03,494
I don't like him. I don't trust him.

887
01:13:03,672 --> 01:13:06,266
I don't think you should trust him.

888
01:13:07,142 --> 01:13:11,579
But is that really what's best for me
or what's best for you?

889
01:13:11,747 --> 01:13:13,009
I don't know.

890
01:13:13,181 --> 01:13:15,741
I hope it's best for both of us.

891
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:19,282
All right.

892
01:13:21,189 --> 01:13:22,281
See you tomorrow.

893
01:13:29,765 --> 01:13:31,426
There you are.

894
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:35,199
These babies desperately need
your glue gun, okay?

895
01:13:35,370 --> 01:13:36,803
- Especially this one.
- Okay.

896
01:13:36,972 --> 01:13:38,166
- Okay?
- Yep.

897
01:13:39,641 --> 01:13:41,336
She's not going anywhere.

898
01:13:42,477 --> 01:13:44,035
- Good night.
- Night.

899
01:13:51,787 --> 01:13:53,414
Oh, hey, Tess.

900
01:13:53,588 --> 01:13:56,523
I got that track you wanted to rehearse
for tomorrow.

901
01:13:57,459 --> 01:13:58,551
Jesus.

902
01:13:58,727 --> 01:14:03,221
Honey, I'm sorry. I got a million things
on my mind and I completely forgot.

903
01:14:03,432 --> 01:14:04,865
It's all good.

904
01:14:05,467 --> 01:14:07,935
If it's too late I can come in
early tomorrow?

905
01:14:08,470 --> 01:14:12,338
No, no.
Let's just get it out of the way.

906
01:14:18,847 --> 01:14:20,178
You want a spot?

907
01:14:20,716 --> 01:14:22,081
Yeah.

908
01:14:35,197 --> 01:14:38,826
Feelin' broken

909
01:14:39,201 --> 01:14:43,160
Barely holdin' on

910
01:14:43,772 --> 01:14:47,264
But there's still something so strong

911
01:14:47,876 --> 01:14:50,106
Somewhere inside me

912
01:14:50,512 --> 01:14:52,070
And I am down

913
01:14:52,247 --> 01:14:54,272
But I'll get up again

914
01:14:54,483 --> 01:14:58,476
Don't count me out just yet

915
01:14:59,888 --> 01:15:02,755
I've been brought

916
01:15:03,024 --> 01:15:05,925
Down to my knees

917
01:15:07,195 --> 01:15:09,686
And I've been pushed

918
01:15:10,699 --> 01:15:13,532
Way past the point of breakin'

919
01:15:13,935 --> 01:15:16,028
But I can take it

920
01:15:16,204 --> 01:15:18,035
I'll be back

921
01:15:18,406 --> 01:15:21,432
Back on my feet

922
01:15:22,277 --> 01:15:25,144
This is far from over

923
01:15:25,413 --> 01:15:27,881
You haven't seen the last of me

924
01:15:29,317 --> 01:15:31,615
You haven't seen the last of me

925
01:15:32,387 --> 01:15:35,788
They can say that

926
01:15:37,125 --> 01:15:40,219
I won't stay around

927
01:15:40,796 --> 01:15:44,163
But I'm gonna stand my ground

928
01:15:44,599 --> 01:15:46,794
You're not gonna stop me

929
01:15:47,269 --> 01:15:48,793
You don't know me

930
01:15:48,970 --> 01:15:50,631
You don't know who I am

931
01:15:51,072 --> 01:15:55,441
Don't count me out so fast

932
01:15:55,610 --> 01:15:58,204
I've been brought

933
01:15:58,814 --> 01:16:01,544
Down to my knees

934
01:16:02,918 --> 01:16:05,546
And I've been pushed

935
01:16:06,421 --> 01:16:09,481
Way past the point of breakin'

936
01:16:09,658 --> 01:16:11,148
But I can take it

937
01:16:11,326 --> 01:16:13,351
I'll be back

938
01:16:14,196 --> 01:16:16,994
Back on my feet

939
01:16:18,066 --> 01:16:20,500
This is far from over

940
01:16:21,136 --> 01:16:23,297
You haven't seen the last of me

941
01:16:23,772 --> 01:16:25,535
There will be no fade-out

942
01:16:25,707 --> 01:16:27,334
This is not the end

943
01:16:27,509 --> 01:16:30,967
I'm down now
But I'll be standin' tall again

944
01:16:31,379 --> 01:16:34,780
Times are hard but I was built tough

945
01:16:35,183 --> 01:16:40,678
I'm gonna show you all
What I'm made of

946
01:16:41,356 --> 01:16:44,120
I've been brought

947
01:16:44,392 --> 01:16:47,361
Down to my knees

948
01:16:48,697 --> 01:16:51,894
And I've been pushed

949
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:55,160
Way past the point of breakin'

950
01:16:55,337 --> 01:16:57,237
But I can take it

951
01:16:57,405 --> 01:16:59,305
I'll be back

952
01:16:59,741 --> 01:17:02,608
Back on my feet

953
01:17:03,712 --> 01:17:06,306
This is far from over

954
01:17:07,482 --> 01:17:10,542
I am far from over

955
01:17:12,554 --> 01:17:14,749
You haven't seen the last of me

956
01:17:15,223 --> 01:17:19,023
No, no, I'm not goin' nowhere

957
01:17:19,227 --> 01:17:21,855
I'm stayin' right here

958
01:17:22,898 --> 01:17:26,231
Oh, no, you won't see me fade out

959
01:17:26,401 --> 01:17:29,234
I'm not takin' my bow

960
01:17:30,438 --> 01:17:32,235
Can't stop me

961
01:17:32,407 --> 01:17:36,366
It's not the end

962
01:17:39,514 --> 01:17:44,645
You haven't seen the last of me

963
01:17:45,587 --> 01:17:51,025
Oh, no, you haven't seen
The last of me

964
01:17:51,226 --> 01:17:55,788
You haven't seen the last of me

965
01:18:16,418 --> 01:18:18,318
- Tess, we need to talk.
- No.

966
01:18:18,486 --> 01:18:19,919
- Yes.
- I'm tired, Nikki.

967
01:18:20,088 --> 01:18:21,783
Well, then you can just listen.

968
01:18:21,957 --> 01:18:23,891
We built this club together...

969
01:18:24,059 --> 01:18:26,459
...and then some girl shows up
from nowhere...

970
01:18:26,628 --> 01:18:29,722
- ... who hasn't paid her dues-
- How do you know?

971
01:18:29,898 --> 01:18:32,594
Doesn't sing that way
because she's had it easy.

972
01:18:32,767 --> 01:18:35,736
"They don't come
to hear us sing, Nikki."

973
01:18:35,904 --> 01:18:38,498
Or is that just bullshit now?

974
01:18:38,707 --> 01:18:40,902
You're drunk.
Go inside and call a cab.

975
01:18:41,076 --> 01:18:43,510
I will not be upstaged by some slut!

976
01:18:43,678 --> 01:18:45,407
Then leave.

977
01:18:47,048 --> 01:18:50,017
You'd ruin our friendship
over some girl you barely know?

978
01:18:50,185 --> 01:18:51,345
So much for loyalty!

979
01:18:51,519 --> 01:18:54,079
Since when did you know
anything about loyalty?

980
01:18:54,255 --> 01:18:56,883
How many times
have I peeled you off the sidewalk?

981
01:18:57,058 --> 01:18:58,082
How many blackouts?

982
01:18:58,259 --> 01:19:00,250
How many times
have I held your head...

983
01:19:00,428 --> 01:19:02,828
...while you threw up everything
but memories?

984
01:19:02,998 --> 01:19:06,297
Okay, fine!
But I will not stand in the back!

985
01:19:06,468 --> 01:19:08,026
Tess, you need to fix this-

986
01:19:08,236 --> 01:19:11,364
You think you're my only problem?
I'm about to lose my club.

987
01:19:11,539 --> 01:19:13,734
The only thing
that means anything to me.

988
01:19:13,908 --> 01:19:18,004
I have more to worry about than you
pouring tequila on your Cheerios.

989
01:19:19,047 --> 01:19:21,475
Fine.

990
01:19:21,983 --> 01:19:24,110
- I quit!
- I'm glad!

991
01:19:28,289 --> 01:19:29,847
Nikki, don't drive.

992
01:19:30,525 --> 01:19:32,015
By the way...

993
01:19:32,394 --> 01:19:35,158
...I slept with Vince
the night after your honeymoon.

994
01:19:48,309 --> 01:19:50,402
You crazy bitch!

995
01:20:24,345 --> 01:20:25,369
Morning.

996
01:20:26,247 --> 01:20:29,648
Do you really have to do that
at 6 a. m.?

997
01:20:29,884 --> 01:20:30,942
Coffee?

998
01:20:31,119 --> 01:20:34,213
No, but a little peace and quiet
would be nice.

999
01:20:34,389 --> 01:20:36,983
You are a little overdressed
for breakfast.

1000
01:20:37,158 --> 01:20:40,059
My pajamas were in the bedroom,
which was occupied.

1001
01:20:40,228 --> 01:20:43,789
You're never here, so it'd be stupid
for me to crash on the couch...

1002
01:20:43,965 --> 01:20:47,093
...when there is a perfectly good,
empty bed right there.

1003
01:20:49,370 --> 01:20:51,361
So, what, do you want
the bedroom back?

1004
01:20:51,539 --> 01:20:52,904
Should be used by someone.

1005
01:20:53,074 --> 01:20:54,336
I'm home every night.

1006
01:20:54,509 --> 01:20:58,707
Maybe not when you think I should be.
You are my roommate, not my mother.

1007
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,871
However, since it's such an issue...

1008
01:21:01,049 --> 01:21:04,348
What the hell. Take the bedroom.
I'll sleep on the couch.

1009
01:21:04,519 --> 01:21:05,611
- Fine!
- Fine.

1010
01:21:05,787 --> 01:21:08,347
- You're gonna have to move your shit.
- I realize.

1011
01:21:08,523 --> 01:21:10,115
It is a total mess in there.

1012
01:21:10,291 --> 01:21:13,124
You got stuff everywhere.
Clothes, shoes, hair-

1013
01:21:13,294 --> 01:21:16,422
Jesus! What is your problem?
You're acting like a prick.

1014
01:21:16,598 --> 01:21:18,088
Something you wanna say?

1015
01:21:18,266 --> 01:21:19,528
It's not just me.

1016
01:21:19,701 --> 01:21:22,226
The people that care about you
are worried.

1017
01:21:22,604 --> 01:21:23,764
What people?

1018
01:21:23,938 --> 01:21:26,771
People, you know? People.
Your friends at the club.

1019
01:21:26,941 --> 01:21:28,169
We're like a family.

1020
01:21:28,343 --> 01:21:30,038
And we look out for each other.

1021
01:21:30,211 --> 01:21:33,180
You look out for each other.
Like Vince looks after Tess.

1022
01:21:33,348 --> 01:21:35,873
And like Nikki looks out
for everybody.

1023
01:21:36,050 --> 01:21:38,450
And Marcus?
He's gonna look out for you?

1024
01:21:39,888 --> 01:21:41,753
No, it's fine. It's fine.

1025
01:21:41,923 --> 01:21:44,084
He can make things happen for you.

1026
01:21:45,393 --> 01:21:47,520
So go ahead,
make a deal with the devil.

1027
01:21:47,695 --> 01:21:49,458
First, Marcus is not the devil.

1028
01:21:49,631 --> 01:21:51,258
He's a smart businessman...

1029
01:21:51,432 --> 01:21:56,233
...who happens to be a gentleman who
knows what he wants and goes for it.

1030
01:21:56,404 --> 01:22:00,306
I'm just saying.
Life is about the choices you make.

1031
01:22:00,808 --> 01:22:02,435
The choices I make?

1032
01:22:02,610 --> 01:22:05,101
You're a
bartender-slash-piano player...

1033
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:08,374
...who writes songs
that are never ready.

1034
01:22:11,452 --> 01:22:13,750
That's perfect. Perfect.

1035
01:22:18,693 --> 01:22:22,060
Please, try not to destroy
my apartment. Thanks.

1036
01:22:23,932 --> 01:22:26,332
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1037
01:22:26,501 --> 01:22:27,798
You may kiss the bride.

1038
01:22:35,109 --> 01:22:38,670
Wait, what do you mean
you are still in New York? Why?

1039
01:22:39,147 --> 01:22:41,638
So you just decided not to come?

1040
01:22:42,116 --> 01:22:46,280
Why does every conversation we have
end up being about your future?

1041
01:22:47,388 --> 01:22:48,616
You know, you're right.

1042
01:22:48,790 --> 01:22:51,054
We should start thinking
about our futures.

1043
01:22:51,226 --> 01:22:53,353
And I might be looking at mine
right now.

1044
01:22:58,132 --> 01:22:59,656
That DJ is hot.

1045
01:22:59,834 --> 01:23:00,926
You think so?

1046
01:23:02,203 --> 01:23:04,068
He keeps looking at me.

1047
01:23:04,239 --> 01:23:06,002
Maybe he's cuckoo for Coco Puffs.

1048
01:23:06,174 --> 01:23:07,471
Really? You think?

1049
01:23:07,642 --> 01:23:08,973
Yeah. I think.

1050
01:23:10,912 --> 01:23:12,846
He's gorgeous. I think he likes me.

1051
01:23:13,147 --> 01:23:14,910
He is gorgeous.

1052
01:23:19,220 --> 01:23:22,986
Who is paying for this wedding?
This rental must have cost a fortune.

1053
01:23:23,157 --> 01:23:25,057
Damon's dad is loaded.

1054
01:23:25,393 --> 01:23:26,655
Is he single?

1055
01:23:26,828 --> 01:23:29,661
I'm just kidding. I'm kidding.

1056
01:23:30,398 --> 01:23:32,889
Guess Georgia's not as dumb
as I thought.

1057
01:23:33,701 --> 01:23:36,067
Would you ever do this again?

1058
01:23:36,571 --> 01:23:37,833
No.

1059
01:23:38,006 --> 01:23:41,772
There's only one man I could see
spending the rest of my life with.

1060
01:23:42,143 --> 01:23:47,376
And unfortunately, except for a really
drunk night in Reno 25,000 years ago...

1061
01:23:47,548 --> 01:23:49,209
...he bats for the other team.

1062
01:23:49,550 --> 01:23:52,348
Oh, no. He bats for the pink team.

1063
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:54,010
Yes.

1064
01:23:55,256 --> 01:23:56,746
That is tragique.

1065
01:23:56,924 --> 01:23:58,289
I know.

1066
01:23:58,893 --> 01:24:01,384
Well, it's like all
truly great love affairs.

1067
01:24:01,562 --> 01:24:03,291
Yeah.

1068
01:24:03,464 --> 01:24:04,692
Tragic.

1069
01:24:06,234 --> 01:24:08,862
It wasn't Reno. It was Tahoe, baby.

1070
01:24:09,037 --> 01:24:10,561
And it was lovely.

1071
01:24:11,372 --> 01:24:12,669
Get a room.

1072
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:13,864
Get away.

1073
01:24:21,749 --> 01:24:23,717
Shot of Patrón, please.

1074
01:24:24,619 --> 01:24:26,587
Make it two. Make it two.

1075
01:24:27,689 --> 01:24:30,089
Looking kind of lonely there, Jack.

1076
01:24:30,258 --> 01:24:31,782
Liberated, maybe.

1077
01:24:32,460 --> 01:24:34,360
Libated, definitely.

1078
01:24:35,096 --> 01:24:37,587
But lonely, no. Never lonely.

1079
01:24:37,765 --> 01:24:38,925
Cheers.

1080
01:24:41,769 --> 01:24:42,793
Clink.

1081
01:24:49,510 --> 01:24:50,738
How's it going?

1082
01:24:50,912 --> 01:24:52,641
God. What are we, in junior high?

1083
01:24:52,814 --> 01:24:55,510
Iowa, are you still mad at me?

1084
01:24:55,983 --> 01:24:58,008
You know, because if you are...

1085
01:24:58,219 --> 01:24:59,447
...bring it on, baby.

1086
01:24:59,620 --> 01:25:00,644
Are you drunk?

1087
01:25:00,822 --> 01:25:03,655
Oh, I love this song. Yes!

1088
01:25:03,825 --> 01:25:05,452
Oh, you rock.

1089
01:25:05,626 --> 01:25:07,753
Yeah, baby. You rock.

1090
01:25:13,668 --> 01:25:16,364
I'm sorry for being a class-A prick.

1091
01:25:16,537 --> 01:25:17,936
You were.

1092
01:25:18,339 --> 01:25:19,533
I was.

1093
01:25:19,841 --> 01:25:22,867
And, as of about...

1094
01:25:24,812 --> 01:25:27,747
...some time ago,
I am officially a single man.

1095
01:25:28,316 --> 01:25:30,216
You and Natalie broke up?

1096
01:25:30,385 --> 01:25:31,477
That we did.

1097
01:25:31,652 --> 01:25:34,348
Which explains why
I am here alone.

1098
01:25:34,789 --> 01:25:36,017
So...

1099
01:25:36,758 --> 01:25:39,158
...why are you here alone?

1100
01:25:40,395 --> 01:25:42,795
Do I really look alone to you?

1101
01:25:44,198 --> 01:25:45,392
Come here.

1102
01:25:46,634 --> 01:25:48,124
Jack.

1103
01:25:57,178 --> 01:25:58,475
Careful.

1104
01:26:00,648 --> 01:26:04,584
Oh, my feet are killing me.
Take off these shoes, please. Help me.

1105
01:26:04,786 --> 01:26:06,185
Wait, wait. Be careful.

1106
01:26:08,589 --> 01:26:10,352
I got it. No. No.

1107
01:26:12,894 --> 01:26:14,122
Stay.

1108
01:26:23,738 --> 01:26:24,762
Good night.

1109
01:26:25,606 --> 01:26:27,437
Here. Yeah.

1110
01:26:29,177 --> 01:26:30,371
Night.

1111
01:26:38,753 --> 01:26:40,050
Okay.

1112
01:26:42,190 --> 01:26:43,680
Cute jammies.

1113
01:26:43,925 --> 01:26:46,553
My mother got me these,
thank you very much.

1114
01:26:46,727 --> 01:26:48,854
And I haven't worn them yet, so...

1115
01:26:49,897 --> 01:26:51,262
Go figure.

1116
01:26:52,967 --> 01:26:54,525
I forgot to lock the door.

1117
01:26:56,604 --> 01:26:59,903
- Got it?
- Good.

1118
01:27:03,711 --> 01:27:05,235
Good night.

1119
01:27:05,947 --> 01:27:07,073
Good night.

1120
01:27:12,553 --> 01:27:13,577
Back again?

1121
01:27:13,754 --> 01:27:16,086
Water. Don't want a hangover.

1122
01:27:16,457 --> 01:27:17,856
Smart.

1123
01:27:30,638 --> 01:27:32,731
Good night. Again.

1124
01:27:34,575 --> 01:27:37,237
Night. Again.

1125
01:27:43,951 --> 01:27:47,409
Now, I know-
I know I forgot something else.

1126
01:27:47,588 --> 01:27:49,886
I remember I locked the door.

1127
01:27:50,758 --> 01:27:53,488
That's it. Hungry. I'm hungry.

1128
01:27:54,028 --> 01:27:55,325
Exactly.

1129
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:02,094
- What is so funny?
- Jack! Well, you're-

1130
01:28:02,670 --> 01:28:04,661
Well, I never.

1131
01:28:07,542 --> 01:28:09,942
- Jack.
- Want a cookie?

1132
01:28:11,779 --> 01:28:12,837
No?

1133
01:28:13,548 --> 01:28:15,448
- All right.
- Jack.

1134
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:18,483
It's your loss.
You change your mind...

1135
01:28:19,287 --> 01:28:20,720
...you know where they are.

1136
01:29:24,752 --> 01:29:30,186
Sweet love

1137
01:29:30,358 --> 01:29:32,622
Trapped in your love

1138
01:29:33,694 --> 01:29:38,631
I've opened up

1139
01:29:38,799 --> 01:29:41,768
Unsure I can trust

1140
01:29:42,536 --> 01:29:50,409
My heart and I were buried in dust

1141
01:29:58,019 --> 01:29:59,646
So it's official.

1142
01:30:02,023 --> 01:30:03,217
What?

1143
01:30:04,425 --> 01:30:07,519
You are definitely not gay.

1144
01:30:08,729 --> 01:30:10,424
So, what about Natalie?

1145
01:30:17,271 --> 01:30:18,329
Natalie who?

1146
01:30:18,539 --> 01:30:22,566
I found a man I can trust

1147
01:30:22,743 --> 01:30:26,907
And, boy, I believe in us

1148
01:30:27,081 --> 01:30:34,078
I am terrified to love
For the first time

1149
01:30:35,423 --> 01:30:40,258
Can you see
That I'm bound in chains

1150
01:30:40,428 --> 01:30:44,489
I finally found my way

1151
01:30:44,665 --> 01:30:47,998
I am bound to you

1152
01:30:48,936 --> 01:30:53,100
I am bound to you

1153
01:31:04,085 --> 01:31:05,313
Do that again.

1154
01:31:11,292 --> 01:31:12,657
Now come here.

1155
01:31:50,131 --> 01:31:52,622
I mean, I don't really know
what happened.

1156
01:31:55,236 --> 01:32:00,333
I had won the Nashville Teen
Songwriting Contest.

1157
01:32:01,308 --> 01:32:03,333
I even still have my little trophy.

1158
01:32:03,511 --> 01:32:04,671
So I took that as-

1159
01:32:04,845 --> 01:32:08,178
I thought I was supposed to do
something important with my life.

1160
01:32:08,582 --> 01:32:10,277
Then I got to L.A.

1161
01:32:10,451 --> 01:32:12,282
And nothing happened.

1162
01:32:13,954 --> 01:32:15,216
Nothing.

1163
01:32:16,857 --> 01:32:18,381
Well, you know what?

1164
01:32:19,426 --> 01:32:21,792
I believe your music is ready.

1165
01:32:23,464 --> 01:32:25,295
The question is...

1166
01:32:27,568 --> 01:32:28,967
...are you ready?

1167
01:32:30,171 --> 01:32:32,366
- For what?
- Are you ready? Here I come.

1168
01:33:59,793 --> 01:34:01,158
- I knew it.
- Natalie.

1169
01:34:01,328 --> 01:34:04,195
You are a liar.
A pathetic, sneaky little liar!

1170
01:34:04,365 --> 01:34:05,559
What is she doing here?

1171
01:34:05,733 --> 01:34:08,201
I live here.
I wanna know why you are here.

1172
01:34:08,502 --> 01:34:12,666
I can't believe I bought your bullshit.
"She's nothing. She's not even pretty."

1173
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:15,331
Well, at least you were honest
about one thing.

1174
01:34:15,542 --> 01:34:17,032
- You said that?
- I did not.

1175
01:34:17,211 --> 01:34:18,473
- He did.
- No, I didn't.

1176
01:34:18,646 --> 01:34:21,012
- Yes, he said that.
- Look...

1177
01:34:21,415 --> 01:34:23,815
I'm sorry, could you just give me
some time-?

1178
01:34:24,151 --> 01:34:25,550
You're asking me to leave?

1179
01:34:25,719 --> 01:34:27,414
- No.
- Yes, you. I'm the fiancée.

1180
01:34:27,655 --> 01:34:30,180
- You told me you broke it off with her.
- I did.

1181
01:34:30,357 --> 01:34:32,348
You break up with me
over the phone?

1182
01:34:32,526 --> 01:34:35,222
- I'm out of here. You said it was over.
- No. Ali.

1183
01:34:35,396 --> 01:34:37,023
- Ali, please.
- What, Jack?

1184
01:34:37,364 --> 01:34:38,956
- I am sorry.
- So am I.

1185
01:34:40,935 --> 01:34:42,027
I'm out.

1186
01:34:42,202 --> 01:34:43,404
Ali, wait. Please.

1187
01:34:49,176 --> 01:34:50,871
I must have the wrong apartment.

1188
01:34:51,045 --> 01:34:52,512
Who are you looking for?

1189
01:34:52,680 --> 01:34:54,841
- I'm looking for Sean.
- Sean.

1190
01:34:55,015 --> 01:34:56,175
What's he look like?

1191
01:34:56,684 --> 01:34:58,117
Yea high.

1192
01:34:58,686 --> 01:34:59,710
Shaved head.

1193
01:35:00,554 --> 01:35:02,715
Brown eyes. Glasses.

1194
01:35:02,890 --> 01:35:04,050
Sean.

1195
01:35:04,224 --> 01:35:06,317
I've been calling him John.

1196
01:35:08,262 --> 01:35:09,820
No, it's Sean.

1197
01:35:10,898 --> 01:35:11,922
Is that him?

1198
01:35:12,833 --> 01:35:13,857
Yeah.

1199
01:35:19,373 --> 01:35:20,897
Hi.

1200
01:35:23,344 --> 01:35:26,074
- What are you doing here?
- It's a long story.

1201
01:35:26,246 --> 01:35:27,679
I shouldn't have come here.

1202
01:35:27,848 --> 01:35:30,373
I see I've obviously
interrupted something.

1203
01:35:30,551 --> 01:35:31,711
Might be a bad time.

1204
01:35:31,885 --> 01:35:33,147
No, that's okay.

1205
01:35:33,354 --> 01:35:36,289
I'm sorry. Ali, did you meet...

1206
01:35:37,624 --> 01:35:39,956
- ... Mike?
- Close. My name is Mark.

1207
01:35:40,127 --> 01:35:41,719
Hi, Mark.

1208
01:35:43,630 --> 01:35:46,558
Sorry.

1209
01:35:47,768 --> 01:35:49,463
Does anybody want any coffee?

1210
01:35:49,636 --> 01:35:52,434
Yeah. Why don't I go
make the coffee...

1211
01:35:53,007 --> 01:35:55,305
...and you guys
get better acquainted.

1212
01:35:56,877 --> 01:35:59,277
Sorry. Did I call you Mike last night?

1213
01:36:01,582 --> 01:36:03,174
Yes. Yeah.

1214
01:36:03,384 --> 01:36:05,784
- But I called you John, so...
- Really?

1215
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:07,744
You liked it.

1216
01:36:09,256 --> 01:36:11,451
John was my mother's name.

1217
01:36:19,033 --> 01:36:20,830
- Hey.
- Hey, gorgeous.

1218
01:36:23,470 --> 01:36:24,494
Hey, Marcus.

1219
01:36:25,005 --> 01:36:27,064
You okay? You sound down.

1220
01:36:27,241 --> 01:36:28,469
I've been better.

1221
01:36:28,642 --> 01:36:30,166
Well, I have just the cure.

1222
01:36:30,344 --> 01:36:31,675
- What's that?
- Me.

1223
01:36:32,112 --> 01:36:34,512
Why don't you come over
for dinner?

1224
01:36:46,193 --> 01:36:47,922
Okay, well...

1225
01:36:49,196 --> 01:36:52,165
- Bye.
- Yeah, bye. You...

1226
01:36:53,834 --> 01:36:55,665
You take care...

1227
01:36:57,371 --> 01:37:00,204
- ... Sean.
- You too. Okay.

1228
01:37:04,745 --> 01:37:06,110
Okay, bye.

1229
01:37:07,381 --> 01:37:08,575
Is Ali here?

1230
01:37:08,749 --> 01:37:10,216
Ali left.

1231
01:37:10,651 --> 01:37:11,982
She went with Marcus.

1232
01:37:12,352 --> 01:37:13,376
Is that true?

1233
01:37:14,488 --> 01:37:15,546
Yeah.

1234
01:37:15,856 --> 01:37:17,983
- What?
- She left a couple hours ago.

1235
01:37:18,158 --> 01:37:21,150
I told you that opportunity
wouldn't knock forever.

1236
01:37:22,229 --> 01:37:24,823
You're right. It doesn't.

1237
01:37:28,869 --> 01:37:29,893
Hey.

1238
01:37:32,005 --> 01:37:33,199
You.

1239
01:37:33,373 --> 01:37:34,499
It's Mark.

1240
01:37:35,776 --> 01:37:37,209
Mark.

1241
01:37:38,045 --> 01:37:39,672
Do you want to have some lunch?

1242
01:37:40,514 --> 01:37:42,311
Yeah. Sure.

1243
01:37:44,384 --> 01:37:46,011
You're cooking.

1244
01:37:47,921 --> 01:37:50,412
I just wasted my whole
goddamn afternoon...

1245
01:37:50,591 --> 01:37:53,526
...talking with
the vice president of loans.

1246
01:37:53,894 --> 01:37:57,057
This asshole- No, wait.
He didn't even look me in the eye.

1247
01:37:57,231 --> 01:38:01,031
He just sat there, playing with
this wooden thingy on his desk.

1248
01:38:01,201 --> 01:38:04,898
- What thingy? What?
- The long wooden block thingy.

1249
01:38:05,072 --> 01:38:06,096
The nameplate?

1250
01:38:06,273 --> 01:38:08,207
Yes. Nameplate.

1251
01:38:08,575 --> 01:38:09,906
Yeah, and?

1252
01:38:10,077 --> 01:38:12,068
And he's not gonna
give me the money.

1253
01:38:12,613 --> 01:38:15,275
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

1254
01:38:15,449 --> 01:38:17,076
I'm not a good risk.

1255
01:38:17,251 --> 01:38:20,687
And I've got two days
before the bank takes the club.

1256
01:38:21,121 --> 01:38:23,487
Well, then...

1257
01:38:24,525 --> 01:38:27,119
...I would say that the situation
is pretty bleak.

1258
01:38:27,561 --> 01:38:31,019
And I would say that you are a master
of the fucking obvious.

1259
01:38:31,331 --> 01:38:32,889
Why did you say that?

1260
01:38:33,066 --> 01:38:36,467
What do you mean, "Why did I
say that"? Because it's the truth.

1261
01:38:36,637 --> 01:38:39,037
Tess, it's not a judgment,
it's the truth.

1262
01:38:39,206 --> 01:38:40,537
You don't have any money.

1263
01:38:40,707 --> 01:38:43,574
The bank won't give you a loan.
It's the eleventh hour.

1264
01:38:43,744 --> 01:38:45,234
Hello?

1265
01:38:47,848 --> 01:38:50,316
If I were you,
I would take Marcus's offer now.

1266
01:38:50,484 --> 01:38:51,508
No.

1267
01:38:51,685 --> 01:38:54,085
And you don't get to say that to me.

1268
01:38:54,621 --> 01:38:58,955
I can take "the sky is falling" from
everyone else, but not you.

1269
01:38:59,493 --> 01:39:02,326
You know, I need you to be the one
that says:

1270
01:39:02,629 --> 01:39:04,460
"It's only a number, Tess."

1271
01:39:05,599 --> 01:39:08,227
We have killed ourselves
to keep this place going.

1272
01:39:08,402 --> 01:39:09,835
How can you just walk away?

1273
01:39:11,205 --> 01:39:14,174
I don't care if you walk away,
I don't care what happens.

1274
01:39:14,341 --> 01:39:17,003
I will beat down the door
of every bank in L.A.

1275
01:39:17,177 --> 01:39:19,441
I will never give up this club.

1276
01:39:20,414 --> 01:39:21,438
Are you sure?

1277
01:39:21,615 --> 01:39:23,674
I will never give it up.

1278
01:39:28,121 --> 01:39:29,486
There she is.

1279
01:39:29,990 --> 01:39:33,482
I thought I'd lost you for a minute
at the beginning there.

1280
01:39:35,395 --> 01:39:37,693
You are such an asshole.

1281
01:39:37,898 --> 01:39:39,388
Thank you.

1282
01:40:14,167 --> 01:40:15,293
Hope you're hungry.

1283
01:40:15,469 --> 01:40:16,902
Steaks are on.

1284
01:40:17,070 --> 01:40:18,503
What is this?

1285
01:40:19,439 --> 01:40:20,701
Right now it's a model.

1286
01:40:20,874 --> 01:40:23,502
When it grows up
it'll be multi-use space...

1287
01:40:23,677 --> 01:40:24,939
...residential, retail.

1288
01:40:25,145 --> 01:40:27,045
But this is the Burlesque Lounge.

1289
01:40:27,214 --> 01:40:29,273
Best view on the Sunset Strip...

1290
01:40:29,449 --> 01:40:31,314
...with no windows.

1291
01:40:32,753 --> 01:40:35,347
When I'm through with it,
it'll have a thousand.

1292
01:40:35,689 --> 01:40:37,054
Does Tess know about this?

1293
01:40:37,224 --> 01:40:41,388
- Tess knows I've made an offer to buy.
- What makes you think she'd sell?

1294
01:40:41,561 --> 01:40:44,587
I don't think she has a choice.
She's going under.

1295
01:40:44,765 --> 01:40:48,394
It's a win-win situation for everyone.
It's business, not personal.

1296
01:40:48,568 --> 01:40:50,263
I think it's personal for Tess.

1297
01:40:50,937 --> 01:40:53,371
And for Coco and Sean and...

1298
01:40:53,540 --> 01:40:54,700
What about me?

1299
01:40:54,875 --> 01:40:58,402
There are other clubs that you can
sing and dance in. Better ones.

1300
01:40:59,079 --> 01:41:00,444
You don't get it.

1301
01:41:00,881 --> 01:41:04,544
I don't understand. I'm trying to do
something that benefits everyone.

1302
01:41:04,718 --> 01:41:08,051
- How does that make me the bad guy?
- It doesn't, Marcus.

1303
01:41:09,056 --> 01:41:11,251
It just makes you the wrong guy.

1304
01:41:37,417 --> 01:41:38,611
Hi.

1305
01:41:40,253 --> 01:41:42,118
So how'd it go at the bank?

1306
01:41:42,656 --> 01:41:44,021
This good.

1307
01:41:47,160 --> 01:41:48,525
You want a glass for that?

1308
01:41:48,695 --> 01:41:51,459
No, no. I am way beyond a glass.

1309
01:41:52,766 --> 01:41:55,291
- Tess, I gotta talk to you.
- Not right now.

1310
01:41:55,469 --> 01:41:58,802
Marcus is gonna tear down the club
and build a skyscraper.

1311
01:41:59,506 --> 01:42:00,871
And how do you know this?

1312
01:42:01,041 --> 01:42:04,306
- I saw the model.
- I didn't know you were close.

1313
01:42:04,478 --> 01:42:06,810
We're not.
I rushed over so I could tell you.

1314
01:42:06,980 --> 01:42:09,346
You're spreading yourself
a little bit thin.

1315
01:42:09,516 --> 01:42:12,314
Jack, Marcus, whoever.

1316
01:42:12,486 --> 01:42:14,818
Tess, I'm trying to help you.

1317
01:42:14,988 --> 01:42:16,683
- Let it go.
- She's gotta listen.

1318
01:42:16,857 --> 01:42:18,290
Okay. Let it go, let it go.

1319
01:42:18,458 --> 01:42:20,619
- She needs to listen.
- She can't now.

1320
01:42:20,794 --> 01:42:23,354
Well, she's gonna hear me.
Watch this.

1321
01:42:25,065 --> 01:42:26,430
Tess, I gotta talk to you.

1322
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:31,333
- You could knock. This is still my office.
- You need to hear what I tell you.

1323
01:42:31,505 --> 01:42:34,030
I don't. I am tired of talking.
I am talked out.

1324
01:42:34,207 --> 01:42:36,573
- Hear me out.
- I don't wanna hear you out.

1325
01:42:36,777 --> 01:42:40,042
Do you ever listen to anything
other than your own voice?

1326
01:42:47,087 --> 01:42:48,281
Talk.

1327
01:42:49,022 --> 01:42:50,990
Have you ever heard of air rights?

1328
01:42:51,425 --> 01:42:55,384
No, I've never heard of air rights.
What are air rights?

1329
01:43:18,018 --> 01:43:19,110
Now, that's funny.

1330
01:43:20,253 --> 01:43:22,278
Jim, let me call you back, huh?

1331
01:43:24,891 --> 01:43:26,017
Please sit down.

1332
01:43:26,193 --> 01:43:29,185
A few years ago you wanted to buy
my club and I said no.

1333
01:43:29,362 --> 01:43:31,330
Yeah, and now
you changed your mind?

1334
01:43:31,498 --> 01:43:33,762
No, but just bear with me
for a second...

1335
01:43:33,934 --> 01:43:37,597
...because I promise this is gonna
have a happy ending for both of us.

1336
01:43:37,804 --> 01:43:40,204
How much you planning to sell
your condos for?

1337
01:43:40,774 --> 01:43:45,541
Well, they start at a million and go up
from there, depending on the view.

1338
01:43:46,012 --> 01:43:47,206
That's beautiful.

1339
01:43:47,380 --> 01:43:51,783
So, what if I told you
that a 20-story office building...

1340
01:43:51,952 --> 01:43:53,681
...was going up where my club is?

1341
01:43:55,055 --> 01:43:56,454
That would block his view.

1342
01:43:56,623 --> 01:43:59,114
- Ten stories would block his view.
- Yeah. Gone.

1343
01:43:59,326 --> 01:44:03,057
The way I see it, your beautiful
million-dollar ocean and city views...

1344
01:44:03,230 --> 01:44:05,289
...are just gonna vanish into thin air.

1345
01:44:05,465 --> 01:44:06,557
- Vanish.
- Yeah.

1346
01:44:06,733 --> 01:44:10,328
Because tomorrow I am going to
sell my club to this developer...

1347
01:44:10,504 --> 01:44:14,634
...and his 20 stories are gonna be well
underway by the time you start selling.

1348
01:44:14,808 --> 01:44:16,833
- Trying to sell.
- Yeah. Right.

1349
01:44:17,010 --> 01:44:20,070
And so I think that we should talk.

1350
01:44:20,881 --> 01:44:21,973
I'd listen to her.

1351
01:44:38,999 --> 01:44:41,524
We're gonna have to
auction off everything.

1352
01:44:41,701 --> 01:44:43,601
Anything you want me to
keep for you?

1353
01:44:43,770 --> 01:44:45,067
No.

1354
01:44:45,572 --> 01:44:48,234
I just wanna try and do what's best
for both of us.

1355
01:44:49,676 --> 01:44:51,303
You gonna shoot me? Please?

1356
01:44:51,511 --> 01:44:53,604
No. I'm gonna buy you out.

1357
01:44:53,780 --> 01:44:55,611
In the next 24 hours?

1358
01:44:55,849 --> 01:44:58,613
No, in the next 24 seconds.

1359
01:45:07,894 --> 01:45:09,088
Where did you get this?

1360
01:45:09,863 --> 01:45:10,921
Thin air.

1361
01:45:12,933 --> 01:45:14,127
Oh, baby.

1362
01:45:16,503 --> 01:45:17,970
Thank you.

1363
01:45:23,577 --> 01:45:25,442
Just put it out in the universe.

1364
01:45:38,592 --> 01:45:41,561
What would really
make me so happy...

1365
01:45:42,462 --> 01:45:43,793
...is to hear from you...

1366
01:45:44,030 --> 01:45:47,966
...a great, big, giant, fat:

1367
01:45:48,134 --> 01:45:49,692
"Thank you, Ali."

1368
01:46:05,285 --> 01:46:08,220
I didn't sleep with Vince,
I just said that to hurt you.

1369
01:46:10,790 --> 01:46:11,916
I crossed the line.

1370
01:46:12,292 --> 01:46:13,316
You think?

1371
01:46:16,329 --> 01:46:17,921
I wanna come home.

1372
01:46:22,569 --> 01:46:24,002
Okay, you're home.

1373
01:46:25,338 --> 01:46:28,865
Now get your ass upstairs and
get ready, you're on in 20 minutes.

1374
01:46:32,312 --> 01:46:35,645
And if you ever pull half of the crap
that she pulled...

1375
01:46:35,815 --> 01:46:39,342
...you are gonna be out so quick
it's gonna make your head spin.

1376
01:46:39,519 --> 01:46:41,146
Yes, ma'am.

1377
01:46:43,390 --> 01:46:46,416
And don't ever
call me "ma'am" again.

1378
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:49,258
I'm gonna go get dressed
for the show.

1379
01:46:52,532 --> 01:46:54,193
Thank you, Ali.

1380
01:47:02,142 --> 01:47:04,872
So this is what happens
when you get a little money?

1381
01:47:05,045 --> 01:47:06,512
You stop doing manual labor.

1382
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:08,648
I'm back there with broken zippers...

1383
01:47:08,815 --> 01:47:11,613
...and ostrich feather fans
that won't open or close.

1384
01:47:11,785 --> 01:47:14,151
You have no idea what it's like.
No idea.

1385
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:16,584
I quit. Quit.

1386
01:48:04,370 --> 01:48:07,897
- Can I use this?
- Don't touch my stuff.

1387
01:48:19,753 --> 01:48:21,311
I've been looking for you.

1388
01:48:24,124 --> 01:48:25,557
Well, you found me.

1389
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:27,954
I wanna talk to you.

1390
01:48:28,128 --> 01:48:29,561
I really have to get ready.

1391
01:48:29,729 --> 01:48:32,163
I know I messed up, okay? Big-time.

1392
01:48:32,332 --> 01:48:35,563
When? When you lied to me
about your engagement being over...

1393
01:48:35,735 --> 01:48:37,930
...or when you kicked me out?

1394
01:48:38,104 --> 01:48:40,504
It really was over. Okay?
And she's gone.

1395
01:48:42,308 --> 01:48:44,503
I'm here to apologize.

1396
01:48:47,847 --> 01:48:49,508
No, no. Hey.

1397
01:48:51,117 --> 01:48:54,553
I never should have let you
walk out that door.

1398
01:48:58,158 --> 01:48:59,455
Go on.

1399
01:49:00,026 --> 01:49:01,789
I want you to come back.

1400
01:49:09,235 --> 01:49:11,965
So, what's the proposal, exactly?

1401
01:49:16,176 --> 01:49:17,507
Well...

1402
01:49:18,011 --> 01:49:20,536
...I still have that full box of cookies.

1403
01:49:21,981 --> 01:49:23,608
And an empty day bed.

1404
01:49:25,351 --> 01:49:26,978
I want the bedroom.

1405
01:49:29,522 --> 01:49:30,682
Half.

1406
01:49:34,127 --> 01:49:37,255
So are you in or are you out?

1407
01:49:37,997 --> 01:49:39,589
Oh, Jack. Now, see...

1408
01:49:40,133 --> 01:49:45,332
...I'm the kind of girl that,
when a friend's in trouble, I help.

1409
01:49:45,505 --> 01:49:47,200
That's just who I am.

1410
01:49:47,373 --> 01:49:48,635
Shut up.

1411
01:50:11,664 --> 01:50:13,495
Okay, then. All right.

1412
01:50:17,670 --> 01:50:19,160
I...

1413
01:50:20,440 --> 01:50:21,907
I finished a song.

1414
01:50:22,609 --> 01:50:24,406
I think it's pretty good.

1415
01:50:27,113 --> 01:50:29,411
- Can I hear it?
- No.

1416
01:50:35,255 --> 01:50:36,950
But you can sing it.

1417
01:50:46,099 --> 01:50:48,829
Underneath the city lights

1418
01:50:49,936 --> 01:50:53,929
There is a world few know about

1419
01:50:54,440 --> 01:50:58,501
Where rules don't apply, no

1420
01:50:59,145 --> 01:51:05,550
And you can't keep a good girl down

1421
01:51:27,907 --> 01:51:29,499
Baby doll just come to life

1422
01:51:30,109 --> 01:51:32,134
Under the spotlight

1423
01:51:32,312 --> 01:51:34,371
All the girls wanna fall in line

1424
01:51:34,547 --> 01:51:37,414
We say hey

1425
01:51:37,583 --> 01:51:39,949
Here come the ladies
'Bout to give a little show

1426
01:51:40,119 --> 01:51:42,144
Hey

1427
01:51:42,322 --> 01:51:44,415
Here go the boys
They're gonna show a little more

1428
01:51:46,759 --> 01:51:48,920
Hit it up, get it up
Won't let you rest

1429
01:51:49,095 --> 01:51:51,256
Hit it up, get it up
This is not a test

1430
01:51:51,431 --> 01:51:53,422
Hit it up, get it up
Gotta give me your best

1431
01:51:53,599 --> 01:51:55,658
So get your ass up
Show me how you burlesque
