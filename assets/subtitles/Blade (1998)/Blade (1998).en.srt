1
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,041
Policefound her in the street.
Looks like she was bitten.

2
00:01:04,542 --> 00:01:05,626
Some kind of an animal.

3
00:01:06,043 --> 00:01:07,586
WOAAN: Jesus!
Her water's broken!

4
00:01:08,045 --> 00:01:09,672
She's going into
uterine contractions!

5
00:01:10,089 --> 00:01:12,091
We'll have to do
a C-section!

6
00:02:10,274 --> 00:02:11,400
What you got down there,
little man?

7
00:02:11,901 --> 00:02:13,152
Oh, that's
my heat seeker.

8
00:02:13,611 --> 00:02:15,196
I'll bet this.

9
00:02:18,324 --> 00:02:19,366
So, where are we going?

10
00:02:19,867 --> 00:02:21,118
It's a surprise,
baby.

11
00:02:21,577 --> 00:02:22,912
Yeah, I like surprises.

12
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,831
Yeah.

13
00:02:28,334 --> 00:02:31,086
Whoo!
Oh, my God!

14
00:02:31,545 --> 00:02:34,173
What the fuck
are we doing here?

15
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:38,177
Whoo! Look at all that.

16
00:02:41,388 --> 00:02:43,307
What the fuck is that?

17
00:02:53,275 --> 00:02:55,236
What did you just say?

18
00:03:49,456 --> 00:03:51,458
Whoo! Hey, what's up?

19
00:04:04,346 --> 00:04:05,848
All right.

20
00:04:06,265 --> 00:04:08,058
Ha ha ha!

21
00:04:12,688 --> 00:04:14,022
Yeah.

22
00:04:30,581 --> 00:04:32,416
What's happening?

23
00:04:40,758 --> 00:04:42,426
Man.

24
00:04:47,848 --> 00:04:48,849
Fuck.

25
00:04:58,692 --> 00:05:02,029
Fuck. I need a drink.

26
00:05:49,284 --> 00:05:51,078
No! No!

27
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,585
What's wrong, baby?

28
00:06:09,263 --> 00:06:10,264
Ha ha ha!

29
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,976
Is that him?

30
00:06:56,393 --> 00:06:57,853
Jesus, that's him.

31
00:06:58,311 --> 00:07:01,106
It's Blade.
It's the daywalker.

32
00:07:22,377 --> 00:07:24,337
Come on, daywalker!

33
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:46,985
Hey! I'm gonna rip
your fucking head off!

34
00:08:41,498 --> 00:08:44,084
That's him!
That's him! Get him!

35
00:08:44,501 --> 00:08:45,335
Fuck him up!

36
00:08:45,835 --> 00:08:48,505
We're gonna jack you up.
Aake him hurt bad.

37
00:09:54,446 --> 00:09:56,906
Quinn...

38
00:09:57,407 --> 00:10:00,493
I'm getting a Little tired
of chopping you up.

39
00:10:05,123 --> 00:10:08,543
Thought I might try fire
for a change.

40
00:10:11,546 --> 00:10:13,465
Give my regards to Frost.

41
00:10:16,718 --> 00:10:19,012
No! Please don't!

42
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:34,778
Put him out.

43
00:10:35,236 --> 00:10:37,197
Yes, sir.
Paramedics.

44
00:10:59,886 --> 00:11:03,097
Got a charred cadaver here
for you. Still warm, too.

45
00:11:03,598 --> 00:11:05,183
1, 2, 3.

46
00:11:10,188 --> 00:11:12,607
Oh, Jesus, that's rank.

47
00:11:13,024 --> 00:11:15,068
Paramedics said
he was still screaming

48
00:11:15,568 --> 00:11:18,905
when they found him
stapled to a wall.

49
00:11:19,364 --> 00:11:21,241
That's very pretty.

50
00:11:34,337 --> 00:11:35,338
CURTIS: Did you check
the chem count?

51
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,382
His  sugar's
3times norm,

52
00:11:37,882 --> 00:11:39,259
phosphorus and uric acid
are off the charts.

53
00:11:39,676 --> 00:11:42,804
KAREN: You took this
off a D.O.A.?

54
00:11:43,304 --> 00:11:45,139
Yeah.

55
00:11:45,557 --> 00:11:47,350
But this doesn't
make any sense.

56
00:11:50,353 --> 00:11:51,813
The red blood cells
are biconvex,

57
00:11:52,313 --> 00:11:53,398
which is impossible.

58
00:11:53,856 --> 00:11:57,110
Look at the polys.
They're binucleated.

59
00:12:00,154 --> 00:12:03,157
OK, Curtis, it's3.00
in the morning--

60
00:12:03,658 --> 00:12:04,659
This is not a joke.

61
00:12:05,076 --> 00:12:08,204
I've got the body sitting
in the morgue right now.

62
00:12:08,705 --> 00:12:11,207
I thought you promised
to give me some distance.

63
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:14,335
I just wantyouto come down
andtake a Look.

64
00:12:20,925 --> 00:12:24,137
OK. Show me the body.

65
00:12:24,596 --> 00:12:26,848
And I don't want to hear
a word aboutus.

66
00:12:27,265 --> 00:12:29,851
Done.We've had
that conversation.

67
00:12:33,688 --> 00:12:35,606
You haven'tstarted on
the internal organs yet?

68
00:12:36,107 --> 00:12:38,776
Justa blood sample
through the pericardium.

69
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:43,656
The maxilla Looks
a Little deformed.

70
00:12:44,157 --> 00:12:46,451
There's some odd muscle
structure aroundthe canines.

71
00:12:46,909 --> 00:12:47,869
I'm going
to start the "Y"

72
00:12:48,369 --> 00:12:49,746
and check
the tracheal mucosa.

73
00:12:54,876 --> 00:12:57,754
Letme ask you
something.

74
00:12:58,171 --> 00:12:59,756
Honestly...

75
00:13:00,214 --> 00:13:01,591
you ever have second
thoughts aboutus?

76
00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:06,679
Sometimes.

77
00:13:08,765 --> 00:13:10,641
But then I remember how much
of an asshole you were.

78
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:12,143
Want to cutme
some slackhere?

79
00:13:12,643 --> 00:13:15,021
You asked for some time off,
I gave you some time off.

80
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,064
Look, Curtis--

81
00:13:16,522 --> 00:13:17,690
I'm trying.

82
00:13:18,149 --> 00:13:19,108
It's over.

83
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:31,162
Yaah!

84
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:38,252
Aah!

85
00:13:38,669 --> 00:13:40,630
Call security!

86
00:13:55,103 --> 00:13:55,937
Aah!

87
00:13:56,437 --> 00:13:57,772
Came back
to finish you off.

88
00:13:58,189 --> 00:14:00,233
Get out of my way,
youfreak!

89
00:14:07,156 --> 00:14:08,825
Freeze!

90
00:14:10,493 --> 00:14:13,704
Motherfucker, are you
out of your damn mind?!

91
00:14:14,163 --> 00:14:15,123
Aah!
Aah!

92
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:19,669
Yaah!

93
00:14:24,298 --> 00:14:25,633
Aah!

94
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:07,300
Hey, you! Freeze!

95
00:15:17,893 --> 00:15:18,811
Aah!

96
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:19,854
Aah!

97
00:15:20,313 --> 00:15:22,148
Aah!

98
00:15:25,818 --> 00:15:26,444
Freeze!

99
00:15:26,902 --> 00:15:28,779
Hold it right there!

100
00:15:37,413 --> 00:15:39,415
Aah! Aah!

101
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,212
Ay shoulder.

102
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,882
It's dislocated.

103
00:15:50,635 --> 00:15:52,345
Aah!

104
00:15:59,185 --> 00:16:00,186
Uhh!

105
00:17:37,324 --> 00:17:38,284
BLADE: Whistler.

106
00:17:41,704 --> 00:17:43,497
Whistler.

107
00:17:49,545 --> 00:17:51,255
Bringing home
strays now?

108
00:17:53,716 --> 00:17:55,009
She's been bitten.

109
00:17:59,513 --> 00:18:00,723
Should've
killed her, then.

110
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:02,725
Yeah, I know.

111
00:18:05,269 --> 00:18:06,770
But I didn't.

112
00:18:13,611 --> 00:18:15,529
You watch her close.

113
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,782
If she starts to turn,
You finish her off.

114
00:18:22,578 --> 00:18:24,371
Or I wlll.

115
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:28,334
Uhh.

116
00:18:31,587 --> 00:18:33,339
She's borderLine.

117
00:18:35,007 --> 00:18:38,802
Another hour, she'd be
well into the change.

118
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:41,680
Dr Karen Jenson,

119
00:18:42,097 --> 00:18:43,849
Listen close.

120
00:18:44,266 --> 00:18:46,185
I'm Going to inject you
withAllium sativum--

121
00:18:46,685 --> 00:18:48,103
garlic.

122
00:18:48,604 --> 00:18:50,439
This is going
to hurt--a Lot.

123
00:18:50,939 --> 00:18:52,733
It was Quinn.

124
00:18:53,192 --> 00:18:55,152
Frost's Little
errand boy?

125
00:18:55,569 --> 00:18:57,237
You get
a lead on him?

126
00:18:57,655 --> 00:18:58,322
No.

127
00:18:58,822 --> 00:19:01,367
Too bad.

128
00:19:03,035 --> 00:19:03,619
Uhh!

129
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:05,162
Hold her.

130
00:19:16,131 --> 00:19:18,050
I give herfifty-fifty

131
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:22,054
if she makes it
through the night.

132
00:19:47,204 --> 00:19:48,705
Blade...

133
00:19:49,164 --> 00:19:50,791
the daywalker--

134
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,294
still pursuing
his ridiculous crusade.

135
00:19:57,297 --> 00:19:59,174
How many died?

136
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:01,677
We don't have
an exact count.

137
00:20:02,177 --> 00:20:04,012
Apparently, he used
a Lot of sliver.

138
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:05,639
We're having
difficulty--

139
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,516
Send in Frost.

140
00:20:16,441 --> 00:20:17,442
Deacon Frost.

141
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:23,866
You can come in now.

142
00:20:56,982 --> 00:20:58,942
These nightclubs of yours
are dangerous.

143
00:20:59,401 --> 00:21:00,861
Are they?

144
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:03,739
They draw needless
attention to our kind.

145
00:21:04,239 --> 00:21:04,990
You know our policy.

146
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,242
Your policy,
notmine.

147
00:21:07,659 --> 00:21:09,369
Our livelihood...

148
00:21:09,786 --> 00:21:14,666
depends on our abllity
to blend in

149
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,085
and our discretion.

150
00:21:17,586 --> 00:21:20,881
Aaybe it's time we forgot
about discretion.

151
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:22,758
We Should be ruling
the humans,

152
00:21:23,216 --> 00:21:23,926
not running around

153
00:21:24,426 --> 00:21:25,802
making back-alley treaties
with them.

154
00:21:26,219 --> 00:21:28,263
For fuck's sake,
these people are our food,

155
00:21:28,764 --> 00:21:29,306
not our allies.

156
00:21:29,806 --> 00:21:30,807
You're out of Line, Frost.

157
00:21:31,224 --> 00:21:32,643
Am I?

158
00:21:33,101 --> 00:21:34,519
Or maybe I'm just
The first to say outloud

159
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,063
what we've
all been thinking.

160
00:21:36,521 --> 00:21:37,981
We have existed this way

161
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:40,776
for thousands of years.

162
00:21:41,234 --> 00:21:41,818
Who are you

163
00:21:42,235 --> 00:21:45,614
to challenge our ways?

164
00:21:46,114 --> 00:21:48,241
You're not even
a pureblood.

165
00:21:51,703 --> 00:21:52,996
Like itmatters.

166
00:21:54,331 --> 00:21:57,709
I was born a vampire,

167
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:01,380
as was every other member
of this house,

168
00:22:01,797 --> 00:22:03,090
butyou, Frost...

169
00:22:06,593 --> 00:22:09,096
you were merely turned.

170
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:12,849
The world belongs to us,

171
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,310
not the humans.

172
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:17,062
You know that.

173
00:22:21,817 --> 00:22:24,152
Do we have any other
business to discuss?

174
00:22:24,653 --> 00:22:26,780
Well, uh...

175
00:22:27,197 --> 00:22:28,740
there's the matter of
our offshore accounts.

176
00:22:29,157 --> 00:22:29,950
We're having
difficulty--

177
00:22:30,409 --> 00:22:31,201
And have you made
the transfer to the--

178
00:22:31,702 --> 00:22:32,703
Gitano...

179
00:22:33,161 --> 00:22:37,082
you may wake upone day
and find yourself extinct.

180
00:23:10,282 --> 00:23:11,241
You're a week early.

181
00:23:11,741 --> 00:23:13,118
Yeah.

182
00:23:20,584 --> 00:23:23,086
Whistler says I'm building up
a resistance to the serum.

183
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:28,925
Yeah, I figured
that might happen.

184
00:23:37,893 --> 00:23:40,562
You take care, all right?

185
00:25:24,457 --> 00:25:26,835
I must be getting
softin my old age,

186
00:25:27,293 --> 00:25:30,213
Letting you bring home
a stray like that.

187
00:25:30,672 --> 00:25:32,882
It was damn stupid of you.

188
00:25:33,341 --> 00:25:35,301
Aight've Lucked out,
though.

189
00:25:36,553 --> 00:25:39,055
I checked her background.

190
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:44,686
It turns out
she's a haematologist.

191
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:48,773
She mightbe usefulto us.

192
00:25:49,274 --> 00:25:50,650
I doubt it.

193
00:25:52,235 --> 00:25:53,695
I'm serious.

194
00:25:54,154 --> 00:25:55,655
I took a Look
at that notebook of hers.

195
00:25:56,072 --> 00:25:58,199
She's onto something.

196
00:26:00,243 --> 00:26:02,412
I hadto increase
the dose.

197
00:26:03,997 --> 00:26:05,748
It's over
50 milligrams now.

198
00:26:06,166 --> 00:26:07,125
That's getting
dangerous.

199
00:26:07,625 --> 00:26:08,710
Just do it,

200
00:26:09,127 --> 00:26:10,879
old man.

201
00:26:12,005 --> 00:26:13,840
Ahh.

202
00:26:24,017 --> 00:26:25,226
Uhh...

203
00:27:11,231 --> 00:27:13,441
Wander off
the beaten path, Doctor?

204
00:27:15,443 --> 00:27:16,736
Who are you people?

205
00:27:17,195 --> 00:27:18,279
Ay name's
Abraham Whistler.

206
00:27:20,073 --> 00:27:21,366
You've met Blade.

207
00:27:37,548 --> 00:27:39,008
So, am I
a prisoner here?

208
00:27:41,052 --> 00:27:42,637
Notatall.

209
00:27:43,096 --> 00:27:44,305
We just had to take
certain precautions

210
00:27:44,764 --> 00:27:46,724
before we Let you go.

211
00:27:47,183 --> 00:27:48,851
You got to understand,

212
00:27:49,352 --> 00:27:50,311
they're everywhere.

213
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:52,563
Vampires

214
00:27:52,981 --> 00:27:54,440
the Hominus nocturna.

215
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,026
We hunt them, you see

216
00:27:57,527 --> 00:27:59,112
movingfrom one city
to the next

217
00:27:59,612 --> 00:28:00,780
tracking
their migrations.

218
00:28:01,239 --> 00:28:02,365
They're hardto kill.

219
00:28:02,865 --> 00:28:04,242
They tendto regenerate.

220
00:28:04,742 --> 00:28:05,827
And I'm supposed
to beLleve allthis?

221
00:28:06,244 --> 00:28:09,288
Well, you already met
Ar Crispy at the hospital.

222
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:11,082
What do youthink?

223
00:28:13,167 --> 00:28:14,669
So, what do you use, then?

224
00:28:15,169 --> 00:28:16,838
Stakes? Crosses?

225
00:28:17,296 --> 00:28:18,756
Crosses don't do squat.

226
00:28:19,257 --> 00:28:21,884
Some of the Legends
are true, though.

227
00:28:22,343 --> 00:28:25,179
Vampires are severely
allergic to sliver.

228
00:28:25,596 --> 00:28:27,181
Feed them garlic,

229
00:28:27,598 --> 00:28:28,683
and they go into
anaphylactic shock.

230
00:28:29,183 --> 00:28:30,685
Then, of course,
there's always sunLight,

231
00:28:31,185 --> 00:28:32,603
ultraviolet rays.

232
00:28:33,104 --> 00:28:35,732
I got this sucker
running.

233
00:28:36,232 --> 00:28:38,317
Youwant to give it
a try tonight?

234
00:28:44,323 --> 00:28:45,408
It's still heavy.

235
00:28:46,993 --> 00:28:48,161
Well, you're so big.

236
00:28:50,705 --> 00:28:51,873
If you want to Live
to see another day,

237
00:28:52,331 --> 00:28:53,833
you'll be out of town
by nightfall.

238
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:56,252
So where am I
Supposed to go?

239
00:28:59,714 --> 00:29:02,216
You've been exposed to them.

240
00:29:02,717 --> 00:29:06,053
One way or another, somebody's
Going to take you out.

241
00:29:10,516 --> 00:29:13,394
There's a war going on
out there.

242
00:29:13,895 --> 00:29:16,314
Blade, myself,
a few others,

243
00:29:16,773 --> 00:29:17,690
we've triedto keepit
from spllLlng over

244
00:29:18,191 --> 00:29:18,775
onto the streets.

245
00:29:20,401 --> 00:29:21,402
Sometimes,
people like yourself

246
00:29:21,819 --> 00:29:24,280
get caught
in the crossfire.

247
00:29:24,697 --> 00:29:26,741
I have blood samples.
I can go to the police.

248
00:29:27,241 --> 00:29:29,660
They own the police.

249
00:29:30,161 --> 00:29:31,537
You have to understand,
they're everywhere.

250
00:29:31,996 --> 00:29:33,873
Chances are you've
seen them yourself

251
00:29:34,373 --> 00:29:34,957
and didn't know it--

252
00:29:35,458 --> 00:29:37,251
on the subway
or in a bar.

253
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,756
So that's it?

254
00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:45,218
You guys just patch me up
and send me on my way?

255
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:50,723
Here.

256
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,517
Vampire mace...

257
00:29:54,101 --> 00:29:55,770
sliver nitrate,
essence of garlic.

258
00:29:56,187 --> 00:29:58,397
You keep your eyes open.

259
00:29:58,898 --> 00:30:00,775
Be careful.

260
00:30:04,987 --> 00:30:06,280
One other thing...

261
00:30:07,532 --> 00:30:09,825
buy yourself a gun.

262
00:30:10,284 --> 00:30:13,871
If you start getting
sensitive to day light...

263
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:16,082
if you find
you're thirsty

264
00:30:16,499 --> 00:30:19,335
regardless of how much
you had to drink,

265
00:30:19,752 --> 00:30:20,836
then I suggest
you take that gun

266
00:30:21,337 --> 00:30:23,881
and use it on yourself.

267
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:29,095
Better that
than the alternative.

268
00:31:27,028 --> 00:31:28,779
You have been warned
before.

269
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,322
These archives
are restricted

270
00:31:30,781 --> 00:31:33,784
to members
of the House of Erebus.

271
00:31:35,953 --> 00:31:37,580
You are wasting your time.

272
00:31:37,997 --> 00:31:39,665
It's a dead Language.

273
00:31:40,082 --> 00:31:43,878
The ancient texts
can never be translated.

274
00:31:44,295 --> 00:31:47,131
You wouldn't even
Understand them.

275
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:50,176
Damn it, Frost!

276
00:31:50,676 --> 00:31:51,761
I'm talking to you!

277
00:31:53,137 --> 00:31:55,389
Shh.

278
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:58,267
Keep your voice down,
Gitano.

279
00:32:00,394 --> 00:32:01,520
We're in a library.

280
00:32:02,021 --> 00:32:03,022
You don’t need
to shout.

281
00:32:04,482 --> 00:32:07,359
What are you up to,
Frost?

282
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:21,081
What are you
Going to do, hmm?

283
00:32:25,669 --> 00:32:26,670
What?

284
00:32:32,259 --> 00:32:33,761
You bore me.

285
00:33:02,331 --> 00:33:04,041
Hey!

286
00:33:08,796 --> 00:33:11,298
BLADE: Remember
what we told you.

287
00:33:11,715 --> 00:33:13,551
You keepyour eyes open.

288
00:33:14,009 --> 00:33:14,635
They're everywhere.

289
00:33:16,845 --> 00:33:18,472
Butit's daytime!

290
00:33:58,679 --> 00:33:59,847
[Elevator bell dings]

291
00:34:18,365 --> 00:34:19,575
How you doing?

292
00:35:38,195 --> 00:35:39,822
Hithere. Hey.

293
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:40,906
I'm sorry. Whoa, whoa!

294
00:35:41,323 --> 00:35:42,783
Whoa. Hold on,
Hold on, Hold on.

295
00:35:43,242 --> 00:35:43,826
Police officer.

296
00:35:44,284 --> 00:35:45,118
I'm sorry, OK?

297
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,662
Police officer. I didn't
mean to scare you.

298
00:35:47,162 --> 00:35:47,746
The front door was open.

299
00:35:48,247 --> 00:35:48,914
What are you doing in here?

300
00:35:49,373 --> 00:35:52,209
I'm just here
on a routine check.

301
00:35:52,626 --> 00:35:53,794
Look, I'm--
I'm Officer Krieger,

302
00:35:54,294 --> 00:35:55,295
42nd precinct.

303
00:35:55,712 --> 00:35:58,298
You're Karen Jenson,
right?

304
00:35:58,715 --> 00:36:00,050
Yeah.

305
00:36:00,551 --> 00:36:01,760
Your co-workers
at the hospital

306
00:36:02,261 --> 00:36:05,389
said that you were
kidnapped last night.

307
00:36:05,806 --> 00:36:06,849
Are you OK?

308
00:36:07,349 --> 00:36:10,435
KAREN: What happened to
the other doctor I was with?

309
00:36:12,104 --> 00:36:12,938
Curtis Webb?

310
00:36:13,438 --> 00:36:14,898
Um, he died.

311
00:36:16,233 --> 00:36:16,942
No, Look,

312
00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:18,569
don't worry about that
right now, OK?

313
00:36:19,027 --> 00:36:20,612
Why?

314
00:36:21,071 --> 00:36:24,241
Because you're dead,
too, you bitch.

315
00:36:24,741 --> 00:36:25,909
Aah!

316
00:36:27,661 --> 00:36:28,704
Bitch!
What is it?

317
00:36:32,249 --> 00:36:33,125
What is this, garlic?

318
00:36:33,584 --> 00:36:35,836
Yeah. He said it would
work againstvampires.

319
00:36:36,295 --> 00:36:37,713
Vampires?

320
00:36:38,922 --> 00:36:41,133
Who said I was
a vampire, huh?

321
00:36:43,176 --> 00:36:44,428
Nobody.

322
00:36:49,433 --> 00:36:51,560
He's afamlliar

323
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,687
a vampire wannabe.

324
00:36:54,187 --> 00:36:56,857
If he's loyal enough

325
00:36:57,357 --> 00:37:01,820
and he proves himself, maybe
his master wlllturn him.

326
00:37:02,321 --> 00:37:04,323
Wait a minute.
You used me as bait?

327
00:37:04,781 --> 00:37:06,575
Get over it.

328
00:37:11,163 --> 00:37:12,205
Is all that necessary?

329
00:37:17,169 --> 00:37:19,046
BLADE: That's a glyph--

330
00:37:19,546 --> 00:37:20,714
a vampire cattle brand.

331
00:37:21,131 --> 00:37:23,675
It means that Officer Krieger
is somebody's property.

332
00:37:24,134 --> 00:37:25,802
Another vampire tries
to bleed this Little hooker,

333
00:37:26,219 --> 00:37:28,680
then they have to answer
to his owner.

334
00:37:30,515 --> 00:37:32,351
Deacon Frost.

335
00:37:32,851 --> 00:37:34,853
We've been tracking him
for a long time.

336
00:37:35,312 --> 00:37:36,646
All right.

337
00:37:37,147 --> 00:37:38,357
Officer Krieger,

338
00:37:38,815 --> 00:37:41,234
you Going to be a good
Little bloodhound, huh?

339
00:37:41,693 --> 00:37:43,195
Tell us what your master's
been up to.

340
00:37:43,612 --> 00:37:44,321
Oh, great,
now you're robbing him.

341
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,822
You going
to robme, too?

342
00:37:46,323 --> 00:37:48,950
How do you think that we
Fund this organization, huh?

343
00:37:49,451 --> 00:37:52,913
We're not exactly
the Aarch of Dimes.

344
00:37:54,873 --> 00:37:56,333
It's fake.

345
00:37:59,086 --> 00:38:00,170
Well...

346
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:03,340
Looks like our friend here
has been blood running, huh?

347
00:38:03,799 --> 00:38:04,925
Hlllbarn CLlnic.

348
00:38:05,425 --> 00:38:06,468
I know this place.
It's a blood bank.

349
00:38:06,927 --> 00:38:07,761
Owned by vampires,

350
00:38:08,178 --> 00:38:09,179
and there's one
in every city.

351
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:10,764
And they always deliver.

352
00:38:11,223 --> 00:38:12,599
So, where were you
taking it?

353
00:38:13,058 --> 00:38:14,434
I don't know what
you're talking--aah!

354
00:38:14,935 --> 00:38:15,519
Ooh!

355
00:38:15,977 --> 00:38:17,854
Look, take it easy.

356
00:38:18,271 --> 00:38:20,023
I'm only Going to ask you
one more time.

357
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,734
Where were you taking it?

358
00:38:23,193 --> 00:38:24,402
Go fuck yourself.

359
00:38:24,903 --> 00:38:26,321
Fuckme?
No, you fuck this.

360
00:38:43,797 --> 00:38:45,549
You better wake up.

361
00:38:46,007 --> 00:38:48,802
The world you Live in is
Just a sugar-coated topping.

362
00:38:49,302 --> 00:38:51,388
There is another world
beneath it--

363
00:38:51,805 --> 00:38:52,597
the real world.

364
00:38:53,014 --> 00:38:53,807
And if you want
to survive it,

365
00:38:54,307 --> 00:38:57,185
you better learn
to pullthe trigger.

366
00:39:00,355 --> 00:39:01,898
Wait a minute.

367
00:39:02,399 --> 00:39:02,941
I'm comingwith you.

368
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:04,442
You're useless.

369
00:39:08,071 --> 00:39:10,365
I have to stick with you.

370
00:39:10,866 --> 00:39:12,742
It's the only way that
I'll stay alive long enough

371
00:39:13,159 --> 00:39:14,870
to find a cure for myself.

372
00:39:15,287 --> 00:39:17,205
There is no cure.

373
00:39:25,881 --> 00:39:28,508
He's not going
to come back.

374
00:39:29,759 --> 00:39:31,303
Nobody's that’s stupid.

375
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,556
When you understand
the nature of a thing,

376
00:39:35,056 --> 00:39:36,725
you know what
it's capable of.

377
00:39:54,784 --> 00:39:55,410
It's Krieger.

378
00:39:55,869 --> 00:39:56,703
I'm at 16-0-0-9.

379
00:39:57,162 --> 00:39:57,996
Yes?

380
00:39:58,496 --> 00:39:59,581
Get me through.

381
00:40:03,293 --> 00:40:05,378
I got a delivery
in progress here,

382
00:40:05,879 --> 00:40:07,130
and I just had a run-in
with Blade.

383
00:40:13,637 --> 00:40:16,181
I got to clear out
that clinic on Hlllbarn now!

384
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:39,204
Looks like
we hitpay dirt.

385
00:40:39,662 --> 00:40:41,164
That's a vampire mark.

386
00:40:41,623 --> 00:40:42,415
It means that
there's a safe house

387
00:40:42,832 --> 00:40:43,958
around here somewhere--

388
00:40:44,459 --> 00:40:46,961
a place they can go
with donors coming.

389
00:40:47,462 --> 00:40:49,297
See the valets
over there?

390
00:40:49,756 --> 00:40:50,882
They're vampires.

391
00:40:51,383 --> 00:40:53,468
So is the doorman

392
00:40:53,927 --> 00:40:56,429
and the whore
on the corner.

393
00:40:56,888 --> 00:40:58,181
How can you tell?

394
00:40:58,681 --> 00:41:00,392
By the way they move...

395
00:41:00,892 --> 00:41:01,893
the way they smell.

396
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:03,311
Psst.

397
00:41:06,356 --> 00:41:08,024
It's like a bad dream.

398
00:41:08,441 --> 00:41:10,443
There are worse things
out tonight than vampires.

399
00:41:10,944 --> 00:41:11,778
Like what?

400
00:41:12,237 --> 00:41:13,571
Like me.

401
00:41:15,281 --> 00:41:17,075
OK, Vampire Anatomy 101.

402
00:41:17,492 --> 00:41:18,827
Crosses and holy water
don't do dick,

403
00:41:19,285 --> 00:41:20,787
so forget what you've seen
in the movies.

404
00:41:21,287 --> 00:41:23,164
You use a stake, sliver,
or sun light.

405
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:25,208
You know how to use
one of these?

406
00:41:25,625 --> 00:41:26,334
Nope...

407
00:41:26,793 --> 00:41:28,211
but I'll damn sure
learn quick.

408
00:41:28,628 --> 00:41:29,796
The safety's off,
rounds already chambered--

409
00:41:30,296 --> 00:41:31,131
sliver hollow point
filled with garlic.

410
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:32,757
You aim for the head
or the heart.

411
00:41:33,258 --> 00:41:34,759
Anything else is your ass.

412
00:41:37,303 --> 00:41:38,763
Do you have
an invitation?

413
00:42:09,544 --> 00:42:10,837
What you got?

414
00:42:27,979 --> 00:42:29,397
Kenji!

415
00:42:43,161 --> 00:42:44,412
Ohh!

416
00:42:44,871 --> 00:42:45,872
Where's the entrance?

417
00:42:46,372 --> 00:42:47,040
I can't tell you
that, man.

418
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:49,000
Uhh!

419
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:52,879
I'm Going to ask you
one more time.

420
00:42:53,296 --> 00:42:54,797
Where's the entrance?

421
00:42:55,214 --> 00:42:57,050
OK. OK.

422
00:42:58,176 --> 00:43:00,136
It's in the freezer.

423
00:43:09,395 --> 00:43:10,647
Come on, man!
I told you!

424
00:43:11,147 --> 00:43:13,149
It's in the fridge!

425
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:22,367
OK.

426
00:43:22,784 --> 00:43:24,619
You give Frost
a message from me.

427
00:43:25,078 --> 00:43:27,288
You tell him it's
open season on suckheads.

428
00:44:10,081 --> 00:44:12,667
Some kind of archive.

429
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:18,714
This must be where they keep
most of their records.

430
00:44:19,215 --> 00:44:20,925
Isn't this just
a Little high-tech?

431
00:44:21,426 --> 00:44:23,469
They've got their claws
into everything--

432
00:44:23,886 --> 00:44:25,513
politics, finance,
real estate.

433
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:28,933
They already own
half of downtown.

434
00:44:52,248 --> 00:44:53,875
Frost throws a good party.

435
00:44:54,292 --> 00:44:55,418
Yeah...

436
00:44:55,918 --> 00:44:57,503
but where is he?

437
00:45:11,601 --> 00:45:12,810
Come on, baby.

438
00:45:22,361 --> 00:45:24,947
Don't keep everyone
waiting.

439
00:45:44,175 --> 00:45:45,176
Deacon,

440
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:48,346
there's someone here
to see you.

441
00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:53,601
I got to talk to you,
Frost.

442
00:45:54,101 --> 00:45:55,853
I'm sorry.
I had to come here.

443
00:45:56,312 --> 00:45:57,897
It's a mistake
Going to Pearl's.

444
00:45:58,356 --> 00:46:00,441
I know that.
Dumb fucking me.

445
00:46:00,942 --> 00:46:01,734
I know you're
disappointed.

446
00:46:02,234 --> 00:46:02,777
Am I that
transparent?

447
00:46:03,277 --> 00:46:03,819
You want
to meet him?

448
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:04,862
Yeah.

449
00:46:05,363 --> 00:46:06,197
I can get you guys
in with him,

450
00:46:06,614 --> 00:46:07,865
because we're tight.
We're like brothers.

451
00:46:08,366 --> 00:46:09,367
Fuck.

452
00:46:09,825 --> 00:46:10,618
Aw, fuck. Frost.

453
00:46:11,118 --> 00:46:12,119
Hey.
Yeah.

454
00:46:13,204 --> 00:46:14,664
Deac. Deac.

455
00:46:15,081 --> 00:46:16,874
I've been telling these
bitches all about you, man.

456
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:18,125
They've been dying
to meet you.

457
00:46:18,626 --> 00:46:19,251
They are so psyched.

458
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:20,753
Bad ass bitches.
They--

459
00:46:21,253 --> 00:46:22,129
Hi.

460
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:23,172
Deac?

461
00:46:23,673 --> 00:46:25,841
Frost, it's about Blade.

462
00:46:26,342 --> 00:46:27,259
Aw, he's busy, you know?

463
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,095
Because, like, when
he's focused on business...

464
00:46:29,595 --> 00:46:32,014
Look, Frost,
this is important.

465
00:46:32,515 --> 00:46:34,058
Blade was waiting for me,

466
00:46:34,558 --> 00:46:36,560
using the girl as bait.

467
00:46:37,019 --> 00:46:38,396
And you were stupid
enough to take it.

468
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:39,647
Shut up, bitch.

469
00:46:40,106 --> 00:46:41,107
I didn't know he was
Going to be there.

470
00:46:41,607 --> 00:46:42,608
It was a trap, see?

471
00:46:43,067 --> 00:46:43,943
But don't worry
About it.

472
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,028
It's no problem. We can
still get the girl.

473
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:48,823
Yeah!

474
00:46:55,621 --> 00:46:56,789
Whoo!

475
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:18,769
Forget the girl.

476
00:47:19,228 --> 00:47:20,187
I want Blade.

477
00:47:20,688 --> 00:47:22,064
I know you do.

478
00:47:22,565 --> 00:47:23,107
You hear me, Quinn?

479
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:25,526
I want him alive.

480
00:47:25,985 --> 00:47:26,944
What?

481
00:47:29,822 --> 00:47:30,698
Wait a minute, man.

482
00:47:31,115 --> 00:47:32,950
You want him alive?

483
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:37,455
KAREN: What's that smell?

484
00:47:40,416 --> 00:47:42,251
...image carefully, Frost.

485
00:47:42,751 --> 00:47:47,715
You will need 12 purebloods
to make the ritual work.

486
00:47:48,215 --> 00:47:49,717
Krieger, is thatyou?

487
00:47:50,217 --> 00:47:51,010
He--he's here!

488
00:47:51,469 --> 00:47:52,052
He's here!

489
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:53,762
This mustbe Pearl,

490
00:47:54,263 --> 00:47:54,805
the record keeper.

491
00:47:57,141 --> 00:47:58,851
He's Going to kill me!

492
00:47:59,351 --> 00:48:01,395
You need me, Frost!
You need me!

493
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:03,105
Pearl, you're history.

494
00:48:03,564 --> 00:48:05,608
Have the good grace to die
with somefuckin' dignity.

495
00:48:06,108 --> 00:48:07,443
Frost.

496
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:09,445
Ruthless bloodsucker.

497
00:48:09,862 --> 00:48:10,654
Congratulations, Blade.

498
00:48:11,113 --> 00:48:12,239
Frost.

499
00:48:12,698 --> 00:48:13,824
I hear you've
been Lookin' for me.

500
00:48:14,325 --> 00:48:14,867
I'm flattered.

501
00:48:15,367 --> 00:48:16,744
It'll pass.

502
00:48:19,246 --> 00:48:19,872
Fuck.

503
00:48:22,791 --> 00:48:23,459
What is that?

504
00:48:23,918 --> 00:48:25,961
That, biscuitboy,
is a U.V. lamp.

505
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:27,046
We're gonna play

506
00:48:27,546 --> 00:48:28,881
a Little game
of 20 questions.

507
00:48:29,298 --> 00:48:30,633
Depending on
how you answer,

508
00:48:31,091 --> 00:48:33,552
you may walk out
of here with a tan.

509
00:48:34,053 --> 00:48:34,929
What's that?

510
00:48:35,346 --> 00:48:36,764
Oh, that?
Oh, it's nothing.

511
00:48:37,223 --> 00:48:38,766
It's routine research.
Heh heh.

512
00:48:39,225 --> 00:48:41,060
Actually,
it's a video game.

513
00:48:52,321 --> 00:48:53,489
That must've hurt.

514
00:48:53,989 --> 00:48:55,532
It's a fragment,
a piece of the prophecy!

515
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:56,825
What prophecy?

516
00:48:57,326 --> 00:48:58,744
Oh, I'm not really sure.

517
00:48:59,244 --> 00:49:00,913
There are so many out--

518
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:18,639
And there is nothing you
can do about it, daywalker!

519
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:20,557
Is that so?

520
00:49:21,016 --> 00:49:23,686
Well, that's
what Frost says.

521
00:49:24,144 --> 00:49:25,354
Then you won't mind me

522
00:49:25,854 --> 00:49:28,232
borrowing this
for a while, will you?

523
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:30,234
If he moves, fry him.

524
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:34,196
What's in here?

525
00:49:34,613 --> 00:49:35,406
Nothing.
It's a--a storeroom.

526
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:36,991
But you're
wasting your time.

527
00:49:37,408 --> 00:49:39,076
There's nothing
of importance to anyone.

528
00:49:39,493 --> 00:49:41,078
Then you won't mind
if I take a peek.

529
00:49:41,495 --> 00:49:42,579
No!

530
00:50:05,269 --> 00:50:06,603
He moved.

531
00:50:37,426 --> 00:50:39,595
What is this?

532
00:50:41,221 --> 00:50:42,139
These are the pages

533
00:50:42,556 --> 00:50:44,475
from The Book
of Erebus,

534
00:50:44,933 --> 00:50:46,351
the Vampire Bible.

535
00:50:48,604 --> 00:50:51,356
It contains everything...

536
00:50:51,773 --> 00:50:53,233
their entire history.

537
00:50:54,485 --> 00:50:57,988
La Aagra mustbe
one of their Legends.

538
00:51:00,699 --> 00:51:02,826
Why is Frost
so interested in La Aagra?

539
00:51:03,327 --> 00:51:04,536
Shh!

540
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:43,283
Give me your hand.

541
00:51:46,328 --> 00:51:49,039
Do you remember me?

542
00:52:07,224 --> 00:52:08,850
Give it to him!

543
00:52:24,658 --> 00:52:25,575
Hey! Hey!

544
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:27,744
Nice one.

545
00:52:28,245 --> 00:52:28,787
Heh.

546
00:52:29,287 --> 00:52:29,997
Well, well, well.

547
00:52:30,455 --> 00:52:32,249
You took my arm, man.

548
00:52:32,666 --> 00:52:34,209
Remember?

549
00:52:34,626 --> 00:52:36,044
But it's cool.

550
00:52:36,503 --> 00:52:38,547
I gota new one.

551
00:52:40,173 --> 00:52:41,883
Think I'll ever
play piano again?

552
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:45,595
You can sLlce him,
you can dice him,

553
00:52:46,013 --> 00:52:47,681
but the Quinn man
just keeps on comin'!

554
00:52:48,098 --> 00:52:48,807
Check it out.

555
00:52:49,307 --> 00:52:51,059
I've got his pig sticker.

556
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:52,853
Ah ha ha ha--

557
00:52:53,353 --> 00:52:54,021
Ohh! Aah!

558
00:52:54,521 --> 00:52:56,898
You're a fuckup, Crease!
Ha ha ha ha!

559
00:52:58,567 --> 00:52:59,276
You're a fuckup!

560
00:52:59,776 --> 00:53:00,902
"I got his pigsticker!"

561
00:53:01,361 --> 00:53:02,112
Ohh.

562
00:53:02,612 --> 00:53:04,656
You're just
full of surprises,

563
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:06,366
ain'tyou, chief?

564
00:53:14,666 --> 00:53:16,626
Stay with me, sweetness...

565
00:53:17,127 --> 00:53:20,046
'cause I'm not finished
with you yet.

566
00:53:22,299 --> 00:53:24,092
Ah, Looky here.

567
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:27,596
Sliver.

568
00:53:28,096 --> 00:53:29,264
Nice crafts manship, huh?

569
00:53:29,723 --> 00:53:31,391
Probably cost you
a pretty penny.

570
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:35,979
Now, this here is a man
who takes his job...

571
00:53:37,397 --> 00:53:40,400
justa little too seriously,
don't you think?

572
00:53:44,654 --> 00:53:46,865
Come to think of it, Blade,

573
00:53:47,365 --> 00:53:49,034
I owe you one.

574
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:56,082
Actually, if you want
to get technical, Blade...

575
00:53:57,792 --> 00:53:59,127
I owe you two.

576
00:54:02,214 --> 00:54:04,299
Oh, what's sofunny,
bright eyes?

577
00:54:07,552 --> 00:54:09,387
I'm expecting company.

578
00:54:24,945 --> 00:54:26,821
Catch you fuckers
at a bad time?

579
00:54:27,322 --> 00:54:28,490
No! No guns!

580
00:54:30,659 --> 00:54:32,160
No! No! No!

581
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:40,252
No! Fuckin' this way!

582
00:54:49,344 --> 00:54:50,512
Drop the guns!

583
00:54:50,971 --> 00:54:51,888
I need him!

584
00:54:52,305 --> 00:54:54,557
He wants Blade alive! Go!

585
00:54:59,062 --> 00:55:00,480
You've been
listening in the whole time?

586
00:55:00,981 --> 00:55:01,940
Keeping
radio contact.

587
00:55:02,357 --> 00:55:05,235
Think I'd let him run loose
without a chaperon?

588
00:55:13,326 --> 00:55:15,787
Christ!
I'm too old for this.

589
00:55:16,288 --> 00:55:18,415
Somebody get me
a god-damn wheelchair.

590
00:55:26,881 --> 00:55:28,049
Whistler!

591
00:55:28,508 --> 00:55:30,135
He can take care
of himself.

592
00:55:30,593 --> 00:55:31,594
Jump!

593
00:55:52,615 --> 00:55:54,701
Aah!

594
00:56:07,505 --> 00:56:08,923
Aah!

595
00:56:31,488 --> 00:56:34,365
Aah!

596
00:56:40,747 --> 00:56:42,540
Aah!

597
00:56:52,592 --> 00:56:54,302
What are you
gonna do?

598
00:56:55,386 --> 00:56:56,805
Oh, my God.

599
00:57:11,402 --> 00:57:12,946
What's wrong?

600
00:57:15,406 --> 00:57:17,242
It's dislocated.

601
00:57:17,659 --> 00:57:18,952
Ah!

602
00:57:19,452 --> 00:57:20,912
Let me help you.

603
00:57:23,957 --> 00:57:25,542
Aah!

604
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:33,508
Letme give you--

605
00:57:33,925 --> 00:57:35,718
No! Getaway.

606
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:53,444
You're one of them,
aren'tyou?

607
00:57:56,364 --> 00:57:57,615
No.

608
00:57:58,116 --> 00:57:59,367
I'm something else.

609
00:58:07,292 --> 00:58:09,585
I found him
when he was 13.

610
00:58:10,086 --> 00:58:11,587
He'd been livin'
on the streets,

611
00:58:12,088 --> 00:58:13,631
feedin' off
the homeless.

612
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:16,551
His need for blood had
taken over at puberty.

613
00:58:17,010 --> 00:58:20,638
I took him
for a vampire at first.

614
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:22,473
Almost killed him, too.

615
00:58:22,890 --> 00:58:25,560
Then I realized
what he was.

616
00:58:25,977 --> 00:58:28,730
Blade's mother was
attacked by a vampire

617
00:58:29,147 --> 00:58:30,606
while she was pregnant.

618
00:58:31,024 --> 00:58:33,568
She died, but he Lived.

619
00:58:34,027 --> 00:58:34,777
Unfortunately,

620
00:58:35,194 --> 00:58:37,322
he'd undergone
certain genetic changes.

621
00:58:37,822 --> 00:58:41,284
He can with stand
garlic, sliver,

622
00:58:41,784 --> 00:58:42,910
even sunLight,

623
00:58:43,328 --> 00:58:44,954
and he's got
their strength.

624
00:58:46,039 --> 00:58:46,831
This time tomorrow,

625
00:58:47,248 --> 00:58:50,043
all those wounds of his
will be healed.

626
00:58:52,003 --> 00:58:54,088
He still ages
like a human, though.

627
00:58:54,505 --> 00:58:56,632
See, vampires
age slower than us.

628
00:58:57,133 --> 00:59:00,261
Unfortunately...

629
00:59:00,678 --> 00:59:02,597
he also inherited
their thirst.

630
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:06,768
I thought the serum was
supposed to suppress that.

631
00:59:07,268 --> 00:59:09,479
Time's runnin' out.

632
00:59:11,064 --> 00:59:13,941
His body's
startin' to rejectit.

633
00:59:14,442 --> 00:59:18,529
Sofar, all my efforts
tofind a cure havefalled.

634
00:59:23,117 --> 00:59:24,911
Why do you hunt them?

635
00:59:27,121 --> 00:59:29,207
I had a family once

636
00:59:29,707 --> 00:59:31,918
wife and two daughters.

637
00:59:34,337 --> 00:59:36,714
Then a drifter came
callin' one evenin',

638
00:59:37,173 --> 00:59:38,132
a vampire.

639
00:59:40,259 --> 00:59:41,677
He toyed with 'em first,

640
00:59:42,136 --> 00:59:44,514
tried to make me decide

641
00:59:45,014 --> 00:59:46,724
which order
they'd die in.

642
00:59:50,436 --> 00:59:53,397
We kill as many of 'em
as we can find,

643
00:59:53,898 --> 00:59:55,066
but it's gettin' worse.

644
00:59:55,483 --> 00:59:56,651
Because of Frost.

645
00:59:57,151 --> 00:59:57,735
There's somethin'
happenin'

646
00:59:58,236 --> 01:00:00,196
in the vampire ranks.

647
01:00:00,613 --> 01:00:01,614
It's somethin' big...

648
01:00:02,114 --> 01:00:03,491
and I'd stake my Llfe

649
01:00:03,908 --> 01:00:07,453
that son of a bitch
is at the centre of it.

650
01:00:11,249 --> 01:00:12,250
Blade.

651
01:00:30,101 --> 01:00:32,019
Whistler told me
what happened.

652
01:00:34,897 --> 01:00:38,442
He told me
what you are.

653
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:43,072
You don't know me.

654
01:00:43,489 --> 01:00:45,408
You don't know
anything about me.

655
01:00:48,744 --> 01:00:50,788
I'm not human.

656
01:00:53,541 --> 01:00:54,750
You Lookhuman
to me--

657
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:57,712
Humans don't
drink blood.

658
01:00:58,212 --> 01:01:00,339
That was
a longtime ago.

659
01:01:00,756 --> 01:01:03,676
Maybe you should
let that go.

660
01:01:06,637 --> 01:01:08,139
I have spent
my whole Llfe

661
01:01:08,598 --> 01:01:11,851
Looking for that thing
that killed my mother.

662
01:01:12,351 --> 01:01:14,312
It made me what I am.

663
01:01:17,148 --> 01:01:20,776
And every time I take
one of those monsters out,

664
01:01:21,193 --> 01:01:23,738
I geta Little piece
of that life back,

665
01:01:24,155 --> 01:01:27,617
so don't you tell me
about forgetting.

666
01:01:30,786 --> 01:01:32,705
...my fault he took us
by surprise!

667
01:01:33,164 --> 01:01:34,957
Two of them against your
entire security force?

668
01:01:35,374 --> 01:01:37,376
Don't put that shit on me, OK,
'cause you were there, too!

669
01:01:37,877 --> 01:01:39,211
I'm sure Deacon
will appreciate--

670
01:01:39,628 --> 01:01:41,005
...stabbed in the balls
for it, all right?!

671
01:01:41,422 --> 01:01:42,298
Aah! You Little skeez!

672
01:01:42,715 --> 01:01:44,050
Don't see the Lifestyle
really suits you.

673
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:46,302
I Should put this stump through
that shit-eating grin of yours.

674
01:01:46,719 --> 01:01:47,970
Face it, angel.
You were sloppy.

675
01:01:48,429 --> 01:01:50,264
You got
what you deserved.

676
01:01:53,309 --> 01:01:55,603
Deac, let me
take this guy out, man.

677
01:01:56,103 --> 01:01:57,480
Look. Look what
he fuckin' did!

678
01:01:57,897 --> 01:01:58,814
He took my hand again!

679
01:01:59,315 --> 01:02:01,108
Listen to me.
I want him alive.

680
01:02:01,567 --> 01:02:03,069
What the fuck
are you talk--

681
01:02:03,569 --> 01:02:04,695
you want him alive?

682
01:02:05,196 --> 01:02:07,281
We've been tryin' to kill
this motherfucker for years.

683
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:09,784
Are you out of
your fuckin' mind? Shh.

684
01:02:10,284 --> 01:02:13,871
Big guy, relax.

685
01:02:14,372 --> 01:02:15,623
Be patient.

686
01:02:17,208 --> 01:02:19,335
Now, we got a lot
to do here.

687
01:02:19,835 --> 01:02:20,795
I need you, man.

688
01:02:21,212 --> 01:02:22,546
Heh.

689
01:02:23,005 --> 01:02:24,006
Heh.

690
01:02:25,174 --> 01:02:25,800
I need you.

691
01:02:26,217 --> 01:02:27,218
Yeah.

692
01:03:10,678 --> 01:03:12,179
Aorning.

693
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:14,181
How youfeeLln'?

694
01:03:23,649 --> 01:03:24,650
Look at that.

695
01:03:28,863 --> 01:03:31,115
Whew. Gettin' a Little
toasty outhere, huh?

696
01:03:31,532 --> 01:03:32,157
Heh heh.

697
01:03:33,617 --> 01:03:34,785
When was the last time

698
01:03:35,244 --> 01:03:37,580
you stopped to appreciate
a good sunrise?

699
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:39,999
Oh, that's right.
You were born a vampire,

700
01:03:40,457 --> 01:03:42,543
so you never had
the pleasure, have you?

701
01:03:43,043 --> 01:03:43,586
That's OK.

702
01:03:44,086 --> 01:03:44,712
It's all right.

703
01:03:45,212 --> 01:03:46,338
Least we're here together.

704
01:03:46,755 --> 01:03:47,631
Share the moment,

705
01:03:48,132 --> 01:03:50,801
which means a Lot to me,
by the way, really.

706
01:03:51,302 --> 01:03:52,678
I mean that.

707
01:03:54,597 --> 01:03:57,099
'Cause actually, you know,
when you get to know me,

708
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,560
I'm a fairly
sentimental type of guy.

709
01:03:59,977 --> 01:04:01,729
Bit of an innocent,
you mightsay.

710
01:04:05,065 --> 01:04:07,651
Do what you want,
Frost.

711
01:04:08,068 --> 01:04:09,987
Doesn't make
any difference.

712
01:04:11,322 --> 01:04:14,283
You just don't
fuckin' get it.

713
01:04:15,618 --> 01:04:16,785
You're never
gonna be a pureblood.

714
01:04:17,202 --> 01:04:18,746
Hold him.

715
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:23,375
You will never rule us.

716
01:04:25,002 --> 01:04:26,920
Aah!

717
01:04:30,591 --> 01:04:31,759
Aah!

718
01:04:34,887 --> 01:04:35,638
Ow.

719
01:04:36,138 --> 01:04:37,723
Jesus Christ.

720
01:04:38,223 --> 01:04:39,016
Have a nice day.

721
01:04:39,475 --> 01:04:40,392
Sorry, you old dog.

722
01:04:40,809 --> 01:04:43,520
You just gota little
too long in the tooth.

723
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:46,899
What, man?
That was funny.

724
01:04:47,399 --> 01:04:48,609
''Long, tooth.''
Funny.

725
01:04:49,109 --> 01:04:51,445
Did I tell you
the one about...

726
01:04:53,781 --> 01:04:55,366
Aah!

727
01:05:21,183 --> 01:05:23,143
What have you done
with Dragonetti?

728
01:05:30,275 --> 01:05:32,486
Let's get down to business,
shall we?

729
01:05:32,986 --> 01:05:36,115
I need 12 volunteers.
Tkktkk.

730
01:05:42,121 --> 01:05:43,122
Whistler.

731
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:47,668
What is this?

732
01:05:49,461 --> 01:05:51,672
Smells like a vampire
wiped his ass with it.

733
01:05:52,089 --> 01:05:53,382
I took it
from the archives.

734
01:05:53,841 --> 01:05:54,842
It's written in blood.

735
01:05:55,342 --> 01:05:57,803
It's from
the Book of Erebus.

736
01:06:02,182 --> 01:06:04,643
I think it's what Frost
has been workin' on.

737
01:06:05,102 --> 01:06:06,895
It's somethin'
about the Blood God,

738
01:06:07,312 --> 01:06:08,689
the spirits of the 12.

739
01:06:09,148 --> 01:06:09,773
I--I don't know.

740
01:06:10,232 --> 01:06:11,483
I can't make out
the rest of it.

741
01:06:11,984 --> 01:06:13,152
Maybe this'll help.

742
01:06:14,278 --> 01:06:15,571
I'll figure out something.

743
01:06:17,281 --> 01:06:18,490
So what's all this?

744
01:06:18,991 --> 01:06:21,160
Took a trip to
the hospital last night,

745
01:06:21,577 --> 01:06:23,162
borrowed some equipment.

746
01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:26,248
For your
miracle cure?

747
01:06:28,167 --> 01:06:29,084
This is E.D.T.A.

748
01:06:29,543 --> 01:06:30,210
It's an anticoagulant.

749
01:06:30,627 --> 01:06:32,671
We use it
to treat blood cloths.

750
01:06:33,172 --> 01:06:36,133
Nowlook whathappens
when I introduce it

751
01:06:36,592 --> 01:06:38,969
onto a sample
of vampire blood.

752
01:06:40,220 --> 01:06:41,680
Take a stepback.

753
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:43,724
The reaction's
energetic.

754
01:06:53,191 --> 01:06:53,901
Some cure.

755
01:06:54,318 --> 01:06:56,820
I didn't say E.D.T.A.
was a cure.

756
01:06:57,279 --> 01:06:58,864
Butmaybe
you could use it

757
01:06:59,281 --> 01:07:01,408
to explode
some vampire heads.

758
01:07:03,952 --> 01:07:04,494
Wait a minute.

759
01:07:04,995 --> 01:07:06,747
I need a sample
of your blood.

760
01:07:07,205 --> 01:07:07,956
Later.

761
01:07:08,373 --> 01:07:10,208
Gotta go downtown.

762
01:07:10,667 --> 01:07:11,460
Need some serum.

763
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:12,878
Serum can wait.

764
01:07:13,337 --> 01:07:14,880
This is important.

765
01:07:36,985 --> 01:07:38,403
Is he sick?

766
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:39,821
Cancer.

767
01:07:42,074 --> 01:07:44,785
You have a lot of love
for him, don'tyou?

768
01:07:45,285 --> 01:07:47,204
We have
a good arrangement.

769
01:07:47,704 --> 01:07:50,207
He makes the weapons.
I use 'em.

770
01:07:54,252 --> 01:07:56,088
You know,
my mother used to say,

771
01:07:56,546 --> 01:07:58,799
''A cold heart
is a dead heart.''

772
01:08:16,858 --> 01:08:18,360
You don't look so good.

773
01:08:19,444 --> 01:08:20,779
I'm justa little tired.

774
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:22,447
You know we've been...

775
01:08:22,864 --> 01:08:24,241
workin' all night.

776
01:08:26,827 --> 01:08:29,329
I guess we didn't
catch it in time.

777
01:08:30,914 --> 01:08:31,998
You got another day,

778
01:08:32,499 --> 01:08:34,251
two at the most.

779
01:08:39,089 --> 01:08:40,966
For what it's worth,
I'm sorry.

780
01:08:41,466 --> 01:08:44,594
You make itsound
like I'm already dead.

781
01:09:02,696 --> 01:09:03,697
Blade.

782
01:09:29,139 --> 01:09:30,765
How you doin', chief?

783
01:09:32,225 --> 01:09:32,809
Easy.

784
01:09:34,853 --> 01:09:36,438
Wouldn't want
our little friend here

785
01:09:36,897 --> 01:09:39,816
to wind upon the back of
a mllk carton, now would we?

786
01:09:41,234 --> 01:09:44,279
Ah, it's nice
to finally meet you, man.

787
01:09:44,779 --> 01:09:46,740
Had my eye on you
for years.

788
01:09:47,157 --> 01:09:48,283
I know all about you--

789
01:09:48,783 --> 01:09:51,286
your serum, Whistler--
everything.

790
01:09:51,786 --> 01:09:53,496
Sunblock.

791
01:09:53,997 --> 01:09:55,665
Hey, it's a start, right?

792
01:09:56,124 --> 01:09:58,668
The goal, of course,
is to be like you,

793
01:09:59,127 --> 01:10:00,795
the daywalker.

794
01:10:01,254 --> 01:10:03,340
You got the best
of both worlds, don'tyou?

795
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,092
All our strengths...

796
01:10:06,509 --> 01:10:07,427
none of our weaknesses.

797
01:10:07,928 --> 01:10:10,555
Well, maybe I don't
see it that way.

798
01:10:11,056 --> 01:10:13,600
Oh, so it's back
to pretending we're human again?

799
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:17,437
Come on. Spare me
the Uncle Tom routine, OK?

800
01:10:17,854 --> 01:10:20,649
You can't keep denying
what you are, man.

801
01:10:21,107 --> 01:10:22,233
Heh.You think the humans

802
01:10:22,692 --> 01:10:24,569
will ever accept
a half-breed like you?

803
01:10:24,986 --> 01:10:26,821
They can't.
They're afraid of you.

804
01:10:28,448 --> 01:10:29,699
And they Should be.

805
01:10:30,116 --> 01:10:30,742
You're an animal.

806
01:10:31,159 --> 01:10:33,203
You're a fuckin'
maniac.

807
01:10:36,122 --> 01:10:37,290
Look at'em.

808
01:10:37,791 --> 01:10:39,668
They're cattle,

809
01:10:40,085 --> 01:10:41,670
pieces of meat.

810
01:10:42,128 --> 01:10:44,714
What difference does it make
how their world ends?

811
01:10:45,173 --> 01:10:45,757
Plague...

812
01:10:46,174 --> 01:10:47,217
war...

813
01:10:47,717 --> 01:10:48,885
famine.

814
01:10:49,302 --> 01:10:51,262
Morality doesn't even
enter into it.

815
01:10:51,763 --> 01:10:54,349
We're just a function
of natural selection, man,

816
01:10:54,849 --> 01:10:56,851
the new race.

817
01:10:58,395 --> 01:11:01,022
Looks like
your mascara's running.

818
01:11:08,196 --> 01:11:10,073
I'm offering you a truce.

819
01:11:10,532 --> 01:11:11,700
I want you with us.

820
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:14,160
What do you think,
I'm stupid?

821
01:11:22,794 --> 01:11:24,379
You're famlliar
with the Blood God.

822
01:11:24,838 --> 01:11:27,090
Frost...

823
01:11:27,590 --> 01:11:29,801
you're nothing
to me...

824
01:11:30,218 --> 01:11:32,804
but another
dead vampire.

825
01:11:33,221 --> 01:11:34,806
You're an idlot.
You know that?

826
01:11:35,223 --> 01:11:37,976
I came down here
offering you an easy way out,

827
01:11:38,393 --> 01:11:41,312
and you spit it right back
in my fuckin' face.

828
01:11:41,813 --> 01:11:43,064
Careful.

829
01:11:47,444 --> 01:11:49,904
What do I care?

830
01:11:50,363 --> 01:11:52,240
They're nothing
but cattle...

831
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:54,159
just like you said.

832
01:11:54,576 --> 01:11:57,162
If you wanna take
the hard road, be my guest, pal,

833
01:11:57,620 --> 01:12:00,165
but I promise you
by the time this is over,

834
01:12:00,582 --> 01:12:03,585
you're gonna wish they never
cut you from your mother's--

835
01:12:13,094 --> 01:12:14,429
aah!

836
01:12:38,453 --> 01:12:39,704
Go home.

837
01:12:43,124 --> 01:12:43,833
It was simple.

838
01:12:44,292 --> 01:12:46,252
Why do vampires
need to drinkblood?

839
01:12:46,711 --> 01:12:48,588
'Cause their own blood
can't sustain haemoglobin.

840
01:12:49,088 --> 01:12:50,423
Right. So it's
a genetic defect,

841
01:12:50,924 --> 01:12:51,633
just like
haemolytic anaemia.

842
01:12:52,133 --> 01:12:54,260
That means that
we have to treatit

843
01:12:54,677 --> 01:12:55,511
with gene therapy,

844
01:12:56,012 --> 01:12:57,972
rewrite the victim's DNA
with a retrovirus.

845
01:12:58,431 --> 01:13:00,683
They've been using it
on sickle cell anaemia.

846
01:13:01,184 --> 01:13:02,310
Are you sure
that's safe?

847
01:13:02,727 --> 01:13:03,728
I have no idea,

848
01:13:04,229 --> 01:13:06,648
but I don't have
a choice, do I?

849
01:13:08,316 --> 01:13:10,193
You actually think
this could work?

850
01:13:10,652 --> 01:13:12,070
On me...

851
01:13:12,570 --> 01:13:13,821
yes.

852
01:13:14,322 --> 01:13:16,491
On Blade,
I'm not so sure.

853
01:13:16,908 --> 01:13:18,117
See, he didn't
contract vampirism

854
01:13:18,618 --> 01:13:20,036
from a bite
like I did.

855
01:13:20,536 --> 01:13:21,704
He was born with it.

856
01:13:22,121 --> 01:13:23,831
It's--it's part
of his DNA.

857
01:13:24,248 --> 01:13:26,793
I'm sure I can cure
his thirst,

858
01:13:27,210 --> 01:13:28,461
but it's gonna
take time.

859
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:30,880
Ah, we're out of time.

860
01:13:31,297 --> 01:13:33,675
You saw what was
on that disc.

861
01:13:38,346 --> 01:13:39,847
Damn.

862
01:13:41,891 --> 01:13:43,059
Get out of here.

863
01:14:07,834 --> 01:14:10,044
I said get out of here!

864
01:14:15,758 --> 01:14:16,843
Nice place.

865
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:19,512
Took us a while
to find it!

866
01:14:26,769 --> 01:14:28,271
Bite me
and ge tit over with.

867
01:14:28,771 --> 01:14:30,606
I ain't gonna bite you.

868
01:14:44,078 --> 01:14:45,079
Do your thing.

869
01:14:57,508 --> 01:14:58,634
Whistler.

870
01:15:59,153 --> 01:16:00,112
Ohh.

871
01:16:06,327 --> 01:16:08,746
Frost tookher.

872
01:16:16,462 --> 01:16:17,922
Listen to me.

873
01:16:20,967 --> 01:16:22,093
The disc.

874
01:16:23,427 --> 01:16:24,679
He decoded it.

875
01:16:25,137 --> 01:16:27,932
Frost is trying to...

876
01:16:28,349 --> 01:16:31,852
trigger a fuckin'
vampire apocalypse.

877
01:16:33,980 --> 01:16:35,982
There's some kind of...

878
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:39,527
Vampire God he's trying
to resurrect.

879
01:16:41,195 --> 01:16:42,697
La Aagra.

880
01:16:46,117 --> 01:16:47,827
You're the key.

881
01:16:49,370 --> 01:16:51,080
He needs
your blood.

882
01:16:54,834 --> 01:16:56,961
The blood
of the daywalker.

883
01:16:59,630 --> 01:17:02,258
You're the chosen one.

884
01:17:05,845 --> 01:17:07,054
Listen to me, Blade.

885
01:17:08,639 --> 01:17:10,141
You can't
go after him.

886
01:17:10,641 --> 01:17:11,892
Bullshit.

887
01:17:12,351 --> 01:17:14,186
If Frost gets
his hands on you,

888
01:17:14,687 --> 01:17:17,064
it's all over.

889
01:17:20,067 --> 01:17:22,737
There'll be armies
of the motherfuckers.

890
01:17:25,448 --> 01:17:26,449
Shit.

891
01:17:30,828 --> 01:17:32,830
You're gonna have
to finish me off.

892
01:17:33,289 --> 01:17:36,542
Don't want me
coming back.

893
01:17:38,544 --> 01:17:40,421
We can treat
the wounds.

894
01:17:42,131 --> 01:17:43,507
It's too far gone.

895
01:17:43,924 --> 01:17:46,093
You know that.

896
01:17:49,430 --> 01:17:52,057
Give me your gun.

897
01:17:53,517 --> 01:17:55,060
No.

898
01:17:56,270 --> 01:17:58,939
Give me
the god-damn gun.

899
01:18:24,048 --> 01:18:25,007
Now walk away,

900
01:18:25,466 --> 01:18:27,718
you stupid
son of a bitch.

901
01:18:32,556 --> 01:18:34,850
Walk the fuck away.

902
01:18:55,913 --> 01:18:56,830
By the time you watch this,

903
01:18:57,248 --> 01:18:58,541
your friend Whistler
Should be dead.

904
01:18:58,999 --> 01:19:00,459
If it makes any
difference to you,

905
01:19:00,918 --> 01:19:02,127
he put up
quite a fight.

906
01:19:02,628 --> 01:19:05,256
You can find us
at the Edgewood Towers.

907
01:20:43,604 --> 01:20:44,563
You seem a bit...

908
01:20:44,980 --> 01:20:45,689
tense.

909
01:20:46,106 --> 01:20:47,733
A bitpent-up maybe,

910
01:20:48,150 --> 01:20:49,693
like you need to
release something.

911
01:20:50,778 --> 01:20:51,445
You know?

912
01:20:51,904 --> 01:20:52,988
Blade not...

913
01:20:54,239 --> 01:20:56,533
givin' it to you
maybe.

914
01:20:57,618 --> 01:20:58,660
I don't know.
I just...

915
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:02,080
I see such
a beautiful woman.

916
01:21:03,832 --> 01:21:05,083
Greatskin.

917
01:21:07,878 --> 01:21:09,546
I'd like to see you
happy, that's all.

918
01:21:10,047 --> 01:21:13,217
Is this the part where
you offer to turn me?

919
01:21:14,718 --> 01:21:16,887
Well, it's either that
or a body bag.

920
01:21:17,346 --> 01:21:18,514
Go ahead.

921
01:21:19,014 --> 01:21:20,182
Bite me.

922
01:21:20,599 --> 01:21:23,227
I'll just cure myself.

923
01:21:23,644 --> 01:21:24,603
I did it before,

924
01:21:25,103 --> 01:21:26,396
and I can do it again.

925
01:21:26,814 --> 01:21:28,232
There is no cure,
baby.

926
01:21:28,690 --> 01:21:29,775
There is if you've
been bit,

927
01:21:30,275 --> 01:21:33,570
if you were once human.

928
01:21:38,951 --> 01:21:39,952
How'dyou get
that scar, Deacon?

929
01:21:40,452 --> 01:21:41,578
A born vampire

930
01:21:41,995 --> 01:21:44,373
would have the power
to regenerate from birth.

931
01:21:44,832 --> 01:21:47,626
You must've gotten scarred
before you were turned.

932
01:21:48,085 --> 01:21:49,002
Isn't that right?

933
01:21:49,503 --> 01:21:52,506
Vampires like you
aren't a species.

934
01:21:52,965 --> 01:21:55,676
You're just...infected,
a virus...

935
01:21:56,134 --> 01:21:57,761
a sexually transmitted
disease.

936
01:21:58,220 --> 01:21:59,221
I'll tell you
what we are, sister.

937
01:21:59,721 --> 01:22:01,890
We're the top of
the fuckin' food chain.

938
01:22:02,349 --> 01:22:04,017
The Blood God's coming.
And after tonight,

939
01:22:04,434 --> 01:22:06,019
you people
are fuckin' history.

940
01:22:07,563 --> 01:22:08,689
He's a hurricane,

941
01:22:09,189 --> 01:22:10,816
an act of God.

942
01:22:11,275 --> 01:22:12,568
Anyone caught
in his path

943
01:22:13,068 --> 01:22:14,236
will instantly
be turned.

944
01:22:16,154 --> 01:22:17,406
Everyone you've
ever known,

945
01:22:17,864 --> 01:22:20,659
everyone you've ever
fucking loved.

946
01:22:21,118 --> 01:22:22,661
It won't matter
who's pureblood

947
01:22:23,161 --> 01:22:24,371
and who's not.

948
01:22:24,788 --> 01:22:27,457
How are you gonna cure
the whole fuckin' world?

949
01:22:29,209 --> 01:22:30,752
Hmm?

950
01:22:34,172 --> 01:22:36,133
And Blade's blood
is the key.

951
01:22:36,717 --> 01:22:38,385
We gotan intruder.

952
01:23:07,456 --> 01:23:08,290
Deac, I don't think
you understand.

953
01:23:08,749 --> 01:23:09,624
I mean, this dude
is fuckin' bad. What?

954
01:23:10,125 --> 01:23:11,752
He's, like, he had
20 guys around him--

955
01:23:12,252 --> 01:23:13,628
and he's got shit
he throws at you--

956
01:23:14,129 --> 01:23:15,297
Yeah, the swords.

957
01:23:15,714 --> 01:23:16,631
Throw it in the air,
catch it underneath.

958
01:23:17,132 --> 01:23:18,383
Yeah. Shut thefuck up!

959
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:19,760
There's no
intruder where we are.

960
01:23:20,260 --> 01:23:21,636
Look, make it happen,
all right?

961
01:23:22,137 --> 01:23:23,347
It's one guy on foot.

962
01:23:28,060 --> 01:23:29,728
That's him!
Gethim!

963
01:23:49,206 --> 01:23:50,749
Why am I hearing
gunfire? Huh?

964
01:23:51,208 --> 01:23:53,502
Did I tell anybody
to startshooting?

965
01:23:54,002 --> 01:23:55,003
I need him alive.

966
01:23:55,420 --> 01:23:56,505
No!

967
01:23:59,174 --> 01:24:01,134
Please!

968
01:24:01,551 --> 01:24:02,761
I just workfor them!

969
01:24:05,138 --> 01:24:06,556
Jesus Christ.
Lock this place down.

970
01:24:07,057 --> 01:24:08,058
Yes, sir!

971
01:24:44,803 --> 01:24:46,972
Aah!

972
01:24:47,389 --> 01:24:49,558
Aieee!
Aah!

973
01:25:55,415 --> 01:25:57,083
Eric?

974
01:26:08,136 --> 01:26:09,763
But you died.

975
01:26:11,139 --> 01:26:13,183
I came back, Eric.

976
01:26:13,641 --> 01:26:14,893
That very same night...

977
01:26:16,728 --> 01:26:19,314
when Deacon welcomed me
into his arms.

978
01:26:27,197 --> 01:26:29,115
Uhh!

979
01:26:36,289 --> 01:26:38,792
Jesus Christ. I thought
you'd be happy.

980
01:26:39,250 --> 01:26:40,210
You're finally being
reunited with your mother,

981
01:26:40,710 --> 01:26:42,045
and you act like this?

982
01:26:43,755 --> 01:26:45,632
Blade, give itup.
It's over.

983
01:26:46,132 --> 01:26:47,842
She belongs to me,
buddy.

984
01:26:48,301 --> 01:26:49,302
Uh! Uhh!

985
01:26:51,262 --> 01:26:52,347
Don't look so surprised.

986
01:26:52,806 --> 01:26:54,307
You spent your whole Life

987
01:26:54,724 --> 01:26:57,143
Looking for the vampire
who bit your mother.

988
01:26:57,602 --> 01:26:59,479
Well, here I am.

989
01:27:01,773 --> 01:27:02,690
Who would ever guess

990
01:27:03,191 --> 01:27:05,276
you'd survive
your mother's death?

991
01:27:05,735 --> 01:27:06,653
But you did.

992
01:27:07,112 --> 01:27:08,321
And here we are--

993
01:27:08,780 --> 01:27:11,074
one big happy
fuckin' famlly.

994
01:27:22,502 --> 01:27:24,212
I need my serum.

995
01:27:26,965 --> 01:27:27,924
Maybe when we
get outta this,

996
01:27:28,341 --> 01:27:30,176
I'll take that
miracle cure of yours.

997
01:27:30,635 --> 01:27:32,178
There's one catch.

998
01:27:36,141 --> 01:27:37,725
If it works,

999
01:27:38,184 --> 01:27:39,102
you'll lose
your strength

1000
01:27:39,519 --> 01:27:43,481
and your abllity
to regenerate.

1001
01:27:43,982 --> 01:27:45,984
You'll be
completely human.

1002
01:28:07,130 --> 01:28:08,172
Uhh!

1003
01:28:47,837 --> 01:28:50,256
Blade, Karen,

1004
01:28:50,715 --> 01:28:52,216
glad you could make it.

1005
01:28:52,675 --> 01:28:54,927
Hey, man.Thanks
for the shades.

1006
01:28:56,346 --> 01:28:58,389
Our ancestors
called this place

1007
01:28:58,848 --> 01:29:01,017
the Temple
of Eternal Night.

1008
01:29:04,145 --> 01:29:05,688
Nice, isn't it?

1009
01:29:06,105 --> 01:29:08,650
Apparently, these geniuses
forgot it ever existed.

1010
01:29:09,067 --> 01:29:11,444
Fortunately for us...

1011
01:29:11,903 --> 01:29:12,904
I'm what you
might call a...

1012
01:29:13,321 --> 01:29:15,907
student of history.

1013
01:29:29,253 --> 01:29:31,297
Why are we here?

1014
01:29:32,799 --> 01:29:36,969
This temple was bullt
for one glorious moment--

1015
01:29:37,428 --> 01:29:40,681
this night,
for the Blood God.

1016
01:29:49,065 --> 01:29:50,274
Thanks.

1017
01:29:55,530 --> 01:29:57,031
Let's see
this sword of yours.

1018
01:30:00,618 --> 01:30:01,702
Well.

1019
01:30:02,161 --> 01:30:02,870
Titanium, right?

1020
01:30:03,371 --> 01:30:05,373
Acid-etched?

1021
01:30:07,125 --> 01:30:09,919
I'll get used
to a weapon like this.

1022
01:30:15,508 --> 01:30:16,175
What?

1023
01:30:16,676 --> 01:30:19,137
You Look surprised.

1024
01:30:19,595 --> 01:30:20,805
I told you, Blade,

1025
01:30:21,264 --> 01:30:23,349
I know everything
aboutyou.

1026
01:30:24,433 --> 01:30:25,476
Hold out your arm,
Quinn.

1027
01:30:25,977 --> 01:30:26,727
Why, man?

1028
01:30:27,186 --> 01:30:27,854
These are--they're,
like, all better.

1029
01:30:28,312 --> 01:30:29,230
Hold out your arm.

1030
01:30:29,647 --> 01:30:30,648
Now.

1031
01:30:34,610 --> 01:30:35,653
Deac, I--

1032
01:30:40,867 --> 01:30:41,868
Just kidding.

1033
01:30:44,203 --> 01:30:45,788
Ha ha ha ha!
He wasfuckin'
with me.

1034
01:30:46,289 --> 01:30:47,540
He was, like,
fuckin'...

1035
01:30:47,999 --> 01:30:48,624
Blade.

1036
01:30:49,041 --> 01:30:51,002
Blade.

1037
01:30:51,502 --> 01:30:52,170
He can't hear you,
honey.

1038
01:30:52,628 --> 01:30:54,130
The thirst has
got him now.

1039
01:31:00,970 --> 01:31:01,762
What do we have here?

1040
01:31:02,180 --> 01:31:04,599
The precious serum.

1041
01:31:05,057 --> 01:31:08,436
Am. How long's it been
since you shot up?

1042
01:31:08,895 --> 01:31:11,230
12, 13 hours maybe?

1043
01:31:11,731 --> 01:31:13,649
I bet you're just
dying for a drink,

1044
01:31:14,108 --> 01:31:15,192
aren't you?

1045
01:31:17,737 --> 01:31:18,946
What's it feel like?

1046
01:31:20,907 --> 01:31:22,408
Is your blood on fire?

1047
01:31:22,909 --> 01:31:24,952
Try some.

1048
01:31:25,411 --> 01:31:27,622
You might like it.

1049
01:31:28,122 --> 01:31:30,166
Thanks, but I prefer
the real thing.

1050
01:31:30,583 --> 01:31:32,501
In any event,

1051
01:31:33,002 --> 01:31:35,087
I don't think you'll be
needing these any more.

1052
01:31:42,470 --> 01:31:43,804
It's a shame, you know?

1053
01:31:45,139 --> 01:31:46,474
When I think of what
you've become,

1054
01:31:46,891 --> 01:31:49,143
what you should
have become.

1055
01:31:49,644 --> 01:31:51,228
I guess
I don't blame you.

1056
01:31:51,687 --> 01:31:52,980
I mean, with everything
that's happened,

1057
01:31:53,481 --> 01:31:54,523
it's the human
side of you

1058
01:31:54,982 --> 01:31:56,233
that's made you weak.

1059
01:31:56,734 --> 01:31:57,902
You should've listened
to your blood.

1060
01:31:58,361 --> 01:32:00,237
Say what you want,

1061
01:32:00,738 --> 01:32:03,532
but I promise you,
you'll be dead by dawn.

1062
01:32:03,991 --> 01:32:05,117
Ooh.

1063
01:32:07,828 --> 01:32:09,789
Get him outta here.

1064
01:32:14,168 --> 01:32:16,170
Get these fucks
downstairs. Now.

1065
01:32:16,587 --> 01:32:18,047
Come on. Let's go.

1066
01:32:18,464 --> 01:32:20,257
Let's go.

1067
01:32:24,220 --> 01:32:25,137
Don't worry,
sweetheart.

1068
01:32:25,554 --> 01:32:26,347
We haven't
forgotten about you.

1069
01:32:26,764 --> 01:32:27,682
Oh, no, baby.

1070
01:32:28,182 --> 01:32:31,143
We got something real
special planned for you.

1071
01:32:32,395 --> 01:32:33,646
That surfer boy
had a nice ass.

1072
01:32:34,146 --> 01:32:35,064
I sucked him dry.

1073
01:32:35,523 --> 01:32:36,857
And you'd figure
he'd turn, man.

1074
01:32:37,358 --> 01:32:38,275
Yeah, but he didn't
turn, did he?

1075
01:32:38,734 --> 01:32:39,652
No. He turned into
some kinda zombie.

1076
01:32:40,152 --> 01:32:41,654
It happens
sometimes, cutie.

1077
01:32:43,572 --> 01:32:44,240
He was fuckin'
tripped out.

1078
01:32:44,699 --> 01:32:45,658
Pathetic.

1079
01:32:46,075 --> 01:32:47,785
Yeah.These guys
are complete scum, man.

1080
01:32:48,202 --> 01:32:49,120
They'll eat anything--

1081
01:32:49,620 --> 01:32:53,249
animals, rodents, corpses,
and sometimes...

1082
01:32:54,708 --> 01:32:55,668
They'll even
eat vampires.

1083
01:32:56,127 --> 01:32:57,253
That's a plus.

1084
01:32:57,753 --> 01:32:58,796
And bearing that
all in mind,

1085
01:32:59,213 --> 01:33:01,048
I'd like you to meet
an old friend of yours.

1086
01:33:02,883 --> 01:33:04,051
Uh!

1087
01:33:05,761 --> 01:33:06,762
Uh!

1088
01:33:07,221 --> 01:33:07,888
It's too bad.

1089
01:33:08,347 --> 01:33:10,724
I kinda liked her.

1090
01:33:11,183 --> 01:33:12,309
What a waste.

1091
01:33:34,081 --> 01:33:35,875
I don't know what's
happening to me.

1092
01:33:37,209 --> 01:33:38,669
No pulse.

1093
01:33:39,086 --> 01:33:39,920
And, of course,

1094
01:33:40,421 --> 01:33:42,173
there's the question
of Lividity.

1095
01:33:43,966 --> 01:33:45,176
Curtis?

1096
01:33:47,261 --> 01:33:48,637
Ahh.

1097
01:33:49,054 --> 01:33:51,056
Karen?

1098
01:33:52,224 --> 01:33:53,267
Karen.

1099
01:33:54,602 --> 01:33:56,770
I never thought
I would see you again.

1100
01:33:57,188 --> 01:33:58,731
Tell me, Karen,

1101
01:33:59,190 --> 01:34:01,192
do you ever have
second thoughts about us?

1102
01:34:19,460 --> 01:34:20,753
Karen!

1103
01:34:21,253 --> 01:34:23,214
Karen!

1104
01:34:23,672 --> 01:34:24,882
Karen!

1105
01:34:26,258 --> 01:34:28,260
Karen!

1106
01:34:28,719 --> 01:34:29,929
Karen.

1107
01:34:30,429 --> 01:34:32,514
Karen!

1108
01:35:37,413 --> 01:35:38,956
Poor chlld.

1109
01:35:40,791 --> 01:35:42,292
You're so sick.

1110
01:35:43,752 --> 01:35:45,504
So thirsty.

1111
01:35:45,963 --> 01:35:48,090
Don't touch me.

1112
01:35:50,718 --> 01:35:53,178
Eric, Look at me.

1113
01:35:53,679 --> 01:35:56,014
Vampires are
my people now.

1114
01:35:56,432 --> 01:35:58,767
I'm one of them.

1115
01:35:59,226 --> 01:36:00,519
Can't be.

1116
01:36:02,104 --> 01:36:03,814
Yes, it can.

1117
01:36:06,233 --> 01:36:08,652
Try to understand,
Eric.

1118
01:36:09,820 --> 01:36:13,073
Your mother died
a long time ago.

1119
01:36:15,492 --> 01:36:16,869
I've hunted...

1120
01:36:18,579 --> 01:36:19,997
I've killed...

1121
01:36:22,416 --> 01:36:24,209
and I've enjoyed it.

1122
01:36:25,878 --> 01:36:27,045
Haven't you?

1123
01:36:28,839 --> 01:36:30,257
I know you have.

1124
01:36:32,551 --> 01:36:33,719
Sooner or later,

1125
01:36:34,136 --> 01:36:36,180
the thirst
always wins.

1126
01:37:20,766 --> 01:37:21,892
Come on.

1127
01:37:28,732 --> 01:37:29,900
Spread them out.

1128
01:37:31,068 --> 01:37:33,612
One on each glyph,
under the towers.

1129
01:37:34,071 --> 01:37:35,822
Make it perfect.

1130
01:38:13,860 --> 01:38:15,195
Yeah.

1131
01:38:16,405 --> 01:38:18,031
Bring the elevator up.

1132
01:38:57,529 --> 01:38:59,489
You stupid girl.

1133
01:38:59,990 --> 01:39:00,657
What do you think
is going to happen?

1134
01:39:01,158 --> 01:39:01,700
La Aagra?

1135
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:03,243
The Blood God?

1136
01:39:03,702 --> 01:39:04,870
That's nothing more
than a fairy tale

1137
01:39:05,370 --> 01:39:06,997
for pretty
little vampires.

1138
01:39:07,497 --> 01:39:08,331
Then why are you
sweating, pureblood?

1139
01:39:08,790 --> 01:39:12,210
You're a fraid we're
gonna steal your soul,

1140
01:39:12,669 --> 01:39:14,796
your pureblood spirit.

1141
01:39:15,255 --> 01:39:16,798
You should be.

1142
01:39:17,299 --> 01:39:18,550
Read the prophecy.

1143
01:39:19,009 --> 01:39:19,926
It's time you fucks

1144
01:39:20,427 --> 01:39:22,095
contributed something
to the cause.

1145
01:39:26,141 --> 01:39:27,309
Even if Frost is right,

1146
01:39:27,809 --> 01:39:30,479
you really think
he cares about you?

1147
01:39:30,937 --> 01:39:31,730
You're gonna die,

1148
01:39:32,189 --> 01:39:33,398
just like
the rest of us.

1149
01:39:33,899 --> 01:39:34,900
Waah!

1150
01:39:58,965 --> 01:40:00,091
Blade.

1151
01:40:09,351 --> 01:40:12,687
Tonight, the age of man
comes to an end.

1152
01:40:13,104 --> 01:40:14,356
No more compromises.

1153
01:40:14,814 --> 01:40:17,025
We're gonna be gods.

1154
01:40:18,735 --> 01:40:19,528
Of course we are.

1155
01:40:19,986 --> 01:40:22,822
Yeah!

1156
01:40:23,240 --> 01:40:24,241
I'm gonna be naughty.

1157
01:40:24,741 --> 01:40:26,618
I'm gonna be a naughty
Vampire God.

1158
01:40:27,077 --> 01:40:28,078
Ha ha ha!

1159
01:40:35,210 --> 01:40:36,670
Gotta stop...

1160
01:40:38,296 --> 01:40:39,297
stop...

1161
01:40:39,798 --> 01:40:41,466
Save your strength.

1162
01:40:41,967 --> 01:40:42,968
Blue.

1163
01:40:44,302 --> 01:40:45,679
You're hypovolemic.

1164
01:40:46,179 --> 01:40:47,430
You're bleeding
to death.

1165
01:40:47,931 --> 01:40:49,474
Need...

1166
01:40:49,975 --> 01:40:50,767
serum.

1167
01:41:09,035 --> 01:41:10,036
Blade.

1168
01:41:11,913 --> 01:41:13,873
Blade.

1169
01:41:16,084 --> 01:41:17,168
Listen to me.

1170
01:41:18,878 --> 01:41:21,172
I want you to take
some of my blood.

1171
01:41:23,091 --> 01:41:24,426
No.

1172
01:41:26,803 --> 01:41:27,971
No.

1173
01:41:29,139 --> 01:41:31,433
Look, just do it.

1174
01:41:57,167 --> 01:41:58,251
Is everybody thirsty?

1175
01:41:58,710 --> 01:42:02,172
I hope you're all
very fucking thirsty.

1176
01:42:20,732 --> 01:42:22,859
Ohh...

1177
01:42:23,318 --> 01:42:24,360
don't stop.

1178
01:42:27,530 --> 01:42:28,615
Don't stop.

1179
01:42:34,204 --> 01:42:35,205
Don't stop.

1180
01:42:49,803 --> 01:42:51,221
Don't stop.

1181
01:43:04,067 --> 01:43:06,110
Aah!

1182
01:43:43,356 --> 01:43:44,941
How was it?

1183
01:44:56,012 --> 01:44:57,388
Eric...

1184
01:44:58,473 --> 01:45:00,016
I'm your mother.

1185
01:45:02,268 --> 01:45:04,729
Youwouldn'thurt
your mother...

1186
01:45:05,188 --> 01:45:06,147
wouldyou?

1187
01:45:08,983 --> 01:45:09,984
Come here.

1188
01:45:14,405 --> 01:45:16,574
I mustrelease you.

1189
01:45:27,627 --> 01:45:28,586
Fuck!

1190
01:46:33,651 --> 01:46:34,569
Deacon?

1191
01:46:35,027 --> 01:46:36,237
Not anymore.

1192
01:46:52,128 --> 01:46:53,838
Frost!

1193
01:46:54,255 --> 01:46:54,964
Kill him.

1194
01:46:55,381 --> 01:46:57,049
Wait! I owe you, man.

1195
01:46:57,508 --> 01:46:58,968
I got two new hands, Blade.

1196
01:46:59,385 --> 01:47:01,762
I don't know which one
to use to killyouwith!

1197
01:47:22,199 --> 01:47:24,035
Frost.

1198
01:47:41,010 --> 01:47:42,970
I got struck
by Lightning

1199
01:48:45,866 --> 01:48:48,077
I'm really Going to
enjoy this now. Haah!

1200
01:49:36,625 --> 01:49:38,168
Hey, Blade.

1201
01:49:40,170 --> 01:49:42,131
Let's do this.

1202
01:50:35,768 --> 01:50:37,519
You're too late, Blade.

1203
01:50:57,081 --> 01:50:58,207
My turn.

1204
01:51:24,817 --> 01:51:25,609
Look at you.

1205
01:51:26,068 --> 01:51:27,319
You're a Little bitch.

1206
01:51:29,154 --> 01:51:30,697
What, your serum?

1207
01:51:31,156 --> 01:51:32,658
It can't help you
now, stud.

1208
01:51:40,082 --> 01:51:41,083
Nice shot.

1209
01:52:13,365 --> 01:52:14,074
Some motherfuckers

1210
01:52:14,575 --> 01:52:17,494
are always trying
to ice-skate uphill.

1211
01:52:49,443 --> 01:52:50,986
Blade!

1212
01:52:59,161 --> 01:53:01,079
Let's get out of here.

1213
01:53:37,115 --> 01:53:38,617
I need to get back
to the lab

1214
01:53:39,117 --> 01:53:41,662
if I'm going to cure you.

1215
01:53:42,162 --> 01:53:43,664
It's not over.

1216
01:53:44,164 --> 01:53:45,582
You keep your cure.

1217
01:53:46,708 --> 01:53:48,210
There's still
a war going on,

1218
01:53:48,627 --> 01:53:50,629
and I have a job to do.

1219
01:53:51,129 --> 01:53:52,839
You want to help,

1220
01:53:53,340 --> 01:53:55,634
make me a better serum.
