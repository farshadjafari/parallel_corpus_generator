1
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,688
Miss G, I wanted to thank you
for lending me the book.

2
00:01:17,364 --> 00:01:19,236
Did you read it?

3
00:01:19,781 --> 00:01:20,921
Yes.

4
00:01:21,052 --> 00:01:23,212
- Did you get caught?
- No.

5
00:01:23,344 --> 00:01:26,027
And anyway, I'm not sure
what all the fuss is about.

6
00:01:26,156 --> 00:01:27,899
I wasn't corrupted.

7
00:01:28,656 --> 00:01:31,903
Good for you.
Let them put that in their pipes.

8
00:01:45,283 --> 00:01:48,483
<i>* All things bright and beautiful</i>

9
00:01:48,616 --> 00:01:52,444
<i>* All creatures great and small</i>

10
00:01:52,575 --> 00:01:55,822
<i>* All things wise and wonderful</i>

11
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,322
<i>* The Lord God made them all</i>

12
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,364
<i>* All things bright and beautiful</i>

13
00:02:03,492 --> 00:02:07,533
<i>* All creatures great and small</i>

14
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:11,237
<i>* All things wise and wonderful</i>

15
00:02:11,367 --> 00:02:14,981
<i>* The Lord God made them all</i>

16
00:02:15,117 --> 00:02:18,566
<i>* Each little flower that opens</i>

17
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,818
<i>* Each little bird that sings</i>

18
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,364
<i>* He made their glowing colours</i>

19
00:02:25,492 --> 00:02:29,486
<i>* He made their tiny wings</i>

20
00:02:29,617 --> 00:02:32,699
<i>* All things bright and beautiful</i>

21
00:02:32,826 --> 00:02:36,867
<i>* All creatures great and small</i>

22
00:02:36,993 --> 00:02:40,110
<i>* All things wise and wonderful</i>

23
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:43,989
<i>* The Lord God made them all</i>

24
00:02:44,118 --> 00:02:47,567
<i>* The purple-headed mountain</i>

25
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:51,033
<i>* The river running by</i>

26
00:02:51,161 --> 00:02:53,484
<i>* The sunset and the morning...</i>

27
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:28,776
"I stole milk from breakfast
and made butter in an old cocoa tin. "

28
00:03:29,913 --> 00:03:33,692
But I'm going to share it with the team
so it's only half a sin, really.

29
00:03:36,288 --> 00:03:40,281
And I had lustful thoughts
about the gardener's boy.

30
00:03:41,246 --> 00:03:44,493
But he was only here for the summer
and I never even spoke to him.

31
00:03:46,413 --> 00:03:47,796
Actually, I've...

32
00:03:47,997 --> 00:03:51,120
had rather a lot of lustful thoughts.

33
00:03:51,913 --> 00:03:54,152
Do I have to be sorry
for all of them?

34
00:03:54,954 --> 00:03:58,735
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

35
00:04:04,205 --> 00:04:07,406
- Did you tell him?
- Yes.

36
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,411
- Everything?
- Not everything.

37
00:04:09,538 --> 00:04:12,951
- Did you mention the book?
- And get Miss G into trouble?

38
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,830
They don't understand art
and culture.

39
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:19,120
It's stupid to ban books
that tell you the truth about life.

40
00:04:19,247 --> 00:04:22,115
I don't think it's wrong
to want to know about the real world.

41
00:04:23,372 --> 00:04:25,908
We can't stay pure forever.

42
00:04:27,874 --> 00:04:29,911
Come on, Rosie.

43
00:04:31,124 --> 00:04:32,699
I'm so hungry.

44
00:04:35,165 --> 00:04:37,701
Excuse me. Coming through.

45
00:04:37,831 --> 00:04:39,372
Excuse me.

46
00:04:39,499 --> 00:04:41,620
I said excuse me!

47
00:04:43,874 --> 00:04:45,415
Hello, team.

48
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,488
The new girl is arriving today.

49
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,331
Toast, fag.

50
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:07,081
Yes, Radfield?

51
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:10,324
Where's my butter?

52
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,831
On your toast.

53
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,411
Really? Where? Show me.

54
00:05:23,521 --> 00:05:25,449
How generous of you!

55
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:31,285
It's funny. I go to all the trouble
making butter for the team,

56
00:05:31,418 --> 00:05:34,036
and then I actually
expect to have it on my toast.

57
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:37,665
Sorry, captain.

58
00:05:38,668 --> 00:05:40,326
Do it again.

59
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:45,163
From edge to edge. Or I'll have you
on a fork over that fire.

60
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:52,334
I have to set the standards,
or everything goes to hell.

61
00:05:52,877 --> 00:05:54,334
Quick, she's coming.

62
00:05:57,086 --> 00:06:01,742
We have a new girl coming all the way
from Spain to join your team.

63
00:06:04,211 --> 00:06:07,576
And I want you to welcome her
on her arrival.

64
00:06:07,711 --> 00:06:10,911
I know you are not always pleasant
to new girls,

65
00:06:11,045 --> 00:06:13,615
but I want you to be particularly
nice to this girl

66
00:06:13,752 --> 00:06:15,744
because she's travelling
such a distance,

67
00:06:15,877 --> 00:06:18,875
from another country,
another background.

68
00:06:19,711 --> 00:06:22,199
She's also a Roman Catholic,

69
00:06:22,336 --> 00:06:25,500
but she will attend religious services
with the rest of you.

70
00:06:26,254 --> 00:06:28,327
I want you to be kind.

71
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:33,586
This girl is an aristocrat.
She is accustomed to the best.

72
00:06:38,254 --> 00:06:40,043
Yes, Miss Nieven.

73
00:06:40,795 --> 00:06:43,165
- Do you all understand?
- Yes, Miss.

74
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,711
Bugger.

75
00:06:54,129 --> 00:06:56,797
Roman Catholics are superstitious
and ignorant.

76
00:06:56,922 --> 00:06:59,409
That's why they have
those ghastly pictures of Christ

77
00:06:59,547 --> 00:07:02,295
bleeding with nails in his hands
and thorns on his head.

78
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,918
Catholic nuns bury their babies
in the backs of convent gardens.

79
00:07:06,047 --> 00:07:10,122
And then they're walled in, standing up.
Can't even sit down to die!

80
00:07:18,963 --> 00:07:21,879
- When's she arriving?
- I don't know and don't want to know.

81
00:07:23,923 --> 00:07:25,713
I hear the Spaniard is a gymnast.

82
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:29,204
I hardly see the relevance
of cartwheels to what we do.

83
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:33,334
Miss G allowed it, so I don't want
to hear another word about it.

84
00:07:36,007 --> 00:07:37,286
She's coming.

85
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,831
It's freezing in here!

86
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,252
What does Sunny Nieven do
with your parents' money?

87
00:07:48,298 --> 00:07:50,870
It's not going on the heating,
that's for sure.

88
00:07:51,007 --> 00:07:53,495
Must be throwing it away
on drink, girls?

89
00:07:55,132 --> 00:07:57,502
Fuzzy, why are you hanging
like a sack of spuds?

90
00:07:57,632 --> 00:07:59,209
I lost my bounce, Miss G.

91
00:07:59,341 --> 00:08:01,627
Laurel, give her some bounce.

92
00:08:06,425 --> 00:08:08,415
That's it. Feet together.

93
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:12,165
Arms straight, eyes forward.

94
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,245
You are sinew and muscle,
cutting through air and water.

95
00:08:16,382 --> 00:08:18,209
With grace, with form,

96
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:20,500
with agility!

97
00:08:22,675 --> 00:08:24,582
Fuzzy, you can do better than that.

98
00:08:24,716 --> 00:08:28,627
I had seconds of porridge and toast
for breakfast and now I feel a bit queer.

99
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,216
Fuzzy.

100
00:08:30,341 --> 00:08:33,707
Is that the most important thing
in life? Porridge?

101
00:08:33,842 --> 00:08:36,509
- No, Miss G.
- Then what is?

102
00:08:39,009 --> 00:08:41,676
- Think.
- God, Miss G.

103
00:08:41,801 --> 00:08:46,258
- No. Rosie?
- Being kind to all God's creatures?

104
00:08:46,384 --> 00:08:48,375
No, you're missing the point, dear.
Poppy?

105
00:08:48,509 --> 00:08:51,543
- Death.
- In life, Poppy!

106
00:08:51,677 --> 00:08:55,290
- Di?
- Desire, Miss G.

107
00:08:55,427 --> 00:08:56,919
Yes! Thank you, Radfield!

108
00:08:58,469 --> 00:09:01,880
The most important thing in life
is desire.

109
00:09:03,219 --> 00:09:08,339
You can achieve anything you want.
The world is yours for the taking.

110
00:09:08,469 --> 00:09:11,254
Nothing is impossible for you,
my girls.

111
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:14,087
All you need is to desire it.

112
00:09:15,344 --> 00:09:17,713
- Do you have desire?
- Yes, Miss G.

113
00:09:18,427 --> 00:09:23,298
If you have desire, nothing can stand
in your way. Aim high!

114
00:09:34,011 --> 00:09:38,052
'"We shall have a moment
of contemplation. "

115
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:39,607
I think we should hear

116
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:43,879
Mr. Shelley's thoughts
on excessive ambition.

117
00:09:44,803 --> 00:09:46,345
Poppy?

118
00:09:47,636 --> 00:09:50,386
"I met a traveller
from an antique land

119
00:09:50,513 --> 00:09:56,177
"who said: 2 vast and trunkless legs
of stone stand in the desert.

120
00:09:57,596 --> 00:10:02,301
"Near them on the sand, half sunk,
a shatter'd visage lies

121
00:10:02,429 --> 00:10:06,922
"whose frown and wrinkled lip
and sneer of cold command

122
00:10:07,054 --> 00:10:11,215
"tell that its sculptor
well those passions read

123
00:10:11,346 --> 00:10:15,423
"which yet survive,
stamp'd on these lifeless things,

00:10:15,554 --> 00:10:18,921
"the hand that mock'd them

128
00:10:35,931 --> 00:10:37,553
"Nothing beside remains

00:10:37,681 --> 00:10:41,296
"round the decay

130

"boundless and bare.

"The lone and level sands

132
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,431
Welcome!

133
00:11:05,474 --> 00:11:08,638
It's a pleasure to have you with us, dear.
Did you have a good journey?

134
00:11:11,724 --> 00:11:14,212
Come along.
Come along, George.

135
00:12:21,644 --> 00:12:23,184
Come along, dear.

136
00:12:39,062 --> 00:12:41,846
I pray the Lord my soul to keep,
and if I die before I wake...

137
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:01,551
strong conception that
I do groan withal. Thou art to die.

138
00:13:01,687 --> 00:13:03,725
Then Lord have mercy on me!

139
00:13:03,854 --> 00:13:07,267
- I say, amen!
- And have...

140
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,054
Look, new drip.

141
00:13:14,395 --> 00:13:16,102
With staff.

142
00:13:18,855 --> 00:13:20,846
See, she is a real princess!

143
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,802
Can't stop looking at her.
She's so beautiful.

144
00:13:39,938 --> 00:13:42,854
She's not beautiful.
She's funny looking.

145
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,346
Her face is all lopsided.
Her features are too big.

146
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,304
Poppy, you're prettier.

147
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:11,975
- I'm Di Radfield. I'm your captain.
- Fiamma Coronna.

148
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:16,066
You may have 5 things
on your nightstand.

149
00:14:16,191 --> 00:14:18,062
Then I shall do my very best.

150
00:14:22,024 --> 00:14:23,849
These are the rules.

151
00:14:23,982 --> 00:14:25,772
5 things.

152
00:14:26,691 --> 00:14:27,888
Listen.

153
00:14:29,816 --> 00:14:32,813
It's the sound of the world ending.

154
00:14:38,107 --> 00:14:43,097
During your brief stay with us,
Your Highness, the rules are:

155
00:14:43,234 --> 00:14:46,101
you must do up the top button
of your shirt when wearing your tie,

156
00:14:46,234 --> 00:14:50,274
and you must ask a teacher
or a prefect if you wish to remove it.

157
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,559
You may wear mufti on Sundays
after chapel and before high tea.

158
00:14:54,692 --> 00:14:59,563
And you are allowed
5 personal objects on display.

159
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:01,649
The rules are for everyone.

160
00:15:03,192 --> 00:15:08,099
No exceptions, no favourites, no pets.

161
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,937
What a cow!

162
00:15:30,902 --> 00:15:33,650
Mummy. Mummy.

163
00:15:33,778 --> 00:15:36,347
Mummy! Mummy!

164
00:15:45,216 --> 00:15:47,567
Do you want to wake the others?

165
00:15:48,778 --> 00:15:52,191
There's nothing wrong with you.
Go to sleep.

166
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,357
I thought I heard my mother
calling my name.

167
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:58,101
I thought she'd come to get me.
Thought I was going home.

168
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,436
Whoever you are, you're late.

169
00:16:48,572 --> 00:16:50,692
- That's Fiamma.
- The aristocrat.

170
00:16:52,072 --> 00:16:53,565
Should I curtsey?

171
00:16:55,655 --> 00:16:57,361
Why are you late, Fiamma?

172
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:00,937
It is not late.
It is not even 7.

173
00:17:02,447 --> 00:17:04,901
We'll see if you were worth
waiting for, then.

174
00:17:37,615 --> 00:17:39,441
Radfield sets the standard!

175
00:17:47,241 --> 00:17:49,231
What went through your head
as you did that?

176
00:17:49,366 --> 00:17:52,945
- Nothing. My mind went blank.
- Exactly!

177
00:17:53,075 --> 00:17:55,611
This is why we train, girls.

178
00:17:55,741 --> 00:18:00,364
The body learns, it memorises.
Your muscles know how to respond.

179
00:18:00,491 --> 00:18:04,734
Then you release your body
from your mind. It's purely physical.

180
00:18:04,866 --> 00:18:09,405
But there is poetry in such perfection.

181
00:18:10,534 --> 00:18:13,486
Right. Who wants to go next?

182
00:18:14,826 --> 00:18:16,366
Fuzzy.

183
00:18:24,785 --> 00:18:26,941
What's the matter with you, Fuzzy?

184
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,615
Thinking about the boys again?

185
00:18:29,743 --> 00:18:32,528
No, I'm thinking about my dive.

186
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,450
Don't think! Do!

187
00:18:49,702 --> 00:18:51,326
Fuzzy!

188
00:19:00,869 --> 00:19:02,411
Fiamma?

189
00:19:04,327 --> 00:19:07,362
It's too cold to dive.
Too cold to swim.

190
00:19:07,494 --> 00:19:09,865
It's not too cold for my girls.

191
00:19:09,994 --> 00:19:14,568
- This is winter in Spain.
- But this isn't Spain, is it?

192
00:19:15,162 --> 00:19:18,693
What are you afraid of?
Not as good as you look, perhaps?

193
00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:17,911
- Amazing!
- Well done, Fiamma.

194
00:20:31,749 --> 00:20:34,498
It seems the bar has been raised,
Radfield.

195
00:20:43,165 --> 00:20:44,539
Come on, Fiamma.

196
00:20:44,665 --> 00:20:47,782
Fiamma, we're your horses,
so you have to feed us.

197
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,698
- Tally-ho!
- Wait for me.

198
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:55,032
Apparently, Miss G has ended
her affair with Mr. Du Toit.

199
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,156
He's one of the fathers.

200
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:59,779
She wasn't in love with him,
it was purely physical.

201
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:02,701
- They were driven by their lust.
- Is that true?

202
00:21:02,834 --> 00:21:05,536
It's absolute tosh.
Lily, stop making a show of yourself.

203
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:09,613
And I saw Mr. Du Toit once.
He was very handsome.

204
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,491
Like a movie star.

205
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:14,202
He had big strong hands and blue eyes

206
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,911
that promised wild adventures.

207
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,913
So really, it's entirely possible

208
00:21:19,042 --> 00:21:21,614
that he and Miss G could have
given in to their desire.

209
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,457
I quite fancied him for myself.

210
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:26,785
Because older men know all
about female sexual ecstasy.

211
00:21:26,917 --> 00:21:30,164
Lily, I think one day
you shall have a first in sex.

212
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:34,625
What's that?

213
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:37,914
For my breathing.
It clears the passages.

214
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:46,914
It smells.
Like my grandmother's linen drawer.

215
00:21:48,211 --> 00:21:49,667
Come on, Rosie.

216
00:21:49,794 --> 00:21:51,584
You've got the black spot.

217
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:53,537
On your head.

218
00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:54,865
Black spot.

219
00:21:56,419 --> 00:21:59,203
- Didn't you notice?
- So what?

220
00:21:59,336 --> 00:22:01,491
It means you're going to die.

221
00:22:01,627 --> 00:22:04,412
I'd better go back
to the school then.

222
00:22:09,336 --> 00:22:11,576
She's obviously never read
"Treasure Island".

223
00:22:11,711 --> 00:22:14,116
She has no idea what you're on about.

224
00:22:14,252 --> 00:22:15,794
Poppy!

225
00:22:16,232 --> 00:22:19,084
Ooh-ah, it weren't me and
you can't prove a thing.

226
00:22:19,211 --> 00:22:24,164
Ooh-ah, mind my peg-leg.

227
00:22:24,295 --> 00:22:26,368
And my parrot.

228
00:23:04,338 --> 00:23:06,413
Spelling.

229
00:23:08,381 --> 00:23:10,003
Spelling.

230
00:23:11,442 --> 00:23:14,038
Fuzzy, grammar.

231
00:23:15,881 --> 00:23:20,585
- She reads our letters?
- Of course. What did you think?

232
00:23:22,589 --> 00:23:26,038
- Who's Pablo?
- A friend.

233
00:23:26,173 --> 00:23:30,213
- A boyfriend?
- A boy and a friend.

234
00:23:30,339 --> 00:23:33,919
- A prince?
- No. Regrettably.

235
00:23:34,048 --> 00:23:37,876
- Is that why you were banished?
- I was not banished.

236
00:23:38,007 --> 00:23:41,751
- Like Romeo and Juliet?
- Do it again.

237
00:23:41,882 --> 00:23:45,626
- And don't sound so down in the dumps.
- Yes, Miss.

238
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,044
Letters are greetings.

239
00:23:48,173 --> 00:23:52,001
Use this opportunity
to show your dear parents

240
00:23:52,133 --> 00:23:54,798
your fine penmanship
and turn of phrase.

241
00:23:55,758 --> 00:23:59,502
Don't harry them for tuck
and pocket money.

242
00:24:01,758 --> 00:24:02,836
- Is that for me?
- No.

243
00:24:02,965 --> 00:24:04,459
Are you sure?
I think I can see my name.

244
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,048
No. Shoo. Go on, off with you.

245
00:24:10,133 --> 00:24:12,088
Persephone Burls?

246
00:24:17,674 --> 00:24:19,547
Fuzzy, for you, I think.

247
00:24:19,674 --> 00:24:22,709
- Can't make head nor tail of the stamps.
- They're Egyptian.

248
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,423
Fiamma Coronna.

249
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:34,548
You see? You haven't been forgotten.

250
00:24:34,675 --> 00:24:36,631
That's all, I'm afraid, girls.

251
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:39,248
But I'm sure Fiamma won't mind
sharing her treasures.

252
00:24:40,675 --> 00:24:43,247
"Dear Persephone,
hope you're well and studying hard.

253
00:24:43,384 --> 00:24:46,417
"Daddy's taking up his post in Rhodesia
a week earlier than expected... "

254
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:48,376
Aren't you going to open it, then?

255
00:24:51,594 --> 00:24:55,337
- Here?
- Come on, show us. Let's see.

256
00:25:11,178 --> 00:25:12,634
Look at this!

257
00:25:18,095 --> 00:25:19,718
Go on.

258
00:25:22,678 --> 00:25:24,751
This is heaven.

259
00:25:27,553 --> 00:25:29,792
Fiamma, tell me the story again.

260
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:33,131
- I told you last night.
- I like it. Please.

261
00:25:33,261 --> 00:25:34,423
Please.

262
00:25:35,804 --> 00:25:39,713
There once was a king
and his beloved daughter.

263
00:25:39,846 --> 00:25:44,219
Together they explored distant lands.

264
00:25:44,346 --> 00:25:47,627
One day,
they encountered a sultan

265
00:25:47,762 --> 00:25:51,542
who offered the king
an extraordinary gift

266
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,589
in return for his daughter's hand.

267
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:58,672
A magical blue diamond.

268
00:26:00,346 --> 00:26:03,260
But the king was greedy

269
00:26:03,387 --> 00:26:05,378
and took both,

270
00:26:05,512 --> 00:26:10,336
the diamond and the Princess
back to his mighty castillo.

271
00:26:10,471 --> 00:26:13,884
But the Sultan came looking
for the Princess

272
00:26:14,013 --> 00:26:18,553
and begged her to fly away with him

273
00:26:18,681 --> 00:26:21,881
on a magical tapestry of silk.

274
00:26:29,722 --> 00:26:33,846
And the Princess was so intoxicated

275
00:26:33,972 --> 00:26:37,421
that she flew away with him

276
00:26:39,307 --> 00:26:41,261
never to be seen again.

277
00:28:33,436 --> 00:28:35,344
Can't sleep, Di?

278
00:28:37,561 --> 00:28:39,268
I was thinking of home.

279
00:28:47,394 --> 00:28:50,097
Would be a shame to waste
such a beautiful night.

280
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:53,012
Come on. We're going swimming.
Wake the others.

281
00:28:54,604 --> 00:28:56,144
Lily.

282
00:28:59,063 --> 00:29:02,393
- Laurel, wake up.
- Wake up. We're going swimming.

283
00:29:03,479 --> 00:29:05,968
Don't be ridiculous.
It's the middle of the night.

284
00:29:06,105 --> 00:29:09,137
It's a compulsory lesson.
You can't bunk. Get up!

285
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:12,851
What lesson?
What are you talking about?

286
00:30:02,523 --> 00:30:04,597
What are you waiting for?
Kingdom come?

287
00:30:09,356 --> 00:30:10,352
Lily!

288
00:30:23,691 --> 00:30:25,231
I'll splash you.

289
00:30:35,983 --> 00:30:39,146
- Got to swim faster than that.
- You're mother!

290
00:30:39,275 --> 00:30:41,729
- How do I play?
- Chase the mother fish. Chase Di.

291
00:30:41,858 --> 00:30:43,434
You're mother.

292
00:30:47,692 --> 00:30:50,097
- Who's mother now?
- You're mother.

293
00:31:12,609 --> 00:31:14,517
Miss G learnt this game in India.

294
00:31:15,527 --> 00:31:20,682
Really? I love India.
When were you there?

295
00:31:20,818 --> 00:31:22,097
A few years ago.

296
00:31:22,236 --> 00:31:26,016
Miss G, tell Fiamma about
how you rode on elephants with rajas!

297
00:31:26,152 --> 00:31:29,565
Di, we've all heard that story before.

298
00:31:29,693 --> 00:31:31,815
I'd rather hear
about Fiamma's adventures.

299
00:31:31,943 --> 00:31:36,401
I haven't had adventures.
I just travelled with my father.

300
00:31:36,528 --> 00:31:38,068
Miss G travelled alone.

301
00:31:39,403 --> 00:31:40,682
Really?

302
00:31:40,819 --> 00:31:43,901
I was a bit of a scandal in my day.

303
00:31:44,028 --> 00:31:46,564
I remember one captain
who was quite loath

304
00:31:46,694 --> 00:31:49,230
to having an unaccompanied woman
on board.

305
00:31:49,362 --> 00:31:53,769
It caused such a stir, I was forced
to disembark at the next port.

306
00:31:58,237 --> 00:31:59,942
Where else have you been, Fiamma?

307
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:06,106
Abyssinia, Somaliland, the Dodecanese.

308
00:32:06,237 --> 00:32:08,063
And Paris.

309
00:32:08,195 --> 00:32:10,400
Paris is filthy.

310
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:15,727
Do you care for Paris?

311
00:32:16,904 --> 00:32:19,108
I love to travel.

312
00:32:20,445 --> 00:32:23,811
One day I shall have to resume
my exploration of the world.

313
00:32:23,946 --> 00:32:26,269
It's in our blood, isn't it?

314
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:31,439
You're not like the other girls.

315
00:32:31,571 --> 00:32:34,902
They're still waiting
for their lives to begin.

316
00:32:35,029 --> 00:32:36,986
But not you.

317
00:32:42,322 --> 00:32:44,313
But you can go whenever you choose.

318
00:32:48,448 --> 00:32:49,904
Why do you stay?

319
00:32:53,448 --> 00:32:54,989
I stay for my girls, of course.

320
00:32:56,823 --> 00:33:00,898
When they leave, so shall I.

321
00:33:52,409 --> 00:33:54,731
This is out of bounds, Miss Gribben.

322
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:59,481
I had no idea. Nothing is locked.

323
00:33:59,616 --> 00:34:04,192
It is an honour system.
We respect confidentiality here.

324
00:34:04,326 --> 00:34:06,198
And I thought
you would have known that.

325
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:11,780
Quite a scandal though, wasn't it?

326
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:16,068
A countess stealing away with
a peasant. And a Marxist, to boot!

327
00:34:16,201 --> 00:34:18,985
Imagine the daring, the courage.

328
00:34:19,117 --> 00:34:21,820
That is neither here nor there.

329
00:34:21,952 --> 00:34:26,608
We have had to protect many girls
from themselves over the years.

330
00:34:26,744 --> 00:34:31,447
I just felt if I knew a little of her
history, I could be of more help.

331
00:34:32,827 --> 00:34:37,568
All our girls are to be treated equally,
regardless of their past.

332
00:34:37,702 --> 00:34:40,072
As you well know, Miss Gribben.

333
00:34:42,744 --> 00:34:45,150
You have been with us a long time.

334
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:51,826
I'm sorry, Miss Nieven.

335
00:34:51,952 --> 00:34:54,737
It was an error of judgement.
It won't happen again.

336
00:34:54,869 --> 00:34:57,358
See that it doesn't.

337
00:34:59,702 --> 00:35:02,239
The world is a perilous place.

338
00:35:02,369 --> 00:35:06,494
It would be a shame for you
to have to find that out firsthand.

339
00:35:36,288 --> 00:35:40,496
So have you decided?
Is it a centre-piece for a dinner party?

340
00:35:41,704 --> 00:35:44,489
Or a christening?

341
00:35:44,621 --> 00:35:48,994
Or a simple 'get well' arrangement
for an ailing relative.

342
00:35:49,121 --> 00:35:53,945
Or have you any ideas of your own?
You can be creative.

343
00:35:57,289 --> 00:36:00,452
The world falls at her feet
because she's an aristocrat.

344
00:36:00,581 --> 00:36:04,159
It's so unjust. So unearned.

345
00:36:07,831 --> 00:36:10,237
Fuzzy Burls, what have you done?

346
00:36:10,373 --> 00:36:12,659
Fuzzy never gets any help.

347
00:36:16,373 --> 00:36:18,943
Did you hear? Your father
called for you on the telephone.

348
00:36:19,081 --> 00:36:22,329
- My father?
- The prince himself.

349
00:36:22,456 --> 00:36:23,831
Why wasn't I told?

350
00:36:23,956 --> 00:36:26,527
God knows where you were.
We looked everywhere for you.

351
00:36:26,664 --> 00:36:29,865
- In the end he had to speak to Lily.
- What did he say?

352
00:36:29,998 --> 00:36:33,778
Well... I think he took
quite a shine to Lily.

353
00:36:35,458 --> 00:36:37,364
He's arranged to see her next week.

354
00:36:37,498 --> 00:36:40,248
He's sending a carriage
and champagne for her.

355
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:44,282
Your father's a randy bugger, Fiamma.

356
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:47,829
He's going to deflower
our precious Lily.

357
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:50,739
You shouldn't be cruel.

358
00:36:53,791 --> 00:36:56,873
Excuse me, Miss Cairns.

359
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,784
I was wondering if I might take
advantage of the glorious sunshine

360
00:36:59,916 --> 00:37:02,536
and steal the girls away
for a dive.

361
00:37:02,666 --> 00:37:03,780
By all means.

362
00:37:06,751 --> 00:37:08,492
Fiamma, dear?

363
00:37:10,416 --> 00:37:13,036
If you don't mind, Miss Cairns,
I wish to stay.

364
00:37:14,668 --> 00:37:18,115
Fiamma, the great British summertime
rarely indulges us.

365
00:37:18,251 --> 00:37:23,585
It is barely past lunch.
I will get a cramp and sink like a stone.

366
00:37:27,793 --> 00:37:28,822
Suit yourself.

367
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,501
Girls.

368
00:37:45,918 --> 00:37:47,661
Last dive, girls.

369
00:37:47,793 --> 00:37:51,456
Show me something interpretive.

370
00:37:51,585 --> 00:37:55,117
"Puttin' On The Ritz"

371
00:37:55,253 --> 00:37:59,271
- Come on, be sexy, girls!
- Look, Miss G.

372
00:38:01,795 --> 00:38:05,159
- Well done, Fuzzy.
- Elephant. Poodle.

373
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:08,914
Chicken dance.

374
00:39:06,797 --> 00:39:08,704
No textbooks today, girls.

375
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:30,172
Ta-da!

376
00:39:31,882 --> 00:39:35,876
- Look at this!
- Look at this hat.

377
00:40:15,467 --> 00:40:19,958
Now, a story about Africa, I think.

378
00:40:21,259 --> 00:40:24,340
The last remains of the First Mate.

379
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:28,621
Mr. Riley I believe his name was.

380
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:32,503
He died in a mandrake swamp
on the way to the Congo Fran?ais.

381
00:40:32,635 --> 00:40:34,423
Poor Mr. Riley.

382
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:36,507
We were touring in a steamer,

383
00:40:36,635 --> 00:40:41,208
but he wanted to take a canoe
and explore deeper into the lagoon.

384
00:40:41,342 --> 00:40:45,965
A fascinating pursuit, but a pleasure
to be indulged with caution,

385
00:40:46,092 --> 00:40:48,547
for you are certain
to come across crocodiles.

386
00:40:49,927 --> 00:40:53,623
Taken, he was,
right out of the canoe.

387
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,335
It was a case of
'here one minute, gone the next'.

388
00:41:03,094 --> 00:41:04,965
Foolish man.

389
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:11,293
Probably spent his last moments
wondering why,

390
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,335
having reached this point of folly...

391
00:41:13,469 --> 00:41:15,175
he need have gilded the lily

392
00:41:15,302 --> 00:41:18,798
by fooling around in mangrove
swamps.

393
00:41:25,387 --> 00:41:28,302
You must have heard me
tell this one before.

394
00:41:29,594 --> 00:41:31,135
I believe I must.

395
00:41:35,887 --> 00:41:38,885
Nevertheless... we...

396
00:41:39,846 --> 00:41:41,882
we pushed on towards
the Ogowe River...

397
00:41:43,971 --> 00:41:46,969
plagued by mandrake flies.

398
00:41:47,096 --> 00:41:49,797
The stench of the swamp...

399
00:41:49,929 --> 00:41:52,880
Fairy tales. Like all her stories.

400
00:41:54,096 --> 00:41:56,418
Now not only are there crocodiles...

401
00:41:56,554 --> 00:41:58,260
Miss G has risked it all.

402
00:41:59,554 --> 00:42:04,259
She's fearless and true
and an example to everyone of us.

403
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:08,677
I think you'll find Mary Kingsley
risked it all in 1897.

404
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:11,800
A bestseller, I think.

405
00:42:11,931 --> 00:42:14,597
It was certainly translated into Spanish.

406
00:42:16,389 --> 00:42:21,177
...to exit and begin its external life.

407
00:42:26,472 --> 00:42:29,175
Come on, Laurel, you can do it.

408
00:42:32,806 --> 00:42:34,215
Come on, Poppy!

409
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:39,878
Fantastic, Laurel.

410
00:42:40,014 --> 00:42:41,969
Well done, Laurel.

411
00:43:25,016 --> 00:43:26,806
Where's your courage?

412
00:43:28,934 --> 00:43:31,257
Why? Why can't you give your all?

413
00:43:31,391 --> 00:43:34,260
Where is your poetry? Your passion?

414
00:43:35,476 --> 00:43:37,467
Why do I bother?

415
00:43:39,184 --> 00:43:40,842
Fiamma.

416
00:43:40,976 --> 00:43:42,847
We're not finished.

417
00:43:43,476 --> 00:43:45,347
Can we have another go, too?

418
00:43:45,476 --> 00:43:48,972
No. Fiamma has another dive in her.

419
00:43:50,101 --> 00:43:52,885
We shall all wait until she finds it.

420
00:43:59,684 --> 00:44:01,226
Fiamma.

421
00:44:52,853 --> 00:44:56,018
Where is she? Has she drowned?

422
00:44:56,146 --> 00:44:59,143
I'm not going to save her.

423
00:44:59,271 --> 00:45:01,806
She'll pop up like a cork
in a minute.

424
00:45:01,938 --> 00:45:06,181
Fiamma has an intrepid spirit.
Real mettle in her soul.

425
00:45:08,771 --> 00:45:11,603
Imagine possessing what she has.

426
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:16,139
How different
to this dull, aching existence.

427
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:20,724
Only Fiamma is willing to risk it all.

428
00:45:20,855 --> 00:45:23,806
To push herself beyond her boundaries.

429
00:45:31,773 --> 00:45:34,226
You may go and get changed.

430
00:45:39,731 --> 00:45:41,934
Circuits for the rest of you.

431
00:45:42,065 --> 00:45:43,722
It's not fair.

432
00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:10,268
That was top-notch today, Fiamma.

433
00:46:10,398 --> 00:46:13,018
Don't feel bad for the others,
you can't help being the best.

434
00:46:19,025 --> 00:46:20,896
We have a great deal in common,
you know.

435
00:46:24,775 --> 00:46:28,271
We have experienced so much,
you and I.

436
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,106
So much the same.

437
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:38,190
There's no reason why we shouldn't
be the best of friends.

438
00:46:52,733 --> 00:46:55,353
I don't understand
why we were punished with circuits.

439
00:46:55,485 --> 00:46:59,525
I did my best dive today,
and Miss G didn't even notice.

440
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,603
- I thought Laurel was very brave.
- Thank you.

441
00:47:02,735 --> 00:47:07,356
- So why are we in trouble?
- Fiamma set the standard.

442
00:47:07,485 --> 00:47:11,893
So? When you set the standard,
we weren't made to suffer.

443
00:47:42,695 --> 00:47:45,478
- What are you doing?
- We're drawing from life.

444
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:49,103
- Has anyone seen Fiamma?
- No.

445
00:47:50,737 --> 00:47:53,485
Have you not seen her anywhere?

446
00:47:54,278 --> 00:47:56,268
She's been in a bate
since this morning.

447
00:47:56,403 --> 00:48:00,184
- I thought it was more of a wuss.
- No, definitely a bate.

448
00:48:02,028 --> 00:48:04,268
Did you try the library
or the rough patch?

449
00:48:04,403 --> 00:48:06,478
I've done that twice now.

450
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:08,695
Twice...

451
00:48:14,737 --> 00:48:17,521
We should help look for her,
I suppose.

452
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,271
Come on.

453
00:48:23,987 --> 00:48:25,481
We're on a mission for Miss G!

454
00:48:25,612 --> 00:48:29,193
But it's so hot.
Can't we just stay here?

455
00:48:30,697 --> 00:48:32,735
Fine. I'll go on my own, then.

456
00:48:57,697 --> 00:48:59,818
Look, over there!

457
00:49:06,324 --> 00:49:07,567
There you are.

458
00:49:08,739 --> 00:49:10,945
Quite elusive today, aren't you?

459
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:13,773
Why must you follow me?

460
00:49:16,449 --> 00:49:18,688
We didn't finish
our conversation yesterday.

461
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,231
I've nothing to say to you.

462
00:49:24,032 --> 00:49:25,655
I see.

463
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:32,322
You know, you really should make
more of an effort to fit in.

464
00:49:32,449 --> 00:49:35,282
I will not be here
long enough to fit in.

465
00:49:38,449 --> 00:49:40,440
My father will come and get me.

466
00:49:41,449 --> 00:49:43,072
Of course, dear.

467
00:49:43,784 --> 00:49:46,271
But, you see, Laurel came for a term.

468
00:49:47,159 --> 00:49:50,523
So did Rosie. Fuzzy thought
she was going to be a day girl.

469
00:49:50,659 --> 00:49:53,326
Only Di realised this is forever.

470
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:02,445
It is not forever.

471
00:50:02,576 --> 00:50:04,117
They will leave you.

472
00:50:20,659 --> 00:50:22,733
...and a loaf for Matron, please.

473
00:50:25,534 --> 00:50:28,735
4 sugared rolls, 3 jam tarts
and a loaf for Matron, please.

474
00:50:28,869 --> 00:50:30,409
4 sugared rolls, 3 jam tarts...

475
00:50:51,911 --> 00:50:54,577
4 sugared rolls, 3 jam tarts
and a loaf for Matron.

476
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:59,483
4 sugared rolls, 3 jam tarts
and a loaf for Matron, please.

477
00:51:18,413 --> 00:51:19,786
Can I help you?

478
00:51:19,913 --> 00:51:23,360
4 sugared rolls, 3 jam tarts
and a loaf for Matron, please.

479
00:51:37,829 --> 00:51:39,572
Will that be all, Miss?

480
00:51:42,996 --> 00:51:44,193
Miss?

481
00:51:45,956 --> 00:51:50,114
And a... a quarter of lemon sherbets,
please.

482
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,831
I hope this makes
the homesickness go away.

483
00:52:57,125 --> 00:53:00,242
Nothing worse than feeling all alone
somewhere foreign.

484
00:53:01,291 --> 00:53:02,867
I know that feeling.

485
00:53:03,001 --> 00:53:07,125
And I know how important
even a small kindness can be.

486
00:53:10,083 --> 00:53:11,992
Fuzzy?

487
00:53:12,126 --> 00:53:16,036
I don't think that's a good idea, Burls.
You make too big a splash as it is.

488
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:24,288
It's not fair.

489
00:53:29,126 --> 00:53:32,492
Please. Help yourselves.

490
00:53:50,253 --> 00:53:52,125
What good is that going to do, Rosie?

491
00:53:52,253 --> 00:53:54,409
I don't have any money.

492
00:53:54,543 --> 00:53:56,333
Give us one of your shortbreads, then.

493
00:53:58,378 --> 00:54:02,454
Rosie, this is deadly serious.
Do as you are told.

494
00:54:14,961 --> 00:54:16,751
Good riddance!

495
00:54:28,128 --> 00:54:29,670
Come on.

496
00:54:32,378 --> 00:54:34,500
Right, let's find Fiamma.

497
00:54:48,838 --> 00:54:50,378
Get up!

498
00:54:51,213 --> 00:54:52,753
You're going home.

499
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:06,253
There's food, money and a map.

500
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:09,545
There's a ferry that leaves in an hour
so you need to get a move on.

501
00:55:09,672 --> 00:55:12,375
You do want to go home, don't you?

502
00:55:12,505 --> 00:55:16,713
Back to your villa and boyfriend
and the diamonds and parties?

503
00:55:18,005 --> 00:55:20,163
Thank you. I do.

504
00:55:28,173 --> 00:55:32,119
Don't come back!
I mean it, don't you ever come back!

505
00:55:40,423 --> 00:55:45,414
<i>* Your vows you've broken like my heart</i>

506
00:55:45,548 --> 00:55:50,289
<i>* Oh why did you so enrapture me?</i>

507
00:55:51,925 --> 00:55:56,416
<i>* Now I remain in a world apart</i>

508
00:55:56,550 --> 00:56:01,503
<i>* Though my heart
remains in captivity</i>

509
00:56:04,342 --> 00:56:06,829
Bath night for Fuzzy,
Laurel and Fiamma.

510
00:56:15,259 --> 00:56:17,960
- Where is Fiamma Coronna?
- I'll have her bath!

511
00:56:18,092 --> 00:56:19,882
No, you won't, Poppy.

512
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:22,340
Where is Fiamma?

513
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:25,257
Don't know, Matron.

514
00:56:27,425 --> 00:56:29,168
Hiding in the rose garden?

515
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:32,425
Di Radfield, where is she?

516
00:56:33,675 --> 00:56:37,835
I have no idea, Matron.
She's a law unto herself.

517
00:56:39,467 --> 00:56:43,960
<i>* And that yet once before I die...</i>

518
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:49,208
We have not had
an event like this in all my time.

519
00:56:49,344 --> 00:56:52,755
Our reputation is at stake.
Our own good name.

520
00:56:52,885 --> 00:56:54,710
I blame myself.
I have been too lenient.

521
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:57,711
In many ways the diving team
has been a great success.

522
00:56:57,844 --> 00:57:02,052
I do not wish to diminish
your great achievements with these girls

523
00:57:02,177 --> 00:57:05,543
when I say that they lack
a sense of proportion.

524
00:57:05,677 --> 00:57:09,293
Fiamma must learn that she is
no more special than any other child.

525
00:57:09,427 --> 00:57:11,050
I'll use a firmer hand.

526
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:15,005
Good. Now we must pray this child
returns to us unharmed.

527
00:57:15,887 --> 00:57:18,670
- Try it again, please.
- "Very well. "

528
00:57:26,554 --> 00:57:29,586
<i>"There's still no answer.
May I suggest you try later?"</i>

529
00:57:29,719 --> 00:57:33,797
I have to speak to him.
He has to come and get me.

530
00:57:34,387 --> 00:57:36,094
<i>"Please try again later. "</i>

531
00:58:05,097 --> 00:58:08,628
- Last crossing, Miss.
- No, thank you.

532
00:58:10,806 --> 00:58:12,880
I don't care for open water.

533
00:58:21,139 --> 00:58:22,679
Come.

534
00:58:24,556 --> 00:58:25,835
Miss G?

535
00:58:25,972 --> 00:58:29,255
We were all wondering
if there was any news.

536
00:58:29,389 --> 00:58:31,713
News? No.

537
00:58:34,347 --> 00:58:36,255
Perhaps she's returned to Spain.

538
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:41,597
How foolish if she has.
No one is missing her there.

539
00:58:45,474 --> 00:58:47,262
Why are you cross?

540
00:58:48,266 --> 00:58:51,097
I thought the team would be
better off without her.

541
00:58:52,266 --> 00:58:54,137
Well, you thought wrong!

542
00:58:56,141 --> 00:58:59,422
And when I want your opinion,
I'll ask for it.

543
00:59:38,726 --> 00:59:41,641
I don't think we need
to pursue this matter.

544
00:59:41,768 --> 00:59:43,806
She must've been
out in the cold for hours.

545
00:59:43,934 --> 00:59:48,427
We found her by the side of the road.
She was in such a state, poor girl.

546
00:59:50,934 --> 00:59:52,213
She's back!

547
00:59:53,184 --> 00:59:55,554
They caught her dodging a bus fare
on the mainland.

548
01:00:00,059 --> 01:00:01,173
Girls!

549
01:00:02,268 --> 01:00:03,298
Lights out!

550
01:00:22,019 --> 01:00:25,018
I'm really glad you came back.

551
01:00:48,396 --> 01:00:50,800
Fiamma! Come on, Fiamma!

552
01:01:05,563 --> 01:01:07,103
Amazing!

553
01:01:13,355 --> 01:01:15,429
Go on, Fuzzy.

554
01:01:16,313 --> 01:01:18,467
Girls, we are...

555
01:01:19,085 --> 01:01:20,864
angels,

556
01:01:21,168 --> 01:01:22,583
eagles.

557
01:01:23,813 --> 01:01:25,355
To dive is to fly.

558
01:01:36,606 --> 01:01:39,521
Set yourself free of the shackles
of conformity.

559
01:01:39,648 --> 01:01:44,222
Let nothing hold you back
except the air itself.

560
01:01:54,523 --> 01:01:58,184
You are between heaven and earth.

561
01:01:58,315 --> 01:02:00,721
The rules no longer apply.

562
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:20,521
I'm bored of practice.
When do we compete?

563
01:02:22,567 --> 01:02:25,518
We can have a little competition now
if you like.

564
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:29,228
No, I want to compete
against another team.

565
01:02:29,358 --> 01:02:30,981
Radfield, pick a team.

566
01:02:31,108 --> 01:02:32,436
Lily.

567
01:02:32,567 --> 01:02:34,474
Fiamma, you can be captain of team B.
Your turn to choose.

568
01:02:34,608 --> 01:02:35,639
Pick me!

569
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:38,478
Real competitions.
Against other schools.

570
01:02:38,608 --> 01:02:41,275
With prizes and trophies.

571
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:44,233
You do have trophies?

572
01:02:44,358 --> 01:02:47,108
- Miss G?
- We're training to compete.

573
01:02:47,233 --> 01:02:49,804
How many meets have you attended
with this team?

574
01:02:51,525 --> 01:02:52,900
None.

575
01:02:53,025 --> 01:02:54,733
None?

576
01:02:55,525 --> 01:02:56,722
We have never competed.

577
01:02:57,943 --> 01:02:59,139
You've never been ready.

578
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:04,565
- But I feel ready.
- I feel ready, too.

579
01:03:04,693 --> 01:03:06,731
What's the point if we don't compete?

580
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:09,608
I won't tolerate a mutiny.

581
01:03:09,735 --> 01:03:13,349
Since Fiamma seems to know what's
best for you, let her take the reins!

582
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:05,402
You shouldn't be so bloody superior
all the time.

583
01:04:05,528 --> 01:04:08,942
You're making her miserable, you know.
And ruining the team.

584
01:04:10,405 --> 01:04:12,360
If we're to be lumbered with you,

585
01:04:12,487 --> 01:04:15,983
you have to learn the happiness of the
team is more important than your own.

586
01:04:16,112 --> 01:04:19,230
I have no interest
in being part of your team.

587
01:04:19,362 --> 01:04:22,112
I'm not even meant to be here.

588
01:04:23,697 --> 01:04:25,070
Well, you're here now!

589
01:04:25,197 --> 01:04:29,237
So you had better make the best of it
and stop being so bloody selfish.

590
01:04:29,364 --> 01:04:33,226
I'm not selfish.
I just want to go home.

591
01:04:33,364 --> 01:04:36,195
Don't you think
we all want to go home?

592
01:05:51,784 --> 01:05:53,655
You can keep it if you like.

593
01:06:02,742 --> 01:06:04,284
Thank you.

594
01:06:11,952 --> 01:06:14,735
Maybe if I were kinder to Miss G,

595
01:06:14,867 --> 01:06:17,072
she would be kinder to you.

596
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:22,492
Maybe.

597
01:06:24,452 --> 01:06:25,992
I will try.

598
01:06:27,244 --> 01:06:29,115
No promises.

599
01:06:50,286 --> 01:06:52,692
Dreg in a midge wig.

600
01:06:55,702 --> 01:06:58,369
I'm bored. What should we do?

601
01:06:58,494 --> 01:07:00,615
We could play hide and seek?
Piggy in the middle?

602
01:07:00,744 --> 01:07:01,657
Red Rover?

603
01:07:01,786 --> 01:07:05,862
We should do something fun
for a change. Like a midnight feast.

604
01:07:07,161 --> 01:07:10,527
Fiamma, do you have
a suggestion for us?

605
01:07:15,788 --> 01:07:17,742
The feast of St. Agnes.

606
01:07:19,079 --> 01:07:23,867
On St. Agnes Eve, if a woman
performs certain divinations,

607
01:07:23,996 --> 01:07:27,610
she will see a vision
of her future husband

608
01:07:27,746 --> 01:07:30,070
and he will eat and drink with her.

609
01:07:31,746 --> 01:07:34,994
- Divinations are ungodly.
- Rosie, it's Keats.

610
01:07:35,121 --> 01:07:38,570
Brilliant! Some of us can be Madeline
and some Porphyro.

611
01:07:38,704 --> 01:07:40,945
We can dress up and have
a beadsman and a baledown.

612
01:07:41,079 --> 01:07:44,362
- Someone can hobble around.
- I'll be Porphyro with his steed.

613
01:07:44,496 --> 01:07:48,443
I'll be Madeline and pray
for a dream lover in the moonlight.

614
01:07:49,956 --> 01:07:52,527
Then it's decided.
Everyone must bring food.

615
01:07:52,664 --> 01:07:54,903
And we shall need flowers
for our hair.

616
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:57,030
We're going to have so much fun.
You'll see.

617
01:08:01,456 --> 01:08:04,074
Then, of course,
the 5th form was just lovely,

618
01:08:04,206 --> 01:08:07,322
lashings and lashings of cut flowers.

619
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:51,912
- Have I missed it?
- Come on, it's starting.

620
01:08:55,958 --> 01:08:59,158
Those are good.
Will you help with the Madelines?

621
01:09:01,626 --> 01:09:03,000
Somebody do my hair.

622
01:09:05,333 --> 01:09:07,454
Everyone looks so marvellous.

623
01:09:12,501 --> 01:09:14,574
It's like that.

624
01:09:23,627 --> 01:09:24,657
Bless you.

625
01:09:58,627 --> 01:10:01,710
- How do I look?
- Exquisite.

626
01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:05,252
Di, come over here.

627
01:10:17,587 --> 01:10:20,420
Even more tinned peaches!

628
01:10:24,421 --> 01:10:26,909
Laurel, can I have one
of your toffees, please?

629
01:10:28,253 --> 01:10:30,872
I could not get to sleep.
I just couldn't sleep.

630
01:10:35,796 --> 01:10:37,337
Rosie!

631
01:10:40,171 --> 01:10:42,837
Fiamma, you've kissed a boy,
haven't you?

632
01:10:42,962 --> 01:10:44,207
I have.

633
01:10:44,337 --> 01:10:46,827
Tell me how to do it. In detail.

634
01:10:46,963 --> 01:10:49,877
It can't be taught. You must practise
on the back of your hand.

635
01:10:50,755 --> 01:10:53,622
Or on the gardener's boy!

636
01:10:55,381 --> 01:10:57,003
Such amateurs.

637
01:10:57,131 --> 01:10:59,880
Listen, it's all very well to moon
after a pash,

638
01:11:00,006 --> 01:11:03,786
but there comes a time
when you have to grow up

639
01:11:03,922 --> 01:11:06,078
and find a proper man
and get your knickers off!

640
01:11:11,922 --> 01:11:14,210
Because you know all about that,
don't you, Lily?

641
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:15,832
Fuzzy!

642
01:11:55,757 --> 01:11:57,298
It's quite a noise, isn't it?

643
01:11:57,425 --> 01:11:59,498
It's a midnight feast.

644
01:11:59,632 --> 01:12:02,833
But food is not permitted in dormitories.

645
01:12:02,966 --> 01:12:06,083
They asked me for permission
and I allowed it.

646
01:12:06,216 --> 01:12:08,752
It is not for you
to grant such permission.

647
01:12:08,884 --> 01:12:12,213
Go to bed, old woman.

648
01:12:12,341 --> 01:12:15,542
Miss Nieven will hear of this.

649
01:12:41,719 --> 01:12:43,377
I feel so funny.

650
01:13:26,429 --> 01:13:29,592
- Come on, Fiamma, help us out.
- Someone's coming.

651
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:33,417
- Drag her to the bed, quick.
- Shut up, it's not funny.

652
01:13:42,387 --> 01:13:46,677
Sorry, Miss G. We didn't know
she'd had so much to drink.

653
01:13:48,095 --> 01:13:51,011
See that this room
is put back together.

654
01:13:52,887 --> 01:13:55,127
And clean yourselves up.

655
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:57,054
You look a fright.

656
01:14:09,305 --> 01:14:12,007
I shall hide her until she's sober.

657
01:14:12,139 --> 01:14:15,090
It will do none of us any good
if she's discovered in this state.

658
01:14:20,515 --> 01:14:23,761
- Sorry, Miss G.
- Thank you, Miss G.

659
01:14:23,890 --> 01:14:25,430
Thank you.

660
01:14:26,015 --> 01:14:27,555
Sorry.

661
01:14:47,474 --> 01:14:49,796
I would do anything for you.

662
01:14:52,849 --> 01:14:55,171
You do know that, don't you?

663
01:14:57,640 --> 01:15:00,757
We're going to be great friends,
you and I.

664
01:15:01,432 --> 01:15:04,003
And share simply everything.

665
01:15:08,516 --> 01:15:11,349
We'll see the world together.

666
01:15:12,516 --> 01:15:14,056
We...

667
01:15:15,141 --> 01:15:18,921
We will ride with bandits
in South America

668
01:15:19,059 --> 01:15:22,555
with rough diamonds
hidden in our saddles.

669
01:15:24,641 --> 01:15:26,846
There are islands, you know,

670
01:15:26,975 --> 01:15:29,725
where there are undiscovered tribes,

671
01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:32,765
places no one has explored.

672
01:15:42,143 --> 01:15:44,097
We'll climb the canopies of Amazonas

673
01:15:44,226 --> 01:15:48,515
and talk of the life we've lived.

674
01:15:50,310 --> 01:15:52,845
Anything is possible, you know.

675
01:15:53,894 --> 01:15:57,305
But you have to learn... to share.

676
01:15:59,310 --> 01:16:01,634
You can't make friends beg.

677
01:16:56,688 --> 01:16:58,679
Don't make me beg.

678
01:17:42,523 --> 01:17:45,805
- Fuzzy?
- I'm waiting for Fiamma.

679
01:17:57,649 --> 01:18:04,972
<i>* O joyful light, for in thee only</i>

680
01:18:05,108 --> 01:18:10,310
<i>* In trust we seek
and seeking find a way</i>

681
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:17,516
<i>* Strength of the tempted father
of the lonely</i>

682
01:18:17,649 --> 01:18:24,014
<i>* From out our darkness
bringest thou the day...</i>

683
01:18:40,150 --> 01:18:41,975
I can smell your sick.

684
01:18:42,109 --> 01:18:43,387
Sorry.

685
01:18:45,568 --> 01:18:50,688
If you need to heave,
do it where I can't see it or smell it.

686
01:19:04,569 --> 01:19:06,274
What do you think
they're talking about?

687
01:19:08,944 --> 01:19:12,475
- Maybe something they did last night.
- What do you mean?

688
01:19:14,235 --> 01:19:18,810
Fiamma's not a virgin, you know.
She's quite the little whore.

689
01:19:20,444 --> 01:19:25,314
She seduced that beastly foreigner
and now she's seduced our Miss G.

690
01:19:28,653 --> 01:19:32,100
- You're upsetting the others.
- I don't care.

691
01:19:32,235 --> 01:19:35,685
Let them be upset.
Let them see that I hate you.

692
01:19:37,944 --> 01:19:40,859
I want them to know
what you really are.

693
01:20:24,404 --> 01:20:26,395
Is everything all right, Miss G?

694
01:20:26,988 --> 01:20:28,979
Has something happened?

695
01:20:31,363 --> 01:20:34,030
I was thinking of resuming
my travels.

696
01:20:34,988 --> 01:20:36,779
In the holidays?

697
01:20:38,448 --> 01:20:40,237
And beyond.

698
01:20:40,948 --> 01:20:42,488
Miss G!

699
01:20:44,739 --> 01:20:47,310
There are parts of Asia
I would like to see.

700
01:20:48,989 --> 01:20:51,194
The silk route of Xi'an,

701
01:20:51,323 --> 01:20:53,527
the highlands of Tibet.

702
01:20:58,448 --> 01:21:00,523
You won't leave us.

703
01:21:05,198 --> 01:21:07,273
I have to leave.

704
01:21:08,573 --> 01:21:12,235
Fiamma wants to make it impossible
for me to stay.

705
01:21:12,365 --> 01:21:14,689
But what can she do?

706
01:21:21,490 --> 01:21:25,105
She intends to spread hateful lies
about me.

707
01:21:26,490 --> 01:21:30,436
She will destroy my reputation.
Do you understand?

708
01:21:37,574 --> 01:21:41,485
I am eyeless in Gaza,
betrayed to the Philistines.

709
01:22:24,868 --> 01:22:25,899
Come on.

710
01:22:51,078 --> 01:22:54,029
- Fiamma, get out!
- Go away.

711
01:22:54,162 --> 01:22:57,279
Di! You're being too rough!

712
01:23:03,787 --> 01:23:08,159
Miss G is leaving us,
and it's all Fiamma's fault!

713
01:23:08,287 --> 01:23:10,362
We are abandoned.

714
01:23:11,412 --> 01:23:13,403
What happened with Miss G last night?

715
01:23:15,037 --> 01:23:16,530
You have to tell us the truth.

716
01:23:16,662 --> 01:23:19,530
Were you playing St. Agnes Eve
with Miss G last night?

717
01:23:19,662 --> 01:23:21,819
You have to answer.

718
01:23:22,621 --> 01:23:24,742
I don't feel well.

719
01:23:24,872 --> 01:23:26,779
Not so fast Princess Fiamma.

720
01:23:26,912 --> 01:23:29,283
You have to tell us
what happened last night.

721
01:23:31,329 --> 01:23:33,404
What do you think happened?

722
01:23:34,704 --> 01:23:38,237
Did you do it with Miss G?
Did you do it for real?

723
01:23:38,372 --> 01:23:40,742
You're not a virgin, are you?

724
01:23:40,872 --> 01:23:43,573
You said you would be kind.
Not disgusting.

725
01:23:43,706 --> 01:23:46,372
You know what's happened.

726
01:23:46,997 --> 01:23:50,529
Look at what she has done to me!
Why can't you see it?

727
01:23:52,788 --> 01:23:54,779
- Liar!
- No!

728
01:23:55,539 --> 01:23:58,537
We have to tell someone
what she has done to me.

729
01:24:03,289 --> 01:24:04,747
No.

730
01:24:09,873 --> 01:24:12,539
- Take it back.
- No!

731
01:24:15,289 --> 01:24:16,912
That's not how you play.

732
01:24:22,623 --> 01:24:23,654
After her!

733
01:24:40,167 --> 01:24:42,122
Where did she go?

734
01:24:42,250 --> 01:24:43,992
I can see her. Follow me!

735
01:25:09,376 --> 01:25:11,864
We're coming to get you!

736
01:25:12,460 --> 01:25:14,036
Where are you?

737
01:25:14,167 --> 01:25:15,791
I can see her!

738
01:25:38,668 --> 01:25:40,956
You disgusting, horrible girl.

739
01:25:43,627 --> 01:25:48,581
Filthy girl!
We're going to teach you a lesson.

740
01:25:48,711 --> 01:25:50,618
You cow!

741
01:25:52,252 --> 01:25:54,576
- Leave me alone.
- Poppy, Di, stop, please!

742
01:25:54,711 --> 01:25:56,369
I can't breathe!

743
01:25:56,502 --> 01:26:00,034
Di, she's had enough.
Please, please stop it.

744
01:26:14,087 --> 01:26:16,872
Di. Di, what's wrong with her?

745
01:26:17,962 --> 01:26:19,502
What's wrong with her?

746
01:26:19,628 --> 01:26:22,199
Di, why does she sound like that?

747
01:26:29,505 --> 01:26:34,127
Go and get help.
Find Miss G, find anybody!

748
01:27:00,838 --> 01:27:02,795
Thank God I found it.

749
01:27:04,006 --> 01:27:08,248
I'll take it from here, Radfield.
Go and find Miss Nieven at once.

750
01:27:21,798 --> 01:27:24,796
Everything is going to be all right.

751
01:27:24,923 --> 01:27:26,796
I'm here now.

752
01:27:51,632 --> 01:27:54,750
Please, please.

753
01:27:54,882 --> 01:27:56,423
Please.

754
01:28:01,509 --> 01:28:03,048
Please.

755
01:28:07,759 --> 01:28:10,045
My beautiful child.

756
01:28:11,341 --> 01:28:13,048
My beautiful girl.

757
01:28:16,676 --> 01:28:19,708
I suppose you were not really meant
for this world.

758
01:28:22,385 --> 01:28:25,134
Go to sleep now.

759
01:28:25,260 --> 01:28:27,167
Go to sleep.

760
01:30:29,515 --> 01:30:31,885
We didn't mean it.

761
01:30:34,306 --> 01:30:36,511
We were just playing.

762
01:30:45,099 --> 01:30:46,970
What's going to happen, Di?

763
01:30:49,599 --> 01:30:53,462
Let's go and talk to Miss G.
Maybe she'll know what to do.

764
01:30:53,599 --> 01:30:56,551
We can tell her
we just wanted to give her a scare.

765
01:30:56,682 --> 01:30:59,800
Whatever we say, we did this.

766
01:30:59,932 --> 01:31:01,805
We're to blame.

767
01:31:03,057 --> 01:31:05,806
Please... stop.

768
01:31:12,725 --> 01:31:15,841
I have to tell you something.

769
01:31:46,101 --> 01:31:48,555
What can I do for you?

770
01:31:48,685 --> 01:31:52,893
I thought she was special.
Your favourite.

771
01:31:54,394 --> 01:31:56,136
Yes.

772
01:31:56,269 --> 01:31:57,975
It's a tragedy.

773
01:31:59,519 --> 01:32:01,344
But we shall move on.

774
01:32:01,476 --> 01:32:04,180
And we shall be as we once were,
a team.

775
01:32:10,810 --> 01:32:12,682
You don't deserve us.

776
01:32:22,645 --> 01:32:24,435
Is this a protest?

777
01:32:25,686 --> 01:32:28,175
You could have saved her.

778
01:32:28,311 --> 01:32:32,387
You need a scapegoat.
So, of course, it has to be me.

779
01:32:39,229 --> 01:32:41,220
You forget your part in this.

780
01:32:41,354 --> 01:32:43,842
Do you think you will be forgiven
for what you've done?

781
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:52,926
We don't ask for forgiveness.

782
01:33:01,938 --> 01:33:03,962
Nothing will come of you now!

783
01:33:04,167 --> 01:33:07,680
Your lights are extinguished!

784
01:33:18,189 --> 01:33:20,807
I appreciate your coming to see me,
Miss Radfield.

785
01:33:21,689 --> 01:33:25,101
We all feel we are in some way
to blame.

786
01:33:26,105 --> 01:33:30,645
But you must accept
that this was an act of God,

787
01:33:30,773 --> 01:33:35,063
and not allow rumour and hysteria
to tarnish this school's reputation.

788
01:33:39,148 --> 01:33:44,287
Miss Gribben will, however,
be taking a leave of absence

789
01:33:44,731 --> 01:33:47,018
to deal with this tragedy.

790
01:33:47,149 --> 01:33:50,100
Beyond that,
I consider this matter closed.

791
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:36,936
<i>Dear team. Please don't be cross
with me for leaving you in the lurch.</i>

792
01:34:37,068 --> 01:34:40,230
<i>There is no place here for me now.</i>

793
01:34:40,359 --> 01:34:42,350
<i>And I feel with great certainty</i>

794
01:34:42,484 --> 01:34:45,186
<i>that I must chance
to make a discovery of my own.</i>

795
01:34:47,984 --> 01:34:51,350
<i>I'm not sure I will come across
elephants or crocodiles immediately,</i>

796
01:34:53,818 --> 01:34:56,733
<i>but I shall write and tell you
the minute I do.</i>

797
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:11,145
<i>You must look after each other now</i>

798
01:35:11,277 --> 01:35:14,974
<i>and do your best
to be fearless and true.</i>

799
01:35:15,110 --> 01:35:17,350
<i>Carry these notions
forth into the world,</i>

800
01:35:17,485 --> 01:35:20,484
<i>because without you
they will simply disappear.</i>

801
01:35:24,653 --> 01:35:28,149
<i>Don't fret.
I will write soon and...</i>

802
01:35:28,860 --> 01:35:32,393
<i>I promise to replace
the shortbreads.</i>

803
01:35:33,569 --> 01:35:35,275
<i>Love, Di.</i>
