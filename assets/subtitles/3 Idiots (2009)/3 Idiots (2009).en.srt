00:01:33,331 --> 00:01:34,401
Hello

2
00:01:35,531 --> 00:01:36,567
Yes?

3
00:01:39,611 --> 00:01:40,521
What?

4
00:01:40,652 --> 00:01:42,370
Sir, kindly switch off your
mobile phone

5
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,530
Just one sec, please

6
00:01:54,932 --> 00:01:55,966
Excuse me

7
00:02:14,692 --> 00:02:15,646
Excuse me

8
00:02:15,891 --> 00:02:16,926
Sir, please sit down

9
00:02:26,611 --> 00:02:28,091
Captain, there's a
medical emergency

10
00:02:28,211 --> 00:02:29,930
A passenger has just
fallen down in the aisle

11
00:02:30,051 --> 00:02:32,805
Delhi, Air India 101 returning
due to medical emergency

12
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:42,288
Excuse me, sir

13
00:02:54,292 --> 00:02:55,326
Hold on!

14
00:03:04,731 --> 00:03:08,485
I'm fine now, thanks.
Carry on, please

15
00:03:09,931 --> 00:03:11,205
Wait

16
00:03:39,891 --> 00:03:42,610
Get the car.
- Mr. Dhillon?

17
00:03:42,891 --> 00:03:45,042
Want the name tattooed?
Get the car

18
00:03:48,051 --> 00:03:48,882
To the hotel, sir?

19
00:03:49,132 --> 00:03:51,646
Yes, yes, but via Vasant Vihar

20
00:03:53,812 --> 00:03:55,324
Step on the gas, dude!

21
00:04:07,412 --> 00:04:08,561
Yeah, Farhan?

22
00:04:08,692 --> 00:04:11,080
Get ready. I'll pick you up
in five minutes

23
00:04:11,331 --> 00:04:12,241
What happened?

24
00:04:12,532 --> 00:04:14,204
Chatur called. Remember him?

25
00:04:14,972 --> 00:04:16,165
The 'Silencer'?

26
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:17,207
Yeah

27
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:20,610
He said Rancho is coming

28
00:04:22,731 --> 00:04:23,608
What?

29
00:04:23,771 --> 00:04:27,321
He said: Come to the campus at 8.
On the tank

30
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:29,762
Oh shucks!

31
00:04:29,891 --> 00:04:30,768
Hurry.

32
00:04:30,932 --> 00:04:32,047
Ok

33
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:40,005
Honey, I'll be back soon.
Oh, shoes

34
00:04:41,012 --> 00:04:42,000
We found our buddy

35
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:45,481
What?

36
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:47,771
Tell me later, bye

37
00:04:48,692 --> 00:04:50,011
You forgot your pants

38
00:05:00,012 --> 00:05:00,966
Now to the hotel, sir?

39
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:04,050
Yes, but via
Imperial College of Engineering

40
00:05:04,612 --> 00:05:05,487
Ok sir

41
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:06,482
Forgot my socks

42
00:05:07,252 --> 00:05:08,321
More than just your socks

43
00:05:08,531 --> 00:05:10,124
Your pants

44
00:05:10,372 --> 00:05:11,201
Oh no

45
00:05:23,091 --> 00:05:26,288
Now get my brother
from the airport

46
00:05:26,411 --> 00:05:27,560
Same last name: Dhillon

47
00:05:27,731 --> 00:05:31,168
This is Dhillon.
Where's my cab? On the runway?

48
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:51,682
Hey Rancho

49
00:05:51,891 --> 00:05:53,404
Hey Chatur, where's Rancho?

50
00:05:54,012 --> 00:05:55,286
Rancho

51
00:05:56,132 --> 00:05:57,042
Where's Rancho?

52
00:05:57,651 --> 00:05:59,643
Welcome, idiots

53
00:06:03,971 --> 00:06:05,120
Some 'madeira' for you?

54
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:09,689
The same rum you
guzzled those days

55
00:06:10,492 --> 00:06:11,526
Have a drink

56
00:06:12,252 --> 00:06:13,321
Where is Rancho?

57
00:06:13,771 --> 00:06:16,968
Patience. First look at this

58
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:21,204
Don't eye my wife. Check out
the mansion behind, idiots

59
00:06:21,651 --> 00:06:23,370
$ 3.5 million

60
00:06:24,572 --> 00:06:26,369
Swimming pool: heated.

61
00:06:27,252 --> 00:06:29,526
Living room: maple wood flooring

62
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:33,242
My new Lambhorghini 6496 cc -

63
00:06:34,012 --> 00:06:34,966
very fast

64
00:06:35,132 --> 00:06:37,043
Why're you showing us all this?

65
00:06:37,692 --> 00:06:38,521
Forgot?

66
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,481
What's this?

67
00:06:43,012 --> 00:06:44,808
'5th September'. Today's date

68
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:03,644
I challenge you

69
00:07:03,932 --> 00:07:05,968
We'll meet again after ten years

70
00:07:06,331 --> 00:07:08,242
Same day. Same place

71
00:07:08,771 --> 00:07:11,365
We'll see who's more successful

72
00:07:11,771 --> 00:07:16,242
Have the balls? C'mon, bet;

73
00:07:16,851 --> 00:07:21,687
Remember? I'd challenged
that idiot right here

74
00:07:22,172 --> 00:07:25,163
I kept my promise. I'm back

75
00:07:25,971 --> 00:07:29,759
Jackass; I aborted a flight,
he forgot his pants

76
00:07:29,851 --> 00:07:30,920
all to meet Rancho

77
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:33,846
5 years we've searched.
Don't know if he's alive

78
00:07:33,971 --> 00:07:36,531
and you think he'll show up
for your silly bet

79
00:07:36,731 --> 00:07:40,691
I know he won't show up

80
00:07:41,331 --> 00:07:43,084
You gonna break his jaw
or should I

81
00:07:44,812 --> 00:07:46,165
So why'd you call us here?

82
00:07:46,292 --> 00:07:47,485
To meet Rancho

83
00:07:47,891 --> 00:07:51,850
Come and see where I've reached
and where he rots

84
00:07:52,012 --> 00:07:53,331
So you know where Rancho is?

85
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,370
Yes

86
00:07:57,771 --> 00:07:58,648
Where?

87
00:07:59,851 --> 00:08:01,569
He is in Shimla

88
00:08:07,172 --> 00:08:12,564
Free as the wind was he

89
00:08:14,012 --> 00:08:19,132
Like a soaring kite was he

90
00:08:20,932 --> 00:08:26,802
Where did he go... let's find him

91
00:08:41,292 --> 00:08:44,283
Free as the wind was he

92
00:08:46,172 --> 00:08:49,288
Like a soaring kite was he

93
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:54,567
Where did he go... let's find him

94
00:08:57,491 --> 00:09:00,688
We were led by the path we took

95
00:09:00,892 --> 00:09:03,928
While he carved a path of his own

96
00:09:04,131 --> 00:09:09,285
Stumbling, rising, carefree walked he

97
00:09:10,692 --> 00:09:13,842
We fretted about the morrow

98
00:09:14,091 --> 00:09:17,083
He simply reveled in today

99
00:09:17,331 --> 00:09:22,803
Living each moment to the fullest

100
00:09:24,091 --> 00:09:27,208
Where did he come from...

101
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:34,240
He who touched our hearts
and vanished...

102
00:09:37,172 --> 00:09:40,607
Where did he go... let's find him

103
00:09:46,772 --> 00:09:50,081
In scorching Sun,
he was like a patch of shade...

104
00:09:50,251 --> 00:09:53,323
In an endless desert, like an oasis...

105
00:09:53,572 --> 00:09:58,123
On a bruised heart,
like soothing balm was he

106
00:10:00,091 --> 00:10:03,208
Afraid, we stayed confined in the well

107
00:10:03,371 --> 00:10:06,408
Fearless, he frolicked in the river

108
00:10:06,611 --> 00:10:11,890
Never hesitating to swim
against the tide

109
00:10:13,491 --> 00:10:16,643
He wandered lonesome as a cloud

110
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,602
...Yet he was our dearest friend

111
00:10:23,292 --> 00:10:26,567
Where did he go... let's find him

112
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:27,721
Rancho

113
00:10:28,131 --> 00:10:30,201
Ranchhoddas Shamaldas Chanchad

114
00:10:30,932 --> 00:10:34,004
He was as unique as his name

115
00:10:34,692 --> 00:10:37,411
From birth we were taught -
Life is a race

116
00:10:37,812 --> 00:10:40,724
Run fast or you 'll be trampled

117
00:10:41,731 --> 00:10:45,087
Even to be born, one had to race
300 million sperms

118
00:10:47,251 --> 00:10:50,721
1978. I was born at 5.15 pm

119
00:10:51,172 --> 00:10:53,845
At 5.16, my father announced

120
00:10:54,011 --> 00:10:58,369
My son will be an engineer.
- Farhan Qureshi. B.Tech. Engineer

121
00:10:58,572 --> 00:10:59,924
And my fate was sealed

122
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:05,205
What I wanted to be... no one asked

123
00:11:26,532 --> 00:11:29,091
Raju Rastogi...
Ranchhoddas Chanchad

124
00:11:30,772 --> 00:11:31,648
Room number?

125
00:11:34,491 --> 00:11:35,368
D-26

126
00:11:37,052 --> 00:11:37,961
C'mon

127
00:11:38,211 --> 00:11:39,850
I'm Man Mohan. MM

128
00:11:40,211 --> 00:11:41,769
These engineers call me
Millimeter

129
00:11:42,131 --> 00:11:44,326
For eggs, bread, milk, laundry

130
00:11:44,451 --> 00:11:46,124
finishing journals,
copying assignments

131
00:11:46,371 --> 00:11:49,727
I'm your guy. Fixed rates.
No bargaining

132
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,809
Hey wait, hold this

133
00:11:54,251 --> 00:11:57,846
Meet Kilobyte, Megabyte,
and their mother Gigabyte

134
00:11:57,971 --> 00:11:59,849
Go ahead, click -
this family doesn't bite

135
00:12:05,932 --> 00:12:08,048
Check him out...
another God-fearing soul

136
00:12:12,652 --> 00:12:14,768
Hi. Farhan Qureshi
- I'm Raju Rastogi

137
00:12:19,052 --> 00:12:20,041
Don't worry

138
00:12:20,692 --> 00:12:24,287
a few days here and
hell lose faith in God

139
00:12:25,292 --> 00:12:28,090
Then naked babes will be
on the wall, and he'll say -

140
00:12:28,731 --> 00:12:31,451
Oh God,
give me one chance with her

141
00:12:32,011 --> 00:12:33,126
Get out of here

142
00:12:33,772 --> 00:12:35,888
Four bucks. Two per bag

143
00:12:38,011 --> 00:12:39,683
Here's five. Keep the change

144
00:12:40,011 --> 00:12:43,971
Thanks boss. For your tip,
here's one in return -

145
00:12:45,011 --> 00:12:47,970
Wear your best underwear tonight

146
00:12:50,292 --> 00:12:51,280
Why?

147
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:55,724
Your Majesty, thou art great

148
00:12:56,652 --> 00:12:58,802
Accept this humble offering

149
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:00,842
Ha... here's a He-Man

150
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:06,320
What a pretty piece.
Cute and compact

151
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:08,051
A campus tradition: On Day 1...

152
00:13:09,251 --> 00:13:10,650
Freshmen must pay
their respects to Seniors

153
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:12,924
in their underwear

154
00:13:13,572 --> 00:13:16,325
This is when we first saw Rancho

155
00:13:25,491 --> 00:13:26,368
Spiderman

156
00:13:26,851 --> 00:13:27,727
Batman

157
00:13:34,052 --> 00:13:36,884
Fresh meat

158
00:13:37,172 --> 00:13:40,322
Greetings.
Drop your pants, get stamped

159
00:13:40,412 --> 00:13:41,241
Name?

160
00:13:41,331 --> 00:13:43,004
'Ranchhoddas Shamaldas Chanchad'

161
00:13:44,211 --> 00:13:47,009
What a mouthful;
Needs serious cramming

162
00:13:47,812 --> 00:13:48,721
Come on: pants off

163
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,879
Being stubborn?

164
00:13:58,172 --> 00:14:00,527
Wet pants not good, kiddo.
Take them off

165
00:14:01,851 --> 00:14:03,570
Aal izz well

166
00:14:03,731 --> 00:14:05,245
Aal izz Well

167
00:14:05,331 --> 00:14:06,207
What did he say?

168
00:14:06,652 --> 00:14:09,404
Someone tell him.
Hey James Bond

169
00:14:09,692 --> 00:14:10,681
Make him understand

170
00:14:12,211 --> 00:14:14,442
Take off your pants or
they are going to piss on you

171
00:14:14,572 --> 00:14:17,005
Hey 007!
Ashamed to speak Hindi?

172
00:14:17,091 --> 00:14:20,528
Sorry sir, I was born in Uganda,
studied in Pondicherry

173
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:22,010
so little slow in Hindi

174
00:14:22,131 --> 00:14:25,168
So explain slowly. No hurry

175
00:14:27,412 --> 00:14:28,447
Feeling cold?

176
00:14:29,172 --> 00:14:31,128
Pray undress

177
00:14:31,692 --> 00:14:36,082
or he'll do
'urine-expulsion' on you

178
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:38,884
Calls pissing 'urine-expulsion';

179
00:14:40,331 --> 00:14:42,606
A true linguist
in the land of engineers!

180
00:14:47,932 --> 00:14:49,524
Hey, come out of there

181
00:14:57,692 --> 00:14:58,681
Come out or...

182
00:14:59,772 --> 00:15:02,808
or I'll do 'urine-expulsion'
on your door

183
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:13,889
If you aren't out by
the count of ten

184
00:15:14,652 --> 00:15:19,009
I'll do 'urine-expulsion'
on your door all semester

185
00:15:22,692 --> 00:15:23,601

186
00:15:26,572 --> 00:15:27,890
Two

187
00:15:34,052 --> 00:15:35,086
Three

188
00:15:45,131 --> 00:15:46,485
Four

189
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:51,486
Five

190
00:15:57,451 --> 00:15:58,725
Six

191
00:16:04,812 --> 00:16:05,927
Seven

192
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:13,240
Eight

193
00:16:18,172 --> 00:16:19,321
Nine

194
00:16:28,412 --> 00:16:29,605
Ten

195
00:17:13,571 --> 00:17:17,929
Salt water is a great conductor
of electricity. 8th Grade Physics

196
00:17:18,491 --> 00:17:21,006
We had studied it.
He applied it

197
00:17:26,051 --> 00:17:29,885
Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe
was the Director of ICE

198
00:17:30,332 --> 00:17:33,243
Students called him Virus,
computer Virus

199
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:36,086
Virus on the way, with eggs

200
00:17:36,332 --> 00:17:39,721
Freshmen are summoned.
Come quickly

201
00:17:40,011 --> 00:17:42,480
Virus was the most competitive
man we had ever seen

202
00:17:43,211 --> 00:17:46,682
He couldn 't bear anyone
getting ahead of him

203
00:17:50,251 --> 00:17:53,403
To save time,
his shirts had Velcro

204
00:17:53,692 --> 00:17:55,010
and his ties had hooks

205
00:17:57,372 --> 00:18:01,330
He'd trained his mind to write
with both hands simultaneously

206
00:18:04,811 --> 00:18:08,724
Everyday at 2 pm he took a
7 1/2 minute power nap

207
00:18:09,132 --> 00:18:10,326
with an opera as lullaby

208
00:18:13,412 --> 00:18:14,810
Govind, his valet, had instructions

209
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:20,803
to carry out all unproductive tasks
such as shaving, nail-cutting etc

210
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,601
What is this?
- Sir, nest

211
00:18:39,692 --> 00:18:41,922
Whose?
- A koel bird's nest, sir

212
00:18:42,011 --> 00:18:42,967
Wrong

213
00:18:44,211 --> 00:18:45,769
A koel bird never makes
her own nest

214
00:18:46,811 --> 00:18:49,166
She lays her eggs in
other nests

215
00:18:51,051 --> 00:18:53,849
And when they hatch,
what do they do?

216
00:18:55,692 --> 00:19:01,130
They push the other eggs
out of the nest

217
00:19:04,932 --> 00:19:05,886
Competition over

218
00:19:07,172 --> 00:19:10,561
Their life begins with murder.
That's nature

219
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:13,846
Compete or die

220
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:17,761
You also are like the koel birds

221
00:19:21,971 --> 00:19:26,124
And these are the eggs
you smashed to get into ICE

222
00:19:26,571 --> 00:19:31,362
Don't forget, ICE gets
400,000 applications a year

223
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:35,723
and only 200 are selected: You;

224
00:19:36,332 --> 00:19:40,769
And these? Finished.
Broken eggs

225
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:45,207
My son... he tried for three years

226
00:19:47,332 --> 00:19:49,448
Rejected. Every time

227
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:53,250
Remember, life is a race

228
00:19:54,211 --> 00:19:57,328
If you don't run fast,
you'll get trampled

229
00:19:58,011 --> 00:19:59,808
Let me tell you a
very interesting story

230
00:20:02,011 --> 00:20:03,205
This is an astronaut pen

231
00:20:04,451 --> 00:20:06,965
Fountain pens and ballpoint pens
don't work in outer space

232
00:20:07,771 --> 00:20:11,845
So scientists spent
millions to invent this pen

233
00:20:12,251 --> 00:20:16,325
It can write at any angle, in any
temperature, in zero gravity

234
00:20:16,692 --> 00:20:18,410
One day, when I was a student

235
00:20:18,731 --> 00:20:20,369
the Director of our institute
called me

236
00:20:20,771 --> 00:20:22,967
He said, 'Viru Sahastrabuddhe.'
I said, 'Yes sir'

237
00:20:23,092 --> 00:20:24,490
'Come here;'
I got scared

238
00:20:25,811 --> 00:20:26,961
He showed me this pen

239
00:20:28,412 --> 00:20:30,561
He said, 'This is a
symbol of excellence'

240
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:33,280
'I give it to you'

241
00:20:34,971 --> 00:20:38,806
'When you come across an
extraordinary student like yourself

242
00:20:39,451 --> 00:20:41,009
...pass it onto him'

243
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:46,204
For 32 years, I've been
waiting for that student

244
00:20:46,572 --> 00:20:47,686
But no luck

245
00:20:50,172 --> 00:20:52,322
Anyone here, who'll strive
to win this pen?

246
00:20:54,852 --> 00:20:56,843
Good.
Put your hands down

247
00:21:01,372 --> 00:21:03,646
Shall I post it on the notice board?
Hands down

248
00:21:04,132 --> 00:21:05,359
One question, sir

249
00:21:06,892 --> 00:21:10,123
Sir, if pens didn't work
in outer space

250
00:21:10,612 --> 00:21:13,172
why didn't the astronauts
use a pencil?

251
00:21:14,852 --> 00:21:15,967
They'd have saved millions

252
00:21:28,451 --> 00:21:29,851
I will get back to you on this

253
00:21:33,731 --> 00:21:35,882
He zaps a Senior's privates
at night

254
00:21:36,051 --> 00:21:39,202
fingers the Director in the day.
Best avoid him

255
00:21:39,412 --> 00:21:41,367
You deflated Virus's erection

256
00:21:41,572 --> 00:21:45,247
Your Majesty, thou art great.
Accept this humble offering

257
00:21:45,412 --> 00:21:47,721
Buzz off.
You don't have school?

258
00:21:48,051 --> 00:21:49,565
Who'll pay for it? Your pop?

259
00:21:49,652 --> 00:21:52,848
Keep off my dad!
- Relax

260
00:21:53,332 --> 00:21:56,688
For school you don't need
tuition money, just a uniform

261
00:21:56,892 --> 00:22:02,090
Pick a school,
buy the uniform, slip into class

262
00:22:02,771 --> 00:22:04,285
In that sea of kids,
no one will notice

263
00:22:04,892 --> 00:22:07,565
If I get caught?
- Then new uniform, new school

264
00:22:08,451 --> 00:22:09,851
See that?
- He was different...

265
00:22:10,332 --> 00:22:13,368
He challenged conventions
at every stage

266
00:22:13,971 --> 00:22:16,566
A free-spirited bird had
landed in Virus's nest

267
00:22:17,451 --> 00:22:20,204
We were robots, blindly following
our professors ' commands

268
00:22:20,852 --> 00:22:23,319
He was the only one
who was not a machine

269
00:22:23,491 --> 00:22:25,846
What is a machine?

270
00:22:30,971 --> 00:22:32,529
Why're you smiling?

271
00:22:34,132 --> 00:22:36,566
Sir, to study Engineering
was a childhood dream

272
00:22:37,372 --> 00:22:39,727
I'm so happy to be here finally

273
00:22:40,451 --> 00:22:43,967
No need to be so happy.
Define a machine

274
00:22:45,451 --> 00:22:48,603
A machine is anything that
reduces human effort

275
00:22:49,011 --> 00:22:50,330
Will you please elaborate?

276
00:22:53,771 --> 00:22:58,766
Anything that simplifies work,
or saves time, is a machine

277
00:23:00,571 --> 00:23:02,767
It's a warm day, press a button,
get a blast of air

278
00:23:02,852 --> 00:23:04,171
The fan... A machine;

279
00:23:04,811 --> 00:23:07,804
Speak to a friend miles away.
The telephone... A machine!

280
00:23:08,132 --> 00:23:10,930
Compute millions in seconds.
The calculator... A machine!

281
00:23:11,652 --> 00:23:13,528
We're surrounded by machines

282
00:23:14,051 --> 00:23:16,441
From a pen's nib to a pants' zip -
all machines

283
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:19,161
Up and down in a second.
Up, down, up, down...

284
00:23:21,852 --> 00:23:23,285
What is the definition?

285
00:23:24,011 --> 00:23:25,604
I just gave it to you, sir

286
00:23:27,211 --> 00:23:30,602
You'll write this in the exam?
This is a machine: up, down...

287
00:23:31,412 --> 00:23:33,288
Idiot; Anybody else?

288
00:23:33,971 --> 00:23:34,801
Yes?

289
00:23:35,051 --> 00:23:37,361
Sir, machines are any combination
of bodies so connected

290
00:23:37,451 --> 00:23:38,964
that their relative motions
are constrained

291
00:23:39,092 --> 00:23:41,401
and by which means, force
and motion may be transmitted

292
00:23:41,531 --> 00:23:43,727
and modified as a screw
and its nut, or a lever arranged

293
00:23:43,852 --> 00:23:46,412
to turn about a fulcrum
or a pulley about its pivot, etc

294
00:23:46,572 --> 00:23:48,528
especially, a construction,
more or less complex

295
00:23:48,612 --> 00:23:50,442
consisting of a combination
of moving parts, or

296
00:23:50,531 --> 00:23:53,729
simple mechanical elements,
as wheels, levers, cams etc

297
00:23:55,011 --> 00:23:55,922
Wonderful

298
00:23:56,211 --> 00:23:57,611
Perfect. Please sit down

299
00:23:57,852 --> 00:23:59,125
Thank you

300
00:24:00,652 --> 00:24:03,371
But sir, I said the same thing,
in simple language

301
00:24:03,571 --> 00:24:07,359
If you prefer simple language,
join an Arts and Commerce college

302
00:24:07,491 --> 00:24:09,288
But sir, one must get
the meaning too

303
00:24:09,852 --> 00:24:12,763
What's the point of blindly
cramming a bookish definition

304
00:24:13,011 --> 00:24:14,569
You think you're smarter
than the book?

305
00:24:14,932 --> 00:24:19,686
Write the textbook definition, mister,
if you want to pass

306
00:24:19,852 --> 00:24:21,523
But there are other books...
- Get out!

307
00:24:22,491 --> 00:24:23,720
Why?

308
00:24:23,892 --> 00:24:25,847
In simple language: Out;

309
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:36,201
Idiot;

310
00:24:38,172 --> 00:24:40,560
So, we were discussing
the machine...

311
00:24:42,092 --> 00:24:43,001
Why're you back?

312
00:24:44,092 --> 00:24:45,126
I forgot something

313
00:24:45,731 --> 00:24:46,561
What?

314
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,882
Instruments that record,
analyze, summarize, organize

315
00:24:49,971 --> 00:24:52,201
debate and explain information;
that are illustrated, non-illustrated

316
00:24:52,332 --> 00:24:54,163
hard-bound, paperback,
jacketed, non-jacketed

317
00:24:54,332 --> 00:24:56,209
with foreword, introduction,
table-of-contents, index

318
00:24:56,291 --> 00:24:58,044
that are intended for the
enlightenment, understanding

319
00:24:58,211 --> 00:24:59,804
enrichment, enhancement and
education of the human brain

320
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:01,968
through the sensory route of
vision, sometimes touch

321
00:25:07,571 --> 00:25:09,449
What do you mean?

322
00:25:09,692 --> 00:25:10,920
Books, sir

323
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:13,767
I forgot my books. May I?

324
00:25:14,132 --> 00:25:15,723
Couldn't you ask simply?

325
00:25:16,132 --> 00:25:19,203
I tried earlier, sir.
It simply didn't work

326
00:25:24,531 --> 00:25:27,968
Professors kept Rancho
mostly out... seldom in

327
00:25:28,372 --> 00:25:31,090
When thrown out of one class,
he'd slip into another

328
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:35,365
He said: First year or fourth year,
it's knowledge. Just grab it

329
00:25:35,811 --> 00:25:37,086
He was unlike any of us

330
00:25:37,892 --> 00:25:39,609
We fought for a shower
every morning

331
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:42,322
He'd bathe
wherever he found water

332
00:25:42,491 --> 00:25:43,322
Morning, sir

333
00:25:45,491 --> 00:25:46,891
Machines were his passion

334
00:25:47,132 --> 00:25:51,250
When he spotted them,
he opened them

335
00:25:51,572 --> 00:25:52,527
Some he could re-assemble...

336
00:25:53,572 --> 00:25:54,846
some he couldn 't

337
00:25:55,692 --> 00:25:58,080
There was another, just like him

338
00:26:00,771 --> 00:26:01,965
Joy Lobo

339
00:26:02,731 --> 00:26:04,324
Sir. Excuse me, sir

340
00:26:05,172 --> 00:26:06,320
Mr. Joy Lobo;

341
00:26:07,211 --> 00:26:09,520
Sir, if I could know the
convocation dates...

342
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:10,448
Why?

343
00:26:10,531 --> 00:26:12,284
Dad wants to make
train reservations

344
00:26:12,652 --> 00:26:16,008
I'm the first engineer from my
village. Everyone wants to attend

345
00:26:16,852 --> 00:26:18,968
In that case, call your dad

346
00:26:19,652 --> 00:26:21,449
Please hurry up.
Don't waste my time

347
00:26:27,771 --> 00:26:28,602
Hello

348
00:26:28,731 --> 00:26:31,644
Dad, the Director wants to
speak to you

349
00:26:31,811 --> 00:26:32,767
Joy;

350
00:26:32,971 --> 00:26:35,280
Mr. Lobo, your son won't
graduate this year

351
00:26:36,771 --> 00:26:37,682
What happened, sir?

352
00:26:37,771 --> 00:26:39,842
He has violated all deadlines

353
00:26:40,051 --> 00:26:43,760
Mr. Lobo, it's an unrealistic project

354
00:26:44,172 --> 00:26:45,730
He is making some
nonsense helicopter

355
00:26:46,011 --> 00:26:50,449
I suggest you don't book
your tickets. I'm so sorry

356
00:26:52,572 --> 00:26:54,881
Sir, I am this close, sir
- Is your project ready?

357
00:26:55,412 --> 00:26:59,086
Is your project ready?
- Sir, see it once, please

358
00:26:59,211 --> 00:27:00,769
Submit it, and we'll consider

359
00:27:00,932 --> 00:27:03,162
Sir, a small extension...
- Why, why should I?

360
00:27:03,251 --> 00:27:06,243
After dad's stroke,
I couldn't focus for two months

361
00:27:06,372 --> 00:27:07,566
Did you stop eating?

362
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:09,040
No

363
00:27:09,251 --> 00:27:10,127
Stopped bathing?

364
00:27:11,251 --> 00:27:12,082
So why stop studying?

365
00:27:12,211 --> 00:27:14,806
Sir, I'm very close.
See it once, please...

366
00:27:14,932 --> 00:27:16,047
Mr. Lobo;

367
00:27:16,372 --> 00:27:19,125
Sunday afternoon, my son
fell off a train and died

368
00:27:19,332 --> 00:27:24,166
Monday morning, I taught a class.
So don't give me that nonsense

369
00:27:26,491 --> 00:27:29,131
I can give you sympathy,
not an extension

370
00:27:30,132 --> 00:27:31,690
Sir... I'm very close...

371
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:02,489
Lifelong I lived

372
00:28:02,692 --> 00:28:04,807
The life of another

373
00:28:05,011 --> 00:28:07,207
For just one moment

374
00:28:07,612 --> 00:28:09,842
Let me live as I...

375
00:28:10,051 --> 00:28:11,929
Lifelong I lived

376
00:28:12,251 --> 00:28:14,321
The life of another

377
00:28:14,571 --> 00:28:16,528
For just one moment

378
00:28:16,892 --> 00:28:19,247
Let me live as I...

379
00:28:28,971 --> 00:28:33,328
Give me some sunshine
Give me some rain

380
00:28:33,692 --> 00:28:38,322
Give me another chance
I wanna grow up once again

381
00:28:38,412 --> 00:28:42,769
Give me some sunshine
Give me some rain

382
00:28:43,092 --> 00:28:48,609
Give me another chance
I wanna grow up once again

383
00:28:49,612 --> 00:28:50,964
Dude's come up with an
amazing design

384
00:28:51,332 --> 00:28:52,730
A wireless camera atop a helicopter

385
00:28:55,051 --> 00:28:57,042
Can be used for
traffic updates, security... Wow!

386
00:28:57,412 --> 00:29:00,210
But Virus said it's an
impractical design, it won't fly

387
00:29:00,612 --> 00:29:02,409
It will fly; We'll make it fly

388
00:29:04,612 --> 00:29:06,728
Don't tell Joy. It'll be a surprise

389
00:29:07,211 --> 00:29:09,645
We'll fly it up to his window
and capture his reaction

390
00:29:10,211 --> 00:29:12,248
If we work on his project,
who'll work on ours?

391
00:29:12,731 --> 00:29:15,690
Tests, vivas, quizzes -
42 exams per semester

392
00:29:16,332 --> 00:29:17,446
You scare easily, bro

393
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:22,840
Take your hand, put it over your
heart, and say, 'Aal izz well'

394
00:29:23,051 --> 00:29:25,122
All is well?
- Aal izz well

395
00:29:25,412 --> 00:29:27,686
Words of wisdom from
His Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas

396
00:29:28,172 --> 00:29:30,208
We had an old watchman
in our village

397
00:29:30,932 --> 00:29:36,051
On night patrol, he'd call out,
'Aal izz well'

398
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:40,001
And we slept peacefully.
Then there was a theft

399
00:29:40,172 --> 00:29:42,163
and we learned that
he couldn't see at night;

400
00:29:42,451 --> 00:29:45,761
He'd just yell 'Aal izz well',
and we felt secure

401
00:29:47,572 --> 00:29:51,962
That day I understood
this heart scares easily

402
00:29:52,771 --> 00:29:54,682
You have to trick it

403
00:29:55,852 --> 00:30:01,369
However big the problem,
tell your heart, 'All is well, pal'

404
00:30:02,571 --> 00:30:04,210
That resolves the problem?

405
00:30:04,451 --> 00:30:06,170
No. But you gain courage to face it

406
00:30:08,491 --> 00:30:11,801
Learn it up, bro.
We're gonna really need it here

407
00:30:28,852 --> 00:30:33,049
When life spins out of control
Just let your lips roll

408
00:30:36,771 --> 00:30:40,651
Let your lips roll
And whistle away the toll

409
00:30:43,932 --> 00:30:48,130
When life spins out of control
Just let your lips roll

410
00:30:48,332 --> 00:30:51,926
Just let your lips roll
And whistle away the toll

411
00:30:52,132 --> 00:30:55,840
Yell: All is Well...

412
00:30:55,932 --> 00:30:59,003
The chicken's clueless
about the egg's fate

413
00:30:59,572 --> 00:31:02,847
Will it hatch or
become an omelette

414
00:31:03,652 --> 00:31:06,689
No one knows
what the future holds

415
00:31:07,531 --> 00:31:09,203
So let your lips roll
And whistle away the toll

416
00:31:09,291 --> 00:31:13,523
Whistle away the toll
Yell: All is Well

417
00:31:14,412 --> 00:31:17,449
Hey bro: All is Well

418
00:31:18,172 --> 00:31:21,642
Hey mate: All is Well

419
00:31:22,132 --> 00:31:25,488
Hey bro: All is Well

420
00:31:34,372 --> 00:31:37,967
Confusion and more confusion
No sign of any solution

421
00:31:38,172 --> 00:31:41,960
Ah... finally a solution
But wait... what was the question?

422
00:31:42,092 --> 00:31:45,003
If the timid heart with fear
is about to die

423
00:31:45,692 --> 00:31:48,923
Then con it bro,
with this simple lie

424
00:31:49,451 --> 00:31:52,682
Heart's an idiot,
it will fall under that spell

425
00:31:53,491 --> 00:31:55,288
Let your lips roll
And whistle away the toll

426
00:31:55,491 --> 00:31:59,451
Whistle away the toll
Yell: All is Well

427
00:32:00,612 --> 00:32:03,683
Hey bro: All is Well

428
00:32:04,372 --> 00:32:07,409
Hey mate: All is Well

429
00:32:08,211 --> 00:32:11,170
Hey bro: All is Well

430
00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:24,080
Blew the scholarship on booze
But that did not dispel my blues

431
00:32:24,251 --> 00:32:27,881
Holy incense lit up my plight
And yet God's nowhere in sight

432
00:32:27,971 --> 00:32:31,088
The lamb is clueless for
what it's destined

433
00:32:31,852 --> 00:32:34,969
Will it be served on skewers
or simply minced

434
00:32:35,612 --> 00:32:38,843
No one knows
what the future holds

435
00:32:39,372 --> 00:32:41,282
So let your lips roll
And whistle away the toll

436
00:32:41,491 --> 00:32:45,690
Whistle away the toll
Yell: All is Well

437
00:32:46,612 --> 00:32:49,410
Hey bro: All is Well

438
00:32:50,412 --> 00:32:53,085
Hey mate: All is Well

439
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:57,204
Hey bro: All is Well

440
00:32:58,612 --> 00:33:02,445
When life spins out of control
Just let your lips roll

441
00:33:04,612 --> 00:33:08,490
Just let your lips roll
And whistle away the toll

442
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:12,048
All is Well

443
00:33:12,251 --> 00:33:15,085
The chicken's clueless
about the egg's fate

444
00:33:16,011 --> 00:33:19,128
Will it hatch or
become an omelette

445
00:33:19,932 --> 00:33:22,765
No one knows
what the future holds

446
00:33:23,892 --> 00:33:25,529
So let your lips roll
And whistle away the toll

447
00:33:25,612 --> 00:33:27,090
Whistle away the toll

448
00:33:27,811 --> 00:33:29,211
Eureka! Eureka;

449
00:33:30,971 --> 00:33:33,724
Yell: All is Well

450
00:33:34,652 --> 00:33:37,689
Hey Mrs. Chicken: All is Well

451
00:33:38,491 --> 00:33:41,369
Hey Mr. Lamb: All is Well

452
00:33:42,332 --> 00:33:45,243
Hey bro: All is Well

453
00:33:45,372 --> 00:33:47,407
Hey, take it up to Joy's window

454
00:33:48,051 --> 00:33:49,086
Take it higher

455
00:33:49,892 --> 00:33:51,483
Look at Silencer: the nude dude;

456
00:33:54,811 --> 00:33:56,290
Joy, come out

457
00:33:58,172 --> 00:33:59,730
Come to the window

458
00:33:59,932 --> 00:34:01,250
Joy, look outside

459
00:34:53,411 --> 00:34:54,242
Good news, sir

460
00:34:55,572 --> 00:34:58,449
The police and Joy's father
have no clue

461
00:34:59,692 --> 00:35:00,965
Everyone thinks this is suicide

462
00:35:03,132 --> 00:35:04,246
The post mortem report -

463
00:35:04,532 --> 00:35:06,762
Cause of Death: Intense
pressure on windpipe

464
00:35:06,972 --> 00:35:07,927
resulting in choking

465
00:35:10,572 --> 00:35:14,360
All think the pressure
on the jugular killed him

466
00:35:16,012 --> 00:35:18,844
What about the mental pressure
for the last four years?

467
00:35:19,771 --> 00:35:20,648
That's missing in the report

468
00:35:23,452 --> 00:35:25,090
Engineers are a clever bunch

469
00:35:26,492 --> 00:35:29,688
They haven't made a machine
to measure mental pressure

470
00:35:32,052 --> 00:35:33,326
If they had, all would know...

471
00:35:34,492 --> 00:35:35,844
this isn't suicide... it's murder

472
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:43,641
How dare you blame me
for Joy's suicide?

473
00:35:44,492 --> 00:35:47,210
If one student can't handle
pressure, is it our fault?

474
00:35:47,652 --> 00:35:51,121
Life is full of pressures.
Will you always blame others?

475
00:35:51,532 --> 00:35:55,206
I don't blame you, sir.
I blame the system

476
00:35:56,612 --> 00:36:00,605
Look at these statistics -
India ranks N0.1 in suicides

477
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:04,523
Every 90 minutes,
a student attempts suicide

478
00:36:06,132 --> 00:36:08,929
Suicide is a bigger killer
than disease

479
00:36:09,132 --> 00:36:10,405
Something's terribly wrong, sir

480
00:36:10,652 --> 00:36:12,688
I can't speak for the rest

481
00:36:13,331 --> 00:36:15,208
but this is one of the
finest colleges in the country

482
00:36:15,931 --> 00:36:17,762
I've run this place for 32 years

483
00:36:18,291 --> 00:36:21,409
We were ranked 28th.
Now we're N0.1

484
00:36:21,572 --> 00:36:23,085
What's the point, sir?

485
00:36:24,612 --> 00:36:27,887
Here they don't discuss
new ideas or inventions

486
00:36:29,612 --> 00:36:34,322
They discuss grades,
jobs, settling in the USA

487
00:36:35,572 --> 00:36:40,282
They teach how to get good scores.
They don't teach Engineering

488
00:36:40,452 --> 00:36:42,568
Now you will teach me
how to teach?

489
00:36:43,012 --> 00:36:43,887
No sir, I...

490
00:36:47,012 --> 00:36:48,047
Sir, my paper...

491
00:37:06,172 --> 00:37:07,240
Vaidyanathan, please sit down

492
00:37:08,931 --> 00:37:10,762
Here is a
self-proclaimed professor

493
00:37:11,211 --> 00:37:15,728
who thinks he is better than
our highly qualified teachers

494
00:37:16,411 --> 00:37:20,690
Professor Ranchhoddas Chanchad
will teach us Engineering

495
00:37:37,891 --> 00:37:40,121
We do not have all day

496
00:38:15,612 --> 00:38:19,684
You have 30 seconds
to define these terms

497
00:38:20,092 --> 00:38:22,047
You may refer to your books

498
00:38:22,612 --> 00:38:24,568
Raise your hand
if you get the answer

499
00:38:25,811 --> 00:38:29,043
Let's see who comes first,
who comes last

500
00:38:29,851 --> 00:38:32,969
Your time starts... now

501
00:39:01,411 --> 00:39:02,288
Time up

502
00:39:04,731 --> 00:39:05,686
Time up, sir

503
00:39:07,492 --> 00:39:09,766
No one got the answer?

504
00:39:12,172 --> 00:39:15,402
Now rewind your life by a minute

505
00:39:16,572 --> 00:39:19,291
When I asked this question,
were you excited? Curious?

506
00:39:19,452 --> 00:39:22,090
Thrilled that you'd learn
something new?

507
00:39:22,851 --> 00:39:25,161
Anyone? ... Sir?

508
00:39:27,972 --> 00:39:30,690
No. You all got into a frantic race

509
00:39:32,652 --> 00:39:34,688
What's the use of such methods,
even if you come first

510
00:39:36,851 --> 00:39:40,083
Will your knowledge increase?
No, just the pressure

511
00:39:40,972 --> 00:39:42,451
This is a college,
not a pressure cooker

512
00:39:44,572 --> 00:39:47,961
Even a circus lion learns to sit
on a chair in fear of the whip

513
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:52,367
But you call such a lion
'well trained', not 'well educated'

514
00:39:52,452 --> 00:39:53,362
Hello!

515
00:39:53,851 --> 00:39:58,242
This is not a philosophy class.
Just explain those two words

516
00:39:58,612 --> 00:40:00,250
Sir, these words don't exist

517
00:40:01,371 --> 00:40:04,568
These are my friends' names.
Farhan and Raju

518
00:40:16,612 --> 00:40:17,487
Quiet;

519
00:40:18,931 --> 00:40:21,650
Nonsense! Is this how
you'll teach Engineering?

520
00:40:22,092 --> 00:40:23,922
Sir, I wasn't teaching
you Engineering

521
00:40:24,492 --> 00:40:25,925
You're an expert at that

522
00:40:26,731 --> 00:40:29,849
I was teaching you... how to teach

523
00:40:32,572 --> 00:40:34,402
And I'm sure one day you'll learn

524
00:40:35,371 --> 00:40:38,250
because unlike you, I never
abandon my weak students

525
00:40:38,731 --> 00:40:39,686
Bye, sir

526
00:40:41,692 --> 00:40:42,726
Quiet;

527
00:40:45,172 --> 00:40:46,240
Quiet, I said

528
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:52,802
I regret to inform you
that your son...

529
00:40:52,931 --> 00:40:54,001
Farhan...
Raju...

530
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:55,286
has fallen into bad company

531
00:40:55,612 --> 00:40:58,648
Without urgent corrective steps,
his future will be ruined

532
00:40:59,692 --> 00:41:02,842
Virus 's letters dropped on
our homes like atom bombs

533
00:41:03,132 --> 00:41:05,487
Hiroshima and Nagasaki
plunged into gloom

534
00:41:05,572 --> 00:41:08,530
Our parents invited us -
for a dressing down

535
00:41:09,532 --> 00:41:11,601
Come in

536
00:41:14,052 --> 00:41:14,961
See that?

537
00:41:16,291 --> 00:41:18,760
We could afford
just one air-conditioner

538
00:41:20,452 --> 00:41:23,967
We put it in Farhan's room,
so he could study in comfort

539
00:41:25,371 --> 00:41:29,159
I didn't buy a car.
I manage with a scooter

540
00:41:30,012 --> 00:41:31,809
We put all our money
into Farhan's education

541
00:41:33,251 --> 00:41:37,210
We sacrificed our comforts
for Farhan's future. U nderstand?

542
00:41:45,492 --> 00:41:46,811
You took these pictures, Farhan?

543
00:41:48,652 --> 00:41:50,563
He had that useless
obsession for a while

544
00:41:51,492 --> 00:41:53,083
Went around taking
pictures of animals

545
00:41:53,172 --> 00:41:55,844
Wanted to be a
wildlife photographer

546
00:41:57,012 --> 00:41:59,320
Son, what was your
score that year?

547
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:01,400
91%

548
00:42:01,731 --> 00:42:06,202
Hear that? Straight drop
from 94% to 91%

549
00:42:09,211 --> 00:42:10,610
You find it funny?

550
00:42:11,251 --> 00:42:15,164
No sir, sorry. I'm just
amazed at the photos

551
00:42:15,331 --> 00:42:17,846
Why make him an engineer...
Why not a wildlife photographer?

552
00:42:18,012 --> 00:42:19,126
Enough;

553
00:42:20,331 --> 00:42:25,405
I humbly request you -
Don't ruin my son's future

554
00:42:26,851 --> 00:42:29,126
Food's on the table, boys. C'mon

555
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:36,047
If you ever visit again,
do eat with us

556
00:42:38,851 --> 00:42:40,251
Dad denied us a meal...

557
00:42:40,811 --> 00:42:42,403
So, to fill our bellies with food...

558
00:42:42,771 --> 00:42:45,922
and ears with more reprimands,
we reached Raju's house

559
00:42:47,811 --> 00:42:51,724
Raju's house was straight
out of a 50's black and white film

560
00:42:52,452 --> 00:42:53,407
A small, dingy room...

561
00:42:53,572 --> 00:42:55,005
a paralyzed father...

562
00:42:55,771 --> 00:42:56,920
a coughing mother...

563
00:42:57,291 --> 00:42:58,724
and an unwed sister

564
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:01,130
A sofa sprouting springs...

565
00:43:01,572 --> 00:43:03,766
a 24 hour water supply -
from the leaking roof

566
00:43:04,411 --> 00:43:07,882
Mother was a retired school
teacher and a tireless complainer

567
00:43:08,532 --> 00:43:10,601
Father was once a postmaster

568
00:43:11,092 --> 00:43:13,400
Paralysis shut down
his body partly...

569
00:43:13,851 --> 00:43:16,161
his salary completely.
And the sister...

570
00:43:16,331 --> 00:43:19,802
Kammo's turned 28.
They demand a car in dowry

571
00:43:20,411 --> 00:43:22,925
If you don't study and earn,
how will she marry?

572
00:43:23,411 --> 00:43:24,288
Some okra?

573
00:43:25,251 --> 00:43:28,960
Okra is now 12 /- per kilo,
cauliflower is 10/-

574
00:43:29,291 --> 00:43:30,644
It's daylight robbery;

575
00:43:31,012 --> 00:43:34,846
What will we eat if we get
warnings from your college?

576
00:43:35,092 --> 00:43:35,967
Mom!

577
00:43:37,492 --> 00:43:38,402
Cottage cheese?

578
00:43:38,851 --> 00:43:42,242
Cottage cheese should be sold
at the jewelers, in velvet pouches

579
00:43:42,532 --> 00:43:44,250
Cottage cheese?
- No, no, it's ok

580
00:43:44,891 --> 00:43:46,371
Mom, please

581
00:43:47,211 --> 00:43:48,929
Alright, I'll shut up

582
00:43:50,532 --> 00:43:54,844
Earn for the family,
slave like a maid

583
00:43:55,052 --> 00:43:57,246
and then take the vow of silence

584
00:43:58,172 --> 00:44:02,528
If not with my son, with whom
do I share my woes: his friends?

585
00:44:06,291 --> 00:44:07,327
Hey Raju

586
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:11,721
We were in a huge dilemma

587
00:44:12,331 --> 00:44:15,324
Do we comfort our friend
or console his mom?

588
00:44:16,492 --> 00:44:19,324
Screw it, we thought, let's
focus on the cottage cheese

589
00:44:30,771 --> 00:44:33,490
Even his eczema cream
costs 55 /- now

590
00:44:38,052 --> 00:44:39,326
Another roti?

591
00:44:39,652 --> 00:44:42,485
No, thank you. We're through

592
00:44:49,972 --> 00:44:52,440
Okra for 12 /-
- Cauliflower for 10 /-

593
00:44:55,371 --> 00:44:57,123
At least you were offered a meal

594
00:44:57,931 --> 00:45:00,684
Unlike your sadistic dad...
'Hitler' Qureshi;

595
00:45:00,811 --> 00:45:03,405
And your mom is Mother Teresa...
Feeding us 'eczema roti'!

596
00:45:03,652 --> 00:45:07,088
Don't poke fun at my mom;
- Enough, you guys

597
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,724
I'm famished. Let's eat out

598
00:45:08,851 --> 00:45:11,126
It's month end. Who'll pay?
His Mother Teresa?

599
00:45:12,132 --> 00:45:16,523
To eat out, you don't need money.
Just a uniform. Look...

600
00:45:19,211 --> 00:45:20,804
C'mon
- Come

601
00:45:22,331 --> 00:45:24,481
Good evening,
good evening

602
00:45:24,572 --> 00:45:25,402
Oh, U ncle

603
00:45:30,492 --> 00:45:33,608
Three large vodkas.
- Half soda, half water

604
00:45:33,811 --> 00:45:35,005
If we're caught, we're dead

605
00:45:35,172 --> 00:45:37,606
What's for starters?
- Get double portions

606
00:45:37,692 --> 00:45:40,603
Leave this here and start
some peppy music

607
00:45:41,331 --> 00:45:42,923
Pia, what the hell!

608
00:45:43,291 --> 00:45:45,885
Why're you wearing
this ancient piece of junk?

609
00:45:47,052 --> 00:45:50,487
What'll people say: My fiancee...

610
00:45:50,891 --> 00:45:53,360
a doctor in the making,
wearing a cheap, 200 /- watch;

611
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:55,684
Please take it off. Thank you

612
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:57,201
Hi handsome

613
00:45:57,331 --> 00:46:00,050
Hey Aunty.
You're looking good

614
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:02,599
Don't miss my set, darling
- Rubies?

615
00:46:02,771 --> 00:46:05,286
From Mandalay
- Mandalay... Wow;

616
00:46:05,371 --> 00:46:07,965
Hey, let's go meet David
- Of course

617
00:46:11,012 --> 00:46:12,047
Excuse me

618
00:46:14,132 --> 00:46:15,246
Yes?

619
00:46:15,532 --> 00:46:16,567
Flowers

620
00:46:18,012 --> 00:46:21,083
May I take the glass?
- Why?

621
00:46:21,371 --> 00:46:23,567
So you don't break it on my head

622
00:46:24,331 --> 00:46:25,525
Why would I do that?

623
00:46:25,931 --> 00:46:27,967
For the free advice I'll now impart

624
00:46:29,092 --> 00:46:29,922
What?

625
00:46:30,251 --> 00:46:31,764
Don't marry that ass

626
00:46:32,811 --> 00:46:33,688
Excuse me?

627
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:35,530
He's not a human,
he's a price tag

628
00:46:35,931 --> 00:46:38,809
He'll turn your life into a
nightmare of brands and prices

629
00:46:39,411 --> 00:46:41,880
He'll ruin your life.
Your future will be finished

630
00:46:42,172 --> 00:46:43,001
Want a demonstration?

631
00:46:45,092 --> 00:46:46,650
Shall I find out
the price of his shoes?

632
00:46:48,132 --> 00:46:49,963
I won't ask.
He'll announce it himself

633
00:47:01,532 --> 00:47:07,242
What the hell...
Mint sauce on my $300 shoes!

634
00:47:07,371 --> 00:47:10,443
Run for your life;
It's free advice. Take it or leave it

635
00:47:10,972 --> 00:47:13,565
Genuine Italian leather -
hand-stitched;

636
00:47:17,972 --> 00:47:20,565
Dad, are they your guests?

637
00:47:23,771 --> 00:47:26,922
My students.
What're they doing here?

638
00:47:30,731 --> 00:47:31,880
Hold on, Dad

639
00:47:33,371 --> 00:47:35,521
These beans smell great

640
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:37,882
No room for roti
- Just pile it on

641
00:47:39,771 --> 00:47:41,090
Hi
- Hey

642
00:47:42,572 --> 00:47:45,449
That was an eye-opener.
Thank you so much

643
00:47:46,891 --> 00:47:49,086
It was my moral responsibility

644
00:47:49,851 --> 00:47:51,204
Can I ask you for little more help?

645
00:47:52,251 --> 00:47:54,766
Dad won't let me break off
this engagement

646
00:47:55,692 --> 00:47:59,525
You explain so well.
Can you give him a demo too?

647
00:47:59,811 --> 00:48:02,326
Certainly.
Raju, the mint sauce

648
00:48:02,851 --> 00:48:04,251
You're really sweet

649
00:48:05,411 --> 00:48:08,369
Where is your daddy?
- Right behind you

650
00:48:12,811 --> 00:48:15,041
Aal izz well

651
00:48:15,811 --> 00:48:20,760
Run for your life;
It's free advice. Take it or leave it

652
00:48:21,052 --> 00:48:22,530
What're you doing here?

653
00:48:23,132 --> 00:48:26,123
We'll hand these gifts
to the couple

654
00:48:27,132 --> 00:48:29,327
I'll do that for you.
It's my sister's wedding

655
00:48:29,731 --> 00:48:30,847
Sister?

656
00:48:33,572 --> 00:48:35,880
Sir, what's the sum total
of your daughters?

657
00:48:37,411 --> 00:48:38,242
Empty. No gift cheques

658
00:48:38,572 --> 00:48:40,563
Forgot the cheques, Raju
...Farhan?

659
00:48:40,652 --> 00:48:44,644
We didn't invite you,
you must be from the groom's side

660
00:48:45,132 --> 00:48:48,920
No sir, we're here as the
emissaries of science

661
00:48:49,052 --> 00:48:51,168
How? Can you explain?

662
00:48:51,411 --> 00:48:54,927
Dad, he explains superbly.
I'm sure he'll give us a demo

663
00:48:55,211 --> 00:48:56,121
Won't you?

664
00:48:56,931 --> 00:49:00,367
Well, Delhi has plenty of
power cuts that...

665
00:49:00,612 --> 00:49:02,842
disrupt wedding celebrations

666
00:49:03,172 --> 00:49:05,208
So I thought of making
an inverter that...

667
00:49:05,331 --> 00:49:07,641
draws power from guests' cars

668
00:49:07,851 --> 00:49:09,170
I see

669
00:49:09,371 --> 00:49:10,804
Wow

670
00:49:11,172 --> 00:49:12,525
So where's the inverter?

671
00:49:13,291 --> 00:49:14,849
Sir, the design is ready

672
00:49:17,811 --> 00:49:19,039
Where's the design, Farhan?

673
00:49:19,452 --> 00:49:22,364
I gave you the design
- I gave it to Raju

674
00:49:22,771 --> 00:49:23,681
Raju, design?

675
00:49:26,652 --> 00:49:30,246
Never mind the design.
I'll make the inverter and show you

676
00:49:30,572 --> 00:49:34,086
You can only invent stories,
not an inverter

677
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:37,329
I'll make one, I promise

678
00:49:37,652 --> 00:49:41,007
And I'll name it after you.
After all, it was invented...

679
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:44,768
at your daughter's wedding.
So it'll be an honor...

680
00:49:44,891 --> 00:49:50,682
Farhan, Raju. I'll see you
in my office tomorrow

681
00:49:56,331 --> 00:49:59,688
Sir, what was the cost per plate?
We'll reimburse you

682
00:50:00,012 --> 00:50:01,603
...in installments

683
00:50:03,972 --> 00:50:07,088
We'll never crash a wedding again
- Not even my own

684
00:50:07,211 --> 00:50:09,362
In fact, I won't even marry.
Nor will he

685
00:50:10,012 --> 00:50:11,967
Uh... right. No marriage

686
00:50:13,411 --> 00:50:15,686
Your parents shouldn't have
married either

687
00:50:17,291 --> 00:50:19,726
The world would have
to feed two less idiots

688
00:50:22,132 --> 00:50:23,121
Sit!

689
00:50:33,692 --> 00:50:34,681
Pay attention

690
00:50:45,172 --> 00:50:49,927
This is Ranchhoddas's father's
monthly income

691
00:50:51,211 --> 00:50:57,286
Couple of zeroes less,
and it's still a sizeable income

692
00:50:59,731 --> 00:51:05,806
But erase another zero,
and I would worry a little

693
00:51:07,012 --> 00:51:10,242
Isn't that your father's income,
Farhan?

694
00:51:11,092 --> 00:51:12,730
Yes, sir

695
00:51:14,052 --> 00:51:16,007
Now take away another zero...

696
00:51:18,931 --> 00:51:22,561
and that's your family income,
Raju Rastogi

697
00:51:23,692 --> 00:51:25,010
Big reason to worry

698
00:51:29,532 --> 00:51:36,403
Take my advice and shift into
Chatur Ramalingam's room

699
00:51:36,811 --> 00:51:40,885
Exams are here. Stay with
Rancho and you're sure to fail

700
00:52:01,931 --> 00:52:04,240
Want a shave?
- No, sir

701
00:52:04,411 --> 00:52:05,242
Then get lost!

702
00:52:16,052 --> 00:52:21,409
Raju, don't worry. This is Virus's
move to split us. Divide and rule

703
00:52:21,532 --> 00:52:22,567
I have to worry

704
00:52:22,972 --> 00:52:26,327
He grades us, and I need
good grades for a good job

705
00:52:27,211 --> 00:52:30,123
Unlike you, I don't have a
rich dad I can live off

706
00:52:30,251 --> 00:52:32,048
Shut up, Raju

707
00:52:32,291 --> 00:52:34,851
Must we follow all his hogwash?
'Aal izz well'

708
00:52:35,211 --> 00:52:36,610
I won't be his flunky... like you

709
00:52:37,532 --> 00:52:39,726
You're crossing the line
- No, I'm drawing one

710
00:52:40,211 --> 00:52:41,849
I have a family to support

711
00:52:43,972 --> 00:52:46,121
Dad's medicines
swallow up mom's pension

712
00:52:48,012 --> 00:52:52,210
My sis can't marry because
they want a car in dowry

713
00:52:55,012 --> 00:52:59,085
Mom hasn't bought a
single saree in five years

714
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:04,884
Now don't get your mom's
wardrobe into the debate

715
00:53:05,972 --> 00:53:07,882
By the way, how many sarees
per annum is reasonable?

716
00:53:08,931 --> 00:53:10,126
Hey... no wisecracks about mom

717
00:53:10,851 --> 00:53:14,925
We'll study with all our heart,
but not just for grades

718
00:53:15,572 --> 00:53:19,724
To quote a Wise One: Study
to be accomplished, not affluent

719
00:53:20,452 --> 00:53:25,764
Follow excellence. And success
will chase you, pants down;

720
00:53:26,931 --> 00:53:29,445
Which Wise One says this?
His Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas?

721
00:53:31,411 --> 00:53:32,367
Go rot in the bogs;

722
00:53:33,931 --> 00:53:36,809
Raju, don't stress. We'll top
our class. Nothing is impossible

723
00:53:37,092 --> 00:53:38,206
Oh yeah?

724
00:53:41,731 --> 00:53:43,768
Shove this back into the tube

725
00:53:46,692 --> 00:53:48,250
Raju got onto another train

726
00:53:48,771 --> 00:53:53,721
His travails with Chatur began.
Yes, I mean travails, not travels

727
00:53:57,972 --> 00:53:59,802
Chatur was called 'Silencer'

728
00:54:00,132 --> 00:54:03,681
To sharpen his memory,
he popped pills from a local quack

729
00:54:04,092 --> 00:54:05,969
And then let off silent...
but lethal farts

730
00:54:08,572 --> 00:54:11,643
I didn't do it... Raju?

731
00:54:11,811 --> 00:54:14,371
He always blamed others
for the output

732
00:54:15,092 --> 00:54:17,844
Silencer crammed 18 hours a day

733
00:54:18,092 --> 00:54:21,083
On exam eve,
he would distract others

734
00:54:24,891 --> 00:54:27,849
His belief: There are only
two ways of topping

735
00:54:28,172 --> 00:54:31,322
Elevate your own grades or
shrink your opponents' grades

736
00:54:35,452 --> 00:54:39,161
Rancho decided to subdue
Silencer and rescue Raju...

737
00:54:39,612 --> 00:54:40,840
with one master plan

738
00:54:42,811 --> 00:54:50,492
Our Director has unceasingly
served... 'Served' means...

739
00:54:50,572 --> 00:54:54,451
Damn the meaning,
I'll memorize it

740
00:54:55,811 --> 00:54:59,282
Chatur was the introductory speaker
at the Teachers' Day function

741
00:54:59,612 --> 00:55:03,365
To impress Virus, he got his
speech written by the librarian...

742
00:55:03,572 --> 00:55:04,846
in highbrow Hindi

743
00:55:06,331 --> 00:55:11,485
Hello. Hold on.
Chatur, call for you

744
00:55:11,851 --> 00:55:14,161
Please collect the printout.
I'll be right back

745
00:55:15,492 --> 00:55:18,643
Oh... the things I have to do...

746
00:55:22,092 --> 00:55:25,128
Mr. Dubey, the Director was
remembering you

747
00:55:25,251 --> 00:55:26,764
Really?
- Yes. Just now

748
00:55:27,132 --> 00:55:30,362
I'll see him right away.
Give this to Chatur

749
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:38,244
Hello. Hello
- Hello, Mr. Ramalingam?

750
00:55:38,371 --> 00:55:39,248
Yes?

751
00:55:39,811 --> 00:55:42,086
I'm calling from the police station

752
00:55:42,452 --> 00:55:45,170
Are you from Uganda?
- Yes sir

753
00:55:46,652 --> 00:55:49,563
Your life is in danger
- What? ... How?

754
00:55:50,652 --> 00:55:52,369
Listen carefully, or else...

755
00:55:52,972 --> 00:55:57,123
you'll get killed as you step out
of the college gate

756
00:55:57,851 --> 00:55:59,045
Why? What happened?

757
00:55:59,172 --> 00:56:00,684
While Chatur was kept engaged

758
00:56:01,092 --> 00:56:04,925
Rancho altered a few words
in his speech, for eg...

759
00:56:05,132 --> 00:56:07,407
'served' became 'screwed'

760
00:56:08,211 --> 00:56:09,440
Yes sir?

761
00:56:09,972 --> 00:56:12,405
Who are you?
- Dubey. Librarian

762
00:56:14,891 --> 00:56:16,007
I'm permanent staff, sir

763
00:56:16,612 --> 00:56:17,965
Congratulations

764
00:56:18,371 --> 00:56:21,603
Hold on a moment.
The chief is on the other line

765
00:56:21,972 --> 00:56:22,882
Excuse me, sir

766
00:56:32,172 --> 00:56:34,322
Yes... so where was I?

767
00:56:34,572 --> 00:56:36,880
You said I may die...
outside the gate

768
00:56:37,012 --> 00:56:43,166
Right. As you get out of the gate,
you'll see a traffic signal

769
00:56:43,371 --> 00:56:45,327
Traffic signal. Ok

770
00:56:45,532 --> 00:56:50,844
When it turns red,
all the cars will halt

771
00:56:51,331 --> 00:56:52,606
Ok. Then?

772
00:56:52,731 --> 00:56:54,643
Then cross the road
with great caution

773
00:56:55,371 --> 00:57:00,400
Because son, in rush hour
if a car hits you, you're dead

774
00:57:02,251 --> 00:57:04,003
What nonsense! I know that

775
00:57:04,132 --> 00:57:07,568
You know that? Excellent.
Then you're safe my boy

776
00:57:14,331 --> 00:57:16,322
From the librarian, Silencer

777
00:57:16,452 --> 00:57:17,965
You don't call me that,
Chanchad

778
00:57:23,572 --> 00:57:25,563
Hey. The Director said
he didn't call for me

779
00:57:26,331 --> 00:57:28,481
Who said 'called'?
I just said he 'remembered' you

780
00:57:28,652 --> 00:57:31,119
Remembered?
Rascals;

781
00:57:38,851 --> 00:57:40,922
Distinguished Mr. Chairperson

782
00:57:43,132 --> 00:57:47,250
Chief guest, the Honorable
Minister of Education

783
00:57:47,851 --> 00:57:51,639
respected teachers and friends

784
00:57:53,172 --> 00:57:57,847
ICE has now soared
beyond the stratosphere

785
00:57:58,452 --> 00:58:02,570
The credit goes solely to

786
00:58:02,972 --> 00:58:06,601
Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe.
Give him a big hand

787
00:58:06,731 --> 00:58:10,610
Sir, the voice is his
but the words are mine

788
00:58:11,331 --> 00:58:13,481
He's a great guy, really you are

789
00:58:15,172 --> 00:58:22,760
For 32 years, he has
unceasingly screwed students

790
00:58:25,211 --> 00:58:27,487
He means: 'served' students

791
00:58:27,731 --> 00:58:30,199
I'm sure his endeavors
will continue

792
00:58:32,771 --> 00:58:37,606
We are astounded at
how one man, in one lifetime

793
00:58:37,811 --> 00:58:40,610
can screw so many, so well

794
00:58:43,572 --> 00:58:48,646
With rigorous training
he's built up his stamina

795
00:58:52,211 --> 00:58:58,559
He's spent every living minute
just screwing

796
00:59:01,052 --> 00:59:02,724
Let's replicate his methods

797
00:59:06,371 --> 00:59:11,809
Tomorrow ICE students
will go across the globe

798
00:59:12,452 --> 00:59:18,402
Wherever we go,
we promise to screw

799
00:59:22,291 --> 00:59:25,364
We'll hoist this screwer's flag
all over the world

800
00:59:30,731 --> 00:59:35,327
We'll show the world that
our capacity to screw...

801
00:59:35,652 --> 00:59:37,563
cannot be matched by any student...

802
00:59:37,811 --> 00:59:41,202
anywhere on the planet

803
00:59:48,612 --> 00:59:51,523
Mr. Minister. Good evening

804
00:59:52,092 --> 00:59:59,282
You have given this institution
what it sorely needs

805
01:00:00,012 --> 01:00:01,570
Booty, funds
- Bosom

806
01:00:05,012 --> 01:00:07,081
It's booty, stupid. Bosom means...

807
01:00:08,452 --> 01:00:10,407
What nonsense! That's insulting

808
01:00:10,851 --> 01:00:15,367
Everyone has a bosom,
but it remains pocketed

809
01:00:16,891 --> 01:00:18,802
No one offers it so readily

810
01:00:22,652 --> 01:00:23,561
Vulgar fellow;

811
01:00:23,731 --> 01:00:25,289
You have generously offered
your bosom...

812
01:00:25,652 --> 01:00:28,610
to this relentless screwer

813
01:00:31,452 --> 01:00:35,525
Now see how he makes it grow

814
01:00:35,771 --> 01:00:39,844
Is this what you teach here, Director?

815
01:00:47,211 --> 01:00:50,487
On this august occasion,
here's a Sanskrit verse...

816
01:00:50,612 --> 01:00:53,489
Listen to this: the might
of his fart in verse

817
01:00:54,012 --> 01:00:56,445
A good loud fart is honorable

818
01:00:56,652 --> 01:00:58,927
'Fart'? Go, Silencer

819
01:00:59,092 --> 01:01:01,844
A medium fart is tolerable

820
01:01:05,012 --> 01:01:08,447
Softer windbreaks are terrible

821
01:01:11,291 --> 01:01:16,001
And the silent ones unbearable

822
01:01:20,132 --> 01:01:21,644
What did I do?

823
01:01:25,731 --> 01:01:28,565
That's what mindless cramming
does to you

824
01:01:28,731 --> 01:01:32,088
Cramming may see you
through four years of college

825
01:01:32,331 --> 01:01:36,007
but it will 'screw' you
for the next 40 years

826
01:01:37,172 --> 01:01:39,686
He still doesn't get it

827
01:01:45,572 --> 01:01:49,769
'Medium fart is tolerable'...
Unbelievable;

828
01:01:50,012 --> 01:01:52,572
You're a poet, Rancho.
How did you think of this?

829
01:01:53,931 --> 01:01:57,208
That was fun.
He didn't know what hit him

830
01:01:59,612 --> 01:02:02,809
You swines!
What did I ever do to you?

831
01:02:05,652 --> 01:02:07,608
Sorry man.
Don't take it personally

832
01:02:07,851 --> 01:02:09,045
I will

833
01:02:09,612 --> 01:02:12,364
Chatur Ramalingam
will never forget this insult

834
01:02:12,972 --> 01:02:16,681
I'll think of it every minute,
every second of my life

835
01:02:16,972 --> 01:02:22,126
Sorry man. That was a demo
for Raju: Don't cram blindly

836
01:02:22,452 --> 01:02:24,568
Understand and enjoy
the wonders of Science

837
01:02:24,692 --> 01:02:27,081
I'm not here to enjoy Science

838
01:02:27,211 --> 01:02:30,010
So You're here to screw Science

839
01:02:31,612 --> 01:02:34,489
Go ahead.
Laugh at my methods

840
01:02:35,532 --> 01:02:39,684
But one day these methods
will bring me success

841
01:02:40,132 --> 01:02:42,885
That day I'll laugh and you'll cry

842
01:02:44,251 --> 01:02:48,324
You're on the wrong track again.
Don't chase success

843
01:02:49,172 --> 01:02:51,288
Become a good engineer
and success will chase you

844
01:02:51,492 --> 01:02:55,929
These ideals don't work
in the real world

845
01:02:56,731 --> 01:03:00,565
You take your train, I'll take mine

846
01:03:01,331 --> 01:03:04,483
Ten years from now
we'll meet at the same station

847
01:03:05,331 --> 01:03:10,086
Same day. Same place.
We'll see who's more successful

848
01:03:10,371 --> 01:03:12,681
you... or I

849
01:03:13,411 --> 01:03:17,563
Have the balls? C'mon, bet;

850
01:03:17,771 --> 01:03:21,208
It's a challenge

851
01:03:22,452 --> 01:03:23,327
Watch it!

852
01:03:29,692 --> 01:03:30,568
What's he writing?

853
01:03:37,891 --> 01:03:40,086
Don't forget this date

854
01:03:48,052 --> 01:03:50,519
I'm not used to
such expensive gifts, Suhas

855
01:03:50,851 --> 01:03:52,045
Get used to them, Pia

856
01:03:52,172 --> 01:03:54,208
You're gonna be
Suhas Tandon's wife

857
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:55,400
Where's the bill, man?

858
01:03:59,692 --> 01:04:00,568
I'll be back

859
01:04:10,532 --> 01:04:12,123
You changed the speech?
- What?

860
01:04:12,211 --> 01:04:13,041
Don't lie

861
01:04:13,731 --> 01:04:15,528
Um... Yeah

862
01:04:15,731 --> 01:04:18,041
What's your problem with dad?
- I have no problem

863
01:04:18,492 --> 01:04:21,210
I'm making an inverter
named after him. Look... Oh

864
01:04:25,371 --> 01:04:26,804
Why're you harassing him?

865
01:04:27,652 --> 01:04:29,005
'Cause he runs a factory,
not a college

866
01:04:29,251 --> 01:04:32,800
Churning out asses.
Like that one

867
01:04:37,731 --> 01:04:38,721
She destroyed it, man

868
01:04:41,972 --> 01:04:43,166
How dare you call him an ass?

869
01:04:43,371 --> 01:04:46,523
He is one!
First Engineering, then MBA

870
01:04:46,652 --> 01:04:48,369
then becomes a banker in the USA

871
01:04:49,251 --> 01:04:51,641
Because it rakes in
more money?

872
01:04:51,891 --> 01:04:54,326
Life for him is just
a profit-loss statement

873
01:04:54,572 --> 01:04:56,483
He sees profit in you,
so he's with you

874
01:04:56,811 --> 01:05:00,327
Director's daughter, doctor in the
making... Good for his image!

875
01:05:00,612 --> 01:05:01,840
It's not you he cares for

876
01:05:04,012 --> 01:05:05,331
Who do you think you are?

877
01:05:05,572 --> 01:05:07,164
What do you mean
he doesn't care for me?

878
01:05:09,012 --> 01:05:10,922
New watch? One moment

879
01:05:12,092 --> 01:05:14,083
You always need a demo

880
01:05:15,092 --> 01:05:15,887
Hey Suhas

881
01:05:17,972 --> 01:05:19,485
Where were you?

882
01:05:19,891 --> 01:05:21,483
She's looking for her watch

883
01:05:21,652 --> 01:05:23,369
What? You lost the watch

884
01:05:23,612 --> 01:05:24,726
Never mind. Get another

885
01:05:25,012 --> 01:05:26,239
It cost 400,000;

886
01:05:28,211 --> 01:05:30,088
Mine's just 250/-
but keeps the same time

887
01:05:30,251 --> 01:05:32,481
How could you be so careless, Pia

888
01:05:32,652 --> 01:05:35,643
This callous attitude is
disgusting. It's disrespectful

889
01:05:35,771 --> 01:05:38,239
That was a limited edition watch

890
01:05:38,612 --> 01:05:41,922
Now wear your ancient
piece of junk at dinner

891
01:05:43,211 --> 01:05:44,565
What're you staring at?

892
01:05:47,411 --> 01:05:50,050
Here come the tears!
Real mature, Pia

893
01:05:50,572 --> 01:05:51,766
I can't handle this

894
01:05:52,572 --> 01:05:54,608
Stop crying and look for it

895
01:06:07,572 --> 01:06:10,369
Find another wrist
for this watch... Ass;

896
01:06:16,532 --> 01:06:19,092
Hey, you're awesome.
Called him an ass to his face

897
01:06:19,331 --> 01:06:20,161
Get lost

898
01:06:20,931 --> 01:06:22,047
It's too noisy here

899
01:06:22,371 --> 01:06:24,202
She's saying 'Thank you',
I hear 'Get lost'

900
01:06:24,371 --> 01:06:27,090
I said 'Get lost'
- Don't get so uptight

901
01:06:27,452 --> 01:06:30,090
Actually, you never
really loved him

902
01:06:30,492 --> 01:06:31,322
What do you mean?

903
01:06:31,692 --> 01:06:36,288
When you see him, do the
winds whisper a melody?

904
01:06:37,771 --> 01:06:39,329
Your scarf flies in slow motion?

905
01:06:40,291 --> 01:06:41,963
The Moon appears gigantic?

906
01:06:42,452 --> 01:06:44,920
That happens in movies, not in life

907
01:06:45,052 --> 01:06:47,963
Happens in life too -
if you love a person

908
01:06:48,291 --> 01:06:49,327
...not an ass

909
01:06:54,492 --> 01:06:58,963
Hello. What?

910
01:07:00,012 --> 01:07:03,367
Oh God; Ok, I'm on my way

911
01:07:06,452 --> 01:07:08,282
You're a medical student,
right? Need your help

912
01:07:08,371 --> 01:07:10,010
It's an emergency, please
- What?

913
01:07:10,492 --> 01:07:13,563
Please come with me.
What's that oath you doctors take -

914
01:07:13,771 --> 01:07:16,331
You'll never deny a patient help...
The Hippocratic Oath

915
01:07:16,972 --> 01:07:18,724
Please help me,
it's an emergency

916
01:07:23,052 --> 01:07:26,088
You gatecrash my sister's wedding,
break off my engagement...

917
01:07:26,452 --> 01:07:28,726
my dad is popping
BP pills because of you...

918
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:30,724
and here I am, helping you;

919
01:07:31,811 --> 01:07:32,960
Unbelievable;

920
01:07:34,092 --> 01:07:37,800
This Hippocratic Oath -
It's really done us in!

921
01:07:42,452 --> 01:07:44,282
Where's Raju, ma'am?
- Gone to get a cab

922
01:07:44,652 --> 01:07:46,085
Called the ambulance
two hours ago

923
01:07:46,371 --> 01:07:48,840
In this country,
pizza reaches in 30 minutes

924
01:07:49,052 --> 01:07:49,927
but an ambulance...;

925
01:07:50,172 --> 01:07:52,367
He needs hospitalization.
Urgently

926
01:08:05,931 --> 01:08:06,920
Hey stop;

927
01:08:09,132 --> 01:08:11,282
Move, it's an emergency!

928
01:08:12,851 --> 01:08:13,920
Move... move...

929
01:08:15,811 --> 01:08:16,846
Move... move...

930
01:08:20,731 --> 01:08:22,801
Doctor, emergency!

931
01:08:24,332 --> 01:08:25,207
That's the patient

932
01:08:30,931 --> 01:08:32,922
Keep this. Hey, here's Raju

933
01:08:33,412 --> 01:08:35,243
What the hell;
You brought dad on the scooter

934
01:08:37,051 --> 01:08:38,326
Should I've sent him by courier?

935
01:08:38,692 --> 01:08:41,411
No wisecracks on dads profession!
Where is he?

936
01:08:41,971 --> 01:08:43,724
Go ask the doctor

937
01:08:44,652 --> 01:08:47,769
Close call, Pia. A little delay,
we'd have lost him

938
01:08:48,131 --> 01:08:50,770
Glad you didn't wait for an ambulance
and got him on the scooter

939
01:08:50,931 --> 01:08:52,604
Call me if there's a problem

940
01:09:01,171 --> 01:09:04,050
Rancho; Thank you...

941
01:09:05,731 --> 01:09:08,644
Thanking your buddies;
Silencer teaching you manners?

942
01:09:09,811 --> 01:09:12,770
Didn't he teach you -
A friend is man's greatest bosom?

943
01:09:14,492 --> 01:09:17,289
Go on now.
You have an exam tomorrow

944
01:09:17,851 --> 01:09:20,969
Exams we have many...
Dad mostly just one

945
01:09:22,572 --> 01:09:24,766
We won't budge from here
without the Postmaster

946
01:09:25,372 --> 01:09:26,282
Don't worry

947
01:09:33,051 --> 01:09:37,045
Rancho, forgive me.
I was scared

948
01:09:37,292 --> 01:09:39,328
It's ok. Quiet, now

949
01:09:41,771 --> 01:09:43,841
Please forgive me

950
01:09:50,171 --> 01:09:54,051
It's ok, calm down.
Go see your dad

951
01:09:54,572 --> 01:09:55,890
And don't go
with that weepy face

952
01:10:01,931 --> 01:10:02,886
Thanks buddy

953
01:10:14,011 --> 01:10:18,608
Natty scooter. Saved a life.
How much does it cost?

954
01:10:18,891 --> 01:10:21,122
Pour some mint sauce
on it. It'll tell you

955
01:10:23,652 --> 01:10:25,483
Hey, happy Independence Day

956
01:10:25,731 --> 01:10:27,369
Today isn't Independence Day

957
01:10:27,692 --> 01:10:30,729
For you it is! Now you're free
to wear your mom's watch

958
01:10:31,332 --> 01:10:33,970
No ass can say it's an
ancient piece of junk

959
01:10:36,171 --> 01:10:37,002
Hey

960
01:10:38,891 --> 01:10:40,802
How do you know
it was mom's watch?

961
01:10:42,492 --> 01:10:44,846
At your sister's wedding,
you wore sparkling new clothes

962
01:10:45,612 --> 01:10:46,761
Only the watch was old

963
01:10:47,372 --> 01:10:48,247
What could that mean?

964
01:10:50,452 --> 01:10:53,488
You really missed your mom
that day, didn't you?

965
01:10:56,212 --> 01:10:57,201
Yes

966
01:10:58,212 --> 01:10:59,884
Your mom must've been
really beautiful

967
01:11:02,332 --> 01:11:04,402
Yes. How do you know?

968
01:11:04,652 --> 01:11:05,606
Seen your dad?

969
01:11:07,091 --> 01:11:08,684
'Life is a race. If you don't run fast

970
01:11:08,851 --> 01:11:10,409
you'll be a broken egg
...cuckoo bird'

971
01:11:10,811 --> 01:11:11,721
You...

972
01:11:13,931 --> 01:11:21,247
The winds whisper a melody

973
01:11:22,372 --> 01:11:27,923
The sky hums along

974
01:11:29,452 --> 01:11:35,128
Time itself is singing...

975
01:11:36,131 --> 01:11:39,521
Zoobi do...

976
01:11:40,252 --> 01:11:44,643
Param pum

977
01:11:46,212 --> 01:11:50,728
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi pum paara
Zoobi doobi param pum'

978
01:11:51,412 --> 01:11:55,802
My silly heart goes 'Zoobi doobi
zoobi doobi' as it jives and jigs along

979
01:11:56,452 --> 01:12:01,287
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi pum paara
Zoobi doobi param pum'

980
01:12:01,612 --> 01:12:06,082
My silly heart goes 'Zoobi doobi
zoobi doobi' as it jives and jigs along

981
01:12:06,412 --> 01:12:11,280
Leaves sing on their branches
Bees jam with flowers

982
01:12:11,572 --> 01:12:16,202
Crazy sunbeams dance off petals
As birds yodel in the skies

983
01:12:16,771 --> 01:12:21,481
Flowers, bold and brazen
Snuggle and cootchie-coo

984
01:12:21,931 --> 01:12:26,323
I've seen it happen in movies
What's now happening with us

985
01:12:27,332 --> 01:12:31,722
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi pum paara
Zoobi doobi param pum'

986
01:12:32,292 --> 01:12:36,729
My silly heart goes 'Zoobi doobi
zoobi doobi' as it jives and jigs along

987
01:12:37,612 --> 01:12:42,162
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi pum paara
Zoobi doobi param pum'

988
01:12:42,612 --> 01:12:47,402
My silly heart goes 'Zoobi doobi
zoobi doobi' as it jives and jigs along

989
01:12:50,452 --> 01:12:53,363
Let's make the unique and
ever useful mint sauce

990
01:12:53,771 --> 01:12:58,926
The all-powerful sauce that
exposes phony people

991
01:12:59,811 --> 01:13:02,042
Your 7th house is clear

992
01:13:02,532 --> 01:13:04,601
Shunning an ass,
you 'll fall for a human

993
01:13:05,091 --> 01:13:06,729
Time is ripe for love

994
01:13:11,332 --> 01:13:13,208
Temperature in New Delhi
remains stable

995
01:13:13,332 --> 01:13:17,484
Clear skies.
But if in love, expect rain

996
01:13:22,891 --> 01:13:27,328
Pitter-patter go the raindrops
Whish-whoosh whistles the wind

997
01:13:27,811 --> 01:13:32,646
Do-da-dee waltzes the rain
Boom-boom echoes the sky

998
01:13:32,931 --> 01:13:37,801
Drenched in rain and passion
You sway your hips on cue

999
01:13:38,011 --> 01:13:42,608
I've seen it happen in movies
What's now happening with us

1000
01:13:43,452 --> 01:13:47,842
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi pum paara
Zoobi doobi param pum'

1001
01:13:48,652 --> 01:13:52,884
My silly heart goes 'Zoobi doobi
zoobi doobi' as it jives and jigs along

1002
01:13:53,612 --> 01:13:58,162
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi pum paara
Zoobi doobi param pum'

1003
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:03,481
My silly heart goes 'Zoobi doobi
zoobi doobi' as it jives and jigs along

1004
01:14:24,212 --> 01:14:28,682
The gorgeous low moon
Serenades the earth

1005
01:14:29,171 --> 01:14:34,041
A shooting star skips along
Crooning a ballad of love

1006
01:14:34,532 --> 01:14:39,207
The night is bright but lonesome
Come touch me, my handsome

1007
01:14:39,572 --> 01:14:44,202
I've seen it happen in movies
What's now happening with us

1008
01:14:45,051 --> 01:14:49,408
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi pum paara
Zoobi doobi param pum'

1009
01:14:49,931 --> 01:14:54,561
My silly heart goes 'Zoobi doobi
zoobi doobi' as it jives and jigs along

1010
01:14:55,212 --> 01:14:59,489
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi pum paara
Zoobi doobi param pum'

1011
01:15:00,131 --> 01:15:04,886
My silly heart goes 'Zoobi doobi
zoobi doobi' as it jives and jigs along

1012
01:15:05,412 --> 01:15:09,609
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi'
...goes my silly heart

1013
01:15:10,492 --> 01:15:18,126
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi'
...goes my silly heart

1014
01:15:24,492 --> 01:15:25,685
Hello. Wake up

1015
01:15:26,572 --> 01:15:29,086
Huh... Postmaster's dead?
- What;

1016
01:15:29,171 --> 01:15:30,604
No, stupid

1017
01:15:31,011 --> 01:15:33,242
It's 8.30, your exam is at 9

1018
01:15:33,891 --> 01:15:36,167
But we can't leave him alone

1019
01:15:36,492 --> 01:15:39,164
I'm here.
It's a matter of three hours

1020
01:15:39,252 --> 01:15:41,811
Take my scooter.
It's getting late

1021
01:15:42,252 --> 01:15:43,240
Hey...

1022
01:15:47,488 --> 01:15:48,806
Gosh, what an ancient watch

1023
01:15:55,087 --> 01:15:55,997
Go

1024
01:16:13,368 --> 01:16:15,676
Sorry, we're late
- It was an emergency

1025
01:16:21,328 --> 01:16:22,396
Settle down there

1026
01:16:26,768 --> 01:16:27,962
Sir, they're still writing

1027
01:16:29,328 --> 01:16:30,886
Hello. Time up

1028
01:16:31,688 --> 01:16:34,202
Please, five minutes.
We started half an hour late

1029
01:16:34,368 --> 01:16:35,516
It was an emergency

1030
01:16:35,608 --> 01:16:39,725
He glared at us like we 'd
asked for both his kidneys

1031
01:16:40,887 --> 01:16:42,002
But we continued writing

1032
01:16:42,927 --> 01:16:45,840
He continued arranging
the answer sheets

1033
01:16:54,007 --> 01:16:54,884
Done, sir

1034
01:16:55,847 --> 01:16:58,362
You're late.
I can't accept these

1035
01:16:58,568 --> 01:16:59,398
Sir, please, sir

1036
01:17:03,768 --> 01:17:05,042
Sir, do you know who we are?

1037
01:17:06,448 --> 01:17:08,199
Prime Ministers son?
Even then...

1038
01:17:08,488 --> 01:17:10,479
I will not accept your paper

1039
01:17:11,927 --> 01:17:13,838
Do you know
our names and roll numbers?

1040
01:17:15,087 --> 01:17:16,157
No...

1041
01:17:17,927 --> 01:17:18,917
Who are you?

1042
01:17:19,007 --> 01:17:20,918
He doesn't know: Run!

1043
01:17:22,528 --> 01:17:24,722
Hey, what's your roll number?

1044
01:17:25,488 --> 01:17:29,605
Where the hell are their papers?

1045
01:17:33,927 --> 01:17:35,680
O Lord, have mercy

1046
01:17:35,768 --> 01:17:41,319
Today was Results day.
Time to make a deal with God

1047
01:17:41,448 --> 01:17:43,837
Just save my Electronics.
I'll offer a coconut

1048
01:17:44,287 --> 01:17:48,997
Sir Snake, bless my Physics.
I promise a pint of milk per day

1049
01:17:49,207 --> 01:17:52,484
O Mother Cow,
help me pass... have this grass

1050
01:17:52,728 --> 01:17:55,925
I vow: No X-rated thoughts
of girls in my class...

1051
01:17:56,207 --> 01:17:57,606
Watch over my results

1052
01:17:57,807 --> 01:18:01,516
God of Wealth, I'll offer 100 /-
every month

1053
01:18:01,728 --> 01:18:04,242
100 /- won't bribe even a traffic cop

1054
01:18:04,927 --> 01:18:06,680
let alone the Almighty

1055
01:18:07,847 --> 01:18:09,838
Check from the bottom

1056
01:18:10,807 --> 01:18:12,844
You are... last

1057
01:18:14,488 --> 01:18:15,363
And you?

1058
01:18:17,328 --> 01:18:18,726
Second last

1059
01:18:20,247 --> 01:18:21,283
Rancho?

1060
01:18:25,528 --> 01:18:26,563
Not there

1061
01:18:27,887 --> 01:18:28,877
My heart sank

1062
01:18:29,448 --> 01:18:33,680
Not 'cause our ranks tanked,
but 'cause our friend flunked

1063
01:18:36,047 --> 01:18:39,596
There's a mistake.
It's not possible. It's injustice

1064
01:18:43,568 --> 01:18:46,365
What's Silencer howling about?

1065
01:18:46,967 --> 01:18:47,877
He got the second rank

1066
01:18:49,728 --> 01:18:51,127
Who's first?

1067
01:18:52,287 --> 01:18:53,356
Rancho

1068
01:18:55,768 --> 01:18:56,962
Rancho?

1069
01:18:59,328 --> 01:19:00,123
Move aside

1070
01:19:04,728 --> 01:19:06,922
We learned a lesson
in Human Behavior:

1071
01:19:07,688 --> 01:19:12,841
Your friend fails, you feel bad.
Your friend tops, you feel worse

1072
01:19:13,528 --> 01:19:17,760
We were sad.
Two others were sadder

1073
01:19:18,967 --> 01:19:22,676
Ranchhoddas Chanchad.
Front row. Right of the Director

1074
01:19:23,287 --> 01:19:25,483
Uday Sinha. Second row. Third seat

1075
01:19:26,368 --> 01:19:29,484
Alok Mittal. Second row. Fifth seat

1076
01:19:31,207 --> 01:19:33,768
Sahili Rao. Third row...

1077
01:19:33,927 --> 01:19:36,283
Sir, why this seating
according to rank?

1078
01:19:37,408 --> 01:19:38,601
Any problem with that?

1079
01:19:38,728 --> 01:19:42,686
Yes, this grading system is
like a caste system

1080
01:19:43,127 --> 01:19:46,164
A-graders: Masters
C-graders: Slaves

1081
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:49,599
It's not nice, sir
- You have a better idea?

1082
01:19:50,167 --> 01:19:54,161
Yes. Results should not be
displayed at all

1083
01:19:54,608 --> 01:19:58,520
Why publicise someone's flaws?

1084
01:19:58,807 --> 01:20:03,643
If your iron count is low,
will the doctor prescribe tonic...

1085
01:20:03,768 --> 01:20:05,167
or air your report on TV

1086
01:20:05,967 --> 01:20:07,002
You see, sir?

1087
01:20:07,568 --> 01:20:09,286
So basically,
what you are saying is

1088
01:20:09,768 --> 01:20:11,485
I should personally go to
each student's room

1089
01:20:12,488 --> 01:20:13,523
and whisper in his ears...

1090
01:20:14,528 --> 01:20:16,837
'You have come first';
'You're second';

1091
01:20:16,927 --> 01:20:18,440
'Oh, I'm so sorry,
you have failed'

1092
01:20:21,328 --> 01:20:25,525
No sir, I mean
grades create a divide

1093
01:20:27,768 --> 01:20:29,645
I've topped, so I'm next to you

1094
01:20:29,887 --> 01:20:32,197
My pals came last,
they're in the back corner

1095
01:20:32,368 --> 01:20:33,846
At least they're in the corner

1096
01:20:33,967 --> 01:20:36,277
More time with you, and
they'll be out of the photo

1097
01:20:37,368 --> 01:20:39,279
They will neither pass,
nor get a job

1098
01:20:40,047 --> 01:20:43,756
They'll get jobs, sir.
There must be some firm that...

1099
01:20:44,207 --> 01:20:45,960
prefers humans to machines

1100
01:20:47,768 --> 01:20:49,520
They'll get jobs. I guarantee

1101
01:20:51,448 --> 01:20:53,677
You guarantee it;

1102
01:20:53,887 --> 01:20:55,367
Bet, sir?

1103
01:20:58,608 --> 01:20:59,881
Govind
- Yes, sir?

1104
01:21:03,887 --> 01:21:07,038
Even if one of them gets
a job in campus interviews...

1105
01:21:08,207 --> 01:21:09,356
shave off my moustache

1106
01:21:12,007 --> 01:21:12,837
Sir!

1107
01:21:13,127 --> 01:21:16,039
Happy?
- Smile, please

1108
01:21:17,287 --> 01:21:18,198
Happy, sir

1109
01:21:22,967 --> 01:21:25,845
Jackass;
Honking to hide your tooting

1110
01:21:26,368 --> 01:21:28,962
Septic tank; Popping pills again?

1111
01:21:29,207 --> 01:21:31,768
I didn't do it... Raju?

1112
01:21:31,967 --> 01:21:33,525
This is a familiar stink

1113
01:21:33,608 --> 01:21:36,520
He's the sole cause for
global warming

1114
01:22:00,768 --> 01:22:03,282
Toss me your wallet: I'll buy pants

1115
01:22:03,847 --> 01:22:07,841
Take Chatur's suit instead
- Don't touch my suit

1116
01:22:08,967 --> 01:22:10,685
Rancho'll recognize you
even in underwear

1117
01:22:10,847 --> 01:22:14,681
Where's this?
- If I could read, would I sell peanuts?

1118
01:22:14,887 --> 01:22:17,355
He can't read
- But he can speak

1119
01:22:17,568 --> 01:22:21,402
Wait. Do you know a
Ranchhoddas Chanchad?

1120
01:22:21,608 --> 01:22:23,279
Yes, he lives there

1121
01:22:23,927 --> 01:22:29,047
Free as the wind was he

1122
01:22:30,967 --> 01:22:36,167
Like a soaring kite was he

1123
01:22:37,768 --> 01:22:39,962
Where did he go...

1124
01:22:40,167 --> 01:22:42,318
let's find him

1125
01:22:42,448 --> 01:22:45,007
Chatur, your pills
- Thanks. Where were they?

1126
01:22:45,047 --> 01:22:47,481
In the pocket
- Hey, my pants!

1127
01:22:47,608 --> 01:22:49,519
Karl Marx says to
share all resources

1128
01:22:51,047 --> 01:22:52,925
Hey, you'll give people ideas

1129
01:22:54,408 --> 01:22:55,396
I want it now

1130
01:23:10,047 --> 01:23:11,117
What happened?

1131
01:23:13,167 --> 01:23:14,317
Rancho's father

1132
01:23:17,688 --> 01:23:20,327
Excuse me,
where is Ranchhoddas?

1133
01:23:21,127 --> 01:23:23,436
There he is
- Thank you

1134
01:23:45,688 --> 01:23:48,725
Rancho...
- Yes?

1135
01:23:49,287 --> 01:23:52,837
Sorry. We're looking for Ranchhoddas

1136
01:23:53,807 --> 01:23:55,082
I am Ranchhoddas

1137
01:23:55,648 --> 01:23:59,402
No, I mean... 'Ranchhoddas
Shamaldas Chanchad'

1138
01:24:00,768 --> 01:24:03,235
Ranchhoddas Shamaldas
Chanchad. That's me

1139
01:24:08,488 --> 01:24:10,682
Ranchhoddas, take care, son

1140
01:24:29,207 --> 01:24:31,243
'Ranchhoddas Chanchad'

1141
01:24:38,127 --> 01:24:39,117
Raju

1142
01:25:03,368 --> 01:25:06,837
I'll be in the Guinness Book for
driving Delhi-Shimla in underwear

1143
01:25:06,967 --> 01:25:08,037
That too, for the wrong guy;

1144
01:25:08,528 --> 01:25:12,315
Same name, same degree,
same photo, but a different guy

1145
01:25:12,847 --> 01:25:14,280
What's going on?

1146
01:25:14,967 --> 01:25:17,528
How did Silencer get
Rancho's address?

1147
01:25:18,648 --> 01:25:19,478
Good point!

1148
01:25:20,847 --> 01:25:22,201
Hey Chatur, come here

1149
01:25:28,247 --> 01:25:31,604
How dare you open this?
I got this from San Francisco

1150
01:25:31,648 --> 01:25:33,127
Handmade biscuits

1151
01:25:34,847 --> 01:25:37,042
Specially for Mr. Phunsukh Wangdu

1152
01:25:37,287 --> 01:25:39,358
Phunsukh Bangdu?
Who's that?

1153
01:25:39,448 --> 01:25:43,838
Not Bangdu. Wangdu. 'W'.
Phunsukh Wangdu

1154
01:25:43,967 --> 01:25:46,686
Do you know who that is?
He's a great scientist

1155
01:25:46,768 --> 01:25:49,362
400 patents.
The world wants him

1156
01:25:50,368 --> 01:25:53,677
Took me a year
to get an appointment

1157
01:25:54,408 --> 01:25:59,640
Once he signs the deal with
my company, I'll be huge!

1158
01:25:59,728 --> 01:26:03,720
Forget Wangdu.
How'd you get Rancho's address?

1159
01:26:03,847 --> 01:26:05,725
You should be thanking
Phunsukh Wangdu

1160
01:26:06,087 --> 01:26:09,524
He led me to Rancho, See this

1161
01:26:11,608 --> 01:26:15,840
My secretary was here to fix
an appointment with Wangdu

1162
01:26:15,967 --> 01:26:20,119
She didn't get the appointment.
But I found Rancho

1163
01:26:20,247 --> 01:26:25,640
I checked the Shimla directory
and found Rancho's name

1164
01:26:25,688 --> 01:26:27,279
What happened to his face?

1165
01:26:27,648 --> 01:26:29,842
Plastic surgery
in honor of your visit?

1166
01:26:34,087 --> 01:26:35,840
Only one man has the answer

1167
01:26:36,408 --> 01:26:40,845
Sorry Papa,
I couldn't fulfill your last wish

1168
01:26:42,287 --> 01:26:45,917
You kept asking me
to take you on pilgrimage

1169
01:26:46,807 --> 01:26:49,197
But I waited
for the highway tender

1170
01:26:50,648 --> 01:26:54,926
There the tender opened,
here you closed your eyes

1171
01:26:58,847 --> 01:27:03,159
I am so sorry, Papa.
I could not be a good son...

1172
01:27:03,328 --> 01:27:04,601
Wrong

1173
01:27:05,047 --> 01:27:07,766
You're an engineer.
Your degree's on the wall!

1174
01:27:08,047 --> 01:27:09,275
You were a very good son

1175
01:27:11,807 --> 01:27:16,359
How dare you barge in?
I'll have you arrested

1176
01:27:16,528 --> 01:27:19,600
No, you'll be arrested.
We've made enquiries

1177
01:27:19,847 --> 01:27:22,840
You use the degree
to clinch contracts

1178
01:27:23,287 --> 01:27:26,404
It's our friend's degree.
How did you get it?

1179
01:27:41,368 --> 01:27:42,720
This is a 150 acre estate

1180
01:27:43,127 --> 01:27:46,199
If I shoot and bury you,
no one would even notice

1181
01:27:46,528 --> 01:27:47,404
Get the point?

1182
01:27:48,688 --> 01:27:49,518
Now get lost

1183
01:27:54,847 --> 01:27:59,000
I'm taking Papa's ashes to the
sacred river. Can take yours too

1184
01:28:06,167 --> 01:28:07,680
Grab Papa!

1185
01:28:10,488 --> 01:28:11,556
Here, here

1186
01:28:15,528 --> 01:28:16,516
Let go of Papa;

1187
01:28:19,328 --> 01:28:22,046
Tell the truth or
Papa is flushed;

1188
01:28:22,167 --> 01:28:24,966
Hand over Papa
- Papa goes to the sacred sewer

1189
01:28:25,648 --> 01:28:28,845
Get Papa out of the potty
- You pull trigger, I pull flush.

1190
01:28:28,967 --> 01:28:30,242
I'll count to three

1191
01:28:30,287 --> 01:28:33,837
Wanna shoot us?
Raju, scatter the ashes

1192
01:28:36,448 --> 01:28:37,403
One

1193
01:28:37,568 --> 01:28:42,118
Take us down,
and Papa's down the drain

1194
01:28:43,328 --> 01:28:44,203
Two

1195
01:28:44,287 --> 01:28:46,643
Then grope for him in the gutter

1196
01:28:46,768 --> 01:28:47,597
What is it, Raju?

1197
01:28:48,967 --> 01:28:51,356
We've got the wrong urn.
It's empty;

1198
01:28:52,207 --> 01:28:53,083
Empty?

1199
01:28:54,408 --> 01:28:57,717
Empty: we'll empty it out;

1200
01:28:57,847 --> 01:28:58,677
No, no;

1201
01:28:58,768 --> 01:29:01,520
We'll empty it out

1202
01:29:01,608 --> 01:29:03,962
No... hands up!

1203
01:29:06,167 --> 01:29:09,079
Who are you?

1204
01:29:09,247 --> 01:29:10,317
I am Rancho

1205
01:29:11,568 --> 01:29:13,922
I swear on Papa, it's true

1206
01:29:14,127 --> 01:29:15,845
I am Rancho;
That was Chhote.

1207
01:29:16,927 --> 01:29:17,724
Chhote?

1208
01:29:19,047 --> 01:29:23,837
He was our gardener's son, Chhote

1209
01:29:25,728 --> 01:29:28,447
He stayed on with us
after he was orphaned

1210
01:29:30,568 --> 01:29:38,077
Did odd jobs around the house,
ran errands

1211
01:29:39,448 --> 01:29:40,676
He had a passion for learning

1212
01:29:43,807 --> 01:29:46,368
He'd wear my old uniform
and slip into school

1213
01:29:48,287 --> 01:29:51,121
And attend any class he liked.
It suited me

1214
01:29:52,047 --> 01:29:57,838
I made him do my homework,
take my exams

1215
01:29:58,368 --> 01:30:01,279
It was going well, till
one day...

1216
01:30:01,688 --> 01:30:06,078
Our teacher saw a sixth grader
doing tenth grade math

1217
01:30:06,127 --> 01:30:07,606
Which grade are you in, son?

1218
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:09,917
What's your name?

1219
01:30:10,847 --> 01:30:11,757
We got caught

1220
01:30:12,847 --> 01:30:14,201
Papa was a powerful man, so...

1221
01:30:14,328 --> 01:30:17,684
our teacher alerted him
before going to the Principal

1222
01:30:18,167 --> 01:30:21,956
You started it, you will finish it

1223
01:30:24,568 --> 01:30:27,240
People pretend to show me respect

1224
01:30:27,927 --> 01:30:30,043
But behind my back...

1225
01:30:30,967 --> 01:30:32,525
mock me as an illiterate

1226
01:30:33,488 --> 01:30:35,444
I won't let that happen to my son

1227
01:30:36,488 --> 01:30:40,640
This boy wants to study.
I want just a degree

1228
01:30:41,167 --> 01:30:43,045
Let the game go on

1229
01:30:44,007 --> 01:30:45,565
Make this kid an engineer

1230
01:30:46,768 --> 01:30:51,921
and I'll have a degree
in my son's name on that wall

1231
01:30:52,247 --> 01:30:56,082
I went to London for four years,
he went to college as me

1232
01:30:57,688 --> 01:31:03,604
He'd promised to cut contact with all
after getting the degree

1233
01:31:05,568 --> 01:31:13,805
But he always said,
'Two idiots will come looking for me'

1234
01:31:18,328 --> 01:31:19,920
He really misses you both

1235
01:31:22,247 --> 01:31:26,036
I'll give you his address,
go to him

1236
01:31:29,247 --> 01:31:32,604
But please keep my secret

1237
01:31:34,408 --> 01:31:35,523
What secret?

1238
01:31:48,328 --> 01:31:51,684
You got the wrong urn, sir.
Papa is in here

1239
01:31:53,807 --> 01:31:56,275
What the hell's going on?
Who was that gun guy?

1240
01:31:56,328 --> 01:31:59,717
Complicated story.
Without subtitles. Not for you

1241
01:31:59,768 --> 01:32:01,962
Ignore it
- Where're we going?

1242
01:32:03,247 --> 01:32:04,123
Ladakh

1243
01:32:04,167 --> 01:32:05,487
Ladakh! Why?

1244
01:32:06,167 --> 01:32:07,078
To meet Rancho

1245
01:32:07,247 --> 01:32:10,126
What's he doing in Ladakh?

1246
01:32:10,167 --> 01:32:13,604
No clue. We have
the address of a school

1247
01:32:13,847 --> 01:32:16,805
School teacher!

1248
01:32:17,648 --> 01:32:20,923
I'm Vice President of
Rockledge Corporation, and he...

1249
01:32:21,328 --> 01:32:23,523
A for Apple, B for Ball...

1250
01:32:23,688 --> 01:32:24,837
D for Donkey

1251
01:32:25,528 --> 01:32:30,283
Next week I sign a huge deal
with Phunsukh Wangdu

1252
01:32:30,448 --> 01:32:33,359
And he... A for Apple, B for Ball...

1253
01:32:36,927 --> 01:32:39,237
Today my respect
for that idiot shot up

1254
01:32:40,127 --> 01:32:42,358
Most of us went to college
just for a degree

1255
01:32:42,927 --> 01:32:46,966
No degree meant
no plum job, no pretty wife...

1256
01:32:47,247 --> 01:32:49,716
no credit card, no social status

1257
01:32:50,368 --> 01:32:52,119
None of this mattered to him

1258
01:32:52,247 --> 01:32:54,000
He was in college
for the joy of learning

1259
01:32:54,488 --> 01:32:57,639
He never cared
if he was first or last

1260
01:32:58,207 --> 01:33:00,438
Who was the first man
on the Moon?

1261
01:33:00,688 --> 01:33:01,837
Neil Armstrong, sir

1262
01:33:01,927 --> 01:33:03,997
Obviously, it is Neil Armstrong.
We all know it

1263
01:33:04,167 --> 01:33:05,362
Who was the second?

1264
01:33:05,847 --> 01:33:07,405
Don't waste your time.
It's not important

1265
01:33:07,847 --> 01:33:10,237
Nobody remembers the man
who ever came second

1266
01:33:11,328 --> 01:33:16,560
Soon, 26 companies
will be here with job offers

1267
01:33:17,007 --> 01:33:22,445
You'll have a job
even before your final exam

1268
01:33:23,167 --> 01:33:24,965
This is your last lap, my friends

1269
01:33:25,287 --> 01:33:27,404
Put the pedal to the metal.
Step on the gas

1270
01:33:27,488 --> 01:33:29,399
Go out there and make history!

1271
01:33:32,688 --> 01:33:33,837
Any questions?

1272
01:33:36,287 --> 01:33:37,163
Yes?

1273
01:33:38,448 --> 01:33:41,917
Sir, suppose a student gets a job...

1274
01:33:42,287 --> 01:33:49,284
but narrowly fails the final exam,
will he still have the job?

1275
01:33:49,768 --> 01:33:51,042
Very good question

1276
01:33:54,167 --> 01:33:56,443
Anyone else
with the same question?

1277
01:33:58,287 --> 01:33:59,561
As expected

1278
01:34:01,807 --> 01:34:04,800
Please come on stage.
Give them a big hand

1279
01:34:15,528 --> 01:34:17,722
For the last four years

1280
01:34:17,768 --> 01:34:20,600
they've been our most
consistent students

1281
01:34:20,728 --> 01:34:23,925
Consistently last in every exam

1282
01:34:24,728 --> 01:34:26,046
Come my geniuses, come

1283
01:34:27,448 --> 01:34:32,841
Their brains will fetch
a handsome price

1284
01:34:33,528 --> 01:34:36,439
'Cause they're completely unused

1285
01:34:38,847 --> 01:34:40,042
And to answer their question -

1286
01:34:40,408 --> 01:34:43,604
The exam won't affect their jobs

1287
01:34:44,368 --> 01:34:47,757
Because no company
will hire them anyway!

1288
01:34:48,568 --> 01:34:51,479
They're so unique, their
names will be writ in gold -

1289
01:34:51,768 --> 01:34:54,565
'Farhanitrate' and 'Prerajulization'

1290
01:34:54,648 --> 01:34:56,081
Give them a big hand,
please, everybody

1291
01:35:04,807 --> 01:35:09,484
He screwed us;

1292
01:35:09,608 --> 01:35:11,484
In front of everyone

1293
01:35:12,568 --> 01:35:17,483
God, I'll give up meat,
light a 1000 incense sticks

1294
01:35:17,568 --> 01:35:19,286
Do me just one favor -

1295
01:35:19,368 --> 01:35:21,722
Delete Virus!

1296
01:35:23,287 --> 01:35:25,198
Burn him in hell

1297
01:35:26,528 --> 01:35:30,203
Fry Virus-nuggets in bubbling oil

1298
01:35:30,927 --> 01:35:33,680
You think God is a contract killer?

1299
01:35:34,287 --> 01:35:35,515
You shut up

1300
01:35:36,207 --> 01:35:39,006
You're in the center
of the photo every year

1301
01:35:39,047 --> 01:35:40,925
We're rotting in the corner

1302
01:35:41,927 --> 01:35:44,840
This year we may fall
out of the photo altogether

1303
01:35:47,207 --> 01:35:48,960
Know why I come first?
- Why?

1304
01:35:49,368 --> 01:35:51,006
Because I love machines

1305
01:35:51,768 --> 01:35:53,520
Engineering is my passion

1306
01:35:54,528 --> 01:35:55,721
Know your passion?

1307
01:35:58,448 --> 01:36:00,086
That's my bag
- Be quiet

1308
01:36:01,007 --> 01:36:02,282
What're you up to?

1309
01:36:04,608 --> 01:36:06,677
This... is your passion

1310
01:36:07,847 --> 01:36:09,247
Go post this letter

1311
01:36:09,608 --> 01:36:10,836
What letter?

1312
01:36:13,488 --> 01:36:17,605
5 years ago he wrote this for
his favorite wildlife photographer

1313
01:36:18,328 --> 01:36:21,001
Andre...
- Istvan

1314
01:36:21,927 --> 01:36:25,398
He wanted to train with him
in Hungary

1315
01:36:26,287 --> 01:36:29,484
But in fear of his dad, the Fuhrer,
never posted it

1316
01:36:31,127 --> 01:36:34,564
Quit Engineering, marry Photography

1317
01:36:35,488 --> 01:36:37,399
Follow your talent

1318
01:36:40,408 --> 01:36:44,287
If Michael Jackson's dad
forced him to be a boxer...

1319
01:36:45,047 --> 01:36:48,438
and Mohammad Ali's dad
pushed him to be a singer...

1320
01:36:49,127 --> 01:36:50,402
imagine the disaster

1321
01:36:52,368 --> 01:36:54,801
Do you get it?

1322
01:36:58,207 --> 01:37:01,404
Idiot; Loves Photography,
but is marrying machines

1323
01:37:05,847 --> 01:37:07,201
Your Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas

1324
01:37:08,448 --> 01:37:12,440
Engineering is
my wife and mistress both

1325
01:37:13,807 --> 01:37:16,242
But I still fail. Why?
- Explain

1326
01:37:17,328 --> 01:37:19,603
'Cause you're a coward,
scared of the future

1327
01:37:21,247 --> 01:37:25,560
Look at this -
more holy rings than fingers

1328
01:37:26,087 --> 01:37:29,159
One ring per fear -
exam, sis's dowry, job

1329
01:37:30,568 --> 01:37:34,197
With such fear of tomorrow,
how'll you live today?

1330
01:37:35,007 --> 01:37:36,600
How'll you focus on studies?

1331
01:37:37,847 --> 01:37:40,840
Strange buddies; One lives
in fear, the other in pretense

1332
01:37:41,807 --> 01:37:46,962
You live in both: fear and pretense

1333
01:37:47,167 --> 01:37:53,003
You're scared to tell Pia you
love her... so you pretend you don't

1334
01:37:55,408 --> 01:37:57,399
What rubbish!

1335
01:37:58,007 --> 01:38:01,921
Easy to offer free advice,
tough to follow it

1336
01:38:02,007 --> 01:38:05,125
Have the guts? Go confess to Pia.

1337
01:38:05,568 --> 01:38:09,277
There's no connection!
- Deep connection, Your Holiness

1338
01:38:09,368 --> 01:38:14,646
Listen, if you confess to Pia

1339
01:38:15,047 --> 01:38:19,326
I'll tell Dad: No Engineering,
I'm marrying Photography

1340
01:38:20,448 --> 01:38:23,962
And I'll dump my rings
before the job interview

1341
01:38:24,368 --> 01:38:25,403
Deal?

1342
01:38:27,528 --> 01:38:29,119
Have the guts?

1343
01:38:29,247 --> 01:38:31,443
His Holiness is speechless

1344
01:38:37,247 --> 01:38:38,078
Let's go

1345
01:38:42,927 --> 01:38:44,202
Follow me
- Where?

1346
01:38:49,608 --> 01:38:51,087
Let's go

1347
01:38:51,568 --> 01:38:54,568
Hey Virus; I'm anti-Virus

1348
01:38:54,568 --> 01:38:56,207
Hope no dog here

1349
01:38:56,207 --> 01:38:58,438
Cowards! Let's go

1350
01:38:58,568 --> 01:39:02,117
If any danger,
I'll give the Virus alert

1351
01:39:13,847 --> 01:39:15,405
Beware: Virus inside

1352
01:39:35,167 --> 01:39:36,317
Need background score?

1353
01:39:36,528 --> 01:39:37,483
Pia
- Who's it?

1354
01:39:40,127 --> 01:39:43,676
Don't yell! It's me, Rancho

1355
01:39:45,528 --> 01:39:48,804
Just listen for a moment,
then I'm gone

1356
01:39:49,087 --> 01:39:51,396
Say not a word...

1357
01:39:51,728 --> 01:39:52,682
Pia...
- Yes?

1358
01:39:54,728 --> 01:39:57,925
Those 22 minutes with you
on the scooter

1359
01:39:58,728 --> 01:40:03,118
were the most enchanting
22 minutes of my life

1360
01:40:07,368 --> 01:40:12,567
I could spend an eternity
with you on the scooter

1361
01:40:12,688 --> 01:40:13,518
Wow

1362
01:40:14,728 --> 01:40:17,720
...and time stands still

1363
01:40:18,728 --> 01:40:25,838
Every night you ride into my dreams
on your scooter, dressed as a bride

1364
01:40:28,728 --> 01:40:30,957
Instead of a veil,
you lift your helmet

1365
01:40:34,287 --> 01:40:37,121
and come close to kiss me

1366
01:40:40,087 --> 01:40:42,283
But that kiss doesn't happen

1367
01:40:43,087 --> 01:40:43,963
Why?

1368
01:40:44,287 --> 01:40:47,324
Because the noses collide,
and I wake up

1369
01:40:48,368 --> 01:40:49,960
The noses never collide, stupid!

1370
01:40:54,847 --> 01:40:57,840
I'm sorry,
I thought you were Pia

1371
01:40:58,408 --> 01:40:59,318
I wish I was

1372
01:40:59,608 --> 01:41:01,326
Sis, why did you interrupt?

1373
01:41:01,768 --> 01:41:03,520
It took him four years
to say this

1374
01:41:03,728 --> 01:41:06,640
Pia, kiss him.
Show that noses don't collide

1375
01:41:06,728 --> 01:41:09,845
You have my permission,
kiss him... He's so cute!

1376
01:41:10,368 --> 01:41:11,960
Who's this?
- My sister

1377
01:41:12,927 --> 01:41:13,917
Who're you?

1378
01:41:23,207 --> 01:41:26,802
When you were talking,
he kicked. First time;

1379
01:41:26,847 --> 01:41:30,523
He? How do you know
it's a 'he' or 'she'?

1380
01:41:30,807 --> 01:41:34,686
Papa asked the astrologer If we'd
get an engineer or a doctor

1381
01:41:35,608 --> 01:41:36,484
Meaning?

1382
01:41:36,648 --> 01:41:39,400
Boy becomes an engineer,
girl a doctor

1383
01:41:40,167 --> 01:41:45,447
Champ, better stay inside.
Out here's a circus

1384
01:41:46,488 --> 01:41:50,082
Your grandpa is the ringmaster.
He'll crack his whip -

1385
01:41:50,207 --> 01:41:55,407
'Run! Life is a race.
Be an engineer'

1386
01:41:56,207 --> 01:42:01,235
But you follow your heart.
If grandpa scares you...

1387
01:42:02,007 --> 01:42:05,238
put your hand on your heart
and say, 'All is well'

1388
01:42:06,087 --> 01:42:06,837
He kicked

1389
01:42:08,768 --> 01:42:09,802
Say it again

1390
01:42:10,967 --> 01:42:12,525
All is well

1391
01:42:13,368 --> 01:42:15,006
Kicked again

1392
01:42:16,568 --> 01:42:19,445
Once more
- All is well

1393
01:42:23,768 --> 01:42:27,761
All is well

1394
01:42:28,328 --> 01:42:29,238
Who is it?

1395
01:42:30,047 --> 01:42:31,002
Go

1396
01:42:31,648 --> 01:42:36,483
You sent hate-mail to Dad,
here's pee-mail for you

1397
01:42:36,568 --> 01:42:40,845
Enjoy the pee-mail, happy reading;

1398
01:42:47,047 --> 01:42:49,686
Who is it?
- Your future son-in-law

1399
01:42:49,927 --> 01:42:51,360
And the wedding party

1400
01:42:52,167 --> 01:42:53,203
Rastogi;

1401
01:42:55,528 --> 01:42:57,279
Security, that way

1402
01:43:25,688 --> 01:43:29,283
So you all have already learned
about the simple pendulum

1403
01:43:29,967 --> 01:43:33,721
Now let's get down to the advanced
study about compound pendulum

1404
01:43:35,087 --> 01:43:38,921
It's an irregular object
oscillating about its own axis

1405
01:43:39,328 --> 01:43:40,363
Let me demonstrate to you

1406
01:43:40,927 --> 01:43:42,805
What's this?
- Pencil

1407
01:43:43,087 --> 01:43:44,487
What's inside?
- Lead

1408
01:43:44,528 --> 01:43:46,597
Good. Lead is the axis to this pencil

1409
01:43:47,087 --> 01:43:49,966
Even you can be a compound
pendulum, if you oscillate about...

1410
01:43:57,287 --> 01:43:59,801
Where is Raju Rastogi?
- Present, sir

1411
01:44:06,967 --> 01:44:08,798
Hi. Everybody is here

1412
01:44:10,408 --> 01:44:11,443
Good morning, sir

1413
01:44:12,328 --> 01:44:13,476
Where were you last night?

1414
01:44:14,007 --> 01:44:16,966
Studying all night, sir
- Studying?

1415
01:44:17,127 --> 01:44:18,037
Really?

1416
01:44:18,167 --> 01:44:21,046
Hasn't slept two nights,
that's why he looks scruffy

1417
01:44:21,127 --> 01:44:22,003
Not slept?

1418
01:44:22,167 --> 01:44:23,157
What did you study?

1419
01:44:24,207 --> 01:44:28,087
Induction motor, sir.
The whole chapter

1420
01:44:28,368 --> 01:44:29,243
Whole chapter?

1421
01:44:29,448 --> 01:44:31,404
In that case, Mr. Ra ju Rastogi...

1422
01:44:31,488 --> 01:44:32,363
Yessir!

1423
01:44:32,488 --> 01:44:35,047
Can you tell us how an
induction motor starts?

1424
01:44:42,807 --> 01:44:43,684
Stop it

1425
01:44:51,047 --> 01:44:53,243
Sir, rum

1426
01:44:55,047 --> 01:44:56,037
Mr. Rastogi

1427
01:44:56,488 --> 01:44:58,762
Let's have a cup of tea
in my office

1428
01:45:04,608 --> 01:45:05,518
Sir?

1429
01:45:06,648 --> 01:45:07,524
Close the door

1430
01:45:12,568 --> 01:45:13,603
Can you type?

1431
01:45:14,847 --> 01:45:15,677
Yes, sir

1432
01:45:15,847 --> 01:45:17,280
Will you type a letter for me?

1433
01:45:19,287 --> 01:45:20,323
Definitely, sir

1434
01:45:20,608 --> 01:45:21,518
Come, sit

1435
01:45:22,247 --> 01:45:23,237
Sir, I'm sorry sir...

1436
01:45:25,528 --> 01:45:26,438
Please type

1437
01:45:28,047 --> 01:45:28,844
Dear Sir...

1438
01:45:29,768 --> 01:45:33,043
It is my painful duty to inform you...

1439
01:45:34,287 --> 01:45:36,847
that your son is rusticated...

1440
01:45:37,608 --> 01:45:40,076
No, sorry, delete that.
Go back

1441
01:45:40,768 --> 01:45:44,680
Your son, Mr. Raju Rastogi...

1442
01:45:45,728 --> 01:45:49,720
is rusticated from the
Imperial College of Engineering

1443
01:45:50,287 --> 01:45:51,640
Come on, type

1444
01:45:58,807 --> 01:46:00,445
It'll kill my dad, sir

1445
01:46:00,608 --> 01:46:02,326
Please type
- Sir, please sir

1446
01:46:02,768 --> 01:46:06,555
My decision is final and
irrevocable

1447
01:46:08,528 --> 01:46:13,476
He lives just to see me
become an engineer

1448
01:46:13,528 --> 01:46:17,645
Should've thought of that
before peeing on my door

1449
01:46:17,768 --> 01:46:22,046
Sir, give me one chance... please

1450
01:46:27,408 --> 01:46:30,684
Ok, remove your name
from the letter...

1451
01:46:31,967 --> 01:46:34,037
and put in Rancho's

1452
01:46:35,408 --> 01:46:37,524
I know he was with you
last night

1453
01:46:38,328 --> 01:46:42,240
Be my witness and
I'll spare you

1454
01:46:45,648 --> 01:46:49,527
You have 7 1/2 minutes to think

1455
01:47:34,728 --> 01:47:39,483
We won't let go of you

1456
01:47:40,847 --> 01:47:46,127
We're not done yet... no way

1457
01:47:48,167 --> 01:47:51,239
The heavens may beckon you

1458
01:47:51,328 --> 01:47:54,399
But we'll take up arms against God

1459
01:47:54,448 --> 01:48:00,283
And it's not a fight we intend to lose

1460
01:48:00,807 --> 01:48:03,800
You may try your best to escape

1461
01:48:03,927 --> 01:48:07,000
Try with all your might

1462
01:48:07,167 --> 01:48:13,515
But there is no way
we are letting go of you

1463
01:48:14,087 --> 01:48:19,923
We won't let go of you

1464
01:48:20,368 --> 01:48:26,398
We're not done yet... no way

1465
01:48:28,167 --> 01:48:30,806
Rancho, watch that monitor

1466
01:48:31,087 --> 01:48:31,837
Raju

1467
01:48:33,568 --> 01:48:36,604
His body is paralyzed with shock,
but his mind is alert

1468
01:48:37,087 --> 01:48:41,239
He can see and hear us.
Please don't cry in front of him

1469
01:48:43,007 --> 01:48:47,239
Speak to him normally,
motivate him, joke around

1470
01:48:50,127 --> 01:48:52,688
Good news, Raju.
Your dad's recovered

1471
01:48:52,847 --> 01:48:54,201
The new medicine worked

1472
01:48:54,608 --> 01:48:57,327
Is this your family tradition -

1473
01:48:58,087 --> 01:49:01,328
As one male gets up,
the other conks out?

1474
01:49:01,328 --> 01:49:02,920
Come, wake up

1475
01:49:03,768 --> 01:49:05,121
Your dad wants Pia's scooter

1476
01:49:05,247 --> 01:49:08,922
Should I give it to him?
Hope he won't dent it

1477
01:49:14,688 --> 01:49:18,840
Raju, Farhan is live on webcam.
From the hostel

1478
01:49:21,007 --> 01:49:23,726
Look, Virus has canceled
your suspension order

1479
01:49:24,047 --> 01:49:26,198
Problem solved... Wake up now

1480
01:49:26,488 --> 01:49:29,127
Everything's resolved;
You hear that?

1481
01:49:29,488 --> 01:49:32,207
Rise and shine, buddy

1482
01:49:33,728 --> 01:49:36,800
In this journey of few strides

1483
01:49:37,007 --> 01:49:39,841
On the path called life

1484
01:49:40,047 --> 01:49:45,645
Don't quit...
Just celebrate the ride

1485
01:49:46,408 --> 01:49:49,444
Listen please to those
who love you

1486
01:49:49,568 --> 01:49:52,479
Every dark night is
followed by sunrise

1487
01:49:52,807 --> 01:49:57,836
Don't shut out those
who love you

1488
01:49:58,047 --> 01:50:04,283
We won't let go of you

1489
01:50:04,408 --> 01:50:10,483
We're not done yet... no way

1490
01:50:10,688 --> 01:50:16,842
We won't let go of you

1491
01:50:16,967 --> 01:50:24,238
We're not done yet... no way

1492
01:50:27,448 --> 01:50:31,157
Look, mom bought a new saree
- Brand new

1493
01:50:31,287 --> 01:50:32,845
It cost 2000 /-

1494
01:50:33,488 --> 01:50:34,681
Wake up now

1495
01:50:35,807 --> 01:50:37,844
She bought not one,
but ten sarees

1496
01:50:38,287 --> 01:50:39,163
Look!

1497
01:50:41,167 --> 01:50:42,237
Hey Raju;

1498
01:50:42,287 --> 01:50:45,199
C'mon tell me... How do I look?

1499
01:50:46,247 --> 01:50:49,206
Remember the letters
mom would write...

1500
01:50:49,328 --> 01:50:52,319
Always blessed you
with eternal life

1501
01:50:52,488 --> 01:50:58,358
Don't die on her... you can 't die

1502
01:50:58,728 --> 01:51:01,800
Look at us now, don't turn away

1503
01:51:01,927 --> 01:51:04,920
Smile once to show you care

1504
01:51:05,087 --> 01:51:13,324
Wake up,
don't torment us anymore

1505
01:51:17,207 --> 01:51:21,201
Did you hear about your sis?

1506
01:51:22,087 --> 01:51:24,681
She's getting married

1507
01:51:25,648 --> 01:51:26,921
Without any dowry

1508
01:51:27,568 --> 01:51:32,278
The bridegroom wants
nothing at all

1509
01:51:32,488 --> 01:51:35,844
He just wants Kammo

1510
01:51:36,448 --> 01:51:40,440
You know who the bridegroom is?
- Yeah

1511
01:51:40,488 --> 01:51:41,318
Guess;

1512
01:51:41,368 --> 01:51:43,198
You know him very well
- Yes

1513
01:51:43,368 --> 01:51:44,960
He loves animals
- Huh...?

1514
01:51:45,127 --> 01:51:47,688
He's going to be a
wildlife photographer

1515
01:51:47,768 --> 01:51:49,280
Quiet... Shhhh...

1516
01:51:49,368 --> 01:51:52,404
Didn't get it? It's our Farhan

1517
01:51:53,328 --> 01:51:57,287
Farhan will never take any dowry

1518
01:51:57,847 --> 01:52:02,079
Farhan will marry your sister

1519
01:52:02,488 --> 01:52:06,480
For free; Free! Free;

1520
01:52:10,887 --> 01:52:13,197
Raju

1521
01:52:16,207 --> 01:52:19,837
One kilo okra, 500 grams cheese
for 'free' would've woken him

1522
01:52:20,207 --> 01:52:21,845
Why sacrifice me...!

1523
01:52:22,127 --> 01:52:24,038
Well done, buddy

1524
01:52:24,807 --> 01:52:28,198
So it's all fixed -
Farhan will marry your sister

1525
01:52:29,247 --> 01:52:30,203
Rancho

1526
01:52:32,728 --> 01:52:35,765
Rascals... Stop fibbing

1527
01:52:38,247 --> 01:52:39,237
Lucky escape;

1528
01:52:39,408 --> 01:52:45,563
We won't let go of you

1529
01:52:45,688 --> 01:52:51,842
We're not done yet... no way

1530
01:52:52,047 --> 01:52:58,157
We won't let go of you

1531
01:52:58,328 --> 01:53:04,085
We're not done yet... no way

1532
01:53:04,127 --> 01:53:10,363
We won 't let go of you

1533
01:53:10,688 --> 01:53:12,359
'Okra Rs.12 / kilo'

1534
01:53:21,287 --> 01:53:22,801
You called for a taxi?

1535
01:53:22,847 --> 01:53:24,565
I did
- It's waiting

1536
01:53:24,688 --> 01:53:26,121
Thank you. Why?

1537
01:53:26,528 --> 01:53:27,801
I'm going to the job interview

1538
01:53:28,047 --> 01:53:29,242
You coming with me?

1539
01:53:29,608 --> 01:53:34,045
No. I'm going for the interview.
You're going home

1540
01:53:34,167 --> 01:53:35,487
Why would I go home?

1541
01:53:36,927 --> 01:53:40,238
Remember, we promised
this rascal

1542
01:53:43,448 --> 01:53:45,439
Give me your tie

1543
01:53:46,927 --> 01:53:47,757
Why?

1544
01:53:47,967 --> 01:53:51,721
I doubt you'll go for the
interview after reading this

1545
01:53:52,608 --> 01:53:53,484
What's that?

1546
01:53:53,648 --> 01:53:56,400
A letter
- For you, from Hungary

1547
01:53:56,728 --> 01:53:59,242
Some photographer
called Andre Istvan

1548
01:54:06,847 --> 01:54:08,565
You posted my letter!

1549
01:54:08,728 --> 01:54:10,365
He loved your pictures

1550
01:54:10,807 --> 01:54:13,368
The guy wants you to assist him...

1551
01:54:14,127 --> 01:54:17,518
in the Brazilian rain forest,
for a year

1552
01:54:17,847 --> 01:54:19,405
Will pay you, too

1553
01:54:34,688 --> 01:54:35,916
Dad will never agree

1554
01:54:38,408 --> 01:54:40,967
Go speak to him...
from your heart

1555
01:54:42,568 --> 01:54:43,682
For once, dump your fears...

1556
01:54:44,328 --> 01:54:50,118
or someday, on your deathbed,
you'll regret it

1557
01:54:50,608 --> 01:54:53,076
You'll remember that the letter was
in your hand, taxi at the gate...

1558
01:54:53,207 --> 01:54:56,837
With just a little courage, you
could've turned your life around

1559
01:55:03,127 --> 01:55:05,005
Do you think he'll like it?

1560
01:55:05,608 --> 01:55:07,837
Why such an expensive gift?

1561
01:55:08,927 --> 01:55:11,283
Our son's getting
his first job today

1562
01:55:12,528 --> 01:55:16,282
Don't be stingy at
such a proud moment

1563
01:55:18,127 --> 01:55:19,082
Farhan?

1564
01:55:23,967 --> 01:55:26,162
Don't you have
the job interview today?

1565
01:55:27,847 --> 01:55:28,724
I didn't go

1566
01:55:31,368 --> 01:55:33,039
I don't want to be
an engineer, Dad

1567
01:55:37,087 --> 01:55:38,965
What happened?
You had an accident?

1568
01:55:42,448 --> 01:55:47,475
See that building?
I jumped from its third floor

1569
01:55:50,167 --> 01:55:51,043
Why?

1570
01:55:51,368 --> 01:55:53,597
Because I was rusticated
from college

1571
01:55:56,408 --> 01:55:57,203
Why?

1572
01:55:57,688 --> 01:56:02,318
Drunk, I urinated
on the Director's door

1573
01:56:04,528 --> 01:56:08,042
That scoundrel Rancho
is messing with your mind!

1574
01:56:08,167 --> 01:56:11,762
I don't enjoy Engineering.
I'd make a terrible engineer

1575
01:56:13,807 --> 01:56:18,244
Rancho has a simple belief -
Make your passion your profession

1576
01:56:18,568 --> 01:56:20,081
Then work will become play

1577
01:56:20,207 --> 01:56:22,038
What'll you earn in that jungle?

1578
01:56:22,648 --> 01:56:26,162
A small stipend, but I'll learn a lot

1579
01:56:26,207 --> 01:56:27,356
Five years from now...

1580
01:56:28,047 --> 01:56:32,599
when you see your friends buying
cars and homes, you'll curse yourself

1581
01:56:32,688 --> 01:56:36,521
Life as an engineer will bring
only frustration. Then I'll curse you

1582
01:56:38,488 --> 01:56:40,206
I'd rather curse myself, Dad

1583
01:56:40,328 --> 01:56:41,476
The world will laugh!

1584
01:56:42,688 --> 01:56:44,599
Label you a loser,
for quitting in the final year

1585
01:56:45,448 --> 01:56:50,920
Mr. Kapoor feels you're fortunate
to be at ICE. What'll he think?

1586
01:56:51,167 --> 01:56:53,238
Mr. Kapoor didn't provide me
with an air-conditioner

1587
01:56:55,927 --> 01:56:58,122
It wasn't Mr. Kapoor who slept
in discomfort while I slept well

1588
01:57:00,368 --> 01:57:03,246
He didn't take me around the zoo
on his shoulders

1589
01:57:05,967 --> 01:57:07,162
You did all that, Dad

1590
01:57:09,528 --> 01:57:14,761
How you feel, matters to me.
Mr. Kapoor makes no difference

1591
01:57:15,847 --> 01:57:17,679
I don't even know his first name

1592
01:57:17,807 --> 01:57:20,605
You think you're the hero
of a melodrama?

1593
01:57:20,768 --> 01:57:23,407
Enough, please... he's upset

1594
01:57:24,608 --> 01:57:26,962
God forbid, if he did
something crazy like Raju...

1595
01:57:27,167 --> 01:57:28,680
Then the discussion is over

1596
01:57:28,967 --> 01:57:32,596
Don't say a word or
His Lordship will jump off the roof

1597
01:57:35,927 --> 01:57:40,717
No, Dad. I'll never attempt suicide.
I promise

1598
01:57:43,127 --> 01:57:49,840
The Rancho you detest
put this picture in my wallet

1599
01:57:51,368 --> 01:57:55,042
Told me to see it if a suicidal thought
crossed my mind

1600
01:57:55,167 --> 01:57:58,319
and imagine what'd happen
to your smiles

1601
01:57:58,368 --> 01:58:00,086
when you see my dead body

1602
01:58:05,408 --> 01:58:09,037
I want to convince you, Dad

1603
01:58:10,448 --> 01:58:12,802
but not with a suicide threat

1604
01:58:16,408 --> 01:58:20,082
Dad, what'll happen
if I become a photographer?

1605
01:58:20,368 --> 01:58:21,561
I'll earn less

1606
01:58:22,448 --> 01:58:24,086
I'll have a smaller house,
a smaller car

1607
01:58:26,047 --> 01:58:27,527
But I'll be happy

1608
01:58:29,127 --> 01:58:30,355
I will be really happy

1609
01:58:31,608 --> 01:58:33,199
Whatever I do for you
will be out of genuine love

1610
01:58:35,047 --> 01:58:36,720
I've always listened to you

1611
01:58:37,087 --> 01:58:40,079
For once,
let me listen to my heart

1612
01:58:42,087 --> 01:58:42,963
Please... Dad

1613
01:58:49,127 --> 01:58:50,037
Dad...

1614
01:58:51,207 --> 01:58:52,402
Please don't go away...

1615
01:58:58,368 --> 01:58:59,516
Return this

1616
01:59:02,847 --> 01:59:05,237
Son, what's the cost
of a professional camera?

1617
01:59:06,448 --> 01:59:08,166
Can the laptop be exchanged for it?

1618
01:59:09,568 --> 01:59:11,364
If you need more money, just ask

1619
01:59:19,807 --> 01:59:21,685
Go live your life, my son

1620
01:59:24,488 --> 01:59:28,605
Your grades are consistently poor.
Reason?

1621
01:59:29,247 --> 01:59:30,078
Fear

1622
01:59:31,127 --> 01:59:32,480
I was a good student
since childhood

1623
01:59:33,207 --> 01:59:35,278
Parents hoped
I'd end their poverty

1624
01:59:37,127 --> 01:59:38,082
That scared me

1625
01:59:39,528 --> 01:59:42,837
Here I saw the mad race.
You don't count if you're not first

1626
01:59:44,528 --> 01:59:45,516
My fear grew

1627
01:59:47,127 --> 01:59:48,527
Fear is not good for grades, sir

1628
01:59:49,127 --> 01:59:51,436
I slipped on more
charms and rings

1629
01:59:52,408 --> 01:59:56,685
Prayed to God for favors.
No... begged for favors

1630
01:59:59,648 --> 02:00:02,640
16 broken bones gave me
two months to think and reflect

1631
02:00:03,167 --> 02:00:04,362
Finally, sense dawned

1632
02:00:05,807 --> 02:00:10,756
Today I didn't beg God for this job,
just thanked him for this life

1633
02:00:13,127 --> 02:00:16,962
If you reject me, no regrets

1634
02:00:17,287 --> 02:00:21,247
I'll still do something
worthwhile with my life

1635
02:00:21,768 --> 02:00:26,761
Such frank behavior
is not good for our firm

1636
02:00:27,328 --> 02:00:31,445
We need someone diplomatic
to handle clients

1637
02:00:31,528 --> 02:00:33,802
You're too straightforward

1638
02:00:35,608 --> 02:00:36,404
But...

1639
02:00:37,528 --> 02:00:43,716
if you assure us
you'll control this attitude

1640
02:00:43,847 --> 02:00:46,725
we may consider you

1641
02:00:49,927 --> 02:00:52,965
It took two broken legs
to get me up on my feet

1642
02:00:54,768 --> 02:00:56,520
Wasn't easy to get this attitude

1643
02:00:57,207 --> 02:00:58,037
Can't change it, sir

1644
02:01:01,568 --> 02:01:06,595
You keep your job...
I'll keep my attitude

1645
02:01:06,728 --> 02:01:08,046
I'm sorry, no offense, sir

1646
02:01:12,247 --> 02:01:13,078
Wait

1647
02:01:14,967 --> 02:01:18,801
I've interviewed countless
candidates for 25 years

1648
02:01:19,207 --> 02:01:21,961
Everyone turns into
a yes-man to get the job

1649
02:01:22,127 --> 02:01:23,447
Where did you spring from, son?

1650
02:01:25,287 --> 02:01:26,083
Sir?

1651
02:01:26,328 --> 02:01:28,841
Shall we discuss the salary?

1652
02:01:36,087 --> 02:01:36,963
Thank you, sir

1653
02:02:08,207 --> 02:02:12,247
Your Majesty, thou art great

1654
02:02:14,087 --> 02:02:15,680
Accept this humble offering

1655
02:02:50,807 --> 02:02:54,118
Govind!

1656
02:02:56,087 --> 02:02:59,444
You had said, 'If he gets a job,
shave it off'

1657
02:03:06,368 --> 02:03:07,356
What have you done?

1658
02:03:10,807 --> 02:03:14,083
I feel naked without
my moustache

1659
02:03:16,287 --> 02:03:18,118
I've lost my dignity

1660
02:03:20,127 --> 02:03:22,483
I won't accept defeat, Rastogi

1661
02:03:23,728 --> 02:03:27,606
The job isn't yours until you
pass your final exam

1662
02:03:29,007 --> 02:03:32,796
And this time,
I will set the question paper

1663
02:03:35,847 --> 02:03:38,362
Dad, that's not fair

1664
02:03:40,608 --> 02:03:43,997
Everything is fair in
Love and War

1665
02:03:44,488 --> 02:03:47,685
And this is World War... III

1666
02:03:49,087 --> 02:03:50,077
Rastogi, you're dead meat;

1667
02:03:54,847 --> 02:03:55,724
Hey

1668
02:03:58,047 --> 02:03:58,923
What're you doing here?

1669
02:04:01,768 --> 02:04:02,597
Be careful

1670
02:04:08,047 --> 02:04:11,756
You've been drinking
- Yup, had to down a couple

1671
02:04:12,287 --> 02:04:14,404
A couple too many;

1672
02:04:14,488 --> 02:04:16,319
Needed the guts
- For what?

1673
02:04:18,007 --> 02:04:19,487
For stealing this
- What's this?

1674
02:04:20,528 --> 02:04:24,520
The duplicate key to
Virus's office

1675
02:04:26,927 --> 02:04:29,158
The question paper's
in a cover with a red seal

1676
02:04:29,807 --> 02:04:33,641
Dad has set it, to fail Raju

1677
02:04:33,927 --> 02:04:34,837
Go get it;

1678
02:04:35,847 --> 02:04:38,315
Are you mad or what -
that's cheating;

1679
02:04:42,608 --> 02:04:45,725
Everything's fair in
Love and War

1680
02:04:47,167 --> 02:04:48,157
Tell me something...

1681
02:04:50,007 --> 02:04:51,157
Do you really feel...

1682
02:04:52,648 --> 02:04:57,961
the noses collide while kissing?

1683
02:05:03,167 --> 02:05:06,762
Wait. Have some dhokla

1684
02:05:09,127 --> 02:05:11,641
You Gujaratis are so cute

1685
02:05:12,528 --> 02:05:15,725
But why does your food
sound so dangerous?

1686
02:05:16,768 --> 02:05:21,796
Dhokla, Fafda, Handwa,
Thepla, Khakhra

1687
02:05:22,847 --> 02:05:24,917
Sound like missiles

1688
02:05:24,967 --> 02:05:25,797
C'mon

1689
02:05:26,007 --> 02:05:28,396
'Today Bush dropped
two Dhoklas on Iraq'

1690
02:05:29,007 --> 02:05:31,761
'400 dead, 200 injured'

1691
02:05:32,087 --> 02:05:32,963
C'mon

1692
02:05:36,287 --> 02:05:37,243
Oh...

1693
02:05:38,688 --> 02:05:42,966
I can deal with Khakhra, Fafda.
But your name...

1694
02:05:43,847 --> 02:05:47,045
'Ranchhoddas Shamaldas
Chanchad': Yuck

1695
02:05:48,207 --> 02:05:50,676
I won't change my last name
after marriage

1696
02:05:52,448 --> 02:05:55,326
Pia, we can't get married

1697
02:05:58,728 --> 02:05:59,604
Why?

1698
02:06:00,408 --> 02:06:01,806
Is there someone else?

1699
02:06:04,207 --> 02:06:05,037
No

1700
02:06:05,328 --> 02:06:07,000
Are you gay?
- No

1701
02:06:08,768 --> 02:06:10,599
Then why don't you
propose to me?

1702
02:06:14,967 --> 02:06:16,367
Are you impotent?
- No

1703
02:06:18,927 --> 02:06:20,680
Then prove it

1704
02:06:21,127 --> 02:06:22,037
Pia, no

1705
02:06:22,287 --> 02:06:23,686
Stop, stop;

1706
02:06:23,847 --> 02:06:26,122
What happened?
- We didn't inform Pia

1707
02:06:26,568 --> 02:06:28,559
Stop here,
my bladders are bursting

1708
02:06:28,608 --> 02:06:30,404
Shut up!
- Are you in touch with her?

1709
02:06:30,688 --> 02:06:33,725
No... I have her home number
Then call her, I'll stop

1710
02:06:39,927 --> 02:06:40,724
Hello

1711
02:06:40,807 --> 02:06:42,957
No place for urine-expulsion
in this country

1712
02:06:43,007 --> 02:06:46,283
Hello, is Pia there?
- No, she's not

1713
02:06:46,648 --> 02:06:48,365
Is she at the hospital?

1714
02:06:48,488 --> 02:06:50,001
Why would she be there?

1715
02:06:50,207 --> 02:06:52,323
She's getting married today -
in Manali

1716
02:07:00,007 --> 02:07:01,202
Too late! She's married

1717
02:07:02,568 --> 02:07:05,365
Not yet. It's a six hour drive

1718
02:07:05,688 --> 02:07:07,679
If we rush, we'll reach
before the vows

1719
02:07:08,167 --> 02:07:08,997
What do you say?

1720
02:07:10,847 --> 02:07:13,203
It's a no-brainer. Let's turn back

1721
02:07:13,408 --> 02:07:15,079
No turning back

1722
02:07:15,528 --> 02:07:18,167
Straight to Ladakh.
We'll meet Rancho and return

1723
02:07:18,328 --> 02:07:20,796
I have a Friday meeting with
Phunsukh Wangdu

1724
02:07:20,927 --> 02:07:22,407
Get into the car

1725
02:07:22,608 --> 02:07:25,485
If I miss my meeting,
the Japanese will get him

1726
02:07:25,688 --> 02:07:28,645
They're offering him a
first name in the company

1727
02:07:28,768 --> 02:07:30,962
'Phunsukh and Fujiyashi',
profit sharing...

1728
02:08:03,247 --> 02:08:05,318
Pia weds Suhas;
- Thanks for the suit

1729
02:08:07,568 --> 02:08:09,001
Virus will have a heart attack

1730
02:08:10,047 --> 02:08:12,641
At every daughter's wedding,
we're there to rock the party

1731
02:08:14,007 --> 02:08:17,283
Listen, I'll update Pia,
you peel off the price tag

1732
02:08:33,408 --> 02:08:35,557
Farhan
- We found Rancho

1733
02:08:43,368 --> 02:08:44,926
For Room 107?
- Yes, sir

1734
02:08:45,608 --> 02:08:48,327
You've taken ages
- Sorry, sir

1735
02:08:48,448 --> 02:08:49,278
Off, now

1736
02:08:57,967 --> 02:08:59,605
Housekeeping, sir
- Come in

1737
02:09:00,127 --> 02:09:02,641
Amore... Amore...

1738
02:09:02,728 --> 02:09:04,046
Quick, iron my coat

1739
02:09:04,127 --> 02:09:06,846
Amore... Amore...

1740
02:09:07,688 --> 02:09:10,805
We found Rancho!
Now you can't marry this ass

1741
02:09:11,287 --> 02:09:12,323
You're mad, Farhan

1742
02:09:13,408 --> 02:09:15,967
Don't fool yourself, Pia.
You still love Rancho

1743
02:09:16,167 --> 02:09:18,045
You're still eating his favorite food

1744
02:09:18,328 --> 02:09:20,841
Amore... Amore...

1745
02:09:35,648 --> 02:09:39,686
He's incorrigible.
Once a price tag, always a price tag

1746
02:09:39,768 --> 02:09:42,520
Shut up, Farhan.
Suhas is a changed man

1747
02:09:43,047 --> 02:09:44,958
He doesn't speak of
brands and prices anymore

1748
02:09:45,007 --> 02:09:48,079
My 150,000/: coat

1749
02:09:48,167 --> 02:09:50,203
Why do you people eat sauce?

1750
02:09:50,247 --> 02:09:52,636
I'll sort it out, sir
- How?

1751
02:09:52,728 --> 02:09:55,195
Our laundry specializes in
cleaning mint-stained suits

1752
02:09:55,328 --> 02:09:57,238
I'll clean it in a jiffy

1753
02:10:02,328 --> 02:10:03,601
Get it soon

1754
02:10:04,528 --> 02:10:06,677
But it's too late now, Farhan
- Pia

1755
02:10:07,528 --> 02:10:09,677
Let's go, Pia, we're late

1756
02:10:20,648 --> 02:10:23,845
Pia, it's me... Raju.
Don't yell, they'll kill me

1757
02:10:28,807 --> 02:10:29,684
Where is Suhas?

1758
02:10:29,728 --> 02:10:32,367
Housekeeping took my coat

1759
02:10:32,807 --> 02:10:34,525
Go... Send Suhas here

1760
02:10:34,728 --> 02:10:37,800
It's rude to leave the ceremony

1761
02:10:48,648 --> 02:10:50,239
Yeah, Farhan?
- The car's ready

1762
02:10:50,568 --> 02:10:53,082
Grab her hand and run.
Don't move

1763
02:10:54,528 --> 02:10:56,086
Sir...
- My coat?

1764
02:10:56,127 --> 02:10:57,247
You're here...

1765
02:10:57,247 --> 02:10:58,966
So who's at the altar?
- Altar?

1766
02:11:01,167 --> 02:11:03,556
Another couple of rounds,
and we'll be considered married

1767
02:11:03,728 --> 02:11:05,922
I'm already married, Pia.
Let's go

1768
02:11:06,368 --> 02:11:09,519
It's too late.
People will laugh at me

1769
02:11:09,768 --> 02:11:11,485
So you'll commit suicide?

1770
02:11:12,047 --> 02:11:12,923
Rastogi;

1771
02:11:13,007 --> 02:11:15,043
People will gossip briefly,
then forget

1772
02:11:16,368 --> 02:11:19,328
But you... you'll regret
on your deathbed

1773
02:11:19,328 --> 02:11:22,161
that the car was at the gate,
Rancho within reach...

1774
02:11:22,328 --> 02:11:25,684
but in fear of people,
you married this ass

1775
02:11:27,768 --> 02:11:28,677
Housekeeping?

1776
02:12:06,807 --> 02:12:09,720
Pia, minor problem

1777
02:12:10,007 --> 02:12:10,837
What?

1778
02:12:11,247 --> 02:12:12,805
We don't know if Rancho's married

1779
02:12:12,847 --> 02:12:13,677
What;

1780
02:12:13,768 --> 02:12:16,328
He won't be married
- And if he is?

1781
02:12:17,167 --> 02:12:18,520
Then we'll drop you back

1782
02:12:19,368 --> 02:12:22,997
Relax! Handmade biscuit?

1783
02:12:26,688 --> 02:12:27,518
What's he doing here?

1784
02:12:28,528 --> 02:12:31,804
Ignore him
- The biscuit's very good

1785
02:12:32,807 --> 02:12:34,604
Till yesterday,
I was a law-abiding citizen

1786
02:12:35,087 --> 02:12:38,796
But in the last 24 hours,
I'd grounded an aircraft

1787
02:12:39,568 --> 02:12:41,922
almost assigned Shamaldas's
ashes to the sewers, and

1788
02:12:42,167 --> 02:12:46,399
made a bride elope from her
own wedding! All for Rancho

1789
02:12:47,807 --> 02:12:49,844
But he too would do
anything for friends

1790
02:12:50,087 --> 02:12:53,444
Like stealing the question paper...
from the lion's den

1791
02:12:53,528 --> 02:12:54,516
Envelope with the red seal

1792
02:12:55,488 --> 02:13:00,278
He feared that if Raju failed,
there'd be another high jump

1793
02:13:03,328 --> 02:13:08,402
We were principled thieves,
stealing the paper only for Raju

1794
02:13:08,768 --> 02:13:09,837
We'd sworn we won't even
take a peek

1795
02:13:12,448 --> 02:13:13,721
Where's it hidden...

1796
02:13:13,847 --> 02:13:17,363
We'll grow old searching;
Ask Pia

1797
02:13:23,328 --> 02:13:24,443
Pia, your phone

1798
02:13:25,648 --> 02:13:28,765
Mr. Papa-To-Be;
If you say 'All is well', he kicks

1799
02:13:28,847 --> 02:13:29,644
He kicked

1800
02:13:32,007 --> 02:13:33,440
Pia, your phone

1801
02:13:39,047 --> 02:13:40,242
Found it! Rancho

1802
02:13:41,648 --> 02:13:42,603
Hello?

1803
02:14:00,287 --> 02:14:02,438
Quick, photocopy this

1804
02:14:22,768 --> 02:14:23,518
Where was it?

1805
02:14:23,807 --> 02:14:24,762
Put it back

1806
02:14:47,167 --> 02:14:49,123
We're safe!
- Where were you?

1807
02:14:53,528 --> 02:14:55,166
Here
- What's this?

1808
02:14:55,488 --> 02:14:56,363
A gift

1809
02:14:57,448 --> 02:15:01,202
Question paper.
Virus set it himself, to fail you

1810
02:15:08,488 --> 02:15:09,761
Strange buddies;

1811
02:15:11,047 --> 02:15:15,439
First teach you to be upright,
then offer a path to shame

1812
02:15:17,408 --> 02:15:18,396
No way

1813
02:15:19,927 --> 02:15:21,247
If I pass,
it'll be on my own steam

1814
02:15:24,967 --> 02:15:26,082
If I don't, it's still ok

1815
02:15:42,608 --> 02:15:46,965
He'd won us over!
I felt like embracing him as family...

1816
02:15:47,847 --> 02:15:49,679
but then I controlled my emotions

1817
02:16:08,007 --> 02:16:10,841
Damn thief
- Sir, please, sir

1818
02:16:11,007 --> 02:16:14,079
Rascal
- Sorry sir

1819
02:16:14,608 --> 02:16:15,836
Wanted to change the system

1820
02:16:17,488 --> 02:16:22,243
You'll pee on my door
- Sir, what're you doing

1821
02:16:23,688 --> 02:16:24,643
Sorry sir

1822
02:16:26,047 --> 02:16:27,845
You are rusticated!

1823
02:16:28,608 --> 02:16:31,485
If all of you aren't out by morning,
I'll call the police

1824
02:16:31,847 --> 02:16:33,166
I will call the police;

1825
02:16:35,567 --> 02:16:36,363
Rascals;

1826
02:16:36,688 --> 02:16:37,961
Rascals, all of you

1827
02:16:41,808 --> 02:16:44,038
How did he get my office key?

1828
02:16:45,288 --> 02:16:46,640
I gave him the key, Dad

1829
02:16:47,968 --> 02:16:51,608
I wish I'd given this key to
my brother... He'd be alive today

1830
02:16:51,608 --> 02:16:52,484
Stop it, Pia

1831
02:16:53,567 --> 02:16:56,287
You think your son
fell off a train and died?

1832
02:16:56,808 --> 02:16:57,683
Shut up, Pia

1833
02:16:57,768 --> 02:16:59,962
You decided he'd be an engineer

1834
02:17:00,128 --> 02:17:02,323
Did you ever ask him
what he wanted to be?

1835
02:17:03,087 --> 02:17:04,601
You put such pressure on him...

1836
02:17:04,968 --> 02:17:07,163
that he chose death
over the entrance exam

1837
02:17:11,247 --> 02:17:12,077
I don't understand...

1838
02:17:12,847 --> 02:17:15,316
Dad, you go to your room

1839
02:17:19,048 --> 02:17:21,323
Pia, don't do this

1840
02:17:23,688 --> 02:17:27,441
He wanted to study Literature,
be a writer

1841
02:17:29,608 --> 02:17:31,996
But all he wrote was
this suicide note

1842
02:17:32,048 --> 02:17:33,275
Put that away, please

1843
02:17:33,448 --> 02:17:35,040
No more cover-ups!

1844
02:17:38,288 --> 02:17:41,405
Just once...

1845
02:17:41,448 --> 02:17:44,996
if you'd said: Don't do Engineering
if you don't want to

1846
02:17:45,808 --> 02:17:47,161
just do what your heart is in

1847
02:17:48,567 --> 02:17:50,239
then he'd be alive today

1848
02:17:57,847 --> 02:17:59,838
He didn't commit suicide

1849
02:18:00,528 --> 02:18:01,483
You're right, Dad

1850
02:18:02,968 --> 02:18:04,162
It wasn't suicide...

1851
02:18:06,528 --> 02:18:07,563
It was murder

1852
02:18:22,847 --> 02:18:25,601
Many city roads are
completely submerged

1853
02:18:25,647 --> 02:18:27,558
Traffic has come to a standstill

1854
02:18:40,927 --> 02:18:44,602
Dad...

1855
02:18:45,647 --> 02:18:46,558
Mona?

1856
02:18:50,567 --> 02:18:52,957
Go back, Millimeter.
Why're you following us?

1857
02:18:53,487 --> 02:18:55,683
Why?
Your pop owns the road?

1858
02:18:55,808 --> 02:18:57,445
Please help,
we are desperate here;

1859
02:18:58,368 --> 02:19:00,165
You can't send an ambulance?

1860
02:19:01,128 --> 02:19:02,959
Get it from another hospital

1861
02:19:03,567 --> 02:19:06,958
The entire city's flooded, sir.
We're helpless

1862
02:19:10,327 --> 02:19:11,556
Mona, you ok?

1863
02:19:12,087 --> 02:19:13,042
Rancho, Pia

1864
02:19:15,327 --> 02:19:19,037
Rancho, you can't reach here.
Do as I say

1865
02:19:19,327 --> 02:19:24,004
The water bag has burst

1866
02:19:24,968 --> 02:19:27,402
Disconnected! Mona

1867
02:19:32,407 --> 02:19:33,362
Mona!

1868
02:19:37,567 --> 02:19:39,047
Turn on the lights
- Where to?

1869
02:19:39,528 --> 02:19:43,316
To the table tennis table
- Pia, we're in the common room

1870
02:19:47,128 --> 02:19:48,924
Raju, turn on the web camera

1871
02:19:54,808 --> 02:19:55,923
Where's Mona? Show me

1872
02:19:57,407 --> 02:19:58,317
Hold on

1873
02:20:00,448 --> 02:20:01,278
Here, Pia

1874
02:20:01,567 --> 02:20:04,365
Mona, don't worry. I'm with you

1875
02:20:04,448 --> 02:20:05,403
Pia, I'm dying!

1876
02:20:05,768 --> 02:20:08,281
Rancho, even when
there were no hospitals or docs

1877
02:20:08,407 --> 02:20:09,761
babies were delivered

1878
02:20:10,327 --> 02:20:12,558
You all will deliver this baby

1879
02:20:15,128 --> 02:20:16,640
All is well

1880
02:20:16,768 --> 02:20:19,646
How dare you? I'll kill you

1881
02:20:19,768 --> 02:20:21,724
Dad, stay out of this

1882
02:20:22,647 --> 02:20:24,718
Farhan, get towels and scissors

1883
02:20:24,768 --> 02:20:27,156
Millimeter, get clothes clips
and hot water

1884
02:20:27,407 --> 02:20:28,841
Rancho, cover Mona

1885
02:20:36,087 --> 02:20:37,566
Mona, try pushing

1886
02:20:37,968 --> 02:20:41,755
Push with all your might

1887
02:20:42,007 --> 02:20:44,316
Stop it! I can't do it

1888
02:20:44,528 --> 02:20:46,280
Rancho, check if there's crowning

1889
02:20:47,167 --> 02:20:47,997
Crowning...?

1890
02:20:49,288 --> 02:20:50,164
Get that diagram

1891
02:20:52,968 --> 02:20:55,606
See if the head is coming out

1892
02:20:57,847 --> 02:20:59,121
Check quickly

1893
02:20:59,847 --> 02:21:00,757
Go;

1894
02:21:01,407 --> 02:21:03,797
Go, Rancho, go

1895
02:21:10,768 --> 02:21:12,804
No crowning

1896
02:21:12,847 --> 02:21:14,679
Mona, please push

1897
02:21:17,247 --> 02:21:18,077
Mona!

1898
02:21:20,968 --> 02:21:22,083
She's tired, Pia

1899
02:21:22,487 --> 02:21:26,037
Wake her! If she won't push,
it's a big problem

1900
02:21:26,368 --> 02:21:29,996
They need a vacuum cup
- Where will they get one?

1901
02:21:30,167 --> 02:21:32,921
What's a vacuum cup?
How is it used?

1902
02:21:33,167 --> 02:21:33,997
I'll show you

1903
02:21:37,128 --> 02:21:41,280
If the mother's too fatigued to push,
a cup is placed on baby's head

1904
02:21:41,567 --> 02:21:45,197
Suction makes the cup
stick to the head...

1905
02:21:45,847 --> 02:21:47,679
and the baby is pulled out

1906
02:21:48,128 --> 02:21:50,244
I can make this
- How?

1907
02:21:50,487 --> 02:21:52,239
With a vacuum cleaner
- Vacuum cleaner?

1908
02:21:52,288 --> 02:21:53,323
Yes

1909
02:21:53,368 --> 02:21:55,643
That pressure's too high

1910
02:21:55,688 --> 02:21:57,757
I'll control it
- D'you have a vacuum cleaner?

1911
02:21:57,808 --> 02:21:58,843
Yes, in my office

1912
02:21:59,247 --> 02:22:01,842
Farhan, rush and get it
- Here's the key

1913
02:22:07,608 --> 02:22:10,917
Mona, push

1914
02:22:11,647 --> 02:22:13,127
Oh my God

1915
02:22:13,968 --> 02:22:14,843
What happened?

1916
02:22:19,528 --> 02:22:21,722
Raju, what happened?
- The power's gone

1917
02:22:22,647 --> 02:22:24,047
How'll the vacuum work now?

1918
02:22:24,087 --> 02:22:26,556
Farhan, you get the vacuum,
I'll get the power.

1919
02:22:26,608 --> 02:22:27,563
How?

1920
02:22:28,208 --> 02:22:29,640
Millimeter, get Virus out

1921
02:22:30,968 --> 02:22:33,528
What nonsense is this!

1922
02:22:33,727 --> 02:22:37,164
Not this Virus.
My Virus, the inverter

1923
02:22:37,327 --> 02:22:39,158
Get that, quick
- Ok

1924
02:22:39,407 --> 02:22:41,477
Raju, wake up the hostel

1925
02:22:41,647 --> 02:22:44,480
Get car batteries, wires,
and a vacuum gauge

1926
02:22:47,208 --> 02:22:49,768
Emergency in the common room!

1927
02:23:19,327 --> 02:23:21,363
Where's Rancho?
- Here, sir

1928
02:23:21,608 --> 02:23:24,201
Keep the batteries here
...and the wires

1929
02:23:26,368 --> 02:23:29,440
Raju, switch off everything,
connect the inverter to the mains

1930
02:23:34,048 --> 02:23:35,197
Rancho, vacuum cleaner

1931
02:23:36,288 --> 02:23:39,085
Farhan, get your lens cleaner

1932
02:23:39,128 --> 02:23:40,527
Blower?
- Yeah, get it

1933
02:23:43,128 --> 02:23:44,117
Rancho, blower

1934
02:23:44,247 --> 02:23:46,203
Good. Fix this to the gauge

1935
02:24:11,528 --> 02:24:12,755
Rancho, I'm done

1936
02:24:15,087 --> 02:24:16,202
All switches off?
- Yes

1937
02:24:17,688 --> 02:24:19,245
Hit the table
and computer switches

1938
02:24:19,288 --> 02:24:20,118
Ok

1939
02:24:32,288 --> 02:24:33,356
Raju, turn on the computer

1940
02:24:33,727 --> 02:24:35,365
Farhan, here

1941
02:24:37,368 --> 02:24:39,324
Pia, come here quick

1942
02:24:41,688 --> 02:24:42,756
Love you, Rancho

1943
02:24:43,487 --> 02:24:45,398
Farhan, turn it on
- Ok

1944
02:24:51,688 --> 02:24:53,644
Pia, how much suction?

1945
02:24:54,007 --> 02:24:55,406
Not more than 0.5

1946
02:24:55,608 --> 02:24:57,564
Farhan, 0.5
- Cover it

1947
02:24:59,048 --> 02:24:59,924
0.5

1948
02:25:02,368 --> 02:25:06,246
Vacuum cleaner baby!
Mother of all deliveries

1949
02:25:07,288 --> 02:25:08,084
Farhan, stop

1950
02:25:08,128 --> 02:25:08,924
Ok

1951
02:25:15,167 --> 02:25:16,361
Raju, get on the table

1952
02:25:16,608 --> 02:25:19,645
Push the baby down, like this

1953
02:25:19,808 --> 02:25:20,718
Ok

1954
02:25:21,768 --> 02:25:22,644
Farhan, turn it on

1955
02:25:27,048 --> 02:25:29,278
C'mon, you can do it

1956
02:25:30,368 --> 02:25:32,722
C'mon, push

1957
02:25:36,727 --> 02:25:39,195
Do it for Champ

1958
02:25:39,407 --> 02:25:41,763
C'mon, Mona

1959
02:25:43,407 --> 02:25:45,398
He's coming out;

1960
02:25:46,688 --> 02:25:48,406
You can do it

1961
02:25:49,167 --> 02:25:51,442
Yes Mona, push

1962
02:25:58,968 --> 02:26:00,003
Farhan, turn it off

1963
02:26:00,087 --> 02:26:01,076
Ok, off

1964
02:26:20,528 --> 02:26:22,245
Two clips,
cut the umbilical cord

1965
02:26:22,528 --> 02:26:24,644
Farhan, two clips on the cord

1966
02:26:25,327 --> 02:26:27,283
Get scissors
- Be careful

1967
02:26:28,448 --> 02:26:30,643
Cut at the center,
get a towel

1968
02:26:33,327 --> 02:26:35,558
Pia, he's not crying

1969
02:26:39,647 --> 02:26:42,445
Hey Champ!

1970
02:26:43,727 --> 02:26:46,083
Rancho, rub his back

1971
02:26:48,247 --> 02:26:50,203
Hey Champ
- Come on, Champ

1972
02:26:51,968 --> 02:26:54,004
No, nothing

1973
02:26:54,448 --> 02:26:55,436
Blow air into his mouth

1974
02:27:02,327 --> 02:27:03,123
C'mon, Champ

1975
02:27:08,448 --> 02:27:09,278
No response

1976
02:27:32,647 --> 02:27:36,118
Hush Mona, say -
All is well

1977
02:27:41,167 --> 02:27:42,077
He kicked

1978
02:27:43,327 --> 02:27:44,157
What?

1979
02:27:45,007 --> 02:27:46,236
He kicked

1980
02:27:49,567 --> 02:27:50,842
Say: All is well

1981
02:27:51,727 --> 02:27:59,042
All is well

1982
02:28:38,808 --> 02:28:42,039
If Virus had said, 'My grandson
will be an engineer'

1983
02:28:42,167 --> 02:28:43,965
I would've broken his jaw

1984
02:28:44,608 --> 02:28:47,326
But when he finally spoke,
he stunned us

1985
02:28:47,608 --> 02:28:50,645
What a kick!
Wanna be a footballer?

1986
02:28:51,647 --> 02:28:54,559
Be what you want to be

1987
02:29:10,368 --> 02:29:14,121
Wait: I've not finished with you!

1988
02:29:16,407 --> 02:29:18,842
First day of college,
you'd asked me a question...

1989
02:29:19,208 --> 02:29:21,516
Why didn't astronauts
use a pencil in space?

1990
02:29:22,247 --> 02:29:24,442
If a pencil tip breaks

1991
02:29:24,608 --> 02:29:30,284
it'd float in zero gravity.
Get into eyes, nose, instruments...

1992
02:29:30,407 --> 02:29:32,284
You were wrong

1993
02:29:33,808 --> 02:29:35,604
You cannot be right all the time

1994
02:29:37,608 --> 02:29:38,596
You understand?

1995
02:29:40,927 --> 02:29:41,757
Yes, sir

1996
02:29:42,968 --> 02:29:45,004
This was an important invention

1997
02:29:46,247 --> 02:29:47,236
You understand?

1998
02:29:48,567 --> 02:29:49,397
Yes, sir

1999
02:29:51,768 --> 02:30:00,675
My Director said, 'When you find
an extraordinary student...'

2000
02:30:18,007 --> 02:30:22,286
Go, study;
Pass your exams and leave

2001
02:30:30,808 --> 02:30:32,843
And now, Student of the Year...

2002
02:30:33,048 --> 02:30:35,436
Ranchhoddas Shamaldas Chanchad

2003
02:30:52,368 --> 02:30:53,641
Sir, one photo

2004
02:31:10,407 --> 02:31:13,718
I wanted to capture all these
memories and take them home

2005
02:31:15,688 --> 02:31:20,842
That day, we hugged,
we rejoiced, we cried...

2006
02:31:21,128 --> 02:31:22,719
We vowed that we'd meet
at least once a year...

2007
02:31:23,368 --> 02:31:26,677
Who knew then, we were seeing
Rancho for the last time

2008
02:31:59,247 --> 02:32:00,157
Untie him

2009
02:32:03,368 --> 02:32:05,199
I'll sue you all in an
American court

2010
02:32:19,087 --> 02:32:19,917
Raju

2011
02:32:38,167 --> 02:32:40,078
Only Rancho can create
a school like this

2012
02:32:40,608 --> 02:32:41,643
But where is he?

2013
02:32:45,927 --> 02:32:47,121
Don't pee here

2014
02:32:48,167 --> 02:32:49,726
Go away creatures

2015
02:32:50,087 --> 02:32:53,046
Don't pee here
- I'll smack you

2016
02:33:10,087 --> 02:33:12,203
Bingo; He cannot be far

2017
02:33:23,208 --> 02:33:25,403
Excuse me,
where is Ranchhoddas?

2018
02:33:25,528 --> 02:33:27,439
He's not Ranchhoddas!
- Rancho...

2019
02:33:27,528 --> 02:33:29,644
Chhote... Dammit,
what's his name?

2020
02:33:29,768 --> 02:33:32,361
Calm down. Come with me

2021
02:33:34,727 --> 02:33:35,603
Where's he?
- Rancho

2022
02:33:42,688 --> 02:33:45,725
Farhan, he's read all your books

2023
02:33:51,768 --> 02:33:57,558
Raju, he reads your blog everyday.
Proudly shares it with the kids

2024
02:34:00,927 --> 02:34:04,283
Remember your helmet, Pia?
It was stolen...

2025
02:34:06,128 --> 02:34:09,200
Who are you?
How do you know us?

2026
02:34:09,448 --> 02:34:11,439
Didn't you recognize me?
- No

2027
02:34:12,327 --> 02:34:16,162
How would you?
Millimeter is now Centimeter

2028
02:34:21,007 --> 02:34:25,319
Not Centimeter, you're Kilometer

2029
02:34:26,128 --> 02:34:27,083
How did you get here?

2030
02:34:27,167 --> 02:34:30,284
I got a letter with
a train ticket inside

2031
02:34:30,528 --> 02:34:34,122
It said: 'Miss being in school?
Catch this train'... I did

2032
02:34:35,647 --> 02:34:36,717
That rascal Rancho;

2033
02:34:40,727 --> 02:34:41,683
Where is that idiot?

2034
02:34:52,407 --> 02:34:54,238
Dorje, you fly it

2035
02:35:08,608 --> 02:35:13,841
Every night you ride into my dreams
on a scooter, dressed as a bride

2036
02:35:14,768 --> 02:35:16,962
Instead of a veil,
you lift your helmet

2037
02:35:17,567 --> 02:35:20,207
and come close to kiss me

2038
02:35:23,647 --> 02:35:24,842
Couldn't you tell me
before leaving?

2039
02:35:27,087 --> 02:35:27,837
No

2040
02:35:29,608 --> 02:35:30,484
Sorry

2041
02:35:30,847 --> 02:35:31,644
Did you marry?

2042
02:35:32,208 --> 02:35:36,281
What? No

2043
02:35:37,208 --> 02:35:39,721
You?
- Almost... Idiot

2044
02:35:47,007 --> 02:35:47,837
So?

2045
02:35:49,247 --> 02:35:50,202
So what?

2046
02:35:50,688 --> 02:35:51,961
Do you love someone?

2047
02:35:56,208 --> 02:35:57,004
Yes

2048
02:36:02,808 --> 02:36:03,638
Who?

2049
02:36:04,847 --> 02:36:05,724
You

2050
02:36:30,407 --> 02:36:33,479
See, the noses don't collide,
stupid

2051
02:36:34,647 --> 02:36:35,443
That's right;

2052
02:36:35,688 --> 02:36:36,756
Rancho

2053
02:36:38,208 --> 02:36:39,038
Hi... Farhan;

2054
02:36:39,208 --> 02:36:41,244
Screw your 'Hi'

2055
02:36:41,647 --> 02:36:46,199
Hey, listen to me...
- No, you listen to me

2056
02:36:46,368 --> 02:36:48,563
I can explain everything

2057
02:36:49,608 --> 02:36:50,438
Hi... Raju;

2058
02:36:53,727 --> 02:36:54,877
How we hunted for you;

2059
02:36:55,087 --> 02:36:59,047
Didn't have a coin
for one phone call?

2060
02:37:01,007 --> 02:37:03,202
Add a couple from me too

2061
02:37:03,727 --> 02:37:08,721
Rascal, scoundrel
- Let him go now

2062
02:37:08,847 --> 02:37:09,757
Ok ok, enough

2063
02:37:11,048 --> 02:37:12,765
On your feet, c'mon

2064
02:37:41,567 --> 02:37:43,239
Having fun, idiots?

2065
02:37:43,487 --> 02:37:45,284
Hey... Hi Chatur

2066
02:37:45,567 --> 02:37:50,436
Ranchhoddas Chanchad.
How do you do, Mr. Teacher?

2067
02:37:50,847 --> 02:37:57,367
Wow, you're a teacher in a village -
A for Apple, B for Ball...

2068
02:37:59,208 --> 02:38:03,759
Our trains left together.
But yours traveled in reverse...

2069
02:38:04,288 --> 02:38:07,085
from engineer to primary teacher

2070
02:38:09,167 --> 02:38:11,966
What's your salary, Chanchad?
5000 /-?

2071
02:38:12,327 --> 02:38:14,046
For me that's $ 100

2072
02:38:14,448 --> 02:38:17,724
My son's pocket money is
more than your salary

2073
02:38:17,847 --> 02:38:20,566
Cut the crap
- Crap is what he gave us

2074
02:38:20,727 --> 02:38:25,596
Wanted to change the education
system, change the world

2075
02:38:25,808 --> 02:38:28,605
Finally what does he change?
Kids' diapers

2076
02:38:28,727 --> 02:38:30,081
You gonna break his jaw
or should I?

2077
02:38:30,247 --> 02:38:31,123
Just relax

2078
02:38:31,208 --> 02:38:37,727
Remember I'd said
one day you'd cry and I'd laugh?

2079
02:38:39,327 --> 02:38:45,846
Sign here.
Accept: You lost, I won!

2080
02:38:46,087 --> 02:38:49,000
'Declaration of Defeat'!
Unbelievable, man

2081
02:38:49,167 --> 02:38:51,158
Chatur
- Crazy guy

2082
02:38:52,847 --> 02:38:57,046
Hey, this is Virus's pen!
You pinched it?

2083
02:38:57,448 --> 02:38:58,800
Forget it, man

2084
02:38:59,448 --> 02:39:02,996
This is for winners, not losers

2085
02:39:04,048 --> 02:39:10,760
If your school ever needs help,
call my assistant for a donation

2086
02:39:12,808 --> 02:39:15,527
A for Apple, B for Ball...

2087
02:39:16,968 --> 02:39:19,640
He hasn't changed at all!
- Ignore him

2088
02:39:19,768 --> 02:39:21,200
He's full of crap

2089
02:39:21,528 --> 02:39:25,760
Good news is your name
isn't Ranchhoddas Chanchad

2090
02:39:26,128 --> 02:39:30,006
Imagine, after marriage,
I'm Pia Chanchad: Yuck;

2091
02:39:30,727 --> 02:39:32,161
By the way,
what is your real name?

2092
02:39:32,968 --> 02:39:33,843
Phunsukh Wangdu

2093
02:39:34,608 --> 02:39:35,484
Wangdu?

2094
02:39:35,647 --> 02:39:36,477
Pia Wangdu!

2095
02:39:37,128 --> 02:39:38,799
You mean you're a scientist?

2096
02:39:39,007 --> 02:39:40,281
You have 400 patents?

2097
02:39:40,407 --> 02:39:42,204
I won't change my name
after marriage

2098
02:39:42,247 --> 02:39:43,806
You mean you're Chatur's
Wangdu?

2099
02:39:43,847 --> 02:39:45,997
It's you the Japanese are wooing?

2100
02:39:46,048 --> 02:39:46,924
I don't like Wangdu

2101
02:39:47,487 --> 02:39:49,603
Are you a scientist
or a teacher?

2102
02:39:50,007 --> 02:39:51,838
Scientist,
but I also teach children

2103
02:39:51,927 --> 02:39:53,963
So you are
TH E Phunsukh Wangdu?

2104
02:39:54,007 --> 02:39:55,122
Yes, yes;

2105
02:39:56,327 --> 02:39:59,126
Hey Silencer
- Hey Chatur, come back

2106
02:40:00,327 --> 02:40:01,397
Take that

2107
02:40:02,847 --> 02:40:05,077
Wait, I'll stop him

2108
02:40:12,647 --> 02:40:16,118
Mr. Wangdu,
I can't believe it's you

2109
02:40:16,608 --> 02:40:17,801
I'm sorry, Mr. Chatur

2110
02:40:17,847 --> 02:40:20,122
I can't sign the deal
with your company

2111
02:40:20,608 --> 02:40:22,564
What sir? Why sir?

2112
02:40:22,768 --> 02:40:25,486
How do I sign, man?
You took my pen

2113
02:40:27,288 --> 02:40:29,199
What pen, sir?
I didn't get you...

2114
02:40:29,528 --> 02:40:33,566
The one in your hand -
Virus's pen

2115
02:40:36,927 --> 02:40:38,361
Mr. Wangdu...?

2116
02:40:38,528 --> 02:40:39,676
Yes, Chatur?

2117
02:40:40,448 --> 02:40:42,359
A for Apple, B for Ball is...

2118
02:40:45,368 --> 02:40:46,959
...S for Screwed

2119
02:40:53,808 --> 02:40:57,766
You got me, Rancho -
I mean, Mr. Wangdu

2120
02:40:58,128 --> 02:40:59,685
Totally floored me. Good one

2121
02:41:00,327 --> 02:41:04,445
I hope our personal problems
won't affect this deal

2122
02:41:04,608 --> 02:41:07,680
Hey Chatur: take that

2123
02:41:08,288 --> 02:41:10,199
I was just joking, man

2124
02:41:10,567 --> 02:41:14,277
Deep down,
I knew you'd do great things

2125
02:41:15,247 --> 02:41:16,966
You're fibbing

2126
02:41:17,048 --> 02:41:18,924
No, really, I swear

2127
02:41:19,007 --> 02:41:20,918
Rancho: 100, Chatur: 0

2128
02:41:21,288 --> 02:41:23,518
You win, I lose.
You don't believe me?

2129
02:41:24,847 --> 02:41:26,200
Beware of farts

2130
02:41:26,247 --> 02:41:30,365
Your Majesty, thou art great.
Accept this humble offering

2131
02:41:30,448 --> 02:41:32,722
Free advice, Mr. Wangdu -
Run for your life;

2132
02:41:36,288 --> 02:41:40,200
Rancho, I'll lose my job, man.
I have small kids...

2133
02:41:41,128 --> 02:41:43,561
His Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas
had correctly stated

2134
02:41:43,768 --> 02:41:48,637
Follow Excellence... Success
will chase you, pants down
