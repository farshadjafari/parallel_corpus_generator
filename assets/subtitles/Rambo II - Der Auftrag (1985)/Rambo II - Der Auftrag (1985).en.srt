1
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,133
Let's keep those hammers working.

2
00:01:00,814 --> 00:01:02,389
Rambo!

3
00:01:05,378 --> 00:01:06,209
Let's go.

4
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:29,741
How are you, Johnny?

5
00:01:31,154 --> 00:01:32,151
Good.

6
00:01:33,977 --> 00:01:34,849
That's all.

7
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,410
John, I'm sorry they sent
you to such a hellhole.

8
00:01:42,245 --> 00:01:43,734
I've seen worse.

9
00:01:43,857 --> 00:01:45,161
Yeah, you have, haven't you...

10
00:01:46,762 --> 00:01:49,149
John, I told you that
I'd help you when I could.

11
00:01:50,088 --> 00:01:51,537
Are you interested?

12
00:01:54,775 --> 00:01:58,404
You can't possibly wanna
stay here for another five years.

13
00:02:05,774 --> 00:02:08,099
In here at least, I know where I stand.

14
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,424
Just hear me out first.

15
00:02:12,084 --> 00:02:14,574
A covert operation is being
geared up in the Far East.

16
00:02:14,614 --> 00:02:16,438
Your name was dug
out of computer as one of

17
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:18,471
three most able to complete the mission.

18
00:02:20,987 --> 00:02:21,761
Mission?

19
00:02:21,762 --> 00:02:23,891
Recon for POWs in Nam.

20
00:02:29,188 --> 00:02:30,970
Why now? Why me?

21
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:36,014
The prison camp you escaped
from in '71 is the target area.

22
00:02:36,618 --> 00:02:38,609
Nobody knows that
terrain better than you do.

23
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,018
The risk factor is very high.

24
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,280
You'd be temporarily
reinstated in the Forces,

25
00:02:43,281 --> 00:02:45,002
and if the mission's successful,

26
00:02:45,042 --> 00:02:47,177
there may be a presidential pardon.

27
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,601
You interested?

28
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,363
Yeah.

29
00:02:59,925 --> 00:03:04,263
Good... good. I'll get
the necessary clearance.

30
00:03:05,466 --> 00:03:07,041
The next time we meet,
it will be in Thailand

31
00:03:07,042 --> 00:03:09,660
with the Special Ops designate
who runs the operation.

32
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:11,030
Yes, Sir.

33
00:03:11,904 --> 00:03:13,251
- All clear?
- Yes.

34
00:03:13,436 --> 00:03:16,863
John, I want you to know that I did
what I could to keep you outta here.

35
00:03:17,256 --> 00:03:18,146
I know.

36
00:03:19,815 --> 00:03:20,650
Yeah.

37
00:03:20,814 --> 00:03:21,699
Sir?

38
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,142
Do we get to win this time?

39
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,904
This time, it's up to you...

40
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:44,577
That'll be all.

41
00:05:46,363 --> 00:05:48,251
How you doin', Rambo? I'm Ericson.

42
00:05:48,668 --> 00:05:50,762
Why don't we make it over to the hangar?

43
00:05:53,544 --> 00:05:55,953
You're the chosen one, huh?

44
00:05:56,452 --> 00:05:59,042
You made a helluva rep'
for yourself in Nam!

45
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,760
Anyway, I'm glad to be workin' with you.

46
00:06:03,176 --> 00:06:06,512
This place may not be heaven,
but at least you're out of the joint!

47
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,200
He's here.

48
00:06:16,854 --> 00:06:18,328
- Morning, John.
- Sir.

49
00:06:18,928 --> 00:06:22,147
This is Marshal Murdock. He's in charge
of Special Operations from Wahington.

50
00:06:22,228 --> 00:06:23,054
Thank you, Colonel.

51
00:06:23,344 --> 00:06:25,217
Rambo, been looking
forward to meeting you.

52
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,779
How was your trip? No problems?

53
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,607
No.

54
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,390
Except for the damned heat, right?

55
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:30,926
Never felt anything like it!

56
00:06:31,383 --> 00:06:33,205
Come on in, let's get down to business!

57
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,978
I was glancing over your files.

58
00:06:39,476 --> 00:06:41,736
Makes some pretty interesting reading!

59
00:06:47,446 --> 00:06:50,395
Rambo, John J., born 7.6.47,

60
00:06:50,501 --> 00:06:52,718
Bowie, Arizona, of
Indian-German descent.

61
00:06:53,134 --> 00:06:54,732
That's a helluva combination!

62
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:56,954
Joined the army 8.6.64,

63
00:06:57,202 --> 00:07:00,115
accepted special forces,
specialization: light weapons.

64
00:07:00,938 --> 00:07:03,269
Cross-trained as medic.
Helicopter and language qualified.

65
00:07:03,345 --> 00:07:07,284
59 confirmed kills, 2 silver
stars, 4 bronze, 4 Purple Hearts,

66
00:07:07,304 --> 00:07:09,947
distinguished service
cross, and Medal of Honor.

67
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:12,575
You got around, didn't ya?

68
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:14,140
Incredible!

69
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,922
Rambo, you're probably aware
that there's almost 2.500 Americans

70
00:07:18,974 --> 00:07:21,093
still Missing In Action
in South-East Asia.

71
00:07:21,277 --> 00:07:22,873
Most of these boys are presumed killed,

72
00:07:22,874 --> 00:07:25,720
but to the legal families,
Congress and lots of Americans,

73
00:07:25,928 --> 00:07:27,939
it's still a very emotional issue.

74
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,808
Gimme something cold, please!

75
00:07:31,845 --> 00:07:34,650
Rambo, you certainly don't know
as much about me as I do you.

76
00:07:35,097 --> 00:07:39,448
I've honched with the 2nd Battalion,
3rd Marines, in Kon Tum in '66.

77
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:43,570
I lost a lot of good men, so I know
what you and every vet feels now.

78
00:07:43,591 --> 00:07:44,914
Maybe the government didn't care,

79
00:07:44,915 --> 00:07:47,907
maybe certain segments of
the population didn't care,

80
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:50,121
but my committee cares.

81
00:07:50,227 --> 00:07:51,305
So what his commitee needs is

82
00:07:51,306 --> 00:07:53,636
exclusive proof that
Americans are being held.

83
00:07:53,675 --> 00:07:55,546
Once done, rest sure we'll get 'em back.

84
00:07:55,961 --> 00:07:58,659
Now, if there's any of our
men at this POW target camp,

85
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:01,254
you'll confirm their presence
by taking photographs.

86
00:08:02,685 --> 00:08:03,636
Photographs?

87
00:08:03,637 --> 00:08:04,530
Just photographs.

88
00:08:04,531 --> 00:08:07,820
Under no circumstances are
you to engage the enemy.

89
00:08:09,707 --> 00:08:11,240
I'm supposed to leave'em there?

90
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,560
I repeat: do not engage the enemy.

91
00:08:15,017 --> 00:08:17,155
Phase 2, Delta Force assault
team led by Colonel Trautman

92
00:08:17,156 --> 00:08:18,356
will handle the extraction.

93
00:08:19,816 --> 00:08:20,859
Okay?

94
00:08:25,436 --> 00:08:27,781
Anyway, I'd just like to say that
I feel with your participation,

95
00:08:27,782 --> 00:08:30,440
this mission has a
better than average chance

96
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,328
to succeed where others have failed.

97
00:08:33,363 --> 00:08:35,897
I'll meet you both in the
operations center in one hour.

98
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:58,271
From Thailand, across Laos, into the
mountains of Vietnam, to the drop zone.

99
00:08:58,728 --> 00:09:01,445
You'll be flying a ceiling of
250 feet when you bail out.

100
00:09:02,298 --> 00:09:03,869
- Think you can handle it?
- I'll try.

101
00:09:05,056 --> 00:09:05,942
Since you're going in solo,

102
00:09:05,943 --> 00:09:09,019
you'll have to rely on more
equipment than you ever used before.

103
00:09:09,746 --> 00:09:10,593
And use it!

104
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:13,513
What I'm sayin' is don't try
the blood-and-guts routine.

105
00:09:14,544 --> 00:09:16,075
Let technology do most of the work.

106
00:09:16,948 --> 00:09:18,688
John, I want you to
try to forget the war.

107
00:09:18,689 --> 00:09:20,220
Remember the mission.

108
00:09:20,534 --> 00:09:21,993
The old Vietnam's dead.

109
00:09:22,387 --> 00:09:25,411
Sir, I'm alive, it's
still alive, ain't it?

110
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:40,529
You may find this hard to
believe, but all this is for you!

111
00:09:40,673 --> 00:09:42,125
Impressed?

112
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,107
Besides modern computer
devices you can see here,

113
00:09:44,145 --> 00:09:46,175
you'll be issued every
other modern piece

114
00:09:46,176 --> 00:09:48,516
of equipment we have
to ensure your safety.

115
00:09:48,869 --> 00:09:51,091
Rambo, you can feel totally
safe because we have the

116
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:53,835
most advanced weapons in
the world available to us.

117
00:09:55,533 --> 00:09:57,816
I've always believed that
the mind's the best weapon.

118
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,371
Times change.

119
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:01,428
For some people.

120
00:10:02,943 --> 00:10:04,147
Don't let me interrupt you, Colonel.

121
00:10:04,685 --> 00:10:07,052
Upon insertion, call in
to base camp on Transat.

122
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,852
Then proceed to Point Hawk September
to rendezvous with the ground contact:

123
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:12,591
indigenous agent Co Bao.

124
00:10:13,218 --> 00:10:14,469
Is he listening?

125
00:10:16,164 --> 00:10:17,860
Indigenous agent Co Bao.

126
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:27,205
Colonel!

127
00:10:28,616 --> 00:10:30,797
Are you sure he's still not
unbalanced from the war?

128
00:10:30,941 --> 00:10:33,097
We can't afford to have him
involved in this mission,

129
00:10:33,098 --> 00:10:34,733
he might crack under
the pressure in that hell!

130
00:10:35,151 --> 00:10:36,194
Pressure?

131
00:10:37,002 --> 00:10:39,763
Let me just say that Rambo is the
best combat vet I've ever seen.

132
00:10:40,053 --> 00:10:44,047
A pure fighting machine with only a
desire to win a war that someone else lost.

133
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,787
If winning means he has to
die, he'll die. No fear, no regrets.

134
00:10:50,154 --> 00:10:52,586
And... one more thing:

135
00:10:53,356 --> 00:10:57,675
What you choose to call
"Hell", he calls home!

136
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,653
Stand by!
Start A.P.U.!

137
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,390
D minus 20.

138
00:12:01,643 --> 00:12:03,013
D minus 5.

139
00:12:18,786 --> 00:12:21,235
You got 36 hours to
get the hell in and out.

140
00:12:21,549 --> 00:12:23,059
So don't stop to smell the roses, okay?

141
00:12:23,268 --> 00:12:24,103
Yeah.

142
00:12:25,056 --> 00:12:26,540
If you run into any
trouble, try to get to the

143
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:29,066
hilltop extraction site
marked on your map.

144
00:12:29,067 --> 00:12:30,471
Ready to roll, Colonel.

145
00:12:36,386 --> 00:12:38,464
- Good luck, son.
- Thanks.

146
00:12:38,544 --> 00:12:39,768
Let's go!

147
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:44,478
Remember Murdock said he'd
been with the 2nd Battalion,

148
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:47,200
third Marines in Kon Tum in '66?

149
00:12:47,618 --> 00:12:48,557
Yeah.

150
00:12:48,591 --> 00:12:50,936
The 2nd Battalion was at Kud Sank.

151
00:12:52,846 --> 00:12:54,714
You're the only one I trust.

152
00:13:37,433 --> 00:13:40,499
- Think he'll find someone?
- POWs? Doubtful.

153
00:13:40,894 --> 00:13:42,655
But there's people to satisfy,

154
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,625
questions that have to be answered.

155
00:13:46,374 --> 00:13:48,243
You don't sound too
emotional about it...

156
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,904
It wasn't my war, Colonel.

157
00:13:50,361 --> 00:13:52,538
I'm just here to clean up the mess!

158
00:14:36,356 --> 00:14:37,849
AWACS two-five has acquired.

159
00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:39,924
They're holding timeline.

160
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,266
Affirmative, Wolf Den. Over.

161
00:15:17,492 --> 00:15:19,485
Back in the badlands, my man!

162
00:15:20,605 --> 00:15:22,308
Stand by your position!

163
00:15:23,327 --> 00:15:25,357
- Insertion in 15 seconds.
- Partytime!

164
00:15:38,848 --> 00:15:39,844
Five seconds!

165
00:15:40,158 --> 00:15:40,992
Four...

166
00:15:41,097 --> 00:15:41,931
Three...

167
00:15:41,932 --> 00:15:42,975
Two...

168
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:44,124
Jumper away.

169
00:15:58,254 --> 00:15:59,295
Shit, what's happening?

170
00:15:59,401 --> 00:16:01,078
A turbulence! He's hung up!

171
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:04,706
He'll be torn apart!

172
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:07,731
Condition Red! He's hung up!

173
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,777
- What do you mean he's hung up?
- What's happening?

174
00:16:09,882 --> 00:16:11,249
He's being dragged!

175
00:16:13,544 --> 00:16:14,587
Lifer cut him loose!

176
00:16:14,592 --> 00:16:16,022
I can't free him!

177
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:38,861
Ericson, abort the mission! Pull out.

178
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,846
That'll kill him! He'll be torn apart!

179
00:16:44,396 --> 00:16:46,096
He's cutting away his equipment.

180
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:58,443
He's out!

181
00:16:59,775 --> 00:17:01,976
Come in here, this is Dragonfly
one. Do you read me, over?

182
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:04,280
Dragonfly one, come in, I read you.

183
00:17:04,632 --> 00:17:08,515
- Any visual bearing by flares?
- Negative. We didn't see anything.

184
00:17:15,964 --> 00:17:17,762
Maybe the smartest thing
to do is to abort the mission

185
00:17:17,763 --> 00:17:19,980
right now before there's
any more complications.

186
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:21,962
I mean who could've
survived something like that?

187
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:23,746
He deserves the benefit of the doubt.

188
00:17:24,203 --> 00:17:26,381
He's got 36 hours to
complete the mission,

189
00:17:26,487 --> 00:17:28,455
and reach the extraction point.

190
00:17:29,225 --> 00:17:31,400
- We owe him that.
- Of course, we do!

191
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:36,691
But understand something
now: in 36 hours, we pull out!

192
00:19:22,489 --> 00:19:23,339
Rambo!

193
00:19:37,701 --> 00:19:39,859
You did not expect a woman, no?

194
00:19:42,747 --> 00:19:44,367
We'd better go.

195
00:19:47,188 --> 00:19:50,379
We go to river. How come you so late?

196
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,312
Got hung up.

197
00:19:59,435 --> 00:20:02,751
I have arranged boat to take
us down river. Old ways not safe.

198
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:07,026
You come a long way,
Rambo, to see empty camp.

199
00:21:00,994 --> 00:21:02,449
You're using pirates?

200
00:21:02,987 --> 00:21:06,007
Best way down river.
Not get army suspicious.

201
00:22:28,086 --> 00:22:29,639
What about patrol boats?

202
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:52,951
Russian.

203
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,488
Rambo!

204
00:23:22,046 --> 00:23:23,413
Want to eat?

205
00:23:25,366 --> 00:23:26,857
Maybe later.

206
00:23:36,242 --> 00:23:37,903
How you get into this?

207
00:23:40,269 --> 00:23:42,795
- It's a long story.
- Long ride.

208
00:23:46,786 --> 00:23:50,274
Well... after I left the
Special Forces, I...

209
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:54,839
...moved around a lot.
- Why you leave army?

210
00:23:55,296 --> 00:23:56,918
I...

211
00:23:58,202 --> 00:24:00,526
...came back to the States,

212
00:24:01,025 --> 00:24:03,307
and found another war going on.

213
00:24:05,053 --> 00:24:07,169
What war?

214
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:09,909
Kind of like a quiet war.

215
00:24:12,026 --> 00:24:16,433
A war against... all
the soldiers returning.

216
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,025
It's the kind of war you don't win.

217
00:24:22,251 --> 00:24:23,300
It's...

218
00:24:24,136 --> 00:24:25,596
It's my problem.

219
00:24:26,014 --> 00:24:27,891
How about you? How did you get into it?

220
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:31,657
My father worked for intelligence agency.

221
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,700
He killed, and I take his place.

222
00:24:37,971 --> 00:24:39,424
There's too much death here.

223
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,624
Death everywhere.

224
00:24:45,441 --> 00:24:46,935
I just want to live, Rambo.

225
00:24:50,754 --> 00:24:53,906
Maybe go America! Live the quiet life.

226
00:24:58,851 --> 00:25:00,386
What you want?

227
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:05,491
To win... to survive...

228
00:25:07,692 --> 00:25:11,034
Not so easy to survive. Still war here.

229
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:15,538
To survive a war, you gotta become war.

230
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:20,003
That why they pick you?
Because you like to fight?

231
00:25:21,882 --> 00:25:23,133
Nah...

232
00:25:24,547 --> 00:25:26,038
I am expendable.

233
00:25:26,873 --> 00:25:27,916
Expendable?

234
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:30,981
What mean "expendable"?

235
00:25:33,305 --> 00:25:34,343
It's like...

236
00:25:34,882 --> 00:25:40,360
...someone invites you to
a party and you don't show up,

237
00:25:41,234 --> 00:25:42,705
it doesn't really matter.

238
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,652
What's this?

239
00:25:52,899 --> 00:25:54,368
It bring me good luck.

240
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,522
What bring you good luck?

241
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,005
I guess this.

242
00:26:14,772 --> 00:26:16,473
No further report.

243
00:26:16,683 --> 00:26:18,174
I want to go up with the
extraction team at dawn.

244
00:26:19,048 --> 00:26:20,625
- Denied.
- Denied?

245
00:26:21,082 --> 00:26:23,781
- It's an unnecessary risk.
- We have a schedule to keep.

246
00:26:24,238 --> 00:26:26,088
For Who?! We don't even
know if Rambo's alive!

247
00:26:26,089 --> 00:26:27,312
The odds are against it.

248
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:29,885
You said we'd go through as planned.

249
00:26:31,545 --> 00:26:35,364
Okay, if you want to go
through with it, we will.

250
00:26:35,821 --> 00:26:38,104
The Colonel's gonna be
joining the extraction team.

251
00:26:41,259 --> 00:26:43,084
You're a damned good man, Trautman!

252
00:27:40,578 --> 00:27:42,985
See? Camp empty.

253
00:27:44,106 --> 00:27:46,098
We move closer.

254
00:28:30,641 --> 00:28:32,047
Cyclo-girl whore from village.

255
00:28:37,614 --> 00:28:38,735
Come on!

256
00:28:55,051 --> 00:28:57,518
- What is it?
- A bow. No sound.

257
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,731
You not going in there.

258
00:29:06,045 --> 00:29:08,723
But I thought you're
supposed only to take pictures!

259
00:29:09,701 --> 00:29:10,906
What about orders?

260
00:29:11,943 --> 00:29:13,354
No more orders, Co.

261
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,635
I've come to get you out.

262
00:33:00,295 --> 00:33:01,956
Don't talk.

263
00:33:30,431 --> 00:33:32,752
- There are others.
- I'll be back.

264
00:35:14,087 --> 00:35:15,000
Fine?

265
00:35:15,788 --> 00:35:17,324
Let's go!

266
00:35:50,074 --> 00:35:51,547
You have clearance.

267
00:35:52,274 --> 00:35:53,829
Minus one hour to extraction.

268
00:35:54,847 --> 00:35:57,878
I hope for his sake we're
not just wasting fuel...

269
00:35:58,377 --> 00:35:59,743
Let's get moving!

270
00:36:22,871 --> 00:36:23,841
A good thing you came when you did.

271
00:36:24,964 --> 00:36:25,834
Why is that?

272
00:36:27,061 --> 00:36:29,429
They move us around a
lot, to harvest crops.

273
00:36:29,535 --> 00:36:30,859
Only been there a week.

274
00:36:31,565 --> 00:36:33,053
When was the last time
you were in that camp?

275
00:36:33,054 --> 00:36:34,542
A year... yeah.

276
00:36:35,377 --> 00:36:36,941
What year is it, anyway?

277
00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:38,536
1985.

278
00:36:43,062 --> 00:36:44,511
Camp supposed to be empty.

279
00:36:46,177 --> 00:36:47,524
Yeah, supposed to be...

280
00:36:47,525 --> 00:36:48,464
Come on!

281
00:37:20,881 --> 00:37:22,929
L.Z. two klicks up river.

282
00:38:24,973 --> 00:38:27,546
- What has happened?
- We've been sold out.

283
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:30,411
You bastard!

284
00:39:06,233 --> 00:39:07,491
All right, jump!

285
00:39:08,327 --> 00:39:09,265
I fight!

286
00:39:09,761 --> 00:39:11,299
Jump! Go on!

287
00:40:07,008 --> 00:40:08,500
The gunboat!

288
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,472
Jump!

289
00:40:39,966 --> 00:40:41,834
You made it, Rambo!

290
00:40:50,136 --> 00:40:51,299
C'mon!

291
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:18,572
You take this. We go on from here.

292
00:41:19,817 --> 00:41:22,473
- It better I stay to end.
- This is the end.

293
00:41:24,176 --> 00:41:25,173
Go on, let's go!

294
00:41:26,459 --> 00:41:27,497
Rambo!

295
00:41:28,991 --> 00:41:31,025
You not expendable.

296
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:56,636
Colonel, 3 minutes.

297
00:43:09,198 --> 00:43:10,526
That's Rambo!

298
00:43:17,126 --> 00:43:18,539
Christ, he's found one!

299
00:43:48,631 --> 00:43:51,208
Relay the command.
Rambo's found one of ours!

300
00:43:51,913 --> 00:43:53,632
Mr Murdock, Dragonfly
reports that ground crew

301
00:43:53,633 --> 00:43:56,602
has what appears to be an
American POW with them.

302
00:43:57,639 --> 00:44:00,961
- What did you say?
- They've got one of ours!

303
00:44:01,065 --> 00:44:01,900
Hey! Yeah! Yeah!

304
00:44:02,041 --> 00:44:05,030
This station is now on Condition Bravo.
Harrison, Meyers, Goodell, out!

305
00:44:05,112 --> 00:44:06,161
Everybody out!

306
00:44:07,204 --> 00:44:08,247
Come on, move!

307
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,924
Go to your COMINT priority
frequency! Gimme the mike!

308
00:44:13,745 --> 00:44:15,340
Dragonfly, this is Coach 1.

309
00:44:15,446 --> 00:44:17,666
This is an Alpha-Kilo-Victor
command priority.

310
00:44:19,639 --> 00:44:20,885
Come on!

311
00:44:24,414 --> 00:44:26,233
I want you to abort the
mission immediately!

312
00:44:26,272 --> 00:44:28,850
I say again, this is a
recall. Confirm. Over.

313
00:44:28,956 --> 00:44:31,638
Say it again, coach 1, say it again.

314
00:44:32,053 --> 00:44:33,672
I'm tellin' you to abort!

315
00:44:33,776 --> 00:44:34,819
Colonel!

316
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,991
I've been ordered to
abort before pick-up!

317
00:44:36,992 --> 00:44:39,401
Murdock, Murdock, for Christ
sake, we've got 'em in sight!

318
00:44:39,482 --> 00:44:40,747
Murdock, do you read?

319
00:44:43,668 --> 00:44:44,710
Come on!

320
00:44:45,087 --> 00:44:47,220
- We're going down!
- You're not going anywhere.

321
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,348
You goddamned mercenaries!

322
00:44:53,349 --> 00:44:55,341
There's men down there! OUR men!

323
00:44:56,336 --> 00:44:58,656
No, your men. Don't be a hero.

324
00:45:06,714 --> 00:45:07,793
Colonel!

325
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:09,786
Don't leave!

326
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:54,114
What are you doing? Do you
know what the hell you've done?

327
00:45:54,493 --> 00:45:56,057
Don't act so innocent, Colonel!

328
00:45:56,355 --> 00:45:58,701
You had your suspicions,
and if you suspected then,

329
00:45:58,702 --> 00:46:00,422
you're sort of an accessory, aren't you?

330
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:02,533
Don't ever count me
with you and your scum!

331
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:05,231
It was a lie, wasn't it?

332
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,046
Juste like the whole
damn war. It was a lie!

333
00:46:08,252 --> 00:46:09,712
What are you talkin' about?

334
00:46:10,078 --> 00:46:12,789
That camp was supposed to be empty.

335
00:46:13,918 --> 00:46:16,004
Rambo goes in, a decorated Vet,

336
00:46:16,005 --> 00:46:18,924
he finds no POWs, the
Congress buys it, case closed.

337
00:46:18,982 --> 00:46:21,590
And if he happens to get caught,
no one knows he's alive except

338
00:46:21,591 --> 00:46:24,719
you and your computers, and you
can reprogram that, can't you?

339
00:46:24,857 --> 00:46:27,360
Who the hell do you think
you're talkin' to, Trautman?

340
00:46:27,867 --> 00:46:30,474
A stinking bureaucrat
who's tryin' to cover his ass.

341
00:46:30,475 --> 00:46:34,227
No, not just mine,Trautman!
We're talkin' about the nation's!

342
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:37,220
Besides, it was your hero's fault.
Now if your warrior had gone in,

343
00:46:37,221 --> 00:46:39,304
and done what the hell
he was supposed to do,

344
00:46:39,385 --> 00:46:41,367
we'd be out of this clean and simple!

345
00:46:42,201 --> 00:46:44,182
He was just supposed to take pictures.

346
00:46:44,283 --> 00:46:46,055
And if those pictures showed something,

347
00:46:46,056 --> 00:46:48,350
they would have been...
lost, wouldn't they?

348
00:46:49,078 --> 00:46:52,155
Oh, Trautman, I still don't think
you understand what this is all about.

349
00:46:52,173 --> 00:46:53,946
The same as it always is: money.

350
00:46:55,035 --> 00:46:58,373
In '72, we were supposed to pay the
Cong 4.5 billion in war reparations.

351
00:46:58,542 --> 00:47:01,149
We reneged, they kept the POWs.

352
00:47:01,573 --> 00:47:04,180
And you're doing the
same thing all over again.

353
00:47:04,852 --> 00:47:06,416
What the hell would you do, Trautman?

354
00:47:06,761 --> 00:47:08,899
Pay blackmail money
to ransom our own men,

355
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,662
and finance the war
effort against our allies?

356
00:47:11,972 --> 00:47:14,840
What if some burnt-out POW
shows up on the 6 o'clock news?

357
00:47:14,981 --> 00:47:15,866
What you wanna do?

358
00:47:15,972 --> 00:47:18,213
Start the war all over again,
you wanna bomb Hanoi,

359
00:47:18,248 --> 00:47:20,595
wanna everybody screaming
for armed invasion?

360
00:47:20,701 --> 00:47:23,463
You think civilians are gonna get up on
the floor of the United States Senate,

361
00:47:23,495 --> 00:47:26,883
and ask for billions of dollars
for a couple of forgotten ghosts?

362
00:47:26,916 --> 00:47:29,940
Men, goddamn it! Men who
fought for their country!

363
00:47:29,941 --> 00:47:31,296
That's enough!

364
00:47:32,063 --> 00:47:33,106
Trautman...

365
00:47:33,941 --> 00:47:36,653
I'm gonna forget this
conversation ever took place.

366
00:47:38,769 --> 00:47:39,915
You bastard!

367
00:47:40,542 --> 00:47:41,585
And if I were you,

368
00:47:41,756 --> 00:47:44,624
I'd never make the mistake of
bringing this subject up again!

369
00:47:45,041 --> 00:47:46,761
You're the one who's making the mistake.

370
00:47:46,841 --> 00:47:48,197
Yeah? What mistake?

371
00:47:49,663 --> 00:47:50,916
Rambo.

372
00:48:50,789 --> 00:48:52,550
Damned Russian bastards!

373
00:49:18,312 --> 00:49:19,825
He's dead now.

374
00:49:30,371 --> 00:49:31,927
Bring him up!

375
00:49:51,313 --> 00:49:52,641
The knife!

376
00:49:53,138 --> 00:49:56,168
These people are so
vulgar in their methods.

377
00:49:57,207 --> 00:49:58,906
They lack compassion.

378
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:04,423
I'm Lieutenant-Colonel Podovski.

379
00:50:07,711 --> 00:50:10,076
I do not know who you are yet,

380
00:50:10,576 --> 00:50:11,984
but I will!

381
00:50:12,816 --> 00:50:14,394
Take him and clean him up.

382
00:50:49,117 --> 00:50:50,571
That's all.

383
00:50:51,028 --> 00:50:53,908
Thank you, Captain Vinh.
Leave one guard, please.

384
00:50:59,579 --> 00:51:01,502
I see you are no stranger to pain.

385
00:51:03,315 --> 00:51:06,425
Perhaps you have been among
my Vietnamese comrades before?

386
00:51:09,832 --> 00:51:11,077
No answer?

387
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:14,125
Do you wish to give your name?

388
00:51:15,145 --> 00:51:17,443
What possible harm can that cause?

389
00:51:21,455 --> 00:51:24,194
Pride is a poor
substitute for intelligence.

390
00:51:25,066 --> 00:51:28,470
What you must understand is
that we have to interrogate you.

391
00:51:31,127 --> 00:51:32,305
To Sergeant Yushin here,

392
00:51:32,306 --> 00:51:35,049
you're piece of meat,
a laboratory experiment.

393
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:39,305
But to me, you are a
comrade, similar to myself,

394
00:51:39,491 --> 00:51:42,749
just opposed by an act of fate.

395
00:51:44,284 --> 00:51:48,696
I know you were trying to facilitate
the release of war criminals held

396
00:51:48,766 --> 00:51:51,509
by this Republic. I can appreciate this.

397
00:51:52,381 --> 00:51:56,406
But this incident, your capture, is...

398
00:51:58,399 --> 00:51:59,645
...embarrassing.

399
00:52:00,266 --> 00:52:02,135
We must have explanation.

400
00:52:03,322 --> 00:52:05,829
First of all, I wish you to
radio your headquarters,

401
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:10,841
and say that you have been captured
and condemned for espionage activities,

402
00:52:11,444 --> 00:52:15,933
and that no such criminal agression
should be attempted in the future!

403
00:52:16,165 --> 00:52:20,293
Or they will meet with
the same fate as yours.

404
00:52:30,052 --> 00:52:31,400
Fuck you!

405
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:38,732
You wish to test your
strength... Good. Good!

406
00:52:42,255 --> 00:52:43,519
Yushin!

407
00:53:43,795 --> 00:53:49,398
Comrade, here is something
that might be of interest to you:

408
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:53,538
a transcript of the conversation
between your helicopter pilot

409
00:53:53,925 --> 00:53:57,244
and his commander we intercepted.

410
00:53:58,697 --> 00:54:03,056
"Dragonfly"... "Wolf's
Den"... colorful names!

411
00:54:03,968 --> 00:54:05,361
Here we are:

412
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,677
"We have them in sight".

413
00:54:07,991 --> 00:54:12,667
And the reply: "Abort the
operation immediately. "

414
00:54:13,973 --> 00:54:18,374
"This is a recall. Confirm. Over. "

415
00:54:19,536 --> 00:54:22,683
It seems you were
abandoned by direct command.

416
00:54:24,163 --> 00:54:27,608
And these are the people
you protect... with your pain!

417
00:54:32,676 --> 00:54:36,243
You may scream. There is no shame.

418
00:55:06,981 --> 00:55:09,680
You are strong... Very strong!

419
00:55:10,137 --> 00:55:12,276
The strongest so far.

420
00:55:12,751 --> 00:55:16,156
But you're nearly dead! Poor waif.

421
00:55:16,736 --> 00:55:18,451
Make the radio call.

422
00:55:44,715 --> 00:55:47,954
To talk, to obey would
be so much easier.

423
00:56:02,064 --> 00:56:05,510
Yushin has a memento
for you of this occasion!

424
00:56:28,325 --> 00:56:30,106
Put it in his eye.

425
00:56:37,207 --> 00:56:41,733
If your own life means nothing
to you, then perhaps his does.

426
00:56:42,231 --> 00:56:45,883
- Don't tell them anything!
- You will talk.

427
00:56:55,889 --> 00:56:56,840
Yes?

428
00:57:32,166 --> 00:57:33,827
Don't do it!

429
00:57:36,214 --> 00:57:37,626
Do it!

430
00:57:38,083 --> 00:57:39,327
Now!

431
00:58:08,698 --> 00:58:11,729
Two-two-O-five-six...

432
00:58:13,122 --> 00:58:14,841
Lone Wolf, receive.

433
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:18,911
This is Lone Wolf, two-two-O-five-six

434
00:58:19,782 --> 00:58:21,857
Lone Wolf, this is Wolf's Den.

435
00:58:21,858 --> 00:58:23,830
Transmit location and status. Over.

436
00:58:24,039 --> 00:58:25,082
What is it?

437
00:58:25,516 --> 00:58:26,940
It's Rambo, Sir.

438
00:58:28,583 --> 00:58:31,091
We read you, Lone Wolf.
What is your position? Over.

439
00:58:33,232 --> 00:58:36,097
I say again: What is
your position? Over.

440
00:58:37,381 --> 00:58:41,368
Your friend dies if you do not answer.

441
00:58:42,964 --> 00:58:44,728
Johnny, this is Trautman.
Where the hell are you?

442
00:58:49,793 --> 00:58:51,287
John, come in!

443
00:59:00,275 --> 00:59:01,229
Murdock?

444
00:59:02,724 --> 00:59:04,260
He's here.

445
00:59:08,661 --> 00:59:11,108
Rambo, this is Murdock,
we're glad you're alive!

446
00:59:11,855 --> 00:59:12,888
Where are you?

447
00:59:14,036 --> 00:59:16,214
Give us your position, and
we'll come to pick you up.

448
00:59:25,099 --> 00:59:26,136
Murdock...

449
00:59:29,582 --> 00:59:31,033
I'm comin' to get you!

450
01:01:53,978 --> 01:01:55,431
Duck!

451
01:03:00,602 --> 01:03:02,015
This way.

452
01:03:40,122 --> 01:03:41,904
We safe for now.

453
01:03:46,220 --> 01:03:50,580
- You look like hell, Rambo.
- Tough night.

454
01:03:51,659 --> 01:03:53,818
Maybe need this.

455
01:03:56,309 --> 01:03:59,380
- You hurt bad.
- It's alright.

456
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:07,682
Listen...

457
01:04:08,595 --> 01:04:11,667
What you did back there...

458
01:04:12,207 --> 01:04:14,489
...I won't forget it.

459
01:04:16,150 --> 01:04:17,188
Thanks.

460
01:04:20,450 --> 01:04:21,528
What you do now?

461
01:04:22,130 --> 01:04:23,808
Try to get across to Thailand?

462
01:04:24,619 --> 01:04:25,572
Yeah.

463
01:04:25,989 --> 01:04:27,345
Then go America?

464
01:04:27,658 --> 01:04:28,610
Yeah.

465
01:04:34,666 --> 01:04:36,219
You take me with you?

466
01:04:47,948 --> 01:04:49,444
You take me?

467
01:04:52,227 --> 01:04:53,180
Yeah.

468
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:57,829
I think you make good choice.

469
01:04:58,664 --> 01:04:59,602
Yeah.

470
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:02,750
- We go?
- Let's go.

471
01:05:39,962 --> 01:05:41,581
You alright?

472
01:05:55,697 --> 01:05:58,395
Rambo... You... not... forget... me.

473
01:05:58,893 --> 01:05:59,930
No.

474
01:06:00,974 --> 01:06:01,913
No.

475
01:06:02,122 --> 01:06:03,060
No.

476
01:06:18,339 --> 01:06:20,393
I want the rescue team
ready to go in one hour.

477
01:06:20,394 --> 01:06:21,542
You're risking your career,

478
01:06:21,543 --> 01:06:23,419
your reputation, and even
your family's security!

479
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:26,202
Do you honestly think any
one man's worth all that?

480
01:06:26,203 --> 01:06:27,037
Yes, I do.

481
01:06:27,284 --> 01:06:29,630
I'm getting you a direct order
to withdraw from this project.

482
01:06:29,631 --> 01:06:31,768
Do I get the rescue team
or do I go over your head?

483
01:06:31,849 --> 01:06:33,694
You don't seem to understand something:

484
01:06:33,799 --> 01:06:36,999
I'm in charge here. You're just a tool.

485
01:06:38,098 --> 01:06:39,505
We're the machine.

486
01:06:40,732 --> 01:06:43,370
I want him placed under arrest.
He's not to leave the base.

487
01:06:48,102 --> 01:06:49,113
He never had a chance, did he?

488
01:06:49,845 --> 01:06:52,002
Like you said, Colonel: he went home.

489
01:21:00,089 --> 01:21:01,131
Yeah! Over here!

490
01:21:07,918 --> 01:21:08,960
Get back!

491
01:21:13,729 --> 01:21:15,815
C'mon! Go to the chopper! Move, move!

492
01:21:17,846 --> 01:21:20,009
Go to the chopper!
Go to the chopper!

493
01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:22,375
Move!

494
01:21:23,106 --> 01:21:24,149
Go to the chopper!

495
01:21:24,986 --> 01:21:26,029
That's it!

496
01:21:26,238 --> 01:21:27,281
Move, move, move!

497
01:21:29,369 --> 01:21:30,412
Hold on!

498
01:21:36,809 --> 01:21:38,268
C'mon! Move it, move it!

499
01:21:42,654 --> 01:21:44,009
Move, move, move, move!

500
01:21:52,988 --> 01:21:54,449
A man at the gun!

501
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:09,611
Yeah, Yeah!

502
01:22:11,177 --> 01:22:12,429
You guys made it!

503
01:22:50,322 --> 01:22:51,573
Chopper on our tail!

504
01:22:54,456 --> 01:22:55,394
Hang on!

505
01:24:25,074 --> 01:24:26,012
Hold on!

506
01:24:32,625 --> 01:24:34,189
Fire in the tail!

507
01:26:38,695 --> 01:26:40,572
Lone Wolf calling Wolf's Den. Over.

508
01:26:42,266 --> 01:26:44,142
Lone Wolf calling Wolf's Den. Over.

509
01:26:46,146 --> 01:26:48,858
Wolf's Den, this is
Lone wolf, do you read?

510
01:26:49,973 --> 01:26:51,746
Wolf's den, this is Lone Wolf, over.

511
01:26:52,060 --> 01:26:53,623
Yes, we hear you, Lone Wolf. Over.

512
01:26:54,534 --> 01:26:56,515
Prepare for emergency landing.

513
01:26:57,037 --> 01:26:59,123
Arriving with American POWs.

514
01:27:11,134 --> 01:27:11,968
You heard!

515
01:27:12,386 --> 01:27:14,263
Prepare for arriving POWs! Let's move!

516
01:28:32,122 --> 01:28:33,165
Glad you made it!

517
01:29:46,765 --> 01:29:48,851
Rambo, I don't make the orders.

518
01:29:48,857 --> 01:29:50,839
I take'em, just like you.

519
01:29:55,145 --> 01:29:59,316
I swear to God I didn't know it
was supposed to happen like this.

520
01:29:59,461 --> 01:30:02,068
It was just supposed to
be another assignment.

521
01:30:09,757 --> 01:30:10,800
Mission...

522
01:30:12,679 --> 01:30:13,722
...accomplished!

523
01:30:21,255 --> 01:30:23,340
You know there's more men out there.

524
01:30:24,327 --> 01:30:25,891
You know where they are.

525
01:30:28,645 --> 01:30:30,209
Find'em...

526
01:30:30,523 --> 01:30:32,087
...or I'll find you!

527
01:30:55,203 --> 01:30:56,141
John!

528
01:30:57,185 --> 01:30:58,540
Where are you going?

529
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:00,430
I don't know.

530
01:31:03,037 --> 01:31:05,122
You'll get a second
Medal of Honor for this.

531
01:31:13,683 --> 01:31:15,247
They should give it to them.

532
01:31:16,604 --> 01:31:18,168
They deserve it more.

533
01:31:19,619 --> 01:31:22,330
You can't keep running,
John. You're free now.

534
01:31:23,604 --> 01:31:24,646
Come back with us.

535
01:31:26,925 --> 01:31:27,968
Back to what?

536
01:31:29,831 --> 01:31:31,291
My friends died here...

537
01:31:33,484 --> 01:31:34,943
Part of me died here...

538
01:31:36,973 --> 01:31:39,371
The war, everything that happened
here may have been wrong,

539
01:31:39,474 --> 01:31:41,455
but dammit, don't
hate your country for it!

540
01:31:43,446 --> 01:31:44,384
Hate?

541
01:31:45,533 --> 01:31:46,890
I'd die for it!

542
01:31:49,092 --> 01:31:50,552
Then what is it you want?

543
01:31:56,315 --> 01:31:57,357
I want...

544
01:32:00,490 --> 01:32:01,741
...what they want,

545
01:32:02,577 --> 01:32:05,810
and every other guy who came over here,

546
01:32:06,526 --> 01:32:11,323
and spilt his guts and gave
everything he had, wants...

547
01:32:12,795 --> 01:32:14,671
...for our country to love us...

548
01:32:15,658 --> 01:32:18,058
...as much as WE love it.

549
01:32:20,433 --> 01:32:21,893
That's what I want.

550
01:32:28,818 --> 01:32:30,382
How will you live, John?

551
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:32,050
Day by day.
