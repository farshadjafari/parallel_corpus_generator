1
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,538
All present and accounted for, sir.

2
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,289
Thank you, Captain.

3
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,757
As of this moment...

4
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:54,263
...you are the property of
the Penal Administration of French Guiana.

5
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:58,809
After serving your full terms in prison...

6
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:02,145
...those of you with sentences...

7
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:04,940
...of eight years or more...

8
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:07,651
...will remain in Guiana...

9
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:10,195
...as workers and colonists...

10
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:14,616
...for a period equal
to that of your original sentences.

11
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:17,286
As for France...

12
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,913
...the nation has disposed of you.

13
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:24,501
France has rid herself of you altogether.

14
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:29,339
Forget France and put your clothes on.

15
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,874
Papillon! Papi!

16
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,128
You'll be back, Papillon.

17
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,046
Don't worry, you'll be back.

18
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,013
No, you won't.

19
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:55,235
You, that way.

20
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:57,779
Down there. You, too.

21
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:00,532
Next, over here. Come along.

22
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,035
Come on. Come in here.

23
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:04,870
You, too.

24
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,205
Over there.

25
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,875
Come along, up there. Hurry up.

26
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,339
You, too. Down.

27
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,132
Down. In there.

28
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:18,759
In there.

29
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,678
Come along, now. Down.

30
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,431
Come on down. Down there.

31
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,022
Come on, up there.

32
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,191
In there.

33
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,423
We're really something, aren't we?

34
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:25,219
The only animals in the world
that shove things up their ass for survival.

35
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,138
The first time I shoved one up my gut...

36
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:31,391
...it infected me so bad
the camp doctor had to cut it out.

37
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,936
He doesn't have any ether...

38
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,480
...so he knocks me out with rum.

39
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,149
Then you know what he did?

40
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,317
He stole it.

41
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:45,822
A butterfly.

42
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,367
You're Papillon, aren't you?

43
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:49,826
Yeah.

44
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,037
The bastards gave you life.

45
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:56,166
Right to the end of the line, they think.

46
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,377
It may not be as long as you think.

47
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:00,337
Forty percent of us will die...

48
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,047
...the first year out.

49
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,220
They gave him life, too.

50
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,347
The kid's only 18.

51
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,975
Look at him. No wonder he dreams.

52
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,186
He'll never make it.

53
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:22,192
But a man like you could make it...

54
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:24,152
...if you have enough money.

55
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,196
How long were you there?

56
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:28,991
Nine years of work camp...

57
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:31,702
...nine years a colonist.

58
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:34,538
You were outside the walls.
Why didn't you run?

59
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,957
There's no place to run to.

60
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:40,294
You're out in the middle of a swamp,
1,000 miles from no place.

61
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:43,172
Now, if you've got a lot of money
that's a different thing.

62
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:46,592
I mean, you take somebody
like Dega there. Back there.

63
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:51,722
Louis Dega.
The best counterfeiter in France.

64
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,057
National Defense Bonds.

65
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:56,268
-Series of 1928.
-Right.

66
00:07:57,895 --> 00:08:01,732
Now, if you've got money like he has,
there's a chance to buy your way out.

67
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:07,321
That is unless somebody cuts
his guts open first to get at all that cash.

68
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,241
Everybody up! Let's go!

69
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,534
Everybody up!

70
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:14,870
Come on, everybody up! Let's go!

71
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:15,996
Let's go!

72
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,277
Mind if I sit down here?

73
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:50,531
If you wish.

74
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,246
You're Dega, aren't ya? Louis Dega?

75
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,377
Sorry to see you here.

76
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,963
I presume most of us have earned
our passage.

77
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:11,927
You're Papillon. You got life for killing
a pimp. Then you had the bad taste...

78
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:15,013
...to tell the prosecutor you were going
to escape and kill him, too.

79
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:16,807
I was framed. I'm innocent.

80
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:18,475
No one is innocent.

81
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,561
I'm no pimp killer, for Christ's sake.

82
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:21,979
I'm a safecracker.

83
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:25,732
And that's a profession of which
I thoroughly disapprove.

84
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:29,862
I put almost everything I had
into National Defense Bonds.

85
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,198
Series of 1928.

86
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:35,158
1928?

87
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:39,955
Your instincts were sound.
How much did you lose?

88
00:09:40,164 --> 00:09:43,250
I wouldn't put my money on those bonds.
Not any more than you would.

89
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:45,085
I'm relieved to hear that.

90
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:47,504
If that's true,
why are we having this little chat?

91
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:52,843
Every convict on this ship knows
who you are.

92
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:57,514
Any of them would slit you open to
reach inside and get what you're carrying.

93
00:09:58,515 --> 00:09:59,516
So?

94
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:02,102
You need protection.

95
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:04,313
From you?

96
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,153
Remember what the chicken said
to the weasel?

97
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:16,241
If he was a healthy weasel, the chicken
didn't get a chance to say anything.

98
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,202
Think about that.

99
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:41,642
Hose down!

100
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:44,061
Come on, off your asses! Hose down!

101
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:52,486
Come on, you've got a fever.

102
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:53,904
Do what I tell ya.

103
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:56,490
Come on.

104
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:57,741
Julot!

105
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,287
I've got a question.

106
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:06,834
If I wanted to get a boat when I got there,
a small boat, maybe a 15-footer...

107
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:07,918
...how much would it cost?

108
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,463
I don't know. Fr 3,500, Fr 4,500, maybe.
It all depends.

109
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:13,841
What if I could pick up the money
to buy one?

110
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:15,759
Then I guess you'd have yourself a boat.

111
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:18,971
You know the country.
You and I could make it out of there. Huh?

112
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:22,599
The answer is no. Nothing against you,
but the answer is no.

113
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,520
If I've gotta go to solitary for
some half-assed escape that didn't work...

114
00:11:26,562 --> 00:11:29,940
...l want the mistake to be mine,
not anybody else's. You understand?

115
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,567
So the answer is no.

116
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,610
How'd it feel, kid?

117
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:34,862
Good.

118
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,903
All right. Come on, move it!

119
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:05,869
Move it a little. Let's go!

120
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,250
Let's move!

121
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:35,399
What do you want?

122
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:37,150
Almost unbearable, isn't it?

123
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:39,862
What?

124
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:41,530
The heat.

125
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:43,156
It's not too bad.

126
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:46,159
Of course, you're closer to it than I am.

127
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:50,247
Oh, yes. You're referring to last night,
aren't you?

128
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:52,958
Well, aren't you?

129
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,960
May I tell you something?

130
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:58,463
At first glance I'm afraid
that I regarded you with rather...

131
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,758
...a large degree of unworthy suspicion.

132
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:03,468
Am I clear?

133
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:04,553
No.

134
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:09,308
Well, it now seems quite possible
that until we get to a decent jail...

135
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:13,353
...with bribeable guards,
I may stand in some need of...

136
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,191
...rather close physical protection.

137
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:20,736
It depends on how long you want to live.

138
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:22,112
Oh, a long time.

139
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,158
Then you got a problem.

140
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:29,203
Well, I presume that you have some...

141
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,122
...goals, some particular need that...

142
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,124
...outweighs all others.

143
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:38,128
I mean, if so, may I ask what it is?

144
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:39,505
Money.

145
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:40,881
For what?

146
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:42,174
Escape.

147
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:44,176
Very good.

148
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,803
You keep me alive...

149
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:51,517
...until we land in Guiana and I will
underwrite any escape you care to arrange.

150
00:14:52,518 --> 00:14:54,853
Escape for me. Not for us.

151
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:56,772
Of course.

152
00:14:58,357 --> 00:15:01,985
I have no intention of even attempting
an escape. Ever.

153
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:06,281
Done.

154
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:10,160
Thank you.

155
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,274
Leave him alone...

156
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,067
...or I'll cut your head off!

157
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:27,738
Hide this!

158
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,975
Over there is Saint Joseph.

159
00:16:58,268 --> 00:17:00,020
The other island is Royale.

160
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:02,064
The one on the right is Devil's.

161
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:05,984
Julot, why is it so hard
to escape from there?

162
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:09,321
A man could almost swim to the mainland.

163
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:11,782
No, there must be a better way
than swimming.

164
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:13,492
No, no, swimming's not the way.

165
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:17,246
The current is so strong it'll push you
right back where you started from.

166
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:21,083
You know, when you're on those islands
you're there for keeps.

167
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:26,839
Where do we go?

168
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:30,884
We go up the Moroni River.

169
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:33,220
Then we dock at Saint Laurent.

170
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:36,598
That's where they decide whether
to send you to the work camps or...

171
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,724
...to the islands.

172
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:19,183
You see those two on the dock
with the guns?

173
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:20,684
Right over there.

174
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:26,023
They served their time.
Now they're colonists.

175
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:28,692
They've turned man hunter.

176
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:29,902
Man hunter?

177
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,404
Yeah, you escape, they hunt.

178
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,740
For money, I presume, a reward.

179
00:18:35,324 --> 00:18:36,325
Jesus!

180
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:37,743
Get ready to move!

181
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,536
Line up to disembark.

182
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:04,561
I'm going to have an accident going down
that gangplank and it's gotta look good...

183
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:05,938
...so lend me your shiv.

184
00:19:06,063 --> 00:19:07,439
What the hell for?

185
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:09,107
Because I'm a two-time loser.

186
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:12,444
No matter what happens, I'll be sent
to the islands on the next transport.

187
00:19:12,486 --> 00:19:14,488
I have to get in the hospital
to give me time to think.

188
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,198
Now give me that shiv!

189
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:50,482
You're crazy, Julot.

190
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:53,110
Single file down the gangplank. March.

191
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,084
Hold it! Hold it!

192
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:32,065
Let's go!

193
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,401
Single file!

194
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:41,200
Move! Let's go!

195
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:44,161
Bring a stretcher.

196
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:48,415
Single file, single file.

197
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:54,463
Take him away!

198
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:56,924
-All right, move! Move!
-Let's go!

199
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:57,758
Move it!

200
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:20,906
Come on, move 'em!

201
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:22,950
Let's go! Come on!

202
00:21:57,776 --> 00:21:59,069
Column, march!

203
00:22:38,817 --> 00:22:40,110
Keep moving.

204
00:23:18,482 --> 00:23:20,359
You two, pick him up, quickly!

205
00:24:30,554 --> 00:24:31,763
Attention!

206
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:42,566
Welcome to the Penal Colony...

207
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:44,860
...of French Guiana...

208
00:24:45,611 --> 00:24:47,321
...whose prisoners you are...

209
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:50,240
...and from which there is no escape.

210
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:53,160
First attempts at escape...

211
00:24:53,702 --> 00:24:56,830
...add two years in solitary
to existing sentences.

212
00:24:58,123 --> 00:25:00,125
Second attempts, add five more.

213
00:25:01,168 --> 00:25:03,337
Of course, more serious offenses...

214
00:25:04,129 --> 00:25:07,257
...are dealt with in this fashion.

215
00:25:16,183 --> 00:25:20,938
Make the best of what we offer you
and you will suffer less than you deserve.

216
00:25:22,231 --> 00:25:23,232
Dismissed.

217
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:29,863
In the bunkhouse.

218
00:25:29,947 --> 00:25:32,616
One, two, three, four.

219
00:25:32,908 --> 00:25:35,410
Go on! Go on! Get a move on!

220
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,127
Mr. Dega?

221
00:25:44,878 --> 00:25:47,923
Yes, indeed.
I know all about you, Mr. Dega.

222
00:25:48,465 --> 00:25:49,716
Very intelligent man.

223
00:25:49,758 --> 00:25:52,636
Thank you. I seem to be known
in all the wrong places.

224
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:56,682
Well, I have a friend who is a guard.
For very--

225
00:25:58,308 --> 00:25:59,268
Yes, go ahead.

226
00:25:59,393 --> 00:26:03,814
For very little money he can arrange
for certain people to stay here...

227
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:07,776
...instead of being sent to a work camp
or one of the islands.

228
00:26:08,527 --> 00:26:11,488
Can he get us a job here
so we can walk around the place?

229
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:14,324
Perhaps a selection from which
we may choose?

230
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:16,660
Oh, yes. That is, my friend can.

231
00:26:17,578 --> 00:26:20,122
You take our money,
and you put your life on the line.

232
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,291
Of course.

233
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:24,293
How much will it cost?

234
00:26:24,543 --> 00:26:29,298
Well, my friend has a very large family.
Many little children, you understand?

235
00:26:29,715 --> 00:26:32,301
And his sergeant has a mother,
heart trouble.

236
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:34,845
He was asking you how much,
not how many.

237
00:26:34,928 --> 00:26:37,139
If you don't mind, I'll do the negotiating.

238
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,351
How much?

239
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:45,314
For you, Fr 500. For him, Fr 1,500.

240
00:26:46,815 --> 00:26:48,192
He made trouble.

241
00:26:48,275 --> 00:26:52,738
Yes, indeed he did. Nevertheless,
I'll give you Fr 1,250 for the both of us.

242
00:26:53,989 --> 00:26:56,325
Now, you take it or leave it as you wish.

243
00:27:14,301 --> 00:27:15,385
Try again.

244
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:19,932
Very well. I want two pairs
of comfortable shoes for the both of us...

245
00:27:20,015 --> 00:27:21,934
...and you, you get the Fr 2,000.

246
00:27:23,769 --> 00:27:25,395
Don't you have to go to the toilet?

247
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:28,023
Oh, yes, of course.
Would you excuse me a moment?

248
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:31,818
You don't need to, Mr. Dega.
Unless, of course, you want to.

249
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,571
I can pick it up in the morning.

250
00:28:10,107 --> 00:28:11,483
Get moving, white men!

251
00:28:12,651 --> 00:28:15,153
Let's go! Come on, move it!

252
00:28:15,237 --> 00:28:16,989
Let's go! Come on, move it!

253
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,448
On your feet!

254
00:29:03,702 --> 00:29:07,331
Attention! Present arms!

255
00:29:15,547 --> 00:29:17,007
No! No!

256
00:29:23,263 --> 00:29:24,306
No!

257
00:29:44,201 --> 00:29:46,495
Mr. Dega, did you get the money?

258
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,462
Move it! Move it! Move it!

259
00:29:57,339 --> 00:29:59,049
Get going! Move it!

260
00:30:02,594 --> 00:30:04,304
Fischer, what the hell's wrong?

261
00:30:04,388 --> 00:30:06,348
Someone broke out
of the hospital compound.

262
00:30:09,268 --> 00:30:11,603
All right, break it up. We'll get him.

263
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,314
Next.

264
00:30:19,736 --> 00:30:20,737
Next.

265
00:30:28,954 --> 00:30:30,414
You're fine. Next.

266
00:30:30,497 --> 00:30:32,040
I must be better than I feel.

267
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:35,043
You're in wonderful shape.

268
00:30:36,795 --> 00:30:38,922
How do you fail an examination like this?

269
00:30:39,006 --> 00:30:40,048
Next.

270
00:30:43,969 --> 00:30:45,387
7551 .

271
00:30:49,266 --> 00:30:49,933
Dega?

272
00:30:50,267 --> 00:30:51,894
Yes, sir, Louis Dega.

273
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:54,146
It was suggested that I speak to you, sir--

274
00:30:54,313 --> 00:30:55,397
I have it right here.

275
00:30:55,564 --> 00:30:58,442
We'll just keep you on here
in the cleaning squad.

276
00:30:58,817 --> 00:31:00,861
Thank you, sir. There's also my friend.

277
00:31:00,903 --> 00:31:02,070
You're Louis Dega?

278
00:31:02,154 --> 00:31:04,740
I am, sir. And this is my friend, Papillon.

279
00:31:04,865 --> 00:31:06,742
We have a great deal in common,
Mr. Dega.

280
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:08,494
I'm extremely glad to see you.

281
00:31:08,535 --> 00:31:11,455
Why, thank you, sir.
Of course, if the circumstances were--

282
00:31:11,497 --> 00:31:15,125
My family lost everything they had
in counterfeit National Defense Bonds.

283
00:31:19,171 --> 00:31:21,590
Oh, I'm very sorry to hear that, sir.

284
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,969
Even so, buying them was a tribute
to their patriotism, wouldn't you say?

285
00:31:27,471 --> 00:31:29,348
And you're Mr. Dega's friend?

286
00:31:29,806 --> 00:31:30,599
Well--

287
00:31:30,724 --> 00:31:32,976
There's one thing about Saint Laurent
you'll like:

288
00:31:33,018 --> 00:31:35,062
We never separate old friends.

289
00:31:36,063 --> 00:31:38,607
Kilo 40. Both of them. Today's transport.

290
00:31:46,448 --> 00:31:48,116
What is Kilo 40?

291
00:32:09,721 --> 00:32:12,391
Don't touch him.
You'll wind up worse off than he is.

292
00:32:12,516 --> 00:32:14,101
Move! Get moving!

293
00:32:20,566 --> 00:32:21,525
Duck!

294
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,864
Get up, you lazy bastards!

295
00:32:27,447 --> 00:32:29,408
You get that crock
and you bring him along!

296
00:32:29,491 --> 00:32:32,161
You! Pick another man
and grab that crock.

297
00:32:43,547 --> 00:32:45,465
Come on, move!

298
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:46,967
Move!

299
00:33:07,404 --> 00:33:09,615
The son of a bitch isn't dead,
they just irritated him!

300
00:33:09,656 --> 00:33:12,075
Get his tail. You get his tail.

301
00:33:13,869 --> 00:33:15,496
-Where's his tail?
-Over there.

302
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:20,667
-Are you ready?
-Yeah.

303
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:22,252
-So am l.
-Go ahead.

304
00:33:22,336 --> 00:33:23,295
Okay.

305
00:33:27,424 --> 00:33:28,467
Ready?

306
00:33:29,468 --> 00:33:31,178
-Is that the tail?
-No.

307
00:33:31,762 --> 00:33:33,597
I'd better go over to this side.

308
00:33:36,767 --> 00:33:37,851
You get the head.

309
00:33:37,976 --> 00:33:39,102
-The head?
-Yeah.

310
00:33:40,103 --> 00:33:41,313
You try the tail.

311
00:33:44,274 --> 00:33:45,859
Okay, now you try the head.

312
00:33:49,112 --> 00:33:50,072
Grab him!

313
00:33:51,949 --> 00:33:53,075
He's dead.

314
00:33:53,575 --> 00:33:54,952
He's still talking.

315
00:33:57,913 --> 00:33:59,039
He's dead!

316
00:34:00,332 --> 00:34:01,416
He's dead?

317
00:34:10,425 --> 00:34:11,468
Move it!

318
00:34:19,184 --> 00:34:20,269
Come on.

319
00:34:21,687 --> 00:34:23,063
Come on, hands up.

320
00:34:23,522 --> 00:34:24,565
Next!

321
00:34:25,315 --> 00:34:26,191
Move!

322
00:34:28,527 --> 00:34:29,528
Next!

323
00:34:30,154 --> 00:34:31,488
Bring it around here.

324
00:34:31,738 --> 00:34:33,740
Just lay the crock right there.

325
00:34:33,782 --> 00:34:35,576
-Just drop it.
-Hold it.

326
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:37,953
Move out.

327
00:34:39,913 --> 00:34:41,373
He's pretty big.

328
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,125
This skin's worth some money.

329
00:34:52,134 --> 00:34:53,177
Move it!

330
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:55,262
What the hell are you looking at?

331
00:35:16,783 --> 00:35:17,784
You're Louis Dega.

332
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:20,871
Yes, sir.

333
00:35:20,954 --> 00:35:22,289
I'm Clusiot.

334
00:35:22,581 --> 00:35:25,125
How come you ended up
in a place like this?

335
00:35:26,627 --> 00:35:27,669
Favoritism.

336
00:35:34,384 --> 00:35:36,178
Friend's kind of quiet, isn't he?

337
00:35:36,428 --> 00:35:37,471
He's dead.

338
00:35:38,847 --> 00:35:42,559
He jammed a piece of wood down
his throat and choked himself to death.

339
00:35:45,312 --> 00:35:46,813
Three-way split....

340
00:35:47,523 --> 00:35:48,982
It's fair, isn't it?

341
00:36:07,376 --> 00:36:08,377
Quinine.

342
00:36:09,294 --> 00:36:11,547
Worst country in the world for malaria.

343
00:36:20,597 --> 00:36:22,349
Here, take them.

344
00:36:23,892 --> 00:36:25,936
Go ahead, I've got some left.

345
00:36:27,729 --> 00:36:30,232
Well, if I'm going to get my sleep...

346
00:36:31,066 --> 00:36:33,735
...I'll have to take this poor bastard
with me.

347
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:39,700
A decent man.

348
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,580
Dega....

349
00:36:46,623 --> 00:36:49,251
The man hunters.
The ones we saw down at the dock.

350
00:36:50,127 --> 00:36:51,295
Son of a bitches.

351
00:36:57,926 --> 00:37:00,220
-Butterflies?
-Yeah, that's right.

352
00:37:00,804 --> 00:37:02,222
Some guy named Richter.

353
00:37:02,347 --> 00:37:05,976
He works every camp on the river
buying the damn things.

354
00:37:06,643 --> 00:37:10,272
We catch them, he buys them,
the guards get the big payoff.

355
00:37:10,814 --> 00:37:13,150
It's called the Blue Morphus butterfly.

356
00:37:13,483 --> 00:37:17,070
It's wings are used for dye
in making American currency.

357
00:37:19,573 --> 00:37:21,200
How often does he come up here?

358
00:37:21,283 --> 00:37:22,701
A couple of times a month.

359
00:37:22,784 --> 00:37:23,577
Boat?

360
00:37:23,702 --> 00:37:25,037
No other way.

361
00:37:25,996 --> 00:37:27,372
-Why?
-Thinking.

362
00:37:28,832 --> 00:37:31,502
I handle a boat pretty good myself,
you know?

363
00:37:32,294 --> 00:37:33,128
Yeah?

364
00:38:00,572 --> 00:38:03,283
You're supposed to catch them,
you clumsy bastard.

365
00:39:11,727 --> 00:39:14,563
-Where do you send these bugs, sir?
-The United States.

366
00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:22,988
How much would you charge
to send this one to Panama?

367
00:39:27,284 --> 00:39:28,452
Guard, come here a minute.

368
00:39:29,953 --> 00:39:32,456
Don't turn me in, for Christ's sake.
I got Fr 1,000.

369
00:39:32,498 --> 00:39:33,582
I didn't hear you.

370
00:39:33,665 --> 00:39:35,626
I said I got Fr 2,000 on me.

371
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:36,835
Right now.

372
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,295
What's the trouble?

373
00:39:42,883 --> 00:39:44,843
This man just brought me
the finest Morphus...

374
00:39:44,885 --> 00:39:46,011
...I've ever seen.

375
00:39:48,096 --> 00:39:49,640
Why don't you get him a net?

376
00:39:49,765 --> 00:39:50,933
Right away, sir.

377
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:53,727
I want a seaworthy boat, new sails.

378
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:58,148
It'll cost you Fr 4,000, my friend.
Half now, half on delivery.

379
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,608
When will that be?

380
00:39:59,691 --> 00:40:00,984
One week from tonight.

381
00:40:01,109 --> 00:40:02,444
Where will the boat be?

382
00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:04,029
Half a mile down river.

383
00:40:04,655 --> 00:40:06,949
About 300 yards this side of the river...

384
00:40:07,032 --> 00:40:08,492
...there's a big tree.

385
00:40:08,534 --> 00:40:09,535
You can't miss it.

386
00:40:10,118 --> 00:40:11,370
I'll be there.

387
00:40:12,913 --> 00:40:14,748
You bring me the rest of the money.

388
00:40:15,499 --> 00:40:17,209
I'll take you to your boat.

389
00:40:22,756 --> 00:40:24,299
You're a goddamn burglar...

390
00:40:25,259 --> 00:40:26,718
...and that proves it.

391
00:40:49,032 --> 00:40:50,200
Are you asleep?

392
00:40:51,869 --> 00:40:52,870
No.

393
00:40:54,246 --> 00:40:55,455
I've been thinking....

394
00:40:58,292 --> 00:41:00,002
When you decide to go...

395
00:41:02,254 --> 00:41:05,174
...I'd very much appreciate going with you.

396
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,554
What?

397
00:41:15,684 --> 00:41:17,186
-Can you handle a boat?
-No.

398
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:20,856
Well, can you even see a boat
without your glasses?

399
00:41:22,691 --> 00:41:23,775
I can help.

400
00:41:23,859 --> 00:41:26,695
Jesus Christ! You're the one
that didn't want to risk it.

401
00:41:26,862 --> 00:41:27,821
I didn't.

402
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:30,824
Now I have no choice.

403
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:34,953
If I stay here in this place...

404
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:40,209
...I'll die.

405
00:41:45,255 --> 00:41:46,548
Well, it's your money.

406
00:42:03,857 --> 00:42:05,901
You two, I've got a job for you.

407
00:42:05,943 --> 00:42:09,112
You load a stiff into the boat,
you load him right now.

408
00:42:22,668 --> 00:42:23,710
Julot!

409
00:42:30,592 --> 00:42:31,593
Pick him up.

410
00:42:41,895 --> 00:42:42,813
Dega!

411
00:42:44,314 --> 00:42:45,524
Don't puke here!

412
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,818
Hey, Sarge!

413
00:42:48,527 --> 00:42:49,444
Sarge!

414
00:42:50,612 --> 00:42:52,656
He didn't mean it, sir. He's sick.

415
00:42:52,781 --> 00:42:54,700
I'll take care of him.

416
00:42:56,702 --> 00:42:58,412
Stop that, you pig!

417
00:43:12,885 --> 00:43:14,511
You just leave him to me.

418
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:17,222
I'll take care of him, sir.

419
00:43:26,815 --> 00:43:28,233
Stop, you bastard!

420
00:43:52,925 --> 00:43:57,304
Do you realize that the first man
who carved a wheel out of stone...

421
00:43:58,472 --> 00:44:00,349
...used it as an ornament?

422
00:44:03,101 --> 00:44:05,562
I've always admired him for that.

423
00:44:09,775 --> 00:44:11,819
There's one search party that gave up.

424
00:44:18,909 --> 00:44:21,703
Instead of trying to make
the orifice fit the lens...

425
00:44:22,454 --> 00:44:24,790
...l made the lens fit the orifice.

426
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,674
What do you think?
Did he make it or didn't he?

427
00:44:37,261 --> 00:44:40,055
I'd say his chances are very poor,
wouldn't you?

428
00:44:40,305 --> 00:44:43,433
Jesus! Is that all you've got to say?

429
00:44:46,061 --> 00:44:47,980
What do you expect me to say?

430
00:44:48,981 --> 00:44:51,441
That man risked his life to save mine.

431
00:44:54,528 --> 00:44:56,363
For me that's a new experience.

432
00:45:03,829 --> 00:45:06,081
These may work better than I had hoped.

433
00:45:25,893 --> 00:45:27,811
I told you, you couldn't miss it.

434
00:45:31,815 --> 00:45:35,319
The only trouble is, you're a week early.

435
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:40,282
It's up to you.

436
00:45:40,365 --> 00:45:43,035
You're worth just as much dead
as you are alive.

437
00:46:23,867 --> 00:46:25,911
The rule here is total silence.

438
00:46:27,162 --> 00:46:29,081
We make no pretense
of rehabilitation here.

439
00:46:29,122 --> 00:46:31,291
We're not priests, we're processors.

440
00:46:32,918 --> 00:46:36,046
A meatpacker processes live animals
into edible ones.

441
00:46:36,088 --> 00:46:38,841
We process dangerous men
into harmless ones.

442
00:46:40,092 --> 00:46:42,219
This we accomplish by breaking you.

443
00:46:43,095 --> 00:46:46,431
Breaking you physically, spiritually,
and here.

444
00:46:47,933 --> 00:46:52,187
Strange things happen to the head here.
Put all hope out of your mind...

445
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,441
...and masturbate as little as possible.
It drains the strength.

446
00:46:57,234 --> 00:46:58,777
That's all, take him away.

447
00:49:12,202 --> 00:49:13,495
One, two...

448
00:49:13,495 --> 00:49:15,789
...three, four, five.

449
00:49:19,751 --> 00:49:23,714
One, two, three, four, five.

450
00:50:50,008 --> 00:50:51,260
Oh, Jesus!

451
00:50:54,263 --> 00:50:57,850
No. You'll eat everything they give you.

452
00:51:09,111 --> 00:51:10,487
I'm going to be fine.

453
00:51:13,198 --> 00:51:14,449
I'm going to be fine.

454
00:51:14,867 --> 00:51:16,201
I'm going to be fine.

455
00:51:17,452 --> 00:51:20,164
One, two, three, four, five.

456
00:51:59,244 --> 00:52:00,829
I'm Jo-Jo.

457
00:52:01,914 --> 00:52:02,873
Papillon.

458
00:52:04,917 --> 00:52:06,210
How do I look?

459
00:52:06,668 --> 00:52:09,046
I feel pretty good...

460
00:52:09,421 --> 00:52:12,799
...but I need somebody
to tell me how I look.

461
00:52:14,676 --> 00:52:16,512
Fine. You look fine.

462
00:53:10,482 --> 00:53:12,109
"Chew the coconut well...

463
00:53:16,196 --> 00:53:17,823
"...then swallow the pulp.

464
00:53:17,865 --> 00:53:20,409
"One each day, for strength.

465
00:53:21,118 --> 00:53:22,578
"My thoughts are with you.

466
00:53:24,163 --> 00:53:25,164
"Squinter."

467
00:53:25,455 --> 00:53:29,376
Dega. I'll be a son of a bitch! Dega.

468
00:54:22,721 --> 00:54:24,681
I'm still here, you bastards!

469
00:55:37,045 --> 00:55:38,922
Prisoner, show yourself.

470
00:55:53,645 --> 00:55:55,564
You've been receiving coconuts.

471
00:55:56,690 --> 00:56:00,068
Unless you tell us who sent them,
your rations will be cut in half.

472
00:56:02,112 --> 00:56:03,614
Well, how can I tell you...

473
00:56:03,989 --> 00:56:05,866
...who sent me stuff I didn't get?

474
00:56:05,949 --> 00:56:07,075
What stuff?

475
00:56:08,869 --> 00:56:11,413
Well, I don't know.

476
00:56:12,581 --> 00:56:13,624
You...

477
00:56:14,166 --> 00:56:15,667
...you said coconut.

478
00:56:16,418 --> 00:56:18,462
I want that name and I want it now.

479
00:56:23,425 --> 00:56:26,261
Put him on half rations
and screen his cell for six months.

480
00:56:28,847 --> 00:56:31,099
Darkness does wonders for a bad memory.

481
00:57:22,776 --> 00:57:24,403
You know the charge.

482
00:57:25,529 --> 00:57:26,738
I'm innocent.

483
00:57:27,322 --> 00:57:29,074
I didn't kill that pimp.

484
00:57:29,533 --> 00:57:32,494
You couldn't get anything on me
and you framed me.

485
00:57:33,954 --> 00:57:35,539
That is quite true.

486
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:41,336
But your real crime has nothing to do
with a pimp's death.

487
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:44,548
Well then?

488
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:45,924
What is it?

489
00:57:46,258 --> 00:57:51,221
Yours is the most terrible crime
a human being can commit.

490
00:57:52,306 --> 00:57:53,724
I accuse you...

491
00:57:54,892 --> 00:57:56,727
...of a wasted life.

492
00:58:00,439 --> 00:58:01,440
Guilty.

493
00:58:02,941 --> 00:58:05,027
The penalty for that is death.

494
00:58:07,529 --> 00:58:08,572
Guilty.

495
00:58:11,909 --> 00:58:12,910
Guilty.

496
00:58:17,831 --> 00:58:18,832
Guilty.

497
00:59:14,346 --> 00:59:15,389
They know.

498
00:59:40,497 --> 00:59:41,582
How did you hear?

499
00:59:42,332 --> 00:59:45,627
Trusty works on the launch
between here and Saint Joseph.

500
00:59:46,587 --> 00:59:48,255
That's all that he said?

501
00:59:50,841 --> 00:59:52,843
Then it's only a matter of time.

502
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:54,511
You think so?

503
00:59:54,595 --> 00:59:57,055
He's on half rations now.
He can't exist on that.

504
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:01,643
Forced to choose between starvation
and telling, what would you do?

505
01:00:03,353 --> 01:00:06,106
We're not talking about me.
What would you do?

506
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:08,650
I'd tell. I'd have to.

507
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:13,238
You get weak, you get delirious,
you lose control...

508
01:00:15,032 --> 01:00:16,241
...and you talk.

509
01:00:18,202 --> 01:00:19,870
Then you won't blame him, huh?

510
01:00:26,001 --> 01:00:28,504
Blame is for God and small children.

511
01:01:15,968 --> 01:01:18,303
Look at me! I eat bugs!

512
01:01:19,263 --> 01:01:22,891
I don't...l don't have enough sense
to get out of the rain.

513
01:02:25,954 --> 01:02:27,623
Prisoner, show yourself.

514
01:02:48,644 --> 01:02:51,522
Give me the name
and you're back on full rations.

515
01:02:52,731 --> 01:02:53,816
Just one name.

516
01:02:57,110 --> 01:02:59,196
Well, I don't get that hungry.

517
01:03:02,282 --> 01:03:04,952
You'll starve. You should see yourself.

518
01:03:06,078 --> 01:03:07,871
I was born skinny.

519
01:03:11,875 --> 01:03:12,960
Then you'll die.

520
01:04:00,048 --> 01:04:02,426
One, two....

521
01:04:22,112 --> 01:04:23,280
I'm Papillon.

522
01:04:24,323 --> 01:04:25,282
Francisco.

523
01:04:26,492 --> 01:04:27,701
How do I look?

524
01:04:28,952 --> 01:04:30,204
Do I look okay?

525
01:04:30,871 --> 01:04:31,914
You look swell.

526
01:05:15,958 --> 01:05:17,334
That's 30 days more...

527
01:05:17,334 --> 01:05:18,544
...pimp killer!

528
01:05:19,086 --> 01:05:20,587
I want to see the warden.

529
01:05:21,421 --> 01:05:22,422
I want to talk to him.

530
01:05:22,464 --> 01:05:24,383
I have something I want to tell him.

531
01:06:04,214 --> 01:06:05,716
Who gave you the food?

532
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:16,268
I....

533
01:06:18,395 --> 01:06:20,522
Jesus, Warden...

534
01:06:22,024 --> 01:06:23,567
...l had it.

535
01:06:25,694 --> 01:06:28,113
I had the name, honest to God....

536
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:31,992
I must be light--

537
01:06:33,785 --> 01:06:35,621
I must be lightheaded or...

538
01:06:36,413 --> 01:06:37,873
...something because...

539
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,376
...I'm trying.

540
01:06:42,127 --> 01:06:43,128
I'm trying.

541
01:06:44,922 --> 01:06:47,549
I can...l can't remember.

542
01:06:48,217 --> 01:06:49,593
Honest to God, I can't.

543
01:06:49,676 --> 01:06:51,345
I can't, I can't remember.

544
01:06:54,890 --> 01:06:57,684
It's not there, Mr. Prosecutor.

545
01:06:57,935 --> 01:07:00,729
I don't know, it's not, it's not there.

546
01:07:01,313 --> 01:07:02,272
No.

547
01:07:06,443 --> 01:07:07,486
It's gone.

548
01:07:14,535 --> 01:07:15,577
He's dying.

549
01:09:18,325 --> 01:09:21,203
You're dead.

550
01:09:53,235 --> 01:09:54,903
Your term is completed.

551
01:10:38,572 --> 01:10:43,202
One, two, three, four...

552
01:10:43,702 --> 01:10:44,786
...five...

553
01:10:50,542 --> 01:10:51,585
...six.

554
01:10:53,587 --> 01:10:55,756
Oh, you son of a bitch.

555
01:11:09,061 --> 01:11:10,938
Welcome to the Penal Colony...

556
01:11:11,688 --> 01:11:13,065
...of French Guiana...

557
01:11:14,650 --> 01:11:16,401
...whose prisoners you are...

558
01:11:17,069 --> 01:11:19,154
...and from which there is no escape.

559
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:24,952
First attempts at escape...

560
01:11:25,619 --> 01:11:28,622
...add two years in solitary
to existing sentences.

561
01:11:32,459 --> 01:11:34,503
Second attempts, add five more.

562
01:11:37,005 --> 01:11:39,174
Of course, more serious offenses...

563
01:11:39,925 --> 01:11:42,302
...are dealt with in this fashion.

564
01:11:57,401 --> 01:11:58,652
Hello, Papi!

565
01:12:02,823 --> 01:12:05,325
Don't take advantage. I'm in handcuffs.

566
01:12:06,869 --> 01:12:09,413
Make the best of what we offer you...

567
01:12:10,622 --> 01:12:12,916
...and you will suffer less than you deserve.

568
01:12:13,667 --> 01:12:14,501
Dismissed.

569
01:12:18,922 --> 01:12:20,841
Move! In the bunkhouse!

570
01:12:45,282 --> 01:12:47,743
I have hot soup, with real meat in it.

571
01:12:48,494 --> 01:12:50,078
Dega sent it to you.

572
01:13:06,929 --> 01:13:08,180
My name is Maturette.

573
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:26,258
How are you?

574
01:14:27,301 --> 01:14:28,760
Pretty good.

575
01:14:31,138 --> 01:14:34,725
You'd be in much better health, you know,
if you'd given them my name.

576
01:14:35,851 --> 01:14:36,810
I almost did.

577
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:40,856
Someone once said
that temptation resisted...

578
01:14:43,567 --> 01:14:45,569
...is the true measure of character.

579
01:14:48,113 --> 01:14:49,656
How'd you get out of Kilo 40?

580
01:14:50,532 --> 01:14:52,868
It was the rankest sort of corruption.

581
01:14:53,285 --> 01:14:56,538
Suffice it to say the warden
now has a new house...

582
01:14:57,122 --> 01:14:59,041
...and I've become his chief clerk.

583
01:15:00,167 --> 01:15:01,210
Papi, look....

584
01:15:01,710 --> 01:15:03,253
My wife and lawyer...

585
01:15:03,587 --> 01:15:06,757
...have convinced certain members
in the Ministry of Justice...

586
01:15:06,882 --> 01:15:08,759
...that my sentence was a bit harsh.

587
01:15:09,259 --> 01:15:11,094
Some months back I asked them...

588
01:15:11,762 --> 01:15:13,680
...to look into your case...

589
01:15:14,223 --> 01:15:16,391
...and they've made some headway.

590
01:15:16,683 --> 01:15:19,394
One of the principle witnesses
against you...

591
01:15:19,561 --> 01:15:22,064
...may be willing to change his story...

592
01:15:23,106 --> 01:15:24,066
...for a price.

593
01:15:24,525 --> 01:15:26,860
If this happened, when would it be?

594
01:15:27,277 --> 01:15:29,196
You could be out in perhaps three years.

595
01:15:29,571 --> 01:15:31,240
-Too long.
-No, it isn't.

596
01:15:32,074 --> 01:15:34,743
And with a good job,
the time will pass very quickly.

597
01:15:36,161 --> 01:15:37,412
Listen, my friend.

598
01:15:38,622 --> 01:15:39,706
You owe me nothing.

599
01:15:47,297 --> 01:15:48,632
Tell me what you want.

600
01:15:50,259 --> 01:15:51,134
A boat.

601
01:15:57,891 --> 01:15:59,226
I should have known.

602
01:18:17,030 --> 01:18:19,158
Papi, don't you remember me?

603
01:18:20,242 --> 01:18:21,285
Clusiot.

604
01:18:21,535 --> 01:18:22,494
Yeah.

605
01:18:24,329 --> 01:18:25,497
What happened to your eyes?

606
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:32,754
I put some ground-up castor beans in 'em,
so I'd look sick enough to get in here.

607
01:18:33,255 --> 01:18:34,256
Why?

608
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:36,258
I'm going with you.

609
01:18:36,758 --> 01:18:37,426
What?

610
01:18:37,801 --> 01:18:39,052
Yeah. Listen....

611
01:18:40,345 --> 01:18:42,931
Dega's got you on the x-ray list
for tomorrow.

612
01:18:43,599 --> 01:18:47,227
The x-ray doctor, he's a convict.
Some kind of Hindu or something.

613
01:18:47,394 --> 01:18:50,522
He's got somebody on the outside
who can sell you a boat...

614
01:18:51,148 --> 01:18:52,733
...if the price is right.

615
01:18:56,153 --> 01:18:57,613
When do we run, Papi?

616
01:19:02,451 --> 01:19:04,995
Soon. I'll talk to that doctor tomorrow.

617
01:19:15,631 --> 01:19:18,050
The last boat I obtained was
for a sex murderer.

618
01:19:18,634 --> 01:19:21,887
They shot him to pieces
six miles down the river, poor man.

619
01:19:22,679 --> 01:19:24,389
But the boat stood up very well.

620
01:19:25,307 --> 01:19:26,850
You have the heart of an ox.

621
01:19:27,184 --> 01:19:28,227
What kind of a boat?

622
01:19:28,352 --> 01:19:32,981
Fourteen feet, complete with compass,
sails, tools, clothes.

623
01:19:34,566 --> 01:19:37,528
The generator begins. Science takes over!

624
01:19:38,946 --> 01:19:41,990
You know, x-rays are quite worthless.
They always have been.

625
01:19:42,199 --> 01:19:43,784
Lie down, please, on the back.

626
01:19:44,868 --> 01:19:46,453
How much would it cost?

627
01:19:46,537 --> 01:19:49,706
Fr 3,000 in advance, which you pay to me...

628
01:19:49,706 --> 01:19:52,668
...and I pay to Pascal,
who provides everything.

629
01:19:52,918 --> 01:19:55,838
Draw a deep breath, please,
and hold completely still.

630
01:19:56,588 --> 01:20:00,592
Another Fr 3,000 you must pay directly
to Pascal when he delivers the boat.

631
01:20:01,051 --> 01:20:03,011
Exhale, please, and turn over.

632
01:20:04,555 --> 01:20:07,391
If I decide to make a deal,
how do we handle it?

633
01:20:08,517 --> 01:20:10,894
Have no fear. Ways will be found.

634
01:20:12,938 --> 01:20:14,898
Trust me for everything.

635
01:20:15,983 --> 01:20:19,069
The last time I did that
cost me two years in solitary.

636
01:20:19,319 --> 01:20:21,947
So, you have been cheated, eh?

637
01:20:23,031 --> 01:20:25,492
Well, happily for you,
money doesn't tempt me.

638
01:20:25,617 --> 01:20:28,120
I'm after bigger game.
Draw a deep breath.

639
01:20:30,122 --> 01:20:31,165
You see...

640
01:20:31,707 --> 01:20:33,542
...l killed my whole family.

641
01:20:34,084 --> 01:20:37,087
All of them. My wife and four little ones.

642
01:20:38,755 --> 01:20:40,841
Exhale, if you haven't already.

643
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:46,096
You double-cross me, I'll kill ya.

644
01:20:47,222 --> 01:20:48,348
Of course...

645
01:20:49,766 --> 01:20:51,768
...l would consider that a favor.

646
01:20:52,436 --> 01:20:54,062
A very great favor.

647
01:21:14,666 --> 01:21:17,920
One of these nights I might ask you
to take that Turnkey into the toilet.

648
01:21:17,961 --> 01:21:21,048
Show him a good time.
When you come out you'll get Fr 1,000.

649
01:21:23,467 --> 01:21:24,510
Why?

650
01:21:25,636 --> 01:21:29,097
That's my business. Your business is
to make him happy for ten minutes.

651
01:21:29,973 --> 01:21:31,016
Fr 1,000.

652
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:33,143
He's filthy.

653
01:21:33,769 --> 01:21:36,188
All right, Fr 2,000.
Does that make him any cleaner?

654
01:21:42,277 --> 01:21:43,695
You think I'm a whore, don't you?

655
01:21:43,862 --> 01:21:44,696
Easy.

656
01:21:44,822 --> 01:21:46,114
Well, you're wrong.

657
01:21:47,324 --> 01:21:48,367
Next.

658
01:23:11,366 --> 01:23:13,535
I'll do what you ask, on one condition:

659
01:23:14,870 --> 01:23:17,414
You keep your money
and you take me with you.

660
01:23:18,457 --> 01:23:19,333
No.

661
01:23:19,458 --> 01:23:21,835
I'm the only one
who can get you out of here.

662
01:23:29,676 --> 01:23:31,011
-You're--
-I know.

663
01:23:31,762 --> 01:23:35,724
I'm a queer, a fairy, a pouf, huh?

664
01:23:38,227 --> 01:23:40,229
But there's one thing you forgot.

665
01:23:40,813 --> 01:23:43,357
You may have been framed,
as you say you were...

666
01:23:43,982 --> 01:23:45,234
...but I wasn't.

667
01:23:45,651 --> 01:23:47,361
Between the two of us...

668
01:23:48,070 --> 01:23:50,906
...I'm the one who's killed a man, not you.

669
01:23:56,370 --> 01:23:57,412
Okay.

670
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:43,917
It's tonight during the concert.

671
01:24:45,169 --> 01:24:48,380
I'll be there. I have to.
I'm serving refreshments.

672
01:24:50,466 --> 01:24:52,259
I think you ought to go with us, Louis.

673
01:24:52,342 --> 01:24:53,927
-You ought to.
-Thank you.

674
01:24:55,179 --> 01:24:57,264
But my wife is arranging for my release.

675
01:24:57,389 --> 01:24:59,016
The letter from her is overdue.

676
01:25:03,103 --> 01:25:04,104
Listen to me.

677
01:25:05,856 --> 01:25:09,109
If your wife was here and you were in Paris
with all that money...

678
01:25:09,193 --> 01:25:10,986
...how much would you pay
to get her back?

679
01:25:11,987 --> 01:25:13,405
Everything I have.

680
01:25:15,616 --> 01:25:18,410
And how much would she pay
to get you back?

681
01:25:24,208 --> 01:25:25,834
That's why you should run.

682
01:25:26,877 --> 01:25:29,213
Now, Louis, while you've got a chance.

683
01:25:29,588 --> 01:25:31,507
But I have a chance without running.

684
01:25:35,344 --> 01:25:36,678
Me, they can kill...

685
01:25:37,888 --> 01:25:39,223
...you, they own.

686
01:25:44,311 --> 01:25:45,270
Goodbye.

687
01:25:46,438 --> 01:25:47,523
Good luck.

688
01:30:57,457 --> 01:30:58,292
Clusiot!

689
01:31:14,349 --> 01:31:15,267
Clusiot!

690
01:31:19,104 --> 01:31:20,105
Halt!

691
01:31:30,574 --> 01:31:33,160
Dega, you bastard!

692
01:31:34,203 --> 01:31:35,537
-Guard!
-Shut up!

693
01:31:36,163 --> 01:31:37,206
Guard!

694
01:31:39,416 --> 01:31:40,501
Guard!

695
01:31:41,752 --> 01:31:42,711
Guard!

696
01:31:45,756 --> 01:31:46,757
Pull!

697
01:31:47,758 --> 01:31:48,759
Pull!

698
01:31:51,303 --> 01:31:52,304
Pull!

699
01:32:11,740 --> 01:32:12,616
Let's go.

700
01:32:13,408 --> 01:32:14,493
Where's Clusiot?

701
01:32:14,660 --> 01:32:15,661
A guard got him.

702
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:16,703
Let's go.

703
01:32:32,427 --> 01:32:33,470
Here! Here!

704
01:32:33,762 --> 01:32:35,806
-Where's the other one?
-Right here.

705
01:32:35,848 --> 01:32:37,266
Just a little twist.

706
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:39,560
Come on, come on.

707
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:25,022
There's your boat over there.

708
01:33:27,107 --> 01:33:28,066
Fr 3,000.

709
01:33:35,032 --> 01:33:36,867
You'd better check her out,
see if she's okay.

710
01:33:36,909 --> 01:33:38,285
Come on. I'm in a hurry.

711
01:33:38,869 --> 01:33:40,204
Let's go! Let's go!

712
01:33:42,873 --> 01:33:46,710
I wouldn't use those guns if you don't want
the man hunters down on you.

713
01:33:48,086 --> 01:33:50,005
I put two gallons of rum aboard.

714
01:33:51,006 --> 01:33:53,425
Send me a postcard
when you get to Honduras.

715
01:34:11,568 --> 01:34:12,653
Let's have a drink of that rum.

716
01:34:24,665 --> 01:34:25,624
Why, this...

717
01:34:26,708 --> 01:34:28,418
...goddamn boat's no good.

718
01:34:28,627 --> 01:34:30,963
Look at it! I'll kill that bastard!

719
01:34:31,380 --> 01:34:33,340
The son of a bitch is made of kindling.

720
01:34:33,423 --> 01:34:34,591
So is my leg.

721
01:34:36,927 --> 01:34:39,179
I didn't twist my ankle, I fractured it.

722
01:34:39,263 --> 01:34:40,556
You broke your leg?

723
01:34:41,265 --> 01:34:42,641
Why didn't you say something?

724
01:34:42,724 --> 01:34:45,269
I had the unworthy suspicion
you might leave me behind.

725
01:34:45,269 --> 01:34:46,937
You're goddamn right I would have.

726
01:34:47,020 --> 01:34:48,063
It's broken, all right.

727
01:34:48,105 --> 01:34:49,231
We've got to set this.

728
01:34:49,273 --> 01:34:50,315
I need your help.

729
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:51,775
I presume it'll be painful.

730
01:34:51,817 --> 01:34:52,985
You bet it will.

731
01:34:53,569 --> 01:34:56,613
I ask you to remember that
that's my money that's sinking...

732
01:34:56,655 --> 01:34:59,158
...and that I'm here out of an act
of unnatural heroism...

733
01:34:59,283 --> 01:35:01,118
...which prevented a guard
from shooting you.

734
01:35:01,160 --> 01:35:03,453
He probably would have
missed me anyway.

735
01:35:03,871 --> 01:35:04,705
Now relax.

736
01:35:04,830 --> 01:35:05,831
-What?
-Relax.

737
01:35:05,914 --> 01:35:08,041
You're at the wrong end.

738
01:35:12,087 --> 01:35:13,464
It'll only last a couple minutes.

739
01:35:19,094 --> 01:35:20,971
-Jesus!
-Hold him above the knee.

740
01:35:22,723 --> 01:35:23,765
Ready?

741
01:35:31,356 --> 01:35:32,608
That finishes it.

742
01:35:33,066 --> 01:35:34,443
How'd you do that?

743
01:35:35,611 --> 01:35:37,446
We've all got our sensitive spots.

744
01:35:37,738 --> 01:35:38,989
What happened?

745
01:35:39,198 --> 01:35:41,074
He found a sensitive spot
you didn't know you had.

746
01:36:01,011 --> 01:36:02,387
Move and you're dead.

747
01:36:04,139 --> 01:36:05,474
Turn around.

748
01:36:06,683 --> 01:36:08,685
Throw that gun out in front of you.

749
01:36:11,730 --> 01:36:13,816
You know I get Fr 200 for one of these.

750
01:36:14,191 --> 01:36:15,818
I wouldn't want to lose it.

751
01:36:16,109 --> 01:36:17,361
Turn around.

752
01:36:20,948 --> 01:36:24,201
You and two others broke out
of Saint Laurent last night, didn't you?

753
01:36:24,243 --> 01:36:25,160
That's right.

754
01:36:25,410 --> 01:36:26,495
The others are at the boat?

755
01:36:27,329 --> 01:36:28,288
That's right.

756
01:36:28,330 --> 01:36:29,540
And the boat's no good.

757
01:36:29,748 --> 01:36:30,833
Not worth a damn.

758
01:36:32,751 --> 01:36:33,794
Been expecting you.

759
01:36:41,301 --> 01:36:42,386
Come on.

760
01:36:49,226 --> 01:36:51,228
Don't shoot. It's okay.

761
01:36:56,817 --> 01:36:59,903
Caught these two man hunters asleep
just before sunup.

762
01:37:00,154 --> 01:37:02,322
They've been hanging around
for two days waiting on ya.

763
01:37:04,324 --> 01:37:07,578
Each time he sells that boat,
it's in worse shape than the last time.

764
01:37:11,331 --> 01:37:12,374
You like this?

765
01:37:13,625 --> 01:37:14,877
Oh, very much.

766
01:37:15,502 --> 01:37:17,796
I did too, at the time, but I was drunk.

767
01:37:19,047 --> 01:37:20,549
Here, take this.

768
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:23,343
Cut yourself some bamboo
from around here...

769
01:37:23,385 --> 01:37:27,055
...and lash it together with sailcloth.
I'll be back around sunset.

770
01:37:29,892 --> 01:37:32,394
I'll tow you up river to Pigeon Island.

771
01:37:33,645 --> 01:37:36,398
You can get a boat there,
if you've got enough money.

772
01:37:37,357 --> 01:37:40,486
If you haven't got enough money
they'll probably kill ya.

773
01:37:40,736 --> 01:37:42,988
It doesn't matter much to them.
They're all lepers.

774
01:38:30,661 --> 01:38:32,079
Noisy son of a bitch.

775
01:38:33,288 --> 01:38:34,706
Do dogs carry leprosy?

776
01:38:47,845 --> 01:38:48,846
Well...

777
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:50,889
...the hell with it.

778
01:38:50,973 --> 01:38:52,432
You better take this--

779
01:38:55,811 --> 01:38:57,646
I don't want to fight these people.

780
01:38:57,688 --> 01:39:00,274
I just want to try to talk them
out of a boat.

781
01:39:48,489 --> 01:39:49,656
Who are you?

782
01:39:53,285 --> 01:39:54,745
Escaped prisoner, Papillon.

783
01:39:55,996 --> 01:39:57,456
Where are the other two?

784
01:39:57,998 --> 01:39:59,583
They're down on the beach.

785
01:40:00,250 --> 01:40:01,710
One's got a broken ankle.

786
01:40:03,003 --> 01:40:03,712
Come in.

787
01:40:48,257 --> 01:40:49,716
You have two rifles.

788
01:40:50,300 --> 01:40:51,218
That's right.

789
01:40:51,260 --> 01:40:52,970
And you want a boat.

790
01:40:54,513 --> 01:40:55,597
That's right.

791
01:40:55,639 --> 01:40:57,307
But you're short of money.

792
01:40:59,601 --> 01:41:00,853
That's right, too.

793
01:41:02,938 --> 01:41:05,941
Why don't you have the courtesy
to look at me when you speak?

794
01:41:18,203 --> 01:41:22,624
We do a lot of smuggling here.
We raid the mainland. We steal boats.

795
01:41:23,959 --> 01:41:25,836
When an outsider comes in...

796
01:41:25,836 --> 01:41:28,714
...we generally kill him,
as a security measure.

797
01:41:30,716 --> 01:41:32,176
That makes sense.

798
01:41:33,093 --> 01:41:34,094
Well...

799
01:41:35,012 --> 01:41:37,306
...a man of Christian understanding.

800
01:41:39,391 --> 01:41:40,809
Do you like cigars?

801
01:41:42,144 --> 01:41:43,145
When I can get 'em.

802
01:41:46,607 --> 01:41:47,858
Try this one.

803
01:42:19,014 --> 01:42:23,018
How did you know I have dry leprosy,
that it isn't contagious?

804
01:42:26,104 --> 01:42:27,272
I didn't.

805
01:42:53,757 --> 01:42:56,760
In normal weather you should
sight Honduras in three and a half...

806
01:42:56,844 --> 01:42:57,845
...maybe four weeks.

807
01:42:59,263 --> 01:43:01,515
When you get there,
you'll need some money.

808
01:43:01,765 --> 01:43:02,850
We passed the hat.

809
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:06,478
Take it, it's disinfected.

810
01:43:09,606 --> 01:43:14,278
If you're going to catch leprosy, it's better
to catch it from money than from people.

811
01:43:18,448 --> 01:43:19,408
Take it.

812
01:43:23,162 --> 01:43:25,080
All we use it for is gambling...

813
01:43:26,123 --> 01:43:28,584
...bringing in women lepers from Albina.

814
01:43:30,127 --> 01:43:32,129
We've always got enough for that.

815
01:43:38,927 --> 01:43:41,847
Hurry up. Get on board,
you'll miss the tide.

816
01:43:56,487 --> 01:43:57,488
Goodbye.

817
01:44:34,608 --> 01:44:35,609
Honduras.

818
01:45:00,134 --> 01:45:02,594
My leg! Get it off my leg!

819
01:45:03,220 --> 01:45:04,721
It's on my leg!

820
01:45:04,763 --> 01:45:06,306
Goddamn it!

821
01:46:07,075 --> 01:46:08,494
All right, come on.

822
01:46:08,827 --> 01:46:09,745
Come on, one more.

823
01:46:09,828 --> 01:46:12,581
-I'm already so drunk I can't think.
-Yeah.

824
01:46:13,624 --> 01:46:15,042
That's what I want.

825
01:46:19,379 --> 01:46:21,840
I want you to put this between your teeth.

826
01:46:24,343 --> 01:46:26,261
It's going to hurt you, Louis.

827
01:46:29,348 --> 01:46:32,100
If you want to yell, yell.

828
01:46:32,267 --> 01:46:33,602
I certainly will.

829
01:47:04,216 --> 01:47:06,051
-I fooled you.
-What?

830
01:47:09,346 --> 01:47:10,931
I fooled you, didn't l?

831
01:48:29,802 --> 01:48:31,386
One moment, please, seores.

832
01:48:31,428 --> 01:48:32,930
What do you want, Sergeant?

833
01:48:33,388 --> 01:48:36,099
Identification. Who are you?

834
01:48:36,683 --> 01:48:39,353
We're fishermen. Our friend here--

835
01:48:51,323 --> 01:48:52,741
Goddamn it, we...

836
01:48:53,033 --> 01:48:54,034
...we made it!

837
01:49:22,646 --> 01:49:23,689
Amigo.

838
01:49:30,487 --> 01:49:31,530
Por favor.

839
01:49:31,864 --> 01:49:34,741
Those bastards trussed me up like a pig.

840
01:51:49,293 --> 01:51:50,377
Trackers!

841
02:03:37,167 --> 02:03:39,002
Show your papers, please.

842
02:04:05,028 --> 02:04:06,155
Por favor.

843
02:04:07,865 --> 02:04:08,866
Seor...

844
02:04:11,076 --> 02:04:12,453
Dinero, por favor.

845
02:05:13,764 --> 02:05:14,807
What was your crime?

846
02:05:17,309 --> 02:05:18,060
Murder.

847
02:05:19,645 --> 02:05:22,231
I wasn't guilty.
I've never killed anybody in my life.

848
02:05:23,982 --> 02:05:26,860
If you did regain your freedom,
what would you do with it?

849
02:05:29,196 --> 02:05:31,406
I haven't had much time
to think about that.

850
02:05:31,740 --> 02:05:34,910
If you are a thief or a murderer,
by morning...

851
02:05:35,494 --> 02:05:37,412
...you might have stolen
everything we have.

852
02:05:43,544 --> 02:05:46,130
These are mine. They were a gift.

853
02:05:47,548 --> 02:05:49,508
You keep 'em, until I leave.

854
02:06:08,569 --> 02:06:09,987
Are you awake?

855
02:06:10,362 --> 02:06:11,613
Yes, ma'am.

856
02:06:28,130 --> 02:06:32,551
If you are sinful, you have made amends
by feeding half the poor in Santa Marta.

857
02:06:33,135 --> 02:06:35,762
If you are truly not sinful,
you have nothing to fear.

858
02:06:36,472 --> 02:06:38,140
God will watch over you.

859
02:07:54,341 --> 02:07:57,302
Your five years in solitary confinement
are at an end.

860
02:07:58,804 --> 02:08:00,931
You've paid part of your debt to France.

861
02:08:52,983 --> 02:08:53,984
Papi.

862
02:09:05,329 --> 02:09:06,288
I'm free.

863
02:10:46,722 --> 02:10:48,891
That's the only way off Devil's Island.

864
02:10:52,895 --> 02:10:54,938
We try to take things easy here.

865
02:10:56,857 --> 02:10:59,193
The sharks and the tide do
the real guard work...

866
02:10:59,234 --> 02:11:01,320
...so it's live and let live...

867
02:11:02,362 --> 02:11:04,198
...unless you make trouble.

868
02:11:08,494 --> 02:11:10,746
That one's empty.
You might as well take it.

869
02:11:10,871 --> 02:11:12,915
But watch yourself around the other huts.

870
02:11:12,998 --> 02:11:14,875
Someone might take you for a poacher
and kill you.

871
02:11:57,876 --> 02:12:00,003
How dare you sit there!

872
02:12:00,546 --> 02:12:02,923
This bench belongs to Captain Dreyfus!

873
02:12:03,549 --> 02:12:05,801
Who are you to sit on that bench?

874
02:12:07,344 --> 02:12:08,262
Nobody.

875
02:12:08,846 --> 02:12:11,014
That's right. Nobody.

876
02:12:12,641 --> 02:12:14,226
Do you know who I am?

877
02:12:40,419 --> 02:12:41,378
Dega?

878
02:12:48,760 --> 02:12:49,678
Dega!

879
02:12:55,601 --> 02:12:56,643
Dega.

880
02:13:07,404 --> 02:13:08,405
Dega!

881
02:13:29,468 --> 02:13:30,302
Louis.

882
02:13:34,723 --> 02:13:35,724
Louis.

883
02:13:41,104 --> 02:13:43,023
I wish you hadn't come here.

884
02:13:53,784 --> 02:13:55,619
Are you fond of crayfish?

885
02:14:27,359 --> 02:14:28,360
Good.

886
02:14:30,320 --> 02:14:31,989
You really think so?

887
02:14:32,573 --> 02:14:34,783
Best I've had in years.

888
02:14:41,707 --> 02:14:43,125
Did you hear about my wife?

889
02:14:44,918 --> 02:14:48,672
She married my attorney,
or else he married her...

890
02:14:49,173 --> 02:14:52,009
...although actually,
it doesn't really matter.

891
02:14:52,676 --> 02:14:56,263
I mean, it all works out to the same thing,
don't you think?

892
02:15:03,145 --> 02:15:06,523
Well, I have not heard from her in about--

893
02:15:09,276 --> 02:15:10,944
It is nice here, isn't it?

894
02:15:12,654 --> 02:15:14,573
You've made it nice, Louis.

895
02:15:16,617 --> 02:15:17,743
Really nice.

896
02:15:21,413 --> 02:15:22,623
It's funny...

897
02:15:24,208 --> 02:15:26,084
...you and me ending up here.

898
02:15:28,337 --> 02:15:29,963
We're the only ones left.

899
02:15:33,759 --> 02:15:34,968
Do you ever wonder about it?

900
02:15:35,385 --> 02:15:36,345
No.

901
02:15:38,639 --> 02:15:39,681
I do.

902
02:15:43,227 --> 02:15:44,228
Get away!

903
02:15:47,022 --> 02:15:49,024
Get away! Get away!

904
02:15:50,442 --> 02:15:51,568
That's enough!

905
02:16:04,081 --> 02:16:06,375
They come in, steal from my garden.

906
02:16:06,667 --> 02:16:07,709
Who does?

907
02:16:13,674 --> 02:16:14,883
Maybe I'd better go.

908
02:16:15,384 --> 02:16:16,218
Yes.

909
02:16:20,222 --> 02:16:22,975
I know your house. There's no ghost in it.

910
02:16:59,428 --> 02:17:01,221
My thoughts are with you.

911
02:17:30,167 --> 02:17:31,126
Jesus!

912
02:18:02,241 --> 02:18:04,034
Louis!

913
02:18:05,035 --> 02:18:08,497
Come look. Remember those seeds
that Sergeant Santini gave me last month?

914
02:18:08,580 --> 02:18:09,456
They've come up.

915
02:18:09,540 --> 02:18:10,791
We'll have carrots.

916
02:18:10,874 --> 02:18:13,752
It said six weeks on the packet
but it's only taken four.

917
02:18:13,836 --> 02:18:17,506
If I could find a way to get off this island,
would you like to come with me?

918
02:18:17,673 --> 02:18:19,049
Oh, yes, of course.

919
02:18:19,133 --> 02:18:21,677
Get away!
Freddie, you know better than that.

920
02:18:24,138 --> 02:18:25,806
I've got no money. They took it all.

921
02:18:25,889 --> 02:18:27,182
Forget about that.

922
02:18:27,307 --> 02:18:28,809
You can't buy your way out of here.

923
02:18:28,851 --> 02:18:29,643
Then how?

924
02:18:31,895 --> 02:18:32,980
I don't know yet.

925
02:18:33,272 --> 02:18:36,692
Then, then we don't have to discuss it.
Tell me, do you like tomatoes?

926
02:18:36,984 --> 02:18:40,404
I have some extra seeds.
You might like to start your own garden.

927
02:19:05,596 --> 02:19:07,347
You see, it's a horseshoe.

928
02:19:09,099 --> 02:19:11,935
When the waves break
they have no place else to go...

929
02:19:12,060 --> 02:19:13,854
...except go back out again.

930
02:19:14,104 --> 02:19:16,440
Well, you can't launch a boat from here.

931
02:19:17,483 --> 02:19:20,986
In fact, there's no place on the entire island
where you can launch a boat.

932
02:19:21,445 --> 02:19:24,364
Bags of coconuts tied together,
just throw 'em over...

933
02:19:25,783 --> 02:19:27,451
...float out on a wave.

934
02:19:29,411 --> 02:19:31,079
Then what happens?

935
02:19:31,747 --> 02:19:35,501
The mainland's only 24 miles.
You just drift with the current.

936
02:19:38,754 --> 02:19:40,047
Only two days.

937
02:19:40,714 --> 02:19:42,257
-You're certain?
-Yeah.

938
02:19:44,760 --> 02:19:47,763
It seems so, so desperate.

939
02:19:49,097 --> 02:19:50,057
Yeah.

940
02:19:51,809 --> 02:19:52,935
You think it will work?

941
02:19:54,895 --> 02:19:56,188
Does it matter?

942
02:20:02,945 --> 02:20:05,405
Get! Now, that's not yours.

943
02:20:05,989 --> 02:20:07,157
Now, you get away.

944
02:20:07,241 --> 02:20:10,285
I'm not going to tell you again.
Here you are, Freddie.

945
02:20:10,619 --> 02:20:12,704
Freddie's not feeling well today and...

946
02:20:12,788 --> 02:20:14,748
...you should appreciate that fact.

947
02:20:15,707 --> 02:20:16,792
Here we are.

948
02:20:19,795 --> 02:20:20,921
Okay, little one.

949
02:20:21,255 --> 02:20:21,964
All right.

950
02:20:24,633 --> 02:20:25,634
Freddie!

951
02:20:26,844 --> 02:20:29,221
Freddie, that's not for you, that's Adam's.

952
02:20:29,805 --> 02:20:31,140
Come here, Adam.

953
02:20:33,058 --> 02:20:34,059
Let's take a walk.

954
02:20:34,143 --> 02:20:37,146
Certainly. Isn't that a little small?

955
02:20:38,939 --> 02:20:41,191
-It's just to try it with.
-Certainly.

956
02:20:43,360 --> 02:20:46,321
You know, I've been thinking
of building a porch.

957
02:20:47,614 --> 02:20:50,534
There's not a home on the entire island
with a porch.

958
02:20:51,702 --> 02:20:54,163
Not even Sergeant Santini has a porch.

959
02:20:54,705 --> 02:20:57,374
-What do you think, huh?
-Come on.

960
02:23:24,897 --> 02:23:26,398
It was the wrong wave.

961
02:23:28,358 --> 02:23:29,359
Oh, yeah.

962
02:23:31,320 --> 02:23:33,363
They come in a series of seven.

963
02:23:33,781 --> 02:23:35,783
And the seventh wave is big enough...

964
02:23:36,200 --> 02:23:38,660
...to take us both out
beyond the point of return.

965
02:23:41,413 --> 02:23:42,414
Are you certain?

966
02:23:42,581 --> 02:23:43,624
Yeah.

967
02:23:45,167 --> 02:23:46,126
Excellent.

968
02:23:51,381 --> 02:23:54,218
Oh, if we're going
I'd better pick those carrots.

969
02:24:09,733 --> 02:24:11,068
Fourth wave.

970
02:24:21,036 --> 02:24:21,954
Ready?

971
02:24:22,871 --> 02:24:24,456
I must tell you something.

972
02:24:25,415 --> 02:24:28,460
Louis, you don't have to say anything.

973
02:24:30,003 --> 02:24:31,088
I meant to.

974
02:24:33,132 --> 02:24:34,091
I'm sorry.

975
02:24:36,301 --> 02:24:37,302
I know.

976
02:24:41,557 --> 02:24:42,891
You'll be killed.

977
02:24:43,892 --> 02:24:45,018
You know that?

978
02:24:46,311 --> 02:24:47,187
Maybe.

979
02:24:48,605 --> 02:24:50,190
Please, don't do it.

980
02:27:34,104 --> 02:27:37,232
Hey, you bastards, I'm still here!

981
02:27:50,454 --> 02:27:52,372
Papillon made it to freedom.

982
02:27:53,707 --> 02:27:57,377
And for the remaining years of his life
he lived a free man.

983
02:28:00,130 --> 02:28:03,091
This, the infamous penal system
in French Guiana...

984
02:28:04,051 --> 02:28:05,385
...did not survive him.
