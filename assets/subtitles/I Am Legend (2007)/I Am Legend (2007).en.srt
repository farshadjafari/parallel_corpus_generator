1
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:06,224
<i>MAN 1: Spring training camp and
he's definitely got the inside track.</i>

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,994
<i>Word is that they're having
some problems with injuries.</i>

3
00:00:09,169 --> 00:00:10,727
<i>MAN 2:
Really? Are they looking into...</i>

4
00:00:10,904 --> 00:00:13,236
<i>... free-agent signings last second,
anything like that?</i>

5
00:00:13,407 --> 00:00:15,739
<i>MAN 1: Possibly, and they've got
a strong farm club too.</i>

6
00:00:15,909 --> 00:00:18,776
<i>They've got some triple-A ballplayers
they might bring up.</i>

7
00:00:18,945 --> 00:00:21,573
<i>Peter would certainly be able
to tell us more about that.</i>

8
00:00:21,748 --> 00:00:23,113
<i>MAN 2:
Who do you like?</i>

9
00:00:23,283 --> 00:00:25,581
<i>MAN 1: So far,
I like what I'm seeing in New York.</i>

10
00:00:25,752 --> 00:00:28,846
<i>They've got a strong ball club, as usual.
That's in the American.</i>

11
00:00:29,022 --> 00:00:31,616
<i>And in the National,
I'm still liking Chicago...</i>

12
00:00:31,792 --> 00:00:34,226
<i>... with a little bit of a twist here
for Los Angeles.</i>

13
00:00:34,394 --> 00:00:37,261
<i>MAN 2: Okay, so we're looking at
New York-Chicago World Series...</i>

14
00:00:37,431 --> 00:00:40,025
<i>- ... possible Los Angeles.
MAN 1: Could be a dark horse.</i>

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,100
<i>MAN 2: Hold him to it
at the end of the season.</i>

16
00:00:42,269 --> 00:00:44,396
<i>That's gonna do it for us
from the Sports Desk.</i>

17
00:00:44,571 --> 00:00:47,438
<i>- Back to the studio. Thanks, Dave.
MAN 1: Thanks for nothing, Eddie.</i>

18
00:00:47,607 --> 00:00:52,237
<i>MAN 3: Thank you, guys. That's not all we're
following. Here's Karen at the Health Desk.</i>

19
00:00:52,913 --> 00:00:55,848
The world of medicine
has seen its share of miracle cures...

20
00:00:56,016 --> 00:00:58,644
...from the polio vaccine
to heart transplants...

21
00:00:58,819 --> 00:01:03,916
...but all past achievements may pale in
comparison to the work of Dr. Alice Krippin.

22
00:01:04,091 --> 00:01:05,922
Thank you for joining us this morning.

23
00:01:06,093 --> 00:01:10,928
- Not at all.
- So, Dr. Krippin, give it to me in a nutshell.

24
00:01:11,098 --> 00:01:13,794
Well, the premise is quite simple.

25
00:01:13,967 --> 00:01:17,334
Take something designed by nature
and reprogram it...

26
00:01:17,504 --> 00:01:20,803
...to make it work for the body
rather than against it.

27
00:01:20,974 --> 00:01:22,601
- We're talking about a virus?
- Yes.

28
00:01:22,776 --> 00:01:24,573
In this case, the measles virus...

29
00:01:24,745 --> 00:01:29,910
...which has been engineered at a genetic
level to be helpful rather than harmful.

30
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:33,382
Um, I'm not... I find the best way
to describe it is...

31
00:01:33,553 --> 00:01:36,044
...if you can imagine your body
as a highway...

32
00:01:36,223 --> 00:01:41,092
...and you picture the virus as a very fast
car being driven by a very bad man...

33
00:01:41,261 --> 00:01:44,287
...imagine the damage that
that car could cause.

34
00:01:44,464 --> 00:01:47,763
But then if you replace that man
with a cop...

35
00:01:47,934 --> 00:01:51,267
...the picture changes. And that's
essentially what we've done.

36
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:53,736
Now, how many people
have you treated so far?

37
00:01:53,907 --> 00:01:57,536
Well, we've had 10,009 clinical trials
in humans so far.

38
00:01:57,711 --> 00:02:01,442
- And how many are cancer-free?
- Ten thousand and nine.

39
00:02:01,615 --> 00:02:04,743
So you have actually cured cancer?

40
00:02:04,918 --> 00:02:08,581
Yes, yes. Yes, we have.

41
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,368
What you see? What you see?

42
00:04:47,213 --> 00:04:48,612
Damn.

43
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:37,777
Let's go, Sam.

44
00:07:39,719 --> 00:07:41,209
Come on.

45
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,518
<i>Good morning, Matt.
It's looking great, I'll tell you.</i>

46
00:08:53,693 --> 00:08:57,060
<i>Not only was this the biggest
snowstorm in New York City history...</i>

47
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,597
<i>... it had to be one of the prettiest.
Imagine waking up on Sunday...</i>

48
00:09:00,767 --> 00:09:04,066
<i>... to 26.9 inches of snow
in New York City.</i>

49
00:09:04,237 --> 00:09:06,535
ROBERT:
Here you go. Just the way you like it.

50
00:09:06,873 --> 00:09:08,773
Disgusting.

51
00:09:09,609 --> 00:09:12,203
Excuse me, excuse me.

52
00:09:13,213 --> 00:09:16,307
All right. Come on, relax.

53
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:19,746
<i>CURRY However, it did strand
planes, trains and automobiles.</i>

54
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:24,185
<i>There was a report, a Turkish Airlines
flight skidded off the runway at JFK.</i>

55
00:09:24,357 --> 00:09:27,155
<i>No one was injured,
but for the most part, Matt...</i>

56
00:09:27,327 --> 00:09:29,318
There you go.

57
00:09:31,464 --> 00:09:34,865
<i>I'm gonna show you, attempting
the Bob Hager rule of thumb here.</i>

58
00:09:35,301 --> 00:09:37,531
<i>And I'm gonna plug my ruler in.</i>

59
00:09:37,704 --> 00:09:42,607
<i>In New York, in 30 Rock,
we have 16 inches of snow, Matt.</i>

60
00:09:42,775 --> 00:09:44,174
<i>Back to you, Matt and Katie.</i>

61
00:09:44,344 --> 00:09:48,747
<i>Gosh. All right, it looks great. It'll be
beautiful for the next day, at least.</i>

62
00:09:48,915 --> 00:09:50,780
<i>- And then it turns brown.
COURIC: If that.</i>

63
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,508
<i>Anyway, Ann, thanks so much.</i>

64
00:09:52,685 --> 00:09:56,143
Mm-mm. No, no, no. Eat your vegetables.

65
00:09:56,322 --> 00:09:59,416
Don't just push them around, eat them.
I'm not playing.

66
00:09:59,592 --> 00:10:02,060
<i>WOMAN: Good morning. This morning,
all up the East Coast...</i>

67
00:10:02,228 --> 00:10:06,096
Okay. You gonna eat your vegetables.
We will sit down here all night.

68
00:10:06,266 --> 00:10:09,167
<i>The biggest challenge
is getting back to work.</i>

69
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:14,601
What are you whining about?
Why didn't you just eat your vegetables?

70
00:10:15,275 --> 00:10:17,573
Hey. All right, here's the deal.
Look. Look.

71
00:10:17,744 --> 00:10:21,510
You're gonna eat twice as many vegetables
tomorrow night. All right?

72
00:10:21,681 --> 00:10:24,673
Deal? Deal?

73
00:10:29,522 --> 00:10:31,046
Come on.

74
00:10:34,494 --> 00:10:39,022
<i>ROBERT Don't worry
About a thing</i>

75
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,266
<i>'Cause every little thing
Gonna be all right</i>

76
00:10:46,372 --> 00:10:48,636
I know that feels good.

77
00:10:50,176 --> 00:10:54,340
<i>Smiled with the rising sun
Three little birds</i>

78
00:10:54,514 --> 00:10:56,744
Ah, Sam.

79
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:02,752
<i>Singin' sweet songs
Of melody...</i>

80
00:11:32,185 --> 00:11:33,743
I'm all right.

81
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,888
I'm all right, it's all right.

82
00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:07,008
What's happening? I tried to reach you
on your cell. I get a recording.

83
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,943
- Cell service is down.
- Where are we going?

84
00:13:09,115 --> 00:13:11,675
- Can't get used to the new regs.
ROBERT: Going to Aunt Sara's.

85
00:13:11,851 --> 00:13:15,582
- Ma! No! Why?
- Baby, just strap yourself in. Go.

86
00:13:15,755 --> 00:13:18,747
MAN: We're at 30 minutes, colonel.
- Copy.

87
00:13:19,325 --> 00:13:22,658
- Thirty minutes to what?
- They're sealing off the island.

88
00:13:28,434 --> 00:13:31,767
- Seal off the island? This island?
- But I don't wanna go to Aunt Sara's.

89
00:13:31,938 --> 00:13:33,769
ROBERT: Did you bring all the money?
ZOE: Yeah.

90
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,271
ROBERT: How much?
ZOE: Six hundred.

91
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:36,703
Why did you say, "You're going"?

92
00:13:36,876 --> 00:13:38,241
ROBERT: That's not enough.
- Robert.

93
00:13:38,411 --> 00:13:40,345
You said, "You're going,"
not, "We're going."

94
00:13:40,513 --> 00:13:44,415
When you get across, I need you to get
to the ATM. Get as much cash as you can.

95
00:13:44,584 --> 00:13:47,348
Take Sara's car, go upstate.
I'll meet you at the farm.

96
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,613
Bring enough food for two weeks.

97
00:13:49,789 --> 00:13:52,314
Jesus, Robert, did it jump?

98
00:13:52,592 --> 00:13:54,184
Is it airborne?

99
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,329
MARLEY: But we only go to Aunt Sara's
in the summer.

100
00:13:57,497 --> 00:13:59,294
- It may be.
- Oh, my God.

101
00:13:59,465 --> 00:14:03,196
- It's Christmas. What about my presents?
- He's announcing it.

102
00:14:03,369 --> 00:14:05,735
<i>PRESIDENT
Make no mistake, Americans, this virus...</i>

00:14:08,007 --> 00:14:08,996
Hush now, Mar.

105
00:14:09,175 --> 00:14:12,941
<i>- threatens the survival of not only our
nation, but of every other nation...</i>

- Marley, enough!

107
00:14:15,548 --> 00:14:20,076
<i>And so it is with great sadness,
but even greater resolve...</i>

108

<i>ANNOUNCER:

The window is still open. We find
something in a week or two weeks...

113
00:14:38,738 --> 00:14:42,230
...we can reverse the spread.

114
00:14:46,345 --> 00:14:48,643
I can still fix this.

115
00:14:49,615 --> 00:14:53,574
Please. You can do the same work
outside the city.

116
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,553
This is ground zero. This is my site.
We talked about this.

117
00:14:59,859 --> 00:15:01,383
What are you doing?

118
00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:05,756
What am I doing?

119
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:09,129
I'm not gonna let this happen.

120
00:15:09,302 --> 00:15:11,167
Let? This isn't up to you.
You can't control...

121
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:14,199
MARLEY:
Ah! Daddy, it's a monster!

122
00:15:28,588 --> 00:15:30,749
ROBERT:
How'd you sleep?

123
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:08,021
Look out. Come on,
you know better than that.

124
00:16:08,561 --> 00:16:09,721
Uh-uh.

125
00:16:09,895 --> 00:16:11,453
I'll be back.

126
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:49,400
Dr. Robert Neville, September 5th, 2012,
GA series, serum 391.

127
00:16:49,568 --> 00:16:52,594
Animal trials. Streaming video.

128
00:17:14,393 --> 00:17:17,157
GA series results appear typical.

129
00:17:22,301 --> 00:17:27,637

Hold on a second.

135
00:17:58,337 --> 00:18:01,738
Compound 6 appears to be showing
decreased aggression response.

136
00:18:03,342 --> 00:18:06,072
Partial pigmentation return.

137
00:18:07,146 --> 00:18:09,137
Slight pupil constriction.

Good morning, Marge.
Good morning, Fred.

00:19:31,697 --> 00:19:34,257
What are you guys doing here so early?

145
00:19:34,733 --> 00:19:39,033
That's a nice sweatshirt there, Fred.
Don't set it down anywhere.

146

I'll see you guys inside.

147

148
00:20:13,873 --> 00:20:15,500
Yes.

Good morning, Hank.

Wanna see some infected rats?"

155
00:21:11,196 --> 00:21:14,962
Okay, tomorrow.
I'm gonna say hello tomorrow.

Psst.

00:21:42,194 --> 00:21:44,287
Good job. You did so good.

159
00:21:44,463 --> 00:21:47,261
Yes. Yes.

160
00:22:41,186 --> 00:22:42,619
Ah.

161
00:22:45,858 --> 00:22:48,952
Look at that. See that? Red salmon.

00:22:49,128 --> 00:22:52,359
Wow, actual Spam. Yeah.

163
00:22:52,531 --> 00:22:54,522
You'll get some of that later.

164
00:23:17,656 --> 00:23:19,248
Let's go.

165
00:23:25,064 --> 00:23:26,588
Wait.

166
00:24:05,504 --> 00:24:08,405
<i>ROBERT
My name is Robert Neville.</i>

167
00:24:08,574 --> 00:24:11,236
<i>I am a survivor living in New York City.</i>

168
00:24:12,578 --> 00:24:16,981
<i>I am broadcasting on all AM frequencies.</i>

169
00:24:17,149 --> 00:24:20,585
<i>I will be at the South Street Seaport
every day at midday...</i>

170
00:24:20,752 --> 00:24:23,812
<i>... when the sun is highest in the sky.</i>

171
00:24:25,557 --> 00:24:27,787
<i>If you are out there...</i>

172
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:31,627
<i>If anyone is out there...</i>

173
00:24:31,797 --> 00:24:34,061
<i>I can provide food.</i>

174
00:24:34,533 --> 00:24:36,967
<i>I can provide shelter.</i>

175
00:24:37,503 --> 00:24:39,937
<i>I can provide security.</i>

176
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,531
<i>If there's anybody out there...</i>

177
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,473
<i>... anybody...</i>

178
00:24:47,212 --> 00:24:48,804
<i>Please.</i>

179
00:24:49,648 --> 00:24:51,707
<i>You are not alone.</i>

180
00:24:54,219 --> 00:24:57,086
Fore!

181
00:25:16,675 --> 00:25:18,643
Yeah.

182
00:25:23,582 --> 00:25:26,142
Keep your eye on this one for me.

183
00:25:29,621 --> 00:25:30,679
Ooh.

184
00:25:36,094 --> 00:25:38,289
I'm getting good.

185
00:26:11,697 --> 00:26:13,324
Ss-ss.

186
00:26:25,744 --> 00:26:27,712
Sam! No, no, no!

187
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,240
No! No! Sam!

188
00:26:29,615 --> 00:26:31,139
No! No!

189
00:26:33,018 --> 00:26:35,680
Sam? Sam? Sam?

190
00:26:35,854 --> 00:26:38,414
Sam? Sam?

191
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,792
Sam? Sam?

192
00:26:44,062 --> 00:26:46,087
Hello, Sam?

193
00:26:48,367 --> 00:26:49,800
Sam?

194
00:26:53,105 --> 00:26:54,766
Sam?

195
00:26:55,274 --> 00:26:57,572
Come on. Sam.

196
00:27:35,847 --> 00:27:38,042
I gotta go, Sam.

197
00:27:38,216 --> 00:27:41,344
I gotta go. I gotta go.

198
00:29:25,223 --> 00:29:26,918
Sam?

199
00:30:38,029 --> 00:30:40,463
Sam? Sam?

200
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,165
Sam? Sam?

201
00:30:43,335 --> 00:30:46,236
Sam. Sam.

202
00:30:46,404 --> 00:30:50,033
Sam. Sam, come on, we gotta go.
Sam.

203
00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:52,606
What are you doing?

204
00:31:04,089 --> 00:31:05,954
Sam, we gotta go!

205
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,694
Sam, go! Go!

206
00:31:15,867 --> 00:31:18,199
Sam, get out! Get out!

207
00:32:16,061 --> 00:32:20,020
You gotta pay attention, okay?
You gotta pay attention.

208
00:32:20,198 --> 00:32:21,825
Listen, uh...

209
00:32:22,934 --> 00:32:25,926
...I want you to stay here
on this one, okay?

210
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:31,070
Because you can still get infected.

211
00:32:31,876 --> 00:32:33,673
And I can't.

212
00:32:50,528 --> 00:32:53,656
So, look, if I'm not back by dark...

213
00:32:56,968 --> 00:32:58,765
...just go.

214
00:34:29,961 --> 00:34:35,297
Okay. Subject is female.
Likely 18 to 20 years of age.

215
00:34:35,467 --> 00:34:39,801
Dilaudid push only sedates effectively
at six times human dose.

216
00:34:39,971 --> 00:34:43,839
Core temperature, 106 Fahrenheit.
Pulse, 200 bpm.

217
00:34:44,008 --> 00:34:45,134
Respiration elevated.

218
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:49,178
PA 02, 300 percent of normal.

219
00:34:55,587 --> 00:34:57,987
Pupils fully dilated.

220
00:34:58,156 --> 00:35:00,488
Nonreactive to light.

221
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:14,336
Extreme reaction to UV exposure.

222
00:35:14,506 --> 00:35:20,206
Symptoms and tissue samples
confirm subject is infected with KV.

223
00:35:22,947 --> 00:35:24,175
Vaccine test.

224
00:35:24,349 --> 00:35:28,649
GA series, serum 391, Compound 6.

225
00:35:29,521 --> 00:35:30,954
Commencing human trials.

226
00:35:55,446 --> 00:35:56,879
Respiration slowing.

227
00:35:58,483 --> 00:36:02,078
Pulse, 190. Core temperature...

228
00:36:02,754 --> 00:36:04,779
...105...

229
00:36:04,956 --> 00:36:07,447
...104 and decreasing.

230
00:36:09,861 --> 00:36:11,522
We may have something here.

231
00:36:57,208 --> 00:37:03,147
GA series, serum 391, Compound 6
ineffective on humans.

232
00:37:21,799 --> 00:37:26,463
Test results linked to this entry
saved on six redundant drives.

233
00:37:26,638 --> 00:37:28,629
Still no cure.

234
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:48,050
<i>ROBERT:
Day 1001.</i>

235
00:37:48,226 --> 00:37:51,354
<i>We came in close contact
with a hive today.</i>

236
00:37:51,529 --> 00:37:55,260
<i>Blood tests confirm that
I remain immune to both the airborne...</i>

237
00:37:55,733 --> 00:37:58,201
...and contact strains.

238
00:37:58,369 --> 00:38:03,238
Canines remain immune
to airborne strain only.

239
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:08,575
You can't go running
into the dark, dummy.

240
00:38:10,949 --> 00:38:12,382
Vaccine trials continue.

241
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:16,611
I'm still unable to transfer my immunity
to infected hosts.

242
00:38:16,788 --> 00:38:20,053
The Krippin Virus is...

243
00:38:20,224 --> 00:38:22,215
...elegant.

244
00:38:27,265 --> 00:38:30,393
Just fishing in the dark, son.

245
00:38:33,338 --> 00:38:37,274
Mm. A behavioral note, um:

246
00:38:38,276 --> 00:38:42,770
An infected male
exposed himself to sunlight today.

247
00:38:44,415 --> 00:38:47,748
Now, it's possible
decreased brain function...

248
00:38:47,919 --> 00:38:53,016
...or the growing scarcity of food
is causing them to...

249
00:38:54,192 --> 00:38:58,128
...ignore their basic survival instincts.

250
00:39:00,865 --> 00:39:04,494
Social de-evolution appears complete.

251
00:39:05,003 --> 00:39:09,940
Typical human behavior
is now entirely absent.

252
00:39:16,814 --> 00:39:18,304
Why are we stopping?

253
00:39:22,754 --> 00:39:24,813
The street's closed, folks. We hoof it.

254
00:39:24,989 --> 00:39:28,254
- We got less than 10 minutes.
- Baby, give me the dog.

255
00:39:31,896 --> 00:39:33,864
- Come on, baby. Let's go. Let's go.
MARLEY: Daddy!

256
00:39:34,032 --> 00:39:36,364
It's all right. It's all right. Come on.

257
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:40,201
MIKE: Keep the colonel and his family
between us and don't let anyone stop you.

258
00:39:40,371 --> 00:39:41,770
MARLEY:
Mommy, they have guns!

259
00:39:41,939 --> 00:39:43,930
It's okay. They're in the Army like Daddy.

271

00:46:26,107 --> 00:46:27,870
Hey! Hey!

340
00:46:40,988 --> 00:46:44,082
What the hell
are you doing out here, Fred?!

341
00:46:46,661 --> 00:46:49,789
What the...? What the hell are you...?
No!

342
00:46:50,264 --> 00:46:52,664
No! No!

343
00:46:54,869 --> 00:46:56,200
No.

344
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:59,237
What the hell
are you doing out here, Fred?!

345
00:46:59,607 --> 00:47:01,871
How did you get out here?!

346
00:47:02,043 --> 00:47:05,206
Fred, if you're real,
you better tell me right now!

347
00:47:05,379 --> 00:47:08,815
If you're real,
you better tell me right now!

348
00:47:21,796 --> 00:47:23,923
Damn it, Fred!

349
00:47:24,465 --> 00:47:26,456
Damn it!

350
00:49:26,954 --> 00:49:30,355
I'm all right. I'm all right, I'm all right.

351
00:49:56,183 --> 00:49:59,050
I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right.

352
00:50:24,411 --> 00:50:27,039
Baby. I'm okay.

353
00:50:27,982 --> 00:50:31,145
I'm okay. I'm okay.

354
00:51:48,762 --> 00:51:50,525
Let's go.

355
00:51:50,698 --> 00:51:53,633
Eh, eh! Come on. Sam, come on.

356
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,172
Let's go! Sam!

357
00:52:17,458 --> 00:52:19,221
No! No! Let's go!

358
00:52:19,393 --> 00:52:22,123
We gotta go home, Sam. Let's go!

359
00:52:50,924 --> 00:52:52,357
Sam!

360
00:52:58,766 --> 00:53:00,631
No!

361
00:53:24,324 --> 00:53:26,724
Sam? Sam?

362
00:53:29,496 --> 00:53:30,861
It's okay.

363
00:53:31,031 --> 00:53:34,091
You're all right. Okay. It's okay.

364
00:53:34,268 --> 00:53:36,759
You're all right. You're all right.

365
00:53:37,171 --> 00:53:39,901
Samantha? Samantha, look at me, girl.

366
00:53:40,074 --> 00:53:44,306
Hey. You're okay.
You're okay. Samantha.

367
00:53:44,478 --> 00:53:47,641
We just gotta get you home.
Gotta get you... Gotta take you home.

368
00:53:47,815 --> 00:53:50,375
Let me take you home.
All right, come here.

369
00:53:50,551 --> 00:53:53,019
Come here. Come here. Come here.

370
00:54:27,921 --> 00:54:29,479
Come on. Come here. Come here.

371
00:54:29,756 --> 00:54:32,088
I got you. I got you.

372
00:54:39,099 --> 00:54:40,828
It's okay.

373
00:54:41,735 --> 00:54:43,464
You're okay.

374
00:54:51,545 --> 00:54:53,274
<i>Don't worry</i>

375
00:54:55,482 --> 00:54:57,609
<i>About a thing</i>

376
00:54:58,652 --> 00:55:03,817
<i>'Cause every little thing
Is gonna be all right</i>

377
00:55:07,294 --> 00:55:12,926
<i>Don't worry
About a thing</i>

378
00:55:17,738 --> 00:55:20,172
<i>Rise up this morning</i>

379
00:55:21,808 --> 00:55:24,402
<i>Smiled with the rising sun</i>

380
00:55:30,717 --> 00:55:32,742
<i>Three little birds</i>

381
00:58:35,969 --> 00:58:38,403
I promised my friend...

382
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:45,205
...that I would say hello to you today.

383
00:58:49,883 --> 00:58:51,612
Hello.

384
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:01,054
Hello.

385
00:59:11,538 --> 00:59:14,336
Please say hello to me.

386
00:59:21,214 --> 00:59:23,978
Please say hello to me.

387
01:00:44,464 --> 01:00:46,022
Die!

388
01:00:46,333 --> 01:00:47,425
Die!

389
01:01:01,448 --> 01:01:03,177
Die!

390
01:02:43,116 --> 01:02:46,517
WOMAN
Come on! Stay with me!

391
01:02:48,054 --> 01:02:50,614
Where do you live?

392
01:02:52,459 --> 01:02:54,324
Hey.

393
01:02:54,794 --> 01:02:56,318
Hey!

394
01:02:56,496 --> 01:02:58,623
Stay with me.

395
01:02:59,532 --> 01:03:01,796
Where do you live?

396
01:03:04,771 --> 01:03:07,296
Where do you live?

397
01:03:08,074 --> 01:03:09,302
ROBERT:
Uh...

398
01:03:09,476 --> 01:03:13,674
11 Washington Square.

399
01:03:14,214 --> 01:03:16,944
They don't know where I live.

400
01:03:17,851 --> 01:03:21,309
Don't... Don't let them track us.

401
01:03:21,755 --> 01:03:24,280
You gotta stay out till dawn.

402
01:04:28,154 --> 01:04:29,143
No!

403
01:04:30,724 --> 01:04:32,658
<i>MAN
Donkey?</i>

404
01:04:33,626 --> 01:04:34,718
<i>What are you doing?</i>

405
01:04:34,894 --> 01:04:38,227
<i>I would think of all people you would
recognize a wall when you see one.</i>

406
01:04:38,398 --> 01:04:43,165
<i>Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed to go
around my swamp, not through it.</i>

407
01:04:43,336 --> 01:04:46,305
<i>DONKEY: It is. Around your half, see?
That's your half, this is my half.</i>

408
01:04:46,473 --> 01:04:50,034
<i>SHREK: Oh, your half? Hm.
DONKEY: Yes, my half.</i>

409
01:04:50,210 --> 01:04:53,839
<i>I helped rescue the princess. I did
half the work. I get half the booty.</i>

410
01:04:54,013 --> 01:04:57,380
<i>Now hand me that big old rock,
the one that looks like your head.</i>

411
01:04:57,550 --> 01:04:59,677
<i>SHREK: Back off!
DONKEY: No, you back off.</i>

412
01:04:59,853 --> 01:05:01,912
<i>SHREK: This is my swamp!
DONKEY: Our swamp.</i>

413
01:05:04,758 --> 01:05:07,556
<i>- Smelly ogre.
SHREK: Fine!</i>

414
01:05:08,261 --> 01:05:09,990
<i>DONKEY: Come back,
I'm not through with you!</i>

415
01:05:10,163 --> 01:05:11,653
<i>SHREK:
Well, I'm through with you.</i>

416
01:05:11,831 --> 01:05:14,925
<i>DONKEY: You know, with you
it's always "me, me, me."</i>

417
01:05:15,101 --> 01:05:20,164
<i>Well, guess what, now it's my turn.
So you just shut up and pay attention!</i>

418
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:24,504
<i>You are mean to me! You insult me and
you don't appreciate anything that I do.</i>

419
01:05:24,677 --> 01:05:27,077
<i>You're always pushing me around
or pushing me away.</i>

420
01:05:27,247 --> 01:05:31,616
<i>Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad,
how come you came back?</i>

421
01:05:31,785 --> 01:05:34,948
<i>DONKEY: Because that's what friends do!
They forgive each other!</i>

422
01:05:35,321 --> 01:05:37,016
<i>SHREK:
Oh, yeah.</i>

423
01:05:37,190 --> 01:05:39,522
<i>You're right, Donkey. I forgive you...</i>

424
01:05:39,692 --> 01:05:41,159
<i>... for stabbing me in the back!</i>

425
01:05:44,531 --> 01:05:48,023
<i>DONKEY: You're so wrapped up in layers,
you're afraid of your own feelings.</i>

426
01:05:48,201 --> 01:05:49,361
<i>SHREK: Go away.
DONKEY: See?</i>

427
01:05:49,536 --> 01:05:51,663
<i>Doing it again,
just like you did to Fiona...</i>

428
01:05:51,838 --> 01:05:54,033
<i>... and all she did was like you,
maybe love you.</i>

429
01:05:54,207 --> 01:05:58,667
<i>SHREK: Love me? She said I was ugly,
a hideous creature.</i>

430
01:05:58,845 --> 01:06:00,472
<i>I heard the two of you talking.</i>

431
01:06:00,647 --> 01:06:05,482
<i>DONKEY: She wasn't talking about you,
she was talking about somebody else.</i>

432
01:06:14,527 --> 01:06:16,995
I'm afraid the eggs are powdered.

433
01:06:17,163 --> 01:06:19,188
Obviously you know that.

434
01:06:20,066 --> 01:06:21,260
They're yours.

435
01:06:21,434 --> 01:06:26,428
But I did find bacon, which is about
the most fantastic thing in history.

436
01:06:26,606 --> 01:06:30,406
And some antibiotics in the bathroom.

437
01:06:30,577 --> 01:06:32,943
I put by your plate,
because your leg is okay...

438
01:06:33,112 --> 01:06:37,310
...but it won't be for very long
if you don't start a course soon.

439
01:06:38,618 --> 01:06:40,415
ROBERT:
Who are you?

440
01:06:41,888 --> 01:06:44,448
ANNA:
I'm Anna and that's Ethan.

441
01:06:51,531 --> 01:06:53,658
Don't let it get cold.

442
01:07:06,579 --> 01:07:09,343
It's okay. Go on.

443
01:07:34,507 --> 01:07:38,603
We came from Maryland.
We heard your message on the radio.

444
01:07:39,312 --> 01:07:42,372
We were at the pier at noon.
We waited all day.

445
01:07:44,350 --> 01:07:46,818
We're going to Vermont.

446
01:07:47,487 --> 01:07:50,149
To the survivors' colony.

447
01:07:50,723 --> 01:07:52,315
What?

448
01:07:53,259 --> 01:07:56,888
In Bethel. It's a safe zone.

449
01:07:57,063 --> 01:07:59,531
There's no survivors' colony,
there's no safe zones.

450
01:07:59,699 --> 01:08:01,724
Nothing happened
the way it was supposed to.

451
01:08:01,901 --> 01:08:03,801
Nothing worked
the way it was supposed to.

452
01:08:03,970 --> 01:08:08,566
In the mountains. There's a whole colony
of people there who didn't get sick.

453
01:08:08,741 --> 01:08:11,266
The virus couldn't survive the cold.
There's a colony...

454
01:08:11,444 --> 01:08:13,674
ROBERT:
Shut up! Shut up!

455
01:08:13,846 --> 01:08:15,279
Everybody's dead.

456
01:08:15,515 --> 01:08:17,574
Everybody is dead.

457
01:08:25,525 --> 01:08:28,619
I just need...
I need a minute. Okay?

458
01:08:30,229 --> 01:08:31,753
Just...

459
01:08:35,668 --> 01:08:38,569
I just... I was saving that bacon.

460
01:08:40,139 --> 01:08:41,436
I was saving it.

461
01:08:44,277 --> 01:08:46,745
I'm just... I'm gonna go upstairs.
All right? Just...

462
01:08:46,913 --> 01:08:48,938
I'm gonna go.

463
01:09:07,066 --> 01:09:09,694
Ethan, put the knife down.

464
01:09:44,704 --> 01:09:48,640
<i>MAN You there! Ogre.
SHREK: Aye.</i>

465
01:09:48,808 --> 01:09:50,969
<i>MAN:
By the order of Lord Farquaad...</i>

466
01:09:51,144 --> 01:09:53,544
<i>... I am authorized
to place you both under arrest...</i>

467
01:09:53,713 --> 01:09:59,515
<i>... and transport you
to a designated resettlement facility.</i>

468
01:09:59,685 --> 01:10:04,054
<i>Oh, really? You and what army?</i>

469
01:10:15,334 --> 01:10:16,995
Can I say something to you?

470
01:10:17,170 --> 01:10:20,162
You was really, really something
back there. Incredible.

471
01:10:20,506 --> 01:10:22,531
Are you talking to...

472
01:10:23,676 --> 01:10:24,700
...me?

473
01:10:26,145 --> 01:10:29,376
Yes, I was talking to you.
You was really great back there.

474
01:10:29,549 --> 01:10:32,780
Those guards, they thought they was
all that. You showed up, and bam!

475
01:10:32,952 --> 01:10:35,216
Tripping over themselves
like babes in the woods.

476
01:10:35,388 --> 01:10:37,413
That really made me
feel good to see that.

477
01:10:37,590 --> 01:10:39,785
That's great. Really.
Man, it's good to be free.

478
01:10:40,259 --> 01:10:44,093
Now, why don't you go celebrate
your freedom with your own friends?

479
01:10:44,263 --> 01:10:45,753
Hm?

480
01:10:45,932 --> 01:10:47,365
But, uh...

481
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:49,158
...I don't have any friends.

482
01:10:49,335 --> 01:10:51,803
And I'm not going out there by myself.

483
01:10:51,971 --> 01:10:54,599
Wait a minute. I got a great idea.
I'll stick with you!

484
01:10:54,774 --> 01:10:56,537
<i>DONKEY:
You a mean, green fighting machine.</i>

485
01:10:56,709 --> 01:10:59,803
<i>Together we'll scare the spit
out of anybody that crosses us.</i>

486
01:11:03,049 --> 01:11:04,311
<i>I like Shrek.</i>

487
01:11:04,484 --> 01:11:06,918
<i>DONKEY: That was really scary.
If you don't mind me saying...</i>

488
01:11:07,086 --> 01:11:09,816
<i>... if that don't work, your breath
will get the job done...</i>

489
01:11:09,989 --> 01:11:13,925
<i>... because you definitely need some
tic tacs, because your breath stinks!</i>

490
01:11:14,527 --> 01:11:18,554
<i>Man, you almost burned the hair
out of my nose. Just like the time...</i>

491
01:11:21,033 --> 01:11:23,661
You're not so good with people anymore,
are you?

492
01:11:29,108 --> 01:11:31,633
Thank you for my leg.

493
01:11:34,147 --> 01:11:35,910
Okay.

494
01:11:38,985 --> 01:11:40,509
Where have you been?

495
01:11:40,753 --> 01:11:44,314
I was on a Red Cross evacuation ship
out of Sao Paulo.

496
01:11:44,490 --> 01:11:47,584
Those boats
weren't meant to be permanent.

497
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,318
No, they weren't.

498
01:11:49,495 --> 01:11:52,487
When the Navy fell apart,
we started docking to take on supplies.

499
01:11:52,665 --> 01:11:56,431
Someone picked it up on shore.
Five of us were immune.

500
01:11:56,602 --> 01:11:58,263
You said five?

501
01:11:58,938 --> 01:12:01,304
The Darkseekers got them.

502
01:12:03,676 --> 01:12:06,304
You are the Robert Neville, aren't you?

503
01:12:15,154 --> 01:12:16,519
It's too late today.

504
01:12:16,689 --> 01:12:19,817
If we leave tomorrow at dawn, we can
make it to Vermont in a straight shot.

505
01:12:19,992 --> 01:12:22,460
- So if you had...
- I'm not leaving.

506
01:12:23,329 --> 01:12:25,661
This is ground zero.

507
01:12:27,099 --> 01:12:29,260
This is my site.

508
01:12:30,903 --> 01:12:33,394
I'm not gonna let this happen.

509
01:12:35,575 --> 01:12:37,873
I can still fix this.

510
01:12:50,690 --> 01:12:55,354
ROBERT: Whoa. You scared me.
- Sorry.

511
01:12:55,528 --> 01:12:56,859
I called down twice.

512
01:12:57,029 --> 01:12:59,691
Oh. Oh, thank you.

513
01:13:04,370 --> 01:13:07,965
It's heavily sedated.
Don't worry, it's safe.

514
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:10,870
I've never seen one so still.

515
01:13:11,477 --> 01:13:14,173
They're always biting.

516
01:13:18,184 --> 01:13:20,516
You think that can cure her?

517
01:13:20,686 --> 01:13:23,621
Um... No, this will
almost certainly kill it...

518
01:13:23,789 --> 01:13:27,020
...but it's possible by drastically reducing
the body temperature...

519
01:13:27,193 --> 01:13:30,185
...I can increase the compound's
effectiveness.

520
01:13:41,474 --> 01:13:43,772
Did all of them die?

521
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:45,568
Yes.

522
01:13:48,648 --> 01:13:50,639
ANNA:
My God.

523
01:13:51,484 --> 01:13:55,215
God didn't do this, Anna, we did.

524
01:14:00,559 --> 01:14:02,891
Where can Ethan sleep?

525
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:23,445
He's heavy.

526
01:14:29,955 --> 01:14:31,752
Can you get that?

527
01:15:03,556 --> 01:15:05,854
She's beautiful.

528
01:15:06,325 --> 01:15:08,225
What's her name?

529
01:15:09,929 --> 01:15:11,829
Marley.

530
01:15:13,099 --> 01:15:16,660
- Her name was Marley.
- It's a beautiful name.

531
01:15:18,571 --> 01:15:22,598
Yeah. We named her after Bob Marley.

532
01:15:22,775 --> 01:15:26,108
- Who?
- Uh, the singer.

533
01:15:27,146 --> 01:15:28,875
Damian?

534
01:15:30,149 --> 01:15:32,174
Uh, his father.

535
01:15:35,454 --> 01:15:37,718
His father.

536
01:15:38,791 --> 01:15:39,917
Nope.

537
01:15:40,092 --> 01:15:42,185
<i>I shot the sheriff</i>

538
01:15:45,498 --> 01:15:48,467
<i>But I didn't shoot the deputy</i>

539
01:15:55,975 --> 01:16:01,003
- Oh, that is unacceptable.
- What?

540
01:16:05,651 --> 01:16:08,142
Best album ever made.

541
01:16:17,496 --> 01:16:20,556
- You don't recognize that?
- Mm-mm.

542
01:16:21,867 --> 01:16:23,095
Wow.

543
01:16:25,271 --> 01:16:30,834
He had this idea,
it was kind of a virologist's idea.

544
01:16:31,010 --> 01:16:35,640
He believed that you could cure
racism and hate. Literally cure it...

545
01:16:35,815 --> 01:16:41,947
...by injecting music and love
into people's lives.

546
01:16:42,788 --> 01:16:46,656
One day, he was scheduled
to perform at a peace rally.

547
01:16:46,826 --> 01:16:50,785
Gunmen came to his house
and shot him down.

548
01:16:52,631 --> 01:16:53,962
Two days later...

549
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:58,229
...he walked out on that stage and sang.

550
01:17:00,039 --> 01:17:02,439
Somebody asked him why.

551
01:17:04,243 --> 01:17:06,711
He said, "The people...

552
01:17:06,879 --> 01:17:11,942
...who are trying to make this world worse
are not taking a day off.

553
01:17:13,118 --> 01:17:15,109
How can I?"

554
01:17:18,190 --> 01:17:21,023
Light up the darkness.

555
01:17:47,052 --> 01:17:49,282
Come with us, Neville.

556
01:17:49,855 --> 01:17:51,880
To the colony.

557
01:17:55,594 --> 01:17:58,028
There's no colony, Anna.

558
01:18:02,334 --> 01:18:03,858
Everything just fell apart.

559
01:18:04,036 --> 01:18:07,733
- There was no evacuation plan...
- You're wrong. There is a colony.

560
01:18:08,307 --> 01:18:10,332
I know, okay?

561
01:18:11,777 --> 01:18:13,005
How do you know, Anna?

562
01:18:19,518 --> 01:18:20,576
I just know.

563
01:18:22,855 --> 01:18:26,985
How? I said, how do you know?
How could you know?

564
01:18:28,694 --> 01:18:30,025
God told me.

565
01:18:30,529 --> 01:18:32,520
He has a plan.

566
01:18:34,266 --> 01:18:36,860
- God told you?
- Yes.

567
01:18:37,036 --> 01:18:39,766
- The God?
- Yes.

568
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:43,774
- I know how this sounds.
- It sounds crazy.

569
01:18:43,943 --> 01:18:47,743
But something told me
to turn on the radio.

570
01:18:47,913 --> 01:18:49,540
Something told me to come here.

571
01:18:49,715 --> 01:18:52,513
My voice on the radio
told you to come here, Anna.

572
01:18:52,685 --> 01:18:54,710
You were trying to kill yourself
last night?

573
01:18:54,887 --> 01:18:55,876
Anna.

574
01:18:56,055 --> 01:18:59,218
I got here just in time to save your life.
That's a coincidence?

575
01:18:59,391 --> 01:19:03,020
- Just stop it. Stop it. Stop.
- He must have sent me here for a reason.

576
01:19:04,196 --> 01:19:07,222
Neville, the world is quieter now.

577
01:19:07,399 --> 01:19:09,458
You just have to listen.

578
01:19:09,635 --> 01:19:11,796
If we listen...

579
01:19:12,471 --> 01:19:14,439
...we can hear God's plan.

580
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,665
- God's plan?
- Yeah.

581
01:19:16,842 --> 01:19:19,402
All right. Let me tell you
about your God's plan.

582
01:19:19,578 --> 01:19:22,479
There were 6 billion people on Earth
when the infection hit.

583
01:19:22,648 --> 01:19:27,244
KV had a 90 percent kill rate.
That's 5.4 billion...

584
01:19:27,419 --> 01:19:29,887
...people dead.

585
01:19:30,055 --> 01:19:32,888
Crashed and bled out, dead.

586
01:19:33,058 --> 01:19:34,923
Less than 1 percent immunity.

587
01:19:35,094 --> 01:19:38,894
That left 12 million healthy people
like you, me and Ethan.

588
01:19:39,064 --> 01:19:43,194
The other 588 million...

589
01:19:43,369 --> 01:19:45,360
...turned into your Darkseekers.

590
01:19:45,537 --> 01:19:47,232
And then they got hungry.

591
01:19:47,406 --> 01:19:51,809
And they killed and fed on everybody.

592
01:19:52,978 --> 01:19:55,071
Everybody!

593
01:19:55,781 --> 01:20:00,741
Every single person
that you or I has ever known...

594
01:20:00,919 --> 01:20:02,853
...is dead!

595
01:20:05,190 --> 01:20:07,090
Dead!

596
01:20:08,427 --> 01:20:11,157
There is no God. There is no God.

597
01:20:16,468 --> 01:20:18,299
What is that?

598
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:24,973
Was it still dark when you
brought us home last night?

599
01:20:25,144 --> 01:20:28,238
You were bleeding.
There was light on the horizon.

600
01:20:29,815 --> 01:20:32,545
Turn the light off. Turn it off.

601
01:20:39,825 --> 01:20:41,258
They followed us home.

602
01:20:41,427 --> 01:20:43,088
Ethan.

603
01:21:29,274 --> 01:21:30,935
Shit.

604
01:21:43,655 --> 01:21:45,282
Anna.

605
01:21:46,825 --> 01:21:48,622
Anna.

606
01:21:53,398 --> 01:21:55,025
Anna!

607
01:22:06,645 --> 01:22:08,579
Anna!

608
01:22:11,984 --> 01:22:13,576
Anna!

609
01:24:00,025 --> 01:24:01,652
Anna?

610
01:24:05,631 --> 01:24:07,360
Anna.

611
01:25:05,223 --> 01:25:07,418
Come on. Come on.

612
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:10,428
- Are you okay? You all right?
ANNA: Yeah.

613
01:25:10,595 --> 01:25:12,119
Are you all right?

614
01:25:12,764 --> 01:25:14,891
- You okay?
- Oh, my God. You're bleeding.

615
01:25:28,547 --> 01:25:31,141
Go to the lab. Downstairs, go!

616
01:25:31,416 --> 01:25:34,214
Get to the lab! To the lab!

617
01:25:43,562 --> 01:25:44,586
Get behind the Plexi.

618
01:25:45,430 --> 01:25:47,091
Oh, my God. Come on.

619
01:25:59,678 --> 01:26:01,441
Come on, it's okay. It's okay.

620
01:26:03,248 --> 01:26:05,011
Oh, my God.

621
01:26:17,496 --> 01:26:19,487
It's working.

622
01:26:23,835 --> 01:26:25,200
Neville...

623
01:26:26,505 --> 01:26:28,302
...it's working.

624
01:26:33,612 --> 01:26:35,409
No! Stop! Stop!

625
01:26:36,715 --> 01:26:39,013
Look, look, look, I can save you.

626
01:26:39,184 --> 01:26:42,642
I can sa... I can help you.
You are sick and I can help you.

627
01:26:45,757 --> 01:26:47,725
I can... I can fix this!

628
01:26:47,893 --> 01:26:49,417
I can save everybody!

629
01:26:49,594 --> 01:26:52,825
I can fix everything! It's working.
It's working!

630
01:26:56,068 --> 01:26:57,501
Stop! Stop!

631
01:27:03,642 --> 01:27:07,078
Let me save you! Let me save you!

632
01:27:07,245 --> 01:27:08,234
No, no!

633
01:27:19,057 --> 01:27:20,388
No, no!

634
01:27:37,309 --> 01:27:39,539
<i>MARLEY:
Daddy, look, it's a butterfly.</i>

635
01:28:05,704 --> 01:28:07,262
Robert.

636
01:28:07,572 --> 01:28:10,302
- What are you doing?
- The cure is in her blood.

637
01:28:14,846 --> 01:28:17,314
Coal chute. I think it'll be safe.
Ethan, get in!

638
01:28:17,682 --> 01:28:19,081
- Go.
- Come on, get in.

639
01:28:19,251 --> 01:28:21,116
- Get in.
- Anna.

640
01:28:24,789 --> 01:28:27,223
I think this is why you're here.

641
01:28:30,295 --> 01:28:31,990
What are you doing?

642
01:28:32,164 --> 01:28:34,223
I'm listening.

643
01:28:34,833 --> 01:28:36,664
- Neville, there's room. Come!
- No.

644
01:28:36,835 --> 01:28:39,804
They're not gonna stop.
They're not gonna stop.

645
01:28:42,707 --> 01:28:44,038
Stay in till dawn.

646
01:31:02,580 --> 01:31:07,313

burned through our civilization...</i>

01:31:07,485 --> 01:31:10,750
<i>... pushing humankind
to the edge of extinction.</i>

648
01:31:10,922 --> 01:31:13,857
