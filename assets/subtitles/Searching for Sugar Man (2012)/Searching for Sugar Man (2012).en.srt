(# <i>Sugar Man</i> by Rodriguez)

2
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:34,706
# <i>Sugar Man, won't you hurry?</i>

3
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:39,965
# <i>Cos I'm tired of these scenes</i>

4
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:45,050
# <i>For a blue coin,
won't you bring back</i>

5
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:50,184

00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:09,452
<i>(Stephen Segerman)
I got my nickname from this song.</i>

10
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:13,908
When I was in the Army they used to
mispronounce Segerman as Sugar Man.

11
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:17,211
And then they just started calling me
Sugar and that became my nickname.

12
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:23,797
<i>It's 40 years since this LP called</i>
Cold Fact <i>by Rodriguez was released.</i>

13
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:27,467
<i>And in South Africa
it was a very popular album.</i>

14
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:30,345
<i>It was one of the biggest albums
of the day.</i>

15
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:33,519
<i>But the thing was,
we didn't know who this guy was.</i>

16
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:36,689
<i>All our other rock stars,
we had all the information we needed.</i>

17
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,186
<i>But this guy? There was nothing.</i>

18
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:42,611
<i>And then we found out
that he had committed suicide.</i>

19
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:47,533
<i>He set himself alight on stage and
burnt to death in front of the audience.</i>

20
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:51,362
<i>It was the most incredible thing.
It wasn't just a suicide.</i>

21
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:55,245
<i>It was probably the most
grotesque suicide in rock history.</i>

22
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,344
(thunder crashing)

23
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:12,253
(Dennis Coffey) The first time that
I remember actually recognizing him is

24
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,838
Mike Theodore called me
on the phone one day and said,

25
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,800
"I have this artist
I want you to come see with me.

26
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,681
"This guy's name is Rodriguez,

27
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,728
"he's working down by the Detroit River.

28
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,646
"There's a bar down there,

29
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:26,271
"down by the wharf riverside district.

30
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,726
"Let's go see him tonight.

31
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,061
"I think you'll really like him".

32
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:33,445
<i>So that night, I remember,
we pull up...</i>

33
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:36,694
<i>away in this kinda isolated
part of Detroit</i>

34
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,825
<i>right on the side of the Detroit River,</i>

35
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:42,750
<i>and you could see the mist in the air
coming off the river. We could feel it.</i>

36
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:46,545
And we went inside there,
and as we walked in the door,

37
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,339
we could hear behind us
the sound of the freighters

38
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,132
as they're going down the river,

39
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,553
and so it's like you're walking out
of a Sherlock Holmes novel.

40
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:58,007
You walk out of the mist
and you go into this place,

41
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,558
and inside the place,
it's all full of smoke,

42
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,261
so there's a mist inside there.

43
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,897
<i>(Mike Theodore) Boom, hey, you know,
it's a wall of smoke.</i>

44
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:10,569
<i>Beer all over the place. Peanut shells.
It was just a mess.</i>

45
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:14,649
And then you hear this strumming sound.

46
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,700
Strumming and batting the guitar.

47
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,698
(mimics guitar batting)

48
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:24,242
And then you hear this voice.
Strange voice.

49
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,702
<i>(Coffey) Finally, we walked
through the smoke, and I looked,</i>

50
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:29,254
<i>and there in the far corner I saw...</i>

51
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,674
I could see the shadow of a man
and I couldn't see his face.

52
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,719
I said, "What's the deal?"
So we got a little closer...

53
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:41,680
<i>(Theodore) And you see this guy
with his back to you.</i>

54
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:46,722
<i>So all you see is his back
and he's in a corner, singing.</i>

55
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,942
<i>It was an ethereal scene, if you will.</i>

56
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:56,444
Foggy night, foghorns, smoke so thick
you couldn't see through it.

57
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,067
<i>And here's this voice.</i>

58
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,611
<i>(Coffey) Maybe it forced you
to listen to the lyrics</i>

59
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,697
<i>'cause you couldn't see the guy's face.</i>

60
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,080
<i>That's when we talked to him

61
00:06:05,081 --> 00:06:07,081
<i>and figured we needed to do an album on him.

62
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:11,459
The only writer that I had heard of,
of that time period,

63
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:15,042
was maybe Bob Dylan,
that was writing that well.

64
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:20,051
(# <i>Crucify Your Mind</i> by Rodriguez)

65
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:41,322
# <i>Was it a huntsman or a player</i>

66
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,029
# <i>That made you pay the cost</i>

67
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,991
# <i>That now assumes relaxed positions</i>

68
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,792
# <i>And prostitutes your loss?</i>

69
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,667
# <i>Were you tortured by your own thirst</i>

70
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,420
# <i>In those pleasures that you seek</i>

71
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:58,172

# <i>Something you call unique</i>

75
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,284
# <i>But I've seen your self-pity showing</i>

76
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:32,836
# <i>As the tears roll down your cheeks</i>

77
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,383
<i>(Dan DiMaggio) He was this
wandering spirit around the city.</i>

78
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:42,088
<i>And, uh, sometimes
I might catch him in the corner.</i>

79
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,640
You know, Detroit's got its share of,
uh, burned-out, desolate areas

80
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:48,931
and I would occasionally see him, um,

81
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,976
far away from The Brewery,
and I wondered,

82
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:55,309
and it just added
to this mythology of him.

83
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:59,113
Like, what is he doing?
What is he doing? What does he do?

84
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:03,784
I heard he did a little roofing,
some construction work.

85
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,953
Um, I think that's how he got his money
at the time.

86
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,656
He just was, you know,
and I say this with love,

87
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:12,125
I say this with respect, but,

88
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,202
I thought he was just a...

89
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:19,090
just not much more than a kind of
a homeless person, you know?

90
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,214
He just was a drifter.
He was just... Um...

91
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:26,218
<i>I didn't know if he had a home,
you know?</i>

92
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:30,264
<i>He'd look like maybe he'd go
from shelter to shelter or something.</i>

93
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,105
<i>(Coffey) Detroit in the '70s
was a hard place.</i>

94
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,777
<i>Well, it's still a hard place.</i>

95
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:44,984
<i>Lot of decay, lots of ruined houses.
Real poverty exists in this city.</i>

96
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:48,445
<i>And those streets
were Rodriguez's natural habitat.</i>

97
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,657
Any time we met him
to talk about what we were doing,

98
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:55,661
he would always meet us on a corner
somewhere in his neighbourhood.

99
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,254
Most of the time
he wasn't coming to my house.

100
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:01,378
He'd say, "Meet me on the corner
of this street and that street,"

101
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,960
and we would be there.

102
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:06,172
Uh, Mike and I would get out of our cars
and park our cars,

103
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,631
so we'd be standing on the corner,

104
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,387
and then we'd look round
and he'd be there all of a sudden.

105
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:10,934
He'd just show up.

106
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,853
<i>We thought he was like
the inner city poet.</i>

107
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:17,523
<i>You know? Putting his poems to music
of what he saw.</i>

108
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,815
<i>And it was definitely a very gritty look</i>

109
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,067
<i>at what he saw
on the streets of Detroit.</i>

110
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:26,650
<i>What he saw in his neighbourhood.
Who was walking around the streets.</i>

111
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:31,822
<i>And the way he presented it in a song,
I thought was very, very interesting.</i>

112
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,167
<i>(Theodore) We were working
at Tera-Shirma recording studio.</i>

113
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:40,585
<i>When he opened up and sang,
you went, "Whoa, this guy's got it".</i>

114
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:46,011
<i>Rodriguez, at that time,
had all the machinery in place.</i>

115
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,925
<i>Big names, big money behind it.
Circumstances were right.</i>

116
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:55,683
<i>Why didn't it make it? That's the
big question that today still haunts me.</i>

117
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:59,437
Did he get enough promotion?
Did he do enough performances?

118
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,018
Was he too political?

119
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,696
Was there this or was there that?

120
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,941
Should it have been green
instead of orange?

121
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:11,119
Should it have been a violin
instead of an oboe?

122
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:12,992
On and on you can go.

123
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,626
But the end of the day is, if you
listen to the stuff now, you'd say,

124
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,670
"I don't understand it, he's right-on".

125
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,958
<i>(Jerome Ferretti)
I only heard him play once,</i>

126
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:29,512
<i>and one of the songs that
he had on his album, it was called...</i>

127
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,384
<i>The Sugar Man</i>? Was it <i>Sugar Man</i>?
Is that the name of the song?

128
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:37,388
Um, I knew that guy, the Sugar Man.

129
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:40,732
And his name was Volkswagen Cha...
Volkswagen Frank!

130
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,229
And he lived right around the corner

131
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,478
and you used to go over
to Volkswagen Frank's.

132

that I'd like to show you

145
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:44,626
that I've kept since my days in England
with Rodriguez.

146
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,419
Let me see.

147
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:49,793
Possibly it's in this book,
I don't know where.

148
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:54,218
These are all my photos
from when I was acting.

149
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:58,473
That's me, and that's Jimmy Dean.
That was in 1955.

150
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:02,814
Hang on, I think I've found them.
Think they're in here.

151
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,309
Yeah, here they are.

152
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:10,279
Wow. Good Lord, here they are.

153
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:15,319
You know, I haven't seen these pictures
in almost 35 years.

154
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,498
He's my most memorable artist.

155
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:24,168
You know, I've produced
a lot of great ones, but...

156
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,665
he's my most memorable.

157
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,167
<i>It's not just a talent.</i>

158
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:33,924
<i>He's like...</i>

159
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,469
<i>He's like a wise man, a prophet.</i>

160
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:41,186
<i>He's way beyond
just being a musical artist.</i>

161
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,347
<i>And he probably could have done
fantastically well</i>

162
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,849
<i>if he had have continued.</i>

163
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:49,937
When I met him, they said,
"Rodriguez, this is Steve Rowland.

164
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,863
"He really likes your album".
And Rodriguez said to me,

165
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:56,193
"Well, did you like <i>Cold Facts</i>?"

166
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,866
I said, "Man, I thought
it was absolutely brilliant.

167
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,363
"Absolutely brilliant.

168
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:04,201
"I can't believe that this album
didn't do anything.

169
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,874
"It's just a fantastic album".

170
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,538
So he played me...

171
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:12,714
Well, his next album was on...
In those days you had cassettes.

172
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:17,305
He had demos of this next album that
he was gonna call <i>Coming From Reality</i>.

173
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:22,557
And I said, "Wow, man,
this has got to be a smash.

174
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:24,224
"These are great songs.

175
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:29,897
"Little bit... Little bit different from
the others," I said, "but great songs".

176
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:33,237
I said, "And a couple of them
were so sad". You know.

177
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:36,567
There's one in there
that's absolutely a killer.

178
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:38,739
It's one of the saddest songs that...

179
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:43,832
I'm laughing, but it's one of
the saddest songs that I've ever heard.

180
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:47,251
And it's a very simple song.
Hang on, I wanna play this. Hang on.

181
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,541

was the album was released
in November of 1971,

197
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:18,961
and we expected big things.
And it did absolutely nothing.

198
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:24,341
And then, two weeks before Christmas,

199
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:28,311
Sussex dropped him off the label.

200
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:33,521
And the very first line in the song,
as if premonition,

201
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:37,396
was, "I lost my job
two weeks before Christmas".

Nobody...

206
00:15:57,248 --> 00:16:00,343
Nobody even was interested
in listening to him.

(Willem Möller)
I remember I was in high school

233
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:30,402
and we heard this song, "I wonder
how many times you've had sex?"

234
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:33,075
And at that time South Africa
was very conservative.

235
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,414
It was the height of apartheid,

236
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:38,410
and there wasn't television here.

237
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:41,913
That's how conservative it was,
'cause television was communist.

238
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:44,665
It was really... You wouldn't believe.

239
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,718
Everything was restricted,
everything was censored.

240
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,257
Everything was...

241
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,426
And here's this guy singing this song.

242
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,266
<i>"Who's that?" Said, "That's Rodriguez".</i>

243
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:58,559
<i>And he became something
of a rebel sort of icon.</i>

244
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:01,774
<i>But the strange thing was
that we all bought his records.</i>

245
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,728
Everybody I knew had his records.
<i>I Wonder</i>,

246
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,067
that was the big song
that everybody was singing

247
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,610
and we all bought a record.

248
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:12,281
And there he was on the cover,
sort of a hippy with shades.

249
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:15,575
But nobody knew anything about him.
He was a mystery.

250
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:19,451
Unlike other artists
that you could read about from America,

251
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:24,126
get to know something about them,
there was zilch. Nobody knew anything.

252
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:28,422
It was a mystery. We only had
his picture on the cover of the record.

And you would always see
<i>Cold Fact</i> by Rodriguez.

269
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,309
To us, it was one of the most
famous records of all time.

"Be anti-establishment".</i>

Anti-Establishment Blues.

272
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:29,987
We didn't know what the word
"anti-establishment" was

273
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:33,153
until it cropped up on a Rodriguez song
and then we found out,

274
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:36,153
it's OK to protest against your society,

275
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:39,076
to be angry with your society.

276
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:42,325
Because we lived in a society

277
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,916
where every means was used
to prevent apartheid from,

278
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,006
you know, coming to an end,

279
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:53,506
this album somehow had in it...

280
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:59,593
lyrics that almost set us free
as oppressed peoples.

281
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,388
Any revolution needs an anthem

282
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:06,231
and in South Africa
<i>Cold Fact</i> was the album

283
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,771
that gave people permission

284
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:13,948

and to start thinking differently.

00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:20,302
<i>The majority of the population

307

<i>and forced out of the commerce in areas.</i>

308
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,678
<i>It was what had happened
in Nazi Germany.</i>

309
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,638
<i>It was a spin-off from Nazi Germany,</i>

310
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,687
<i>but if a newspaper published it,
they'd get prosecuted.</i>

311
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:34,816

achieved a pariah status in the world.</i>

you could do about it,

'cause the government was very strict.

If you spoke out against apartheid,

328
00:23:12,611 --> 00:23:14,311
it was like a voice spoke to them

329
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:18,364
<i>and said, "Guys, there's a way out.
There's a way out.

330
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:21,484
<i>"You can write music.
You can write imagery.

331
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,152
<i>"You can sing, you can perform".

332
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:26,990
And that was where, really,
the first opposition to apartheid

333
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,666
came from inside
the Afrikaans community.

334
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:33,212
It was these young Afrikaans guys
and, to a man,

335
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:35,752
they'll tell you
they were influenced by Rodriguez.

336
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,004
<i>Koos Kombuis. Willem Möller.</i>

337
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,881
<i>The late Johannes Kerkorrel.</i>

338
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:45,509
<i>The guys who were regarded as the
icons of the Afrikaans music revolution

339
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,052
will all tell you,
"Rodriguez was our guy".

340
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:49,850
(speaking Afrikaans)

341
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,724
<i>(Möller)
We call it the Voelvry movement</i>

342
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:56,352
<i>of Afrikaans artists
singing against apartheid.</i>

343
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:59,234
All of us listened to Rodriguez
at some point. All of us.

344
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:01,357
<i>It had an enormous impact.</i>

345
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,943
<i>It made you just think
that there's another way.</i>

346
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:08,240
What's presented to you
by the establishment isn't all theirs.

347
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:10,082
(rock music playing)

348
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:16,798
# <i>Set if off, set if off</i>
# <i>Set if off, set if off</i>

349
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:19,421
<i>(Möller) The biggest hit
was a song called</i> Set It Off

350
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:22,795
<i>which was when PW Botha
was the president then.</i>

351
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:26,724
The real bad guy. When he came on TV,
he used to talk like that.

352
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,974
<i>And this song said, "switch it off,
just switch off the TV".</i>

353
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,147
<i>(male interviewer)
So what lines do you think</i>

354
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,823
<i>were the lines they had problem with?

355
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,400
Ah, gee whiz, it's all of them.

356
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,619
"Sugar Man, won't you hurry
Cos I'm tired of these scenes

357
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:52,116
"For a blue coin, won't you bring back
all those colours to my dreams?"

358
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:53,993
The most difficult ones is probably

359
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:58,456
"Silver magic ships, you carry
Jumpers, coke, sweet Mary Jane".

360
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,173
And what is that?

361
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,126
Uh...

362
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:03,840
I'm gonna leave that to you.

363
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,341
(both chuckle)

364
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:07,844
<i>- But it's drugs?</i>
- It's certainly drugs.

365
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:11,848
During the apartheid years,
it was just impossible to play it.

366
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,850
<i>And what happened if you did play it?

367
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:17,103
Well, you couldn't.
I'd like to show you why.

368
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:24,858
Right, here we have the album,
the vinyl.

369
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,490
At the back of the sleeve
you'll see a sticker that says "Avoid".

370
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:32,285
But when you open the album
and take it out from its sleeve,

371
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:36,502
you would see that they have
scratched that particular song

372
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:40,293
with a sharp tool to make sure
that it would not go out on air.

373
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:45,337
<i>And that's the way that they
banned the music which, in my mind,</i>

374
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:50,137
<i>was quite a brutal way of ensuring the
song would never be heard on the air.</i>

375
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:54,136
<i>(Steve Harris) Most of those tracks
were on the banned list at SABC</i>

376
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,564
<i>and they ran
the broadcast industry completely.</i>

377
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:00,392
<i>There weren't any independent
radio stations or TV stations.</i>

378
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:06,199
Obviously, when that word got out,
it just made the record more desirable.

379
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:09,026
You know,
it's like having something banned.

380
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:12,576
You're 16, 17 years old
and you've got something that's banned.

381
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,577
It was absolutely perfect.

382
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:17,163
(# <i>Can't Get Away</i> by Rodriguez)

00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:37,555

# <i>That you can't get away from it</i>

390
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:02,671
# <i>No, you can't get away</i>

391
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:06,842
<i>(Segerman)</i> Cold Fact <i>was just one
of the albums we had in our collections,</i>

392
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:11,218
<i>and for 10, 20 years, it was just
a record we listened to and enjoyed.</i>

393
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,430
<i>But then a pivotal event happened</i>
<i>that changed everything for me.</i>

394
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:16,977
<i>We were down in Camps Bay beach.</i>

395
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:20,181
<i>We were sitting around on the beach
and a friend of mine,

396
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:22,562
a woman, who was from South Africa,

397
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:26,862
but she had got married
and emigrated to Los Angeles,

398
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:31,317
<i>she said to me, "Where can I
buy</i> Cold Fact <i>in South Africa?"</i>

399
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,246
And I turned round and I pointed
to a store across the road

400
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,574
that sold CDs and I said,
"You can buy it at that store".

401
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:42,252
She said, "Really? Because, you know,
you can't buy it anywhere in America.

402
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,546
"I've asked everywhere in America,
no one's even heard of it".

403
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:47,124
<i>And that was a pivotal moment,
'cause I didn't know that.</i>

404
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,584
<i>I thought everybody knew Rodriguez,</i>

405
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,216
<i>especially in America
'cause he was American.</i>

406
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:54,424
<i>So my next thought was,
"Ah, Rodriguez, that's interesting".</i>

407
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,929
<i>I went back... I came back home
and I took out my Rodriguez records</i>

408
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:59,432
<i>and that's when I realised
there was nothing on the record</i>

409
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,684
<i>to tell us who he was
or where he was from.</i>

410
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,932
On <i>Cold Fact</i> there are four names.

411
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:06,895
On the front cover
it just says "Rodriguez".

412
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:09,776
But if we take the record out
and examine the sleeve,

413
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:12,696
<i>the artist's name is Sixto Rodriguez.

414
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,276
<i>But if you look at the tracks,</i>

415
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,986
<i>six of these tracks</i>

416
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:18,447
<i>are credited to Jesus Rodriguez,</i>

417
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,907
<i>and four of these tracks</i>

418
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:22,618
<i>are credited to Sixth Prince.</i>

419
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,374
<i>So who actually wrote these songs</i>

420
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:25,705
<i>and who are all these people?</i>

421
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:28,961
<i>We didn't have any more information
than a record</i>

422
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:32,591
<i>with him sitting on the cover
with a hat and sunglasses on.</i>

423
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:35,673
<i>We didn't know how tall he was
'cause he was sitting cross-legged.</i>

424
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:37,224
<i>So how do you solve a mystery?</i>

425
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:39,301
<i>You use whatever
information's available.</i>

426
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:42,684
<i>What did we have?
A record cover with lyrics.</i>

427
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:44,436
So we started looking
quite deeply at the lyrics

428
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:45,982
and seeing what they said,

429
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:48,686
and some of them, very few of them,
had geographical references.

430
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:51,397
The one <i>You Can't Get Away</i>
starts off,

431
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,107
"Born in the troubled city

432
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:55,989
"In Rock and Roll, USA".

433
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:57,490
Born in which troubled city?

434
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,663
Seems all the cities were troubled
in the late '60s.

435
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,036
"In the shadow of the tallest building".

436
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:04,288
The tallest building, as far as we knew,
was in New York.

437
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:06,712
And at the bottom of the song
this verse says,

438
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:08,414
"In a hotel room in Amsterdam".

439
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:14,337
Then it says, "Going down a dusty
Georgian side road I wander". Georgia?

440
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,342
So we've had Amsterdam,
we've had Georgia,

441
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,889
we've had the world's tallest building.

442
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:20,266
Not much to go on.

443
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,484
<i>(Bartholomew-Strydom)
Well, what I heard,</i>

444
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:30,898
<i>and the story differs a lot,</i>

445
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:34,614
<i>and a lot of people have different
versions of the story, but what I heard,</i>

446
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,443
<i>he hadn't played</i> a <i>concert</i>
<i>in</i> a <i>very long time.</i>

447
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:41,367
And a promoter got him
to play a concert,

448
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,120
and he was hoping
it was gonna be a great show.

449
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:47,328
Of course, the show didn't
work out that way. It started out...

450
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:51,461
The sound wasn't good.
The venue wasn't good.

451
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:54,130
A lot of the factors
surrounding the show wasn't good.

452
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,086
And as the show went on and on,

453
00:29:56,169 --> 00:30:00,766
it started going downhill from there.
People started ridiculing him.

454
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:06,143
People started whistling
or making mention of the fact that,

455
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,599
you know,
the show wasn't going as planned.

456
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:12,277
And it got to a point where,
just very quietly, very gently,

457
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:13,820
he just sang his last song.

458
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:16,569
"But thanks for your time
Then you can thank me for mine

459
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,616
"And after that's said forget it".

460
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:23,038
And he reached down and
pulled up a gun and pulled the trigger.

461
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:26,787
<i>And that was the dramatic,
very dramatic ending,

462
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:29,461
<i>to what was actually a non-career.

463
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:04,660
(Segerman) In 1996,
the South African record label

464
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:08,959
released Rodriguez's second album,
<i>Coming From Reality</i>,

465
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:11,875
on CD for the first time
in South Africa.

466
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:14,502
And because they thought
I knew a lot about him,

467
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:17,217
they asked if I wanted to co-write
the liner notes for the booklet,

468
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,669
which I did.

469
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:23,132
And I'll read some of it to you.
They start off by saying,

470
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:26,640
"If ever there is an air of intrigue
and mystery around a pop artist,

471
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,437
"it is around the artist
known as Rodriguez.

472
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:32,642
"There's no air of intrigue and mystery
around him anywhere else in the world

473
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,853
"because his two albums,
<i>Coming From Reality</i> and <i>Cold Fact</i>,

474
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:38,735
"were monumental flops everywhere else".

475
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:40,282
And this is the important part.

476
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:44,953
"There were no concrete cold facts
about the artist known as Rodriguez.

477
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:47,451
"Any musicologist detectives out there?"

478
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:50,747
And that,
that's the line that changed everything.

479
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,666
<i>(Bartholomew-Strydom)
I started searching for Rodriguez</i>

480
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,964
<i>when a few of us
were sitting around in the Army</i>

481
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,417
<i>and somebody said,
"How did Rodriguez die?"</i>

482
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,877
And just coincidence,

483
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,383
at the time I was looking
for subject matter to write an article.

484
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:05,341
<i>I remember having, like, five points
on a piece of paper.</i>

485
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:08,769
<i>And number four, or something,
was "Find out how Rodriguez died".</i>

486
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:11,597
<i>I thought it would make a good story.</i>

487
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,690
So that was in the back of my mind
for many years

488
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:17,520
and then, many years later,
I came across this, um,

489
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:23,409
re-release of <i>Coming From Reality</i>
and inside, the liner notes said,

490
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:26,862
"There were no concrete cold facts
about the artist known as Rodriguez.

491
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:31,576
"Any musicologist detectives out there?"
Um, was the question,

492
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:33,786
and I think that to me,
was like an invitation.

493
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:35,963
I thought, "Well, maybe it's me".

494
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:42,761
<i>The first way I tried to find him
was to just follow the money.</i>

495
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:44,088
Normally, you follow the money.

496
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,589
That's how you get
to the bottom of anything.

497
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:48,600
<i>But where do dead men's money go?</i>

498
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:51,053
<i>I was astounded that
no one knew anything about him.</i>

499
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:55,479
<i>I guess it was reminiscent
of how bad the music industry was.</i>

500
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:57,400
<i>They were renowned
for ripping people off.</i>

501
00:32:57,476 --> 00:33:01,401
And it is one thing,
if they had said to me, "Oh, yeah,

502
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:05,826
"we send the money
to X place or Y," or whatever,

503
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:08,199
but they just kept on being very vague.

504
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:12,033
<i>And, in fact, when I put some pressure
on somebody, I did get an address,</i>

505
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,617
<i>and I called</i>

506
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,670
<i>and, I can't remember
if I spoke to someone or left a message,</i>

507
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:19,665
<i>but when I called the next day,
the number had been changed.</i>

508
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:20,836
<i>And that to me was...</i>

509
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:24,341
I mean, that's a gift
for anyone who wants to be a detective,

510
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,891
is an obstacle,
because an obstacle is an inspiration.

511
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,639
If you just find things easily,
they're not inspiring,

512
00:33:31,735 --> 00:33:34,935
and this was a great obstacle that
somebody had changed their number.

513
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:39,439
I just smelt a dirty money story
somewhere there.

514
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:41,236
<i>(male interviewer)
So, if you compare to other artists,</i>

515
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:42,938
<i>how big was it actually?</i>

516
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,069
<i>(Robbie Mann) Every month it just sold.</i>

517
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:48,027
<i>And every party you went to
and every place you went to,</i>

518
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,532
<i>you'd hear that album at least once.</i>

519
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:54,992
I don't think I could even think
of how many albums he's sold here

520
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:57,544
'cause it's a long period of time.

521
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:00,710
<i>(male interviewer)
What could be probable?

522
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,716
(sighs)

523
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:08,013
I'd have to guess. Maybe half a million
copies over that period of time.

524
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:11,766
<i>It's a lot of records,
especially for a small country.</i>

525
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:14,310
<i>Gold record, ten times over.</i>

526
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:17,139
<i>(male interviewer) Rodriguez never got
to know that he was big in South Africa.

527
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:18,732
<i>How could that be?

528
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:22,023
Don't know.
I mean, everything would have been...

529
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:23,695
I find that strange.

530
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:26,023
<i>I have no idea.

531
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:28,154
<i>(male interviewer) But you must
have sent royalties somewhere?</i>

532
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:30,903
<i>(Mann) Of course we sent royalties.
We sent royalties to A&M Records.</i>

533
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:33,284
<i>I remember the label. It was A&M Sussex.</i>

534
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:36,287
<i>Whether they had a partnership,
whatever they had, I don't... You know.</i>

535
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:41,129
So, my suggestion is, if you
can find out whoever the person was

536
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,877
who owned Sussex Records,

537
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:46,376
<i>then you will find out
what happened to the money.

538
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:49,178
<i>(male interviewer)
Because it's weird, isn't it?</i>

539
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:52,425
<i>(Mann) It's very strange. Very strange.</i>

540
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,760
<i>(male interviewer) How popular
was the album? Was he as famous as,</i>

541
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,932
<i>you know,
the Rolling Stones and the Doors?

542
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,805
Oh, it was much bigger
than Rolling Stones.

543
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:00,356
Absolutely, at the time, yeah.

544
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,769
<i>(male interviewer) When you released
the record, did you try to contact him?</i>

545
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:07,652
<i>(Harris) No, not at all. You know?
Because... because, at the time,

546
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:11,781
the legend... the legend was...
here was an artist.

547
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,744
This was like Jimi Hendrix.

548
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:16,456
With Jimi Hendrix catalogues,
you've gotta understand,

549
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:21,958
if you just got Jimi Hendrix and you'd
got the license for this territory,

550
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:25,462
you're obviously not gonna go try get
hold of Jimi Hendrix, because he's dead.

551
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,464
<i>- But who did you pay royalties to?</i>
- To Sussex Music.

552
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:29,920
<i>To Clarence?

553
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:33,257
Yes. Well, to Sussex Music
which is his company, yeah.

554
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,592
So, I decided to make a diagram.

555
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:38,812
Write down the whole path
and trail that I was trying to work out.

556
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:41,561
All the various touch points,
all the record companies,

557
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,065
all the people that had dealings with
Rodriguez and his album at some point.

558
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,066
<i>I made this whole document.</i>

559
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,773
<i>So I found out there were three
record companies in South Africa</i>

560
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:52,276
<i>that had released Rodriguez's records.</i>

561
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,030
<i>Finally discovering that
led to a record company in America.</i>

562
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,910
<i>It was a company that
had been signing Rodriguez</i>

563
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,833
<i>and creating his first album
called Sussex.</i>

564
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,708
<i>I then did my research on Sussex.</i>

565
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:05,960
<i>That led me to discovering</i>

566
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:10,465
<i>who the owner of Sussex Records was:
Clarence Avant.</i>

567
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:12,841
<i>Clarence Avant,
he'd been the head of Motown,</i>

568
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:16,467
<i>one of the most prestigious jobs
to have in the record company industry.</i>

569
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:20,270
So I did my research. I tried everything
to get a hold of Clarence Avant,

570
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:23,812
but I just got to a lot of closed doors.
I could not get a hold of him.

571
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:39,281
<i>(male interviewer) I don't know
if you've ever seen this picture.</i>

572
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:42,034
(chuckles) That's him.

573
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:46,042
That's Rodriguez.

574
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,878
I don't know when this was made.
I have absolutely no idea.

575
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:52,882
<i>- That's 1970, I think.</i>
- Yeah.

576
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:57,178
This is my man.

577
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:03,893
Man, don't get me emotional again. Shit.

578
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,310
You made me emotional once.

579
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:08,902
I ain't getting emotional no more
sitting here talking to you, man.

580
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:14,779
<i>If I had to name ten artists
that I have ever been involved with,</i>

581
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:17,611
<i>Rodriguez would be in the top five,
simple as that.</i>

582
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:19,742
<i>There's nothing...
You never heard anything like him.</i>

583
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:23,200
<i>People would say, "Well, Bob Dylan".</i>
<i>I said, "No, no".</i>

584
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:27,629
<i>Bob Dylan was mild to this guy.
Did it make any money?</i>

585
00:37:27,704 --> 00:37:30,002
We judge singing here in America...

586
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:33,502
If you say,
"Is it... Was it the top hundred?

587
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:37,761
"Was it... was it number...
Did it get on the charts as number 12?

588
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:41,264
"Was there a lot of radio play?"
The answer's, "No, man".

589
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,854
Nobody didn't... Rodriguez?

590
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,691
You know, that name didn't register.

591
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:52,355
Although he looked like he was
a white guy but, even still, Rodriguez,

592
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:55,358
everybody knew Rodriguez,
that's a Spanish name.

593
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:58,281
A Latin name.
Latin music was not happening then.

594
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,862
<i>(male interviewer) How many records
do you think he sold in America?

595
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:03,198
In America'? Six.

596
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:05,292
Maybe my wife bought it,
maybe my daughter bought...

597
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:09,041
She couldn't buy it, but maybe
Neil Bogart, maybe Dennis and Mike.

598
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:13,383
Hey, look, man, you know,
it didn't sell here.

599
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:16,886
<i>There was some excitement about him.</i>

600
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:21,387
<i>Couple of agents heard him
and wanted to bring him to California</i>

601
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:24,556
<i>and, you know, when he came
to California he was nervous,</i>

602
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:26,725
<i>and he turned his back to the audience</i>

603
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:29,065
<i>and everybody said,
"Well, what the hell is this?"</i>

604
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:30,559
<i>(male interviewer)
But the thing is that the guy sold</i>

605
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:33,395
<i>hundreds of thousands of records
in another country.</i>

606
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,739
<i>(Avant) I'm going to South Africa to try
to chase somebody who's selling records?</i>

607
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,236
<i>Shit, no, man.</i>

608
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:39,906
<i>(male interviewer) But did you know
that he was big in South Africa?</i>

609
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:44,907
Rodriguez, young man, never happened
insofar as I'm concerned.

610
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,408
Period.

611
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:50,829
<i>But if I'm really gonna try to track
down the money, how should I do it?

612
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:53,415
Well, is that important, the money?
Or is Rod--

613
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:58,922
Which is important? Rodriguez's story
or you worrying about the money?

614
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,596
How many people in South Africa?

615
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:03,432
40 million? 40 thousand?
40 million people? How many people?

616
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,018
40 million people live in South Africa.

617
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:08,723
Well, so they've been freed
for how long? Three hours?

618
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,273
So what the fuck's
that supposed to mean?

619
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:12,939
You told me at lunch,
they scratch records

620
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,686
because they wouldn't let the lyrics...

621
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:18,273
So the underground movement,
how big was it? How big was it?

622
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:20,947
<i>(male interviewer) He sold
half a million records in South Africa.</i>

623
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,865
So he sold half a million records.
So what?

624
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:24,696
I don't know who he sold them to.

625
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:27,623
How many distributors did he have?
I have no idea.

I'm out of business.

<i>I've even setup a web page

00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:34,850
<i>(Bartholomew-Strydom)
So basically I was lost.</i>

649
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,692
<i>I'd come to a dead end.
I couldn't find him.</i>

650
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,277
<i>I didn't know where to look any more.</i>

651
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:40,697
<i>I'd even visited the places
that he sang about.</i>

652
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,861
<i>I'd been to London. Nothing.</i>

653
00:40:42,957 --> 00:40:47,033
<i>I'd been to Amsterdam.
He sings about Amsterdam. Nothing.</i>

654
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,955
<i>And one day I'd basically given up.</i>
<i>I thought, "Well, this is it".</i>

655
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:52,875
And one day, just by accident,
I was listening to the album in the car

656
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,040
and I heard the song <i>Inner City Blues.</i>

657
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,292
<i>Great song. And the line came up.</i>

658
00:40:57,372 --> 00:41:01,127
<i>"I met a girl in Dearborn,
early six o'clock this morn.</i>

659
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:02,711
<i>"A cold fact".</i>

660
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:05,798
<i>Then I thought, "Hang on a minute".
I 'd never checked out Dearborn.</i>

661
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,803
<i>I didn't even know if it was a city
but then I thought,</i>

662
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,725
<i>"Actually that sounds
like a town or a city".</i>

663
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:13,556
And I thought, "Hang on,
let me check it out in an atlas".

664
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:18,731
So I went through to my old atlas
and pulled it out.

665
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:22,071
I thought, "Let me see
what I could find here.

666
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:24,566
"Let me see if I could find Dearborn".

667
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,405
Um... Dear...

668
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:31,365
Then I found it.
Dearborn, Wayne, Michigan. F7.

669
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:37,583
F... 7.

670
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:42,756
Dearborn. Part of Detroit. That was
a huge breakthrough in my mind.

671
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:47,510
Detroit, home of Motown,
Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder,

672
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:51,096
and, eventually, Mike Theodore,
the producer of the album.

673
00:41:55,930 --> 00:42:00,106
<i>(Theodore) I was sifting in my condo,
just having a cup of coffee.</i>

674
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:04,106
<i>I was looking out the window
watching the ocean. Phone rings.</i>

675
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,942
It's a long-distance call

676
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,614
from South Africa...

677
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:13,077
from a writer whose name's
Craig Bartholomew,

678
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:19,080
<i>and he starts telling me
this amazing story.

679
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:22,123
<i>So he said, "Do you know that Rodriguez</i>

680
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:25,127
<i>"has been selling in South Africa
for 25 years.</i>

681
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:27,549
<i>"His albums are selling millions".</i>

682
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,552
<i>I said, "What?"</i>

683
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:33,476
<i>Then he's sitting there and he wants...
he starts telling me some stories.</i>

684
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,645
He said, "How did Rodriguez die?"

685
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:39,979
And he's telling me information
that he had that Rodriguez had...

686
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,148
blown his brains out on stage,

687
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,480
or set himself on fire
and killed himself.

688
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:48,032
I had 100 questions I wanted to ask.

689
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:51,828
I was just hoping I could get
all my questions in, you know.

690
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:54,413
"Why did he write this lyric?
Why did he write that lyric?

691
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:58,585
"Where did he record this album?
Where did he record that album?"

692
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:02,505
And we got talking and I asked him
a lot of questions and it was amazing.

693
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:05,501
It was a rollercoaster ride
of questions and answers,

694
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,845
and it was a euphoric moment
of just having finally broken through

695
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:10,383
and discovered something.

696
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:14,384
And finally I got to the one question
I wanted to know the answer of, was,

697
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:18,559
"How did Rodriguez die?
Did he blow himself up on stage? Or...

698
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:21,228
"What is this dramatic story?

699
00:43:21,224 --> 00:43:25,900
"Let's open up the lid on this
right away, and find out what happened".

700
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:30,696
And Mike Theodore said,
"What do you mean dead? He's not dead.

701
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:34,905
"Sixto is alive. He's alive and kicking.

702
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:40,707
"The principal artist known as
Sixto Rodriguez is alive and kicking

703
00:43:40,827 --> 00:43:42,204
"and living in Detroit".

704
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:49,552
<i>(Harris) I... I can't remember who
called me and said, "They've found him".</i>

705
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:55,222
I said, "No. You're shitting me.
This isn't... No". (laughs)

706
00:43:55,842 --> 00:44:00,097
<i>At first I thought it was a hoax.
I thought somebody was faking it.</i>

707
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:04,726
You know, it's like going
into Tutankhamen's tomb

708
00:44:04,851 --> 00:44:06,228
and finding the mummy.

709
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:07,729
You know, it was like, "Wow, he lives".

710
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:11,274
I remember dancing on the spot
when I was staying on the phone.

711
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:13,545
And Craig and I were
jumping up and down saying,

712
00:44:13,546 --> 00:44:15,146
"We found him, we found him".

713
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:17,739
It was the most exciting thing.
We'd actually done it.

714
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,907
(# <i>I Think of You</i> by Rodriguez)

715
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:25,129
# <i>Just a song we shared out here</i>

716
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:30,756
# <i>Brings memories back
when you were here</i>

717
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:37,092
# <i>Of your smile, your easy laughter</i>

718
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:42,897
# <i>Of your kiss, those moments after</i>

719
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:45,976
# <i>I think of you</i>

720
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:50,654
<i>(Bartholomew-Strydom) So that was it.</i>

721
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:53,490
<i>I'd come to the point,
it was the end of the story.</i>

722
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:57,613
<i>I was searching for a dead man.
One morning I discovered a living man.</i>

723
00:44:57,612 --> 00:45:00,661
And to me that was the end of the story.
I wrote my article,

724
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:03,125
I called it "Looking for Jesus".

725
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,619
I faxed it to many individuals,

726
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:05,791
many people involved,

727
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:10,629
but somehow this article
made its way across the Atlantic

728
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:13,128
and into the hands
of someone in America.

729
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:15,971
And what I thought was the end of story

730
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,682
was actually just the beginning
of another story,

731
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:21,302
and the best part was still to come.

732
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:26,190
'Cause I don't know where it is.
It might take a while.

733
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:28,310
They do have the dates.

734
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:31,188
"Three-year search for dead singer".
Yes.

735
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:34,657
August '97. I was in Kansas.

736
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:38,495
I got a copy of it to me at work.
I was on, like, a 24-hour shift.

737
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:40,830
And then, I went online

738
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:45,164
and that's when
I discovered the website.

739
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:49,039
When I went online there was
this milk carton with a picture.

740
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:54,716
And it said, "Wanted"
and "Have you seen this man?"

741
00:45:55,378 --> 00:45:58,348
I was like, "Matter of fact,
I have seen him before".

742
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:04,396
I replied, "Rodriguez is my father.
I'm serious.

743
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:07,689
"Do you really want to know
about my father?

744
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:11,357
"Sometimes the fantasy
is better left alive".

745
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:13,525
I don't know why I said that,
but anyway I did.

746
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:17,367
And then I gave them e-mail address,
phone numbers,

747
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:20,703
anything that they wanted to contact me.
And he phoned me.

748
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:28,373
<i>(Segerman) Well, we'd found out
that Rodriguez was alive.</i>

749
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:29,871
<i>I'd spoken to Craig.</i>

750
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:32,714
<i>I came to work and Alex McCrindle,

751
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:34,755
<i>who was the guy I worked
on the website with said,

752
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:38,220
"You're not going to believe
what's on the website".

753
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:41,887
And on the website was a forum
where people could post messages,

754
00:46:42,008 --> 00:46:43,555
and there was a message that said,

755
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:46,225
<i>"My name's Eva.
I'm Rodriguez's daughter".

756
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:47,722
<i>She'd left a phone number and she said,</i>

757
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:49,099
<i>"I'd like to speak to someone</i>

758
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,566
<i>in connection with this".</i>

759
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:52,777
<i>So that night I phoned her.</i>

760
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:55,442
I said, "Hi, I'm Sugar,"
and she said, "I'm Eva,"

761
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:58,066
and we had the most
amazing conversation.

762
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:02,241
She explained to me who her father was,
what he had done, where he had been.

763
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:05,911
She asked me who I was
and I explained why my name was Sugar

764
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:08,409
and how I was involved with the website.

765
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:10,628
<i>And then at the end I said to her,</i>

766
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:13,088
<i>"This has been the most
amazing thing for me,</i>

767
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,923
<i>"and what would be really great
is if I could,</i>

768
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:16,758
<i>"at some point, speak to your dad.</i>

769
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:18,799
<i>"I'd love it if I could
just say hello to him".</i>

770
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:21,468
<i>Because, for me,
this was sort of the end of the search</i>

771
00:47:21,464 --> 00:47:23,432
<i>and I just wanted to speak to this man.</i>

772
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:25,426
And then I went to bed.

773
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:28,646
And 1:00 in the morning that night,
the phone rang.

774
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:33,105
And my wife answers it
'cause it was her side of the bed.

775
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:37,776
And I remember she picked up the
phone and her face just changed.

776
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:41,948
She had this look of awe.
She said, "It's him".

777
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:44,116
And I was in shock. I'd been sleeping

778
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:47,331
and I ran into the other room,
into my study,

779
00:47:47,423 --> 00:47:49,826
and I picked up the phone
and she put hers down.

780
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:52,499
And I said, "Hello?" and a voice said...

781
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,463
<i>(Rodriguez's voice on phone)
"Hello, is that Sugar?"</i>

782
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:58,301
And I knew, I just knew,
because I knew that voice.

783
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:01,967
I'd heard that voice so many times
on the records, I knew it was him.

784
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:03,805
I was talking to Rodriguez.

785
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:08,136
<i>That, for me, was one of
the greatest moments of my life.</i>

786
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:20,966
<i>- (Rodriguez) Whenever you're ready.
- (male interviewer) Okay.</i>

787
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,214
<i>(Rodriguez) Is this all right?
Should I be doing something though?</i>

788
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:26,594
<i>Should I have a glass of water
or something? Is that right?</i>

789
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:29,934
<i>- (male interviewer) Do you want?</i>
- Yeah. I like that.

790
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:32,803
Yeah, this is...
I'm supposed to be comfortable.

791
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:47,076
So run the question to me again.
Just so I can hear it in my head.

792
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:52,620
<i>In the '70s and '80s, did you ever
get any contact from South Africa?

793
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:55,167
Uh... No, I didn't.

794
00:49:57,161 --> 00:50:01,291
Maybe they didn't have a contact
number or something but, no, I didn't.

795
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:03,588
<i>How does that feel?
You weren't aware of something

796
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,795
<i>that would have changed
your life completely.

797
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,264
<i>I mean, probably to the better.

798
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:11,430
Well, I don't know if it would have been
for the better,

799
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:14,763
but it's certainly a thought, you know.

800
00:50:15,638 --> 00:50:19,359
<i>But wouldn't it have been nice to know
that you were a superstar?

801
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:20,810
Uh, well...

802
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:27,946
I don't know how to respond to that.

803
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:32,326
<i>After</i> Coming From Reality,
<i>did you wanna continue making albums?</i>

804
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:36,326
I would have liked to have continued
but nothing beats <i>Reality.</i>

805
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:38,794
So I pretty much went back to work.

806
00:50:39,662 --> 00:50:41,130

it was a family guitar,

935
01:00:01,932 --> 01:00:07,029

01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:14,028
and they came to the club
to see me play.

938
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:18,032
I had a gig at a place called The Sewer,

939

right out by the Detroit River,

940
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:24,459

"I promise you, just come here.
You won't be disappointed".

969
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:01,969
<i>(Emmerson)
He's working his ass off in Woodbridge.</i>

970
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:05,643
One day, be brought this picture
of himself on a milk carton.

971
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:07,816
(chuckles)

972
01:02:07,933 --> 01:02:12,609
And he'd say, "Emmerson, look at this.
You know, they're looking for me".

973
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:17,992
I said,
"Really? Why is that, Rodriguez?"

974
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:22,076
<i>Next day he says,
"Emmerson, I gotta go on tour".</i>

975
01:02:22,656 --> 01:02:25,000
<i>I said, "Come on, Rodriguez,</i>
<i>are you serious?"</i>

976
01:02:25,116 --> 01:02:26,993
<i>(Rian Malan) Because I'm a journalist,
I doubted it.</i>

977
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:29,917
<i>That sort of thing does not happen
in the rational universe.</i>

978
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:32,840
<i>It does not happen.
It's against the laws of God and nature.</i>

979
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:35,336
<i>This guy is coming to tour here,
he must be an imposter.</i>

980
01:02:35,335 --> 01:02:38,179
It's a clever public relations scam.

981
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:41,801
Actually, not even a clever
public relations scam. It's a stupid...

982
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:46,389
'Cause it so obviously can't be true.
Only idiots would believe it. They...

983
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:50,183
But I was wrong.

984
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,528
<i>(Regan) We were always anxious,
of course, to get off the plane.</i>

985
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:02,074
<i>That was a long flight.</i>

986
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:05,700
But we got off the plane
and we put our bags on our backs

987
01:03:05,699 --> 01:03:11,081
and, you know, they were heavy and
we just kept moving towards the airport.

988
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:15,584
And suddenly,
three, two limousines pulled up

989
01:03:17,669 --> 01:03:19,592
and we were sure
that they weren't for us.

990
01:03:19,713 --> 01:03:22,557
We were like kind of
walking around them.

991
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:25,223
Like, "Oh, we better get out
of these people's way

992
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:27,721
"'cause they're important people
in limos".

993
01:03:27,721 --> 01:03:30,725
But they were for us.
And that's when it began.

994
01:03:30,724 --> 01:03:34,729
<i>It was all another world.
It was another world.</i>

995
01:03:34,853 --> 01:03:40,075
<i>(Eva) Just like you would see people...
over Madonna or...</i>

996
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:45,618
Like stepping out into the wind
and the paparazzi and all the...

997
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:51,586
you know, the production assistants
and everybody are there to welcome him

998
01:03:51,703 --> 01:03:54,923
and take us into the VIP suite.

999
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:59,261
<i>(Regan) The white carpeting.
You know, that was something that

1000
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:03,803
never would we ever even dream
of walking on white carpeting,

1001
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:05,971
especially in your shoes. (laughs)

1002
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:09,479
<i>(Segerman) They put him in a limo
and they drove him into the city.</i>

1003
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:14,318
<i>And along the way, on all the lampposts,
were placards advertising the concert.</i>

1004
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:17,271
And he saw his face on every lamppost
as it sped by

1005
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:19,819
and he'd go,
"There I am, there I am, there I am".

1006
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:22,818
<i>(Eva) So we came
and we got to meet all the people.</i>

1007
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:26,617
<i>We got to meet Craig Bartholomew
and their family and their kids</i>

1008
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:28,615
<i>and Stephen Segerman.</i>

1009
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:32,461
And everybody was just so happy.
Everybody was thrilled.

1010
01:04:32,452 --> 01:04:33,920
We were even happier.

1011
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:35,831
<i>(Möller) Stephen phoned me.

1012
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:38,174
<i>He said, "You will never believe this...

1013
01:04:39,459 --> 01:04:41,632
"but Rodriguez is coming to South Africa

1014
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:43,471
"and we can be the opening band.

1015
01:04:43,463 --> 01:04:47,093
"Do you wanna do it?"
I said, "Of course we wanna do it".

1016
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:51,475
"Why? Where is he?"
"Now they found him.

1017
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:55,146
"They found him, he's alive, he's gonna
come and tour in South Africa".

1018
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:59,317
"Are we gonna be the opening band?"
So I couldn't really believe this.

1019
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:05,490
And then I got all the information:
he's living in Detroit and everything.

1020
01:05:05,485 --> 01:05:07,203
And then a little while later he said,

1021
01:05:07,195 --> 01:05:09,823
"Look, it turns out
he hasn't got a band.

1022
01:05:09,948 --> 01:05:13,498
"Could we be the support band?"
I mean his band.

1023
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:18,002
I remember, even then, we were sort of,

1024
01:05:19,499 --> 01:05:21,376
"Is this really gonna be Rodriguez?"

1025
01:05:21,376 --> 01:05:24,004
We'll only know
if he can actually sing these songs.

1026
01:05:24,129 --> 01:05:27,383
I mean, we don't know.
What if it's just some guy? (chuckles)

1027
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:29,008
<i>(Sandra) It was just like</i>

1028
01:05:29,134 --> 01:05:30,351

1029
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:32,641

1031
01:05:35,974 --> 01:05:38,853
<i>thinking it was just all very shocking.</i>

1032
01:05:38,977 --> 01:05:41,196
<i>I don't know, he took to it really easy.</i>

1033
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:43,565
<i>He just walked in and did his thing</i>

1034
01:05:43,565 --> 01:05:47,195
<i>and I was amazed that he did so well.</i>

1035
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:48,194

1036
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:49,366

1037
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:53,208
<i>He's a little bit too much grounded.</i>

1038
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:54,910
<i>He didn't take advantage</i>

1039
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:57,037
<i>of all the amenities and stuff.</i>

1040
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,919
He didn't sleep in the big
double king size bed.

1041
01:05:59,914 --> 01:06:03,760
He kinda curled up on the love seat
and I found him there and...

1042
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:07,255
Yeah, he just didn't think somebody
should have to make another bed

1043
01:06:07,255 --> 01:06:09,257
because he messed it up or...

1044
01:06:09,257 --> 01:06:10,634
<i>(Regan) There was a time</i>

1045
01:06:10,717 --> 01:06:12,765
<i>where I stayed in the house we were at</i>

1046
01:06:12,886 --> 01:06:15,389
<i>and everyone else had gone out.</i>

1047
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:17,099
<i>The phone rang and it kept ringing,</i>

1048
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:19,317
<i>so I decided to answer it.</i>

1049
01:06:19,392 --> 01:06:20,769
<i>And it was a reporter

1051
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:25,782
and set up time for an interview.

1052
01:06:26,483 --> 01:06:31,284

after I told her to call back later

1053
01:06:31,279 --> 01:06:33,657
to talk to someone
'cause I couldn't help her,

1054
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:38,337
she told me that she wanted to know,
between she and I,

1055
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:40,334

from the airport, when he arrived,

1061
01:06:52,467 --> 01:06:56,142
and we were actually in the middle
of a song when he walked in

1062
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:58,936
and just took over the microphone
and finished the song.

1063
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:01,484
We switched off the CD player

1064
01:07:01,476 --> 01:07:04,320

1135
01:12:11,536 --> 01:12:14,710
<i>(Bartholomew-Strydom) I thought
I would see him being bewildered</i>

1136
01:12:14,789 --> 01:12:17,292
<i>at all these people staring up at him.</i>

1137
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:20,845
<i>I saw the opposite.
I saw this absolute tranquility.</i>

1138
01:12:20,837 --> 01:12:24,512
<i>There was absolute serenity on his face.
Total.</i>

1139
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:28,849
<i>It's like he had arrived at that thing,
at that place</i>

1140
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:31,223
<i>he'd tried to find his whole life.</i>

1141
01:12:31,305 --> 01:12:33,649
<i>(Segerman) Home is acceptance.</i>

1142
01:12:34,058 --> 01:12:37,562
<i>Here's a guy who'd lived somewhere
else, on the other side of the earth,

1143
01:12:37,645 --> 01:12:40,899
<i>and it was almost as if
he had found his home.</i>

1144
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:42,900
<i>(Bartholomew-Strydom)
And I looked around at all these people</i>

1145
01:12:42,984 --> 01:12:46,659
<i>and I thought, "This is
a once-in-a-lifetime experience.</i>

1146
01:12:46,737 --> 01:12:49,786
<i>"This is never going to happen again".</i>

1147
01:13:23,190 --> 01:13:25,067
(inaudible over cheering)

1148
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:42,919
<i>(Malan) Well, isn't this all
our great fate?</i>

1149
01:13:42,919 --> 01:13:47,846
<i>Your dreams of yourself, the higher
forms of yourself is that one day

1152
01:13:56,098 --> 01:14:00,604
I mean, most of us die
without coming anywhere close

1153
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:03,781

1154
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:05,233

1156
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:08,114

1157
01:14:08,194 --> 01:14:10,413
<i>and I got absolutely nothing back.</i>

1158
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:12,081
<i>Absolutely nothing back.</i>

1159
01:14:12,156 --> 01:14:13,373
<i>And I couldn't tell whether</i>

1160
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:15,622
<i>he was just like sort of cripplingly shy</i>

1161
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:16,827
<i>or whether I was</i>

1162
01:14:16,911 --> 01:14:18,037
<i>asking the wrong questions</i>

1163
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:19,167
<i>or there was a language barrier</i>

1164
01:14:19,246 --> 01:14:20,463
<i>or whatever. He just...</i>

1165
01:14:20,581 --> 01:14:25,587
Maybe that was OK as well
because he preserved his mystery.

1166
01:14:25,670 --> 01:14:27,718
I walked away
from that interview saying,

1167
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:30,679
<i>"This is all too strange to be true".

1168
01:14:30,758 --> 01:14:33,386

1169
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:34,721
<i>"These are the days</i>

1172
01:14:58,869 --> 01:15:01,122
<i>(Rodriguez) Oh, they were so sweet.</i>

1173
01:15:01,205 --> 01:15:03,378
<i>I didn't believe it.</i>

1174
01:15:03,457 --> 01:15:06,210
<i>And I still don't, but the thing is...</i>

1175
01:15:06,293 --> 01:15:12,016
So when I went on stage
5,000 seats all set up,

1176
01:15:12,008 --> 01:15:14,352
white seats, and the thing is...

1177
01:15:14,677 --> 01:15:17,271
And I said, "This is..."

1178
01:15:18,556 --> 01:15:23,187
<i>So when I played a show, they jumped</i>
<i>out of their seats and rushed the stage.</i>

1179
01:15:24,895 --> 01:15:29,071
<i>South Africa made me feel like
more than a prince.</i>

1180
01:15:29,734 --> 01:15:33,079
<i>(Eva) And then signing the autographs
for, like, a couple of hours.</i>

1181
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:37,291
<i>I mean, just the line of people
bringing their guitars to be signed,</i>

1182
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:39,414
<i>bringing their CDs and...</i>

1183
01:15:39,493 --> 01:15:40,961
<i>(Regan) The most amazing thing I'd seen</i>

1184
01:15:41,037 --> 01:15:43,916
<i>was the man with his tattoo</i>
<i>of the</i> Cold Fact.

1185
01:15:43,998 --> 01:15:48,128
<i>He was a Rodriguez impersonator.
That just stoked my fire.</i>

1186
01:15:48,127 --> 01:15:51,222
<i>I was like,
"Man, that is just too crazy".</i>

1187
01:15:54,091 --> 01:15:56,310
I have with me here,
presented to Rodriguez

1188
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:58,308
for sales of the album <i>Cold Fact.</i>

1189
01:15:58,429 --> 01:16:00,306
(whooping and cheering)

1190
01:16:04,268 --> 01:16:06,145
Now just tell the States that,
OK, will you?

1191
01:16:06,145 --> 01:16:07,613
(all laughing)

1192
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:11,985
American singer Rodriguez
is certainly alive and well

1193
01:16:11,984 --> 01:16:14,328
and with us in the Front Row tonight.
Welcome.

1194
01:16:14,445 --> 01:16:15,913
Very kind. How are you?

1195
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:18,912
I've heard some really riveting tales
about your "death".

1196
01:16:18,991 --> 01:16:21,995
I mean, they range from you pouring
petrol all over yourself on stage

1197
01:16:22,078 --> 01:16:27,084
and committing suicide to taking
a drug overdose and dying in prison.

1198
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:42,982
<i>(Eva) Yeah, it was a beautiful,
beautiful dream</i>

1199
01:16:44,975 --> 01:16:47,694
<i>and then you gotta go back. (laughs)</i>

1200
01:16:47,812 --> 01:16:50,440
My dad said he's got two lives.

1201
01:16:51,524 --> 01:16:55,700
The carriage turns into the pumpkin bus
or something. It's like...

<i>(male interviewer)
Did people in Detroit believe you</i>

1203
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:01,375
<i>when you came back

1204
01:17:01,367 --> 01:17:05,497
You know, people in Detroit
need to hear something good.

1205
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:08,378
<i>I'm not sure how much of it
they believed</i>

1206
01:17:08,374 --> 01:17:10,877
<i>because it is a grandiose story.</i>

1207
01:17:12,044 --> 01:17:13,637
It sounds like something
you would make up

1208
01:17:13,712 --> 01:17:16,966
if you were bragging on some dream
or something.

1209
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:20,473
<i>(Ferretti) He was really quite famous.</i>

1210
01:17:20,553 --> 01:17:23,227
<i>He'd be, you know,
tearing down this old shack</i>

1211
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:26,900
<i>or he'd be sweeping up filth or dirt</i>

1212
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:30,066
<i>and he started to show me one day,
and I didn't believe him,</i>

1213
01:17:30,146 --> 01:17:33,992
<i>about the album
and how it got to be so popular.</i>

1214
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:35,739
Somebody had a bootleg copy
of this thing

1215
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:37,908
and it spread around and everyone...

1216
01:17:37,987 --> 01:17:42,663
It got to be so popular
that children could recite it

1217
01:17:42,741 --> 01:17:47,087
and sing the song word for word...
all of the songs word for word.

1218
01:17:47,163 --> 01:17:50,588
And I had never heard of the album
and I said, "Can you get me an album?"

1219
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:52,088
And he couldn't even get me one.

1220
01:17:52,168 --> 01:17:55,012
I mean, that's how
obscure of a thing it was.

1221
01:17:55,087 --> 01:18:00,093
But he had all these photos and stuff,
with these giant crowds,

1222
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:03,096
20,000 people,
like Woodstock or something.

1223
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:04,772
Like, "Are you kidding me? That's you?"

1224
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:09,102
<i>I thought it was Photoshopped
or something. I didn't believe him.</i>

1225
01:18:09,185 --> 01:18:12,860
<i>But he had all these giant crowds
and he was quite content</i>

1226
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:16,613
<i>to just go and sweep up people's lawns</i>

1227
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:20,614
<i>or clean up and do manual labor.
He stayed.</i>

1228
01:18:21,614 --> 01:18:27,121
He lives a very, very, very modest life.

1229

1230
01:18:31,123 --> 01:18:33,296
<i>There's definitely no excess,</i>

1231
01:18:34,752 --> 01:18:39,883
<i>and he definitely still works hard
in order to make ends meet.</i>

1232
01:18:40,591 --> 01:18:46,473
<i>And there's no glamour to his life
in that sense.</i>

1233
01:18:46,472 --> 01:18:49,146
<i>(male interviewer)
But he must be a rich man today?</i>

1234
01:18:49,241 --> 01:18:51,314
<i>(Regan) No.</i>

1235
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:55,318
<i>Rich in a lot of things
but perhaps not material things.</i>

1236
01:18:55,397 --> 01:18:57,741
<i>I guess it just never got to that.</i>

1237
01:18:57,816 --> 01:18:59,409
<i>(male interviewer) But he's sold
hundreds of thousands of records</i>

1238
01:18:59,485 --> 01:19:00,987
<i>in South Africa.</i>

1239
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:02,408
Well, yes.

1240
01:19:03,489 --> 01:19:07,289
But I believe there's a great deal
of perhaps bootlegging,

1241
01:19:08,494 --> 01:19:11,714
piracy, such like that. Perhaps...

1242
01:19:12,957 --> 01:19:15,176
Perhaps other people are rich.
