1
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,445
Santiago.

2
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:12,698
Get your things.

3
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:14,867
Now.

4
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,328
Now.

5
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,832
Quickly.

6
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,712
What are you waiting for?

7
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:22,559
Halt.

8
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,395
Remain where you are.

9
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,275
This is the United States border patrol.

10
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:32,819
Remain where you are.

11
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:40,452
Remain where you are.

12
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,331
Santiago.

13
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,250
Leave the ball.

14
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,962
Leave the stupid ball. Come on.

15
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:53,090
This is the United States border patrol.

16
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:06,436
Los Angeles. Ten years later

17
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:21,577
Santiago.

18
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,203
Stop goofing off.

19
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:25,455
Load up the truck.

20
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,666
Right now.

21
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:45,100
He's so hot.

22
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,803
Santiago. Where have you been?

23
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:24,806
We're already one down.

24
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,099
Only one?

25
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:27,768
How's the diet going?

26
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,102
What are you doing?

27
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:30,729
I don't want anybody hurt.

28
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,731
No shin pads. No game. Get off.

29
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,797
See you.

30
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,110
Hey.

31
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,282
How did you do? You play well?

32
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:09,953
Well. We won 4-2. Scored a couple.
Should have got another one.

33
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,580
In Spanish.

34
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,457
What's the deal with Dad?

35
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,043
He wants to buy a truck of his own.

36
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,628
Why?

37
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,672
So you can work for yourselves.

38
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:23,050
Munez and son. Eh?

39
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,677
That's what he wants for us?

40
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,971
- There's always plan B.
- Which one is that?

41
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:31,058
The American Dream.
We win the lottery.

42
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,145
What happened?

43
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:36,647
He wants too much.

44
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,108
Too bad.

45
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:45,072
You have to eat something.

46
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:47,074
Hey.

47
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:57,334
Hey. Boss. I've been a busboy now
for six months. Why can't I be a waiter?

48
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,295
This Chinese restaurant.
You're not Chinese.

49
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:02,840
So? This is America.
You're American. I'm American.

50
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:06,635
- You have green card?
- If I had one. Could I be a waiter?

51
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:08,804
No. You're not Chinese.

52
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:51,346
Tommy. Hold your position.

53
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,891
Tommy. You're supposed
to be on the wing.

54
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,268
It's not the Cup Final.
He's seven years old.

55
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,145
You're never too young. Val.

56
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,856
To be honest. I don't think
Tom's that into soccer.

57
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,941
That's b... Oh.

58
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:05,068
Go.

59
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:08,113
- Hey. Watch out.
- Go on. Tom.

60
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,996
Thanks.

61
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:41,188
- He's quite a player.
- Yes. He is.

62
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:46,693
- Did you teach him to do that?
- God taught him.

63
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:54,243
He doesn't look right.
His balance is all wrong.

64
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:56,662
Doesn't look up enough.

65
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:58,455
Doesn't lift his legs high enough.

66
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:01,542
That's what all the other teams think.

67
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:07,756
Then that happens.

68
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,351
Well played. Son.

69
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:21,562
Do you ever play professional?

70
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:27,901
Well... pro teams go for college kids and...
none of us went to college.

71
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:31,196
- When's your next game?
- Saturday.

72
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,325
There's someone I bumped into
on the plane on the way over here.

73
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:38,370
I want him to see you play.
He's a sports agent.

74
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:41,498
I'm serious. I think you're worth it. Son.

75
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,834
Listen. No offence.
But I need to get to work.

76
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,420
I used to play a bit myself.

77
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:49,673
- Yeah? Where?
- England.

78
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:53,093
I was a scout too.
I know what I'm talking about.

79
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:56,013
- England?
- What's your name. Son?

80
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:59,141
- Santiago Munez.
- Glen Foy.

81
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:05,522
I'll see you Saturday. Santiago.

82
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:14,573
Man.

83
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:23,665
Movie stars have agents.

84
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:26,460
What's an agent
supposed to do with you?

85
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:28,670
Do you know something?

86
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:31,006
Your boy's really good.
He could be a star.

87
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,425
Don't you get it?

88
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:36,220
There are two types of people
in this world.

89
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:38,639
Those that live in big houses

90
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:40,807
and people like us.

91
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:44,436
Who cut their lawns
and wash their cars.

92
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:48,524
That could change
if I become a professional player.

93
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:50,817
What are you saying?

94
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:53,737
You play in a park with a bunch of guys

95
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,447
who work in a car wash.

96
00:10:55,531 --> 00:11:03,372
I don't know. Meet this guy and
everything could change. For the better.

97
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:07,709
I know how to make things better.

98
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:11,630
We buy a truck.
We make our own business.

99
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:14,508
The rest is rubbish.

100
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:18,303
Another beer.

101
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:29,690
Baseball. Tennis. Soccer. Basketball.
All at the touch of a button.

102
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:34,027
Experience the thrill of the game from
the comfort of your home environment.

103
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:36,947
- Barry. Is this a good moment?
- No time like the present.

104
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,659
So he's a young Mexican kid
from the barrio.

105
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:45,038
He dazzled me. I tell you. Barry.
As you know. I don't dazzle easily.

106
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:48,584
The last time was a young kid
called Jermain Defoe.

107
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:53,672
- I'd rather not talk about that. Glen.
- So he's playing on Saturday afternoon.

108
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:55,465
Some college downtown.

109
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:58,635
Right. Tell me exactly where it is
and I'll be there 110%.

110
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:01,597
- Glad to hear it.
- Oh. Hello. Now.

111
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,017
Why don't you knock yourself out
and help yourself to finger food?

112
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,145
Probably don't do sashimi in Gateshead.
Do they. Mate?

113
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,522
See you later.
Yes. Bruv.

114
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:13,025
- Would you like some sashimi?
- I'm in LA.

115
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:45,057
Whoo. Come on. Santiago.

116
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:04,326
Come on. Back.

117
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:19,842
Val. Let me use your phone.

118
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:24,346
Yo.

119
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:27,182
Glen. Glen. Mate.

120
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:30,894
Glen. I'm not a dickhead.
I didn't forget. No.

121
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:35,190
I'm in a business meeting. Bruv. I'm in
a meeting. I'm in a meeting all morning.

122
00:13:35,274 --> 00:13:40,779
Yeah. Sorry. Listen. Mate. Do us a favour.
Can you send me a tape of your boy?

123
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:43,782
Glen. Glen. GI...

124
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,454
Pillock.

125
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:02,551
Goal. Yes.

126
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:09,474
Yeah. Come on. Come on.

127
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:27,451
Hey. Grandma.

128
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:31,580
Santiago. Well played. Son. Well done.

129
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:34,124
Thank you. Thank you.
This is my little brother.

130
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:37,503
- Hello. How are you? Pleased to meet you.
- And this is my grandma.

131
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:39,922
- This is my daughter Val.
- Hi.

132
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:42,007
So you are the agent?

133
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,801
No. No. No. No.
This man arranged for the agent to come.

134
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:49,640
And he didn't. I'm afraid.
He's... you know. He's too busy.

135
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:52,726
So he'll come to the next game?

136
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,395
No. No. I'm afraid he can't.

137
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:58,941
He's flying back to England tomorrow.
So am I.

138
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:02,319
Look at that.
Maybe the old man is right.

139
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:05,239
You dare to dream. Get screwed.

140
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:09,576
Thanks anyway.

141
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:31,223
- Hello. Who is this?
- This is Glen Foy.

142
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:34,351
Glen Foy? Do I know you. Mr Foy?

143
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:39,022
Uh... Well. I was one of your scouts
when you first took over.

144
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:44,403
You fired me. Actually. Well. You brought in
the new regime. I don't hold it against you.

145
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:49,283
Oh. You don't? So why are you calling me
at half past three in the morning?

146
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:52,119
Sorry. I'm in California.

147
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,458
I've just seen a young player.
I think he's a remarkable talent.

148
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:05,090
- Who does he play for?
- Oh. Just local league. Kickabout stuff.

149
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:10,345
The point is. I'm on a plane home tomorrow
and I want you to make me a promise.

150
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:14,725
If he turns up on your doorstep.
Will you see him?

151
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:18,812
- You want me to promise you this. Right?
- Aye.

152
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:23,150
Just give him a run out.
That's all I'm asking.

153
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:25,611
If I say yes. Can I go back to sleep?

154
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:28,447
Yes. Mr Dornhelm.

155
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,532
Then yes. Mr Foy.

156
00:16:42,628 --> 00:16:44,671
- Santiago.
- Hey.

157
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:48,383
- How are you doing?
- Fine. Thank you. Why are you here?

158
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:51,261
Your coach told me where to find you.

159
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:53,472
Who's this?

160
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:56,016
The man from England
who watched me play football.

161
00:16:56,099 --> 00:17:00,062
If you get yourself to England.
Newcastle United will give you a trial.

162
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:02,189
Newcastle United?

163
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:05,359
- That's a big club.
- A very big club.

164
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:07,861
What is this bullshit?

165
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:12,157
You think you are going to
play football in England?

166
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:15,410
He thinks I'm good enough.

167
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:18,580
Why you fill him with ideas like this?

168
00:17:18,664 --> 00:17:21,166
Who the hell do you think you are?

169
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:26,630
And you. Why don't you keep your feet on
the ground instead of your head in the sky?

170
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:35,597
It's a big thing you ask. Senor.

171
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:40,018
He's supposed to fly halfway
across the world on something you say?

172
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:45,399
The manager's made me a promise.
He'll give him a trial. The rest is up to him.

173
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:48,402
- Look in my eyes and answer me this.
- Grandma.

174
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:51,321
Can Santi make it as a professional?

175
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:53,782
Aye. I believe he can.

176
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:57,995
Dad. We've gotta go. If the freeway's busy.
You're gonna miss your flight.

177
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:01,540
Here's my card.
It's all my numbers.

178
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:03,709
Think about it. Give me a ring.

179
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:05,878
It's good to meet you.

180
00:18:06,879 --> 00:18:08,881
Good to see you.

181
00:18:41,497 --> 00:18:43,874
You got enough?

182
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:50,172
- Enough what?
- Everyone knows the money's in the boot.

183
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:52,591
So are you going?

184
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:57,179
- Grandma thinks I should.
- What does Dad think?

185
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:59,431
I haven't asked him.

186
00:18:59,515 --> 00:19:01,517
How far away is England?

187
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:04,269
Right now?

188
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,191
400 bucks too far.

189
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:11,360
Go back to sleep.

190
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:12,611
Now.

191
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:36,552
There?

192
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:02,744
Thanks.

193
00:20:25,184 --> 00:20:27,227
How could you do this. Dad?

194
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:29,396
I paid 4500 for the truck.

195
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:31,815
I took 1200 of yours.

196
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:34,193
But I'm giving you half the business.

197
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:36,320
That's a good deal.

198
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:37,613
You stole that money.

199
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:39,114
Stay out of this. Mother.

200
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:41,116
You knew what it was for.

201
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,536
- Two more weeks and I have enough.
- For what?

202
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,747
To chase a stupid dream?

203
00:20:47,748 --> 00:20:52,336
Big-time ballplayer in England.
Come on. It's bullshit.

204
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:56,173
And when you fail. How are you
gonna come back with no papers?

205
00:20:56,256 --> 00:21:00,177
One chance. And you think I should
just give it up for what you do?

206
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,347
What I do is take care of my family.

207
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:08,352
In Mexico. I work construction.
At night. I clean up in a brothel.

208
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:11,104
But I save enough to bring us to America.

209
00:21:11,188 --> 00:21:14,608
And when your mother walk out on us...
No. When she walk out.

210
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:17,194
- I hold this family together.
- Leave her out of this.

211
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:21,365
I make enough for this house
and now we have our own business.

212
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:25,077
That's how things get better.
That's how you measure a man's life.

213
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,704
It's your life.

214
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:32,084
Not mine.

215
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:54,147
Gavin.

216
00:21:57,276 --> 00:21:59,278
Gavin. Gavin.

217
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:08,412
Ladies and gentlemen.
This is a very good day for the club.

218
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:10,706
Gavin is a very gifted player

219
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:15,085
and should fit in very well
with our set-up here at St James' Park.

220
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:19,840
I'm very pleased to present him... with this.

221
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,515
Winning the league's out of sight. Erik.

222
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:32,102
What are your realistic goals
for the rest of the season?

223
00:22:32,186 --> 00:22:37,024
Finishing in the first four and qualifying for
Europe. It's essential for a club like this.

224
00:22:37,107 --> 00:22:41,987
To do that. You're gonna have to take
maximum points from your next games.

225
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:45,240
Look. The club has had
some problems lately. Yeah.

226
00:22:45,324 --> 00:22:47,326
But...

227
00:22:47,993 --> 00:22:50,621
I'm here now. Yeah.

228
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:56,293
And I'm not in it for fame
or money or anything like that.

229
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:58,837
I like to win matches.

230
00:22:58,921 --> 00:23:02,007
So maximum points
shouldn't be a problem.

231
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,675
Eh. Boss?

232
00:23:42,381 --> 00:23:43,924
Where's your father?

233
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:46,385
He's gone to get a part for the truck.

234
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:47,928
Good.

235
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:50,055
He doesn't have to hear this.

236
00:23:53,684 --> 00:23:56,520
Train ticket to San Diego.

237
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:01,191
Bus ticket to Mexico City.

238
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,486
Mexico City?

239
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,029
Yes.

240
00:24:06,113 --> 00:24:09,241
You can't fly to London
from Los Angeles.

241
00:24:09,992 --> 00:24:12,286
You're illegal.

242
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:14,788
This is your ticket.

243
00:24:14,872 --> 00:24:18,041
It's dated one week from now.

244
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:20,127
Grandma. How did you pay for this?

245
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:26,925
I've worked all my life.
I have savings.

246
00:24:27,885 --> 00:24:29,595
What did you sell?

247
00:24:29,845 --> 00:24:30,804
What did you hock?

248
00:24:33,724 --> 00:24:36,852
Old things. From the past.

249
00:24:37,811 --> 00:24:40,522
So now do I get a room to myself?

250
00:24:40,606 --> 00:24:42,399
Come here.

251
00:24:44,234 --> 00:24:46,862
Who's gonna help with your homework?
You won't do it.

252
00:24:46,945 --> 00:24:48,697
He'll do it.

253
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:53,202
Take a shower before you leave.
You smell real bad.

254
00:24:53,285 --> 00:24:56,288
- Am I leaving tonight?
- Sure.

255
00:24:56,371 --> 00:24:58,499
Before your father gets home.

256
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:03,921
When your mother walked out on us.

257
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:08,800
I promised God I'd do everything
to help you boys follow your dreams.

258
00:25:13,263 --> 00:25:16,225
You deserve this chance. Santiago.

259
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:24,566
Take it.

260
00:25:46,338 --> 00:25:49,967
Passengers making
connecting flights from Mexico

261
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:53,554
should proceed to gate 14.

262
00:25:53,637 --> 00:25:56,723
- Purpose of your visit?
- Excuse me?

263
00:25:56,807 --> 00:26:00,310
- Business or pleasure?
- Business.

264
00:26:01,895 --> 00:26:05,399
I play... I play soccer... football.

265
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:08,861
I hope to. For Newcastle United.

266
00:26:11,113 --> 00:26:13,448
One moment.

267
00:26:16,535 --> 00:26:19,454
This young man wants to play
for your team. Mr Henderson.

268
00:26:19,538 --> 00:26:21,623
Newcastle?

269
00:26:21,707 --> 00:26:23,167
Yes. Sir.

270
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,461
Need all the help we can get.

271
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:30,841
Glen. Phone.

272
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,222
Hello.

273
00:26:37,306 --> 00:26:39,391
Who?

274
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:40,767
Santiago.

275
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:43,061
You're in England? Where?

276
00:26:43,145 --> 00:26:45,564
Uh... Somewhere in London.

277
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:47,649
So. Glen...

278
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:50,194
how do I get to Newcastle?

279
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:31,860
Hey. How's it going?

280
00:27:31,944 --> 00:27:36,240
Why didn't you call me from LA?
Let me know you were coming?

281
00:27:36,323 --> 00:27:38,992
- Is it OK that I'm here?
- Oh. No. No. It's fine.

282
00:27:39,076 --> 00:27:42,955
Just caught me a bit off guard. That's all.

283
00:27:45,123 --> 00:27:48,168
Well. You'd best stay with me
till you get settled.

284
00:27:48,252 --> 00:27:50,838
- OK.
- Welcome to the Toon.

285
00:27:52,381 --> 00:27:54,633
- What is that?
- It's where the Geordies live.

286
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:58,804
- What is a Geordie?
- Someone that lives in the Toon.

287
00:27:58,887 --> 00:28:01,056
You've a lot to learn. Bonny lad.

288
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:04,351
<i>You mean toons. Like Looney Tunes
and stuff? Like Bugs Bunny?</i>

289
00:28:25,706 --> 00:28:27,708
Thank you.

290
00:28:29,168 --> 00:28:31,503
- You live here alone?
- Aye.

291
00:28:31,587 --> 00:28:34,173
Well. My daughter you met.

292
00:28:34,882 --> 00:28:40,095
- Do you have a wife?
- She died a couple of years ago - cancer.

293
00:28:42,723 --> 00:28:44,933
I'm sorry.

294
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:51,481
My grandma...

295
00:28:51,565 --> 00:28:53,692
She sent you this.

296
00:28:53,775 --> 00:28:55,777
Oh. It's...

297
00:28:56,695 --> 00:28:59,698
She has it since she's a little girl.

298
00:29:01,867 --> 00:29:04,661
I'm not much of a Catholic. Mind.

299
00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:07,164
She thinks you're a good man. So...

300
00:29:11,585 --> 00:29:14,379
Santiago. Your dinner's ready.

301
00:29:14,463 --> 00:29:16,465
Santiago.

302
00:31:10,579 --> 00:31:12,873
I thought you worked in football.

303
00:31:12,956 --> 00:31:16,919
Not any more. I was finished a while back.
Like some of these cars.

304
00:31:17,002 --> 00:31:20,964
- You fix 'em?
- Aye. I fix them. Restore them.

305
00:31:21,048 --> 00:31:26,345
Listen. There'll not be anyone
at the club till ten o'clock.

306
00:31:26,428 --> 00:31:30,349
So why don't you get yourself something
to eat? Some breakfast or something?

307
00:31:30,432 --> 00:31:33,185
- Yeah.
- Do you have any money?

308
00:31:33,268 --> 00:31:35,771
No. But I'm OK.

309
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,069
- No. I can't.
- It's OK.

310
00:31:43,028 --> 00:31:45,697
Take it. Turn right.

311
00:31:45,781 --> 00:31:47,783
Just for now.

312
00:31:50,118 --> 00:31:52,496
Here. Mate. Watch the ball.

313
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:54,581
Oh. No.

314
00:32:00,629 --> 00:32:04,132
Hey. Mister. Can we have wor ball back?

315
00:32:06,218 --> 00:32:09,596
- Quite tasty.
- Aye. If you work in a circus.

316
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:13,141
- I'm done. Sorry. Here.
- Nice one.

317
00:32:14,101 --> 00:32:16,728
I hear some players
have a problem with Gavin Harris.

318
00:32:16,812 --> 00:32:18,981
- Divvent like his attitude.
- Aye.

319
00:32:19,064 --> 00:32:22,234
Well. Three clubs in five years
should tell you something.

320
00:32:22,317 --> 00:32:25,279
I think he's better playing on the inside.

321
00:32:25,362 --> 00:32:27,573
If he's in a mood. He gets lost out wide.

322
00:32:27,656 --> 00:32:29,533
Aye. Right enough. Like.

323
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:33,704
What are you looking at?

324
00:32:33,787 --> 00:32:36,540
Sorry. But you're
talking about soccer. Right?

325
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:39,543
- No.
- Football?

326
00:32:39,626 --> 00:32:42,713
Oh. Aye. Yeah.
That's all there is to talk about.

327
00:32:42,796 --> 00:32:44,882
- Where are you from. Son?
- Los Angeles.

328
00:32:44,965 --> 00:32:49,261
Oh. Aye? You know Charlize Theron?
She's a cracker. Like.

329
00:32:49,344 --> 00:32:53,849
- What are you doing up here?
- I have a tryout for Newcastle United.

330
00:32:53,932 --> 00:32:57,311
- A trial. Like? Howay.
- Are you serious. Lad?

331
00:32:57,394 --> 00:32:59,396
Yeah. Yeah. Maybe today. Actually.

332
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:02,608
You wanna lay off the black pudding. Son.

333
00:33:04,568 --> 00:33:08,739
- What is it exactly?
- You don't want to know.

334
00:33:10,491 --> 00:33:14,536
Football's a religion here. London has any
number of teams. Same in the Midlands.

335
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:19,041
Manchester. You've got two. Liverpool.
You've got two. Glasgow's got two.

336
00:33:19,124 --> 00:33:21,835
Up here. Though. It's just the Toon.

337
00:33:23,879 --> 00:33:25,714
There she is.

338
00:33:38,894 --> 00:33:42,397
- Is that the manager?
- Erik Dornhelm. Mr Dornhelm.

339
00:33:42,481 --> 00:33:44,733
He can be intimidating.
Look him in the eye.

340
00:33:44,816 --> 00:33:47,903
I don't think my look will make a difference.

341
00:33:47,986 --> 00:33:53,075
- It'll be my feet.
- Mr Dornhelm. Excuse me. Glen Foy.

342
00:33:53,158 --> 00:33:55,661
This is the young man
I was telling you about.

343
00:33:55,744 --> 00:33:58,413
- Hi.
- He's from Los Angeles.

344
00:33:59,706 --> 00:34:01,917
Santiago Munez.

345
00:34:03,168 --> 00:34:05,170
When was this?

346
00:34:06,171 --> 00:34:08,340
When I phoned you
in the middle of the night.

347
00:34:08,423 --> 00:34:10,634
You promised to give him a trial.

348
00:34:10,717 --> 00:34:13,262
Yes. One minute. Please.

349
00:34:14,596 --> 00:34:17,224
Like that?
Score a hat trick. You can have it.

350
00:34:17,307 --> 00:34:22,145
I'm sure you have a watch and I'm
absolutely sure it's an expensive one.

351
00:34:22,229 --> 00:34:24,064
What time does it say?

352
00:34:24,147 --> 00:34:27,901
Sorry. Boss. I was dropping a shirt off
for a sick kid in hospital.

353
00:34:27,985 --> 00:34:31,822
The PR people should have had a camera.
Would have been a really good photo op.

354
00:34:31,905 --> 00:34:38,287
That. I think. Is bullshit. There are six
journalists inside. Waiting for 15 minutes.

355
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,914
Get in there.

356
00:34:40,998 --> 00:34:45,544
- And today. You train with the reserves.
- Oh. F...

357
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:51,758
- Where do you play?
- Los Angeles.

358
00:34:51,842 --> 00:34:54,136
I meant position.

359
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:57,723
Yeah. For my team. I play up front.
But I prefer midfield.

360
00:34:57,806 --> 00:35:00,475
That way. I see more of the ball.

361
00:35:05,564 --> 00:35:08,609
Get him over to the training ground.
Let's see what he's got.

362
00:35:08,692 --> 00:35:11,111
Will do. Thank you very much.

363
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:22,706
Hey. I'll be around.

364
00:35:45,354 --> 00:35:49,233
Oh. You're there.
How are you feeling. Son?

365
00:35:49,316 --> 00:35:53,195
- OK.
- Good. Mal Braithwaite. Club coach.

366
00:35:53,278 --> 00:35:56,782
I've been a friend of Glen's
since he played here. So I'm on your side.

367
00:35:56,865 --> 00:35:58,700
- All right?
- Yeah. Thank you. Sir.

368
00:35:58,784 --> 00:36:01,078
I'm not a sir. I'm a coach.

369
00:36:01,161 --> 00:36:05,624
Sir is the gaffer. That's who's gonna
be watching you today. All right? Fit?

370
00:36:05,707 --> 00:36:07,709
- Yeah.
- Good. Let's go.

371
00:36:10,546 --> 00:36:14,091
Come on. It'll be fine.

372
00:36:15,634 --> 00:36:16,969
Yeah.

373
00:36:20,055 --> 00:36:23,058
- Come on.
- Get up the field.

374
00:36:24,393 --> 00:36:26,937
- Behind you.
- Keep moving it.

375
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,064
Put it square.

376
00:36:29,147 --> 00:36:30,816
Son.

377
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:33,986
I want you midfield. On the right. OK?

378
00:36:34,069 --> 00:36:36,071
- Gavin... You know who Gavin is?
- No.

379
00:36:36,155 --> 00:36:37,739
- Slot in behind him there.
- OK.

380
00:36:37,823 --> 00:36:40,242
That's the fella. OK?

381
00:36:40,325 --> 00:36:44,246
- Get Adie off.
- Adie. Come off.

382
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:50,627
OK. Pal. Swap bibs with him.
Do your best.

383
00:36:53,922 --> 00:36:56,717
Hey. Mal. Mal. Who's the muppet?

384
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,720
He's from Mexico. Be gentle. Son.

385
00:36:59,803 --> 00:37:02,139
Yeah. I'll look after him.

386
00:37:06,018 --> 00:37:07,644
Hey. Yo. Hey. Yo. Yo.

387
00:37:20,115 --> 00:37:21,992
That's it. Phil.

388
00:37:22,534 --> 00:37:27,247
- How are you. Mal? Bobby. How are you?
- All right. Boss?

389
00:37:27,831 --> 00:37:31,752
Franny. Bring the kid into the game.

390
00:37:44,515 --> 00:37:46,266
Look at me.

391
00:37:48,185 --> 00:37:50,270
Here. Yo. Yo.

392
00:37:51,563 --> 00:37:53,148
Oh. Fuck.

393
00:37:57,194 --> 00:38:00,239
- What? A bit louder. Please.
- Oh. Come on.

394
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,033
Here.

395
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:15,254
All right. Let me call you back.

396
00:38:49,163 --> 00:38:51,498
Let the kid take it.

397
00:38:57,546 --> 00:38:59,548
Go on. Have a go.

398
00:39:01,008 --> 00:39:03,677
Face up. How many?

399
00:39:11,768 --> 00:39:13,687
Adios. Amigo.

400
00:39:18,108 --> 00:39:20,152
Santiago.

401
00:39:22,321 --> 00:39:25,073
Get yourself a shower.

402
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:10,994
I don't know. Glen.

403
00:40:11,078 --> 00:40:15,374
My legs wouldn't do
what my brain was telling them.

404
00:40:15,457 --> 00:40:18,669
I'll be better tomorrow. I promise.

405
00:40:18,752 --> 00:40:22,506
There's not gonna be
a tomorrow. Santiago.

406
00:40:26,385 --> 00:40:28,387
Get in the car.

407
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:53,036
You know. My father believes
people have a place in life.

408
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,622
You work. You feed your family.

409
00:40:55,706 --> 00:40:57,416
You die.

410
00:40:59,459 --> 00:41:02,963
And it's foolish to think otherwise.

411
00:41:12,931 --> 00:41:15,893
- Excuse me. Sir...
- I had a word with the fellow on the door.

412
00:41:15,976 --> 00:41:21,607
He said I could come in and just look
for someone. I won't be a second.

413
00:41:24,401 --> 00:41:28,113
Mr Dornhelm.
Glen Foy from this morning.

414
00:41:28,197 --> 00:41:32,451
Listen. I'm sorry
to interrupt the proceedings.

415
00:41:32,534 --> 00:41:34,786
Have I missed all the boring speeches?

416
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:38,540
I'm making one of the "boring" speeches.
This distraction is not welcome.

417
00:41:38,624 --> 00:41:41,960
Well. If you'd answered my calls.
I wouldn't be here.

418
00:41:42,044 --> 00:41:46,798
- What do you want?
- Listen. This kid. Santiago Munez.

419
00:41:46,882 --> 00:41:50,469
- Would you like to sit here?
- Sure. Thanks.

420
00:41:50,552 --> 00:41:53,263
Listen. He's grown up
in poverty and hardship

421
00:41:53,347 --> 00:41:56,767
and his only way out
is his skill with the ball.

422
00:41:56,850 --> 00:42:00,437
He's flown 6.000 miles on my say-so.

423
00:42:00,521 --> 00:42:03,065
He's jet-lagged. He's nervous.

424
00:42:03,148 --> 00:42:07,820
You know. He's never seen mud before
and you put him on a pitch like that.

425
00:42:07,903 --> 00:42:11,573
And then you spend
the whole time on your mobile.

426
00:42:11,657 --> 00:42:17,329
- I saw him flat on his ass most of the time.
- Yet there was one moment of magic.

427
00:42:18,705 --> 00:42:21,208
When he took the ball on the bounce.

428
00:42:21,291 --> 00:42:24,628
- Turned Magowan. Took it down.
- I saw it.

429
00:42:27,381 --> 00:42:31,385
Looks good.
Hear they do you well here.

430
00:42:31,468 --> 00:42:33,637
Listen. When I was a scout.

431
00:42:34,555 --> 00:42:37,057
I used to spend the whole time.
On muddy days.

432
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:41,311
Watching young lads
clogging the shite out of each other.

433
00:42:41,395 --> 00:42:47,109
And just once in a while. There'd be one
that'd come along and lift your heart.

434
00:42:47,192 --> 00:42:49,820
Like this lad.

435
00:42:51,363 --> 00:42:53,699
Just give him a month.

436
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:34,364
Ah. So you found all my yesterdays?

437
00:43:34,448 --> 00:43:36,533
I was just looking.

438
00:43:37,326 --> 00:43:39,828
My wife made this scrapbook.

439
00:43:39,912 --> 00:43:42,873
You never told me
you were a major-league player.

440
00:43:42,956 --> 00:43:47,127
Aye. Well. Not for as long as I'd have liked.

441
00:43:47,211 --> 00:43:50,506
- Why?
- Got an injury. Did my knee in.

442
00:43:51,465 --> 00:43:55,260
Look at that.
Shorts were shorter. Hair was longer.

443
00:43:55,344 --> 00:43:58,472
Didn't make £8 million a year. Either.

444
00:44:00,182 --> 00:44:02,309
- But you were still heroes.
- Oh. Aye.

445
00:44:02,392 --> 00:44:06,146
Footballers have always been heroes.
Even in my father's day. Earning £8 a week

446
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:09,775
and working down the mine
at the same time.

447
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:15,531
- There you go.
- No. I can't accept it. It's too special.

448
00:44:15,614 --> 00:44:17,908
I'm not giving it to you.
Just try it on.

449
00:44:17,991 --> 00:44:21,370
I want to see what you look like
in the black and white.

450
00:44:21,453 --> 00:44:23,914
- What's the point?
- What's the point?

451
00:44:23,997 --> 00:44:26,667
Well. You've got a month's trial.

452
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:34,049
Better phone your granny again.

453
00:44:45,269 --> 00:44:49,523
Right. Listen up. You lot.
This is Santiago Munez. He's from Mexico.

454
00:44:49,606 --> 00:44:52,192
- No. Los Angeles.
- Los Angeles. Whatever.

455
00:44:52,276 --> 00:44:55,487
Before this day's done.
I want you to let him know who you are.

456
00:44:55,571 --> 00:44:57,823
OK. Right. Let's get to it.

457
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:03,871
Push it hard. Hard.

458
00:45:07,207 --> 00:45:10,794
Nice one. Franny.
Nice work. Come on.

459
00:45:10,878 --> 00:45:12,796
15.

460
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,464
16.

461
00:45:14,548 --> 00:45:16,675
17.

462
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:29,062
Come on. Santiago.

463
00:45:39,573 --> 00:45:42,201
- Santi. I've been to Mexico once.
- Did you like it?

464
00:45:42,284 --> 00:45:44,578
Gave me the shits for a week.

465
00:45:57,257 --> 00:45:59,259
One day. Son.

466
00:46:00,093 --> 00:46:02,638
But not today. Come on. Move.

467
00:46:06,141 --> 00:46:08,018
Thank you.

468
00:46:08,644 --> 00:46:12,022
- Do you want to sit down. Please?
- OK.

469
00:46:38,298 --> 00:46:42,219
- It may be a little high.
- Why's that?

470
00:46:42,302 --> 00:46:46,306
Well. 'cause you are so close
and you smell nice.

471
00:46:48,809 --> 00:46:51,228
It's normal.

472
00:46:52,855 --> 00:46:57,192
- Are you the club doctor?
- No. I'm his nurse. He'll examine you soon.

473
00:46:57,276 --> 00:47:00,320
- Did you fill in the paperwork?
- Yeah.

474
00:47:00,404 --> 00:47:04,158
Just a couple of words I didn't understand.

475
00:47:05,701 --> 00:47:08,412
OK. Like what?

476
00:47:09,204 --> 00:47:11,832
Like this one here.

477
00:47:12,416 --> 00:47:15,961
That's "cardiovascular".
It means "heart problems".

478
00:47:16,044 --> 00:47:18,130
Oh. No. No.

479
00:47:18,213 --> 00:47:20,048
And how about that one?

480
00:47:20,132 --> 00:47:26,346
"Respiratory" - do you have any problems
with your lungs or breathing?

481
00:47:26,972 --> 00:47:28,974
Do you?

482
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,894
No.

483
00:47:31,977 --> 00:47:34,605
Do you wanna step on the scales?

484
00:47:40,194 --> 00:47:42,321
Right.

485
00:47:43,155 --> 00:47:46,408
- What's your name?
- Nurse Harmison.

486
00:47:46,492 --> 00:47:49,912
- I mean your first name.
- You don't need to know that.

487
00:47:49,995 --> 00:47:52,789
You don't need to know where I live.
What my star sign is.

488
00:47:52,873 --> 00:47:54,917
Or what I'm doing on Saturday night.

489
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:00,839
- I'm gonna have to take blood.
- Oh. Man. Really? I don't like needles.

490
00:48:02,216 --> 00:48:05,427
But you have a tattoo.
Or is that a rub-on transfer?

491
00:48:05,511 --> 00:48:08,514
- That was a gang thing.
- You were in a gang?

492
00:48:11,058 --> 00:48:13,060
Not any more.

493
00:48:15,729 --> 00:48:20,108
There's only three ways to get out
of a gang - you get shot. You go to jail. Or...

494
00:48:20,192 --> 00:48:24,238
In my case. You have a grandmother
who kicks some sense into you.

495
00:48:26,073 --> 00:48:28,534
Sorry. Tough guy.

496
00:48:42,923 --> 00:48:47,219
- What's your problem?
- Problem? What problem?

497
00:48:47,302 --> 00:48:49,555
- Come on.
- Ignore him. He's a tit.

498
00:48:49,638 --> 00:48:52,182
- Walk away.
- He's a knobhead. Laughing at you. Mate.

499
00:48:52,266 --> 00:48:54,643
- He's a knobhead. Mate.
- Hey. Forget him.

500
00:48:54,726 --> 00:48:58,147
- Knobhead? Knobhead?
- Come on. Let's get a game going.

501
00:48:58,605 --> 00:49:00,899
- How long did they give you?
- A month.

502
00:49:00,983 --> 00:49:02,985
A month?

503
00:49:04,194 --> 00:49:07,489
That's not long.
At least I got six.

504
00:49:07,573 --> 00:49:10,325
I was with Tranmere Rovers before this.

505
00:49:10,409 --> 00:49:12,744
They signed me from school
when I was 14.

506
00:49:12,828 --> 00:49:15,831
- How's it going?
- Early days.

507
00:49:19,459 --> 00:49:23,714
That's Gavin Harris.
They just signed him for £8 million.

508
00:49:23,797 --> 00:49:27,759
Dining with the bum-bandit today.
Are we. Jamie?

509
00:49:28,635 --> 00:49:32,848
Hughie Magowan's 33. Unless every other
centre back in the squad breaks his leg.

510
00:49:32,931 --> 00:49:36,310
- He'll not play for the first team again.
- Why be so pissed with me?

511
00:49:36,393 --> 00:49:42,232
Well. You're the new kid on the block. Son.
You've got something he never had - flair.

512
00:49:42,316 --> 00:49:44,485
Flair?

513
00:49:44,568 --> 00:49:47,029
Aye.

514
00:49:47,112 --> 00:49:51,533
You know. Most players. Myself included.
They play within themselves.

515
00:49:51,617 --> 00:49:55,996
They play to their strengths
so they don't expose their weaknesses.

516
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:58,916
The great players. The ones with flair.
They take risks.

517
00:49:58,999 --> 00:50:02,294
Because they don't believe they're risks.
Put your coat down here.

518
00:50:02,377 --> 00:50:04,546
Three and in. You're in.

519
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:06,590
All righty.

520
00:50:07,841 --> 00:50:11,136
They control the ball.
The ball doesn't control them.

521
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:13,222
Here.

522
00:50:15,349 --> 00:50:20,437
Look at this.
Two jackets and a ball. It's all you need.

523
00:50:32,074 --> 00:50:34,159
Finished with that. Son?

524
00:50:36,161 --> 00:50:38,664
Yeah.

525
00:50:39,706 --> 00:50:41,708
Sorry. Sorry.

526
00:50:50,843 --> 00:50:53,178
Santi.

527
00:50:57,307 --> 00:50:59,852
There you go.

528
00:50:59,935 --> 00:51:03,647
Hey. Listen.
I could show you the town if you like.

529
00:51:04,314 --> 00:51:06,900
Tonight. Go clubbing.

530
00:51:06,984 --> 00:51:09,153
Bevvy. Women.

531
00:51:09,236 --> 00:51:12,197
Yeah. Uh...
Do I need an ID or something?

532
00:51:12,739 --> 00:51:15,409
- ID?
- Yeah.

533
00:51:15,492 --> 00:51:17,828
- Identification?
- Yeah.

534
00:51:17,911 --> 00:51:21,165
How old do you have to be here
to get a drink?

535
00:51:21,248 --> 00:51:22,666
Eleven.

536
00:51:38,182 --> 00:51:40,225
All right. Gavin.

537
00:51:40,309 --> 00:51:43,687
Listen. Mate. If you want an autograph.
Write to the club. You muppet.

538
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:47,524
Listen. Elvis. I'm with the club too.
Mate. I'm with the club too. You know.

539
00:51:47,608 --> 00:51:50,152
I've never seen you before.

540
00:51:50,235 --> 00:51:52,654
I don't go out much.

541
00:51:52,738 --> 00:51:56,700
Hey. Hey.
Nurse Harmison. Nurse Harmison.

542
00:51:56,783 --> 00:51:59,912
- Hi.
- You wanna come into this club with us?

543
00:51:59,995 --> 00:52:02,748
No way. It's full of posers. That place.

544
00:52:02,831 --> 00:52:06,126
- Yeah? Where are you going?
- We're going to The Spyglass.

545
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:08,712
- What do you say?
- Yeah. Yeah.

546
00:52:13,008 --> 00:52:15,010
Here we go. Here we go.

547
00:52:19,264 --> 00:52:23,227
Canny wine. This Rioja. It's from
your part of the world. Isn't it? Spain.

548
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:26,438
- No. I'm from LA.
- I'm from Merseyside.

549
00:52:26,522 --> 00:52:30,150
LA? And Merseyside?
What are you two doing up here?

550
00:52:31,235 --> 00:52:34,738
- Well...
- We play for Newcastle.

551
00:52:35,447 --> 00:52:38,075
I thought you said players were off limits.

552
00:52:38,158 --> 00:52:41,078
Relax. They haven't made the reserves yet.

553
00:52:41,995 --> 00:52:46,333
Well. As long as you're mired in mediocrity.
Pet. You're in with a chance.

554
00:52:46,416 --> 00:52:48,544
I'm sorry. But I don't know what that means.

555
00:52:48,627 --> 00:52:52,923
It means don't change.
Don't become something you're not.

556
00:52:53,006 --> 00:52:56,927
Well. My life's already changed.
Just by being here.

557
00:52:57,010 --> 00:53:00,973
I grew up on a council estate with a dad
on the dole and a mum on the booze.

558
00:53:01,056 --> 00:53:03,392
Change is fine with me.

559
00:53:04,351 --> 00:53:06,353
I remember you now.

560
00:53:06,436 --> 00:53:09,022
- You're the one with the toe.
- What?

561
00:53:09,106 --> 00:53:12,359
You had fungus behind your big toenail.

562
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:16,446
- What? Did you have to mention that?
- Oh. Man.

563
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:19,283
I guess in your job.
You must see the whole team naked?

564
00:53:19,366 --> 00:53:24,204
- I know what you're gonna say.
- I'm not gonna ask who has the biggest.

565
00:53:24,288 --> 00:53:28,500
- OK. What were you gonna ask?
- Who has the smallest?

566
00:53:29,418 --> 00:53:31,587
It must be you. Because she cannot tell us.

567
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:34,298
- Go on. Come on.
- Mark him. Mark him.

568
00:53:34,381 --> 00:53:36,800
Space. Hit space.

569
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,512
Stick with him.

570
00:53:43,182 --> 00:53:45,601
- Remember what I told you.
- Here. Here.

571
00:53:45,684 --> 00:53:47,978
OK. Pass. Pass the ball.

572
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,023
Pass it.

573
00:53:53,192 --> 00:53:55,235
Why didn't you pass the ball. Man?

574
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:57,279
Hey. Mal.

575
00:53:58,155 --> 00:54:00,073
Munez.

576
00:54:00,157 --> 00:54:02,117
Come here.

577
00:54:04,995 --> 00:54:09,416
Hey. Lads. Over here.
Come on. Gather round.

578
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:12,211
Hey. Mal. Give me five minutes.

579
00:54:12,294 --> 00:54:14,671
- OK. Boss.
- Thank you.

580
00:54:15,088 --> 00:54:21,178
So when I say go. I want you
to run as fast as you can to the goal.

581
00:54:21,261 --> 00:54:23,222
- OK?
- Yeah.

582
00:54:23,305 --> 00:54:25,265
Go.

583
00:54:28,477 --> 00:54:30,020
Come back.

584
00:54:36,777 --> 00:54:38,904
Again. Go.

585
00:54:49,748 --> 00:54:52,209
What did you learn?

586
00:54:52,292 --> 00:54:55,921
- That you can score from halfway.
- No.

587
00:54:56,004 --> 00:54:59,174
That the ball can travel faster than you.

588
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:03,262
Here. We pass the ball.
You understand that?

589
00:55:03,345 --> 00:55:06,306
We're a unit. Not a one-man show.

590
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:10,143
The name on the front of the shirt is
more important than the one on the back.

591
00:55:10,227 --> 00:55:12,563
- OK?
- Yeah.

592
00:55:15,732 --> 00:55:17,734
- Santi.
- Hey.

593
00:55:36,211 --> 00:55:39,298
This is the final countdown
for Newcastle Utd.

594
00:55:39,381 --> 00:55:43,093
Only three games left this season.
And to qualify for Europe

595
00:55:43,177 --> 00:55:46,180
in the Champions League.
And all the riches that go with that.

596
00:55:46,263 --> 00:55:49,600
They'll have to win them all - starting today.

597
00:55:59,234 --> 00:56:01,236
Oh. Man.

598
00:56:02,613 --> 00:56:04,573
Never an easy team to beat. Chelsea.

599
00:56:04,656 --> 00:56:07,659
- Well-coached. Well-drilled.
- They certainly are.

600
00:56:08,577 --> 00:56:10,579
The game. Yeah.

601
00:56:13,332 --> 00:56:16,210
I'm with Gavin's girlfriend.
I'll call you back.

602
00:56:16,293 --> 00:56:18,295
Lads.

603
00:56:25,802 --> 00:56:28,222
Toon. Toon.
Black and white army.

604
00:56:28,305 --> 00:56:30,933
Toon. Toon. Black and white army.

605
00:56:31,183 --> 00:56:33,769
Toon. Toon. Black and white army.

606
00:57:03,882 --> 00:57:06,552
How's that possible?

607
00:57:27,156 --> 00:57:29,158
For all their possession.
You have to say

608
00:57:29,241 --> 00:57:32,953
Newcastle haven't yet created
one clear-cut chance.

609
00:57:34,913 --> 00:57:36,415
- He's fading.
- Aye.

610
00:57:36,498 --> 00:57:40,210
By a brilliant sense of positional play.
He's avoided contact with the ball.

611
00:57:40,294 --> 00:57:43,839
- Well. Maybe he's playing hurt.
- No. He's hungover.

612
00:57:43,922 --> 00:57:46,383
- Right. Get him off.
- Shola.

613
00:57:53,307 --> 00:57:57,394
Now. This looks quite bad for Newcastle.
The last thing they need is another injury.

614
00:57:57,478 --> 00:58:00,981
They've already got
several walking wounded out there.

615
00:58:01,064 --> 00:58:05,736
Number ten off. Mate.
Free kicks and get far post at corners.

616
00:58:05,819 --> 00:58:09,198
Wait a second.
It's Gavin Harris who's coming off.

617
00:58:09,281 --> 00:58:11,283
What? Me?

618
00:58:12,284 --> 00:58:16,079
He's taking Gavin off.
What the hell is he thinking about?

619
00:58:16,163 --> 00:58:18,957
What are you thinking about.
You German twat?

620
00:58:19,041 --> 00:58:21,919
Substitution for Newcastle United.

621
00:58:25,547 --> 00:58:28,342
- What are you doing?
- Sit down.

622
00:58:31,053 --> 00:58:35,098
Only five minutes left to play.
Still no score.

623
00:58:35,182 --> 00:58:38,393
Chelsea still have the upper hand.

624
00:58:49,905 --> 00:58:53,408
Goal. They've got one at last.

625
00:58:52,324 --> 00:58:54,159
And it's Patrick Kluivert.

626
00:59:16,098 --> 00:59:19,768
- Evening. Mr Dornhelm.
- Good night. Sir.

627
00:59:57,765 --> 00:59:59,433
Yeah.

628
01:00:01,727 --> 01:00:04,188
What are you doing here?
Are you hurt?

629
01:00:04,271 --> 01:00:07,357
- No. No. No. No. I got great news.
- What?

630
01:00:07,441 --> 01:00:09,526
I made the reserve squad.

631
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:12,571
- Oh. That's great.
- I've only one week left on my trial.

632
01:00:12,654 --> 01:00:16,450
This game is make-or-break. If the boss
sees me do well. He'll keep me on.

633
01:00:16,533 --> 01:00:19,495
- I'm sure he will.
- Do you play for Newcastle?

634
01:00:19,578 --> 01:00:22,498
- Yeah.
- Well. Sign your name on that.

635
01:00:24,625 --> 01:00:26,460
OK.

636
01:00:27,544 --> 01:00:30,047
They'll all be asking
for your autograph soon.

637
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:33,383
Will that bother you?
What is your problem with footballers?

638
01:00:33,467 --> 01:00:38,055
I don't have a problem with football.
It's fame I have a problem with.

639
01:00:38,138 --> 01:00:42,267
It's my dad's fault. He was in a rock band
that got hot for five minutes.

640
01:00:42,351 --> 01:00:47,064
- No way. Would I know him?
- I doubt it. I was only three.

641
01:00:47,147 --> 01:00:50,776
Anyway. The point is.
Some of the players remind me of him.

642
01:00:50,859 --> 01:00:53,403
One minute they're nice.
Uncomplicated guys

643
01:00:53,487 --> 01:00:59,410
and the next they're ridiculously rich
arseholes who walk out on their families.

644
01:01:01,328 --> 01:01:03,831
It was my mother who left mine.

645
01:01:05,499 --> 01:01:09,711
- Why? What happened?
- My father never talks about it.

646
01:01:10,295 --> 01:01:14,299
All I remember
is his anger and his drinking.

647
01:01:20,264 --> 01:01:22,433
He's never seen me play.

648
01:01:26,103 --> 01:01:29,690
I love that game. Love football.

649
01:01:29,773 --> 01:01:32,734
Every night after school
and Sundays after church. I'd play.

650
01:01:32,818 --> 01:01:36,029
All I hoped was that one day.
Football could be my whole life.

651
01:01:36,113 --> 01:01:39,992
Why did you have to come so far
to make it happen?

652
01:01:41,076 --> 01:01:44,204
For that. You have to ask the saints.

653
01:01:47,833 --> 01:01:50,085
Why don't you tell him. Grandma?

654
01:01:50,169 --> 01:01:51,128
Tell me what?

655
01:01:53,922 --> 01:01:56,049
Santiago called me.

656
01:01:56,633 --> 01:01:59,261
He sounds very happy.

657
01:01:59,803 --> 01:02:02,848
Tell him about the game.

658
01:02:02,931 --> 01:02:05,350
He's playing tomorrow night

659
01:02:05,434 --> 01:02:07,186
for the reserve team.

660
01:02:08,812 --> 01:02:12,483
After just three weeks.
That's fantastic. No?

661
01:02:12,566 --> 01:02:16,487
He left like a thief.
Without saying goodbye.

662
01:02:16,862 --> 01:02:19,656
Why should I care?

663
01:02:26,914 --> 01:02:30,959
Ey-up. Lads.
Sit down. Pay attention.

664
01:02:32,127 --> 01:02:35,172
Dagger's hamstring is holding up.
So we'll give him a half.

665
01:02:35,255 --> 01:02:38,175
Santiago. I want you on the right flank.

666
01:02:38,258 --> 01:02:40,636
Track the number eight.
He's a slippery bugger.

667
01:02:40,719 --> 01:02:42,971
- I'll translate that for you later.
- Jamie.

668
01:02:43,055 --> 01:02:45,474
I want you to slot in behind the two strikers.

669
01:02:45,557 --> 01:02:48,936
Remember. Don't let 'em
panic you into playing football.

670
01:02:49,019 --> 01:02:51,939
- Howay.
- Right. Come on. Let's go.

671
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:55,984
Let's kick some arse. Fellas.

672
01:02:56,068 --> 01:02:58,570
Come on. Boys.
Let's go. Let's do this.

673
01:03:20,217 --> 01:03:23,178
Reserve Game
Newcastle United V Manchester United

674
01:03:44,283 --> 01:03:46,160
What's that?

675
01:03:50,372 --> 01:03:52,374
What's wrong with him?

676
01:04:01,550 --> 01:04:04,595
Right. Let's have a look.
Let's have you back.

677
01:04:04,678 --> 01:04:08,140
Jackie. How are we?
Santiago. Get back.

678
01:04:25,199 --> 01:04:30,746
Here. Mate. Do you wanna put on
a red shirt? You're having a shocker.

679
01:04:30,829 --> 01:04:32,831
You all right?

680
01:04:35,209 --> 01:04:39,088
- I think that's enough.
- I think you're right.

681
01:04:48,931 --> 01:04:50,599
OK.

682
01:04:52,643 --> 01:04:55,854
Go and get yourself an early bath. Son.

683
01:05:14,123 --> 01:05:16,834
What's the matter?
Are you hurt?

684
01:05:18,001 --> 01:05:20,462
Been out on the town?

685
01:05:23,507 --> 01:05:27,136
Is there something
you want to tell me. Son?

686
01:05:32,141 --> 01:05:33,976
OK.

687
01:05:37,104 --> 01:05:39,106
I don't know. Santi.

688
01:05:39,189 --> 01:05:41,900
I know you've got the skill.

689
01:05:41,984 --> 01:05:47,281
But maybe you don't have the pace
or the stamina for the English game.

690
01:05:47,364 --> 01:05:51,076
Maybe you'd be better off
playing back in LA.

691
01:05:54,663 --> 01:05:57,332
I'm gonna have to let you go. Son.

692
01:06:15,934 --> 01:06:19,146
- Yes?
- Does Roz live here?

693
01:06:20,105 --> 01:06:22,107
Rosie. It's for you.

694
01:06:23,734 --> 01:06:25,736
Oh. God.
Mam. I'm a wreck.

695
01:06:26,945 --> 01:06:30,199
Are you the young man from LA?

696
01:06:30,282 --> 01:06:32,534
Yes. Santiago.

697
01:06:32,618 --> 01:06:34,620
- She'll be down in a minute.
- Thank you.

698
01:06:34,703 --> 01:06:37,039
- Can I get you anything. Pet?
- No. Thank you.

699
01:06:37,122 --> 01:06:40,626
I went there years ago
when my husband's band was on tour.

700
01:06:40,709 --> 01:06:44,588
We stayed at the Hyatt House on Sunset.
Called it the Riot House in those days.

701
01:06:44,671 --> 01:06:48,008
- Aren't you meeting your friends?
- No mad rush.

702
01:06:51,095 --> 01:06:53,430
Nice to meet you. Santiago.

703
01:06:53,514 --> 01:06:55,390
Nice to meet you. Ma'am.

704
01:06:57,726 --> 01:07:00,229
- I love that name.
- Off you go.

705
01:07:08,028 --> 01:07:11,031
- What's wrong?
- I lied to you.

706
01:07:12,449 --> 01:07:14,451
At the physical.

707
01:07:16,703 --> 01:07:20,457
- I have asthma.
- OK. Well. Have you told them?

708
01:07:20,541 --> 01:07:22,793
If I had. They wouldn't have given me a trial.

709
01:07:22,876 --> 01:07:25,379
- So tell them now.
- Too late.

710
01:07:27,214 --> 01:07:30,551
- They fired me.
- Oh. Sant.

711
01:07:31,927 --> 01:07:33,971
I'm so sorry.

712
01:07:37,433 --> 01:07:39,435
I came to say goodbye.

713
01:07:40,269 --> 01:07:42,396
- You're leaving?
- Tomorrow.

714
01:07:42,479 --> 01:07:46,358
- Why so soon?
- I don't belong here if I'm not in the team.

715
01:07:46,442 --> 01:07:48,986
Well. You can find another team.

716
01:07:49,069 --> 01:07:51,530
I guess I was just...

717
01:07:51,613 --> 01:07:55,909
I was just dumb to think
I could make this work.

718
01:07:56,994 --> 01:08:00,414
- Worst thing is I've let people down.
- No.

719
01:08:06,545 --> 01:08:08,714
- Who. Pet?
- Glen.

720
01:08:10,591 --> 01:08:13,385
My grandma. My grandma.

721
01:08:13,469 --> 01:08:16,555
This happens to players all the time.

722
01:08:18,766 --> 01:08:21,769
It's part and parcel of the game.

723
01:08:36,116 --> 01:08:38,118
No. We...

724
01:08:39,953 --> 01:08:42,122
We hardly know each other.

725
01:09:13,612 --> 01:09:14,822
Shit.

726
01:09:48,439 --> 01:09:50,566
- Aren't you...
- No.

727
01:09:50,649 --> 01:09:55,070
I can see why they took you off last week.
You're shite.

728
01:10:09,042 --> 01:10:11,086
Been shagging them Armitage sisters?

729
01:10:11,170 --> 01:10:13,714
Well. You're not the first.

730
01:10:17,134 --> 01:10:22,598
- Paradise Taxis.
- I need one. Urgent. This is Gavin Harris.

731
01:10:22,681 --> 01:10:25,684
And I'm Clint Eastwood. Make my day.

732
01:10:25,768 --> 01:10:30,272
But I'm serious.
This is me. I need a ride. Pronto.

733
01:10:31,815 --> 01:10:35,444
- Are you anywhere near Blakelaw?
- Why?

734
01:10:35,527 --> 01:10:38,864
Gavin Harris is stuck on the estate
and needs a car. Desperate.

735
01:10:38,947 --> 01:10:44,244
- I've already got a fare.
- He's first team. Man. Get there ASAP.

736
01:10:44,328 --> 01:10:48,665
Gotta do a detour. Bonny lad.
Celebrity in peril.

737
01:10:58,133 --> 01:11:00,886
You're that kid from LA?
You going to training as well?

738
01:11:00,969 --> 01:11:04,556
- No. I have to get to the station.
- Why?

739
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:07,309
- I screwed up.
- Tell me about it on the way.

740
01:11:07,392 --> 01:11:10,354
I don't know what
the gaffer will do if I'm late.

741
01:11:18,237 --> 01:11:20,406
So you're Gavin Harris?

742
01:11:21,156 --> 01:11:23,283
- Guilty.
- You're shite.

743
01:11:24,535 --> 01:11:28,205
So I've heard.
Come on. Santi.

744
01:11:28,288 --> 01:11:31,834
With all due respect. Gaffer. Mr Dornhelm.

745
01:11:31,917 --> 01:11:34,962
The club will be making a big mistake
if they let this lad go.

746
01:11:35,045 --> 01:11:37,423
I've played with him.
I've played against him.

747
01:11:37,506 --> 01:11:40,717
I can see he's got it.
So can all of the other lads.

748
01:11:40,801 --> 01:11:44,471
- I mean. Technically...
- What? He's better than you?

749
01:11:47,182 --> 01:11:48,892
Well.

750
01:11:49,893 --> 01:11:52,271
He's in that league.

751
01:11:52,354 --> 01:11:58,026
What happened last night was he lost his
inhaler. He's got asthma. For God's sake.

752
01:11:58,110 --> 01:12:00,529
Is this true?

753
01:12:00,612 --> 01:12:03,282
Yes. Sir. But I tried to hide it.

754
01:12:04,283 --> 01:12:06,910
Lying is a problem.
Asthma is not.

755
01:12:06,994 --> 01:12:09,580
You can get shots.
Medication. Acupuncture.

756
01:12:09,663 --> 01:12:12,750
Didn't your doctor back home
explain this to you?

757
01:12:12,833 --> 01:12:17,129
I don't have a doctor.
All I got is a free clinic in LA.

758
01:12:20,883 --> 01:12:26,805
- People keep pleading your case. Munez.
- All I wanna do is prove them right. Sir.

759
01:12:26,889 --> 01:12:29,349
If you give me the chance.

760
01:12:29,433 --> 01:12:32,478
- You think you deserve it?
- I know I do.

761
01:12:38,609 --> 01:12:40,569
Good.

762
01:12:40,652 --> 01:12:44,073
See the doc.
Tell him about your condition.

763
01:12:44,156 --> 01:12:47,534
Then report for training. All right?

764
01:12:50,871 --> 01:12:53,207
Thank you.

765
01:12:55,042 --> 01:12:56,502
Gavin.

766
01:13:00,047 --> 01:13:02,925
This is a decent thing you did.

767
01:13:03,008 --> 01:13:05,594
Yeah. I do what I can.

768
01:13:08,013 --> 01:13:10,349
Now explain why are you
dressed for discotheque

769
01:13:10,432 --> 01:13:13,143
and 47 minutes late for training?

770
01:13:22,069 --> 01:13:25,864
Reserve Game
Newcastle United V Queens Park Rangers

771
01:13:32,413 --> 01:13:34,248
- Come on.
- You like him?

772
01:13:34,331 --> 01:13:36,333
Yeah.

773
01:13:36,417 --> 01:13:38,877
Go on.

774
01:13:42,506 --> 01:13:46,260
- Stand up. Santi.
- Away you go. Fellas. Away.

775
01:13:46,343 --> 01:13:48,345
Yes. Please.

776
01:13:54,476 --> 01:13:56,687
Yeah.

777
01:14:09,783 --> 01:14:12,077
- Bloody late.
- Got there as quick as I could.

778
01:14:12,161 --> 01:14:14,580
Hughie. Hughie.
Yes. Please. Fella.

779
01:14:14,663 --> 01:14:16,874
No more of that.
That is naughty. OK?

780
01:14:16,957 --> 01:14:19,877
- Away you go.
- He'll think twice about doing you again.

781
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:23,297
- Thought you didn't like me.
- My sister will be upset if you get hurt.

782
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:27,092
She thinks you look like Antonio Banderas.

783
01:14:28,302 --> 01:14:31,597
Hey. If you shag her. I'll kill you.

784
01:14:44,985 --> 01:14:46,904
Reserve Game
Newcastle United V Middlesbrough

785
01:15:12,429 --> 01:15:15,891
- Be careful.
- OK. I can't see a thing.

786
01:15:15,974 --> 01:15:18,936
OK. You're almost there. Little step.

787
01:15:19,019 --> 01:15:21,605
Little step down. Right.

788
01:15:22,606 --> 01:15:25,442
Oh. My God. It's amazing.

789
01:15:27,027 --> 01:15:29,405
- Can you believe this?
- No.

790
01:15:29,488 --> 01:15:32,741
A month ago. I said goodbye to the city.
Goodbye to you.

791
01:15:32,825 --> 01:15:35,035
And now I've got a contract.

792
01:15:35,702 --> 01:15:40,082
- And this little apartment.
- How can you afford it. Though?

793
01:15:42,292 --> 01:15:43,794
Gavino.

794
01:15:43,877 --> 01:15:46,004
Say hello to my friend.

795
01:15:46,088 --> 01:15:47,756
Hello.

796
01:15:50,134 --> 01:15:52,970
I didn't say you could bring women here.

797
01:15:53,053 --> 01:15:55,556
Oh. I'm sorry. Shall I go?

798
01:16:00,769 --> 01:16:04,189
<i>- I'm just kidding. Man. Ciao. Bella.
- How's it going?</i>

799
01:16:04,273 --> 01:16:08,736
Oh. Make yourselves at home.
There's finger stuff in the fridge.

800
01:16:08,819 --> 01:16:12,197
Oh. Takeaway pizzas and ladies knickers?

801
01:16:12,823 --> 01:16:16,493
Not hard to figure out his lifestyle. Is it?

802
01:16:16,577 --> 01:16:19,663
He's all right.
He saved my ass. Remember?

803
01:16:19,747 --> 01:16:26,044
- Got a bit of a rep is what I've heard.
- For professionals. Football is our life.

804
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:35,012
- Good to see you.
- How are you tonight?

805
01:16:36,221 --> 01:16:37,598
Gavin. You all right?

806
01:17:01,622 --> 01:17:04,583
Colin. It's a very good offer.
But just forget about it.

807
01:17:04,666 --> 01:17:07,002
I'll tell you.
'Cause the chairman is a tosser.

808
01:17:07,086 --> 01:17:10,464
The manager knows and says nothing.
Which makes him a bigger tosser.

809
01:17:10,547 --> 01:17:12,549
The players know it.

810
01:17:12,633 --> 01:17:17,304
Yeah. It's all clans and cliques
in the dressing room. Innit. Luv?

811
01:17:17,387 --> 01:17:19,848
- Yeah. Gav.
- Little bit on your nose. Mate.

812
01:17:19,932 --> 01:17:24,228
24-7. mate.
Listen. What's cool and hangs up?

813
01:17:24,311 --> 01:17:26,146
All right. Mate.

814
01:17:26,230 --> 01:17:29,108
- All right. Baz.
- Look at you. Crispy. Mate. How are you?

815
01:17:29,191 --> 01:17:32,194
- Say hello to Santi.
- Heard it's going good. Mate.

816
01:17:32,277 --> 01:17:35,364
Notched a pair for the reserves Saturday.

817
01:17:42,955 --> 01:17:44,623
- Hello.
- Hi. How are you doing?

818
01:17:44,706 --> 01:17:48,460
So. Santi. You got your contract sorted
to the end of the season?

819
01:17:48,544 --> 01:17:53,215
Do you mind if I ask actually
who handled that for you?

820
01:17:53,298 --> 01:17:55,592
- Glen.
- Glen Foy?

821
01:17:55,676 --> 01:17:58,971
- Works in a garage. Bruv.
- Well. It's not actually...

822
01:17:59,054 --> 01:18:03,851
Don't get me wrong. He's a lovely fella.
He used to be an absolute cracking player.

823
01:18:03,934 --> 01:18:08,313
But what does he know
about marketability?

824
01:18:09,189 --> 01:18:11,984
What does he know about endorsements?

825
01:18:12,067 --> 01:18:15,487
You make the first team.
Santi. Next season...

826
01:18:17,239 --> 01:18:19,408
I'll get you a Gap ad.

827
01:18:19,491 --> 01:18:21,660
Crunch.

828
01:18:23,370 --> 01:18:26,331
Hey. Pet. Do you fancy a dance?

829
01:18:26,415 --> 01:18:28,542
Watch out. He's a salsa man.

830
01:18:29,376 --> 01:18:31,336
No. Thank you. Sorry.

831
01:19:06,830 --> 01:19:08,248
Hello.

832
01:19:08,332 --> 01:19:11,794
Santiago? Hey. Bro.
What's going on?

833
01:19:11,877 --> 01:19:13,712
No way.

834
01:19:14,421 --> 01:19:15,881
Papa. It's Santiago.

835
01:19:15,964 --> 01:19:18,008
He wants to talk to you.

836
01:19:20,010 --> 01:19:22,638
Tell him I'm not here.

837
01:19:23,097 --> 01:19:25,099
He can't talk right now. OK?

838
01:19:29,311 --> 01:19:31,855
No problem. Man.

839
01:19:35,776 --> 01:19:37,778
Ey-up. Lads.

840
01:19:38,737 --> 01:19:41,281
Take them up the back pitch. Andy.
Give 'em a stretch.

841
01:19:41,365 --> 01:19:43,492
Kicked me out. Bin-bagged.

842
01:19:43,575 --> 01:19:47,704
- I've got my eye on you. Hughie.
- See you in the showers. Bobby.

843
01:19:50,290 --> 01:19:54,420
- What's up?
- What's up? I just saw the reserve list.

844
01:19:54,503 --> 01:19:57,548
I'm not on the team.
I didn't even make the bench.

845
01:19:57,631 --> 01:19:59,633
I don't get it.

846
01:19:59,716 --> 01:20:02,845
I play where you tell me to play.
I play how you tell me to play.

847
01:20:02,928 --> 01:20:05,556
I didn't drop you. Son.
You're not at my disposal.

848
01:20:05,639 --> 01:20:09,101
- What are you talking about?
- You're playing with that lot.

849
01:20:09,184 --> 01:20:11,728
In London on Saturday.

850
01:20:13,689 --> 01:20:16,024
Santiago.

851
01:20:18,819 --> 01:20:21,822
What are you waiting for?
Come on.

852
01:20:21,905 --> 01:20:24,533
OK. Guys. Let's get to work.

853
01:20:24,616 --> 01:20:26,702
Come on.

854
01:20:56,774 --> 01:20:59,818
Newcastle scraped through
with a win over Chelsea.

855
01:20:59,902 --> 01:21:03,489
But it won't be enough in itself.
Liverpool are breathing down their necks.

856
01:21:03,572 --> 01:21:08,702
And to make it worse. There is a makeshift
look to the Newcastle United line-up today

857
01:21:08,786 --> 01:21:13,373
with all their injury problems. And one
of their substitutes. Santiago Munez.

858
01:21:13,457 --> 01:21:16,293
- Is an unknown quantity.
- He is.

859
01:21:16,376 --> 01:21:18,962
Apparently he was discovered
playing in Los Angeles

860
01:21:19,046 --> 01:21:21,757
by Glen Foy. The ex-Newcastle midfielder.

861
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:25,260
He's been turning some heads
with his performances in the reserves.

862
01:21:25,344 --> 01:21:27,596
But this is a much. Much higher level.

863
01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:33,519
I just wonder how he will cope
if he does get the nod at some point today.

864
01:21:53,914 --> 01:21:56,500
- What have I missed?
- Not a lot.

865
01:21:57,918 --> 01:22:02,131
- How are you feeling?
- I'll feel better if we get three points.

866
01:22:26,572 --> 01:22:31,410
- He's useless. He's useless.
- Howay. Man. Give him a break.

867
01:22:31,493 --> 01:22:35,289
- Get in there.
- Put a challenge in. Man.

868
01:22:43,881 --> 01:22:46,049
Did you see that?

869
01:22:46,967 --> 01:22:48,260
Come on. Ref.

870
01:22:49,261 --> 01:22:51,263
Munez.

871
01:22:55,684 --> 01:22:58,520
Munez. You're going on.

872
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:02,149
A bold move.
But in the circumstances.

873
01:23:02,232 --> 01:23:04,318
I don't think he's got much other choice.

874
01:23:04,401 --> 01:23:07,571
And it is now quite a day
for this young man.

875
01:23:07,654 --> 01:23:10,365
This is a chance to show your worth.
Give me your jacket.

876
01:23:10,449 --> 01:23:13,160
Show them what you've got. Son.

877
01:23:16,455 --> 01:23:17,581
Come on.

878
01:23:17,664 --> 01:23:19,666
Who the hell is this?

879
01:23:21,251 --> 01:23:23,420
That's my son.

880
01:23:24,338 --> 01:23:27,382
That's my boy. Santiago.
I'm his father.

881
01:23:27,466 --> 01:23:31,929
If he scores. Like. I'll buy you a pint.
Come on. Son. Sit at the bar.

882
01:23:32,012 --> 01:23:34,014
Come on.

883
01:23:40,145 --> 01:23:42,731
Substitution for Newcastle United.

884
01:23:42,815 --> 01:23:45,359
Coming off. Number 13. Carl Francis.

885
01:23:45,442 --> 01:23:49,196
Being replaced by number 26.
Santiago Munez.

886
01:23:54,201 --> 01:23:56,203
Go on. Yes.

887
01:24:08,549 --> 01:24:11,051
What a great run by Munez.

888
01:24:11,135 --> 01:24:13,720
Brought down. Penalty.

889
01:24:14,763 --> 01:24:16,640
Come on. Boys.

890
01:24:19,226 --> 01:24:21,103
Penalty. Boys. Penalty.

891
01:24:21,186 --> 01:24:26,650
- Down. You.
- I can't watch it if that playboy's taking it.

892
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:34,032
Just calm it down. All right?

893
01:24:37,369 --> 01:24:39,371
I hate this stuff.

894
01:25:02,436 --> 01:25:05,647
- I'll buy you that pint now. Son.
- It's a little early.

895
01:25:05,731 --> 01:25:09,401
Not in Newcastle. It's not.
Howay. The lads.

896
01:25:10,402 --> 01:25:14,073
Only seconds to go and if it ends like this.

897
01:25:14,156 --> 01:25:18,243
It will be a happy journey back to
the Northeast for the Newcastle players.

898
01:25:26,376 --> 01:25:29,338
- Right. You should lie down. You.
- Aye.

899
01:25:29,421 --> 01:25:31,423
Salsa man.

900
01:25:31,965 --> 01:25:34,093
Munez.

901
01:25:34,176 --> 01:25:38,097
Ah. Beautiful. I know.
Beautiful stuff.

902
01:25:39,348 --> 01:25:41,600
What did you notice
when you won that penalty?

903
01:25:41,683 --> 01:25:45,396
Uh. I noticed... the goal?

904
01:25:45,479 --> 01:25:48,524
You should have noticed two players
in a better position than you.

905
01:25:48,607 --> 01:25:50,901
You don't pass.
You go for glory.

906
01:25:57,241 --> 01:25:59,576
Sven. How are you?

907
01:26:01,161 --> 01:26:05,249
Stop brooding about it. Man.
The gaffer does that to everyone.

908
01:26:05,332 --> 01:26:08,669
You played great.
Everyone saw that. Yeah.

909
01:26:08,752 --> 01:26:10,087
Hey. Hey. Johnny.

910
01:26:10,170 --> 01:26:12,423
- Santiago.
- Hey.

911
01:26:12,506 --> 01:26:14,550
Congratulations. You were amazing.

912
01:26:14,633 --> 01:26:16,718
Oh. Thanks.

913
01:26:16,802 --> 01:26:21,807
My whole family are mad Real Madrid fans.
My grandma. She loves you. Man.

914
01:26:21,890 --> 01:26:26,270
Well. Carry on playing like that.
You'll be there one day.

915
01:26:26,895 --> 01:26:29,898
- See you around.
- Nice to meet you.

916
01:26:32,276 --> 01:26:36,321
- You know how it is. It's your service.
- Gavino. I just...

917
01:26:37,865 --> 01:26:40,492
Hey. Let me introduce you to my mates.
That's Zizou.

918
01:26:40,576 --> 01:26:42,870
This is Raul.
Santiago Munez.

919
01:26:45,539 --> 01:26:47,708
What the hell are you doing with him?

920
01:26:47,791 --> 01:26:49,334
He's the one with the car.

921
01:26:55,215 --> 01:26:57,176
We have to go.

922
01:26:59,887 --> 01:27:03,807
Take care. Yeah.
See you later. All right. Man.

923
01:27:05,267 --> 01:27:10,272
<i>They're over here shooting a commercial.
Mucho dinero. Santi.</i>

924
01:27:10,355 --> 01:27:14,818
- Come on. Let's go. This place is dead.
- What? What do you mean? Where?

925
01:27:14,902 --> 01:27:16,570
This is my town. Son.

926
01:27:20,783 --> 01:27:25,788
Boys. Wicked. We were gonna
send out a search party for you two.

927
01:27:27,539 --> 01:27:30,209
- Nice party. Man.
- This ain't the party.

928
01:27:30,292 --> 01:27:33,462
- Come on. Follow me.
- Upstairs again.

929
01:27:36,965 --> 01:27:38,717
This is the party.

930
01:27:39,468 --> 01:27:41,011
Hello. Boys.

931
01:27:41,095 --> 01:27:44,139
- Fill your boots. Son. It's your birthday.
- Shame on us.

932
01:27:44,223 --> 01:27:46,892
Get in there.

933
01:27:46,975 --> 01:27:49,853
- We're getting this.
- Excuse me.

934
01:27:49,937 --> 01:27:52,356
Come on. Don't be shy.

935
01:27:53,357 --> 01:27:55,692
Ball control. A bit of ball control.

936
01:27:56,485 --> 01:28:00,572
Don't be shy. Your mother wasn't.
That's it. Get in there.

937
01:28:17,047 --> 01:28:21,677
- Not your kind of party?
- I never know what to say.

938
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:26,223
You wouldn't need to say anything
to most of the girls in there.

939
01:28:26,306 --> 01:28:30,018
I have a girl.
Well. I think I have one.

940
01:28:31,061 --> 01:28:33,355
I met someone I really like.

941
01:28:33,439 --> 01:28:35,941
She's very lucky.

942
01:28:39,278 --> 01:28:41,363
How did you and Gavino meet?

943
01:28:41,447 --> 01:28:43,490
Party like this.

944
01:28:43,574 --> 01:28:46,076
Much the same people.

945
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:48,704
Musos. Models. Footballers.

946
01:28:52,166 --> 01:28:55,419
Listen. Don't tell him I've gone.

947
01:28:55,502 --> 01:28:58,005
Not that he'd notice.

948
01:29:04,344 --> 01:29:06,638
Want to explain this?

949
01:29:07,890 --> 01:29:13,020
There's nothing to explain. Sir.
It was just people fooling around at a party.

950
01:29:13,103 --> 01:29:17,274
When you travel with this club.
You're an ambassador for this club.

951
01:29:17,357 --> 01:29:19,401
Mr Dornhelm. It's not my fault.

952
01:29:19,485 --> 01:29:22,738
It is your fault. You exposed yourself
to this kind of situation.

953
01:29:22,821 --> 01:29:24,948
- Who is the other player?
- The other one?

954
01:29:25,032 --> 01:29:28,285
It says there are two Newcastle players.

955
01:29:28,368 --> 01:29:30,454
Who is the other one?

956
01:29:30,537 --> 01:29:34,541
- I cannot tell you that. Sir.
- You mean you won't tell me?

957
01:29:36,543 --> 01:29:38,545
Yeah.

958
01:29:40,339 --> 01:29:43,801
Roz. Roz. Hey.
I have to explain about that picture.

959
01:29:43,884 --> 01:29:45,469
<i>- What picture?
- In The Sun.</i>

960
01:29:45,552 --> 01:29:47,805
- Don't read that rag.
- You haven't seen it?

961
01:29:47,888 --> 01:29:51,308
I showed it to her.
Looked like a good party. That.

962
01:29:51,391 --> 01:29:53,560
Are those lasses' tits real?

963
01:29:54,478 --> 01:29:58,148
- It wasn't how it looked.
- Look. I don't wanna talk about it. OK?

964
01:29:58,232 --> 01:30:02,111
I'm busy. You should go and visit
your friend Jamie while you're here.

965
01:30:02,194 --> 01:30:04,488
He's in examination room B.

966
01:30:10,035 --> 01:30:13,038
- Hey.
- Hey. Santi.

967
01:30:13,122 --> 01:30:17,501
- What happened. Man?
- I got stretchered off in the reserve game.

968
01:30:17,584 --> 01:30:20,587
They've sent me here for an MRI scan.

969
01:30:20,671 --> 01:30:25,092
You'll be fine.
They can fix anything these days. Man.

970
01:30:25,843 --> 01:30:29,638
I don't know.
It felt really bad when it happened.

971
01:30:29,721 --> 01:30:31,890
You could just tell.

972
01:30:34,685 --> 01:30:38,731
I reckon I might have to skip
them salsa lessons.

973
01:30:53,495 --> 01:30:55,831
His meniscus is shattered.

974
01:30:56,623 --> 01:30:59,960
And there's a tear
in the lateral cruciate ligament.

975
01:31:00,043 --> 01:31:02,421
I don't know what that means.

976
01:31:03,088 --> 01:31:05,674
Just tell me. Can he play again?

977
01:31:07,593 --> 01:31:09,928
Not if he wants to walk. No.

978
01:31:19,396 --> 01:31:21,398
- All right. Geezer?
- Hey.

979
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:25,861
Hey. Man. Thanks
for covering for me. Yeah.

980
01:31:25,944 --> 01:31:29,364
You're a top man. If you fingered me.
I was right in the shitter.

981
01:31:29,448 --> 01:31:33,243
We're even. OK?
I don't owe you no more favours.

982
01:31:34,578 --> 01:31:35,913
OK.

983
01:31:35,996 --> 01:31:39,333
You're screwing up your life. Man.
That's how you lost Christina.

984
01:31:39,416 --> 01:31:42,753
- She'll be back.
- No. She won't. You know why?

985
01:31:42,836 --> 01:31:45,923
'Cause she can't stand
your asshole friends.

986
01:31:46,006 --> 01:31:48,675
How do you think that picture
ends up in the paper?

987
01:31:48,759 --> 01:31:51,053
Bluto sold it.

988
01:31:51,136 --> 01:31:56,517
How much does your buddy make dealing
drugs at all the places you get him into?

989
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:58,977
Think I'm some greaseball
who doesn't know stuff?

990
01:31:59,061 --> 01:32:02,189
These are the best years of our lives
and how long have we got?

991
01:32:02,272 --> 01:32:05,234
Ten. If we're lucky?
Or even less. If we get hurt like Jamie.

992
01:32:05,317 --> 01:32:11,281
It can happen to any of us. We're one
tackle away from flipping burgers.

993
01:32:15,619 --> 01:32:17,621
Get out.

994
01:32:19,706 --> 01:32:21,667
Go on. Piss off.

995
01:32:40,686 --> 01:32:42,229
Where's Dad?

996
01:32:42,312 --> 01:32:44,982
He's setting the sprinklers.

997
01:32:55,367 --> 01:32:58,370
Come on. Dad. Let's go.

998
01:32:59,288 --> 01:33:00,664
Dad?

999
01:33:11,008 --> 01:33:12,843
Dad.

1000
01:33:15,053 --> 01:33:18,849
Dad. Wake up. Dad.
Dad. Wake up.

1001
01:33:29,193 --> 01:33:31,236
Hey. Glen.

1002
01:33:31,987 --> 01:33:36,158
Hey. I meant to come over and explain
about that thing in the newspaper.

1003
01:33:36,241 --> 01:33:38,869
Santi. I had a call from LA.

1004
01:33:38,911 --> 01:33:42,247
You need to phone your grandmother.

1005
01:33:59,014 --> 01:34:01,517
- Glen. What's happened?
- His father.

1006
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:03,769
Heart attack. Apparently.

1007
01:34:04,603 --> 01:34:06,897
Is he going to be all right?

1008
01:34:06,980 --> 01:34:09,441
Dead.

1009
01:34:21,370 --> 01:34:23,872
- I've got it.
- No. It's OK. Man.

1010
01:34:24,748 --> 01:34:26,583
Here.

1011
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:29,586
Thanks for everything.

1012
01:34:32,089 --> 01:34:34,091
Safe journey.

1013
01:34:42,224 --> 01:34:46,228
- Yes. Boss.
- There you go. Brilliant. Thank you.

1014
01:34:46,311 --> 01:34:48,272
Hey. Boss.

1015
01:34:50,274 --> 01:34:52,818
- Can I have a word?
- Yes. Please.

1016
01:34:58,073 --> 01:35:01,702
- I was the other bloke in that picture.
- I'm shocked.

1017
01:35:01,785 --> 01:35:05,122
And I thought you should know...

1018
01:35:06,039 --> 01:35:08,876
it was me that dragged Santi
to that party to begin with.

1019
01:35:08,959 --> 01:35:12,880
He didn't even wanna go.
It's not his scene. He's a good lad.

1020
01:35:12,963 --> 01:35:15,382
I take full responsibility.

1021
01:35:17,259 --> 01:35:20,471
Boys with big bank accounts are still boys.

1022
01:35:21,013 --> 01:35:24,183
This is not an excuse for you any more.

1023
01:35:24,266 --> 01:35:27,186
- You're how old?
- 28.

1024
01:35:28,062 --> 01:35:31,815
- 29. I think.
- Yeah. Around that.

1025
01:35:32,900 --> 01:35:36,028
The young players should
be looking to you for an example.

1026
01:35:36,111 --> 01:35:39,281
Off the field as well as on.
Am I right?

1027
01:35:41,283 --> 01:35:43,994
I hear what you're saying. Boss.

1028
01:35:45,662 --> 01:35:47,331
And...

1029
01:35:48,082 --> 01:35:51,126
you're not the first person to say it.

1030
01:36:00,469 --> 01:36:03,889
Flight 19 to London Heathrow
is now boarding.

1031
01:36:03,972 --> 01:36:09,520
All connecting international flights
will be listed on arrival.

1032
01:36:50,310 --> 01:36:52,938
Sir. We're boarding now.

1033
01:36:57,192 --> 01:37:00,779
Keep stretching. Lads.
It'll be a long day.

1034
01:37:05,242 --> 01:37:09,621
What the hell are you doing here?
Why aren't you on the plane?

1035
01:37:09,705 --> 01:37:13,250
I'm sitting in the airport
and I think to myself.

1036
01:37:13,333 --> 01:37:15,544
At least now I have an excuse.

1037
01:37:15,627 --> 01:37:19,673
A reason to give my buddies and
everybody else why things didn't work out.

1038
01:37:19,757 --> 01:37:24,803
"Hey. My dad died. I had to come home.
Take care of business."

1039
01:37:26,346 --> 01:37:30,142
- Know why I needed an excuse?
- No.

1040
01:37:30,225 --> 01:37:33,270
Because that's the way
my father made me think.

1041
01:37:33,353 --> 01:37:35,397
He took away my self-belief.

1042
01:37:35,481 --> 01:37:39,902
<i>He made it impossible
to have... aspiracion.</i>

1043
01:37:39,985 --> 01:37:43,072
- Aspiration. You understand?
- Yes.

1044
01:37:43,155 --> 01:37:45,324
I don't need an excuse.

1045
01:37:46,366 --> 01:37:50,162
The only person who can tell me
I'm not good enough is you.

1046
01:37:54,333 --> 01:37:56,335
And even then...

1047
01:37:58,796 --> 01:38:01,423
I may not agree with you.

1048
01:38:10,015 --> 01:38:12,017
You are right. Santi.

1049
01:38:13,185 --> 01:38:15,813
There's no point in coming back.

1050
01:38:16,730 --> 01:38:18,732
It's God's will.

1051
01:38:30,619 --> 01:38:32,496
Hey.

1052
01:38:32,579 --> 01:38:33,872
Hi.

1053
01:38:38,752 --> 01:38:41,422
So how are you feeling?

1054
01:38:44,425 --> 01:38:46,718
I never made peace with my dad.

1055
01:38:46,802 --> 01:38:50,389
- He never made peace with you either.
- No. But he never forgave me.

1056
01:38:50,472 --> 01:38:52,474
You don't know that.

1057
01:38:53,308 --> 01:38:55,769
How can you know that?

1058
01:38:55,853 --> 01:38:59,523
What about all those pictures
you sent home?

1059
01:39:00,983 --> 01:39:03,986
I don't know where home is any more.

1060
01:39:04,069 --> 01:39:06,155
Yeah. You do.

1061
01:39:06,238 --> 01:39:10,451
It's green
and it's got a goalpost at each end.

1062
01:39:43,317 --> 01:39:45,319
Munez.

1063
01:39:59,958 --> 01:40:01,960
How are you doing?

1064
01:40:03,545 --> 01:40:06,048
OK. Boss.

1065
01:40:06,131 --> 01:40:10,427
Tough thing to lose a father.
I remember when I lost mine.

1066
01:40:11,512 --> 01:40:12,971
Thank you.

1067
01:40:15,557 --> 01:40:20,187
You shouldn't be here.
The groundsman is having a fit.

1068
01:40:20,270 --> 01:40:22,272
His turf is sacred.

1069
01:40:23,482 --> 01:40:25,150
I just...

1070
01:40:26,151 --> 01:40:28,654
I just wanted to see what it felt like.

1071
01:40:28,737 --> 01:40:31,073
You know...

1072
01:40:31,156 --> 01:40:33,325
to be on this pitch.

1073
01:40:34,576 --> 01:40:37,413
You'll find out Saturday.

1074
01:40:37,496 --> 01:40:39,665
Now get off the grass.

1075
01:40:51,343 --> 01:40:53,011
Yeah.

1076
01:40:59,476 --> 01:41:02,813
I'm in the squad for the Liverpool game.

1077
01:41:04,606 --> 01:41:06,567
- Get us a ticket. Then. Will you?
- Yeah.

1078
01:41:06,650 --> 01:41:09,236
Well done. Son. Well done.

1079
01:41:09,319 --> 01:41:13,699
Well. I never doubted it. Son. First time
I saw you. I said to Phil. Didn't I. Phil?

1080
01:41:13,782 --> 01:41:16,160
- That lad's got it.
- No. You didn't.

1081
01:41:17,953 --> 01:41:20,330
I owe you. Man.
Breakfast. Remember?

1082
01:41:20,414 --> 01:41:22,249
Here.

1083
01:41:22,332 --> 01:41:24,334
Get in. We're celebrating.

1084
01:41:24,418 --> 01:41:26,837
- Is that Gavin Harris?
- Where?

1085
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:32,259
<i>We're meeting a couple of girls at a club
and then back to my gaff. La vida loca.</i>

1086
01:41:33,051 --> 01:41:36,096
I'm joking. Blockbuster and pizza.

1087
01:41:38,307 --> 01:41:40,309
Can we put the top up?
My ass is freezing.

1088
01:41:40,392 --> 01:41:42,394
Buy a coat.

1089
01:42:11,006 --> 01:42:15,886
It's down to this. The last game.
Against their main rivals. Liverpool.

1090
01:42:15,969 --> 01:42:19,348
The next 90 minutes
will decide Newcastle's fate.

1091
01:42:19,431 --> 01:42:22,768
Will it be Europe. And all the glory
that goes with it. Next season?

1092
01:42:22,851 --> 01:42:25,604
If so. They have to win today.

1093
01:42:29,233 --> 01:42:31,860
Private box?

1094
01:42:31,944 --> 01:42:34,238
I'd check your ticket.

1095
01:42:34,321 --> 01:42:36,490
So. Glen. Are you single then?

1096
01:42:48,127 --> 01:42:50,546
OK. Listen up.

1097
01:42:50,629 --> 01:42:52,631
Guys.

1098
01:43:00,556 --> 01:43:02,891
You know what you have to do.

1099
01:43:40,596 --> 01:43:43,182
Sant's come on. Sant's come on.

1100
01:43:57,529 --> 01:44:01,116
Now. Newcastle are choosing
to start with young Santiago Munez.

1101
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:04,286
It's only his second-ever appearance
for the senior side.

1102
01:44:04,369 --> 01:44:06,997
I guess they'll be hoping
he produces some of the flair

1103
01:44:07,039 --> 01:44:09,625
that he showed
as a substitute at Fulham last week.

1104
01:44:20,803 --> 01:44:23,222
Our ball.

1105
01:44:23,305 --> 01:44:24,973
Yes.

1106
01:44:25,933 --> 01:44:28,435
- Come on. Sant. Come on. Sant.
- Go. Santiago.

1107
01:44:34,316 --> 01:44:36,527
It is getting physical now.

1108
01:44:36,610 --> 01:44:42,074
You can feel the determination.
Both teams really need this win.

1109
01:44:42,908 --> 01:44:45,202
I've got an airport pickup for you.

1110
01:44:45,285 --> 01:44:50,207
Cannae. Tommy. I'm rushed off me feet.
I'll get back to you.

1111
01:44:53,627 --> 01:44:57,214
Excuse me. Lads.
Room for a little 'un.

1112
01:44:57,297 --> 01:44:59,925
- How's it going?
- We've made all the early running.

1113
01:45:00,008 --> 01:45:02,219
- How long's it been on?
- A minute.

1114
01:45:07,224 --> 01:45:09,476
Given away by Liverpool.

1115
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:14,565
Alan Shearer looking to organize
a counterattack for Newcastle United.

1116
01:45:15,649 --> 01:45:19,278
He's got support to his right.
Stephen Carr.

1117
01:45:20,863 --> 01:45:23,031
Now Dyer taking over.

1118
01:45:23,115 --> 01:45:26,660
Harris is getting into the middle.
Here comes Harris.

1119
01:45:29,329 --> 01:45:31,331
And a goal. It's Harris.

1120
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:35,210
It's a dream start for Newcastle.

1121
01:45:36,128 --> 01:45:39,590
And what a way to answer his critics.

1122
01:45:44,094 --> 01:45:46,096
Come on.

1123
01:45:46,930 --> 01:45:49,308
Number ten. Gavin Harris.

1124
01:45:55,773 --> 01:45:57,983
Referee has given the foul.

1125
01:45:59,693 --> 01:46:02,362
Free kick to Liverpool.

1126
01:46:02,780 --> 01:46:05,449
And they've taken it quickly.

1127
01:46:09,620 --> 01:46:11,705
It's a corner.

1128
01:46:13,791 --> 01:46:15,793
Free header.

1129
01:46:17,586 --> 01:46:20,339
Liverpool are level. 1-1.

1130
01:46:20,422 --> 01:46:25,427
Goal-scorer for Liverpool.
Number 25. Igor Biscan.

1131
01:46:32,142 --> 01:46:36,230
Newcastle have given
the ball away yet again.

1132
01:46:39,983 --> 01:46:43,404
Into Baroð.
He's got a chance to shoot here.

1133
01:46:44,113 --> 01:46:47,241
Oh. It's in.
Liverpool lead. 2-1.

1134
01:46:54,665 --> 01:46:58,001
They've conceded two goals
in quick succession without reply.

1135
01:46:58,085 --> 01:47:00,379
That's a devastating blow for Newcastle.

1136
01:47:00,462 --> 01:47:02,840
Now. Can they come back from it?

1137
01:47:05,426 --> 01:47:09,555
Goal-scorer for Liverpool.
Number five. Milan Baroð.

1138
01:47:09,638 --> 01:47:14,518
Here we go. Second half.
With Liverpool firmly in the driving seat.

1139
01:47:14,601 --> 01:47:20,357
And that second goal has really
knocked the stuffing out of the fans.

1140
01:47:24,069 --> 01:47:26,405
Oh. It's a great chance
for Gerrard...

1141
01:47:26,488 --> 01:47:28,741
Oh. So close.

1142
01:47:28,824 --> 01:47:33,537
Had that gone in. It would have been
"Good night. Newcastle."

1143
01:47:39,918 --> 01:47:43,756
Now it's Munez.
The youngster's got some great skill.

1144
01:47:43,839 --> 01:47:47,092
Trying a give-and-go here
with Alan Shearer.

1145
01:47:49,762 --> 01:47:51,847
Give it.

1146
01:47:51,930 --> 01:47:53,140
Pass.

1147
01:47:53,223 --> 01:47:55,142
Give it.

1148
01:47:57,061 --> 01:47:59,438
- Yes.
- Come on. Pass.

1149
01:48:02,649 --> 01:48:04,151
Pass.

1150
01:48:07,863 --> 01:48:10,783
It's a goal. It is 2-2.

1151
01:48:11,784 --> 01:48:13,994
You beauty.

1152
01:48:26,173 --> 01:48:29,802
- We should have a talk about your lad.
- Talk about what. Barry?

1153
01:48:29,885 --> 01:48:33,222
Representation. It's gonna be
a feeding frenzy. Gonna be murders.

1154
01:48:33,305 --> 01:48:37,267
- A lot of sharks out there.
- I know. That's why he signed with me.

1155
01:48:37,351 --> 01:48:38,936
You what?

1156
01:48:39,478 --> 01:48:41,605
Great effort by Newcastle.

1157
01:48:41,688 --> 01:48:48,362
But remember. If it stays like this. It will still
be Liverpool in Europe next season.

1158
01:48:49,571 --> 01:48:53,409
Only three minutes to go now
and Newcastle are running out of time.

1159
01:48:53,492 --> 01:48:58,122
They've got to try
and find a winner from somewhere.

1160
01:48:58,205 --> 01:48:59,623
Back. Come on.

1161
01:49:05,170 --> 01:49:06,922
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1162
01:49:10,676 --> 01:49:13,178
Go on. Son. Have a poke.

1163
01:49:13,971 --> 01:49:15,472
Let go.

1164
01:49:20,561 --> 01:49:23,397
Free kick here.
In a very dangerous area.

1165
01:49:23,480 --> 01:49:25,733
- Get him off.
- Took him down. Give him a card.

1166
01:49:25,816 --> 01:49:30,988
A real chance for Newcastle. This.
But who's going to take it?

1167
01:49:33,031 --> 01:49:35,200
Hey. Santi.

1168
01:49:37,161 --> 01:49:38,245
It's yours.

1169
01:49:38,328 --> 01:49:42,875
I hope they know what they're doing.
It's young Santiago Munez stepping up.

1170
01:49:42,958 --> 01:49:45,669
With only seconds left to play.

1171
01:49:45,753 --> 01:49:52,134
And he must feel that the hopes of
an entire city are resting on his shoulders.

1172
01:50:00,726 --> 01:50:02,853
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1173
01:50:39,181 --> 01:50:42,518
- And I thought you didn't even like football.
- I know.

1174
01:50:42,601 --> 01:50:47,314
Unbelievable.
Newcastle's newest and youngest player

1175
01:50:47,398 --> 01:50:50,567
gives the fans a brand-new song to sing.

1176
01:50:50,651 --> 01:50:55,322
<i>Santiago. Santiago. Ole. Ole. Ole.</i>

1177
01:50:59,118 --> 01:51:02,204
That's my grandson. His brother.

1178
01:51:02,287 --> 01:51:05,207
- It's true. And he's from here.
- We met his dad.

1179
01:51:05,290 --> 01:51:06,875
How could you?

1180
01:51:06,959 --> 01:51:10,838
He was here for the Fulham game. Me
darlin'. He was over the moon. Wasn't he?

1181
01:51:10,921 --> 01:51:12,923
Dad was here?

1182
01:51:16,677 --> 01:51:21,223
Only seconds to go.
Time almost up.

1183
01:51:46,457 --> 01:51:48,125
Santi.

1184
01:51:48,208 --> 01:51:51,545
Santi. Someone wants to speak to you.

1185
01:51:53,589 --> 01:51:54,590
Yeah?

1186
01:51:54,673 --> 01:51:58,927
Santiago. Santiago. We saw the game.

1187
01:51:59,011 --> 01:52:01,305
Julio and me.

1188
01:52:01,388 --> 01:52:06,060
No. Glen's daughter brought us.
You were fantastic.

1189
01:52:06,643 --> 01:52:10,647
<i>Si. And I wanna tell you something else.
About your father.</i>

1190
01:52:13,150 --> 01:52:15,694
Hey. Glen.

1191
01:52:16,779 --> 01:52:20,657
You know when I played against Fulham?

1192
01:52:20,741 --> 01:52:22,743
My dad saw the game.

1193
01:52:24,203 --> 01:52:26,580
He saw me play. Man.

1194
01:52:27,289 --> 01:52:30,125
He's probably watching you right now.

1195
01:52:34,546 --> 01:52:36,757
Santi.

1196
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:38,550
Santi.

1197
01:52:38,634 --> 01:52:40,636
Santiago.

1198
01:52:48,102 --> 01:52:50,104
Yeah.
