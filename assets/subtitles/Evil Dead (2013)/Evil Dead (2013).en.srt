1
00:02:09,923 --> 00:02:11,842
We caught the bitch.

2
00:02:27,608 --> 00:02:29,860
Please, don't hurt me.

3
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,029
Don't be afraid, girl.

4
00:02:34,448 --> 00:02:35,908
Who are you?

5
00:02:41,663 --> 00:02:43,248
Somebody please help me!

6
00:02:43,248 --> 00:02:49,630
Only the evil book can undo
what the evil book has done.

7
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,132
Please...
I just want to go home.

8
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:57,554
Please. I just want to go home.

9
00:03:06,647 --> 00:03:07,481
Daddy?

10
00:03:10,526 --> 00:03:13,320
Daddy, what are you doing to me?

11
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,573
- Who are these people?
- They're good people.

12
00:03:16,573 --> 00:03:18,784
They're here to help.

13
00:03:18,784 --> 00:03:23,622
What are you talking about?
Where's Mom?

14
00:03:23,622 --> 00:03:27,084
Mommy's dead, baby.
You know that.

15
00:03:32,047 --> 00:03:35,676
You killed her. You did.

16
00:03:35,676 --> 00:03:41,181
No. Why are you saying these things?
Daddy, Please, I just want to go home.

17
00:03:41,181 --> 00:03:42,474
I just want to go home.

18
00:03:42,474 --> 00:03:46,061
Do it!
It's the only way to save her soul!

19
00:03:48,272 --> 00:03:50,399
I'm so sorry, baby.

20
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:54,361
Daddy, what is that?
No!

21
00:03:59,074 --> 00:04:03,620
Daddy.
Daddy, look. It's me. It's me.

22
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,915
Do it! Give your daughter peace!

23
00:04:06,915 --> 00:04:10,544
I just want you to hold me
and take me home.

24
00:04:10,544 --> 00:04:11,545
Please!

25
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:19,052
Please, stop.

26
00:04:20,929 --> 00:04:24,516
I will rip your soul out, Daddy.

27
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:29,980
I'll rip your soul out,
you pathetic fuck!

28
00:04:31,815 --> 00:04:38,947
You motherfucker! I will kill you,
like I killed your whore!

29
00:04:44,036 --> 00:04:45,329
Fuck!

30
00:04:45,329 --> 00:04:48,040
Fuck!...

31
00:04:56,381 --> 00:04:59,009
I love you, baby.

32
00:05:02,763 --> 00:05:08,894
EVIL DEAD

33
00:06:27,014 --> 00:06:28,223
Hey.

34
00:06:28,223 --> 00:06:30,517
How's it going?
Mr. Hot shit city boy.

35
00:06:30,517 --> 00:06:32,186
- Hey, Olivia.
- Come here.

36
00:06:32,644 --> 00:06:34,938
Two arms, please.
Like you missed me.

37
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:39,067
This is my girl, Natalie.

38
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:41,236
Oh, the heartbreaker from the carshop.

39
00:06:41,236 --> 00:06:43,113
The doctor?

40
00:06:43,113 --> 00:06:45,824
- Actually, she's...
- I'm a registered nurse.

41
00:06:45,824 --> 00:06:49,119
Nurse? Right, sorry.

42
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:51,413
You were supposed to be here
two hours ago, man.

43
00:06:51,413 --> 00:06:53,665
And that's our
irresistibly charming, Eric.

44
00:06:53,665 --> 00:06:56,335
So teaching in high school finally
turned you into a bitter old coot, huh?

45
00:06:56,335 --> 00:06:58,545
No, you did.

46
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:01,632
Kept us waiting here all morning.

47
00:07:01,632 --> 00:07:03,926
Good to see you too, man.
Come here.

48
00:07:05,844 --> 00:07:07,346
You look good.

49
00:07:08,263 --> 00:07:10,265
She's waiting for you at the back.

50
00:07:11,642 --> 00:07:12,476
Great.

51
00:07:27,282 --> 00:07:28,909
Hey, Mia.

52
00:07:30,202 --> 00:07:31,954
I'll be damned.

53
00:07:33,288 --> 00:07:34,998
You actually came.

54
00:07:34,998 --> 00:07:38,335
Come on, I'm your big brother.
Of course I came.

55
00:07:39,294 --> 00:07:41,588
I know I look like roadkill.

56
00:07:41,588 --> 00:07:44,007
No, you look beautiful
as always.

57
00:07:44,007 --> 00:07:46,510
And you're a charming liar.

58
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,428
As always.

59
00:07:50,222 --> 00:07:51,598
Grandpa!

60
00:07:52,558 --> 00:07:56,895
Hey!
Hey there, buddy!

61
00:07:58,147 --> 00:08:00,315
We always loved this place,
didn't we?

62
00:08:01,316 --> 00:08:03,360
He missed you a lot, you know.

63
00:08:06,822 --> 00:08:08,699
- Oh my God.
- What?

64
00:08:09,658 --> 00:08:11,326
- What is that?
- What?

65
00:08:11,326 --> 00:08:12,786
Just this, right here.
What...

66
00:08:14,997 --> 00:08:17,166
It's not funny!

67
00:08:18,584 --> 00:08:21,253
This is...
It's made from a buckthorn tree.

68
00:08:21,253 --> 00:08:23,088
It's supposed
to make your will stronger.

69
00:08:23,088 --> 00:08:25,257
But I thought you didn't believe
in that kind of stuff.

70
00:08:25,257 --> 00:08:29,219
I don't. But you do,
so maybe it will work.

71
00:08:31,138 --> 00:08:31,805
Okay.

72
00:08:33,223 --> 00:08:35,142
Well, then, let's do this.

73
00:08:41,523 --> 00:08:43,901
Promise me you'll stay with me
until the end.

74
00:08:43,901 --> 00:08:46,278
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Cross your heart.

75
00:08:47,654 --> 00:08:48,322
Okay.

76
00:08:50,115 --> 00:08:51,450
Hope to die.

77
00:08:55,329 --> 00:08:56,663
Okay.

78
00:08:56,663 --> 00:09:01,376
May my friends and family,
witness this act.

79
00:09:01,376 --> 00:09:06,340
an irrevocable promise
to my commitment, that...

80
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,053
Fuck it.

81
00:09:14,932 --> 00:09:21,772
I promise not to touch this shit
ever again.

82
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,569
Okay.

83
00:09:29,112 --> 00:09:30,656
Let's play cold turkey.

84
00:09:37,663 --> 00:09:39,331
Hopefully, it still works.

85
00:09:44,128 --> 00:09:44,628
Wait...

86
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:00,310
Looks like someone broke in.

87
00:10:01,979 --> 00:10:03,188
Be careful.

88
00:10:14,199 --> 00:10:16,410
What's that smell?

89
00:10:18,036 --> 00:10:19,621
Some teenagers probably
just broke in here,

90
00:10:19,621 --> 00:10:21,748
to drink beer,
and bump uglies.

91
00:10:21,748 --> 00:10:22,875
Exactly.

92
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:28,088
Mom would've hated
seeing the cabin like this.

93
00:10:28,088 --> 00:10:28,797
Okay.

94
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,925
Let's make this place livable.

95
00:11:09,087 --> 00:11:09,922
Hey.

96
00:11:12,591 --> 00:11:14,426
Are you okay?

97
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,971
Do you remember that lullaby
Mommy used to sing to us?

98
00:11:19,014 --> 00:11:21,975
It was something like...

99
00:11:21,975 --> 00:11:26,522
"Baby, you little baby,
it's time to say goodbye."

100
00:11:29,274 --> 00:11:30,692
- "Baby, little baby".
- Mia please...

101
00:11:30,692 --> 00:11:33,570
I don't think you need sad
memories in your head right now.

102
00:11:34,822 --> 00:11:36,824
Mom is not a sad one.

103
00:11:36,824 --> 00:11:38,450
You know what I mean.

104
00:11:42,162 --> 00:11:45,082
You know, during her final days
at the hospital,

105
00:11:45,082 --> 00:11:49,044
Mom sometimes thought
I was you.

106
00:11:50,671 --> 00:11:53,382
She even called me David
for a whole day, once.

107
00:11:53,382 --> 00:11:57,136
And, I played along.
Because...

108
00:11:57,136 --> 00:12:00,889
Mia, look. I wanted to be there.
Okay, I did.

109
00:12:01,723 --> 00:12:02,975
But by the time Mom got bad,

110
00:12:02,975 --> 00:12:05,561
I had just gotten the job
at the garage in Chicago,

111
00:12:07,312 --> 00:12:10,357
I don't know, I had a hard time
finding the right moment to come back.

112
00:12:12,359 --> 00:12:14,570
And then, it was too late,
so...

113
00:12:18,031 --> 00:12:22,286
Maybe you were lucky,
not to see her the way that I did.

114
00:12:55,986 --> 00:12:57,571
Looks like she's doing okay.

115
00:12:59,114 --> 00:13:01,158
David, there's something
you need to know.

116
00:13:04,036 --> 00:13:04,828
Okay.

117
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,665
We already tried this whole thing
back in Flint last summer.

118
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:12,461
Mia made the same promises,

119
00:13:12,461 --> 00:13:16,340
She took the same
dramatic vow of sobriety,

120
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,300
before chucking her dope
down in the toilet.

121
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,552
She lasted eight hours and quit.

122
00:13:23,013 --> 00:13:26,016
So, we don't like to give her
that chance this time.

123
00:13:26,016 --> 00:13:27,601
What do you mean?

124
00:13:28,811 --> 00:13:31,104
David, when she breaks,

125
00:13:31,104 --> 00:13:32,898
and believe me,
she will,

126
00:13:34,441 --> 00:13:36,318
we don't want to let her leave.

127
00:13:39,863 --> 00:13:42,449
What do you mean?
You want to force her to stay here?

128
00:13:42,449 --> 00:13:43,283
Mia?

129
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,496
This time, the only way,
is the hard way, man.

130
00:13:47,496 --> 00:13:51,458
- She won't survive another O.D.
- What?

131
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,710
Mia O.D'd?

132
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,546
She didn't just O.D.

133
00:13:55,546 --> 00:13:58,215
Legally, your sister died.

134
00:13:58,215 --> 00:14:00,300
They had to defibrillate her.

135
00:14:04,179 --> 00:14:05,472
Oh, Jesus.

136
00:14:07,808 --> 00:14:10,644
Look, we all need to be together on this,
otherwise it won't work.

137
00:14:11,562 --> 00:14:12,855
Good boy.

138
00:14:13,814 --> 00:14:16,650
I came here to make things
better with my sister, not worse.

139
00:14:19,695 --> 00:14:21,780
If she asks me to take her home
at some point,

140
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,074
I'm gonna have to do it.

141
00:14:25,117 --> 00:14:28,120
I can't stand it!
I can't stand it! Fuck!

142
00:14:29,246 --> 00:14:31,665
Oh! I can't stand it!

143
00:14:31,665 --> 00:14:33,876
I don't know what even that smell!

144
00:14:33,876 --> 00:14:35,043
I know. It's Ok.

145
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,547
It's OK, it's OK.

146
00:14:38,547 --> 00:14:41,675
I can't stand
that fucking smell anymore!

147
00:14:41,675 --> 00:14:43,886
Calm down, okay?

148
00:14:43,886 --> 00:14:46,305
We're right here.
I know, I know.

149
00:14:48,682 --> 00:14:51,101
We're all here.

150
00:14:52,728 --> 00:14:54,563
We're not going anywhere.

151
00:15:02,571 --> 00:15:04,990
Withdrawal is kicking in hard enough.

152
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,742
This should be get you
through the night.

153
00:15:07,993 --> 00:15:10,579
I don't know
what is wrong with you people,

154
00:15:10,579 --> 00:15:14,500
but there's something dead
and it reeks.

155
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,543
But there's no smell.

156
00:15:16,543 --> 00:15:18,378
You're just extra sensitive right now.

157
00:15:18,378 --> 00:15:21,381
I just can't stand
that fucking smell anymore!

158
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:25,093
Wait.

159
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,397
Whoa... Is that blood?

160
00:15:52,913 --> 00:15:54,164
Oh, shit.

161
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,128
What's your medical diagnosis now?

162
00:15:59,128 --> 00:16:01,380
It fucking stinks.

163
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:04,424
Oh, shit. Careful.

164
00:16:04,424 --> 00:16:06,677
These steps are old and rotten
down here.

165
00:16:06,677 --> 00:16:09,429
- Yeah, like this whole freaking house.
- I know.

166
00:16:19,481 --> 00:16:21,441
Smells like burned hair.

167
00:16:22,943 --> 00:16:24,695
I think it's back there.

168
00:16:38,584 --> 00:16:39,585
Oh, shit.

169
00:16:46,967 --> 00:16:50,387
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, shit!

170
00:16:55,934 --> 00:16:58,979
- What is this?
- I don't know.

171
00:16:58,979 --> 00:17:00,439
Witchcraft?

172
00:17:01,356 --> 00:17:02,566
Who will do this?

173
00:17:07,488 --> 00:17:09,114
Shit, something burned here.

174
00:17:12,242 --> 00:17:12,993
Look.

175
00:17:18,123 --> 00:17:19,374
Shit, man.

176
00:17:19,374 --> 00:17:21,335
What the fuck happened here?

177
00:17:22,294 --> 00:17:25,214
Let's not go crazy over this, okay?

178
00:17:25,214 --> 00:17:26,882
I'll bury those stink cats
out back later.

179
00:17:26,882 --> 00:17:29,551
Yeah, the smell will be gone
in no time.

180
00:17:29,551 --> 00:17:31,053
Yeah, okay.

181
00:17:32,262 --> 00:17:35,057
And what about the voodoo shit
they did down there, huh?

182
00:17:35,057 --> 00:17:38,769
No, no, no.voodoo is more about
dolls, personal artifacts.

183
00:17:38,769 --> 00:17:41,271
- This something different.
- Eric, that's enough.

184
00:17:43,816 --> 00:17:46,360
You shouldn't have touched
anything from that basement.

185
00:19:51,819 --> 00:19:54,863
"Naturom Demonto".

186
00:20:42,536 --> 00:20:43,620
"Kunda"...

187
00:20:50,836 --> 00:20:52,671
"Astratta"...

188
00:20:57,342 --> 00:20:59,178
"Montosse"...

189
00:21:05,476 --> 00:21:06,685
"Can'da".

190
00:21:18,906 --> 00:21:22,534
Please God,
give me a break.

191
00:21:29,792 --> 00:21:32,211
Mia.

192
00:21:42,846 --> 00:21:44,139
What are you doing?

193
00:21:44,139 --> 00:21:47,017
I'm sorry but I have to get out
of here right now.

194
00:21:47,768 --> 00:21:49,603
No, come on.
Slumber party isn't over yet.

195
00:21:49,603 --> 00:21:51,855
Yeah, who will start and play
"Fuck, Marry, Kill." Right?

196
00:21:51,855 --> 00:21:55,442
- Mia, please. Look, Mia...
- I'm going insane here.

197
00:21:55,442 --> 00:21:59,029
Olivia, I feel
like I'm loosing my mind.

198
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,573
Mia, what is it?

199
00:22:04,076 --> 00:22:06,203
I will go through with this, okay?

200
00:22:06,745 --> 00:22:08,914
I just...
I can't do it here.

201
00:22:08,914 --> 00:22:09,998
Mia...

202
00:22:11,834 --> 00:22:14,002
We've decided
we're not gonna take you back.

203
00:22:17,464 --> 00:22:19,383
We can't loose you again.

204
00:22:19,967 --> 00:22:22,177
You're gonna have
to stick it out this time.

205
00:22:25,264 --> 00:22:27,141
David, drive me home.

206
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:32,980
Come on, David.

207
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,606
Mia...

208
00:22:34,606 --> 00:22:36,108
Mia, maybe they're right.

209
00:22:39,945 --> 00:22:43,824
You're supposed to be here
to support me, not them.

210
00:22:43,824 --> 00:22:44,575
I'm here for you, Mia...

211
00:22:44,575 --> 00:22:46,285
- that's why I came.
- Oh my God.

212
00:22:46,285 --> 00:22:48,537
I'm such an idiot...

213
00:22:48,537 --> 00:22:51,832
to think for once in my life,

214
00:22:51,832 --> 00:22:53,542
I could count on you.

215
00:22:56,879 --> 00:22:58,464
Mia, we're all just trying
to help you!

216
00:22:58,464 --> 00:23:00,549
Yea, well, fuck you very much!

217
00:23:07,556 --> 00:23:09,475
Eric, leave her alone.

218
00:23:09,892 --> 00:23:10,642
Mia.

219
00:23:24,031 --> 00:23:24,865
Mia!

220
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,703
Perfect.

221
00:23:30,913 --> 00:23:36,627
Fuck this! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
Fuck! Fuck!

222
00:23:38,212 --> 00:23:42,257
What the fuck am I doing?
What the fuck am I doing?

223
00:25:25,194 --> 00:25:26,028
Mia!

224
00:25:30,157 --> 00:25:30,991
Mia!

225
00:25:40,751 --> 00:25:41,502
Mia.

226
00:25:47,257 --> 00:25:48,008
Mia.

227
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:43,981
Mia.

228
00:27:36,325 --> 00:27:39,286
Mia!

229
00:27:39,286 --> 00:27:41,455
Mia!

230
00:27:44,583 --> 00:27:46,668
- Mia!
- Oh, shit.

231
00:27:49,421 --> 00:27:50,714
Oh my God.

232
00:28:00,724 --> 00:28:02,226
Hey, how is she doing?

233
00:28:03,727 --> 00:28:05,813
She's talking about a woman
in the woods.

234
00:28:05,813 --> 00:28:07,523
How the forest attacked her.

235
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:10,943
I don't know.
It's just crazy withdrawal talk.

236
00:28:10,943 --> 00:28:13,237
Well, don't you think
we should take her to a hospital?

237
00:28:13,237 --> 00:28:15,239
I think we're in over our heads here.

238
00:28:15,239 --> 00:28:19,326
Okay, I'm giving her the exact same
treatment she would get at a hospital.

239
00:28:22,496 --> 00:28:26,208
If we leave now, all of this mess
would've been for nothing.

240
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:28,669
Ok, what about the wounds
on her arms?

241
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:32,256
I pulled some thorns out.

242
00:28:32,256 --> 00:28:35,008
Looks like she ran into
a thorn bush out there.

243
00:28:35,008 --> 00:28:38,011
She probably did it on purpose.

244
00:28:38,011 --> 00:28:38,846
What?

245
00:28:40,806 --> 00:28:42,850
David...

246
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:45,894
From now on, she is gonna do
whatever it takes to get out of here.

247
00:29:04,455 --> 00:29:05,205
Mia.

248
00:29:07,541 --> 00:29:10,294
Listen, you've gotta get out
of those clothes.

249
00:29:10,294 --> 00:29:12,212
- Right? Take a shower.
- David.

250
00:29:14,006 --> 00:29:15,299
Please...

251
00:29:16,592 --> 00:29:18,218
Please...

252
00:29:19,344 --> 00:29:23,724
You have to get me...

253
00:29:23,724 --> 00:29:25,100
out of here.

254
00:29:28,312 --> 00:29:30,647
Yeah, but nobody said
this was going to be easy.

255
00:29:30,647 --> 00:29:31,148
No.

256
00:29:34,193 --> 00:29:36,195
You don't understand.

257
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:40,073
There was something
in the woods, David.

258
00:29:45,162 --> 00:29:52,044
And I think it's in here with us now.

259
00:29:52,836 --> 00:29:55,005
What? Here in the room?

260
00:30:09,853 --> 00:30:11,647
Look, you know
it's all in your head.

261
00:30:13,106 --> 00:30:15,108
Just try to get it together.

262
00:30:16,985 --> 00:30:21,073
You'll feel better tomorrow, Okay?
You'll be glad we were such assholes.

263
00:30:24,201 --> 00:30:24,868
Okay.

264
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,451
Eric, what are you doing in here?

265
00:31:05,451 --> 00:31:07,411
Please, would you just
get rid of that thing?

266
00:31:07,411 --> 00:31:10,122
You should be downstairs
helping your friend clean up that mess.

267
00:31:11,331 --> 00:31:14,001
I don't know
who you're talking about.

268
00:31:14,001 --> 00:31:16,587
Come'on, don't act
like you don't care about him.

269
00:31:16,587 --> 00:31:18,255
I know you do.

270
00:31:19,381 --> 00:31:24,470
Well, I think we can all agree, he hasn't
cared about us for the past freaking century.

271
00:31:25,762 --> 00:31:27,431
Well, he is here now.

272
00:31:29,641 --> 00:31:30,309
Yeah.

273
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,604
Truly amazing.

274
00:32:06,094 --> 00:32:07,471
Grandpa?

275
00:32:12,976 --> 00:32:14,353
Grandpa?

276
00:32:21,109 --> 00:32:22,986
Grandpa?

277
00:32:22,986 --> 00:32:26,406
Come here, boy.
Fuck!

278
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,793
Grandpa.

279
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:41,713
No, no, no.

280
00:32:42,756 --> 00:32:44,424
Here, boy.

281
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:54,434
What did you hit into?

282
00:32:55,769 --> 00:32:56,520
Fuck.

283
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,190
What happened?

284
00:33:20,961 --> 00:33:23,297
- Mia?
- She's in the shower.

285
00:33:24,006 --> 00:33:26,800
What happened? David?

286
00:33:28,802 --> 00:33:29,636
Mia?

287
00:33:31,305 --> 00:33:32,848
Mia, open the door.

288
00:33:36,351 --> 00:33:38,145
Mia, open the door.

289
00:33:38,687 --> 00:33:41,356
- Mia, open the door!
- David, what is wrong?

290
00:33:44,067 --> 00:33:46,236
David, stop
and tell me what's going on.

291
00:33:46,236 --> 00:33:49,531
Mia, open the fucking door!

292
00:33:55,329 --> 00:33:58,415
Mia, open the fucking door!

293
00:33:58,415 --> 00:33:59,541
David!

294
00:34:01,835 --> 00:34:02,920
David!

295
00:34:05,422 --> 00:34:06,256
Mia!

296
00:34:11,637 --> 00:34:12,137
Mia?

297
00:34:14,306 --> 00:34:15,098
Mia?

298
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:19,812
Olivia!

299
00:34:21,605 --> 00:34:24,566
Holy, shit!
Mia!

300
00:34:36,495 --> 00:34:37,329
Shit!

301
00:34:38,831 --> 00:34:40,624
This is insane!

302
00:34:48,006 --> 00:34:49,424
Fuck! Where is it?

303
00:35:15,909 --> 00:35:18,579
This can't be happening.

304
00:35:42,644 --> 00:35:44,146
I...um... I...

305
00:35:44,938 --> 00:35:47,733
I gave her sedative,
so she should be up for a couple of hours.

306
00:35:49,568 --> 00:35:54,406
But, fuck. Her burns are serious.
Like, second, third degree.

307
00:35:54,406 --> 00:35:56,116
This is so wrong.

308
00:35:56,116 --> 00:35:58,368
Look, nobody could have known
that she would do something so twisted.

309
00:35:58,368 --> 00:36:00,287
No, you should've known.

310
00:36:00,287 --> 00:36:02,664
We've all been following your way
since we got here.

311
00:36:04,291 --> 00:36:05,959
We should've left
when Mia wanted to.

312
00:36:05,959 --> 00:36:10,088
Baby, please!
Okay, let's not lose our heads. Okay?

313
00:36:10,088 --> 00:36:12,174
With any luck, it'll stop raining
in a couple of hours,

314
00:36:12,174 --> 00:36:13,926
and we'll be able to cross the creek
in the morning,

315
00:36:13,926 --> 00:36:15,594
and we'll take her to a hospital.

316
00:36:15,594 --> 00:36:19,223
Okay?
Everything is gonna be fine.

317
00:36:19,223 --> 00:36:21,183
Everything is gonna be fine?

318
00:36:22,643 --> 00:36:24,770
Everything is gonna be fine.

319
00:36:26,855 --> 00:36:31,276
I don't know if you'd noticed this,
but nothing is been fine.

320
00:36:31,276 --> 00:36:35,155
But everything is been getting worse,
every second.

321
00:36:40,244 --> 00:36:41,078
Mia?

322
00:36:49,628 --> 00:36:50,420
Mia?

323
00:36:52,589 --> 00:36:54,174
What are you doing?

324
00:36:58,345 --> 00:37:00,055
Mia, put the gun down.

325
00:37:01,348 --> 00:37:03,183
Put the gun down, please.

326
00:37:08,438 --> 00:37:09,273
Mia!

327
00:37:11,316 --> 00:37:14,236
Put the fucking gun!

328
00:37:21,201 --> 00:37:22,453
Oh my God!

329
00:37:23,287 --> 00:37:29,001
You will die, like the others!
One by one, we will take you!

330
00:37:31,712 --> 00:37:35,591
You're all going to die tonight.

331
00:37:37,885 --> 00:37:41,680
The gun! The gun, quickly!

332
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,598
Baby?

333
00:38:02,951 --> 00:38:03,786
Mia?

334
00:38:14,129 --> 00:38:16,632
Let me out!

335
00:38:16,632 --> 00:38:18,801
- Let me out!
- She's totally psychotic.

336
00:38:18,801 --> 00:38:21,428
Oh my God,
What happened to her eyes?

337
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:33,232
What's she doing?

338
00:38:33,232 --> 00:38:35,234
Sounds like she's flinging herself
against something.

339
00:38:35,234 --> 00:38:37,069
This is impossible.

340
00:38:37,069 --> 00:38:39,154
I just gave her enough sedative
to put a horse to sleep!

341
00:38:39,154 --> 00:38:41,073
So give her another shot!

342
00:38:42,574 --> 00:38:44,159
It could bring her into a coma.

343
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:46,787
For Christ's sake, Olivia,
she's going to kill herself down there!

344
00:38:48,205 --> 00:38:49,790
Go get the shot!

345
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,127
I gotta get the shrapnel
out of my ram.

346
00:38:53,127 --> 00:38:55,879
What? I have tweezers in my purse.

347
00:38:57,005 --> 00:38:59,133
David. Listen to me.

348
00:38:59,133 --> 00:39:03,679
I don't think a tranquilizer
is gonna do shit.

349
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:06,598
'Cause I don't think we're dealing
with a freaking panic attack here!

350
00:39:07,224 --> 00:39:08,725
I'm scared that
what's happening to Mia...

351
00:39:08,725 --> 00:39:11,854
has something to do with that
fucking witchcraft in the basement.

352
00:40:35,813 --> 00:40:37,105
Olivia?

353
00:40:46,406 --> 00:40:47,699
Olivia?

354
00:41:10,472 --> 00:41:11,765
Olivia?

355
00:41:13,142 --> 00:41:14,977
Are you okay?

356
00:41:21,775 --> 00:41:23,068
Olivia?

357
00:41:45,257 --> 00:41:48,886
Olivia?
What are you doing in there?

358
00:41:52,431 --> 00:41:53,640
Olivia.

359
00:41:57,186 --> 00:41:58,479
Olivia?

360
00:42:02,524 --> 00:42:04,359
Are you okay?

361
00:42:09,156 --> 00:42:10,908
Oh my God!

362
00:42:10,908 --> 00:42:13,243
Why the fuck did you do that?

363
00:42:35,224 --> 00:42:36,350
Kill him.

364
00:43:16,265 --> 00:43:16,807
No!

365
00:43:28,861 --> 00:43:33,157
She tried to kill me.
She tried to kill me.

366
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:51,633
Fuck it.

367
00:43:54,595 --> 00:43:56,305
Hold that. You got it?

368
00:44:07,524 --> 00:44:09,902
Hold here, okay? Hold.

369
00:44:09,902 --> 00:44:10,861
Fuck it.

370
00:44:14,198 --> 00:44:18,827
David, I did something terrible.

371
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:21,288
I'm sure you didn't mean to hurt her.

372
00:44:21,288 --> 00:44:24,541
That thing I killed, was not Olivia.

373
00:44:24,541 --> 00:44:26,043
He's losing too much blood.

374
00:44:26,043 --> 00:44:28,712
Baby, he needs
water and sugar, okay? Go.

375
00:44:29,797 --> 00:44:31,924
- Go!
- Okay, okay.

376
00:44:35,427 --> 00:44:37,346
- Alright.
- David...

377
00:44:38,972 --> 00:44:44,853
I read a passage from that book.
It was some sort of a prayer.

378
00:44:46,146 --> 00:44:48,440
I unleashed something, David.

379
00:44:50,067 --> 00:44:53,862
I unleashed something evil.

380
00:45:55,174 --> 00:45:56,467
Natalie?

381
00:46:05,559 --> 00:46:06,393
Mia?

382
00:46:08,187 --> 00:46:09,396
Natalie.

383
00:46:14,234 --> 00:46:16,487
What am I doing down here?

384
00:46:18,739 --> 00:46:20,574
My leg's hurt.

385
00:46:22,409 --> 00:46:24,661
I can't move.

386
00:46:27,831 --> 00:46:29,541
I'm coming down there, okay?

387
00:46:31,794 --> 00:46:35,339
Why did you lock me down here?

388
00:46:35,339 --> 00:46:40,552
- You were supposed to help me.
- Hey, we're trying to help you. Okay?

389
00:46:41,053 --> 00:46:44,473
You were out of control, you know?

390
00:46:44,473 --> 00:46:47,142
You got violent and we didn't know
what else to do.

391
00:46:48,393 --> 00:46:52,231
Mia, I think something
really terrible was happened,

392
00:46:52,231 --> 00:46:54,191
and we have
to get out of here now, okay?

393
00:46:54,191 --> 00:46:59,571
You don't understand...
He's not gonna let you leave.

394
00:47:00,823 --> 00:47:03,158
And he's not gonna stop
until he has you.

395
00:47:04,159 --> 00:47:06,245
Until he has all of you!

396
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:20,944
I can smell your filthy soul.

397
00:48:47,721 --> 00:48:49,723
Kiss me, you dirty cunt!

398
00:49:08,033 --> 00:49:11,120
Why don't you come down here
and let me suck your cock, pretty boy?

399
00:49:11,453 --> 00:49:14,331
- Mia...
- Mia is not here, you fucking idiot!

400
00:49:16,041 --> 00:49:18,919
Your little sister is been raped in hell!

401
00:49:34,601 --> 00:49:36,728
I wanna go home.

402
00:49:53,412 --> 00:49:54,371
Eric?

403
00:49:56,415 --> 00:49:58,876
I don't know why,
but I thought that this would end it.

404
00:50:01,545 --> 00:50:05,299
But this book, does not burn.

405
00:50:07,384 --> 00:50:10,012
It does not fucking burn.

406
00:50:12,806 --> 00:50:14,892
Tell me what's going on here.

407
00:50:28,238 --> 00:50:31,283
This book, using some...

408
00:50:32,951 --> 00:50:34,828
ancient alphabet.

409
00:50:34,828 --> 00:50:39,291
Here's some translations,
but it's just a scattered written notes.

410
00:50:40,167 --> 00:50:42,085
They all refer to some...

411
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:46,298
"evil entity"...

412
00:50:46,298 --> 00:50:48,258
A taker of souls.

413
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:51,053
A demon.

414
00:50:52,846 --> 00:50:54,389
It says...

415
00:50:56,016 --> 00:50:58,352
Once he feasts on five souls,

416
00:50:58,352 --> 00:51:03,023
the sky will bleed again,
and the abomination...

417
00:51:03,023 --> 00:51:05,609
will rise from hell.

418
00:51:48,193 --> 00:51:49,570
This is insane.

419
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:54,324
This "thing" is attached
to Mia's soul like a leech.

420
00:51:54,324 --> 00:51:56,660
It's becoming her.

421
00:51:56,660 --> 00:52:01,582
If we wanna stop this,
if we want to help Mia...

422
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:12,426
I think we gonna have to kill her.

423
00:52:12,426 --> 00:52:14,803
- What did you say?
- If everything said...

424
00:52:14,803 --> 00:52:18,182
Eric!
We're not gonna fucking kill anybody!

425
00:52:18,182 --> 00:52:20,350
Are you listening to yourself?

426
00:52:21,643 --> 00:52:23,979
What about those dead cats
down the basement?

427
00:52:23,979 --> 00:52:25,689
I mean, maybe they had some disease.

428
00:52:25,689 --> 00:52:28,275
I mean, some virus that...
it spread to Mia...

429
00:52:28,275 --> 00:52:32,237
and then she passed it to Olivia,
when she puked all over her face.

430
00:52:32,237 --> 00:52:37,284
But what kind of a virus, makes a person
cutoff their face with a piece of glass?

431
00:52:40,621 --> 00:52:42,623
Oh my God!
Oh God!

432
00:52:57,888 --> 00:53:01,433
I don't know,
what we're dealing with here. Okay?

433
00:53:01,433 --> 00:53:02,935
But it stopped raining,

434
00:53:02,935 --> 00:53:05,395
and in a couple of hours,
the river will be clear,

435
00:53:05,395 --> 00:53:09,358
and we're gonna get out
of this place, all of us.

436
00:53:09,358 --> 00:53:12,111
It doesn't matter where we go.

437
00:53:12,111 --> 00:53:14,905
If we don't do something right now,

438
00:53:14,905 --> 00:53:17,533
we're all gonna be dead by then!

439
00:53:55,028 --> 00:53:57,114
Don't do it, you little bitch!
Don't cut it off!

440
00:54:05,956 --> 00:54:07,749
Don't cut it off!

441
00:54:07,749 --> 00:54:09,042
Fuck you!

442
00:54:16,633 --> 00:54:19,386
No, no, no, no, no!

443
00:54:20,804 --> 00:54:21,889
No, no!

444
00:54:43,852 --> 00:54:47,981
I had to do it.
It feels much better now.

445
00:55:00,619 --> 00:55:03,622
Hold on, baby.
Hold on, please.

446
00:55:03,747 --> 00:55:07,710
Eric and I, we're gonna,
we're gonna put stop to this, okay?

447
00:55:08,064 --> 00:55:10,564
I promise you,
everything's gonna be fine.

448
00:55:10,564 --> 00:55:13,526
Okay? Okay, baby?

449
00:55:13,526 --> 00:55:16,487
She just cut her fucking arm off.

450
00:55:16,487 --> 00:55:18,364
Does this sound fine?

451
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:33,296
These inscriptions are confusing
and sometimes contradictory.

452
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:35,548
But they're consistent
about one thing:

453
00:55:36,882 --> 00:55:42,096
In order to stop this,
the possessed must be cleansed.

454
00:55:42,096 --> 00:55:44,056
Purified.

455
00:55:44,473 --> 00:55:47,518
The book describes three specific ways.

456
00:55:49,937 --> 00:55:51,897
A live burial...

457
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:59,989
bodily dismemberment...

458
00:56:03,534 --> 00:56:06,454
and purification by fire.

459
00:56:10,583 --> 00:56:12,126
Are you sure that this will work?

460
00:56:14,003 --> 00:56:15,379
If we...

461
00:56:17,882 --> 00:56:22,386
If I killed my sister,
she'll be at peace?

462
00:56:22,386 --> 00:56:27,600
Am I sure? Of course not.
This is not a science book.

463
00:56:28,726 --> 00:56:30,645
But look, I'm sure of one thing.

464
00:56:30,645 --> 00:56:35,149
Whatever is inside Mia,
is the cause of all this.

465
00:56:35,775 --> 00:56:39,028
If she dies,
then this thing is gonna die with her.

466
00:56:39,028 --> 00:56:41,238
What if she just lost her mind?

467
00:56:43,699 --> 00:56:45,451
What if she just needs a doctor?

468
00:56:45,451 --> 00:56:47,203
What? A doctor?

469
00:56:48,913 --> 00:56:52,458
My Mom died in a mental hospital,
she was crazy.

470
00:56:52,458 --> 00:56:54,877
She was deranged,
she was a monster.

471
00:56:56,796 --> 00:56:59,674
I've always feared that me and Mia
would end up like her.

472
00:57:08,057 --> 00:57:11,143
You're just a fucking coward.

473
00:57:12,353 --> 00:57:14,438
You know exactly
what we have to do,

474
00:57:14,438 --> 00:57:16,983
but you're too scared
to go through with it.

475
00:57:18,234 --> 00:57:20,778
I'm gonna burn
this fucking place down.

476
00:57:20,778 --> 00:57:22,947
and I'm gonna end this nightmare.

477
00:57:24,699 --> 00:57:27,493
Why don't you just run away?

478
00:57:27,994 --> 00:57:31,330
Go hide beneath some rock
somewhere.

479
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:33,749
You know, You're great at that.

480
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:41,090
Oh, shit!

481
00:58:57,416 --> 00:58:59,168
Where the fuck did she go?

482
00:58:59,627 --> 00:59:00,628
David.

483
00:59:02,171 --> 00:59:04,674
Take it before she does.

484
00:59:40,293 --> 00:59:41,335
No!

485
00:59:43,963 --> 00:59:45,256
Stop!

486
00:59:54,932 --> 00:59:57,601
No, no, no, no!

487
00:59:57,601 --> 01:00:00,313
No!
No, no, no!

488
01:00:27,798 --> 01:00:29,300
David.

489
01:00:36,932 --> 01:00:38,809
Why are you hurting me?

490
01:00:46,776 --> 01:00:48,611
My face hurts.

491
01:00:50,571 --> 01:00:51,822
Why?

492
01:00:53,074 --> 01:00:56,786
Why? Why's my face hurt me?

493
01:00:58,245 --> 01:01:00,247
Baby, baby...

494
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:02,625
Nat, Nat.

495
01:01:37,785 --> 01:01:40,788
Come on. Come on, man.
Here we are.

496
01:01:45,334 --> 01:01:48,087
Hey, hey, hey!
Hold on!

497
01:01:48,087 --> 01:01:50,047
Don't die on me, please.

498
01:01:50,715 --> 01:01:53,426
It wouldn't be so bad right now.

499
01:01:55,886 --> 01:01:59,890
I just don't want to become
the devil's bitch.

500
01:02:03,894 --> 01:02:05,813
I'm gonna do what I gotta do.

501
01:02:07,898 --> 01:02:10,359
I'm gonna do what I gotta do, OK?

502
01:02:58,407 --> 01:03:00,117
I'm sorry, Mia.

503
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:02,828
I love you.

504
01:03:04,872 --> 01:03:12,046
Baby, little baby,
it's time to say goodbye.

505
01:03:12,964 --> 01:03:20,513
Baby, little baby,
I'll miss you day and night.

506
01:03:21,055 --> 01:03:27,645
Baby, my sweet baby,
I'll write you everyday.

507
01:03:28,479 --> 01:03:36,529
Baby, don't cry baby.
I wish that I can stay.

508
01:03:37,238 --> 01:03:38,906
I can't do this.

509
01:03:41,284 --> 01:03:42,952
I can't do this.

510
01:04:16,986 --> 01:04:21,282
This time... the only fucking way...
is the hard way!

511
01:05:01,906 --> 01:05:03,783
David.

512
01:05:04,951 --> 01:05:07,328
Murderer.

513
01:05:08,996 --> 01:05:10,581
Coward.

514
01:07:12,828 --> 01:07:14,372
Eric.

515
01:07:34,433 --> 01:07:36,227
Hey, are you okay?

516
01:07:38,604 --> 01:07:39,605
David.

517
01:07:41,607 --> 01:07:43,401
I missed you, man.

518
01:07:47,613 --> 01:07:49,949
You know that, buddy.

519
01:09:10,154 --> 01:09:11,155
David.

520
01:09:13,783 --> 01:09:15,326
David?

521
01:09:15,868 --> 01:09:19,246
I can't move! I can't breath!

522
01:09:19,622 --> 01:09:20,665
David?

523
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:24,377
Help me!

524
01:09:24,794 --> 01:09:26,963
Help me, David!

525
01:09:26,963 --> 01:09:29,590
- You're not her.
- David!

526
01:09:30,466 --> 01:09:32,301
Help me!

527
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:33,844
You're not her!

528
01:09:40,476 --> 01:09:42,645
Why do you hate me David?

529
01:09:45,147 --> 01:09:47,066
I know you do.

530
01:09:48,401 --> 01:09:50,236
You left home.

531
01:09:51,362 --> 01:09:55,950
You left me all alone
with our sick mother.

532
01:09:55,950 --> 01:09:57,785
And I was just a kid.

533
01:09:59,578 --> 01:10:01,038
You made me lie.

534
01:10:02,581 --> 01:10:07,962
Every time she screamed your name,
I told her you where coming to see her.

535
01:10:07,962 --> 01:10:10,464
Like you promise.

536
01:10:11,048 --> 01:10:13,050
But you never did.

537
01:10:14,176 --> 01:10:17,471
Please stop it.
I'm begging you.

538
01:10:18,639 --> 01:10:23,853
I know mother hates you now...
and she waits for you in hell.

539
01:10:33,112 --> 01:10:35,906
Shut up! Shut up!

540
01:10:53,341 --> 01:10:55,468
I'm so sorry, Mia.

541
01:10:59,388 --> 01:11:00,973
I should've been there.

542
01:11:02,808 --> 01:11:05,519
I should've been there for you.

543
01:12:00,616 --> 01:12:02,910
Come on. Please, come back.

544
01:12:09,125 --> 01:12:11,711
Come on, Mia! Come back for me!
Come on, please!

545
01:12:55,296 --> 01:12:57,673
Okay, you're in peace.

546
01:12:59,008 --> 01:13:01,052
You're in peace now.

547
01:13:27,745 --> 01:13:28,829
David?

548
01:13:35,252 --> 01:13:36,629
Mia?

549
01:13:43,135 --> 01:13:45,179
It was so horrible.

550
01:13:46,973 --> 01:13:49,433
It was so horrible.

551
01:13:49,809 --> 01:13:53,562
It's okay. It's all over now.

552
01:13:56,941 --> 01:14:00,027
Thanks for not leaving me, David.

553
01:14:08,494 --> 01:14:11,455
Wait here.
I'm gonna get the car keys.

554
01:14:11,455 --> 01:14:13,416
- Okay?
- Yeah.

555
01:15:17,146 --> 01:15:18,230
David?

556
01:15:18,856 --> 01:15:20,942
Go! Please, just go!

557
01:15:20,942 --> 01:15:22,234
Go!

558
01:15:22,234 --> 01:15:25,613
I'm not gonna go anywhere!
I'm not going anywhere!

559
01:15:29,742 --> 01:15:31,911
Mia, take the keys.
Look at me, let's go.

560
01:15:31,911 --> 01:15:33,579
Come on. Come on, let's go.

561
01:15:39,335 --> 01:15:40,962
Get out of here.

562
01:15:42,129 --> 01:15:45,424
No! No!

563
01:15:45,424 --> 01:15:46,801
David!

564
01:15:47,426 --> 01:15:49,387
David!

565
01:15:50,930 --> 01:15:55,601
No! No! No!

566
01:15:55,601 --> 01:15:58,980
David! David!

567
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:10,574
He's coming.

568
01:18:43,144 --> 01:18:45,396
Mia.

569
01:19:43,996 --> 01:19:45,665
Come here, bitch!

570
01:21:10,958 --> 01:21:11,917
Come on!

571
01:22:10,059 --> 01:22:13,020
You're gonna die here,
you pathetic junkie!

572
01:22:15,189 --> 01:22:17,984
I've had enough of this shit!

573
01:22:54,645 --> 01:22:58,232
I will feast on your soul!

574
01:23:01,277 --> 01:23:03,613
Feast on this, motherfucker!

575
01:23:15,666 --> 01:23:18,252
Die!

576
01:23:38,439 --> 01:23:40,650
Go back to hell, bitch!
