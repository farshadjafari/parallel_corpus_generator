1
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,402
This is Media-Break.

2
00:00:56,437 --> 00:01:00,406
You give us three minutes
and we'll give you the world.

3
00:01:00,441 --> 00:01:03,367
Good morning, I'm Casey Wong
with Jess Perkins.

4
00:01:03,402 --> 00:01:05,411
Top story, Pretoria.

5
00:01:05,446 --> 00:01:09,373
The threat of nuclear confrontation
in South Africa escalated today...

6
00:01:09,408 --> 00:01:12,335
...when the military government
of that besieged city-state...

7
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:15,213
...unveiled a French-made
neutron bomb...

8
00:01:15,248 --> 00:01:19,425
...and affirmed that it would use
it as the city's last line of defense.

9
00:01:21,511 --> 00:01:25,473
The president's first press conference
from the Star Wars Peace Platform...

10
00:01:26,516 --> 00:01:29,477
...got off to a shaky start
when power failed...

11
00:01:29,512 --> 00:01:33,356
...causing a period of weightlessness
for the president and his staff.

12
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,443
We'll be back in a moment.

13
00:01:37,478 --> 00:01:40,363
Is it time for that operation?

14
00:01:40,398 --> 00:01:43,366
This may be the most important
decision of your life.

15
00:01:43,401 --> 00:01:47,328
So come down and talk to one of our
qualified surgeons...

16
00:01:47,363 --> 00:01:49,330
...at the Family Heart Center.

17
00:01:50,373 --> 00:01:54,335
We feature the complete line
of hearts by Jensen and Yamaha.

18
00:01:55,336 --> 00:01:56,379
You pick the heart.

19
00:01:56,414 --> 00:01:59,298
Extended warranties. Financing.

20
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:01,300
Qualifies for health tax credit.

21
00:02:03,302 --> 00:02:07,598
And remember, we care.

22
00:02:07,633 --> 00:02:10,560
Three dead police officers,
one critically injured.

23
00:02:10,595 --> 00:02:14,564
Police leaders blame
Omni Consumer Products, OCP...

24
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:18,484
...the firm which recently agreed
with the city to fund and run...

25
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:21,487
...the Detroit Metro
Police Department.

26
00:02:21,522 --> 00:02:23,531
Dick Jones, president of OCP.

27
00:02:23,566 --> 00:02:27,452
Every policeman knows
there are inherent risks in his job.

28
00:02:28,369 --> 00:02:32,373
If you can't stand the heat,
you better stay out of the kitchen.

29
00:02:32,408 --> 00:02:36,419
Although wounded, Officer Frederickson
escaped and identified this man.

30
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:41,382
Clarence Boddicker, unofficial
crime boss of Old Detroit...

31
00:02:41,417 --> 00:02:45,261
...sought in connection with
the deaths of 31 officers.

32
00:02:45,296 --> 00:02:49,348
Today he is free while doctors
at Henry Ford Hospital...

33
00:02:49,383 --> 00:02:52,393
...fight to save
Officer Frank Frederickson.

34
00:02:52,428 --> 00:02:56,564
Good luck, Frank.

35
00:03:03,529 --> 00:03:06,574
Attempted murder?
It's not like he killed someone.

36
00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:09,535
This violates
my client's civil rights.

37
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:12,455
Make it assault and I can make
bail in cash, now.

38
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:16,417
Listen, your client's a scumbag,
you're a scumbag...

39
00:03:16,452 --> 00:03:19,420
...and scumbags see the judge.

40
00:03:19,455 --> 00:03:23,382
Now get out of my police station
and take Laughing Boy with you.

41
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:33,392
Hi.

42
00:03:33,427 --> 00:03:36,437
Murphy, transferring in
from Metro South.

43
00:03:36,472 --> 00:03:38,356
Nice precinct.

44
00:03:38,391 --> 00:03:40,316
Yeah, pretty good.

45
00:03:40,351 --> 00:03:42,652
You work for a living down here.

46
00:03:42,687 --> 00:03:46,572
Get your armor and suit up.

47
00:03:51,619 --> 00:03:54,580
- No, you can't get a cup of coffee.
- Oh, sarge.

48
00:03:54,615 --> 00:03:58,501
- Stark, any word on Frederickson?
- Still listed as critical.

49
00:03:58,536 --> 00:04:00,461
His wife must be going crazy.

50
00:04:00,496 --> 00:04:01,462
- Murphy?
- Yeah, that's me.

51
00:04:01,497 --> 00:04:02,463
- Manson.
- Hi.

52
00:04:02,498 --> 00:04:04,423
What brings you to paradise?

53
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:07,426
I think the OCP's moving
a lot of new guys here.

54
00:04:07,461 --> 00:04:11,389
Omni Consumer Products.
What a bunch of morons.

55
00:04:12,432 --> 00:04:16,519
They're gonna manage this department
right into the ground.

56
00:04:16,554 --> 00:04:18,479
- Where you from?
- Metro South.

57
00:04:18,514 --> 00:04:19,522
Welcome to hell.

58
00:04:19,557 --> 00:04:21,482
- Murphy?
- Yo.

59
00:04:21,517 --> 00:04:25,445
- Cut 10 guys loose on the east side.
- Try to get up when you're in a jam.

60
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,448
Try to get a Medevac
after you been jammed.

61
00:04:28,483 --> 00:04:32,535
I'll tell you what we should do.
We should strike.

62
00:04:45,465 --> 00:04:48,551
The funeral is tomorrow.

63
00:04:48,586 --> 00:04:52,555
Department requests all officers
not on duty to attend.

64
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:56,517
Any donations for the family
may be given to Cecil as usual.

65
00:05:00,396 --> 00:05:03,441
I don't want to hear any more
talk about strike.

66
00:05:03,476 --> 00:05:07,403
We're not plumbers,
we're police officers.

67
00:05:07,438 --> 00:05:11,449
And police officers don't strike.

68
00:05:13,284 --> 00:05:17,413
Murphy. Front and center.

69
00:05:33,596 --> 00:05:37,558
Ooh, tiger!

70
00:05:52,532 --> 00:05:56,494
Lewis, come here when you're finished
fucking around with your suspect.

71
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:04,460
This guy's gonna be your new partner.

72
00:06:04,495 --> 00:06:07,630
Murphy, meet Lewis.
Show him the neighborhood.

73
00:06:07,665 --> 00:06:09,632
Glad to know you, Murphy.

74
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:13,553
Pretty neat.

75
00:06:13,588 --> 00:06:17,598
I better drive
until you know your way around.

76
00:06:17,633 --> 00:06:21,561
I usually drive
when I'm breaking in a new partner.

77
00:06:41,497 --> 00:06:44,542
You really think
the old man will be there?

78
00:06:44,577 --> 00:06:46,502
Why invite us?

79
00:06:46,537 --> 00:06:50,381
All the division heads are bringing
their support teams. It's big.

80
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,633
They're green lighting Delta City.

81
00:06:52,668 --> 00:06:55,636
No way. They never
move ahead of schedule.

82
00:06:55,671 --> 00:06:59,640
Jones has the 209 series ready
and wants to show off.

83
00:06:59,675 --> 00:07:02,602
- Tough break, Bob.
- What?

84
00:07:02,637 --> 00:07:06,606
When ED 209 ran into serious delays...

85
00:07:06,641 --> 00:07:08,608
...the old man ordered a backup plan.

86
00:07:08,643 --> 00:07:10,693
95th floor, have a nice day.

87
00:07:10,728 --> 00:07:13,654
Probably to light a fire
under Jones' ass.

88
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:17,575
- Yeah.
- Old Bob here gets the assignment.

89
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,578
Nobody in Security Concepts
takes it seriously.

90
00:07:20,613 --> 00:07:23,539
Fucking Jones, I'd go
straight to the old man if I could.

91
00:07:23,574 --> 00:07:25,583
Don't mess with Jones.

92
00:07:25,618 --> 00:07:28,544
Be careful, man.
I hear Jones is a real shark.

93
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:30,546
- Who asked you, twerp?
- Bob.

94
00:07:30,581 --> 00:07:32,548
What's the problem with the police?

95
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:36,427
Their union's been bitching ever since
we took over. The usual stuff.

96
00:07:37,512 --> 00:07:39,514
But we'll turn things around.

97
00:07:39,549 --> 00:07:43,684
Good. Very good.
Let's get started.

98
00:07:48,648 --> 00:07:51,651
My friends.

99
00:07:51,686 --> 00:07:55,613
I've had this dream
for more than a decade now.

100
00:07:56,572 --> 00:08:00,576
A dream which I've invited
you all to share with me.

101
00:08:01,536 --> 00:08:05,581
In six months
we begin construction...

102
00:08:05,616 --> 00:08:08,584
...of Delta City.

103
00:08:08,619 --> 00:08:12,505
Where Old Detroit now stands.

104
00:08:14,465 --> 00:08:17,510
Old Detroit has a cancer.

105
00:08:17,545 --> 00:08:19,470
The cancer is crime.

106
00:08:19,505 --> 00:08:21,472
It must be cut out before we
employ the 2 million...

107
00:08:21,507 --> 00:08:24,517
...workers to breathe life
back into the city.

108
00:08:24,552 --> 00:08:28,729
Yes.

109
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:33,734
Shifts in tax structure have made the
economy ideal for corporate growth.

110
00:08:35,695 --> 00:08:38,656
But community services,
in this case law enforcement...

111
00:08:38,691 --> 00:08:41,701
...have suffered.

112
00:08:41,736 --> 00:08:45,621
I think it's time
we gave something back.

113
00:08:59,594 --> 00:09:03,514
Take a close look
at the track record of this company.

114
00:09:03,549 --> 00:09:06,559
You'll see that we've gambled...

115
00:09:06,594 --> 00:09:09,520
...in markets usually regarded
as nonprofit.

116
00:09:09,555 --> 00:09:13,483
Hospitals. Prisons.
Space exploration.

117
00:09:14,525 --> 00:09:18,780
I say, good business
is where you find it.

118
00:09:19,655 --> 00:09:23,701
As you know, we now have a contract
to run local law enforcement.

119
00:09:25,745 --> 00:09:27,747
But at Security Concepts...

120
00:09:27,782 --> 00:09:31,626
...we believe an efficient police
force is only part of the solution.

121
00:09:32,668 --> 00:09:35,671
No, we need something more.

122
00:09:35,706 --> 00:09:38,633
We need a 24-hour-a-day
police officer.

123
00:09:38,668 --> 00:09:41,636
A cop who doesn't need
to eat or sleep.

124
00:09:41,671 --> 00:09:45,598
A cop with superior firepower
and the reflexes to use it.

125
00:09:47,642 --> 00:09:49,560
Fellow executives...

126
00:09:49,595 --> 00:09:53,564
...it's a pleasure to introduce you
to the future of law enforcement.

127
00:09:58,611 --> 00:10:02,573
ED 209.

128
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:38,609
The Enforcement Droid series 209...

129
00:10:38,644 --> 00:10:41,612
...is a self-sufficient
law enforcement robot.

130
00:10:41,647 --> 00:10:45,575
209 is programmed for urban
pacification, but that's just a start.

131
00:10:46,576 --> 00:10:48,536
After a successful
tour in Old Detroit...

132
00:10:48,571 --> 00:10:52,665
...we can expect 209 to become the hot
military product for the next decade.

133
00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:57,753
- Dr. McNamara.
- We'll need a subject.

134
00:10:57,788 --> 00:10:58,754
- Mr. Kinney.
- Yes, sir.

135
00:10:58,789 --> 00:11:00,673
- Will you give us a hand?
- Yes, sir.

136
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:04,677
Mr. Kinney will help us simulate a
typical arrest and disarming procedure.

137
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:10,683
Mr. Kinney, use your gun
in a threatening manner.

138
00:11:11,684 --> 00:11:15,730
- Point it at ED 209.
- Yes, sir.

139
00:11:22,695 --> 00:11:24,655
Please put down your weapon.

140
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:28,576
You have 20 seconds to comply.

141
00:11:28,611 --> 00:11:32,580
I think you better
do what he says.

142
00:11:36,584 --> 00:11:40,755
You now have 15 seconds to comply.

143
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:44,884
You are in direct violation
of penal code 113, section 9.

144
00:11:45,802 --> 00:11:48,763
- You have five seconds to comply.
- Help me!

145
00:11:48,798 --> 00:11:52,767
- Four, three, two, one.
- Help me! Help!

146
00:11:52,802 --> 00:11:56,687
I am now authorized
to use physical force.

147
00:12:23,631 --> 00:12:24,632
Somebody want to call a paramedic?

148
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:28,761
- Let's go, Johnson.
- You pull the plug on this thing?

149
00:12:28,796 --> 00:12:31,848
All right, don't touch him.

150
00:12:31,883 --> 00:12:34,851
- Don't touch him!
- He didn't hear the gun drop.

151
00:12:34,886 --> 00:12:37,812
He didn't hear it?!

152
00:12:37,847 --> 00:12:41,691
Dick, I'm very disappointed.

153
00:12:42,733 --> 00:12:45,736
It's only a glitch.
A temporary setback.

154
00:12:45,771 --> 00:12:48,739
You call this a glitch?

155
00:12:48,774 --> 00:12:51,784
We're to begin
construction in six months.

156
00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:55,746
This setback could cost us
millions in interest costs alone.

157
00:12:55,781 --> 00:12:57,790
Not necessarily, sir.

158
00:12:57,825 --> 00:12:59,750
There's a Robocop program...

159
00:12:59,785 --> 00:13:02,712
...I developed as a contingency
against just this sort of thing.

160
00:13:02,747 --> 00:13:04,672
Thank you for your concern.

161
00:13:04,707 --> 00:13:08,634
- This is something we could...
- Wait a minute. Dick!

162
00:13:10,595 --> 00:13:14,640
Maybe what we need here
is a fresh perspective.

163
00:13:14,675 --> 00:13:17,810
Tell me about your plan.
How long will it take?

164
00:13:17,845 --> 00:13:21,856
We've restructured the police
department with some good candidates.

165
00:13:21,891 --> 00:13:24,859
We can go to prototype
within 90 days.

166
00:13:24,894 --> 00:13:25,860
Very good.

167
00:13:25,895 --> 00:13:29,864
Get your staff together. I'll expect
a presentation in 20 minutes.

168
00:13:30,823 --> 00:13:34,786
Thank you, sir.

169
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:42,794
That's how it is in the big leagues.
You see an opening, you go for it.

170
00:13:44,754 --> 00:13:47,840
Watch your back,
Jones will be looking for you.

171
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:51,719
Fuck Jones. He fumbled the ball
and I was there to pick it up.

172
00:13:51,754 --> 00:13:54,639
Too bad about Kinney, huh?

173
00:13:54,674 --> 00:13:57,600
That's life in the big city.

174
00:13:57,635 --> 00:13:59,644
When do we start?

175
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,815
As soon as some schmuck volunteers.

176
00:14:18,788 --> 00:14:21,791
Pretty fancy moves, Murphy.

177
00:14:21,826 --> 00:14:24,794
My son watches this cop show,
TJ Lazer.

178
00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:27,797
Lazer does this whenever
he kills a bad guy.

179
00:14:27,832 --> 00:14:31,759
- My kid thinks every good cop...
- You don't want to disappoint him.

180
00:14:32,718 --> 00:14:36,764
Yeah, well, role models can be
very important to a boy.

181
00:14:43,646 --> 00:14:45,648
Okay, I get a kick out of it.

182
00:14:45,683 --> 00:14:47,692
All units, sector nine...

183
00:14:47,727 --> 00:14:50,653
Well, that's...

184
00:14:50,688 --> 00:14:54,949
Why don't you drive?

185
00:14:58,911 --> 00:15:00,913
Shit!

186
00:15:00,948 --> 00:15:03,791
- I don't believe it!
- What?

187
00:15:03,826 --> 00:15:05,793
You burnt the fucking money!

188
00:15:05,828 --> 00:15:07,837
I had to blow the door!

189
00:15:07,872 --> 00:15:09,839
It's as good as marked, asshole.

190
00:15:09,874 --> 00:15:12,884
You stupid, stupid asshole!

191
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:15,803
- Clarence!
- What do you want?!

192
00:15:15,838 --> 00:15:19,724
We got a cop on our tail.

193
00:15:24,729 --> 00:15:26,731
- Come on, speed it up.
- Move it!

194
00:15:26,766 --> 00:15:29,692
- We ain't gonna outrun a cop.
- Slow down.

195
00:15:29,727 --> 00:15:32,695
- Are you crazy?
- Shut the fuck up and do it!

196
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:33,654
Just do it!

197
00:15:33,689 --> 00:15:37,742
This is 154. We're in pursuit
of suspect. Request backup.

198
00:15:38,826 --> 00:15:42,955
- Roger, 154. Backup unavailable.
- Give me your piece.

199
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,042
Backup ETA, 15 minutes.

200
00:15:46,077 --> 00:15:48,002
Bobby, get the door!

201
00:15:48,037 --> 00:15:50,922
- Everybody load up!
- Let's go, come on.

202
00:15:50,957 --> 00:15:54,842
- Okay.
- All right, here we go.

203
00:16:02,767 --> 00:16:04,811
- What the fuck?
- Where'd he go?

204
00:16:04,846 --> 00:16:05,770
Emil!

205
00:16:05,805 --> 00:16:09,774
He's up here!

206
00:16:22,745 --> 00:16:26,874
Get him!

207
00:16:32,004 --> 00:16:34,006
Shit, Clarence, my leg.

208
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:35,967
Leon, pick him up.

209
00:16:36,002 --> 00:16:38,845
- Ready?
- Nope, hang on.

210
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,848
Bobby.

211
00:16:41,883 --> 00:16:43,891
- Can you fly, Bobby?
- Clarence, no!

212
00:16:43,926 --> 00:16:47,854
Hit it!

213
00:17:10,835 --> 00:17:14,922
This is 154. We've located that van
in sector 3D. Where's backup?

214
00:17:16,007 --> 00:17:19,969
Backup unavailable. Estimate 20
minutes before units can arrive.

215
00:17:22,889 --> 00:17:25,933
Well, you call it.

216
00:17:25,968 --> 00:17:29,854
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

217
00:17:34,901 --> 00:17:36,819
Go.

218
00:17:36,854 --> 00:17:40,865
Stay in touch.

219
00:18:20,905 --> 00:18:23,866
Freeze.

220
00:18:23,901 --> 00:18:26,828
Okay, let's see those hands.

221
00:18:26,863 --> 00:18:28,788
Nice and easy.

222
00:18:28,823 --> 00:18:30,915
Sure.

223
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:34,919
Mind if I zip this up?

224
00:18:52,895 --> 00:18:55,982
We rob banks, but never
get to keep the money.

225
00:18:56,017 --> 00:18:59,944
We steal money to buy coke,
then sell the coke to make more money.

226
00:19:00,945 --> 00:19:04,991
- Capital investment, man.
- Why bother? We could just steal it.

227
00:19:05,026 --> 00:19:07,952
No better way to steal
than free enterprise.

228
00:19:07,987 --> 00:19:08,995
Smoke?

229
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:12,957
No, those things will kill you.

230
00:19:12,992 --> 00:19:17,003
You want to live forever?

231
00:19:27,889 --> 00:19:31,893
Don't move.

232
00:19:33,811 --> 00:19:36,814
Go ahead and do it.

233
00:19:36,849 --> 00:19:40,943
Dead or alive, you're coming with me.

234
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,033
Lewis?

235
00:19:47,068 --> 00:19:50,036
Lewis!

236
00:19:50,071 --> 00:19:51,996
I got a situation in here.

237
00:19:52,031 --> 00:19:54,999
Okay, tough guy, get up. Get up!

238
00:19:55,034 --> 00:19:57,960
Turn around and spread your legs.
That's right.

239
00:19:57,995 --> 00:20:02,006
Lewis, where are you?
You all right?

240
00:20:03,007 --> 00:20:03,966
Hands on your head.

241
00:20:04,001 --> 00:20:07,845
Lewis.

242
00:20:09,931 --> 00:20:13,851
Let us take over from here, Emil.

243
00:20:31,077 --> 00:20:32,078
Your ass is mine.

244
00:20:32,113 --> 00:20:35,081
No!

245
00:20:35,116 --> 00:20:39,001
Not yet, it ain't.

246
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:52,932
Well, what have we here?

247
00:20:52,967 --> 00:20:56,978
You a good cop, hotshot?

248
00:20:57,937 --> 00:20:59,897
Sure you are.

249
00:20:59,932 --> 00:21:03,901
You gotta be some kind of great cop.

250
00:21:03,936 --> 00:21:07,905
Come in here all by yourself.

251
00:21:10,867 --> 00:21:11,826
Where's your partner?

252
00:21:11,861 --> 00:21:13,995
Where's your partner?

253
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:17,081
Guys, the other one was upstairs.

254
00:21:17,116 --> 00:21:21,043
She was sweet.

255
00:21:21,078 --> 00:21:25,047
I took her out.

256
00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:31,053
I bet that really pisses you off.

257
00:21:34,974 --> 00:21:37,977
You probably don't think
I'm a very nice guy.

258
00:21:38,012 --> 00:21:39,937
Do you?

259
00:21:39,972 --> 00:21:43,941
I think you're slime.

260
00:21:45,902 --> 00:21:48,905
See, I got this problem.

261
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,990
Cops don't like me.

262
00:21:51,025 --> 00:21:54,911
So I don't like cops.

263
00:22:10,051 --> 00:22:14,097
Well, give the man a hand.

264
00:22:16,099 --> 00:22:20,061
He's all yours.

265
00:22:29,946 --> 00:22:31,989
- Look out.
- Turn around, man.

266
00:22:32,024 --> 00:22:35,993
Hey, pretty boy. Hey, over here.

267
00:22:57,181 --> 00:22:58,057
I'm out of ammo.

268
00:22:58,092 --> 00:23:02,145
Me too.

269
00:23:04,147 --> 00:23:08,067
Hey, Clarence! He is still alive

270
00:23:08,102 --> 00:23:12,071
Does it hurt? Does it hurt?

271
00:23:17,076 --> 00:23:21,080
Okay, fun's over.

272
00:23:24,876 --> 00:23:28,963
Okay, let's get out of here.

273
00:23:28,998 --> 00:23:32,925
Good night, sweet prince.

274
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,054
Hey, wait up. Wait up.

275
00:23:58,075 --> 00:24:02,079
Murphy.

276
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:21,974
- Get him over.
- Clear.

277
00:24:22,009 --> 00:24:26,062
Ventilate him. Get the mask.

278
00:24:39,117 --> 00:24:43,121
Okay, hit the door.

279
00:24:45,081 --> 00:24:49,085
- Let me get pressure.
- Mask him.

280
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,129
Got a pressure of 60 pel.

281
00:24:51,164 --> 00:24:55,007
We're gonna have to
intubate this guy.

282
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:00,972
All right, I got it in.
Breath sounds?

283
00:25:01,007 --> 00:25:04,016
- You're in.
- Other side.

284
00:25:04,051 --> 00:25:06,978
- Let's get the mask trousers up.
- Get the clothes off.

285
00:25:07,013 --> 00:25:10,106
Clothes off. Prep him
for a central line.

286
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:14,026
Let's get some blood drawn.
Type and crossing, six units.

287
00:25:19,198 --> 00:25:20,158
Pressure's dropping.

288
00:25:20,193 --> 00:25:24,203
Central line's in, getting
pressure back. Normal saline.

289
00:25:24,238 --> 00:25:28,124
Can you do that, Dad?

290
00:25:29,167 --> 00:25:32,128
- I really have to tell you something.
- Blood pressure?

291
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:36,132
- I've got 40 pel.
- All right.

292
00:25:41,137 --> 00:25:45,141
Coarse D-fib.
Okay, we gotta shock him.

293
00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:51,105
Put the Foley in.
Let's blow the mask trousers.

294
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:54,984
- Okay.
- Stand clear.

295
00:25:56,027 --> 00:25:59,030
Coarse D-fib.
Let's shock him again.

296
00:25:59,065 --> 00:26:03,284
Clear.

297
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:07,205
Flat line. Let's go,
intracardiac epinephrine.

298
00:26:11,209 --> 00:26:13,211
- All right, it's in.
- No pulse.

299
00:26:13,246 --> 00:26:17,173
Let's go ahead and shock
a flat line and then quit.

300
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:21,219
- Okay, everybody stand clear.
- Clear.

301
00:26:26,099 --> 00:26:29,102
All right, that's all we can do.
Let's call it.

302
00:26:29,137 --> 00:26:31,062
What's the time?

303
00:26:31,097 --> 00:26:35,108
6:15.

304
00:26:48,162 --> 00:26:51,124
Sharp.

305
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:55,211
It's starting to roll.

306
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:59,215
Shit!

307
00:27:02,218 --> 00:27:04,095
Bring in the L.E.D.

308
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:08,224
Lock it down.

309
00:27:13,146 --> 00:27:15,189
- He's on.
- What's the story?

310
00:27:15,224 --> 00:27:17,066
- We saved the left arm.
- What?

311
00:27:17,101 --> 00:27:21,070
We agreed on total body prosthesis.
Now lose the arm.

312
00:27:21,105 --> 00:27:24,073
Jesus, Morton.

313
00:27:24,108 --> 00:27:28,077
- Can he understand?
- We'll blank his memory, anyway.

314
00:27:28,112 --> 00:27:30,997
We should lose the arm.
What do you think?

315
00:27:31,032 --> 00:27:34,083
He signed a release when he joined
the force. And he's dead.

316
00:27:34,118 --> 00:27:38,212
We can do pretty much what we want.

317
00:27:38,247 --> 00:27:40,256
Lose the arm.

318
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:44,260
Shut him down. Prep him for surgery.

319
00:27:47,263 --> 00:27:50,308
The outer skin will be like this.

320
00:27:50,343 --> 00:27:52,310
It's titanium, laminated with Kevlar.

321
00:27:52,345 --> 00:27:56,189
Go ahead, shake his hand.

322
00:27:56,224 --> 00:28:00,234
Come here often? How you doing?

323
00:28:02,153 --> 00:28:04,113
Got a hell of a grip.

324
00:28:04,148 --> 00:28:06,073
It's 400 foot-pounds.

325
00:28:06,108 --> 00:28:08,117
He could crush
every bone in your hand.

326
00:28:08,152 --> 00:28:11,120
All right, attach it to his shoulder.

327
00:28:11,155 --> 00:28:15,082
I like that.

328
00:28:18,044 --> 00:28:22,131
You're gonna be a bad motherfucker!

329
00:28:27,261 --> 00:28:31,265
Hey, hey. Look, he's watching us!

330
00:28:37,355 --> 00:28:41,275
This is for you.

331
00:28:42,276 --> 00:28:46,155
Happy New Year.

332
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,160
We get the best of both worlds.

333
00:28:51,195 --> 00:28:53,121
The fastest reflexes possible today...

334
00:28:53,156 --> 00:28:55,164
...computer-assisted memory...

335
00:28:55,199 --> 00:28:59,127
...and a lifetime of on-the-street
officer programming.

336
00:28:59,162 --> 00:29:03,172
It is my great pleasure
to present to you...

337
00:29:04,173 --> 00:29:08,136
...Robocop.

338
00:29:09,178 --> 00:29:11,264
Come on, come on.

339
00:29:11,299 --> 00:29:13,266
That's for you.

340
00:29:13,301 --> 00:29:17,311
- That's for you.
- Go, Robo.

341
00:29:33,286 --> 00:29:35,288
I'm what you call a repeat offender.

342
00:29:35,323 --> 00:29:38,249
I will offend again.

343
00:29:38,284 --> 00:29:40,209
I get my orders from a higher source.

344
00:29:40,244 --> 00:29:44,172
Shut up, asshole.

345
00:29:47,175 --> 00:29:50,219
- Go through the side.
- A cell is set for observation.

346
00:29:50,254 --> 00:29:52,180
What's this all about?

347
00:29:52,215 --> 00:29:54,182
- Who's this?
- Sergeant John Reed.

348
00:29:54,217 --> 00:29:58,269
It's official OCP business,
so please, get lost.

349
00:29:58,304 --> 00:30:02,273
- We got four or five days...
- Hey, this is bullshit!

350
00:30:02,308 --> 00:30:06,319
I take my orders from...

351
00:30:20,249 --> 00:30:24,253
What is this shit?

352
00:30:43,189 --> 00:30:46,317
When at rest, you'll sit in a chair.

353
00:30:46,352 --> 00:30:48,277
Yes, I understand.

354
00:30:48,312 --> 00:30:49,278
What about tracking?

355
00:30:49,313 --> 00:30:53,324
We check his exact location
with one of these.

356
00:30:54,325 --> 00:30:55,284
How does he eat?

357
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:58,287
His digestive system is simple.

358
00:30:58,322 --> 00:31:02,291
This processor dispenses a paste
that sustains his organic systems.

359
00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:14,262
It tastes like baby food.

360
00:31:14,297 --> 00:31:18,307
Knock yourself out.

361
00:31:26,274 --> 00:31:28,234
- Let's start with tracking.
- Give me a grid.

362
00:31:28,269 --> 00:31:30,153
- Got it?
- Clear.

363
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:33,239
- Target.
- Check.

364
00:31:33,274 --> 00:31:37,285
Now follow.

365
00:31:38,327 --> 00:31:39,370
Check.

366
00:31:39,405 --> 00:31:41,330
Voice stress analyzer.

367
00:31:41,365 --> 00:31:44,333
- It's up.
- One, two...

368
00:31:44,368 --> 00:31:45,376
...three.

369
00:31:45,411 --> 00:31:47,378
- Check.
- Record.

370
00:31:47,413 --> 00:31:50,339
- Now playback.
- Bring it up 50%.

371
00:31:50,374 --> 00:31:52,341
Full frame.

372
00:31:52,376 --> 00:31:53,384
I think he's ready.

373
00:31:53,419 --> 00:31:57,346
- We got it.
- All right, clear out.

374
00:31:57,381 --> 00:31:59,348
What are your prime directives?

375
00:31:59,383 --> 00:32:01,309
Serve the public trust.

376
00:32:01,344 --> 00:32:03,269
Protect the innocent. Uphold the law.

377
00:32:07,231 --> 00:32:09,233
That's good.

378
00:32:09,268 --> 00:32:13,237
That's very good.

379
00:32:19,327 --> 00:32:23,414
I fucking love that guy.

380
00:32:58,282 --> 00:33:02,286
- It's Supercop.
- Look at that fucking gun.

381
00:33:17,427 --> 00:33:20,430
Shit!

382
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:23,433
- This guy is good.
- He's not a guy, he's a machine.

383
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:27,437
What are they gonna do?
Replace us?

384
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,362
Come on.

385
00:33:39,282 --> 00:33:40,283
- Reed.
- Yeah.

386
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:43,327
He needs a car.

387
00:33:43,362 --> 00:33:46,289
Thank you.

388
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:47,290
Sure.

389
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:48,249
Anytime.

390
00:33:48,284 --> 00:33:52,253
Oh, yeah. Go get 'em, boy.

391
00:34:25,411 --> 00:34:29,373
I'd buy that for a dollar.

392
00:34:32,335 --> 00:34:36,297
And guess what I'm going to do now?

393
00:34:39,342 --> 00:34:41,302
Happy birthday, Bixby.

394
00:34:41,337 --> 00:34:43,429
Is there anything else, sir?

395
00:34:43,464 --> 00:34:45,431
Empty the register
and put the money in the bag.

396
00:34:45,466 --> 00:34:47,475
Excuse me?

397
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:51,521
I said, give me your money, all of it,
and don't fuck with me!

398
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:53,481
Now move!

399
00:34:53,516 --> 00:34:55,441
Open the safe, pops.

400
00:34:55,476 --> 00:34:57,485
Open the goddamn safe!

401
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,403
- We don't have a safe.
- Shit.

402
00:34:59,438 --> 00:35:03,366
There's your goddamned safe!
Now open the son of a bitch.

403
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:06,452
Quit stalling.
You better open that son of a bitch!

404
00:35:06,487 --> 00:35:08,454
Come on!

405
00:35:08,489 --> 00:35:11,415
I'm gonna blow her brains out.

406
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:15,420
- I'll open the safe.
- Good boy.

407
00:35:16,504 --> 00:35:20,383
You better open that on the count
of three. One, two...

408
00:35:23,386 --> 00:35:25,388
Fuck me.

409
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:28,307
Drop the gun. You are under arrest.

410
00:35:28,342 --> 00:35:32,353
Fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me!

411
00:35:50,455 --> 00:35:54,500
Thank you for your cooperation.
Good night.

412
00:35:54,535 --> 00:35:58,421
I'll buy that for a dollar!

413
00:36:10,349 --> 00:36:14,395
No, please!

414
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:15,438
Don't touch me!

415
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:19,525
- Get away! Get away!
- We don't want your money!

416
00:36:22,487 --> 00:36:25,531
Take it easy.
We don't want to hurt you.

417
00:36:25,566 --> 00:36:26,616
Too much hair.

418
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:30,536
I know! We'll give her a haircut.

419
00:36:32,455 --> 00:36:33,498
- Hey, hey!
- What?

420
00:36:33,533 --> 00:36:37,460
There's more hair down there!

421
00:36:40,505 --> 00:36:44,467
No! Don't!

422
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:48,429
Please.

423
00:36:52,433 --> 00:36:55,394
Let the woman go.
You are under arrest.

424
00:36:55,429 --> 00:36:57,396
Shit.

425
00:36:57,431 --> 00:37:00,399
You better back up, pal,
because he's gonna do her!

426
00:37:00,434 --> 00:37:04,362
He's gonna kill her!

427
00:37:07,448 --> 00:37:11,536
He's gonna kill her!

428
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:19,544
Your move, creep.

429
00:37:19,579 --> 00:37:23,548
No problem. It's okay.

430
00:37:26,426 --> 00:37:27,510
Thank God.

431
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:31,431
I was so scared. Thank you.

432
00:37:31,466 --> 00:37:33,474
Thank you.

433
00:37:33,509 --> 00:37:36,477
Madam, you have suffered
an emotional shock.

434
00:37:36,512 --> 00:37:40,523
I will notify a rape crisis center.

435
00:37:50,408 --> 00:37:54,412
All units, sector six.
Please close intersections...

436
00:38:00,501 --> 00:38:04,589
I don't care.
Get those men by the stairs, now.

437
00:38:06,632 --> 00:38:10,553
Terrorism has never been a factor
in city politics before.

438
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:12,555
That changed today
when former councilman...

439
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,515
...Ron Miller entered
City Hall with a gun.

440
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:16,601
He's on the second floor...

441
00:38:16,636 --> 00:38:18,561
...holding Mayor Gibson
and his staff hostage.

442
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:22,482
We do believe that Miller
has killed one of the hostages.

443
00:38:23,524 --> 00:38:27,487
- Lieutenant, what's next?
- We wait. Terrorism is very tricky.

444
00:38:27,522 --> 00:38:31,491
Massive and immediate retaliation
is the best policy. Unfortunately...

445
00:38:31,526 --> 00:38:35,453
- Excuse us.
- Wait, where you going?

446
00:38:36,537 --> 00:38:40,416
Statement, please.

447
00:38:42,502 --> 00:38:46,506
Hey, let's have some crowd control.
Come on, get these people back!

448
00:38:46,541 --> 00:38:49,592
- Where the hell are you going?
- Keep him talking.

449
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:53,638
One quick question here!

450
00:38:54,597 --> 00:38:55,515
Who made you?

451
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:59,560
Are you invincible?

452
00:39:01,562 --> 00:39:03,606
Okay, Miller. Don't hurt the mayor.

453
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:05,566
We'll give you whatever you want.

454
00:39:05,601 --> 00:39:08,569
First, don't fuck with me.

455
00:39:08,604 --> 00:39:10,613
I'm a desperate man.

456
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:14,575
And second, I want some fresh coffee.

457
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:16,577
And third, I want a recount.

458
00:39:16,612 --> 00:39:19,580
No matter how it turns out,
I want my old job back.

459
00:39:19,615 --> 00:39:23,501
- Okay.
- And I want a bigger office.

460
00:39:23,536 --> 00:39:27,463
And I want a new car!
And I want the city to pay for it all!

461
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:31,509
- What kind of car, Miller?
- One with reclining leather seats...

462
00:39:31,544 --> 00:39:34,554
...that goes really fast
and gets really shitty gas mileage.

463
00:39:34,589 --> 00:39:38,641
How about the 6000 SUX?

464
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:39,684
Yeah.

465
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:42,603
Okay, sure.

466
00:39:42,638 --> 00:39:45,606
What about cruise control?
Does it have cruise control?

467
00:39:45,641 --> 00:39:47,525
No problem, Miller.

468
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:51,571
Let the mayor go,
we'll even throw in a Blaupunkt.

469
00:39:52,572 --> 00:39:54,532
Lieutenant, don't jerk me off!

470
00:39:54,567 --> 00:39:57,618
When people jerk me off, I kill them!

471
00:39:57,653 --> 00:40:01,581
You want to see?

472
00:40:04,625 --> 00:40:05,585
Get up, Your Honor. Get up!

473
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:09,464
Get up. Your public wants to see you.

474
00:40:10,465 --> 00:40:13,468
Nobody ever takes me seriously!

475
00:40:13,503 --> 00:40:14,427
We'll get serious now...

476
00:40:14,462 --> 00:40:18,473
...and kiss the mayor's ass goodbye!

477
00:40:28,691 --> 00:40:31,736
Robocop. Who is he? What is he?

478
00:40:31,771 --> 00:40:33,654
Where does he come from?

479
00:40:33,689 --> 00:40:35,573
He is OCP's newest soldier...

480
00:40:35,608 --> 00:40:38,618
...in their revolutionary
crime management program.

481
00:40:38,653 --> 00:40:40,620
OCP spokesmen claim
the fearless machine...

482
00:40:40,655 --> 00:40:42,580
...has crooks on the run
in Old Detroit.

483
00:40:42,615 --> 00:40:46,542
Today, kids at Lee Iacocca Elementary
got to meet in person...

484
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:49,545
...what their parents only
read about in comic books.

485
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,589
Excuse me, Robo...

486
00:40:51,624 --> 00:40:55,593
...any special message for all
the kids watching at home?

487
00:40:55,628 --> 00:40:58,554
Stay out of trouble.

488
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:01,557
More fighting in the Mexican crisis...

489
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:04,560
...when American troops joined
in a raid with Mexican Nationals...

490
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:08,523
...against rebel rocket
positions in Acapulco.

491
00:41:08,558 --> 00:41:09,690
Now this.

492
00:41:09,725 --> 00:41:13,694
Red alert. Red alert.

493
00:41:13,729 --> 00:41:15,738
You crossed my line of death.

494
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:17,615
You haven't dismantled
your MX stockpile.

495
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:20,660
Pakistan is threatening my border!

496
00:41:20,695 --> 00:41:24,622
That's it, buster.
No more military aid.

497
00:41:25,665 --> 00:41:27,667
Nuke 'em.

498
00:41:27,702 --> 00:41:28,668
Get them before they get you.

499
00:41:28,703 --> 00:41:32,547
Another quality home game
from Butler Brothers.

500
00:41:32,582 --> 00:41:36,592
Today labor leaders agreed to sanction
construction of OCP's Delta City...

501
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:40,555
...thereby creating one million
much-needed new jobs...

502
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:44,517
...despite questions about worker
safety in dangerous Old Detroit.

503
00:41:44,552 --> 00:41:48,563
Robert Morton, vice president,
Security Concepts, OCP.

504
00:41:48,598 --> 00:41:52,567
I can't comment on Delta City.
But I will tell you this:

505
00:41:52,602 --> 00:41:56,529
Security Concepts projects the end of
crime in Old Detroit within 40 days.

506
00:41:57,697 --> 00:42:01,784
There's a new guy in town.
His name's Robocop.

507
00:42:03,744 --> 00:42:07,832
Hey, hey, hey, Bobby-boy.
Vice president. Congratulations.

508
00:42:07,867 --> 00:42:10,710
- Handball Tuesday night?
- I would, Bill...

509
00:42:10,745 --> 00:42:13,629
...but I've got some models
coming to my place.

510
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:17,592
I'd buy that for a dollar.

511
00:42:19,552 --> 00:42:23,598
Welcome to the club, Bob.

512
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:28,603
You're making a name for yourself
in Security Concepts with Robocop.

513
00:42:28,638 --> 00:42:30,605
I try.

514
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,565
Let me in on the bottom line, pal.

515
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,525
I hear Jones was plenty pissed.

516
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:38,529
You know, he's got this killer rep,
but it's a smoke screen.

517
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:42,575
He's lost his teeth.
The guy's a pussy.

518
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:44,702
Are we talking about
the same Dick Jones?

519
00:42:44,737 --> 00:42:48,706
He's old, we're young. That's life.

520
00:43:00,635 --> 00:43:04,597
I gotta go. I got a meeting.

521
00:43:12,605 --> 00:43:15,608
Congratulations, Bob.

522
00:43:15,643 --> 00:43:17,652
Thanks.

523
00:43:17,687 --> 00:43:21,614
I remember when I was
a young executive at this company.

524
00:43:21,649 --> 00:43:24,617
We used to call
the old man funny names.

525
00:43:24,652 --> 00:43:26,577
"Iron Butt."

526
00:43:26,612 --> 00:43:28,579
"Boner."

527
00:43:28,614 --> 00:43:31,666
Once I even called him...

528
00:43:31,701 --> 00:43:35,586
..."asshole."

529
00:43:38,673 --> 00:43:40,591
But there was always respect.

530
00:43:40,626 --> 00:43:44,720
I always knew
where the line was drawn.

531
00:43:45,721 --> 00:43:49,725
And you just stepped over it,
buddy-boy.

532
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,728
You've insulted me.

533
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:55,606
And you've insulted this company
with your bastard creation.

534
00:43:55,641 --> 00:43:58,693
I had a guaranteed
military sale with ED 209.

535
00:43:58,728 --> 00:44:00,653
Renovation program.

536
00:44:00,688 --> 00:44:02,738
Spare parts for 25 years.

537
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:06,617
Who cares if it worked or not?

538
00:44:06,652 --> 00:44:10,621
The old man thought
it was pretty important, Dick.

539
00:44:18,671 --> 00:44:20,715
You know...

540
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:24,761
...he's a sweet old man.

541
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:28,806
And he means well.

542
00:44:28,841 --> 00:44:32,769
But he's not gonna live forever.

543
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:36,731
And I'm number two around here.

544
00:44:36,766 --> 00:44:40,651
Pretty simple math, huh, Bob?

545
00:44:41,652 --> 00:44:44,781
You just...

546
00:44:44,816 --> 00:44:47,825
...fucked with the wrong guy.

547
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:51,662
You're out of your fucking mind.

548
00:44:54,707 --> 00:44:57,668
You better pray...

549
00:44:57,703 --> 00:45:01,714
...that that unholy monster
of yours doesn't screw up.

550
00:45:20,817 --> 00:45:21,818
You hungry?

551
00:45:21,853 --> 00:45:25,780
No, thanks.

552
00:46:04,777 --> 00:46:08,823
Oh, no.

553
00:46:11,826 --> 00:46:14,746
Damn rebels blew up
the airport in Acapulco.

554
00:46:14,781 --> 00:46:18,750
Great, we were going there next week.
Hey, what was that?

555
00:46:23,713 --> 00:46:25,631
Hey, look.

556
00:46:25,666 --> 00:46:29,635
Bucket-boy's online.

557
00:46:42,732 --> 00:46:44,859
Hey. Hey!

558
00:46:44,894 --> 00:46:45,735
Halt. Stop!

559
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:47,862
Wait a minute!

560
00:46:47,897 --> 00:46:50,823
- What's going on?
- I don't know. He just left.

561
00:46:50,858 --> 00:46:53,868
He just left?

562
00:46:53,903 --> 00:46:56,829
Roosevelt!

563
00:46:56,864 --> 00:47:00,750
We got a problem.

564
00:47:00,785 --> 00:47:02,794
Out of the way.

565
00:47:02,829 --> 00:47:06,714
Take a look at this.

566
00:47:07,673 --> 00:47:11,761
Shit! Call Bob Morton.

567
00:47:19,644 --> 00:47:23,689
Jerry, book him.
I'll catch up with you later.

568
00:47:27,693 --> 00:47:28,778
Hello.

569
00:47:28,813 --> 00:47:31,739
I haven't really had a chance
to introduce myself.

570
00:47:31,774 --> 00:47:34,826
I'm Anne Lewis.

571
00:47:34,861 --> 00:47:38,871
Do you have a name?

572
00:47:42,917 --> 00:47:46,879
How can I help you, Officer Lewis?

573
00:47:46,914 --> 00:47:49,882
That's not really what I meant.

574
00:47:49,917 --> 00:47:50,842
Don't you have a name?

575
00:47:50,877 --> 00:47:52,802
Hold it. Sign right here.

576
00:47:52,837 --> 00:47:55,805
You don't understand. I'm OCP.

577
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,807
Murphy.

578
00:47:57,842 --> 00:48:01,769
It's you.

579
00:48:03,771 --> 00:48:06,732
You really don't remember me?

580
00:48:06,767 --> 00:48:07,692
Excuse me.

581
00:48:07,727 --> 00:48:09,735
I have to go.

582
00:48:09,770 --> 00:48:12,697
Somewhere, there is a crime happening.

583
00:48:12,732 --> 00:48:14,824
Stop!

584
00:48:14,859 --> 00:48:17,785
- What did you talk to him about?
- Nothing.

585
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:21,789
- Shit.
- Shit.

586
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:23,875
Stop!

587
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:27,879
Hey, you there! Stop!

588
00:48:31,924 --> 00:48:34,886
You're in a lot of trouble, officer.

589
00:48:34,921 --> 00:48:36,888
Come on.

590
00:48:36,923 --> 00:48:39,891
I was assured full cooperation
by this precinct.

591
00:48:39,926 --> 00:48:42,810
One of your grunts screws it up,
I'll have your job!

592
00:48:42,845 --> 00:48:44,812
- What's the update?
- Hard to know.

593
00:48:44,847 --> 00:48:48,733
- We have a glitch or what?
- He wasn't designed for somatic rest.

594
00:48:48,768 --> 00:48:50,860
He had a dream. A dream.

595
00:48:50,895 --> 00:48:52,779
This cop questioned him.

596
00:48:52,814 --> 00:48:55,656
I didn't question him.
I asked his name. He didn't know.

597
00:48:55,691 --> 00:48:57,784
Oh, great.

598
00:48:57,819 --> 00:49:01,788
Let me make it clear. He doesn't
have a name, he has a program.

599
00:49:01,823 --> 00:49:02,830
He's product.

600
00:49:02,865 --> 00:49:05,875
- Is that clear?
- Sure.

601
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:07,877
Pull him in.
Run a systems check, the works.

602
00:49:07,912 --> 00:49:10,797
Take him offline
because he had a dream?

603
00:49:10,832 --> 00:49:12,882
What, are you kidding?

604
00:49:12,917 --> 00:49:14,842
Let's get out of here.

605
00:49:14,877 --> 00:49:15,885
Listen, Reed.

606
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,887
Try to keep one thing in mind:

607
00:49:17,922 --> 00:49:20,848
This project doesn't concern cops.
It's classified.

608
00:49:20,883 --> 00:49:24,811
It's OCP. You got it, mister?

609
00:49:26,813 --> 00:49:28,815
Yeah, I got it.

610
00:49:28,850 --> 00:49:32,902
Good.

611
00:49:32,937 --> 00:49:34,821
Sorry, sarge.

612
00:49:34,856 --> 00:49:37,740
I fucked up.

613
00:49:37,775 --> 00:49:41,744
Forget it, kid.
This guy's a serious asshole.

614
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:16,779
Give me all your money, bookworm,
or I blow your brains out.

615
00:50:22,827 --> 00:50:26,789
Now fill it up on number seven.

616
00:50:30,793 --> 00:50:34,797
Don't do nothing stupid, man.

617
00:50:34,832 --> 00:50:38,885
I'm a good shot.

618
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:40,928
I can hit you from here.

619
00:50:52,982 --> 00:50:53,941
Hey, man...

620
00:50:53,976 --> 00:50:55,943
...what you reading in there?

621
00:51:00,907 --> 00:51:04,827
You a college boy or something?

622
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:09,832
I'll bet you think you're smart.
Think you could outsmart a bullet?

623
00:51:11,793 --> 00:51:13,878
What do you say we find out, huh?

624
00:51:13,913 --> 00:51:17,799
I'm talking to you!
What do you say, huh?

625
00:51:17,834 --> 00:51:21,886
I'm talking to you!

626
00:51:21,921 --> 00:51:25,932
Drop it.

627
00:51:26,933 --> 00:51:30,978
Dead or alive, you are coming with me.

628
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:35,983
I know you.

629
00:51:35,691 --> 00:51:37,693
You're dead.

630
00:51:38,611 --> 00:51:45,618
We killed you.

631
00:51:45,653 --> 00:51:49,705
We killed you.

632
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:04,637
We killed you.

633
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:51,601
Who are you?

634
00:52:51,636 --> 00:52:55,521
Who are you?

635
00:53:08,618 --> 00:53:10,620
Can I help you, sir?

636
00:53:10,655 --> 00:53:12,622
No.

637
00:53:12,657 --> 00:53:14,624
What is it exactly that you want?

638
00:53:16,709 --> 00:53:18,711
You can't enter here.

639
00:53:18,746 --> 00:53:21,714
Wait a second. Hey, just a minute.

640
00:53:21,749 --> 00:53:25,718
This is a restricted area.

641
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:33,643
He's in.

642
00:54:32,535 --> 00:54:38,708
Murphy, it's you.

643
00:55:35,765 --> 00:55:39,685
Welcome, shopper. Let's take
a stroll through your new home.

644
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:42,772
This is a one-family house
built by ZM Industries.

645
00:55:42,807 --> 00:55:44,690
Situated near schools and shops...

646
00:55:44,725 --> 00:55:48,694
...this progressive development
has a growth factor of seven.

647
00:56:10,633 --> 00:56:12,635
Wow.

648
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:16,722
Can you do that, Dad?

649
00:56:23,729 --> 00:56:26,732
Say, it doesn't matter
who cooks in your family...

650
00:56:26,767 --> 00:56:29,735
...because this kitchen
by Food Concepts...

651
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:31,737
...makes everything a snap.

652
00:56:51,674 --> 00:56:54,594
Dad.

653
00:56:54,629 --> 00:56:57,597
Come on, get your hat on.
Isn't he cute?

654
00:56:57,632 --> 00:57:01,684
Come on, Dad. Come on, Dad.

655
00:57:19,786 --> 00:57:23,873
I really have to tell you something.

656
00:57:25,792 --> 00:57:29,712
I love you.

657
00:57:31,714 --> 00:57:33,800
The master bedroom.

658
00:57:33,835 --> 00:57:37,804
Functional space
with a touch of elegance.

659
00:57:38,721 --> 00:57:42,642
Hey, have you thought it all over?
Why not make me an offer?

660
00:58:15,758 --> 00:58:19,846
Where is Clarence Boddicker?

661
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:28,688
Okay.

662
00:58:32,692 --> 00:58:36,863
- Shit.
- Let's talk.

663
00:58:39,866 --> 00:58:43,786
Son of a bitch!

664
00:58:45,872 --> 00:58:49,792
There's just something
about the way it sounds:

665
00:58:49,827 --> 00:58:51,794
"Vice president."

666
00:58:51,829 --> 00:58:54,797
It just turns me on.

667
00:58:54,832 --> 00:58:56,799
God, you girls are so great.

668
00:58:56,834 --> 00:58:58,801
I love to be with intelligent women.

669
00:58:58,836 --> 00:59:01,804
Smart is so sexy.

670
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:03,806
I know.

671
00:59:03,841 --> 00:59:06,809
Sometimes, I could just
think of something...

672
00:59:06,844 --> 00:59:10,813
...and it could just get me so horny.

673
00:59:11,814 --> 00:59:15,735
Yeah, well, a mind is
a terrible thing to waste.

674
00:59:16,736 --> 00:59:20,656
I get bored so easily.

675
00:59:21,657 --> 00:59:25,745
And you need lots
of stimulation, Bobby.

676
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:27,747
Yes, I do.

677
00:59:27,782 --> 00:59:31,834
- Don't move.
- I won't.

678
00:59:35,838 --> 00:59:37,840
Bob, save some for me.

679
00:59:37,875 --> 00:59:41,928
Don't worry.

680
00:59:42,845 --> 00:59:46,849
Must be the champagne. Stay here.

681
00:59:51,771 --> 00:59:55,858
How you doing?

682
00:59:55,893 --> 00:59:59,862
Bitches, leave.

683
00:59:59,897 --> 01:00:02,782
Gee, Bobby. Bye.

684
01:00:02,817 --> 01:00:05,701
You gonna call me?

685
01:00:05,736 --> 01:00:07,787
The fuck are you doing?

686
01:00:07,822 --> 01:00:10,790
Do you know who I am?

687
01:00:10,825 --> 01:00:14,794
If you think you'll get away
with this, you got...

688
01:00:15,711 --> 01:00:19,882
Goddamn it!

689
01:00:19,917 --> 01:00:21,884
Stop!

690
01:00:21,919 --> 01:00:25,888
I'll give you anything you want.
Just, please, don't kill me.

691
01:00:29,892 --> 01:00:31,894
Hello, buddy-boy.

692
01:00:31,929 --> 01:00:33,896
Dick Jones here.

693
01:00:33,931 --> 01:00:36,899
I guess you're on
your knees about now...

694
01:00:36,934 --> 01:00:39,819
...begging for your life.

695
01:00:39,854 --> 01:00:41,821
Pathetic.

696
01:00:41,856 --> 01:00:43,823
You don't feel so cocky now, do you?

697
01:00:43,858 --> 01:00:46,826
Whatever he's paying you,
I'll double it right now.

698
01:00:46,861 --> 01:00:50,747
You know what the tragedy is here?

699
01:00:50,782 --> 01:00:53,833
We could have been friends.

700
01:00:53,868 --> 01:00:56,836
But you wouldn't go
through proper channels.

701
01:00:56,871 --> 01:00:59,839
You went over my head.

702
01:00:59,874 --> 01:01:01,841
That hurt.

703
01:01:01,876 --> 01:01:05,928
But life goes on. It's an old story,
the fight for love and glory.

704
01:01:09,015 --> 01:01:11,934
It helps if you think of it as a game.

705
01:01:11,969 --> 01:01:14,937
Every game has a winner...

706
01:01:14,972 --> 01:01:18,941
...and a loser.

707
01:01:24,864 --> 01:01:28,951
I'm cashing you out, Bob.

708
01:01:49,806 --> 01:01:53,893
I don't think I want to pay that, Sal.

709
01:01:53,928 --> 01:01:57,980
I don't give a shit what you want.
I set the prices here.

710
01:01:58,015 --> 01:02:01,984
Listen, Sal, maybe you haven't heard.
I'm the guy who owns Detroit.

711
01:02:02,019 --> 01:02:04,987
You want space in my marketplace...

712
01:02:05,022 --> 01:02:06,906
...you'll have to give me
a volume discount.

713
01:02:06,941 --> 01:02:09,992
Not into discounts.

714
01:02:10,027 --> 01:02:13,830
Joe, show the man what we brought him
for Christmas.

715
01:02:20,837 --> 01:02:24,841
Think about it, chum.
Good business is where you find it.

716
01:02:31,764 --> 01:02:35,852
Okay, let me try
to put this in perspective.

717
01:02:35,887 --> 01:02:38,855
You've killed a bunch of cops.

718
01:02:38,890 --> 01:02:42,942
Word around is that you've got a lot
of heavy connections downtown.

719
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:47,947
You make a lot of my friends nervous.

720
01:02:49,949 --> 01:02:51,951
A lot of people...

721
01:02:51,986 --> 01:02:54,954
...want to see a guy like me...

722
01:02:54,989 --> 01:02:57,039
...put a guy like you out of business.

723
01:02:57,074 --> 01:03:00,877
I don't know.

724
01:03:00,912 --> 01:03:04,881
Maybe I'm just not
making myself clear.

725
01:03:05,882 --> 01:03:09,886
I don't want to fuck with you, Sal.

726
01:03:09,921 --> 01:03:11,971
But I got the connections.

727
01:03:12,006 --> 01:03:14,891
I got the sales organization.

728
01:03:14,926 --> 01:03:17,894
I got the muscle
to shove enough of this factory...

729
01:03:17,929 --> 01:03:20,897
...so far up your stupid wop ass...

730
01:03:20,932 --> 01:03:22,899
...that you'll shit snow for a year.

731
01:03:22,934 --> 01:03:26,986
Frankie,
blow this cocksucker's head off.

732
01:03:27,021 --> 01:03:30,907
Guns, guns, guns!

733
01:03:31,991 --> 01:03:32,992
Come on, Sal!

734
01:03:33,027 --> 01:03:36,996
The Tigers are playing tonight.

735
01:03:38,081 --> 01:03:41,918
I never miss a game.

736
01:03:44,921 --> 01:03:48,925
Just kidding.

737
01:03:59,936 --> 01:04:03,940
Go!

738
01:04:24,043 --> 01:04:28,047
Come quietly,
or there will be trouble.

739
01:04:29,048 --> 01:04:32,969
Fuck you!

740
01:05:43,956 --> 01:05:47,960
Oh, shit!

741
01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:09,065
Clarence Boddicker...

742
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:11,067
...you are under arrest.

743
01:06:11,102 --> 01:06:14,070
You have the right to remain silent.

744
01:06:14,105 --> 01:06:18,074
Fuck you!

745
01:06:21,077 --> 01:06:22,995
Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute!

746
01:06:23,030 --> 01:06:25,915
I'm protected, man.
I've got protection!

747
01:06:25,950 --> 01:06:29,919
- You have the right to an attorney.
- What is this shit?!

748
01:06:32,922 --> 01:06:34,924
Goddamn it.

749
01:06:34,959 --> 01:06:39,095
Goddamn it! Listen to me!
Listen to me, you fuck!

750
01:06:39,130 --> 01:06:43,099
It's another guy! He's OCP.
He's the senior president.

751
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:47,103
Anything you say
may be used against you.

752
01:06:47,138 --> 01:06:51,190
It's Dick Jones!

753
01:06:53,109 --> 01:06:57,113
Don't you care, you cocksucker?

754
01:06:57,148 --> 01:06:59,115
I work for Dick Jones!

755
01:06:59,150 --> 01:07:01,033
Dick Jones!

756
01:07:01,068 --> 01:07:05,121
He's the number two guy at OCP!
OCP runs the cops!

757
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:11,043
You're a cop!

758
01:07:12,128 --> 01:07:13,045
Cop...

759
01:07:24,056 --> 01:07:28,144
Yes, I am a cop.

760
01:07:31,063 --> 01:07:33,149
I don't like it either, but listen!

761
01:07:33,184 --> 01:07:35,151
You listen to me, asshole!

762
01:07:35,186 --> 01:07:39,238
You're talking about shutting down
a major metropolitan police force!

763
01:07:39,273 --> 01:07:42,158
Without cops,
this city would tear itself apart!

764
01:07:42,193 --> 01:07:45,161
The union voted for a strike
last night!

765
01:07:45,196 --> 01:07:46,079
We lost five guys last week!

766
01:07:46,114 --> 01:07:50,083
We're getting creamed out there.

767
01:07:58,091 --> 01:08:00,093
Book him.

768
01:08:00,128 --> 01:08:04,013
What's the charge?

769
01:08:05,098 --> 01:08:09,102
He's a cop killer.

770
01:08:13,106 --> 01:08:15,108
Shit!

771
01:08:15,143 --> 01:08:19,112
Just give me my fucking phone call.

772
01:08:26,202 --> 01:08:29,205
I understand. The lawyers
will have you out in 24 hours.

773
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:32,125
Just don't say anything else.

774
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:36,129
Jesus, you really screwed up.

775
01:09:37,106 --> 01:09:38,107
Don't you care?

776
01:09:38,142 --> 01:09:42,111
I work for Dick Jones! Dick Jones!

777
01:09:44,113 --> 01:09:47,116
I work for Dick Jones!

778
01:09:47,151 --> 01:09:51,120
He runs OCP! OCP runs the cops!

779
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:56,209
Come in, officer.

780
01:09:56,244 --> 01:09:58,211
I don't usually see anyone
without an appointment...

781
01:09:58,246 --> 01:10:00,129
...but in your case,
I'll make an exception.

782
01:10:00,164 --> 01:10:02,215
You are under arrest.

783
01:10:03,216 --> 01:10:04,217
On what charge?

784
01:10:04,252 --> 01:10:06,219
Aiding and abetting a known felon.

785
01:10:07,303 --> 01:10:11,140
Sounds like I'm in a lot of trouble.

786
01:10:12,225 --> 01:10:13,142
Better take me in.

787
01:10:13,177 --> 01:10:15,228
I will.

788
01:10:28,074 --> 01:10:32,161
What's the matter, officer?

789
01:10:32,196 --> 01:10:35,164
I'll tell you what's the matter.

790
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:39,168
It's a little insurance policy
called "Directive 4."

791
01:10:39,203 --> 01:10:43,339
My little contribution
to your psychological profile.

792
01:10:43,374 --> 01:10:47,260
Any attempt to arrest a senior officer
of OCP results in shutdown.

793
01:10:51,264 --> 01:10:55,268
What did you think?

794
01:10:55,303 --> 01:10:58,187
That you were
an ordinary police officer?

795
01:10:58,222 --> 01:10:59,188
You're our product...

796
01:10:59,223 --> 01:11:03,192
...and we can't have our products
turning against us.

797
01:11:07,029 --> 01:11:11,200
Still a little fight left in you.

798
01:11:15,121 --> 01:11:19,083
Maybe you'd like to meet
a friend of mine.

799
01:11:24,130 --> 01:11:27,216
I had to kill Bob Morton
because he made a mistake.

800
01:11:27,251 --> 01:11:31,304
Now it's time to erase that mistake.

801
01:12:40,289 --> 01:12:44,127
Get me Hedgecock!
There's trouble in the tower!

802
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:58,284
Prepare to fire.

803
01:13:58,319 --> 01:14:01,370
- Wait a second!
- He's a cop, for God's sake!

804
01:14:01,405 --> 01:14:04,290
- You can't do that!
- We have orders to destroy it!

805
01:14:04,325 --> 01:14:06,375
- Oh, shit!
- You're maniacs!

806
01:14:06,410 --> 01:14:10,296
Fire at will!

807
01:14:26,229 --> 01:14:30,233
Move in!

808
01:15:27,331 --> 01:15:31,377
Murphy, it's me.

809
01:15:32,378 --> 01:15:36,382
Lewis.

810
01:15:47,310 --> 01:15:50,354
Level three! He's on level three!

811
01:15:50,389 --> 01:15:51,314
Over here, over here!

812
01:15:51,349 --> 01:15:55,151
Open fire!

813
01:16:11,334 --> 01:16:13,336
It's back.

814
01:16:13,371 --> 01:16:16,380
Big is back.
Because bigger is better.

815
01:16:16,415 --> 01:16:20,301
6000 SUX,
an American tradition.

816
01:16:20,336 --> 01:16:23,429
Good evening.
I'm Jess Perkins with Casey Wong.

817
01:16:23,464 --> 01:16:25,431
Top story: Santa Barbara.

818
01:16:25,466 --> 01:16:27,433
Ten thousand acres
of wooded residential land...

819
01:16:27,468 --> 01:16:30,436
...were scorched in an instant
when a laser canon...

820
01:16:30,471 --> 01:16:33,356
...aboard the Strategic Defense
Peace Platform...

821
01:16:33,391 --> 01:16:36,359
...misfired today
during routine tests.

822
01:16:36,394 --> 01:16:38,361
It was a day of mourning
for the families...

823
01:16:38,396 --> 01:16:41,239
...of 113 people known dead
at this hour.

824
01:16:41,274 --> 01:16:43,241
Among them, two former
U.S. presidents...

825
01:16:43,276 --> 01:16:46,369
...who had retired
in the Santa Barbara area.

826
01:16:46,404 --> 01:16:48,204
A day of mourning for a country.

827
01:16:48,239 --> 01:16:52,291
Police union representatives and OCP
continued negotiations today...

828
01:16:52,326 --> 01:16:56,462
...in hopes of averting
a citywide strike by police...

829
01:16:56,497 --> 01:16:59,382
...scheduled to begin
tomorrow at midnight.

830
01:16:59,417 --> 01:17:00,299
Justin Ballard-Watkins has more.

831
01:17:00,334 --> 01:17:03,386
They're still on duty.
But what about tomorrow?

832
01:17:03,421 --> 01:17:07,432
That's the question we put to people
in the crime-plagued Lexington area.

833
01:17:07,467 --> 01:17:10,351
They're public servants.
They got job security.

834
01:17:10,386 --> 01:17:12,437
They're not supposed to strike.

835
01:17:12,472 --> 01:17:14,480
It's a free society.

836
01:17:14,515 --> 01:17:18,484
Except there ain't nothing free,
because there's no guarantees.

837
01:17:18,519 --> 01:17:22,405
You're on your own.
That's the law of the jungle.

838
01:17:25,324 --> 01:17:29,370
- Be very careful.
- Excuse me, please.

839
01:17:30,371 --> 01:17:34,333
Remodeling.

840
01:17:37,336 --> 01:17:40,423
Hi, Barbara.

841
01:17:40,458 --> 01:17:43,342
Listen, I'm here to see Dick Jones.

842
01:17:43,377 --> 01:17:46,429
But when I'm done,
I've got some free time.

843
01:17:46,464 --> 01:17:50,349
Maybe you could fit me in.

844
01:17:51,350 --> 01:17:55,438
He's expecting you, Mr. Boddicker.

845
01:17:57,315 --> 01:18:01,444
You can keep the gum.

846
01:18:06,449 --> 01:18:09,452
Hey, Dickie-boy. How's tricks?

847
01:18:09,487 --> 01:18:11,454
That thing is still alive.

848
01:18:11,489 --> 01:18:13,456
What are you talking about?

849
01:18:13,491 --> 01:18:17,376
The police officer who arrested you,
the one you spilled your guts to.

850
01:18:18,169 --> 01:18:22,131
Take a look at my face, Dick.
He was trying to kill me.

851
01:18:24,133 --> 01:18:27,136
He's a cyborg, you idiot!

852
01:18:27,171 --> 01:18:30,139
He recorded every word you said.

853
01:18:30,174 --> 01:18:33,226
His memory's admissible as evidence!

854
01:18:33,261 --> 01:18:37,230
You involved me!

855
01:18:37,265 --> 01:18:41,275
You'll have to kill it.

856
01:18:42,318 --> 01:18:45,154
Well, listen, chief.

857
01:18:45,189 --> 01:18:49,242
Your company built the fucking thing.

858
01:18:49,277 --> 01:18:51,244
Now I gotta deal with it?

859
01:18:51,279 --> 01:18:54,247
I don't have time for this bullshit!

860
01:18:54,282 --> 01:18:58,167
Suit yourself. But Delta City
begins construction in two months.

861
01:18:58,202 --> 01:19:01,254
That's 2 million workers
living in trailers.

862
01:19:01,289 --> 01:19:05,174
That means drugs,
gambling, prostitution.

863
01:19:06,217 --> 01:19:10,096
Virgin territory for the man
who knows how to open up new markets.

864
01:19:10,131 --> 01:19:13,099
One man could control it all...

865
01:19:13,134 --> 01:19:16,185
...Clarence.

866
01:19:16,220 --> 01:19:20,273
Well, I guess we're gonna
be friends after all.

867
01:19:20,308 --> 01:19:24,152
Richard.

868
01:19:28,281 --> 01:19:31,242
Destroy it.

869
01:19:31,277 --> 01:19:35,288
Gonna need some major firepower.

870
01:19:36,330 --> 01:19:40,209
You got access to military weaponry?

871
01:19:40,244 --> 01:19:44,213
We practically are the military.

872
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:22,418
Did you bring the gun?

873
01:20:22,453 --> 01:20:26,339
The precinct was deserted. Half the
force didn't show up for work today.

874
01:20:26,374 --> 01:20:30,343
Everyone else walks out at midnight.
I guess we're on strike.

875
01:20:30,378 --> 01:20:32,261
I wasn't sure what you needed.

876
01:20:32,296 --> 01:20:36,265
I sort of grabbed things.

877
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:39,227
Your gun.

878
01:20:39,262 --> 01:20:43,189
You asked for this?

879
01:20:45,149 --> 01:20:48,111
I brought you some food.

880
01:20:48,146 --> 01:20:50,196
No, thank you.

881
01:20:50,231 --> 01:20:54,200
I'm not hungry.

882
01:21:14,345 --> 01:21:18,307
You may not like
what you're going to see.

883
01:21:52,341 --> 01:21:56,304
It's really good
to see you again, Murphy.

884
01:21:59,390 --> 01:22:03,352
Murphy had a wife and son.
Where are they?

885
01:22:04,395 --> 01:22:06,355
Well, after the funeral...

886
01:22:06,390 --> 01:22:10,276
...she moved away.
- Where did they go?

887
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:13,279
She thought you were dead.

888
01:22:13,314 --> 01:22:17,283
She started over again.

889
01:22:17,318 --> 01:22:21,287
I can feel them.

890
01:22:23,206 --> 01:22:27,293
But I can't remember them.

891
01:22:31,297 --> 01:22:35,218
Leave me alone.

892
01:23:20,430 --> 01:23:24,350
Happy birthday, Dave. She's from me.

893
01:23:25,351 --> 01:23:28,354
Well, hey, can I have you both?

894
01:23:28,389 --> 01:23:30,356
Sure!

895
01:23:30,391 --> 01:23:33,359
We've had our shots.

896
01:23:33,394 --> 01:23:37,405
I'd buy that for a dollar.

897
01:23:41,367 --> 01:23:44,287
Hey, Emil. How's the Gray Bar Hotel?

898
01:23:44,322 --> 01:23:48,458
Not bad. They let me keep the shirt.
And nobody popped my cherry.

899
01:23:48,493 --> 01:23:52,378
Emil, how you doing, man?
Good to see you.

900
01:23:52,413 --> 01:23:56,299
I get out of jail for free, then
I find this in the prison parking lot.

901
01:23:57,341 --> 01:24:01,387
A brand-new 6000 SUX.
Still got the factory sticker on it!

902
01:24:01,422 --> 01:24:03,306
Hey, Clarence!

903
01:24:03,341 --> 01:24:06,392
Joey's got a car just like yours, man!

904
01:24:06,427 --> 01:24:10,313
Clarence, what do you think, buddy?

905
01:24:15,401 --> 01:24:18,404
What do you got there, Clarence, huh?

906
01:24:18,439 --> 01:24:22,492
Whoa, a new toy. Can I play?

907
01:24:25,495 --> 01:24:26,537
Watch this.

908
01:24:26,572 --> 01:24:30,374
Wait a minute. Wait a minute!

909
01:24:31,417 --> 01:24:35,421
Aw, shit!

910
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:37,423
- Fuck!
- Nice car, Joe.

911
01:24:37,458 --> 01:24:39,342
- Fuck you, Clarence.
- Let me try that.

912
01:24:39,377 --> 01:24:43,429
Cobra assault canon.
State-of-the-art. Bang, bang.

913
01:24:50,436 --> 01:24:52,313
I like it!

914
01:24:52,348 --> 01:24:56,359
- Give it up, faggot little man.
- Get your own!

915
01:24:56,394 --> 01:25:00,446
Come on!

916
01:25:08,454 --> 01:25:12,458
Do it, Emil!

917
01:25:16,462 --> 01:25:20,383
Check this out!
Heads up, you guys!

918
01:25:28,307 --> 01:25:30,393
He's in the steel mill. Let's go.

919
01:25:30,428 --> 01:25:33,312
All right, cut the horseshit!
We're moving out.

920
01:25:33,347 --> 01:25:35,356
Come on, Emil!
Get your ass in the van.

921
01:25:35,391 --> 01:25:37,400
Come on, lard-ass! Let's move it!

922
01:25:37,435 --> 01:25:41,279
Forget you, faggot!

923
01:26:33,372 --> 01:26:36,459
What are you doing?

924
01:26:36,494 --> 01:26:40,546
My targeting system
is a little messed up.

925
01:26:42,465 --> 01:26:44,467
Can I help you?

926
01:26:44,502 --> 01:26:48,554
Aim for me.

927
01:26:57,438 --> 01:27:01,484
- Are you locked in now?
- Yes.

928
01:27:01,519 --> 01:27:03,319
A little more to the left.

929
01:27:03,354 --> 01:27:07,490
Here.

930
01:27:13,413 --> 01:27:17,500
- I figure that's dead-on.
- Thank you.

931
01:27:34,517 --> 01:27:38,438
Come on, man, let's smoke him!

932
01:27:38,473 --> 01:27:41,482
The wrecking crew is here!
Where is that mother...?

933
01:27:41,517 --> 01:27:44,444
Give that up, man!

934
01:27:44,479 --> 01:27:47,447
Nothing fancy. Just kill him. Emil!

935
01:27:47,482 --> 01:27:51,451
- What?
- In the van.

936
01:27:51,486 --> 01:27:55,538
- You should get out of here now.
- Hey, we're partners.

937
01:27:56,456 --> 01:28:00,460
Get the car.

938
01:28:34,577 --> 01:28:35,495
Damn it. Shit!

939
01:28:35,530 --> 01:28:39,415
Looking for me?

940
01:28:50,426 --> 01:28:51,385
Cut him off!

941
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:55,515
Come on! Go on! Cut him off! Go, go!

942
01:29:26,462 --> 01:29:30,466
Okay! Now I got you!

943
01:30:31,527 --> 01:30:33,613
Help me.

944
01:30:33,648 --> 01:30:37,658
Don't touch me, man!

945
01:30:37,693 --> 01:30:41,579
Help me.

946
01:30:57,637 --> 01:31:01,516
Shit!

947
01:31:26,499 --> 01:31:30,670
- Bye-bye, baby.
- Clarence!

948
01:31:55,611 --> 01:31:57,530
Okay.

949
01:31:57,565 --> 01:31:58,531
I give up.

950
01:31:58,566 --> 01:32:00,533
I'm not arresting you anymore.

951
01:32:00,568 --> 01:32:04,537
Hey. Now, wait a second.

952
01:32:09,542 --> 01:32:13,546
Wait a minute. You're taking
this kind of personal.

953
01:32:14,630 --> 01:32:15,631
Come on, man.

954
01:32:15,666 --> 01:32:19,552
You're making me nervous.
Come on, you can't do this.

955
01:32:19,587 --> 01:32:23,723
Come on now! Don't mess around!
Hey. Hey!

956
01:32:23,758 --> 01:32:27,643
Now, don't get cute!

957
01:32:30,646 --> 01:32:31,647
Die, you bastard!

958
01:32:31,682 --> 01:32:34,650
Yeah! Yeah!

959
01:32:34,685 --> 01:32:36,569
All right! All right!

960
01:32:36,604 --> 01:32:40,573
I got him, Clarence! I got him!

961
01:33:06,682 --> 01:33:10,686
Sayonara, Robocop!

962
01:33:23,616 --> 01:33:30,623
Lewis!

963
01:33:30,658 --> 01:33:34,627
Murphy, I'm a mess.

964
01:33:36,629 --> 01:33:38,631
They'll fix you.

965
01:33:38,666 --> 01:33:42,635
They fix everything.

966
01:33:50,643 --> 01:33:52,812
The police strike could work for us.

967
01:33:52,847 --> 01:33:55,732
We can have ED 209s
in place all over the city...

968
01:33:55,767 --> 01:33:57,734
...and expect immediate
public support.

969
01:33:57,769 --> 01:34:01,654
I've got one downstairs
guarding the building now.

970
01:34:08,578 --> 01:34:11,581
You're illegally parked
on private property.

971
01:34:11,616 --> 01:34:15,668
You have 20 seconds
to move your vehicle.

972
01:34:49,702 --> 01:34:51,704
Whatever happens...

973
01:34:51,739 --> 01:34:54,624
...this corporation will live up
to its guiding principles:

974
01:34:54,659 --> 01:34:58,628
Courage, strength, conviction.

975
01:35:01,631 --> 01:35:05,551
We will meet each new challenge
with the same aggressive attitude.

976
01:35:15,728 --> 01:35:17,730
How can we help you, officer?

977
01:35:17,765 --> 01:35:20,650
Dick Jones is wanted for murder.

978
01:35:20,685 --> 01:35:24,737
This is absurd! That thing is
a violent mechanical psychopath!

979
01:35:25,738 --> 01:35:29,742
My program will not allow me to act
against an officer of this company.

980
01:35:29,777 --> 01:35:33,663
These are serious charges.
What is your evidence?

981
01:35:43,673 --> 01:35:47,677
I had to kill Bob Morton
because he made a mistake.

982
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:51,681
Now it's time to erase that mistake.

983
01:35:51,716 --> 01:35:55,685
I had to kill Bob Morton
because he made a mistake.

984
01:35:55,720 --> 01:35:59,689
Now it's time to erase that mistake.

985
01:36:02,692 --> 01:36:04,694
I want a chopper! Now!

986
01:36:04,729 --> 01:36:07,697
We will walk to the roof very calmly.

987
01:36:07,732 --> 01:36:11,701
I will board the chopper
with my hostage.

988
01:36:12,702 --> 01:36:16,706
Anybody tries to stop me...

989
01:36:16,741 --> 01:36:20,793
...the old geezer gets it.

990
01:36:20,828 --> 01:36:24,797
Dick, you're fired!

991
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:28,801
Thank you.

992
01:36:51,824 --> 01:36:55,745
Nice shooting, son. What's your name?

993
01:36:56,746 --> 01:37:00,750
Murphy.
