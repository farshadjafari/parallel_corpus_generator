1
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,883
Yeah, I worked
in a barber shop,

2
00:01:55,008 --> 00:01:58,008
But I never considered
myself a barber.

3
00:01:58,133 --> 00:02:02,549
I stumbled into it well,
married into it, more precisely.

4
00:02:02,674 --> 00:02:06,633
It wasn't my establishment.
Like the fella says, I only work here.

5
00:02:09,966 --> 00:02:11,633
The dump was 200 feet square...

6
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:14,632
With three chairs,
or stations, as we call 'em,

7
00:02:14,924 --> 00:02:17,049
Even though there are only
two of us working.

8
00:02:17,175 --> 00:02:19,966
But this is my point.

9
00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:23,383
My point is that these traders and trappers
would come to this country,

10
00:02:23,507 --> 00:02:25,674
Get their pelts
and their gold "ignots"

11
00:02:25,966 --> 00:02:28,883
Frank Raffo, my brother-in-law,
was the principal barber.

12
00:02:28,966 --> 00:02:30,382
Man, could he talk.

13
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,050
Maybe if you're 11 or 12 years old,
Frank's got an interesting point of view,

14
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:38,590
But sometimes
it got on my nerves.

15
00:02:38,675 --> 00:02:40,466
Not that I complained,
mind you.

16
00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:43,007
Like I said, he was
the principal Barber.

17
00:02:44,007 --> 00:02:46,550
Frank's father August
they called him Guzzi

18
00:02:46,673 --> 00:02:49,299
Had worked the heads up
in Santa Rosa for 35 years...

19
00:02:49,424 --> 00:02:52,216
Until his ticker stopped
in the middle of a junior flattop.

20
00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:55,590
He left the shop to Frankie free and clear,

21
00:02:55,674 --> 00:02:58,299
And that seemed to satisfy
all of Frank's ambitions

22
00:02:58,382 --> 00:03:01,174
Cutting the hair
and chewing the fat.

23
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,048
Me, I don't talk much.

24
00:03:09,008 --> 00:03:10,882
I just cut the hair.

25
00:03:19,173 --> 00:03:22,133
It says here that the russians
exploded an a-bomb...

26
00:03:22,215 --> 00:03:25,132
And there's not a damn thing
we can do about it.

27
00:03:27,673 --> 00:03:29,673
How do you like them apples?

28
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:38,673
Being a barber is a lot like
being a bar man or a soda jerk.

29
00:03:38,965 --> 00:03:43,131
There's not much to it once
you've learned the basic moves.

30
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:45,214
For the kids, there's the butch,
or the heinie,

31
00:03:45,298 --> 00:03:47,257
The flattop, the ivy,

32
00:03:47,339 --> 00:03:49,132
The crew, the vanguard,

33
00:03:49,215 --> 00:03:50,631
The junior contour...

34
00:03:50,715 --> 00:03:54,173
And occasionally
the executive contour.

35
00:03:55,631 --> 00:03:59,381
lived in a little bungalow
on napa street.

36
00:03:59,465 --> 00:04:01,256
The place was okay, I guess.

37
00:04:01,339 --> 00:04:04,464
Had an electric icebox,
a gas hearth...

38
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,548
And a garbage grinde
built into the sink.

39
00:04:07,672 --> 00:04:10,006
You might say I had it made.

40
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:12,673
Oh, year,
there was one other thing.

41
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:16,922
Doris kept the books
at Nirdlingers,

42
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:19,381
A small department store
on main street.

43
00:04:19,464 --> 00:04:21,923
Doris liked the work,
accounting.

44
00:04:22,006 --> 00:04:24,589
She liked knowing
where everything stood

45
00:04:24,672 --> 00:04:28,505
And she got a ten percent employee
discount on whatever she wanted

46
00:04:28,631 --> 00:04:30,131
Nylon stockings,

47
00:04:30,255 --> 00:04:33,047
Makeup and perfume.

48
00:04:34,963 --> 00:04:37,630
Doris and I went to church
once a week.

49
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,088
Usually Tuesday night.

50
00:04:48,214 --> 00:04:51,089
Doris wasn't big
on divine worship,

51
00:04:51,172 --> 00:04:54,422
And I doubt if she believed
in life everlasting.

52
00:04:54,506 --> 00:04:57,464
She'd most likely tell you
that our reward is on this earth,

53
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,255
And bingo is probably
the extent of it.

54
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:01,963
B-7

55
00:05:02,047 --> 00:05:03,255
Watch you card,
honey.

56
00:05:03,338 --> 00:05:06,255
I wasn't crazy
about the game,

57
00:05:06,338 --> 00:05:08,422
But, I don't know,
it made her happy,

58
00:05:08,506 --> 00:05:11,629
And I found the setting
peaceful.

59
00:05:11,713 --> 00:05:13,130
Jesus. Bingo.

60
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:14,421
Bingo!

61
00:05:15,588 --> 00:05:18,213
Doris's boss,
Big Dave Brewster,

62
00:05:18,338 --> 00:05:22,255
Was married to Ann Nirdlinger,
the department store heiress.

63
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:24,546
Tonight they were coming over for dinner.

64
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,380
As Doris said,

65
00:05:26,504 --> 00:05:28,921
We were entertaining.

66
00:05:31,962 --> 00:05:34,129
Me, I don't like
entertaining.

67
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:39,213
- How you doin', Ed?
- Okay.

68
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:41,129
Take your coat, Ann?

69
00:05:41,212 --> 00:05:44,671
The japs had us pinned down
on Buna for somethin' like six weeks.

70
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,045
I gotta tell ya,
I thought we had it tough,
but we had supply.

71
00:05:48,171 --> 00:05:52,505
The japs were eatin' bugs
and grubs and thistles.

72
00:05:52,628 --> 00:05:55,463
Anyway, one day
we bust off the beach...

73
00:05:55,546 --> 00:05:59,587
And we find Arney Bragg,
this kid missin' on recon.

74
00:05:59,671 --> 00:06:02,420
the japs had eaten the son of a bitch.

75
00:06:02,504 --> 00:06:04,546
If you'll pardon the, uh...

76
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:08,420
Anyway, he was a scrawny, pimply kid,
nothin' to write home about.

77
00:06:08,503 --> 00:06:10,503
I mean, I never woulda,
you know.

78
00:06:13,046 --> 00:06:15,419
So, what do I say, honey?

79
00:06:15,504 --> 00:06:18,295
What do I say
when I don't like dinner?

80
00:06:18,421 --> 00:06:19,920
Come on.
what do I say?

81
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,504
I say,
"Arney Bragg, again?"

82
00:06:27,461 --> 00:06:29,378
Arney Bragg, again?

83
00:06:35,711 --> 00:06:38,545
- Were you in the service, Ed?
- No, Dave, I wasn't.

84
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:42,086
Ed was 4-f on account
of his fallen arches.

85
00:06:47,004 --> 00:06:48,253
That's tough.

86
00:06:48,336 --> 00:06:50,253
That's... That's tough.

87
00:06:55,462 --> 00:07:00,044
Yeah, I guess Doris liked
all that he-man stuff.

88
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,420
Sometimes I had the feeling that

89
00:07:02,503 --> 00:07:05,420
She and Big Dave were a lot closer
than they let on.

90
00:07:05,503 --> 00:07:08,127
The signs were all there,
plain enough.

91
00:07:18,211 --> 00:07:21,211
Not that I was gonna
prance about it, mind you.

92
00:07:21,336 --> 00:07:23,169
It's a free country.

93
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:26,336
Holdin' down the porch area, Ed?

94
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:30,502
- That's some wife you got there.
- Yeah.

95
00:07:31,503 --> 00:07:33,419
She's a rare one.

96
00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:37,295
So, how's business,
Dave?

97
00:07:37,627 --> 00:07:40,419
Oh, uh, couldn't be better.

98
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:43,461
These are boom times
in retailin', Ed.

99
00:07:43,502 --> 00:07:45,960
We're openin' another store
over there on carson,

100
00:07:46,044 --> 00:07:49,252
Big Dave's annex.
Now, this is strictly haberdashery.

101
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:52,460
It's casual wear, pajamas,
ladies' undergarments and foundations,

102
00:07:52,585 --> 00:07:54,336
That type of thing.

103
00:07:56,335 --> 00:08:00,377
As a matter of fact,
I'm thinkin' of makin' Doris the comptroller.

104
00:08:04,502 --> 00:08:06,919
Listen, when the annex opens up,
you gotta stop by.

105
00:08:07,002 --> 00:08:09,044
Maybe we can update your suit
a little bit, huh?

106
00:08:13,668 --> 00:08:16,126
Course, you're in
the smock all day.

107
00:08:18,251 --> 00:08:20,418
Where do you get those things,
anyway?

108
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:23,960
Specialty store
down in Sacramento.

109
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,667
You tie your own flies.

110
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,418
I mean, if you're really serious,
you tie your own flies.

111
00:08:40,501 --> 00:08:41,959
You do, uh...

112
00:08:42,042 --> 00:08:44,334
I know. It's meticulous.
I know.

113
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:47,084
People say, hey, you can
buy flies at the store.

114
00:08:47,167 --> 00:08:50,293
The point is, there's a certain art
to the process.

115
00:08:50,418 --> 00:08:52,876
The point is not merely to provide.

116
00:08:53,001 --> 00:08:57,377
Let me point out, these fish are not
as dumb as you might think.

117
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,501
Sure.
Go to the store.

118
00:08:59,626 --> 00:09:03,001
Describe to the man
where you will be fishing and for what,

119
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:08,042
And then you might as well have the man
sell you the goddamned fish, Ed.

120
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:09,293
My point is,

121
00:09:09,417 --> 00:09:12,459
This is a man who knows nothing,
no matter how much you tell him.

122
00:09:12,542 --> 00:09:15,334
- So sell him the goddamned fish, Ed.
- Yeah.

123
00:09:16,917 --> 00:09:17,958
Okay.

124
00:09:19,001 --> 00:09:20,959
Who gets the privilege?

125
00:09:21,042 --> 00:09:22,876
We're just closing, friend.

126
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,874
Oh, happy days.

127
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,875
I wish I was doing well enough
to turn away business.

128
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
What's the problem, friend?
this is a business establishment with posted hours.

129
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:34,792
More power to ya, brother.

130
00:09:34,917 --> 00:09:35,959
The public be damned.

131
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:36,958
Hey...

132
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:38,917
I'll take care of him.
you go ahead, Frank.

133
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Have a seat, mister.

134
00:09:41,124 --> 00:09:44,000
- You sure, Eddie?
- Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

135
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,250
In your ear, mister.

136
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:54,375
Oh, those fiery
Mediterraneans.

137
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:58,583
Uh, say, uh,
not so fast there, brother.

138
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,292
Pretty good, eh?

139
00:10:02,374 --> 00:10:04,290
Fools even the experts.

140
00:10:04,374 --> 00:10:07,874
One hundred percent human hair.
Handcrafted by Jacques

141
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,583
Of San Francisco.

142
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:12,874
I'd hate to have to tell you
what I paid for it.

143
00:10:12,999 --> 00:10:15,417
Yeah, it's a nice rug.

144
00:10:15,499 --> 00:10:17,415
I'm payin' it down
on the installment plan.

145
00:10:17,499 --> 00:10:21,457
A lot of folks live
with the pate exposed.

146
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,999
They say the dames
think it's sexy,

147
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:27,249
But for my money
it's just not good groomin'.

148
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:31,124
And groomin' my friend,
is probably the most important thing in business.

149
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,665
After personality, of course.

150
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:37,125
Creighton Tolliver.
Pleased to know ya.

151
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:39,624
Ed Crane.

152
00:10:40,624 --> 00:10:42,998
So, what brings you
to Santa Rosa?

153
00:10:43,124 --> 00:10:46,291
A goose, my friend.
I was chasin' a wild goose.

154
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,998
Ed, have you ever heard
of venture capital?

155
00:10:50,124 --> 00:10:52,583
Risk money.
very speculative.

156
00:10:52,665 --> 00:10:57,082
Except that in certain situations
it's not, see.

157
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:59,290
I thought I had
a prospect here

158
00:10:59,374 --> 00:11:03,998
Well, I make the haul up...
And this lousy so-and-so tells me...

159
00:11:04,124 --> 00:11:05,957
That the situation has changed.

160
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:09,582
All of his capital's tied up
in expansion plans of his own.

161
00:11:09,664 --> 00:11:12,415
Thank you mother.
Pop goes another bubble.

162
00:11:12,499 --> 00:11:15,374
It's only the biggest business opportunity
since Henry Ford,

163
00:11:15,498 --> 00:11:18,248
And I can't seem
to interest a soul.

164
00:11:18,332 --> 00:11:19,373
Is that right?

165
00:11:19,499 --> 00:11:21,457
It's called dry cleaning.

166
00:11:22,998 --> 00:11:25,623
You heard me right, brother.
dry cleaning.

167
00:11:25,707 --> 00:11:28,499
Wash without water.

168
00:11:28,623 --> 00:11:32,248
No suds. No tumple.
No stress on the clothes.

169
00:11:32,332 --> 00:11:35,123
It's all done
with chemicals, friend.

170
00:11:35,164 --> 00:11:36,956
And here's the capper...

171
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,373
No shrinkage.

172
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:41,123
That's right.

173
00:11:41,164 --> 00:11:42,457
Dry cleaning.

174
00:11:42,498 --> 00:11:45,664
All I need is $10,000
to open up the first store.

175
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:50,540
Then I use its cash flow
to finance another, and so on,

176
00:11:50,664 --> 00:11:53,998
Leapfrog, bootstrap myself
to a whole chain.

177
00:11:54,997 --> 00:11:56,498
Well, me and a partner.

178
00:11:58,164 --> 00:12:00,456
Cleanliness, friend.

179
00:12:00,581 --> 00:12:02,622
There's money in it.
there's a future.

180
00:12:02,706 --> 00:12:04,415
There's room to grow.

181
00:12:04,498 --> 00:12:07,663
Say, that looks pretty good.

182
00:12:07,956 --> 00:12:10,122
Let's see it
with the hairpiece on.

183
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:24,122
Dry cleaning.

184
00:12:25,664 --> 00:12:29,081
Was I crazy
to be thinking about it?

185
00:12:29,164 --> 00:12:33,621
Was he a huckster or an opportunity,
the real Mccoy?

186
00:12:37,038 --> 00:12:41,329
My first instinct was
no, no, the whole idea was nuts.

187
00:12:41,455 --> 00:12:45,205
But maybe that was the instinct
that kept me locked in the barber shop,

188
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:49,163
Nose against the exit
afraid to try turning the knob.

189
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,413
- Honey?
- Hmm?

190
00:12:52,913 --> 00:12:54,996
Shave my legs, will ya?

191
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,496
What if I could
get the money?

192
00:13:34,245 --> 00:13:36,454
It was clean.

193
00:13:37,121 --> 00:13:38,954
No water.

194
00:13:40,162 --> 00:13:41,953
Chemicals.

195
00:13:46,121 --> 00:13:47,954
Gimme a drag.

196
00:14:00,454 --> 00:14:02,120
Love ya, honey.

197
00:14:06,328 --> 00:14:07,954
What you...
uh, come in.

198
00:14:09,162 --> 00:14:12,245
Okay, yeah.
I'll see you tomorrow.

199
00:14:14,329 --> 00:14:16,120
Oh. I thought
you were the porter.

200
00:14:16,204 --> 00:14:18,203
Can I help ya?

201
00:14:18,328 --> 00:14:20,079
I'm Ed.

202
00:14:20,162 --> 00:14:22,161
Ed Crane.

203
00:14:24,454 --> 00:14:26,537
Um, I cut your hair today.

204
00:14:28,162 --> 00:14:29,412
I'm the barber.

205
00:14:29,495 --> 00:14:32,120
Jesus, yeah.
The barber.

206
00:14:32,202 --> 00:14:34,953
I didn't recognize you
without the smock.

207
00:14:35,078 --> 00:14:37,120
Did I leave somethin'
at the shop?

208
00:14:37,204 --> 00:14:39,619
No. No,
it's nothing like that.

209
00:14:39,703 --> 00:14:43,077
Um, l-I might be interested
in that business proposition.

210
00:14:46,244 --> 00:14:47,453
You got the dough?

211
00:14:47,494 --> 00:14:50,036
Well, I can get it.

212
00:14:50,161 --> 00:14:52,536
Come in. Come in!

213
00:14:52,662 --> 00:14:54,078
Sit down over there.

214
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:56,537
- Coffee?
- No.

215
00:14:56,661 --> 00:14:59,911
Well, sit down,
make yourself comfortable.

216
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,870
So tell me...

217
00:15:04,119 --> 00:15:08,660
Other than putting up the money, uh,
exactly what would you want the partner to, uh...

218
00:15:08,952 --> 00:15:10,453
Do?

219
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:12,119
Hell, nothin'.

220
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:16,453
You're gonna want to keep
tabs on your investment,
The running of the business,

221
00:15:16,536 --> 00:15:19,202
but I'm looking for a silent partner.

222
00:15:19,328 --> 00:15:22,369
I've done the research,
I've contacted the vendors.

223
00:15:22,493 --> 00:15:24,077
The deal is set.

224
00:15:24,161 --> 00:15:28,410
Disappear, if you'd like.
Check in whenever you want.

225
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:31,994
I want the dough.
I don't take attendance.

226
00:15:32,118 --> 00:15:33,619
And how do we share the...

227
00:15:33,702 --> 00:15:35,952
Fifty-fifty,
straight down the line.

228
00:15:36,077 --> 00:15:38,286
You and me.
Finance and expertise.

229
00:15:39,327 --> 00:15:41,285
So you got the dough then,
do ya?

230
00:15:41,369 --> 00:15:43,452
I can have it in a week.

231
00:15:43,577 --> 00:15:45,659
The barber...

232
00:15:47,161 --> 00:15:50,619
Well, I thought this trip
was gonna be a bust.

233
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,952
Just shows to go ya,
when one door slams shut,

234
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,952
Another one opens.

235
00:15:55,993 --> 00:15:58,327
Here's to you, uh...

236
00:16:28,034 --> 00:16:29,618
Was that a pass?

237
00:16:30,951 --> 00:16:32,368
Maybe.

238
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,118
Well, you're out of line, mister

239
00:16:37,034 --> 00:16:38,576
Not a problem.

240
00:16:38,659 --> 00:16:40,410
Way out of line.

241
00:16:40,493 --> 00:16:42,492
Right.

242
00:16:42,617 --> 00:16:44,408
Strictly business.

243
00:16:47,076 --> 00:16:48,493
Okay.

244
00:16:59,367 --> 00:17:02,118
I sent it to Dave
the next morning.

245
00:17:02,241 --> 00:17:03,950
Then I waited.

246
00:17:24,492 --> 00:17:26,867
- Frank?
- Huh?

247
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,575
This hair.

248
00:17:32,575 --> 00:17:34,408
Yeah?

249
00:17:34,491 --> 00:17:36,282
You ever wonder about it?

250
00:17:37,658 --> 00:17:39,158
What do you mean?

251
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:42,450
I don't know.

252
00:17:42,533 --> 00:17:44,991
How it keeps on coming.

253
00:17:46,408 --> 00:17:49,450
It just keeps growing.

254
00:17:49,533 --> 00:17:51,908
Yeah.
Lucky for us, huh, pal?

255
00:17:51,991 --> 00:17:53,117
No, I mean,

256
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:56,617
It keeps growing,

257
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:59,408
And it's part of us.

258
00:18:01,157 --> 00:18:03,949
And then we cut it off
and throw it away.

259
00:18:05,075 --> 00:18:07,990
Come on, Eddie.
You're gonna scare the kid.

260
00:18:16,199 --> 00:18:18,199
Okay, bud, you're through.

261
00:18:32,574 --> 00:18:35,490
I'm gonna take this hair
and throw it out in the dirt.

262
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,491
What?

263
00:18:39,407 --> 00:18:42,365
I'm gonna mingle it
with common house dirt.

264
00:18:45,115 --> 00:18:47,865
What the hell
are you talking about?

265
00:18:51,115 --> 00:18:52,907
I don't know.
Skip it.

266
00:19:02,656 --> 00:19:04,615
Ed, gimme a zip.

267
00:19:04,699 --> 00:19:07,198
Where you going?

268
00:19:07,323 --> 00:19:11,448
Us. The party at Nirdlingers.
I told you last week.

269
00:19:11,573 --> 00:19:15,115
The Christmas push.

270
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:17,948
Come on, get ready.

271
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,323
It's important.

272
00:19:19,447 --> 00:19:22,572
Nah, you go ahead.
I'm not big on parties.

273
00:19:22,656 --> 00:19:25,948
Oh, don't be a grump.
Gimme a zip.

274
00:19:55,364 --> 00:19:57,447
Hey, uh, ain't you
in ladies' wear?

275
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,988
Huh? Haven't I seen you
up in ladies' wear?

276
00:20:02,114 --> 00:20:04,281
I don't work here.
My wife does

277
00:20:05,697 --> 00:20:07,447
Uh-huh. Whew.
That's some beat, huh?

278
00:20:07,572 --> 00:20:09,114
Yeah.
Lucky for us, huh, pal?

279
00:20:09,197 --> 00:20:12,155
Check out the rack
on that broad in the angora.

280
00:20:13,156 --> 00:20:15,280
Ed, can I talk to you?

281
00:20:15,364 --> 00:20:16,446
Sure.

282
00:20:19,197 --> 00:20:20,280
Come in.

283
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:26,197
Oh, sit down.

284
00:20:28,989 --> 00:20:31,322
Souvenired it off a jap
in New Guinea.

285
00:20:34,697 --> 00:20:38,655
Guess you're, uh, wonderin'
what Doris was so hot about.

286
00:20:44,196 --> 00:20:45,446
Havanas.

287
00:20:46,322 --> 00:20:48,280
My private stock.

288
00:20:49,696 --> 00:20:51,571
Romeo and Juliet.

289
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:12,071
Ed, I...

290
00:21:16,695 --> 00:21:19,154
What is it, Dave?

291
00:21:23,488 --> 00:21:24,946
Ed, I've been weak.

292
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,612
I've been weak.
The, uh...

293
00:21:29,696 --> 00:21:31,946
You're gonna burn yourself.

294
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:36,279
Thanks.

295
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:37,612
l, uh...

296
00:21:40,654 --> 00:21:42,195
Oh, Jesus.

297
00:21:45,946 --> 00:21:47,944
I've been carryin' on
with a married woman.

298
00:21:50,154 --> 00:21:52,278
No one you know.

299
00:21:52,404 --> 00:21:54,903
And now the, uh,

300
00:21:55,028 --> 00:21:57,361
The chickens are
comin' home to roost.

301
00:21:58,154 --> 00:22:00,070
I got a note.

302
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:02,154
A blackmail note, you know.

303
00:22:02,236 --> 00:22:04,403
Come across,
or everybody knows.

304
00:22:06,695 --> 00:22:09,445
I guess you know
what that would do to me.

305
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,986
I guess that would be
pretty awkward.

306
00:22:15,112 --> 00:22:16,653
Awkward?

307
00:22:16,944 --> 00:22:19,570
Yeah. Yeah.

308
00:22:19,652 --> 00:22:22,986
Ann would throw me
right out on my keister.

309
00:22:23,111 --> 00:22:26,277
I mean, it's her st...
It's her family's store, Ed.
It's her store.

310
00:22:26,362 --> 00:22:29,945
I serve at the indulgence
of the goddamn ownership.

311
00:22:31,653 --> 00:22:33,569
The lady's husband
would know.

312
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:41,528
- How much do they want, Dave?
- Ten thousand dollars.

313
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:44,611
I don't know what to do, Ed.
I don't know what I can do.

314
00:22:46,111 --> 00:22:48,277
You know,

315
00:22:48,402 --> 00:22:50,652
I know who
the son of a bitch is.

316
00:22:53,694 --> 00:22:56,443
You know... who who is?

317
00:22:56,528 --> 00:22:58,111
The son of a bitch.
The blackmailer.

318
00:22:58,237 --> 00:23:00,153
I know who he is.

319
00:23:00,235 --> 00:23:03,194
It's no one you know.
It's a businessman from Sacramento.

320
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:05,277
A goddamn pansy, Ed.

321
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:10,651
Tryin' to rope me
into some crackpot scheme.

322
00:23:10,944 --> 00:23:13,610
I heard him out,
then I told him to go to hell.

323
00:23:13,694 --> 00:23:17,153
The very next day
the very next day I get a note,
the blackmail note,

324
00:23:17,194 --> 00:23:19,610
Asking me for the same amout of money
he asked me for.

325
00:23:19,694 --> 00:23:21,943
The very next day.
Ten thousand dollars.

326
00:23:25,443 --> 00:23:27,360
How did he know that
you were seein' the woman?

327
00:23:27,485 --> 00:23:30,485
He stayed at the hotel
that I went to with the, uh,

328
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:33,943
lady in question.
He must've seen us.

329
00:23:35,235 --> 00:23:36,652
Oh, Jesus.

330
00:23:37,694 --> 00:23:41,152
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.

331
00:23:49,318 --> 00:23:51,276
I don't know what to do.

332
00:24:03,944 --> 00:24:05,609
Why don't you just pay him. Dave?

333
00:24:05,693 --> 00:24:08,275
Cause that's my capitalization
on the annex.

334
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:10,609
That's my operation.

335
00:24:12,609 --> 00:24:14,318
Christ almighty, Ed.

336
00:24:15,484 --> 00:24:18,442
That's what I just talkin'
to Doris about down there

337
00:24:18,526 --> 00:24:21,108
A way to get the money from the store
that we could hide from Ann.

338
00:24:22,984 --> 00:24:26,359
Doris, she was, she was pretty hot
about that, god bless her.

339
00:24:26,484 --> 00:24:29,150
Embezzlin', Ed.

340
00:24:29,276 --> 00:24:32,234
Embezzlin' from
my own goddamn wife.

341
00:24:37,317 --> 00:24:38,900
I'm sorry.

342
00:24:41,442 --> 00:24:43,108
I'm sorry.

343
00:24:44,443 --> 00:24:46,275
It's okay.

344
00:24:57,651 --> 00:25:00,567
In a way,
I felt bad for Big Dave.

345
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:04,900
I knew that ten grand was going to
pinch him where it hurt,

346
00:25:04,984 --> 00:25:06,859
But Doris was two-timing me

347
00:25:06,984 --> 00:25:09,942
And I guess somewhere
that pinched a little too.

348
00:26:04,358 --> 00:26:06,066
That was pretty.

349
00:26:08,523 --> 00:26:10,191
Did you make that up?

350
00:26:10,316 --> 00:26:12,274
Oh, no.

351
00:26:12,399 --> 00:26:15,065
No, that was written
by Ludwig Van Beethoven.

352
00:26:20,399 --> 00:26:22,649
Well, it was quite something.

353
00:26:22,898 --> 00:26:25,399
Yeah, he wrote some
beautiful piano sonatas.

354
00:26:25,482 --> 00:26:28,482
That was really something.

355
00:26:33,482 --> 00:26:34,940
I'm Ed Crane.

356
00:26:35,024 --> 00:26:36,941
I know who you are, Mr. Crane.

357
00:26:37,024 --> 00:26:40,357
My father used to take me with him
when he went to get his hair cut.

358
00:26:40,482 --> 00:26:41,648
Walter Abundas?

359
00:26:41,898 --> 00:26:44,316
Oh, yeah, sure.
Walter.

360
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,440
Yeah, I'm Rachel Abundas.

361
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,522
But everyone call me Birdy.

362
00:26:50,689 --> 00:26:52,939
I'm sorry.
I just didn't remember.

363
00:26:53,023 --> 00:26:54,148
Oh, no, it's okay.

364
00:26:54,273 --> 00:26:59,189
You can't expect to remember
every skinny girl who comes in with her dad.

365
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:09,273
So you don't, uh, like
that music out there?

366
00:27:09,398 --> 00:27:11,939
Not really.

367
00:27:12,064 --> 00:27:14,190
I'm not big on music, ordinarily.

368
00:27:15,231 --> 00:27:16,440
Ed.

369
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,148
What a knucklehead.

370
00:27:31,982 --> 00:27:34,148
- Who?
- Dave.

371
00:27:35,564 --> 00:27:37,273
Why's that?

372
00:27:38,064 --> 00:27:39,523
Money problems.

373
00:27:39,647 --> 00:27:42,438
He's thinking about
canceling the annex.

374
00:27:43,313 --> 00:27:44,606
So?

375
00:27:45,647 --> 00:27:48,439
That means I don't run Nirdlingers.

376
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:55,564
What a knucklehead.

377
00:28:01,396 --> 00:28:03,522
Big Dave did it, though.

378
00:28:09,064 --> 00:28:12,106
I sent a note telling him
where to drop the money.

379
00:28:14,105 --> 00:28:15,272
And he did.

380
00:28:15,355 --> 00:28:17,064
He came across.

381
00:28:56,062 --> 00:28:58,063
Yeah. Good!
How are ya?

382
00:28:58,146 --> 00:29:00,437
Come in.
I got everything organized.

383
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,228
How you doin'?
You got a check?

384
00:29:03,312 --> 00:29:06,313
- Cash.
- Cash?

385
00:29:06,395 --> 00:29:09,271
Usually these kinds of things
are done with a bank draft,

386
00:29:09,396 --> 00:29:11,521
But cash, that's fine.

387
00:29:11,646 --> 00:29:13,646
It's all the same in the end.

388
00:29:15,312 --> 00:29:16,646
Dough is dough, huh?

389
00:29:18,478 --> 00:29:19,478
Whoa, nellie.

390
00:29:22,396 --> 00:29:24,228
I got the paperwork here.

391
00:29:24,313 --> 00:29:26,187
Partnership papers.

392
00:29:26,271 --> 00:29:28,020
They reflect our agreement.

393
00:29:28,145 --> 00:29:30,061
Fifty-fifty on the net.

394
00:29:30,146 --> 00:29:34,978
I provide professional services,
you provide the capital.

395
00:29:35,062 --> 00:29:38,478
I'm gonna give you a receipt
on the dough here.

396
00:29:38,603 --> 00:29:40,979
Uh, pretty straightforward.

397
00:29:41,062 --> 00:29:43,978
- I don't know whether you wanna show it to a lawyer
- No, that's okay.

398
00:29:44,062 --> 00:29:46,853
Yeah. Screw 'em, right?

399
00:29:46,978 --> 00:29:50,394
Pay them to tangle it up,
then you have to pay them to untangle them.

400
00:29:50,478 --> 00:29:52,478
What's the point?

401
00:29:52,562 --> 00:29:54,479
You just give me a second,

402
00:29:54,562 --> 00:29:57,270
I'll give you a receipt on the...

403
00:29:57,979 --> 00:29:59,103
Whoa, nellie.

404
00:30:00,478 --> 00:30:03,853
Okay, one thing
we didn't talk about was,

405
00:30:03,936 --> 00:30:06,853
I am thinking about,
uh, calling the place Tolliver's.

406
00:30:06,978 --> 00:30:08,602
After me, you know.

407
00:30:08,895 --> 00:30:12,894
I didn't think you were, uh,
much interested in, uh...

408
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:16,436
- That's fine.
- Yeah, that's good. Good, good.

409
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:20,019
Now, ready?
One second and I will...

410
00:30:20,145 --> 00:30:22,644
Okay, that's it.

411
00:30:24,394 --> 00:30:26,394
As per our discussion.

412
00:30:27,436 --> 00:30:29,144
All right, there it is,

413
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:32,353
Writ large in legal escritoire.

414
00:30:32,478 --> 00:30:34,269
- And the, uh...
- Say, Creighton.

415
00:30:38,144 --> 00:30:40,019
You're not gonna screw me
on this.

416
00:30:42,019 --> 00:30:43,435
Screw you?

417
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:44,894
Jesus.

418
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:47,643
Take it to a lawyer.

419
00:30:47,936 --> 00:30:50,269
No, I insist!

420
00:30:50,352 --> 00:30:52,186
I insist!

421
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:56,436
This is dry cleaning.
This is not some fly-by-night thing here.

422
00:30:57,685 --> 00:30:59,186
Oh, I'll tell you,

423
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:03,101
I have been 13 years as an entrepreneur,
and I have never...

424
00:31:03,227 --> 00:31:04,518
- It's okay.
- Nobody's ever questioned me...

425
00:31:04,643 --> 00:31:06,976
Hey, you want the dough back?

426
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,144
Huh? Huh? Do you know
who you're talkin' to here?

427
00:31:09,227 --> 00:31:11,519
Do you know who I am?
Do you have any idea who...

428
00:31:11,602 --> 00:31:12,935
It's okay.

429
00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:16,977
So, Tolliver's is okay, then?

430
00:31:20,643 --> 00:31:22,518
The next day was Saturday.

431
00:31:22,644 --> 00:31:25,436
We were going to a reception
for Doris's cousin Gina...

432
00:31:25,518 --> 00:31:28,561
Who just married a wop vendor
out near Modesto.

433
00:31:28,684 --> 00:31:31,185
Doris didn't much feel like going,
and I didn't either.

434
00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:35,435
But like she said,
we had a commitment.

435
00:31:37,476 --> 00:31:39,268
I hate wops.

436
00:31:42,643 --> 00:31:45,143
What's so goddamn strange
about that?

437
00:31:45,226 --> 00:31:46,602
I didn't say a word.

438
00:31:46,685 --> 00:31:48,893
You didn't have to
grow up with them.

439
00:31:50,935 --> 00:31:52,226
Family.

440
00:31:59,558 --> 00:32:02,184
Ed! Uncle Ed!

441
00:32:06,892 --> 00:32:10,517
He's riding Garibaldi!
Uncle Frankie's riding Garibaldi!

442
00:32:33,183 --> 00:32:35,267
That was when
she started drinking.

443
00:32:35,392 --> 00:32:36,184
Doris.

444
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:37,933
Doris!

445
00:32:38,017 --> 00:32:40,059
You been okay?

446
00:32:40,141 --> 00:32:43,308
Mmm. Yeah.
How you doing, Costanza?

447
00:32:43,434 --> 00:32:46,642
Oh, you know.
Still got my health.

448
00:32:46,934 --> 00:32:49,100
And. Uh, how you been, uh...

449
00:32:50,267 --> 00:32:51,642
- Ed.
- Ed.

450
00:32:51,933 --> 00:32:54,350
He's a barber, right?

451
00:32:54,475 --> 00:32:58,099
It's a good trade.
So, how come you got no kids, huh?

452
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:00,517
No, come on, kids!

453
00:33:00,601 --> 00:33:04,850
l-I just ate lunch!
I couldn't eat another thing.

454
00:33:04,932 --> 00:33:06,975
Oh, n... Anthony!

455
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,475
Anthony, it's you!

456
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:11,600
Okay, kids. Ready? And...

457
00:33:21,308 --> 00:33:25,516
Congratulations. Gina.
It's so goddamn wonderful.

458
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:29,142
Life is just so goddamn wonderful,
You almost won't believe it.

459
00:33:29,265 --> 00:33:31,224
- It's just a bowl of goddamn cherries.
- Let' go.

460
00:33:31,308 --> 00:33:33,266
Sure.

461
00:33:36,182 --> 00:33:38,850
Congratulations on your goddamn cherries!

462
00:33:41,141 --> 00:33:42,932
Let go of my goddamn elbow!

463
00:33:54,891 --> 00:33:58,058
I never wanna see
another blueberry pie.

464
00:34:01,348 --> 00:34:04,599
I never even wanna hear those words.

465
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:10,099
Don't say those words, Ed.

466
00:34:12,433 --> 00:34:14,432
Don't say those words.

467
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:05,972
I'd met Doris blind
on a double date...

468
00:35:06,098 --> 00:35:09,639
With a loudmouthed buddy of mine
who was seeing a friend of hers from work.

469
00:35:09,931 --> 00:35:13,848
We went to a movie.
Doris had a flask.

470
00:35:13,973 --> 00:35:16,139
Boy, she could put it away.

471
00:35:19,556 --> 00:35:23,973
At the end of the night,
she said she liked that I didn't talk much.

472
00:35:24,097 --> 00:35:27,138
It was only a couple weeks later
she suggested we get married.

473
00:35:36,264 --> 00:35:37,556
Yeah.

474
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:41,555
Ed, it's Big Dave.
I gotta talk to you.

475
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,180
What?

476
00:35:44,014 --> 00:35:45,388
Now?

477
00:35:46,305 --> 00:35:48,513
Yeah. It's important.

478
00:35:49,305 --> 00:35:51,098
But it-it's...

479
00:35:51,221 --> 00:35:53,096
Please, Ed.

480
00:35:54,514 --> 00:35:56,347
Your place?

481
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:58,388
I'm at the store.

482
00:35:58,513 --> 00:36:00,846
Let yourself in.

483
00:36:57,429 --> 00:36:58,596
Dave?

484
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:04,513
I'm ruined.

485
00:37:08,304 --> 00:37:10,428
They've ruined me.

486
00:37:10,512 --> 00:37:12,386
This money.

487
00:37:13,553 --> 00:37:15,178
No annex.

488
00:37:16,138 --> 00:37:18,136
I'm all shot to hell.

489
00:37:20,094 --> 00:37:22,095
So, you paid the guy?

490
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:34,428
What kind of man are you?

491
00:37:37,178 --> 00:37:39,304
What kind of man...

492
00:37:39,428 --> 00:37:40,887
Are you?

493
00:37:44,261 --> 00:37:47,345
I mean, I'd understand
if you came in here and...

494
00:37:47,471 --> 00:37:49,970
Socked me in the nose, whatever.

495
00:37:51,094 --> 00:37:52,928
I deserve it.

496
00:37:53,053 --> 00:37:55,594
I'm not proud of what I did.

497
00:37:57,136 --> 00:37:58,969
But you.

498
00:38:03,095 --> 00:38:04,428
Yeah, I paid up.

499
00:38:06,011 --> 00:38:07,886
As you well know.

500
00:38:09,677 --> 00:38:12,094
But then I went and
found the pansy.

501
00:38:18,345 --> 00:38:20,511
Oh, you got nothin' to say, huh?

502
00:38:20,636 --> 00:38:23,594
Well, you know the story.

503
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:27,385
I didn't.

504
00:38:27,469 --> 00:38:30,094
I had to beat it
out of the pansy.

505
00:39:01,052 --> 00:39:02,926
I'm all shot to hell.

506
00:39:09,926 --> 00:39:11,635
Well, Dave, uh...

507
00:42:21,631 --> 00:42:25,424
It was only a couple weeks later
she suggested we get married.

508
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:32,131
I said, "Don't you want
to get to know me more?"

509
00:42:32,257 --> 00:42:35,006
She said, "Why?
Does it get better?"

510
00:42:37,256 --> 00:42:39,173
She looked at me
like I was a dope,

511
00:42:39,298 --> 00:42:41,923
Which I never
really minded from her.

512
00:42:42,006 --> 00:42:44,923
And she had a point,
I guess.

513
00:42:45,006 --> 00:42:48,255
We knew each other
as well then as now.

514
00:42:48,297 --> 00:42:50,840
Anyway, well enough.

515
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:07,131
Holy, moley,
do I got a headache.

516
00:43:07,255 --> 00:43:09,922
- How are you today, Ed?
- Okay.

517
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,880
- You don't got a headache?
- No.

518
00:43:15,047 --> 00:43:18,214
Damn, I got a headache
to beat the band.

519
00:43:22,505 --> 00:43:26,048
Did you pump it? You can't pump it.
That'll just flood it.

520
00:43:26,131 --> 00:43:31,005
No, no, no, you gotta pump it.
You can't just hold it down.
I mean that'll flood it.

521
00:43:31,131 --> 00:43:33,505
You crazy?
You pump it.

522
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:35,963
You can't hold it down.

523
00:43:37,297 --> 00:43:40,255
- Just turn the key.
- Not when it's cold.

524
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:42,380
Well, if it's cold, choke it.

525
00:43:42,505 --> 00:43:44,046
And pump it.

526
00:43:44,172 --> 00:43:45,546
How many time?

527
00:43:49,504 --> 00:43:51,338
Ed Crane?

528
00:43:54,964 --> 00:43:56,880
I'm Crane.

529
00:43:56,963 --> 00:43:59,505
- Come on outside.
- Sure.

530
00:44:15,379 --> 00:44:18,213
I'm officer Persky.
This is Krebs.

531
00:44:20,129 --> 00:44:21,920
Well, we goin'?

532
00:44:27,171 --> 00:44:28,212
Cigarette?

533
00:44:31,962 --> 00:44:33,087
Right.

534
00:44:35,088 --> 00:44:37,421
Pete's got some news for ya.

535
00:44:43,254 --> 00:44:44,628
Look, pal, um,

536
00:44:46,546 --> 00:44:48,421
It's a tough break, but, um,

537
00:44:50,212 --> 00:44:52,003
Well, damn it,
your wife's been pinched.

538
00:44:52,129 --> 00:44:55,087
They sent us around
to tell you.

539
00:44:56,962 --> 00:44:59,587
They sent us around to tell you.
We pulled the detail.

540
00:45:01,503 --> 00:45:03,837
My wife?

541
00:45:03,961 --> 00:45:07,253
Yeah, they brung her down
to county jail.

542
00:45:08,336 --> 00:45:09,545
Homicide.

543
00:45:09,629 --> 00:45:11,462
Well, embezzlement...

544
00:45:11,587 --> 00:45:13,171
And homicide.

545
00:45:13,295 --> 00:45:16,837
Guy named David Brewster.
He's the guy she...

546
00:45:16,962 --> 00:45:18,462
H-He's the decedent.

547
00:45:19,211 --> 00:45:20,879
I don't understand.

548
00:45:20,962 --> 00:45:22,462
He's the dead guy.

549
00:45:22,587 --> 00:45:26,337
Yeah, it's a tough break.

550
00:45:27,961 --> 00:45:30,129
Visiting ends at 5:00.

551
00:45:30,252 --> 00:45:32,420
Oh, uh, missed it today,
but, uh,

552
00:45:33,419 --> 00:45:35,212
You can go see her tomorrow.

553
00:45:36,962 --> 00:45:38,586
Sorry, pal.

554
00:45:38,628 --> 00:45:40,961
They sent us to tell ya.

555
00:45:42,795 --> 00:45:44,586
Crab detail.

556
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:11,002
- Hello, Walter.
- Hello, Ed.

557
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:16,961
Thanks.
Thanks for seein' me at home.

558
00:46:17,086 --> 00:46:19,878
Oh, hell.
Want a drink?

559
00:46:21,877 --> 00:46:22,877
Uh, no, thanks.

560
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,210
You sure you don't need one?

561
00:46:25,293 --> 00:46:27,168
I'm fine.

562
00:46:28,335 --> 00:46:30,419
- Boy.
- Yeah.

563
00:46:31,918 --> 00:46:33,377
Jesus.

564
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:38,252
So, uh,
What do l, uh...

565
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:40,835
Of course, uh, l, uh...

566
00:46:41,585 --> 00:46:44,086
It's out of my league.

567
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:48,543
No, I... no, l-I do probate
and real estate...

568
00:46:48,627 --> 00:46:49,918
And title search.

569
00:46:51,377 --> 00:46:55,084
I'd be absolutely worthless,
somethin' like this. Absolutely worthless.

570
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:58,835
Excuse me.

571
00:47:00,376 --> 00:47:02,376
I just finished dinner.

572
00:47:06,125 --> 00:47:09,625
Frankly, Doris'd be better off
with the county defender.

573
00:47:09,918 --> 00:47:12,835
- He a good man?
- Bert's okay.

574
00:47:12,959 --> 00:47:15,584
Yeah, he...
he's a good man.

575
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:20,210
Listen. I won't kid you, Ed.

576
00:47:20,293 --> 00:47:24,084
Uh, there's nobody around here
has any experience with this kind of thing.

577
00:47:25,293 --> 00:47:27,584
I hear they're bringing a prosecutor up.

578
00:47:27,626 --> 00:47:29,627
From, uh, Sacramento.

579
00:47:31,459 --> 00:47:35,125
It's a capital offense.
They're taking it seriously.

580
00:47:35,251 --> 00:47:37,209
- So...
- They're taking it seriously.

581
00:47:37,292 --> 00:47:39,626
So, what-what, uh...

582
00:47:39,917 --> 00:47:42,376
Do you want any more coffee, dad?
Oh, hi, Mr. Crane.

583
00:47:43,459 --> 00:47:45,000
Hello, Rachel.

584
00:47:47,334 --> 00:47:49,250
I was so sorry to hear.

585
00:47:50,959 --> 00:47:52,251
Yeah, thanks.

586
00:47:52,375 --> 00:47:54,584
- Coffee, Ed?
- No, thanks.

587
00:47:54,625 --> 00:47:57,376
- Ah, no, thanks, honey. We're...
- Okay, dad.

588
00:47:57,459 --> 00:47:59,542
It was good to see you again,
Mr. Crane.

589
00:48:03,668 --> 00:48:05,084
Damn.

590
00:48:06,334 --> 00:48:07,584
A good kid.

591
00:48:07,624 --> 00:48:09,126
Jesus...

592
00:48:14,334 --> 00:48:18,083
Who do you think?

593
00:48:18,125 --> 00:48:20,583
Lloyd Garroway in San Francisco.

594
00:48:21,291 --> 00:48:22,875
Probity.

595
00:48:22,959 --> 00:48:27,625
You know, nobody ever said anything iffy
about Lloyd Garroway.

596
00:48:28,625 --> 00:48:30,583
He's conservative.

597
00:48:30,875 --> 00:48:33,834
Jury might like that.
Might like that here.

598
00:48:36,125 --> 00:48:37,208
Probity.

599
00:48:37,292 --> 00:48:41,124
So, he's, uh,
the best man for...

600
00:48:41,249 --> 00:48:42,499
No.

601
00:48:42,625 --> 00:48:46,374
The best, the money-is-no-object best,

602
00:48:46,458 --> 00:48:50,041
any lawyer'll tell you,
is Freddy Riedenschneider from...

603
00:48:52,583 --> 00:48:54,208
Sacramento.

604
00:48:55,541 --> 00:48:58,249
I don't know
how you're fixed for money.

605
00:48:58,374 --> 00:49:00,249
- But he's...
- The best.

606
00:49:00,374 --> 00:49:01,833
The best, yeah.

607
00:49:04,458 --> 00:49:06,416
Riedenschneider.

608
00:49:15,457 --> 00:49:17,291
No question about it.

609
00:49:46,956 --> 00:49:48,083
Honey.

610
00:50:05,124 --> 00:50:06,999
I brought your makeup.

611
00:50:08,915 --> 00:50:10,082
Glasses.

612
00:50:17,248 --> 00:50:19,123
What happened to you?

613
00:50:19,248 --> 00:50:21,539
I don't know
what's goin' on... I...

614
00:50:25,123 --> 00:50:26,998
I don't know
what happened to Big Dave.

615
00:50:27,123 --> 00:50:28,915
I know some of it.

616
00:50:28,998 --> 00:50:32,248
Irregullarities in the books, they said.
Can I explain it?

617
00:50:33,414 --> 00:50:35,539
You don't have to
explain anything.

618
00:50:35,623 --> 00:50:38,539
I did help him cook the books, Ed.
I did do that.

619
00:50:45,372 --> 00:50:46,539
Should I...

620
00:50:48,331 --> 00:50:51,997
Should I tell you
why I changed the books?

621
00:50:55,289 --> 00:50:57,955
You don't have to
tell me anything.

622
00:50:59,372 --> 00:51:01,205
No, no, no!

623
00:51:02,538 --> 00:51:03,913
Jesus Christ!

624
00:51:18,872 --> 00:51:20,579
My books used to be perfect.

625
00:51:20,664 --> 00:51:24,205
Anyone could open 'em up
and make sense of the whole goddamn store.

626
00:51:28,872 --> 00:51:30,830
I knew we'd pay for it.

627
00:51:30,913 --> 00:51:32,497
I don't care what it costs!

628
00:51:32,621 --> 00:51:35,955
This is when you come together.

629
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,579
Well, that's awfully
generous of you, Frank.

630
00:51:37,872 --> 00:51:40,871
The hell with it.
The hell with it, Eddie.

631
00:51:40,997 --> 00:51:42,914
This is when you come together.

632
00:51:42,996 --> 00:51:44,912
This is family.

633
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:51,579
They're just people
like you and me, Ed.

634
00:51:51,871 --> 00:51:53,371
Remember that.

635
00:51:54,955 --> 00:51:56,913
Just people.

636
00:51:56,996 --> 00:52:01,371
They gotta put up the big front
so that people will trust 'em with their money.

637
00:52:01,455 --> 00:52:03,913
This is why the big lobby, Ed.

638
00:52:03,996 --> 00:52:08,830
But they put their pants on
one leg at a time just like you and me.

639
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:14,163
They, too, use the toilet, Ed,
in spite of appearances.

640
00:52:14,287 --> 00:52:17,329
And their money will be secured
by the barber shop.

641
00:52:17,454 --> 00:52:20,413
A rock.
A rock, the barber shop.

642
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:22,330
Mr. Raffo.

643
00:52:22,453 --> 00:52:24,121
Yes, sir?

644
00:52:24,246 --> 00:52:26,205
Could you come with me,
please?

645
00:52:26,329 --> 00:52:28,454
Sure.
Can Ed come too?

646
00:52:28,578 --> 00:52:30,038
Mister...

647
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:33,538
Crane.
Ed Crane.

648
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:36,496
You also have an interest
in the securing porperty?

649
00:52:37,954 --> 00:52:39,579
He's a barber.

650
00:52:39,663 --> 00:52:43,204
- Second chair.
- Not an owner.

651
00:52:43,329 --> 00:52:47,287
No, he's, uh, family.
He's my brother-in-law.

652
00:52:47,371 --> 00:52:50,579
It would be best
if he waited here.

653
00:53:28,494 --> 00:53:30,328
The barber shop.

654
00:53:34,328 --> 00:53:38,327
Doris and Frank's father had worked
30 years to own it free and clear.

655
00:53:38,453 --> 00:53:42,452
Now it got signed over to the bank,
and the bank signed some over to Frank.

656
00:53:42,578 --> 00:53:45,994
And Frank signed the money
to Freddy Riedenschneider.

657
00:53:46,119 --> 00:53:48,244
Who got into town
two days later...

658
00:53:48,327 --> 00:53:51,203
And told me to meet him
at Da Vinci's for lunch.

659
00:53:53,911 --> 00:53:56,411
Not fried, poached.
Three of 'em for two minutes.

660
00:53:56,535 --> 00:53:59,535
Strip steak, medium rare,
flapjacks, potatoes, tomato juice...

661
00:53:59,619 --> 00:54:00,952
And plenty of hot coffee.

662
00:54:01,994 --> 00:54:04,577
- You have any Prairie Oysters?
- No, sir.

663
00:54:04,661 --> 00:54:07,828
Then bring me a fruit cocktail
while I wait.

664
00:54:10,243 --> 00:54:12,244
- You're Crane?
- Yeah.

665
00:54:12,369 --> 00:54:13,910
Barber, right?

666
00:54:14,036 --> 00:54:15,911
I'm Freddy Riedenschneider.
Hungry?

667
00:54:15,994 --> 00:54:17,243
Uh, not really.

668
00:54:17,327 --> 00:54:20,160
They tell me the chow's okay here.
I made some inquiries.

669
00:54:21,618 --> 00:54:24,743
Look, I don't want to waste your time,
so I'll eat while we talk.

670
00:54:24,869 --> 00:54:25,993
Do you mind?
You don't mind.

671
00:54:26,077 --> 00:54:28,951
While I'm in town
I'm staying at the Hotel Metropole.

672
00:54:29,036 --> 00:54:33,036
Turandot Suite. Yeah, it's goofy.
They named their suites after operas.

673
00:54:33,118 --> 00:54:35,076
Room's okay, though.
I poked around.

674
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:37,535
I'm having 'em hold it for me.
I'll be back and forth.

675
00:54:37,619 --> 00:54:41,076
So, in addition to my retainer,
you're paying hotel,

676
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:42,910
Living expenses, secretarial,

677
00:54:42,993 --> 00:54:46,243
Private eye, if we need to make inquiries,
head shrinker, should we go that way.

678
00:54:46,326 --> 00:54:48,452
We'll talk about appeals
if, as and when.

679
00:54:48,576 --> 00:54:52,243
- For now, has she confessed?
- No, of course not. She didn't do it.

680
00:54:52,327 --> 00:54:55,868
Good. That helps. Not that she didn't do it
That she didn't confess.

681
00:54:55,951 --> 00:54:59,868
Course, There's ways to deal with a confession,
but that's one less thing to think about.

682
00:54:59,951 --> 00:55:03,035
Now, interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow.
You sholud be there 3:00.

683
00:55:03,118 --> 00:55:05,368
One more thing.
you keep your mouth shut.

684
00:55:05,452 --> 00:55:08,242
I get the lay of the land,
I tell you what to say.

685
00:55:08,326 --> 00:55:11,576
No talking out of school.
What's out of school?
Everything's out of school.

686
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:14,200
I do the talking.
You keep your trap shut.

687
00:55:14,326 --> 00:55:16,367
I'm an attorney. You're a barber.
You don't know anything.

688
00:55:19,493 --> 00:55:20,409
Okay.

689
00:55:20,492 --> 00:55:22,950
Good. Any questions,
give me a ring.

690
00:55:23,076 --> 00:55:25,409
Turandot suite.
If I'm out, leave a message.

691
00:55:26,617 --> 00:55:29,534
Sure you don't want anything?
No? Okay.

692
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:31,576
You're okay, pal.

693
00:55:31,867 --> 00:55:34,201
You're okay, she's okay,
everything's gonna be hunky...

694
00:55:34,284 --> 00:55:36,326
And the...
and the flapjacks, honey.

695
00:55:43,534 --> 00:55:44,951
There they were,

696
00:55:47,951 --> 00:55:50,159
All going about their business.

697
00:55:52,325 --> 00:55:54,283
It seem like I knew a secret,

698
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:57,867
A bigger one, even,
than what had really happened to Big Dave,

699
00:55:57,950 --> 00:56:00,824
Something none of them knew.

700
00:56:00,908 --> 00:56:03,408
Like I had made it to the outside somehow,

701
00:56:03,533 --> 00:56:06,159
And they were all still struggling
way down below.

702
00:56:29,617 --> 00:56:30,825
Ann.

703
00:56:32,075 --> 00:56:33,450
Hello, Ed.

704
00:56:34,325 --> 00:56:36,574
Would you like to come in, Ann?

705
00:56:38,116 --> 00:56:40,574
No. No, it's very late.

706
00:56:44,658 --> 00:56:47,240
I'm so sorry about your loss.

707
00:56:52,615 --> 00:56:56,824
Course you know that Doris
had nothing to do with it.

708
00:56:56,949 --> 00:56:59,033
Nothing at all.

709
00:56:59,532 --> 00:57:01,407
I know.

710
00:57:02,241 --> 00:57:04,450
Don't worry, Ed.

711
00:57:05,366 --> 00:57:07,324
I came to tell you...

712
00:57:07,407 --> 00:57:10,824
And you should tell Doris...

713
00:57:10,949 --> 00:57:11,908
Yeah?

714
00:57:22,949 --> 00:57:26,823
You know how Big Dave loved camping
and the out of doors?

715
00:57:29,199 --> 00:57:30,282
Yeah.

716
00:57:30,407 --> 00:57:34,490
We went camping last summer
in Eugene, Oregon.

717
00:57:34,573 --> 00:57:38,199
Outside Eugene, Ed.

718
00:57:40,198 --> 00:57:41,198
Yeah?

719
00:57:41,324 --> 00:57:45,073
At night there were lights.
We both saw them.

720
00:57:45,198 --> 00:57:49,198
We never told anyone
outside of our official report,

721
00:57:49,281 --> 00:57:51,240
Our report to the government.

722
00:57:53,365 --> 00:57:55,115
There was a spacecraft.

723
00:57:56,198 --> 00:57:58,282
I saw the creatures.

724
00:57:58,406 --> 00:58:01,323
They led Big Dave onto the craft.

725
00:58:01,407 --> 00:58:04,865
He never told anyone
what they did.

726
00:58:04,948 --> 00:58:06,531
Ann, would you like to...

727
00:58:06,656 --> 00:58:11,197
I cannot repeat it to you,
but this thing goes deep, Ed.

728
00:58:11,323 --> 00:58:14,156
It goes deep
and involves the government.

729
00:58:14,239 --> 00:58:18,407
This was not your wife.
There's a great deal of fear.

730
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:22,448
You know how certain circles
would-would find it,

731
00:58:22,572 --> 00:58:23,572
The knowledge, a threat.

732
00:58:23,698 --> 00:58:26,072
They-they try to limit it, and...

733
00:58:26,197 --> 00:58:30,072
Ann, would you like to come in,

734
00:58:30,198 --> 00:58:32,905
Sit down?

735
00:58:32,989 --> 00:58:34,989
Maybe have a drink.

736
00:58:39,905 --> 00:58:42,614
Sometimes knowledge
is a curse, Ed.

737
00:58:44,531 --> 00:58:47,239
After this happened,

738
00:58:47,323 --> 00:58:48,655
Things changed.

739
00:58:51,155 --> 00:58:52,281
Big Dave...

740
00:58:56,489 --> 00:58:58,947
He never touched me again.

741
00:59:01,905 --> 00:59:03,489
Tell Doris not to worry.

742
00:59:03,572 --> 00:59:06,197
I know it wasn't her.

743
00:59:07,238 --> 00:59:08,988
Perhaps this will
bring it out

744
00:59:09,113 --> 00:59:10,655
Finally.

745
00:59:10,905 --> 00:59:14,571
Perhaps now
it will all come out.

746
00:59:44,113 --> 00:59:45,654
It stinks.

747
00:59:45,904 --> 00:59:47,571
But it's true.

748
00:59:47,655 --> 00:59:49,988
I don't care it's true, it's not true.
It stinks.

749
00:59:50,071 --> 00:59:52,654
You say he was being blackmailed?
By who? You don't know.

750
00:59:52,946 --> 00:59:55,237
For having an affair.
With who? You don't know.

751
00:59:55,321 --> 00:59:58,905
Did anyone else know about it?
Probably not. You don't know.

752
00:59:59,029 --> 01:00:01,070
I knew about it.

753
01:00:01,196 --> 01:00:03,237
Big Dave told me about it...

754
01:00:03,362 --> 01:00:06,154
And the spot he was putting himself in
by getting the money.

755
01:00:06,238 --> 01:00:09,571
Terrific! Your husband backs you up.
That's terrific.

756
01:00:09,529 --> 01:00:11,280
And you gotta give me
something to work with.

757
01:00:11,403 --> 01:00:14,237
Freddy Riedenschneider is good,
but he's not a magician.

758
01:00:14,362 --> 01:00:17,779
He can't just wave his little wand in the air
to make a plausible defense materialize.

759
01:00:17,904 --> 01:00:20,779
Look at what the other side
is gonna run at us.

760
01:00:20,905 --> 01:00:23,487
They got the company books
prepared by you,

761
01:00:23,737 --> 01:00:25,904
Cooked by you.
That's motive.

762
01:00:25,988 --> 01:00:29,029
They got a murder scene you had access to.
That's opportunity.

763
01:00:29,154 --> 01:00:31,903
They got that little trimmer thing he was
stabbed in the throat with.

764
01:00:31,987 --> 01:00:34,112
- A dame's weapon.
- It was Big Dave's.

765
01:00:34,237 --> 01:00:35,988
Don't interrupt me.
That's means.

766
01:00:36,071 --> 01:00:39,070
They got a fine, upstanding pillar
of the business community as a victim,

767
01:00:39,195 --> 01:00:40,778
And then they got you,

768
01:00:40,904 --> 01:00:44,154
A disgruntled, number-juggling underling,

769
01:00:44,237 --> 01:00:46,737
Who on the day in question
was drunk as a skunk...

770
01:00:46,862 --> 01:00:51,736
And whose alibi for the time in question
is being passed out at home, alone.

771
01:00:51,862 --> 01:00:53,986
I was with her.

772
01:00:54,112 --> 01:00:56,028
Like I say,

773
01:00:56,111 --> 01:00:57,695
It stinks.

774
01:01:06,069 --> 01:01:07,737
I killed him.

775
01:01:22,235 --> 01:01:25,945
Okay. You killed him.

776
01:01:27,403 --> 01:01:32,027
Okay, we forget the blackmail thing.
You killed him.

777
01:01:32,111 --> 01:01:33,402
How come?

778
01:01:36,736 --> 01:01:39,235
He and Doris, uh,
were having an affair.

779
01:01:43,068 --> 01:01:44,444
Okay.

780
01:01:44,736 --> 01:01:46,694
How did you know?

781
01:01:49,070 --> 01:01:51,235
I just knew.

782
01:01:52,027 --> 01:01:54,153
A husband knows.

783
01:01:55,110 --> 01:01:56,985
Will anyone else say they knew?

784
01:01:57,068 --> 01:01:58,319
And don't say your wife.

785
01:01:58,403 --> 01:02:00,235
I don't know.

786
01:02:02,402 --> 01:02:04,694
I don't think so.

787
01:02:06,069 --> 01:02:08,194
How did you get into the store?

788
01:02:08,277 --> 01:02:10,068
I took Doris's keys.

789
01:02:10,152 --> 01:02:14,235
Will anyone say they saw you there,
on your way there, in there, on your way back?

790
01:02:16,235 --> 01:02:18,319
I don't think so.

791
01:02:18,402 --> 01:02:21,860
Will anyone corroborate any goddamn part
of your story at all?

792
01:02:21,902 --> 01:02:25,276
Oh, come on! People,
you can't help each other like that.

793
01:02:26,777 --> 01:02:29,151
Let's be realistic, now.

794
01:02:29,235 --> 01:02:33,860
Let's look at our options.
Well, frankly, I don't see any options.

795
01:02:33,985 --> 01:02:37,985
Look, I cannot present story "A."
I cannot present

796
01:02:38,068 --> 01:02:40,192
story "B."

797
01:02:40,318 --> 01:02:43,735
I could plead you for a nutcase,
but you look too composed.

798
01:02:43,818 --> 01:02:45,860
I could offer a guilty plea,
and in return they don't give you the juice,

799
01:02:45,943 --> 01:02:47,860
But I don't think you want to spend
the rest of your life in chino.

800
01:02:47,943 --> 01:02:49,984
I know you didn't hire Freddy Riedenschneider

801
01:02:50,068 --> 01:02:52,193
To hold your hand at a sentencing hearing.

802
01:02:52,276 --> 01:02:54,192
You could have gotten
Lloyd Garroway for that.

803
01:02:54,234 --> 01:02:57,026
No, no, no, no.
We're not giving up yet.

804
01:02:57,110 --> 01:03:00,235
You hired Freddy Riedenschneider,
It means you're not throwing in the towel.

805
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:01,693
I litigate.

806
01:03:01,776 --> 01:03:04,026
I don't capitulate.

807
01:03:04,110 --> 01:03:07,443
All right. No options?
We gotta think.

808
01:03:07,733 --> 01:03:12,026
All right. We go back
to the blackmail thing. Yeah, it titillates.

809
01:03:12,109 --> 01:03:14,234
It's open-ended,
and it makes him the bad guy.

810
01:03:14,359 --> 01:03:17,067
You dig around, you never know.
Something unsavory from his past.

811
01:03:17,151 --> 01:03:21,151
He approaches you to help him with the money,
his past comes back to haunt him. Who's to say?

812
01:03:21,234 --> 01:03:24,859
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Forget the jealous husband thing. That's just silly.

813
01:03:24,984 --> 01:03:27,276
We're going with the blackmail.
I'll be in touch.

814
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,067
I'm comin' out!

815
01:03:38,068 --> 01:03:41,858
Of course there was one person
who could confirm Doris's story,

816
01:03:41,942 --> 01:03:43,483
Or plenty of it.

817
01:03:43,733 --> 01:03:46,358
The dry-cleaning pansy.

818
01:03:46,441 --> 01:03:49,150
But he'd left the hotel,
skipped out on his bill.

819
01:03:50,734 --> 01:03:53,692
He'd also disappeared
from the residence he gave me,

820
01:03:53,816 --> 01:03:55,358
Owing two months'rent.

821
01:03:55,484 --> 01:03:57,900
How could I have been so stupid?

822
01:03:58,024 --> 01:04:00,692
Handing over $10,000
for a piece of paper.

823
01:04:02,733 --> 01:04:05,817
And the man gone,
like a ghost.

824
01:04:05,942 --> 01:04:10,274
Disappeared into thin air
vaporized like the nips at Nagasaki.

825
01:04:10,399 --> 01:04:12,024
Gone now.

826
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,900
All gone.

827
01:04:18,025 --> 01:04:21,107
The money gone,
Big Dave gone,

828
01:04:21,233 --> 01:04:24,150
Doris going.

829
01:04:24,232 --> 01:04:26,691
How could I have been so stupid?

830
01:05:08,065 --> 01:05:11,357
Sooner or later,
everyone needs a haircut.

831
01:05:13,857 --> 01:05:15,982
We were working for the bank now.

832
01:05:16,107 --> 01:05:19,898
We kept cutting the hair,
trying to stay afloat,

833
01:05:19,981 --> 01:05:24,024
Make the payments,
tread the water day by day,

834
01:05:25,232 --> 01:05:26,982
Day by day.

835
01:05:30,856 --> 01:05:33,065
Most people think someone's
accused of a crime,

836
01:05:33,189 --> 01:05:36,357
They haul 'em in and bring 'em to trial,
But it's not like that.

837
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:38,064
It's not that fast.

838
01:05:38,190 --> 01:05:41,189
The wheels of justice turn slow.

839
01:05:41,273 --> 01:05:44,107
They have the arraignment,
then the indictment,

840
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:48,356
And they entertain motions to dismiss
and postpone and change the venue...

841
01:05:48,398 --> 01:05:50,981
And alter this and that
and the other.

842
01:05:51,064 --> 01:05:53,898
They impanel a jury,
which bring more motions.

843
01:05:54,022 --> 01:05:56,898
Then they set a trial date,
and then they change the date.

844
01:05:57,022 --> 01:05:59,064
And then, often as not,
they'll change it again.

845
01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:00,898
Not guilty, your honor.

846
01:06:04,730 --> 01:06:07,356
And through all of it,
we cut the hair.

847
01:06:13,230 --> 01:06:17,023
Meantime, Freddy Riedenschneider
slept at the Metropole...

848
01:06:20,731 --> 01:06:23,148
And shoveled it in
at Da Vinci's.

849
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,023
He'd brought in a private investigator
from Sacramento...

850
01:06:27,106 --> 01:06:30,022
To nose around
into Big Dave's past.

851
01:06:48,438 --> 01:06:52,272
I found myself, more and more,
going over to the Abundas's.

852
01:06:52,396 --> 01:06:56,106
It was a routine we fell into
most every evening.

853
01:06:56,230 --> 01:07:00,063
I even went when Walter was away
on his research trips.

854
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:05,188
He was a genealogist,

855
01:07:05,272 --> 01:07:08,354
Had traced back his side of the family
seven generations,

856
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:10,397
His late wife's eight.

857
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:12,854
It seemed like a screwy hobby,

858
01:07:12,896 --> 01:07:15,397
But then maybe all hobbies are.

859
01:07:18,855 --> 01:07:23,063
Maybe Walter found something there
in the old county courthouses,

860
01:07:23,187 --> 01:07:25,188
Hospital file rooms,

861
01:07:25,313 --> 01:07:28,063
City archives, property rolls,

862
01:07:28,189 --> 01:07:29,438
Registries.

863
01:07:30,855 --> 01:07:34,062
Something maybe like what I found
listening to Birdy play.

864
01:07:35,105 --> 01:07:37,063
Some kind of escape.

865
01:07:37,895 --> 01:07:40,021
Some kind of peace.

866
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:26,020
They got this guy in Germany.

867
01:08:27,145 --> 01:08:29,854
Fritz something or other.

868
01:08:30,812 --> 01:08:32,436
Or is it...
Maybe it's Werner.

869
01:08:32,729 --> 01:08:36,187
Anyway...
He's got this theory.

870
01:08:37,519 --> 01:08:40,353
You want to test something,
you know, scientifically...

871
01:08:40,395 --> 01:08:43,478
How the planet
go 'round the sun,

872
01:08:43,728 --> 01:08:46,310
What sunspots are made of,

873
01:08:46,395 --> 01:08:49,019
Why the water
comes out of the tap...

874
01:08:49,145 --> 01:08:52,228
Well, you gotta look at it.

875
01:08:52,353 --> 01:08:55,895
But sometimes
you look at it...

876
01:08:56,019 --> 01:08:59,395
Your looking changes it.

877
01:09:02,227 --> 01:09:06,061
You can't know the reality
of what happened,

878
01:09:06,186 --> 01:09:07,395
Or what would have happened,

879
01:09:07,478 --> 01:09:11,311
If you hadn't stuck in
your own goddamn schnozz.

880
01:09:11,395 --> 01:09:14,728
So there is no
"What happened."

881
01:09:14,811 --> 01:09:16,477
Looking at something...

882
01:09:16,728 --> 01:09:18,353
Changes it.

883
01:09:23,353 --> 01:09:26,227
They call it
the uncertainty principle.

884
01:09:26,353 --> 01:09:30,977
Sure, it sound screwy,
but even Einstein says
the guy's onto something.

885
01:09:34,727 --> 01:09:36,185
Science.

886
01:09:37,227 --> 01:09:38,394
Perception.

887
01:09:39,436 --> 01:09:40,394
Reality.

888
01:09:43,060 --> 01:09:44,186
Doubt.

889
01:09:45,811 --> 01:09:49,060
Reasonable... doubt.

890
01:09:50,727 --> 01:09:54,269
I'm saying that sometimes
the more you look,

891
01:09:54,393 --> 01:09:56,435
the less you really know.

892
01:09:58,227 --> 01:10:01,727
It's a fact, a proved fact.

893
01:10:01,851 --> 01:10:04,018
In... In a way,

894
01:10:04,101 --> 01:10:06,435
It's the only fact there is.

895
01:10:09,726 --> 01:10:13,851
This Heinie even
wrote it out in numbers.

896
01:10:17,018 --> 01:10:18,893
Burns?

897
01:10:26,018 --> 01:10:28,893

01:10:34,226 --> 01:10:36,060

'36, Another assault beef
at a bar room altercation.

906
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:55,851
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Couple of fistfights, right?
Go to his service record.

907
01:10:58,477 --> 01:11:01,017
Inducted march 15, 1942.

908
01:11:01,059 --> 01:11:05,309
Served in a clerical capacity
in the U.S. Naval shipyards at San Diego.

909
01:11:05,392 --> 01:11:07,892
One fistfight,
broken up by the M.P.S.

910
01:11:07,976 --> 01:11:11,934
No court-martial.
Honorable discharge, may 8, 1945.

911
01:11:12,058 --> 01:11:16,184
- Since then, he's been clean.
- Thank you, Barns. Get lost.

912
01:11:26,392 --> 01:11:28,725
So?

913
01:11:30,225 --> 01:11:32,851
This could be your Dolly's
ticket out of the death house.

914
01:11:32,933 --> 01:11:34,350
So!

915
01:11:35,892 --> 01:11:37,100
I don't get it.

916
01:11:37,225 --> 01:11:40,058
Look, chump.

917
01:11:40,184 --> 01:11:44,683
This is a guy, from what I understand,
told everybody he was a war hero, right?

918
01:11:44,767 --> 01:11:45,933
Island-hopping,

919
01:11:46,059 --> 01:11:48,100
Practically liberated,
the pacific all by himself,

920
01:11:48,224 --> 01:11:51,016
With a knife in one hand,
a gun in the other,

921
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:53,891
And 20 yards of jap guts
between his teeth.

922
01:11:53,933 --> 01:11:57,225
and now it turns out this dope
spent the war sitting on his ass...

923
01:11:57,267 --> 01:12:00,432
In some boat yard
in San Diego.

924
01:12:00,725 --> 01:12:02,724
You asked for blackmail.

925
01:12:02,850 --> 01:12:06,350
Mr. Hail-fellow-well-met,
about to open his own business here,

926
01:12:06,433 --> 01:12:09,891
Has been lying to everybody in this town
for the last four years,

927
01:12:09,933 --> 01:12:12,350
Probably including half the people
sitting on that jury.

928
01:12:12,433 --> 01:12:14,849
Well, it finally caught up with him.

929
01:12:14,933 --> 01:12:19,474
Somebody knew his dirty little secret,
just like your wife says.

930
01:12:19,724 --> 01:12:22,974
They called,
they demanded money.

931
01:12:24,725 --> 01:12:28,016
Did Big Dave say he'd recently
heard from an old friend?

932
01:12:28,099 --> 01:12:32,058
Did Big Dave mention it was something
about his war service?

933
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:35,224
I don't know.
I wasn't there.

934
01:12:35,349 --> 01:12:38,266
You have to tell us.

935
01:12:38,391 --> 01:12:41,350
Maybe he specified,
maybe he didn't.

936
01:12:41,432 --> 01:12:44,432
I'm not putting words
in your mouth, no.

937
01:12:44,724 --> 01:12:49,140
But the point is that this liar,
this cynical manipulator,

938
01:12:49,224 --> 01:12:52,182
Turns to you to help him
out of his jam.

939
01:12:52,265 --> 01:12:54,223
Fat-assed son of a bitch.

940
01:12:55,932 --> 01:12:59,474
- So who... who actually...
- Who?

941
01:12:59,723 --> 01:13:01,349
Who?

942
01:13:01,473 --> 01:13:03,014
I don't know who.

943
01:13:03,098 --> 01:13:06,181
But the point is that
if Mr. Prosecutor over there...

944
01:13:06,265 --> 01:13:09,848
Had devoted half the time
he's spent persecuting this woman...

945
01:13:09,973 --> 01:13:14,264
To even the most cursory investigation
of this schmo's past,

946
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:16,265
Then we might know who.

947
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:21,223
But we can't know who.
We can't know what really happened.

948
01:13:21,348 --> 01:13:24,306
Because the more you look,
the less you know.

949
01:13:26,723 --> 01:13:29,182
But the beauty of it is...

950
01:13:29,306 --> 01:13:32,349
We don't gotta know.

951
01:13:32,472 --> 01:13:36,890
We just gotta show that,
god damn it, they don't know.

952
01:13:37,015 --> 01:13:42,015
Because of Fritz, or Werner,
whatever the hell his name is.

953
01:13:45,848 --> 01:13:48,722
Freddy Riedenschneider sees daylight.

954
01:13:48,764 --> 01:13:51,347
We got a real shot at this, folks.
Let's not get cocky.

955
01:13:51,473 --> 01:13:53,015
Comin' out!

956
01:14:07,431 --> 01:14:09,264
Big Dave.

957
01:14:15,347 --> 01:14:17,305
What a dope.

958
01:14:24,514 --> 01:14:27,389
So maybe Riedenschneider
could fix it for Doris.

959
01:14:27,513 --> 01:14:30,013
Maybe it would all work out.

960
01:14:30,097 --> 01:14:32,055
And I thought,

961
01:14:34,013 --> 01:14:35,763
I hoped,

962
01:14:35,888 --> 01:14:38,388
That maybe there was a way out
for me as well.

963
01:14:39,388 --> 01:14:42,180
He was deaf
when he wrote this.

964
01:14:43,097 --> 01:14:44,346
Who?

965
01:14:45,888 --> 01:14:47,055
Beethoven.

966
01:14:49,097 --> 01:14:52,846
He created it, but he never
actually heard it.

967
01:14:52,929 --> 01:14:55,888
I guess he just heard it all
in his head somehow.

968
01:15:03,429 --> 01:15:06,929
The girl had talent.
Anyone could see that.

969
01:15:07,055 --> 01:15:09,013
And she wasn't
some fly-by-nighter.

970
01:15:09,138 --> 01:15:11,930
She was just a good, clean kid.

971
01:15:12,055 --> 01:15:16,305
If she was going to have a career,
she'd need a responsible adult...
Looking out for her,

972
01:15:16,388 --> 01:15:18,930
Some kind of manager.

973
01:15:20,262 --> 01:15:23,721
She'd have contracts to look at,
be going out on tours,

974
01:15:23,762 --> 01:15:25,846
Playing on the radio, maybe.

975
01:15:25,930 --> 01:15:30,012
I could help her sort through all that without
charging her an arm and a leg.

976
01:15:30,095 --> 01:15:32,054
Just enough to get by.

977
01:15:36,263 --> 01:15:38,179
Then I could be with her,

978
01:15:38,262 --> 01:15:41,220
Enough to keep myself
feeling okay.

979
01:15:42,929 --> 01:15:45,388
Why couldn't that work?

980
01:15:45,512 --> 01:15:47,012
Why not?

981
01:15:53,387 --> 01:15:55,762
- Hi, Mr. Crane.
- Hello, Birdy.

982
01:15:59,262 --> 01:16:01,179
I thought that was real good.

983
01:16:01,261 --> 01:16:04,720
Yeah, I messed up a little bit
on the, um, on the agitato,

984
01:16:04,845 --> 01:16:08,179
But if nobody noticed,
then it's okay.

985
01:16:11,928 --> 01:16:14,137
Oh, this is, um,
a friend of mine.

986
01:16:14,220 --> 01:16:17,219
Tony, um, Mr. Crane.

987
01:16:18,887 --> 01:16:20,219
Hello, Tony.

988
01:16:20,345 --> 01:16:22,261
Hello, sir.

989
01:16:38,386 --> 01:16:40,302
Congratulations.

990
01:16:43,386 --> 01:16:46,012
Think I'll be getting home now.

991
01:16:49,053 --> 01:16:51,011
It was...
nice to meet you, sir.

992
01:16:51,095 --> 01:16:52,969
You too, Tony.

993
01:16:56,844 --> 01:16:58,219
Why couldn't it work?

994
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:03,345
Anyway, that's what I was thinking in the days
leading up to the trial.

995
01:17:03,428 --> 01:17:07,303
It seemed like once that was over,
I'd be ready for a new start.

996
01:17:07,386 --> 01:17:09,719
Freddy Riedenschneider
was busy preparing.

997
01:17:09,844 --> 01:17:12,052
He was very optimistic.

998
01:17:12,177 --> 01:17:16,260
And finally it came...
the first day of the trial,

999
01:17:16,385 --> 01:17:20,344
What Riedenschneider called
'The big show. "

1000
01:17:31,927 --> 01:17:36,051
Where's the judge?
How come there's no judge?

1001
01:17:36,177 --> 01:17:38,052
Where's the judge, Ed?

1002
01:17:39,719 --> 01:17:40,718
Riedenschneider.

1003
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:43,343
How come the judge
doesn't come out?

1004
01:17:43,426 --> 01:17:48,219
The judge comes in last.
He'll come in when Doris gets here.

1005
01:17:48,343 --> 01:17:52,217
So where's Doris?
I thought we started at 10:00.

1006
01:17:52,343 --> 01:17:55,009
Hey, Riedenschneider.
Where's Doris?

1007
01:17:55,093 --> 01:17:56,884
She's late.

1008
01:17:56,926 --> 01:18:00,885
Late?
How can she be late?

1009
01:18:00,968 --> 01:18:04,052
She's in prison, Ed.
None of us are in prison.

1010
01:18:04,177 --> 01:18:08,051
And yet we're not late.
We're on time, Ed.

1011
01:18:08,093 --> 01:18:10,051
How can Doris be late?

1012
01:18:10,135 --> 01:18:12,884
What, they don't have
wake-up calls?

1013
01:18:17,510 --> 01:18:19,676
- All rise.
- No, no.

1014
01:18:20,385 --> 01:18:22,009
Counselors.

1015
01:18:36,051 --> 01:18:37,343
What's going on, Ed?

1016
01:18:37,426 --> 01:18:40,426
I thought there
would be arguments,

1017
01:18:40,717 --> 01:18:42,385
The bailiff and so forth.

1018
01:18:47,217 --> 01:18:49,675
Ed, what is this?

1019
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:51,884
Is this procedure?

1020
01:19:08,758 --> 01:19:13,800
In the matter of the people v. Doris Crane,

1021
01:19:13,883 --> 01:19:16,133
Case number SR-87249,

1022
01:19:16,217 --> 01:19:18,175
Cause now pending
is hereby dismissed...

1023
01:19:18,258 --> 01:19:20,300
I don't understand it.

1024
01:19:21,967 --> 01:19:25,383
Had a real shot at this.
I could've won this thing.

1025
01:19:25,508 --> 01:19:27,758
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

1026
01:19:27,883 --> 01:19:32,217
Your service is no longer needed...
And you are now discharge.

1027
01:19:34,050 --> 01:19:36,050
she's hanged herself.

1028
01:19:38,174 --> 01:19:42,717
I'd brought her a dress to wear to court,
and she'd used the belt.

1029
01:19:42,841 --> 01:19:46,050
At first I thought she'd figured out somehow
how I fit into it...

1030
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:49,424
And couldn't stand it,
couldn't stand knowing.

1031
01:19:49,717 --> 01:19:52,049
But that wasn't it, I'd find out later.

1032
01:19:54,925 --> 01:19:58,883
For now, everything
just seemed ruined.

1033
01:20:00,841 --> 01:20:03,298
Freddy Riedenschneider
went back to Sacramento,

1034
01:20:03,383 --> 01:20:06,382
Still shaking his head,
saying it was the biggest disappointment

1035
01:20:06,508 --> 01:20:08,466
Of his professional career.

1036
01:20:08,715 --> 01:20:11,049
Frankie fell to pieces.

1037
01:20:11,132 --> 01:20:13,382
I suspect he was drinking.

1038
01:20:13,465 --> 01:20:16,965
Anyway, he stopped
coming in to work.

1039
01:20:17,049 --> 01:20:21,383
That left me to keep the place going,
or the bank would've taken it.

1040
01:20:23,257 --> 01:20:26,215
I was the principal barber now.

1041
01:20:26,299 --> 01:20:29,382
I hired a new man
for the second chair.

1042
01:20:29,508 --> 01:20:33,008
I'd hired the guy who did the least gabbing
whie he came in for an interview,

1043
01:20:33,090 --> 01:20:36,841
But I guess the new man had only kept quiet
because he was nervous.

1044
01:20:36,923 --> 01:20:39,882
Once he had the job, he talked from the minute
I opened the shop in the morning...

1045
01:20:40,007 --> 01:20:42,714
Until I locked up at night.

1046
01:20:44,965 --> 01:20:47,756
For all I know, he talked to himself
on the way home.

1047
01:20:51,508 --> 01:20:55,464
When I walked home, it seemed like everyone
avoided looking at me,

1048
01:20:55,716 --> 01:20:57,840
As if I'd caught some disease.

1049
01:20:58,882 --> 01:21:02,715
This thing with Doris,
nobody wanted to talk about it.

1050
01:21:05,131 --> 01:21:08,465
It was like I was a ghost
walking down the street.

1051
01:21:10,256 --> 01:21:12,382
And when I got home now,

1052
01:21:16,131 --> 01:21:18,048
The place felt empty.

1053
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:27,714
I sat in the house,

1054
01:21:30,339 --> 01:21:32,464
But there was nobody there.

1055
01:21:39,007 --> 01:21:41,214
I was a ghost.

1056
01:21:42,297 --> 01:21:44,339
I didn't see anyone.

1057
01:21:44,422 --> 01:21:46,381
No one saw me.

1058
01:21:51,506 --> 01:21:53,714
I was the barber.

1059
01:22:01,131 --> 01:22:05,046
Some bacon and potatoes,
which are supposed to come with it.

1060
01:22:05,131 --> 01:22:08,839
So I pay for it, and I
put the change in my pocket
without really looking...

1061
01:22:08,921 --> 01:22:11,380
'Cause, gosh,
who looks at the change
when you eat there every day?

1062
01:22:11,506 --> 01:22:14,921
Two blocks later I look
at the change she gave me.
Golly, I'm two bits short.

1063
01:22:15,047 --> 01:22:18,713
So I walk back over to Linton's,
find this gal, big argument.

1064
01:22:18,839 --> 01:22:22,380
She doesn't even recall
the transaction.

1065
01:22:22,463 --> 01:22:24,256
Doesn't recall the transaction.
No recollections.

1066
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:27,005
So I said, "Look, dear.
Go ahead. Look at the menu."

1067
01:22:27,047 --> 01:22:29,172
If you're in before 6:00,
it's the whatchamacallit...

1068
01:22:32,713 --> 01:22:34,713
- The early bird special.
- Yeah, the early riser.

1069
01:22:40,005 --> 01:22:41,130
Crane?

1070
01:22:41,879 --> 01:22:44,338
I'm Crane.

1071
01:22:44,422 --> 01:22:47,337
My name's Diedrickson,
county medical examiner.

1072
01:22:48,879 --> 01:22:50,088
Yeah?

1073
01:22:52,797 --> 01:22:55,712
I just came by
for an informal chat.

1074
01:23:01,712 --> 01:23:03,879
Why don't I
buy you a drink?

1075
01:23:07,129 --> 01:23:08,671
Rye.

1076
01:23:09,879 --> 01:23:11,796
Just coffee.

1077
01:23:11,879 --> 01:23:14,796
You sure you don't want
something stiffer?

1078
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:16,754
Coffee it is.

1079
01:23:22,378 --> 01:23:26,753
County M.E. does an autopsy
on anyone who dies in custody.

1080
01:23:27,462 --> 01:23:29,711
I don't know
if you knew that.

1081
01:23:29,837 --> 01:23:31,129
It's routine.

1082
01:23:32,503 --> 01:23:36,920
Doesn't become a matter of public record
unless there's been foul play.

1083
01:23:37,046 --> 01:23:38,921
However,

1084
01:23:39,003 --> 01:23:42,128
I don't think I'm prohibited
from telling you this.

1085
01:23:42,212 --> 01:23:45,212
Of course, I'm not
obliged to either.

1086
01:23:45,336 --> 01:23:47,296
I just don't know.

1087
01:23:48,295 --> 01:23:50,879
But if I were the man,

1088
01:23:51,003 --> 01:23:53,837
I'd want to be told.

1089
01:23:54,961 --> 01:23:56,754
Told what?

1090
01:24:03,044 --> 01:24:06,046
I'm not here to add to your...

1091
01:24:06,711 --> 01:24:07,878
Thanks.

1092
01:24:20,044 --> 01:24:22,003
Your wife was pregnant.

1093
01:24:23,711 --> 01:24:25,419
First trimester.

1094
01:24:29,420 --> 01:24:32,044
There it is.

1095
01:24:32,878 --> 01:24:34,752
I'm sorry.

1096
01:24:37,211 --> 01:24:40,336
Hell, I hope I've done
the right thing.

1097
01:24:44,877 --> 01:24:49,419
My wife and I had not performed
the sex act in many years.

1098
01:25:05,044 --> 01:25:06,252
Well,

1099
01:25:09,752 --> 01:25:12,294
That's really none of my business.

1100
01:25:16,752 --> 01:25:18,294
I'm sorry.

1101
01:25:20,793 --> 01:25:22,418
There it is.

1102
01:25:25,253 --> 01:25:27,085
Good luck, Crane.

1103
01:25:44,168 --> 01:25:47,668
Doris and I had never
really talked much.

1104
01:25:47,751 --> 01:25:50,293
I don't think that's
a bad thing necessarily.

1105
01:25:50,377 --> 01:25:54,751
But it is funny.
Now I wanted to talk.

1106
01:25:54,877 --> 01:25:57,459
Now, with everyone gone,

1107
01:25:57,710 --> 01:26:01,043
I was alone with secrets
I didn't want...

1108
01:26:01,168 --> 01:26:04,084
And no one
to tell 'em to anyway.

1109
01:26:05,334 --> 01:26:08,376
I went to see a woman who was supposed
to have powers in communicating...

1110
01:26:08,501 --> 01:26:11,376
With those who had "Passed across",
as she called it.

1111
01:26:11,459 --> 01:26:14,042
She said that people who had passed across
were picky about

1112
01:26:14,168 --> 01:26:15,918
Who they'd communicate with.

1113
01:26:16,042 --> 01:26:18,792
Not like most people
you run into on this side.

1114
01:26:18,876 --> 01:26:23,417
So you needed a guide,
someone with a gift for talking to souls.

1115
01:26:24,793 --> 01:26:26,126
Give me your hand.

1116
01:26:30,501 --> 01:26:33,917
Well, first she told me that
my wife was in a peachful place,

1117
01:26:34,043 --> 01:26:36,125
That our souls
were still connected,

1118
01:26:36,208 --> 01:26:38,292
That she'd never
stopped loving me...

1119
01:26:38,376 --> 01:26:42,042
Even though she'd done some things
she wasn't proud of.

1120
01:26:43,459 --> 01:26:45,750
Man, she was reading me
like a book.

1121
01:26:47,875 --> 01:26:51,334
She was a phony,
just another gabber.

1122
01:26:51,459 --> 01:26:54,417
I was turning into
Ann Nirdlinger,

1123
01:26:54,708 --> 01:26:57,209
Big Dave's wife

1124
01:26:57,333 --> 01:27:00,167
I had to turn my back
on the old lady,

1125
01:27:00,251 --> 01:27:03,875
On the veils, on the ghosts,

1126
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,916
On the dead,

1127
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,750
Before they all sucked me in.

1128
01:27:20,459 --> 01:27:22,000
Ed?

1129
01:27:22,082 --> 01:27:24,208
How are you holding up?

1130
01:27:24,333 --> 01:27:26,209
Okay, Walter.
Thanks.

1131
01:27:28,125 --> 01:27:30,125
l, uh... I was so damn sorry
to hear about your loss.

1132
01:27:30,208 --> 01:27:33,083
A terrible thing.
It's just damn terrible.

1133
01:27:34,832 --> 01:27:37,333
Uh, Birdy's upstairs.
I'm on long-distance, so...

1134
01:27:37,458 --> 01:27:38,874
Sure, Walter.

1135
01:27:50,416 --> 01:27:52,248
Hello, Birdy.

1136
01:27:53,208 --> 01:27:55,040
Hi, Mr. Crane.

1137
01:27:56,499 --> 01:27:58,874
We haven't seen you since...

1138
01:28:01,416 --> 01:28:03,708
We've certainly missed you.

1139
01:28:06,249 --> 01:28:08,749
Birdy, I've been doing
a lot of thinking.

1140
01:28:11,332 --> 01:28:15,749
There are a lot of things
that haven't worked out for me.

1141
01:28:15,832 --> 01:28:18,914
Life has dealt me some bum cards.

1142
01:28:18,999 --> 01:28:20,915
Or maybe I just haven't played them right.

1143
01:28:20,998 --> 01:28:23,956
Pop doesn't like people
smoking in here.

1144
01:28:29,748 --> 01:28:31,208
I'm sorry.

1145
01:28:31,331 --> 01:28:35,290
Well, sometimes I have a cigarette
when he's away, but never when he's home.

1146
01:28:35,373 --> 01:28:37,915
He can smell it a mile off.

1147
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:40,874
Well, sure.
It's his house.

1148
01:28:40,956 --> 01:28:43,457
That's what he
keeps telling me.

1149
01:28:44,831 --> 01:28:47,415
Anyway, my point is
you're young,

1150
01:28:47,499 --> 01:28:50,915
A kid, really,
your whole life ahead of you.

1151
01:28:52,206 --> 01:28:56,748
But it's not too soon
to start making opportunities for yourself...

1152
01:28:56,873 --> 01:28:59,748
Before it all washes away.

1153
01:29:02,123 --> 01:29:06,248
Yeah, I guess.
Pop says so too.

1154
01:29:06,373 --> 01:29:08,374
You know, I work
pretty hard at school.

1155
01:29:08,497 --> 01:29:10,998
That's swell.

1156
01:29:11,122 --> 01:29:14,915
However, the music,
if you want to pursue it...

1157
01:29:14,997 --> 01:29:19,915
The lessons from Mrs. Swan,
they'll only take you so far.

1158
01:29:19,997 --> 01:29:22,664
There's this guy
in San Francisco.

1159
01:29:23,457 --> 01:29:25,664
I've made inquiries.

1160
01:29:26,790 --> 01:29:29,915
Everybody says
he's the best.

1161
01:29:30,038 --> 01:29:34,206
Trained people who've gone on to big concert
careers in symphony orchestras, the works.

1162
01:29:34,331 --> 01:29:36,915
His name is Jacques...

1163
01:29:36,997 --> 01:29:38,955
Carcanogues.

1164
01:29:39,039 --> 01:29:41,873
I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right.
Anyway, he's a frenchman.

1165
01:29:41,998 --> 01:29:44,372
- Oh, boy. A frenchman, huh?
- You've got talent.

1166
01:29:45,830 --> 01:29:49,206
Anybody can see that.
And he's the best.

1167
01:29:49,289 --> 01:29:51,914
If he sees a student
that he thinks has talent,

1168
01:29:51,998 --> 01:29:55,288
He takes them on for next to nothing.
So you're a cinch to be accepted.

1169
01:29:55,372 --> 01:29:59,163
I could cover the costs of the lessons.
Like I said, it's pretty modest.

1170
01:29:59,247 --> 01:30:02,414
- Oh, Jeez, Mr. Crane.
- No, I have to do it.

1171
01:30:02,498 --> 01:30:05,955
I can't stand by and watch
any more things go down the drain.

1172
01:30:06,038 --> 01:30:08,038
You're young.
You don't understand.

1173
01:30:08,164 --> 01:30:12,914
Well, Jeez, Mr. Crane.
I hadn't really thought about a career or stuff.

1174
01:30:14,372 --> 01:30:16,747
Well, I know you haven't.

1175
01:30:17,996 --> 01:30:22,205
Look, just go see him
as a favor to me.

1176
01:30:22,997 --> 01:30:24,288
I talked to this guy.

1177
01:30:24,371 --> 01:30:27,830
He loosened up a little bit
when I told him how talented you were.

1178
01:30:27,955 --> 01:30:30,121
He's agreed to see you
this Saturday.

1179
01:30:31,288 --> 01:30:34,830
He said, uh, maybe you're
a diamond in the rough.

1180
01:30:35,871 --> 01:30:37,288
His words.

1181
01:30:37,371 --> 01:30:39,913
Jeez, I don't know,
Mr. Crane.

1182
01:30:42,205 --> 01:30:45,079
Just go see him
as a favor to me.

1183
01:31:07,163 --> 01:31:08,329
You are the father?

1184
01:31:08,454 --> 01:31:11,829
No, I'm her...
I'm a family friend.

1185
01:31:11,913 --> 01:31:15,912
I am Carcanogues.
You will wait, my dear.

1186
01:31:25,495 --> 01:31:27,329
I speak with you
on the phone, no?

1187
01:31:27,412 --> 01:31:31,038
You have a special interest
in music?

1188
01:31:38,703 --> 01:31:40,996
A music lover,
alors.

1189
01:31:42,454 --> 01:31:45,161
Um, I don't pretend
to be an expert.

1190
01:31:57,036 --> 01:31:58,661
How did she do?

1191
01:31:58,787 --> 01:32:01,037
She seemed like
a very nice girl.

1192
01:32:03,245 --> 01:32:06,911
She play, monsieur,

1193
01:32:07,036 --> 01:32:09,120
Like a very nice girl.

1194
01:32:10,744 --> 01:32:11,870
Stinks.

1195
01:32:11,995 --> 01:32:13,828
Nice girl,

1196
01:32:13,911 --> 01:32:15,870
However, stinks.

1197
01:32:16,953 --> 01:32:18,744
Well, I don't understand.

1198
01:32:18,870 --> 01:32:20,953
Is not so hard to understand.

1199
01:32:21,036 --> 01:32:24,161
Her playing, uh,
very polite.

1200
01:32:24,244 --> 01:32:26,452
Did she make mistakes?

1201
01:32:26,703 --> 01:32:29,077
Mistake? No.

1202
01:32:29,203 --> 01:32:31,744
It say "E-flat,"
she play E-flat.

1203
01:32:31,869 --> 01:32:35,162
Ping, ping. She play
the right note always.

1204
01:32:35,244 --> 01:32:37,702
Well, I don't understand.
No mistakes?

1205
01:32:37,828 --> 01:32:41,286
Look, she's just a kid.
I thought you taught these kids to...

1206
01:32:41,369 --> 01:32:45,285
No, no, no, monsieur.
That is what I cannot teach her, huh?
I cannot teach her to have the soul.

1207
01:32:46,827 --> 01:32:48,494
Hmm, voyez, monsieur.
Look.

1208
01:32:49,911 --> 01:32:54,119
To play the piano
is not about the fingers.

1209
01:32:54,201 --> 01:32:56,160
We make with the fingers.

1210
01:33:02,202 --> 01:33:07,911
But the music, monsieur,
she come from L'interieur, from inside, huh?

1211
01:33:09,035 --> 01:33:10,993
The music,

1212
01:33:11,035 --> 01:33:13,159
She starts here.

1213
01:33:13,243 --> 01:33:16,161
she come out through here.

1214
01:33:16,243 --> 01:33:19,701
Hmm?
Then perhaps,

1215
01:33:19,827 --> 01:33:21,326
Perhaps,

1216
01:33:21,410 --> 01:33:24,077
She can go here.

1217
01:33:28,368 --> 01:33:31,160
Like I said,
I'm not an expert.

1218
01:33:31,244 --> 01:33:34,910
So you can listen to me,
for I am expert.

1219
01:33:37,369 --> 01:33:40,077
Voyez, monsieur.
This girl, nice girl.

1220
01:33:40,201 --> 01:33:43,826
Very clever hands.
Nice girl.

1221
01:33:43,951 --> 01:33:47,077
I think, uh,
perhaps some day...

1222
01:33:48,076 --> 01:33:51,744
She can make
very good typist, huh?

1223
01:33:57,201 --> 01:33:58,534
Voila.

1224
01:34:06,950 --> 01:34:09,451
- I stank, didn't I?
- He didn't say that.

1225
01:34:09,701 --> 01:34:12,076
No, but more or less.

1226
01:34:13,993 --> 01:34:15,284
I'm no expert,

1227
01:34:15,366 --> 01:34:18,242
But there must be a dozen teachers
better than this clown.

1228
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:20,201
- No, look, really...
- More qualified.

1229
01:34:20,284 --> 01:34:22,200
Goddamn phony.

1230
01:34:23,034 --> 01:34:24,409
Really, it's okay.

1231
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:29,033
I'm not interested in
playing music pofessionally.

1232
01:34:29,117 --> 01:34:31,825
You know, I'm not sure
I want a career at all,

1233
01:34:31,909 --> 01:34:34,408
And if I did, I'd probably
be a veterinarian.

1234
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:40,284
- Veterinarian.
- Yeah.

1235
01:34:42,033 --> 01:34:44,783
But l-I do appreciate
your interest.

1236
01:34:45,701 --> 01:34:47,284
It was nothing.

1237
01:34:47,367 --> 01:34:52,325
I wish I'd played better for you
'cause I know it would've made you real happy.

1238
01:34:56,200 --> 01:34:57,826
You know what you are?

1239
01:34:59,283 --> 01:35:00,825
What?

1240
01:35:00,908 --> 01:35:03,075
You're an enthusiast.

1241
01:35:06,283 --> 01:35:07,949
Yeah, maybe.

1242
01:35:14,867 --> 01:35:19,199
You know, I really do appreciate
the interest you've taken.

1243
01:35:26,825 --> 01:35:28,700
I just wanted to make you happy.

1244
01:35:29,867 --> 01:35:31,948
No, it's really okay.
I wanna do it.

1245
01:35:32,033 --> 01:35:33,366
- Birdy!
- No, it's okay, really.

1246
01:35:33,949 --> 01:35:36,657
Mr. Crane, I wanna do it.
Mr. Crane!

1247
01:35:36,783 --> 01:35:38,283
- Birdy, please don't do that!
- Mr. Crane, please!

1248
01:35:38,366 --> 01:35:41,032
- Heavens to betsy, Birdy!
- Please, Mr. Crane.

1249
01:35:51,158 --> 01:35:54,407
Time slow down
right before in accident,

1250
01:35:54,699 --> 01:35:57,657
And I have time
to think about things.

1251
01:35:59,866 --> 01:36:03,449
I thought about what an undertaker
had told me once.

1252
01:36:03,699 --> 01:36:07,408
That your hair keeps growing
for a while, anyway,

1253
01:36:07,698 --> 01:36:09,741
After you die.

1254
01:36:11,906 --> 01:36:13,990
And then it stops.

1255
01:36:18,323 --> 01:36:21,906
I thought,
"What keeps it growing?"

1256
01:36:23,448 --> 01:36:26,157
Is it like a plant in soil?

1257
01:36:27,365 --> 01:36:29,824
What goes out of the soil?

1258
01:36:29,865 --> 01:36:31,448
The soul?

1259
01:36:33,406 --> 01:36:36,448
And when does the hair
realize that it's gone?

1260
01:37:26,948 --> 01:37:28,155
Hello!

1261
01:37:29,114 --> 01:37:32,031
I noticed you still have
pea stone in your driveway.

1262
01:37:33,197 --> 01:37:37,989
Of course you have to rejuvenate
that every couple of years, don't you?
When the pea stone thins out?

1263
01:37:38,072 --> 01:37:41,113
Ha.
Where does it go, huh?

1264
01:37:41,197 --> 01:37:43,030
Like the odd sock.

1265
01:37:43,155 --> 01:37:48,446
'Course, you know where it goes.
You probably pick pieces of it
off your lawn all the time,

1266
01:37:48,697 --> 01:37:52,113
Churn it up with your lawn mover,
sweep it off your porch there.

1267
01:37:52,198 --> 01:37:55,864
- Pain in the neck.
- Never bothered me.

1268
01:37:55,988 --> 01:37:58,155
Well, have you ever
considered tar macadam?

1269
01:37:58,197 --> 01:38:01,030
People think it's just for public works
or commercial purposes,

1270
01:38:01,114 --> 01:38:04,321
But we have the technology now
to bring it to the homeowner,

1271
01:38:04,405 --> 01:38:07,072
Individual consumer,
at very competitive prices.

1272
01:38:07,196 --> 01:38:11,363
Mind if I show you the specifications?
Afternoon, Ma'am.

1273
01:38:11,489 --> 01:38:13,447
What are you selling?

1274
01:38:16,155 --> 01:38:19,030
Ma'am, I was just telling your husband here
about tar macadam.

1275
01:38:19,155 --> 01:38:21,071
For your home driveway here.

1276
01:38:21,197 --> 01:38:24,988
Here's the brochure.
It's the modern way to...

1277
01:38:25,030 --> 01:38:26,113
Get lost.

1278
01:38:42,114 --> 01:38:43,446
Jesus.

1279
01:39:37,695 --> 01:39:39,320
Doris.

1280
01:39:40,903 --> 01:39:44,069
Don't say anything.
I'm fine.

1281
01:40:04,861 --> 01:40:06,278
Crane.

1282
01:40:07,028 --> 01:40:08,444
Mr. Crane?

1283
01:40:11,069 --> 01:40:13,194
Are you there?

1284
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:15,069
Are you awake?

1285
01:40:17,195 --> 01:40:19,070
He's comin' around.

1286
01:40:20,319 --> 01:40:23,152
Can you talk, sir?
These men have to talk to you.

1287
01:40:23,194 --> 01:40:25,986
Are you awake? Sir?

1288
01:40:26,027 --> 01:40:28,277
He's... he's awake.
Go ahead.

1289
01:40:28,361 --> 01:40:30,069
Are you awake?

1290
01:40:30,194 --> 01:40:31,653
Is he awake?

1291
01:40:31,777 --> 01:40:35,068
Crane, as soon as you're conscious,
we have to tell you that...

1292
01:40:35,194 --> 01:40:38,152
- Uh, is he conscious?
- His eyes are open.

1293
01:40:38,985 --> 01:40:40,361
Uh, you're under arrest.

1294
01:40:40,402 --> 01:40:42,818
Soon as the doctor lets us,
we gotta move you.

1295
01:40:42,861 --> 01:40:45,985
Does he understand that?
We're supposed to tell him.
Are you conscious?

1296
01:40:46,111 --> 01:40:49,777
- They'll take you to the prison hospital.
- Under arrest for murder.

1297
01:40:54,235 --> 01:40:57,152
What?
What'd he say?

1298
01:40:57,193 --> 01:41:00,360
Birdy. Uh, the girl.
No, the girl's okay.

1299
01:41:00,485 --> 01:41:02,069
Broken clavicle.

1300
01:41:02,193 --> 01:41:04,401
That's a collarbone, Crane.
It's broken.

1301
01:41:04,694 --> 01:41:05,819
She's okay, though.

1302
01:41:05,902 --> 01:41:09,694
So he understands, then,
he's under arrest for murder?

1303
01:41:09,817 --> 01:41:11,193
- Big Dave.
- Huh?

1304
01:41:12,943 --> 01:41:14,652
What?
What'd he say?

1305
01:41:14,693 --> 01:41:16,401
He said okay.

1306
01:41:16,694 --> 01:41:18,152
Is that what he said?

1307
01:41:20,235 --> 01:41:23,859
You're under arrest for the murder
of Creighton Tolliver.

1308
01:41:23,985 --> 01:41:25,901
You understad that?

1309
01:41:26,027 --> 01:41:27,860
Does he understand?

1310
01:41:29,860 --> 01:41:31,192
The pansy.

1311
01:41:33,694 --> 01:41:37,735
A kid diving in a water holeoutside of town
had found his car.

1312
01:41:37,859 --> 01:41:39,943
They winched it out...

1313
01:41:40,026 --> 01:41:43,651
And found he'd been beaten,
just like Big Dave said.

1314
01:41:45,109 --> 01:41:47,026
Beaten to death.

1315
01:41:49,234 --> 01:41:53,900
Inside his briefcase
were the partnership papers I'd signed,

1316
01:41:54,026 --> 01:41:56,734
Showing that I'd
given him ten grand.

1317
01:41:57,901 --> 01:42:01,692
For the district attorney,
that made it fall into place.

1318
01:42:01,776 --> 01:42:04,193
I'd gotten Doris
to steal the money.

1319
01:42:04,316 --> 01:42:08,317
The pansy had gotten wise somehow,
so I had to kill him to cover my tracks.

1320
01:42:08,401 --> 01:42:10,942
On the arraignment calendar,

1321
01:42:11,026 --> 01:42:12,858
People v. Edward Crane.

1322
01:42:12,942 --> 01:42:14,067
I was in a spot.

1323
01:42:14,192 --> 01:42:16,942
You are charged
in a one-count complaint...

1324
01:42:17,026 --> 01:42:21,733
I called in Freddy Riedenschneider
and signed the house over to him.

1325
01:42:21,858 --> 01:42:24,192
He said he didn't ordinarily
work that cheap,

1326
01:42:24,317 --> 01:42:27,817
But he figured he owed me something
since the last one hadn't played out.

1327
01:42:27,900 --> 01:42:30,442
- How do you now plead?
- We plead not guilty, your honor.

1328
01:42:30,692 --> 01:42:33,900
I tried to tell him the whole story,
but Riedenschneider stopped me.

1329
01:42:34,026 --> 01:42:35,942
He said the story
made his head hurt.

1330
01:42:36,024 --> 01:42:39,358
He didn't see any way of using it
without putting me on the hot seat...

1331
01:42:39,484 --> 01:42:42,775
- For the murder of Big Dave.
- Trial date is set for Monday a week.

1332
01:42:44,941 --> 01:42:48,192
He told me not to worry, though.
Said he'd think of something.

1333
01:42:50,358 --> 01:42:53,275
They put me
on 24-hour death watch,

1334
01:42:53,358 --> 01:42:58,233
So that I couldn't cheat justice
like they said my wife had done.

1335
01:42:58,359 --> 01:43:01,317
But in front of the jury,
they had it that Doris was a saint.

1336
01:43:01,400 --> 01:43:04,733
The whole plan had been mine.

1337
01:43:04,858 --> 01:43:08,025
I was a svengali
who had forced Doris to join

1338
01:43:08,150 --> 01:43:10,399
My criminal enterprise.

1339
01:43:10,691 --> 01:43:12,192
On and on it went,

1340
01:43:12,316 --> 01:43:16,733
How I'd used Doris,
then let her take the fall.

1341
01:43:16,858 --> 01:43:20,732
That stuff smarted because some of it
was close to being true.

1342
01:43:23,190 --> 01:43:25,858
And then it was
Riedenschneider's turn.

1343
01:43:33,941 --> 01:43:37,982
Ladies and gentlemen, members of the jury,
citizens of Santa Rosa,

1344
01:43:38,107 --> 01:43:41,441
We've just heard from the district attorney
a rather lurid description...

1345
01:43:41,691 --> 01:43:43,356
Of a truly despicable man.

1346
01:43:43,482 --> 01:43:47,649
I gotta hand it to him.
He tossed a lot of sand in their eyes,

1347
01:43:47,774 --> 01:43:50,857
He talked about how
I'd lost my place in the universe,

1348
01:43:50,982 --> 01:43:55,107
How I was too ordinary to be
the criminal mastermind...

1349
01:43:55,191 --> 01:43:57,066
The D.A. made me out to be,

1350
01:43:57,190 --> 01:44:02,065
How there was some greater scheme at work
that the state had yet to unravel.

1351
01:44:02,191 --> 01:44:07,233
And he threw in some of the old truth stuff
he hadn't had the chance to trot out for Doris.

1352
01:44:07,356 --> 01:44:10,815
May at first look at these lines
and see only the chaos
of a work of modern art.

1353
01:44:10,856 --> 01:44:14,982
He told them to look at me,
look at me close.

1354
01:44:15,064 --> 01:44:18,357
That the closer they looked,
the less sense it would all make.

1355
01:44:18,441 --> 01:44:21,981
This human, this barber.

1356
01:44:22,064 --> 01:44:25,231
That I wasn't the kind of guy
to kill a guy,

1357
01:44:25,357 --> 01:44:28,315
That I was the barber,
for Christ's sake.

1358
01:44:28,398 --> 01:44:31,856
I was just like them,
an ordinary man.

1359
01:44:31,982 --> 01:44:35,273
Guilty of living in a world
that had no place for me, yeah.

1360
01:44:35,356 --> 01:44:37,898
Guilty of wanting to be
a dry cleaner, sure.

1361
01:44:38,023 --> 01:44:39,231
But not of murder.

1362
01:44:39,356 --> 01:44:43,439
But most specifically,
this is a barber's dilemma.

1363
01:44:43,689 --> 01:44:45,898
For he is modern man.

1364
01:44:46,022 --> 01:44:48,065
He said I was modern man.

1365
01:44:48,189 --> 01:44:50,023
He is your reflection.

1366
01:44:50,064 --> 01:44:51,648
And if they voted to convict me,

1367
01:44:51,731 --> 01:44:55,647
They'd be practically cinching the noose
around their own necks.

1368
01:44:55,730 --> 01:44:59,063
He told them to look not at the facts,
but at the meaning of the facts.

1369
01:44:59,189 --> 01:45:02,314
And then he said
the facts had no meaning.

1370
01:45:02,440 --> 01:45:05,856
It was a pretty good speech
and even had me going,

1371
01:45:05,981 --> 01:45:07,356
Until Frankie interrupted it.

1372
01:45:10,689 --> 01:45:15,313
What kind of man are you?

1373
01:45:15,439 --> 01:45:17,148
Move for a mistrial!
Your honor!

1374
01:45:17,231 --> 01:45:19,188
What kind of man are you?

1375
01:45:19,272 --> 01:45:20,771
Move for a mistrial.

1376
01:45:20,855 --> 01:45:24,148
Well, he got his mistrial,
but the well had run dry.

1377
01:45:24,230 --> 01:45:26,188
There was nothing left to mortgage.

1378
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:30,731
Riedenschneider went home,
and the court appointed Lloyd Garroway,

1379
01:45:30,855 --> 01:45:32,980
Who threw me
on the mercy of the court.

1380
01:45:33,064 --> 01:45:35,854
Your honor,
we plead guilty...

1381
01:45:35,939 --> 01:45:39,147
With extenuating circumstances.

1382
01:45:39,231 --> 01:45:41,813
It was my only chance,
he said.

1383
01:45:41,897 --> 01:45:45,356
I guess that meant
I never had a chance.

1384
01:45:47,772 --> 01:45:52,980
He wasn't buying any of that
modern man stuff, or the uncertainty stuff,

1385
01:45:53,064 --> 01:45:54,813
Or any of the mercy stuff either.

1386
01:45:54,896 --> 01:45:57,188
This man is a menace
to society.

1387
01:45:57,229 --> 01:46:00,772
Nope, he was going
by the book,

1388
01:46:00,855 --> 01:46:03,438
And the book said
I got the chair.

1389
01:46:03,687 --> 01:46:06,188
He has forfeited the right
to his own life.

1390
01:46:06,272 --> 01:46:08,646
So here I am,

1391
01:46:08,729 --> 01:46:11,229
At first I didn't know
how I got here.

1392
01:46:11,355 --> 01:46:13,312
I knew step by step,
of course,

1393
01:46:13,438 --> 01:46:17,021
Which is what I've told you,
step by step.

1394
01:46:17,147 --> 01:46:21,021
But I couldn't see any pattern.

1395
01:46:21,104 --> 01:46:22,729
Now that I'm near the end,

1396
01:46:22,812 --> 01:46:25,812
I'm glad that this men's magazine
paid me to tell my story.

1397
01:46:26,022 --> 01:46:29,438
Writing it has helped me
sort it all out.

1398
01:46:29,688 --> 01:46:31,396
They're paying me
flve cents a word,

1399
01:46:31,688 --> 01:46:34,063
So you'll pardon me if sometimes I've told you
more than you wanted to know.

1400
01:46:35,896 --> 01:46:39,354
But now all the disconnected
things seem to hook up.

1401
01:46:40,396 --> 01:46:43,145
That's the funny thing
about going away,

1402
01:46:43,229 --> 01:46:45,646
Knowing the date
you're going to die.

1403
01:46:46,855 --> 01:46:50,730
And the men's magazine
wanted me to tell how that felt.

1404
01:47:16,103 --> 01:47:20,145
Well, it's like pulling away
from the maze.

1405
01:47:21,811 --> 01:47:24,436
While you're in the maze,
you go throught willy-nilly,

1406
01:47:24,686 --> 01:47:27,186
Turning where you think
you have to turn,

1407
01:47:27,270 --> 01:47:29,312
Banging into the dead ends,

1408
01:47:29,395 --> 01:47:31,270
One thing after another.

1409
01:47:36,894 --> 01:47:38,811
But you get
some distance on it,

1410
01:47:38,894 --> 01:47:40,853
And all those twists
and turns...

1411
01:47:40,936 --> 01:47:45,311
Why, they're the shape
of your life.

1412
01:47:47,187 --> 01:47:49,311
It's hard to explain.

1413
01:47:52,019 --> 01:47:55,353
But seeing it whole
gives you some peace.

1414
01:48:29,352 --> 01:48:32,310
The men's magazine
also asked about remorse.

1415
01:48:32,436 --> 01:48:37,310
Yeah, I guess I'm sorry
about the pain I caused other people.

1416
01:48:38,435 --> 01:48:41,144
But I don't regret anything.

1417
01:48:41,227 --> 01:48:43,185
Not a thing.

1418
01:48:43,228 --> 01:48:44,893
I used to.

1419
01:48:45,019 --> 01:48:47,852
I used to regret
being the barber.

1420
01:49:52,476 --> 01:49:55,309
I don't know
where I'm being taken.

1421
01:49:57,018 --> 01:49:59,850
I don't know what I'll find
beyond the earth and sky,

1422
01:50:01,059 --> 01:50:02,892
But I'm not afraid to go.

1423
01:50:04,393 --> 01:50:07,850
Maybe the things I don't understand
will be clearer there,

1424
01:50:07,893 --> 01:50:10,184
Like when a fog blows away.

1425
01:50:12,976 --> 01:50:15,016
Maybe Doris will be there.

1426
01:50:16,017 --> 01:50:19,642
And maybe there
I can tell her...

1427
01:50:19,766 --> 01:50:21,809
All those things...

1428
01:50:22,850 --> 01:50:25,725
They don't have words for here.
