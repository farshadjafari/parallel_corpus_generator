- What?
- You been in there 10 minutes, man.

10
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,505
- Shut up.
- Yeah, okay.

11
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,341
You know, one day Chief gonna come in here
and catch you taking them Hollywood showers.

12

I should snitch on you.
Come on, move, man.

13

- Get out of my way, snitch.
- Come, move, man.

I got you, man.

16
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:48,269
- Ooh!

17
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,146
Quit playin', man.

18
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,988
- What's crackin' Fisher?
- Your head, if you don't get away from me.

19
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:02,575
What is that on your face?

20
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:06,537
- 
- Say something. Say something else.

21
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:08,456
- Say something, huh? You're always talking.
- Fish!

22

Relax. I'm cool, man.

- Punk!
- Hey, hey, hey!

26
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,347
Petty Officer Fisher,
you've been accused of violating...

27
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:30,019
article 128— assault on a superior
noncommissioned officer.

28
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,438
- How do you plead?
- Guilty, sir.

29
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:36,192
Well, in your statement, you say
your attack on Petty Officer Berkley...

30
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,487
was provoked by a racial slur.

31
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:41,739
- Is that correct?
- Yes, sir.

32
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:45,409
Petty Officer Berkley, did you make
any racial remarks to Petty Officer Fisher?

33
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:47,161
- No, sir.
- Berkley-

34
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,872
- Stand at attention!
- Stand at attention.

35
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,670
This is the United States Navy, son.

36
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:58,172
I find you guilty.

37
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,925
There'll be a forfeiture
of $200 for two months...

38
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,886
you'll be restricted to the boundaries
of the ship for 45 days...

39
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:07,098
and you'll perform
45 days' extra duty.

40
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:10,142
I'm reducing you from ship's serviceman
petty officer third class...

41
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:11,978
to ship's serviceman seaman...

42
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,438
and I'm recommending
that you be evaluated...

43
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:18,484
at the psychiatric clinic
before our next underway period.

44
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,486
You're dismissed.

45
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:24,907
- So what happened?
- How'd it go?

46
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,743
Same old, same old. I got busted,
but now I gotta go to the psych clinic.

47
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,870
- You gotta go to the nuthouse?
- Farmer, shut up, man.

48
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:32,790
Give it up to the shrink? Damn.

49
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,182
See you next week.

50
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,271
Seaman Fisher.

51
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,608
Right this way.

52
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:09,118
I understand it's not
your first time here.

53
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,163
- You saw Dr. Williams?
- Nah. He saw me.

54
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,252
- That's your wife?
- Yes.

55
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,964
Have a seat.

56
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,640
I understand you like to fight.

57
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,726
It's the only way some people learn.

58
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,978
Hmm. But you pay the price
for teaching 'em.

59
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:42,401
- You wanna talk about it?
- About what?

60
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:44,445
Whatever's bothering you.

61
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:47,656
Why does something gotta be bothering me?

62
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,618
What, 'cause I jumped on a white boy...

63
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:53,120
something must be wrong with me?

64
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:56,707
"Send him to the psychiatrist.
Nigga tried to kill his master.

65
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:59,668
- 
- He must be crazy. "

66
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,754
You looking for a discharge, Fisher?

67
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,507
- I ain't lookin' for nothin'.
- That's where you're headed.

68
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:08,594
- If I want out of the navy, I'll just leave.
- Unauthorized absence?

69
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,013
- Yeah, if that's what the navy calls it.
- Mm-hmm.

70
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,140
Running away how
you handle your problems?

71
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:15,768
- I don't have no problems.
- Hmm.

72
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,020
Where you from, Fisher?

73
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,861
- Where'd you spend your childhood?
- Cleveland.

74
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,863
Parents still live there?

75
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,865
I never had any parents.

76
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,493
They deceased?

77
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,496
I never ha— 
I never had parents.

78
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,625
That would make you
a medical miracle, Seaman Fisher.

79

Where you from?

80
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,547
I'm from under a rock.

Okay.

82
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,594
Okay. All right.

I'm gonna see you... next week.

- I ain't comin' back.
- Why not?

85
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:00,062
- 'Cause there's nothin' wrong with me.
- I agree with you there.

86
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,106
See you next week.

87
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,442
See the receptionist
on your way out.

88

Hmm. I gotta—

You know what?
I'm gonna get back to the ship.

Get your monkey hands off me, man.

I thought you may have
forgotten your way here last week...

114
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,578
so I took the liberty
of sending an escort team for you.

115
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:24,331
You may be able to make me come here,
but you can't make me talk.

I don't have time to waste.

Now, I get three sessions only...

121
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:50,774
to make an eval and a recommendation
to your commanding officer.

122

You know he wants to throw you
out of the navy, don't you?

not talk to me if you want to.

00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:35,642
I see.

172
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:39,479
I was born in prison two months
after my father was murdered.

173
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:41,732
Why was she confined— Your mother?

174
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:44,359
I don't know.
All I know is what I told you.

175
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,195
- So you were turned over to the state?
- Yeah.

176
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,365
State placed me in this orphanage.

177
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:54,494
It was supposed to be until
my mother got out to claim me...

178
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:57,414
but she got out,
but she never claimed me.

179
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,375
- Hmm. How long were you there?
- Two years.

180
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:03,670
How's that make you feel, Antwone?

181
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:09,551
- I don't know.
- Come on. You must have some
feelings about it. What, you—

182
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,928
What did it feel like?

183
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,975
- Rainy days.
- Like rainy days?

184
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,394
Okay. Why is that?

185
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:25,067
You know, in Cleveland, it— it rains.

186
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,653
Not all the time, but, uh...

187
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:31,323
to a kid who wants
to go out and play...

188
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,700
it seems like it rains every day.

189
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:39,373
But, uh— Kids expect it
to rain sometimes, but—

190
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:42,751
One kid— It rained too much.

191
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,463
- Hmm.
-

192
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,340
Okay.

193
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,343
You want me to come back next week?

194
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,470
Yes, I do.

195
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,472
You ever try to find her— Your mother?

196
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:58,308
No, sir.

197
00:16:58,393 --> 00:17:00,936
Okay. Next week.

198
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:09,236
Busy day?

199
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,155
Uh— No more than usual.

200
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:16,993
Hmm. Tomatoes are from our garden.

201
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:18,995
Yeah?

202
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,503
Hmm.

203
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:30,173
They're so much better than last year.|

204
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:32,259
Hmm.

205
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:36,221
I mean, I'm no green thumb,
or anything, but—

206
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,682
Who knows? Maybe I'm learning.

207
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,487

I was placed in the Tate foster home.

219
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,846
Reverend Tate-
He was a fire-breathing preacher.

220
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,848
He had his own storefront church.

221
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,017
There was only a few members.

222
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:25,103
There was Miss Tate,
Cousin Nadine...

223
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:29,357
my foster brothers, Keith—
Keith was half white—

224

226
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:37,324

Bible study on Tuesday.

228
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:42,204
Y. P. W. W. meetings on Thursday.

229
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,498
Choir rehearsal on Friday.

230
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:47,793
We found out that if we caught

- she'd give us vanilla wafers after church.

- Reverend Tate—

238
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:10,690
He didn't like Dwight at all.

239
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:12,776
He said he had too much pride.

240
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,778
So he tried to beat it out of him.

241
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:19,866
Sometimes he would even try
to beat him to death.

242
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:22,536
- Did he beat you?
- No, sir.

243
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,038
I think he pitied me.

244
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:30,585
And I liked him for it,
but I was ashamed of him.

245
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,589
What about Mrs. Tate?

246
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,510
What about her?

247
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:42,264
I don't know which one of you no-good,
rotten, hardheaded niggas...

248
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:45,767
put your dirty hands on my walls...

249
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,777
but I bet I'll get the right one.

250
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:03,076
I took you in when your no-account
mammies threw you away.

251
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,037
And this is the thanks I get?

252
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,251
You ungrateful niggas.

253
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:22,345
- 
-

254
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,982
Hmm.

255
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,984
Now I know I got the right one.

256
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,862
She used to brag about...

257
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,658
beating me unconscious.

258
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,707
Huh. She threatened to do it again...

259
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:55,962
but she never did.

260
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:58,089
Why do you think she never did?

261
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:01,551
Uh, maybe she was scared.

262
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:05,931
She found a new way
to get me though.

263
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:08,975
- 
- So you like fire, huh?

264
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,394
No, m'dear. No, m'dear.
I don't like fire.

265
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:18,693
You... stay away...

266
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:22,197
from things that don't belong to you.

267
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,491
You hear me?

268
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:27,160
- Do you hear me?
- Yes. Yes, m'dear.

269
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,204
- You hear me?
- Yes.

270
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,124
Dumb nigga.

271
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,886
I tried everything I could to get her to like me.

272
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:48,932
Nothin' ever worked.

273
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,935
- Were you the youngest of the foster children?
- No.

274
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:55,105
Dwight was the youngest.

275
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:57,732
I was in the middle
and Keith was the oldest.

276
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:01,277
Miss Tate- She used to
put us against...

277
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:05,323
each other so much,
we started hating each other.

278
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:09,160
But I think deep down inside,
we really hated ourself.

279
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:11,746
- What do you mean?
- Keith was half white.

280
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:14,499
She would try to compare
Keith to me and Dwight.

281
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:18,545
You know, he had the good hair
and we had the bad hair.

282
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:23,091
She used to say how Keith was better
than us 'cause his father was white.

283
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:27,345
I wished I was Keith.

284
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,347
Hmm.

285
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:32,267
Not even Keith could escape
from being called a nigga.

286
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,269
She hardly used our names.

287
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,731
She said the word "nigga" so often—
called us nigga so often—

288
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:39,941
that we could tell
who she was talking to...

289
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:41,943
by the way she said the word nigga.

290
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:43,820
What happened to Dwight and Keith?

291
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,781
Dwight is in Lucasville
State Penitentiary.

292
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:49,492
Keith got taken by- by his mother.

293
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:51,494
He was raped by one
of her boyfriends.

294
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,580
Hmm.

295
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:58,168
- Did what happened to Keith happen to you?
- Hell, no.

296
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:02,255
Okay.

297
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,257
Okay.

298
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,926
Was Mrs. Tate ever—|

299
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:09,971
- Was she ever nice to you?
- Yeah, there were times.

300
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:13,141
Sometimes she would
tell her friends that...

301
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:16,811
we were good kids and that
she was proud of us- Chummy times.

302
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:19,064
- Chummy times?
- Yeah.

303
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:22,233
I got to where I can tell
what kind of day it was gonna be...

304
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:24,360
by the scent in the air
when I awoke.

305
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:26,446
- How could you tell?
- Well—

306
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:30,116
If I awoke and there was
the smell of grits and eggs...

307
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:34,245
or water steaming off the pavement
as she hosed it down...

308
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,456
I had to look out all day.

309
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:40,168
But if I smelled pancakes,
everything was okay.

310
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,253
Did she make pancakes very often?

311
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:44,547
No, sir.

312
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:47,300
I can delay my next appointment
if you want to talk some more.

313
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,386
No, sir.

314
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:55,558
Hey, Slim.

315
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:59,270
- What?
- You goin' home next leave?

316
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:01,481
Hell, yeah. I gotta tend to the flock.

317
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,984
Hey, when I get leave,
I'm gonna be like a vampire...

318
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:06,986
comin' to town with his coffin—

319
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:09,447
Just a place to lay down
before I get down.

320
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:11,950
- 
- What's that mean?

321
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:13,952
Man, shut up. People tryin' to sleep.

322
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:16,412
- Shut your grouchy ass up. Jesus.
-

323
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:18,832
Hey, when you goin' home, Pork Chop?

324
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:21,835
When your mama quit trippin'
and send me my money.

325
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,796
- 
- What about you, Fish?

326
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,298
When you goin' home?

327
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:29,300
Fish.

328
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:31,344
Fish.

329
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:53,908
Last night I had a dream about Jesse.

330
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,077
Who is Jesse?

331
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:58,163
He was my best friend.

332
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:02,458
When I wasn't at home, I was probably
wherever Jesse was, for three reasons.

333
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:04,669
One was, being his friend...

334
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,713
- he wouldn't beat me up.
- Hey, Jesse, look.

335
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:09,299
- I got a bug.
- And the other reasons were...

336
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:11,593
- so he wouldn't beat me up.
- I only got three.

337
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:13,595
- I liked him a whole lot.
- Gimme yours.

338
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:28,902
We used to drive
our friend Kenny crazy.

339
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:31,738
- Let's get Kenny.
- Kenny hung around me...

340
00:25:31,822 --> 00:25:34,532
for the same reasons
I hung around Jesse.

341
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:37,785
- Hey, Kenny. Lemme see.
- Where's Jesse?

342
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:41,331
- Ugh!
-

343
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:43,666
Bugs! Bugs! Get 'em out!

344
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:45,668
- Bugs! Bugs! Get 'em out!
- Hey, Kenny, what's wrong?

345
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:47,545
Hey, Kenny, don't forget to write.

346
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:48,254
Hey, Kenny, don't forget to write.

347
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:50,506
- Miss Tate- She hated Jesse.
- ♪ Oh, yes, ladies ♪

348
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:52,842
She hated seeing us together even more.

349
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:54,969
♪ My humpty nose'll tickle your- ♪

350
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,096
But for years she couldn't keep us apart.

351
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:59,557
I was so happy
when she kicked me out.

352
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:01,434
Twonny.

353
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,603
♪ Both how I'm livin'
and my nose is large ♪♪

354
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:09,317
That hoodlum nigga Jesse
called up here asking for you.

355
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,153
Said something about y'all
going to the picture show.

356
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:14,864
Now, that's the devil's work.

357
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:17,992
And who told you you could go
to the picture show anyhow?

358
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:21,704
I mean, where you get the money, nigga?
Did you steal it?

359
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:23,706
I already told you.
I've been raking lawns.

360
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:27,460
Well, you would have stole it,
so give me the money.

361
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:30,505
I said give me the money.

362
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,471
You don't know what to do
with no money nohow.

363
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,473
That's why I never
let you have none.

364
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:43,685
Why you always gotta
make things difficult for me?

365
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:46,020
Difficult?

366
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:49,524
Difficult. Where you learn
such fancy words at?

367
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:52,318
- Fancy? It ain't no fancy word.
- Don't sassy me, boy.

368
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:54,320
- Ain't no one sassin' you.
- Don't sassy me!

369
00:26:54,405 --> 00:26:57,824
- Ain't no one sassin' you.
-

370
00:26:57,908 --> 00:26:59,867
You are not beatin' me no more.

371
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:01,995
No more!

372
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,499
Lord Jesus.

373
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,710
I want you out of my house.

374
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,712
Hmm?

375
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:12,714
And who you think
gonna take you in, huh?

376
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:16,968
Retarded nigga.
Don't nobody want you.

377
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:20,305
Your damn mammy
didn't even want you.

378
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,390
Gimme my shoe.

379
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:26,769
Must have felt pretty good
when you took that shoe from her.

380
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:30,481
Yeah. I felt like I was gonna
go right upside her head.

381
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:32,525
- I just chilled.
- Why'd you chill?

382
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:36,446
I don't know.

383
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,573
- Well, I'm glad you did.
- Yeah.

384
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,617
How'd you feel?

385
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:44,203
I felt like I won a prize.

386
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:47,874
- But it scared me.
- Why?

387
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:50,960
It was the first time
I ever felt more powerful than her.

388
00:27:51,045 --> 00:27:52,962
It was like a surprise.

389
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:58,301
- Whatever happened to Jesse?
- We lost touch. You know how it is.

390
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:00,303
Yeah.

391
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:03,848
It may be helpful to understand
the mentality of people like the Tates.

392
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,143
Here.

393
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,896
It's called The Slave Community.

394
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,690
- Why I gotta understand somebody beatin' on me?
- What you went through...

395
00:28:12,775 --> 00:28:15,443
was in part the result
of the treatment...

396
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:18,154
that slaves received
from their masters...

397
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,698
and then passed on
to their own children...

398
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:23,659
generation to generation to generation,
right on down to the Tates.

399
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:27,413
Sir, that sounds like an excuse.

400
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:29,540
- I mean, I was a kid.
- I understand.

401
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:31,584
Sound like you takin' up for 'em.

402
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:34,170
I'm not saying what they did was right.
What they did was wrong.

403
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,172
We all have choices.
They made the wrong choices.

404
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:38,174
But this is not about them.
This is about you.

405
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:41,094
You were sent to me because
you have an anger problem.

406
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:43,179
Well, you've got the right to be angry.

407
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:47,975
But you also have to learn to channel
that anger- to use it constructively.

408
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:51,979
Instead of getting into fights, go to the gym.
Hit the bag. Lift the weights.

409
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:56,192
You have to use that energy
to better yourself.

410
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:59,987
- You say you're taking Japanese classes, right?
- Yeah.

411
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,824
Okay. You're already
on the right track.

412
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:05,493
Can we talk about this next week?

413
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,495
Three sessions, son.

414
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,580
Unfortunately, that's all I'm
given to make a recommendation.

415
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:13,292
And I'm gonna recommend
that you be given a second chance.

416
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:15,336
That is what you want, isn't it?
To stay in the navy?

417
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:21,509
- Yes, sir.
- Okay. Okay, stay out of trouble.

418
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:27,640
Antwone.

419
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,684
Antwone!

420
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:35,231
- So, how you doin'?
- I'm cool.

421
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:38,943
- You don't seem cool.
- I'm all right.

422
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,612
Well, what are you doin' in there?
You still working on that paper?

423
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:44,490
No, I'm finished. I just went
through there for a shortcut.

424
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:46,784
Oh. Where you going?

425
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:49,370
Nowhere.

426
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:53,875
I-I gotta go.
Cheryl, I'll talk to you later.

427
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,969
Why you always talkin' about somebody's mama?

428
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,929
Man, we ain't talkin' about somebody's mama.

429
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:09,682
- We talkin' about your mama.
-

430
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,767
Hey, Fish!

431
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:14,187
Yeah, I bet you won't be fightin'
no more honkies on this boat.

432
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:17,356
Man, this ain't no boat. This a ship.

433
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:19,734
This a ship.

434
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,236
Country-ass Negro.
Who let you in the navy?

435
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,490
Fish.

436
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:28,034
What's that book you readin'?

437
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:31,579
Let me see the cover.
"Slave Community. "

438
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,915
What you readin' that shit for?

439
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:35,833
'Cause I want to.

440
00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:38,336
This ain't no slave ship.

441
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,421
And these ain't no slavery days.

442
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:43,508
I can't tell. You the only buck-dancin'
Uncle Tom on this ship.

443
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:45,426
- 
- You a part-time brother.

444
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:48,679
Yo, Grayson, man, what—
Why you always talkin' shit, man?

445
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:51,682
- What I do ain't got nothin' to do with you.
- You better get out my face.

446
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:55,353
Either you tryin' to hang out with the brothers,
or you trying to hang out with the white boys.

447
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:57,188
- Sit your ass back down.
- You better make up your mind.

448
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,232
- What you goin' do? What you goin' do?
- Get out my face.

449
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:01,108
- Come on, Fish.
- Stop it!

450
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:04,904
- Let him go. You weak, Fish.
-

451
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:08,366
Thank you, sir.

452
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:10,409
Who's next?

453
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:18,125
So, uh, Dr. Davenport—
Sent him to the gym?

454
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,378
Hit the punchin' bags?

455
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:22,880
Ain't that what you prescribing?

456
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:25,633
So why are you here?

457
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,761
You feelin' under pressure?

458
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:31,681
You feel like, uh,
a rock is on top of you?

459
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:33,558
Come on, now. Speak the hell up.

460
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:36,978
You better make it snappy.
You only got three sessions comin'.

461
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:39,355
What are y'all lookin' at?

462
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,357
What you lookin' at?

463
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:43,651
You feelin' sick?
Do you need a healin'?

464
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,028
Do you need a healin'?
Do you need a healin'?

465
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:47,905
Huh? Do you need a healin'?

466
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:50,950
Some of y'all sick-ass sailors need
to come back after working hours.

467
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:54,328
See, that's when Dr. Davenport—
He'll be laying his hands on you.

468
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:56,747
Or he may have a book in there
that may have the answers...

469
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:58,874
to all your problems
and all your questions.

470
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:00,876
Ain't that right?

471
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:05,673
Ain't that right?

472
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:10,970
Would you like to step into my office?

473
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,562
Are you finished?

474
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:22,523
- I thought I was just getting started.
- Let me tell you something.

475
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:25,359
It may have slipped your mind, but you
are addressing a superior officer.

476
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:28,529
You understand me?
Do you understand me?

477
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:31,657
- Yes, sir. I slipped up.
- You better believe you did.

478
00:32:31,742 --> 00:32:34,994
No, sir, I mean I slipped up
when I talked to you.

479
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,040
- What?
- Three sessions, right?

480
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:41,167
- That's correct.
- Can't be floutin' regulations.

481
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:44,211
- That's correct.
- Well, what do I do, Commander?

482
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:48,382
'Cause I don't know what to do.

483
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:53,012
I don't know what to do.

484
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,161
Tired?

485
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:21,123
Hmm.

486
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:24,126
How was your day?

487
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,464
Long.

488
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,675
Not complaining, though.

489
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:33,928
Well, don't wait up.
I got a lot of work to do.

490
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,972
I know.

491
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:42,228
- Good night.
- Good night.

492
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:48,359
Well, it's nice to finally
be off restriction for a change.

493
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,778
- Yeah, I'm gonna be squared away from now on.
- Whoa.

494
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,947
Y'all want something
from the exchange?

495
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,949
Man, what's up with
you and the exchange?

496
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,992
You spend more time there
than you do on restriction.

497
00:33:57,077 --> 00:33:59,620
- I'm just trying to be a good shipmate, man.
- I'm only kiddin' with you.

498
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:01,831
- Well, look, bring me back some Skittles.
- And a Snickers.

499
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:03,833
- And some pork skins.
- And a sandwich.

500
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:06,585
- Thank you.
- All right.

501
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:10,131
What are you doing here, sir?

502
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:14,051
I was in the area.
Saw your ship.

503
00:34:14,136 --> 00:34:17,304
So you just saw this big old ship
moored alongside the pier?

504
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:24,645
I want to see you back in my office—
Next Wednesday after knockoff.

505
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:28,149
That is, if you want to continue.

506
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:33,279
I think I need to check
my calendar first, sir.

507
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:35,281
Okay.

508
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:38,868
- Well, you let me know, okay?
- Yes, sir.

509
00:35:09,483 --> 00:35:11,859
Hey, Cheryl.

510
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,944
- Hey.
- Hey. What's goin' on?

511
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:16,071
- Nothin'.
- You just getting off work?

512
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:19,408
- Yeah.
- Uh—

513
00:35:19,493 --> 00:35:21,869
You, uh— You mad?

514
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,997
Why would I be mad?

515
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:29,835
I'm sorry.

516
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:33,839
That's cool.|

517
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:36,717
- So you finally off restriction?
- Yeah.

518
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:40,137
- Yeah.
- So you can hang out now?

519
00:35:40,222 --> 00:35:42,556
- Yeah.
- So what about now?

520
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:44,767
I'm off.

521
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:48,938
No. I gotta meet somebody. Well, I promised
I'd meet somebody in a few minutes.

522
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:50,940
- So—
- Oh.

523
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:52,983
What's her name?

524
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:55,486
No. It ain't like that.

525
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,987
- Okay.
- Not like that.

526
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:59,615
What about tomorrow?

527
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:03,077
Um, what- What about
the day after tomorrow?

528
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,412
Say, Wednesday after knockoff?

529
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:08,624
- That would be better.
- Okay.

530
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:12,086
Um, meet me in the lobby
of the female barracks at 1700.

531
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,172
- Hmm. Okay. All right.
- Okay.

532
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:17,049
- I'll meet you at 1700.
- All right.

533
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:20,094
- Yeah.
- It's a date.

534
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:28,727
-  Are we done?
- Yes, we are.

535
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:31,188
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

536
00:36:31,273 --> 00:36:34,191
Um—

537
00:36:34,276 --> 00:36:36,235
Do you think it's—
Do you think it's possible...

538
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,654
for somebody that had
problems all their life—

539
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,532
You know, not to stay that way?

540
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,909
- You know, you think
it's possible they can change?
- Absolutely.

541
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:46,745
- Why do you ask?
- No reason.

542
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,998
- You want something to drink?
- No. I'm good—

543
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:51,667
- Okay.
- sir.

544
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:54,628
Uh— You know, you—

545
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,630
You know, when you
kind of meet somebody-

546
00:36:56,715 --> 00:37:00,551
- You know, if you have problems, it wouldn't—
- Who is she?

547
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:03,345
What's her name?
What's her name?

548
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:06,849
Cheryl. She works at the exchange.

549
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,392
- That's a good thing.
- Uh-huh.

550
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,102
- Keep it navy.
-

551
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:13,355
- Right? So?
- Um, so, um—

552
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:17,151
Have you spoken to her yet?

553
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,320
Yeah, I've spoken to her, but, uh...

554
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:22,364
I get caught up— tongue-tied.

555
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:25,367
- I get caught up-
- Everybody's awkward at first. Okay?

556
00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:28,120
- No, not like me.
- No, everybody is, Antwone. Trust me.

557
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:30,164
- Even you?
- Even me. Everybody.

558
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,291
- Mmm.
- So?

559
00:37:33,335 --> 00:37:35,669
Well, we're goin' out tonight.

560
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:38,923
- Good.
- We were supposed to go out a couple days ago...

561
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:42,760
but, uh, you know,
I just wanted to clear my head.

562
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:46,680
Take some time. You know.
Talk to you first.

563
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:48,807
- Okay.
- Yeah.

564
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:51,769
- So what should I do?
-

565
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:54,521
- Well— She's a nice girl?
- Yeah.

566
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,774
- And obviously you like her.
- Mm-hmm.

567
00:37:56,858 --> 00:38:00,611
Okay. I think you should
just go out with her. I mean—

568
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,613
- Mmm?
- I tell you what.

569
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:05,991
You know, sometimes it helps,
just to take the anxiety...

570
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:08,535
out of a future meeting, to role-play.

571
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:12,247
- What's that?
- Like, you— You play yourself. I'll play Cheryl.

572
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:14,792
I'll ask you some questions.
We'll have a conversation.

573
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:17,002
And you'll see that you
have a good time, okay?

574
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:20,130
- Yeah, you play Cheryl?
- Okay, now. That's right.

575
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:23,133
That's right.
I'm man enough to play Cheryl.

576
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:26,637
Okay. Uh, you go first.

577
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,556
- Nah.
- I'll go first.

578
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:33,018
- Yeah.
- So—

579
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:36,105
- How you doin'?
- Fine.

580
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:38,482
Good. Good.

581
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:41,068
So where we gonna go?

582
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,904
Out.

583
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:48,242
- See?
- Uh—

584
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,746
- I'm hungry. You?
- I can eat.

585
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:55,249
- See? That's good. You got it.
- You think so?

586
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,501
Absolutely. I don't think you have
anything to worry about.

587
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,503
I'm gonna give you my phone number.

588
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:02,006
You have any problems-
any questions at all—

589
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:05,592
you can call me,
any time of day or night.

590
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:10,556
- Have fun. Gimme a call, okay?
- We're gonna be fine.

591
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,433
-  Okay.
- Yeah.

592
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:14,643
You never know, son. These things—
Sometimes they can escalate.

593
00:39:14,728 --> 00:39:16,687
Escalate into what?

594
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:20,065
My wife and I went out.
It escalated into marriage.

595
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,317
- No, we're not escalating into marriage.
-

596
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:24,820
All right. Well, good.
You get out of here. Have fun.

597
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:27,698
Hey, have fun. Okay?

598
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:30,451
- I will.
- Okay. See you later.

599
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,536
No escalating.

600
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,663
- No escalating.
- Okay.

601
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,004
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

602
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:44,006
You're welcome.

603
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,427
- What is this?
- Frappuccino.

604
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:50,888
- Frappuccino.
- Yeah. You like it?

605
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:52,973
- Six dollars?
-

606
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:55,059
What do you care how much it costs?

607
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:57,811
- Aw—
- All the money we're makin'.

608
00:39:57,896 --> 00:40:00,314
That's why I joined
the navy, you know?

609
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,067
See the world, build a fortune.

610
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:05,569
I don't know what to do
with all the money I got.

611
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:09,406
- Okay, now tell my why you really joined the navy.
-

612
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:11,658
- For real?
- Yeah. For real.

613
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:15,037
All right. Well—

614
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:18,373
My father's a navy man.
Vietnam vet.

615
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:21,335
And, uh, his boys were gonna
grow up one day...

616
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,754
and join and serve,
just like he did.

617
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:27,007
Only one little problem.
He didn't have any boys.

618
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:30,052
- So you—
- Mm-hmm. So I.

619
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:32,721
Yep.|

620
00:40:32,806 --> 00:40:35,849
It's worth it. You know?

621
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:38,727
I mean, even if I hated the navy...

622
00:40:38,812 --> 00:40:41,105
which I don't...

623
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:45,067
it's worth just to-just to see
his eyes and the way they shine...

624
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,944
when I put on that uniform.

625
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,824
- So you and him are close?
- Yeah. We're close.

626
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:54,284
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

627
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:58,080
Can't wait to go home
for Thanksgiving.

628
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:00,749
- You goin' home?
- I'm gonna go home.

629
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:03,043
Mmm.

630
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,926
Kind of hungry. How about you?

631
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:14,388
I could eat.|

632
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:17,182
- What?
- Nah.

633
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:19,393
- Nothin'.
-

634
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,644
- What?
- What?

635
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,312
- You sure?
- No.

636
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:25,482
Okay.|

637
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:29,194
- You should have ordered some.
- I just wanted one.

638
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:31,196
These are good—
You know, vegetables.

639
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:33,198
They're good for you.
Wanna try some?

640
00:41:33,283 --> 00:41:35,659
Go on. Try it.

641
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:39,580
It's good. It's got, uh,
white cabbage, purple cabbage.

642
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:41,582
Yellow cabbage.

643
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:45,252
- Nasty cabbage.
-

644
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:51,925
- Man.
- It's not that bad.

645
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,386
Mmm.

646
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,890
So—

647
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:02,394
What do you like to do?
Or what do you want to do?

648
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,396
What would you like to do?

649
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,398
- What would I like to do?
- Mm-hmm.

650
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,442
Uh—

651
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:14,156
I'd like to— I wanna teach.

652
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,324
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

653
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:17,326
- My mother was a teacher.
- For real?

654
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:21,163
- Mm-hmm.
- Hmm. Yeah, teaching is, uh—

655
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:25,167
I think that's a powerful
position, you know.

656
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:28,295
Get to give to kids, and all that.

657
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:31,131
- I think you'll make an excellent teacher.
- Really?

658
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:33,508
Thank you.

659
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:35,510
I think, um—

660
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:39,640
I think you're beautiful.

661
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:43,602
Thank you.

662
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:48,649
- What?
- It's just funny-

663
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:52,736
I mean, nice-
What happens to your—

664
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,738
to your mouth when you smile.

665
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,865
One side curls up higher
than the other.

666
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:59,743
- Did you ever know that?
- No.

667
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:02,329
- It's cute.
- Oh. Thank you.

668
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,331
You shouldn't hide it. You know?

669
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,458
You should smile more often.

670
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,877
It's good for you.

671
00:43:08,962 --> 00:43:10,879
- Yeah.
- Oh.

672
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:18,679
Here we are.

673
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:20,681
- You had a good time?
- Yeah.

674
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:22,683
I had a great time. Thank you.

675
00:43:27,272 --> 00:43:30,315
Well, good night.

676
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,567
Good night.

677
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:41,535
- What is that?
- Japanese.

678
00:43:42,662 --> 00:43:45,622
That meant, "It gave me
a great pleasure...

679
00:43:45,707 --> 00:43:47,916
to spend this evening with you. "

680
00:43:48,001 --> 00:43:49,918
Cool. That was beautiful.

681
00:43:50,003 --> 00:43:52,754
Thank you.

682
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:56,216
So how do they say,
"Maybe we can do this again some time"?

683
00:43:57,719 --> 00:43:59,761
- Uh, I don't know.
-

684
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:04,850
- Let me know.
- I will.

685
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:07,394
Good night.

686
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:12,232
- Hmm.
- Good night.

687
00:44:12,317 --> 00:44:14,401
Good night.

688
00:44:20,033 --> 00:44:23,160
Oh, yeah, I kissed her, man. Shoot!

689
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:26,038
But I ain't— I ain't getting into
all intimate details with you.

690
00:44:26,122 --> 00:44:29,082
For real. That's just how it is.

691
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:31,501
That's my girl.
I respect her. Huh?

692
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:34,796
Mind yours. Mind yours.

693
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:39,217
God, they made me look like a pizza.

694
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:50,354
Hey.

695
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:52,356
Hey.

696
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,858
-  Oh, shoot.
- Hi.

697
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,700
What ya doin'?

698
00:45:03,785 --> 00:45:06,328
- Organizing.
- Organizing.

699
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:08,330
These pile up.

700
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:11,291
Well, you could start off
by getting rid of that one.

701
00:45:11,376 --> 00:45:13,293
- No.
- You'll make the pile a little smaller.

702
00:45:13,378 --> 00:45:15,295
- No, you're gonna have to get in line.
- Yeah?

703
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,297
I remember that one.

704
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:19,966
- You can get rid of that one too.
- No.

705
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:22,177
- Lookit.
- Huh.

706
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:24,763
- Ohhh.
- Lifetime ago.

707
00:45:25,807 --> 00:45:28,141
- Not to me.
- Huh.

708
00:45:32,355 --> 00:45:34,481
Let me see this.

709
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:40,946
What?

710
00:45:43,825 --> 00:45:45,742
How long are we gonna do this?

711
00:45:45,827 --> 00:45:47,994
Are you gonna just keep ignoring me?

712
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,288
Come on, baby. Come on, now.
What are you talking about?

713
00:45:50,373 --> 00:45:53,959
I mean, wh— We're just having
a good time. Why do we—

714
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:56,753
You're just gonna continue to act like
you don't know what I'm talking about?

715
00:45:56,838 --> 00:45:58,880
I don't know what
you're talking about.

716
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,801
- You do know what I'm talking about.
- I'm hungry, you know?

717
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:04,678
I mean, I walk in—

718
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:12,769
- 
- Talk to me.

719
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:16,440
Jerome?

720
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:18,316
She kissed me.

721
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:21,319
- What?
- She kissed me. I didn't even push her.

722
00:46:21,404 --> 00:46:23,864
Only thing I did was, I walked her
to her door, I threw some Japanese on...

723
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:26,408
- and then she kissed me.
- Listen, Seaman Fisher.

724
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:29,077
Sir, I'm sorry for knocking
on your door, but I had to.

725
00:46:29,162 --> 00:46:31,079
I had to talk to you.

726
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:34,458
Hello. I'm sorry
for busting in on you like this.

727
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:37,002
- You know, this is highly irregular.
- I don't know what I'm gonna do.

728
00:46:37,086 --> 00:46:39,254
We're getting under way
to Mexico next week...

729
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:41,756
- and I'm starting to get serious with this girl.
- Okay, okay.

730
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:43,675
- She'll be here when you get back.
- How do you know?

731
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:48,180
Because if she has a fraction
of the bounce that you have, she'll be here.

732
00:46:48,264 --> 00:46:51,183
- So you think I should just chill?
- That would be a good suggestion.

733
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:53,727
- Chill. Yes.
- Okay. I won't be doing this again.

734
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,604
- Thank you very much.
-

735
00:46:55,688 --> 00:46:57,481
- Good night.
- Thank you, sir.

736
00:46:57,565 --> 00:46:59,399
You're welcome.

737
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:06,948
- Who was that?
- Patient of mine.

738
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:12,496
He was, uh, on his first date.

739
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:16,500
He was so excited
he couldn't wait to tell me about it.

740
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:18,585
Well, don't cure him.

741
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:47,215
- Yeah!

742
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,849
♪♪

743
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:58,768
♪♪

744
00:49:12,116 --> 00:49:15,285
Show me what you're working with.

745
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:18,163
Show me what you're
working with. Whoo!

746
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:55,909
I don't know about you,
but if my math is right...

747
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:58,078
we're a lady short at this table.

748
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:01,539
You didn't know? My man Fisher
just got himself a girlfriend.

749
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:03,792
- She's in the navy, right, Fish?
- Yeah—

750
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:08,004
Be writing to her every minute
he can find. Just so romantic.

751
00:50:08,089 --> 00:50:10,840
- 
- ¿Quieres bailar?

752
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:13,218
- I don't understand.
- Ah, you understand.

753
00:50:13,302 --> 00:50:16,846
¿Quieres bailar?
Sí. Sí. Bailar.

754
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:18,682
- I don't—
- She wants to mate.

755
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:22,060
- Do the dance. You understand.
-  Come. Come.

756
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:24,396
- Venga. Venga.
- No, I'm fine.

757
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,232
Let her oil the old slave down. What
your girlfriend don't know won't hurt you.

758
00:50:27,316 --> 00:50:30,235
- 
- Hey, come on, man. Get up. Get up.

759
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:32,779
- Nah, I don't want to.
- You don't what?

760
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:38,076
- Why don't you leave him alone, Grayson?
- I'm not gonna bother him.

761
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,412
- Now he can answer my question.
- What question?

762
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:45,375
You don't what? How come
I never seen you with a girl, huh?

763
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:48,795
I mean, man says he's got
a girlfriend, right?

764
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,964
Well, anybody ever met her?

765
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:54,592
Huh? Anybody?

766
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:56,845
Don't worry about it, sweetheart.

767
00:50:57,847 --> 00:51:00,348
You see, he's a cherry boy.

768
00:51:00,433 --> 00:51:03,601
Never been to the sugar shack.
Too scared to go.

769
00:51:03,686 --> 00:51:06,813
- Fuck you, Grayson.
- Huh? What you say?

770
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:09,649
- You heard me.
- Fuck me?

771
00:51:09,734 --> 00:51:11,651
With all these women in here...

772
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:13,778
you want me?

773
00:51:13,863 --> 00:51:17,115
See what I mean, brother?
Hell, I'm worried about you, Fish.

774
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:21,119
I mean, all this action up in here-

775
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:23,329
Why you don't want no woman?

776
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:27,459
Yeah. Faggot.

777
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:31,796
- 
- Here we go again.

778
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:35,300
- 
- Get off! Get off!

779
00:51:44,769 --> 00:51:46,853
Davenport.

780
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:57,113
What time does his plane get in?

781
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:03,453
Okay. No, no. I understand.

782
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:06,372
I understand.

783
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:09,125
Okay, just let me talk to him first.

784
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:11,169
All right, thank you.

785
00:52:28,437 --> 00:52:31,731
- 
-

786
00:52:42,827 --> 00:52:44,702
Thought we were all done
fighting, Antwone.

787
00:52:47,248 --> 00:52:49,207
Let me in.

788
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:57,882
The X. O. wired the statements
of your shipmates.

789
00:52:59,468 --> 00:53:01,427
Now, do you want to start
at the beginning?

790
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:13,731
You're gonna have
to talk to me, son.

791
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:18,862
You better tell me something,
'cause I'm all you got right now.

792
00:53:18,946 --> 00:53:22,282
I'm trying to work things out
with your commanding officer,
but you gotta give me something.

793
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:25,577
- I don't know what to say.
- Just tell me what happened.

794
00:53:25,661 --> 00:53:28,496
- They were frontin' me.
- What do you mean, fronting you?

795
00:53:28,581 --> 00:53:32,500
Some of the guys- They were
baggin' on me, and I couldn't take it.

796
00:53:32,585 --> 00:53:35,003
How so?

797
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:39,173
I don't know. Just, uh—

798
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:43,303
Just makin'— makin' jokes.

799
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:47,307
What kind of jokes?

800
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:53,479
Jokes about me with women.

801
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:56,649
I wasn't taking it.

802
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:01,154
What kind of jokes about you
being with women, Antwone?

803
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:06,159
Jokes like me being a virgin.

804
00:54:09,872 --> 00:54:11,789
Are you?

805
00:54:11,874 --> 00:54:14,834
I don't know. I might be.

806
00:54:14,919 --> 00:54:17,086
Okay.

807
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:19,130
Why do you think
you haven't been with a woman?

808
00:54:29,433 --> 00:54:32,644
Think about it, son.

809
00:54:32,728 --> 00:54:35,855
Must be a reason. I mean, you're...
a good-looking young man.

810
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,899
Must have had many opportunities.

811
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:39,943
Maybe you don't like women.

812
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:41,945
- Do you like men?
- I like women.

813
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:45,031
- Maybe you don't care about sex.
- I care about sex.

814
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:47,033
I think about it all the time.

815
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:49,535
All right, we're right back
where we started.

816
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:53,665
How come you've
never been with a woman?

817
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,752
- I have.
- Okay.

818
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:01,047
When?

819
00:55:03,968 --> 00:55:06,552
- When?
- When I was young.

820
00:55:06,637 --> 00:55:09,055
Was- It was a kiss.

821
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:12,892
Okay. How was it?

822
00:55:12,977 --> 00:55:15,144
I hated it.

823
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:17,230
It was t— It was terrible.

824
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:20,066
- Why?
- I threw up.

825
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,068
Why?

826
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:26,572
Why?

827
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:28,658
Because—

828
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:33,663
Because she put
her tongue in my mouth.

829
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:36,791
She- She always did.

830
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:44,257
- That's my mama.
- That ain't your mama.

831
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:47,301
- You said the other lady was yours.
- I changed.

832
00:55:47,386 --> 00:55:49,846
- You changed?
- Boy, you can't change. That's my mama.

833
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:51,848
Nigga?

834
00:55:51,932 --> 00:55:54,017
- Nigga, you hear me callin' you?
- That's you.

835
00:55:54,101 --> 00:55:56,185
- I said nigga.
- Comin', m'dear.

836
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:59,272
- Dwight? Keith?
- Yes, m'dear. Here.

837
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:02,525
- Here I come.
- Get your behinds down here.

838
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:05,987
And I told you-all
not to mess up your clothes.

839
00:56:07,698 --> 00:56:09,615
- Nadine.
-  Yes.

840
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,784
We're gonna be downtown
at the social service office.

841
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:15,747
- All right.
- Twonny, you stay with Nadine.

842
00:56:15,831 --> 00:56:17,915
Yes, m'dear.

843
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:40,480
Don't you say nothin' unless I tell you to.

844
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:56,829
Twonny, what you
lookin' at out there?

845
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:01,000
Hmm?

846
00:57:01,085 --> 00:57:03,002
What you lookin' at?

847
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:14,555
That's it.

848
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:23,606
Gimme some sugar.

849
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:35,201
Now get on downstairs.

850
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:40,206
What did I say?
Get on downstairs-

851
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,375
In that basement and drop 'em.

852
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:59,642
Hurry up.

853
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:03,229
Unbutton them all. Come on.

854
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:05,231
- I said come on.
-

855
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,818
Pull 'em down.

856
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:11,612
You heard me. Pull 'em down.
Pull 'em right over my feet.

857
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:16,409
Now, get over here close. Closer.

858
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:19,453
You don't have to be afraid.

859
00:58:19,538 --> 00:58:21,747
Now touch me.

860
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:24,208
You know you wanna.

861
00:58:24,293 --> 00:58:27,420
Yeah, that's it. Kiss me.

862
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:30,298
Come on. I said kiss me.

863
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:35,219
- Baby, gimme some sugar.
-

864
00:58:35,304 --> 00:58:37,680
♪ Mack, Mack, Mack, She asked her mother ♪

865
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:41,100
- ♪ Mother, mother- ♪♪
- Antwone! Oh, I'm gonna tell on you.

866
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:43,269
- 
-

867
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:59,410
What's up, man? You all right?

868
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:02,455
Come on in.

869
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,594
All right?

870
00:59:20,641 --> 00:59:22,975
She did it again?

871
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:27,939
She hit you too?

872
00:59:31,902 --> 00:59:34,862
It's okay, Antwone.
You can stay here.

873
00:59:34,947 --> 00:59:36,864
I'll look after you. Come on.

874
00:59:36,949 --> 00:59:38,866
Come on. Let's get you a shirt.

875
00:59:46,667 --> 00:59:49,794
She made me—
She made me do these things.

876
00:59:53,507 --> 00:59:56,008
And I was only a little boy.

877
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:04,141
If there was something I wouldn't do,
she would beat me.

878
01:00:04,226 --> 01:00:07,144
And Jesse was the only one you ever told?

879
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:10,106
Yes, sir.

880
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:14,819
She's the only woman
I ever seen naked.

881
01:00:14,903 --> 01:00:17,488
I'm almost 25 years old.

882
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:23,953
I never done it.

883
01:00:24,955 --> 01:00:27,164
It's embarrassin'.

884
01:00:29,084 --> 01:00:31,085
I hate it.

885
01:00:43,515 --> 01:00:45,891
- 
-

886
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:57,903
Yes, can I help you with something?

887
01:00:57,988 --> 01:01:00,364
Hello, Mrs. Davenport.
I'm Seaman Fisher.

888
01:01:00,449 --> 01:01:02,742
- Antwone Fisher, ma'am.
- What can I do for you?

889
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:06,370
I'm here to see the commander. I'm one of
his patients. He told me to meet him here.

890
01:01:06,455 --> 01:01:10,249
Well, he's not home yet. But, um—

891
01:01:11,585 --> 01:01:14,754
Well, come on inside.
You can wait.

892
01:01:21,136 --> 01:01:24,347
- Would you like some cider?
- Sure. Thank you.

893
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:28,726
Seems you gettin' all ready
for Thanksgiving, ma'am.

894
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:32,396
Don't call me ma'am. You're gonna
make me feel old. Call me Berta.

895
01:01:32,481 --> 01:01:34,982
So, are you going home
for the holidays?

896
01:01:35,067 --> 01:01:38,861
No, but the chief cook on the ship, he's
plannin' a big meal. So I'll be there for that.

897
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:41,697
That sounds nice. Here you go.

898
01:01:41,782 --> 01:01:44,200
Thank you very much.

899
01:01:44,284 --> 01:01:46,452
Um, first thing I saw...

900
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:50,456
first time I was in his office—
It was you.

901
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,708
Yeah. It was your picture.

902
01:01:52,793 --> 01:01:55,169
I thought you had a nice face...

903
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:59,006
a good face, and... maybe he's all right
if he married a woman like you.

904
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:03,969
-  You ready to get started?
- Yes, sir.

905
01:02:06,515 --> 01:02:09,725
- Nice meetin' you.
- It was very nice to meet you too.

906
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:11,977
Okay.

907
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:18,943
I was just tryin' to be nice.

908
01:02:19,027 --> 01:02:22,696
Why don't you try bein'
nice on that ship? Hmm?

909
01:02:22,781 --> 01:02:25,074
Have a seat.

910
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:31,580
- I like your house.
- Thank you. Tell me about your house.

911
01:02:31,665 --> 01:02:35,459
- Your house, the day you left your family.
- Sir?

912
01:02:35,544 --> 01:02:37,753
The Tates. When they threw you out.
Tell me about that.

913
01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:40,965
Oh. It was back to the orphanage.

914
01:02:41,049 --> 01:02:43,008
Um, they, uh—

915
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:46,512
They told me I needed
to develop my social skills.

916
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:51,559
Nobody was into adoptin' teenage boys.

917
01:02:51,643 --> 01:02:56,230
Uh, they sent me to a reform school
in Pennsylvania.

918
01:02:56,314 --> 01:02:58,816
That's where I got
my excellent skills I have now.

919
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:01,610
Hmm. What then?

920
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:04,488
Um, I was on my own.

921
01:03:04,573 --> 01:03:08,117
The social worker-
She took me to a— a men's shelter.

922
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:11,203
She gave me $67, and, uh...

923
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:13,831
she said good-bye.

924
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:16,959
How long were you at the shelter?

925
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:19,378
- Just till the next mornin'.
- And?

926
01:03:20,964 --> 01:03:23,632
I slept on a few park benches,
and I came here.

927
01:03:23,717 --> 01:03:26,594
- To my house?
- No, sir.

928
01:03:26,678 --> 01:03:29,054
I joined the navy.

929
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:35,352
That's it. I mean, that's
the Antwone Fisher story.

930
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:40,441
Okay. That is it.

931
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:43,235
- You're done for today.
- Okay, sir.

932
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,738
Don't talk to my wife
anymore either. You hear me?

933
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:47,907
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

934
01:04:02,714 --> 01:04:04,673
-  Seaman Fisher.
- Sir?

935
01:04:04,758 --> 01:04:08,385
- Get up here.
- What I do?

936
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:11,764
Cut the jawjackin'.
Up here right now.

937
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:15,267
I don't know what you think
you're up to, but you better be careful.

938
01:04:15,352 --> 01:04:17,853
- I didn't do anything.
- You didn't do anything?

939
01:04:17,938 --> 01:04:20,272
- You didn't do anything?
- I didn't do anything.

940
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:24,068
My wife is inviting you to Thanksgiving.
She thinks you're very charming.

941
01:04:24,152 --> 01:04:27,279
Do you have any idea where
she might've gotten that impression?

942
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:29,907
- 
- Huh? Look at me when I'm talkin' to you.

943
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:32,743
No, sir. Maybe she responds
to nice people.

944
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:35,788
Okay, nice people. Next Thursday,
Thanksgiving, my house...

945
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:37,873
my family, my dinner table, 1400.

946
01:04:37,958 --> 01:04:40,000
- Don't be late.
- Yes, sir.

947
01:04:40,085 --> 01:04:42,753
Get outta here.

948
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:49,426
- 
-  It's nice out here.

949
01:04:49,511 --> 01:04:52,221
- How'd you find this place?
- It's a lighthouse.

950
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:54,890
I'm a sailor. It found me.

951
01:04:54,975 --> 01:04:58,060
- 
- You knucklehead.

952
01:04:58,144 --> 01:05:00,062
You come out here a lot?

953
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:02,815
Sometimes I come
out here to think...

954
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:05,276
or to work out some problems.

955
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:08,112
Mmm. I know what you mean.

956
01:05:10,574 --> 01:05:13,576
Well, um—|

957
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:16,745
Can I be honest with you?

958
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:19,999
- Yeah.
-

959
01:05:23,003 --> 01:05:25,379
Remember when I, uh—

960
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:29,174
I told you that I was-

961
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:32,386
I was workin' on
that important paper?

962
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:34,555
Yeah.|

963
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:36,724
Well, I lied.

964
01:05:36,808 --> 01:05:38,642
I know.

965
01:05:38,727 --> 01:05:41,103
- You know?
- Yeah.

966
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:43,230
You're seein' a psychiatrist, aren't you?

967
01:05:43,315 --> 01:05:46,692
Oh. You knew.

968
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:49,820
- Yeah, I knew. It wasn't that hard to figure out.
- Mmm.

969
01:05:51,156 --> 01:05:54,575
- Are you tryin' to tell me I'm crazy?
- No.

970
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:58,078
So?

971
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:02,291
So I'll understand if you—

972
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:04,710
if you don't wanna
be bothered no more.

973
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:08,839
You're not the only person
that's seen a shrink before.

974
01:06:08,923 --> 01:06:10,966
- Oh, you seen one?
- No...

975
01:06:11,051 --> 01:06:14,303
but I told you
my dad's a Vietnam vet.

976
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:16,680
He has.

977
01:06:16,765 --> 01:06:19,224
I guess he made it, huh?

978
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:25,064
So, why- why are you
seein' a psychiatrist?

979
01:06:26,358 --> 01:06:28,692
My life before the navy
was kind of complicated.

980
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:32,905
- I was feelin' ashamed.
- Of what?

981
01:06:34,908 --> 01:06:36,992
Of bein' unwanted.

982
01:06:39,204 --> 01:06:41,538
And, uh...

983
01:06:41,623 --> 01:06:44,083
I didn't have no parents.

984
01:06:46,169 --> 01:06:48,337
- Mmm.
- You know, I was-

985
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:51,173
I was afraid to even approach you.

986
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:57,930
Would you believe...

987
01:06:58,014 --> 01:07:01,308
that I was too shy to approach you?

988
01:07:03,144 --> 01:07:05,854
- No.
- Yeah.

989
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:08,273
Um, until I realized
you were stalking me.

990
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:10,901
-  I wasn't stalking you.
-

991
01:07:14,614 --> 01:07:18,534
Well, if there's anything
I could do to help...

992
01:07:18,618 --> 01:07:20,661
I'm here.

993
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:23,497
You're doin' it already.

994
01:07:23,581 --> 01:07:26,166
What am I doin'?

995
01:07:26,251 --> 01:07:28,293
Just bein' you.

996
01:07:39,347 --> 01:07:43,684
Happy Thanksgiving. Um—

997
01:07:43,768 --> 01:07:46,228
Happy Thanksgiving.
Happy holidays, sir.

998
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:48,564
Happy holidays, ma'am.

999
01:07:48,648 --> 01:07:51,316
I know.

1000
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:53,819
It's... Berta.

1001
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:56,780
Yeah. Come on— Come on in.

1002
01:08:00,285 --> 01:08:03,495
Hello. I'm Antwone.|

1003
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:05,581
I, um—

1004
01:08:05,665 --> 01:08:07,750
Yeah, I'm hungry.

1005
01:08:07,834 --> 01:08:09,752
I could eat.|

1006
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:13,839
1400, huh? What took you so long?

1007
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:16,633
- Oh, I stopped by to get some cider, sir.
- Okay. Good.

1008
01:08:16,718 --> 01:08:18,761
- Happy holidays.
- Thank you. Come on in.

1009
01:08:18,845 --> 01:08:21,221
Everybody's here waitin' for you.
We're about to say grace.

1010
01:08:21,306 --> 01:08:24,016
All right, everybody. This is Antwone.
Antwone, this is my family.

1011
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:26,018
- Hello.
- That's my mother Johnny Mae.

1012
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:28,604
- That's my wife's brother, Uncle Duke.
- How you doin'?

1013
01:08:28,688 --> 01:08:31,648
- Hello.
- This is my dad, Howard. That's my sister, Gwen.

1014
01:08:31,733 --> 01:08:34,568
- How you doing?
- And her full-grown daughter.

1015
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:37,112
- Hi, Antwone.
- Oh, you wanna come and sit next to her?

1016
01:08:37,197 --> 01:08:40,574
Gwen, Gwen. Come on, baby.
You come on over here and sit.

1017
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:44,578
- Okay.
-

1018
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:46,789
All right.

1019
01:08:46,873 --> 01:08:48,791
Duke, why don't you
lead us in prayer?

1020
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:52,294
Okay. Everybody join hands.

1021
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:54,671
Let's bow our heads.

1022
01:08:54,756 --> 01:08:57,216
Heavenly Father...

1023
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:00,719
we come to you on bent knee
and body bowed...

1024
01:09:00,804 --> 01:09:03,263
as humble as we know how.

1025
01:09:03,348 --> 01:09:07,643
We are grateful for this opportunity to
share another Thanksgiving Day as a family.

1026
01:09:07,727 --> 01:09:12,314
We thank you for our health,
O Lord, and for our friends...

1027
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:14,942
who honor us with their presence.

1028
01:09:15,026 --> 01:09:19,571
We also pray for peace
in the world and in our lives. Amen.

1029
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:23,158
-  Amen.
- All right.

1030
01:09:23,243 --> 01:09:25,369
This looks good. Yeah!

1031
01:09:36,047 --> 01:09:39,216
- Here you go, Daddy.
- Thank you. Mmm.

1032
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:41,885
- Honey, you want some more turkey?
- Oh, no, thank you, ma'am.

1033
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:44,763
Oh, don't be actin' all bashful around me.

1034
01:09:44,848 --> 01:09:47,516
Especially at the dinner table.

1035
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,477
- Dad, leave that boy alone.
- Shoot!

1036
01:09:50,562 --> 01:09:52,521
- Huh?
- I'm okay.

1037
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:56,483
All right, then, let me see you dig in.
I mean, the food is free.

1038
01:09:56,568 --> 01:10:01,363
- Howard.
- You know, when I was in
the service back in the war-

1039
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:03,615
that was before you was born—

1040
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:05,617
Howard!

1041
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:08,704
Anyway, I spent the holidays
in Europe on guard duty, and I— Oh!

1042
01:10:08,788 --> 01:10:12,374
I sure did miss my mama's
holiday cookin'. Whoo!

1043
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:14,626
Howard, would you
leave the boy alone?

1044
01:10:14,711 --> 01:10:16,753
- Let him enjoy his dinner.
- I ain't botherin' him.

1045
01:10:16,838 --> 01:10:19,298
- You leave me alone, huh?
- Baby, he wants to eat!

1046
01:10:19,382 --> 01:10:21,884
Oh, no, look.
I'm just talkin' to the boy.

1047
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:24,094
Gwen, give your daddy
some of those greens or somethin'.

1048
01:10:24,178 --> 01:10:27,222
Hey, listen. Let me ask you something.
Where you from?

1049
01:10:27,307 --> 01:10:29,641
-  Cleveland.
- Cleveland. Yeah?

1050
01:10:29,726 --> 01:10:32,352
- Yeah.
- Cleveland.

1051
01:10:32,437 --> 01:10:36,481
I bet you miss your mama's
holiday cookin', don't you? Huh?

1052
01:10:47,368 --> 01:10:49,161
Excuse me.

1053
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:57,920
- Where he goin'?
-  I don't know.

1054
01:10:58,004 --> 01:11:01,256
See? That's what happens
every holiday season.

1055
01:11:01,341 --> 01:11:03,258
What are you looking at me
like that for?

1056
01:11:03,343 --> 01:11:06,178
- Why do you want to do that to the boy?
- Y'all ran the boy outta here!

1057
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:09,181
- That's what happens every holiday!
- I didn't run the boy out.

1058
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:16,355
- You okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.

1059
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:19,524
I just never had a real Thanksgiving
at the Tates' before.

1060
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:22,903
You didn't have a real one
over here either, I guess.

1061
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:25,530
- You have a real nice family.
- Thank you.

1062
01:11:26,866 --> 01:11:29,701
I got this for you
for having me over today.

1063
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:32,079
Oh, you got a gift
for me. Is it money?

1064
01:11:32,163 --> 01:11:34,247
- No.
-

1065
01:11:37,669 --> 01:11:39,795
- Oh, it's a poem.
- Mm-hmm.

1066
01:11:39,879 --> 01:11:42,214
I can't see without my glasses.

1067
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:44,216
Why don't you read it for me?

1068
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:47,344
I'd rather you read it. Please.

1069
01:11:50,598 --> 01:11:54,267
"Who will cry for the little boy...

1070
01:11:54,352 --> 01:11:56,979
"lost and all alone?

1074

Who will cry for
the little boy, Antwone?

1090
01:12:48,114 --> 01:12:51,324
I will.|

1091
01:12:51,409 --> 01:12:54,995
I always do.

1092
01:13:08,342 --> 01:13:11,720
- It's beautiful, Antwone.
- I know. I told you I was good.

1093
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:14,890
Yes, you are. You are good
because you're honest.

1094
01:13:14,974 --> 01:13:17,893
You're more honest than most people,
even in your anger.

1095
01:13:17,977 --> 01:13:20,187
The only thing you're
not honest with yourself about...

1096
01:13:20,271 --> 01:13:22,606
is your need to find your own family.

1097
01:13:22,690 --> 01:13:26,109
- Your natural family.
- I don't feel like I need to look for 'em.

1098
01:13:26,194 --> 01:13:29,571
Mmm. It'd answer
a lot of questions for you.

1099
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:32,324
I don't have any questions.

1100
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:36,369
You're upset with them because
you feel they didn't come to your rescue.

1101
01:13:36,454 --> 01:13:38,789
- Maybe they didn't know.
- How could they not have known?

1102
01:13:38,873 --> 01:13:41,583
That's a question
you need to ask them.

1103
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:45,003
"Regard without ill will
despite an offense. "

1104
01:13:45,088 --> 01:13:47,005
That's Webster's definition
of forgiveness.

1105
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:50,425
- Why do I have to forgive?
- To free yourself...

1106
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:53,887
so that you can get on
with your life.

1107
01:13:58,601 --> 01:14:02,020
Why I gotta go look for my family?
I got you, Doc.

1108
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:18,745
I think that he had a good time tonight.

1109
01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:23,041
- Hmm?
- Antwone. I think that, uh,
he had a good time, don't you?

1110
01:14:23,126 --> 01:14:25,460
Yeah, seemed like it.

1111
01:14:25,545 --> 01:14:28,630
He did the sweetest thing at the door...

1112
01:14:28,714 --> 01:14:31,508
when he was saying good-bye.

1113
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:35,387
He invited me to come
to his ceremony.

1114
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:37,639
You know he's graduating
from his Japanese class.

1115
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:39,975
- Yeah, I know.
- Well, he wants me to come.

1116
01:14:40,059 --> 01:14:43,687
- To be with you.
- What'd you tell him?

1117
01:14:43,771 --> 01:14:45,897
I told him that I would
be honored, Jerome.

1118
01:14:48,734 --> 01:14:50,902
Okay.

1119
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:56,241
Okay.

1120
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:02,581
Congratulations.

1121
01:15:02,665 --> 01:15:04,708
Petty Officer Fisher. Good job.

1122
01:15:04,792 --> 01:15:07,669
- Thank you, commander.
- I was waiting. Cheryl, right?

1123
01:15:07,753 --> 01:15:10,297
- How you doin', Cheryl?
It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Sir.

1124
01:15:10,381 --> 01:15:12,174
- Heard nothin' but good things about you.
- Where's your wife?

1125
01:15:12,258 --> 01:15:15,635
She couldn't make it.
She sends along her congratulations.

1126
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:18,680
- A small gift for you.
- Okay.

1127
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:21,224
"The Philosophy and Opinions
of Marcus Garvey. "

1128
01:15:21,309 --> 01:15:23,685
- Thank you, sir.
- You're welcome.

1129
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:26,188
Is there somewhere
we can talk in private?

1130
01:15:26,272 --> 01:15:28,398
Do you mind?

1131
01:15:28,482 --> 01:15:30,525
- That's fine. I don't mind.
- Okay.

1132
01:15:30,610 --> 01:15:33,278
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, sir.

1133
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:35,363
Come on.

1134
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:39,326
Hello?

1135
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:42,037
-  What's up, Doc?
-

1136
01:15:42,121 --> 01:15:44,998
- How are you?
- I'm good.

1137
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:47,751
Yes, you are, Antwone. You're good.

1138
01:15:47,835 --> 01:15:51,046
I'm hearing nothin' but
good things from your C. O.

1139
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:55,008
Hear that you're gettin' along very well
with your shipmates. I'm proud of you.

1140
01:15:55,092 --> 01:15:59,930
- Thank you, sir.
- Have you thought anymore
about finding your family?

1141
01:16:00,014 --> 01:16:02,724
I don't know. For what?

1142
01:16:02,808 --> 01:16:06,061
Well, I just think that there's really nothing
more important than that, Antwone.

1143
01:16:06,145 --> 01:16:08,772
What are you tryin' to say, sir?

1144
01:16:10,191 --> 01:16:14,319
That I'm proud of you,
that I think you've come a long way.

1145
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:18,657
Okay. You said that. What's wrong?

1146
01:16:18,741 --> 01:16:21,284
There's nothin' wrong.

1147
01:16:23,788 --> 01:16:27,165
You understand,
this is very difficult for me.

1148
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:31,586
- Our sessions have ended.
-

1149
01:16:31,671 --> 01:16:34,297
Now, listen. Just listen to me, all right?

1150
01:16:34,382 --> 01:16:36,508
- I've taken the liberty of-
- What do you mean, they ended?

1151
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:39,803
They ended, son. It's time for you
to move on. You can't stall here.

1152
01:16:39,887 --> 01:16:42,305
- But you and me are workin' out my problems.
- You and me can't work out—

1153
01:16:42,390 --> 01:16:44,599
- You told me we need to figure out my problems.
- Listen to me—

1154
01:16:44,684 --> 01:16:46,518
- Get off me!
-

1155
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:49,479
- Hey, get out! Get out!
- Nobody ever stays! Everybody's always leavin' me!

1156
01:16:49,563 --> 01:16:52,399
People grow. People move on.
You've grown. It's time for you to move on.

1157
01:16:52,483 --> 01:16:55,443
- Hey, my mother left me! My father!
- I understand that.

1158
01:16:55,528 --> 01:16:57,737
- Jesse and you!
- Jesse? What do you mean?

1159
01:16:57,822 --> 01:17:00,490
- We should've never gone, that's what. Jesse!
- Jesse? Tell me something—

1160
01:17:00,574 --> 01:17:03,118
Cowbells ringin' in my fuckin' head!

1161
01:17:03,202 --> 01:17:06,663
- Cowbells? Tell me about the cowbells-
- But I keep trustin' people!

1162
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:10,417
Trustin'—|

1163
01:17:10,501 --> 01:17:14,170
- What happened to Jesse, Antwone?
- Stay away from me.

1164
01:17:14,255 --> 01:17:19,009
Nobody's takin' anything else
away from me no more.

1165
01:17:34,817 --> 01:17:37,819
Who is it?

1166
01:17:39,947 --> 01:17:43,158
Man, I just asked
who was it. Fish! Oh!

1167
01:17:43,242 --> 01:17:47,203
- What's up, dog? What's up with you, man?
- Let go, man.

1168
01:17:47,288 --> 01:17:49,831
- What's goin' on with you, man?
- Hey, man, stop playin'.

1169
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:52,625
- Stop playin'? Don't make me kick your ass now.
- Stop playin'.

1170
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:54,627
- You know you can't fight worth shit.
- Man.

1171
01:17:54,712 --> 01:17:56,713
- What's up with you, man?
- What's up with you?

1172
01:17:56,797 --> 01:17:59,424
Where you been at?
Where you stayin'? What's up?

1173
01:18:02,094 --> 01:18:05,638
- Huh?
- I'm at the men's shelter.

1174
01:18:05,723 --> 01:18:08,308
On Prospect.

1175
01:18:08,392 --> 01:18:10,518
Where you stayin' at, man? For real.

1176
01:18:10,603 --> 01:18:14,022
- I'm on the street.
- What you doin' on the streets, man?

1177
01:18:14,106 --> 01:18:16,691
- I got nowhere else to go, man.
- You ain't got nowhere to go?

1178
01:18:16,776 --> 01:18:18,943
You couldn't come to my house?

1179
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:21,780
No, man. Your mom ain't
gonna let me stay up in here.

1180
01:18:21,864 --> 01:18:23,907
You trippin', man.
She ain't gotta know.

1181
01:18:23,991 --> 01:18:25,909
I mean, she work all day,
sleep all night.

1182
01:18:25,993 --> 01:18:28,370
Besides, there's so many people
stayin' up in this house...

1183
01:18:28,454 --> 01:18:30,789
she wouldn't even know
you're here no way, dog.

1184
01:18:30,873 --> 01:18:34,209
- You can stay here, for real.
- Y'all got something in the refrigerator?

1185
01:18:34,293 --> 01:18:38,671
Yeah, we got something. You hungry?

1186
01:18:38,756 --> 01:18:40,507
- I'm hungry.
- You hungry?

1187
01:18:40,591 --> 01:18:43,218
- Yeah, man. Stop playin'.
- Come in here.

1188
01:18:43,302 --> 01:18:46,971
You smell like you been
on the streets too, man.

1189
01:18:48,808 --> 01:18:53,144
Dang! Slow down, man.
Ain't nobody gonna take your food.

1190
01:18:53,229 --> 01:18:56,189
Hey, you remember that time
Ms. Tate wouldn't let you use her lotion?

1191
01:18:56,273 --> 01:18:58,358
She made you oil up
with old cooking grease instead.

1192
01:18:58,442 --> 01:19:00,985
You walking around all day
smelling like a fried chicken dinner.

1193
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:04,989
You like, "I sho' is hungry!"
Man, that was so funny.

1194
01:19:05,074 --> 01:19:06,991
That had me rolling for real.

1195
01:19:07,076 --> 01:19:09,953
- Not as funny as your mother
chasing you with that brick.
- Oh, okay, okay.

1196
01:19:10,037 --> 01:19:11,955
- You remember that?
- Yeah, I remember that.

1197
01:19:12,039 --> 01:19:13,957
- That was funny.
- Dude, that wasn't funny, man.

1198
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:18,253
I still got the knot
in the back of my head.

1199
01:19:18,337 --> 01:19:20,964
Fish, you know you're
my best friend, right?

1200
01:19:21,048 --> 01:19:23,133
What you want?

1201
01:19:23,217 --> 01:19:25,677
I can't be happy
my dude back on the block?

1202
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:28,680
I can't be happy
you back here at home, man?

1203
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:32,267
- I want you to do something for me, though.
- What?

1204
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:34,561
- Just look out for me.
- Somebody after you?

1205
01:19:34,645 --> 01:19:38,231
Why somebody gotta
be after me, man? Huh?

1206
01:19:38,315 --> 01:19:41,025
I just want you
to look out for me, dude.

1207
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:43,111
- All right.
- You my best friend, right?

1208
01:19:43,195 --> 01:19:45,405
Yeah, man. Stop trippin', man.

1209
01:19:45,489 --> 01:19:47,740
Man, come on. Let's get you
cleaned up and hit the streets.

1210
01:19:47,825 --> 01:19:50,952
Yeah. You know Brenda.
I used to like her.

1211
01:19:51,036 --> 01:19:54,789
The Brenda you used
to like, dog, got about three kids now.

1212
01:19:54,874 --> 01:19:57,792
- Gettin' all "swole. " She big for real, dog.
- ♪♪

1213
01:19:57,877 --> 01:19:59,919
Ain't no little booty
Brenda no more.

1214
01:20:00,004 --> 01:20:01,713
Hey, how's your mother?

1215
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:04,257
Aw, man, she got knocked up.

1216
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:06,342
- For real?
- Yeah.

1217
01:20:12,057 --> 01:20:14,517
It's bad.

1218
01:20:14,602 --> 01:20:17,937
- Go ahead, man. Get you something. I got you.
-

1219
01:20:19,231 --> 01:20:21,399
- 
-

1220
01:20:27,448 --> 01:20:30,325
- 
-

1221
01:20:30,409 --> 01:20:33,286
- Break it off, old man! This ain't no riddle.
- Jess, what you doing?

1222
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:36,372
This ain't nothing you got to figure out.
Hey, hold off, Fish.

1223
01:20:36,457 --> 01:20:38,875
- Hey, you better break off my loot!
- Hey, Jess, man—

1224
01:20:38,959 --> 01:20:41,920
- Look out for me, Fish.
-

1225
01:21:20,209 --> 01:21:23,378
And by the end
of the next day, I was in boot camp.

1226
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:28,508
I always felt like Jesse was
the lucky one, and I envied him for it.

1227
01:21:28,592 --> 01:21:30,510
How could he be
the lucky one? He's dead.

1228
01:21:30,594 --> 01:21:34,430
Yeah, well, he left me,
and he knew he was the only one I had.

1229
01:21:34,515 --> 01:21:38,059
So you're angry at him
because you felt he abandoned you.

1230
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:41,479
Yes. A little bit.

1231
01:21:41,564 --> 01:21:44,065
How is he the lucky one?

1232
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:47,110
'Cause he don't
have to fight no more.

1233
01:21:47,194 --> 01:21:49,696
Neither do you.

1234
01:21:49,780 --> 01:21:53,366
- So, you think I'll make it?
- I think you already have.

1235
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:55,493
What do you think?

1236
01:21:55,578 --> 01:21:58,413
I think, uh...

1237
01:21:58,497 --> 01:22:01,249
maybe in another life or time...

1238
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:03,293
I would have been king.

1239
01:22:23,188 --> 01:22:25,773
When you locate your family...

1240
01:22:25,858 --> 01:22:28,151
I want you to contact me.

1241
01:22:28,235 --> 01:22:31,195
All right? I want to hear all about it.

1242
01:22:33,657 --> 01:22:35,908
Yes, sir.

1243
01:22:38,162 --> 01:22:40,872
I love you, son.

1244
01:22:44,501 --> 01:22:46,961
I love you too.

1245
01:23:20,621 --> 01:23:23,456
- Who's this?
- Guess who.

1246
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:28,002
- Antwone.
- No, this is Phillip Walker, the late-night stalker.

1247
01:23:28,087 --> 01:23:31,381
- Aw.
-

1248
01:23:31,465 --> 01:23:34,300
So—

1249
01:23:34,385 --> 01:23:38,221
I, um— I'm going on leave.

1250
01:23:38,305 --> 01:23:42,809
- When?
- As soon as you put your
request in and come with me.

1251
01:23:42,893 --> 01:23:45,395
You serious?

1252
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:47,105
Yes.

1253
01:23:48,607 --> 01:23:50,525
I just came back.

1254
01:23:50,609 --> 01:23:52,860
They're not gonna let me
leave again this year.

1255
01:23:52,945 --> 01:23:55,905
Can you ask for emergency leave?

1256
01:23:55,989 --> 01:23:58,908
Tell 'em somebody close to you
is in desperate need.

1257
01:24:00,577 --> 01:24:04,330
Cheryl, I— I really want you
to come with me.

1258
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:09,419
I got these, uh, two open tickets.

1259
01:24:11,547 --> 01:24:13,756
To Cleveland.

1260
01:24:13,841 --> 01:24:15,758
You're gonna try and find them.

1261
01:24:15,843 --> 01:24:18,177
Yeah. I need to find them.

1262
01:24:18,262 --> 01:24:20,805
But not without your help.

1263
01:24:23,475 --> 01:24:25,935
All right. Let me see what I can do.

1264
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:44,328
First the light-skinned
girls. They got adopted the quickest.

1265
01:24:44,413 --> 01:24:47,874
Then the light-skinned boys,
and then the dark-skinned girls...

1266
01:24:47,958 --> 01:24:51,586
and then, last but not least,
the dark-skinned boys.

1267
01:24:51,670 --> 01:24:54,172
I'm really sorry.
All birth records since 1980...

1268
01:24:54,256 --> 01:24:56,299
have been moved to Social Services.

1269
01:25:01,388 --> 01:25:05,975
- 
-

1270
01:25:14,902 --> 01:25:17,653
Last contact with your mother?

1271
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:23,117
I was two months old.

1272
01:25:23,202 --> 01:25:26,496
- And with father?
- Never.

1273
01:25:28,373 --> 01:25:30,541
Place of birth.

1274
01:25:30,626 --> 01:25:34,712
Ohio State Correctional
Facility for Women.

1275
01:25:37,049 --> 01:25:39,175
I'll be right back.

1276
01:26:07,496 --> 01:26:10,081
I need you to sign for me.

1277
01:26:14,419 --> 01:26:17,255
- Best of luck, Mr. Fisher.
- Thank you.

1278
01:26:34,106 --> 01:26:36,482
There's nothing in here.

1279
01:26:51,582 --> 01:26:54,625
- Why don't you go see your foster mother?
- Who, Miss Tate?

1280
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:57,837
- Yeah.
- I'm not— I'm— I'm not going back.

1281
01:26:59,631 --> 01:27:03,384
Well, why not? I mean, she might know
something about your family.

1282
01:27:03,468 --> 01:27:05,261
No.

1283
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:04,820
I haven't done this before.

1284
01:29:43,378 --> 01:29:45,629
Take a ride with me.

1285
01:30:38,517 --> 01:30:41,727
If you selling shit,
just keep on walkin'.

1286
01:30:43,730 --> 01:30:45,689
Oh, my God. Is that you, Antwone?

1287
01:30:45,774 --> 01:30:48,192
- Come here, baby.
- Don't touch me.

1288
01:30:48,276 --> 01:30:51,695
Yeah, it's me, and I'm all grown up.

1289
01:30:53,031 --> 01:30:55,658
I'd like to speak to Miss Tate.

1290
01:30:56,868 --> 01:30:59,745
- Well, you want to come in?
- No.

1291
01:30:59,830 --> 01:31:02,665
Would you like to get her?

1292
01:31:08,213 --> 01:31:10,131
'Twon's here.

1293
01:31:10,215 --> 01:31:13,008
Lord have mercy. Where's the child?

1294
01:31:13,093 --> 01:31:16,387
Oh, nigga! Hug my neck.

1295
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:24,645
Oh, nigga.

1296
01:31:24,729 --> 01:31:28,440
I— Don't you know how to come home?
Where you been?

1297
01:31:28,525 --> 01:31:33,404
I came for one thing: whatever
you can tell me about my real family.

1298
01:31:35,031 --> 01:31:37,366
I don't know nothing
about your real peoples.

1299
01:31:37,450 --> 01:31:40,744
A name, number, anything?

1300
01:31:40,829 --> 01:31:43,914
I said I don't know.
Now, come along. Come on.

1301
01:31:43,999 --> 01:31:48,294
I remember everything. Everything!

1302
01:31:48,378 --> 01:31:50,880
You could have helped me.

1303
01:31:50,964 --> 01:31:52,882
But instead, you beat me
to dust. And you—

1304
01:31:52,966 --> 01:31:56,218
- Boy, I don't know what you're talking about—
- Yes, you do. I was 6 years old!

1305
01:31:56,303 --> 01:31:58,596
- Now, you just listen—
- No, you listen to me!

1306
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:02,141
- I think you done forgotten—
- I think you forgotten. I said listen to me.

1307
01:32:02,225 --> 01:32:05,144
This is my time.
You understand me?

1308
01:32:07,355 --> 01:32:11,692
It don't matter...
what you tried to do.

1309
01:32:11,776 --> 01:32:14,069
You couldn't destroy me.

1310
01:32:14,154 --> 01:32:18,240
I'm still standing.
I'm still strong!

1311
01:32:22,329 --> 01:32:24,330
And I always will be.

1312
01:32:46,645 --> 01:32:48,646
Antwone.

1313
01:32:55,987 --> 01:32:58,155
Elkins.

1314
01:33:00,492 --> 01:33:03,744
Your father's name
was Edward Elkins.

1315
01:33:17,008 --> 01:33:19,093
You take Shaker Heights
and East Cleveland...

1316
01:33:19,177 --> 01:33:22,221
and I'm gonna take
Akron and Cleveland.

1317
01:33:25,016 --> 01:33:28,811
- Yeah. 1976.
-

1318
01:33:28,895 --> 01:33:33,274
Hello. Hi, um, I'm looking
for the family of Edward Elkins.

1319
01:33:35,568 --> 01:33:37,611
Edward Elkins.

1320
01:33:46,663 --> 01:33:48,789
Hello.

1321
01:33:48,873 --> 01:33:52,710
- Hi. I'm looking for the family of Edward Elkins.
- No. Edward.

1322
01:33:52,794 --> 01:33:58,299
- E-D-W-A-R-D.
- Yes, Edward.

1323
01:33:58,383 --> 01:34:01,844
What? I'm speaking clearly. You can't—

1324
01:34:01,928 --> 01:34:04,054
- Okay—
- Okay. Well, thank- thank you.

1325
01:34:04,139 --> 01:34:07,933
I'm looking for the family
of an Edward Elkins.

1326
01:34:08,018 --> 01:34:11,687
You should have said that
in the first place. Why- Why you—

1327
01:34:21,698 --> 01:34:24,825
Forget it, man.

1328
01:34:27,996 --> 01:34:30,622
Yeah, well, we're from California.

1329
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:35,294
Yes, it's very nice there.

1330
01:34:35,378 --> 01:34:40,466
Okay, well, thank you
for your help, ma'am. Thank you. Bye.

1331
01:34:40,550 --> 01:34:43,886
- Any luck?
-

1332
01:34:43,970 --> 01:34:45,971
What you got?

1333
01:34:46,056 --> 01:34:48,098
- Chinese.
-

1334
01:35:03,990 --> 01:35:06,033
- Hello?
-  Hello, ma'am.

1335
01:35:06,117 --> 01:35:10,954
- Yes?
- I'm looking for the family of an Edward Elkins.

1336
01:35:12,916 --> 01:35:16,210
Edward? Who is this
calling about Edward?

1337
01:35:16,294 --> 01:35:19,630
My name is Antwone Fisher.
I didn't mean to disturb you.

1338
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:21,882
I'm just trying to locate my family.

1339
01:35:21,966 --> 01:35:26,387
Honey, Edward Elkins
been dead a long time.

1340
01:35:26,471 --> 01:35:30,766
Yes, ma'am, I know, a long time,
but he was my father.

1341
01:35:35,730 --> 01:35:40,067
Wait, wait, wait.
Who is this calling me up out of nowhere?

1342
01:35:40,151 --> 01:35:43,362
- How'd you get this number?
- I got your number out of the phone book.

1343
01:35:43,446 --> 01:35:48,200
I been calling Elkins all day.
Got no reason to lie to you, ma'am.

1344
01:35:48,284 --> 01:35:52,955
Well, honey, Edward never mentioned no—
What's your name again?

1345
01:35:53,039 --> 01:35:55,916
- Antwone.
- Antwone.

1346
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,628
I don't think he knew my mother
was pregnant. She was away in prison.

1347
01:36:01,464 --> 01:36:03,674
- You know how he died?
- Yes, ma'am.

1348
01:36:03,758 --> 01:36:06,343
He was murdered by
one of his girlfriends.

1349
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:09,805
My God.

1350
01:36:09,889 --> 01:36:13,934
Wait. What made you
decide to show up...

1351
01:36:14,018 --> 01:36:16,770
20-some-odd years later
in the middle of the night?

1352
01:36:16,855 --> 01:36:18,939
Mmm, it's a long story.

1353
01:36:19,023 --> 01:36:22,734
But I'm in the navy, and, uh,
I'm stationed on the West Coast.

1354
01:36:22,819 --> 01:36:24,903
I gotta get back in a few days.

1355
01:36:24,988 --> 01:36:28,740
- Well, I-I want you to come
by my house before you go.
- Okay.

1356
01:36:28,825 --> 01:36:31,034
Okay, look. Y-You have a— a pencil?

1357
01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:34,079
- Take down my address.
- Yeah.

1358
01:36:34,164 --> 01:36:39,543
- It's 1089 Drexel.
- 1089 Drexel.

1359
01:36:39,627 --> 01:36:41,837
- You know where that is?
- Yes, ma'am.

1360
01:36:41,921 --> 01:36:44,506
All right, well, come by
my house tomorrow, hear?

1361
01:36:44,591 --> 01:36:46,425
- Okay. Um, ma'am?
- Yes?

1362
01:36:46,509 --> 01:36:48,552
You mind if I bring
my girlfriend with me?

1363
01:36:48,636 --> 01:36:51,221
Yes, fine. I'm-I'm looking
forward to meeting her.

1364
01:36:51,306 --> 01:36:53,599
I'm sure she's looking
forward to meeting you too.

1365
01:36:53,683 --> 01:36:57,978
You— Listen. You know, if-
If Edward was your father...

1366
01:36:58,062 --> 01:37:01,064
then you talking
to your auntie, son.

1367
01:37:01,149 --> 01:37:03,650
You are talking
to your Auntie Annette...

1368
01:37:03,735 --> 01:37:07,070
your daddy's baby sister.|

1369
01:37:07,155 --> 01:37:09,948
- Well, I'll see you tomorrow.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

1370
01:37:10,033 --> 01:37:12,576
- Good night.
- Bye.

1371
01:37:38,978 --> 01:37:41,730
I found them.

1372
01:37:41,814 --> 01:37:45,651
- Hmm?
- I found my family.

1373
01:37:45,735 --> 01:37:47,694
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.

1374
01:37:47,779 --> 01:37:49,738
Oh, baby.

1375
01:37:50,782 --> 01:37:52,741
Mmm.

1376
01:38:03,670 --> 01:38:05,963
I don't know. What do you think?

1377
01:38:06,047 --> 01:38:08,173
Well, he does look like Eddie.

1378
01:38:08,258 --> 01:38:11,218
- I do?
- Yeah, you look just like him.

1379
01:38:11,302 --> 01:38:13,303
Mm-hmm.

1380
01:38:15,139 --> 01:38:18,517
I brought my birth certificate.

1381
01:38:25,567 --> 01:38:29,194
Born in '76.
That's the year Edward died.

1382
01:38:29,279 --> 01:38:32,739
Yeah, he-he died in June,
and I was born in August.

1383
01:38:32,824 --> 01:38:35,659
And your mother's name is-

1384
01:38:35,743 --> 01:38:37,995
- Eva Mae Fisher.
- Eva Mae Fisher.

1385
01:38:38,079 --> 01:38:42,457
Eva? I know Eva.
That's Jess's sister.

1386
01:38:42,542 --> 01:38:44,918
- Who?
- Jess.

1387
01:38:45,003 --> 01:38:47,838
- You mean Fish?
- Yeah, Fish. Jess Fisher.

1388
01:38:47,922 --> 01:38:49,923
The boy's name is Antwone Fisher.

1389
01:38:50,008 --> 01:38:53,260
That’s Jess Fisher's sister, Eva Mae.
You know, Mae-Mae.

1390
01:38:53,344 --> 01:38:56,471
- She live over there on Hodges Street.
- I don't remember no Mae-Mae.

1391
01:38:58,725 --> 01:39:00,892
Y-You know where she lives?

1392
01:39:03,354 --> 01:39:05,355
You don't know her, do you?

1393
01:39:10,028 --> 01:39:12,404
No. I—I—

1394
01:39:12,488 --> 01:39:14,406
No, no.

1395
01:39:14,490 --> 01:39:16,742
You want to meet her?

1396
01:39:17,869 --> 01:39:20,329
Uh—

1397
01:39:25,835 --> 01:39:29,212
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1398
01:39:29,297 --> 01:39:32,174
You sure? 'Cause we can take care
of this right here and now.

1399
01:39:35,887 --> 01:39:38,263
Yeah, I'm sure.

1400
01:39:38,348 --> 01:39:41,099
Let me get my hat.

1401
01:39:48,107 --> 01:39:50,901
Want me to go with you?

1402
01:39:50,985 --> 01:39:54,446
No, why don't you just stay
here with us, baby?

1403
01:39:54,530 --> 01:39:56,365
Okay, let's ride.

1404
01:40:04,749 --> 01:40:07,250
Bye.

1405
01:40:37,031 --> 01:40:40,367
You're not gonna let nothin'
happen to me, are you?

1406
01:40:40,451 --> 01:40:43,412
No, Antwone.
I won't let nothin' happen to you.

1407
01:41:21,743 --> 01:41:24,661
-  Who is it?
- Eva, it's James. James Elkins.

1408
01:41:24,746 --> 01:41:27,414
Edward's brother.

1409
01:41:29,167 --> 01:41:32,419
Did you hear me, Eva? This is James.

1410
01:41:34,130 --> 01:41:37,257
- What you want?
- Can we come in?

1411
01:41:51,689 --> 01:41:54,024
- Hey, Eva.
- Hey.

1412
01:41:56,068 --> 01:41:58,278
It's all right, son. Come on.

1413
01:42:04,035 --> 01:42:08,205
- Who's that, Eva?
- That's Johnny.

1414
01:42:08,289 --> 01:42:11,374
No. That's Antwone Quenton Fisher.

1415
01:42:24,305 --> 01:42:27,015
Who's Antwone Quenton Fisher, Eva?

1416
01:42:31,437 --> 01:42:34,564
That's my firstborn son.

1417
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:40,904
Oh, God.

1418
01:42:47,119 --> 01:42:49,663
There's nothing going on around here.

1419
01:42:51,249 --> 01:42:53,208
You wanna stay?

1420
01:42:53,292 --> 01:42:55,460
I'm gonna stay.

1421
01:42:56,462 --> 01:42:58,964
I'll be in the car.

1422
01:43:39,714 --> 01:43:42,799
- You want something to eat?
- No.

1423
01:43:46,846 --> 01:43:49,723
Why'd you never come for me?

1424
01:43:53,019 --> 01:43:55,437
Didn't you wonder where I was...

1425
01:43:56,480 --> 01:44:00,525
or what I was doing,
or what I'd become...

1426
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:04,863
or even if I was still alive?

1427
01:44:05,948 --> 01:44:07,866
Didn't you?

1428
01:44:26,052 --> 01:44:29,429
I've taken care of myself. I have.

1429
01:44:29,513 --> 01:44:33,350
I've never been
in trouble with the law.

1430
01:44:35,519 --> 01:44:38,521
I've read hundreds of books...

1431
01:44:38,606 --> 01:44:40,649
written poems...

1432
01:44:40,733 --> 01:44:43,526
painted pictures.

1433
01:44:43,611 --> 01:44:46,863
I've traveled the world.

1434
01:44:46,948 --> 01:44:49,032
I serve my country.

1435
01:44:49,116 --> 01:44:51,993
I speak two languages...

1436
01:44:53,537 --> 01:44:55,997
and I'm working on a third.

1437
01:44:58,501 --> 01:45:01,127
I never fathered any children.

1438
01:45:01,212 --> 01:45:04,714
I've never done drugs
or even smoked a cigarette.

1439
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:25,110
I used to dream about you.

1440
01:45:28,197 --> 01:45:32,242
My mother. My mother.

1441
01:45:32,326 --> 01:45:35,328
You know, what you'd be like...

1442
01:45:37,206 --> 01:45:39,374
how you look...

1443
01:45:39,458 --> 01:45:42,043
your voice and your smile...

1444
01:45:42,128 --> 01:45:44,921
even your scent.

1445
01:45:47,091 --> 01:45:51,636
For all these years
I wondered about you.

1446
01:45:51,721 --> 01:45:55,682
I dreamed about you.
Didn't you miss me?

1447
01:45:59,103 --> 01:46:02,022
On the way to school each day...

1448
01:46:02,106 --> 01:46:06,526
I imagined you were just
around the next corner...

1449
01:46:06,610 --> 01:46:10,071
and when I'd get there,
you'd be there.

1450
01:46:11,699 --> 01:46:14,034
And in my mind...

1451
01:46:15,119 --> 01:46:17,495
you was always there.

1452
01:46:17,580 --> 01:46:19,581
You just couldn't find me.

1453
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,710
So I'd race to the next corner...

1454
01:46:24,795 --> 01:46:26,713
and you'd be there.

1455
01:46:26,797 --> 01:46:29,549
I'd know you would.

1456
01:46:29,633 --> 01:46:33,845
Then you would...
buy me ice cream.

1457
01:46:36,307 --> 01:46:39,309
And then you would take me home.

1458
01:46:56,077 --> 01:46:58,536
I'm a good person.

1459
01:46:59,997 --> 01:47:02,499
I'm a good man.

1460
01:48:01,517 --> 01:48:05,937
Hey, boy, how you doin'?
I'm your Uncle Horace.

1461
01:48:06,021 --> 01:48:08,565
Get out of the way, Horace.
Come on, baby. Here he is!

1462
01:48:08,649 --> 01:48:12,318
Oh, look at you! Look at you!
I'm your Aunt Eda, baby.

1463
01:48:12,403 --> 01:48:16,322
Oh, I'm your cousin Jeanette.
Welcome home!

1464
01:48:16,407 --> 01:48:19,576
And I'm your Aunt Anna.
How you doin', baby?

1465
01:48:22,371 --> 01:48:25,623
Oh, my Lord Jesus. Oh, goodness.

1466
01:48:25,708 --> 01:48:28,626
-  This is my wife, T.
- How you doin', good-lookin'?

1467
01:48:28,711 --> 01:48:31,004
I'm your cousin Eddie.
My dad named me after your father.

1468
01:48:31,088 --> 01:48:34,424
- An this is my brother Ray.
- What's up, dog? What's crackin', man?

1469
01:48:34,508 --> 01:48:37,802
Hey, I'm your cousin Jason,
man. Much love. Much love.

1470
01:48:37,887 --> 01:48:39,929
All right, boys, open up.

1471
01:50:05,224 --> 01:50:07,225
Welcome.

1472
01:50:16,068 --> 01:50:18,528
All right.

1473
01:50:18,612 --> 01:50:21,948
- Come on! Let's eat!
-

1474
01:50:24,326 --> 01:50:28,871
You want some pancakes? Ooh.

1475
01:50:31,792 --> 01:50:36,087
Here we go. How about some sausages?

1476
01:51:02,865 --> 01:51:05,325
I'm not a virgin anymore.

1477
01:51:09,496 --> 01:51:12,582
I'm glad to hear that.|

1478
01:51:19,298 --> 01:51:21,215
- How you doin', son?
- I'm great, sir.

1479
01:51:21,300 --> 01:51:23,718
All right. Good. Good, good.
Very good to see you.

1480
01:51:23,802 --> 01:51:26,888
- So?
- I took your advice.

1481
01:51:26,972 --> 01:51:29,724
I found my family
and I found my mother.

1482
01:51:31,143 --> 01:51:33,144
- Good.
- Yeah.

1483
01:51:33,228 --> 01:51:36,314
- So?
- Well, in my heart I forgive her...

1484
01:51:36,398 --> 01:51:38,775
but if I never saw her again—

1485
01:51:38,859 --> 01:51:41,235
I understand.

1486
01:51:41,320 --> 01:51:45,114
It's funny to feel that way
about your mother, but I did it.

1487
01:51:45,199 --> 01:51:48,076
And I owe it to you to tell you
that you were right.

1488
01:51:48,160 --> 01:51:50,495
- You owe it to me?
- Yes, sir.

1489
01:51:50,579 --> 01:51:53,664
- I needed to find her.
- Yeah.

1490
01:51:53,749 --> 01:51:57,085
Well, if I was right, it was
for all the wrong reasons.

1491
01:51:57,169 --> 01:51:59,003
Sir?

1492
01:51:59,088 --> 01:52:01,589
This stays between you and me, okay?

1493
01:52:01,673 --> 01:52:03,633
Yes, sir.

1494
01:52:03,717 --> 01:52:08,179
My wife and I, we were gonna have a bunch
of kids, when we found out we couldn't have any.

1495
01:52:08,263 --> 01:52:10,848
And it rocked her to the core.

1496
01:52:10,933 --> 01:52:15,103
I knew what to do for her
though. She needed help, treatment.

1497
01:52:15,187 --> 01:52:19,357
I made sure she had it. The best
psychiatrist, the one that trained me.

1498
01:52:19,441 --> 01:52:23,403
But I, the well one,
the strong one...

1499
01:52:23,487 --> 01:52:28,157
at the same time I went about
the business of shutting down.

1500
01:52:28,242 --> 01:52:32,995
Very subtle, very quiet.
It was my little secret.

1501
01:52:33,080 --> 01:52:38,292
Until one day, a young man came
into my office and into my life...

1502
01:52:38,377 --> 01:52:42,088
and he blew up that little secret...
right in my face.

1503
01:52:42,172 --> 01:52:47,009
And he put me to shame in a way
I never thought possible.

1504
01:52:48,512 --> 01:52:52,640
Because of you, Antwone,
I'm a better doctor...

1505
01:52:52,724 --> 01:52:56,352
and I'm learning
to be a better husband.

1506
01:52:57,354 --> 01:53:01,441
You don't owe me anything.
I owe you.

1507
01:53:01,525 --> 01:53:03,443
You're the champ, son.

1508
01:53:03,527 --> 01:53:06,320
You've beaten everybody
who was beatin' you.

1509
01:53:07,698 --> 01:53:09,866
I salute you.

1510
01:53:14,621 --> 01:53:16,873
You hungry, sailor?

1511
01:53:16,957 --> 01:53:18,875
I could eat, sir.

1512
01:53:21,712 --> 01:53:23,754
Let's go.

1513
01:53:35,350 --> 01:53:36,976
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

1514
01:53:37,060 --> 01:53:38,644
- All the way.
- All the way.

1515
01:53:38,729 --> 01:53:40,354
