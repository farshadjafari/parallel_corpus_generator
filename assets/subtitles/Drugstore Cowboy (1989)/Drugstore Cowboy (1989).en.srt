00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:07,973
<i>I was once a shameless,
full-time dope fiend.</i>

3
00:01:09,399 --> 00:01:11,855
<i>Yeah, me
- Bob. The sweet mother's son.</i>

4
00:01:13,945 --> 00:01:16,021
<i>Me and my crew robbed drugstores.</i>

5
00:01:16,155 --> 00:01:19,073
<i>I had done 'em all,
up and down the Pacific Northwest,</i>

6
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,442
<i>with pharmacies open or closed.</i>

7
00:01:21,577 --> 00:01:24,246
<i>It didn't matter.
Except for technique.</i>

8
00:01:25,998 --> 00:01:28,667
<i>But don't get the idea it was easy.</i>

9
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:34,038
<i>It's hard being a dope fiend. And
it's even harder running a crew.</i>

10
00:01:36,591 --> 00:01:38,667
<i>Dianne was my wife.</i>

11
00:01:39,093 --> 00:01:42,177
<i>I loved her. Man, did she love dope.</i>

12
00:01:43,681 --> 00:01:45,757
<i>So we made a good couple.</i>

13
00:01:45,891 --> 00:01:49,805
<i>Whenever I got out of the joint
I always ended up with Dianne.</i>

14
00:01:50,896 --> 00:01:54,099
<i>Rick was my sidekick. My muscle.</i>

15
00:01:55,025 --> 00:01:57,231
<i>He was no novice to
the life of crime.</i>

16
00:01:58,194 --> 00:02:02,523
<i>His record showed a steady climb from
juvenile offender to small-time thief.</i>

17
00:02:02,657 --> 00:02:05,112
<i>He was gonna do just fine.</i>

18
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:12,034
<i>Nadine was Rick's old lady.
A counter girl he picked up during one of our jobs.</i>

19
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:14,455
<i>She was a piece of work.</i>

20
00:02:14,584 --> 00:02:20,088
<i>She had no record. Just a smile
that caught us all a little off guard.</i>

21
00:02:20,215 --> 00:02:22,124
<i>I was the undisputed leader then.</i>

22
00:02:22,258 --> 00:02:27,050
<i>I carried the whole goddamn outfit on
my back like it was my own newborn son.</i>

23
00:02:29,014 --> 00:02:31,470
<i>But I guess, deep down,</i>

24
00:02:32,142 --> 00:02:34,265
<i>I knew we could never win.</i>

25
00:02:35,228 --> 00:02:37,802
<i>We played a game we couldn't win...</i>

26
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:39,979
<i>to the utmost.</i>

27
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,029
Good morning. I like your hat.

28
00:04:41,845 --> 00:04:44,929
- Do you have wintergreen gum?
- I don't think we carry that.

29
00:04:47,684 --> 00:04:49,723
Hey!

30
00:04:51,562 --> 00:04:55,726
Hey! Come out here!
This lady's having a fit! Hey!

31
00:04:56,901 --> 00:04:59,652
Come on, she's bouncing
all over the place!

32
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:02,318
Come on!

33
00:05:07,702 --> 00:05:10,275
I think she might swallow her tongue.

34
00:05:11,331 --> 00:05:14,165
Look at that. She's turning blue!

35
00:05:17,753 --> 00:05:21,537
Excuse me. Are you too busy to
take some money for cough syrup?

36
00:05:21,882 --> 00:05:23,376
Just a minute, ma'am.

37
00:05:23,508 --> 00:05:26,379
Wait a minute, man.
She's foaming here.

38
00:05:35,603 --> 00:05:39,647
I need an ambulance. A woman
is having an epileptic seizure.

39
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:46,900
- So how'd we do?
- So-so.

40
00:05:57,915 --> 00:05:59,457
Are you sure you're OK?

41
00:06:05,923 --> 00:06:08,460
Hey! Let's go. Come on.

42
00:06:09,092 --> 00:06:10,670
Hurry up.

43
00:06:12,053 --> 00:06:15,422
- I told you to walk, not crawl.
- You said walk and that's what we did.

44
00:06:15,556 --> 00:06:18,972
Yeah, I said walk, but I didn't
mean to go window-shopping.

45
00:06:26,233 --> 00:06:28,060
Goddamnit, Bob.

46
00:06:28,193 --> 00:06:31,893
Why do you gotta fix in the car?
Can't you wait till we get home?

47
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,485
Shut up and watch your drivin'.

48
00:06:35,992 --> 00:06:39,574
Christ. Look at
this traffic up here. Shit.

49
00:06:39,704 --> 00:06:42,823
We gotta get home. Idiot, move over!

50
00:06:48,045 --> 00:06:52,208
<i>After any kind of drug haul,
everyone in the crew indulged.</i>

51
00:06:53,049 --> 00:06:56,714
<i>I laughed to myself as I pictured blues
or Dilaudid in such great amounts</i>

52
00:06:56,844 --> 00:07:00,296
<i>that the spoon would
literally be overflowing.</i>

53
00:07:02,058 --> 00:07:05,509
<i>Upon entering my vein
the drug would start a warm itch</i>

54
00:07:05,644 --> 00:07:09,807
<i>that would surge along until the brain
consumed it in a gentle explosion</i>

55
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:14,020
<i>that began in the back of
the neck and rose rapidly</i>

56
00:07:14,152 --> 00:07:16,939
<i>until I felt such pleasure
that the world sympathised</i>

57
00:07:17,071 --> 00:07:19,823
<i>and took on a soft and lofty appeal.</i>

58
00:07:21,325 --> 00:07:23,697
<i>Everything was grand then.</i>

59
00:07:23,828 --> 00:07:26,497
<i>Your worst enemy, he wasn't so bad.</i>

60
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:31,957
<i>The ants in the grass, they were
just, you know, doin' their thing.</i>

61
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:35,786
<i>Everything took on the rosy
hue of unlimited success.</i>

62
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:42,260
<i>You could do no wrong. And as long
as it lasted, life... was beautiful.</i>

63
00:07:46,307 --> 00:07:48,346
Goddamnit.

64
00:07:49,143 --> 00:07:51,515
Oh, screw you, buddy. Move over.

65
00:07:54,648 --> 00:07:57,352
Where'd you get your goddamn licence?

66
00:07:57,484 --> 00:07:59,310
Shithead!

67
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:15,993
All right, now, everybody just act cool.
Like we just got back from church.

68
00:08:45,695 --> 00:08:48,020
Has anybody seen my lighter?

69
00:08:49,156 --> 00:08:53,699
So, I was working for
this guy out in Valdez.

70
00:08:57,497 --> 00:09:00,700
And I had this great idea to...

71
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:11,130
You just put shit on it, and water.

72
00:09:31,987 --> 00:09:34,822
- Nadine?
- Give me the same as Rick, I guess.

73
00:09:36,408 --> 00:09:37,819
I don't think so.

74
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:41,991
- Why not?
- You can't shoot no goddamn blue.

75
00:09:43,206 --> 00:09:47,749
Give her half of one, Bob. That'll
keep her in the crapper all afternoon.

76
00:09:48,628 --> 00:09:52,755
Goddamnit. I was in there just like you.
I ought to get the same as everyone else,

77
00:09:52,882 --> 00:09:54,921
even if I can't shoot it all right now.

78
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:59,261
That ain't the way things work around
here, Nadine. I mean, you don't do shit.

79
00:10:00,847 --> 00:10:02,804
It's me that's taking the big risk.

80
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:09,439
What about Dianne?
She didn't do anything either.

81
00:10:09,564 --> 00:10:11,390
Really?

82
00:10:11,524 --> 00:10:15,438
That what you think? Don't
give her a goddamn thing, Bob.

83
00:10:15,569 --> 00:10:18,025
Kick her out in the street
where we found her.

84
00:10:18,155 --> 00:10:20,610
No, no. Fair is fair.

85
00:10:20,741 --> 00:10:23,410
You want your fourth. You got it, Nadine.

86
00:10:24,703 --> 00:10:28,451
But I ain't takin' on no apprentices
and givin' 'em a full end of my thing.

87
00:10:28,581 --> 00:10:30,408
You take it...

88
00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:33,498
and you get out.

89
00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:39,209
Nadine, just take your half of blue,
shoot it, and go puke awhile.

90
00:10:43,887 --> 00:10:45,926
Sh.

91
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:50,089
Everybody just act cool. Nadine,
pick up... Come on! Pick up the drugs.

92
00:10:50,226 --> 00:10:52,764
Rick, get your gun.
Get in the bedroom. Back me up.

93
00:10:56,732 --> 00:10:59,982
It's David. It's just David.
David, what do you want?

94
00:11:00,819 --> 00:11:03,440
I just want to see you
for a minute. Let me in.

95
00:11:03,572 --> 00:11:05,114
- You alone?
- Yes.

96
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,403
Did you think I brought my rat-faced
granny along to hold my hand?

97
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,614
David, you're an asshole.

98
00:11:17,251 --> 00:11:21,462
What the hell, pard? Have you finally
gone completely crazy or something?

99
00:11:21,964 --> 00:11:23,506
What the fuck do you want?

100
00:11:23,924 --> 00:11:27,090
- What are you holdin'?
- I ain't holdin' diddly, small fry.

101
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:30,919
I was just thinking about going by
your place to see if you had any speed.

102
00:11:31,055 --> 00:11:33,973
Yeah, well, I got some speed.

103
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,634
Really? Come on inside. You little fucker.

104
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:45,105
Aw, come on, Rick.

105
00:11:46,903 --> 00:11:49,940
All right, you say you got speed?
What kind of speed?

106
00:11:50,073 --> 00:11:53,857
I got crystal Methedrine.
This shit is good, man.

107
00:11:53,993 --> 00:11:56,662
I've been up all night on the stuff.

108
00:11:57,538 --> 00:12:00,455
Here, man. Try one on the house.

109
00:12:03,877 --> 00:12:06,202
How much of this shit
you got on you right now?

110
00:12:06,338 --> 00:12:07,500
I got 10 grams.

111
00:12:10,091 --> 00:12:14,089
Let me talk to Dianne. Why don't you
sit back and watch a little TV?

112
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,260
All right.

113
00:12:22,728 --> 00:12:26,311
Baby? This kid out here
says he's got speed.

114
00:12:28,859 --> 00:12:32,144
What do you want speed for?
You know how ringy it makes you.

115
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:36,691
I know. But listen. What night is it
tonight? It's Saturday night, right?

116
00:12:36,824 --> 00:12:40,869
Let's get some speed. We'll fix up,
then we'll go hit that big fat pharmacy.

117
00:12:40,995 --> 00:12:44,079
You know the one. Right next
to the unemployment office.

118
00:12:44,206 --> 00:12:47,409
Baby, you know how these things go.
It's like a crap game.

119
00:12:47,543 --> 00:12:51,920
When you're hot, you shoot the works.
When you're cold, you lay off a bit.

120
00:12:52,047 --> 00:12:55,250
Well, right now, baby,
I'm so hot, I'm burnin' up all over.

121
00:12:55,383 --> 00:12:56,961
All right, buster.

122
00:12:57,093 --> 00:13:01,589
If you're so damn hot, why don't you lay
me down right now and make love to me?

123
00:13:01,722 --> 00:13:05,850
- Come on. You know what I mean.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

124
00:13:06,435 --> 00:13:08,890
<i>So, did you watch I Spy last night?</i>

125
00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:11,686
<i>No, I watched Outer Limits.</i>

126
00:13:12,107 --> 00:13:16,650
I'm hot to steal. Shoot,
we could do that any time. Come on.

127
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:20,365
Besides, we got company.

128
00:13:23,326 --> 00:13:26,196
So, do you think you could get me a TV?

129
00:13:26,328 --> 00:13:28,202
- Yeah, I could.
- Colour?

130
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:31,117
<i>Yeah, but what could
you do for me, man?</i>

131
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,665
How about some Valium, man?
You look like you could use it.

132
00:13:34,794 --> 00:13:37,499
- Ten milligrams. 60 Valium.
- That's cool.

133
00:13:38,047 --> 00:13:40,087
Well, listen.

134
00:13:41,884 --> 00:13:43,924
Don't tell Bob.

135
00:13:44,053 --> 00:13:46,722
I won't tell Bob. Fuck that guy.

136
00:13:48,474 --> 00:13:50,680
Hey, twerpy. We're gonna fix you up now.

137
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:52,636
You guys got any blues?

138
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:58,012
Blues? Me? Hell, no. You know how hard
it is to get blues these days, David.

139
00:13:58,858 --> 00:14:01,479
How about some morphine?
I got good old morphine.

140
00:14:01,611 --> 00:14:03,899
What'd you get, man?
Morphine sulphate?

141
00:14:04,197 --> 00:14:08,574
You're crazy, man, cos I can't even
read a stop sign when I'm on that crap.

142
00:14:08,701 --> 00:14:11,370
My eyes get so far out of focus.

143
00:14:11,787 --> 00:14:15,701
Besides, I'm not trading no uptown
crank for no downtown trash.

144
00:14:15,832 --> 00:14:19,699
What can I say? That's all
I got. That's all I can give.

145
00:14:22,213 --> 00:14:24,253
That's bullshit, man.

146
00:14:25,258 --> 00:14:28,792
You guys think I'm dumb.
I'm not as dumb as you think I am.

147
00:14:30,471 --> 00:14:33,970
Hey, David? Too bad
we couldn't do business, pal.

148
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,845
All right, man. Fuck. I'm sorry, OK?

149
00:14:41,356 --> 00:14:44,641
- I didn't mean any of that.
- It's OK. It's all right.

150
00:14:44,776 --> 00:14:49,484
So how many quarter grains of that
morphine are you gonna give me for this?

151
00:14:50,239 --> 00:14:54,735
I'll hit you with nine quarters per package,
and that's just cos I'm feeling good.

152
00:14:54,952 --> 00:14:59,329
And because you're a real stand-up dude,
I'll take all ten grams from you.

153
00:14:59,456 --> 00:15:03,833
Ten grams? All right. That's nine
apiece. Nine times ten is, uh...

154
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,419
It's, uh, 75.

155
00:15:05,586 --> 00:15:06,997
Yeah, 75. Right.

156
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,336
It's 90, Bob.

157
00:15:10,216 --> 00:15:12,255
Yeah, Bob. That's 90.

158
00:15:24,312 --> 00:15:28,060
Hey, Bob, how much do you want
for her? How much of this for her?

159
00:15:28,191 --> 00:15:29,056
Huh?

160
00:15:29,192 --> 00:15:32,358
How much of this do you want
for the foxy female?

161
00:15:32,486 --> 00:15:36,531
Hey. What do you think I am?
Some kind of closet pimp?

162
00:15:37,324 --> 00:15:41,701
I've never heard of such a violation
of woman's rights in all my life.

163
00:15:44,706 --> 00:15:49,166
Just out of curiosity, how many bags
of speed would you give me for this girl?

164
00:15:49,293 --> 00:15:50,669
I, uh... I don't know.

165
00:15:50,795 --> 00:15:53,464
You twerp! You touch me and
I'll knock your block off.

166
00:15:53,589 --> 00:15:54,787
She's mean, man.

167
00:15:54,924 --> 00:15:58,968
All right, all right.
Let's finish this deal.

168
00:15:59,136 --> 00:16:01,424
- Sorry.
- Pick up your stuff, David, and go.

169
00:16:01,555 --> 00:16:03,298
We've got some things to do.

170
00:16:03,431 --> 00:16:05,590
All right. Sorry, Dianne. Here, Bob.

171
00:16:05,725 --> 00:16:07,599
Yeah.

172
00:16:07,727 --> 00:16:10,099
- All right, man.
- All right. Thanks.

173
00:16:12,106 --> 00:16:14,775
All right. You guys have a good evening.

174
00:16:17,361 --> 00:16:21,405
Next time you step in the middle of one of
my deals to help me with my arithmetic,

175
00:16:21,531 --> 00:16:26,774
I'll sell you to the first one-eyed carnival
freak I find for a pack of chewing gum.

176
00:16:29,706 --> 00:16:31,615
Look at me, babe. I'm hysterical.

177
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:35,832
Sorry, Bob.

178
00:16:38,505 --> 00:16:44,211
Just try to remember. Was it
a round collar, a scoop neck, or what?

179
00:16:44,886 --> 00:16:47,093
It was a blouse. A blouse.

180
00:16:47,222 --> 00:16:49,095
Um...

181
00:16:49,224 --> 00:16:51,679
I really don't remember.

182
00:17:36,058 --> 00:17:39,143
Dianne, are you
goin' crazy or something?

183
00:17:42,231 --> 00:17:44,935
Dianne, what the fuck are you doin'?

184
00:17:45,776 --> 00:17:50,733
What are you on? Glue or something?
Dianne, look. We ought to be out workin'.

185
00:17:50,864 --> 00:17:55,110
<i>I know this hospital on the coast.
I know it's a virgin. I know it is.</i>

186
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:59,119
I mean, this place has got security zero.

187
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:05,369
I bet they got coke, mammy. All those
hospitals, they always hold big-time coke.

188
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:10,665
You're crazy, Bob. We just pulled off
the best score we make in months

189
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,290
and off you trot looking for more.

190
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,917
Man, you don't know
when to take a break.

191
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:18,096
Come on, Bob.

192
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:24,393
You know me. I can't stand
to go on for ever like this.

193
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:29,516
Come on. Why don't you take me in the
bedroom and just hold me for a while?

194
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:33,938
What do you want me to hold you for?
Look, Dianne, we ought to be out crackin'.

195
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,395
- I thought you loved me.
- Why don't we just...

196
00:18:36,531 --> 00:18:39,282
But you won't fuck me
and I always have to drive.

197
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:43,572
Look, why don't we just, uh, uh,
head up to that hospital right now

198
00:18:44,246 --> 00:18:47,117
and see if we can make it there
before it gets daylight?

199
00:18:47,249 --> 00:18:52,290
I mean, babe, you're just gonna
flip out when you see this one, man.

200
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,378
I mean...

201
00:18:57,675 --> 00:19:02,918
I can just see all those bottles of pills
that hospital's holding for me right now.

202
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,139
Up against the wall!

203
00:19:11,271 --> 00:19:14,391
- Up against the wall.
- Don't give me any shit. Shut up.

204
00:19:16,818 --> 00:19:19,273
Check the other room.

205
00:19:20,613 --> 00:19:22,404
All right, you two. Turn around.

206
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:28,078
I said the other day "Bob's slowed down."
Then you knock off another pharmacy.

207
00:19:28,203 --> 00:19:29,947
- Bullshit.
- Didn't you expect me?

208
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,749
- I didn't make no drugstore in years.
- Bullshit!

209
00:19:32,874 --> 00:19:36,160
Look, man, you ain't gonna find nothing.

210
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:44,335
Just let me phone my lawyer. I'm sure
he can straighten this whole thing out.

211
00:19:44,468 --> 00:19:47,884
- Do I look like I'm using?
- You piece of shit.

212
00:19:51,517 --> 00:19:55,431
That's real nice, Bob. Looks
like you're hooked to the gills.

213
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:58,304
- You got a warrant?
- Yeah, I got a warrant.

214
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,646
Pasted on the end of one of these slugs.

215
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:06,025
You give me any more shit, I'm gonna
give you a good close look at one of 'em.

216
00:20:06,155 --> 00:20:10,615
Whoa, heavy, man. You guys been readin'
too much Mickey Spillane or somethin'?

217
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:12,534
You don't seem to understand.

218
00:20:13,537 --> 00:20:16,538
Hey, come on. Not those clubs.
Those are my Ben Hogans.

219
00:20:16,998 --> 00:20:19,869
Why you gotta mess with the clubs?

220
00:20:22,795 --> 00:20:27,124
- What are you hittin' these days?
- I got my handicap down around eight.

221
00:20:27,258 --> 00:20:30,543
Eight? Bullshit. Where do you play?

222
00:20:30,678 --> 00:20:33,215
Mayfield. I hit a 75
last time I was out there.

223
00:20:33,347 --> 00:20:36,264
I don't play public courses.
Mayfield is for pussies.

224
00:20:36,391 --> 00:20:38,099
That's why you have that handicap.

225
00:20:38,226 --> 00:20:40,847
How am I supposed to play?
My clubs are all broke.

226
00:20:42,188 --> 00:20:44,264
Have a heart.

227
00:20:44,983 --> 00:20:47,652
Break two more, then leave
the fuckin' clubs alone.

228
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,359
- All right?
- Thanks, man.

229
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,693
Dianne, you haven't hid
the drugs in some stupid place

230
00:20:55,826 --> 00:20:57,865
like the Frosted Flakes again, have you?

231
00:20:57,995 --> 00:21:01,197
I don't know what the hell
you're talkin' about, fuckwad.

232
00:21:09,422 --> 00:21:14,379
- Jesus. How old is she? Is she over 18?
- 22. You're 22 years old, right?

233
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,549
- 22.
- 22.

234
00:21:17,054 --> 00:21:19,093
Lucky for you.

235
00:21:19,681 --> 00:21:23,548
OK, kiddies. Here's how it's comin' down.

236
00:21:23,685 --> 00:21:28,311
You can just tell us where the drugs are
and save yourself a whole lot of trouble,

237
00:21:30,775 --> 00:21:33,016
or you can sit there
with your mouths shut

238
00:21:33,152 --> 00:21:37,280
and we're gonna tear this place apart
board by board. Now, how's it gonna be?

239
00:22:00,677 --> 00:22:02,717
Man, I love cops.

240
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:06,637
If there were no hot-shit
cops like Gentry around

241
00:22:06,766 --> 00:22:11,095
the competition would be so heavy,
there'd be nothing left to steal.

242
00:22:11,562 --> 00:22:13,354
Right?

243
00:22:22,406 --> 00:22:24,445
All right.

244
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,859
You two take the car
and get an apartment.

245
00:22:31,664 --> 00:22:35,115
Get something on the west side.
We ain't hit nothing there in weeks.

246
00:22:35,251 --> 00:22:37,824
- It should be pretty cool by now.
- OK, Bob.

247
00:22:37,962 --> 00:22:42,089
- Don't mess it up.
- I'm not gonna mess it up. Just relax.

248
00:22:42,758 --> 00:22:47,051
Dianne and I are going over to my
mother's house to get some new threads.

249
00:22:47,178 --> 00:22:49,218
Something nice.

250
00:22:53,267 --> 00:22:54,512
- Oh!
- Hi, Ma.

251
00:22:54,644 --> 00:22:59,851
Lord, it's my dope-fiend thief of a son
and his crazy little nymphomaniac wife.

252
00:23:00,441 --> 00:23:02,480
Ma.

253
00:23:04,653 --> 00:23:05,767
Hey, Ma.

254
00:23:14,787 --> 00:23:17,195
Please tell me what I did to deserve this.

255
00:23:17,331 --> 00:23:21,459
Never knowing when there'll be a knock
on my door telling me my baby's dead.

256
00:23:21,585 --> 00:23:24,041
Green with an overdose.

257
00:23:26,632 --> 00:23:32,254
Shot by a mad pharmacist or run over
by a car while fleeing from police pursuit.

258
00:23:32,387 --> 00:23:33,418
Why me?

259
00:23:33,555 --> 00:23:37,089
You have the clothes I left here
last time I was sent to the joint?

260
00:23:37,225 --> 00:23:39,680
I threw them away.
I thought you'd never get out.

261
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:41,304
How could you think that?

262
00:23:41,437 --> 00:23:46,229
He is a thief and a dope fiend, and
that is more important to him than I am.

263
00:23:47,442 --> 00:23:48,984
If you say so, Ma.

264
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:58,112
He can go to prison. He likes it
there anyway. Don't you, Robert?

265
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,912
Why do you hate Bob and I so, Mama?

266
00:24:05,042 --> 00:24:07,793
What have we ever done
to make you hate us so?

267
00:24:09,296 --> 00:24:13,293
I don't hate you, Dianne,
and I don't hate Robert either

268
00:24:13,425 --> 00:24:16,758
and the Good Lord knows
that to be the truth.

269
00:24:16,886 --> 00:24:19,424
I truly feel pity for you both.

270
00:24:19,555 --> 00:24:21,382
You are grown-up now,

271
00:24:21,515 --> 00:24:26,426
and yet you still act as children who
wanna do nothing but run and play.

272
00:24:26,562 --> 00:24:29,728
You cannot run and play
all your life, Dianne.

273
00:24:40,783 --> 00:24:44,911
- Is there anything else of yours up there?
- Give it away. I can always get more.

274
00:24:45,037 --> 00:24:47,492
To be sure. You'll just
go steal some more.

275
00:25:05,347 --> 00:25:07,803
Shut up!

276
00:25:13,522 --> 00:25:16,191
So, this is our new home.

277
00:25:16,316 --> 00:25:18,355
Yeah, Bob.

278
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:24,192
Why do they call it "Josephine"?

279
00:25:24,323 --> 00:25:28,237
I don't know. The guy that
rented it to me is named Dale.

280
00:25:30,788 --> 00:25:33,457
Maybe "Josephine" sounds better.

281
00:25:33,749 --> 00:25:37,828
<i>The last time I dropped acid,
I decided to make a self-portrait.</i>

282
00:25:38,795 --> 00:25:40,787
<i>Groovy, isn't it?</i>

283
00:25:46,844 --> 00:25:51,506
I can just see all those bottles of pills
that hospital's holding for me right now.

284
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,175
<i>Our stereo buy of the month.</i>

285
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:57,137
Hot dog!

286
00:25:57,896 --> 00:26:02,557
Bob, speaking of dogs, do you think
that Rick and I could get a little pup?

287
00:26:02,692 --> 00:26:07,270
Just a little something to hold
and pet when you guys are gone?

288
00:26:07,405 --> 00:26:09,777
No.

289
00:26:09,907 --> 00:26:12,030
No fucking dogs.

290
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:18,580
- What have you got against dogs?
- Look, no fucking dogs, and that's final.

291
00:26:18,707 --> 00:26:22,122
Why don't you tell them what happened
to the last one we had?

292
00:26:22,252 --> 00:26:25,205
<i>If you want them to know so much,
why don't you tell them?</i>

293
00:26:25,338 --> 00:26:27,377
I don't want to discuss it.

294
00:26:28,841 --> 00:26:32,424
We had a dog once. His name was Panda.

295
00:26:34,013 --> 00:26:36,847
The cutest little pup you ever did see.

296
00:26:36,974 --> 00:26:40,805
That little guy used to
follow Bob wherever he'd go.

297
00:26:42,187 --> 00:26:47,347
Anyway, what happened was
the police were after us during a raid...

298
00:26:47,775 --> 00:26:49,684
<i>on a drugstore in the city.</i>

299
00:26:49,819 --> 00:26:53,022
He came out of the bedroom
and he stopped at the closet

300
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,652
and then he swung at me
with that iron bar.

301
00:26:55,783 --> 00:26:58,867
<i>Little Panda got out
of the car and ran away.</i>

302
00:26:59,202 --> 00:27:01,574
<i>We looked everywhere
but there wasn't time.</i>

303
00:27:02,581 --> 00:27:05,498
The heat was on us and
we had to get out of there.

304
00:27:09,921 --> 00:27:13,372
We thought the little guy
got hit by a car or something.

305
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:15,754
But no.

306
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,427
<i>The police had him.</i>

307
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:23,967
<i>Somehow they knew he was our dog.
They followed him all the way home.</i>

308
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,807
<i>He led them to us.</i>

309
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:33,646
They put us in jail...

310
00:27:34,693 --> 00:27:37,363
and they put little Panda to sleep.

311
00:27:40,907 --> 00:27:45,569
<i>For a brighter coat, whiter teeth
and a more even disposition,</i>

312
00:27:45,829 --> 00:27:47,821
<i>there should only be one choice.</i>

313
00:27:48,206 --> 00:27:50,993
<i>Rich gravy. No cereal. Gravy...</i>

314
00:27:56,755 --> 00:28:00,171
Nadine, do you have any idea
what you've done to us

315
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,376
by just mentioning dogs in our home?

316
00:28:02,511 --> 00:28:05,048
- No. What'd I just do?
- You've no idea?

317
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,849
No, I don't, Bob. What'd I do?

318
00:28:12,353 --> 00:28:15,473
You just put a 30-day hex
on us. That's what you did.

319
00:28:15,606 --> 00:28:18,975
Our luck just flew out the window
for the next 30 days.

320
00:28:20,944 --> 00:28:26,021
You got a calendar so we'll know when
this hex ends? What month is it, anyway?

321
00:28:27,117 --> 00:28:29,109
Jesus, Bob.

322
00:28:29,244 --> 00:28:33,537
You never told us anything
about not mentioning dogs.

323
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:36,582
The reason nobody
mentioned dogs, Rick,

324
00:28:36,709 --> 00:28:40,956
is because just to have mentioned
a dog would have been a hex in itself.

325
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:46,248
Are there any other sacred things
we're not supposed to mention?

326
00:28:46,384 --> 00:28:49,054
Yeah. As a matter of fact there are.

327
00:28:49,763 --> 00:28:54,638
We might as well discuss 'em now, being
as we're shut down for the next 30 days.

328
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,720
Hats.

329
00:28:57,853 --> 00:28:59,762
OK. Hats.

330
00:28:59,897 --> 00:29:05,436
If I ever see a hat on a bed in this house,
man, like, you'll never see me again.

331
00:29:05,569 --> 00:29:08,273
- I'm gone.
- That makes two of us.

332
00:29:10,407 --> 00:29:13,692
- Why a hat?
- Because that's just the way it is, sweetie.

333
00:29:15,244 --> 00:29:18,993
And there's mirrors. Never look
at the backside of a mirror.

334
00:29:19,206 --> 00:29:24,117
It'll affect your future because
you're looking at yourself backwards.

335
00:29:27,214 --> 00:29:29,669
No. You're looking at your inner self.

336
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,879
And you don't recognise it
because you've never seen it before.

337
00:29:36,014 --> 00:29:40,841
Anyway, you can freeze into motion your
future, and that can be either good or bad.

338
00:29:40,976 --> 00:29:43,646
In any case, we don't
want to take any chances.

339
00:29:43,771 --> 00:29:47,554
But the most important thing
is the goddamn hat.

340
00:29:48,734 --> 00:29:51,569
A goddamn hat on the bed
is the king of 'em all.

341
00:29:52,946 --> 00:29:57,738
Hell, that's worth at least... what?
15 years' bad luck, or even death.

342
00:29:57,867 --> 00:30:01,615
And I'd rather have death cos
I couldn't face no 15-year hex.

343
00:30:01,746 --> 00:30:04,415
Relax, hon. Just go lay down awhile.

344
00:30:06,166 --> 00:30:10,294
You been on the go for days now.
This 30-days thing ain't gonna kill us.

345
00:30:26,685 --> 00:30:29,141
Don't let it get you down, Bob.

346
00:30:30,731 --> 00:30:33,400
Sometimes bad luck can be good luck.

347
00:30:35,944 --> 00:30:42,313
I mean, think of all the times we had
a flat tyre or engine trouble or something

348
00:30:43,701 --> 00:30:47,235
and we made it to our score
late thinking it was bad luck.

349
00:30:48,288 --> 00:30:51,740
Then we'd find out for
some reason it was good luck.

350
00:30:53,168 --> 00:30:55,623
You know what I mean?

351
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:59,257
Hell, I can't figure it out.

352
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:04,549
I just know from years of experience

353
00:31:05,554 --> 00:31:10,975
the things to look for and the signs and...

354
00:31:12,853 --> 00:31:17,847
You know what it's like? It's like, who's
ever managing such things is saying

355
00:31:17,983 --> 00:31:20,652
"Go out there and get it."

356
00:31:21,152 --> 00:31:23,821
"It's there for the taking, kid."

357
00:31:24,614 --> 00:31:29,074
"Everything's free this week. I'll
let you know when your time's up."

358
00:31:34,748 --> 00:31:37,369
"You'll see the signs."

359
00:31:37,501 --> 00:31:41,118
"Hell, all you gotta do
is look for the signs."

360
00:31:52,014 --> 00:31:54,469
Shit. Sorry, baby.

361
00:31:55,642 --> 00:31:57,386
Sorry about that, baby.

362
00:32:13,283 --> 00:32:15,739
So what's going on?

363
00:32:17,954 --> 00:32:21,537
Why don't we just go in, we plant
some stuff on them, we drag 'em on in?

364
00:32:21,666 --> 00:32:24,204
It works all the time.

365
00:32:24,335 --> 00:32:28,664
I'll tell you why not. I don't wanna get
Bob Hughes on no bullshit possession beef,

366
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:31,633
and that's all we'll get him on
unless we catch him cold,

367
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:34,594
on his way home from
a score. You know that.

368
00:32:39,182 --> 00:32:40,297
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

369
00:32:45,647 --> 00:32:48,980
<i>- Who is it, Bob?
- I don't know. I thought you knew.</i>

370
00:32:52,111 --> 00:32:54,602
- Hi.
- Did I wake you up?

371
00:32:54,738 --> 00:32:56,149
- No, no, no.
- No.

372
00:32:56,281 --> 00:33:00,030
- We were awake, weren't we, Rick?
- Well, I don't know what to think.

373
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:05,664
I saw this sinister-looking
man with a ladder

374
00:33:05,999 --> 00:33:09,782
creeping around outside
my bedroom window.

375
00:33:10,002 --> 00:33:13,916
I know that I wouldn't
be able to sleep a wink

376
00:33:14,048 --> 00:33:19,006
if I thought there was some crazy sex
maniac running around loose out there.

377
00:33:19,136 --> 00:33:23,513
Now, you just relax. We'll go down
there and check it out immediately.

378
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:27,340
- Thank you very much.
- We'll check it out as soon as we can.

379
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,885
- Good night.
- Good night.

380
00:33:30,688 --> 00:33:32,182
- Good night.
- Good night.

381
00:33:32,315 --> 00:33:34,354
- Night.
- Bye-bye.

382
00:33:38,862 --> 00:33:42,563
What the hell is she doin' up
at two o'clock in the morning?

383
00:33:53,167 --> 00:33:55,207
It's Gentry.

384
00:33:56,462 --> 00:33:58,205
Yeah.

385
00:33:58,339 --> 00:34:01,008
I bet he followed us when we moved.

386
00:34:01,717 --> 00:34:04,172
Son of a bitch.

387
00:34:06,763 --> 00:34:08,091
Yeah.

388
00:34:08,932 --> 00:34:12,632
Well, I guess we'll have to
teach him a little lesson, huh?

389
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:38,494
<i>"The reason you can never get Bob
Hughes for possession of narcotics is</i>

390
00:34:38,626 --> 00:34:43,204
that he has an arrangement with the guy
that lives on the north side of him."

391
00:34:43,338 --> 00:34:45,580
"They have a line between their houses."

392
00:34:45,799 --> 00:34:48,254
"Bob signals the guy
when he wants the stuff."

393
00:34:48,385 --> 00:34:51,670
"The neighbour puts it on the string.
Bob pulls over what he needs

394
00:34:51,805 --> 00:34:56,051
<i>and leaves the rest in the other house
where you can never find it."</i>

395
00:35:09,196 --> 00:35:11,235
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye-bye.

396
00:35:15,076 --> 00:35:16,784
- Excuse me. Got a sec?
- Yeah.

397
00:35:16,911 --> 00:35:19,318
- You live here, right?
- Right.

398
00:35:19,455 --> 00:35:22,622
I live next door. I know
it's none of my business...

399
00:35:23,876 --> 00:35:28,004
What do you suppose he has in that sack?
You think it might be junk?

400
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:31,712
One thing I am positive of -
it's not his goddamn lunch.

401
00:35:32,592 --> 00:35:36,008
About two o'clock this morning,
I look out my window and there he is.

402
00:35:36,137 --> 00:35:39,221
A big, ugly son of a bitch
wearing a long, dark raincoat,

403
00:35:39,348 --> 00:35:43,595
and he's standing on top of this ladder
looking in your upstairs windows.

404
00:35:43,727 --> 00:35:46,218
He's got one hand
underneath his raincoat.

405
00:35:46,355 --> 00:35:49,521
From where I was standing,
I gotta say, it looked kinda sick.

406
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:53,517
- I'll shoot the son of a bitch in the balls!
- Now hang on a second.

407
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:58,899
Did you see the way
they talked? All the gestures?

408
00:35:59,033 --> 00:36:02,616
They got something goin' on.
They ain't just casual acquaintances.

409
00:36:02,745 --> 00:36:05,200
Yeah, I can see that.

410
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:10,912
For a second there, it looked like
that big guy was gonna jump on Hughes

411
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:13,084
and stomp his guts out.

412
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:15,205
I would've liked to have seen that.

413
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,756
OK, I know what you guys are thinkin'.

414
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,335
"What's old Bob got me into this time?"

415
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:26,381
Well, let me tell you, this is gonna be
something. You guys are gonna love this.

416
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:30,431
- Dianne, where you goin'?
- I'm just gonna go get my cigarettes.

417
00:36:30,562 --> 00:36:33,682
All right. Hurry up. You're not
gonna want to miss this one.

418
00:36:33,815 --> 00:36:37,266
- Rick, where you goin'?
- I'm just gettin' a beer, Bob.

419
00:36:37,402 --> 00:36:40,687
All right. Don't come crying
to me when you miss out.

420
00:36:40,822 --> 00:36:43,609
OK. Sh! Here they come.
There's two of 'em.

421
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:55,953
Come here. Come over here. All right.

422
00:36:56,127 --> 00:37:00,125
They're making their move.
One guy's climbing up the ladder.

423
00:37:00,256 --> 00:37:03,043
I hope he gets pissed off at them, man.

424
00:37:03,509 --> 00:37:06,759
OK. The neighbour's comin'
out of the house. Holy shit!

425
00:37:07,054 --> 00:37:09,592
He's got a shotgun!

426
00:37:09,932 --> 00:37:12,304
Well, I'll be a son of a bitch.

427
00:37:12,434 --> 00:37:13,845
Show time!

428
00:37:16,229 --> 00:37:17,771
Whoa!

429
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:21,271
Holy shit!

430
00:38:30,089 --> 00:38:33,173
Bob, I wanna talk to you
about what happened last night.

431
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:38,128
We told the investigating officer all
we knew. We have nothing further to add.

432
00:38:39,056 --> 00:38:42,555
You little punk. Halamer and
Trousinski know you set them up,

433
00:38:42,684 --> 00:38:46,432
and I can honestly say they are
anything but happy about it.

434
00:38:46,938 --> 00:38:49,429
Now, Bob, I'm gonna make
a suggestion to you.

435
00:38:49,565 --> 00:38:53,183
Why don't you take a nice long drive
somewhere far away from here?

436
00:38:53,944 --> 00:38:58,985
Wait a minute, Gentry. I won
the goddamn war, not you.

437
00:39:00,492 --> 00:39:03,161
Who are you to dictate the terms?

438
00:39:03,286 --> 00:39:07,153
<i>Why don't you find a small-town police
department where you can be sheriff</i>

439
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:11,750
and all you gotta worry about is Saturday
night drunks and kids on Halloween?

440
00:39:14,922 --> 00:39:17,377
So you think you won the war, huh?

441
00:39:17,716 --> 00:39:19,922
Pick him up.

442
00:39:24,389 --> 00:39:28,054
You're just a junkie that got
one of my officers shot.

443
00:39:28,184 --> 00:39:32,727
And as soon as he gets ahold of you,
everybody'll forget you ever existed.

444
00:39:35,399 --> 00:39:37,937
Let him go.

445
00:39:40,612 --> 00:39:42,652
You little piece of shit.

446
00:39:48,078 --> 00:39:50,747
Let me give you a hand up, Bob.

447
00:39:51,706 --> 00:39:53,497
Fuck you, Gentry.

448
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:57,538
Don't forget your clubs, pal.
Work on your handicap.

449
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:10,300
<i>Don't think Gentry was running us out
of town, because I can stand the heat.</i>

450
00:40:10,432 --> 00:40:13,302
<i>We were splittin' because
things were going all wrong.</i>

451
00:40:13,685 --> 00:40:16,934
<i>Nadine's hex was a little more
powerful than I had calculated.</i>

452
00:40:18,439 --> 00:40:22,567
<i>It was time to change the scenery, which
happened when you went crossroading.</i>

453
00:40:22,693 --> 00:40:25,777
<i>Dianne got the narcotics together
and sent them ahead by bus</i>

454
00:40:25,904 --> 00:40:28,276
<i>to depots across the
Pacific Northwest</i>

455
00:40:28,406 --> 00:40:31,941
<i>so we could rendezvous with
the drugs as we needed them.</i>

456
00:40:32,118 --> 00:40:35,368
<i>We couldn't afford to be caught
with a car full of narcotics,</i>

457
00:40:35,496 --> 00:40:39,707
<i>so we had a backup plan in the form of a
hole punched in the floorboard of our car.</i>

458
00:40:41,377 --> 00:40:46,085
<i>When the flashing red lights became a
reality, down the hole went the stash.</i>

459
00:40:46,214 --> 00:40:48,171
Is something the matter, Officer?

460
00:40:48,633 --> 00:40:50,673
<i>Then we'd go to the next rendezvous,</i>

461
00:40:50,802 --> 00:40:55,131
<i>which was hopefully within eight
hours, before the drugs wore off.</i>

462
00:40:55,264 --> 00:41:00,471
<i>No construction stiff workin' overtime
takes more stress and strain than we did,</i>

463
00:41:00,603 --> 00:41:02,761
<i>just trying to stay high.</i>

464
00:42:01,409 --> 00:42:05,406
We rented this truck not necessarily
because we need another vehicle.

465
00:42:05,538 --> 00:42:07,779
But we can move easier
in a vehicle like this.

466
00:42:07,915 --> 00:42:11,283
It's got the right licence plates
so the average Joe will just think

467
00:42:11,418 --> 00:42:15,581
we're a couple farm boys and a prostitute
in town for a little joyride.

468
00:42:15,714 --> 00:42:16,709
Hey!

469
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,128
I always wanted to be a farmer, Bob.

470
00:42:26,765 --> 00:42:29,435
Whoa. Did you guys see that?

471
00:42:30,727 --> 00:42:33,432
- What?
- The transom.

472
00:42:33,563 --> 00:42:36,434
You guys didn't see the open transom?

473
00:42:36,566 --> 00:42:39,318
- No.
- What's a transom, Bob?

474
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:45,199
It's all clear in the back.

475
00:42:46,409 --> 00:42:49,694
All right. Gimme a lift,
then meet me around back.

476
00:42:50,621 --> 00:42:53,290
Ready? One, two, three.

477
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:21,600
Nadine, take these and
put it inside the truck.

478
00:43:21,733 --> 00:43:26,774
Rick, step in here. I want you to look at
these two safes. See them over there?

479
00:43:43,211 --> 00:43:45,250
Rick. Let's go.

480
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:53,550
Shut up!

481
00:43:57,182 --> 00:44:00,717
Christ! You're finished,
hopheads. You blew it.

482
00:44:11,153 --> 00:44:14,071
Hey, babe, you playin'
cards? Who's winning?

483
00:44:14,198 --> 00:44:16,107
<i>What's the matter with her?</i>

484
00:44:16,325 --> 00:44:18,364
Nothin'.

485
00:44:18,994 --> 00:44:21,033
Cocaine.

486
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:28,833
- Holy shit.
- What is it, Bob?

487
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:31,745
Powdered Dilaudid, that's what.

488
00:44:31,881 --> 00:44:36,258
A whole, untouched one-eighth
ounce bottle of powdered D.

489
00:44:36,385 --> 00:44:38,128
Whoo!

490
00:44:38,262 --> 00:44:42,508
Should be another partially
filled one in here somewhere.

491
00:44:43,934 --> 00:44:45,973
You see it?

492
00:44:47,478 --> 00:44:51,262
Rick, do you have any idea
what this little bottle is worth?

493
00:44:51,399 --> 00:44:56,440
- No, Bob. What's it worth?
- This here little bottle...

494
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:58,610
has got 840-some-odd sixteenths.

495
00:44:58,739 --> 00:45:03,235
And at ten dollars a sixteenth,
that comes to around 8,400 dollars

496
00:45:03,452 --> 00:45:07,235
of the best goddamn
pharmaceutical dope money can buy.

497
00:45:07,414 --> 00:45:12,752
What a find. This here little bottle
ought to last the three of us a week.

498
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:16,206
I'd better take that.

499
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:18,912
Guess we must've outrun
that hex we had on us, eh, Bob?

500
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:24,593
- Sure glad we started crossroading.
- Bob? Let's shoot it.

501
00:45:24,846 --> 00:45:28,215
You gotta be careful with
this stuff. It can kill you.

502
00:45:29,392 --> 00:45:31,349
Dianne, get a glass of water.

503
00:45:36,565 --> 00:45:38,605
Do it slow.

504
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:46,698
I'll show you how we're
gonna hide this stuff.

505
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:55,078
Right up here.

506
00:46:14,017 --> 00:46:16,638
Now, we'll take this stuff

507
00:46:16,769 --> 00:46:20,054
and then we'll cross over
a couple of these units

508
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:23,609
and stash it over somebody else's room.

509
00:46:38,914 --> 00:46:39,910
Wow.

510
00:46:50,008 --> 00:46:51,632
Hey.

511
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:54,049
Hey.

512
00:46:55,722 --> 00:46:57,761
Come on. Buck up.

513
00:46:58,599 --> 00:47:01,055
So you blew it. Big deal.

514
00:47:01,644 --> 00:47:06,186
Listen, we're gonna go out for a couple of
hours, but we'll be back in a little bit.

515
00:47:08,567 --> 00:47:11,140
What'd that son of a bitch say about me?

516
00:47:11,278 --> 00:47:13,317
He didn't say anything about you.

517
00:47:13,446 --> 00:47:16,281
Yeah, but he's not gonna
take me along any more, is he?

518
00:47:16,407 --> 00:47:22,243
Then one day you'll all just drop me off
somewhere and you'll never come back.

519
00:47:25,124 --> 00:47:27,793
Nadine, what are you talkin' about?

520
00:47:28,961 --> 00:47:32,792
Come on, honey. You're with me.
I'm not gonna leave you anywhere.

521
00:47:33,882 --> 00:47:35,708
He is a goddamn...

522
00:47:35,842 --> 00:47:36,957
- Shut up!
...hog!

523
00:47:37,135 --> 00:47:39,293
- Hog! Hog!
- Hey, shut up. Come on, honey.

524
00:47:39,429 --> 00:47:43,473
- Hog!
- Don't do that. Please, Nadine.

525
00:47:44,850 --> 00:47:47,519
We got a good thing goin' here.

526
00:47:48,062 --> 00:47:50,731
Why do you want to rock the boat?

527
00:47:51,064 --> 00:47:53,733
I just can't stand their superior ways.

528
00:47:54,568 --> 00:47:59,644
And all that crap about hexes.
You don't believe that stuff, do you?

529
00:47:59,781 --> 00:48:02,188
Look, Nadine, I don't know. OK?

530
00:48:02,325 --> 00:48:07,117
I mean, all we have to do is not talk about
pets and not leave any hats on any beds.

531
00:48:07,246 --> 00:48:09,867
Now, what's hard about that?

532
00:48:09,998 --> 00:48:16,250
I'm just gonna prove to all of you that
a hat on a bed doesn't mean anything.

533
00:48:18,214 --> 00:48:20,456
Hey, Rick. Let's go. Come on.

534
00:48:20,592 --> 00:48:23,261
I really wish you hadn't done that.

535
00:48:32,436 --> 00:48:37,856
You're just goin' out with them tonight.
When you come back, I'll show all of you.

536
00:48:37,983 --> 00:48:41,766
When I come back, I don't want to see
that hat on the bed. All right, honey?

537
00:48:44,572 --> 00:48:48,819
You know, Nadine, there's just
no talking to you sometimes. Fuck.

538
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:01,666
Hey, Rick. Rick. Rick.

539
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:07,044
Don't be too aggressive, man. We're
just trying to create a diversion. OK?

540
00:49:07,176 --> 00:49:10,093
- I don't want anybody gettin' hurt.
- OK, Bob.

541
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:17,519
- OK, babe, you all set?
- Yeah.

542
00:49:57,848 --> 00:49:59,306
Prepare to die.

543
00:51:05,243 --> 00:51:06,785
Demerol. Shit.

544
00:51:26,012 --> 00:51:27,423
Argh!

545
00:51:43,654 --> 00:51:46,323
This just isn't like him.

546
00:51:46,448 --> 00:51:49,947
Bob is like a rabbit.
In and out, and no nonsense.

547
00:51:51,494 --> 00:51:54,614
That goes for a lot more
than a hospital pharmacy.

548
00:52:16,601 --> 00:52:21,595
<i>Mrs Robb to Admitting.
Mrs Jane Robb to Admitting.</i>

549
00:52:32,198 --> 00:52:34,072
Fuck!

550
00:53:18,991 --> 00:53:22,194
I don't think he's gonna come.
Why don't we go back?

551
00:53:24,538 --> 00:53:26,495
They got him.

552
00:53:26,624 --> 00:53:29,909
Bastards got him. I know it.

553
00:53:30,043 --> 00:53:32,795
I can feel it in my heart.

554
00:53:32,921 --> 00:53:34,960
Dirty bastards.

555
00:53:42,555 --> 00:53:44,594
Nadine.

556
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:08,158
Oh, my God.

557
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:13,203
Honey? I'm home.

558
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,877
You're not gonna believe the shit
that happened to me tonight.

559
00:54:23,801 --> 00:54:25,877
What's goin' on?

560
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:28,051
Who put the goddamn hat on the bed?

561
00:54:28,681 --> 00:54:30,803
She did, Bob.

562
00:54:30,933 --> 00:54:33,340
She didn't mean anything by it.

563
00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:46,610
She bit it.

564
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:55,453
Where'd she get the stuff? She couldn't
have done this on no two sixteenths.

565
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:58,250
What's she been doing? Saving it up?

566
00:55:05,006 --> 00:55:08,624
- Who gave her this?
- What is it?

567
00:55:08,759 --> 00:55:12,045
Damn! She must've picked it up
off the floor of the truck

568
00:55:12,179 --> 00:55:14,931
when we were collecting these bottles.

569
00:55:16,767 --> 00:55:18,806
Conniving little bitch.

570
00:55:19,978 --> 00:55:22,017
Bob?

571
00:55:22,605 --> 00:55:26,685
You can't say that
about her, Bob. She's dead.

572
00:55:28,277 --> 00:55:30,946
You don't say anything bad about her.

573
00:55:34,825 --> 00:55:36,864
Rick.

574
00:55:38,662 --> 00:55:40,701
She beat you.

575
00:55:41,331 --> 00:55:46,158
Your own woman beat you
out of your cut on a score.

576
00:55:49,130 --> 00:55:51,585
She got what she deserves.

577
00:55:53,759 --> 00:55:55,218
Listen, man.

578
00:55:55,344 --> 00:55:59,673
Not only that. She threw a hex on us
we'll all be lucky to outrun, huh?

579
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:06,100
She left us with an OD'd stiff, which is
paramount to a murder beef in this state.

580
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:09,514
For Christ's sake, get this
goddamn hat off the bed!

581
00:56:31,127 --> 00:56:32,621
Cold.

582
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:13,330
Hell, it's like trying
to raise a couple of kids

583
00:57:13,458 --> 00:57:17,537
when you take on a couple like that
and try and teach 'em to steal.

584
00:57:18,754 --> 00:57:20,414
Know what I mean, Dianne?

585
00:57:22,341 --> 00:57:24,380
All these kids.

586
00:57:25,427 --> 00:57:27,466
They're all TV babies.

587
00:57:28,138 --> 00:57:32,467
They've been watching people killin'
each other on the boob tube for so long,

588
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,640
it's all they know.

589
00:57:35,436 --> 00:57:38,971
Hell, they think it's legal. They
think it's the right thing to do.

590
00:57:39,106 --> 00:57:41,514
I know, hon.

591
00:57:46,363 --> 00:57:48,770
I'm gettin' real tired.

592
00:57:51,785 --> 00:57:53,444
Poor Nadine.

593
00:57:54,912 --> 00:57:57,783
She was just a goddamn kid.

594
00:58:01,544 --> 00:58:03,583
Now what?

595
00:58:06,923 --> 00:58:10,339
- Hello. Are you Mr Hughes?
- Yeah.

596
00:58:10,468 --> 00:58:14,051
- Are you planning to check out today?
- No. Why?

597
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:16,801
Well, you see, sir,
we have prior commitments

598
00:58:16,933 --> 00:58:21,013
in the form of a reservation
for your room today.

599
00:58:22,396 --> 00:58:24,685
Today?

600
00:58:24,815 --> 00:58:27,388
- You mean check out today?
- I'm afraid so.

601
00:58:27,526 --> 00:58:31,025
You see, we're having
a sheriffs' convention in town

602
00:58:31,154 --> 00:58:35,615
and all these rooms have been reserved
in advance for them 90 days ago.

603
00:58:40,246 --> 00:58:44,195
All right. Could I go down to the office
and talk to you in about ten minutes?

604
00:58:44,333 --> 00:58:46,372
Give me ten minutes.

605
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:54,591
We're gonna know
some of these guys, I'll bet.

606
00:58:54,718 --> 00:58:57,718
I don't believe it.
I don't fuckin' believe it.

607
00:58:58,388 --> 00:59:01,139
A sheriffs' convention, no less.

608
00:59:01,265 --> 00:59:04,551
Why couldn't it have been
a Tupperware convention?

609
00:59:05,227 --> 00:59:07,683
Or better yet, an undertakers'.

610
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:24,449
Excuse me.

611
00:59:31,835 --> 00:59:34,041
Hello?

612
00:59:34,171 --> 00:59:36,210
Anything?

613
00:59:36,673 --> 00:59:41,749
Sorry, Mr Hughes. You should have let us
know you intended on staying this long.

614
00:59:43,012 --> 00:59:49,097
Look, I've got a colleague in that room
and he's sick with the mumps.

615
00:59:49,810 --> 00:59:53,143
I'm afraid to move him. I mean,
what if they should spread?

616
00:59:53,271 --> 00:59:57,399
The doc said all we need is another day.
He can travel in another day. Come on.

617
00:59:58,151 --> 00:59:59,894
Come on.

618
01:00:39,648 --> 01:00:42,317
<i>Lock him up.
He did it. Lock him up!</i>

619
01:00:42,442 --> 01:00:44,897
<i>Guilty! Guilty!</i>

620
01:00:48,698 --> 01:00:53,489
It's gonna be one heck of a time
getting her out of that crawlspace.

621
01:00:56,204 --> 01:00:59,787
Don't know if I'm ever gonna
get my nails done now.

622
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:06,457
Nadine really got to you, didn't she, Bob?

623
01:01:07,465 --> 01:01:10,134
Yeah, well, I'll tell you what's wrong.

624
01:01:10,259 --> 01:01:14,257
I'm afraid some big fat cop's gonna come
rumbling through this door any minute.

625
01:01:14,388 --> 01:01:17,223
He'll say "Get outta this room.
This is my room."

626
01:01:22,562 --> 01:01:24,601
Dianne.

627
01:01:25,607 --> 01:01:27,646
Yeah?

628
01:01:28,484 --> 01:01:30,227
I love you.

629
01:01:33,072 --> 01:01:35,527
I love you, too.

630
01:01:49,212 --> 01:01:51,881
- Hey, Dianne?
- Hm?

631
01:01:55,926 --> 01:01:59,046
We have that blue garment bag?
The big one.

632
01:02:40,676 --> 01:02:42,715
Dianne?

633
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:06,398
Don't worry, Bob. We'll make it.
We always do, don't we?

634
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:31,755
Honey? Let's go, dear.
We're gonna miss our flight.

635
01:03:32,849 --> 01:03:34,888
Hi.

636
01:03:38,729 --> 01:03:40,769
Wow.

637
01:03:41,857 --> 01:03:44,313
What a busy day.

638
01:03:46,528 --> 01:03:48,402
What do you say we go up to the attic,

639
01:03:48,530 --> 01:03:52,314
divide the stuff up with Rick
and give him the big end?

640
01:03:52,450 --> 01:03:54,775
Don't count him short.

641
01:03:54,911 --> 01:03:58,114
What's going on, Bob?
What are you thinking about?

642
01:04:02,001 --> 01:04:04,040
Nothin'.

643
01:04:07,589 --> 01:04:12,417
I'm thinking about, uh...
headin' back home.

644
01:04:14,053 --> 01:04:16,342
Gettin' in the 21-day
methadone programme.

645
01:04:16,681 --> 01:04:20,014
- Cleaning up my act.
- Are you kidding?

646
01:04:21,143 --> 01:04:23,266
No, I'm not.

647
01:04:25,981 --> 01:04:27,938
Dianne,

648
01:04:28,984 --> 01:04:31,439
I can't do it any more.

649
01:04:32,737 --> 01:04:35,228
I'm not goin' on
no withdrawal programme.

650
01:04:35,365 --> 01:04:37,820
So what's gonna happen to me?

651
01:04:38,701 --> 01:04:41,157
Why don't you come with me?

652
01:04:41,746 --> 01:04:46,288
No, thanks, buster. Not a fucking word
do you mention about all this.

653
01:04:46,875 --> 01:04:51,204
Right out of the clear blue sky you say
you're gonna clean up your hand.

654
01:04:51,338 --> 01:04:53,579
And you know I can't.

655
01:04:56,843 --> 01:04:59,168
Look, Dianne, do what you want.

656
01:04:59,303 --> 01:05:02,755
Take whatever we got. I only
need enough to get me home.

657
01:05:23,367 --> 01:05:26,238
Get the shovel. I'll take care of her.

658
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:41,796
Go back to the truck.

659
01:05:52,144 --> 01:05:54,183
Go.

660
01:11:10,604 --> 01:11:14,601
<i>Have you ever been on
a withdrawal programme before?</i>

661
01:11:14,733 --> 01:11:16,061
<i>No.</i>

662
01:11:16,192 --> 01:11:20,735
<i>I see. How long have
you been on drugs altogether?</i>

663
01:11:23,908 --> 01:11:25,367
<i>All my life.</i>

664
01:11:26,452 --> 01:11:29,322
<i>Then this isn't
your first time withdrawing?</i>

665
01:11:29,455 --> 01:11:34,163
<i>No. This is my first time
withdrawing on methadone.</i>

666
01:11:35,502 --> 01:11:37,708
<i>How old are you now?</i>

667
01:11:37,837 --> 01:11:39,877
<i>26.</i>

668
01:11:40,340 --> 01:11:43,673
<i>- Are you married?
- Uh, yeah.</i>

669
01:11:45,011 --> 01:11:46,553
Where is your wife?

670
01:11:46,679 --> 01:11:48,755
I don't know.

671
01:11:48,889 --> 01:11:50,264
Do you have children?

672
01:11:50,391 --> 01:11:52,430
No.

673
01:11:52,893 --> 01:11:54,850
Um...

674
01:11:54,978 --> 01:11:57,101
Do you have a job?

675
01:11:57,230 --> 01:11:59,270
No.

676
01:11:59,733 --> 01:12:02,686
Do you have a Social Security number?

677
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:05,776
No.

678
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:10,026
Have you ever been
convicted of a felony?

679
01:12:12,369 --> 01:12:16,153
- Yeah, a few times.
- What were they?

680
01:12:16,748 --> 01:12:19,417
What felonies were you convicted of?

681
01:12:20,251 --> 01:12:22,493
What do you want? My life story?

682
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,374
Look, lady.

683
01:12:25,673 --> 01:12:31,960
I'm a junkie. I like drugs. I like the whole lifestyle.
But it just didn't pay off.

684
01:12:35,307 --> 01:12:38,059
You know, you don't see
my kind of people.

685
01:12:38,977 --> 01:12:42,512
Cos my kind of people, they don't
come down here and beg dope.

686
01:12:42,647 --> 01:12:46,347
They go out and get it, and
if they miss, they go to jail

687
01:12:46,484 --> 01:12:50,778
and they kick alone with nothing
in some holding tank.

688
01:12:52,114 --> 01:12:53,941
I'm sorry, Bob.

689
01:12:54,074 --> 01:12:56,281
I don't mean to hassle you.

690
01:12:56,410 --> 01:13:01,285
All this is required. I'm sorry
if you think it's unnecessary.

691
01:13:02,916 --> 01:13:06,000
Have you ever considered
becoming a counsellor

692
01:13:06,127 --> 01:13:09,294
and helping other addicts
with their problems?

693
01:13:09,422 --> 01:13:10,999
No.

694
01:13:11,132 --> 01:13:13,254
Why not?

695
01:13:13,384 --> 01:13:16,420
Well, to begin with,

696
01:13:16,553 --> 01:13:22,591
nobody - and I mean nobody -
can talk a junkie out of using.

697
01:13:23,268 --> 01:13:28,095
You can talk to them for years, but sooner
or later they'll get ahold of something.

698
01:13:28,231 --> 01:13:31,813
Maybe it's not dope. Maybe it's booze.

699
01:13:31,943 --> 01:13:34,612
Maybe it's glue. Maybe it's gasoline.

700
01:13:35,613 --> 01:13:37,938
Maybe it's a gunshot in the head.

701
01:13:39,241 --> 01:13:41,068
But something.

702
01:13:41,201 --> 01:13:44,285
Something to relieve the pressures
of their everyday life,

703
01:13:44,412 --> 01:13:47,082
like... having to tie their shoes.

704
01:14:03,263 --> 01:14:05,718
Tom, you got some mail here.

705
01:14:08,268 --> 01:14:11,304
- Bless you.
- You're welcome.

706
01:14:26,660 --> 01:14:28,699
Father Murphy.

707
01:14:29,662 --> 01:14:31,702
Hey, Tom.

708
01:14:34,625 --> 01:14:36,867
Well, well.

709
01:14:37,545 --> 01:14:39,584
Bad Bobby Hughes.

710
01:14:40,714 --> 01:14:45,791
Imagine seeing you here
after all these years.

711
01:14:47,179 --> 01:14:48,922
You live here too?

712
01:14:49,055 --> 01:14:51,724
I have nowhere else to go.

713
01:14:52,976 --> 01:14:58,314
There is no demand in the priesthood
for elderly drug addicts.

714
01:14:58,439 --> 01:15:04,144
An indiscretion in 1970-
you were inside, I believe...

715
01:15:04,486 --> 01:15:08,234
resulted in my descent to this sorry state.

716
01:15:11,618 --> 01:15:15,911
As a matter of fact,
I'm feeling a bit sick right now.

717
01:15:16,956 --> 01:15:19,411
Are you holding?

718
01:15:20,084 --> 01:15:21,708
Nope.

719
01:15:21,835 --> 01:15:25,750
They got me on this
21-day thing. Methadone.

720
01:15:28,091 --> 01:15:30,131
What about yourself?

721
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:32,592
Oh, sure.

722
01:15:32,846 --> 01:15:35,087
I'm on the programme.

723
01:15:35,223 --> 01:15:40,561
But sometimes I get a little bit ahead
of my schedule. You understand?

724
01:15:42,605 --> 01:15:50,398
And sometimes I think some junkie nurse
may be stepping on my medication.

725
01:15:51,863 --> 01:15:54,319
But I can't be sure.

726
01:15:56,075 --> 01:15:58,613
How about it? You wanna score?

727
01:15:58,744 --> 01:16:00,571
Nah.

728
01:16:01,872 --> 01:16:04,494
But I'll keep you company.

729
01:16:06,543 --> 01:16:09,081
This here is an art work.

730
01:16:09,212 --> 01:16:11,668
A work of art. So is that.

731
01:16:13,425 --> 01:16:15,464
More art work.

732
01:16:15,927 --> 01:16:18,596
Look at the bole on that tree there.

733
01:16:20,806 --> 01:16:24,970
That reminds me. I used
to know an old croaker.

734
01:16:25,102 --> 01:16:29,100
I think it was on that street.
Maybe it was the next street over.

735
01:16:29,231 --> 01:16:32,647
Ah... he'd write like a major.

736
01:16:33,485 --> 01:16:36,936
<i>Tom knew his way
around the old neighbourhoods.</i>

737
01:16:37,822 --> 01:16:39,779
<i>I'd known Tom since I
was an altar boy.</i>

738
01:16:39,907 --> 01:16:44,450
<i>Benevolent Father Murphy, the most
notorious dope fiend on the Coast.</i>

739
01:16:44,704 --> 01:16:49,614
<i>When he was holding he'd always share with
those who weren't. He was very kind.</i>

740
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:54,625
<i>Tom was king then. He had it all.
His ass was covered in this life and the next.</i>

741
01:16:55,297 --> 01:16:58,167
<i>I bet he shot a million
bucks in his arm.</i>

742
01:17:00,927 --> 01:17:04,046
OK. This is what you call
a radial-arm drill press.

743
01:17:04,972 --> 01:17:08,507
Get the drill you want,
putting it in the holder.

744
01:17:08,642 --> 01:17:10,967
Make sure you've got a good grip on it.

745
01:17:11,186 --> 01:17:15,231
That brings your drill down to
your work. Position it over the hole.

746
01:17:15,357 --> 01:17:18,311
That's your clutch.
This is your power feed.

747
01:17:18,443 --> 01:17:21,194
This is the clutch that
engages the power feed.

748
01:17:21,321 --> 01:17:23,990
Put that in and just let it drill.

749
01:17:50,514 --> 01:17:52,637
<i>You go to work loaded, it'll show.</i>

750
01:17:52,808 --> 01:17:55,133
Being loaded's like being drunk.

751
01:17:55,269 --> 01:17:58,803
You drink or get high in the morning,
your boss is gonna see it.

752
01:17:58,939 --> 01:18:01,429
You'll get fired, then
you're not making money.

753
01:18:01,566 --> 01:18:03,973
Then you're gonna have
to do something else.

754
01:18:04,110 --> 01:18:07,111
You're gonna have to rob,
steal, sell. You know?

755
01:18:07,238 --> 01:18:08,946
Um...

756
01:18:09,073 --> 01:18:13,865
Somewhere in that robbing you might
end up killing your best buddy over a fix.

757
01:18:13,994 --> 01:18:17,114
You'll go down the tubes.
There's no other way around it.

758
01:18:17,247 --> 01:18:20,450
The more you use, the longer
you use, the further down you go.

759
01:18:21,418 --> 01:18:23,955
Then you're gonna find
you're on the bottom.

760
01:18:45,273 --> 01:18:47,846
Catching up on your reading?

761
01:18:51,737 --> 01:18:55,438
You didn't stay gone long,
Bob. What happened?

762
01:18:55,574 --> 01:18:57,613
Nothing happened.

763
01:18:58,076 --> 01:19:00,365
I hear you're on a methadone programme.

764
01:19:00,495 --> 01:19:05,038
You don't think that'll keep Trousinski
from jumping your ass, do you?

765
01:19:05,542 --> 01:19:08,377
To tell you the truth,
I haven't given it much thought.

766
01:19:09,837 --> 01:19:12,957
You know, for once
I'm not here to hassle you.

767
01:19:13,090 --> 01:19:17,668
Trousinski lost his gold badge over
that little incident. He's working traffic.

768
01:19:17,803 --> 01:19:21,337
He's made so many goddamn threats,
he's almost gonna have to hurt you.

769
01:19:21,473 --> 01:19:24,142
And I don't wanna see that happen.

770
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:27,977
Man, look. What can I say?
I got a job, you know?

771
01:19:30,481 --> 01:19:34,313
What happened out there in the sticks,
Bob? Where's Dianne?

772
01:19:36,612 --> 01:19:39,281
You know how whimsical women are.

773
01:19:40,324 --> 01:19:45,199
She found some other dude to chase after
and off she went, chasin' after him.

774
01:19:46,913 --> 01:19:49,321
I find that a little hard to believe.

775
01:19:49,624 --> 01:19:54,582
You and Dianne have been running
around together since you were little kids.

776
01:20:00,926 --> 01:20:03,595
I hope you make out on that job of yours.

777
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:07,338
And I sincerely hope that
you straighten up a little bit.

778
01:20:08,099 --> 01:20:09,759
Take care of yourself, Bob.

779
01:20:50,722 --> 01:20:53,295
My old lady's still
out there right now.

780
01:20:53,975 --> 01:20:56,726
Yeah. I can't do nothing with her. I tried.

781
01:20:56,853 --> 01:21:01,680
I told her to come. She won't come
cos she's doing her own thing.

782
01:21:01,815 --> 01:21:04,650
What I was doin', I was
goin' right to the source.

783
01:21:05,319 --> 01:21:09,482
Right to the source. Where do they
make drugs? In the drugstores.

784
01:21:12,283 --> 01:21:15,035
If you want some money
you go to the bank, huh?

785
01:21:17,455 --> 01:21:22,662
"Yeah, honey, I gotta stop by the bank and
the drugstore. I'll be home after a while."

786
01:21:23,836 --> 01:21:27,750
What are you crying for? You want
to do the drugs, you gotta pay for 'em.

787
01:21:27,881 --> 01:21:30,337
Where's my fuckin' money, you bitch?

788
01:21:32,677 --> 01:21:35,168
Punk. Where the fuck's my money?

789
01:21:35,305 --> 01:21:37,795
Come on. This is the third
time I had to ask you.

790
01:21:37,932 --> 01:21:41,716
What are you gonna say? Say something.
You want me to beat you more?

791
01:21:41,852 --> 01:21:45,435
Hey, David. What do you
think you're doin', man?

792
01:21:45,564 --> 01:21:47,722
Huh? What do you think you're doin'?

793
01:21:47,858 --> 01:21:50,349
This kid's cryin', man.

794
01:21:50,485 --> 01:21:52,691
So? It's business. What do you care?

795
01:21:52,821 --> 01:21:56,486
Why don't you go away and mind
your own business? What do you care?

796
01:21:56,616 --> 01:21:58,158
Cos it bugs me.

797
01:21:58,284 --> 01:22:00,775
- Take a walk.
- Hey, man. Come on.

798
01:22:00,912 --> 01:22:02,904
Goddamn!

799
01:22:03,039 --> 01:22:06,822
<i>- David, why don't you grow up, man?
- I am grown-up.</i>

800
01:22:06,959 --> 01:22:08,785
Asshole!

801
01:22:09,628 --> 01:22:11,834
Why didn't you do something, man?

802
01:22:11,963 --> 01:22:16,791
What's up with you, man? I thought you...
Man, I'm not buying you no lunch.

803
01:22:20,054 --> 01:22:23,423
You know, Tom, you told me
a lot of the old-time stories

804
01:22:23,557 --> 01:22:30,769
about how you used to stick your arm
in between the bars of the cell

805
01:22:31,106 --> 01:22:34,391
and a guard would come by and
he'd fire you up a shot of morphine.

806
01:22:34,526 --> 01:22:36,565
They never did that for me.

807
01:22:37,404 --> 01:22:40,073
They don't do that for anyone any more.

808
01:22:42,158 --> 01:22:50,450
Narcotics have been systematically
scapegoated and demonised.

809
01:22:52,542 --> 01:22:57,785
The idea that anyone can use drugs
and escape a horrible fate

810
01:22:57,922 --> 01:23:00,247
is anathema to these idiots.

811
01:23:01,509 --> 01:23:04,960
I predict in the near future

812
01:23:05,096 --> 01:23:09,757
right-wingers will use drug hysteria

813
01:23:10,476 --> 01:23:12,515
as a pretext

814
01:23:13,228 --> 01:23:18,269
to set up an international
police apparatus.

815
01:23:21,027 --> 01:23:28,025
I'm an old man and I may not live to see
a final solution of the drug problem.

816
01:23:30,869 --> 01:23:35,330
You know what, Tom? You might
have missed your calling.

817
01:23:35,624 --> 01:23:37,912
You should have been a philosopher.

818
01:23:38,043 --> 01:23:41,957
Well, Bob, in another life,
perhaps. In another life.

819
01:24:07,695 --> 01:24:09,734
Who is it?

820
01:24:10,531 --> 01:24:12,570
Who is it?

821
01:24:23,752 --> 01:24:25,329
Hey.

822
01:24:28,506 --> 01:24:31,590
Jesus. What kind of a dump is this?

823
01:24:33,093 --> 01:24:36,178
And where is the female?
You might as well trot her out.

824
01:24:36,305 --> 01:24:38,428
You don't ever change, do you, Dianne?

825
01:24:38,557 --> 01:24:41,226
Goddamn right I don't. Why should I?

826
01:24:42,352 --> 01:24:44,641
I was just commenting
on how good you look.

827
01:24:44,771 --> 01:24:48,815
- Yeah? I'll bet.
- Hey, how about a cup of tea?

828
01:24:48,941 --> 01:24:50,850
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

829
01:24:52,028 --> 01:24:55,112
So, how's that methadone
thing workin' out?

830
01:24:56,615 --> 01:24:58,109
So-so.

831
01:24:58,242 --> 01:25:03,698
- I got a job. Did I tell you that?
- No shit! Where are you working?

832
01:25:03,830 --> 01:25:04,779
Oh,

833
01:25:04,914 --> 01:25:06,954
just a machine shop over on Western.

834
01:25:07,083 --> 01:25:09,870
Yeah? What do you do there?

835
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:13,589
I, uh... I drill holes.

836
01:25:14,173 --> 01:25:16,000
- Drill holes?
- Yeah.

837
01:25:16,133 --> 01:25:20,878
I drill... I drill these holes
that, uh, bolts fit into.

838
01:25:21,763 --> 01:25:24,337
Yeah? How do you like it?

839
01:25:24,474 --> 01:25:28,472
I'll tell you the truth. It's kind of
a drag, but it pays the rent.

840
01:25:32,982 --> 01:25:36,185
Then you're really serious.
You're gonna go on with this thing.

841
01:25:37,194 --> 01:25:38,569
Yeah.

842
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:44,193
Dianne, why don't you take
your coat off and stay awhile?

843
01:25:44,326 --> 01:25:47,944
I can't. I got people
waiting for me out in the car.

844
01:25:48,079 --> 01:25:50,285
I just came to see how you was doing.

845
01:25:53,376 --> 01:25:54,704
Here.

846
01:25:55,503 --> 01:25:57,791
That's from Rick and the rest of us.

847
01:25:58,047 --> 01:26:01,498
We kind of thought you might
need a taste once in a while.

848
01:26:06,847 --> 01:26:09,598
What happened? What made you
turn around that day?

849
01:26:09,724 --> 01:26:12,641
Was it me? Did I do something wrong?

850
01:26:12,894 --> 01:26:15,349
No, babe. It wasn't you.

851
01:26:16,272 --> 01:26:20,186
It was Nadine's death and the hex
she threw on us with that hat.

852
01:26:20,818 --> 01:26:25,526
Then I panicked when I looked out to the
parking lot and I saw all those cop cars.

853
01:26:25,656 --> 01:26:30,613
I knew I was dead. So I started coppin'
deuces. I prayed like I'd never prayed.

854
01:26:30,744 --> 01:26:36,034
I said "God, Son, Devil, whoever you are
up there, please have pity on me."

855
01:26:36,165 --> 01:26:40,578
"Please let me get this poor girl's body
out of this hotel room and into the ground

856
01:26:40,711 --> 01:26:42,917
so I don't have to spend
my life in prison."

857
01:26:43,047 --> 01:26:48,337
"And, God, if you'll do that for me, I'll
show you my appreciation by goin' home,

858
01:26:49,427 --> 01:26:53,507
gettin' on the methadone programme,
gettin' a job and livin' a virtuous life."

859
01:26:56,684 --> 01:26:58,760
We got out,

860
01:26:58,894 --> 01:27:01,979
and I promised, so here I am.

861
01:27:03,315 --> 01:27:05,391
Are you gonna stick with it for ever?

862
01:27:08,570 --> 01:27:10,609
Well...

863
01:27:11,489 --> 01:27:16,732
You know, Dianne, for all the boredom the
straight life brings, it's not that bad.

864
01:27:16,869 --> 01:27:19,787
I mean, even this crummy
little room ain't so bad.

865
01:27:19,914 --> 01:27:22,156
I mean, I actually wake up some mornings

866
01:27:22,291 --> 01:27:25,874
and I feel like something good's
gonna happen today. You know?

867
01:27:27,337 --> 01:27:31,169
I'm a regular guy. I got my regular job.
I got my regular room.

868
01:27:34,177 --> 01:27:36,632
And now I got you.

869
01:27:39,390 --> 01:27:41,015
You're crazy, Bob.

870
01:27:41,892 --> 01:27:43,600
You're really crazy.

871
01:27:49,483 --> 01:27:51,855
Dianne, why don't you go downstairs

872
01:27:51,985 --> 01:27:56,196
and tell your friends that you're
gonna spend the night, come back,

873
01:27:56,322 --> 01:27:58,647
and bed down with me for a little while?

874
01:27:58,950 --> 01:28:01,156
I'd like to, Bob.

875
01:28:01,285 --> 01:28:03,574
But I got another old man now.

876
01:28:04,872 --> 01:28:08,952
I'm... I'm Rick's old lady now.
Ain't that a gas? I work for Rick.

877
01:28:09,668 --> 01:28:14,495
There we were, teaching that brat
to steal, and now I'm on his crew.

878
01:28:15,382 --> 01:28:18,299
Things sure can get
screwed around, can't they?

879
01:28:19,510 --> 01:28:20,708
Yeah.

880
01:28:20,845 --> 01:28:22,968
And, Bob, you know me.

881
01:28:23,097 --> 01:28:26,680
I might have been a lot of things,
but I never was a tramp.

882
01:28:52,916 --> 01:28:55,454
Bob, I gotta go.

883
01:29:17,272 --> 01:29:19,311
Hey, Dianne?

884
01:29:21,568 --> 01:29:23,726
It's really good to see you.

885
01:29:23,861 --> 01:29:25,901
I mean, you look really good.

886
01:29:28,824 --> 01:29:31,695
I wish I could win you back.

887
01:31:20,344 --> 01:31:23,214
- Who is it?
- Tom, it's Bob. Open the door.

888
01:31:26,433 --> 01:31:28,924
- Hey, what's this?
- It's a gift.

889
01:31:29,060 --> 01:31:32,227
I won't be needing it. I got
my new programme down so...

890
01:31:32,355 --> 01:31:34,762
- A gift. Wow.
- Knock yourself out.

891
01:31:34,899 --> 01:31:37,437
- Mmmm...
- I don't know what's in there.

892
01:31:37,568 --> 01:31:40,652
Let's just see what's in there.

893
01:31:46,535 --> 01:31:49,204
God bless you, my son.
May you go to heaven.

894
01:31:50,955 --> 01:31:52,236
Now...

895
01:31:52,373 --> 01:31:54,449
Oh, yeah. This...

896
01:31:55,167 --> 01:31:58,667
This is for squares. Never touch the stuff.

897
01:31:59,838 --> 01:32:01,878
But this...

898
01:32:05,218 --> 01:32:08,172
A hundred sixteenths of Dilaudid.

899
01:32:11,307 --> 01:32:15,008
This should earn you an indulgence.

900
01:32:34,037 --> 01:32:35,863
Where's it at, Bob?

901
01:32:37,665 --> 01:32:40,203
- What do you want?
- We want your dope.

902
01:32:40,334 --> 01:32:43,454
You think if I had dope
I'd be sittin' in this flea trap?

903
01:32:43,587 --> 01:32:47,287
I'm on a methadone programme. You
come around for dope? That's a laugh.

904
01:32:47,424 --> 01:32:50,378
Shut up. I ain't fucking, man.

905
01:32:50,510 --> 01:32:54,804
You want it the hard way and we're just
the guys who are gonna give it to you.

906
01:32:54,931 --> 01:32:57,173
Is that you, David?

907
01:32:58,601 --> 01:33:01,637
You listen to me, you little punk.
I'm goin' straight, man.

908
01:33:01,771 --> 01:33:04,807
I ain't fuckin' bullshitting you.
I'm goin' straight.

909
01:33:04,940 --> 01:33:07,561
You oughta try it sometime.
It's good for the soul.

910
01:33:07,693 --> 01:33:09,685
Fuckin' liar!

911
01:33:09,820 --> 01:33:13,271
Where is it, Bob? We know
this is all a scam you're playing.

912
01:33:13,406 --> 01:33:16,075
Where is it? Where the fuck is it?

913
01:33:29,171 --> 01:33:33,120
<i>Nothing is more life-affirming than
getting the shit kicked out of you.</i>

914
01:33:33,258 --> 01:33:36,128
<i>I knew it in my heart.
You can buck the system,</i>

915
01:33:36,261 --> 01:33:40,590
<i>but you can't buck the dark forces
that lie hidden beneath the surface.</i>

916
01:33:40,723 --> 01:33:43,392
<i>The ones some people
call superstitions.</i>

917
01:33:44,852 --> 01:33:46,595
<i>Howling banshees.</i>

918
01:33:46,729 --> 01:33:48,223
<i>Black cats.</i>

919
01:33:48,355 --> 01:33:50,182
<i>Hats on beds.</i>

920
01:33:50,315 --> 01:33:52,438
<i>Dogs and the evil eye.</i>

921
01:33:52,567 --> 01:33:56,612
<i>So I relaxed and gave in to the notion
that, for the very first time in my life,</i>

922
01:33:56,738 --> 01:33:59,063
<i>I knew exactly what was
going to happen next.</i>

923
01:33:59,198 --> 01:34:03,030
Fuck. Now I'm gonna
kill the son of a bitch.

924
01:34:03,536 --> 01:34:09,159
I bet ya the next bastard we capture
will tell us where it's at. So he's tough.

925
01:34:10,459 --> 01:34:12,914
<i>They ain't all tough.</i>

926
01:34:16,172 --> 01:34:17,583
I say kill him.

927
01:34:19,717 --> 01:34:21,377
Did you hear me, Bob?

928
01:34:29,935 --> 01:34:32,391
Come on. Let's go.

929
01:35:16,311 --> 01:35:19,228
Is he gonna make it?
Let me get him for a second.

930
01:35:20,690 --> 01:35:23,359
Bob. Can you hear me?

931
01:35:25,194 --> 01:35:27,234
Bob, who did this to you?

932
01:35:27,697 --> 01:35:29,736
Was it Trousinski?

933
01:35:31,408 --> 01:35:33,448
Bob, tell me. Who shot you?

934
01:35:35,662 --> 01:35:37,571
The hat.

935
01:35:37,706 --> 01:35:40,375
The hat? Bob, did you say "The Hat"?

936
01:35:40,959 --> 01:35:42,998
Tell Dianne...

937
01:35:43,503 --> 01:35:46,373
to look out for the hat. Tell her.

938
01:35:46,506 --> 01:35:48,463
- OK, Bob.
- OK?

939
01:35:48,591 --> 01:35:51,082
- So The Hat shot you. Right, Bob?
- No.

940
01:35:53,887 --> 01:35:56,295
The TV baby shot me.

941
01:35:57,224 --> 01:35:59,631
The TV Baby shot you
but The Hat was with him.

942
01:35:59,768 --> 01:36:02,804
Who's The Hat? You gotta
tell me so I can tell Dianne.

943
01:36:08,526 --> 01:36:10,684
Never mind.

944
01:36:11,362 --> 01:36:13,817
I'll tell her myself.

945
01:36:18,535 --> 01:36:21,204
We gotta get him outta here.

946
01:36:53,442 --> 01:36:55,814
<i>It's this fucking life.</i>

947
01:36:56,362 --> 01:36:59,446
<i>You never know what's
gonna happen next.</i>

948
01:37:01,617 --> 01:37:05,151
<i>That's why Nadine spiked
herself with the easy way out.</i>

949
01:37:06,246 --> 01:37:09,247
<i>That's why Dianne
keeps on goin' like she does.</i>

950
01:37:12,001 --> 01:37:16,995
<i>See, most people don't know how they're
gonna feel from one minute to the next.</i>

951
01:37:18,090 --> 01:37:20,842
<i>But a dope fiend has
a pretty good idea.</i>

952
01:37:21,885 --> 01:37:25,883
<i>All you gotta do is look at
the labels on the little bottles.</i>

953
01:37:29,809 --> 01:37:32,478
<i>You gotta know how
to read the signs.</i>

954
01:37:33,229 --> 01:37:37,273
<i>That's what the hat on the bed was,
which is why I'm not scared.</i>

955
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:39,606
<i>I paid my debt to the hat.</i>

956
01:37:42,237 --> 01:37:44,526
<i>The irony was fucking brilliant.</i>

957
01:37:44,656 --> 01:37:49,650
<i>The chickenshit cops were giving me an
escort to the fattest pharmacy in town.</i>

958
01:37:53,081 --> 01:37:55,536
<i>I was still alive.</i>

959
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,669
<i>Hope they can keep me alive.</i>
