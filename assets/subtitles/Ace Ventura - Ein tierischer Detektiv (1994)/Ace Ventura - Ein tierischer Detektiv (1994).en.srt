1
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,840
Heads up! Good defense!

2
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,466
Good defense!

3
00:02:02,771 --> 00:02:05,149
We're going downtown.

4
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:17,537
Shut the hell up, you stupid mutt!

5
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:19,330
What do you want?

6
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:24,461
HDS, sir. How are you this afternoon?
Alrighty. l have a package for you.

7
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,047
lt sounds broken.

8
00:02:29,298 --> 00:02:33,761
Most likely. l'll bet it was something
nice. This is an insurance form.

9
00:02:34,011 --> 00:02:36,763
lf you'll just sign here,
here, and here...

10
00:02:37,014 --> 00:02:39,725
... we'll get the rest of the forms
to you soon.

11
00:02:43,771 --> 00:02:45,523
That's a lovely dog.

12
00:02:45,773 --> 00:02:49,401
-Do you mind if l pet him?
-l don't give a rat's ass.

13
00:03:01,163 --> 00:03:02,999
Oh, brother!

14
00:03:03,207 --> 00:03:05,250
That's fine. l can finish the rest.

15
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,087
You just have yourself a good day.
Take care now. Bye-bye.

16
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:23,560
Excuse me! HDS!

17
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,646
HDS! Coming through!

18
00:03:25,896 --> 00:03:27,314
Got a package, people!

19
00:03:41,871 --> 00:03:43,288
Get away from the door.

20
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:49,794
What's the matter with you?
l said, get!

21
00:03:54,884 --> 00:03:55,967
Son of a bitch!

22
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,178
That was a close one!

23
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,514
Unfortunately...

24
00:04:00,764 --> 00:04:04,100
... in every contest
there must be a loser.

25
00:04:15,738 --> 00:04:16,905
Hungry, fellow?

26
00:04:21,326 --> 00:04:22,910
There you go.

27
00:04:27,373 --> 00:04:30,710
No problem. lt gets flooded.
We'll just wait a few seconds.

28
00:04:32,295 --> 00:04:33,964
Or we can try it now.

29
00:04:34,298 --> 00:04:35,298
Putz!

30
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:36,592
Come on!

31
00:04:37,174 --> 00:04:39,094
Get out! Get out!

32
00:04:41,847 --> 00:04:44,891
Warning: Assholes
are closer than they appear!

33
00:04:49,354 --> 00:04:51,772
Give me a push while you're back there.

34
00:04:53,816 --> 00:04:55,902
Alrighty, then!

35
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:00,532
lt's alive!

36
00:05:00,782 --> 00:05:02,492
lt's alive!

37
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:50,872
My little baby, come here.
You missed Mommy, didn't you?

38
00:05:51,123 --> 00:05:55,545
Yes, you did. Did Daddy hurt you?
l won't let him. No, l won't.

39
00:05:56,169 --> 00:06:00,882
He can keep the big TV, but he's not
gonna hurt my baby, no he's not.

40
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,596
Thank you, Mr. Ventura.

41
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,394
How can l ever repay you?

42
00:06:11,643 --> 00:06:12,978
A reward would be good.

43
00:06:13,228 --> 00:06:17,274
There is some damage to my car,
and l had to fill it with premium.

44
00:06:20,735 --> 00:06:23,822
Would you like for me
to take your pants off instead?

45
00:06:25,198 --> 00:06:27,868
Gee! Let me think.

46
00:06:28,202 --> 00:06:29,453
Sure.

47
00:06:38,045 --> 00:06:40,839
People are real friendly around here.

48
00:08:37,205 --> 00:08:38,915
Ventura!

49
00:08:41,084 --> 00:08:42,627
Yes, Satan?

50
00:08:43,711 --> 00:08:46,673
l'm sorry, sir.
You sounded like someone else.

51
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:49,467
Never mind the wisecracks, Ventura.

52
00:08:52,011 --> 00:08:53,470
You owe me rent.

53
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:56,807
Mr. Shickadance, l told you,
you're my first priority.

54
00:08:57,058 --> 00:09:00,603
l'm on a very big case right now.
Check this out.

55
00:09:00,812 --> 00:09:03,647
Look at that.
That's a true albino pigeon.

56
00:09:03,897 --> 00:09:07,235
Some rich guy lost it.
He's offering a $25,000 reward.

57
00:09:07,484 --> 00:09:09,444
As soon as l find this bird...

58
00:09:09,695 --> 00:09:10,613
... you're paid.

59
00:09:10,947 --> 00:09:13,323
l heard animals in there.

60
00:09:13,573 --> 00:09:16,369
l heard them again this morning,
scratching around.

61
00:09:16,577 --> 00:09:18,621
l never bring my work home with me.

62
00:09:18,912 --> 00:09:20,163
Oh, yeah?

63
00:09:20,455 --> 00:09:23,209
What's all this pet food for?

64
00:09:24,168 --> 00:09:25,085
Fiber.

65
00:09:26,963 --> 00:09:29,048
Wanna take a look inside? Come on!

66
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:31,007
Come on!

67
00:09:43,395 --> 00:09:45,398
Go ahead. Snoop around!

68
00:09:58,618 --> 00:09:59,661
Well?

69
00:09:59,911 --> 00:10:01,621
Are you satisfied?

70
00:10:04,165 --> 00:10:08,462
Just don't let me catch you
with an animal in here. That's all.

71
00:10:08,712 --> 00:10:09,963
All right.

72
00:10:10,213 --> 00:10:12,507
Take care, now. Bye-bye, then.

73
00:10:14,468 --> 00:10:15,760
Loser!

74
00:10:43,038 --> 00:10:44,705
Come to me, jungle friends.

75
00:10:59,805 --> 00:11:02,765
Roger, let me ask you one question.

76
00:11:03,015 --> 00:11:05,684
How in hell do you lose
a 500-pound fish?

77
00:11:07,436 --> 00:11:08,270
What?

78
00:11:08,479 --> 00:11:10,731
l'm sorry, l was just going to say...

79
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,776
... that it's not a fish. lt's a mammal.

80
00:11:13,985 --> 00:11:16,153
Thank you, Miss Jacques Cousteau.

81
00:11:16,571 --> 00:11:18,280
She didn't mean anything by that.

82
00:11:18,531 --> 00:11:21,826
l don't give a good goddamn
about that fish!

83
00:11:22,035 --> 00:11:24,454
Fillet it and fast-food it
if you want to!

84
00:11:24,663 --> 00:11:28,041
All l give a damn about is
winning the Super Bowl!

85
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,919
My athletes have got to have
their heads in the right place!

86
00:11:32,127 --> 00:11:36,340
Shit, Roger! You've been
in this business a long time.

87
00:11:36,715 --> 00:11:39,594
You know how superstitious
these players are.

88
00:11:40,261 --> 00:11:44,307
l have a quarterback that's put his
socks on backwards since high school.

89
00:11:44,557 --> 00:11:48,645
l've got a linebacker that hasn't washed
his jockey strap in two years...

90
00:11:48,895 --> 00:11:51,606
... because he thinks flies are lucky.

91
00:11:51,939 --> 00:11:55,567
l want that fish on that field
Super Bowl Sunday.

92
00:11:55,818 --> 00:11:57,320
Find the fish...

93
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,239
... or find new jobs!

94
00:11:59,489 --> 00:12:02,367
Why did it happen now,
two weeks before the Super Bowl?

95
00:12:02,575 --> 00:12:05,535
l'll tell you, it's those
animal-rights activists!

96
00:12:05,744 --> 00:12:07,497
Always out with their signs:

97
00:12:07,747 --> 00:12:10,666
"Animals were born free!
Stop torturing Snowflake!"

98
00:12:10,874 --> 00:12:12,960
That fish lives better than they do.

99
00:12:13,169 --> 00:12:17,840
The police are checking into the animal-
rights groups. Have they called back?

100
00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:21,343
No, but l wanted to tell you,
when l lost my Cuddles...

101
00:12:21,593 --> 00:12:23,387
... l hired a pet detective.

102
00:12:23,971 --> 00:12:24,972
A what?

103
00:12:25,389 --> 00:12:27,725
A pet detective.

104
00:12:29,143 --> 00:12:32,103
Thanks, Martha, but we better
leave this to professionals.

105
00:12:32,395 --> 00:12:34,523
Well, actually, he was quite good.

106
00:12:34,773 --> 00:12:39,402
Pet detection is a very involved,
highly scientific process.

107
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,625
Like a glove!

108
00:13:45,843 --> 00:13:47,970
Mr. Ventura here to see you.

109
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,057
Thanks, Martha.

110
00:13:50,265 --> 00:13:51,850
Hi, l'm Melissa Robinson.

111
00:13:52,059 --> 00:13:53,351
Pleasure to meet you.

112
00:13:53,893 --> 00:13:55,479
Any trouble getting in?

113
00:13:55,812 --> 00:13:59,942
No, the guy with the rubber glove
was surprisingly gentle.

114
00:14:00,317 --> 00:14:02,110
Security's tight Super Bowl week.

115
00:14:03,361 --> 00:14:06,698
Why don't you have a seat?
l'll get right to the point.

116
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:12,037
Our mascot was stolen from his tank last
night. Are you familiar with Snowflake?

117
00:14:12,287 --> 00:14:13,455
Negative.

118
00:14:13,705 --> 00:14:17,334
We got him from Miami.
He's a rare bottle-nosed dolphin.

119
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:20,879
This is a new trick he was
going to do for the halftime show.

120
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:22,088
<i>Let's go.</i>

121
00:14:22,421 --> 00:14:24,341
<i>Blue 42, blue 42!</i>

122
00:14:24,591 --> 00:14:25,758
<i>Hut, hut!</i>

123
00:14:29,512 --> 00:14:30,430
<i>All right!</i>

124
00:14:35,685 --> 00:14:37,353
<i>Come on, let's go!</i>

125
00:14:42,191 --> 00:14:43,859
<i>Good boy!</i>

126
00:14:52,284 --> 00:14:53,744
Would you like an ashtray?

127
00:14:55,371 --> 00:14:56,706
l don't smoke.

128
00:14:56,955 --> 00:14:59,042
lt's a disgusting habit.

129
00:15:05,047 --> 00:15:06,424
The police came today.

130
00:15:06,715 --> 00:15:09,844
Apparently, the kidnappers
came in through the back with a--

131
00:15:10,386 --> 00:15:13,263
Four-wheel-drive van,
loaded from the rear.

132
00:15:14,682 --> 00:15:16,267
Roger, how you holding up?

133
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:20,521
lf l'm walking funny it's because
l got two dozen reporters up my ass.

134
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:23,815
They've been asking me
about Snowflake all morning.

135
00:15:26,944 --> 00:15:28,070
Who's he?

136
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,740
Roger Podacter, meet Ace Ventura.

137
00:15:31,115 --> 00:15:32,825
He's our pet detective.

138
00:15:33,617 --> 00:15:37,914
Nice to meet you. You came very
highly recommended by Martha Mertz.

139
00:15:38,164 --> 00:15:39,539
Martha Mertz?

140
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,375
Oh, yeah, the bitch!

141
00:15:44,003 --> 00:15:48,299
Pekingese, lost in Highland Park area.
She was half-dead when l found her.

142
00:15:48,549 --> 00:15:49,884
ls that the tank?

143
00:15:50,676 --> 00:15:51,926
Excuse me.

144
00:16:01,853 --> 00:16:04,356
-Cops drain it?
-Yes, this morning.

145
00:16:06,358 --> 00:16:08,401
lf l'm not back in five minutes...

146
00:16:08,651 --> 00:16:10,112
... just wait longer.

147
00:16:26,294 --> 00:16:31,215
Captain's log, stardate 23.9, rounded
off to the nearest decimal point.

148
00:16:31,507 --> 00:16:36,637
We've traveled back in time to save
an ancient species from annihilation.

149
00:16:37,055 --> 00:16:38,015
So far...

150
00:16:38,223 --> 00:16:42,518
... no signs of aquatic life,
but l am going to find it.

151
00:16:42,727 --> 00:16:45,981
lf l have to tear another black hole,
l'm going to find it!

152
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:49,776
l've got to, mister!

153
00:17:01,329 --> 00:17:03,165
Oh, great!

154
00:17:03,832 --> 00:17:05,374
l'll try to head them off.

155
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,586
Ace, get out of the tank.

156
00:17:07,794 --> 00:17:09,464
l just can't do it, captain!

157
00:17:09,712 --> 00:17:11,630
l don't have the power!

158
00:17:14,384 --> 00:17:15,384
People!

159
00:17:15,718 --> 00:17:17,971
l said, get out of the tank now!

160
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,849
For God's sake, Jim,
l'm a doctor, not a pool man!

161
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:23,518
Where's Snowflake?

162
00:17:23,727 --> 00:17:26,729
Snowflake is not available right now.

163
00:17:26,937 --> 00:17:31,401
Roger, l've been waiting all day.
l got to get a shot of his new trick!

164
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:33,153
What, is he sick?

165
00:17:49,752 --> 00:17:51,253
People, people!

166
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,474
Lassie must be missing.

167
00:18:34,272 --> 00:18:35,731
Make any good collars lately?

168
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:37,692
Or were they leashes?

169
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:49,077
Homicide, Ventura.

170
00:18:50,413 --> 00:18:52,665
How are you gonna solve that one?

171
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:58,044
Good question, Aguado!

172
00:18:58,295 --> 00:18:59,713
First, l'd establish a motive.

173
00:18:59,963 --> 00:19:04,676
The killer saw the size of the bug's
dick and became insanely jealous.

174
00:19:07,804 --> 00:19:11,726
Then l'd lose 30 pounds
porking his wife!

175
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,186
Come on!

176
00:19:15,186 --> 00:19:18,148
Now, kiss and make up!

177
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:23,738
Excuse me.

178
00:19:23,988 --> 00:19:26,490
l'd like to ass you a few questions.

179
00:19:26,741 --> 00:19:28,533
This is not the time, Ace.

180
00:19:28,783 --> 00:19:33,371
lf Einhorn come down here and see me
talking to you or your ass, l'm history.

181
00:19:34,038 --> 00:19:38,751
l can keep him under control. You have
to tell me who's on the Snowflake case.

182
00:19:39,002 --> 00:19:42,423
l can't do nothing for you on that.
My hands are tied.

183
00:19:42,673 --> 00:19:46,010
All right, that's it!
Now it's my turn!

184
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,678
Five minutes alone, that's all l need!

185
00:19:48,928 --> 00:19:51,682
Better look alive.
Einhorn's on her way down.

186
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:54,434
Come on, now. Ace, please.

187
00:19:54,684 --> 00:19:58,814
What's that matter?
Afraid l'll make a stink? Come on!

188
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:01,275
Aguado's working the case, all right?

189
00:20:01,608 --> 00:20:02,734
Aguado!

190
00:20:03,944 --> 00:20:05,195
Good call!

191
00:20:05,486 --> 00:20:07,530
We're just a little busy now...

192
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:11,617
... with murderers and burglaries
and drug dealers. Things like that.

193
00:20:11,868 --> 00:20:14,830
A missing dolphin isn't exactly
a high priority.

194
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,419
Now you've pissed him off.

195
00:20:21,712 --> 00:20:24,840
-Would you give me a break?
-l can't hold him much longer!

196
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,091
My boss is coming!

197
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:29,218
Okay, look.

198
00:20:29,553 --> 00:20:32,180
We ran a check with local
animal-rights groups.

199
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:36,559
We checked out the taxidermists
and we already checked on van rentals.

200
00:20:36,809 --> 00:20:40,021
<i>So far, nothing, nathin', nada.
All right?</i>

201
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:42,523
Any unusual bets being made?

202
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:44,776
Of course! This is Super Bowl!

203
00:20:45,068 --> 00:20:47,611
-What'd you find out about the tank?
-Nothing.

204
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,073
Tire tracks, an escape route.
A guard didn't see anything.

205
00:20:52,241 --> 00:20:53,827
-That's it?
-l swear.

206
00:20:54,035 --> 00:20:57,288
Now will you please get out of here
before l get in trouble?

207
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:02,459
Thank you for your cooperation.

208
00:21:03,043 --> 00:21:05,672
By the way, do you have a mint?

209
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:08,132
Perhaps some Binaca?

210
00:21:20,477 --> 00:21:23,064
<i>Assholomio</i>

211
00:21:24,023 --> 00:21:26,150
<i>Osadomia</i>

212
00:21:29,446 --> 00:21:32,740
Holy testicle Tuesday!

213
00:21:33,533 --> 00:21:36,077
What the hell is he doing here?

214
00:21:36,493 --> 00:21:37,911
l came to confess.

215
00:21:38,496 --> 00:21:41,666
l was the second gunman
on the grassy knoll.

216
00:21:42,457 --> 00:21:46,838
Spare me the routine. l know
you're working the Snowflake case.

217
00:21:47,171 --> 00:21:51,008
May l suggest you yield
to the experts on this one?

218
00:21:51,301 --> 00:21:53,468
We'll find the porpoise.

219
00:21:56,472 --> 00:21:57,932
Now l feel better.

220
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:02,311
Of course, that might not do any good.

221
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,064
Nobody's missing a porpoise.
lt's a dolphin that's been taken.

222
00:22:06,314 --> 00:22:08,985
The common harbor
porpoise has an abrupt snout...

223
00:22:09,193 --> 00:22:13,281
... while the bottle-nosed dolphin,
or Tursiops truncatus...

224
00:22:13,489 --> 00:22:17,994
... has an elongated beak, cone-shaped
teeth and a serrated dorsal appendage.

225
00:22:18,244 --> 00:22:20,955
But l'm sure you already knew that.

226
00:22:21,289 --> 00:22:23,541
That's what turns me on about you.

227
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:25,375
Your attention to detail.

228
00:22:26,127 --> 00:22:27,961
Listen, pet dick...

229
00:22:28,546 --> 00:22:32,174
... how would you like me
to make your life a living hell?

230
00:22:33,008 --> 00:22:36,512
Well, l'm not really ready
for a relationship, Lois.

231
00:22:36,804 --> 00:22:38,722
But thank you for asking.

232
00:22:43,269 --> 00:22:45,270
Maybe l'll give you a call sometime.

233
00:22:45,478 --> 00:22:46,856
Your number still 911?

234
00:22:47,106 --> 00:22:48,941
Alrighty, then!

235
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:30,398
Excuse me. ls Greg here?

236
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,609
Thank you!

237
00:23:53,462 --> 00:23:55,298
What's the password?

238
00:23:55,549 --> 00:23:58,134
New England clam chowder.

239
00:23:58,634 --> 00:24:01,304
ls that the red or the white?

240
00:24:02,639 --> 00:24:04,473
l can never remember that!

241
00:24:05,474 --> 00:24:06,643
White?

242
00:24:10,939 --> 00:24:11,773
Hey, Woodstock!

243
00:24:11,982 --> 00:24:14,234
Hey, Saint Francis, how's it going?

244
00:24:14,484 --> 00:24:17,945
Super, thanks for asking.
l hope you're having a lovely day.

245
00:24:18,195 --> 00:24:19,197
Do you?

246
00:24:19,447 --> 00:24:20,657
Don't l?

247
00:24:21,616 --> 00:24:23,659
So what are you up to?

248
00:24:23,909 --> 00:24:26,453
Just watching the fishies.

249
00:24:26,663 --> 00:24:29,874
You see those blips?
That's a Norwegian whaling fleet.

250
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:33,961
l'm sending them new
directional coordinates.

251
00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:36,422
They'll find Jimmy Hoffa...

252
00:24:36,631 --> 00:24:38,465
... before they find any whales.

253
00:24:38,715 --> 00:24:43,304
Gravy! So can you still tap into
the aquatic supply stores in the area?

254
00:24:43,554 --> 00:24:44,888
Of course l can. Why?

255
00:24:45,139 --> 00:24:47,307
l wanna trace the sale of equipment...

256
00:24:47,558 --> 00:24:50,478
... for transporting or housing
a dolphin recently.

257
00:24:50,728 --> 00:24:53,815
Come on, l thought you had
a challenge for me.

258
00:24:54,107 --> 00:24:58,820
All right, we got marine winch, sling,
feeder fish, 20,000-gallon tank--

259
00:24:59,779 --> 00:25:02,114
Wait a minute. Look here.

260
00:25:02,948 --> 00:25:06,244
That's a lot of equipment
for a civilian.

261
00:25:06,577 --> 00:25:08,370
Ronald Camp? The billionaire?

262
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,040
Billionaire and rare-fish collector.

263
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:15,086
Really?

264
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:17,338
That is the face of the enemy.

265
00:25:18,046 --> 00:25:21,342
Always trying to get his greedy hands
on endangered species.

266
00:25:22,093 --> 00:25:23,093
Hold on.

267
00:25:23,301 --> 00:25:25,179
Camp is connected with the dolphins?

268
00:25:25,429 --> 00:25:29,057
That subgenius gave them the land
the stadium's built on.

269
00:25:29,391 --> 00:25:34,479
And look, he's throwing another "l'm
the richest man in the universe" party.

270
00:25:37,065 --> 00:25:40,486
Looks like it's time for me
to get myself a date.

271
00:25:46,157 --> 00:25:51,122
l'm really going out on a limb here.
His social events are strictly A-list.

272
00:25:51,413 --> 00:25:56,377
The date started good, Chuck, but before
we got to the party, she tensed up.

273
00:25:56,919 --> 00:25:59,129
lf you do anything to embarrass me...

274
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,256
What? Like this?

275
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,306
Hi, Captain Stubing.

276
00:26:09,556 --> 00:26:11,140
How are Gopher and Doc?

277
00:26:11,849 --> 00:26:13,852
Permission to come aboard, sir.

278
00:26:33,455 --> 00:26:34,998
l'm sorry, ladies.

279
00:26:38,293 --> 00:26:39,795
Glad you could make it.

280
00:26:40,087 --> 00:26:41,546
Thank you.

281
00:26:42,964 --> 00:26:44,174
You look wonderful.

282
00:26:46,343 --> 00:26:48,136
And who is he, a friend?

283
00:26:49,638 --> 00:26:52,307
No, this is--
This is my date.

284
00:26:54,101 --> 00:26:55,893
He's a lawyer.

285
00:26:56,143 --> 00:26:59,272
Does he have a name,
or should l call him "Lawyer"?

286
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:05,194
l'm sorry. This is Ace V--

287
00:27:06,654 --> 00:27:08,156
Tom Ace.

288
00:27:09,157 --> 00:27:10,575
Pleasure to meet you.

289
00:27:10,784 --> 00:27:12,786
Congratulations on all your success.

290
00:27:13,036 --> 00:27:14,538
You smell terrific!

291
00:27:15,163 --> 00:27:17,706
One of the first lessons we learned...

292
00:27:17,916 --> 00:27:19,042
... back at...

293
00:27:19,292 --> 00:27:24,422
... Stanford was the growth of food-
poisoning claims against wealthy-people.

294
00:27:24,713 --> 00:27:28,008
One could make quite
a lucrative law practice...

295
00:27:28,217 --> 00:27:29,468
... with little else.

296
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,765
How is everybody feeling tonight?

297
00:27:34,556 --> 00:27:36,559
Very, very well, thank you.

298
00:27:37,477 --> 00:27:38,645
Look, honey...

299
00:27:38,896 --> 00:27:40,646
... there's the hors d'oeuvres.

300
00:27:47,904 --> 00:27:51,532
Are you insane? There is no way
that Camp stole Snowflake.

301
00:27:52,075 --> 00:27:54,117
What are you trying to do?

302
00:27:58,539 --> 00:28:01,876
Will you keep him occupied
while l work my magic, please?

303
00:28:07,756 --> 00:28:09,383
Smooshy, isn't it?

304
00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:22,063
We got a few cases
from my new dealer in Paris.

305
00:28:23,147 --> 00:28:24,648
Excuse me, Ron...

306
00:28:24,898 --> 00:28:26,901
... l need to use the bathroom.

307
00:28:27,151 --> 00:28:29,362
l think it's the pâté.

308
00:28:29,612 --> 00:28:31,321
Sure, it's over there.

309
00:28:32,406 --> 00:28:35,242
Stuff probably looks better
on the way out.

310
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:45,211
He wasn't feeling well earlier today.

311
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,560
Gravy!

312
00:30:29,189 --> 00:30:30,857
Don't worry, Snowflake.

313
00:30:31,107 --> 00:30:32,817
Ace Ventura's here.

314
00:30:36,154 --> 00:30:37,446
Yummy!

315
00:30:56,674 --> 00:30:57,966
Snowflake!

316
00:30:59,552 --> 00:31:01,136
Here, Snowflake.

317
00:31:02,472 --> 00:31:04,474
l've got a snack for you.

318
00:31:18,946 --> 00:31:20,697
They're wonderful, aren't they?

319
00:31:21,406 --> 00:31:23,409
Yes, they certainly are.

320
00:31:24,243 --> 00:31:26,453
No matter what's going on in my life...

321
00:31:26,703 --> 00:31:28,748
... l can always watch them swim...

322
00:31:29,081 --> 00:31:31,417
... and be totally at peace.

323
00:31:38,841 --> 00:31:40,425
lt's not Snowflake!

324
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,887
lt's not Snowflake!

325
00:31:44,388 --> 00:31:47,058
lt's not Snowflake!

326
00:32:05,867 --> 00:32:07,953
Are you sure your date is all right?

327
00:32:08,204 --> 00:32:10,079
lt's been an awfully long time.

328
00:32:10,331 --> 00:32:11,664
Who, Tom?

329
00:32:11,915 --> 00:32:14,168
Well, l'm sure he's fine.

330
00:32:24,886 --> 00:32:26,889
Do not go in there!

331
00:32:40,735 --> 00:32:44,448
l'm sorry. l'll have the plumbing
checked immediately.

332
00:32:44,698 --> 00:32:48,785
Do that! lf l'd been drinking out
of the toilet, l might've been killed.

333
00:32:49,036 --> 00:32:51,163
l'm sorry again, Mr. Ace.

334
00:32:57,001 --> 00:32:58,462
What're you doing?

335
00:32:58,712 --> 00:33:00,213
l'm sorry, Ron.

336
00:33:00,464 --> 00:33:01,798
What's he doing?

337
00:33:02,049 --> 00:33:03,425
Let's go!

338
00:33:06,845 --> 00:33:08,305
Stop it!

339
00:33:09,513 --> 00:33:12,559
l don't even wanna know
why your pants are missing!

340
00:33:12,809 --> 00:33:14,602
You could've cost me my job!

341
00:33:15,311 --> 00:33:18,899
So you found a pebble
in Snowflake's tank. l'll call CNN.

342
00:33:19,149 --> 00:33:21,318
l found it in the filter, thank you.

343
00:33:21,568 --> 00:33:26,030
And it's not a pebble, it's a rare,
triangular cut orange amber.

344
00:33:27,699 --> 00:33:29,409
What're you talking about?

345
00:33:29,659 --> 00:33:32,871
Tonight l saw the same stone
in Camp's ring.

346
00:33:33,163 --> 00:33:35,248
l thought you said Camp didn't do it.

347
00:33:35,498 --> 00:33:37,917
No, his ring wasn't missing a stone.

348
00:33:38,126 --> 00:33:41,129
But whoever was in that tank
had a ring just like his.

349
00:33:41,337 --> 00:33:43,214
Ring? What ring?

350
00:33:45,884 --> 00:33:49,219
The 1984 Dolphin AFC championship ring.

351
00:33:51,014 --> 00:33:54,933
l find the ring with a missing stone,
l find Snowflake.

352
00:33:56,102 --> 00:33:57,854
How you gonna do that?

353
00:33:59,897 --> 00:34:01,232
Simple.

354
00:34:08,614 --> 00:34:09,449
Loser!

355
00:34:09,657 --> 00:34:11,909
Why don't you learn how to drive, pal?

356
00:34:13,911 --> 00:34:15,204
You wanna play?

357
00:34:25,131 --> 00:34:26,424
Damn it!

358
00:36:49,858 --> 00:36:51,943
That stone could've come from anywhere.

359
00:36:52,193 --> 00:36:53,862
lt could've come from...

360
00:36:54,112 --> 00:36:57,072
... a necklace or a pendant, an earring.

361
00:36:57,365 --> 00:37:01,618
lt came from an '84 AFC
championship ring.

362
00:37:05,707 --> 00:37:10,587
Einhorn thinks it may have been
an animal-rights group. You know FAN?

363
00:37:11,254 --> 00:37:16,009
Free Animals Now, started by Chelsea,
daughter of industrialist Fisher Gamble?

364
00:37:16,217 --> 00:37:18,261
Over half a million members worldwide?

365
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:20,387
No. Who are they?

366
00:37:21,264 --> 00:37:22,306
Did you know...

367
00:37:22,557 --> 00:37:26,853
... they sent letters to college teams
demanding the release of their mascots?

368
00:37:27,061 --> 00:37:28,604
What do you feed your dog?

369
00:37:30,355 --> 00:37:32,400
Dog food. Why?

370
00:37:32,608 --> 00:37:34,069
He is miserable!

371
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:36,027
What are you talking about?

372
00:37:36,236 --> 00:37:40,241
He's very unhappy. l feel sorry for him.
Bad diet, isolated environment.

373
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:42,577
lt's amazing he's still alive.

374
00:37:44,494 --> 00:37:48,833
You're just mad because your stupid
pebble theory didn't work out.

375
00:37:49,041 --> 00:37:50,418
You can't express anger.

376
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:53,296
Yeah? And you're ugly.

377
00:37:55,088 --> 00:37:58,134
l'm not even gonna talk to you.
Would you please leave?

378
00:37:58,384 --> 00:38:00,260
Why? So you can beat him?

379
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:01,554
Fatty!

380
00:38:02,388 --> 00:38:03,723
You're unbelievable!

381
00:38:03,972 --> 00:38:06,267
Hiring you was the biggest mistake
l ever made.

382
00:38:06,434 --> 00:38:09,352
Well, why don't you cry about it,
saddlebags?

383
00:38:14,275 --> 00:38:15,859
You like her, huh?

384
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:18,404
Yeah, she's all right.

385
00:38:27,955 --> 00:38:29,999
Look, Melissa, l...

386
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:37,881
l'm here at the North Beach Towers
condo complex in north Miami...

387
00:38:38,132 --> 00:38:41,844
... where Roger Podacter, head of
operations for the Miami Dolphins...

388
00:38:42,052 --> 00:38:44,137
... has apparently committed suicide...

389
00:38:44,429 --> 00:38:48,184
... allegedly leaping to his death
from his 20th-story balcony...

390
00:38:57,276 --> 00:38:58,694
You okay?

391
00:38:59,069 --> 00:39:01,572
l told you. l was in my apartment...

392
00:39:01,738 --> 00:39:02,989
... across the hall.

393
00:39:03,573 --> 00:39:05,325
l heard a scream...

394
00:39:05,575 --> 00:39:07,536
... so l called the manager.

395
00:39:08,077 --> 00:39:11,455
The place was empty, except for the dog.

396
00:39:11,707 --> 00:39:14,209
l opened the balcony door
and looked out...

397
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:16,586
... splat, bang, pancake time.

398
00:39:16,838 --> 00:39:18,921
Okay, thank you very much.

399
00:39:24,218 --> 00:39:25,595
Hi there, fella.

400
00:39:25,846 --> 00:39:27,264
Have a bad night?

401
00:39:38,149 --> 00:39:39,317
So...

402
00:39:39,692 --> 00:39:41,778
... animals can sense evil.

403
00:39:42,028 --> 00:39:43,863
Who let Dr. Doolittle in?

404
00:39:44,114 --> 00:39:46,616
Lieutenant, he came with Miss Robinson.

405
00:39:46,866 --> 00:39:51,746
This is police business. We'll let you
know if the coroner finds a tick.

406
00:39:54,541 --> 00:39:55,500
Face it--

407
00:39:55,709 --> 00:39:57,793
Forget it. She's right.

408
00:39:58,043 --> 00:39:59,045
Besides...

409
00:39:59,295 --> 00:40:03,799
... l wouldn't want someone tracing
my steps, pointing out my mistakes.

410
00:40:18,398 --> 00:40:19,648
So...

411
00:40:19,898 --> 00:40:23,695
... you don't think this is an obvious
suicide, Mr. Pet Detective?

412
00:40:24,278 --> 00:40:28,574
l wouldn't say that. There's plenty
of evidence here to support your theory.

413
00:40:28,825 --> 00:40:32,119
Except, of course, for that
spot of blood on the railing.

414
00:40:36,998 --> 00:40:39,252
May l tell you what l think happened?

415
00:40:39,502 --> 00:40:40,878
Alrighty, then!

416
00:40:41,088 --> 00:40:44,757
Roger Podacter went out after work,
had a few drinks, then came home.

417
00:40:45,007 --> 00:40:48,802
He wasn't alone. Someone else
was with him. There was a struggle...

418
00:40:49,011 --> 00:40:51,597
... and he was thrown over that balcony.

419
00:40:51,806 --> 00:40:54,308
Roger Podacter didn't commit suicide.

420
00:40:54,684 --> 00:40:56,309
He was murdered.

421
00:40:58,062 --> 00:41:00,356
That's a very entertaining story...

422
00:41:00,606 --> 00:41:04,819
... but real detectives have to worry
about that little thing called...

423
00:41:05,111 --> 00:41:06,611
... evidence.

424
00:41:08,948 --> 00:41:11,032
l think l heard a toilet flush.

425
00:41:11,282 --> 00:41:13,577
Maybe somebody lost a turtle.

426
00:41:17,163 --> 00:41:18,707
Well, l...

427
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:21,669
l guess l'm out of my league here.

428
00:41:23,879 --> 00:41:25,381
Good work.

429
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:36,642
There is just
one more thing, lieutenant.

430
00:41:37,434 --> 00:41:40,395
This woman is Roger Podacter's neighbor.

431
00:41:40,645 --> 00:41:42,940
She said she heard a scream. Right?

432
00:41:43,148 --> 00:41:46,150
And you had to open
the balcony door when you came in?

433
00:41:46,401 --> 00:41:49,906
-That's true.
-You're sure you had to open this door?

434
00:41:50,155 --> 00:41:51,155
l'm certain.

435
00:41:51,406 --> 00:41:53,408
What's the point, Ventura?

436
00:41:54,118 --> 00:41:56,035
Only this.

437
00:42:08,757 --> 00:42:12,135
This is double-paned, soundproof glass.
There is no way...

438
00:42:12,386 --> 00:42:15,973
... she could have heard
Podacter scream on the way down.

439
00:42:16,223 --> 00:42:18,558
The scream she heard
came from inside...

440
00:42:18,809 --> 00:42:23,688
... before he was thrown off the balcony.
The murderer closed the door upon going.

441
00:42:26,775 --> 00:42:28,860
Can you feel that, buddy?

442
00:42:30,945 --> 00:42:35,200
l have exorcized the demons!

443
00:42:37,369 --> 00:42:39,913
This house is clear.

444
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:42,958
-Losers.
-Get him out of here!

445
00:42:43,542 --> 00:42:46,711
-Losers! Losers!
-Let's go, Ace.

446
00:42:47,419 --> 00:42:48,630
Losers.

447
00:42:51,216 --> 00:42:52,217
Come on.

448
00:42:52,425 --> 00:42:54,218
Back to the zoo.

449
00:42:57,472 --> 00:42:58,973
What are you thinking?

450
00:42:59,765 --> 00:43:02,060
This whole thing is connected, somehow.

451
00:43:02,769 --> 00:43:05,187
l want to find that other ring.

452
00:43:07,107 --> 00:43:09,275
Ace, you checked all the rings.

453
00:43:09,526 --> 00:43:11,694
Receipts? What about receipts?

454
00:43:11,945 --> 00:43:13,613
There's gotta be receipts.

455
00:43:22,705 --> 00:43:26,084
That was pretty impressive,
what you did at the apartment.

456
00:43:26,833 --> 00:43:28,503
You don't have to tell me.

457
00:43:28,961 --> 00:43:30,505
l was there.

458
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:36,469
Maybe you should've joined the police
force, become a real detective.

459
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:38,637
l don't do humans.

460
00:43:40,932 --> 00:43:42,558
You really love animals.

461
00:43:44,351 --> 00:43:46,062
lf it gets cold enough.

462
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:50,607
No, l have a kinship with them.

463
00:43:50,858 --> 00:43:52,360
l understand them.

464
00:43:54,362 --> 00:43:56,280
Wanna hear something spooky?

465
00:43:56,489 --> 00:43:57,740
Sure.

466
00:44:00,451 --> 00:44:04,789
One time when l was about 12, l had
a dream that l was being followed by...

467
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:06,832
... a big dog with rabies.

468
00:44:07,083 --> 00:44:09,000
He had these bloodshot eyes...

469
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:11,045
... and foam came out of his mouth.

470
00:44:11,462 --> 00:44:16,384
No matter how fast l ran, he just kept
gaining on me and gaining on me.

471
00:44:18,635 --> 00:44:21,472
Then just before l got
to my front door...

472
00:44:21,806 --> 00:44:24,307
... he jumped and sank his teeth in.

473
00:44:26,352 --> 00:44:28,229
That's when l woke up...

474
00:44:28,479 --> 00:44:31,565
... and felt the back of my neck.
Check that out.

475
00:44:34,817 --> 00:44:36,153
Bastard!

476
00:44:37,487 --> 00:44:40,157
l'm sorry, l just couldn't help myself.

477
00:44:41,075 --> 00:44:42,742
Want to know why l do this?

478
00:44:42,951 --> 00:44:44,703
l'm not sure anymore.

479
00:44:44,912 --> 00:44:46,413
You better be sure...

480
00:44:47,122 --> 00:44:49,625
... because once you get
inside my head...

481
00:44:49,917 --> 00:44:51,586
... there's no turning back.

482
00:45:03,179 --> 00:45:04,180
So...

483
00:45:06,183 --> 00:45:08,393
Are these all? There's only a dozen.

484
00:45:08,644 --> 00:45:10,729
Maybe it's in another file,
in the back.

485
00:45:10,979 --> 00:45:12,606
Who the hell is that?

486
00:45:13,023 --> 00:45:14,274
What?

487
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,613
That.

488
00:45:20,196 --> 00:45:22,198
Who the hell is that?

489
00:45:22,865 --> 00:45:26,286
That's Ray Finkle, the kicker.
Don't you know who he is?

490
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:29,831
Why isn't he in this picture?

491
00:45:34,211 --> 00:45:39,132
This was taken earlier in the year.
Ray Finkle wasn't added till mid-season.

492
00:45:44,513 --> 00:45:48,099
He missed the final field goal
in the Super Bowl that year.

493
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:49,976
Cost the Dolphins the game.

494
00:45:50,393 --> 00:45:52,646
But he got himself a ring, didn't he?

495
00:45:53,939 --> 00:45:55,190
Definitely.

496
00:45:55,398 --> 00:45:58,276
"Replacement kicker
having a great year."

497
00:45:58,526 --> 00:46:01,236
"Ready for Super Bowl,
all-star kicker boasts."

498
00:46:01,445 --> 00:46:04,824
"Field goal sails wide,
Dolphins lose Super Bowl."

499
00:46:05,284 --> 00:46:07,911
"The kick heard round the world."

500
00:46:08,161 --> 00:46:11,538
That was Finkle.
The Dolphins lost by one point.

501
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:15,460
Poor guy.

502
00:46:15,669 --> 00:46:17,961
Poor guy with a motive, baby.

503
00:46:18,338 --> 00:46:19,881
Where is he now?

504
00:46:20,215 --> 00:46:23,342
l heard he went back
to his hometown in Collier County.

505
00:46:24,219 --> 00:46:27,847
Really?

506
00:46:30,016 --> 00:46:32,185
You're gonna drop me off before you go?

507
00:46:33,102 --> 00:46:35,812
No way. You shouldn't be
left alone right now.

508
00:46:36,063 --> 00:46:38,650
lt might not be safe at your apartment.

509
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,193
What do you suggest?

510
00:47:25,612 --> 00:47:27,156
Oh, my God!

511
00:47:28,073 --> 00:47:29,700
Oh, my God.

512
00:47:31,159 --> 00:47:32,995
Three times?

513
00:47:33,579 --> 00:47:36,289
l'm sorry, that's never
happened to me before.

514
00:47:37,081 --> 00:47:38,834
l must be tired.

515
00:47:42,337 --> 00:47:44,089
Okay, l'm ready again.

516
00:48:36,224 --> 00:48:38,144
l'm looking for Ray Finkle...

517
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:41,188
... and a clean pair of shorts.

518
00:48:41,396 --> 00:48:44,315
What do you know about Ray Finkle?

519
00:48:46,401 --> 00:48:49,529
Soccer-style kicker.
Graduated from Collier High, 1976.

520
00:48:49,779 --> 00:48:53,532
Stetson University honors graduate,
1980. Holds two NCAA records.

521
00:48:53,783 --> 00:48:55,368
Most points and distance.

522
00:48:55,576 --> 00:48:58,454
Nickname, "The Mule."
The only pro athlete from here.

523
00:48:58,662 --> 00:49:01,541
And one hell of a model American.

524
00:49:07,339 --> 00:49:10,091
<i>Are you another one of them
Hard Copy guys?</i>

525
00:49:10,342 --> 00:49:11,384
No, sir.

526
00:49:11,593 --> 00:49:13,093
l'm just a big Finkle fan.

527
00:49:14,846 --> 00:49:17,098
This is my Graceland, sir.

528
00:49:17,932 --> 00:49:20,018
Will you put that gun down?

529
00:49:20,602 --> 00:49:23,646
The boy is a fan of our son.

530
00:49:24,855 --> 00:49:26,608
So nice to meet you.

531
00:49:26,858 --> 00:49:28,318
l'm Ray's mother...

532
00:49:28,568 --> 00:49:30,277
... and this is Ray's father.

533
00:49:30,987 --> 00:49:32,821
lt's a real honor!

534
00:49:33,448 --> 00:49:36,409
lt's an honor to have you here.

535
00:49:38,076 --> 00:49:40,997
My Ray is so appreciative of his fans.

536
00:49:41,247 --> 00:49:43,750
He'll be so pleased you stopped by.

537
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,169
Are you expecting Ray anytime soon?

538
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:49,047
Oh, yes. l expect him home any minute.

539
00:49:49,756 --> 00:49:53,008
Would you like some cookies?
l just baked them.

540
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:54,927
Yummy!

541
00:50:01,225 --> 00:50:03,394
Ray Finkle's house.

542
00:50:04,729 --> 00:50:06,355
l can't wait to meet him.

543
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:11,235
Ray ain't coming home.

544
00:50:12,987 --> 00:50:15,113
But your wife expects him any minute.

545
00:50:15,323 --> 00:50:17,992
She expects him home any minute.

546
00:50:19,035 --> 00:50:22,829
See, the engine's running
but there's nobody behind the wheel.

547
00:50:24,331 --> 00:50:25,458
Eight years ago...

548
00:50:25,708 --> 00:50:29,795
... our son escaped from
Shady Acres Mental Hospital.

549
00:50:30,004 --> 00:50:32,881
And they're still bugging us
to pick up his stuff.

550
00:50:33,131 --> 00:50:36,760
lt was all that Dan Marino's fault.
Everyone knows that.

551
00:50:37,094 --> 00:50:40,306
lf he'd held the ball laces out,
like he's supposed to...

552
00:50:40,556 --> 00:50:42,933
... Ray wouldn't have missed the kick.

553
00:50:43,267 --> 00:50:47,479
Dan Marino should die
of gonorrhea and rot in hell.

554
00:50:47,730 --> 00:50:49,732
Would you like a cookie, son?

555
00:50:52,526 --> 00:50:53,944
What do you know?

556
00:50:54,486 --> 00:50:56,362
They're little footballs.

557
00:50:56,571 --> 00:50:57,948
Laces out.

558
00:50:59,491 --> 00:51:02,326
When Ray gets back and starts
kicking again...

559
00:51:02,577 --> 00:51:04,913
... he'll never even know he was gone.

560
00:51:05,164 --> 00:51:08,041
l've kept his room
just the way he left it.

561
00:51:30,564 --> 00:51:31,898
Oh, boy!

562
00:51:32,482 --> 00:51:34,943
What a sports nut, huh?

563
00:51:46,746 --> 00:51:47,706
May l?

564
00:51:47,956 --> 00:51:50,000
Oh, yes, by all means.

565
00:51:53,545 --> 00:51:56,840
<i>Five seconds to go here
in Super Bowl 17.</i>

566
00:51:57,089 --> 00:51:58,884
<i>Dolphins trailing the 49ers... </i>

567
00:51:59,092 --> 00:52:02,886
<i>... by one. This will
win the game for Miami.</i>

568
00:52:03,137 --> 00:52:04,806
<i>There's the snap.</i>

569
00:52:05,056 --> 00:52:06,266
<i>Marino holds.</i>

570
00:52:06,516 --> 00:52:07,684
<i>The kick... </i>

571
00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:10,394
<i>... and it's high. No, it's... </i>

572
00:52:10,602 --> 00:52:11,521
<i>... no good.</i>

573
00:52:11,771 --> 00:52:15,691
<i>Ray Finkle blew a 26-yard field goal!</i>

574
00:52:15,941 --> 00:52:17,819
<i>I don't believe it!</i>

575
00:52:18,028 --> 00:52:19,779
<i>The Dolphins lose!</i>

576
00:52:19,987 --> 00:52:24,200
<i>The Dolphins lose!
The Dolphins lose the Super Bowl!</i>

577
00:52:25,826 --> 00:52:28,246
<i>-Melissa, it's Ace!
-Where are you?</i>

578
00:52:28,496 --> 00:52:32,082
l'm in psychoville, and Finkle's
the mayor. Where's Marino?

579
00:52:32,333 --> 00:52:33,501
Why?

580
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:36,879
He's about to join Snowflake.
l've gotta know where he is!

581
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:41,342
He has a commercial shoot
at the Bogart Sound Stage.

582
00:52:41,551 --> 00:52:44,636
Call the police. Get extra
security over there. Now!

583
00:52:44,886 --> 00:52:46,848
Ace, what's going on?

584
00:52:49,975 --> 00:52:51,060
Thought l left?

585
00:52:53,104 --> 00:52:54,896
l'm really gonna go this time.

586
00:53:03,573 --> 00:53:05,740
Here we go, folks. Very quiet.

587
00:53:05,991 --> 00:53:06,868
Action!

588
00:53:07,118 --> 00:53:11,162
l'm Dan Marino, and if anyone knows
the value of protection, it's me.

589
00:53:17,336 --> 00:53:20,464
So l take care of the hands
that take care of me...

590
00:53:21,132 --> 00:53:22,425
... with lsotoner gloves!

591
00:53:22,675 --> 00:53:24,592
Cut! Again from the top.

592
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:25,886
l said, cut!

593
00:53:26,137 --> 00:53:27,430
Guys, it's a cut!

594
00:53:27,639 --> 00:53:30,015
What the hell are they doing?

595
00:53:30,266 --> 00:53:31,892
That's a cut!

596
00:53:36,981 --> 00:53:39,524
-What is this, a rewrite?
-Shut up!

597
00:53:43,863 --> 00:53:45,405
-Where'd they go?
-Over there!

598
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:46,657
Let's go!

599
00:53:53,746 --> 00:53:55,332
Excuse me, gentlemen!

600
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,709
Pet detective!

601
00:54:05,384 --> 00:54:06,385
Come on!

602
00:54:06,593 --> 00:54:07,886
What's wrong?

603
00:54:08,094 --> 00:54:09,595
Can't you hit me?

604
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,001
Have there been ransom demands?

605
00:54:39,251 --> 00:54:41,712
There's no communication
with the kidnappers.

606
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,880
Will the Super Bowl be postponed?

607
00:54:44,131 --> 00:54:45,632
The game is on as scheduled.

608
00:54:45,882 --> 00:54:47,800
Why weren't we told
about the kidnapping?

609
00:54:48,008 --> 00:54:51,054
Secrecy was essential.
We couldn't risk any interference.

610
00:54:51,263 --> 00:54:55,267
-Are the crimes related?
-l'm sorry, l can't comment further.

611
00:54:55,517 --> 00:54:57,435
Now, if you'll excuse me...

612
00:54:59,353 --> 00:55:01,690
Get me the autopsy on Podacter!

613
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:04,775
Aguado, send out a memo:
No one talks to the press!

614
00:55:05,026 --> 00:55:07,612
And somebody get me some coffee!

615
00:55:07,862 --> 00:55:11,741
<i>Tonight on Miami Vice,
Crockett gets the boss a coffee!</i>

616
00:55:13,243 --> 00:55:17,204
When l get out of that bathroom,
you'd better be gone!

617
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:19,874
ls it number one or number two?

618
00:55:20,166 --> 00:55:22,376
l just wanna know how much time l have.

619
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:27,423
By the way,
l went ahead and solved that...

620
00:55:27,673 --> 00:55:30,635
... pesky Snowflake-Podacter-
Marino thing.

621
00:55:31,345 --> 00:55:35,014
You ever heard of a former
Dolphin kicker named Ray Finkle?

622
00:55:41,855 --> 00:55:43,648
All right, Ventura...

623
00:55:44,899 --> 00:55:46,109
... make it quick.

624
00:55:46,483 --> 00:55:49,612
l found a rare stone
at the bottom of Snowflake's tank.

625
00:55:49,862 --> 00:55:52,532
lt belongs to a Dolphin '84 AFC
championship ring.

626
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:55,910
lt would've been a Super Bowl ring,
but Ray missed the kick.

627
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:58,121
Blames the whole thing on Marino.

628
00:55:58,371 --> 00:56:03,000
We're talking paranoid, delusional
psychosis. l saw the guy's room.

629
00:56:03,209 --> 00:56:05,461
Cozy, if you're Hannibal Lecter.

630
00:56:06,337 --> 00:56:08,631
So how does Roger Podacter fit in?

631
00:56:09,173 --> 00:56:13,845
My guess is, Finkle was snooping around.
Podacter recognized him. End of story.

632
00:56:14,053 --> 00:56:18,724
As for Snowflake, they gave him Finkle's
number, taught him how to kick a goal.

633
00:56:18,933 --> 00:56:20,768
Finkle took it personally.

634
00:56:23,104 --> 00:56:24,897
So where is Finkle now?

635
00:56:25,106 --> 00:56:29,568
Busted out of a mental institute. He's
been plotting his revenge for years.

636
00:56:29,819 --> 00:56:32,488
Waiting for the perfect time
to get back at them.

637
00:56:32,697 --> 00:56:34,574
The time when it'd hurt them most:

638
00:56:34,783 --> 00:56:36,950
Super Bowl time.

639
00:56:37,201 --> 00:56:39,578
Man, l'm tired of being right!

640
00:56:43,958 --> 00:56:45,584
Congratulations.

641
00:56:46,793 --> 00:56:49,630
You've done some fine detective work...

642
00:56:51,507 --> 00:56:52,715
... Ace.

643
00:56:54,385 --> 00:56:57,012
l'm sorry, could you
speak into my good ear?

644
00:56:57,263 --> 00:56:59,390
l thought l heard you call me Ace.

645
00:56:59,932 --> 00:57:04,561
Maybe l was wrong about you.
Maybe you are more than just a pet dick.

646
00:57:12,778 --> 00:57:15,405
Your gun is digging into my hip.

647
00:57:15,655 --> 00:57:17,116
What's wrong?

648
00:57:17,366 --> 00:57:19,828
Want me to read you your rights?

649
00:57:20,785 --> 00:57:22,412
Maybe later.

650
00:57:25,582 --> 00:57:26,707
What is it?

651
00:57:26,958 --> 00:57:28,544
That bony little bitch...

652
00:57:28,794 --> 00:57:30,504
... Melissa Robinson?

653
00:57:31,213 --> 00:57:33,298
You just don't do anything for me.

654
00:57:34,757 --> 00:57:36,009
Down, boy!

655
00:57:38,095 --> 00:57:40,806
Everything okay in here?
l heard some commotion.

656
00:57:41,265 --> 00:57:42,849
Fine, sergeant.

657
00:57:43,225 --> 00:57:44,976
You want me to throw him out?

658
00:57:45,811 --> 00:57:48,314
Why don't you throw yourself out?

659
00:57:50,314 --> 00:57:51,608
Yes, ma'am.

660
00:57:54,777 --> 00:57:57,739
Ace, l want you to leave
everything to us.

661
00:57:57,989 --> 00:58:01,242
l can't do that, lieutenant.
l was hired to find Snowflake.

662
00:58:01,493 --> 00:58:03,161
When we find Marino...

663
00:58:03,411 --> 00:58:05,455
... we'll deliver Snowflake.

664
00:58:05,705 --> 00:58:07,791
When l find Snowflake...

665
00:58:09,208 --> 00:58:11,002
... l'll deliver Marino.

666
00:58:23,139 --> 00:58:24,348
Melissa, it's Ace!

667
00:58:24,598 --> 00:58:27,477
What are you doing here?
lt's the middle of the night.

668
00:58:28,229 --> 00:58:30,229
You have to commit me.

669
00:58:31,398 --> 00:58:34,858
Finkle escaped from Shady Acres.
They still have his stuff.

670
00:58:35,109 --> 00:58:37,362
They aren't gonna let us look around.

671
00:58:37,612 --> 00:58:38,696
l know.

672
00:58:38,947 --> 00:58:41,783
lt's a good thing
l'm a master of disguise.

673
00:58:42,033 --> 00:58:43,076
Mrs. Robinson...

674
00:58:43,409 --> 00:58:45,453
... l'm Dr. Handly.

675
00:58:45,702 --> 00:58:48,122
Now who is it you want us to look at?

676
00:58:48,373 --> 00:58:49,624
My brother...

677
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:51,459
... Larry.

678
00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:58,174
l'm ready to go in.
Just give me a chance!

679
00:58:58,382 --> 00:59:01,344
l know there's a lot riding on it,
but it's all psychological.

680
00:59:01,636 --> 00:59:03,345
Just gotta stay positive.

681
00:59:05,515 --> 00:59:08,683
l'm gonna execute
a buttonhook pattern, super slow-mo.

682
00:59:36,712 --> 00:59:38,004
Let's see that...

683
00:59:38,254 --> 00:59:39,882
... in an instant replay.

684
00:59:55,231 --> 00:59:58,526
Your brother won't be
the first football pro we've treated.

685
00:59:58,776 --> 01:00:01,487
-ls that right?
-Yes, we're very sensitive...

686
01:00:01,737 --> 01:00:04,198
... to the stress athletes
have to endure.

687
01:00:04,448 --> 01:00:06,408
l'm open! l'm open!

688
01:00:07,242 --> 01:00:08,953
l'm open!

689
01:00:09,787 --> 01:00:12,288
We'll do some preliminary evaluations...

690
01:00:12,538 --> 01:00:14,708
... but l think he'll fit in nicely here.

691
01:00:14,958 --> 01:00:16,543
Over here!

692
01:00:18,754 --> 01:00:20,464
35 1!

693
01:00:20,923 --> 01:00:22,715
35 1!

694
01:00:22,965 --> 01:00:24,927
Rover, sit! Hut, hut!

695
01:00:28,179 --> 01:00:31,141
He seems to have some difficulty
letting go of the game.

696
01:00:31,643 --> 01:00:33,726
Has he had a history of mental illness?

697
01:00:35,187 --> 01:00:36,980
As long as l've known him.

698
01:00:38,899 --> 01:00:41,526
This is one of our therapy rooms.

699
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:45,822
And we do arts and crafts
out here in the courtyard.

700
01:00:46,073 --> 01:00:49,994
And this is the storage room.
Down the hallway we have another--

701
01:00:50,244 --> 01:00:51,744
Halftime!

702
01:01:05,717 --> 01:01:09,638
He'll be fine there by himself
for the next 20 minutes.

703
01:01:11,223 --> 01:01:13,557
l'll show you the dormitories, then.

704
01:02:25,254 --> 01:02:27,047
lsotoners.

705
01:02:46,442 --> 01:02:48,779
Obsess much?

706
01:02:50,403 --> 01:02:52,031
Where are you going?

707
01:02:52,281 --> 01:02:55,283
-To clean the storage room.
-No, clean the cafeteria.

708
01:02:55,492 --> 01:02:57,578
l don't tell you how to do your job.

709
01:02:57,828 --> 01:02:59,455
The schedule says...

710
01:02:59,705 --> 01:03:02,124
-... clean the cafeteria.
-l know what l'm doing.

711
01:03:02,374 --> 01:03:03,626
You should've done it earlier.

712
01:03:03,876 --> 01:03:07,129
Man, come on. Cafeteria, my ass!
l'm cleaning in here!

713
01:03:07,338 --> 01:03:09,422
You take breaks too long. You smoke--

714
01:03:09,673 --> 01:03:11,926
Man, you're a pain in the ass!

715
01:03:34,698 --> 01:03:37,201
"Search called off for missing hiker."

716
01:03:37,868 --> 01:03:40,370
"A search ended today
when rescue workers...

717
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:44,208
... were unable to find the body
of Lois Einhorn."

718
01:03:45,834 --> 01:03:48,003
A hiker missing since Friday?

719
01:03:48,253 --> 01:03:49,838
Lois Einhorn?

720
01:03:51,214 --> 01:03:53,841
Holy shitballs!

721
01:04:07,648 --> 01:04:10,400
What're you doing out here?
Get back to work!

722
01:04:39,554 --> 01:04:40,847
"Love, Roger"?

723
01:04:49,396 --> 01:04:50,648
<i>Ace, it's E.</i>

724
01:04:50,857 --> 01:04:53,985
<i>You think the article you found
was something?</i>

725
01:04:54,234 --> 01:04:56,738
<i>I got a note from Roger to Einhorn... </i>

726
01:04:56,988 --> 01:04:59,324
<i>... thanking her for a wonderful evening.</i>

727
01:04:59,574 --> 01:05:02,160
<i>Something ain't stirring
the Kool-Aid, man.</i>

728
01:05:02,409 --> 01:05:04,287
Wiggles, rewind.

729
01:05:08,458 --> 01:05:11,836
What the hell does Lois Einhorn
have to do with Ray Finkle?

730
01:05:13,629 --> 01:05:15,214
Come on, think!

731
01:05:15,423 --> 01:05:18,592
Finkle and Einhorn, in it together.
How? Why?

732
01:05:25,725 --> 01:05:27,268
All right! Here we go.

733
01:05:27,518 --> 01:05:30,730
Answer's right there!
Just gotta get blood to the brain!

734
01:05:31,314 --> 01:05:33,982
Finkle and Einhorn! Finkle and Einhorn!

735
01:05:34,191 --> 01:05:36,569
Finkle and Einhorn! Finkle and Einhorn!

736
01:05:50,709 --> 01:05:52,042
Quitter!

737
01:05:54,211 --> 01:05:56,131
What do you want?

738
01:05:57,672 --> 01:06:00,217
l don't have any food for you.

739
01:06:00,676 --> 01:06:03,344
l have to have money to buy food.

740
01:06:03,596 --> 01:06:06,974
l have to have a dolphin to get money.
Do you see a dolphin here?

741
01:06:15,441 --> 01:06:16,692
Let's face it...

742
01:06:16,942 --> 01:06:18,986
... your master is a loser.

743
01:06:36,086 --> 01:06:38,046
What the...?

744
01:06:40,007 --> 01:06:41,925
That's it.

745
01:06:44,094 --> 01:06:45,637
That's it!

746
01:06:45,929 --> 01:06:48,432
Einhorn is Finkle.

747
01:06:48,682 --> 01:06:51,059
Finkle is Einhorn!

748
01:06:51,351 --> 01:06:53,729
Einhorn is a man!

749
01:06:55,230 --> 01:06:57,232
Oh, my God!

750
01:06:57,649 --> 01:07:00,235
Einhorn is a man!

751
01:07:56,833 --> 01:07:59,210
"Your gun is digging into my hip."

752
01:08:00,170 --> 01:08:01,545
God!

753
01:08:03,131 --> 01:08:07,719
<i>And the big story in this
Super Bowl game is the abduction... </i>

754
01:08:07,927 --> 01:08:11,014
<i>... of Miami's starting quarterback,
Dan Marino.</i>

755
01:08:11,264 --> 01:08:14,391
<i>It's gotta be a strain
on this Miami team, Bob... </i>

756
01:08:52,722 --> 01:08:56,225
What's the matter, Dan?
Aren't you having fun?

757
01:08:56,434 --> 01:09:00,271
l just love Super Bowl Sunday.
Don't you, Dan?

758
01:09:00,521 --> 01:09:02,816
A magical afternoon...

759
01:09:03,191 --> 01:09:05,443
... where dreams are made...

760
01:09:06,527 --> 01:09:08,029
... and crushed.

761
01:09:08,362 --> 01:09:11,866
Look, if you want tickets,
you're going about it the wrong way.

762
01:09:13,409 --> 01:09:16,996
Do l look familiar to you?
Does it seem as if we've...

763
01:09:17,204 --> 01:09:19,373
... met someplace before?

764
01:09:19,790 --> 01:09:22,376
l don't know.
l get hit in the head a lot.

765
01:09:22,876 --> 01:09:25,045
<i>Now the coin toss.</i>

766
01:09:25,796 --> 01:09:27,047
Kickoff time.

767
01:09:28,047 --> 01:09:29,675
My favorite thing.

768
01:09:36,348 --> 01:09:37,890
Laces out!

769
01:09:57,160 --> 01:10:00,664
l made some refreshments, Dan.

770
01:10:01,957 --> 01:10:04,459
Would you like some refreshments, Dan?

771
01:10:05,669 --> 01:10:07,670
l'll be right back, Dan.

772
01:10:37,826 --> 01:10:41,996
l don't know how much psycho-woman's
paying you, but l'll double it.

773
01:10:42,246 --> 01:10:45,459
Sorry.
"Psycho-woman" keeps us out of prison.

774
01:10:46,543 --> 01:10:48,420
Snowflake, here you go. Come on.

775
01:10:48,628 --> 01:10:50,338
Check it out, Marino.

776
01:10:50,548 --> 01:10:52,881
l'm throwing passes to a dolphin.

777
01:11:03,308 --> 01:11:04,144
Damn!

778
01:11:04,352 --> 01:11:06,145
Go get some more fish!

779
01:11:06,479 --> 01:11:08,022
l'm gonna kill that dolphin.

780
01:11:09,315 --> 01:11:10,942
Lovely party.

781
01:11:11,192 --> 01:11:12,944
Pity l wasn't invited.

782
01:11:25,457 --> 01:11:27,542
Where the hell's the smelt?

783
01:11:35,216 --> 01:11:38,511
Unconscious. Exactly as l planned.

784
01:11:46,227 --> 01:11:47,687
What the hell was that?

785
01:11:58,823 --> 01:11:59,907
Shit!

786
01:12:05,662 --> 01:12:08,666
What happened? What's going on?

787
01:12:08,916 --> 01:12:09,876
You okay?

788
01:12:10,418 --> 01:12:11,459
Guess what?

789
01:12:11,876 --> 01:12:12,920
lt's naptime!

790
01:12:15,589 --> 01:12:17,048
<i>What a hit!</i>

791
01:12:19,969 --> 01:12:21,303
Heads up!

792
01:12:27,643 --> 01:12:28,769
Who are you?

793
01:12:30,019 --> 01:12:33,441
Ace Ventura, Pet Detective.
l've been sent with a special play:

794
01:12:33,692 --> 01:12:35,316
The quarterback sneak.

795
01:12:36,402 --> 01:12:37,236
Penalty!

796
01:12:37,778 --> 01:12:40,613
Too many men on the field.

797
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:43,242
l warned you, Ventura.

798
01:12:43,993 --> 01:12:45,493
Whatever happened to "Ace"?

799
01:12:45,701 --> 01:12:47,496
Good question.

800
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:52,584
Be careful with that phone.
ln time, you could develop a tumor.

801
01:12:53,210 --> 01:12:55,546
Aguado, it's Lieutenant Einhorn.

802
01:12:55,796 --> 01:12:59,550
Send some men over
to the Hallandale yacht basin.

803
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:02,219
l've got the kidnapper
trapped in the warehouse.

804
01:13:02,761 --> 01:13:05,347
lt's Ace Ventura, Pet Detective.

805
01:13:09,017 --> 01:13:12,187
<i>Code 11 in progress,
343 Victorville Road... </i>

806
01:13:12,437 --> 01:13:14,022
<i>... at the Palmdale basin.</i>

807
01:13:14,231 --> 01:13:17,526
<i>Officer needs backup.
Suspect's name: Ace Ventura... </i>

808
01:13:17,776 --> 01:13:20,361
<i>... should be considered
armed and dangerous.</i>

809
01:13:21,071 --> 01:13:23,741
lt's Ace. We gotta break out of here.

810
01:13:26,368 --> 01:13:27,702
ls he in trouble?

811
01:13:27,953 --> 01:13:30,372
Don't worry, if there's
one thing l know...

812
01:13:30,621 --> 01:13:32,833
... there's nothing Ace can't handle.

813
01:13:33,458 --> 01:13:35,752
Don't kill me!

814
01:13:37,337 --> 01:13:39,047
Please!

815
01:13:39,506 --> 01:13:41,800
l'll never tell anyone, l swear.

816
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:44,386
-He's who you want! Kill him!
-Kill him!

817
01:13:44,636 --> 01:13:47,390
Kill him! He held the ball, remember?

818
01:13:47,639 --> 01:13:49,223
Come on, look at him!

819
01:13:49,473 --> 01:13:50,725
-Crybaby!
-Jock!

820
01:13:50,976 --> 01:13:51,893
-Wimp.
-Musclehead.

821
01:13:52,143 --> 01:13:53,644
Shut up!

822
01:13:53,894 --> 01:13:58,275
l think l'll kill the dolphin first.
l wouldn't want you to miss that.

823
01:13:58,857 --> 01:14:00,652
<i>And there's the snap.</i>

824
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:01,778
<i>The kick!</i>

825
01:14:02,028 --> 01:14:04,072
<i>And it's good!</i>

826
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:07,200
Good to see somebody who
doesn't buckle under the pressure!

827
01:14:12,163 --> 01:14:16,584
What would you know about pressure?

828
01:14:16,876 --> 01:14:19,420
Well, l have kissed a man.

829
01:14:20,338 --> 01:14:24,759
<i>Of course, there's never been
a more crucial kick in a Super Bowl... </i>

830
01:14:25,051 --> 01:14:27,303
<i>... than the "kick
heard around the world. "</i>

831
01:14:27,804 --> 01:14:32,892
<i>I mean, it's clear to me that it was
a good hold. Finkle just booted it.</i>

832
01:14:33,975 --> 01:14:35,478
The laces were in!

833
01:14:35,937 --> 01:14:37,564
They were in!

834
01:14:57,832 --> 01:14:59,460
You like that?

835
01:14:59,710 --> 01:15:00,879
You like that?

836
01:15:06,385 --> 01:15:08,259
And that! And that!

837
01:15:18,812 --> 01:15:21,190
Having a little trouble with the lady?

838
01:15:21,607 --> 01:15:23,067
You don't understand...

839
01:15:23,317 --> 01:15:24,527
... she's a--

840
01:15:27,530 --> 01:15:29,448
Get him, Lois! Get him!

841
01:15:33,369 --> 01:15:34,787
Get him!

842
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:42,502
Shoot him!

843
01:15:44,546 --> 01:15:46,590
-Shoot him!
-Hold your fire!

844
01:15:48,384 --> 01:15:49,551
Don't shoot!

845
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:52,012
Put your guns down, or this cop gets it!

846
01:15:52,804 --> 01:15:54,264
l mean it!

847
01:15:54,723 --> 01:15:56,934
She's not joking!

848
01:15:57,142 --> 01:15:58,685
He kidnapped Snowflake!

849
01:15:58,936 --> 01:16:03,524
He killed Roger Podacter and was about
to kill Marino and me!

850
01:16:06,401 --> 01:16:08,904
Fiction can be fun!

851
01:16:09,155 --> 01:16:12,074
But l find the reference section
much more enlightening.

852
01:16:12,324 --> 01:16:13,700
For instance...

853
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:15,202
... if you look up...

854
01:16:15,452 --> 01:16:19,916
... professional football's
all-time bonehead plays...

855
01:16:20,458 --> 01:16:23,877
... you might read about a Miami Dolphin
kicker named Ray Finkle...

856
01:16:24,127 --> 01:16:28,757
... who missed a 26-yard field goal
in the closing seconds of Super Bowl 17.

857
01:16:31,635 --> 01:16:35,472
You wouldn't read that Finkle
was committed to a mental hospital...

858
01:16:35,723 --> 01:16:39,017
... only to escape and join the police...

859
01:16:39,267 --> 01:16:42,479
... in a scheme
to get even with Marino...

860
01:16:42,729 --> 01:16:44,856
... whom he blamed for the entire thing!

861
01:16:46,316 --> 01:16:48,068
What are you talking about?

862
01:16:48,276 --> 01:16:52,447
She's not Lois Einhorn!
She's Ray Finkle! She's a man!

863
01:16:52,656 --> 01:16:53,740
He's lying!

864
01:16:53,991 --> 01:16:55,283
Shoot him!

865
01:16:58,453 --> 01:17:01,538
Let's just see who's lying, shall we?

866
01:17:01,789 --> 01:17:05,794
Would a real woman have to wear
one of these?

867
01:17:11,799 --> 01:17:13,885
Boy, that's really on there!

868
01:17:14,427 --> 01:17:16,137
But tell me this:

869
01:17:16,346 --> 01:17:17,931
Would a real woman...

870
01:17:18,181 --> 01:17:20,391
... be missing these?

871
01:17:25,939 --> 01:17:28,733
That kind of surgery can be done
over the weekend.

872
01:17:29,275 --> 01:17:31,110
But l doubt very much...

873
01:17:31,653 --> 01:17:35,364
... if he could find the time
during his busy schedule...

874
01:17:35,614 --> 01:17:36,949
... to get rid of...

875
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:38,242
... big old...

876
01:17:38,451 --> 01:17:40,077
... Mr. Knish!

877
01:17:48,002 --> 01:17:49,421
Oh, boy!

878
01:17:52,590 --> 01:17:53,674
Come here.

879
01:17:54,510 --> 01:17:57,345
Would you excuse me for just one second?

880
01:18:05,728 --> 01:18:07,355
Ladies and gentlemen...

881
01:18:08,023 --> 01:18:10,858
... my esteemed colleague, Mr. Marino...

882
01:18:11,817 --> 01:18:13,820
... brought new evidence to my attention.

883
01:18:14,070 --> 01:18:15,070
Now...

884
01:18:15,445 --> 01:18:19,325
... history has certainly shown
that even the most intuitive...

885
01:18:19,575 --> 01:18:22,411
... criminal investigator can be wrong.

886
01:18:22,661 --> 01:18:24,705
But if l am mistaken...

887
01:18:25,039 --> 01:18:28,042
... if the lieutenant
is indeed a woman...

888
01:18:28,292 --> 01:18:30,586
... as she claims to be...

889
01:18:30,836 --> 01:18:32,004
... then, my friend...

890
01:18:32,254 --> 01:18:36,842
... she is suffering from the worst case
of hemorrhoids l have ever seen!

891
01:18:38,385 --> 01:18:40,679
That's why Roger Podacter is dead!

892
01:18:40,888 --> 01:18:43,349
He found Captain Winkie!

893
01:18:52,609 --> 01:18:53,692
Good night!

894
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:57,446
You've been a wonderful audience.
Be sure to tip your waitress.

895
01:19:02,409 --> 01:19:04,495
Die, animal boy!

896
01:19:05,286 --> 01:19:06,622
Quick decision.

897
01:19:27,435 --> 01:19:30,187
Loser!

898
01:19:37,236 --> 01:19:38,570
You have any more gum?

899
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:43,116
That's none of your damn business.
Stay out of my personal affairs.

900
01:19:43,909 --> 01:19:46,536
You're a weird guy, Ace. A weird guy.

901
01:19:48,079 --> 01:19:50,458
<i>Ladies and gentlemen... </i>

902
01:19:50,665 --> 01:19:52,500
<i>... the Miami Dolphins are proud... </i>

903
01:19:52,708 --> 01:19:55,545

906

<i>Snowflake!</i>

907
01:20:09,392 --> 01:20:11,019
<i>And now... </i>

908
01:20:11,227 --> 01:20:14,898
<i>... returning for the second half,
the Dolphins' most valuable player... </i>

909
01:20:15,565 --> 01:20:17,776
<i>... Dan Marino!</i>

910
01:21:03,779 --> 01:21:04,614
ldiot!

911
01:21:05,698 --> 01:21:10,620
Do you know what you've done?
You just cost me 25 grand, Polly.

912
01:21:10,828 --> 01:21:12,830
Yeah? Blow me!

913
01:21:14,540 --> 01:21:15,875
Really?

914
01:21:31,265 --> 01:21:32,849
<i>The National Football League... </i>

915
01:21:33,057 --> 01:21:37,813
<i>... would like to offer a special thank-
you to the man who rescued Dan Marino... </i>

916
01:21:38,022 --> 01:21:39,481
<i>... and our beloved Snowflake.</i>

917
01:21:40,065 --> 01:21:41,692
<i>A great humanitarian... </i>

918
01:21:41,942 --> 01:21:44,028
<i>... and a lover of all animals:</i>

919
01:21:44,403 --> 01:21:47,406
<i>Mr. Ace Ventura!</i>

920
01:21:49,409 --> 01:21:50,908
Get off me!

921
01:21:52,244 --> 01:21:53,871
Get off me!

922
01:21:58,125 --> 01:22:03,255
<i>Tone, put that big-ass size 13 on
and kick it for the homies.</i>
