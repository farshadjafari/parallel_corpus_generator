1
00:02:00,169 --> 00:02:03,798
Shit! Shit! Shit!

2
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:47,842
Hey! Stop, please!

3
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,821
In a related story,
the high court had also refused...

4
00:03:08,863 --> 00:03:13,326
to stay Friday's execution of former
philosophy professor David Gale.

5
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:16,662
- Oh, boy.
- Gale had sought a review of his 1994 conviction...

6
00:03:16,704 --> 00:03:21,042
for the rape and murder
of his University of Austin
colleague Constance Harraway.

7
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:25,671
The case has received
nation wide media attention
because Gale and Harraway...

8
00:03:25,713 --> 00:03:30,134
were activists for DeathWatch,
a nonprofit abolitionist organization.

9
00:03:30,217 --> 00:03:33,054
Do you understand how much money the
taxpayers pay in the state of Texas...

10
00:03:33,095 --> 00:03:35,139
to put one person to death?

11
00:03:35,222 --> 00:03:37,975
- What do we want?
- No more executions!

12
00:03:38,059 --> 00:03:39,977
Governor, can't we all just admit...

13
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:42,521
that the capital punishment system
in this country is not working?

14
00:03:42,563 --> 00:03:45,483
They're not gonna stay Gale.
It's on TV right now. Listen.

15
00:03:45,566 --> 00:03:47,902
Defense lawyers
had hoped to argue...

16
00:03:47,985 --> 00:03:51,030
that Gale's former activism
against capital punishment...

17
00:03:51,072 --> 00:03:53,532
unduly prejudiced
the Texas judicial system.

18
00:03:53,574 --> 00:03:56,911
The deal was, Bitsey
would get the interview
if the stay was refused.

19
00:03:56,994 --> 00:03:59,038
He'll talk to her
for two hours a day...

20
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,916
Tuesday, Wednesday
and Thursday.

21
00:04:01,999 --> 00:04:06,212
Can't do Friday, no.
'Cause Friday's the day
they execute him.

22
00:04:07,755 --> 00:04:10,591
- The lawyer said only Bitsey.
- Gale's going down.

23
00:04:10,675 --> 00:04:14,553
"Only Bitsey" means only Bitsey.

24
00:04:14,595 --> 00:04:17,598
I don't get to make
the rules, Joe. Please,
I'm a fat black woman.

25
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,394
- Tell him I said...
- What we need is to put her
on a plane to Texas.

26
00:04:21,477 --> 00:04:23,938
Why do you get like that around legal?
Hold on. We're coming over.

27
00:04:27,108 --> 00:04:29,610
So what's this "Only Bitsey
means only Bitsey" stuff?

28
00:04:29,652 --> 00:04:33,030
- They asked for you and no substitutes.
- Who's "they" exactly?

29
00:04:33,114 --> 00:04:37,702
Gale's lawyers.
More exactly, Gale's lawyer...
some good ol' boy in Austin.

30
00:04:37,785 --> 00:04:40,621
- Why do they want me?
- You're telling me you don't
want the assignment?

31
00:04:40,705 --> 00:04:45,751
No. I just can't see why a guy
on death row about to be
executed should ask for me.

32
00:04:45,793 --> 00:04:48,754
I think they like the kiddie
porn piece you did and going
to jail and stuff.

33
00:04:48,796 --> 00:04:51,424
I don't know.
Maybe he saw your picture
and thinks you're cute.

34
00:04:51,507 --> 00:04:54,885
- So how much access do I get?
- Three interviews. No time for any more.

35
00:04:54,969 --> 00:04:56,929
By Friday, the guy's a goner.

36
00:04:57,013 --> 00:05:01,517
- Okay. What exactly is our story?
- Rape, murder, death row.

37
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:04,437
Very intelligent guy.
Hey, maybe he's even innocent.

38
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:06,480
Yeah, right.

39
00:05:06,564 --> 00:05:09,734
No, no. Tell him
I'll call him back. Thanks.

40
00:05:09,817 --> 00:05:12,069
- Okay, so what's your problem?
- Hi, Barbara.

41
00:05:12,153 --> 00:05:14,655
Good morning, Bitsey.
Okay. Here's my concern.

42
00:05:14,739 --> 00:05:18,743
Setting aside the cost, although
half a million dollars...
in cash, I might add...

43
00:05:18,826 --> 00:05:21,787
for three days of interviews
is not only illegal, it's obscene.

44
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:24,582
That's market value.
The guy's never talked.

45
00:05:24,665 --> 00:05:28,544
Aside from that, I... we... are still
uncomfortable with the arrangement.

46
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:32,381
- Why?
- You just spent a very public seven days in jail...

47
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:34,592
for a very public
contempt of court citation.

48
00:05:34,675 --> 00:05:37,803
For protecting sources.
If you're so goddamn
uncomfortable with the story...

49
00:05:37,845 --> 00:05:41,140
why did you slap it
on both the domestic
and the international covers?

50
00:05:41,182 --> 00:05:45,478
Look, what makes me... us...
uncomfortable is the fact
that a rapist-slash-murderer...

51
00:05:45,561 --> 00:05:48,606
has asked to spend the last three days
of his life giving an interview...

52
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:53,319
his very first...
to a reporter who is now famous
for protecting sexual deviants...

53
00:05:53,361 --> 00:05:55,488
a reporter who's also
a very attractive woman.

54
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:58,991
Aw, come on!
This is disparate treatment.

55
00:05:59,075 --> 00:06:01,535
- Oh, boy.
- I could go if I were an ugly guy?

56
00:06:01,619 --> 00:06:04,705
There's an agenda issue here
which would be defused
with the presence of a man.

57
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:10,503
I hear lawyers gleefully
saying the words "Bloom vs.
NEWS Magazine, Incorporated. "

58
00:06:10,544 --> 00:06:14,131
Your Honor, I started to notice
my assignments being determined
on the basis of my sex.

59
00:06:14,215 --> 00:06:16,384
- No.
- You've gotta let her go now.

60
00:06:16,467 --> 00:06:19,011
- That's not quite what I meant.
- He's gotta let you go.

61
00:06:19,095 --> 00:06:23,349
All right, all right. Enough.
But the intern will be
with you at all times.

62
00:06:23,432 --> 00:06:27,520
- Okay.
- What? Intern?
No. You gotta be kidding.

63
00:06:27,603 --> 00:06:30,314
- That's what he said. He's the boss.
- He's a jerk.

64
00:06:30,398 --> 00:06:32,858
Come on. Not an intern.
I always work alone.

65
00:06:32,942 --> 00:06:35,319
- Not this time, Bitsey.
- Look, I'm not baby-sitting.

66
00:06:51,586 --> 00:06:55,256
Gale's D.N.A. Was everywhere.
His semen was inside her.

67
00:06:55,339 --> 00:06:57,258
He was seen leaving her house.

68
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,552
His prints were all over the kitchen,
including one on the bag.

69
00:06:59,594 --> 00:07:03,014
- Half a thumb print.
- Okay, half a thumb print.
That's enough.

70
00:07:03,097 --> 00:07:05,641
He could've touched it
before it was a murder weapon.

71
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:07,727
Do you fondle
your friends' garbage bags?

72
00:07:07,768 --> 00:07:11,897
I get very touchy
around household plastics.
I'm particularly fond of Tupperware.

73
00:07:11,981 --> 00:07:14,942
- Tupperware?
- Look, I'm just saying...

74
00:07:15,026 --> 00:07:17,570
the bag could've been sitting
up on the counter or something.

75
00:07:17,653 --> 00:07:20,740
Zack? He did it. Now he's gonna die.

76
00:07:20,781 --> 00:07:23,534
And you know something?
Maybe that's exactly what he deserves.

77
00:07:23,618 --> 00:07:27,538
But the murder's way too fuckin' clumsy.
This guy is a major intellectual.

78
00:07:27,622 --> 00:07:32,585
Top of his Harvard class,
Rhodes scholar, tenured at 27,
two books published.

79
00:07:32,668 --> 00:07:36,923
He's an academic stud.
Look at his wife,
a regular Grace Kelly...

80
00:07:36,964 --> 00:07:40,760
old money svelte,
father was ambassador to Spain.

81
00:07:40,843 --> 00:07:43,095
Shit. The light's on again.

82
00:07:43,179 --> 00:07:45,932
- Ignore it. It's a rental.
- Do you smell anything?

83
00:07:45,973 --> 00:07:48,267
No. Besides, the guy's
a flaming liberal.

84
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:50,311
A person's politics
has nothing to do...

85
00:07:50,394 --> 00:07:52,730
- with his propensity to commit a crime.
- Wrong.

86
00:07:52,813 --> 00:07:54,649
Aren't we supposed to smell
something if it's overheating?

87
00:07:54,732 --> 00:07:57,443
Seventy-three percent of
all serial killers vote Republican.

88
00:07:57,526 --> 00:08:00,446
Look, throw your cigarette out
so we can smell.

89
00:08:01,989 --> 00:08:04,325
No. You'll stink up the car.
Throw it out.

90
00:08:04,408 --> 00:08:06,911
- I'm not gonna fuckin' pollute.
- Zack!

91
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,803
There is definitely
something wrong with this car.

92
00:08:23,886 --> 00:08:25,763
Shit. This is so irritating.

93
00:08:25,846 --> 00:08:29,642
- How far to Huntsville?
- Look. I'm gonna pull off.

94
00:08:29,684 --> 00:08:32,979
NEWS Magazine reporters
Bitsey Bloom and Zack Stemmons...

95
00:08:33,062 --> 00:08:35,815
enter the rest area
with car troubles.

96
00:08:35,856 --> 00:08:38,067
Little did they know, it wasn't
just their car that was in trouble.

97
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:42,321
I'm a reporter. You're an intern.

98
00:08:44,782 --> 00:08:46,784
Whatever.

99
00:09:01,882 --> 00:09:05,761
- Is it hot?
- Ow! Jesus! Yes. Isn't it always?

100
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:12,018
- What do I do?
- Call the office and get
the rental road service number.

101
00:09:14,604 --> 00:09:18,858
- No signal. I gotta pee.
- Goddamn it.

102
00:09:36,334 --> 00:09:38,502
Zack?

103
00:09:38,586 --> 00:09:42,715
Zack?

104
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:47,887
- Zack!
- Yeah!

105
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,271
- Good morning.
- Hi.

106
00:10:40,064 --> 00:10:42,775
A little early for that, isn't it?

107
00:10:42,858 --> 00:10:47,446
- The nonsmoking section's over there.
- I meant the book.

108
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:51,325
Oh. Dialogical Exhaustion
by David Gale.

109
00:10:51,409 --> 00:10:54,954
- The guy's a genius.
- What time is it?

110
00:10:54,996 --> 00:10:58,791
9:15. There are, like,
10 prisons around here.

111
00:10:58,874 --> 00:11:03,629
Death row's in the Ellis unit,
but they're moving it to the
Terrell unit end of the year.

112
00:11:03,713 --> 00:11:07,925
The waitress's boyfriend works
there, but her last boyfriend
worked in the Huntsville unit.

113
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:12,221
The two before that in Walker.
The Estelle unit has the cutest guys.

114
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:16,350
And, I'm quoting, "My butt's too big
to get an Estelle guy."

115
00:11:18,436 --> 00:11:21,981
Ellis is 15 minutes out of town,
so we've got five and a half hours.

116
00:11:22,064 --> 00:11:25,026
Never eat in a place where the menus
have pictures of the food.

117
00:11:25,067 --> 00:11:28,154
Maybe we should drive into Austin
and check out the crime scene.

118
00:11:28,195 --> 00:11:30,781
That could be some great stuff
for our story, you know?

119
00:11:30,865 --> 00:11:34,660
This isn't "our story."
It's not even a story.
It's an interview.

120
00:11:34,744 --> 00:11:38,831
Most importantly for you to remember...
it's my interview.

121
00:11:38,873 --> 00:11:42,168
Okay. What do I do
for the next five hours?

122
00:11:42,209 --> 00:11:45,046
Drive around. Look for
a decent restaurant.

123
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:49,467
You know, Bitsey,
your reputation...

124
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,303
as "Mike Wallace with P.M.S"
doesn't do you justice.

125
00:11:52,386 --> 00:11:54,931
My reputation
got us invited here.

126
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:57,850
I play by the rules
even if my colleagues don't like it.

127
00:11:57,892 --> 00:12:00,811
- It's called... Objectivity.
- Ambition?

128
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,606
- So, what can I get you, ma'am?
- Coffee. Just coffee.

129
00:12:07,401 --> 00:12:11,530
Don't push me, smart-ass.

130
00:12:24,794 --> 00:12:28,798
You know you're in
the Bible Belt when there are
more churches than Starbucks.

131
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:31,217
When there are more prisons
than Starbucks.

132
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:34,804
He should die, die, die.

133
00:13:51,756 --> 00:13:54,467
He's ready to see y'all now.

134
00:13:54,508 --> 00:13:58,804
Yes, I am. I'm listenin'
very patiently.

135
00:13:58,846 --> 00:14:01,515
Ma'am, I'm not gonna
debate with you...

136
00:14:01,599 --> 00:14:03,809
the rights and wrongs
of this situation.

137
00:14:03,893 --> 00:14:07,521
Our job is to run
the state prison system.

138
00:14:07,605 --> 00:14:10,691
Well, ma'am, this is not France.
This is not Germany.

139
00:14:10,775 --> 00:14:14,195
This is Texas,
and we're gonna follow Texas law.

140
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:18,407
Well, you're very welcome, ma'am.
Good-bye now.

141
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:23,120
Thank you, Margie.
Correspondents Bloom
and Stevens, I presume.

142
00:14:23,204 --> 00:14:25,873
- Yes. Hello.
- Stemmons.

143
00:14:25,957 --> 00:14:28,459
Stemmons. Sorry.
Won't happen again.

144
00:14:28,542 --> 00:14:31,420
I'm Duke Grover, T.D.C.J.
Community relations.

145
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:34,507
He's usually
real good with names.

146
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:38,636
And these days, I always like to ask,
do you prefer Miss, Mrs. Or Ms.?

147
00:14:38,719 --> 00:14:41,597
- Bitsey.
- Bitsey it is.

148
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:44,350
- Margie, I'm stealin' your guests.
- Okeydokey.

149
00:14:44,392 --> 00:14:46,686
- Bitsey, you ever been in a prison?
- Yes.

150
00:14:46,727 --> 00:14:48,729
- On death row?
- No.

151
00:14:48,813 --> 00:14:52,191
I.D.'s again, please.
All executions in the state of Texas...

152
00:14:52,233 --> 00:14:54,360
occur over at
our Huntsville unit downtown...

153
00:14:54,402 --> 00:14:56,904
but death row is here
for the time being.

154
00:14:56,988 --> 00:15:00,825
This is home to all 442 offenders
prior to their date.

155
00:15:00,908 --> 00:15:03,369
Average stay on row
is nine years.

156
00:15:03,411 --> 00:15:06,080
Now, some get commuted,
but most get put to death.

157
00:15:06,163 --> 00:15:08,583
Earl. It'll put you off your supper,

158
00:15:08,624 --> 00:15:10,876
But, then, it's supposed to.

159
00:15:10,918 --> 00:15:13,129
Carla, New York guests
for Mr. Gale.

160
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:15,965
- Can I get your bags?
- We have three concerns here...

161
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,884
safety, safety and safety.

162
00:15:18,926 --> 00:15:22,888
Visitation area's entirely secure. We
just ask that you don't touch the glass.

163
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,599
- Windex gets expensive.
- Oh, hey.

164
00:15:24,682 --> 00:15:28,686
You're not carrying a weapon,
are you, Bitsey?

165
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:31,897
- Bitsey?
- Sorry. No.

166
00:15:31,939 --> 00:15:34,859
- Mr. Stemmons, you packin'?
- No, sir.

167
00:15:34,942 --> 00:15:36,736
- Cell phone?
- They're not working. No service.

168
00:15:36,777 --> 00:15:38,821
Then you won't mind
leaving them here.

169
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:42,158
We also have rules against the carryin'
of large sums of cash...

170
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:46,287
- Thank you.
- And the wearin' of open-toed shoes.

171
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:49,040
Those will do just fine.
You want to step on through now?

172
00:15:49,123 --> 00:15:51,083
There you go. Mm-hmm.

173
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:53,753
- Thank you, ma'am.
- That's fine.

174
00:15:55,004 --> 00:15:57,256
- Open-toed shoes?
- Drives 'em crazy.

175
00:15:57,298 --> 00:15:59,634
Your turn, Mr. Stemmons.
Right on through there.

176
00:15:59,717 --> 00:16:05,181
Good, good. Now, should
anything unpleasant occur
in the visitation area...

177
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,266
we ask you to stay put.

178
00:16:07,308 --> 00:16:10,394
And please, follow the instructions
of our fine correctional officers...

179
00:16:10,478 --> 00:16:12,438
should they see fit
to give you any.

180
00:16:12,521 --> 00:16:16,484
Bobby. Now, anything you say
can be overheard...

181
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:20,488
and any discussion of criminal
activity on your part is admissible.

182
00:16:20,571 --> 00:16:22,990
You're not plannin' on
a jailbreak now, are you, Bitsey?

183
00:16:23,074 --> 00:16:26,410
- Uh, no.
- Well, rain seems to be holdin' off.

184
00:16:26,494 --> 00:16:30,581
You watch your step here, Bitsey girl.
This cement can get pretty slippery.

185
00:16:30,665 --> 00:16:35,378
This is our Japanese garden.
Now, we ask you not
to throw coins in the pond.

186
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,091
Right this way.
Almost there.

187
00:16:41,676 --> 00:16:45,972
Here we are.
This is our visitation area right here.

188
00:16:46,013 --> 00:16:49,642
All yours, Mr. Belyeu.
Well, that's it for me.

189
00:16:49,725 --> 00:16:53,479
- You folks have a safe visit. Bye now.
- Thank you.

190
00:16:53,562 --> 00:16:57,525
- Ms. Bloom? Come right on in here
and make yourself comfortable.
- Yes.

191
00:16:57,566 --> 00:17:00,528
Did that P.R. Man
validate your parkin'?

192
00:17:00,569 --> 00:17:05,157
- He said the gift shop would do it.
- She's a smart one.

193
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:08,202
- Braxton Belyeu, Mr. Gale's attorney.
- This is Zack Stemmons.

194
00:17:08,286 --> 00:17:12,540
My good pleasure.
And right over here,
we have the man of the hour.

195
00:17:22,133 --> 00:17:24,510
- Hello.
- Hello.

196
00:17:24,594 --> 00:17:28,514
- Hi.
- Sit down,
Gale. Prisoner will not stand.

197
00:17:28,556 --> 00:17:31,058
Now, why can't they
turn that thing down?

198
00:17:31,142 --> 00:17:35,479
My lawyer respectfully requests
that you adjust the volume
on the speaker system.

199
00:17:35,563 --> 00:17:38,524
Gale. Sit down.

200
00:17:43,112 --> 00:17:47,742
They're practicing
being cruel and unusual.

201
00:17:47,825 --> 00:17:50,369
Well, Ms. Bloom, I'm sure
you're bitin' at the bit.

202
00:17:50,411 --> 00:17:53,748
It is our understanding that you
are to have three two-hour sessions...

203
00:17:53,831 --> 00:17:56,876
- today, tomorrow and Thursday.
- Mm-hmm.

204
00:17:56,918 --> 00:17:59,003
All at 3:00 in the p.m.

205
00:17:59,086 --> 00:18:01,255
I'm sorry we can't
afford you more time...

206
00:18:01,339 --> 00:18:04,008
but, contrary
to popular rumor...

207
00:18:04,091 --> 00:18:07,094
we have not yet begun to fight.

208
00:18:07,178 --> 00:18:09,680
It is our understanding
that you will do this alone.

209
00:18:09,764 --> 00:18:11,933
- The magazine would
prefer that I'm here.
- Alone. Understood.

210
00:18:12,016 --> 00:18:17,313
It's also our understanding
that you will use no recording
equipment of any kind.

211
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,523
- Correct.
- Excellent.

212
00:18:19,607 --> 00:18:22,109
Now, I have a few papers for which
I need your Jo Ann Hancock.

213
00:18:22,193 --> 00:18:26,405
So if you'd be kind enough
to stop by my Austin office
at your earliest convenience.

214
00:18:26,489 --> 00:18:29,575
Thursday mornin', say?
Expenses and so forth.

215
00:18:34,038 --> 00:18:38,876
Fine. Till Thursday then. Good luck,
Ms. Bloom. I'll stop by later.

216
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,090
Mr. Zack, what say you and me
partake of a death-defyin' cigarette...

217
00:18:44,131 --> 00:18:47,093
in the visitors' parking lot?
Bye-bye, y'all.

218
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:59,272
- So.
- Please pull up a seat.

219
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,242
- He's quite a character.
- Yes. He's about the only
outside contact I have now.

220
00:19:11,325 --> 00:19:14,954
- And a good friend.
- Where's your ex-wife?

221
00:19:14,996 --> 00:19:19,834
I don't want you to ask me
questions about her or my son.

222
00:19:19,917 --> 00:19:24,422
What I offer you is one thing,
but questions about them
are not part of our deal.

223
00:19:24,505 --> 00:19:28,050
Okay. Anything else,
just say "Off the record."

224
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:31,637
I'll take it to my grave.
You can trust me on that.

225
00:19:31,721 --> 00:19:35,182
Does this count
as recording equipment?

226
00:19:36,892 --> 00:19:41,480
- How do we start?
- We start with...

227
00:19:41,522 --> 00:19:45,318
you telling me
what I'm doing here.

228
00:19:45,401 --> 00:19:48,487
No one who looks through that glass
sees a person. They see a crime.

229
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:53,492
I'm not David Gale.
I'm a murderer and a rapist...

230
00:19:53,576 --> 00:19:55,995
four days shy of his execution.

231
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:01,792
You're here because
I wanna be remembered
as much for how I led my life...

232
00:20:01,876 --> 00:20:04,795
and the decisions that I made
as for how my life ended.

233
00:20:06,088 --> 00:20:09,008
- Why me?
- Why not?

234
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:12,511
- You spent some time
behind bars yourself recently.
- I certainly have.

235
00:20:12,553 --> 00:20:15,681
Because you do take things
to your grave.

236
00:20:15,765 --> 00:20:19,226
Protecting sources,
even kiddie porn scum,
is the magazine policy...

237
00:20:19,268 --> 00:20:21,270
and mine.

238
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:24,023
I know.
That's your reputation.

239
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:30,196
Well, I have a hard story
for you to tell, Ms. Bloom.

240
00:20:30,237 --> 00:20:32,239
It's not going to be easy.

241
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:35,993
So where do we begin?

242
00:20:38,788 --> 00:20:41,332
Well, I suppose I should
tell you how I became
the head of philosophy...

243
00:20:41,415 --> 00:20:44,377
at the University of Austin.

244
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,592
Come on. Think.

245
00:20:51,676 --> 00:20:55,346
I want you to reach back into
those minds and tell me, tell us all...

246
00:20:55,429 --> 00:21:00,059
What is it that
you fantasize about?

247
00:21:00,101 --> 00:21:02,895
World peace?
I thought so.

248
00:21:02,937 --> 00:21:06,524
Do you fantasize about
international fame?

249
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:12,571
Do you fantasize about
winning a Pulitzer Prize?

250
00:21:12,655 --> 00:21:15,116
Or a Nobel Peace Prize?

251
00:21:15,199 --> 00:21:18,369
An MTV Music Award?

252
00:21:18,452 --> 00:21:23,916
Do you fantasize about meeting
some genius hunk, ostensibly bad...

253
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,377
but secretly simmering
with noble passion...

254
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,797
and willing to sleep
on the wet spot?

255
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,800
- I'll take two! I'll take two!
- What was that?

256
00:21:32,842 --> 00:21:34,844
Kimberly will take two.

257
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:39,765
You get Lacan's point.
Fantasies have to be unrealistic...

258
00:21:39,849 --> 00:21:43,477
because the moment... the second...
that you get what you seek...

259
00:21:43,561 --> 00:21:45,563
you don't...
you can't want it anymore.

260
00:21:45,646 --> 00:21:48,441
In order to continue to exist...

261
00:21:48,482 --> 00:21:52,945
desire must have its objects
perpetually absent.

262
00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:57,158
It's not the "it" that you want.
It's the fantasy of"it."

263
00:21:57,241 --> 00:22:02,163
So, desire supports crazy fantasies.

264
00:22:02,246 --> 00:22:03,956
Sorry.

265
00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:13,799
This is what Pascal means when he says
that we are only truly happy...

266
00:22:13,883 --> 00:22:16,135
when daydreaming
about future happiness.

267
00:22:16,218 --> 00:22:18,721
- It came today.
- Or why we say...

268
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:20,932
the hunt is sweeter
than the kill.

269
00:22:21,015 --> 00:22:24,518
Or be careful what you wish for,
not because you'll get it...

270
00:22:24,602 --> 00:22:28,814
but because you're doomed
not to want it once you do.

271
00:22:28,856 --> 00:22:32,652
So the lesson of Lacan is,
living by your wants
will never make you happy.

272
00:22:32,735 --> 00:22:37,782
What it means to be fully human is
to strive to live by ideas and ideals...

273
00:22:37,865 --> 00:22:42,995
and not to measure your life
by what you've attained
in terms of your desires...

274
00:22:43,037 --> 00:22:47,375
but those small moments
of integrity, compassion...

275
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:51,128
rationality, even self-sacrifice.

276
00:22:51,212 --> 00:22:56,509
Because in the end, the only way
that we can measure the
significance of our own lives...

277
00:22:56,592 --> 00:22:59,053
is by valuing the lives of others.

278
00:23:03,516 --> 00:23:05,476
All right.
I'll see you all on Monday.

279
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:31,252
Sorry about being late.

280
00:23:31,335 --> 00:23:33,379
There was, you know, a thing.

281
00:23:34,672 --> 00:23:36,716
Yeah, there usually is, Berlin.

282
00:23:38,092 --> 00:23:40,344
Look, I know that
I'm not doin' too well.

283
00:23:41,637 --> 00:23:45,141
And to torture a cliché...

284
00:23:46,934 --> 00:23:49,061
I would do anything to pass.

285
00:23:54,734 --> 00:24:00,323
- Anything, huh?
- Any... thing.

286
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:05,036
Okay, Berlin.

287
00:24:08,122 --> 00:24:10,124
I will give you a good grade...

288
00:24:10,207 --> 00:24:14,378
I will give you
a very, very good grade...

289
00:24:14,462 --> 00:24:18,883
if you would just...

290
00:24:20,635 --> 00:24:22,595
study.

291
00:24:30,686 --> 00:24:32,688
- Hey.
- Hey.

292
00:24:32,772 --> 00:24:36,275
The T.A. Finished transcribing
all the governor's radio and TV
comments. Listen to this gem.

293
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:41,530
Journalist: Governor, don't
you think three executions
in one week is excessive?

294
00:24:41,614 --> 00:24:45,785
Governor: 'I say,
bring'em in, strap'em down
and let's rock and roll."'

295
00:24:45,826 --> 00:24:48,913
It's good to hear that
our governor's in touch
with his inner frat boy.

296
00:24:48,996 --> 00:24:51,165
Tell me again why you're
not doing this debate.

297
00:24:51,249 --> 00:24:54,085
- Telegenics. You have a cuter butt.
- Oh, I hadn't noticed.

298
00:24:54,168 --> 00:24:57,004
- I know.
- No. I didn't mean that.

299
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,589
I've highlighted stuff.

300
00:25:05,346 --> 00:25:07,682
He'll do the whole
"down home wisdom" thing...

301
00:25:07,765 --> 00:25:10,559
capital punishment is God's law,
an eye for an eye.

302
00:25:10,643 --> 00:25:14,897
Stick to arguments about rational facts.
And watch your ego.

303
00:25:14,981 --> 00:25:17,066
Don't come across as one of those
"I hate authority...

304
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:21,570
'cause everyone around here
wears big hats and nobody
in charge reads The New Yorker."

305
00:25:21,654 --> 00:25:24,532
- Anything else?
- I'm getting new federal stats
from Amnesty tonight.

306
00:25:24,615 --> 00:25:26,826
Well, bring them by Greer's party.

307
00:25:26,909 --> 00:25:29,120
I have papers to grade.

308
00:25:29,203 --> 00:25:32,331
- And if you have
a hangover tomorrow...
- I'm walkin' away.

309
00:25:32,415 --> 00:25:36,210
- 10:00! Bright-eyed
and bushy-tailed.
- Bushy-tailed.

310
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:52,393
Hey, Jamie. Did you
mark your calendar yet?

311
00:25:52,476 --> 00:25:54,478
Yep, I sure did.

312
00:25:54,562 --> 00:25:58,858
One, two, three, four more days
until Mom comes home.

313
00:25:58,899 --> 00:26:02,903
Only four more days?
That's great news.

314
00:26:02,987 --> 00:26:06,324
Can I ask you something?
It's really, really important.

315
00:26:06,407 --> 00:26:09,869
- Of course you can.
- Can we have pancakes for breakfast?

316
00:26:09,952 --> 00:26:12,038
Okay.

317
00:26:12,121 --> 00:26:16,584
- With syrup and strawberries?
- Well, we'll have to see.

318
00:26:16,626 --> 00:26:22,048
- And chocolate shavers?
- No, no. It's chocolate shavings.

319
00:26:22,089 --> 00:26:24,884
- And whipped cream?
- Whipped cream?

320
00:26:24,967 --> 00:26:27,845
That's a lot of requests
for one little boy.

321
00:26:27,929 --> 00:26:31,223
- Why don't you go to sleep?
- Do Cloud Dog too.

322
00:26:31,307 --> 00:26:33,559
Okay. Good night,
Cloud Dog.

323
00:26:33,601 --> 00:26:36,228
There you go.
You go to sleep.

324
00:26:37,605 --> 00:26:41,943
Good night.
Don't forget to feed the fish.

325
00:26:42,026 --> 00:26:45,237
- What?
- Don't forget to feed the fish.

326
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,782
Okay.

327
00:26:49,784 --> 00:26:53,871
Jo Edna, I'll be back before midnight.
Here's the phone number to reach me.

328
00:26:53,955 --> 00:26:56,040
There's chicken and stuff in
the refrigerator if you want some.

329
00:26:56,123 --> 00:27:00,044
That's fine, Mr. Gale. Maybe I'll
fix myself something later. Bye.

330
00:27:00,127 --> 00:27:02,171
Bye.

331
00:27:07,969 --> 00:27:12,932
- Dad, did you feed the fish?
- Yes, I did. Now go to sleep.

I'm still asleep.
Someone wake me up.

339
00:27:38,082 --> 00:27:41,419
- Professor Gale.
Where's your better half?
- John, how are you?

340
00:27:41,502 --> 00:27:44,755
Better half? Oh, my wife.
Um, she's in Spain.

John, have you seen Alma?
She's been looking for you.

343
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,305
So my wife's affair is
just this big open secret.

344
00:27:52,388 --> 00:27:54,640
Uh, hermeneutical bias.

345
00:27:54,724 --> 00:27:57,310
The only fun truths are
the ones someone's trying to hide.

346
00:27:57,351 --> 00:28:01,063
She's been to Barcelona four
times this year. I don't think
she's trying to hide anything.

347
00:28:01,147 --> 00:28:03,232
Well, her father
is the ambassador.

348
00:28:03,316 --> 00:28:06,152
Yeah, except the embassy's
in Madrid.

349
00:28:06,193 --> 00:28:08,446
Ah. Oh, by the way,
Berlin's here...

350
00:28:08,529 --> 00:28:10,698
and, uh, pretty livid.

351
00:28:10,781 --> 00:28:12,783
- Why?
- We've expelled her.

352
00:28:12,867 --> 00:28:16,078
She got the letter today and
took the opportunity to throw
a little fit in my office.

353
00:28:16,162 --> 00:28:19,999
- Talkin' about me?
- Why, yes, as a matter of fact,
we were.

354
00:28:20,041 --> 00:28:22,043
Did he tell you that I said,
when you were circumcised...

355
00:28:22,126 --> 00:28:24,629
they threw away the wrong part?

356
00:28:24,712 --> 00:28:27,882
Yes. I believe he mentioned it.
It's called schmuck.

357
00:28:27,965 --> 00:28:30,927
- What?
- The part of the foreskin
they throw away...

358
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,179
after circumcision,
I think it's called schmuck.

359
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:36,015
- Aren't we so fucking clever?
- I think perhaps I shall get another.

360
00:28:36,057 --> 00:28:38,059
- David?
- Black Bush.

361
00:28:38,142 --> 00:28:40,937
You were a jerk this afternoon.

362
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,856
Well, for what it's worth,
I didn't know about
the expulsion till just now.

363
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,983
Is that supposed to be an apology?

364
00:28:46,067 --> 00:28:50,905
No. It's more like a... conciliation.

- Who took a young man up to her room...

377
00:29:52,049 --> 00:29:53,968
where they argued all night
as to who had the right...

378
00:29:54,051 --> 00:29:57,263

and to whom.

00:30:37,011 --> 00:30:40,556
Okay. I'm finished. I'm done.

383
00:30:43,517 --> 00:30:45,561
I'm not a student anymore.

384
00:30:47,021 --> 00:30:49,815
I do not think
I wanna know what that means.

385
00:30:51,108 --> 00:30:54,487
There once was a girl
named Berlin...

386
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:57,240
who liked a bit
now and again.

387
00:30:57,323 --> 00:31:01,118
Not now and again,
but now...

388
00:31:01,202 --> 00:31:03,246
And again...

389
00:31:03,329 --> 00:31:05,414
and again.

390
00:31:05,498 --> 00:31:09,335
- Cute, huh?
- Oh, yeah. Very cute.

391
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:13,172
I have a secret...

392
00:31:13,256 --> 00:31:15,258
but I have to come
over there to tell you.

393
00:31:15,341 --> 00:31:17,843
Oh, no, no, no, no.
No. You s...

394
00:31:17,927 --> 00:31:19,720

- No. No.

395
00:31:19,804 --> 00:31:22,014
- I come.
- You stay back.

396
00:31:22,056 --> 00:31:24,350
Woman, you should...

397
00:31:24,433 --> 00:31:27,061
You should...
You should stay...

398
00:31:27,144 --> 00:31:29,814
I wasn't after the grade.

399
00:31:34,151 --> 00:31:36,988
- Look, I don't think this is... is such a...
- Shh.

400
00:31:39,282 --> 00:31:42,660
Now, we can talk, analyze...

401
00:31:42,743 --> 00:31:44,704
contemplate.

402
00:31:44,787 --> 00:31:47,248

Don't reject me.

Please.

405
00:32:15,026 --> 00:32:17,069
- Rip them.
- What?

406
00:32:17,153 --> 00:32:19,614

00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,287
Harder.

412
00:33:09,372 --> 00:33:12,583
Bite my shoulder.

413
00:33:23,761 --> 00:33:28,349
- Aw.!

414
00:33:28,432 --> 00:33:30,434
- Thanks for comin'
- More.! More.!

415
00:33:32,687 --> 00:33:36,649
- All right, you guys,
it's time to go home.

416
00:33:36,691 --> 00:33:40,486
- Get outta here.

417
00:33:46,075 --> 00:33:48,661
It's not gonna work.
That's a faulty argument.

418
00:33:48,703 --> 00:33:51,330
Let's say we found
an innocent on death row.
What would change?

419
00:33:51,414 --> 00:33:54,000
After the retrial, the governor
would simply go on TV...

420
00:33:54,041 --> 00:33:58,045
and say, "See? Thanks to the good people
at DeathWatch, the system works."

421
00:33:58,129 --> 00:34:00,756
Sure, if we had absolute proof
that he had executed an innocent...

422
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:04,010
we could demand a moratorium,
like in Illinois.

423
00:34:04,093 --> 00:34:06,637
- Are you okay?
- Sorry. Yeah.

424
00:34:06,721 --> 00:34:09,432
But that won't happen.
The dead men can't make a case...

425
00:34:09,515 --> 00:34:12,059
- and almost-martyrs don't count.
- Got it.

426
00:34:12,143 --> 00:34:15,354
- So, keep it rational. And stop that.
- Mm-hmm.

427
00:34:15,438 --> 00:34:18,399
- What?
- Active listening.
I hate active listeners.

428
00:34:18,482 --> 00:34:21,736
I feel like they're too busy
pretending to listen to
actually hear what I'm saying.

429
00:34:21,819 --> 00:34:24,238
I can listen and actively listen
at the same time.

430
00:34:24,322 --> 00:34:26,657
- I'm good at that.
- Did you bring the Amnesty stats?

431
00:34:26,741 --> 00:34:29,535
Yes. No. Oh!
I left them at home.

432
00:34:31,787 --> 00:34:33,789
I have a copy.

433
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:42,381
- You want to tell me what's up?
- Nothing.

434
00:34:42,465 --> 00:34:44,467
Everything.

435
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:50,306
Something profoundly
stupid happened last night.

436
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:54,060
I hope you used a condom.

437
00:34:55,061 --> 00:34:58,522
Oh. Jesus Christ, David.

438
00:35:00,358 --> 00:35:04,528
- Was she one of yours?
- It was Berlin.

439
00:35:04,612 --> 00:35:09,408
Oh, great!

440
00:35:09,492 --> 00:35:12,787
Oh, that's great.
I can hear the grapevine now.

441
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:16,249
"They had to suspend her so that Gale
could dick her with a clear conscience."

442
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:18,459
A power differential equals coercion.
That is great.

443
00:35:18,542 --> 00:35:21,462
- You're so weak.
- You're not my wife, Constance.
Thank God.

444
00:35:21,545 --> 00:35:24,548
Well, don't worry.
It's not a position
I aspire to, so fuck you.

445
00:35:24,632 --> 00:35:28,302
- I didn't mean it that way.
Are you okay?
- Let's go. Yes!

446
00:35:28,386 --> 00:35:30,763
- Really?
- Yes. Let's go.

447
00:35:32,515 --> 00:35:35,601
There are
17,000 murders a year
in the United States.

448
00:35:35,685 --> 00:35:38,104
Ten of the 12 states
that have abolished
the death penalty...

449
00:35:38,187 --> 00:35:40,773
they have a murder rate that's
lower than the national average.

450
00:35:40,815 --> 00:35:43,651
And if he starts with
the religious stuff, just say that...

451
00:35:43,734 --> 00:35:47,905
nearly every denomination
in the United States
opposes the death penalty.

452
00:35:47,989 --> 00:35:49,949
- Are you listening? Okay.
- Yes.

453
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:05,464
- All right.
Ten seconds, everybody.
- Roll tape, please.

454
00:36:05,548 --> 00:36:07,633
Count 'em in, Mack.

455
00:36:09,677 --> 00:36:12,680
Here we go.
Five, four...

456
00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:20,187
Welcome back to Batter's Box.
We continue our very special
four-part program...

457
00:36:20,271 --> 00:36:23,441
with Governor Hardin, and
arguing capital punishment with him...

458
00:36:23,524 --> 00:36:27,153
is DeathWatch regional codirector,
Professor David Gale.

459
00:36:27,236 --> 00:36:30,656
- You are up, Governor.
- You know, Alan,
I always say the same thing...

460
00:36:30,698 --> 00:36:33,117
and I'm gonna keep on sayin' it...
I hate killin'...

461
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,328
and my administration
will kill to stop it.

462
00:36:35,411 --> 00:36:40,541
- How about it?
- Murderers are not deterred
by the thought of execution.

463
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:42,627
They're just not,
and you know it.

464
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:45,129
Every single study that's
been done on this subject...
and there's been over 200...

465
00:36:45,212 --> 00:36:48,257
and you've read them...
has reached the same conclusion.
They all say the same thing.

466
00:36:48,341 --> 00:36:50,301
Well, maybe you should
read your Bible.

467
00:36:50,384 --> 00:36:54,138
Deuteronomy 19:21.
An eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.

468
00:36:54,221 --> 00:36:56,557
What did Gandhi say about that?

469
00:36:56,641 --> 00:37:00,561
"The old law of an eye for an eye
leaves us all blind."

470
00:37:00,645 --> 00:37:03,356
Well, I'm sorry...
and with respect...
that's fuzzy liberal thinking.

471
00:37:03,439 --> 00:37:05,900
- You really believe that, Governor?
- Of course.

472
00:37:05,983 --> 00:37:09,153
That's interesting. 'Cause you
said that yourself in a speech
in your first campaign.

473
00:37:09,237 --> 00:37:12,573
He got... He got you there,
Governor. How about it?

474
00:37:12,657 --> 00:37:15,493
Yes, he did.
Yes, he did.

475
00:37:15,576 --> 00:37:17,411
If you're not a liberal at 30,
you've got no heart.

476
00:37:17,495 --> 00:37:19,747
And if you're still a liberal at 40,
you've got no brain.

477
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:22,208
- That's Winston Churchill.
- Touché.

478
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:24,835
So what you're essentially
saying and what you feel is...

479
00:37:24,919 --> 00:37:27,672
and this is to choose another quote...
"that a healthy society...

480
00:37:27,755 --> 00:37:32,051
must stop at nothing
to cleanse itself of evil."

481
00:37:33,386 --> 00:37:36,514
Uh, yes. Uh...
I'd have to agree.

482
00:37:36,597 --> 00:37:39,600
- Did I say that too?
- Oh, no, sir. That was Hitler.

483
00:37:39,684 --> 00:37:42,061
Ooh.

484
00:37:42,103 --> 00:37:44,230
Oh!

485
00:37:44,313 --> 00:37:48,568
Can't we just admit that
the capital punishment system
in this country is not working?

486
00:37:48,651 --> 00:37:52,905
We are condemning people to death
based on phony expert testimony...

487
00:37:52,989 --> 00:37:55,575
on junk science,
on-on jail house snitches...

488
00:37:55,658 --> 00:38:00,288
Alan, did you know that Texas
has the highest per capita
incarceration rate in the world?

489
00:38:00,371 --> 00:38:03,374
- Forty-three people
that you executed...
- Alan, could I...

490
00:38:03,457 --> 00:38:08,045
were represented by lawyers who were
at one time disbarred or sanctioned.

491
00:38:08,129 --> 00:38:10,339
There are two men on death row
right now, on this day...

492
00:38:10,423 --> 00:38:14,760
- whose lawyers fell asleep
during cross-examination.
- I'm not a lawyer.

493
00:38:14,802 --> 00:38:17,096
And the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
ruled that that was not...

494
00:38:17,179 --> 00:38:19,473
that was not a basis for a retrial.

495
00:38:19,557 --> 00:38:22,393
Governor, that's just a flawed,
insane, crazy system.

496
00:38:22,476 --> 00:38:25,146
And a flawed system
will kill innocent men.

497
00:38:25,229 --> 00:38:28,357
Okay, all right.
Let him answer.

498
00:38:28,441 --> 00:38:31,068
All right, Mr. Gale,
we'll play your game. Name one.

499
00:38:31,152 --> 00:38:34,739
Name one innocent man that Texas
has put to death during my tenure...

500
00:38:34,822 --> 00:38:37,074
of the hundred or so executions...

501
00:38:37,158 --> 00:38:39,452
It's 131, Governor,
in case you lost count.

502
00:38:39,493 --> 00:38:42,121
- Let him finish.
- Fine. Thank you. Whatever.

503
00:38:42,204 --> 00:38:45,458
Just give me a name...
I'm gonna write it down...

504
00:38:45,499 --> 00:38:48,002
a man that you can prove
was innocent...

505
00:38:48,085 --> 00:38:50,463
- There you go.

506
00:38:50,504 --> 00:38:52,506
And I'll call a moratorium.

507
00:38:53,883 --> 00:38:56,427
Mr. Gale.

508
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,765
- Are we through here, Alan?
- You know what?
We're running out of time.

509
00:39:00,848 --> 00:39:04,769
I'd like to thank my guests,
Governor Hardin and Professor
David Gale from DeathWatch.

510
00:39:04,852 --> 00:39:08,648
- Roll credits.
- Thank you for joining me today.
Hope you will join me tomorrow.

511
00:39:11,233 --> 00:39:13,236
Your exact words were...

512
00:39:13,319 --> 00:39:15,279
"Just tell me when my ego's
getting in the way of the work. "

513
00:39:15,363 --> 00:39:17,615
I'm telling you, your ego's
getting in the way of the work.

514
00:39:17,698 --> 00:39:19,659
I didn't wanna do this
in the first place.

515
00:39:19,742 --> 00:39:23,329
You put up two seconds of
protest at the thought of
being on a televised debate.

516
00:39:23,371 --> 00:39:25,498
- What does that mean?
- It means that DeathWatch
suffers because...

517
00:39:25,581 --> 00:39:28,709
you're so anxious to finger authority,
to publicly prove that David Gale...

518
00:39:28,793 --> 00:39:31,295
is so much fucking smarter
than the powers that be!

519
00:39:31,379 --> 00:39:35,132
Learn to work without
an audience. Try squeezing
money from the donor list.

520
00:39:35,216 --> 00:39:37,176
Have you licked one single
mail-out envelope?

521
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:40,179
- Mr. Gale?
- Hey, guys, the governor went that way.

522
00:39:40,221 --> 00:39:42,473
Ramirez... Austin Police.
This is Officer Hasermann.

523
00:39:42,556 --> 00:39:44,558
What, is debating the governor
a crime now?

524
00:39:44,642 --> 00:39:48,396
No, sir. Rape is.

525
00:39:53,985 --> 00:39:57,196
- Berlin had my bite marks.
- Gale! Time's up.

526
00:39:59,323 --> 00:40:03,995
Bruises. Her clothes were ripped.
My skin was found under her fingernails.

527
00:40:04,078 --> 00:40:06,914
I mean, it didn't look like anything
but rape. Then she drops the charges...

528
00:40:06,998 --> 00:40:09,166
and leaves town, making
it look like I was guilty...

529
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:11,877
and she was too traumatized
to face a trial.

530
00:40:11,961 --> 00:40:14,880
My wife had to read
all about this while she was
sitting in the airport...

531
00:40:14,922 --> 00:40:17,758
wondering where I was,
why I wasn't there to pick her up.

532
00:40:17,842 --> 00:40:20,052
It took me almost two weeks
to get bailed out.

533
00:40:20,094 --> 00:40:22,096
- And the grad student Berlin?

534
00:40:22,179 --> 00:40:25,349
Why do you think
she did it?

535
00:40:25,433 --> 00:40:29,353
Poke her finger at authority,
show the powers that be
how much smarter she was.

536
00:40:29,437 --> 00:40:32,106
Grad student's revenge.
I don't really know.

537
00:40:32,189 --> 00:40:34,191
- Do you know where I can find her?
- No.

538
00:40:34,275 --> 00:40:37,361
First year I was in here,
I got a postcard from San Francisco.

539
00:40:37,445 --> 00:40:41,365
It was signed, "From the student
who would do anything. "

540
00:40:41,449 --> 00:40:43,910
Did she say anything else?

541
00:40:43,951 --> 00:40:46,537
"I'm sorrier than you can know."

542
00:40:46,621 --> 00:40:48,915
- Move it, Gale.
- I'm running out of time.

543
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:58,591
Can you imagine his wife letting
him stew in jail for two weeks?

544
00:40:58,633 --> 00:41:03,512
Who can blame her? We'll get
an address for the Berlin girl
from the university.

545
00:41:03,596 --> 00:41:05,556
You still don't think
he's telling the truth.

546
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,059
- On the Berlin rap?
- On the whole rap.

547
00:41:08,142 --> 00:41:11,479
Who knows? Anyway,
there is no truth, only perspectives.

548
00:41:11,562 --> 00:41:15,191
If you say there's no truth,
you're claiming
it's true there's no truth.

549
00:41:15,274 --> 00:41:19,362
- It's a logical contradiction.
- Working on our Philosophy
Merit Badge, are we?

550
00:41:19,445 --> 00:41:22,114
When it comes to rape,
an accusation's as good
as a conviction.

551
00:41:22,198 --> 00:41:25,159
- It sticks like shit.
- That's an appetizing metaphor.

552
00:41:25,243 --> 00:41:28,246
Technically, a simile.
I think he's telling the truth.

553
00:41:28,329 --> 00:41:30,414
This you know from sitting
in a prison lobby?

554
00:41:30,498 --> 00:41:34,752
- It's just my perspective.
- Three different courts
found him guilty, Zack.

555
00:41:34,835 --> 00:41:37,296
That's enough perspective for me.

556
00:42:07,368 --> 00:42:10,204
Okay, okay, okay.

557
00:42:10,288 --> 00:42:12,665
1-33-0-what?

558
00:42:12,707 --> 00:42:14,917
Seven.

559
00:42:15,001 --> 00:42:18,462
Thirty-three... oh-three.

560
00:42:18,546 --> 00:42:21,632
3305. 3307.
Right there.

561
00:42:27,221 --> 00:42:29,307
Geez. Look at the sign.

562
00:42:40,735 --> 00:42:44,363
♪ The stranger in your life ♪
Hi.

563
00:42:44,405 --> 00:42:47,199
- I'm Bitsey Bloom.
This is Zack Stemmons.

564
00:42:47,283 --> 00:42:49,702
- We're... Uh, yeah.
- You want the tour?

565
00:42:49,744 --> 00:42:52,872
There's a $20 mandatory
donation... apiece.

566
00:42:52,955 --> 00:42:56,083
But you get
a reenactment photo pack,
and it's got five pictures.

567
00:42:56,167 --> 00:42:59,003
- Okay.
- I gotta collect first.

568
00:42:59,086 --> 00:43:02,089
Oh, sure. I got it.

569
00:43:05,635 --> 00:43:09,096
Go sign the book.
It doesn't have to be
your real name though.

570
00:43:09,138 --> 00:43:12,058
The first page just says
you're here to do research
on violent crime.

571
00:43:12,099 --> 00:43:14,226
The state requires it
for nonprofit shit.

572
00:43:15,686 --> 00:43:18,439
Take a reenactment
photo pack.

573
00:43:18,522 --> 00:43:20,483
Uh, if you guys could share one,
it'd be really cool...

574
00:43:20,566 --> 00:43:22,902
'cause the fuckers that
do my prints jerk my chain.

575
00:43:22,985 --> 00:43:26,030
That's me.
My boyfriend took it.

576
00:43:26,113 --> 00:43:29,575
We also got a video.
It's 50 bucks 'cause you
can see my tits.

577
00:43:29,659 --> 00:43:32,703
There's a version
without tits. It's 35.

578
00:43:32,787 --> 00:43:37,416
- Do many people take the tour?
- Not so much anymore.

579
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:40,628
We thought this'd be, like,
a busy week with Gale getting
the prune juice and all.

580
00:43:40,711 --> 00:43:43,256
So you... you don't mind
living here?

581
00:43:43,339 --> 00:43:46,467
It's better than livin'
with my dick-wad parents.

582
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:50,096
It starts over here.
She let him crash here sometimes.

583
00:43:50,137 --> 00:43:52,765
He was, like,
constantly wasted.

584
00:43:52,807 --> 00:43:55,935
Exhibit one.
He drank scotch religiously.

585
00:43:56,018 --> 00:43:58,646
- The rest is in the kitchen.

586
00:44:00,731 --> 00:44:04,735
Here's number two.
This is where the tripod was.

587
00:44:04,819 --> 00:44:07,780
My boyfriend borrowed the one
we usually show to folks.

588
00:44:07,863 --> 00:44:11,659
They never found a camera
or photos or video or anything.

589
00:44:11,742 --> 00:44:13,828
Gale must have buried them.

590
00:44:13,911 --> 00:44:17,915
These serial killer dudes
take photos to whack off to later.

591
00:44:17,999 --> 00:44:21,627
He-He's not exactly
a serial killer.

592
00:44:21,711 --> 00:44:24,505
Whatever.

593
00:44:24,589 --> 00:44:27,091
She was, like,
totally naked right here.

594
00:44:27,174 --> 00:44:29,802
The meter man saw her
through the door.

595
00:44:29,844 --> 00:44:32,638
Gale handcuffed her,
taped her mouth...

596
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,807
and then taped a bag over
her head so she couldn't breathe.

597
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:37,852
He used those housewife gloves
so he wouldn't leave prints.

598
00:44:37,935 --> 00:44:40,187
They found sticky stuff
from the tape on them.

599
00:44:40,271 --> 00:44:44,442
- Uh! We ask folks
not to touch the exhibit.
- Right.

600
00:44:44,525 --> 00:44:47,653
Totally sick part
is where they found
the key to the handcuffs.

601
00:44:47,695 --> 00:44:52,283
- Yeah. We know.
- Wait. What? Where was it?

602
00:44:52,366 --> 00:44:58,164
It was in her stomach, dude.
Gale made her swallow it
before he bagged her.

603
00:44:58,205 --> 00:45:00,833
That's pretty much
the highlights.

604
00:45:02,043 --> 00:45:04,045
Got questions?

605
00:45:11,469 --> 00:45:13,471
I can still smell
the cigarette smoke.

606
00:45:13,554 --> 00:45:17,683
It's the barbecue.

607
00:45:17,725 --> 00:45:22,647
Can you imagine?
The key was in her stomach.

608
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:26,150
That's so fucking cold, man.

609
00:45:28,569 --> 00:45:30,571
- Zack?
- What?

610
00:45:30,613 --> 00:45:33,491
Isn't that the cowboy
from the rest area?

611
00:45:36,577 --> 00:45:39,914
- The same truck.
- Weird coincidence, huh?

612
00:45:39,997 --> 00:45:42,291
Well, coincidences
are always weird.

613
00:45:42,375 --> 00:45:45,336
That's why
they are coincidences.

614
00:45:49,423 --> 00:45:51,217
Off the record.

615
00:45:52,134 --> 00:45:55,179
Okay. We're off.

616
00:45:55,263 --> 00:45:57,265
Constance
was murdered...

617
00:45:57,348 --> 00:46:00,601
by what's known as
the Securitat method.

618
00:46:00,685 --> 00:46:03,187
You're handcuffed,
forced to swallow the key.

619
00:46:03,271 --> 00:46:05,606
is sealed around your head...

620
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:07,692
and you're left there
to suffocate.

621
00:46:07,775 --> 00:46:10,736
The Securitat did it to Romanians
when they wouldn't inform or confess.

622
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:14,073
Sometimes the bag was ripped off
your head at the last moment
to give you a second chance.

623
00:46:14,156 --> 00:46:18,160
Otherwise, you died knowing
that the key to your freedom...

624
00:46:18,244 --> 00:46:20,788
was inside of you
the entire time.

625
00:46:20,871 --> 00:46:23,082
It's a cheap
but effective method.

626
00:46:23,165 --> 00:46:25,293
The problem is...

627
00:46:27,503 --> 00:46:31,007
I once mentioned it
in an article that I wrote.

628
00:46:32,967 --> 00:46:34,969
Prosecution never knew that.

629
00:46:36,971 --> 00:46:41,559
- Someone's framing you?
- Oh, it's more than that.

630
00:46:41,642 --> 00:46:44,478
- There was a tripod.
- Right.

631
00:46:45,855 --> 00:46:48,316
Facing her body.
We back on the record?

632
00:46:48,399 --> 00:46:53,112
Yes. The tripod
had no fingerprints on it.

633
00:46:53,195 --> 00:46:55,239
That means that
somebody brought it there...

634
00:46:55,323 --> 00:46:59,327
set it up,
wiped it clean and left it.

635
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:04,415
Why? It's as if they wanted me
to know that somewhere out there...

636
00:47:04,498 --> 00:47:07,460
is a record of exactly
what happened that afternoon...

637
00:47:07,501 --> 00:47:11,339
as if they wanted me to die knowing
that the key to my freedom...

638
00:47:11,422 --> 00:47:13,424
is out there somewhere.

639
00:47:15,009 --> 00:47:17,011
Maybe you're being paranoid.

640
00:47:17,094 --> 00:47:21,098
Miss Bloom, I used to be the state's
leading death penalty abolitionist...

641
00:47:21,182 --> 00:47:23,267
and now I'm on death row.

642
00:47:23,351 --> 00:47:26,562
Doesn't that strike you
as a little odd?

643
00:47:26,646 --> 00:47:29,607
Any idea who "they" are?

644
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:33,319
No, but I've got someone
working on that...

645
00:47:33,402 --> 00:47:35,696
someone I'm relying on
to prove my innocence.

646
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:37,865
Belyeu's hired a detective?

647
00:47:39,325 --> 00:47:41,494
A journalist.

648
00:47:41,535 --> 00:47:43,537
She has to help me.

649
00:47:47,625 --> 00:47:50,211
- You know I'm innocent.
- No.

650
00:47:54,131 --> 00:47:57,843
- No, I don't.

651
00:48:04,225 --> 00:48:06,894
Wear me like a fur, Daddy.
Wear me like a fur.

652
00:48:06,978 --> 00:48:11,190
Okay. Who's your hero?
Who's your... Ow! Ow!
You go get Cloud Dog.

653
00:48:11,274 --> 00:48:13,609
Hey! Cloud Dog!

654
00:48:15,778 --> 00:48:19,323
Call me when you land.

655
00:48:19,407 --> 00:48:22,660
- Has any couple ever survived
a trial separation?
- Don't.

656
00:48:22,743 --> 00:48:25,037
Isn't separating contrary
to the whole idea of trying
to work things out?

657
00:48:25,121 --> 00:48:26,914
- Don't.
- Boo!

658
00:48:26,998 --> 00:48:29,542
Jamie, get in, sweetie.

659
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:34,380
- See ya later, alligator.
- After a while, crocodile.

660
00:48:34,463 --> 00:48:38,884
- Take it easy, "Japaneesee."
- Okeydokey, "artichokee."

661
00:48:38,926 --> 00:48:40,928
Scoot.

662
00:48:42,763 --> 00:48:45,391
- Listen...
- I sent you an E-mail.

663
00:48:46,601 --> 00:48:51,147
- An E-mail.
- Just read it.

664
00:48:54,191 --> 00:48:56,193
Jamie.

665
00:49:01,908 --> 00:49:04,368
- Come on, sweetie.

666
00:49:41,197 --> 00:49:43,950
Just read it.

667
00:49:54,961 --> 00:49:58,297
You could at least hide the bottle.

668
00:50:10,017 --> 00:50:11,686
Well?

669
00:50:13,104 --> 00:50:15,106
Officially, you're on sabbatical.

670
00:50:17,275 --> 00:50:19,443
Unofficially,
they want you out of here.

671
00:50:19,527 --> 00:50:22,113
It was 4-2.

672
00:50:23,114 --> 00:50:25,700
How did Ross vote?

673
00:50:25,783 --> 00:50:28,494
I'm not supposed to dis...

674
00:50:30,371 --> 00:50:32,456
Against you.

675
00:50:41,132 --> 00:50:43,301
And you?

676
00:50:44,885 --> 00:50:46,846
For you...

677
00:50:48,389 --> 00:50:50,349
and against my politics.

678
00:51:23,132 --> 00:51:25,259
- Yes. Mada...

679
00:51:25,343 --> 00:51:29,221
- No. M... Please, please.

680
00:51:29,305 --> 00:51:32,391
Madam. Atenc...
،Atenciَn.! Attenzione.!

681
00:51:32,475 --> 00:51:35,561
Uh, I am...
My name is David Gale.

682
00:51:35,645 --> 00:51:39,690
I have phoned before.
Yes? Yes?

683
00:51:39,774 --> 00:51:41,776
- Can...

684
00:51:41,817 --> 00:51:45,029
No. Uh... Por favor.

685
00:51:48,783 --> 00:51:52,578
What? No, never mind.
Can you please get Sharon Gale?

686
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:56,082
- Ah.! Seٌora Gale.
- Ah! Yes. Miss Gale. Yes.

687
00:52:05,174 --> 00:52:09,720
- Hello? Hello?

688
00:52:24,652 --> 00:52:27,780
So I... I wanted to hear
your feedback on the idea.

689
00:52:27,863 --> 00:52:32,285
Look, Professor Gale, I could sit here...
as I'm sure others have...

690
00:52:32,326 --> 00:52:37,123
and plead departmental cutbacks,
claim you need more publications...

691
00:52:37,164 --> 00:52:40,585
I need a minority... whatever.

692
00:52:40,668 --> 00:52:43,796
All bull geschichte.

693
00:52:43,838 --> 00:52:48,259
Your record's brilliant.
You're an original voice,
worth in today's...

694
00:52:48,342 --> 00:52:51,512
"scarcity defines value capitalist
system under which we toil..."

695
00:52:51,596 --> 00:52:53,472
your weight in gold.

696
00:52:53,556 --> 00:52:57,143
Hell, it's... It's not even
your alcohol problem.

697
00:52:57,184 --> 00:53:01,939
It'd be nice to have a faculty member
whose crutch wasn't Prozac.

698
00:53:02,023 --> 00:53:05,693
But to speak plain,
if I were to hire you...

699
00:53:05,776 --> 00:53:11,073
in the eyes of the regents,
the alumni and every freshman
with an ear for gossip...

700
00:53:11,157 --> 00:53:13,117
I'd be hiring a rapist.

701
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:17,830
- Those charges were dropped.
- People would say
you had a good lawyer.

702
00:53:17,914 --> 00:53:22,168
- I was innocent.
- You don't get it, do you?

703
00:53:22,251 --> 00:53:24,795
You're not politically correct,
Dr. Gale.

704
00:53:24,879 --> 00:53:27,840
Welcome to the club.

705
00:53:30,593 --> 00:53:34,221
- Socrates is... is sentenced to death.

706
00:53:34,305 --> 00:53:38,351
Socrates is sentenced to death.
I bet you didn't know that.
He was sentenced to death.

707
00:53:38,434 --> 00:53:42,313
But Athenian law... Athenian law
let the condemned...

708
00:53:42,396 --> 00:53:45,566
- come up with their own
alternate punishment.

709
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:49,946
Isn't that a great idea?
So where are the Athenians
when you really need 'em?

710
00:53:51,739 --> 00:53:54,617
So anyway, Socrates...
And he was ugly.

711
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:57,745
- Did I mention that? Did I
mention that Socrates was ugly?

712
00:53:57,828 --> 00:54:00,915
He was ugly.
Socrates was ugly, Plato was fat...

713
00:54:00,998 --> 00:54:05,086
and, uh, and Aristotle
was a prissy dresser.

714
00:54:05,169 --> 00:54:08,881
So anyway, Socrates
comes up with this idea.

715
00:54:08,923 --> 00:54:13,261
He says... He says, "Well, what if
I pay a fine instead of death?"

716
00:54:13,344 --> 00:54:17,014
He suggests a fine.
All he has to do in order to live...

717
00:54:17,098 --> 00:54:21,060
is to come up with
an appropriately punitive figure.

718
00:54:21,143 --> 00:54:23,145
Punitive figure.

719
00:54:23,229 --> 00:54:26,399
Guess what he suggested?
Thirty bucks.

720
00:54:27,733 --> 00:54:31,904
Thirty bucks?
Does that make any sense?

721
00:54:31,988 --> 00:54:35,408
Thirty bucks. That's 30 mina.
That was the currency
of the day... a mina.

722
00:54:35,491 --> 00:54:38,077
Well, it's minae.
Minae. That's the plural.

723
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,162
Minae.

724
00:54:40,246 --> 00:54:44,709
Thirty bucks!
Thirty pieces of silver.

725
00:54:44,792 --> 00:54:48,588
And the judges are so pissed that
more of them voted to kill him...

726
00:54:48,629 --> 00:54:50,631
than had voted him guilty
in the first place.

727
00:54:50,715 --> 00:54:53,634
That just doesn't make any sense.

728
00:54:53,718 --> 00:54:55,970
Thirty pieces of silver.

729
00:54:56,053 --> 00:54:59,807
Just like the Judas guy,
the Jesus kisser...

730
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:01,809
who was also a prissy dresser.

731
00:55:44,685 --> 00:55:48,272
Without a successful completion
of an alcohol-treatment program...

732
00:55:48,356 --> 00:55:50,650
you can forget visitation.

733
00:55:50,733 --> 00:55:53,152
You'll be lucky
to get a Christmas card.

734
00:55:53,194 --> 00:55:55,196
That's if there even is
a custody hearing.

735
00:55:57,531 --> 00:56:01,535
- What does that mean?
- If your wife convinces
a Spanish court...

736
00:56:01,619 --> 00:56:05,873
that you're a danger to the child,
then you'll never see him again.

737
00:56:05,957 --> 00:56:08,918
He just has to come home.
He's gotta come back.

738
00:56:09,001 --> 00:56:11,045
Hey, Pete, can we have
another round here.

739
00:56:13,339 --> 00:56:15,800
I'm fine.

740
00:56:19,428 --> 00:56:22,556
- I just have to go get him then.
- Europe's not Mexico, David.

741
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,227
They got real borders over there.
You might be able to get yourself
in easy enough...

742
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:28,896
but getting out
with a six-year-old...

743
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:32,233
That's a whole different
kettle of crawdads.

744
00:56:32,316 --> 00:56:36,028
Then you get your life together.

745
00:56:36,112 --> 00:56:39,490
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Pronto.

746
00:56:48,708 --> 00:56:51,502
Who wants to start?

747
00:57:00,052 --> 00:57:03,973
Hi. My name is David, and...

748
00:57:04,056 --> 00:57:06,017
I am an alcoholic.

749
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:08,060
Hi, David.

750
00:57:13,941 --> 00:57:17,528
So, Mr. Gale...

751
00:57:17,612 --> 00:57:20,239
tell me three
personal qualities...

752
00:57:20,323 --> 00:57:22,450
that you feel you have...

753
00:57:22,533 --> 00:57:24,911
that would make you
a successful Radio Shed manager.

754
00:57:26,871 --> 00:57:29,916
- Three.
- Three.

755
00:57:32,043 --> 00:57:35,922
Okay. Well...

756
00:58:14,835 --> 00:58:16,837
No, I'm sorry.

757
00:58:16,921 --> 00:58:18,923
I'm...

758
00:58:19,006 --> 00:58:20,967
Oh, I'm sorry.

759
00:58:21,050 --> 00:58:22,969
- Welcome back.
- Thanks.

760
00:58:23,052 --> 00:58:26,097
- You look good.
- I feel good.

761
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:30,476
Look, there's somethin'
that you gotta see.

762
00:58:30,518 --> 00:58:32,770
Betty Sue Johnson's
been rescheduled.

763
00:58:32,853 --> 00:58:34,814
Her execution date
is set for the eighth.

764
00:58:34,897 --> 00:58:36,899
I have a conference call
with Washington tonight.

765
00:58:36,983 --> 00:58:38,943
If the new national director
will commit to emergency funds...

766
00:58:39,026 --> 00:58:41,404
So Betty Sue gets commuted,
and you only prove the system works.

767
00:58:41,487 --> 00:58:43,447
But I'll save a life.

768
00:58:43,531 --> 00:58:45,533
Hey, where'd you
get that bruise?

769
00:58:45,616 --> 00:58:48,119
Oh, just... doin' chores.

770
00:58:48,202 --> 00:58:51,747
- Is your cowboy gettin' rough with you?
- Ha ha.

771
00:58:54,041 --> 00:58:57,336
Oh, there he is.
Hey, Dusty...

772
00:58:57,420 --> 00:59:00,339
does she ever invite you overand not put you to work?

773
00:59:00,423 --> 00:59:03,384
Hey, David.

774
00:59:03,467 --> 00:59:05,511
All right.
Tell me her story.

775
00:59:05,595 --> 00:59:08,973
She was sentenced at 17.
I really wanna get behind this one.

776
00:59:09,056 --> 00:59:11,893
- She's so articulate.
- Who did she kill?

777
00:59:11,976 --> 00:59:16,314
- She'll put a face on the death penalty.
- Constance, who did she kill?

778
00:59:16,355 --> 00:59:19,984
- A cop.
- Oh, you're crazy.

779
00:59:20,067 --> 00:59:23,195
Not just your medium-range
"thinks she's Roosevelt's bathrobe,"

780
00:59:23,279 --> 00:59:27,450
but I mean stark-raving, screws-loose,
in-the-belfry insane.

781
00:59:27,533 --> 00:59:31,913
Seventeen... four years before
she could legally drink a beer.

782
00:59:31,996 --> 00:59:34,040
But she killed a cop, Constance.

783
00:59:34,123 --> 00:59:37,293
- Are you gonna help?
- Of course.

784
00:59:37,376 --> 00:59:39,462
Oh. You're burnin' up.

785
00:59:48,846 --> 00:59:51,849
Jo Edna.

786
00:59:51,933 --> 00:59:55,394
- Hi, Mr. Gale.
- How are you, Jo Edna?
It's good to see...

787
01:00:07,782 --> 01:00:10,076
- Caffeine jolt. We deliver.
- Howdy, David.

788
01:00:10,159 --> 01:00:13,663
- Howdy, folks.
- Oh, my, this is service.

789
01:00:13,746 --> 01:00:16,290
- Thank you.
- Gladly. Latte on the left
there for you, Josh.

790
01:00:16,374 --> 01:00:18,376
- Mocha.
- Ooh, thanks.

791
01:00:18,417 --> 01:00:23,256
- She's on the phone to Washington.
- The new national director.

792
01:00:23,339 --> 01:00:26,217
- Uh-huh. That's right.

793
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:28,886
I'm sure we can get some pulpit time.
Maybe some cable.

794
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:31,472
Cable's good.
Listen, I need to run.

795
01:00:31,555 --> 01:00:34,934
For now, I agree the first
press release should focus
on the woman's youth.

796
01:00:35,017 --> 01:00:37,645
I'll have the Washington people
look into counsel competency...

797
01:00:37,728 --> 01:00:39,730
though I'm almost sure
she's exhausted this on appeal.

798
01:00:39,814 --> 01:00:42,400
- Let's see what
kind of resources these...
- Uh... John, David's gonna go...

799
01:00:42,483 --> 01:00:46,070
Oh, I almost forgot.
Gale's not around, is he?

800
01:00:46,153 --> 01:00:49,282
- No.
- Good. Keep it that way.

801
01:00:49,365 --> 01:00:51,284
His relationship
with DeathWatch is over.

802
01:00:51,367 --> 01:00:54,328
- Last thing we need is
this rape thing coming back...
- John.

803
01:00:54,412 --> 01:00:57,373
To bite us on the butt,
and these guys don't stay
on the wagon for very long.

804
01:00:57,456 --> 01:01:00,710
- John.
- I'm serious, Constance.
Ban him from the premises.

805
01:01:00,793 --> 01:01:02,587
I realize the two of you both...

806
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:11,846
- David!

807
01:01:27,361 --> 01:01:31,699
Sharon, pick up the phone.
I'm begging you.!

808
01:01:31,782 --> 01:01:35,870
He's my son, all right?
He's my son too,
and I wanna talk to him.

809
01:01:35,953 --> 01:01:38,414
- You've not let... Hello?

810
01:01:38,497 --> 01:01:43,794
Jamie? Jamie, is that you?
Hey. Hey, little moose.
How are you?

811
01:01:43,836 --> 01:01:46,505
I miss you so much.
It's Daddy.

812
01:01:46,589 --> 01:01:50,384
Yeah. Hello. Don't...
Jamie, wait.

813
01:01:50,468 --> 01:01:53,054
- Wait, wait. Don't hang up the phone.

814
01:01:53,137 --> 01:01:55,723
Goddamn it! Damn!

815
01:01:55,806 --> 01:01:58,351
God... damn it!

816
01:02:04,065 --> 01:02:06,317
Ow! Fuck!

817
01:02:54,282 --> 01:02:57,660
- Oh, you scared me.

818
01:02:57,743 --> 01:03:02,039
My sheep needs a manager...
a manger.

819
01:03:02,123 --> 01:03:04,292
My sheep needs a manger.

820
01:03:05,293 --> 01:03:07,378
Are you okay?

821
01:03:08,921 --> 01:03:13,009
I fell off the wagon
and I hurt myself.

822
01:03:13,092 --> 01:03:15,177
Come on.
Come on inside.

823
01:03:20,975 --> 01:03:24,937
Do you know why Saint Jude
is the patron saint of lost causes?

824
01:03:24,979 --> 01:03:27,899
'Cause his real name was Judas.

825
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:31,068
Judas. There were
two Judases...

826
01:03:31,152 --> 01:03:35,406
Judas, who was the saint guy,
and then the other one...

827
01:03:35,489 --> 01:03:37,742
Judas, who was the bad one.

828
01:03:37,783 --> 01:03:41,746
He's the one that ratted out Jesus
and tried to kiss him.

829
01:03:41,787 --> 01:03:44,415
In medieval times, they would
never pray to the good Judas...

830
01:03:44,498 --> 01:03:47,877
for fear of getting the bad Judas
on the line just by mistake.

831
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:53,883
Ergo, they never really gave him
business unless absolutely desperate.

832
01:03:53,966 --> 01:03:57,803
That's why... And then they
changed his name.

833
01:03:57,887 --> 01:04:01,140
Your mail is blowing.

834
01:04:02,141 --> 01:04:04,143
Constance.

835
01:04:09,357 --> 01:04:11,317
Hey! Hey!

836
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:13,486
Hey! Oh, shit!

837
01:04:19,242 --> 01:04:21,661
- Are you the doctor? What's wrong with her?
- Yes.

838
01:04:21,744 --> 01:04:23,704
- She's gonna be fine.
- How do you know? You haven't looked at her.

839
01:04:23,788 --> 01:04:26,791
- Just calm down.
- She just collapsed. She was opening her mail and just fell.

840
01:04:26,874 --> 01:04:28,876
- Please have a seat in the waiting room.
- I don't know what's wrong.

841
01:04:28,918 --> 01:04:31,254
- Please. Is there a doctor...
- She's gonna be fine.

842
01:04:31,337 --> 01:04:33,256
- Wait here. Professor!
- I have to go with her.

843
01:04:33,339 --> 01:04:36,008
You wanna get arrested again?

844
01:04:38,928 --> 01:04:41,681
- How do you know who I am?
- I watch the news.

845
01:04:41,764 --> 01:04:44,100
Now go wait.

846
01:05:16,924 --> 01:05:18,926
Ah!

847
01:05:18,968 --> 01:05:20,970
- How are we doing?
- Fine. How's Constance?

848
01:05:21,053 --> 01:05:25,892
Sleeping. Mr. Gale, a
leukemia patient's condition...

849
01:05:25,975 --> 01:05:29,270
- is highly susceptible to external stress.
- What? What?

850
01:05:29,353 --> 01:05:33,316
Constance's illness requires
a degree of regularity.

851
01:05:36,611 --> 01:05:39,155
Constance has leukemia?

852
01:05:40,239 --> 01:05:43,784
You didn't know?

853
01:05:43,868 --> 01:05:46,162
Wait. Wait.

854
01:05:50,041 --> 01:05:52,960
No, I didn't.

855
01:06:00,593 --> 01:06:02,929
It's funny how selfish
we can be, isn't it?

856
01:06:06,098 --> 01:06:09,518
When I first heard Constance
was dying, I was so mad at her.

857
01:06:12,021 --> 01:06:14,106
I thought, "How can you do this to me?

858
01:06:14,190 --> 01:06:17,360
You know how hard it is for
me to need other people."

859
01:06:20,029 --> 01:06:22,365
Why hadn't she told you?

860
01:06:23,699 --> 01:06:25,701
She said she was too busy.

861
01:06:28,496 --> 01:06:30,581
I guess, since death was chasing her...

862
01:06:30,665 --> 01:06:33,542
she just wanted to help
other people avoid it.

863
01:06:35,169 --> 01:06:40,132
That's what she did with her life.

864
01:06:42,635 --> 01:06:45,554
Constance...

865
01:06:45,596 --> 01:06:48,599
left this world a better
place than she found it.

866
01:06:50,893 --> 01:06:55,231
It's a small... but difficult thing.

867
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:25,511
- Good shot! Good shot!

868
01:07:36,022 --> 01:07:38,524
- Geez.
- Let's go.

869
01:07:38,608 --> 01:07:41,944
- So, what'd you get?
- I talked to the Austin prosecutor.

870
01:07:41,986 --> 01:07:44,780
Belyeu's a joke. Actually,
the exact phrase he used was...

871
01:07:44,864 --> 01:07:46,866
"Big hat, no cattle."

872
01:07:46,949 --> 01:07:50,411
- He was sanctioned twice. Fucked up the penalty phase.
- What?

873
01:07:50,494 --> 01:07:53,331
Gale could've got life
on mitigating factors.

874
01:07:53,414 --> 01:07:57,126
And despite major pro bono offers from
some of the top lawyers in the country...

875
01:07:57,209 --> 01:07:59,211
Gale stuck with him all
through the appeals process...

876
01:07:59,295 --> 01:08:02,131
which, by the way, Belyeu
continued to screw up.

877
01:08:02,173 --> 01:08:05,217
So Belyeu's a joke.

878
01:08:05,301 --> 01:08:07,970
Great.

879
01:08:08,054 --> 01:08:10,097
- Anything else?
- Nothing on Berlin.

880
01:08:10,181 --> 01:08:12,350
Oh, we pick up the payola
money in Houston tonight.

881
01:08:12,433 --> 01:08:15,603
- Houston?
- That's what the head office said.

882
01:08:15,645 --> 01:08:19,190
- Overheat light came on twice. Um...
- Come on.

883
01:08:41,671 --> 01:08:45,675
- Ah!

884
01:08:45,758 --> 01:08:48,803
Oh, man! I never knew a million
bucks could weigh so much.

885
01:08:48,886 --> 01:08:51,514
- Half a million.
- Well, it's still heavy.

886
01:08:51,556 --> 01:08:53,558
But a million sounds
better for our st...

887
01:08:53,641 --> 01:08:56,352
Excuse me. Your story. A million bucks.

888
01:08:56,435 --> 01:08:58,646
No, no. Wait. A million bucks in cash.

889
01:08:58,688 --> 01:09:01,941
Just relax, Zack. It's only money.

890
01:09:09,156 --> 01:09:11,200
So, you comin' in?

891
01:09:12,952 --> 01:09:16,747
- Excuse me?
- You wanna come in?

892
01:09:18,374 --> 01:09:21,460
- Please.
- I thought you were into guys with money.

893
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:29,176
- Zack? It's open.
- What?

894
01:09:29,218 --> 01:09:32,013
- Well, maybe the maid forgot.

895
01:09:34,682 --> 01:09:37,768
- Look.

896
01:09:42,398 --> 01:09:44,483
Well... We gotta call somebody.

897
01:09:48,446 --> 01:09:50,489
Wait.

898
01:10:01,751 --> 01:10:04,170
- What is that?
- I don't know.

899
01:10:20,353 --> 01:10:22,897
This is not good.

900
01:10:36,786 --> 01:10:39,080
- I'm gonna check the bathroom.
- No, no. Bitsey, no.

901
01:10:39,121 --> 01:10:41,123
You wait there.

902
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:22,999
- Bitsey!
- What? Zack, There could've been prints.

903
01:11:23,082 --> 01:11:25,084
Look.

904
01:11:43,144 --> 01:11:46,188
The lady at reception says that no one asked
for you. All the room keys are different.

905
01:11:46,272 --> 01:11:48,649
- Just she and her husband have masters.
- What'd you tell her?

906
01:11:48,691 --> 01:11:52,153
- That you have a jealous boyfriend.
- Thanks. How about the V.C.R.?

907
01:11:52,236 --> 01:11:55,573
She didn't ask. I think she assumed it had
something to do with why he was jealous.

908
01:11:55,656 --> 01:11:57,992
- You sure we shouldn't call the cops?
- No.

909
01:11:58,034 --> 01:12:00,536
Anyway, whoever got in here
without a key in broad daylight...

910
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:02,622
was probably smart enough
not to leave prints.

911
01:12:02,705 --> 01:12:05,499
I have the remote. Here.

912
01:12:05,541 --> 01:12:08,336
- Are you sure you wanna see what's on here?
- No.

913
01:12:10,046 --> 01:12:12,089
- Try three.
- Three.

914
01:12:12,173 --> 01:12:14,967
I hope this isn't what I think it is.

915
01:12:22,225 --> 01:12:24,477
Oh, my God.

916
01:12:26,062 --> 01:12:29,523
- Is it her?
- Yeah, it's her.

917
01:12:39,075 --> 01:12:41,911
- Oh, man.

918
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:45,665
Geez.

919
01:13:20,950 --> 01:13:23,953
Belyeu said to bring the
tape first thing tomorrow.

920
01:13:25,788 --> 01:13:28,666
He also said you were right
about not calling the police.

921
01:13:34,755 --> 01:13:36,757
You gonna be all right?

922
01:13:39,719 --> 01:13:41,846
No.

923
01:14:02,116 --> 01:14:05,369
He deserves it though, probably. There's
a lot of sick people in this world.

924
01:14:05,453 --> 01:14:07,455
And if they done wrong
and they're found guilty...

925
01:14:07,496 --> 01:14:09,999
All right. Let's just say
Gale's telling the truth.

926
01:14:10,041 --> 01:14:13,210
Maybe some right-wing fuck set him
up, arranged the perfect murder.

927
01:14:13,294 --> 01:14:17,006
Why would you send a magazine journalist
proof a few hours before you've won?

928
01:14:17,048 --> 01:14:21,052
- It does not make sense.
- No. It's perfect.

929
01:14:21,135 --> 01:14:24,472
Whoever this is knows how hard
it is to get a retrial in Texas.

930
01:14:24,513 --> 01:14:28,476
They know the magazine can't give this
any substantial play before the execution.

931
01:14:28,517 --> 01:14:32,271
We'd have to give it to a daily
or a network. That won't happen.

932
01:14:32,355 --> 01:14:36,943
- But mostly, they know I'll tell Gale today.
- So?

933
01:14:38,903 --> 01:14:42,365
What if Constance's murder was
just a means of getting at Gale...

934
01:14:42,406 --> 01:14:45,576
not only to get rid of him, but
to make abolishionists look crazy?

935
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:47,870
Of course he sympathizes
with murderers. He is one.

936
01:14:47,954 --> 01:14:50,998
They make sure he sits
six years on death row...

937
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,751
for a brutal rape and murder,
then they let him die...

938
01:14:53,834 --> 01:14:56,587
die knowing everyone will
remember him with disgust.

939
01:14:56,671 --> 01:14:58,965
They destroy his life,
his work, his memory...

940
01:14:59,048 --> 01:15:03,594
- and they make him watch.
- That's a lot of hate.

941
01:15:05,471 --> 01:15:09,600
- Well, then why release it?
- Hate's no fun if you keep it to yourself.

942
01:15:27,243 --> 01:15:29,662
Whoa. We got company.

943
01:15:29,745 --> 01:15:32,206
- The cowboy?
- Mm-hmm.

944
01:15:32,248 --> 01:15:35,001
And doing a lousy job of hiding.

945
01:15:36,002 --> 01:15:38,504
Oh, he must think we're idiots.

946
01:15:38,588 --> 01:15:41,215
- Is he gaining?
- No. He's just sitting back there.

947
01:15:41,257 --> 01:15:43,884
Get a license plate number.

948
01:15:46,095 --> 01:15:50,016
- Ohh. He's turned off.
- God, I'm sorry.

949
01:15:50,099 --> 01:15:52,768
What does this guy want?

950
01:15:56,606 --> 01:16:00,026
Fine. And, uh, Bobbi, could you make
a quick copy of that videotape...

951
01:16:00,109 --> 01:16:02,528
and bring in Miss Bloom's
original when that's done?

952
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:07,533
- I don't blame you for not watching that twice.
- I couldn't sleep afterwards.

953
01:16:07,617 --> 01:16:11,412
I understand. I tell folks I'm no
more afraid of the Grim Reaper...

954
01:16:11,454 --> 01:16:14,582
than I am of a Presbyterian
on Mother's Day, but, uh...

955
01:16:14,624 --> 01:16:16,709
watching that tape, well, uh...

956
01:16:16,792 --> 01:16:20,713
I had to keep telling myself that's
not Constance just to get through.

957
01:16:20,796 --> 01:16:23,299
Unfortunately, others
may argue the same.

958
01:16:23,382 --> 01:16:27,220
But it's in her kitchen, in her house.

959
01:16:27,303 --> 01:16:30,473
Currently home to
Weirdos, Incorporated.

960
01:16:30,514 --> 01:16:35,436
Arguably, that tape could have been made by
anybody with $20 and a tolerance for vulgarity.

961
01:16:35,478 --> 01:16:38,272
- Will it get us a postponement?
- Us?

962
01:16:38,314 --> 01:16:42,318
This ain't my first rodeo, Miss Bloom.

963
01:16:42,401 --> 01:16:45,655
Now, I got to tell you that
there's a machine a-runnin'

964
01:16:45,738 --> 01:16:49,200
And come tomorrow night at 6:00,
that machine gonna wanna be fed.

965
01:16:49,283 --> 01:16:52,036
- All here, Mr. Belyeu.
- Thank you, Aaron.

966
01:16:52,119 --> 01:16:56,540
Now, to add to our troubles, your own
credibility may come into question.

967
01:16:56,624 --> 01:16:59,877
- Why?
- Well, you've been fraternizing with the condemned.

968
01:16:59,961 --> 01:17:04,423
- I've been what?
- He's the most likely candidate to have put you onto that tape.

969
01:17:04,507 --> 01:17:08,719
He's a persuasive man, you an out-of-state
woman. That don't look so good.

970
01:17:08,803 --> 01:17:12,139
Mr. Belyeu, someone
put the tape in my room.

971
01:17:12,181 --> 01:17:14,183
That's a fact for which
we have no evidence.

972
01:17:14,267 --> 01:17:17,603
- Thank you, Bobbi.
- Thanks.

973
01:17:17,687 --> 01:17:21,857
Let's not throw a pity party
and sit around reading Kafka.

974
01:17:21,941 --> 01:17:24,569
Could be we find a sympathetic judge.

975
01:17:24,652 --> 01:17:27,863
- I'll file within the hour. You goin' over to see Gale?
- Yeah.

976
01:17:27,947 --> 01:17:31,409
Fine. I'll give you a call over
to the motel later with an update.

977
01:17:46,048 --> 01:17:48,551
My coat. Shoot.

978
01:18:07,236 --> 01:18:10,156
- What? Who?
- Did you see him? The cowboy.

979
01:18:10,239 --> 01:18:11,866
- He was here?
- He's in the lobby.

980
01:18:11,908 --> 01:18:14,952
Go see if his truck's out front.
Tail him, get a license number.

981
01:18:15,036 --> 01:18:17,663
Find out who he is. Don't
screw this up. It's important.

982
01:18:17,747 --> 01:18:20,249
- How are you gonna get to the prison?
- Taxi.

983
01:19:04,210 --> 01:19:06,754
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

984
01:19:10,466 --> 01:19:13,636
I don't think you're being straight
with me. I walk out of Belyeu's office...

985
01:19:13,719 --> 01:19:15,888
- the guy's in the lobby.
- Maybe you should just calm down.

986
01:19:15,972 --> 01:19:18,182
Visitor, please stay seated.

987
01:19:19,976 --> 01:19:21,936
Maybe you should sit down.

988
01:19:28,192 --> 01:19:32,863
His name is Dusty Wright. He's the local
DeathWatch director before Constance.

989
01:19:32,947 --> 01:19:35,116
He's a bullhorner.

990
01:19:35,157 --> 01:19:40,997
He's a zealot who thinks that a good
demonstration has to end with riots and arrests.

991
01:19:41,038 --> 01:19:43,708
DeathWatch fired him because
he punched somebody at a rally.

992
01:19:43,791 --> 01:19:47,336
But Constance kept him in the
organization. He adored her.

993
01:19:47,420 --> 01:19:51,007
They were close. Real close.

994
01:19:52,133 --> 01:19:54,051
He testified at my trial.

995
01:19:54,135 --> 01:19:57,889
Testified to support you or
to oppose the death penalty?

996
01:19:57,972 --> 01:20:00,266
He testified against me.

997
01:20:00,349 --> 01:20:03,394
- Against you?
- He testified about the drinking.

998
01:20:03,477 --> 01:20:06,564
Alcohol is a mitigating
factor in capital cases.

999
01:20:07,982 --> 01:20:10,568
I always told myself that
he did it in some sick way...

1000
01:20:10,651 --> 01:20:12,945
to try to help me get
a reduced sentenced.

1001
01:20:14,780 --> 01:20:16,782
I guess he believes
I really killed her.

1002
01:20:17,867 --> 01:20:20,119
Dusty's a man easily blinded by hatred.

1003
01:20:22,705 --> 01:20:24,957
Maybe he hated you because
you were seeing Constance.

1004
01:20:25,041 --> 01:20:27,418
I wasn't seeing Constance.

1005
01:20:27,501 --> 01:20:29,295
She had your semen inside her.

1006
01:20:29,378 --> 01:20:32,381
I know. Look, it's just... It's a
little more complicated than that.

1007
01:20:35,509 --> 01:20:37,511
Respect for life means every life.!

1008
01:20:37,595 --> 01:20:39,972
Respect for life means every life.!

1009
01:20:40,056 --> 01:20:42,808
Respect for life means every life!

1010
01:20:42,892 --> 01:20:46,520
Respect for life means every life!
Respect for life means every life!

1011
01:20:46,562 --> 01:20:48,689
Respect for life means every life!

1012
01:20:59,533 --> 01:21:02,161
When you kill someone,
you rob their family.

1013
01:21:02,245 --> 01:21:05,706
Not just of a loved one
but of their humanity.

1014
01:21:05,748 --> 01:21:08,292
You harden their hearts with hate.

1015
01:21:08,376 --> 01:21:11,796
You take away their capacity
for civilized dispassion.

1016
01:21:11,879 --> 01:21:15,424
You condemn them to blood lust.

1017
01:21:15,508 --> 01:21:18,678
It's a cruel and horrible thing.

1018
01:21:18,761 --> 01:21:23,099
- But indulging that
hate will never help.

1019
01:21:23,182 --> 01:21:25,476
The damage is done.

1020
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:28,896
And once we've had our pound
of flesh, we're still hungry.

1021
01:21:28,938 --> 01:21:30,898
We leave the death house muttering...

1022
01:21:30,940 --> 01:21:34,360
that lethal injection was
just too good for them.

1023
01:21:34,443 --> 01:21:36,362
In the end, a civilized society...

1024
01:21:36,445 --> 01:21:39,407
must live with a hard truth.

1025
01:21:39,490 --> 01:21:42,994
He who seeks revenge digs two graves.

1026
01:21:43,077 --> 01:21:45,705
They're bringing
Betty Sue's people out.

1027
01:21:47,623 --> 01:21:49,584
Thank you, Dusty.

1028
01:22:04,807 --> 01:22:07,685
Just look. Look at those losers.

1029
01:22:07,768 --> 01:22:11,355
Rednecks, ghetto hustlers,
drug addicts, schizophrenics.

1030
01:22:11,439 --> 01:22:13,774
They're murderers, and
who cares if they die?

1031
01:22:13,816 --> 01:22:19,739
Who cares if the cycle, if it
just goes on and on and on and on?

1032
01:22:19,822 --> 01:22:21,782
Who cares?

1033
01:22:23,910 --> 01:22:25,912
Who cares?

1034
01:22:39,675 --> 01:22:42,511
Hey, did you make it
to your meeting today?

1035
01:22:42,553 --> 01:22:47,308
Yeah. I think I have to
find one less guru-like.

1036
01:22:48,851 --> 01:22:52,438
- Did you take your, uh, medicine?
- Mm-hmm.

1037
01:22:52,521 --> 01:22:54,857
Feel better?

1038
01:22:56,067 --> 01:23:00,154
- Mm
-hmm.

1039
01:23:02,073 --> 01:23:05,826
You know those stages of Kubler-Ross?

1040
01:23:05,868 --> 01:23:07,995
The ones the dying go through?

1041
01:23:09,038 --> 01:23:12,208
Um, anger...

1042
01:23:13,334 --> 01:23:15,836
denial...

1043
01:23:15,878 --> 01:23:18,005
bargaining...

1044
01:23:18,047 --> 01:23:20,591
uh...

1045
01:23:20,675 --> 01:23:23,386
- Depression.
- Depression, acceptance.

1046
01:23:23,427 --> 01:23:25,388
- Which one are you?
- Denial.

1047
01:23:25,471 --> 01:23:28,307
Well, denial's good. That's
a... That's a good one.

1048
01:23:28,391 --> 01:23:33,521
- The whole idea of there
being a process makes me tired.

1049
01:23:33,563 --> 01:23:36,649
I'm not up to the
job of dying person...

1050
01:23:36,732 --> 01:23:39,110
marveling at blades of grass...

1051
01:23:39,193 --> 01:23:42,154
lecturing strangers
to relish every moment.

1052
01:23:43,239 --> 01:23:45,658
- Mending bridges.
- Mending bridges.

1053
01:23:45,741 --> 01:23:48,536
- Confessing regret. Ohh.

1054
01:23:48,578 --> 01:23:51,455
- Oh, what, no regrets?
- Nope.

1055
01:23:52,790 --> 01:23:55,001
Wow.

1056
01:23:56,794 --> 01:23:58,796
I take that back.

1057
01:24:00,214 --> 01:24:03,551
- I wish I'd had a child.
- Yeah, so do I.

1058
01:24:03,593 --> 01:24:05,595
- I'm sorry, David.
- No.

1059
01:24:09,265 --> 01:24:12,768
I guess I just wish I had risked more.

1060
01:24:14,437 --> 01:24:18,232
Oh, and not enough sex.
Should have had more sex.

1061
01:24:18,274 --> 01:24:20,985
- Really?
- Mm.

1062
01:24:23,779 --> 01:24:28,826
Well, how... How many
lovers did you have?

1063
01:24:28,910 --> 01:24:32,288
- Including college?
- Including college.

1064
01:24:41,964 --> 01:24:46,928
Well, sex is really... You know,
it's not all it's cracked up to be.

1065
01:24:46,969 --> 01:24:50,264
- It's so overrated.

1066
01:24:50,306 --> 01:24:52,600
- You should have had more sex.
- Mm-hmm.

1067
01:24:55,394 --> 01:24:58,397
You work so hard not to
be seen as a sex object.

1068
01:25:00,358 --> 01:25:02,610
Before long, you're not seen at all.

1069
01:25:04,946 --> 01:25:06,948
Hey.

1070
01:25:07,949 --> 01:25:09,951
I see you.

1071
01:25:15,998 --> 01:25:19,252
- You want to make it five?

1072
01:25:19,335 --> 01:25:23,422
- Complete the hand.
- What, a pity lay?

1073
01:25:25,091 --> 01:25:28,344
- No, thanks.
- Hey.

1074
01:25:33,516 --> 01:25:36,102
It wouldn't be pity.

1075
01:25:55,121 --> 01:25:57,873
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Don't worry.

1076
01:25:57,915 --> 01:26:00,042
No, it's good.

1077
01:26:00,126 --> 01:26:02,587
Just talk to me. Let
me hear your voice.

1078
01:26:02,670 --> 01:26:06,716
- I'm here. I'm here.
- Okay. Just hold me tight.

1079
01:26:07,884 --> 01:26:10,344
Just tight. I'm so scared.

1080
01:26:10,386 --> 01:26:12,638
- Okay. I'm sorry.
- No. Don't stop.

1081
01:26:12,722 --> 01:26:14,640
- Just...
- Okay.

1082
01:26:14,724 --> 01:26:17,685
Stay with me, please.
Please stay with me.

1083
01:26:17,727 --> 01:26:21,689
- I'm not going anywhere.
- I just need to feel you inside.

1084
01:26:21,731 --> 01:26:23,691
I'm right here.

1085
01:26:23,733 --> 01:26:26,152
I'm so tired.

1086
01:26:29,906 --> 01:26:32,825
I'm so tired of being so afraid.

1087
01:26:34,577 --> 01:26:40,082
- I'm right here.
- Help me. Help me, please. Just...

1088
01:26:40,166 --> 01:26:42,919
- Just make it go away.
- Okay. Okay.

1089
01:26:43,002 --> 01:26:47,673
- Make it go away.
- Okay. I'm right here.

1090
01:26:49,508 --> 01:26:51,510
I'm not going anywhere.

1091
01:28:30,192 --> 01:28:33,404
- Can I help you?
- Oh. No. I'm leaving.

1092
01:28:33,487 --> 01:28:35,489
I-I'm sorry. Thanks.

1093
01:29:49,397 --> 01:29:51,482
It was Dusty.

1094
01:29:51,566 --> 01:29:54,652
He had a motive. He knew you
both. He visited that morning.

1095
01:29:54,735 --> 01:29:57,738
If I could answer that for sure...

1096
01:29:57,780 --> 01:30:00,700
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

1097
01:30:00,783 --> 01:30:03,869
It's what I need you for.
That's why I chose you.

1098
01:30:03,953 --> 01:30:07,790
- Now I've told you everything.
- But I still don't know.

1099
01:30:07,873 --> 01:30:11,168
- I need more time.
- You'll find time.

1100
01:30:11,252 --> 01:30:13,337
You should have done this earlier.

1101
01:30:13,421 --> 01:30:16,132
You're not here to save me.

1102
01:30:16,215 --> 01:30:19,135
You're here to save my
son's memory of his father.

1103
01:30:20,970 --> 01:30:23,139
That's all I want.

1104
01:30:25,141 --> 01:30:27,059
You're gonna let them kill you.

1105
01:30:27,143 --> 01:30:30,605
Bitsey, we spend our whole
lives trying to stop death.

1106
01:30:31,814 --> 01:30:36,027
Eating, inventing, loving, praying...

1107
01:30:37,028 --> 01:30:40,573
fighting, killing.

1108
01:30:41,824 --> 01:30:44,368
But what do we really know about death?

1109
01:30:44,452 --> 01:30:46,537
Just that nobody comes back.

1110
01:30:48,247 --> 01:30:50,249
But there comes a point in life...

1111
01:30:51,334 --> 01:30:53,336
a moment...

1112
01:30:53,419 --> 01:30:56,923
when your mind outlives its desires...

1113
01:30:58,257 --> 01:31:00,259
its obsessions...

1114
01:31:01,510 --> 01:31:04,347
when your habits...

1115
01:31:04,388 --> 01:31:06,390
survive your dreams...

1116
01:31:09,352 --> 01:31:12,021
and when your losses...

1117
01:31:18,069 --> 01:31:20,112
Maybe death is a gift.

1118
01:31:22,323 --> 01:31:26,994
- You wonder.
- That's it. Let's go, Gale.

1119
01:31:32,124 --> 01:31:35,711
All I can tell you is that by
this time tomorrow I'll be dead.

1120
01:31:37,046 --> 01:31:39,006
I know when.

1121
01:31:40,132 --> 01:31:42,134
I just can't say why.

1122
01:31:44,220 --> 01:31:46,889
You have 24 hours to find out.

1123
01:31:52,937 --> 01:31:55,356
Good-bye, Bitsey.

1124
01:32:50,161 --> 01:32:52,163
- Ms. Bloom?
- Yeah.

1125
01:32:53,998 --> 01:32:56,751
Thought I'd return your
coat. Gettin' kinda chilly.

1126
01:32:56,792 --> 01:33:00,922
- Any news from our video intruder friend?
- No. Any word on the appeal?

1127
01:33:00,963 --> 01:33:04,008
Denied. Tape went to a
federal judge two hours ago.

1128
01:33:04,091 --> 01:33:07,053
Now what you got was
definitely a snippet.

1129
01:33:07,136 --> 01:33:10,348
Could be your video supplier friend
has more nasty previews scheduled.

1130
01:33:10,431 --> 01:33:13,893
Best you not get into too
much sightseeing right now.

1131
01:33:13,976 --> 01:33:16,729
Just stick close to your motel room.

1132
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:23,611
- How's David?
- He's holding up. Gonna be a hard night.

1133
01:33:23,653 --> 01:33:28,074
Will you tell him I'll take care
of it? About his son, I mean.

1134
01:33:28,157 --> 01:33:31,118
I'll do that. You
stayin' for the execution?

1135
01:33:33,955 --> 01:33:36,249
Then I'll see you
tomorrow. Watch yourselves.

1136
01:33:37,250 --> 01:33:39,085
Mr. Belyeu?

1137
01:33:40,670 --> 01:33:43,005
Were Dusty Wright and Constance close?

1138
01:33:43,089 --> 01:33:46,217
Oh, yeah. Thick as thieves, those two.

1139
01:33:46,300 --> 01:33:51,097
- Lovers?
- Whoa. You plowin' a little too close to the cotton, Bitsey.

1140
01:33:51,180 --> 01:33:55,309
That was just a rumor.
Nothing more. Night-night.

1141
01:36:57,617 --> 01:36:59,702
Zack, wake up.

1142
01:36:59,785 --> 01:37:01,704
- Did you throw the towel on the floor?
- What?

1143
01:37:01,787 --> 01:37:04,415
This towel was on my bathroom
floor. Did you throw it there?

1144
01:37:04,498 --> 01:37:06,459
Yeah, I guess. What, it's a motel.

1145
01:37:06,542 --> 01:37:08,461
- Would you do that at home?
- No.

1146
01:37:08,544 --> 01:37:11,380
Jesus, Bitsey, it's not like we're
staying in the friggin' Four Seasons.

1147
01:37:11,464 --> 01:37:14,467
Come on. Get the TV.
We're taking it with us.

1148
01:37:14,550 --> 01:37:16,469
Taking it with us? What
are you talking about?

1149
01:37:16,552 --> 01:37:18,888
- Where we going?
- Austin.

1150
01:37:18,930 --> 01:37:21,098
- Get the TV.
- All right.

1151
01:37:25,645 --> 01:37:27,647
Come on.

1152
01:37:49,627 --> 01:37:52,713
- Wanna make a hundred bucks?
- A hundred bucks? What do I gotta do?

1153
01:37:52,755 --> 01:37:54,840
We're going over the crime scene.

1154
01:37:54,924 --> 01:37:56,884
Put the TV on the bed, Zack.

1155
01:38:00,137 --> 01:38:04,684
Now, for the next hour, I want you to do
exactly what I say when I say to do it.

1156
01:38:04,767 --> 01:38:06,686
If I say jump, you jump.

1157
01:38:06,769 --> 01:38:08,896
- You want me to jump?
- That's just a figure of speech.

1158
01:38:08,938 --> 01:38:11,899
- Your boyfriend put the tripod back.
- He's not my boyfriend anymore.

1159
01:38:11,941 --> 01:38:13,985
- Do you still have a video camera?
- Yeah.

1160
01:38:14,068 --> 01:38:15,987
- Good. Get it.
- I gotta collect first.

1161
01:38:16,070 --> 01:38:18,364
Zack, give her the money.

1162
01:38:25,746 --> 01:38:29,542
Can you move that stuff off the
counter for me? By the lamp? Yeah.

1163
01:38:29,625 --> 01:38:32,628
Yeah. Thanks.

1164
01:38:36,799 --> 01:38:40,386
- Put the gloves on the dish rack.
- I don't have a dish rack.

1165
01:38:40,469 --> 01:38:43,306
- Zack, could you...
- Yeah.

1166
01:38:48,227 --> 01:38:50,229
Turn them inside out.

1167
01:38:52,982 --> 01:38:55,276
And put-put the duct
tape on the floor.

1168
01:38:56,736 --> 01:38:58,613
By the stove.

1169
01:39:00,907 --> 01:39:02,825
Okay.

1170
01:39:02,909 --> 01:39:07,079
- Now. Could you... What's your name?
- Nico's fine.

1171
01:39:07,163 --> 01:39:12,251
Nico, I want you to lie
down facing the counter.

1172
01:39:13,794 --> 01:39:16,088
We can imagine that part.

1173
01:39:20,676 --> 01:39:23,679
- Zack, put her in position.
- Okay.

1174
01:39:25,848 --> 01:39:28,726
All right. Move... Just move this way.

1175
01:39:28,809 --> 01:39:32,438
- All right.
- Yeah, forward. Forward. There.

1176
01:39:32,521 --> 01:39:35,816
Okay. On her side. Right.

1177
01:39:35,858 --> 01:39:40,571
Her top leg out a little. There.

1178
01:39:42,865 --> 01:39:45,493
Okay. Now, look at this.

1179
01:39:50,831 --> 01:39:54,627
She moves her foot. I noticed
this back at the motel.

1180
01:39:54,710 --> 01:39:59,924
She moves her foot quite
deliberately, and then she's still.

1181
01:40:00,007 --> 01:40:03,177
For another 15 seconds she's still.

1182
01:40:03,219 --> 01:40:06,514
And then she starts to struggle.
Now that doesn't make sense.

1183
01:40:06,556 --> 01:40:10,685
If this was a murder, she'd just be
struggling and then be still. She'd be dead.

1184
01:40:10,768 --> 01:40:14,480
Maybe she was faking,
hoping he'd go away.

1185
01:40:16,524 --> 01:40:18,526
Or...

1186
01:40:21,487 --> 01:40:25,116
- We've got to bag her.
- We're going a little bit too far here.

1187
01:40:27,994 --> 01:40:29,996
Okay.

1188
01:40:33,165 --> 01:40:36,085
- I'll do it.
- Uh...

1189
01:40:37,336 --> 01:40:39,255
Uh-huh.

1190
01:40:39,338 --> 01:40:41,340
Uh-huh.

1191
01:40:42,675 --> 01:40:45,887
Well, thank you, Bobbi. Thank you.

1192
01:40:58,274 --> 01:41:00,693
Supreme Court death
clerk gave the go-ahead.

1193
01:41:09,952 --> 01:41:12,747
Give the keys to Zack and
stand over there by the tripod.

1194
01:41:12,788 --> 01:41:15,124
I want you to wait three minutes
before you take the bag off.

1195
01:41:15,166 --> 01:41:17,460
I'm really not so sure about
this. It's way too dangerous.

1196
01:41:17,543 --> 01:41:20,796
Three full minutes, Zack.
Stand over there with her.

1197
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:23,424
And keep your eyes on your watch.

1198
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:57,708
Go ahead.

1199
01:41:57,792 --> 01:42:00,753
- Twenty-two seconds...
- She shouldn't be doin' this.

1200
01:42:20,690 --> 01:42:23,067
Oh, my God.

1201
01:42:28,447 --> 01:42:30,324
This isn't cool!

1202
01:42:32,451 --> 01:42:34,787
- Bitsey?

1203
01:42:34,870 --> 01:42:38,124
No more experiments, all right?
Just tell me what's going on.

1204
01:42:38,207 --> 01:42:41,043
- Are you okay?
- She did it herself.

1205
01:42:41,127 --> 01:42:43,754
Ohh.

1206
01:42:43,838 --> 01:42:47,049
She did it herself. Ohh.

1207
01:43:10,406 --> 01:43:13,868
She used the gloves to keep her
fingerprints off the tape and bag.

1208
01:43:13,910 --> 01:43:15,870
Then she put them back
on the disk rack...

1209
01:43:15,912 --> 01:43:19,540
but upside-down and
inside-out, a housewife's habit.

1210
01:43:19,624 --> 01:43:22,585
Now, a murderer would have
just tossed them aside...

1211
01:43:22,668 --> 01:43:26,797
- like you do with a towel in a crap motel.
- Maybe. All right, maybe.

1212
01:43:26,881 --> 01:43:31,719
- But why wear these?
- Well, they threw me. But she needed them.

1213
01:43:31,761 --> 01:43:34,555
She knew that she would
instinctively try to rip the bag off.

1214
01:43:34,597 --> 01:43:36,933
And she swallowed the key
so she couldn't get to it.

1215
01:43:37,016 --> 01:43:39,227
She made sure there was no way out.

1216
01:43:39,310 --> 01:43:42,188
Why not hang yourself or take pills?

1217
01:43:42,271 --> 01:43:45,566
- Why take your clothes off? Why make it look like a murder?
- I don't know.

1218
01:43:45,608 --> 01:43:47,652
It's so calculated.

1219
01:43:47,735 --> 01:43:50,655
She's handcuffed, taped at the
mouth, the gloves, the tripod...

1220
01:43:50,738 --> 01:43:54,659
Why, Bitsey, why fake your own
murder? It doesn't make sense.

1221
01:43:54,742 --> 01:43:58,246
The woman's a bleeding-heart
abolitionist. Why frame an innocent man?

1222
01:43:58,287 --> 01:44:00,081
- Why send Gale to the chair for what...
- What?

1223
01:44:00,122 --> 01:44:03,209
She had to know some innocent
jerk would take the fall.

1224
01:44:04,585 --> 01:44:08,798
Oh, my God, Zack. That's it.

1225
01:44:09,882 --> 01:44:12,051
That's why. To prove it happens.

1226
01:44:12,134 --> 01:44:16,055
- To have absolute proof that the system convicts innocents.
- Get out of here.

1227
01:44:16,138 --> 01:44:18,849
No. That's how she thought.

1228
01:44:18,933 --> 01:44:21,477
Come on, think about it. This
woman lived for DeathWatch.

1229
01:44:21,561 --> 01:44:24,689
If she's gonna die
anyway, why not die for it?

1230
01:44:24,772 --> 01:44:29,110
That's why the tripod was here,
to record proof, undeniable proof.

1231
01:44:29,151 --> 01:44:31,988
- That's why we got the video.
- So a dead woman put the tape in your room?

1232
01:44:32,071 --> 01:44:34,407
No, of course not. I
mean, she needed help.

1233
01:44:34,490 --> 01:44:39,495
Someone to keep it, release it.
Someone dedicated to the cause.

1234
01:44:39,579 --> 01:44:42,748
Someone she could trust.

1235
01:45:24,457 --> 01:45:27,793
What a dump. The guy's a freak.

1236
01:45:29,879 --> 01:45:31,881
Come on.

1237
01:45:48,814 --> 01:45:52,944
Dusty's a bullhorner, a zealot
who's O.D.'d on too many good causes.

1238
01:45:53,027 --> 01:45:55,488
You know, the original plan
was probably for Dusty...

1239
01:45:55,571 --> 01:45:57,949
to release the tape
after Gale's conviction.

1240
01:45:58,032 --> 01:45:59,951
You know, after a year or so.

1241
01:46:00,034 --> 01:46:02,662
It'd force him to dry out,
give him back his dignity.

1242
01:46:03,996 --> 01:46:07,291
So Dusty Wright is sitting
on this tape, waiting.

1243
01:46:07,375 --> 01:46:10,503
And he's the only one
who knows about it.

1244
01:46:10,586 --> 01:46:13,172
So good ol' Dusty starts to think
that an erroneous execution...

1245
01:46:13,256 --> 01:46:15,633
is a lot more politically
useful than a last-minute save.

1246
01:46:15,716 --> 01:46:18,803
Because a last-minute save would
only prove the system works.

1247
01:46:18,886 --> 01:46:21,556
Almost-martyrs don't count.

1248
01:46:21,639 --> 01:46:26,185
Dusty's thinking, what's one
murder if it stops thousands?

1249
01:46:26,269 --> 01:46:30,064
So he'll release the whole
tape only after the execution.

1250
01:46:34,110 --> 01:46:36,112
Which means he must have
the original somewhere.

1251
01:46:37,530 --> 01:46:40,616
- What time is it?
- It's 4:50.

1252
01:46:40,700 --> 01:46:42,702
Oh, Bitsey, Jesus!

1253
01:47:07,977 --> 01:47:10,897
I wanna talk about your tape.

1254
01:47:10,980 --> 01:47:14,525
No. Meet me down the hill at
the gas station in 15 minutes.

1255
01:47:14,609 --> 01:47:16,777
Zack!

1256
01:47:17,820 --> 01:47:19,488
Don't move from the phone.

1257
01:47:19,572 --> 01:47:22,283
Call the second you see his
pickup. Let it ring just once.

1258
01:47:22,325 --> 01:47:24,493
- Then get into the woods.
- I know. Go.

1259
01:47:24,577 --> 01:47:27,163
- Into the woods, Zack.
- Go!

1260
01:47:50,019 --> 01:47:53,272
Details of Gale's last
meal were released today.

1261
01:47:53,356 --> 01:47:55,650
And they included pancakes
with maple syrup...

1262
01:47:55,691 --> 01:47:59,362
All executions in the state of
Texas take place at 6:00 p.m.

1263
01:47:59,445 --> 01:48:02,990
- Four pancakes. Maple syrup.
- Four pancakes. Maple syrup.

1264
01:48:03,032 --> 01:48:07,870
- Fresh strawberries.
- After completion of last words, the injection is administered.

1265
01:48:07,954 --> 01:48:10,665
- Fresh strawberries... large.
- Fresh strawberries... large.
- Fresh strawberries.

1266
01:48:10,706 --> 01:48:13,042
Sodium penthonal for
sedation purposes...

1267
01:48:13,125 --> 01:48:15,878
- Reddi-wip whipped cream.
- Puts you to sleep.
- Reddi-wip whipped cream.

1268
01:48:15,962 --> 01:48:17,964
- Pancuronium bromide...
- Chocolate shavings...

1269
01:48:18,047 --> 01:48:20,174
- extra chocolate.
- To collapse the diaphragm and lungs.

1270
01:48:20,216 --> 01:48:22,510
Potassium chloride to stop the heart.

1271
01:48:22,552 --> 01:48:25,513
- Chocolate shavings, extra chocolate.
- And chocolate shavings.

1272
01:48:25,555 --> 01:48:27,848
The whole cocktail costs
the state of Texas...

1273
01:48:27,890 --> 01:48:32,311
approximately $86.08 per elimination.

1274
01:50:20,419 --> 01:50:23,381
- What do you miss most? Food.
- Food.

1275
01:50:30,513 --> 01:50:33,182
- Talk to her in horse talk?
- No.

1276
01:50:34,809 --> 01:50:36,811
Damn.

1277
01:50:53,369 --> 01:50:55,329
Damn!

1278
01:50:56,372 --> 01:50:58,332
Come on, cowboy, where are you?

1279
01:50:58,374 --> 01:51:02,211
8:30 p.m. We checked the
next hotel on the list.

1280
01:51:06,716 --> 01:51:09,802
- Come on.

1281
01:51:09,886 --> 01:51:12,013
Shit!

1282
01:51:40,708 --> 01:51:42,877
It's ready?

1283
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:14,302
- Fuck!
- He didn't show up! Come on!

1284
01:53:17,179 --> 01:53:20,099
Please, Bitsy, come on.

1285
01:53:47,293 --> 01:53:49,212
Call everyone, Zack.

1286
01:53:49,295 --> 01:53:52,590
The governor, the warden, New York,
the goddamn Supreme Court death clerk.

1287
01:53:52,673 --> 01:53:55,301
- How far is it?
- You've got eight minutes, maybe more.

1288
01:53:55,384 --> 01:53:57,803
- We'll make it. We'll make it.
- You can do it.

1289
01:53:57,887 --> 01:53:59,847
Go! Go! Go!

1290
01:54:10,399 --> 01:54:12,360
Shower. Go.

1291
01:54:26,666 --> 01:54:28,668
My God.

1292
01:54:30,253 --> 01:54:33,548
- Give me the time.
- On that big pile-up on I-35...

1293
01:54:33,589 --> 01:54:35,383
Give me the goddamn time.

1294
01:54:54,610 --> 01:54:58,823
Oh, no. Not now. Not fucking now.

1295
01:55:24,223 --> 01:55:25,975
Shit! Shit! Shit!

1296
01:55:30,479 --> 01:55:32,815
Come on. Fuck. Fuck!

1297
01:56:08,309 --> 01:56:11,479
Stop executions.

1298
01:56:17,443 --> 01:56:19,695
Hey, get the fuck off
my spot, all right?

1299
01:56:23,491 --> 01:56:25,284
Thank you.

1300
01:56:25,368 --> 01:56:27,495
- How tight are you?
- I got your two buttons.

1301
01:56:27,537 --> 01:56:30,289
Testing one, two...

1302
01:56:30,373 --> 01:56:33,501
- How's my, uh, light?
- A little shine right there.

1303
01:56:33,543 --> 01:56:37,213
- I think he's doing Larry King Live at 8:00.
- Oh. Can I smile?

1304
01:56:37,296 --> 01:56:39,382
Opinion polls conducted
over the weekend show...

1305
01:56:39,465 --> 01:56:43,094
that 66% of all Americans are
in favor of the death penalty.

1306
01:56:43,177 --> 01:56:45,429
Maybe you can get a
shot of the protesters.

1307
01:56:45,513 --> 01:56:48,391
You can see over here that
the people are represented...

1308
01:56:48,474 --> 01:56:52,728
- by 50% pro, 50% anti
-death.

1309
01:56:52,812 --> 01:56:56,566
Hiddee-hiddee-hiddee-ho.!
Time for David Gale to go.!

1310
01:57:00,736 --> 01:57:03,698
When Caine killed Abel, God
cast him out. He didn't kill him.

1311
01:57:03,739 --> 01:57:08,369
He raped and killed that poor girl. As
far as I'm concerned, he should die for it.

1312
01:57:11,038 --> 01:57:13,916
Hiddee-hiddee-hiddee-ho.!

1313
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:17,044
- Murderers!
- Time for David Gale to go.

1314
01:57:22,675 --> 01:57:26,012
They said on TV that he raped her
first and then he strangled her.

1315
01:57:26,095 --> 01:57:29,473
- I think he deserves to die.
- They stick that thing in his arm and he goes to sleep.

1316
01:57:29,557 --> 01:57:31,809
If you ask me, they ought
to use a goddamn pickax.

1317
01:57:56,125 --> 01:58:00,213
- You're the murderer!
- He should die.

1318
01:58:03,299 --> 01:58:06,260
A little-bitty pin prick.

1319
01:58:07,595 --> 01:58:11,974
The state of Texas has
executed David Gale.

1320
01:58:13,059 --> 01:58:17,021
He was pronounced dead at 6:12 p.m.

1321
01:58:17,104 --> 01:58:19,065
Strapped to the gurney at 6:02.

1322
01:58:19,148 --> 01:58:22,485
- David Gale was officially pronounced dead...
- at 6:12 this evening.

1323
01:58:22,568 --> 01:58:26,530
- Texas has executed David...
- Gale was pronounced dead at 6:12.

1324
01:58:26,614 --> 01:58:30,535
Death was pronounced at 6:12 this
evening at the prison in Huntsville.

1325
01:58:33,538 --> 01:58:36,040
Since none of the victim's
relatives was in attendance...

1326
01:58:36,123 --> 01:58:39,001
there will be no statement
from the victim's family.

1327
01:59:18,207 --> 01:59:22,670
Here's what we know so far. Last night,
NEWS Magazine posted on their web site...

1328
01:59:22,712 --> 01:59:25,298
a video obtained by
reporter Bitsey Bloom.

1329
01:59:25,381 --> 01:59:28,968
- The footage appears to show...
- Constance Harraway committing suicide.

1330
01:59:29,051 --> 01:59:32,847
Bloom reports that she received the tape
Friday morning in a motel in Huntsville...

1331
01:59:32,889 --> 01:59:36,225
where she was staying while
conducting Gale's last interview.

1332
01:59:41,397 --> 01:59:44,191
Apparently, the tape has
been in the possession...

1333
01:59:44,233 --> 01:59:48,070
of former DeathWatch
employee Dustin Emil Wright.

1334
01:59:50,531 --> 01:59:53,326
As you can see, police have been in
and out of his cabin all morning...

1335
01:59:53,409 --> 01:59:55,620
looking for clues to his whereabouts.

1336
01:59:55,703 --> 01:59:59,999
- Since his 1994 conviction...
- On death row awaiting execution.

1337
02:00:00,082 --> 02:00:04,253
Blacks and Latinos are five times more
likely to face the death penalty than whites.

1338
02:00:04,337 --> 02:00:06,714
A fanatic in the movement
to stop the death penalty.

1339
02:00:06,756 --> 02:00:09,800
- It's all there?
- Actively seeking a Dustin Wright.

1340
02:00:09,884 --> 02:00:14,013
- A Dustin Wright.
- It appears Wright withheld a tape to make...

1341
02:00:14,096 --> 02:00:18,059
a political point about the potential
for error in capital punishment cases.

1342
02:00:18,100 --> 02:00:21,479
Passport and ticket as well.

1343
02:00:21,562 --> 02:00:23,648
Dana, what everyone here is asking...

1344
02:00:23,731 --> 02:00:26,067
It's a terrible tragedy, and
there will be a full investigation.

1345
02:00:26,108 --> 02:00:29,779
And I assure you this man Dusty Wright
will be caught and shown swift justice.

1346
02:00:29,862 --> 02:00:33,241
- Justice for Christ's sake!
- The people of Texas are not deterred.

1347
02:00:33,282 --> 02:00:36,369
We're still solidly behind the
death penalty because it works.

1348
02:00:36,452 --> 02:00:40,373
The system cannot be blamed for the acts of
one deranged individual with an ax to grind.

1349
02:00:40,456 --> 02:00:42,959
And people have been put to death
in the name of this justice.!

1350
02:00:43,042 --> 02:00:46,462
Let's not throw the baby out
with the bath water, folks.

1351
02:00:51,467 --> 02:00:54,470
Of course, the ultimate
irony is that David Gale...

1352
02:00:54,554 --> 02:00:56,722
The man who became
an unwitting martyr...

1353
02:00:56,806 --> 02:00:58,891
May achieve in death
what he worked for...

1354
02:00:58,975 --> 02:01:00,935
But could not accomplish in life.

1355
02:01:00,977 --> 02:01:04,188
This is A.J. Roberts
reporting from Bastrop, Texas.

1356
02:01:31,424 --> 02:01:34,093
- Gracias.
- De nada.

1357
02:02:05,416 --> 02:02:07,418
This just came.

1358
02:02:37,031 --> 02:02:39,158
- Is it David's?
- Sي.

1359
02:03:30,293 --> 02:03:33,546
"Key to your freedom." What?

1360
02:04:29,936 --> 02:04:32,355
