1
00:01:19,463 --> 00:01:22,758
<i>Once upon a time, in a faraway land</i>,

2
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:25,594
<i>a young prince lived</i>
<i>in a shining castle</i>.

3
00:01:26,804 --> 00:01:29,932
<i>Although he had everything</i>
<i>his heart desired</i>,

4
00:01:30,057 --> 00:01:34,395
<i>the prince was spoiled</i>,
<i>selfish and unkind</i>.

5
00:01:35,771 --> 00:01:37,898
<i>But then, one winter</i>'<i>s night</i>,

6
00:01:38,023 --> 00:01:40,651
<i>an old beggar woman came</i>
<i>to the castle</i>

7
00:01:40,776 --> 00:01:43,612
<i>and offered him a single rose</i>

8
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:47,074
<i>in return for shelter from the bitter cold</i>.

9
00:01:47,199 --> 00:01:49,743
<i>Repulsed by her haggard appearance</i>,

10
00:01:49,868 --> 00:01:54,540
<i>the prince sneered at the gift</i>
<i>and turned the old woman away</i>.

11
00:01:54,665 --> 00:01:58,127
<i>But she warned him</i>
<i>not to be deceived by appearances</i>,

12
00:01:58,252 --> 00:02:01,296
<i>for beauty is found within</i>.

13
00:02:01,422 --> 00:02:06,176
<i>And when he dismissed her again</i>,
<i>the old woman</i>'<i>s ugliness melted away</i>

14
00:02:06,302 --> 00:02:10,180
<i>to reveal a beautiful enchantress</i>.

15
00:02:10,306 --> 00:02:13,434
<i>The prince tried to apologize</i>,
<i>but it was too late</i>,

16
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:17,062
<i>for she had seen</i>
<i>that there was no love in his heart</i>.

17
00:02:17,187 --> 00:02:18,230
<i>And as punishment</i>,

18
00:02:18,355 --> 00:02:20,941
<i>she transformed him</i>
<i>into a hideous beast</i>

19
00:02:21,066 --> 00:02:25,738
<i>and placed a powerful spell</i>
<i>on the castle and all who lived there</i>.

20
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:29,283
<i>Ashamed of his monstrous form</i>,

21
00:02:29,408 --> 00:02:32,202
<i>the Beast concealed himself</i>
<i>inside his castle</i>

22
00:02:32,328 --> 00:02:36,457
<i>with a magic mirror as his only window</i>
<i>to the outside world</i>.

23
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:40,336
<i>The rose she had offered</i>

24
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:42,880
<i>was truly an enchanted rose</i>,

25
00:02:43,005 --> 00:02:46,550
<i>which would bloom until his 2 1 st year</i>.

26
00:02:46,675 --> 00:02:49,303
<i>If he could learn to love another</i>

27
00:02:49,428 --> 00:02:54,058
<i>and earn her love in return</i>
<i>by the time the last petal fell</i>,

28
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:57,061
<i>then the spell would be broken</i>.

29
00:02:57,936 --> 00:03:00,606
<i>If not, he would be doomed</i>

30
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:03,567
<i>to remain a beast for all time</i>.

31
00:03:05,277 --> 00:03:07,363
<i>As the years passed</i>,

32
00:03:07,488 --> 00:03:11,784
<i>he fell into despair and lost all hope</i>,

33
00:03:13,035 --> 00:03:17,039
<i>for who could ever learn</i>
<i>to love a beast?</i>

34
00:03:43,774 --> 00:03:47,903
<i>Little town, it</i>'<i>s a quiet village</i>

35
00:03:48,779 --> 00:03:53,075
<i>Every day like the one before</i>

36
00:03:53,742 --> 00:03:58,163
<i>Little town, full of little people</i>

37
00:03:58,288 --> 00:04:03,377
<i>Waking up to say</i>...

38
00:04:07,631 --> 00:04:11,427
<i>There goes the baker</i>
<i>with his tray, like always</i>

39
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:14,638
<i>The same old bread and rolls to sell</i>

40
00:04:14,763 --> 00:04:16,473
<i>Every morning just the same</i>

41
00:04:16,598 --> 00:04:18,434
<i>Since the morning that we came</i>

42
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,185
<i>To this poor provincial town</i>

43
00:04:20,311 --> 00:04:22,062
-Good morning, Belle.
-Morning, <i>monsieur</i>.

44
00:04:22,187 --> 00:04:23,856
-Where you off to?
-The bookshop.

45
00:04:23,981 --> 00:04:26,233
I just finished the most wonderful story

46
00:04:26,358 --> 00:04:28,944
-about a beanstalk and an ogre and...
-That's nice.

47
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:32,156
Marie, the baguettes! Hurry up!

48
00:04:32,281 --> 00:04:35,868
<i>Look, there she goes</i>
<i>The girl is strange, no question</i>

49
00:04:35,993 --> 00:04:39,204
<i>Dazed and distracted, can</i>'<i>t you tell?</i>

50
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,165
<i>Never part of any crowd</i>

51
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,083
'<i>Cause her head</i>'<i>s up on some cloud</i>

52
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:47,254
<i>No denying she</i>'<i>s a funny girl</i>
<i>that Belle</i>

53
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:49,089
-Bonjour
-<i>Good day</i>

54
00:04:49,214 --> 00:04:51,091
<i>How is your family?</i>

55
00:04:51,216 --> 00:04:53,052
-Bonjour
-<i>Good day</i>

56
00:04:53,177 --> 00:04:54,845
<i>How is your wife?</i>

57
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,764
<i>I need six eggs</i>

58
00:04:56,889 --> 00:04:58,182
<i>That</i>'<i>s too expensive</i>

59
00:04:58,307 --> 00:05:02,936
<i>There must be more</i>
<i>than this provincial life</i>

60
00:05:03,687 --> 00:05:04,938
-Belle.
-Good morning.

61
00:05:05,064 --> 00:05:06,774
I've come to return the book I borrowed.

62
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:07,900
Finished already?

63
00:05:08,025 --> 00:05:10,861
I couldn't put it down.
Have you got anything new?

64
00:05:10,986 --> 00:05:12,446
Not since yesterday.

65
00:05:12,571 --> 00:05:15,908
That's all right. I'll borrow this one.

66
00:05:16,033 --> 00:05:18,369
That one? But you've read it twice.

67
00:05:18,494 --> 00:05:19,828
Well, it's my favorite.

68
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:24,249
Far-off places, daring sword fights,
magic spells, a prince in disguise.

69
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:27,086
If you like it all that much, it's yours.

70
00:05:27,211 --> 00:05:28,962
-But, sir...
-l insist.

71
00:05:29,088 --> 00:05:32,174
Well, thank you. Thank you very much.

72
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:35,844
<i>Look, there she goes</i>
<i>That girl is so peculiar</i>

73
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:39,139
<i>I wonder if she</i>'<i>s feeling well</i>

74
00:05:39,264 --> 00:05:41,016
<i>With a dreamy, far-off look</i>

75
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:42,935
<i>And her nose stuck in a book</i>

76
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,730
<i>What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle</i>

77
00:05:49,274 --> 00:05:53,028
<i>Isn</i>'<i>t this amazing?</i>

78
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:55,489
<i>It</i>'<i>s my favorite part</i>

79
00:05:55,614 --> 00:06:02,079
<i>Because you</i>'<i>ll see</i>

80
00:06:02,204 --> 00:06:08,460
<i>Here</i>'<i>s where she meets</i>
<i>Prince Charming</i>

81
00:06:08,585 --> 00:06:12,631
<i>But she won</i>'<i>t discover that it</i>'<i>s him</i>

82
00:06:12,756 --> 00:06:15,968
<i>Till chapter three</i>

83
00:06:16,093 --> 00:06:17,803
Hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey!

84
00:06:17,928 --> 00:06:21,515
<i>Now it</i>'<i>s no wonder</i>
<i>that her name means beauty</i>

85
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,810
<i>Her looks have got no parallel</i>

86
00:06:24,935 --> 00:06:26,520
<i>But behind that fair facade</i>

87
00:06:26,645 --> 00:06:28,564
<i>I</i>'<i>m afraid she</i>'<i>s rather odd</i>

88
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:30,524
<i>Very different from the rest of us</i>

89
00:06:30,649 --> 00:06:32,276
<i>She</i>'<i>s nothing like the rest of us</i>

90
00:06:32,401 --> 00:06:36,196
<i>Yes, different from the rest of us</i>
<i>is Belle</i>

91
00:06:42,077 --> 00:06:44,038
Wow! You didn't miss a shot, Gaston.

92
00:06:44,163 --> 00:06:46,040
You're the greatest hunter
in the whole world!

93
00:06:46,165 --> 00:06:47,708
-I know.
-No beast alive

94
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,626
stands a chance against you.

95
00:06:49,752 --> 00:06:52,546
-And no girl, for that matter.
-It's true, LeFou.

96
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:55,215
And I've got my sights set on that one.

97
00:06:55,341 --> 00:06:57,426
-The inventor's daughter?
-She's the one.

98
00:06:57,551 --> 00:06:59,887
-The lucky girl I'm going to marry.
-But she...

99
00:07:00,012 --> 00:07:01,972
-The most beautiful girl in town.
-l know, but...

100
00:07:02,097 --> 00:07:04,183
That makes her the best.

101
00:07:04,308 --> 00:07:08,395
-And don't I deserve the best?
-Well, of course. I mean, you do.

102
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,316
<i>Right from the moment</i>
<i>when I met her, saw her</i>

103
00:07:12,441 --> 00:07:15,694
<i>I said she</i>'<i>s gorgeous, and I fell</i>

104
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:17,738
<i>Here in town there</i>'<i>s only she</i>

105
00:07:17,863 --> 00:07:19,615
<i>Who is beautiful as me</i>

106
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,869
<i>So I</i>'<i>m making plans</i>
<i>to woo and marry Belle</i>

107
00:07:23,994 --> 00:07:25,746
<i>Look, there he goes</i>

108
00:07:25,871 --> 00:07:27,581
<i>Isn</i>'<i>t he dreamy?</i>

109
00:07:27,706 --> 00:07:29,375
Monsieur <i>Gaston</i>

110
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,168
<i>Oh, he</i>'<i>s so cute</i>

111
00:07:31,293 --> 00:07:32,961
<i>Be still, my heart</i>

112
00:07:33,087 --> 00:07:34,421
<i>I</i>'<i>m hardly breathing</i>

113
00:07:34,546 --> 00:07:38,759
<i>He</i>'<i>s such a tall, dark, strong</i>
<i>and handsome brute</i>

114
00:07:38,884 --> 00:07:40,427
-Bonjour
-<i>Good day</i>

115
00:07:40,552 --> 00:07:42,346
-<i>You call this bacon?</i>
-<i>What lovely grapes</i>

116
00:07:42,471 --> 00:07:43,597
-<i>Some cheese</i>
-<i>Ten yards</i>

117
00:07:43,722 --> 00:07:45,015
-<i>Excuse me</i>
-<i>I</i>'<i>ll get the knife</i>

118
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,976
-<i>Please let me through</i>
-<i>This bread, it</i>'<i>s stale</i>

119
00:07:47,101 --> 00:07:49,269
-<i>Those fish, they smell</i>
-Madame's <i>mistaken</i>

120
00:07:49,395 --> 00:07:52,940
<i>There must be more</i>
<i>than this provincial life</i>

121
00:07:53,065 --> 00:07:57,236
<i>Just watch, I</i>'<i>m going</i>
<i>to make Belle my wife</i>

122
00:07:57,361 --> 00:08:00,781
<i>Look, there she goes</i>
<i>a girl who</i>'<i>s strange but special</i>

123
00:08:00,906 --> 00:08:03,993
<i>A most peculiar</i> mademoiselle

124
00:08:04,118 --> 00:08:05,786
<i>It</i>'<i>s a pity and a sin</i>

125
00:08:05,911 --> 00:08:07,579
<i>She doesn</i>'<i>t quite fit in</i>

126
00:08:07,705 --> 00:08:09,623
'<i>Cause she really is a funny girl</i>

127
00:08:09,748 --> 00:08:11,417
<i>A beauty but a funny girl</i>

128
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:16,422
<i>She really is a funny girl</i>

129
00:08:16,547 --> 00:08:20,634
<i>That Belle</i>

130
00:08:25,764 --> 00:08:28,684
-Hello, Belle.
-<i>Bonjour</i>, Gaston.

131
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:30,769
Gaston, may I have my book, please?

132
00:08:30,894 --> 00:08:33,397
How can you read this?
There's no pictures.

133
00:08:33,522 --> 00:08:35,774
Well, some people
use their imagination.

134
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:38,694
Belle, it's about time you got
your head out of those books

135
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:41,322
and paid attention
to more important things.

136
00:08:41,447 --> 00:08:42,656
Like me.

137
00:08:44,366 --> 00:08:46,744
The whole town's talking about it.

138
00:08:46,869 --> 00:08:48,662
It's not right for a woman to read.

139
00:08:48,787 --> 00:08:51,332
Soon she starts getting ideas
and thinking.

140
00:08:51,457 --> 00:08:53,751
Gaston, you are positively primeval.

141
00:08:53,876 --> 00:08:55,753
Why, thank you, Belle.

142
00:08:55,878 --> 00:08:58,088
What do you say you and me
take a walk over to the tavern

143
00:08:58,213 --> 00:09:01,342
-and take a look at my trophies?
-Maybe some other time.

144
00:09:01,467 --> 00:09:03,177
-What's wrong with her?
-She's crazy.

145
00:09:03,302 --> 00:09:04,678
He's gorgeous.

146
00:09:04,803 --> 00:09:08,390
Please, Gaston, I can't.\I  have to get home to help my father.

147
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:10,059
Goodbye.

148
00:09:10,184 --> 00:09:13,896
That crazy old loon.
He needs all the help he can get.

149
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:15,773
Don't talk about my father that way.

150
00:09:15,898 --> 00:09:18,359
Yeah! Don't talk
about her father that way.

151
00:09:18,484 --> 00:09:21,028
My father is not crazy. He's a genius.

152
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,670
-Papa?
-How on earth did that happen?

153
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:41,965
-Doggone it!
-Are you all right, Papa?

154
00:09:42,091 --> 00:09:45,594
I'm... I'm about ready
to give up on this hunk of junk.

155
00:09:46,762 --> 00:09:49,515
-You always say that.
-l mean it this time!

156
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,476
I'll never get this
boneheaded contraption to work!

157
00:09:52,601 --> 00:09:56,480
Yes, you will. And you'll win first prize
at the fair tomorrow.

158
00:09:56,605 --> 00:09:59,942
And become a world-famous inventor.

159
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:02,069
You really believe that?

160
00:10:02,194 --> 00:10:03,946
I always have.

161
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:08,242
Well, what are we waiting for?
I'll have this thing fixed in no time.

162
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:11,537
Hand me that...
The dog-legged clincher there.

163
00:10:11,662 --> 00:10:14,456
So, did you have a good time
in town today?

164
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:16,792
I got a new book.

165
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:19,753
Papa, do you think I'm odd?

166
00:10:19,878 --> 00:10:22,256
My daughter? Odd?

167
00:10:22,381 --> 00:10:24,258
Where would you get an idea like that?

168
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:28,554
I don't know.
It's just that I'm not sure I fit in here.

169
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:30,514
There's no one I can really talk to.

170
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:34,059
What about that Gaston?
He's a handsome fella.

171
00:10:34,184 --> 00:10:38,188
He's handsome, all right,
and rude and conceited and...

172
00:10:38,314 --> 00:10:39,940
Papa, he's not for me.

173
00:10:40,065 --> 00:10:42,109
Well, don't you worry.

174
00:10:42,234 --> 00:10:45,863
'Cause this invention's gonna be
the start of a new life for us.

175
00:10:45,988 --> 00:10:49,116
I think that's done it.
Now, let's give it a try.

176
00:11:03,422 --> 00:11:05,591
-It works!
-It does?

177
00:11:07,051 --> 00:11:08,969
-It does!
-You did it.

178
00:11:09,094 --> 00:11:11,013
You really did it!

179
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:14,099
Hitch up Philippe, girl. I'm off to the fair!

180
00:11:16,518 --> 00:11:18,354
Goodbye, Papa. Good luck.

181
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:21,357
Goodbye, Belle.
Take care while I'm gone.

182
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,794
We should be there by now.

183
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:44,088
Maybe we missed a turn.

184
00:11:44,213 --> 00:11:47,299
I guess I should've taken...
Wait a minute.

185
00:11:51,887 --> 00:11:53,681
No. Let's go this way.

186
00:12:04,566 --> 00:12:08,529
Come on, Philippe, it's a shortcut.
We'll be there in no time.

187
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:31,677
This can't be right.
Where have you taken us, Philippe?

188
00:12:31,802 --> 00:12:33,887
We better turn around.

189
00:12:35,806 --> 00:12:39,643
Whoa. Whoa, boy.
Whoa, now, whoa, Philippe.

190
00:12:43,397 --> 00:12:44,815
Look out! No!

191
00:12:47,985 --> 00:12:49,028
Whoa!

192
00:12:49,778 --> 00:12:51,071
Whoa, boy!

193
00:12:52,781 --> 00:12:54,783
Back up, back up, back up!

194
00:12:55,659 --> 00:12:58,912
Good boy. Good boy.
That's good, that's... Back up!

195
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:01,623
Steady, steady, now. Steady.

196
00:13:02,124 --> 00:13:04,668
Steady. No, Philippe!

197
00:13:12,217 --> 00:13:13,427
Philippe?

198
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:42,122
Help! Is... Is someone there?

199
00:13:43,165 --> 00:13:44,249
Help!

200
00:14:20,369 --> 00:14:21,495
Hello?

201
00:14:24,581 --> 00:14:25,958
Hello!

202
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,335
Poor fellow must have lost his way
in the woods.

203
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:31,839
Keep quiet. Maybe he'll go away.

204
00:14:31,964 --> 00:14:33,841
Is someone there?

205
00:14:34,842 --> 00:14:37,386
Not a word, Lumiere. Not one word.

206
00:14:37,511 --> 00:14:41,682
I don't mean to intrude,
but I've lost my horse

207
00:14:41,807 --> 00:14:44,518
and I need a place to stay for the night.

208
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:47,104
Cogsworth, have a heart.

209
00:14:50,607 --> 00:14:52,943
Of course, <i>monsieur</i>,
you are welcome here.

210
00:14:53,068 --> 00:14:54,987
Who said that?

211
00:14:55,112 --> 00:14:56,613
Over here.

212
00:14:56,739 --> 00:14:58,782
-Where?
-Hello.

213
00:15:02,494 --> 00:15:04,038
Incredible!

214
00:15:04,163 --> 00:15:05,873
Well, now you've done it, Lumiere.

215
00:15:05,998 --> 00:15:08,208
Splendid. Just peachy.

216
00:15:09,043 --> 00:15:12,338
-How is this accomplished?
-Put me down at once.

217
00:15:12,463 --> 00:15:14,548
Stop that! Stop that, I say!

218
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,682
Sir, close that at once!

219
00:15:23,807 --> 00:15:26,226
-Do you mind?
-l beg your pardon.

220
00:15:26,352 --> 00:15:29,730
It's... It's just
that I've never seen a clock that...

221
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:40,491
You are soaked to the bone, <i>monsieur</i>.

222
00:15:40,616 --> 00:15:42,534
Come. Warm yourself by the fire.

223
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,829
-Thank you.
-No, no, no!

224
00:15:45,954 --> 00:15:47,956
You know what the master will do
if he finds him here.

225
00:15:48,082 --> 00:15:50,542
I demand that you stop right there.

226
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:55,089
No, no. Not the master's chair.

227
00:15:57,424 --> 00:15:59,885
I'm not seeing this. I'm not seeing this.

228
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:02,721
Well, hello there, boy.

229
00:16:08,727 --> 00:16:10,229
-What service.
-All right.

230
00:16:10,354 --> 00:16:13,399
This has gone far enough.
I'm in charge here...

231
00:16:13,816 --> 00:16:17,736
How would you like a nice spot of tea,
sir? It'll warm you up in no time.

232
00:16:17,861 --> 00:16:21,073
No. No tea. No tea!

233
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,911
His mustache tickles, Mama.

234
00:16:27,871 --> 00:16:28,998
Hello.

235
00:16:44,305 --> 00:16:46,098
There's a stranger here.

236
00:16:46,223 --> 00:16:49,435
Master, allow me to explain.
The gentleman was lost in the woods.

237
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,520
He was cold and wet, so...

238
00:16:54,064 --> 00:16:57,318
Master, I'd like to take this moment
to say

239
00:16:57,443 --> 00:16:59,570
I was against this from the start.
It was all his fault.

240
00:16:59,695 --> 00:17:03,157
I tried to stop them.
Would they listen to me? No, no...

241
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:10,247
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

242
00:17:10,372 --> 00:17:12,499
l... l... I was lost in the woods and...

243
00:17:12,624 --> 00:17:14,418
You are not welcome here!

244
00:17:14,543 --> 00:17:16,128
l... I'm... I'm sorry.

245
00:17:16,253 --> 00:17:19,131
-What are you staring at?
-Nothing.

246
00:17:19,256 --> 00:17:22,635
So, you've come to stare
at the Beast, have you?

247
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,305
Please, I meant no harm!\I  just needed a place to stay.

248
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:31,143
-I'll give you a place to stay!
-No, no, please! No! No!

249
00:17:36,315 --> 00:17:40,569
Oh, boy. Belle's gonna get
the surprise of her life, huh, Gaston?

250
00:17:40,694 --> 00:17:42,863
Yep, this is her lucky day.

251
00:17:46,283 --> 00:17:49,703
I'd like to thank you all
for coming to my wedding.

252
00:17:49,828 --> 00:17:53,082
First, I better go in there
and propose to the girl.

253
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:58,337
And you, LeFou, now,
when Belle and I come out that door...

254
00:17:58,462 --> 00:18:01,006
I know. I know. I strike up the band!

255
00:18:04,718 --> 00:18:06,637
-Not yet.
-Sorry.

256
00:18:19,024 --> 00:18:21,902
Gaston, what a pleasant surprise.

257
00:18:22,027 --> 00:18:25,280
Isn't it, though?
I'm just full of surprises.

258
00:18:25,406 --> 00:18:27,199
You know, Belle,
there's not a girl in town

259
00:18:27,324 --> 00:18:29,868
who wouldn't love to be in your shoes.

260
00:18:29,994 --> 00:18:31,578
This is the day...

261
00:18:34,707 --> 00:18:37,042
This is the day your dreams come true.

262
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:39,878
What do you know
about my dreams, Gaston?

263
00:18:40,004 --> 00:18:42,715
Plenty! Here. Picture this.

264
00:18:43,757 --> 00:18:48,595
A rustic hunting lodge,
my latest kill roasting on the fire

265
00:18:48,721 --> 00:18:52,099
and my little wife massaging my feet

266
00:18:52,224 --> 00:18:54,560
while the little ones play on the floor
with the dogs.

267
00:18:54,685 --> 00:18:56,979
-We'll have six or seven.
-Dogs?

268
00:18:57,104 --> 00:18:58,605
No, Belle.

269
00:18:58,731 --> 00:19:01,442
-Strapping boys like me.
-Imagine that.

270
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:02,860
Do you know who that little wife will be?

271
00:19:02,985 --> 00:19:04,903
-Let me think.
-You, Belle.

272
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:08,782
Gaston, I'm... I'm speechless.

273
00:19:09,158 --> 00:19:11,285
I really don't know what to say.

274
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:14,747
-Say you'll marry me.
-I'm very sorry, Gaston, but...

275
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:18,542
But I just don't deserve you!

276
00:19:33,641 --> 00:19:35,184
So, how'd it go?

277
00:19:36,393 --> 00:19:39,271
I'll have Belle for my wife.

278
00:19:39,396 --> 00:19:42,107
Make no mistake about that.

279
00:19:43,817 --> 00:19:44,985
Touchy.

280
00:19:52,368 --> 00:19:53,702
Is he gone?

281
00:19:55,704 --> 00:19:58,791
Can you imagine?
He asked me to marry him.

282
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:02,711
Me, the wife of that boorish, brainless...

283
00:20:03,253 --> 00:20:05,130
Madame <i>Gaston</i>

284
00:20:05,255 --> 00:20:07,049
<i>Can</i>'<i>t you just see it?</i>

285
00:20:07,174 --> 00:20:09,093
Madame <i>Gaston</i>

286
00:20:09,218 --> 00:20:10,928
<i>His little wife</i>

287
00:20:11,053 --> 00:20:14,473
<i>No, sir, not me, I guarantee it</i>

288
00:20:14,598 --> 00:20:19,103
<i>I want much more</i>
<i>than this provincial life</i>

289
00:20:28,112 --> 00:20:33,117
<i>I want adventure</i>
<i>in the great wide somewhere</i>

290
00:20:33,242 --> 00:20:36,996
<i>I want it more than I can tell</i>

291
00:20:37,955 --> 00:20:41,000
<i>And for once it might be grand</i>

292
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:44,712
<i>To have someone understand</i>

293
00:20:45,546 --> 00:20:52,344
<i>I want so much more</i>
<i>than they</i>'<i>ve got planned</i>

294
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:59,184
Philippe! What are you doing here?
Where's... Where's Papa?

295
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,937
Where is he, Philippe?
What happened?

296
00:21:02,062 --> 00:21:05,107
We have to find him.
You have to take me to him.

297
00:21:18,829 --> 00:21:20,539
What is this place?

298
00:21:22,082 --> 00:21:24,043
Philippe, please, steady.

299
00:21:26,086 --> 00:21:27,254
Steady.

300
00:21:31,091 --> 00:21:32,134
Papa!

301
00:21:33,218 --> 00:21:35,512
Couldn't keep quiet, could we?

302
00:21:35,638 --> 00:21:38,057
Just had to invite him to stay,
didn't we?

303
00:21:38,182 --> 00:21:42,519
Serve him tea, sit in the master's chair.
Pet the pooch.

304
00:21:42,645 --> 00:21:44,229
I was trying to be hospitable.

305
00:21:45,731 --> 00:21:46,857
Hello?

306
00:21:47,608 --> 00:21:49,068
Is anyone here?

307
00:21:50,027 --> 00:21:51,153
Hello?

308
00:21:52,529 --> 00:21:55,407
Papa? Papa?

309
00:21:56,408 --> 00:21:57,826
Are you here?

310
00:21:58,494 --> 00:22:01,163
Mama, there's a girl in the castle.

311
00:22:01,288 --> 00:22:04,249
Now, Chip, I'll not have you
making up such wild stories.

312
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,460
Really, Mama. I saw her.

313
00:22:06,585 --> 00:22:08,796
-Not another word. Into the tub.
-But... What?

314
00:22:08,921 --> 00:22:11,924
A girl. I saw a girl in the castle.

315
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:14,176
See, I told you.

316
00:22:14,635 --> 00:22:18,764
Irresponsible, devil-may-care,
waxy-eared, slack-jawed...

317
00:22:18,889 --> 00:22:19,932
Papa?

318
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,185
Did you see that?

319
00:22:25,145 --> 00:22:28,273
-It's a girl!
-l know it's a girl.

320
00:22:28,399 --> 00:22:31,527
Don't you see? She's the one.
The girl we have been waiting for.

321
00:22:31,652 --> 00:22:34,321
-She has come to break the spell.
-Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

322
00:22:38,283 --> 00:22:39,326
Papa?

323
00:22:40,995 --> 00:22:42,079
Papa?

324
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,667
Hello? Is someone here?

325
00:22:47,501 --> 00:22:50,087
Wait! I'm looking for my father. l...

326
00:22:53,674 --> 00:22:56,343
That's funny.
I'm sure there was someone.

327
00:22:58,512 --> 00:22:59,972
Is anyone here?

328
00:23:00,597 --> 00:23:02,474
-Belle?
-Papa!

329
00:23:05,144 --> 00:23:06,520
How did you find me?

330
00:23:06,645 --> 00:23:09,440
Your hands are like ice.
We have to get you out of there.

331
00:23:09,565 --> 00:23:11,483
Belle, I want you to leave this place.

332
00:23:11,608 --> 00:23:12,693
Who's done this to you?

333
00:23:12,818 --> 00:23:15,279
No time to explain. You must go. Now!

334
00:23:15,404 --> 00:23:17,656
-I won't leave you.
-What are you doing here?

335
00:23:17,781 --> 00:23:18,949
Run, Belle!

336
00:23:19,074 --> 00:23:22,494
-Who's there? Who are you?
-The master of this castle.

337
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,164
I've come for my father.

338
00:23:25,289 --> 00:23:27,499
Please let him out.
Can't you see he's sick?

339
00:23:27,624 --> 00:23:29,835
Then he shouldn't
have trespassed here!

340
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,546
But he could die.
Please, I'll do anything.

341
00:23:32,671 --> 00:23:36,425
There's nothing you can do.
He's my prisoner.

342
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,802
There must be some way I can...

343
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,804
Wait!

344
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,729
-Take me instead.
-You?

345
00:23:50,606 --> 00:23:53,609
You would take his place?

346
00:23:53,734 --> 00:23:55,903
Belle, no!
You don't know what you're doing!

347
00:23:56,028 --> 00:23:58,989
If I did, would you let him go?

348
00:23:59,114 --> 00:24:03,577
Yes. But you must promise
to stay here forever.

349
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,831
Come into the light.

350
00:24:19,593 --> 00:24:22,388
No, Belle! I won't let you do this!

351
00:24:25,432 --> 00:24:27,476
-You have my word.
-Done.

352
00:24:31,772 --> 00:24:34,942
No, Belle, listen to me.
I'm old. I've lived my life.

353
00:24:35,067 --> 00:24:36,110
Wait.

354
00:24:36,235 --> 00:24:37,236
-Belle!
-Wait.

355
00:24:38,821 --> 00:24:41,532
No! Please spare my daughter. Please!

356
00:24:41,657 --> 00:24:44,910
She's no longer your concern.
Take him to the village.

357
00:24:45,035 --> 00:24:47,788
Let me out. Please let me out!

358
00:24:47,913 --> 00:24:52,001
Let me out! Please! Please!

359
00:24:57,881 --> 00:24:59,341
-Master?
-What?

360
00:25:00,092 --> 00:25:03,220
Since the girl is going to be with us
for quite some time,

361
00:25:03,345 --> 00:25:07,975
I was thinking that you might want
to offer her a more comfortable room.

362
00:25:09,977 --> 00:25:11,270
Then again, maybe not.

363
00:25:14,064 --> 00:25:16,275
You didn't even let me say goodbye.

364
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,360
I'll never see him again.

365
00:25:18,986 --> 00:25:21,071
I didn't get to say goodbye.

366
00:25:22,406 --> 00:25:24,283
I'll show you to your room.

367
00:25:24,408 --> 00:25:26,910
My room? But I thought...

368
00:25:27,661 --> 00:25:29,288
You wanna...
You wanna stay in the tower?

369
00:25:29,413 --> 00:25:30,748
-No.
-Then follow me.

370
00:25:52,269 --> 00:25:54,063
Say something to her.

371
00:25:55,939 --> 00:25:58,984
I hope you like it here.

372
00:26:01,654 --> 00:26:02,738
The castle is your home now,

373
00:26:02,863 --> 00:26:05,783
so you can go anywhere you like,
except the west wing.

374
00:26:05,908 --> 00:26:08,494
-What's in the west...
-It's forbidden!

375
00:26:15,584 --> 00:26:18,962
Now, if you need anything,
my servants will attend you.

376
00:26:19,088 --> 00:26:21,215
Dinner. Invite her to dinner.

377
00:26:21,715 --> 00:26:25,469
You will join me for dinner.
That's not a request!

378
00:26:44,071 --> 00:26:45,948
Who does she think she is?

379
00:26:46,073 --> 00:26:48,200
That girl has tangled
with the wrong man.

380
00:26:48,325 --> 00:26:51,328
-No one says no to Gaston.
-Darn right.

381
00:26:51,453 --> 00:26:55,708
Dismissed. Rejected.
Publicly humiliated.

382
00:26:55,833 --> 00:26:57,710
Why, it's more than I can bear.

383
00:26:57,835 --> 00:27:01,213
-More beer?
-What for? Nothing helps.

384
00:27:01,338 --> 00:27:04,341
-I'm disgraced.
-Who, you? Never.

385
00:27:04,925 --> 00:27:08,554
Gaston, you've got
to pull yourself together.

386
00:27:09,013 --> 00:27:12,057
<i>Gosh, it disturbs me</i>
<i>to see you, Gaston</i>

387
00:27:12,182 --> 00:27:15,269
<i>Looking so down in the dumps</i>

388
00:27:15,394 --> 00:27:18,564
<i>Every guy here</i>'<i>d</i>
<i>love to be you, Gaston</i>

389
00:27:18,689 --> 00:27:21,608
<i>Even when taking your lumps</i>

390
00:27:21,734 --> 00:27:24,737
<i>There</i>'<i>s no man in town</i>
<i>as admired as you</i>

391
00:27:24,862 --> 00:27:28,324
<i>You</i>'<i>re everyone</i>'<i>s favorite guy</i>

392
00:27:28,449 --> 00:27:31,660
<i>Everyone</i>'<i>s awed</i>
<i>and inspired by you</i>

393
00:27:31,785 --> 00:27:34,788
<i>And it</i>'<i>s not very hard</i>

394
00:27:34,913 --> 00:27:38,709
<i>To see why</i>

395
00:27:40,461 --> 00:27:45,007
<i>No one</i>'<i>s slick as Gaston</i>

396
00:27:45,132 --> 00:27:46,592
<i>No one</i>'<i>s quick as Gaston</i>

397
00:27:46,717 --> 00:27:49,928
<i>No one</i>'<i>s neck</i>'<i>s</i>
<i>as incredibly thick as Gaston</i>

398
00:27:50,054 --> 00:27:53,641
<i>For there</i>'<i>s no man in town</i>
<i>half as manly</i>

399
00:27:53,766 --> 00:27:56,435
<i>Perfect, a pure paragon</i>

400
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,772
<i>You can ask any</i>
<i>Tom, Dick or Stanley</i>

401
00:27:59,897 --> 00:28:05,235
<i>And they</i>'<i>ll tell you</i>
<i>whose team they prefer to be on</i>

402
00:28:05,361 --> 00:28:09,531
<i>No one</i>'<i>s been like Gaston</i>

403
00:28:09,657 --> 00:28:11,200
<i>A kingpin like Gaston</i>

404
00:28:11,325 --> 00:28:14,495
<i>No one</i>'<i>s got a swell cleft</i>
<i>in his chin like Gaston</i>

405
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:18,415
<i>As a specimen, yes, I</i>'<i>m intimidating</i>

406
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:21,460
<i>My, what a guy, that Gaston</i>

407
00:28:21,585 --> 00:28:24,838
<i>Give five hurrays</i>
<i>Give 1 2 hip-hips</i>

408
00:28:24,963 --> 00:28:29,468
<i>Gaston is the best</i>
<i>and the rest is all drips</i>

409
00:28:30,302 --> 00:28:34,640
<i>No one fights like Gaston</i>

410
00:28:34,765 --> 00:28:36,350
<i>Douses lights like Gaston</i>

411
00:28:36,475 --> 00:28:39,645
<i>In a wrestling match</i>
<i>nobody bites like Gaston</i>

412
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:43,065
<i>For there</i>'<i>s no one</i>
<i>as burly and brawny</i>

413
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:46,318
<i>As you see, I</i>'<i>ve got biceps to spare</i>

414
00:28:46,443 --> 00:28:50,155
-<i>Not a bit of him scraggly or scrawny</i>
-<i>That</i>'<i>s right</i>

415
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,158
<i>And every last inch of me</i>'<i>s</i>
<i>covered with hair</i>

416
00:28:53,283 --> 00:28:56,412
-<i>No one hits like Gaston</i>
-<i>Matches wits like Gaston</i>

417
00:28:56,537 --> 00:28:59,873
<i>In a spitting match</i>
<i>nobody spits like Gaston</i>

418
00:28:59,999 --> 00:29:03,711
<i>I</i>'<i>m especially good at expectorating</i>

419
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,839
<i>Ten points for Gaston</i>

420
00:29:06,964 --> 00:29:09,883
<i>When I was a lad</i>
<i>I ate four dozen eggs</i>

421
00:29:10,009 --> 00:29:13,470
<i>Every morning to help me get large</i>

422
00:29:13,595 --> 00:29:16,557
<i>And now that I</i>'<i>m grown</i>
<i>I eat five dozen eggs</i>

423
00:29:16,682 --> 00:29:22,646
<i>So I</i>'<i>m roughly the size of a barge</i>

424
00:29:22,771 --> 00:29:27,526
<i>No one shoots like Gaston</i>

425
00:29:27,651 --> 00:29:29,194
<i>Makes those beauts like Gaston</i>

426
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,531
<i>Then goes tromping around</i>
<i>wearing boots like Gaston</i>

427
00:29:32,656 --> 00:29:36,535
<i>I use antlers in all of my decorating</i>

428
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:39,079
<i>My, what a guy</i>

429
00:29:39,204 --> 00:29:45,085
<i>Gaston</i>

430
00:29:49,631 --> 00:29:52,051
-Help! Someone help me!
-Maurice?

431
00:29:52,176 --> 00:29:54,345
Please! Please, I need your help.

432
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:57,056
He's got her...
He's got her locked in the dungeon.

433
00:29:57,181 --> 00:29:59,183
-Who?
-Belle. We must go.

434
00:29:59,308 --> 00:30:01,060
Not... Not a minute to lose.

435
00:30:01,185 --> 00:30:03,437
Whoa! Slow down, Maurice.

436
00:30:03,562 --> 00:30:06,315
-Who's got Belle locked in a dungeon?
-A beast!

437
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,026
A horrible, monstrous beast!

438
00:30:14,657 --> 00:30:16,408
-Is it a big beast?
-Huge.

439
00:30:16,533 --> 00:30:19,411
-With a long, ugly snout?
-Hideously ugly.

440
00:30:19,536 --> 00:30:22,956
-And sharp, cruel fangs?
-Yes, yes! Will you help me?

441
00:30:23,082 --> 00:30:25,751
All right, old man. We'll help you out.

442
00:30:25,876 --> 00:30:29,588
You will?
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

443
00:30:31,924 --> 00:30:34,218
Crazy old Maurice.

444
00:30:34,343 --> 00:30:37,096
He's always good for a laugh.

445
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,432
Crazy old Maurice?

446
00:30:41,976 --> 00:30:44,311
Crazy old Maurice.

447
00:30:45,729 --> 00:30:49,024
<i>LeFou, I</i>'<i>m afraid I</i>'<i>ve been thinking</i>

448
00:30:49,149 --> 00:30:50,693
<i>A dangerous pastime</i>

449
00:30:50,818 --> 00:30:51,944
<i>I know</i>

450
00:30:52,069 --> 00:30:55,280
<i>But that wacky old coot</i>
<i>is Belle</i>'<i>s father</i>

451
00:30:55,406 --> 00:30:58,492
<i>And his sanity</i>'<i>s only so-so</i>

452
00:30:58,617 --> 00:31:01,829
<i>Now, the wheels in my head</i>
<i>have been turning</i>

453
00:31:01,954 --> 00:31:05,040
<i>Since I looked at that loony old man</i>

454
00:31:05,165 --> 00:31:08,544
<i>See, I promised myself</i>
<i>I</i>'<i>d be married to Belle</i>

455
00:31:08,669 --> 00:31:13,132
<i>And right now, I</i>'<i>m evolving a plan</i>

456
00:31:13,257 --> 00:31:15,342
-If l...
-Yes?

457
00:31:15,467 --> 00:31:18,470
-Then we...
-No, would she?

458
00:31:18,595 --> 00:31:20,139
-Guess.
-Now I get it!

459
00:31:20,264 --> 00:31:22,474
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

460
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:26,603
<i>No one plots like Gaston</i>

461
00:31:26,729 --> 00:31:28,314
<i>Takes cheap shots like Gaston</i>

462
00:31:28,439 --> 00:31:31,650
<i>Plans to persecute harmless crackpots</i>
<i>like Gaston</i>

463
00:31:31,775 --> 00:31:37,323
<i>So, his marriage</i>
<i>we soon will be celebrating</i>

464
00:31:37,448 --> 00:31:39,950
<i>My, what a guy</i>

465
00:31:40,075 --> 00:31:44,246
<i>Gaston</i>

466
00:31:47,499 --> 00:31:50,085
Will no one help me?

467
00:31:58,886 --> 00:32:01,055
-Who is it?
-Mrs Potts, dear.

468
00:32:03,182 --> 00:32:05,100
I thought you might like a spot of tea.

469
00:32:05,225 --> 00:32:07,186
But you're... You're a...

470
00:32:09,021 --> 00:32:11,190
-Careful.
-This is impossible.

471
00:32:11,315 --> 00:32:13,901
I know it is, but here we are.

472
00:32:14,026 --> 00:32:16,820
I told you she was pretty, Mama,
didn't l?

473
00:32:16,945 --> 00:32:21,200
All right, Chip, now, that'll do.
Slowly now. Don't spill.

474
00:32:22,701 --> 00:32:24,078
Thank you.

475
00:32:24,203 --> 00:32:26,121
Wanna see me do a trick?

476
00:32:27,581 --> 00:32:30,584
-Chip!
-Sorry.

477
00:32:30,709 --> 00:32:33,253
That was a very brave thing
you did, my dear.

478
00:32:33,379 --> 00:32:34,797
We all think so.

479
00:32:34,922 --> 00:32:38,384
But I've lost my father,
my dreams, everything.

480
00:32:38,509 --> 00:32:43,138
Cheer up, child.
It'll turn out all right in the end.

481
00:32:43,263 --> 00:32:44,807
You'll see.

482
00:32:44,932 --> 00:32:46,517
Listen to me jabbering on

483
00:32:46,642 --> 00:32:48,727
while there's a supper
to get on the table.

484
00:32:48,852 --> 00:32:50,604
Chip?

485
00:32:50,729 --> 00:32:52,022
Bye.

486
00:32:52,147 --> 00:32:55,234
Well, now,
what shall we dress you in for dinner?

487
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:58,237
Let's see what I got in my drawers.

488
00:32:58,362 --> 00:33:00,072
How embarrassing!

489
00:33:02,616 --> 00:33:05,911
Here we are.
You'll look ravishing in this one.

490
00:33:06,036 --> 00:33:09,415
That's very kind of you,
but I'm not going to dinner.

491
00:33:10,124 --> 00:33:11,542
But you must.

492
00:33:14,753 --> 00:33:17,172
Dinner is served.

493
00:33:19,466 --> 00:33:21,343
What's taking so long?

494
00:33:21,468 --> 00:33:23,178
I told her to come down.

495
00:33:23,304 --> 00:33:26,765
-Why isn't she here yet?
-Try to be patient, sir.

496
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:30,144
The girl has lost her father
and her freedom all in one day.

497
00:33:30,269 --> 00:33:31,729
Master, have you thought

498
00:33:31,854 --> 00:33:34,606
that perhaps this girl could be the one
to break the spell?

499
00:33:34,732 --> 00:33:37,484
Of course I have! I'm not a fool.

500
00:33:37,609 --> 00:33:40,321
Good! So, you fall in love with her,

501
00:33:40,446 --> 00:33:44,033
she falls in love with you, and poof!
The spell is broken.

502
00:33:44,158 --> 00:33:46,327
We'll be human again by midnight.

503
00:33:46,452 --> 00:33:48,912
It's not that easy, Lumiere.
These things take time.

504
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:51,623
But the rose has already begun to wilt.

505
00:33:51,749 --> 00:33:53,584
It's no use.

506
00:33:53,709 --> 00:33:56,086
She's so beautiful and I'm...

507
00:33:56,211 --> 00:33:57,796
Well, look at me!

508
00:33:59,923 --> 00:34:02,885
You must help her to see past all that.

509
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:04,720
I don't know how.

510
00:34:04,845 --> 00:34:07,348
Well, you can start
by making yourself more presentable.

511
00:34:07,473 --> 00:34:09,808
Straighten up.
Try to act like a gentleman.

512
00:34:09,933 --> 00:34:13,812
Yes. When she comes in,
give her a dashing, debonair smile.

513
00:34:13,937 --> 00:34:16,190
Come, come, show me the smile.

514
00:34:16,315 --> 00:34:20,235
-But don't frighten the poor girl.
-Impress her with your rapier wit.

515
00:34:20,361 --> 00:34:21,487
But be gentle.

516
00:34:21,612 --> 00:34:23,822
-Shower her with compliments.
-But be sincere.

517
00:34:23,947 --> 00:34:25,366
And above all,

518
00:34:25,491 --> 00:34:28,452
-you must control your temper!
-You must control your temper!

519
00:34:28,577 --> 00:34:29,912
Here she is!

520
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:33,457
Good evening.

521
00:34:34,416 --> 00:34:37,211
-Well, where is she?
-Who?

522
00:34:38,712 --> 00:34:41,006
The girl, yes. The girl.

523
00:34:41,131 --> 00:34:45,010
Well, actually, she's in the process of...

524
00:34:45,135 --> 00:34:49,515
Circumstances being what they are...
She's not coming.

525
00:34:50,641 --> 00:34:51,684
What?

526
00:34:52,393 --> 00:34:54,853
Oh, dear. Your Grace! Your Eminence!

527
00:34:55,646 --> 00:34:57,356
Let's not be hasty!

528
00:35:00,401 --> 00:35:02,069
I thought I told you
to come down to dinner!

529
00:35:02,194 --> 00:35:03,696
I'm not hungry.

530
00:35:04,238 --> 00:35:07,533
You'll come out or I'll... I'll...
I'll break down the door!

531
00:35:07,658 --> 00:35:09,451
Master, I could be wrong,

532
00:35:09,576 --> 00:35:14,039
but that may not be the best way
to win the girl's affections.

533
00:35:14,164 --> 00:35:17,543
Please attempt to be a gentleman.

534
00:35:17,668 --> 00:35:20,337
But she is being so difficult.

535
00:35:20,462 --> 00:35:22,756
Gently, gently.

536
00:35:24,842 --> 00:35:27,219
-Will you come down to dinner?
-No!

537
00:35:28,554 --> 00:35:30,848
Suave, genteel.

538
00:35:30,973 --> 00:35:33,892
It would give me great pleasure

539
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:36,770
if you would join me for dinner.

540
00:35:36,895 --> 00:35:38,564
And we say ''please.''

541
00:35:38,939 --> 00:35:40,399
-Please.
-No, thank you.

542
00:35:40,524 --> 00:35:42,735
-You can't stay in there forever!
-Yes, I can.

543
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:47,323
Fine! Then go ahead and starve!

544
00:35:47,448 --> 00:35:52,036
If she doesn't eat with me,
then she doesn't eat at all!

545
00:35:55,497 --> 00:35:58,500
Oh, dear.
That didn't go very well at all, did it?

546
00:35:58,625 --> 00:36:01,420
Lumiere, stand watch at the door

547
00:36:01,545 --> 00:36:04,798
and inform me at once
if there is the slightest change.

548
00:36:04,923 --> 00:36:07,384
You can count on me, <i>mon capitaine</i>.

549
00:36:07,509 --> 00:36:11,639
Well, we might as well go downstairs
and start cleaning up.

550
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,309
I ask nicely, but she refuses.

551
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:18,437
What does she want me to do, beg?

552
00:36:19,688 --> 00:36:21,273
Show me the girl.

553
00:36:23,442 --> 00:36:27,112
<i>But the master</i>'<i>s really not so bad</i>,
<i>once you get to know him</i>.

554
00:36:27,237 --> 00:36:29,198
<i>Why don</i>'<i>t you give him a chance?</i>

555
00:36:29,323 --> 00:36:31,075
<i>I don</i>'<i>t want to get to know him</i>.

556
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,078
<i>I don</i>'<i>t want to have anything</i>
<i>to do with him</i>.

557
00:36:35,913 --> 00:36:37,790
I'm just fooling myself.

558
00:36:37,915 --> 00:36:40,793
She'll never see me as anything

559
00:36:40,918 --> 00:36:42,336
but a monster.

560
00:36:47,675 --> 00:36:49,134
It's hopeless.

561
00:37:07,069 --> 00:37:08,862
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yes.

562
00:37:08,988 --> 00:37:11,615
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yes, yes, yes.

563
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:14,159
I've been burned by you before.

564
00:37:17,329 --> 00:37:19,373
<i>Zut alors!</i> She has emerged!

565
00:37:24,044 --> 00:37:27,965
Come on, Chip. Into the cupboard
with your brothers and sisters.

566
00:37:29,091 --> 00:37:30,718
But I'm not sleepy.

567
00:37:30,843 --> 00:37:33,887
-Yes, you are.
-No, I'm not.

568
00:37:34,013 --> 00:37:37,516
I work and I slave all day long,
and for what?

569
00:37:37,641 --> 00:37:40,519
A culinary masterpiece gone to waste!

570
00:37:40,644 --> 00:37:43,605
Stop your grousing.
It's been a long night for all of us.

571
00:37:43,731 --> 00:37:46,859
Well, if you ask me,
she was just being stubborn.

572
00:37:46,984 --> 00:37:48,527
After all, he did say ''please.''

573
00:37:48,652 --> 00:37:51,363
But if the master doesn't learn
to control that temper,

574
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,699
-he'll never break the...
-Splendid to see you

575
00:37:53,824 --> 00:37:55,409
out and about, <i>mademoiselle</i>.

576
00:37:55,534 --> 00:37:58,120
I am Cogsworth, head of the household.

577
00:38:00,622 --> 00:38:03,584
-This is Lumiere.
-<i>Enchanté, chérie</i>.

578
00:38:03,709 --> 00:38:06,879
If there's, stop that,
anything we, please,

579
00:38:07,004 --> 00:38:10,132
can do to make your stay
more comfortable...

580
00:38:10,257 --> 00:38:12,551
-I am a little hungry.
-You are?

581
00:38:12,676 --> 00:38:14,386
Hear that? She's hungry.

582
00:38:14,511 --> 00:38:17,556
Stoke the fire.
Break out the silver. Wake the china.

583
00:38:17,681 --> 00:38:20,267
Remember what the master said.

584
00:38:20,392 --> 00:38:23,395
Pish tosh. I'm not about
to let the poor child go hungry.

585
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,398
All right, fine. Glass of water,
crust of bread and then...

586
00:38:26,523 --> 00:38:28,359
Cogsworth, I am surprised at you.

587
00:38:29,068 --> 00:38:31,779
She's not a prisoner. She's our guest.

588
00:38:31,904 --> 00:38:35,449
We must make her feel welcome here.
Right this way, <i>mademoiselle</i>.

589
00:38:35,574 --> 00:38:37,368
Well, keep it down.

590
00:38:37,493 --> 00:38:39,870
If the master finds out about this,
it will be our necks.

591
00:38:39,995 --> 00:38:41,789
Of course, of course.

592
00:38:41,914 --> 00:38:44,833
But what is dinner
without a little music?

593
00:38:45,584 --> 00:38:46,710
Music?

594
00:38:50,673 --> 00:38:54,134
It is with deepest pride
and greatest pleasure

595
00:38:54,259 --> 00:38:56,053
that we welcome you tonight.

596
00:38:56,178 --> 00:38:58,764
And now, we invite you to relax.

597
00:38:58,889 --> 00:39:03,686
Let us pull up a chair,
as the dining room proudly presents

598
00:39:03,811 --> 00:39:05,145
your dinner.

599
00:39:06,647 --> 00:39:11,485
<i>Be our guest, be our guest</i>

600
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:13,779
<i>Put our service to the test</i>

601
00:39:13,904 --> 00:39:16,448
<i>Tie your napkin</i>
'<i>round your neck</i>, chérie

602
00:39:16,573 --> 00:39:18,450
<i>And we provide the rest</i>

603
00:39:18,575 --> 00:39:20,744
<i>Soup</i> du jour, <i>hot</i> hors d'oeuvres

604
00:39:20,869 --> 00:39:22,997
<i>Why, we only live to serve</i>

605
00:39:23,122 --> 00:39:25,332
<i>Try the gray stuff, it</i>'<i>s delicious</i>

606
00:39:25,457 --> 00:39:27,668
<i>Don</i>'<i>t believe me?</i>
<i>Ask the dishes</i>

607
00:39:27,793 --> 00:39:29,920
<i>They can sing, they can dance</i>

608
00:39:30,045 --> 00:39:32,423
<i>After all, miss, this is France</i>

609
00:39:32,548 --> 00:39:36,343
<i>And a dinner here</i>
<i>is never second best</i>

610
00:39:36,468 --> 00:39:38,887
<i>Go on, unfold your menu</i>

611
00:39:39,013 --> 00:39:42,099
<i>Take a glance</i>
<i>and then you</i>'<i>ll be our guest</i>

612
00:39:42,224 --> 00:39:45,352
Oui, <i>our guest</i>
<i>Be our guest</i>

613
00:39:45,477 --> 00:39:47,730
<i>Beef ragout, cheese soufflé</i>

614
00:39:47,855 --> 00:39:49,857
<i>Pie and pudding, en flambé</i>

615
00:39:49,982 --> 00:39:51,775
<i>We</i>'<i>ll prepare and serve with flair</i>

616
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,028
<i>A culinary cabaret</i>

617
00:39:54,153 --> 00:39:56,363
<i>You</i>'<i>re alone and you</i>'<i>re scared</i>

618
00:39:56,488 --> 00:39:58,449
<i>But the banquet</i>'<i>s all prepared</i>

619
00:39:58,574 --> 00:40:00,576
<i>No one</i>'<i>s gloomy or complaining</i>

620
00:40:00,701 --> 00:40:02,786
<i>While the flatware</i>'<i>s entertaining</i>

621
00:40:02,911 --> 00:40:04,788
<i>We tell jokes, I do tricks</i>

622
00:40:04,913 --> 00:40:07,041
<i>With my fellow candlesticks</i>

623
00:40:07,166 --> 00:40:08,876
Und <i>it</i>'<i>s all in perfect taste</i>

624
00:40:09,001 --> 00:40:11,045
<i>That you can bet</i>

625
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:13,213
<i>Come on and lift your glass</i>

626
00:40:13,339 --> 00:40:15,299
<i>You</i>'<i>ve won your own free pass</i>

627
00:40:15,424 --> 00:40:16,467
<i>To be our guest</i>

628
00:40:16,592 --> 00:40:19,845
<i>If you</i>'<i>re stressed</i>
<i>it</i>'<i>s fine dining we suggest</i>

629
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:22,014
<i>Be our guest, be our guest</i>

630
00:40:22,139 --> 00:40:23,891
<i>Be our guest</i>

631
00:40:25,684 --> 00:40:27,895
<i>Life is so unnerving</i>

632
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,439
<i>For a servant who</i>'<i>s not serving</i>

633
00:40:30,564 --> 00:40:33,734
<i>He</i>'<i>s not whole</i>
<i>without a soul to wait upon</i>

634
00:40:33,859 --> 00:40:35,361
Get off!

635
00:40:36,195 --> 00:40:37,446
<i>Those good old days</i>

636
00:40:37,571 --> 00:40:39,239
<i>When we were useful</i>

637
00:40:40,449 --> 00:40:44,119
<i>Suddenly, those good old days</i>
<i>are gone</i>

638
00:40:44,912 --> 00:40:47,081
<i>Ten years we</i>'<i>ve been rusting</i>

639
00:40:47,206 --> 00:40:49,750
<i>Needing so much more than dusting</i>

640
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:51,210
<i>Needing exercise</i>

641
00:40:51,335 --> 00:40:54,463
<i>A chance to use our skills</i>

642
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:59,593
<i>Most days</i>
<i>we just lay around the castle</i>

643
00:40:59,718 --> 00:41:01,303
<i>Flabby, fat and lazy</i>

644
00:41:01,428 --> 00:41:03,305
<i>You walked in and oops-a-daisy</i>

645
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:05,224
<i>It</i>'<i>s a guest, it</i>'<i>s a guest</i>

646
00:41:05,349 --> 00:41:06,976
<i>Sakes alive, well, I</i>'<i>ll be blessed</i>

647
00:41:07,101 --> 00:41:08,769
<i>Wine</i>'<i>s been poured</i>
<i>and thank the Lord</i>

648
00:41:08,894 --> 00:41:10,813
<i>I</i>'<i>ve had the napkins freshly pressed</i>

649
00:41:10,938 --> 00:41:12,815
<i>With dessert, she</i>'<i>ll want tea</i>

650
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,817
<i>And, my dear, that</i>'<i>s fine with me</i>

651
00:41:14,942 --> 00:41:16,652
<i>While the cups do their soft-shoeing</i>

652
00:41:16,777 --> 00:41:18,696
<i>I</i>'<i>ll be bubbling, I</i>'<i>ll be brewing</i>

653
00:41:18,821 --> 00:41:20,572
<i>I</i>'<i>ll get warm, piping hot</i>

654
00:41:20,698 --> 00:41:22,574
<i>Heaven sakes, is that a spot?</i>

655
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,953
<i>Clean it up</i>
<i>We want the company impressed</i>

656
00:41:26,078 --> 00:41:28,163
<i>We</i>'<i>ve got a lot to do</i>

657
00:41:28,288 --> 00:41:30,082
<i>Is it one lump or two?</i>

658
00:41:30,207 --> 00:41:31,375
<i>For you, our guest</i>

659
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,252

<i>Be our guest, be our guest</i>
<i>Our command is your request</i>

662
00:41:36,463 --> 00:41:37,798
Let's go, people. Fun's over.
Over here. Line up.

663
00:41:37,923 --> 00:41:40,634
<i>It</i>'<i>s 1 0 years</i>

<i>Yes, indeed, we aim to please</i>

667
00:41:45,848 --> 00:41:48,309
<i>While the candlelight</i>'<i>s still glowing</i>

00:41:48,434 --> 00:41:52,938
<i>Let us help you, we</i>'<i>ll keep going</i>

00:42:15,044 --> 00:42:18,547
<i>Please be our</i>

679
00:42:18,672 --> 00:42:24,345
<i>Guest</i>

680
00:42:27,222 --> 00:42:30,517
-Bravo! That was wonderful.
-Thank you.

681
00:42:31,518 --> 00:42:35,939
Thank you, <i>mademoiselle</i>.
Good show, wasn't it? Everyone!

682
00:42:36,899 --> 00:42:41,362
My goodness, look at the time.
Now it's off to bed, off to bed.

683
00:42:41,487 --> 00:42:43,864
I couldn't possibly go to bed now.

684
00:42:43,989 --> 00:42:45,866
It's my first time in an enchanted castle.

685
00:42:45,991 --> 00:42:47,284
Enchanted!

686
00:42:48,243 --> 00:42:51,372
Who said anything
about the castle being enchanted?

687
00:42:51,497 --> 00:42:53,040
It was you, wasn't it?

688
00:42:53,165 --> 00:42:55,209
I figured it out for myself.

689
00:42:57,086 --> 00:42:59,463
I'd like to look around, if that's all right.

690
00:43:00,172 --> 00:43:02,675
-Would you like a tour?
-Wait a second. Wait a second.

691
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,219
I'm not sure that's such a good idea.

692
00:43:05,344 --> 00:43:09,014
We can't let her go poking around
in certain places,

693
00:43:09,139 --> 00:43:10,557
if you know what I mean.

694
00:43:10,683 --> 00:43:12,059
Perhaps you'd like to take me.

695
00:43:12,184 --> 00:43:15,562
I'm sure you know everything there is
to know about the castle.

696
00:43:15,688 --> 00:43:18,524
Well. Actually, l...

697
00:43:18,649 --> 00:43:19,900
Yes, I do.

698
00:43:21,151 --> 00:43:24,697
As you can see,
the pseudo-facade was stripped away

699
00:43:24,822 --> 00:43:27,241
to reveal the minimalist Rococo design.

700
00:43:27,366 --> 00:43:30,035
Note the unusual
inverted vaulted ceilings.

701
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,747
This is yet another example
of the late-neoclassic Baroque period.

702
00:43:33,872 --> 00:43:37,376
And, as I always say,
if it's not Baroque, don't fix it.

703
00:43:40,087 --> 00:43:41,422
Where was l?

704
00:43:42,423 --> 00:43:43,757
As you were!

705
00:43:44,633 --> 00:43:49,263
Now, then, if I may draw your attention
to the flying buttresses above the...

706
00:43:49,388 --> 00:43:50,389
<i>Mademoiselle?</i>

707
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,897
-What's up there?
-Where? There? Nothing.

708
00:43:59,023 --> 00:44:01,066
Absolutely nothing of interest at all
in the west wing.

709
00:44:01,191 --> 00:44:03,110
Dusty, dull, very boring.

710
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,613
So, that's the west wing!

711
00:44:06,739 --> 00:44:08,073
Nice going.

712
00:44:08,741 --> 00:44:11,285
I wonder what he's hiding up there.

713
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:15,289
-Hiding? The master is hiding nothing.
-Then it wouldn't be forbidden.

714
00:44:15,414 --> 00:44:19,793
Perhaps <i>mademoiselle</i> would like
to see something else?

715
00:44:19,918 --> 00:44:22,463
We have exquisite tapestries
dating all the way back to...

716
00:44:22,588 --> 00:44:24,715
-Maybe later.
-The gardens.

717
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,967
Or... Or the... The library, perhaps?

718
00:44:27,092 --> 00:44:28,927
You have a library?

719
00:44:29,053 --> 00:44:31,055
-Yes. Indeed.
-With books.

720
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:33,599
-Scads of books.
-Mountains of books.

721
00:44:33,724 --> 00:44:35,100
-Forests of books.
-Cascades.

722
00:44:35,225 --> 00:44:36,727
-Cloudbursts.
-Swamps of books.

723
00:44:36,852 --> 00:44:39,480
More books than you'll ever be able
to read in a lifetime.

724
00:44:39,605 --> 00:44:41,649
Books on every subject ever studied

725
00:44:41,774 --> 00:44:44,485
by every author
who ever set pen to paper.

726
00:46:24,543 --> 00:46:27,921
-Why did you come here?
-I'm... I'm sorry.

727
00:46:28,047 --> 00:46:31,717
-I warned you never to come here!
-l didn't mean any harm.

728
00:46:31,842 --> 00:46:34,470
Do you realize
what you could have done?

729
00:46:35,429 --> 00:46:36,764
Please! Stop!

730
00:46:36,889 --> 00:46:39,016
-Get out!
-No!

731
00:46:41,226 --> 00:46:44,271
Get out!

732
00:46:55,699 --> 00:46:56,784
Where are you going?

733
00:46:56,909 --> 00:47:00,162
Promise or no promise,\I  can't stay here another minute.

734
00:47:00,287 --> 00:47:02,831
No, wait, please! Please, wait!

735
00:48:18,991 --> 00:48:19,992
No!

736
00:49:30,187 --> 00:49:32,272
Here, now. Don't do that.

737
00:49:36,485 --> 00:49:38,112
Just hold still.

738
00:49:39,989 --> 00:49:41,031
That hurts!

739
00:49:41,156 --> 00:49:43,033
If you'd hold still,
it wouldn't hurt as much!

740
00:49:43,158 --> 00:49:45,285
Well, if you hadn't have run away,
this wouldn't have happened.

741
00:49:45,411 --> 00:49:48,789
If you hadn't frightened me,\I  wouldn't have run away.

742
00:49:49,331 --> 00:49:51,917
Well, you shouldn't have been
in the west wing!

743
00:49:52,042 --> 00:49:54,962
Well, you should learn
to control your temper.

744
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,759
Now, hold still. This might sting a little.

745
00:50:04,054 --> 00:50:08,183
By the way,
thank you for saving my life.

746
00:50:12,896 --> 00:50:14,398
You're welcome.

747
00:50:21,447 --> 00:50:25,743
I don't usually leave the asylum
in the middle of the night,

748
00:50:25,868 --> 00:50:28,537
but he said
you'd make it worth my while.

749
00:50:31,123 --> 00:50:33,667
-I'm listening.
-It's like this.

750
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:37,087
I've got my heart set on marrying Belle,

751
00:50:37,212 --> 00:50:40,007
but she needs a little persuasion.

752
00:50:40,883 --> 00:50:42,676
Turned him down flat.

753
00:50:43,302 --> 00:50:45,721
Everyone knows her father's a lunatic.

754
00:50:45,846 --> 00:50:49,183
He was in here tonight
raving about a beast in a castle.

755
00:50:49,308 --> 00:50:50,934
Maurice is harmless.

756
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:56,273
The point is, Belle would do anything
to keep him from being locked up.

757
00:50:57,816 --> 00:50:59,693
Yeah, even marry him.

758
00:51:02,071 --> 00:51:05,032
So, you want me to throw her father
into the asylum,

759
00:51:05,157 --> 00:51:07,409
unless she agrees to marry you.

760
00:51:08,494 --> 00:51:10,579
That is despicable.

761
00:51:11,288 --> 00:51:12,289
I love it.

762
00:51:16,001 --> 00:51:19,088
If no one will help me,
then I'll go back alone.

763
00:51:19,254 --> 00:51:22,216
Yes, is that everything?\I  don't care what it takes.

764
00:51:22,383 --> 00:51:24,802
I'll find that castle and somehow, l...

765
00:51:24,969 --> 00:51:26,887
I'll get her out of there.

766
00:51:33,268 --> 00:51:35,229
-Belle! Maurice!
-Oh, well.

767
00:51:36,021 --> 00:51:38,399
Guess it's not gonna work, after all.

768
00:51:38,565 --> 00:51:40,734
They have to come back sometime.

769
00:51:40,901 --> 00:51:44,571
And when they do,
we'll be ready for them.

770
00:51:44,738 --> 00:51:50,869
LeFou, don't move from that spot
until Belle and her father come home.

771
00:51:51,036 --> 00:51:52,496
But... But l...

772
00:51:55,249 --> 00:51:56,250
Nuts.

773
00:52:19,148 --> 00:52:21,692
I've never felt this way about anyone.

774
00:52:23,736 --> 00:52:27,406
I want to do something for her.
But what?

775
00:52:27,573 --> 00:52:29,325
Well, there's the usual things.

776
00:52:29,491 --> 00:52:32,911
Flowers, chocolates,
promises you don't intend to keep.

777
00:52:33,454 --> 00:52:37,082
No, no.
It has to be something very special.

778
00:52:37,249 --> 00:52:40,377
Something that sparks her interest.
Wait a minute.

779
00:52:43,088 --> 00:52:44,173
Belle?

780
00:52:44,965 --> 00:52:47,468
There's something I want to show you.

781
00:52:49,178 --> 00:52:51,764
But first, you have to close your eyes.

782
00:52:54,016 --> 00:52:55,559
It's a surprise.

783
00:53:06,362 --> 00:53:08,739
-Can I open them?
-No, no. Not yet.

784
00:53:10,366 --> 00:53:11,617
Wait here.

785
00:53:16,955 --> 00:53:21,085
-Now can I open them?
-All right. Now.

786
00:53:29,593 --> 00:53:31,804
I can't believe it.

787
00:53:31,971 --> 00:53:34,348
I've never seen so many books
in all my life.

788
00:53:34,515 --> 00:53:37,726
-You... You like it?
-It's wonderful.

789
00:53:37,893 --> 00:53:39,436
Then it's yours.

790
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:42,064
Thank you so much.

791
00:53:42,231 --> 00:53:45,192
-Would you look at that!
-l knew it would work.

792
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:47,528
What? What works?

793
00:53:47,695 --> 00:53:51,031
-It's very encouraging.
-Isn't this exciting?

794
00:53:51,198 --> 00:53:53,409
-I didn't see anything.
-Come along, Chip.

795
00:53:53,575 --> 00:53:55,244
There's chores to be done
in the kitchen.

796
00:53:55,411 --> 00:53:58,872
But what are they talking about?
What's going on? Come on, Mom.

797
00:54:46,045 --> 00:54:49,715
<i>There</i>'<i>s something sweet</i>
<i>and almost kind</i>

798
00:54:49,882 --> 00:54:53,510
<i>But he was mean</i>
<i>and he was coarse and unrefined</i>

799
00:54:53,677 --> 00:54:57,306
<i>And now he</i>'<i>s dear and so unsure</i>

800
00:54:57,473 --> 00:55:01,060
<i>I wonder why</i>
<i>I didn</i>'<i>t see it there before</i>

801
00:55:14,657 --> 00:55:16,575
<i>She glanced this way</i>

802
00:55:16,742 --> 00:55:18,410
<i>I thought I saw</i>

803
00:55:18,577 --> 00:55:22,247
<i>And when we touched</i>
<i>she didn</i>'<i>t shudder at my paw</i>

804
00:55:22,414 --> 00:55:24,124
<i>No, it can</i>'<i>t be</i>

805
00:55:24,291 --> 00:55:26,001
<i>I</i>'<i>ll just ignore</i>

806
00:55:26,168 --> 00:55:30,214
<i>But then she</i>'<i>s never looked at me</i>
<i>that way before</i>

807
00:55:32,549 --> 00:55:38,430
<i>New and a bit alarming</i>

808
00:55:39,014 --> 00:55:41,350
<i>Who</i>'<i>d have ever thought</i>

809
00:55:41,517 --> 00:55:47,940
<i>That this could be</i>

810
00:55:48,107 --> 00:55:50,359
<i>True</i>

811
00:55:50,526 --> 00:55:54,238
<i>That he</i>'<i>s no Prince Charming</i>

812
00:55:54,405 --> 00:55:56,615
<i>But there</i>'<i>s something in him</i>

813
00:55:56,782 --> 00:56:01,370
<i>That I simply didn</i>'<i>t see</i>

814
00:56:02,621 --> 00:56:04,456
-<i>Well, who</i>'<i>d have thought</i>
-<i>Well, bless my soul</i>

815
00:56:04,623 --> 00:56:06,458
-<i>Well, who</i>'<i>d have known</i>
-<i>Well, who, indeed</i>

816
00:56:06,625 --> 00:56:09,211
<i>And who</i>'<i>d have guessed</i>
<i>they</i>'<i>d come together on their own</i>

817
00:56:09,378 --> 00:56:11,839
-<i>It</i>'<i>s so peculiar. Wait and see</i>
-<i>We</i>'<i>ll wait and see</i>

818
00:56:12,006 --> 00:56:13,632
<i>A few days more</i>

819
00:56:13,799 --> 00:56:17,094
<i>There may be something there</i>
<i>that wasn</i>'<i>t there before</i>

820
00:56:19,471 --> 00:56:22,141
<i>You know, perhaps there is something</i>
<i>there that wasn</i>'<i>t there before</i>

821
00:56:23,767 --> 00:56:25,311
What?

822
00:56:25,436 --> 00:56:29,106
<i>There may be something there</i>
<i>that wasn</i>'<i>t there before</i>

823
00:56:29,273 --> 00:56:30,941
What's there, Mama?

824
00:56:32,192 --> 00:56:34,445
I'll tell you when you're older.

825
00:56:36,864 --> 00:56:38,490
Right, then,
you all know why we're here.

826
00:56:38,657 --> 00:56:41,618
We have exactly 1 2 hours,
36 minutes and 1 5 seconds

827
00:56:41,785 --> 00:56:45,247
to create the most magical,
spontaneous, romantic atmosphere

828
00:56:45,414 --> 00:56:47,166
known to man or beast.

829
00:56:53,172 --> 00:56:55,674
Right. Need I remind you

830
00:56:55,841 --> 00:56:59,303
that if the last petal falls from this rose

831
00:56:59,470 --> 00:57:01,639
the spell will never be broken?

832
00:57:03,307 --> 00:57:06,060
Very well.
You all know your assignments.

833
00:57:06,185 --> 00:57:09,355
Half of you to the west wing,
half of you to the east wing,

834
00:57:09,521 --> 00:57:11,649
the rest of you, come with me.

835
00:57:16,779 --> 00:57:19,990
Lighten up, Cogsworth,
and let nature take its course.

836
00:57:20,157 --> 00:57:22,493
It's obvious there's a spark
between them.

837
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:27,081
Yes, but there's no harm
in fanning the flames, you know, a little.

838
00:57:27,581 --> 00:57:32,169
Besides, they must fall in love tonight
if we ever expect to be human again.

839
00:57:32,336 --> 00:57:34,338
-Human again.
-Human again.

840
00:57:35,464 --> 00:57:37,508
Yes, think what that means.

841
00:57:40,636 --> 00:57:43,055
<i>I</i>'<i>ll be cooking again</i>

842
00:57:43,222 --> 00:57:45,057
<i>Be good-looking again</i>

843
00:57:45,224 --> 00:57:48,394
<i>With a</i> mademoiselle <i>on each arm</i>

844
00:57:49,103 --> 00:57:50,854
<i>When I</i>'<i>m human again</i>

845
00:57:51,021 --> 00:57:52,731
<i>Only human again</i>

<i>Chic and sporting again</i>

849
00:58:00,656 --> 00:58:04,201
<i>Which should cause</i>

850
00:58:04,368 --> 00:58:05,995
<i>I</i>'<i>ll hop down off this shelf</i>

851

<i>Only human again</i>

855
00:58:16,797 --> 00:58:20,259
<i>When we</i>'<i>re knickknacks</i>

856
00:58:20,426 --> 00:58:22,052
<i>When we</i>'<i>re human again</i>

857
00:58:22,219 --> 00:58:23,762
<i>Good and human again</i>

<i>I</i>'<i>ll wear gowns, I</i>'<i>ll have hair</i>

864
00:58:38,485 --> 00:58:41,905
<i>It</i>'<i>s my prayer to be human again</i>

865
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:48,537
<i>When we</i>'<i>re human again</i>

866
00:58:48,704 --> 00:58:50,247
<i>Only human again</i>

867
00:58:50,372 --> 00:58:53,584

<i>Can I help it if I</i>'<i>m tense?</i>

871
00:59:00,549 --> 00:59:02,176
<i>In a shack by the sea</i>

872
00:59:02,343 --> 00:59:03,802
<i>I</i>'<i>ll sit back sipping tea</i>

873
00:59:03,969 --> 00:59:07,139

<i>When I</i>'<i>m human again</i>

877
00:59:16,065 --> 00:59:19,443
<i>So, sweep that dust from the floor</i>

878
00:59:19,610 --> 00:59:22,529
<i>Let</i>'<i>s let some light in the room</i>

879
00:59:22,696 --> 00:59:24,239
<i>I can feel, I can tell</i>

880
00:59:24,406 --> 00:59:25,991
<i>Someone might break the spell</i>

881
00:59:26,158 --> 00:59:29,828
<i>Any day now</i>

882
00:59:29,995 --> 00:59:32,831
<i>Shine up the brass on the door</i>

883
00:59:32,998 --> 00:59:36,001
<i>Alert the dustbin and broom</i>

884
00:59:36,168 --> 00:59:37,711

886
00:59:39,630 --> 00:59:43,008
<i>Any day now</i>

887
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:46,971
<i>Open the shutters</i>

888
00:59:47,137 --> 00:59:50,683
<i>Put these here</i>

889
00:59:50,849 --> 00:59:54,144
<i>Sweep up the years</i>

890
00:59:54,311 --> 00:59:58,857

''For never was a story of more woe

01:00:37,438 --> 01:00:39,857
''Than this of Juliet and her Romeo''

905
01:00:42,318 --> 01:00:46,530
-Could you read it again?
-Here, why don't you read it to me?

906
01:00:46,655 --> 01:00:47,906
All right.

907
01:00:52,411 --> 01:00:55,247
-I can't.
-You mean, you never learned?

908
01:00:55,372 --> 01:00:57,708
I learned. A little.

909
01:00:58,542 --> 01:01:01,128
It's just been so long.

910
01:01:01,295 --> 01:01:03,422
Well, here, I'll help you.

911
01:01:03,589 --> 01:01:05,841
-Let's start here.
-Here.

912
01:01:08,385 --> 01:01:10,387
-Okay. ''Twoh...''
-''Two.''

913
01:01:10,554 --> 01:01:14,183
''Two.'' I knew that. ''Two households...''

914
01:01:15,351 --> 01:01:19,647
<i>We</i>'<i>ll be dancing again</i>

915
01:01:19,813 --> 01:01:21,482

01:01:21,649 --> 01:01:24,902
<i>We</i>'<i>ll be whirling around</i>

<i>Only human again</i>

<i>We</i>'<i>ll go waltzing</i>

<i>We</i>'<i>ll be floating again</i>

921
01:01:33,369 --> 01:01:34,995
<i>We</i>'<i>ll be gliding again</i>

01:01:35,162 --> 01:01:38,540
<i>Stepping, striding</i>

923
01:01:38,707 --> 01:01:41,960
<i>Like a real human does</i>

924
01:01:42,127 --> 01:01:45,422
<i>I</i>'<i>ll be all that I was</i>

01:01:45,589 --> 01:01:49,635
<i>On that glorious morn</i>

01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:53,722
<i>And we</i>'<i>re all of us human</i>

927
01:01:53,889 --> 01:02:00,688
<i>Again</i>

928
01:02:11,824 --> 01:02:13,534
Tonight is the night.

929
01:02:16,036 --> 01:02:19,164
-I'm not sure I can do this.
-You don't have time to be timid.

930
01:02:19,331 --> 01:02:21,500
You must be bold, daring.

931
01:02:21,667 --> 01:02:23,043
Bold. Daring.

932
01:02:27,047 --> 01:02:29,299
There will be music,
romantic candlelight

933
01:02:29,466 --> 01:02:30,592
provided by myself.

934
01:02:32,845 --> 01:02:36,056
And when the moment is right,
you confess your love.

935
01:02:36,974 --> 01:02:38,726
Yes, l...

936
01:02:38,892 --> 01:02:40,894
l... l... No, I can't.

937
01:02:41,061 --> 01:02:44,648
-You care for the girl, don't you?
-More than anything.

938
01:02:44,815 --> 01:02:46,859
Well, then, you must tell her.

939
01:02:48,777 --> 01:02:50,779
<i>Voilà!</i> You look so, so...

940
01:02:50,946 --> 01:02:52,072
Stupid.

941
01:02:54,575 --> 01:02:55,659
Not quite the word I was looking for.

942
01:02:57,328 --> 01:02:59,288
Perhaps a little more off the top.

943
01:03:03,667 --> 01:03:05,502
Your lady awaits.

944
01:03:30,402 --> 01:03:32,821
<i>Tale as old as time</i>

945
01:03:35,449 --> 01:03:37,951
<i>True as it can be</i>

946
01:03:40,788 --> 01:03:43,374
<i>Barely even friends</i>

947
01:03:43,540 --> 01:03:46,085
<i>Then somebody bends</i>

948
01:03:46,251 --> 01:03:48,087
<i>Unexpectedly</i>

949
01:03:51,256 --> 01:03:53,342
<i>Just a little change</i>

950
01:03:56,136 --> 01:03:58,681
<i>Small to say the least</i>

951
01:03:58,847 --> 01:04:01,517
<i>Both a little scared</i>

952
01:04:01,684 --> 01:04:04,019
<i>Neither one prepared</i>

953
01:04:04,186 --> 01:04:07,022
<i>Beauty and the Beast</i>

954
01:04:09,858 --> 01:04:12,528
<i>Ever just the same</i>

955
01:04:14,905 --> 01:04:18,534
<i>Ever a surprise</i>

956
01:04:20,035 --> 01:04:22,496
<i>Ever as before</i>

957
01:04:22,663 --> 01:04:24,790
<i>Ever just as sure</i>

958
01:04:24,957 --> 01:04:28,419
<i>As the sun will rise</i>

959
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:32,881
<i>Tale as old as time</i>

960
01:04:34,967 --> 01:04:37,720
<i>Tune as old as song</i>

961
01:04:40,139 --> 01:04:42,516
<i>Bittersweet and strange</i>

962
01:04:42,683 --> 01:04:44,893
<i>Finding you can change</i>

963
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:47,813
<i>Learning you were wrong</i>

964
01:04:50,065 --> 01:04:53,319
<i>Certain as the sun</i>

965
01:04:55,070 --> 01:04:57,573
<i>Rising in the east</i>

966
01:04:57,740 --> 01:05:00,075
<i>Tale as old as time</i>

967
01:05:00,242 --> 01:05:03,203
<i>Song as old as rhyme</i>

968
01:05:03,370 --> 01:05:05,914
<i>Beauty and the Beast</i>

969
01:05:09,418 --> 01:05:12,254
<i>Tale as old as time</i>

970
01:05:12,379 --> 01:05:16,592
<i>Song as old as rhyme</i>

971
01:05:16,759 --> 01:05:23,223
<i>Beauty and the Beast</i>

972
01:05:24,183 --> 01:05:28,062
Off to the cupboard with you now, Chip.
It's past your bedtime.

973
01:05:30,397 --> 01:05:31,940
Good night, love.

974
01:05:56,048 --> 01:05:57,132
Belle?

975
01:05:59,802 --> 01:06:02,471
Are you happy here with me?

976
01:06:03,138 --> 01:06:04,139
Yes.

977
01:06:09,103 --> 01:06:10,396
What is it?

978
01:06:11,939 --> 01:06:15,609
If only I could see my father again,
just for a moment.

979
01:06:15,776 --> 01:06:17,403
I miss him so much.

980
01:06:22,992 --> 01:06:24,451
There is a way.

981
01:06:27,705 --> 01:06:30,124
This mirror will show you anything.

982
01:06:30,290 --> 01:06:32,167
Anything you wish to see.

983
01:06:33,210 --> 01:06:35,546
I'd like to see my father, please.

984
01:06:43,095 --> 01:06:45,347
Papa. Oh, no.

985
01:06:46,223 --> 01:06:49,893
He's sick. He may be dying,
and he's all alone.

986
01:06:56,692 --> 01:06:59,361
Then you must go to him.

987
01:07:00,112 --> 01:07:01,488
What did you say?

988
01:07:01,613 --> 01:07:04,992
I release you.
You're no longer my prisoner.

989
01:07:05,159 --> 01:07:08,871
-You mean I'm free?
-Yes.

990
01:07:10,581 --> 01:07:14,543
Thank you.
Hold on, Papa. I'm on my way.

991
01:07:17,629 --> 01:07:19,214
Take it with you

992
01:07:19,381 --> 01:07:23,218
so you'll always have a way
to look back and remember me.

993
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:30,726
Thank you for understanding
how much he needs me.

994
01:07:39,109 --> 01:07:43,864
Well, Your Highness, I must say
everything is going just swimmingly.

995
01:07:44,031 --> 01:07:46,867
I knew you had it in you.

996
01:07:46,992 --> 01:07:48,952
I let her go.

997
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:51,080
Yes, yes...

998
01:07:51,997 --> 01:07:54,208
You what?

999
01:07:54,375 --> 01:07:57,294
-How could you do that?
-l had to.

1000
01:07:57,461 --> 01:08:00,214
Yes, but... But why?

1001
01:08:00,839 --> 01:08:02,675
Because I love her.

1002
01:08:04,343 --> 01:08:05,803
He did what?

1003
01:08:05,928 --> 01:08:10,057
-Yes, I'm afraid it's true.
-She's going away?

1004
01:08:10,182 --> 01:08:12,101
But he was so close.

1005
01:08:12,267 --> 01:08:16,647
After all this time,
he's finally learned to love.

1006
01:08:16,814 --> 01:08:19,274
That's it then.
That should break the spell.

1007
01:08:19,441 --> 01:08:22,903
But it's not enough.
She has to love him in return.

1008
01:08:23,070 --> 01:08:24,196
Now it's too late.

1009
01:08:35,416 --> 01:08:36,458
Papa?

1010
01:08:37,376 --> 01:08:38,377
Papa?

1011
01:08:52,725 --> 01:08:54,101
They're back.

1012
01:08:56,562 --> 01:08:57,646
Belle.

1013
01:08:59,231 --> 01:09:01,483
It's all right, Papa. I'm home.

1014
01:09:03,152 --> 01:09:05,654
I thought I'd never see you again.

1015
01:09:06,530 --> 01:09:09,116
-I missed you so much!
-But the Beast...

1016
01:09:09,283 --> 01:09:11,869
-Did you... How did you escape?
-l didn't escape, Papa.

1017
01:09:12,036 --> 01:09:15,247
-He... He let me go.
-That horrible beast?

1018
01:09:15,414 --> 01:09:19,710
But he's different now, Papa.
He's changed somehow.

1019
01:09:25,257 --> 01:09:28,344
-Hi!
-A stowaway.

1020
01:09:28,844 --> 01:09:31,305
Why, hello there, little fella.

1021
01:09:32,097 --> 01:09:34,016
Didn't think I'd see you again.

1022
01:09:34,183 --> 01:09:36,685
Belle, why'd you go away?

1023
01:09:36,852 --> 01:09:39,188
Don't you like us any more?

1024
01:09:39,355 --> 01:09:42,191
Chip, of course I do. It's just that...

1025
01:09:45,694 --> 01:09:49,198
-May I help you?
-I've come to collect your father.

1026
01:09:49,365 --> 01:09:52,117
-My father?
-Don't worry, <i>mademoiselle</i>.

1027
01:09:52,284 --> 01:09:54,703
We'll take good care of him.

1028
01:09:55,537 --> 01:09:59,083
-My father's not crazy!
-He was raving like a lunatic!

1029
01:09:59,249 --> 01:10:02,378
-We all heard him, didn't we?
-Yes!

1030
01:10:03,212 --> 01:10:05,964
-No, I won't let you!
-Belle?

1031
01:10:06,090 --> 01:10:09,343
Maurice, tell us again, old man.

1032
01:10:09,510 --> 01:10:12,054
Just how big was the beast?

1033
01:10:12,930 --> 01:10:16,058
He was... I mean, he was...
He was enormous!

1034
01:10:16,225 --> 01:10:20,437
I'd... I'd say at least eight,
no, more like 1 0 feet!

1035
01:10:22,314 --> 01:10:25,067
Well, you don't get much crazier
than that.

1036
01:10:25,985 --> 01:10:27,778
It's true, I tell you.

1037
01:10:28,487 --> 01:10:31,323
-Get him out of here!
-Let go of me!

1038
01:10:31,490 --> 01:10:33,575
No! You can't do this!

1039
01:10:35,119 --> 01:10:38,247
Poor Belle.
It's a shame about your father.

1040
01:10:38,414 --> 01:10:40,874
You know he's not crazy, Gaston.

1041
01:10:41,041 --> 01:10:45,838
I might be able to clear up
this little misunderstanding if...

1042
01:10:46,005 --> 01:10:48,757
-If what?
-If you marry me.

1043
01:10:48,924 --> 01:10:51,093
-What?
-One little word, Belle.

1044
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:53,095
-That's all it takes.
-Never!

1045
01:10:53,262 --> 01:10:54,513
Have it your way.

1046
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:57,808
Belle? Let go of me!

1047
01:10:58,517 --> 01:11:01,270
My father's not crazy
and I can prove it.

1048
01:11:01,437 --> 01:11:02,980
Show me the Beast.

1049
01:11:07,985 --> 01:11:11,363
-Is it dangerous?
-No, no, he'd never hurt anyone.

1050
01:11:11,530 --> 01:11:15,451
Please, I know he looks vicious,
but he's really kind and gentle.

1051
01:11:16,535 --> 01:11:18,620
-He's my friend.
-If I didn't know better,

1052
01:11:18,787 --> 01:11:21,707
I'd think you had feelings
for this monster.

1053
01:11:21,874 --> 01:11:24,626
He's no monster, Gaston. You are!

1054
01:11:25,544 --> 01:11:28,088
She's as crazy as the old man.

1055
01:11:28,756 --> 01:11:30,799
The Beast will make off
with your children.

1056
01:11:30,966 --> 01:11:32,426
-He'll come after them in the night.
-No.

1057
01:11:32,551 --> 01:11:35,387
We're not safe till his head
is mounted on my wall!

1058
01:11:35,512 --> 01:11:37,389
I say we kill the Beast!

1059
01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:39,975
<i>We</i>'<i>re not safe until he</i>'<i>s dead</i>

1060
01:11:40,142 --> 01:11:41,769
<i>He</i>'<i>ll come stalking us at night</i>

1061
01:11:41,935 --> 01:11:43,479
<i>Set to sacrifice our children</i>

1062
01:11:43,646 --> 01:11:45,314
<i>To his monstrous appetite</i>

1063
01:11:45,481 --> 01:11:47,066
<i>He</i>'<i>ll wreak havoc on our village</i>

1064
01:11:47,232 --> 01:11:48,984
<i>If we let him wander free</i>

1065
01:11:49,151 --> 01:11:52,738
<i>So, it</i>'<i>s time to take some action, boys</i>

1066
01:11:52,905 --> 01:11:59,036
<i>It</i>'<i>s time to follow me</i>

1067
01:11:59,578 --> 01:12:02,623
<i>Through the mist, through the woods</i>
<i>through the darkness and the shadows</i>

1068
01:12:02,790 --> 01:12:05,834
<i>It</i>'<i>s a nightmare</i>
<i>but it</i>'<i>s one exciting ride</i>

1069
01:12:06,001 --> 01:12:09,129
<i>Say a prayer, then we</i>'<i>re there</i>
<i>at the drawbridge of a castle</i>

1070
01:12:09,296 --> 01:12:12,341
<i>And there</i>'<i>s something</i>
<i>truly terrible inside</i>

1071
01:12:12,508 --> 01:12:15,594
<i>It</i>'<i>s a beast</i>
<i>He</i>'<i>s got fangs, razor-sharp ones</i>

1072
01:12:15,761 --> 01:12:18,973
<i>Massive paws, killer claws</i>
<i>for the feast</i>

1073
01:12:19,139 --> 01:12:20,683
<i>Hear him roar, see him foam</i>

1074
01:12:20,808 --> 01:12:22,267
<i>But we</i>'<i>re not coming home</i>

1075
01:12:22,434 --> 01:12:26,563
<i>Till he</i>'<i>s dead, good and dead</i>
<i>Kill the Beast!</i>

1076
01:12:26,689 --> 01:12:28,065
No, I won't let you do this.

1077
01:12:28,190 --> 01:12:31,944
If you're not with us, you're against us.
Bring the old man!

1078
01:12:32,111 --> 01:12:33,696
Get your hands off me!

1079
01:12:33,862 --> 01:12:36,323
We can't have them running off
to warn the creature.

1080
01:12:36,490 --> 01:12:39,910
-Let us out!
-We'll rid the village of this beast!

1081
01:12:40,077 --> 01:12:42,162
-Who's with me?
-l am!

1082
01:12:42,329 --> 01:12:43,539
-I am!
-l am!

1083
01:12:43,706 --> 01:12:45,082
<i>Light your torch, mount your horse</i>

1084
01:12:45,249 --> 01:12:46,917
<i>Screw your courage</i>
<i>to the sticking place</i>

1085
01:12:47,084 --> 01:12:49,920
<i>We</i>'<i>re counting on Gaston</i>
<i>to lead the way</i>

1086
01:12:50,045 --> 01:12:53,048
<i>Through a mist, to a wood</i>
<i>where within a haunted castle</i>

1087
01:12:53,215 --> 01:12:56,343
<i>Something</i>'<i>s lurking</i>
<i>that you don</i>'<i>t see every day</i>

1088
01:12:56,510 --> 01:12:59,638
<i>It</i>'<i>s a beast</i>
<i>One as tall as a mountain</i>

1089
01:12:59,805 --> 01:13:02,891
<i>We won</i>'<i>t rest</i>
<i>till he</i>'<i>s good and deceased</i>

1090
01:13:03,058 --> 01:13:04,518
<i>Sally forth, tally-ho</i>

1091
01:13:04,685 --> 01:13:06,228
<i>Grab your sword and your bow</i>

1092
01:13:06,395 --> 01:13:07,855
<i>Praise the Lord and here we go</i>

1093
01:13:08,022 --> 01:13:11,442
We'll lay siege to the castle
and bring back his head!

1094
01:13:12,318 --> 01:13:15,446
I have to warn the Beast.
This is all my fault.

1095
01:13:15,612 --> 01:13:20,034
-Papa, what are we going to do?
-Now, now. We'll think of something.

1096
01:13:27,958 --> 01:13:30,085
<i>We don</i>'<i>t like</i>
<i>what we don</i>'<i>t understand</i>

1097
01:13:30,252 --> 01:13:31,211
<i>In fact, it scares us</i>

1098
01:13:31,378 --> 01:13:34,423
<i>And this monster</i>
<i>is mysterious at least</i>

1099
01:13:34,590 --> 01:13:36,216
<i>Bring your guns, bring your knives</i>

1100
01:13:36,383 --> 01:13:37,593
<i>Save your children and your wives</i>

1101
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:40,929
<i>We</i>'<i>ll save our village and our lives</i>

1102
01:13:41,096 --> 01:13:42,056
<i>We</i>'<i>ll kill the Beast</i>

1103
01:13:43,057 --> 01:13:46,226
I knew it. I knew it was foolish
to get our hopes up.

1104
01:13:46,393 --> 01:13:49,980
Maybe it would have been better
if she'd never come at all.

1105
01:13:50,147 --> 01:13:52,441
-Could it be...
-Is it she?

1106
01:13:52,608 --> 01:13:54,818
<i>Sacrebleu!</i> lnvaders!

1107
01:13:54,985 --> 01:13:57,112
-Encroachers.
-And they have the mirror.

1108
01:13:57,279 --> 01:13:58,238
Warn the master.

1109
01:13:58,405 --> 01:14:00,407
If it's a fight they want,
we'll be ready for them.

1110
01:14:00,574 --> 01:14:02,326
Who's with me?

1111
01:14:02,493 --> 01:14:04,411
Take whatever booty you can find.

1112
01:14:04,578 --> 01:14:07,081
But remember, the Beast is mine!

1113
01:14:07,247 --> 01:14:09,083
<i>Hearts ablaze, banners high</i>

1114
01:14:09,249 --> 01:14:10,709
<i>We go marching into battle</i>

1115
01:14:10,876 --> 01:14:13,671
<i>Unafraid, although the danger</i>
<i>just increased</i>

1116
01:14:14,088 --> 01:14:15,547
<i>Raise the flag, sing the song</i>

1117
01:14:15,714 --> 01:14:17,007
<i>Here we come, we</i>'<i>re 50 strong</i>

1118
01:14:17,174 --> 01:14:20,260
<i>And 50 Frenchmen can</i>'<i>t be wrong</i>

1119
01:14:20,427 --> 01:14:22,096
<i>Let</i>'<i>s kill the Beast</i>

1120
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:25,432
-Pardon me, Master.
-Leave me in peace.

1121
01:14:25,599 --> 01:14:27,935
But, sir, the castle is under attack.

1122
01:14:28,644 --> 01:14:31,105
<i>Kill the Beast! Kill the Beast!</i>

1123
01:14:31,689 --> 01:14:35,943
-This isn't working.
-Lumiere, we must do something!

1124
01:14:36,110 --> 01:14:37,611
Wait! I know!

1125
01:14:38,529 --> 01:14:41,115
<i>Kill the Beast! Kill the Beast!</i>

1126
01:14:42,241 --> 01:14:44,284
What shall we do, Master?

1127
01:14:44,451 --> 01:14:46,453
It doesn't matter now.

1128
01:14:46,620 --> 01:14:47,955
Just let them come.

1129
01:14:48,122 --> 01:14:51,291
<i>Kill the Beast! Kill the Beast!</i>

1130
01:14:51,458 --> 01:14:53,127
<i>Kill the Beast!</i>

1131
01:15:05,639 --> 01:15:06,640
Now!

1132
01:15:27,619 --> 01:15:28,620
Yes!

1133
01:15:32,499 --> 01:15:34,084
Here we go!

1134
01:15:37,671 --> 01:15:39,131
What the devil?

1135
01:15:40,174 --> 01:15:41,717
Belle, look out!

1136
01:15:47,973 --> 01:15:50,142
You guys gotta try this thing.

1137
01:15:55,314 --> 01:15:57,691
Up here, you scurvy scum.

1138
01:15:58,442 --> 01:15:59,652
Now!

1139
01:17:09,346 --> 01:17:11,265
And stay out.

1140
01:17:41,962 --> 01:17:43,088
Get up.

1141
01:17:44,882 --> 01:17:45,966
Get up.

1142
01:17:46,675 --> 01:17:48,594
What's the matter, Beast?

1143
01:17:50,095 --> 01:17:52,931
Too kind and gentle to fight back?

1144
01:18:00,564 --> 01:18:01,523
No!

1145
01:18:04,777 --> 01:18:07,613
-Belle.
-No, Gaston, don't.

1146
01:18:13,661 --> 01:18:15,329
Let's go, Philippe.

1147
01:18:40,479 --> 01:18:42,272
Come on out and fight!

1148
01:18:44,608 --> 01:18:47,486
Were you in love with her, Beast?

1149
01:18:47,653 --> 01:18:50,030
Did you honestly think she'd want you

1150
01:18:50,197 --> 01:18:52,366
when she had someone like me?

1151
01:19:04,169 --> 01:19:08,215
It's over, Beast! Belle is mine!

1152
01:19:13,304 --> 01:19:16,724
Let me go. Let me go.
Please, don't hurt me.

1153
01:19:16,890 --> 01:19:18,892
I'll do anything. Anything!

1154
01:19:33,198 --> 01:19:34,366
Get out.

1155
01:19:35,993 --> 01:19:37,077
Beast!

1156
01:19:38,245 --> 01:19:39,330
Belle.

1157
01:19:48,422 --> 01:19:49,506
Belle?

1158
01:19:55,346 --> 01:19:56,805
You came back.

1159
01:20:36,136 --> 01:20:37,221
You...

1160
01:20:38,847 --> 01:20:40,307
You came back.

1161
01:20:40,474 --> 01:20:43,852
Of course I came back.\I  couldn't let them...

1162
01:20:44,812 --> 01:20:46,563
This is all my fault.

1163
01:20:46,730 --> 01:20:48,440
If only I'd gotten here sooner.

1164
01:20:48,607 --> 01:20:53,153
Maybe it's better... It's better this way.

1165
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:55,656
Don't talk like that.

1166
01:20:55,823 --> 01:20:58,033
You'll be all right.

1167
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:01,954
We're together now.
Everything's going to be fine, you'll see.

1168
01:21:04,373 --> 01:21:07,376
At least I got to see you

1169
01:21:09,253 --> 01:21:10,671
one last time.

1170
01:21:21,849 --> 01:21:23,475
No. No.

1171
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:28,439
Please. Please. Please don't leave me.

1172
01:21:32,526 --> 01:21:33,819
I love you.

1173
01:23:12,876 --> 01:23:15,170
Belle, it's me.

1174
01:23:31,228 --> 01:23:32,479
It is you.

1175
01:24:05,929 --> 01:24:07,097
Lumiere.

1176
01:24:08,057 --> 01:24:09,308
Cogsworth.

1177
01:24:10,893 --> 01:24:12,186
Mrs Potts!

1178
01:24:13,646 --> 01:24:15,648
-Look at us.
-Mama. Mama.

1179
01:24:20,527 --> 01:24:23,947
-Oh, my goodness.
-It is a miracle.

1180
01:24:34,917 --> 01:24:36,043
<i>L</i>'<i>amour</i>.

1181
01:24:40,381 --> 01:24:43,842
Well, Lumiere, old friend.
Shall we let bygones be bygones?

1182
01:24:44,009 --> 01:24:46,762
Of course, <i>mon ami</i>.\I  told you she would break the spell.

1183
01:24:46,929 --> 01:24:51,433
I beg your pardon, old friend,
but I believe I told you.

1184
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,310
No, you didn't. I told you.

1185
01:24:53,477 --> 01:24:55,187
You most certainly did not,

1186
01:24:55,354 --> 01:24:57,314
you pompous,
paraffin-headed pea-brain!

1187
01:24:57,481 --> 01:25:00,526
<i>En garde</i>, you overgrown pocket watch!

1188
01:25:00,693 --> 01:25:02,569
-Take that.
-Stop shoving.

1189
01:25:05,990 --> 01:25:09,201
Are they gonna live
happily ever after, Mama?

1190
01:25:09,368 --> 01:25:10,995
Of course, my dear.

1191
01:25:11,954 --> 01:25:13,205
Of course.

1192
01:25:14,123 --> 01:25:16,834
Do I still have to sleep in the cupboard?

1193
01:25:20,337 --> 01:25:24,008
<i>Certain as the sun</i>

1194
01:25:25,301 --> 01:25:27,845
<i>Rising in the east</i>

1195
01:25:28,012 --> 01:25:30,306
<i>Tale as old as time</i>

1196
01:25:30,472 --> 01:25:33,058
<i>Song as old as rhyme</i>

1197
01:25:33,225 --> 01:25:38,981
<i>Beauty and the Beast</i>

1198
01:25:39,148 --> 01:25:41,984
<i>Tale as old as time</i>

1199
01:25:42,109 --> 01:25:45,529
<i>Song as old as rhyme</i>

1200
01:25:45,696 --> 01:25:51,327
<i>Beauty and the Beast</i>

1201
01:26:16,122 --> 01:26:20,418
Tale as old as time

1202
01:26:22,295 --> 01:26:26,550
True as it can be

1203
01:26:28,635 --> 01:26:31,680
Barely even friends

1204
01:26:31,763 --> 01:26:34,891
Then somebody bends

1205
01:26:34,975 --> 01:26:39,479
Unexpectedly

1206
01:26:41,064 --> 01:26:44,734
Just a little change

1207
01:26:47,404 --> 01:26:50,365
Small to say the least

1208
01:26:50,448 --> 01:26:53,535
Both a little scared

1209
01:26:53,618 --> 01:26:56,621
Neither one prepared

1210
01:26:56,705 --> 01:27:01,376
Beauty and the beast

1211
01:27:03,044 --> 01:27:07,757
Ever just the same

1212
01:27:09,217 --> 01:27:14,431
Ever a surprise

1213
01:27:15,557 --> 01:27:21,479
Ever as before
and ever just as sure

1214
01:27:21,563 --> 01:27:25,984
As the sun will rise

1215
01:27:52,886 --> 01:27:57,348
Ever just the same

1216
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:05,231
Ever a surprise

1217
01:28:05,315 --> 01:28:08,401
Ever as before

1218
01:28:08,484 --> 01:28:11,446
Ever just as sure

1219
01:28:11,529 --> 01:28:15,325
As the sun will rise

1220
01:28:21,164 --> 01:28:25,001
Tale as old as time

1221
01:28:27,295 --> 01:28:31,382
Tune as old as song

1222
01:28:33,634 --> 01:28:36,679
Bittersweet and strange

1223
01:28:36,763 --> 01:28:39,766
Finding you can change

1224
01:28:39,849 --> 01:28:44,187
Learning you were wrong

1225
01:28:46,063 --> 01:28:49,108
Certain as the sun

1226
01:28:49,192 --> 01:28:52,236
Certain as the sun

1227
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:55,364
Rising in the east

1228
01:28:55,448 --> 01:28:58,367
Tale as old as time

1229
01:28:58,451 --> 01:29:01,579
Song as old as rhyme

1230
01:29:01,662 --> 01:29:06,209
Beauty and the beast

1231
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:10,880
Tale as old as time

1232
01:29:10,963 --> 01:29:14,342
Song as old as rhyme

1233
01:29:14,425 --> 01:29:21,641
Beauty and the beast

1234
01:29:45,498 --> 01:29:54,673
Beauty and the beast
