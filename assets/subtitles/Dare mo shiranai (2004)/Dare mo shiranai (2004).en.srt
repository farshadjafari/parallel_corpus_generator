Hello

5
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:32,021
We've just moved into #203
We're the Fukushimas

6
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,423
I wanted to meet the landlord

7
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:36,558
It's just a token gift

8
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:38,255
Thank you for taking the trouble

9
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:39,922
It's very nice to meet you

10
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,269
Um, my husband's abroad,
you see,

11
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:46,805
so really, it's just the two of us
I hope you'll look out for us

12
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:48,430
Oh, I see
Don't hesitate to ask

13
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:51,874
Thank you very much
Introduce yourself

14
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:53,445
I'm Fukushima Akira

15
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:55,605
I see, are you in Jr. High?

16
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:57,307
I'm in sixth grade

17
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,213
You're so big

18
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:02,152
Once you get to this age,
it's fine, but little ones,

19
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:05,281
we, other tenants tend
to complain about them

20
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:08,519
Oh, he's very mature
He'll be no trouble

21
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,859
Fortunately, he takes after his father,

22
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,525
and he's a really good student

23
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:18,870
But now that he's in sixth grade,
he's ready to learn English...

24
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,347
Mother

25
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,955
Hold on

26
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:51,828
Shh!

27
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:56,806
In the back room, please

28
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,934
The living room?

29
00:02:58,044 --> 00:02:59,102
Yes

30
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:23,902
You just know
that landlord remarked

31
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:28,530
His first wife.
I bet you his first wife died,

32
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:31,132
and he went and married again

33
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:33,540
Just hold on, Shigeru

34
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:34,613
What is this!

35
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,181
Just hold on

36
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:38,449
Here goes

37
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,550
You OK? Was it hot?

38
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:45,589
It's hot

39
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:48,217
Wow, you did a great job

40
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:49,420
It was hot

41
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:51,895
This is your new home

42
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:53,397
Just hold on, Shigeru

43
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,023
Shall we let Shigeru out...

44
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:55,828
I'll let you out

45
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:58,699
Here comes the noisy boy

46
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:02,968
Was it hot?

47
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,236
Super hot

48
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:08,007
You did a great job
We're here

49
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:14,645
OK!
A huge success

50
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:17,414
What floor is this?

51
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:20,616
Our new home is
on the second floor

52
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:23,161
Apartment 203

53
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:28,925
Get back inside, Shigeru

54
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:32,333
What if they see you?

55
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:36,471
We'll have to move all over again
Get inside

56
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:41,445
Get in here!
Hey, Akira

57
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:45,240
Get back inside

58
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:50,713
Shigeru, you've got to
unpack your own toys

59
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,290
I'll go pick up Kyoko
at the station

60
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:58,859
Be careful, off you go
You know the way?

61
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,057
I know

62
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:01,629
I'm off

63
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:03,531
OK, off you go, then

64
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:35,828
Did you wait?

65
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:36,993
You're late

66
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,494
I'm sorry

67
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,777
Is the apartment big?

68
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,779
Yeah, it's three rooms
Pretty big

69
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,282
The washing machine?

70
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:53,551
On the veranda

71
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:56,311
The veranda, huh?

72
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:03,657
Kyoko!

73
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:24,142
We're home

74
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:33,113
I think I know how
to make the soup

75
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:35,318
I know how to make the soup

76
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:37,395
OK, then, you make it

77
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:43,624
Such big chopsticks!
Oh, I'll eat with these

78
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:47,665
Yeah! My favorite

79
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,302
Tasty?

80
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,941
May I have everyone's attention?

81
00:06:57,016 --> 00:07:00,782
Now that we've moved
into a new home,

82
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:05,218
I'm going to explain the rules to you,
one more time

83
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:09,226
Let's promise to keep them, OK?

84
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:10,454
How many are there?

85
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:15,296
OK, first of all,
no loud voices or screaming

86
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:16,231
Can you do that?

87
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:17,529
I can

88
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:21,869
Next, no going outside

89
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:22,736
I know

90
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:26,608
Can you do that?
Not even out on the veranda

91
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,280
OK? Can you keep that promise?

92
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:31,315
Sure!

93
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:33,885
Can you do it,little Shige-monster?

94
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:39,317
You're the one that
has to promise hardest

95
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:43,555
Absolutely no going outside
Can you do that?

96
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:45,625
Bet you can-can

97
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:49,562
He didn't raise his hand

98
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,830
That's right,
remember our old home,

99
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:56,568
we had to leave because
you always threw such tantrums

100
00:07:56,676 --> 00:08:00,635
So, now that we've found
a nice new home,

101
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:03,408
you've got to promise
Can you?

102
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:06,576
How's Kyoko supposed
to do the laundry?

103
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,911
For the laundry,

104
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:11,080
there's no choice, but for Kyoko

105
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,455
to sneak out quietly for the laundry

106
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:18,661
Don't go out with her Shigeru

107
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:23,397
And Akira,
you already know all this,

108
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:28,603
but Mom's sometimes late,
so you'll be in charge

109
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:33,474
That's OK, right?
And study a lot

110
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,677
You really have to get it, Shigeru

111
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:39,511
Do you get it?

112
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:43,952
If you don't...
it's an enema for you!

113
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:47,389
Not an enema, green peppers

114
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:48,653
Green peppers?

115
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:49,523
Why!

116
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,290
Make him eat peppers

117
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:53,388
Oh, that's it, then

118
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:57,560
We'll give Shigeru "The Pepper
Punishment," got that?

119
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:01,796
Next time you're up for a tantrum,
get in the suitcase

120
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,700
Shut up!

121
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:04,798
Like I...

122
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,571
That's the time to climb in

123
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:07,873
That's right, that's right

124
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,948
What a great idea

125
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:12,417
Put him there when he's noisy, OK?

126
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:14,718
We'll all put him in

127
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,127
Mother

128
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:30,261
These tatami mats smell good

129
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:34,066
The tatami?
What do they smell like?

130
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:36,903
Like leaves in nature

131
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:40,870
That's a nice smell, isn't it?

132
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,982
The tatami are still new,
they're still green

133
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:49,450
Make you sleep well?

134
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,416
Good night

135
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:14,837
Will you be late?

136
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:18,178
Today? Let's see...

137
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:22,748
What's today?
Oh, I guess I might...

138
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:24,652
Maybe I'll be late

139
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:26,122
You want dinner?

140
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:30,919
Dinner... dinner...
What's for dinner tonight?

141
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,124
Maybe curry

142
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:36,793
Curry? I want curry!
Save me some curry

143
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:38,826
Please

144
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:41,503
Maybe I'll eat it

145
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:44,204
Off you go

146
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:57,587
Hey, did Mom leave already?

147
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,317
She just left

148
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,892
Dangerous

149
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,884
The piano...

150
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:20,127
I'm going shopping

151
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,467
Off you go

152
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:24,335
Get me an "Apollo Choco"

153
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:25,467
Sure

154
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:09,551
150 yen

155
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,560
Shall I buy persimmons...

156
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,530
No "Apollo Choco"

157
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:36,113
There's a video arcade...
"Inageya Hardwares store"

158
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,485
"Near and far-sighted..."

159
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:46,422
Found it

160
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:49,717
<i>Apollo Choco</i>

161
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,757
<i>No bag, right?</i>

162
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:58,236
Out of 100 Yen, then

163
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:08,846
Thank you very much

164
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:56,351
Save 'em for later...

165
00:14:58,197 --> 00:14:59,687
You OK?

166
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:01,396
I'm fine

167
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:18,506
The bath's ready, brother

168
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:19,777
You can go first

169
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:21,182
OK

170
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,430
Are there carrots?

171
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:39,663
There are carrots

172
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,034
None for me

173
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,937
No, you have to eat them

174
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:55,120
Dinner's ready, Kyoko

175
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,312
OK

176
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:26,176
Shigeru left the carrots, again

177
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:53,301
<i>Elementary Japanese</i>

178
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,059
Look, Mother's home

179
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,150
Hey there, I'm back

180
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,917
Welcome home

181
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:44,294
It's damned cold out there
Warm in here

182
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,193
Weren't you in bed, yet?

183
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:47,956
I was hanging the laundry

184
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,594
What a good girl
Thank you

185
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:54,872
And what do we have here?

186
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:58,970
Can I have some?

187
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:01,507
Damn. It's cold

188
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:02,671
Welcome home

189
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:03,543
I'm home

190
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:04,638
Oops

191
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:06,677
Got it?

192
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:07,816
I can't

193
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,978
No way

194
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,555
It clicked but went out

195
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,254
All yours

196
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:19,455
Did I get this right?

197
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:21,059
What's this?

198
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:26,126
"A nation that flourished.

199
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,664
"in about 300 C.C."

200
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,798
What don't you understand?

201
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:33,343
Just wondered if I got it right

202
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:37,314
No, it should be "300 B.C."

203
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:43,216
When you don't know,
you look it up in here

204
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:45,256
That way, you'll learn

205
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,624
Wow, is this Shigeru's?

206
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,856
Wow, what's this?

207
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,029
This yours? Kyoko's?

208
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:02,731
I hate math...

209
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:07,274
Six times six is...

210
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:12,547
Six-six, six-six...

211
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:16,813
Hurry, six-six

212
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:18,583
I can do it

213
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:23,451
Six-six is thirty-six...

214
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:31,759
Hello, yes

215
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:38,068
It's noisy there, awful noisy

216
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:41,940
Where are you? Karaoke?

217
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:48,712
Not now, it's too late

218
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:55,123
What? Who's there?
Oh, really, what a shame...

219
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:54,544
And-a 2

220
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:57,485
And-a, and-a 3

221
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:58,915
Hey, oh no

222
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,256
And-a 1, hey

223
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:03,826
And-a 3

224
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:05,595
And-a, and-a 4

225
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:06,896
Wow!

226
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:12,160
Oh, me? And-a, and-a 2
Wow!

227
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:17,138
Oh, no, I'm the loser who
has to go without dinner!

228
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:19,833
You won't get sleepy

229
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:23,642
If there's no lid on,

230
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:27,845
what could be inside?

231
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,887
You can't tell

232
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:33,219
See, if you close your eyes
and put it in,

233
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:35,793
if you put it in but you don't know...

234
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:54,973
Mother

235
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:59,343
I want to go to school

236
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:04,388
School?
You wouldn't have any fun at school

237
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:11,222
Besides, when you don't have a Daddy,
they bully you at school

238
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,931
You don't need to go to school

239
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:24,532
Wow, feels really great
Great smell, did you smell t?

240
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,711
Stinks of sunlight

241
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:29,940
Stink s of sunlight?

242
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:34,109
Stinkls of sunlight
What a beautiful day...

243
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,518
Your mother,

244
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:48,191
is in love with someone now

245
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,830
Again?

246
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:56,939
Not again
This guy's really

247
00:22:57,142 --> 00:23:01,806
sweet and serious

248
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,774
I think he is really
looking out for me

249
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:12,785
So, if he promises to really...

250
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:16,624
to really marry me,

251
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:22,463
then we can all live in a big house
and you can all go to school

252
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,127
and Kyoko can play the piano...

253
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:29,273
So just hang on a little longer

254
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:32,170
I really think this time probably...

255
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:45,076
I'm home

256
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:48,781
I'm home

257
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:52,521
Here we are, sushi

258
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:56,324
I'm home, meow

259
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,128
Were you asleep?

260
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:02,633
C'mon, c'mon guys,
the sushi was a present

261
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:05,999
A sushi present, c'mon, c'mon

262
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,433
You wake up?

263
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:11,975
You wake up? You mad?

264
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:15,840
C'mon over, come over,
c'mon over, Yuki

265
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:18,773
She stinks of booze

266
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:23,321
Aren't you cold?
Were you asleep? I'm sorry

267
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:27,482
It's just that your Mommy had
a pretty good time today

268
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:31,626
Here you are, Mom

269
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,823
Oh, thank you

270
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:57,411
Akira

271
00:25:58,356 --> 00:25:59,880
Listen, Akira...

272
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:03,717
he's starting to look
just like his father

273
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:08,127
He's got his father's eyes, exactly

274
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:13,935
You brother's father...

275
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:16,866
used to work at Haneda

276
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:22,570
You know what Haneda is?
It's a place with lots of airplanes

277
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:26,811
You know, right Shigeru?
That's where he used to work

278
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:31,981
Oh, I know, listen, Akira

279
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,590
Remember going to see your father?

280
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:36,888
I don't

281
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:41,864
We took the Monorail to
get to Haneda Airport

282
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:44,760
You forget?

283
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:45,893
Yeah

284
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:50,269
Kyoko your father was...

285
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,240
a music producer...

286
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:59,716
I know! Let's give Kyoko's...

287
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:03,083
pretty hands a nice manicure

288
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:12,195
Your mother... actually...

289
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:17,763
wanted to be a singer

290
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:21,934
And I really made it...
part way

291
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:24,898
With your father, Kyoko

292
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:27,938
Oops, way too much

293
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:33,045
I was going to cut a record...

294
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:36,911
And we were almost ready

295
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:40,048
when the deal fell apart

296
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:44,894
Your mother really wanted to, but...

297
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:35,073
<i>Dear Akira, Your mother's
going away for a little while</i>

298
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,616
<i>Please look after Kyoko,
Shigeru and Yuki</i>

299
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:00,822
I'm going shopping

300
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:02,422
Sure, off you go, then

301
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:06,129
And also, mother won't be
coming back for a while

302
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,168
Why not?

303
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:11,402
Something to do with work, I think
I'm off

304
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:12,874
Off you go

305
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:47,476
<i>Please enter your
deposit account...</i>

306
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:03,688
The rent... electricity bill,
phone and gas...

307
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:07,390
And also...

308
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,690
tissues...

309
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,864
Let's go to my office

310
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,034
Do you always do this?

311
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:28,475
No, I don't

312
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,374
Your first time?

313
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,049
I didn't take anything

314
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:36,819
Then what's a this doing here?

315
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:43,587
Your name?

316
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:45,723
Fukushima Akira

317
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:49,357
Fukushima... Akira...

318
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:52,030
School?

319
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:56,472
Your father's name?

320
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:58,470
I don't have a father

321
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:00,138
No father?

322
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:04,575
Your mother. Then?

323
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:08,585
She's gone away to work
for a while

324
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,784
Where did she go?

325
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,982
If you won't tell me,
I'll have to call the police

326
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:17,322
Sir,

327
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,461
I don't think this boy stole that

328
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:26,266
I think the boys reading comics
over there put them in his bag

329
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:27,663
It wasn't him?

330
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:29,899
No, I don't think so

331
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:32,338
Why didn't you speak up?

332
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:33,637
I'm sorry

333
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:37,977
Don't "I'm sorry," me

334
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:53,123
This is just between us, OK?
The meat buns are a little bonus

335
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:57,533
Hurry, give it to him

336
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,034
Thank you very much

337
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:40,042
Is that a plus sign?

338
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:41,270
That's right

339
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:52,620
9,824 Yen

340
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:56,591
9,824 Yen?

341
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:03,023
I forgot to add this...

342
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:50,633
Hello

343
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:14,688
Isn't this your day off?

344
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:18,394
I'm driving again tonight
No use staying home

345
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:48,896
How's your Mom?

346
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,696
She hasn't been home in a month

347
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,498
For real?

348
00:37:57,708 --> 00:37:59,073
How old are you, Akira?

349
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:00,803
I'm 12

350
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:07,279
And Yuki?

351
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:09,649
Yuki's fine

352
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:13,646
She takes after me?

353
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:17,088
Yes, she does

354
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:20,690
For real...

355
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:38,635
Akira!

356
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:44,371
Shit, I'm 10 Yen short
Lend me 10 Yen

357
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:46,879
What, 10 Yen?

358
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:48,747
Why make a big deal over 10 Yen?

359
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:50,946
What's with that damned big wallet?

360
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:53,046
It's a hand-me-down
from my mother

361
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:54,055
From who?

362
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:55,420
From my mother...

363
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,495
You moved, right?

364
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:05,825
The new place big?

365
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:08,102
Any pubic hair, yet?

366
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:09,035
No...

367
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,767
Liar, got mine in 5th grade

368
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:11,967
No way

369
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:14,076
That's the truth

370
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:19,042
It's just...

371
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:21,374
What are you smirking about?

372
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:26,817
It's just that since mother's gone,

373
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:29,358
It's just, there's no money

374
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:32,428
For real? I don't have any money

375
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:35,693
What've you got left?

376
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:36,867
About 10,000 Yen

377
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:38,434
10,000 Yen is enough

378
00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:43,598
I'm in a helluva jam, myself

379
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:47,143
My girlfriend, you know,

380
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:52,838
she totally maxed out my credit cards
I'm in credit card hell, man

381
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:56,511
So I'm working my ass off,
slowly paying it down, man

382
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:11,729
This is all I've got on me
This is it, the last time

383
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:13,264
Thank you

384
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:16,572
A right, I'm off

385
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:20,569
By the way, Yuki's not my kid

386
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:24,978
Every time I did it with your mom,
I used a condom. Bye, then

387
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:26,140
Bye, then

388
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:28,078
Thanks for this

389
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:32,154
Bye

390
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:42,991
Oh, no, I'm hopeless

391
00:41:44,768 --> 00:41:47,293
Gotta get it in

392
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,864
So cold...

393
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:09,450
I spent 674 Yen
at the supermark et

394
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:13,155
I have 650 Yen left in my wallet

395
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:16,623
How many Yen were in my wallet
to begin with?

396
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:29,743
Soon, I came across Bubu the Pig,
planting turnip seeds in a field

397
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,576
What a nice bag you have there

398
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:34,514
My mother made it for me

399
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:46,628
Where, where, where is it?

400
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,977
You can't go out, Shigeru

401
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,808
I'm not out

402
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:06,209
I'm not out

403
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:11,877
I'm home!

404
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:14,048
We come home

405
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,250
How've you guys been?

406
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:20,492
Hey, how've you guys been?

407
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:23,533
See, I'm home

408
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:27,229
Look, presents
This one's for Yuki

409
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:28,930
Thank you

410
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:31,234
For you, Shigeru

411
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,609
I'm home

412
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:38,843
Akira, Akira

413
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:44,877
Wow, it's been a while

414
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:47,452
Shall I open it for you?

415
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,859
You can carry it on your back

416
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:54,955
Wow!

417
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:55,997
It's cute

418
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,500
Carry it? Carry it?
Like a backpack

419
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:03,636
You can put your things inside,
and do that...

420
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:08,502
The sides? Your ears? Out?

421
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:10,341
Ears out?

422
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:17,878
You look so neat
He looks better with short hair

423
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:20,819
Which is more becoming, Yuk?
Long or...

424
00:44:20,924 --> 00:44:21,686
Long

425
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:26,320
You I like him better with long hair?
Oh, no but I'll cut it anyway

426
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:28,655
A little bit shorter's OK, right?

427
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:35,561
What's that face for?

428
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:40,171
Don't tell me,
I cut your bangs too short

429
00:44:40,277 --> 00:44:43,075
You're fine, right?
Too short?

430
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,977
I don't believe it

431
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:50,318
Anyway, it'll grow right back out
Don't act so cool

432
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:51,945
You look cute

433
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:53,954
I mean it

434
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:56,954
Here goes!

435
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:03,558
Maribo!

436
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:07,300
A chop! The pits!

437
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:12,602
Chop Maribo!

438
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,710
Maribo!

439
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:18,708
Maribo!

440
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:53,010
Hey, what are you doing?
Kyoko

441
00:45:55,185 --> 00:45:59,053
What are you doing?
Don't touch my things

442
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:04,957
It's your fault
It won't come out...

443
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:08,562
Where were you, really, Mother?

444
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:12,597
I told you I was working

445
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:14,500
A whole month?

446
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:18,769
I was in Osaka
It was just too far

447
00:46:20,377 --> 00:46:23,403
I told you not to touch my things

448
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:08,885
What are you doing?

449
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:12,951
What? You see, today,

450
00:47:13,063 --> 00:47:16,555
your mother has to step out,
so I'm getting ready

451
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,100
You're going already?

452
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:22,161
Your mother's... busy today

453
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:26,700
But listen,
I'll be back for Christmas

454
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:37,215
Only 5,000 Yen?

455
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:43,057
He could've lent you a little more,
I mean, you're little kids in a jam

456
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:46,027
But hey, pachinko parlors and taxis,

457
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:49,257
I don't draw customers
in such hard times

458
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:55,167
But you go back to him
if you need to

459
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:58,202
It's cold

460
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:03,271
And the wind's blowing so hard
It's so cold...

461
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:08,983
Did you tell the man you're seeing
about us?

462
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:20,489
I told you, I'll tell him eventually...

463
00:48:41,285 --> 00:48:42,684
Sugar

464
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:46,749
You've got sugar there

465
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:53,328
God, you're irritating

466
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:58,694
Listen, I keep ask ng you,

467
00:48:59,736 --> 00:49:02,136
when will you let us go to school?

468
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:06,073
What's this "school this, school that"?
Who needs to go to school anyway?

469
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:10,203
Plenty of famous people never
even went to school in the first place

470
00:49:10,314 --> 00:49:11,508
Like who?

471
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:17,251
How should I know
But plenty of them...

472
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:21,684
You're so selfish, mother

473
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:24,292
How can you say that?

474
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:28,698
Selfish? You want to know
who's really selfish?

475
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:32,291
Your father's the one who's selfish,
up and disappearing like that

476
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:37,966
What is this?
I'm not allowed to be happy?

477
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:40,607
What is this?

478
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:02,492
Oh, I know someone famous

479
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:08,667
Prime Minister Tanaka
Ever heard of him?

480
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:10,895
Never

481
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,373
You're too young

482
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:17,174
How about...
the wrestler Antonio Inoki?

483
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:20,709
I bet he never went to school
I'm not sure, but...

484
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:22,216
Sure, he did

485
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:26,183
Man, you're a drag
Hurry up and finish eating

486
00:50:37,901 --> 00:50:39,926
I send you money, soon

487
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:41,835
You'll come home for Christmas?

488
00:50:41,938 --> 00:50:43,405
Sure, I'll come home

489
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:47,501
I'll be right home
You take care, of them, too

490
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:09,890
Is Totoro really real?

491
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:13,187
Don't you know how big Totoro is?

492
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:14,388
I know

493
00:52:14,498 --> 00:52:16,022
I know, he's really big

494
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:20,399
It'd be a real mess if
he was walking around

495
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:23,473
The police would've catched him

496
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,110
Think there are UFOs?

497
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:29,109
Nope

498
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:29,974
Nope

499
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,878
If Martians exist, so do UFOs

500
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:36,548
Martians are...

501
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:40,145
What about real Zombies?
Scary Zombies

502
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:42,724
You think Santa Claus is real?

503
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:46,721
He is, he is

504
00:52:48,765 --> 00:52:52,565
You think?
There's only one Santa, right?

505
00:52:52,736 --> 00:52:56,365
He can't cover Japan
all by himself, can he?

506
00:52:56,773 --> 00:53:00,903
But he can
Santa Claus can manage it

507
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:02,979
That's right, there are all kinds...

508
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,817
Mother didn't come back. Did she?

509
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:54,216
Her work kept her away longer

510
00:54:57,193 --> 00:54:59,320
Because I was so mean to Mom?

511
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:01,021
No, that's not true

512
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:44,368
Hllo, this is the
Sanwa Department Store

513
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:47,533
May I speak to Fukushima Keiko
in Menswear?

514
00:55:47,644 --> 00:55:48,975
Excuse me...

515
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:50,306
This is her son

516
00:55:50,413 --> 00:55:52,313
Please hold a moment

517
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:06,721
I'm terribly sorry, but Ms. Fukushima
resigned last month

518
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:08,829
How may I help you?

519
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:33,155
How many minutes, Shigeru?

520
00:56:33,256 --> 00:56:34,587
Not yet

521
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,789
Not yet... how many more minutes?

522
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:40,294
One more minute, maybe

523
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:41,557
Maybe?

524
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:43,131
Maybe?

525
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:48,593
Not ready yet?

526
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,311
It's about ready, I think

527
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:00,610
You think?

528
00:57:01,618 --> 00:57:02,880
Let's eat. Then

529
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:05,915
Thanks for the food

530
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:07,990
Off you go, then

531
00:57:08,391 --> 00:57:09,858
Thanks for the food

532
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:15,693
I have to lick the lid

533
00:57:28,745 --> 00:57:29,734
Taste good?

534
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:31,307
Tastes good

535
00:57:31,414 --> 00:57:33,279
The super-duper best

536
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:18,486
Excuse me, I'm looking
for a phone number

537
00:58:19,762 --> 00:58:22,925
Kanagawa Prefecture,
Kawasaki City, Nakahara Ku...

538
00:58:40,316 --> 00:58:42,307
Hello, this is the Yamamotos

539
00:58:43,386 --> 00:58:47,345
Hello... Hello?

540
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:52,659
Wonder who this is
They aren't talking...

541
00:59:03,273 --> 00:59:06,765
Good evening
Have a happy new year

542
01:00:08,638 --> 01:00:10,071
Kyoko's next

543
01:00:11,841 --> 01:00:14,275
With the "kyo" like in Tok yo

544
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:27,783
Akira

545
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:35,554
That's right...

546
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:38,532
Mom sent us all
New Year's presents

547
01:00:39,535 --> 01:00:40,866
Look

548
01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:42,633
For you, Yuki

549
01:00:42,772 --> 01:00:43,830
Thank you

550
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:44,998
Shigeru

551
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:46,669
Kyoko

552
01:00:49,345 --> 01:00:50,369
That's for you

553
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,777

555
01:00:55,685 --> 01:00:59,917
4,000 Yen! No way
It's 2,000 Yen

556
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:02,255
1,000 Yen

557
01:01:03,893 --> 01:01:05,258
4,000 Yen

558
01:01:06,763 --> 01:01:08,162
4,000 Yen

559
01:01:09,866 --> 01:01:11,265
What do you want, Yuki?

560
01:01:11,367 --> 01:01:12,800
A doll

561
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:14,901
Shigeru?

562
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:16,266
Roller blades

563
01:01:16,372 --> 01:01:17,737
Roller blades?

564
01:01:21,711 --> 01:01:23,042
You, Kyoko?

565
01:01:23,146 --> 01:01:25,444
I'm saving mine up for a piano

566
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:27,740
You, brother?

567
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:30,316
A baseball glove

568
01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:05,010
No, I'm gonna meet
Mommy at the station

569
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:07,622
She's not coming home today

570
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:10,022
I'm sure she's coming home

571
01:02:10,993 --> 01:02:13,188
She'll be back next week

572
01:02:13,596 --> 01:02:15,826
She's really coming next week?

573
01:02:15,932 --> 01:02:17,365
She really will

574
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:18,826
How do you know?

575
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:20,163
I just do

576
01:02:25,508 --> 01:02:27,738
She's coming home next week

577
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:35,277
It's Yuki's birthday, today

578
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:08,140
These?

579
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:13,251
These?

580
01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:14,345
Yeah

581
01:03:30,106 --> 01:03:31,403
Just hang on

582
01:03:38,047 --> 01:03:39,241
OK, let's go

583
01:03:52,895 --> 01:03:54,385
Good evening

584
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:55,528
Good evening

585
01:03:55,631 --> 01:03:56,996
Stepping out?

586
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:58,660
Where to?

587
01:03:58,768 --> 01:04:00,895
To the station to meet my Mommy

588
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:03,733
I see, what's your name?

589
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:04,901
Yuki

590
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:07,942
Yuki, I see
How old are you, Yuki?

591
01:04:08,044 --> 01:04:08,908
I'm 5

592
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:11,002
5 years old? I see

593
01:04:11,647 --> 01:04:14,377
She's our cousin,
just staying overnight

594
01:04:14,483 --> 01:04:16,849
Oh, I see...
Off you go, then

595
01:04:16,953 --> 01:04:18,352
Off we go, then

596
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:22,150
Adorable little gir

597
01:04:23,659 --> 01:04:28,187
Tomato, daikon, broccoli,
squash, carrot...

598
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:29,321
There's so many

599
01:04:36,939 --> 01:04:40,340
Plates...
Cups...

600
01:04:42,511 --> 01:04:44,445
The butcher's...

601
01:05:13,476 --> 01:05:16,570
Oh, only one left?

602
01:05:20,783 --> 01:05:22,648
The last one

603
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:11,498
There's the monorail

604
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:07,989
It goes to Haneda Airport

605
01:07:09,992 --> 01:07:14,292
Someday let's get on
and go see the airplanes

606
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:19,732
Yeah, let's do that

607
01:08:47,756 --> 01:08:52,693
<i>Dear Kyoko</i>

608
01:08:52,862 --> 01:08:57,561
<i>To Kyoko</i>

609
01:11:15,973 --> 01:11:18,806
No, no, it turns on
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, idiot

610
01:11:18,909 --> 01:11:20,843
No, no, it's 1, 2, 3, 45, 6

611
01:11:20,945 --> 01:11:22,776
No. I swear it's on 5

612
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:25,542
No, I swear it's 6

613
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:27,618
Listen, listen, man

614
01:11:27,718 --> 01:11:31,051
You couldn't even do it on
that Kamehameha thing

615
01:11:31,355 --> 01:11:33,050
Yes I could

616
01:11:33,991 --> 01:11:36,755
Go! No, that's too far-ish

617
01:11:36,961 --> 01:11:38,724
Oh, damn you did it

618
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:42,625
You're a genius, man

619
01:11:43,567 --> 01:11:44,693
Using the brake?

620
01:11:44,802 --> 01:11:45,769
No brake

621
01:11:47,071 --> 01:11:48,732
Hey, wow, cool

622
01:11:50,241 --> 01:11:52,072
You gotta crash it

623
01:11:54,545 --> 01:11:58,037
That one already burned...

624
01:12:01,485 --> 01:12:02,816
We come

625
01:12:08,693 --> 01:12:09,921
Your friends?

626
01:12:10,561 --> 01:12:13,029
Yeah, friends

627
01:12:15,166 --> 01:12:17,361
That's 197 Yen

628
01:12:24,075 --> 01:12:25,337
Get off, get off

629
01:13:02,613 --> 01:13:03,773
Thanks

630
01:13:04,081 --> 01:13:05,139
Let's go

631
01:13:05,783 --> 01:13:06,715
Bye, then

632

633
01:13:11,922 --> 01:13:14,356
See you tomorrow
Bye, then

<i>Please indicate the desired amount</i>

635
01:13:27,438 --> 01:13:29,804

- Excuse us

637
01:14:04,809 --> 01:14:08,336
This one, huh?
Let's do it, let's do it

638
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:12,707
<i>Are you ready?
Start!</i>

639
01:14:17,621 --> 01:14:19,851
All right, perfect, max

What!

641
01:14:25,296 --> 01:14:26,490
Take that!

642
01:14:26,597 --> 01:14:28,588
What a weird haircut

643
01:14:31,001 --> 01:14:32,127
Coke and what?

644
01:14:32,236 --> 01:14:35,364
Coke and orange and...
CC Lemon

645
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:44,369
I'm home

646
01:14:44,482 --> 01:14:45,244
We bought stuff

647
01:14:45,349 --> 01:14:46,179
You're late

648
01:14:46,283 --> 01:14:48,308
How far'd you go?

649
01:14:49,353 --> 01:14:50,183
Coke for me

650
01:14:50,287 --> 01:14:51,311
Me, too

651
01:14:53,824 --> 01:14:56,292
Hey, somebody attacked

652
01:14:57,127 --> 01:14:59,459
Hey, you jerk, you let 'em in

653
01:14:59,563 --> 01:15:01,531
But this person attacked

654
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:05,965
<i>Your Gas Bill is Overdue</i>

655
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:08,968
Get away, you jerk

656
01:15:13,911 --> 01:15:16,539
OK, nice

657
01:15:21,819 --> 01:15:22,683
Go away

658
01:15:34,965 --> 01:15:37,126
Told you so, dammit

659
01:15:38,836 --> 01:15:41,270
You'll never get it that way

660
01:15:41,372 --> 01:15:42,999
Butt out

661
01:15:58,222 --> 01:15:59,314
Let's go to the store, Akira

662
01:15:59,423 --> 01:16:01,391
I'm hungry, treat us

663
01:16:01,492 --> 01:16:02,618
Sure

664
01:16:03,327 --> 01:16:04,419
Hey, I wanna go, too

665
01:16:04,528 --> 01:16:06,894
No, you stay home
Don't touch the game

666
01:16:07,031 --> 01:16:08,055
Don't touch it

667
01:16:20,311 --> 01:16:21,608
What are you doing?

668
01:16:53,744 --> 01:16:57,043
Hey, hey hey, isn't this great?

669
01:16:58,282 --> 01:17:01,877
Her tits are huge
Great, huh?

670
01:17:02,786 --> 01:17:05,653
Isn't it great?

671
01:17:21,797 --> 01:17:23,230
You swipe it?

672
01:17:25,101 --> 01:17:26,728
Your turn, Akira

673
01:17:31,173 --> 01:17:33,801
We're friends, right? Go

674
01:17:37,146 --> 01:17:38,272
Let's go

675
01:17:49,358 --> 01:17:50,655
Hey, wait

676
01:19:40,536 --> 01:19:42,163
He's not your type?

677
01:19:42,271 --> 01:19:46,071
No way! He's way too passionate-like
I like a cool-like guy

678
01:19:46,375 --> 01:19:48,536
But that's what's so cool

679
01:19:48,644 --> 01:19:49,668
Been a while

680
01:19:49,778 --> 01:19:50,676
Been a while

681
01:19:50,779 --> 01:19:51,837
How you been?

682
01:19:53,849 --> 01:19:55,544
Yeah, fine

683
01:19:57,186 --> 01:20:00,519
They're too big for me
They don't fit

684
01:20:00,856 --> 01:20:05,122
Mom says I'll grow any way,
so take the big ones

685
01:20:05,327 --> 01:20:06,794
I hate 'em

686
01:20:07,463 --> 01:20:08,452
Hey

687
01:20:10,866 --> 01:20:14,233
Been a while
How you been? What's up?

688
01:20:15,738 --> 01:20:19,037
Bought a new game,
why don't you come over?

689
01:20:23,612 --> 01:20:26,172
I'll come over
when I have time

690
01:20:28,250 --> 01:20:29,182
See you 'round

691
01:20:31,019 --> 01:20:33,954
I've got cram school, sorry

692
01:20:34,690 --> 01:20:35,657
See ya

693
01:20:35,758 --> 01:20:37,487
See ya, then

694
01:20:40,462 --> 01:20:41,793
Who was that?

695
01:20:44,566 --> 01:20:46,158
Take me along to play

696
01:20:46,668 --> 01:20:48,431
Yeah, but his house stinks

697
01:20:48,537 --> 01:20:51,233
No way, stinks of what?

698
01:20:51,874 --> 01:20:55,332
Stinks of garbage
The place is a real mess

699
01:20:55,444 --> 01:20:56,502
Like rotting?

700
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:01,508
Here she comes

701
01:21:55,103 --> 01:22:00,097
<i>To Mizuguchi Saki in Heaven</i>

702
01:22:21,230 --> 01:22:22,663
Got it

703
01:22:45,153 --> 01:22:48,782
Hello, there, Fukushima san

704
01:23:43,512 --> 01:23:45,377
Don't worry, he's gone

705
01:23:58,193 --> 01:23:59,524
How old are you?

706
01:23:59,628 --> 01:24:00,925
I'm 12

707
01:24:01,663 --> 01:24:05,656
You can't start working part-time
until you're 16

708
01:24:08,637 --> 01:24:13,040
Shouldn't you contact the police
or child welfare, or something?

709
01:24:14,910 --> 01:24:18,175
If I do, the four of us won't
be able to stay together

710
01:24:19,448 --> 01:24:22,576
That happened before
and it was an awful mess

711
01:24:23,318 --> 01:24:24,785
I see...

712
01:25:08,196 --> 01:25:09,823
You need it for your piano
It's OK

713
01:26:56,738 --> 01:26:58,069
Let's race

714
01:27:06,314 --> 01:27:08,475
Don't beat me, Akira

715
01:27:41,483 --> 01:27:42,916
We come

716
01:27:49,591 --> 01:27:51,456
Did your mother come back?

717
01:27:58,366 --> 01:28:03,235
Who's taller?
We're the same

718
01:28:55,190 --> 01:28:57,181
There are seeds here, too

719
01:28:58,927 --> 01:28:59,916
Take them

720
01:29:00,395 --> 01:29:01,919
I'll take these, too

721
01:29:02,030 --> 01:29:06,399
OK, I'll take these
Look, Akira, seeds

722
01:29:07,602 --> 01:29:10,867
Somebody just left them behind

723
01:29:11,539 --> 01:29:13,268
Poor things

724
01:29:20,048 --> 01:29:22,016
2, 3, 4, 5...

725
01:29:22,117 --> 01:29:24,244
Amazing, for real

726
01:29:24,819 --> 01:29:26,582
Paper, scissors, rock

727
01:29:29,291 --> 01:29:32,852
F rst is rock
Paper, scissors, rock

728
01:29:34,362 --> 01:29:36,125
I can't stop

729
01:29:54,282 --> 01:29:56,341
Akira, got dirt?

730
01:29:56,651 --> 01:29:57,743
Got it

731
01:30:07,462 --> 01:30:08,554
Shige!

732
01:30:53,041 --> 01:30:54,235
Shigeru!

733
01:30:56,044 --> 01:30:57,306
Shigeru

734
01:30:59,447 --> 01:31:00,744
Hey, Shigeru

735
01:31:01,049 --> 01:31:02,175
The bag

736
01:31:24,372 --> 01:31:26,806
It came out funny

737
01:31:33,448 --> 01:31:34,540
Yu...

738
01:31:39,888 --> 01:31:40,946
ki...

739
01:31:46,227 --> 01:31:48,252
I'll go get some water

740
01:32:07,615 --> 01:32:10,482
Brother, the lights don't work

741
01:32:28,269 --> 01:32:30,100
Not in the bathroom, either

742
01:33:53,821 --> 01:33:57,086
Mr. String, Mr. String,
where are you?

743
01:34:28,990 --> 01:34:30,651
What are you doing?

744
01:34:33,561 --> 01:34:35,392
Not going to school?

745
01:34:35,563 --> 01:34:36,655
No...

746
01:34:37,265 --> 01:34:39,062
I'm not either

747
01:34:50,712 --> 01:34:54,113
There's a cicada hole here,
did you know?

748
01:34:54,349 --> 01:34:55,816
No, I didn't

749
01:35:00,188 --> 01:35:02,088
And again

750
01:35:04,592 --> 01:35:07,720

753
01:35:21,276 --> 01:35:24,404
First is rock
Paper, scissors, rock

754
01:35:25,246 --> 01:35:27,009
And again!

755
01:36:20,168 --> 01:36:25,162
<i>We have suspended
your water service</i>

756
01:38:24,725 --> 01:38:27,193

757
01:38:27,295 --> 01:38:28,592
Wow, amazing

758
01:38:47,782 --> 01:38:49,249
What are you doing?

759
01:38:50,184 --> 01:38:51,776
Nothing special

760
01:38:53,754 --> 01:38:55,722
Did you catch cold?

761
01:38:57,191 --> 01:38:58,681
Your voice sounds weird

762
01:38:58,993 --> 01:39:00,551
Shut up

763
01:39:21,649 --> 01:39:23,412
Are you washing your hair?

764
01:39:24,819 --> 01:39:26,480
Yesterday, at the park

765
01:39:50,111 --> 01:39:51,476
Nice and cool?

766
01:40:04,458 --> 01:40:06,323
When's your mother coming back?

767
01:40:07,128 --> 01:40:08,686
She's never coming back

768
01:40:13,067 --> 01:40:14,159
Probably

769
01:41:26,909 --> 01:41:30,072
I'm not hot
I'm hot

770
01:41:33,950 --> 01:41:36,282
I said, I'm not hot, I'm not

771
01:41:38,988 --> 01:41:40,387
Thank you

772
01:42:09,685 --> 01:42:11,585

773
01:42:19,562 --> 01:42:20,722
Shigeru

774
01:42:25,334 --> 01:42:26,665
No salmon?

775
01:42:26,769 --> 01:42:29,101
No, just what's there

776
01:42:29,505 --> 01:42:30,938
No fair

777
01:42:50,192 --> 01:42:53,218
This was Shigeru's
It died

778
01:43:13,582 --> 01:43:15,015
She fell asleep

779
01:43:29,098 --> 01:43:33,091
Excuse me. The door was unlocked...

780
01:43:35,938 --> 01:43:39,135
I'm the landlord from the 3rd floor,
here about the rent

781
01:43:40,176 --> 01:43:41,768
Where's your mother?

782
01:43:42,712 --> 01:43:45,875
She's working in Osaka

783
01:43:48,951 --> 01:43:51,215
Are you cousins?

784
01:44:28,991 --> 01:44:30,618
I'll go make some money

785
01:44:30,726 --> 01:44:32,591
What? How?

786
01:45:38,360 --> 01:45:39,019
Here!

787
01:45:39,128 --> 01:45:40,026
No

788
01:45:40,529 --> 01:45:43,430
Why not?
Just sang karaoke with him

789
01:45:43,732 --> 01:45:44,824
No!

790
01:47:21,330 --> 01:47:22,820
What are you eating?

791
01:47:24,166 --> 01:47:25,394
Spit it out

792
01:47:30,005 --> 01:47:31,438
What is that?

793
01:47:34,310 --> 01:47:35,675
Paper

794
01:47:47,723 --> 01:47:49,953
That's 287 Yen

795
01:47:56,198 --> 01:47:58,029
Exactly, thank you

796
01:48:00,502 --> 01:48:02,402
How'd the semester go?

797
01:48:02,504 --> 01:48:06,600
His report card, you mean?
A total disaster

798
01:48:06,709 --> 01:48:10,611
He got a terrible grade in Japanese

799
01:48:10,713 --> 01:48:12,977
My child did badly, too

800
01:48:34,670 --> 01:48:36,535
Wish I could find something

801
01:49:04,867 --> 01:49:06,334
Hey, where's Shigeru?

802
01:49:07,269 --> 01:49:08,634
Dunno

803
01:49:18,280 --> 01:49:20,009
What are you doing?

804
01:49:20,783 --> 01:49:22,114
Where's Shigeru?

805
01:49:22,217 --> 01:49:23,445
Dunno

806
01:49:57,920 --> 01:49:58,978
Shige!

807
01:50:01,323 --> 01:50:04,156
You said you wanted noodles
so I got some!

808
01:50:04,259 --> 01:50:05,419
What do you want!

809
01:50:05,994 --> 01:50:07,621
You watch it, buster

810
01:50:08,997 --> 01:50:10,430
Don't bother coming home

811
01:50:10,532 --> 01:50:12,432
Don't take it out on things

812
01:50:21,176 --> 01:50:22,370
Did it break?

813
01:50:24,847 --> 01:50:26,246
Amazing power

814
01:50:26,348 --> 01:50:28,441
He's just an idiot

815
01:52:49,491 --> 01:52:51,186
Cut it out, Yuki

816
01:52:52,160 --> 01:52:54,253
I have to pee

817
01:52:55,063 --> 01:52:57,793
Why didn't you pee
in the park, before?

818
01:52:59,167 --> 01:53:00,691
Go pee by the bath

819
01:53:01,670 --> 01:53:02,830
Don't want to

820
01:53:10,846 --> 01:53:13,212
Is Saki coming back?

821
01:53:32,467 --> 01:53:35,834
Shigeru! You can't just
use up all the water!

822
01:53:36,872 --> 01:53:38,840
There's none left to drink

823
01:53:45,747 --> 01:53:47,840
Is Saki coming to play again?

824
01:53:47,950 --> 01:53:49,008
Never

825
01:54:11,473 --> 01:54:12,838
What are you doing?

826
01:54:14,242 --> 01:54:15,800
I'm selling these

827
01:54:18,380 --> 01:54:19,711
Don't need 'em anymore

828
01:54:20,716 --> 01:54:21,978
Stop it

829
01:54:22,084 --> 01:54:23,051
Cut it out

830
01:54:23,151 --> 01:54:24,516
Let go!

831
01:54:24,620 --> 01:54:25,609
Shut up!

832
01:54:26,021 --> 01:54:27,386
Move

833
01:54:28,590 --> 01:54:30,114
Don't touch it!

834
01:54:36,398 --> 01:54:38,127
She's never coming back

835
01:54:42,404 --> 01:54:46,067
Who cares! Stay in there!
Idiot!

836
01:55:28,917 --> 01:55:33,183
Miyauchi!
Don't move your legs too much!

837
01:55:43,498 --> 01:55:47,229

838
01:55:47,335 --> 01:55:48,597

839

Oh, man, we're short

840

Bow

846
01:56:41,256 --> 01:56:42,814
Let's go!

847
01:57:26,201 --> 01:57:30,934
Akira, hold your hands closer,
like this...

848
01:57:31,339 --> 01:57:35,673
When the ball comes,
take a real hard slice at it, wham

849
01:57:35,777 --> 01:57:37,745
Just, wham, swing at it

850
01:57:46,454 --> 01:57:48,615
That's fine, nice swing...

851
01:57:48,723 --> 01:57:54,025

Yuki

854
01:59:06,067 --> 01:59:07,466
Yuki won't get up

855
01:59:09,838 --> 01:59:11,032
Yuki!

856
01:59:14,042 --> 01:59:15,805
She fell off the chair

857
01:59:25,754 --> 01:59:26,948
Yes, hello?

858
01:59:27,055 --> 01:59:28,989
Is Fukushima Keiko there?

859
01:59:29,324 --> 01:59:31,656
Just a minute.
I'll go get her

860
02:00:44,065 --> 02:00:47,557

861
02:01:41,890 --> 02:01:46,350

864

So surprised...

Akira

867
02:02:38,513 --> 02:02:39,810
What happened?

868
02:02:49,257 --> 02:02:51,987
That money...
Can I borrow it?

869
02:02:54,762 --> 02:02:57,993
I want to show Yuki...

870
02:03:10,512 --> 02:03:15,040

Looks like fun

871
02:03:16,084 --> 02:03:18,712

872
02:03:22,056 --> 02:03:23,717

878
02:06:11,993 --> 02:06:13,722

879
02:10:54,075 --> 02:10:56,635
When I touched Yuki
this morning...

880
02:10:58,879 --> 02:11:01,541
she was so cold, it was awful

881
02:11:08,089 --> 02:11:10,057
It just felt so...

882
02:11:13,527 --> 02:11:15,995
