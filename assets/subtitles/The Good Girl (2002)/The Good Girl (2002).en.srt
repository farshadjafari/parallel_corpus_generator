00:43:31,573 --> 00:43:33,871
we forgot
the Bibles, Justine.

719
00:43:33,975 --> 00:43:36,500
Well, that's all right,
they'll forgive us.

720
00:43:37,779 --> 00:43:39,974

721
00:43:40,081 --> 00:43:41,776
Hey there, people.

722
00:43:41,883 --> 00:43:43,373
Glad you could make it.

723
00:43:43,485 --> 00:43:44,543
Hi, Corny.

724
00:43:44,652 --> 00:43:45,550
This is my husband--

Howdy, Phil.

Y'all are in for a treat.

728
00:43:49,424 --> 00:43:51,654
We got a good discussion
planned for tonight.

729
00:43:51,759 --> 00:43:53,226
If man is made
in God's image...

730
00:43:53,328 --> 00:43:56,195
what does that
say about God?

731
00:43:56,297 --> 00:43:58,765
Yeah, that sounds
like a good one, man.

732
00:43:58,867 --> 00:44:00,960
Hey, Brandon,
I want to talk to you

733
00:44:01,069 --> 00:44:03,264
about the casting of
Pilgrim's Progress.

734
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,178
Phil, come
with me to the car.

735
00:44:13,281 --> 00:44:14,339
What?

736
00:44:14,449 --> 00:44:16,815
Come with me to the car.
I got to get something.

737

738

Get in the car.

739
00:44:23,925 --> 00:44:25,859
Just get
in the car, Phil.

740
00:44:29,764 --> 00:44:30,992
What the hell?

741
00:44:31,099 --> 00:44:32,999
I don't want
to go to Bible study.

742
00:44:33,101 --> 00:44:34,193
Why not?

743
00:44:34,302 --> 00:44:35,792
Because I don't want to.

744
00:44:35,904 --> 00:44:38,134
Now let's just
get out of here.

745
00:44:38,239 --> 00:44:40,332
Justine,
this is embarrassing.

746
00:44:40,441 --> 00:44:41,840
We're running away
from Bible study

747
00:44:41,943 --> 00:44:43,604
like a couple of
devil worshipers.

748
00:44:43,711 --> 00:44:46,271
I don't care.
I'm not in the mood.

749
00:44:46,381 --> 00:44:49,282
You are
freaking me out, man.

750
00:44:49,384 --> 00:44:50,681
Why?

751
00:44:50,785 --> 00:44:52,309
Why?

752
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:56,117
Because we forgot
our Bibles is why.

753
00:44:56,224 --> 00:44:57,418
You just said 2 seconds ago

754
00:44:57,525 --> 00:44:59,823
they'd forgive us.

755
00:44:59,928 --> 00:45:01,919
Well, they may not,
all right?

756
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:04,794
So can we please just
get the shit out of here?

757
00:45:04,899 --> 00:45:05,888
All right.

758
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,729
I'm never going back
to Bible study again.

759
00:45:07,835 --> 00:45:09,234
I can tell you that much.

760
00:45:09,337 --> 00:45:11,669
I don't care.
Fine by me. Let's just go.

don't you think?

762
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:24,741
Not at all. I'm just trying
to match your face with your hair.

763
00:45:24,852 --> 00:45:26,752
I was thinking
you're not white enough.

764
00:45:26,854 --> 00:45:29,220
I think I look
kind of weird.

765
00:45:29,324 --> 00:45:31,224
The first rule of fashion

766
00:45:31,326 --> 00:45:32,884
is you have to look weird.

767
00:45:32,994 --> 00:45:35,485
What I'm doing has come
straight here from France.

768
00:45:35,597 --> 00:45:36,655
Oh?

769
00:45:36,764 --> 00:45:38,095
It's called Cirque du Face...

770
00:45:38,199 --> 00:45:39,689
meaning
"Circus of the Face,"

771
00:45:39,801 --> 00:45:41,996
and it's all the rage
with the Frenchies, ma'am.

Well, you're
the professional.

what happened to you?

776
00:45:50,878 --> 00:45:52,607
I looked over,
and I saw you two driving off

777
00:45:52,714 --> 00:45:53,772

Well, you could have just
looked on with your neighbor.

bumping your nut on a Bible.

Well, we felt bad.

that I have to tend to.

791
00:46:21,509 --> 00:46:23,875
I thought you said
we'd go today.

792
00:46:23,978 --> 00:46:26,708
Yeah, something came up.

Well, what?
What came up?

794
00:46:30,184 --> 00:46:32,618
OK, look, uh--

795
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,881
I think, um, maybe...

796
00:46:34,989 --> 00:46:37,514
somebody has found out about us.

797
00:46:41,029 --> 00:46:44,430
Well, I'm starting to wonder
if you even want to go.

798
00:46:46,034 --> 00:46:48,366
I'm starting to think
you don't get me.

You do! You do get me!

You just don't
want to get me...

802
00:47:07,689 --> 00:47:09,714
because I'm
too intensified for you.

803
00:47:09,824 --> 00:47:11,587
Justine, who cares--

804
00:47:11,693 --> 00:47:13,126
Who cares
if someone found out?

805

live like this, Justine.

Bubba sat like that

844
00:49:24,225 --> 00:49:27,991
for what seemed like 10 years
before he began to speak.

845
00:49:28,095 --> 00:49:29,892
Finally,
when he opened his mouth...

846
00:49:29,997 --> 00:49:31,021
he talked a blue streak

847
00:49:31,132 --> 00:49:34,431
about the sad ruin
that was his life.

848
00:49:34,535 --> 00:49:36,400
He talked about
how he loved Phil...

849
00:49:36,504 --> 00:49:37,801
and how he loved me...

850
00:49:37,905 --> 00:49:40,465
and how he always wanted
a girlfriend just like me

851
00:49:40,575 --> 00:49:42,073
and to be a guy like Phil

852
00:49:42,176 --> 00:49:46,670
to this imaginary girl
like me who he never found.

853
00:49:46,781 --> 00:49:49,341
Then he started on about
giving up your dreams

854
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:51,884
and how it's all a part
of getting older.

855
00:49:51,986 --> 00:49:55,319
Bubba had given up
his dream of being Phil.

856
00:49:55,423 --> 00:49:58,483
He had accepted his fate
of being Bubba...

857

858
00:50:01,028 --> 00:50:02,655

a door that had
always been shut

swung wide open.

861
00:50:15,776 --> 00:50:19,007
Bubba felt that this
was no chance coincidence.

862
00:50:19,113 --> 00:50:22,879
A cosmic force was at work.

863
00:50:22,984 --> 00:50:25,452
The sounds of me making love
to a man who wasn't Phil

864
00:50:25,553 --> 00:50:27,214
was like
a shout in Bubba's ear

from the Creator himself.

What it meant,
or what to do or why...

Bubba didn't know.

868
00:50:41,068 --> 00:50:42,729
All he knew
was that he hated me

869
00:50:42,837 --> 00:50:44,668
for poisoning
the well of idealism

870
00:50:44,772 --> 00:50:47,138
from which he had drunk
for so long.

871
00:50:47,241 --> 00:50:51,041
I was no longer Bubba's image
of perfection.

872
00:50:51,145 --> 00:50:53,773
I was just
a liar and a whore...

873
00:50:53,881 --> 00:50:57,373
and that sickened him.

874
00:50:57,485 --> 00:50:58,543
But on the other hand...

875
00:50:58,653 --> 00:51:00,382
he loved me
for opening his eyes

876
00:51:00,488 --> 00:51:02,752
and releasing him from
the bitter chains of envy

877
00:51:02,857 --> 00:51:05,758
that bound him to Phil.

878
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:07,088
Phil was no Superman...

879
00:51:07,194 --> 00:51:09,128
just a cuckold and a fool...

880
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:11,391
and that was beautiful.

00:51:15,603 --> 00:51:16,570

just one thing
left for us to do...

solve both of our problems

Sometimes to get back
on the road to redemption...

1079
01:00:17,211 --> 01:00:20,009

a few pit stops.

1080

1081

living day-to-day.

and we just got to stick--

1088

1089
01:00:44,304 --> 01:00:45,896

1090

thinking about it instead.

What was that for?

1100

They looked dirty.

1101

in them or something.

1102
01:01:59,713 --> 01:02:00,941
Son, I understood
your history.

1103
01:02:01,048 --> 01:02:03,516
Your father gave me a call,
I gave you a job.

1104
01:02:03,617 --> 01:02:04,948
I even let you
use that name...

1105
01:02:05,052 --> 01:02:05,950
even though
it isn't yours...

1106
01:02:06,053 --> 01:02:06,985

1107

in the store, so--

1108
01:02:17,197 --> 01:02:20,598
I'm worried
about Holden--Tom.

1109
01:02:20,701 --> 01:02:23,534
I'm--I'm
worried about Tom.

1110
01:02:23,637 --> 01:02:27,596
I just befriended
Tom recently...

1111
01:02:27,708 --> 01:02:31,041
and now...

1112
01:02:31,144 --> 01:02:33,374
well...

1113
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:36,506
I think
he's mentally ill.

1114
01:02:36,617 --> 01:02:38,744
He's got this idea
in his head

1115
01:02:38,852 --> 01:02:41,047
that we've had
some sort of affair--

1116
01:02:41,154 --> 01:02:42,519
which is crazy...

1117
01:02:42,623 --> 01:02:44,250
because
I'm--I'm married--

1118
01:02:44,358 --> 01:02:45,723
And--And he said--

1119
01:02:45,826 --> 01:02:48,056
He's been saying
all sorts of strange things

1120
01:02:48,161 --> 01:02:50,629
and making threats...

1121
01:02:50,731 --> 01:02:53,461
and drinkin'...

1122
01:02:53,567 --> 01:02:54,556
and...

1123
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:01,166
and I just think

1124
01:03:01,274 --> 01:03:03,708
he would be better off
someplace where people--

1125
01:03:03,810 --> 01:03:05,801
professionals--

1126
01:03:05,912 --> 01:03:08,107

Otherwise, I--I--I--

1128
01:03:09,916 --> 01:03:12,544

himself into trouble.

1129

doing in there?

1130

Why are you taking it?

1133
01:03:45,285 --> 01:03:48,083

gotten my period.

taken it yet.

Bright blue.

1143
01:04:27,894 --> 01:04:30,488

could be wrong, Phil.
