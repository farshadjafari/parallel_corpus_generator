1
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,435
Get up, girl. Get up!

2
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:31,948
Whoa!

3
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:50,967
Little Josey!

4
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:56,556
Come on in. Let's get you cleaned up.

5
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,477
Better go.

6
00:01:13,157 --> 00:01:14,699
Whoa.

7
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:16,260
Pa! Help!
Josey!

8
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:19,430
Josey! No, no!

9
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,308
Josey! No!

10
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,019
Josey!

11
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:28,105
Josey! No!

12
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,399
Josey! No!

13
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:33,569
Pa! Pa!

14
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:37,365
No!
Pa!

15
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:09,415
Ashes to ashes...

16
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,669
...dust to dust...

17
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:17,506
...the Lord gives...

18
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,552
...the Lord takes away.

19
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:24,633
The name's Anderson.

20
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,555
Bloody Bill is what they call me.

21
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,062
Redlegs?

22
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,483
You'll find them up in Kansas.

23
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,652
They're with the Union.

24
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,907
And we're going up there
and set things aright.

25
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:54,371
I'll be coming with you.

26
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,386
All that a fellow has to do...

27
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:41,223
...is ride into that Union camp
down there...

28
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:47,021
...raise his right hand and swear
you'll be loyal to the United States.

29
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,816
Then he can take up his horse again...

30
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,235
...and go home.

31
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,908
They'll give us full amnesty then?

32
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:02,619
Yep.

33
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,415
Everyone else has done it but us.

34
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,753
We're the last of the holdouts.

35
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,475
I'm going in. I've had enough.

36
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,819
Josey?

37
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,866
Better go with them, boy.

38
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:44,346
You coming with us?

39
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,643
I reckon not, Fletcher.

40
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:51,687
They'll be coming after you.

41
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:54,940
Yep.

42
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,026
There's nowhere to go to get away.

43
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:02,865
I reckon that's true.

44
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:09,371
Well, good luck.

45
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,965
Put the rifle down too.

46
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,969
- I'll need it for squirrels and such.
- Put it down.

47
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:56,353
Kind of young, ain't you kid,
to be riding with this rabble?

48
00:14:56,813 --> 00:15:00,691
Who you calling rabble,
you blue scumbelly?

49
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:06,405
Hell, we showed these boys, anyway.

50
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:09,199
Lee might have had to surrender,
but we didn't.

51
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,159
- Shut up, kid.
- Yes, sir.

52
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,911
You showed us.

53
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:14,663
Now get in line...

54
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:17,833
...before I kick you so hard
you'll wear your ass for a hat.

55
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,304
Here's the man you asked for, sir.

56
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:33,515
- Fletcher. Good to see you.
- Senator.

57
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:34,808
Well done.

58
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:36,101
Thank you.

59
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,733
What the hell is
this Redleg doing here?

60
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,030
You said regular federal authorities
would handle this.

61
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:52,618
Captain Terrill is the regular
federal authority now.

62
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:56,455
Captain Terrill is
a bloodthirsty son of a bitch!

63
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:58,957
He is a looter and a pillager!

64
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,917
He's the worst enemy those men have!

65
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,838
The war's over.

66
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:08,216
Our side won the war.

67
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,887
Now we must busy ourselves
winning the peace.

68
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:16,892
And, Fletcher, there's an old saying:
To the victors belong the spoils.

69
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:26,777
And there's another old saying, senator.

70
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:30,072
Don't piss down my back
and tell me it's raining.

71
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:33,492
Which side is this man on, senator?

72
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:35,911
Easy. He brought them all in, didn't he?

73
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,954
- All but one.
- Who's that?

74
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:39,956
Josey Wales.

75
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,419
Josey Wales.

76
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:54,930
Captain Terrill, I want you to
currycomb the countryside.

77
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:58,433
You beat the brush and root out
everything disloyal...

78
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:02,104
...from a Shanghai rooster
to a Durham cow!

79
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:05,315
We've got to clean up this country.

80
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:10,821
Now you take five men and go up there
and get Josey Wales.

81
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:17,828
Captain Redlegs Terrill and five men
against Josey Wales?

82
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:22,999
We stopped those bushwhackers
pretty good during the war.

83
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:27,921
Fletcher, you go with Captain Terrill.

84
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:31,466
Bring in this damn
insurrectionist rebel.

85
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:33,635
Now, here.

86
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,471
Here's the money for bringing
the others...

87
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:39,307
...and there'll be more for Josey Wales.

88
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:48,191
I've had enough of your money, senator.

89
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,485
Let Wales be.

90
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,237
Let me be.

91
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:54,948
I'm finished with you.

92
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,252
All right...

93
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:13,008
...I want you men to raise
your right hands.

94
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,509
What for?

95
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:18,180
So you can pledge loyalty
to the Union.

96
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:21,183
Hell, pledge loyalty to the Union?

97
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:23,852
You ought to have us turn around
and bend over.

98
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,566
All raise your right hands
so I can take your oath.

99
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:32,569
I pledge...

100
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:36,364
...that I will be loyal to
the United States of America.

101
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:39,201
I pledge that I will be loyal...

102
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:42,120
...to the United States of America.

103
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,748
That I will...

104
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:49,127
Let's see. I will abide by its law...

105
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,463
...that I will never bear arms against it.

106
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,715
I will abide by its law...

107
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:57,302
...that I will never bear arms
against it.

108
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,889
And recognize...

109
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:03,558
...that it is one nation.

110
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,061
And recognize...

111
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,729
...that it is one nation.

112
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:09,731
- I ain't doing it.
Come on, kid.

113
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:12,108
Let's get this over with, damn it!

114
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,944
But I been thinking.

115
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:17,113
I think it's them who owes an apology.

116
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:20,450
And I further swear, that though...

117
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:21,743
...I be murderous...

118
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,081
Look! That's Josey!

119
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:34,089
Verminous, lying, Missouri scum!

120
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,623
Damn you, senator!

121
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,460
You promised me those men would be
decently treated.

122
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,963
They were decently treated.

123
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,299
They were decently fed...

124
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:19,634
...and then they were decently shot.

125
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:22,804
These men are common outlaws,
nothing more.

126
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:27,243
Run for it, Fletcher, it's a trap!

127
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,887
Josey, we best be on our way.

128
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,723
- Get moving, boy.
- They're coming after us.

129
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:50,767
We've got to take to the brush!

130
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,269
- You get going!
- You can't get them all.

131
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,398
- That's a fact.
- How come you're doing this then?

132
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,609
I've got nothing better to do.

133
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:02,404
Fletcher was in with them.
It was a trap!

134
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:04,781
Fletcher?

135
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:07,409
Never would have figured that.

136
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:15,208
You dumb kid.

137
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:18,837
Josey, I've got to tell you something.

138
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:21,506
I'm scared of dying.

139
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:23,508
Move out!

140
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,625
You are going after him after all.

141
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:00,628
Fletcher, I'm giving you a commission.

142
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:04,966
Hound this Wales to kingdom come.

143
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,136
Hound him, senator?

144
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:12,140
A man like Wales lives by the feud.

145
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:16,644
Because of what you did here today,
I've got to kill that man.

146
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:20,482
Well, he'll have to run for it now.

147
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:24,027
And hell is where he's headed.

148
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:27,489
He'll be waiting there for us, senator.

149
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:35,163
Don't hold back on account
of me. I can ride.

150
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:39,334
I ain't holding back on account of you,
you thick-headed grasshopper.

151
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:44,172
If we ride in the open, there's enough
posses over in South Missouri...

152
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,382
...to start another war.

153
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:49,427
And if we try riding
instead of thinking...

154
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:53,890
...well, we'll end up hanging
by a rope by nightfall.

155
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:57,435
- Where are we headed?
- The Indian Nations.

156
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:01,022
It's a good place to hole up
and get you healed up.

157
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:02,690
Then we'll go get Fletcher?

158
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:06,069
Right, boy.

159
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:09,030
Then we go back and get Fletcher.

160
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:22,627
There's some riders
coming up behind us.

161
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:58,454
Get down here, boy.
Lay across his neck.

162
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,373
Keep him down there.

163
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,432
Can you hear me, boy?

164
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:22,103
Now if you see me get up,
you stay there, understand?

165
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:24,480
If you hear shooting
and me headed back north...

166
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:27,275
...get back on that horse.
He'll get up with you...

167
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,611
...and you head south, now you hear?

168
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,704
Whoa. Whoa.

169
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:48,963
You can let him up now, boy.

170
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:51,549
Let him up!

171
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,302
Get up, goddamn it!

172
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,017
Whupped them again, didn't we?

173
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:05,021
Whupped them again, boy.

174
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:20,203
Ten years I've been ferrying
Kansas Redlegs...

175
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:23,665
...Union Cavalry, Missouri guerrillas...

176
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:25,541
...you name it!

177
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,752
Mad dogs, them guerrillas!

178
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,213
You look sideways at them...

179
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:32,090
...they kill you!

180
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,842
Hard men to do business with.

181
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:36,386
You bet!

182
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:38,596
You know, in my line of work...

183
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:42,350
...you got to be able either to sing
"The Battle Hymn of the Republic"...

184
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,603
...or "Dixie" with equal enthusiasm...

185
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,564
...depending upon present company.

186
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:52,110
Can't say as I blame you for that.

187
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:55,363
Only good business to play it safe.

188
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:58,408
Thank God they all been disarmed now...

189
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,868
...except for a few of the nastiest ones...

190
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,496
...who they're busy running down.

191
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:07,125
Where I'm going,
they know how to handle that kind.

192
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,210
Where are you headed?

193
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,587
I'm going to ply
my wares down in Texas.

194
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:14,215
Texas, huh?

195
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:17,885
How much for the ferry ride?

196
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:19,762
Ten cents.

197
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:24,726
By coincidence, I happen to have
a bottle of this remarkable elixir...

198
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:26,894
...I could let you have
for that exact amount.

199
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:29,605
I wish I was in the land of cotton

200
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,567
Old times there is not forgotten

201
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:35,236
Look away, look away

202
00:27:35,446 --> 00:27:37,780
Look away, Dixieland

203
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:41,242
- Howdy.
- Howdy there.

204
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,745
Sim Carstairs is the name.

205
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:45,079
Mister...?

206
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:48,082
Figured we'd give you some
ferrying business.

207
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,752
With pleasure!

208
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:55,757
Bill Quantrill used this ferry
all the time.

209
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:57,800
Good friend of mine.

210
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,094
What have you got there?

211
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:04,557
Just the store with
Grannie Hawkins up there.

212
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,643
I'll tell you what.

213
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,688
We'll all just amble
over to that store.

214
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,691
Him and me will ride.
We've got a touch of the cramp.

215
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,276
Stranger, you're in luck!

216
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:18,488
I just happen to have the perfect thing
here for cramps.

217
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:22,450
We'll need half a side of bacon...

218
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:26,454
...10 pounds of beef jerky,
20 pounds of horse grain.

219
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:30,458
And when we get over there, there won't
be any need for you to go inside.

220
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:34,629
Just tell Old Grannie through the door
we'll need a lot of clean bandages...

221
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:39,008
...and a boiled poultice for a
bullet wound in a hurry. Come on.

222
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:56,359
So you'll be Josey Wales.

223
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,738
How might you know that, Grannie?

224
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,491
Soldiers were here looking
for you two hours ago.

225
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:08,329
I was going to mention that to you
as soon as I got the chance.

226
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:10,331
They say you killed your own men.

227
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:12,750
Those lying blue scumbellies!

228
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:16,045
They say you're a hard-put
and desperate man.

229
00:29:17,131 --> 00:29:20,007
They're going to heel and hog you
to a barn door.

230
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:24,679
- You know what I say?
- What's that?

231
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,682
I say that big talk's worth diddlysquat.

232
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:32,019
Now them poultices be laced with
feather moss and mustard root.

233
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:35,857
Mind you drop water on them
occasionally and keep them damp.

234
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:37,900
Much obliged, Grannie.

235
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:41,404
You can pay me when you see me again,
Josey Wales.

236
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,867
I reckon so.

237
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,414
There's buckwheat cakes
And injun batter

238
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:54,792
Makes you fat or a little fatter

239
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:59,672
Look away, look away, look away
Dixieland

240
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:05,303
That sure is a sweet sound
to the ears...

241
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:07,805
...wouldn't you say so, Mr. Wales?

242
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:10,057
Your young friend can use some help.

243
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:12,059
This is it. One dollar a bottle.

244
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:14,437
It works wonders on wounds.

245
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,731
Works wonders on
just about everything.

246
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,066
It can do most anything.

247
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:22,778
How is it with stains?

248
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,586
Here we go.

249
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:44,008
Come on, come on. Yeah.

250
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,928
Yeah.

251
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:55,811
Dismount. Disembark, children.

252
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:58,773
Get that back!

253
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,525
Bring it back!

254
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:03,444
Bring that barge back!

255
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:06,113
Bring it back!

256
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:08,241
Whupped them again, Josey.

257
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:10,785
They're hollering for me to come over!

258
00:31:11,245 --> 00:31:13,246
I can't hold on.

259
00:31:13,956 --> 00:31:17,625
But I'll hold on until you fellows
get out of sight.

260
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:19,335
All right?

261
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:21,629
I'll make do something's wrong-

262
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,297
Pull, Lemuel. Pull!

263
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:27,134
I'll make do something's wrong,
until you get going.

264
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:30,638
I wish you all lots of luck.

265
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,266
Pull, Lemuel, pull!

266
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:37,812
Oh I wish I was in the land of cotton

267
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,897
He ain't going to hold up no ferry.

268
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:43,276
He's going to bring that cavalry
over fast as he can.

269
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:45,152
Yeah.

270
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:49,198
Reckon there's a nice reward out
for us about now.

271
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:55,329
Mine eyes have seen the glory
Of the coming of the Lord

272
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:58,666
He is trampling out the vintage...

273
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:01,544
We got him now.

274
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:04,422
We'll get those two first,
then the others.

275
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:06,007
What others?

276
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,342
Wales and the kid are the last ones.

277
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:12,013
Oh, no. Texas is full of rebels.

278
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:14,223
Lots of work to do down in Texas.

279
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:16,851
We get Josey Wales and it ends.

280
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,187
Doing right ain't got no end.

281
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:28,696
We best hurry on, Josey.

282
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:32,366
They'd catch up to us
by the end of the day.

283
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:35,077
Judging by these tracks,
there's maybe...

284
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,872
...40, 50 horses ahead of us.

285
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:42,126
What we've got to do is space some time
between them and us.

286
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,879
What are we going to do?

287
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,632
Stay right here.

288
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,469
Welcome.

289
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,930
Welcome, gentlemen.
Please come aboard.

290
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,433
Howdy.

291
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:08,778
Pull, Lemuel.

292
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,155
- He's still there.
Still there?

293
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,407
What does he think he's doing?

294
00:33:14,076 --> 00:33:15,409
Don't know.

295
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:18,245
Some of you men get down there.
Prepare to fire.

296
00:33:20,082 --> 00:33:21,624
Captain Redlegs...

297
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:24,001
...I advise you to turn back.

298
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,920
You can catch him later.

299
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,923
Turn back? Are you crazy?

300
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:31,133
He'll try to pick us off one by one.

301
00:33:32,094 --> 00:33:33,386
He'll never do it.

302
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:35,596
At best, he'll get two
or three up front.

303
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:42,395
- I advise you to turn back, captain.
- They're coming.

304
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:11,298
Do you really think you can shoot
all those men down...

305
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:13,342
...before they shoot you?

306
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:17,304
Oh, no, no, Mr. Josey Wales!

307
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:21,475
There is such a thing in this country
called justice.

308
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:26,063
Well, Mr. Carpetbagger...

309
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,983
...we've got something in this territory...

310
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:33,028
...called the Missouri boat ride.

311
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,666
Watch out! Back him up!

312
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:57,219
God Almighty!

313
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:06,979
Watch out for that horse!
Watch out, you stupid son of a bitch!

314
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:32,546
Is it bad, Josey?

315
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,131
It's bad.

316
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:37,134
Don't look at it, boy.

317
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:40,262
It'll just make you get feelings in it.

318
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,519
If I don't make it...

319
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,395
...I want you to know...

320
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:51,232
...I'm prouder than a game rooster
to have rid with you.

321
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:53,818
You are a game rooster.
Now shut up.

322
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:58,572
- You could make it without me.
- Here.

323
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,534
Take a little drink of this.

324
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:19,093
This here linsey-woolsey shirt I got
that all you boys wore.

325
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:22,429
We didn't have no ma.

326
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:27,768
So Pa did all the
fancy needlework for me.

327
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:32,356
Told me not to tell no one.

328
00:36:35,277 --> 00:36:39,154
Imagine a grown man doing that
for his own kid?

329
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:44,159
Sang a little song while he sewed it.

330
00:36:45,287 --> 00:36:49,206
You know "Rose of Alabama," Josey?

331
00:36:50,584 --> 00:36:53,085
River rolled
The crickets sang

332
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:56,380
The lightning bug
He flashed his wing

333
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,383
And I could rope
My arms I fling

334
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,303
Round rose of Alabama

335
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,890
Oh, brown rosie

336
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:08,517
Rose of Alabama

337
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:13,898
A sweet tobacco posy
Is the rose of Alabama

338
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:17,985
Now you just do that, cousin.
You bring that old pistol right out.

339
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:20,905
We got him, Lige.

340
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,657
It's him, Abe. It's him.

341
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:25,492
We got the Josey Wales, Abe!

342
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:29,330
I seen him ride side by side
with Bloody Bill.

343
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:31,332
We got reward money coming.

344
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:36,003
Watch it. He's meaner than
a rattler and twice as fast!

345
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:39,632
You're a real bush hog,
ain't you, Mr. Josey Wales?

346
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:40,841
Tell you what.

347
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,844
Move on back. Move on back!

348
00:37:44,054 --> 00:37:46,180
Watch him.
I seen him do some things.

349
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:47,848
Shut up, Lige!

350
00:37:53,647 --> 00:37:55,022
Now...

351
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:57,733
...Mr. Josey Wales...

352
00:37:58,193 --> 00:37:59,777
...I'd just as soon shoot you now...

353
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:03,864
...except it'd be hard to drag your body
to where we can get our price for you.

354
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:07,034
- Shoot him now!
- Shut up, Lige.

355
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:12,206
Move your left hand down
and unbuckle that pistol belt.

356
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,459
Make it nice and slow...

357
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:18,212
...so I can count the hairs
on that hand.

358
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:41,902
See, Lige?

359
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,406
You pull his teeth...

360
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,701
...he's harmless as a heel hound.

361
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:54,623
Always wanted to face out one of these
pistol fighters they all fuss about.

362
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,209
Only way you handle them.

363
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:59,420
Abe, watch out.

364
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:02,589
- He's probably got another pistol-
- Shut up, Lige.

365
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:05,926
Call Benny back there on the horse.

366
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,595
Benny! Come out!

367
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:11,140
We got us the Josey Wales!

368
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:13,851
Oh, brown rosie

369
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:16,270
Rose of Alabamy

370
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:17,855
Who is that?

371
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,650
He's just a boy. He's got a fever.

372
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:23,944
Tell him to shut up.

373
00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:26,947
Sweet tobacco posies-

374
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:30,325
Pa?

375
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,785
Is that you, Pa?

376
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:35,456
It ain't your pa! Now shut up!

377
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:37,291
Pa.

378
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,501
I got the gold right here, Pa.

379
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:42,629
What gold is he talking about?

380
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,132
There's no gold. He's crazy.

381
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,676
The gold me and Josey robbed
from the bank.

382
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:54,016
Lige, take a look under that blanket.

383
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:57,644
I got it right here.

384
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,832
Thought you could use some help.

385
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:24,505
You get those holes leaking, I'm going
to whomp you with a knotted plow-line.

386
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:26,882
They ain't honest.

387
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:29,843
I feel as pert as a rutting buck.

388
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:32,346
Good.

389
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,391
Because I ain't hauling you
all over hell's creation...

390
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,019
...dribbling blood over
half of Missouri.

391
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:43,190
Wish we had time to bury them fellows.

392
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:46,110
To hell with them fellows.

393
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:51,532
Buzzards got to eat, same as worms.

394
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:16,223
A real frog strangler.

395
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:22,104
Ten, 20 more miles and we'll be
safe in the Nations.

396
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:33,574
Some cavalry between us
and the Nations.

397
00:41:33,867 --> 00:41:36,160
We'll have to wait till they bed down...

398
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:37,995
...then walk through quiet.

399
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,581
Here, have some beef jerky.

400
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:44,459
Don't swallow nothing but the juice.
I'll go have a look-see.

401
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,170
You feel all right?

402
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:49,631
I feel real good, Josey.
We got them whupped.

403
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:55,804
- Josey, I want to thank you.
- For what?

404
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,098
For saving my life.

405
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:01,185
Forget about that, Jamie.

406
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:03,270
You know something, Josey?

407
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,315
I ain't scared no more.

408
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:13,030
All right.

409
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:43,852
We can start working our way
through now, boy.

410
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:46,313
This rain is giving us the-

411
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,215
This boy was brought up in...

412
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:16,510
...a time of blood and dying,
and never questioned a bit of it.

413
00:43:17,387 --> 00:43:20,389
Never turned his back
on his folks or his kind.

414
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:25,686
I rode with him, I got no complaints.

415
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:30,857
The bluebellies will give you
a better burial than I can, boy.

416
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:41,910
Halt!

417
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:44,871
- What's going on?
- Come on, get him.

418
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:20,801
Howdy.
- Howdy.

419
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:23,637
Name's Josey Wales.

420
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:26,807
I've heard of that name.

421
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:30,977
Some said you'd be headed this way.

422
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:36,650
And they said a man could get rich
on reward money...

423
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:38,360
...if he could kill you.

424
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:42,322
Seems like you was looking
to gain some money here.

425
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:46,118
Actually, I was looking
to gain an edge.

426
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:50,997
I thought you might be someone who
would sneak up behind me with a gun.

427
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:53,834
Where'd you ever get an idea like that?

428
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:57,170
It ain't supposed to be easy
to sneak up behind an Indian.

429
00:45:58,548 --> 00:46:00,841
I'm an Indian, all right.

430
00:46:01,384 --> 00:46:05,345
But here in the Nation,
they call us the civilized tribe.

431
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:10,851
They call us civilized because
we're easy to sneak up on.

432
00:46:12,228 --> 00:46:16,356
White men have been sneaking up
on us for years.

433
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:19,025
Cherokee, huh?

434
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:21,403
Yeah.

435
00:46:21,863 --> 00:46:26,741
They sneaked up on us and they
told us we wouldn't be happy here.

436
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:30,412
They said we would be happier
in the Nations.

437
00:46:31,164 --> 00:46:34,082
So they took away our land...

438
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:36,209
...and sent us here.

439
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:40,672
I have a fine woman...

440
00:46:41,716 --> 00:46:43,550
...and two sons.

441
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:47,095
But they all died on the Trail of Tears.

442
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:54,269
And now the white man
is sneaking up on me.

443
00:46:56,105 --> 00:46:57,731
Again.

444
00:47:03,488 --> 00:47:05,947
Seems like we can't trust
the white man.

445
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,492
You bet we can't.

446
00:47:10,912 --> 00:47:12,704
I wore this...

447
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:16,249
...frock coat in Washington.

448
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:17,959
Before the war.

449
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,630
We wore them because we belonged to...

450
00:47:21,923 --> 00:47:24,090
...the five civilized tribes.

451
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:29,638
We dressed ourselves up
like Abraham Lincoln.

452
00:47:33,476 --> 00:47:38,271
We got to see the
Secretary of the Interior.

453
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,857
And he said:

454
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:44,653
"Boy! You boys sure look civilized!"

455
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:48,365
He congratulated us...

456
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:52,494
...and he gave us medals
for looking so civilized.

457
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:56,456
We told him about how
our land had been stolen...

458
00:47:56,958 --> 00:47:59,000
...and our people were dying.

459
00:48:00,545 --> 00:48:03,380
When we finished,
he shook our hands...

460
00:48:03,673 --> 00:48:04,965
...and said:

461
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,843
"Endeavor to persevere. "

462
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:11,304
They stood us in a line.

463
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:14,641
John Jumper, Chilly Mclntosh...

464
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:17,143
...Buffalo Hump...

465
00:48:18,688 --> 00:48:21,064
...and Jim Pock Mark and me.

466
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,566
I'm Lone Watie.

467
00:48:22,984 --> 00:48:24,985
They took our pictures.

468
00:48:25,528 --> 00:48:27,821
And the newspaper said:

469
00:48:28,364 --> 00:48:32,993
"Indians Vow to
Endeavor to Persevere. "

470
00:48:33,661 --> 00:48:36,162
We thought about it for a long time.

471
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:39,291
"Endeavor to persevere. "

472
00:48:39,834 --> 00:48:43,712
And when we had thought
about it long enough...

473
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:46,923
...we declared war on the Union.

474
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:04,941
Sergeant said this kid tried to ride
through their camp. They got him.

475
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:08,903
- They did, did they?
- Mm-hm.

476
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:12,032
They've had men on guard here
night and day.

477
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:14,451
No way Wales could get to the Nations.

478
00:49:20,041 --> 00:49:21,958
Where are you going, Fletcher?

479
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:24,711
I'm heading into the Indian Nations.

480
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,213
Why don't you stay here, Redlegs?

481
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:30,342
Wales may be back in a year or two.

482
00:49:33,638 --> 00:49:36,765
When we get to the Nations,
I want you men to fan out.

483
00:49:37,058 --> 00:49:39,643
Five thousand dollars
to the one who gets him.

484
00:49:59,288 --> 00:50:02,749
A horned toad can tell you
which way to go.

485
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,628
I used to know these things
when I was young.

486
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:10,757
But when I got civilized,
I forgot all these things.

487
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:12,926
I didn't know which way to go.

488
00:50:13,302 --> 00:50:16,471
The horned toad says
we should go to Mexico.

489
00:50:24,105 --> 00:50:26,481
Well, Mr. Lone Watie...

490
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:31,778
...you can take your horned toad
down Mexico way.

491
00:50:32,488 --> 00:50:35,115
I've got some unfinished
business in Missouri.

492
00:50:35,825 --> 00:50:38,284
I heard General Joe Shelby...

493
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:41,454
...and some men refused to surrender.

494
00:50:41,664 --> 00:50:43,331
They're going down to Mexico.

495
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:44,958
I think I'll join them.

496
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:47,043
Shelby, huh?

497
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:49,295
I didn't know others
hadn't surrendered.

498
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:51,506
I didn't surrender, neither.

499
00:50:51,799 --> 00:50:55,468
But they took my horse
and made him surrender.

500
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,972
They have him pulling a wagon
up in Kansas, I'll bet.

501
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:03,810
You haven't got a horse.

502
00:51:04,145 --> 00:51:06,521
What do you plan on doing,
walking to Mexico?

503
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:09,691
No, there's a trading post
right near the Creek Nation.

504
00:51:09,942 --> 00:51:11,860
They got horses to trade.

505
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,071
You have any food here?

506
00:51:16,699 --> 00:51:19,868
All I have is a piece of hard rock candy.

507
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:22,996
But it's not for eating.

508
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:25,498
It's just for looking through.

509
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:30,211
Alrighty.

510
00:51:34,383 --> 00:51:36,342
I'll get you a horse.

511
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,117
What have you got there?

512
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:02,452
Muskrat.

513
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,204
Muskrat?

514
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:05,538
What the hell's that?

515
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:07,040
Muskrat.

516
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:11,211
No. No, sir.
You got to come up with something more.

517
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:13,797
- Beaver?
- Beaver ain't no good no more.

518
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:15,924
Get me 10 muskrats...

519
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:18,718
...and 30 beaver pelts...

520
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:21,095
...and I'll give you red cloth.

521
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:24,891
Now that's a very good bargain for you.

522
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,562
Here.

523
00:52:29,814 --> 00:52:32,732
You go have a drink
and think about it.

524
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:41,407
Spilling!

525
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:53,461
You bring some drink inside, you hear?

526
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:05,765
I'll tell you, this jerky?

527
00:53:05,975 --> 00:53:07,600
Put it on our bill.

528
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,144
What about these cougar pelts?

529
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:12,564
Going to put them on our bill too?

530
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:19,112
This is what you give those Indians.

531
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:21,447
Where's the real stuff?

532
00:53:38,299 --> 00:53:40,133
What do you take for the squaw?

533
00:53:40,593 --> 00:53:42,302
She ain't for sale.

534
00:53:44,513 --> 00:53:46,639
I mean, she ain't mine.

535
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:48,892
She works here.

536
00:53:52,313 --> 00:53:53,646
See that nose scar?

537
00:53:56,108 --> 00:53:58,192
Know what that means to a Cheyenne?

538
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:00,153
One too many bucks.

539
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:03,323
Little squaw likes the bucks, huh?

540
00:54:03,616 --> 00:54:06,492
Tell you, Zukie, you put her
on the bill too.

541
00:54:38,192 --> 00:54:40,193
I'll be looking for a horse.

542
00:54:41,195 --> 00:54:42,362
A horse?

543
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:46,199
The horses belong to these gentlemen.

544
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,035
More than likely- That is...

545
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:51,537
...I'm sure they'd sell you one.

546
00:54:58,754 --> 00:55:00,880
Look, I've got some beer.

547
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:02,924
Some good brewed choc.

548
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:06,970
It's on the house.

549
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:24,904
You suppose these gentlemen will be...

550
00:55:25,114 --> 00:55:27,949
...available to discuss business
before long?

551
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:35,915
Give me a bucket of that choc.

552
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:46,926
I got him!

553
00:55:47,136 --> 00:55:49,095
I got me Josey Wales!

554
00:55:50,973 --> 00:55:52,432
Yoke.

555
00:55:52,933 --> 00:55:56,269
Five thousand gold simoleons
walked right in.

556
00:55:56,729 --> 00:55:58,730
- Right to us.
Wait a minute!

557
00:55:58,939 --> 00:56:00,231
He's in my place.

558
00:56:00,649 --> 00:56:01,816
I recognized him too.

559
00:56:03,444 --> 00:56:04,777
I'm due an even split.

560
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:11,784
Mr. Chain-Blue Lightning himself.

561
00:56:12,995 --> 00:56:17,123
Well, the one that everyone's
so scared of.

562
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:19,792
Well, Mr. Lightning...

563
00:56:20,461 --> 00:56:23,796
...move a muscle, twitch a finger...

564
00:56:24,048 --> 00:56:26,632
...and I'll splatter your guts
all over the wall.

565
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:29,552
Mr. Lightning.

566
00:56:30,554 --> 00:56:32,263
When I say move...

567
00:56:32,473 --> 00:56:34,307
...you move real slow...

568
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:36,476
...like molasses in wintertime...

569
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,478
...or I drop that hammer.

570
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:42,356
Now, just ease your hands down.

571
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:47,487
Take them guns out, butt first
so's you can get hold of them.

572
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:50,656
You understand?

573
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:53,993
Nod, damn you!

574
00:56:58,791 --> 00:56:59,832
Now...

575
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:03,044
...ease them pistols out.

576
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:37,078
Well, let's see...

577
00:57:38,122 --> 00:57:40,748
...you say those horses belong
to them pilgrims?

578
00:58:17,286 --> 00:58:19,620
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

579
00:58:19,872 --> 00:58:23,291
I'm getting better at sneaking up
on you like this.

580
00:58:23,792 --> 00:58:26,419
Only an Indian can do
something like this.

581
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:29,922
That's what I figured.

582
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:31,591
You figured?

583
00:58:32,885 --> 00:58:35,511
Only an Indian could do
something like that.

584
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:54,614
It's not right, this damn woman
doing something like this to me.

585
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:56,699
I used to have power.

586
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:59,202
Now old age is creeping up on me.

587
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:05,208
I think it's more like
old habits than old age.

588
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,294
Who the hell is this woman?

589
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:12,924
She was back at the trading post.
Got in some kind of trouble.

590
00:59:13,634 --> 00:59:17,136
- She's not going to Mexico with us.
- With us?

591
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:20,681
Now wait a minute. I got you a horse.
You're on your own now.

592
00:59:20,933 --> 00:59:22,475
I've seen a lot today.

593
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:26,354
I've seen patrols of soldiers all day.

594
00:59:27,022 --> 00:59:29,649
Everybody's looking for you.

595
00:59:31,735 --> 00:59:33,319
She's not going with us.

596
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:49,710
She says she's Navajo...

597
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:52,672
...but she was captured
by the Cheyenne.

598
00:59:52,965 --> 00:59:56,759
She was violated by one of the bucks
of the Arapahos.

599
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:59,679
Their sign is the dirty nose sign.

600
00:59:59,888 --> 01:00:02,265
Cheyenne Chief, Black Kettle...

601
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:06,519
...figures that she did not
resist enough.

602
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:17,780
Hell, man, can't you get
her to shut up?

603
01:00:42,431 --> 01:00:44,515
Anyway, she says...

604
01:00:44,725 --> 01:00:47,435
...when she come to that trading post...

605
01:00:47,728 --> 01:00:50,730
...she didn't know this man,
Zukie Limmer...

606
01:00:50,939 --> 01:00:52,398
...was selling liquor.

607
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:55,067
She also wants you to know...

608
01:00:55,277 --> 01:00:57,570
...that although he beat her a lot...

609
01:00:57,821 --> 01:01:00,406
...nothing happened between them.

610
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:04,577
And she says you are a great warrior...

611
01:01:04,828 --> 01:01:09,665
...and that she sort of belongs to you
for what you done for her.

612
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:14,128
Look, you tell her I don't want
nobody belonging to me.

613
01:01:16,965 --> 01:01:18,966
That meal was damn good.

614
01:01:19,259 --> 01:01:23,346
I'm going to take up tepee living
if it's like this.

615
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:28,142
You know, she thinks I'm some kind
of a Cherokee chief.

616
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,938
I wonder where she ever got that idea.

617
01:01:40,364 --> 01:01:43,616
Chief! Chief!

618
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,663
Chief.

619
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:51,832
I was just wondering.

620
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:55,461
I suppose that mangy hound's
got no place else to go either.

621
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,843
He might as well ride along with us.

622
01:02:03,345 --> 01:02:05,638
Hell, everybody else is.

623
01:02:53,061 --> 01:02:54,228
Hey, you!

624
01:02:55,397 --> 01:02:57,022
Want to buy some Indian scalps?

625
01:04:04,424 --> 01:04:05,925
Nasty habit, young fellow.

626
01:04:06,134 --> 01:04:08,010
You born in a barn?

627
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:11,096
Hold it. Real still.

628
01:04:21,942 --> 01:04:25,945
The wheat is from Kansas and the
molasses comes from Missouri.

629
01:04:26,154 --> 01:04:27,655
We'll do without molasses.

630
01:04:27,948 --> 01:04:30,324
Anything from Missouri
has a taint about it.

631
01:04:30,617 --> 01:04:33,786
Grandma, you've got to tread lightly
now we're here in Texas.

632
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:36,539
Lots of nice elements from
Missouri coming West.

633
01:04:36,790 --> 01:04:41,043
Nothing nice comes from Missouri.
And treading lightly is not my way.

634
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:43,963
We're from Kansas.
Jayhawkers, and proud of it.

635
01:04:44,172 --> 01:04:46,674
I know how you feel.
I'm a Hoosier, myself.

636
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:50,302
Personally, I don't think much
of Hoosiers neither.

637
01:05:00,981 --> 01:05:02,314
Yes, friends, yes!

638
01:05:02,524 --> 01:05:05,651
This is a positive remedy
for weariness...

639
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:09,321
...turgidity of the bowels and-

640
01:05:12,075 --> 01:05:14,577
Say, you're an Indian, aren't you?

641
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:19,206
You speak any English?

642
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:22,501
Well, sir, this is the very best thing...

643
01:05:22,711 --> 01:05:25,296
...for those who can't handle
their liquor.

644
01:05:28,675 --> 01:05:30,175
What's in it?

645
01:05:32,679 --> 01:05:36,056
I don't know. Various things.
I'm only the salesman.

646
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:39,059
You drink it.

647
01:05:39,227 --> 01:05:40,519
What's that?

648
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:43,856
You drink it.

649
01:05:50,739 --> 01:05:54,408
Well, what can you expect
from a nonbeliever?

650
01:05:55,327 --> 01:05:59,204
That old lady don't know the trouble
she can get into talking like that.

651
01:05:59,831 --> 01:06:02,458
Too many folks around here
with thin skin.

652
01:06:02,626 --> 01:06:05,461
Lots of Southern boys
been getting into trouble here.

653
01:06:05,712 --> 01:06:10,049
Cullen Baker and Captain Bob Lee
been fighting over in Fannin County.

654
01:06:10,342 --> 01:06:12,134
Bill Longley, Creed Taylor...

655
01:06:12,427 --> 01:06:15,387
...and all them other Taylors
down in Gonzalez.

656
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:18,057
Killed Simp Dixon over in Cotton Gin...

657
01:06:18,350 --> 01:06:20,225
...weighted him down with lead.

658
01:06:21,269 --> 01:06:23,771
I got a picture postcard of it.

659
01:06:24,648 --> 01:06:26,982
Here. Have a look.

660
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:30,235
Josey Wales.

661
01:06:34,783 --> 01:06:35,866
What say?

662
01:06:36,076 --> 01:06:38,619
Josey Wales.
They say he's coming into Texas.

663
01:06:38,912 --> 01:06:41,997
Won't come through here though.
Killed 50, 60 men.

664
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:45,417
Regulators are all over the place
looking for him.

665
01:06:47,462 --> 01:06:48,629
How much for all this?

666
01:06:48,922 --> 01:06:50,089
Three dollars.

667
01:06:50,965 --> 01:06:52,925
Those regulators would pay plenty...

668
01:06:53,176 --> 01:06:56,261
...to the man who could
identify Josey Wales.

669
01:06:57,764 --> 01:06:59,473
Reckon so.

670
01:07:09,943 --> 01:07:11,026
How about you, sir?

671
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:14,446
Just a few bottles left.
You won't regret it.

672
01:07:22,205 --> 01:07:23,789
Oh, my God!

673
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,457
It's Josey Wales!

674
01:07:55,989 --> 01:07:58,657
You going to pull those pistols
or whistle "Dixie"?

675
01:08:46,706 --> 01:08:48,540
I told you to stay inside.

676
01:08:56,925 --> 01:08:58,091
Goddamn Indian squaw!

677
01:09:01,304 --> 01:09:02,387
Let's go!

678
01:09:39,634 --> 01:09:42,261
Welcome to Texas, Mr. Lone Watie.

679
01:09:43,847 --> 01:09:48,100
I guess we ain't going to see that
little Navajo girl again.

680
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:50,060
I guess not.

681
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:52,271
I kind of liked her.

682
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:54,940
- But it's always like that.
- Like what?

683
01:09:56,109 --> 01:09:58,819
Whenever I get to liking someone,
they ain't around long.

684
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:03,991
I notice when you get to disliking someone
they ain't around long neither.

685
01:10:07,287 --> 01:10:10,122
How did you know which one
was going to shoot first?

686
01:10:11,374 --> 01:10:13,792
That one in the center
had a flap holster...

687
01:10:14,002 --> 01:10:16,128
...and he was in no itching hurry.

688
01:10:16,796 --> 01:10:18,630
And the one second from the left...

689
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:21,300
...had scared eyes.
He wasn't going to do nothing.

690
01:10:21,593 --> 01:10:23,385
But that one on the far left...

691
01:10:23,636 --> 01:10:27,180
...had crazy eyes.
Figured him to make the first move.

692
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:28,891
And the one on the right?

693
01:10:34,105 --> 01:10:35,981
Never paid no him no mind.

694
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:37,357
You were there.

695
01:10:43,156 --> 01:10:44,323
I could have missed.

696
01:10:44,532 --> 01:10:47,367
Yes, sir!
It was Josey Wales, all right!

697
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:50,704
Saw him heading north out of town
with a renegade Injun.

698
01:10:51,831 --> 01:10:53,332
I can identify him.

699
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:57,669
And I'd certainly be glad
to share in any reward.

700
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:01,048
Knew him quite well, actually.

701
01:11:03,843 --> 01:11:06,261
Well, not a hard man to track.

702
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:09,222
Leaves dead men wherever he goes.

703
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:12,184
He's heading north now...

704
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:14,728
...riding with a renegade Indian.

705
01:11:15,855 --> 01:11:18,523
He's heading north now,
but he'll turn southwest...

706
01:11:18,733 --> 01:11:20,192
...head for Mexico.

707
01:11:20,401 --> 01:11:23,278
Then we'll turn southwest
and head for Mexico.

708
01:11:23,738 --> 01:11:25,697
Tell them to head north.

709
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,158
What are you talking about?

710
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:34,915
Look at those boys over there
with tied-down guns.

711
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:38,377
Bounty hunters.

712
01:11:38,878 --> 01:11:42,547
Come out of a war,
got no other way to make a living.

713
01:11:43,383 --> 01:11:47,386
Every last mother's son of them wants
that money you've got on Wales' head.

714
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:51,056
You and me didn't ride
all that way for that.

715
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:55,060
I don't want to hear Wales is dead.

716
01:11:56,604 --> 01:11:58,730
I want to see Wales dead.

717
01:12:03,069 --> 01:12:05,779
We're heading north, men. Let's ride.

718
01:12:27,427 --> 01:12:28,593
They're following us.

719
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:35,100
Couple of horses, far off, moving fast.

720
01:12:36,811 --> 01:12:37,978
I don't hear nothing.

721
01:12:39,939 --> 01:12:42,232
Got to be an Indian to know
those things.

722
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:49,781
Yeah. All right, let's take them
out in the sand.

723
01:14:02,396 --> 01:14:05,899
Glad you stopped me when you did.
I might have killed her.

724
01:14:06,234 --> 01:14:08,026
Oh, I noticed that.

725
01:14:14,117 --> 01:14:16,618
She got some supplies...

726
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:18,537
...and our horses...

727
01:14:18,746 --> 01:14:20,872
...and followed us around.

728
01:14:21,249 --> 01:14:24,376
She said we was the only kin she had.

729
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:26,920
I bet we are, at that.

730
01:14:28,214 --> 01:14:30,924
You know, every man I ever knew...

731
01:14:31,217 --> 01:14:33,552
...who was good with a gun and lived...

732
01:14:33,761 --> 01:14:35,887
...always had an edge.

733
01:14:36,722 --> 01:14:40,225
Some of them would like to have
the sun behind their back.

734
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:43,562
That's always a good idea.

735
01:14:45,273 --> 01:14:49,067
Yeah. Sure pays to have an edge.

736
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:53,780
Yeah.

737
01:14:55,116 --> 01:14:57,409
All kind of edges.

738
01:14:59,245 --> 01:15:02,914
- Yeah.
- Yep.

739
01:15:36,908 --> 01:15:38,825
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

740
01:15:39,785 --> 01:15:42,204
- Is something wrong?
- Nope.

741
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:44,623
I guess you were right.

742
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:47,459
I ain't that old, after all.

743
01:16:20,534 --> 01:16:22,661
Not many men west of here.

744
01:16:23,162 --> 01:16:26,039
We're getting into Comanche country.

745
01:16:31,462 --> 01:16:32,837
Wagon tracks.

746
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:35,840
But I never seen tracks like these.

747
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:39,678
Never heard of Comanches traveling
in two-wheeled carts.

748
01:16:40,012 --> 01:16:41,179
Comancheros.

749
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:52,857
Comancheros...

750
01:16:53,067 --> 01:16:57,195
...trade liquor and guns
to Comanche for horses.

751
01:16:57,989 --> 01:16:59,698
Trade women too.

752
01:17:00,366 --> 01:17:02,033
How many of them?

753
01:17:03,369 --> 01:17:07,872
Eight, maybe nine horses,
and a couple of carts.

754
01:17:53,461 --> 01:17:56,087
Those poor pilgrims from Kansas.

755
01:17:58,466 --> 01:18:00,467
They don't look too proud now, do they?

756
01:19:49,034 --> 01:19:50,285
Wait.

757
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:07,218
Please.

758
01:20:21,942 --> 01:20:23,234
You son of a bitch!

759
01:20:24,403 --> 01:20:26,738
Ten Bears is going to want
a fresh woman!

760
01:20:29,074 --> 01:20:31,910
Fresh, that little gal will
bring maybe 20 horses.

761
01:20:34,455 --> 01:20:38,917
Now if one of you has to,
take that old woman over there.

762
01:20:40,419 --> 01:20:43,254
She might be worth maybe one donkey.

763
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:08,738
Fix yourself.

764
01:22:24,315 --> 01:22:26,316
Move faster!

765
01:22:30,904 --> 01:22:32,363
If you fall...

766
01:22:32,615 --> 01:22:35,617
...they'll let you die. Keep walking.

767
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:45,084
Come around here, bitch.
Come around here.

768
01:22:48,964 --> 01:22:51,382
Come here. Now you listen to me.

769
01:22:51,634 --> 01:22:54,385
I want you looking real good
when we get to Ten Bears.

770
01:22:54,637 --> 01:22:59,098
So I want you to jump in that wagon
and put on one of your best little dresses.

771
01:23:01,393 --> 01:23:03,227
It might boost your price.

772
01:23:04,104 --> 01:23:08,107
If you look good enough, I might outbid
old Ten Bears and take you for myself.

773
01:23:45,521 --> 01:23:47,397
If I figure this right...

774
01:23:47,773 --> 01:23:49,899
...we're facing the sun.

775
01:23:50,484 --> 01:23:52,819
This ought to give him an edge.

776
01:23:53,654 --> 01:23:55,446
Who are you talking about?

777
01:23:55,656 --> 01:23:57,156
What the hell does he want?

778
01:23:57,449 --> 01:23:58,825
Looks like a parley.

779
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:09,627
Are you just going to sit there or
you going to see what he wants?

780
01:24:12,423 --> 01:24:14,424
Get ready, little lady.

781
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:17,009
Hell is coming to breakfast.

782
01:24:25,811 --> 01:24:28,312
That's a mighty nice horse
you got there, mister.

783
01:24:28,522 --> 01:24:29,981
Would you sell it?

784
01:24:30,482 --> 01:24:33,025
We will give you a good price.

785
01:24:41,034 --> 01:24:42,160
Now spit!

786
01:24:47,332 --> 01:24:49,542
Just get off the horse.

787
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:56,382
Get out of the way!

788
01:25:53,816 --> 01:25:56,734
Now you'll kill us, I suppose.

789
01:25:57,736 --> 01:26:01,239
I'd have been halfway to Mexico by now
except for that crazy squaw.

790
01:26:01,448 --> 01:26:03,574
I can't understand a word she says.

791
01:26:04,576 --> 01:26:06,661
I knew that would bring you.

792
01:26:21,969 --> 01:26:23,594
Help us!

793
01:26:26,932 --> 01:26:28,182
Help us.

794
01:26:28,559 --> 01:26:30,268
Comanches.

795
01:26:30,561 --> 01:26:34,063
They won't like us killing these friends
of theirs. We better get moving.

796
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:26,157
Looks like a family of hogs just moved
out of the seat of these britches.

797
01:27:27,701 --> 01:27:30,661
I had such beautiful clothes...

798
01:27:30,871 --> 01:27:33,372
...I was taking to our ranch.

799
01:27:34,499 --> 01:27:36,500
Whereabouts is this ranch?

800
01:27:37,044 --> 01:27:41,505
My son's ranch, he found before the war
near a town called Santo Rio.

801
01:27:41,757 --> 01:27:43,341
Creek with good water...

802
01:27:43,550 --> 01:27:45,843
...trees, cattle, black-tailed deer.

803
01:27:46,637 --> 01:27:49,513
It's a regular
paradise we're headed to.

804
01:27:49,932 --> 01:27:51,265
Out there?

805
01:27:52,184 --> 01:27:54,852
Your son told you this was out there?

806
01:27:55,187 --> 01:27:58,272
He told me that.
Near a place called Blood Butte.

807
01:27:58,774 --> 01:28:01,150
My son was true-blue, Mr. Wales.

808
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:04,028
He never lied. It'll be there, all right.

809
01:28:06,406 --> 01:28:09,033
Yes, ma'am, I'm sure it will be.

810
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:12,453
Cottonwoods, live oaks...

811
01:28:12,788 --> 01:28:14,914
...wild horses...

812
01:28:15,207 --> 01:28:16,874
...antelope...

813
01:28:17,167 --> 01:28:18,793
...lots of quail.

814
01:28:26,468 --> 01:28:27,551
You see them?

815
01:28:28,804 --> 01:28:29,887
What?

816
01:28:30,555 --> 01:28:32,264
The clouds over there.

817
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:36,894
Clouds are like...

818
01:28:37,104 --> 01:28:40,606
...dreams floating across
a sky-blue mind.

819
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:45,945
I never thought of them that way.

820
01:28:49,616 --> 01:28:50,992
Indian...

821
01:28:51,451 --> 01:28:55,079
...this Mr. Wales is a cold-blooded killer.

822
01:28:55,288 --> 01:28:56,580
He's from Missouri...

823
01:28:56,790 --> 01:29:01,252
...where they're all known to be killers
of innocent men, women and children.

824
01:29:01,461 --> 01:29:04,255
Would you rather be riding with
Comancheros, Grannie?

825
01:29:06,717 --> 01:29:08,342
No, I wouldn't.

826
01:30:06,818 --> 01:30:11,989
I lost my sweet lover

827
01:30:12,199 --> 01:30:16,827
In the dirty old mines

828
01:30:17,037 --> 01:30:21,999
But he's coming back

829
01:30:22,292 --> 01:30:27,046
No matter how long I wait

830
01:30:27,297 --> 01:30:32,676
My lover is coming-

831
01:30:36,848 --> 01:30:38,182
What'll you have?

832
01:30:41,436 --> 01:30:42,728
Whiskey.

833
01:30:43,313 --> 01:30:44,814
Whiskey, he says!

834
01:30:46,691 --> 01:30:48,359
How about something else?

835
01:30:50,028 --> 01:30:52,404
Well, beer, then.

836
01:30:53,031 --> 01:30:56,700
And get those gents whatever
they're drinking. You too, ma'am.

837
01:30:58,745 --> 01:31:00,371
That's mighty decent of you.

838
01:31:00,622 --> 01:31:03,833
Been a long time since anybody
bought a drink around here.

839
01:31:04,042 --> 01:31:07,044
About as long as we had
anything to drink around here.

840
01:31:07,254 --> 01:31:09,213
Or anything else.

841
01:31:10,549 --> 01:31:14,385
Yeah, first the silver
run out of the Santo Rio.

842
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:16,762
Then the people run out.

843
01:31:17,055 --> 01:31:18,848
Then the whiskey.

844
01:31:19,057 --> 01:31:21,267
Then the beer run out.

845
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:22,726
Well, no matter.

846
01:31:23,770 --> 01:31:26,438
It's good to see a high roller
wander through.

847
01:31:40,745 --> 01:31:42,663
I didn't mean to offend him.

848
01:31:42,914 --> 01:31:46,250
I guess some fellows just don't like
to be called high rollers.

849
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:50,921
You know, I knew a fellow once,
he didn't like to be called highhanded.

850
01:31:53,925 --> 01:31:55,593
We'll have whiskey all around.

851
01:31:55,886 --> 01:31:57,636
Comanchero brand.

852
01:32:04,519 --> 01:32:07,271
Angels of Mercy come to Santo Rio!

853
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:09,398
This ain't Santo Rio.

854
01:32:09,608 --> 01:32:12,318
My son, Tom Turner,
said it was a thriving place.

855
01:32:12,611 --> 01:32:14,153
It was.

856
01:32:14,446 --> 01:32:17,489
But when the silver run out,
the thriving run out.

857
01:32:17,782 --> 01:32:18,908
That's right.

858
01:32:19,117 --> 01:32:21,619
I do declare.

859
01:32:21,912 --> 01:32:23,787
Might you be the mother
of Tom Turner...

860
01:32:24,039 --> 01:32:27,124
...whose Crooked River Ranch
is over by Blood Butte?

861
01:32:27,334 --> 01:32:30,794
- That I might, miss.
- Well!

862
01:32:31,004 --> 01:32:33,422
I am Rose.

863
01:32:33,632 --> 01:32:35,299
Rose of Santo Rio.

864
01:32:35,508 --> 01:32:38,010
I reckon he wrote you all about me.

865
01:32:38,470 --> 01:32:40,846
I don't recollect that.

866
01:32:41,139 --> 01:32:43,641
After his Lucy passed on...

867
01:32:43,850 --> 01:32:45,809
...he didn't show much
interest in women.

868
01:32:46,853 --> 01:32:51,732
My sonny-boy kept his nose to the
grindstone, providing a future for me...

869
01:32:51,983 --> 01:32:53,150
...and his daughter there.

870
01:32:56,863 --> 01:33:00,824
I do seem to recall him
telling me something about...

871
01:33:01,034 --> 01:33:03,994
...a daughter who was a little odd.

872
01:33:04,204 --> 01:33:08,749
He was killed in the Border War
by Missouri ruffians.

873
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:12,336
He died a proud member of
Senator Jim Lane's Redlegs...

874
01:33:14,381 --> 01:33:15,839
...fighting for the just cause!

875
01:33:16,091 --> 01:33:18,259
I am sorry to hear that.

876
01:33:18,510 --> 01:33:21,512
I mean, he was of the finest sort.

877
01:33:21,763 --> 01:33:24,265
Señora, please sit down.

878
01:33:24,516 --> 01:33:27,184
You must be very, very tired.

879
01:33:28,979 --> 01:33:32,690
I am deeply sorrowed to hear this.

880
01:33:32,983 --> 01:33:34,525
In past years...

881
01:33:34,734 --> 01:33:38,195
...my friend and I were of service
to your Tom Turner.

882
01:33:38,405 --> 01:33:40,698
And now we are at your service.

883
01:33:42,117 --> 01:33:45,744
Why, I appreciate your concern.

884
01:33:46,037 --> 01:33:49,373
I am glad to find manners at last,
here in the wilderness.

885
01:33:49,874 --> 01:33:53,919
We have endured hardship of the
worst sort on the way out here.

886
01:33:55,088 --> 01:33:58,590
Grandpa Samuel and Uncle Enoch...

887
01:33:58,883 --> 01:34:01,552
...fell prey to Comancheros.

888
01:34:01,761 --> 01:34:05,597
Let's drink to the silver running out.
Gave us some peace and quiet here!

889
01:34:05,890 --> 01:34:07,599
Bad luck, the silver running out.

890
01:34:09,144 --> 01:34:11,061
I wouldn't have any other kind!

891
01:34:19,279 --> 01:34:20,321
What'll you have?

892
01:34:21,948 --> 01:34:24,033
I'm looking for Josey Wales.

893
01:34:27,287 --> 01:34:28,454
That'll be me.

894
01:34:32,334 --> 01:34:34,043
You're wanted, Wales.

895
01:34:34,419 --> 01:34:36,420
Reckon I'm right popular.

896
01:34:38,757 --> 01:34:40,174
You a bounty hunter?

897
01:34:40,592 --> 01:34:43,427
A man's got to do something
for a living these days.

898
01:34:44,471 --> 01:34:46,972
Dying ain't much of a living, boy.

899
01:34:50,935 --> 01:34:53,062
You know, this isn't necessary.

900
01:34:53,938 --> 01:34:55,939
You can just ride on.

901
01:35:13,625 --> 01:35:15,376
Whew.

902
01:35:33,895 --> 01:35:35,187
I had to come back.

903
01:35:36,356 --> 01:35:37,606
I know.

904
01:36:19,649 --> 01:36:22,151
- Comanche?
- Comanches, all right.

905
01:36:22,902 --> 01:36:24,194
Any more of them?

906
01:36:24,404 --> 01:36:26,530
I think that's all there is...

907
01:36:26,865 --> 01:36:29,575
...but they have horses
packing antelope...

908
01:36:29,868 --> 01:36:32,244
...so I figure they're not
a raiding party.

909
01:36:32,745 --> 01:36:35,038
But you never can tell
these Comanches.

910
01:36:36,207 --> 01:36:37,708
You stay with the cart.

911
01:36:57,103 --> 01:36:59,229
Just looking us over, I guess.

912
01:36:59,731 --> 01:37:01,607
They're packing heavy.

913
01:37:01,900 --> 01:37:02,983
They may return.

914
01:37:03,234 --> 01:37:04,902
All right, let's move out.

915
01:37:12,452 --> 01:37:15,078
If they ride with Ten Bears...

916
01:37:15,288 --> 01:37:16,914
...they will come back.

917
01:37:17,832 --> 01:37:20,959
Ten Bears is the greatest
Comanche war chief.

918
01:37:21,336 --> 01:37:22,586
But he's angry.

919
01:37:22,795 --> 01:37:26,215
Each year, he has met with
one of your bluecoat generals.

920
01:37:26,382 --> 01:37:27,633
Ain't one of my generals.

921
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:31,303
And each year he is pushed
further across the plains.

922
01:37:31,596 --> 01:37:34,515
General Sherman has come
with more promises.

923
01:37:34,766 --> 01:37:37,267
But Ten Bears will move no more.

924
01:38:31,364 --> 01:38:33,865
It's so beautiful.

925
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,502
All right, we can get to work
dusting first.

926
01:38:46,045 --> 01:38:50,799
Got a nice Dutch oven
in the fireplace here.

927
01:38:51,009 --> 01:38:55,012
Mr. Wales, you men chop some wood.

928
01:38:55,305 --> 01:38:58,515
Now, get everything done.

929
01:38:58,891 --> 01:39:01,184
Mr. Wales!

930
01:39:01,603 --> 01:39:04,313
Did you come all this way to gawk?

931
01:39:04,939 --> 01:39:07,357
If you don't work,
you don't eat around here.

932
01:39:07,609 --> 01:39:09,818
Didn't figure you for a loafer.

933
01:39:34,969 --> 01:39:37,638
You know, she told me...

934
01:39:37,889 --> 01:39:42,225
...it's the first time she ever had
a place of her own.

935
01:39:43,478 --> 01:39:45,937
Grandma says it's our home.

936
01:39:46,397 --> 01:39:48,607
It is all of ours.

937
01:39:49,442 --> 01:39:52,736
I'm glad there will be a man
around to take care of things.

938
01:39:53,488 --> 01:39:56,281
I'll be dropping back from time to time...

939
01:39:57,075 --> 01:39:59,242
...probably just to hole up.

940
01:39:59,911 --> 01:40:02,287
Why don't you stay with us?

941
01:40:02,747 --> 01:40:04,623
Be our partner.

942
01:40:06,084 --> 01:40:07,417
They won't miss you.

943
01:40:07,627 --> 01:40:09,878
Maybe they'll forget you.

944
01:40:11,964 --> 01:40:14,424
You know there ain't no forgetting.

945
01:41:04,976 --> 01:41:06,143
Pa!

946
01:41:36,966 --> 01:41:38,675
Hey there, Josey!

947
01:41:43,848 --> 01:41:46,016
We're going to Santo Rio!

948
01:41:55,485 --> 01:42:00,489
In the sweet by and by

949
01:42:00,698 --> 01:42:05,869
We shall meet in the beautiful shore

950
01:42:06,037 --> 01:42:11,208
In the sweet by and by

951
01:42:11,375 --> 01:42:16,797
We will meet on that beautiful shore

952
01:42:17,548 --> 01:42:19,549
In the sweet by and by

953
01:42:24,555 --> 01:42:30,018
We will meet on that beautiful shore.

954
01:42:30,937 --> 01:42:35,732
Lord, thanks a lot for bringing us
to this place.

955
01:42:36,734 --> 01:42:38,235
Pa and Daniel died...

956
01:42:38,528 --> 01:42:42,113
...at the hands of that low-down,
murdering trash out of hell...

957
01:42:42,573 --> 01:42:44,157
...that done them in.

958
01:42:44,742 --> 01:42:48,161
But they put up a good fight
and died the best they could.

959
01:42:48,788 --> 01:42:50,747
And thanks a lot for Josey Wales...

960
01:42:51,541 --> 01:42:54,835
...who you changed from
a murdering bushwhacker...

961
01:42:55,086 --> 01:42:56,837
...on the side of Satan...

962
01:42:57,088 --> 01:42:58,630
...to a better man...

963
01:42:58,923 --> 01:43:01,800
...in time to deliver us
from the Philistines.

964
01:43:02,426 --> 01:43:06,429
And thank you, Lord,
for getting us together in Texas.

965
01:43:14,146 --> 01:43:15,647
Are you all right?

966
01:43:15,857 --> 01:43:19,359
Ten Bears, he got Travis and Chato.

967
01:43:19,610 --> 01:43:22,112
He'll be riding here in the morning.

968
01:43:40,673 --> 01:43:43,717
If I was looking for a place
to hole up, I'd pick this one.

969
01:43:43,968 --> 01:43:46,469
Walls and ceiling, two feet thick.

970
01:43:46,721 --> 01:43:48,847
All made out of mud, nothing to burn.

971
01:43:50,099 --> 01:43:53,393
Two doors, front and back,
right in sight of one another.

972
01:43:53,644 --> 01:43:57,689
These here crosses are to fire rifles
through. Up and down, side to side.

973
01:43:57,982 --> 01:43:59,983
Tom Turner knew what he was doing.

974
01:44:00,151 --> 01:44:02,485
You bet he did.
I'll be shooting out of that door.

975
01:44:02,653 --> 01:44:04,905
I'd rather have you sit right there...

976
01:44:05,156 --> 01:44:07,407
...and do the loading.
Can you do that?

977
01:44:07,658 --> 01:44:09,034
I can.

978
01:44:10,328 --> 01:44:11,536
Moonlight...

979
01:44:12,163 --> 01:44:16,207
...I want you to go to this door.
You fire through here, all right?

980
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:19,169
Laura Lee, right through this window.
Can you shoot?

981
01:44:19,378 --> 01:44:20,503
I'll try.

982
01:44:20,755 --> 01:44:24,007
Lone, you take this window
right over here, and the door.

983
01:44:24,258 --> 01:44:25,759
Where there's the most firing.

984
01:44:26,010 --> 01:44:30,180
You'll have to keep an eye on
that hallway there because...

985
01:44:31,891 --> 01:44:36,019
...the only blind spot is the ceiling.
They'll get around to it eventually.

986
01:44:36,270 --> 01:44:38,855
They can't shoot through it,
but they might...

987
01:44:39,065 --> 01:44:42,233
...dig a hole in it and drop down,
maybe in the back bedroom.

988
01:44:43,903 --> 01:44:45,278
Now remember...

989
01:44:45,947 --> 01:44:49,074
...when things look bad,
and it looks like you won't make it...

990
01:44:49,450 --> 01:44:50,867
...then you got to get mean.

991
01:44:51,077 --> 01:44:53,370
I mean plumb, maddog mean!

992
01:44:53,871 --> 01:44:57,666
Because if you lose your head and give up,
then you neither live nor win.

993
01:44:58,209 --> 01:44:59,709
That's just the way it is.

994
01:45:00,086 --> 01:45:03,880
Use pistols at short range.
More fire power and less reloading.

995
01:45:04,090 --> 01:45:06,883
Keep this fire going.
Keep an iron on it red-hot.

996
01:45:07,176 --> 01:45:09,177
Anybody gets hit, slap iron to it.

997
01:45:09,387 --> 01:45:11,763
That's the fastest way
to stop the blood.

998
01:45:15,309 --> 01:45:17,310
What's all that paint about?

999
01:45:17,561 --> 01:45:19,187
It's my death face.

1000
01:45:20,064 --> 01:45:24,109
You know, we're sure going to show them
redskins something tomorrow!

1001
01:45:24,402 --> 01:45:25,819
No offense meant.

1002
01:45:27,071 --> 01:45:28,697
None taken.

1003
01:45:39,083 --> 01:45:40,208
Where's he going?

1004
01:45:40,584 --> 01:45:44,295
He knows he can do the best for us
on the back of a horse.

1005
01:45:44,588 --> 01:45:46,089
He's a guerrilla fighter.

1006
01:45:46,590 --> 01:45:49,592
He figures he can carry the fight
to the enemy.

1007
01:45:49,802 --> 01:45:53,596
He's going down into the valley
to kill Ten Bears...

1008
01:45:53,931 --> 01:45:56,349
...and as many of the men as he can.

1009
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:58,768
How will he do that and come back here?

1010
01:46:00,271 --> 01:46:01,604
He won't come back.

1011
01:46:07,486 --> 01:46:09,112
Josey!

1012
01:48:35,676 --> 01:48:36,759
You'll be Ten Bears?

1013
01:48:37,511 --> 01:48:39,262
I am Ten Bears.

1014
01:48:43,934 --> 01:48:45,768
I'm Josey Wales.

1015
01:48:47,938 --> 01:48:49,606
I have heard.

1016
01:48:50,691 --> 01:48:52,442
You're the Gray Rider.

1017
01:48:52,693 --> 01:48:57,280
You would not make peace with
the Bluecoats. You may go in peace.

1018
01:48:58,991 --> 01:49:00,033
I reckon not.

1019
01:49:06,040 --> 01:49:09,292
- Got nowhere to go.
- Then you will die.

1020
01:49:11,545 --> 01:49:13,463
I came here to die with you.

1021
01:49:15,799 --> 01:49:17,300
Or live with you.

1022
01:49:18,677 --> 01:49:21,804
Dying's not hard for you and me.
It's living that's hard...

1023
01:49:22,014 --> 01:49:25,016
...when all you ever cared about
has been butchered or raped.

1024
01:49:27,978 --> 01:49:30,939
Governments don't live together.
People live together.

1025
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:36,152
Governments don't give you a fair word
or a fair fight. I've come here to...

1026
01:49:36,445 --> 01:49:39,155
...give you either one.
Or get either one from you.

1027
01:49:42,576 --> 01:49:46,162
I came here like this so you'll know
my word of death is true.

1028
01:49:46,538 --> 01:49:48,957
And that my word of life is then true.

1029
01:49:52,002 --> 01:49:56,756
The bear lives here, the wolf,
the antelope, the Comanche.

1030
01:49:57,216 --> 01:49:59,008
And so will we.

1031
01:50:00,052 --> 01:50:03,513
We'll only hunt what we need to live on,
same as the Comanche does.

1032
01:50:04,515 --> 01:50:07,600
And every spring when
the Comanche moves north...

1033
01:50:07,851 --> 01:50:09,394
...he can rest here in peace...

1034
01:50:09,687 --> 01:50:13,189
...butcher some of our cattle
and jerk beef for the journey.

1035
01:50:13,857 --> 01:50:17,610
The sign of the Comanche,
that will be on our lodge.

1036
01:50:17,861 --> 01:50:19,028
That's my word of life.

1037
01:50:19,697 --> 01:50:21,364
And your word of death?

1038
01:50:22,199 --> 01:50:25,410
It's here in my pistols
and there in your rifles.

1039
01:50:25,703 --> 01:50:27,036
I'm here for either one.

1040
01:50:27,246 --> 01:50:31,708
These things you say we will have,
we already have.

1041
01:50:32,209 --> 01:50:36,004
That's true.
I ain't promising you nothing extra.

1042
01:50:36,547 --> 01:50:39,716
I'm just giving you life,
and you're giving me life.

1043
01:50:39,925 --> 01:50:43,720
And I'm saying men can live together
without butchering one another.

1044
01:50:46,223 --> 01:50:50,727
It's sad that governments are chiefed
by the double-tongues.

1045
01:50:50,936 --> 01:50:55,064
There is iron in your words of death
for all Comanches to see.

1046
01:50:55,274 --> 01:50:58,276
And so there is iron
in your words of life.

1047
01:50:58,902 --> 01:51:02,447
No signed paper can hold the iron.

1048
01:51:02,740 --> 01:51:04,741
It must come from men.

1049
01:51:05,534 --> 01:51:09,746
The words of Ten Bears carry
the same iron of life and death.

1050
01:51:10,247 --> 01:51:14,751
It is good that warriors such as we
meet in the struggle of life...

1051
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:16,586
...or death.

1052
01:51:19,256 --> 01:51:21,174
It shall be life.

1053
01:51:46,784 --> 01:51:47,950
So will it be.

1054
01:51:49,119 --> 01:51:50,787
I reckon so.

1055
01:51:53,290 --> 01:51:55,625
I'll be damned! Look at this!

1056
01:52:06,637 --> 01:52:08,888
Come. Sit down.

1057
01:52:09,139 --> 01:52:11,808
Oh, I'm so glad to see you!

1058
01:52:12,643 --> 01:52:15,228
I never thought I'd see you again,
Grandma.

1059
01:52:15,396 --> 01:52:18,523
Chato, Chato. Sit down.

1060
01:52:18,816 --> 01:52:20,817
I never been so glad to see an Indian.

1061
01:53:25,716 --> 01:53:28,384
I've got something to show you,
Mr. Wales.

1062
01:53:30,387 --> 01:53:32,597
I made this chain for you.

1063
01:53:32,890 --> 01:53:34,891
I braided it from my hair.

1064
01:53:37,728 --> 01:53:40,188
That's real nice. It really is.

1065
01:53:40,397 --> 01:53:42,231
It's a watch chain.

1066
01:53:43,108 --> 01:53:47,737
Yeah. Well, it's a nice one.
It will come in handy. I thank you for it.

1067
01:53:50,407 --> 01:53:52,742
You do have a watch, don't you?

1068
01:53:56,413 --> 01:53:58,831
Well, I've been meaning to get one, yeah.

1069
01:54:00,792 --> 01:54:02,585
Could we...

1070
01:54:02,794 --> 01:54:04,587
...play a song for you?

1071
01:54:05,964 --> 01:54:10,426
I'm afraid I don't really know
too many songs.

1072
01:54:20,103 --> 01:54:23,231
Could we play something you like?
Come on.

1073
01:54:23,774 --> 01:54:27,109
Only song I can think of is
"Rose of Alabama. "

1074
01:54:27,778 --> 01:54:30,613
We remember that old piece.
Rosie, come here.

1075
01:54:33,325 --> 01:54:38,788
Away from Mississippi's veil
With my old half-ear for a sail

1076
01:54:39,164 --> 01:54:41,832
I crossed upon a cotton bale

1077
01:54:42,125 --> 01:54:44,877
To the rose of Alabama

1078
01:54:46,672 --> 01:54:49,257
- Do you dance?
- No.

1079
01:54:49,466 --> 01:54:50,883
Me neither.

1080
01:54:51,677 --> 01:54:57,014
A sweet tobacco posy
Is the rose of Alabama

1081
01:54:57,307 --> 01:55:02,687
A sweet tobacco posy
Is the rose of Alabama

1082
01:55:02,896 --> 01:55:03,980
Help us out now.

1083
01:55:04,189 --> 01:55:09,151
Oh, brown rosie
The rose of Alabama

1084
01:55:12,489 --> 01:55:14,991
The rose of Alabama

1085
01:56:00,245 --> 01:56:03,414
I could see him through this window
when he shot my partner.

1086
01:56:03,915 --> 01:56:06,959
He was traveling with an
old Injun and a squaw...

1087
01:56:07,210 --> 01:56:09,462
...and some old lady
and a scrawny girl.

1088
01:56:10,255 --> 01:56:14,050
Had to be him. He had this scar
right on his face, right here.

1089
01:56:14,760 --> 01:56:17,053
I wasn't about to face him down alone.

1090
01:56:18,597 --> 01:56:20,556
Mm-hm.

1091
01:56:21,933 --> 01:56:24,727
You men get them horses out of sight.

1092
01:56:27,606 --> 01:56:31,150
If Josey Wales comes back here,
we'll buy him a drink.

1093
01:57:14,778 --> 01:57:16,696
Kansas was all...

1094
01:57:17,322 --> 01:57:20,700
...golden and smelled like sunshine.

1095
01:57:22,452 --> 01:57:23,619
Yeah.

1096
01:57:24,621 --> 01:57:27,957
I always heard there were three
kinds of suns in Kansas.

1097
01:57:28,625 --> 01:57:30,126
Sunshine...

1098
01:57:30,794 --> 01:57:32,211
...sunflowers...

1099
01:57:32,462 --> 01:57:34,296
...and sons of bitches.

1100
01:57:38,135 --> 01:57:41,470
Well, at least we're known
for something.

1101
01:57:45,475 --> 01:57:47,810
I heard a joke about Missouri once.

1102
01:57:48,311 --> 01:57:51,313
Something about how people
from Missouri...

1103
01:57:51,565 --> 01:57:54,483
...are always saying, "Show me. "

1104
01:57:55,485 --> 01:57:57,820
- Do you know it?
- No.

1105
01:57:58,029 --> 01:57:59,447
I think it was:

1106
01:58:03,076 --> 01:58:05,578
What does a man from Missouri say...

1107
01:58:05,829 --> 01:58:09,999
...if someone asks him to see a
Missouri mule?

1108
01:58:11,001 --> 01:58:13,669
- And?
- He says, "Show me. "

1109
01:58:16,173 --> 01:58:17,506
Get it?

1110
01:58:17,841 --> 01:58:20,843
They teach dumb jokes
to pretty girls in Kansas.

1111
01:58:23,555 --> 01:58:25,347
They teach other things.

1112
01:58:33,356 --> 01:58:34,857
Show me.

1113
01:59:12,229 --> 01:59:13,729
Pa!

1114
01:59:49,432 --> 01:59:51,475
You're up kind of early, aren't you?

1115
01:59:54,479 --> 01:59:56,480
It's been nice riding with you.

1116
01:59:57,566 --> 01:59:58,607
Same here.

1117
01:59:59,609 --> 02:00:03,863
When you get to town, get some nice
dresses for the ladies, you hear?

1118
02:00:04,698 --> 02:00:05,865
I will.

1119
02:00:06,449 --> 02:00:10,494
Get something specially nice for Laura
Lee for when I come back in the spring.

1120
02:00:16,126 --> 02:00:17,501
Yeah.

1121
02:00:17,961 --> 02:00:20,087
Or the following spring.

1122
02:00:22,674 --> 02:00:23,799
Yeah.

1123
02:00:25,969 --> 02:00:28,721
Sometimes trouble just follows a man.

1124
02:00:29,723 --> 02:00:32,308
Hell, I've been here way
too long as it-

1125
02:00:39,024 --> 02:00:40,816
I reckon so.

1126
02:01:09,679 --> 02:01:11,764
Josey Wales!

1127
02:02:32,095 --> 02:02:34,930
You're all alone now, Wales.

1128
02:02:36,599 --> 02:02:38,350
Not quite alone.

1129
02:03:19,017 --> 02:03:22,770
Now we're really going to show
these palefaces something!

1130
02:03:22,979 --> 02:03:24,063
No offense.

1131
02:03:24,314 --> 02:03:25,647
None taken.

1132
02:03:25,857 --> 02:03:30,027
These freebooters are
a slander to Kansas...

1133
02:03:30,320 --> 02:03:33,197
...attacking innocent women like this.

1134
02:08:02,550 --> 02:08:03,633
Josey!

1135
02:09:04,320 --> 02:09:08,615
The bullets were flying
and people running every which way.

1136
02:09:08,825 --> 02:09:12,160
Church bells were ringing.
Me and Miss Rose were ducking for cover.

1137
02:09:12,370 --> 02:09:15,122
Because one didn't know where
the shots were coming-

1138
02:09:22,630 --> 02:09:24,339
Mr. Wilson!

1139
02:09:24,882 --> 02:09:26,049
Good morning.

1140
02:09:26,342 --> 02:09:28,927
Hello, Mr. Wilson.

1141
02:09:29,345 --> 02:09:31,346
We were just telling a little story...

1142
02:09:31,639 --> 02:09:35,350
...about an outlaw passed through
this way a while back.

1143
02:09:35,685 --> 02:09:37,769
I don't suppose you'd know
about him but-

1144
02:09:38,020 --> 02:09:42,274
These two fellows down here
is Texas Rangers.

1145
02:09:42,692 --> 02:09:46,528
Been on his trail, along with this
other fellow over here.

1146
02:09:46,779 --> 02:09:48,780
What did you say your name was,
friend?

1147
02:09:54,370 --> 02:09:58,665
- My name is Fletcher.
- That's right, Mr. Fletcher.

1148
02:09:59,250 --> 02:10:01,793
Anyway, they've been chasing
this outlaw...

1149
02:10:02,044 --> 02:10:06,214
...and it just so happens old Ten Spot
here knows all about it.

1150
02:10:06,466 --> 02:10:07,883
Yes, sir.

1151
02:10:08,176 --> 02:10:12,053
It was down in Monterey, Mexico,
a little while back.

1152
02:10:12,472 --> 02:10:14,222
Anyway, this outlaw fellow...

1153
02:10:14,599 --> 02:10:17,184
...he went up against five
pistoleros.

1154
02:10:17,560 --> 02:10:20,562
He got three of them
before they cut him down.

1155
02:10:21,189 --> 02:10:22,481
Is that right, Miss Rose?

1156
02:10:22,732 --> 02:10:25,609
That's right. His name was...

1157
02:10:26,611 --> 02:10:27,944
...Josey Wales.

1158
02:10:28,237 --> 02:10:31,239
Yeah, that's it. Josey Wales.

1159
02:10:33,743 --> 02:10:36,578
If that's what happened,
then Josey Wales must be dead.

1160
02:10:38,080 --> 02:10:39,581
He is dead.

1161
02:10:40,082 --> 02:10:43,001
He sure is dead.

1162
02:10:46,130 --> 02:10:47,422
Dead, all right.

1163
02:10:52,762 --> 02:10:54,429
Will you sign this affidavit?

1164
02:10:55,097 --> 02:10:57,807
Sign? I sure will.

1165
02:11:14,450 --> 02:11:15,742
That's it.

1166
02:11:23,793 --> 02:11:25,669
Nice seeing you, Mr. Wilson.

1167
02:11:31,676 --> 02:11:34,386
Must be 5000 lawmen
in Texas right now.

1168
02:11:34,637 --> 02:11:35,679
Can't get them all.

1169
02:11:35,972 --> 02:11:38,014
I guess that's the truth.

1170
02:11:38,975 --> 02:11:41,351
You fellows get back up this way,
stop in.

1171
02:11:41,644 --> 02:11:44,312
I reckon we won't be coming
back this way.

1172
02:11:49,652 --> 02:11:52,654
I don't believe that story
about Josey Wales.

1173
02:11:52,905 --> 02:11:54,197
You don't?

1174
02:11:54,657 --> 02:11:56,491
No, sir, I don't.

1175
02:11:57,201 --> 02:12:01,329
I don't believe no five pistoleros
could do in Josey Wales.

1176
02:12:02,331 --> 02:12:04,082
Maybe it was six.

1177
02:12:04,333 --> 02:12:05,834
Could have even been 10.

1178
02:12:07,503 --> 02:12:08,920
I think he's still alive.

1179
02:12:09,171 --> 02:12:11,673
Alive? No sir.

1180
02:12:19,015 --> 02:12:22,809
I think I'll go down to Mexico
to try to find him.

1181
02:12:30,943 --> 02:12:32,027
And then?

1182
02:12:41,037 --> 02:12:43,204
He's got the first move.

1183
02:12:43,914 --> 02:12:45,373
I owe him that.

1184
02:12:47,460 --> 02:12:49,711
I'll try to tell him the war is over.

1185
02:13:06,395 --> 02:13:07,729
What do you say, Mr. Wilson?

1186
02:13:15,446 --> 02:13:17,072
I reckon so.

1187
02:13:24,163 --> 02:13:27,082
I guess we all died a little
in that damn war.
