00:00:34,231 --> 00:00:36,266
- You know, high school to college,

4
00:00:36,267 --> 00:00:37,575
it can be a big transition,

5
00:00:37,576 --> 00:00:39,569
especially if you're not from the city,

6
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,238
so-- so we try to help out
with that transition

7
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,740
in a number of ways.

8
00:00:43,741 --> 00:00:45,414
Wow, that's a real accomplishment.

9
00:00:45,415 --> 00:00:46,743
Congratulations.

10
00:00:46,744 --> 00:00:48,912
I mean, you're not in yet, but...

11
00:00:48,913 --> 00:00:50,392
no, things are looking pretty good.

12
00:00:50,393 --> 00:00:52,649
We dc an all-campus picnic,
which is a nice way

13
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,819
for the incoming students
to acclimate themselves

14
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,354
to the college.

15
00:00:58,355 --> 00:01:01,257
For me, the mos! exciting thing
about this place is the classes'

16
00:01:01,258 --> 00:01:02,931
So you don'! want to go
lo college?

17
00:01:02,932 --> 00:01:06,374
You know, I'm not up to date
on the course catalog.

18
00:01:07,765 --> 00:01:10,600
One of the great things
about this school is, you know,

19
00:01:10,601 --> 00:01:13,036
you have a campus called New York City.

20
00:01:13,037 --> 00:01:14,948
Greatest city in the world, they say.

21
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:17,273
I thought your nay was-
was interesting.

22
00:01:17,274 --> 00:01:19,876
A spell-check might be nice
on than essays.

23
00:01:19,877 --> 00:01:21,447
Planning on taking your boards again?

24
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:22,890
Love those extracurriculars.

25
00:01:22,891 --> 00:01:25,448
Have you heard about the meal plan?

26
00:01:25,449 --> 00:01:26,883
Fantastic'

27
00:01:26,884 --> 00:01:28,454
Where do you see things going, you know,

28
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:30,591
after-after college?

29
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:33,783

- Mine.

45
00:03:27,905 --> 00:03:29,407
You can have it if you want, though.

46
00:03:32,876 --> 00:03:34,444
- Is that a new shirt?

47
00:03:34,445 --> 00:03:36,512
- Uh, yeah, it is.

48
00:03:36,513 --> 00:03:37,753
Do you like it?

00:03:37,754 --> 00:03:39,182
- Don'! ask me that.

50
00:03:39,183 --> 00:03:40,416

00:03:40,417 --> 00:03:41,851

00:04:47,117 --> 00:04:48,317
- Hello?

75
00:04:48,318 --> 00:04:49,592
- Jesse Fisher'?

76
00:04:49,593 --> 00:04:50,653
- Yeah?

77
00:04:50,654 --> 00:04:51,997
- It's your favorite Communist.

78
00:04:51,998 --> 00:04:53,366
- Professor Peter Hoberg?

79
00:04:53,367 --> 00:04:55,224
- Screw you.
I'm not a Communist

80
00:04:55,225 --> 00:04:56,325
How you doing?

81
00:04:56,326 --> 00:04:57,827
- Oh, you know.

82
00:04:57,828 --> 00:05:00,897
- Listen, I don't want in
lake up too much of your time,

83
00:05:00,898 --> 00:05:02,172
but here's why I'm calling.

84
00:05:02,173 --> 00:05:04,009
Ever since I announced that I was packing it in,

85
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,235
funny, but this whole place has finally decided

86
00:05:06,236 --> 00:05:07,909
that they don'! really hate me
after all.

87
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,606
Now, I know Ohio is not
as glamorous as New York,

88
00:05:10,607 --> 00:05:12,951
but they're throwing me
a retirement dinner thing

89
00:05:12,952 --> 00:05:14,251
at the end of the month,

90
00:05:14,252 --> 00:05:16,546
and they asked me to invite any former students

91
00:05:16,547 --> 00:05:18,857
that might want to lie and say
some nice things about me.

92
00:05:18,858 --> 00:05:21,551
And since you're one of
the great liars that I know...

93
00:05:21,552 --> 00:05:22,718
- When is it?

94
00:05:22,719 --> 00:05:23,857
- Weekend of the 25th.

95
00:05:23,858 --> 00:05:25,621
You know, check your schedule.

96
00:05:25,622 --> 00:05:27,623
- OK!!-

97
00:05:27,624 --> 00:05:30,393
Checking now.

98
00:05:30,394 --> 00:05:37,166
Uh, looks like I'd have to shift
some things around, but yeah.

99
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:39,340
I'll be there.

100
00:06:12,736 --> 00:06:14,579
- Hi.

101
00:06:16,874 --> 00:06:18,040
Look at this.

102
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:19,918
Haw are you?

103
00:06:30,754 --> 00:06:32,097
Ah.

104
00:07:04,554 --> 00:07:06,088
- Jesse.
- Yeah, hi.

105
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:07,723
- Hi, I'm David.
This is Susan.

106
00:07:07,724 --> 00:07:08,824
- Hi.
- Hey.

107
00:07:08,825 --> 00:07:10,294
- Peter warned you that we'd be here?

108
00:07:10,294 --> 00:07:11,295
- He did.
He did, yeah.

109
00:07:12,763 --> 00:07:14,731
We're making him take care
of us while we're here.

110
00:07:14,731 --> 00:07:15,971
How was your drive?

111
00:07:15,972 --> 00:07:17,673
- It was good, yeah.
Pleasant, actually,

112
00:07:17,674 --> 00:07:19,402
- Peter, Jesse's here!

113
00:07:19,403 --> 00:07:20,609
- So it's good to be back?

114
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:21,844
- Yeah.
Yeah, ifs weird.

115
00:07:21,845 --> 00:07:22,976
I drove up the hill.

116
00:07:22,977 --> 00:07:24,408
I suddenly felt like I was seeing

117
00:07:24,408 --> 00:07:25,751
an ex-girlfriend
or something.

118
00:07:25,752 --> 00:07:28,044
- The one that got away.
- Exactly.

119
00:07:28,045 --> 00:07:29,779
- Zibby loves it here so much,

120
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,157
she get sad to come home on breaks.

121
00:07:31,158 --> 00:07:32,248
- Zibby?

122
00:07:32,249 --> 00:07:33,650
- Sorry.
Elizabeth, our daughter.

123
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:34,788
a sophomore.
- Ah.

124
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:35,855
- She's in the improv group.

125
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:37,331
We came up to see one of her shows.

126
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,955
- How was it?
- Hilarious.

127
00:07:38,956 --> 00:07:41,457
- Uh, filthy but hilarious.

128
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:42,959
- Sc how do you guys know Peter?

129
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,694
- He was my camp counselor.

130
00:07:44,695 --> 00:07:46,228
- No way.

131
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:49,432
- He made us sing pro-union
songs around the campfire.

132
00:07:49,433 --> 00:07:51,500
# <i>You mus! stand up
for your brother</i> #

133
00:07:51,501 --> 00:07:54,003
# <i>So you won't die for the man</i> #

134
00:07:54,004 --> 00:07:56,706
# <i>Stand up for your brother
so you won't die for-</i> #

135
00:07:56,707 --> 00:07:58,507
He never writes.
He never calls,

136
00:07:58,508 --> 00:08:00,276
- Oh, hey.

137
00:08:00,277 --> 00:08:02,011
- Let me look at you.

138
00:08:02,012 --> 00:08:03,512
Not bad.

139
00:08:03,513 --> 00:08:05,247
Who's hungry?

140
00:08:05,248 --> 00:08:06,949
- I'm hungry-
- okay, let's go.

141
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,361
We've got reservations.

142
00:08:10,554 --> 00:08:12,321
Oh, man, 37 years.

143
00:08:12,322 --> 00:08:13,689
Can you believe it?

144
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:18,160
Native New Yorker spends 37 years in a county

145
00:08:18,161 --> 00:08:20,496
where the tallest building's nine stories.

146
00:08:20,497 --> 00:08:23,366
Oh, my.

147
00:08:23,367 --> 00:08:25,210
- How are you feeling about it all'!

148
00:08:25,211 --> 00:08:26,340
- The retirement?
- Yeah.

149
00:08:26,341 --> 00:08:28,137
- Oh, I don't know.

150
00:08:28,138 --> 00:08:30,006
Another year of faculty meetings,

151
00:08:30,007 --> 00:08:33,209
I'd throw myself
off that nine-story building.

152
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:37,446
the admissions game, buddy?

153
00:08:37,447 --> 00:08:40,223
- "How's
the admissions game, buddy?"

154
00:08:41,451 --> 00:08:43,021
Whoa, is that Professor Fairfield?

155
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,053
- Yeah.

156
00:08:44,054 --> 00:08:46,055
- Wow, she looks fantastic!

157
00:08:46,056 --> 00:08:47,456
Professor!

158
00:08:47,457 --> 00:08:49,358
What is she like?
Is she cool?

159
00:08:49,359 --> 00:08:50,926
- She's definitely not warm.

160
00:08:50,927 --> 00:08:54,130
- I loved her British Romantic lit class.

161
00:08:54,131 --> 00:08:56,465
She was, like, the belt teacher I had here.

162
00:08:56,466 --> 00:08:59,675
She was, like, the second best
teacher I had here.

163
00:09:01,571 --> 00:09:03,239
- Unbelievable.

164
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,940
You are unbelievable.

165
00:09:04,941 --> 00:09:06,181
- What?

166
00:09:15,852 --> 00:09:17,263
- Tell her how you feel,

167
00:09:21,024 --> 00:09:22,503
- Jesse, this is my daughter, Zibby.

168
00:09:22,504 --> 00:09:23,559
. HO)'-

169
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,428
- Hi.
Hello.

170
00:09:25,429 --> 00:09:26,908
- Peter, should we follow you?

171
00:09:26,909 --> 00:09:28,638
- If you think that's wise.

172
00:09:32,235 --> 00:09:35,237
- And he's like, "I had it
up to here with America

173
00:09:35,238 --> 00:09:37,411
and its repressive, regressive,
fascist, “ whatever.

174
00:09:37,412 --> 00:09:38,943
- I sound like that'?
That's how I sound?

175
00:09:38,944 --> 00:09:40,114
- You do.
You sound like that

176
00:09:40,115 --> 00:09:41,511
And he gets up in front of the class.

177
00:09:41,511 --> 00:09:43,286
He says, 'I just-l couldn't
take it anymore,

178
00:09:43,287 --> 00:09:47,283
so I picked up my life,
and I moved to France."

179
00:09:47,284 --> 00:09:49,457
- This is being ludicrously
misreported, by the way.

180
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:50,786
- So I raised my hand.

181
00:09:50,787 --> 00:09:52,630
I said, 'Wait, wail, wait, wait, wail, Peter.

182
00:09:52,631 --> 00:09:55,424
"You're telling us you got
so angry at this country

183
00:09:55,425 --> 00:09:58,294
that you moved to France?"

184
00:09:58,295 --> 00:10:01,130
And Peter says, "Yeah.

185
00:10:01,131 --> 00:10:02,269
Well, I had a Fulbright."

186
00:10:03,967 --> 00:10:05,310
- Yeah, well, yeah, if I told you

187
00:10:05,311 --> 00:10:06,940
what this putz was like when he was here,

188
00:10:06,941 --> 00:10:08,143
he'd run out of the room crying.

189
00:10:08,144 --> 00:10:09,412
- That's probably true.

190
00:10:09,413 --> 00:10:11,317
- Well, what were you like when you were here?

191
00:10:11,318 --> 00:10:14,543
- I wan very handsome, wasn't I?

192
00:10:14,544 --> 00:10:15,852
Am I remembering that correctly?

193
00:10:15,853 --> 00:10:17,120
- No, I don't remember that.

194
00:10:17,121 --> 00:10:19,315
But what I do remember is you being a real jerk

195
00:10:19,316 --> 00:10:21,317
in your parents on graduation weekend.

196
00:10:21,318 --> 00:10:22,685
He didn't want to leave.

197
00:10:22,686 --> 00:10:23,953
- Ifs true.

198
00:10:23,954 --> 00:10:26,822
And I blamed my parents,
weirdly, all four of them.

199
00:10:26,823 --> 00:10:28,792
Like it was their fault college was ending.

200
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:29,930
- Don'! do that to us.

201
00:10:29,931 --> 00:10:32,094
- No, I won't.
- She says that now.

202
00:10:32,095 --> 00:10:35,464
- So your parents told me
you're in the improv group?

203
00:10:35,465 --> 00:10:36,632
- Yeah.

204
00:10:36,633 --> 00:10:37,700
- How's that?

205
00:10:37,701 --> 00:10:39,468
- We the best I love it

206
00:10:39,469 --> 00:10:40,777
- What do you love about it'?

207
00:10:40,778 --> 00:10:45,341
- Um, I think I love how terrifying it is

208
00:10:45,342 --> 00:10:48,677
and haw you have in say "yes" to everything.

209
00:10:48,678 --> 00:10:50,679
- Uh, sorry, what does that moan?

210
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,318
- Ifs, like, the only rule of improv.

211
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:53,623
You can never say "no."

212
00:10:53,624 --> 00:10:56,685
You have to say "yes" and then add something.

213
00:10:56,686 --> 00:10:59,255
Like, uh-like, look.

214
00:10:59,256 --> 00:11:01,790
Um, okay, Mom, you and I

215
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,126
have been wandering in the desert for days,

216
00:11:04,127 --> 00:11:06,028
and we're about to die, okay'?

217
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:07,263
- OK!!-

218
00:11:07,264 --> 00:11:12,270
- Okay, and I say, "Hand me that lemonade, “

219
00:11:14,704 --> 00:11:17,048
So hand me that lemonade.

220
00:11:19,543 --> 00:11:22,077
- Jesus, Susan, hand her the goddamn lemonade.

221
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:23,212
- Never mind.

222
00:11:23,213 --> 00:11:26,057
Jesse, hand me that lemonade.

223
00:11:27,217 --> 00:11:28,992
Thank you.

224
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,221
M mm-

225
00:11:32,222 --> 00:11:33,565
Sweet, just the way I like it.

226
00:11:33,566 --> 00:11:34,900
- I nailed this.

227
00:11:39,162 --> 00:11:40,232
- It doesn't make sense.

228
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:41,564
We're in the desert

229
00:11:41,565 --> 00:11:44,045
I mean, where would we get lemonade?

230
00:11:46,937 --> 00:11:48,211
- It's great seeing you guys.

231
00:11:48,212 --> 00:11:49,582
- So what was your major'?

232
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,041
- I was English with a minor in history,

233
00:11:52,042 --> 00:11:53,953
just to make sure I was fully unemployable.

234
00:11:53,954 --> 00:11:55,423
- Right.
- What about you?

235
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:56,512
- Drama.

236
00:11:56,513 --> 00:11:57,914
I mean, not officially yet,

237
00:11:57,914 --> 00:12:00,019
'cause my dad's not totally
thrilled with the idea,

238
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,751
so maybe also art history?

239
00:12:02,752 --> 00:12:04,920
- I'm just happy you go to clan occasionally.

240
00:12:04,921 --> 00:12:07,026
I thought maybe you just
improvised all day long.

241
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:08,424
- Nope.

242
00:12:08,425 --> 00:12:09,792
I mean, I do, I guess.

243
00:12:09,793 --> 00:12:11,238
Have you ever thought about that'!

244
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:12,394
- About what?

245
00:12:12,395 --> 00:12:15,030
- How everything in life
is basically improvised?

246
00:12:15,031 --> 00:12:16,332
There's no script.

247
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:19,368
We're just making this up as we go.

248
00:12:19,369 --> 00:12:20,703
- That's true.

249
00:12:20,704 --> 00:12:21,804
- So yeah.

250
00:12:21,805 --> 00:12:24,240
Well, improv is deep, man.

251
00:12:24,241 --> 00:12:25,709
- Well, we're about in head out
- Oh.

252
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:27,780
- Pleasure to meet you, Jesse.
- Yeah. yeah. you too.

253
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:29,080
- Take care.
Bye.

254
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,683
- So I'll-
I'll see you around, I guess.

255
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:32,748
- Yeah, yeah, see you around.
- Okay.

256
00:12:32,749 --> 00:12:33,887
- It was nice to meet you.

257
00:12:33,888 --> 00:12:35,451
- Yeah, you too.

258
00:12:35,452 --> 00:12:37,728
- See you later.
- Okay, bye.

259
00:12:41,258 --> 00:12:43,260
. Enjoy college.

260
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,603
- You wearing a tie tonight'?

261
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:54,976
' Huh?

262
00:12:57,107 --> 00:12:58,711
- What can you say, really?

263
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:03,579
People get up and say
all this great stuff about you.

264
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,980
You know, I'm thinking,

265
00:13:04,981 --> 00:13:06,824
'Who in the hell
are they talking about?"

266
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,792
We just, where does the lime go?

267
00:13:16,793 --> 00:13:17,999
This seems impossible.

268
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,428
37 years.

269
00:13:19,429 --> 00:13:21,773
37.

270
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:25,340
There comes a time in a man's life

271
00:13:25,341 --> 00:13:27,645
when it hurts to do the math.

272
00:13:34,844 --> 00:13:38,180
You know, I worry that I've been hero so long

273
00:13:38,181 --> 00:13:42,027
that I'll be lousy being anyplace else.

274
00:13:43,353 --> 00:13:47,699
Oh, well, I guess I'll find out very shortly.

275
00:13:59,369 --> 00:14:02,805
Um, hey, thanks for the chicken.

276
00:14:02,806 --> 00:14:06,049
It was a little cold, but still I...

277
00:14:08,144 --> 00:14:10,979
Think nice thoughts about me when I'm gone,

278
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,358
if you can.

279
00:14:19,656 --> 00:14:22,024
- No, they did it at Macalester.

280
00:14:22,025 --> 00:14:23,402
I really think it could work here.

281
00:14:23,403 --> 00:14:24,827
- Well, it sounds great.

282
00:14:24,828 --> 00:14:27,329
I tell you, talk about it on Monday.

283
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,498
- Oh, sure.

284
00:14:29,499 --> 00:14:30,799
Night, Jesse'

285
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,404
- Yeah, good night.

286
00:14:34,637 --> 00:14:35,911
- It's a good idea, though.

287
00:14:37,374 --> 00:14:39,547
a terrible idea.

288
00:14:42,245 --> 00:14:45,013
Oh, what a disaster.

289
00:14:45,014 --> 00:14:47,516
- What-no, it was nice

290
00:14:47,517 --> 00:14:50,020
- You're not half the liar you used to be.

291
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,924
You know, it really means a lot to me

292
00:14:55,925 --> 00:14:57,131
that you came out for this.

293
00:14:57,132 --> 00:14:58,431
- How could I miss it'?

294
00:14:58,432 --> 00:15:00,135
You're the second best teacher I had here.

295
00:15:00,136 --> 00:15:02,371
- I'm serious.

296
00:15:06,903 --> 00:15:08,437
I'm gonna take off.

297
00:15:08,438 --> 00:15:09,610
- Well, I'll come with you.

298
00:15:09,611 --> 00:15:11,440
- Oh, no, no, no, you slay.

299
00:15:11,441 --> 00:15:13,580
I want to be alone for a bit.

300
00:15:40,003 --> 00:15:42,237
- I feel you, man.

301
00:15:42,238 --> 00:15:45,481
A lot of information in trees.

302
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:50,245
- Uh...

303
00:15:50,246 --> 00:15:52,314
- How's your night going?

304
00:15:52,315 --> 00:15:53,415
- Fine.

305
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:56,652
- Is your name.

306
00:15:56,653 --> 00:15:58,787
Ethan?

307
00:15:58,788 --> 00:16:01,323
- No.
WW!

308
00:16:01,324 --> 00:16:02,825
- You look like an Ethan to me.

309
00:16:02,826 --> 00:16:04,660
- My name's not Ethan.

310
00:16:04,661 --> 00:16:06,834
- How cool would that have been
if that was your name

311
00:16:06,835 --> 00:16:08,363
and l just, like...

312
00:16:08,364 --> 00:16:10,999
Knew it?

313
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,734
Are you a student here?

314
00:16:12,735 --> 00:16:15,737
- Uh, no, but thank you tor thinking that.

315
00:16:15,738 --> 00:16:16,805
You?

316
00:16:16,806 --> 00:16:18,040
- Nah, man.

317
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:20,175
I'm just here visiting a buddy of mine.

318
00:16:20,176 --> 00:16:23,745
But it's not a bad place
to kill a little time, huh?

319
00:16:23,746 --> 00:16:25,581
I'm Nat.

320
00:16:25,582 --> 00:16:27,683
- I'm Jesse.

321
00:16:27,684 --> 00:16:30,018
- Do you hear that music, Ethan?

322
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:32,654
It sounds like a celebration.

323
00:16:32,655 --> 00:16:34,923
I say we do a little sherlocking,

324
00:16:34,924 --> 00:16:37,125
find out where ifs coming from going on.

325
00:16:37,126 --> 00:16:39,528
- No-
- Don't say no.

326
00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:42,009
Fortune never smiles on those who say no.

327
00:16:47,604 --> 00:16:50,038
# <i>Everybody get on the floor</i> #

328
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:52,207
# <i>Everybody wanna uh-uh-uh</i> #

329
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,710
# <i>Everybody get on the floor</i> #

330
00:16:54,711 --> 00:16:56,678
# <i>Everybody wanna uh-uh-uh</i> #

331
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:58,180
# <i>Everybody 901-"</i> #

332
00:16:58,181 --> 00:17:01,416
- I would get you a beer,
but alcohol's for suckers, man.

333
00:17:01,417 --> 00:17:02,818
- Uh, yeah.

334
00:17:02,819 --> 00:17:04,887
Listen, Nat, this isn't really my scene anymore.

335
00:17:04,888 --> 00:17:06,355
I'm gonna-

336
00:17:06,356 --> 00:17:08,495
- Give yourself five minutes
to adapt, my brother.

337
00:17:08,496 --> 00:17:10,893
Change is never easy.

338
00:17:19,903 --> 00:17:22,070
Tell me this.

339
00:17:22,071 --> 00:17:25,240
What are your thoughts on crop circles?

340
00:17:25,241 --> 00:17:27,342
- Uh, I don't have any.

341
00:17:27,343 --> 00:17:31,113
some seriously weird shit going on, bro.

342
00:17:31,114 --> 00:17:33,116
You think it's just a bunch
of drunk English guys

343
00:17:33,117 --> 00:17:34,449
with planks and rope?

344
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:36,285
You're a fool.
- Mm-hmm.

345
00:17:36,286 --> 00:17:39,221
- Spend some time with those patterns.

346
00:17:39,222 --> 00:17:41,089
You can feel it.

347
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:44,259
Somethings trying to communicate with us.

348
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:48,697
It should be on the front page
of every paper every day.

349
00:17:48,698 --> 00:17:51,199
- Okay.
Thanks.

350
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,301
- Ha?

351
00:17:52,302 --> 00:17:54,102
I thought that was you,

352
00:17:54,103 --> 00:17:56,271
- Hi.
- How'd you and up here?

353
00:17:56,272 --> 00:17:57,546
- He made a friend.

354
00:17:57,547 --> 00:17:59,775
- Yeah, yeah, I-yeah

355
00:17:59,776 --> 00:18:01,209
- Look at you.

356
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,779
You're, like, back in college.

357
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,880
- Whee!

358
00:18:04,881 --> 00:18:06,155
- How does it feel?

359
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,684
- Oh, this is Vanessa.

360
00:18:08,685 --> 00:18:10,218

- Tm Nat

00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,489
- Jesse's an alum.

363
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:13,796
We had brunch this morning.

364
00:18:13,797 --> 00:18:15,958
I think my mom has a little crush on him.

365
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:17,165
- You went here?

366
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,226
- I did, yeah

367
00:18:18,227 --> 00:18:19,628
- When'd you graduate?

368
00:18:19,629 --> 00:18:22,508
- Oh, man, it was, uh, -.

369
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,635
That was when we were born.

370
00:18:26,636 --> 00:18:28,770
- Yeah, yeah

371
00:18:28,771 --> 00:18:30,472
I'm old.

372
00:18:30,473 --> 00:18:32,316
- But you look good.

373
00:18:34,077 --> 00:18:36,648
And you're overdressed.

374
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:51,293
# <i>Hotter, sweeter, taller...</i> #

375
00:18:51,294 --> 00:18:53,061
- That's better.

376
00:18:53,062 --> 00:18:54,997
# <i>Hotter, sweeter</i> #

377
00:18:54,998 --> 00:18:57,432
- Why do I like this guy so much?

378
00:18:57,433 --> 00:18:59,504
- Because he's likable.

379
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,804

I'm gonna take off.

381
00:19:05,116 --> 00:19:06,348
- No, you should slay.

382
00:19:06,349 --> 00:19:08,510
- No, really, I should go.

383
00:19:08,511 --> 00:19:10,912
- Do you drink coffee?

00:19:54,724 --> 00:19:57,859
- Don'! sweat that guy.

405
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:01,029
She only had eyes for you.

406
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,898
- OK!!-

407
00:20:02,899 --> 00:20:04,399
Good night, Nat

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,710
- Good night, Ethan.

409
00:20:57,954 --> 00:21:00,088
- Can I help you?

410
00:21:00,089 --> 00:21:01,423
. Surf!-

411
00:21:01,424 --> 00:21:03,125
I just-

412
00:21:03,126 --> 00:21:04,793
just the best book of all time.

413
00:21:04,794 --> 00:21:08,130
I just like holding it, I guess

414
00:21:08,131 --> 00:21:09,865
- Best book of all time?

415
00:21:09,866 --> 00:21:11,334
- Well, one of them, sure.

416
00:21:11,334 --> 00:21:13,314
- Have you ever noticed how everyone around here

417
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:15,270
speaks in wild hyperbole?

418
00:21:15,271 --> 00:21:16,605
Everything's the best.

419
00:21:16,606 --> 00:21:18,807
Like, 'He's the best professor ever, '

420
00:21:18,808 --> 00:21:21,443
or, "This is the best patty" melt
on the planet, “

421
00:21:21,444 --> 00:21:23,287
as if they've sampled every possible variety

422
00:21:23,288 --> 00:21:24,980
of professor and patty melt,

423
00:21:24,981 --> 00:21:28,258
which is, as we know, logistically impossible.

424
00:21:33,322 --> 00:21:34,960
- ORGY-

425
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,001
- All right, do we have enough time for that'?

426
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:45,167
- Hey.
- Hey.

427
00:21:45,168 --> 00:21:46,169
- Am I super lab?

428
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,669
- Uh, no.
You wan! a coffee?

429
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:50,672
- No, I'll just drink yours.

430
00:21:50,673 --> 00:21:52,107
- You okay?

431
00:21:52,108 --> 00:21:54,452
- I don't know yet

432
00:21:58,848 --> 00:22:01,454
I smell like beer.
Do you smell that'?

433
00:22:03,386 --> 00:22:05,525
- Yeah, actually, you do.

434
00:22:08,157 --> 00:22:12,027
- I-I need to excuse myself
just-

435
00:22:12,028 --> 00:22:14,269
just for a-

436
00:22:25,808 --> 00:22:27,709
- Sorry about that.

437
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:29,945
Back there.

438
00:22:29,946 --> 00:22:31,721
You walked away, and I was just wondering

439
00:22:31,722 --> 00:22:36,151
why I was being rude to someone
who loves the same writer I do.

440
00:22:36,152 --> 00:22:39,221
And I don'! have an answer
for that

441
00:22:39,222 --> 00:22:40,326
- OK!!-

442
00:22:41,557 --> 00:22:43,725
- Okay, so yeah, um,

443
00:22:43,726 --> 00:22:44,860
I'll just-

444
00:22:44,861 --> 00:22:47,329
- My grades tanked senior year.

445
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:50,065
That book was the only thing I wanted to read.

446
00:22:50,066 --> 00:22:51,366
You liking it?

447
00:22:51,367 --> 00:22:54,603
- Uh, yeah.

448
00:22:54,604 --> 00:22:56,515
It's my second time reading it, actually.

449
00:22:56,516 --> 00:22:57,672
- WWI.

450
00:22:57,673 --> 00:22:58,708
That's impressive.

451
00:22:58,709 --> 00:22:59,841
Ifs not short.

452
00:22:59,842 --> 00:23:01,048
- Yeah, I know.

453
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:02,681
- You know, he said the purpose of fiction

454
00:23:02,682 --> 00:23:04,246
was to combat loneliness.

455
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:05,914
good.

456
00:23:05,915 --> 00:23:07,315
I never heard that.

457
00:23:07,316 --> 00:23:08,383
- Yeah.

458
00:23:08,384 --> 00:23:09,918
Well, on the other hand,

459
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,160
spending most of your time
with an 1,100-page book

460
00:23:12,161 --> 00:23:14,100
tends to put a dent in your social life.

461
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:16,191
- Yeah.

462
00:23:16,192 --> 00:23:20,695
Loneliness simultaneously
increased and decreased.

463
00:23:20,696 --> 00:23:22,530
. HO)'-

464
00:23:22,531 --> 00:23:24,466
- What, you guys know each other?

465
00:23:24,467 --> 00:23:27,269
- Yeah, we had Symbolic Logic first semester.

466
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,770
Zibby.

467
00:23:28,771 --> 00:23:30,872
- Right.
Dean, hi.

468
00:23:30,873 --> 00:23:32,607
- Hey.
- I'm Joan, by the way.

469
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:34,110
- OK!!-

470
00:23:36,479 --> 00:23:38,113
- Hmm.

471
00:23:38,114 --> 00:23:39,614
Interesting guy.

472
00:23:39,615 --> 00:23:40,782
- Yeah.

473
00:23:40,783 --> 00:23:43,018
I can'! believe
he's even back here.

474
00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:44,786
- Why?
What do you moan?

475
00:23:44,787 --> 00:23:47,622
- He had a manic episode last year.

476
00:23:47,623 --> 00:23:49,925
Eventually, they look him lo a hospital

477
00:23:49,926 --> 00:23:52,794
and, I don't know, calmed him down, I guess.

478
00:23:52,795 --> 00:23:54,968
He's supposed to be, like,
the smartest guy ever.

479
00:23:57,466 --> 00:23:58,638
- Everything okay?

480
00:23:58,639 --> 00:24:01,102
- Yeah, everything's great.

481
00:24:01,103 --> 00:24:02,604
I puked.

482
00:24:02,605 --> 00:24:03,972
- On.

483
00:24:03,973 --> 00:24:05,145
- That's gross.

484
00:24:05,146 --> 00:24:06,620
Sorry, you did not need to hear that

485
00:24:06,621 --> 00:24:08,589
Come on, let's-let's walk.

486
00:24:13,149 --> 00:24:14,628
My parents really liked you.

487
00:24:14,629 --> 00:24:15,917
- Oh.
nice.

488
00:24:15,918 --> 00:24:18,053
I like them.

489
00:24:18,054 --> 00:24:20,588
You're really lucky to have parents like that.

490
00:24:20,589 --> 00:24:22,123
- Like what?

491
00:24:22,124 --> 00:24:23,825
- Like, I don't know.

492
00:24:23,826 --> 00:24:25,994
Around, first of all.

493
00:24:25,995 --> 00:24:28,763
Still together so they
can fret over you as a team.

494
00:24:28,764 --> 00:24:30,332
- Yeah, I guess.

495
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:33,001
I like them best when they're
not being so parental,

496
00:24:33,002 --> 00:24:36,771
which is, like, 1% of the time.

497
00:24:36,772 --> 00:24:39,441
Oh, I thought of this great trick

498
00:24:39,442 --> 00:24:40,682
for having them annoy me less.

499
00:24:40,683 --> 00:24:41,848
Want to hear if?
- Okay.

500
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:43,687
- Okay, I decided to treat my parents

501
00:24:43,688 --> 00:24:45,158
like they're always drunk.

502
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:47,115
No, really, it works.

503
00:24:47,116 --> 00:24:49,718
Any time they say something
irritating or offensive,

504
00:24:49,719 --> 00:24:52,354
I'm just like, "Oh, I can't get mad at them.

505
00:24:52,355 --> 00:24:54,356
They're drunk.
It's not their fault."

506
00:24:54,357 --> 00:24:56,633
And why should I take advice
from drunk people seriously?

507
00:24:56,634 --> 00:24:58,526
- That's great.

508
00:24:58,527 --> 00:25:00,462
- Do you like classical music?

509
00:25:00,463 --> 00:25:02,030
- Yeah, sure.

510
00:25:02,031 --> 00:25:05,200
- Okay, I took this music survey claw last year.

511
00:25:05,201 --> 00:25:07,035
Oh, my God!

512
00:25:07,036 --> 00:25:09,016
It totally changed my life.

513
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:14,976
I'm really happy I ran into you last night

514
00:25:14,977 --> 00:25:16,745
- Yeah, yeah, mo too.

515
00:25:16,746 --> 00:25:18,726
Ifs random.

516
00:25:20,383 --> 00:25:23,184
Who was that guy?

517
00:25:23,185 --> 00:25:24,719
- What guy?

518
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,287
- The-last night, that guy.

519
00:25:26,288 --> 00:25:31,226
- Oh, his name is Eric.

520
00:25:31,227 --> 00:25:33,495
- Erie

521
00:25:33,496 --> 00:25:36,064
ls Eric your fella?

522
00:25:36,065 --> 00:25:39,034
- No.

523
00:25:39,035 --> 00:25:42,303
No.

524
00:25:42,304 --> 00:25:46,841
You know, I think I like almost
everything about this place

525
00:25:46,842 --> 00:25:49,611
but the dude situation.

526
00:25:49,612 --> 00:25:51,046
- Not great?

527
00:25:51,047 --> 00:25:52,747
- No one, like, dates.

528
00:25:52,748 --> 00:25:57,385
so casual about it all.

529
00:25:57,386 --> 00:25:59,754
- Same as when I was here.

530
00:25:59,755 --> 00:26:02,891
- Yeah.

531
00:26:02,892 --> 00:26:07,432
I guess there's part of me
that's a little old-fashioned.

532
00:26:12,802 --> 00:26:14,969
- Well, on behalf

533
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:19,607
of all current and former
18- to 22-year-olds,

534
00:26:19,608 --> 00:26:22,277
I'd like to apologize.

535
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:24,045
Forgive us.

536
00:26:24,046 --> 00:26:25,880
Seriously.

537
00:26:25,881 --> 00:26:28,794
We know not what we do.

538
00:26:33,923 --> 00:26:35,129
- I think one of the things

539
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:37,358
I loved the most about being here

540
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:40,061
was the feeling that anything was possible.

541
00:26:40,062 --> 00:26:43,298
It's just infinite choices ahead of you.

542
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:47,268
You'd get out of school,
and anything could happen.

543
00:26:47,269 --> 00:26:50,672
And then you do get out, and...

544
00:26:50,673 --> 00:26:51,947
life happens, you know'?

545
00:26:51,948 --> 00:26:53,408
Decisions gel made.

546
00:26:53,409 --> 00:26:56,444
And then all those many choices
you had in from of you

547
00:26:56,445 --> 00:26:58,313
are no longer really there.

548
00:26:58,314 --> 00:26:59,918
At a certain point, you just got to go,

549
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,484
"Oh, I guess this is new its going down.

550
00:27:02,485 --> 00:27:07,155
And there's just something
a little depressing about that.

551
00:27:07,156 --> 00:27:11,459
- Well, don't you think you're
romanticizing youth a bit much?

552
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:14,162
You know, 'cause it's just as hard and annoying

553
00:27:14,163 --> 00:27:17,699
lo be young an it is to be old, I'm assuming.

554
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,146
Nut that you're old,
'cause, you know, you're not

555
00:27:20,147 --> 00:27:24,672
- Look, I get the whole
“we're all equal" argument,

556
00:27:24,673 --> 00:27:27,442
and it's kind of true,
but it's also kind of not true.

557
00:27:27,443 --> 00:27:32,347
Like, okay, I feel different now
than I felt when I was here,

558
00:27:32,348 --> 00:27:36,317
and I hate to break this lo you,
but so will you.

559
00:27:36,318 --> 00:27:38,186
- So you're saying things suck?

560
00:27:38,187 --> 00:27:40,288
I should prepare myself for suckiness?

561
00:27:40,289 --> 00:27:43,625
- No, a liberal arts education
solves all your problems.

562
00:27:43,626 --> 00:27:44,959
- Thank God!

563
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,371
- Worth every penny.

564
00:27:50,533 --> 00:27:53,001
- We should hug.

565
00:27:53,002 --> 00:27:54,435
- What?

566
00:27:54,436 --> 00:27:56,304
- I mean, we could keep talking,

567
00:27:56,305 --> 00:28:01,309
but I think it would be better if we hugged.

568
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:03,511
Come on.

569
00:28:03,512 --> 00:28:04,889
- Okay.

570
00:28:07,816 --> 00:28:09,384
Who slam'!
- I do.

571
00:28:09,385 --> 00:28:10,728
- Okay.
- Here we go.

572
00:28:23,732 --> 00:28:25,767
God, so you were here a long time ago.

573
00:28:25,768 --> 00:28:27,335
- Whoa, okay.

574
00:28:27,336 --> 00:28:29,543
- I mean-
- Enough, enough.

575
00:28:33,742 --> 00:28:36,077
That's-l mean, l just mean
because I thought,

576
00:28:36,078 --> 00:28:38,179
with the greenhouses”.

577
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:42,417
- Hey, before you go, I thought
you might like these,

578
00:28:42,418 --> 00:28:44,864
'cause I don't really need 'em
anymore and, uh, here.

579
00:28:44,865 --> 00:28:47,663
Ooh.
Look at this one.

580
00:28:50,092 --> 00:28:51,960
Huh?
No?

581
00:28:51,961 --> 00:28:53,328
- Nah.

582
00:28:53,329 --> 00:28:54,763
- Oh, please, that's a great shirt

583
00:28:54,763 --> 00:28:56,699
You know the trouble I unused in this shirt'!

584
00:28:56,699 --> 00:28:57,905
- I can only imagine,

585
00:28:57,906 --> 00:29:00,101
- You gut no taste on top of everything else.

586
00:29:00,102 --> 00:29:01,971
Oh, my God, what a beautiful shirt

587
00:29:01,972 --> 00:29:03,609
Not giving it to you anyway.
- All right

588
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:04,778
- Oh, it feels great!

589
00:29:09,345 --> 00:29:10,945
Hello?

590
00:29:10,946 --> 00:29:13,248
Oh, hi.

591
00:29:13,249 --> 00:29:16,784
No, no, he's-he's still here,

592
00:29:16,785 --> 00:29:17,991
Yeah, hold on.

593
00:29:21,123 --> 00:29:22,796
Zibby.

594
00:29:24,393 --> 00:29:25,426
- Hello?

595
00:29:25,427 --> 00:29:26,599
- You haven'! left yet.

596
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,962
- Uh, no.
- Good.

597
00:29:27,963 --> 00:29:30,465
I need to see you before you go.

598
00:29:30,466 --> 00:29:32,639
Will you meet me at the bookstore?

599
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,570
Say yes'

600
00:29:35,571 --> 00:29:38,139
- Yea.

601
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,408
ORGY

602
00:29:40,409 --> 00:29:42,150
asking about a book I recommended.

603
00:29:42,151 --> 00:29:43,177
- Hmm.

604
00:29:43,178 --> 00:29:44,384
- All right, I'm off.
- Okay.

605
00:29:44,385 --> 00:29:45,791
- Be a gentleman.
Walk me to my car.

606
00:29:45,792 --> 00:29:47,148
- All right, all right.

607
00:29:47,149 --> 00:29:49,322
- Thanks for the shirts.
I'll gel them next time, okay?

608
00:29:49,323 --> 00:29:51,389
- Yeah, you'll be an the road,
and you'll be saying,

609
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,491
"Oh, maybe I'll call him up.“

610
00:29:59,962 --> 00:30:01,596
- Hey.
- Hey.

611
00:30:01,597 --> 00:30:03,508
- Sorry, I don't want
to hold you up or anything,

612
00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:05,633
but I, um-

613
00:30:05,634 --> 00:30:06,934
I made this for you.

614
00:30:06,935 --> 00:30:09,103
Burned it, whatever,

615
00:30:09,104 --> 00:30:11,339
Um, ifs music from the survey class

616
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,512
I was telling you about.

617
00:30:12,513 --> 00:30:15,009
- Oh.
- Classical, baroque, opera.

618
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:17,045
- WWI.

619
00:30:17,046 --> 00:30:18,479
This is great.

620
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,214
I know none of this.

621
00:30:20,215 --> 00:30:22,417
Who says we always have to be listening

622
00:30:22,418 --> 00:30:23,829
to obscure indie bands, right'?

623
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,353
- Right.

624
00:30:25,354 --> 00:30:27,588
So, um, yeah, I don't know.

625
00:30:27,589 --> 00:30:31,693
This is all music I never
thought I'd like or care about,

626
00:30:31,694 --> 00:30:33,695
and this class just-

627
00:30:33,696 --> 00:30:36,176
well, you know how you can be
told something so many limes

628
00:30:36,177 --> 00:30:38,132
and it's like, 'Whatever,"

629
00:30:38,133 --> 00:30:39,701
and then you have a great teacher

630
00:30:39,702 --> 00:30:40,976
take you through it,

631
00:30:40,977 --> 00:30:46,007
and suddenly it's like,
"Beethoven, whoa."

632
00:30:46,008 --> 00:30:47,975
- Yeah.

633
00:30:47,976 --> 00:30:49,477
Thin is really great Thank you.

634
00:30:49,478 --> 00:30:53,147
I wish I had come with something for you.

635
00:30:53,148 --> 00:30:56,517
- Well, you know what you could do?

636
00:30:56,518 --> 00:31:00,455
You could write me a letter.

637
00:31:00,456 --> 00:31:01,560
- I could do that.

638
00:31:01,561 --> 00:31:02,890
- Handwritten, I mean,

639
00:31:02,891 --> 00:31:04,268
like with a pen or something.

640
00:31:04,269 --> 00:31:06,828
- Ooh.
- Yeah, paper.

641
00:31:06,829 --> 00:31:09,063
Maybe seal it with some red wax.

642
00:31:09,064 --> 00:31:10,839
- I could listen to this while I'm writing.

643
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,468
- Right, it'll be like
full-on 17th century.

644
00:31:13,469 --> 00:31:15,670
- Right, right.

645
00:31:15,671 --> 00:31:18,106
So, um, I don't have your address.

646
00:31:18,107 --> 00:31:19,707
- Oh, 108 it my P.O. box.

647
00:31:19,708 --> 00:31:21,244
And you can figure out the rest, right?

648
00:31:21,245 --> 00:31:22,688
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

649
00:31:22,689 --> 00:31:27,181
- I also-l put my number
on the inside of the case.

650
00:31:27,182 --> 00:31:28,950
- Yes, you did.

651
00:31:28,951 --> 00:31:30,585
- You know, in can you ever-

652
00:31:30,586 --> 00:31:31,686
whatever.

653
00:31:31,687 --> 00:31:34,489
- Yeah, right.

654
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:35,656
Okay-

655
00:31:35,657 --> 00:31:39,293
- Well...
- Well...

656
00:31:39,294 --> 00:31:40,428
- Yeah.

657
00:31:40,429 --> 00:31:41,931
Bye.
- Bye.

658
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,108
- Professor Fairfield.

659
00:31:54,109 --> 00:31:57,044
Uh, Jesse Fisher.

660
00:31:57,045 --> 00:31:59,046
I, um-

661
00:31:59,047 --> 00:32:01,115
I took your British Romantic literature class

662
00:32:01,116 --> 00:32:04,419
when I was here as a student.

663
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:07,288
. And?

664
00:32:07,289 --> 00:32:12,466
- And I loved it.

665
00:32:19,001 --> 00:32:21,447
Great.

666
00:32:30,712 --> 00:32:33,158
Hey, Dean.

667
00:32:35,284 --> 00:32:36,984
- I know ifs bad for you.

668
00:32:36,985 --> 00:32:40,354
- Just quit when you graduate,
like everyone else.

669
00:32:40,355 --> 00:32:42,023
- Sweet ride.

670
00:32:42,024 --> 00:32:43,491
- You jerk

671
00:32:43,492 --> 00:32:45,159
It's a rental.

672
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:48,496
I'm not the best at flying.

673
00:32:48,497 --> 00:32:49,737
- I can understand that

674
00:32:49,738 --> 00:32:50,766
- Where you headed?

675
00:32:50,767 --> 00:32:51,972
- Back to my dorm.

676
00:32:51,973 --> 00:32:54,174
- Get in.
I'll give you a lift.

677
00:33:05,147 --> 00:33:06,948
- So you went here, right'?

678
00:33:06,949 --> 00:33:08,015
- I did.

679
00:33:08,016 --> 00:33:09,051
- You liked it'?

680
00:33:09,052 --> 00:33:10,685
- Am.

681
00:33:10,686 --> 00:33:12,854
I mean, you block out
the bad memories-

682
00:33:12,855 --> 00:33:15,823
writing a senior thesis, February.

683
00:33:15,824 --> 00:33:17,592
- Yeah, February here sucks.

684
00:33:17,593 --> 00:33:19,227
- Yeah, it's horrible.

685
00:33:19,228 --> 00:33:24,031
So other than February,
things are good for you here?

686
00:33:24,032 --> 00:33:27,301
- I wouldn't say that.

687
00:33:27,302 --> 00:33:31,876
- You want to-you can tell me
about it if you want.

688
00:33:34,142 --> 00:33:37,545
Well, um, ifs nut exactly a secret.

689
00:33:37,546 --> 00:33:44,051
Last year, I kind of, um lost my mind a bit.

690
00:33:44,052 --> 00:33:45,554
I don'! really remember
much of it,

691
00:33:45,555 --> 00:33:50,358
but apparently I got up to
some pretty amusing antics.

692
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:55,229
So now they've got me
on this pretty heavy stuff,

693
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:58,232
which I guess allows me to function

694
00:33:58,233 --> 00:34:01,736
but it also makes everything seem underwater,

695
00:34:01,737 --> 00:34:04,805
which is not an pleasant as it sounds.

696
00:34:04,806 --> 00:34:07,508
- Why'd you come back?

697
00:34:07,509 --> 00:34:10,811
a nurse.

698
00:34:10,812 --> 00:34:12,980
She raised me on her own.

699
00:34:12,981 --> 00:34:15,416
I got a full ride.

700
00:34:15,417 --> 00:34:18,986
She's...

701
00:34:18,987 --> 00:34:21,263
so proud I'm here.

702
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:30,000
Thanks for the lift.

703
00:35:43,005 --> 00:35:45,840
- 'Dear Zibby, I can't thank you enough

00:47:40,221 --> 00:47:42,556
I feel a little weird about being here.

897
00:47:42,557 --> 00:47:43,990
- Why?
Don't.

898
00:47:43,991 --> 00:47:45,902
- Well, I don't know if you know this,

899
00:47:45,903 --> 00:47:49,062
but, uh, I'm a few years older than you.

900
00:47:49,063 --> 00:47:50,530
- You are?

901
00:47:50,531 --> 00:47:52,065
- Just a few, yeah,

902
00:47:52,066 --> 00:47:53,800
and I'm not necessarily
saying-

903
00:47:53,801 --> 00:47:55,405
I don't want to get ahead of myself here.

904
00:47:55,406 --> 00:47:56,536
Ifs just-

905
00:47:56,537 --> 00:47:57,871
- Oh, Wail. 30"'!-

906
00:47:57,872 --> 00:48:01,911
You-did you think this was,
like, a romantic thing?

907
00:48:05,246 --> 00:48:06,657
Just kidding.

908
00:48:07,915 --> 00:48:09,282
- Oh, my--

909
00:48:09,283 --> 00:48:11,422
- Come here.

910
00:48:18,426 --> 00:48:21,828
Try not to overthink things, okay?

911
00:48:21,829 --> 00:48:23,274
- You're talking to the wrong guy.

912
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:26,566
- Well, look

913
00:48:26,567 --> 00:48:28,602
We connect really well,
don! you think?

914
00:48:28,603 --> 00:48:31,405
- We do, yeah.

915
00:48:31,406 --> 00:48:33,750
I just can't figure out
if ifs because you're advanced

916
00:48:33,751 --> 00:48:35,842
or because I'm stunted,

917
00:48:35,843 --> 00:48:38,311
- It's because I'm advanced.

918
00:48:38,312 --> 00:48:40,113
. Maybe.

919
00:48:40,114 --> 00:48:42,685
But I'm also a little stunted.

920
00:48:45,953 --> 00:48:48,855
- Look, I want lo like things slowly, okay?

921
00:48:48,856 --> 00:48:50,590
- Yeah, okay.

922
00:48:50,591 --> 00:48:53,126
Me too.
Me too.

923
00:48:53,127 --> 00:48:55,796
- But I would like to kiss you

924
00:48:55,797 --> 00:48:57,970
on your forehead.

925
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:01,007
Can I kiss you on your forehead?

926
00:49:02,437 --> 00:49:03,537
Say yes'

927
00:49:03,538 --> 00:49:05,245
- Yea.

928
00:49:12,413 --> 00:49:14,247
- And your chin'!

929
00:49:14,248 --> 00:49:15,659
May I kiss your chin?

930
00:49:34,001 --> 00:49:35,139
- Sorry.
Hi, sorry.

931
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:37,514
Just need to grab something.

932
00:49:44,011 --> 00:49:45,912
- Roommates.

933
00:49:45,913 --> 00:49:48,748
- Can we-are you hungry'!

934
00:49:48,749 --> 00:49:50,016
- I could eat.

935
00:49:50,017 --> 00:49:51,351
- Yeah?

936
00:49:51,352 --> 00:49:53,987
Maybe we could go into town and grab something?

937
00:49:53,988 --> 00:49:55,058
- That'll take too long.

938
00:49:55,059 --> 00:49:57,224
I have class at 2:00.

939
00:49:57,225 --> 00:49:58,592
- On.

940
00:49:58,593 --> 00:50:03,542
good and even closer.

941
00:50:34,795 --> 00:50:36,570
- Hey, Dean.

942
00:50:39,333 --> 00:50:41,201
- You get a job here?

943
00:50:41,202 --> 00:50:42,269
- I wish.

944
00:50:42,270 --> 00:50:44,271
Hey, I seem to have lost my friend.

945
00:50:44,272 --> 00:50:45,512
You mind if I...

946
00:50:50,011 --> 00:50:52,112
What are you working on?

947
00:50:52,113 --> 00:50:56,049
- Yeah, ifs this...

948
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:57,751
novel.

949
00:50:57,752 --> 00:50:59,085
- Good for you.

950
00:50:59,086 --> 00:51:00,186
- I fill!!!

951
00:51:00,187 --> 00:51:01,257
- You happy with if?

952
00:51:01,258 --> 00:51:02,427
- Not really.

953
00:51:06,427 --> 00:51:07,770
- Haw you been?
Any batter?

954
00:51:07,771 --> 00:51:10,263
- No.

955
00:51:10,264 --> 00:51:12,599
I kind of just wish this would all be over

956
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,079
as soon as possible.

957
00:51:17,238 --> 00:51:20,310
Why did you lave it here so much'!

958
00:51:24,612 --> 00:51:28,148
- It's the only time you get
to do this, you know?

959
00:51:28,149 --> 00:51:30,450
You get to sit around and read books all day,

960
00:51:30,451 --> 00:51:33,620
have really great conversations about idea;

961
00:51:33,621 --> 00:51:37,891
People out in the world,
they're not really doing that.

962
00:51:37,892 --> 00:51:39,259
Think about it.

963
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:41,433
You could go up to everyone here
and say, 'I'm a poet,"

964
00:51:41,434 --> 00:51:44,331
and no one will punch you in the face.

965
00:51:44,332 --> 00:51:46,800
I mean, that's something.

966
00:51:46,801 --> 00:51:48,401
- Yeah.

967
00:51:48,402 --> 00:51:51,805
I get that.

968
00:51:51,806 --> 00:51:54,240
I just can't get around the fact

969
00:51:54,241 --> 00:51:58,411
that I'm, like, aggressively unhappy here.

970
00:51:58,412 --> 00:52:00,046
- Jesse.

971
00:52:00,047 --> 00:52:01,993
Jesse!

972
00:52:10,891 --> 00:52:14,930
- That's my number, if you ever want to talk,

973
00:52:38,552 --> 00:52:40,088
. HEY-
. HO)'-

974
00:52:42,323 --> 00:52:44,324
- Please tell me this is Vanessa's.

975
00:52:44,325 --> 00:52:46,459
- Nope, that's mine.

976
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:47,700
- Wait, you actually read this'?

977
00:52:47,701 --> 00:52:48,828
- Yeah.

978
00:52:48,829 --> 00:52:50,130
- All of it?

979
00:52:50,131 --> 00:52:51,364
- YUP-

980
00:52:51,365 --> 00:52:54,100
- Unironically?

981
00:52:54,101 --> 00:52:57,203
- Very sincerely'

982
00:52:57,204 --> 00:52:59,844
- What is it with you girls and vampires?

983
00:53:01,375 --> 00:53:02,876
What's it about'?

984
00:53:02,877 --> 00:53:04,177
- Vampires.

985
00:53:04,178 --> 00:53:06,880
- No, what's it about?

986
00:53:06,881 --> 00:53:08,048
Vampires.

987
00:53:08,049 --> 00:53:10,050
- I don't understand.
Is it good?

988
00:53:10,051 --> 00:53:11,117
- No.

989
00:53:11,118 --> 00:53:13,386
I mean, yeah.
But no.

990
00:53:13,387 --> 00:53:14,388
- Well, then why read it'?

991
00:53:14,389 --> 00:53:15,722
- 'Cause I like it.

992
00:53:15,723 --> 00:53:18,358
- That's no reason to read something.

993
00:53:18,359 --> 00:53:20,694
- Why else would you read something?

994
00:53:20,695 --> 00:53:21,861
- Seriously.

995
00:53:21,862 --> 00:53:24,197
Many amazing books in the world.

996
00:53:24,198 --> 00:53:25,598
Why would you read this?

997
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:28,068
- Okay, I hate this conversation.

998
00:53:28,069 --> 00:53:29,569
Can we stop?

999
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:30,913
- Wait, this is a trilogy, right?

1000
00:53:30,914 --> 00:53:33,673
- I'm afraid to answer that.

1001
00:53:33,674 --> 00:53:35,508
- You've read three of these?

1002
00:53:35,509 --> 00:53:36,817
- Have you ever read one of them?

1003
00:53:36,818 --> 00:53:38,211
What do you think?

1004
00:53:38,212 --> 00:53:41,147
- How can you hate something
if you've never read it?

1005
00:53:41,148 --> 00:53:44,684
I mean, isn't that like
what repressive regimes do?

1006
00:53:44,685 --> 00:53:46,753
You want to bum books you don't like?

1007
00:53:46,754 --> 00:53:49,189
- You're right.
You know what l'm gonna do?

1008
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:51,101
Rm gonna read thin book, all of it

1009
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:53,159
And then we can discuss it.

1010
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,228
- Right now?
- Yeah, why not')

1011
00:53:55,229 --> 00:53:57,230
I mean, how long can it take, really?

1012
00:53:57,231 --> 00:54:00,303
This is great, a little book club.

1013
00:54:02,203 --> 00:54:03,703
- Seriously?

1014
00:54:03,704 --> 00:54:05,538
- YUP-

1015
00:54:05,539 --> 00:54:07,450
See ya soon.

1016
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:45,779
Oh, no, this isn't what it-

1017
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:47,647
I'm reading it as a dare.

1018
00:54:47,648 --> 00:54:50,492
It's a bet, actually.

1019
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:55,121
I loved your class!

1020
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:27,187
- Should I start'?

1021
00:55:27,188 --> 00:55:29,022
- Please.

1022
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:31,124
- OK!!-

1023
00:55:31,125 --> 00:55:33,493
I liked it.

1024
00:55:33,494 --> 00:55:35,862
It was fun and stupid.
- Mm-hmm

1025
00:55:35,863 --> 00:55:37,497
- And it passed the time.

1026
00:55:37,498 --> 00:55:40,834
And it's not Tolstoy,
but it's also not television.

1027
00:55:40,835 --> 00:55:43,970
And it made me happy.

1028
00:55:43,971 --> 00:55:46,042
Now you.

1029
00:55:47,541 --> 00:55:50,385
- Thank you.
- Mm.

1030
00:55:52,112 --> 00:55:54,180
- This...

1031
00:55:54,181 --> 00:55:56,382
is the worst book

1032
00:55:56,383 --> 00:55:59,152
ever written

1033
00:55:59,153 --> 00:56:01,421
in English.

1034
00:56:01,422 --> 00:56:05,992
- So there are worse books
written in other languages?

1035
00:56:05,993 --> 00:56:07,660
- Probably not

1036
00:56:07,661 --> 00:56:10,230
unless this book is translated
into other languages.

1037
00:56:10,231 --> 00:56:11,898
- Okay, we really-

1038
00:56:11,899 --> 00:56:13,037
we don't need to do this.

1039
00:56:13,038 --> 00:56:14,601
- No, please, let's.

1040
00:56:14,602 --> 00:56:17,770
I need to know
haw you read these-

1041
00:56:17,771 --> 00:56:20,440
whew, l guess
you call them sentences-

1042
00:56:20,441 --> 00:56:22,742
close the book, and feel anything

1043
00:56:22,743 --> 00:56:23,881
other than offended and sad?

1044
00:56:23,882 --> 00:56:25,255
- Well, millions of people like it.

1045
00:56:25,256 --> 00:56:27,055
- So when millions of people like something,

1046
00:56:27,056 --> 00:56:28,219
that means it's good?

1047
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:29,853
- No, it means millions of people like it

1048
00:56:29,854 --> 00:56:33,152
These books make people happy.

1049
00:56:33,153 --> 00:56:35,463
We don't always have to be
thinking about poli-sci

1050
00:56:35,464 --> 00:56:37,757
or reading Chaucer, which, by the way, I hated.

1051
00:56:37,758 --> 00:56:39,626
- You're not supposed to like it.

1052
00:56:39,627 --> 00:56:41,231
- But then why read if?

1053
00:56:42,363 --> 00:56:43,764
You love college so much, right?

1054
00:56:43,764 --> 00:56:46,200
Isn't it all about understanding
different points of view'?

1055
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:47,941
- It's also about developing taste.

1056
00:56:47,942 --> 00:56:49,769
- That was snobby.
You're a snob.

1057
00:56:49,770 --> 00:56:50,937
- No, I'm not

1058
00:56:50,938 --> 00:56:52,110
- Yea, you are.

1059
00:56:52,111 --> 00:56:53,608
You think it's cool to hale things.

1060
00:56:53,609 --> 00:56:55,441
And it's not.
It's boring.

1061
00:56:55,442 --> 00:56:56,716
Talk about what you love,

1062
00:56:56,717 --> 00:56:58,621
and keep quiet about what you don't

1063
00:56:58,622 --> 00:57:00,747
- Look, I know how this sounds, but trust me.

1064
00:57:00,748 --> 00:57:02,448
This is a big deal, okay'?

1065
00:57:02,449 --> 00:57:03,928
This country is in bad shape,

1066
00:57:03,929 --> 00:57:06,486
and it has to do, in large part, I think,

1067
00:57:06,487 --> 00:57:09,555
with people liking things
that are very, very bad.

1068
00:57:09,556 --> 00:57:11,391
- But according to you,

1069
00:57:11,392 --> 00:57:13,770
Why are you the one who gets
to decide what's good and bad?

1070
00:57:13,771 --> 00:57:15,468
And do you only want to surround yourself

1071
00:57:15,469 --> 00:57:17,408
with people who've read the same books as you?

1072
00:57:17,409 --> 00:57:20,641
- I guess we're gonna have to
move on to a specific example-

1073
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:24,837
- Where are you?

1074
00:57:24,838 --> 00:57:26,139
- What do you mean?

1075
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:28,141
- I mean, you are somewhere,

1076
00:57:28,142 --> 00:57:29,475
but it's not here.

1077
00:57:29,476 --> 00:57:32,211
- No, I'm-l'm here.

1078
00:57:32,212 --> 00:57:34,480
- So why are we spending all our time

1079
00:57:34,481 --> 00:57:37,052
having a stupid argument about a book?

1080
00:57:49,964 --> 00:57:50,997
- Hey, Peter.

1081
00:57:50,998 --> 00:57:52,841
- Zibby

1082
00:58:05,012 --> 00:58:06,546
- Peter.

1083
00:58:06,547 --> 00:58:07,685
Peter.

1084
00:58:09,183 --> 00:58:11,254
- What the hell are you doing here?

1085
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,027
I don't know'

1086
00:58:20,894 --> 00:58:23,663
- You know how old I am?

1087
00:58:23,664 --> 00:58:24,998
- No, how old are you?

1088
00:58:24,999 --> 00:58:27,033
none of your goddamn business.

1089
00:58:27,034 --> 00:58:31,170
Do you know how old I feel like I am?

1090
00:58:31,171 --> 00:58:33,873
19.

1091
00:58:33,874 --> 00:58:38,211
Since I was 19, I have never felt not 19.

1092
00:58:38,212 --> 00:58:42,048
But I shave my face, and I look in the mirror,

1093
00:58:42,049 --> 00:58:43,383
and I'm forced to say,

1094
00:58:43,384 --> 00:58:46,558
"This is not a 19-year-old
staring back at me, “

1095
00:58:48,989 --> 00:58:51,924
Teaching here all these years,

1096
00:58:51,925 --> 00:58:55,228
I've had to be very clear with myself

1097
00:58:55,229 --> 00:58:57,530
that even though I'm surrounded
by 19-year-old:

1098
00:58:57,531 --> 00:59:00,066
and I may have felt 19,

1099
00:59:00,067 --> 00:59:02,368
I'm not 19 anymore.

1100
00:59:02,369 --> 00:59:04,315
You follow me?

1101
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:07,778
- Yeah.

1102
00:59:09,009 --> 00:59:13,146
- Nobody feels like an adult.

1103
00:59:13,147 --> 00:59:15,491
It's the world's dirty secret.

1104
00:59:27,428 --> 00:59:30,930
- How perfect is the universe?

1105
00:59:30,931 --> 00:59:33,366
- You're still here?

1106
00:59:33,367 --> 00:59:35,201
- Lucky for you,

1107
00:59:35,202 --> 00:59:38,945
'cause you look like you could use a friend.

1108
00:59:43,444 --> 00:59:46,179
Did you know there's so many
preservatives in the food we eat

1109
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:47,887
that they're finding it's taking longer

1110
00:59:47,888 --> 00:59:51,984
for our bodies to decompose once we die?

1111
00:59:51,985 --> 00:59:53,286
- No way.
Really?

1112
00:59:53,287 --> 00:59:56,461
- Preservatives, man.
messed up.

1113
00:59:59,827 --> 01:00:01,294
Want some good news?

1114
01:00:01,295 --> 01:00:03,796
- Please.

1115
01:00:03,797 --> 01:00:06,933
- Caterpillars-
give me my hat.

1116
01:00:06,934 --> 01:00:09,735
They're just scouting along, right,

1117
01:00:09,736 --> 01:00:11,671
being caterpillars.

1118
01:00:11,672 --> 01:00:14,774
At some point, these cells
show up called imaginal cells.

1119
01:00:14,775 --> 01:00:16,482
Scientists don't know where they come from

1120
01:00:16,483 --> 01:00:17,810
or why they appear,

1121
01:00:17,811 --> 01:00:21,214
but these imaginal cells show up
inside the caterpillar

1122
01:00:21,215 --> 01:00:23,161
and say, 'Get psyched, caterpillar!

1123
01:00:23,162 --> 01:00:25,651
It's butterfly-turning-into
time."

1124
01:00:25,652 --> 01:00:26,986
- Mm-hmm.

1125
01:00:26,987 --> 01:00:28,967
- And whit do all the other caterpillar calla do

1126
01:00:28,968 --> 01:00:30,957
when these imaginal cells show up?

1127
01:00:30,958 --> 01:00:32,558
- I have no idea.

1128
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:33,663
- They attack 'em!

1129
01:00:33,664 --> 01:00:35,328
Try to kill 'em!

1130
01:00:35,329 --> 01:00:38,331
They're like, 'Screw you, imaginal cells.

1131
01:00:38,332 --> 01:00:40,133
'We're happy being a caterpillar.

1132
01:00:40,134 --> 01:00:41,868
Gel lost!“

1133
01:00:41,869 --> 01:00:45,972
Bu! eventually,
the imaginal cells keep growling

1134
01:00:45,973 --> 01:00:48,841
and overtake the destiny of the caterpillar

1135
01:00:48,842 --> 01:00:51,177
and will it into this cocoon.

1136
01:00:51,178 --> 01:00:53,045
And then guess what happens next.

1137
01:00:53,046 --> 01:00:56,015
into a butterfly.

1138
01:00:56,016 --> 01:00:59,018
- The caterpillar turns into a butterfly.

1139
01:00:59,019 --> 01:01:00,191
- That's awesome.

1140
01:01:00,192 --> 01:01:01,521
- I know it is!

1141
01:01:01,522 --> 01:01:03,256
- Yeah, that's good.

1142
01:01:03,257 --> 01:01:07,727
- And that is why there is
no reason to be afraid,

1143
01:01:07,728 --> 01:01:11,731
because everything is okay.

1144
01:01:11,732 --> 01:01:15,668
- Yeah, I don't know if I believe that.

1145
01:01:15,669 --> 01:01:19,972
- It has to be true.

1146
01:01:19,973 --> 01:01:22,715
There can be no other way.

1147
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:29,015
- You know, I'm not even sure if you're real.

1148
01:01:29,016 --> 01:01:30,816
I mean, seriously.

1149
01:01:30,817 --> 01:01:33,819
- Ifs all true, brother.

1150
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:35,390
Whatever you believe.

1151
01:01:37,324 --> 01:01:38,564
- What is that?

1152
01:01:38,565 --> 01:01:39,629
What are you drinking?

1153
01:01:39,630 --> 01:01:42,094
- H to the 2 to the O.

1154
01:01:42,095 --> 01:01:43,663
You should have some.

1155
01:01:43,664 --> 01:01:45,905
Got to stay hydrated.

1156
01:01:47,534 --> 01:01:49,309
- All right.

1157
01:01:57,177 --> 01:02:00,215
Oh, thanks.

1158
01:02:12,192 --> 01:02:14,433
Ooh!

1159
01:02:17,130 --> 01:02:19,406
You with me, bro?

1160
01:02:21,034 --> 01:02:24,503
Yeah.

1161
01:02:24,504 --> 01:02:28,574
I like you, Nat'

1162
01:02:28,575 --> 01:02:31,811
Thanks for being my friend.

1163
01:02:31,812 --> 01:02:34,113
- Easiest thing in the world.

1164
01:02:34,114 --> 01:02:37,450
- I enjoyed this.

1165
01:02:37,451 --> 01:02:39,453
I'm off.

1166
01:02:42,556 --> 01:02:44,126
- You go get her, man.

1167
01:02:45,726 --> 01:02:47,728
- Huh

1168
01:02:49,396 --> 01:02:51,376
Okay-

1169
01:02:54,001 --> 01:02:58,137
- Be love, man.

1170
01:02:58,138 --> 01:02:59,617
Be love!

1171
01:03:11,285 --> 01:03:13,019
You seem happy.

1172
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:15,154
- I am.

1173
01:03:15,155 --> 01:03:17,490
- What happened?

1174
01:03:17,491 --> 01:03:19,592
- I don't know.

1175
01:03:19,593 --> 01:03:21,961
Something.

1176
01:03:21,962 --> 01:03:24,096
- Can I tell you some things?

1177
01:03:24,097 --> 01:03:25,431
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

1178
01:03:25,432 --> 01:03:29,435
- Okay, well, except for the book thing,

1179
01:03:29,436 --> 01:03:33,272
which was genuinely super annoying,

1180
01:03:33,273 --> 01:03:38,844
I-I feel really good about you.

1181
01:03:38,845 --> 01:03:44,684
It's been a while since I fell
that way about someone.

1182
01:03:44,685 --> 01:03:48,321
And I like it.

1183
01:03:48,322 --> 01:03:50,790
- Yeah, me too.

1184
01:03:50,791 --> 01:03:54,068
- I want you lo slay here with me tonight

1185
01:03:55,796 --> 01:03:58,030
- You have a roommate,

1186
01:03:58,031 --> 01:04:01,535
- She's sleeping elsewhere.

1187
01:04:03,036 --> 01:04:04,970
- Ah.

1188
01:04:04,971 --> 01:04:06,450
- So will you stay here?

1189
01:04:09,176 --> 01:04:10,876
- Yea.

1190
01:04:10,877 --> 01:04:13,612
- Good.

1191
01:04:13,613 --> 01:04:15,381
But I have in tell you something.

1192
01:04:15,382 --> 01:04:19,719
Um...

1193
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:23,723
this-it would be my, um...

1194
01:04:23,724 --> 01:04:26,398
first time.

1195
01:04:29,629 --> 01:04:32,565
But I want to.

1196
01:04:32,566 --> 01:04:34,876
With you.

1197
01:04:37,404 --> 01:04:41,173
- Okay, um...

1198
01:04:41,174 --> 01:04:42,942
I have to-

1199
01:04:42,943 --> 01:04:44,243
hold on.

1200
01:04:44,244 --> 01:04:46,946
I'll-l'll be back
in a second, okay'?

1201
01:04:46,947 --> 01:04:48,949
- OK!!-

1202
01:05:16,743 --> 01:05:18,154
- I should never have told you that

1203
01:05:18,155 --> 01:05:19,745
good.

1204
01:05:19,746 --> 01:05:24,550
I'm-l'm glad you did.

1205
01:05:24,551 --> 01:05:26,919
- So is that a problem?

1206
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:30,389
- Well, yeah, it is.

1207
01:05:30,390 --> 01:05:32,461
- WM?

1208
01:05:33,693 --> 01:05:36,695
Okay, well, first of all, I'm 35.

1209
01:05:36,696 --> 01:05:38,597
- You don'! look it
- Thank you.

1210
01:05:38,598 --> 01:05:39,804
- Plus, it doesn't bother me.

1211
01:05:39,805 --> 01:05:41,133
- Well, it bothers me.

1212
01:05:41,134 --> 01:05:42,306
- Well, it shouldn't.

1213
01:05:42,307 --> 01:05:45,404
Age is a stupid thing to obsess over.

1214
01:05:45,405 --> 01:05:47,873
What if reincarnation is real, huh?

1215
01:05:47,874 --> 01:05:49,341
Think about that.

1216
01:05:49,342 --> 01:05:52,812
What if I'm, like, thousands
of years older than you?

1217
01:05:52,813 --> 01:05:55,481
- Okay, that's not really a sound argument.

1218
01:05:55,482 --> 01:05:56,816
- Why not')

1219
01:05:56,817 --> 01:05:58,617
- Because ifs like saying,

1220
01:05:58,618 --> 01:06:01,353
'What if reality is all
an illusion?"

1221
01:06:01,354 --> 01:06:03,355
Then there are no consequences to anything.

1222
01:06:03,356 --> 01:06:05,257
We're completely off the hook,

1223
01:06:05,258 --> 01:06:08,360
And I believe in consequences.

1224
01:06:08,361 --> 01:06:10,496
- No, you believe in guilt.

1225
01:06:10,497 --> 01:06:12,832
- Maybe.

1226
01:06:12,833 --> 01:06:18,283
But guilt before we act is called morality.

1227
01:06:23,443 --> 01:06:25,678
Why did you come back here?

1228
01:06:25,679 --> 01:06:28,013
- To see you,
but I didn't know that you-

1229
01:06:28,014 --> 01:06:29,357
- Why should that matter'!

1230
01:06:29,358 --> 01:06:31,951
I mean, inn'! it,
I don't know, flattering?

1231
01:06:31,952 --> 01:06:34,053
- Listen.

1232
01:06:34,054 --> 01:06:35,863
Elizabeth.

1233
01:06:37,858 --> 01:06:41,527
Sex is really complicated, okay?

1234
01:06:41,528 --> 01:06:44,864
I didn't quite understand that
when I was younger,

1235
01:06:44,865 --> 01:06:46,332
but I do now.

1236
01:06:46,333 --> 01:06:48,609
- Okay, look, I didn't sign
one of those contracts

1237
01:06:48,610 --> 01:06:50,469
when I was in high school, okay?

1238
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:53,305
I'm not a prude or whatever.

1239
01:06:53,306 --> 01:06:57,710
just, I never met anyone that I trusted

1240
01:06:57,711 --> 01:07:02,081
or even liked enough

1241
01:07:02,082 --> 01:07:04,084
until now.

1242
01:07:07,354 --> 01:07:09,231
- I can't.

1243
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:17,396
- Are you not attracted to me?

1244
01:07:17,397 --> 01:07:19,632
- Na.
I mean, yea, I am.

1245
01:07:19,633 --> 01:07:22,067
It's just.

1246
01:07:22,068 --> 01:07:28,340
I also care about you a lat already, somehow.

1247
01:07:28,341 --> 01:07:31,911
- So, um, essentially,

1248
01:07:31,912 --> 01:07:33,255
you don't want to sleep with me

1249
01:07:33,256 --> 01:07:37,388
because you like and respect me too much.

1250
01:07:40,186 --> 01:07:42,388
- Basically.

1251
01:07:42,389 --> 01:07:44,857
Yeah.

1252
01:07:44,858 --> 01:07:47,259
- That's, like, the saddest thing over.

1253
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:48,705
- Look, I want to be in your life.

1254
01:07:48,706 --> 01:07:49,895
I do.

1255
01:07:49,896 --> 01:07:52,698
- Yeah, I already have an older brother, okay'?

1256
01:07:52,699 --> 01:07:54,679
And I don't need some mentor.

1257
01:07:59,105 --> 01:08:02,450
- I can'! just say yes
to everything.

1258
01:08:05,211 --> 01:08:07,413
Elizabeth.

1259
01:08:07,414 --> 01:08:09,315
- Slop calling me that.

1260
01:08:09,316 --> 01:08:10,416
- What?

1261
01:08:10,417 --> 01:08:11,623
- No one calls me that

1262
01:08:11,624 --> 01:08:13,097
You need to leave right now.

1263
01:08:13,098 --> 01:08:15,321
I'm really upset, and you need to go.

1264
01:08:15,322 --> 01:08:17,302
- OK!!-

1265
01:08:20,894 --> 01:08:23,101
- Get out!

1266
01:08:32,806 --> 01:08:37,050
# <i>I've got a right to lose my mind</i> #

1267
01:08:40,513 --> 01:08:41,580
# <i>Since...</i> #

1268
01:08:41,581 --> 01:08:43,749
- Well, well, well.

1269
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:47,453
# <i>Since you left me here</i> #

1270
01:08:47,454 --> 01:08:50,756
- Now I remember you.

1271
01:08:50,757 --> 01:08:53,425
- You do?

1272
01:08:53,426 --> 01:08:55,337
- Not really.

1273
01:08:56,630 --> 01:09:00,499
# <i>I stumbled!</i> #

1274
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:02,067
# <i>On a new world</i> #

1275
01:09:02,068 --> 01:09:04,436
- Rough day?

1276
01:09:04,437 --> 01:09:06,178
- Yeah.

1277
01:09:09,175 --> 01:09:12,111
- "Mock on.
Mock on.

1278
01:09:12,112 --> 01:09:15,080
"'Tis all in vain.

1279
01:09:15,081 --> 01:09:17,750
"You throw the sand against the wind,

1280
01:09:17,751 --> 01:09:22,121
and the wind
blows it back again."

1281
01:09:22,122 --> 01:09:25,357
- Blake.

1282
01:09:25,358 --> 01:09:26,701
. A-plus.

1283
01:09:28,361 --> 01:09:32,398
- # <i>And the life</i> #

1284
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:33,639
# <i>And the life I'm living</i> #

1285
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:34,941
- French fries.

1286
01:09:37,470 --> 01:09:41,006
I wan jun about in order a basket.

1287
01:09:41,007 --> 01:09:42,875
# <i>To lose my mind</i> #

1288
01:09:42,876 --> 01:09:46,346
# <i>I've got a right to lose my mind</i> #

1289
01:09:54,954 --> 01:09:56,433
. HO)'-

1290
01:09:57,590 --> 01:09:59,491
Can you get me a beer'?

1291
01:09:59,492 --> 01:10:00,869
- Yeah, have mine.

1292
01:10:02,228 --> 01:10:04,530
- Of course, I'm thrilled.

1293
01:10:04,531 --> 01:10:06,432
Newly minted PhD.

1294
01:10:06,433 --> 01:10:08,000
I'm feeling very fancy

1295
01:10:08,001 --> 01:10:11,670
and officially teaching Ode on a Grecian Um

1296
01:10:11,671 --> 01:10:13,038
for the first time.

1297
01:10:13,039 --> 01:10:14,373
It's like heaven, right?

1298
01:10:14,374 --> 01:10:15,614
- - Right.
Right. right. right.

1299
01:10:15,615 --> 01:10:17,451
- And I decide to be a little dramatic.

1300
01:10:17,452 --> 01:10:18,718
I'm really gonna go for it

1301
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:20,385
and just recite the whole thing out loud.

1302
01:10:20,386 --> 01:10:21,415
What the hell, right'?

1303
01:10:21,416 --> 01:10:22,848
- Sure.

1304
01:10:22,849 --> 01:10:26,985
- And it's going very well,
if I do say so myself.

1305
01:10:26,986 --> 01:10:30,622
And as I reach the immortal final lines

1306
01:10:30,623 --> 01:10:34,093
of one of the great poems
ever written in English,

1307
01:10:34,094 --> 01:10:37,563
I hear myself say the following:

1308
01:10:37,564 --> 01:10:41,376
"Beauth is trudy, trudy beauth."

1309
01:10:42,736 --> 01:10:44,773
- "That is all ye know on Earth
and all ye need know."

1310
01:10:44,774 --> 01:10:46,472
- That is great

1311
01:10:46,473 --> 01:10:48,774
Great story.

1312
01:10:48,775 --> 01:10:50,652
When did you fall for the Romantics?

1313
01:10:50,653 --> 01:10:52,177
Was it, like-
I'm just curious,

1314
01:10:52,178 --> 01:10:54,480
but was it in college or grad school?

1315
01:10:54,481 --> 01:10:56,461
'Cause I knew almost nothing about those guys

1316
01:10:56,462 --> 01:10:58,283
before your class.

1317
01:10:58,284 --> 01:10:59,618
Your class.

1318
01:10:59,619 --> 01:11:01,720
Och, I can gush, right'?

1319
01:11:01,721 --> 01:11:03,322
I mean, I still think about it.

1320
01:11:03,323 --> 01:11:04,768
Ifs just-

1321
01:11:07,026 --> 01:11:09,228
What?

1322
01:11:09,229 --> 01:11:11,800
- You're very enthusiastic.

1323
01:11:13,299 --> 01:11:15,336
- I guess.

1324
01:11:27,313 --> 01:11:28,986
- I have a car.

1325
01:11:32,318 --> 01:11:33,585
- ORGY-

1326
01:11:33,586 --> 01:11:40,793
- I would like for you to get in it with me,

1327
01:11:40,794 --> 01:11:44,936
and I would like to drive us somewhere.

1328
01:11:47,333 --> 01:11:49,836
- Where?

1329
01:11:57,510 --> 01:11:59,378
- Don't worry about the fries,

1330
01:11:59,379 --> 01:12:01,825
They know me here.

1331
01:12:08,087 --> 01:12:09,688
up?

1332
01:12:09,689 --> 01:12:11,256
- Oh, hey, man.

1333
01:12:33,213 --> 01:12:35,147
Okay, you got to go.

1334
01:12:35,148 --> 01:12:36,982
- What?

1335
01:12:36,983 --> 01:12:39,318
- Out.
Go, now.

1336
01:12:39,319 --> 01:12:41,386
- Owl Are you serious?

1337
01:12:41,387 --> 01:12:42,955
- YUP-

1338
01:12:42,956 --> 01:12:47,192
- Yeah, I don't have to, uh,
stay the night or anything,

1339
01:12:47,193 --> 01:12:49,561
but could I-could I at least
catch my breath?

1340
01:12:49,562 --> 01:12:52,064
- Sure.

1341
01:12:52,065 --> 01:12:54,739
How long do you think that'll be?

1342
01:12:57,403 --> 01:12:58,677
- What?
- No, no.

1343
01:12:58,678 --> 01:13:01,173
It's just funny to me all of a sudden.

1344
01:13:01,174 --> 01:13:04,209
- What about it is amusing to you'?

1345
01:13:04,210 --> 01:13:08,580
- Your post-coital cigarette,
for one, is amusing to me.

1346
01:13:08,581 --> 01:13:10,182
- What, you never smoked?

1347
01:13:10,183 --> 01:13:12,184
- No, I did.
- But you quit

1348
01:13:12,185 --> 01:13:13,562
- Yeah.
- Pussy.

1349
01:13:15,321 --> 01:13:17,062
- Okay, you are the same Judith Fairfield

1350
01:13:17,063 --> 01:13:18,933
I took British Romantic literature from?

1351
01:13:18,934 --> 01:13:21,337
- "From whom I took
British Romantic literature,"

1352
01:13:21,338 --> 01:13:23,028
and yes, that's me.

1353
01:13:23,029 --> 01:13:25,441
But just because we screwed,
don't assume we're suddenly-

1354
01:13:25,442 --> 01:13:27,766
what is it you kids say nowadays?

1355
01:13:27,767 --> 01:13:29,167
BFFs?

1356
01:13:29,168 --> 01:13:30,442
- Yeah, that's not really-

1357
01:13:30,443 --> 01:13:32,372
- I mean, what do we really know
about each other?

1358
01:13:32,372 --> 01:13:34,045
You're a nonsmoker.
Congratulations.

1359
01:13:34,046 --> 01:13:35,713
You're going to live to be a hundred.

1360
01:13:35,714 --> 01:13:37,776
But what does it matter if your life is joyless?

1361
01:13:37,777 --> 01:13:40,379
And it will be.
Trust me.

1362
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:41,947
- What's happening here?

1363
01:13:41,948 --> 01:13:44,019
- You're gelling your clothes
and you're leaving,

1364
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:45,951
and I'm going to take an Ambien.

1365
01:13:45,952 --> 01:13:47,056
- No, I meant, what is hap-

1366
01:13:47,057 --> 01:13:48,293
- I mean, seriously.

1367
01:13:48,294 --> 01:13:50,029
You weren't thinking we were gonna cuddle

1368
01:13:50,030 --> 01:13:52,891
the rest of the night as I read you Wordsworth?

1369
01:13:52,892 --> 01:13:54,893
- Not anymore.

1370
01:13:54,894 --> 01:13:56,628
- Good.

1371
01:13:56,629 --> 01:13:58,764
I've taught at this school for over 20 years.

1372
01:13:58,765 --> 01:14:02,034
I've seen the emergence of
your kind like an infection-

1373
01:14:02,035 --> 01:14:05,137
all these effete,
overarticulate man-boys

1374
01:14:05,138 --> 01:14:06,939
who never learned to toughen up.

1375
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:08,473
Don't be one of them,

1376
01:14:08,474 --> 01:14:09,612
Go work with your hands.

1377
01:14:09,613 --> 01:14:10,644
Build something.

1378
01:14:10,645 --> 01:14:12,477
Punch someone in the face.

1379
01:14:12,478 --> 01:14:13,979
- WWI.

1380
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:15,254
Too bad Norman Mailer's dead.

1381
01:14:15,255 --> 01:14:17,159
would have been perfect for each other.

1382
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:18,322
- Shall I count to ten?

1383
01:14:18,323 --> 01:14:19,319
- Wail, just, can-

1384
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:21,925
hold on just one second, okay?

1385
01:14:26,225 --> 01:14:28,102
You don't seem very happy.

1386
01:14:30,129 --> 01:14:32,497
Your powers of deduction are stunning.

1387
01:14:32,498 --> 01:14:34,933
You must have gone to a very good college.

1388
01:14:34,934 --> 01:14:37,302
- I'm just confused how-

1389
01:14:37,303 --> 01:14:38,941
I mean, you're a tenured professor

1390
01:14:38,942 --> 01:14:41,673
in one of the most prestigious
English departments

1391
01:14:41,674 --> 01:14:42,709
in the country.

1392
01:14:42,710 --> 01:14:44,543
That's not fulfilling?

1393
01:14:44,544 --> 01:14:46,854
- Sit through a faculty meeting
at a liberal arts college,

1394
01:14:46,855 --> 01:14:48,313
Mr. Young Person.

1395
01:14:48,314 --> 01:14:50,658
I assure you, you will lose
all faith in humanity.

1396
01:14:50,659 --> 01:14:52,884
- Okay, but what about the classroom?

1397
01:14:52,885 --> 01:14:54,728
There had lo have been some joy there

1398
01:14:54,729 --> 01:14:57,122
I mean, you were such a good teacher.

1399
01:14:57,123 --> 01:14:59,191
- Thank you.

1400
01:14:59,192 --> 01:15:01,159
I like to teach.

1401
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:02,828
I used to love it.

1402
01:15:02,829 --> 01:15:04,363
- What happened?

1403
01:15:04,364 --> 01:15:08,300
- Life happened.

1404
01:15:08,301 --> 01:15:10,669
- Okay, I'm gonna need a little bit more'

1405
01:15:10,670 --> 01:15:12,274
- Well, that's all you're gonna get.

1406
01:15:12,275 --> 01:15:15,374
Unlike you, I'm not from the 'let me tell you

1407
01:15:15,375 --> 01:15:18,110
every sick, sordid detail
of my life" generation.

1408
01:15:18,111 --> 01:15:19,711
I value discretion.

1409
01:15:19,712 --> 01:15:21,747
I loathe self-pity.

1410
01:15:21,748 --> 01:15:23,682
So let's just leave it at this:

1411
01:15:23,683 --> 01:15:27,652
people are disappointing.

1412
01:15:27,653 --> 01:15:29,388
- Yeah, it's just,
I would think-

1413
01:15:29,389 --> 01:15:30,922
- Don't get comfortable.
- Sorry.

1414
01:15:30,923 --> 01:15:32,163
I would just think

1415
01:15:32,164 --> 01:15:34,559
that spending so much time with those poems

1416
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:38,230
would make you more, you know,
optimistic and hopeful.

1417
01:15:38,231 --> 01:15:39,598
- Nonsense.

1418
01:15:39,599 --> 01:15:40,932
They were miserable men

1419
01:15:40,933 --> 01:15:42,902
who were granted a few moments of transcendence,

1420
01:15:42,902 --> 01:15:44,404
and they had the talent and foresight

1421
01:15:44,405 --> 01:15:46,571
to grab pen and paper and write it down.

1422
01:15:46,572 --> 01:15:48,740
Byron was probably the happiest of the lot,

1423
01:15:48,741 --> 01:15:51,910
only because he put his dick in everything.

1424
01:15:51,911 --> 01:15:54,780
- This is the saddest evening of my life

1425
01:15:54,781 --> 01:15:56,081
- Get used to it.

1426
01:15:56,082 --> 01:15:59,718
My advice to you is this:

1427
01:15:59,719 --> 01:16:03,963
put some armor around that gooey
little heart of yours.

1428
01:16:09,595 --> 01:16:14,533
- Well, at least I appreciate the irony.

1429
01:16:14,534 --> 01:16:16,802
I just had the least romantic night of my life

1430
01:16:16,803 --> 01:16:18,578
with a Romantics professor.

1431
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:37,456
For what it's worth,

1432
01:16:37,457 --> 01:16:40,625
I meant everything I said about your class.

1433
01:16:40,626 --> 01:16:45,797
It opened something in me,

1434
01:16:45,798 --> 01:16:48,800
and I'm grateful for it.

1435
01:16:48,801 --> 01:16:51,903
And if my heart is gooey,

1436
01:16:51,904 --> 01:16:55,818
you're at least partially responsible for that.

1437
01:17:16,329 --> 01:17:18,930
- So you're still uninspired by admissions.

1438
01:17:18,931 --> 01:17:20,799
- Yeah, pretty much.

1439
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:23,135
- No little Jesse Fishers out there?

1440
01:17:23,136 --> 01:17:25,704
- Well, if there are, I'm not meeting them,

1441
01:17:25,705 --> 01:17:29,674
- Well, maybe you're just not recognizing them.

1442
01:17:29,675 --> 01:17:31,810
Anyway,

1443
01:17:31,811 --> 01:17:34,279
I do appreciate you coming by.

1444
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:35,680
I really do.

1445
01:17:35,681 --> 01:17:37,160
It's great to see you one last time

1446
01:17:37,161 --> 01:17:39,951
before I get the hell out of here.

1447
01:17:39,952 --> 01:17:42,354
- You feeling any better about things?

1448
01:17:42,355 --> 01:17:44,456
- Well,

1449
01:17:44,457 --> 01:17:46,491
I tried to turn the clock back.

1450
01:17:46,492 --> 01:17:49,861
it doesn't work.

1451
01:17:49,862 --> 01:17:52,697
- No, it doesn't.

1452
01:17:52,698 --> 01:17:55,901
- Now I just-

1453
01:17:55,902 --> 01:17:59,315
I keep waiting to feel more resolve somehow.

1454
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:02,876
What if I'm like one of those prisoners

1455
01:18:02,877 --> 01:18:04,376
that gets paroled

1456
01:18:04,377 --> 01:18:06,220
and finds he can't handle life on the outside

1457
01:18:06,221 --> 01:18:07,879
so he commits a petty crime

1458
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:12,918
so he can go back to what he knows?

1459
01:18:12,919 --> 01:18:15,729
- You think this place is a prison?

1460
01:18:18,324 --> 01:18:20,668
- Well, any place you don't leave is a prison.

1461
01:18:25,231 --> 01:18:28,567
Well, whatever.

1462
01:18:28,568 --> 01:18:32,737
OKAY-
- OK!!-

1463
01:18:32,738 --> 01:18:36,541
Hey.

1464
01:18:36,542 --> 01:18:39,022
You know why you're my second
favorite professor of all time?

1465
01:18:39,023 --> 01:18:40,579
- I have no idea.

1466
01:18:40,580 --> 01:18:43,925
by authors you hated.

1467
01:18:46,552 --> 01:18:49,931
Feel good about what you did here.

1468
01:18:52,525 --> 01:18:54,971
- Thank you.

1469
01:19:02,201 --> 01:19:05,614
Gel in your car now, and leave me be.

1470
01:19:23,222 --> 01:19:26,358
- "Dear Zibby, oven alter all these months,

1471
01:19:26,359 --> 01:19:28,305
"I'm still half-expecting
a letter from you

1472
01:19:28,306 --> 01:19:30,729
"to be sitting in my mailbox.

1473
01:19:30,730 --> 01:19:33,142
"I'm sure you have little left
to say to me at this point,

1474
01:19:33,143 --> 01:19:36,101
'bu! your letters
are very much missed.

1475
01:19:36,102 --> 01:19:39,371
"I know I hurt you, and I'm sorry.

1476
01:19:39,372 --> 01:19:40,939
“Any bone-headed moves I made

1477
01:19:40,940 --> 01:19:44,242
'were born of confusion and not malice.

1478
01:19:44,243 --> 01:19:46,811
"That said, I've been feeling
lately the stirring:

1479
01:19:46,812 --> 01:19:49,581
"of something I can only call growth

1480
01:19:49,582 --> 01:19:53,118
"It's a tribute of sorts to say
that someone 16 years my junior

1481
01:19:53,119 --> 01:19:56,621
'helped me finally start acting my age.

1482
01:19:56,622 --> 01:19:59,291
"A wise man in a red hat once told me,

1483
01:19:59,292 --> 01:20:01,826
“Everything is okay.'

1484
01:20:01,827 --> 01:20:04,262
"I didn't believe him then,

1485
01:20:04,263 --> 01:20:07,767
but for some reason,
I'm starting to.'

1486
01:20:15,107 --> 01:20:17,008
- Sorry, we're closed!

1487
01:20:17,009 --> 01:20:18,843
Oh,

1488
01:20:18,844 --> 01:20:19,978
Hey.

1489
01:20:19,979 --> 01:20:21,185
- Hi.

1490
01:20:26,152 --> 01:20:28,598
- Are you here for this?

1491
01:20:30,189 --> 01:20:33,858
I always notice you reading it
when you're in here.

1492
01:20:33,859 --> 01:20:36,027
- Yeah.

1493
01:20:36,028 --> 01:20:37,803
Any bookstore I'm in, I have to read then.

1494
01:20:37,804 --> 01:20:38,969
Last three pages.

1495
01:20:38,970 --> 01:20:40,375
- I know.
They're devastating.

1496
01:20:42,234 --> 01:20:44,009
- Yeah.

1497
01:20:48,708 --> 01:20:49,708
I'm Jesse.

1498
01:20:49,709 --> 01:20:50,875
- I'm Ana.

1499
01:20:50,876 --> 01:20:53,152
- Hi.
- Hi.

1500
01:20:55,147 --> 01:20:57,215
I love books.

1501
01:20:57,216 --> 01:20:59,851
I do in, like, the dorkiest way possible.

1502
01:20:59,852 --> 01:21:00,985
- Oh, me too.

1503
01:21:00,986 --> 01:21:02,354
It's a problem.

1504
01:21:02,355 --> 01:21:06,458
- Like, I love trees cause they give us books.

1505
01:21:06,459 --> 01:21:09,461
super cool of the trees to do that, light'!

1506
01:21:09,462 --> 01:21:11,563
- I'm actually-

1507
01:21:11,564 --> 01:21:13,031
this is weird.

1508
01:21:13,032 --> 01:21:15,266
I'm actually trying to read less.

1509
01:21:15,267 --> 01:21:16,634
- WM?

1510
01:21:16,635 --> 01:21:19,013
- I felt like I wasn't watching
enough television.

1511
01:21:20,406 --> 01:21:23,842
- No, l just-I started to feel
like reading about life

1512
01:21:23,843 --> 01:21:26,911
was taking time away from actually living life,

1513
01:21:26,912 --> 01:21:30,415
so I'm trying to, like,
accept invitations to things,

1514
01:21:30,416 --> 01:21:32,259
say "hi" to the world a little more.

1515
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:35,253
- That sounds scary.

1516
01:21:35,254 --> 01:21:36,588
It's going well?

1517
01:21:36,589 --> 01:21:38,757
- It's..okay.

1518
01:21:38,758 --> 01:21:40,101
Most of the time when I'm out,

1519
01:21:40,102 --> 01:21:41,662
I keep thinking I'd be so much happier

1520
01:21:41,663 --> 01:21:43,361
in bed with a book,

1521
01:21:43,362 --> 01:21:48,266
and that makes me feel not super cool.

1522
01:21:48,267 --> 01:21:50,502
I still read tons.

1523
01:21:50,503 --> 01:21:54,105
I just feel like I'm more aware
of a book's limitations.

1524
01:21:54,106 --> 01:21:55,940
Does that make sense?

1525
01:21:55,941 --> 01:21:59,210
- Yeah, totally.

1526
01:21:59,211 --> 01:22:00,545
- How am I doing here?

1527
01:22:00,546 --> 01:22:02,423
- What?
Here in this conversation?

1528
01:22:02,424 --> 01:22:03,515
- Yeah.

1529
01:22:03,516 --> 01:22:06,861
- Very well.
You are doing great

1530
01:22:10,289 --> 01:22:14,793
So you maybe want to gel away from these books

1531
01:22:14,794 --> 01:22:17,128
and walk somewhere?

1532
01:22:17,129 --> 01:22:18,596
- Yeah, okay.

1533
01:22:18,597 --> 01:22:20,965
- Really?
do it

1534
01:22:20,966 --> 01:22:23,001
- Great.
Great.

1535
01:22:23,002 --> 01:22:25,404
And feel free to invite
your husband or boyfriend.

1536
01:22:25,404 --> 01:22:27,315
- They're both pretty busy right now, so...

1537
01:22:27,316 --> 01:22:28,649
- Probably just be us, then.

1538
01:22:28,650 --> 01:22:31,178
- Yeah.
Just us.

1539
01:23:02,007 --> 01:23:03,007
- Hello.

1540
01:23:03,008 --> 01:23:05,810
- Oh, hi.

1541
01:23:05,811 --> 01:23:07,846
It's Dean

1542
01:23:07,847 --> 01:23:10,515
Franzen?
We like the same writer.

1543
01:23:10,516 --> 01:23:12,917
- Right, hey.
up?

1544
01:23:12,918 --> 01:23:16,955
- Uh, you gave me your number,
and you told me to call you.

1545
01:23:16,956 --> 01:23:19,491
- Uh, yeah.
No, ifs good to hear from you.

1546
01:23:19,492 --> 01:23:20,859
How are you doing?

1547
01:23:20,860 --> 01:23:25,296
- Uh, I'm pretty good, yeah.

1548
01:23:25,297 --> 01:23:27,165
Things, um-

1549
01:23:27,166 --> 01:23:29,077
I've been-

1550
01:23:32,338 --> 01:23:35,340
- Dean?

1551
01:23:35,341 --> 01:23:38,142
- I just took a bunch of pills.

1552
01:23:38,143 --> 01:23:40,778
- What?

1553
01:23:40,779 --> 01:23:43,055
- I just took a lot of pills.

1554
01:23:45,050 --> 01:23:46,351
- How many'?

1555
01:23:46,352 --> 01:23:48,389
- I don't know.
Um...

1556
01:23:52,558 --> 01:23:53,730
I'm really scared.

1557
01:23:53,731 --> 01:23:55,360
- Where are you'!
- In my dorm.

1558
01:23:55,361 --> 01:23:57,328
- Stay-stay there, okay?

1559
01:23:57,329 --> 01:23:58,997
Stay right there.

1560
01:23:58,998 --> 01:24:00,909
Okay, yeah, just stay ri-
I'm gonna make a call,

1561
01:24:00,910 --> 01:24:02,233
and I'm gonna call-

1562
01:24:02,234 --> 01:24:04,043
I need you lo stay by the phone, though, okay?

1563
01:24:04,044 --> 01:24:05,106
Dean?

1564
01:24:07,673 --> 01:24:10,041
- Miss Hanson to reception area, please

1565
01:24:10,042 --> 01:24:12,113
Miss Hanson.

1566
01:24:24,924 --> 01:24:26,904
- Hey-

1567
01:24:28,227 --> 01:24:30,434
- Hey, man.

1568
01:24:31,764 --> 01:24:34,732
How you feeling?

1569
01:24:34,733 --> 01:24:38,269
- Kind of ridiculous.

1570
01:24:38,270 --> 01:24:40,838
You didn't have to drive all the way out here.

1571
01:24:40,839 --> 01:24:44,142
- I flaw, you bastard.

1572
01:24:44,143 --> 01:24:46,945
- Thanks'

1573
01:24:46,946 --> 01:24:51,282
For picking up the phone.

1574
01:24:51,283 --> 01:24:54,287
I didn't know who else to call.

1575
01:24:57,456 --> 01:24:59,624
- Can I make a suggestion?

1576
01:24:59,625 --> 01:25:00,959
- Yeah.

1577
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:02,560
- Stop reading this.

1578
01:25:02,561 --> 01:25:04,128
- WM?

1579
01:25:04,129 --> 01:25:08,132
- Because he killed himself,
and you're not gonna do that.

1580
01:25:08,133 --> 01:25:11,069
You need to read something else.

1581
01:25:11,070 --> 01:25:14,472
Listen, don'! be a genius
who dies young.

1582
01:25:14,473 --> 01:25:15,974
Be one who dies old.

1583
01:25:15,975 --> 01:25:17,976
Being old is cool.

1584
01:25:17,977 --> 01:25:20,311
Grow old and die old.

1585
01:25:20,312 --> 01:25:22,614
It's a better arc.

1586
01:25:22,615 --> 01:25:24,315
Listen to me, man.

1587
01:25:24,316 --> 01:25:29,654
This right now, all this stuff you're feeling,

1588
01:25:29,655 --> 01:25:31,923
this is a footnote, okay'?

1589
01:25:31,924 --> 01:25:33,791
You're gonna graduate,

1590
01:25:33,792 --> 01:25:36,060
and you're gonna get out in the world

1591
01:25:36,061 --> 01:25:38,496
and stumble into something like contentment.

1592
01:25:38,497 --> 01:25:41,766
I know it.

1593
01:25:41,767 --> 01:25:43,835
- In that how ifs been for you?

1594
01:25:43,836 --> 01:25:45,907
- Hell, no.

1595
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:51,342
But some days are all right, you know?

1596
01:25:51,343 --> 01:25:54,612
Some days are like a gift,

1597
01:25:54,613 --> 01:25:56,948
and some days suck.

1598
01:25:56,949 --> 01:25:59,691
But all of that's okay.

1599
01:26:02,788 --> 01:26:04,563
So I'm taking you
off post-modernists.

1600
01:26:06,859 --> 01:26:09,627
What are you prescribing?

1601
01:26:09,628 --> 01:26:13,031
- There are these vampire books.

1602
01:26:13,032 --> 01:26:15,333
The kids love 'em.

1603
01:26:15,334 --> 01:26:20,249
Trust me, they will empty your mind completely.

1604
01:26:24,209 --> 01:26:27,019
- Why are you being so nice to me?

1605
01:26:29,181 --> 01:26:31,382
You flew all the way beck here to see me,

1606
01:26:31,383 --> 01:26:34,585
and we had, like, two conversations.

1607
01:26:34,586 --> 01:26:38,489
- I have a soft spot for good readers.

1608
01:26:38,490 --> 01:26:40,265
They're hard to find these days'

1609
01:27:01,246 --> 01:27:04,982
- I really did miss you.

1610
01:27:04,983 --> 01:27:07,051
You know, we had this thing happening,

1611
01:27:07,052 --> 01:27:12,024
and it was so exciting,
and then you were just gone.

1612
01:27:13,892 --> 01:27:15,927
But it's okay now.

1613
01:27:15,928 --> 01:27:18,067
I get it.

1614
01:27:23,102 --> 01:27:28,206
I sometimes feel like
I'm looking down on myself,

1615
01:27:28,207 --> 01:27:32,877
this older, wiser mu

1616
01:27:32,878 --> 01:27:36,881
watching over
this 19-year-old rough draft

1617
01:27:36,882 --> 01:27:40,952
who's full of all this potential

1618
01:27:40,953 --> 01:27:44,288
but has to live more

1619
01:27:44,289 --> 01:27:48,760
to catch up with that other self somehow.

1620
01:27:48,761 --> 01:27:51,763
And...

1621
01:27:51,764 --> 01:27:53,131
I know I'll get there.

1622
01:27:53,132 --> 01:27:56,134
It's just sometimes I think

1623
01:27:56,135 --> 01:28:00,772
I want to rush the process, you know?

1624
01:28:00,773 --> 01:28:02,340
And I don't know.

1625
01:28:02,341 --> 01:28:09,054
Maybe-maybe I thought
you were some sort of shortcut.

1626
01:28:12,317 --> 01:28:15,161
Does that make any sense?

1627
01:28:18,824 --> 01:28:22,960
- If I wrote you, I would be like

1628
01:28:22,961 --> 01:28:25,908
"This is
the but rough draft ever.'

1629
01:28:34,139 --> 01:28:38,144
- Seriously?

1630
01:28:39,511 --> 01:28:41,013
- Roommates.

1631
01:28:44,683 --> 01:28:49,954
- Well, I should gel back lo adulthood.

1632
01:28:49,955 --> 01:28:51,155
- Yeah.

1633
01:28:51,156 --> 01:28:54,103
See you there soon, I guess.

1634
01:28:57,696 --> 01:28:59,864
. Bye, Zibby.

1635
01:28:59,865 --> 01:29:01,970
- Bye, Jesse

1636
01:29:56,255 --> 01:30:00,858
- You're so beautiful and fascinating

1637
01:30:00,859 --> 01:30:01,997
and age-appropriate.

1638
01:30:01,998 --> 01:30:03,060
- What?

1639
01:30:03,061 --> 01:30:05,429
- Oh, nothing.

# <i>E di soavi accenti...</i> #

1648
01:30:46,138 --> 01:30:48,472
- Look, you're getting wise.

1649
01:30:48,473 --> 01:30:50,641
- I'm getting old.

1650
01:30:50,642 --> 01:30:54,979
- Not the same thing.
I say you're getting wise.

1651
01:30:54,980 --> 01:30:57,483
You worry about getting old?

1652
01:30:59,051 --> 01:31:01,452
- I think being old's gonna be okay.

1653
01:31:01,453 --> 01:31:04,155
It's just the getting there
that kicks your ass, you know?

1654
01:31:04,156 --> 01:31:06,457
- You're gonna be a great old guy.

1655
01:31:06,458 --> 01:31:07,758
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1656
01:31:07,759 --> 01:31:09,227
- I feel like the nicest thing

1657
01:31:09,227 --> 01:31:10,638
anyone's ever said to me.

1658
01:31:10,639 --> 01:31:12,296
Unless it's a criticism,

1659
01:31:12,297 --> 01:31:14,799
like, "You're already judgmental and racist.

1660
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:16,667
You're gonna be
a great old guy."

1661
01:31:16,668 --> 01:31:20,137
- No, I mean you'll wear baggy pants,

1662
01:31:20,138 --> 01:31:22,006
and you'll have a little belly,

1663
01:31:22,007 --> 01:31:24,976
And when you want more coffee,
you'll say to the waitress,

1664
01:31:24,977 --> 01:31:27,345
"Could you warm this up
for me, dear?'

1665
01:31:27,346 --> 01:31:29,180
- You're right.

1666
01:31:29,181 --> 01:31:31,682
I will say that.

1667
01:31:31,683 --> 01:31:34,251
I think you're gonna be a great old person too.

1668
01:31:34,252 --> 01:31:36,789
- Thanks'

1669
01:31:38,523 --> 01:31:43,194
I want to be an old lady with
long, gray hair in a ponytail.

1670
01:31:43,195 --> 01:31:45,096
- I can see it.

1671
01:31:45,097 --> 01:31:46,872
You're still foxy.
You still got it.

1672
01:31:46,873 --> 01:31:48,538
That's what they're gonna 85”!'
about you.

1673
01:31:48,539 --> 01:31:49,568
"She's still got it.“

1674
01:31:49,569 --> 01:31:51,047
- They're saying it now.

1675
01:31:53,205 --> 01:31:56,880
And I want a really, really wrinkly face.

1676
01:31:58,577 --> 01:32:04,220
A small house, maybe by some water.

1677
01:32:12,324 --> 01:32:15,931
I think getting old could be really nice.
