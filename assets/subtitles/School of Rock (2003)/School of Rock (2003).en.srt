00:00:30,835 --> 00:00:35,738
<i>Never thought that</i>
<i>l'd be fighting you</i>

2
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,104
<i>But you stole my heart</i>
<i>You cheated and lied</i>

3
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,616
<i>You weren't in my corner</i>
<i>You weren't on my side</i>

4
00:00:46,919 --> 00:00:49,216
<i>The gloves are off</i>
<i>You hit below the belt</i>

5
00:00:52,191 --> 00:00:57,857
<i>Now it's time-out, baby</i>
<i>And they've rung the bell</i>

6
00:00:58,265 --> 00:01:00,666
<i>l'm not a fighter</i>
<i>l'm a lover</i>

7
00:01:00,868 --> 00:01:03,666
<i>But if you run</i>
<i>Then run for cover</i>

8
00:01:03,871 --> 00:01:06,840
<i>Fight for your love</i>
<i>Yeah</i>

9
00:01:14,615 --> 00:01:18,882
<i>- When it's round two, girl</i>
- Turn this up! Now!

10
00:01:19,087 --> 00:01:21,078
- Good.
<i>- l get a knockout punch</i>

11
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,259
<i>With this heartfelt song</i>

12
00:01:25,427 --> 00:01:28,955
<i>l know when l count you</i>
<i>Down from ten</i>

13
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,169
<i>l'll find you</i>
<i>ln my loving arms again</i>

14
00:01:36,172 --> 00:01:41,007
<i>The gloves are off</i>
<i>You hit below the belt</i>

15
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:46,343
<i>Now it's time-out, baby</i>
<i>And they've rung the bell</i>

16
00:01:47,551 --> 00:01:49,850
<i>l'm not a fighter</i>
<i>l'm a lover</i>

17
00:01:50,055 --> 00:01:52,718
<i>But if you run</i>
<i>Then run for cover</i>

18
00:01:52,925 --> 00:01:56,654
<i>Fight for your love</i>
<i>Yeah</i>

19
00:02:20,955 --> 00:02:22,616
<i>l'm not a fighter</i>
<i>l'm a lover</i>

20
00:02:22,824 --> 00:02:25,554
<i>But if you run</i>
<i>Then run for cover</i>

21
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,853
<i>Fight for your love</i>
<i>Yeah</i>

22
00:02:40,274 --> 00:02:43,176
Whoa, nobody caught me.
That was lame.

23
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:45,439
l don't think he's moving.

24
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,154
He is a lazy freeloader,

25
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,987
and it's time for all this
dysfunction to stop.

26
00:03:00,196 --> 00:03:02,391
Can't we just do this later?

27
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,160
l mean, you know how
he gets in the morning.

28
00:03:05,369 --> 00:03:09,499
Ned, aren't you tired of letting people
push you around?

29
00:03:09,707 --> 00:03:11,437
Yes.

30
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:14,840
Then get in there and do it.

31
00:03:18,283 --> 00:03:19,750
What?

32
00:03:19,951 --> 00:03:21,179
What is it?

33
00:03:21,386 --> 00:03:25,550
Dewey, hey,
it's the first of the month, and...

34
00:03:25,757 --> 00:03:27,919
...l'd like your share
of the rent now.

35
00:03:28,127 --> 00:03:29,856
Man, you know l don't have it.

36
00:03:30,062 --> 00:03:32,655
You wake me up for that?
Come on, man!

37
00:03:32,865 --> 00:03:34,923
Sorry.

38
00:03:38,337 --> 00:03:41,397
Dewey, l mean, you owe me
a lot of money as it is.

39
00:03:41,608 --> 00:03:43,336
Yeah, try $2,200.

40
00:03:43,543 --> 00:03:48,675
OK, you guys,
the band is about to hit it bigtime.

41
00:03:48,882 --> 00:03:52,340
We'll win Battle of the Bands.
When l'm rolling in Benjamins,

42
00:03:52,554 --> 00:03:55,318
l will throw you and your dog a bone.
Good night.

43
00:03:55,523 --> 00:03:59,255
- Your band has never made 2 cents.
- Patty, come on, l'm on this.

44
00:03:59,462 --> 00:04:01,555
Oh, you're on this?
You're on this?

45
00:04:01,764 --> 00:04:03,288
He's walking all over you.

46
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,024
Mommy, could we please
talk about this later?

47
00:04:06,235 --> 00:04:09,863
No, we can't talk about it later,
because we have to go to work.

48
00:04:10,072 --> 00:04:13,371
We have jobs.
We contribute to society. All right?

49
00:04:13,576 --> 00:04:16,774
l am an assistant to
the mayor of the city, ''hello''!

50
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:20,541
What? Can you get her out of here,
please? Why? Why her?

51
00:04:20,749 --> 00:04:23,447
And Ned has the most
important job there is.

52
00:04:24,187 --> 00:04:25,416
Temping?

53
00:04:25,623 --> 00:04:28,023
Dewey, a substitute teacher
is not a temp.

54
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,592
- He's a babysitter.
- Think it's so easy?

55
00:04:30,795 --> 00:04:33,560
l'd like to see you try.
You wouldn't last a day.

56
00:04:33,764 --> 00:04:35,823
Dude, l service society
by rocking.

57
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:38,627
l'm out there liberating people
with my music.

58
00:04:38,836 --> 00:04:41,361
Rocking ain't no
walk in the park, lady.

59
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,665
All right, this is useless,
all right?

60
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:47,778
Tell him if he doesn't come up
with the rent by the end of the week,

61
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,209
he's out of here.

62
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:52,475
Dewey, l'm not paying
your share of the rent, so...

63
00:04:52,685 --> 00:04:55,985
...maybe you should sell
one of your guitars or something.

64
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,588
What?

65
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,419
Would you tell Picasso
to sell his guitars?

66
00:05:01,895 --> 00:05:04,763
Oh, my God. He's an idiot.

67
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:09,270
Dude, l've been mooching off you
for years,

68
00:05:09,471 --> 00:05:12,701
and it was never a problem until
she showed up. Dump her.

69
00:05:12,907 --> 00:05:15,877
lf you don't come up with
some money, she'll dump me.

70
00:05:16,077 --> 00:05:18,671
Really? That would be good.
She's a nightmare.

71
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,440
Come on. l may never have
another girlfriend.

72
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:24,779
l mean, just come on.
Come up with some money, please.

73
00:05:24,987 --> 00:05:26,214
Please.

74
00:05:26,422 --> 00:05:29,549
OK. For you. Not for her, man.
For you.

75
00:05:30,492 --> 00:05:31,755
Thank you.

76
00:05:32,061 --> 00:05:33,824
<i>Heal me</i>

77
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,055
<i>l'm heartsick</i>
D minor.

78
00:05:36,265 --> 00:05:41,431
<i>l'm hungry</i>
<i>And A minor, G, on you</i>

79
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:43,765
<i>- Heal my heart</i>
- Hey! What's up?

80
00:05:43,974 --> 00:05:46,204
ls that a new song?
Who's this guy?

81
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,641
We're taking the Battle of the Bands
seriously this year.

82
00:05:49,846 --> 00:05:52,475
Good, because l need
the money. Now, listen.

83
00:05:52,684 --> 00:05:57,018
lf we're gonna win this thing, we gotta
actually start playing some music.

84
00:05:57,221 --> 00:05:58,813
l agree. You're fired.

85
00:05:59,023 --> 00:06:02,652
Your lyrics, now don't take this
the wrong way, Theo, are lame.

86
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,422
But l've been sitting on some
awesome material, so...

87
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:08,430
Did you hear what l said?

88
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:09,932
We voted.

89
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,694
You're out.

90
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:14,135
This is Spider. He's replacing you.

91
00:06:14,342 --> 00:06:16,104
What's up, dog?

92
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:21,610
l was gonna tell you last night,
but you passed out, man.

93
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:25,182
You're gonna kick me out of the band?
You're gonna fire me?

94
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,843
- lt's my band. l brought us together.
- Theo wanted you out.

95
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:33,425
- There's nothing l could do.
- Shut up, man. You voted him out too.

96
00:06:33,628 --> 00:06:35,323
Dewey, listen to me.

97
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,323
You're a good guitar player,

98
00:06:37,532 --> 00:06:42,561
but it's the 20-minute solos.
lt's the stage dives.

99
00:06:42,772 --> 00:06:47,232
We're trying to land a record deal here,
man, and you're an embarrassment.

100
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,700
Read between the lines, Theo.

101
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:52,311
Read between the lines!

102
00:06:52,514 --> 00:06:55,312
Dewey, man, l hope
this doesn't come between us.

103
00:06:55,517 --> 00:06:57,315
Like, l care about you, man.

104
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,718
You guys, you know what?
You're nuts. You're all nuts.

105
00:07:00,924 --> 00:07:03,222
You've been focused
so hard on making it,

106
00:07:03,427 --> 00:07:06,362
you forgot about one thing.
lt's called the music.

107
00:07:06,564 --> 00:07:09,158
And l don't even care.
You know what? So what.

108
00:07:09,367 --> 00:07:12,460
l don't wanna hang out with
wannabe corporate sellouts.

109
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:16,038
l'm gonna form my own band.
We're gonna start a revolution.

110
00:07:16,241 --> 00:07:20,508
And you're gonna be a funny
little footnote on my epic ass.

111
00:07:29,488 --> 00:07:31,820
l feel sorry for you guys.

112
00:07:37,731 --> 00:07:39,095
Yes.

113
00:07:39,299 --> 00:07:44,202
Yeah, it's a 1 968 Gibson SG,
mint condish.

114
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:46,867
No.

115
00:07:47,074 --> 00:07:49,669
That's all?
Well, that's a mistake.

116
00:07:49,877 --> 00:07:52,540
No, Hendrix played this guitar.

117
00:07:52,748 --> 00:07:54,509
Hello?

118
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,456
- Yeah?
<i>- ls this Mr. Schneebly?</i>

119
00:08:05,661 --> 00:08:06,957
No, he's not here.

120
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:10,859
<i>- Could you take a message for me?</i>
- Yeah.

121
00:08:11,066 --> 00:08:13,125
<i>Hi. My name's Rosalie Mullins.</i>

122
00:08:13,335 --> 00:08:17,466
l'm the principal at Horace Green Prep.
We're having a little emergency.

123
00:08:17,674 --> 00:08:20,735
One of our teachers broke
her leg this morning,

124
00:08:20,945 --> 00:08:23,209
<i>and all of our subs</i>
<i>are already working.</i>

125
00:08:23,414 --> 00:08:27,510
Pat Wickam at Milton Prep
recommended l call Mr. Schneebly.

126
00:08:27,718 --> 00:08:29,481
Do you know if he's available?

127
00:08:30,854 --> 00:08:33,790
- How long is the gig?
<i>- Excuse me?</i>

128
00:08:33,991 --> 00:08:36,118
How long is the job?

129
00:08:36,327 --> 00:08:38,056
As much as a few weeks,

130
00:08:38,263 --> 00:08:40,595
but we need somebody
to start immediately.

131
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,492
So how much are we talking here?

132
00:08:44,536 --> 00:08:47,267
We pay our substitutes
650 a week.

133
00:08:47,473 --> 00:08:50,636
<i>Now, do you know when</i>
<i>Mr. Schneebly will be back?</i>

134
00:08:50,843 --> 00:08:53,073
Hold on a sec.
Oh, you know what?

135
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,477
l think he's just coming in right...
Ned, phone!

136
00:09:04,023 --> 00:09:06,492
Hello, this is Ned Schneebly.

137
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:21,176
Pat faxed me your résumé.
lt's very impressive.

138
00:09:21,377 --> 00:09:25,107
We've never been in a bind like this
before, so thank you so much.

139
00:09:25,313 --> 00:09:28,647
So how's this gonna work?
Are you gonna pay me upfront?

140
00:09:28,851 --> 00:09:30,182
l don't understand.

141
00:09:30,386 --> 00:09:33,150
lt'd be really great
if l could get paid in cash.

142
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:35,414
Oh, well, we don't do that.

143
00:09:35,624 --> 00:09:39,618
When you cut my check, make it
payable to Dewey Finn, for tax reasons.

144
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:43,459
You can discuss all of that
with Candace at the end of the day.

145
00:09:43,668 --> 00:09:45,134
When's the end of the day?

146
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:48,362
We commence at 8:1 5,
school lets out at 3.

147
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:51,073
You know what?

148
00:09:51,274 --> 00:09:55,803
Do you think l could cut out a little
early today? l got some stuff l gotta do.

149
00:09:57,683 --> 00:09:59,480
lt's cool. l can stay.

150
00:10:00,619 --> 00:10:02,484
Mr. Schneebly...

151
00:10:02,688 --> 00:10:06,215
...this is considered the best
elementary school in the state,

152
00:10:06,425 --> 00:10:09,884
and we maintain that by adhering
to a strict code of conduct,

153
00:10:10,096 --> 00:10:11,562
faculty included.

154
00:10:11,763 --> 00:10:14,062
Don't worry about me.
l'm a hard-ass.

155
00:10:14,267 --> 00:10:17,565
lf a kid gets out of line, l got
no problem smacking him.

156
00:10:18,705 --> 00:10:21,401
No, no. We don't use
corporal punishment here.

157
00:10:21,608 --> 00:10:24,042
OK, so just verbal abuse?

158
00:10:25,312 --> 00:10:28,748
lf you have any problems with
any students, send them to me.

159
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:31,144
- l will do the disciplining.
- Check.

160
00:10:36,058 --> 00:10:38,024
Children.

161
00:10:39,027 --> 00:10:41,551
Please take your seats.

162
00:10:42,731 --> 00:10:45,529
l'd like to introduce
Miss Dunham's substitute.

163
00:10:45,734 --> 00:10:47,998
This is Mr. Schneebly.

164
00:10:49,472 --> 00:10:52,100
Why don't you write
your name on the board.

165
00:10:52,575 --> 00:10:54,406
Yes, l will.

166
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:07,248
You know what?
Why don't you all just call me ''Mr. S''.

167
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:12,456
Mr. S has never taught here
at Horace Green,

168
00:11:12,663 --> 00:11:15,827
so l want you all to be
on your best behavior.

169
00:11:16,433 --> 00:11:18,800
So the curriculum
is on the desk.

170
00:11:19,003 --> 00:11:22,440
- And do you have any questions?
- Yeah, when's lunch?

171
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,505
The children just had their lunch.

172
00:11:26,712 --> 00:11:28,908
ls there anything else you need?

173
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:34,415
l'm a teacher.
All l need are minds for molding.

174
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,022
All right, then. Well, thanks again.
You saved the day.

175
00:11:46,132 --> 00:11:49,067
OK, who's got food in here?

176
00:11:51,272 --> 00:11:54,002
You're not gonna get in trouble.
l'm hungry.

177
00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:00,312
You. What do you got?

178
00:12:05,387 --> 00:12:07,321
That's what l'm talking about.

179
00:12:11,327 --> 00:12:15,195
OK. Teach. Teach. Teach.

180
00:12:15,398 --> 00:12:18,526
All right, look, here's the deal.

181
00:12:18,735 --> 00:12:22,193
l've got a hangover.
Who knows what that means?

182
00:12:22,405 --> 00:12:27,139
- Doesn't that mean you're drunk?
- No. lt means l was drunk yesterday.

183
00:12:27,344 --> 00:12:30,745
- lt means you're an alcoholic.
- Wrong.

184
00:12:30,948 --> 00:12:33,884
You wouldn't come to work
hung-over unless you were.

185
00:12:34,085 --> 00:12:36,485
Dude, you got a disease.

186
00:12:37,655 --> 00:12:39,919
- What's your name?
- Freddy Jones.

187
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,888
Freddy Jones, shut up.

188
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:44,557
Shut up.

189
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,623
The point is,
you all can just chill today.

190
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:51,530
We'll start on
this crapola tomorrow.

191
00:12:52,237 --> 00:12:55,206
- Yes, Tinkerbell?
- Summer.

192
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:59,606
As class factotum, first l'd like to
just say, welcome to Horace Green.

193
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:02,509
- Thank you.
- Any questions about our schedule?

194
00:13:02,716 --> 00:13:05,583
Because usually now
Miss Dunham teaches vocabulary,

195
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:09,416
then gives us a pop quiz, then
splits us up into reading groups.

196
00:13:09,624 --> 00:13:11,785
- Track B is...
- OK, hey, hey, hey.

197
00:13:12,427 --> 00:13:15,329
Miss ''Dumbum''
ain't your teacher today, l am.

198
00:13:15,531 --> 00:13:17,499
And l got a headache
and the runs.

199
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:19,758
So l say, time for recess.

200
00:13:19,968 --> 00:13:23,926
But Mr. S, that poster charts
everyone's performance.

201
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:26,972
We get stars when we master
the material covered.

202
00:13:27,175 --> 00:13:29,940
How do we get gold stars
if we just have recess?

203
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:33,906
- What are these black dots here?
- Demerits.

204
00:13:37,754 --> 00:13:40,746
What kind of a sick school is this?

205
00:13:51,869 --> 00:13:57,671
As long as l'm here, there will be
no grades or gold stars or demerits.

206
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,105
We're gonna have recess
all the time.

207
00:14:00,311 --> 00:14:03,338
But Miss Dunham only gives us
recess for 1 5 minutes...

208
00:14:03,548 --> 00:14:07,747
You're not hearing me, girl.
l'm in charge now, OK?

209
00:14:08,421 --> 00:14:10,685
And l say recess.

210
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:14,157
Go. Play and have fun, now.

211
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,827
Nice.

212
00:14:17,363 --> 00:14:21,596
Now, you don't want me to have
to call your parents, do you?

213
00:14:21,802 --> 00:14:26,535
lt's all right, Emily, don't cry.
Just try to be a bit more conscientious.

214
00:14:27,307 --> 00:14:29,333
Would you like a hug?

215
00:14:29,543 --> 00:14:33,138
l'll be good, l swear!

216
00:14:33,815 --> 00:14:37,807
All right, well, that's fine, Emily.
You're excused.

217
00:14:51,735 --> 00:14:53,794
Yes, we did it.
We did it, come on.

218
00:14:54,004 --> 00:14:57,702
Give me some. Give me some.
Give me some. Give me some of that.

219
00:14:58,176 --> 00:15:01,872
l will see you cats
on the flip-flop. Later!

220
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:04,977
l heard she slipped
in the bathroom.

221
00:15:05,182 --> 00:15:08,276
Yes, but we've got
a wonderful new substitute

222
00:15:08,486 --> 00:15:10,419
who comes very
highly recommended.

223
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:14,785
- Mr. Schneebly? Mr. Schneebly?
- Yeah!

224
00:15:14,992 --> 00:15:16,653
Hold on, buddy!

225
00:15:23,502 --> 00:15:25,732
Oh, my God.
You've gotta be kidding me.

226
00:15:25,939 --> 00:15:28,703
Oh, man, this guy sucks, man.

227
00:15:28,908 --> 00:15:32,707
- Here, call him.
- Call him? Yeah, right.

228
00:15:43,056 --> 00:15:45,958
OK. Yes, you can be in my band.

229
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,355
But, Ned, no power plays, man.

230
00:15:48,562 --> 00:15:51,258
l've got vision up the butt,
so just go with it.

231
00:15:51,465 --> 00:15:53,195
No, thanks.

232
00:15:54,169 --> 00:15:55,760
You're not a teacher, Ned.

233
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,667
You're the cross-dressing,
blood-sucking incubus

234
00:15:58,873 --> 00:16:01,171
from Maggot Death.
That's the real you.

235
00:16:01,376 --> 00:16:03,937
Dewey, l'm not a satanic
sex god anymore.

236
00:16:04,146 --> 00:16:06,978
l'm a working stiff.
And that's cool.

237
00:16:07,182 --> 00:16:10,050
- She's got you brainwashed.
- l'm working.

238
00:16:10,253 --> 00:16:12,585
That's terrific.
But who are you, babe?

239
00:16:12,788 --> 00:16:14,517
This is my apartment, babe.

240
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:17,716
Not if you don't pay your rent,
it's not. Get a job.

241
00:16:17,927 --> 00:16:21,954
l got a job. l'll have rent by the end
of the week. Go tell the mayor.

242
00:16:22,164 --> 00:16:25,601
- You got a job. Doing what?
- l do what Ned does, temping.

243
00:16:25,802 --> 00:16:30,035
l'm not a temp. l'm a sub.
And soon l'll be a certified teacher.

244
00:16:30,241 --> 00:16:33,472
Come on, man!
One show, $20,000 prize,

245
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:37,614
we split it 60/40. Grab your bass
and come back to the garage.

246
00:16:37,814 --> 00:16:40,148
l mean, don't you miss rocking out?

247
00:16:40,351 --> 00:16:43,616
lf you think anyone is gonna
be in a band with you,

248
00:16:43,855 --> 00:16:45,949
you're more delusional
than l thought.

249
00:16:46,158 --> 00:16:50,560
Dewey, you know, maybe it's time
to give up those dreams.

250
00:16:50,762 --> 00:16:54,961
l did, and things are going
really great for me.

251
00:17:12,186 --> 00:17:15,849
Are you gonna teach us anything
or are we just gonna sit here?

252
00:17:17,425 --> 00:17:19,326
Just do whatever you want.

253
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:24,866
- l want to learn from my teacher.
- Besides that.

254
00:17:25,667 --> 00:17:27,999
Freddy, what do you
like to do?

255
00:17:28,204 --> 00:17:31,105
l don't know, burn stuff?

256
00:17:31,307 --> 00:17:34,401
Just go out and have recess.

257
00:17:34,611 --> 00:17:39,810
My parents don't spend $1 5,000
a year for recess.

258
00:17:41,618 --> 00:17:44,051
- You want to learn something?
- Yes, l do.

259
00:17:44,253 --> 00:17:46,221
You want me to teach
you something?

260
00:17:46,422 --> 00:17:48,755
All right, here's a useful lesson
for you.

261
00:17:48,959 --> 00:17:51,621
Give up. Just quit.

262
00:17:51,829 --> 00:17:55,163
Because in this life, you can't win.

263
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:59,463
Yeah, you can try, but in the end,
you're just gonna lose, bigtime,

264
00:17:59,671 --> 00:18:01,867
because the world is run
by The Man.

265
00:18:02,073 --> 00:18:03,473
- Who?
- The Man.

266
00:18:03,676 --> 00:18:05,269
Oh, you don't know The Man?

267
00:18:05,478 --> 00:18:06,842
Well, he's everywhere.

268
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:10,812
ln the White House, down the hall.
Miss Mullins, she's The Man.

269
00:18:11,016 --> 00:18:15,282
And The Man ruined the ozone,
and he's burning down the Amazon,

270
00:18:15,488 --> 00:18:18,616
and he kidnapped Shamu
and put her in a chlorine tank.

271
00:18:18,824 --> 00:18:23,125
There used to be a way to stick it
to The Man. lt was called rock 'n' roll.

272
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,093
But guess what. Oh, no.

273
00:18:25,298 --> 00:18:28,631
The Man ruined that too
with a little thing called MTV!

274
00:18:29,504 --> 00:18:30,903
So don't waste your time

275
00:18:31,105 --> 00:18:33,801
trying to make anything cool
or pure or awesome.

276
00:18:34,008 --> 00:18:38,172
The Man's just gonna call you a fat,
washed-up loser and crush your soul.

277
00:18:38,379 --> 00:18:41,473
So do yourselves a favor
and just give up!

278
00:18:46,455 --> 00:18:48,548
Mr. Schneebly, it's after 1 0.

279
00:18:48,757 --> 00:18:52,158
On Tuesdays, the children
have music class now.

280
00:18:52,361 --> 00:18:54,829
Right. OK. Good work, people.

281
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:59,433
We will continue with our lecture
on The Man when we return.

282
00:18:59,636 --> 00:19:02,002
Have a good music class.

283
00:20:40,045 --> 00:20:42,605
Mr. S, what's going on?

284
00:20:44,349 --> 00:20:46,647
l heard you in music class.

285
00:20:46,852 --> 00:20:49,116
You guys can really play.

286
00:20:49,321 --> 00:20:51,882
Why didn't anyone tell me?
You.

287
00:20:52,091 --> 00:20:54,082
- What's your name?
- Zack.

288
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:55,955
- You play the guitar?
- Yeah.

289
00:20:56,162 --> 00:20:57,824
OK, come here.

290
00:21:00,266 --> 00:21:03,201
- Ever play electric guitar?
- My dad won't let me.

291
00:21:03,403 --> 00:21:06,305
- He thinks it's a waste of time.
- A waste of...?

292
00:21:07,775 --> 00:21:09,435
Try this one.

293
00:21:11,078 --> 00:21:13,376
OK, here's a guitar pick.

294
00:21:13,581 --> 00:21:16,744
You pluck along with me, OK?
lf you can.

295
00:21:44,814 --> 00:21:46,146
Yes.

296
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,393
Yes!

297
00:22:04,702 --> 00:22:07,068
OK, you stay right there.
Don't move.

298
00:22:07,272 --> 00:22:09,968
Piano man, front and center.

299
00:22:10,776 --> 00:22:12,471
- What's your name?
- Lawrence.

300
00:22:12,678 --> 00:22:15,910
Lawrence, you ever
played keyboards? Any techno?

301
00:22:16,116 --> 00:22:19,313
- No, l only play piano.
- OK. All right, fair enough.

302
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:23,286
Try this out for me, OK?
Just give this a try on my count.

303
00:22:23,491 --> 00:22:25,982
One, two, three, four.

304
00:22:28,028 --> 00:22:29,724
Yes.

305
00:22:32,867 --> 00:22:34,698
<i>Come on, come on</i>
<i>Come on, come on</i>

306
00:22:34,902 --> 00:22:36,928
<i>Now touch me, babe</i>

307
00:22:37,138 --> 00:22:39,732
<i>Can't you see</i>
<i>That l am not afraid</i>

308
00:22:41,776 --> 00:22:45,144
<i>Lawrence is good at piano</i>

309
00:22:45,347 --> 00:22:48,407
<i>He shall be rocking</i>
<i>ln my show</i>

310
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:52,315
Stop. That's perfect. You're perfect.
Stay right there, OK?

311
00:22:52,522 --> 00:22:55,491
You. Could you come up here,
please?

312
00:22:55,692 --> 00:22:57,353
- What was your name?
- Katie.

313
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,256
What was that big thing
you were playing today?

314
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:01,691
Cello.

315
00:23:01,899 --> 00:23:04,424
This is a bass guitar.
lt's exactly the same,

316
00:23:04,635 --> 00:23:09,573
but instead of playing like this, you tip it
on the side, ''chello'', you've got a bass.

317
00:23:09,773 --> 00:23:11,240
Try it on.

318
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:15,412
OK, now play this note
right here. That's a G.

319
00:23:16,147 --> 00:23:18,411
OK, but let your fingers
do the rocking.

320
00:23:18,616 --> 00:23:20,776
Keep that G coming all day long.

321
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:22,282
<i>G, G, G, G, G, G</i>

322
00:23:22,487 --> 00:23:25,946
Good. Stop. Are there any drummers
in the house?

323
00:23:26,891 --> 00:23:29,985
- l play percussion.
- You couldn't play anything else.

324
00:23:30,196 --> 00:23:32,290
- Shut up!
- Come here, dude.

325
00:23:36,435 --> 00:23:39,633
Just see if you can do what l do.
Just give it a try.

326
00:23:43,042 --> 00:23:45,478
OK? Give that a try.

327
00:23:51,251 --> 00:23:52,479
OK!

328
00:23:52,686 --> 00:23:55,417
That's really good.
Just stay right here.

329
00:23:56,089 --> 00:24:00,186
All right, OK.
Lawrence, give me a G note.

330
00:24:01,597 --> 00:24:03,360
With the fifth above it.

331
00:24:03,565 --> 00:24:06,762
And the middle one.
No middle one, l changed my mind.

332
00:24:06,969 --> 00:24:08,403
Now go an octave below.

333
00:24:08,604 --> 00:24:10,630
Now give me some rhythm.

334
00:24:11,474 --> 00:24:13,566
And keep that same rhythm. Go.

335
00:24:13,777 --> 00:24:15,971
Katie, remember that note, the G?

336
00:24:16,178 --> 00:24:20,046
Play it, but also keep it rocking. Good.

337
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,274
OK, give me like a...
Like a:

338
00:24:25,555 --> 00:24:28,081
That's bad. That's like
<i>George of the Jungle.</i>

339
00:24:28,291 --> 00:24:31,160
Play it up here on the cymbal,
but really light.

340
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:34,527
Oh, that's it!
OK, keep going with that.

341
00:24:34,733 --> 00:24:38,100
You remember this thing
l taught you a minute ago?

342
00:24:40,038 --> 00:24:42,336
Yes! Yes!

343
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:46,367
All right, let's go!

344
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:57,913
Stop. You guys, stop messing around.
We've got a lot of work to do.

345
00:24:58,424 --> 00:25:02,794
OK, people, pay attention, because
l do not want to have to fail you.

346
00:25:02,996 --> 00:25:05,327
l thought you didn't
believe in grades.

347
00:25:06,233 --> 00:25:09,691
Of course l believe in grades.
l was testing you. You passed.

348
00:25:09,903 --> 00:25:12,668
Good work, Summer.
Four-and-a-half stars for you.

349
00:25:12,874 --> 00:25:17,209
Now, listen, normal kids
would have been stoked to slack off,

350
00:25:17,412 --> 00:25:20,813
but not you guys, because you're
not normal. You're special.

351
00:25:21,015 --> 00:25:23,279
Because you guys have
the right attitude,

352
00:25:23,485 --> 00:25:26,579
l think it's time we started
our new class project.

353
00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:28,279
- A science project?
- No.

354
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:32,256
lt's called...''Rock Band''.

355
00:25:32,795 --> 00:25:35,229
- ls this a school project?
- Yes.

356
00:25:35,431 --> 00:25:36,729
And it's a requirement.

357
00:25:36,933 --> 00:25:39,902
lt may sound easy,
but nothing could be harder.

358
00:25:40,103 --> 00:25:45,508
lt will test your head and your mind
and your brain too.

359
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,270
Will other schools be competing?

360
00:25:48,479 --> 00:25:50,379
You could say that.

361
00:25:50,581 --> 00:25:53,050
You could say that every school
in the state

362
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:55,446
will be competing for the top prize.

363
00:25:55,653 --> 00:25:57,120
What's the prize?

364
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:02,588
A win will go on your permanent
record. Hello, Harvard, yo.

365
00:26:03,494 --> 00:26:06,486
We're not supposed
to get started until next quarter,

366
00:26:06,697 --> 00:26:10,395
but l think we should get a leg up
on the competition, don't you?

367
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:11,865
l do.

368
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:14,938
- Who else wants to go for the gold?
- l do.

369
00:26:15,141 --> 00:26:18,703
All right. But if anyone finds out,
we'll be disqualified.

370
00:26:18,913 --> 00:26:21,905
So let's just keep it
on the down-low, shall we?

371
00:26:22,116 --> 00:26:24,607
- Can we tell our parents?
- No! Trust me.

372
00:26:24,818 --> 00:26:27,047
They don't want to know.
Keep it zipped.

373
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:30,780
All right, you guys,
let's kick it into overdrive.

374
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:33,357
What are the rest of us
supposed to do?

375
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,461
You just sit back
and enjoy the magic of rock.

376
00:26:36,664 --> 00:26:39,828
You mean we're not in the band?

377
00:26:41,136 --> 00:26:42,865
Now, hold up now.

378
00:26:43,071 --> 00:26:47,338
Just because you're not in the band
doesn't mean you're not in the band.

379
00:26:47,543 --> 00:26:49,908
We need backup singers.
Who can sing?

380
00:26:52,048 --> 00:26:53,310
You, sing.

381
00:26:53,516 --> 00:26:56,644
<i>- The sun'll come out tomorrow</i>
- Yes.

382
00:26:56,852 --> 00:27:00,344
<i>Bet your bottom dollar</i>
<i>That tomorrow</i>

383
00:27:00,556 --> 00:27:04,960
Stop. You've got it, and l don't
even know what it is, but you've got it.

384
00:27:05,162 --> 00:27:08,530
And that's why you're in the band.
You, sing.

385
00:27:08,732 --> 00:27:13,500
<i>Amazing grace</i>

386
00:27:13,705 --> 00:27:18,233
<i>How sweet the sound</i>

387
00:27:18,442 --> 00:27:21,037
<i>- That saved...</i>
- Stop, before l start crying.

388
00:27:21,246 --> 00:27:24,443
l found the missing ingredient.
You're in the band.

389
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:27,084
- l can sing.
- You can?

390
00:27:27,286 --> 00:27:29,254
All right, Summer, belt it.

391
00:27:29,455 --> 00:27:33,289
<i>Memory</i>
<i>All alone in the moonlight...</i>

392
00:27:33,492 --> 00:27:35,119
Stop. Stop. OK.

393
00:27:35,327 --> 00:27:37,558
Good. That's pretty good.
All right.

394
00:27:37,764 --> 00:27:41,064
- l can also play clarinet.
- l'll find something for you.

395
00:27:41,268 --> 00:27:45,670
When we get back from lunch, l'll
assign the rest of you killer positions.

396
00:27:50,478 --> 00:27:52,946
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

397
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,670
- There you go.
- Thank you.

398
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:56,373
You're welcome.

399
00:28:05,093 --> 00:28:07,561
- Mr. Schneebly?
- Yeah?

400
00:28:07,763 --> 00:28:08,990
Hey, what's up?

401
00:28:09,798 --> 00:28:12,733
- l don't think l should be in the band.
- Why not?

402
00:28:12,934 --> 00:28:16,371
l'm not cool enough.
People in bands are cool. l'm not cool.

403
00:28:16,572 --> 00:28:21,236
Dude, you are cool. The way you play.
Why do you say you're not cool?

404
00:28:22,546 --> 00:28:24,537
Nobody ever talks to me.

405
00:28:25,249 --> 00:28:27,115
Well, those days are over, buddy.

406
00:28:27,317 --> 00:28:30,014
You could be the ugliest sad sack
on the planet,

407
00:28:30,221 --> 00:28:33,589
but if you're in a rocking band,
you're the cat's pajamas.

408
00:28:33,792 --> 00:28:36,556
- You're the bee's knees.
- Bee's knees?

409
00:28:36,761 --> 00:28:38,387
Yeah, the bee's knees.

410
00:28:38,595 --> 00:28:40,995
You'll be the most popular guy
in school.

411
00:28:41,198 --> 00:28:42,791
OK. l'll do it.

412
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:48,530
Now, listen, this is a big commitment.
Don't say yes if you're gonna flake out.

413
00:28:49,008 --> 00:28:51,033
- l won't.
- Larry...

414
00:28:51,844 --> 00:28:54,404
...welcome to my world.

415
00:28:55,715 --> 00:28:57,205
Boom.

416
00:28:58,718 --> 00:29:01,185
Boom, a couple of these.
Now, here.

417
00:29:01,387 --> 00:29:05,154
Now give me a platform.
Let's rock, let's rock today.

418
00:29:05,358 --> 00:29:06,586
Now do it to me.

419
00:29:06,793 --> 00:29:09,456
- Let's rock, let's rock today.
- That's good.

420
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:11,324
Slap it.

421
00:29:11,531 --> 00:29:13,192
Shoot it.

422
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,130
Kaboot it.

423
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:18,430
We'll work on that later.
lt's a long shake. Get going.

424
00:29:18,639 --> 00:29:20,504
Good knuckle crack.

425
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:31,917
Lead guitar...

426
00:29:32,489 --> 00:29:34,650
...Zack Attack. Take a seat.

427
00:29:36,058 --> 00:29:39,290
On bass, Posh Spice.

428
00:29:39,496 --> 00:29:42,761
On keyboards, Mr. Cool.

429
00:29:42,966 --> 00:29:45,629
And on drums, Spazzy McGee.

430
00:29:45,835 --> 00:29:48,396
OK, Blondie, Brace Face,

431
00:29:48,606 --> 00:29:50,836
you're singing backup.

432
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:57,174
All right, Tough Guy, Shortstop,
Fancy Pants, get over here.

433
00:29:57,381 --> 00:29:58,871
You're on security detail.

434
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:02,109
Make sure no one outside
knows what we're doing.

435
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:04,185
The band's future depends on you.

436
00:30:04,389 --> 00:30:08,224
OK, your first mission:
soundproofing this room.

437
00:30:08,427 --> 00:30:10,190
Get on it.

438
00:30:10,396 --> 00:30:12,557
Can l be the band stylist instead?

439
00:30:12,765 --> 00:30:14,563
Of course you can, Fancy Pants.

440
00:30:14,768 --> 00:30:18,533
OK. Carrot Top, Roadrunner,
Turkey Sub,

441
00:30:18,738 --> 00:30:20,729
we're gonna have
a lot of equipment.

442
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,238
We're talking amps, electric guitars,

443
00:30:23,442 --> 00:30:26,275
maybe even lasers
and smoke machines.

444
00:30:26,479 --> 00:30:29,074
Now, your job is to master
the transportation

445
00:30:29,283 --> 00:30:31,479
and operation of this technology.

446
00:30:31,685 --> 00:30:35,645
Without a first-rate roadie crew,
we'll never have a psychedelic show,

447
00:30:35,857 --> 00:30:40,591
and l can't live with that, OK?
l'm counting on you. Get going. Go.

448
00:30:40,796 --> 00:30:42,730
All right.

449
00:30:42,932 --> 00:30:44,923
You three...

450
00:30:46,468 --> 00:30:48,958
...groupies.
And your job is simple.

451
00:30:49,404 --> 00:30:50,838
Just worship the band.

452
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,497
You're gonna be making hats,
you're gonna be making T-shirts,

453
00:30:54,709 --> 00:30:58,441
all kinds of merchandise, which
leads me to your first assignment:

454
00:30:58,647 --> 00:31:00,946
- Naming the band.
- Yes.

455
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,619
All right. Sit down.

456
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:09,885
As for me, l will be singing lead vocal
and shredding guitar.

457
00:31:10,094 --> 00:31:13,086
Wait. lsn't this a student project?

458
00:31:13,831 --> 00:31:17,131
- What's your point?
- Are you supposed to be in the band?

459
00:31:18,236 --> 00:31:21,467
What, you want to get rid of me?
Why, because l'm old?

460
00:31:21,672 --> 00:31:24,573
You hate teachers,
is that what you're about?

461
00:31:24,775 --> 00:31:26,801
OK, well, teachers like to play too.

462
00:31:27,012 --> 00:31:29,948
And not only am l gonna play,
l'm <i>el capitáno</i>,

463
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:33,312
and what l say goes.
So put your hands over your hearts.

464
00:31:36,155 --> 00:31:39,488
- l pledge allegiance...
- l pledge allegiance...

465
00:31:39,692 --> 00:31:42,092
- ...to the band...
- ...to the band...

466
00:31:42,295 --> 00:31:44,855
- ...of Mr. Schneebly.
- ...of Mr. Schneebly.

467
00:31:45,064 --> 00:31:48,057
- And will not fight...
- And will not fight...

468
00:31:48,269 --> 00:31:51,602
- ...for creative control.
- ...for creative control.

469
00:31:51,806 --> 00:31:53,864
And will defer to him
on all issues

470
00:31:54,074 --> 00:31:56,599
related to the musical direction
of the band.

471
00:31:57,044 --> 00:32:00,412
- And will defer to him...
- Direction...

472
00:32:03,717 --> 00:32:05,948
Let's get rocking!

473
00:32:21,838 --> 00:32:24,535
- Morning, Summer.
- Groupie?

474
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:27,904
- What's the matter?
- You want me to be a groupie?

475
00:32:28,111 --> 00:32:32,172
- Groupie is an important job.
- l researched groupies on the lnternet.

476
00:32:32,382 --> 00:32:34,612
They're sluts. They sleep
with the band.

477
00:32:34,818 --> 00:32:37,720
No. That's not true.
They're like cheerleaders.

478
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:41,756
l don't want to be a cheerleader.
Look, my mother is a room parent,

479
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,259
and she's not gonna be happy
when she hears about this.

480
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:48,832
OK, l didn't want to say this
in front of the other kids,

481
00:32:49,034 --> 00:32:51,526
but l made a special
position just for you.

482
00:32:51,738 --> 00:32:53,672
lt's the most important job
of all.

483
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,369
Band manager.

484
00:32:56,008 --> 00:32:57,874
- Band manager?
- Oh, yeah.

485
00:32:58,078 --> 00:32:59,305
What's that?

486
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:02,207
l'm gonna be busy rocking out,
so it's up to you

487
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:04,679
to make sure everyone
is doing their job.

488
00:33:04,884 --> 00:33:07,216
Summer, you're in charge
of everything.

489
00:33:08,788 --> 00:33:11,155
- OK.
- OK.

490
00:33:12,593 --> 00:33:16,324
All right, look alive. Listen up.

491
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:19,056
First thing you do
when you start a band...

492
00:33:19,267 --> 00:33:23,533
Mr. Schneebly, before we start,
shouldn't l first take attendance?

493
00:33:24,373 --> 00:33:26,136
OK, fine.

494
00:33:29,711 --> 00:33:32,077
OK. Now.

495
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,941
- Michelle?
- Here.

496
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:36,812
- OK. And Marco?
- Here.

497
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:40,420
OK. Summer. Here.

498
00:33:40,623 --> 00:33:42,784
- Let's see. Tomika?
- We're all here.

499
00:33:42,993 --> 00:33:49,056
The first thing you do when you start
a band is talk about your influences.

500
00:33:49,265 --> 00:33:53,327
That's how you figure out what kind
of band to be. So who do you like?

501
00:33:54,072 --> 00:33:56,438
- Blondie?
- Christina Aguilera.

502
00:33:56,641 --> 00:33:59,439
Who? No. Come on. What?

503
00:33:59,644 --> 00:34:02,306
- You, Shortstop.
- Puff Daddy.

504
00:34:02,515 --> 00:34:05,813
- Wrong. Billy?
- Liza Minnelli?

505
00:34:06,551 --> 00:34:08,280
What are you...? You guys!

506
00:34:08,486 --> 00:34:10,717
This project is called ''Rock Band''.

507
00:34:10,922 --> 00:34:13,518
l'm talking about bands that rock.

508
00:34:13,727 --> 00:34:15,921
Led Zeppelin.

509
00:34:21,066 --> 00:34:23,592
Don't tell me you guys
never got the Led out.

510
00:34:23,804 --> 00:34:26,034
Jimmy Page, Robert Plant?

511
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,400
Ring any bells?

512
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,338
What about Sabbath?

513
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:32,407
AC/DC?

514
00:34:32,814 --> 00:34:34,372
Mötorhead?

515
00:34:34,582 --> 00:34:37,176
Oh, what do they teach
in this place?!

516
00:34:38,419 --> 00:34:41,855
Summer, you're the class whatever,
go to the board.

517
00:34:42,056 --> 00:34:43,318
Factotum.

518
00:34:44,292 --> 00:34:45,850
''Factotor''.

519
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,721
New schedule.

520
00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:51,593
8:1 5 to 1 0, Rock History.

521
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,261
Ten to 1 1 ,
Rock Appreciation and Theory.

522
00:34:56,473 --> 00:34:58,873
Then band practice
till the end of the day.

523
00:34:59,075 --> 00:35:01,374
- What about math?
- No. Not important.

524
00:35:01,579 --> 00:35:03,478
- World cultures?
- Not important.

525
00:35:03,681 --> 00:35:06,616
We need to focus.
Don't you wanna win this contest?

526
00:35:06,816 --> 00:35:08,307
lt's prestigious.

527
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,909
Question:

528
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,145
How are we being graded
in all this?

529
00:35:13,623 --> 00:35:17,754
Since l'm band manager, and l have
the most responsibility, wouldn't...?

530
00:35:17,962 --> 00:35:22,525
Summer, if you grade-grub, l will send
you back to the first grade. You got it?

531
00:35:22,734 --> 00:35:26,397
- Back to your seat now.
- Fine.

532
00:35:26,605 --> 00:35:30,372
- What are we gonna play?
- You don't have to worry about that.

533
00:35:30,576 --> 00:35:33,305
We have awesome material,
which l wrote.

534
00:35:33,612 --> 00:35:35,205
Let's hear it.

535
00:35:36,282 --> 00:35:39,251
- What?
- Let's hear your song.

536
00:35:39,652 --> 00:35:41,450
You wanna hear my song?

537
00:35:41,788 --> 00:35:43,812
l'll play you my song,
if you want.

538
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:47,389
The thing is,
l just want you to keep in mind,

539
00:35:47,594 --> 00:35:49,721
l wrote it in, like, 1 5 minutes.

540
00:35:50,264 --> 00:35:54,497
- lt's not done. You might not like...
- Just play the song, Schneebly.

541
00:35:54,702 --> 00:35:58,968
OK, l will sing it for you,
but let me just get in the zone.

542
00:35:59,172 --> 00:36:01,573
l was not planning on unveiling it,

543
00:36:02,109 --> 00:36:04,442
but l will sing it.

544
00:36:05,847 --> 00:36:08,976
Tip of the tongue,
teeth and the lips.

545
00:36:13,356 --> 00:36:14,584
OK.

546
00:36:14,791 --> 00:36:16,189
lt starts off...

547
00:36:16,392 --> 00:36:18,384
...a dark stage,

548
00:36:18,594 --> 00:36:20,256
and then a beam of light,

549
00:36:20,463 --> 00:36:23,523
and you can see me
and my guitar.

550
00:36:27,604 --> 00:36:30,164
<i>ln the end of time</i>

551
00:36:30,373 --> 00:36:33,639
<i>There was a man</i>
<i>Who knew the road</i>

552
00:36:33,844 --> 00:36:38,804
<i>And the writing</i>
<i>Was written on the stone</i>

553
00:36:39,016 --> 00:36:42,145
And then a thin layer of fog
comes in around my ankles.

554
00:36:42,354 --> 00:36:45,915
Roadies, that means dry ice.
We're gonna talk about this later.

555
00:36:46,125 --> 00:36:48,820
<i>ln the ancient time</i>

556
00:36:49,027 --> 00:36:51,494
<i>An artist led the way</i>

557
00:36:51,696 --> 00:36:57,227
<i>But no one</i>
<i>Seemed to understand</i>

558
00:36:57,437 --> 00:36:59,234
Chimes, Freddy.

559
00:36:59,439 --> 00:37:02,203
<i>ln his heart he knew</i>

560
00:37:02,408 --> 00:37:05,400
<i>The artist must be true</i>

561
00:37:05,612 --> 00:37:10,381
<i>But the legend of the rent</i>
<i>Was way past due</i>

562
00:37:10,585 --> 00:37:13,679
And then, Katie, you come in
with the bass.

563
00:37:18,025 --> 00:37:23,157
<i>Well, you think you'll be just fine</i>
<i>Without me, but you're mine</i>

564
00:37:23,365 --> 00:37:26,198
<i>You think you can</i>
<i>Kick me out of the band</i>

565
00:37:26,401 --> 00:37:29,769
And then, Zack, you come in
with a face-melter.

566
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:35,772
OK?
<i>Well, there's just one problem there</i>

567
00:37:35,978 --> 00:37:38,344
<i>The band is mine</i>

568
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:43,384
<i>How can you kick me out</i>
<i>Of what is mine?</i>

569
00:37:43,587 --> 00:37:44,814
And then...

570
00:37:45,022 --> 00:37:47,490
<i>Hawaii Five-O.</i>
You ever see that show?

571
00:37:47,691 --> 00:37:50,592
OK, well,
there's a drum solo in it that goes:

572
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:53,087
<i>You're not hardcore</i>

573
00:37:53,297 --> 00:37:55,093
<i>Unless you live hardcore</i>

574
00:37:55,298 --> 00:37:57,562
And l want the backup singers
to be like:

575
00:37:57,768 --> 00:38:00,567
<i>Well, you're not hardcore</i>
<i>No, you're not hardcore</i>

576
00:38:00,772 --> 00:38:03,605
<i>Unless you live hardc--</i>
<i>Unless you live hardcore</i>

577
00:38:03,808 --> 00:38:08,178
<i>But the legend of the rent</i>
<i>Was way hardcore</i>

578
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,939
Boom! Big old explosion.

579
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:13,641
Some, like, confetti comes down.

580
00:38:13,852 --> 00:38:16,719
That's all l got so far.
lt's a work in progress.

581
00:38:16,922 --> 00:38:20,222
l liked it, Mr. Schneebly.
l thought it was really catchy.

582
00:38:21,828 --> 00:38:23,523
Thank you.

583
00:38:24,231 --> 00:38:26,926
Mr. S? We came up
with some names for the band.

584
00:38:27,133 --> 00:38:29,567
- Yeah? Hit me.
- The Bumblebees?

585
00:38:29,769 --> 00:38:31,829
- No, it's sissy.
- The Koala Bears?

586
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:34,269
What are you talking about?
lt's sissy.

587
00:38:34,475 --> 00:38:36,772
l need to speak
with Principal Mullins.

588
00:38:36,976 --> 00:38:39,605
Hey, Miss Mullins. Hello.
How's it going?

589
00:38:39,814 --> 00:38:42,249
- How about ''Pig Rectum''?
- Michelle!

590
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:44,043
lt's a science project.

591
00:38:44,252 --> 00:38:48,587
Listen, Ros, l was thinking
about organizing a field trip.

592
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:51,123
- What do you think about that?
- Well...

593
00:38:51,327 --> 00:38:54,421
...substitutes, as a rule,
do not organize field trips.

594
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:57,191
But l figure l'm gonna be here
for a while.

595
00:38:57,401 --> 00:39:00,301
Well, that remains to be seen.

596
00:39:00,503 --> 00:39:02,902
- Have you met our other teachers?
- No.

597
00:39:03,105 --> 00:39:06,542
But the kids could learn
by getting out of the classroom.

598
00:39:06,743 --> 00:39:09,975
lt's more complicated than that.
There's safety issues.

599
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:13,581
Parents need to be notified.
lt's against school policy.

600
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:16,686
Mr. S, l have a lot of ideas.

601
00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:20,085
How about everyone in magenta
with beads and sequins?

602
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:22,919
Billy, l'm talking to Principal Mullins.

603
00:39:23,129 --> 00:39:25,153
- Oh, hi.
- William.

604
00:39:25,464 --> 00:39:26,954
l'll make up some samples.

605
00:39:27,634 --> 00:39:31,534
Everyone, this is Ned Schneebly.
He's covering for Gail.

606
00:39:31,735 --> 00:39:34,672
Gabe Green. He teaches second.
Jane Lemmons, fourth.

607
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:36,171
Bob's our P.E. teacher.

608
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:38,775
- Roberta's our librarian.
- How do you do?

609
00:39:38,978 --> 00:39:41,606
- Care to join us, Mr. Schneebly?
- Yeah.

610
00:39:41,814 --> 00:39:46,445
- Did l say that correctly? ''Schneebly''?
- Actually, it's ''Schnayblay''.

611
00:39:46,653 --> 00:39:48,553
We were just discussing testing.

612
00:39:48,755 --> 00:39:52,624
Which test do you find most effective,
the TASS or the Wilson-Binet?

613
00:39:53,027 --> 00:39:56,019
l say no testing,
and l will tell you why, Joe.

614
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:59,222
- Gabe.
- Gabe. l believe...

615
00:39:59,433 --> 00:40:02,266
...that the children are the future.

616
00:40:02,471 --> 00:40:04,166
Now, you can teach them well,

617
00:40:04,371 --> 00:40:06,705
but you have gotta let them
lead the way.

618
00:40:07,242 --> 00:40:09,676
Let the children's laughter...

619
00:40:09,878 --> 00:40:11,869
...just remind us
how we used to be.

620
00:40:12,281 --> 00:40:14,943
That's what l decided long ago.

621
00:40:15,952 --> 00:40:17,543
lsn't that a song?

622
00:40:18,655 --> 00:40:21,885
No. l don't think so. No.

623
00:40:22,091 --> 00:40:23,388
- No?
- No, it isn't.

624
00:40:23,593 --> 00:40:25,151
You sure?

625
00:40:27,864 --> 00:40:34,202
<i>So you think you'll be just fine</i>
<i>Without me, but you're mine</i>

626
00:40:34,405 --> 00:40:39,274
<i>You think you can</i>
<i>Kick me out of the band</i>

627
00:40:40,444 --> 00:40:43,778
<i>Well, there's just one problem there</i>

628
00:40:43,982 --> 00:40:46,849
<i>The band is mine</i>

629
00:40:47,051 --> 00:40:51,113
<i>How can you kick me out</i>
<i>Of what is mine?</i>

630
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:52,552
Everybody.

631
00:40:52,758 --> 00:40:55,852
<i>- Because you're not hardcore</i>
<i>- No, you're not hardcore</i>

632
00:40:56,062 --> 00:40:59,032
<i>- Unless you live hardcore</i>
<i>- Unless you live hardcore</i>

633
00:40:59,233 --> 00:41:04,296
<i>But the legend of the rent</i>
<i>Was way hardcore</i>

634
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:06,472
All right. Good. Stop.

635
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:08,369
OK, Freddy, that was awesome.

636
00:41:08,576 --> 00:41:11,100
You're rocking,
but it's a little sloppy-joe.

637
00:41:11,311 --> 00:41:13,676
Tighten up the screws, OK?

638
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,044
Zack, dude, what's up
with the stiffness, man?

639
00:41:17,251 --> 00:41:20,743
You're looking a little robotronic.
OK?

640
00:41:20,955 --> 00:41:23,924
Let's grease up the hinges,
and listen,

641
00:41:24,125 --> 00:41:26,958
loosey-goosey, baby,
loosey-goosey.

642
00:41:27,161 --> 00:41:30,791
- l'm playing it the way you told me.
- l know, it's perfect.

643
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,937
But rock is about the passion, man.
Where's the joy?

644
00:41:35,138 --> 00:41:38,905
You're lead guitarist. We are
counting on you for style, brother.

645
00:41:39,109 --> 00:41:42,839
So try out this ancient technique.
lt's called ''power stance''.

646
00:41:43,045 --> 00:41:45,412
That's it. You own the universe.

647
00:41:45,615 --> 00:41:48,083
Now give me an E chord.
Just go:

648
00:41:48,852 --> 00:41:50,979
But let me hear:

649
00:41:51,756 --> 00:41:56,090
Yeah, now raise your goblet of rock.
lt's a toast to those who rock.

650
00:41:56,294 --> 00:41:59,752
Now smile and nod your head
and let me see your eyeballs wide

651
00:41:59,964 --> 00:42:02,125
like there's something wrong.
Yeah!

652
00:42:02,334 --> 00:42:04,234
Do it again. Give me that:

653
00:42:06,003 --> 00:42:09,064
That's what l'm talking about.
OK, let's do it again,

654
00:42:09,274 --> 00:42:11,743
from ''You're not hardcore''.
One, two, three.

655
00:42:11,944 --> 00:42:14,743
<i>- You're not hardcore</i>
<i>- No, you're not hardcore</i>

656
00:42:14,948 --> 00:42:17,940
<i>- Unless you live hardcore</i>
<i>- Unless you live hardcore</i>

657
00:42:18,151 --> 00:42:22,645
<i>And the legend of the rent</i>
<i>Was way hardcore</i>

658
00:42:22,855 --> 00:42:25,346
Yeah! Now we're rocking.

659
00:42:25,558 --> 00:42:29,120
Your homework is to listen
to some real music. Get inspired.

660
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:31,560
For Blondie, Blondie.

661
00:42:31,764 --> 00:42:34,892
For Lawrence, Yes.
That's the name of the band.

662
00:42:35,102 --> 00:42:37,731
Listen to the keyboard solo
on ''Roundabout''.

663
00:42:37,939 --> 00:42:41,807
lt will blow the classical music
out your butt.

664
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:45,446
OK, for you, Rush, <i>2 1 1 2</i>.
Neil Peart,

665
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:48,810
one of the great drummers
of all time. Study up.

666
00:42:49,651 --> 00:42:53,144
- Are we gonna goof off every day?
- We're not goofing off.

667
00:42:53,356 --> 00:42:55,119
We're creating musical fusion.

668
00:42:55,324 --> 00:42:57,452
Are we gonna do that every day?

669
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:00,026
Yeah. Get used to it.

670
00:43:00,763 --> 00:43:04,790
OK, and for you, Jimi Hendrix,
<i>Axis: Bold As Love</i>.

671
00:43:05,001 --> 00:43:08,369
- Are you psyched about the project?
- Sure.

672
00:43:08,572 --> 00:43:11,006
''Sure''? Hey. Wait. What's up?
Are you...?

673
00:43:11,208 --> 00:43:14,303
You're the lead guitarist
of an unbelievable rock band.

674
00:43:14,612 --> 00:43:17,173
- This is a dream come true for you.
- OK.

675
00:43:18,049 --> 00:43:21,041
All right. l'll see you.

676
00:43:21,252 --> 00:43:24,584
- Mr. S?
- Hey, Tomika, what's up?

677
00:43:24,988 --> 00:43:28,925
- l don't want to be a roadie.
- Why not? lt's an important job.

678
00:43:30,095 --> 00:43:31,561
All right. Well...

679
00:43:31,764 --> 00:43:34,028
You wanna be security?

680
00:43:34,633 --> 00:43:35,930
l wanna be a singer.

681
00:43:36,836 --> 00:43:38,497
A singer?

682
00:43:38,972 --> 00:43:41,202
OK. Sing me something.

683
00:43:43,877 --> 00:43:46,472
l can't let you be a singer
if you can't sing.

684
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:50,945
<i>You told me</i>
<i>To leave you alone</i>

685
00:43:51,151 --> 00:43:55,281
<i>My papa said,</i>
<i>''Come on home''</i>

686
00:43:55,488 --> 00:43:59,585
<i>My doctor said,</i>
<i>''Take it easy''</i>

687
00:43:59,794 --> 00:44:02,696
<i>But your loving</i>
<i>ls much too strong</i>

688
00:44:02,898 --> 00:44:07,767
<i>l'm welded to your</i>
<i>Chain, chain, chain</i>

689
00:44:08,136 --> 00:44:11,504
Oh, my goodness.
Nice pipes, Tomika.

690
00:44:11,707 --> 00:44:15,234
Why didn't you raise your hand
when l was looking for singers?

691
00:44:15,779 --> 00:44:17,142
You're in.

692
00:44:17,345 --> 00:44:21,442
Welcome aboard. OK, perfect.
Pink Floyd, <i>Dark Side of the Moon</i>.

693
00:44:21,651 --> 00:44:24,849
Listen to the vocal solo
on ''The Great Gig in the Sky''.

694
00:44:25,055 --> 00:44:28,114
All right? All right.

695
00:44:37,535 --> 00:44:39,195
Off to work.

696
00:44:39,404 --> 00:44:41,201
Goodbye.

697
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:53,745
You can play music
after your homework,

698
00:44:53,953 --> 00:44:56,080
after your chores,
but not until then.

699
00:44:56,288 --> 00:45:00,088
Zack! Zack, do not walk away from me
when l'm talking to you.

700
00:45:00,292 --> 00:45:02,192
lt's very rude. All right?

701
00:45:02,394 --> 00:45:05,057
Last thing...
Guitar after homework and chores,

702
00:45:05,265 --> 00:45:07,426
and only what Miss Sheinkopf
gives you.

703
00:45:07,635 --> 00:45:09,567
- No more rock music. OK?
- OK.

704
00:45:09,769 --> 00:45:11,794
All right, get to class.

705
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:13,467
Watch that attitude.

706
00:45:14,275 --> 00:45:16,402
Do you have another blanket?

707
00:45:18,646 --> 00:45:20,409
That's good.

708
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:30,884
All right. Everybody,
class has begun.

709
00:45:31,427 --> 00:45:32,654
And you know what?

710
00:45:32,861 --> 00:45:35,260
You guys have been doing
real good in here.

711
00:45:35,463 --> 00:45:38,057
lf l was gonna give you a grade,
l'd give you an A.

712
00:45:38,267 --> 00:45:39,666
But that's the problem.

713
00:45:39,868 --> 00:45:41,961
Rock ain't about doing things
perfect.

714
00:45:42,171 --> 00:45:44,367
Who can tell me
what it's really about?

715
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:47,370
Frankie?

716
00:45:48,244 --> 00:45:51,578
- Scoring chicks?
- No. See? No.

717
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:53,808
- Eleni?
- Getting wasted.

718
00:45:54,019 --> 00:45:56,044
No. Come on. No.

719
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:58,381
- Leonard.
- Sticking it to The Man?

720
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:01,057
Yes! But you can't just say it, man.

721
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,625
You gotta feel it
in your blood and guts.

722
00:46:03,828 --> 00:46:06,352
lf you wanna rock,
you gotta break the rules.

723
00:46:06,565 --> 00:46:10,023
You gotta get mad at The Man,
and right now l'm The Man.

724
00:46:10,235 --> 00:46:14,103
That's right, l'm The Man,
and who's got the guts to tell me off?

725
00:46:14,306 --> 00:46:17,708
- Who's gonna tell me off?
- Shut the hell up, Schneebly!

726
00:46:18,344 --> 00:46:20,710
That's it, Freddy. That's it.

727
00:46:20,913 --> 00:46:24,042
- Who can top him?
- Get out of here, stupid ass.

728
00:46:24,251 --> 00:46:26,220
Yes, Alicia.

729
00:46:26,487 --> 00:46:29,512
You're a joke. You're the worst teacher
l've ever had.

730
00:46:29,723 --> 00:46:31,452
Summer, that is great.

731
00:46:31,658 --> 00:46:35,117
- l like the delivery. l felt your anger.
- Thank you.

732
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:37,797
You're a fat loser,
and you have body odor.

733
00:46:38,298 --> 00:46:40,858
All right. All right.

734
00:46:41,068 --> 00:46:43,697
- Now is everyone nice and pissed off?
- Yeah!

735
00:46:43,905 --> 00:46:45,840
Good. Time to write a rock song.

736
00:46:46,041 --> 00:46:49,807
Now, what makes you mad
more than anything in the world?

737
00:46:52,816 --> 00:46:54,476
- Billy?
- You.

738
00:46:54,883 --> 00:46:57,249
We've already told me off.
Let's move on.

739
00:46:57,453 --> 00:47:01,413
- You're tacky, and l hate you.
- OK, you see me after class.

740
00:47:01,625 --> 00:47:04,560
- You. Gordon.
- No allowance.

741
00:47:06,197 --> 00:47:10,656
<i>l didn't get no allowance today</i>
<i>So now l'm really ticked off</i>

742
00:47:10,967 --> 00:47:13,561
You know what l mean?
What else makes you mad?

743
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:15,398
- Michelle?
- Chores.

744
00:47:16,073 --> 00:47:20,840
<i>l had to do my chores today</i>
<i>So l am really ticked off</i>

745
00:47:21,045 --> 00:47:23,912
- What else?
- Bullies.

746
00:47:24,115 --> 00:47:29,110
<i>All you bullies get out of my way</i>
<i>Because l am really ticked off</i>

747
00:47:32,191 --> 00:47:34,125
So, what would you say to a bully?

748
00:47:34,327 --> 00:47:36,227
- Zack?
- l don't know.

749
00:47:36,429 --> 00:47:39,159
Now, come on.
lf someone was in your grill,

750
00:47:39,365 --> 00:47:41,425
- what would you say?
- l don't know.

751
00:47:41,635 --> 00:47:43,659
lf someone was pushing you around,

752
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:45,928
- what would you say?
- ''Step off''?

753
00:47:47,006 --> 00:47:51,205
<i>Step off! Step off!</i>
<i>Step off! Step off!</i>

754
00:47:51,412 --> 00:47:52,639
Everybody!

755
00:47:52,845 --> 00:47:57,944
<i>Step off! Step off!</i>
<i>Step off! Step off!</i>

756
00:47:58,687 --> 00:48:04,125
<i>lf l do what you say</i>
<i>l might turn into a robot</i>

757
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:08,262
<i>Do my chore day after day</i>
<i>And they don't want any lip</i>

758
00:48:08,464 --> 00:48:14,699
<i>No! So step off! Step off!</i>
<i>Step off! Step off! Step off!</i>

759
00:48:14,904 --> 00:48:16,131
Step off, everybody.

760
00:48:16,338 --> 00:48:21,504
<i>Step off! Step off!</i>
<i>Step off! Step off!</i>

761
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:35,250
All right, now that was
a perfectly decent rock song.

762
00:48:42,633 --> 00:48:46,832
Oh, yeah. l was this close to getting
a chair on the Polish Philharmonic,

763
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:50,907
and l nailed the audish,
but l didn't get it. Guess who did.

764
00:48:51,109 --> 00:48:54,568
Yo-Yo Ma's cousin, little ''nepotis''.

765
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:57,874
Anyway, l just decided to give up
and become a teacher,

766
00:48:58,083 --> 00:49:01,247
because those that can't do, teach.

767
00:49:01,454 --> 00:49:05,550
And those that can't teach,
teach gym. Am l right?

768
00:49:10,664 --> 00:49:13,861
- l'm just joshing.
- Cute.

769
00:49:14,068 --> 00:49:16,127
- Hey, Mr. Schneebly.
- Hey, Zack.

770
00:49:16,338 --> 00:49:18,806
That was a really cool lesson today.

771
00:49:19,007 --> 00:49:20,269
Well, thanks, dude.

772
00:49:20,574 --> 00:49:22,565
- l'll see you back in class.
- OK.

773
00:49:52,043 --> 00:49:55,638
Flip it, flip it, flip it, flip it!
No, no, no.

774
00:51:38,791 --> 00:51:42,123
l'm just saying, name two
great chick drummers.

775
00:51:42,328 --> 00:51:44,990
Sheila E? Meg White
from the White Stripes?

776
00:51:45,197 --> 00:51:47,893
- She can't drum.
- She's better than you.

777
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,625
At least she has rhythm.

778
00:51:49,836 --> 00:51:53,864
Freddy, where are your sleeves?
And what have you done to your hair?

779
00:51:54,075 --> 00:51:58,205
- lt's called punk.
- Well, it's not school uniform.

780
00:52:00,516 --> 00:52:04,645
- Miss Mullins, you're The Man.
- Thank you, Frankie.

781
00:52:12,727 --> 00:52:14,490
Good morning.
Just a reminder:

782
00:52:14,696 --> 00:52:16,289
Parents' Night is coming up,

783
00:52:16,498 --> 00:52:19,092
and l expect everyone
to have a presentation.

784
00:52:19,301 --> 00:52:21,235
What? Hot!

785
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:26,276
- You OK?
- lt's all right.

786
00:52:27,344 --> 00:52:30,712
As you know, it is the most
important event of the year.

787
00:52:30,915 --> 00:52:33,009
The parents scrutinize
our every move,

788
00:52:33,218 --> 00:52:37,812
so l find it's best to over-prepare.
Right?

789
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:40,285
The best defense
is a good offense.

790
00:52:41,157 --> 00:52:43,752
And, Roberta, now that l see you...

791
00:52:44,729 --> 00:52:48,826
Hey, is she always like that?

792
00:52:49,267 --> 00:52:51,235
Oh, yeah.

793
00:52:52,037 --> 00:52:56,907
Except for the time she got drunk
at the alumni dinner.

794
00:52:57,110 --> 00:52:58,772
You should have seen that.

795
00:52:58,979 --> 00:53:03,438
She got up on the table and did
a Stevie Nicks impersonation.

796
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:05,710
And she wasn't bad.

797
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:09,820
Remember, she took up the tablecloth
and whirled around with it?

798
00:53:10,023 --> 00:53:12,151
...that had been
on the turkey tray

799
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:15,988
that were touched over onto
the peanut-butter-and-jelly tray.

800
00:53:16,196 --> 00:53:20,292
Now, l know that you know
that this is a severe problem.

801
00:53:26,373 --> 00:53:27,864
Clear.

802
00:53:28,309 --> 00:53:30,436
Come on. Go, go, go!

803
00:53:45,395 --> 00:53:47,795
All right, you guys.
ls everybody ready?

804
00:53:47,998 --> 00:53:50,432
- Yeah.
- Strap in. Let's do this.

805
00:53:58,509 --> 00:53:59,737
Oh, dude, cool.

806
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:13,657
Three horns.
That's very clever.

807
00:54:16,128 --> 00:54:21,088
<i>ln 1 492, Columbus</i>
<i>sailed the ocean... ?</i>

808
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,963
- Blue.
<i>- Blue. That's right.</i>

809
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:30,667
<i>OK. Now, Columbus had three boats.</i>
<i>The</i> Niña<i>, the... ?</i>

810
00:54:31,711 --> 00:54:33,179
<i>- Gordon?</i>
- The <i>Pinta</i>.

811
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:36,178
Pinta<i>, that's right. And... ?</i>

812
00:54:36,383 --> 00:54:38,442
<i>- Marco?</i>
<i>- Santa Marina</i>?

813
00:54:38,652 --> 00:54:40,518
<i>The</i> Santa Marina.

814
00:54:40,722 --> 00:54:43,658
<i>That's good.</i>
<i>Actually, it's</i> Santa María.

815
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:45,918
<i>OK. Now, you got...</i>

816
00:54:46,128 --> 00:54:48,721
<i>- Listen. Pay attention, kids.</i>
- She's gone.

817
00:54:48,929 --> 00:54:50,795
<i>l'm not afraid to flunk you.</i>

818
00:54:51,132 --> 00:54:52,361
What's up, dude?

819
00:54:52,567 --> 00:54:54,535
Check out these little kids, man.

820
00:54:54,736 --> 00:54:56,898
- Hey, shut up.
- Oh, sorry.

821
00:54:57,106 --> 00:55:01,065
Thought this was Battle of the Bands,
not the Mickey Mouse Club.

822
00:55:01,277 --> 00:55:03,405
- Want a piece of me?
- Look at this.

823
00:55:03,614 --> 00:55:05,878
Freddy! Come on, man.
We gotta focus up.

824
00:55:06,083 --> 00:55:07,812
We gotta nail this audition.

825
00:55:08,018 --> 00:55:09,816
Mr. S?

826
00:55:10,853 --> 00:55:13,847
- What's up?
- l don't think l can sing.

827
00:55:15,225 --> 00:55:18,058
What are you talking about?
Come here.

828
00:55:22,499 --> 00:55:26,561
So, Tomika, what's going on?
What do you mean, you can't sing?

829
00:55:26,771 --> 00:55:29,104
l don't feel good. l feel sick.

830
00:55:29,542 --> 00:55:32,102
- Just let Alicia and Marta do it.
- No.

831
00:55:32,311 --> 00:55:34,871
They can't sing like you can.
l need you.

832
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:37,070
What is it? Are you nervous?

833
00:55:37,816 --> 00:55:40,342
Yeah? Why?
What are you afraid of?

834
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:44,848
- They're gonna laugh at me.
- Why would they laugh at you?

835
00:55:45,058 --> 00:55:47,993
l don't know. Because l'm fat.

836
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:50,624
Tomika...

837
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:53,964
Hey, you've got something
everybody wants.

838
00:55:54,167 --> 00:55:55,863
You've got talent, girl.

839
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:59,233
You have an incredible voice.
l'm not just saying that.

840
00:55:59,507 --> 00:56:03,465
You heard of Aretha Franklin, right?
OK, she's a big lady.

841
00:56:03,677 --> 00:56:06,273
But when she sings,
she blows people's minds.

842
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,676
Everybody wants to party
with Aretha!

843
00:56:09,051 --> 00:56:11,849
And you know who else
has a weight issue?

844
00:56:12,221 --> 00:56:15,191
- Who?
- Me.

845
00:56:15,391 --> 00:56:20,419
But once l get up on-stage, start doing
my thing, people worship me.

846
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:23,725
Because l'm sexy and chubby, man.

847
00:56:23,934 --> 00:56:27,528
- Why aren't you on a diet?
- Because l like to eat.

848
00:56:27,737 --> 00:56:28,966
ls that such a crime?

849
00:56:29,172 --> 00:56:31,538
You know what?
That's not even the point.

850
00:56:31,741 --> 00:56:34,107
The thing is,
you're a rock star now.

851
00:56:34,310 --> 00:56:36,676
All you gotta do
is rock your heart out.

852
00:56:36,881 --> 00:56:38,815
People are gonna dig you, l swear.

853
00:56:39,017 --> 00:56:42,316
Let's just show them what we got.
What do you say?

854
00:56:42,686 --> 00:56:44,314
OK.

855
00:56:45,424 --> 00:56:46,981
Thank you.

856
00:56:47,492 --> 00:56:49,050
Let's rock.

857
00:56:50,229 --> 00:56:54,792
- OK. We are good to go.
- No, we're not. Freddy took off.

858
00:56:55,002 --> 00:56:57,663
- Where?
- Some guys invited him to their van.

859
00:56:57,870 --> 00:57:01,271
What?! Come on, you guys!

860
00:57:03,576 --> 00:57:05,101
Freddy?

861
00:57:05,311 --> 00:57:08,076
Hey, have you seen a little kid,
like, yay high?

862
00:57:09,315 --> 00:57:13,377
Dang it. Freddy,
this is your teacher talking!

863
00:57:13,587 --> 00:57:17,456
- Hey, Mr. S.
- Oh, man.

864
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:22,093
- What's going on here?
- Nothing. Just chilling.

865
00:57:22,296 --> 00:57:24,663
Freddy, get out of that van
this instant.

866
00:57:26,601 --> 00:57:28,432
See you guys.

867
00:57:29,238 --> 00:57:33,105
You think you're pretty funny,
partying with an innocent little kid?

868
00:57:33,876 --> 00:57:35,502
Dude, we're just chilling.

869
00:57:35,711 --> 00:57:38,305
That kid's 1 0 years old.
He looks up to you.

870
00:57:38,514 --> 00:57:43,919
You are setting an example for him,
so start acting like a responsible adult!

871
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:47,578
That goes for all of you guys.
Don't make me come back here.

872
00:57:49,726 --> 00:57:51,489
Come on. Let's go.

873
00:57:51,828 --> 00:57:54,456
What's the big deal?
You're acting like my mom.

874
00:57:54,664 --> 00:57:57,327
What's the big deal?
You had me worried sick.

875
00:57:57,536 --> 00:57:59,503
l was hanging with real rockers.

876
00:57:59,705 --> 00:58:02,037
They aren't real rockers.
They're posers.

877
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:05,003
Rock ain't about getting loaded
and being a jerk.

878
00:58:05,209 --> 00:58:09,112
Now, this is serious business here.
We've got a mission.

879
00:58:09,314 --> 00:58:12,249
Putting on a great show
is the most important thing.

880
00:58:12,451 --> 00:58:15,318
One great rock show
can change the world.

881
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:18,546
- Do you understand me?
- Yeah.

882
00:58:18,757 --> 00:58:21,659
lf you ever scare me like that again,
so help me,

883
00:58:21,861 --> 00:58:24,659
l will send a note home
to your parents. Let's go.

884
00:58:25,398 --> 00:58:28,232
All right, you guys.
Just wait here for a minute.

885
00:58:29,837 --> 00:58:32,966
- Hey, man, check this place out.
- Yeah. lt's cool.

886
00:58:33,174 --> 00:58:35,404
Hey, what's going on?
Where is everyone?

887
00:58:35,610 --> 00:58:39,307
- Auditions are over.
- What? Who's in charge?

888
00:58:39,514 --> 00:58:42,641
Listen...you can't leave.
You haven't heard our band.

889
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:46,548
- The bill is full. We're overbooked.
- Let us play one song.

890
00:58:46,754 --> 00:58:48,086
We're here. We're ready.

891
00:58:48,289 --> 00:58:49,688
- Who are they?
- My band.

892
00:58:50,025 --> 00:58:52,187
Kids? ls this some kind
of gimmick?

893
00:58:52,395 --> 00:58:55,421
lt's not a gimmick.
They're kids, but they're awesome.

894
00:58:55,631 --> 00:58:59,568
Thanks for coming down, but you're
really not what we're looking for.

895
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:02,466
These kids have worked
their fingers to the bone

896
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:06,437
just to play one song for you,
so sit down, shut up and listen!

897
00:59:06,776 --> 00:59:10,007
Sheila, call security.

898
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:14,642
Oh, God.

899
00:59:15,953 --> 00:59:17,419
lt was just a warm-up.

900
00:59:17,621 --> 00:59:20,215
We'll still compete
against the other schools.

901
00:59:20,425 --> 00:59:23,883
What? This is the gig, Summer.
This was our Woodstock.

902
00:59:24,095 --> 00:59:26,325
Then we shouldn't take no
for an answer.

903
00:59:26,531 --> 00:59:29,729
Don't take no for an answer?
He was gonna call the fuzz.

904
00:59:29,935 --> 00:59:31,927
Would you just listen to me?

905
00:59:32,438 --> 00:59:34,303
l have an idea.

906
00:59:37,543 --> 00:59:41,810
Hi there. Hi. lt's OK. lt's cool.
l just wanted to say, l'm really sorry.

907
00:59:42,014 --> 00:59:44,175
l shouldn't have barged in here.

908
00:59:44,384 --> 00:59:46,317
lt wasn't fair to you or the kids,

909
00:59:46,519 --> 00:59:48,919
especially after what
they've been through.

910
00:59:49,122 --> 00:59:53,025
God, l feel like a jerk. God.
l'm taking them back to the hospital.

911
00:59:53,227 --> 00:59:55,889
- Just wanted to say l'm sorry.
- That's fine.

912
00:59:56,097 --> 01:00:00,124
See, l volunteer down at
St. Margarita's, in the children's wing,

913
01:00:00,334 --> 01:00:02,564
- teaching music.
- Really? That's nice.

914
01:00:02,770 --> 01:00:05,205
- That's very nice.
- Actually, it isn't,

915
01:00:05,406 --> 01:00:09,138
because l totally screwed up.
l told the kids if they practiced,

916
01:00:09,344 --> 01:00:12,245
they'd get into
Battle of the Bands.

917
01:00:12,547 --> 01:00:15,948
- What did you tell them that for?
- l don't know. l just...

918
01:00:16,151 --> 01:00:20,816
l wanted to give them something to
look forward to, to keep their spirits up.

919
01:00:21,425 --> 01:00:23,153
Look at them.

920
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:25,526
They're terminal.

921
01:00:26,162 --> 01:00:27,527
Every last one of them.

922
01:00:31,534 --> 01:00:33,901
- Jeez.
- Yeah, and all they wanted to do

923
01:00:34,104 --> 01:00:37,268
before they bit the dust
was play Battle of the Bands.

924
01:00:37,742 --> 01:00:39,209
What do they all have?

925
01:00:40,445 --> 01:00:42,743
lt's a...

926
01:00:42,947 --> 01:00:47,816
lt's a rare blood disease.
''Stick-it-to-da-man-niosis''.

927
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,317
What's that?
l've never heard of it.

928
01:00:51,522 --> 01:00:54,515
You're lucky. Because it's hell.

929
01:00:55,093 --> 01:00:56,789
Wow.

930
01:01:07,908 --> 01:01:09,934
- We're on the bill.
- Yes!

931
01:01:10,578 --> 01:01:13,411
Cut it out! You're dying, remember?

932
01:01:15,583 --> 01:01:17,210
Get in the van.

933
01:01:33,536 --> 01:01:35,697
<i>We come from the land</i>
<i>Of the ice and snow</i>

934
01:01:35,905 --> 01:01:38,703
<i>From the midnight sun</i>
<i>Where the hot springs blow</i>

935
01:01:38,908 --> 01:01:41,172
<i>The hammer of the gods</i>

936
01:01:41,444 --> 01:01:44,777
Summer, you get an A-plus
and 50 gold stars.

937
01:01:45,348 --> 01:01:48,442
- l didn't do it for the grade.
- Give me some of that.

938
01:01:48,652 --> 01:01:51,018
Yeah! Yeah!

939
01:02:00,064 --> 01:02:02,431
And it was so scary.

940
01:02:15,648 --> 01:02:17,707
Hey, Mr. S?

941
01:02:17,950 --> 01:02:20,043
We have a name for the band.

942
01:02:20,253 --> 01:02:21,812
Hit me.

943
01:02:25,859 --> 01:02:28,054
The School of Rock.

944
01:02:30,264 --> 01:02:34,200
The School of Rock.

945
01:02:36,770 --> 01:02:42,470
And we shall teach
rock 'n' roll to the world.

946
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:48,344
<i>There's no way you can stop</i>

947
01:02:48,751 --> 01:02:53,347
<i>The School of Rock</i>
<i>Yeah</i>

948
01:02:53,922 --> 01:02:56,357
Stop. We have a red alert.
lt's Mullins.

949
01:02:56,559 --> 01:02:58,584
Let's go. Come on.

950
01:02:58,927 --> 01:03:02,123
To your positions.
To your positions!

951
01:03:05,434 --> 01:03:07,494
Come on, come on.

952
01:03:15,078 --> 01:03:20,484
And therefore, E=MC².

953
01:03:20,686 --> 01:03:22,449
Oh, Miss Mullins. Come in.

954
01:03:22,654 --> 01:03:26,853
l'm sorry to interrupt, but Miss
Lemmons said she heard music

955
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:30,825
- coming from the classroom.
- Music?

956
01:03:32,029 --> 01:03:34,896
Music. l haven't heard any music.

957
01:03:35,099 --> 01:03:38,866
You know what? Miss Lemmons
must be on crack, right, kids?

958
01:03:40,606 --> 01:03:44,407
Well... Well, what's that?

959
01:03:49,016 --> 01:03:51,348
Oh, that. Yeah.

960
01:03:51,552 --> 01:03:54,418
We were singing. We were singing
and learning.

961
01:03:55,689 --> 01:03:58,419
We were learning in sing-song.

962
01:03:59,928 --> 01:04:02,590
- One of your methods?
- Yeah.

963
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:05,856
l find it's helpful when
you're teaching the subjects

964
01:04:06,067 --> 01:04:08,399
that are the boring subjects.

965
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:17,401
Well, you don't mind if l just sit in
on your class this afternoon, do you?

966
01:04:17,613 --> 01:04:20,275
No. No. Come on back
this afternoon.

967
01:04:20,483 --> 01:04:22,610
lt is the afternoon. l meant now.

968
01:04:24,553 --> 01:04:29,184
So please just continue
with your method.

969
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:32,662
Yeah. OK.

970
01:04:48,613 --> 01:04:52,744
<i>Math is a wonderful thing</i>

971
01:04:54,052 --> 01:04:57,886
<i>Math is a really cool thing</i>

972
01:04:58,458 --> 01:05:00,790
<i>So get off your ''ath''</i>
<i>Let's do some math</i>

973
01:05:00,994 --> 01:05:04,361
<i>Math, math, math, math, math</i>

974
01:05:06,466 --> 01:05:10,994
<i>- Three minus four is...</i>
- Negative one.

975
01:05:11,204 --> 01:05:12,671
That's right.

976
01:05:13,138 --> 01:05:18,134
<i>And six times a billion is...</i>

977
01:05:19,946 --> 01:05:22,473
- Six billion?
- Nailed it.

978
01:05:22,684 --> 01:05:27,678
<i>And 54 is 45 more than...</i>
<i>What is the answer, Marta?</i>

979
01:05:27,889 --> 01:05:31,291
- Nine.
<i>- No, it's eight</i>

980
01:05:33,329 --> 01:05:35,764
<i>No, it's nine</i>

981
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:42,695
<i>Yes, l was testing you</i>
<i>lt's nine</i>

982
01:05:42,904 --> 01:05:46,500
<i>And that's a magic number</i>

983
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:52,676
l'm very happy that you're able
to extend your stay,

984
01:05:52,883 --> 01:05:58,753
but l must say, l find your methods
of teaching very unusual.

985
01:05:58,956 --> 01:06:03,553
Well, l did study with
Dr. Errol Von Straussenburgerbecken.

986
01:06:04,029 --> 01:06:06,428
- Who?
- Oh, you don't know him?

987
01:06:06,631 --> 01:06:12,901
Oh, he's, like, one of the leading
leaders in...unusual methods.

988
01:06:13,105 --> 01:06:17,235
Actually, he's how l was appointed
to the Presidential Council

989
01:06:17,510 --> 01:06:20,172
for Experimental Educationers.

990
01:06:20,379 --> 01:06:22,006
That sounds very impressive,

991
01:06:22,214 --> 01:06:26,515
but we're not interested
in experimental education here.

992
01:06:27,053 --> 01:06:32,081
So if from now on you could just stick
to the curriculum, that would be great.

993
01:06:32,292 --> 01:06:34,726
- Yes. Right.
- Thank you.

994
01:06:35,195 --> 01:06:36,891
Ros?

995
01:06:37,398 --> 01:06:39,093
- Yes?
- Do you know,

996
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:44,238
l would really love to talk some more
about your philosophy on teaching.

997
01:06:44,439 --> 01:06:47,236
Do you think maybe we could
grab some coffee?

998
01:06:47,509 --> 01:06:49,704
You want to go
get some coffee with me?

999
01:06:50,245 --> 01:06:51,735
Yeah. l really would.

1000
01:06:58,387 --> 01:07:03,257
- You're sure you don't have coffee?
- l'm quite sure.

1001
01:07:05,762 --> 01:07:09,460
Well, l've never been here before.

1002
01:07:11,635 --> 01:07:15,401
l've never been to this side
of town before, in fact.

1003
01:07:16,341 --> 01:07:18,741
So l have been...

1004
01:07:18,944 --> 01:07:24,346
Well, l've been... l've been dying
to ask you something, Mr. Schneebly.

1005
01:07:24,548 --> 01:07:28,314
- Please, call me ''Dewey''.
- Dewey?

1006
01:07:29,154 --> 01:07:32,123
Ned. Call me ''Ned''.

1007
01:07:32,324 --> 01:07:36,091
l was thinking of my other name.
My middle name.

1008
01:07:37,697 --> 01:07:40,132
- Yeah.
- Well, Ned...

1009
01:07:43,203 --> 01:07:46,264
...in your experience,
how does Horace Green compare

1010
01:07:46,474 --> 01:07:48,908
to the other schools
that you've taught at?

1011
01:07:49,110 --> 01:07:51,134
Oh, your school is the best.

1012
01:07:51,878 --> 01:07:53,936
- You're just saying that.
- l'm not.

1013
01:07:54,146 --> 01:07:57,708
You know that kids at other schools
just have fun all the time?

1014
01:07:57,918 --> 01:08:01,946
They run around. There's no discipline.
They're happy. lt's anarchy.

1015
01:08:02,156 --> 01:08:05,957
This is the best school
l have ever teached at. l swear.

1016
01:08:06,861 --> 01:08:08,830
l'll drink to that.

1017
01:08:15,171 --> 01:08:17,502
Stay there. l'm gonna put on
some music.

1018
01:08:54,914 --> 01:08:57,474
- l love this song.
- Really?

1019
01:08:57,684 --> 01:09:00,174
- Yes. Stevie Nicks.
- Yeah.

1020
01:09:00,653 --> 01:09:01,915
Stevie!

1021
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:05,284
You know, she came to town,
and she did a concert,

1022
01:09:05,491 --> 01:09:10,155
- and she was just so...wild.
- l know. Oh, man.

1023
01:09:10,363 --> 01:09:13,264
- Oh, my gosh.
- She put on the best show ever.

1024
01:09:15,201 --> 01:09:17,602
She's better live
than she is on the album.

1025
01:09:17,806 --> 01:09:19,864
- You know what l mean?
- Yes, yes.

1026
01:09:20,075 --> 01:09:23,374
- Oh, my gosh, no comparison.
- Yeah.

1027
01:09:23,845 --> 01:09:25,278
You know what?

1028
01:09:25,647 --> 01:09:28,708
Oh, man, l would love
to take the kids to a concert.

1029
01:09:28,918 --> 01:09:30,249
- Concert?
- Yeah.

1030
01:09:30,986 --> 01:09:33,318
There's one at the end
of the month.

1031
01:09:33,522 --> 01:09:38,049
The Philharmonic. They do classics.
They do Beethoven, Mozart...

1032
01:09:38,727 --> 01:09:41,026
...Enya, that kind of stuff.

1033
01:09:43,666 --> 01:09:46,192
But you have a policy
about field trips.

1034
01:09:47,337 --> 01:09:50,637
- Would it be educational?
- Would it be educational?

1035
01:09:50,842 --> 01:09:53,333
lt could be very educational.

1036
01:09:56,347 --> 01:09:58,577
- Maybe we can make an exception.
- Yes!

1037
01:09:58,783 --> 01:10:00,808
<i>Sings a song</i>
<i>Sounds like she's singing</i>

1038
01:10:01,486 --> 01:10:04,386
<i>Ooh, baby, ooh, ooh</i>

1039
01:10:04,921 --> 01:10:07,117
l'm holding you to that.

1040
01:10:07,358 --> 01:10:09,087
Make an exception.

1041
01:10:10,295 --> 01:10:14,128
<i>Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh</i>

1042
01:10:18,437 --> 01:10:19,666
<i>Tomorrow</i>

1043
01:10:20,306 --> 01:10:26,575
<i>Keeping your head over water</i>
<i>Making a wave when you can</i>

1044
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:29,944
<i>Temporary layoff</i>
<i>Good time</i>

1045
01:10:30,151 --> 01:10:33,348
<i>Easy credit rip-off</i>
<i>Good time</i>

1046
01:10:33,820 --> 01:10:37,847
<i>Scratching and surviving</i>
<i>Good time</i>

1047
01:10:38,057 --> 01:10:40,083
Would you stop that, please?

1048
01:10:40,293 --> 01:10:41,727
Yeah.

1049
01:10:43,165 --> 01:10:47,727
- l had a really nice time.
- Yeah, ditto.

1050
01:10:48,236 --> 01:10:50,796
This is the first time
a teacher has asked me

1051
01:10:51,006 --> 01:10:54,339
- to do anything outside of school.
- No way.

1052
01:10:54,609 --> 01:10:56,702
lt's... lt's true.

1053
01:10:56,978 --> 01:10:59,776
ln six years.

1054
01:11:01,751 --> 01:11:03,685
Well, you know,

1055
01:11:03,886 --> 01:11:07,880
l think it might be one of those things
where people are intimidated.

1056
01:11:08,091 --> 01:11:10,820
lntimidated?

1057
01:11:11,027 --> 01:11:12,859
- They hate me.
- No. They don't.

1058
01:11:13,062 --> 01:11:15,862
Yes, they do. They sure do.
l can see.

1059
01:11:16,067 --> 01:11:17,967
l wasn't always like this.

1060
01:11:18,169 --> 01:11:22,070
l wasn't always wound this tight.
There was a time when l was fun.

1061
01:11:22,407 --> 01:11:25,501
l was funny. l was.

1062
01:11:25,710 --> 01:11:32,048
But you can't be funny and be
the principal of a prep school.

1063
01:11:32,251 --> 01:11:35,449
No, you cannot, because
when it comes to their kids,

1064
01:11:35,655 --> 01:11:38,749
these parents,
they have no sense of humor.

1065
01:11:39,458 --> 01:11:44,192
lf anything goes wrong, it's my head.
lt's my head in the smasher.

1066
01:11:44,397 --> 01:11:48,697
These parents will come down
on me like a nuclear bomb.

1067
01:11:48,901 --> 01:11:52,065
l can't make a mistake.
l gotta be perfect.

1068
01:11:52,271 --> 01:11:58,542
And that pressure has turned me into
one thing that l never wanted to be.

1069
01:11:58,979 --> 01:12:00,811
<i>A bitch.</i>

1070
01:12:01,015 --> 01:12:04,952
- No. You're not.
- Yes, l am. l am a big one.

1071
01:12:05,686 --> 01:12:10,021
Well, l don't think so.
l think you're pretty cool.

1072
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,588
Really?

1073
01:12:13,128 --> 01:12:16,791
- No.
- Yeah. You're way cool.

1074
01:12:17,099 --> 01:12:18,828
Really?

1075
01:12:22,738 --> 01:12:24,933
- OK, drums?
- House.

1076
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:27,200
- Keyboards?
- House.

1077
01:12:27,410 --> 01:12:30,608
- Amps? All right. Cable?
- Got them.

1078
01:12:30,814 --> 01:12:32,281
- All right. Guitar?
- Yes.

1079
01:12:32,483 --> 01:12:33,848
- Mr. S.
- Yeah?

1080
01:12:34,052 --> 01:12:35,848
What do you think?

1081
01:12:43,528 --> 01:12:45,018
l don't know. l...

1082
01:12:45,230 --> 01:12:47,721
They might be a little distracting.

1083
01:12:47,932 --> 01:12:51,596
lt's glitter rock and it's glam
and it's fabulous.

1084
01:12:53,171 --> 01:12:55,537
Billy, it's just not the right style.

1085
01:12:55,740 --> 01:12:57,901
You're gonna talk to me
about style?

1086
01:12:58,110 --> 01:13:00,773
You can't dress yourself.
Look at that bow tie.

1087
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:02,778
Don't talk about my bow tie.

1088
01:13:02,983 --> 01:13:06,713
You know what, l give up.
They can just wear their uniforms.

1089
01:13:07,354 --> 01:13:11,484
- That's not a bad idea.
- Not a bad idea?

1090
01:13:11,692 --> 01:13:14,252
- l was kidding.
- Excuse me.

1091
01:13:15,429 --> 01:13:19,366
- Hey, hey. What is that?
- What's what?

1092
01:13:19,567 --> 01:13:22,798
- What are you playing?
- Just something l wrote.

1093
01:13:23,037 --> 01:13:24,334
You wrote a song?

1094
01:13:25,974 --> 01:13:29,376
- Well, let's hear it.
- No, it's not that good.

1095
01:13:29,744 --> 01:13:32,804
Come on, l want to hear it,
Kurt Cobain.

1096
01:13:33,681 --> 01:13:36,651
- OK, but l'm not much of a singer.
- lt's all right.

1097
01:13:39,254 --> 01:13:42,315
<i>Baby, we were making straight A's</i>

1098
01:13:42,525 --> 01:13:45,517
<i>But we were stuck in a dumb daze</i>

1099
01:13:46,163 --> 01:13:49,621
<i>Don't take much</i>
<i>To memorize your lies</i>

1100
01:13:49,834 --> 01:13:51,893
<i>Feel like l've been hypnotized</i>

1101
01:13:52,103 --> 01:13:56,765
Wait. You wrote that?
You wrote that?

1102
01:13:57,374 --> 01:13:59,808
That's it.
Guys, rock 'n' roll positions.

1103
01:14:00,010 --> 01:14:02,878
- What are you doing?
- We're gonna learn your song.

1104
01:14:03,079 --> 01:14:05,480
- But why?
- That's what bands do, man.

1105
01:14:05,717 --> 01:14:08,242
Play each other's songs.
You got lyrics?

1106
01:14:08,887 --> 01:14:10,582
Hook me up.

1107
01:14:12,425 --> 01:14:15,326
No more secret songs.
All right, Lawrence,

1108
01:14:15,528 --> 01:14:18,292
no more reading. Time for rock.

1109
01:14:18,631 --> 01:14:21,100
Get on the drum. Bass it up.

1110
01:14:21,301 --> 01:14:22,789
- What was that chord?
- D.

1111
01:14:23,001 --> 01:14:24,799
- Play it.
- D...

1112
01:14:25,004 --> 01:14:29,668
...C, G, C.

1113
01:14:29,876 --> 01:14:33,573
<i>- Baby, we were making straight A's</i>
- Yeah. Yeah.

1114
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:36,773
<i>But we were stuck in a dumb daze</i>

1115
01:14:36,984 --> 01:14:39,475
<i>Don't take much</i>
<i>To memorize your lies</i>

1116
01:14:39,686 --> 01:14:43,214
<i>And if you wanna be</i>
<i>The teacher's pet</i>

1117
01:14:43,425 --> 01:14:46,451
<i>Baby, you just better forget it</i>

1118
01:14:46,661 --> 01:14:49,494
<i>Rock is the reason</i>
<i>Rock is the rhyme</i>

1119
01:14:49,697 --> 01:14:51,996
Know what would be better?

1120
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:54,795
''Rock got no reason,
Rock got no rhyme.''

1121
01:14:55,004 --> 01:15:00,066
Can we try that? Also, we need
some ''ooh la-la's'', so like:

1122
01:15:00,276 --> 01:15:02,767
Try that. Can we take
it from the chorus?

1123
01:15:02,978 --> 01:15:05,606
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three.

1124
01:15:05,815 --> 01:15:09,252
<i>And if you wanna be</i>
<i>The teacher's pet</i>

1125
01:15:09,453 --> 01:15:12,513
<i>Baby, you just better forget it</i>

1126
01:15:12,722 --> 01:15:15,816
<i>Rock got no reason</i>
<i>Rock got no rhyme</i>

1127
01:15:16,526 --> 01:15:22,523
<i>You'd better get me to school on time</i>
<i>And if you wanna be the teacher's pet</i>

1128
01:15:22,733 --> 01:15:25,759
<i>Baby, you just better forget it</i>

1129
01:15:25,970 --> 01:15:29,771
<i>Rock got no reason</i>
<i>Rock got no rhyme</i>

1130
01:15:29,975 --> 01:15:33,672
<i>You better get me to school on time</i>

1131
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:44,451
l'm gonna solo there
if it's cool with you.

1132
01:15:44,656 --> 01:15:46,625
- All right.
- You can solo later.

1133
01:15:46,826 --> 01:15:50,023
- OK.
- Let me rock a solo there, l can feel it.

1134
01:16:01,002 --> 01:16:03,334
Tomorrow is the big day,
so get your rest.

1135
01:16:03,539 --> 01:16:06,939
No late parties, drinking tequila
and trying to get lucky.

1136
01:16:08,309 --> 01:16:11,301
Chances like this do not
come around every day.

1137
01:16:11,846 --> 01:16:13,474
You've played hard in here,

1138
01:16:13,682 --> 01:16:17,345
and l am proud of every
last stinking one of you.

1139
01:16:18,287 --> 01:16:22,054
Let's just give this everything we got.
We may fall on our faces,

1140
01:16:22,258 --> 01:16:25,285
but if we do,
we will fall with dignity!

1141
01:16:25,696 --> 01:16:28,494
With a guitar in our hands
and rock in our hearts!

1142
01:16:28,699 --> 01:16:30,690
And in the words of AC/DC:

1143
01:16:30,901 --> 01:16:34,598
''We roll tonight to the guitar bite,

1144
01:16:34,805 --> 01:16:38,205
''and for those about to rock...

1145
01:16:38,409 --> 01:16:40,342
''...l salute you.''

1146
01:16:54,527 --> 01:16:58,430
Ros, excuse me, wanted to remind
you about our field trip tomorrow.

1147
01:16:58,632 --> 01:17:02,260
- What field trip?
- The educational concert.

1148
01:17:02,469 --> 01:17:04,801
Oh, l forgot about that.

1149
01:17:05,005 --> 01:17:08,964
l don't know, school policy
is very difficult to get around.

1150
01:17:09,176 --> 01:17:11,736
But you said
we could make an exception,

1151
01:17:11,945 --> 01:17:14,846
and the kids are excited
about hearing some Mozart.

1152
01:17:15,049 --> 01:17:19,282
l know, but the preparations,
there's not enough time.

1153
01:17:19,486 --> 01:17:21,956
l don't know anything about it.
Where is it?

1154
01:17:22,358 --> 01:17:26,987
l've got it all covered.
What's going on, are you mad at me?

1155
01:17:27,195 --> 01:17:30,392
No, no, Ned. l'm sorry,
l'm just a little stressed out

1156
01:17:30,598 --> 01:17:32,623
because it's Parents' Night tonight.

1157
01:17:32,835 --> 01:17:37,569
Hey, it's all gonna be fine.

1158
01:17:40,744 --> 01:17:46,114
Ned, would you mind coming
with me tonight to Parents' Night?

1159
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:51,017
lt wouldn't be a date or anything.
l get nervous around the parents,

1160
01:17:51,222 --> 01:17:54,885
and there's something about you
that makes me feel more relaxed.

1161
01:17:55,093 --> 01:17:57,823
You know what,
that sounds so great, Ros, but...

1162
01:17:59,163 --> 01:18:03,624
- But what?
- l wasn't planning on going tonight.

1163
01:18:03,902 --> 01:18:08,169
You have to. You're their teacher.
You have to give the presentation.

1164
01:18:08,374 --> 01:18:12,002
Oh, yeah, yeah. No, l got you.
l'm ready for that.

1165
01:18:12,412 --> 01:18:14,073
So we'll go together?

1166
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:19,012
OK. Why don't you pick me up at,
say, 6:40.

1167
01:18:19,218 --> 01:18:21,778
- Done. All right.
- OK.

1168
01:18:28,228 --> 01:18:33,394
- What are you all dressed up for?
- l got a hot date.

1169
01:18:33,935 --> 01:18:35,424
That's weird.

1170
01:18:35,636 --> 01:18:39,095
l got a check from Horace
Green Prep for $1 ,200.

1171
01:18:39,708 --> 01:18:41,266
l've never worked there.

1172
01:18:44,179 --> 01:18:47,637
- What are you doing?
- Calling the school.

1173
01:18:49,049 --> 01:18:51,450
Hi, this is Ned Schneebly...

1174
01:18:55,457 --> 01:18:57,050
Dewey?

1175
01:18:57,260 --> 01:18:58,625
What's going on?

1176
01:18:58,828 --> 01:19:01,661
l told them 1 5 times,
make it out to cash!

1177
01:19:03,467 --> 01:19:04,866
Dewey?

1178
01:19:05,669 --> 01:19:07,637
l did something bad, Ned.

1179
01:19:08,172 --> 01:19:10,003
- No.
- Yeah.

1180
01:19:10,207 --> 01:19:13,609
They called for a sub. l said
l was you, to make some money.

1181
01:19:13,811 --> 01:19:17,008
But then l got there, and the kids,
they rock, man.

1182
01:19:17,214 --> 01:19:21,173
There's this kid Larry who's like,
''l'm not cool,'' but now he's like:

1183
01:19:23,054 --> 01:19:25,522
There's this other girl
who can sing like:

1184
01:19:25,890 --> 01:19:30,520
She thought she was too fat, so they
were dying, and the principal got drunk.

1185
01:19:30,729 --> 01:19:34,529
Now we're playing Battle of the Bands.
lt's the coolest thing!

1186
01:19:34,733 --> 01:19:36,893
One day.
Then l will come clean.

1187
01:19:37,101 --> 01:19:41,163
l'll tell everyone it was my fault.
You'll be fine. One day!

1188
01:19:41,373 --> 01:19:43,637
- Ned, home.
- Don't say anything to her.

1189
01:19:43,843 --> 01:19:46,369
She'll blow everything. Please?

1190
01:19:50,251 --> 01:19:53,015
Hey. What's going on?

1191
01:19:53,853 --> 01:19:57,346
Nothing. l got a hot date,
that's what's going on.

1192
01:20:00,094 --> 01:20:01,960
See you later.

1193
01:20:08,203 --> 01:20:09,932
What's going on, Ned?

1194
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:14,303
- Nothing.
- Nothing? Well...

1195
01:20:29,459 --> 01:20:33,259
OK, l don't think l can go in there.

1196
01:20:34,431 --> 01:20:36,991
- What's wrong?
- Ros...

1197
01:20:38,503 --> 01:20:40,060
...l'm not a teacher.

1198
01:20:41,139 --> 01:20:44,700
Oh, Ned. A substitute is a teacher.

1199
01:20:44,910 --> 01:20:48,505
No, no. l'm not a teacher.
l'm a fraud.

1200
01:20:48,714 --> 01:20:51,205
No. You're not.

1201
01:20:51,418 --> 01:20:56,218
You're a dedicated, talented teacher,
and those parents are gonna love you.

1202
01:20:56,422 --> 01:21:01,121
Just get in there and tell those parents
what you've been teaching their kids.

1203
01:21:01,427 --> 01:21:04,864
Yeah, you know, math, English...

1204
01:21:06,399 --> 01:21:10,700
What...? Science... What else?
Geography, history,

1205
01:21:10,905 --> 01:21:14,500
Latin, Spanish, French,

1206
01:21:14,709 --> 01:21:18,907
Latin... Math.
Did l say that already?

1207
01:21:19,113 --> 01:21:24,949
Anyway, all the stuff you want your
kids to know, it's been covered, OK?

1208
01:21:25,153 --> 01:21:26,951
So...

1209
01:21:28,691 --> 01:21:32,456
...it was great to meet you all,
and drive safe.

1210
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:34,026
Excuse me.

1211
01:21:34,229 --> 01:21:37,165
Since you started,
all my son talks about is music.

1212
01:21:37,367 --> 01:21:41,463
He says he wants to be a musician.
ls this your influence?

1213
01:21:41,671 --> 01:21:44,868
Why has my daughter become
obsessed with David Geffen?

1214
01:21:45,075 --> 01:21:46,872
And how is this homework?

1215
01:21:47,177 --> 01:21:51,671
OK, see, l would like to tell you about
what we've been doing in here,

1216
01:21:51,881 --> 01:21:55,716
but there's such a thing as
teacher-student confidentiality,

1217
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:58,913
and l don't want to be in breach
of educational law

1218
01:21:59,124 --> 01:22:03,151
because l could be dismembered
by the teacher's union.

1219
01:22:03,428 --> 01:22:04,655
So...

1220
01:22:04,862 --> 01:22:07,297
You expect us to believe
this garbage?

1221
01:22:08,567 --> 01:22:12,231
Mr. S, don't you think you should
tell them about the project?

1222
01:22:12,438 --> 01:22:14,667
- What project?
- Our class project.

1223
01:22:14,873 --> 01:22:17,035
Every school in the state
is competing.

1224
01:22:17,242 --> 01:22:19,768
- Competing?
- lt's not till next quarter,

1225
01:22:19,979 --> 01:22:22,209
but Mr. S wanted us
to get a head start.

1226
01:22:22,415 --> 01:22:25,647
- Well, what's the project, Summer?
- lt's prestigious.

1227
01:22:25,853 --> 01:22:28,083
A win will go on our permanent record.

1228
01:22:30,357 --> 01:22:32,690
You might as well tell them,
Mr. Schneebly.

1229
01:22:32,894 --> 01:22:37,921
OK, look. l've gotten to know your kids
the past few weeks. They're awesome.

1230
01:22:38,133 --> 01:22:42,364
Zack is an insane guitarist.
He's the next Hendrix, and he's 1 0.

1231
01:22:42,570 --> 01:22:44,697
And Gordon here, he's a genius!

1232
01:22:44,906 --> 01:22:49,435
He did a whole professional light show
on his computer in three days. And...

1233
01:22:50,345 --> 01:22:52,644
And Marta here, she's...

1234
01:22:52,848 --> 01:22:55,613
She can hit an A above high C.
Did you know that?

1235
01:22:55,819 --> 01:22:59,255
Because that's tough.
Not many singers can do that. And...

1236
01:23:02,025 --> 01:23:06,257
Summer is gonna be the first woman
president of the United States.

1237
01:23:06,463 --> 01:23:09,091
She could run this year.
l would vote for her.

1238
01:23:09,299 --> 01:23:14,100
Look, they're just really cool kids.
lf they were mine, l would be so proud.

1239
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:18,298
And l am proud,
just to even know them. And...

1240
01:23:18,743 --> 01:23:21,473
Sir, can l see you in the hall
for a moment?

1241
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:24,310
Let me just say
a couple more things.

1242
01:23:24,516 --> 01:23:26,848
- What's going on?
- What's happening?

1243
01:23:27,052 --> 01:23:29,987
Apparently, that man
is not Ned Schneebly.

1244
01:23:30,389 --> 01:23:32,481
- What?
- What?

1245
01:23:32,691 --> 01:23:35,785
- This man is Ned Schneebly.
- He's not even a teacher.

1246
01:23:35,994 --> 01:23:39,954
- You called the cops?
- She did. She got it out of me. Sorry.

1247
01:23:40,166 --> 01:23:43,658
- You're apologizing to him?
- Sorry.

1248
01:23:45,238 --> 01:23:46,865
Ned.

1249
01:23:48,409 --> 01:23:50,809
Ned, is this true?

1250
01:23:51,779 --> 01:23:53,041
Who are you?

1251
01:23:54,983 --> 01:23:57,315
My name is Dewey Finn.

1252
01:23:57,519 --> 01:24:02,888
And, no, l'm not a licensed teacher,
but l have been touched by your kids.

1253
01:24:03,090 --> 01:24:05,753
And l'm pretty sure l've touched them.

1254
01:24:12,768 --> 01:24:14,497
- What?
- Oh, my God.

1255
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:33,612
- l have nothing to say to you.
- Me either.

1256
01:24:34,992 --> 01:24:37,587
OK. l'm going to bed.

1257
01:24:37,829 --> 01:24:39,990
lt's one thing to throw
your life away,

1258
01:24:40,198 --> 01:24:42,690
but to put Ned in jeopardy
is selfish.

1259
01:24:42,902 --> 01:24:45,336
You told me to be like Ned
and get a job.

1260
01:24:45,538 --> 01:24:48,974
l told you to be like Ned,
l didn't tell you to be Ned.

1261
01:24:49,174 --> 01:24:53,007
- You're not gonna apologize?
- You apologize for calling the cops.

1262
01:24:53,211 --> 01:24:56,306
l didn't murder anybody.
l wanted to play a great show.

1263
01:24:56,515 --> 01:24:59,952
- l was this close.
- Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

1264
01:25:00,153 --> 01:25:03,816
Would you both just cut it out
for one second?

1265
01:25:10,598 --> 01:25:13,864
Look, l'm sorry, dude.
l was desperate.

1266
01:25:14,468 --> 01:25:16,902
lt was easy for you to give up music.

1267
01:25:17,104 --> 01:25:20,630
- lt ain't easy for me.
- lt wasn't easy for me.

1268
01:25:20,874 --> 01:25:22,240
l miss it.

1269
01:25:22,443 --> 01:25:24,536
Well, then why'd you give it up?

1270
01:25:24,745 --> 01:25:27,578
Because l couldn't keep
kidding myself anymore.

1271
01:25:27,782 --> 01:25:30,752
You can blame it all on bad luck,
but in the end,

1272
01:25:30,953 --> 01:25:33,320
maybe we just weren't that good.

1273
01:25:33,989 --> 01:25:36,356
Sometimes you gotta know
when to quit.

1274
01:25:36,793 --> 01:25:39,558
- Right, maybe l suck.
- That's not what l said.

1275
01:25:39,763 --> 01:25:43,596
Well, music is my life, man.
What do you want me to do?

1276
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:47,697
l don't know, but...

1277
01:25:47,905 --> 01:25:50,271
...l think it's time you moved out.

1278
01:25:51,508 --> 01:25:53,032
Sorry.

1279
01:26:01,686 --> 01:26:06,783
- So his name wasn't Mr. Schneebly?
- No, it was, like, Dewey something.

1280
01:26:07,793 --> 01:26:09,259
What about the project?

1281
01:26:09,461 --> 01:26:11,862
Wake up, Marco,
there was no project.

1282
01:26:12,064 --> 01:26:15,124
He wanted us to play a show
so we could make money.

1283
01:26:15,334 --> 01:26:17,529
l can't believe we weren't graded.

1284
01:26:17,737 --> 01:26:20,605
Why are you bummed?
We had a three-week vacation.

1285
01:26:20,974 --> 01:26:24,000
lt was a waste of time,
but it was better than school.

1286
01:26:24,211 --> 01:26:28,341
- lt was not a waste of time.
- Yeah, that's what it was.

1287
01:26:28,548 --> 01:26:30,209
- You're an idiot.
- Shut up.

1288
01:26:30,417 --> 01:26:32,510
- No, you shut up.
- You want to go?

1289
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:35,654
Touch him, l'll shove those sticks
down your throat.

1290
01:26:35,856 --> 01:26:40,556
Mr. S was cool. We worked too long
and too hard not to play the show.

1291
01:26:40,995 --> 01:26:43,020
OK, so what are
we supposed to do?

1292
01:26:43,231 --> 01:26:45,597
We get out of here
and play the damn show.

1293
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:48,998
How could you let our kids
be exposed to this impostor?

1294
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:53,369
- Do you just let anyone teach here?
- l pay $1 5,000...

1295
01:26:53,576 --> 01:26:57,876
Let me assure you that nothing
is more important to us

1296
01:26:58,081 --> 01:27:02,210
than for you to feel your children
are in a safe and secure environment.

1297
01:27:14,899 --> 01:27:17,528
- OK, we're all here.
- Where's Mr. Schneebly?

1298
01:27:17,736 --> 01:27:21,228
He didn't tell you? He's at home.
We need to pick him up.

1299
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:22,998
Let's go, hurry.

1300
01:27:29,147 --> 01:27:33,709
Excuse me.
Just one second, please.

1301
01:27:33,919 --> 01:27:36,854
- Excuse me.
- Wait a minute. Where are you going?

1302
01:27:37,056 --> 01:27:41,789
- We want some answers, now!
- Just one second!

1303
01:27:56,978 --> 01:28:01,938
Where did they go?
Help! Children?

1304
01:28:04,451 --> 01:28:06,044
Wake up.

1305
01:28:14,130 --> 01:28:18,066
- How'd you guys get in here?
- Front door was open.

1306
01:28:19,002 --> 01:28:20,593
Why aren't you in school?

1307
01:28:20,803 --> 01:28:23,329
We did what you said.
We stuck it to The Man.

1308
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:26,907
Forget about what l told you.
Look, l'm a loser, OK?

1309
01:28:27,144 --> 01:28:30,944
You listen to my advice,
you'll end up like me, with nothing.

1310
01:28:31,516 --> 01:28:34,952
Come on, man, quit goofing around.
This is serious business.

1311
01:28:35,153 --> 01:28:38,316
We're on a mission. One great show
can change the world.

1312
01:28:41,192 --> 01:28:43,127
Look out the window.

1313
01:28:50,234 --> 01:28:53,636
- Mr. S! Come down!
- Come on!

1314
01:28:53,839 --> 01:28:58,140
No way. That is so punk rock.

1315
01:29:01,247 --> 01:29:05,480
The dining-room table seats 1 4,
with no inserts...

1316
01:29:11,358 --> 01:29:15,488
- What's going on?
- We've got some rocking to do.

1317
01:29:27,542 --> 01:29:29,271
- Yes!
- All right.

1318
01:29:29,477 --> 01:29:32,470
- Hi, Mr. Schneebly.
- How's it going?

1319
01:29:34,517 --> 01:29:39,716
You guys, all l can say is,
let's rock.

1320
01:29:41,924 --> 01:29:47,191
One more thing.
l want to say l'm sorry...

1321
01:29:47,396 --> 01:29:49,660
...that l used you guys.

1322
01:29:51,768 --> 01:29:53,702
l'm sorry l lied.

1323
01:29:53,971 --> 01:29:56,600
- lt's not cool to lie to your band.
- Come on.

1324
01:29:56,808 --> 01:29:59,902
We'll be late. There's no time
for apologies. Let's go!

1325
01:30:00,111 --> 01:30:01,670
All right. Let's go.

1326
01:30:02,814 --> 01:30:05,476
- Where are you going?
- l'm going to the show.

1327
01:30:05,683 --> 01:30:07,914
- You want to go?
- Yeah, l want to go.

1328
01:30:08,120 --> 01:30:11,089
- You're serious?
- l don't want to miss this, Patty.

1329
01:30:11,290 --> 01:30:14,384
Unbelievable. After everything
he's done to you?

1330
01:30:14,593 --> 01:30:18,154
That is so typical Ned. When will you
stop being a pushover?

1331
01:30:18,364 --> 01:30:21,891
When are you finally gonna start
sticking up for yourself?

1332
01:30:26,940 --> 01:30:28,669
Excuse me.

1333
01:30:29,911 --> 01:30:32,208
Excuse me.

1334
01:30:32,412 --> 01:30:37,146
l've just been informed
that all of your children are missing.

1335
01:30:37,752 --> 01:30:40,278
- So...
- What?

1336
01:31:00,876 --> 01:31:02,401
- Hey.
- Can l help you?

1337
01:31:02,612 --> 01:31:04,944
We're competing.
We're the School of Rock.

1338
01:31:05,148 --> 01:31:07,742
- You and the kids?
- We're the band and crew.

1339
01:31:07,951 --> 01:31:10,045
- You'd better get in here.
- Come on.

1340
01:31:10,254 --> 01:31:12,722
- We're here.
- You're late. You're up next.

1341
01:31:12,924 --> 01:31:16,416
- OK, we'll be ready. Come on.
- Zack, check this out.

1342
01:31:16,628 --> 01:31:22,157
- Whoa, it's awesome.
<i>- Tears l can find on my own</i>

1343
01:31:23,801 --> 01:31:28,398
<i>l'll take you there</i>

1344
01:31:28,606 --> 01:31:30,506
<i>l'll never...</i>

1345
01:31:30,809 --> 01:31:35,372
Don't listen to those hacks. Come on.
Band meeting. Now. Gather round.

1346
01:31:35,581 --> 01:31:38,345
All right. Frankie, how's security?

1347
01:31:38,551 --> 01:31:40,576
- We're set.
- What about the lights?

1348
01:31:40,786 --> 01:31:43,348
Light board's up in the balcony.
l'll patch it up.

1349
01:31:43,557 --> 01:31:45,149
Billy, how's beautification?

1350
01:31:45,359 --> 01:31:48,090
- Are you kidding?
- OK, listen up, you guys,

1351
01:31:48,296 --> 01:31:51,628
we only have one song to let
these guys know who we are.

1352
01:31:51,832 --> 01:31:54,801
- So l think we should play Zack's.
- But why?

1353
01:31:55,002 --> 01:31:57,163
- l mean, really?
- Yes.

1354
01:31:57,471 --> 01:31:59,871
The thing is, you guys,
l ain't that good.

1355
01:32:00,073 --> 01:32:04,033
l'm not. l can admit it. But you're 1 0,
and you're better than me.

1356
01:32:04,245 --> 01:32:06,770
Your song rocks harder,
so let's play it.

1357
01:32:06,981 --> 01:32:09,746
But you know what?
That's just one guy's opinion.

1358
01:32:09,952 --> 01:32:13,080
This ain't my band, it's our band.
We all have a say.

1359
01:32:13,288 --> 01:32:17,224
We haven't practiced that one
as much. l mean, we might not win.

1360
01:32:17,426 --> 01:32:21,557
Hey, we didn't come here to win.
We came here to play one great show.

1361
01:32:21,765 --> 01:32:24,893
And on Zack's song,
you guys really rock.

1362
01:32:25,702 --> 01:32:28,671
You know my vote,
who else is with me?

1363
01:32:29,072 --> 01:32:31,063
All right, let's pray.

1364
01:32:31,275 --> 01:32:36,178
God of rock, thank you
for this chance to kick ass.

1365
01:32:36,380 --> 01:32:39,543
We are your humble servants.
Please give us the power

1366
01:32:39,750 --> 01:32:42,378
to blow minds with
our high-voltage rock.

1367
01:32:42,586 --> 01:32:45,953
- ln your name, we pray. Amen.
- Amen.

1368
01:32:46,157 --> 01:32:48,753
Now let's get out there
and melt some faces!

1369
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:51,122
- Yeah!
- Go get ready.

1370
01:32:51,330 --> 01:32:54,527
- You gotta sing it.
- Are you sure? lt's your song.

1371
01:32:54,867 --> 01:32:58,098
- Yeah, it's cool, l'm no singer.
- OK, l'll sing it.

1372
01:32:58,538 --> 01:33:00,403
- Yeah?
- What about the lights?

1373
01:33:00,606 --> 01:33:02,631
All the cues are to the other song.

1374
01:33:02,842 --> 01:33:06,279
You're just gonna have to feel it.
You gotta improvise.

1375
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:09,642
You know this song,
l know you can do it.

1376
01:33:10,049 --> 01:33:12,483
- OK.
- Go. Run like the wind!

1377
01:33:12,685 --> 01:33:15,018
- Hey.
- What's this?

1378
01:33:15,222 --> 01:33:19,387
You wanted to go with the uniform,
so put it on. Quick.

1379
01:33:22,297 --> 01:33:27,895
<i>Hear my heartsick, hungry cry</i>

1380
01:33:29,538 --> 01:33:31,869
<i>l'm heartsick</i>

1381
01:33:32,073 --> 01:33:34,337
<i>So heal me</i>

1382
01:33:34,543 --> 01:33:36,875
<i>l'm heartsick</i>

1383
01:33:37,079 --> 01:33:42,574
<i>l'm hungry</i>
<i>Thought l could survive on you</i>

1384
01:33:42,785 --> 01:33:47,780
<i>Hear my heartsick, hungry cry</i>

1385
01:33:50,294 --> 01:33:51,783
- Slow down.
- My son is...

1386
01:33:51,996 --> 01:33:54,931
- Where's your ticket?
- My son's in there, he's 1 0.

1387
01:33:55,133 --> 01:33:57,829
You're not going in without a ticket.

1388
01:33:58,035 --> 01:34:01,198
- We're not here for the show.
- We have a situation.

1389
01:34:01,405 --> 01:34:04,271
l'm Rosalie Mullins.
l'm principal of Horace Green.

1390
01:34:04,474 --> 01:34:06,466
We had a field trip that went awry.

1391
01:34:06,677 --> 01:34:09,772
Some lunatic kidnapped our kids.
Our kids are in there.

1392
01:34:09,982 --> 01:34:12,917
You're breaking my heart.
There's the ticket table.

1393
01:34:13,118 --> 01:34:16,350
- Maybe we should just get tickets.
- Let's get tickets!

1394
01:34:16,723 --> 01:34:18,657
- Excuse me.
- My child's up there.

1395
01:34:18,858 --> 01:34:21,224
Excuse me, please,
our kids are in here.

1396
01:34:21,427 --> 01:34:23,861
Excuse me, please.
Excuse me.

1397
01:34:24,063 --> 01:34:25,622
- Quit pushing!
- Excuse me.

1398
01:34:25,832 --> 01:34:28,596
- Excuse me.
- Hey, stop it.

1399
01:34:31,939 --> 01:34:34,931
Hey. What's up?

1400
01:34:35,910 --> 01:34:37,137
Come on!

1401
01:34:37,343 --> 01:34:38,868
We're the School of Rock.

1402
01:34:39,079 --> 01:34:43,413
And this song was written
by our own Zack Mooneyham.

1403
01:35:20,290 --> 01:35:23,225
<i>Baby, we was making straight A's</i>

1404
01:35:24,395 --> 01:35:27,796
<i>But we were stuck in a dumb daze</i>

1405
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,800
<i>Don't take much</i>
<i>To memorize your lies</i>

1406
01:35:32,004 --> 01:35:34,336
<i>l feel like l've been hypnoticized</i>

1407
01:35:34,541 --> 01:35:38,341
<i>And then that magic man</i>
<i>He come to town</i>

1408
01:35:38,812 --> 01:35:41,280
<i>He done spun my head around</i>

1409
01:35:41,481 --> 01:35:45,075
<i>He said, ''Recess is in session</i>
<i>Two and two make five''</i>

1410
01:35:45,884 --> 01:35:48,115
<i>And now, baby, oh, l'm alive</i>

1411
01:35:48,821 --> 01:35:51,917
<i>Oh, yeah</i>
<i>l am alive</i>

1412
01:35:52,125 --> 01:35:55,891
<i>And if you wanna be</i>
<i>The teacher's pet</i>

1413
01:35:56,096 --> 01:35:59,260
<i>Well, baby, you just better forget it</i>

1414
01:35:59,834 --> 01:36:03,362
<i>Rock got no reason</i>
<i>Rock got no rhyme</i>

1415
01:36:03,572 --> 01:36:07,030
<i>You better get me</i>
<i>To school on time</i>

<i>Got good grades</i>
<i>Ain't got no soul</i>

1420
01:36:32,102 --> 01:36:35,561
<i>Raise my hand before</i>
<i>l can speak my mind</i>

1421
01:36:35,774 --> 01:36:38,241
<i>l've been biting my tongue</i>
<i>Too many times</i>

1422
01:36:38,442 --> 01:36:41,934
<i>And then that magic man</i>
<i>Took you away</i>

1423
01:36:42,147 --> 01:36:43,478
<i>Do what magic man do</i>

1424
01:36:43,682 --> 01:36:45,912
<i>- Not what magic man say</i>
