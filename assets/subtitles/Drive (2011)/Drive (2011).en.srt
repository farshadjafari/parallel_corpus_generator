00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,255
There are a hundred thousand streets

177
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,725
What are we talking about?

178
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:44,463
You are neighbors, right?
Go home.

179
00:23:44,677 --> 00:23:47,955
- No. I would feel bad.
- No, no! Do not worry.

180
00:23:47,956 --> 00:23:49,256
Would do it with pleasure.

181
00:23:50,074 --> 00:23:51,667
It's a good boy.

182
00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:56,395
It entered service in my
5-6 years ago,

183
00:23:56,396 --> 00:23:59,276
appeared out of nowhere
and asked me to work.

184
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:02,304
I tested to see what he knows.

185
00:24:03,364 --> 00:24:04,953
- It's incredible.
- Yes.

186
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:07,505
I hired on the spot.

187
00:24:08,551 --> 00:24:12,101
Half of normal pay
but I said nothing.

188
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,103
Come up here a little.

189
00:24:16,258 --> 00:24:19,361
And then we all operate.

190
00:24:21,535 --> 00:24:22,573
Do not tell.

191
00:24:23,637 --> 00:24:26,243
It seems that we have a problem
higher than I thought.

192
00:24:26,444 --> 00:24:29,396
You should keep the car here
few days.

193
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:33,911
I offered, in your name,
take them home on Benicio and Irene.

194
00:24:33,912 --> 00:24:35,602
Good?

195
00:24:38,129 --> 00:24:39,684
- Yes, sure.
- Good.

196
00:24:42,002 --> 00:24:45,518
I wheeled the car.

197
00:24:45,959 --> 00:24:48,608
- Okay.
- One thing you should know.

198
00:24:48,609 --> 00:24:51,034
- I put the tires.
- Can you wait five minutes?

199
00:24:51,035 --> 00:24:51,935
Yes.

200
00:25:14,914 --> 00:25:17,050
Want to show you something?

201
00:25:20,223 --> 00:25:21,181
Yes.

202
00:25:24,858 --> 00:25:26,074
All right.

203
00:27:21,564 --> 00:27:22,855
I went to bed.

204
00:27:23,944 --> 00:27:25,684
It was fun today.

205
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,703
So do I.

206
00:27:42,376 --> 00:27:45,538
Sorry if I took you by surprise
When I came to service.

207
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:46,539
It's nothing.

208
00:28:10,644 --> 00:28:12,764
I am free on weekends.

209
00:28:17,394 --> 00:28:19,394
If you want to take a walk.

210
00:29:54,177 --> 00:29:56,336
Do not worry about scratches.

211
00:29:56,337 --> 00:29:58,691
E glass fiber
be replaced very easily.

212
00:29:59,537 --> 00:30:02,081
Put some paint on it
and some names of sponsors ...

213
00:30:02,082 --> 00:30:05,468
Tires are not worn.
We keep well!

214
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:12,205
- You gave 300 000 for this junk?
- I paid my money.

215
00:30:12,731 --> 00:30:16,871
That's just the hood.
Inside matter, not outside.

216
00:30:16,872 --> 00:30:18,464
- Am I right, Shannon?
- That's right, sir.

217
00:30:18,465 --> 00:30:22,070
Bullshit! If you give something 300 000,
I want everyone to see her.

218
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:23,071
Normal.

219
00:30:24,084 --> 00:30:30,056
This is a vehicle
The gathering gave pussy shit!

220
00:30:32,393 --> 00:30:34,425
Shannon sell her car.

221
00:30:34,426 --> 00:30:37,508
I should know to find a pussy
or in a brothel.

222
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:41,680
This car will make
even you look good.

223
00:30:41,681 --> 00:30:43,421
<i> already look good, buddy. </ i>

224
00:30:43,422 --> 00:30:44,728
How's it going?

225
00:30:48,117 --> 00:30:49,795
When we first race?

226
00:30:52,096 --> 00:30:53,690
Pretty soon.

227
00:30:54,456 --> 00:30:55,994
Will you be ready?

228
00:30:57,942 --> 00:30:59,337
I hope so.

229
00:30:59,338 --> 00:31:01,441
"I hope so" ...

230
00:31:01,542 --> 00:31:04,499
Without false modesty.
We have invested much money in it.

231
00:31:06,662 --> 00:31:08,850
I told Shannon ever
how we met?

232
00:31:10,316 --> 00:31:11,572
No.

233
00:31:11,573 --> 00:31:14,909
I was the producer of films in the '80s.

234
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:18,214
Action movies with sexy scenes.

235
00:31:18,215 --> 00:31:21,965
One critic has called "European films".
It seems to me sucks.

236
00:31:22,737 --> 00:31:26,047
He gave me cars
and do all the stunts.

237
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,467
I like to have him around.

238
00:31:28,668 --> 00:31:31,050
Even if I asked too much money.

239
00:31:32,554 --> 00:31:37,170
The next business was confused
with some friends of Nino's.

240
00:31:37,171 --> 00:31:39,378
They have not agreed
that they take too much money.

241
00:31:39,693 --> 00:31:41,376
I have broken pelvis.

242
00:31:41,928 --> 00:31:44,201
I was very lucky in life.

243
00:31:45,767 --> 00:31:49,524
I say all this stuff
because it has invested heavily in you.

244
00:31:50,086 --> 00:31:51,691
Just myself.

245
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,572
If you need something,
call me.

246
00:31:55,584 --> 00:31:57,350
Now we're a team!

247
00:31:59,872 --> 00:32:02,234
I'm excited!
Let's go!

248
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:04,618
Nino!

249
00:32:20,212 --> 00:32:22,506
- He's the villain?
- Yes.

250
00:32:23,328 --> 00:32:28,267
- How do you know?
- Because ... e shark.

251
00:32:29,417 --> 00:32:33,978
- Sharks are not good?
- No. Look at him!

252
00:32:34,957 --> 00:32:36,900
Show a good boy?

253
00:32:38,997 --> 00:32:41,914
- Hello! What are you doing?
- Hello! All right.

254
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:48,215
She is Cindy.

255
00:32:50,033 --> 00:32:51,190
Hello!

256
00:33:29,932 --> 00:33:32,029
It was my husband's lawyer on the phone.

257
00:33:33,037 --> 00:33:34,996
He returns home in a week.

258
00:34:58,987 --> 00:35:02,377
I know that we celebrate,
but it's a shameful thing.

259
00:35:03,971 --> 00:35:05,347
What we do ...

260
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:10,603
And I must make it up
to many people.

261
00:35:16,493 --> 00:35:18,783
But a rare second chance comes,

262
00:35:19,458 --> 00:35:20,781
is not it?

263
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:24,496
This deserves to celebrate, right?

264
00:35:26,553 --> 00:35:31,342
I want to worship
the lady there ...

265
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:34,030
Thanks for waiting me!

266
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,882
I love you, Irene!

267
00:35:36,992 --> 00:35:38,686
Cheers!

268
00:36:52,003 --> 00:36:53,110
Hello!

269
00:36:55,158 --> 00:36:56,198
Hello!

270
00:37:03,878 --> 00:37:05,927
I apologize for the noise.

271
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,583
I was going to call the police.

272
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:15,716
I would like to have done it.

273
00:37:19,558 --> 00:37:21,042
Are becoming more difficult.

274
00:37:22,242 --> 00:37:23,743
- Hello!
- Hello!

275
00:37:29,703 --> 00:37:31,153
What are you doing?

276
00:37:31,354 --> 00:37:34,099
- Hello!
- This little told me about you.

277
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:38,225
He said that you passed on to them
and I've helped with many things.

278
00:37:39,165 --> 00:37:40,539
Yes? You helped?

279
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,360
Right?

280
00:37:43,713 --> 00:37:45,122
Right?

281
00:37:48,445 --> 00:37:51,169
Sweet of you!
Thanks!

282
00:37:51,651 --> 00:37:53,013
You're welcome.

283
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:01,022
- Drive in movies?
- Yes.

284
00:38:02,151 --> 00:38:04,241
- Can I take my garbage.
- No, I go.

285
00:38:08,371 --> 00:38:10,200
Let 's leave Mom
to talk with her boyfriend.

286
00:38:31,648 --> 00:38:33,056
Good night!

287
00:39:10,965 --> 00:39:12,542
Shannon's friend are not?

288
00:39:14,955 --> 00:39:16,660
We met last year.

289
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:21,522
We've brought in Palm Springs
me and my brother.

290
00:39:25,163 --> 00:39:26,664
We hired another driver.

291
00:39:27,144 --> 00:39:30,156
I goes to prison for 6 months
My brother was killed.

292
00:39:35,097 --> 00:39:37,719
- Planning a robbery on the honor ...
- Look at me!

293
00:39:38,253 --> 00:39:39,838
Shut up,

294
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:43,566
if not, make you swallow your teeth
and see how to shut up!

295
00:39:51,586 --> 00:39:53,280
I felt good to see you.

296
00:41:09,732 --> 00:41:11,206
Come on! It's nothing.

297
00:41:12,044 --> 00:41:13,443
Come here.

298
00:41:14,607 --> 00:41:16,027
Do not be afraid.

299
00:41:18,181 --> 00:41:19,245
Look ...

300
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:22,148
Let's not tell Mom, okay?

301
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,242
It's no secret that among boys.

302
00:41:29,135 --> 00:41:30,452
Damn it!

303
00:42:30,213 --> 00:42:32,006
Who were they?

304
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:35,752
What you gonna do?
I go to fight for me?

305
00:42:36,748 --> 00:42:38,103
Want to do the duru '?

306
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,452
Why the hell are you interested in who I am?

307
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,867
There are some who want to give a robbery for them,
and I am not going to do it.

308
00:42:59,291 --> 00:43:00,701
That is.

309
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,146
What's the robbery?

310
00:43:05,139 --> 00:43:07,524
They want to rob a pawn.

311
00:43:09,655 --> 00:43:11,037
Why?

312
00:43:11,238 --> 00:43:14,038
I owe some money
because I was protected in prison.

313
00:43:14,418 --> 00:43:15,934
Two thousand dollars.

314
00:43:17,048 --> 00:43:21,663
As I got out of prison
has made five thousand. Then, 10 000.

315
00:43:21,664 --> 00:43:24,726
20 000 ...
I do not know how tomorrow will be.

316
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:29,442
What are you going to do?

317
00:43:30,366 --> 00:43:31,975
It's a very good question.

318
00:43:35,397 --> 00:43:37,948
They said they will come
and after Benicio and Irene.

319
00:44:00,996 --> 00:44:02,219
Are you okay?

320
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,574
Want a drink?

321
00:44:09,625 --> 00:44:11,472
What you got there?

322
00:44:14,073 --> 00:44:15,676
Can I see?

323
00:44:29,051 --> 00:44:32,280
- You gave him one of those people?
- Yes.

324
00:44:33,325 --> 00:44:35,153
He told me not to lose.

325
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,844
You want to keep him and me?

326
00:44:42,258 --> 00:44:43,364
All right.

327
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:09,942
How is Benicia?

328
00:45:10,976 --> 00:45:12,261
It's good.

329
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:18,431
- A half-heartedly say?
- No.

330
00:45:21,632 --> 00:45:22,984
What do you mean?

331
00:45:26,374 --> 00:45:30,632
I saw that Standard had an accident.

332
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:32,538
Yes.

333
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,449
What happened?

334
00:45:41,574 --> 00:45:43,344
He was beaten.

335
00:45:47,318 --> 00:45:48,709
Why?

336
00:45:50,253 --> 00:45:51,773
They were drunk kid.

337
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,467
Should be passed on to us.

338
00:46:08,408 --> 00:46:10,247
Let's come over him.

339
00:46:17,646 --> 00:46:19,659
Want to tell a story?

340
00:46:20,228 --> 00:46:22,183
Want to hear how we met
I am with Mommy?

341
00:46:22,248 --> 00:46:24,699
- Yes.
- Yes? All right.

342
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:28,003
I was at a party.

343
00:46:28,815 --> 00:46:31,869
- It was 19 years.
- 17.

344
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:33,226
- It was 17 years.
- Yes.

345
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:35,994
- So it was illegal.
- Yes.

346
00:46:39,524 --> 00:46:43,586
I approached it illegal
face of 17 years.

347
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,278
I went to it and I said:

348
00:46:45,685 --> 00:46:49,291
Beautiful, your name?

349
00:46:49,949 --> 00:46:52,698
She said nothing.
Then I said:

350
00:46:53,113 --> 00:46:55,815
Standard me call me Gabriel.

351
00:46:56,734 --> 00:46:58,475
And what did you say?

352
00:47:03,081 --> 00:47:05,013
I said ...

353
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:08,353
Where is the luxury version?

354
00:47:13,511 --> 00:47:15,460
It's very good!

355
00:47:16,131 --> 00:47:17,630
Clever.

356
00:47:18,417 --> 00:47:20,277
Lord! I have killed.

357
00:47:23,747 --> 00:47:25,962
Then, after a year
you came along, buddy.

358
00:47:32,523 --> 00:47:34,591
The best thing in my life.

359
00:48:16,991 --> 00:48:19,200
If I run to you
to get your money

360
00:48:19,386 --> 00:48:20,486
as collateral

361
00:48:21,569 --> 00:48:25,117
tell me where you start, where to go
and where we go after the robbery.

362
00:48:25,118 --> 00:48:27,263
I give you a window of 5 minutes,
from the moment we get there.

363
00:48:27,948 --> 00:48:31,039
Whatever happens in 5 minutes
I you are available.

364
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:34,234
Whatever happens one minute
over five, you're on your own.

365
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,268
Do not take when you break six,
not your car gun

366
00:48:38,742 --> 00:48:40,253
I just run.

367
00:48:41,066 --> 00:48:43,420
It seems difficult to work with you.

368
00:48:44,172 --> 00:48:46,174
Not if we understand.

369
00:48:47,074 --> 00:48:50,452
- What's to understand?
- I can not do it alone.

370
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:52,459
One of Blanche.

371
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:53,737
Come on, brother.

372
00:48:55,375 --> 00:48:57,921
It's beautiful, look at it.

373
00:49:00,158 --> 00:49:02,023
Why give your eyes?

374
00:49:04,286 --> 00:49:06,620
Get the hell out of here!
Stand up!

375
00:49:06,621 --> 00:49:09,046
Standard, take it with you.
Go and get him a Coke.

376
00:49:16,435 --> 00:49:18,007
Tell you what.

377
00:49:20,177 --> 00:49:21,972
As for Blanche,

378
00:49:23,459 --> 00:49:26,617
both goddamn,
minus what I owe,

379
00:49:28,174 --> 00:49:30,977
and as for you.

380
00:49:33,181 --> 00:49:35,822
<i> Go fuck </ i>
Are you interested?

381
00:49:38,009 --> 00:49:39,196
Good.

382
00:49:39,497 --> 00:49:40,597
Anything else?

383
00:49:41,663 --> 00:49:44,847
When do you get your money,
His duty will be paid.

384
00:49:45,553 --> 00:49:47,223
He finished with everything!

385
00:49:47,224 --> 00:49:49,868
No one nearest you
his family again.

386
00:49:50,807 --> 00:49:52,135
Do you understand?

387
00:49:56,881 --> 00:50:00,324
I'm here with my family
and my new friend.

388
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:02,697
And ...

389
00:50:04,088 --> 00:50:06,120
To worship for the future!

390
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,729
Our future.

391
00:50:34,101 --> 00:50:35,970
See you in 5 minutes.

392
00:50:42,462 --> 00:50:43,900
See you in April.

393
00:55:23,124 --> 00:55:25,532
As you said that right?

394
00:55:28,837 --> 00:55:30,586
40 000.

395
00:55:38,865 --> 00:55:40,214
Stay here!

396
00:55:59,809 --> 00:56:01,823
When you saw last time
Your husband?

397
00:56:05,446 --> 00:56:07,682
You can answer the question?

398
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:20,464
<i> - Hello </ i>
- Benicio? You?

399
00:56:20,665 --> 00:56:21,665
<i> Yes. </ i>

400
00:56:21,966 --> 00:56:25,008
- Hello!
<i> - Hello ...</ i>

401
00:56:25,009 --> 00:56:26,500
Your mother home?

402
00:56:27,283 --> 00:56:31,292
<i> sit
and talking to police. </ i>

403
00:56:32,303 --> 00:56:34,943
Tell him that it more sun and, okay?

404
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:37,200
All right. Pa!

405
00:56:40,136 --> 00:56:42,531
<i> has been identified
Standard as Gabriel. </ i>

406
00:56:44,476 --> 00:56:45,874
<i> Other details are unclear, </ i>

407
00:56:45,875 --> 00:56:49,298
but the owner said pawn <i>
reporters that Gabriel acted alone </ i>

408
00:56:49,299 --> 00:56:51,859
<i> and that what is stolen
was recovered. </ i>

409
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:55,217
<i> It seems that other criminals have adopted ...</ i>

410
00:57:15,646 --> 00:57:17,839
If you saw that you got money

411
00:57:19,076 --> 00:57:21,085
and you saw when you got in the car,

412
00:57:23,015 --> 00:57:25,320
then why not say anything?

413
00:57:26,952 --> 00:57:28,421
I do not know.

414
00:57:40,276 --> 00:57:42,653
Did you know there will be a second car?

415
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,910
I've already said everything I know.

416
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,612
You just killed the father of a boy.

417
00:57:59,315 --> 00:58:01,398
It was to die too.

418
00:58:02,365 --> 00:58:04,525
And now I lie.

419
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:06,577
How about that?

420
00:58:07,451 --> 00:58:08,967
From now on,

421
00:58:08,968 --> 00:58:12,487
one tell me the truth.

422
00:58:13,472 --> 00:58:16,101
If not, I'll hurt you!

423
00:58:17,121 --> 00:58:18,749
Do you understand?

424
00:58:19,852 --> 00:58:21,767
Now tell me what you said Cook.

425
00:58:23,355 --> 00:58:26,001
He said he will be a car
that we delay.

426
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:31,475
But I told her to kill him.
I said that to kill us.

427
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,511
They were going to take our money?

428
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:42,729
What is his real name?

429
00:58:43,431 --> 00:58:46,224
He says that calling him Chris.
I call it Cook.

430
00:58:50,761 --> 00:58:54,151
I will go at it right now!

431
00:58:56,422 --> 00:58:59,687
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

432
01:01:54,266 --> 01:01:57,591
- Slowly.
- It's better.

433
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:13,596
What did you do with money?

434
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:19,170
- I could safely put them ...
- Leave ...

435
01:02:25,976 --> 01:02:28,784
This guy, Cook ...
Also has a real name?

436
01:02:29,805 --> 01:02:31,010
Of course.

437
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:39,649
I'll ask him Bernie.
Maybe he knows.

438
01:02:41,706 --> 01:02:46,303
Lord! I keep thinking
what I have done with that money!

439
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:47,617
- Stop it.
- Welcome!

440
01:02:48,128 --> 01:02:50,448
Many men confuse
with married women,

441
01:02:50,449 --> 01:02:52,881
but you are only
that would rob a pawn

442
01:02:52,882 --> 01:02:55,921
the husband to pay the debt.
You're crazy!

443
01:02:56,712 --> 01:02:59,591
Do not worry. A fix it.

444
01:03:31,279 --> 01:03:33,971
- Where's Cook?
- It's in the locker room.

445
01:03:35,324 --> 01:03:36,512
And where is that?

446
01:03:37,425 --> 01:03:38,824
It's there.

447
01:03:59,086 --> 01:04:02,546
Motherfucker! You're a dead man!

448
01:04:08,908 --> 01:04:11,041
Whose money is that I am?

449
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:14,024
Do not worry,
will come after them.

450
01:04:14,801 --> 01:04:16,034
No, no!

451
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:20,426
- Call them!
- To call someone Nino!

452
01:04:31,834 --> 01:04:33,526
Remember this?

453
01:04:57,303 --> 01:04:58,419
<i> Hello </ i>

454
01:04:59,751 --> 01:05:03,498
- Nino?
<i> - No. Call later. I closed. </ I>

455
01:05:03,506 --> 01:05:07,822
I call, but I think Nino would upset
that you made to wait.

456
01:05:08,674 --> 01:05:10,444
<i> May I ask what it is </ i>

457
01:05:11,688 --> 01:05:13,446
I have something that belongs.

458
01:05:14,123 --> 01:05:16,098
Namely <i> </ i>

459
01:05:16,936 --> 01:05:18,840
One million dollars.

460
01:05:19,905 --> 01:05:21,274
<i> Wait, please. </ i>

461
01:05:28,352 --> 01:05:30,959
<i> something you belong to me? </ i>

462
01:05:36,334 --> 01:05:38,204
So it seems.

463
01:05:40,446 --> 01:05:42,161
And call me ...

464
01:05:43,165 --> 01:05:44,900
Why?

465
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:50,033
- Want to buy from you what is mine?
- Do not want to sell.

466
01:05:50,776 --> 01:05:54,016
I'll tell you time and time
and you will come and you take them.

467
01:05:54,714 --> 01:05:56,356
Do you understand?

468
01:05:57,778 --> 01:05:59,736
<i> out to you what you </ i>

469
01:06:01,013 --> 01:06:02,177
Nothing.

470
01:06:02,927 --> 01:06:04,687
Get rid of this situation.

471
01:06:05,818 --> 01:06:08,229
<i> and your partners what I say about it </ i>

472
01:06:09,437 --> 01:06:11,751
I have no partner.

473
01:06:12,745 --> 01:06:16,756
Have you ever talked to someone
about it?

474
01:06:17,946 --> 01:06:19,619
<i> not only with you. </ i>

475
01:06:20,782 --> 01:06:22,886
Not very good at it, is not it?

476
01:07:16,116 --> 01:07:18,225
Can you talk a bit?

477
01:07:19,206 --> 01:07:21,178
I can not talk. I have to go.

478
01:07:24,477 --> 01:07:27,917
- Can you lead the way down?
- Yes.

479
01:07:47,962 --> 01:07:49,860
You have to tell you something.

480
01:07:56,124 --> 01:07:58,230
Standard due ...

481
01:08:00,136 --> 01:08:03,259
... Some money to guys in prison.

482
01:08:05,048 --> 01:08:08,264
They threatened your life
and if not paid by Benicio.

483
01:08:11,747 --> 01:08:13,538
I asked for help.

484
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:19,417
Something went wrong.

485
01:08:22,895 --> 01:08:24,535
Sorry.

486
01:08:29,395 --> 01:08:31,508
Money is still in me.

487
01:08:35,375 --> 01:08:37,811
I give you, if you want.

488
01:08:40,228 --> 01:08:42,009
You could get Benicio and ...

489
01:08:53,286 --> 01:08:56,609
I thought that you could
to get out of here.

490
01:08:59,990 --> 01:09:02,067
I could go with you.

491
01:09:05,804 --> 01:09:07,573
I could take care of you.

492
01:09:12,745 --> 01:09:14,419
Sorry ...

493
01:09:14,867 --> 01:09:16,485
We arrived at the wrong floor.

494
01:12:39,285 --> 01:12:41,426
They came to my apartment, Shannon.

495
01:12:42,937 --> 01:12:44,742
How do I know where I live?

496
01:12:46,909 --> 01:12:48,928
I told him he would call Bernie.

497
01:12:48,929 --> 01:12:54,076
I wanted to know that you are interested in money,
that you did it girl.

498
01:12:55,897 --> 01:12:57,347
- What did you say?
- No, no!

499
01:13:00,101 --> 01:13:02,462
- Calm down!
- You said Irene?

500
01:13:02,663 --> 01:13:04,834
Calm down, kid!

501
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:07,894
Irene said you have?

502
01:13:07,995 --> 01:13:11,112
I wanted to know ...

503
01:13:11,113 --> 01:13:13,899
... That as soon as they return the money,
everything will be over. Both!

504
01:13:14,682 --> 01:13:17,833
I did not know. How do I know
that will come?

505
01:13:17,834 --> 01:13:18,834
Well?

506
01:13:19,335 --> 01:13:21,476
Let me talk to Bernie.

507
01:13:22,496 --> 01:13:25,448
Why should spoil everything, Shannon?

508
01:13:26,854 --> 01:13:28,850
Why ruin it?

509
01:13:34,591 --> 01:13:37,385
I'll look.
I'll come after you.

510
01:13:38,105 --> 01:13:39,310
Do you understand?

511
01:13:40,494 --> 01:13:43,490
You have to go from here
as soon as possible!

512
01:13:44,466 --> 01:13:45,581
- Listen to me.
- God!

513
01:13:45,582 --> 01:13:48,592
Listen to me, Shannon!

514
01:13:49,338 --> 01:13:51,740
Go away and do not come back!

515
01:13:52,802 --> 01:13:54,637
Stop back again!

516
01:14:00,863 --> 01:14:02,819
Take care.

517
01:14:19,749 --> 01:14:21,583
I already gave my advice.

518
01:14:22,512 --> 01:14:26,766
- You have to take money and leave him in peace.
- It's not that simple, Bernie.

519
01:14:26,767 --> 01:14:29,825
No, not now that everything
has turned against you!

520
01:14:29,826 --> 01:14:32,975
We owe this guy.
Let me less and I get rid of him.

521
01:14:32,976 --> 01:14:37,180
Shut up!
Damn monkey!

522
01:14:37,971 --> 01:14:41,820
Money is of one of Philadelphia.

523
01:14:41,821 --> 01:14:45,949
I found that holding a million dollars
a pawn,

524
01:14:46,150 --> 01:14:49,752
I wanted to invest in L.A.,
make us competitive.

525
01:14:49,853 --> 01:14:52,324
You stole from mob
the East Coast?

526
01:14:52,482 --> 01:14:55,332
No. I stole from a junkie

527
01:14:55,333 --> 01:14:57,466
trying to step on us horny.

528
01:14:57,467 --> 01:15:01,433
And why not come to me before
beginners to plan this robbery?

529
01:15:02,707 --> 01:15:05,282
Before you hire him for nothing this.

530
01:15:05,283 --> 01:15:08,102
It was something minor.
I wanted to get involved.

531
01:15:08,203 --> 01:15:10,074
Now I am involved!

532
01:15:12,382 --> 01:15:14,043
Let me tell you something.

533
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:20,091
If someone is
that you stole from family,

534
01:15:20,092 --> 01:15:22,822
- Kill us both.
- The mother fucking family?

535
01:15:24,293 --> 01:15:27,155
The family still calls me a Jew?

536
01:15:28,051 --> 01:15:29,767
Straight ahead?

537
01:15:30,994 --> 01:15:33,292
I have 59 years, Bernie!

538
01:15:33,393 --> 01:15:36,035
Also take me to the cheeks,
I like small child.

539
01:15:37,801 --> 01:15:38,827
Family ...

540
01:15:38,828 --> 01:15:43,072
Money flows easily, you know.

541
01:15:45,046 --> 01:15:47,360
For this to be
to get rid of the driver, Bernie.

542
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:50,113
Shower to be!

543
01:15:50,114 --> 01:15:55,193
And your friend, Shannon.
Are the only ones who know they are involved.

544
01:16:22,685 --> 01:16:24,018
My eye!

545
01:16:35,121 --> 01:16:37,973
Now it's your turn
to collect me.

546
01:17:41,394 --> 01:17:45,502
With all these priceless machines,
I thought you had better locks.

547
01:17:49,321 --> 01:17:51,631
My door is always open to you.

548
01:17:52,286 --> 01:17:53,733
Going somewhere?

549
01:17:59,286 --> 01:18:00,784
I thought to go.

550
01:18:01,576 --> 01:18:03,496
I'm looking for the driver.

551
01:18:06,012 --> 01:18:08,637
I thought it was bad I
seeing that you have entered by force.

552
01:18:08,951 --> 01:18:11,956
It's just bad luck, Shannon.

553
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:16,434
Give 2000 a year of robberies
in this town,

554
01:18:16,535 --> 01:18:18,428
him and he just chose that one wrong.

555
01:18:19,002 --> 01:18:22,609
- He tried to make things right.
- I chose the right man here either.

556
01:18:23,451 --> 01:18:27,378
My partner is an infamous tyrant
put to the wall.

557
01:18:28,115 --> 01:18:29,822
So am I now.

558
01:18:30,898 --> 01:18:33,833
If things right,
will give the great tribulation.

559
01:18:37,143 --> 01:18:39,837
Any idea where it might be?

560
01:18:41,617 --> 01:18:43,202
In Mexico.

561
01:18:44,418 --> 01:18:47,107
Or if said Belize.

562
01:18:49,940 --> 01:18:51,570
Seriously?

563
01:18:58,112 --> 01:19:01,133
I began to enjoy
for this business.

564
01:19:01,334 --> 01:19:03,921
Put my name on a car!

565
01:19:04,713 --> 01:19:06,613
Look how beautiful is!

566
01:19:06,614 --> 01:19:09,106
I wanted to see my name on it.

567
01:19:11,378 --> 01:19:14,243
I think we could succeed
in this business.

568
01:19:29,549 --> 01:19:33,982
Do not worry. That was it.
It is over.

569
01:19:34,593 --> 01:19:36,613
Without any pain. It is over.

570
01:24:14,977 --> 01:24:16,370
What the hell was that?

571
01:24:16,871 --> 01:24:18,012
I Do Not know.

572
01:24:19,783 --> 01:24:21,129
I'm going to see.

573
01:24:49,448 --> 01:24:52,059
- It's free, right?
- Yes.

574
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:00,070
What the hell?

575
01:26:48,731 --> 01:26:52,121
Nino? Nino!?

576
01:26:53,261 --> 01:26:54,995
Who is this?

577
01:26:56,807 --> 01:26:58,566
You know who I am.

578
01:26:59,940 --> 01:27:01,440
Where is Nino?

579
01:27:03,758 --> 01:27:05,058
He went.

580
01:27:08,361 --> 01:27:10,920
I think I stretched it too much.

581
01:27:12,055 --> 01:27:14,993
Is there a reason
We should continue?

582
01:27:16,575 --> 01:27:18,529
How about we meet?

583
01:27:21,717 --> 01:27:23,568
<i> Why would I do that? </ i>

584
01:27:25,911 --> 01:27:29,460
I am with you and your girlfriend
are the only players left.

585
01:27:29,996 --> 01:27:31,785
Why you get this?

586
01:27:33,082 --> 01:27:34,433
When?

587
01:27:35,418 --> 01:27:36,922
Tomorrow <i>. </ i>

588
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:41,805
I know a place <i> Sherman Street.
A restaurant called "The Great Wall". </ I>

589
01:27:41,806 --> 01:27:44,286
<i> - You know? </ i>
- I found it.

590
01:28:11,370 --> 01:28:13,181
Can you talk a bit?

591
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:18,006
I'll keep you too much.

592
01:28:22,780 --> 01:28:25,000
I have to go somewhere.

593
01:28:26,323 --> 01:28:28,678
I do not think he'll come back.

594
01:28:32,711 --> 01:28:35,096
I just wanted to know

595
01:28:36,606 --> 01:28:40,991
that the fact that I could sit next to you
is the best thing in my life.

596
01:29:33,180 --> 01:29:34,706
You bring the money?

597
01:29:41,185 --> 01:29:43,182
Look what I can offer.

598
01:29:44,190 --> 01:29:46,448
If I give money
the girl is safe.

599
01:29:47,274 --> 01:29:50,795
Ever, no one knows it to her.
Out of sight.

600
01:29:52,478 --> 01:29:55,295
I can not give you the same.

601
01:29:56,055 --> 01:29:58,008
Here's what I suggest.

602
01:29:59,194 --> 01:30:04,705
Conclude business, we hand
and you see your life.

603
01:30:07,253 --> 01:30:11,651
Any dream you have hope
or plan for the future

604
01:30:11,852 --> 01:30:14,335
will be put on hold.

605
01:30:15,353 --> 01:30:18,743
For life,
will have to be on alert.

606
01:30:18,744 --> 01:30:22,805
I say this
because I want to know the truth.

607
01:30:24,005 --> 01:30:26,392
But the girl will be safe.

608
01:30:49,013 --> 01:30:50,619
Where is the money?

609
01:30:52,451 --> 01:30:53,954
I'm in the car.

610
01:30:58,200 --> 01:30:59,613
Let's go!
