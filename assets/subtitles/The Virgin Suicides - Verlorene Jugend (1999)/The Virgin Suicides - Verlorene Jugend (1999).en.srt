- [ liquid dripping ]
- [ siren wailing intensifes ]

00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:28,252
[ male narrator]
cecilia was the first to go.

[ monitor beeping ]

8
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,661
what are you doing here,
honey?

9
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:17,327
y ou're not even old enough to know
how bad life gets.

10
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:21,737
obviously, doctor, you've never been
a 13-year-old girl.

11
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,110
[narrator] everyone dates the demise
of our neighborhood...

12
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:02,739
from the suicides
of the lisbon girls.

13
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,750
people saw their clairvoyance
in the wiped-out elms,

14
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:11,552
the harsh sunlight and the continuing
decline ofi our auto industry.

15
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:15,185
even then, as teenagers, we tried to put
the pieces together.

16
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:17,593
we still can 't.

17
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,666
now, whenever we run into each other
at business lunches or cocktail parties,

18
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:24,294
we find ourselves in the corner
going over the evidence one more time--

19
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:29,269
all to understand
those five girls,

20
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,434
who, after all these years,
we can't get out of our minds.

21
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:36,772
cecilia, the youngest, was 13,

22
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:42,444
and Iux was 14.

23
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,724
bonnie was 15.

24
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:48,726
mary was 16,

25
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:54,157
and therese was 17.

26
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:01,231
no one could understand how mrs. Iisbon
and mr. Iisbon, our math teacher,

27
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:03,741
had produced
such beautiful creatures.

28
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:11,941
paul baldino claimed to have
found cecilia on her first attempt.

29
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:14,178
i was the one who found her.
[ exhales ]

30
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:17,779
i was in the storm sewer under my house,
and there's all these tunnels.

31
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,881
you could get
into anyone's house.

32
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,086
[ narrator] so when paul said this,
we believed him...

33
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:24,857
because he was the son
of sammy "the shark" baldino,

34
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:27,831
and we knew about his escape tunnel
that led through the sewers.

35
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:31,426
so i went up, thinking i could see
the lisbon girls taking a shower.

36
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:34,836
- right.
- then i walk in,

37
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,841
and i see blood every where.

38
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:41,277
i turned around and went straight
for the stairs and back out the tunnel.

39
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:44,646
i had to tell you guys
that story, so--

40
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,219
see you guys later,
all right.

41
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:52,122
- [ woman on phone ] it was an accident.
- [ woman ] no!

42
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:56,662
it was no accident,joan.
of  course the parents are to blame.

43
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:59,231
well, i heard they found
the razor in the toilet.

44
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:02,733
[ narrator] everyone had an opinion as
to why cecilia tried to kill herself.

45
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:06,931
that girl didn't want to die.
she just wanted out of that house.

46
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,440
she wanted out of
that decorating scheme.

47
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:18,412
[narrator] the most populartheory
held dominic palazzolo to blame.

48
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:21,078
dominic was the immigrant kid staying
with relatives until his family...

49
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:23,451
got settled in new mexico.

50
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:26,047
he was the first boy in our
neighborhood to wear sunglasses,

51
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,185
and within a week of his arrival,
he'd fallen in love.

52
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:32,321
the object of his desire
wasn 't cecilia...

53
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,332
but diana porter.

54
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:41,168
- [ sighing ]
- i love her.

55
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:45,540
when diana porter left on vacation
in switzerland, dominic denounced god,

56
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:47,545
oh, no!

57
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:52,846
and, to prove his love, he jumped of
the roof of his relatives' house.

58
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:57,386
[ mouth words ]

59
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:17,903
[ clears throat ]
i'm gonna show you some images,

60
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,377
and, uh, you tell me...

61
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:26,709
what they remind you of.

62
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,719
okay?

63
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:47,472
a banana.

64
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:55,212
a swamp.

65
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:05,956
an afro.

66
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:29,040
i don't think cecilia
truly meant to end her life.

67
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:31,844
her act was a cry for help.

68
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,317
i knowyou're very strict,

69
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:39,687
but i think that cecilia would benefit
by having a social outlet...

70
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,693
outside of the codification
of school,

71
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:47,563
where she could interact
with males her own age.

72
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,807
petersisten helped mr. Iisbon...

73
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:59,810
install a model of the solar
system in his classroom,

74
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:03,143
and in return, mr. Iisbon
invited him for dinner.

75
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,341
bless us, o lord, and these...

76
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,647
thy gifts which we are about
to receive from thy bounty,

77
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:09,687
through christ, our lord, amen.

78
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,689
amen.

79
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:15,022
- lux, please, putyour shirt on.
- sorry.

80
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:22,994
- thankyou, dear.
- can you pass the salt, please?

81
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:25,866
- ham?
- thank you.

82
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,770
- sweetheart would you like some peas?
- i hate peas.

83
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,274
yeah?

84
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:32,776
[ father]
that's a nice-looking ham, dear.

85
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,779
well, thankyou, honey.

86
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:42,616
so, peter, are you
an aviation enthusiast?

87
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:47,182
i don't know if i'd call myself
an enthusiast, but i like planes.

88
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:50,955
ah.

89
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:54,726
uh, peter, are you
on-on the football squad?

90
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:58,270
um, no, i play,
but i'm not actually on the team.

91
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:02,364
- [father] not a team player.
- do you like to wrestle?

92
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:07,037
- [ girls giggling]
- [father] you okay, peter?

93
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:12,413
the brazilian turbot frog was added
to the endangered species list today.

94
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:15,385
- that's the third animal this year.
- oh, dear!

95
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:18,082
the turbot frog, darling--
i don't think i've ever heard--

96
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,420
um, excuse me.
may i use the restroom?

97
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:23,620
oh, of course. the one down here
isn't working very well.

98
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:27,130
- go upstairs through cecilia 's room.
- okay, thanks.

99
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:38,537
- [ knocking ]
- hold-hold on.

100
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:42,005
i thought you died
in there.

101
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:46,010
y ou done hogging the bathroom?
i need something.

102
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,919
do you mind?

103
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,589
- thank you very much.
- you forgetting something?

104
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,394
peter, here's the little airfoil
i thought you might find amusing.

105
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,630
thank you.

106
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:15,036
it's, uh--
[ clears throat ]

107
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:18,304
a demonstration
of bernoulli's principle: lift--

108
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:24,214
[narrator] from that time on,
the lisbon house began to change.

109
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:30,487
- [ chain saw buzzing]
- almost every day,

110
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:33,615
and even when she wasn't
keeping an eye on cecilia,

111
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:36,092
I ux would suntan on her towel
wearing a swimsuit,

112
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:40,598
that caused the knife sharpener to give
her a 15-minute demonstration for free.

113
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,601
following the doctor's orders,
two weeks after cecilia returned home,

114
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:53,736
mr. Iisbon persuaded his wife to allow
the girls the first and only party...

115
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:55,746
of their short lives.

116
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:06,823
there. is that okay?

117
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:10,527
i gotta get dressed.

118
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:22,239
- welcome!
- good evening, mrs. Iisbon.

119
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:25,071
come on in!

120
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,172
the party's in the basement.

121
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:36,621
just go on around to the left
and then down the stairs.

okay.

134
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:11,881
do you know where
you're applying yet?

135
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:15,750
well, no, but my parents
are pushing towards yale,

136
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,824
'cause that's
where my dad went.

137
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,824
that's nice.

138
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,725
you'd have to imagine what it'd be like
when the clouds would open up...

139
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:30,632
and out of the sun would come the hun
and his messerschmitt coming down.

140
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:33,569
and boys, i swear, what--
two or three years older than you--

141
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,572
would be in this,
the p-51 -b mustang.

00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:37,574

for "bull's-eye."

the war for the united kingdom.

as though nothing had happened.

338
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:09,625
we f elt that if  we kept
looking hard enough,

339
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:13,686
we might begin to understand what they
were f eeling and who they were.

are venn diagrams as you remember--

if we have "a" and " b"
intersecting,

342
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:24,273
and "a" and " b."

343
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:27,344
ifi"a " intersects "b, "
we have this area,

344
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:30,778
and ifi"a " is
the union with "b, "

345
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:33,817
we have all of the circle
plus the intersection.

346
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:39,185
these are the laws
ofiintersection and union. okay?

when he died.

about this serious matter...

at this school.

green pamphlets were distributed.

[ woman ] we thought green was cheerful,
but not too cheerful--

361
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:55,660

362

we couldn 't help but look for.

365

pupils dilated?

in school activities,

367

368

from their peers?

so, for example, we have
two dififierent types of economics,

different types of  economics.

375
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:50,146

is called macroeconomics.

lux were always the stupidest boys...

we weren't exactly talking,
if you know what i mean.

385

[narrator] but the only reliable boy
who actually got to know lux...

386
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:31,092
was trip fontaine,

before the suicides,

the diabetic kid, took his insulin.

414

on this day, he ran into mr. woodhouse
and ducked in the nearest class.

of the turning world, man.

524
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:40,889
what... might those
intentions be?

525
00:46:42,266 --> 00:46:44,359
i want to ask lux
to the homecoming dance.

526
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:49,635

sit down for a minute?

527
00:46:54,344 --> 00:46:57,677
you see, my wife
and i have certain rules.

528
00:46:57,781 --> 00:46:59,908
they've been the same rules for the
older girls, and i can't very well...

529
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:02,645
go and change them now
for the younger ones.

even if i wanted to, the wife
wouldn't let me. [ chuckles ] true.

531
00:47:06,523 --> 00:47:08,718
so, um,

532
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:12,353
if you want to come over and watch
television again, that would be fine.

533
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:17,422
but you cannot take lux out,
especially not in a car, so--

534
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:20,128
i'm sorry, son.
that's just our policy.

535
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:26,304
okay, sir, what if--
what if it was a bunch of us guys...

00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:48,591

[ narrator]
after the suicide free-for-all,

1012
01:26:24,913 --> 01:26:28,371
mr. and mrs. Iisbon gave up any attempt
to lead a normal life.

1013
01:26:31,052 --> 01:26:33,646
they had mr. headley
pack up the house,

1014
01:26:33,755 --> 01:26:36,849
selling what furniture he could
in a garage sale.

1015
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:40,625
mr. Iisbon put the house
on the market,

1016
01:26:40,728 --> 01:26:45,688
and it was sold to a young couple
from boston.

1017
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:48,928
we, of  course, took the family photos
that were put out with the trash.

[ clock ticking ]

1019
01:26:52,473 --> 01:26:54,373
in the end, we had pieces
of the puzzle,

1020
01:26:54,475 --> 01:26:57,308
but no matter how we put them together,
gaps remained--

1021
01:26:57,412 --> 01:27:01,678
oddly shaped emptiness
mapped by what surrounded them,

1022
01:27:01,783 --> 01:27:03,978
Iike countries
we couldn 't name.

1023
01:27:07,655 --> 01:27:10,920
what lingered after them
was not life,

1024
01:27:11,025 --> 01:27:14,483
but the most trivial list
ofimundane fiacts--

1025
01:27:16,464 --> 01:27:18,796
a clock
ticking on the wall,

1026
01:27:20,568 --> 01:27:22,593
a room dim at noon,

1027
01:27:24,138 --> 01:27:28,837
the outrageousness ofi a human being
thinking only ofiherself.

1028
01:27:33,448 --> 01:27:37,009
we began the impossible process
ofitrying to forget them.

1029
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:46,223
our parents seemed
better able to do this,

1030
01:27:46,327 --> 01:27:49,296
returning to their tennis foursomes
and cocktail cruises...

1031
01:27:49,397 --> 01:27:51,991
as though they'd
seen this all before.

1032
01:27:53,868 --> 01:27:56,428
it was full-fledged
summer again,

1033
01:27:56,537 --> 01:27:59,529
over a year from the time
cecilia had slit her wrists,

1034
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:02,803
spreading the poison
in the air.

1035
01:28:02,910 --> 01:28:05,504
a spill at the plant increased
the phosphates in the lake...

1036
01:28:05,613 --> 01:28:09,777
and produced a scum of algae so thick
that the swamp smell filled the air,

1037
01:28:09,884 --> 01:28:13,411
infiltrating
the genteel mansions.

1038
01:28:13,521 --> 01:28:16,046
debutantes cried over the misfortune
ofi coming out...

1039

in a season everyone would remember
for its bad smell.

1040
01:28:20,595 --> 01:28:23,029
the o'conners, however,
came up with the ingenious solution...

1041
01:28:23,131 --> 01:28:26,294
of making the theme of their daughter
alice's debutante party...

1042
01:28:26,401 --> 01:28:29,029
asphyxiation.

1043
01:28:29,137 --> 01:28:32,834
Iike everyone else, we went to forget
about the lisbon girls.

your father built it, didn't he?

1062
01:30:33,461 --> 01:30:37,022
[narrator] so much has been said
about the girls over the years.

1063
01:30:38,499 --> 01:30:40,660
but we have never
found an answer.

1064
01:30:43,604 --> 01:30:46,266
it didn't matter in the end
how old they had been...

1065
01:30:48,476 --> 01:30:50,910
or that they were girls,

1066
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:56,077
but only that we
had loved them...

1067
01:30:56,184 --> 01:30:58,345
and that they hadn 't
heard us calling,

1068

still do not hear us calling them
out of those rooms...

where they went to be alone
for all time...

to put them back together.
