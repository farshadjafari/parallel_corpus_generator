1
00:00:27,876 --> 00:00:30,169
We're federal agents,
we are not martyrs!

2
00:00:32,422 --> 00:00:33,673
This is suicide!

3
00:00:34,383 --> 00:00:37,343
She is just one of many abductions.

4
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:39,888
Why is this abduction so special!

5
00:00:41,974 --> 00:00:43,934
Is it because she's a
witness against the Torrez?

6
00:00:44,726 --> 00:00:50,399
She is probably caught, and drugged.

7
00:00:50,524 --> 00:00:52,360
We do not have to do this!

8
00:00:52,985 --> 00:00:54,111
If not us...

9
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,614
... Who?

10
00:00:59,784 --> 00:01:00,743
I told you to stay still!

11
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:03,413
Do not try to capture the Torrez!

12
00:01:04,622 --> 00:01:05,748
Turn around now!

13
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,334
Machete, you son of a bitch!

14
00:01:08,876 --> 00:01:10,670
Listen to orders!

15
00:01:10,796 --> 00:01:15,550
You'll eventually kill us
all! Wait for reinforcements!

16
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,912
Whatever happens...

17
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:47,459
I'm with you...

18
00:01:49,253 --> 00:01:49,628
... Boss.

19
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:53,620
This is the BOSS...

20
00:02:15,363 --> 00:02:16,197
Sorry.

21
00:03:08,177 --> 00:03:08,846
Get dressed.

22
00:03:09,813 --> 00:03:12,508
It's too hot for clothes.

23
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:33,063
You saving me from Torrez?

24
00:03:33,429 --> 00:03:34,840
You've got balls!

25
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:37,917
That looks like me.

26
00:03:43,481 --> 00:03:46,251
What's this long hard thing?

27
00:03:46,252 --> 00:03:47,584
My Machete.

28
00:03:47,585 --> 00:03:48,628
Is it sharp?

29
00:03:49,548 --> 00:03:50,329
Very...

30
00:03:51,307 --> 00:03:51,969
Good...

31
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,042
I got him

32
00:04:15,264 --> 00:04:16,440
Stupid FUCK...

33
00:04:17,573 --> 00:04:21,495
I told you to stay away asshole.

34
00:04:23,455 --> 00:04:27,250
If you had listened to my orders
you would not have been caught.

35
00:04:28,576 --> 00:04:29,536
How did I do?

36
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,333
Excellent my love.

37
00:04:32,929 --> 00:04:34,885
Excellent...

38
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:42,266
This is what happens when
they insist to be heroes.

39
00:04:43,276 --> 00:04:45,180
Why are you so insistent?

40
00:04:46,591 --> 00:04:48,994
I own the entire force...
And not just here in Mexico.

41
00:04:50,299 --> 00:04:52,956
I own the DEA... I own the Marshals...

42
00:04:54,258 --> 00:04:56,009
Why can't I own you?

43
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,677
Why don't you take the money I
offered you to look the other way?

44
00:04:59,589 --> 00:05:00,633
What's your price?

45
00:05:03,662 --> 00:05:05,397
Maybe I should ask your wife.

46
00:05:05,912 --> 00:05:06,954
Bring her in here.

47
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:12,895
No!

48
00:05:14,908 --> 00:05:15,950
Sara!

49
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,037
Your daughter... she's
in school right now.

50
00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:22,452
No?

51
00:05:25,397 --> 00:05:26,440
I don't think so.

52
00:05:31,745 --> 00:05:34,573
The honorable way to die...
is to cut off your head.

53
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:38,852
But.

54
00:05:39,934 --> 00:05:42,483
You don't deserve to die honorably.

55
00:05:45,248 --> 00:05:46,041
Burn it!

56
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:42,208
Joining us right now
we have Franklin Jones.

57
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:46,024
Deputy Director of our local Immigration
and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office.

58
00:07:46,025 --> 00:07:47,132
Thank you and pleasure to be here.

59
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,674
What steps are you taking
to secure our borders?

60
00:07:49,675 --> 00:07:52,654
ICE is working with local law
enforcement to improve patrols...

61
00:07:52,655 --> 00:07:56,037
but there's over 2000 miles of
border between Mexico and the U.S.

62
00:07:56,038 --> 00:08:00,524
And over half of that is here in Texas,

63
00:08:00,525 --> 00:08:02,973
there's a whole support network.

64
00:08:02,974 --> 00:08:04,952
That not only helps illegal aliens get

65
00:08:04,953 --> 00:08:08,077
across but is helping them get
settled. Once they are here.

66
00:08:08,078 --> 00:08:10,155
We need to uncover and
dismantle this network.

67
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:14,281
It's our top priority and our most talented
ICE agents are investigating them now.

68
00:08:16,609 --> 00:08:20,472
Agent Nevada: Day 23 of
surveillance for Operation Network.

69
00:08:22,342 --> 00:08:25,636
The Operation is suspected to
be run by a woman named Loose.

70
00:08:25,637 --> 00:08:27,626
Codename: She.

71
00:08:27,627 --> 00:08:29,873
Tacos Cafe! TACOS!

72
00:08:30,382 --> 00:08:32,969
Loose operates a taco's
truck at the labour site.

73
00:08:36,258 --> 00:08:38,480
There's a interesting...

74
00:08:38,081 --> 00:08:39,124
face.

75
00:08:45,038 --> 00:08:46,095
No! That's ok.

76
00:08:46,642 --> 00:08:47,831
Thank you.

77
00:08:51,525 --> 00:08:52,567
He's not...

78
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,996
Run through database for
possible criminal background.

79
00:09:01,997 --> 00:09:04,885
Male, Hispanic, scars, tattoo's

80
00:09:06,468 --> 00:09:08,886
Don't fuck with me, I don't
fuck with you attitude.

81
00:09:11,177 --> 00:09:12,221
Hey!

82
00:07:57,899 --> 00:07:58,942
So we need to attack the
problem at it's source.

83
00:09:12,591 --> 00:09:15,820
You work today and pay me tomorrow.

84
00:09:19,005 --> 00:09:20,048
Hi, lady

85
00:09:20,098 --> 00:09:21,933
You need a gardener?

86
00:09:41,913 --> 00:09:44,039
Come on. Stand back.

87
00:09:47,168 --> 00:09:48,294
Hurry!

88
00:09:50,046 --> 00:09:52,882
We have not got. You
can not leave us here!

89
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:53,926
Move!

90
00:09:53,925 --> 00:09:55,427
She is sick.

91
00:10:07,188 --> 00:10:08,531
Roundup time!

92
00:10:11,512 --> 00:10:12,555
Look at them!

93
00:10:30,991 --> 00:10:32,034
Speak english?

94
00:10:38,258 --> 00:10:40,173
Well, I don't speak
much Mexican neither.

95
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:42,867
You know...

96
00:10:42,868 --> 00:10:44,839
You're trespassing...

97
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,354
on my daddy's land.

98
00:10:58,154 --> 00:11:00,158
Jesus Van! Can't you
see she's been childed?

99
00:11:03,394 --> 00:11:06,223
If it gets born here.
It gets to be a citizen.

100
00:11:06,224 --> 00:11:07,947
No different than you or me.

101
00:11:09,154 --> 00:11:11,198
I know most people don't like us.

102
00:11:13,027 --> 00:11:15,092
Course... Vigilante's

103
00:11:17,502 --> 00:11:19,322
It's really about vigilance.

104
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:26,318
Somebody’s gonna watch out
for this great nation of ours.

105
00:11:25,996 --> 00:11:27,039
Otherwise...

106
00:11:28,056 --> 00:11:29,642
Texas will become...

107
00:11:29,644 --> 00:11:32,063
Mexico once again.

108
00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:37,244
Who's gonna stop it senator?

109
00:11:38,584 --> 00:11:39,738
I am.

110
00:11:43,757 --> 00:11:45,071
Welcome to America.

111
00:11:49,588 --> 00:11:50,736
You catch all that?

112
00:11:51,609 --> 00:11:53,914
Burn me a DVD. Behind our
supporters are going to like that!

113
00:11:54,394 --> 00:11:55,438
A lot.

114
00:11:57,624 --> 00:11:59,511
The infestation has begun...

115
00:11:59,512 --> 00:12:01,294
parasites have crossed our borders...

116
00:12:01,295 --> 00:12:02,952
have sickening our country...

117
00:12:02,953 --> 00:12:04,579
leeching off out system...

118
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,940
destroying us from the inside.

119
00:12:07,313 --> 00:12:08,930
But Senator John McLauglin

120
00:12:08,931 --> 00:12:10,438
has a plan of attack.

121
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:12,860
He'll fight to keep
illegal immigrants OUT!

122
00:12:47,856 --> 00:12:48,775
Hey!

123
00:12:49,262 --> 00:12:50,304
Ugly!

124
00:12:50,067 --> 00:12:51,360
Want to fight?

125
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:57,352
Don't tell me you don't wanna
earn $500 in five minutes.

126
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,558
That's my man!

127
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:04,813
Bet's! Place your bets!

128
00:13:13,514 --> 00:13:14,557
Fight!

129
00:13:59,692 --> 00:14:00,734
Thanks.

130
00:14:16,378 --> 00:14:18,535
Can I have a beans and
cheese. And a Cafe Ole.

131
00:14:19,994 --> 00:14:21,364
Ain't got no cafe Ole.

132
00:14:22,055 --> 00:14:23,098
Regular coffee then

133
00:14:30,407 --> 00:14:32,085
Oh! hold the spit please.

134
00:14:37,516 --> 00:14:39,753
Why do you pretend to
come here just for coffee?

135
00:14:40,595 --> 00:14:42,063
I'm not pretending.

136
00:14:42,064 --> 00:14:43,712
I like my coffee cheap and greasy.

137
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:46,503
I can refuse service to anyone.

138
00:14:47,819 --> 00:14:48,991
Still the American way.

139
00:14:48,992 --> 00:14:50,703
When they are citizens.

140
00:14:51,994 --> 00:14:53,124
Got your papers?

141
00:14:54,653 --> 00:14:56,233
Same as the last time you checked.

142
00:14:56,234 --> 00:14:58,339
And the time before that.

143
00:14:59,372 --> 00:15:00,507
And the time before that!

144
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:02,902
Got yours?

145
00:15:03,087 --> 00:15:05,176
Same as the last time you checked.

146
00:15:06,499 --> 00:15:07,924
You think what you do is right?

147
00:15:08,145 --> 00:15:09,680
Taking your brothers and sisters in?

148
00:15:10,544 --> 00:15:13,208
Deporting them to their
own personal health?

149
00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:14,623
It's the law.

150
00:15:14,624 --> 00:15:15,916
There are many laws.

151
00:15:16,517 --> 00:15:17,540
There sure are...

152
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,658
Immigration fraud...

153
00:15:19,659 --> 00:15:21,845
Aiding and illegal entry

154
00:15:22,585 --> 00:15:24,138
Insanitary food processing...

155
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:26,147
But you wouldn't know
anything about that would you?

156
00:15:26,655 --> 00:15:27,697
Can I get my taco's

157
00:15:33,193 --> 00:15:34,121
Who's she?

158
00:15:35,089 --> 00:15:37,035
I heard she runs an underground network.

159
00:15:37,955 --> 00:15:38,991
How the hell would I know?

160
00:15:39,322 --> 00:15:41,136
I just make tacos and I sell them.

161
00:15:41,612 --> 00:15:43,143
To the workers of this site.

162
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,237
It fills their bellies other than hate.

163
00:15:47,163 --> 00:15:48,205
Funny.

164
00:15:48,524 --> 00:15:50,209
Sounds like something she would say.

165
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,512
Catch you later.

166
00:15:58,056 --> 00:15:59,364
In the race for State Senator...

167
00:15:59,365 --> 00:16:00,592
Latest polls are showing...

168
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:03,892
a sharp decline in support for
incumbent Senator John McLaughlin.

169
00:16:03,893 --> 00:16:05,954
And his hard-line
position on immigration.

170
00:16:21,909 --> 00:16:23,256
Get in.

171
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,180
Fellow dodged it forever.

172
00:16:29,668 --> 00:16:31,409
125 perceptive.

173
00:16:32,468 --> 00:16:33,510
Sewage.

174
00:16:33,967 --> 00:16:35,307
You ever killed anyone before?

175
00:17:16,944 --> 00:17:18,019
You know this guy?

176
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,420
Senator John McLaughlin...

177
00:17:25,755 --> 00:17:27,703
Independent from cocksucker county.

178
00:17:28,294 --> 00:17:30,962
Built his reputation on being
a hardliner against wetbacks.

179
00:17:32,081 --> 00:17:33,177
Gets worse.

180
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:37,792
Yes... If he has his brothers.
He'll send you back to old Mehico.

181
00:17:37,793 --> 00:17:39,591
That's his platform.

182
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:43,703
Ship them all back before first making them
built a wall along the border for no pay.

183
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,835
Thank you very much get the fuck out.

184
00:17:46,757 --> 00:17:48,280
But what the state senator
fails to understand is...

185
00:17:48,281 --> 00:17:50,566
the state runs the illegal labour.

186
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:52,213
Thrives on it.

187
00:17:52,214 --> 00:17:54,263
Keeps costs down.

188
00:17:54,265 --> 00:17:55,307
Keeps the wheels turning.

189
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:58,676
We bust that up and we're fucked.

190
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:00,578
My words.

191
00:18:02,305 --> 00:18:04,300
Now I'm guessing you don't have papers.

192
00:18:04,948 --> 00:18:05,968
As you well know...

193
00:18:05,969 --> 00:18:07,455
illegal immigrants like yourself...

194
00:18:07,456 --> 00:18:10,172
will be forced out of the
country in alarming numbers

195
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,438
So for the sake of both our people's.

196
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,695
The senator must die.

197
00:18:30,106 --> 00:18:34,208
And for that. I will give
you 150 thousand dollars cash.

198
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:48,103
Get someone else.

199
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:51,897
No time.

200
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:54,542
This job has to happen tomorrow.

201
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:03,673
I want you to take this cash,
do the job and disappear.

202
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,030
How long would it take you
to get this kind of money?

203
00:19:08,178 --> 00:19:11,627
5... 10... 15 years?

204
00:19:12,973 --> 00:19:14,807
You can do a lot of
good things with this.

205
00:19:16,084 --> 00:19:17,429
You deserve it.

206
00:19:23,527 --> 00:19:24,786
Now I can't make you do this.

207
00:19:24,787 --> 00:19:29,019
But I can make damn sure something
happens to you if you don't.

208
00:19:30,827 --> 00:19:31,741
Are you in?

209
00:19:38,018 --> 00:19:39,169
Have a look at this...

210
00:19:39,771 --> 00:19:42,560
Straight line design,

211
00:19:40,815 --> 00:19:41,858
Laser designated scope.

212
00:19:44,098 --> 00:19:47,449
You can shoot the pecker off
a mosquito at a thousand yards.

213
00:19:48,933 --> 00:19:50,503
And keep the balls unruffled.

214
00:19:55,423 --> 00:19:55,861
Machete?

215
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,898
That's only good if you
wanna make a brutal point.

216
00:19:57,899 --> 00:20:00,809
But it's low tech. Completely
unsuited to our purposes.

217
00:20:01,111 --> 00:20:02,140
Backup...

218
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:04,149
Here's your backup.

219
00:20:04,638 --> 00:20:05,682
Me.

220
00:20:05,683 --> 00:20:07,408
You call or text if
you have any problems,

221
00:20:07,409 --> 00:20:10,112
or delays. You need to be
on that roof by 1 pm sharp.

222
00:20:17,155 --> 00:20:19,309
Now put a bullet in
the senator by 1:04pm.

223
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:13,442
Get up!

224
00:21:14,951 --> 00:21:15,994
God damn April.

225
00:21:15,995 --> 00:21:18,782
My business partner have very
little tolerance for bullshit.

226
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,634
This is a second operation
in the last six months,

227
00:21:26,635 --> 00:21:28,567
that I have to close down
because of your mentally...

228
00:21:31,251 --> 00:21:32,291
I told you a thousand times.

229
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:34,617
You need something you
come to me directly.

230
00:21:37,985 --> 00:21:39,680
You do not go to these labs.

231
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:52,060
You got something to say to me?

232
00:21:55,477 --> 00:21:56,648
Sorry daddy.

233
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,104
What's this?

234
00:22:30,105 --> 00:22:31,577
$150 thousand

235
00:22:31,578 --> 00:22:32,620
Cash.

236
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,314
Are you out of your mind?

237
00:22:36,141 --> 00:22:37,718
The Network got me across once.

238
00:22:38,644 --> 00:22:39,734
Use this.

239
00:22:40,175 --> 00:22:41,613
For the people you help.

240
00:22:41,614 --> 00:22:43,926
I don't know how you know what you know.

241
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:46,816
But I'm glad I know you.

242
00:22:51,604 --> 00:22:52,720
What'd you want?

243
00:22:54,438 --> 00:22:55,481
Here.

244
00:22:56,647 --> 00:23:00,522
Ladies and Gentlemen. Mr.
Senator John McLaughlin.

245
00:23:04,572 --> 00:23:06,544
I want to thank you all
for coming out today!

246
00:23:07,505 --> 00:23:10,199
And I want to thank this forum
from the bottom of my heart.

247
00:23:15,488 --> 00:23:16,929
Because we have been tested.

248
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:19,008
Tested by fire!

249
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:23,234
Our borders have been put to the test. And
let me tell you we have failed that test.

250
00:23:24,765 --> 00:23:27,362
The aliens,  the
infiltrators, the outsiders...

251
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,025
They come right across by light of day,

252
00:23:29,026 --> 00:23:30,079
by dark at night.

253
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,983
They'll bleed us. They'll parasites.

254
00:23:31,984 --> 00:23:33,987
They'll bleed us til we're a city,

255
00:23:33,521 --> 00:23:34,565
a county, a state.

256
00:23:35,639 --> 00:23:37,675
a nation til we're all bled out.

257
00:23:39,464 --> 00:23:40,928
Now make no mistake we are at war.

258
00:23:41,531 --> 00:23:44,028
Every time an illegal
dances across our border.

259
00:23:44,029 --> 00:23:47,124
It is an act of aggression
against this sovereign state.

260
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,842
A covert act of terrorism.

261
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:52,614
Everywhere I go in this glorious state.

262
00:23:52,615 --> 00:23:53,595
People are talking about change.

263
00:23:53,596 --> 00:23:54,963
I say why change?

264
00:23:54,965 --> 00:23:58,705
This is a great state founded
on the principles of liberty.

265
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,287
I don't want to change that.

266
00:24:02,514 --> 00:24:04,867
Our rightful citizens are
a hardworking Americans,

267
00:24:04,868 --> 00:24:06,298
who have earned their paychecks...

268
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:08,504
by the grit of their gut
and the sweat of their brow!

269
00:24:10,442 --> 00:24:11,775
I don't want to change that!

270
00:24:12,939 --> 00:24:14,317
Change! That they want change!

271
00:24:14,318 --> 00:24:15,546
Change the law!

272
00:24:15,853 --> 00:24:16,493
Open the doors!

273
00:24:16,494 --> 00:24:18,276
Red rover! Red rover!

274
00:24:18,277 --> 00:24:19,935
Let the terrorist come over!

275
00:24:21,448 --> 00:24:23,458
Let me tell you what
change that will bring!

276
00:24:24,345 --> 00:24:25,675
68 cents!

277
00:24:26,782 --> 00:24:28,484
The jingle jangle of the
pennies in your pocket.

278
00:24:28,485 --> 00:24:31,657
Because the scavengers,
the leeches, the parasites,

279
00:24:31,658 --> 00:24:33,266
are walking away with your money.

280
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:36,830
While you're left with the change.

281
00:24:38,675 --> 00:24:40,537
So I wanna say one more thing.

282
00:24:41,523 --> 00:24:42,695
Who you gonna vote for?

283
00:24:59,406 --> 00:25:00,320
There!

284
00:25:00,321 --> 00:25:02,325
Up there! I saw someone
shot from up there!

285
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:05,553
Get him to Fort Briggs!

286
00:25:13,501 --> 00:25:14,544
Roger! I'm on my way.

287
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,032
Go ahead.

288
00:25:32,109 --> 00:25:33,152
Shoot him Nacho.

289
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:34,424
Cos right after that.

290
00:25:35,692 --> 00:25:36,735
The three of us

291
00:25:37,272 --> 00:25:38,314
Are gonna shoot one of you.

292
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:46,629
Shit!

293
00:25:57,707 --> 00:25:58,749
Try it.

294
00:25:59,441 --> 00:26:00,485
Go ahead... Pacho.

295
00:26:01,639 --> 00:26:04,356
I'll grease your chips all
over this fucking alley.

296
00:26:10,673 --> 00:26:11,986
This is fucking big.

297
00:26:12,459 --> 00:26:14,185
This guy took a shot
at a representative.

298
00:26:14,186 --> 00:26:15,228
No! A Senator.

299
00:26:15,229 --> 00:26:16,308
This is fucking high.

300
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:18,347
The guy can die and we caught him.

301
00:26:18,348 --> 00:26:19,391
Hell we did!

302
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:22,687
And they'll gonna hang
your ass like Saddam!

303
00:26:23,178 --> 00:26:25,224
Look I'm gonna call the
boss unless you wanna do it.

304
00:26:25,624 --> 00:26:26,648
Yeah, you go ahead.

305
00:26:26,649 --> 00:26:29,487
We got the Mexican bird
that fell off the rooftop!

306
00:26:31,074 --> 00:26:32,493
Bring him to the basement.

307
00:26:35,081 --> 00:26:36,594
He stills thinks we're cops.

308
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,394
Well of course he will think that.

309
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,135
We frisked him, we cuffed
him, we throw him in the car.

310
00:26:41,136 --> 00:26:44,119
Apprehended him just
like the real cops do.

311
00:26:46,381 --> 00:26:48,834
I didn't frisked him.

312
00:26:48,329 --> 00:26:49,187
Yes, you did.

313
00:26:49,364 --> 00:26:50,407
Man, I'm telling you I didn’t...

314
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,583
Oh! Sweet Jesus.

315
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:02,885
Oh! DAMN!

316
00:27:13,035 --> 00:27:14,078
Shocking news this hour.

317
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:18,521
Senator John McLaughlin was shot in the
leg this afternoon by an unknown gunman.

318
00:27:19,062 --> 00:27:21,375
The Senator was immediately
driven to Parklane hospital,

319
00:27:21,376 --> 00:27:24,284
where he was reportedly in
good and stable condition.

320
00:27:24,285 --> 00:27:28,748
Video taken at the rally indicate the
gunman may have been of Mexican descent.

321
00:27:30,028 --> 00:27:32,567
Senator McLaughlin have been
very vocal against immigration.

322
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:35,048
And campaigns for
stricter border patrols.

323
00:27:51,196 --> 00:27:52,238
Boss.

324
00:27:52,569 --> 00:27:53,612
Video.

325
00:27:56,368 --> 00:27:57,988
You see what I am
sending you Mr. Torrez.

326
00:27:57,989 --> 00:28:00,279
It's coming on my screen now.

327
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,274
That's campaign gold.

328
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,538
I put my contributions were
for the Senator's re-election.

329
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,582
Not his retirement.

330
00:28:08,583 --> 00:28:10,984
McLaughlin is in a guaranteed win.

331
00:28:10,985 --> 00:28:12,861
And in a new session as promised,

332
00:28:12,862 --> 00:28:15,473
he'll ramrod through
everything we asked for.

333
00:28:16,017 --> 00:28:17,059
Pause!

334
00:28:17,506 --> 00:28:18,550
Go back.

335
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,613
Who's this?

336
00:28:22,614 --> 00:28:23,657
Nobody.

337
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,497
A day labourer from the streets.

338
00:28:25,498 --> 00:28:26,582
He won't be missed.

339
00:28:27,495 --> 00:28:28,239
Is he dead?

340
00:28:29,032 --> 00:28:31,102
Dead or dying on a rooftop.
That's what you mean.

341
00:28:31,103 --> 00:28:32,761
What the fuck is it! Asshole...

342
00:28:33,194 --> 00:28:35,086
Dead or dying?

343
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,056
He'll be dead within
minutes. I guarantee.

344
00:28:40,377 --> 00:28:42,181
For your sake.

345
00:28:46,506 --> 00:28:47,549
What?

346
00:28:49,341 --> 00:28:52,355
It's me. It's done. I think he's toast.

347
00:28:52,966 --> 00:28:54,792
Don't think! Verify! Check the morgue,

348
00:28:54,793 --> 00:28:56,685
check the hospitals, check everywhere.

349
00:29:00,748 --> 00:29:03,917
Most do not give illegals
standard treatment in hospitals.

350
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:05,711
But thou art with us.

351
00:29:05,795 --> 00:29:08,131
Nobody knows you're here.

352
00:29:08,173 --> 00:29:11,567
You were brought here
under the name John Doe,

353
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:14,080
as a mere spectator.

354
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:17,551
Is that him? Yes.

355
00:29:17,553 --> 00:29:19,402
Dr. Felix wants to see him.

356
00:29:20,293 --> 00:29:21,066
Quietly...

357
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,513
Did you see where the bullet rebound.

358
00:29:24,514 --> 00:29:27,160
It was stopped by another bullet
that was fused and lodged there.

359
00:29:27,161 --> 00:29:29,556
If he hadn't been shot
before. He'll be dead now.

360
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:32,025
There's actually a lesson
in there somewhere .

361
00:29:32,879 --> 00:29:34,696
I can feel your eyeballs on my uterus.

362
00:29:34,697 --> 00:29:36,673
Woah, woah, woah, at least
it's not on your colon.

363
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:38,429
Well, actually did you know that the...

364
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:41,432
the human intestines is ten times
longer than the length of the body?

365
00:29:41,433 --> 00:29:42,475
Wait!

366
00:29:42,476 --> 00:29:44,577
So the human intestines is 60 feet long?

367
00:29:44,578 --> 00:29:45,620
It's true.

368
00:29:47,495 --> 00:29:48,625
The hero has awoken!

369
00:29:50,418 --> 00:29:53,757
My friend! You are safe,
they are from The Network.

370
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:56,081
They will take good care of you.

371
00:29:57,255 --> 00:29:58,299
Leave him alone.

372
00:30:01,615 --> 00:30:03,140
Hello, what can I do for you?

373
00:30:03,805 --> 00:30:04,732
What can you do for me?

374
00:30:04,733 --> 00:30:07,136
I'm looking for a gentleman
that was just brought in.

375
00:30:07,137 --> 00:30:09,535
Probably into ICU.

376
00:30:10,489 --> 00:30:11,641
Where might I find him?

377
00:30:12,594 --> 00:30:14,484
You wanna go straight down
the hall, to your right...

378
00:30:15,468 --> 00:30:18,005
Make a left, two
rights and another left.

379
00:30:18,006 --> 00:30:19,040
And you'll be right there.

380
00:30:21,961 --> 00:30:22,798
You sure about that?

381
00:30:28,086 --> 00:30:29,371
I'm going this way.

382
00:30:31,958 --> 00:30:33,042
Someone is coming.

383
00:30:34,139 --> 00:30:34,955
We got trouble.

384
00:30:49,467 --> 00:30:50,686
Got another way outta here?

385
00:30:50,687 --> 00:30:51,729
No other exits.

386
00:30:52,844 --> 00:30:53,941
Oh... you don't wanna mess with that.

387
00:30:54,591 --> 00:30:55,290
That's a skull scraper.

388
00:30:55,291 --> 00:30:56,675
We use that to scrape the bones clean.

389
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,644
And those can cut through
flesh just like butter.

390
00:31:04,842 --> 00:31:05,979
Pass that tank.

391
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,584
Hold it!

392
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,597
Boss ain't gonna like this.

393
00:32:50,803 --> 00:32:51,911
What are we gonna tell him?

394
00:32:54,092 --> 00:32:54,965
Ooops.

395
00:33:22,691 --> 00:33:23,734
Evana.

396
00:33:24,376 --> 00:33:25,288
I'm on my lunch break sir.

397
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:27,079
Lunch break is over. All
hell's breaking loose,

398
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,084
Some took a shot at Senator McLaughlin.

399
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:30,388
It was a illegal.

400
00:33:30,325 --> 00:33:31,774
I'm watching it right now.

401
00:33:31,775 --> 00:33:34,126
This amateur video was taken
just outside county hospital,

402
00:33:34,127 --> 00:33:37,044
just after the failed attempt to
assassinate Senator John McLaughlin.

403
00:33:37,045 --> 00:33:39,438
Authorities believe that this
suspect is extremely dangerous...

404
00:33:39,439 --> 00:33:40,837
Son of a bitch...

405
00:33:41,585 --> 00:33:42,552
No! not you sir.

406
00:33:44,046 --> 00:33:45,155
I've seen him before.

407
00:33:46,241 --> 00:33:47,370
Yes sir. I'm on my way.

408
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,128
He maybe in this country illegally.

409
00:33:49,553 --> 00:33:53,159
And that he is of course to be considered
to be armed and extremely dangerous.

410
00:33:58,844 --> 00:34:01,697
You're all over the TV!
Cabron! Come on get inside!

411
00:34:02,309 --> 00:34:03,351
Hurry!

412
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:07,562
The shots fired on Senator
McLaughlin today maybe,

413
00:34:07,563 --> 00:34:10,603
just the shot in the
arm his campaign needed.

414
00:34:10,896 --> 00:34:13,686
New numbers indicate that he
has now taken a commanding,

415
00:34:13,687 --> 00:34:15,932
led from the wake of today's incident.

416
00:34:16,646 --> 00:34:18,135
Since today's shooting.
Others agree that

417
00:34:18,136 --> 00:34:20,636
border security should
be heavily enforced.

418
00:34:21,036 --> 00:34:24,105
Yes, hold the illegals
responsible! Close the border!

419
00:34:24,501 --> 00:34:25,747
Eh... yeah!

420
00:34:26,887 --> 00:34:29,120
Didn't you cross the
border to get here Jack?

421
00:34:29,549 --> 00:34:32,656
Well, we're almost there. If
they close the border, fine by me.

422
00:34:33,146 --> 00:34:34,354
Nocha!

423
00:34:35,014 --> 00:34:37,307
"Cona" Opinions should be like.

424
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:39,886
Waay!

425
00:34:43,386 --> 00:34:45,799
You didn't have a choice,
Of course I believe you.

426
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:48,369
why else would you give me the money?

427
00:34:49,099 --> 00:34:50,711
They'll be looking  for your ass.

428
00:34:53,677 --> 00:34:55,119
You'll be safe here.

429
00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:59,161
Try not to bleed on the bed.

430
00:35:24,002 --> 00:35:26,964
Are you "She"?

431
00:35:31,444 --> 00:35:32,949
"She" brings hope.

432
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:34,762
"She" rights the wrongs.

433
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:39,846
Unfortunately, "She's" a myth.

434
00:35:40,088 --> 00:35:42,573
Just someone I made
up to led The Network.

435
00:35:44,181 --> 00:35:46,576
At first, I just wanted
to help people get settled,

436
00:35:48,275 --> 00:35:50,264
give them food, find them work.

437
00:35:50,546 --> 00:35:52,553
Now there's a war against us.

438
00:35:52,357 --> 00:35:54,906
Von and his border vigilantes.

439
00:35:55,146 --> 00:35:56,427
Hunting us down like dogs.

440
00:35:57,788 --> 00:35:59,007
And there's no one there to stop them.

441
00:35:59,008 --> 00:35:59,724
You can...

442
00:36:02,251 --> 00:36:03,670
You're a fighter

443
00:36:04,768 --> 00:36:06,912
Only when there is
something worth fighting for.

444
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,045
Is there?

445
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,383
Always.

446
00:36:26,612 --> 00:36:28,662
When the sun rises, you should be good.

447
00:36:31,146 --> 00:36:33,684
Don't start something
that you can't finish.

448
00:36:35,176 --> 00:36:36,407
Machete.

449
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:38,344
You know me?

450
00:36:39,162 --> 00:36:40,205
I know the legend.

451
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,151
Maybe the legend's better.

452
00:36:50,336 --> 00:36:51,589
I'll be the judge of that.

453
00:37:08,055 --> 00:37:10,698
Where are you? Mr. Mysterious?

454
00:37:38,604 --> 00:37:39,627
Oh my god...

455
00:37:41,957 --> 00:37:44,597
Codename: Machete Former Federal.

456
00:37:44,823 --> 00:37:46,236
Gunning the Senator down in the street!

457
00:37:45,552 --> 00:37:47,654
What on earth were they thinking?

458
00:37:48,385 --> 00:37:51,704
Sometimes I worry about April and
what kinda world we're living here.

459
00:37:53,892 --> 00:37:55,476
A fucked up world.

460
00:37:56,397 --> 00:37:58,304
I'd ought to wash your
mouth out with soap.

461
00:37:58,041 --> 00:37:59,600
Give me another that taco.

462
00:37:59,608 --> 00:38:02,048
Someone took a shot at a senator.
What world would you call it?

463
00:38:02,049 --> 00:38:03,629
A fucked up world.

464
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,197
Like two peas in a pod.

465
00:38:06,198 --> 00:38:08,335
So! Hmm...

466
00:38:06,629 --> 00:38:10,540
I think David is going
to ask me to marry him.

467
00:38:13,334 --> 00:38:15,070
But I have my priorities.

468
00:38:15,075 --> 00:38:16,029
School and a career.

469
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:17,375
Salsa!

470
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,773
Actually I was thinking
more about my modeling.

471
00:38:21,697 --> 00:38:23,204
You are a very pretty girl April,

472
00:38:24,671 --> 00:38:26,126
but that's tough enough to crack.

473
00:38:27,008 --> 00:38:28,897
I know all about cracking nuts.

474
00:38:33,357 --> 00:38:35,291
Do you even know how many
hits I get on my website?

475
00:38:35,735 --> 00:38:37,954
You own a website? She has a
website? Did you know about this?

476
00:38:38,241 --> 00:38:40,831
I know all about what
the online public wants.

477
00:38:41,428 --> 00:38:42,547
And they want ME!

478
00:38:42,924 --> 00:38:43,706
All of ME!

479
00:38:46,906 --> 00:38:49,083
That does it. I'm
sending you to a convent.

480
00:38:50,675 --> 00:38:51,420
What?

481
00:38:51,265 --> 00:38:53,247
He's loose. He got away.

482
00:38:53,338 --> 00:38:56,151
God Damn! How hard is it for you
to kill a god damn day labourer?

483
00:38:56,153 --> 00:38:58,060
You get to that corner
where I picked him up.

484
00:38:58,061 --> 00:38:59,104
You find him!

485
00:38:59,358 --> 00:39:00,402
Do IT!

486
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,646
Seen a big wagon?

487
00:39:15,014 --> 00:39:16,919
No... No speak english.

488
00:39:18,504 --> 00:39:20,446
Speak. 45?

489
00:39:21,478 --> 00:39:23,354
Where's the tacos truck lady at?

490
00:39:25,022 --> 00:39:28,283
Hey! I don't know man. I haven't
seen her this morning. She's late.

491
00:39:29,595 --> 00:39:31,293
She...

492
00:39:34,816 --> 00:39:36,430
You know where you lives...

493
00:40:27,504 --> 00:40:29,033
Alright... go get him.

494
00:41:45,177 --> 00:41:46,904
You're all over the god damn TV.

495
00:41:47,744 --> 00:41:49,601
Get in!

496
00:41:50,278 --> 00:41:51,378
Agent

497
00:41:54,695 --> 00:41:57,301
You're the second beautiful
girl that picked me up today.

498
00:42:03,392 --> 00:42:04,434
Exploding houses!

499
00:42:04,668 --> 00:42:05,710
Bodies falling from the sky!

500
00:42:06,734 --> 00:42:08,548
Jesus Christ Machete...

501
00:42:08,631 --> 00:42:10,349
You're a walking SHIT MAGNET!

502
00:42:11,642 --> 00:42:13,060
Ya! I know who you are...

503
00:42:13,832 --> 00:42:14,923
I'm Santana Evira.

504
00:42:15,769 --> 00:42:17,496
Immigration Customs
and Enforcement (ICE).

505
00:42:18,195 --> 00:42:19,232
ICE.

506
00:42:19,233 --> 00:42:21,577
Fuckin' A! La Migra (immigration)...

507
00:42:22,078 --> 00:42:25,184
Don't worry, I won't ship you back,
if you tell me what I need to know.

508
00:42:24,976 --> 00:42:26,379
Working my way up.

509
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:29,124
I can't be busting people
like tacos stands anymore.

510
00:42:29,125 --> 00:42:31,150
Well, I'm probably
related to half of them.

511
00:42:31,392 --> 00:42:33,196
You need me more than I need you.

512
00:42:33,925 --> 00:42:34,391
Come on.

513
00:42:34,392 --> 00:42:38,404
You know all the cops in this state are
hunting you down for trying to kill a senator.

514
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:40,620
I wasn't gonna kill him.

515
00:42:41,886 --> 00:42:43,037
Just gonna shoot him in the neck,

516
00:42:43,038 --> 00:42:45,686
Stop him from saying
all those stupid things.

517
00:42:45,956 --> 00:42:47,567
It was a set up.

518
00:42:48,018 --> 00:42:49,344
There was another shooter there.

519
00:42:49,464 --> 00:42:50,651
There was another shooter?

520
00:42:50,653 --> 00:42:51,696
Who?

521
00:43:01,909 --> 00:43:02,941
Drive!

522
00:43:05,368 --> 00:43:06,370
Drive.

523
00:43:12,788 --> 00:43:15,239
I know what they did to your family.

524
00:43:15,418 --> 00:43:17,231
And if I were you I wouldn't
trust anyone neither,

525
00:43:17,232 --> 00:43:18,558
but it's different here.

526
00:43:19,078 --> 00:43:20,697
Laws are enforced.

527
00:43:20,871 --> 00:43:24,073
And people control them. Not drug lords.

528
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:27,606
The system works here...

529
00:43:27,713 --> 00:43:28,755
Says you.

530
00:43:28,891 --> 00:43:31,882
I started working on the night
shift taking out the trash.

531
00:43:32,675 --> 00:43:34,109
But I worked my way up.

532
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:36,921
As translator, assistant...

533
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,896
Now I'm special agent in
charge of investigations.

534
00:43:41,443 --> 00:43:44,402
Sounds like they still got
you taking out the trash.

535
00:43:45,002 --> 00:43:46,595
Let me take you in...

536
00:43:47,151 --> 00:43:48,849
Put you into witness protection.

537
00:43:49,482 --> 00:43:52,965
All you got to do is tell me who
hired you to take out the senator.

538
00:44:01,272 --> 00:44:02,352
Fine.

539
00:44:04,776 --> 00:44:07,249
Holy Shit.

540
00:44:08,257 --> 00:44:12,309
You mean to tell me that a Mexican
daily is a god damn federale?

541
00:44:12,251 --> 00:44:17,523
That's right, CIA, FBI, DEA, all
rolled in one mean fucking burrito.

542
00:44:17,716 --> 00:44:20,033
Is this the man who you
assigned to kill Machete?

543
00:44:21,377 --> 00:44:22,466
Yes.

544
00:44:23,103 --> 00:44:25,562
And so far you failed.

545
00:44:27,323 --> 00:44:28,325
So far.

546
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:32,397
I'm sorry to see you have a high
tolerance for failure Bon nita.

547
00:44:32,978 --> 00:44:34,281
I don't...

548
00:44:47,674 --> 00:44:48,634
not bad

549
00:44:48,903 --> 00:44:50,700
The last time we spoke you could have
mentioned that he was a god damn federale!

550
00:44:50,701 --> 00:44:51,744
God Dammit!

551
00:44:51,872 --> 00:44:54,548
Notoriously is hard to kill, trust me.

552
00:44:54,549 --> 00:44:55,592
I've tried.

553
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,497
Well, you didn't try with
the guy I'm calling in.

554
00:44:59,636 --> 00:45:02,514
The very best the great
state of Texas has to offer.

555
00:45:03,983 --> 00:45:07,287
Osiris Amanpour.

556
00:45:07,668 --> 00:45:09,522
If Machete is captured alive.

557
00:45:09,523 --> 00:45:12,721
He'll expose my entire operation.

558
00:45:13,538 --> 00:45:15,712
You have 24 hours take him down,

559
00:45:15,714 --> 00:45:17,314
or I'll come over there myself...

560
00:45:18,097 --> 00:45:20,345
And I'll kill him myself.

561
00:45:28,044 --> 00:45:30,872
Sorry, my friend.

562
00:45:33,079 --> 00:45:36,502
My grandfather always says you
can solve any problem with food.

563
00:45:37,237 --> 00:45:38,416
And you my friend,

564
00:45:39,676 --> 00:45:41,375
have plenty of problems.

565
00:45:44,089 --> 00:45:45,935
So who you working for?

566
00:45:46,396 --> 00:45:47,844
Who wants the senator dead?

567
00:45:47,888 --> 00:45:49,155
Is it The Network?

568
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:50,875
Luz?

569
00:45:50,876 --> 00:45:52,088
She doesn't know anything about it.

570
00:45:53,608 --> 00:45:54,634
Network either.

571
00:45:55,113 --> 00:45:56,570
The man who hired me...

572
00:45:57,106 --> 00:45:57,567
was a Mexican.

573
00:45:57,916 --> 00:45:58,884
Really

574
00:46:00,195 --> 00:46:02,711
So he was just a random guy who says...

575
00:46:02,712 --> 00:46:04,474
hey, wanna kill the senator today?

576
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:06,197
And you are like cool?

577
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,288
I was afraid he wanted receptive work.

578
00:46:09,289 --> 00:46:13,527
Instead, he offered me
$150,000 to kill the senator.

579
00:46:14,194 --> 00:46:15,385
That's a lot of money.

580
00:46:16,168 --> 00:46:17,471
So that's why you did it?

581
00:46:19,576 --> 00:46:20,779
For the money.

582
00:46:22,356 --> 00:46:23,506
Look, Machete.

583
00:46:26,272 --> 00:46:28,002
You're not legal in this country.

584
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:32,111
And after what happened in Mexico
there is no way you're going home.

585
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,122
So basically, you're
a man with no country.

586
00:46:37,596 --> 00:46:39,873
And lucky for you. I can help you out.

587
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:41,182
Look at me.

588
00:46:42,786 --> 00:46:44,188
I can get you papers.

589
00:46:46,129 --> 00:46:48,305
But you've got to let me bring you in.

590
00:46:56,998 --> 00:46:59,214
I'm gonna find the guy who did this.

591
00:47:00,861 --> 00:47:02,819
And bring him to you.

592
00:47:03,354 --> 00:47:05,185
Why should I trust you?

593
00:47:12,481 --> 00:47:14,355
Because we are both cops.

594
00:47:19,005 --> 00:47:22,043
I'd tell you to stop, but
I know you took the bullets.

595
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:33,783
Luz!

596
00:47:34,396 --> 00:47:35,439
Luz!

597
00:47:37,281 --> 00:47:39,776
You wouldn't think they'll
take me down that easily did ya?

598
00:47:41,821 --> 00:47:44,235
You're alive. But your house man!

599
00:47:44,004 --> 00:47:45,912
It was small...

600
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,843
I've got something to
show you guys, come on...

601
00:48:01,625 --> 00:48:03,490
Told you they were gunning for us.

602
00:48:04,259 --> 00:48:05,835
Who knows what they'll gonna do next.

603
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:08,577
Holy shit, Luz!

604
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:10,077
I didn't now that you were this loaded.

605
00:48:10,078 --> 00:48:11,981
You got more heat than
the Popos (police).

606
00:48:12,125 --> 00:48:14,839
It's a good start,
but we need a lot more.

607
00:48:14,485 --> 00:48:15,581
Need it for what?

608
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:18,311
La Revoluzion. (The Revolution).

609
00:48:18,865 --> 00:48:20,990
Van and his men are coming for us.

610
00:48:21,223 --> 00:48:22,613
We need to be ready.

611
00:48:22,803 --> 00:48:24,178
I'm not gonna be around forever.

612
00:48:24,778 --> 00:48:29,220
If anything happens, you need to
tell Machete the people need him.

613
00:48:29,193 --> 00:48:31,065
Who exactly is this Machete?

614
00:48:33,391 --> 00:48:35,230
That's him...

615
00:48:36,634 --> 00:48:37,890
he's the one.

616
00:48:38,102 --> 00:48:39,265
Hands up!

617
00:48:40,025 --> 00:48:41,068
Against the wall.

618
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:43,387
All of you, move it!

619
00:48:47,897 --> 00:48:49,224
Where's Machete?

620
00:48:49,501 --> 00:48:50,923
Shit. She knows. Man!

621
00:48:50,924 --> 00:48:51,966
Amigo's gonna deport our ass back.

622
00:48:53,393 --> 00:48:54,980
Nobodies deporting anybody.

623
00:48:54,981 --> 00:48:57,794
Machete already told me you guys
weren't involved in the shooting.

624
00:48:57,899 --> 00:49:02,833
Although... I should
probably check the "carnitas".

625
00:49:04,194 --> 00:49:05,252
For lead!

626
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:07,585
What is this place anyway?

627
00:49:15,503 --> 00:49:17,275
Welcome to The Network.

628
00:49:17,948 --> 00:49:19,532
These are some of the
people that I've help.

629
00:49:20,081 --> 00:49:21,943
Help them cross,

630
00:49:21,944 --> 00:49:23,465
Got them jobs,

631
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:25,680
then make sure that they do their part.

632
00:49:26,262 --> 00:49:28,248
And this?

633
00:49:28,769 --> 00:49:30,496
These are the guys trying to stop us.

634
00:49:30,525 --> 00:49:33,630
Van Jackson and his Border Vigilantes.

635
00:49:33,841 --> 00:49:37,402
They started off with a couple of deer
rifles and a warped sense of justice.

636
00:49:38,007 --> 00:49:39,193
Then in the last year they've grown.

637
00:49:39,848 --> 00:49:41,685
More guns, more men.

638
00:49:42,158 --> 00:49:43,361
Who's funding them?

639
00:49:44,042 --> 00:49:46,274
Whoever it is, is making
a mess of our operation.

640
00:49:46,898 --> 00:49:48,410
And these?

641
00:49:51,268 --> 00:49:51,902
Missing

642
00:49:53,483 --> 00:49:56,625
They are supposed to have crossed.
But I have no way to track them.

643
00:49:56,722 --> 00:49:58,445
How deep does your operation go?

644
00:49:58,446 --> 00:49:59,488
Deep.

645
00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:05,048
All types, all races. Lawyers,
priests, doctors, homeboys...

646
00:50:05,986 --> 00:50:07,823
That's why they call it "The Network".

647
00:50:08,098 --> 00:50:10,899
The way we see it. People
risk everything to get here.

648
00:50:12,917 --> 00:50:14,427
The system doesn't work.

649
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:16,232
It's broken.

650
00:50:17,414 --> 00:50:19,261
So we created our own.

651
00:50:22,014 --> 00:50:23,411
You gonna burn us? huh?

652
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:24,936
Turn us all in?

653
00:50:25,406 --> 00:50:26,378
no

654
00:50:28,055 --> 00:50:31,307
I'm gonna walk away and pretend
I didn't see any of this.

655
00:50:31,809 --> 00:50:33,512
Tell Machete I'm looking for him!

656
00:50:47,455 --> 00:50:48,534
I am a man of faith,

657
00:50:49,148 --> 00:50:50,520
I took a vow of peace.

658
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:53,103
And I don't shoot anymore.

659
00:50:53,146 --> 00:50:54,710
And you don't shoot any less either.

660
00:50:55,038 --> 00:50:58,230
I don't see you or heard
from you in three years,

661
00:50:58,531 --> 00:51:01,236
And now you want me to
help you kill all these men?

662
00:51:02,508 --> 00:51:04,416
Yes, brother...

663
00:51:05,219 --> 00:51:06,922
I mean, Padre (Father).

664
00:51:11,427 --> 00:51:13,444
I'll see what I can do.

665
00:51:15,333 --> 00:51:18,941
I want you to say 10 our
fathers and 10 hail marys.

666
00:51:19,096 --> 00:51:21,611
Light a candle for mom...

667
00:51:23,717 --> 00:51:26,222
For funerals. A little side business.

668
00:51:30,133 --> 00:51:34,005
I have these installed when too many things started
walking away from the altar and collection plates.

669
00:51:34,006 --> 00:51:37,312
Imagine if we have these kinda
setup for all the federales.

670
00:51:37,523 --> 00:51:38,986
This is how you get the bad guys now.

671
00:51:38,987 --> 00:51:40,413
You catch them on video.

672
00:51:41,727 --> 00:51:43,531
Cuban?

673
00:51:44,546 --> 00:51:45,645
Mexican.

674
00:51:46,017 --> 00:51:47,482
Yeah, I got some of that.

675
00:51:53,856 --> 00:51:55,091
I've got something I want you to see

676
00:51:55,092 --> 00:51:57,184
Rest assure he will be caught.

677
00:51:58,855 --> 00:52:00,765
It is the first shot of the war that...

678
00:52:00,767 --> 00:52:02,023
we didn't ask for.

679
00:52:02,363 --> 00:52:04,346
Nice way to find out
your brother's in town.

680
00:52:05,941 --> 00:52:06,983
Right there.

681
00:52:09,010 --> 00:52:10,101
That's the guy that hired me.

682
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:11,409
Michael Booth?

683
00:52:12,688 --> 00:52:14,153
He's McLaughlin's aid or some shit.

684
00:52:17,192 --> 00:52:18,256
You know him?

685
00:52:18,592 --> 00:52:21,827
Yeah... he comes in for
confession all the time.

686
00:52:21,974 --> 00:52:24,571
Lots of impure thoughts.

687
00:52:24,572 --> 00:52:26,575
Mostly about his daughter.

688
00:52:27,697 --> 00:52:29,396
I guess I'm cheaper than
a shrink (psychiatrist).

689
00:52:30,706 --> 00:52:31,707
Here's his file.

690
00:52:31,951 --> 00:52:34,376
Once he started talking about
his connection to the cartels.

691
00:52:34,377 --> 00:52:36,107
I figured. It'll come in handy.

692
00:52:35,824 --> 00:52:38,560
I bet McLaughlin doesn't even
know that most of Booth's,

693
00:52:38,561 --> 00:52:41,167
business are just a
front for his drug trade.

694
00:52:42,038 --> 00:52:45,966
What I don't understand is why
he hired you to kill his own boss.

695
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:46,665
Don't know.

696
00:52:48,589 --> 00:52:49,616
Gonna find out.

697
00:52:49,862 --> 00:52:51,797
It's not safe for you to be here.

698
00:52:52,372 --> 00:52:53,387
Not looking for safe.

699
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:55,227
No I mean it's not safe
for me for YOU to be here.

700
00:52:55,688 --> 00:52:56,750
I absolve you of all your sins,

701
00:52:56,751 --> 00:52:57,795
Now get the fuck out!

702
00:52:58,995 --> 00:52:59,996
Okay, bro...

703
00:53:02,543 --> 00:53:03,919
But I'm borrowing your car.

704
00:53:17,847 --> 00:53:19,578
Why are you complaining
about a weak neck,

705
00:53:19,579 --> 00:53:21,877
I'd said you should
fucking do some sit-ups.

706
00:53:22,573 --> 00:53:23,900
Hey... hey, hey boss?

707
00:53:24,582 --> 00:53:26,172
Who're you?

708
00:53:27,569 --> 00:53:29,092
The new gardener

709
00:53:30,067 --> 00:53:31,318
Gardener?

710
00:53:41,804 --> 00:53:43,626
I'm just fucking with you, chief.

711
00:53:43,627 --> 00:53:46,231
It's Hungarian, it means that
I'll kill you, you little monkey.

712
00:53:46,232 --> 00:53:48,441
You know what?

713
00:53:48,442 --> 00:53:50,030
You can go clean that up. Alright!

714
00:53:46,732 --> 00:53:47,775
There is a large pile shit in the back.

715
00:53:50,943 --> 00:53:52,445
Make sure you do a good job.

716
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:56,833
Make sure you wipe those boots off!

717
00:53:57,156 --> 00:53:58,660
He's carrying shit in the house.

718
00:53:59,763 --> 00:54:01,214
Did you ever notice that you
let go Mexicans into your home...

719
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:03,671
just because he's got gardening tools?

720
00:54:03,672 --> 00:54:04,510
I mean, no questions asked.

721
00:54:04,512 --> 00:54:05,435
You just let him right in.

722
00:54:08,301 --> 00:54:10,719
He could have a chainsaw or a machete...

723
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:16,700
God! Jesus!

724
00:54:30,943 --> 00:54:31,845
Stop it!

725
00:54:35,553 --> 00:54:36,554
Dammit, that hurts!

726
00:54:52,424 --> 00:54:54,533
If your father ever saw me, 2 minutes.

727
00:54:55,171 --> 00:54:56,474
Mom, everyone is gonna see you do this.

728
00:54:56,476 --> 00:54:57,518
it's the internet.

729
00:54:58,652 --> 00:55:01,370
This is what my viewers
wanna see online.

730
00:55:05,084 --> 00:55:07,549
Hey! You not the usual guy.

731
00:55:08,745 --> 00:55:09,963
He looks good to me.

732
00:55:11,731 --> 00:55:12,889
Oh don't be shy, come on in!

733
00:55:54,046 --> 00:55:55,067
Access denied.

734
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:12,285
What the fuck did you
bring them here for?

735
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:13,855
Didn't you hear a god damn word I said?

736
00:56:14,706 --> 00:56:15,241
Want me to dump them?

737
00:56:15,626 --> 00:56:16,669
What? No... no.

738
00:56:17,288 --> 00:56:18,331
I would make good use of them.

739
00:56:17,414 --> 00:56:21,583
The Church can always use good people.

740
00:56:33,811 --> 00:56:34,842
June?

741
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:37,681
April?

742
00:57:11,172 --> 00:57:13,010
Where's my wife and daughter?

743
00:57:13,254 --> 00:57:15,021
Woah... one family at a time.

744
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:16,123
It's Osiris...

745
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:19,185
Machete has a Amano (brother)..

746
00:57:19,891 --> 00:57:22,896
or should I say, Padre (Father).

747
00:57:25,015 --> 00:57:29,491
State Senator John McLaughlin took a vow
to defend the Constitution of this State.

748
00:57:29,634 --> 00:57:30,641
Now!

749
00:57:31,986 --> 00:57:33,859
he's taken a bullet for us.

750
00:57:39,058 --> 00:57:41,000
And this is that bullet.

751
00:57:41,275 --> 00:57:43,928
Vote to re-elect Sen. John McLaughlin.

752
00:57:44,343 --> 00:57:46,924
I'm John McLaughlin and
I approve of this message.

753
00:57:47,066 --> 00:57:50,174
Paid for by the Committee to
re-elect of John McLaughlin.

754
00:58:13,019 --> 00:58:13,611
Sorry ma'am.

755
00:58:15,137 --> 00:58:16,180
Damn new phone.

756
00:58:16,181 --> 00:58:17,704
Should put on the vibrator.

757
00:58:19,458 --> 00:58:20,483
Can you help me do that?

758
00:58:22,096 --> 00:58:23,119
Pervert.

759
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:28,093
Yeah?

760
00:58:28,094 --> 00:58:28,759
Senator?

761
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:30,693
It's Van.

762
00:58:31,481 --> 00:58:34,630
I hear you got a
problem maybe we can fix.

763
00:58:34,787 --> 00:58:37,292
Don't call me on this
line again. I'll call you.

764
00:58:36,879 --> 00:58:39,375
Now you said it yourself
Senator war has begun.

765
00:58:40,182 --> 00:58:41,992
Helter Skelter is here.

766
00:58:42,441 --> 00:58:44,633
Your army awaits further orders.

767
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:46,580
Got to be respectful now.

768
00:58:46,581 --> 00:58:47,681
No shit slaves.

769
00:58:50,163 --> 00:58:51,224
What about the shooter?

770
00:58:51,225 --> 00:58:52,914
He's still out there?

771
00:58:56,914 --> 00:59:01,790
There's nothing I'd like more, then to see that
Mexican dance the bolero with the end of the rope.

772
00:59:02,177 --> 00:59:04,767
He's gone underground for sure.

773
00:59:04,409 --> 00:59:06,216
Let's say we go underground.

774
00:59:06,969 --> 00:59:07,767
And get him.

775
00:59:08,409 --> 00:59:10,638
You find the Network
and you find the shooter.

776
00:59:10,701 --> 00:59:11,713
Call our special friend.

777
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:14,183
Tell him we're gonna need
a helluva more firepower.

778
00:59:14,184 --> 00:59:17,016
If he is serious about
wanting that border shut down.

779
00:59:18,172 --> 00:59:19,875
Fix your damn gun.

780
00:59:20,453 --> 00:59:21,456
Thanks.

781
00:59:24,998 --> 00:59:27,546
Our friend is up.

782
00:59:39,879 --> 00:59:41,682
Where the fuck have you been?

783
00:59:42,576 --> 00:59:44,961
You could at least texted me.

784
00:59:46,023 --> 00:59:48,338
Machete don't text.

785
00:59:51,756 --> 00:59:53,700
But Machete get evidence.

786
01:00:00,044 --> 01:00:02,291
Thanks for coming back.

787
01:00:03,533 --> 01:00:07,629
There is no way that McLaughlin is getting
elected, unless something big happens.

788
01:00:07,907 --> 01:00:11,415
Can you imagine if someone shot the
senator, and that someone was a Mexican.

789
01:00:11,416 --> 01:00:13,444
The public would elect
him to be president.

790
01:00:13,848 --> 01:00:17,507
It's not a sin if someone clinch
the senator in the leg is it?

791
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:19,754
So, this is footage from
your brother's confession?

792
01:00:19,755 --> 01:00:23,169
There's no open commandant
against thou shall not wing a man.

793
01:00:23,170 --> 01:00:24,212
Is there Padre?

794
01:00:24,043 --> 01:00:25,770
But these files over here.

795
01:00:25,771 --> 01:00:27,380
You got from Booth's office.

796
01:00:28,047 --> 01:00:28,913
They're encrypted.

797
01:00:31,281 --> 01:00:34,204
Is my little girl
April... I spent nights...

798
01:00:38,021 --> 01:00:38,720
Denied.

799
01:00:39,502 --> 01:00:41,202
You not going to think
it's that easy, Do you?

800
01:00:43,402 --> 01:00:46,903
I just wish that April
saw me as more a real man.

801
01:00:58,221 --> 01:00:59,222
Holy shit...

802
01:01:00,588 --> 01:01:02,206
You're right. The
Network is not behind it.

803
01:01:03,384 --> 01:01:05,029
This is something. A helluva lot bigger.

804
01:01:06,424 --> 01:01:10,894
You've got enough here
to bring down everyone.

805
01:01:08,862 --> 01:01:10,434
The Senator, Booth...

806
01:01:12,899 --> 01:01:13,901
Van...

807
01:01:15,206 --> 01:01:16,248
Look here.

808
01:01:16,518 --> 01:01:19,663
There's drug money financing
the Senator's campaign.

809
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:25,870
Rogelio Torrez.

810
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:29,205
Torrez...

811
01:01:30,796 --> 01:01:33,637
He's the drug kingpin who's been trying
to gain control of the drug trade.

812
01:01:34,884 --> 01:01:37,958
this must be the border fence
McLaughlin wants to build.

813
01:01:41,612 --> 01:01:42,879
See this?

814
01:01:43,252 --> 01:01:45,150
These markings show the weakest spots.

815
01:01:46,409 --> 01:01:47,535
It all makes sense now.

816
01:01:48,062 --> 01:01:50,278
Torrez wants to get Senator
McLaughlin re-elected,

817
01:01:50,279 --> 01:01:53,557
so that he can build a border
fence that he can control.

818
01:01:55,566 --> 01:01:57,694
You did good work Machete.

819
01:01:57,695 --> 01:02:00,177
I bet you're a great cop.

820
01:02:00,548 --> 01:02:01,776
The best.

821
01:02:02,058 --> 01:02:03,129
And modest too.

822
01:02:04,375 --> 01:02:05,853
I'm dry.

823
01:02:13,205 --> 01:02:13,731
Get up.

824
01:02:14,823 --> 01:02:15,866
Why?

825
01:02:17,262 --> 01:02:18,315
Because you're drunk.

826
01:02:23,993 --> 01:02:26,343
Come be with me.

827
01:02:51,186 --> 01:02:52,229
Speak english?

828
01:02:53,026 --> 01:02:55,004
Depends on the question.

829
01:02:56,790 --> 01:02:59,433
We know that you hired that
Mexican to kill our senator.

830
01:03:01,079 --> 01:03:02,681
You the Network? Ain't cha?

831
01:03:03,937 --> 01:03:05,641
Hell! You're behind everything.

832
01:03:06,443 --> 01:03:07,646
That's not how we work.

833
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:10,652
But if you want war...

834
01:03:12,057 --> 01:03:13,058
I will give it to you.

835
01:03:18,743 --> 01:03:20,307
How about an eye for an eye?

836
01:03:27,019 --> 01:03:29,012
You burned your last burrito.

837
01:03:33,221 --> 01:03:34,575
You got to get better at this, Billy.

838
01:04:38,312 --> 01:04:40,497
Please, Father, have mercy.

839
01:04:40,178 --> 01:04:43,685
God has mercy, I don't

840
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:55,334
Hello Padre (Father).

841
01:06:05,476 --> 01:06:08,355
The Blood of Christ?
Taste like Merlot to me.

842
01:06:10,707 --> 01:06:12,883
Where is he?

843
01:06:13,246 --> 01:06:15,154
He's everywhere.

844
01:06:16,825 --> 01:06:18,289
Talk Padre.

845
01:06:18,911 --> 01:06:22,941
Sing me one of those Mexican
hymns like a chroming arch boy.

846
01:06:23,191 --> 01:06:24,694
Go to hell.

847
01:06:38,062 --> 01:06:41,323
You want to be a martyr?
I'm good at making martyrs.

848
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:43,892
Like Senator McLaughlin?

849
01:06:44,684 --> 01:06:45,905
That's right.

850
01:06:45,751 --> 01:06:48,624
We have to get that Senator re-elected.
Get that fence built along the border.

851
01:06:48,625 --> 01:06:50,542
before it is too late.

852
01:06:51,211 --> 01:06:52,974
You really hate our kind that much?

853
01:06:53,357 --> 01:06:57,371
No padre, I hate declining
profits that much.

854
01:06:58,147 --> 01:07:00,923
An open border allows
supply of flowing too easily.

855
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:03,147
Drives our prices down.

856
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:07,997
Restricted border limits
supply. Drives the prices up.

857
01:07:08,335 --> 01:07:11,268
Higher price, higher profits.

858
01:07:11,296 --> 01:07:15,253
You are drunk with power, even
putting the hit on your own boss.

859
01:07:17,995 --> 01:07:20,009
Just to boost his election numbers.

860
01:07:22,431 --> 01:07:24,236
Last chance, amigo.

861
01:07:25,759 --> 01:07:28,483
Where's Machete and where
are my wife and daughter?

862
01:07:32,509 --> 01:07:34,453
In hell.

863
01:07:37,910 --> 01:07:39,444
Then give them my best.

864
01:08:06,522 --> 01:08:09,383
A real gentleman.

865
01:08:25,281 --> 01:08:26,309
Comfortable...

866
01:09:32,124 --> 01:09:33,857
Are they the same?

867
01:09:36,658 --> 01:09:38,940
They want you dead too.

868
01:09:39,935 --> 01:09:41,437
My brother.

869
01:09:42,349 --> 01:09:43,605
Wait!

870
01:10:16,039 --> 01:10:17,647
How do you text with this thing?

871
01:10:23,637 --> 01:10:24,772
I thought Machete don't text.

872
01:10:29,264 --> 01:10:30,662
Machete improvise.

873
01:10:36,697 --> 01:10:37,997
Where're you going?

874
01:10:39,771 --> 01:10:41,278
Take out the trash.

875
01:11:03,154 --> 01:11:04,713
Machete, sent me a text.

876
01:11:05,189 --> 01:11:06,820
What's it say?

877
01:11:07,818 --> 01:11:12,181
You just fuck with the wrong Mexican.

878
01:11:13,654 --> 01:11:15,084
He's coming after us.

879
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:18,397
No, he's coming after you.

880
01:11:21,436 --> 01:11:22,993
You got some news?

881
01:11:23,038 --> 01:11:24,070
Yes.

882
01:11:25,525 --> 01:11:26,843
His brother's is dead.

883
01:11:26,844 --> 01:11:28,317
You killed a priest.

884
01:11:28,318 --> 01:11:29,361
Congratulations.

885
01:11:32,262 --> 01:11:34,850
That's right Booth, I'm in your town.

886
01:11:34,851 --> 01:11:37,138
And I'm gonna kill Machete.

887
01:11:37,669 --> 01:11:39,018
And you're gonna watch it happen.

888
01:11:39,463 --> 01:11:42,000
And it will be the last you see.

889
01:11:42,045 --> 01:11:43,082
Wait a second.

890
01:11:43,714 --> 01:11:45,621
There's a girl from ICE.

891
01:11:45,728 --> 01:11:48,253
She's with Machete and
they have a file on me,

892
01:11:48,254 --> 01:11:50,718
on you, on McLaughlin, on everybody.

893
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:54,633
She can make things
very difficult for us.

894
01:11:54,772 --> 01:11:56,715
Where is she?

895
01:11:56,752 --> 01:12:00,000
You know, I've been thinking.

896
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:02,544
We let these people into our homes,

897
01:12:02,545 --> 01:12:04,565
Watch our kids,

898
01:12:04,705 --> 01:12:07,160
park our cars.

899
01:12:07,746 --> 01:12:09,531
But we won't let them, into our country.

900
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:12,437
Does that make any sense to you?

901
01:12:12,371 --> 01:12:15,249
Hey! That wetback whack the
both of us over the head.

902
01:12:15,038 --> 01:12:17,353
In case you forgot,
he shot me in the leg.

903
01:12:17,606 --> 01:12:19,956
I thought Jango shot you?

904
01:12:20,097 --> 01:12:21,761
I don't want to hear that story again.

905
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:22,812
Think about it.

906
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:24,696
He wasn't here for us.

907
01:12:25,073 --> 01:12:26,196
He's here for the boss.

908
01:12:26,339 --> 01:12:30,369
I've been watching the boss.
This guy is a real scumbag.

909
01:12:30,425 --> 01:12:31,505
Hey, hey, hey.

910
01:12:31,906 --> 01:12:33,832
Where's your loyalty at?

911
01:12:42,682 --> 01:12:44,346
Did you hear that?

912
01:12:46,540 --> 01:12:47,936
It's weed whacker.

913
01:12:47,813 --> 01:12:49,587
He's back! Spread out.

914
01:12:50,030 --> 01:12:51,061
Spread out NOW!

915
01:13:10,669 --> 01:13:11,347
Alpha unit, you copy?

916
01:13:16,711 --> 01:13:18,177
Quit!

917
01:13:23,264 --> 01:13:25,509
Anybody report. You hear me?

918
01:13:26,063 --> 01:13:27,460
Anybody?

919
01:13:36,096 --> 01:13:37,865
Where's Booth?

920
01:13:36,950 --> 01:13:38,471
The senator, his with the senator.

921
01:13:39,254 --> 01:13:40,357
I have a GPS.

922
01:13:41,817 --> 01:13:42,596
Tracks his limo.

923
01:13:43,099 --> 01:13:45,754
Hey! Don't kill me, please, take it.

924
01:13:52,479 --> 01:13:56,914
That's Spanish, "I let you live. "

925
01:13:57,463 --> 01:14:00,046
Thanks Chief

926
01:14:02,545 --> 01:14:04,217
Let me see if I am hearing you right.

927
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:06,336
One of the city's most
prominent businessmen.

928
01:14:06,337 --> 01:14:07,379
A Texas vigilante.

929
01:14:08,148 --> 01:14:12,156
The most notorious drug kingpin
of Mexico and a state senator,

930
01:14:12,157 --> 01:14:15,363
are all conspiring to enact
stricter immigration laws?

931
01:14:15,578 --> 01:14:19,232
I know how it sounds, but I have
Booth on video committing a murder.

932
01:14:19,233 --> 01:14:20,378
I have tons of confessions.

933
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:21,252
I mean it's...

934
01:14:21,712 --> 01:14:27,616
Listen to yourself, this man is an illegal
alien, ILLEGAL as in against the law.

935
01:14:28,356 --> 01:14:31,623
Well, there's the law
and there's what's right.

936
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:37,396
I'm gonna do what's right.

937
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:58,397
<i>We are live from the Church
of Hope where just moments ago.</i>

938
01:14:58,264 --> 01:15:00,368
<i>Police discovered a gruesome murder.</i>

939
01:15:00,369 --> 01:15:02,874
<i>The body of a priest was
found nailed to the cross.</i>

940
01:15:02,875 --> 01:15:05,779
<i>And witnesses descriptions
of a man leaving the church.</i>

941
01:15:05,881 --> 01:15:08,987
<i>Match those of a gunman wanted for
the shooting of Senator McLaughlin.</i>

942
01:15:09,088 --> 01:15:11,836
Excuse me, honey's just shut
the door and give us a moment.

943
01:15:12,196 --> 01:15:13,999
<i>On the street, they call him Machete.</i>

944
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,290
<i>Who is he, what is he?</i>

945
01:15:16,291 --> 01:15:18,210
<i>And will he ever be brought down?</i>

946
01:15:18,774 --> 01:15:19,395
Where the fuck have you been?

947
01:15:19,938 --> 01:15:21,777
This story is burning the whole
fucking town to the ground.

948
01:15:21,778 --> 01:15:23,481
It's giving us a war
that I know we can win!

949
01:15:23,547 --> 01:15:25,579
He's a cockroach, sooner
or later he'll be squashed.

950
01:15:25,581 --> 01:15:25,902
Oh, oh, yeah!

951
01:15:25,867 --> 01:15:27,945
Well, this roach has got AK-47's

952
01:15:27,946 --> 01:15:30,333
and he's laying waste to everything
that get's in his fucking path.

953
01:15:30,203 --> 01:15:32,048
I'm taking care of it.

954
01:15:32,113 --> 01:15:33,989
They scheduled me for release
in a couple of minutes...

955
01:15:33,990 --> 01:15:37,071
I can't walk outta here like a
fucking piñata waiting to get whacked.

956
01:15:37,073 --> 01:15:38,887
The man they are calling Machete...
- We're ready for you Senator.

957
01:15:41,102 --> 01:15:44,138
It's show time...

958
01:15:46,850 --> 01:15:47,851
You forgot your cane, sir.

959
01:15:53,043 --> 01:15:53,998
Ladies and gentlemen,

960
01:15:54,346 --> 01:15:58,017
Senator John McLaughlin.

961
01:16:04,345 --> 01:16:05,546
Thank you, thank you.

962
01:16:07,735 --> 01:16:11,112
This freehold danzito is
not any closer to justice.

963
01:16:11,558 --> 01:16:15,107
I "urge" this criminal and
those that are hiding him,

964
01:16:14,653 --> 01:16:15,720
to turn him in.

965
01:16:16,124 --> 01:16:18,203
He's destroying us from the inside,

966
01:16:18,204 --> 01:16:20,027
like the plague that he is...

967
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:24,918
We must not let terrorist win.

968
01:16:24,919 --> 01:16:25,886
Senator?

969
01:16:25,887 --> 01:16:27,269
There are reports implicating,

970
01:16:27,270 --> 01:16:30,909
your advisors as having orchestrating
the assassination attempt.

971
01:16:31,391 --> 01:16:34,184
Would you care to comment?

972
01:16:35,861 --> 01:16:37,421
What now?

973
01:16:40,498 --> 01:16:43,121
<i>Want to be a martyr? I
am good at making martyrs.</i>

974
01:16:43,510 --> 01:16:45,177
<i>Like Senator McLaughlin?</i>

975
01:16:45,064 --> 01:16:46,139
<i>That's right.</i>

976
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:49,386
<i>We have to get that Senator re-elected.
Get that fence built along the border.</i>

977
01:16:49,387 --> 01:16:50,430
<i>Before it's too late.</i>

978
01:16:51,228 --> 01:16:52,503
Or do you care to comment,

979
01:16:52,504 --> 01:16:54,038
on the shooting. That happened

980
01:16:54,039 --> 01:16:56,658
on the border on the night of July 22nd?

981
01:16:57,985 --> 01:16:59,253
<i>Who is gonna stop us?</i>

982
01:16:59,254 --> 01:17:00,296
<i>I am!</i>

983
01:17:02,132 --> 01:17:03,362
<i>Welcome to the America.</i>

984
01:17:06,177 --> 01:17:07,447
<i>You catch all that?</i>

985
01:17:07,448 --> 01:17:10,672
<i>Burn me a DVD. Behind our
supporters are going to like that!</i>

986
01:17:10,673 --> 01:17:11,715
<i>A lot!</i>

987
01:17:14,436 --> 01:17:17,638
How about your connections with
drug king pin Rogelio Torrez?

988
01:17:17,897 --> 01:17:18,539
No further comment.

989
01:17:19,087 --> 01:17:19,661
I'm sorry, I just...

990
01:17:19,662 --> 01:17:22,149
Or the border vigilantes
involved in running drugs?

991
01:17:24,763 --> 01:17:25,971
I think I'm having a heart attack.

992
01:17:26,166 --> 01:17:28,688
God dammit if you don't
relax you will have one.

993
01:17:39,244 --> 01:17:41,174
You jeopardize more than my career,

994
01:17:41,175 --> 01:17:42,235
We got cut back.

995
01:17:42,999 --> 01:17:44,073
He could have killed me.

996
01:17:43,857 --> 01:17:45,260
Not with that scope.

997
01:17:47,014 --> 01:17:49,021
You stupid son of a bitch...

998
01:17:48,214 --> 01:17:51,067
You pulled something like
that without consulting me?

999
01:17:51,531 --> 01:17:52,714
Who the fuck do you think you are?!

1000
01:17:52,890 --> 01:17:56,195
I'm the one who got
your campaign financed.

1001
01:17:55,923 --> 01:17:58,035
Made you a political powerhouse.

1002
01:17:57,717 --> 01:17:59,298
Your own personal Jesus.

1003
01:17:59,409 --> 01:18:00,384
So, you better get down on your knees,

1004
01:18:00,385 --> 01:18:01,830
and start praying for
me to save your soul

1005
01:18:01,831 --> 01:18:04,305
Because I'm the only one
who can at this point!

1006
01:18:16,670 --> 01:18:18,812
Get the fuck out.

1007
01:18:49,544 --> 01:18:52,215
God dammit man, why don't you just die?

1008
01:18:53,677 --> 01:18:54,679
It's gonna work.

1009
01:18:55,115 --> 01:18:56,117
We could have been rich.

1010
01:18:55,916 --> 01:18:57,968
Torrez.

1011
01:18:57,969 --> 01:18:59,901
Was stopping all those cheap
shit from across the border.

1012
01:18:59,902 --> 01:19:00,944
Did I tell you that?

1013
01:18:59,223 --> 01:19:03,752
Can lead more than a tired pendejo
(fool) with a dime bag and a dream.

1014
01:19:04,684 --> 01:19:06,098
So we financed Van.

1015
01:19:03,231 --> 01:19:07,040
Giving them men guns.

1016
01:19:07,041 --> 01:19:08,041
The Vigilantes.

1017
01:19:09,168 --> 01:19:10,900
Our own little private border patrol.

1018
01:19:11,667 --> 01:19:14,487
But Torrez wanted all that chelada.

1019
01:19:14,245 --> 01:19:17,103
So I thought why not let
politics do what guns couldn't.

1020
01:19:17,857 --> 01:19:22,466
Funny things is that I thought
it would be a peaceful solution.

1021
01:19:23,754 --> 01:19:25,403
None of that tortured taco.

1022
01:19:26,938 --> 01:19:27,768
Wait, wait...

1023
01:19:28,345 --> 01:19:29,388
Torrez is looking for you.

1024
01:19:29,472 --> 01:19:31,421
You find Van, you'll find Torrez.

1025
01:19:33,127 --> 01:19:34,427
Please...

1026
01:19:35,676 --> 01:19:36,116
Tell me...

1027
01:19:36,627 --> 01:19:38,133
where are my wife and daughter?

1028
01:19:40,393 --> 01:19:41,414
With God.

1029
01:19:42,810 --> 01:19:44,959
I guess I won't be seeing them.

1030
01:19:59,384 --> 01:20:01,082
Fuck! My head...

1031
01:20:04,029 --> 01:20:05,798
What is this shit?

1032
01:20:06,177 --> 01:20:07,889
That asshole drugged us.

1033
01:20:08,735 --> 01:20:09,778
Where are our clothes?

1034
01:20:10,554 --> 01:20:12,624
Call daddy.

1035
01:20:26,564 --> 01:20:27,050
It's June,

1036
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:29,502
and April.

1037
01:20:30,776 --> 01:20:32,887
We're very sorry.

1038
01:20:33,264 --> 01:20:34,542
Your husband is dead.

1039
01:20:36,029 --> 01:20:37,120
He's what?

1040
01:20:36,857 --> 01:20:38,509
Senator McLaughlin shot him.

1041
01:20:57,110 --> 01:21:00,263
Secure that weapon! Yeah!

1042
01:21:00,583 --> 01:21:03,235
<i>Vigilante leader, Van Jackson
has refused declined comment,</i>

1043
01:21:03,236 --> 01:21:05,733
<i>after startling revelations
of their connections,</i>

1044
01:21:05,734 --> 01:21:06,796
<i>to the Mexican drug cartels.</i>

1045
01:21:08,012 --> 01:21:09,013
This is Van...

1046
01:21:08,538 --> 01:21:09,552
I'm coming in.

1047
01:21:09,553 --> 01:21:11,721
We're all over the news senator...

1048
01:21:11,722 --> 01:21:14,228
You compromised
everything we worked for.

1049
01:21:14,796 --> 01:21:16,174
There is only one way this is gonna end.

1050
01:21:16,175 --> 01:21:17,218
smoke em' out.

1051
01:21:17,802 --> 01:21:19,745
But I wanna put a bullet
in his head myself.

1052
01:21:20,532 --> 01:21:22,091
And just how you're
figuring on doing that?

1053
01:21:22,254 --> 01:21:25,783
I'm joining you boys
for one last ride along.

1054
01:21:42,339 --> 01:21:43,382
Machete.

1055
01:21:44,392 --> 01:21:46,092
Where's Luz?

1056
01:21:48,372 --> 01:21:49,966
She's gone, man.

1057
01:21:49,511 --> 01:21:51,507
Vigilante's got her.

1058
01:21:51,508 --> 01:21:53,134
And now they're after you.

1059
01:21:53,471 --> 01:21:54,584
You gotta lead us to fight,

1060
01:21:54,585 --> 01:21:55,980
it's what Luz would have want!

1061
01:21:55,826 --> 01:21:57,420
Not your war.

1062
01:21:58,037 --> 01:21:59,589
I maybe adopted as'say.

1063
01:22:00,016 --> 01:22:00,860
No shit.

1064
01:22:00,399 --> 01:22:03,176
What's going on, not right!

1065
01:22:03,627 --> 01:22:05,390
We just wanna help, bro.

1066
01:22:05,143 --> 01:22:06,737
I don't need your help.

1067
01:22:09,184 --> 01:22:10,210
Not us?

1068
01:22:11,690 --> 01:22:12,845
Then who?

1069
01:22:23,579 --> 01:22:24,571
Whatever you need.

1070
01:22:24,051 --> 01:22:26,501
Build it, strip it, chop it.

1071
01:22:27,534 --> 01:22:28,827
Garage's is yours, Homez...

1072
01:22:29,073 --> 01:22:30,363
Got guns?

1073
01:22:30,245 --> 01:22:31,408
Si (yes).

1074
01:22:31,327 --> 01:22:33,939
We missiles, machine guns.

1075
01:22:33,940 --> 01:22:36,284
We fight Van, we fight Torrez.

1076
01:22:36,285 --> 01:22:38,332
We take em' all down at once.

1077
01:22:38,947 --> 01:22:39,924
Hey everyone!

1078
01:22:40,399 --> 01:22:40,807
Listen UP!

1079
01:22:40,808 --> 01:22:41,851
Now we got some work to do!

1080
01:22:50,648 --> 01:22:51,690
Does anyone knows who's Machete?

1081
01:22:52,464 --> 01:22:53,507
Does anyone knows who's Machete?

1082
01:22:55,512 --> 01:22:56,556
Please.

1083
01:22:57,091 --> 01:22:58,494
Machete needs your help

1084
01:22:58,495 --> 01:23:00,210
or he'll be killed just like Luz,

1085
01:23:00,211 --> 01:23:01,254
just like Padre (Father).

1086
01:23:05,824 --> 01:23:06,995
Listen to me!

1087
01:23:08,248 --> 01:23:10,648
Yes, I am a woman of the law,

1088
01:23:10,649 --> 01:23:13,123
and there are lots of laws!

1089
01:23:13,706 --> 01:23:15,493
But if they don't offer us justice,

1090
01:23:15,494 --> 01:23:17,455
Then they aren't law!

1091
01:23:18,371 --> 01:23:20,113
They are just lines drawn in the sand

1092
01:23:20,114 --> 01:23:22,541
by men who would stand on your backs.

1093
01:23:22,990 --> 01:23:24,298
For power and glory.

1094
01:23:24,747 --> 01:23:27,689
Men who deserves to be cut down.

1095
01:23:29,339 --> 01:23:31,396
It's time to erase the meyette the line!

1096
01:23:32,485 --> 01:23:34,710
And show these cabronese
the true meaning of true law!

1097
01:23:36,463 --> 01:23:37,863
We didn't cross the border.

1098
01:23:37,864 --> 01:23:41,066
The border crossed us!

1099
01:23:41,928 --> 01:23:43,254
Viva la (long live) Machete!

1100
01:23:44,373 --> 01:23:45,982
Viva la (long live) Machete!

1101
01:23:47,010 --> 01:23:48,347
You’re Machete's girl.

1102
01:23:48,348 --> 01:23:49,534
I know,

1103
01:23:49,535 --> 01:23:51,466
Unless you're his type.

1104
01:23:51,822 --> 01:23:52,852
What type is that?

1105
01:23:54,039 --> 01:23:55,947
Dead.

1106
01:24:08,590 --> 01:24:11,450
<i>Earlier today, Senator
McLaughlin allegedly pulled a gun,</i>

1107
01:24:11,451 --> 01:24:13,047
<i>on his advisor Michael Booth.</i>

1108
01:24:13,577 --> 01:24:15,170
<i>And shot him twice in the chest.</i>

1109
01:24:15,171 --> 01:24:17,627
<i>After an altercation
following the disaster reveal</i>

1110
01:24:17,628 --> 01:24:19,840
<i>earlier this afternoon. Of the senator's</i>

1111
01:24:19,841 --> 01:24:20,883
<i>connections to the</i>

1112
01:24:20,525 --> 01:24:22,327
<i>Mexican drug king pin Rogelio Torrez.</i>

1113
01:24:22,517 --> 01:24:23,913
Network!

1114
01:24:23,430 --> 01:24:24,482
<i>According to recent reports,</i>

1115
01:24:24,483 --> 01:24:27,458
<i>McLaughlin's re-election
campaign was been funded</i>

1116
01:24:27,459 --> 01:24:29,400
<i>entirely by Mr. Torrez.</i>

1117
01:24:30,085 --> 01:24:30,999
Machete!

1118
01:24:32,858 --> 01:24:35,920
Networks said the senator calling
the vigilantes to kill you.

1119
01:24:36,410 --> 01:24:37,519
And Agent Santana,

1120
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:39,619
she's been captured by Torrez!

1121
01:24:40,775 --> 01:24:43,498
All hands and the armory to load up.

1122
01:24:43,883 --> 01:24:45,512
Time to roll out!

1123
01:25:51,947 --> 01:25:53,300
Give me a vest and a rifle.

1124
01:25:57,809 --> 01:25:59,460
My great grand daddy...

1125
01:25:59,461 --> 01:26:02,328
did not give his life at at
The Alamo so that we could

1126
01:26:02,329 --> 01:26:06,093
sell off our nation to some
backstabbing politicians.

1127
01:26:06,499 --> 01:26:07,400
What are you talking about?

1128
01:26:07,913 --> 01:26:09,105
You lied to us,

1129
01:26:09,106 --> 01:26:11,262
you paid that Mexican to put on an act.

1130
01:26:11,263 --> 01:26:12,306
To fool the people.

1131
01:26:12,964 --> 01:26:14,627
And my pool of posse.

1132
01:26:14,886 --> 01:26:15,799
Now he's on his way...

1133
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:18,327
And no doubt bringing a
whole mess of bean eaters.

1134
01:26:18,952 --> 01:26:21,710
You seem to be quite
fond of Booth, Senator.

1135
01:26:21,459 --> 01:26:23,566
You've been in the
desert too long amigo...

1136
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:25,657
Well let's see just how
this blows your skirt up?

1137
01:26:26,170 --> 01:26:30,075
We're gonna simulcast your
execution for the crime of treason.

1138
01:26:33,981 --> 01:26:35,768
No shit stains.

1139
01:26:38,917 --> 01:26:40,623
Guys! They're on their way!

1140
01:26:41,393 --> 01:26:42,395
Get to your posts!

1141
01:26:54,474 --> 01:26:55,904
Time for your last testament.

1142
01:26:58,189 --> 01:27:00,574
No second takes.

1143
01:27:00,942 --> 01:27:02,274
Just get your lines right.

1144
01:27:30,604 --> 01:27:32,059
Hold the line...

1145
01:27:35,767 --> 01:27:41,066
I have desecrated the
oath of our first...

1146
01:27:41,714 --> 01:27:45,622
and I am a traitor deserving death.

1147
01:27:45,657 --> 01:27:46,650
Ready?

1148
01:27:48,688 --> 01:27:50,005
Fucking parasites!

1149
01:27:50,534 --> 01:27:51,929
Fucking terrorists!

1150
01:27:53,106 --> 01:27:54,910
Aim.

1151
01:28:12,157 --> 01:28:13,587
Shit

1152
01:28:13,551 --> 01:28:14,355
Two of you stay with him...

1153
01:28:14,356 --> 01:28:15,399
The rest of you outside.

1154
01:28:24,638 --> 01:28:26,546
Oh shit!

1155
01:28:31,793 --> 01:28:33,830
Fuck em up!

1156
01:30:14,965 --> 01:30:15,966
How is your eye?

1157
01:30:15,967 --> 01:30:16,970
What eye?

1158
01:31:01,482 --> 01:31:03,217
If you want to survive your own war,

1159
01:31:03,218 --> 01:31:05,626
you better become Mexican real fast.

1160
01:31:09,060 --> 01:31:11,586
You got enemies on all sides, Senator.

1161
01:31:13,648 --> 01:31:15,962
Who can you trust?

1162
01:31:15,936 --> 01:31:18,000
You aim to take down those boys?

1163
01:31:20,261 --> 01:31:21,403
Then I'm with you.

1164
01:31:55,223 --> 01:31:57,771
Take out that Mexican!

1165
01:31:58,789 --> 01:32:00,038
God Dammit!

1166
01:32:10,079 --> 01:32:12,500
Van, we're fucked! We
gotta get outta here.

1167
01:32:12,501 --> 01:32:13,545
Get outta here!

1168
01:32:32,235 --> 01:32:33,284
Sister...

1169
01:32:34,003 --> 01:32:35,132
Please...

1170
01:32:36,614 --> 01:32:37,640
I've done wrong...

1171
01:32:38,292 --> 01:32:39,335
I've done terrible this life...

1172
01:32:40,216 --> 01:32:41,765
And I'm not even from here I hate Texas.

1173
01:32:41,766 --> 01:32:42,808
I hate the heat.

1174
01:32:43,623 --> 01:32:45,227
Give me my last rites.

1175
01:32:47,806 --> 01:32:50,638
In the name of my father.

1176
01:32:51,213 --> 01:32:52,292
My father...

1177
01:32:53,833 --> 01:32:55,047
April.

1178
01:33:02,124 --> 01:33:03,132
Forgot the rest.

1179
01:34:03,544 --> 01:34:05,603
You never learn to stay
down! Punieta (jerk off).

1180
01:34:06,297 --> 01:34:08,072
So I guess I have to teach you.

1181
01:34:12,497 --> 01:34:14,101
Got something to say?

1182
01:34:17,670 --> 01:34:19,574
Now you got something to say?

1183
01:34:30,276 --> 01:34:32,481
Back the fuck up and watch.

1184
01:34:35,984 --> 01:34:37,075
Okay Punieta!

1185
01:34:37,954 --> 01:34:39,159
Adelante (Forward).

1186
01:34:54,397 --> 01:34:56,481
We used to be federale's
together kanna (root),

1187
01:34:56,482 --> 01:34:57,525
Remember?

1188
01:35:02,775 --> 01:35:03,688
We were brothers...

1189
01:35:04,726 --> 01:35:05,509
But you?

1190
01:35:05,510 --> 01:35:07,687
went for the honor.

1191
01:35:07,688 --> 01:35:09,331
Pendejo (coward).

1192
01:35:18,650 --> 01:35:20,137
Then I went for the power.

1193
01:35:22,135 --> 01:35:24,339
We killed a lot of bad guys together.

1194
01:35:26,481 --> 01:35:28,184
Now I'm the bad guy.

1195
01:35:29,592 --> 01:35:31,196
What do you wanna do?
hermanito (little brother)?

1196
01:35:42,959 --> 01:35:45,263
Look at your Machete now. Cabrón

1197
01:35:49,712 --> 01:35:50,914
He's gonna kill him.

1198
01:35:52,699 --> 01:35:54,202
No he's not.

1199
01:35:56,006 --> 01:35:57,209
He's Machete.

1200
01:36:02,019 --> 01:36:03,221
No point.

1201
01:36:12,667 --> 01:36:13,829
Cap Puto (fuck).

1202
01:36:15,997 --> 01:36:19,206
You know I could kill
you now very easily.

1203
01:36:20,234 --> 01:36:21,168
Believe me.

1204
01:36:21,973 --> 01:36:23,575
This is nothing.

1205
01:36:25,981 --> 01:36:27,584
This ain't shit.

1206
01:36:28,079 --> 01:36:29,081
But...

1207
01:36:31,293 --> 01:36:35,000
I know you'll just be
waiting for me in hell.

1208
01:36:35,101 --> 01:36:38,008
So...

1209
01:36:40,013 --> 01:36:41,215
I think I'll say goodbye.

1210
01:36:44,933 --> 01:36:46,204
Fuck it.

1211
01:38:17,689 --> 01:38:18,692
There's one!

1212
01:38:20,077 --> 01:38:21,639
God damn cockroach

1213
01:38:34,152 --> 01:38:35,806
Can't speak english. Can you boy?

1214
01:38:40,159 --> 01:38:41,490
Welcome to America.

1215
01:39:31,426 --> 01:39:32,963
What? You wanna see my ID?

1216
01:39:32,964 --> 01:39:34,008
Don't bother.

1217
01:39:35,428 --> 01:39:36,750
I've got something better.

1218
01:39:39,595 --> 01:39:40,699
I called in a few favours.

1219
01:39:40,700 --> 01:39:41,743
Look at this.

1220
01:39:42,409 --> 01:39:43,943
Got you all the right papers.

1221
01:39:44,954 --> 01:39:46,401
You can start over now.

1222
01:39:47,171 --> 01:39:48,573
Be a real person.

1223
01:39:49,157 --> 01:39:50,692
Why do I want to be a real person?

1224
01:39:52,176 --> 01:39:53,980
I'm already a myth.

1225
01:39:55,001 --> 01:39:56,203
Where will you go?

1226
01:39:58,375 --> 01:40:00,277
Everywhere.

1227
01:40:04,770 --> 01:40:06,675
Can I ride with you?
