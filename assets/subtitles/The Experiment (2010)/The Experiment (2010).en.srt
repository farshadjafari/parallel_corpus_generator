1
00:02:45,078 --> 00:02:47,444
- You suck, Gertrude.
- You suck.

2
00:02:47,514 --> 00:02:50,176
Yeah, I suck so bad I just skunked you.

3
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,151
Which means, you gotta eat your pills.

4
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,553
- You're supposed to be nice to me.
- I am nice to you.

5
00:02:56,923 --> 00:03:00,552
- It's not my fault you got no game.
- You suck, Travis.

6
00:03:03,597 --> 00:03:04,723
I know.

7
00:03:05,465 --> 00:03:07,194
Hey there, Travis.

8
00:03:07,901 --> 00:03:10,301
- I'll check on you later.
- All right.

9
00:03:11,638 --> 00:03:12,627
<i>Travis,</i>

10
00:03:14,241 --> 00:03:17,574
you've been talking about seeing the world

11
00:03:17,644 --> 00:03:19,976
the whole time you've been here.

12
00:03:21,314 --> 00:03:25,614
Think of it as an opportunity to
finally fulfill that.

13
00:03:25,886 --> 00:03:30,186
- Well, then you're firing me.
- Not firing, laying off.

14
00:03:30,257 --> 00:03:33,420
And I'm not laying you off,
the state is laying you off.

15
00:03:33,493 --> 00:03:35,154
All these budget cuts.

16
00:03:35,228 --> 00:03:37,423
They're clear-cutting the part-time positions.

17
00:03:37,497 --> 00:03:39,897
This has nothing to do with you.

18
00:03:39,966 --> 00:03:42,093
My advice, Travis, go see the world.

19
00:03:42,168 --> 00:03:44,932
Get that out of your system
like you've always wanted.

20
00:03:45,005 --> 00:03:47,132
Maybe you come back,
they may be hiring again.

21
00:03:47,207 --> 00:03:49,072
<i>- Home! Bring them home!</i>
<i>- Home! Bring them home!</i>

22
00:03:49,142 --> 00:03:51,542
- Bring them home!
- Bring them home!

23
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:53,977
- Bring them home! Bring them home!
- Bring them home! Bring them home!

24
00:03:54,047 --> 00:03:56,277
- Bring them home! Bring them home!
- Bring them home! Bring them home!

25
00:03:56,349 --> 00:04:00,183
- I can't believe they fired me yesterday.
- Come on, man. It was a nursing home.

26
00:04:00,253 --> 00:04:03,279
- It's a retirement home.
- Yeah, that's what I said. A nursing home.

27
00:04:03,356 --> 00:04:04,755
It's better for the world than insurance.

28
00:04:04,824 --> 00:04:07,884
- Hey, I'm carrying a sign, aren't I?
- Great.

29
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:10,088
Listen, not to get new-agey or nothing,

30
00:04:10,163 --> 00:04:12,757
but I think this is something that
was supposed to happen to you, you know?

31
00:04:12,832 --> 00:04:15,665
Force you out of your comfort zone,
make you mix it up a little bit.

32
00:04:15,735 --> 00:04:18,533
- I don't need to mix it up, I need to get paid.
- Get innovative then, man.

33
00:04:18,605 --> 00:04:20,163
Don't tell me you don't know how to do that.

34
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,902
Back in college when you were
doing all that test subject shit.

35
00:04:22,976 --> 00:04:24,637
Selling your sperm.

36
00:04:25,178 --> 00:04:27,146
I never sold my sperm.

37
00:04:27,747 --> 00:04:32,116
'Cause nobody in their right mind
would pay for a piece of those genes.

38
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:33,784
You know what?

39
00:04:33,853 --> 00:04:37,414
Whoever said peace rallies is
where the action is, doesn't know shit.

40
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:41,290
- This is a fucking dyke-fest.
- Not all of them.

41
00:04:43,964 --> 00:04:45,454
No. Not happening.

42
00:04:49,536 --> 00:04:50,560
What's happening?

43
00:04:56,309 --> 00:04:59,335
- Hey. Hey!
- I got friends out there, you son of a bitch!

44
00:04:59,412 --> 00:05:01,778
- Fucking liberal pussy!
- Enough.

45
00:05:01,848 --> 00:05:03,873
- Get your fucking hands off me, man.
- Enough! Enough!

46
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,384
Guys like me go over there
and die for a living.

47
00:05:06,453 --> 00:05:09,388
- Hey!
- Tee off, go ahead.

48
00:05:09,456 --> 00:05:13,153
It's your issue, man. It's your issue, man.
Not mine.

49
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,984
Come on.

50
00:05:15,061 --> 00:05:16,221
- Hypocrite!
- Let's go.

51
00:05:16,296 --> 00:05:20,790
Fucking hypocrite! Go on!
Spread all your lies!

52
00:05:21,134 --> 00:05:24,365
You got a captive audience,
you fucking hippie liberal!

53
00:05:24,437 --> 00:05:27,634
Go on,
with all your propaganda and diatribes.

54
00:05:36,983 --> 00:05:38,177
Thanks.

55
00:05:38,718 --> 00:05:42,279
- You okay?
- Yeah, you?

56
00:05:43,657 --> 00:05:45,358
I'm all right.

57
00:05:46,059 --> 00:05:49,722
My dad sat me down
and had me watch <i>Red Dawn</i>

58
00:05:49,796 --> 00:05:52,390
so that I would understand
just how bad things would get

59
00:05:52,465 --> 00:05:54,456
if the Communists took over.

60
00:05:55,001 --> 00:05:56,992
I sort of dug that flick.

61
00:05:58,505 --> 00:06:02,373
Then it was narco-traffickers,
Islamo-Fascists.

62
00:06:02,676 --> 00:06:06,043
Bad guys just keep changing their faces
and we keep going to war.

63
00:06:06,112 --> 00:06:08,478
- And then...
- We keep protesting.

64
00:06:09,315 --> 00:06:12,751
- United we stand.
- Cheers.

65
00:06:17,157 --> 00:06:19,352
This is a big moment, Travis.

66
00:06:21,428 --> 00:06:26,127
You've just witnessed
the last anti-war diatribe

67
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:28,394
- the world's ever gonna hear from me.
- Wow.

68
00:06:28,468 --> 00:06:32,199
You know what I've realized?
Real war's in here.

69
00:06:32,806 --> 00:06:35,297
You just figured that out?

70
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:38,037
No, I've known it for a while.

71
00:06:38,111 --> 00:06:42,047
- But I'm finally gonna do something about it.
- And what's that?

72
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:46,214
I'm going to India.

73
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,386
I figure I'll do some yoga,

74
00:06:49,456 --> 00:06:51,947
some time in an ashram,

75
00:06:52,025 --> 00:06:53,925
have sex with my guru.

76
00:06:58,131 --> 00:07:00,793
We'll both agree afterwards that
it was a mistake, of course.

77
00:07:00,867 --> 00:07:02,425
Of course.

78
00:07:06,272 --> 00:07:09,901
Maybe you should go. We could meet up.

79
00:07:09,976 --> 00:07:14,913
Well, a trip like that
would be a pretty penny,

80
00:07:14,981 --> 00:07:17,449
- which I don't got.
- Could knock over a liquor store.

81
00:07:19,285 --> 00:07:22,516
I think I could come up with something
slightly more legit.

82
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:24,821
Such as?

83
00:07:25,058 --> 00:07:26,855
You don't wanna know.

84
00:07:28,261 --> 00:07:29,853
I think I can handle it.

85
00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:33,558
I mean, I think I'm intellectually
limber enough.

86
00:07:35,635 --> 00:07:37,398
Can I see you again?

87
00:08:16,676 --> 00:08:19,668
- Michael Barris.
- Travis, hey.

88
00:08:21,915 --> 00:08:24,816
- Smart man.
- What?

89
00:08:26,052 --> 00:08:29,419
- You wore a suit. That's a smart move.
- Yeah.

90
00:08:29,489 --> 00:08:33,152
- I heard there's not many spots.
- Do I need to sign here or print my name?

91
00:08:33,226 --> 00:08:36,093
- Just a signature will do.
- Thanks, boo. Love the jacket.

92
00:08:38,765 --> 00:08:41,495
We are strangers in a strange land, brother.

93
00:08:43,369 --> 00:08:46,532
First off, what we will be doing here,
for those of you that don't know,

94
00:08:46,606 --> 00:08:50,770
will be a behavioral experiment,
in which we will be simulating

95
00:08:50,844 --> 00:08:53,972
the conditions of life
inside a state penitentiary.

96
00:08:54,047 --> 00:08:57,312
Now, our only requirement is that
none of you have ever served any time.

97
00:08:57,383 --> 00:08:59,783
If you have, we'd like to
thank you for your interest,

98
00:08:59,853 --> 00:09:01,548
but you do not fit our profile.

99
00:09:01,621 --> 00:09:04,818
Now, we will be conducting
a short series of tests in a moment,

100
00:09:04,891 --> 00:09:06,984
but before we do
I would just like to take a beat

101
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:10,461
and let you know that
although the actual experiment

102
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:13,260
will be conducted
in an utterly secure environment

103
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:16,325
and the participants will be safe at all times,

104
00:09:16,402 --> 00:09:19,667
some of the subjects
will be deprived of their civil rights...

105
00:09:19,739 --> 00:09:22,037
- It's a flying man.
...for the entire two weeks.

106
00:09:22,108 --> 00:09:24,338
What's his name?

107
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:28,574
- Flying Man.
- Now, let's get to the tests, shall we?

108
00:09:29,249 --> 00:09:31,649
- No history of incarceration?
- No.

109
00:09:33,052 --> 00:09:35,213
- Violence?
- No.

110
00:09:35,455 --> 00:09:37,980
- Never?
- No.

111
00:09:40,693 --> 00:09:44,220
- What about religion?
- No.

112
00:09:45,198 --> 00:09:49,225
No? Religion's not usually
a yes or no question, Mr. Hunt.

113
00:09:49,302 --> 00:09:53,363
People tend to find all sorts of gray areas
in which to couch their answers.

114
00:09:53,439 --> 00:09:55,600
Well, nothing gray here.

115
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,810
So, how do you base
your ethical decisions, then?

116
00:10:01,848 --> 00:10:02,837
Here.

117
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:07,580
I was in Boy Scouts,
and drill team in high school,

118
00:10:10,123 --> 00:10:11,283
various church groups.

119
00:10:11,357 --> 00:10:14,155
- You were devout, then?
- Still am.

120
00:10:14,894 --> 00:10:18,455
And what about
absolute right and wrong in the universe?

121
00:10:22,735 --> 00:10:24,600
Well, I guess,

122
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:31,404
if I believe in God,
then I would have to, right?

123
00:10:32,045 --> 00:10:35,037
Yeah, you know, I only got three rules,

124
00:10:35,114 --> 00:10:39,676
eat twat, smoke pot, and smile a lot.

125
00:10:45,325 --> 00:10:47,384
It's just a short slide-show
we'd like you to watch.

126
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,792
It's perfectly safe, I assure you.

127
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:05,701
<i>The sheriff's deputies had escorted</i>
<i>Duceppe back to Baton Rouge.</i>

128
00:11:05,778 --> 00:11:08,906
<i>I am convinced that</i>
<i>when these animals are herded together</i>

129
00:11:08,982 --> 00:11:10,609
<i>their instincts warn them of...</i>

130
00:11:11,284 --> 00:11:13,616
<i>... California hotel, where FBI agents...</i>

131
00:12:00,266 --> 00:12:04,100
- Are you okay to move on, Mr. Hunt?
- Yep. I'm good.

132
00:12:29,495 --> 00:12:31,520
You wouldn't have hit him.

133
00:12:32,665 --> 00:12:33,654
Who?

134
00:12:35,001 --> 00:12:36,798
The guy at the rally.

135
00:12:39,672 --> 00:12:41,970
You wouldn't have hit him.

136
00:12:43,342 --> 00:12:46,641
These knuckles, they're pristine.

137
00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:51,674
- You calling me a pussy?
- Yeah.

138
00:12:55,421 --> 00:12:58,913
- It's a compliment.
- Cool.

139
00:13:02,128 --> 00:13:05,188
I'll be gone by the time
you get out, you know.

140
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:07,493
I know.

141
00:13:19,512 --> 00:13:23,004
Dashashwamedh Ghat, Varanasi.

142
00:13:24,784 --> 00:13:28,515
- Varanasi.
- How soon can you be there?

143
00:13:30,623 --> 00:13:33,786
Twelfth? Thirteenth?

144
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,827
Thirteenth.

145
00:13:36,729 --> 00:13:40,893
Dashashwamedh Ghat on the 13th, 6:00 p.m.

146
00:13:46,272 --> 00:13:49,435
- Hey, you made it.
- Good to see you.

147
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:51,739
- Yeah.
- I was hoping I'd have someone to talk to.

148
00:13:53,713 --> 00:13:57,240
I can't help but think that
this says something about us.

149
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,915
I think it says we need money.

150
00:14:04,557 --> 00:14:07,549
- Sorry.
- Hey, how's it going?

151
00:14:20,673 --> 00:14:23,972
- It's the beginning.
- Game on.

152
00:14:25,077 --> 00:14:28,444
So let's move on to the topic of women.
What's that word mean to you?

153
00:14:28,514 --> 00:14:30,004
Women? What?

154
00:14:41,327 --> 00:14:43,761
Everything on God's green earth

155
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:47,390
and possibly beyond what's been
discovered in our universe yet?

156
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:48,490
I don't know.

157
00:15:05,718 --> 00:15:09,017
<i>Look, it's only a dog.</i>
<i>So, what're you worried about?</i>

158
00:15:09,088 --> 00:15:11,022
<i>Worried? Who's worried?</i>
<i>I'm only worried about you.</i>

159
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:14,116
<i>Look, I'll stay here and protect the car,</i>
<i>and you go take a look.</i>

160
00:15:20,766 --> 00:15:24,133
Hey, chickenshit, we got a draft!

161
00:15:25,504 --> 00:15:27,836
Didn't you hear me, chickenshit?

162
00:15:28,641 --> 00:15:31,132
We got a draft. Close the window!

163
00:16:16,789 --> 00:16:18,518
I fell asleep. How far did we drive?

164
00:16:25,064 --> 00:16:26,964
This is a fucking spot.

165
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:31,359
Gentlemen, they're waiting inside.

166
00:16:31,437 --> 00:16:35,100
You mind if I just grab my bag?
There's some stuff in there that I need.

167
00:16:35,174 --> 00:16:38,302
You'll have everything you need inside.

168
00:16:52,191 --> 00:16:54,091
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

169
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,221
The next two weeks
will be a new experience for you.

170
00:16:58,898 --> 00:17:02,334
Now as I said before,
some of you will have no civil rights.

171
00:17:02,535 --> 00:17:04,969
Do not underestimate that.

172
00:17:05,604 --> 00:17:08,732
If any of you wanna leave,
now is your last chance.

173
00:17:10,042 --> 00:17:11,566
No?

174
00:17:14,847 --> 00:17:16,439
Good.

175
00:17:16,515 --> 00:17:19,780
Again, your safety is
our number one priority.

176
00:17:19,852 --> 00:17:22,946
If there is any violence, any at all,

177
00:17:23,022 --> 00:17:26,355
the experiment
will be immediately terminated.

178
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:27,919
Clear?

179
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,956
Now, when I call your name, please stand.

180
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:33,828
Dernier, Bosch,

181
00:17:34,667 --> 00:17:38,194
Helweg, Sandberg,

182
00:17:39,705 --> 00:17:43,141
Chase, and Barris.

183
00:17:46,078 --> 00:17:47,102
Good.

184
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:51,275
So the rest of you,
please stand up and follow the yellow line.

185
00:17:53,953 --> 00:17:56,444
- Later, pal.
- Good luck, gentlemen. And I thank you.

186
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:05,187
So what do you think, Girl Scouts?
Prisoners or guards?

187
00:18:07,566 --> 00:18:09,227
I think we just got our answer.

188
00:18:12,471 --> 00:18:15,702
Nothing is to come or go from the cell block.

189
00:18:15,775 --> 00:18:17,902
Nothing from the outside world.

190
00:18:18,244 --> 00:18:22,340
If you look in your lockers,
you will see a printout with the five rules

191
00:18:22,415 --> 00:18:24,747
that the prisoners are to follow at all times.

192
00:18:24,817 --> 00:18:26,580
Please read them aloud with me.

193
00:18:26,852 --> 00:18:28,319
"Rule number one:

194
00:18:28,387 --> 00:18:32,949
"Prisoners must eat three meals a day
and all food must be consumed.

195
00:18:33,025 --> 00:18:36,051
"Two: There will be 30 minutes of rec daily.

196
00:18:36,128 --> 00:18:41,191
"Three: Prisoners are allowed only
in prisoner-designated areas.

197
00:18:41,267 --> 00:18:45,294
"Four: Prisoners must speak
only when spoken to.

198
00:18:45,371 --> 00:18:51,071
"And five: Prisoners must not touch
the guards under any circumstances."

199
00:18:51,777 --> 00:18:55,770
Those that break the rules
must be punished commensurately.

200
00:18:56,382 --> 00:18:58,043
What does "commensurate" mean?

201
00:18:58,918 --> 00:19:01,819
This experiment is not about individuals.

202
00:19:01,887 --> 00:19:04,651
If any one person leaves, it's over.

203
00:19:04,723 --> 00:19:06,691
If a prisoner does break the rules,

204
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:10,320
you will have 30 minutes to choose
proper disciplinary action.

205
00:19:10,396 --> 00:19:13,388
If you fail to do so,
that red light will come on,

206
00:19:13,466 --> 00:19:17,300
the experiment will be terminated,
and you will not get paid.

207
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:21,037
- What did you say?
- You either maintain strict order,

208
00:19:21,106 --> 00:19:23,267
or you don't get paid.

209
00:19:23,943 --> 00:19:26,070
I will see you in two weeks.

210
00:19:46,232 --> 00:19:48,894
- Sorry, man.
- For what?

211
00:19:49,602 --> 00:19:51,627
- All this.
- Don't sweat it.

212
00:19:54,006 --> 00:19:56,497
All right, turn around. Gotta do the front.

213
00:19:56,575 --> 00:19:58,839
What? Nobody else had to turn around.

214
00:19:58,911 --> 00:20:00,845
What's the problem, Boy George,

215
00:20:00,913 --> 00:20:03,404
you afraid we gonna see that
you got no dick?

216
00:20:03,482 --> 00:20:06,383
- Fuck you.
- Hey, man. Quit being a fag, huh?

217
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,387
Maybe if we drop the soap...

218
00:20:10,956 --> 00:20:14,414
All right, girls. Everyone on the line!

219
00:20:14,994 --> 00:20:18,122
- Which one?
- I don't know.

220
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:21,993
That one. That line.

221
00:20:24,203 --> 00:20:26,034
- How you doing?
- Gotta be honest,

222
00:20:26,105 --> 00:20:29,768
you guys are the most suck-ass guards
I've ever seen.

223
00:20:33,345 --> 00:20:36,746
Yeah, well, you can blow me
and the entire state of Kentucky.

224
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:38,777
Kentucky?

225
00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:41,680
All right, look, we gotta stop fucking around

226
00:20:41,754 --> 00:20:44,279
or they might end this thing
before it even begins.

227
00:20:45,057 --> 00:20:47,457
I didn't come all the way out here
not to get paid.

228
00:20:49,562 --> 00:20:53,931
"From now on inmates will be addressed
only by their inmate numbers."

229
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,891
That's awesome.

230
00:20:58,537 --> 00:20:59,526
Wow.

231
00:20:59,805 --> 00:21:02,672
The only other thing
that you girls need to know

232
00:21:02,741 --> 00:21:08,976
is, "Prisoners will find cell assignments
attached to each cell."

233
00:21:09,848 --> 00:21:13,409
- Are we supposed to do that?
- Yes, Tinker Bell.

234
00:21:13,485 --> 00:21:14,577
- Now?
- Yes.

235
00:21:15,287 --> 00:21:17,619
Now run along. Run along, find your homes.

236
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,419
- Okay.
- Going.

237
00:21:19,491 --> 00:21:22,517
- Okay, guys...
- This ain't a love-in. Get moving.

238
00:21:22,995 --> 00:21:25,429
Waiting for a bus? Come on!

239
00:21:30,836 --> 00:21:32,997
Hey, Travis.

240
00:21:38,677 --> 00:21:40,076
Seventeen.

241
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,545
Seventy-seven.

242
00:21:47,953 --> 00:21:52,219
Wow, I feel dangerous
just wearing this outfit.

243
00:21:52,825 --> 00:21:54,622
- You look dangerous.
- Oh, yeah.

244
00:21:54,693 --> 00:21:57,628
Yeah, you are massively
messing with me, right?

245
00:21:57,696 --> 00:21:59,095
- No.
- No?

246
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:02,490
- Benjy Putterman.
- How you doing? Travis.

247
00:22:02,835 --> 00:22:03,824
Novelist.

248
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,840
- Novelist, huh?
- Graphic novelist, actually.

249
00:22:13,612 --> 00:22:17,309
- Comics.
- Graphic novels.

250
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:21,608
Oh, my God, I'm gonna get so much material
from this place.

251
00:22:21,687 --> 00:22:24,986
- This is ripping!
- Yeah.

252
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,294
Ripping.

253
00:22:29,695 --> 00:22:32,459
So, what drew you to this experiment?

254
00:22:34,466 --> 00:22:36,195
Cash-dollars.

255
00:22:36,702 --> 00:22:37,964
My mother.

256
00:22:39,304 --> 00:22:41,534
It was her idea?

257
00:22:43,475 --> 00:22:44,840
She broke her hip,

258
00:22:46,378 --> 00:22:47,868
I needed to pay the rent.

259
00:22:47,946 --> 00:22:49,436
Do you live with your mother?

260
00:22:49,782 --> 00:22:50,874
Yes.

261
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,713
And how old are you?

262
00:22:54,953 --> 00:22:56,011
Forty-two.

263
00:22:56,655 --> 00:22:59,317
So, what drew you
to this experiment, Mr. Chase?

264
00:22:59,391 --> 00:23:02,383
Pussy. Pussy drew me to the experiment.

265
00:23:02,628 --> 00:23:05,597
It's a male-only experiment, Mr. Chase.

266
00:23:05,664 --> 00:23:09,065
It's the pussy I'm gonna get
with the 14 grand once I'm done.

267
00:23:09,134 --> 00:23:11,034
How many sexual partners have you had?

268
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:16,239
I lost track when I was, like, 17.

269
00:23:16,842 --> 00:23:19,072
Were they male or female?

270
00:23:19,945 --> 00:23:21,037
Female.

271
00:23:21,613 --> 00:23:24,639
So, what drew you to
this experiment, Mr. Nix?

272
00:23:24,883 --> 00:23:27,477
I'm just trying to make an honest buck, man.

273
00:23:28,554 --> 00:23:29,543
Escape.

274
00:23:30,656 --> 00:23:32,317
Come on, you big boy.

275
00:23:32,825 --> 00:23:34,349
Throw it down.

276
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:39,722
Seventy-seven.

277
00:23:39,932 --> 00:23:41,695
- Flying Man?
- No.

278
00:23:42,468 --> 00:23:43,901
You guys go ahead.

279
00:23:43,969 --> 00:23:46,301
Oh, hell no. These knees are busted.

280
00:23:47,272 --> 00:23:49,331
Hey, how about it, redwood? Throw it down?

281
00:23:53,011 --> 00:23:54,740
- Wait.
- Oh, my God. Is he okay?

282
00:23:57,349 --> 00:24:00,648
- I'm sorry.
- Fuck.

283
00:24:01,553 --> 00:24:03,885
- Bosch, you all right?
- I'm all right.

284
00:24:03,989 --> 00:24:06,457
- Let's get you out of here.
- I thought he was looking.

285
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:08,649
- Come on.
- I did.

286
00:24:09,461 --> 00:24:12,362
- You all right, big man. You all right.
- It's all right. It was an accident.

287
00:24:13,198 --> 00:24:14,358
It's all right.

288
00:24:19,204 --> 00:24:22,367
What the fuck was that guy thinking, huh?

289
00:24:22,441 --> 00:24:25,376
I'm okay. I'm okay. He didn't mean it.

290
00:24:25,911 --> 00:24:28,141
- Sure you're all right?
- It's just a bloody nose.

291
00:24:28,747 --> 00:24:31,648
Let's just go back to work. Please.

292
00:24:33,152 --> 00:24:35,620
I don't know.

293
00:24:35,687 --> 00:24:39,179
- I think we gotta do something.
- What are you talking about?

294
00:24:39,258 --> 00:24:42,125
I'm talking about rule number five.

295
00:24:43,495 --> 00:24:45,087
Prisoners are not supposed to touch us.

296
00:24:45,864 --> 00:24:50,324
Well, technically, he didn't touch us.
The ball did.

297
00:24:50,569 --> 00:24:52,400
Look at your face, man.

298
00:24:53,872 --> 00:24:57,330
I mean, we all heard what they said.
We gotta keep the order.

299
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:00,401
Respond commensurately.

300
00:25:02,047 --> 00:25:05,380
They saw it. They know it was an accident.

301
00:25:05,784 --> 00:25:09,618
- I agree.
- Are you sure about that?

302
00:25:10,722 --> 00:25:13,054
Look, I just don't want that light
to come on in 30 minutes

303
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:15,059
because we didn't do what
we were supposed to do.

304
00:25:15,127 --> 00:25:17,687
- I got 14 grand on the line.
- Yeah, we all got 14 grand on the line.

305
00:25:17,763 --> 00:25:19,492
Come on.

306
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:23,197
We're not talking about
crucifying the man here.

307
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:28,262
The word's commensurate.

308
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:31,066
Which means,

309
00:25:31,143 --> 00:25:34,579
if what the man did was small potatoes,

310
00:25:36,215 --> 00:25:38,308
we respond in kind.

311
00:25:38,383 --> 00:25:41,216
Small potatoes for small potatoes.

312
00:25:41,887 --> 00:25:43,286
Either that,

313
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:47,458
or we wait till that light goes on.

314
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:57,291
Push-ups, ten.

315
00:25:58,403 --> 00:26:00,234
Do them now.

316
00:26:01,607 --> 00:26:04,770
I just need a little civility, that's all.

317
00:26:05,978 --> 00:26:08,469
It was an accident.

318
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,417
This is not a fucking negotiation.
Do the push-ups.

319
00:26:19,725 --> 00:26:23,320
Just a little civility, brother. Just a little.

320
00:26:26,865 --> 00:26:31,165
All right, everyone, ten push-ups.

321
00:26:37,643 --> 00:26:40,544
You heard the man. Let's go.

322
00:26:41,179 --> 00:26:44,444
Do it! Come on, do it!

323
00:26:44,816 --> 00:26:46,340
Yeah, follow your little brother.

324
00:26:48,487 --> 00:26:50,045
There we are.

325
00:26:50,856 --> 00:26:51,948
Count them out.

326
00:26:52,024 --> 00:26:55,289
- One, two, three...
- One, two, three...

327
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,329
...four, five, six...
...four, five, six...

328
00:26:58,397 --> 00:27:02,094
...seven, eight, nine, ten.
...seven, eight, nine, ten.

329
00:27:02,167 --> 00:27:06,570
What did that tell you, huh?
Tater Tots for Tater Tots.

330
00:27:07,172 --> 00:27:09,640
And you, you ought to be a cop, dude.

331
00:27:10,008 --> 00:27:12,875
- Looked more like a drill sergeant to me.
- Yeah.

332
00:27:12,945 --> 00:27:15,379
Like that guy out of <i>Full Metal Jacket.</i>

333
00:27:15,447 --> 00:27:18,416
- "Give me 20, maggot!"
- Fuck you.

334
00:27:18,483 --> 00:27:21,043
I'm almost embarrassed for them,
to be honest.

335
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:23,679
You know, stepping and fetching like that.

336
00:27:26,224 --> 00:27:27,486
Has it been 30 minutes yet?

337
00:27:29,227 --> 00:27:30,592
Just.

338
00:27:37,336 --> 00:27:39,429
I guess we got our verdict.

339
00:27:41,907 --> 00:27:43,772
I'm not mad, you know?

340
00:27:44,509 --> 00:27:45,806
At them.

341
00:27:46,878 --> 00:27:50,780
They keep making us do push-ups like this,
we'll be all swoll.

342
00:27:51,483 --> 00:27:52,848
All of us are.

343
00:27:52,918 --> 00:27:55,944
You know, get paid and get in shape.

344
00:27:56,922 --> 00:28:00,119
- You got a girl, 17?
- No.

345
00:28:00,292 --> 00:28:01,281
What about you?

346
00:28:04,262 --> 00:28:06,594
- I'm at the start of something.
- Yeah?

347
00:28:06,832 --> 00:28:08,231
Me too. Feels good, doesn't it?

348
00:28:09,101 --> 00:28:11,831
- Good and bad.
- Mine's a barista.

349
00:28:13,405 --> 00:28:15,464
Wouldn't think a guy like me
could pull a barista, would you?

350
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,303
What exactly do you write, anyway?

351
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:20,972
- Comics.
- Graphic novels.

352
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,804
Yeah, <i>Flying Man's</i> my next big launch.

353
00:28:23,882 --> 00:28:25,042
<i>- Flying Man?</i>
- Yep.

354
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:28,509
The man who flies.

355
00:28:29,454 --> 00:28:32,446
- What's he do besides fly?
- See that?

356
00:28:32,657 --> 00:28:35,820
What you just said,
"What else he do besides fly?"

357
00:28:35,894 --> 00:28:39,557
That's how jaded people have become.
We're talking about flying here.

358
00:28:39,631 --> 00:28:42,964
Like a human being, actually flying.

359
00:28:43,068 --> 00:28:46,731
And no cape, nothing.
Just flying, you know?

360
00:28:46,872 --> 00:28:49,033
Like you or me in this cell
just kind of taking off

361
00:28:49,107 --> 00:28:51,803
like nothing could limit us.
Like we could just go, go, go.

362
00:28:51,943 --> 00:28:54,343
Tell me, honestly,
who is not gonna want to read that?

363
00:28:54,579 --> 00:28:58,037
I shouldn't be talking about this anyway.
My agent would kill me if he knew I was.

364
00:28:58,116 --> 00:29:00,277
- You got an agent, huh?
- Yeah, couple.

365
00:29:00,352 --> 00:29:02,616
How you like that, 77?

366
00:29:02,687 --> 00:29:06,020
Looks like we got a heavy hitter
in the box with us.

367
00:29:07,592 --> 00:29:08,854
Yeah, we do.

368
00:29:09,461 --> 00:29:13,090
9:00, ladies! Lights out!

369
00:29:53,105 --> 00:29:55,733
- Really, come on.
- What?

370
00:29:56,475 --> 00:30:00,309
- What is it?
- Move along, fuck-butt.

371
00:30:02,614 --> 00:30:05,981
Yum, yum, come on, people. Move along!

372
00:30:46,825 --> 00:30:48,952
Hey, hey, hey. You gotta clean your plate.

373
00:30:50,595 --> 00:30:51,926
Come on, man. That's not gonna happen.

374
00:30:53,532 --> 00:30:55,762
What are you?
Spokesman for the union now?

375
00:30:55,901 --> 00:30:57,493
Look, nobody's trying to be difficult.

376
00:30:57,569 --> 00:31:01,005
We'll eat everything else, just not that.

377
00:31:01,206 --> 00:31:04,403
I mean, look at it.
It literally might be dog shit.

378
00:31:12,017 --> 00:31:14,747
It's beans. Come on, eat them.

379
00:31:16,154 --> 00:31:17,451
Come on, guys.

380
00:31:17,522 --> 00:31:19,820
It's not like I'm being
unreasonable here, right?

381
00:31:19,891 --> 00:31:22,485
I mean, we got rules, okay?

382
00:31:22,561 --> 00:31:25,860
Rule number one:
You gotta clean your plate.

383
00:31:25,931 --> 00:31:28,559
Rule number six says,
"You gotta eat dog shit."

384
00:31:28,633 --> 00:31:30,897
It's not dog shit.

385
00:31:32,537 --> 00:31:34,061
It's dog shit.

386
00:31:35,874 --> 00:31:39,708
Well, that's too bad.
'Cause you gotta eat it anyway.

387
00:31:39,778 --> 00:31:42,406
Okay, I'm gonna just...
Oh, my God. My dog shit!

388
00:31:43,548 --> 00:31:45,607
You fucking shit. Out of there.

389
00:31:45,684 --> 00:31:49,176
Look, okay, memo to Adolf,
uniform's not real. Okay, baby?

390
00:31:49,254 --> 00:31:51,586
Hey, <i>Moulin Rouge,</i> you gotta eat it.

391
00:31:52,057 --> 00:31:55,049
Nobody's leaving here
until their plates are clean.

392
00:31:55,927 --> 00:31:57,986
You heard the man, huh?

393
00:32:00,131 --> 00:32:01,962
The word is clean.

394
00:32:06,571 --> 00:32:09,233
- Clean? Is that the word?
- Yeah.

395
00:32:13,178 --> 00:32:14,406
Now it's clean.

396
00:32:19,618 --> 00:32:21,813
He just earned you guys
some more push-ups.

397
00:32:22,187 --> 00:32:25,816
Push-ups. You heard the man! Push-ups!

398
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:28,290
I'll give you push-ups. Push this up!

399
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:38,262
Complete wrong move, ass-licker.

400
00:32:40,505 --> 00:32:41,836
Step back!

401
00:32:48,813 --> 00:32:53,409
- You shouldn't have done that!
- Keep it up, girls. Get it out of your system.

402
00:32:53,685 --> 00:32:56,210
That's right, you goose-stepping pussy!

403
00:32:56,288 --> 00:32:59,018
I will see you girls tonight.

404
00:32:59,124 --> 00:33:02,025
Feel the wrath of Flying Man!

405
00:33:02,994 --> 00:33:04,120
Flying Man?

406
00:33:09,334 --> 00:33:10,323
Yeah.

407
00:33:10,702 --> 00:33:15,139
This is our house, bitches!
This is our house!

408
00:33:15,707 --> 00:33:19,473
Only reason,
only fucking reason they did that

409
00:33:19,544 --> 00:33:23,241
was 'cause they knew
they weren't gonna get their asses kicked.

410
00:33:23,315 --> 00:33:27,445
You take away someone's fear
of getting punched in the fucking mouth,

411
00:33:28,653 --> 00:33:30,644
all of a sudden,
they're the biggest cocksuckers

412
00:33:30,722 --> 00:33:32,587
on the fucking planet.

413
00:33:33,191 --> 00:33:36,490
That may be true, but the rules are the rules.

414
00:33:36,561 --> 00:33:37,926
We don't use violence.

415
00:33:43,401 --> 00:33:44,993
Well, we obviously gotta do something.

416
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:48,631
I mean, we are being tested
just as much as they are.

417
00:33:48,707 --> 00:33:51,835
They made me look like a fucking pussy
is what they did.

418
00:33:52,243 --> 00:33:53,335
Yeah.

419
00:33:53,945 --> 00:33:55,537
I got an idea.

420
00:33:57,282 --> 00:34:00,547
I pledged for a fraternity once.

421
00:34:00,819 --> 00:34:03,583
And during Hell Week, the brothers,

422
00:34:04,422 --> 00:34:06,151
they would break down our will.

423
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:09,920
They would try to humble us
for the initiation that was gonna come.

424
00:34:10,528 --> 00:34:14,191
I mean, the rules,
they were pretty much the same as here.

425
00:34:14,265 --> 00:34:16,927
I mean, they couldn't hurt us.

426
00:34:17,669 --> 00:34:20,194
But they could do something much worse,

427
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:23,630
they could humiliate us.

428
00:34:27,011 --> 00:34:29,138
That's what we have to do.

429
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:35,879
Is we have to humiliate them.

430
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:01,135
What? What are you doing?

431
00:35:10,221 --> 00:35:15,056
- What the hell is the matter with you?
- That is for inciting them.

432
00:35:15,126 --> 00:35:17,390
- What? What are you talking about?
- Shut up.

433
00:35:17,729 --> 00:35:21,563
You need to shut up. All right?

434
00:35:30,608 --> 00:35:34,601
There will be no more incidents

435
00:35:35,613 --> 00:35:37,410
like there was today.

436
00:35:38,516 --> 00:35:40,245
Is that understood?

437
00:35:42,454 --> 00:35:45,514
I said, is that understood?

438
00:35:46,024 --> 00:35:47,719
- Yes.
- Yes.

439
00:35:47,792 --> 00:35:50,818
Yes, what? 'Cause I can't hear you.

440
00:35:51,196 --> 00:35:53,426
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

441
00:36:01,372 --> 00:36:04,739
Who's the bitches now, bitches?

442
00:36:08,012 --> 00:36:11,209
Great job, guys. Great job.

443
00:36:11,883 --> 00:36:13,510
- Dude, I...
- Great job.

444
00:36:15,887 --> 00:36:19,755
- Nice speech.
- Good job, good job.

445
00:36:20,592 --> 00:36:22,560
I'll catch up later.

446
00:37:34,198 --> 00:37:37,463
Excuse me? Excuse me?

447
00:37:40,071 --> 00:37:44,599
I'm having heat flashes.
I think my blood sugar is low.

448
00:37:47,712 --> 00:37:50,772
Capote, just shut the fuck up, okay?

449
00:37:55,486 --> 00:37:58,944
- What are you talking about, man?
- I'm having low blood sugar.

450
00:37:59,991 --> 00:38:03,518
If I gotta say "Shut the fuck up"
one more time...

451
00:38:15,974 --> 00:38:17,464
You all right?

452
00:38:30,755 --> 00:38:34,122
Okay, everybody's had their fun.

453
00:38:39,931 --> 00:38:42,559
I'm gonna suggest

454
00:38:43,601 --> 00:38:46,069
that we act like gentlemen
for the rest of the way.

455
00:38:46,337 --> 00:38:48,100
That we play by the rules

456
00:38:50,341 --> 00:38:52,639
these last 11 days.

457
00:38:53,578 --> 00:38:56,877
And everybody can go home happily
with their money.

458
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:00,477
How's that sound?

459
00:39:11,295 --> 00:39:12,694
Where is 51?

460
00:39:16,634 --> 00:39:18,295
Where's 51?

461
00:39:22,907 --> 00:39:24,397
Let's go.

462
00:39:30,214 --> 00:39:31,943
I need sugar.

463
00:39:33,985 --> 00:39:37,216
Look, diabetic.
Says he's diabetic on his application.

464
00:39:37,288 --> 00:39:39,654
So he needs insulin, that's what it is.

465
00:39:39,724 --> 00:39:42,887
No, no, no. Look.
It says he regulates it through diet.

466
00:39:43,961 --> 00:39:46,452
Yeah, man, it's in his own words.

467
00:39:46,564 --> 00:39:48,964
He's the one that filled this out.

468
00:39:51,636 --> 00:39:54,434
This is not a big deal. It's not.

469
00:39:54,505 --> 00:39:56,735
I mean, my fucking grandma
has basically the same thing,

470
00:39:56,808 --> 00:39:58,833
and she just gets moody in between meals.

471
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:01,936
Trust me, this is not a big deal.

472
00:40:03,548 --> 00:40:05,743
Fifty-one, you need to get up.

473
00:40:05,817 --> 00:40:07,910
Let's go, come on. Get up.

474
00:40:07,985 --> 00:40:09,543
Hey, I wanna do this.

475
00:40:09,721 --> 00:40:13,054
I do. I just need a Twix bar.

476
00:40:13,124 --> 00:40:14,955
There's one in my bag if you can find it.

477
00:40:15,026 --> 00:40:17,790
Twix bar. Is that what you wanna eat?

478
00:40:20,331 --> 00:40:23,061
Get him up. Get him up. Come on. Come on!

479
00:40:23,701 --> 00:40:26,226
- Are you kidding me?
- You're all right.

480
00:40:28,406 --> 00:40:32,342
- Hey, why don't you let the man be?
- You know the rules, 77.

481
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:35,208
All prisoners must participate in rec.

482
00:40:35,279 --> 00:40:39,545
And you do not address me
unless I have spoken to you first.

483
00:40:40,284 --> 00:40:42,149
The man... Look at him.

484
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,153
The man can't do it.

485
00:40:51,295 --> 00:40:56,130
You do understand that
this is a prison experiment, right?

486
00:40:56,334 --> 00:40:57,824
Yes.

487
00:40:57,902 --> 00:41:02,703
And you do understand
the roles that we've been given?

488
00:41:03,174 --> 00:41:06,143
- Obviously.
- You are a prisoner.

489
00:41:08,479 --> 00:41:12,677
You don't give orders, we give orders.

490
00:41:14,152 --> 00:41:16,780
Have I made myself completely clear
to you now?

491
00:41:19,824 --> 00:41:24,158
Let the man lie down.

492
00:41:30,768 --> 00:41:33,931
Do I need to escalate matters right now?

493
00:41:35,373 --> 00:41:37,273
Is that what I should do?

494
00:41:39,177 --> 00:41:40,872
What is that supposed to mean?

495
00:41:41,345 --> 00:41:45,213
It means that you won't shut up.

496
00:41:47,251 --> 00:41:51,915
And I am trying to figure out
how I'm supposed to deal with that.

497
00:41:54,926 --> 00:41:58,828
- Why don't you try being rational?
- How is this for rational?

498
00:41:58,896 --> 00:42:00,261
Do I look rational now? Do I?

499
00:42:00,331 --> 00:42:01,958
- Let's put the sugar in him real quick, man.
- Put it away.

500
00:42:02,033 --> 00:42:03,057
Do I look rational now?

501
00:42:03,134 --> 00:42:07,127
You hit me and the experiment is over.

502
00:42:08,406 --> 00:42:10,897
You know that and I know that.

503
00:42:12,577 --> 00:42:14,738
Easy now, brother. Come on.

504
00:42:14,812 --> 00:42:16,575
Okay. It's okay.

505
00:42:16,647 --> 00:42:19,377
All right, everyone, back in their cell.

506
00:42:19,717 --> 00:42:21,981
Let's go, guards!
Get them back in their cells!

507
00:42:22,053 --> 00:42:23,850
- Let's go.
- Get in!

508
00:42:24,622 --> 00:42:25,611
I don't need an escort.

509
00:42:28,626 --> 00:42:30,890
This ain't right! I ain't playing that shit.

510
00:42:30,962 --> 00:42:32,259
Go. Move!

511
00:43:07,298 --> 00:43:09,596
<i>What do you think they want from us?</i>

512
00:43:11,435 --> 00:43:14,302
Why would you run a prison experiment?

513
00:43:17,041 --> 00:43:19,168
Throw some animals in a cage

514
00:43:19,844 --> 00:43:23,712
and you get to find out which one
of us is gonna be the lions

515
00:43:24,282 --> 00:43:26,773
and which ones are gonna get gut.

516
00:43:27,351 --> 00:43:33,347
I like to think we're slightly higher
on the evolutionary chain than monkeys.

517
00:43:33,658 --> 00:43:37,094
It don't matter how evolved you think we are.

518
00:43:37,161 --> 00:43:41,791
You lock up any animal long enough
and the strong's gonna eat the weak.

519
00:43:42,033 --> 00:43:43,762
That's just the way it is.

520
00:43:48,172 --> 00:43:50,003
You learn that in prison, 17?

521
00:43:53,978 --> 00:43:56,845
- You must think I'm somebody else, slick.
- No.

522
00:43:56,914 --> 00:44:00,145
Just that tattoo you got there is an Aryan tat,

523
00:44:00,217 --> 00:44:03,744
so I figured, you know,
you probably got that in the pen.

524
00:44:09,894 --> 00:44:12,192
Expert in the penitentiary system,
are you, boy?

525
00:44:12,797 --> 00:44:15,823
I just watch a lot of Discovery Channel.

526
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:20,166
You will not interfere
with my ability to make a paycheck.

527
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:24,664
You understand?

528
00:44:26,978 --> 00:44:30,379
We're cool. No sweat.

529
00:44:36,821 --> 00:44:39,551
So, what were you in for anyway?

530
00:44:44,261 --> 00:44:48,630
- Did you really just ask me that?
- Yeah. I just asked you that.

531
00:44:50,201 --> 00:44:53,466
- You better pump your brakes, boy.
- Oh, yeah?

532
00:44:54,438 --> 00:44:57,771
- Why's that?
- Lf you don't start respecting the guards,

533
00:44:58,342 --> 00:45:00,867
you're gonna have a serious problem.

534
00:45:03,147 --> 00:45:06,014
- They're not guards.
- No, they're guards all right.

535
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:09,911
And them up there,
they're getting exactly what they want.

536
00:45:13,824 --> 00:45:16,622
I suggest you stop protecting your friend.

537
00:45:17,628 --> 00:45:18,993
What's right is right, man.

538
00:45:19,063 --> 00:45:22,089
Last thing a man wants to be in the pen
is right.

539
00:45:22,266 --> 00:45:23,494
Dudes, they...

540
00:45:24,101 --> 00:45:27,468
They start digging in
and getting all righteous then.

541
00:45:28,539 --> 00:45:32,839
That only leads to one place.
Go along to get along, man.

542
00:45:33,377 --> 00:45:38,144
Whatever fire you got in your belly,
you're best to let it go.

543
00:45:39,717 --> 00:45:40,945
Trust me.

544
00:45:42,653 --> 00:45:44,018
Let it go.

545
00:45:44,655 --> 00:45:45,723
<i>All I know</i>

546
00:45:47,525 --> 00:45:51,962
is homie lost his shit back there.

547
00:45:52,997 --> 00:45:55,932
- It was just a show.
- For you, maybe.

548
00:45:57,168 --> 00:46:01,366
- Half those fuckers, they were ready to go.
- They weren't gonna do anything.

549
00:46:01,439 --> 00:46:03,066
How well do you know them?

550
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:05,205
The assholes outnumber us, for one.

551
00:46:05,276 --> 00:46:07,335
If they wanted to take the advantage,
they could.

552
00:46:07,411 --> 00:46:10,175
Us out here in the middle
of fucking nowhere, we're on our own.

553
00:46:10,948 --> 00:46:12,711
The experimenters,
they wouldn't let anything happen.

554
00:46:12,783 --> 00:46:14,808
How well do you know them?

555
00:46:19,356 --> 00:46:22,723
Seventy-seven, he's the ringleader.

556
00:46:23,928 --> 00:46:28,797
Either way, if it keeps going like this,
someone's gonna throw down.

557
00:46:29,166 --> 00:46:33,159
Look, guys, guys.
If anyone gets hurt, this experiment is over.

558
00:46:33,237 --> 00:46:34,329
None of us will get paid.

559
00:46:34,405 --> 00:46:36,896
Well, we gotta put the clamps on this thing
once and for all then.

560
00:46:37,808 --> 00:46:39,400
What're you thinking?

561
00:46:42,046 --> 00:46:43,877
You wanna know how to reach these guys?

562
00:46:45,182 --> 00:46:46,171
How?

563
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,844
You scare 'em.

564
00:47:34,665 --> 00:47:36,098
Comfortable?

565
00:47:42,973 --> 00:47:44,167
Helweg?

566
00:47:48,245 --> 00:47:49,473
Come on...

567
00:47:57,488 --> 00:48:01,219
The prisoners, they listen to you.

568
00:48:03,961 --> 00:48:07,920
For some reason they look to you
like you're the leader.

569
00:48:10,701 --> 00:48:12,430
I got news for you.

570
00:48:12,503 --> 00:48:14,130
In here,

571
00:48:14,205 --> 00:48:17,766
you're the leader of shit.

572
00:48:20,044 --> 00:48:22,911
This place, it belongs to us.

573
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:25,005
It belongs to us.

574
00:48:27,418 --> 00:48:31,081
Hey, there are all kinds of things
that we could do to you

575
00:48:32,756 --> 00:48:36,487
to make you hip to that fact.

576
00:48:47,805 --> 00:48:53,766
So, do we have the proper respect

577
00:48:54,044 --> 00:48:55,807
for authority now?

578
00:48:57,681 --> 00:49:00,377
Fuck you, you sick fuck.

579
00:49:34,151 --> 00:49:36,745
This stuff is going right through me.

580
00:49:41,892 --> 00:49:43,951
- Saddle up, gentlemen!
- Fuck!

581
00:49:44,028 --> 00:49:45,893
You want to send a message?

582
00:49:45,963 --> 00:49:49,091
Then send a message. Saddle up.

583
00:49:51,802 --> 00:49:53,531
Saddle up!

584
00:49:57,341 --> 00:49:58,330
What the hell...

585
00:50:38,716 --> 00:50:39,978
You okay?

586
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:33,434
That was colossally fucked up.

587
00:51:34,104 --> 00:51:36,368
I mean, you are shit-ass nuts,
you know that?

588
00:51:38,275 --> 00:51:40,641
And that's a good thing, Barris.

589
00:51:41,779 --> 00:51:47,911
The light, it didn't come on.
They saw it, and it's not coming on.

590
00:51:50,421 --> 00:51:55,723
We did what we did, we sent a message,
but it never leaves this place.

591
00:51:56,026 --> 00:51:57,516
I got something to say.

592
00:51:58,996 --> 00:52:03,330
If anything happens like that again,
anything at all,

593
00:52:05,569 --> 00:52:06,695
I'm out of here.

594
00:52:08,539 --> 00:52:11,872
You make a unilateral decision like that,

595
00:52:14,645 --> 00:52:17,944
it could cost the rest of us 100 grand.

596
00:52:21,452 --> 00:52:23,113
I don't care, sir.

597
00:52:40,537 --> 00:52:42,198
Let it go.

598
00:52:58,789 --> 00:52:59,813
Scenario.

599
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:04,224
Someone harms someone you love.
Rapes them, kills them.

600
00:53:04,294 --> 00:53:05,625
The law fails to prosecute.

601
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:10,326
This person is free.
There is absolutely nothing you can do.

602
00:53:10,634 --> 00:53:14,195
- Would you consider that justice?
- I don't think on those terms.

603
00:53:14,271 --> 00:53:18,605
Justice is what keeps us safe
as a society. Ordered.

604
00:53:18,675 --> 00:53:24,341
Well, justice is... Well, it starts wars.
An eye for an eye for an eye.

605
00:53:25,816 --> 00:53:29,650
It takes a turning of the cheek
for this species to evolve.

606
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:32,484
So, you're the one who knows
what it's going to take

607
00:53:32,556 --> 00:53:34,490
for the human species to evolve.

608
00:53:34,658 --> 00:53:37,491
Just regurgitating what people
a lot smarter than me have been saying

609
00:53:37,561 --> 00:53:40,291
for a long, long time.

610
00:54:15,432 --> 00:54:16,490
Hey.

611
00:54:20,871 --> 00:54:24,967
Look what I found. Take it.
That ought to boost your blood sugar.

612
00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:28,099
No, it won't.

613
00:54:28,211 --> 00:54:30,270
Yeah, there's a lot of carbohydrates in there.

614
00:54:30,347 --> 00:54:35,341
It's like the world's cheapest bread.
It's going to turn to sugar. Trust me.

615
00:54:35,919 --> 00:54:38,080
Yeah, it won't turn to insulin, though.

616
00:54:40,424 --> 00:54:42,358
I thought you didn't need insulin.

617
00:54:42,859 --> 00:54:43,917
Fibbed.

618
00:54:46,263 --> 00:54:53,101
If they wouldn't let me bring it down here,
I figured I could tough it out.

619
00:54:53,904 --> 00:54:55,269
Jesus Christ.

620
00:54:57,274 --> 00:54:59,071
- Benjy...
- Fifty-one.

621
00:54:59,142 --> 00:55:02,634
Listen, you can't play around with this.
I got to let them know immediately.

622
00:55:02,713 --> 00:55:04,237
I mean, they need to know.
I got to get you out of here.

623
00:55:04,314 --> 00:55:05,303
No.

624
00:55:06,083 --> 00:55:08,074
You don't understand. You could die.

625
00:55:08,585 --> 00:55:11,748
Not if I get the insulin.

626
00:55:15,559 --> 00:55:17,322
Why are you doing this?

627
00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:25,268
Flying Man is a fraud.

628
00:55:26,903 --> 00:55:27,892
Don't say that.

629
00:55:27,971 --> 00:55:34,274
Yeah. It's stupid. It's a stupid, shitty, fat lie.
Just like me.

630
00:55:35,012 --> 00:55:36,604
He's just a man that flies.

631
00:55:42,653 --> 00:55:47,147
I need this. I need to stop being a fraud.

632
00:55:49,092 --> 00:55:53,051
I need for once to have something
to show for myself.

633
00:55:55,666 --> 00:56:00,433
Please, 77. Please.

634
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,868
- What the fuck you doing?
- Jesus!

635
00:56:41,011 --> 00:56:42,000
Nothing.

636
00:56:42,179 --> 00:56:46,479
- Don't beat your shit off next to me.
- I'm not beating my shit. Fuck off.

637
00:57:24,154 --> 00:57:26,987
I'll give you a thousand of my own money.

638
00:57:28,925 --> 00:57:30,620
He should just go.

639
00:57:31,895 --> 00:57:37,299
Listen, man, there's insulin in his bag.
Can you get it?

640
00:57:41,772 --> 00:57:43,933
You know that's not allowed.

641
00:57:45,475 --> 00:57:47,875
I'll give you two. Two thousand.

642
00:57:53,617 --> 00:57:55,949
Two thousand, man. He needs it.

643
00:58:06,029 --> 00:58:07,929
I don't need the money.

644
00:58:40,163 --> 00:58:43,860
Twenty-two. Get up.

645
00:58:45,635 --> 00:58:47,330
Captain wants to see you.

646
00:59:12,329 --> 00:59:14,422
Lucky for us, there's no cameras in here.

647
00:59:16,733 --> 00:59:17,859
What?

648
00:59:17,934 --> 00:59:21,995
All right, so if we're going to do this,
you can't tell anybody.

649
00:59:23,907 --> 00:59:25,374
The fuck are you talking about?

650
00:59:27,277 --> 00:59:29,871
All I want is a blow job. That's it.

651
00:59:30,747 --> 00:59:32,271
No, no, no, no.

652
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:36,285
Come on. Just get down on your knees.

653
00:59:36,353 --> 00:59:37,547
Yeah. I'm going to go back to my cell...

654
00:59:38,889 --> 00:59:41,255
First, you get down on your knees, all right?
All right?

655
00:59:41,324 --> 00:59:42,621
I want to go back to my cell.

656
00:59:42,692 --> 00:59:45,354
You will soon enough.
But first you're going to suck my dick.

657
00:59:45,762 --> 00:59:47,024
Suck it yourself.

658
00:59:47,097 --> 00:59:50,760
Get down on your knees.
Get down on your fucking knees.

659
00:59:54,271 --> 00:59:55,295
What's going on in here?

660
00:59:55,405 --> 00:59:56,429
Nothing.

661
00:59:56,706 --> 00:59:58,674
What is that prisoner doing out of his cell?

662
00:59:58,909 --> 01:00:02,606
He had something to tell me
about number 77.

663
01:00:03,113 --> 01:00:05,581
He didn't want to say it in front of the others.

664
01:00:05,649 --> 01:00:07,344
- Seventy-seven?
- Yeah.

665
01:00:07,417 --> 01:00:09,282
- Is that true?
- Yeah, that's true.

666
01:00:09,486 --> 01:00:11,477
No, I'm asking him. Is that true?

667
01:00:11,655 --> 01:00:13,384
It's true. It's true.

668
01:00:13,456 --> 01:00:16,857
Barris. Thank God I found you.
You got to come quick.

669
01:00:25,835 --> 01:00:26,824
See?

670
01:00:33,476 --> 01:00:34,534
Why?

671
01:00:46,389 --> 01:00:47,686
What were you doing back there?

672
01:00:49,793 --> 01:00:50,782
Nothing.

673
01:00:51,828 --> 01:00:53,921
I need you to empty your pockets
for me then.

674
01:00:56,366 --> 01:01:00,234
Empty your pockets, Bosch.
Empty that pocket right there.

675
01:01:17,721 --> 01:01:23,489
You know that nothing from the outside
world enters into this cell block.

676
01:01:24,027 --> 01:01:26,359
- You know that, right?
- I mean, I was...

677
01:01:26,596 --> 01:01:28,587
Quiet. Shut up.

678
01:01:32,902 --> 01:01:36,065
They're trying to get you to undermine me.
I know you would never do that.

679
01:01:38,208 --> 01:01:39,971
Who asked you to do that?

680
01:01:41,111 --> 01:01:43,102
You tell me and all will be forgiven.

681
01:01:45,515 --> 01:01:46,982
Who told you?

682
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:25,285
We need to talk later about this.

683
01:02:30,126 --> 01:02:31,218
Later.

684
01:02:55,218 --> 01:02:56,776
As you can see,

685
01:02:59,055 --> 01:03:00,647
I'm a reasonable man.

686
01:03:01,257 --> 01:03:05,216
I'm not the monster that you
somehow conjured up in your head.

687
01:03:10,667 --> 01:03:12,828
I've been given a position,

688
01:03:14,537 --> 01:03:16,232
didn't ask for it.

689
01:03:18,575 --> 01:03:23,308
In some ways it would've been easier
if I was just a prisoner.

690
01:03:24,147 --> 01:03:27,116
- Like you.
- I doubt that very much.

691
01:03:27,584 --> 01:03:29,313
You broke the rules again, 77.

692
01:03:29,385 --> 01:03:31,012
The guy could've died
if he didn't get his insulin...

693
01:03:31,087 --> 01:03:32,554
"The guy could've died
if he didn't get his insulin."

694
01:03:32,622 --> 01:03:33,987
"Guy could've died
if he didn't get his insulin."

695
01:03:34,190 --> 01:03:35,214
Did you hear that?

696
01:03:35,291 --> 01:03:37,350
A guy could've died
if he didn't get his insulin!

697
01:03:38,995 --> 01:03:40,257
Really?

698
01:03:40,363 --> 01:03:43,264
When you speak, can you hear yourself?

699
01:03:48,404 --> 01:03:51,567
What do you think is on
the other side of those cameras?

700
01:03:54,277 --> 01:03:56,336
We are being watched

701
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:01,878
24 hours a day by people
who know what they are doing.

702
01:04:02,752 --> 01:04:07,621
Do you think that if there was even a chance,
just the littlest bit of a chance,

703
01:04:08,825 --> 01:04:11,123
that somebody'd die,
that they would let it happen?

704
01:04:12,262 --> 01:04:14,696
He's perfectly safe, your friend.

705
01:04:16,733 --> 01:04:21,568
They will keep him perfectly safe.

706
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:27,271
When this is over,
you know what you ought to do?

707
01:04:27,677 --> 01:04:28,769
No.

708
01:04:29,946 --> 01:04:32,176
You ought to take this money,

709
01:04:32,982 --> 01:04:36,474
take a little time off
from whatever it is that you do.

710
01:04:37,587 --> 01:04:41,421
Check into a nice, clean mental facility

711
01:04:41,824 --> 01:04:45,692
where experts can properly diagnose
what exactly is wrong with you.

712
01:04:46,196 --> 01:04:48,460
Maybe you could suggest to me
a mental facility,

713
01:04:48,531 --> 01:04:52,433
because obviously you're running around
in a mental facility inside of your head.

714
01:04:53,403 --> 01:04:54,597
You're letting this guy
fucking run the show?

715
01:04:54,671 --> 01:04:56,070
You're still not following the rules.

716
01:04:56,139 --> 01:04:57,800
- You need help.
- Still arguing about the rules.

717
01:04:58,775 --> 01:05:02,211
I'm not trying to instigate anything.
You need to get help, okay?

718
01:05:02,712 --> 01:05:05,044
You need some fucking help.

719
01:05:06,783 --> 01:05:08,614
You know what I need?

720
01:05:09,185 --> 01:05:13,781
I need you to clean that toilet.

721
01:05:15,391 --> 01:05:20,294
- That's what I need.
- Enough. Enough of this shit, man.

722
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:24,361
Toilet! It's not cleaning itself.

723
01:05:24,534 --> 01:05:27,560
Let's just stop this, all right, guys?
Let's stop.

724
01:05:27,637 --> 01:05:29,161
You're in charge.
Does that make you happy?

725
01:05:29,572 --> 01:05:34,009
Toilet! I need you to clean my toilet!

726
01:05:34,177 --> 01:05:36,668
- Fuck you!
- Fuck me?

727
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:39,512
Fuck. You.

728
01:05:40,049 --> 01:05:44,577
I don't normally like to use profanity,
but fuck you!

729
01:05:45,822 --> 01:05:46,811
Fuck...

730
01:05:56,866 --> 01:05:59,164
You are a prisoner, 77.

731
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:02,531
But your pride is getting in the way.

732
01:06:05,908 --> 01:06:10,743
I think I need you to say it for me.

733
01:06:11,247 --> 01:06:14,614
Say, "I am a prisoner."

734
01:06:15,285 --> 01:06:16,411
Fuck you.

735
01:06:23,393 --> 01:06:24,621
Say it.

736
01:06:25,795 --> 01:06:26,921
Fuck...

737
01:06:39,876 --> 01:06:40,865
Say it.

738
01:06:50,219 --> 01:06:51,311
Go to hell.

739
01:07:10,673 --> 01:07:12,300
Stop it, please.

740
01:07:15,144 --> 01:07:17,339
Then say it for me.

741
01:07:22,285 --> 01:07:23,274
I...

742
01:07:25,722 --> 01:07:27,849
I am...

743
01:07:28,291 --> 01:07:32,557
A prisoner. A prisoner.

744
01:07:32,995 --> 01:07:37,591
A prisoner. I am a prisoner.

745
01:07:38,501 --> 01:07:42,562
Yes. Yes. Yes, 77.

746
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:48,301
That is exactly what you are.

747
01:09:34,817 --> 01:09:38,719
Hey. Talk to you for a minute?

748
01:09:46,395 --> 01:09:47,623
Come on.

749
01:09:55,938 --> 01:09:57,235
Let's go.

750
01:10:09,452 --> 01:10:14,253
- How come we can't talk back in the room?
- Some of the guys just wouldn't wait.

751
01:10:19,028 --> 01:10:22,589
Whatever you guys are going to do,
please don't do it.

752
01:10:53,095 --> 01:10:59,125
I think it's pretty clear by now there will be
a zero tolerance for breaking the rules.

753
01:11:08,311 --> 01:11:13,271
Bosch will be joining the prison population.

754
01:11:14,016 --> 01:11:18,112
He will be referred to now as Prisoner 76.

755
01:11:19,622 --> 01:11:23,114
Is there a problem with that, Prisoner 77?

756
01:11:26,495 --> 01:11:27,587
Good.

757
01:11:30,633 --> 01:11:35,798
I am an equitable man. Equitable. Equitable.

758
01:11:36,939 --> 01:11:43,037
<i>Not once, not once can you accuse me</i>

759
01:11:43,145 --> 01:11:44,510
<i>of breaking the rules.</i>

760
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:48,107
<i>The rules, they help us</i>
<i>because they guide us...</i>

761
01:11:52,555 --> 01:11:55,683
<i>So that we can exist. So that we can exist.</i>

762
01:11:56,425 --> 01:11:58,017
Exist in this world.

763
01:12:00,062 --> 01:12:03,088
Everybody's not happy with their lot in life.

764
01:12:04,033 --> 01:12:06,467
They have a position, he has a position,

765
01:12:06,736 --> 01:12:10,672
and all of you, all of you,
you have your positions.

766
01:12:11,641 --> 01:12:17,204
And I, I have a position.
Without the rules, there's chaos.

767
01:12:23,219 --> 01:12:24,584
Put that back on.

768
01:12:35,965 --> 01:12:38,957
I said, put that back on, 77.

769
01:12:45,408 --> 01:12:46,807
Did you hear me, 77?

770
01:12:50,012 --> 01:12:54,881
Put it back on! You put that back on.
You get back in the line.

771
01:12:55,384 --> 01:12:59,343
Don't take another step. What're you doing?
Just let him go by? Stop him!

772
01:13:00,456 --> 01:13:03,653
Open the gate. You in there.

773
01:13:03,726 --> 01:13:04,750
- We're done.
- Seventy-seven.

774
01:13:04,927 --> 01:13:06,918
You hear me? We're done.

775
01:13:07,496 --> 01:13:08,895
We're done.

776
01:13:13,402 --> 01:13:17,429
Nobody speaks to them, do you hear me?
Nobody.

777
01:13:17,773 --> 01:13:21,641
Nobody can speak to them.
You don't say one single word to them!

778
01:13:21,711 --> 01:13:25,977
That's rule number one now.
Nobody speaks to them!

779
01:13:26,048 --> 01:13:27,675
That's my friend!

780
01:13:47,570 --> 01:13:49,936
You fucking lowlife! You piece of shit!

781
01:13:50,005 --> 01:13:52,132
You couldn't just shut the fuck up,
could you?

782
01:13:52,208 --> 01:13:54,335
You brought this on your fucking self!

783
01:13:54,844 --> 01:13:56,209
Fuck you!

784
01:13:57,279 --> 01:14:00,908
Divide the prisoners up.
Isolate them so they can't communicate.

785
01:14:00,983 --> 01:14:04,475
The only strength in numbers
I want inside this place is ours.

786
01:14:56,739 --> 01:15:02,905
How the fuck can you listen to that shit?
I can't even fucking think.

787
01:15:03,179 --> 01:15:04,373
All I know is I'm out of here.

788
01:15:06,081 --> 01:15:08,879
You do know that any decisions we make,

789
01:15:08,951 --> 01:15:10,009
we make together?

790
01:15:10,085 --> 01:15:11,279
Well, this thing's over.

791
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:12,977
We used violence
and the experiment's done.

792
01:15:13,055 --> 01:15:17,219
Is it? It's been a lot longer than half an hour
and red light hasn't come on yet.

793
01:15:17,293 --> 01:15:18,521
So fucking what?

794
01:15:18,594 --> 01:15:22,553
If you think about this rationally,
it was the prisoners who did the violence.

795
01:15:22,631 --> 01:15:24,724
We just responded commensurately.

796
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:28,497
Fuck commensurately.
And fuck that fucking red light!

797
01:15:29,371 --> 01:15:31,202
How can you say that?

798
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:34,438
The red light,
that's the only thing that we have!

799
01:15:34,543 --> 01:15:35,532
Don't you realize that?

800
01:15:39,014 --> 01:15:42,142
It's the only way that we can know.

801
01:15:46,288 --> 01:15:47,312
Where's my music?

802
01:16:00,202 --> 01:16:02,568
You can feel what's happening, right?

803
01:16:03,572 --> 01:16:06,564
You're fucking crazy. You know that?

804
01:16:08,310 --> 01:16:09,868
Can you feel it?

805
01:16:45,347 --> 01:16:51,343
What? Camera? Camera.

806
01:16:56,392 --> 01:16:59,589
Why? Why would you have...

807
01:16:59,662 --> 01:17:02,722
Why don't you stop this? Why?

808
01:17:28,157 --> 01:17:34,357
I'll fucking kill you. Kill. I'll fucking kill you.

809
01:17:55,818 --> 01:17:58,912
I'm going to take that tape off of you.

810
01:17:58,988 --> 01:18:01,980
And you're going to give me what I want.
Okay?

811
01:18:04,493 --> 01:18:05,517
Fuck you.

812
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:11,622
You're a fucking faggot. You know that.

813
01:18:15,404 --> 01:18:20,842
Aren't you afraid? Yeah. Yeah.

814
01:18:22,478 --> 01:18:23,911
I know you.

815
01:18:40,596 --> 01:18:45,898
You didn't think I would see?
You didn't think I was smart enough?

816
01:18:52,775 --> 01:18:54,470
Please don't hit me again.

817
01:18:54,743 --> 01:18:56,506
Hey, I was going to try to be nice.

818
01:19:06,455 --> 01:19:08,389
Fucking kill you.

819
01:19:19,468 --> 01:19:20,662
Please.

820
01:19:24,039 --> 01:19:27,702
You know, if your mouth
doesn't want to play nice,

821
01:19:30,212 --> 01:19:32,840
we'll just have to use the other end.

822
01:19:45,928 --> 01:19:48,829
No. No, no, please. Wait, wait. Time out.

823
01:19:48,897 --> 01:19:52,162
- Shut up!
- Time out, time out.

824
01:20:22,164 --> 01:20:24,758
No. Please don't do this.

825
01:20:27,035 --> 01:20:28,024
Hi.

826
01:20:39,648 --> 01:20:41,445
Go to sleep, motherfucker, go to sleep.

827
01:20:42,050 --> 01:20:44,541
You think fags are funny?
Who's funny now?

828
01:20:54,496 --> 01:21:00,298
- Hey, kid. You all right?
- No. Thank you. Thank you.

829
01:21:13,115 --> 01:21:14,707
You still want to go along and get along?

830
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:16,410
Fuck no.

831
01:21:22,724 --> 01:21:25,488
These boys must think I'm somebody else.

832
01:21:38,473 --> 01:21:39,963
Everybody's out, man.

833
01:21:43,412 --> 01:21:45,346
Hey, buddy. Hey, man.

834
01:22:06,868 --> 01:22:09,063
No, no, no. Come on.

835
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:27,681
Barris, we got trouble.

836
01:22:33,028 --> 01:22:34,052
Coming for you!

837
01:22:34,563 --> 01:22:35,552
Jesus.

838
01:23:02,291 --> 01:23:04,384
Jesus. What'll we do?

839
01:23:05,761 --> 01:23:06,921
We get ready.

840
01:23:09,598 --> 01:23:13,796
You're fucking losing it, man.
They outnumber us two to one.

841
01:23:21,276 --> 01:23:26,043
Maybe, but they're still prisoners.
And they're still scared of us.

842
01:23:28,684 --> 01:23:30,675
We're the authority here.

843
01:23:33,555 --> 01:23:36,217
Does that look like they give a fuck?

844
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:40,858
Fuck your authority.

845
01:23:42,698 --> 01:23:44,666
About fucking time.

846
01:24:29,411 --> 01:24:33,074
What're you doing? What are you doing?
We got to stand and fight!

847
01:24:33,181 --> 01:24:36,912
This is our world!
You cannot take it from us! No!

848
01:24:37,252 --> 01:24:38,378
Why are you doing this?

849
01:24:38,587 --> 01:24:40,817
We're still guards! Guards!

850
01:25:00,409 --> 01:25:02,309
This is your fault!

851
01:29:42,424 --> 01:29:46,656
You still think we're higher
on the evolutionary chain than monkeys?

852
01:29:55,103 --> 01:29:56,297
Yeah.
