1
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,715
So what's in the video?

2
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,154
Come on, Yukiko!

3
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,598
You saw it, didn't you?
You can tell me!

4
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,396
What? No way!
I'm not watching it!

5
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,228
A well?

6
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,159
No, nothing.

7
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,829
Last night I had a strange dream.

8
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,319
There was a well in it.

9
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,348
A really old one...

10
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,076
The edge had crumbled away.

11
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,754
I looked inside, but...

12
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,673
..it was pitch black,
I couldn't see anything.

13
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,076
The house looked empty.

14
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,032
I went inside.

15
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,709
The place was a ruin.

16
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,996
There was a flight of stairs.

17
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,389
But something told me
I absolutely shouldn't go up.

18
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,473
I just stood there. I couldn't move.

19
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,239
30 Years Before

20
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,077
Ms Sudo...

21
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,353
There's a reporter to see you...
in there.

22
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,155
Thank you.

23
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,710
I'm Miyaji, from 'Chuo Nippo'.

24
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,950
You taught a Yamamura Sadako
1 1 years ago...

25
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,831
I'm afraid there's no picture of her.

26
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,508
Would you like to look?

27
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,434
She came into the school
after the year had started.

28
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,235
Then her mother died
and her father came for her.

29
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,749
They left the island.

30
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,829
- Dr lkuma Heihachiro?
- Yes.

31
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,477
Sadako was only here
until the middle of the second term.

32
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,432
What was she like?

33
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,515
A very intelligent girl.
Very pretty.

34
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,078
I went to see her relatives.

35
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,476
They wouldn't talk to me.

36
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:23,275
There was all that trouble
over her mother, Shizuko...

37
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,040
Her suicide and all...

38
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,792
Did Sadako have powers...

39
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,718
..Iike her mother did?

40
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,516
That I wouldn't know.

41
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,437
Only...

42
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,957
Sadako was...

43
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,879
..terribly afraid of the sea.

44
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,318
The sea?

45
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,711
All those children
in the picture drowned.

46
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,911
14 of them.

47
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,472
One swimming class,

48
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,269
they went to the beach.

49
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,870
Sadako was simply terrified.

50
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,032
"lf you go in the sea,
you'll all die!" she said.

51
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,508
No luck! No one knows
where Dr lkuma went!

52
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,312
Miyaji!

53
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,916
Sadako was the only one
who didn't swim.

54
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,956
She just sat all hunched up
on the beach, staring at the sea.

55
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,994
Then, from out in the bay,

56
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,273
the kids all staed screaming...

57
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:37,910
RING O 'BIRTHDAY'

58
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,039
"lf I could be reborn...

59
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,949
..even though it violate
the will of God himself...

60
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,709
..I would want to be at your side...

61
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,875
..with you."

62
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,791
If it were all a dream...

63
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,193
..when I awoke...

64
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,951
If only you were there...

65
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,312
But...

66
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,750
the morning light
shows me as I really am.

67
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,910
Stop!

68
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,518
Enough.

69
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,074
Take a break.

70
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,635
We'll break for lunch.

71
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,992
Everyone back in an hour.

72
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,958
Aiko's not herself lately.

73
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,675
Maybe if Mr Shigemori
wasn't so irritable...

74
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,078
- Where should we have lunch?
- I don't care.

75
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,919
You're no fun!

76
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,790
What?

77
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,592
What are you staring at?

78
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,957
Creep!

79
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,354
You know, before that girl came,

80
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,393
Aiko and Shigemori got along fine.

81
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,829
What do you mean?

82
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,510
Nothing...just the feeling I get.

83
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,878
Sadako, huh?

84
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,758
She works really hard
and she's so pretty...

85
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,873
..but she is a little strange.

86
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,309
So... are you getting used
to life in Tokyo?

87
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,312
Yes.

88
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,956
Last time I gave you
a fairly strong tranquilliser.

89
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,153
Are you still seeing strange things?

90
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,591
No.

91
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,396
I'm sure it's just nerves.

92
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,479
It's a psychogenic disorder.

93
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,070
I feel more relaxed
now I've joined the drama troupe.

94
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,952
You do?

95
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,199
Certainly performing
has therapeutic value.

96
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,754
Do you like the troupe?

97
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,111
Yes.

98
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,515
Amazing!

99
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,951
So drama is the best medicine...

100
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,152
Sadako...

101
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,591
Don't be too enthusiastic.
People won't like it.

102
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,078
OK.

103
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,357
Come in!

104
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,959
Excuse me!

105
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,993
- Your costume is done.
- Hang it up!

106
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,275
Aiko, you're looking
a little pale. Are you all right?

107
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,630
- Since that girl came...
- Who?

108
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,753
Oh, Sadako...

109
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,668
I keep seeing something behind her.

110
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,998
Here we go again!

111
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,752
And a well, too.

112
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,395
A well?

113
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:41,319
I keep having these bad dreams.

114
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,832
I go into a house by the well

115
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,316
and there are stairs leading up...

116
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,799
..but I'm too terrified to go up
them.

117
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,395
What?

118
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,474
I've had the same dream.

119
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,599
She was found in the river
this morning.

120
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,839
She fits the description
of the missing girl...

121
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,398
A scar on her face?

122
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,555
Doctor!

123
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,235
Is it her?

124
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,199
- Anna!
- Don't look!

125
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,638
She would hate you...

126
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,070
..to see that ugly scar.

127
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,798
I don't care how she looks!

128
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,513
If only I'd gone to see her...

129
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,751
..in the hospital!

130
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,155
Don't blame yourself.

131
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,993
There's no mistake.
That is my daughter.

132
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,313
I'm sorty.

133
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,678
It may all be for the best.

134
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,316
She might just as well
have been dead,

135
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,670
before this unfortunate accident.

136
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,155
Doctor!

137
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,035
Doctor!

138
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,759
Have you seen my daughter?

139
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,236
She left your hospital four days ago!

140
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,469
Once a patient sets foot
outside my hospital...

141
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,632
..she is my patient no longer.

142
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,031
Where your daughter may be
...I have no idea.

143
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,471
But that corpse in the river!

144
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,834
- Was it her?
- Unfortunately...

145
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,798
..it's my daughter who's dead.

146
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,996
What?

147
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,830
I am the one in need of sympathy.

148
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,838
I must prepare for her funeral.
If you would excuse me...

149
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:30,556
I would like to spend today
alone with my daughter.

150
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,310
Right! OK.

151
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,115
On to scene 2.
We'll take a short break.

152
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,153
Aiko?

153
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,471
Aiko?

154
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,918
I understand you studied
under Dr lkuma Heihachiro.

155
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,309
That's correct.

156
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,956
But his ESP research
was too much, even for me.

157
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,276
In the end he retracted
his own theories.

158
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:52,231
- And you agree with that?
- Of course.

159
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,269
I'd like you to listen to something.

160
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:04,474
There was the experiment
that drove him out of the profession.

161
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,079
Do you remember?

162
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,633
Yes.

163
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,195
And that a man died?

164
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,674
There was no connection.

165
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,192
This is a tape of that day.

166
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,155
Correct!

167
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,797
Correct!

168
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,312
Fraud!

169
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,195
It's nothing but a vulgar magic show!

170
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,188
I won't be fooled!
Dr Ikuma! You're being deceived!

171
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,799
Yes, that's right!

172
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,196
What's wrong?

173
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,670
She's a freak!

174
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,828
That noise appeared
only on this tape.

175
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,151
Can you explain that?

176
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,196
No.

177
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,109
More than one man has died.

178
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,830
In the last 1 2 years...

179
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,315
..everyone who was there has died.

180
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,796
The reporters
at that demonstration...

181
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,911
not one is alive today.

182
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,832
Do you have any idea
where Dr lkuma might be?

183
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,871
No.

184
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,878
Or his daughter Sadako?

185
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,638
I don't know.

186
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,839
So we don't even know yet
when the funeral will be.

187
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,474
Do we open or not?!

188
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,152
Wait! Wait a minute! Listen!

189
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,394
Losing Aiko is a heavy blow.

190
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,957
But we must carty on with the play.

191
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,878
She would have wanted that.

192
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,715
Now, I want you all to listen
carefully.

193
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,117
I've decided on an actress
who will take the part.

194
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,880
Yamamura Sadako, our student.

195
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,878
That's all.

196
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,512
Mr Shigemori!

197
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,995
Why Sadako?

198
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,279
Ignore them.

199
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,955
OK!

200
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,152
Places!

201
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,672
Hello?

202
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,872
Hello?

203
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,909
Who is this?

204
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,078
Why do you never speak?

205
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:08,232
- Andrei...
- Anna? Is that you?

206
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,552
Anna!

207
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,350
Do you know what will happen?!

208
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,469
Was that Andrei?

209
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,238
You died in that accident.

210
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,558
And soon you will be reborn!

211
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,196
Reborn?

212
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,675
Yes!

213
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,675
If...

214
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,280
..I could be reborn...

215
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:02,030
..even though it violate
the will of God himself...

216
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,670
..I would want to be at your side...

217
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,359
..with you.

218
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,393
If it were all a dream...

219
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,395
..when I awoke...

220
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,273
If only you were there...

221
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,674
But...

222
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,031
But the morning light
shows me...

223
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,077
..as I really am.

224
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,999
Still I want to say it...

225
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,394
I love you.

226
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,716
Goodnight.

227
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,068
Goodnight.

228
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,634
Sadako!

229
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,754
It'll be great.

230
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,272
Thanks.

231
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,076
Mr Toyama...

232
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,113
Don't look!

233
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,472
No!

234
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,276
It wasn't me!

235
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,992
Sadako!

236
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,470
- What did you see?
- Toyama...

237
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,400
- Yes?
- We don't have much time.

238
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,238
- Are you all ready?
- No.

239
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,275
So you're going to be working
all night...

240
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,992
About your cue here...

241
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,428
When the light comes on,

242
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,194
wait two beats.

243
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,234
Raise the tempo,
but don't lose the tension.

244
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,393
Here.

245
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,669
- Listen to this.
- What?

246
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,077
- Hear that?
- What is it?

247
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,390
This tape was running when Aiko died.

248
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,751
That noise wasn't there before.

249
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,793
So it was added later?

250
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,233
Was that someone saying
"I'm being killed"?

251
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,750
Rain, huh?

252
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,392
Your mother?

253
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,354
She's dead?

254
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,594
Go away.

255
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,758
I'll make you a star.

256
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,834
I can do that, you know.

257
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:13,757
- It's late. Why not stay the night?
- Yes, that would be best.

258
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:18,238
I can't. Tonight I'm meeting
a friend...

259
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,639
- Still here?
- Waiting for Toyama?

260
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,037
I've got to alter Sadako's dress.

261
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,550
Let her do that.
She's just a student!

262
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,752
That's not an actor's job.

263
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,798
By the way, Sadako and
Toyama have been acting funny.

264
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,195
I'd watch out.

265
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,553
- See you.
- Goodnight.

266
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:39,436
- Did you see Sadako here?
- No.

267
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,869
Something's strange...

268
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,396
Sadako?

269
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,949
So, you took the dress!
What for?

270
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,109
Me?

271
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,234
- Don't play the innocent!
- Hey!

272
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,035
It's like Kaoru said!
Since she came...

273
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,317
Stop it!

274
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,076
I'm sorty.

275
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:09,793
Sometimes I do things,

276
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,150
and I don't remember them.

277
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:18,832
Last night Mr Shigemori came
to my apartment...

278
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,800
..and I don't remember.

279
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,716
Sadako, won't you tell me
what it is that scares you?

280
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:45,117
There's someone here with me.

281
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,391
Even now?

282
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,079
It's not someone...

283
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,031
..that I don't know.

284
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,077
It's like a long, long time ago...

285
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:10,875
But I only remember fragments...

286
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:14,152
..from when I was a child...

287
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:20,355
..and there's something there
that terrifies me.

288
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:31,589
Mother...Mother...

289
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,598
Who is my father?

290
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,795
You were dreaming.

291
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,917
You fainted. Do you remember?

292
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,552
There's only coffee.

293
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,195
Sadako...

294
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,876
..there's no one here, is there?

295
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,635
What?

296
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,392
Sadako!

297
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,999
CV - Sadako Yamamura

298
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,838
Dr Kuno, please.

299
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,558
Dr Kuno, someone to see you.

300
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,119
I'm Tachihara Etsuko.
I'm in Yamamura Sadako's troupe.

301
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,431
She gave your name for a reference.

302
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,558
I'm sorty, I'm very busy.

303
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,078
Doctor!

304
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,353
Someone in our troupe is dead.
Right out of the blue.

305
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,072
Strange things have been happening
since she came.

306
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,593
Is there something unusual
about Sadako?

307
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,839
I'm afraid
I'm not in a position to say.

308
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,393
The Mask by Isamu Shigemori
Starring Sadako Yamamura

309
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,752
Toyama...

310
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:21,473
..keep away from Sadako. Please!

311
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:28,079
I met a doctor who knows her.

312
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,553
She's hiding something!

313
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,871
Not from me.

314
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,275
Oh?

315
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,628
Mr Shigemori's gone all strange.

316
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,956
You've noticed it, haven't you?

317
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,516
Everyone says
it's because of Sadako.

318
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,833
And it's not just him!

319
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,598
They say Aiko's death...

320
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,831
was her fault, too!

321
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,359
Everyone says so.

322
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,036
She's not normal!

323
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,955
Places, everyone.

324
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,875
Get out, will you?

325
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,319
That's Mr Shigemori.

326
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:50,271
- Please...
- Thank you.

327
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:03,392
I'm from 'Chuo Nippo'.
My name is Miyaji.

328
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,670
I realise you open tomorrow.

329
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,429
Thank you for giving us your time.

330
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,471
Not at all.

331
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:17,269
I understand you've chosen
a new actress...

332
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,159
..for the lead role.

333
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,156
Yes.

334
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,395
That's her.

335
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,919
"lf I could be reborn even though it
violate the will of God himself..."

336
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,713
May I talk to her?

337
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,355
Certainly.

338
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,238
Sadako!

339
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,272
Miss Sadako Yamamura?

340
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,278
May we have a word?

341
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,192
Miyaji...

342
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,311
That's her.

343
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:07,237
Find out where we can reach her.

344
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:21,150
Miyaji! There's someone here
from Oshima lsland. Over there.

345
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:28,198
What brings you all this way?

346
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,992
There was something
I just couldn't bring myself to say

347
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,634
when we last met.

348
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,037
I've never told this to anyone.

349
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,195
It's about the Yamamuras.

350
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:47,114
I called on them once

351
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:51,279
after Sadako started at our school.

352
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,038
By then, her mother,

353
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,316
Shizuko, had gone strange...

354
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:33,911
Suddenly there was
no-one else around.

355
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,516
I heard...

356
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,871
..a crawling sound
coming from upstairs...

357
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,554
After that...

358
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:11,558
I was always
afraid of the child, too.

359
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,832
I'd think crazy things...

360
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,069
..Iike which of the Sadakos...

361
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,593
..was at school today...

362
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,157
Well?

363
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,111
See for yourself.

364
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,999
The whole troupe is cursed.

365
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,749
And the photo of me?

366
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,155
There are other people
in the picture.

367
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,951
Those who died at the
demonstration...

368
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,750
Your fiancee.

369
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:38,480
Dr lkuma claimed that intentions
could become living things...

370
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:43,957
..that human thought
could change to energy.

371
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,589
But is that all it is?

372
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,599
Maybe it's another force
that summons Sadako.

373
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,515
Another one...

374
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:15,109
Anyway, this is one article
you won't be able to write.

375
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:19,279
This was never for an article.

376
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,154
Thanks for everything.

377
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,318
Don't you like
having your picture taken?

378
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,389
I've finally remembered...

379
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,589
who your mother was.

380
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,593
I remember the stoty.

381
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,631
She killed a man,

382
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,678
during a kind of experiment.

383
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,389
She didn't!

384
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:36,391
Aiko's death was no accident.

385
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:42,309
You'll do anything to be a star,
won't you.

386
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,836
Wait a minute!

387
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:54,195
Was it you who killed that reporter?

388
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,119
Just the woman I've been looking for!

389
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,072
You're perfect for an actress!

390
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,551
Sadako, do you intend to kill me?

391
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,275
You like Toyama that much?

392
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,711
If I die, I'll take you with me.

393
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,754
I'll tell everyone about you.

394
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,634
They won't let you live.

395
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,635
You're mine.

396
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:58,275
Is that you?

397
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,353
No!

398
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,189
It's not me!

399
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:09,349
No!

400
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:17,635
Mr Shigemori!

401
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,992
You bastard!

402
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,992
Toyama!

403
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:34,914
- You won't kill me!
- Mr Shigemori!

404
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,834
Toyama, don't!

405
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,074
Please! Keep away from me!

406
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,591
You're hurt!

407
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,839
Hold on, Toyama!

408
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,196
Let me see it!

409
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,273
The wound's closed up!

410
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,352
A deep cut like that!

411
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:33,678
The things left behind

412
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,278
Is that Etsuko?

413
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:10,677
This is Miyaji,
the reporter from earlier today.

414
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,189
I need your help.

415
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,711
They'll find Mr Shigemori
in the morning...

416
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,830
I'll confess.

417
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,035
No!

418
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,836
I won't let them torment you.

419
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:32,195
Stop it!

420
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,830
It's the only way.

421
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,035
Your hand's hot.

422
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,591
It has been for a while.

423
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:54,715
Here we go.

424
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,916
It's time for TV.

425
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,471
Aren't you cold?

426
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:04,832
I'll get you a glass of water.
You wait here.

427
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:27,473
We're not finished yet.

428
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:40,911
Go backstage.

429
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:48,519
Sadako! Go to the dressing room!

430
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,948
Quick!

431
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,796
- Where's Shigemori?
- He's not at home either.

432
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:13,911
- What do we do?
- We can't cancel. We'll go on.

433
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:43,596
Toyama...

434
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:56,678
When this is over,
let's go away somewhere.

435
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:58,515
Don't worty.

436
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:00,595
You'll be great.

437
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,355
You're beautiful.

438
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:16,072
We're about to open the doors!
Please get ready!

439
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,070
It's all right.

440
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:30,349
The girl touched him,
and suddenly he stood up!

441
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:32,915
- Watch him.
- Doctor!

442
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:42,351
- How much?
- 800 yen.

443
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:45,753
Your change.

444
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:54,557
Doctor!

445
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,355
Is it her?

446
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,675
- Anna!
- Don't look!

447
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:09,555
She would hate you...

448
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:14,238
to see that ugly scar.

449
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:18,751
I don't care how she looks!

450
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:24,713
If only I'd gone to see her
in the hospital!

451
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,910
Don't blame yourself.

452
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:34,716
There's no mistake.

453
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,796
That is my daughter.

454
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,671
I'm sorty.

455
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:48,832
It may all be for the best.

456
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,031
She might just as well have been dead

457
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,514
before this unfortunate accident.

458
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:55,875
Doctor!

459
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,831
Could you come here a minute?

460
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:14,874
Mr Shigemori's dead!

461
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:21,949
Sadako! She did this!

462
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,797
Don't let her get away!

463
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:52,031
Toyama... Yuki wants you.

464
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,709
There's a problem.

465
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:05,152
I know the cues. I'll take over.

466
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:09,032
OK.

467
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:22,637
Correct!

468
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:30,957
Correct!

469
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,037
Correct!

470
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:49,317
Correct!

471
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:57,549
Correct!

472
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:26,071
Toyama! What are you doing?!
Hey, Toyama!

473
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,832
Correct!

474
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,950
- What's wrong?
- I don't know!

475
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:40,397
Correct!

476
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:48,191
Etsuko, what did you do?

477
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:50,355
Don't you want to know

478
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:53,160
Everything about Sadako?

479
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:58,829
Who's that in the kimono?

480
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:01,358
Fraud!

481
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:02,959
It's nothing but...

482
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,519
a vulgar magic show!

483
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:07,914
- You can't fool me!
- Dr Ikuma!

484
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:10,236
You're being deceived!

485
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:17,915
Mother!

486
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,629
What's wrong?

487
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:46,356
She's a freak!

488
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:53,877
That sound...

489
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:58,037
It's the same as when Aiko died!

490
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:28,113
Sadako... Stop.

491
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:30,072
You have to stop.

492
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:35,554
You have a wonderful gift!

493
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:39,835
Settle down...

494
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:41,195
You must be calm.

495
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:44,595
Sadako!

496
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:46,958
Calm down!

497
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:49,275
Sadako!

498
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:39,951
Another one...

499
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:45,752
- Stop her!
- Don't let that monster get away!

500
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:48,671
Don't let her go!

501
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:51,915
Stop!

502
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:55,028
- Toyama!
- Sadako!

503
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:04,751
No!

504
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,991
- No!
- Sadako!

505
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:10,796
We won't do anything.

506
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:15,958
- We won't hurt you.
- Please! Stop it!

507
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:33,910
No! It's not me!

508
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:45,115
Sadako!

509
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:52,554
Stop it! Stop!

510
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:54,916
Sadako!

511
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:05,635
Sadako!

512
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:46,273
I was here to kill her!

513
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:53,155
But it's not over.

514
01:09:57,200 --> 01:10:01,512
You've all had the dream
about the well, haven't you?

515
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:05,354
There's another Sadako.

516
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:10,475
If we don't kill her,
we'll all die under the curse.

517
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,797
Ikuma Heihachiro

518
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:02,554
Dr lkuma raised Sadako.

519
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:06,833
He must be hiding her alter ego
somewhere else.

520
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:11,310
But where?

521
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:15,789
Probably not far from him.

522
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:54,036
Kaoru, watch Etsuko and Toyama.

523
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:15,556
Are you here to kill Sadako?

524
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:46,959
There was only one at first.

525
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:53,953
But at some point she split...

526
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:55,553
..into two.

527
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:01,310
One took after her mother.

528
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:06,196
The other one was probably
like her real father.

529
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:16,632
It drove her mother mad.

530
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:22,832
All I could do was use drugs
to stop the other one from growing.

531
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:57,635
Sadako!

532
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:24,630
Don't tell me
you brought Sadako here!

533
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:44,710
Please! Let them go!

534
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:47,070
Sadako's getting away!

535
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,511
She got away!

536
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:05,080
We have to get out of here!

537
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:11,477
Let me go!
Over there! That way!

538
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:14,956
No! Please! Stop!

539
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:23,197
Come on!

540
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:28,637
Are the people chasing us?

541
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:36,354
You go, Toyama.

542
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:39,599
No. We'll go together!

543
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:46,989
Quickly! Get away from me.

544
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:49,593
What are you saying?

545
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:53,955
Over here! This way!

546
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,911
I...

547
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:07,756
..want you to...

548
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:15,114
Get away!

549
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:17,948
Run!

550
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:20,276
Sadako! Not that way!

551
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:38,228
What are you going to do?

552
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:44,475
Stay back!

553
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:51,149
I can't...

554
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:54,714
