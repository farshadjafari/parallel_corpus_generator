1
00:00:24,823 --> 00:00:28,500
Though decadent and corrupt,
weakened by politics and war,

2
00:00:28,546 --> 00:00:32,816
the Roman Empire remained
the greatest power on earth.

3
00:00:32,859 --> 00:00:36,368
Then a new people, the Huns,
fierce and independent,

4
00:00:36,406 --> 00:00:38,279
appeared from the east.

5
00:00:38,321 --> 00:00:42,424
An ancient prophecy told of a man
who would one day unite the tribes

6
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,864
and challenge Rome
for the right to rule the world.

7
00:01:47,306 --> 00:01:49,594
- My arrow fell short!
- Aim higher.

8
00:01:49,637 --> 00:01:51,297
The deer outruns it.

9
00:01:51,342 --> 00:01:54,602
Perhaps it's time
you had a stronger bow.

10
00:01:56,317 --> 00:01:57,940
We're on Dunnotis' land.

11
00:01:57,985 --> 00:02:00,725
The chase was long.
We meant no harm.

12
00:02:00,769 --> 00:02:03,509
We'll send him
the antlers as a gift.

13
00:02:03,553 --> 00:02:05,769
Still, we might have been seen.

14
00:02:05,813 --> 00:02:08,445
If Dunnotis complains, we kill him.

15
00:02:08,492 --> 00:02:11,647
Hush, boy. It's foolish for Huns
to kill Huns.

16
00:02:11,693 --> 00:02:16,247
How can we conquer the western lands
if we fight among our own?

17
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:34,545
Father spoke of the western lands
during the hunt.

18
00:02:34,584 --> 00:02:37,359
He was there once,
when he was young.

19
00:02:37,401 --> 00:02:39,309
Did he discover them?

20
00:02:39,348 --> 00:02:42,194
No, no... Others discovered them
long ago.

21
00:02:42,237 --> 00:02:44,146
How?

22
00:02:45,646 --> 00:02:47,519
A gadfly.

23
00:02:49,786 --> 00:02:52,560
A warrior was taming a stallion,

24
00:02:52,604 --> 00:02:56,044
and a gadfly bit the stallion
so hard, it ran away.

25
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:59,972
The warrior followed
the stallion into the great marsh.

26
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:02,301
But there's no way past the marsh.

27
00:03:02,344 --> 00:03:06,650
Oh, the horse found a way,
and the warrior followed the horse,

28
00:03:06,692 --> 00:03:10,855
- and on the other side...
- He found the western lands.

29
00:03:10,903 --> 00:03:13,405
Father says we'll conquer them.

30
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:17,404
- When the Great King comes.
- How will we know when he comes?

31
00:03:17,443 --> 00:03:20,740
The Great King
will kneel to no man,

32
00:03:20,782 --> 00:03:23,284
and all men will kneel to him.

33
00:03:23,322 --> 00:03:26,346
He will rule the Hun as one nation,

34
00:03:26,383 --> 00:03:30,273
and hold the sword of the war god
in his hand.

35
00:03:30,314 --> 00:03:34,726
And... he'll go to bed
when he's told.

36
00:03:34,803 --> 00:03:36,463
Yes, Father.

37
00:04:34,395 --> 00:04:36,576
No! Attila, stop!

38
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:41,138
- I want to help! Let me help!
- Get under this cart.

39
00:04:41,177 --> 00:04:43,846
You stay in there.
Get out of the way.

40
00:05:26,507 --> 00:05:27,894
Father!

41
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:32,310
Father.

42
00:05:38,788 --> 00:05:40,282
Father...

43
00:05:52,112 --> 00:05:54,164
Get him!

44
00:06:05,923 --> 00:06:07,999
You are Mundzuk's son.

45
00:06:08,045 --> 00:06:09,811
Where is my grandmother?

46
00:06:09,853 --> 00:06:13,363
She is dead. Your father is dead.

47
00:06:13,402 --> 00:06:16,592
That's his reward
for hunting on our lands.

48
00:06:16,637 --> 00:06:19,662
I am your master now.

49
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,608
Kneel.

50
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,527
Kneel!

51
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:36,876
And I might let you live as my slave.

52
00:06:58,314 --> 00:06:59,843
Hyah! Hyah!

53
00:08:32,903 --> 00:08:34,705
What's your name, boy?

54
00:08:36,209 --> 00:08:39,541
Attila, son of Mundzuk.

55
00:08:39,582 --> 00:08:42,013
Don't you recognize me?

56
00:08:43,619 --> 00:08:46,500
I am Rua, your father's brother,

57
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:50,465
and it's a long time
since you've seen me.

58
00:08:50,506 --> 00:08:54,917
- My father's dead.
- Yes. Weeks ago.

59
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,284
You've been alone all this time?

60
00:08:59,308 --> 00:09:01,525
You're safe now. Come.

61
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:05,980
Unless you prefer
living alone on the steppes.

62
00:09:42,758 --> 00:09:46,018
What are the three sacred animals?

63
00:09:46,063 --> 00:09:48,565
The wolverine,
because he never retreats,

64
00:09:48,603 --> 00:09:51,234
the sheba,
because she protects her young,

65
00:09:51,281 --> 00:09:53,913
and the horse,
because it is sacred to the war god.

66
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:58,859
- How many layers in a bow?
- Two of wood, two of bone.

67
00:10:00,814 --> 00:10:05,404
How long must you heat
the bow before you string it?

68
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,491
Until the outer layer sweats.

69
00:10:07,527 --> 00:10:09,709
You've been taught well.

70
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,908
Go to your tent.

71
00:10:18,591 --> 00:10:21,022
He doesn't belong here.

72
00:10:21,061 --> 00:10:24,701
I took my brother's wife
and elder son.

73
00:10:24,748 --> 00:10:28,531
Should I leave the younger
to die on the steppe?

74
00:10:28,574 --> 00:10:29,961
Yes.

75
00:10:30,035 --> 00:10:32,111
Yes, for Bleda's sake.

76
00:10:32,158 --> 00:10:34,696
He's the elder.

77
00:10:34,732 --> 00:10:38,799
He'll get the larger portion
when I die.

78
00:10:38,837 --> 00:10:43,487
There will be trouble between them.
I can see it already.

79
00:10:55,918 --> 00:10:58,029
Who's there?

80
00:11:05,972 --> 00:11:07,987
Who are you?

81
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:12,365
- Who are you?
- Attila.

82
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:16,191
- I am Galen.
- What are you?

83
00:11:16,234 --> 00:11:19,744
- A girl. Are you blind?
- You look like an old woman.

84
00:11:19,784 --> 00:11:23,223
- I'm no older than you.
- Why aren't you with the others?

85
00:11:24,305 --> 00:11:26,381
They're afraid of me.

86
00:11:26,428 --> 00:11:28,336
Why are they afraid of you?

87
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:32,408
Because I read the stars and the sky
and the sun and the moon.

88
00:11:32,446 --> 00:11:33,998
You're a witch.

89
00:11:34,045 --> 00:11:38,837
I had a vision yesterday
that he would be born.

90
00:11:38,882 --> 00:11:41,207
- Who?
- The Great King.

91
00:11:41,248 --> 00:11:44,130
Stay back.
I was born ten years ago.

92
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,592
No.

93
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:50,315
You were born yesterday,
on the steppes.

94
00:11:51,648 --> 00:11:53,830
Ah, yes.

95
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,792
Yesterday, on the steppes.

96
00:12:02,433 --> 00:12:05,552
Some say it takes months
to make a bow.

97
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:10,045
But... it takes 15 years.

98
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,418
It starts when the tree
is first planted.

99
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:18,430
You cut the wood too soon,
the bow lacks strength,

100
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,581
too late, it becomes brittle.

101
00:12:20,627 --> 00:12:23,996
King Rua... We found them.

102
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:36,625
Are these the men
that attacked your camp?

103
00:12:41,257 --> 00:12:43,130
They're yours.

104
00:12:43,171 --> 00:12:45,981
You do with them what you will.

105
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:52,307
- There were more of them.
- They were killed. These remain.

106
00:12:57,051 --> 00:13:00,728
- Kneel.
- Kneel to a boy?

107
00:13:00,773 --> 00:13:02,955
Submit to me and live.

108
00:14:03,497 --> 00:14:07,908
Attila!
Have you spoken to the scouts?

109
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:11,389
They saw no force of any kind
between us and the river.

110
00:14:11,463 --> 00:14:13,123
Good.

111
00:14:32,858 --> 00:14:35,111
IMPERIAL PRISON
ROME

112
00:14:45,938 --> 00:14:48,014
You should be used to it by now.

113
00:14:48,061 --> 00:14:50,172
We guards eat the same food.

114
00:14:50,253 --> 00:14:52,753
It's slave food.

115
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,981
Only a slave could get used to it.

116
00:15:14,987 --> 00:15:16,967
Aaargh!

117
00:15:29,807 --> 00:15:32,203
I am Flavius Aetius.

118
00:15:33,946 --> 00:15:36,022
Rome endures.

119
00:15:38,086 --> 00:15:40,161
I will endure.

120
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:46,949
Parthians, Scythians,

121
00:15:46,992 --> 00:15:51,748
Macedonians, Picts, Gauls, Britons,
Angles, Franks, Jews, Egyptians.

122
00:15:51,793 --> 00:15:54,389
The list of defeated peoples
is endless.

123
00:15:54,436 --> 00:15:58,041
- Why are Huns different?
- They simply are, Majesty.

124
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:03,094
- Wait till they face Roman troops.
- They've defeated us before.

125
00:16:03,133 --> 00:16:06,466
From the Eastern Empire.
We're made of different stuff.

126
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:10,672
- We have no troops near the border.
- Send them from somewhere else.

127
00:16:10,718 --> 00:16:13,835
Not possible.
We're overextended as it is.

128
00:16:15,865 --> 00:16:20,028
Is it serious? The Huns
have been a nuisance for decades.

129
00:16:20,076 --> 00:16:24,595
- They've crossed into our territory.
- They're isolated raids.

130
00:16:24,634 --> 00:16:29,745
And when they realize how little
resistance we can offer, what then?

131
00:16:30,826 --> 00:16:34,502
Placidia, one man
might be able to deal with them.

132
00:16:34,547 --> 00:16:36,657
Aetius will not leave prison alive.

133
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,336
He knows their customs,
knows their king.

134
00:16:39,383 --> 00:16:41,292
I said no.

135
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,303
Felix, I know my son is...

136
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:49,600
immature, but he is learning.

137
00:16:49,645 --> 00:16:51,721
He's emperor now,

138
00:16:51,768 --> 00:16:56,286
and he'll rise to the occasion
as other emperors have before him.

139
00:16:57,578 --> 00:17:00,696
There! I did it!

140
00:17:00,742 --> 00:17:06,092
What shall I hit?
That vase sitting on the pedestal?

141
00:17:12,014 --> 00:17:13,852
Idiot!

142
00:17:13,894 --> 00:17:16,395
He's ruined my shot!

143
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,797
I'll think about what you said,

144
00:17:19,842 --> 00:17:23,969
but I have to be convinced that
the Huns are a serious threat.

145
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,523
Invaders! Invaders!

146
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,464
Go! Get moving!

147
00:20:57,165 --> 00:20:59,631
Wait! Your name?

148
00:21:02,696 --> 00:21:04,083
N'Kara.

149
00:21:06,209 --> 00:21:07,905
You fight bravely.

150
00:21:11,742 --> 00:21:14,802
Put her with the slaves.

151
00:21:14,837 --> 00:21:17,576
Her sword was the bloodiest of all.

152
00:21:22,943 --> 00:21:26,347
If she has kin, spare them as well.

153
00:22:01,175 --> 00:22:03,083
You may leave.

154
00:22:09,176 --> 00:22:12,853
I once swore you'd never
leave this prison alive,

155
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:16,159
but your friends have
begged me to be merciful.

156
00:22:16,204 --> 00:22:18,280
In the light of their plea...

157
00:22:18,327 --> 00:22:23,533
There's only one conceivable
reason for you to be here.

158
00:22:23,579 --> 00:22:26,768
- You need me.
- Why would I need you?

159
00:22:26,814 --> 00:22:30,112
If I had to guess,
I'd say the Huns are on the move,

160
00:22:30,154 --> 00:22:33,759
and you and the rest of Rome
are petrified with fear.

161
00:22:34,607 --> 00:22:37,560
There have been reports
of a new warlord...

162
00:22:38,643 --> 00:22:42,247
among the southern tribes - Attila.
Do you know him?

163
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:46,078
No, but I know King Rua,
and that's what matters.

164
00:22:46,122 --> 00:22:50,498
My son is young. He needs someone
to guide his decisions.

165
00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:54,501
You can serve your country
instead of your own ambitions,

166
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:58,015
- if that's possible.
- Anything's possible.

167
00:22:59,064 --> 00:23:00,865
What's your price?

168
00:23:00,906 --> 00:23:03,122
First, a full pardon.

169
00:23:03,167 --> 00:23:08,208
You tried to depose me, before
my son became of age. That's treason.

170
00:23:08,247 --> 00:23:10,572
Let's call that a misunderstanding.

171
00:23:16,631 --> 00:23:18,327
What else?

172
00:23:19,414 --> 00:23:21,701
Full restoration of my estates,

173
00:23:21,745 --> 00:23:24,317
personal staff, hand-picked by me,

174
00:23:24,354 --> 00:23:25,907
and...

175
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:31,791
reinstatement to the rank
of master of both services.

176
00:23:32,843 --> 00:23:36,697
If I am to deal with the Huns,
I must have the supreme command.

177
00:23:36,739 --> 00:23:39,929
- Felix has the supreme command.
- Remove him.

178
00:23:39,974 --> 00:23:43,377
- He recommended your release.
- I'll thank him.

179
00:23:43,417 --> 00:23:47,342
- You can rot in this cell forever.
- And you?

180
00:23:47,383 --> 00:23:50,408
You can find someone else
to deal with the Huns.

181
00:23:54,098 --> 00:23:55,830
Warden.

182
00:23:59,803 --> 00:24:02,091
Release him.

183
00:24:07,213 --> 00:24:10,331
He is your new supreme commander.

184
00:24:28,294 --> 00:24:31,663
The guard who brought me
my food, what's his name?

185
00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:33,779
Petronius, my lord.

186
00:24:49,098 --> 00:24:51,423
- Father!
- Lydia.

187
00:24:52,473 --> 00:24:55,568
Oh, you're really free!

188
00:24:55,604 --> 00:24:57,679
Oh, I was afraid to believe it.

189
00:24:57,726 --> 00:25:01,403
I came to the prison
but they wouldn't let me see you.

190
00:25:01,449 --> 00:25:05,267
My God, look at you.

191
00:25:06,318 --> 00:25:10,588
You're a young woman,
and a lovely one at that.

192
00:25:15,155 --> 00:25:17,302
The villa's really ours again?

193
00:25:18,286 --> 00:25:19,946
Yes.

194
00:25:19,991 --> 00:25:22,730
And the one in Sicily too.

195
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:26,418
Tomorrow I'll bring in workers.

196
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:30,767
It'll be as beautiful as ever.

197
00:25:34,601 --> 00:25:39,227
Come on, move!
You wretches, move!

198
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,819
Ha, ha, you're in my lot now!

199
00:25:49,595 --> 00:25:51,362
King Rua,

200
00:25:51,404 --> 00:25:54,179
I bring you tribute from our victory.

201
00:25:55,509 --> 00:25:59,957
A victory over farmers?

202
00:26:02,085 --> 00:26:04,516
The people are watching.

203
00:26:04,555 --> 00:26:08,859
You are brothers!
Embrace like brothers.

204
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:27,957
Let us see the treasures
that Attila has brought us!

205
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:37,389
Attila, don't let your brother's
envy spoil your victory.

206
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,897
He's right.

207
00:26:39,935 --> 00:26:43,647
It was a village defended
by peasants and farmers.

208
00:26:43,692 --> 00:26:47,581
We fight peasants
because no one else dare fight us!

209
00:26:47,622 --> 00:26:49,674
Yes. Not even the Romans.

210
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:54,679
- Rome? That's a different matter.
- We are Huns. We fear no one.

211
00:26:54,719 --> 00:26:56,308
True.

212
00:26:56,354 --> 00:27:00,244
But, uh, why wake a sleeping lion?

213
00:27:02,651 --> 00:27:06,717
We were 50 leagues
into their territory.

214
00:27:06,756 --> 00:27:10,160
There were no legions,
no soldiers. Not one.

215
00:27:12,287 --> 00:27:16,592
Let me take a larger army
and go further.

216
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:20,277
- How much further?
- To Rome itself.

217
00:27:21,819 --> 00:27:26,018
What will you do when you get there?
Scratch against the walls?

218
00:27:26,064 --> 00:27:28,139
They're wide as wagons,

219
00:27:28,184 --> 00:27:30,888
but they're made of stone,
not of wood!

220
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:52,910
I scared you.
Galen scared the great Attila.

221
00:27:52,955 --> 00:27:56,774
- I could have killed you.
- What did you bring Galen?

222
00:27:56,816 --> 00:27:59,770
- Nothing.
- Attila always brings something.

223
00:27:59,809 --> 00:28:02,441
- You did, didn't you?
- Maybe.

224
00:28:02,488 --> 00:28:05,891
Did you have another vision
while I was gone?

225
00:28:05,931 --> 00:28:10,580
- Maybe. What did you bring me?
- And no more about the god of war?

226
00:28:10,627 --> 00:28:14,624
That vision has been in our tribe
since we crossed the great marsh.

227
00:28:14,663 --> 00:28:18,339
After a hard battle,
the war god fell asleep.

228
00:28:18,385 --> 00:28:20,567
His sword dropped from his hand.

229
00:28:20,612 --> 00:28:23,209
Whoever finds it will rule the world.

230
00:28:23,256 --> 00:28:25,616
You must believe it, Attila.

231
00:28:25,657 --> 00:28:27,245
Why?

232
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:31,074
Because when you're
in my visions, so is the sword.

233
00:28:31,117 --> 00:28:34,521
A handle of gold and ivory,
crowned with rubies.

234
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,856
I won't even rule the tribe.

235
00:28:37,902 --> 00:28:41,614
When my uncle dies,
Bleda will be king.

236
00:28:41,659 --> 00:28:45,478
Bleda's not in my visions. You are.

237
00:28:49,243 --> 00:28:51,815
Go away, woman!

238
00:28:51,851 --> 00:28:54,176
Leave me alone.

239
00:28:54,217 --> 00:28:56,577
To think of the red-haired woman.

240
00:28:58,079 --> 00:28:59,952
The whole tribe knows.

241
00:28:59,992 --> 00:29:03,217
A red-haired woman
has caught Attila's eye.

242
00:29:03,262 --> 00:29:05,729
A red-haired woman has caught...

243
00:29:19,996 --> 00:29:24,159
Tonight we celebrate
the victory of Attila,

244
00:29:24,205 --> 00:29:27,845
the first with Roman spoils.

245
00:29:29,736 --> 00:29:35,335
Bleda, as the eldest,
you take precedence, however.

246
00:29:36,449 --> 00:29:38,525
Choose wisely.

247
00:29:42,365 --> 00:29:46,078
Attila, your raid
has brought us many riches,

248
00:29:46,122 --> 00:29:48,659
and I commend you.

249
00:29:48,695 --> 00:29:50,532
Since I did not fight,

250
00:29:50,573 --> 00:29:53,242
I claim nothing of value.

251
00:29:54,436 --> 00:29:56,488
Only...

252
00:29:56,523 --> 00:30:00,127
an animal, unknown in these parts.

253
00:30:01,254 --> 00:30:08,834
A strange creature
with piercing eyes and red fur.

254
00:30:13,255 --> 00:30:15,164
Bring it in.

255
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:32,447
Later tonight,
I may start my own race.

256
00:30:32,494 --> 00:30:35,897
Huns with red hair.

257
00:31:01,751 --> 00:31:04,597
Attila, what are you doing?

258
00:31:04,639 --> 00:31:08,043
You can't kill Bleda. You can't!

259
00:31:09,335 --> 00:31:11,243
Not in Rua's tent,

260
00:31:11,282 --> 00:31:13,986
but when he comes out,
I will be waiting.

261
00:31:14,031 --> 00:31:16,284
No. Your time has not yet come.

262
00:31:16,327 --> 00:31:19,316
This morning I had another vision.

263
00:31:19,354 --> 00:31:23,101
Destiny has chosen you,
but only if you bide your time.

264
00:31:26,243 --> 00:31:28,354
I'm tired of your visions!

265
00:31:30,939 --> 00:31:33,119
No! I won't let you.

266
00:31:40,818 --> 00:31:43,249
A woman.

267
00:31:43,289 --> 00:31:46,348
Hey, Galen.

268
00:31:47,533 --> 00:31:51,636
If you fight with Bleda over a woman,
the tribe will turn its back on you.

269
00:31:51,672 --> 00:31:53,854
Even if you win, you lose.

270
00:31:53,899 --> 00:31:57,788
Go back to Rua's tent,
claim your share of the spoils,

271
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:00,190
claim the conquered village.

272
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:04,192
- Am I a farmer, that I need land?
- Claim the village.

273
00:32:04,231 --> 00:32:06,307
It was in my vision.

274
00:32:12,057 --> 00:32:13,372
Next!

275
00:32:19,641 --> 00:32:21,717
The horse shied.

276
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,817
You and your horse are one.

277
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,971
His mistake is your mistake.

278
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:33,008
The beast with red fur.

279
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:36,721
The toadstool who talks.

280
00:33:36,767 --> 00:33:39,792
Bleda mounts you
more often than he does his horse.

281
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:43,339
It is no choice of mine.
I'd sooner die than bed a Hun.

282
00:33:43,377 --> 00:33:45,429
Then why don't you?

283
00:33:47,204 --> 00:33:49,280
My sister and mother.

284
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:52,031
If I kill myself,
Bleda will kill them.

285
00:33:52,076 --> 00:33:54,018
They live because of Attila.

286
00:33:55,518 --> 00:33:59,930
I've seen the way he looks at you,
and the way you look at him.

287
00:34:02,408 --> 00:34:04,483
I belong to Bleda.

288
00:34:04,529 --> 00:34:08,419
A Hun doesn't possess a woman
until she bears his child.

289
00:34:10,026 --> 00:34:14,616
If you bear Bleda's,
Attila won't want you.

290
00:34:16,948 --> 00:34:18,786
And how can I help it?

291
00:34:20,983 --> 00:34:25,254
These seeds.
Swallow one every day.

292
00:34:25,298 --> 00:34:28,214
They will keep
little Bledas out of your womb.

293
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,529
Attila or Bleda?

294
00:34:32,568 --> 00:34:35,140
Bleda or Attila?

295
00:34:36,987 --> 00:34:39,797
I know who Galen would choose.

296
00:34:55,319 --> 00:34:58,059
We don't even know
if the Huns will attack again.

297
00:34:58,103 --> 00:35:00,084
Trust me, they will.

298
00:35:00,121 --> 00:35:02,408
I lived among them when I was young.

299
00:35:02,451 --> 00:35:04,324
How did that happen?

300
00:35:04,365 --> 00:35:07,211
There was a treaty,
an exchange of hostages.

301
00:35:07,252 --> 00:35:10,312
They are brave, strong,
and far from stupid.

302
00:35:10,349 --> 00:35:15,069
Is it true their women
walk around naked?

303
00:35:18,141 --> 00:35:21,854
They crossed the border
here above Cologne.

304
00:35:21,898 --> 00:35:23,665
They sacked 20 villages.

305
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:26,766
As I told Felix, we should
send troops to punish them.

306
00:35:26,803 --> 00:35:29,305
And as he told you,
we have none to send.

307
00:35:29,343 --> 00:35:33,862
If we pull legions from the west,
the Goths will pillage us instead.

308
00:35:33,901 --> 00:35:36,569
The Huns have violated
our territory,

309
00:35:36,613 --> 00:35:39,387
and therefore
insulted my divine person.

310
00:35:39,431 --> 00:35:41,304
The insult must be avenged.

311
00:35:41,344 --> 00:35:45,970
It was the Huns that drove the Goths
against us in the first place.

312
00:35:46,006 --> 00:35:47,844
And split the empire.

313
00:35:47,885 --> 00:35:51,632
That's why I rule the West
and Theodosius the East. I know.

314
00:35:51,677 --> 00:35:54,631
Yet your divine brain
does not grasp the point.

315
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:59,319
What we must avoid at all costs is
fighting the Huns and Goths at once.

316
00:36:09,176 --> 00:36:10,800
Mmm!

317
00:36:10,846 --> 00:36:14,035
Traitor. I'm your sister.
You're supposed to help me.

318
00:36:14,116 --> 00:36:15,954
You wanted to be kissed.

319
00:36:19,194 --> 00:36:20,996
Flavius Aetius.

320
00:36:23,161 --> 00:36:25,236
The divine Honoria.

321
00:36:25,282 --> 00:36:28,128
I hope you're
behaving yourself, Aetius.

322
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:32,298
If you don't, Mummy said
she'll throw you right back in jail.

323
00:36:32,345 --> 00:36:34,005
Forever.

324
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:36,030
Mummy will have her joke.

325
00:36:37,911 --> 00:36:42,288
- Shall we continue, divine one?
- We're going to the Forum.

326
00:36:42,329 --> 00:36:44,902
Pritella's daughters
will be there.

327
00:36:46,017 --> 00:36:47,783
We'll finish later.

328
00:36:47,825 --> 00:36:51,715
I have to talk with Mummy, anyway.
Later, Aetius.

329
00:36:51,756 --> 00:36:54,567
I... command it.

330
00:36:57,254 --> 00:36:59,125
Goodbye, Mummy.

331
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:04,554
Where is my son going?

332
00:37:04,594 --> 00:37:06,776
To the Forum.

333
00:37:06,855 --> 00:37:10,009
He needs rest
from his intellectual labors.

334
00:37:10,054 --> 00:37:13,079
- But he is progressing?
- No.

335
00:37:13,117 --> 00:37:17,636
Nevertheless, whatever steps
you take, you will take through him.

336
00:37:18,682 --> 00:37:21,279
After he obtains your approval.

337
00:37:25,048 --> 00:37:27,479
Some things need immediate attention.

338
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:30,365
Training of troops,
stockpiling of supplies.

339
00:37:30,407 --> 00:37:32,483
See to that on your own.

340
00:37:32,529 --> 00:37:35,066
- It would help if I had your seal.
- Why?

341
00:37:35,102 --> 00:37:38,778
Three years in prison
have destroyed my reputation.

342
00:37:38,825 --> 00:37:41,494
I need proof
that I act on your behalf.

343
00:37:43,069 --> 00:37:45,737
The Huns are at our border, Placidia.

344
00:37:45,782 --> 00:37:49,423
We must both forget old hatreds.

345
00:37:58,203 --> 00:38:00,313
Petronius...

346
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:05,953
Don't worry.
If I wanted you dead, you would be.

347
00:38:05,995 --> 00:38:09,149
I beg you,
forgive my foolishness.

348
00:38:09,195 --> 00:38:11,247
I was not well in the head.

349
00:38:12,988 --> 00:38:15,205
How does your head feel now?

350
00:38:15,248 --> 00:38:18,546
Ready for whatever service
you require, my lord.

351
00:38:18,589 --> 00:38:20,603
Good.

352
00:38:20,675 --> 00:38:23,307
I require you to kill someone.

353
00:38:23,354 --> 00:38:25,086
Who is it, my lord?

354
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,568
The Emperor Valentinian.

355
00:38:34,034 --> 00:38:37,782
It's all arranged. You'll be gone
before anyone knows.

356
00:38:40,018 --> 00:38:43,943
Ten gold talents now,
ten after it's done.

357
00:38:44,018 --> 00:38:45,678
A fortune.

358
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:49,756
- I'll be a hunted man forever.
- No, no, no.

359
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:53,234
The Emperor's mother herself
will protect you.

360
00:38:53,273 --> 00:38:56,747
She's tasted power.
She doesn't want to give it up.

361
00:39:00,821 --> 00:39:02,517
Her seal.

362
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:07,209
She gave it to me for this purpose.
Keep it with you.

363
00:39:07,257 --> 00:39:10,518
If you're taken,
it'll be your protection.

364
00:39:16,894 --> 00:39:19,466
Tomorrow noon, the Garden of Corona.

365
00:39:19,503 --> 00:39:21,827
Use the south gate.

366
00:39:21,868 --> 00:39:24,193
I'll see that he's alone.

367
00:39:46,394 --> 00:39:48,896
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

368
00:39:53,142 --> 00:39:55,194
Halt.

369
00:40:01,492 --> 00:40:04,610
How dare you raise a weapon
against the Emperor!

370
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:12,962
I was walking by.
Thought he looked out of place.

371
00:40:13,008 --> 00:40:16,648
Thank God I followed him!
What are you doing here?

372
00:40:16,695 --> 00:40:20,336
I had an invitation from Mummy
to have a picnic.

373
00:40:25,113 --> 00:40:27,295
See if you can find out who he is.

374
00:40:38,995 --> 00:40:41,105
He carries my mother's seal.

375
00:40:41,151 --> 00:40:43,819
How is that possible?

376
00:40:45,465 --> 00:40:50,886
She invited me here... to be killed.

377
00:40:50,926 --> 00:40:52,977
No. Your own mother?

378
00:40:53,013 --> 00:40:55,124
I should have known!

379
00:40:56,458 --> 00:41:01,464
All this talk
of teaching me to be emperor

380
00:41:01,503 --> 00:41:03,861
was just to keep me off guard!

381
00:41:05,711 --> 00:41:08,308
I'll have that bitch boiled alive.

382
00:41:08,355 --> 00:41:10,822
No, no, no. Sire.

383
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:13,327
- You have no proof.
- Her seal!

384
00:41:13,365 --> 00:41:17,005
She'll say it was stolen
or she loaned it someone.

385
00:41:17,053 --> 00:41:21,157
She'll have an explanation.
Trust me. I know how she works.

386
00:41:21,192 --> 00:41:22,815
Yes.

387
00:41:22,862 --> 00:41:26,159
You've been
her victim too, haven't you?

388
00:41:26,201 --> 00:41:30,649
- All those years in prison.
- I am not important.

389
00:41:31,942 --> 00:41:35,583
Rome is, and you are Rome.

390
00:41:37,334 --> 00:41:39,206
Act wisely.

391
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:45,153
- What must I do?
- For now, nothing.

392
00:41:45,196 --> 00:41:50,687
When she finds out her scheme
has failed, she'll lay low.

393
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:55,875
We'll take care of her
when the time is right.

394
00:42:02,243 --> 00:42:05,646
I put myself in your hands.

395
00:42:12,262 --> 00:42:15,665
Attila, walk with Galen
in the woods.

396
00:42:15,706 --> 00:42:17,330
I'm tired.

397
00:42:17,375 --> 00:42:20,885
A short walk with your friend.
You won't regret it.

398
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:25,579
Woman...

399
00:42:28,333 --> 00:42:30,029
Where are you?

400
00:43:07,854 --> 00:43:09,514
Don't be afraid.

401
00:43:10,637 --> 00:43:12,545
I'm not afraid.

402
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:28,262
Go back.

403
00:43:28,308 --> 00:43:31,748
If my brother misses you,
you'll be punished.

404
00:43:31,788 --> 00:43:33,899
I don't care.

405
00:43:35,475 --> 00:43:36,969
Go back.

406
00:43:48,103 --> 00:43:51,922
Valentinian,
tell me what Rome is.

407
00:43:51,964 --> 00:43:54,146
A great city, a great country.

408
00:43:55,896 --> 00:43:57,911
Rome is a fire...

409
00:43:59,201 --> 00:44:01,668
a golden flame of power,

410
00:44:01,706 --> 00:44:05,868
of majesty, beauty, knowledge.

411
00:44:05,914 --> 00:44:09,768
For a thousand years,
she has been the light of the world.

412
00:44:09,811 --> 00:44:11,684
Go outside.

413
00:44:11,724 --> 00:44:13,668
Look around you.

414
00:44:15,551 --> 00:44:22,431
The Colosseum, the Senate,
Forum, theaters, markets, aqueducts,

415
00:44:22,474 --> 00:44:24,550
that bring water from 100 miles away

416
00:44:24,596 --> 00:44:27,620
so we can live like civilized
men instead of animals.

417
00:44:27,658 --> 00:44:33,707
Of course, you're saying
that Rome is rich,

418
00:44:33,745 --> 00:44:36,342
and we have to keep it that way.

419
00:44:38,512 --> 00:44:40,588
That's right.

420
00:44:40,634 --> 00:44:45,603
Tomorrow, I'll go to Ravenna and
take command of the Third Legion.

421
00:44:45,643 --> 00:44:48,239
It's two weeks' march
to the Hun border.

422
00:44:48,321 --> 00:44:50,609
I'll need Senate approval tonight.

423
00:44:50,653 --> 00:44:54,579
- Tonight? They're all asleep.
- You are the emperor.

424
00:44:54,619 --> 00:44:56,765
Wake them up.

425
00:44:58,062 --> 00:44:59,556
Yes!

426
00:45:00,637 --> 00:45:02,819
I will enjoy that.

427
00:45:02,864 --> 00:45:05,959
Darling, I haven't seen you all day.

428
00:45:05,996 --> 00:45:07,867
Valentinian?

429
00:45:09,021 --> 00:45:13,469
Thank you. It's proved very useful.
I'm finished with it now.

430
00:45:22,623 --> 00:45:25,292
Attila, you still want to go to Rome?

431
00:45:26,381 --> 00:45:28,456
If you're serious, yes.

432
00:45:28,502 --> 00:45:33,293
I'm serious. Then again, perhaps you
won't need to go to Rome after all.

433
00:45:33,372 --> 00:45:35,697
I received a message.

434
00:45:35,738 --> 00:45:40,673
It seems that Rome
is coming here, tomorrow.

435
00:46:13,067 --> 00:46:16,956
We know of your incursion
into our territory.

436
00:46:16,997 --> 00:46:22,003
Officially, I protest.
But that's not my true purpose.

437
00:46:22,042 --> 00:46:26,205
Our spies bring word that
the Goths plan to move against us.

438
00:46:26,252 --> 00:46:30,627
- Which tribe?
- The Visigoths west of the Rhine.

439
00:46:31,748 --> 00:46:34,523
Why not march your legion there?

440
00:46:34,565 --> 00:46:39,215
For your sake, Rua,
and the sake of our friendship.

441
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:43,496
Our spies tell us the Visigoths
plan to move against you as well.

442
00:46:43,541 --> 00:46:47,740
They've been paying tribute
to us for, uh...

443
00:46:47,786 --> 00:46:50,252
- Ten years.
- Ten years.

444
00:46:50,324 --> 00:46:52,920
And they hate you for it.

445
00:46:52,968 --> 00:46:58,116
Just as they hate us. They'll attack
you first to secure their rear,

446
00:46:58,152 --> 00:47:02,873
then us while we sit here
quibbling over a few border villages.

447
00:47:18,294 --> 00:47:20,238
He is of your tribe?

448
00:47:20,277 --> 00:47:22,981
The Visigoths tortured him.

449
00:47:23,026 --> 00:47:24,650
My spies saw it.

450
00:47:25,913 --> 00:47:29,387
Knowing the horse
is sacred to the Hun,

451
00:47:31,236 --> 00:47:34,605
they carved ten horses into his body
with heated knives,

452
00:47:34,644 --> 00:47:36,755
one for each year of tribute.

453
00:47:36,802 --> 00:47:38,853
It took him three days to die!

454
00:47:40,698 --> 00:47:43,723
There should be more blood.

455
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:49,632
These wounds were made after death.
Perhaps not by the Visigoths.

456
00:47:54,161 --> 00:47:59,546
A Roman general has better things
to do than mutilate corpses.

457
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:06,499
You've grown soft.

458
00:48:09,017 --> 00:48:13,914
The Huns I knew
would avenge such an insult.

459
00:48:13,955 --> 00:48:16,872
I came to offer an alliance.

460
00:48:16,912 --> 00:48:20,458
I'll march
against the Visigoths alone.

461
00:48:21,957 --> 00:48:23,202
Flavius!

462
00:48:26,062 --> 00:48:31,660
We, uh, divide the spoils equally?

463
00:48:31,698 --> 00:48:33,156
Of course.

464
00:48:34,238 --> 00:48:36,111
We'll join you.

465
00:48:37,994 --> 00:48:40,626
Make preparations, now!

466
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,615
Who was the outspoken one?

467
00:48:58,659 --> 00:49:01,683
My nephew, Attila.

468
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:05,539
Attila? I've heard of him.

469
00:49:05,582 --> 00:49:08,499
Yes. He's very ambitious.

470
00:49:09,617 --> 00:49:12,841
Why, the other day,
he spoke of invading Rome.

471
00:49:12,886 --> 00:49:14,867
Did he?

472
00:49:15,948 --> 00:49:19,874
I raised him and his brother
since they were children.

473
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:22,512
They hated each other
from the first.

474
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:26,520
There is the source
of their latest conflict.

475
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:29,061
A slave girl?

476
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:32,253
Bleda claimed her
just to spite Attila.

477
00:49:33,899 --> 00:49:38,619
If they don't fight over her,
they'll find some other reason.

478
00:49:39,709 --> 00:49:42,804
Why not put Attila under my command?

479
00:49:42,841 --> 00:49:45,581
You'd have peace for a time,
at any rate.

480
00:50:00,721 --> 00:50:04,267
They march well, but can they fight?

481
00:50:04,305 --> 00:50:07,982
I sense you'd rather fight
against us than with us.

482
00:50:09,105 --> 00:50:13,100
I've seen much Roman arrogance
but little Roman power.

483
00:50:16,688 --> 00:50:20,994
Sentries are set, General. The
enemy is a league west of the Rhine.

484
00:50:21,038 --> 00:50:24,963
Wake the camp
after the third watch, quietly.

485
00:50:25,003 --> 00:50:27,256
We'll occupy the rise at dawn.

486
00:50:27,299 --> 00:50:31,332
- The Huns will cut off any retreat.
- Yes, General.

487
00:50:43,581 --> 00:50:46,284
The dead man in Rua's tent...

488
00:50:47,407 --> 00:50:50,882
The Visigoths
had nothing to do with it.

489
00:50:50,956 --> 00:50:54,015
And you handled it very badly.

490
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:56,446
You should have waited
till I was gone,

491
00:50:56,486 --> 00:50:58,597
and you should have seemed puzzled.

492
00:50:58,644 --> 00:51:02,950
"If he were tortured while alive,
why isn't there more blood?"

493
00:51:02,992 --> 00:51:08,139
Rua realizes the answer for himself
and is more likely to believe it.

494
00:51:08,175 --> 00:51:10,606
Trickery and deceit...

495
00:51:11,655 --> 00:51:14,429
That's the way of the Romans,
not of the Huns.

496
00:51:14,507 --> 00:51:17,424
Which way rules the world?

497
00:51:51,871 --> 00:51:55,474
A Frankish tribe must have
joined the Visigoths overnight.

498
00:51:55,522 --> 00:51:57,989
- We've just seen their standards.
- How many?

499
00:51:58,027 --> 00:52:00,079
Their numbers have doubled.

500
00:52:13,057 --> 00:52:15,973
- Everything is ready?
- Yes, Father.

501
00:52:16,013 --> 00:52:18,681
- They have the high ground.
- Yes.

502
00:52:18,726 --> 00:52:22,331
But have they realized yet
what they're up against?

503
00:52:39,843 --> 00:52:44,528
At the first trumpet, the center
falls back, feigns a retreat.

504
00:52:44,574 --> 00:52:47,076
The second, they turn and fight.

505
00:52:47,114 --> 00:52:51,669
The third,
the Huns attack the enemy flank.

506
00:52:51,706 --> 00:52:53,781
Yes, General.

507
00:52:59,255 --> 00:53:03,383
Take the message to Attila.
He attacks at the third trumpet.

508
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,338
Yes, General.

509
00:53:07,082 --> 00:53:09,335
Prepare for the charge.

510
00:54:35,236 --> 00:54:37,737
Sound the first trumpet.

511
00:54:45,081 --> 00:54:46,883
They're retreating.

512
00:54:48,073 --> 00:54:50,148
Roman cowards.

513
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:54,638
No. It's a trick.

514
00:54:59,205 --> 00:55:01,280
Sound the second trumpet.

515
00:55:15,625 --> 00:55:17,285
The courier was killed.

516
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:20,448
- His body was found a furlong away.
- Send another.

517
00:55:20,496 --> 00:55:22,892
I did. But he
won't get there in time.

518
00:55:29,054 --> 00:55:32,043
He'll expect us to attack the flank.

519
00:55:34,411 --> 00:55:36,142
He sent no orders.

520
00:55:36,185 --> 00:55:38,237
Attack on my signal.

521
00:55:44,709 --> 00:55:46,238
Go! Go!

522
00:56:40,127 --> 00:56:44,953
With a few more like him, Rome could
conquer the world all over again.

523
00:57:04,234 --> 00:57:06,310
Theodoric.

524
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:08,467
It's been a long time,
Flavius Aetius.

525
00:57:08,514 --> 00:57:10,944
But the same result -
a Roman victory.

526
00:57:10,983 --> 00:57:15,775
- Your terms?
- A third of your men sold as slaves,

527
00:57:15,819 --> 00:57:20,337
2,000lbs of gold,
one half your fall harvest.

528
00:57:20,376 --> 00:57:22,248
Do you mean to starve us?

529
00:57:22,288 --> 00:57:25,205
Would you prefer my legions
burn the entire harvest?

530
00:57:25,246 --> 00:57:28,615
You would never dare
without the Huns at your back.

531
00:57:28,655 --> 00:57:32,544
Do you accept the terms,
or shall hostilities continue?

532
00:57:34,292 --> 00:57:36,165
I accept the terms.

533
00:57:37,423 --> 00:57:41,420
Aetius. The girl is well?

534
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,709
I told you before.

535
00:57:43,753 --> 00:57:48,130
Lydia is no concern
of yours and never will be.

536
00:57:53,811 --> 00:57:56,277
You knew each other from before?

537
00:57:56,314 --> 00:57:58,391
Theodoric?

538
00:58:00,282 --> 00:58:02,357
Yes, our paths have crossed.

539
00:58:04,108 --> 00:58:06,219
You hate each other.

540
00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:11,272
Strange as it may seem, we
were once married to the same woman.

541
00:58:11,311 --> 00:58:13,564
She died years ago. He blames me.

542
00:58:16,914 --> 00:58:22,606
So this fight was for Rome...
and to settle a grudge of your own.

543
00:58:22,653 --> 00:58:24,730
I strive for efficiency.

544
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:30,375
You Romans play with kings and
nations as a child plays with toys.

545
00:58:36,954 --> 00:58:39,207
I go back to Rome soon.

546
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:41,194
Come with me.

547
00:58:41,234 --> 00:58:43,973
Learn how the world is ruled.

548
00:58:44,017 --> 00:58:48,608
See if Rome really does play with
nations as though they were toys.

549
00:58:49,793 --> 00:58:54,870
There's no one like you in Rome
and no one like me here.

550
00:58:54,907 --> 00:58:56,983
Today was just the beginning.

551
00:58:58,039 --> 00:59:01,753
We could do great things
together, you and I.

552
00:59:03,536 --> 00:59:05,823
If we don't kill each other first.

553
00:59:10,426 --> 00:59:13,724
What do you say, Attila?
Will you come?

554
01:01:24,974 --> 01:01:28,485
Aetius, we congratulate you
on a great victory.

555
01:01:28,523 --> 01:01:31,025
The glory is yours, Caesar.

556
01:01:31,063 --> 01:01:32,972
I present Attila,

557
01:01:33,012 --> 01:01:37,318
whose courage and skill contributed
greatly to our conquest.

558
01:01:37,361 --> 01:01:41,489
Attila, we welcome you
as an ally and a friend.

559
01:01:41,536 --> 01:01:44,657
Let me introduce you
to some of our leading statesmen.

560
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:50,887
Gentlemen, this is Attila.

561
01:01:50,929 --> 01:01:54,050
He's quite striking,
in a primitive way.

562
01:01:54,097 --> 01:01:57,014
His clothes are made of animal skins.

563
01:01:57,055 --> 01:01:59,627
He'll have them off soon enough.

564
01:01:59,663 --> 01:02:02,439
Was it wise to bring him here?

565
01:02:02,483 --> 01:02:06,231
One day he'll be king
of the Huns' most powerful tribe.

566
01:02:06,275 --> 01:02:08,350
Then we should kill him.

567
01:02:08,396 --> 01:02:12,595
Then we'd be at war with the Huns,
just what we're trying to avoid.

568
01:02:12,642 --> 01:02:17,126
- Won't his elder brother be king?
- Attila will be king.

569
01:02:17,165 --> 01:02:22,207
Therefore, we'll seduce him with
wealth and treat him as a friend.

570
01:02:23,289 --> 01:02:26,278
And at the end
of all your scheming,

571
01:02:26,316 --> 01:02:29,162
- if he turns against us...
- He will not.

572
01:02:29,204 --> 01:02:33,332
It will be on your head, Aetius.

573
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:14,005
Grachia, congratulations
on your latest victory.

574
01:03:14,053 --> 01:03:18,501
Kind of Your Grace to take note.
And this must be Attila.

575
01:03:18,542 --> 01:03:22,326
Grachia is the current champion
of the Circus Maximus.

576
01:03:22,369 --> 01:03:26,437
- Finest charioteer in the empire.
- Come and watch me race.

577
01:03:26,475 --> 01:03:29,321
I'll make sure you have
the finest seat.

578
01:03:30,372 --> 01:03:33,561
A chariot driver at a royal banquet?

579
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:38,020
It's shameful how this city
fawns over athletes.

580
01:03:38,097 --> 01:03:40,670
Some of them
have more money than I do.

581
01:04:29,349 --> 01:04:31,256
It suits you nicely.

582
01:04:34,288 --> 01:04:37,587
I wear it tonight only.

583
01:04:37,629 --> 01:04:40,784
- I have another present.
- It's not necessary.

584
01:04:40,865 --> 01:04:42,940
I insist.

585
01:04:52,346 --> 01:04:54,457
What is this place?

586
01:04:54,504 --> 01:04:56,580
A bath.

587
01:04:57,565 --> 01:05:00,162
Go on, step in.

588
01:05:01,845 --> 01:05:04,443
You've never seen one?

589
01:05:06,090 --> 01:05:09,767
Aetius has only shown you
fortresses and aqueducts,

590
01:05:09,813 --> 01:05:14,190
but I think the bath
is Rome's greatest achievement.

591
01:05:21,852 --> 01:05:23,963
It's hot.

592
01:05:24,044 --> 01:05:25,502
Yes.

593
01:05:25,541 --> 01:05:27,522
That's the point.

594
01:05:28,881 --> 01:05:30,577
How's it done?

595
01:05:30,621 --> 01:05:33,502
A furnace, a few pipes.

596
01:05:33,542 --> 01:05:35,415
It doesn't matter.

597
01:05:35,456 --> 01:05:39,170
It's very soothing
once you get used to the heat.

598
01:05:40,710 --> 01:05:43,521
I had a feeling you might like it.

599
01:05:43,563 --> 01:05:46,518
I'm not as stupid as people think...

600
01:05:46,556 --> 01:05:48,632
as you probably think.

601
01:05:49,688 --> 01:05:54,965
It's just that brains don't
do a woman much good in Rome.

602
01:05:56,925 --> 01:05:59,001
Mummy's an exception.

603
01:06:00,056 --> 01:06:02,000
She had real power.

604
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:05,195
But she's made sure
that I never will.

605
01:06:06,284 --> 01:06:10,447
She favors my brother and has done
since the day he was born.

606
01:06:10,495 --> 01:06:14,314
He's a hopeless ninny,
but he's a man.

607
01:06:15,331 --> 01:06:16,990
So that's that.

608
01:06:18,913 --> 01:06:22,591
I say, if a woman can only
have power through a man,

609
01:06:22,638 --> 01:06:28,272
then let it be with the most
powerful man she can find.

610
01:06:56,074 --> 01:07:00,629
- Rua grows old.
- What do you want me to do?

611
01:07:01,711 --> 01:07:05,186
He likes to drink ale
in the mid morning.

612
01:07:06,096 --> 01:07:11,517
Put this in the bowl
next to his bed.

613
01:07:11,558 --> 01:07:15,484
He will die peacefully,
and you will live well.

614
01:07:36,783 --> 01:07:39,035
I was afraid you weren't coming.

615
01:07:39,078 --> 01:07:41,925
I have other things
to tend to besides you.

616
01:07:41,968 --> 01:07:44,186
I need mushrooms for my potions.

617
01:07:44,230 --> 01:07:47,872
Besides, Bleda hardly
touches you any more, anyway.

618
01:07:47,953 --> 01:07:49,576
Galen, wait.

619
01:07:49,622 --> 01:07:52,397
He's planning to have Rua murdered.

620
01:07:52,441 --> 01:07:54,207
Be quiet!

621
01:07:54,249 --> 01:07:58,034
You could be killed
for saying that, and I for hearing.

622
01:07:58,077 --> 01:08:01,409
Bleda bribed a guard to poison him.
I heard them.

623
01:08:01,486 --> 01:08:03,562
You have to do something.

624
01:08:03,609 --> 01:08:05,519
- What can I do?
- Warn Rua.

625
01:08:05,558 --> 01:08:08,998
- He wouldn't listen to me.
- Then use your powers.

626
01:08:09,038 --> 01:08:14,423
It may be best for us if Rua dies.

627
01:08:14,465 --> 01:08:16,825
And Bleda becomes king?

628
01:08:16,865 --> 01:08:20,126
- Where is Attila?
- Rome.

629
01:08:20,171 --> 01:08:22,674
- How long has he been there?
- Weeks.

630
01:08:22,712 --> 01:08:24,893
Why does he tarry?

631
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:28,934
I don't know.

632
01:08:28,974 --> 01:08:32,450
If there's one thing
that will bring him back,

633
01:08:32,489 --> 01:08:35,156
it's news of Rua's death.

634
01:08:36,210 --> 01:08:39,021
Attila must return.

635
01:08:40,108 --> 01:08:42,017
You love him.

636
01:08:42,057 --> 01:08:45,082
A woman who does not is blind.

637
01:08:46,163 --> 01:08:49,188
But he would never love a toadstool.

638
01:08:52,913 --> 01:08:56,210
- Why do you help me?
- You're in my visions.

639
01:08:56,253 --> 01:08:58,127
I must be true to them,

640
01:08:58,167 --> 01:09:02,093
and my visions tell me
Attila is in danger.

641
01:09:02,132 --> 01:09:05,252
He must return. Therefore,

642
01:09:05,299 --> 01:09:10,127
let today's king die
that tomorrow's may live.

643
01:09:19,704 --> 01:09:24,496
When you said Rome would seduce him,
I didn't know you meant my daughter.

644
01:09:24,541 --> 01:09:28,052
- I had nothing to do with it.
- It cannot continue.

645
01:09:28,089 --> 01:09:31,209
A marriage
would formalize the alliance.

646
01:09:31,255 --> 01:09:34,838
Married to a barbarian?
She'd be a laughing stock.

647
01:09:34,875 --> 01:09:39,358
I doubt it. But at least there'd be
a Rome to do the laughing.

648
01:09:39,396 --> 01:09:42,552
Spare me your speech
about sacrifices for the empire.

649
01:09:42,599 --> 01:09:47,117
- Like it or not, we must make them.
- She's not yours to barter with.

650
01:09:47,156 --> 01:09:50,632
An alliance with the Huns
will secure our borders,

651
01:09:50,671 --> 01:09:53,861
and buy us time to make
ourselves great again.

652
01:09:54,951 --> 01:09:58,425
If he'll have her, they will marry.

653
01:09:58,498 --> 01:10:00,645
Over my dead body.

654
01:10:00,691 --> 01:10:03,158
Well, if you insist.

655
01:10:13,112 --> 01:10:16,233
He puts too much faith
in his influence over Attila.

656
01:10:16,279 --> 01:10:18,355
Even if this marriage occurred

657
01:10:18,401 --> 01:10:21,733
the Huns might think it
a great joke to attack us anyway.

658
01:10:21,776 --> 01:10:24,694
- It must not occur.
- The girl is obsessed.

659
01:10:24,769 --> 01:10:27,200
It may require drastic measures.

660
01:10:28,631 --> 01:10:30,707
Then take them.

661
01:10:32,737 --> 01:10:36,899
And Aetius
has outlived his usefulness.

662
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:40,077
I understand.

663
01:10:45,053 --> 01:10:48,872
I never believed in destiny before,
but I do now.

664
01:10:48,916 --> 01:10:52,500
It was destiny
that brought us together.

665
01:10:52,535 --> 01:10:55,203
Do you believe in destiny, Attila?

666
01:10:55,249 --> 01:10:58,344
- Perhaps.
- Good.

667
01:10:58,379 --> 01:11:01,500
So many people
are so boringly virtuous.

668
01:11:01,546 --> 01:11:05,330
"The will of God" this
and "the will of God" that.

669
01:11:06,417 --> 01:11:09,122
Actually, I only know
one other person

670
01:11:09,201 --> 01:11:12,949
who really takes destiny seriously.

671
01:11:12,994 --> 01:11:14,867
Flavius Aetius.

672
01:11:14,907 --> 01:11:17,753
Strange, isn't it?

673
01:11:17,795 --> 01:11:22,278
I despise him but adore you.

674
01:11:23,466 --> 01:11:27,915
- What's his destiny?
- To save Rome, he says.

675
01:11:29,034 --> 01:11:31,286
And what's yours?

676
01:11:33,418 --> 01:11:36,335
A soothsayer in my village
says I'll find a sword.

677
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:38,734
And when you find it?

678
01:11:39,889 --> 01:11:42,356
I'll rule the world.

679
01:11:42,393 --> 01:11:44,860
How sad for Aetius.

680
01:11:44,899 --> 01:11:48,232
Aetius can take care of himself.

681
01:11:50,815 --> 01:11:53,554
If you'll excuse me.

682
01:11:57,704 --> 01:12:01,144
- What do you think of her?
- She's pleasing.

683
01:12:01,183 --> 01:12:03,852
That's all?

684
01:12:03,897 --> 01:12:06,742
What else is there to say of a woman?

685
01:12:06,784 --> 01:12:10,818
You've never loved, then.

686
01:12:10,856 --> 01:12:14,011
Once. Perhaps.

687
01:12:15,796 --> 01:12:19,199
The slave girl, the red-haired one.

688
01:12:21,850 --> 01:12:25,397
A man in your position
can have as many women as you wish.

689
01:12:25,435 --> 01:12:27,511
Those that you love...

690
01:12:27,557 --> 01:12:29,703
and those that are merely...

691
01:12:29,748 --> 01:12:31,824
useful.

692
01:12:31,871 --> 01:12:34,789
And if your destiny
is to conquer the world,

693
01:12:34,830 --> 01:12:38,507
you could do worse
than ally yourself with Rome.

694
01:12:38,552 --> 01:12:42,155
What if Rome is part of the world
I'm meant to conquer?

695
01:12:42,204 --> 01:12:45,882
Well, there are many ways to conquer.

696
01:12:45,928 --> 01:12:49,605
You captured Honoria
without striking a blow,

697
01:12:49,651 --> 01:12:53,364
and she may be the key
to your next conquest.

698
01:12:55,601 --> 01:12:59,871
To conquest, however achieved.

699
01:13:02,871 --> 01:13:06,097
Father, this message
was brought to the villa.

700
01:13:18,253 --> 01:13:19,984
Rua is dead.

701
01:13:22,879 --> 01:13:25,833
- I must leave at once.
- It's a bad season for travel.

702
01:13:25,871 --> 01:13:28,504
Bleda will be plotting against me.

703
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:32,334
Get a fresh start in the morning.
I'll send an escort.

704
01:13:32,377 --> 01:13:35,533
Send a messenger
to announce your return,

705
01:13:35,614 --> 01:13:39,884
but take a different route
to make assassination difficult.

706
01:13:39,928 --> 01:13:43,474
Challenge him quickly,
and have a reason besides ambition.

707
01:13:43,512 --> 01:13:47,439
- A pretext.
- Exactly.

708
01:13:47,479 --> 01:13:51,546
For example, you might
accuse him of murdering Rua.

709
01:13:51,584 --> 01:13:54,681
- The fact is, he probably did.
- I have no proof.

710
01:13:54,716 --> 01:13:58,191
It's no matter. It's good politics.

711
01:13:58,231 --> 01:14:00,732
It'll put him on the defensive.

712
01:14:01,814 --> 01:14:04,245
Attila...

713
01:14:04,284 --> 01:14:09,112
if things go badly, you know
you may always seek shelter here.

714
01:14:11,348 --> 01:14:13,600
I will live or die among the Huns.

715
01:14:16,706 --> 01:14:20,455
Then rest.
You have a long journey ahead of you.

716
01:14:33,024 --> 01:14:35,598
Have you been eavesdropping?

717
01:14:35,635 --> 01:14:38,030
No, learning.

718
01:14:39,113 --> 01:14:41,508
You'll miss him, won't you?

719
01:14:41,547 --> 01:14:43,623
Yes, I'll miss him.

720
01:14:43,671 --> 01:14:47,147
Rome produces
few such men these days.

721
01:14:48,263 --> 01:14:51,453
This Bleda,
will he really try to kill him?

722
01:14:51,499 --> 01:14:53,611
Of course.

723
01:14:54,875 --> 01:14:58,030
I'll say a prayer for him
before I go to sleep.

724
01:14:58,076 --> 01:14:59,771
Yes.

725
01:15:00,859 --> 01:15:03,112
Say one for Rome as well.

726
01:15:12,794 --> 01:15:14,870
Oh, I beg pardon, master.

727
01:15:14,916 --> 01:15:16,897
I thought you were leaving.

728
01:16:26,416 --> 01:16:28,255
Take him!

729
01:16:32,367 --> 01:16:34,478
Take him! Your king commands it!

730
01:16:39,257 --> 01:16:41,095
You are not yet king.

731
01:16:41,137 --> 01:16:43,284
Bring me my crown! Quickly!

732
01:16:43,328 --> 01:16:47,669
You see how he wants to steal
the crown, as he stole Rua's life?

733
01:16:47,711 --> 01:16:50,451
You lie.

734
01:16:50,495 --> 01:16:52,962
Rua should have died as he lived.

735
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,468
A warrior, not in his sleep.

736
01:16:55,506 --> 01:16:58,803
No man can choose
the manner of his own death.

737
01:16:58,845 --> 01:17:03,080
- No, not if he's murdered.
- Rua died without issue,

738
01:17:03,126 --> 01:17:05,830
and I am the elder son
of his brother.

739
01:17:05,874 --> 01:17:08,411
Therefore, I am the rightful king.

740
01:17:08,447 --> 01:17:13,003
To what purpose? To be paid
for fighting in the service of Rome

741
01:17:13,042 --> 01:17:14,915
or some other nation?

742
01:17:14,956 --> 01:17:17,625
We will live
as Huns have always lived.

743
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:20,410
What else should we do?

744
01:17:20,453 --> 01:17:22,635
We should rule the world!

745
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:25,110
You'd have us attack Rome?

746
01:17:27,725 --> 01:17:29,184
No.

747
01:17:29,221 --> 01:17:31,817
He has been bought off.

748
01:17:31,865 --> 01:17:36,765
Besides, he has a whore in Rome
who calls herself a princess.

749
01:17:41,747 --> 01:17:46,337
If we attack Rome,
we leave our flanks open.

750
01:17:46,374 --> 01:17:49,814
We will return
to find our villages burned

751
01:17:49,854 --> 01:17:52,072
and our women gone.

752
01:17:52,116 --> 01:17:55,033
You've said
what we should not do,

753
01:17:55,073 --> 01:17:57,813
but you've not said
what we should do.

754
01:17:59,527 --> 01:18:03,076
Attack north... Pannonia and beyond.

755
01:18:03,101 --> 01:18:06,006
- Attack our own people?!
- Not of our tribe.

756
01:18:06,055 --> 01:18:08,108
But Huns nonetheless,

757
01:18:08,156 --> 01:18:10,931
and we've been at peace
for many years.

758
01:18:10,974 --> 01:18:14,865
And war will come again,
as it always has.

759
01:18:17,726 --> 01:18:23,706
You all know the ancient prophecy.
A conqueror will rise among us.

760
01:18:23,747 --> 01:18:27,636
The one who finds
the war god's sword.

761
01:18:28,687 --> 01:18:30,977
Have you found this sword?

762
01:18:34,534 --> 01:18:35,992
No.

763
01:18:36,030 --> 01:18:38,842
Then your words are empty.

764
01:18:40,589 --> 01:18:42,949
I will give a different sign.

765
01:18:46,713 --> 01:18:49,596
I say you murdered Rua,

766
01:18:49,637 --> 01:18:52,519
and are not fit to take his place.

767
01:18:52,559 --> 01:18:55,548
And I say you lie.

768
01:18:55,586 --> 01:18:58,684
Then we'll meet tomorrow
when the sun awakens.

769
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:01,840
Let the strongest prevail.

770
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:05,292
And that will be the sign.

771
01:19:41,906 --> 01:19:44,302
He will tip his arrows with poison.

772
01:19:46,638 --> 01:19:50,457
If I die of poison, the tribe
will kill him. He knows that.

773
01:19:50,501 --> 01:19:53,621
This poison leaves no sign.

774
01:19:53,667 --> 01:19:56,374
How would Bleda get such a poison?

775
01:20:00,419 --> 01:20:01,664
You?

776
01:20:04,247 --> 01:20:05,908
Galen...

777
01:20:08,492 --> 01:20:10,818
What evil have you worked for him?

778
01:20:10,858 --> 01:20:12,625
Did he poison Rua?

779
01:20:12,669 --> 01:20:15,137
Bleda swore he'd kill me
if I didn't help.

780
01:20:15,174 --> 01:20:18,199
Besides, I knew it would
bring you back from Rome.

781
01:20:18,236 --> 01:20:21,011
- I would have come back anyway!
- My visions...

782
01:20:21,055 --> 01:20:23,902
- Your visions!
- I was right to do what I did.

783
01:20:23,943 --> 01:20:26,790
This time tomorrow you'll be king.

784
01:20:26,833 --> 01:20:29,465
- Give me some of your poison!
- I have none.

785
01:20:29,511 --> 01:20:33,474
There are no more mushrooms.
I've been looking for weeks.

786
01:20:35,775 --> 01:20:39,845
Then you've not only killed Rua,
you've killed me.

787
01:20:39,882 --> 01:20:44,188
No. If the poison enters you,
I'll draw it out.

788
01:20:44,232 --> 01:20:48,159
How? Will you be riding next to me
on a horse of your own?

789
01:20:48,199 --> 01:20:51,912
Attila, find the sword.

790
01:20:53,419 --> 01:20:56,609
If you have the sword,
nothing can touch you.

791
01:20:56,655 --> 01:21:00,546
Nobody has found it
in a hundred years.

792
01:21:00,587 --> 01:21:03,683
How am I supposed to find it
before sunrise?

793
01:21:19,378 --> 01:21:21,526
I'm through with you, woman.

794
01:21:23,938 --> 01:21:26,014
Never speak to me again.

795
01:22:22,923 --> 01:22:25,521
Hyah! Hyah! Come on!

796
01:22:39,243 --> 01:22:43,763
Powers of earth and sky, be true
to the visions you have shown me.

797
01:22:43,802 --> 01:22:48,666
Give Galen's strength to Attila
and Attila's pain to Galen.

798
01:23:32,208 --> 01:23:33,667
Hyah!

799
01:23:52,149 --> 01:23:53,393
Hah!

800
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:58,191
Ha. Ha.

801
01:24:37,492 --> 01:24:42,499
Give Galen's strength to Attila
and Attila's pain to Galen.

802
01:25:39,957 --> 01:25:42,590
- Hyah! Hyah!
- Hah!

803
01:26:31,321 --> 01:26:35,211
Attila! Attila! Attila!

804
01:29:13,144 --> 01:29:17,416
Aetius, what are the Huns up to?

805
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:20,935
Attila is attacking
to the north of Pannonia, sire.

806
01:29:20,975 --> 01:29:25,317
Didn't you say there were just...
just more Huns to the north?

807
01:29:26,333 --> 01:29:28,765
Then he's fighting his own people.

808
01:29:31,589 --> 01:29:34,091
Well done, Aetius.

809
01:29:34,128 --> 01:29:36,595
All to your greater glory, Majesty.

810
01:29:40,774 --> 01:29:44,144
You may fool an inexperienced youth,

811
01:29:44,185 --> 01:29:47,697
but you know that Attila
isn't just attacking the Huns.

812
01:29:47,736 --> 01:29:51,413
- He's uniting them.
- At least he's not fighting us.

813
01:29:51,459 --> 01:29:54,519
But if he ever does,
the danger is twice as great.

814
01:29:54,556 --> 01:29:56,610
He will not attack Rome.

815
01:29:56,645 --> 01:29:59,870
He'll attack the Germans,
the Eastern Empire, but not Rome.

816
01:29:59,915 --> 01:30:01,231
How can you be sure?

817
01:30:01,271 --> 01:30:04,368
In Rome, he saw things
he'd never dreamed of.

818
01:30:04,404 --> 01:30:06,515
I saw doubt grow in his eyes.

819
01:30:06,561 --> 01:30:10,488
He came certain he could defeat us.
He left uncertain.

820
01:30:10,529 --> 01:30:14,457
- And there's one other factor.
- What's that?

821
01:30:14,497 --> 01:30:17,379
Attacking Rome
would mean attacking me,

822
01:30:18,463 --> 01:30:21,203
and that, he will never do.

823
01:30:21,247 --> 01:30:26,219
- And if something happens to you?
- We'll have to see that it doesn't.

824
01:30:29,355 --> 01:30:31,503
Wine, anyone?

825
01:30:35,445 --> 01:30:38,018
We miss you, Galen.

826
01:30:38,055 --> 01:30:41,496
I wonder if
she still has her visions.

827
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:43,967
She had a vision about this place.

828
01:30:46,163 --> 01:30:50,363
- Near my old village.
- She's the reason I claimed it.

829
01:30:50,409 --> 01:30:52,982
That's why I buried her here.

830
01:31:04,294 --> 01:31:06,582
Will you go away again?

831
01:31:06,625 --> 01:31:09,401
It depends
what my scouts say.

832
01:31:09,445 --> 01:31:12,042
You'll attack
Constantinople?

833
01:31:12,089 --> 01:31:16,052
Not the city itself.
Not at first anyway.

834
01:31:17,135 --> 01:31:19,673
But the provinces are rich.

835
01:31:19,710 --> 01:31:21,786
Can't you postpone it?

836
01:31:23,574 --> 01:31:28,093
N'Kara, I have only
just begun to build my empire.

837
01:31:28,166 --> 01:31:30,598
I have to think of the future.

838
01:31:30,638 --> 01:31:33,105
I am thinking of the future.

839
01:31:33,142 --> 01:31:36,096
A king must teach
his prince how to govern.

840
01:31:36,135 --> 01:31:38,212
Prince?

841
01:31:39,860 --> 01:31:42,979
The midwives
confirmed it this morning.

842
01:31:47,758 --> 01:31:52,350
- I hope it will be a boy.
- Oh, it will! I know it will!

843
01:32:05,194 --> 01:32:07,270
Why doesn't he come?

844
01:32:09,473 --> 01:32:12,913
If he doesn't come soon,
you will die.

845
01:32:12,953 --> 01:32:16,702
A baby cannot be hurried,
even for a king.

846
01:32:16,747 --> 01:32:19,381
He will come when he comes.

847
01:32:24,124 --> 01:32:26,200
Just see that he comes safely!

848
01:32:40,272 --> 01:32:42,253
Oh, you gods.

849
01:32:44,028 --> 01:32:46,104
Make it a boy.

850
01:32:47,821 --> 01:32:49,804
Make it a boy.

851
01:32:49,841 --> 01:32:52,023
Make him strong.

852
01:32:54,887 --> 01:32:57,213
A boy, Your Majesty.

853
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:14,930
Yes.

854
01:33:16,010 --> 01:33:18,087
The son of a king.

855
01:33:22,309 --> 01:33:24,111
And N'Kara?

856
01:33:56,899 --> 01:33:58,976
N'Kara.

857
01:34:03,859 --> 01:34:05,696
You have your prince.

858
01:34:12,245 --> 01:34:14,322
Teach him well.

859
01:34:22,407 --> 01:34:24,068
No.

860
01:34:26,583 --> 01:34:28,007
No!

861
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:29,036
Was this part of your vision?!

862
01:35:29,082 --> 01:35:33,246
Was this part of your vision,
and you didn't tell me?!

863
01:35:34,303 --> 01:35:36,521
I curse you, Galen!

864
01:35:37,608 --> 01:35:41,809
And I curse you, gods!

865
01:37:05,965 --> 01:37:07,352
Kneel!

866
01:37:07,392 --> 01:37:10,547
Kneel before your new king.

867
01:37:11,811 --> 01:37:13,720
Submit to him!

868
01:38:43,228 --> 01:38:47,334
The messenger said
the campaign was successful.

869
01:38:47,371 --> 01:38:49,837
Yes. The city fell quickly.

870
01:38:49,875 --> 01:38:53,803
The new siege engines worked
even better than I'd hoped.

871
01:38:53,843 --> 01:38:55,919
I'm glad.

872
01:38:57,705 --> 01:39:00,303
- You're well?
- Yes.

873
01:39:00,350 --> 01:39:03,056
- You were obeyed in my absence?
- Yes.

874
01:39:05,606 --> 01:39:09,189
- And my other wives?
- Also well, my lord.

875
01:39:09,224 --> 01:39:11,300
Good.

876
01:39:12,912 --> 01:39:15,166
Where's my son?

877
01:39:15,210 --> 01:39:20,111
You have many sons, my lord.
Of which do you speak?

878
01:39:20,151 --> 01:39:21,847
The eldest.

879
01:39:22,935 --> 01:39:25,817
You have a dozen wives,

880
01:39:25,858 --> 01:39:28,361
twice that many children.

881
01:39:29,861 --> 01:39:32,493
And yet, all of us taken together

882
01:39:32,540 --> 01:39:35,113
don't pleasure you
as much as he does.

883
01:39:35,149 --> 01:39:39,669
- He's my first-born.
- And child of the red-haired woman.

884
01:39:40,892 --> 01:39:43,918
I hold court this afternoon.

885
01:39:43,954 --> 01:39:46,837
In the meantime, I wish to rest.

886
01:39:47,922 --> 01:39:49,060
Attila...

887
01:39:53,140 --> 01:39:55,014
I missed you.

888
01:39:56,551 --> 01:39:58,461
It's good to be back.

889
01:40:13,394 --> 01:40:15,470
Attila...

890
01:40:15,516 --> 01:40:17,876
King of the Huns,

891
01:40:17,918 --> 01:40:22,047
lord of all lands from
the frozen ocean to the Black Sea,

892
01:40:22,094 --> 01:40:26,022
from the River Rhine
to the mountains of the East.

893
01:40:38,241 --> 01:40:42,310
Our Great King graciously
gives you leave to rise.

894
01:40:50,282 --> 01:40:53,401
I am King Canute of the Finns.

895
01:40:53,447 --> 01:40:58,384
We welcome you as a friend
and as a loyal subject.

896
01:40:58,424 --> 01:41:04,618
I bring tribute. Furs, gold
and silver, spices and perfumes.

897
01:41:05,906 --> 01:41:08,967
In the name of my people,
I accept the tribute.

898
01:41:22,193 --> 01:41:24,625
I am King Meloch of the Parthians.

899
01:41:24,664 --> 01:41:27,997
I beg you to settle a dispute
between myself

900
01:41:28,039 --> 01:41:29,913
and King Omar of Scythia.

901
01:41:29,954 --> 01:41:33,464
- Concerning what?
- The boundary between our nations.

902
01:41:33,502 --> 01:41:35,862
- Where is Omar?
- He arrives tomorrow.

903
01:41:35,902 --> 01:41:39,059
Justice requires that
I hear both parties at once.

904
01:41:39,106 --> 01:41:41,679
Yes, but if you only...

905
01:41:43,594 --> 01:41:48,221
Yes... Great King. Tomorrow.

906
01:41:51,634 --> 01:41:54,408
Attila. Attila.

907
01:41:56,366 --> 01:41:58,026
Attila.

908
01:41:58,871 --> 01:42:02,833
He's all I hear about.
I thought we were finished with him.

909
01:42:02,873 --> 01:42:07,003
No such luck, Majesty. He's still
here and stronger than ever.

910
01:42:07,050 --> 01:42:09,552
As long as he doesn't trouble us.

911
01:42:09,590 --> 01:42:13,589
But he troubles the rest
of the world, and they trouble us.

912
01:42:13,627 --> 01:42:17,267
Pleas for help
from Scythia, Alericum, Moesia,

913
01:42:17,315 --> 01:42:19,782
and from Theodosius himself.

914
01:42:19,819 --> 01:42:22,596
"From Theodosius,
Emperor of the East,

915
01:42:22,640 --> 01:42:25,309
"to his beloved nephew,
Valentinian.

916
01:42:25,389 --> 01:42:29,173
"I beseech you, send aid,
we are overrun by the Huns. "

917
01:42:29,216 --> 01:42:30,877
Overrun.

918
01:42:30,922 --> 01:42:35,335
He exaggerates. The walls of
Constantinople are 20 feet thick.

919
01:42:35,376 --> 01:42:38,437
But dozens of smaller cities
have fallen.

920
01:42:38,474 --> 01:42:40,762
The provinces are stripped bare.

921
01:42:40,804 --> 01:42:45,252
Attila demands 3,000lbs of gold
to remove his troops.

922
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:52,072
A Roman emperor, subject to
extortion like a common shopkeeper.

923
01:42:52,115 --> 01:42:54,889
And if
Constantinople falls,

924
01:42:54,932 --> 01:42:59,167
there will be nothing left
for Attila to conquer but us.

925
01:42:59,213 --> 01:43:03,413
Aetius, you said if he threatened
the West it would be on your head.

926
01:43:03,459 --> 01:43:05,713
Do you begin to feel the weight?

927
01:43:18,179 --> 01:43:20,646
Well, Aetius?

928
01:43:22,147 --> 01:43:26,310
Once before, when Attila threatened,
I took a journey to meet him.

929
01:43:26,357 --> 01:43:29,726
- I propose to take another.
- To the Eastern Empire?

930
01:43:29,767 --> 01:43:31,500
Yes.

931
01:43:31,544 --> 01:43:35,398
I'll assess the situation
and deal with it personally.

932
01:43:35,439 --> 01:43:36,992
Yes.

933
01:43:37,597 --> 01:43:40,859
Good idea. Go immediately.

934
01:43:48,804 --> 01:43:53,217
- A word, Majesty, about your sister.
- What about her?

935
01:43:53,258 --> 01:43:55,890
It is rumored
that she's plotting against you.

936
01:43:55,936 --> 01:43:57,881
What? With whom?

937
01:43:57,920 --> 01:44:00,875
- With Eugenius, sire.
- Eugenius?

938
01:44:02,653 --> 01:44:06,473
- Not Eugenius her chamberlain?
- The same, sire.

939
01:44:08,535 --> 01:44:13,054
Honoria is conspiring against me...

940
01:44:13,093 --> 01:44:15,562
with a butler?!

941
01:44:20,922 --> 01:44:23,141
You are a goddess.

942
01:44:23,219 --> 01:44:26,623
We'll avoid killing him
if possible.

943
01:44:26,665 --> 01:44:29,299
He's a dolt, but he is my brother.

944
01:44:29,344 --> 01:44:31,492
I've never known such passion.

945
01:44:32,616 --> 01:44:36,648
Perhaps the fall festival
would be the best time to strike.

946
01:44:36,686 --> 01:44:40,364
No, Latorius doesn't think so.
He says it's too soon.

947
01:44:40,410 --> 01:44:42,912
You spoke of our plans to Latorius?

948
01:44:42,950 --> 01:44:45,868
We need an officer
of the guard on our side.

949
01:44:46,952 --> 01:44:49,799
My beautiful, stupid Eugenius.

950
01:44:50,711 --> 01:44:54,779
We must keep everything secret
until we are ready to...

951
01:45:03,064 --> 01:45:07,715
You should be leaving soon, Father.
The tide goes out at sunset.

952
01:45:07,763 --> 01:45:11,238
- News?
- Yes. Honoria's coming with me.

953
01:45:11,277 --> 01:45:13,566
She's been exiled to the East.

954
01:45:13,609 --> 01:45:15,757
She might have been executed.

955
01:45:15,802 --> 01:45:20,593
She'll probably wish she had been.
She's been given to Pulcheria.

956
01:45:20,637 --> 01:45:24,565
- I almost feel sorry for her.
- So do I, almost.

957
01:45:24,605 --> 01:45:27,275
If you see Attila,
remember me to him.

958
01:45:27,321 --> 01:45:31,105
Placidia was right.
I should have had him killed here.

959
01:45:31,148 --> 01:45:33,509
He was a guest in our home.

960
01:45:33,549 --> 01:45:37,747
Yes, well, I have to see
how dangerous he's become.

961
01:45:39,464 --> 01:45:41,482
Take care while I'm away.

962
01:45:41,518 --> 01:45:43,594
I will.

963
01:45:48,199 --> 01:45:51,320
- Did you meet with the ambassador?
- Briefly.

964
01:45:51,366 --> 01:45:54,913
The longer I put him off,
the more gold he's willing to pay.

965
01:45:55,995 --> 01:45:59,185
And yet, is that a gain
worthy of a great king?

966
01:45:59,231 --> 01:46:02,777
I have long ears, sire,
the better to serve you,

967
01:46:02,815 --> 01:46:05,732
and they've heard talk
among your generals.

968
01:46:05,773 --> 01:46:09,286
Their loyalty is absolute,
yet they wonder.

969
01:46:09,323 --> 01:46:11,399
We've conquered a hundred nations,

970
01:46:11,446 --> 01:46:14,850
pressed the Eastern Empire
to Constantinople,

971
01:46:14,891 --> 01:46:18,746
- yet do not move against the West.
- The time is not right.

972
01:46:18,788 --> 01:46:21,978
- When will it be right, sire?
- When I say it is.

973
01:46:23,451 --> 01:46:26,025
What other reason is given, Orestes?

974
01:46:29,645 --> 01:46:32,836
Some say, sire, that you fear Aetius.

975
01:46:34,831 --> 01:46:38,022
Forgive me, sire. A foolish rumor.

976
01:46:39,529 --> 01:46:42,032
Who spreads this rumor?

977
01:46:43,844 --> 01:46:45,920
- You, Great King.
- I?

978
01:46:45,966 --> 01:46:48,955
Yes, by your refusal
to move against the West.

979
01:46:51,222 --> 01:46:54,936
You have courage, Orestes.

980
01:46:54,980 --> 01:46:58,908
I would not serve you if I
did not dare to speak the truth.

981
01:47:00,896 --> 01:47:06,733
I am ruler, not only of the Huns,
but of the hundred nations.

982
01:47:06,777 --> 01:47:11,855
- Whose kings obey your commands.
- I need more than their obedience.

983
01:47:11,893 --> 01:47:14,111
- I need their belief.
- In what, sire?

984
01:47:14,154 --> 01:47:16,028
That's what I wait for.

985
01:47:16,069 --> 01:47:20,719
The thing that will make them
not merely serve, but believe.

986
01:47:22,505 --> 01:47:27,334
- A sign, like the war god's sword?
- A sign or a reason.

987
01:47:28,422 --> 01:47:30,782
What Aetius used to call a pretext.

988
01:47:30,823 --> 01:47:33,326
And when it comes, I will know,

989
01:47:33,364 --> 01:47:37,255
and then I will move
against the Western Empire.

990
01:47:37,296 --> 01:47:38,090
Yes, sire.

991
01:47:40,741 --> 01:47:42,818
CONSTANTINOPLE
CAPITAL OF THE EASTERN EMPIRE

992
01:47:54,174 --> 01:47:57,128
Aetius, welcome to the East.

993
01:47:57,167 --> 01:47:59,493
Thank you, Majesty.

994
01:47:59,568 --> 01:48:02,971
I have kept your arrival secret,
as you requested.

995
01:48:03,012 --> 01:48:05,231
It suits my purpose. Thank you.

996
01:48:07,223 --> 01:48:11,850
And Honoria, I have not seen you
since you were six years old.

997
01:48:11,887 --> 01:48:14,425
It pains me
that you grew up to be a traitor.

998
01:48:14,461 --> 01:48:18,982
Fortunately, my sister Pulcheria
has agreed to take you in.

999
01:48:19,021 --> 01:48:20,823
Take me in to what?

1000
01:48:21,665 --> 01:48:26,423
Into a life dedicated to celibacy
and to the works of God.

1001
01:48:28,276 --> 01:48:32,239
- You must be joking.
- We shall see if I am joking.

1002
01:48:32,280 --> 01:48:35,958
- The devil's got in you.
- I'm not joining any ridiculous...

1003
01:48:36,038 --> 01:48:38,540
But we'll get him out.

1004
01:48:38,578 --> 01:48:41,602
I can see we have
a lot of work ahead of us.

1005
01:48:46,721 --> 01:48:50,090
I had hoped you would bring troops,
Aetius.

1006
01:48:50,131 --> 01:48:52,634
Ever since Attila crushed our army,

1007
01:48:52,671 --> 01:48:55,482
we huddle, trembling,
behind our walls.

1008
01:48:55,524 --> 01:48:57,955
We have no troops to spare, Majesty.

1009
01:48:57,996 --> 01:49:01,816
- And money?
- Alas, we're short there, too.

1010
01:49:01,858 --> 01:49:04,775
Then why did you bother to come?

1011
01:49:06,312 --> 01:49:08,424
To devise a plan, sire.

1012
01:49:09,515 --> 01:49:12,705
But it will take time.

1013
01:49:13,898 --> 01:49:16,295
We don't have time.

1014
01:49:16,335 --> 01:49:20,820
The nobles sell their very furniture
to meet Attila's demands,

1015
01:49:20,859 --> 01:49:23,325
while refugees flood the city.

1016
01:49:23,364 --> 01:49:26,626
The rich give them work
to prevent riots.

1017
01:49:26,671 --> 01:49:29,554
As you can see, I do my share.

1018
01:49:33,526 --> 01:49:38,390
You spoke of a plan.
What do you mean exactly?

1019
01:49:39,477 --> 01:49:42,572
An empire built so quickly
will have weaknesses.

1020
01:49:42,608 --> 01:49:45,492
How will you discover them?

1021
01:49:45,531 --> 01:49:48,448
I'll visit Attila's territory.

1022
01:49:48,490 --> 01:49:52,833
Rather vague.
I have something more specific.

1023
01:49:52,875 --> 01:49:54,927
Assassination.

1024
01:49:58,304 --> 01:50:00,380
Forgive me, Aetius.

1025
01:50:00,427 --> 01:50:03,343
I wanted you to see
his work first-hand.

1026
01:50:05,402 --> 01:50:07,798
This is Lygus,

1027
01:50:07,837 --> 01:50:10,471
adept at seeing without being seen,

1028
01:50:10,518 --> 01:50:13,152
skilful with weapons,

1029
01:50:13,198 --> 01:50:14,822
as you can see.

1030
01:50:14,903 --> 01:50:18,273
And best of all, he has no tongue.

1031
01:50:18,314 --> 01:50:21,683
So if he's caught,
he can't give me away.

1032
01:50:24,158 --> 01:50:26,412
Attila has spies as we do.

1033
01:50:27,501 --> 01:50:30,347
He'll hear of your plan and foil it.

1034
01:50:30,388 --> 01:50:33,721
Perhaps, perhaps not.

1035
01:50:38,113 --> 01:50:41,139
- You like the girl?
- A refugee?

1036
01:50:41,177 --> 01:50:45,245
Her family was slaughtered by
the Huns. Shall I send her to you?

1037
01:50:45,282 --> 01:50:48,615
Yes, if I may request
one alteration.

1038
01:50:48,658 --> 01:50:52,027
Please yourself. She is yours.

1039
01:51:03,239 --> 01:51:04,791
Your name?

1040
01:51:04,839 --> 01:51:07,021
Ilidico.

1041
01:51:09,432 --> 01:51:12,979
They tell me you have reason
to hate the Huns.

1042
01:51:13,018 --> 01:51:16,244
My father was village chieftain.

1043
01:51:16,289 --> 01:51:19,065
I saw him die, my mother as well.

1044
01:51:19,107 --> 01:51:20,767
Bones left...

1045
01:51:20,812 --> 01:51:23,481
for the vultures.

1046
01:51:23,527 --> 01:51:27,312
- But you managed to escape.
- To my sorrow.

1047
01:51:27,355 --> 01:51:30,653
Suppose I could arrange for you
to take revenge?

1048
01:51:30,695 --> 01:51:33,577
- How?
- By killing their king.

1049
01:51:35,358 --> 01:51:37,861
Attila himself? How is it possible?

1050
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:41,233
My question first.
If it were possible, would you do it?

1051
01:51:41,275 --> 01:51:45,901
- Yes, I would do it.
- Even if it meant your own death?

1052
01:51:47,364 --> 01:51:52,014
I would enter hell rejoicing if
I could send Attila there before me.

1053
01:51:57,039 --> 01:52:00,300
We will assemble
in the courtyard in one hour.

1054
01:52:00,345 --> 01:52:04,794
Today we minister to the poor
in St Catherine's parish.

1055
01:52:14,473 --> 01:52:18,577
You hate this place as much as I do.
I can see it in your eyes.

1056
01:52:18,613 --> 01:52:21,876
What if I do?
I'm trapped here just as you are.

1057
01:52:21,921 --> 01:52:23,688
You're wrong.

1058
01:52:23,766 --> 01:52:26,161
Do you have friends on the outside?

1059
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:30,234
I've written a note.
Have it delivered with this ring.

1060
01:52:32,116 --> 01:52:35,700
Take it and the ring
to prove the letter comes from me.

1061
01:52:36,362 --> 01:52:39,483
Have your friend deliver these
to the man I name

1062
01:52:39,530 --> 01:52:41,712
and you and I will be free forever.

1063
01:52:41,756 --> 01:52:46,928
- What man?
- Attila, King of the Huns.

1064
01:52:52,057 --> 01:52:55,498
We conquer cities, we rule the world,

1065
01:52:55,537 --> 01:52:58,763
and yet, we can't even build a bath.

1066
01:52:58,808 --> 01:53:01,168
There's a more pressing matter.

1067
01:53:01,208 --> 01:53:03,985
The Eastern emperor
has hired an assassin.

1068
01:53:04,029 --> 01:53:06,530
- I want a bath like in Rome.
- Majesty...

1069
01:53:06,568 --> 01:53:09,937
Our spies bring this rumor
every week.

1070
01:53:09,978 --> 01:53:11,888
This rumor has substance.

1071
01:53:11,927 --> 01:53:15,023
- There are so many foreigners.
- Including you.

1072
01:53:15,059 --> 01:53:17,135
Or have you forgotten?

1073
01:53:17,181 --> 01:53:19,779
I trust I've proved my loyalty, sire.

1074
01:53:19,826 --> 01:53:21,903
So you have.

1075
01:53:21,950 --> 01:53:24,026
Many times.

1076
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:32,768
Orestes, if it is my destiny to die,
I will die.

1077
01:53:32,807 --> 01:53:38,300
- If not, no assassin can harm me.
- Still, I ask you to be prudent.

1078
01:53:38,340 --> 01:53:41,257
And I ask you,
why is this bath not finished?

1079
01:53:41,298 --> 01:53:44,144
The marble has to be brought
a thousand leagues,

1080
01:53:44,186 --> 01:53:46,334
the pipes angled and the furnace...

1081
01:53:46,379 --> 01:53:48,323
Enough.

1082
01:53:48,362 --> 01:53:52,324
- You have three days.
- Three days? But sire.

1083
01:53:52,363 --> 01:53:55,281
Yes, Great King, of course,
three days.

1084
01:54:06,910 --> 01:54:10,135
- That's Attila?
- Yes.

1085
01:54:11,503 --> 01:54:15,467
Try to keep the hatred
out of your eyes when you meet him.

1086
01:54:48,287 --> 01:54:50,362
Your name is Lygus.

1087
01:54:50,409 --> 01:54:54,014
You were sent by Theodosius,
Emperor of the East.

1088
01:54:54,098 --> 01:54:56,352
Is that not so?

1089
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:26,910
Orestes!

1090
01:55:29,976 --> 01:55:32,931
You were supposed to call
when he showed himself.

1091
01:55:32,969 --> 01:55:36,574
- There was no need.
- I'll have him crucified.

1092
01:55:36,623 --> 01:55:40,966
He's a brave man
and loyal to his master.

1093
01:55:42,053 --> 01:55:44,484
- Send him back safely.
- Sire...

1094
01:55:45,567 --> 01:55:48,972
- How much was he to be paid?
- 50lbs in gold.

1095
01:55:49,012 --> 01:55:52,830
Place the sum in a sack,
hang it from his neck,

1096
01:55:52,874 --> 01:55:55,162
and let him return wearing it.

1097
01:55:59,243 --> 01:56:01,319
The emperor will be humiliated.

1098
01:56:01,365 --> 01:56:05,921
The blame lies with him
for giving the order, not this man.

1099
01:56:05,960 --> 01:56:10,823
There may be other attempts, sire.
Rome has spies throughout the city.

1100
01:56:12,605 --> 01:56:15,381
It's not my fate to be assassinated.

1101
01:56:15,425 --> 01:56:20,111
There are slaves, merchants, even
mercenaries who sell information.

1102
01:56:20,156 --> 01:56:25,199
Today a peddler asked my servant
your pretext for invading the West.

1103
01:56:29,797 --> 01:56:34,103
I'll find work near the bath,
sell myself as a slave if I have to.

1104
01:56:34,146 --> 01:56:36,471
Sooner or later, he'll notice me.

1105
01:56:37,417 --> 01:56:39,495
He will not be what you expect.

1106
01:56:41,281 --> 01:56:45,385
The other woman's village
was destroyed the same as yours.

1107
01:56:45,422 --> 01:56:49,385
She too began by hating him,
but her hatred turned to love.

1108
01:56:49,424 --> 01:56:52,056
Then she was weak.

1109
01:57:14,375 --> 01:57:16,877
Is this the man you spoke of?

1110
01:57:16,914 --> 01:57:18,990
- Yes.
- Take him.

1111
01:57:30,556 --> 01:57:33,094
Kneel before the King of the Huns.

1112
01:57:35,184 --> 01:57:37,261
Leave us.

1113
01:57:41,309 --> 01:57:45,864
About an hour ago, a plot to kill me
failed. Were you part of it?

1114
01:57:45,903 --> 01:57:47,955
If I were, you'd be dead.

1115
01:57:50,323 --> 01:57:55,008
Yet you come disguised as a peasant.
Why not openly, as a friend?

1116
01:57:55,055 --> 01:57:59,018
To see what I wish to see,
not what you wish to show me.

1117
01:57:59,057 --> 01:58:00,088
And?

1118
01:58:01,841 --> 01:58:03,893
You've done well.

1119
01:58:07,201 --> 01:58:12,550
The lands I rule are as vast
as both your empires put together.

1120
01:58:15,169 --> 01:58:19,689
There's more to empires than land.
Where are the Forums?

1121
01:58:19,728 --> 01:58:21,946
The Colosseums? The great Circus?

1122
01:58:21,990 --> 01:58:24,279
Theatres? Aqueducts?

1123
01:58:24,323 --> 01:58:26,576
Give us time, Aetius.

1124
01:58:26,619 --> 01:58:30,094
It took Rome centuries
to become what it is.

1125
01:58:32,256 --> 01:58:36,384
And what happens to us
while you're learning?

1126
01:58:36,431 --> 01:58:40,702
- Do we sink into chaos and ruin?
- Only if you resist us.

1127
01:58:44,331 --> 01:58:47,843
Civilized men are easy to conquer,

1128
01:58:47,881 --> 01:58:49,958
but civilization...

1129
01:58:50,770 --> 01:58:53,794
still belongs to the civilized,
not the barbarians.

1130
01:58:53,832 --> 01:58:57,165
It belongs to whoever
is strong enough to take it.

1131
01:59:01,002 --> 01:59:03,291
Aetius, join me.

1132
01:59:05,004 --> 01:59:07,885
Once, you invited me to Rome.

1133
01:59:07,926 --> 01:59:10,915
You said we could
do great things together.

1134
01:59:10,953 --> 01:59:12,863
We still can.

1135
01:59:12,902 --> 01:59:15,498
Only now I invite you to stay here.

1136
01:59:15,545 --> 01:59:17,621
To serve you?

1137
01:59:17,669 --> 01:59:21,252
I'm a better man
than the emperors you serve now.

1138
01:59:22,366 --> 01:59:24,512
I serve Rome.

1139
01:59:38,405 --> 01:59:42,474
Speak frankly. Do you plan
to attack the Western Empire?

1140
01:59:42,511 --> 01:59:44,837
I have no such plans at the moment.

1141
01:59:45,748 --> 01:59:47,586
But in the future?

1142
01:59:47,626 --> 01:59:50,331
No one can tell the future.

1143
01:59:50,375 --> 01:59:53,435
Let's strike a bargain here and now.

1144
01:59:53,472 --> 01:59:58,062
A treaty of peace
between your people and mine.

1145
01:59:58,099 --> 02:00:01,990
I think that's the first sign
of weakness I've ever seen you show.

1146
02:00:07,111 --> 02:00:08,913
Will you make the treaty?

1147
02:00:10,730 --> 02:00:16,221
Empires expand until someone
is strong enough to stop them.

1148
02:00:16,261 --> 02:00:20,152
So it was with Rome, so with us.

1149
02:00:20,194 --> 02:00:23,384
And so it will be
as long as men walk the earth.

1150
02:00:23,429 --> 02:00:25,861
Then our business here is done.

1151
02:00:27,745 --> 02:00:29,618
So it seems.

1152
02:01:21,223 --> 02:01:23,168
Well done, Orestes.

1153
02:01:23,207 --> 02:01:27,763
I will use it tonight.
Bring my wives.

1154
02:01:27,799 --> 02:01:30,469
Which ones, Your Majesty?

1155
02:01:31,766 --> 02:01:33,462
All of them.

1156
02:01:33,506 --> 02:01:36,079
It's the only way to avoid a fight.

1157
02:01:37,332 --> 02:01:39,277
Yes, Your Majesty.

1158
02:01:51,528 --> 02:01:53,189
Majesty?

1159
02:01:54,417 --> 02:01:57,085
That girl, who is she?

1160
02:01:57,861 --> 02:02:01,159
- A slave.
- How long has she been here?

1161
02:02:01,202 --> 02:02:02,933
Where is she from?

1162
02:02:02,976 --> 02:02:05,680
Newly arrived.
I don't know where she's from.

1163
02:02:05,724 --> 02:02:08,228
- I can find out.
- Yes.

1164
02:02:09,344 --> 02:02:14,065
Find out everything about her,
and bring her to me tonight.

1165
02:02:14,111 --> 02:02:16,780
But your wives, Majesty,
and the bath.

1166
02:02:16,825 --> 02:02:19,077
Tell them it's not finished.

1167
02:02:19,120 --> 02:02:23,534
Spare their feelings,
but tell them... whatever you wish.

1168
02:02:40,067 --> 02:02:41,798
Come closer.

1169
02:02:52,176 --> 02:02:54,429
Don't be afraid.

1170
02:02:58,542 --> 02:03:00,617
I won't hurt you.

1171
02:03:16,531 --> 02:03:18,440
What are you frightened of?

1172
02:03:18,479 --> 02:03:23,556
Among my people,
a woman who is taken before marriage

1173
02:03:23,594 --> 02:03:25,396
is dishonored forever.

1174
02:03:25,438 --> 02:03:27,455
You won't be dishonored.

1175
02:03:27,491 --> 02:03:30,645
Why else do kings
bring slaves to their quarters?

1176
02:03:30,692 --> 02:03:33,848
You won't be dishonored. I swear it.

1177
02:03:38,799 --> 02:03:40,874
Your name is Ilidico,

1178
02:03:41,826 --> 02:03:43,901
from a village to the north?

1179
02:03:43,949 --> 02:03:48,054
- My village was destroyed.
- And your family?

1180
02:03:48,090 --> 02:03:51,150
- Killed.
- I'm sorry.

1181
02:03:52,579 --> 02:03:54,939
Those things happen in war.

1182
02:03:56,719 --> 02:04:01,724
But whatever can be done
for your comfort will be done.

1183
02:04:01,763 --> 02:04:03,637
Why?

1184
02:04:05,383 --> 02:04:08,608
- You please me.
- You don't even know me.

1185
02:04:10,985 --> 02:04:13,310
But I will come to know you...

1186
02:04:15,228 --> 02:04:17,376
and you will come to know me.

1187
02:04:20,101 --> 02:04:22,176
As you wish, Great King.

1188
02:04:24,380 --> 02:04:29,551
When my village was destroyed,
I stayed in the forest for days.

1189
02:04:29,599 --> 02:04:31,676
Finally, I came to a road,

1190
02:04:31,722 --> 02:04:35,019
and the next day,
some travelers took me in.

1191
02:04:35,062 --> 02:04:37,350
I will have them rewarded.

1192
02:04:37,393 --> 02:04:41,734
They were killed by robbers,
but I was lucky again and escaped.

1193
02:04:43,621 --> 02:04:46,647
It wasn't luck
that brought you here.

1194
02:04:48,145 --> 02:04:51,549
The gods work in mysterious ways.

1195
02:04:51,590 --> 02:04:56,418
They take with one hand
and give back with the other.

1196
02:04:57,469 --> 02:04:59,545
I don't understand.

1197
02:05:02,305 --> 02:05:05,945
- Are you still frightened of me?
- Great King, I...

1198
02:05:05,993 --> 02:05:08,105
Call me by my name.

1199
02:05:09,473 --> 02:05:13,886
- Is it permitted?
- I command it.

1200
02:05:15,006 --> 02:05:19,110
Then, no,
I'm not still frightened of you...

1201
02:05:20,121 --> 02:05:21,993
Attila.

1202
02:05:32,264 --> 02:05:36,118
News from Pannonia.
Attila is getting married again.

1203
02:05:36,160 --> 02:05:37,749
- Is he?
- Yes.

1204
02:05:37,796 --> 02:05:41,093
To some slave girl
who suddenly took his fancy.

1205
02:05:41,137 --> 02:05:45,206
I suppose, in addition to the fortune
he already extracts from me,

1206
02:05:45,242 --> 02:05:48,396
I shall be expected
to send a royal wedding present.

1207
02:05:48,443 --> 02:05:51,396
That's what you get
for trying to kill him.

1208
02:05:51,436 --> 02:05:55,113
Why don't you stop being so smug
and form a plan of your own?

1209
02:05:55,158 --> 02:05:58,705
- That's what you're here for.
- I did form a plan.

1210
02:05:58,743 --> 02:06:02,287
And I have every reason to
believe that Attila's marriage

1211
02:06:02,326 --> 02:06:05,551
may not turn out
to be an entirely happy one.

1212
02:06:15,931 --> 02:06:20,449
Gods of my father, curse this root,
and make it deadly.

1213
02:06:20,489 --> 02:06:23,192
And curse he who drinks it.

1214
02:06:24,211 --> 02:06:29,491
And give me the strength to hate
till my father's death is avenged.

1215
02:06:37,746 --> 02:06:40,178
Your Majesty, Lord Orestes.

1216
02:06:40,217 --> 02:06:43,442
- What is it?
- A message from Constantinople.

1217
02:06:43,488 --> 02:06:45,670
- From the emperor?
- No, my lord,

1218
02:06:45,714 --> 02:06:49,354
- a Roman princess named Honoria.
- This is her ring.

1219
02:06:49,402 --> 02:06:51,454
She wore it often.

1220
02:06:53,299 --> 02:06:54,829
Read it.

1221
02:06:54,866 --> 02:06:59,493
She says she's being held prisoner
on her brother's orders.

1222
02:06:59,529 --> 02:07:02,339
If you rescue her, she'll marry you.

1223
02:07:05,268 --> 02:07:08,079
I have no need of another wife.

1224
02:07:08,122 --> 02:07:12,155
She promises, as her dowry,
one half of the Western Empire.

1225
02:07:13,655 --> 02:07:15,351
There is my pretext.

1226
02:07:15,394 --> 02:07:17,754
She has no right to half the empire.

1227
02:07:17,794 --> 02:07:20,535
Perhaps you should consult a lawyer.

1228
02:07:20,579 --> 02:07:23,460
Attila is already
gathering his forces.

1229
02:07:23,500 --> 02:07:25,788
The wedding to the slave girl?

1230
02:07:25,832 --> 02:07:27,635
Postponed indefinitely.

1231
02:07:27,676 --> 02:07:31,186
All nations north of the Rhine
are to join the Huns

1232
02:07:31,225 --> 02:07:35,294
in a mighty crusade against
the wicked forces of the West.

1233
02:07:35,331 --> 02:07:38,036
Then we must present a united front.

1234
02:07:38,080 --> 02:07:41,235
Attila has hammered us long enough.

1235
02:07:41,282 --> 02:07:44,162
It's your turn now, Flavius Aetius.

1236
02:07:44,204 --> 02:07:47,953
I'm sending Honoria
back to Rome on the next ship,

1237
02:07:47,997 --> 02:07:50,879
and I wish you the best of luck.

1238
02:07:52,345 --> 02:07:56,236
He marches on Rome within the month.

1239
02:08:06,854 --> 02:08:10,495
I've neglected you
for the past few days.

1240
02:08:10,543 --> 02:08:13,212
I apologize.
There was much to be done.

1241
02:08:13,257 --> 02:08:18,014
They tell me you're going to war
to rescue a Roman princess.

1242
02:08:19,277 --> 02:08:21,814
I will probably never even meet her.

1243
02:08:21,851 --> 02:08:24,661
But it's given me
a reason to invade Rome.

1244
02:08:24,704 --> 02:08:26,921
And our wedding?

1245
02:08:27,939 --> 02:08:30,963
It will have to be postponed
until I return.

1246
02:08:31,698 --> 02:08:33,774
Several months at least.

1247
02:08:36,534 --> 02:08:39,167
And if I am not here
when you return?

1248
02:08:43,320 --> 02:08:47,139
I will tell my servants
you are free to leave at any time.

1249
02:08:48,365 --> 02:08:49,788
Wait.

1250
02:08:50,869 --> 02:08:54,475
I've displeased you.
We could marry before you leave.

1251
02:08:54,524 --> 02:08:58,651
My weddings are state affairs,
for royalty from many nations.

1252
02:08:58,698 --> 02:09:00,774
There is no time.

1253
02:09:03,640 --> 02:09:05,892
I thought I was the one in a hurry.

1254
02:09:09,032 --> 02:09:11,083
Perhaps I've changed.

1255
02:09:16,618 --> 02:09:18,669
I'm glad.

1256
02:09:19,749 --> 02:09:21,658
May I speak freely?

1257
02:09:22,742 --> 02:09:24,817
You may.

1258
02:09:26,080 --> 02:09:29,485
I've been told of another woman,
named N'Kara.

1259
02:09:31,719 --> 02:09:33,794
My first wife.

1260
02:09:33,841 --> 02:09:35,952
She died giving birth.

1261
02:09:38,225 --> 02:09:40,513
They say I'm of her very likeness.

1262
02:09:40,556 --> 02:09:43,675
You resemble her closely, yes.

1263
02:09:43,721 --> 02:09:46,048
Then who is it you marry?

1264
02:09:46,088 --> 02:09:48,792
Me or N'Kara?

1265
02:09:52,734 --> 02:09:55,403
If I had wanted nothing
but her likeness,

1266
02:09:55,448 --> 02:09:57,523
I would have taken you by now.

1267
02:09:57,569 --> 02:09:59,515
But I haven't, have I?

1268
02:10:00,598 --> 02:10:02,056
No.

1269
02:10:05,434 --> 02:10:09,502
Then wait until I return,
and you, not N'Kara,

1270
02:10:09,539 --> 02:10:11,721
will be queen of the world.

1271
02:12:07,213 --> 02:12:08,944
Battering ram!

1272
02:13:02,398 --> 02:13:08,272
He's taken 30 cities in Gaul. Some
surrendered, some were destroyed.

1273
02:13:08,313 --> 02:13:12,131
- While we did nothing.
- They weren't necessary to us.

1274
02:13:12,174 --> 02:13:15,614
- Nevertheless, they were Roman.
- I understand your distress,

1275
02:13:15,653 --> 02:13:21,847
but in a crisis, that which is
unnecessary must be dispensed with.

1276
02:13:22,892 --> 02:13:27,719
Attila's carving a path wide enough
to protect him, but no further.

1277
02:13:27,762 --> 02:13:31,402
Clearly, he intends
to press on further west.

1278
02:13:31,450 --> 02:13:34,332
If he wants to conquer Rome,

1279
02:13:34,373 --> 02:13:37,220
why doesn't he
march south into Italy?

1280
02:13:37,261 --> 02:13:40,771
Then the free tribes of Gaul
might threaten his rear.

1281
02:13:40,811 --> 02:13:43,408
So he plans to conquer Gaul first?

1282
02:13:43,454 --> 02:13:45,530
As I would in his place.

1283
02:13:45,577 --> 02:13:47,652
Then where do we stop him?

1284
02:13:52,327 --> 02:13:57,047
Here, at Orleans.
He cannot afford to bypass the city.

1285
02:13:57,093 --> 02:13:59,240
He must be near there already.

1286
02:13:59,286 --> 02:14:02,892
- The siege began two days ago.
- We should send troops.

1287
02:14:02,940 --> 02:14:05,573
I sent them some time ago.

1288
02:14:05,620 --> 02:14:09,890
- The city can hold for months.
- And then?

1289
02:14:10,942 --> 02:14:13,267
500 leagues from his base,

1290
02:14:13,308 --> 02:14:16,676
with winter coming on,
he'll have to withdraw.

1291
02:14:16,717 --> 02:14:20,123
- He'll be back next year.
- By which time, other plans of mine

1292
02:14:20,163 --> 02:14:22,036
will have taken effect.

1293
02:14:22,076 --> 02:14:28,399
Flavius Aetius, once again,
you have done Rome a great service.

1294
02:14:33,593 --> 02:14:35,538
What if Orleans falls?

1295
02:14:35,577 --> 02:14:37,759
I'm confident that it won't.

1296
02:14:37,803 --> 02:14:40,305
You should have a contingency plan,

1297
02:14:40,343 --> 02:14:43,368
and it should be
an alliance with the Visigoths.

1298
02:14:43,405 --> 02:14:47,569
- Theodoric wouldn't consider it.
- He might, at the right price.

1299
02:14:47,616 --> 02:14:50,214
She's his daughter, Aetius.

1300
02:14:50,260 --> 02:14:52,796
Can't blame him for wanting her back.

1301
02:14:52,834 --> 02:14:55,016
She's my child in every way.

1302
02:14:55,060 --> 02:14:57,041
Except by blood.

1303
02:14:57,079 --> 02:15:00,104
The fact of which
she is completely ignorant.

1304
02:15:00,142 --> 02:15:04,104
Whoever enlightens her dies.

1305
02:15:04,143 --> 02:15:06,645
I wouldn't meddle in family affairs,

1306
02:15:06,682 --> 02:15:11,024
but you always talk about
making sacrifices for the empire.

1307
02:15:11,067 --> 02:15:16,072
That sacrifice is not necessary,
because we don't need Theodoric.

1308
02:15:16,112 --> 02:15:19,658
Attila will be stopped at Orleans.

1309
02:15:23,731 --> 02:15:27,065
Get those ladders back up - now!

1310
02:15:45,235 --> 02:15:47,252
Move in there!

1311
02:15:48,436 --> 02:15:50,831
Bring the battering ram!

1312
02:16:57,433 --> 02:17:02,296
Train all the catapults at this
point, to the right of the gate.

1313
02:17:03,417 --> 02:17:05,492
It is done.

1314
02:17:13,438 --> 02:17:15,026
Clear!

1315
02:17:15,073 --> 02:17:16,496
Pull!

1316
02:17:30,070 --> 02:17:33,996
Your Majesty.
Everything is in position.

1317
02:17:39,116 --> 02:17:40,775
Pull!

1318
02:17:41,865 --> 02:17:43,324
Pull.

1319
02:17:50,528 --> 02:17:51,597
Clear!

1320
02:17:51,643 --> 02:17:53,623
Pull.

1321
02:17:55,087 --> 02:17:56,710
Pull!

1322
02:17:58,531 --> 02:17:59,918
Pull!

1323
02:18:01,732 --> 02:18:03,047
Pull!

1324
02:18:11,928 --> 02:18:13,316
Pull!

1325
02:18:18,294 --> 02:18:19,682
Pull!

1326
02:18:26,018 --> 02:18:27,406
Pull!

1327
02:18:53,054 --> 02:18:55,342
- You are certain?
- Yes, my lord.

1328
02:18:55,386 --> 02:18:58,683
- I saw it with my own eyes.
- The troops?

1329
02:18:58,725 --> 02:19:02,828
- Those who survived were executed.
- The population?

1330
02:19:02,865 --> 02:19:06,448
Enslaved, and every building
burned to the ground.

1331
02:19:08,085 --> 02:19:09,958
Leave me.

1332
02:19:29,171 --> 02:19:31,317
I think he loves me, Father,

1333
02:19:31,362 --> 02:19:33,901
even if he hasn't said so yet.

1334
02:19:33,938 --> 02:19:35,396
Who?

1335
02:19:35,435 --> 02:19:38,458
Livius. Who else?

1336
02:19:38,495 --> 02:19:41,449
Oh, yes, of course.

1337
02:19:42,531 --> 02:19:44,606
What's wrong?

1338
02:19:46,185 --> 02:19:50,112
- Attila's taken Orleans.
- You said that wouldn't happen.

1339
02:19:50,152 --> 02:19:52,227
It seems I was mistaken.

1340
02:19:53,596 --> 02:19:55,708
What will you do?

1341
02:19:55,754 --> 02:19:58,113
Take a journey to Gaul.

1342
02:20:01,041 --> 02:20:03,367
I'd like you to come.

1343
02:20:03,408 --> 02:20:06,218
Now? Just when Livius is...

1344
02:20:08,522 --> 02:20:10,811
If you think you'll need me.

1345
02:20:12,523 --> 02:20:16,237
- I think I might.
- I'll make ready.

1346
02:20:28,459 --> 02:20:30,821
Mmm...

1347
02:20:46,345 --> 02:20:48,183
What's she doing here?

1348
02:20:48,224 --> 02:20:50,441
Take her back to prison at once.

1349
02:20:50,484 --> 02:20:54,482
- Valentinian, she's your sister.
- Well, tell her that.

1350
02:20:54,521 --> 02:20:58,483
She plots against me,
then offers my empire to barbarians.

1351
02:20:58,522 --> 02:21:01,368
She's come to beg your forgiveness.

1352
02:21:01,411 --> 02:21:03,486
Haven't you, Honoria?

1353
02:21:06,734 --> 02:21:09,438
As your sister and loyal subject,

1354
02:21:09,482 --> 02:21:11,700
I humbly beg your forgiveness.

1355
02:21:12,545 --> 02:21:14,419
I'm touched!

1356
02:21:14,459 --> 02:21:16,641
- I told you!
- Honoria, please.

1357
02:21:16,686 --> 02:21:19,046
You can't keep her locked up forever.

1358
02:21:19,086 --> 02:21:20,923
Can't I? We'll see.

1359
02:21:20,964 --> 02:21:24,748
- Guards, take her back to her cell!
- Valentinian...

1360
02:21:24,791 --> 02:21:26,867
Mother!

1361
02:21:28,202 --> 02:21:29,862
Tell me, Mother.

1362
02:21:29,907 --> 02:21:34,841
How can you be so concerned for one
child and so unfeeling to the other?

1363
02:21:34,882 --> 02:21:38,631
- What are you talking about?
- Let's stop pretending.

1364
02:21:38,675 --> 02:21:42,529
Your attempt to have me killed
in the Garden of Corona.

1365
02:21:42,571 --> 02:21:46,355
You thought I didn't know.
I've known since it happened.

1366
02:21:46,399 --> 02:21:50,111
- You're mad.
- If not for Aetius, I'd have died.

1367
02:21:50,156 --> 02:21:52,861
- The assassin carried your seal.
- Impossible.

1368
02:21:52,905 --> 02:21:54,815
I saw it myself.

1369
02:21:54,855 --> 02:22:00,655
Since you became emperor I've only
given my seal to one person.

1370
02:22:00,699 --> 02:22:02,252
Aetius.

1371
02:22:10,338 --> 02:22:14,680
He's three days' march
from here and moving quickly.

1372
02:22:14,722 --> 02:22:18,019
I'll withdraw
into the mountains,

1373
02:22:18,061 --> 02:22:21,844
or perhaps I'll join his army,
leaving you to stand alone.

1374
02:22:21,889 --> 02:22:24,107
Then you would be his servant.

1375
02:22:24,151 --> 02:22:26,404
I would also see Rome crushed.

1376
02:22:26,447 --> 02:22:29,401
I think I would enjoy that very much.

1377
02:22:31,075 --> 02:22:35,002
You and I have fought over land,
but we've also shared it.

1378
02:22:35,041 --> 02:22:38,624
We fought over religion,
but we're both Christian.

1379
02:22:38,660 --> 02:22:41,613
This isn't just
you and me against Attila.

1380
02:22:41,653 --> 02:22:44,322
It's our world against his world.

1381
02:22:48,472 --> 02:22:50,654
Name your terms.

1382
02:22:51,743 --> 02:22:54,031
My men to fight under my banner.

1383
02:22:55,605 --> 02:22:57,622
You and I to command jointly.

1384
02:23:01,033 --> 02:23:03,393
You will return my daughter to me.

1385
02:23:08,305 --> 02:23:11,983
- Ask for something else.
- I want my daughter.

1386
02:23:12,028 --> 02:23:16,334
She doesn't know she's your daughter.
She's lived as a Roman.

1387
02:23:16,377 --> 02:23:20,268
Without me as an ally,
there will be no Rome.

1388
02:23:26,503 --> 02:23:28,127
Hello, Father.

1389
02:23:31,511 --> 02:23:33,243
Who's this?

1390
02:23:36,802 --> 02:23:38,948
Father? Father?

1391
02:23:40,595 --> 02:23:42,053
Father!

1392
02:23:42,299 --> 02:23:44,136
Father...!

1393
02:23:45,603 --> 02:23:51,298
She'll be taken over the mountains
to Spain. You'll never see her again.

1394
02:23:55,556 --> 02:23:59,719
And now you know what it is
to have your child stolen from you.

1395
02:24:03,976 --> 02:24:06,027
Gather your army.

1396
02:24:07,107 --> 02:24:12,350
- We must withdraw at first light.
- And leave my villages unprotected?

1397
02:24:13,543 --> 02:24:15,690
Burn the villages.

1398
02:24:15,736 --> 02:24:18,690
Burn the crops.
Burn anything that doesn't travel.

1399
02:24:18,729 --> 02:24:24,398
Attila commands many nations,
but his best troops are still Huns.

1400
02:24:24,434 --> 02:24:26,651
If we take away his horses...

1401
02:24:27,740 --> 02:24:29,815
we can win.

1402
02:24:36,612 --> 02:24:38,688
Galen...

1403
02:24:39,744 --> 02:24:42,590
I used to make fun of your visions,

1404
02:24:45,206 --> 02:24:47,282
but I wish you were here now.

1405
02:24:56,098 --> 02:24:58,173
God of war,

1406
02:25:00,029 --> 02:25:05,307
you once gave me this sword
as a token of your favor.

1407
02:25:07,858 --> 02:25:13,029
When I've been in need,
you've guided me by sending a sign.

1408
02:25:21,986 --> 02:25:24,417
If I am still your chosen one,

1409
02:25:25,498 --> 02:25:28,239
if it is my destiny
to rule the world,

1410
02:25:31,136 --> 02:25:33,531
send me a sign now.

1411
02:25:40,564 --> 02:25:42,639
Send me a sign!

1412
02:25:56,499 --> 02:25:59,490
Your Majesty,
we were concerned about you.

1413
02:25:59,528 --> 02:26:03,168
- What's happened?
- Aetius has stopped retreating.

1414
02:26:03,216 --> 02:26:07,663
He takes position ten leagues away,
by a village called Shalom.

1415
02:26:10,591 --> 02:26:14,934
I thought the war gods refused me
a sign, but I was wrong.

1416
02:26:16,090 --> 02:26:19,530
What better sign than
an enemy prepared to fight?

1417
02:26:46,499 --> 02:26:51,126
Visigoths, the land
we fight on belongs to you.

1418
02:26:52,970 --> 02:26:55,545
Fight well, or it belongs to Attila.

1419
02:26:56,591 --> 02:26:59,686
Your wives and daughters
will be his slaves.

1420
02:27:03,063 --> 02:27:06,845
Romans, you too
fight for your country.

1421
02:27:06,888 --> 02:27:09,593
For if we fail,
Attila will march on Rome,

1422
02:27:09,638 --> 02:27:11,927
and there's no one to oppose him.

1423
02:27:11,970 --> 02:27:14,507
Remember your ancestors.

1424
02:27:15,588 --> 02:27:17,842
Add their strength to yours,

1425
02:27:18,928 --> 02:27:22,568
or a flame that has lit the lives
of men for a thousand years

1426
02:27:22,616 --> 02:27:25,642
will perish from the earth!

1427
02:27:25,679 --> 02:27:30,054
They retreat,
burn their own fields,

1428
02:27:30,097 --> 02:27:32,979
choose their ground with care.

1429
02:27:33,019 --> 02:27:36,767
They use tricks
because they are weak!

1430
02:27:37,926 --> 02:27:41,224
We are strong and so they fear us.

1431
02:27:42,414 --> 02:27:46,091
Huns, it's enough to remind you

1432
02:27:46,137 --> 02:27:50,063
that we've fought many battles
and never been defeated.

1433
02:27:51,042 --> 02:27:55,456
To you nations and tribes
who fight alongside us,

1434
02:27:55,497 --> 02:27:58,758
I say you are Huns in spirit!

1435
02:27:59,637 --> 02:28:01,476
You are invincible.

1436
02:28:34,883 --> 02:28:38,075
There is no retreat
from this place, Valorus.

1437
02:28:38,120 --> 02:28:40,657
We must hold this hill at all costs.

1438
02:28:40,695 --> 02:28:44,728
All is set, my lord.
They'll never make it up the hill.

1439
02:28:59,831 --> 02:29:02,191
It's marshland and they've dug pits.

1440
02:29:02,232 --> 02:29:04,177
We'll proceed on foot.

1441
02:29:04,215 --> 02:29:06,433
Dismount!

1442
02:29:06,478 --> 02:29:09,501
Archers to the front! All-out attack!

1443
02:29:58,529 --> 02:30:00,782
Send a reserve unit to the line.

1444
02:30:00,825 --> 02:30:03,636
Second Cohort, forward!

1445
02:30:20,729 --> 02:30:22,317
Orestes!

1446
02:30:24,034 --> 02:30:28,138
- Orestes, fall back!
- Fall back! Fall back!

1447
02:30:36,246 --> 02:30:38,119
Fall back!

1448
02:30:56,322 --> 02:30:58,339
It's well entrenched, sir.

1449
02:30:58,376 --> 02:31:01,116
Keep half the company in reserve.

1450
02:31:01,159 --> 02:31:04,493
Send the other half
to aid against the Visigoths.

1451
02:31:05,648 --> 02:31:08,388
- On the flank?
- Yes.

1452
02:31:09,509 --> 02:31:13,673
Aetius will have to weaken
his position to reinforce them.

1453
02:31:13,755 --> 02:31:16,043
And when we does, we'll attack him.

1454
02:31:16,085 --> 02:31:18,161
Yes, sire.

1455
02:31:22,557 --> 02:31:23,244
Forward!

1456
02:31:30,908 --> 02:31:32,983
It is done, sire.

1457
02:31:51,089 --> 02:31:53,758
They're attacking the Visigoths.

1458
02:31:59,231 --> 02:32:01,663
Hold this hill!

1459
02:32:09,809 --> 02:32:13,971
Reinforcement! Flank attack!
More men now!

1460
02:32:16,036 --> 02:32:19,226
Let me have three cohorts
to lend support.

1461
02:32:21,707 --> 02:32:23,783
General, we'll be outflanked.

1462
02:32:23,830 --> 02:32:27,650
- It could be a diversion.
- It's an all-out attack.

1463
02:32:27,693 --> 02:32:29,638
Why isn't Attila leading it?

1464
02:32:32,946 --> 02:32:34,962
General, I beg you.

1465
02:32:38,688 --> 02:32:41,641
- Take them.
- Third Cohort with me.

1466
02:33:06,593 --> 02:33:09,654
It's working, sire.
They've weakened their center.

1467
02:33:09,689 --> 02:33:12,570
Bring up the reserves.

1468
02:33:12,612 --> 02:33:14,723
Reserves to the front!

1469
02:34:22,757 --> 02:34:24,630
We'll never hold.

1470
02:34:24,670 --> 02:34:27,066
Forgive me. I should have stayed.

1471
02:34:27,107 --> 02:34:30,712
- I commanded. The blame is mine.
- You can still escape.

1472
02:34:33,301 --> 02:34:35,174
No.

1473
02:34:36,466 --> 02:34:40,428
I gave the only thing I love
to save Rome.

1474
02:34:40,468 --> 02:34:42,543
Now I've lost Rome, too.

1475
02:34:44,294 --> 02:34:46,369
I'll die here.

1476
02:34:47,775 --> 02:34:50,135
But I give you one last order.

1477
02:34:50,175 --> 02:34:52,879
- Kill Theodoric.
- Yes, General.

1478
02:36:04,356 --> 02:36:06,538
All legions...

1479
02:36:08,149 --> 02:36:10,224
to the front.

1480
02:36:17,231 --> 02:36:19,305
The King is dead!

1481
02:36:26,102 --> 02:36:28,178
Charge!

1482
02:38:00,047 --> 02:38:02,407
Sire, we must retreat!

1483
02:38:03,491 --> 02:38:05,365
No.

1484
02:38:06,101 --> 02:38:08,604
We're pressed on all sides!

1485
02:38:16,053 --> 02:38:18,449
All to us, here, now!

1486
02:38:33,624 --> 02:38:37,337
Valorus, you were magnificent.

1487
02:38:37,383 --> 02:38:41,581
The Visigoths assumed
the arrow came from the Huns,

1488
02:38:41,626 --> 02:38:44,128
took revenge,
and won the day for us.

1489
02:38:44,166 --> 02:38:48,614
Never let it be said
that God is without humor.

1490
02:38:49,733 --> 02:38:52,403
God has more humor than you think.

1491
02:38:52,447 --> 02:38:54,701
The Visigoths are leaving camp.

1492
02:38:56,623 --> 02:38:59,920
Your father never would have left.

1493
02:38:59,964 --> 02:39:02,845
My father is dead
and I must look to my crown.

1494
02:39:02,885 --> 02:39:05,211
My brothers will start plotting.

1495
02:39:05,252 --> 02:39:09,451
- What difference can a day make?
- Enough, if spent fighting.

1496
02:39:09,497 --> 02:39:12,722
I'd lose good men,
needed against my brothers.

1497
02:39:12,767 --> 02:39:16,135
After the battle, I'll join you
against your brothers.

1498
02:39:17,848 --> 02:39:19,960
I won't owe my throne to a Roman.

1499
02:39:20,006 --> 02:39:23,409
I leave in the morning.
The decision is final.

1500
02:39:34,271 --> 02:39:37,532
The Romans have taken up
a defensive position.

1501
02:39:40,568 --> 02:39:43,069
- And the Visigoths?
- Gone.

1502
02:39:43,107 --> 02:39:47,343
Perhaps they mourn Theodoric or
they've quarreled with the Romans.

1503
02:39:47,388 --> 02:39:51,349
In any event, we face Aetius only.
He can't attack alone.

1504
02:39:52,085 --> 02:39:54,790
Nor are we strong enough
to attack him.

1505
02:39:54,834 --> 02:39:58,937
Then we can withdraw in good order
and return in the spring.

1506
02:40:00,018 --> 02:40:01,820
So it seems.

1507
02:40:01,862 --> 02:40:06,724
In that case, Your Majesty, may I
take the liberty of offering a gift?

1508
02:40:06,768 --> 02:40:08,713
A gift?

1509
02:40:08,751 --> 02:40:12,534
This morning I sent men to
the place where the sword broke.

1510
02:40:12,578 --> 02:40:15,354
They found these fragments.

1511
02:40:16,198 --> 02:40:20,195
There are smiths in Scythia who can
reforge this as strongly as ever,

1512
02:40:20,233 --> 02:40:22,308
if you will allow it.

1513
02:40:23,747 --> 02:40:26,522
- I will allow it.
- You see, Majesty,

1514
02:40:26,565 --> 02:40:30,599
your destiny has not ended,
it merely makes a new beginning.

1515
02:41:20,359 --> 02:41:23,998
Aetius, your wisdom and valor

1516
02:41:24,045 --> 02:41:27,592
have once again saved Rome
from the greatest peril.

1517
02:41:29,370 --> 02:41:32,975
Accept this laurel
from your grateful nation

1518
02:41:34,136 --> 02:41:35,725
and from your emperor.

1519
02:44:00,691 --> 02:44:03,786
Orestes, we're retiring.

1520
02:44:03,822 --> 02:44:06,739
See that the guests
have everything they need.

1521
02:44:06,779 --> 02:44:08,511
Yes, Your Majesty.

1522
02:44:08,554 --> 02:44:11,993
And may I offer you
my heartfelt congratulations?

1523
02:44:12,032 --> 02:44:14,250
You're a loyal servant, Orestes,

1524
02:44:14,295 --> 02:44:17,935
and one of the few men
I've ever counted as a friend.

1525
02:45:53,596 --> 02:45:55,957
Come, N'Kara.

1526
02:45:57,355 --> 02:45:59,014
It's time.

1527
02:46:44,085 --> 02:46:46,302
In my country, we have a custom.

1528
02:46:46,345 --> 02:46:50,306
The bride and groom have one last
toast before the wedding bed.

1529
02:46:50,381 --> 02:46:52,183
Is it permitted?

1530
02:46:53,512 --> 02:46:55,137
Of course.

1531
02:47:41,878 --> 02:47:43,336
Attila?

1532
02:48:09,922 --> 02:48:11,794
N'Kara...

1533
02:48:43,081 --> 02:48:44,954
Great King?

1534
02:48:48,543 --> 02:48:50,619
Great King?

1535
02:48:54,006 --> 02:48:56,081
Your Majesty?

1536
02:49:50,164 --> 02:49:52,108
Dead.

1537
02:51:19,341 --> 02:51:21,558
You wish to see me, Majesty?

1538
02:51:21,602 --> 02:51:25,280
Yes. We're celebrating
the death of Attila.

1539
02:51:25,326 --> 02:51:28,066
Naturally,
we wished you to be present.

1540
02:51:28,109 --> 02:51:30,364
I'm flattered.

1541
02:51:30,407 --> 02:51:35,305
Is there any chance,
I wonder, of finding his grave?

1542
02:51:37,260 --> 02:51:39,062
It's doubtful, sire.

1543
02:51:39,104 --> 02:51:43,375
The slaves who buried him will have
been killed to keep it secret.

1544
02:51:43,419 --> 02:51:46,195
It's an old Hun custom.

1545
02:51:46,238 --> 02:51:51,552
It's a pity. I had hopes of
displaying his head in the Forum.

1546
02:51:51,595 --> 02:51:54,786
No doubt, that explains the custom.

1547
02:51:54,832 --> 02:51:59,245
At any rate, it appears
that your work is finished.

1548
02:51:59,286 --> 02:52:02,831
You were set free
to deal with Attila,

1549
02:52:04,017 --> 02:52:06,092
and you've dealt with him.

1550
02:52:19,326 --> 02:52:24,818
You said, "Anything that isn't
necessary must be dispensed with. "

1551
02:52:26,216 --> 02:52:28,292
And with Attila gone...

1552
02:52:29,418 --> 02:52:31,493
