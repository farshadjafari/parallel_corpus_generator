Frank

2
00:03:34,292 --> 00:03:36,044
This is Dr. Trish Lane

3
00:03:38,137 --> 00:03:39,163
What is she doing here?

4
00:03:39,434 --> 00:03:40,217
Training

5
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:46,328
This is a nice little reunion, but
you couldnt have pick a worse possible time

6
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:53,660
Frank have been working around the clock to excavate
as much as we can before the blast, it will blow within days

7
00:03:53,763 --> 00:03:54,404
Hours!

8
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:55,953
- What?
- Within hours

9
00:03:56,529 --> 00:03:58,603
This is the latest reading that we need to evacuate

10
00:04:07,802 --> 00:04:09,473
Reaction got more frequent

11
00:04:09,778 --> 00:04:13,672
Yesterday we coming up coming a couple of hours,
now they're coming 20 to 30 minutes

12
00:04:14,899 --> 00:04:17,095
How do you know Dr. Lane?

13
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,189
We have a history together

14
00:04:19,805 --> 00:04:23,273
Next time you wanna bring somebody to take over my site,
you might wanna consult me first!

15
00:04:23,294 --> 00:04:25,242
- Dr. Richards
- Raul, you alright?

16
00:04:26,813 --> 00:04:29,214
The earthquake, it open up the third chamber

17
00:04:30,575 --> 00:04:31,457
You will come

18
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:36,863
Alright we got to get everybody out of here,
you leave me one car and we'll rendevous at El Tajin

19
00:04:51,256 --> 00:04:52,507
Follow me

20
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,385
- How can this be possible?
- I dont know

21
00:06:38,538 --> 00:06:40,142
Go...Go!

22
00:06:47,011 --> 00:06:47,960
Getup!

23
00:06:47,926 --> 00:06:49,770
Come on lets go!  Lets go!

24
00:07:10,035 --> 00:07:10,791
Raul

25
00:07:13,871 --> 00:07:15,377
Get in the car!

26
00:07:52,907 --> 00:07:53,971
Here what we know

27
00:07:55,395 --> 00:08:01,789
Seimic activity has increase exponentially over the
last 24 hours, and that increase is growing steadily

28
00:08:02,996 --> 00:08:11,620
Weather center also reporting unique climate changes all over
the globe and we have a theory that explains this activity

29
00:08:11,621 --> 00:08:14,935
We believe the earth's rotation is slowing

30
00:08:14,936 --> 00:08:20,356
due to the solar system alignment with the
black hole at the centre of the galaxy

31
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,283
Thats impossible

32
00:08:22,276 --> 00:08:25,249
Sir.
NASA known about this alignment for decades

33
00:08:26,121 --> 00:08:27,575
We run the calculations

34
00:08:27,784 --> 00:08:32,722
and theres no way that the gravational
force can significantly impact this planet

35
00:08:36,947 --> 00:08:42,108
I dont know whats causing it but I tell you, by all our calculation,
this theory is all the only one that make any sense

36
00:09:33,074 --> 00:09:34,491
?

37
00:09:34,582 --> 00:09:38,064
?

38
00:09:38,441 --> 00:09:39,254
Gracis

39
00:10:44,182 --> 00:10:44,738
Hey

40
00:10:45,421 --> 00:10:46,064
Hey

41
00:10:49,295 --> 00:10:50,404
Are you OK?

42
00:10:51,605 --> 00:10:52,440
Who are you?

43
00:10:52,966 --> 00:10:54,611
I'm just a photo journalist

44
00:10:55,692 --> 00:10:56,880
That doesnt help me at all

45
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,634
Are you alway this nice when you meet someone?

46
00:11:03,787 --> 00:11:07,523
Look, I'm sorry if I seem late,
just trying to find a doctor for 2 weeks.

47
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,291
I thought somebody might actually help

48
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,508
OK, I'm out

49
00:11:14,536 --> 00:11:15,305
Sarah

50
00:11:15,688 --> 00:11:16,624
Nice to meet you

51
00:11:18,353 --> 00:11:20,287
Look if you can to help me you can

52
00:11:22,012 --> 00:11:22,883
OK

53
00:11:34,425 --> 00:11:35,161
Missionaries

54
00:11:36,103 --> 00:11:37,744
I've been down in the source for 3 months

55
00:11:38,284 --> 00:11:41,662
Last month half the villagers become ill,
I've never seen anything like it

56
00:11:42,655 --> 00:11:43,850
5 people have died already.

57
00:11:44,476 --> 00:11:47,360
One little boy who not will see help
right away he'll gonna die.

58
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,836
Nobody in the town will help us or ?

59
00:11:50,394 --> 00:11:52,238
Nobody from city will come to town

60
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:53,785
Somebody has to help us

61
00:11:53,986 --> 00:11:55,080
OK, look I'm not a doctor

62
00:11:55,262 --> 00:11:57,608
but I did a few years in med
school so I know people,

63
00:11:57,973 --> 00:12:00,178
I'll see what I can do for the kids.
OK?

64
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:01,379
If not, I got a car

65
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,380
I'll take them to the city

66
00:12:03,728 --> 00:12:04,828
Half the village ill

67
00:12:05,346 --> 00:12:07,239
? not gonna help at all

68
00:12:10,829 --> 00:12:11,569
This way

69
00:12:51,917 --> 00:12:52,656
Hello

70
00:12:58,074 --> 00:12:58,772
OK

71
00:13:10,902 --> 00:13:12,098
Got a drive by shooting guys

72
00:13:12,723 --> 00:13:15,101
2 Bullets lodged in his chest

73
00:13:15,982 --> 00:13:16,782
Whats his name?

74
00:13:16,983 --> 00:13:17,983
Martinez

75
00:13:22,756 --> 00:13:24,415
Alright...Alrigh...Alright

76
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,321
Stand back please!

77
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:29,880
You find a pulse on him?

78
00:13:30,638 --> 00:13:31,553
Its weak. Its weak

79
00:13:33,523 --> 00:13:34,201
You have him?

80
00:13:34,402 --> 00:13:35,202
Barely

81
00:13:35,403 --> 00:13:37,064
Quick, I think I got him

82
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:42,351
Put the oxygen on him

83
00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:45,442
His blood pressure dropping

84
00:13:48,353 --> 00:13:49,140
Step back please

85
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:52,168
Let this people work

86
00:13:52,406 --> 00:13:53,167
Stand back!

87
00:13:54,724 --> 00:13:56,894
- Susan! Pulse!
- 50

88
00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:03,128
Put this, put this

89
00:14:04,598 --> 00:14:06,728
Mr Martinex, you have to seperate your hands

90
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,360
Move your hands!

91
00:14:09,859 --> 00:14:10,856
What is he saying?

92
00:14:11,648 --> 00:14:13,180
He is saying the lord's prayer

93
00:14:13,304 --> 00:14:15,898
Mr Martinez, listen to me
you have to move your hands

94
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:17,473
- Move your hands
- Move your hands

95
00:14:17,967 --> 00:14:18,737
Please!

96
00:14:18,738 --> 00:14:20,486
Please, try the action again

97
00:14:20,487 --> 00:14:21,800
Come on buddy, come on

98
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:24,870
Move you hands!

99
00:14:37,651 --> 00:14:38,848
No pulse

100
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,110
Move  back please!

101
00:15:26,238 --> 00:15:33,653
? computer is at least somewhere
between the year 300 and 600 AD

102
00:15:34,244 --> 00:15:35,088
What does that mean?

103
00:15:36,113 --> 00:15:37,752
The Mayan use crucifixation?

104
00:15:37,889 --> 00:15:41,538
No...No...No
There is no scientific to suggest that

105
00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:43,313
This is something entirely new

106
00:15:44,661 --> 00:15:45,505
Which is?

107
00:15:46,186 --> 00:15:49,062
This proves the European Christan were here long before Columbus

108
00:15:58,656 --> 00:16:01,867
We created a detailed model

109
00:16:02,382 --> 00:16:07,230
assuming that the rotation is
moving toward a complete stop

110
00:16:08,386 --> 00:16:11,392
put all the major fault areas

111
00:16:12,632 --> 00:16:14,198
and I programmed the artifcial intelligence

112
00:16:14,693 --> 00:16:17,676
to accurately move the earth's tetronic plates

113
00:16:17,774 --> 00:16:19,978
and I also download the latest weather conditions

114
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,589
and you can see other signs realistic

115
00:16:21,803 --> 00:16:25,115
pressure areas of each of the global zones

116
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:25,948
Now again,

117
00:16:26,505 --> 00:16:31,620
assumming that the aligning bringing
the planet rotation to a complete stop

118
00:16:33,584 --> 00:16:35,576
You can see the model predicting here, S2

119
00:16:37,042 --> 00:16:38,245
This is 2 hours ago

120
00:16:39,271 --> 00:16:40,355
and this is now

121
00:16:42,525 --> 00:16:44,452
the red indicate seimic activities

122
00:16:44,653 --> 00:16:46,667
the blue, the green areas are

123
00:16:46,998 --> 00:16:48,018
are weather conditions

124
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,300
it took 12 hours

125
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,580
The weather system died down

126
00:16:52,746 --> 00:16:55,037
the seismic activities peak

127
00:16:54,915 --> 00:16:57,117
when the rotation of the planet stops

128
00:16:58,993 --> 00:17:00,034
This is 24 hours

129
00:17:03,117 --> 00:17:03,914
Now

130
00:17:05,999 --> 00:17:07,191
This happen.

131
00:17:08,544 --> 00:17:12,310
The ocean will flood the West coast

132
00:17:12,311 --> 00:17:13,311
of every Continent

133
00:17:13,312 --> 00:17:17,098
America, this mean that the entire state of
Washinton, Oregon and California

134
00:17:17,756 --> 00:17:18,863
will be under water

135
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:20,610
And then what?

136
00:17:24,136 --> 00:17:25,222
Then I have no idea

137
00:17:27,488 --> 00:17:33,792
but with this information I'm making the recommendation
to the President to evacuate the entire Westcoast of the United States

138
00:17:37,024 --> 00:17:40,290
Anyone have any objection to that?

139
00:17:50,949 --> 00:17:51,968
It started a few weeks ago

140
00:17:52,181 --> 00:17:53,601
We've been trying to find a doctor even since

141
00:17:54,266 --> 00:17:55,502
How many are sick?

142
00:17:56,448 --> 00:17:57,566
Almost everyone

143
00:17:57,567 --> 00:17:59,249
It started with the children
but it spread

144
00:18:02,829 --> 00:18:03,523
Dad, Hey

145
00:18:03,843 --> 00:18:04,750
Sarah

146
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:07,333
Listen to me Sarah

147
00:18:07,334 --> 00:18:07,934
Listen

148
00:18:08,035 --> 00:18:08,698
I can't talk long

149
00:18:08,936 --> 00:18:11,416
But something is happening

150
00:18:11,617 --> 00:18:14,527
I think it going to be a big impact on Mexico,
so I want you to come home

151
00:18:15,758 --> 00:18:17,046
Wait, Dad, I can't just...

152
00:18:17,281 --> 00:18:18,304
Listen to me!

153
00:18:18,686 --> 00:18:23,077
If you can I want you to get
the next flight to your grandparent's house

154
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,155
I think it ought to be safer in the midwest

155
00:18:25,288 --> 00:18:26,752
and I can meet you there in a couple of days

156
00:18:26,953 --> 00:18:28,979
Dad, I cant pack up and leave,
I'm needed here

157
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:29,980
Sarah, Please!

158
00:18:29,981 --> 00:18:31,120
I don't have time to argue with you

159
00:18:31,155 --> 00:18:33,419
for once in your life,
will you listen to me!

160
00:18:35,051 --> 00:18:36,770
Get out as soon as you can

161
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:42,504
I love you and I'll
see you in a couple of days

162
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:44,520
Dad?

163
00:18:46,176 --> 00:18:46,753
Dad?

164
00:19:02,204 --> 00:19:03,966
The cop said he had a Green Card

165
00:19:05,981 --> 00:19:08,692
His family were all native Mayan back in Mexico

166
00:19:10,636 --> 00:19:12,852
His neighbour said he moved here a few weeks ago

167
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,121
Welcome to America, right?

168
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,898
If he would have listened to us

169
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,646
We could have saved him

170
00:19:29,095 --> 00:19:29,926
It was his time

171
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,834
- You don't really believe that do you?
- Yes I do

172
00:19:36,706 --> 00:19:42,916
When people have an illness or disease , we dont 
just say, well its their time and leave them to die

173
00:19:44,157 --> 00:19:46,919
We use our technology, our modern medicines

174
00:19:47,197 --> 00:19:48,991
to cure them, to save them

175
00:19:52,534 --> 00:19:54,959
God did not save people. We do!

176
00:19:55,646 --> 00:19:56,881
We couldn't save that man today

177
00:19:57,478 --> 00:20:00,346
If he would have listened to us, we could have saved him.
No Doubt

178
00:20:00,347 --> 00:20:01,347
But he didn't.

179
00:20:02,538 --> 00:20:03,445
He didn't

180
00:20:05,386 --> 00:20:07,076
There's a reason for everything, Susan

181
00:20:08,178 --> 00:20:11,051
Just because you can see it or don't believe it,
doesnt mean it not true

182
00:20:12,194 --> 00:20:13,294
I mean you can believe whatever you want

183
00:20:14,036 --> 00:20:16,191
but people live and people die

184
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:21,708
and we do whatever we can, we do and we do whatever
we can and we can't control that

185
00:20:24,395 --> 00:20:26,895
And you see people die everyday

186
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,331
and you still believe in God?

187
00:20:31,257 --> 00:20:32,337
Yes

188
00:20:32,886 --> 00:20:33,934
When somebody dies

189
00:20:35,924 --> 00:20:37,044
you can see the light leave them

190
00:20:38,866 --> 00:20:40,288
I mean, when they're gone

191
00:20:40,812 --> 00:20:41,848
I can feel it

192
00:20:42,569 --> 00:20:44,105
Don't you feel it when they're gone?

193
00:20:49,008 --> 00:20:51,372
I don't know, maybe I'm...

194
00:21:06,997 --> 00:21:11,509
The cross must be reunited with the Great temple

195
00:21:12,407 --> 00:21:15,027
before the end of the long Count Calendar

196
00:21:15,967 --> 00:21:17,782
The long Count Calendar sir?

197
00:21:17,783 --> 00:21:23,647
The Calendar is made of 13 cycles, that
cover a period of 5125 years

198
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:29,145
and the last cycle on the calendar is this year,
December 21st

199
00:21:29,146 --> 00:21:33,212
Now according to this, this cross is part of the phophecy.

200
00:21:33,247 --> 00:21:34,586
This cross is a national treasure.

201
00:21:34,928 --> 00:21:36,938
we have to get it back to the National Institute

202
00:21:37,399 --> 00:21:38,491
Trish

203
00:21:38,492 --> 00:21:41,465
This cross may play a key role in a historical event

204
00:21:41,788 --> 00:21:43,258
thousands of years in the making

205
00:21:43,864 --> 00:21:46,366
We have to get the cross to the temple 
before the end of the cycle

206
00:22:09,104 --> 00:22:10,366
? Do you copy

207
00:22:10,981 --> 00:22:12,100
? Go ahead

208
00:22:12,256 --> 00:22:14,580
?

209
00:22:14,681 --> 00:22:15,534
10-4. We're on it

210
00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:19,339
Look out!

211
00:22:36,306 --> 00:22:37,163
It's happening.

212
00:22:37,364 --> 00:22:40,050
The ? is in a state of unrest.

213
00:22:41,848 --> 00:22:42,624
I don't understand

214
00:22:44,048 --> 00:22:44,994
You live with them

215
00:22:45,251 --> 00:22:46,102
they're sick, your not

216
00:22:47,092 --> 00:22:47,996
What's the difference?

217
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:51,229
I'm a vegetarian

218
00:22:56,072 --> 00:22:56,836
So do you thnk its the fish?

219
00:22:57,285 --> 00:22:57,817
I don't know

220
00:22:58,008 --> 00:23:01,335
It could be some food poisoning or the
source is polluted or something

221
00:23:04,124 --> 00:23:05,275
My gosh!

222
00:23:26,475 --> 00:23:27,510
Its hot

223
00:23:29,414 --> 00:23:31,875
Those volcanic activities up north
must be heating up the river

224
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:34,626
I saw on the news this is happening in Hawaii

225
00:23:36,126 --> 00:23:37,258
Is that what killing the fish?

226
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:41,941
Increase in temperature would raise the bacteria level

227
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:44,939
My guess is something must happened here

228
00:23:46,088 --> 00:23:47,347
Wonder if it anything to do with it?

229
00:23:54,234 --> 00:23:55,079
Alright...Come on

230
00:23:55,669 --> 00:23:57,139
Lets go,  Let go

231
00:23:57,338 --> 00:23:58,300
Move it!

232
00:24:09,837 --> 00:24:10,779
Sir. We have report in Iran and Turkey

233
00:24:11,728 --> 00:24:13,984
Multliple reports in Japan and Phillipines

234
00:24:14,346 --> 00:24:16,179
Los Angeles, San Diego, Mexico City

235
00:24:16,569 --> 00:24:17,523
Italy and Romania

236
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,221
Veracruz, Mexico

237
00:24:24,031 --> 00:24:26,073
Wait...Wait...Wait...
What was that last one?

238
00:24:26,287 --> 00:24:27,647
Veracruz, Mexico Sir

239
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:53,508
<i>A Volcanic eruption ? in Orizaba</i>

240
00:24:53,782 --> 00:24:56,091
<i>the entire area has been evacuated</i>

241
00:24:56,486 --> 00:24:59,611
<i>this just in,
we now have report of similar earthquakes</i>

242
00:24:59,647 --> 00:25:03,053
<i>currently hitting Sudan, Southern Saudi Arabia</i>

243
00:25:03,287 --> 00:25:08,273
<i>the unusual seismic activities seem
to be disrupting areas around the globe</i>

244
00:25:10,026 --> 00:25:13,876
<i>I'm now being told that the President of the
United States is to make a statement</i>

245
00:25:28,638 --> 00:25:30,897
- My village
- Where is everyone?

246
00:25:34,254 --> 00:25:34,841
Hello?

247
00:25:43,131 --> 00:25:43,809
Makob

248
00:25:46,788 --> 00:25:47,834
Michelle?
Hello?

249
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:52,390
Hello?

250
00:25:59,200 --> 00:25:59,778
Hello?

251
00:26:01,706 --> 00:26:02,587
Where is everybody?

252
00:26:05,714 --> 00:26:07,029
Maybe they left because of the earthquake

253
00:26:07,078 --> 00:26:07,783
I don't know

254
00:26:09,828 --> 00:26:11,134
But they didn't take anything with them

255
00:26:14,499 --> 00:26:15,052
Makob

256
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:16,101
Hello?

257
00:26:16,862 --> 00:26:17,622
Michelle

258
00:26:18,448 --> 00:26:19,171
Makob

259
00:26:24,777 --> 00:26:26,198
The villagers were too sick to be removed

260
00:26:26,606 --> 00:26:27,795
Don't know where they would have gone

261
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:31,026
?

262
00:26:44,915 --> 00:26:46,756
Sir, its your daughter on the phone again

263
00:26:47,352 --> 00:26:48,098
Thanks god

264
00:26:48,772 --> 00:26:49,342
Sarah

265
00:26:49,677 --> 00:26:50,402
Hello

266
00:26:51,708 --> 00:26:53,363
Are you all right? Did you get a flight?

267
00:26:54,192 --> 00:26:55,428
No Dad. I'm still here

268
00:26:56,018 --> 00:26:58,448
- Something is going on, people are sick and I....
- Sarah!

269
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:02,347
I told you! you have to get out of there
as soon as you can

270
00:27:02,446 --> 00:27:03,420
Why? What happening?

271
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:06,471
The earth's rotation is slowing

272
00:27:07,128 --> 00:27:10,863
In the next 48 hours, we're going to see
a huge amount of seismic activity

273
00:27:11,572 --> 00:27:12,966
and climate changes

274
00:27:13,207 --> 00:27:16,683
The President just evacuated the entire Westcoast

275
00:27:17,231 --> 00:27:19,179
So you got to get north as fast as you can

276
00:27:19,851 --> 00:27:20,492
OK?

277
00:27:21,033 --> 00:27:21,840
OK. Yeah

278
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,311
I mean the whole world is about to fall apart

279
00:27:25,134 --> 00:27:27,371
and I just have to know that you're safe

280
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:32,545
and Sarah

281
00:27:36,448 --> 00:27:37,193
I love you

282
00:27:38,518 --> 00:27:39,607
Love you to Dad

283
00:27:39,608 --> 00:27:40,608
Well, what did he say?

284
00:27:45,037 --> 00:27:45,714
Just the beginning

285
00:27:47,145 --> 00:27:48,367
Its happening everywhere and it only to get worse

286
00:27:48,771 --> 00:27:50,070
the President evacuated the entire Westcoast

287
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:53,250
Oh my gosh

288
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:56,663
He said we suppose to head North,
my grandmother in Oklahoma

289
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,817
He said we need to go there

290
00:28:00,021 --> 00:28:02,439
OK, lets go,
my car just over the hill

291
00:28:03,589 --> 00:28:06,333
Wait, I mean...I don't know
what if I'm suppose to be here

292
00:28:06,335 --> 00:28:07,340
What if its god's plan?

293
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:10,217
What if its God's plan for us
meet so I can get us out of here?

294
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,736
I mean Sarah,
the entire village is evacuated

295
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:15,499
They probably headed North to
find safer ground

296
00:28:16,372 --> 00:28:17,494
We need to leave

297
00:28:17,811 --> 00:28:18,460
Now!

298
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:22,707
Go!

299
00:28:45,051 --> 00:28:45,536
?

300
00:28:46,164 --> 00:28:47,239
Gino?.. Gino?

301
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,655
?

302
00:28:49,966 --> 00:28:51,182
Gino, how did you know I was here?

303
00:28:51,388 --> 00:28:53,135
- ?
-OK

304
00:28:53,341 --> 00:28:54,835
?

305
00:28:55,178 --> 00:28:55,845
?

306
00:28:57,371 --> 00:28:57,937
OK

307
00:28:59,166 --> 00:28:59,696
Great

308
00:29:00,653 --> 00:29:01,445
A woman in the village is sick

309
00:29:03,822 --> 00:29:05,459
I don't know, maybe this
what I'm suppose to do

310
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,818
I feel like this is why I'm here

311
00:29:08,157 --> 00:29:08,628
I have to go

312
00:29:10,512 --> 00:29:11,191
OK

313
00:29:12,672 --> 00:29:13,341
I'm going

314
00:29:14,223 --> 00:29:15,696
- No.. wait
- I'm going

315
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,009
No..you have to get North

316
00:29:18,186 --> 00:29:19,472
- Its not safe
- Look Sarah

317
00:29:20,357 --> 00:29:21,548
You talk miracles and science

318
00:29:21,707 --> 00:29:22,973
maybe I'm here for a reason
OK

319
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,560
why I even meet you today?

320
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,369
I don't even believe in all this stuff

321
00:29:28,446 --> 00:29:29,141
I don't

322
00:29:29,336 --> 00:29:29,919
but...

323
00:29:31,958 --> 00:29:33,211
I'll think take my chances

324
00:29:35,689 --> 00:29:36,380
besides...

325
00:29:37,704 --> 00:29:38,822
who gonna take pictures?

326
00:29:41,834 --> 00:29:42,631
OK

327
00:29:43,642 --> 00:29:44,483
Lets go

328
00:29:44,484 --> 00:29:45,484
?

329
00:29:50,382 --> 00:29:51,398
- Your're not coming with us?
- No

330
00:29:51,433 --> 00:29:54,185
?

331
00:29:54,305 --> 00:29:55,270
Alright

332
00:29:57,111 --> 00:29:58,133
He's not coming with us?

333
00:30:07,128 --> 00:30:07,667
OK

334
00:30:42,782 --> 00:30:44,106
Mum!
Are you alright?

335
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,444
Katherine

336
00:30:47,507 --> 00:30:48,537
So good to see you

337
00:30:48,606 --> 00:30:49,616
Are you OK?

338
00:30:50,467 --> 00:30:51,599
I'm just fine

339
00:30:53,382 --> 00:30:55,064
They're going to evacuate the entire Westcoast

340
00:30:55,329 --> 00:30:57,345
In 2 days, this entire area
will be covered in water

341
00:30:57,449 --> 00:30:58,674
Its the apocalype Susan!

342
00:30:58,886 --> 00:30:59,878
Its the ends of day

343
00:30:59,879 --> 00:31:01,079
Mum, you know I dont't believe in that

344
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,240
You must believe!

345
00:31:02,676 --> 00:31:03,337
Please!

346
00:31:07,536 --> 00:31:08,634
This is the end Susan!

347
00:31:10,108 --> 00:31:11,299
and those that don't repent

348
00:31:12,423 --> 00:31:13,478
shall perish

349
00:31:14,025 --> 00:31:16,300
Mom, it is just an earthquake

350
00:31:16,502 --> 00:31:19,057
It is not!
It is not just an earthquake

351
00:31:28,627 --> 00:31:31,351
<i>unusally high wind recording just north....</i>

352
00:31:32,176 --> 00:31:34,006
I'm gonna just pack some thing and
we're gonna get out of here

353
00:31:34,003 --> 00:31:35,909
and where are you go? Susan

354
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,775
I don't know but its not safe here

355
00:31:38,761 --> 00:31:41,094
<i>.....interrupted major fault lines around the world</i>

356
00:31:41,082 --> 00:31:42,877
<i>destroying thousands of home, schools</i>

357
00:31:43,878 --> 00:31:45,589
<i>...from Chichen-Itza on the Uzatem Peninsula, </i>

358
00:31:46,178 --> 00:31:48,051
<i>temperature have drop to recent levels</i>

359
00:31:48,687 --> 00:31:51,281
<i>as snow begins to fall on these ancient Mayan ruins</i>

360
00:31:51,844 --> 00:31:52,721
Look... Susan

361
00:31:53,122 --> 00:31:54,222
Its the pyramids

362
00:31:55,114 --> 00:31:56,132
from your dreams

363
00:32:02,815 --> 00:32:05,862
<i>Native people are calling it end of the world ?</i>

364
00:32:06,077 --> 00:32:06,804
What did he say?

365
00:32:07,124 --> 00:32:07,991
When you were little

366
00:32:08,391 --> 00:32:10,750
you used to tell me bad dreams,
of the great big pyramids

367
00:32:10,841 --> 00:32:11,811
you drew pictures of it

368
00:32:12,484 --> 00:32:13,144
I did?

369
00:32:13,496 --> 00:32:14,467
You don't remember?

370
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:18,575
I saw a man with a tattoo like that today

371
00:32:23,843 --> 00:32:24,598
I couldn't save him

372
00:32:26,846 --> 00:32:29,273
Maybe God...
trying to show you something?

373
00:32:30,691 --> 00:32:32,979
<i>People here are taking the neccesary precautions...</i>

374
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:54,513
What time is it?

375
00:32:55,231 --> 00:32:56,195
Its after midnight

376
00:32:58,078 --> 00:32:59,155
Why is the sun still out?

377
00:33:00,403 --> 00:33:01,209
It's happening

378
00:33:01,676 --> 00:33:02,278
What's happening?

379
00:33:02,922 --> 00:33:04,723
The end of the long count cycle

380
00:33:05,787 --> 00:33:07,358
the Mayan predicted perfectly

381
00:33:08,355 --> 00:33:09,719
the sun will shine for 2 days

382
00:33:09,802 --> 00:33:11,723
and yet...
the 2nd day the sun will set

383
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:13,628
the darkness will fall

384
00:33:15,041 --> 00:33:15,939
as predicted

385
00:33:19,287 --> 00:33:20,847
How far are we from Chichen-Itza?

386
00:33:21,102 --> 00:33:22,087
About 4 hours

387
00:33:23,489 --> 00:33:24,599
It won't be long

388
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,094
The tornadoes just touched down in San Diego

389
00:34:28,068 --> 00:34:30,701
? tremedous air
circulation coming from the Artic

390
00:34:31,398 --> 00:34:33,962
Australia just saw the largest
typhoon ever recorded

391
00:34:34,259 --> 00:34:37,660
Mexico, there is a pressure system
unlike we've ever seen

392
00:34:38,244 --> 00:34:39,598
Bring up Mexico on the model

393
00:34:40,137 --> 00:34:44,445
Assuming current pressure fringe continue...
whats it gonna look like in 24 hours?

394
00:34:45,165 --> 00:34:45,791
Bleak...Sir

395
00:34:46,148 --> 00:34:47,640
This cold front is out of the world!

396
00:34:48,174 --> 00:34:50,164
hail, snow, sleet, ice,

397
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:53,662
this model predicting temperature at -20 below

398
00:34:54,204 --> 00:34:55,295
they're not prepared for this

399
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,283
its going to be a complete disaster!

400
00:35:32,387 --> 00:35:33,294
Are you OK?

401
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:35,929
Susan, whats wrong?

402
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,160
I don't know

403
00:35:37,982 --> 00:35:39,755
I just know I have to get to that pyramid

404
00:35:40,648 --> 00:35:42,712
I don't know why...
I just have to...

405
00:35:43,402 --> 00:35:45,915
In a strange time,
he's calling you

406
00:35:48,162 --> 00:35:49,445
You're very special

407
00:35:49,972 --> 00:35:51,756
Mum, you know I don't believe in that!

408
00:35:51,951 --> 00:35:55,194
Susan.. why can't you see it?
why can't you feel it he loves you?

409
00:35:55,273 --> 00:35:56,960
that he wants you to be with him?

410
00:35:57,036 --> 00:35:58,691
It doesn't make any sense, Mum

411
00:35:59,364 --> 00:36:01,948
Science can justify everything
you claim God has done

412
00:36:03,381 --> 00:36:04,180
When people get sick with...

413
00:36:04,715 --> 00:36:05,802
they live through a disease that....

414
00:36:06,194 --> 00:36:07,622
that medicine has saved them

415
00:36:07,759 --> 00:36:08,822
not God!

416
00:36:11,775 --> 00:36:16,084
I see people that go through their whole
entire lives without believing in anything

417
00:36:16,085 --> 00:36:18,007
and suddenly on their death bed

418
00:36:18,008 --> 00:36:20,014
they're sold the idea of...

419
00:36:20,564 --> 00:36:22,843
God, and heaven
and eternal life

420
00:36:26,728 --> 00:36:27,815
I watched...

421
00:36:28,961 --> 00:36:32,219
good honest people die everyday

422
00:36:33,141 --> 00:36:33,957
Where's God then?

423
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:40,139
its a nice fantasy

424
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,410
its not real

425
00:36:44,818 --> 00:36:46,066
its just the way...

426
00:36:46,377 --> 00:36:48,575
to keep people away
from dealing with reality

427
00:36:52,747 --> 00:36:53,682
its a lie

428
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,481
God love you Susan

429
00:36:57,487 --> 00:36:59,269
Whether you willing to accept that
is not...

430
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,979
its not a fantasy and
its not a lie...

431
00:37:02,901 --> 00:37:07,519
something is telling you to stop everything
and drive to a pyramid in Mexico!

432
00:37:08,332 --> 00:37:11,356
you cant describe it, you cant explain it,
but you feel it!

433
00:37:11,591 --> 00:37:13,386
Know that it exist!

434
00:37:15,206 --> 00:37:16,506
For the first time in your life

435
00:37:16,572 --> 00:37:19,237
Believe in that something
outside of yourself

436
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,851
in faith in an idea that...

437
00:37:23,957 --> 00:37:25,091
something great is happening

438
00:37:26,723 --> 00:37:28,187
in truth...
in that God

439
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,838
We were in Alaska for 6 months

440
00:37:54,235 --> 00:37:57,394
setting migration pattern for the
native American across the...

441
00:37:57,427 --> 00:37:58,280
Baring Straits

442
00:37:58,692 --> 00:38:02,232
Thats the only other time that I've seen
the Sun up at 2 O'Clock in the morning

443
00:38:05,028 --> 00:38:06,326
Frank...
Watch out!

444
00:38:08,072 --> 00:38:09,177
Go back!..Go back!

445
00:38:12,163 --> 00:38:13,760
Get out!...Get out!...

446
00:38:32,754 --> 00:38:33,372
?

447
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:34,696
No

448
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:38,823
If I don't let go,
we'll all die

449
00:38:38,686 --> 00:38:39,876
Ian, hold on!

450
00:38:42,603 --> 00:38:43,606
Good Luck

451
00:38:44,903 --> 00:38:46,014
No!

452
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:06,469
<i>You know ?</i>

453
00:39:08,078 --> 00:39:09,384
<i>why you do that?</i>

454
00:39:10,631 --> 00:39:11,713
<i>he said it was the best thing</i>

455
00:39:46,897 --> 00:39:47,884
Anna?

456
00:39:49,257 --> 00:39:49,961
Yes

457
00:39:50,225 --> 00:39:50,787
?

458
00:39:52,281 --> 00:39:53,090
Yes

459
00:39:55,155 --> 00:39:55,898
Are you sick?

460
00:39:58,371 --> 00:39:59,206
No

461
00:40:01,164 --> 00:40:02,082
Have you seen a doctor?

462
00:40:06,097 --> 00:40:06,768
No

463
00:40:12,477 --> 00:40:14,133
I don't understand.
I'm not a doctor!

464
00:40:15,259 --> 00:40:16,903
This woman could give birth any minute!

465
00:40:17,375 --> 00:40:18,613
I don't know how to operate!

466
00:40:22,944 --> 00:40:24,223
OK.... Well...

467
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:25,609
Lets get her some help

468
00:40:38,771 --> 00:40:40,050
Its not your fault!

469
00:40:40,435 --> 00:40:41,121
Its not your fault!

470
00:40:41,241 --> 00:40:42,370
He knew what he was doing

471
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,589
We could have saved him!

472
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:45,790
No we couldn't have!

473
00:40:45,491 --> 00:40:48,638
We could have all died in that hold Trish!

474
00:40:50,403 --> 00:40:51,002
OK?

475
00:40:51,121 --> 00:40:53,149
He sacrifice himself so we can go on

476
00:40:54,813 --> 00:40:57,366
I just don't know whats going on anymore!

477
00:40:57,245 --> 00:40:58,585
Its going to be alright!

478
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:00,761
No its not!

479
00:41:01,715 --> 00:41:03,376
The world is ending Frank!

480
00:41:03,548 --> 00:41:04,378
Its changing

481
00:41:05,109 --> 00:41:06,006
Its not over!

482
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:07,828
We're still here

483
00:41:08,234 --> 00:41:09,533
you know...
maybe this is a gift

484
00:41:09,734 --> 00:41:10,661
you know...

485
00:41:11,023 --> 00:41:12,511
give us a chance for a new beginning

486
00:41:13,758 --> 00:41:15,490
I dont know what to do now!

487
00:41:16,322 --> 00:41:18,218
- I dont know where to go
- Yes you do

488
00:41:18,879 --> 00:41:21,190
The prophecy has told us
exactly where to go

489
00:41:21,858 --> 00:41:22,838
The prophecy?

490
00:41:23,268 --> 00:41:24,227
Its a myth Frank!

491
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:25,412
A legend!

492
00:41:25,603 --> 00:41:26,644
No its not a myth!

493
00:41:27,388 --> 00:41:28,430
No...
its happening!

494
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:31,164
Just like they predicted 2000 years ago!

495
00:41:32,516 --> 00:41:33,369
The cross is a gift!

496
00:41:34,066 --> 00:41:36,305
delivered from God,
Christ himself or fate

497
00:41:37,721 --> 00:41:38,600
but its a gift

498
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:41,728
and its up to us

499
00:41:42,832 --> 00:41:45,245
take it to the temple and
fulfil the prophecy

500
00:41:45,327 --> 00:41:46,646
now are you with me?

501
00:41:48,601 --> 00:41:49,646
Are you with me?

502
00:41:53,499 --> 00:41:54,737
- Yes
- OK

503
00:41:57,349 --> 00:41:58,146
Alright

504
00:42:18,296 --> 00:42:19,085
OK

505
00:42:20,616 --> 00:42:21,393
OK

506
00:42:22,253 --> 00:42:23,735
Just got a little further to go...
OK?

507
00:42:24,613 --> 00:42:25,608
OK
Lets Go...

508
00:42:26,728 --> 00:42:27,977
Come on, we got to keep moving

509
00:42:28,747 --> 00:42:29,768
We're almost there Anna

510
00:42:31,922 --> 00:42:32,604
Snow

511
00:42:32,981 --> 00:42:34,127
Whats happening?

512
00:42:35,755 --> 00:42:36,526
The temperature dropping

513
00:42:37,694 --> 00:42:38,404
I don't know

514
00:42:48,287 --> 00:42:49,078
Trish!

515
00:42:49,768 --> 00:42:50,228
Trish!

516
00:42:50,631 --> 00:42:51,611
Your're bleeding

517
00:42:57,705 --> 00:42:58,838
When I jumped from the jeep...

518
00:42:58,984 --> 00:43:01,201
I hit my back on the door...
head on

519
00:43:02,331 --> 00:43:04,915
OK, your losing alot of blood,
we got to get you some help

520
00:43:09,414 --> 00:43:10,818
Come on.
My car just right over this hill

521
00:43:10,903 --> 00:43:11,723
Watch your head!

522
00:43:18,472 --> 00:43:19,910
- Your bladder?
- Yeah

523
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:38,880
This will help

524
00:43:41,502 --> 00:43:42,141
OK

525
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:48,533
She needs medical assistant!

526
00:43:48,634 --> 00:43:50,888
No!
We got to take her to the temple!

527
00:43:52,003 --> 00:43:53,761
Its happening for a reason,
I can feel it!

528
00:43:54,638 --> 00:43:55,392
Jena, was the messenger!

529
00:43:55,872 --> 00:43:56,154
What?

530
00:43:57,142 --> 00:43:57,655
Sarah, are you crazy?

531
00:43:58,273 --> 00:43:59,403
Look, we need to get her help!

532
00:43:59,404 --> 00:44:02,200
You want to drive across the country to some...
Mayan temple

533
00:44:02,731 --> 00:44:04,559
with the one about to give birth

534
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,194
just because some village boy told you so?

535
00:44:10,506 --> 00:44:11,484
we dont even know if we'll get there

536
00:44:12,553 --> 00:44:12,766
OK

537
00:44:14,165 --> 00:44:14,819
the road is going to be destroy, the bridges going to collapse

538
00:44:15,442 --> 00:44:19,746
and all I'm saying is, if we don't get
her a doctor in the city,

539
00:44:18,642 --> 00:44:19,728
we don't get her a doctor at all

540
00:44:20,183 --> 00:44:21,739
Listen to me Alex...
OK

541
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:23,140
something is happening here

542
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:24,825
I can't explain it...
I can't rationalize it....

543
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:25,940
....but I just feel it!

544
00:44:26,311 --> 00:44:27,403
I got to trust that!

545
00:44:27,986 --> 00:44:29,461
I need to get her to the pyramid

546
00:44:30,862 --> 00:44:33,639
if you don't want to help I understand...
I do... I won't think less of you

547
00:44:33,711 --> 00:44:34,945
...but I got to do this!

548
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,016
Alright

549
00:44:44,623 --> 00:44:46,336
You not gonna make it on foot,
I can tell you that

550
00:44:49,469 --> 00:44:50,153
OK...

551
00:44:51,106 --> 00:44:52,747
Get in
Lets go

552
00:45:00,705 --> 00:45:01,473
Frank

553
00:45:02,922 --> 00:45:03,955
I need you to stop!

554
00:45:17,751 --> 00:45:19,177
You still have it?

555
00:45:19,651 --> 00:45:20,685
Of course I do

556
00:45:22,241 --> 00:45:23,548
Why isnt the ring gone?

557
00:45:23,798 --> 00:45:24,873
We were never divorce

558
00:45:25,093 --> 00:45:26,196
You never had time

559
00:45:27,292 --> 00:45:29,313
Well, part of me never
wanted to make the time

560
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:37,955
You know if it make any difference...

561
00:45:39,716 --> 00:45:41,307
I haven't been with anyone else

562
00:45:43,483 --> 00:45:44,744
neither have I

563
00:45:49,887 --> 00:45:51,392
I realised it was my fault

564
00:45:53,282 --> 00:45:55,008
I took that for granted

565
00:45:56,478 --> 00:45:59,011
I always thought that...
it will be there

566
00:46:01,192 --> 00:46:02,332
when you walked out

567
00:46:03,578 --> 00:46:04,217
I dunno

568
00:46:05,741 --> 00:46:06,863
You must have seen it coming

569
00:46:06,947 --> 00:46:07,681
I didn't

570
00:46:08,172 --> 00:46:10,018
I tried to talk to you so many time

571
00:46:10,543 --> 00:46:11,393
I know

572
00:46:13,786 --> 00:46:16,432
I was so focus on me,
I just thought that...

573
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:19,578
if I were successful, the that meant
we were successful

574
00:46:21,753 --> 00:46:23,449
I know now that was not the case

575
00:46:25,323 --> 00:46:26,669
I was selfish

576
00:46:27,914 --> 00:46:29,567
and I never said that I'm sorry

577
00:46:29,908 --> 00:46:30,900
and I am

578
00:46:32,927 --> 00:46:33,890
I'm sorry

579
00:46:37,284 --> 00:46:40,954
You were the most beautiful thing that
ever happened to me and I let it slipped away

580
00:46:46,695 --> 00:46:48,078
When we first started dating

581
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:50,982
you told me I was your greatest discovery

582
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:52,353
Oh no...

583
00:46:54,703 --> 00:46:56,711
I thought that was the cutest thing

584
00:46:57,427 --> 00:47:00,292
Thats terrible...
I'm surprised you still talk to me

585
00:47:39,488 --> 00:47:40,460
Mom?

586
00:47:40,139 --> 00:47:41,531
Yeah, hunny?

587
00:47:44,002 --> 00:47:45,934
When did you started believing in God?

588
00:47:49,031 --> 00:47:50,352
I've always believed it

589
00:47:52,008 --> 00:47:52,973
But why?

590
00:47:54,085 --> 00:47:55,601
Well...
look around...

591
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:57,022
see the sun...

592
00:47:57,351 --> 00:47:59,203
shining in the sky and the...

593
00:47:59,238 --> 00:48:00,933
the clouds, and the trees

594
00:48:01,063 --> 00:48:01,687
I think...

595
00:48:03,774 --> 00:48:05,405
how perfect life is

596
00:48:06,779 --> 00:48:07,606
?

597
00:48:08,961 --> 00:48:11,067
from that great sun down to the....

598
00:48:11,287 --> 00:48:13,229
tinyiest little creature on earth

599
00:48:13,877 --> 00:48:14,827
all working together

600
00:48:16,066 --> 00:48:18,241
all one great system perfectly designed

601
00:48:20,198 --> 00:48:21,659
?

602
00:48:22,574 --> 00:48:23,274
?

603
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:25,643
It wouldn't work

604
00:48:27,607 --> 00:48:28,603
Its amazing

605
00:48:31,739 --> 00:48:33,307
I wish I saw the world in....

606
00:48:33,903 --> 00:48:34,835
You can

607
00:48:38,964 --> 00:48:40,710
You just see the dark side of things

608
00:48:41,975 --> 00:48:44,972
eases the pain and suffering of humanity

609
00:48:46,022 --> 00:48:48,389
You see death on a daily basis

610
00:48:49,948 --> 00:48:52,548
and you forget the glory of life

611
00:48:52,832 --> 00:48:54,930
its the gift...
using it everyday is a gift

612
00:48:56,674 --> 00:48:58,018
some people abuse it

613
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:01,405
and I know you seek it

614
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:05,255
and it must be so hard

615
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:11,836
and I pray to God everyday that he
would just show you the good things

616
00:49:14,946 --> 00:49:16,296
You a good thing

617
00:49:20,322 --> 00:49:21,421
You've always been a good thing

618
00:49:27,103 --> 00:49:28,707
I remember you were born

619
00:49:29,996 --> 00:49:31,211
now that was a miracle

620
00:49:33,084 --> 00:49:36,308
Oh...
I didn't believe it is finally happening

621
00:49:38,679 --> 00:49:40,734
I created you inside of me

622
00:49:42,167 --> 00:49:43,434
a child, a daughter

623
00:49:46,266 --> 00:49:47,982
When the doctor put you in my arms

624
00:49:50,979 --> 00:49:56,130
I remember thinking you were the most
incredible thing in the whole world

625
00:50:01,637 --> 00:50:03,750
we know alot of thing about the world, sweetie

626
00:50:04,852 --> 00:50:05,727
we have....

627
00:50:06,342 --> 00:50:08,390
technology, medicine

628
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:13,160
but something as beautiful and perfect
as a newborn child

629
00:50:13,573 --> 00:50:15,986
that can only come from God

630
00:50:17,089 --> 00:50:19,082
A miracle ?

631
00:50:36,865 --> 00:50:37,915

632
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:41,123

683
00:53:27,703 --> 00:53:28,454
Hunny?

684
00:54:05,787 --> 00:54:06,908
I've never seen anything like this

685
00:54:09,001 --> 00:54:09,694
Have you seen it fly?

686
00:54:11,152 --> 00:54:11,721
She'll make it

687
00:54:12,861 --> 00:54:13,577
its gonna be a bumpy ride

688
00:54:17,259 --> 00:54:19,422
I want you to know,
I'll appreciate this Jim

689
00:54:20,366 --> 00:54:22,400
I don't know what I do
if I lost Sarah too

690
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:25,429
Its hard to lose
somebody in your life

691
00:54:25,991 --> 00:54:28,711
Ruby died almost 10 years ago

692
00:54:29,042 --> 00:54:30,697
....and it still hurt sometimes

693
00:54:31,958 --> 00:54:34,582
but I feel her,
looking down at me

694
00:54:35,537 --> 00:54:36,424
I know she'll alright

695
00:54:40,636 --> 00:54:41,734
When Jess was in hospital

696
00:54:42,624 --> 00:54:43,559
she said everything was fine

697
00:54:44,561 --> 00:54:45,758
God was with her

698
00:54:47,933 --> 00:54:52,747
I prayed.... I prayed....
I prayed.... I prayed...

699
00:54:52,635 --> 00:54:53,969
for him to make her better

700
00:54:54,036 --> 00:54:56,374
I just wanted God to
save her

701
00:54:57,875 --> 00:54:58,706
and she died

702
00:54:59,994 --> 00:55:00,901
took her

703
00:55:02,717 --> 00:55:04,864
I can't tell you why Jess died,
you know

704
00:55:07,151 --> 00:55:08,909
God was not trying to hurt her

705
00:55:09,168 --> 00:55:10,098
Thats not what happened

706
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:15,950
there are things in this world that are
just impossible to understand

707
00:55:16,312 --> 00:55:20,302
the hard, the painful things but
I do believe they happen for a reason

708
00:55:21,822 --> 00:55:23,265
they teach us something.
they...

709
00:55:24,143 --> 00:55:25,320
they us down a different path

710
00:55:31,056 --> 00:55:31,929
Hold on to something

711
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:37,721
Hold on

712
00:55:38,352 --> 00:55:39,536
I'm holding....
I'm holding....

713
00:55:42,221 --> 00:55:42,907
Come on

714
00:56:23,916 --> 00:56:24,927
Come on....
Come on....

715
00:56:35,282 --> 00:56:36,071
Alright

716
00:56:40,165 --> 00:56:41,324
- Alright
- Alright

717
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:44,461
Didn't quite know what you meant
when you said bumpy

718
00:56:59,187 --> 00:57:00,028
Its so cold

719
00:57:00,963 --> 00:57:03,046
We're almost there.
Just a little further

720
00:57:06,254 --> 00:57:06,821
Frank

721
00:57:08,601 --> 00:57:09,639
No matter what happen

722
00:57:10,741 --> 00:57:11,593
You got to promise me.....

723
00:57:12,336 --> 00:57:14,185
to get this cross to the pyramid

724
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:16,038
We'll get there

725
00:57:16,874 --> 00:57:17,623
We'll get there

726
00:57:19,081 --> 00:57:19,879
Promise me?

727
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:22,101
I don't know how much
further I can go

728
00:57:22,566 --> 00:57:23,411
We'll make it

729
00:57:48,046 --> 00:57:48,417
Well...

730
00:57:50,131 --> 00:57:50,432
This is it

731
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:52,747
Aren't you coming?

732
00:57:53,957 --> 00:57:54,207
No

733
00:57:55,219 --> 00:57:56,212
As far as I go

734
00:57:57,325 --> 00:57:58,389
What?
You can't....

735
00:57:58,402 --> 00:58:00,823
fly back now,
the storm will be too intense

736
00:58:01,546 --> 00:58:02,319
this is your journey

737
00:58:03,591 --> 00:58:05,083
I was suppose to get you this far

738
00:58:07,136 --> 00:58:08,769
I don't understand

739
00:58:11,461 --> 00:58:12,515

806
01:04:50,550 --> 01:04:51,356
Well it is

807
01:04:51,637 --> 01:04:52,388
