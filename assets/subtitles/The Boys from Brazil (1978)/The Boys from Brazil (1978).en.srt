1
00:05:06,925 --> 00:05:08,008
Hey, kid!

2
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,179
Hey, Ismael.
Catch!

3
00:07:21,685 --> 00:07:24,435
Such a pleasure to see you,
Herr Lieberman.

4
00:07:24,435 --> 00:07:29,310
The pleasure is all mine,
Herr Strasser, I assure you.

5
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:33,102
I hate to bother such a famous
Nazi hunter, like yourself,

6
00:07:33,102 --> 00:07:36,853
with such trifle as the rent,
but it is the third of the month.

7
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:42,061
Quite so, you will have a cheque
in several days.

8
00:07:43,811 --> 00:07:46,436
By all means, take your time,
Herr Lieberman.

9
00:07:46,978 --> 00:07:49,562
Feel free to ignore
your responsibilities,

10
00:07:49,562 --> 00:07:52,520
while my property is being ruined.

11
00:07:52,604 --> 00:07:55,645
We have floods all over the building,
because of you.

12
00:07:56,104 --> 00:08:00,395
You overload the floor putting
a strain on the pipes upstairs,

13
00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:02,563
and then they break.

14
00:08:03,438 --> 00:08:06,980
The pipes upstairs break,
and I'm to blame?

15
00:08:07,646 --> 00:08:09,438
Everything is connected.

16
00:08:10,063 --> 00:08:12,855
The whole building will soon
collapse because of you.

17
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,813
- Ezra!
- Get out!

18
00:08:14,813 --> 00:08:17,856
- You have no right...
- You have a call from Paraguay.

19
00:08:17,856 --> 00:08:21,397
This is an apartment house,
not an office building.

20
00:08:21,397 --> 00:08:25,147
You have no right to bring in
these heavy cabbinets in here.

21
00:08:25,231 --> 00:08:26,439
All right, all right.

22
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,689
So next time rent to
a feather merchant.

23
00:08:28,897 --> 00:08:29,397
Hello.

24
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:30,732
Mr. Lieberman?

25
00:08:30,857 --> 00:08:33,732
- Out! You understand!
- You get out!

26
00:08:33,732 --> 00:08:35,690
Go and fix your rotten plumbing.

27
00:08:36,023 --> 00:08:40,023
Barry Kohler? No, I don't think
I know you.

28
00:08:40,023 --> 00:08:41,732
I sent you a package with photos.

29
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:43,773
You didn't?

30
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,941
You sound like an American.

31
00:08:46,274 --> 00:08:48,566
<i>What are you doing in Paraguay?</i>

32
00:08:49,108 --> 00:08:51,649
I've been monitoring the activities
of a group of Nazis.

33
00:08:54,024 --> 00:08:56,566
And I've identify several of them
as war criminals.

34
00:08:58,609 --> 00:09:00,192
Well, from your books and articles.

35
00:09:00,192 --> 00:09:03,984
Forty years of heartbreak and
sacrifice and you call it junk!

36
00:09:03,984 --> 00:09:05,192
Yes, junk! Junk, junk!

37
00:09:05,192 --> 00:09:08,442
Herr Strasser, we are wasting
valuable time.

38
00:09:08,442 --> 00:09:09,942
The hole up there is very
enormous.

39
00:09:10,067 --> 00:09:13,568
Huge chunks of plaster are coming
down from your ceiling.

40
00:09:13,568 --> 00:09:15,443
Look, how I step on the ground.

41
00:09:15,443 --> 00:09:17,901
Quite soon I will be through
into your apartment,

42
00:09:17,901 --> 00:09:21,943
right into the lap of your beloved
wife. God forbid.

43
00:09:22,276 --> 00:09:23,776
- Come.
- Don't push me.

44
00:09:23,776 --> 00:09:26,611
Leave my brother and me alone.
Get out!

45
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:31,527
Come, Herr Strasser.

46
00:09:46,528 --> 00:09:49,737
Esther, the man's an idiot.

47
00:09:49,737 --> 00:09:53,195
No, I'm an idiot for letting him
make me angry.

48
00:09:53,195 --> 00:09:55,738
- Go on, take your phone call.
- Oh!

49
00:09:56,446 --> 00:10:00,779
The young man who's just discovered
there are Nazis in South America.

50
00:10:02,654 --> 00:10:06,946
So, Mr. Kohler, forgive
the interruption.

51
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,280
I work alone like you,
Mr. Lieberman,

52
00:10:11,905 --> 00:10:14,864
which is why I'm calling you.
You see, I'm onto something.

53
00:10:15,322 --> 00:10:19,864
Mr. Kohler, it maybe a blinding
revelation to you,

54
00:10:19,864 --> 00:10:21,572
that there are Nazis in Paraguay,

55
00:10:21,572 --> 00:10:24,656
but I assure you, it is
no news to me.

56
00:10:24,656 --> 00:10:30,198
And if you stay there much longer,
there will still be Naziss in Paraguay,

57
00:10:30,198 --> 00:10:33,698
but there will be one less Jewish
boy in the world.

58
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,323
Something's going on.

59
00:10:36,031 --> 00:10:38,449
They seemed to be gathered
for some kind of operation.

60
00:10:38,532 --> 00:10:41,741
A bunch of them have been moving
in and out of Ralph Gunther's estate.

61
00:10:44,574 --> 00:10:46,157
I want to know what to do next.

62
00:10:46,324 --> 00:10:50,032
Get on a plane and go home, or better
still go to the American Embassy,

63
00:10:50,032 --> 00:10:54,075
run to the American Embassy and
tell them to put you on the plane.

64
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:56,867
Thank you for your advice.

65
00:11:03,658 --> 00:11:04,868
What did he want?

66
00:11:05,326 --> 00:11:06,534
I don't know.

67
00:11:07,451 --> 00:11:09,201
Advise, instructions.

68
00:11:10,451 --> 00:11:15,368
A boy like that. Lucky to survive
one day in Paraguay!

69
00:11:16,951 --> 00:11:19,202
He's been there some weeks.

70
00:11:19,202 --> 00:11:21,410
I told him to go home, anyhow.

71
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:26,660
What does he want, applause?

72
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,452
<i>One, two, three, four.</i>

73
00:11:31,035 --> 00:11:34,911
One, two, three, four.

74
00:11:35,536 --> 00:11:37,578
One, two.

75
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,953
- One, two.
<i>- One, two.</i>

76
00:11:39,953 --> 00:11:42,328
- Goddamn, it works!
<i>- Goddamn, it works!</i>

77
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:09,756
Come on, damn you, tune in.

78
00:14:10,172 --> 00:14:12,089
Gentlemen, he's coming.

79
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,965
So, Gunther,

80
00:14:31,548 --> 00:14:33,173
this is the moment.

81
00:14:48,967 --> 00:14:52,759
Gentlemen, gentlemen, be
at your ease, I beg of you.

82
00:14:54,925 --> 00:14:57,967
<i>- Gunther, would you do the honours?</i>
<i>- Certainly, Dr. Mengele.</i>

83
00:14:58,467 --> 00:14:59,509
Mengele.

84
00:15:00,217 --> 00:15:01,550
Captain Gerhart Mundt.

85
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:06,135
Yes, yes, I have heard nothing but
the highest praise for you, captain.

86
00:15:06,135 --> 00:15:07,426
Thank you, Herr Doctor.

87
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:15,510
- Major Ludwig Trausteiner.
- Thank you for coming, Major.

88
00:15:17,969 --> 00:15:19,344
- Captain...
- All right, Gunther.

89
00:15:19,344 --> 00:15:22,802
Captain Farnbach and I are
old comrades.

90
00:15:22,886 --> 00:15:24,427
Are we not, captain?

91
00:15:24,719 --> 00:15:28,552
It is extremely flattering to be
remembered after all those years, sir.

92
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:33,553
I am not so senile, or so ungrateful
that I cannot remember a loyal officer

93
00:15:33,553 --> 00:15:36,220
from the early days of the struggle.

94
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,053
And now for the youth.

95
00:15:40,637 --> 00:15:42,762
This is Dietrich Hessen,
son of Wilhelm Hessen.

96
00:15:42,762 --> 00:15:44,053
Welcome, young man.

97
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:49,346
- Wolfgang Kleist.
- I am pleased you are with us.

98
00:15:49,346 --> 00:15:50,429
Thank you, Herr Doktor.

99
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:57,346
- And Otto Schwimmer.
- A great pleasure, Herr Schwimmer.

100
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,223
And now to business.

101
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:19,056
Sit down, gentlemen, please.

102
00:16:36,391 --> 00:16:40,432
<i>The task before you</i>
<i>is the most important operation</i>

103
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:43,725
<i>that the Kamerades organization</i>
<i>has ever undertaken.</i>

104
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:47,183
It is the vital link in a programme

105
00:16:47,183 --> 00:16:52,475
to which I and your leaders have
devoted many years of huge effort.

106
00:16:53,017 --> 00:16:57,309
Your success on this project
carries with it the hope

107
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:59,809
and destiny of the Aryan race.

108
00:17:00,476 --> 00:17:04,393
And that is not an exageration,
but the literal truth.

109
00:17:05,184 --> 00:17:07,101
It is a holy mission, gentlemen.

110
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,060
You should consider yourselves
highly honoured

111
00:17:11,894 --> 00:17:13,810
to have been chosen
to perform it.

112
00:17:20,185 --> 00:17:21,769
Now for the details.

113
00:17:24,645 --> 00:17:27,561
In the next two-an-half years,
ninety-four men

114
00:17:27,561 --> 00:17:30,978
must die on or near certain dates.

115
00:17:32,603 --> 00:17:35,603
Sixteen of these men are
in West Germany,

116
00:17:35,895 --> 00:17:39,479
fourteen in Sweden,
thirteen in England,

117
00:17:39,771 --> 00:17:43,729
twelve in the United States,
ten in Norway,

118
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,062
nine in Austria,
eight in Holland,

119
00:17:46,062 --> 00:17:49,354
and six each in Denmark
and Canada.

120
00:17:51,855 --> 00:17:54,147
A total of ninety-four

121
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,480
assassinations.

122
00:18:05,231 --> 00:18:06,023
All of these men

123
00:18:06,023 --> 00:18:10,273
<i>will be sixty-five years old</i>
<i>when their dates come around.</i>

124
00:18:10,273 --> 00:18:14,648
<i>Obviously, a few of them will already</i>
<i>have died of natural causes.</i>

125
00:18:15,939 --> 00:18:17,273
Yes, Farnbach.

126
00:18:17,439 --> 00:18:19,899
Who are these men?
Jews?

127
00:18:21,315 --> 00:18:22,607
Not one.

128
00:18:23,565 --> 00:18:26,940
They are all family men,
tax inspectors,

129
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,899
civil servants, school principals,
men of minor authority.

130
00:18:30,732 --> 00:18:32,857
<i>Are we permitted to hire</i>
<i>accomplices?</i>

131
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:35,733
<i>Accomplices?</i>
<i>I would not advise it.</i>

132
00:18:35,733 --> 00:18:39,275
<i>Bear it in mind, these are</i>
<i>sixty-five year old men.</i>

133
00:18:39,275 --> 00:18:44,733
<i>Their eyesight is failing, they have</i>
<i>slow reflexes, diminished strength.</i>

134
00:18:46,108 --> 00:18:48,484
I've been through Sweden
quite a bit,

135
00:18:48,484 --> 00:18:51,109
but I've never heard of this place,
Rasbo.

136
00:18:51,401 --> 00:18:56,317
It is a village. About fifteen
kilometres from Upsala.

137
00:18:57,984 --> 00:19:01,652
That is Bertile Hayden, the post
master, there.

138
00:19:02,152 --> 00:19:05,110
And by killing this old mail man

139
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:09,027
I will be fulfilling the destiny
of the Aryan race?

140
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:15,778
You wish to be relieved
of this assignment, captain Mundt?

141
00:19:17,236 --> 00:19:18,319
No, sir.

142
00:19:19,403 --> 00:19:21,819
Then, do not question your orders.

143
00:19:22,736 --> 00:19:24,153
Simply obey them.

144
00:19:25,403 --> 00:19:26,653
Yes, Herr Doktor.

145
00:19:27,653 --> 00:19:28,986
I apologise.

146
00:19:32,112 --> 00:19:33,404
Further questions?

147
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:46,946
<i>The men's families are not</i>
<i>to be involved.</i>

148
00:19:47,821 --> 00:19:50,030
<i>And in the case of say younger</i>
<i>wives</i>

149
00:19:50,738 --> 00:19:55,696
<i>who might be open to romantic</i>
<i>overtures as accomplices.</i>

150
00:19:56,405 --> 00:20:00,614
<i>I repeat, the families are not</i>
<i>to be involved.</i>

151
00:20:01,156 --> 00:20:03,447
<i>You will travel and live in a manner</i>
<i>befitting</i>

152
00:20:03,447 --> 00:20:05,697
<i>salesmen, for large German firms.</i>

153
00:20:05,697 --> 00:20:10,197
You'll have more than enough money
for any equipment you might need.

154
00:20:11,322 --> 00:20:15,782
It is vital that you check in
with headquarters on the first...

155
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:26,616
Find it!

156
00:20:28,991 --> 00:20:30,283
Find it!

157
00:21:22,328 --> 00:21:23,203
Sir!

158
00:21:42,371 --> 00:21:44,788
All right, Mr. Lieberman,
listen to this.

159
00:21:45,163 --> 00:21:47,079
<i>Killing this old mail man,</i>

160
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:50,955
<i>I will be fulfulling the destiny</i>
<i>of the Aryan race?</i>

161
00:23:46,922 --> 00:23:48,838
Operator, any word of my call yet?

162
00:24:14,424 --> 00:24:15,299
Hello.

163
00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:18,424
Kohler!

164
00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:21,590
I thought I told you to leave.

165
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:25,300
Well, I didn't Mr. Lieberman, but I think
you're going to be glad I didn't.

166
00:24:26,258 --> 00:24:29,716
Doktor Josef Mengele was here
tonight.

167
00:24:29,716 --> 00:24:33,508
You mean to tell me you've called
me up at 3 o'clock in the morning

168
00:24:33,508 --> 00:24:36,216
to tell me Doktor Josef Mengele
is in Paraguay?

169
00:24:36,216 --> 00:24:40,384
I know that, Mr. Kohler,
so does my sister,

170
00:24:40,384 --> 00:24:45,926
so does my landlord, and my tailor,
and now you know it too.

171
00:24:45,926 --> 00:24:46,967
My congratulations!

172
00:24:46,967 --> 00:24:49,426
He came to a meeting at Gunther's
house tonight.

173
00:24:49,592 --> 00:24:50,926
The others were there too.

174
00:24:51,884 --> 00:24:55,885
Mengele's sending them out to kill
ninety-four, sixty-five year old men

175
00:24:55,885 --> 00:24:57,718
in the next two-an-half years.

176
00:24:57,927 --> 00:25:00,343
What are you talking about?

177
00:25:02,802 --> 00:25:06,803
Ninety-four at sixty-five...

178
00:25:07,928 --> 00:25:10,011
two-an-half years.

179
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:15,553
I can hear you, Mr. Kohler, I just
can't follow what you're saying.

180
00:25:19,386 --> 00:25:23,220
<i>Goddamn it, you don't have to</i>
<i>believe me, I've got it all on tape.</i>

181
00:25:24,012 --> 00:25:27,304
<i>All of them, Europe, Canada,</i>
<i>the United States.</i>

182
00:25:28,929 --> 00:25:30,262
Mostly civil servants.

183
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:45,513
Okay, I'm running it down now.
It'll only take a second.

184
00:25:46,055 --> 00:25:51,806
Take your time, old men don't go back
to sleep once they've been awakened.

185
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:02,057
<i>- Welcome, young man.</i>
- The stuff on now, it's just a lot of

186
00:26:02,057 --> 00:26:04,182
introducing and glad handing around.

187
00:26:04,973 --> 00:26:07,515
Mengele is acting like chairman
of the board.

188
00:26:09,057 --> 00:26:12,098
Will you stop asking questions
and just listen Mr. Lieberman?

189
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:16,808
Okay, here it comes.

190
00:26:18,016 --> 00:26:20,266
<i>The task before you is</i>
<i>the most important...</i>

191
00:26:26,933 --> 00:26:27,683
Kohler!

192
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:32,600
Are you there, Kohler?

193
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:34,184
Kohler!

194
00:26:36,017 --> 00:26:38,142
<i>... your success on this project...</i>

195
00:26:46,893 --> 00:26:47,726
Kohler.

196
00:27:03,311 --> 00:27:04,477
Clean the room.

197
00:27:05,477 --> 00:27:06,977
Dispose of the body.

198
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:12,353
I do not want a trace
of this vermin to remain.

199
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:28,229
Everything is all right,
you can take care of the police.

200
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:31,271
- Who was the boy calling?
- It does not matter.

201
00:27:31,646 --> 00:27:34,604
- Perhaps you should wait?
- We wait for nothing,

202
00:27:34,604 --> 00:27:36,979
the fourth Reich is coming, Gunther.

203
00:27:36,979 --> 00:27:39,563
Our men will leave tomorrow
as planned.

204
00:27:52,647 --> 00:27:53,689
Kill him.

205
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:10,566
Is there no way of checking
this further?

206
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:14,899
All right, thank you.

207
00:28:16,774 --> 00:28:20,982
The Vienna telephone exchange says
there was a call from Paraguay,

208
00:28:20,982 --> 00:28:23,775
but Paraguay say that no such call
took place.

209
00:28:25,233 --> 00:28:28,733
I have finally found a couple
of things from that boy.

210
00:28:33,817 --> 00:28:34,608
Mundt!

211
00:28:35,983 --> 00:28:38,734
Captain in a Death-Head Regiment.

212
00:28:39,068 --> 00:28:41,484
Farnbach, a Gestapo agent.

213
00:28:41,859 --> 00:28:45,693
Trausteiner! Assistant commandant,
at Dachau.

214
00:28:45,693 --> 00:28:48,651
Cheap bureaucrats and murderers.

215
00:28:48,734 --> 00:28:49,818
And these...

216
00:28:51,735 --> 00:28:52,860
who knows.

217
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:56,944
- Ezra, you know, you shouldn't.
- Esther, Esther,

218
00:28:56,944 --> 00:29:00,527
after all I've been through,
one puff won't hurt me.

219
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,403
These...

220
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:15,986
Colonel Eduard Seibert, he's
the adjutant to Rausch,

221
00:29:15,986 --> 00:29:18,195
the head of the Kamerads
organization.

222
00:29:18,195 --> 00:29:23,737
He was in command of the
extermination units on the Eastern Front.

223
00:29:23,737 --> 00:29:25,321
He's a real aristocrat,

224
00:29:25,321 --> 00:29:29,154
what's he doing in such
undistinguished company?

225
00:29:29,321 --> 00:29:32,154
And then, it wasn't a hoax after all.

226
00:29:33,613 --> 00:29:34,238
Esther,

227
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,988
on the telephone, after that boy
was cut off,

228
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,363
I felt something...

229
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:45,613
something in the silence,
something alive,

230
00:29:46,906 --> 00:29:47,739
and...

231
00:29:49,698 --> 00:29:50,906
hateful.

232
00:29:54,198 --> 00:29:56,364
Maybe, I'm getting senile.

233
00:29:57,156 --> 00:29:58,573
You haven't got the time.

234
00:30:03,615 --> 00:30:08,449
Ninety-four...
ordinary men.

235
00:30:30,576 --> 00:30:31,659
<i>Beynon!</i>

236
00:30:34,742 --> 00:30:36,076
Oh, Christ!

237
00:30:38,409 --> 00:30:41,909
Mr. Beynon, so nice to see you again.

238
00:30:42,535 --> 00:30:45,952
- How are you getting along?
- Can't complain, who'd listen.

239
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:50,910
- May I take up a moment of your time?
- I'm so sorry, I'm late for lunch.

240
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:54,202
Oh, always such a prodigious
appetite.

241
00:30:54,202 --> 00:30:54,868
What?

242
00:30:54,868 --> 00:30:57,119
Eight times last week I call you

243
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:01,036
and each time you are at lunch.
Maybe you have a tate warm?

244
00:31:01,369 --> 00:31:05,786
Now, Sidney, please, just a few
moments of your time.

245
00:31:08,661 --> 00:31:10,286
Very well, come on.

246
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:14,704
Ezra, you carry this whole
damn concentration camp thing

247
00:31:14,704 --> 00:31:16,120
pinned to your coat-tails.

248
00:31:17,162 --> 00:31:19,454
Why do you keep knocking
yourself out?

249
00:31:19,662 --> 00:31:21,370
Nothing ever pays off.

250
00:31:22,662 --> 00:31:24,621
Frieda Maloney is in jail.

251
00:31:24,621 --> 00:31:27,955
Frieda Maloney! She was
only a guard in a camp.

252
00:31:28,413 --> 00:31:31,330
She strangled young girls with
their own hair,

253
00:31:31,455 --> 00:31:34,705
bayonetted infants.
- Maybe she was a despicable criminal,

254
00:31:34,705 --> 00:31:37,246
but she just isn't news
thirty years later.

255
00:31:42,414 --> 00:31:46,706
Sidney, there is a plot by
the Kamerads Organization,

256
00:31:46,706 --> 00:31:48,206
which is the illegal army...

257
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:49,456
Yes, I know what it is.

258
00:31:50,289 --> 00:31:54,998
They plan to kill ninety-four men
in the next two-an-half years.

259
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:57,082
Jews, I suppose?

260
00:31:57,873 --> 00:32:02,082
I want your European, Canadian
and American bureaus

261
00:32:02,082 --> 00:32:03,415
to send you clippings

262
00:32:03,415 --> 00:32:09,041
of all sixty-five year old civil
servants who die accidentally.

263
00:32:09,416 --> 00:32:11,458
You pass them to me and
I'll go through them.

264
00:32:12,499 --> 00:32:14,374
And whose plot is this?

265
00:32:15,458 --> 00:32:16,791
Josef Mengele.

266
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:20,333
He's the red herring
in this little barrel?

267
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:25,584
What a title for the chief doctor
of Auschwitz

268
00:32:25,584 --> 00:32:28,334
who killed two-an-half million people,

269
00:32:28,334 --> 00:32:32,625
experimented on children, Jewish
and non-Jewish,

270
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:38,501
using twins mostly, injecting
blue dyes into their eyes

271
00:32:38,501 --> 00:32:40,376
to make them acceptable Aryans.

272
00:32:40,376 --> 00:32:41,001
Ezra.

273
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:44,793
Amputating limbs and organs
from thousands,

274
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:50,461
operating without anaesthetic, but
with the strenght of Wagner

275
00:32:50,461 --> 00:32:55,794
providing an obligato to the screams
of the mutons he was creating.

276
00:32:55,794 --> 00:32:57,044
Don't lecture me!

277
00:32:59,002 --> 00:33:00,044
Sidney,

278
00:33:01,336 --> 00:33:03,212
you owe me something.

279
00:33:04,587 --> 00:33:07,753
Even if only to humour an old man

280
00:33:07,753 --> 00:33:11,503
who once brought you page
one international story.

281
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:14,128
You owe me this much, Sidney.

282
00:33:15,087 --> 00:33:16,879
Now, I'm collecting.

283
00:33:23,171 --> 00:33:25,754
Have you any idea how many
men in their mid-sixties,

284
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:26,879
die every day?

285
00:33:28,879 --> 00:33:30,629
I try not to think about it.

286
00:33:59,882 --> 00:34:02,091
Save it for your wife,
Herr Doring.

287
00:34:02,632 --> 00:34:04,674
What I've got is too good
for her.

288
00:34:04,674 --> 00:34:06,716
I can feel that, Herr Doring.

289
00:34:08,507 --> 00:34:09,591
Go on, go on.

290
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:12,757
Pig.

291
00:36:07,433 --> 00:36:08,558
Good boy.

292
00:36:09,391 --> 00:36:10,641
Good boy.

293
00:37:49,857 --> 00:37:50,857
Seibert!

294
00:37:51,857 --> 00:37:52,898
News?

295
00:37:53,065 --> 00:37:56,315
Good news, our salesmen have
all checked in.

296
00:37:56,648 --> 00:38:00,358
The first quotas have been filled,
all on the exact dates.

297
00:38:00,899 --> 00:38:02,941
Two a day early and one
a day late.

298
00:38:02,941 --> 00:38:05,524
Splendid, splendid!
Come.

299
00:38:06,233 --> 00:38:07,899
We'll have a nice lunch.

300
00:38:33,193 --> 00:38:37,193
Colonel, I will need to have a full
report on all this for my records.

301
00:38:38,193 --> 00:38:40,277
I've already taken care of that.

302
00:38:52,236 --> 00:38:55,612
Four out of seven on the exact dates.

303
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,112
They are good men.

304
00:38:59,028 --> 00:39:00,570
Well chosen.

305
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:03,695
General Rausch called me
yesterday from the Costa Brava.

306
00:39:07,153 --> 00:39:09,321
Why didn't you tell us
about Lieberman?

307
00:39:14,321 --> 00:39:16,404
I did not think this was necessary.

308
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:18,654
The General is concerned.

309
00:39:19,988 --> 00:39:23,989
But Ezra Lieberman,
no one takes him seriously.

310
00:39:24,405 --> 00:39:27,364
Even the rich Jews who used
to send him money,

311
00:39:27,364 --> 00:39:29,989
have found better ways
to ease their consciences.

312
00:39:29,989 --> 00:39:31,822
The man's bank has failed,

313
00:39:31,822 --> 00:39:33,947
his followers have fallen
away from him.

314
00:39:33,947 --> 00:39:39,281
He's entirely without credibility,
I just decided he was not important.

315
00:39:39,615 --> 00:39:42,990
If you'll forgive me, Herr Doktor,
it was not your decision to make.

316
00:39:43,573 --> 00:39:46,698
You could have compromised
their agents all over the world.

317
00:39:47,448 --> 00:39:49,824
And if I have told you
about Lieberman,

318
00:39:49,824 --> 00:39:52,991
you would have compromised
my project.

319
00:39:55,157 --> 00:39:59,241
How bad would it be if we postponed
for three or four months?

320
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:03,408
That would reduce the outcome by...

321
00:40:03,825 --> 00:40:06,908
twenty percent, there are 18 men
in the first four months

322
00:40:06,908 --> 00:40:09,200
it would change the results
completely.

323
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,033
Assuming that there is an outcome.

324
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:14,242
There'll be exactly the results
I have promised.

325
00:40:15,283 --> 00:40:19,784
General Rausch wanted to recall
these six men.

326
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:20,451
Impossible!

327
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:22,784
Until we find out how much
Lieberman knows.

328
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:26,243
Impossible, this project has
a timetable

329
00:40:26,243 --> 00:40:28,701
that muste be observed,
it cannot be changed.

330
00:40:28,701 --> 00:40:29,576
Herr Doktor...

331
00:40:29,576 --> 00:40:33,785
Colonel, do you fully understand
what it is that I have done?

332
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,619
I, the outlaw,

333
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:39,660
the so-called war criminal.

334
00:40:40,327 --> 00:40:42,994
Right here in this God-forsaken
place,

335
00:40:42,994 --> 00:40:45,327
I have created a scientific miracle.

336
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,953
I have turned the whole world
into a laboratory.

337
00:40:48,953 --> 00:40:50,703
Our laboratory.

338
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,536
Don't talk me about six men.

339
00:40:53,953 --> 00:40:56,578
I would send out six more
if they were caught,

340
00:40:56,578 --> 00:41:01,287
and six more, and six more,
until the task was done.

341
00:41:01,287 --> 00:41:03,371
I agree, Herr Doktor, I agree.

342
00:41:04,287 --> 00:41:06,871
I hope that we can resolve
this Lieberman business,

343
00:41:06,871 --> 00:41:12,746
and that you get to put 94 check
marks on that beautiful chart of yours.

344
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:14,497
Come.

345
00:41:15,372 --> 00:41:16,705
Walk me to the plane.

346
00:41:20,122 --> 00:41:24,372
You see how passionate I am
on this subject.

347
00:41:24,372 --> 00:41:25,288
Uh huh!

348
00:41:25,997 --> 00:41:28,498
To think that one day this place
will be a shrine

349
00:41:28,498 --> 00:41:30,873
to be visited by millions
of school-children.

350
00:41:32,081 --> 00:41:36,289
Yes, that is a nice thought.
Yes, Doktor.

351
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,168
Gladbeck, three-thirty, Ezra.

352
00:42:31,168 --> 00:42:35,168
We'll get there, we'll get there,
when do I ever miss a train?

353
00:42:35,377 --> 00:42:38,836
Now you know what to do
while I'm away?

354
00:42:38,836 --> 00:42:42,669
Go through all those clippings,
separate them by countries, cities,

355
00:42:43,003 --> 00:42:45,711
try to isolate all violent crime.

356
00:42:45,878 --> 00:42:49,211
Ezra, there are already more than
a hundred clippings

357
00:42:49,211 --> 00:42:51,294
and Beynon called to say there are
more to come.

358
00:42:51,503 --> 00:42:53,545
Well, we have to start somewhere.

359
00:42:54,212 --> 00:42:57,920
Yes, yes, but we can't afford to hunt
for all those men.

360
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,337
Well, that's why I'm going
to these cities first,

361
00:43:00,337 --> 00:43:04,504
because they are the closest
and the cheapest, it's the begining.

362
00:43:04,504 --> 00:43:05,880
Yes, but you know that...

363
00:43:05,963 --> 00:43:09,671
Remember to separate the ones
in New England from the rest.

364
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:11,921
I can cover them while I'm
on the lecture tour.

365
00:43:12,796 --> 00:43:14,671
Still, without any help.

366
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:19,338
Without help, without money,
without time, what else is new?

367
00:44:18,926 --> 00:44:20,051
The landlord!

368
00:44:21,843 --> 00:44:23,010
Where are you going?

369
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:26,176
- To turn that damn tape off.
- Leave it, I like music.

370
00:44:27,093 --> 00:44:28,551
Well, he doesn't.

371
00:44:29,844 --> 00:44:32,511
He'll prowl round the landing
listening at my door,

372
00:44:32,511 --> 00:44:35,511
- just waiting to catch me.
- Catch you? Doing what?

373
00:44:35,719 --> 00:44:37,552
Just what we're doing now, love.

374
00:44:37,802 --> 00:44:40,761
Mr. Harrington doesn't like
any mucking-around in his house,

375
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:43,636
he has a wife and kid, you know.
Old coot!

376
00:44:43,636 --> 00:44:45,803
Bet he wouldn't say no
if I invited him in here.

377
00:44:49,595 --> 00:44:51,095
Then maybe we'll invite him in.

378
00:44:52,678 --> 00:44:53,678
Later.

379
00:45:18,347 --> 00:45:21,680
Is this Frau Doring's residence?
My name is Lieberman.

380
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,390
Good.

381
00:45:38,223 --> 00:45:40,557
I think she's off the phone by now.

382
00:45:41,349 --> 00:45:43,224
You're her grandson?

383
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:45,141
Her son.

384
00:45:52,307 --> 00:45:53,766
Herr Lieberman!

385
00:45:56,433 --> 00:46:00,142
Frau Doring, thank you so much
for seeing me.

386
00:46:00,767 --> 00:46:02,767
Won't you sit down?

387
00:46:02,767 --> 00:46:03,767
Thank you.

388
00:46:13,309 --> 00:46:17,684
You are the same man they had
on television, several months ago.

389
00:46:18,143 --> 00:46:20,976
The Nazi hunter.
Frieda Maloney.

390
00:46:23,644 --> 00:46:25,769
Do you kill Nazis when
you catch them?

391
00:46:26,352 --> 00:46:29,810
That's against the law, it's
much better to put them on trial

392
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:32,435
- so people can learn.
- Learn what?

393
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:36,936
Who they were, what they did.

394
00:46:37,436 --> 00:46:39,103
So why even catch them?

395
00:46:39,978 --> 00:46:42,020
Just put it all in history books.

396
00:46:45,561 --> 00:46:48,020
Clever boy you have here,
Frau Doring.

397
00:46:48,478 --> 00:46:51,521
Yes, but definitely lazy.

398
00:46:52,396 --> 00:46:57,271
For example, right now he should
be in his room practising.

399
00:46:57,271 --> 00:47:01,479
I can't be in my room and answer
the door at the same time, can I?

400
00:47:01,479 --> 00:47:04,605
Oh! I was only teasing, darling.

401
00:47:06,688 --> 00:47:10,480
Now, please go and practise.

402
00:47:31,023 --> 00:47:33,232
Now we can talk.

403
00:47:33,899 --> 00:47:37,524
First of all, may I express
my sympathy,

404
00:47:37,524 --> 00:47:41,440
things must be very difficult
for you right now.

405
00:47:42,107 --> 00:47:43,107
Thank you.

406
00:47:44,524 --> 00:47:46,775
Is he your only child?

407
00:47:47,733 --> 00:47:48,608
Yes.

408
00:47:49,108 --> 00:47:53,900
Did your husband leave all his money
to Erich and you?

409
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:55,775
And to a sister of his.

410
00:47:56,525 --> 00:47:57,983
Why do you ask that?

411
00:47:58,983 --> 00:48:02,734
I was looking for a reason
behind his death.

412
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:05,526
Emil's death was an accident.

413
00:48:06,901 --> 00:48:08,401
Was he a Nazi?

414
00:48:08,651 --> 00:48:13,442
I did not meet him until 1955,
so I have no way of knowing.

415
00:48:14,151 --> 00:48:20,068
Did he ever mention the name
of a Doktor Josef Mengele?

416
00:48:20,485 --> 00:48:21,277
Who?

417
00:48:22,027 --> 00:48:26,652
There was a considerable age
difference between you two.

418
00:48:27,193 --> 00:48:29,278
That wasn't the only difference.

419
00:48:30,028 --> 00:48:33,069
I was twenty, straight off the farm

420
00:48:33,069 --> 00:48:36,569
and he was Mr. High-an-Mighty
of the Transport Commission.

421
00:48:37,694 --> 00:48:39,986
Forty-three, I think he was.

422
00:48:41,528 --> 00:48:46,070
- Did he have any hobbies?
- No.

423
00:48:49,695 --> 00:48:50,529
Yes.

424
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:55,070
Yes, he did have one special hobby,
Herr Lieberman.

425
00:48:55,904 --> 00:49:00,155
He humiliated and beat my son
at every given opportunity.

426
00:49:02,113 --> 00:49:05,238
Would you like me to tell you
who really killed him?

427
00:49:06,821 --> 00:49:07,946
God.

428
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:14,031
To set free a stupid little farm girl after
twenty-two years of unhappiness.

429
00:49:15,572 --> 00:49:18,447
Do Nazis answer prayers,
Herr Lieberman?

430
00:49:19,156 --> 00:49:20,156
No.

431
00:49:20,364 --> 00:49:22,239
That is God's business.

432
00:49:23,156 --> 00:49:25,740
And I have thanked him every night,

433
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:30,657
since he pushed Emil
under that car.

434
00:49:33,115 --> 00:49:34,865
He could have done it sooner.

435
00:49:35,948 --> 00:49:37,948
But I thank him anyway.

436
00:50:20,410 --> 00:50:22,369
Who the hell are you?

437
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:25,994
Come in, Mr. Harrington.
She wants to talk to you.

438
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:28,619
I'll talk to her.

439
00:50:29,952 --> 00:50:30,994
That would be nice.

440
00:50:48,162 --> 00:50:49,079
John!

441
00:50:50,371 --> 00:50:51,246
John!

442
00:50:54,371 --> 00:50:57,621
Simon, stop playing with those puppets
and go and wash your hands for tea.

443
00:50:57,621 --> 00:51:00,288
- Hallo.
<i>- I'm on my way, mother.</i>

444
00:51:01,413 --> 00:51:03,247
If you'll hold on, I'll just get her.

445
00:51:05,622 --> 00:51:06,664
<i>Nancy!</i>

446
00:51:07,414 --> 00:51:10,164
<i>Nancy! Telephone, Nancy.</i>

447
00:51:12,122 --> 00:51:13,580
Nancy!

448
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:14,705
<i>Nancy!</i>

449
00:51:15,622 --> 00:51:16,623
Nancy!

450
00:51:17,123 --> 00:51:18,165
<i>Nancy!</i>

451
00:51:18,165 --> 00:51:20,790
Come on, Nancy, you can't spend
your life in bed.

452
00:51:30,999 --> 00:51:32,041
Nancy!

453
00:52:03,584 --> 00:52:07,418
Good, good, incredibly precise.

454
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:11,834
Everything right on schedule.

455
00:52:12,126 --> 00:52:15,502
You didn't have to make the trip,
Seibert, you could have used the radio.

456
00:52:15,752 --> 00:52:19,627
Not that I do not welcome a little
intelligent company down here.

457
00:52:20,002 --> 00:52:23,627
Gunther remembered the digital
clock you admired so much

458
00:52:23,627 --> 00:52:24,877
in his home.

459
00:52:26,335 --> 00:52:28,711
Well, thank you, my friend.

460
00:52:30,461 --> 00:52:31,711
Very nice of you.

461
00:52:34,545 --> 00:52:36,586
Such a rational device.

462
00:52:37,295 --> 00:52:39,628
- Remarkable.
- There is a problem.

463
00:52:41,629 --> 00:52:42,546
Lieberman.

464
00:52:43,004 --> 00:52:45,254
He was in Gladbeck,
in Doring's house.

465
00:52:51,004 --> 00:52:53,421
Possibly he found out about Doring.

466
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:55,255
You don't know?

467
00:52:56,005 --> 00:52:57,130
How could I?

468
00:52:57,463 --> 00:53:00,338
- The boy, Kohler?
- Impossible.

469
00:53:01,047 --> 00:53:03,505
Then, how did Lieberman
get to Doring?

470
00:53:05,505 --> 00:53:06,963
Sheer coincidence.

471
00:53:07,463 --> 00:53:11,381
That's not a very scientific
explanation, is it, Doktor?

472
00:53:11,964 --> 00:53:15,298
Are you interrogating me,
colonel Seibert?

473
00:53:16,006 --> 00:53:19,089
General Rausch put me in charge of
security for this project.

474
00:53:19,964 --> 00:53:22,298
How can I function, if I don't have
all the facts?

475
00:53:22,298 --> 00:53:23,549
But you do!

476
00:53:23,757 --> 00:53:28,549
A nosey, incompetent, old Jew
has bumbled onto one victim,

477
00:53:28,799 --> 00:53:30,799
what more do you have to know?

478
00:53:31,257 --> 00:53:35,632
Any idiot could see the next
logical step. Kill him!

479
00:53:35,799 --> 00:53:37,883
We don't want to create a martyr.

480
00:53:38,008 --> 00:53:38,841
Ridiculous!

481
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:42,008
Besides, he could have contacted
various police agencies,

482
00:53:42,383 --> 00:53:44,008
or intelligence services.

483
00:53:44,008 --> 00:53:46,341
They would not pay any attention
to him.

484
00:53:46,758 --> 00:53:49,675
If he died suddenly, they would.

485
00:53:50,216 --> 00:53:51,217
Well.

486
00:53:52,342 --> 00:53:54,967
Then, what are you going to do?

487
00:53:55,967 --> 00:53:58,759
Lieberman will have to be watched
more carefully from now on.

488
00:53:58,759 --> 00:54:01,842
If he seems to be getting closer
to us, a decision will be made.

489
00:54:02,134 --> 00:54:05,802
We will balance the danger
of killing Lieberman

490
00:54:05,802 --> 00:54:09,010
against the scientific validity
of your project.

491
00:54:09,343 --> 00:54:12,968
Are you, my esteemed
Chief of Security

492
00:54:12,968 --> 00:54:18,302
telling me that a project twenty years
and millions of dollars in the making,

493
00:54:18,302 --> 00:54:22,011
will be dropped because of
this insignificant impudent, old Jew?

494
00:54:22,469 --> 00:54:25,261
It wouldn't do to antagonize me,
Doktor Mengele.

495
00:54:25,511 --> 00:54:27,428
I've been one of your few supporters,

496
00:54:27,428 --> 00:54:29,219
since this Lieberman business
began.

497
00:54:29,678 --> 00:54:33,887
And should I drop to my knees
in gratitude?

498
00:54:35,262 --> 00:54:36,470
Listen to me, Seibert,

499
00:54:36,929 --> 00:54:41,720
I will not permit you to lay your
failure, or your fear at my door.

500
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:44,554
I am a scientist, I have done my job.

501
00:54:45,012 --> 00:54:46,930
You are an executioner!

502
00:54:47,638 --> 00:54:48,930
Do yours!

503
00:55:16,557 --> 00:55:17,682
Ezra!

504
00:55:26,098 --> 00:55:28,598
Oh! A reception committee.

505
00:55:29,016 --> 00:55:30,183
How nice.

506
00:55:30,516 --> 00:55:31,808
So, how did it go?

507
00:55:32,724 --> 00:55:34,849
A very rewarding trip.

508
00:55:34,849 --> 00:55:36,891
The Krassner death at Freiburn

509
00:55:36,891 --> 00:55:40,516
was a genuine accident witnessed
by many people.

510
00:55:40,933 --> 00:55:44,059
At Gladbeck, I met a young
housewife

511
00:55:44,059 --> 00:55:48,434
who was not exactly heart broken
by the death of her old husband.

512
00:55:48,809 --> 00:55:52,642
And at Prozheim they slammed
the door in my face.

513
00:55:52,892 --> 00:55:55,892
That's the way it will probably be
with most of these people.

514
00:55:55,892 --> 00:55:58,643
- I know, come, let's get a coffee.
- Yes, please.

515
00:56:05,768 --> 00:56:07,393
Excuse me, Mr. Lieberman?

516
00:56:08,601 --> 00:56:10,143
My name is David Bennett.

517
00:56:10,143 --> 00:56:12,936
I think you know a friend of mine,
Barry Kohler.

518
00:56:13,686 --> 00:56:17,769
- Are you the boy who's been calling?
- What news of Mr. Kohler?

519
00:56:18,019 --> 00:56:18,852
None.

520
00:56:21,436 --> 00:56:24,269
- I know he was working with you.
- That's not correct.

521
00:56:24,894 --> 00:56:27,478
- Well, he was in contact with you.
- How do you know that?

522
00:56:27,687 --> 00:56:29,978
- From letters we received.
- We?

523
00:56:31,145 --> 00:56:32,937
The Young Jewish Defenders.

524
00:56:32,937 --> 00:56:36,937
They're a bunch of fanatics.
Kohler told me he worked alone.

525
00:56:36,937 --> 00:56:38,728
Yes, and he did, thanks to you.

526
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:42,021
After he read all your books,
he decided to change his methods.

527
00:56:43,229 --> 00:56:46,104
I did not send your friend to Paraguay.

528
00:56:46,688 --> 00:56:48,271
He sent me these.

529
00:56:49,146 --> 00:56:51,813
To prove that he wasn't off
on some wild goose-chase.

530
00:56:52,604 --> 00:56:55,355
He couldn't identify these three
young guys, so I traced them.

531
00:56:55,355 --> 00:56:59,022
This is Kleist, Hessen,
this is Schwimmer,

532
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:02,730
members of a neo-Nazi organization
in Paraguay.

533
00:57:03,105 --> 00:57:05,480
This has nothing to do with me.

534
00:57:06,189 --> 00:57:08,815
Does Barry Kohler's life have
anything to do with you?

535
00:57:08,815 --> 00:57:12,065
- You have no right to talk that way.
- Is Barry Kohler still alive?

536
00:57:12,065 --> 00:57:15,481
- How do I know?
- Mr. Lieberman, Barry is dead.

537
00:57:16,148 --> 00:57:17,273
You know that.

538
00:57:17,815 --> 00:57:20,148
And I know that.
And that's why I'm here.

539
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,357
To pick up where he left off.

540
00:57:22,649 --> 00:57:23,774
That means with you.

541
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:25,774
I work alone.

542
00:57:26,107 --> 00:57:28,232
Im' not asking you for a job,

543
00:57:28,482 --> 00:57:30,441
I simply want some information
from you.

544
00:57:30,441 --> 00:57:32,232
I can't help you.

545
00:57:32,774 --> 00:57:35,192
I won't leave you until
you talk to me.

546
00:57:35,192 --> 00:57:37,275
I'm going to plant myself
on your doostep,

547
00:57:37,275 --> 00:57:39,442
and I'll be waiting for you there
every morning.

548
00:57:39,733 --> 00:57:42,692
You're stuck with me, until you
give me the information that I need.

549
00:57:43,525 --> 00:57:44,358
Ezra,

550
00:57:44,817 --> 00:57:48,025
I got another envelope of clippings
from Beynon.

551
00:57:48,317 --> 00:57:49,818
A big one.

552
00:57:53,609 --> 00:57:55,401
All right, young man.

553
00:57:56,318 --> 00:57:57,401
We'll talk.

554
00:58:50,405 --> 00:58:51,363
Good morning.

555
00:58:51,822 --> 00:58:54,197
I'm looking for the village of Storein.

556
00:58:55,322 --> 00:58:56,947
You're going the wrong way.

557
00:58:57,197 --> 00:59:00,948
Turn around and take the south road
for about sixteen kilometres,

558
00:59:01,406 --> 00:59:03,114
then bear right, you can't miss it.

559
00:59:03,489 --> 00:59:06,073
- Thanks.
- What are you doing in these parts?

560
00:59:07,073 --> 00:59:09,323
- What?
- You are not Swedish.

561
00:59:13,615 --> 00:59:16,365
I come from Don'tmund originally,
but,

562
00:59:17,407 --> 00:59:19,449
I live in Stockholm now.

563
00:59:21,615 --> 00:59:24,282
I have spent some time in Germany
myself.

564
00:59:27,658 --> 00:59:31,075
Come now, Mundt!
What's happened to your memory?

565
00:59:31,408 --> 00:59:34,575
My God!
Major Hartung!

566
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:39,325
<i>I knew it was you!</i>

567
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:42,659
<i>Can't I believe it! What in the world</i>
<i>are you doing up here?</i>

568
00:59:43,992 --> 00:59:46,909
Well, it's no great story,
my sister was married to a Swede.

569
00:59:47,492 --> 00:59:50,867
And after I escaped from the
internment camp, I hid out with them.

570
00:59:51,201 --> 00:59:54,784
I am Lars Lofquist now, Inspector
of the Power Company.

571
00:59:54,784 --> 00:59:55,910
And now what about you?

572
00:59:56,285 --> 01:00:00,160
I came up here on a job, for
the Comrades Organization.

573
01:00:00,827 --> 01:00:01,993
In Sweden?

574
01:00:02,785 --> 01:00:04,160
My God, what's going on?

575
01:00:05,243 --> 01:00:07,535
Can you tell me or would it
violate orders?

576
01:00:07,535 --> 01:00:09,828
What the hell with orders,
I'm sick of orders.

577
01:00:16,578 --> 01:00:19,744
I'm up here in Storein to kill
a school-teacher, on Saturday.

578
01:00:19,994 --> 01:00:23,203
But don't ask me why, I cannot
make head or tail of it.

579
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:26,287
Who is this teacher?
Lundberg? Olafsson?

580
01:00:27,579 --> 01:00:28,662
Lundberg.

581
01:00:30,287 --> 01:00:31,870
But I don't know what he looks like.

582
01:00:32,037 --> 01:00:35,954
No doubt, he's probably a harmless
old man, it doesn't make any sense!

583
01:00:35,954 --> 01:00:37,663
It makes sense to your superiors

584
01:00:38,246 --> 01:00:40,246
or they wouldn't have given you
the assignment.

585
01:00:40,455 --> 01:00:42,038
An order is an order.

586
01:00:43,038 --> 01:00:46,246
Good God, man! You are
an officer of the S. S!

587
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:48,163
Have you forgotten?

588
01:00:48,830 --> 01:00:50,663
My honour is loyalty.

589
01:00:50,996 --> 01:00:53,872
Those words were supposed
to be engraved on your soul.

590
01:00:56,997 --> 01:00:58,289
I know Lundberg.

591
01:00:58,622 --> 01:01:00,164
I will point him out to you.

592
01:01:07,665 --> 01:01:09,082
It isn't Lundberg.

593
01:01:24,583 --> 01:01:27,416
And it doesn't have to be Saturday.

594
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:39,709
No one would have wanted
to kill Jack.

595
01:01:40,709 --> 01:01:42,584
The man was beloved.

596
01:01:43,459 --> 01:01:47,084
If you had seen the wreaths
his students sent...

597
01:01:48,668 --> 01:01:51,918
I have only one or two more
questions to ask.

598
01:01:52,751 --> 01:01:57,085
Did your husband belong
to any international group?

599
01:02:00,126 --> 01:02:02,252
He was in the American Legion.

600
01:02:02,919 --> 01:02:04,086
Rotary.

601
01:02:05,211 --> 01:02:07,294
I guess that's international.

602
01:02:07,961 --> 01:02:10,877
The Legion sent a Colour Guard
to the funeral.

603
01:02:11,336 --> 01:02:14,169
The coffin was drapped
in the American flag.

604
01:02:18,545 --> 01:02:20,170
What are you doing out of bed?

605
01:02:20,545 --> 01:02:23,212
I just came to get a glass
of grapefruit juice.

606
01:02:25,087 --> 01:02:29,545
He's got the flu, also I thought he could
stay home a few days because of it.

607
01:02:30,546 --> 01:02:32,296
This is Jack Curry Jr.

608
01:02:33,379 --> 01:02:35,629
Just Jack Curry, now.

609
01:02:36,379 --> 01:02:39,713
Jack, you bite your tongue.
This is Mr. Lieberman.

610
01:02:39,838 --> 01:02:42,963
A famous man from Vienna
in Austria.

611
01:02:43,129 --> 01:02:45,880
- What's he famous for?
- This is fantastic!

612
01:02:47,172 --> 01:02:49,464
You know you have a double.

613
01:02:50,214 --> 01:02:54,755
A boy who lives in Gladbeck
in Germany, exactly like you.

614
01:02:55,047 --> 01:02:56,422
Exactly like me?

615
01:02:56,630 --> 01:02:58,673
I never saw anything like it.

616
01:02:59,465 --> 01:03:01,798
Two twin brothers could not
be more the same.

617
01:03:02,256 --> 01:03:05,465
Jack, you go up to bed, and
I'll bring you the juice.

618
01:03:05,923 --> 01:03:08,256
- I want to find out about...
- You do what I tell you!

619
01:03:08,256 --> 01:03:11,090
When you start paying the doctor bills,
then you can hang around

620
01:03:11,090 --> 01:03:13,549
and get sick all you want, now just
say goodbye and go.

621
01:03:14,132 --> 01:03:16,257
Jesus Christ!
Goodbye.

622
01:03:17,174 --> 01:03:18,882
You watch your mouth, young man!

623
01:03:21,007 --> 01:03:22,424
It's amazing!

624
01:03:22,424 --> 01:03:25,591
I thought he was this young boy
from Germany

625
01:03:25,591 --> 01:03:27,217
come to visit you.

626
01:03:27,217 --> 01:03:30,300
Even the voice, the look in the eyes.
Exactly.

627
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:33,842
Look, I don't want to be rude, but as
you can see, I got a lot of things to do.

628
01:03:36,675 --> 01:03:40,134
Look, I'm sure that nobody shot
Big Jack on purpose.

629
01:03:40,593 --> 01:03:42,801
It was a horrible accident.

630
01:03:42,801 --> 01:03:43,968
If you'll excuse me.

631
01:03:54,719 --> 01:03:56,510
Hello, is this the Harrington residence?

632
01:03:56,510 --> 01:03:58,635
Yes, this is the Harrington residence.

633
01:03:59,594 --> 01:04:01,385
Can I talk to your mother, please?

634
01:04:01,677 --> 01:04:03,427
Well, you could, but you can't.

635
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,635
This will only take a moment,
I promise you.

636
01:04:05,802 --> 01:04:07,803
My mother isn't receiving today.

637
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:10,761
Well, perhaps if you told her that I...

638
01:04:10,761 --> 01:04:13,178
Don't you understand English,
you ass?

639
01:04:13,803 --> 01:04:15,386
We are not at home.

640
01:04:21,636 --> 01:04:23,762
Wilcox had two married daughters.

641
01:04:25,054 --> 01:04:26,387
No, no sons.

642
01:04:26,471 --> 01:04:29,596
The Harringstons, do they have
any children?

643
01:04:31,471 --> 01:04:32,762
What did the boy look like?

644
01:04:32,762 --> 01:04:37,263
Sort of pale, he had straight
dark hair, very dark,

645
01:04:37,888 --> 01:04:38,680
blue eyes.

646
01:04:41,388 --> 01:04:42,972
Yeah, yeah, I'm listening.

647
01:04:43,805 --> 01:04:46,222
Why do you want to know about
the kids all of a sudden?

648
01:04:46,222 --> 01:04:47,763
Listen, Mr. Bennett,

649
01:04:48,388 --> 01:04:52,473
if you want to ask the questions,
you pay for the phone call.

650
01:04:54,723 --> 01:04:55,473
No,

651
01:04:56,473 --> 01:04:57,389
nothing.

652
01:04:58,348 --> 01:05:00,764
No, I haven't found a link.

653
01:05:02,014 --> 01:05:04,390
No, I'm in the dark.

654
01:05:04,682 --> 01:05:06,932
Yeah, I'll call you tomorrow,
I promise.

655
01:05:16,099 --> 01:05:16,974
<i>Coming.</i>

656
01:05:20,308 --> 01:05:22,475
I have to speak to you,
Mr. Lieberman.

657
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:26,266
Well, come in. I was just coming
to see you.

658
01:05:27,975 --> 01:05:31,100
- Sit down.
- No, I can't stay long.

659
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:33,142
Jack Jr. Doesn't know
where I've gone.

660
01:05:35,142 --> 01:05:36,392
Mr. Lieberman,

661
01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:40,392
my son is the only thing I've got.

662
01:05:41,392 --> 01:05:45,017
- You can't take him away from me.
- I have no intention of...

663
01:05:45,017 --> 01:05:47,852
When you spoke about that boy
in Germany, I got worried.

664
01:05:48,352 --> 01:05:51,852
The lady who gave Jack Jr. To us,
made us swear never to tell anyone.

665
01:05:52,768 --> 01:05:57,560
- Your son's adopted?
- It's just that... she was a German lady.

666
01:05:58,102 --> 01:05:59,893
She was very nice, really.

667
01:06:00,394 --> 01:06:02,728
I was amazed when I read
in the papers,

668
01:06:02,728 --> 01:06:04,644
about all the things you said she did.

669
01:06:06,811 --> 01:06:08,269
Frieda Maloney.

670
01:06:08,811 --> 01:06:10,019
Oh, God!

671
01:06:10,894 --> 01:06:12,853
I knew I should never have come here.

672
01:06:29,813 --> 01:06:31,980
Will you give me your word
that you do not have

673
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:33,813
any recording device
in your briefcase?

674
01:06:38,063 --> 01:06:38,938
Thank you.

675
01:06:51,981 --> 01:06:53,647
Do you have the depositions?

676
01:06:53,939 --> 01:06:55,147
I have brought one.

677
01:06:57,273 --> 01:07:00,190
The agreement was that you
would provide an advance look

678
01:07:00,190 --> 01:07:02,190
at all the testimonies against
my client.

679
01:07:02,732 --> 01:07:06,523
With particular regard to any scars,
deformities, or disabilities,

680
01:07:06,523 --> 01:07:07,982
suffered by the witnessses.

681
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:10,274
Here. The deposition is brought
in good faith.

682
01:07:11,149 --> 01:07:15,983
Two others will come if the interview
should prove satisfactory.

683
01:07:16,316 --> 01:07:18,358
You realise how unjust all this is.

684
01:07:19,691 --> 01:07:23,066
Mrs. Maloney has been married
to an American citizen for 27 years.

685
01:07:24,066 --> 01:07:27,025
She has two children,
one grandchild.

686
01:07:36,525 --> 01:07:37,942
I suppose this can be...

687
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:40,360
corroborated?

688
01:07:41,735 --> 01:07:45,610
By the mother of the child and
three other surviving witnesses.

689
01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:02,277
You will keep the interview brief.

690
01:08:04,152 --> 01:08:06,945
You will discuss only my client's
activities in America

691
01:08:06,945 --> 01:08:09,112
between 1964 and '67.

692
01:08:11,278 --> 01:08:14,278
You will ask nothing about
the charges against her

693
01:08:14,278 --> 01:08:17,653
or about any event that ocurred
during, or directly after the war.

694
01:08:18,737 --> 01:08:25,404
One question of that nature and I will
immediately terminate the interview.

695
01:09:30,826 --> 01:09:31,951
So.

696
01:09:33,368 --> 01:09:36,784
I am to speak to you about my work
with the adoption agency.

697
01:09:36,784 --> 01:09:39,076
- That is correct.
- I don't mind.

698
01:09:40,326 --> 01:09:43,034
What I did may have been
slightly illegal, but,

699
01:09:43,493 --> 01:09:47,369
I brought happiness to so many people
and that's was important, huh?

700
01:09:48,369 --> 01:09:50,035
Now tell me, if you will,

701
01:09:50,410 --> 01:09:53,285
how you came to work
for this agency?

702
01:09:57,535 --> 01:10:01,453
In the spring of 1963 I was contacted
by someone

703
01:10:01,453 --> 01:10:03,786
I knew in the Comrades
Organization.

704
01:10:03,953 --> 01:10:04,828
Who?

705
01:10:05,036 --> 01:10:06,995
Frau Maloney will not answer that.

706
01:10:08,745 --> 01:10:10,536
They helped me after the war

707
01:10:10,536 --> 01:10:12,120
and wanted me to return the favour

708
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:14,829
by getting a job in an adoption agency.

709
01:10:15,871 --> 01:10:17,287
Did they say why?

710
01:10:17,579 --> 01:10:19,787
If you let me finish,
you'll find out.

711
01:10:23,329 --> 01:10:25,871
The Rush-Gaddis agency hired me.

712
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:29,955
The Comrades Organization was
interested in rejects.

713
01:10:30,288 --> 01:10:33,830
Couples who had been denied children,
because the husband was too old.

714
01:10:34,622 --> 01:10:37,205
I was to go through the files
looking for applications,

715
01:10:37,205 --> 01:10:40,748
specifically those of families
with Nordic-Christian backgrounds,

716
01:10:41,456 --> 01:10:45,289
in which the husband was born
between 1910 and 1914

717
01:10:45,289 --> 01:10:49,206
and the wife between 1933 and 1937.

718
01:10:50,414 --> 01:10:53,623
The husband had to have a job
in something like civil service

719
01:10:54,081 --> 01:10:57,457
and both spouses had to be
in perfect physical health.

720
01:10:57,707 --> 01:11:00,624
Did they say why they wanted
all this?

721
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:02,832
That information is not relevant.

722
01:11:02,832 --> 01:11:06,124
I was expected to obey my orders,
not to question them.

723
01:11:07,415 --> 01:11:10,416
This I did.
As I always had.

724
01:11:11,791 --> 01:11:14,791
About a year after that
I was ordered to contact

725
01:11:14,791 --> 01:11:19,041
several of the applicants and
offer them a healthy white baby boy,

726
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:21,541
complete with New York State
adoption papers.

727
01:11:22,041 --> 01:11:23,917
They were to pay me
five hundred dollars

728
01:11:24,584 --> 01:11:27,042
and after their medical certificates
had been cleared,

729
01:11:27,042 --> 01:11:28,792
they would receive the babies.

730
01:11:29,292 --> 01:11:32,834
We would meet at a motel
near Kennedy Airport,

731
01:11:33,667 --> 01:11:35,334
that used to be Idelwild.

732
01:11:36,459 --> 01:11:38,293
The babies were delivered to me

733
01:11:38,293 --> 01:11:41,085
usually by stewardesses
with Varig Airlines.

734
01:11:41,335 --> 01:11:42,210
Varig?

735
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:46,168
Did the babies all come from Brazil?

736
01:11:47,418 --> 01:11:49,918
- Is that important to you?
- No.

737
01:11:51,503 --> 01:11:53,128
What did they look like?

738
01:11:53,461 --> 01:11:55,794
They were all beautiful little boys,

739
01:11:56,003 --> 01:11:59,669
black hair, piercing blue eyes.

740
01:12:00,836 --> 01:12:04,920
If you're looking for a long lost Jewish
grandson, he was not among them.

741
01:12:08,129 --> 01:12:10,545
How many couples did you give
the babies to?

742
01:12:11,545 --> 01:12:12,837
About twenty.

743
01:12:12,837 --> 01:12:14,212
Only Americans?

744
01:12:14,879 --> 01:12:17,129
- Some were Canadian.
- No Europeans?

745
01:12:17,129 --> 01:12:17,879
No.

746
01:12:18,295 --> 01:12:21,213
Can you remember a Curry family?

747
01:12:21,921 --> 01:12:23,880
- Curry? Yes.
- Who else?

748
01:12:25,171 --> 01:12:26,130
Wheelock.

749
01:12:26,963 --> 01:12:28,213
Henry Wheelock.

750
01:12:29,588 --> 01:12:31,588
He gave me my dog Schatzie.

751
01:12:32,630 --> 01:12:34,422
Beautiful Doberman.

752
01:12:34,881 --> 01:12:37,464
It was only ten weeks old
when I got him.

753
01:12:38,214 --> 01:12:40,256
Where is Wheelock from?

754
01:12:41,006 --> 01:12:42,756
New Providence, Pennsylvania.

755
01:12:43,797 --> 01:12:46,422
And how long after the Currys,

756
01:12:46,422 --> 01:12:48,507
did the Wheelocks get their baby?

757
01:12:48,507 --> 01:12:51,132
That's fourteen years ago,
I don't remember.

758
01:12:54,132 --> 01:12:57,715
And what has Josef Mengele
to do with all this?

759
01:12:57,882 --> 01:12:59,257
We won't answer that.

760
01:12:59,423 --> 01:13:01,424
It was all a trick, wasn't it?

761
01:13:02,424 --> 01:13:04,299
I know nothing of Mengele,

762
01:13:05,091 --> 01:13:07,091
but you'll link me with him,
won't you?

763
01:13:07,091 --> 01:13:09,716
You want your pound of flesh,
you don't care how yuo get it!

764
01:13:10,049 --> 01:13:12,799
Thirty years!
The world has forgotten!

765
01:13:13,174 --> 01:13:14,424
Nobody cares!

766
01:13:14,925 --> 01:13:17,467
And you persist!
And persist!

767
01:13:17,467 --> 01:13:19,134
Now, why don't you get off my back?

768
01:13:22,550 --> 01:13:26,592
- One more minor question.
- I'll say nothing to you.

769
01:13:27,134 --> 01:13:28,259
As you wish.

770
01:13:31,218 --> 01:13:34,093
This interview has not gone by any
means to my satisfaction

771
01:13:34,093 --> 01:13:38,593
I will therefore withold the other two
depositions we talked about.

772
01:13:38,593 --> 01:13:41,051
You lying Jewish schwein!

773
01:13:42,510 --> 01:13:44,761
You're not a guard now, Madame!

774
01:13:46,594 --> 01:13:48,052
You are a prisoner!

775
01:13:49,344 --> 01:13:52,927
I may leave here empty-handed,

776
01:13:54,427 --> 01:13:55,511
but you

777
01:13:56,386 --> 01:13:59,762
are not going anywhere.

778
01:14:04,970 --> 01:14:07,553
I think Frau Maloney could answer
one more question.

779
01:14:12,513 --> 01:14:16,471
When is your dog's birthday?

780
01:14:18,721 --> 01:14:22,054
You are an insane old man
after all, aren't you?

781
01:14:22,804 --> 01:14:27,305
Schatzie's birthday? It was
December eleventh.

782
01:14:31,014 --> 01:14:32,930
<i>Have a safe trip, David.</i>

783
01:14:33,555 --> 01:14:34,555
Why?

784
01:14:35,014 --> 01:14:35,930
<i>Bye, bye.</i>

785
01:14:36,264 --> 01:14:37,389
...Mengele?

786
01:14:39,806 --> 01:14:42,765
That was David, he's off to New
York for his sister's wedding,

787
01:14:42,765 --> 01:14:44,515
but he'll be back in a week.

788
01:14:46,848 --> 01:14:47,931
Mengele...

789
01:14:49,806 --> 01:14:51,181
gives babies,

790
01:14:52,056 --> 01:14:55,932
fourteen years later he kills
the fathers,

791
01:14:56,182 --> 01:14:59,932
he kills Doring, Harrington,
Curry.

792
01:14:59,932 --> 01:15:03,057
And the Currys got their baby
four weeks apart

793
01:15:03,057 --> 01:15:06,266
and the fathers were killed four
weeks apart.

794
01:15:09,725 --> 01:15:10,808
Wheelock.

795
01:15:12,433 --> 01:15:16,267
Malone's dog was born December
eleventh, ten weeks.

796
01:15:16,642 --> 01:15:20,392
I've already worked it out,
February the twentieth.

797
01:15:21,559 --> 01:15:24,476
That's only four days from now!

798
01:15:26,893 --> 01:15:29,768
Wheelock, New Providence,
Pennsylvania.

799
01:15:30,851 --> 01:15:33,351
How can I call Wheelock and tell him

800
01:15:33,351 --> 01:15:36,810
he's going to be killed by the people
who gave him his baby?

801
01:15:37,352 --> 01:15:40,810
That Josef Mengele has already killed
the fathers of at least

802
01:15:41,185 --> 01:15:43,644
two other boys who happen
to be twins?

803
01:15:45,185 --> 01:15:48,519
Who would believe such
a preposterous story?

804
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:50,149
Herr Doktor, how kind of you to come.

805
01:16:50,565 --> 01:16:52,024
A pleasure to be here.

806
01:16:52,899 --> 01:16:56,774
- Can this be little Elsa?
- Yes! You remember!

807
01:17:00,566 --> 01:17:05,983
Last time I saw you were that
high. You had whooping cough.

808
01:17:07,191 --> 01:17:08,108
No, no.

809
01:17:10,233 --> 01:17:12,775
I'm going to dance with
your beautiful daughter.

810
01:17:46,236 --> 01:17:47,611
Good evening, how are you?

811
01:17:50,111 --> 01:17:52,653
May I present to you
my wife Gertrud?

812
01:17:53,153 --> 01:17:56,779
- My love, Herr Mengele.
- It's such an honour meeting you.

813
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:59,695
We're here on a little
second honey-moon.

814
01:18:04,112 --> 01:18:07,904
You're supposed to be in Krintianstad,
getting ready to kill Oscarsson.

815
01:18:08,820 --> 01:18:10,030
Traitor!

816
01:18:25,572 --> 01:18:26,364
No!

817
01:18:31,489 --> 01:18:33,197
He betrayed me!

818
01:18:34,031 --> 01:18:35,781
He betrayed you!

819
01:18:35,781 --> 01:18:38,573
He betrayed the Aryan race!

820
01:18:40,573 --> 01:18:41,823
Get a doctor!

821
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:44,615
I am a doctor, idiot.

822
01:18:44,740 --> 01:18:46,990
Don't you come near him!

823
01:18:47,323 --> 01:18:49,865
Shut up, you ugly bitch!

824
01:18:59,491 --> 01:19:03,241
- I thought you knew...
- Hold still, hold still.

825
01:19:04,199 --> 01:19:05,409
<i>Doktor Mengele.</i>

826
01:19:08,575 --> 01:19:11,575
Could I call you away from surgery
for one moment?

827
01:19:14,450 --> 01:19:15,700
If you'll excuse me.

828
01:19:20,493 --> 01:19:24,410
And why was I not told that,
that man was called back?

829
01:19:24,410 --> 01:19:26,868
- All the men have been recalled.
- Recalled?

830
01:19:27,701 --> 01:19:30,368
They should all be back here
by the end of the week.

831
01:19:31,868 --> 01:19:33,243
But why?

832
01:19:33,911 --> 01:19:34,994
What has happened?

833
01:19:35,536 --> 01:19:39,202
Lieberman visited Frieda Maloney
in prison.

834
01:19:40,536 --> 01:19:42,119
Lieberman again?

835
01:19:42,119 --> 01:19:46,244
Will I be plagued to my dying day
by that infernal Jew?

836
01:19:46,244 --> 01:19:48,578
Maloney told him about the adoptions.

837
01:19:50,953 --> 01:19:53,703
Well, that's not catastrophic,
Seibert.

838
01:19:54,745 --> 01:19:58,037
She only knows about America,
work can still continue in Europe.

839
01:19:58,537 --> 01:20:01,663
The organization doesn't share
your optimism, Herr Doktor.

840
01:20:01,663 --> 01:20:04,996
But all Lieberman has are a few
paltry shreds of information

841
01:20:05,163 --> 01:20:07,204
that he could not possibly
piece together.

842
01:20:07,913 --> 01:20:10,913
Eighteen of your subjects
have died.

843
01:20:11,163 --> 01:20:14,454
That means according to your
figures that we can be sure of one,

844
01:20:14,454 --> 01:20:16,164
perhaps even two successes.

845
01:20:16,955 --> 01:20:18,914
And if my calculations are wrong?

846
01:20:18,914 --> 01:20:21,705
There's only one chance in twenty,
or thirty.

847
01:20:22,164 --> 01:20:25,122
No, Seibert, the men must
go back.

848
01:20:25,664 --> 01:20:28,414
They can't, the operation
has been terminated.

849
01:20:31,873 --> 01:20:33,415
Terminated?

850
01:20:34,873 --> 01:20:36,373
By whose authority?

851
01:20:40,123 --> 01:20:42,873
General Rausch and the Colonels.

852
01:20:51,624 --> 01:20:52,874
I told you.

853
01:20:53,416 --> 01:20:55,124
I told you from the beginning.

854
01:20:55,124 --> 01:20:57,124
Kill him.
Kill him!

855
01:20:57,416 --> 01:20:59,125
It would have been so easy!

856
01:20:59,125 --> 01:21:02,375
It's gone beyond Lieberman,
we don't know who else is involved.

857
01:21:02,375 --> 01:21:04,000
You have betrayed me!

858
01:21:05,042 --> 01:21:09,708
You're all... all a bunch of selfish old
men who've lost your courage.

859
01:21:10,208 --> 01:21:13,584
You only want to bask in the sun
in your old age!

860
01:21:14,043 --> 01:21:18,834
And if your Aryan grandchildren have
to live in a world which is run

861
01:21:18,834 --> 01:21:23,293
by Jews, and Blacks, and Orientals,
and slobs! You could not care less!

862
01:21:24,334 --> 01:21:26,460
Your operation has been cancelled.

863
01:21:27,419 --> 01:21:28,377
No!

864
01:21:28,835 --> 01:21:31,752
Your operation has been cancelled!

865
01:21:33,335 --> 01:21:34,919
Mine continues.

866
01:21:40,295 --> 01:21:42,045
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

867
01:24:17,972 --> 01:24:23,181
This Mengele was sort of a primitive
geneticist in his ons way, wasn't he?

868
01:24:24,347 --> 01:24:27,722
I understand that he experimented
on human beings.

869
01:24:28,432 --> 01:24:29,432
Twins.

870
01:24:30,890 --> 01:24:33,390
Then he was nothing more
than a sadist really.

871
01:24:34,598 --> 01:24:38,265
A sadis with a M.D. And a Ph.D.

872
01:24:39,807 --> 01:24:44,099
Well, some people would say that's
a perfect definition of a scientist.

873
01:24:47,266 --> 01:24:50,724
What exactly do you mean when
you say the boys you saw

874
01:24:50,724 --> 01:24:52,349
were more than twins?

875
01:24:53,308 --> 01:24:55,516
Not only do they look alike,

876
01:24:55,516 --> 01:24:58,517
buy they were also very alike
in personality.

877
01:24:59,642 --> 01:25:01,017
That is unusual.

878
01:25:01,475 --> 01:25:04,475
Studies show that twins who are
separated at birth

879
01:25:04,475 --> 01:25:06,600
develop totally different personalities.

880
01:25:06,725 --> 01:25:10,976
But these twins, or perhaps
I should say triplets

881
01:25:10,976 --> 01:25:13,893
because I believe that
my associate saw another

882
01:25:14,393 --> 01:25:16,810
were like the same people,

883
01:25:17,476 --> 01:25:21,185
but brought up with different
languages.

884
01:25:22,476 --> 01:25:24,436
It's impossible, of course.

885
01:25:25,977 --> 01:25:28,977
Excuse me doctor, but
what is impossible?

886
01:25:33,561 --> 01:25:35,561
What is impossible, doctor?

887
01:25:37,061 --> 01:25:39,395
Mononuclear reproduction.

888
01:25:40,645 --> 01:25:41,728
Doctor.

889
01:25:43,270 --> 01:25:44,395
Cloning.

890
01:25:45,395 --> 01:25:49,228
What if I were to tell you that
I could take a scraping of skin

891
01:25:49,228 --> 01:25:52,813
from you finger and create
another Ezra Lieberman?

892
01:25:54,021 --> 01:25:57,979
I would tell you not to waste
your time, or my finger.

893
01:25:58,771 --> 01:26:00,521
Anyway, that is cloning.

894
01:26:00,771 --> 01:26:02,438
It was first done with plants.

895
01:26:03,104 --> 01:26:05,729
A cutting taken from a plant
and transplanted

896
01:26:05,729 --> 01:26:08,980
grew to be the exact duplicate
of the donor plant.

897
01:26:09,522 --> 01:26:12,980
Now we are doing the same thing
with laboratory animals.

898
01:26:13,939 --> 01:26:17,772
You mean, you can produce
an animal from itself?

899
01:26:18,647 --> 01:26:22,898
We take the unfertilized egg
off an ovulating female

900
01:26:22,898 --> 01:26:25,440
and destroy all of its genes
and chromosomes.

901
01:26:25,981 --> 01:26:29,523
We then implant the nucleus
of the donor cell

902
01:26:29,523 --> 01:26:34,232
which could be taken from a blood
sample, or even a skin scraping.

903
01:26:34,524 --> 01:26:38,149
That cell with its genetic material
intact,

904
01:26:38,482 --> 01:26:42,816
eventually becomes an embryo
and is born as a living creature.

905
01:26:44,357 --> 01:26:45,357
Without parents?

906
01:26:46,649 --> 01:26:50,150
Well, it has no father because
the egg was never fertilized.

907
01:26:50,442 --> 01:26:54,608
No mother, because its genetic code
comes from another being.

908
01:26:55,233 --> 01:26:56,608
Can you follow that?

909
01:26:57,317 --> 01:27:02,151
And this creature, is an exact
duplicate of itself?

910
01:27:03,651 --> 01:27:05,901
Doctor, how can that be?

911
01:27:07,318 --> 01:27:08,318
Come along.

912
01:27:15,234 --> 01:27:18,527
Ous experiments began with
the simplest of animals,

913
01:27:18,527 --> 01:27:19,860
shrimps and frogs.

914
01:27:20,944 --> 01:27:25,694
Animals in which the female's eggs
are fertilized externally.

915
01:27:31,695 --> 01:27:33,611
Then we moved on to mammals.

916
01:27:34,445 --> 01:27:36,695
We tried several laboratoty animals

917
01:27:36,695 --> 01:27:38,986
and found the rabbit
most convenient.

918
01:27:40,195 --> 01:27:43,528
I had to develop instruments
which could accomplig the operation

919
01:27:45,321 --> 01:27:47,654
and a whole micro-injection system

920
01:27:48,112 --> 01:27:49,487
I'll show you how it's done.

921
01:27:52,321 --> 01:27:56,446
Here we are removing the eggs of
white rabbit from the Fallopian tubes.

922
01:27:59,738 --> 01:28:03,322
Now, you see the egg
under a microscope.

923
01:28:03,988 --> 01:28:07,322
I've brought the point of an ordinary
sewing needle into view

924
01:28:07,322 --> 01:28:09,488
to give an idea of the size.

925
01:28:10,155 --> 01:28:11,572
They are that small?

926
01:28:12,072 --> 01:28:14,573
Most mammal eggs are about
that size.

927
01:28:15,448 --> 01:28:17,698
- Including human eggs?
- Yes.

928
01:28:18,364 --> 01:28:22,989
The next step is to destroy
the egg nucleus

929
01:28:22,989 --> 01:28:24,448
with ultraviolet light.

930
01:28:24,739 --> 01:28:27,657
So that none of its genetic
make-up remains.

931
01:28:30,574 --> 01:28:33,532
Now you see an egg from
a white rabbit

932
01:28:33,532 --> 01:28:38,282
ready to be injected with the blood
cell from a black rabbit donor.

933
01:28:39,949 --> 01:28:44,283
With the injection pipette
one of the blood cells is sucked up

934
01:28:44,283 --> 01:28:46,408
and then injected into the egg.

935
01:28:51,325 --> 01:28:55,326
After a few hours the eggs
in culture divide

936
01:28:55,742 --> 01:28:58,409
and are ready to be put back
into the female.

937
01:29:02,784 --> 01:29:04,701
There, they grow into embryos,

938
01:29:04,992 --> 01:29:08,743
which in a month's time
the normal gestation period,

939
01:29:08,952 --> 01:29:10,910
they will become baby rabbits.

940
01:29:12,702 --> 01:29:17,535
In this instance, a black litter,
from a a white mother

941
01:29:17,827 --> 01:29:22,077
and their black colour proves
that they have been cloned

942
01:29:22,285 --> 01:29:24,953
from the blood cell of a black
rabbit.

943
01:29:39,329 --> 01:29:43,495
But, isn't it difficult to get the egg
back into the female?

944
01:29:43,995 --> 01:29:46,037
Transferring the eggs isn't a problem

945
01:29:46,037 --> 01:29:48,370
we do that all the time
with laboratory animals.

946
01:29:49,037 --> 01:29:52,371
The really tricky part is
the micro-surgery.

947
01:29:53,413 --> 01:29:56,496
Getting the donor cell into the egg.

948
01:29:56,913 --> 01:29:59,788
You're lucky if one in ten survives.

949
01:30:00,371 --> 01:30:02,705
This can be done with humans?

950
01:30:02,996 --> 01:30:05,622
If the surgical technique were
precise enough.

951
01:30:05,997 --> 01:30:08,206
- It's monstrous, doctor!
- Why?

952
01:30:08,997 --> 01:30:12,622
Wouldn't you want to live in a world
full of Mozarts and Picassos?

953
01:30:13,664 --> 01:30:15,206
Of course, it's only a dream.

954
01:30:15,414 --> 01:30:20,290
Not only would you have to reproduce
the genetic code of the donor,

955
01:30:20,915 --> 01:30:23,582
but the environmental background
as well.

956
01:30:26,957 --> 01:30:30,498
Is Mengele trying to reproduce
himself?

957
01:30:31,540 --> 01:30:37,333
No, he has brown eyes, and he comes
from a very wealthy family.

958
01:30:38,083 --> 01:30:42,874
Let's examine the family background
of the donor.

959
01:30:47,167 --> 01:30:49,292
The father is sixty-five years old.

960
01:30:49,709 --> 01:30:51,125
Civil servant.

961
01:30:54,875 --> 01:30:56,500
The mother is forty-two, you say?

962
01:30:59,834 --> 01:31:01,501
She dotes on the child.

963
01:31:04,626 --> 01:31:05,710
Spoils.

964
01:31:07,751 --> 01:31:09,085
The boy is...

965
01:31:11,168 --> 01:31:12,293
pale...

966
01:31:15,794 --> 01:31:16,836
dark hair...

967
01:31:19,502 --> 01:31:20,752
blue eyes.

968
01:31:22,836 --> 01:31:24,211
Spoilt.

969
01:31:30,795 --> 01:31:31,920
Right?

970
01:31:33,420 --> 01:31:38,795
Now, Mengele would certainly know
every social and environmental detail

971
01:31:38,795 --> 01:31:40,712
would have to be reproduced.

972
01:31:41,545 --> 01:31:45,296
Thus, if the parents were divorced
when the boy was ten,

973
01:31:45,546 --> 01:31:47,504
this would have to be arranged.

974
01:31:48,254 --> 01:31:49,338
Doctor Bruckner,

975
01:31:51,588 --> 01:31:53,546
the one who is cloned,

976
01:31:55,213 --> 01:31:56,463
the donor,

977
01:31:56,672 --> 01:31:59,464
- he has to be alive, doesn't he?
- Not necessarily.

978
01:31:59,922 --> 01:32:04,380
Individual cells taken from a donor
can be preserved indefinitely.

979
01:32:05,172 --> 01:32:09,089
With a sample of Mozart's blood
and the women,

980
01:32:09,339 --> 01:32:11,715
someone with the skill
and the equipment,

981
01:32:11,715 --> 01:32:14,131
could breed a few hundred
baby Mozarts.

982
01:32:21,798 --> 01:32:22,965
My God.

983
01:32:23,756 --> 01:32:25,507
If it's really been done,

984
01:32:27,007 --> 01:32:29,382
what I'd give to see one
of those boys.

985
01:32:34,549 --> 01:32:35,674
Herr Lieberman!

986
01:32:42,425 --> 01:32:43,633
Herr Lieberman.

987
01:32:46,633 --> 01:32:48,967
Not Mozart, doctor.

988
01:32:50,883 --> 01:32:52,175
Not Picasso.

989
01:32:53,759 --> 01:32:56,426
Not a genius who would enrich
the world,

990
01:32:58,843 --> 01:33:00,718
but a lonely little boy

991
01:33:01,509 --> 01:33:03,509
with a domineering father,

992
01:33:04,468 --> 01:33:06,301
a customs officer

993
01:33:06,551 --> 01:33:09,510
who was fifty-two when
he was born.

994
01:33:11,094 --> 01:33:12,219
And...

995
01:33:12,677 --> 01:33:15,385
an affectionate doting mother

996
01:33:16,802 --> 01:33:19,135
who was twenty-nine.

997
01:33:20,845 --> 01:33:23,845
The father died at sixty-five

998
01:33:24,928 --> 01:33:27,970
when the boy was nearly fourteen.

999
01:33:35,887 --> 01:33:37,596
Adolf Hitler.

1000
01:34:44,183 --> 01:34:45,434
Colonel Seibert.

1001
01:37:39,529 --> 01:37:40,571
You Lieberman?

1002
01:37:44,363 --> 01:37:45,071
<i>Ja.</i>

1003
01:37:45,488 --> 01:37:46,529
Come in.

1004
01:37:59,905 --> 01:38:01,072
Okay, boys.

1005
01:38:02,948 --> 01:38:04,406
Beautiful dogs.

1006
01:38:04,531 --> 01:38:07,906
Tear the throat out of anyone
who even looks cross-eyed at me.

1007
01:38:09,740 --> 01:38:13,406
I guess you can see why I didn't
exactly wet my pants

1008
01:38:13,406 --> 01:38:15,574
when you said someone
was out to get me.

1009
01:38:15,991 --> 01:38:16,991
Yeah.

1010
01:38:17,449 --> 01:38:18,741
Take off your coat.

1011
01:38:55,368 --> 01:38:56,659
Very impressive.

1012
01:38:57,994 --> 01:38:58,994
Yeah.

1013
01:39:05,744 --> 01:39:07,702
My son took those pictures.

1014
01:39:08,119 --> 01:39:09,410
Very good.

1015
01:39:10,785 --> 01:39:12,036
Very good.

1016
01:39:12,870 --> 01:39:15,078
A little artsy-fartsy, if you ask me.

1017
01:39:15,745 --> 01:39:19,078
- Is your son at home now?
- No, he's in school.

1018
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:25,371
And Mrs. Wheelock,
is she at home?

1019
01:39:25,579 --> 01:39:26,787
She's still at work.

1020
01:39:27,162 --> 01:39:30,829
So you're the guy who got that
Nazi Eichmann?

1021
01:39:34,204 --> 01:39:35,704
I located him.

1022
01:39:36,496 --> 01:39:39,413
It was the Israelis who did
the actual kidnapping.

1023
01:39:39,622 --> 01:39:40,955
How much did you get for that?

1024
01:39:41,955 --> 01:39:42,997
Nothing.

1025
01:39:44,038 --> 01:39:47,538
I did it for the satisfaction,
I hate all Nazis.

1026
01:39:48,538 --> 01:39:50,372
I don't know about the Nazis.

1027
01:39:51,497 --> 01:39:53,080
The Niggers we got to worry about.

1028
01:39:54,789 --> 01:39:57,039
Hey, why are these Nazis after me?

1029
01:39:57,581 --> 01:39:58,623
Well...

1030
01:40:01,539 --> 01:40:03,206
You know, I...

1031
01:40:03,664 --> 01:40:04,914
I find it very hard to talk.

1032
01:40:04,914 --> 01:40:06,956
Don't worry about them,
they won't bother you

1033
01:40:07,832 --> 01:40:09,082
unless you bother me.

1034
01:40:09,249 --> 01:40:12,540
I was attacked by... by a dog
when I was a child,

1035
01:40:12,832 --> 01:40:14,082
a German shepherd,

1036
01:40:15,082 --> 01:40:18,582
and I still feel uncomfortable
with a dog in the room.

1037
01:40:18,915 --> 01:40:21,791
Jesus! You're like my neighbour
Wally.

1038
01:40:21,791 --> 01:40:23,833
I mean, he won't even walk up
the driveway

1039
01:40:23,833 --> 01:40:25,666
unless the dogs are lockep up.

1040
01:40:25,666 --> 01:40:26,666
Okay.

1041
01:40:32,291 --> 01:40:33,666
Come on, boys, in you go.

1042
01:40:38,959 --> 01:40:41,417
There's no other way that
they can come in?

1043
01:40:41,876 --> 01:40:42,876
No.

1044
01:40:43,334 --> 01:40:44,334
Thank you.

1045
01:40:46,459 --> 01:40:48,209
I feel much better.

1046
01:40:55,668 --> 01:40:56,835
Hey!

1047
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:57,752
Put your hands up.

1048
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:00,627
What the hell are you up to, anyway?

1049
01:41:01,293 --> 01:41:03,085
Is there a basement in this house?

1050
01:41:04,461 --> 01:41:05,461
Yeah.

1051
01:41:05,586 --> 01:41:06,586
Take me to it.

1052
01:41:16,794 --> 01:41:18,712
Do you have any pictures
of your son?

1053
01:41:19,587 --> 01:41:21,545
There's an album on the table.

1054
01:41:22,004 --> 01:41:23,379
What do you want them for?

1055
01:41:23,587 --> 01:41:25,004
Please, do not worry.

1056
01:41:25,670 --> 01:41:28,379
I am very anxious to see him
and talk to him.

1057
01:41:28,379 --> 01:41:31,129
I am the doctor who delivered him.

1058
01:41:34,713 --> 01:41:35,963
Open the door.

1059
01:41:44,505 --> 01:41:46,714
Go down the stairs, Mr. Wheelock.

1060
01:42:07,465 --> 01:42:11,257
Now, listen, I don't give a doodily-shit
about Jews or Nazis.

1061
01:42:11,882 --> 01:42:13,048
Good.

1062
01:42:46,343 --> 01:42:48,843
Tell me, please, which way
to Quarryville?

1063
01:42:49,385 --> 01:42:51,385
Turn left at the end of the exit,

1064
01:42:51,385 --> 01:42:54,801
it's beyond Thirty, take a left, it'll take
you straight into Quarryville.

1065
01:42:55,218 --> 01:42:56,219
Thank you.

1066
01:43:05,177 --> 01:43:06,677
Quiet, damn you!

1067
01:43:14,887 --> 01:43:17,428
Bobby, dear, dear, boy.

1068
01:45:01,644 --> 01:45:02,895
Mr. Wheelock.

1069
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:14,020
Mr. Wheelock.

1070
01:45:31,188 --> 01:45:32,480
Mr. Wheelock!

1071
01:45:52,231 --> 01:45:53,356
Mister...

1072
01:45:57,606 --> 01:45:58,857
You.

1073
01:45:59,690 --> 01:46:01,440
Herr Lieberman.

1074
01:47:03,528 --> 01:47:05,403
Get up, Jew!

1075
01:47:06,236 --> 01:47:07,403
Up!

1076
01:47:08,195 --> 01:47:09,362
Up!

1077
01:47:13,070 --> 01:47:16,320
Yes, I am going to kill you,

1078
01:47:17,154 --> 01:47:19,529
but I want you to go to your death
with the knowledge

1079
01:47:19,529 --> 01:47:21,445
that all your efforts have gone
for nothing!

1080
01:47:21,737 --> 01:47:23,821
I have the money, and
I have the will!

1081
01:47:23,821 --> 01:47:26,238
And no one can stop me!

1082
01:47:28,071 --> 01:47:30,363
Did you kill Wheelock?

1083
01:47:30,905 --> 01:47:35,613
No, he's in the kitchen,
mixing us some cocktails.

1084
01:47:43,822 --> 01:47:48,489
Do you know what I saw on the
television in my motel room

1085
01:47:48,489 --> 01:47:49,947
at one o'clock this morning?

1086
01:47:52,532 --> 01:47:54,740
Films of Hitler.

1087
01:47:56,407 --> 01:47:58,615
They are showing films
about the war,

1088
01:47:59,240 --> 01:48:03,032
the movement, people are
fascinated,

1089
01:48:03,240 --> 01:48:05,574
the time is ripe.

1090
01:48:06,824 --> 01:48:10,241
Adolf Hitler is alive.

1091
01:48:14,449 --> 01:48:16,866
Tis album is full of pictures of him.

1092
01:48:17,908 --> 01:48:22,117
Bobby Wheelock and ninety-three
other boys

1093
01:48:22,117 --> 01:48:24,992
are exact genetic duplicates of him.

1094
01:48:25,159 --> 01:48:27,450
Bred entirely from his cells.

1095
01:48:28,742 --> 01:48:32,159
He allowed me to take half
a litre of his blood

1096
01:48:32,159 --> 01:48:34,618
and a cutting of skin from his ribs.

1097
01:48:38,451 --> 01:48:41,451
We were in a biblical frame of mind.

1098
01:48:42,160 --> 01:48:46,827
On the 23rd of May, 1943,
at the Berghof.

1099
01:48:47,952 --> 01:48:52,536
He had denied himself children
because he knew that no son

1100
01:48:52,536 --> 01:48:55,786
could flourish in the shadow
of so God-like a father.

1101
01:48:56,202 --> 01:49:01,245
But then he heard what was
theoretically possible

1102
01:49:01,787 --> 01:49:07,662
that I could create one day not his son
not even a carbon copy,

1103
01:49:07,662 --> 01:49:09,495
but another original!

1104
01:49:10,287 --> 01:49:13,037
He was thrilled by the idea!

1105
01:49:13,662 --> 01:49:17,079
The right Hitler for the right future.

1106
01:49:17,579 --> 01:49:24,913
A Hitler tailor-made for the 1980's,
'90's, 2000.

1107
01:49:39,789 --> 01:49:40,914
Kill!

1108
01:50:11,875 --> 01:50:13,000
Away!

1109
01:50:14,208 --> 01:50:15,417
Off!

1110
01:50:18,708 --> 01:50:19,792
No more gun.

1111
01:50:32,084 --> 01:50:33,793
Holy shit!

1112
01:50:37,293 --> 01:50:38,293
Bobby.

1113
01:50:41,294 --> 01:50:42,335
Bobby.

1114
01:50:43,252 --> 01:50:45,502
My dear, dear boy.

1115
01:50:46,210 --> 01:50:49,669
You cannot possibly imagine
how happy I am,

1116
01:50:49,669 --> 01:50:56,586
how joyous I am, to see you standing
there so fine, strong and handsome.

1117
01:50:57,711 --> 01:51:00,795
Call these dogs off, Bobby,
call the dogs off, please.

1118
01:51:05,420 --> 01:51:08,212
I'm an old friend of the family.

1119
01:51:09,629 --> 01:51:12,879
In fact I'm the doctor
who delivered you.

1120
01:51:13,671 --> 01:51:17,754
And I stopped by, having just
returned from abroad,

1121
01:51:19,171 --> 01:51:21,255
and he let me in.

1122
01:51:21,963 --> 01:51:24,463
And then he pulled out a gun,

1123
01:51:26,463 --> 01:51:29,380
fortunately I was able
to overpower him.

1124
01:51:30,338 --> 01:51:33,922
Now call them off, Bobby,
call them off, please.

1125
01:51:35,964 --> 01:51:37,048
Cut!

1126
01:51:38,548 --> 01:51:40,964
Cut, how clever.

1127
01:51:40,964 --> 01:51:47,256
I said, 'off', and I said, 'away' and
I said 'no gun, no more gun'.

1128
01:51:47,714 --> 01:51:50,840
- Then you had the gun.
- No, he had, he...

1129
01:51:50,840 --> 01:51:53,507
They're trained to attack
anyone carrying a gun.

1130
01:51:53,757 --> 01:51:57,007
- They were locked up and let them out.
- The dogs are never locked up.

1131
01:51:58,049 --> 01:51:59,340
Bobby.

1132
01:52:00,049 --> 01:52:01,799
- My dear, dear...
- Action!

1133
01:52:03,925 --> 01:52:05,633
Cut.
Cut!

1134
01:52:06,091 --> 01:52:07,591
They won't listen to you.

1135
01:52:10,133 --> 01:52:11,175
Bobby.

1136
01:52:11,383 --> 01:52:15,091
That man is your enemy,
don't listen to him, I beg of you.

1137
01:52:15,633 --> 01:52:17,509
Call the police.

1138
01:52:18,676 --> 01:52:19,676
Yeah.

1139
01:52:21,259 --> 01:52:23,217
By all means, do so, Bobby,

1140
01:52:23,467 --> 01:52:26,759
but first there are some things
about yourself you must know.

1141
01:52:35,802 --> 01:52:36,677
What do you mean?

1142
01:52:36,677 --> 01:52:40,510
If I prove to you that I know you
better than anyone in the world,

1143
01:52:41,177 --> 01:52:44,343
better even than your own mother,
will you listen to me?

1144
01:52:48,553 --> 01:52:50,511
You are a clever boy.

1145
01:52:51,428 --> 01:52:52,553
Are you not?

1146
01:52:54,011 --> 01:52:58,594
You do not do well in school,
that is because you are too clever.

1147
01:52:59,345 --> 01:53:02,262
Too busy thinking your own thoughts,

1148
01:53:02,262 --> 01:53:06,095
but you are much smarter than
your teachers, eh?

1149
01:53:06,304 --> 01:53:08,137
My teachers are nowhere.

1150
01:53:08,512 --> 01:53:12,805
You are going to be the world's
greatest photographer, are you not?

1151
01:53:15,221 --> 01:53:18,388
Have you ever felt superior
to those around you?

1152
01:53:18,555 --> 01:53:21,013
Like a prince among peasants?

1153
01:53:21,638 --> 01:53:24,138
I feel different from everyone
sometimes.

1154
01:53:24,430 --> 01:53:27,056
You are infinitely different.

1155
01:53:27,764 --> 01:53:29,472
Infinitely superior.

1156
01:53:30,347 --> 01:53:32,806
You were born of the noblest blood
in the world.

1157
01:53:33,847 --> 01:53:36,806
You have it within you
to fulfil ambitions

1158
01:53:36,931 --> 01:53:41,140
a thousand times greater than
those of which you presently dream.

1159
01:53:41,515 --> 01:53:43,765
And you shall fulfil them, Bobby.

1160
01:53:44,098 --> 01:53:45,348
You shall.

1161
01:53:45,973 --> 01:53:48,723
You are the living duplicate
of the greatest man

1162
01:53:48,973 --> 01:53:49,973
in history.

1163
01:53:53,432 --> 01:53:55,308
Adolf Hitler.

1164
01:54:02,183 --> 01:54:03,849
Oh, man, you're weird.

1165
01:54:07,766 --> 01:54:09,809
Bobby, I'm telling you the truth.

1166
01:54:10,017 --> 01:54:14,350
- Find your father.
- What?

1167
01:54:14,600 --> 01:54:19,850
He killed your father.

1168
01:54:22,517 --> 01:54:24,101
Bobby, listen to me.

1169
01:54:25,351 --> 01:54:29,476
It was this vicious Jew,
your sworn enemy.

1170
01:54:30,018 --> 01:54:32,810
He killed your father, and he came
here to kill you.

1171
01:54:34,851 --> 01:54:35,893
<i>Bobby.</i>

1172
01:54:36,936 --> 01:54:38,561
<i>Let me protect you.</i>

1173
01:54:40,394 --> 01:54:44,394
All your power will burst forth
when the time comes.

1174
01:54:45,394 --> 01:54:46,561
When you grow older

1175
01:54:47,269 --> 01:54:50,895
<i>and you see the world engulfed</i>
<i>by human garbage.</i>

1176
01:54:51,645 --> 01:54:57,353
When you feel this urge rising within
you to save your own Aryan folk

1177
01:54:57,353 --> 01:54:58,853
from extintion.

1178
01:55:00,187 --> 01:55:02,895
Then you will rejoice
in your heritage

1179
01:55:03,103 --> 01:55:05,938
<i>and bless me for creating you.</i>

1180
01:55:09,563 --> 01:55:10,688
Bobby!

1181
01:55:11,271 --> 01:55:15,688
You must understand!
Your parents are of no importance!

1182
01:55:15,688 --> 01:55:17,271
They were chosen for you!

1183
01:55:18,646 --> 01:55:20,730
Now that they have served
their purpose

1184
01:55:21,147 --> 01:55:23,814
they must disappear from your life!

1185
01:55:25,730 --> 01:55:26,814
Bobby!

1186
01:55:28,980 --> 01:55:30,564
Bobby!

1187
01:55:31,022 --> 01:55:32,772
You freaked-out maniac!

1188
01:55:33,648 --> 01:55:34,648
Bite!

1189
01:56:03,233 --> 01:56:04,067
Bobby!

1190
01:56:08,275 --> 01:56:10,233
Holy shit!

1191
01:56:12,650 --> 01:56:13,650
Cut.

1192
01:56:15,068 --> 01:56:16,109
Cut!

1193
01:56:17,568 --> 01:56:18,818
Cut!

1194
01:56:24,609 --> 01:56:25,901
Hey, man!

1195
01:56:26,984 --> 01:56:28,026
Get out of here!

1196
01:56:33,610 --> 01:56:34,777
Out.

1197
01:56:49,986 --> 01:56:52,695
I think you'll die if I don't call
an ambulance for you.

1198
01:56:55,861 --> 01:56:57,446
I could just go out right now,

1199
01:56:57,779 --> 01:56:59,737
my mum won't be home until late.

1200
01:57:00,696 --> 01:57:02,321
You'll be dead by then.

1201
01:57:03,737 --> 01:57:06,821
If I call the police, will you tell
them what I did?

1202
01:57:11,738 --> 01:57:12,738
Okay.

1203
01:57:13,363 --> 01:57:14,363
Shake.

1204
01:57:19,447 --> 01:57:20,655
Come on, shake.

1205
01:57:22,613 --> 01:57:24,822
Okay, you got a deal.

1206
01:57:42,490 --> 01:57:45,782
<i>I'd like an ambulance and a police</i>
<i>car to the Wheelock residence</i>

1207
01:57:45,782 --> 01:57:47,449
<i>on Old Buck Road, please.</i>

1208
01:57:51,657 --> 01:57:53,408
Hey, man, this is an emergency.

1209
01:57:55,408 --> 01:57:57,158
A heavy duty emergency.

1210
01:58:41,036 --> 01:58:42,036
David.

1211
01:58:43,244 --> 01:58:44,911
What a surprise.

1212
01:58:45,536 --> 01:58:47,703
Which one of the assassins
was it, Mr. Lieberman?

1213
01:58:49,579 --> 01:58:52,204
I thought you went to a wedding.

1214
01:58:53,870 --> 01:58:55,329
No more deception now.

1215
01:58:55,954 --> 01:58:57,537
No more blind alleys.

1216
01:58:57,829 --> 01:58:58,829
All right.

1217
01:58:59,995 --> 01:59:01,162
It was Mengele.

1218
01:59:02,245 --> 01:59:03,371
He's dead.

1219
01:59:05,288 --> 01:59:06,330
It's over.

1220
01:59:06,705 --> 01:59:08,455
The Doring boy ins't dead yet.

1221
01:59:08,913 --> 01:59:12,871
Neither is Simon Harrington, nor
Jack Curry or Bobby Wheelock.

1222
01:59:14,663 --> 01:59:17,372
It took a little time, a little
back tracking,

1223
01:59:17,372 --> 01:59:19,456
a visit to Dr. Bruckner.

1224
01:59:20,206 --> 01:59:21,497
But now we know...

1225
01:59:21,956 --> 01:59:22,997
everything.

1226
01:59:23,997 --> 01:59:26,956
And what are you going
to do about it?

1227
01:59:29,414 --> 01:59:30,539
Kill the boys.

1228
01:59:35,915 --> 01:59:37,540
Brilliant man that Mengele.

1229
01:59:39,665 --> 01:59:43,290
I suppose he had all 94 of those
names and addresses memorized.

1230
01:59:45,416 --> 01:59:47,874
Now, you are trying to fool me.

1231
01:59:49,791 --> 01:59:52,541
You have been searching the room.

1232
01:59:52,791 --> 01:59:55,416
- He must've had a list.
- He did, now I have it.

1233
01:59:55,708 --> 01:59:56,708
Give it to me.

1234
01:59:56,999 --> 01:59:58,166
Why?

1235
01:59:59,584 --> 02:00:01,334
We have the right and
we have the duty.

1236
02:00:01,875 --> 02:00:04,250
To do what?
Kill children?

1237
02:00:04,584 --> 02:00:05,834
Give me that list.

1238
02:00:13,042 --> 02:00:15,293
You'll have to take it from me.

1239
02:00:15,960 --> 02:00:19,043
And when you do you can add
my name to the list.

1240
02:00:19,418 --> 02:00:21,043
I don't mean you any harm.

1241
02:00:21,543 --> 02:00:23,585
You'll have to kill me, David.

1242
02:00:24,751 --> 02:00:27,293
The first of those boys
that you touch,

1243
02:00:28,002 --> 02:00:33,002
I will turn you and your entire
organization over to the police.

1244
02:00:33,919 --> 02:00:35,544
I swear I'll do that.

1245
02:00:36,502 --> 02:00:38,794
You would protect Hitler?

1246
02:00:39,377 --> 02:00:40,544
No.

1247
02:00:41,962 --> 02:00:47,087
Not... not slaughter the innocnet,
and neither will you.

1248
02:00:47,628 --> 02:00:52,295
A fanatic you may be, but a murderer
of young children you are not.

1249
02:00:53,628 --> 02:00:55,754
You know, there is a nurse here,

1250
02:00:56,588 --> 02:01:00,463
an angel of mercy called
Miss Hanrahan,

1251
02:01:00,921 --> 02:01:03,838
who actually gives me cigarettes.

1252
02:01:03,838 --> 02:01:05,754
You know, what she said to me
the other day?

1253
02:01:05,754 --> 02:01:10,089
She said, 'Mr. Lieberman, if you can
escape Buchenwald

1254
02:01:11,422 --> 02:01:16,922
and you can escape those bullets,
then a few cigarettes will not hurt you.'

1255
02:01:25,131 --> 02:01:26,840
Wasn't that a nice thing to say?

1256
02:01:58,550 --> 02:01:59,883
Mad.
