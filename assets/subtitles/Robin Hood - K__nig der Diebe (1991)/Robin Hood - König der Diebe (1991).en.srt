300MB UNiTED TEAM - sunmenghao

2
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:56,175
Show them the courage of Allah!

3
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,915
- He says you stole the bread.
- It's a lie.

4
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:31,126
I caught him stealing ours.

5
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,462
Cut off the infidel's hand.

6
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,589
No, I took the bread!

7
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,342
- That's not true.
- They're not interested in the truth.

8
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,887
- But he's lying!
- You're too weak, Peter. You won't live.

9
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,096
- As you wish.

10
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:46,934
- Cut the other's hand off as well.
- I'm sorry.

11
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:49,186
I'm sorry, Robin.

12
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,358
Oh, God!

13
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,159
No! No! No!

14
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,304
This is English courage.

15
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,864
That's for five years of hell!

16
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,790
Behind you!

17
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,843
Come on, Robin, for God's sake!
Come on!

18
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,638
Wait! Take us with you!

19
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,229
You cannot save those people, Christian!

20
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,816
- But you can save me!
- They're coming, Robin.

21
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,528
Christian!

22
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,905
- Why should I?
- For pity's sake.

23
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:27,034
- Mine is a sentence of death.
- He's a Moor! Don't listen!

24
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,411
Set me free! I will show you a way out.

25
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,998
- Why should we?
- If you do not, we are all dead men.

26
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,043
No, Robin, for God's sake!
Robin, they're coming!

27
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,428
- I'm sorry.
- Hurry! Come, Christian! Come!

28
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,437
This way!

29
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,280
Thanks. I misjudged you.

30
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,782
You are fast with a sword.

31
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:10,577
Five years I have waited to smell
free air. That makes a man fast.

32
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,456
Peter!

33
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,128
It's mortal.

34
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,797
Leave me.

35
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,301
Give this ring to my sister, Marian.

36
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,720
Now swear you'll protect her for me.

37
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,848
His wound is by the heart.
We cannot save him.

38
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,142
Swear it, Robin!

39
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,853
- I swear it.
- They're coming!

40
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:39,815
Tell Marian I died a free Englishman.

41
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,902
Peter! Peter. Peter!

42
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,904
For England!

43
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:53,829
Come, my friend.
Make his sacrifice an act of honor.

44
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,664
Come now!

45
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,403
Why did you cut me free, Christian?

46
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:31,575
Whatever blood is in your veins,
no man deserves to die in there.

47
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,708
Farewell, friend.

48
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,835
God speed your way.

49
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,504
Our way lies together
with the speed of Allah.

50
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:45,755
What?

51
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,591
You have saved my life, Christian.

52
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:51,428
I will stay with you until I have saved yours.
That is my vow.

53
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:55,390
Thanks, but I go to England.
I relieve you of your obligation.

54
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,642
Only Allah can do that.

55
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,062
What if I say no?

56
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,647
You have no choice.

57
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,234
I am Azeem Edin Bashir Al Bakir.

58
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,528
You may call me Azeem.

59
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,533
Robin of Locksley.

60
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,174
Kindest sir:

61
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,260
It is rumored you fought
in King Richard's Crusade ...

62
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,930
 ... with my beloved son, Robin.

63
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,850
I fear you have returned home
to desperate times ...

64
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:42,771
 ... when dark forces
plot against our absent king.

65
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,857
I am anxious for word of my son.

66
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:49,277
Were you present at his capture
near Jerusalem?

67
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,864
Do you know the name of the potentate
who holds him?

68
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:56,117
Does he still bear me ill will?

69
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,620
A little news, please, sir.

70
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:02,958
I would give all that I own
for his release.

71
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,724
- Stop there!
- Help me, my lord!

72
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,394
You should have waited!

73
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:27,566
- I'm sorry you were disturbed, master.
- Duncan, it's all right. Let him go.

74
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,113
They've taken my Gwen.
My daughter!

75
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:36,408
- Who's taken her?
- Men! On horses.

76
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,618
In masks.

77
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,829
We tried to stop them, but --

78
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,790
My son is dead.

79
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,667
He's dead.

80
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:58,138
Master, stay.
There is an evil moon tonight.

81
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:01,016
Never fear, Duncan.
Good will overcome.

82
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,310
Trust in that.

83
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:20,535
I'm sorry, my lord.
I had no choice.

84
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,378
You!

85
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:32,839
Locksley.

86
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,133
The king shall hear of this!

87
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,052
Join us.

88
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,845
Never.

89
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,598
Join us ...

90
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,683
 ... or die.

91
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:49,814
God and King Richard!

92
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,952
Thank you, Lord.

93
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:52,877
I'm home!

94
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,132
You are strange, Christian.

95
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,634
Yes. But I'm free!

96
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:04,139
Now I beg you to free yourself of your vow.
Return with the boat.

97
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:07,976
I know how it feels to be so far
from your home and family.

98
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:12,814
Because I love them so much,
I cannot dishonor them.

99
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,736
I thought you'd say that.

100
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,756
No man controls my destiny.

101
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:41,551
Especially not one who attacks
downwind and stinks of garlic.

102
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,933
Come, Azeem!

103
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:53,229
Our fighting days are done.

104
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:57,567
By nightfall,
we'll celebrate with my father.

105
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,698
You understand, of course ...

106
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,408
 ... I had to try.

107
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,660
I would have succeeded.

108
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,169
Why must you walk in back of me?

109
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:19,047
In your country, am I not the infidel?

110
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:24,844
It seems safer to appear as your slave
rather than your equal.

111
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,806
For an infidel you have
uncommon clarity of thinking.

112
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:31,184
Yet you tell me of nothing of yourself.
For instance, your name.

113
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,895
- Azeem. What does it mean?
- It means "great one."

114
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:37,607
Great one, really?
Did you give yourself this name?

115
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,153
It's a joke.

116
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:48,743
Azeem the great one, I am home!

117
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:53,665
Look!

118
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,001
Mistletoe.

119
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:02,715
Many a maid's lost her resolve to me
thanks to this little plant.

120
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,846
In my country, we talk to our women.

121
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,598
We do not drug them with plants.

122
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,059
What do you know of women?

123
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,981
Where I come from, Christian ...

124
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:22,485
 ... there are women of such beauty
they can possess a man's mind so ...

125
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,113
 ... that he would be willing
to die for them.

126
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:30,201
Wait. Is that why
you were to be executed?

127
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,662
Because of a woman?

128
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,959
That's it, isn't it?

129
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,794
That's it!

130
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,383
It is close to sunset.

131
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,136
You painted old dog.
Who was she?

132
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,346
The mullah's daughter?

133
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,349
Huh?

134
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,685
Another man's wife?

135
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,479
What's her name?

136
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:03,359
Is there no sun in this cursed country?!

137
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,820
Which way is east?

138
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,323
- Her name?
- East!

139
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,325
Her name.

140
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,456
Jasmina.

141
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,499
That way.

142
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,169
- You are sure?
- I'd know blindfolded.

143
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,504
I'm five miles from home.

144
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,095
Was she worth it?

145
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,557
Worth dying for.

146
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,327
Come on, boy, run!

147
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,375
You're dog's meat, son!

148
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,737
You're dog's meat, son,
do you know that?

149
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:34,784
Get down here! You know what
you've done. Come down here!

150
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:38,538
- Down!
- You're not playing by the rules, boy.

151
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:41,207
Deer don't climb trees.

152
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,793
Perhaps he thinks he's a game bird.

153
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,629
Shall we teach him to fly?

154
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,924
Get him down.

155
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,468
Hold.

156
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:58,266
I'm curious as to what manner of creature
is so fearsome it takes six men to attack it?

157
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:01,477
Stand down. This is no affair of yours.

158
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:04,647
Well, have we treed the devil himself?
Let me see.

159
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,152
A small boy, a truly dangerous animal.

160
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:12,947
This boy killed one
of the Sheriff of Nottingham's deer.

161
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,658
You starve us! We needed the meat.

162
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:19,287
I advise you to move on, pilgrim.
This is the sheriff's land.

163
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,997
Wrong.

164
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:25,835
This is my land and my tree. Therefore
whatever's in it also belongs to me.

165
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:32,675
Might I have the pleasure of your name
before I have you run through?

166
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,803
Robin of Locksley.

167
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:43,019
Well, well ... .
Locksley.

168
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:46,272
Welcome home.

169
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:50,151
- Kill him!
- To arms, swords!

170
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,236
- Come on, hurry up!
- He's armed!

171
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,491
Azeem! It's time to redeem that vow!

172
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:59,869
Unleash the hounds!

173
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,081
Get off your damn knees!

174
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,669
Look out!

175
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,886
Yeah!

176
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:23,518
Now, sir ...

177
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:27,730
 ... if you'd be so kind as to give me
your name before I run you through.

178
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:31,734
Guy of Gisborne, the sheriff's cousin.

179
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:37,156
- That little bastard was poaching deer.
- Poach?

180
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:40,034
Is it not a greater crime
to starve a family?

181
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,371
Go on, Locksley.

182
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:45,498
Go on.

183
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,461
I've seen enough blood spilt
to last two lifetimes.

184
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,381
Now get off my land.

185
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:04,350
Tell Nottingham what happens to his scum
when they pick on small children.

186
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,397
You.

187
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:13,526
You travel 10,000 miles to save my life,
then leave me to be butchered?!

188
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,237
I fulfill my vows when I choose.

189
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:19,407
Which does not include prayer times
or meal times ...

190
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,826
 ... or any time I'm outnumbered 6 to 1.

191
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,370
You whine like a mule.

192
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,415
You are still alive.

193
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,716
Have no fear. Come down, boy.

194
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,848
Is it true, boy? Did you kill a deer?

195
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,435
Hundreds of them.

196
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,900
You scared him.

197
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,949
Interesting place, this ...

198
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,701
 ... England.

199
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:27,225
Hold up, Sir Guy.
The sheriff's not to be disturbed.

200
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,151
Cousin.

201
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:41,656
I trust you justify your intrusion
with news of profound value.

202
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:47,578
I met a hooded man today who bade me
warn you not to harm his people.

203
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,122
Who told you to cover up?

204
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,500
His name?

205
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,752
Robin of Locksley.

206
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,213
The prodigal son returns.

207
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,383
He's a whelp!
This girl could best him.

208
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,677
Put it there!

209
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:10,101
Yes, well, this whelp
bested four of my men.

210
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,771
Yes, well, your men were probably drunk.

211
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:19,068
- Yet you survived, cousin.
- I barely survived.

212
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,201
-- markings of Islam.

213
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:30,871
I'm sure it will take an army
to match these rogues.

214
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:36,627
I trust Locksley visited his manor
and found the home fires still burning.

215
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,589
Time for portents, cousin.

216
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,853
Mortianna?

217
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,788
Shut up.

218
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,633
You called, madam?

219
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,125
What do you see?

220
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,256
- The son of a dead man.
- Locksley.

221
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:09,303
- Does he affect us?
- He precedes the Lionheart.

222
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:12,765
King Richard returns from the Crusades.
That could prove awkward ...

223
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,518
 ... and will soften the spines
of the barons. Soon?

224
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:17,478
Make haste.

225
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:20,189
But my plan is still intact?

226
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,277
What is wrong?

227
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:28,948
I have seen our death.

228
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:32,451
The painted man,
he haunts my dreams.

229
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:36,539
Adorned with strange,
foreign markings.

230
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:39,083
Locksley's companion!

231
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:43,712
Kill him. Kill them both.

232
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:52,930
Father?

233
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:57,768
Father! Anyone here?

234
00:23:58,687 --> 00:23:59,812
Duncan!

235
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,356
Father!

236
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,618
No.

237
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:20,082
No!

238
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:23,502
- Who is it?
- It's my father.

239
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:34,555
Who's there?

240
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,515
Master Robin?

241
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,560
Is that you?

242
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,145
Duncan?

243
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,899
Praise be! I thought God
had abandoned us.

244
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,400
Duncan, my father --

245
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,694
- It's a miracle!
- Why --?

246
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:51,780
- Why didn't you cut him down?
- It's a miracle, I never thought --

247
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:55,034
- Damn you, Duncan, are you deaf?!
- Easy!

248
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,869
Look at him.

249
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:01,165
I would have done if I could see.

250
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:07,296
Who did this to you, Duncan?

251
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:10,591
Guy. Guy of Gisborne.

252
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,719
With the sheriff and his witch
looking on.

253
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:17,431
- Why?
- They say the sheriff captured your father ...

254
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,308
 ... worshipping the devil.

255
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,811
That he signed a confession
before the bishop.

256
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,982
No, that's not possible.

257
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:31,153
Nottingham declared
all Locksley lands forfeit.

258
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:34,114
Did you believe the charges?

259
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:38,369
Not even when they took my eyes.

260
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,549
We must go.

261
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:58,347
He loved you to the end, young master.

262
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:01,308
He never gave up hope of your return.

263
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,644
I should have been here.

264
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:09,066
He called the Crusades a foolish quest.

265
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:13,654
He said it was vanity to force
other men to our religion.

266
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,282
But you must flee now.

267
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:19,743
Head south to safety.
Gisborne will surely seek revenge.

268
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,079
I hear you, Duncan.

269
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,666
You should go home.

270
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:29,378
My world is turned upside down here.

271
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:32,423
I cannot ask you to come
where I am going.

272
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:36,135
Alone, Christian,
you will only get yourself killed.

273
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,179
Besides ...

274
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:43,142
 ... there is nothing left
for me to go home to.

275
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:51,233
I will not rest
until my father's avenged!

276
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:57,197
I swear it ...

277
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,408
 ... by my own blood.

278
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,713
What is this place?

279
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,548
Peter's home.

280
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:18,135
It's nearly six years
since we left together.

281
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:21,138
We'll find food and shelter here.

282
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,727
No more beggars!

283
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:39,073
Tell the mistress of the house
Robin of Locksley's at her door.

284
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,617
Her ladyship's not here.

285
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,953
Is the child Marian at home?

286
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:47,623
Maybe she is, maybe she isn't.

287
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:55,464
The hospitality in this country
is as warm as the weather.

288
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,926
- It's a joke.
- Really?

289
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,178
Leave your weapons.

290
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,974
Just you.

291
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,700
Wait here.

292
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,411
right here?

293
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:34,294
A curse on Moors and Saracens!

294
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:39,591
Were it not for their ungodly ways,
Master Robin would never have left.

295
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:45,556
What manner of name is Azeem?

296
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,392
Irish? Cornish?

297
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:51,019
Moorish.

298
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,942
Who are you?

299
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,654
Robin of Locksley.

300
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,364
You lie. Robin is dead.

301
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,200
Step into the light.

302
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,124
Turn around.

303
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:18,422
Am I to dance next?

304
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:24,094
- Who are you?
- I am the Maid Marian.

305
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:28,182
Well, then show yourself, child,
for we knew each other well.

306
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:40,944
The years have ...

307
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,614
 ... been kind.
- Thank you.

308
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:47,409
With the king away,
we must guard against villainous outlaws ...

309
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:51,747
 ... who would kidnap a relative of his.
- You can see I am not one of those.

310
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,874
Perhaps.

311
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:57,252
Now remove yourself from this house.

312
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:02,424
I would, my lady,
but I'm sworn to protect you.

313
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,301
Protect me?

314
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:08,055
Robin of Locksley was nothing
but a spoiled bully.

315
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:14,269
And besides, as you can see,
we have enough protection.

316
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:16,396
Marian, wait!

317
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:22,027
You are truly courageous
against an unarmed man.

318
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:36,083
Point me toward danger, Azeem!
I'm ready!

319
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:14,580
Hello, Marian.

320
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:24,715
His last thoughts were of you.

321
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,471
Oh, Peter.

322
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,768
I'm sorry, Marian.

323
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,354
I'm sorry.

324
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:45,193
How do I know you didn't abandon him
to save your own skin?

325
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,322
No one feels his loss more than I.

326
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:51,950
Next time I'm in London,
I'll give my mother your condolences.

327
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:58,165
I would think for your safety
that you would join her there.

328
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,876
I have no interest in life at court.

329
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:04,296
All that gossip-mongering
and currying favor.

330
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:07,633
But you're alone here.

331
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:12,679
Hardly.
These years have left us many in need.

332
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:17,809
While you and my brother played heroes,
Nottingham plundered the shire.

333
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:20,520
I see you still have your lands.

334
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,817
Because I give him
no excuse to take them.

335
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:31,365
I am the king's cousin. It is my station
to look after these people until his return.

336
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:36,370
Marian.

337
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:41,458
Marian. Marian.

338
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:46,713
My purpose in coming here
was not to hurt you.

339
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:51,218
I swore ... I swore to your brother
that I would protect you.

340
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:54,888
You cannot replace my brother.

341
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,350
I don't want to replace him.

342
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:03,063
I've returned to find my home destroyed
and my father murdered.

343
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:07,234
The only explanations for it
are the ramblings of an old blind man.

344
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:12,239
All I remember of you
is a spoiled bully ...

345
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:15,784
 ... who used to burn my hair as a child.

346
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:20,998
Please allow that years of war and prison
may change a man.

347
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:29,715
Robin, whatever happened between you
and your father, you mustn't believe ...

348
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:32,175
 ... what they accused him of.

349
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:34,094
I don't.

350
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,346
Christian!

351
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,606
Look.

352
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:48,400
Look!

353
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:14,593
How did your uneducated kind
ever take Jerusalem?

354
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:15,844
God knows.

355
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,429
What is it?

356
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,815
- What is it?
- It's Nottingham's soldiers.

357
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:31,985
Coming here? Is this your protection?

358
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:35,322
- I killed some of the sheriff's men.
- Oh, dear.

359
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,158
I fear I have placed you in danger.

360
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,619
I can take care of myself.
Just go!

361
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,913
No, that's my horse!

362
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,415
A truly magnificent animal, my lady.

363
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,170
Come on!

364
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:55,258
- Go!
- I said, I'm sworn to protect you.

365
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,594
And I say no more boyish gestures.

366
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,763
I'm not leaving.

367
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:05,811
Stop them!
They're stealing my horses!

368
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:09,689
- You're so kind, Marian.
- Ooh!

369
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,377
Been sheltering outlaws,
Lady Marian?

370
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:35,006
- They're thieves, you imbecile.
- Lucky he didn't steal your virtue as well.

371
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:38,468
A crown to the man who brings me
Locksley's head! My lady.

372
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,346
Have we lost them?

373
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:25,599
No!

374
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,728
My horse carries two. Yours is lame.
We cannot outrun them.

375
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:33,398
Leave me, Master Robin!
I slow your escape.

376
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:38,111
- We can lose them in the forest.
- Sherwood Forest is haunted.

377
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:42,365
Either we take our chances with ghosts
or become ghosts ourselves.

378
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,223
Come on, damn you!

379
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,891
There are only three of them!

380
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:11,728
It's not the men we fear, sir.
It's the evil spirits.

381
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,980
Robin of the Hood!

382
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:16,524
Son of a devil worshipper!

383
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:18,652
Your father died a coward ...

384
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:22,572


 ... cursing your name
and squealing like a stuck pig!

385
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:26,743
You will bring no justice to your father
by dying today.

386
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,524
Master Robin?

387
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:00,360
There are your ghosts, Duncan.

388
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:02,237
Wind chimes.

389
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:05,031
A child's toy put to good use.

390
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:09,244
You scare easily, my painted Moor.

391
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,375
This forest has eyes.

392
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:17,544
I swear it.

393
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:40,108
In my dreams alone
have I imagined such a place.

394
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:44,237
Then imagine a way to cross it.

395
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:17,854
There's hope!

396
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:25,278
There was a rich man from Nottingham

397
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,447
Who tried to cross the river

398
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:30,033
What a dope
He tripped on a rope

399
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,452
Now look at him shiver

400
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,413
Beg for mercy, rich man!

401
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,293
I beg of no man.

402
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:56,017
This here is our river, and any man
who wishes to cross must pay a tax.

403
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:58,561
I will pay no tax.

404
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:02,148
As you can see, I have nothing.

405
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,944
- Not even my sword.
- Bollocks!

406
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:09,155
Any man who travels with two servants ...

407
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:12,158
 ... and claims he's got no bloody money ...

408
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:17,163
 ... is either a fool or a liar.
- Yeah, he's a liar!

409
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:20,375
- Who are you?
- John Little.

410
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:24,421
Best man of the woods.
Eh, lads?

411
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:27,090
Tell him, John!
That's right!

412
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:32,512
Well, best man, you lead this rabble?

413
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,681
Yes, I do, mate.

414
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:39,853
And if you tosspots want to travel through
Sherwood Forest, it's gonna cost you ...

415
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,605
 ... that gold medallion.

416
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,028
This is sacred to me.

417
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:51,614
It's sacred to us too, mate.

418
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:55,577
That there will feed us
for a blooming month.

419
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:58,705
- You'll have to fight me for it.
- Ooh!

420
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:00,707
Love to, mate.

421
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,715
Be careful, Father.

422
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:11,009
He walloped 12 of the sheriff's men.

423
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,052
Is that so?

424
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,722
Reckon I'm gonna enjoy this.

425
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:18,057
Hey.

426
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:21,311
That's your father?

427
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:27,734
You should help me.

428
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,134
Wee!

429
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:56,054
He's drowning!

430
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:59,432
Lost something?

431
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:04,187
Thanks for the taxes.

432
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,941
Looks like the little rich boy's
lost for words, eh?

433
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:13,488
- Any great ideas?
- Get up! Move faster!

434
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,449
Move faster. Great idea.

435
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:25,708
Watch it, John!

436
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:33,299
- We're not through yet.
- All right, my old cocker.

437
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:35,802
You want another good walloping?

438
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,845
You shall have one.

439
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:52,110
Seems I've made it past the gate,
John Little.

440
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:56,614
- Or should I call you Little John?
- Hit him, Father! Wallop him!

441
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,918
- You can do it!
- Good shot!

442
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:12,714
- You've bloodied him, John,
you've bloodied him.

443
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:21,431
Swimming time again, old chum.

444
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:38,698
Where is he? Do you see him?

445
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:53,755
It's a blooming shame!

446
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:55,923
He was a brave lad!

447
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,555
Help!

448
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:06,643
- Do you yield?
- I can't bloody swim!

449
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,563
- Do you yield?
- Yes!

450
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:14,359
Good. Now put your feet down.

451
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:20,865
I'll be buggered.

452
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:26,412
- The medallion.
- Give me your name first.

453
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,665
Robin of Locksley.

454
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:32,293
Well, Robin of Locksley ...

455
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:35,338
 ... you got balls of solid rock.
Come on.

456
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:42,595
That's Much, the miller's son,
Harold Brownwell.

457
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:48,017
That stumpy one is David of Doncaster,
but the lads all calls him Bull.

458
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:50,978
- Because you're short?
- Nope.

459
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:53,898
It's because I'm so long!

460
00:44:56,902 --> 00:45:01,614
- They ought to have a look.
- No, Bull, save it! Save it for the ladies.

461
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:04,617
Give the man some mead.

462
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,622
Now, I made that myself.

463
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:14,961
Has English hospitality
changed so much in six years ...

464
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:17,797
 ... that a friend of mine's not welcome
at this table?

465
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:20,341
But he's a savage, sire!

466
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:23,302
That he is.

467
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:27,432
But no more than you or I.

468
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,853
And don't call me sire.

469
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:37,191
With regret, I must decline.

470
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:41,279
- Allah forbids it.
- Your bloody loss, mate.

471
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:44,365
How is it there are so many of you
in hiding?

472
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:48,327
We're all outlaws.
Got prices on our heads.

473
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:49,996
Even the young lad there.

474
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:54,375
It's that blasted sheriff,
he says we owes him taxes.

475
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:58,755
You know, your ghosts will only keep
the sheriff's men at bay so long.

476
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:01,883
They've worked so far.
You have a better idea?

477
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,141
We can always fight back.

478
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:16,189
I reckon I must've cracked
that noble head of yours.

479
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:18,691
These are all good lads here.

480
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:21,360
They've got hearts of oak,
but they're farmers.

481
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:25,823
It'd be lambs to the slaughter.

482
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:28,743
They say the sheriff
was raised by a witch.

483
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:31,245
- A witch?
- She knows every man's thoughts.

484
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:35,416
- You can see through her. And she flies.
- That's a load of codswallop.

485
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:39,212
What does the rich son of a devil worshipper
care what happens to outlaw peasants?

486
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:41,923
My lord was a kind and generous man!

487
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:45,176
Who among you dares
believe him capable --?

488
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:47,929
My father was no devil worshipper.

489
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:52,308
And I'll have words with any man
who says otherwise.

490
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,021
But he's right.

491
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:01,400
I was a rich man's son.

492
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:06,572
But when I killed the sheriff's men ...

493
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:10,701
 ... I became an outlaw like you.
- You are nothing like us.

494
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:15,957
That there's Will Scarlett.

495
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:19,544
Don't take no notice of him.
He's full of piss and wind.

496
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:22,421
Come on, lads, drink up.

497
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:25,174
Stop talking so much bloody rubbish.

498
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:28,970
This here is the best
that we simple men can expect.

499
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:31,305
Here we're safe.

500
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:35,059
Here we are kings.

501
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:03,296
- Too much mead, old friend?
- Forgive me, I oversleep.

502
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:06,173
No. No, no. Rest yourself.

503
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:19,186
- What day is it, Duncan?
- Sunday, I think.

504
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:23,232
Do they still give alms
to the poor at Mass?

505
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,775
That they do.

506
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:28,946
These days, the need for mercy
is greater than ever.

507
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:47,131
Well, my other god calls.

508
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:51,260
Oh, don't upset yourself, Mortianna.

509
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:55,348
Appearances are important to that lot,
especially on a Sunday.

510
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:59,936
You know my true faith
lies in the old ways.

511
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,689
Although ...

512
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:06,943
 ... frankly, sometimes ...

513
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:11,030
 ... I can't see much difference.

514
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:18,496
Did my parents truly tell you
to instruct me in all this?

515
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,791
Their dying wish.

516
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:04,750
We beseech thy blessing, Lord ...

517
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:09,755
 ... on all your people,
but most especially ...

518
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:13,259
 ... on our noble Sheriff of Nottingham.

519
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:17,596
Grant him the wisdom
to guide and protect ...

520
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:20,266
 ... our glorious city.

521
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:22,768
Grant him also the strength ...

522
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:26,605
 ... to bring to justice
the lawless men ...

523
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:31,152
 ... who would threaten its safety
and prosperity.

524
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:34,030
And the judgment
to punish them ...

525
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:37,491
 ... in your name. Amen.

526
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:40,244
Amen.

527
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:42,204
Go in peace.

528
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:52,423
- Sarah?
- Yes.

529
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:58,596
- That's all I have.
- God bless you, ma'am.

530
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:19,533
Alms for a blind man, my lady?

531
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:23,245
For one who cannot see your beauty?

532
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:29,543
- Hello.
- What are you doing here?

533
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:32,171
Searching my soul.

534
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:35,508
I do not wish to be seen with an outlaw.

535
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:38,177
Do you prefer the company of Nottingham?

536
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:40,054
There's a price on your head.

537
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:42,723
- How much?
- One hundred gold pieces.

538
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,683
Is that all?

539
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:48,729
I shall have to annoy the good sheriff more.
Soon it will be 1,000.

540
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:51,482
For 1,000, I would turn you in myself.

541
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:54,026
Nottingham is mounting an army.

542
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:58,531
He has every blacksmith in the county holed
up in the castle making swords and armor.

543
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:00,950
- What is he planning?
- I don't know.

544
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:03,994
But there's no limit
to the man's ambitions.

545
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:08,749
- Go. Quickly, go!
- Thank you.

546
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:11,335
Robin, do something for me.

547
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:13,712
- What?
- Take a bath.

548
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,881
Take a bath?

549
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:38,279
These are my private chambers, my son.

550
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:42,158
I have priests who would
hear your confession.

551
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:44,201
- Ah!
- Shh.

552
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:52,835
I see the boy I knew
in the man before me.

553
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:56,422
Welcome home, Robin.

554
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:01,135
You shine like the sun, my lady.

555
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:04,096
You've been meeting
with Robin of Locksley.

556
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:08,392
My cousin tells me the knave
deprived you of some horses.

557
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:11,520
- Yes, a most disagreeable experience.
- Yes, I know.

558
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:13,689
And for inflicting that upon you ...

559
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:16,734
 ... I'm going to hang him from the walls
by his entrails.

560
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:17,943
I'd like to see that.

561
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:20,696
If you'd bring your household
within the city ...

562
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:23,199
 ... I could give your needs
personal attention.

563
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:27,870
I do thank you, but I prefer to stay
in my family's home for now.

564
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,916
Well, then perhaps
you'd do me the honor ...

565
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:36,795
 ... of accepting a small token
of my undying devotion to your safety.

566
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:44,803
King Richard would be deeply moved
to hear of your concern for my welfare.

567
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:46,680
Yes. Um ... .

568
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:50,392
I'm afraid the king has many enemies
both abroad and at home.

569
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,645
I fear for his safe return.

570
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:55,606
Oh, no, fear not, dear sheriff.
He will return.

571
00:53:55,774 --> 00:54:00,361
And when he does, he will wish
to reward his faithful subjects.

572
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:09,495
I asked your father three times
if he worshipped the dark one ...

573
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:14,124
 ... because his answer vexed me
so grievously.

574
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:16,669
He said ...

575
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:22,091
 ... he must meet God
with a clear conscience.

576
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:33,727
You lie.

577
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:43,279
On your souls, do not shed blood
in the house of God!

578
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:54,415
You bastard! ln there!

579
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:55,958
Get him!

580
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:03,382
Locksley!

581
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:07,386
I'm going to cut your heart out
with a spoon!

582
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:09,972
Then it begins.

583
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:29,825
- He's taking the sheriff's horse!
- He's stealing the sheriff's horse!

584
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:33,954
Close that gate!

585
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:39,043
The sheriff's horse! Close the gate!
He's stolen the sheriff's horse.

586
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:59,396
What are you looking at?!

587
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,001
Water!

588
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:23,837
- Thank you.
- For the animal.

589
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:27,925
How can I protect you, Christian,
if I know not where you go?

590
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:31,387
You've hardly raised a finger
when you do know ...

591
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:33,347
 ... great one.

592
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:35,432
I prefer to have the choice.

593
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,851
Wonderful! You've stolen
the sheriff's horse?

594
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:40,979
You've stirred up
a bloody hornet's nest now!

595
00:56:41,147 --> 00:56:43,816
- Are you afraid, John?
- Yeah, a little.

596
00:56:43,983 --> 00:56:48,320
So is the sheriff. And today
I gave him a sting he'll not forget.

597
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:52,533
- You fool! You've started a war!
- We're already at war.

598
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:56,995
Bread.

599
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:01,667
And I say we strike back at the very man
who takes our homes ...

600
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:04,211
 ... and would hunt our children.
- We?

601
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:07,673
You planning to join us then, matey?

602
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:10,676
No, to lead you.

603
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:16,598
Christian.

604
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:18,851
These are simple people.

605
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:21,145
They are not warriors.

606
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:24,356
Be careful you do not do this
for your own purposes.

607
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:28,861
You forget yourself, Azeem.
I do not ask for your company or council.

608
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:34,533
Why a spoon, cousin?
Why not an ax?

609
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:38,996
Because it's dull, you twit!
It'll hurt more!

610
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:42,541
I want this brigand found.

611
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:44,293
Starve them out!

612
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:47,379
Slaughter their --
No, take their livestock.

613
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:50,799
I want Locksley's own people
fighting to bring his head in.

614
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:54,052
Perhaps we could create a name for him.

615
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:57,014
Something to drive fear into the hearts
of the populace.

616
00:57:57,182 --> 00:58:00,392
- "Locksley the Lethal" or "Wreaking Robin."
- Whatever.

617
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:04,396
I want him dead by the next full moon,
before the barons come back.

618
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:06,690
Now sew!

619
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:11,445
And keep the stitches small.

620
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:32,174
He's not here, sir.

621
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:35,594
Where is your mate,
the man they call Little?

622
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:39,598
- He died last winter.
- Burn it down!

623
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:49,358
Leave us the sow. Her young
will feed us through winter.

624
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:53,445
- You heard of the Sherwood bandit?
- Robin of the Hood? Yes, sir.

625
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:56,782
Pray he is brought to us
before winter.

626
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:04,748
Over here!

627
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:10,587
Alfred! What's happened to you?

628
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:18,136
- Oh, John!
- Fanny!

629
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:21,348
- Will, they burned it, all of it.
- Are you all right?

630
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:24,851
Where is this Robin Hood?

631
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:26,728
He's there.

632
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:31,233
Look! Look what they've done!

633
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:37,823
If it's fame you seek, Christian ...

634
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:40,867
 ... I think you have it.

635
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:45,664
You brought this misery on us, Locksley.

636
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:50,043
- It's Nottingham trying to divide us.
- We are divided, rich boy.

637
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:52,254
I'm not blind as that old man
over there.

638
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:55,507
You're still trying to be lord of the manor.

639
00:59:55,675 --> 01:00:00,971
I heard today that the sheriff
now values your neck at 500 gold pieces.

640
01:00:02,056 --> 01:00:04,600
I say we take him in.

641
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:10,856
Will, do you think the sheriff will give
everything back after I'm gone?

642
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:14,318
- He'll give us the reward and our pardons.
- Wrong!

643
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:19,323
He'll stretch your necks one by one.

644
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:21,742
What would you have us do?

645
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:26,246
Fight armored men on horseback
with rocks and our bare hands?

646
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:28,290
If needs be.

647
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:32,753
But with the one true weapon
that escapes you, Will.

648
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:35,213
Courage.

649
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:44,640
Look out!

650
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:01,073
Thank you, Wulf.

651
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:04,117
- You wish to end this?
- Yeah.

652
01:01:04,285 --> 01:01:06,161
- You wish to go home?
- Aye.

653
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:10,082
Then we must stop fighting
amongst ourselves ...

654
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:13,126
 ... and face that the price for it
may be dear.

655
01:01:13,711 --> 01:01:15,587
I, for one, would rather die ...

656
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:18,215
 ... than spend my life in hiding.

657
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:20,759
The sheriff calls us outlaws.

658
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:23,637
But I say we are free.

659
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:26,390
And one free man defending his home ...

660
01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:30,143
 ... is more powerful than 10 hired soldiers.

661
01:01:32,313 --> 01:01:34,773
The Crusades taught me that.

662
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:40,404
I will make you no promises save one.

663
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:46,159
That if you truly believe
in your hearts that you are free ...

664
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:49,037
 ... then I say we can win.

665
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:51,415
They got armor!

666
01:01:51,582 --> 01:01:53,625
They got armor, Bull?

667
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:56,962
Even this boy can be taught
to find the chinks in armor.

668
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:59,131
But we ain't got nothing to eat!

669
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:03,510
What do we need that the forest
cannot provide? We have food.

670
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:05,887
Wood for weapons.

671
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:08,223
We'll find safety and solace
in her trees.

672
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:14,271
Yeah, but what about our kin?
Sheriff's taken all they got too!

673
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:18,567
Then, by God, we take it back.

674
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:04,798
What's the meaning of this?

675
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:09,511
Milady. A woman of your beauty
has no need for such decorations.

676
01:04:10,304 --> 01:04:12,597
How dare you!

677
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:24,776
Please don't take that!
Don't take that!

678
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:30,282
- Please, sir! Those belong to our Lord.
- Now they belong to my lord sheriff!

679
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:45,297
Give it back.

680
01:04:46,674 --> 01:04:47,716
Good.

681
01:04:48,175 --> 01:04:53,555
Tell the sheriff for every harm he does these
people, I will visit it back on him tenfold.

682
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:04,774
Something vexes thee?

683
01:05:15,953 --> 01:05:19,289
- What the devil?
- 'Tis a hot day, my friend ...

684
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:21,791
 ... to burden your horse
with such a heavy purse.

685
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:24,085
The sheriff will hear of this!

686
01:05:28,507 --> 01:05:30,258
I truly hope so.

687
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:41,227
There you go, love.
Buy yourself a new sow.

688
01:05:41,395 --> 01:05:44,314
God bless you, Fanny.

689
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:46,066
And God bless Robin Hood!

690
01:05:49,111 --> 01:05:55,033
We reckon he's nicked 3 to 4 million
in the last five months, sire.

691
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:58,203
All right then, fine.
Raise the bounty on his head.

692
01:05:58,371 --> 01:06:00,038
Twenty-five thousand crowns.

693
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:04,876
Begging your pardon, it won't do no good
how much you raise it.

694
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:07,963
- Really, scribe, and why is that?
- Because, sire ...

695
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:11,716
 ... the poor, you see.
He gives them what he takes.

696
01:06:11,884 --> 01:06:14,970
So, well, sire, they love him.

697
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:20,225
Just a minute.

698
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:22,936
Robin Hood steals money
from my pocket ...

699
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:26,189
 ... forcing me to hurt the public ...

700
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:29,067
 ... and they love him for it?

701
01:06:29,568 --> 01:06:31,444
Yes.

702
01:06:32,571 --> 01:06:34,406
That's it then!

703
01:06:34,573 --> 01:06:37,117
Cancel the kitchen scraps
for lepers and orphans.

704
01:06:37,284 --> 01:06:40,120
No more merciful beheadings.

705
01:06:40,287 --> 01:06:42,497
And call off Christmas!

706
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:45,792
The treasury is empty.

707
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,169
All day and all night
people plague my door ...

708
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:51,923
 ... whining for tax relief and safe passage
through Sherwood Forest.

709
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:54,426
"We can't pay thee
what the highwayman's taken."

710
01:06:54,593 --> 01:06:57,095
It's the shortest route to London, sire!

711
01:06:57,263 --> 01:07:00,265
It's the only road to London,
you little ferret.

712
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:04,310
Sir Guy's patrols
have found nothing, sire?

713
01:07:04,478 --> 01:07:06,980
No camp. Nothing!

714
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:12,944
This hooded viper
simply slithers into the forest.

715
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:17,615
You, my room, 10:30 tonight.
You, 10:45.

716
01:07:17,783 --> 01:07:19,576
Bring a friend.

717
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:38,970
Tongue offends thee.

718
01:07:39,972 --> 01:07:42,932
- Whose?
- One who writes all.

719
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:51,107
- That horrible little scribe, his tongue?
- Cut it out.

720
01:08:20,721 --> 01:08:22,305
How many?

721
01:08:22,473 --> 01:08:23,890
Twenty.

722
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:25,600
Twenty?!

723
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:28,144
How many?

724
01:08:28,312 --> 01:08:30,188
Five.

725
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,650
- They can't count anyway.
- Come on.

726
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:35,902
Why scare them?

727
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:38,113
And they call me barbarian.

728
01:08:46,872 --> 01:08:48,748
Friar!

729
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:52,502
You shall find it more difficult to sing
with a sword in your gullet.

730
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:55,130
Yes, my lord.

731
01:08:57,591 --> 01:09:01,845
- Shut up and help me move this log!
- This isn't a log, it's a tree!

732
01:09:02,012 --> 01:09:04,097
Shut up! You're supposed to
be helping me!

733
01:09:04,265 --> 01:09:06,015
I'm supposed to be meeting a girl!

734
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:16,776
You men in front, after me.
The rest stay with the wagon!

735
01:09:19,864 --> 01:09:21,573
On to glory!

736
01:09:35,379 --> 01:09:38,631
Bastards. Come on. Find them!

737
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:13,458
Go!

738
01:10:22,968 --> 01:10:25,094
Welcome to Sherwood, friar!
Giddap!

739
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:53,498
Surrender your weapons!

740
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:57,710
Surrender your weapons,
and I give you my word you shall go free.

741
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:00,672
Don't do that!

742
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:04,050
What are you --?

743
01:11:21,026 --> 01:11:23,528
I'll be buggered!

744
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:27,198
This treasure had a purpose.
We must find out what.

745
01:11:42,923 --> 01:11:45,800
Good morning, my reverend friend.

746
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:49,637
You travel with poor company
when you travel with Nottingham's soldiers.

747
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:52,557
- Tax him!
- Tax him!

748
01:11:54,059 --> 01:11:58,438
I'm Robin of Locksley.
And my men are thirsty.

749
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:01,607
- That's right.
- Robin Hood!

750
01:12:02,693 --> 01:12:05,194
Lord bless me.

751
01:12:05,904 --> 01:12:09,282
I mistook you for common thieves!

752
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:11,159
Kindly let me pass, sir.

753
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:17,749
Surely the Lord has the charity to spare
a few barrels for good Christian men. Yes?

754
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:21,127
We have much to celebrate.

755
01:12:22,129 --> 01:12:25,506
Well, if you wish them to share
in the good Lord's brew ...

756
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:28,259
 ... you must best me for it!

757
01:12:33,807 --> 01:12:37,268
Confess, Robin Hood,
that Friar Tuck is a braver ...

758
01:12:37,436 --> 01:12:41,272
 ... holier and wiser man than thou art!

759
01:12:57,790 --> 01:13:01,292
He giveth and he taketh away.

760
01:13:06,632 --> 01:13:08,549
Do you yield?

761
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:14,972
I'd rather roast in hell.

762
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:19,602
Shoot him! Shoot him!

763
01:13:34,576 --> 01:13:38,079
I think the good friar's
taken us far enough.

764
01:13:39,164 --> 01:13:41,124
Well done, friar.

765
01:13:41,708 --> 01:13:44,961
Thank you, Lord,
for teaching me humility.

766
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:55,972
- Well, Tuck ...
- Thanks for the beer.

767
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:58,933
 ... are these not the meek of the earth?

768
01:13:59,184 --> 01:14:02,437
We're in need of an honest man
to minister to them.

769
01:14:03,021 --> 01:14:04,939
What say you, friar?

770
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:12,321
The Lord reveals himself
in mysterious ways.

771
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:16,367
- I accept.
- Good.

772
01:14:17,161 --> 01:14:18,953
You will not regret it.

773
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:21,497
Aye, but you may!

774
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:55,490
We were ambushed, cousin.

775
01:14:59,578 --> 01:15:04,499
Spanish steel. Much stronger
than our native blades.

776
01:15:07,252 --> 01:15:08,628
Any losses?

777
01:15:09,046 --> 01:15:10,671
Some.

778
01:15:14,092 --> 01:15:16,886
In truth, all of them.

779
01:15:17,054 --> 01:15:20,097
- And the gold?
- Taken.

780
01:15:21,433 --> 01:15:23,434
Robin Hood?

781
01:15:23,602 --> 01:15:26,979
They were woodsmen, cousin.

782
01:15:29,566 --> 01:15:31,484
Robin Hood.

783
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:34,278
I tried.

784
01:15:35,322 --> 01:15:37,657
- I tried.
- Cousin ... .

785
01:15:37,824 --> 01:15:40,243
- I tried. I tried.
- Cousin ...

786
01:15:40,410 --> 01:15:42,119
 ... we must be strong.

787
01:15:42,287 --> 01:15:45,790
We can't allow an outlaw
to make fools of us.

788
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:49,252
And I can't allow a lieutenant ...

789
01:15:49,419 --> 01:15:51,754
 ... to fail me.

790
01:16:05,477 --> 01:16:08,688
Well, at least I didn't use a spoon.

791
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:12,692
That's good steel.

792
01:16:24,496 --> 01:16:27,498
- Take the one on the left.
- Which one's left?

793
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:31,669
- Which one you taking?
- What do you mean?

794
01:16:31,837 --> 01:16:35,423
If you take the one on the left,
I'm taking the one on the right.

795
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:39,468
- Which one's the one on the right?
- The one next to the one on the ... .

796
01:16:39,970 --> 01:16:42,430
Bollocks. We'll just jump out
and grab them.

797
01:16:43,557 --> 01:16:44,807
- Now?
- Now!

798
01:16:47,894 --> 01:16:49,520
Donation, if you please.

799
01:16:49,688 --> 01:16:52,773
Donation? For what?

800
01:16:53,525 --> 01:16:54,942
What?

801
01:16:56,403 --> 01:16:59,196
- For passage through Sherwood.
- Very well.

802
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:02,241
Come and get it.

803
01:17:07,831 --> 01:17:10,374
You stunted shrub!
How dare you attack us?

804
01:17:10,542 --> 01:17:12,877
- It's me job, my lady.
- Job?

805
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:16,380
- And who is your employer?
- Robin Hood.

806
01:17:20,218 --> 01:17:22,720
I insist on seeing him at once.

807
01:17:24,765 --> 01:17:26,307
I'm trying to stop them!

808
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:31,062
- You cannot go down there!
- My lady, don't rush, you'll fall.

809
01:17:31,229 --> 01:17:34,940
- He's not expecting you!
- My lady's intrusion is simply tit for tat.

810
01:17:35,108 --> 01:17:37,401
- Out of the way, old traps!
- Don't "old traps" me!

811
01:17:37,569 --> 01:17:39,403
I told you, you can't go down there!

812
01:17:47,162 --> 01:17:50,247
- Ooh! Oh, I say.
- Cover your eyes.

813
01:17:50,415 --> 01:17:53,417
My lady, don't!

814
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:05,304
You could've said!

815
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:10,935
Robin! You got visitors!

816
01:18:15,107 --> 01:18:18,150
- It weren't my fault!
- Madam, you be careful there.

817
01:18:18,318 --> 01:18:22,988
- It was Much!
- Careful you don't slip.

818
01:18:26,451 --> 01:18:27,576
Hello.

819
01:18:29,996 --> 01:18:32,123
What are you doing here?

820
01:18:35,627 --> 01:18:38,170
Taking a lady's advice.

821
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:41,716
What happened to your eye, Bull?

822
01:18:41,883 --> 01:18:44,009
- We was set upon by 10 --
- Twelve!

823
01:18:44,177 --> 01:18:47,138
- Fifteen large, big lads!
- Oh, yeah?

824
01:18:47,305 --> 01:18:48,973
Yeah.

825
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:02,987
You've been busy.

826
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:06,198
- We have guests!
- Bring them down!

827
01:19:17,669 --> 01:19:19,712
It works.

828
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:21,589
Kind of.

829
01:19:22,257 --> 01:19:23,883
Of course it works.

830
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:27,386
Great shot!

831
01:19:28,263 --> 01:19:30,264
Take your time, now.

832
01:19:34,519 --> 01:19:38,272
That's good, Wulf.
But can you do it amidst distraction?

833
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:41,358
Can you make the shot when you must?

834
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:45,446
Show him, Wulf.

835
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:56,373
Can you?

836
01:19:56,541 --> 01:20:00,044
- Well, go on, then.
- It was a dirty trick.

837
01:20:01,004 --> 01:20:05,549
Aren't we all very serious?
Is his shirt coming off?

838
01:20:09,888 --> 01:20:12,890
Fair's fair. Come on, chaps.
Fair's fair.

839
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:28,864
Well done. Well done.

840
01:20:29,950 --> 01:20:34,245
This is grain, which any fool can eat ...

841
01:20:34,412 --> 01:20:39,625
 ... but for which the Lord intended
a more divine means of consumption.

842
01:20:39,793 --> 01:20:44,129
Let us give praise to our maker
and glory to his bounty ...

843
01:20:44,297 --> 01:20:46,048
 ... by learning about ...

844
01:20:46,216 --> 01:20:48,050
 ... beer.

845
01:20:54,891 --> 01:20:57,059
Did you bring me here to brag?

846
01:21:00,522 --> 01:21:02,857
This is blood money, Marian.

847
01:21:03,024 --> 01:21:06,402
It's intended to bribe King Richard's
enemies to unite against him.

848
01:21:07,654 --> 01:21:10,030
We intercepted it.

849
01:21:11,116 --> 01:21:13,367
- But who would --?
- Nottingham.

850
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:18,497
- He would not dare challenge the king.
- The king is not here to be challenged.

851
01:21:18,957 --> 01:21:21,667
While he's away,
he may lose his country.

852
01:21:25,297 --> 01:21:26,714
You thought ... .

853
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:30,301
You thought I was keeping it all,
didn't you?

854
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:32,803
Didn't you?

855
01:21:33,805 --> 01:21:35,139
Well, here.

856
01:21:35,557 --> 01:21:37,558
A contribution to your cause.

857
01:21:37,726 --> 01:21:39,977
- Keep it.
- This dagger would fetch a great price.

858
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:42,646
- Keep it.
- It's not dear to me.

859
01:21:42,814 --> 01:21:44,940
I mean, it is --
It's not.

860
01:21:46,818 --> 01:21:48,527
I'm saying everything wrong.
I'll ... .

861
01:21:51,448 --> 01:21:53,115
Cheers.

862
01:21:59,122 --> 01:22:01,624
How do I get down?

863
01:22:05,503 --> 01:22:07,296
Wait! Wait!

864
01:22:09,633 --> 01:22:12,092
We don't go that way anymore.

865
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:13,761
I'm happy to hear that.

866
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:15,512
Grab on.

867
01:22:18,683 --> 01:22:20,684
We have a rule here, you know.

868
01:22:20,852 --> 01:22:24,813
Once someone has seen the way
to our camp, that person cannot leave.

869
01:22:25,315 --> 01:22:27,775
There's too many lives at stake.

870
01:22:28,693 --> 01:22:31,654
That's why Sarah and l
asked to be blindfolded.

871
01:22:31,821 --> 01:22:33,614
Oh.

872
01:22:34,699 --> 01:22:37,451
Well, perhaps you might join us
for dinner?

873
01:22:38,036 --> 01:22:39,453
Perhaps.

874
01:22:57,847 --> 01:22:59,515
Salaam, little one.

875
01:22:59,683 --> 01:23:03,519
- Did God paint you?
- Did God paint me?

876
01:23:05,939 --> 01:23:08,816
- For certain.
- Why?

877
01:23:10,610 --> 01:23:12,778
Because ...

878
01:23:12,946 --> 01:23:15,406
 ... Allah loves wondrous variety.

879
01:23:17,617 --> 01:23:22,705
You see, that is why
your hair is brown and your --

880
01:23:22,872 --> 01:23:26,250
Keep thy heathen words
away from the ears of this innocent ...

881
01:23:26,418 --> 01:23:29,003
 ... or you'll answer to me.

882
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:31,755
You know nothing of our God.

883
01:23:34,092 --> 01:23:37,553
Is not Allah the god
of Abraham ...

884
01:23:37,721 --> 01:23:38,762
 ... as is your God?

885
01:23:39,222 --> 01:23:41,640
Don't trick me
with twists of the devil's tongue.

886
01:23:41,808 --> 01:23:43,600
Come, child, come.

887
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:53,027
How is it that a once arrogant
young nobleman ...

888
01:23:53,194 --> 01:23:57,031
 ... has found contentment living rough
with the salt of the earth?

889
01:23:57,198 --> 01:24:01,452
I've seen knights in armor panic
at the first hint of battle.

890
01:24:01,619 --> 01:24:06,582
And I've seen the lowliest unarmed squire
pull a spear from his own body ...

891
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:08,584
 ... to defend a dying horse.

892
01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:12,629
Nobility's not a birthright.

893
01:24:13,798 --> 01:24:15,758
It's defined by one's actions.

894
01:24:18,344 --> 01:24:20,888
It's interesting to hear you say that.

895
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:22,806
I didn't.

896
01:24:22,974 --> 01:24:24,683
My father did.

897
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:31,815
Did the holy quest
erase your hatred of him?

898
01:24:31,983 --> 01:24:33,609
I don't know.

899
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:40,741
All I know is that our last words
in this world were spoken in anger.

900
01:24:41,409 --> 01:24:44,036
I was lost after my mother died.

901
01:24:44,204 --> 01:24:48,165
My father too. And for a short time
he found comfort ...

902
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:51,835
 ... in the arms of another woman.
A peasant woman.

903
01:24:54,672 --> 01:24:56,757
I thought he was betraying
my mother's memory.

904
01:24:57,175 --> 01:24:59,009
So he gave her up?

905
01:25:00,804 --> 01:25:04,807
For the love of a 12-year-old boy
who would never forgive him.

906
01:25:10,688 --> 01:25:12,439
Anyway, who --?

907
01:25:13,399 --> 01:25:15,067
Who says I'm content?

908
01:25:15,235 --> 01:25:18,237
I have my plans for the future.

909
01:25:19,823 --> 01:25:24,493
- A grander scheme than this?
- No, a simpler one.

910
01:25:25,036 --> 01:25:28,080
A home, family ...

911
01:25:28,248 --> 01:25:29,665
 ... love.

912
01:25:29,833 --> 01:25:33,919
Men speak conveniently of love
when it serves their purpose.

913
01:25:34,087 --> 01:25:37,131
And when it doesn't,
'tis a burden to them.

914
01:25:37,298 --> 01:25:40,968
Robin of the Hood, prince of thieves.

915
01:25:42,095 --> 01:25:43,929
Is he capable of love?

916
01:25:48,643 --> 01:25:50,394
Father!

917
01:25:51,771 --> 01:25:53,397
Father!

918
01:25:54,482 --> 01:25:56,692
It's Mother, she's dying!

919
01:26:05,034 --> 01:26:07,202
Fanny.

920
01:26:07,370 --> 01:26:09,830
Your baby has not turned.

921
01:26:10,331 --> 01:26:13,500
It cannot be born without help.

922
01:26:14,335 --> 01:26:18,255
He's the devil's seed sent to lead us astray.
Don't listen to him. He'll kill her!

923
01:26:18,423 --> 01:26:20,591
If you do not listen to me ...

924
01:26:20,758 --> 01:26:23,594
 ... she will certainly die.
And the child.

925
01:26:27,015 --> 01:26:29,433
The good friar's done all he can.

926
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:33,228
I suggest you let the Moor try.

927
01:26:36,399 --> 01:26:40,277
- So be it.
- Then be it on your head! I warned you.

928
01:26:41,988 --> 01:26:45,866
Marian. Get me a needle,
thread, water.

929
01:26:46,284 --> 01:26:47,659
- And hurry.
- Yes.

930
01:26:47,827 --> 01:26:50,287
Come with me. Come, John!

931
01:26:52,999 --> 01:26:55,292
What are you going to do?

932
01:26:56,961 --> 01:26:59,254
I've seen it many times ...

933
01:26:59,422 --> 01:27:01,089
 ... with horses.

934
01:27:02,967 --> 01:27:04,927
With horses?

935
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:09,014
Bite down. Bite down, yes.

936
01:27:10,850 --> 01:27:12,768
Help me, sadiq.

937
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:17,356
Give me your arms.

938
01:27:19,150 --> 01:27:21,235
It will be all right.

939
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:33,330
I tell you, John,
the barbarian is killing her.

940
01:27:38,127 --> 01:27:40,587
- No, Father!
- Out of the way, boy!

941
01:27:42,173 --> 01:27:43,882
Quick, take him. Take him.

942
01:27:49,514 --> 01:27:54,017
Ooh. What is it? Ooh, ooh.

943
01:28:00,525 --> 01:28:03,360
Your son, milady.
There you are.

944
01:28:13,955 --> 01:28:16,581
You truly are a great one.

945
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:20,711
My son!

946
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:25,966
Look at the lovely little baby.
Isn't he wonderful?

947
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:37,853
Today the Lord has taught me
a fine lesson.

948
01:28:38,021 --> 01:28:41,690
That though I may think I am godly,
I know I am not worldly.

949
01:28:41,858 --> 01:28:44,318
Please. Please.

950
01:28:48,698 --> 01:28:53,118
Come, my barbarian friend, let's open
a barrel and try to save each other's souls.

951
01:28:53,286 --> 01:28:58,123
- Alas, I am not permitted.
- Well, fine then. You talk, I'll drink.

952
01:29:05,506 --> 01:29:09,593
- Milady!
- Sarah?

953
01:29:11,763 --> 01:29:13,430
May I have this dance?

954
01:29:13,598 --> 01:29:15,974
This lady is spoken for.

955
01:29:58,518 --> 01:30:00,394
Why this way?

956
01:30:01,062 --> 01:30:05,107
So you cannot find the way back
or be forced to tell others the way.

957
01:30:08,861 --> 01:30:11,405
It was good to see you again, Marian.

958
01:30:12,323 --> 01:30:14,241
It was good to be seen.

959
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:18,453
I have two favors to ask of you.

960
01:30:20,456 --> 01:30:22,082
One.

961
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:26,294
Take Duncan with you. I fear for his health
with what may lie ahead.

962
01:30:27,588 --> 01:30:30,215
Besides, I grow tired of his bellyaching.

963
01:30:30,383 --> 01:30:32,509
You wish me to leave, Master Robin?

964
01:30:32,677 --> 01:30:34,469
Old friend, listen to me.

965
01:30:35,179 --> 01:30:38,181
Can you take Lady Marian safely home?

966
01:30:38,349 --> 01:30:40,225
I fear for her safety.

967
01:30:40,393 --> 01:30:42,894
- Of course, sire.
- Good.

968
01:30:43,062 --> 01:30:45,021
Bull.

969
01:30:51,946 --> 01:30:54,948
- And two?
- Yes, two.

970
01:30:57,910 --> 01:31:00,245
You're King Richard's cousin.

971
01:31:01,539 --> 01:31:04,583
You can get word to him
of Nottingham's plan.

972
01:31:05,376 --> 01:31:07,294
He would believe you.

973
01:31:07,962 --> 01:31:11,381
If the sheriff found out,
I could lose all that I have.

974
01:31:13,092 --> 01:31:15,051
That's true.

975
01:31:16,429 --> 01:31:18,972
But will you do it for your king?

976
01:31:19,432 --> 01:31:20,474
No.

977
01:31:23,853 --> 01:31:25,979
I'll do it for you.

978
01:31:45,374 --> 01:31:47,751
He fancies you, my lady.

979
01:31:49,754 --> 01:31:53,882
I am blind, but some things
I can still see.

980
01:32:11,943 --> 01:32:15,529
In 10 days' time, the barons are coming.

981
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:18,823
Robin Hood has stolen what I was to pay
for their allegiance.

982
01:32:19,242 --> 01:32:23,537
And I am surrounded by fools
who do not realize my obligations.

983
01:32:24,956 --> 01:32:26,665
Tell me, Mortianna ...

984
01:32:27,708 --> 01:32:29,251
 ... am I thwarted?

985
01:32:51,566 --> 01:32:54,359
Recruit the beasts that share our god.

986
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:58,113
Animals?

987
01:32:58,281 --> 01:33:01,533
- From the North.
- You mean Celts.

988
01:33:01,701 --> 01:33:04,160
They drink the blood of their dead.

989
01:33:04,328 --> 01:33:06,830
Yoke their strength.

990
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:12,043
Hired thugs.

991
01:33:15,047 --> 01:33:17,173
Brilliant.

992
01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:24,472
Put thine own issue on the throne.

993
01:33:25,725 --> 01:33:27,434
A child? How?

994
01:33:27,727 --> 01:33:29,978
Ally with royal blood.

995
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:33,356
Who?

996
01:33:47,997 --> 01:33:51,249
It's a personal matter, my lord.
But one of vital importance.

997
01:33:51,417 --> 01:33:54,044
I understand, my dear lady.

998
01:33:54,629 --> 01:33:57,047
This is my most trusted emissary.

999
01:33:57,214 --> 01:34:01,718
You must travel to France immediately and
put that directly in the hands of the king.

1000
01:34:01,886 --> 01:34:04,220
My lady in waiting shall accompany you.

1001
01:34:04,388 --> 01:34:08,558
My dear, I could not vouch
for her safety.

1002
01:34:08,726 --> 01:34:10,644
The journey is fraught with danger.

1003
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:12,354
I appreciate your concern ...

1004
01:34:12,521 --> 01:34:15,732
 ... but Sarah's an accomplished rider,
and I insist she go along.

1005
01:34:17,026 --> 01:34:18,735
As you wish.

1006
01:34:32,708 --> 01:34:34,042
What is wrong?

1007
01:34:34,210 --> 01:34:37,337
My horse is favoring his foreleg.

1008
01:35:26,637 --> 01:35:27,679
What's this?

1009
01:35:30,725 --> 01:35:35,228
- An appetizer.
- You promised us wagons of gold.

1010
01:35:36,731 --> 01:35:40,150
Well, there are greater things than gold.

1011
01:35:40,317 --> 01:35:44,904
More land and power
than you have ever dreamed of.

1012
01:35:46,157 --> 01:35:48,199
When I rule this land ...

1013
01:35:48,367 --> 01:35:51,870
 ... it'll be divided between
just the seven of us in this room.

1014
01:35:52,037 --> 01:35:54,706
You get Cornwall,
you can have Wales ...

1015
01:35:54,874 --> 01:35:57,000
 ... and Scotland is all yours.

1016
01:35:58,169 --> 01:36:00,420
You recruit us to treason ...

1017
01:36:00,588 --> 01:36:03,631
 ... and yet you cannot even get gold
through your own forest.

1018
01:36:03,799 --> 01:36:09,721
Why risk life and limb for a man who cannot
even snare the bandit who marked his face?

1019
01:36:09,889 --> 01:36:12,140
Why, indeed?

1020
01:36:13,017 --> 01:36:14,934
That's a good point, my lord.

1021
01:36:15,102 --> 01:36:20,148
How can I control England
when I cannot even control my own county?

1022
01:36:21,525 --> 01:36:24,444
I'm bringing in a little help.

1023
01:36:25,070 --> 01:36:26,946
Audred!

1024
01:36:31,911 --> 01:36:33,953
By God.

1025
01:36:34,121 --> 01:36:36,873
You'd ally us with the Celts?

1026
01:36:37,041 --> 01:36:40,084
What can these mercenaries do
that we cannot?

1027
01:37:10,825 --> 01:37:12,992
Very impressive.

1028
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:15,411
All right, my lord sheriff ...

1029
01:37:15,579 --> 01:37:19,958
 ... but you must wed royal kin
before we act.

1030
01:37:20,125 --> 01:37:22,794
Then your claim to the throne
will be ...

1031
01:37:24,922 --> 01:37:26,589
 ... legitimate.

1032
01:37:26,757 --> 01:37:29,634
I'm as good as engaged.

1033
01:37:50,656 --> 01:37:52,949
Duncan, is that you?

1034
01:37:56,954 --> 01:37:58,538
Hello?

1035
01:38:02,835 --> 01:38:04,544
Rebecca?

1036
01:38:07,506 --> 01:38:09,340
Ah! God!

1037
01:38:09,884 --> 01:38:12,093
Nicodemus. Go.

1038
01:38:12,261 --> 01:38:13,511
Find mice.

1039
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:15,805
- Ha-ha!
- Ah!

1040
01:38:17,641 --> 01:38:21,019
I've never seen the breasts
of a noblewoman.

1041
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:37,160
- Pardon, my lady, we couldn't hold them!
- Someone wants a word with you.

1042
01:38:42,458 --> 01:38:45,835
- No!
- That's it, sir. That's all of them.

1043
01:39:02,186 --> 01:39:03,853
Easy.

1044
01:39:07,983 --> 01:39:11,361
Tonight I need your eyes, old friend.

1045
01:39:56,782 --> 01:40:00,493
Robin! The warning arrow!

1046
01:40:02,079 --> 01:40:05,665
All is well! It's Duncan!

1047
01:40:08,085 --> 01:40:11,004
Duncan. Duncan.

1048
01:40:14,591 --> 01:40:15,925
What happened?

1049
01:40:16,093 --> 01:40:18,594
I found you, Robin.
Thank God, I did it.

1050
01:40:18,971 --> 01:40:22,515
- Nottingham's men attacked us.
- Marian?

1051
01:40:22,850 --> 01:40:24,851
They took her.

1052
01:40:33,777 --> 01:40:35,361
What is it?

1053
01:40:36,572 --> 01:40:38,781
Over there! Look!

1054
01:40:39,324 --> 01:40:41,159
On the hill!

1055
01:41:01,972 --> 01:41:03,598
Celts! God help us!

1056
01:41:03,766 --> 01:41:05,641
Allah, be merciful.

1057
01:41:06,143 --> 01:41:09,645
To the trees!
To the trees!

1058
01:41:10,898 --> 01:41:12,899
Celts! They're coming!

1059
01:41:13,067 --> 01:41:16,027
Poor old fool led them straight to us.

1060
01:41:17,738 --> 01:41:19,405
Hide in the trees!

1061
01:41:20,866 --> 01:41:22,658
Get me prisoners.

1062
01:41:35,422 --> 01:41:38,007
Children! Come to me!

1063
01:41:55,734 --> 01:41:57,610
Daddy!

1064
01:43:53,727 --> 01:43:55,144
My God.

1065
01:44:08,784 --> 01:44:10,201
Save us!

1066
01:44:23,507 --> 01:44:25,383
Come! Hurry!

1067
01:44:26,885 --> 01:44:28,678
Save yourselves!

1068
01:44:32,557 --> 01:44:35,101
We've gotta go, Robin!
We go now!

1069
01:44:39,231 --> 01:44:40,606
Move!

1070
01:44:51,368 --> 01:44:53,995
This way, my lambs.
Come on!

1071
01:44:57,374 --> 01:44:59,166
- Got you!
- Hold or I fire!

1072
01:45:03,547 --> 01:45:05,881
It's gold! Gold!

1073
01:45:10,721 --> 01:45:12,430
Fanny!

1074
01:45:14,725 --> 01:45:16,642
Fanny!

1075
01:45:19,313 --> 01:45:21,439
- John!
- Come on, girl!

1076
01:45:46,882 --> 01:45:48,883
Fanny!

1077
01:45:49,051 --> 01:45:51,093
Go! Save yourself, John!

1078
01:45:51,261 --> 01:45:54,263
No, Fanny, I won't leave you!

1079
01:45:54,598 --> 01:45:56,515
Go on, John!

1080
01:45:56,767 --> 01:45:58,893
Never!

1081
01:46:00,270 --> 01:46:01,520
Oh, God!

1082
01:46:12,616 --> 01:46:14,200
- Okay.
- Oh, thank God.

1083
01:46:17,537 --> 01:46:20,498
- John, you'll have to catch her!
- Come on!

1084
01:46:28,632 --> 01:46:30,549
I got you, girl!

1085
01:46:37,474 --> 01:46:40,059
- Quick! Quick!
- Robin!

1086
01:46:48,652 --> 01:46:50,194
- Come on!
- Come on!

1087
01:46:54,199 --> 01:46:55,825
- Get over here!
- Go on!

1088
01:46:56,243 --> 01:46:58,035
Come on!

1089
01:46:58,412 --> 01:47:01,831
Don't wait for me!
John, go on!

1090
01:47:01,998 --> 01:47:03,499
Hurry!

1091
01:47:30,902 --> 01:47:32,736
Corpus Christi.

1092
01:47:32,904 --> 01:47:34,363
Amen.

1093
01:47:52,132 --> 01:47:54,049
My Lady Marian.

1094
01:47:55,635 --> 01:47:58,804
By what right do you keep me prisoner?

1095
01:47:58,972 --> 01:48:02,016
You misunderstand my intentions.

1096
01:48:02,184 --> 01:48:04,518
You've been brought here
for your own protection.

1097
01:48:06,646 --> 01:48:10,524
- Protection from whom?
- From yourself.

1098
01:48:11,234 --> 01:48:14,945
It seems that you've been
consorting with outlaws.

1099
01:48:17,157 --> 01:48:19,867
Where do you hear such lies?

1100
01:48:20,660 --> 01:48:23,329
By your own hand, my lady.

1101
01:48:28,585 --> 01:48:30,920
I'm sorry, my child.

1102
01:48:31,922 --> 01:48:34,798
I feared you were being led astray.

1103
01:48:37,594 --> 01:48:39,178
Come.

1104
01:48:48,063 --> 01:48:50,189
It's over.

1105
01:48:50,690 --> 01:48:54,527
Today I return justice to this land.

1106
01:48:55,779 --> 01:49:00,074
I shall have to hang the ringleaders,
of course, but I would like to be generous ...

1107
01:49:00,242 --> 01:49:04,453
 ... and give you the lives of the woodsmen
and their families.

1108
01:49:05,121 --> 01:49:06,664
The children!

1109
01:49:07,958 --> 01:49:09,458
And, of course ...

1110
01:49:09,626 --> 01:49:13,379
 ... of your traitorous lady in waiting.
- Get in there!

1111
01:49:15,215 --> 01:49:17,925
As a wedding gift.

1112
01:49:22,138 --> 01:49:26,141
And just who am I supposed to marry?

1113
01:49:31,314 --> 01:49:34,608
Search your heart, my child.

1114
01:49:34,776 --> 01:49:38,070
Why not a union
with the house of Nottingham ...

1115
01:49:38,238 --> 01:49:40,698
 ... and heal the wounds in our land?

1116
01:49:40,865 --> 01:49:44,076
There is only one man who can heal
the wounds of this land.

1117
01:49:44,244 --> 01:49:46,078
Robin Hood.

1118
01:49:58,842 --> 01:50:00,759
I'm truly sorry, my lady.

1119
01:50:00,927 --> 01:50:04,888
He wasted his life.
How many more lives would you waste?

1120
01:50:15,734 --> 01:50:17,943
What a beautiful child.

1121
01:50:21,698 --> 01:50:23,824
So young.

1122
01:50:23,992 --> 01:50:30,205
So alive, so unaware
of how precarious life can be.

1123
01:50:36,338 --> 01:50:39,798
I had a very sad childhood.
I'll tell you about it sometime.

1124
01:50:39,966 --> 01:50:44,345
I never knew my parents.
It's amazing I'm sane.

1125
01:50:53,563 --> 01:50:57,691
Our bonding would allow these children
to grow up as my allies.

1126
01:50:58,234 --> 01:51:00,110
You understand ...

1127
01:51:00,278 --> 01:51:05,074
 ... I cannot allow them
to grow up as my enemies.

1128
01:51:07,369 --> 01:51:09,662
I have no choice.

1129
01:51:11,081 --> 01:51:13,082
That's true.

1130
01:51:52,747 --> 01:51:54,373
Look!

1131
01:51:59,546 --> 01:52:01,463
Christian.

1132
01:52:26,030 --> 01:52:27,698
Leave him be!

1133
01:52:35,999 --> 01:52:38,500
Sorry to keep you hanging about.

1134
01:52:42,881 --> 01:52:47,176
Would you prefer pain
or death?

1135
01:52:48,344 --> 01:52:49,970
Death.

1136
01:52:50,138 --> 01:52:52,181
Torture him.

1137
01:52:53,266 --> 01:52:57,144
What about you?
Pain or death?

1138
01:52:57,312 --> 01:52:58,854
Pain.

1139
01:52:59,022 --> 01:53:01,440
Torture him. You see?

1140
01:53:01,608 --> 01:53:04,610
- It makes no difference.
- Spare me.

1141
01:53:06,362 --> 01:53:10,491
Will you keep the noise down, please?!

1142
01:53:10,658 --> 01:53:16,163
Now, I have heard that Robin Hood
may still be alive.

1143
01:53:17,207 --> 01:53:21,043
Either tell me where he may be hiding ...

1144
01:53:21,419 --> 01:53:24,755
 ... or you'll all be hanged, and we'll
catch him anyway and do the same to him.

1145
01:53:24,923 --> 01:53:27,382
- I'd love to kill him for you.
- Will, no!

1146
01:53:31,554 --> 01:53:34,473
So he is alive, then?

1147
01:53:34,641 --> 01:53:36,600
I'm not really sure.

1148
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:39,728
Then why would I need you?

1149
01:53:40,563 --> 01:53:44,650
Because, my lord, if he is alive
I can get close to him.

1150
01:53:44,818 --> 01:53:47,361
I'm one of his men.
He would never suspect me.

1151
01:53:47,529 --> 01:53:50,113
- He knows you always hated him, traitor!
- Shut up!

1152
01:53:51,074 --> 01:53:54,576
He's a trusting fool.
And if he doesn't believe me, he'll kill me ...

1153
01:53:54,744 --> 01:53:57,246
 ... then you've lost nothing.

1154
01:53:59,082 --> 01:54:01,625
If you fail ...

1155
01:54:02,335 --> 01:54:06,755
 ... I will personally remove
your lying tongue.

1156
01:54:09,008 --> 01:54:11,426
And if I succeed ...

1157
01:54:11,594 --> 01:54:15,347
 ... I want my freedom
and the bounty on his head.

1158
01:54:15,515 --> 01:54:17,766
The lash, I think.

1159
01:54:17,934 --> 01:54:21,103
Sorry about that.
It'll make it more convincing.

1160
01:54:54,679 --> 01:54:57,848
- My pride brought us to this.
- No, sadiq.

1161
01:54:58,766 --> 01:55:02,102
It was you who gave pride
to these people.

1162
01:55:03,938 --> 01:55:05,814
I was a fool.

1163
01:55:07,317 --> 01:55:09,818
I was a fool to let him leave ...

1164
01:55:10,403 --> 01:55:13,572
 ... to believe I planned it all so perfectly.

1165
01:55:16,659 --> 01:55:19,161
I once heard a wise man say:

1166
01:55:20,413 --> 01:55:23,665
There are no perfect men
in this world ...

1167
01:55:24,542 --> 01:55:26,126
 ... only perfect intentions.

1168
01:55:31,925 --> 01:55:34,760
You were an honor
to your countrymen today, Azeem.

1169
01:55:37,347 --> 01:55:40,265
You fought better
than 20 English knights.

1170
01:56:09,879 --> 01:56:11,296
Will!

1171
01:56:12,256 --> 01:56:15,509
- I thought you were taken.
- I was.

1172
01:56:15,677 --> 01:56:17,386
How did you escape?

1173
01:56:17,553 --> 01:56:19,096
Traitor!

1174
01:56:19,263 --> 01:56:21,682
I'll wring your scrawny neck!

1175
01:56:21,849 --> 01:56:23,308
You get in there!
Get in there!

1176
01:56:23,476 --> 01:56:27,521
Nobody escapes the sheriff,
not unless he's lining his pockets.

1177
01:56:27,689 --> 01:56:29,606
Where are the others?

1178
01:56:29,774 --> 01:56:32,359
- Where's my son?!
- He'll have his blade in your side!

1179
01:56:32,527 --> 01:56:35,821
I'll have your guts for garters,
you little toad!

1180
01:56:39,951 --> 01:56:41,910
- Bugger me!
- God!

1181
01:56:42,412 --> 01:56:44,246
Let him speak.

1182
01:56:46,499 --> 01:56:48,917
I bring a message ...

1183
01:56:49,877 --> 01:56:51,920
 ... from Nottingham.

1184
01:56:52,422 --> 01:56:55,465
Our men are to be hung
in the square at high noon tomorrow.

1185
01:56:55,633 --> 01:56:57,843
And what about my boy?

1186
01:56:58,011 --> 01:57:00,554
The boy too. Ten men in all.

1187
01:57:02,015 --> 01:57:06,852
The hangings are to be part
of the celebration for the sheriff's marriage.

1188
01:57:07,020 --> 01:57:09,354
Marriage? To who?

1189
01:57:10,690 --> 01:57:12,691
Lady Marian.

1190
01:57:12,859 --> 01:57:15,444
He takes a bride of royal blood.

1191
01:57:17,363 --> 01:57:19,156
And with King Richard gone ...

1192
01:57:19,323 --> 01:57:21,825
 ... he'll be after the bloody throne.

1193
01:57:22,368 --> 01:57:26,788
You were to use this news to get
close to me and then kill me, right, Will?

1194
01:57:29,125 --> 01:57:33,378
- What are your intentions?
- That depends on you, Locksley.

1195
01:57:34,547 --> 01:57:37,507
I've never trusted you,
that's no secret.

1196
01:57:37,675 --> 01:57:40,135
What I wanna know is,
are you gonna finish what you started?

1197
01:57:40,470 --> 01:57:44,890
I want to know if he's gonna run like
the spoiled rich boy I always took him for.

1198
01:57:47,310 --> 01:57:51,146
Did I wrong you in another life,
Will Scarlett?

1199
01:57:52,148 --> 01:57:55,859
Where does this intolerable hatred for me
come from?

1200
01:58:07,205 --> 01:58:08,914
From knowing ...

1201
01:58:09,082 --> 01:58:12,334
 ... that our father loved you
more than me.

1202
01:58:14,378 --> 01:58:16,213
Our father?

1203
01:58:16,380 --> 01:58:18,924
We are brothers, Robin of Locksley.

1204
01:58:19,092 --> 01:58:23,762
I am the son of the woman who replaced
your dead mother for a time!

1205
01:58:23,930 --> 01:58:26,014
- Your anger drove them apart!
- It's a lie!

1206
01:58:26,182 --> 01:58:29,434
It's not a lie!
You ruined my life!

1207
01:58:42,031 --> 01:58:46,118
I have more reason to hate you
than anyone.

1208
01:58:46,285 --> 01:58:49,746
But I found myself daring
to believe in you.

1209
01:58:50,456 --> 01:58:52,040
What I wanna know, brother ...

1210
01:58:52,625 --> 01:58:56,294
 ... is will you stay with us
and finish what you've started?

1211
01:59:01,592 --> 01:59:03,927
I have a brother?

1212
01:59:07,265 --> 01:59:09,432
I have a brother.

1213
01:59:12,937 --> 01:59:15,355
I will make my stand with you.

1214
01:59:15,523 --> 01:59:17,649
Side by side.

1215
01:59:17,817 --> 01:59:19,401
To the end.

1216
01:59:21,988 --> 01:59:24,072
To the end!

1217
01:59:25,908 --> 01:59:28,076
We're all bloody in.

1218
01:59:28,244 --> 01:59:29,703
Daft buggers.

1219
01:59:34,208 --> 01:59:35,667
We finish this.

1220
02:00:03,613 --> 02:00:07,157
Overwhelmed with happiness,
thank you for asking.

1221
02:00:07,325 --> 02:00:10,410
Yes, all is well.
I got all my money back ...

1222
02:00:10,578 --> 02:00:16,291
 ... Robin Hood's probably dead,
and I'm gonna be king, all as predicted.

1223
02:00:20,504 --> 02:00:22,297
Now, I want you to tell the hangman ...

1224
02:00:22,465 --> 02:00:25,675
 ... I don't want to see
any broken necks in the morning.

1225
02:00:25,843 --> 02:00:30,347
I wanna see some dancing!

1226
02:00:31,724 --> 02:00:34,893
Don't touch that!

1227
02:00:35,353 --> 02:00:38,230
I can do that myself.

1228
02:00:39,523 --> 02:00:43,151
Thank you very much.

1229
02:01:25,695 --> 02:01:28,446
Have you been spying on me,
you little insect?

1230
02:01:32,201 --> 02:01:36,037
Well, who else would have made a --?

1231
02:01:54,056 --> 02:01:56,516
Where are you?

1232
02:02:01,731 --> 02:02:04,357
You come early.
The signs have not aligned yet.

1233
02:02:04,775 --> 02:02:07,777
And you can stop all that,
you old fake!

1234
02:02:08,654 --> 02:02:11,406
I will try for thee anyway.

1235
02:02:16,412 --> 02:02:20,123
The union. The blood of the lion
and the house of Nottingham ...

1236
02:02:20,291 --> 02:02:22,417
 ... new power, new soul.

1237
02:02:22,585 --> 02:02:25,337
I found the hole!

1238
02:02:25,504 --> 02:02:28,673
You dare to spy on me?

1239
02:02:28,841 --> 02:02:31,760
I want the truth.

1240
02:02:33,012 --> 02:02:34,596
Why?

1241
02:02:34,764 --> 02:02:37,891
Truth has never served you before.

1242
02:02:38,059 --> 02:02:42,270
Truth didn't put Nottingham
where he is today.

1243
02:02:42,438 --> 02:02:43,438
Mortianna did.

1244
02:02:43,606 --> 02:02:47,442
You freakish imp, I despise you.

1245
02:02:47,610 --> 02:02:49,486
After the wedding,
you're on the streets.

1246
02:02:49,653 --> 02:02:52,072
The people will rip out
your heart and burn it!

1247
02:02:52,239 --> 02:02:55,867
Without me, you're nothing.

1248
02:02:57,286 --> 02:03:01,039
You're straw. A fleabite.
A speck.

1249
02:03:03,167 --> 02:03:06,002
I birthed you from this body.

1250
02:03:06,170 --> 02:03:08,963
I stole a babe in this very castle
and killed it ...

1251
02:03:09,131 --> 02:03:13,134
 ... so that you might rise in its place.

1252
02:03:14,929 --> 02:03:17,097
You're my son.

1253
02:03:20,393 --> 02:03:22,811
You despise me?

1254
02:03:23,729 --> 02:03:26,815
You are me.

1255
02:03:26,982 --> 02:03:29,692
You know, from your empty soul,
that is the truth.

1256
02:03:31,362 --> 02:03:36,282
All my life, I've been a freak.

1257
02:03:36,450 --> 02:03:40,161
But when you stud the Lady Marian ...

1258
02:03:40,329 --> 02:03:43,957
 ... my grandchild takes the throne.
My blood.

1259
02:03:44,125 --> 02:03:49,212
This twisted seed will rule through him.

1260
02:03:49,380 --> 02:03:52,841
We'll see who's freakish then.

1261
02:04:27,626 --> 02:04:30,211
- Damn!
- What was that?

1262
02:04:30,963 --> 02:04:33,047
Truly, you are a wizard.

1263
02:04:33,215 --> 02:04:35,842
The mystery is in the black powder.

1264
02:04:36,010 --> 02:04:38,720
Surely the Lord will grant us victory.

1265
02:04:40,097 --> 02:04:41,556
- Bull?
- Yeah.

1266
02:04:41,724 --> 02:04:44,434
Position by the gate
to cut off reinforcements.

1267
02:04:44,602 --> 02:04:47,729
John, you sit on this wall
to protect our escape.

1268
02:04:47,897 --> 02:04:50,648
I will conceal myself here,
below the scaffold ...

1269
02:04:50,816 --> 02:04:53,943
 ... to cut our men from their nooses
at the signal.

1270
02:04:54,111 --> 02:04:56,446
I'll do that. You have to cover us
with your bow.

1271
02:04:56,614 --> 02:04:58,406
It's too dangerous, Will.

1272
02:04:58,574 --> 02:05:00,283
So is your aim.

1273
02:05:02,912 --> 02:05:05,914
Whatever Azeem is concocting,
we must each be in place for it.

1274
02:05:06,081 --> 02:05:09,292
Now, our success depends
on total concert.

1275
02:05:09,460 --> 02:05:12,378
- We may be only six men --
- Seven.

1276
02:05:12,546 --> 02:05:14,547
What are you doing?
Where's the little ones?

1277
02:05:14,715 --> 02:05:16,424
Safe with my mother.

1278
02:05:16,592 --> 02:05:18,760
You gone bleeding cracked?
You'd get hurt.

1279
02:05:18,969 --> 02:05:22,180
I've had eight babies.
Don't talk to me about getting hurt.

1280
02:05:22,348 --> 02:05:25,350
I'm not just gonna sit here
and let one of them die.

1281
02:05:25,518 --> 02:05:28,937
You should be bloody well minding
the other seven.

1282
02:05:29,104 --> 02:05:31,022
Tell her, Rob.

1283
02:05:34,985 --> 02:05:36,778
Fanny ...

1284
02:05:36,946 --> 02:05:39,531
 ... you will take position here.

1285
02:05:52,461 --> 02:06:00,969
No blades, no bows.
Leave your weapons here.

1286
02:06:01,303 --> 02:06:04,764
No blades, no bows.
No blades.

1287
02:06:05,391 --> 02:06:07,308
What have you got there, Father?

1288
02:06:07,476 --> 02:06:11,729
The Lord's finest brew
for the good sheriff's fighting men.

1289
02:06:11,897 --> 02:06:14,482
It has a mighty kick.

1290
02:06:18,153 --> 02:06:20,405
No blades, no bows.

1291
02:06:31,875 --> 02:06:34,419
- Don't anger him.
- He is a Celt.

1292
02:06:38,841 --> 02:06:42,510
Psst. John. John!

1293
02:07:15,085 --> 02:07:16,669
Hey, you.

1294
02:07:17,713 --> 02:07:21,007
- Do I know you?
- Please, sir, don't hurt me.

1295
02:07:21,175 --> 02:07:23,051
Oh, my God, you stink.

1296
02:07:23,218 --> 02:07:27,889
- Pardon my blindness. I'm always falling --
- Get out of here!

1297
02:07:28,515 --> 02:07:32,393
- Thank you, sir.
- Careful, friar.

1298
02:07:34,772 --> 02:07:36,397
What are you doing?

1299
02:07:36,565 --> 02:07:40,985
Distributing libations for the celebration
of the sheriff's nuptials.

1300
02:07:41,153 --> 02:07:44,739
- Why, is something amiss?
- Yeah, you are. Get this out of here!

1301
02:07:44,907 --> 02:07:49,077
Caesar has spoken, my leprous friend.
We shall collect our offerings and depart.

1302
02:07:49,244 --> 02:07:53,581
- Is this your finger?
- Leper, what? Get this cart out of here!

1303
02:07:53,749 --> 02:07:57,502
Leaving bits and pieces of himself
all over England.

1304
02:08:05,594 --> 02:08:07,345
What are you doing here?

1305
02:08:07,513 --> 02:08:10,515
I ain't doing no harm.
I likes a good hanging, I do.

1306
02:08:10,683 --> 02:08:14,227
- What's in this bundle?
- That's firewood.

1307
02:08:18,607 --> 02:08:19,941
Hello, my lover.

1308
02:08:27,116 --> 02:08:30,284
Make way for the Lord's work!
Make way, do you hear?

1309
02:08:30,452 --> 02:08:31,786
Make way for the Lord's work!

1310
02:08:31,954 --> 02:08:35,623
A benediction for these poor bastards
who are about to stretch.

1311
02:08:36,291 --> 02:08:38,668
God, receive them in thy mercy ...

1312
02:08:38,836 --> 02:08:42,547
 ... and show them the love
that they do so richly deserve.

1313
02:08:44,842 --> 02:08:48,136
Hey! Nothing there but trouble, boy.

1314
02:09:07,823 --> 02:09:11,284
That's a little inappropriate,
don't you think?

1315
02:09:12,244 --> 02:09:15,288
No more than your wedding present.

1316
02:09:18,584 --> 02:09:20,501
Bring them out!

1317
02:09:31,472 --> 02:09:33,931
Get your hands off me, you dog.

1318
02:09:54,161 --> 02:09:59,040
-- and suffer knowing the lord
and his ministers are watching over you.

1319
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:43,709
Make way!

1320
02:10:56,056 --> 02:10:57,932
Traitor! Traitor!

1321
02:11:07,317 --> 02:11:09,318
What's going on?

1322
02:11:11,363 --> 02:11:12,822
Bring him here!

1323
02:11:14,283 --> 02:11:16,909
- I'll kill you!
- What do I do?

1324
02:11:25,377 --> 02:11:27,795
Oh, the turncoat.

1325
02:11:27,963 --> 02:11:29,922
Did you succeed?

1326
02:11:30,090 --> 02:11:33,467
Well, I found his lair ...

1327
02:11:35,012 --> 02:11:37,096
 ... but he was already dead.

1328
02:11:37,264 --> 02:11:40,474
You sure?
You saw Hood's body?

1329
02:11:41,310 --> 02:11:43,102
No.

1330
02:11:43,270 --> 02:11:45,813
I saw a grave.

1331
02:11:46,148 --> 02:11:48,232
We found this on him.

1332
02:11:52,154 --> 02:11:54,405
String him up with the others.

1333
02:11:58,577 --> 02:12:00,161
Put me down! Let go!

1334
02:12:04,666 --> 02:12:05,666
Let me go!

1335
02:12:10,756 --> 02:12:13,466
- Leave him! He's only a boy.
- Shut up!

1336
02:12:14,468 --> 02:12:17,762
Bastard!
You all right?

1337
02:12:18,680 --> 02:12:20,348
Now, Robin?

1338
02:12:35,656 --> 02:12:38,824
My lord, it appears there's no more room!

1339
02:12:39,368 --> 02:12:42,995
- I'm afraid I'll have to respectfully decline!
- Come on, you. Down!

1340
02:12:44,122 --> 02:12:45,164
Down.

1341
02:12:47,751 --> 02:12:50,127
Come on, move it. Hold your tongue!

1342
02:12:52,881 --> 02:12:56,133
There's always room for one more.

1343
02:13:29,543 --> 02:13:31,252
- No!
- That's my son!

1344
02:13:32,671 --> 02:13:34,505
I'm coming, Wulf!

1345
02:13:34,673 --> 02:13:36,173
My boy!

1346
02:14:07,789 --> 02:14:11,459
- Locksley.
- Robin!

1347
02:14:42,365 --> 02:14:44,992
Get some troops in here!

1348
02:14:54,503 --> 02:14:57,171
What are you waiting for?
Get on with it!

1349
02:15:09,267 --> 02:15:10,559
Help!

1350
02:15:46,638 --> 02:15:48,889
- Wulf!
- Father!

1351
02:15:50,058 --> 02:15:51,225
Oh, thank God.

1352
02:15:53,478 --> 02:15:56,230
Come on, you milksops!

1353
02:15:56,398 --> 02:15:58,691
- Fight your way free.
- Look out!

1354
02:16:05,699 --> 02:16:07,199
This way! To the wall!

1355
02:16:07,701 --> 02:16:11,745
My lord sheriff,
is this your idea of control?!

1356
02:16:13,248 --> 02:16:15,416
Shut up, you twit.

1357
02:16:15,750 --> 02:16:18,169
- Come with me.
- Robin!

1358
02:16:20,505 --> 02:16:21,088
Marian.

1359
02:16:22,591 --> 02:16:24,341
Marian!

1360
02:16:24,968 --> 02:16:26,844
English!

1361
02:16:27,012 --> 02:16:28,596
English!

1362
02:16:28,930 --> 02:16:32,933
Behold Azeem Edin Bashir Al Bakir!

1363
02:16:33,101 --> 02:16:35,269
I am not one of you ...

1364
02:16:35,437 --> 02:16:37,271
 ... but I fight!

1365
02:16:37,439 --> 02:16:40,232
I fight with Robin Hood!

1366
02:16:40,400 --> 02:16:43,944
I fight against a tyrant
who holds you under his boot!

1367
02:16:44,279 --> 02:16:46,655
If you would be free men ...

1368
02:16:46,823 --> 02:16:51,285
 ... then you must fight!
Join us now!

1369
02:16:52,120 --> 02:16:54,622
- Join Robin Hood!
- Freedom!

1370
02:16:59,836 --> 02:17:01,045
Come on!

1371
02:17:19,481 --> 02:17:23,192
- Marian!
- Oh! Robin!

1372
02:17:29,157 --> 02:17:30,824
John!

1373
02:17:32,661 --> 02:17:35,162
- Close the gate!
- No!

1374
02:17:35,330 --> 02:17:37,498
Guard it with your life!

1375
02:17:37,666 --> 02:17:40,417
Bring the bishop to my chapel!

1376
02:17:42,254 --> 02:17:43,712
right there.

1377
02:17:44,965 --> 02:17:47,174
That's good, John. That's good.

1378
02:17:51,221 --> 02:17:53,055
Is she worth it?

1379
02:17:53,223 --> 02:17:55,307
Worth dying for?

1380
02:18:00,605 --> 02:18:02,147
Will!

1381
02:18:10,949 --> 02:18:13,117
Fuck me, he cleared it!

1382
02:18:17,914 --> 02:18:19,707
Marian!

1383
02:18:46,401 --> 02:18:48,736
We're doomed.

1384
02:18:53,283 --> 02:18:57,369
- 'Tis rebellion, my lord. We must escape.
- Marry us!

1385
02:18:57,996 --> 02:19:00,414
I will never marry you!

1386
02:19:02,625 --> 02:19:05,753
That's my wife, crone!

1387
02:19:06,671 --> 02:19:08,255
Get away!

1388
02:19:08,423 --> 02:19:11,383
She's ripe. She will give us a son.

1389
02:19:11,551 --> 02:19:13,218
You must take her now.

1390
02:19:13,386 --> 02:19:18,265
I will not take her
until we are properly wed!

1391
02:19:18,641 --> 02:19:23,937
For once in my life, I will have
something pure! Will you stop interfering?

1392
02:19:24,105 --> 02:19:26,607
'Tis madness to delay.

1393
02:19:28,443 --> 02:19:31,403
Marry them or face me!

1394
02:19:41,623 --> 02:19:50,130
Marian!

1395
02:19:52,759 --> 02:19:54,676
Where is she?

1396
02:19:58,807 --> 02:20:02,559
- The Lady Marian?
- Up the stairs, that way!

1397
02:20:05,647 --> 02:20:07,481
Marian?

1398
02:20:08,775 --> 02:20:10,484
Marian!

1399
02:20:10,819 --> 02:20:12,111
Robin!

1400
02:20:12,278 --> 02:20:15,322
- Get on with it!
- Robin!

1401
02:20:18,910 --> 02:20:20,452
Statue.

1402
02:20:22,330 --> 02:20:25,833
Do you, George,
Sheriff of Nottingham ...

1403
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:27,960
 ... take this woman to be your wife?

1404
02:20:36,678 --> 02:20:37,678
To have and to hold ...

1405
02:20:39,264 --> 02:20:42,516
 ... in sickness and in health,
for better or worse, richer --

1406
02:20:42,684 --> 02:20:45,686
- Yes, yes! Come on!
- Make haste!

1407
02:20:45,854 --> 02:20:51,316
And do you, Marian of the house of Dubois,
take this man to be your husband?

1408
02:20:51,484 --> 02:20:53,694
Yes, of course she does.

1409
02:20:59,159 --> 02:21:00,534
Marian!

1410
02:21:00,702 --> 02:21:02,286
Damned English oak!

1411
02:21:02,454 --> 02:21:04,538
- Robin! Robin!
- Marian!

1412
02:21:04,706 --> 02:21:06,540
I'll try another way.

1413
02:21:18,511 --> 02:21:20,137
What do you want?

1414
02:21:24,559 --> 02:21:28,312
I can't do this with all that racket!

1415
02:21:31,191 --> 02:21:34,485
How could you?
How could you?

1416
02:21:50,376 --> 02:21:53,212
- The painted man!
- The witch!

1417
02:21:53,379 --> 02:21:57,174
I didn't know. I didn't know it was you.
Please, sire, have pity.

1418
02:21:57,342 --> 02:22:00,093
Don't harm an old woman.

1419
02:22:18,613 --> 02:22:23,450
You may take this body, but it will not
be me! It will not be me!

1420
02:22:24,285 --> 02:22:26,245
Not again!

1421
02:22:27,622 --> 02:22:31,124
I now pronounce you man and wife,
in the name of the Father ...

1422
02:22:31,292 --> 02:22:34,461
 ... the Son and the Holy Ghost.

1423
02:22:42,470 --> 02:22:44,263
Robin.

1424
02:22:48,059 --> 02:22:50,143
Do you mind, Locksley?

1425
02:22:51,145 --> 02:22:53,814
We've just been married.

1426
02:23:05,660 --> 02:23:07,703
Recognize this?

1427
02:23:09,497 --> 02:23:12,499
It belonged to your father.

1428
02:23:13,042 --> 02:23:17,296
Appropriate, don't you think,
that I now use it to send you to meet him?

1429
02:23:19,299 --> 02:23:22,217
I shall never fear my father's sword.

1430
02:23:23,219 --> 02:23:24,303
Really?

1431
02:23:27,682 --> 02:23:29,891
Now we're even.

1432
02:23:42,113 --> 02:23:43,363
Robin!

1433
02:23:59,464 --> 02:24:02,966
If I must, I will take you
a piece at a time.

1434
02:24:06,137 --> 02:24:08,138
I'll do the only taking today.

1435
02:24:20,151 --> 02:24:23,320
You sold your soul to Satan, your grace.

1436
02:24:24,781 --> 02:24:29,618
You accused innocent men of witchcraft
and let them die.

1437
02:24:29,786 --> 02:24:35,540
Brother friar, you would not strike
a fellow man of the cloth.

1438
02:24:35,708 --> 02:24:38,710
No. No, I wouldn't.

1439
02:24:38,878 --> 02:24:42,214
In fact, I'll help you pack
for your journey.

1440
02:24:42,382 --> 02:24:45,592
You're going to need lots of gold
to help you on your way.

1441
02:24:45,760 --> 02:24:49,429
You're a very rich man.
This too.

1442
02:24:49,597 --> 02:24:51,390
Enough!

1443
02:24:51,557 --> 02:24:54,101
Here's 30 pieces of silver ...

1444
02:24:54,268 --> 02:24:57,270
 ... to pay the devil on your way to hell!

1445
02:25:50,992 --> 02:25:52,659
Robin!

1446
02:26:05,631 --> 02:26:07,716
Get ready.

1447
02:26:08,092 --> 02:26:09,426
No!

1448
02:27:37,974 --> 02:27:40,392
I have fulfilled my vow, sadiq.

1449
02:27:58,327 --> 02:28:00,537
You came for me.

1450
02:28:01,455 --> 02:28:03,707
You're alive.

1451
02:28:03,875 --> 02:28:06,293
I would die for you.

1452
02:28:14,218 --> 02:28:18,013
By the power vested in me
by God's holy church ...

1453
02:28:18,180 --> 02:28:22,893
 ... I say any man who has reason
why these two should not be joined ...

1454
02:28:23,060 --> 02:28:25,270
 ... let him speak now ...

1455
02:28:25,438 --> 02:28:28,064
 ... or forever hold his peace.

1456
02:28:31,569 --> 02:28:34,154
- Then I now pronounce you --
- Hold!

1457
02:28:34,322 --> 02:28:35,989
I speak.

1458
02:28:45,625 --> 02:28:48,793
- Richard!
- It's the king.

1459
02:28:57,720 --> 02:29:00,472
- I will not allow this wedding to proceed.
- My lord --

1460
02:29:00,640 --> 02:29:02,349
Unless ...

1461
02:29:02,934 --> 02:29:05,185
 ... I'm allowed to give the bride away.

1462
02:29:05,353 --> 02:29:07,771
You look radiant, cousin.

1463
02:29:10,650 --> 02:29:12,984
We are deeply honored, Your Majesty.

1464
02:29:13,152 --> 02:29:16,488
It is I who am honored, Lord Locksley.

1465
02:29:16,656 --> 02:29:19,366
Thanks to you, I still have a throne.

1466
02:29:19,825 --> 02:29:21,660
Friar, proceed.

1467
02:29:29,168 --> 02:29:32,003
Husband and wife.

1468
02:29:33,172 --> 02:29:34,714
You may kiss the bride.

1469
02:29:34,882 --> 02:29:36,633
I know that.

1470
02:30:02,243 --> 02:30:03,994
Now, get out of it.

1471
02:30:04,161 --> 02:30:06,913
We waste good celebration time.

1472
02:30:13,000 --> 02:35:02,999
