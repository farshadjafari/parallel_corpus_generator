new diplomatic reclassification.

00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:47,039
Officer Torres.
Have you been ever in the love?

518
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:50,556
Enough, Viktor. Who is it?

519
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,870
Who's telling you
to ask me these things?

520
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,428
It's a man of misery.

521
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,877
Misery?

522
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:04,078
- Mystery?
- No, no. Misery. Man of misery.

523
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,831
He's so sick. He's so in love.

524
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,512
But what did she say?

525
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,672
She did say, "Next! Next!"

526
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,399
And now she say,
"Please. Please come."

527
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,392
<i>- [Pager beeps]
- That's... Wait.</i>

528

[Shrieks]

529
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,232
- I coming now.
- No, wait. Viktor.

530
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,039
Viktor, just tell me more.

531
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,031
I coming. I coming.

532
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,031
Please, please.

534
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:53,990
[Viktor] Beeper went off.
Started beeping. So, I grab. I come.

535
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,674
[Frank] We have an idea.

536
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,830
Would you like something to eat?

537
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,434
No. No food. I stuffed.

538
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,349
OK. All right.

539
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,668
Thank you.

540
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,355
So, Mr. Navorski,
I have some very good news for you.

541
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,158
What?

542
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:16,596
I've figured out a way
to get you out of this airport.

543
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,193
How?

544
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:22,319
Well, we have laws here
that protect aliens

545
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,870
who have a credible fear
of returning to their own country.

546
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,349
If we can establish this fear with you,

547
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:33,753
then the CBP will be forced
to begin Expedited Removal Procedures,

548
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:39,437
to bring you to an immigration judge
and let you plead your case for asylum.

549
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,556
- Asylum?
- Mm-hm, asylum.

550
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:46,509
Unfortunately, the courts
are so backed up with asylum cases

551
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:51,276
that the soonest you'd get before
a judge would be six months from now.

552
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:54,875
Yes, and we would have no choice

553
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,988
but to let you go for those six months.
It's the law. You'd be released.

554
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:03,072
You would be free to wait
in New York until your court date.

555
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:08,314
But, believe it or not, most people
never show up before the judge.

556
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,109
- So I go New York City?
- Uh-huh.

557
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,430
You can go to New York City tonight.

558
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:19,355
But, you only get to go
if we can establish a credible fear.

559
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,032
- Fear?
- Mm-hm, fear.

560
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,599
- Fear.
- Fear.

561
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,750
From what?

562
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,592
That's the best part.

563
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:30,992
It doesn't matter what you're afraid of.
It's all the same to Uncle Sam.

564
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,469
So I'm going to ask you one question,

565
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:37,678
if you give me the correct answer, I can
get you out of this airport tonight.

566
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,871
So, I answer one question.

567
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,555
Go to New York City. Tonight.

568
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,868
- Tonight.
- Tonight.

569
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,632
- Tonight.
- Tonight.

570
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,840
- [Laughs] OK.
- OK.

571
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,069
All right.

572
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:00,597
Do you, at this time, have any fear
of returning to your own country?

573
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,636
No.

574
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,509
OK. Let me try it again.

575
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,313
- Your country's at war.
- Yes. War.

576
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,756
There are men in the streets
with guns. Political persecution.

577
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:19,115
- Yes. It's terrible.
- Yeah, it's horrible.

578
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,270
And God only knows
what could happen.

579
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,874
Innocent people
are torn from their beds.

580
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:26,713
On Tuesdays. I hate Tuesdays.

581
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,791
So you're afraid.

582
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,917
- From what?
- Krakozhia.

583
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,719
You're afraid of Krakozhia.

584
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,711
Krakozhia?

585
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:43,069
No, I am not afraid from Krakozhia.
I'm a little afraid of this room.

586
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,191
I'm talking about bombs.
I'm talking about human dignity.

587
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,713
Human rights.

588
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:54,476
Viktor, please don't be afraid
to tell me you're afraid of Krakozhia.

589
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,757
Is home.
I am not afraid from my home.

590
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,468
So? I go to New York City now?

591
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,911
- No.
- No?

592
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,479
OK.

593
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:16,519
- I'm afraid from ghosts.
- Thanks very much.

594
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,558
- I'm afraid from Dracula.
- Thanks a lot.

595
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,951
I'm afraid from Wolfmens,
afraid from sharks.

596
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,320
Thanks a lot.

597
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,391
- Damn.
- [Gupta laughs]

598
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,916
- Why you do this?
- Nobody read the sign in America.

599
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,511
This is the only fun I have.

600
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:49,639

That's why I'm not going to see you?

601
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,996
Let me get this straight.
I change my schedule to meet you.

602
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:55,230
I take four back-to-back flights,

603
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:59,279
fly 27 hours straight
literally around the world,

604
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:02,989
and now you tell me you're going
to spend July 4th with your wife?

605
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:04,991
The woman hates fireworks.

606
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,319
Don't lie to me, OK?

607
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:12,756
I know for a fact
you took her to Rome last weekend.

608

No, I try to call home.

So then...

616

- You know why men are such assholes?
- No.

617
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,554

what happens next,

He's very depressed
and decides to take his own life.

807
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:30,599
But Napoleon believes himself
to be of such superhuman strength

808
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:34,434
that he takes six times the amount
of poison needed to do the job.

809
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:38,911
His stomach is so full up with poison
that his body rejects it,

810
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,831
and he doesn't die.

811
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:44,071
See? Ego. Saved his life.

812
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,310

- Yes. To read words on bottle.

going to leave this airport.

863

Jake, he has no nationality.
OK? No country.

864
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:36,990
He's a national security risk, according
to my interpretation of Section 2.12.

865
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:40,868
I want you to put him in a detention
centre and run a clearance on him.

That's all I want.

867

What about a federal prison?

868

there's no room anywhere.

- I tried everybody. Nobody'll take him.

872

You want me to bring him back
to the terminal?

873
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:10,270
No. From now on, Navorski lives here.

874
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:25,309
The people who are coming here today
will be observing me, inspecting me.

875
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:29,789
But most of all they will be looking
at the way that this airport is run.

876
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:34,829
So let's show them why this is the
number-one airport in the United States.

877
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:38,276
[Frank]
We process about 600 planes a day,

878
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:40,874
with a processing time
of 37 minutes per plane,

879
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,871

880

881
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:48,756
We keep it as clean as possible.

882

- What do you import?
- Computer software.

883
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:52,553
That's a lot of walnuts.

884
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:55,632
Yeah.
My mother-in-law loves these things.

885
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:58,280
Every time I go to Brazil,
I bring her back a bag.

886
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:00,999
- Your mother-in-law?
- Yeah.

How did you know
those weren't for his mother-in-law?

889
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:16,877
If he's married,
where's his ring?

890
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:20,157
And if he's divorced,
who still talks to their mother-in-law?

891
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:24,313
I'm sorry, but really.
No offence to mother-in-laws, but...

- Yeah.

- It'll have to wait.
- No. This won't wait.

895
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:36,757
When the 9.12 from Toronto landed, they
found four prescriptions without an MPL.

896
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:39,354
They tried to take the pills away
and he went nuts.

We think they're for his father.

Be careful. Those flight attendants
ain't like regular women.

- What did you say?
- You been ever married?

1072
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:49,952
I had a wife and two kids in India.
I left them there 23 years ago.

1073
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:52,349
Why?

1074
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:56,479
I had a small tobacco shop in Madras.

1075
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,710
Made just enough money to survive.

1076
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:03,715
One day this policeman comes in
and tells me I owe him some tax.

1077
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:08,112
I said OK.
This is common. So I pay him.

The next day, the same policeman
come and keep coming and keep coming.

And I am paying and I'm paying him
and I'm paying him and I'm paying him.

1080
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:22,119
And finally, on the fifth day, I take
a knife and I stab him in his chest.

1081
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:27,516
- You killed policeman?
- No. I just missed his heart.

1082

When they tried to arrest me,
I run away.

1083
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:32,917
So you never go home?

1084
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:37,516
If I go home,
I go in the jail for seven years.

1085
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:44,436
What if United States catch you?
They deport you.

1086

my floor clean, keep my head down,

1196
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:33,192
I'm sorry. Sorry.
You got to do this for me.

1197
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:36,556
You'll get really fat
with all the food I'm going to give you.

1198
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:41,031
But, please, do this for me. It will be
the last thing I ask you to do.

1199
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:02,748
He waits for you to answer at Sbarro.

1200
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:11,675
- I have to work.
- He will wait.

1201
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:52,871
[Cheering]

1202
01:29:01,160 --> 01:29:03,071
[Viktor chuckles]

1203
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:14,991
- How was your flight?
- Good.

1204
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:18,157
Thanks.

1205
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:25,509
- Is something wrong?
- You'll have to come with us.

1206
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:28,831
You're kidding.
I come through here twice a month.

1207
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:30,797
Please follow me.

1208
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:32,791
I'm supposed to be meeting somebody.

1209
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:58,271
<i>[Frank] In my line of work,
there are three things that matter.</i>

1210
01:29:58,360 --> 01:30:03,150
The person, the document and the story.

1211
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:08,913
Find the truth of one
and you find the truth of all three.

1212
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,275
I need your help finding the truth.

1213
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:16,077
Do you know a man
named Viktor Navorski?

1214
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:17,673
Yes.

1215
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:21,232
Do you know why he's here
and where he's from?

1216
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:23,993
No. We're just friends.

1217
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:29,950
Have you noticed that he hides a can
of Dry Roasted Peanuts in his bag?

1218
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:31,314
So?

1219
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:33,311
What do you make of that?

1220
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:34,913
[Amelia chuckles]

1221
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,150
I'd make peanut butter, I guess.

1222
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:42,994
We know that he's planning to go
to the Ramada Inn on Lexington.

1223
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:45,196
Has he told you why he's in New York?

1224
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:46,508
No.

1225
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:50,309
- Has he told you where he lives?
- No. We just met at the airport.

1226
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:54,109
All I know is that he's a building
contractor, living out of a suitcase.

1227
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:55,474
That's it.

1228
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:57,915
- He's a contractor?
- Yeah.

1229
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,911
That's what he said?

1230
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:06,594
Amelia. I'm just curious.

1231
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:10,639
You are the kind of woman
who can get any guy she wants.

1232
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:15,356
Why Viktor Navorski?

1233
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:21,592
That's something a guy like you
could never understand.

1234
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:48,436
I guess you missed your flight again.
Or maybe you have a bad travel agent.

1235
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:50,636
Please. Sit.

1236
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:53,598
It's OK, Viktor. All men lie.

1237
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:57,116
- At least you're not very good at it.
- I did not lie.

1238
01:31:57,200 --> 01:32:00,749
You told me you were delayed.
You never said it was for nine months.

1239
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:04,832
Maybe you see the man
the way you want see the man.

1240
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:08,993
So what am I seeing?
Who are you?

1241
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:11,829
- I...
- Unacceptable?

1242
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:14,070
Yes. Yes.

1243
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:16,071
You want to hear the funny part?

1244
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:18,472
I broke up with him.

1245
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:21,028
I was coming here to tell you
he's out of my life.

1246
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:24,908
I'm free. I got tired of waiting.

1247
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,911
At least we have that in common.

1248
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:37,117
Amelia, you know what Napoleon
give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?

1249
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:40,313
No.

1250
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:42,391
I show you.

1251
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:44,391
[Footsteps]

1252
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:48,631
Please. Please.

1253
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:54,311
Sit. Please.

1254
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:09,876
That was gift.
Napoleon to Josephine.

1255
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:12,428
One thousand fountains.

1256
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:15,633
You built this for me?

1257
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:20,396
Please. Sit. Don't get wet.

1258
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:23,391
[Viktor strains]

1259
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:31,671
[Viktor] Come on.

1260
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:35,035
Oh... [speaks Bulgarian]

It no work.

1262
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:41,035
It should shoot,
big water up to ceiling.

1263
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:47,235
Just tell me the truth.
Did you escape from an institution?

1264
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,911
[Amelia] Are you a criminal?

1265
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:57,552
You're living here, Viktor.

1266
01:33:57,640 --> 01:34:01,519
You're living at Gate 67.
I just want to know why.

1267
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:03,511
Here. I show you.

1268
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:16,193
My father.

1269
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:19,477
Viktor, please tell me
your father isn't in that peanut can.

1270
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:28,511
This is jazz.

1271
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:37,439
My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski,

1272
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:42,196
see this photograph
in Hungarian newspaper 1958.

1273
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:45,954
He say he look at photograph
for seven days.

1274
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:47,951
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday...

1275
01:34:48,440 --> 01:34:50,351
Who are they?

1276
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:53,956
Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie,
Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins,

1277
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:55,951
Art Blakey, Max Kaminsky.

1278
01:34:56,040 --> 01:34:58,395
57 of them all together.

1279
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:02,837
After looking at photograph
for seven days, my father has idea.

1280
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:07,755
He begin to write letters to club,
Lickety Split, Snookie's Sugar Bowl.

1281
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:12,914
He ask the nuns to write English.
Hundreds letters.

1282
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,911
And then he wait.

1283
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:19,475
He wait month, week, year.

1284
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:22,472
My father wait 40 year.

1285
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:29,030
And they all sign names.

1286
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,991
One by one.

1287
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:53,511
They all write their name
and send it to my father.

1288
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:01,631
All but not one.

1289
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:05,238
Benny Golson.

1290
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:10,591
Saxophone.

1291
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:15,754
My father die before Benny Golson
write his name and send to my father.

1292
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:19,549
So I make him promise.
I keep promise.

1293
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:28,559
I promise I will go New York,
find Benny Golson,

1294
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:31,438
have him write name to put in can.

1295
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:35,955
And you've been living here
so you could do this for your father?

1296
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:38,551
Maybe I think he do it for me.

1297
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:48,075
You say you are waiting for something.

1298
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:53,109
And I say to you,
"Yes, yes. We all wait".

1299
01:36:56,480 --> 01:36:58,391
What are you waiting for?

1300
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:04,439
You. I wait for you.

1301
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:00,434
What?

1302
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:06,870

All right, everybody.
Let's raise your glasses.

1308
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:46,950
May he never lose his country again.

1309

Krakozhia!

1310
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:52,914
Amelia! You here early!

1311
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,150
Hello. Amelia, look.

1312
01:38:55,240 --> 01:38:57,754
Peace, peace in the war.
The war, peace. Come.

1313
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:00,638
See, the war,
the war Krakozhia is over.

1314
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:03,314
Peace. The war is over.

1315

- You know my friend in Washington.
- Yes, yes.

1316
01:39:10,240 --> 01:39:12,913
He has a lot of connections. Here.

1317
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,638
It's a pass, Viktor.

1319

1321
01:39:21,480 --> 01:39:25,314
Just go to New York, find that last name

1322
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:27,149

Why he do this for me?

1327
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:51,311
He did it for me.

1328
01:39:53,240 --> 01:39:57,153
I told you to stay away from me, Viktor.
But you didn't understand.

1329
01:39:57,240 --> 01:40:00,915
- I think you were confused.
- No, I confused about everything.

1330
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,514
I not confused... Not this. Not this.

1331
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:09,269
I'm sorry. I'm running late.

1332
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:12,318
Amelia. Why you go? Why you go?

1333
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:17,070
You know what Napoleon
gave Josephine as a wedding present?

1334
01:40:17,160 --> 01:40:19,116
It was a gold locket.

1335
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:22,397
And on the inside,
he made an inscription.

1336
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:28,951
"Destiny".

1337
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:33,511
Destiny.

1338
01:40:35,680 --> 01:40:38,797
<i>... rejoice in the streets
as well as in their local taverns.</i>

from high atop the parliament buildings.</i>

- Hi.

1342
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:52,314
I missed you.

Come on.

01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:13,631
Viktor.

1346
01:41:15,480 --> 01:41:18,790
Hello, Delores.
How I am today?

1347
01:41:19,720 --> 01:41:21,676
What do you have here?

1348
01:41:25,640 --> 01:41:27,551
What do you have here?

1349
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:38,956
Oh, no. It's not signed.

1350
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:42,232
What?

1351
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:44,993
This is a one-day emergency travel visa.

1352
01:41:45,080 --> 01:41:49,437
To validate authenticity, it needs
to be signed by the supervising officer.

1353
01:41:50,040 --> 01:41:51,951
Dixon?

1354
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:53,229
Yes.

1355
01:41:53,320 --> 01:41:55,914
Dixon.

1356
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:03,034
The war in my country is over.

1357
01:42:04,120 --> 01:42:08,875
Yeah. I know. Congratulations.

1358
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:10,837
It's strange, isn't it, Viktor?

1359
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:14,195
When you wait so long for one thing?

1360
01:42:15,240 --> 01:42:17,470
One tiny moment.

1361
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:20,074
I had that moment today, too.

1362
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:22,310
You see this badge?

1363
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:26,075
This badge means that I was made
CBP Field Commissioner.

1364
01:42:26,160 --> 01:42:30,950
It means that my authority over the
security of this airport is absolute.

1365

I go New York City now.

1376
01:43:27,320 --> 01:43:32,553
Part of my job is to get rid of
undesirables, and there are quite a few.

1377
01:43:33,720 --> 01:43:36,188
Like this guy, Joe Mulroy.
I think you know him.

1378

He's been here for 20 years, but he's
been running an after-hour poker game.

And then there's this guy, Enrique Cruz.
I think you also know Enrique.

1383
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:57,030
Enrique has been letting people
into the food preparation area.

1384
01:43:57,120 --> 01:43:58,997
That's a major security breach.

1385

The poor guy, I think he's a newlywed.

1386

But I'm going to have to let him go.

1387
01:44:03,240 --> 01:44:07,756
And then there's Gupta Rajan.
He's a janitor.

1388
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:12,152
But he's wanted for assaulting
a police officer back in India in 1979.

1389
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:15,630
I'll have to deport him.

1390

I will go home.
