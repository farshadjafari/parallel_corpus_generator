1
00:02:16,862 --> 00:02:19,422
NAPOLEON EXILED
TO THE ISLAND OF ELBA

2
00:02:19,798 --> 00:02:22,892
Portoferraioo March 4o 1814.

3
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,029
Same dream again.

4
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,035
The foulo bloodthirsty beast
is reigning over the island...

5
00:02:32,211 --> 00:02:34,145
that's been reduced
to a heap of corpses...

6
00:02:35,714 --> 00:02:37,341
and I kill him!

7
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:41,442
Good morningo Master Martino.

8
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,612
Your sister ordered me
to bring you breakfast...

9
00:02:44,823 --> 00:02:48,418
Good morning, Master Martino.
Your sister ordered me...

10
00:02:51,196 --> 00:02:53,130
Good morning, Master Martino.

11
00:02:55,767 --> 00:02:59,931
I wonder about the recondite meaningo
perhaps a sign of fate...

12
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,932
- What is it?
- Your sister...

13
00:03:02,007 --> 00:03:03,269
I'm not hungry!

14
00:03:03,842 --> 00:03:06,367
- Ordered me...
- Take it away.

15
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,645
Which draws me to...

16
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:14,646
- To bring you breakfast. Good morning.
- Did you hear me?

17
00:03:15,621 --> 00:03:17,418
- Yes.
- Well?

18
00:03:17,756 --> 00:03:18,654
Yes.

19
00:03:19,925 --> 00:03:20,892
Close the door.

20
00:03:21,226 --> 00:03:25,458
Which draws me to the object
of my sacred hate.

21
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:29,360
Martino, you'll be late for class!

22
00:03:29,868 --> 00:03:31,893
Why are you standing around?
Bring him breakfast...

23
00:03:32,037 --> 00:03:34,597
- and help me with the mattresses.
- Yes.

24
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:44,805
Dunce, I'll come back
with the hatchet!

25
00:03:46,151 --> 00:03:47,516
Sir Ferrante,
he said he isn't hungry...

26
00:03:47,586 --> 00:03:51,420
I'm going to give
your sister a hand.

27
00:03:53,425 --> 00:03:55,620
- What did she say?
- I don't know.

28
00:03:56,461 --> 00:03:57,587
Mad.

29
00:03:58,997 --> 00:04:04,560
NAPOLEON AND ME

30
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:36,795
Good morning.

31
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:07,864
Hello.

32
00:05:23,882 --> 00:05:27,045
- Good morning, how are you
- Fine, thanks.

33
00:05:29,421 --> 00:05:32,515
- Good morning, buy something.
- I'll be right back.

34
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:57,145
- Good morning, Professor.
- Good morning.

35
00:06:12,764 --> 00:06:13,856
Come on, come on!

36
00:06:20,572 --> 00:06:24,702
So, the arrogant,
reactionary ogre...

37
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:29,911
asked Buchettino:
"How did you climb up there?"

38
00:06:30,582 --> 00:06:33,483
Buchettino,
who was a free spirit...

39
00:06:34,486 --> 00:06:37,421
responded... colon...

40
00:06:38,123 --> 00:06:39,351
open quotation marks.

41
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:42,490
"I'd be a dullard to tell you!

42
00:06:42,928 --> 00:06:46,591
You'd climb up here and eat me."

43
00:06:46,932 --> 00:06:48,456
Close quotation marks.

44
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:52,564
- Pietro, bring me that paper.
- Me?

45
00:06:52,804 --> 00:06:54,795
Yes, come here. Let me see.

46
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:00,538
- But I didn't do it.
- What is this?

47
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,406
The Army of Elba, he said so.

48
00:07:04,783 --> 00:07:07,809
Bruno, who might this be?

49
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,313
- Our new king, sir.
- Since when do we have a king?

50
00:07:12,491 --> 00:07:15,324
Napoleon will become king of Elba!

51
00:07:16,528 --> 00:07:19,759
Napoleon?
For your information...

52
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,033
Napoleon is coming here in exile!

53
00:07:22,434 --> 00:07:26,871
From the Latin word exilium...

54
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,037
which means, out of the city.

55
00:07:30,175 --> 00:07:33,542
He was thrown out
because he's a scoundrel...

56
00:07:33,712 --> 00:07:36,806
and thus, will be tried
and executed.

57
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,877
He deserves any death he gets.

58
00:07:40,118 --> 00:07:43,053
- Why, Ferruccio?
- He's an arrogant reactionary.

59
00:07:43,154 --> 00:07:46,055
Like the ogre of Buchettino, worse!
Marcellino!

60
00:07:46,224 --> 00:07:49,091
- Because he's a dunce!
- Yes! You.

61
00:07:49,361 --> 00:07:51,625
He's a lump of poo.

62
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,561
- Yes!
- He's a son of a gun!

63
00:07:53,632 --> 00:07:54,792
- You.
- Son of a pig!

64
00:07:54,866 --> 00:07:55,798
- You.
- Piece of poo!

65
00:07:55,967 --> 00:07:57,059
- You.
- He's a fart!

66
00:07:57,135 --> 00:07:58,466
- You.
- Piece of shit!

67
00:07:58,637 --> 00:08:02,334
Worse! He's a traitor, tyrant,
and assassin.

68
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:06,574
An assassin who killed
thousands of young people.

69
00:08:06,745 --> 00:08:09,009
In one single battle,
12,000 people died...

70
00:08:09,414 --> 00:08:12,144
12,000 is the population of Elba.

71
00:08:12,384 --> 00:08:15,410
Imagine our island deserted.
Everybody dead.

72
00:08:15,921 --> 00:08:20,119
King my foot,
he'll get the reception he deserves...

73
00:08:21,426 --> 00:08:22,984
he'll be booed!

74
00:08:24,396 --> 00:08:27,024
Rotten cauliflower in his face!

75
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,768
Dead cats and rotten onions!

76
00:08:32,571 --> 00:08:34,198
Good morning, sir.

77
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:36,739
I warned you, Master Papucci...

78
00:08:36,908 --> 00:08:40,639
leave your political ideas
outside the classroom.

79
00:08:41,046 --> 00:08:44,948
- Are you unable to do that?
- It's painfully difficult.

80
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:48,013
I don't intend to make you suffer,
Master Papucci...

81
00:08:48,253 --> 00:08:51,916
so go outside with your ideas
and say goodbye to your pupils...

82
00:08:52,123 --> 00:08:53,852
who are no longer.

83
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,892
- Pupils?
- Yours!

84
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,026
Leave. You can leave now.

85
00:08:58,196 --> 00:08:59,561
Forever?

86
00:08:59,631 --> 00:09:01,292
In aeternis.

87
00:09:02,233 --> 00:09:03,200
Okay.

88
00:09:06,071 --> 00:09:07,299
I thank you.

89
00:09:08,573 --> 00:09:09,665
Dear children...

90
00:09:11,309 --> 00:09:12,503
goodbye.

91
00:09:12,711 --> 00:09:15,680
Remember, rotten onions!

92
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:20,040
Now, children, hands folded.

93
00:09:20,485 --> 00:09:23,420
"Salve regina,
mater misericordiae..."

94
00:10:02,627 --> 00:10:05,528
Come, Uncle Egisto
will introduce you to His Majesty.

95
00:10:08,633 --> 00:10:13,366
May 18o 1814o
the scoundrel has arrived.

96
00:10:13,938 --> 00:10:16,463
At dawno
the English ship "Undaunted"...

97
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:18,441
anchored off the coast
of Bagnaia...

98
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:21,443
he set foot on the island
this morning.

99
00:10:27,819 --> 00:10:29,912
I tooo wanted to look at his face...

100
00:10:30,121 --> 00:10:35,058
so I joined the crowd of fools
who welcomed him...

101
00:10:35,727 --> 00:10:39,094
with the blessing
of Mayor Egisto Lonzi Tognarini...

102
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,323
Grand Knight of Peckers.

103
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:43,298
Welcomeo Your Majesty.

104
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:46,196
I barely caught sight
of his grimace...

105
00:10:47,072 --> 00:10:51,509
more foul than how it has been depicted
by ass-kissing painters.

106
00:10:53,745 --> 00:10:57,340
The crowd is enthusiastic
about something worse than them...

107
00:10:57,816 --> 00:11:01,684
this places more blame on he
who charms and captivates them.

108
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,317
The more they venerate
that bloodthirsty being...

109
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:09,186
the more I hate him.

110
00:11:11,863 --> 00:11:13,091
Good morning.

111
00:11:14,499 --> 00:11:17,593
- I said good morning.
- Good morning, Ferrante.

112
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,338
Most of the cargo has been loaded.

113
00:11:23,508 --> 00:11:26,909
- Did you see him?
- No, I was busy.

114
00:11:27,245 --> 00:11:28,712
Are you ready?

115
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,177
Brother, I'm confused.

116
00:11:32,383 --> 00:11:35,352
Are you setting sail or not?

117
00:11:36,387 --> 00:11:37,979
They should have cut off
his head...

118
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:41,559
but instead they make him
our sovereign.

119
00:11:41,793 --> 00:11:43,988
What does that have to do
with your departure?

120
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:47,791
You're mixing work and politics.

121
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:51,359
Tell me why! I'm an imbecile!

122
00:11:51,903 --> 00:11:55,896
I consider it philosophically
correct, ethical!

123
00:11:56,574 --> 00:11:59,372
Politics at the expense of others...

124
00:11:59,544 --> 00:12:03,071
removes you from duties
and real life, which is elsewhere.

125
00:12:03,281 --> 00:12:04,748
Elsewhere, in the shop?

126
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:07,510
You lost your job, you surround
yourself with faded books...

127
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,880
containing no trace of reality.

128
00:12:10,054 --> 00:12:12,818
- Let go of my arm!
- Answer me, are you setting sail?

129
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,388
Is that a question or an order?

130
00:12:15,627 --> 00:12:19,757
If it's an order, let it be clear
that I take orders from no one.

131
00:12:19,931 --> 00:12:21,091
Understand?

132
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:22,898
Holy Mary...

133
00:12:25,069 --> 00:12:26,127
Quietly!

134
00:12:30,508 --> 00:12:33,500
- Careful!
- It's your brother's lunch.

135
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,043
Room service! Absurd!

136
00:12:37,148 --> 00:12:38,342
Careful!

137
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,351
- Sorry.
- He's so lazy.

138
00:12:40,351 --> 00:12:44,082
400 bottles of Aleatico wine,
280 by 3 sqm of storage space...

139
00:12:44,289 --> 00:12:47,053
plus these bales of buckwheat.

140
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:51,188
When your brother's ready,
they'll set sail.

141
00:12:51,462 --> 00:12:52,724
Martino won't go.

142
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,525
You must go, Oreste.

143
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,430
I know your wife is ill...

144
00:12:59,604 --> 00:13:02,004
My daughter gives birth
at the end of the month.

145
00:13:02,173 --> 00:13:04,004
- May I speak to you?
- Quiet!

146
00:13:05,543 --> 00:13:06,840
So, it isn't possible?

147
00:13:08,213 --> 00:13:09,976
Master, if you command me...

148
00:13:10,381 --> 00:13:12,076
If you command him...

149
00:13:13,284 --> 00:13:14,615
You be quiet!

150
00:13:15,119 --> 00:13:17,280
Go on, I'll see you at the pier.

151
00:13:18,323 --> 00:13:21,724
So I'll have to set sail,
with all the things I have to do!

152
00:13:21,893 --> 00:13:26,660
Try to understand, I want to stay
and see what Napoleon does.

153
00:13:27,298 --> 00:13:28,629
Are you fighting?

154
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:33,765
Diamantina, your brother won't leave
because he hates Napoleon.

155
00:13:33,838 --> 00:13:35,406
- Yes.
- I hate him too...

156
00:13:35,406 --> 00:13:36,737
but what does that matter?

157
00:13:36,975 --> 00:13:40,001
I don't feel like leaving
for three months.

158
00:13:40,411 --> 00:13:44,404
I feel uneasy and wary,
I don't know why.

159
00:13:44,582 --> 00:13:48,450
Marseilles, Genoa, Barcelona,
Gibraltar, Lisbon!

160
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,180
- Some people would pay to do it.
- Exactly!

161
00:13:51,689 --> 00:13:53,520
Don't you want to be a writer?

162
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,221
New worlds, customs, traditions.

163
00:13:57,428 --> 00:14:00,261
A writer mustn't go
dawdling around...

164
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:04,424
he must be the eyes and voice
of his country.

165
00:14:04,702 --> 00:14:08,331
I must stay here
and see what that scoundrel does...

166
00:14:08,439 --> 00:14:09,906
and bear witness to it.

167
00:14:10,074 --> 00:14:13,305
Uneasy and wary my foot,
I know why you don't want to leave!

168
00:14:13,745 --> 00:14:14,769
What do you know?

169
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:18,315
That old, foul,
Miss Big Buns is back.

170
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:21,077
- Quiet, you idiot!
- I'll speak when I please.

171
00:14:21,252 --> 00:14:24,915
You're no Jacobin,
you're just the Countess's plaything...

172
00:14:25,089 --> 00:14:26,249
and she's a whore!

173
00:14:26,357 --> 00:14:29,121
What are you saying, you idiot!

174
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:32,156
- She's a Baroness, not a Countess.
- She's not a whore!

175
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,255
How dare you, you spinster!

176
00:14:34,465 --> 00:14:36,467
- How dare you?
- How you dare!

177
00:14:36,467 --> 00:14:39,061
Don't you dare touch your sister!

178
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:41,836
Dreadful rats!

179
00:14:44,042 --> 00:14:46,875
- You're nothing but beasts!
- What did I do?

180
00:14:48,246 --> 00:14:49,235
So?

181
00:14:50,148 --> 00:14:51,479
Truce! Truce!

182
00:14:52,216 --> 00:14:54,776
- Truce!
- Truce! Truce!

183
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:57,082
- Shame on us, we're siblings.
- We're shameful!

184
00:15:00,391 --> 00:15:02,416
What did dad say before he died?

185
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,925
- I know.
- Let's say it again.

186
00:15:04,128 --> 00:15:06,756
- "Be a mother to him".
- "Be a father to him".

187
00:15:06,831 --> 00:15:08,162
Both.

188
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,401
- We love you...
- Yes.

189
00:15:10,401 --> 00:15:14,064
That's why we tell you
to not lock yourself in your room...

190
00:15:14,238 --> 00:15:17,571
acting as if you were
Dante Alighieri and we were...

191
00:15:17,775 --> 00:15:19,766
- Two lumps of sod!
- Yes.

192
00:15:20,845 --> 00:15:25,873
Now be good, go pack,
and set sail.

193
00:15:31,923 --> 00:15:32,890
No.

194
00:15:37,695 --> 00:15:38,796
- Mirella?
- Yes.

195
00:15:38,796 --> 00:15:42,027
Put all his things in a sack...

196
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,928
and place it outside
because I am leaving...

197
00:15:45,103 --> 00:15:47,469
but you're not staying
in this house, get out!

198
00:15:47,705 --> 00:15:49,696
- Ferrante...
- Don't Ferrante me!

199
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:54,102
Do as he says, actually...

200
00:15:54,946 --> 00:15:56,174
I'll do it myself.

201
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,446
Farewell!

202
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,880
Ferrante...

203
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,916
Martino...

204
00:16:08,893 --> 00:16:10,622
What a mess!

205
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:23,331
Don't go.

206
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:24,703
- Stop crying.
- I'm not crying!

207
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,710
Don't make things worse.

208
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:28,643
- I'm not crying!
- That's the way.

209
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,472
Let's go!

210
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,625
Farewell, brother.

211
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:46,093
Goodbye! I'll miss you.

212
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,159
Forgive me.

213
00:17:10,555 --> 00:17:13,422
Hurry up!

214
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:45,948
Prepare yourselves!

215
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:52,156
Arms to the right.

216
00:17:53,397 --> 00:17:55,991
Arms to the left.

217
00:18:07,145 --> 00:18:10,774
- Good morning, master teacher.
- Alas, I'm no longer a teacher.

218
00:18:11,315 --> 00:18:12,646
Good morning anyway.

219
00:18:18,689 --> 00:18:19,747
Emilia?

220
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:21,390
Emilia?

221
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:24,020
- Mr. Martino.
- Is Madam in her room?

222
00:18:24,128 --> 00:18:25,459
In an impossible mood!

223
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:29,091
Notary Baccelli
and Councilor Mainardi are here.

224
00:18:29,167 --> 00:18:32,102
- She used unkind words with us.
- Bad words!

225
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:35,037
- You might want to return later.
- Excuse me.

226
00:18:35,873 --> 00:18:39,434
Not again? Please!

227
00:18:39,544 --> 00:18:44,538
That sea voyage was a nightmare,
I was sick to my stomach.

228
00:18:44,782 --> 00:18:46,249
My grandmother used to say...

229
00:18:46,317 --> 00:18:50,083
"For us residents of Citta di Castello,
the sea gives us rotgut."

230
00:18:50,688 --> 00:18:55,250
I don't want to see anyone,
you handle evetything.

231
00:18:56,694 --> 00:18:58,662
I'll leave the tray and be off.

232
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,024
Oh my!

233
00:19:01,899 --> 00:19:03,298
Oh my!

234
00:19:03,734 --> 00:19:05,964
I can't believe it's you!

235
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,331
Welcome back.

236
00:19:08,139 --> 00:19:10,164
- Are you angry with me?
- Why?

237
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,672
I didn't inform you I had arrived.

238
00:19:13,911 --> 00:19:18,143
But I'm glad you're here,
I have something to tell you.

239
00:19:18,482 --> 00:19:19,676
Me too.

240
00:19:20,585 --> 00:19:23,418
- I came to say I accept.
- What?

241
00:19:23,921 --> 00:19:28,092
Your proposal
that I move in with you.

242
00:19:28,092 --> 00:19:30,686
- What?
- Remember? Emilia?

243
00:19:31,028 --> 00:19:34,725
You said I could tend the garden
and library...

244
00:19:35,433 --> 00:19:37,128
even in your absence.

245
00:19:38,035 --> 00:19:38,967
Emilia?

246
00:19:40,004 --> 00:19:42,564
- I accept.
- Right, I did propose that.

247
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:45,867
- Will you help me?
- You don't seem happy.

248
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,475
The only thing I like
about this empire is the style...

249
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:51,409
Iofty petticoat
that hides the hips and rear...

250
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:54,883
while the cupolas are on display
for admirers.

251
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,116
What did you want to tell me?

252
00:19:57,655 --> 00:20:00,283
You're so precious
with that prickly beard.

253
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,456
What did you have to tell me?

254
00:20:03,294 --> 00:20:06,457
My dear Martino,
we can no longer see each other...

255
00:20:06,931 --> 00:20:08,364
we simply can't.

256
00:20:08,532 --> 00:20:10,022
Why?

257
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:13,534
When a relationship is over,
it's over.

258
00:20:14,272 --> 00:20:15,534
Over?

259
00:20:15,606 --> 00:20:18,905
I'm sorry for throwing cold water
on your flames.

260
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:24,379
She's arrived,
I'll go there and say I love her...

261
00:20:24,582 --> 00:20:29,884
we'll roll around on the bed
and meet again in 15 days.

262
00:20:30,588 --> 00:20:31,520
Emilia!

263
00:20:31,589 --> 00:20:33,750
I liked it as much as you did.

264
00:20:33,924 --> 00:20:37,121
"He arrives, reads me his poetry
of rhymed couplets...

265
00:20:37,228 --> 00:20:39,594
we'll kiss each other all over...

266
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:42,097
then I'll return
to my 80-year-old...

267
00:20:42,233 --> 00:20:44,895
asinine Bourbon husband in Naples".

268
00:20:47,805 --> 00:20:49,329
- Martino?
- Yes.

269
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,338
Come here.

270
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:52,607
Here I am.

271
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,975
We're selling it all:
Villa, farm, and mines.

272
00:20:56,247 --> 00:20:59,774
- Selling, when?
- Now, right now.

273
00:20:59,984 --> 00:21:03,112
The Mayor of Porto Longone,
who now goes by Maire...

274
00:21:03,254 --> 00:21:05,119
is buying on behalf of His Majesty.

275
00:21:05,356 --> 00:21:07,916
For him,
small Napoleon is a big deal.

276
00:21:08,092 --> 00:21:11,391
- Another sign?
- Sign of what?

277
00:21:11,996 --> 00:21:16,626
- Nothing.
- Come on, smile!

278
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:20,135
Don't make that gloomy face
or I'll become sad.

279
00:21:20,771 --> 00:21:23,467
- Shall we toast with champagne?
- At this hour?

280
00:21:24,141 --> 00:21:27,736
- I never expected this.
- I'm sorry.

281
00:21:27,945 --> 00:21:31,574
I'll call for some champagne.
Pascalina?

282
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,344
So for you, I'm just...

283
00:21:35,453 --> 00:21:37,353
A fortnightly whim?

284
00:21:38,055 --> 00:21:40,922
A fortnightly whim... that's right.

285
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:46,795
Since you're kind and good,
you'd suffer if I suffered?

286
00:21:47,331 --> 00:21:49,026
- Of course.
- Sure.

287
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:54,099
Don't bother suffering,
I think the same thing you do.

288
00:21:54,705 --> 00:21:56,195
Goodness, what do I think?

289
00:21:56,874 --> 00:22:01,243
For serious reasons,
I too must say farewell forever.

290
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:02,476
Goodbye!

291
00:22:02,546 --> 00:22:06,744
- You called?
- Get out! Now!

292
00:22:07,685 --> 00:22:09,585
- Sincerity is wonderfulo Martino!
- My goodness.

293
00:22:09,687 --> 00:22:10,654
I agree.?

294
00:22:10,855 --> 00:22:12,584
- Pig!
- Are you mad?

295
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,280
You sure seized the opportunity!

296
00:22:14,358 --> 00:22:18,419
Your false,
cowardly, petty sincerity!

297
00:22:18,696 --> 00:22:21,426
- And yours?
- A pitiful lie.

298
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:25,261
Actually, a pathetic lie, for me!

299
00:22:25,836 --> 00:22:27,497
How humiliating!

300
00:22:27,571 --> 00:22:28,439
Emilia?

301
00:22:28,439 --> 00:22:31,237
- Leave!
- Let's be clear.

302
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:33,138
What's there to clarify, Casinoski?

303
00:22:33,377 --> 00:22:37,473
I had a Russian servant whom I called
Cretinoski, he liked it.

304
00:22:37,615 --> 00:22:38,673
I know.

305
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:43,079
What's there to clarify,
you're 19 and I'm 40!

306
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,152
I'm 21!

307
00:22:44,221 --> 00:22:48,055
I thought: "Next year my breasts
will droop and he'll leave me...

308
00:22:48,192 --> 00:22:50,251
then what'll I do, kill myself?

309
00:22:51,429 --> 00:22:55,092
I'll leave him so I won't suffer."

310
00:22:55,366 --> 00:22:58,597
Next year my foot,
you were already planning it!

311
00:23:16,821 --> 00:23:18,755
There are people waiting for me.

312
00:23:36,273 --> 00:23:39,367
"O goddess,
with time thou hast fled away...

313
00:23:40,778 --> 00:23:43,941
to grievous memories
abandoning me...

314
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:47,240
and to a future
faced with blinding fear."

315
00:24:03,133 --> 00:24:04,430
I'll sleep here.

316
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,700
Does anyone mind if I sleep here?

317
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:13,937
I'll sleep here.

318
00:24:15,546 --> 00:24:16,672
It's nice.

319
00:24:20,017 --> 00:24:23,043
"Hear ye, hear ye, on this day...

320
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:27,987
the Great Knight
Maire Egisto Lonzi Tognarini...

321
00:24:28,225 --> 00:24:31,524
summons Master Martino Papucci...

322
00:24:31,795 --> 00:24:36,323
to present himself expeditiously
to confer with the aforementioned...

323
00:24:36,534 --> 00:24:40,095
at the Town Hall of Portoferraio."

324
00:24:40,304 --> 00:24:42,829
Are you Master Papucci?

325
00:24:45,142 --> 00:24:48,168
Cosimo Bartolini, are you deranged?
Who do you think I am?

326
00:24:48,379 --> 00:24:52,145
I was appointed herald,
I'm just following the rules.

327
00:24:52,416 --> 00:24:54,611
- The Mayor awaits you.
- The Mayor?

328
00:24:54,685 --> 00:24:58,143
Is it true your brother set sail
because you wouldn't go?

329
00:24:58,556 --> 00:25:02,754
- Mind your own business.
- I asked your sister.

330
00:25:02,826 --> 00:25:06,023
Now that Ferrante's at sea
and you've been kicked out...

331
00:25:06,096 --> 00:25:09,088
Diamantina is alone,
so can I court her?

332
00:25:09,233 --> 00:25:11,724
I've always been fond of her.

333
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:17,838
Be the personal librarian
and secretary of Napoleon?

334
00:25:18,108 --> 00:25:21,942
His Majesty seeks
a man of letters...

335
00:25:22,046 --> 00:25:24,537
he can dictate his reflections to.

336
00:25:24,682 --> 00:25:26,877
The Mayor suggested my brother?

337
00:25:27,051 --> 00:25:28,746
The pay is rather lavish...

338
00:25:29,053 --> 00:25:33,387
there's also the privilege of being
in His Majesty's presence daily.

339
00:25:34,091 --> 00:25:38,289
You don't know Martino,
he'd rather...

340
00:25:38,862 --> 00:25:41,194
- Found him, may we see the Mayor?
- Martino?

341
00:25:41,265 --> 00:25:43,028
- Here he is.
- Come along.

342
00:25:44,768 --> 00:25:47,396
- Please.
- Monsieur le Maire, Master Papucci.

343
00:25:47,738 --> 00:25:49,672
Come on in, please.

344
00:25:49,773 --> 00:25:52,401
Sir Mayor, I'll wait right here.

345
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:56,973
Dearest Diamantina, see?

346
00:25:57,381 --> 00:25:59,872
- My goodness.
- The Mayor and I are friends.

347
00:26:01,118 --> 00:26:02,551
Who would've guessed?

348
00:26:03,554 --> 00:26:05,044
It's the right moment...

349
00:26:05,356 --> 00:26:08,189
we're a state with an Emperor
as king, we're set.

350
00:26:08,592 --> 00:26:10,992
Hence, time to start a family...

351
00:26:11,829 --> 00:26:13,353
What are you saying?

352
00:26:13,831 --> 00:26:15,992
If I weren't me and they asked me...

353
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,068
"What do you think of Diamantina
and Cosimo together?"

354
00:26:18,168 --> 00:26:21,433
I'd say: "Great match!
Great match!"

355
00:26:21,739 --> 00:26:22,797
For what?

356
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,476
At the St. Anna feast, we danced...

357
00:26:26,744 --> 00:26:30,976
and I stepped on your gown,
you said, I remember it well...

358
00:26:31,248 --> 00:26:33,079
"Damn you, may you die!"

359
00:26:33,317 --> 00:26:35,615
- So?
- You weren't indifferent toward me.

360
00:26:37,121 --> 00:26:39,351
Very, very...

361
00:26:39,456 --> 00:26:42,289
yes, very good.

362
00:26:42,526 --> 00:26:45,154
Let's go give the good news
to Monsieur Drouot.

363
00:26:47,865 --> 00:26:49,492
- General?
- Yes.

364
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:55,099
Master Papucci accepts
with great honor.

365
00:26:55,506 --> 00:26:58,942
Really? Well, welcome on board.

366
00:26:59,043 --> 00:27:01,739
I thank you,
for this fortuitous occasion.

367
00:27:01,979 --> 00:27:07,076
As you see,
Elba has more than miners...

368
00:27:07,184 --> 00:27:08,742
fishermen and farmers.

369
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:13,489
You'll begin tomorrow, you may go.

370
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,525
- General?
- Goodbye.

371
00:27:18,629 --> 00:27:20,324
- Martino, wait.
- Excuse me.

372
00:27:21,165 --> 00:27:24,225
Now, let's take care of...

373
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:26,126
Wait!

374
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,731
- You said yes?
- So what?

375
00:27:36,914 --> 00:27:40,213
- Aren't you coming home?
- I was thrown out.

376
00:27:41,085 --> 00:27:42,143
Martino...

377
00:27:45,556 --> 00:27:46,784
Woe is me...

378
00:27:48,092 --> 00:27:50,822
I remember when we were tots...

379
00:27:51,028 --> 00:27:54,156
you threw a rock at my nose,
I still have the bump.

380
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:57,995
It was then I realized
we were made for each other.

381
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,067
Good, don't respond hastily...

382
00:28:05,275 --> 00:28:08,142
important decisions
must be pondered long and hard.

383
00:28:09,513 --> 00:28:10,878
What a woman!

384
00:28:23,594 --> 00:28:24,720
Maestro Fontanelli?

385
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:28,928
Argus, where is your master?

386
00:28:32,903 --> 00:28:35,633
He translates Shakespeare!
Well...

387
00:28:38,442 --> 00:28:39,374
Maestro?

388
00:28:40,978 --> 00:28:43,742
- Maestro, how are you?
- It's been so long!

389
00:28:44,047 --> 00:28:46,675
- I must speak to you.
- We'll have crudites with oil.

390
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,747
Jacopo kills himself...

391
00:28:48,819 --> 00:28:51,652
for believing
Napoleon would free Italy.

392
00:28:52,055 --> 00:28:55,024
I think Jacopo
should've killed him...

393
00:28:55,726 --> 00:28:59,127
the paladin of liberty
turned despot and assassin.

394
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:03,066
Are we correcting books?
Changing endings?

395
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:06,666
Change the title too: "The Second
to Last Letters of Jacopo Ortis".

396
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:07,828
Martino!

397
00:29:09,173 --> 00:29:11,869
You seem troubled, what happened?

398
00:29:12,109 --> 00:29:15,135
You were thrown out of your home,
fired from work...

399
00:29:15,445 --> 00:29:17,936
you dream of killing Napoleon.

400
00:29:19,817 --> 00:29:21,682
What did you come to tell me?

401
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:24,146
Troubled?

402
00:29:25,189 --> 00:29:29,387
My recurring dream
he gets sent here of all places...

403
00:29:30,027 --> 00:29:32,222
- and finally...
- Finally what?

404
00:29:35,632 --> 00:29:38,863
My date of birth,
September 9th...

405
00:29:38,936 --> 00:29:41,427
is the same as Harmodius's,
the assassin of the tyrant Hipparchus...

406
00:29:41,505 --> 00:29:43,268
you pointed it out to me.

407
00:29:44,541 --> 00:29:47,840
Harmodius! Come now!

408
00:29:48,645 --> 00:29:52,342
Do not laugh, these are
unmistakable signs from destiny...

409
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:56,007
the gods are trying
to tell me something...

410
00:29:56,153 --> 00:29:58,986
If gods did exist,
do you think they'd waste time...

411
00:29:59,056 --> 00:30:01,923
sending signs to Martino Papucci
of Portoferraio?

412
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,288
Your head is full
of harebrained ideas.

413
00:30:07,297 --> 00:30:09,026
You're the one who put them there!

414
00:30:10,834 --> 00:30:13,860
You must not only love liberty,
but also your fellow man...

415
00:30:14,137 --> 00:30:17,197
whoever he may be,
or else anyone could say...

416
00:30:17,474 --> 00:30:20,443
"Since I love liberty,
I'll kill anybody I want to."

417
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:25,437
It sounds like
you've changed your ideas.

418
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:30,047
Explain this rubbish to me, reason.

419
00:30:31,722 --> 00:30:33,189
Death to the tyrant...

420
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:37,025
you once approved of this thought.

421
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:41,688
Thoughts are thought,
it's not obligatory to act on facts.

422
00:30:42,065 --> 00:30:43,293
Damn it!

423
00:30:44,001 --> 00:30:47,767
I'm amazed at you,
you were in Paris in '89...

424
00:30:48,171 --> 00:30:51,538
you lost a son,
a volunteer soldier, in Marengo...

425
00:30:51,842 --> 00:30:53,833
he has no tomb
for you to weep upon.

426
00:30:54,444 --> 00:30:58,437
How dare you say such things,
you beast!

427
00:30:59,082 --> 00:31:01,312
You think I'm bursting with pride...

428
00:31:01,385 --> 00:31:04,946
because the Emperor
is honoring us with his presence?

429
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:08,318
Think what you will,
you break my heart but I don't care.

430
00:31:08,392 --> 00:31:11,589
You've lived twenty years,
which isn't enough...

431
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:16,098
to toss them upon the heap
of other corpses who died in vain.

432
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,062
Go back to your family
and be at peace.

433
00:31:19,303 --> 00:31:22,067
- The door is there, leave!
- Alright.

434
00:31:23,573 --> 00:31:26,167
- You've truly disappointed me.
- Out! Out!

435
00:32:30,807 --> 00:32:33,674
Is that you? You startled me!

436
00:32:34,344 --> 00:32:37,108
I came to get some books.

437
00:32:37,481 --> 00:32:38,812
Wait!

438
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:41,949
Please, don't leave me alone!

439
00:32:42,219 --> 00:32:44,312
Don't leave me alone.

440
00:32:45,789 --> 00:32:49,953
- Why are you crying?
- You always leave me here alone.

441
00:32:53,797 --> 00:32:56,994
My dear sistero
my faraway brother...

442
00:32:57,534 --> 00:32:59,365
father was right.

443
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:03,269
You were more than a mother
and father for me.

444
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:08,711
But for youo I was never a son
or affectionate brother.

445
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:13,746
Destiny has handed me
a more burdensome task...

446
00:33:14,084 --> 00:33:16,450
which you'll learn of
upon reading these words.

447
00:33:18,255 --> 00:33:22,521
I don't expect your forgivenesso
but I beg you for mercy.

448
00:33:24,661 --> 00:33:27,858
You're here, good thing!

449
00:33:28,231 --> 00:33:29,493
I'm leaving.

450
00:33:34,838 --> 00:33:37,363
- Good day.
- Farewell.

451
00:33:50,053 --> 00:33:53,716
That which led to such a firm
decision for a nature like mine...

452
00:33:54,057 --> 00:33:55,957
which never shined
because of this...

453
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:59,056
was the disdain
for his ominous undertakings...

454
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:02,423
for the bloodbath
he dragged Europe through...

455
00:34:02,866 --> 00:34:05,391
for having imposed
his hideous persona...

456
00:34:05,702 --> 00:34:08,193
upon each of us
to venerate or hate.

457
00:34:08,538 --> 00:34:12,804
Furthermoreo for the Italian
patriots he betrayed.

458
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:17,209
Henceo for all of this...

459
00:34:17,481 --> 00:34:21,178
I raise a castigatory hand
to obliterate him.

460
00:34:21,818 --> 00:34:24,981
What pretty words,
I don't understand a thing!

461
00:34:27,424 --> 00:34:30,951
As for your childreno
which I hope you'll have someday...

462
00:34:31,261 --> 00:34:36,062
I beg you to tell them their uncle
immolated himself for their freedom.

463
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:40,962
With loveo your brother Martino.

464
00:34:41,404 --> 00:34:44,430
Yes, "immaculated",
like the Virgin Mary.

465
00:34:46,243 --> 00:34:50,873
Not immaculated, immolated.

466
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:57,084
Luigina, what does obliterate
and castigatory mean?

467
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:59,787
I have no time for such things.

468
00:35:16,873 --> 00:35:17,999
Good morning.

469
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:22,101
I am Martino Papucci.

470
00:35:25,348 --> 00:35:28,051
- Sir, follow me, please.
- Excuse me, sir.

471
00:35:28,051 --> 00:35:29,018
This way.

472
00:35:32,455 --> 00:35:36,289
His Majesty
is very anxious to meet you.

473
00:35:39,863 --> 00:35:40,795
Come on.

474
00:35:43,466 --> 00:35:46,902
Please, this is the new librarian,
Martino Papucci.

475
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:47,902
Search him.

476
00:35:54,411 --> 00:35:57,347
That's not necessary.
He's only the librarian.

477
00:35:57,347 --> 00:35:58,314
Go in.

478
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:00,416
Please.

479
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:04,113
- I'm only the librarian.
- True.

480
00:36:13,396 --> 00:36:16,729
I am Martino Papucci,
kindly announce my presence.

481
00:36:18,501 --> 00:36:19,991
Please, announce my presence.

482
00:36:22,872 --> 00:36:24,840
You've been announced, lad.

483
00:36:28,078 --> 00:36:32,640
You are requested to reorganize
documents and memos...

484
00:36:32,749 --> 00:36:34,216
by era and topic...

485
00:36:35,051 --> 00:36:37,076
and to transcribe reflections.

486
00:36:37,754 --> 00:36:41,349
It's a tranquil task
I will carry out with pleasure...

487
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:44,525
with your help, Marchino.

488
00:36:44,961 --> 00:36:45,893
Martino.

489
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,796
- Nice name.
- Thank you.

490
00:36:48,298 --> 00:36:51,290
Always have pen and paper in hand.

491
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,570
You look at me?

492
00:36:57,707 --> 00:37:00,699
Is there something excessive?

493
00:37:02,979 --> 00:37:04,640
Is there something missing?

494
00:37:05,615 --> 00:37:06,809
Speak.

495
00:37:11,955 --> 00:37:14,116
More paunch, less hair?

496
00:37:14,924 --> 00:37:18,883
Eyes... do I still have eagle eyes?

497
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,661
Between you and me...

498
00:37:25,735 --> 00:37:29,227
I don't believe
I ever had eagle eyes.

499
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:33,509
Enough!

500
00:37:33,576 --> 00:37:39,310
In the morning, I will tend
to useless and important issues.

501
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:45,184
In the afternoon,
we will work here each day.

502
00:37:45,488 --> 00:37:48,048
It's past noon and I am hungry.
Are you?

503
00:37:48,792 --> 00:37:50,953
Please, lemonade!

504
00:37:52,362 --> 00:37:57,061
Lemon stimulates the appetite
and stops water from fermenting.

505
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,432
Hence, the abdomen doesn't swell.

506
00:38:12,382 --> 00:38:15,112
- Leave now.
- Yes.

507
00:38:20,156 --> 00:38:22,716
Martino is my name!

508
00:38:23,059 --> 00:38:24,890
I even took off my hat!

509
00:38:26,029 --> 00:38:27,519
Would you announce me?

510
00:38:29,566 --> 00:38:31,500
Idiot!

511
00:38:32,102 --> 00:38:33,831
Moron!

512
00:38:34,738 --> 00:38:35,932
Imbecile!

513
00:38:47,584 --> 00:38:52,214
He didn't "oblisterate"
or immolate himself, thank you!

514
00:39:11,007 --> 00:39:12,975
Dish of the day, please.

515
00:39:15,612 --> 00:39:19,139
Today we have macaroni
with sausage and broccoli...

516
00:39:19,449 --> 00:39:20,677
a delicious dish!

517
00:39:21,851 --> 00:39:23,944
- Well?
- What?

518
00:39:24,354 --> 00:39:26,254
- Did you see him?
- Who?

519
00:39:26,523 --> 00:39:28,047
Him! What's he like?

520
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:31,491
- What do you think he's like?
- Did you speak to him?

521
00:39:32,095 --> 00:39:35,326
Seems he wants
a troop of guards from Elba.

522
00:39:35,598 --> 00:39:37,190
Put in a good word for me...

523
00:39:38,101 --> 00:39:41,229
No need to, he'll enlist anyone,
elderly and children.

524
00:39:41,571 --> 00:39:43,061
There'll be lots of work...

525
00:39:43,373 --> 00:39:46,774
he wants to build
a breakwater barrier.

526
00:39:47,143 --> 00:39:50,977
He'll bring public lighting,
garbage collection.

527
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:55,541
Since we're becoming
an imperial power...

528
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:57,410
we'll have to put on airs.

529
00:39:57,487 --> 00:39:58,511
- Bravo.
- That's right.

530
00:39:58,588 --> 00:40:02,991
Imperial power?
What are we, England?

531
00:40:03,793 --> 00:40:05,556
That's an island too!

532
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:10,530
You'll see how much money...

533
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:14,036
traffic and commerce come our way.

534
00:40:14,404 --> 00:40:17,498
- It's a miracle!
- A miracle in Elba.

535
00:40:21,177 --> 00:40:23,372
- Not eating?
- I lost my appetite.

536
00:40:24,781 --> 00:40:26,043
It's so delicious.

537
00:40:27,116 --> 00:40:29,414
- What happened?
- He's getting too big for his boots!

538
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:31,547
That's right.

539
00:41:01,651 --> 00:41:02,845
Where is it?

540
00:41:04,988 --> 00:41:06,250
Diamantina?

541
00:41:10,727 --> 00:41:12,058
Diamantina?

542
00:41:12,562 --> 00:41:15,429
- Yes?
- Where's the key to my desk drawer?

543
00:41:15,498 --> 00:41:16,430
I don't know.

544
00:41:16,499 --> 00:41:19,525
You're obsessed
with being the key master!

545
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,467
I said I don't know.

546
00:41:22,405 --> 00:41:25,238
Why don't you look for it?

547
00:41:25,308 --> 00:41:29,540
You're always trying to take care
of everything.

548
00:42:14,557 --> 00:42:17,390
- What did he say?
- I didn't fully understand...

549
00:42:18,127 --> 00:42:21,392
Why doesn't that path
follow the coastline?

550
00:42:22,432 --> 00:42:24,161
Well actually...

551
00:42:24,601 --> 00:42:26,762
it's always been that way.

552
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:29,971
Perhaps because
the terrain below is rocky...

553
00:42:30,273 --> 00:42:32,173
while up here it's smooth.

554
00:42:32,241 --> 00:42:36,302
We'll blast through the rock,
ever heard of black powder?

555
00:42:36,613 --> 00:42:38,945
We'll straighten out the path.

556
00:42:39,549 --> 00:42:40,743
Pure genius!

557
00:42:41,417 --> 00:42:43,442
Genial! Genial!

558
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:47,818
It'll take half a day less
to go from Portoferraio to Marciana.

559
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:49,619
- Extraordinary.
- Extraordinary.

560
00:42:49,726 --> 00:42:51,853
- How come you never thought of that?
- That's right.

561
00:42:51,928 --> 00:42:54,055
We never thought of that...

562
00:42:54,364 --> 00:42:58,266
Inspector, architect, surveyor...

563
00:42:58,368 --> 00:42:59,596
- descend...
- Yes, sir.

564
00:42:59,669 --> 00:43:01,227
- Observe...
- observe...

565
00:43:01,304 --> 00:43:02,601
- measure...
- measure...

566
00:43:02,672 --> 00:43:04,230
and straighten the path!

567
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,700
On the double!

568
00:43:07,276 --> 00:43:08,800
Aren't you going?

569
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,745
Your Majesty,
I'll dash right down there!

570
00:43:15,918 --> 00:43:18,386
Hey, wait for me.

571
00:44:11,074 --> 00:44:13,736
There, got it!

572
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:17,805
If it were clearer
I'd be able to see the coast.

573
00:44:19,716 --> 00:44:21,081
Corsica.

574
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:29,690
My brothers and I would hunt
for seashells...

575
00:44:29,759 --> 00:44:31,727
to give to mother.

576
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:51,336
Careful, step away from there...

577
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:53,638
this wind is dangerous.

578
00:44:55,384 --> 00:44:57,818
I was looking for a pencil.

579
00:45:03,392 --> 00:45:08,352
It's true, our only happy moments
are from childhood...

580
00:45:09,232 --> 00:45:13,168
but recalling them is sad.

581
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,308
The day we lose our passion
for seashells...

582
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:24,677
a passion for ourselves sets in...

583
00:45:25,982 --> 00:45:29,383
which leads us toward vanity...

584
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:31,643
until death.

585
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:47,029
Today's compendium?

586
00:45:47,737 --> 00:45:51,468
- Compendium?
- Read me what I said.

587
00:45:56,479 --> 00:46:00,745
- "Blast through the rock..."
- No, my thoughts!

588
00:46:01,784 --> 00:46:05,379
"A throne is nothing
but a velvet adorned platform."

589
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:06,847
Next one.

590
00:46:07,924 --> 00:46:10,893
"France will always be
a great nation.

591
00:46:12,662 --> 00:46:13,594
What else?

592
00:46:13,663 --> 00:46:16,860
Those who have intense
and constant will, always succeed."

593
00:46:17,233 --> 00:46:18,894
Enough. Thank you.

594
00:46:21,771 --> 00:46:23,033
What's going on?

595
00:46:24,106 --> 00:46:26,904
Majesty, there's a crowd.

596
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:30,371
The road is blocked...

597
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,614
- we'll clear the way.
- Alright.

598
00:46:33,449 --> 00:46:34,814
It's market day.

599
00:46:35,585 --> 00:46:37,052
The market!

600
00:46:37,887 --> 00:46:39,980
Let us go to the market too.

601
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:41,882
Come, Martino.

602
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:06,876
Long live Napoleon,
you're number one!

603
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:09,782
You blow them all away!

604
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:11,051
Thank you.

605
00:47:38,915 --> 00:47:41,440
- May I?
- Be my guest!

606
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:47,418
In France we call this "renette".
How much is it?

607
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:50,459
- Two silver coins for a case.
- So expensive.

608
00:47:53,729 --> 00:47:56,721
For you, they're free.

609
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,690
For him, they're free.

610
00:48:00,102 --> 00:48:01,865
He's Napoleon!

611
00:48:03,372 --> 00:48:05,806
Down with the English,
long live Napoleon!

612
00:48:06,142 --> 00:48:08,474
Look at the eyes of these people.

613
00:48:10,212 --> 00:48:13,375
They see the reflection
of themselves...

614
00:48:13,449 --> 00:48:15,747
and their desire to be uplifted.

615
00:48:35,404 --> 00:48:39,135
To sum up,
has Napoleon chosen the multitudes...

616
00:48:39,475 --> 00:48:42,308
or have the multitudes
chosen Napoleon?

617
00:49:11,841 --> 00:49:14,071
- Well?
- He doesn't want to eat.

618
00:49:14,377 --> 00:49:17,676
- Open up.
- Leave me alone.

619
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:22,417
You used to despise him,
now you spend all day with him...

620
00:49:22,718 --> 00:49:25,516
and you treat your family
like strangers.

621
00:49:26,155 --> 00:49:27,952
Fine, starve yourself!

622
00:49:31,427 --> 00:49:33,327
What is happening to me?

623
00:49:33,662 --> 00:49:36,460
I hesitate and waste opportunities...

624
00:49:36,732 --> 00:49:38,529
now even my objects are missing.

625
00:49:38,634 --> 00:49:41,637
It's as if the godso
after having incited me...

626
00:49:41,637 --> 00:49:44,606
now enjoy cluttering my course
with obstacles.

627
00:49:44,907 --> 00:49:47,205
Or perhaps
they are testing my will.

628
00:49:47,276 --> 00:49:49,972
I can do it...

629
00:49:51,647 --> 00:49:53,342
Dear Mary! Martino!

630
00:49:53,516 --> 00:49:55,609
Or perhaps they
want to choose the moment...

631
00:49:55,918 --> 00:49:59,752
I must merely be prepared
to receive another sign...

632
00:49:59,922 --> 00:50:02,288
this time it'll be unequivocal
and definitive.

633
00:50:16,305 --> 00:50:19,001
You come along too, lad.

634
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:23,634
- Where are we going?
- To Pianosa...

635
00:50:23,712 --> 00:50:25,942
reconnaissance and boar hunting.

636
00:50:48,137 --> 00:50:51,573
I think the wind will help us.

637
00:51:07,456 --> 00:51:11,153
Grab the pans, dried codfish,
and onion stew.

638
00:51:11,494 --> 00:51:14,122
Trackers and hunters this way!

639
00:51:22,738 --> 00:51:25,400
Beloved Majesty, notre soleil!

640
00:51:25,741 --> 00:51:28,835
Notary Bonci Baccelli,
historic leader of Elba's hunters.

641
00:51:29,178 --> 00:51:32,011
I yearn for your command!

642
00:51:32,081 --> 00:51:33,708
Let us go.

643
00:51:35,651 --> 00:51:36,913
Let us go.

644
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:42,051
Your Majesty used to come here
with your esteemed father.

645
00:51:43,025 --> 00:51:45,425
Sadly, it's true.

646
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:49,561
Our only happy moments
are from childhood...

647
00:51:49,932 --> 00:51:53,561
but recalling them is sad...

648
00:51:53,669 --> 00:51:57,662
because a passion for ourselves
has set in...

649
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:01,039
which leads us toward vanity...

650
00:52:01,744 --> 00:52:04,508
until death.

651
00:52:06,549 --> 00:52:10,417
That's the meaning of life
in a nutshell.

652
00:52:10,819 --> 00:52:12,514
I'm speechless!

653
00:52:15,224 --> 00:52:17,158
In position for hunting.

654
00:52:17,493 --> 00:52:21,088
On our way, mouths sealed
because boars have keen ears.

655
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:23,664
As if the boars
are waiting for him!

656
00:52:25,434 --> 00:52:28,070
Two rifles are weighing you down,
give me one.

657
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:29,037
Thank you.

658
00:52:29,905 --> 00:52:31,202
Isn't that better?

659
00:52:35,544 --> 00:52:37,034
In position.

660
00:52:37,379 --> 00:52:40,075
Let the hunting begin,
unleash the hounds.

661
00:52:44,787 --> 00:52:47,415
If you ask me,
there's something brewing.

662
00:52:48,357 --> 00:52:50,689
- The boars are approaching?
- No way!

663
00:52:51,393 --> 00:52:55,830
The other night
they had us unload a sailboat...

664
00:52:56,165 --> 00:53:00,124
five heavy coffers,
I think they were full of money.

665
00:53:00,469 --> 00:53:01,436
Yes.

666
00:53:01,503 --> 00:53:03,630
They were taken away on wagon
in the night.

667
00:53:04,039 --> 00:53:07,372
I bet they're part of a secret plan
against the English.

668
00:53:09,078 --> 00:53:10,272
Weapons?

669
00:53:11,013 --> 00:53:13,914
There's never been
so much boat traffic...

670
00:53:14,016 --> 00:53:15,916
day and night, as you've noticed.

671
00:53:16,018 --> 00:53:16,985
I have.

672
00:53:18,387 --> 00:53:21,083
I'll go take a look.

673
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:22,923
Beware of vipers.

674
00:53:58,327 --> 00:54:00,022
Why are you here?

675
00:54:00,729 --> 00:54:02,060
Boars...

676
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:04,495
There are no boars.

677
00:54:07,803 --> 00:54:08,735
There are no boars.

678
00:54:09,872 --> 00:54:12,932
Positions are there.

679
00:54:13,976 --> 00:54:15,443
- The boars are down there.
- Down there.

680
00:54:15,611 --> 00:54:17,078
If there are any.

681
00:54:17,646 --> 00:54:19,511
The hunt is over.

682
00:54:19,982 --> 00:54:20,949
It's over.

683
00:54:21,016 --> 00:54:22,950
- I'd better take the rifle.
Yes.

684
00:54:25,521 --> 00:54:26,681
Because...

685
00:54:28,757 --> 00:54:31,351
It's beyond meo Your Majesty...

686
00:54:31,727 --> 00:54:33,217
there's usually
an abundance of game here.

687
00:54:35,297 --> 00:54:38,266
At least we got some fresh air,
worked up an appetite.

688
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:42,197
Aren't you hungry?

689
00:54:43,005 --> 00:54:46,532
I command the troops
to attack the dried codfish.

690
00:54:48,744 --> 00:54:50,109
How funny!

691
00:54:55,884 --> 00:54:59,820
Your Supremacy,
we nominate you honoris causa...

692
00:55:00,222 --> 00:55:03,885
one of us, a rough and tough Tuscan
of the woods and coast.

693
00:55:03,959 --> 00:55:04,891
Hurray!

694
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:09,756
If Your Supremacy consents,
I'll recite my lyrical poem

695
00:55:09,832 --> 00:55:14,667
about our passion for stomping turf
and hunting game.

696
00:55:14,903 --> 00:55:16,530
- It's lovely.
- Let's start.

697
00:55:16,705 --> 00:55:20,072
"At every minute of the day,
with fervent hearts we make our way...

698
00:55:20,142 --> 00:55:24,078
one eye open, the other closed,
finger on the trigger we are posed...

699
00:55:24,313 --> 00:55:27,874
with attentive ears we prowl,
to hear the boar's growl.

700
00:55:29,885 --> 00:55:33,821
- When suddenly..."
- Short, but effective. Bravo.

701
00:55:33,889 --> 00:55:37,347
- You should write more, let's eat.
- Thank you.

702
00:55:39,328 --> 00:55:40,329
Let's eat.

703
00:55:40,329 --> 00:55:41,762
- He liked it!
- Very much!

704
00:55:45,834 --> 00:55:49,972
Majesty, it's unbelievable,
terrible...

705
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:51,963
the boars ate evetything.

706
00:55:52,074 --> 00:55:54,201
Nothing works on this damn island!

707
00:55:55,077 --> 00:55:57,875
The bread, salami,
cheese, galantine!

708
00:55:58,213 --> 00:56:02,946
While you were up there,
in one second they came...

709
00:56:07,356 --> 00:56:08,584
Shoot him!

710
00:56:12,528 --> 00:56:15,224
Then we'll roast and eat him.

711
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:26,698
He was kidding!

712
00:56:27,242 --> 00:56:30,006
He's so funny he slays me!

713
00:56:38,287 --> 00:56:39,481
Lovely...

714
00:56:40,489 --> 00:56:42,081
we're snacking together.

715
00:56:43,392 --> 00:56:48,455
How odd, we attribute grace
to the sparrow...

716
00:56:49,398 --> 00:56:51,662
and fierceness to the lion...

717
00:56:52,768 --> 00:56:58,070
yet they both devour live beings,
insects or lambs.

718
00:56:58,440 --> 00:56:59,873
What's the difference?

719
00:57:03,879 --> 00:57:05,574
Are you not writing?

720
00:57:07,449 --> 00:57:11,749
Should I write that the sparrow
is as cruel as a lion?

721
00:57:12,454 --> 00:57:14,046
If you don't mind.

722
00:57:14,456 --> 00:57:16,924
You were speaking
of fallen soldiers.

723
00:57:18,694 --> 00:57:22,027
The two themes are connected.

724
00:57:22,598 --> 00:57:28,036
Nature says the strongest
overcome the weakest. So...

725
00:57:29,238 --> 00:57:30,398
Write...

726
00:57:30,739 --> 00:57:34,835
During the crucial point of a battle,
he who uses unexpected artillery...

727
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:36,605
is sure to win...

728
00:57:36,712 --> 00:57:40,671
with no worries of fallen soldiers.

729
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:43,310
What is it?

730
00:57:44,353 --> 00:57:45,684
How is that possible?

731
00:57:45,921 --> 00:57:47,252
I just told you.

732
00:57:47,356 --> 00:57:50,257
Position the troops
so they're easily gathered.

733
00:57:50,659 --> 00:57:52,995
How is it possible to not worry
about fallen soldiers?

734
00:57:52,995 --> 00:57:55,589
How is it possible to not worry
about fallen soldiers?

735
00:58:00,035 --> 00:58:04,335
War can be written about,
it can't be waged as it's written.

736
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:08,369
What impedes us from considering
war and death one in the same?

737
00:58:08,944 --> 00:58:13,677
Fear! It obliges us
to think about victory.

738
00:58:16,652 --> 00:58:18,620
Woe is you if you write that.

739
00:58:20,756 --> 00:58:24,920
You cannot imagine the pride...

740
00:58:25,327 --> 00:58:29,263
and desperate joy
of the many people I saw die.

741
00:58:29,731 --> 00:58:32,393
- Thousands of people!
- I know!

742
00:58:32,868 --> 00:58:34,563
Don't meddle in my anguish...

743
00:58:34,670 --> 00:58:36,763
stupid boy, how dare you!

744
00:58:47,449 --> 00:58:49,280
Evetything's fine, thank you Ali.

745
00:58:52,154 --> 00:58:54,850
I'm sorry...

746
00:58:56,358 --> 00:59:00,488
but I can't bear hearing you
apply arithmetic...

747
00:59:02,130 --> 00:59:03,757
to my pain.

748
00:59:06,101 --> 00:59:08,296
Tell Marchand to bring some cognac.

749
00:59:16,578 --> 00:59:19,138
Have you forgiven me?

750
00:59:19,481 --> 00:59:22,780
Of course! Yes, yes.

751
00:59:23,919 --> 00:59:26,854
I've heard some rumors about you...

752
00:59:27,422 --> 00:59:29,253
about our little teacher...

753
00:59:29,891 --> 00:59:34,055
- You rascal!
- The Baroness...

754
00:59:34,796 --> 00:59:36,263
- Can I serve you?
- Sure.

755
00:59:37,432 --> 00:59:39,900
I hear she's rather beautiful.

756
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:44,061
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

757
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:49,704
We're friends...
I have the honor of her friendship.

758
00:59:50,679 --> 00:59:53,443
You're quite the gentleman too.

759
00:59:53,782 --> 00:59:57,684
So you're a master in the classroom
and in the bed.

760
01:00:43,532 --> 01:00:46,365
His mother and sister Paolina
are here too.

761
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:49,071
- They're so stylish.
- It's true.

762
01:00:49,071 --> 01:00:50,299
Silence.

763
01:01:11,359 --> 01:01:12,348
Mr. Papucci?

764
01:01:12,761 --> 01:01:15,696
Mr. Papucci?
This is for you, it's urgent.

765
01:01:20,235 --> 01:01:23,329
We could go eat
some fritters with sugar.

766
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:26,273
Enough, don't overdo it.

767
01:01:26,374 --> 01:01:28,774
- Be happy that you took me to mass.
- Alright.

768
01:01:31,379 --> 01:01:32,971
Where's that madman going?

769
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:35,748
Martino?

770
01:01:35,884 --> 01:01:39,445
- Some biscuits and sweet wine, why not?
- Stop it.

771
01:01:48,196 --> 01:01:49,288
Where is she?

772
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:01,642
Hello.

773
01:02:02,110 --> 01:02:04,874
- What a surprise!
- I couldn't resist.

774
01:02:05,747 --> 01:02:08,443
I just disembarked,
I wanted to see your home.

775
01:02:08,550 --> 01:02:12,145
Since I can't see you anymore,
I can picture you in your settings...

776
01:02:12,754 --> 01:02:14,016
in your bed...

777
01:02:14,523 --> 01:02:17,924
with your books, toy soldiers...

778
01:02:18,527 --> 01:02:20,518
your wooden top!

779
01:02:22,564 --> 01:02:25,795
With your rag bear, how sweet!

780
01:02:26,501 --> 01:02:29,470
- What's its name?
- I didn't even know I had that.

781
01:02:30,172 --> 01:02:32,606
- May I keep it?
- Go ahead.

782
01:02:33,475 --> 01:02:35,943
Thank you.
I'll call it Martino.

783
01:02:37,646 --> 01:02:41,173
The cordial you requested.

784
01:02:41,383 --> 01:02:42,315
Thank you.

785
01:02:48,857 --> 01:02:50,256
You may leave, dear.

786
01:02:53,461 --> 01:02:55,326
- Close the door.
- Yes, sir.

787
01:02:57,132 --> 01:02:59,760
Sweet thing, she's in love with you.

788
01:03:00,535 --> 01:03:03,333
- Who?
- The servant, didn't you notice?

789
01:03:03,638 --> 01:03:05,071
Mirella? Oh, please!

790
01:03:06,641 --> 01:03:09,166
Listen to what
I'm forced to hear and write...

791
01:03:10,245 --> 01:03:13,442
"In war the best calculation
of genius is audacity.

792
01:03:14,816 --> 01:03:18,274
An army is a sword
with glory as its hilt."

793
01:03:19,654 --> 01:03:23,488
- Read, it's amusing.
- I hear he's fond of you.

794
01:03:23,859 --> 01:03:25,486
That's absurd, I hate him.

795
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:31,164
This is sweet: "Love is a folly
acted out by two people".

796
01:03:31,299 --> 01:03:36,259
He's a true expert
of the human psyche...

797
01:03:36,338 --> 01:03:38,169
not just a bloodthirsty strategist...

798
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:42,043
he's also an expert of medicine,
naval engineering...

799
01:03:42,043 --> 01:03:44,477
and noodle soup.

800
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:48,111
Let's act out this folly,
me and you.

801
01:03:48,717 --> 01:03:50,844
Make love?

802
01:03:51,219 --> 01:03:52,413
Yes.

803
01:03:58,526 --> 01:03:59,925
What's going on here?

804
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:04,463
- Madam surprised me.
- Good evening.

805
01:04:04,532 --> 01:04:05,726
Good evening.

806
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,667
A surprise? You surprised me!

807
01:04:08,737 --> 01:04:10,864
- What manners!
- I could say the same for you!

808
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:13,463
How dare you barge
into someone's room?

809
01:04:13,842 --> 01:04:15,036
Someone who?

810
01:04:15,110 --> 01:04:18,739
Dear Madam,
I'm the lady of the house.

811
01:04:19,147 --> 01:04:21,741
You're a rather boorish
lady of the house.

812
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:22,748
That's true.

813
01:04:23,118 --> 01:04:27,350
- You're a harlot!
- It's better than being a spinster!

814
01:04:27,622 --> 01:04:30,022
Who, me? I'm betrothed.

815
01:04:30,091 --> 01:04:32,525
- To whom?
- To whomever I want.

816
01:04:33,528 --> 01:04:34,995
To him!

817
01:04:35,230 --> 01:04:36,595
Cosimo Bartolini?

818
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:39,163
- But I thought that...
- I changed my mind.

819
01:04:39,367 --> 01:04:41,858
He's not a winner,
but most men aren't.

820
01:04:41,937 --> 01:04:44,462
Especially once
you've married them.

821
01:04:44,539 --> 01:04:46,666
- Thank you.
- You should see my husband...

822
01:04:46,741 --> 01:04:49,403
- Why?
- We even hit each other once.

823
01:04:49,811 --> 01:04:53,338
He wanted his mother's portrait
above the bed...

824
01:04:53,415 --> 01:04:55,076
she looks like a witch!

825
01:04:56,418 --> 01:04:58,249
Dearest Diamantina...

826
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:02,390
excuse me, I'm thrilled
about the news you just gave me.

827
01:05:02,390 --> 01:05:05,882
Simmer down,
the Baroness was talking...

828
01:05:05,961 --> 01:05:06,928
go wait downstairs.

829
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:10,987
Sure, we'll talk
about our matters after.

830
01:05:11,066 --> 01:05:14,502
Downstairs, you half-witted dope!

831
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:17,197
Take a seat.

832
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:22,498
- You were saying about your husband?
- He's never acted his age...

833
01:05:22,577 --> 01:05:25,205
he's 80, remove the zero
and he's 8.

834
01:05:25,313 --> 01:05:30,012
His mother still makes him soup
and feeds him.

835
01:05:30,085 --> 01:05:33,851
- Horrific! Why not leave him?
- And eat bread and flies?

836
01:05:33,955 --> 01:05:37,186
Better a poor husband,
you can leave him with no regrets.

837
01:05:37,258 --> 01:05:40,091
Or even a young handsome one
like Martino.

838
01:05:40,161 --> 01:05:41,093
It's true.

839
01:05:41,429 --> 01:05:44,921
But it's too late for me now,
I'm old.

840
01:05:45,166 --> 01:05:47,293
You're a rosebud!

841
01:05:47,769 --> 01:05:50,169
You've lost weight too.

842
01:05:50,238 --> 01:05:54,607
Out of sadness, seeing my home
half-empty like that...

843
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:57,203
They've removed
most of my furniture.

844
01:05:57,746 --> 01:06:01,011
Enough whining, I'll leave now.

845
01:06:01,116 --> 01:06:03,710
Why don't you stay the night?

846
01:06:03,818 --> 01:06:07,310
I was invited to stay
with Count Pallavicino.

847
01:06:07,489 --> 01:06:10,424
Head to Marciana at this hour,
no such thing!

848
01:06:10,625 --> 01:06:15,995
The sheets are fresh
and the bed is big enough.

849
01:06:16,364 --> 01:06:19,162
- Thank you.
- No, thank you!

850
01:06:19,367 --> 01:06:23,497
I'm honored to have made
your acquaintance.

851
01:06:23,872 --> 01:06:24,839
My respects.

852
01:06:24,906 --> 01:06:26,396
- Good night.
- Good night.

853
01:06:27,409 --> 01:06:29,741
- Martino, behave with the Baroness now.
- Go away.

854
01:06:31,212 --> 01:06:32,440
Why are you here?

855
01:06:33,281 --> 01:06:36,717
I was waiting for that chat
people have...

856
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:39,245
when they make important decisions.

857
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:42,255
Move it, you half-wit pinhead!

858
01:06:44,692 --> 01:06:45,818
Will you help me?

859
01:06:47,862 --> 01:06:49,989
Yes. Yes.

860
01:06:56,438 --> 01:07:00,101
Kiss me, this is our last time.

861
01:07:02,043 --> 01:07:03,010
Last time.

862
01:07:13,755 --> 01:07:16,952
This and this.

863
01:07:19,561 --> 01:07:21,392
Will the Baroness be needing this?

864
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:24,097
Take it just in case.

865
01:07:25,266 --> 01:07:27,234
- Want a hand?
- No, thank you.

866
01:07:51,059 --> 01:07:54,722
Why are you still here?

867
01:07:54,796 --> 01:07:58,789
Go away! Pleaseo go away.

868
01:08:20,688 --> 01:08:22,417
I'll take them inside.

869
01:08:29,330 --> 01:08:31,798
Don't worry, I won't tell anyone.

870
01:08:33,168 --> 01:08:34,328
Thank you.

871
01:08:36,371 --> 01:08:37,838
You have to hold tight.

872
01:08:59,227 --> 01:09:03,664
Careful with the painting of Baron
Mimi and his beloved mother.

873
01:09:03,731 --> 01:09:05,562
Okay, alright.

874
01:09:08,836 --> 01:09:12,135
Pascalina, hurry we're shivering!

875
01:09:14,976 --> 01:09:17,945
Do you know Martino and I
are no longer together?

876
01:09:18,046 --> 01:09:19,172
Stop it.

877
01:09:20,715 --> 01:09:25,243
When I go back to Naples,
we'll never see each other again.

878
01:09:25,353 --> 01:09:27,082
Stop it.

879
01:09:28,156 --> 01:09:31,387
Isn't he delightful?
Too bad he's always cross.

880
01:09:31,559 --> 01:09:33,618
- Do you know why?
- Enough!

881
01:09:33,761 --> 01:09:36,730
Because he despises Napoleon.

882
01:09:37,532 --> 01:09:42,401
- Enough, what does she care?
- She cares and how!

883
01:09:42,704 --> 01:09:46,970
Pascalina is Corsican,
she was the Bonaparte's servant.

884
01:09:48,876 --> 01:09:50,537
What can I say?

885
01:09:52,513 --> 01:09:57,507
I loved him like a son.

886
01:09:59,387 --> 01:10:04,620
Sit down,
tell us what he was like as a child.

887
01:10:05,693 --> 01:10:06,990
What was he like?

888
01:10:08,196 --> 01:10:12,633
A lad who was obedient, kind...

889
01:10:13,968 --> 01:10:16,766
and very sad.

890
01:10:18,806 --> 01:10:21,798
Many a night
I woke up to console him...

891
01:10:23,611 --> 01:10:25,670
because he cried in his sleep.

892
01:10:26,114 --> 01:10:30,642
- How old was he?
- Nine, ten.

893
01:10:31,719 --> 01:10:35,917
But through the years,
he didn't change.

894
01:10:36,824 --> 01:10:40,760
When his father, hoping
to be forgiven by the French...

895
01:10:40,962 --> 01:10:43,294
for having supported
independence...

896
01:10:43,798 --> 01:10:47,757
decided to send him
to military school in Paris...

897
01:10:49,103 --> 01:10:51,094
he was devastated.

898
01:10:53,274 --> 01:10:56,437
He was 16...

899
01:10:57,478 --> 01:10:59,742
he didn't want to go!

900
01:11:01,516 --> 01:11:04,144
He was afraid
of moving to another land.

901
01:11:06,054 --> 01:11:09,717
He was ashamed
he spoke French so poorly.

902
01:11:12,393 --> 01:11:13,860
Poor thing!

903
01:11:24,639 --> 01:11:26,163
I'll bring more water.

904
01:11:42,190 --> 01:11:43,885
Blockhead!

905
01:11:44,525 --> 01:11:46,049
Piece of shit!

906
01:11:46,761 --> 01:11:48,160
Martino!

907
01:11:48,229 --> 01:11:50,322
- What happened?
- A disaster.

908
01:11:50,732 --> 01:11:54,463
Bastard, how can you say such a thing
with that idiotic face!

909
01:11:54,936 --> 01:11:56,665
- Not the onions!
- With the onions.

910
01:11:58,339 --> 01:12:02,036
- Diamantina, what happened?
- Ferrante was shipwrecked.

911
01:12:02,110 --> 01:12:05,045
We don't know that,
I just relayed the news.

912
01:12:05,113 --> 01:12:09,641
With that moronic smile!
"There was a tragic, violent storm...

913
01:12:09,717 --> 01:12:12,083
hope Ferrante's all right."

914
01:12:12,220 --> 01:12:15,986
- He was laughing!
- I didn't want to alarm you.

915
01:12:16,324 --> 01:12:20,055
- I'm sure they're not all dead.
- Shut up, idiot!

916
01:12:20,161 --> 01:12:21,526
- Miserable!
- Not the codfish!

917
01:12:21,596 --> 01:12:25,293
- Miserable! Idiot!
- Easy with the dried codfish!

918
01:12:25,833 --> 01:12:27,095
- Relax.
- That man...

919
01:12:27,168 --> 01:12:28,100
Evetything is fine.

920
01:12:28,169 --> 01:12:30,933
That man brought a curse
upon this island.

921
01:12:31,005 --> 01:12:35,101
- Me?
- I'm talking about N.

922
01:12:35,610 --> 01:12:38,044
- N?
- I don't even want to say his name.

923
01:12:39,414 --> 01:12:40,745
Who gave you the news?

924
01:12:40,848 --> 01:12:43,043
Sailors from Livorno
who arrived this morning...

925
01:12:43,117 --> 01:12:47,019
they found the Santa Marina
dismasted near Majorca...

926
01:12:47,221 --> 01:12:51,157
the lifeboat was gone...
I just relayed the news.

927
01:12:51,225 --> 01:12:53,819
- Laughing!
- I wasn't laughing!

928
01:12:54,028 --> 01:12:57,896
One disgrace after another,
now Mirella too...

929
01:12:58,366 --> 01:12:59,663
Why? What does Mirella do?

930
01:12:59,801 --> 01:13:04,898
She doesn't want to stay here,
she left for her grandmother's...

931
01:13:05,006 --> 01:13:06,735
this morning at dawn.

932
01:13:07,275 --> 01:13:09,539
- Why?
- How should I know?

933
01:13:10,812 --> 01:13:11,904
Calm down.

934
01:13:13,014 --> 01:13:16,609
- Calm down.
- Poor Ferrante! I wonder what happened.

935
01:13:20,054 --> 01:13:20,986
What?

936
01:13:21,322 --> 01:13:24,120
It's my fault,
I should've left instead of him.

937
01:13:24,192 --> 01:13:26,524
- It would've been the same.
- Exactly...

938
01:13:26,828 --> 01:13:29,558
- See, he's laughing! He's laughing!
- No!

939
01:13:29,730 --> 01:13:33,029
I'm trying to lift your spirits,
turtledove.

940
01:13:33,167 --> 01:13:36,364
Now that we're engaged,
I feel responsible for you.

941
01:13:36,504 --> 01:13:39,405
Engaged my foot,
the turtledove is dead!

942
01:13:39,507 --> 01:13:41,839
I've changed my mind.

943
01:13:41,943 --> 01:13:44,070
Laugh now you moron!

944
01:13:46,781 --> 01:13:47,907
She dumped me?

945
01:13:50,952 --> 01:13:52,146
She dumped me!

946
01:13:52,954 --> 01:13:54,581
Goodness, my heart...

947
01:15:09,830 --> 01:15:11,422
- No, no, no.
- Sorry.

948
01:15:11,499 --> 01:15:12,431
Carry on.

949
01:15:13,601 --> 01:15:16,627
I'd better not, I'll ruin it.

950
01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:21,106
How proud I was
when they told me...

951
01:15:21,175 --> 01:15:24,269
Beethoven composed it for me.

952
01:15:24,679 --> 01:15:26,544
- Actually...
- I know!

953
01:15:29,951 --> 01:15:32,647
Then he changed his mind,
like many did.

954
01:15:35,189 --> 01:15:36,520
Many...

955
01:16:09,724 --> 01:16:10,884
Write it down.

956
01:16:13,294 --> 01:16:14,352
What?

957
01:16:15,696 --> 01:16:17,596
Napoleon cries.

958
01:16:19,367 --> 01:16:20,527
Write that?

959
01:16:22,103 --> 01:16:25,539
Yes, son, we'll let everybody know!

960
01:16:26,407 --> 01:16:27,704
Write...

961
01:16:29,010 --> 01:16:33,447
On January 23, 1815...

962
01:16:33,514 --> 01:16:35,379
Napoleon Bonaparte
declares himself...

963
01:16:36,317 --> 01:16:39,411
reformed, remorseful...

964
01:16:39,587 --> 01:16:42,647
no, repentant, write repentant
and that's that.

965
01:16:43,324 --> 01:16:45,758
Don't write that's that.

966
01:16:46,527 --> 01:16:47,459
Alright.

967
01:17:00,608 --> 01:17:02,906
You bring out the sincerity in me.

968
01:17:04,245 --> 01:17:08,011
- Ad posteritati notum 'facer'.
- Facere.

969
01:17:08,115 --> 01:17:10,515
Right! Facere.

970
01:17:11,318 --> 01:17:15,846
Latin rouses the anguish
of my days in military school.

971
01:17:17,091 --> 01:17:20,549
There's a notebook
in the secretaire.

972
01:17:21,862 --> 01:17:22,794
Thank you.

973
01:17:31,539 --> 01:17:33,837
"I'm always surrounded by men...

974
01:17:34,608 --> 01:17:36,041
I abandon myself...

975
01:17:36,510 --> 01:17:41,743
to the impetus of my dolefulness.

976
01:17:41,816 --> 01:17:44,046
Which way is it facing?

977
01:17:44,618 --> 01:17:46,347
Toward death."

978
01:17:48,089 --> 01:17:50,057
Toward death!

979
01:17:51,025 --> 01:17:54,586
I was 17 and I wanted to die.

980
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:58,325
I was hateful!

981
01:17:59,734 --> 01:18:04,433
I was ridiculous
with my Corsican accent.

982
01:18:06,474 --> 01:18:08,635
I hated them all.

983
01:18:10,077 --> 01:18:11,840
I hated France.

984
01:18:13,781 --> 01:18:16,773
- I should write this.
- Yes! No...

985
01:18:18,052 --> 01:18:22,853
No, write:
"I wasn't fond of France".

986
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:26,182
No, no, no.

987
01:18:29,029 --> 01:18:33,898
I'm hungry, let's have a snack.
Marchand? Snaks!

988
01:18:34,034 --> 01:18:35,160
Damn!

989
01:18:36,437 --> 01:18:40,464
Am I still the traitor
Beethoven repudiated his love for...

990
01:18:40,674 --> 01:18:44,576
even though I'm now convinced
he was right?

991
01:18:47,448 --> 01:18:48,346
Sit down.

992
01:18:50,384 --> 01:18:52,716
Doesn't repentance count?

993
01:18:54,622 --> 01:18:57,284
Should it be content with itself?

994
01:18:59,426 --> 01:19:02,554
I can tell you're thinking
something.

995
01:19:03,597 --> 01:19:04,757
Say it.

996
01:19:05,599 --> 01:19:10,161
You can't expect repentance
to be rewarded immediately.

997
01:19:11,338 --> 01:19:13,306
That is true...

998
01:19:14,809 --> 01:19:16,242
my friend.

999
01:19:17,812 --> 01:19:20,178
- Aren't you hungry?
- No.

1000
01:19:23,284 --> 01:19:24,376
Watch.

1001
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:34,318
Sorry.

1002
01:19:39,266 --> 01:19:41,166
Alright. Thank you.

1003
01:19:41,802 --> 01:19:46,637
I guess his Majesty would like to attend
another concert this evening.

1004
01:19:48,175 --> 01:19:49,335
Please, Campbell.

1005
01:19:51,078 --> 01:19:52,045
Please.

1006
01:19:59,153 --> 01:20:01,815
I adore my guardian!

1007
01:20:02,923 --> 01:20:06,415
Colonel Campbell, I adore him!

1008
01:20:08,929 --> 01:20:11,625
- Grab today's work.
- Yes, sir.

1009
01:20:24,979 --> 01:20:27,311
I heard about your brother...

1010
01:20:28,315 --> 01:20:31,682
I had a message sent
to all the harbor offices.

1011
01:20:32,353 --> 01:20:33,752
Thank you!

1012
01:20:34,255 --> 01:20:35,654
Evetything will be fine.

1013
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:37,950
I hope so.

1014
01:20:38,225 --> 01:20:41,661
- I'll write a few words to my wife.
- Yes.

1015
01:20:42,263 --> 01:20:46,324
I have a wife
and a three-year-old son.

1016
01:20:47,268 --> 01:20:51,500
I'd like my son here, not her.

1017
01:20:52,273 --> 01:20:54,207
He's beautiful and blond.

1018
01:20:55,342 --> 01:21:00,041
I wonder what language he speaks,
French or German?

1019
01:21:08,822 --> 01:21:10,119
See you tomorrow, Majesty.

1020
01:21:36,283 --> 01:21:37,341
What is it?

1021
01:21:37,718 --> 01:21:39,652
I thought I saw...

1022
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:43,048
What is it? Who's there?

1023
01:21:47,027 --> 01:21:48,551
- Come on!
- Alert!

1024
01:21:48,696 --> 01:21:50,755
- Alert!
- Alert!

1025
01:21:56,403 --> 01:21:57,631
What were you going to do?

1026
01:21:58,472 --> 01:22:00,406
Murder! Murder!?

1027
01:22:03,944 --> 01:22:05,969
Let's take him.?

1028
01:22:16,824 --> 01:22:19,691
Call all guards!?

1029
01:22:33,874 --> 01:22:36,468
Come on, don't do that.

1030
01:22:37,978 --> 01:22:39,605
Don't think about it.

1031
01:22:42,449 --> 01:22:43,643
I'm sorry, Emilia.

1032
01:22:44,351 --> 01:22:45,978
I got him arrested.

1033
01:22:47,654 --> 01:22:48,951
Martino.

1034
01:22:50,391 --> 01:22:51,858
My teacher!

1035
01:22:54,495 --> 01:22:55,962
Damn me!

1036
01:22:57,364 --> 01:23:01,596
Madame? We have a visitor...

1037
01:23:02,269 --> 01:23:03,327
My God.

1038
01:23:04,038 --> 01:23:05,505
My friend!

1039
01:23:07,007 --> 01:23:08,998
I was searching for you.

1040
01:23:11,011 --> 01:23:13,809
- Ali told me.
- A gift for you.

1041
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:18,041
It's only mother of pearl, but it's
worth more than what you saved...

1042
01:23:18,419 --> 01:23:20,979
this old shell of a king.

1043
01:23:23,590 --> 01:23:24,921
Heavens!

1044
01:23:25,526 --> 01:23:30,259
I come bearing trinkets
in a home which contains a treasure!

1045
01:23:32,766 --> 01:23:35,098
Please excuse the invasion...

1046
01:23:35,169 --> 01:23:39,629
it's an old habit of mine...

1047
01:23:44,178 --> 01:23:46,646
I'm honored by your presence.

1048
01:23:50,384 --> 01:23:51,442
- Majesty?
- Yes.

1049
01:23:54,388 --> 01:23:58,051
I know the person
you had arrested.

1050
01:23:58,325 --> 01:23:59,553
I know...

1051
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:02,354
and I know you care for him.

1052
01:24:03,697 --> 01:24:05,426
He's an exceptional person.

1053
01:24:05,899 --> 01:24:09,391
- He lost his son in...
- Marengo, I know.

1054
01:24:11,271 --> 01:24:12,568
What will you do to him?

1055
01:24:14,108 --> 01:24:16,235
Poor thing,
what will they do to him?

1056
01:24:17,177 --> 01:24:20,112
Nothing. The war is over.

1057
01:24:20,747 --> 01:24:23,079
No more death, no more blood.

1058
01:24:23,484 --> 01:24:25,952
- Am I right?
- Yes, Majesty.

1059
01:24:28,989 --> 01:24:30,786
Thank you.

1060
01:24:32,459 --> 01:24:33,687
My God.

1061
01:24:44,171 --> 01:24:45,365
How are you?

1062
01:24:45,739 --> 01:24:48,435
Fine, thank God!

1063
01:24:48,809 --> 01:24:52,301
I never stopped thinking about you.

1064
01:24:53,313 --> 01:24:54,678
Dearest Pascalina...

1065
01:24:56,016 --> 01:24:58,712
you've always been in my heart.

1066
01:25:01,755 --> 01:25:03,518
What honor.

1067
01:25:23,310 --> 01:25:24,800
Ferrante!

1068
01:25:24,978 --> 01:25:27,276
Ferrante!

1069
01:25:29,516 --> 01:25:30,813
Easy there!

1070
01:25:31,084 --> 01:25:33,644
We were so worried about you!

1071
01:25:34,054 --> 01:25:35,919
You crushed me!

1072
01:25:39,393 --> 01:25:40,553
Big brother!

1073
01:25:41,862 --> 01:25:44,660
- Little brother.
- You stink...

1074
01:25:45,098 --> 01:25:47,157
but you look nice with a beard.

1075
01:25:47,868 --> 01:25:49,335
Let's go home.

1076
01:25:49,970 --> 01:25:54,600
Dearest Ferrante,
we were all so concerned!

1077
01:25:55,075 --> 01:25:58,772
- Bartolini, why the kisses?
- We're family now, tell him.

1078
01:25:58,979 --> 01:26:00,640
Now's not the time!

1079
01:26:00,847 --> 01:26:02,405
- Alright.
- Let's go home.

1080
01:26:02,749 --> 01:26:06,207
- Can I carry your bag?
- You'll carry nothing.

1081
01:26:08,021 --> 01:26:11,582
- What's this about "we're family"?
- Tell you later.

1082
01:26:11,825 --> 01:26:15,226
- It's not set in stone!
- I'll lead the way, enter.

1083
01:26:18,031 --> 01:26:20,966
At one point,
we see a brig pass by...

1084
01:26:21,435 --> 01:26:24,302
we get up and shout out "help"!

1085
01:26:24,671 --> 01:26:27,367
Nothing, we were on our last legs.

1086
01:26:27,641 --> 01:26:31,543
When we'd lost hope,
they turned back and came to get us.

1087
01:26:31,645 --> 01:26:34,113
We were elated,
but we get on board and...

1088
01:26:34,348 --> 01:26:35,610
They were pirates!

1089
01:26:35,749 --> 01:26:38,479
The same thing happened
to my mother's uncle!

1090
01:26:40,287 --> 01:26:44,986
They sent us below deck, four days
and nights of bread and water...

1091
01:26:45,125 --> 01:26:48,253
we arrive in Algiers. You should see
how nice it is, Martino.

1092
01:26:48,362 --> 01:26:49,920
Nice!

1093
01:26:50,664 --> 01:26:53,895
Even if it was terrifying,
they took us to the medina...

1094
01:26:53,967 --> 01:26:56,333
and sold us to a merchant,
Mustafa...

1095
01:26:56,770 --> 01:26:58,169
a good man!

1096
01:26:58,438 --> 01:27:01,566
He made us unload bales
of fabric day and night...

1097
01:27:01,708 --> 01:27:03,903
but we ate well together...

1098
01:27:04,111 --> 01:27:06,909
there were musicians and dancers...

1099
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:08,479
what beauties...

1100
01:27:08,815 --> 01:27:11,477
The famous bayadere beauties, right?

1101
01:27:11,685 --> 01:27:14,552
- Would you shut up!
- I'll shut up.

1102
01:27:15,822 --> 01:27:18,916
- Who decided he's family now?
- It's not set in stone.

1103
01:27:19,793 --> 01:27:23,285
Brother, an experience
worth writing a book about.

1104
01:27:24,431 --> 01:27:26,865
- Write!
- I learned lots of Arabic words.

1105
01:27:34,608 --> 01:27:36,439
It means "My love, I love you."

1106
01:27:36,877 --> 01:27:38,469
What were you up to?

1107
01:27:42,649 --> 01:27:46,244
Shut up,
you've never even been there!

1108
01:27:46,787 --> 01:27:48,311
What's going on outside?

1109
01:27:48,689 --> 01:27:51,157
Everybody's running toward
the fortress.

1110
01:28:16,316 --> 01:28:19,479
In positions!?

1111
01:28:30,530 --> 01:28:33,192
Present arms!?

1112
01:28:37,371 --> 01:28:38,531
Brogi?

1113
01:28:39,506 --> 01:28:40,700
Falaschi?

1114
01:28:41,174 --> 01:28:42,539
Foresi?

1115
01:28:43,243 --> 01:28:45,973
The son of Beppe the miller.

1116
01:28:46,513 --> 01:28:49,004
- What's your name?
- Lucianino, Maestro sir.

1117
01:28:49,082 --> 01:28:50,140
- Stop it.
- That's right.

1118
01:28:50,484 --> 01:28:52,111
Aren't you ashamed?

1119
01:28:52,319 --> 01:28:55,288
- The condemned cannot speak.
- Silence! Shut up!

1120
01:28:55,422 --> 01:28:57,549
- He told us to be ashamed.
- Shut up!

1121
01:28:57,624 --> 01:29:01,583
You start off as bootlickers
and end up assassins.

1122
01:29:01,962 --> 01:29:04,590
Look who's talking, Maestro,
you wanted to kill!

1123
01:29:04,698 --> 01:29:07,968
Don't call me Maestro!
Did I teach you to become beasts?

1124
01:29:07,968 --> 01:29:13,201
We shouldn't kill anyone,
not even Napoleon, he's done good!

1125
01:29:13,273 --> 01:29:15,434
- Silence! Shut up!
- He's a good man.

1126
01:29:15,509 --> 01:29:17,670
Look at the good he's done to me.

1127
01:29:17,778 --> 01:29:20,576
You asked for it!

1128
01:29:21,114 --> 01:29:23,947
I agree with him,
we shouldn't hurt people.

1129
01:29:24,117 --> 01:29:26,210
Tell it to those cowards.

1130
01:29:26,653 --> 01:29:30,020
I repeated the right ideas to you
over and over...

1131
01:29:30,390 --> 01:29:34,588
but you have heads
and hearts of stone.

1132
01:29:34,694 --> 01:29:37,720
- Stop it! Stay back!
- You shut up!

1133
01:29:37,798 --> 01:29:39,163
He can't speak!

1134
01:29:39,266 --> 01:29:41,962
You think shooting people
doesn't make us suffer?

1135
01:29:42,102 --> 01:29:44,764
- We do it if it's necessary!
- Get ready!

1136
01:29:44,838 --> 01:29:49,104
Obey your commander,
that's all you know how to do.

1137
01:29:49,376 --> 01:29:53,437
- Slaves!
Prepare arms! Attention!

1138
01:29:53,513 --> 01:29:56,539
Do as he commands, you duffers!

1139
01:29:56,783 --> 01:29:59,684
Shoot, you animals, you beasts!

1140
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:01,478
Ass-kissers!

1141
01:30:02,422 --> 01:30:03,787
What are you waiting?

1142
01:30:03,857 --> 01:30:04,824
Shoot!

1143
01:30:12,332 --> 01:30:14,562
Happy now?

1144
01:30:20,974 --> 01:30:24,569
Maestro, did you get
what you wanted?

1145
01:30:33,453 --> 01:30:35,318
No!?

1146
01:30:35,689 --> 01:30:37,554
No!?

1147
01:30:37,824 --> 01:30:39,155
Damn you all!

1148
01:30:41,595 --> 01:30:43,290
Assassins!

1149
01:30:46,233 --> 01:30:47,700
Traitor!

1150
01:30:48,134 --> 01:30:49,624
Assassin!

1151
01:30:49,836 --> 01:30:53,294
Assassin! Assassin!

1152
01:32:30,604 --> 01:32:31,935
Death to the tyrant.

1153
01:32:33,406 --> 01:32:34,634
Long live freedom.

1154
01:32:39,346 --> 01:32:40,404
He fled...

1155
01:32:41,114 --> 01:32:42,513
He fled!

1156
01:32:43,516 --> 01:32:45,074
He fled!

1157
01:32:47,721 --> 01:32:48,813
Where is he?

1158
01:32:50,557 --> 01:32:51,489
Where is he?

1159
01:32:53,326 --> 01:32:54,315
Where is he?

1160
01:32:56,262 --> 01:33:00,722
Damn him, he pretended he'd construct
roads and buildings...

1161
01:33:02,135 --> 01:33:06,970
Champagne for two!
He must've slept with some whore...

1162
01:33:55,822 --> 01:33:58,188
Dearest Martino...

1163
01:33:58,958 --> 01:34:02,951
I've longed to write you every day
but never had the nerve to...

1164
01:34:03,363 --> 01:34:05,194
so much time has passed...

1165
01:34:05,331 --> 01:34:09,358
who knows how much longer
I'll have to tell you this...

1166
01:34:12,439 --> 01:34:14,771
I allowed myself to be conquered
by the Emperor...

1167
01:34:14,974 --> 01:34:18,000
because I was certain
I had conquered him.

1168
01:34:18,178 --> 01:34:20,373
You fell for it tooo don't deny it.

1169
01:34:20,747 --> 01:34:22,647
That man is conquered
by himself only.

1170
01:34:22,816 --> 01:34:26,775
- Enough, I'm getting soaked.
- But so am I!

1171
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:29,616
You're subordinate, get soaked.

1172
01:34:29,689 --> 01:34:33,648
- Get off your high horse!
- He thinks he's family too...

1173
01:34:35,261 --> 01:34:39,163
Boss, all set,
the wagon's almost loaded.

1174
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,791
- Go then.
- It's raining.

1175
01:34:43,002 --> 01:34:45,095
- So get wet.
- Can't I wait a bit?

1176
01:34:46,372 --> 01:34:48,966
- Go!
- I'll get sick.

1177
01:34:50,744 --> 01:34:52,735
After we fled from Elba...

1178
01:34:53,146 --> 01:34:55,614
in 100 days he formed an army...

1179
01:34:55,915 --> 01:34:58,383
he wono torchedo killed...

1180
01:34:58,585 --> 01:35:02,885
he was defeatedo
and sent to a remote island...

1181
01:35:03,089 --> 01:35:05,523
let's hope it's forever this time.

1182
01:35:05,725 --> 01:35:08,250
But meanwhileo
there were 70o000 more deaths.

1183
01:35:08,461 --> 01:35:10,793
The load for Porto Longone
is setting sail.

1184
01:35:10,864 --> 01:35:12,331
Good job.

1185
01:35:12,966 --> 01:35:14,058
Very well, good.

1186
01:35:14,134 --> 01:35:16,659
I've just finished chapter 54...

1187
01:35:17,570 --> 01:35:19,060
the arrival in Algiers.

1188
01:35:19,372 --> 01:35:21,806
- What chapter did you read up to?
- 50.

1189
01:35:21,875 --> 01:35:22,842
Bravo, thank you.

1190
01:35:22,942 --> 01:35:24,273
18 pages.

1191
01:35:25,678 --> 01:35:28,909
Last night I wrote about
when we were sold at the market.

1192
01:35:29,082 --> 01:35:31,277
You're blocking my flow.

1193
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:33,677
Talk to me later.

1194
01:35:34,687 --> 01:35:36,678
Here. Martino?

1195
01:35:36,756 --> 01:35:39,953
Remember,
your opinion means a lot to me.

1196
01:35:40,393 --> 01:35:44,557
I've written 300 pages
and my head's still chock-full!

1197
01:35:44,664 --> 01:35:47,565
We'll make another trip
for the barrels of Aleatico wine.

1198
01:35:48,334 --> 01:35:51,633
You handle it,
you're good, thank you!

1199
01:35:51,704 --> 01:35:53,296
I'll come for the pages later.

1200
01:35:55,041 --> 01:35:59,410
"Suddenly, a vessel so grand
appeared before our eyes...

1201
01:36:00,847 --> 01:36:02,337
A grand vessel."

1202
01:36:04,484 --> 01:36:07,783
My Waterloo
occurred shortly after his.

1203
01:36:08,054 --> 01:36:12,855
If we crossed pathso
you wouldn't recognize me.

1204
01:36:13,660 --> 01:36:17,596
I have gray hairs
and more wrinkles around my eyes.

1205
01:36:18,164 --> 01:36:19,597
I'll take that.

1206
01:36:21,134 --> 01:36:24,661
Give me him, you'll scare him.

1207
01:36:24,904 --> 01:36:27,668
He's mine too. Darling?

1208
01:36:27,740 --> 01:36:31,369
Isn't he the spitting image
of my father's uncle?

1209
01:36:31,911 --> 01:36:35,608
- You're sick, you half-wit.
- Look at his profile.

1210
01:36:36,382 --> 01:36:40,648
When I feel sado I hope
you're not as precious anymore...

1211
01:36:40,854 --> 01:36:42,321
my dear Martino.

1212
01:36:42,555 --> 01:36:46,116
I hope you've grown bald
and have a potbelly.

1213
01:36:46,993 --> 01:36:50,429
If you write backo
I beg you to tell me it is so.

1214
01:36:51,164 --> 01:36:53,064
Actuallyo there's no need to reply.

1215
01:36:54,434 --> 01:36:59,030
Let's forget about it and remain
what we were for each other.

1216
01:36:59,839 --> 01:37:01,898
Farewello Emilia.

1217
01:37:10,783 --> 01:37:14,082
How nice, breakfast in bed!

1218
01:37:14,687 --> 01:37:15,915
Thank you.

1219
01:37:20,059 --> 01:37:24,086
- Did you sleep well?
- He kept kicking!

1220
01:37:24,797 --> 01:37:26,355
You can feel him now.

1221
01:37:27,166 --> 01:37:28,997
He can't wait to get out.

1222
01:37:30,336 --> 01:37:31,667
How odd.

1223
01:37:32,605 --> 01:37:34,072
Where was it again?

1224
01:37:34,841 --> 01:37:37,674
Your sister found it
under the donkey's hay.

1225
01:37:39,679 --> 01:37:40,805
Odd!

1226
01:37:41,981 --> 01:37:43,710
I'm so happy!

1227
01:37:45,084 --> 01:37:46,381
Really, really happy!

1228
01:38:26,392 --> 01:38:31,694
GIORGIO FONTANELLI
MAESTRO AND PROFESSOR

1229
01:38:37,937 --> 01:38:39,131
Goodbye, Maestro.

1230
01:39:27,854 --> 01:39:30,982
"He felt destiny imposed
a new task upon him...

1231
01:39:31,057 --> 01:39:32,285
a definitive task."

1232
01:39:32,825 --> 01:39:35,953
"He said goodbye to his family
and left for St. Helena...

1233
01:39:36,029 --> 01:39:37,587
but he got there too late."

1234
01:39:39,932 --> 01:39:43,800
IT WAS MAY 6, 1821

1235
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:50,034
"...MAN IS NOT RESPECTED
FOR HIS GARMENTS

1236
01:39:50,109 --> 01:39:53,704
BUT FOR HOW MANY TYRANT'S SCALPS
HE HANDLES." S.E. V RASPINI
