1
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,570
Come on, champ. You ain't so bad!

2
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:28,420
Come on!

3
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:32,490
Come on!

4
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,650
You're out!

5
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,290
We made a deal.

6
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,720
I know, but this is extremely crazy.

7
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,030
Yeah, it's mentally irregular.

8
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,720
But it makes sense.

9
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,920
You owe me a favor.

10
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,890
I know, but when did you think of this?

11
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,660
About three years ago

12
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,600
This is very crazy, Apollo

13
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:11,730
Look, Stallion

14
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,800
you won that last fight by one second

15
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,430
You beat me by one second.

16
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,550
That's very hard for a man of my intelligence to handle

17
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,350
Is it? Didn't you say afterwards

18
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,120
you learned how to live with it?

19
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,710
I lied.You lied

20
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,580
So now you have to prove it to yourself?

21
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,780
Just for myself. No TV or newspapers,

22
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,950
just you and me.

23
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,950
Nothing. Just you and me.

24
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,220
Age before beautyAnything you say, son.

25
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,490
I do all the work.

26
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,480
You better go slow.

27
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,860
You ain't as young as springtime no more.

28
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,360
I'm still young enough to whip your butt.

29
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,770
Yeah? How will you do that?

30
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,010
You taught me everything you know.

31
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,600
Almost everything

32
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,300
Remember, you fight great

33
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:55,150
but I'm a great fighter, you ready

34
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,440
Absolutely.All right.

35
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,010
You know, Stallion.

36
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,850
It's too bad we have to get old, yeah?

37
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,830
Just keep punching, Apollo.

38
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,090
Want to ring the bell?

39
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,500
All right.

40
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,240
Come on!

41
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,670
Come on!

42
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,070
You really move good for an older guy.

43
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,470
Look at him fly.Look out.

44
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,780
No, you don't want any of this.

45
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,720
Maybe I'm in here with the wrong guy.

46
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,400
Dad, you're late.

47
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,200
Mom's going to yell at you.

48
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,370
How you doing? Fine.

49
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,010
Don't you think that's a little bright? A little bit.

50
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,010
Where'd you get that hat?

51
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,180
A friend gave it to me. Like it?

52
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,550
Who punched you in the eye?

53
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,720
Same friend.

54
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,850
That's weird. Better hurry, Dad

55
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,190
You know, you're developing a very loud personality.

56
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,760
Don't go too fast or you'll get out of focus

57
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:22,890
Really?

58
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:27,770
Yo.

59
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,320
Yo, It's about time.

60
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,140
I'm sorry I'm late.

61
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,870
Why don't you get ready to eat, ok?

62
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,080
You're here. Now stop calling him name

63
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,910
You been calling me names?

64
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,610
We wait any longer, it will be my next birthday

65
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,720
Where have you been?

66
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,250
Out getting punched.

67
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,450
Bring the cake in here,

68
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,690
and let's get the celebration underway.

69
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,220
I'm hungry.

70
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,190
Babe, get the cake. He'll love it.

71
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,610
We have a great surprise for you.

72
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,960
You'll love this cake, ok?

73
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,260
You'll love your present, Uncle Paulie.

74
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,430
Where is it?

75
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,830
Let me set the mood here. I have to turn the lights down.

76
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,970
Watch this

77
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,670
It's parked in the driveway?

78
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,470
Just be patient, would you?

79
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,510
I'm so excited, I'm sweating.

80
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,380
I feel like I'm going into a big fight.

81
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,130
Happy birthday, Paulie.

82
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,500
What the hell is this?

83
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,800
Your present.

84
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,420
I wanted a sports car for my birthday.

85
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,070
not a walking trash can.

86
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,680
Come on, he looks great here.

87
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,840
This is extremely psycho.

88
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,610
Since you don't have any friends, we thought you'd like it.

89
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,750
Yeah. Pretend you're happy. It'll keep you company when you're all alone.

90
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,150
That's a great-looking guy.

91
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,720
Please make a wish

92
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,690
It's creepy! That thing talks!

93
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,120
Creepy? These things are great! I wish I had one when I was growing up.

94
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,390
Make a wish, like he said.

95
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,460
I wish I wasn't in this nightmare.

96
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,560
A very classy wish.

97
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,130
What do you think?

98
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,130
Very good.

99
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,300
Want to help me put out this forest fire?

100
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,340
Sure.

101
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,940
On the count of three. One

102
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,340
Two

103
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,380
Three

104
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,680
They're out.

105
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,550
You drowned me!

106
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,380
Don't worry.

107
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:31,490
I'll clean it up for you, Paulie.

108
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,660
Rocky.

109
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,230
Yeah, you noticed.

110
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,770
What are you doing with that cake?

111
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,900
The party ain't over yet.

112
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,420
Still got to celebrate.

113
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,900
It's a special night.

114
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,510
Yeah, it's Wednesday.

115
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,740
It's definitely Wednesday.

116
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,680
but in case you forgot.

117
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,990
it's almost been nine years since you married me.

118
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,150
so here's your prize.

119
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,050
But our anniversary's a week away.

120
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,120
That's true. But why wait?

121
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:04,490
Has it been that rough? No.

122
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,460
It's been excellent.

123
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,560
Open your prize. Go on.

124
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,500
All right.

125
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,840
Do you like it?

126
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:18,940
It's beautiful.All right.

127
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,270
I was so nervous. I didn't know.

128
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,740
I hope you like it.

129
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,940
The guy I bought it from says.

130
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,920
even if it looks like a snake, don't worry.

131
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,860
It won't bite you.

132
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,860
It's beautiful.

133
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,560
You know what's amazing?

134
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,490
After all these years.

135
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,130
everything still seems kind of new.

136
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,270
You remember a long time ago I told you that

137
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,240
you ain't never getting rid of me.

138
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,340
remember that?

139
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,610
You're not.

140
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,550
You're never getting rid of me.

141
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,280
Happy almost anniversary.

142
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,330
Can you answer a few questions?

143
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,700
How long you here for?

144
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,000
We talk later, please.

145
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,470
When are you fighting, Drago?

146
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,240
We talk it later.

147
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,000
Is it definite the Soviet Union

148
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,250
will enter professional boxing?

149
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:28,740
Please, no more talk now.

150
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,960
We will talk at press conference.

151
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:33,310
Do you know where it will be held?

152
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,390
We talk it later.

153
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,830
Today may have proved to be a landmark in sports history.

154
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,860
After unraveling years of red tape,

155
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,330
Russia will now throw its hat into the ring.

156
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,630
The prize ring, that is.

157
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,700
The introductions were made by his wife Ludmilla Vobet Drago.

158
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,670
She was the double gold medalist in swimming.

159
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,710
Today the Soviet Union has officially entered professional boxing.

160
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,210
My husband and great undefeated heavyweight world amateur champion

161
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,980
Captain Ivan Drago.

162
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,350
has come with his trainers to America

163
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,890
to compete as an international sportsman and ambassador of goodwill.

164
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,430
Has Drago ever boxed against a real professional?

165
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,100
From having been trained in Russia by great boxing coach, Manuel Vega

166
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:28,530
and now by Sergei Rimsky, we hope he's qualified to do so.

167
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,570
Hope?

168
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,670
Well, I know he is, but I don't want to sound too confident.

169
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,910
If possible, we would like to

170
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,250
have an exhibition bout with your famous champion Rocky Balboa.

171
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:42,720
What makes you think he can fight someone as seasoned as Balboa?

172
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:45,490
No one can match his strength, his endurance

173
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,090
or his aggressiveness.

174
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,420
You sound like he's indestructible.

175
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,390
Yes, he is.

176
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,420
Well. Can this mammoth Russian,

177
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,630
already nicknamed the Siberian Express,

178
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,600
wreak havoc among the professional heavyweight ranks?

179
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,230
Whoever he fights first,

180
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,140
it'll be one hot ticket.

181
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:06,910
We'll be right back with a check on today's pro football scoreboard.

182
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,180
Dad, when can I learn to fight?

183
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,210
I can't hear you. What?

184
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,850
I want to learn to fight.

185
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,320
Could you turn your robot down?

186
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,090
You see I fight,

187
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,820
so you don't have to fight.

188
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,230
I want you to use your head for something

189
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,560
instead of a punching bag like I do.

190
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:28,860
Your head doesn't look like a punching bag.

191
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:32,000
That's nice. Thanks a lot.

192
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,670
It looks like a catcher's mitt.

193
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,440
A wise guy.

194
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:40,110
Mr. Balboa, Mr. Creed's on the phone.

195
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,790
Yeah? I'll be right there.

196
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,810
You can get it right here.

197
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,580
I hope it's not another rematch.

198
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,880
Don't worry about it.

199
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,580
Hello? Yeah, Apollo.

200
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,350
Turn that down. How are you doing?

201
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,120
Yeah? You're coming out?

202
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,920
That's great. What am I doing?

203
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:00,730
I'm just getting dizzy.

204
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:07,430
My husband and I thank you for coming to our training quarters today.

205
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,670
As you can see, it is highly advanced

206
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,110
and we wish to show the American press a small portion

207
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,540
of the advances our country's made

208
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,880
in the technology of human performance.

209
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:21,210
Coach Rimsky, what does all this do to enhance performance?

210
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:24,020
Well...If I may answer.

211
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:27,320
It makes a man a better man

212
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:32,130
a great athlete a super athlete by harnessing all his strength.

213
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:36,400
Though most of the world is ignorant in body chemistry,

214
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:38,870
we wish to educate your country.

215
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,960
There have been rumors of doping

216
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:44,440
and distribution of anabolic steroids in the Soviet Union.

217
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,740
Has Drago partaken in any such experiments?

218
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,410
No, Ivan in naturally trained.

219
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:52,650
Then how do you explain his freakish strength?

220
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:57,660
Like your Popeye, he ate his spinach every day.

221
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,990
Shall we have a demonstration?

222
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,820
Please do.Thank you.

223
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:07,230
A normal heavyweight

224
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,070
averages 700 pounds of pressure per square inch.

225
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:24,540
Drago averages 1850 pounds.

226
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,410
So the result is quite obvious.

227
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,280
What results are those?

228
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:32,190
Whatever he hits, he destroys.

229
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,630
He's big and he's strong, but he's clumsy.

230
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,930
I know I can beat him.

231
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,030
Why do you want to fight again?

232
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,300
It's something I believe in.

233
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,670
You can do your homework.

234
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,970
Okay. Later, Dad.

235
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,040
Later, Uncle Paulie, Apollo.

236
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,270
Later, big man.See you later, kiddo.

237
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,810
Don't you think people are expecting to see Rocky whack this bum out first?

238
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,080
Yeah, and he will when it's for real.

239
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:02,550
This is just an exhibition bout. It's kid stuff.

240
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,890
What's the purpose?

241
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,220
What's worth getting hurt for?

242
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,960
What the hell is that?

243
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:15,500
That's my girl.

244
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,740
Thanks, honey.You're welcome.

245
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,900
Nice song.

246
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:27,810
It's my favorite. You're the greatest.

247
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,380
See you, sport.

248
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,640
See you.

249
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:34,780
Paulie, who taught it to talk like that?

250
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,910
She loves me.

251
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,720
Like I was saying,

252
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:47,990
I don't want this chump to come here with all that hype

253
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,680
trying to make us look bad.

254
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,300
They try every other way.

255
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,530
With Rock's help, we can get great media coverage,

256
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,900
We can make them look bad

257
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,040
I think it's wrong.

258
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:59,470
It's never been more right.

259
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,890
You're a great fighter,

260
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,440
but you've been retired for five years.

261
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,340
Don't you think it's time to think about something else?

262
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,750
How much can you take?

263
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,260
Either of you.

264
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:15,090
I'll get the coffee.

265
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:19,490
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

266
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,160
I just care about you both.

267
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,010
You ever try these comics?

268
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,070
No.

269
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,470
Keeps your fertility.

270
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,810
Paulie.

271
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,720
This was a great fight.

272
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:46,250
Great? I'm getting punchy just watching.

273
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,760
What you using for a chin there, Stallion?

274
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,400
I should have slipped that one.

275
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:55,760
Yeah, You definitely should have slipped.

276
00:14:55,770 --> 00:15:00,870
It's crazy how people care about you when you're in that ring bleeding,

277
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,170
but once you step out of that ring, you're ancient history.

278
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,940
You ain't ancient history.

279
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:09,480
Nobody's asking for autographs.

280
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:14,750
Apollo, Can I ask you something?

281
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,950
What?

282
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,950
You know this fight you're having against the Russian.

283
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:23,260
Do you think maybe it ain't against him?

284
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:27,690
If it's not him, then who is it against?

285
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:32,870
Do you think maybe it's like you against you?

286
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,030
No, I think you really are getting brain damaged.

287
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,420
That's what I think.

288
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,740
Yeah, maybe, but

289
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,370
I'm speaking the truth, Apollo.

290
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,350
Are you? Yeah.

291
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,610
I don't think I want to hear this.

292
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,250
Come on, Apollo.

293
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,420
you're a great fighter. No doubt about that.

294
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:52,320
But we have to face the facts too.

295
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:55,050
You don't want to believe it, but maybe the show is over.

296
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:58,290
That's easy for you to say. You're still on top.

297
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,390
What happens when you're not on top? Then what?

298
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,230
Where do we go? We sure can't be born again.

299
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:10,400
I know we can't be born again, but we have to change sometime.

300
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:13,070
I don't want to change! I like who I am!

301
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,810
I like who you are too, but look at that.

302
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,880
You don't want to believe this, but that ain't us no more.

303
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:22,420
We can't do that the way we did before.

304
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:25,850
We're changing. We're turning into regular people.

305
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,790
No, maybe you think you're changing.

306
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,160
but you can't change what you really are.

307
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:36,700
Forget all this money and stuff around you. It don't change a thing.

308
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:40,830
You and me don't even have a choice.

309
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,900
We're born with a killer instinct,

310
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:46,640
you can't turn off and on like a radio.

311
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:50,280
We have to be in the middle of the action because we're warriors.

312
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:53,450
Without some challenge, without some war to fight

313
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:57,820
then the warrior may as well be dead.

314
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,960
So I'm asking you,

315
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:06,100
as a friend,

316
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,570
stand by my side this one last time.

317
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:18,410
You're a great talker, Apollo.

318
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,290
All right, but when this is over.

319
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,850
You know me, Stallion.

320
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,450
I always think of something else.

321
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,660
That's what I'm afraid of.

322
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,790
All right, you have a deal.

323
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,090
I feel sorry for that guy.

324
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,060
Apollo, what made you decide to put on an exhibition with Drago?

325
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:45,870
Call it a sense of responsibility.

326
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,830
Responsibility, how?

327
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,770
I have to teach this young fellow how to box American style.

328
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,170
Isn't Drago a little inexperienced to be in the same ring?

329
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:59,710
Some folks have to learn the hard way.

330
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,710
No knockout prediction?

331
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,220
I'm not angry with him.

332
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,950
I just want to show the world

333
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,450
Russia doesn't have all the best athletes.

334
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:12,060
How do you think Apollo should fight Drago?

335
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:17,530
Personally, the first thing you need is a ladder.

336
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:22,670
How does it feel to spar with the great former champion?

337
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:27,440
The man's tongue didn't come through customs.

338
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:32,440
My husband is very happy to have this opportunity.

339
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:33,880
It's his dream.

340
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:35,480
Dream. How do you mean?

341
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,550
In our country, Apollo Creed is well-known and very respected.

342
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,990
It could be a good victory.

343
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,230
Wait a minute. Win?

344
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:49,330
You don't really think you're going to whip me, do you?

345
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,930
He didn't come here to lose.

346
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,000
You hold on, little lady.

347
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:55,670
Lose and lose royally he will do.

348
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,940
How can you be so sure?

349
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,370
I've been with best, I've beaten the best.

350
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,510
I've retired more men than Social Security.

351
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,890
Excuse, please.

352
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,490
You are not very realistic.

353
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:07,570
Where did you come from?

354
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:08,620
What are you talking about?

355
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,790
You can box, yes,

356
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,630
but you are far too old to think you can win over Drago.

357
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:13,820
Is that a fact?

358
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:16,020
Yes, and it could be a painful one.

359
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,830
You put that heavy bag without balls in the ring with me

360
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,700
and you'll see the meaning of pain!

361
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,360
Why do you insult us?

362
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:22,830
You just hold on here.

363
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,390
Don't make me out as the bad guy.

364
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,740
I came to talk about a friendly exhibition bout till you started up.

365
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,470
come right the big mouth body

366
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,900
You are the aggressor! This is obvious!

367
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,810
I wish to say to the press in all fairness,

368
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,610
Drago should not even fight this man,

369
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,480
He is a has-been!

370
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:41,420
You get that big chump in the ring right now!

371
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,820
Bring it on. I don't want to hear her.

372
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:48,620
Just let that chump go.

373
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,760
All right

374
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:55,460
I said what I feel.

375
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,060
We'll finish this in the ring.

376
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,530
You understand? Whatever you like.

377
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:01,100
You and all your puppets just shut up!

378
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:03,500
You are history, chump.

379
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,470
How did I do?

380
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,670
A little loud for my taste.

381
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,980
But good? Yeah, very good.

382
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,010
Welcome one and all to the city of lights

383
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:16,180
Las Vegas,

384
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,180
and one of the most unusual events in years

385
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,690
East meets West.

386
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,360
Age versus youth in a goodwill exhibition match

387
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,490
as the former champion Apollo Creed

388
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,160
takes on a mountain of muscle from the Soviet Union

389
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:31,500
Ivan Drago.

390
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,830
Come on.Patience is a virtue.

391
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,300
I'm ready to rock and roll.

392
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:38,570
I understand, but you need your equipment. There you go.

393
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,470
Now you look like a mummy.

394
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,340
I feel like a mummy.Does it feel okay?

395
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,840
It feels great. I could eat nails.

396
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:47,010
I never tried them things.

397
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,350
What?

398
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,490
I never had snails.

399
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,460
I seen them in the garden, but I never wanted to eat them.

400
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,650
I didn't say anything about snails. I said, "nails,"

401
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,060
Nail. Stallion. Yeah

402
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,790
You look pretty good

403
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,630
but do me a favor when you go up there

404
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,670
Try not to wear yourself out

405
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,670
Yeah, wear myself out

406
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,700
It's just that you haven't been in the ring for five years

407
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,410
I just want you to maintain a bit

408
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,110
You sound like I'm an old man

409
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,740
I'm in the best shape of my life. I'm stronger. I'm quicker

410
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:22,950
I'm not saying you're not ready

411
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,250
but, personally, if it were me

412
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,490
I wouldn't mind postponing it a couple weeks

413
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:29,790
Postpone? Yeah

414
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:34,560
Come on, we don't really know anything about this guy you're fighting

415
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:38,200
Let's say I postpone.

416
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:41,500
I pull out, somebody else steps in and whips this chump

417
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,800
Where does that leave me? What do you mean?

418
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:44,600
It's just some exhibition fight.

419
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,770
This don't mean nothing

420
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,110
No, that's where you're wrong

421
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,640
This is not just an exhibition that doesn't mean anything

422
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:55,590
This is us against them. Come on

423
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,680
Stallion

424
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,910
maybe you don't know

425
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:03,060
what I'm talking about now

426
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:06,290
but you will when it's over

427
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:10,900
Believe me, you will when it's over!

428
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:21,840
Drago

429
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,100
Good luck.

430
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:53,550
I hope after we can be friend.

431
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,570
I hope so

432
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,570
Of course.

433
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:01,610
They're sportsmen, not soldiers.

434
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:04,120
Enjoy the fight

435
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,750
Good evening, everyone.

436
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,850
Along with Warner Wolf, I'm Stu Nahan

437
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,650
We welcome you to a most unusual event

438
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,180
For the first time,

439
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,430
West against East in professional sports.

440
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,930
Thanks for getting me here.

441
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,260
I owe you one.

442
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,760
No, we're even

443
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:36,700
God, I feel born again

444
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:39,970
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome

445
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:44,270
I would like to announce the presence of a true fighting champion

446
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,910
that defines the word courage

447
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:51,450
The Italian Stallion, Rocky Balboa

448
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:54,610
Excuse me, would you

449
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,820
Certainly

450
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:00,590
Rocky

451
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:06,430
Tonight's special event features

452
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:08,590
two great athletes

453
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:13,030
In the blue corner weighing 221 pounds

454
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,130
the former heavyweight champion of the world

455
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,640
the Dancing Destroyer

456
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:21,070
the King of Sting

457
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,740
the Count of Monte Fisto

458
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,080
You think you have enough names?

459
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:27,180
Be patient. We're almost done

460
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:29,980
The Master of Disaster, the one and only

461
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:33,060
Apollo Creed!

462
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,830
The crowd anticipating a great fight.

463
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:40,600
Apollo is playing to the crowd.

464
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,800
In the red corner

465
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:50,270
weighing an even 261 pounds

466
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:54,570
gold medalist and undefeated world amateur champion

467
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:57,340
from the Soviet Union

468
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:00,380
the Siberian Bull

469
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:03,960
Ivan Drago!

470
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,920
I want you!

471
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:11,160
I want you!

472
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:13,390
The two fighters come to the center of the ring

473
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,960
for the instructions from referee Lou Filippo.

474
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:17,460
You boys know the rules

475
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:20,730
Watch your low blows, kidney punches, rabbit punches

476
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,790
In case of a knockdown,

477
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,370
you go to the corner I tell you

478
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,470
and you stay there until I tell you to come out

479
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,410
Shake hands and let's have a good fight

480
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:30,180
It's time to go to school, son

481
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,400
Get your hands up.

482
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:32,880
Do you need an interpreter?

483
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,450
It's time to go to school

484
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,960
You will lose

485
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,990
All right

486
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,630
The bad blood between these two

487
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,190
can be felt all over this arena.

488
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,500
I can't get over the size of this Russian

489
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:54,770
It's show time!

490
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,790
Excuse me.

491
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,480
Didn't you forget something?

492
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,740
Come on

493
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:01,040
Apollo seems to be in great spirits tonight

494
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:05,340
He's really putting on a show for this capacity crowd

495
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:07,680
Be back in a minute

496
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,420
Round one

497
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:14,020
Creed dancing around Creed backpedaling now

498
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,820
He's been away five years

499
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:19,130
Don't wait him, get out first.

500
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,930
Come on

501
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,430
Come on

502
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,230
Neither fighter ready to throw a punch

503
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,490
A left jab there.

504
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:35,480
A left jab once again by Creed.

505
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,780
A slip by Creed

506
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:39,310
This is bizarre

507
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,540
Creed is over the hill,

508
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:46,650
and the Russian hasn't fought anybody.

509
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:54,560
Keep moving! Stick him! Apollo.

510
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:56,130
Drago moving in again

511
00:29:56,140 --> 00:30:00,000
A left hand by Creed and another. Drago moves away

512
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:02,470
Come on

513
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:06,680
Get your hands up!

514
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,030
Another left hand by Creed!

515
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:13,710
Drago waiting, cocking that right hand.

516
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:19,320
Get out there!

517
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:21,350
Get out of there!

518
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,750
And a left hand!

519
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,960
He's taking some punishment now!

520
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:25,690
Drago moves him against the ropes!

521
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,630
Tie him up now!

522
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:31,460
Now the Russian throws Creed across the ring!

523
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,200
Move!

524
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:34,400
It is Drago with the upper hand!

525
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:36,640
Drago with a left to the midsection!

526
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,800
Get out of that corner!

527
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:39,540
Another right and another right!

528
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:43,010
Another right, another right!

529
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:47,080
Creed is against the ropes!

530
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:49,150
They step in and stop it!

531
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,150
What are you guys doing?

532
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,950
This is supposed to be an exhibition! You understand?

533
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,550
Just an exhibition!

534
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,290
A tremendous end to the first round by the Russian

535
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:02,430
And a very bloody Apollo Creed

536
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,800
The Soviet's strength is incredible!

537
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:07,670
Champ, I have to stop you

538
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,130
This fight's finished. I have to call it

539
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,040
Champ, you can't do no more out there

540
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:13,140
I'm here to fight

541
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:15,040
He's killing you. I have to stop this thing.

542
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:15,980
I'm here to fight.

543
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:18,180
Promise me you won't stop this fight.

544
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:21,850
That was a pulverizing round for the ex-champion

545
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:26,890
Ivan Drago is definitely for real.

546
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:31,390
Don't stop this fight no matter what

547
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,830
no matter what

548
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:48,710
Creed comes out for round two, dancing around.

549
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,580
The legs appear to be still a little rubbery

550
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,280
Get your hands up

551
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:55,150
Get your hands up

552
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,450
Now it is the Russian just standing there.

553
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:00,820
The Russian trying to intimidate Creed.

554
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,090
The Russian throws a right hand and staggers Creed!

555
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:04,300
Another right to the jaw!

556
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:08,460
A left to the head!

557
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:14,200
Creed is being pounded without mercy!

558
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:15,700
Stop the fight!

559
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:17,800
The referee tries to step in

560
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,770
and he's thrown across the ring!

561
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:22,310
Throw the towel!

562
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,940
No

563
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:26,410
I have never seen Apollo take so much punishment!

564
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,910
Throw the damn towel!

565
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,850
No

566
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,790
No

567
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,930
My God!

568
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:51,170
Creed is down!

569
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,610
Apollo could be badly hurt

570
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,810
Let him breathe!

571
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,910
Get move back.Get these guys out of here!

572
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,250
The winner: Ivan Drago

573
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,580
Let me through! Apollo!

574
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,320
I cannot be defeated

575
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:06,650
Is he okay? Somebody get a doctor!

576
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,450
There is no movement by Creed

577
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,520
Get that light off him!

578
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:11,260
I defeat all men

579
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:13,260
Is he dead? Get out of here!

580
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:15,430
It's absolute pandemonium!

581
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,430
Stand back

582
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,960
Let him breathe!

583
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:19,000
You can do it

584
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:20,500
Soon

585
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:22,330
I defeat real champion

586
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,640
Where's the stretcher?

587
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:26,040
Let him breathe!

588
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:29,710
What started out as a joke has turned out to be a disaster

589
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,940
Creed appears to be in very serious condition

590
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:32,980
Is the man alive?

591
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:34,550
You can make it, Apollo.

592
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,850
If he dies, he dies.

593
00:33:56,710 --> 00:34:01,680
There's a lot I could say about this man

594
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,680
I don't know if it matters now

595
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:08,450
I guess what matters is

596
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:11,180
what he stood for

597
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:14,890
what he lived for

598
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,300
and what he died for

599
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,300
You always did everything

600
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:27,270
the way you wanted it

601
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:33,110
I didn't understand that, but

602
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,540
now I understand

603
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:49,150
I'll never forget you, Apollo

604
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:09,240
You're the best

605
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:21,890
Rocky, is the decision final?

606
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,220
Yes.

607
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:26,890
Are you the first to give up his crown?

608
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,060
I don't know about that

609
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:30,630
Doesn the title mean anything to you anymore?

610
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,630
Not until this is over.

611
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:35,230
Coach Rimsky, considering Rocky's known punching power.

612
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,000
do you still think this will be an easy fight?

613
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,410
Yes, of course. It's a matter of size

614
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:44,010
and evolution. Isn't it, gentlemen?

615
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:48,280
Drago is the most perfectly trained athlete ever.

616
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:51,350
This other man has not the size or the endurance

617
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,450
or the genetics to win.

618
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:57,290
It's physically impossible for this little man to win.

619
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:00,630
Drago is a look at the future.

620
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,800
There's been no mention yet, but how much are you making for this fight?

621
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:05,830
No money.

622
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,030
It's not about money.

623
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,300
Has the fight date been set yet?

624
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:10,600
December 25

625
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:11,900
Why Christmas?

626
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:14,480
That's what I was told.Where?

627
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,710
It's in Russia.

628
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,910
Are you nuts?

629
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,270
What's going on?

630
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,480
Why did you agree to this?

631
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:23,080
We fight in Soviet Union or we fight nowhere.

632
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:26,150
Why don't you ask Drago's wife why she is afraid?

633
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,350
Tell them, please.

634
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,410
I'm afraid for my husband's life.

635
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:32,500
We have threats of violence everywhere.

636
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,230
We are not in politics.

637
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:39,800
All I want is for my husband to be safe, to be treated fairly.

638
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:41,160
You call him a killer.

639
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:44,470
He's a professional fighter, not a killer.

640
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,040
You have this belief that you are better than us.

641
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:50,630
You have this belief that this country is so very good

642
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,280
and we are so very bad.

643
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:55,110
You have this belief that you are so fair

644
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:56,580
and we are so cruel.

645
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,420
It's all lies and false propaganda.

646
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:02,850
to support this antagonistic and violent government!

647
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,590
"Violent"?

648
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,060
We don't keep our people behind a wall with machine guns.

649
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:10,500
Who are you? Who am I?

650
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:13,430
I'm the unsilent majority, big mouth!

651
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,100
Good!

652
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,500
Yes, insult us!

653
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:20,540
It's more typical rude behavior toward visiting foreigners

654
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:25,110
But perhaps this simple defeat of this little so-called champion

655
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,550
will be a perfect example

656
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:31,180
of how pathetic and weak your society has become!

657
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:33,280
We go!

658
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,670
Mrs. Balboa!

659
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,640
How do you feel about going to Russia?

660
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:52,210
How does it feel to be part of such a controversial decision?

661
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,270
Did Creed's death make up your husband's mind?

662
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,080
I don't know what you're talking about!

663
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:59,080
why will fight in Christmas?

664
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:00,580
Is it his decision?

665
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,910
When will you go to Russia?

666
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,450
I'm not going to Russia. I don't know what you're talking about.

667
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:11,220
or what you people are doing here.

668
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:45,890
You all right?

669
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,020
Yeah

670
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:48,890
Fine

671
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,470
Why did you do it?

672
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,830
I just have to do what I have to do.

673
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,710
You don't have to do anything

674
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:04,170
No, Adrian, I do.

675
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,380
I have to leave this place too.

676
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:09,850
So where are you going?

677
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:13,650
They said they would let me train in Russia.

678
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:16,320
I just want to go someplace where

679
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:19,190
I won't think of nothing except him

680
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,130
Rocky, give it some time.

681
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:22,260
Don't do this.

682
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:25,260
A lot of people live with hurt.

683
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:27,140
Adrian, a lot of people don't have the choice.

684
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,300
I do.

685
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:31,670
And for that you're willing to lose everything?

686
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,910
This ain't everything

687
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:38,580
This house and the stuff we have

688
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:41,180
ain't everything

689
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:45,450
There's a lot more than this

690
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,960
Before, there were reasons to fight

691
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,120
I could understand.

692
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:49,720
but I don't understand this

693
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:51,430
Even if you win, what have you won?

694
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:54,030
Apollo is still gone.

695
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,590
Why can't you change your thinking?

696
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,250
Everybody else does!

697
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:59,560
Because I'm a fighter

698
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:02,370
That's the way I'm made

699
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,300
That's what you married

700
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:06,270
We can't change what we are

701
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,170
Yes, you can.

702
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,070
You can't change anything.

703
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,320
All we can do is just go with what we are.

704
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,820
You cann't go with what we are.

705
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,250
Have you read the papers?

706
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:17,350
Do you know what everybody says?

707
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,220
Everybody says it's suicide!

708
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:22,220
You've seen him. You know how strong he is

709
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:24,590
You can't win!

710
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:36,370
Adrian always tells the truth

711
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:39,470
Maybe I can't win

712
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:43,840
Maybe the only thing I can do

713
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:47,110
is just take everything he's got

714
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:49,350
But to beat me

715
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,980
he'll have to kill me

716
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:54,520
And to kill me

717
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:58,960
he'll have to have the heart to stand in front of me

718
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:01,690
And to do that

719
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:05,000
he has to be willing to die himself

720
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:08,730
I don't know if he's ready to do that

721
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:11,140
I don't know

722
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,450
I don't know.

723
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:51,530
Be careful with the plaid ones.

724
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:53,790
They belong to the boss.

725
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,490
Did you pack your toothbrush?

726
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,490
You know how tobacco stains your teeth.

727
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,730
If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times.

728
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:05,030
Stop busting my chops

729
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:08,870
I'll have her wires tied when I get back

730
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,970
When will you be back?

731
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:14,840
Pretty soon

732
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:17,470
Are you scared?

733
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,840
No.Yes, you are

734
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:21,980
A little maybe?

735
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:23,850
Wouldn't you be?

736
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:26,420
If a big giant man wanted to beat me up,

737
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:29,190
I'd be real scared.

738
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:36,230
The truth is, sometimes

739
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:39,700
I do get a little scared

740
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:43,230
When I'm in that ring really getting hit

741
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:46,390
and my arms hurt so much I can't lift them

742
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,690
I'm thinking, "God,

743
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:50,930
I wish this guy would hit me on the chin,

744
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:54,030
so I don't feel nothing anymore."

745
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:57,320
Then there's another side that comes out

746
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,510
that isn't so scared.

747
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:02,670
It's another side

748
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:05,240
that wants to take more

749
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:08,850
that wants to go that one more round

750
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:12,050
because by going that one more roundwhen

751
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:14,150
you don't think you can

752
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:17,650
That's what makes all the difference in your life

753
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:20,160
You know what I mean?

754
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,530
Can you remember one more thing?

755
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:25,800
Remember that

756
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:29,370
Daddy thinks you're the best boy in the world

757
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:33,710
And Daddy loves you, no matter what

758
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,330
I have to go now

759
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:47,410
Will you take care of everything

760
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,910
Don't forget to feed your robot

761
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:54,540
Bye, babe

762
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:58,010
Good luck

763
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:00,310
Thanks

764
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:03,780
Come on! The meter's running!

765
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:18,660
What a horrendous flight

766
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:23,430
This is Russia? Don't look so tough

767
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:50,960
Mr. Balboa

768
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:54,530
We take you to quarters now

769
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:56,850
When does the sun come up?

770
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:59,670
This is detrimental to my sinuses.

771
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,830
Weather changes hour to hour.

772
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:03,840
Get used to it.

773
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:05,800
Get in car now

774
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:08,310
We have very long trip.

775
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,750
He sounds like Dracula's cousin.

776
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:13,820
Come on, Paulie.

777
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,940
Like you requested, yes?

778
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:16,940
You requested this dumb location? Yeah

779
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:21,320
Why? You planning to grow reindeer or something?

780
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:24,150
I just wanted to get away from things

781
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,250
The equipment you requested

782
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:28,550
is in barn

783
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:32,960
Who are they? "They"?

784
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:36,430
They are assigned to you

785
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:39,360
Official chaperones.

786
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:42,840
Where you go, they go

787
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:45,970
I have a bad dream here

788
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:48,240
It's okay.It's okay?

789
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:50,380
This is below human standards.

790
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:53,050
There's no antennas. You have to complain.

791
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:55,110
We'll crack out here

792
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:58,650
You have everything I have been instructed to provide

793
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:01,420
We are finished, yes?

794
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:14,740
No sparring?

795
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:20,840
I don't think I need it anymore

796
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:23,610
No sparring? No TV? Nothing?

797
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:27,410
How the heck is he supposed to train around here?

798
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:30,480
No TV. What about the Rose Bowl game?

799
00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:32,420
No room service, I bet.

800
00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:34,860
I hope they got my comics here.

801
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:38,190
What a depressing vacation

802
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:47,200
Goddamn

803
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:11,650
Checkmate, friend

804
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:30,540
Champ, can I come up? Sure

805
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:34,110
How you doing?

806
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,250
Pretty good

807
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:37,380
Some kind of weather we're having

808
00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:39,280
It's pretty rough

809
00:53:39,290 --> 00:53:43,090
But for what you have to do it's good

810
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:45,260
Toughen you up

811
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:46,620
I guess so

812
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:49,730
You'll have to do almost everything alone

813
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:53,360
but I'll be with you.Yeah, I know

814
00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:56,500
Apollo was like my son

815
00:53:56,610 --> 00:53:59,240
I raised him

816
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:00,970
When he died

817
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:03,810
part of me died

818
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:05,210
But now

819
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:07,010
you're the one

820
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:08,880
You're the one that's

821
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:11,350
going to keep his spirit alive.You're the one

822
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:15,430
that's going to make sure he didn't die for nothing

823
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:18,690
You'll have to go through hell

824
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:22,290
worse than any nightmare you ever dreamed

825
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,760
But in the end

826
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,340
I know you'll be the one standing

827
00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:31,240
I'll try

828
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:36,340
I'll try

829
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:43,360
You know what you have to do

830
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,650
Do it

831
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:49,460
Do it

832
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,000
Thanks, Duke

833
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:13,580
I couldn't stay away any more

834
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:18,960
I missed you

835
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,660
I missed you

836
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:27,560
I'm with you no matter what

837
00:59:27,570 --> 00:59:30,200
"No matter what"?

838
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:35,280
No matter what

839
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:23,080
No pain

840
01:01:23,090 --> 01:01:24,550
No pain

841
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:27,090
No pain

842
01:04:00,410 --> 01:04:03,480
Drago

843
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:10,020
Drago

844
01:04:12,930 --> 01:04:16,290
Hello, everybody, and Merry Christmas from a very unusual place

845
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:18,860
We're in Moscow in the Soviet Union

846
01:04:18,870 --> 01:04:20,720
I'm Barry Tompkins along with Al Bandiero

847
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:24,590
This promises to be the most-watched event in boxing history

848
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:28,470
The iron horse from America, Rocky Balboa

849
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:33,070
Drago

850
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:36,270
Since that tragedy in Las Vegas and the death of Apollo Creed

851
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:40,610
Drago has been nicknamed Death From Above.

852
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,380
The General Secretary of the Soviet

853
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:14,540
and other members of the Politburo

854
01:05:14,550 --> 01:05:20,890
have made their way to their seats high above the ring here in Moscow

855
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,120
I know you're busy just now

856
01:05:28,130 --> 01:05:29,760
but I want to tell you some things

857
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:30,960
I never told you

858
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:32,880
I know sometimes I act stupid

859
01:05:32,890 --> 01:05:34,730
and say stupid things

860
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:38,640
But you kept me around when others would have said, "Drop that bum."

861
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:39,800
You give me respect

862
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:42,110
It's hard for me to say these things

863
01:05:42,110 --> 01:05:44,270
because that ain't my way

864
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:47,680
but if I could just be someone else

865
01:05:47,690 --> 01:05:49,850
I'd want to be you

866
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:52,680
You're all heart, man.

867
01:05:54,290 --> 01:05:56,620
Thanks, Paulio

868
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:59,960
Now blast this guy's teeth out!

869
01:05:59,970 --> 01:06:02,430
I'll try

870
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:22,510
One of the fighters is starting to make his way toward the ring

871
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:23,680
Listen to this crowd!

872
01:06:23,690 --> 01:06:26,750
This borders on pure hatred.

873
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:29,620
Rocky's face absolutely like stone

874
01:06:29,630 --> 01:06:31,690
He is the picture of concentration.

875
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:35,360
The booing crowd here does not seem to bother him one bit

876
01:06:35,370 --> 01:06:38,060
The champ has a look tonight that can burn through lead

877
01:06:38,070 --> 01:06:41,830
The booing crowd has absolutely no effect on the man.

878
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:44,200
His concentration seems to be like stone

879
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:45,700
That's my dad

880
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:49,210
We know.We're not nerds.

881
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:52,680
Listen to this crowd. It sounds insane.

882
01:06:59,690 --> 01:07:03,450
Now the entrance of the Russian national champion

883
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:09,500
Ivan Drago, a man with an entire country in his corner.

884
01:08:00,790 --> 01:08:03,780
Look at the expression on the face of Ivan Drago

885
01:08:03,790 --> 01:08:07,150
He seems impervious to the madness of the crowd.

886
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:10,220
He's like a volcano just waiting to erupt

887
01:08:10,230 --> 01:08:16,060
The Russian champion is amazingly cool as he acknowledges his premier.

888
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:20,660
I'd like to point out again this is a non-sanctioned fight

889
01:08:20,670 --> 01:08:22,700
This is not for the title

890
01:08:22,710 --> 01:08:26,970
The American boxing commission has not sanctioned this bout

891
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:04,800
Ladies and gentlemen

892
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:18,810
It's unbelievable.

893
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:23,160
I've never seen such a hostile crowd.

894
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:51,920
It's an unbelievable sight to see.

895
01:10:52,890 --> 01:10:54,720
They're toe-to-toe.

896
01:10:54,730 --> 01:10:57,950
The Russian towers above the American It's a true case of

897
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:00,220
David and Goliath.

898
01:11:00,230 --> 01:11:03,660
The condition of both men is unbelievable

899
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:08,170
I must break you

900
01:11:13,650 --> 01:11:17,040
Remember what I said back there about wanting to be you?

901
01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:19,540
Forget it

902
01:11:20,420 --> 01:11:22,710
Thanks, Paulio

903
01:11:30,630 --> 01:11:32,890
Take it straight to him and be a rock for me. Understand?

904
01:11:34,630 --> 01:11:36,260
Be strong!

905
01:11:36,270 --> 01:11:37,660
All right? Take it to him.

906
01:11:37,670 --> 01:11:40,860
No pain.No pain

907
01:11:41,110 --> 01:11:43,000
Do it!

908
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,030
There's the opening round bell.

909
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:48,270
Rocky comes into the center of the ring

910
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:51,910
The Russian way back into Balboa's corner now

911
01:11:56,590 --> 01:11:59,780
Get out of there! Let's go!

912
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:06,220
Once more, it's Drago backing up Rocky with a jab.

913
01:12:06,230 --> 01:12:10,890
Balboa is not staying on balance

914
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:14,200
because of the Russian's long jab

915
01:12:14,210 --> 01:12:17,540
Brace yourself!

916
01:12:21,410 --> 01:12:23,640
Hands up!

917
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:26,340
Charge him! Now!

918
01:12:26,350 --> 01:12:29,710
He can't seem to touch the Russian!

919
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:32,280
Rocky pounding away at the midsection of the Russian!

920
01:12:32,290 --> 01:12:34,550
He hit him with everything he's got!

921
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:38,190
Drago just smiled at him.

922
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,960
Keep chopping away! Chop him down!

923
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,970
Come on, Rocky

924
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:50,870
Rocky Balboa is in serious trouble!

925
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:54,140
They might have to stop this one before somebody gets killed.

926
01:12:54,150 --> 01:12:58,550
Break his rhythm!

927
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:02,030
Rocky's hurt. He woke the sleeping giant.

928
01:13:02,030 --> 01:13:03,550
Now he's paying the price

929
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:07,850
A solid hand from Drago sends Rocky Balboa 15 feet across the ring!

930
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:10,990
And the champ is down!

931
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:18,130
Rocky, get up!

932
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:22,630
Hand up

933
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,900
Hand up

934
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:33,410
Drago continuing to punish Rocky Balboa!

935
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:35,110
Hejust will not let him out of that corner!

936
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:40,850
Rocky Balboa is just trying to get through this first round.

937
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:49,020
The Russian just threw Balboa into his own corner like a rag doll

938
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:52,390
A tough first three minutes for Rocky.

939
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:55,530
He's not only fighting what appears to be an invincible opponenthe's

940
01:13:55,530 --> 01:13:57,200
also fighting a very hostile crowd

941
01:13:57,210 --> 01:14:02,180
The Russian Premier and most of the Politburo are looking on

942
01:14:02,650 --> 01:14:04,010
What's happening out there?

943
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:06,410
He's winning

944
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:08,610
I see three of him out there

945
01:14:08,620 --> 01:14:09,880
Get the one in the middle.

946
01:14:09,890 --> 01:14:12,890
Right, hit the one in the middle.

947
01:14:20,370 --> 01:14:22,760
Take his heart. If you hurt him, you'll take his heart

948
01:14:22,770 --> 01:14:23,700
No pain.No pain.

949
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:24,800
Take his heart

950
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:27,570
Keep working!

951
01:14:27,940 --> 01:14:31,000
There's the bell for round two. It's been a one-sided fight so far

952
01:14:31,010 --> 01:14:34,940
It will take more than luck for Rocky to survive this round.

953
01:14:34,950 --> 01:14:36,140
Rocky's been hit with bombs.

954
01:14:36,140 --> 01:14:37,340
Slip and hook!

955
01:14:37,350 --> 01:14:40,880
Balboa trying to stay in the middle of the ring against the big Russian

956
01:14:40,890 --> 01:14:44,150
Move the head!

957
01:14:44,830 --> 01:14:48,730
Do you get to do. Stay with him!

958
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:52,230
No pain!

959
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:05,510
Rocky!

960
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:11,970
Balboa goes down again! Bounces right back up!

961
01:15:12,860 --> 01:15:15,150
He's getting killed!

962
01:15:18,590 --> 01:15:22,450
Rocky Balboa has taken Ivan Drago's best punches so far.

963
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:24,090
He's cut and bleeding,

964
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:28,570
but he's on his feet and on the run.

965
01:15:28,570 --> 01:15:31,700
He's cut!

966
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:34,900
He dead!

967
01:15:34,910 --> 01:15:37,200
The Russian's cut! It's a bad cut!

968
01:15:37,210 --> 01:15:41,800
Now it's Rocky Balboa coming after Ivan Drago!

969
01:15:51,930 --> 01:15:53,930
Incredible! Get him!

970
01:15:57,500 --> 01:15:59,190
The Russian wants to go on!

971
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:01,390
He grabs Balboa by the throat!

972
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:04,100
Balboa picks up the Russian

973
01:16:04,110 --> 01:16:05,540
and throws him to the ground like a wrestler!

974
01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:07,760
It's a gutter war!

975
01:16:07,770 --> 01:16:09,970
No holds barred in Moscow!

976
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:11,410
Rocky may be on the receiving end so far,

977
01:16:11,410 --> 01:16:13,570
but he's here to fight!

978
01:16:13,580 --> 01:16:15,550
This is shaping up to be a personal war.

979
01:16:15,550 --> 01:16:16,210
Right now,

980
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:20,450
it's anybody's boxing match

981
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:22,210
You're doing good.

982
01:16:22,220 --> 01:16:25,160
I couldn't do better myself

983
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:30,080
You got him hurt bad.Yeah

984
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:31,360
Now he's worried. You cut him!

985
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:33,360
You hurt him! You hurt him!

986
01:16:33,370 --> 01:16:34,920
You see? You see?

987
01:16:34,930 --> 01:16:37,200
He's not a machine! He's a man!

988
01:16:44,710 --> 01:16:46,210
You want it more than he does!

989
01:16:46,220 --> 01:16:49,280
No pain! No pain!

990
01:16:50,090 --> 01:16:53,850
Okay, Take it to him!

991
01:17:53,980 --> 01:17:56,910
A big right hand by Rocky Balboa!

992
01:18:24,250 --> 01:18:26,000
You're doing great.

993
01:18:26,010 --> 01:18:28,710
You've come a long way.

994
01:18:33,660 --> 01:18:35,920
Charge him! Now!

995
01:19:01,350 --> 01:19:03,280
Punch him!

996
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:33,870
Come on!

997
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:43,480
A few cheers now for Balboa

998
01:19:43,490 --> 01:19:47,030
Suddenly Moscow is pro Rocky!

999
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:01,330
No pain.

1000
01:20:02,390 --> 01:20:05,510
Keep taking it to him.

1001
01:20:25,770 --> 01:20:28,060
Al, this place is ready to explode

1002
01:20:28,070 --> 01:20:29,420
Lethal punch after punch!

1003
01:20:29,420 --> 01:20:30,830
Amazing willpower!

1004
01:20:30,830 --> 01:20:32,540
Neither man backing off

1005
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:34,170
Rocky Balboa's determination

1006
01:20:34,180 --> 01:20:37,800
is actually winning over the once-hostile crowd.

1007
01:20:37,810 --> 01:20:40,040
This is incredible

1008
01:20:40,050 --> 01:20:41,140
What round is it?

1009
01:20:41,150 --> 01:20:42,750
Fifteenth. One more round.

1010
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:44,690
There's no stopping us now.

1011
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:46,900
This is our round

1012
01:20:51,390 --> 01:20:52,090
No stopping now!

1013
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:54,160
You start, and you don't stop!

1014
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:55,700
All your strength!

1015
01:20:55,700 --> 01:20:56,990
All your power! All your love!

1016
01:20:56,990 --> 01:20:59,320
Everything you've got!

1017
01:21:28,060 --> 01:21:29,660
To win, you have to knock him out!

1018
01:21:29,670 --> 01:21:33,160
Punch till you can't punch no more!

1019
01:21:33,170 --> 01:21:35,390
This is your whole life here!

1020
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:37,360
Knock him out

1021
01:21:37,370 --> 01:21:39,560
Do it now!

1022
01:21:39,570 --> 01:21:41,930
There's the bell. The war is on.

1023
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:45,480
This is the last round.

1024
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:51,020
To the end

1025
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:54,240
Which one of these fighters

1026
01:21:54,250 --> 01:21:56,490
will be standing at the end of this round?

1027
01:21:56,490 --> 01:21:58,580
Drago snaps out a stiff jab

1028
01:21:58,590 --> 01:21:59,790
and another

1029
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:02,050
Go on

1030
01:22:02,060 --> 01:22:03,770
Rocky taking punishment,

1031
01:22:03,780 --> 01:22:05,420
trying to get inside!

1032
01:22:05,430 --> 01:22:08,370
He's completely exhausted

1033
01:22:08,740 --> 01:22:10,630
Come on, cut him

1034
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:13,600
What are you waiting for?

1035
01:22:19,180 --> 01:22:21,480
Hit him!

1036
01:22:26,820 --> 01:22:29,860
Come on, fight!

1037
01:22:46,540 --> 01:22:50,580
Balboa is chopping the Russian down!

1038
01:22:53,780 --> 01:22:59,320
Drago's hard right hand stuns Rocky Balboa

1039
01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:04,150
Don't go down!

1040
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:07,250
Don't go down.Go away.

1041
01:23:09,630 --> 01:23:11,640
Forget technique. Forget strategy.

1042
01:23:11,650 --> 01:23:13,630
This is just a street fight.

1043
01:23:13,630 --> 01:23:14,400
It's a question

1044
01:23:14,410 --> 01:23:15,630
of who wants it most.

1045
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:19,170
What is he doing? He's winning!

1046
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:25,740
To the body!

1047
01:23:25,750 --> 01:23:27,370
Come on!

1048
01:23:27,380 --> 01:23:29,310
Rocky

1049
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:31,040
knock his head off!

1050
01:23:31,050 --> 01:23:33,310
Rocky, knock his head off!

1051
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:36,360
Come on! Finish him!

1052
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:39,750
Don't stop

1053
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:43,130
Don't stop

1054
01:23:43,530 --> 01:23:45,620
You're gonna do it!

1055
01:23:59,580 --> 01:24:01,550
Four

1056
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:04,250
Six!

1057
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:12,480
Rocky Balboa has done the impossible

1058
01:24:12,490 --> 01:24:14,920
and these people love it!

1059
01:24:14,930 --> 01:24:18,590
It is absolute pandemonium!

1060
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:55,600
Thank you

1061
01:25:00,610 --> 01:25:02,970
I came here tonight

1062
01:25:02,980 --> 01:25:06,070
and I didn't know what to expect

1063
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:11,280
I've seen a lot of people hating me

1064
01:25:11,290 --> 01:25:15,580
and I didn't knowwhat to feel about that

1065
01:25:15,590 --> 01:25:21,020
so I guess I didn't like you much either

1066
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:28,290
During this fight

1067
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:31,000
I seen a lot of changing

1068
01:25:33,980 --> 01:25:37,670
the way you felt about me

1069
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:42,150
and the way I felt about you

1070
01:25:44,450 --> 01:25:49,080
In here, there were two guys

1071
01:25:49,090 --> 01:25:51,150
killing each other

1072
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:56,660
But I guess that's better than 20 million

1073
01:25:59,170 --> 01:26:02,670
What I'm trying to say is

1074
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:06,970
if I can change

1075
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:11,200
and you can change

1076
01:26:12,450 --> 01:26:15,540
everybody can change!

1077
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:37,130
I just want to say one thing to my kid

1078
01:26:37,140 --> 01:26:41,300
who should be home sleeping. Merry Christmas, kid!

1079
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:43,870
I love you!

1080
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:46,500
I love you!
