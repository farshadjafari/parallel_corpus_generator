1
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:47,541
How about a ride, mister?

2
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:49,459
Jennifer.

3
00:00:51,086 --> 00:00:53,672
Man, are you a sight for sore eyes.

4
00:00:54,714 --> 00:00:56,174
Let me look at you.

5
00:00:56,258 --> 00:00:59,469
Marty, you're acting like
you haven't seen me in a week.

6
00:01:00,095 --> 00:01:01,388
I haven't.

7
00:01:01,471 --> 00:01:03,848
Are you okay? Is everything all right?

8
00:01:08,979 --> 00:01:10,188
Yeah.

9
00:01:11,356 --> 00:01:12,816
Everything's great.

10
00:01:26,788 --> 00:01:28,123
Marty!

11
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:31,418
You've got to come back with me.

12
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:34,546
- Where?
- Back to the future.

13
00:01:38,717 --> 00:01:42,053
- Wait a minute. What are you doing, Doc?
- I need fuel.

14
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:47,017
Go ahead. Quick. Get in the car.

15
00:01:47,767 --> 00:01:50,478
No. Look, Doc, I just got here.
Jennifer's here.

16
00:01:50,562 --> 00:01:52,939
We're going to take
the new truck for a spin.

17
00:01:53,023 --> 00:01:55,775
Bring her along. This concerns her, too.

18
00:01:55,859 --> 00:01:59,654
Wait a minute. What are you talking about?
What happens to us in the future?

19
00:01:59,738 --> 00:02:02,115
Do we become assholes or something?

20
00:02:02,198 --> 00:02:04,784
No. You and Jennifer both turn out fine.

21
00:02:04,868 --> 00:02:08,371
It's your kids, Marty.
Something's got to be done about them.

22
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:18,381
Doc, you better back up.
We don't have enough road to get up to 88.

23
00:02:18,465 --> 00:02:23,011
Roads? Where we're going,
we don't need roads.

24
00:02:23,803 --> 00:02:25,180
Say, Marty!

25
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,350
Marty, I wanted to show
you these new matchbooks...

26
00:02:28,433 --> 00:02:31,019
...for my auto detailing I had printed up.

27
00:02:34,606 --> 00:02:36,441
A flying DeLorean?

28
00:02:48,912 --> 00:02:50,956
What the hell is going on here?

29
00:04:26,092 --> 00:04:28,303
- What the hell was that?
- Taxicab.

30
00:04:29,054 --> 00:04:32,224
- Taxicab? I thought we were flying.
- Precisely.

31
00:04:32,557 --> 00:04:34,351
All right, Doc. What's going on?

32
00:04:34,434 --> 00:04:36,436
Where are we? When are we?

33
00:04:36,728 --> 00:04:39,648
We're descending toward
Hill Valley, California...

34
00:04:40,315 --> 00:04:41,942
<i>...at 4:29 p.m...</i>

35
00:04:42,025 --> 00:04:45,445
<i>...on Wednesday, October 21, 2015.</i>

36
00:04:45,528 --> 00:04:47,155
2015?

37
00:04:48,365 --> 00:04:50,367
You mean we're in the future.

38
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:53,286
What do you mean?
How can we be in the future?

39
00:04:54,162 --> 00:04:55,580
Jennifer...

40
00:04:57,541 --> 00:05:00,210
...I don't know how to tell you this, but...

41
00:05:00,585 --> 00:05:02,504
...you're in a time machine.

42
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,676
- And this is the year 2015?
- October 21, 2015.

43
00:05:07,842 --> 00:05:10,053
God, so, like, you weren't kidding.

44
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,847
Marty, we can actually see our future.

45
00:05:13,098 --> 00:05:15,225
You said we were married, right?

46
00:05:15,308 --> 00:05:18,270
- Yeah...
- Yeah? Was it a big wedding?

47
00:05:18,353 --> 00:05:21,147
- We're going to see our wedding!
- Wow.

48
00:05:21,231 --> 00:05:23,900
- I'll see my wedding dress.
- Wow.

49
00:05:23,984 --> 00:05:27,612
I wonder where we live.
I bet it's a big house with lots of kids.

50
00:05:27,696 --> 00:05:29,072
How many kids--

51
00:05:29,155 --> 00:05:31,700
- Doc! What the hell are you doing?
- Relax.

52
00:05:31,992 --> 00:05:34,369
It's a sleep-inducing alpha rhythm generator.

53
00:05:34,452 --> 00:05:37,622
No one should know
too much about their future.

54
00:05:37,706 --> 00:05:40,458
<i>When she wakes up,</i>
<i>she'll think it was a dream.</i>

55
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,795
- What did you bring her for?
- I had to do something.

56
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:47,299
She saw the time machine.
I couldn't leave her with that information.

57
00:05:47,382 --> 00:05:50,010
Don't worry.
She's not essential to my plan.

58
00:05:50,594 --> 00:05:52,178
Well, you're the doc, Doc.

59
00:05:52,262 --> 00:05:53,930
Here's our exit.

60
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:24,878
You've got to get out
and change clothes.

61
00:06:24,961 --> 00:06:26,755
Right now? It's pouring rain.

62
00:06:30,008 --> 00:06:31,718
Wait five more seconds.

63
00:06:39,935 --> 00:06:41,478
Right on the tick.

64
00:06:41,686 --> 00:06:44,606
Amazing. Absolutely amazing.

65
00:06:45,148 --> 00:06:48,902
Too bad the post office
isn't as efficient as the weather service.

66
00:06:56,201 --> 00:06:59,704
Excuse the disguise, but I was afraid
you wouldn't recognize me.

67
00:06:59,788 --> 00:07:02,958
I went to a rejuvenation clinic
and got a whole natural overhaul.

68
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:06,586
<i>Took out some wrinkles,</i>
<i>did a hair repair, changed the blood...</i>

69
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:09,256
...added 30 or 40 years to my life.

70
00:07:09,673 --> 00:07:13,093
They also replaced my spleen and colon.
What do you think?

71
00:07:14,761 --> 00:07:16,429
You look great, Doc.

72
00:07:19,766 --> 00:07:21,268
The future.

73
00:07:22,018 --> 00:07:23,478
Unbelievable.

74
00:07:24,187 --> 00:07:26,898
- I got to check this out, Doc.
- All in good time.

75
00:07:26,982 --> 00:07:30,360
- We're on a tight schedule.
- Tell me about my future.

76
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,737
Do I become, like, a rich rock star?

77
00:07:32,821 --> 00:07:35,657
No one should know too much
about their destiny.

78
00:07:36,408 --> 00:07:39,995
- I am rich, though, right?
- Marty, please, take off your shirt.

79
00:07:41,413 --> 00:07:43,540
Put on the jacket and the shoes.

80
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,669
Got a mission to accomplish.

81
00:08:03,476 --> 00:08:05,145
Precisely on schedule.

82
00:08:10,442 --> 00:08:12,485
Power laces. All right.

83
00:08:32,589 --> 00:08:34,174
This thing doesn't fit.

84
00:08:34,257 --> 00:08:36,259
<i>Size-adjusting fit.</i>

85
00:08:36,343 --> 00:08:40,555
Pull out your pants pockets.
All kids here wear their pants inside out.

86
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:42,057
Put on this cap.

87
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,935
Perfect. You're the spitting image
of your future son.

88
00:08:45,018 --> 00:08:47,729
- What?
- Help me move Jennifer over here.

89
00:08:48,813 --> 00:08:51,274
- So what's the deal?
- Grab her feet.

90
00:08:52,943 --> 00:08:54,653
Okay, now what?

91
00:08:54,736 --> 00:08:58,657
In exactly two minutes,
you go around the corner into the Cafe '80s.

92
00:08:59,241 --> 00:09:00,325
Cafe '80s?

93
00:09:00,408 --> 00:09:03,328
It's one of those nostalgia places,
but not done well.

94
00:09:03,411 --> 00:09:05,956
Go in and order a Pepsi. Here's $50.

95
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,916
Wait for a guy named Griff.

96
00:09:07,999 --> 00:09:09,584
Right. Griff.

97
00:09:09,668 --> 00:09:12,671
Griff's going to ask about tonight.
Are you in or out?

98
00:09:12,754 --> 00:09:14,214
Tell him you are out.

99
00:09:14,297 --> 00:09:17,425
Whatever he says, say no, you're not interested.

100
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:20,595
Then leave,
come back here and wait for me.

101
00:09:21,596 --> 00:09:24,224
Don't talk to anyone.
Don't touch anything.

102
00:09:24,307 --> 00:09:26,726
Don't do anything.
Don't interact with anyone...

103
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,979
...and try not to look at anything.

104
00:09:29,062 --> 00:09:30,313
I don't get it.

105
00:09:30,397 --> 00:09:34,359
- You said this had to do with my kids.
- Look what happens to your son.

106
00:09:35,402 --> 00:09:36,695
My son?

107
00:09:38,363 --> 00:09:40,407
God, he looks just like me.

108
00:09:40,657 --> 00:09:44,119
"Within two hours of his arrest,
Martin McFly Jr...

109
00:09:44,494 --> 00:09:48,498
"...was tried, convicted, and sentenced
to 15 years in the state penitentiary"?

110
00:09:48,582 --> 00:09:49,958
Within two hours?

111
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:53,753
The justice system works swiftly
now that they've abolished lawyers.

112
00:09:53,837 --> 00:09:55,255
This is heavy.

113
00:09:55,338 --> 00:10:00,010
It gets worse. Your daughter tries
to break him out and gets sent up for 20 years.

114
00:10:00,385 --> 00:10:03,013
My daughter. I have a daughter?

115
00:10:03,221 --> 00:10:07,809
This one event starts a chain reaction
that completely destroys your entire family.

116
00:10:08,518 --> 00:10:11,313
Doc, this date...
This is tomorrow's newspaper.

117
00:10:11,396 --> 00:10:15,191
Precisely. I already went further ahead
into time to see what else happens.

118
00:10:15,275 --> 00:10:20,697
I backtracked everything to this one event.
We're here to prevent this event from happening.

119
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,199
Damn! I'm late!

120
00:10:22,782 --> 00:10:24,409
Where are you going now?

121
00:10:24,492 --> 00:10:27,829
To intercept the real Marty Jr.
You're taking his place.

122
00:10:27,996 --> 00:10:30,707
The Cafe '80s, guy named Griff, just say no!

123
00:10:30,832 --> 00:10:33,376
What about Jennifer?
We can't just leave her here.

124
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,296
She'll be safe.
It'll just be for a few minutes.

125
00:10:36,588 --> 00:10:41,509
Marty, be careful. That Griff has
a few short circuits in his bionic implants.

126
00:10:45,597 --> 00:10:46,848
The future.

00:14:39,998 --> 00:14:42,959
I just put the second coat on last week.

172
00:14:43,043 --> 00:14:45,503
- With your eyes closed?
- Are you two related?

173
00:14:45,587 --> 00:14:48,965
Hello? Hello? Anybody home?

174
00:14:49,049 --> 00:14:51,635
You think Griff called me
Grandpa for his health?

175
00:14:51,718 --> 00:14:53,720
- He's Griff?
- Gramps!

176
00:14:54,346 --> 00:14:56,473
What the hell am I paying you for?

177
00:14:56,556 --> 00:14:59,684
Kid, say hello to your grandma for me.

178
00:14:59,768 --> 00:15:03,230
- Get out of there, Gramps.
- Take it easy!

179
00:15:04,689 --> 00:15:07,525
And McFly, don't go anywhere!
You're next!

180
00:15:10,403 --> 00:15:12,447
This is a video game.

181
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,408
I got it working.

182
00:15:15,784 --> 00:15:17,827
My dad taught me about these.

183
00:15:18,453 --> 00:15:20,038
It is Wild Gunman.

184
00:15:20,372 --> 00:15:22,207
How do you play this thing?

185
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,959
I'll show you, kid.

186
00:15:24,876 --> 00:15:27,003
<i>I'm a crack shot at this.</i>

187
00:15:32,008 --> 00:15:34,386
You mean you have to use your hands?

188
00:15:34,511 --> 00:15:36,471
That's like a baby's toy.

189
00:15:38,557 --> 00:15:39,849
Baby's toy?

190
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,693
Pepsi Perfect.

191
00:15:49,776 --> 00:15:51,611
- Damn!
- Pepsi.

192
00:15:53,655 --> 00:15:54,990
McFly!

193
00:15:56,616 --> 00:15:59,578
I thought I told you to stay in here!

194
00:15:59,661 --> 00:16:02,664
Guys, how's it going?

195
00:16:03,373 --> 00:16:05,500
- McFly!
- Yeah?

196
00:16:06,001 --> 00:16:07,711
- McFly!
- What?

197
00:16:07,794 --> 00:16:09,629
Your shoe's unbelted.

198
00:16:14,217 --> 00:16:19,014
So, McFly, have you made a decision
about tonight's opportunity?

199
00:16:19,764 --> 00:16:24,311
Yeah, Griff. I was thinking about how
I'm not sure because it might be dangerous.

200
00:16:26,646 --> 00:16:28,315
What's wrong, McFly?

201
00:16:28,982 --> 00:16:30,984
You got no scrote?

202
00:16:36,573 --> 00:16:37,908
He's a complete wimp.

203
00:16:37,991 --> 00:16:42,037
What's it going to be, McFly?
Are you in or out?

204
00:16:42,204 --> 00:16:47,125
I just, I'm not sure that I should.
I should discuss it with my father.

205
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,960
Your father?

206
00:16:49,044 --> 00:16:51,296
Wrong answer, McFly! You lose!

207
00:16:54,549 --> 00:16:57,636
Okay, Griff, I'll do it.
Whatever you say.

208
00:16:57,719 --> 00:16:59,638
Stay down and shut up.

209
00:17:00,972 --> 00:17:02,807
Keep pedaling, you two!

210
00:17:13,652 --> 00:17:14,945
Now...

211
00:17:15,904 --> 00:17:17,948
...let's hear the right answer.

212
00:17:19,074 --> 00:17:20,408
Well!

213
00:17:20,825 --> 00:17:23,745
Since when did you become
the physical type?

214
00:17:23,828 --> 00:17:25,747
The answer's no, Griff.

215
00:17:26,164 --> 00:17:29,709
- No?
- What are you, deaf and stupid? I said no!

216
00:17:30,168 --> 00:17:32,504
What's wrong, McFly? Chicken?

217
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,220
What did you call me, Griff?

218
00:17:41,888 --> 00:17:44,099
Chicken, McFly!

219
00:17:44,349 --> 00:17:46,810
Nobody calls me...

220
00:17:49,521 --> 00:17:50,897
...chicken.

221
00:18:00,991 --> 00:18:03,243
- All right, punk!
- Look!

222
00:18:20,802 --> 00:18:22,721
Stop! Little girl, little girl.

223
00:18:22,804 --> 00:18:27,559
Stop. Look, I need to borrow your "hoverboard."

224
00:18:27,934 --> 00:18:30,061
- Where is he?
- Here.

225
00:18:31,104 --> 00:18:32,522
There!

226
00:18:38,737 --> 00:18:40,363
He's on a hoverboard.

227
00:18:42,824 --> 00:18:45,452
- Get the boards!
- Get McFly!

228
00:18:52,918 --> 00:18:54,669
Get him!

229
00:19:04,137 --> 00:19:05,513
Yeah, we got him!

230
00:19:15,815 --> 00:19:18,276
There's something very familiar about all this.

231
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,687
McFly, you bojo!

232
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:57,399
- Those boards don't work on water!
- Unless you've got power!

233
00:20:23,174 --> 00:20:24,426
Hook on!

234
00:20:33,685 --> 00:20:35,270
Batter up!

235
00:21:04,633 --> 00:21:06,134
Holy shit!

236
00:21:11,014 --> 00:21:12,515
Buttheads.

237
00:21:25,737 --> 00:21:27,489
<i>Drying mode on.</i>

238
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,783
<i>Jacket drying.</i>

239
00:21:31,868 --> 00:21:33,870
<i>Your jacket is now dry.</i>

240
00:21:37,415 --> 00:21:39,668
Hey, kid. Hey, little girl, thanks.

241
00:21:39,793 --> 00:21:42,462
Keep it. I got a Pit Bull now.

242
00:21:42,587 --> 00:21:44,839
- Come on.
- Save the clock tower!

243
00:21:45,006 --> 00:21:49,219
Throw in $100
and help save the clock tower.

244
00:21:49,427 --> 00:21:50,637
Sorry, no.

245
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,807
- That's an important historical landmark!
- Some other time.

246
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:56,601
Lightning struck that thing 60 years ago.

247
00:21:56,685 --> 00:21:59,813
Wait a minute.
Cubs win World Series...

248
00:22:01,606 --> 00:22:04,234
- Against Miami?
- Yeah, it's something, huh?

249
00:22:04,317 --> 00:22:06,736
Who would've thought? 100-1 shot!

250
00:22:06,862 --> 00:22:09,698
I wish I could go back
to the beginning of the season...

251
00:22:09,781 --> 00:22:12,325
- ...bet on the Cubs.
- I just meant Miami...

252
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,495
What did you just say?

253
00:22:15,579 --> 00:22:19,791
I wish I could go back to the beginning
of the season, bet on the Cubbies!

254
00:22:24,838 --> 00:22:27,883
This has an interesting feature.
It has a dust jacket.

255
00:22:27,966 --> 00:22:30,260
Books had these to protect the covers.

256
00:22:30,343 --> 00:22:32,762
That was before dust-repellent paper.

257
00:22:33,054 --> 00:22:37,434
If you're interested in dust,
we have something from the 1980s...

258
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:39,269
...called a Dustbuster.

259
00:22:43,398 --> 00:22:46,318
- I can't lose.
- Up here!

260
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:50,447
- Doc, what's going on?
- Stand by. I'll park over there.

261
00:22:50,947 --> 00:22:52,449
Yeah, all right.

262
00:22:54,534 --> 00:22:56,203
Hey, right on time.

263
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,246
Flying DeLorean?

264
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:00,874
I haven't seen one in 30 years.

265
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:03,877
Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.

266
00:23:04,669 --> 00:23:07,130
I'm walking here!
I'm walking here!

267
00:23:08,673 --> 00:23:13,094
- What the hell?
- Don't drive trank, low-res scuzzball!

268
00:23:13,887 --> 00:23:15,430
Two of them?

269
00:23:15,555 --> 00:23:17,933
I left him in
a suspended animation kennel.

270
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:20,143
Einstein never knew I was gone!

271
00:23:20,602 --> 00:23:21,853
Marty!

272
00:23:21,937 --> 00:23:25,482
What in the name
of Sir Isaac H. Newton happened here?

273
00:23:25,565 --> 00:23:28,693
Doc, my kid showed up.
All hell broke loose.

274
00:23:28,777 --> 00:23:30,195
Your kid?

275
00:23:30,278 --> 00:23:33,657
Great Scott, I was afraid of this.

276
00:23:33,823 --> 00:23:38,703
I used it on Jennifer. There wasn't enough
power left to knock your son out for a full hour.

277
00:23:38,787 --> 00:23:41,122
Doc, Doc, look at this!

278
00:23:41,206 --> 00:23:42,666
It's changing.

279
00:23:54,844 --> 00:23:57,305
<i>I was framed!</i>

280
00:23:57,806 --> 00:24:00,850
Yes! Yes, of course!

281
00:24:01,851 --> 00:24:05,981
Because this hoverboard incident
occurred, Griff goes to jail.

282
00:24:06,231 --> 00:24:10,360
Your son won't go with him tonight.
That robbery won't take place!

283
00:24:10,443 --> 00:24:15,031
History, future history,
has been altered, and this is proof!

284
00:24:15,115 --> 00:24:19,870
We've succeeded, not as planned,
but no matter. Let's get Jennifer and go home!

285
00:24:22,163 --> 00:24:23,790
Hi, Einie. Hi, buddy.

286
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:27,961
- What's this?
- A souvenir.

287
00:24:28,044 --> 00:24:30,422
50 years of sports statistics."

288
00:24:30,505 --> 00:24:32,632
Hardly recreational reading material.

289
00:24:32,716 --> 00:24:36,094
Doc, what's the harm
in bringing back some info on the future?

290
00:24:36,177 --> 00:24:38,096
We could place some bets.

291
00:24:39,014 --> 00:24:42,142
I didn't invent the time machine
for financial gain!

292
00:24:42,225 --> 00:24:45,145
The intent is to gain
a clearer perception of humanity.

293
00:24:45,228 --> 00:24:48,398
Our past, our future,
the pitfalls, the possibilities...

294
00:24:48,481 --> 00:24:53,153
...the perils, and the promise. Perhaps an answer
to that universal question, "Why?"

295
00:24:53,403 --> 00:24:55,530
I'm all for that.

296
00:24:55,697 --> 00:24:58,241
What's wrong with making
a few bucks on the side?

297
00:24:58,325 --> 00:25:01,828
I am going to put this in the trash.

298
00:25:03,496 --> 00:25:04,915
Great Scott!

299
00:25:08,418 --> 00:25:12,547
McFly, Jennifer Jane Parker,
3793 Oakhurst Street...

300
00:25:12,756 --> 00:25:14,341
...Hilldale, age 47.

301
00:25:14,424 --> 00:25:17,344
47? That's a hell
of a good face-lift!

302
00:25:17,427 --> 00:25:20,805
- What's happening?
- They used her thumbprint to assess her ID.

303
00:25:20,889 --> 00:25:24,517
Since thumbprints never change,
they assume she's the future Jennifer.

304
00:25:24,601 --> 00:25:25,810
We got to stop them.

305
00:25:25,894 --> 00:25:29,022
How? Tell them we're time travelers?
They'd have us committed.

306
00:25:29,105 --> 00:25:31,274
She's clean. We take her home.

307
00:25:31,358 --> 00:25:32,943
To Hilldale?

308
00:25:33,026 --> 00:25:35,278
<i>We won't get there before dark.</i>

309
00:25:35,362 --> 00:25:37,781
They're taking her to your future home!

310
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,660
We'll arrive shortly thereafter,
get her, and return to 1985.

311
00:25:41,743 --> 00:25:44,704
I'll see where I live.
See myself as an old man?

312
00:25:44,788 --> 00:25:47,874
No, that could result in... Great Scott!

313
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:50,919
Jennifer could conceivably encounter
her future self!

314
00:25:51,002 --> 00:25:53,380
The consequences could be disastrous!

315
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:56,883
- What do you mean?
- I foresee two possibilities.

316
00:25:56,967 --> 00:26:01,638
One, seeing herself 30 years older would
put her into shock, and she'd pass out...

317
00:26:01,721 --> 00:26:04,432
...or two, the encounter
could create a time paradox...

318
00:26:04,516 --> 00:26:07,561
...and cause a chain reaction that would unravel...

319
00:26:07,644 --> 00:26:11,231
...the space-time continuum
and destroy the entire universe!

320
00:26:11,356 --> 00:26:13,400
Granted, that's a worst-case scenario.

321
00:26:13,483 --> 00:26:17,237
The destruction might be localized,
limited to our own galaxy.

322
00:26:17,988 --> 00:26:19,614
Well, that's a relief.

323
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:27,330
Let's go and find Jennifer
before she finds herself.

324
00:26:29,082 --> 00:26:32,168
The skyway's jammed.
It'll take forever to get there.

325
00:26:32,335 --> 00:26:33,712
And this stays here!

326
00:26:33,795 --> 00:26:38,633
I didn't invent the time machine to win
at gambling, but to travel through time!

327
00:26:38,717 --> 00:26:40,218
I know.

328
00:26:49,686 --> 00:26:54,149
So, Doc Brown invented a time machine.

329
00:27:20,467 --> 00:27:21,968
Hilldale.

330
00:27:22,969 --> 00:27:26,848
Nothing but a breeding ground
for tranks, lobos, and zipheads.

331
00:27:26,932 --> 00:27:29,809
Yeah, they ought to tear
this whole place down.

332
00:27:31,478 --> 00:27:33,480
<i>Welcome home, Jennifer.</i>

333
00:27:35,732 --> 00:27:38,485
You got a little tranked,
but I think you can walk.

334
00:27:38,568 --> 00:27:42,072
Ma'am, you should reprogram.
It's dangerous in the dark.

335
00:27:42,155 --> 00:27:44,574
- Lights on?
- Yes. Now, look.

336
00:27:45,408 --> 00:27:47,911
Just take it easy, and you'll be fine.

337
00:27:48,161 --> 00:27:50,080
<i>And be careful in the future.</i>

338
00:27:50,956 --> 00:27:52,457
The future?

339
00:27:53,667 --> 00:27:55,710
Have a nice day, Mrs. McFly.

340
00:27:58,296 --> 00:28:01,675
<i>Broadcasting beautiful views</i>
<i>24 hours a day.</i>

341
00:28:02,008 --> 00:28:04,386
<i>You're tuned to the Scenery Channel.</i>

342
00:28:09,349 --> 00:28:11,560
I'm in the future.

343
00:28:23,697 --> 00:28:26,533
I get married in the Chapel O Love?

344
00:28:26,658 --> 00:28:29,077
Mom? Mom, is that you?

345
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,246
I got to get out of here!

346
00:28:35,834 --> 00:28:37,127
Mom!

347
00:28:45,886 --> 00:28:48,346
Mom? Mom, is that you?

348
00:28:53,268 --> 00:28:55,186
- Grandma!
- Sweetheart!

349
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,438
Hi!

350
00:28:56,521 --> 00:28:59,691
- What happened to Grandpa?
- He threw his back out again.

351
00:28:59,774 --> 00:29:02,819
- How's Granddad's little pumpkin?
- How did you do that?

352
00:29:02,903 --> 00:29:04,738
Out on the golf course.

353
00:29:05,405 --> 00:29:08,074
Are your folks home yet?
I brought pizza!

354
00:29:08,366 --> 00:29:10,702
- Who's going to eat all that?
- I will.

355
00:29:10,952 --> 00:29:12,495
Damn this traffic!

356
00:29:12,579 --> 00:29:16,416
Jennifer, old Jennifer gets home around now.
I hope we're not too late.

357
00:29:20,128 --> 00:29:23,965
- What is it? What's the matter, Doc?
- I thought I saw a taxi.

358
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:26,092
I thought it was following us.

359
00:29:26,801 --> 00:29:29,554
I can't believe
this window's still broken.

360
00:29:29,638 --> 00:29:32,349
When the repairman
called Daddy a chicken...

361
00:29:32,432 --> 00:29:35,894
<i>...Daddy threw him out of the house.</i>
<i>Now nobody will fix it.</i>

362
00:29:36,228 --> 00:29:38,939
Look how worn out this is.

363
00:29:40,065 --> 00:29:44,152
Your father's biggest problem
is that he loses all self-control...

364
00:29:44,277 --> 00:29:46,196
<i>...when someone calls him chicken.</i>

365
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:48,156
<i>How often have we heard it?</i>

366
00:29:48,448 --> 00:29:51,326
Mom, I can't let him think I'm chicken."

367
00:29:51,618 --> 00:29:53,870
You're right. Well, you're right!

368
00:29:53,995 --> 00:29:57,749
About 30 years ago, your father
tried to prove he wasn't chicken.

369
00:29:57,832 --> 00:30:00,043
He ended up in an automobile accident.

370
00:30:00,126 --> 00:30:01,628
With the Rolls-Royce?

371
00:30:01,711 --> 00:30:03,380
Automobile accident.

372
00:30:15,392 --> 00:30:18,103
All right, Einie, let's find Jennifer.

373
00:30:18,937 --> 00:30:22,065
I live in Hilldale? This is great!

374
00:30:22,148 --> 00:30:25,193
Stay here, change clothes.
If I need you, I'll holler.

375
00:30:25,277 --> 00:30:26,903
I want to check out my house.

376
00:30:26,987 --> 00:30:30,615
We can't risk you running
into your older self. Einie, let's go.

377
00:30:33,451 --> 00:30:34,661
Hilldale.

378
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,706
This is bitchin'.

379
00:30:43,295 --> 00:30:45,964
<i>One, seven, four point five zero.</i>

380
00:30:46,089 --> 00:30:48,717
- That will be $174.50.
- Here.

381
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,552
Be careful in this neighborhood.

382
00:30:50,635 --> 00:30:52,971
- Where's my receipt?
- Right here.

383
00:30:53,054 --> 00:30:54,514
How about a tip?

384
00:31:09,571 --> 00:31:13,533
That accident caused a chain reaction,
sending Marty's life down the tubes.

385
00:31:13,617 --> 00:31:17,329
Otherwise, your father's life
would have turned out differently.

386
00:31:17,412 --> 00:31:19,497
<i>The man wouldn't have pressed charges...</i>

387
00:31:19,581 --> 00:31:22,751
...Marty wouldn't have broken his hand,
given up on his music...

388
00:31:22,834 --> 00:31:25,462
<i>...and spent years feeling sorry for himself.</i>

389
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:27,255
Hey, Mom, nice pants.

390
00:31:27,339 --> 00:31:29,925
The reason
your mother married him--

391
00:31:30,133 --> 00:31:31,259
Mom?

392
00:31:34,095 --> 00:31:35,680
Turn off.

393
00:31:36,056 --> 00:31:41,311
I want channels 18, 24, 63,
109, 87, and the Weather Channel.

394
00:31:41,394 --> 00:31:45,023
<i>Bringing you</i>
<i>the world's weather 24 hours a day.</i>

395
00:31:45,649 --> 00:31:47,943
<i>Weather conditions remain the same--</i>

396
00:31:48,151 --> 00:31:50,153
<i>Board-certified implant surgeons...</i>

397
00:31:50,237 --> 00:31:52,697
<i>Welcome home, Marty.</i>

398
00:31:52,781 --> 00:31:53,990
Dad's home.

399
00:31:54,199 --> 00:31:56,701
That's right.
He's home. Dad's home.

400
00:31:56,868 --> 00:31:58,995
- <i>Lord of the manor.</i>
- Hello.

401
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:01,122
- <i>King of the castle.</i>
- Hello.

402
00:32:02,666 --> 00:32:04,626
What the hell is this?

403
00:32:04,751 --> 00:32:06,753
<i>Lithium mode on.</i>

404
00:32:06,836 --> 00:32:08,338
Yeah. That's better.

405
00:32:08,421 --> 00:32:10,215
Damned kids.

406
00:32:10,882 --> 00:32:11,883
Hey, Son.

407
00:32:13,218 --> 00:32:15,178
Watching a little TV for a change?

408
00:32:28,066 --> 00:32:29,484
Son of a...

409
00:33:09,608 --> 00:33:12,569
- I'm hungry.
- Just wait your turn.

410
00:33:12,736 --> 00:33:15,030
When it's ready,
shove it in my mouth.

411
00:33:15,113 --> 00:33:17,032
Don't you be a smart-ass.

412
00:33:17,741 --> 00:33:19,576
Hey! The Atrocity Channel.

413
00:33:19,659 --> 00:33:21,745
Hydrate level 4, please.

414
00:33:28,752 --> 00:33:30,212
Is it ready?

415
00:33:30,295 --> 00:33:31,588
Here you go.

416
00:33:31,671 --> 00:33:34,841
Mom, you sure can
hydrate a pizza.

417
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:38,136
I'm sorry.
I missed that whole thing.

418
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,639
I'm just worried about Jennifer.

419
00:33:40,722 --> 00:33:45,518
- Why isn't she home?
- I'm not sure where Jennifer is, Mom.

420
00:33:45,727 --> 00:33:47,979
She should have been home hours ago.

421
00:33:48,188 --> 00:33:50,565
- I can't keep track--
- Fruit!

422
00:33:51,525 --> 00:33:54,361
- Fruit, please.
- She's in one of those moods.

423
00:33:54,444 --> 00:33:56,613
Aren't you and her
getting along?

424
00:33:56,696 --> 00:34:00,367
Yeah. Great, Mom.
We're like a couple of teenagers.

425
00:34:02,327 --> 00:34:04,329
Dad, telephone. It's Needles.

426
00:34:04,871 --> 00:34:06,498
Dad, it's for you.

427
00:34:07,374 --> 00:34:10,210
All right. Well, I'll take that in the den.

428
00:34:10,377 --> 00:34:11,795
Retract.

429
00:34:12,379 --> 00:34:14,047
Hello. In here, please.

430
00:34:16,091 --> 00:34:18,510
<i>Hey, the big M.</i>

431
00:34:18,635 --> 00:34:20,554
<i>How's it hanging, McFly?</i>

432
00:34:21,137 --> 00:34:22,305
Hey, Needles.

433
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:23,598
Needles?

434
00:34:23,682 --> 00:34:26,059
<i>Did you look</i>
<i>at my little business proposal?</i>

435
00:34:26,142 --> 00:34:28,854
- I don't know.
- <i>Why are you worried?</i>

436
00:34:28,937 --> 00:34:32,232
<i>If this works,</i>
<i>your financial problems are solved.</i>

437
00:34:32,566 --> 00:34:35,735
And if it doesn't work, Needles,
I could get fired.

438
00:34:35,819 --> 00:34:39,406
It's illegal.
I mean, what if the Jits is monitoring?

439
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:43,034
- <i>The Jits will never find out.</i>
- God.

440
00:34:43,118 --> 00:34:47,664
<i>Come on. Stick your card in the slot,</i>
<i>and I'll handle it.</i>

441
00:34:48,373 --> 00:34:52,961
<i>Unless you want everyone</i>
<i>in the division to think you're chicken.</i>

442
00:34:57,007 --> 00:35:00,260
Nobody calls me chicken, Needles.

443
00:35:00,343 --> 00:35:02,554
- Nobody!
- <i>All right.</i>

444
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,265
<i>Prove it.</i>

445
00:35:09,186 --> 00:35:10,604
All right.

446
00:35:11,313 --> 00:35:13,148
All right, Needles.

447
00:35:16,359 --> 00:35:17,777
Here's my card.

448
00:35:18,153 --> 00:35:20,071
<i>Scan it. I'm in.</i>

449
00:35:20,197 --> 00:35:23,783
<i>Thanks, McFly.</i>
<i>I'll see you at the plant tomorrow.</i>

450
00:35:26,244 --> 00:35:27,204
Shit.

451
00:35:29,289 --> 00:35:30,957
<i>McFly!</i>

452
00:35:31,666 --> 00:35:33,960
Fujitsu-san.

453
00:35:34,127 --> 00:35:35,462
<i>McFly...</i>

454
00:35:35,879 --> 00:35:39,007
<i>...I was monitoring that</i>
<i>scan you just interfaced.</i>

455
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:40,425
<i>You are terminated!</i>

456
00:35:40,508 --> 00:35:43,678
Terminated. No! It wasn't my fault, sir.

457
00:35:43,762 --> 00:35:46,890
- Needles was behind it.
- <i>And you cooperated.</i>

458
00:35:46,973 --> 00:35:50,268
It was a sting operation.
I was setting him up.

459
00:35:50,352 --> 00:35:52,229
<i>Read my fax!</i>

460
00:35:52,312 --> 00:35:54,731
No! Please! I cannot be fired.

461
00:35:54,898 --> 00:35:56,233
<i>I'm fired.</i>

462
00:36:07,536 --> 00:36:09,579
This is heavy.

463
00:36:10,705 --> 00:36:12,916
<i>What am I going to tell Jennifer?</i>

464
00:36:12,999 --> 00:36:14,668
Jennifer. Jennifer.

465
00:36:15,043 --> 00:36:17,295
Doc. Am I glad to see you.

466
00:36:18,088 --> 00:36:20,882
Go out the front door. I'll meet you there.

467
00:36:21,049 --> 00:36:23,552
But it doesn't open. There's no doorknob.

468
00:36:23,635 --> 00:36:25,929
Press your thumb to the plate.

469
00:36:26,012 --> 00:36:27,722
What plate?

470
00:36:41,903 --> 00:36:43,780
What does this fax mean?

471
00:36:43,864 --> 00:36:47,617
Mom. It's a joke,
an office joke. It's a joke fax.

472
00:36:47,701 --> 00:36:51,246
- I heard you yell.
- Calm down. I wasn't yelling.

473
00:36:51,329 --> 00:36:53,123
Needles and I were just joking.

474
00:36:53,206 --> 00:36:55,041
<i>Welcome home, Jennifer.</i>

475
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:57,711
Lost my job, Mom?
Get out of town.

476
00:37:02,465 --> 00:37:04,509
- I'm young!
- I'm old!

477
00:37:13,768 --> 00:37:15,312
Marty! Marty!

478
00:37:15,395 --> 00:37:17,814
<i>Marty, come quick! Quick!</i>

479
00:37:33,496 --> 00:37:37,083
She encountered her older self
and went into shock.

480
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:38,585
<i>She'll be fine.</i>

481
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:40,795
<i>Let's get her back to 1985.</i>

482
00:37:40,962 --> 00:37:43,506
Then I'll destroy the time machine.

483
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,925
Destroy it?

484
00:37:45,008 --> 00:37:48,345
<i>What about that stuff</i>
<i>about humanity and where we're going?</i>

485
00:37:48,428 --> 00:37:51,014
The risks are too great,
as this incident proves.

486
00:37:51,097 --> 00:37:52,933
And I was behaving responsibly.

487
00:37:53,016 --> 00:37:56,269
Imagine if the time machine
fell into the wrong hands?

488
00:37:59,147 --> 00:38:00,273
My only regret...

489
00:38:00,357 --> 00:38:04,236
<i>...is that I'll never get a chance</i>
<i>to visit my favorite historical era...</i>

490
00:38:04,444 --> 00:38:05,862
<i>...the Old West.</i>

491
00:38:06,029 --> 00:38:09,115
But time traveling is just too dangerous.

492
00:38:10,033 --> 00:38:12,786
Better that I devote myself to study...

493
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:16,206
...the other great mystery of the universe:

494
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:19,417
Women.

495
00:38:21,336 --> 00:38:24,881
Marty, Einie, brace yourselves
for temporal displacement.

496
00:38:35,392 --> 00:38:36,893
Did we make it?

497
00:38:40,939 --> 00:38:42,482
Are we back?

498
00:38:49,197 --> 00:38:50,282
We're back.

499
00:39:11,094 --> 00:39:15,390
Let's put her in the swing.
You can return in your truck and wake her.

500
00:39:15,932 --> 00:39:18,393
When she awakens here
in her own house...

501
00:39:18,476 --> 00:39:21,313
...you can convince her it was a dream.

502
00:39:21,396 --> 00:39:23,273
We're just leaving her here?

503
00:39:24,149 --> 00:39:27,235
Disorientation will help convince her
it was a dream.

504
00:39:27,485 --> 00:39:29,362
How long will she be out?

505
00:39:29,446 --> 00:39:31,907
I'm not quite sure.
She received quite a shock.

506
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:35,202
<i>Could be a few minutes,</i>
<i>probably a couple of hours.</i>

507
00:39:35,785 --> 00:39:38,872
- You better bring smelling salts.
- You're the doc, Doc.

508
00:39:38,955 --> 00:39:40,790
Come on. Let's go, Einie.

509
00:39:42,792 --> 00:39:44,794
Don't worry. She'll be fine.

510
00:39:46,087 --> 00:39:48,673
I don't remember bars
being on these windows.

511
00:40:05,315 --> 00:40:08,401
If you need me,
I'll be in my lab dismantling this thing.

512
00:40:08,485 --> 00:40:09,653
Right.

513
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:28,588
What the hell?

514
00:40:47,315 --> 00:40:50,235
Wait a minute.
What are you doing in my room?

515
00:40:50,318 --> 00:40:52,904
- Rape! Mom!
- Okay. Okay.

516
00:40:52,988 --> 00:40:55,615
- Dad, help!
- Freeze, sucker!

517
00:40:55,699 --> 00:40:59,286
- I don't want any trouble.
- You got trouble now, you piece of trash.

518
00:41:00,495 --> 00:41:03,707
- What are you doing here?
- I'm in the wrong house.

519
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:05,917
You got that right, you son of a...

520
00:41:06,334 --> 00:41:09,588
- Look. I made a mistake.
- Damned right you made a mistake!

521
00:41:10,422 --> 00:41:13,300
I'm going to tear your ass up!

522
00:41:13,425 --> 00:41:18,346
That's right. You keep running, sucker!
Tell that realty company that I ain't selling!

523
00:41:18,722 --> 00:41:20,307
We won't be terrorized!

524
00:42:03,016 --> 00:42:04,809
This has got to be the wrong year.

525
00:42:23,203 --> 00:42:24,746
1985?

526
00:42:26,581 --> 00:42:28,500
- It can't be.
- Drop it.

527
00:42:32,087 --> 00:42:35,131
So you're the son of a bitch
who's been stealing my papers.

528
00:42:35,215 --> 00:42:36,508
Mr. Strickland.

529
00:42:36,841 --> 00:42:40,929
- Mr. Strickland. It's me, sir. Marty.
- Who?

530
00:42:41,012 --> 00:42:43,306
Martin McFly.
Don't you know me from school?

531
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:46,685
I've never seen you before in my life,
but you look like a slacker.

532
00:42:46,768 --> 00:42:48,937
Yeah, that's right. I am a slacker.

533
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:53,859
- You gave me detention last week.
- The school burned down six years ago.

534
00:42:53,942 --> 00:42:57,279
You have three seconds to get off my porch
with your nuts intact.

535
00:42:57,362 --> 00:43:00,448
- One.
- I just want to know what's going on.

536
00:43:00,532 --> 00:43:01,449
Two.

537
00:43:03,034 --> 00:43:04,202
Strickland!

538
00:43:04,411 --> 00:43:05,495
Yeah!

539
00:43:22,429 --> 00:43:24,180
Eat lead, slackers!

540
00:43:31,062 --> 00:43:35,317
Watch where you're going,
crazy drunk pedestrian.

541
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:36,693
Red.

542
00:44:33,333 --> 00:44:37,379
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>welcome to the Biff Tannen Museum.</i>

<i>but who is the man?</i>

00:44:49,641 --> 00:44:54,688
<i>Inside you'll learn how Biff</i>
<i>became one of the richest men in America.</i>

548

550
00:45:01,111 --> 00:45:02,779

00:45:02,863 --> 00:45:06,449
<i>See Biff's humble beginnings</i>
<i>and how a trip to the racetrack...</i>

552
00:45:06,533 --> 00:45:10,161

00:45:20,005 --> 00:45:22,757
<i>Learn how Biff parlayed</i>
<i>that lucky winning streak...</i>

556
00:45:22,841 --> 00:45:24,926

00:45:27,012 --> 00:45:29,764
<i>...Biff successfully lobbied</i>

559

561
00:45:34,895 --> 00:45:38,690
<i>I just want to say one thing:</i>
<i>God bless America!</i>

562
00:45:39,482 --> 00:45:41,902
<i>Meet the women</i>
<i>who shared his passion...</i>

563
00:45:41,985 --> 00:45:43,862

00:45:44,321 --> 00:45:46,323

00:45:46,406 --> 00:45:49,659

566
00:45:49,743 --> 00:45:54,206

<i>Lorraine Baines McFly.</i>

567
00:45:54,289 --> 00:45:55,749
<i>Third time's the charm.</i>

568
00:45:58,376 --> 00:45:59,711
No!

569
00:46:02,088 --> 00:46:04,382
- No!
- Come with us upstairs.

570
00:46:04,466 --> 00:46:07,761
- Let me go.
- We can do this the easy way or the hard way.

571
00:46:08,595 --> 00:46:10,388
<i>The easy way.</i>

572
00:46:20,815 --> 00:46:25,529
- Mom? Mom, is that you?
- Just relax, Marty.

573
00:46:26,488 --> 00:46:28,782
You've been asleep
for almost two hours.

574
00:46:32,452 --> 00:46:35,038
I had a horrible nightmare. It was terrible.

575
00:46:35,956 --> 00:46:41,127
Well, you're safe and sound now,
back on the good old 27th floor.

576
00:46:41,586 --> 00:46:43,255
27th floor!

577
00:46:49,052 --> 00:46:52,222
Mom? Mom, that can't be you.

578
00:46:52,597 --> 00:46:55,559
Well, yes, it's me, Marty. Are you all right?

579
00:46:55,976 --> 00:46:59,521
I'm fine. I'm fine.
It's just that you're so... You're so...

580
00:47:00,856 --> 00:47:01,773
...big.

581
00:47:02,274 --> 00:47:04,943
Everything's going to be fine, Marty.
Are you hungry?

582
00:47:05,026 --> 00:47:06,945
I can call room service.

583
00:47:08,697 --> 00:47:10,031
Room service?

584
00:47:10,115 --> 00:47:13,827
- <i>Lorraine!</i>
- Oh, my God. It's your father.

585
00:47:14,035 --> 00:47:15,120
My father?

586
00:47:16,788 --> 00:47:19,624
You're supposed to be in Switzerland,
you son of a bitch!

587
00:47:19,749 --> 00:47:20,750
My father!

588
00:47:20,834 --> 00:47:23,295
You got kicked out of another boarding school?

589
00:47:24,129 --> 00:47:27,424
Do you know how much dough
I've blown on your no-good kids?

590
00:47:28,508 --> 00:47:31,428
What the hell do you care? We can afford it.

591
00:47:31,761 --> 00:47:35,724
The least we can do with that money
is provide a better life for our children.

592
00:47:36,349 --> 00:47:38,435
Hold on. Let's get this straight.

593
00:47:38,518 --> 00:47:40,478
Marty is your kid, not mine.

594
00:47:40,562 --> 00:47:43,648
All the world's money
wouldn't help that lazy bum.

595
00:47:43,732 --> 00:47:45,525
Stop it, Biff. Just stop it.

596
00:47:45,901 --> 00:47:47,152
Look at him.

597
00:47:47,319 --> 00:47:49,821
He's a butthead, just like his old man was.

598
00:47:52,115 --> 00:47:56,203
Don't you dare speak
that way about George.

599
00:47:57,495 --> 00:47:59,831
You're not even half the man he was.

600
00:48:01,833 --> 00:48:03,752
You son of a bitch!

601
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:10,175
Always the little hothead?

602
00:48:16,848 --> 00:48:18,767
<i>You want to take a poke at me?</i>

603
00:48:22,187 --> 00:48:25,565
Damn it, Biff.
That's it. I'm leaving.

604
00:48:26,233 --> 00:48:28,985
So go ahead. Think about this, Lorraine!

605
00:48:29,069 --> 00:48:32,906
Who's going to pay for your clothes?
And your jewelry and liquor?

606
00:48:32,989 --> 00:48:35,659
Who's going to pay for your cosmetic surgery?

607
00:48:36,076 --> 00:48:39,538
You were the one
who wanted me to get these things.

608
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,457
If you want them back, you can have them.

609
00:48:42,916 --> 00:48:44,125
Look, Lorraine.

610
00:48:44,209 --> 00:48:48,421
You leave and I won't only cut off you,
I'll cut off your kids.

611
00:48:49,256 --> 00:48:51,383
- You wouldn't.
- Wouldn't I?

612
00:48:51,466 --> 00:48:54,678
First your daughter Linda.
I'll cancel all her credit cards.

613
00:48:54,886 --> 00:48:57,305
She'll settle her debts with the bank herself.

614
00:48:57,389 --> 00:49:00,308
I'll have your idiot son Dave's probation revoked.

615
00:49:00,392 --> 00:49:01,768
And as for Marty...

616
00:49:02,561 --> 00:49:05,564
...maybe you'd like to have
all of your kids behind bars...

617
00:49:05,647 --> 00:49:07,190
...just like your brother Joey.

618
00:49:07,816 --> 00:49:10,026
One big happy jailbird family.

619
00:49:13,071 --> 00:49:16,658
All right, Biff. You win. I'll stay.

620
00:49:20,328 --> 00:49:24,332
As for you, I'll be back up here
in an hour, so you better not be.

621
00:49:35,797 --> 00:49:38,382
He was right, and I was wrong.

622
00:49:40,802 --> 00:49:41,844
Mom!

623
00:49:42,595 --> 00:49:45,473
Mom, what're you saying?
You're actually defending him.

624
00:49:45,556 --> 00:49:46,974
I had it coming.

625
00:49:47,308 --> 00:49:50,144
He's my husband,
and he takes care of all of us...

626
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,481
- ...and he deserves our respect.
- Respect?

627
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:58,194
Your husband!
How could he be your husband?

628
00:49:58,778 --> 00:50:02,073
- How could you leave Dad for him?
- Leave Dad?

629
00:50:02,156 --> 00:50:06,702
- Marty, are you feeling all right?
- No, I'm not feeling all right!

630
00:50:06,786 --> 00:50:09,497
I don't understand what's going on here.

631
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:12,208
Why nobody can give me a simple,
straight answer.

632
00:50:12,291 --> 00:50:15,503
They must have hit you over the head
hard this time.

633
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:18,005
Mom, I just want to know one thing.

634
00:50:18,589 --> 00:50:21,884
Where's my father?
Where's George McFly?

635
00:50:23,052 --> 00:50:24,095
Marty.

636
00:50:24,846 --> 00:50:30,017
George, your father, is in the same place
he's been for the past 12 years.

637
00:50:32,186 --> 00:50:34,188
Oak Park Cemetery.

638
00:51:00,131 --> 00:51:01,466
No.

639
00:51:03,843 --> 00:51:07,013
No! This can't be happening!

640
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,557
"March 15, 1973."

641
00:51:10,349 --> 00:51:13,644
No! Please, God, no!

642
00:51:14,645 --> 00:51:17,398
<i>No, please, God. Please, God, no.</i>

643
00:51:17,482 --> 00:51:18,941
<i>This can't be happening.</i>

644
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:20,818
<i>This can't be happening.</i>

645
00:51:22,445 --> 00:51:23,821
<i>This can't be...</i>

646
00:51:24,155 --> 00:51:26,657
I'm afraid it is happening. All of it.

647
00:51:27,116 --> 00:51:28,284
Doc!

648
00:51:28,367 --> 00:51:31,662
When I learned about your father,
I figured you'd come here.

649
00:51:33,831 --> 00:51:36,000
Then you know
what happened to him?

650
00:51:38,044 --> 00:51:39,712
Do you know what happened...

651
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:43,716
...March 15, 1973?

652
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,095
Yes, Marty. I know.

653
00:51:48,137 --> 00:51:51,390
I went to the public library
to make sense of the madness.

654
00:51:51,474 --> 00:51:55,186
<i>The place was boarded up.</i>
<i>I broke in and borrowed newspapers.</i>

655
00:51:55,269 --> 00:51:56,521
I don't get it, Doc.

656
00:51:56,604 --> 00:52:00,149
How can all this be happening?
It's like we're in Hell or something.

657
00:52:00,233 --> 00:52:04,320
No, it's Hill Valley, although
I can't imagine Hell being much worse.

658
00:52:05,279 --> 00:52:07,990
Einie. I'm sorry, boy.

659
00:52:08,825 --> 00:52:12,161
The lab is an awful, awful mess.

660
00:52:13,371 --> 00:52:14,789
Attaboy.

661
00:52:15,498 --> 00:52:18,751
Obviously,
the time continuum has been disrupted...

662
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:21,421
...creating this new
temporal event sequence...

663
00:52:21,504 --> 00:52:24,340
- ...resulting in this alternate reality.
- English, Doc.

664
00:52:24,424 --> 00:52:26,717
Here, here, here. Let me illustrate.

665
00:52:31,347 --> 00:52:35,351
Imagine that this line represents time.

666
00:52:36,018 --> 00:52:39,772
Here's the present, 1985,
the future, and the past.

667
00:52:42,108 --> 00:52:45,278
Prior to this point in time,
somewhere in the past...

668
00:52:45,361 --> 00:52:47,697
...the time line skewed into this tangent...

669
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:50,575
...creating an alternate 1985.

670
00:52:50,867 --> 00:52:54,704
Alternate to you, me, and Einstein...

671
00:52:55,163 --> 00:52:58,207
...but reality for everyone else.

672
00:53:02,545 --> 00:53:03,921
Recognize this?

673
00:53:04,547 --> 00:53:06,674
It's the bag the sports book came in.

674
00:53:06,758 --> 00:53:09,510
I know, because the receipt
was still inside.

675
00:53:09,594 --> 00:53:13,514
I found them in the time machine,
along with this.

676
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:22,815
It's the top of Biff's cane.
I mean old Biff, from the future.

677
00:53:22,899 --> 00:53:27,195
Correct. It was in the time machine
because Biff was in the time machine...

678
00:53:27,278 --> 00:53:29,197
...with the <i>Sports Almanac</i>.

679
00:53:30,072 --> 00:53:30,990
Holy shit.

680
00:53:31,073 --> 00:53:33,993
You see, while we were in the future...

681
00:53:34,076 --> 00:53:38,206
...Biff got the sports book, stole
the time machine, went back in time...

682
00:53:38,289 --> 00:53:41,459
...and gave the book to himself
at some point in the past.

683
00:53:41,793 --> 00:53:45,797
Look. It says right here...

684
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:51,177
<i>...that Biff made his first $1,000,000</i>
<i>betting on a horserace in 1958.</i>

685
00:53:51,969 --> 00:53:53,304
He wasn't just lucky.

686
00:53:53,387 --> 00:53:56,641
He knew, because he had
the race results in the <i>Sports Almanac</i>.

687
00:53:56,974 --> 00:53:59,143
That's how he made his entire fortune.

688
00:54:00,478 --> 00:54:02,855
Look at his pocket with a magnifying glass.

689
00:54:05,233 --> 00:54:06,984
The <i>Almanac</i>.

690
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:09,695
Son of a bitch stole my idea.

691
00:54:10,655 --> 00:54:13,199
He must have been listening when I...

692
00:54:15,076 --> 00:54:16,035
It's my fault.

693
00:54:16,994 --> 00:54:20,206
The whole thing is my fault.
If I hadn't bought that damn book...

694
00:54:20,498 --> 00:54:22,333
...none of this would have happened.

695
00:54:22,417 --> 00:54:24,335
- It's all in the past.
- The future.

696
00:54:24,419 --> 00:54:29,006
Whatever. It demonstrates precisely
how time travel can be misused...

697
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:32,051
...and why the time machine
must be destroyed...

698
00:54:32,468 --> 00:54:34,637
...after we straighten all of this out.

699
00:54:34,804 --> 00:54:36,889
Right. So we go back to the future...

700
00:54:36,973 --> 00:54:39,600
...and we stop Biff
from stealing the time machine.

701
00:54:39,684 --> 00:54:44,480
We can't, because if we travel
into the future from this point in time...

702
00:54:44,564 --> 00:54:48,151
...it will be the future of this reality...

703
00:54:48,693 --> 00:54:51,279
...in which Biff is corrupt and powerful...

704
00:54:52,071 --> 00:54:54,907
...and married to your mother,
and in which...

705
00:54:56,826 --> 00:54:59,078
...this has happened to me.

706
00:55:04,625 --> 00:55:09,213
No. Our only chance to repair
the present is in the past...

707
00:55:09,464 --> 00:55:12,884
...at the point where the time line
skewed into this tangent.

708
00:55:13,634 --> 00:55:17,138
In order to put the universe back
as we remember it...

709
00:55:17,638 --> 00:55:22,101
...and get back to our reality,
we have to find out the exact date...

710
00:55:22,435 --> 00:55:25,855
...and the specific circumstances
of how, where, and when...

711
00:55:26,189 --> 00:55:29,609
...young Biff got his hands
on that <i>Sports Almanac</i>.

712
00:55:31,986 --> 00:55:32,987
I'll ask him.

713
00:55:57,178 --> 00:56:01,474
Bulletproof vest! Great flick!
Great frigging flick!

714
00:56:01,557 --> 00:56:03,351
<i>The guy is brilliant.</i>

715
00:56:03,893 --> 00:56:05,561
What the hell's going...

716
00:56:05,645 --> 00:56:10,024
- What the hell are you doing in here?
- Party's over, Biff.

717
00:56:11,275 --> 00:56:12,485
Sorry, ladies.

718
00:56:12,652 --> 00:56:15,154
How did you get past my security downstairs?

719
00:56:16,072 --> 00:56:18,074
There's a matter we need to talk about.

720
00:56:18,157 --> 00:56:22,203
- Yeah. Money, right? Well, forget it.
- No. Not money.

721
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:27,834
<i>Gray's Sports Almanac.</i>

722
00:56:31,254 --> 00:56:32,797
You heard him, girls.

723
00:56:33,589 --> 00:56:34,757
Party's over.

724
00:56:36,092 --> 00:56:38,970
Start talking, kid.
What else do you know about that book?

725
00:56:41,305 --> 00:56:43,558
First you tell me how you got it.

726
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:47,854
How, where, and when.

727
00:56:50,273 --> 00:56:52,567
All right. Take a seat.

728
00:56:56,571 --> 00:56:57,905
Sit down!

729
00:57:02,118 --> 00:57:04,912
November 12, 1955. That was when.

730
00:57:04,996 --> 00:57:08,124
November 12, 1955.
That was the date I went back...

731
00:57:09,459 --> 00:57:13,254
That was the date
of the famous Hill Valley lightning storm.

732
00:57:14,672 --> 00:57:17,216
You know your history. Very good.

733
00:57:18,259 --> 00:57:20,052
I'll never forget that Saturday.

734
00:57:20,344 --> 00:57:24,348
<i>I'd picked my car up from the shop</i>
<i>because I'd rolled it in a drag race.</i>

735
00:57:25,183 --> 00:57:27,810
I thought you crashed into a manure truck.

736
00:57:29,187 --> 00:57:30,897
How do you know about that?

737
00:57:31,856 --> 00:57:33,566
My father told me about it.

738
00:57:34,066 --> 00:57:35,443
Your father?

739
00:57:36,235 --> 00:57:37,737
Before he died.

740
00:57:39,197 --> 00:57:40,698
Yeah. Right.

741
00:57:42,116 --> 00:57:44,368
So there I was, minding my own business.

742
00:57:44,869 --> 00:57:47,246
<i>This crazy old codger with a cane shows up.</i>

743
00:57:48,372 --> 00:57:51,918
He says he's my distant relative.
I don't see any resemblance.

744
00:57:54,003 --> 00:57:56,422
<i>So he says, "How would you like to be rich?"</i>

745
00:57:57,632 --> 00:57:59,258
So I said, "Sure."

746
00:58:04,055 --> 00:58:06,099
<i>So he lays this book on me.</i>

747
00:58:06,182 --> 00:58:10,853
<i>He says this book will tell me the</i>
<i>outcome of every sporting event this century.</i>

748
00:58:11,145 --> 00:58:14,107
All I have to do is bet on the winner
and I'll never lose.

749
00:58:17,693 --> 00:58:22,406
So I said, "What's the catch?"
He says, "No catch. Just keep it a secret."

750
00:58:26,244 --> 00:58:28,079
<i>After that, he disappeared.</i>

751
00:58:28,788 --> 00:58:30,456
<i>I never saw him again.</i>

752
00:58:42,927 --> 00:58:44,804
<i>He told me one more thing.</i>

753
00:58:45,471 --> 00:58:47,932
He said, "Someday a crazy,
wild-eyed scientist...

754
00:58:48,015 --> 00:58:50,560
<i>"...or a kid may show up</i>
<i>asking about that book.</i>

755
00:58:51,602 --> 00:58:53,521
And if that ever happens..."

756
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:02,655
Funny. I never thought it would be you.

757
00:59:03,156 --> 00:59:06,617
Biff, you're forgetting one thing.
What the hell is that?

758
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:14,751
You're dead, you little son of a bitch!

759
00:59:27,847 --> 00:59:30,224
- There he is!
- Wait, kid!

760
00:59:41,152 --> 00:59:43,488
Hurry! There he is!

761
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:15,144
Go ahead, kid. Jump.

762
01:00:15,853 --> 01:00:17,730
<i>A suicide will be nice and neat.</i>

763
01:00:18,606 --> 01:00:20,274
What if I don't?

764
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:22,902
Lead poisoning.

765
01:00:23,069 --> 01:00:24,695
What about the police, Biff?

766
01:00:25,029 --> 01:00:27,490
They're going to match the bullet with that gun.

767
01:00:27,573 --> 01:00:30,159
Kid, I own the police.

768
01:00:31,619 --> 01:00:35,915
Besides, they couldn't match up
the bullet that killed your old man.

769
01:00:36,207 --> 01:00:38,459
You son of a...

770
01:00:40,545 --> 01:00:42,547
I suppose it's poetic justice.

771
01:00:43,673 --> 01:00:47,427
Two McFlys with the same gun.

772
01:00:59,105 --> 01:01:00,398
Idiot.

773
01:01:05,778 --> 01:01:07,029
What the hell...

774
01:01:11,242 --> 01:01:12,994
Nice job, Doc!

775
01:01:14,287 --> 01:01:17,915
You're not going to believe this.
We've got to go back to 1955.

776
01:01:17,999 --> 01:01:19,375
I don't believe it.

777
01:01:31,179 --> 01:01:33,890
That's right, Doc.
November 12, 1955.

778
01:01:34,015 --> 01:01:37,143
Unbelievable that old Biff
could've chosen that particular date.

779
01:01:37,226 --> 01:01:40,980
It could mean that that point in time
contains some cosmic significance...

780
01:01:41,063 --> 01:01:45,109
...as if it were the temporal junction point
of the entire space-time continuum...

781
01:01:45,318 --> 01:01:47,904
...or it could just be
an amazing coincidence.

782
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:55,495
Damn! Got to fix that thing.
All right. Time circuits on.

783
01:01:56,162 --> 01:02:00,291
What do you mean, time circuits on?
Doc, we're not going back now.

784
01:02:01,209 --> 01:02:04,378
What about Jennifer? What about Einstein?
We can't leave them.

785
01:02:04,462 --> 01:02:07,006
Don't worry.
Assuming we succeed on our mission...

786
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:10,176
...this alternate 1985
will be changed into the real 1985...

787
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:13,346
...instantaneously transforming
around Jennifer and Einie.

788
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:15,264
<i>Jennifer and Einie will be fine.</i>

789
01:02:15,348 --> 01:02:18,101
<i>They'll have no memory</i>
<i>of this horrible place.</i>

790
01:02:18,184 --> 01:02:19,185
Doc.

791
01:02:20,103 --> 01:02:24,065
- What if we don't succeed?
- We must succeed.

792
01:02:38,913 --> 01:02:40,164
This is heavy, Doc.

793
01:02:40,373 --> 01:02:42,041
It's like I was here yesterday.

794
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:45,169
You were here yesterday, Marty.
Amazing, isn't it?

795
01:02:45,294 --> 01:02:48,089
Sunrise should be in about 22 minutes.

796
01:02:48,548 --> 01:02:52,009
You go into town.
Track down young Biff and tail him.

797
01:02:52,093 --> 01:02:55,972
Sometime today, old Biff will show up
to give young Biff the <i>Almanac</i>.

798
01:02:56,139 --> 01:02:58,224
Above all you must not interfere.

799
01:02:58,307 --> 01:03:01,310
Let old Biff believe he's succeeded
so he'll leave 1955...

800
01:03:01,394 --> 01:03:03,729
- ...and bring the DeLorean to the future.
- Right.

801
01:03:03,813 --> 01:03:06,899
Once old Biff is gone,
grab the <i>Almanac</i> anyway that you can.

802
01:03:07,024 --> 01:03:11,070
- Remember, our futures depend on this.
- You don't have to remind me of that.

803
01:03:11,279 --> 01:03:15,533
Here's some binoculars
and a walkie-talkie to keep in contact.

804
01:03:15,992 --> 01:03:18,828
<i>I'll stay and repair the short in the time circuit.</i>

805
01:03:18,911 --> 01:03:22,081
That way, we don't risk anyone else
stealing the time machine...

806
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:26,294
...and I won't risk
accidentally running into my other self.

807
01:03:26,377 --> 01:03:29,589
- Other self?
- Yes. There are now two of me here...

808
01:03:29,714 --> 01:03:31,549
...and there are two of you here.

809
01:03:31,674 --> 01:03:35,553
The other me is
the Dr. Emmett Brown from 1955.

810
01:03:35,845 --> 01:03:40,516
<i>The other me that helps</i>
<i>the other you get back to 1985.</i>

811
01:03:41,434 --> 01:03:45,605
Remember the lightning bolt at the clock tower?
That doesn't happen until tonight.

812
01:03:45,688 --> 01:03:49,525
Be careful not to run into your other self.
Let me give you some money.

813
01:03:52,987 --> 01:03:55,782
Have to be prepared
for all monetary possibilities.

814
01:03:56,324 --> 01:03:59,243
- Get yourself some '50s clothes.
- Check, Doc.

815
01:04:00,495 --> 01:04:02,038
Something inconspicuous.

816
01:04:03,623 --> 01:04:05,875
Doc. Come in. This is Marty. Over.

817
01:04:06,584 --> 01:04:10,922
- <i>Roger, this is Doc. Are you there?</i>
- Yeah, Doc. I'm at the address.

818
01:04:11,964 --> 01:04:15,635
<i>It's the only Tannen in the book,</i>
<i>but I don't think this is Biff's house.</i>

819
01:04:15,718 --> 01:04:17,512
<i>It looks like an old lady lives here.</i>

820
01:04:17,595 --> 01:04:19,097
- Biff!
- Yeah.

821
01:04:19,764 --> 01:04:23,893
- Where are you going, Biff?
- I'm going to get my car, Grandma.

822
01:04:23,976 --> 01:04:27,313
When are you coming back?
I want you to rub my toes.

823
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:29,524
Shut up, you old bag.

824
01:04:29,816 --> 01:04:31,609
Give us our ball back.

825
01:04:32,193 --> 01:04:34,028
- What ball?
- That ball!

826
01:04:34,112 --> 01:04:35,696
What are you talking about?

827
01:04:36,197 --> 01:04:38,032
Give us our ball!

828
01:04:38,157 --> 01:04:39,575
Ball?

829
01:04:39,951 --> 01:04:41,953
- Is this your ball?
- Yeah!

830
01:04:42,036 --> 01:04:43,663
- You want it back?
- Yeah.

831
01:04:46,374 --> 01:04:47,834
Go get it.

832
01:04:51,629 --> 01:04:56,008
Doc, it is Biff's house. I'm on him. Over.

833
01:05:09,105 --> 01:05:12,316
She's all fixed up,
but I couldn't get her started.

834
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:15,987
- Got a kill switch?
- You just need the right touch.

835
01:05:16,070 --> 01:05:18,489
Nobody can start this car but me.

836
01:05:18,656 --> 01:05:21,409
- The bill comes to $302.57.
- $300?

837
01:05:21,492 --> 01:05:24,120
$300 for a couple of dents? That's bullshit.

838
01:05:24,203 --> 01:05:26,622
It was horseshit.
The whole car was horseshit.

839
01:05:26,706 --> 01:05:29,876
- Jones wanted $80 to haul it away.
- I bet he resold it.

840
01:05:29,959 --> 01:05:32,962
- I got to get something.
- You want something?

841
01:05:33,045 --> 01:05:35,965
You can call Jones and
if he wants to give you a refund--

842
01:05:36,048 --> 01:05:40,845
$300! If I catch the guy
that caused this I'll break his neck.

843
01:05:41,471 --> 01:05:44,348
The manure. I remember that.

844
01:05:50,730 --> 01:05:52,148
4 cans of Valvoline.

845
01:05:52,815 --> 01:05:56,068
- 4 cans for a $300 job?
- I can't have lunch in there.

846
01:05:56,152 --> 01:05:59,197
- Makes me nauseous.
- I should get a case for $300.

847
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,616
It smells worse than the bathroom.

848
01:06:01,824 --> 01:06:05,161
<i>The stench is never going to go away, Biff.</i>

849
01:06:05,244 --> 01:06:07,663
<i>Last time I do you a favor. Last time.</i>

850
01:06:14,295 --> 01:06:18,883
It's perfect, Lorraine.
You're going to look so good!

851
01:06:24,055 --> 01:06:25,348
You're going to look--

852
01:06:25,431 --> 01:06:28,226
Look at what we have here.
Nice dress, Lorraine.

853
01:06:28,309 --> 01:06:30,895
Although I think you'd look better
wearing nothing.

854
01:06:31,312 --> 01:06:35,942
- Take a long walk off a short pier.
- There's that dance at school tonight.

855
01:06:36,025 --> 01:06:37,485
<i>Now that my car's fixed...</i>

856
01:06:37,568 --> 01:06:41,322
...I'll give you the honor of going
with the best-looking guy in school.

857
01:06:41,405 --> 01:06:42,406
I'm busy.

858
01:06:42,490 --> 01:06:44,117
- Doing what?
- Washing my hair.

859
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,744
That's as funny
as a screen door on a battleship.

860
01:06:46,953 --> 01:06:49,247
Screen door on a submarine, you dork.

861
01:06:49,372 --> 01:06:51,916
Biff, somebody already asked me
to the dance.

862
01:06:52,291 --> 01:06:54,335
Who? That bug George McFly?

863
01:06:55,169 --> 01:06:59,590
- I'm going with Calvin Klein, okay?
- Calvin Klein? No, it's not okay.

864
01:07:00,299 --> 01:07:03,553
- You're going with me, understand?
- Get your cooties off me!

865
01:07:03,636 --> 01:07:07,181
When will you get it through your skull?
You're my girl.

866
01:07:08,015 --> 01:07:11,519
I wouldn't be your girl
even if you had a million dollars!

867
01:07:15,273 --> 01:07:18,443
Yes, you will! It's you and me, Lorraine.

868
01:07:18,651 --> 01:07:19,777
Watch it!

869
01:07:20,027 --> 01:07:21,446
It's meant to be.

870
01:07:21,863 --> 01:07:26,033
I'm going to marry you someday, Lorraine.
Someday you'll be my wife!

871
01:07:29,245 --> 01:07:31,372
You always did have a way with women.

872
01:07:31,914 --> 01:07:33,791
Get the hell out of my car, old man.

873
01:07:33,875 --> 01:07:36,961
You want to marry that girl?
I can help make it happen.

874
01:07:37,044 --> 01:07:40,965
- Who are you, Miss Lonely-hearts?
- Just get in the car, butthead.

875
01:07:42,091 --> 01:07:44,260
Who are you calling butthead, butthead?

876
01:07:45,052 --> 01:07:47,847
How did you do that?
Nobody can start this car but me.

877
01:07:48,848 --> 01:07:52,560
Get in the car, Tannen.
Today's your lucky day.

878
01:07:56,814 --> 01:07:59,066
Watch where you're driving, old man.

879
01:07:59,150 --> 01:08:01,402
<i>If you dent this car, I'll kill you.</i>

880
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:11,662
- This cost me $300!
- Would you shut up about the car?

881
01:08:11,996 --> 01:08:15,500
- How do you know where I live?
- Let's just say we're related, Biff.

882
01:08:16,084 --> 01:08:18,419
That being the case, I got a present for you.

883
01:08:18,503 --> 01:08:20,379
Something that'll make you rich.

884
01:08:20,963 --> 01:08:24,926
- You want to be rich, don't you?
- Yeah. Sure. Right. That's rich.

885
01:08:25,176 --> 01:08:26,844
You're going to make me rich?

886
01:08:27,512 --> 01:08:30,515
You see this book?
This book tells the future.

887
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:34,477
Tells the results of every major sports event
till the end of this century.

888
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:38,439
Football, baseball, horseraces, boxing.

889
01:08:39,482 --> 01:08:43,194
The information in here is worth millions,
and I'm giving it to you.

890
01:08:43,361 --> 01:08:45,613
That's very nice. Thank you very much.

891
01:08:45,863 --> 01:08:49,700
Now, why don't you make like a tree
and get out of here?

892
01:08:50,743 --> 01:08:54,414
It's leave, you idiot. Make like a tree and leave.

893
01:08:54,497 --> 01:08:56,874
You sound like a fool when you say it wrong.

894
01:08:56,958 --> 01:08:59,669
All right, leave. And take your book with you.

895
01:09:00,753 --> 01:09:04,257
Don't you get it?
You could make a fortune with this book.

896
01:09:04,590 --> 01:09:05,842
Let me show you.

897
01:09:10,263 --> 01:09:12,974
<i>UCLA trails 17-16.</i>

898
01:09:13,057 --> 01:09:16,519
<i>It's 4th and 11</i>
<i>with only 18 seconds left of this game.</i>

899
01:09:16,602 --> 01:09:19,021
<i>I'd say it's all over for UCLA.</i>

900
01:09:19,689 --> 01:09:23,359
Bet you a million bucks UCLA wins it 19-17.

901
01:09:23,693 --> 01:09:28,072
- What are you, deaf? It's over. You lost.
- Yeah?

902
01:09:29,115 --> 01:09:32,034
<i>Here comes Decker with the kick.</i>
<i>It's up and looks good.</i>

903
01:09:32,118 --> 01:09:36,414
<i>Ball's in the clear.</i>
<i>Field goal! UCLA wins 19-17.</i>

904
01:09:36,831 --> 01:09:40,585
<i>Listen to that Coliseum crowd go wild.</i>
<i>Jim Decker...</i>

905
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:44,172
All right. What's the gag?
How did you know what the score would be?

906
01:09:44,255 --> 01:09:46,340
I told you, it's in this book.

907
01:09:46,466 --> 01:09:49,761
All you got to do is bet on the winner,
and you'll never lose.

908
01:09:55,475 --> 01:09:57,393
All right. I'll take a look at it.

909
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:02,190
You damn fool!

910
01:10:02,648 --> 01:10:05,526
Never leave this book laying around.

911
01:10:05,651 --> 01:10:08,529
Don't you have a safe?
No, you don't have a safe.

912
01:10:09,739 --> 01:10:14,327
Get a safe. Keep it locked up.
Until then, keep it on you.

913
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:17,663
- What are you doing?
- Don't tell anybody, either.

914
01:10:17,747 --> 01:10:22,752
There's one more thing.
One day, a kid or a crazy old man...

915
01:10:23,086 --> 01:10:26,506
<i>...who claims to be a scientist</i>
<i>is going to come around asking...</i>

916
01:10:51,614 --> 01:10:53,866
I'm trapped. Doc.

917
01:10:54,075 --> 01:10:55,284
<i>Doc, come in.</i>

918
01:10:55,368 --> 01:10:57,161
- What's the report?
- <i>Biff's gone.</i>

919
01:10:58,329 --> 01:11:00,915
He's got the book.
I'm locked in Biff's garage.

920
01:11:01,541 --> 01:11:03,167
<i>Get me the hell out of here.</i>

921
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:05,378
I'm at 1809 Mason Street.

922
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:09,507
I can't take the DeLorean.
Don't worry. Somehow I'll get there.

923
01:11:09,590 --> 01:11:12,927
Doc, wait a minute. Doc. Doc.

924
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:15,805
Perfect.

925
01:11:19,267 --> 01:11:22,562
Biff! Where are you going now?

926
01:11:22,937 --> 01:11:25,314
I told you, Grandma,
I'm going to the dance.

927
01:11:25,398 --> 01:11:27,775
- When you coming home?
- The dance.

928
01:11:27,859 --> 01:11:29,610
I'll get home when I get home.

929
01:11:31,904 --> 01:11:34,782
Don't forget to turn out
the garage light.

930
01:12:06,773 --> 01:12:08,316
Marty. Marty!

931
01:12:09,025 --> 01:12:09,942
<i>Marty.</i>

932
01:12:12,278 --> 01:12:14,739
Marty, Marty. Damn!

933
01:12:15,531 --> 01:12:17,200
Where is that kid?

934
01:12:24,082 --> 01:12:26,042
Doc. Doc, come in.

935
01:12:26,918 --> 01:12:27,960
<i>Come in, Doc.</i>

936
01:12:28,836 --> 01:12:30,129
Marty! Come in.

937
01:12:30,546 --> 01:12:31,464
Doc.

938
01:12:35,551 --> 01:12:36,469
Marty.

939
01:12:37,762 --> 01:12:38,846
My...

940
01:12:41,015 --> 01:12:43,059
Great Scott.

941
01:12:58,658 --> 01:12:59,742
My God.

942
01:13:05,206 --> 01:13:06,332
Doc, Doc, come in.

943
01:13:06,833 --> 01:13:09,627
Marty, what happened?
You weren't at Biff's house.

944
01:13:09,794 --> 01:13:13,714
I'm in Biff's car, heading for
the Enchantment Under The Sea dance.

945
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:18,511
We may have to abort this entire plan.
It's getting much too dangerous.

946
01:13:18,594 --> 01:13:21,722
The book's on his dashboard.
I'll grab it when we arrive.

947
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:25,476
You must be careful
not to run into your other self.

948
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:26,811
- <i>My other self?</i>
- Yes.

949
01:13:27,728 --> 01:13:31,274
Remember your mother is
at that exact same dance with you.

950
01:13:31,357 --> 01:13:35,319
- <i>Right. This could get heavy, Doc.</i>
- Heavy, heavy.

951
01:13:35,403 --> 01:13:38,156
Whatever happens,
don't let your other self see you!

952
01:13:38,239 --> 01:13:41,784
- The consequences could be disastrous.
- Excuse me, sir.

953
01:13:42,827 --> 01:13:44,162
Yes, you with the hat.

954
01:13:44,537 --> 01:13:47,081
- Who, me?
- Yes.

955
01:13:47,206 --> 01:13:50,460
Be a pal and hand me a five-eighths inch wrench
from the toolbox.

956
01:13:51,878 --> 01:13:53,296
Five-eighths?

957
01:13:55,089 --> 01:13:57,633
Don't you mean three-quarters?

958
01:13:58,426 --> 01:14:00,470
Why, you're right.

959
01:14:01,179 --> 01:14:05,767
I presume you're conducting
some sort of weather experiment.

960
01:14:07,894 --> 01:14:10,813
That's right. How did you know that?

961
01:14:11,063 --> 01:14:14,525
I happen to have had a little experience
in this area.

962
01:14:15,026 --> 01:14:17,862
I'm hoping to see some lightning tonight...

963
01:14:17,945 --> 01:14:20,907
...although the weatherman says
there's no chance of rain.

964
01:14:20,990 --> 01:14:24,202
There's going to be plenty of rain.
Wind, thunder, lightning.

965
01:14:24,869 --> 01:14:28,915
- It's going to be one hell of a storm.
- Thanks. Nice talking to you.

966
01:14:29,373 --> 01:14:32,210
Maybe we'll bump into each other again
in the future.

967
01:14:34,087 --> 01:14:35,588
Or in the past.

968
01:15:16,796 --> 01:15:18,548
Doc, Doc! Come in!

969
01:16:31,204 --> 01:16:34,582
Where's that punk Calvin Klein, anyway?

970
01:16:34,665 --> 01:16:36,834
I don't know. I ain't his secretary.

971
01:16:36,918 --> 01:16:39,796
Well, find him.
He caused me $300 damage.

972
01:16:39,879 --> 01:16:42,423
I owe him a knuckle sandwich. Get going!

973
01:16:43,925 --> 01:16:46,177
- Aren't you coming?
- I'm reading.

974
01:17:38,855 --> 01:17:40,898
Well, well, Mr. Tannen.

975
01:17:42,150 --> 01:17:43,985
<i>How nice to see you here.</i>

976
01:17:44,193 --> 01:17:48,614
- Why, Mr. Strickland, nice to see you, sir.
- Is that liquor I smell, Tannen?

977
01:17:49,115 --> 01:17:50,408
I wouldn't know.

978
01:17:50,491 --> 01:17:53,619
I don't know what it smells like
because I'm too young to drink it.

979
01:17:53,703 --> 01:17:54,746
I see.

980
01:17:55,371 --> 01:17:57,248
What have we here?

981
01:18:00,752 --> 01:18:04,172
Sports stats,
interesting subject. Homework, Tannen?

982
01:18:04,255 --> 01:18:07,717
No, it ain't homework,
because, I ain't at home.

983
01:18:09,010 --> 01:18:11,846
You got a real attitude problem, you know?

984
01:18:11,929 --> 01:18:14,974
One day I'll have you where I want you,
in detention.

985
01:18:15,892 --> 01:18:16,934
Slacker!

986
01:18:29,572 --> 01:18:31,199
Jesus, you smoke, too?

987
01:18:31,282 --> 01:18:34,368
Marty,
you sound just like my mother.

988
01:18:34,452 --> 01:18:35,870
Yeah, right.

989
01:18:35,953 --> 01:18:39,248
When I have kids,
I'll let them do anything they want.

990
01:18:39,332 --> 01:18:40,750
<i>Anything at all.</i>

991
01:18:41,125 --> 01:18:43,836
- I'd like to have that in writing.
- Yeah, me, too.

992
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:46,506
Marty, why are you so nervous?

993
01:20:52,173 --> 01:20:53,216
Yes!

994
01:20:57,178 --> 01:20:58,137
No!

995
01:21:00,723 --> 01:21:02,475
<i>"Oh LL"?</i>

996
01:21:03,059 --> 01:21:04,435
<i>"Oh LL"?</i>

997
01:21:06,729 --> 01:21:08,147
<i>"Oh LL"?</i>

998
01:21:13,903 --> 01:21:16,489
- Doc! Doc!
- Hey, you.

999
01:21:16,572 --> 01:21:19,492
- Doc, come in!
- <i>Marty, what's up?</i>

1000
01:21:19,575 --> 01:21:22,245
Doc! I'm in trouble. I blew it.

1001
01:21:22,328 --> 01:21:24,705
- Where's the book?
- <i>Biff must have it.</i>

1002
01:21:24,789 --> 01:21:27,375
- I've only got the cover.
- <i>Where's Biff?</i>

1003
01:21:27,458 --> 01:21:29,502
- <i>You're asking for it.</i>
- I don't know.

1004
01:21:29,585 --> 01:21:33,423
- <i>Any idea?</i>
- No! He could be anywhere by now.

1005
01:21:33,506 --> 01:21:37,135
The entire future depends on you
getting that book!

1006
01:21:37,218 --> 01:21:39,929
- I know. I just don't--
- Stop it!

1007
01:21:40,054 --> 01:21:43,891
<i>Stop it, Biff. You'll break his arm. Stop it!</i>

1008
01:21:47,687 --> 01:21:48,771
Of course!

1009
01:21:49,772 --> 01:21:53,901
I gotta go. I got one chance!
My old man is about to deck Biff!

1010
01:22:01,367 --> 01:22:02,243
Yes!

1011
01:22:15,882 --> 01:22:17,800
Talk about dj vu.

1012
01:22:17,884 --> 01:22:19,761
Are you okay?

1013
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:41,240
Okay, everybody, let's back up.

1014
01:22:41,324 --> 01:22:45,369
Everybody just back up.
Give him a little bit of room.

1015
01:22:45,912 --> 01:22:47,830
It's okay. I know CPR.

1016
01:22:48,081 --> 01:22:49,749
I know CPR.

1017
01:22:50,416 --> 01:22:52,877
- What's CPR?
- You!

1018
01:22:56,506 --> 01:22:59,550
- He's fine.
- Did you just take his wallet?

1019
01:22:59,634 --> 01:23:01,427
He took that guy's wallet.

1020
01:23:01,844 --> 01:23:03,930
<i>Doc, success. I got it.</i>

1021
01:23:04,347 --> 01:23:06,265
Thank goodness.

1022
01:23:07,266 --> 01:23:08,518
Great, Marty.

1023
01:23:09,018 --> 01:23:13,481
As soon as I reload the fusion generator
we'll meet on the roof of the school gym.

1024
01:23:13,564 --> 01:23:14,899
On the roof. 10-4.

1025
01:23:14,982 --> 01:23:17,944
- It's him!
- He's in disguise.

1026
01:23:18,194 --> 01:23:19,821
Guys, what's that?

1027
01:23:21,697 --> 01:23:23,408
Come on! Let's get him!

1028
01:23:30,748 --> 01:23:31,666
Damn!

1029
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:13,332
All right! Let's do another.

1030
01:24:13,416 --> 01:24:16,294
Where did he go?
He just came in here!

1031
01:24:19,505 --> 01:24:23,301
- Look! How did he get on stage?
- When he's through, we'll nail him.

1032
01:24:23,384 --> 01:24:25,762
How did he change his clothes so fast?

1033
01:24:25,887 --> 01:24:28,264
<i>It's an oldie</i>
<i>where I come from.</i>

1034
01:24:28,473 --> 01:24:30,683
<i>All right, guys, blues riff in B.</i>

1035
01:24:30,767 --> 01:24:34,103
<i>Watch me for the changes,</i>
<i>and try and keep up, okay?</i>

1036
01:24:39,942 --> 01:24:41,235
<i>Doc, come in!</i>

1037
01:24:41,319 --> 01:24:42,195
Come in.

1038
01:24:42,278 --> 01:24:46,699
Listen, Biff's guys chased me into the gym.
They're going to jump "me."

1039
01:24:46,783 --> 01:24:48,201
Get out of there!

1040
01:24:48,284 --> 01:24:52,663
No, not me. The other me.
The one on stage playing <i>Johnny B. Goode</i>.

1041
01:24:53,706 --> 01:24:57,668
He could miss his opportunity to return!
We'll have a major paradox!

1042
01:24:57,752 --> 01:24:59,253
Wait. A paradox?

1043
01:24:59,504 --> 01:25:02,173
One of those things
that could destroy the universe?

1044
01:25:03,049 --> 01:25:07,470
You have to stop those guys
without being seen by your other self.

1045
01:25:07,553 --> 01:25:08,721
10-4.

1046
01:25:10,098 --> 01:25:11,557
What the hell?

1047
01:25:15,144 --> 01:25:16,646
- Where is he?
- Who?

1048
01:25:16,729 --> 01:25:18,189
- Calvin Klein.
- Who?

1049
01:25:18,356 --> 01:25:21,025
- With the hat, where is he?
- He went that way.

1050
01:25:21,859 --> 01:25:23,945
I think he took your wallet.

1051
01:25:24,237 --> 01:25:25,905
I think he took his wallet.

1052
01:27:21,979 --> 01:27:24,690
<i>I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet...</i>

1053
01:27:25,858 --> 01:27:28,403
<i>...but your kids are going to love it.</i>

1054
01:27:36,744 --> 01:27:38,913
Doc, success. Everything's cool.

1055
01:27:39,205 --> 01:27:42,333
<i>Great. I'll be landing</i>
<i>at the roof in one minute.</i>

1056
01:27:42,458 --> 01:27:43,793
I'll be there.

1057
01:27:51,634 --> 01:27:52,677
Lorraine.

1058
01:27:52,927 --> 01:27:56,806
Marty, that was very interesting music.

1059
01:28:01,686 --> 01:28:03,729
I hope you don't mind.
George asked to take me home.

1060
01:28:03,813 --> 01:28:07,150
Yeah. Great. Great.
I had a feeling about you two.

1061
01:28:07,233 --> 01:28:08,818
I had a feeling, too.

1062
01:28:09,652 --> 01:28:11,028
Butthead!

1063
01:28:12,238 --> 01:28:15,199
You think that stupid disguise can get by me?

1064
01:28:15,950 --> 01:28:17,493
Let's have it out.

1065
01:28:17,744 --> 01:28:20,371
You and me, right now.

1066
01:28:21,038 --> 01:28:22,457
No, thanks.

1067
01:28:24,417 --> 01:28:25,877
What's the matter?

1068
01:28:26,502 --> 01:28:28,171
Where are you going?

1069
01:28:28,671 --> 01:28:30,214
Are you chicken?

1070
01:28:31,716 --> 01:28:33,176
That's it, isn't it?

1071
01:28:33,259 --> 01:28:35,261
Nothing but a little chicken.

1072
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:53,071
Nobody calls me a--

1073
01:29:01,412 --> 01:29:02,705
What the hell...

1074
01:29:05,041 --> 01:29:06,751
You steal my stuff?

1075
01:29:08,544 --> 01:29:10,630
And this one's for my car!

1076
01:29:37,490 --> 01:29:39,867
Doc! I blew it.

1077
01:29:40,326 --> 01:29:43,830
Biff nailed me. He took the book.
He drove away with it in his car.

1078
01:29:43,913 --> 01:29:46,040
It's my fault. I should have left sooner.

1079
01:29:46,124 --> 01:29:49,127
- No time for that. Where did he go?
- To the River Road Tunnel.

1080
01:29:49,210 --> 01:29:50,169
Get in!

1081
01:30:01,597 --> 01:30:02,807
Yes!

1082
01:30:03,266 --> 01:30:05,059
There he is, Doc!

1083
01:30:05,143 --> 01:30:09,105
- Let's land on him and cripple his car.
- That's a '46 Ford. We're a DeLorean.

1084
01:30:09,188 --> 01:30:11,107
He'll rip us like tin foil.

1085
01:30:11,816 --> 01:30:13,818
- So what do we do?
- I have a plan.

1086
01:30:13,901 --> 01:30:19,157
<i>Repeating tonight's weather bulletin,</i>
<i>a severe thunderstorm is heading for Hill Valley.</i>

1087
01:30:40,845 --> 01:30:43,139
<i>Serving Hill Valley and Hill County...</i>

1088
01:30:43,222 --> 01:30:46,517
<i>...you're tuned to KKHV, the voice of Hill Valley.</i>

1089
01:30:54,108 --> 01:30:58,112
<i>Turning to community calendar,</i>
<i>the Hill Valley Women's Club bake sale...</i>

1090
01:30:58,196 --> 01:31:00,573
<i>...will be held tomorrow from 2:00 to 5:00...</i>

1091
01:31:00,656 --> 01:31:03,242
<i>...at the community center on Forest Road.</i>

1092
01:31:03,326 --> 01:31:07,163
<i>For you sports fans,</i>
<i>there was much action today in college football.</i>

1093
01:31:07,246 --> 01:31:09,332
<i>Here's what happened to the top 10.</i>

1094
01:31:09,415 --> 01:31:13,002
<i>UCLA narrowly defeated Washington 19-17.</i>

1095
01:31:13,169 --> 01:31:16,380
<i>Michigan State crushed Minnesota 42-14.</i>

1096
01:31:16,589 --> 01:31:19,092
<i>Ohio State beat Iowa 20-10.</i>

1097
01:31:19,383 --> 01:31:21,969
- <i>Michigan blanked Indiana 30-0.</i>
- Shit.

1098
01:31:22,053 --> 01:31:25,264
- <i>It was Notre Dame over North Carolina...</i>
- Son of a bitch.

1099
01:31:25,348 --> 01:31:28,267
<i>Oklahoma ripped Iowa State 52-0.</i>

1100
01:31:29,143 --> 01:31:32,188
<i>West Virginia lost to Pittsburgh 26-7.</i>

1101
01:31:32,355 --> 01:31:35,108
<i>Texas A&M over Rice 20-10.</i>

1102
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:37,985
<i>Maryland defeated Clemson 25-12...</i>

1103
01:31:38,069 --> 01:31:41,989
<i>...and it was Texas Christian over Texas 47-20.</i>

1104
01:31:42,156 --> 01:31:45,618
<i>Repeating tonight's earlier weather bulletin,</i>
<i>a severe thundershower...</i>

1105
01:31:45,701 --> 01:31:46,994
You again?

1106
01:31:48,454 --> 01:31:49,622
God!

1107
01:31:50,915 --> 01:31:52,291
Let it go!

1108
01:31:59,507 --> 01:32:01,050
Let go of this car!

1109
01:32:35,042 --> 01:32:36,753
That'll teach him.

1110
01:34:11,139 --> 01:34:12,890
Go, Doc!

1111
01:34:12,974 --> 01:34:14,517
Hold on, Marty!

1112
01:34:19,981 --> 01:34:21,149
Shit!

1113
01:34:27,864 --> 01:34:28,990
Yes!

1114
01:34:39,083 --> 01:34:42,378
Manure! I hate manure!

1115
01:35:06,402 --> 01:35:08,946
Doc, is everything all right? Over.

1116
01:35:09,113 --> 01:35:11,741
<i>It's very miserable flying weather...</i>

1117
01:35:11,824 --> 01:35:14,577
...much too turbulent
for a landing from this direction.

1118
01:35:14,660 --> 01:35:17,997
I'll have to approach from the south.
Have you got the book?

1119
01:35:18,664 --> 01:35:21,084
In my hand, Doc! I got it in my hand!

1120
01:35:21,667 --> 01:35:22,710
Burn it!

1121
01:35:23,169 --> 01:35:24,295
Check!

1122
01:36:19,934 --> 01:36:22,937
Doc! Doc! The newspaper changed.

1123
01:36:23,020 --> 01:36:24,814
Doc, my father's alive!

1124
01:36:25,064 --> 01:36:27,567
<i>That means everything's back to normal, right?</i>

1125
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:33,281
Mission accomplished.

1126
01:36:33,614 --> 01:36:36,367
That means Jennifer's okay
and Einie's okay, right?

1127
01:36:36,451 --> 01:36:39,328
That's right, Marty. It's the ripple effect.

1128
01:36:39,495 --> 01:36:41,706
The future is back, so let's go home.

1129
01:36:41,789 --> 01:36:44,500
Right. Let's get our asses back to the--

1130
01:36:50,715 --> 01:36:52,592
Doc, Doc, are you okay?

1131
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:54,093
<i>That was a close one.</i>

1132
01:36:54,177 --> 01:36:56,137
I almost bought the farm.

1133
01:36:59,390 --> 01:37:02,852
Well, be careful.
You don't want to get struck by lightning.

1134
01:37:17,408 --> 01:37:18,534
Doc.

1135
01:37:27,502 --> 01:37:28,586
Doc?

1136
01:37:29,754 --> 01:37:31,464
Doc, come in, Doc.

1137
01:37:33,132 --> 01:37:34,675
Doc, do you read me?

1138
01:37:35,927 --> 01:37:38,221
Do you read me, Doc? Come in.

1139
01:37:38,679 --> 01:37:39,639
Doc.

1140
01:37:52,276 --> 01:37:53,277
No.

1141
01:38:02,078 --> 01:38:03,246
He's gone.

1142
01:38:05,581 --> 01:38:07,083
<i>The Doc's gone.</i>

1143
01:38:30,064 --> 01:38:31,774
Mr. McFly!

1144
01:38:36,112 --> 01:38:38,364
Is your name Marty McFly?

1145
01:38:43,578 --> 01:38:44,495
Yeah.

1146
01:38:46,914 --> 01:38:49,208
I've got something for you.

1147
01:38:51,502 --> 01:38:52,670
A letter.

1148
01:38:54,213 --> 01:38:56,215
A letter for me?

1149
01:38:57,175 --> 01:38:58,634
That's impossible.

1150
01:39:00,261 --> 01:39:02,847
- Who the hell are you?
- Western Union.

1151
01:39:03,306 --> 01:39:07,769
Many of us at the office were hoping
you could shed some light on the subject.

1152
01:39:08,186 --> 01:39:10,229
We've had that envelope in our possession...

1153
01:39:10,271 --> 01:39:12,982
...for the past 70 years.

1154
01:39:15,568 --> 01:39:18,571
It was given to us
with the explicit instructions...

1155
01:39:18,654 --> 01:39:22,742
<i>...that it be delivered</i>
<i>to a young man with your description...</i>

1156
01:39:22,909 --> 01:39:27,288
...answering to the name of Marty
at this exact location...

1157
01:39:27,538 --> 01:39:31,584
...at this exact minute, November 12, 1955.

1158
01:39:32,001 --> 01:39:35,129
We had a bet going on whether this Marty
would actually be here.

1159
01:39:35,296 --> 01:39:36,756
Looks like I lost.

1160
01:39:37,965 --> 01:39:39,467
Did you say 70 years?

1161
01:39:39,550 --> 01:39:44,222
Yes. 70 years, 2 months, 12 days, to be exact.
Sign on line 6, please.

1162
01:39:44,305 --> 01:39:45,681
Here you are.

1163
01:39:56,359 --> 01:39:58,736
It's from the Doc!

1164
01:40:02,240 --> 01:40:05,076
Dear Marty,
if my calculations are correct...

1165
01:40:05,159 --> 01:40:09,747
<i>"...you will receive this letter immediately after</i>
<i>the DeLorean's struck by lightning.</i>

1166
01:40:09,831 --> 01:40:12,708
First let me assure you I'm alive and well.

1167
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:16,379
I've been living happily
these past eight months in the year 1885.

1168
01:40:16,462 --> 01:40:18,089
The lightning bolt..."

1169
01:40:18,339 --> 01:40:19,632
1885!

1170
01:40:20,174 --> 01:40:21,843
<i>"September, 1885."</i>

1171
01:40:22,510 --> 01:40:25,596
Wait, kid!
Wait a minute. What's this all about?

1172
01:40:25,888 --> 01:40:27,390
He's alive!

1173
01:40:27,640 --> 01:40:29,183
The Doc's alive!

1174
01:40:29,475 --> 01:40:33,604
- He's in the Old West, but he's alive.
- Kid, you all right?

1175
01:40:33,771 --> 01:40:35,231
Need any help?

1176
01:40:35,565 --> 01:40:37,900
There's only one man who can help me.

1177
01:41:53,184 --> 01:41:54,894
Doc! Doc!

1178
01:41:55,686 --> 01:41:57,522
Doc! Doc!

1179
01:41:59,273 --> 01:42:01,609
Relax, Doc. It's me. It's me! It's Marty.

1180
01:42:01,692 --> 01:42:04,237
Impossible. I sent you back to the future.

1181
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:06,322
I know, you did send me back...

1182
01:42:06,614 --> 01:42:09,367
...but I'm back. I'm back from the future.

1183
01:42:12,829 --> 01:42:14,455
Great Scott!

1184
01:42:16,582 --> 01:42:17,417
Doc!

1185
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,085
Doc.

1186
01:42:19,460 --> 01:42:20,628
Doc.

1187
01:42:41,357 --> 01:42:42,525
McFly.

1188
01:42:50,158 --> 01:42:52,201
That's right, Tannen!

1189
01:42:52,618 --> 01:42:55,538
Come on, runt! You can dance better than that!
