RETAIL

2
00:00:58,595 --> 00:00:59,875
Should we help him?

3
00:01:00,263 --> 00:01:03,881
He's due in the lists in two minutes.
Two minutes or forfeit.

4
00:01:04,225 --> 00:01:05,601
Lend us those.

5
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,596
Right. Left.

6
00:01:20,241 --> 00:01:22,732
-Dead.
-Eh?

7
00:01:24,537 --> 00:01:26,743
Three scores to none after two lances.

8
00:01:27,081 --> 00:01:30,450
As long as Sir Ector doesn't
fall off his horse, we've won.

9
00:01:32,336 --> 00:01:33,914
He's dead.

10
00:01:35,589 --> 00:01:39,539
-What do you mean?
-His life's spark is covered in shite.

11
00:01:40,761 --> 00:01:43,299
His spirit is gone
but his stench remains.

12
00:01:43,513 --> 00:01:47,048
-Does that answer your question?
-No, no, no.

13
00:01:47,309 --> 00:01:49,634
No, he sleeps. Rouse him.

14
00:01:50,604 --> 00:01:52,892
I haven't eaten in three days!

15
00:01:53,106 --> 00:01:54,434
None of us have!

16
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:57,935
-Let's fetch a priest.
-No, he's not dead!

17
00:01:58,278 --> 00:02:01,232
You wake up! Come on!

18
00:02:02,157 --> 00:02:03,319
Come on!

19
00:02:05,618 --> 00:02:07,410
You manky git!

20
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:10,163
Roland.

21
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:16,336
Squire, Sir Ector must report
at once or forfeit the match.

22
00:02:17,296 --> 00:02:18,671
He's on his way.

23
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:23,416
I haven't eaten in three days!

24
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:25,842
Three days! What did you eat, mate?

25
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,671
If you wasn't dead, I would kill you!

26
00:02:29,058 --> 00:02:30,801
I'll ride in his place.

27
00:02:32,227 --> 00:02:35,228
Strip his armor.
I'm riding in his place.

28
00:02:35,564 --> 00:02:39,561
Wat, stop kicking him!
I'm riding in his place. Help me.

29
00:02:40,444 --> 00:02:41,772
What's your name, William?

30
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:47,151
William Thatcher, answer me
with your name.

31
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:50,149
It's not Sir William.

32
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,075
It's not Count or Duke or King William.

33
00:02:53,498 --> 00:02:54,494
I know that.

34
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,867
You must be of noble birth to compete.

35
00:02:58,086 --> 00:03:02,249
A detail. The landscape is food.
Do you want to eat or not?

36
00:03:03,591 --> 00:03:06,758
If the nobles find out,
there'll be the devil to pay.

37
00:03:07,762 --> 00:03:09,719
Then pray that they don't.

38
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:51,648
Visor.

39
00:04:51,946 --> 00:04:53,440
Come on, we're late.

40
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:32,564
The score stands at three lances
to none in favor of Sir Ector.

41
00:05:33,361 --> 00:05:34,689
Lord Philip of Aragon.

42
00:05:35,196 --> 00:05:36,820
Stand ye ready?

43
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,154
Sir Ector. Stand ye ready?

44
00:05:43,245 --> 00:05:44,241
Ready?

45
00:05:44,538 --> 00:05:46,661
I tilted against Sir Ector many times.

46
00:05:46,874 --> 00:05:49,709
ln practice as his target.
You never struck him.

47
00:05:50,002 --> 00:05:53,501
-Badger me not with details.
-The landscape. Stay on the horse.

48
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:57,422
He needs 3 points.
He has to knock you off the horse.

49
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,918
I know how to score, Roland.

50
00:06:01,054 --> 00:06:03,545
I've waited my whole life
for this moment.

51
00:06:04,391 --> 00:06:06,929
For Sir Ector to shite himself
to death?

52
00:06:44,763 --> 00:06:47,254
Get it in the cradle. ln the cradle.

53
00:06:47,558 --> 00:06:48,838
Get it in the cradle!

54
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,908
William, are you alive?

55
00:07:12,207 --> 00:07:14,365
-We won! We won!
-Can you hear me?

56
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:18,744
Get off me! William, can you hear me?

57
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,084
We won!

58
00:07:21,382 --> 00:07:23,790
He's breathing. He's breathing!

59
00:07:25,428 --> 00:07:26,970
Sir Ector.

60
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,968
Sir Ector. Remove your helmet.

61
00:07:38,148 --> 00:07:43,143
My lord, the final blow of the lance
has bent it onto my head.

62
00:07:43,487 --> 00:07:45,479
He says the final blow of the--

63
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:49,821
I present your champion, my lord.

64
00:08:16,143 --> 00:08:17,341
Twenty.

65
00:08:17,645 --> 00:08:18,807
No, 10.

66
00:08:19,146 --> 00:08:21,518
-Fifteen.
-Done.

67
00:08:26,195 --> 00:08:27,855
Very good. Cheers.

68
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:35,411
Fifteen silver florins.
He didn't want that.

69
00:08:35,704 --> 00:08:37,412
That's five for William.

70
00:08:37,706 --> 00:08:41,869
Five for Wat. Five for Roland,
who's going home to England.

71
00:08:42,252 --> 00:08:45,621
Straight to the pub for me.
Eel pie, brie tart...

72
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,756
...tansy cakes with peppermint cream.

73
00:08:53,388 --> 00:08:54,716
We could do this.

74
00:08:54,931 --> 00:08:57,552
We've done it, boy.
That's silver in your hand.

75
00:08:58,393 --> 00:09:01,429
No, I mean, we can do this.
We can be champions.

76
00:09:05,566 --> 00:09:07,440
Give us your coins.

77
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:12,859
Give me your coins.

78
00:09:16,619 --> 00:09:18,576
Now, that's one for you.

79
00:09:18,912 --> 00:09:21,783
And one...for you.

80
00:09:22,124 --> 00:09:24,697
Which leaves 13.

81
00:09:25,127 --> 00:09:27,748
That's 13 for training
and outfitting.

82
00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:30,914
The tournament in Rouen is in a month.

83
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:33,458
We could split a bigger prize.

84
00:09:35,095 --> 00:09:38,629
In one month we'd be on our way
to glory and riches.

85
00:09:39,266 --> 00:09:44,390
Or lying in a ditch with Sir Ector.
William, I just want to go home.

86
00:09:44,604 --> 00:09:49,147
Tansy cakes. Dilled veal balls.
I'll take my five now.

87
00:09:55,823 --> 00:09:57,448
Oh, wait up.

88
00:09:57,909 --> 00:10:00,067
You're going the wrong way!

89
00:10:01,454 --> 00:10:02,829
You can't even joust.

90
00:10:03,122 --> 00:10:06,822
Most of it is the guts to take a blow.
Guts I have.

91
00:10:07,126 --> 00:10:10,459
And technique?
I have a month to learn that.

92
00:10:10,838 --> 00:10:13,792
And name a man better
with a sword than I am.

93
00:10:14,007 --> 00:10:17,590
-In the practice ring.
-You're not of noble birth.

94
00:10:17,803 --> 00:10:19,345
So, we lie.

95
00:10:19,638 --> 00:10:23,137
How did the nobles become noble
in the first place?

96
00:10:24,518 --> 00:10:28,136
They took it at the tip of a sword.
I'll do it with a lance.

97
00:10:28,522 --> 00:10:31,059
-A blunted lance.
-No matter, Wat.

98
00:10:31,316 --> 00:10:36,191
A man can change his stars. I won't
spend the rest of my life as nothing.

99
00:10:37,989 --> 00:10:41,192
That is nothing. And that's
where glory will take us.

100
00:10:41,534 --> 00:10:45,828
We're peasants. Glory and riches
are beyond our grasp.

101
00:10:46,122 --> 00:10:48,827
But a full stomach?
That dream can come true.

102
00:10:58,676 --> 00:11:02,045
If you can take your coins,
go eat cake in England.

103
00:11:02,346 --> 00:11:05,549
But if you can't, you come with me.

104
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,020
You see? Money doesn't matter.

105
00:11:28,204 --> 00:11:29,449
See how hungry I am?

106
00:11:29,873 --> 00:11:31,865
-Do you?
-Damn your stomach, Wat!

107
00:11:34,502 --> 00:11:35,877
Roland, please.

108
00:11:39,048 --> 00:11:42,915
With 1 3 silver pieces,
three men can change their stars.

109
00:11:51,727 --> 00:11:53,221
God love you, William.

110
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,846
I know, I know. No one else will.

111
00:12:09,744 --> 00:12:11,369
Unlucky.

112
00:12:12,414 --> 00:12:14,406
-I think he's getting worse.
-He is getting worse.

113
00:12:29,097 --> 00:12:30,259
Switch.

114
00:12:36,604 --> 00:12:37,979
Switch.

115
00:12:39,398 --> 00:12:41,438
Glory and riches. Glory and riches!

116
00:12:53,036 --> 00:12:54,614
You see how dangerous it is?

117
00:12:55,789 --> 00:12:59,454
Faster! Faster!
All right, use those legs!

118
00:13:00,127 --> 00:13:02,452
Come on, Roland. Faster! Faster!

119
00:13:05,298 --> 00:13:09,166
-You missed it.
-You've done it dozens of times.

120
00:13:09,511 --> 00:13:12,465
Well, I guess that means
we should do it again.

121
00:13:14,974 --> 00:13:16,137
Come on.

122
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:19,800
Come on, ponies.

123
00:13:20,146 --> 00:13:21,309
Fong him.

124
00:13:26,193 --> 00:13:28,020
Faster. Balance.

125
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,811
No, slower. Keep it steady.

126
00:13:34,577 --> 00:13:36,368
I got it! Look, I got it!

127
00:13:50,175 --> 00:13:51,634
Any minute now.

128
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,367
-Yes, better.
-Nice.

129
00:14:32,049 --> 00:14:34,456
-It's my turn to ride.
-No.

130
00:14:34,718 --> 00:14:37,387
We haven't reached the marker.
And you shouldn't.

131
00:14:38,013 --> 00:14:41,678
How would it look if my squire rode
while I walked?

132
00:14:42,017 --> 00:14:46,477
I don't give a witch's teat!
It's my turn! It's my turn!

133
00:14:46,813 --> 00:14:51,356
Maybe nobody should ride.
The horse is not what he used to be.

134
00:14:51,693 --> 00:14:54,148
Fine. Fine.

135
00:14:56,573 --> 00:14:57,687
Morning.

136
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,814
Morning.

137
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:01,488
Hoy, sir.

138
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:08,448
What are you doing?

139
00:15:09,126 --> 00:15:11,202
Uh...trudging.

140
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,748
You know, trudging? To trudge?

141
00:15:17,092 --> 00:15:19,465
To trudge the slow, weary...

142
00:15:19,803 --> 00:15:23,587
...depressing, yet determined walk
of a man who had nothing left...

143
00:15:23,891 --> 00:15:27,425
...except the impulse to simply
soldier on.

144
00:15:27,936 --> 00:15:29,561
Were you robbed?

145
00:15:30,105 --> 00:15:32,774
Interesting question. Yes.

146
00:15:33,025 --> 00:15:35,776
And at the same time,
a huge, resounding, '' No.''

147
00:15:36,153 --> 00:15:40,316
It's more a sort of involuntary
vow of poverty, really.

148
00:15:40,615 --> 00:15:44,114
But on the brighter side,
trudging does represent pride.

149
00:15:44,494 --> 00:15:48,112
Pride, resolve and faith
in the good Lord Almighty.

150
00:15:48,456 --> 00:15:51,161
Please, Christ, rescue me
from my current...

151
00:15:52,627 --> 00:15:54,287
...tribulations.

152
00:15:55,797 --> 00:15:57,374
Who are you?

153
00:15:59,967 --> 00:16:01,794
Lilium inter spinas.

154
00:16:02,511 --> 00:16:04,338
The lily among the thorns.

155
00:16:04,638 --> 00:16:07,308
Geoffrey Chaucer's the name.
Writing's the game.

156
00:16:14,231 --> 00:16:15,559
Chaucer?

157
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:18,566
Geoffrey Chaucer, the writer?

158
00:16:22,572 --> 00:16:25,242
-A what?
-''A what?'' A writer.

159
00:16:25,575 --> 00:16:30,570
I write with ink and parchment.
For a penny, I'll scribble anything.

160
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:35,243
Summonses, decrees, edicts,
warrants, patents of nobility.

161
00:16:36,002 --> 00:16:39,252
I've been known to jot down
a poem, if the muse descends.

162
00:16:39,506 --> 00:16:42,506
You probably read my book,
The Book of the Duchess.

163
00:16:45,595 --> 00:16:47,137
Well, it was allegorical.

164
00:16:47,513 --> 00:16:51,345
We won't hold it against you.
Each man decides that for himself.

165
00:16:52,602 --> 00:16:54,677
Did you say patents of nobility?

166
00:16:57,273 --> 00:16:58,850
That's right. I did.

167
00:17:02,194 --> 00:17:03,937
And you gentlemen are?

168
00:17:05,531 --> 00:17:08,697
I am Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein
from Gelderland.

169
00:17:09,618 --> 00:17:14,494
These are my faithful squires,
Delves of Dodgington...

170
00:17:15,165 --> 00:17:18,035
...and Fowlehurst of Crewe.

171
00:17:19,127 --> 00:17:21,499
I'm Richard the Lionheart.
A pleasure.

172
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:24,080
No, I'm Charlemagne!
John the Baptist!

173
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:25,674
All right!

174
00:17:26,468 --> 00:17:28,626
Hold your tongue, sir, or lose it.

175
00:17:30,471 --> 00:17:33,472
Now you see that, I do believe...

176
00:17:33,975 --> 00:17:35,303
...Sir Ulrich.

177
00:17:36,811 --> 00:17:39,598
Thank you, Geoff.

178
00:17:41,566 --> 00:17:46,062
Have you any more to say, Master Nude,
or may we be on our way?

179
00:17:46,987 --> 00:17:49,988
-Off to the tournament?
-This is the road to Rouen.

180
00:17:50,616 --> 00:17:55,112
That remains to be seen.
They're limiting the field at Rouen.

181
00:17:55,663 --> 00:18:00,657
Noble birth must be established
for four generations on either side.

182
00:18:01,293 --> 00:18:04,294
Patents of nobility must be provided.

183
00:18:13,722 --> 00:18:15,513
Listen, clothe me...

184
00:18:16,516 --> 00:18:20,514
...shoe me, for God's sake, feed me
and you'll have your patents.

185
00:18:22,021 --> 00:18:23,219
No.

186
00:18:23,856 --> 00:18:27,521
-Patents of nobility.
-We need him. We need him.

187
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:30,775
-Let me handle it.
-Be nice.

188
00:18:35,368 --> 00:18:37,360
Nice, nice, nice.

189
00:18:38,371 --> 00:18:39,746
All right.

190
00:18:41,373 --> 00:18:45,703
Betray us and I will fong you
until your insides are out...

191
00:18:46,045 --> 00:18:50,706
...your outsides are in and your
entrails are your extrails.

192
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,960
Pain.

193
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:01,058
Lots of pain.

194
00:19:10,735 --> 00:19:15,112
I present Sir Ulrich, whose mother's
father was Shilhard von Rechberg...

195
00:19:15,365 --> 00:19:20,157
...son of the Duke Guelph of Saxony,
son of Ghibellines, son of Wendish.

196
00:19:20,453 --> 00:19:23,489
-Wendish inherited the fief--
-That'll do, herald.

197
00:19:23,748 --> 00:19:27,615
Six generations is more than enough.
Show me the patents.

198
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:41,382
lndicate in which events
shall your Lord Ulrich compete.

199
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:48,102
He'll first meet Roger Lord Mortimer.

200
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,437
Thank you very much.

201
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:03,619
I can't believe it.
You did it, Chaucer.

202
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,740
I thank you. I didn't think
we had a chance.

203
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:12,501
My pleasure, William.

204
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:15,120
If you don't mind, I'll stick around.

205
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:18,002
Be my herald, you'll
get part of the winnings.

206
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:22,506
Done. Now if you don't mind,
I have to see a man about a dog.

207
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,685
Walking out from Cheapside

208
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:32,016
My fortunes for to seek

209
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,400
I passed along the River Thames

210
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:38,729
It's waters did they reek

211
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:43,106
'Twas there I met a pretty lass

212
00:20:43,366 --> 00:20:46,367
She said her name was Nell

213
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,210
Bell or hell rhymes with Nell.

214
00:21:58,814 --> 00:22:00,273
Would you speak to me?

215
00:22:01,442 --> 00:22:03,482
Ah, to speak.

216
00:22:05,321 --> 00:22:08,440
Sir, my sex are marked
by their silence.

217
00:22:08,782 --> 00:22:11,487
I would hear you speak
if it cost me my ears.

218
00:22:11,785 --> 00:22:14,822
That is well, for I do not
want silence in my life.

219
00:22:15,205 --> 00:22:16,997
Tell me your name.

220
00:22:20,252 --> 00:22:22,743
-Would you care if I were ugly?
-Yes!

221
00:22:24,006 --> 00:22:26,164
I mean, no. I mean--

222
00:22:26,466 --> 00:22:29,337
You desecrate the house of God!

223
00:22:44,901 --> 00:22:46,063
Tell me your name.

224
00:22:47,028 --> 00:22:50,361
And what would you do
with my name, Sir Hunter?

225
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:53,659
Call me a fox, for
that is all I am to you.

226
00:22:55,202 --> 00:22:59,663
Then a fox you shall be until
I find your name, my foxy lady.

227
00:23:04,878 --> 00:23:07,334
He's a handsome hunter.
I give him that.

228
00:23:07,673 --> 00:23:10,342
Does this not shock you, ladies?

229
00:23:12,594 --> 00:23:13,875
Certainly, my lord.

230
00:23:14,888 --> 00:23:18,506
I only laugh just
to keep from weeping.

231
00:23:21,561 --> 00:23:22,842
Beauty is such a curse.

232
00:23:24,439 --> 00:23:26,313
Pray your years come swiftly.

233
00:23:26,649 --> 00:23:29,603
Pray your beauty fades
so you may better serve God.

234
00:23:30,653 --> 00:23:33,939
Oh, I do, my lord. I pray for it all
the time.

235
00:23:35,617 --> 00:23:38,701
Why, God, did you curse me
with this face?

236
00:23:39,912 --> 00:23:43,862
God's will has a purpose,
but we may not know it.

237
00:23:47,628 --> 00:23:49,786
Well, that is lovely.

238
00:24:20,535 --> 00:24:23,820
Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein...

239
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:29,502
...defeats Roger Lord Mortimer
one lance to none.

240
00:24:31,921 --> 00:24:34,922
Easy. They'll think l
never broke a lance before.

241
00:24:35,216 --> 00:24:39,628
-But you haven't!
-Ulrich's broken thousands of lances.

242
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:42,716
Come on. You're due
in the sword ring.

243
00:24:43,057 --> 00:24:44,765
My armor's loose.

244
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,642
Shite. I can't block an overhead.

245
00:24:55,903 --> 00:24:59,521
We can't fix it now.
We're overdue in the sword ring.

246
00:25:00,657 --> 00:25:04,073
It was a mistake to do two events.
I'm too hurried.

247
00:25:04,411 --> 00:25:07,910
-I'll withdraw from the sword.
-Sword's what you're best at.

248
00:25:08,248 --> 00:25:11,617
But the prizes and prestige
are bigger in the joust.

249
00:25:11,918 --> 00:25:15,085
Ulrich von Lichtenstein?
I am Simon the Summoner.

250
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:18,372
I'm overdue at the sword ring.

251
00:25:19,592 --> 00:25:22,593
I must detain you
on behalf of your herald.

252
00:25:23,471 --> 00:25:25,095
You were never robbed.

253
00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:30,515
I have a gambling problem.

254
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:33,436
I can't help myself.

255
00:25:33,773 --> 00:25:36,643
And these people will...

256
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:40,230
...literally take the clothes
off your back.

257
00:25:41,613 --> 00:25:43,606
What are we supposed to do?

258
00:25:43,866 --> 00:25:48,326
He assured us that you,
his liege, would pay us.

259
00:25:52,624 --> 00:25:53,952
And who are you?

260
00:25:54,459 --> 00:25:57,294
Peter, a humble pardoner...

261
00:25:57,671 --> 00:26:00,043
...and purveyor of religious relics.

262
00:26:01,758 --> 00:26:02,921
How much does he owe?

263
00:26:03,468 --> 00:26:06,041
Ten gold florins.

264
00:26:07,305 --> 00:26:09,048
You manky git!

265
00:26:10,808 --> 00:26:13,513
-Pain! Pain! Take the pain!
-Get him off me!

266
00:26:13,811 --> 00:26:15,603
Wat, let him go!

267
00:26:25,698 --> 00:26:28,864
What would you do to him
if I was to refuse?

268
00:26:30,869 --> 00:26:34,036
We, on behalf of the Lord God...

269
00:26:34,373 --> 00:26:38,999
...will take it from his flesh
so that he may understand...

270
00:26:39,253 --> 00:26:41,708
...that gambling is a sin.

271
00:26:45,342 --> 00:26:46,717
Oh, come on.

272
00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:49,047
Please, Will.

273
00:26:52,515 --> 00:26:55,350
Please, will you help me,
Sir Ulrich?

274
00:26:57,061 --> 00:26:59,184
I promise you won't regret it.

275
00:27:01,691 --> 00:27:03,600
I don't have the money.

276
00:27:09,031 --> 00:27:10,573
Release him...

277
00:27:11,367 --> 00:27:14,036
...and give him back his clothes.

278
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,573
And you'll get it.

279
00:27:18,123 --> 00:27:19,072
Done.

280
00:27:23,796 --> 00:27:24,709
You lied.

281
00:27:25,089 --> 00:27:29,750
Yes, I lied. I'm a writer.
I give the truth scope!

282
00:27:30,219 --> 00:27:34,050
Behold my Lord
Ulrich von Lichtenstein, son of--

283
00:27:34,389 --> 00:27:36,927
-Too late. He's been announced.
-Fine.

284
00:27:37,225 --> 00:27:40,808
Ten blows by sword.
Sir Ulrich to receive first.

285
00:27:47,735 --> 00:27:48,731
Strike!

286
00:27:57,703 --> 00:27:58,818
Strike!

287
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:00,413
Stop letting him hit you!

288
00:28:00,623 --> 00:28:02,615
Shut up! Shut up!

289
00:28:04,085 --> 00:28:07,251
Two strikes for Sir Walter Loring!

290
00:28:07,588 --> 00:28:09,746
Sir Ulrich to strike!

291
00:28:10,549 --> 00:28:12,293
-Now it's your turn!
-Come on!

292
00:28:25,814 --> 00:28:27,142
Strike!

293
00:28:29,484 --> 00:28:31,144
I taught him that!
That's me!

294
00:28:31,945 --> 00:28:35,148
Sir Ulrich prevails,
five strikes to two!

295
00:28:36,783 --> 00:28:37,898
Yes!

296
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,951
Behold my Lord Ulrich!
The rock! The hard place!

297
00:28:43,164 --> 00:28:46,118
Like a wind from Gelderland,
he sweeps by!

298
00:28:46,501 --> 00:28:50,450
Blown far from his homeland
in search of glory and honor!

299
00:28:50,796 --> 00:28:55,174
We walk in the garden
of his turbulence!

300
00:29:02,141 --> 00:29:03,765
Yeah!

301
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,766
-You're champion.
-Of the sword.

302
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:35,262
lsn't that why we're here? Come on.

303
00:30:35,481 --> 00:30:38,897
Do you want to touch him?
Do you want to touch him?

304
00:30:54,791 --> 00:30:57,199
We should've saved
for the blacksmith.

305
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,795
I can't pay you now...

306
00:31:00,005 --> 00:31:03,587
-...but I promise I will, just as..
-No! Money.

307
00:31:07,429 --> 00:31:11,592
-Excuse me.
-Cash first, not promises.

308
00:31:12,267 --> 00:31:13,891
Go on.

309
00:31:15,979 --> 00:31:17,639
Excuse me, sir.

310
00:31:18,648 --> 00:31:20,937
You might try the farris.

311
00:31:22,276 --> 00:31:23,605
A woman?

312
00:31:23,986 --> 00:31:26,987
Beggars cannot be choosers, my lord.

313
00:31:29,784 --> 00:31:31,159
Thank you.

314
00:31:32,495 --> 00:31:35,412
-Excuse me.
-I don't work for free.

315
00:31:35,623 --> 00:31:39,834
-I can't joust with broken armor.
-That's your problem, not mine.

316
00:31:40,794 --> 00:31:43,748
Each drop of this sweat
has a price on it.

317
00:31:46,633 --> 00:31:50,002
Just as well. They told me
I was daft to even ask.

318
00:31:51,096 --> 00:31:54,132
-Who?
-The other armorers.

319
00:31:57,435 --> 00:32:00,223
Did they say I couldn't do it
because I'm a woman?

320
00:32:00,981 --> 00:32:03,768
They said you're good
with horseshoes, not armor.

321
00:32:04,025 --> 00:32:06,397
No one mentioned you being a woman.

322
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:12,150
Cat's meat! Hot wine!

323
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:14,651
Cat's meat! Hot wine!

324
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:34,046
Lady, I will win
this tournament for you.

325
00:32:34,263 --> 00:32:36,255
Nay! I will win for you.

326
00:32:36,515 --> 00:32:38,258
May I present Count Adhemar...

327
00:32:38,475 --> 00:32:42,342
...winner of the joust in France
and champion at Saint-Emilion.

328
00:32:45,023 --> 00:32:50,018
All forgotten when standing before the
most beautiful woman in Christendom.

329
00:32:55,366 --> 00:33:00,361
Do you only pretend to fight, Count
Adhemar, or wage real war as well?

330
00:33:01,372 --> 00:33:06,200
I am leader of the free companies.
My army is in southern France.

331
00:33:08,546 --> 00:33:11,251
Geoff, 'tis my lady.

332
00:33:11,882 --> 00:33:16,046
-William, you aim too high.
-I don't know any other way to aim.

333
00:33:16,387 --> 00:33:19,590
-Concentrate.
-What should I say to her?

334
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:29,933
What do you think of the joust?

335
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:32,436
It's very abrupt.

336
00:33:33,153 --> 00:33:35,609
And I don't understand the rules.

337
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:38,281
Then I shall educate you.

338
00:33:39,284 --> 00:33:42,119
A match is three lances.

339
00:33:43,288 --> 00:33:48,080
One point is given for breaking
a lance between the waist and neck.

340
00:33:48,293 --> 00:33:51,459
Two points for breaking on the helmet.
It's difficult.

341
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:55,794
The helmet sweeps back.
Most blows glance off.

342
00:33:56,175 --> 00:33:59,710
Three points for bearing a rider
to the ground.

343
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:03,304
Also, if you bear a rider
to the ground, you win his horse.

344
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:05,967
Do men die in the joust?

345
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:09,761
Lance points are tipped
with coronals, which blunts them.

346
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:13,149
Of course, accidents happen.

347
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:17,522
I myself, Jocelyn,
have never been unhorsed.

348
00:34:18,655 --> 00:34:20,315
Nor have I.

349
00:34:23,076 --> 00:34:24,405
Your name, lady.

350
00:34:24,911 --> 00:34:26,785
I still need to hear it.

351
00:34:27,664 --> 00:34:29,906
Sir Hunter, you persist.

352
00:34:30,333 --> 00:34:34,034
Perhaps angels have no names.
Only beautiful faces.

353
00:34:37,424 --> 00:34:38,752
And you are?

354
00:34:40,051 --> 00:34:41,332
I am, um....

355
00:34:41,594 --> 00:34:42,875
Have you forgotten?

356
00:34:43,137 --> 00:34:45,011
Or your name is Sir '' Um.''

357
00:34:46,516 --> 00:34:49,682
Ulrich von Lichtenstein
from Gelderland.

358
00:34:50,019 --> 00:34:52,557
I'd forget as well. What a mouthful.

359
00:34:53,272 --> 00:34:55,942
-Your armor, sir.
-What about it?

360
00:34:56,359 --> 00:35:01,186
How stylish of you to wear an antique.
You'll start a new fashion if you win.

361
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:04,899
My grandfather will be able
to wear his in public again.

362
00:35:05,534 --> 00:35:08,369
And a shield. How quaint.

363
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:23,125
Some of these poor country knights,
little better than peasants.

364
00:35:24,261 --> 00:35:25,755
--the second son...

365
00:35:26,096 --> 00:35:29,714
...of Sir Wallace Percival,
third Earl of Warwick.

366
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,721
My lords, my ladies...

367
00:35:32,936 --> 00:35:36,554
...it is with honor
I introduce my liege...

368
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,064
...Sir Thomas Colville.

369
00:35:46,407 --> 00:35:47,901
You're good.

370
00:35:49,076 --> 00:35:50,570
You're very good.

371
00:35:51,954 --> 00:35:53,413
My lords...

372
00:35:54,123 --> 00:35:55,617
...my ladies...

373
00:35:59,294 --> 00:36:02,959
...and everybody else here
not sitting on a cushion...

374
00:36:10,097 --> 00:36:11,757
...today...

375
00:36:13,433 --> 00:36:15,509
...you find yourselves equals.

376
00:36:23,151 --> 00:36:26,602
For you are all equally blessed.

377
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:30,106
For I have the pride...

378
00:36:30,992 --> 00:36:33,280
...the privilege, nay, the pleasure...

379
00:36:34,287 --> 00:36:38,616
...of introducing to you
a knight sired by knights.

380
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,368
A knight who can trace
his lineage back...

381
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:45,293
...beyond Charlemagne.

382
00:36:47,341 --> 00:36:49,084
I first met him...

383
00:36:49,343 --> 00:36:51,549
...atop a mountain near Jerusalem...

384
00:36:51,845 --> 00:36:53,968
...praying to God...

385
00:36:54,473 --> 00:36:57,806
...asking his forgiveness
for the Saracen blood...

386
00:36:58,143 --> 00:37:00,052
...spilt by his sword.

387
00:37:00,312 --> 00:37:03,432
Next, he amazed me
still further in ltaly...

388
00:37:03,648 --> 00:37:05,855
...when he saved a fatherless
beauty...

389
00:37:06,109 --> 00:37:09,727
...from the would-be ravishings
of her dreadful uncle.

390
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:18,995
In Greece...

391
00:37:19,831 --> 00:37:22,701
...he spent a year in silence...

392
00:37:24,502 --> 00:37:27,669
...just to better understand
the sound...

393
00:37:30,216 --> 00:37:31,840
...of a whisper.

394
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:42,008
So without further gilding the lily
and with no more ado...

395
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:45,016
...I give to you
the Seeker of Serenity...

396
00:37:45,355 --> 00:37:48,025
...Protector of Italian Virginity...

397
00:37:48,358 --> 00:37:53,186
...the Enforcer of our Lord God,
the one, the only...

398
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:57,528
...Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein!

399
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:14,040
Thank you! Thank you!
I'll be here all week.

400
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:22,385
That was different.

401
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,758
It's time we celebrated
our differences.

402
00:38:24,977 --> 00:38:26,970
Just maybe not in public.

403
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,059
You....

404
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,058
Yes, I'm well aware
a good fonging is on the way.

405
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:35,235
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

406
00:38:35,612 --> 00:38:38,697
I got their attention.
You win their hearts.

407
00:38:59,928 --> 00:39:01,256
Very good.

408
00:39:01,638 --> 00:39:03,429
-Was she watching? Geoff.
-What?

409
00:39:03,806 --> 00:39:05,799
-Did she see me?
-Yes, she did.

410
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,259
-Did she see me take the hit?
-Yes.

411
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:11,520
-Was she concerned?
-Her eyes welled up. Just awful.

412
00:39:26,453 --> 00:39:30,285
Colville has perfect technique.
I've never seen him before.

413
00:39:30,624 --> 00:39:31,952
Nor I.

414
00:39:32,292 --> 00:39:34,201
But this Lichtenstein.

415
00:39:34,503 --> 00:39:37,587
His technique, rudimentary.
Style, nonexistent.

416
00:39:37,798 --> 00:39:40,335
Still, he's fearless.

417
00:39:41,635 --> 00:39:43,674
Fearless? How so?

418
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:47,838
The slit in the visor is narrow,
but splinters can penetrate it.

419
00:39:48,058 --> 00:39:51,094
Most knights raise their chins
at the last instant.

420
00:39:51,311 --> 00:39:56,305
You lose sight of your opponent, but
protect your eyes. Ulrich doesn't.

421
00:39:57,025 --> 00:39:59,183
He keeps his eye on the target.

422
00:40:00,361 --> 00:40:01,986
A true hunter.

423
00:40:11,997 --> 00:40:13,539
Sir Ulrich...

424
00:40:15,334 --> 00:40:16,330
...I'm through.

425
00:40:17,503 --> 00:40:20,872
But I've never not finished before.

426
00:40:21,673 --> 00:40:25,208
I wish to keep my honor intact.

427
00:40:50,576 --> 00:40:52,865
A draw. And Colville is hurt.

428
00:41:01,587 --> 00:41:05,205
Colville withdraws. Ulrich advances.

429
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:08,377
Why didn't Ulrich finish him?

430
00:41:09,094 --> 00:41:10,921
He shows mercy.

431
00:41:12,723 --> 00:41:16,886
Then he shows his weakness.
That's all mercy is.

432
00:41:21,648 --> 00:41:24,732
For the love of victory, William,
go to sleep.

433
00:41:27,946 --> 00:41:29,226
I can't.

434
00:41:31,408 --> 00:41:34,408
Love has given me wings,
so I must fly.

435
00:41:37,121 --> 00:41:38,829
I can't explain it.

436
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:44,450
-She makes me feel like a poet.
-You may feel like a poet...

437
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,330
...but you sound like an idiot.

438
00:41:46,547 --> 00:41:49,465
-You don't even know her name.
-Her name?

439
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,632
Her name is Aphrodite.

440
00:41:54,096 --> 00:41:57,595
Calypso. Venus. Take your pick.

441
00:42:02,271 --> 00:42:04,643
Women weaken the heart.

442
00:42:06,149 --> 00:42:08,771
Without your heart, you cannot win.

443
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:14,857
-But her eyes--
-Concentrate.

444
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:16,659
Tansy cakes!

445
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:21,826
Count Adhemar sends word.

446
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:26,284
He said he will win
this tournament for you.

447
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:31,333
He's won many. He wins them
for himself and his own honor.

448
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,957
It's nothing to say
he wins them for me.

449
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,128
He wishes to speak to you again.

450
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,757
Not to hear a word I say.

451
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:44,390
Adhemar wants his women silent.

452
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:53,400
Would you have Sir Ulrich
win the tournament for you?

453
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:54,982
No.

454
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:59,483
And he is the only knight
who has not promised to do so.

455
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:04,033
Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

456
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:07,322
I would have him win my heart.

457
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:19,675
Adhemar! Adhemar! Adhemar!

458
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:25,510
Oh, lovely.

459
00:43:26,561 --> 00:43:30,060
I don't think I've ever seen
Count Adhemar lose.

460
00:43:30,523 --> 00:43:33,524
No, but defeat him
and you'll see it firsthand.

461
00:43:35,194 --> 00:43:36,688
My liege.

462
00:43:38,364 --> 00:43:39,858
Sir Ulrich.

463
00:43:41,867 --> 00:43:43,242
Christiana.

464
00:43:43,869 --> 00:43:47,867
-My lady bids you wear this token.
-Of course.

465
00:43:48,582 --> 00:43:51,203
She also said to tell you, her name...

466
00:43:53,211 --> 00:43:55,038
...is Jocelyn.

467
00:43:57,799 --> 00:43:59,293
-Au revoir.
-Au revoir.

468
00:44:01,177 --> 00:44:02,458
Oh, Jocelyn.

469
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:07,550
Concentrate.

470
00:45:30,139 --> 00:45:31,633
I can't breathe.

471
00:45:39,481 --> 00:45:41,355
No style whatsoever.

472
00:45:42,817 --> 00:45:44,644
But neither has an anvil.

473
00:45:45,654 --> 00:45:49,983
-He hits like a hammer. Amazing.
-But not perfect. He aims high.

474
00:45:50,241 --> 00:45:52,993
Roll your shoulder back,
his blow may go right.

475
00:45:53,244 --> 00:45:56,245
But if he strikes to my left,
I'll be obliterated.

476
00:45:56,789 --> 00:45:58,581
I didn't say it wasn't a gamble.

477
00:46:39,205 --> 00:46:42,906
Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich!

478
00:47:34,425 --> 00:47:35,754
William?

479
00:47:43,601 --> 00:47:45,095
William, here.

480
00:47:46,604 --> 00:47:47,932
Come here.

481
00:47:56,989 --> 00:47:59,444
Someday I'll be a knight.

482
00:48:00,993 --> 00:48:03,282
A thatcher's son? A knight?

483
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:06,455
You might as well try
to change the stars.

484
00:48:08,333 --> 00:48:10,160
Can it be done, Father?

485
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:13,960
-Can a man change the stars?
-Yes, William.

486
00:48:14,256 --> 00:48:17,210
If he believes enough,
a man can do anything.

487
00:48:36,986 --> 00:48:38,361
Come here.

488
00:48:45,828 --> 00:48:48,319
Gain more bearing, Ulrich.

489
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:51,032
See me again when you're worthy.

490
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:58,207
I'll fong you in the arse!

491
00:48:59,508 --> 00:49:02,213
Well done, my lord! Well done.

492
00:49:02,511 --> 00:49:04,799
-You bastard!
-Go and see to Ulrich.

493
00:49:05,013 --> 00:49:06,840
Go see to Ulrich.

494
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,185
Well done, my lord.

495
00:49:12,729 --> 00:49:14,353
A noble victory.

496
00:49:19,527 --> 00:49:23,062
My lady, I believe this is yours.

497
00:49:29,412 --> 00:49:32,033
For long spear on foot...

498
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:34,906
...Pandolfo Malatesta.

499
00:49:40,047 --> 00:49:44,424
For sword on foot,
Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

500
00:49:49,097 --> 00:49:53,890
Finally, for the mounted joust
and tournament champion...

501
00:49:54,227 --> 00:49:57,062
...Adhemar, Count of Anjou.

502
00:49:58,732 --> 00:50:01,602
Adhemar! Adhemar! Adhemar!

503
00:50:04,237 --> 00:50:08,282
I present to you your champions.

504
00:50:13,121 --> 00:50:17,747
Next time, you will look up
at me from the flat of your back.

505
00:50:17,959 --> 00:50:22,003
Please. You have been weighed,
you have been measured...

506
00:50:22,255 --> 00:50:24,247
...and you have been found wanting.

507
00:50:32,264 --> 00:50:34,221
Keep winning the sword.

508
00:50:34,475 --> 00:50:36,847
-I won't compete in it.
-It's your best.

509
00:50:37,144 --> 00:50:39,765
No. It's tournament champion
or nothing at all.

510
00:50:45,277 --> 00:50:47,815
Ten florins. That should do.

511
00:50:50,657 --> 00:50:54,275
Sixes and sevens tonight, Chaucer.
Do you feel lucky?

512
00:50:54,619 --> 00:50:58,783
-Have you enough clothes?
-Be gone. I'm done with you.

513
00:50:59,624 --> 00:51:02,162
Except to exact my revenge.

514
00:51:04,629 --> 00:51:08,128
What on earth could you
possibly do to us?

515
00:51:08,508 --> 00:51:10,796
I will eviscerate you in fiction.

516
00:51:11,135 --> 00:51:14,469
Every last pimple,
every last character flaw.

517
00:51:14,847 --> 00:51:19,176
I was naked for a day.
You will be naked for eternity.

518
00:51:19,977 --> 00:51:22,468
I have a feeling we shall meet again.

519
00:51:25,316 --> 00:51:27,985
Here, farris, take what we owe you.

520
00:51:28,986 --> 00:51:33,149
The armor you wear, it wasn't
made for you, was it?

521
00:51:34,241 --> 00:51:35,700
So, what of it?

522
00:51:35,867 --> 00:51:38,821
I could make armor you wouldn't
even know you wore it.

523
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:40,407
What's the cost?

524
00:51:41,998 --> 00:51:44,205
Just take me as far as Paris.

525
00:51:45,252 --> 00:51:48,122
We travel alone.
Take your gold and go.

526
00:51:56,554 --> 00:52:01,015
-Get what you can. Let's pack.
-Why are we leaving so soon?

527
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:06,345
The next tournament is in a week.
We can walk now and save the horse.

528
00:52:06,731 --> 00:52:10,100
You must go to the banquet.
You'll dance and make an appearance.

529
00:52:10,359 --> 00:52:12,518
Let Adhemar laugh at me again?
No!

530
00:52:12,778 --> 00:52:14,771
-Yes!
-No!

531
00:52:21,036 --> 00:52:24,571
My lady would know the color
of your lord's tunic tonight.

532
00:52:25,207 --> 00:52:29,370
-His tunic?
-Yes, so she can dress to match him.

533
00:52:29,753 --> 00:52:33,288
We regret to inform your lady
he won't be attending--

534
00:52:33,548 --> 00:52:37,083
-Herald, do not give my answers!
-Yes, my lord.

535
00:52:37,302 --> 00:52:38,879
Squire, answer her.

536
00:52:39,262 --> 00:52:42,880
What color is my tunic tonight?

537
00:52:47,061 --> 00:52:48,437
Green.

538
00:52:50,606 --> 00:52:52,314
Trimmed in a kind of...

539
00:52:52,608 --> 00:52:54,400
...pale green...

540
00:52:56,237 --> 00:52:57,565
...with...

541
00:52:57,947 --> 00:53:00,070
...uh, wooden toggles.

542
00:53:01,742 --> 00:53:03,569
I will tell my lady.

543
00:53:10,084 --> 00:53:13,867
-This is a disaster!
-No, it'll tunic up quite nicely.

544
00:53:14,087 --> 00:53:16,080
That's not a disaster, Roland.

545
00:53:19,968 --> 00:53:21,593
I don't know how to dance.

546
00:53:24,097 --> 00:53:27,762
And one and two and three and four.

547
00:53:28,143 --> 00:53:31,428
Your hand should be light,
like a birdie on a branch.

548
00:53:31,771 --> 00:53:35,270
And one, two and three and four.

549
00:53:35,608 --> 00:53:38,775
And Wat doesn't lead,
he follows like a girl.

550
00:53:48,788 --> 00:53:51,954
And one and two and...

551
00:53:52,333 --> 00:53:53,957
...twirly, twirly, twirly.

552
00:53:54,335 --> 00:53:57,454
And one and two, and you're
still getting it wrong.

553
00:53:57,796 --> 00:54:01,497
And one and two
and three and four.

554
00:54:01,842 --> 00:54:05,128
You can hit me all day
because you punch like a what?

555
00:54:05,387 --> 00:54:06,668
A girl.

556
00:54:06,972 --> 00:54:08,965
-Enough!
-Get back! Wat, quiet!

557
00:54:09,516 --> 00:54:11,473
-He starts it.
-You know he's touchy!

558
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:16,013
Oh, and you can do better?

559
00:54:16,481 --> 00:54:19,352
-Of course.
-Then show us.

560
00:54:20,443 --> 00:54:21,985
No.

561
00:54:23,655 --> 00:54:28,233
If I'm making all this effort,
you'd best ask her nicely.

562
00:54:32,830 --> 00:54:33,945
I'm sorry, Kate.

563
00:54:38,169 --> 00:54:42,166
I was wondering if you'd care
to show us how to dance.

564
00:54:43,299 --> 00:54:44,461
-Please.
-Please.

565
00:54:47,845 --> 00:54:51,344
And one and two, three and four.

566
00:54:51,724 --> 00:54:54,724
Five, six, seven, change partners.

567
00:54:55,019 --> 00:54:58,352
And one, two, three, four...

568
00:54:58,689 --> 00:55:01,144
...five, six, seven.

569
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:03,226
Polonaise. And one....

570
00:55:04,111 --> 00:55:06,518
Are you wearing your hair like that?

571
00:55:07,614 --> 00:55:09,357
Is there another way?

572
00:55:38,436 --> 00:55:42,385
Sir Ulrich, you look fantastic.

573
00:55:45,401 --> 00:55:47,523
Jocelyn, you look....

574
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:51,442
Uh, you...

575
00:55:54,868 --> 00:55:56,362
...remind me of the Bible.

576
00:56:02,042 --> 00:56:06,419
When God stopped the sun to give
Joshua time to defeat the Amorites.

577
00:56:10,091 --> 00:56:11,420
I don't understand.

578
00:56:16,431 --> 00:56:19,135
If I could ask God one thing...

579
00:56:19,767 --> 00:56:22,056
...it would be to stop the moon.

580
00:56:23,938 --> 00:56:26,808
Stop the moon and make this night...

581
00:56:28,109 --> 00:56:29,769
...and your beauty...

582
00:56:30,444 --> 00:56:32,152
...last forever.

583
00:56:34,281 --> 00:56:37,615
What dance will you have? A coranto?

584
00:56:38,619 --> 00:56:40,611
Or a basse dance?

585
00:56:41,622 --> 00:56:43,164
Sir Ulrich.

586
00:56:44,958 --> 00:56:48,078
Why don't you show us a dance
of your country?

587
00:56:48,837 --> 00:56:51,126
Show us a dance of Gelderland.

588
00:56:53,133 --> 00:56:55,291
Yes. Gelderland.

589
00:56:59,472 --> 00:57:02,307
Well, it's a lot like the farandole...

590
00:57:03,643 --> 00:57:06,478
...but with some differences.

591
00:57:07,647 --> 00:57:09,639
Well, you bow.

592
00:57:13,986 --> 00:57:15,528
And...

593
00:57:27,666 --> 00:57:28,829
...and....

594
00:57:42,889 --> 00:57:45,012
Places. Places.

595
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:55,862
What?

596
01:00:57,202 --> 01:01:02,541
-I don't know. Too small, too light.
-He'll be crushed. Killed.

597
01:01:02,874 --> 01:01:07,501
No. I found a new way to heat steel.
It's thinner, smaller...

598
01:01:07,712 --> 01:01:09,372
...but just as strong.

599
01:01:09,673 --> 01:01:10,835
What are these?

600
01:01:11,216 --> 01:01:14,881
The marks of my trade should
another knight admire the armor.

601
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:20,716
Twist and bend. Feel the movement.

602
01:01:22,352 --> 01:01:25,721
-But eventually I will be struck.
-And then death.

603
01:01:26,397 --> 01:01:29,102
Do you at least have the courage
to test it?

604
01:01:38,534 --> 01:01:39,530
You okay?

605
01:01:41,078 --> 01:01:42,738
I didn't feel a thing.

606
01:02:09,814 --> 01:02:12,768
-Who's that knight?
-Piers Courtenay.

607
01:02:13,067 --> 01:02:17,279
He's raised taxes on his land 3 times
this year to pay for tournament.

608
01:02:17,488 --> 01:02:20,323
His people starve while
he sits at banquet.

609
01:02:24,036 --> 01:02:25,744
It's probably true.

610
01:02:59,821 --> 01:03:03,106
Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich!

611
01:03:03,658 --> 01:03:06,279
Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

612
01:03:07,704 --> 01:03:09,281
The Count Adhemar...

613
01:03:09,956 --> 01:03:11,995
...son of Philippe de Vitry...

614
01:03:12,333 --> 01:03:14,491
...son of Gilles...

615
01:03:15,461 --> 01:03:16,955
...master of the free companies...

616
01:03:17,546 --> 01:03:20,417
...defender of his enormous manhood...

617
01:03:21,133 --> 01:03:23,671
...a shining example of chivalry...

618
01:03:23,969 --> 01:03:25,843
...and champagne.

619
01:03:30,309 --> 01:03:31,851
Nice work!

620
01:03:33,312 --> 01:03:34,640
Bravo!

621
01:03:38,108 --> 01:03:41,275
Watch every move Adhemar makes.
We'll find a weakness.

622
01:03:41,486 --> 01:03:43,146
Well, Colville looks fit.

623
01:03:43,488 --> 01:03:44,651
--my liege...

624
01:03:44,865 --> 01:03:47,652
...the second son of
Sir Wallace Percival.

625
01:03:47,867 --> 01:03:50,655
It is my deepest honor--

626
01:03:54,165 --> 01:03:56,407
My deepest honor to present to you....

627
01:03:57,210 --> 01:04:00,164
It's Edward, my lord.
They're sure of it.

628
01:04:03,216 --> 01:04:06,667
--the illustrious Sir Thomas Colville!

629
01:04:22,526 --> 01:04:24,186
Adhemar withdrew.

630
01:04:24,528 --> 01:04:27,066
To withdraw like that means one thing.

631
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:29,354
Royalty.

632
01:04:39,751 --> 01:04:41,744
I'll see what I can find out.

633
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:45,254
Prepare to drop the flag.

634
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:48,300
No, no. Not yet. Wait, listen.

635
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:50,211
Musicians, announce.

636
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:53,921
-I must speak with my lord.
-Then go.

637
01:04:54,182 --> 01:04:56,720
See if you can beat the Second Coming.

638
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:59,387
Wait! Wait!

639
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:05,607
Colville is Edward, the Black
Prince, future king of England.

640
01:05:05,943 --> 01:05:08,232
He's in disguise like me
so he can compete.

641
01:05:08,445 --> 01:05:12,229
He's never met an enemy without
victory or town he couldn't defeat.

642
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:14,484
We're English! We know who he is!

643
01:05:14,743 --> 01:05:18,112
-You must withdraw. Tell them, Geoff.
-Absolutely!

644
01:05:18,372 --> 01:05:19,285
The lance.

645
01:05:26,755 --> 01:05:28,083
Give me the lance.

646
01:05:35,597 --> 01:05:36,759
Lance!

647
01:05:50,945 --> 01:05:53,103
Oh, my giddy aunt.

648
01:05:57,451 --> 01:05:59,989
The match is a draw.

649
01:06:03,165 --> 01:06:05,703
You mad? You endanger
a royal family member.

650
01:06:06,210 --> 01:06:08,167
He endangers himself.

651
01:06:08,962 --> 01:06:11,453
Well fought, Sir Ulrich, as in Rouen.

652
01:06:13,467 --> 01:06:15,210
You also, Prince Edward.

653
01:06:20,557 --> 01:06:22,799
-You knew me?
-Yeah.

654
01:06:26,813 --> 01:06:28,011
And still you rode?

655
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:33,188
-It's not in me to withdraw.
-No. Nor me.

656
01:06:35,738 --> 01:06:37,446
Though it happens.

657
01:06:39,826 --> 01:06:41,533
Yes, it does.

658
01:06:43,496 --> 01:06:46,662
-Good luck to you.
-You also.

659
01:06:49,210 --> 01:06:53,373
The winner of the mounted joust and
tournament champion...

660
01:06:53,672 --> 01:06:55,914
...Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

661
01:07:02,014 --> 01:07:05,347
-Melt it, sell it, do whatever you do.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

662
01:07:05,642 --> 01:07:06,805
You're champion!

663
01:07:07,019 --> 01:07:10,055
I'm not champion until
I defeat Adhemar. He withdrew.

664
01:07:10,355 --> 01:07:11,683
Sir Ulrich.

665
01:07:13,024 --> 01:07:16,856
-Tell me what you'll wear tonight.
-Nothing.

666
01:07:17,237 --> 01:07:20,024
We'll cause a sensation,
for I'll dress to match.

667
01:07:20,281 --> 01:07:22,819
Don't you get tired
of putting on clothes?

668
01:07:23,034 --> 01:07:25,525
She's talking about taking them off.

669
01:07:27,413 --> 01:07:30,367
A flower is only as good
as its petals, no?

670
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:32,374
A flower is good for nothing.

671
01:07:34,879 --> 01:07:36,077
Really?

672
01:07:36,881 --> 01:07:39,917
You can't eat a flower.
lt doesn't keep you warm.

673
01:07:40,176 --> 01:07:43,627
And a rose never knocked
a man off a horse either, did it?

674
01:07:45,973 --> 01:07:48,678
You're just a silly girl, aren't you?

675
01:07:51,895 --> 01:07:56,771
Better a silly girl with a flower than
a silly boy with a horse and stick.

676
01:08:01,404 --> 01:08:02,733
Goodbye.

677
01:08:06,910 --> 01:08:08,902
It's called a lance.

678
01:08:09,287 --> 01:08:10,746
Hello.

679
01:08:42,277 --> 01:08:43,937
-I have word.
-What?

680
01:08:44,279 --> 01:08:47,114
Adhemar was called back
to the free companies.

681
01:08:47,449 --> 01:08:50,366
Edward commanded it.
He could be gone all season.

682
01:08:51,453 --> 01:08:54,288
First Jocelyn and now Adhemar.

683
01:08:59,961 --> 01:09:01,336
Well done.

684
01:09:01,629 --> 01:09:03,788
Yeah, well done.

685
01:09:14,475 --> 01:09:16,800
The tournament results, my lord.

686
01:09:29,823 --> 01:09:30,986
Ulrich.

687
01:09:31,825 --> 01:09:33,154
Ulrich.

688
01:09:33,994 --> 01:09:35,157
Ulrich.

689
01:09:54,180 --> 01:09:55,343
-Geoff.
-William.

690
01:09:56,182 --> 01:09:57,842
I need to write a letter.

691
01:09:58,434 --> 01:10:01,104
'' Dear Jocelyn.'' No.
'' My dearest Jocelyn.''

692
01:10:01,396 --> 01:10:02,771
Better.

693
01:10:06,442 --> 01:10:07,605
'' I miss you.''

694
01:10:08,778 --> 01:10:10,236
Was that wrong?

695
01:10:10,446 --> 01:10:15,108
Well, it's up to you, really.
It's your funeral, I mean, letter.

696
01:10:16,202 --> 01:10:19,037
-Say something about her breasts.
-You miss them.

697
01:10:19,872 --> 01:10:20,903
Her breasts?

698
01:10:22,124 --> 01:10:27,118
Yes, you could, but I would tend
to look above her breasts.

699
01:10:28,547 --> 01:10:30,255
I miss her throat?

700
01:10:30,465 --> 01:10:32,791
Still higher. Towards the heavens.

701
01:10:33,051 --> 01:10:35,886
The moon. Her breasts
weren't that impressive.

702
01:10:36,179 --> 01:10:38,386
The moon? The moon.

703
01:10:41,726 --> 01:10:43,600
'' lt is strange to think...

704
01:10:45,230 --> 01:10:47,388
...I have not seen you in a month.

705
01:10:50,068 --> 01:10:53,401
I have seen the new moon, but not you.

706
01:10:55,573 --> 01:11:00,282
I have seen sunsets and sunrises, but
nothing of your beautiful face.''

707
01:11:04,582 --> 01:11:06,574
That's very good.

708
01:11:07,460 --> 01:11:09,915
I knew this girl once who....

709
01:11:11,255 --> 01:11:13,580
She broke my heart.
I said the pieces--

710
01:11:13,841 --> 01:11:18,502
''The pieces of my broken heart can
pass through the eye of a needle. ''

711
01:11:21,598 --> 01:11:23,674
He writes as though I had died.

712
01:11:23,934 --> 01:11:26,935
Yes, madame. He dies as well.

713
01:11:28,605 --> 01:11:31,274
She used to cook for the Duke of York.

714
01:11:34,277 --> 01:11:37,646
I miss her like the sun
misses the flower.

715
01:11:38,114 --> 01:11:41,115
''I miss you like the sun
misses the flower.

716
01:11:41,826 --> 01:11:45,444
Like the sun misses the flower
in the depths of winter.

717
01:11:47,123 --> 01:11:50,326
Instead of beauty to direct
its light to...

718
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:55,503
...the heart hardens like the frozen
world your absence has sent me to.''

719
01:11:55,798 --> 01:11:57,791
''I next compete in Paris.

720
01:11:58,843 --> 01:12:01,962
I'll find it empty and cold
if you're not there.''

721
01:12:03,138 --> 01:12:04,633
I like it.

722
01:12:05,474 --> 01:12:07,632
And now, to finish it.

723
01:12:09,019 --> 01:12:10,644
With '' hope.''

724
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:13,638
Love should end with hope.

725
01:12:14,983 --> 01:12:17,818
My husband, God rest him...

726
01:12:18,236 --> 01:12:20,478
...said something I'll never forget.

727
01:12:22,324 --> 01:12:23,818
'' Hope guides me. lt--''

728
01:12:24,075 --> 01:12:27,575
''It gets me through the day and
especially the night.

729
01:12:28,663 --> 01:12:31,154
The hope that after you
leave my sight...

730
01:12:31,416 --> 01:12:34,203
...it will not be the last time
I look upon you.''

731
01:12:38,005 --> 01:12:39,713
Finish it with.:

732
01:12:40,383 --> 01:12:44,594
''With all the love
that I possess...William.''

733
01:12:46,055 --> 01:12:47,134
You mean '' Ulrich.''

734
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:51,889
''With all the love I possess...

735
01:12:53,562 --> 01:12:55,389
...I remain yours...

736
01:12:56,273 --> 01:12:58,266
...the knight of your heart.''

737
01:13:07,242 --> 01:13:11,405
My master hoped you might have
something to send him in return.

738
01:13:26,219 --> 01:13:31,011
Cock-a-doodle once! I shall not deny
him. Twice! I shall not. Thrice!

739
01:13:31,808 --> 01:13:33,385
I deny him.

740
01:13:33,809 --> 01:13:35,185
Thrice he denied him!

741
01:13:41,275 --> 01:13:42,817
No Adhemar.

742
01:13:44,486 --> 01:13:45,685
No Adhemar.

743
01:13:51,368 --> 01:13:52,531
Wat.

744
01:13:55,664 --> 01:13:58,700
Tell me, did you see her?
Did she read the letter?

745
01:13:59,126 --> 01:14:01,118
Yes, and yes.

746
01:14:02,045 --> 01:14:02,994
And?

747
01:14:09,094 --> 01:14:10,552
She's coming to Paris!

748
01:14:14,182 --> 01:14:18,808
Did she give you anything for me in
return? A letter? A token?

749
01:14:19,437 --> 01:14:21,679
Did she give me a token? She did.

750
01:14:24,066 --> 01:14:25,395
Uh, I mean, um....

751
01:14:25,985 --> 01:14:28,690
Well, what is it? Give it to me.

752
01:14:37,496 --> 01:14:38,824
Yes!

753
01:14:41,208 --> 01:14:42,833
Hell, yes!

754
01:14:44,169 --> 01:14:48,001
She-- Because she's--
That means she-- Yeah!

755
01:14:51,843 --> 01:14:53,219
Cinquante.

756
01:14:54,346 --> 01:14:55,970
That's a nice round number.

757
01:14:56,723 --> 01:14:57,921
Ex cusez-moi.

758
01:15:01,644 --> 01:15:05,891
They wager that a Frenchman, not
Sir Ulrich, will win the tournament.

759
01:15:07,650 --> 01:15:09,358
But the amount is 50 florins.

760
01:15:09,611 --> 01:15:12,528
-That's all we got.
-lf we had 60, it would be that.

761
01:15:12,739 --> 01:15:15,229
Ulrich against every Frenchman here?

762
01:15:15,491 --> 01:15:19,192
He's won four tournaments in a row.
And Adhemar isn't here.

763
01:15:19,412 --> 01:15:22,412
I check shields too.
John Beaumont's here.

764
01:15:22,665 --> 01:15:26,283
Count Theobald, Philip of Burgundy--
all French champions.

765
01:15:26,544 --> 01:15:28,038
Englishmen will not win...

766
01:15:28,254 --> 01:15:30,045
...this French tournament.

767
01:15:30,422 --> 01:15:34,040
English legs are unsteady
on French soil.

768
01:15:36,553 --> 01:15:38,712
Shut your mouth, all right?

769
01:15:40,390 --> 01:15:44,767
Come on, Roland. It's a good bet.
Win and I can buy my own tavern.

770
01:15:45,103 --> 01:15:47,938
-I could write full-time.
-A forge for me.

771
01:15:48,231 --> 01:15:52,727
And because French wine
is too much for English bellies.

772
01:15:53,111 --> 01:15:58,022
Listen, I'm about this fonging close,
mate. I swear to God, Quasimodo!

773
01:15:58,616 --> 01:16:02,910
All I want is to go home, and I've
enough for that trip a hundred times.

774
01:16:03,246 --> 01:16:07,789
And most importantly, because
the pope himself is French!

775
01:16:10,419 --> 01:16:13,705
The pope may be French,
but Jesus is English. You're on.

776
01:16:14,757 --> 01:16:17,295
He won't lose with the princess
watching him.

777
01:16:17,551 --> 01:16:19,544
He's blond! He's pissed!

778
01:16:19,762 --> 01:16:24,470
He'll see you in the lists!
Lichtenstein! Lichtenstein!

779
01:16:24,725 --> 01:16:28,260
He's blond! He's tan!
He comes from Gelderland!

780
01:16:28,645 --> 01:16:30,638
He comes from Gelderland!

781
01:16:30,939 --> 01:16:33,810
Gelderland!

782
01:16:49,290 --> 01:16:53,288
-You think he will come?
-As sure as the sun will rise.

783
01:17:18,986 --> 01:17:20,812
You favor cathedrals.

784
01:17:23,490 --> 01:17:25,364
I come for confession.

785
01:17:28,662 --> 01:17:30,654
And the glass.

786
01:17:31,498 --> 01:17:34,831
A riot of color in a dreary,
gray world.

787
01:17:36,002 --> 01:17:37,496
Don't you think?

788
01:17:38,546 --> 01:17:40,171
It's beautiful.

789
01:17:44,344 --> 01:17:47,179
I feel the same about
the letter you sent.

790
01:17:50,057 --> 01:17:51,682
Speak to me.

791
01:17:52,351 --> 01:17:54,178
Speak those words.

792
01:17:56,397 --> 01:17:58,686
I will win this tournament for you.

793
01:17:59,483 --> 01:18:00,514
Excuse me?

794
01:18:00,734 --> 01:18:05,729
I'll win this tournament in your name.
I'll defeat each knight for you.

795
01:18:06,073 --> 01:18:11,031
Your beauty will be reflected in the
power of my arm and my horse's flanks.

796
01:18:12,079 --> 01:18:13,407
Wow.

797
01:18:14,539 --> 01:18:15,868
Really?

798
01:18:16,375 --> 01:18:18,700
Really? lts flanks?

799
01:18:22,047 --> 01:18:24,585
I wish to hear poetry, Ulrich.

800
01:18:26,051 --> 01:18:28,043
Well, I'm not ready.

801
01:18:29,929 --> 01:18:34,009
I am. Why must everything for
a woman be run on a man's schedule?

802
01:18:34,225 --> 01:18:37,724
Well, a man's day is fuller, and...

803
01:18:38,104 --> 01:18:41,105
...he has more demands on his time.

804
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:43,433
-ls that so?
-Yes.

805
01:18:44,110 --> 01:18:45,272
Maybe.

806
01:18:46,612 --> 01:18:47,727
No?

807
01:18:48,072 --> 01:18:50,444
I demand poetry...

808
01:18:51,242 --> 01:18:53,911
...and when I want it.
And I want it now.

809
01:18:57,081 --> 01:18:58,575
Your breasts...

810
01:18:59,958 --> 01:19:02,414
...they're below your throat....

811
01:19:03,587 --> 01:19:07,750
Jocelyn, how may I prove
my love to you? How?

812
01:19:10,218 --> 01:19:13,753
-Do you ask in earnest?
-Yes.

813
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,973
If you would prove your love...

814
01:19:20,645 --> 01:19:23,432
-...do your worst.
-My worst?

815
01:19:25,108 --> 01:19:26,436
What do you mean?

816
01:19:26,943 --> 01:19:31,770
Instead of winning to honor me
with your high reputation...

817
01:19:32,156 --> 01:19:34,943
...act against your character
and do badly.

818
01:19:35,284 --> 01:19:36,660
-Do badly?
-Lose.

819
01:19:36,911 --> 01:19:38,903
Losing proves that I'm a loser.

820
01:19:39,121 --> 01:19:42,656
Wrong. Losing is a much keener
test of your love.

821
01:19:42,958 --> 01:19:45,449
Losing would contradict
your self-love.

822
01:19:45,836 --> 01:19:49,287
It would show obedience
to your lover and not yourself!

823
01:19:49,590 --> 01:19:51,997
-Really?
-Woman, shh!

824
01:19:52,301 --> 01:19:56,797
Do not ''shh'' me and spare him!
Now be gone! Go!

825
01:19:59,933 --> 01:20:01,214
What is your answer?

826
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:07,138
I will not lose.

827
01:20:11,986 --> 01:20:13,646
Then you do not love me.

828
01:20:27,376 --> 01:20:29,416
The Protector of ltalian Virginity.

829
01:20:30,713 --> 01:20:33,500
The Lance that thrilled France...

830
01:20:33,841 --> 01:20:36,213
...the Harasser of Paraser!

831
01:20:36,510 --> 01:20:39,179
He gave them hell at La Rochelle!

832
01:20:39,888 --> 01:20:42,676
The Enforcer of our Lord God!

833
01:20:43,559 --> 01:20:46,513
The one, the only...

834
01:20:47,396 --> 01:20:49,684
...Sir Ulrich...

835
01:20:50,023 --> 01:20:52,561
...von Lichtenstein!

836
01:20:59,324 --> 01:21:00,783
God, I'm good!

837
01:21:06,039 --> 01:21:08,327
His horse's flanks.

838
01:21:08,917 --> 01:21:11,917
Maybe where he comes from,
it means love.

839
01:21:23,889 --> 01:21:24,969
What are you doing?

840
01:21:25,349 --> 01:21:27,507
-Losing.
-I don't understand.

841
01:21:28,310 --> 01:21:29,342
Neither do l.

842
01:21:49,748 --> 01:21:51,290
He loves me.

843
01:21:54,377 --> 01:21:55,622
Are you blind?

844
01:21:56,546 --> 01:21:59,333
-Did you see the flag?
-I saw it, okay?

845
01:22:00,258 --> 01:22:01,882
I know.

846
01:22:02,260 --> 01:22:05,426
You're dropping behind
for a more dramatic victory.

847
01:22:07,723 --> 01:22:10,927
Look, Jocelyn told me to lose
to prove my love.

848
01:22:13,562 --> 01:22:16,349
-I'd rather you were blind.
-Don't be foolish, Will.

849
01:22:16,565 --> 01:22:20,729
-Each woman wants proof, that's all.
-Proof of what?

850
01:22:21,487 --> 01:22:23,693
Her legs weren't uncrossed
for nothing.

851
01:22:23,906 --> 01:22:28,402
-I haven't uncrossed her legs.
-Then why are we doing this?

852
01:22:28,744 --> 01:22:29,989
Because!

853
01:22:42,132 --> 01:22:43,507
Because...

854
01:22:45,093 --> 01:22:46,421
...I love her.

855
01:23:28,385 --> 01:23:32,252
-I'm going to lose everything!
-That's why it's called gambling.

856
01:23:33,473 --> 01:23:35,133
Pain! Here's your pain!

857
01:23:35,475 --> 01:23:37,633
It's very romantic, though.

858
01:23:38,186 --> 01:23:40,428
Are you a woman or a blacksmith?

859
01:23:40,814 --> 01:23:42,438
Sometimes I'm both.

860
01:23:42,649 --> 01:23:44,475
Ooh, that chafes!

861
01:23:44,817 --> 01:23:46,146
Put him down.

862
01:23:49,697 --> 01:23:52,651
No knight has distanced himself
with victories.

863
01:23:53,034 --> 01:23:57,660
If you win your remaining matches
and your opponents take key losses...

864
01:23:57,955 --> 01:24:00,446
...you could make the semis,
or the finals.

865
01:24:00,666 --> 01:24:04,450
-At least the armor's proven itself.
-And your love?

866
01:24:04,837 --> 01:24:07,043
Have you proven that yet?

867
01:24:09,842 --> 01:24:14,171
Wat, you remember church as a boy.
The fear, the passion.

868
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:17,338
That's what she makes me feel.

869
01:24:18,183 --> 01:24:22,512
And for that, I say my rosary
to Jocelyn and no one else.

870
01:24:23,355 --> 01:24:25,846
William, that's blasphemous.

871
01:24:32,405 --> 01:24:34,196
Then may I burn in hell.

872
01:24:34,532 --> 01:24:35,730
Withdraw.

873
01:24:36,117 --> 01:24:38,359
Lose that way.
Take no more punishment.

874
01:24:38,911 --> 01:24:40,536
Oh, Roland.

875
01:24:46,419 --> 01:24:49,704
My lady sends this message.
If you love her--

876
01:24:50,089 --> 01:24:53,422
I know, I know. I must lose.
Isn't she watching?

877
01:24:53,759 --> 01:24:56,713
She says if you love her,
you won't lose again.

878
01:24:57,221 --> 01:25:00,720
She says if you love her,
you will win this tournament.

879
01:25:10,275 --> 01:25:13,726
There she is, the embodiment of love.
Your Venus.

880
01:25:13,987 --> 01:25:15,398
And how I hate her.

881
01:25:31,421 --> 01:25:36,047
-I don't understand women.
-Nor do I, but they understand us.

882
01:25:37,593 --> 01:25:39,253
Maybe not you.

883
01:25:51,357 --> 01:25:52,767
Yes!

884
01:25:53,484 --> 01:25:54,978
Women, eh?

885
01:26:18,508 --> 01:26:20,168
Forty-eight...

886
01:26:20,510 --> 01:26:21,885
...forty-nine...

887
01:26:22,178 --> 01:26:23,838
...and fifty.

888
01:26:24,138 --> 01:26:27,673
Thank you, gentlemen.
A pleasure doing business with you.

889
01:26:28,017 --> 01:26:31,801
Look us up if you're in London,
the World Championships, maybe.

890
01:26:32,021 --> 01:26:36,184
Don't look too sad.
Here, have a drink on me.

891
01:26:36,525 --> 01:26:41,483
He's quick, he's funny and
makes lots of money, Lichtenstein!

892
01:26:59,756 --> 01:27:01,914
Guinevere comes to Lancelot.

893
01:27:07,931 --> 01:27:09,923
Bed him well, my lady.

894
01:27:10,391 --> 01:27:11,933
Bed him well.

895
01:27:18,733 --> 01:27:20,441
We missed you at banquet.

896
01:27:22,028 --> 01:27:22,893
''We''?

897
01:27:27,616 --> 01:27:28,897
l.

898
01:27:30,411 --> 01:27:31,786
Jocelyn.

899
01:27:32,579 --> 01:27:34,239
Your prize.

900
01:27:36,250 --> 01:27:37,874
My prize.

901
01:27:40,128 --> 01:27:41,753
I am not worthy of a prize.

902
01:27:43,757 --> 01:27:45,465
Then who is?

903
01:27:47,094 --> 01:27:50,462
My maid tells me that
sometimes your varlets...

904
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:52,920
...call you William.

905
01:27:56,436 --> 01:27:58,060
Is this so, Sir Ulrich?

906
01:28:01,441 --> 01:28:02,603
Yes.

907
01:28:04,444 --> 01:28:05,439
lt is so.

908
01:28:19,458 --> 01:28:22,293
Your name makes no matter to me.

909
01:28:24,296 --> 01:28:26,787
Just so I can call you my own.

910
01:28:28,092 --> 01:28:30,761
But Jocelyn, I am your own.

911
01:28:38,143 --> 01:28:39,851
Damn, girl.

912
01:28:40,687 --> 01:28:42,015
You need a surgeon.

913
01:28:42,314 --> 01:28:46,442
He's been. He says I will live,
though it doesn't feel that way.

914
01:28:48,027 --> 01:28:51,028
Oh, William. This pain is my doing.

915
01:28:51,364 --> 01:28:53,024
Yes, it is.

916
01:28:56,828 --> 01:28:58,156
Although...

917
01:28:58,996 --> 01:29:00,372
...my father...

918
01:29:02,833 --> 01:29:04,992
...taught me to take the bad...

919
01:29:06,045 --> 01:29:07,504
...with the good.

920
01:29:14,845 --> 01:29:16,838
This good you speak of.

921
01:29:19,683 --> 01:29:22,008
It will be my doing as well.

922
01:29:39,035 --> 01:29:43,412
How long since any of you have been
back? I've only been gone 6 months.

923
01:29:43,706 --> 01:29:45,533
Two years for me.

924
01:29:46,417 --> 01:29:47,698
Three years.

925
01:29:48,836 --> 01:29:52,371
Five. Five long years.

926
01:29:55,051 --> 01:29:56,379
William?

927
01:29:58,387 --> 01:29:59,550
Twelve.

928
01:30:01,390 --> 01:30:02,932
Twelve years.

929
01:30:05,519 --> 01:30:07,097
He's to be an apprentice?

930
01:30:11,900 --> 01:30:13,015
How long for?

931
01:30:14,611 --> 01:30:15,892
Seven years.

932
01:30:49,937 --> 01:30:51,597
Sir Ector?

933
01:30:52,982 --> 01:30:56,433
I'm the thatcher. I spoke to you
outside London Stadium.

934
01:30:56,777 --> 01:30:58,604
Oh, yes. I remember.

935
01:30:59,113 --> 01:31:00,655
Is this the boy?

936
01:31:03,951 --> 01:31:06,489
Step forward, son. Let me look at you.

937
01:31:06,954 --> 01:31:08,946
Careful with that, Roland!

938
01:31:14,461 --> 01:31:16,619
Are you afraid of me, boy?

939
01:31:26,973 --> 01:31:29,262
Have you got most of your teeth?

940
01:31:34,981 --> 01:31:37,139
Show me your arm. ls it strong?

941
01:31:47,368 --> 01:31:50,534
Well, he's a half-starved little
scarecrow.

942
01:31:51,830 --> 01:31:53,657
But he has spirit.

943
01:31:57,502 --> 01:32:02,045
I can show you a great wide world
full of adventure...

944
01:32:02,883 --> 01:32:05,837
...and marvels you
do not yet dream of.

945
01:32:08,513 --> 01:32:11,384
Can you pack my horse and lead it?

946
01:32:18,189 --> 01:32:21,356
Well, come on.
Say goodbye to your father.

947
01:32:23,027 --> 01:32:27,523
He's a real knight, William.
Watch and learn all you can.

948
01:32:33,245 --> 01:32:35,571
It's all I can do for you, son.

949
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:40,037
Now go change your stars
and live a better life than I have.

950
01:32:50,929 --> 01:32:53,930
Roland, show the boy his duties.

951
01:32:57,602 --> 01:33:01,267
-Father? I'm afraid.
-Of what?

952
01:33:01,690 --> 01:33:03,682
I won't know the way home.

953
01:33:04,192 --> 01:33:08,024
Don't be foolish, William.
You just follow your feet.

954
01:33:27,256 --> 01:33:28,371
London.

955
01:34:15,761 --> 01:34:18,086
Give us a shout out, London!

956
01:34:40,118 --> 01:34:43,783
Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich!

957
01:35:21,158 --> 01:35:26,283
-Adhemar's here. He's entered.
-Must have grown bored with war.

958
01:35:26,496 --> 01:35:30,494
No, the Black Prince commanded it.
He had to disband his army.

959
01:35:30,751 --> 01:35:33,787
They were reveling,
pillaging town after town.

960
01:35:34,004 --> 01:35:36,874
Robbing, murdering,
ransacking churches.

961
01:35:37,173 --> 01:35:41,337
Committing the oldest sins
in the newest ways.

962
01:35:43,346 --> 01:35:46,382
At last we will face each other again,
Sir Ulrich.

963
01:35:46,683 --> 01:35:48,474
And at the World Championship.

964
01:35:48,685 --> 01:35:50,677
And as I promised you before...

965
01:35:51,020 --> 01:35:53,725
...you will look up at me
from the flat of your back.

966
01:35:59,570 --> 01:36:01,195
Let the past die.

967
01:36:02,198 --> 01:36:05,946
You've done well in my absence,
on the field and off, I'm told.

968
01:36:06,702 --> 01:36:10,237
Winning trophies, horses, women.

969
01:36:11,457 --> 01:36:13,164
You put them in that order?

970
01:36:13,876 --> 01:36:16,580
Generally, with a few exceptions.

971
01:36:23,593 --> 01:36:25,218
Beautiful, isn't she?

972
01:36:25,887 --> 01:36:29,090
A real thoroughbred trophy,
don't you think?

973
01:36:30,225 --> 01:36:34,139
-You speak of her like a target.
-Isn't she?

974
01:36:34,938 --> 01:36:36,100
No.

975
01:36:40,193 --> 01:36:41,651
She is the arrow.

976
01:36:45,781 --> 01:36:48,569
I've begun negotiations
with her father.

977
01:36:52,246 --> 01:36:54,073
I'm to make her my bride.

978
01:36:55,249 --> 01:36:57,740
She'll be saddled...

979
01:36:58,335 --> 01:37:00,577
...and placed on my mantle.

980
01:37:01,588 --> 01:37:03,664
Target or arrow, it doesn't matter.

981
01:37:04,591 --> 01:37:06,299
I will have her.

982
01:37:11,723 --> 01:37:14,012
Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich!

983
01:37:51,178 --> 01:37:55,045
-How would you beat him?
-With a stick, while he slept.

984
01:37:55,641 --> 01:37:58,345
But on a horse? With a lance?

985
01:37:59,144 --> 01:38:01,516
That man is unbeatable.

986
01:38:29,882 --> 01:38:31,045
Hello there.

987
01:38:34,178 --> 01:38:38,472
-You're Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein.
-Yes.

988
01:38:38,933 --> 01:38:43,310
You're my favorite knight.
When we joust, I always say I'm you.

989
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:48,098
What are you doing in Cheapside?
There's no parade today.

990
01:38:52,696 --> 01:38:54,320
Can you keep a secret?

991
01:39:09,879 --> 01:39:14,043
I was born in Cheapside,
just around the corner there.

992
01:39:14,384 --> 01:39:17,301
-Truly, Sir Ulrich?
-Truly.

993
01:39:17,595 --> 01:39:19,920
I only live just there.

994
01:39:21,641 --> 01:39:23,016
How old are you?

995
01:39:23,267 --> 01:39:26,434
-Nine and one half.
-Nine and one half.

996
01:39:27,104 --> 01:39:31,184
I wonder if you remember a man,
though he may have died long ago.

997
01:39:31,400 --> 01:39:35,065
He was as tall as a knight.
His name was John Thatcher.

998
01:39:35,404 --> 01:39:38,025
-Of course I remember him.
-You do?

999
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:40,398
Yes. He lives there still.

1000
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:49,078
Sometimes we see him sitting
at the window, but no one knows why.

1001
01:39:52,921 --> 01:39:54,000
What do you mean?

1002
01:39:54,589 --> 01:39:55,964
He's blind, sir.

1003
01:40:42,260 --> 01:40:43,838
Is someone there?

1004
01:40:48,641 --> 01:40:52,971
If you're here for the net,
I'm not done yet. Come tomorrow.

1005
01:40:57,275 --> 01:40:58,271
Who are you?

1006
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:02,435
A knight.

1007
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:08,527
My name...is Ulrich.

1008
01:41:09,787 --> 01:41:13,950
Ulrich? I hear that name
being chanted from the stadium.

1009
01:41:14,416 --> 01:41:16,290
What business have you here?

1010
01:41:16,794 --> 01:41:19,463
I have word, Master Thatcher.

1011
01:41:22,007 --> 01:41:23,038
Word of your son.

1012
01:41:24,301 --> 01:41:27,337
Of my William? Well, come in, sir.

1013
01:41:33,351 --> 01:41:36,685
What word? Does he live?

1014
01:41:39,065 --> 01:41:40,773
Aye. He lives.

1015
01:41:42,819 --> 01:41:44,479
He is very well.

1016
01:41:46,155 --> 01:41:48,029
He wanted you to know...

1017
01:41:49,867 --> 01:41:52,239
...that he changed his stars
after all.

1018
01:42:02,171 --> 01:42:04,543
And has he followed his feet?

1019
01:42:08,177 --> 01:42:10,798
Has he found his way home at last?

1020
01:42:12,264 --> 01:42:13,260
Yes.

1021
01:42:21,398 --> 01:42:22,513
Father.

1022
01:42:22,858 --> 01:42:25,693
Oh, William. Oh, my boy.

1023
01:42:36,621 --> 01:42:39,990
I should like to meet this Wat.
And Roland too.

1024
01:42:40,208 --> 01:42:42,200
You will, Father.

1025
01:42:45,254 --> 01:42:49,038
And what of women?
Is there a certain one or many?

1026
01:42:50,885 --> 01:42:52,593
There is a certain one.

1027
01:42:54,430 --> 01:42:56,387
I should like to meet her too.

1028
01:43:02,896 --> 01:43:05,222
This leak won't do, Father.

1029
01:43:05,816 --> 01:43:10,561
-Not in a thatcher's chamber.
-It's quite fitting for a blind one.

1030
01:43:12,906 --> 01:43:14,780
Well, a thatcher I am.

1031
01:43:16,451 --> 01:43:17,732
I'll fix it.

1032
01:44:02,245 --> 01:44:05,330
Alive. I thought he was dead,
which is mad...

1033
01:44:05,582 --> 01:44:08,832
...because he was also so strong.
Very strong.

1034
01:44:09,503 --> 01:44:11,460
-Geoff.
-Jocelyn.

1035
01:44:11,796 --> 01:44:14,252
This day just gets better and better.

1036
01:44:17,218 --> 01:44:18,381
Somebody die?

1037
01:44:21,639 --> 01:44:23,632
Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

1038
01:44:27,353 --> 01:44:28,634
Adhemar...

1039
01:44:29,647 --> 01:44:33,146
...followed you last night.
To Cheapside.

1040
01:44:33,901 --> 01:44:35,229
He saw your father.

1041
01:44:36,487 --> 01:44:39,239
Will, they asked me for your patents.

1042
01:44:43,827 --> 01:44:47,113
They're waiting for you
in the lists to arrest you.

1043
01:44:47,998 --> 01:44:49,658
A dozen royal guards.

1044
01:44:50,834 --> 01:44:55,829
-They'll put you in the stocks.
-But I face Adhemar in five minutes.

1045
01:44:57,340 --> 01:45:01,172
No, you forfeit.
They've already marked it down.

1046
01:45:02,345 --> 01:45:05,679
Saddle the horses.
They can arrest your baggage, not you.

1047
01:45:11,855 --> 01:45:13,397
Halt.

1048
01:45:18,694 --> 01:45:20,402
So, what do you think...

1049
01:45:22,907 --> 01:45:24,816
...now that you know what I am?

1050
01:45:26,202 --> 01:45:30,365
To know what you are, William,
would take a lifetime.

1051
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:33,875
One I am willing to give.
But now you must run.

1052
01:45:35,711 --> 01:45:38,036
Run, and I will run with you.

1053
01:45:38,380 --> 01:45:40,373
Jocelyn, I cannot run.

1054
01:45:40,716 --> 01:45:44,215
I am a knight, and I will
put myself to the hazard!

1055
01:45:44,595 --> 01:45:48,378
ln your heart, not on paper.
And paper's what matters to them!

1056
01:45:51,560 --> 01:45:53,682
William, I love you.

1057
01:45:55,730 --> 01:45:58,102
I love you. You.

1058
01:46:00,568 --> 01:46:05,147
-I won't see you led to the stocks.
-But you'll see me run? No!

1059
01:46:06,407 --> 01:46:08,400
Damn your pride, William.

1060
01:46:08,910 --> 01:46:11,745
It is only you that
will not see you run.

1061
01:46:11,996 --> 01:46:14,238
Pride's the one thing they can't take!

1062
01:46:14,498 --> 01:46:18,033
But they can take it from you.
They can and they will.

1063
01:46:18,794 --> 01:46:20,288
Oh, they will.

1064
01:46:21,088 --> 01:46:23,413
But love they cannot take.

1065
01:46:28,762 --> 01:46:31,087
And where will we live?

1066
01:46:32,266 --> 01:46:33,760
ln my hovel?

1067
01:46:35,477 --> 01:46:40,816
-With the pigs inside in winter?
-Yes, William, with the pigs.

1068
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:42,353
With the pigs.

1069
01:46:45,445 --> 01:46:47,105
The poor can marry for love.

1070
01:46:48,948 --> 01:46:51,784
Jocelyn, you speak of what
you do not know!

1071
01:46:55,663 --> 01:46:57,656
William, I beg you.

1072
01:46:58,458 --> 01:46:59,786
Please.

1073
01:47:02,295 --> 01:47:04,038
Run. Do it for love.

1074
01:47:12,096 --> 01:47:13,804
Roland, you would see me run?

1075
01:47:20,813 --> 01:47:21,975
And you, Geoff?

1076
01:47:22,815 --> 01:47:25,685
I wish it too, with all
the pieces of my heart.

1077
01:47:31,990 --> 01:47:35,157
Wat? You and l? We aren't runners.

1078
01:47:39,831 --> 01:47:40,994
Yes.

1079
01:47:43,001 --> 01:47:44,744
William, today we are.

1080
01:47:48,172 --> 01:47:49,548
Run, William.

1081
01:47:56,347 --> 01:47:58,386
I will not run!

1082
01:48:05,689 --> 01:48:07,232
I am a knight.

1083
01:48:20,203 --> 01:48:21,532
Well, boys...

1084
01:48:22,122 --> 01:48:24,530
...all good things must come to an end.

1085
01:48:25,459 --> 01:48:27,368
Let's end them together.

1086
01:49:04,663 --> 01:49:08,281
You will remove yourself
from this position of honor.

1087
01:49:10,377 --> 01:49:11,705
I am here to compete.

1088
01:49:12,129 --> 01:49:14,501
You are here to be arrested.

1089
01:49:21,972 --> 01:49:23,300
All right!

1090
01:49:51,709 --> 01:49:54,330
He that strives to touch a star...

1091
01:49:55,212 --> 01:49:56,872
...oft stumbles...

1092
01:49:57,214 --> 01:49:58,874
...at a simple straw.

1093
01:50:09,851 --> 01:50:11,559
You have been weighed.

1094
01:50:19,194 --> 01:50:20,901
You have been measured.

1095
01:50:23,906 --> 01:50:25,614
And you have been found wanting.

1096
01:50:31,247 --> 01:50:34,201
It's one loss or another...William.

1097
01:50:40,297 --> 01:50:44,046
ln what world could you
have ever beaten me?

1098
01:51:22,338 --> 01:51:23,797
Leave, Roland.

1099
01:51:24,882 --> 01:51:26,211
Let them have me.

1100
01:51:27,218 --> 01:51:29,045
God love you, William.

1101
01:51:29,428 --> 01:51:30,839
So do I.

1102
01:51:31,430 --> 01:51:33,588
Go! Disperse!

1103
01:51:35,893 --> 01:51:37,517
Or I will fong you!

1104
01:51:38,103 --> 01:51:41,057
As Jesus Christ the Nazarene
and his holy mother...

1105
01:51:41,315 --> 01:51:44,849
...the Virgin Mary are my witnesses,
I will fong you!

1106
01:51:45,777 --> 01:51:48,482
I will rip you! Fist! Pain!

1107
01:51:48,864 --> 01:51:53,027
I'll stick my fist and break you!
Pain! Lots of pain!

1108
01:51:59,290 --> 01:52:00,701
We're in trouble.

1109
01:52:04,462 --> 01:52:06,122
Listen to me.

1110
01:52:10,802 --> 01:52:12,794
Listen to me!

1111
01:52:45,502 --> 01:52:47,874
What a pair we make, huh?

1112
01:52:51,383 --> 01:52:53,505
Both trying to hide who we are.

1113
01:52:54,844 --> 01:52:56,173
Both unable to do so.

1114
01:53:05,188 --> 01:53:07,014
Your men love you.

1115
01:53:09,191 --> 01:53:12,358
If I knew nothing else about you,
that would be enough.

1116
01:53:13,904 --> 01:53:17,688
But you also tilt
when you should withdraw.

1117
01:53:20,202 --> 01:53:22,111
That is knightly too.

1118
01:53:30,379 --> 01:53:31,577
Release him.

1119
01:53:41,556 --> 01:53:44,557
He may appear to be
of humble origins...

1120
01:53:45,810 --> 01:53:48,894
...but my personal historians
have discovered...

1121
01:53:49,230 --> 01:53:52,848
...that he descends
from an ancient royal line.

1122
01:53:56,237 --> 01:53:57,945
This is my word.

1123
01:53:59,407 --> 01:54:02,906
And as such, is beyond contestation.

1124
01:54:08,249 --> 01:54:09,197
Now...

1125
01:54:10,584 --> 01:54:13,918
...if I may repay the kindness
you once showed me.

1126
01:54:15,255 --> 01:54:16,251
Take a knee.

1127
01:54:33,314 --> 01:54:37,312
By the power vested in me
by my father, King Edward...

1128
01:54:38,486 --> 01:54:40,942
...and by all the witnesses here...

1129
01:54:44,117 --> 01:54:45,445
...I dub thee...

1130
01:54:48,162 --> 01:54:49,443
...Sir William.

1131
01:55:01,717 --> 01:55:04,290
Arise...Sir William.

1132
01:55:11,685 --> 01:55:12,965
Can you joust?

1133
01:55:14,646 --> 01:55:16,639
There's my tournament to finish.

1134
01:55:17,149 --> 01:55:21,645
Now, are you fit to compete,
or shall the forfeit stand?

1135
01:55:22,487 --> 01:55:23,436
I'm fit.

1136
01:55:24,823 --> 01:55:29,734
I shall have your opponent informed.
Look for his shield on the lists.

1137
01:55:30,328 --> 01:55:31,656
At once.

1138
01:55:32,330 --> 01:55:33,741
Thank you, my lord.

1139
01:55:44,216 --> 01:55:46,672
All hail Prince Edward!

1140
01:55:51,682 --> 01:55:54,007
My lords, my ladies...

1141
01:55:54,893 --> 01:55:57,349
...and all you other people.

1142
01:55:58,188 --> 01:56:02,897
I give you the son of Philippe
de Vitry, son of Gilles....

1143
01:56:05,529 --> 01:56:07,521
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

1144
01:56:08,240 --> 01:56:11,241
It's nothing but spun sugar
and boot black.

1145
01:56:20,210 --> 01:56:21,787
It's a small target...

1146
01:56:23,546 --> 01:56:25,206
...but aim for his heart.

1147
01:56:31,387 --> 01:56:33,629
--doer of daring deeds...

1148
01:56:34,890 --> 01:56:38,259
...conqueror of countless kingdoms,
Count...

1149
01:56:42,064 --> 01:56:43,724
...Adhemar!

1150
01:58:28,876 --> 01:58:30,868
Oh, God. I'll get the surgeon.

1151
01:58:31,170 --> 01:58:32,201
Roland!

1152
01:58:32,755 --> 01:58:33,953
You're the surgeon.

1153
01:58:36,383 --> 01:58:37,498
Come on.

1154
01:58:45,267 --> 01:58:46,346
He tipped it.

1155
01:58:49,187 --> 01:58:51,345
Kate, get me back to one.

1156
01:58:51,731 --> 01:58:53,688
Otherwise we forfeit.

1157
01:59:00,865 --> 01:59:03,023
Dirty son of a bitch!

1158
02:00:13,268 --> 02:00:16,602
Kate, I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

1159
02:00:23,278 --> 02:00:25,436
As I said, thatcher.

1160
02:00:27,657 --> 02:00:30,611
In what world could you
have ever beaten me?

1161
02:00:31,286 --> 02:00:33,243
Such a place does not exist.

1162
02:00:35,665 --> 02:00:37,373
She's here William.

1163
02:00:39,544 --> 02:00:40,623
With your father.

1164
02:00:45,133 --> 02:00:46,710
Change your stars.

1165
02:00:51,764 --> 02:00:53,555
Let's dance, you and I.

1166
02:00:57,311 --> 02:00:59,019
It's two lances to none.

1167
02:00:59,313 --> 02:01:02,978
You must unhorse him or kill him.
It's the only way to win.

1168
02:01:12,993 --> 02:01:15,863
-You need more padding.
-No, leave it off.

1169
02:01:16,496 --> 02:01:18,156
I can't breathe with it on.

1170
02:01:23,837 --> 02:01:24,951
Lance.

1171
02:01:30,385 --> 02:01:31,927
I can barely grip it.

1172
02:01:32,178 --> 02:01:33,507
Damn.

1173
02:01:40,186 --> 02:01:41,514
Lash it to my arm.

1174
02:01:45,691 --> 02:01:46,889
Wat...

1175
02:01:47,610 --> 02:01:49,152
...lash it to me arm.

1176
02:01:52,323 --> 02:01:53,354
Do it.

1177
02:02:11,633 --> 02:02:13,175
Good people!

1178
02:02:14,219 --> 02:02:15,547
I missed my introduction!

1179
02:02:26,731 --> 02:02:28,391
But please...

1180
02:02:28,733 --> 02:02:30,393
...please, I pray you.

1181
02:02:30,902 --> 02:02:32,396
Hear it now.

1182
02:02:33,779 --> 02:02:35,737
For I would lay rest...

1183
02:02:36,073 --> 02:02:38,398
...the grace in my tongue...

1184
02:02:38,743 --> 02:02:40,403
...and speak plain.

1185
02:02:41,579 --> 02:02:43,405
Days like these...

1186
02:02:43,747 --> 02:02:47,412
...are far too rare to cheapen
with heavy-handed words.

1187
02:02:48,752 --> 02:02:52,620
And so, I'm afraid,
without any ado whatsoever--

1188
02:02:53,257 --> 02:02:54,632
Excuse me, my lord.

1189
02:02:55,092 --> 02:02:58,425
Here he is! One of your own!

1190
02:02:59,429 --> 02:03:02,347
Born a stone's throw from
this very stadium...

1191
02:03:02,682 --> 02:03:04,509
...and here before you now.

1192
02:03:04,851 --> 02:03:06,844
The son of John Thatcher...

1193
02:03:07,854 --> 02:03:10,855
...Sir William Thatcher!

1194
02:03:21,993 --> 02:03:23,024
That's your name.

1195
02:03:25,997 --> 02:03:27,989
Sir William Thatcher.

1196
02:03:28,791 --> 02:03:30,202
Your father heard that.

1197
02:03:48,310 --> 02:03:50,018
Godspeed, William.

1198
02:05:02,006 --> 02:05:04,711
William!

1199
02:05:25,738 --> 02:05:27,730
You have been weighed.

1200
02:05:29,199 --> 02:05:30,397
You've been measured.

1201
02:05:33,578 --> 02:05:35,737
And you absolutely...

1202
02:05:36,414 --> 02:05:38,074
...have been found wanting.

1203
02:05:42,253 --> 02:05:44,080
Welcome to the new world.

1204
02:05:44,631 --> 02:05:48,130
God save you, if it is right
that he should do so.

1205
02:05:54,724 --> 02:05:56,847
William!

1206
02:06:10,990 --> 02:06:12,650
Yes!

1207
02:06:14,076 --> 02:06:15,654
He's won! He's won!

1208
02:06:50,736 --> 02:06:52,396
You beat him, Will!

1209
02:06:57,076 --> 02:06:58,487
Oh, William.

1210
02:07:19,097 --> 02:07:21,090
I'm going to write this story.

1211
02:07:21,391 --> 02:07:23,384
About the prince and the knights?

1212
02:07:23,643 --> 02:07:28,601
No, all of it. All human activity
lies within the artist's scope.

1213
02:07:31,109 --> 02:07:32,936
Maybe not yours.

1214
02:07:35,109 --> 02:07:41,936
Resync: Xenzai[NEF]

1215
02:12:05,833 --> 02:12:06,996
Your round.

1216
02:12:07,272 --> 02:12:09,117
Resync: Xenzai[NEF]
