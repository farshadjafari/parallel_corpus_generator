1
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:00,352
I can tell you like it.

2
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:01,476
Oh.

3
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:02,850
I love it.

4
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:03,979
It's perfect.

5
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,113
Well, great.

6
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:06,691
It really is such a neat place.

7
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:10,452
You know, I showed it
to another girl this morning.

8
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,690
But to be honest,
I didn't like her very much.

9
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,164
She looks like trouble,

10
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:18,260
and I'm way too old to be
dealing with all that nonsense.

11
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:21,671
I go a lot on my gut feelings,
and I have a good one about you.

12
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,708
You remind me of my daughter.

13
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:25,641
Oh, thank you.

14
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:28,680
It's just what
I've been looking for.

15
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:29,804
Well, great.

16
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:35,786
Welcome to your new home.

17
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:50,232
I'll get things moving
on your application,

18
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,534
and we'll have you set up here
in no time.

19
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:59,044
Um, about the deposit, um...

20
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,646
Okay, I'll tell you what.

21
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:03,147
If it'll help you out,
and I imagine it would,

22
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,309
I'll agree to waive
all of the deposit stuff.

23
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:07,216
You just give me
the first month's down.

24
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,514
We'll call it a day, all right?

25
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:09,644
Really?

26
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:11,087
That would be incredible.

27
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:13,522
Well, I remember when
my daughter was looking

28
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,025
for her first apartment.

29
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:17,062
It's hard coming up
with all that money, isn't it?

30
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,221
You just promise me

31
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,731
that you are gonna take
good care of this place.

32
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:21,891
I promise.

33
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,730
Besides,
you'll be a good tenant.

34
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,269
I always trust my gut.

35
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,669
Well, you won't regret it.
I swear.

36
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:30,265
Oh, you know,
I have some things

37
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,243
I have to still take care of
with the gal that lives here.

38
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,904
You just get me the check
by Monday.

39
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,379
I'll have you in by the end
of the week,

40
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:37,847
if that's okay with you.

41
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:38,940
I can do whatever.

42
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:40,075
Good.

43
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,278
Thank you so much.

44
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,013
You bet, sweetie.
Bye-bye.

45
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:07,725
Heather, come on.

46
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:10,887
It's morning.

47
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:28,734
Please leave a message
after the beep.

48
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:31,867
Hi.

49
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,070
This is Samantha Hughes.

50
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:36,182
I'm calling in regards
to the babysitter flyer

51
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:39,183
posted outside my dorm.

52
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:40,877
I hope this is the right number.

53
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:45,549
If it is, you can reach me
at 815-1920.

54
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,159
I'm very interested.

55
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,387
Thank you.

56
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,623
Hello?

57
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,063
Samantha.

58
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:29,725
Yes?

59
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:34,238
You just left me a message
about the babysitting position.

60
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:37,104
Oh, yeah, I did.

61
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,143
How did you get this number?

62
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,908
Please excuse the urgency,
but if you're still interested,

63
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,778
I would like to meet you.

64
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,978
Sure.
That would be fine.

65
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:49,748
Well, I'm afraid
I'm not too familiar

66
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:50,947
with the layout over there.

67
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,080
Perhaps you could meet me

68
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:54,659
in front
of the Student Affairs office?

69
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:57,058
That's where I dropped off
my advertisements.

70
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:59,631
Okay, I know where that is.

71
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:00,960
Wonderful.

72
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,762
I'll see you there.

73
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:07,168
Right now?

74
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:09,172
Hello?

75
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,902
Psst.

76
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,570
All right, everyone.

77
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,603
Have a great holiday.
I'll see you guys next year.

78
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:52,609
Whoo-hoo.
Whoo.

79
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:41,377
So tell me all about it.

80
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:45,150
I want details.

81
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,555
Well, it's not too big.

82
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:48,991
When you walk in,

83
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:52,120
there's, like, a little
living room area on the left

84
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:53,459
and then a hallway
down the right.

85
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:54,863
Oh, it is carpet or hardwood?

86
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,025
Hardwood.

87
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,158
Good.

88
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:58,668
Carpet's filth,

89
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:01,205
especially for a germaphobe
like you.

90
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,639
I'm not a germaphobe.

91
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:05,869
What?

92
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,378
I don't like gross things.

93
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,482
Anyway,
the kitchen's kind of blah,

94
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:11,675
and so is the bathroom.

95
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:14,218
But I'll paint them cool colors
or something.

96
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,343
Yeah.

97
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:17,888
Oh.

98
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,184
I wish you had pictures.

99
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:20,519
Yeah, me too.

100
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,355
I'm sort of sucking
at explaining it right now.

101
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:24,690
But you'll see it soon.

102
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:27,664
Yeah, well, it sounds great.

103
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:33,536
Mm.

104
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:36,198
This pizza is nasty today.

105
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:37,900
Gross.

106
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,740
Ugh.

107
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,939
Megan, how am I gonna afford
all this stuff?

108
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,209
I'm-
You're gonna be fine.

109
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,114
It's gonna work out.

110
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:48,515
That's easy for you to say.

111
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:50,555
You're not the one
with $84 in her bank account

112
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,089
and a check to write on Monday.

113
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,591
Yeah, but just relax.

114
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,217
It's Wednesday.

115
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,853
You know, if it's a big problem,
I can always call my dad.

116
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:03,363
No, don't do that.

117
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:06,233
No, look, he really
doesn't care at all.

118
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,806
Look, I'm not saying
it's gonna get to that point,

119
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:11,375
but if it does,
you're never gonna be homeless.

120
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:13,138
Yeah?

121
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:17,409
It's so weird and annoying

122
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,142
the way that guy
stood you up today.

123
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:22,152
I know.

124
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:23,812
You're gonna find something.

125
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,218
Okay?

126
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:30,660
Did you go to the job board
at the intern office?

127
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:31,786
That ham-faced girl,

128
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,262
you know, in my class?

129
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,926
Yeah, she said there's
good stuff there sometimes.

130
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:38,263
No, I haven't been yet.

131
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:39,428
Although it would be cool

132
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:41,096
to get something easy
and under the table.

133
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,470
That's what was so good
about the babysitter thing.

134
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:46,305
Yeah, but it
could have been awful.

135
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,435
You know?

136
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,740
The kid could be from hell.

137
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:51,442
You don't even like kids anyway.

138
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:53,415
Yeah, I guess.

139
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:58,189
You know what you should do?

140
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,121
You should go around campus

141
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:03,922
and rip down all of the other
posters he put up,

142
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,258
and then nobody else calls him.

143
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:06,422
How do you like them apples?

144
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:07,794
That's good payback, right?

145
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:08,923
Nah.

146
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:10,093
What?

147
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:11,295
It's genius,

148
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:14,304
because then nobody else
will show up.

149
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,533
No, I just want to forget it.

150
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:17,665
No more drama.

151
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:21,473
All right, then.

152
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:23,804
You want to go?

153
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,611
Yeah.

154
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:52,596
Get a grip.

155
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,149
What the hell time is it?

156
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,284
Night.

157
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:20,785
Oh, shit.

158
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:25,220
Where's your friend?

159
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,793
Who cares?

160
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:34,496
Ugh.

161
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:40,644
Someone called for you.

162
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:42,236
Who?

163
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:43,905
I don't know.

164
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:47,486
Some dude, some guy.

165
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:50,987
I left his number on your desk.

166
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:59,863
Where?
Where did you put it?

167
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:01,523
Chill out.
It's there.

168
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,225
I just-

169
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,358
I don't know.

170
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:08,667
By your pens, maybe.

171
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:11,675
When was this?

172
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:21,915
Please leave a message
after the beep.

173
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:26,054
Hello, this is
Samantha Hughes again.

174
00:20:26,192 --> 00:20:29,457
I got a message that you called.

175
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:30,619
Samantha?

176
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:32,890
Yes?

177
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:34,863
Oh, thank goodness you called.

178
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,060
Quite frankly,
I didn't think you would.

179
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:38,465
I'm so sorry about this morning.

180
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:39,866
Things were very hectic for me,

181
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,463
and I got caught up in lots
of last-minute details.

182
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:44,439
It was a bit of a catastrophe.

183
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:47,068
It's all right.
Don't worry about it.

184
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:48,874
I spoke with another girl
this morning

185
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,243
who I thought was going
to work out,

186
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:53,545
but she turned out to be
totally unreliable.

187
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:55,142
And while I can
certainly understand

188
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,983
you being upset with me,
I must be honest,

189
00:20:58,124 --> 00:20:59,955
I'm in dire need of someone.

190
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,753
You mean tonight?

191
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:03,418
Yes.

192
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:04,654
It's very important.

193
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:06,264
Um-

194
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:08,832
I will pay you double
what I would have normally.

195
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:10,902
That's $100.

196
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:12,265
It's very simple.

197
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:14,668
It wouldn't take even
much of your time.

198
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:18,834
We would be home soon
after midnight.

199
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:19,967
Are you there?

200
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:24,640
Yes, um...

201
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:25,773
Okay.

202
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:26,907
I think I can do it.

203
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:29,112
Oh, thank goodness.

204
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:30,517
You're saving me.

205
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:32,920
And I promise to make this
as painless for you as possible.

206
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,014
That's okay.

207
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,457
I can always use the money.

208
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:36,788
Of course.

209
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:40,922
Let me give you the address.

210
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,191
- Hey.
- Hey.

211
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,356
Thanks for the ride.

212
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,627
I'm just your monkey
with a cigarette.

213
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:17,724
Okay.

214
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,209
The whole kit and caboodle
kicks off tonight

215
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,683
just after 10:30.

216
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,253
I know it's late
for some of you folks,

217
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:37,377
but stay up.

218
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:38,751
It's worth it.

219
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:41,155
Be sure to find a good spot
where you can see the sky.

220
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,256
Ugh.

221
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:47,991
I'm so sick of hearing
about that stupid eclipse.

222
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,898
It's, like, all anybody
can ever talk about.

223
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,526
They're like, "Oh, gosh.

224
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:55,231
"Are you gonna go see
the eclipse tonight? Buh."

225
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,510
Oh, God.

226
00:22:58,611 --> 00:23:01,842
You know, it's not like
the moon's gonna explode.

227
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:05,610
Although that would be
pretty cool.

228
00:23:07,353 --> 00:23:10,186
So do you want me
to come with you?

229
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:12,257
I don't have to see
Mark tonight.

230
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,291
He hates me anyway.

231
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:16,087
No, it's okay.

232
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:19,254
But I feel a little weird,
you know,

233
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:22,299
just dropping you out here
in, like,

234
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:28,304
in the middle of Jabib
or wherever we are.

235
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,568
I mean, I had to look at a map.

236
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:32,699
Well, don't worry.

237
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:33,800
I'm gonna be fine.

238
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:35,038
Okay.

239
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:39,106
Okay, but I have
to tell you something.

240
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:42,277
But you got to promise that
you're not gonna get mad at me.

241
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,410
What?

242
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:44,920
All right,
you can't get mad at me.

243
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:46,046
You got to promise.

244
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:47,989
- No.
- No-

245
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:49,424
I don't even know
what it is yet.

246
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:53,554
God-okay.

247
00:23:58,604 --> 00:23:59,798
Where did you get these?

248
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:00,963
I'm sorry.

249
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,630
You were upset, and I felt bad.

250
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:03,764
Megan.

251
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:04,933
I know, I know.

252
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:06,066
I'm sorry.

253
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:07,270
But look, like,

254
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:09,005
it was-it was like,

255
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:10,740
he was such a jerk
for standing you up.

256
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:11,907
Yes, he was.

257
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:13,609
And you were super bummed out.

258
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:14,741
You were.

259
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:17,185
And, like, we had
a really good idea.

260
00:24:17,323 --> 00:24:18,790
And I know that you
weren't gonna do it,

261
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:19,982
so I had to do it, man.

262
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,524
And I didn't know
he was gonna call you.

263
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,649
How could I have known that?

264
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:25,628
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

265
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:29,359
Well, now I know why
I got the job.

266
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:31,332
Nobody else called.

267
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,631
Just please let me
stay with you.

268
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:35,330
Please let me stay with you.

269
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,271
I will be so good.

270
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:39,867
I won't touch anything
or eat their food.

271
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:41,001
I won't take your money.

272
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,135
I just-well, I'll be there,

273
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:43,373
and we'll, like, hang out.

274
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:46,279
All right, okay.
I heard you the first 50 times.

275
00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:48,376
Can I come, then?

276
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,351
Let's just wait
and see how it goes.

277
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,354
They could be nice.
You don't know.

278
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:53,617
No, I do know.

279
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:55,489
Normal people do not pull
the kind of stuff

280
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:57,117
that those people
pulled with you today.

281
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:58,287
They just don't.

282
00:24:58,397 --> 00:24:59,523
Look who's talking.

283
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,223
That's different.

284
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:03,528
People make mistakes.
It happens.

285
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:05,894
I mean, hey, they live

286
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:07,027
all the way out here
in the country.

287
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,332
So they're at least
normal enough

288
00:25:08,474 --> 00:25:09,668
to have real jobs
that pay tons of money.

289
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:12,709
You think having lots of money
makes you normal?

290
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:17,214
You've clearly never met
my family.

291
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,909
Well, we'll see.

292
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,154
Yes, we will.

293
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,032
Hey, yo, check it.

294
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:11,932
Volvo.

295
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:14,596
Safest car on the road.

296
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:25,706
Holy crap.

297
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,005
Hi.

298
00:26:56,148 --> 00:27:02,917
I'm Samantha,
the babysitter.

299
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:05,751
This is my friend, Megan.

300
00:27:05,858 --> 00:27:07,416
Vincent Ulman.

301
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:11,121
Very nice to meet you both.

302
00:27:11,263 --> 00:27:13,322
Such beautiful girls.

303
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:19,967
Please come inside.

304
00:27:45,731 --> 00:27:48,723
Have a seat.

305
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,670
You're a doll for agreeing
to this.

306
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:57,035
I mean it.

307
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:59,144
Oh, it's nothing, really.

308
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:01,576
I can't tell you how much
of a relief it'll be

309
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:03,203
to get this night behind us.

310
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:06,249
You know, we only arrived
in town very recently,

311
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:08,410
and we really haven't had
a moment to spare,

312
00:28:08,554 --> 00:28:12,183
you know, what with the eclipse
and all.

313
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:15,418
So are you a teacher
or something?

314
00:28:15,561 --> 00:28:17,222
No.

315
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,057
I mean, not exactly.

316
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:20,426
Just-did you know
both of you live

317
00:28:20,566 --> 00:28:22,898
in one of the most perfect
places on Earth

318
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,525
to get a clear view
of it tonight?

319
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:28,572
We heard.

320
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:32,074
Yeah, this place is quite
the astronomer's dream.

321
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,543
Are you an astronomer?

322
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,615
No, not exactly.

323
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:39,546
Samantha, could I have
a word with you

324
00:28:39,685 --> 00:28:44,748
in the other room, please?

325
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:47,882
Um... sure.

326
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:15,986
I hope you don't have
a problem,

327
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:18,988
but you have to understand
that I am only paying one person

328
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:20,148
for their time.

329
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:22,283
Oh, yeah.

330
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,088
No, Megan's not staying.

331
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:25,560
She's just my ride.

332
00:29:25,664 --> 00:29:30,067
I don't have a car,
so she was just dropping me off.

333
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:31,328
Oh, good.

334
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:34,832
And please forgive me
for sounding rude.

335
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:39,933
It's just that my wife
is very on edge

336
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:43,172
about this whole situation.

337
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:44,339
You're not being rude.

338
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:48,283
I understand.

339
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:51,514
Unfortunately, no,
I'm afraid you don't.

340
00:29:51,657 --> 00:29:53,352
Excuse me?

341
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:55,960
Please sit down.

342
00:31:02,661 --> 00:31:03,855
You have to forgive me,
Samantha,

343
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:07,931
because I've not been
completely honest.

344
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:11,524
You see,
we actually don't have a child.

345
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:15,704
We have a child, but he's grown.

346
00:31:15,841 --> 00:31:19,038
This job tonight
is not for a child

347
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:20,838
but for my wife's mother.

348
00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:23,581
Oh.

349
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:24,704
Hear me out.

350
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:27,580
Mr. Ulman, um,

351
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,051
I don't have any experience
with anything like that.

352
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:31,678
I think maybe you should find-

353
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:35,553
Okay, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

354
00:31:35,694 --> 00:31:37,685
I didn't mean to-

355
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:42,693
Listen, this is not anything
like you're imagining.

356
00:31:42,801 --> 00:31:44,234
There's nothing medical

357
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:45,700
that you would
have to do whatsoever.

358
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:48,432
In fact, you don't have to do
much of anything and...

359
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,140
I find this all a bit awkward.

360
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:53,471
But you have to understand
I have only the best intentions.

361
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:55,773
I've been putting advertisements
out for the past two weeks

362
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:56,972
to get someone for tonight.

363
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:58,707
But nobody responds
to elderly assistants

364
00:31:58,817 --> 00:32:00,250
or home care anymore.

365
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:06,221
So I thought maybe "babysitter"
would get a better response.

366
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:07,814
But to be honest,
it didn't do much.

367
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:10,826
And like I said on the phone,
I only got one other girl.

368
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:15,399
And when I told her the truth,
she backed out, so...

369
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,901
I mean, I figure
it's all the horror stories

370
00:32:19,004 --> 00:32:21,564
that you read in the paper
and see on TV

371
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:25,439
that have scared away
girls of your age

372
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:29,172
from these types
of opportunities.

373
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:32,147
Yeah, there's a lot
of weirdoes out there.

374
00:32:33,852 --> 00:32:36,650
You're right.

375
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,688
And I sincerely apologize
for being dishonest,

376
00:32:38,824 --> 00:32:40,519
but what I'm asking of you
is not that different

377
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:41,819
than what you expected.

378
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,861
It's essentially
just like babysitting.

379
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:46,920
I'm sorry.

380
00:32:47,032 --> 00:32:48,124
I appreciate your situation.

381
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:49,290
I do.

382
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:51,026
Okay, what will it take?

383
00:32:56,341 --> 00:33:01,540
How about if I gave you
another $100?

384
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:08,044
Okay, okay.

385
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:10,450
$200.

386
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:12,989
That's $300 for one night.

387
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:15,149
Please.

388
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:16,783
You have no idea
how important this is.

389
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,823
$400.

390
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:33,504
Hey.

391
00:33:33,645 --> 00:33:35,476
Megan.

392
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,569
Jeez, come on.

393
00:33:36,715 --> 00:33:37,704
Hold on.

394
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:38,873
Megan.

395
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,006
Come on, wait a second.

396
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:41,846
Are you out of your mind?

397
00:33:41,987 --> 00:33:43,181
Do you remember the game plan?

398
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:44,982
The game plan was,
if they're weird, we leave.

399
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,489
This is beyond weird.
It's mental.

400
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:48,718
You know, they lied to you.
They lied to you.

401
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,157
- I know, okay.
- They're liars.

402
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:51,320
I know you're right.

403
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:52,555
But it's $400.

404
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:56,258
It's $400 for four hours.

405
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:58,028
This equals first month's rent
and then some,

406
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:00,194
and all I have to do
is sit inside and watch TV.

407
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:01,396
It's too good to be true.

408
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,703
Did you ever think
it is too good to be true?

409
00:34:04,843 --> 00:34:05,935
Megan, please.

410
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:07,874
I need the money.

411
00:34:08,013 --> 00:34:12,382
It's so stupid.

412
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:15,213
Ugh.

413
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:17,116
I'm so mad at you.

414
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:19,223
Look, you're being
a great friend right now.

415
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:20,585
But this is huge.

416
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,693
This one night changes
everything for me.

417
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:25,253
Come on.
It's only a few hours.

418
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:26,887
That's it.

419
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:29,193
Just promise me you'll be here
by 12:30, and then it's over.

420
00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:30,290
Just promise me.

421
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:33,199
Okay, fine, fine.

422
00:34:33,305 --> 00:34:34,294
12:30, right?

423
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:36,134
Okay, yeah.

424
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:22,145
Oh, God, Sam.

425
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:25,279
You can be such
a fucking idiot sometimes.

426
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:57,845
Oh, my God!

427
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,547
Oh, my God.

428
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:01,158
Oh, my gosh,
you scared the crap out of me.

429
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:02,850
Take it easy.

430
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:03,983
I'm sorry.

431
00:36:04,129 --> 00:36:05,653
I didn't mean to scare you.

432
00:36:05,797 --> 00:36:08,698
I just thought you could use
a light, is all.

433
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,698
So sue me for being helpful.

434
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,166
I almost just died.

435
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:13,361
Oh, my God.

436
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,132
I almost just had a heart attack
and died.

437
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,334
Here.
You do it.

438
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:19,807
It's safer.

439
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,172
Thanks.

440
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:32,985
All better?

441
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:36,083
Aces.

442
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:42,330
It's freezing out here.

443
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:45,426
Okay.

444
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:49,336
Where the hell
did you come from?

445
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:52,001
Did you just hide?

446
00:36:53,845 --> 00:36:56,746
Are you-are you not
the babysitter?

447
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,872
No, I'm not the babysitter.
My friend-

448
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,115
See, here we are.

449
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,159
Half your payment in advance

450
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:45,228
just to ease your mind.

451
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:47,298
And here's a little more
to get something to eat.

452
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:48,763
There's a number
on the refrigerator

453
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,390
for a pizza place.

454
00:37:50,502 --> 00:37:52,902
I know you college kids
love pizza.

455
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:54,471
Mom is asleep,
and as I said before,

456
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,574
there's really no need
for concern.

457
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:59,973
She's old, but she's actually
quite able-bodied,

458
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:03,239
actually
more able-bodied than...

459
00:38:03,348 --> 00:38:04,337
than myself, I hate to say.

460
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:06,074
But if she needs anything,

461
00:38:06,184 --> 00:38:07,276
she'll be able to get it
herself.

462
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:08,476
She's quite independent.

463
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,917
Most likely,
you won't even see her.

464
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:11,283
But you need to be alert

465
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:13,788
just in the off chance
that there's an emergency.

466
00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:14,914
You understand.

467
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:16,254
Mm-hmm.

468
00:38:16,361 --> 00:38:18,090
I mean, this is mostly
for my wife's benefit.

469
00:38:18,196 --> 00:38:20,255
She's, you know,
the paranoid type.

470
00:38:20,365 --> 00:38:21,423
But you get it.

471
00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:23,660
It all sounds easy enough
to handle.

472
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:24,791
Terrific.

473
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:25,925
Oh, right.

474
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:28,699
There's-

475
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,808
It's the number where we'll be

476
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:32,136
just in case you need us.

477
00:38:32,277 --> 00:38:35,303
Oh, yeah, there's a number
on fridge for pizz-

478
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:37,038
I already said that, didn't I?

479
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:39,107
Yeah.

480
00:38:39,217 --> 00:38:40,275
If this wasn't screwed on...

481
00:38:40,385 --> 00:38:42,785
but I've said too much as it is,

482
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:45,856
so I'm gonna get upstairs
and get the missus.

483
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:49,391
And you just make yourself
comfortable.

484
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:52,291
And I'll be back in two shakes
of a lamb's tail.

485
00:38:52,397 --> 00:38:55,389
Okay, thanks.

486
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:21,054
I've done everything
you asked.

487
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:24,923
Well, there's not going to be
any more mistakes.

488
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:27,395
No, this one, she's perfect.

489
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:28,726
We're not missing anything.

490
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:32,735
After tonight, everything
will finally be complete.

491
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:35,431
Please stop worrying.

492
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:40,237
I have it all under control.

493
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:01,598
Are you here for Mother?

494
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:04,201
Yes, yes, I am.

495
00:40:04,302 --> 00:40:07,294
Wonderful.

496
00:40:10,475 --> 00:40:12,136
You're a godsend.

497
00:40:12,277 --> 00:40:14,245
It's nothing.

498
00:40:14,379 --> 00:40:18,247
Not to us, it's not.

499
00:40:18,383 --> 00:40:19,475
Well, I'm glad to do it.

500
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,217
Hmm.

501
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:26,316
Vivian Ulman.

502
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:27,446
Samantha.

503
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:28,581
Sam.

504
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:31,456
Nice to meet you.

505
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:33,930
What's the matter, Sam?

506
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:35,657
Oh, nothing.

507
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,994
I just-

508
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:40,161
I thought your husband
went upstairs looking for you,

509
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:43,069
and I didn't expect to see you
come in from over there.

510
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:46,109
I just-I get disoriented
sometimes.

511
00:40:46,244 --> 00:40:50,078
My friend Megan says
I'm out to lunch.

512
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:51,409
I was downstairs
in the basement

513
00:40:51,516 --> 00:40:52,676
looking for my furs.

514
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:55,843
I just can't get used
to this cold weather.

515
00:40:55,987 --> 00:40:58,148
I love the heat.

516
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,847
We're from the desert, you know.

517
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:00,980
Oh?

518
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,114
Mm-hmm.

519
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,921
What about you?

520
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:05,586
Is this your home?

521
00:41:05,697 --> 00:41:07,187
Yeah.

522
00:41:07,332 --> 00:41:09,766
Well, it's more downstate,
but it's pretty much the same.

523
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:12,427
I don't like the cold
much either.

524
00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:14,095
And now you're in university.

525
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:16,696
You look awfully young
to be in college.

526
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:19,173
Everybody says that.

527
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,709
But I'm a sophomore.

528
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:22,540
Oh, a sophomore.

529
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,204
Wow.

530
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:27,113
You could have fooled me.

531
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:29,948
I bet the boys really like you.

532
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:31,112
I guess.

533
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:32,484
Hmm, you guess.

534
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:35,683
Of course they do.

535
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:38,295
A fine young beauty like you.

536
00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:42,457
I remember when I was your age.

537
00:41:42,567 --> 00:41:46,059
Your mother must
worry herself silly.

538
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,501
Here we go.

539
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:03,311
Ah, you two have met.

540
00:42:03,421 --> 00:42:05,912
Excellent.

541
00:42:06,057 --> 00:42:09,049
Yes, and she's delightful.

542
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,251
I couldn't be more pleased,

543
00:42:10,395 --> 00:42:11,862
and I know that Mother
will feel the same.

544
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:13,156
Good, very good.

545
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:16,665
You see, things are working out
perfectly after all.

546
00:42:16,768 --> 00:42:17,757
And you doubted me.

547
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:19,369
I know.

548
00:42:19,504 --> 00:42:21,438
You were right, and I was wrong.

549
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:23,335
I'm sorry.

550
00:42:23,441 --> 00:42:25,170
Well, then let's get to it.

551
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:27,710
Mustn't let the night
get away from us.

552
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:29,005
Isn't that right, Samantha?

553
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:31,047
That's right.

554
00:42:31,182 --> 00:42:34,174
Oh, and Mother
is very private.

555
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:35,843
So don't be put off by it.

556
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:37,215
It's just her way.

557
00:42:37,355 --> 00:42:38,515
Don't worry.

558
00:42:38,623 --> 00:42:41,023
I warned her about both of you.

559
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:48,596
You did, did you?

560
00:42:53,271 --> 00:42:55,364
Oh, yeah, don't forget
the pizza on the refrigerator.

561
00:44:22,527 --> 00:44:23,516
Hello?

562
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:24,787
Hey.

563
00:44:24,896 --> 00:44:28,457
Oh, I'm not actually here.

564
00:44:28,566 --> 00:44:31,467
But leave me a message,
and I'll call you right back.

565
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:52,916
Hello?

566
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:56,322
Oh, I'm not actually here.

567
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:59,362
But leave me a message,
and I'll call you right back.

568
00:44:59,497 --> 00:45:00,486
Beep!

569
00:45:00,598 --> 00:45:03,761
Megan, it's me.
Pick up.

570
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:07,029
You're still not home yet?

571
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:10,937
Sorry if you're mad.

572
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:12,201
All right, I'll call you back.

573
00:45:12,343 --> 00:45:13,776
It's not that bad.

574
00:45:13,911 --> 00:45:15,902
Just hurry up and be home.

575
00:46:13,504 --> 00:46:14,971
Pizza Pizza.
What you eating?

576
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:16,232
Yeah, hi.

577
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:18,331
I'd like to place an order
for delivery.

578
00:46:18,476 --> 00:46:21,968
Okay, your address?

579
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:24,775
Uh, one second.

580
00:46:28,653 --> 00:46:34,421
Uh, it is...
7714 East Beaumont.

581
00:46:34,525 --> 00:46:36,186
East Beaumont?

582
00:46:36,327 --> 00:46:38,352
Very cool.

583
00:46:38,496 --> 00:46:39,986
What can I get for you?

584
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:41,155
Extra anchovies?

585
00:46:42,433 --> 00:46:44,697
No, just a small pizza
with pepperoni.

586
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:46,132
We don't have small.

587
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:47,669
Only medium and large.

588
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,602
Okay, medium is fine.

589
00:46:49,707 --> 00:46:51,038
All right.

590
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:53,643
One medium pep.

591
00:46:53,778 --> 00:46:56,679
That's going to be eight bucks.

592
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,008
Okay, thank you.

593
00:46:58,149 --> 00:46:59,673
No, thank you.

594
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:02,809
See you in 30.

595
00:51:06,764 --> 00:51:08,755
Hello, fish.

596
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:06,906
Good evening.
I'm Elaine Cross.

597
00:54:07,044 --> 00:54:08,136
And I'm Ted Stephen.

598
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:10,439
And welcome back
to Channel 13 News.

599
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:13,607
Tonight's big eclipse
is now well under way.

600
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:15,082
It is a total lunar eclipse,

601
00:54:15,219 --> 00:54:18,985
which I'm told means up to
two hours of no moon visibility.

602
00:54:19,123 --> 00:54:20,215
But more than half the moon

603
00:54:20,324 --> 00:54:22,315
has already entered
the Earth's shadow.

604
00:54:22,459 --> 00:54:24,393
Observers from all over
the Western Hemisphere

605
00:54:24,495 --> 00:54:26,656
are watching
this spectacular event.

606
00:54:26,797 --> 00:54:28,924
In fact, it's visible
from every continent

607
00:54:29,066 --> 00:54:31,091
this side of the globe,
except Antarctica.

608
00:54:31,235 --> 00:54:33,135
The best time to see
this fascinating event

609
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:35,135
will be just about
the stroke of midnight.

610
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:37,137
That's when you'll be able
to see the moon itself

611
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:40,004
actually disappear
into the Earth's shadow.

612
00:54:40,144 --> 00:54:41,509
And that's it for us tonight.

613
00:54:41,645 --> 00:54:43,237
Stay tuned
for a special presentation

614
00:54:43,347 --> 00:54:45,611
of Frightmare Theatre
coming up next.

615
00:54:45,749 --> 00:54:46,738
Ooh, scary.

616
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:47,908
Good night for a movie.

617
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:49,246
Get the popcorn ready.

618
00:54:49,353 --> 00:54:52,015
I like mine with butter.

619
00:57:15,332 --> 00:57:17,459
Shit.

620
00:57:30,414 --> 00:57:33,508
Man.

621
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:35,515
Frickin' idiot.

622
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:06,639
Huh.

623
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:13,512
I thought she said
these were in the basement.

624
00:58:43,253 --> 00:58:45,050
Hey, yo, check it.

625
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:47,383
Volvo.

626
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:27,590
Hello?

627
01:00:27,691 --> 01:00:30,990
Oh, I'm not actually here.

628
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:33,289
But leave me a message
and I'll-

629
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:04,650
Get a grip.

630
01:02:25,375 --> 01:02:30,210
Hello?

631
01:02:30,313 --> 01:02:33,407
Mrs. Ulman?

632
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:36,542
Shit.

633
01:03:51,361 --> 01:03:55,354
Is everything all right
in there?

634
01:05:28,658 --> 01:05:30,285
Keep the change.

635
01:05:34,397 --> 01:05:35,796
Have a good night, ma'am.

636
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:39,095
You too.

637
01:06:46,069 --> 01:06:47,058
We're sorry.

638
01:06:47,203 --> 01:06:48,693
Your call cannot be completed
as dialed.

639
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:50,999
Please check the number
and dial again

640
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:53,131
or call your operator-

641
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:03,518
It's okay.

642
01:07:03,653 --> 01:07:05,086
Everything's fine.

643
01:07:05,221 --> 01:07:07,485
She's fine.

644
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:10,753
Just relax.

645
01:07:10,894 --> 01:07:13,988
Just get a grip.

646
01:07:14,097 --> 01:07:15,587
Get a grip.

647
01:07:19,903 --> 01:07:20,927
Megan?

648
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:23,402
This is Gloria
with emergency services.

649
01:07:24,741 --> 01:07:26,936
We received a call
from this address.

650
01:07:27,076 --> 01:07:28,373
I'm sorry.

651
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:30,911
I thought I hung up
before it connected.

652
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:34,073
Do you have an emergency?

653
01:07:34,217 --> 01:07:35,206
No.

654
01:07:35,351 --> 01:07:36,340
Everything is fine.

655
01:07:36,452 --> 01:07:38,420
I didn't mean to call.

656
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:39,579
All right, then.

657
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:41,189
Well, please remember
that this line

658
01:07:41,291 --> 01:07:43,452
is reserved
for emergencies only.

659
01:07:43,593 --> 01:07:44,617
Yeah, I know.

660
01:07:44,761 --> 01:07:45,750
It was an accident.

661
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:46,884
I'm sorry.

662
01:07:47,030 --> 01:07:49,191
Okay, have a good night, then.

663
01:07:49,299 --> 01:07:52,291
Thanks.

664
01:09:34,137 --> 01:09:37,129
Ugh.

665
01:12:26,576 --> 01:12:27,975
Ugh.

666
01:19:32,935 --> 01:19:35,165
Get her!

667
01:19:50,853 --> 01:19:52,787
My eye!
My eye!

668
01:19:52,921 --> 01:19:53,979
My eye!

669
01:20:02,765 --> 01:20:05,757
Megan!

670
01:20:14,877 --> 01:20:17,311
Ah!

671
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:21,426
There you are.

672
01:22:30,446 --> 01:22:31,913
It's happening.

673
01:22:32,014 --> 01:22:33,845
No matter what you do,
it won't stop.

674
01:22:33,982 --> 01:22:35,847
It can't be stopped.

675
01:22:35,984 --> 01:22:37,975
You'll see.

676
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:41,112
It's gonna work in spite of you,
you little bitch.

677
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,665
Talk to me, lord.

678
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:55,531
Talk to me.

679
01:22:55,671 --> 01:22:57,161
Please.

680
01:22:59,508 --> 01:23:01,703
Talk to me.

681
01:23:01,844 --> 01:23:04,039
Please, lord.

682
01:23:04,179 --> 01:23:08,616
I beg you.

683
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:31,624
Samantha, wait!

684
01:25:21,917 --> 01:25:23,475
Samantha, listen to me.

685
01:25:23,619 --> 01:25:24,608
Get away from me!

686
01:25:24,753 --> 01:25:25,742
Just stop.

687
01:25:25,854 --> 01:25:26,912
Just speak with me.

688
01:25:27,022 --> 01:25:28,853
Stay back!

689
01:25:28,991 --> 01:25:30,424
All right.

690
01:25:30,525 --> 01:25:32,254
You don't need to do that.

691
01:25:34,162 --> 01:25:38,861
What have you done to me?

692
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:41,295
They're calling to you.

693
01:25:41,436 --> 01:25:43,666
Just listen to them.

694
01:25:50,045 --> 01:25:51,103
He's given the sign.

695
01:25:51,213 --> 01:25:53,204
He's chosen you.

696
01:25:53,348 --> 01:25:55,043
It's your destiny to accept him.

697
01:25:55,183 --> 01:25:56,343
No!

698
01:25:59,955 --> 01:26:02,048
Okay, go ahead.
Go ahead.

699
01:26:02,190 --> 01:26:03,452
Kill me if you want.

700
01:26:03,558 --> 01:26:07,153
I'm just a messenger
who carries out his words.

701
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:15,336
Only moments away now.

702
01:26:25,681 --> 01:26:26,841
No, no!

703
01:26:39,161 --> 01:26:41,152
Astronomers everywhere
are still baffled

704
01:26:41,263 --> 01:26:43,322
by how to explain
the bizarre event.

705
01:26:43,432 --> 01:26:45,263
It seems that the speed at which

706
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:47,061
the moon exited
the Earth's shadow

707
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:49,932
was faster than believed
theoretically possible.

708
01:26:50,072 --> 01:26:52,199
And while this may be
intriguing to many,

709
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:54,831
scientists around the globe
cannot agree

710
01:26:54,943 --> 01:26:56,774
on exactly why this occurred.

711
01:26:56,912 --> 01:26:59,437
But experts are working hard
searching for answers,

712
01:26:59,581 --> 01:27:02,209
and we will keep you informed
of any and all developments

713
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:05,342
as they come in.

714
01:28:40,882 --> 01:28:44,045
Poor thing.

715
01:28:44,186 --> 01:28:45,175
Don't worry.

716
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:50,019
You're gonna be just fine.

717
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:53,025
Both of you.
