1
00:01:38,358 --> 00:01:40,038
I mean, it's pretty
dumb, but whatever.

2
00:01:40,118 --> 00:01:41,406
Look at this.

3
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:43,158
Oh, my God,
that's so pretty.

4
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:45,726
I love it. Thank you
so much, Aunt Nicole.

5
00:01:45,798 --> 00:01:46,758
Isn't it
pretty, Brit?

6
00:01:46,838 --> 00:01:50,319
Dad? More decaf?

7
00:01:50,398 --> 00:01:53,159
So, you two. High school.
That's pretty great.

8
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:55,159
I guess. It's gonna
be sorta weird though.

9
00:01:55,238 --> 00:01:56,886
Really?

10
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,683
Our school is kind of a
feeder for New Trier's

11
00:01:58,758 --> 00:02:00,646
so we're gonna know like
a ton of people already.

12
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,646
Here, Annie.

13
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:03,083
Happy Birthday!

14
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:08,484
It's like the one you saw
on The Hills, right?

15
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:10,640
I don't think The Hills are
the role models we were looking for.

16
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:12,279
It's a bit revealing,
don't you think?

17
00:02:12,359 --> 00:02:13,722
She's fourteen,
you guys.

18
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:15,043
Yeah, no need
to remind me.

19
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:19,287
- So. You did great.
- Mmm hmm!

20
00:02:19,359 --> 00:02:20,919
Come on.

21
00:02:20,999 --> 00:02:22,287
Come on what?

22
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:24,246
Give it to me.

23
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,567
What's she talking about?

24
00:02:31,559 --> 00:02:33,359
It's a heavy box.

25
00:02:36,119 --> 00:02:37,800
It's the new
MacBook Pro.

26
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:40,040
It's got a four
gigabyte hard drive

27
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,920
2.53 gigahertz proc--

28
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:45,204
What? I know what
that means.

29
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,884
I think you're actually
passing wind at this point.

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,887
Daddy.

31
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,925
it's getting
late, Banannie.

32
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,722
Five more minutes, Dad, please?
It's still my birthday.

33
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,361
All right.
11:15.

34
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,481
Promise.

35
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,800
Who are you
talking to?

36
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,724
I'm chatting, Dad.

37
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,081
My friend Charlie
from California.

38
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,441
He's a junior and plays
volleyball for his high school.

39
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,521
Ooh, a junior.
Well, he's obviously a very smart kid.

40
00:03:26,761 --> 00:03:28,408
LOL. Laugh
out loud. Right?

41
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,564
Nice one, Dad.

42
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,684
PWOMS?

43
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:36,642
"Parent watching
over my shoulder."

44
00:03:36,721 --> 00:03:38,009
And what is that?

45
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:40,842
"Laughing my ass off.
Me too."

46
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,049
No, wait.

47
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,525
Dad, can you go talk to Mom about
mortgage payments or something.

48
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,325
All right. Good night,
birthday girl.

49
00:03:48,401 --> 00:03:49,722
Good night.
Love you.

50
00:03:49,801 --> 00:03:51,362
Love you.

51
00:03:53,361 --> 00:03:54,922
All right.
Let's see what you got.

52
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:01,241
There you go, ladies.
Touch the line.

53
00:04:01,322 --> 00:04:04,203
Make sure you're
touching the line.

54
00:04:04,281 --> 00:04:06,442
Last one.
You're almost there.

55
00:04:34,682 --> 00:04:36,089
Hey, Annie, come here!

56
00:04:36,162 --> 00:04:37,962
This is Serena.

57
00:04:38,042 --> 00:04:40,290
So, you're Peter
Cameron's little sister.

58
00:04:40,362 --> 00:04:42,010
Your brother's
hot as shit.

59
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,331
Uh, thanks, I guess.

60
00:04:44,442 --> 00:04:47,486
So, I'm having a little
party at my house Saturday night

61
00:04:47,563 --> 00:04:49,647
and you, little
Cameron, are invited.

62
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:52,363
Okay. Uh,
thanks, Serena.

63
00:04:52,442 --> 00:04:53,490
Tell your brother.

64
00:04:59,483 --> 00:05:01,087
ls it deliberate?

65
00:05:01,162 --> 00:05:04,447
NO, not at all.

66
00:05:04,523 --> 00:05:06,410
Hey, honey?

67
00:05:06,483 --> 00:05:07,891
No phones
at the table, please.

68
00:05:08,722 --> 00:05:10,403
Sorry.

69
00:05:10,482 --> 00:05:12,130
Katie, will you take a
picture of me and Peter?

70
00:05:12,203 --> 00:05:13,970
Hey, what did Mom just say?

71
00:05:14,042 --> 00:05:16,607
I was just gonna send a
photo to Charlie, but okay.

72
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:19,170
So, seriously,
what's this guy's deal?

73
00:05:19,243 --> 00:05:22,648
Well, he's smart.
And funny.

74
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:26,171
His brother's being recruited
by UC Berkeley for football

75
00:05:26,244 --> 00:05:28,524
and that's where he wants
to go, but for volleyball.

76
00:05:28,603 --> 00:05:30,207
Oh, right.
The girl's sport.

77
00:05:30,283 --> 00:05:32,531
What do his parents do?

78
00:05:32,603 --> 00:05:34,687
His mom teaches
kids with autism

79
00:05:34,763 --> 00:05:36,530
and his dad
works for ESPN.

80
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:38,523
I don't know,
sweetheart.

81
00:05:38,603 --> 00:05:42,487
Sounds like he's got too much
going for him for my likin'.

82
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,765
Hey.

83
00:06:15,164 --> 00:06:17,652
Yeah, I know
what you're talking about.

84
00:06:17,724 --> 00:06:19,612
I'm looking at them right now.

85
00:06:19,684 --> 00:06:22,773
These are definitely for a
clothing company, right?

86
00:06:22,845 --> 00:06:25,005
So why isn't anybody
wearing a shirt?

87
00:06:25,124 --> 00:06:30,089
No, I'm kidding. Yeah.
They're good. Go with it. Okay. Bye.

88
00:06:30,164 --> 00:06:31,769
Hi, Mom!

89
00:06:31,844 --> 00:06:33,252
Hey, honey, how'd it go?

90
00:06:33,324 --> 00:06:34,491
I made the team!

91
00:06:34,564 --> 00:06:36,452
You did? That's great!

92
00:06:36,525 --> 00:06:39,209
What happened?

93
00:06:39,285 --> 00:06:40,409
Annie?

94
00:06:43,204 --> 00:06:45,889
Come on.
Where are you?

95
00:06:45,965 --> 00:06:47,569
About time.

96
00:06:47,645 --> 00:06:50,526
Hi, Charlie.

97
00:06:57,485 --> 00:06:59,526
Where's mine, bozo?

98
00:07:05,965 --> 00:07:07,045
What?

99
00:07:12,405 --> 00:07:15,930
"I'm really 20.
Sophomore at UC Berkeley."

100
00:07:16,005 --> 00:07:18,209
What?

101
00:07:25,126 --> 00:07:27,407
Twenty?

102
00:08:04,647 --> 00:08:05,891
Bye.

103
00:08:13,687 --> 00:08:15,215
Hello.

104
00:08:18,087 --> 00:08:19,495
Wow.

105
00:08:45,967 --> 00:08:48,575
Hi, girls.
So did your brother come with?

106
00:08:48,648 --> 00:08:50,689
No, he's packing
for college.

107
00:08:50,767 --> 00:08:53,856
Great.
Looks like I wore these for nothing.

108
00:08:53,927 --> 00:08:55,488
Come join us.

109
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:57,891
We're teaching Alexa
how to give a blow job.

110
00:08:57,968 --> 00:08:59,408
She sucks.
She keeps gagging.

111
00:08:59,488 --> 00:09:01,736
Serena, where's
your bathroom?

112
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:05,016
We have like six of them.
Go down the hall. You'll find one.

113
00:09:09,528 --> 00:09:11,252
Hi, Dad.

114
00:09:11,328 --> 00:09:13,576
Hey, sweetheart.
You have a good time?

115
00:09:13,648 --> 00:09:15,175
Mm-hm.

116
00:09:15,248 --> 00:09:17,649
Those girls kinda
freaked me out though.

117
00:09:17,728 --> 00:09:19,409
Yeah ?

118
00:09:19,488 --> 00:09:23,810
L-l really want them
to like me, you know?

119
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:25,132
It means a lot.

120
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:27,456
Just be yourself

121
00:09:27,528 --> 00:09:30,168
If the Serenas of the world
don't like it, it's their loss.

122
00:09:30,248 --> 00:09:31,853
No, it's
high school, Dad.

123
00:09:31,928 --> 00:09:33,129
If the Serenas of the
world don't like me

124
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:35,816
I'm screwed.
You get it?

125
00:09:35,888 --> 00:09:40,657
Not really, no.
Sorry, I've, I've really gotta--

126
00:09:40,729 --> 00:09:42,333
Yeah, okay.

127
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:45,809
Night.

128
00:09:45,888 --> 00:09:47,329
'Night.

129
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,657
ls that Charlie?

130
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,771
Yeah, he has a
big paper due tomorrow.

131
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,414
That picture he sent you is so hot.
He's totally ripped.

132
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:54,098
Sh. Shut up.
My mom.

133
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:58,731
I got donut holes.

134
00:10:58,811 --> 00:11:00,611
They're very
good. Here.

135
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,051
Who was that?

136
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:06,458
- It was Serena and Tanya.
- Oh.

137
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:08,298
Get anything good?

138
00:11:08,371 --> 00:11:09,495
Mm.

139
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:10,650
What?

140
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:13,935
She told me
to buy a bra.

141
00:11:14,011 --> 00:11:15,615
Oh, really?
Let me see.

142
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:19,979
Classy.

143
00:11:20,051 --> 00:11:24,056
- You saved the receipt though, right?
- Mom.

144
00:11:24,131 --> 00:11:26,095
If you think you're ready
for a bra like that

145
00:11:26,171 --> 00:11:28,091
then we'll talk
about it, okay?

146
00:11:28,171 --> 00:11:30,572
Serena kinda made
fun of her sports bra.

147
00:11:30,651 --> 00:11:34,459
- Why?
- 'Cause it totally, like, flattens out my boobs.

148
00:11:34,531 --> 00:11:36,692
She said that guys would
think that I was hotter

149
00:11:36,771 --> 00:11:38,659
if I, like,
had a better bra.

150
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:40,619
Does, like, Serena say
like all the time too?

151
00:11:40,691 --> 00:11:43,179
Because, like,
you never used to.

152
00:11:43,252 --> 00:11:45,336
Sorry.

153
00:11:45,412 --> 00:11:49,699
You don't have to dumb yourself
down for guys, like Serena.

154
00:11:49,771 --> 00:11:51,419
You know that.

155
00:11:51,491 --> 00:11:53,859
Maybe she thinks that's
all she's got to offer.

156
00:11:53,971 --> 00:11:56,459
Her parents own half of
downtown Chicago.

157
00:11:56,532 --> 00:11:57,820
You get my point
though, right?

158
00:11:57,892 --> 00:11:59,375
Yes, Lynn.

159
00:11:59,451 --> 00:12:02,899
It's a parking lot,
moron. Go around!

160
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,456
Did you get my point?

161
00:12:04,531 --> 00:12:05,939
Yeah, Mom. I get it.

162
00:12:06,012 --> 00:12:07,213
Oh, for the love of--

163
00:12:07,292 --> 00:12:09,736
- Bite me!
- Mom!

164
00:12:09,852 --> 00:12:12,417
Yeah, I'm gonna get the steak sandwich,
medium, with grilled onions.

165
00:12:12,492 --> 00:12:13,616
And can I get a side
of chips, please?

166
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:15,100
Oh, I'm sorry, we don't--

167
00:12:15,172 --> 00:12:16,940
He means French fries.

168
00:12:17,012 --> 00:12:19,456
Twenty years here, he still
can't say French fries.

169
00:12:19,532 --> 00:12:22,413
I'm gonna have the same thing,
actually, except rare on the steak.

170
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,379
And to drink,
we'll have a bottle of--

171
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,532
Really?

172
00:12:25,613 --> 00:12:27,457
'92 Rothschild.

173
00:12:27,533 --> 00:12:29,180
Fantastic selection.

174
00:12:29,252 --> 00:12:31,096
So what are
we celebrating?

175
00:12:31,212 --> 00:12:33,057
So A & A wants to use us.
For everything.

176
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:35,217
- They liked the campaign?
- Liked?

177
00:12:35,292 --> 00:12:37,137
How 'bout I just got a
phone call from the CEO

178
00:12:37,212 --> 00:12:41,293
that was basically
ten minutes of phone sex.

179
00:12:41,373 --> 00:12:43,097
Hey, let me
ask you something.

180
00:12:43,173 --> 00:12:44,461
How old are you?

181
00:12:44,533 --> 00:12:45,657
- Old enough.
- Oh.

182
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:47,380
I'm Claire, by the way.

183
00:12:47,452 --> 00:12:48,532
Hi, Claire. I'm Al.

184
00:12:48,613 --> 00:12:51,220
- That's Will.
- Hi.

185
00:12:51,292 --> 00:12:53,093
Please let me know if there's
anything else you need.

186
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:54,177
Anything?

187
00:12:55,933 --> 00:12:57,581
Can you stop?
She's nineteen.

188
00:12:57,653 --> 00:12:59,017
One hour.
That's all I ask.

189
00:12:59,093 --> 00:13:00,534
Just one hour
with that ass.

190
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,497
How's Barbara ?

191
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:02,620
Oh, fuck off.

192
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:16,857
That is so weird.

193
00:13:16,933 --> 00:13:20,141
Peter and I were just doing exactly
the same thing in his room.

194
00:13:20,214 --> 00:13:21,818
Ah, Dad.

195
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:36,414
Okay. What now?

196
00:13:43,934 --> 00:13:46,783
What? How old
are you?

197
00:13:55,214 --> 00:13:56,697
Why do you keep lying?

198
00:13:56,774 --> 00:13:58,738
What?

199
00:14:01,055 --> 00:14:03,215
Why do you keep
lying to me?

200
00:14:03,334 --> 00:14:05,254
Man, you won't believe
the stuff I'm Finding in here.

201
00:14:05,335 --> 00:14:07,975
I'll say.
You wanna keep these Playboys?

202
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,299
What?

203
00:14:09,374 --> 00:14:10,662
Just kidding.

204
00:14:10,734 --> 00:14:12,775
Oh. Yeah, me too.

205
00:14:12,855 --> 00:14:15,135
What, you packed
'em already?

206
00:14:15,215 --> 00:14:16,939
Yeah, kinda.

207
00:14:22,815 --> 00:14:24,298
You all right with this?

208
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:25,619
With What?

209
00:14:25,695 --> 00:14:27,659
The whole college thing.

210
00:14:27,735 --> 00:14:28,782
Yeah, I guess.

211
00:14:28,855 --> 00:14:30,295
Don't feel pressured

212
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,775
into doing things
you don't want to do.

213
00:14:32,855 --> 00:14:36,576
Wait. This isn't another
father-son talk, is it?

214
00:14:36,655 --> 00:14:39,656
Oh, Dad, we had the sex talk,
like, three years ago

215
00:14:39,735 --> 00:14:41,983
and I still can't order a salad
with cucumbers in it.

216
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:44,423
I just don't want you to lose
sight of what's important, like--

217
00:14:44,495 --> 00:14:47,223
Taking responsibility
for my actions

218
00:14:47,296 --> 00:14:50,416
living up to my potential
and personal expectations

219
00:14:50,495 --> 00:14:53,900
staying true to my beliefs.
Basically, being a man?

220
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,820
Something like that.

221
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:59,180
Relax, Pop.
I got this. Trust me.

222
00:14:59,255 --> 00:15:02,900
God. Come on.
Let's hug it out.

223
00:15:18,296 --> 00:15:20,064
I feel the same way.

224
00:15:21,736 --> 00:15:24,016
You coming in, sweetheart?
It's getting cold.

225
00:15:24,096 --> 00:15:25,416
Hold on a sec.

226
00:15:25,496 --> 00:15:27,056
Um, I'm talking
to Brittany, Dad.

227
00:15:27,136 --> 00:15:28,140
Two minutes.

228
00:15:28,216 --> 00:15:29,624
Okay. Now go away.

229
00:15:33,256 --> 00:15:34,544
Hi.

230
00:15:34,617 --> 00:15:37,585
How do I know that?

231
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:46,744
Okay.

232
00:15:46,817 --> 00:15:50,342
Well, are you
still a virgin?

233
00:15:53,897 --> 00:15:56,778
Good, 'cause that would
have been creepy.

234
00:15:59,657 --> 00:16:02,418
So, um, how old
were you when you--?

235
00:16:02,497 --> 00:16:03,697
Did you set the alarm?

236
00:16:03,777 --> 00:16:06,505
Force Held activated.

237
00:16:06,577 --> 00:16:08,138
Is Annie upstairs?

238
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,466
She's in her room.
Peter's still out.

239
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:11,585
Amen to that.

240
00:16:11,657 --> 00:16:12,901
You heartless witch.

241
00:16:12,977 --> 00:16:14,385
What?

242
00:16:14,457 --> 00:16:16,377
You're happy he's
going, aren't you?

243
00:16:16,457 --> 00:16:20,265
Two words for you.
Home gym.

244
00:16:22,618 --> 00:16:25,783
His room's gonna look great
with a treadmill in it.

245
00:16:28,937 --> 00:16:32,658
Our poor kid is barely packed and
you're already redecorating.

246
00:16:32,738 --> 00:16:37,103
What can I say?
Except--good riddance!

247
00:16:51,058 --> 00:16:52,422
Fuck.

248
00:16:52,498 --> 00:16:55,259
Oh, for God's--

249
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:00,906
They're in their room.

250
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:06,784
Right now?
Just a T-shirt and some underwear.

251
00:17:09,899 --> 00:17:12,506
No. With just the T-shirt.

252
00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:20,783
Okay.

253
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,263
Okay, it's dark now.

254
00:17:30,219 --> 00:17:32,227
Oh, I guess. What is it?

255
00:17:37,739 --> 00:17:39,180
No.

256
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,020
Okay.

257
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:55,340
Is that everything?

258
00:17:55,419 --> 00:17:56,827
Yeah.

259
00:17:56,899 --> 00:17:58,307
Katie, come
give me a hug.

260
00:17:58,379 --> 00:17:59,667
No.
I don't want you to go.

261
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,461
So, I guess I'm gonna
go to college now.

262
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,981
I love you.
Email me, okay?

263
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,588
Okay. Hey,
and check my tweets.

264
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,504
Okay, we gotta go, guys.

265
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,901
We'll see you later.

266
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:27,024
Bye. Bye, angel. Bye.

267
00:19:05,941 --> 00:19:08,102
Hi. Uh, it's me again.

268
00:19:08,181 --> 00:19:10,625
Where are you? I'm sitting
on the bench just outside.

269
00:19:10,701 --> 00:19:11,748
Annie ?

270
00:19:11,821 --> 00:19:13,349
Yes?

271
00:19:13,421 --> 00:19:15,745
It's me. Charlie.

272
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,502
Hey, you.

273
00:19:17,581 --> 00:19:21,990
God, I can't believe
it's really you.

274
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:25,105
Look at you.
You're gorgeous.

275
00:19:25,181 --> 00:19:27,385
Is this a joke?

276
00:19:27,462 --> 00:19:29,109
What?

277
00:19:29,181 --> 00:19:32,030
No, it's me, Charlie.

278
00:19:32,102 --> 00:19:34,230
What's wrong?

279
00:19:36,222 --> 00:19:37,269
You're not 25.

280
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:41,751
Oh. Well, hey.

281
00:19:41,822 --> 00:19:44,626
Don't get upset.

282
00:19:44,702 --> 00:19:46,065
Annie, please.

283
00:19:46,142 --> 00:19:48,183
Just give me
a chance to explain.

284
00:19:48,262 --> 00:19:51,666
It's me, Charlie.

285
00:19:51,742 --> 00:19:53,030
I'm sorry, I, but--

286
00:19:53,102 --> 00:19:55,590
Okay, all right.
You're right.

287
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:57,386
I just couldn't think
of a way to tell you.

288
00:19:57,462 --> 00:20:00,146
You have to believe me.

289
00:20:00,222 --> 00:20:03,507
Annie, please. Please?

290
00:20:03,582 --> 00:20:06,942
Don't get upset.
You're killing me here.

291
00:20:07,022 --> 00:20:12,391
Annie? It's
still me. Okay?

292
00:20:12,463 --> 00:20:15,791
Forget the age thing.
All that stuff that we talked about?

293
00:20:15,863 --> 00:20:18,951
All the things that we shared?
It's me. Charlie.

294
00:20:19,023 --> 00:20:22,263
I'm sitting right
here next to you.

295
00:20:22,343 --> 00:20:25,431
Why do you keep
lying to me?

296
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:29,107
Because of this.

297
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:32,544
I was,
I was afraid

298
00:20:32,623 --> 00:20:37,272
that you wouldn't be mature
enough to understand.

299
00:20:37,343 --> 00:20:42,984
Annie, when you connect with
someone the way that we connected

300
00:20:43,063 --> 00:20:48,432
when you find a soul mate the
way that we found each other

301
00:20:48,503 --> 00:20:51,547
then nothing else matters.

302
00:20:51,623 --> 00:20:54,744
I thought you were old
enough to understand that.

303
00:20:54,824 --> 00:20:58,108
I mean, you made me think you
could handle this, Annie.

304
00:21:01,743 --> 00:21:03,947
I mean, this
is ridiculous.

305
00:21:04,024 --> 00:21:06,152
I mean,
it's me, Charlie.

306
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:09,705
The same guy that you've been talking
to every day and every night

307
00:21:09,784 --> 00:21:12,511
for the last
two months.

308
00:21:14,424 --> 00:21:15,984
I love you.

309
00:21:17,824 --> 00:21:20,551
Annie.

310
00:21:20,624 --> 00:21:24,792
And I don't get why age
has to change that.

311
00:21:26,584 --> 00:21:29,672
Can we just
walk a bit? Huh?

312
00:21:29,744 --> 00:21:30,988
Talk a little bit more.

313
00:21:31,065 --> 00:21:32,712
Just for a couple
of minutes

314
00:21:32,784 --> 00:21:38,230
before I have my long drive
back to the airport?

315
00:21:38,304 --> 00:21:40,869
Come on. Just--

316
00:21:40,944 --> 00:21:45,505
I was just looking forward
to seeing you so much.

317
00:21:45,585 --> 00:21:48,870
I thought we were
friends at least, Annie.

318
00:22:03,024 --> 00:22:04,792
This remind you
of anything?

319
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:08,913
I was just thinking that.
Your year abroad in London.

320
00:22:08,985 --> 00:22:12,270
All these American students come in.
I saw this girl.

321
00:22:12,345 --> 00:22:14,626
Love at first sight.

322
00:22:14,705 --> 00:22:17,509
Didn't work out.
I ended up with you.

323
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,586
There.

324
00:22:28,825 --> 00:22:31,826
Sorry.

325
00:22:31,906 --> 00:22:33,553
Go ahead, spin it.

326
00:22:36,945 --> 00:22:42,194
The candy's weird.
It's better without it.

327
00:22:42,265 --> 00:22:43,509
Can I have some of yours?

328
00:22:50,386 --> 00:22:53,190
Oh.

329
00:22:53,266 --> 00:22:58,395
Yeah. You win.
Pistachio rocks.

330
00:22:58,466 --> 00:23:01,270
So Peter
took off, huh?

331
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:02,666
You must be
so excited.

332
00:23:02,746 --> 00:23:05,191
Yeah, I'm happy
for him.

333
00:23:05,266 --> 00:23:07,034
I'm just gonna miss
him, that's all.

334
00:23:07,106 --> 00:23:08,830
I just hope he doesn't
get caught up

335
00:23:08,906 --> 00:23:10,914
into that whole
fraternity rush thing.

336
00:23:10,986 --> 00:23:12,831
Sounds so stupid.

337
00:23:12,906 --> 00:23:15,351
Yeah, there's definitely some
stupid stuff involved, but

338
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:17,107
I have to say
I was a Delt

339
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:19,674
and there were some great
things about it, too.

340
00:23:19,746 --> 00:23:23,587
I met some, some quality guys that
I hope will be friends for life.

341
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:27,311
Yeah, I just, when he drinks
he kind of loses control.

342
00:23:27,386 --> 00:23:31,828
This one time he tried to text
me the sound of him vomiting.

343
00:23:31,906 --> 00:23:35,354
It's kind of tough to spell.

344
00:23:35,427 --> 00:23:37,947
it's kind of--
I, I don't know.

345
00:23:38,027 --> 00:23:41,791
It's like, "UG,"
I don't know. But...

346
00:23:41,867 --> 00:23:46,396
I just hope he doesn't just
do it to party and get laid.

347
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:49,315
But, yeah, I guess that's
what college is for, right?

348
00:23:49,387 --> 00:23:52,956
Finding out for yourself,
finding out who you are.

349
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:57,027
What?

350
00:23:57,108 --> 00:23:58,875
Nothing.

351
00:23:58,947 --> 00:24:00,475
It's just

352
00:24:00,548 --> 00:24:03,429
you amaze me.
Seriously.

353
00:24:03,507 --> 00:24:07,348
You're so intelligent
and sensitive, like

354
00:24:07,427 --> 00:24:09,435
wise beyond your years.

355
00:24:09,507 --> 00:24:13,109
It's just amazing,
that's all.

356
00:24:15,428 --> 00:24:17,348
Hey.

357
00:24:17,427 --> 00:24:20,668
Want me to teach you the
secret Delt handshake?

358
00:24:20,748 --> 00:24:23,148
Okay.

359
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:24,516
You can't
tell anyone.

360
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:25,667
I won't.

361
00:24:25,748 --> 00:24:26,828
Okay.

362
00:24:26,908 --> 00:24:28,348
Stick out your hand

363
00:24:28,428 --> 00:24:29,955
like you're
gonna shake mine.

364
00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:41,672
So--

365
00:24:43,189 --> 00:24:44,629
So.

366
00:24:45,908 --> 00:24:48,396
You still mad at me?

367
00:24:48,468 --> 00:24:50,477
No, not really.

368
00:24:54,709 --> 00:24:56,476
Wanna check out
your present?

369
00:24:56,548 --> 00:24:58,229
Oh, yeah.

370
00:25:02,988 --> 00:25:06,393
You said you'd want
one in red, so--

371
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:10,909
It's sexy, right?

372
00:25:10,989 --> 00:25:15,037
I can't tell you how many times
I've thought about you in it.

373
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:22,230
It's crazy, I'm so
nervous and excited

374
00:25:22,309 --> 00:25:26,554
to be sitting here with you
finally after all this time.

375
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:29,472
There.

376
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,751
Happy?

377
00:26:33,951 --> 00:26:37,759
You look
ridiculously sexy.

378
00:26:37,831 --> 00:26:40,592
No, don't go.

379
00:26:40,671 --> 00:26:42,231
I'm serious.

380
00:26:44,031 --> 00:26:45,395
Come here.

381
00:26:48,031 --> 00:26:49,471
Come sit down.

382
00:27:01,312 --> 00:27:03,832
Have you thought
about us like this?

383
00:27:06,512 --> 00:27:10,396
I know you have because you
told me about it, didn't you?

384
00:27:13,752 --> 00:27:16,992
You don't think
my body's weird?

385
00:27:17,072 --> 00:27:19,440
Are you kidding?

386
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:23,440
You're,
you're gorgeous.

387
00:27:26,632 --> 00:27:31,597
So you're not--
disappointed or anything?

388
00:27:31,672 --> 00:27:35,240
Annie. Annie.

389
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:40,512
You're perfect.

390
00:27:43,792 --> 00:27:46,313
You take
my breath away.

391
00:27:56,673 --> 00:27:58,713
Can I just--?

392
00:28:13,113 --> 00:28:15,513
No, wait, Charlie, wait.
Hold on.

393
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:17,677
It's okay.

394
00:28:17,753 --> 00:28:18,680
Charlie--

395
00:28:18,753 --> 00:28:21,034
It's okay.

396
00:28:21,113 --> 00:28:22,641
Charlie, wait.

397
00:28:26,953 --> 00:28:28,361
Charlie.

398
00:28:55,914 --> 00:28:59,122
It's okay, Annie.
Don't worry.

399
00:29:03,034 --> 00:29:05,162
I'm just
taking these off

400
00:29:09,434 --> 00:29:12,555
Oh. Hold still, Annie.
I've gotta take these off too.

401
00:29:15,034 --> 00:29:17,238
That's my girl.

402
00:29:18,754 --> 00:29:21,122
Oh, God.
Look at you.

403
00:29:27,834 --> 00:29:30,442
This is perfect.

404
00:29:42,074 --> 00:29:44,715
How about the boys in class?

405
00:29:44,794 --> 00:29:45,962
They 're okay.

406
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,075
Are they?

407
00:29:48,155 --> 00:29:51,156
Um, we're making
bowls in pottery class, but

408
00:29:51,235 --> 00:29:53,603
mine looks like
an ashtray

409
00:29:53,675 --> 00:29:56,196
which is kind of funny
because I don't smoke.

410
00:29:57,595 --> 00:29:59,319
Nice.

411
00:29:59,395 --> 00:30:02,396
How 'bout you, Annie?
How's school?

412
00:30:02,476 --> 00:30:03,480
Annie.

413
00:30:03,556 --> 00:30:04,844
Hm ?

414
00:30:04,915 --> 00:30:08,320
School.
How is it?

415
00:30:08,395 --> 00:30:10,403
Annie ?

416
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:25,239
He's so cute.

417
00:30:25,316 --> 00:30:26,604
I know.

418
00:30:26,676 --> 00:30:28,159
You should
go out with him.

419
00:30:28,236 --> 00:30:29,644
Did you get my text?

420
00:30:29,716 --> 00:30:30,960
Mm-hm.

421
00:30:31,036 --> 00:30:32,956
Why didn't you
call me back?

422
00:30:33,036 --> 00:30:35,840
Check it out, Annie.
Your boyfriend.

423
00:30:35,916 --> 00:30:37,444
OW!

424
00:30:37,516 --> 00:30:39,644
I told you before.
He's not my boyfriend.

425
00:30:39,756 --> 00:30:41,481
You keep saying that.
Makes me think you like him.

426
00:30:41,556 --> 00:30:43,237
If you're so obsessed
with him, why you fuck him?

427
00:30:43,316 --> 00:30:45,357
- What's your problem?
- Yeah? He's cute!

428
00:30:48,356 --> 00:30:52,765
Pick up, please pick up.

429
00:30:52,836 --> 00:30:57,757
Is this about Charlie?

430
00:30:57,837 --> 00:30:59,125
No. No.

431
00:30:59,196 --> 00:31:00,844
Annie, what happened?

432
00:31:00,916 --> 00:31:03,284
That was him
at the mall, wasn't it?

433
00:31:03,357 --> 00:31:04,361
How old is he?

434
00:31:04,437 --> 00:31:05,561
It doesn't matter.

435
00:31:05,637 --> 00:31:06,761
Annie, wait.

436
00:31:10,116 --> 00:31:11,480
Oh, my God.

437
00:31:13,877 --> 00:31:15,437
It 's not
that big a deal.

438
00:31:15,517 --> 00:31:17,841
We me! up on Saturday.
We had sex.

439
00:31:19,637 --> 00:31:20,838
We're in love.

440
00:31:20,917 --> 00:31:22,358
Oh, my God.

441
00:31:22,437 --> 00:31:25,002
Now just drop it.
I'm serious.

442
00:31:26,597 --> 00:31:28,561
The word ciao

443
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:32,118
comes from schiavo,
or servant, and was used as--

444
00:31:32,197 --> 00:31:33,921
Sorry to interrupt, uh

445
00:31:33,997 --> 00:31:36,725
mind if I borrow Annie
Cameron for a second?

446
00:31:36,797 --> 00:31:39,438
Ms.
Worley, why are we going this way?

447
00:31:39,517 --> 00:31:42,245
Oh, it's all right,
Annie. Come on in.

448
00:31:46,158 --> 00:31:48,002
Why don't you
have a seat?

449
00:31:55,397 --> 00:31:56,565
I know, yeah.

450
00:31:56,638 --> 00:31:58,678
Holy shit!
Dude, dude.

451
00:32:12,718 --> 00:32:16,166
No, it's Antigua.
Anguilla is a totally different island.

452
00:32:16,238 --> 00:32:18,038
Honestly, I was hoping
to get the crew

453
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:19,963
and the equipment
in the same place.

454
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:21,926
Yeah. Hang on.
Hang on just a second.

455
00:32:21,998 --> 00:32:24,126
Hello. Speaking.

456
00:32:25,678 --> 00:32:28,166
Sorry, I,
I don't understand.

457
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:30,966
Will. Will!

458
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:33,199
What happened?

459
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:35,283
They won't tell me anything.
I just, I just! got here, and I--

460
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:37,039
Excuse me. Annie Cameron.
We're the parents.

461
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:38,198
Let me find
the nurse.

462
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:39,359
Mr. and Mrs. Cameron?

463
00:32:39,439 --> 00:32:41,206
I'm Officer Gomez.

464
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,079
Your daughter wants you to
know that she's okay, but

465
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:44,360
maybe you should
have a seat.

466
00:32:44,439 --> 00:32:45,967
- What's going on?
- What?

467
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:47,119
We don't know exactly
what's happened.

468
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:48,562
What we do know so far

469
00:32:48,639 --> 00:32:50,123
is that we think
she was assaulted

470
00:32:50,199 --> 00:32:51,683
by her alleged
boyfriend three days ago.

471
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:53,003
She hasn't
got a boyfriend.

472
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:54,520
Well, apparently
on Saturday

473
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:56,444
she met up with a man
she calls Charlie

474
00:32:56,519 --> 00:32:59,040
at a motel, where she
was sexually assaulted.

475
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:01,640
The man is at least
35 years old.

476
00:33:01,719 --> 00:33:03,127
Jesus Christ.
Where is she?

477
00:33:03,199 --> 00:33:05,119
She's in an exam room
with the nurse

478
00:33:05,199 --> 00:33:07,207
collecting evidence for the rape kit.
She's okay.

479
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,283
One of the counselors from
the hospital is with her.

480
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:10,246
I have to see her.

481
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:11,967
Look, there is a private waiting
room just down the hall--

482
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:13,327
We have to see her
right now!

483
00:33:13,399 --> 00:33:15,363
We want to see
her right now.

484
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,888
She's having an exam.
You'll see her in a minute.

485
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,408
I'm almost done.

486
00:33:35,479 --> 00:33:38,000
I just need to get one more
picture of that abrasion.

487
00:33:40,959 --> 00:33:43,404
This is fucking insane.

488
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,001
On, baby.

489
00:33:58,081 --> 00:34:02,565
It's okay. We're here.
We're here now.

490
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,604
Mr. and Mrs. Cameron,
I'm Gail Friedman.

491
00:34:04,681 --> 00:34:05,805
I'm a counselor
with the hospital.

492
00:34:05,881 --> 00:34:07,605
I'm glad
you're here.

493
00:34:07,681 --> 00:34:09,722
- Annie here is an amazing young woman.
- Gail.

494
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,041
- Ah. This is Special Agent Doug Tate with the FBI.
- Hi.

495
00:34:13,121 --> 00:34:14,725
FBI?

496
00:34:14,801 --> 00:34:16,165
Well, any time
a crime is committed

497
00:34:16,241 --> 00:34:17,724
against a child
using the Internet

498
00:34:17,801 --> 00:34:19,405
and the suspect
is a traveler

499
00:34:19,481 --> 00:34:22,209
someone from out of
state, they call us in.

500
00:34:22,281 --> 00:34:24,289
Look, Annie, I know
you've had a rough day.

501
00:34:24,361 --> 00:34:26,685
But I need to ask you a couple of questions.
You feel up for it?

502
00:34:26,761 --> 00:34:28,965
Do we have
to do this now?

503
00:34:29,041 --> 00:34:31,005
Trust me, the sooner we start
this investigation, the better.

504
00:34:31,081 --> 00:34:32,641
Gail, do we still have the clothes
she was wearing that night?

505
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:34,042
- Yes.
- Are they here?

506
00:34:34,121 --> 00:34:35,921
No, they're
at her house.

507
00:34:36,001 --> 00:34:37,921
Okay, I need to get those
from you as soon as possible.

508
00:34:38,002 --> 00:34:39,082
Is that okay?

509
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:40,449
Yeah, I guess.

510
00:34:40,521 --> 00:34:42,441
Mr. Cameron,
Mrs. Cameron

511
00:34:42,522 --> 00:34:44,966
I would like to talk to Annie alone.
Could you please just--

512
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,569
Look, I've had
enough of this.

513
00:34:46,642 --> 00:34:48,562
This is our daughter.
We wanna be with her.

514
00:34:48,641 --> 00:34:50,682
You've got to
understand that right now

515
00:34:50,801 --> 00:34:52,601
Annie's a victim of a crime and you
and your wife are just witnesses.

516
00:34:52,682 --> 00:34:54,690
That's why we interview
everybody separately

517
00:34:54,761 --> 00:34:56,802
so as not to contaminate
anyone's testimony.

518
00:34:56,882 --> 00:34:58,322
Now if you can just give
Annie and I a second alone

519
00:34:58,402 --> 00:34:59,766
and then I'll come
back to your house

520
00:34:59,841 --> 00:35:01,850
and we can all
sit down and talk.

521
00:35:01,922 --> 00:35:03,046
Fair enough?

522
00:35:11,882 --> 00:35:14,250
So how long
will this take ?

523
00:35:14,322 --> 00:35:17,410
Well, it depends if we get enough
genetic material to run a profile.

524
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:18,966
And if there is,
how long?

525
00:35:19,042 --> 00:35:21,006
Right now, there's
a nationwide backlog.

526
00:35:21,082 --> 00:35:23,450
In Illinois alone, we've
got 2,000 unopened kits

527
00:35:23,523 --> 00:35:24,930
sitting in freezers
waiting to be processed.

528
00:35:25,002 --> 00:35:26,366
Some people have been
waiting a year.

529
00:35:26,442 --> 00:35:28,209
- What? - How is that possible?

530
00:35:28,282 --> 00:35:29,963
We'll run this through
the FBI facilities.

531
00:35:30,042 --> 00:35:31,363
So, two weeks,
a month on the outside.

532
00:35:31,442 --> 00:35:32,806
A month?

533
00:35:32,882 --> 00:35:36,571
Now can I see
the family computer?

534
00:35:36,642 --> 00:35:37,406
Doug.

535
00:35:37,483 --> 00:35:38,923
Yeah.

536
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:41,011
- Did you copy the hard drive?
- Yup.

537
00:35:41,083 --> 00:35:43,483
- We'll take that with the evidence down to the lab.
- Okay.

538
00:35:43,563 --> 00:35:45,004
Apart from Teen Chat

539
00:35:45,082 --> 00:35:46,643
were there any
other networking sites

540
00:35:46,722 --> 00:35:48,086
you used to communicate?

541
00:35:48,163 --> 00:35:49,571
No, not really.

542
00:35:49,643 --> 00:35:52,567
Did you guys ever
speak on the phone?

543
00:35:52,643 --> 00:35:54,443
You spoke to him.

544
00:35:54,523 --> 00:35:56,204
Now, you said
his mother was sick.

545
00:35:56,283 --> 00:35:57,211
Yeah. Cancer.

546
00:35:57,282 --> 00:35:58,930
Yeah, okay.

547
00:35:59,003 --> 00:36:00,531
Tell him you feel awful
about his mother

548
00:36:00,603 --> 00:36:02,207
that you really
wanna talk to him

549
00:36:02,283 --> 00:36:04,531
that you lost
an uncle to cancer.

550
00:36:04,603 --> 00:36:05,650
I-I don't know.

551
00:36:05,723 --> 00:36:08,451
You don't know what?

552
00:36:08,524 --> 00:36:10,565
I just don't
wanna lie to him.

553
00:36:10,643 --> 00:36:13,611
What are you talking about,
sweetheart? He lied to you.

554
00:36:13,683 --> 00:36:15,931
What do you think
of writing to him

555
00:36:16,003 --> 00:36:18,852
and just telling him
how you feel?

556
00:36:18,924 --> 00:36:21,531
Yeah, Annie.
Would that be good?

557
00:36:21,603 --> 00:36:23,164
Yeah, I guess.

558
00:36:23,243 --> 00:36:25,163
Okay, good.

559
00:36:25,244 --> 00:36:26,772
Okay, just keep
if simple- Be yourself

560
00:36:35,163 --> 00:36:36,484
Maybe he didn't
even like me.

561
00:36:36,564 --> 00:36:37,644
He didn't.

562
00:36:37,724 --> 00:36:39,492
Will!

563
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:41,812
it wasn't like
that, sweetheart.

564
00:36:41,884 --> 00:36:43,804
The man tricked you.

565
00:36:44,964 --> 00:36:46,492
What?

566
00:36:48,044 --> 00:36:49,844
- Is that him?
- Charlie.

567
00:36:49,924 --> 00:36:51,692
Okay, now, remember,
he's gonna test you

568
00:36:51,764 --> 00:36:53,204
to see if you told anybody.
You haven't, okay?

569
00:36:53,284 --> 00:36:55,008
Tell him that
you're concerned

570
00:36:55,084 --> 00:36:56,809
and a little worried that
he hasn't called. Okay?

571
00:36:56,884 --> 00:36:58,051
Should I?

572
00:36:58,124 --> 00:36:59,368
Yeah, answer
him. Yeah.

573
00:37:03,044 --> 00:37:04,485
A-are, are you
guys tracing this?

574
00:37:05,405 --> 00:37:06,693
Yes.

575
00:37:14,325 --> 00:37:15,733
It says private.
What do I do to answer it?

576
00:37:15,805 --> 00:37:17,213
Frank, are we good?

577
00:37:17,285 --> 00:37:20,012
We're good.

578
00:37:20,085 --> 00:37:22,693
Annie? Look at me?
Just, just talk to him.

579
00:37:22,765 --> 00:37:23,485
All right?

580
00:37:23,564 --> 00:37:24,885
Okay.

581
00:37:28,285 --> 00:37:29,889
Hello?

582
00:37:29,965 --> 00:37:31,733
Annie ?

583
00:37:31,805 --> 00:37:33,049
Charlie?

584
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:33,813
Hi.

585
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:35,926
Hi.

586
00:37:36,005 --> 00:37:39,170
It's kinda late.
Where are your parents?

587
00:37:40,806 --> 00:37:43,250
They took Katie
to the movies.

588
00:37:45,245 --> 00:37:47,526
Charlie?

589
00:37:56,525 --> 00:37:57,486
Shit.

590
00:38:00,406 --> 00:38:01,453
Shame on you, Annie.

591
00:38:01,526 --> 00:38:02,934
Charlie?

592
00:38:03,006 --> 00:38:03,813
Charlie, are
you there?

593
00:38:03,885 --> 00:38:04,693
Charlie?

594
00:38:04,766 --> 00:38:06,326
Damn it!

595
00:38:06,406 --> 00:38:09,210
Frank, did
we get it?

596
00:38:09,286 --> 00:38:11,774
Well, that's it.
He's gone.

597
00:38:11,846 --> 00:38:14,607
Why did you
make me do that?

598
00:38:14,686 --> 00:38:17,054
Annie!

599
00:38:17,126 --> 00:38:21,207
He probably got your
cell number off your website.

600
00:38:21,286 --> 00:38:23,773
Look, I'll
give you a call

601
00:38:23,846 --> 00:38:25,407
when I get back
from the motel.

602
00:38:25,486 --> 00:38:29,327
Tell me something.
Did she yell for help?

603
00:38:29,406 --> 00:38:32,090
I mean, did she scream,
tell him to stop?

604
00:38:32,166 --> 00:38:34,130
Just because she
didn't scream for help

605
00:38:34,206 --> 00:38:35,766
does not mean
this wasn't rape.

606
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:37,766
Now that guy is 20 years
older than she is.

607
00:38:37,847 --> 00:38:40,454
He groomed her for weeks just
to get her into the motel room

608
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:42,730
and she's armed with what?
The eighth-grade biology

609
00:38:42,807 --> 00:38:44,411
and the expectation that the
world is a decent place.

610
00:38:44,486 --> 00:38:46,406
I'm gonna fucking
kill this guy.

611
00:38:46,487 --> 00:38:48,528
No, you won't. That's why I'm here.
Now, we will find him.

612
00:38:48,606 --> 00:38:50,167
And what am I
supposed to do?

613
00:38:50,246 --> 00:38:51,490
You go back inside,
you support your daughter

614
00:38:51,567 --> 00:38:53,454
and you let us
do our job.

615
00:38:53,526 --> 00:38:55,850
What, with just five of you
guys working the whole state?

616
00:38:55,927 --> 00:38:57,847
There's gotta be something I can do.
I'm not just gonna stand around and wait--

617
00:38:57,927 --> 00:38:59,410
Mr. Cameron, I promise you.

618
00:38:59,487 --> 00:39:02,215
I put everything
I got into these cases.

619
00:39:02,287 --> 00:39:04,611
You just gotta
give us a chance.

620
00:39:06,527 --> 00:39:09,452
Now, my cell
is on the back.

621
00:39:09,527 --> 00:39:11,851
You call me
if you need anything.

622
00:39:11,927 --> 00:39:15,135
I'll drop you a line tomorrow
when I get back from the motel.

623
00:39:27,368 --> 00:39:30,489
You want me to
sleep with you tonight?

624
00:39:30,567 --> 00:39:33,568
No, I just want
my blanket.

625
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:46,289
No, please, stop.

626
00:40:48,809 --> 00:40:51,090
Stop, please!

627
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:53,931
Dad, please help me
to stop him.

628
00:40:55,209 --> 00:40:56,890
Please, Dad, help!

629
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:02,454
Help me!
No, get off!

630
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:06,054
Don't Please, Dad, help me, please.

631
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:10,731
Stop! No!

632
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:14,611
Will.

633
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:16,534
You all
right, buddy?

634
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:18,497
Yeah, of course.

635
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:21,494
If Mrs. Van Dersey
wants the meeting, fine.

636
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:24,451
But I think that we should
dictate the parameters.

637
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:25,893
No more of this bullshit.

638
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:28,415
Good.

639
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:30,257
Is there
any more coffee?

640
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:33,538
Grab another coffee.

641
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:37,299
Hey.
I got you a new cell.

642
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:40,694
Now, you have
to promise me

643
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:42,091
that you're not
gonna try and call him

644
00:41:42,171 --> 00:41:44,494
or text him
with this new number.

645
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:46,731
Remember what Tate
said about the old one

646
00:41:46,811 --> 00:41:48,939
that if he tries to call you on
that, you tell us immediately.

647
00:41:49,011 --> 00:41:50,735
I'm gonna have
to check the bills.

648
00:41:50,811 --> 00:41:53,779
And if I find out that
you've tried to contact him

649
00:41:53,851 --> 00:41:55,935
I'm gonna have
to take it back.

650
00:41:56,011 --> 00:41:57,615
Okay?

651
00:42:45,532 --> 00:42:48,260
So what? Do I just start
talking like Tony Soprano?

652
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:53,700
Boy, I hope not.

653
00:42:53,772 --> 00:42:57,057
I'm glad you came.

654
00:42:57,132 --> 00:42:59,216
Yeah, well, my parents
said I had to.

655
00:42:59,292 --> 00:43:01,812
Well, even so,
I'm still glad.

656
00:43:01,892 --> 00:43:03,300
I want this
to be a place

657
00:43:03,373 --> 00:43:04,900
for you to feel
safe and comfortable

658
00:43:04,972 --> 00:43:06,293
talking about anything.

659
00:43:06,372 --> 00:43:08,020
I just wanna
be helpful to you.

660
00:43:08,092 --> 00:43:10,012
You think
I need help?

661
00:43:10,093 --> 00:43:12,733
I think that what you've been
through must be very difficult.

662
00:43:12,813 --> 00:43:15,136
You know, what's
the big deal?

663
00:43:15,212 --> 00:43:16,773
There are girls
at my school

664
00:43:16,852 --> 00:43:19,417
who've had sex
with half the football team.

665
00:43:19,492 --> 00:43:20,780
I lose my virginity
and my parents

666
00:43:20,852 --> 00:43:22,413
make a federal case
out of it.

667
00:43:22,492 --> 00:43:23,780
Literally.

668
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:25,173
I think they're
more concerned

669
00:43:25,253 --> 00:43:26,377
that you may have
been in danger

670
00:43:26,452 --> 00:43:27,292
more than anything else.

671
00:43:27,373 --> 00:43:28,814
Danger?

672
00:43:28,893 --> 00:43:31,533
That's 'cause
they don't know him.

673
00:43:31,613 --> 00:43:33,577
You know,
the thing is

674
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:37,178
I bet my dad would
really like him

675
00:43:37,253 --> 00:43:40,538
if they'd met,
you know, before.

676
00:43:40,613 --> 00:43:43,221
What is it about him you think
your father would like ?

677
00:43:43,293 --> 00:43:48,575
He's sweet, and smart,
and really funny.

678
00:43:48,653 --> 00:43:51,534
And gives great advice and
which, by the way, worked.

679
00:43:51,613 --> 00:43:53,622
I-I made the team
because of him.

680
00:43:53,694 --> 00:43:55,418
You think that's the only
reason you made the team?

681
00:43:55,494 --> 00:43:59,215
Because of his advice,
and not your own ability?

682
00:43:59,294 --> 00:44:02,895
Well, he's older.
He's been playing longer.

683
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,938
What'd you think
about him being older?

684
00:44:05,013 --> 00:44:09,455
At first I thought
he was 16, okay?

685
00:44:09,533 --> 00:44:14,422
And then, all of a sudden
he's 20 and I'm like, what?

686
00:44:14,494 --> 00:44:16,774
And then we kept talking

687
00:44:16,854 --> 00:44:20,738
and I was, like,
what's the big deal?

688
00:44:20,814 --> 00:44:23,378
He gets me, you know?

689
00:44:23,454 --> 00:44:25,899
He's not judgmental.

690
00:44:25,974 --> 00:44:29,214
He's encouraging.

691
00:44:29,294 --> 00:44:33,582
And despite my age difference
he still loves me.

692
00:44:35,694 --> 00:44:38,334
And he thinks
I'm beautiful.

693
00:44:38,415 --> 00:44:40,095
What'd you think
about him

694
00:44:40,174 --> 00:44:42,902
not being honest
about his age?

695
00:44:42,974 --> 00:44:46,259
You know,
Charlie said that

696
00:44:46,335 --> 00:44:49,816
when you connect
like we did

697
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:53,703
when you find
that soul mate

698
00:44:53,775 --> 00:44:57,616
that's the only thing
to think about.

699
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:00,335
Don't you believe that when
two people are in love

700
00:45:00,415 --> 00:45:03,142
nothing else matters?

701
00:45:03,215 --> 00:45:05,823
I can understand how strong
those feelings are, Annie.

702
00:45:05,895 --> 00:45:09,736
But, there are reasons why
girls your age and men his

703
00:45:09,815 --> 00:45:11,420
aren't supposed
to be together.

704
00:45:11,495 --> 00:45:13,698
Whatever.

705
00:45:13,775 --> 00:45:18,184
He loves me.
I know he does.

706
00:45:18,255 --> 00:45:21,136
And he's dying
to call me or email me

707
00:45:21,216 --> 00:45:23,180
but he knows it's no! safe

708
00:45:23,256 --> 00:45:27,216
thanks to my parents
and the FBI.

709
00:45:27,295 --> 00:45:29,576
I just--

710
00:45:29,655 --> 00:45:33,300
What?

711
00:45:33,376 --> 00:45:35,624
I just hope he's okay.

712
00:45:38,776 --> 00:45:40,381
What, he go to lunch early?

713
00:45:40,455 --> 00:45:43,544
He went home.
Said he wasn't feeling well.

714
00:45:46,296 --> 00:45:47,463
Hello?

715
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:48,900
Will, it's Agent Tate.

716
00:45:48,976 --> 00:45:50,623
I wanted to give
you an update.

717
00:45:50,696 --> 00:45:53,261
Now, look, the motel
didn't give us much.

718
00:45:53,336 --> 00:45:54,940
He paid cash
for the room.

719
00:45:55,016 --> 00:45:57,024
He told the manager
he lost his wallet.

720
00:45:57,096 --> 00:45:59,104
He even ordered a credit
card right in front of him.

721
00:45:59,216 --> 00:46:01,943
The, uh, the cell phone was prepaid.
It was purchased in St. Louis.

722
00:46:02,016 --> 00:46:04,144
He paid cash for that,
too, whoever he is.

723
00:46:04,216 --> 00:46:05,537
So his name's not
Charles Hightower.

724
00:46:05,616 --> 00:46:07,297
Yeah, not that
we can tell.

725
00:46:07,376 --> 00:46:08,937
I found seven of them living
in the U.S. so far

726
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:11,100
but none of 'em
fit the description.

727
00:46:11,176 --> 00:46:13,380
There 's nothing that even
confirms he's from California

728
00:46:13,496 --> 00:46:15,340
we, uh, we actually traced his IP
address to the Czech Republic.

729
00:46:15,416 --> 00:46:17,096
What?

730
00:46:17,177 --> 00:46:19,501
It seems he's running some
sort of ghost program.

731
00:46:19,576 --> 00:46:21,421
It's a software
that basically bounces

732
00:46:21,496 --> 00:46:22,576
his IP address from
one server to another

733
00:46:22,657 --> 00:46:23,541
all over the world.

734
00:46:23,617 --> 00:46:24,784
Sir?

735
00:46:24,857 --> 00:46:25,904
Sorry, I don't understand.

736
00:46:25,976 --> 00:46:27,581
What does that mean?

737
00:46:27,657 --> 00:46:29,665
It means he's good
at what he's doing.

738
00:46:29,737 --> 00:46:32,061
But don't worry, don't worry.
This is exactly how it starts.

739
00:46:32,136 --> 00:46:33,500
You need to go on through,
go get your stuff.

740
00:46:33,577 --> 00:46:34,821
Yeah, one minute, please.

741
00:46:34,896 --> 00:46:36,064
What about the car?
Anything?

742
00:46:36,137 --> 00:46:37,981
Hang up the phone, sir.

743
00:46:38,057 --> 00:46:39,584
It was an airport rental.
He must've swapped the plates.

744
00:46:39,657 --> 00:46:41,425
Gary!

745
00:46:41,497 --> 00:46:42,741
Look, I'm, I'll have
to call you back. Okay?

746
00:46:42,817 --> 00:46:44,181
Seriously, is
my conversation

747
00:46:44,257 --> 00:46:46,057
that much of a threat
to security?

748
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:47,261
Thank you, sir.

749
00:46:52,577 --> 00:46:54,497
Is it over?

750
00:46:54,577 --> 00:46:56,706
Yeah, you missed
a pretty good fight.

751
00:46:56,777 --> 00:46:59,178
When they do Real
Housewives of Chicago

752
00:46:59,258 --> 00:47:00,818
I am so auditioning.

753
00:47:00,898 --> 00:47:03,026
Yeah, right.

754
00:47:06,057 --> 00:47:07,858
I talked to Jennie.

755
00:47:07,937 --> 00:47:10,382
Brittany's really upset
you won't call her back.

756
00:47:10,458 --> 00:47:11,941
Good.

757
00:47:13,898 --> 00:47:15,338
She was only
trying to help, honey.

758
00:47:15,418 --> 00:47:16,619
Yeah, well, she's a bitch.

759
00:47:16,698 --> 00:47:19,022
No, she's
your best friend.

760
00:47:19,098 --> 00:47:21,378
Best friends don't
narc on each other.

761
00:47:21,458 --> 00:47:23,345
Not like she'll ever
get a boyfriend

762
00:47:23,418 --> 00:47:26,026
but if she does, I hope someone
ruins it for her, too.

763
00:47:26,098 --> 00:47:27,419
Lynn ?

764
00:47:29,578 --> 00:47:31,303
Did you get my message?

765
00:47:31,378 --> 00:47:32,905
Yeah, I called
you back

766
00:47:32,978 --> 00:47:36,022
but it went to voice mail.
Did you eat?

767
00:47:36,098 --> 00:47:37,626
Have a look
at this a second.

768
00:47:37,698 --> 00:47:39,258
You won't believe this.

769
00:47:40,378 --> 00:47:41,939
What is this?

770
00:47:42,018 --> 00:47:45,226
This is the National
Sex Offenders Registry.

771
00:47:45,298 --> 00:47:49,063
There's perverts all over
Wilmette, not just Chicago.

772
00:47:50,898 --> 00:47:53,026
See this? All
these red dots.

773
00:47:53,098 --> 00:47:54,178
They're everywhere.

774
00:47:54,259 --> 00:47:57,107
Oh, my God.

775
00:47:57,178 --> 00:48:00,147
This guy here is literally
three blocks away on Linden.

776
00:48:00,218 --> 00:48:01,746
What's going on?

777
00:48:01,819 --> 00:48:04,668
Hi, sweetheart.
Um, come here a second.

778
00:48:04,739 --> 00:48:07,500
I, I need you to do
something for me.

779
00:48:14,899 --> 00:48:18,139
These men are all registered sex
offenders in the neighborhood

780
00:48:18,219 --> 00:48:19,540
that fit the description.

781
00:48:19,619 --> 00:48:21,147
I need you to look
through them.

782
00:48:21,219 --> 00:48:22,507
Why?

783
00:48:22,579 --> 00:48:24,020
In case one of them's Charlie.

784
00:48:24,099 --> 00:48:26,227
What?

785
00:48:26,299 --> 00:48:28,307
No. N-- No.

786
00:48:28,379 --> 00:48:31,827
Honey, you should.
One of them could be him.

787
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:48,464
None of them's him.

788
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:50,820
Forget the hair and the mustaches.
Just look at the face.

789
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:52,264
Could any
of them be him?

790
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:54,227
I said, no.

791
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:55,784
God, what's
your problem?

792
00:48:55,859 --> 00:48:57,464
My problem is you
were attacked.

793
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:59,220
It wasn't like that.

794
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:02,300
Besides, none of them
are Charlie, okay?

795
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:04,781
Are we done?

796
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:18,385
Pervert Tracker.
What is this?

797
00:49:18,461 --> 00:49:21,222
It's a group
I met with today.

798
00:49:21,341 --> 00:49:25,825
Supposed to be the best in the country.
They hunt predators.

799
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:28,508
Today? It says
they're in New Jersey.

800
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:33,265
You were in New Jersey today?

801
00:49:36,381 --> 00:49:38,541
You got on a plane today
without telling me?

802
00:49:38,621 --> 00:49:39,865
Are you fucking
kidding me ?

803
00:49:39,941 --> 00:49:41,708
I swear to God, Will

804
00:49:41,781 --> 00:49:44,105
if you ever get on a plane
again without telling me

805
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:46,145
I swear to God, I don't
know what I'd do.

806
00:49:46,221 --> 00:49:47,661
I'm sorry.

807
00:49:47,741 --> 00:49:51,222
Honey, you're right.
I'm sorry.

808
00:49:51,301 --> 00:49:53,701
I'm gonna go
check on her.

809
00:50:35,902 --> 00:50:38,586
I've gotta
get out of my house.

810
00:50:38,662 --> 00:50:41,390
How come? What's
happening at home?

811
00:50:41,462 --> 00:50:45,226
You know, they think I'm stupid
for meeting up with him.

812
00:50:45,302 --> 00:50:46,349
Going back to his hotel.

813
00:50:46,422 --> 00:50:48,626
They said that?

814
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:52,347
My dad looks at me
like I'm an idiot.

815
00:50:52,423 --> 00:50:55,751
He wants to kill Charlie.
That's all he talks about.

816
00:50:55,823 --> 00:50:57,547
Getting his hands on him.

817
00:50:57,623 --> 00:50:59,423
Well, what would you do if
he got in touch with you

818
00:50:59,503 --> 00:51:01,751
have you thought about what
you would say to him?

819
00:51:01,823 --> 00:51:05,467
I just wanna talk to him.
Hear his voice.

820
00:51:08,183 --> 00:51:11,904
See how his mom's doing,
and his little dog.

821
00:51:11,983 --> 00:51:15,704
See how we're gonna
make this work.

822
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:20,947
I just wanna talk to him
about what happened.

823
00:51:21,023 --> 00:51:23,391
We haven 'I really
talked about that

824
00:51:23,463 --> 00:51:27,992
about what happened
in the motel.

825
00:51:28,063 --> 00:51:30,072
Are we supposed to?

826
00:51:30,144 --> 00:51:33,548
In my experience,
it helps. It really does.

827
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:35,348
But only if you're ready.

828
00:51:45,224 --> 00:51:47,985
It 's kind of weird,
you know.

829
00:51:52,783 --> 00:51:56,188
Like it wasn't really
happening to me.

830
00:52:00,344 --> 00:52:03,552
Like I was watching it
from above.

831
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:12,666
Sometimes when you can't
physically escape from a situation

832
00:52:12,744 --> 00:52:16,433
where you feel frightened
or threatened

833
00:52:16,504 --> 00:52:22,265
you find a way to remove or
distance yourself psychologically.

834
00:52:22,344 --> 00:52:25,705
It's a way
of protecting yourself.

835
00:52:25,785 --> 00:52:28,229
Does that make sense?

836
00:52:31,145 --> 00:52:32,553
Still have ten minutes.

837
00:52:32,625 --> 00:52:34,873
Yeah, well.
I'll see you later.

838
00:52:34,945 --> 00:52:37,313
Chicago has a very
strong sense of history.

839
00:52:37,384 --> 00:52:39,588
Kinda like when they bought Marshall
Fields, turned it into a Macy's.

840
00:52:39,665 --> 00:52:41,345
They lost half
their client base.

841
00:52:41,425 --> 00:52:43,225
It's a fine line.
You want a fresh look

842
00:52:43,305 --> 00:52:45,029
but you don't want to alienate
your loyal customers.

843
00:52:45,105 --> 00:52:46,469
We loved what you
did with A & A

844
00:52:46,544 --> 00:52:48,105
particularly
in the tween market.

845
00:52:48,184 --> 00:52:49,625
Well, that was mostly
Will's work here.

846
00:52:49,705 --> 00:52:51,145
Well, I don't know
if that's true

847
00:52:51,225 --> 00:52:53,625
but I'm very happy
to take the credit.

848
00:53:00,145 --> 00:53:01,192
Rebecca?

849
00:53:01,265 --> 00:53:02,466
Becky.

850
00:53:02,545 --> 00:53:03,266
Jerry?

851
00:53:03,345 --> 00:53:04,185
Yeah.

852
00:53:04,265 --> 00:53:05,586
Hi, Jerry.

853
00:53:05,665 --> 00:53:08,153
Look at you.
You're gorgeous.

854
00:53:08,225 --> 00:53:10,069
You really think so ?

855
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:13,714
Yeah. Can't believe it's you.

856
00:53:13,786 --> 00:53:15,269
Did you bring
your stuff?

857
00:53:15,345 --> 00:53:19,273
Uh--

858
00:53:19,345 --> 00:53:20,906
Fuck!

859
00:53:20,985 --> 00:53:22,229
Hey! Hey! Stop! FBI!

860
00:53:22,306 --> 00:53:27,151
Hey, get that guy!

861
00:53:27,226 --> 00:53:30,074
Go, guys, get him, get him!
Come on!

862
00:53:30,146 --> 00:53:30,910
Hey!

863
00:53:33,026 --> 00:53:34,554
Actually, there's
a lot of similarities

864
00:53:34,626 --> 00:53:36,590
between your company
and Academic Appeal.

865
00:53:36,666 --> 00:53:39,231
It's just you have a much more
sophisticated client base.

866
00:53:39,306 --> 00:53:41,914
Everybody wants to broaden
their consumer appeal

867
00:53:41,986 --> 00:53:43,666
especially in the tween market.

868
00:53:43,746 --> 00:53:46,594
I mean, it's like
the Holy Grail of--

869
00:53:46,666 --> 00:53:50,911
Sorry, would you just
excuse me a minute?

870
00:53:50,987 --> 00:53:53,431
Look, I'm
really sorry, Will.

871
00:53:53,506 --> 00:53:55,951
So what made you think
he was our guy?

872
00:53:56,027 --> 00:53:58,547
The program he was running
to scatter his IP address

873
00:53:58,627 --> 00:54:00,067
the chat rooms he used.

874
00:54:00,147 --> 00:54:01,271
Mostly, Will, it was
his conversation.

875
00:54:01,346 --> 00:54:03,114
It was the way he spoke.

876
00:54:03,187 --> 00:54:04,867
It was very similar
to the way Charlie chatted.

877
00:54:04,947 --> 00:54:06,911
How do you know that?

878
00:54:06,987 --> 00:54:09,071
I was able to get transcripts
of two months worth of IM chats

879
00:54:09,147 --> 00:54:11,514
between him and your
daughter from Teen Chat.

880
00:54:11,586 --> 00:54:12,514
You're kidding.

881
00:54:12,587 --> 00:54:14,147
No. I'm not.

882
00:54:14,227 --> 00:54:15,231
So when can I see them?

883
00:54:15,307 --> 00:54:16,627
You can't, Will.

884
00:54:16,707 --> 00:54:18,431
It's an ongoing
investigation.

885
00:54:18,507 --> 00:54:20,231
I'd completely lose
Annie's trust.

886
00:54:20,307 --> 00:54:22,032
Now, I do have
some good news.

887
00:54:22,107 --> 00:54:24,835
The lab was able to extract
enough DNA for a profile.

888
00:54:24,907 --> 00:54:26,707
We're gonna run it through
CODIS, the national database

889
00:54:26,788 --> 00:54:28,675
and if there's a hit
we should know

890
00:54:28,747 --> 00:54:30,755
within a week or two
at the most.

891
00:54:30,827 --> 00:54:33,272
Hey, I'll be right back.
I gotta call in.

892
00:54:44,667 --> 00:54:46,108
Lynn.

893
00:54:46,187 --> 00:54:47,792
Will, what are you
doing here?

894
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:49,035
I just came
from seeing Tate.

895
00:54:49,108 --> 00:54:50,396
What's wrong?

896
00:54:50,468 --> 00:54:52,355
You're not gonna
believe this.

897
00:54:52,428 --> 00:54:53,475
What? What
is this?

898
00:54:53,547 --> 00:54:54,911
Read it.

899
00:54:54,988 --> 00:54:55,948
What is it?

900
00:54:56,027 --> 00:54:56,595
Just read it.

901
00:54:59,548 --> 00:55:01,196
"l can't stop
thinking about it."

902
00:55:01,268 --> 00:55:02,948
"You inside me.
I get wet when I picture it."

903
00:55:03,028 --> 00:55:04,271
Okay, stop.

904
00:55:04,348 --> 00:55:06,268
Our daughter
wrote this.

905
00:55:06,348 --> 00:55:08,356
Annie.

906
00:55:08,428 --> 00:55:09,355
"How big are you?
I bet you taste good."

907
00:55:09,428 --> 00:55:10,629
Will, stop it.

908
00:55:10,708 --> 00:55:11,788
"l wanna see it
right now."

909
00:55:11,868 --> 00:55:13,636
Stop it,
Jesus God!

910
00:55:13,708 --> 00:55:15,716
I mean, she's 14.
Where the hell did she learn this?

911
00:55:15,788 --> 00:55:17,632
She's 14, she didn't
make this happen!

912
00:55:17,708 --> 00:55:19,432
Yeah, but we're gonna have
to talk to her about this.

913
00:55:19,508 --> 00:55:21,113
- You are not gonna talk to her.
- But look at it!

914
00:55:21,188 --> 00:55:22,749
Our daughter sounds like
a fucking porn star!

915
00:55:22,828 --> 00:55:24,989
You cannot confront
her about this.

916
00:55:25,069 --> 00:55:26,357
- I'm gonna kill him.
- No.

917
00:55:26,429 --> 00:55:27,989
I swear to God,
I'm gonna find

918
00:55:28,069 --> 00:55:29,836
this animal and I'm
gonna fucking kill him!

919
00:55:29,908 --> 00:55:31,949
Stop it!

920
00:55:32,029 --> 00:55:34,833
Oh, my God.
You're acting crazy, Will.

921
00:55:34,909 --> 00:55:38,269
No, you're not gonna--
You're not gonna read this.

922
00:55:38,349 --> 00:55:40,236
Just leave it alone.
Give it to me.

923
00:55:40,308 --> 00:55:42,753
I'll see you tonight.

924
00:55:42,869 --> 00:55:45,509
Now I need you to bring
that back to me right now, Will.

925
00:55:45,589 --> 00:55:47,236
I'll get it back
to you tomorrow.

926
00:55:47,308 --> 00:55:49,109
You do know it's
a federal crime, right?

927
00:55:49,189 --> 00:55:50,597
I just think I
have a right to know

928
00:55:50,669 --> 00:55:52,469
who my daughter's
talking to.

929
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:54,393
No, no, no. You are interfering
with the investigation.

930
00:55:54,469 --> 00:55:55,593
You've betrayed your
daughter's trust to me.

931
00:55:55,669 --> 00:55:57,229
She doesn't need to know.

932
00:55:57,309 --> 00:55:59,033
You're not letting me
do my job, Mr. Cameron.

933
00:55:59,109 --> 00:56:00,592
I need you to bring them
back to me right now, Will.

934
00:56:00,669 --> 00:56:02,153
Yeah, I will.
I'll get it back to you.

935
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:03,518
Right--

936
00:56:03,589 --> 00:56:04,790
Oh, you son of a bitch.

937
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:25,310
Hey, stranger.

938
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:27,157
This is something, huh?

939
00:56:27,229 --> 00:56:30,590
Oh, yeah, it's great. I feel 80.

940
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:31,630
Mojito?

941
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:34,111
I'm fine, thanks.

942
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:40,035
Hey, great party, man.

943
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:41,670
Will, come here!

944
00:57:24,351 --> 00:57:26,195
Will. Are you
all right?

945
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:28,879
No, I'm, I'm, I'm
just feeling, I'm--

946
00:57:28,951 --> 00:57:30,391
S-- Sorry.

947
00:57:31,991 --> 00:57:34,032
Will? Will!

948
00:58:24,512 --> 00:58:26,192
I heard the door.

949
00:58:26,272 --> 00:58:28,400
That was me.

950
00:58:28,472 --> 00:58:30,359
I, I couldn't sleep.
I took a drive.

951
00:58:30,432 --> 00:58:32,277
Well, you scared me.

952
00:58:33,633 --> 00:58:34,757
Will, you scared me.

953
00:58:34,833 --> 00:58:37,277
Sorry.

954
00:58:39,552 --> 00:58:41,200
All right, so,
are you coming up?

955
00:58:41,273 --> 00:58:42,920
In a bit.

956
00:58:45,752 --> 00:58:48,317
What are you doing?

957
00:58:48,393 --> 00:58:49,757
Nothing.

958
00:59:10,553 --> 00:59:13,434
Is this you?

959
00:59:16,633 --> 00:59:19,482
Are you, are you
Sad Little Girl?

960
00:59:22,194 --> 00:59:24,834
What are you doing?

961
00:59:24,914 --> 00:59:27,042
You're posing
as a teenage girl

962
00:59:27,114 --> 00:59:29,722
to chat with men
on line, seriously?

963
00:59:29,794 --> 00:59:31,277
That's what they do.
They showed me.

964
00:59:31,354 --> 00:59:32,675
Oh, my God.

965
00:59:32,754 --> 00:59:35,199
It's a way
of drawing them out.

966
00:59:43,394 --> 00:59:44,561
Good night.

967
01:00:54,476 --> 01:00:56,200
I spoke to Pete today.

968
01:00:56,276 --> 01:00:58,163
He's coming home
for Halloween.

969
01:00:58,276 --> 01:01:01,080
Well, he said he would try.
He's got a lot of work.

970
01:01:01,156 --> 01:01:03,556
But, and he sounds
good. Happy.

971
01:01:03,636 --> 01:01:05,960
You didn't tell
him, did you?

972
01:01:06,035 --> 01:01:07,039
No. But I--

973
01:01:07,116 --> 01:01:08,196
Don't, okay?

974
01:01:08,276 --> 01:01:10,436
Oh, about what?
What?

975
01:01:10,516 --> 01:01:12,524
Remember what we talked
about upstairs, sweetie

976
01:01:12,596 --> 01:01:14,037
about Annie
being hurt?

977
01:01:14,115 --> 01:01:15,283
I'm serious, okay?

978
01:01:15,356 --> 01:01:16,839
Okay.

979
01:01:21,076 --> 01:01:23,204
How 'bout we go to the
movies this weekend?

980
01:01:23,276 --> 01:01:25,001
Is there anything
you wanna see?

981
01:01:25,077 --> 01:01:27,325
Nothing you'd
be interested in.

982
01:01:27,397 --> 01:01:30,365
Well, try me.
I may surprise you.

983
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:31,483
Yeah, right.

984
01:01:31,556 --> 01:01:34,797
What does that mean?

985
01:01:34,876 --> 01:01:37,920
Why are you being so mean to me?
What did I do?

986
01:01:37,996 --> 01:01:39,076
I'm not being mean.

987
01:01:39,157 --> 01:01:40,520
Katie, am I being mean?

988
01:01:40,596 --> 01:01:42,964
No.

989
01:01:43,037 --> 01:01:45,198
How 'bout we go on a
bike ride this weekend?

990
01:01:45,276 --> 01:01:48,965
Well, yeah.
Uh, can we also go along the lake?

991
01:01:49,037 --> 01:01:52,681
Yeah. And we can go to that
favorite rock that you like.

992
01:01:52,757 --> 01:01:54,285
Cool.

993
01:01:58,037 --> 01:02:00,197
Great.

994
01:02:00,277 --> 01:02:04,358
You know, you don't
have to do this, honey.

995
01:02:04,437 --> 01:02:05,921
Yeah, I know.

996
01:02:09,757 --> 01:02:12,846
Well, call me if you
need anything, okay?

997
01:02:14,998 --> 01:02:17,638
Honey? Give me a kiss.

998
01:02:21,797 --> 01:02:23,118
I love you.

999
01:02:23,198 --> 01:02:24,922
See you later.

1000
01:02:24,998 --> 01:02:26,045
Okay.

1001
01:02:29,597 --> 01:02:33,079
You're gonna have
to talk to me sometime.

1002
01:02:33,157 --> 01:02:35,406
I'm really sorry,
Annie, okay?

1003
01:02:35,477 --> 01:02:38,085
I didn't know
what else to do.

1004
01:02:38,158 --> 01:02:39,238
Annie?

1005
01:02:39,318 --> 01:02:40,278
You're sorry?

1006
01:02:40,358 --> 01:02:41,602
Yeah.

1007
01:02:41,678 --> 01:02:44,285
Do you realize
what you did?

1008
01:02:44,357 --> 01:02:46,245
You fucked up everything.

1009
01:02:46,318 --> 01:02:48,359
Charlie, my parents, everything.

1010
01:02:48,438 --> 01:02:49,605
I was scared, okay?

1011
01:02:49,678 --> 01:02:51,446
No. It's not okay.

1012
01:02:51,518 --> 01:02:53,405
I kept every
secret of yours.

1013
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:57,766
Annie, you're my best friend
and I was worried about you.

1014
01:02:57,838 --> 01:03:02,442
"Was." I was
your best friend.

1015
01:03:02,518 --> 01:03:05,159
Do me a favor and never
talk to me again.

1016
01:03:05,238 --> 01:03:06,002
Annie.

1017
01:03:06,078 --> 01:03:08,206
Annie!

1018
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:10,447
That was fucking embarrassing
at the big launch party.

1019
01:03:10,519 --> 01:03:12,243
Oh, yeah, I know,
I'm sorry.

1020
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:13,727
It was just some personal stuff.
It was nothing.

1021
01:03:13,799 --> 01:03:15,566
You're sure?

1022
01:03:15,638 --> 01:03:18,399
Because you've been kind
of MIA around here lately.

1023
01:03:18,479 --> 01:03:20,760
There just could not be a
worse time to be distracted

1024
01:03:20,838 --> 01:03:22,443
while I really need
your head in the game.

1025
01:03:22,518 --> 01:03:24,406
What, you don't think
I'm giving a 100%, Coach?

1026
01:03:24,479 --> 01:03:27,600
Well, you tell me.
I put this on your desk a week ago.

1027
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:30,319
Mel's been waiting since Monday
for you to sign off on this.

1028
01:03:30,399 --> 01:03:32,319
Well, tell him, then, fine.
Run with it.

1029
01:03:32,399 --> 01:03:34,483
You haven't even looked
at it, have you?

1030
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:36,959
What the hell's
going on?

1031
01:03:43,279 --> 01:03:44,927
It's Annie.

1032
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:51,964
She was sexually assaulted.

1033
01:03:52,039 --> 01:03:53,403
What?

1034
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:56,364
Oh, my God.

1035
01:03:58,999 --> 01:04:01,323
I had no idea, Will.

1036
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:05,600
She's fine.
I mean, she wasn't, but she's okay.

1037
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,404
They catch the guy?

1038
01:04:07,479 --> 01:04:09,160
They're looking for him.

1039
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:11,521
They started with the
crime scene in the motel.

1040
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:13,007
Jesus. She
was kidnapped?

1041
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:16,769
No, she-- She sort
of knew the guy.

1042
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:19,164
I-- I don't understand.

1043
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:20,801
It was someone
she met online

1044
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:23,401
someone she'd been
talking to for a while.

1045
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:28,281
Oh, I thought you meant she was
like attacked, you know. I--

1046
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:30,084
You scared the shit
out of me.

1047
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:32,528
She was raped.

1048
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:34,444
She's 14.
The guy's in his 30s.

1049
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:37,040
I know, I know.
It's just that I was picturing--

1050
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:39,760
Well, you don't wanna know
what I was picturing.

1051
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:42,208
Could have been
much worse.

1052
01:04:45,161 --> 01:04:47,245
Hey, can I come in?

1053
01:04:47,321 --> 01:04:49,121
I guess. What's up?

1054
01:04:51,841 --> 01:04:53,085
How was school?

1055
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:55,441
Okay.

1056
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:04,521
Was it weird seeing
your friends again?

1057
01:05:04,601 --> 01:05:06,488
It was fine, Dad.

1058
01:05:09,361 --> 01:05:11,729
Did you see Gail today?

1059
01:05:12,961 --> 01:05:15,045
No, tomorrow.

1060
01:05:15,121 --> 01:05:16,442
How, how's that going?

1061
01:05:16,521 --> 01:05:19,402
Great. I'm cured.

1062
01:05:24,561 --> 01:05:27,649
Still no contact
from "Charlie"?

1063
01:05:31,721 --> 01:05:33,805
I hate when you do that.

1064
01:05:33,881 --> 01:05:36,042
Say his name like that.

1065
01:05:36,122 --> 01:05:37,201
It's not his
real name, is it?

1066
01:05:37,282 --> 01:05:38,526
What do you want, Dad?

1067
01:05:38,602 --> 01:05:39,726
Has there been
any contact?

1068
01:05:39,801 --> 01:05:40,686
No.

1069
01:05:40,761 --> 01:05:42,529
None at all?

1070
01:05:42,602 --> 01:05:44,010
What, you don't
believe me?

1071
01:05:44,082 --> 01:05:45,490
You wanna check
my phone?

1072
01:05:45,562 --> 01:05:46,489
Would you have
a problem with that?

1073
01:05:46,562 --> 01:05:47,850
Yeah, I would.

1074
01:05:47,922 --> 01:05:49,166
Why, if there's
nothing to hide

1075
01:05:49,242 --> 01:05:51,206
why would that
be a problem?

1076
01:05:51,282 --> 01:05:52,810
You're unbelievable.

1077
01:05:52,882 --> 01:05:54,923
What?

1078
01:05:55,002 --> 01:05:57,043
Take it.
What's your problem?

1079
01:05:57,122 --> 01:06:00,450
What is my problem?
My problem is you lied to me, sweetheart.

1080
01:06:00,522 --> 01:06:03,490
From the second that you knew he
wasn't 15, you should have told me

1081
01:06:03,562 --> 01:06:06,323
and you didn't.
You lied.

1082
01:06:06,402 --> 01:06:08,803
Why didn't you come and
talk to me or your mother

1083
01:06:08,882 --> 01:06:12,571
and say what was going on?

1084
01:06:12,643 --> 01:06:14,607
When you found out
for the first time, what--

1085
01:06:14,683 --> 01:06:16,363
What were you thinking?

1086
01:06:16,442 --> 01:06:19,083
You didn't know then that
something was wrong?

1087
01:06:19,162 --> 01:06:22,087
When you, you met him in the mall
and saw him for the first time

1088
01:06:22,162 --> 01:06:24,770
what do you do, you don't call me?
You don't run away?

1089
01:06:24,843 --> 01:06:27,287
You get in a car with him?
it's like rule number one.

1090
01:06:27,362 --> 01:06:29,371
You know, I'm trying
to understa--

1091
01:06:29,443 --> 01:06:30,447
Please just leave me alone.

1092
01:06:30,522 --> 01:06:31,930
But talk to me. I--

1093
01:06:32,003 --> 01:06:32,963
You're just pissed
you didn't know.

1094
01:06:33,043 --> 01:06:34,571
No, that's not--

1095
01:06:34,643 --> 01:06:36,083
No, everything
would've been fine

1096
01:06:36,163 --> 01:06:37,843
if everyone would've
just chilled out.

1097
01:06:37,923 --> 01:06:39,090
- What are you talking about?
- Charlie and me.

1098
01:06:39,163 --> 01:06:40,210
Are you out
of your mind?

1099
01:06:40,283 --> 01:06:41,287
You're the crazy one!

1100
01:06:41,363 --> 01:06:42,651
Checking my phone,

1101
01:06:42,723 --> 01:06:44,043
bringing out sickos
on the web.

1102
01:06:44,123 --> 01:06:45,127
I'm trying
to find the scumbag!

1103
01:06:45,203 --> 01:06:46,327
He's not like that!

1104
01:06:46,404 --> 01:06:48,128
You don't even know him!

1105
01:06:48,203 --> 01:06:49,970
My God, you're protecting him.
The guy raped you.

1106
01:06:50,043 --> 01:06:51,287
And you're protecting him.

1107
01:06:51,363 --> 01:06:53,043
He didn't rape me!

1108
01:06:53,124 --> 01:06:55,252
Get out, get out of my
fucking room right now!

1109
01:06:55,324 --> 01:06:56,971
I hate you. Get out!

1110
01:06:57,043 --> 01:06:58,811
Get out!

1111
01:07:01,563 --> 01:07:03,964
Get out of my room!

1112
01:07:17,963 --> 01:07:20,812
I just wanted to know
how Annie's doing.

1113
01:07:20,884 --> 01:07:23,328
You know I can't discuss her
treatment with you, Mr. Cameron.

1114
01:07:23,404 --> 01:07:25,009
I'm sorry, but this still
doesn't make sense to me.

1115
01:07:25,084 --> 01:07:26,612
She's my daughter.
A minor.

1116
01:07:26,684 --> 01:07:28,812
If she needed
an appendectomy

1117
01:07:28,884 --> 01:07:30,652
you'd need my signature
for surgery, right?

1118
01:07:30,724 --> 01:07:31,891
Therapy is different.

1119
01:07:31,964 --> 01:07:33,447
Yeah, but this whole--

1120
01:07:33,524 --> 01:07:34,768
None of this makes
sense to me.

1121
01:07:34,844 --> 01:07:35,804
And I'm really
starting to--

1122
01:07:35,884 --> 01:07:38,252
What's going on?

1123
01:07:43,124 --> 01:07:47,446
I cannot stop
thinking about it.

1124
01:07:47,525 --> 01:07:52,926
I'm driving my car

1125
01:07:53,005 --> 01:07:56,529
whatever, in the office,
in a meeting

1126
01:07:56,605 --> 01:08:00,610
and I think about him
on top of her.

1127
01:08:11,685 --> 01:08:13,485
The other night I had this dream.
I'd got him.

1128
01:08:13,565 --> 01:08:18,050
I was beating
the life out of him.

1129
01:08:18,125 --> 01:08:19,893
I was on top of him
and I was punching him

1130
01:08:19,965 --> 01:08:21,373
and punching him
and his face was caving in

1131
01:08:21,446 --> 01:08:23,170
there was blood
going everywhere

1132
01:08:23,245 --> 01:08:25,165
and I could actually
taste it.

1133
01:08:25,245 --> 01:08:27,930
I woke up, I found I'd actually
chewed the inside of my mouth.

1134
01:08:28,006 --> 01:08:30,406
It's my own blood
I was tasting.

1135
01:08:30,525 --> 01:08:32,686
What if they did catch him and they put him in jail him.
How would that make you feel?

1136
01:08:32,765 --> 01:08:35,527
Good. Relieved.

1137
01:08:36,886 --> 01:08:38,010
Angry.

1138
01:08:38,085 --> 01:08:39,329
Why angry?

1139
01:08:39,406 --> 01:08:40,890
Because I'd still
want to rip

1140
01:08:40,965 --> 01:08:42,253
his fucking head off
and now I couldn't.

1141
01:08:42,325 --> 01:08:44,486
What else are you
angry about?

1142
01:08:44,566 --> 01:08:49,007
I'm angry I didn't know
what was going on.

1143
01:08:49,086 --> 01:08:53,331
I'm angry that Annie
lied to me.

1144
01:08:53,406 --> 01:08:58,535
That I didn't know the extent
of her intimacy with him.

1145
01:09:02,446 --> 01:09:04,607
That I couldn't--

1146
01:09:06,446 --> 01:09:08,290
What?

1147
01:09:08,366 --> 01:09:10,133
Stop it?

1148
01:09:13,446 --> 01:09:17,887
We can't control what happens
to us or our loved ones.

1149
01:09:17,966 --> 01:09:20,694
What happens when Annie
goes to college?

1150
01:09:20,766 --> 01:09:22,927
What are you saying?

1151
01:09:23,007 --> 01:09:26,008
People get hurt.

1152
01:09:26,086 --> 01:09:27,570
There's only
so much we can do

1153
01:09:27,647 --> 01:09:28,891
to protect ourselves,
our children.

1154
01:09:28,966 --> 01:09:30,330
The only thing
we can do

1155
01:09:30,407 --> 01:09:31,967
is we can be there
for each other

1156
01:09:32,047 --> 01:09:35,015
when we do fall down,
to pick each other up.

1157
01:10:39,648 --> 01:10:41,209
Ugh!

1158
01:10:49,328 --> 01:10:51,893
Can I help you with
anything today, sir?

1159
01:11:43,649 --> 01:11:45,330
Hey, Pop!

1160
01:11:49,410 --> 01:11:50,610
Hey.

1161
01:11:52,090 --> 01:11:53,890
You look older.

1162
01:11:53,970 --> 01:11:56,218
It's only been
six weeks, smart ass.

1163
01:11:56,290 --> 01:11:57,818
Yeah, still,
maybe it's, uh

1164
01:11:57,890 --> 01:11:59,494
like Einstein's
special relativity.

1165
01:11:59,570 --> 01:12:01,698
You know, six weeks to me,
five years to you.

1166
01:12:01,770 --> 01:12:05,055
I think I preferred you
with a high school education.

1167
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:08,655
Dude. No way.
I don't want you to hurt yourself.

1168
01:12:08,730 --> 01:12:09,690
So how was
the ride in?

1169
01:12:09,770 --> 01:12:11,058
Okay.

1170
01:12:11,130 --> 01:12:12,494
Okay. I'm still
a little, ech.

1171
01:12:12,570 --> 01:12:13,814
Oh. Big night, eh?

1172
01:12:13,891 --> 01:12:15,811
I was off my face,
wasn't i?

1173
01:12:15,890 --> 01:12:17,374
Come here.

1174
01:12:24,770 --> 01:12:27,738
Jesus, Pop. What is it?

1175
01:12:30,771 --> 01:12:33,052
Where are the kids?

1176
01:12:33,130 --> 01:12:36,491
Come on, kids.
Hurry up, the food 's gonna be cold.

1177
01:12:37,731 --> 01:12:39,335
All right, ready?

1178
01:12:39,411 --> 01:12:40,852
Hey!

1179
01:12:42,811 --> 01:12:45,932
it's fantastic.

1180
01:12:46,011 --> 01:12:48,619
Look at the
toilet seat cover.

1181
01:12:48,691 --> 01:12:51,452
It was her idea.

1182
01:12:51,531 --> 01:12:53,931
Let me help you off with your
flippers so you can eat.

1183
01:12:54,011 --> 01:12:55,375
No, Mom, that's cheating.

1184
01:12:55,451 --> 01:12:56,531
That's not a very
scary mask, Pete.

1185
01:12:56,611 --> 01:12:57,691
It is to Grandpa.

1186
01:12:57,771 --> 01:12:58,731
Don't get
me started.

1187
01:12:58,811 --> 01:13:00,339
He's a socialist.

1188
01:13:00,412 --> 01:13:01,895
Oh, Cal, now come on.

1189
01:13:01,971 --> 01:13:02,975
No costume, Annie?

1190
01:13:03,051 --> 01:13:04,939
This is my costume.

1191
01:13:05,011 --> 01:13:06,616
(Kate) You're not supposed
to wear a penguin

1192
01:13:06,692 --> 01:13:08,055
you're supposed
to be a penguin.

1193
01:13:08,131 --> 01:13:09,736
Do you want me
to come or not?

1194
01:13:09,811 --> 01:13:11,295
Okay. I guess
you can come.

1195
01:13:13,652 --> 01:13:16,456
I'm sorry I
didn't get to email much.

1196
01:13:16,532 --> 01:13:17,940
You know, things
have been really crazy.

1197
01:13:18,011 --> 01:13:19,932
It's no big deal.

1198
01:13:20,012 --> 01:13:23,417
No. No, I should have called more.
Checked in a bit.

1199
01:13:23,492 --> 01:13:27,213
You know I love you, right?
Right?

1200
01:13:27,292 --> 01:13:29,060
Did you
kids ever hear the story

1201
01:13:29,132 --> 01:13:31,019
about when Grandpa and
I met on Halloween?

1202
01:13:31,092 --> 01:13:32,740
He asked me to take
a picture of him

1203
01:13:32,812 --> 01:13:35,660
next to this statue
of a werewolf

1204
01:13:35,732 --> 01:13:37,337
They've all heard
the story, Susan.

1205
01:13:37,412 --> 01:13:38,252
No, no, we haven 't.

1206
01:13:38,332 --> 01:13:39,259
Okay, good.

1207
01:13:39,332 --> 01:13:40,740
So, he goes up

1208
01:13:40,812 --> 01:13:42,296
and he stands
right under it

1209
01:13:42,373 --> 01:13:44,653
trying to impress me,
of course.

1210
01:13:44,732 --> 01:13:47,013
But it turns out it's just a
guy in a costume, right, hon?

1211
01:13:47,092 --> 01:13:49,100
And he grabs Grandpa.

1212
01:13:49,172 --> 01:13:51,453
And Grandpa starts
screamin ' like a girl.

1213
01:13:51,533 --> 01:13:53,573
- I did not.
- You did.

1214
01:13:57,133 --> 01:13:59,456
Annie, honey.
Is that corn cold?

1215
01:13:59,532 --> 01:14:00,579
Because I could heat it
up for you, sweetie.

1216
01:14:00,652 --> 01:14:02,616
Mm. it's fine.

1217
01:14:02,692 --> 01:14:05,661
Annie, you have to try the sweet potatoes.
They are amazing.

1218
01:14:05,732 --> 01:14:10,294
Oh, they are, sweetheart, they are.
Just, just have a little. You'll love 'em.

1219
01:14:10,372 --> 01:14:12,860
You guys wanna cut
my steak, too?

1220
01:14:19,253 --> 01:14:20,737
So, I hear you got
a girl, Pete.

1221
01:14:20,813 --> 01:14:24,021
What? No.
No, God, no.

1222
01:14:24,093 --> 01:14:26,013
No, it's just this girl
I met at a mixer.

1223
01:14:26,093 --> 01:14:27,938
Yeah, she's a DG.

1224
01:14:28,013 --> 01:14:30,621
But we 're not-- you know,
we 're just friends.

1225
01:14:30,693 --> 01:14:33,814
She's super athletic though.
She plays tennis and lacrosse.

1226
01:14:33,893 --> 01:14:34,614
You'd really like her.

1227
01:14:34,693 --> 01:14:36,581
Cool.

1228
01:14:36,654 --> 01:14:39,654
But, you know, she's, she's not
my girlfriend or anything.

1229
01:14:39,733 --> 01:14:41,021
We just started
hanging out.

1230
01:14:41,093 --> 01:14:42,741
Yeah.

1231
01:14:42,814 --> 01:14:46,458
Peter, it's okay for you
to have a girlfriend.

1232
01:14:46,534 --> 01:14:48,378
It's pretty normal.
Right, Dad?

1233
01:14:51,174 --> 01:14:52,462
I'm not sure
I understand.

1234
01:14:52,534 --> 01:14:54,858
You don't understand?

1235
01:14:54,933 --> 01:14:57,137
Have you guys
had sex yet?

1236
01:14:57,214 --> 01:14:58,174
Annie.

1237
01:14:58,254 --> 01:14:59,978
Was she good?

1238
01:15:00,054 --> 01:15:01,821
That's enough.

1239
01:15:01,894 --> 01:15:03,378
What?

1240
01:15:03,454 --> 01:15:07,938
You can tell everybody
about my life

1241
01:15:08,014 --> 01:15:13,579
about me having sex and who
with, but I can't ask him?

1242
01:15:13,654 --> 01:15:16,819
I asked you
not to tell him.

1243
01:15:16,894 --> 01:15:19,862
That's the only
thing I asked.

1244
01:15:19,934 --> 01:15:23,459
Thank you, Dad.

1245
01:15:23,534 --> 01:15:28,096
I hope you guys
have an awesome time.

1246
01:15:28,174 --> 01:15:30,062
Honey,
please, please stay.

1247
01:15:30,135 --> 01:15:31,543
No. No. Let me go.

1248
01:15:36,735 --> 01:15:38,535
Okay. Good news.

1249
01:15:38,615 --> 01:15:40,055
We ran the DNA
from his shirt

1250
01:15:40,135 --> 01:15:41,815
through the national database.

1251
01:15:41,895 --> 01:15:43,815
And we actually
found a match.

1252
01:15:43,894 --> 01:15:45,302
That's, that's incredible.

1253
01:15:45,375 --> 01:15:46,903
So what happens now?
You arrest him?

1254
01:15:46,975 --> 01:15:48,459
It's not that easy.

1255
01:15:48,535 --> 01:15:50,619
While the DNA is
on the database

1256
01:15:50,695 --> 01:15:53,019
it's still a John Doe- We
don't know who it belongs to.

1257
01:15:53,095 --> 01:15:54,458
I don't
understand.

1258
01:15:54,535 --> 01:15:56,063
Well, there were
other cases, Will

1259
01:15:56,135 --> 01:15:58,143
three of them, where
rapes were reported.

1260
01:15:58,215 --> 01:15:59,743
We were able to recover
genetic material

1261
01:15:59,815 --> 01:16:01,419
from the victim
and the crime scene.

1262
01:16:01,495 --> 01:16:03,459
The DNA profile
is the same.

1263
01:16:03,535 --> 01:16:05,095
It's just that we don't know
who it belongs to.

1264
01:16:05,175 --> 01:16:07,095
So he's done this before.

1265
01:16:07,176 --> 01:16:09,380
- Yes, he has.
- Oh, my God.

1266
01:16:09,455 --> 01:16:12,063
Well, he's had other girlfriends before.
I told you that.

1267
01:16:12,136 --> 01:16:13,576
These weren't
girlfriends, Annie.

1268
01:16:13,655 --> 01:16:14,856
These were minors
who reported a rape.

1269
01:16:14,935 --> 01:16:17,139
Well, DNA can be wrong.

1270
01:16:17,216 --> 01:16:20,697
The odds of these four samples
not coming from the same person

1271
01:16:20,776 --> 01:16:24,420
are in the hundreds of millions.
It's the same guy.

1272
01:16:24,495 --> 01:16:27,016
Now, look. We, uh, we
don't normally do this.

1273
01:16:27,095 --> 01:16:28,743
We 're very careful
with victim information.

1274
01:16:28,816 --> 01:16:30,376
But I'm hoping there
might be some kind

1275
01:16:30,456 --> 01:16:32,780
of connection between
all four of you girls.

1276
01:16:32,855 --> 01:16:34,700
Maybe you went to
the same camp together

1277
01:16:34,775 --> 01:16:36,620
you shopped
at the same mall.

1278
01:16:36,696 --> 01:16:38,343
I can't give you their names
but I was hoping that

1279
01:16:38,416 --> 01:16:40,697
you might take a look
at their pictures.

1280
01:16:40,776 --> 01:16:42,184
Wait a minute.
I don't know if this is a good idea.

1281
01:16:42,256 --> 01:16:44,657
No, no. I want,
I want to. Yeah.

1282
01:16:44,736 --> 01:16:47,824
All right, Annie, do
you know this girl?

1283
01:16:47,896 --> 01:16:49,577
She's from Cleveland.

1284
01:16:49,656 --> 01:16:51,020
She's fifteen years old.

1285
01:16:55,577 --> 01:16:57,224
No.

1286
01:16:57,296 --> 01:16:59,620
No? Okay.

1287
01:16:59,697 --> 01:17:01,137
This is the Milwaukee case.

1288
01:17:01,217 --> 01:17:04,141
This photo was taken
about a year ago.

1289
01:17:04,217 --> 01:17:07,305
She's fourteen.

1290
01:17:07,377 --> 01:17:12,265
Now, this girl was assaulted in St.
Louis seven months ago.

1291
01:17:12,337 --> 01:17:17,499
She's twelve.

1292
01:17:17,576 --> 01:17:19,137
Oh, my God.

1293
01:17:23,697 --> 01:17:26,382
I don't, I
don't know them.

1294
01:17:26,457 --> 01:17:30,702
Okay. It's okay.
You did a good job.

1295
01:17:30,777 --> 01:17:31,901
Thank you, Annie.

1296
01:17:31,977 --> 01:17:33,537
Honey.

1297
01:17:33,617 --> 01:17:35,897
No. I'm fine.
I just need a second.

1298
01:17:35,977 --> 01:17:38,181
So you're telling me the FBI's
been chasing this guy for years?

1299
01:17:38,258 --> 01:17:40,658
It looks that way, yeah.

1300
01:17:45,137 --> 01:17:47,101
Look, on the upside, Will there's
more information for us.

1301
01:17:47,178 --> 01:17:48,978
There's more
evidence for us.

1302
01:17:49,058 --> 01:17:51,186
The investigation is seeing
a real breakthrough.

1303
01:17:51,258 --> 01:17:52,698
I bet the agent in St.
Louis said the same thing

1304
01:17:52,778 --> 01:17:54,426
to some family
about seven months ago.

1305
01:17:54,497 --> 01:17:56,025
I understand your
frustration, Will, I do

1306
01:17:56,098 --> 01:17:57,462
but I'm working as hard
as I can for Annie.

1307
01:17:57,538 --> 01:17:59,666
Yeah, but it's
not enough, is it?

1308
01:17:59,738 --> 01:18:01,746
I mean, that sick fuck is still out
there grooming other girls, right?

1309
01:18:01,818 --> 01:18:03,826
Will, I'm doing all I can.
I'm sorry you don't see it that way.

1310
01:18:03,898 --> 01:18:06,867
Annie ? Annie!

1311
01:18:06,937 --> 01:18:08,301
Did she come
down here?

1312
01:18:18,138 --> 01:18:21,979
You okay?

1313
01:18:22,058 --> 01:18:24,219
You want something
to drink? Water?

1314
01:18:24,298 --> 01:18:25,782
There were other girls.

1315
01:18:25,859 --> 01:18:27,342
What other girls?
Tell me what you mean.

1316
01:18:27,418 --> 01:18:29,666
Charlie. He had
other girls.

1317
01:18:29,738 --> 01:18:33,099
Three of them.
Like me.

1318
01:18:33,178 --> 01:18:34,783
There were other
victims, you mean?

1319
01:18:34,859 --> 01:18:36,506
He said that I
was special.

1320
01:18:36,578 --> 01:18:40,746
That I was the only
one for him.

1321
01:18:40,818 --> 01:18:42,859
But if there are
other girls--

1322
01:18:42,939 --> 01:18:45,503
They weren't even-- They
weren't even that pretty!

1323
01:18:45,579 --> 01:18:46,506
Tell me why it matters.

1324
01:18:46,578 --> 01:18:47,702
No. No. No.

1325
01:18:47,779 --> 01:18:50,344
Why does that
matter?

1326
01:18:50,418 --> 01:18:54,827
Because they
were just like me.

1327
01:18:54,899 --> 01:18:59,428
He told me, he said
I was pretty.

1328
01:18:59,499 --> 01:19:03,383
What's wrong with me?

1329
01:19:03,459 --> 01:19:06,580
Why does it mean that
something 's wrong with you?

1330
01:19:06,659 --> 01:19:12,061
If he lied to me the way he lied to
those other girls, he never loved me.

1331
01:19:12,139 --> 01:19:16,023
He lied so he could
have sex with me.

1332
01:19:18,740 --> 01:19:20,540
What, Annie ?

1333
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:24,544
Oh, my God.

1334
01:19:26,379 --> 01:19:29,184
He raped me.

1335
01:19:29,260 --> 01:19:33,024
He, he raped me.

1336
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:38,505
How could I have
been so stupid?

1337
01:19:38,580 --> 01:19:42,148
All he wanted-- My God.

1338
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:43,825
All he wanted was--

1339
01:19:47,260 --> 01:19:50,141
God, I'm so sorry.

1340
01:20:15,941 --> 01:20:18,265
Oh, God.
She's finally asleep.

1341
01:20:18,340 --> 01:20:21,265
This guy is one sick fuck.

1342
01:20:23,741 --> 01:20:28,062
Will, I'm so worried about her.
I've never seen her like this. I'm just--

1343
01:20:28,141 --> 01:20:32,746
He's just destroyed her.

1344
01:20:32,821 --> 01:20:34,905
He sent her
a picture of his dick.

1345
01:20:41,421 --> 01:20:43,909
Please stop looking at this shit!

1346
01:20:43,981 --> 01:20:45,465
What are you doing?

1347
01:20:45,541 --> 01:20:47,550
What the f--
What are you doing?

1348
01:20:47,622 --> 01:20:50,503
Why are you down here when you
should be up there with her?

1349
01:20:50,581 --> 01:20:52,545
You think finding this guy
is more important

1350
01:20:52,621 --> 01:20:54,585
that it's gonna make her better?
Do you think that--

1351
01:20:54,662 --> 01:20:57,630
Well, it might. Or it might save
some other poor fucking girl.

1352
01:20:57,701 --> 01:21:01,750
I want this guy out of my house.
I want him out of my house!

1353
01:21:01,821 --> 01:21:03,862
You want me to go up there and
talk to her? I've tried.

1354
01:21:03,942 --> 01:21:05,230
She won't fucking
talk to me!

1355
01:21:05,302 --> 01:21:06,426
Shut up!

1356
01:21:06,502 --> 01:21:09,470
She finally fell asleep.

1357
01:21:09,542 --> 01:21:13,503
You'd fucking know that if
you were up there with her.

1358
01:21:13,582 --> 01:21:17,587
It's Annie.
It's Annie.

1359
01:21:17,662 --> 01:21:20,947
She is in pain.
She needs you and you're just--

1360
01:21:21,022 --> 01:21:24,110
You're sitting there
doing nothing!

1361
01:21:33,502 --> 01:21:35,107
All right.

1362
01:21:37,983 --> 01:21:40,667
Here, here you go.

1363
01:22:04,983 --> 01:22:07,231
Cameron!

1364
01:22:07,303 --> 01:22:09,344
Look, Vicki's sick.
She can't play today.

1365
01:22:09,423 --> 01:22:10,863
You're gonna start
in her place.

1366
01:22:10,943 --> 01:22:12,067
I don't know, Coach. I--

1367
01:22:12,144 --> 01:22:13,748
We need you, Annie.

1368
01:22:13,823 --> 01:22:15,547
Can I count on you?

1369
01:22:15,623 --> 01:22:18,984
Yeah.

1370
01:22:19,063 --> 01:22:21,508
That's the spirit.

1371
01:22:21,584 --> 01:22:22,708
At the net.

1372
01:22:23,983 --> 01:22:24,943
Annie! Harder!

1373
01:22:31,024 --> 01:22:34,145
Hey, guys. Hi, Lynn.

1374
01:22:34,224 --> 01:22:35,152
Hey.

1375
01:22:41,184 --> 01:22:42,351
You having
fun? Yeah?

1376
01:22:42,424 --> 01:22:46,145
Dig in!

1377
01:22:46,224 --> 01:22:47,708
Nice Set!

1378
01:22:47,784 --> 01:22:51,112
Block it!

1379
01:23:09,065 --> 01:23:10,625
You having
a good time?

1380
01:23:10,705 --> 01:23:12,429
Huh?

1381
01:23:12,504 --> 01:23:14,905
You enjoying this, looking
at all the young girls?

1382
01:23:14,984 --> 01:23:15,912
What's that?

1383
01:23:15,985 --> 01:23:16,748
You sick fuck!

1384
01:23:19,585 --> 01:23:21,713
I'll kill ya!
You fucking shit.

1385
01:23:21,785 --> 01:23:24,633
You sick fucking cunt!
I'll kill ya!

1386
01:23:26,865 --> 01:23:28,066
Oh, my God!

1387
01:23:28,145 --> 01:23:29,465
Dad, are you okay?

1388
01:23:29,545 --> 01:23:31,105
What happened?

1389
01:23:31,185 --> 01:23:32,549
What are you doing?

1390
01:23:32,625 --> 01:23:34,230
I'm calling the police.

1391
01:23:34,305 --> 01:23:36,225
Hey, hey, no,
no, there's no need

1392
01:23:36,305 --> 01:23:37,910
it's, it's just
a misunderstanding.

1393
01:23:37,985 --> 01:23:40,189
Dad, you're hurt.

1394
01:23:40,265 --> 01:23:43,353
No, no. Pumpkin, I'm fine, I'm fine.
I'm sorry if I scared you, I'm okay.

1395
01:23:43,425 --> 01:23:45,073
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

1396
01:23:45,145 --> 01:23:46,705
It's just a misunderstanding,
that's all.

1397
01:23:49,346 --> 01:23:53,394
Okay, can we get the game
going again, please?

1398
01:23:55,185 --> 01:23:56,473
How could you
do that to me?

1399
01:23:56,545 --> 01:23:57,833
I'm really sorry.

1400
01:23:57,905 --> 01:24:00,109
You're sorry?
Gee, Dad, thanks.

1401
01:24:00,186 --> 01:24:02,073
That makes everything
so much better.

1402
01:24:02,145 --> 01:24:04,873
I lost my temper.
I don't know what else to say. I'm sorry.

1403
01:24:04,946 --> 01:24:08,547
Don't you get it?
There 's nothing anybody can say.

1404
01:24:08,626 --> 01:24:09,826
My life is ruined.

1405
01:24:09,906 --> 01:24:11,826
No, it's not ruined.

1406
01:24:11,906 --> 01:24:15,986
We're going through a tough time
but your life's not ruined.

1407
01:24:16,066 --> 01:24:19,787
We're going through
a tough time?

1408
01:24:19,866 --> 01:24:22,627
We didn't get raped.

1409
01:24:22,707 --> 01:24:26,787
We're not the laughingstock
of New Trier. I am!

1410
01:24:26,866 --> 01:24:27,750
I got raped. Not you!

1411
01:24:27,826 --> 01:24:29,746
I know that.

1412
01:24:29,827 --> 01:24:34,508
Nothing 's ever gonna be the same.
I know that.

1413
01:24:34,586 --> 01:24:40,992
But, please, can you please stop
reminding me of it every second?

1414
01:24:55,707 --> 01:24:58,828
Annie, wait!
I'm so sorry.

1415
01:24:58,947 --> 01:25:01,631
For what?
It's not your fault my dad's a psycho.

1416
01:25:01,707 --> 01:25:06,028
What? No. I swear to God, I
had nothing to do with it.

1417
01:25:06,107 --> 01:25:08,355
Wait, what are
you talking about?

1418
01:25:08,427 --> 01:25:10,227
The Internet thing.

1419
01:25:10,307 --> 01:25:12,151
What?

1420
01:25:12,227 --> 01:25:13,591
Oh, uh--

1421
01:25:13,667 --> 01:25:15,075
Annie!

1422
01:25:15,147 --> 01:25:16,468
Annie!

1423
01:25:30,148 --> 01:25:31,752
Cameron.

1424
01:25:34,228 --> 01:25:35,428
Oh, my God.

1425
01:25:38,228 --> 01:25:39,756
My God.

1426
01:25:57,348 --> 01:25:58,788
Hello?

1427
01:26:02,829 --> 01:26:04,149
Lynn?

1428
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:14,555
Hello?

1429
01:27:14,670 --> 01:27:16,874
Will, where have you been?
I've been calling you.

1430
01:27:16,950 --> 01:27:19,198
What, what do you mean?
I'm, I'm here. Where are you?

1431
01:27:19,270 --> 01:27:20,394
On my way.
ls, is Annie there?

1432
01:27:20,470 --> 01:27:22,270
No, I don't, why?

1433
01:27:22,350 --> 01:27:24,359
Just-- Brittany called me-
Something 's happened.

1434
01:27:24,431 --> 01:27:25,794
Is she there?

1435
01:27:25,870 --> 01:27:28,151
What? Annie?
What, what happened?

1436
01:27:28,230 --> 01:27:31,515
I-- don't-- just go check, please!
Call me back.

1437
01:27:32,550 --> 01:27:33,630
Annie!

1438
01:27:34,790 --> 01:27:36,154
Annie.

1439
01:27:38,870 --> 01:27:40,278
Annie.

1440
01:27:41,990 --> 01:27:43,354
Annie, are you
in there?

1441
01:27:45,310 --> 01:27:47,831
Annie, open this door!

1442
01:27:47,910 --> 01:27:50,278
Annie!

1443
01:27:56,511 --> 01:27:58,595
Shit.

1444
01:27:58,671 --> 01:28:00,471
Will?

1445
01:28:00,551 --> 01:28:02,275
Call an ambulance!

1446
01:28:02,351 --> 01:28:04,359
How many pills
have you taken ?

1447
01:28:04,431 --> 01:28:05,719
I'm not really--

1448
01:28:05,791 --> 01:28:07,678
Call an ambulance!

1449
01:28:07,751 --> 01:28:08,875
Hello?

1450
01:28:08,951 --> 01:28:10,719
Open your mouth.

1451
01:28:10,791 --> 01:28:12,274
Open your mouth,
sweetheart.

1452
01:28:12,351 --> 01:28:13,311
We need, please--

1453
01:28:15,111 --> 01:28:16,039
She's taken
too many pills ?

1454
01:28:16,111 --> 01:28:17,039
Yeah. Come on.

1455
01:28:17,111 --> 01:28:18,551
It's all right.

1456
01:28:49,392 --> 01:28:51,116
She asleep?

1457
01:28:53,792 --> 01:28:55,876
I'm through talking.

1458
01:29:01,992 --> 01:29:03,912
Brittany's spending
the night.

1459
01:29:19,753 --> 01:29:21,193
Good night.

1460
01:30:40,714 --> 01:30:42,634
Dad?

1461
01:30:51,875 --> 01:30:53,042
Dad.

1462
01:30:56,474 --> 01:30:58,079
Are you okay?

1463
01:31:00,955 --> 01:31:03,923
You remember the first
time you went in the pool?

1464
01:31:03,995 --> 01:31:06,396
What?

1465
01:31:06,474 --> 01:31:08,635
You probably don't.
You were two.

1466
01:31:08,715 --> 01:31:12,523
Peter was scared to death
the first time he went in.

1467
01:31:12,595 --> 01:31:16,917
He screamed and cried so
much, he didn't stop.

1468
01:31:16,995 --> 01:31:20,640
He was fine in the
bath, but pool...

1469
01:31:23,395 --> 01:31:26,199
Not you.

1470
01:31:26,275 --> 01:31:29,036
You were fearless.

1471
01:31:30,675 --> 01:31:32,520
I remember.

1472
01:31:33,596 --> 01:31:36,444
You were amazing.

1473
01:31:36,515 --> 01:31:39,756
Came in with me and almost
immediately started laughing

1474
01:31:39,835 --> 01:31:42,716
and playing and
splashing around.

1475
01:31:42,796 --> 01:31:47,477
You just had
this confidence.

1476
01:31:47,556 --> 01:31:48,723
It wasn't just swimming.

1477
01:31:48,796 --> 01:31:50,204
You just had this--

1478
01:31:50,276 --> 01:31:54,924
trust--in things, people,
the world.

1479
01:31:54,996 --> 01:31:57,037
It was who you were.

1480
01:31:59,236 --> 01:32:01,004
No fear.

1481
01:32:05,036 --> 01:32:09,204
God, I loved that.

1482
01:32:09,277 --> 01:32:11,525
I was so proud of it.

1483
01:32:13,316 --> 01:32:14,844
I envied it.

1484
01:32:18,157 --> 01:32:21,038
And I was so afraid that you'd
lose it as you grew up.

1485
01:32:21,116 --> 01:32:23,757
That confidence.
That faith.

1486
01:32:25,196 --> 01:32:26,921
But you didn't.

1487
01:32:32,117 --> 01:32:34,441
And then I failed you.

1488
01:32:36,957 --> 01:32:40,841
It was my job to make
sure you didn't lose it.

1489
01:32:40,917 --> 01:32:44,442
To keep you safe.

1490
01:32:44,517 --> 01:32:47,279
What am I if I
can't protect you?

1491
01:32:50,157 --> 01:32:54,521
And to see you lose
that confidence

1492
01:32:54,597 --> 01:32:57,205
to see you
question yourself.

1493
01:33:00,077 --> 01:33:01,997
That the idea would
even occur to you

1494
01:33:02,078 --> 01:33:06,006
to want to hurt yourself.

1495
01:33:06,077 --> 01:33:07,877
Or for you to think
for one minute

1496
01:33:07,958 --> 01:33:10,358
that you weren't
as beautiful--

1497
01:33:23,398 --> 01:33:26,879
I don't know if you can
ever forgive me, Annie.

1498
01:33:26,958 --> 01:33:32,447
I really don't know
if you should.

1499
01:33:32,518 --> 01:33:36,283
But I'm sorry.

1500
01:33:36,359 --> 01:33:38,846
I'm so sorry.

1501
01:33:38,918 --> 01:33:41,483
Dad. Daddy.

1502
01:33:45,478 --> 01:33:47,278
I love you so much.

1503
01:33:50,719 --> 01:33:52,279
Dad.

1504
01:34:09,199 --> 01:34:11,763
Dad. Come on.
How much longer?

1505
01:34:11,839 --> 01:34:14,163
We just
got here, buddy.

1506
01:34:14,239 --> 01:34:16,039
Let's at least pick up some
stuff for the park. Okay?

1507
01:34:16,119 --> 01:34:17,680
What a day.

1508
01:34:17,759 --> 01:34:19,920
Susanna- Grab some
apples, will ya ?

1509
01:34:19,999 --> 01:34:23,164
Hey, Dad.
Can I do it for awhile ?

1510
01:34:23,239 --> 01:34:25,760
Okay. Be careful,
all right, buddy?

1511
01:34:27,879 --> 01:34:30,607
Well, hello.
How do I look?

1512
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:32,000
Goofy.

1513
01:34:32,079 --> 01:34:33,607
Yeah. Probably so.

1514
01:34:33,680 --> 01:34:35,404
Mr. Weston!

1515
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:36,768
Hey, Tyler,
how's it going?

1516
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:37,844
I'm good. How
about yourself?

1517
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:39,328
I'm good.

1518
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:40,688
Uh, Mom, Dad, this
is Mr. Weston.

1519
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:41,927
Hey, very nice
to meet you.

1520
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,320
He's my
physics teacher.

1521
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:45,080
Pleasure, pleasure.
Hey,Susanna.

1522
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:46,960
One of my
students, Tyler.

1523
01:34:47,039 --> 01:34:49,407
Oh. Hi, Tyler. I'm Susanna.
Nice to meet you.

1524
01:34:49,479 --> 01:34:50,527
My wife, Susanna.

1525
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:51,484
And I'm Jennifer.

1526
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:52,803
Hi, Jennifer.

1527
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:54,408
And this is
our boy, Mark.

1528
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:56,880
Hey, man.
How's it goin'?

1529
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:58,520
So, great day, huh?

1530
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:00,008
It is gorgeous.
