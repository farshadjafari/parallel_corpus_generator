1
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,600
Come on,
pick up your feet.

2
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:17,519
- This box is pretty heavy, Lieutenant.
- Gold usually is.

3
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:20,147
Come on, get a hold of it in there.

4
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:25,411
- Get in there with it, and stay there.
- Yes, sir.

5
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,993
Tell Colonel McNally the train's ready.

6
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:33,833
- We're waiting instructions.
- Yes, sir.

7
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,129
Tell Colonel McNally
the train is ready.

8
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:46,351
- Waiting instructions.
- Thanks.

9
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:52,267
I'm sorry to disturb you, Colonel.

10
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:57,695
You were told to, Lieutenant.
You'd have been sorrier if you hadn't.

11
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,280
Yes, sir.

12
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,612
- What do you want?
- A message from Plainsburg.

13
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:05,822
- What does Lieutenant Forsythe want?
- Further instructions, sir.

14
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:09,454
You tell the Lieutenant 
to get in that car,

15
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,619
and stay there until I 
knock on the door.

16
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,211
Yes, sir.

17
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:28,217
- Sergeant, the gold's on the train.
- Did you hear that?

18
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:33,513
The Colonel says for you
to get in that car

19
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:36,222
and stay there
until he knocks on the door.

20
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:38,978
Good luck, Lieutenant.

21
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:42,905
Let's go.

22
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,927
Hey, Sergeant.
The train's left Plainsburg.

23
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:08,389
You all hear that?
Keep on listening.

24
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:16,392
Captain!
Message coming through.

25
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:23,649
- The train is on its way.
- Better get ready.

26
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,569
- Don't worry, Captain.
- We're waiting.

27
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,412
What time is that train due
at River Junction?

28
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:36,792
About 15 minutes, sir.
She'll take on wood and water.

29
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,292
- Who's in command?
- Captain Barrett, sir.

30
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,920
Well, you give Captain Barrett
my compliments.

31
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,673
And tell him if anything goes wrong
at River Junction,

32
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:48,591
I will personally see
that he rues the day.

33
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:50,182
Yes, sir.

34
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:54,928
I can't see how you can hear a train
by listening to the rail.

35
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:58,064
- Them rails is all put together...
- Shut up!

36
00:05:58,192 --> 00:05:59,602
Keep quiet.

37
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:04,480
- Here she comes, Sarge.
- All right. Get back.

38
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:10,324
Don't let nobody see ya.
And don't come out till I tell ya.

39
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,230
It's hard to let that much gold go by.

40
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:40,772
When it gets as far as the Captain,
we'll get it back.

41
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:45,187
All right, boys. Let's go.
Move it. Come on.

42
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:48,778
Let's get those ropes across the track.

43
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:07,964
Bigfoot, tell the Captain
the train passed here.

44
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:09,554
Sure, Sergeant.

45
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,223
- Get 'em to tie them ropes well.
- Tie those ropes hard and fast.

46
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,345
Hank, move faster,
or the train will be gone!

47
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:24,603
Captain! They left River Junction.

48
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:28,073
James... you got enough grease?

49
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:31,816
We've got enough so when that train
hits, it won't go nowhere.

50
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:35,072
- You'd better put it on extra heavy.
- Yes, sir.

51
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,245
- Yes, sir.
- You ready?

52
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,952
These hornets are getting mad.
Just listen to 'em.

53
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:44,044
They're mad all right.

54
00:07:56,268 --> 00:08:02,686
- How does it look, Lieutenant?
- Well, it looks just fine.

55
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:11,605
- She's a comin', Captain.
- Everybody get out of sight.

56
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:14,149
And don't come out until you see me.

57
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:16,859
Beauford, get down from that tree.

58
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,703
- Train's left River Junction, sir.
- Good.

59
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,208
Once it gets here,
there's not much to worry about.

60
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:27,711
- It isn't here yet, Lieutenant.
- No, sir, but...

61
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:31,791
- So, do you mind if I worry?
- No, sir.

62
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:35,048
- May I say something, Colonel?
- Go ahead.

63
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:39,846
Is it because from River Junction
to here is the worst part of the trip

64
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,683
that you gave
the gold detail to Lieutenant Forsythe?

65
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:45,056
That's one of the reasons.

66
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:48,062
He's been with you
quite a while, hasn't he, sir?

67
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:52,647
- Since the war began.
- Yes, sir.

68
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:03,457
That engine's sure pullin' hard
up that hill.

69
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,671
We're slowing down, Lieutenant.

70
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:23,973
Watch her when she hits the grease.

71
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:31,022
The wheels are slipping
and we have no traction.

72
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,506
Hornets!

73
00:10:01,894 --> 00:10:03,886
We've got to get out of here.

74
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:12,727
- We're all set, Captain.
- Good. Billy Joe, get that wire down.

75
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:18,232
Blow off her steam.

76
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:25,459
All right, everybody on.
Cut loose.

77
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:30,079
Come on, get on.

78
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:36,377
Hurry up! Hurry up!

79
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,383
Jack, come on!
Get up, Jack!

80
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,477
Willie, you nearly didn't make it.

81
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:52,854
The wire's dead.
Could be the lines are down.

82
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:56,272
The wires are dead
between here and River Junction!

83
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:59,941
- Damn! Call in your outposts.
- Yes, sir.

84
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:17,423
Open the door.

85
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:32,393
- Captain, them hornets is sure busy.
- Yeah. I see 'em.

86
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,103
For God's sake, Harry, jump!

87
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:49,662
Let's go! Jump!
Get off the train.

88
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,372
- I can't see.
- Jump.

89
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:02,552
- Johnson, is that all of them?
- I'll find out, Captain.

90
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:08,559
Can't see a soul.

91
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:12,637
Give those hornets some smoke
and get them out of there.

92
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,894
I don't want 'em there when I go in.

93
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,826
It's all yours, Captain.

94
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:49,180
Yes, sir.

95
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:54,056
We're going faster than we figured.
Can you slow it down?

96
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:04,068
- Brakes don't do no good, Captain.
- We're gonna hit hard.

97
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:06,988
You'd better find a good hold.

98
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:10,129
- Good work, Sergeant.
- Have any trouble?

99
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:12,473
- Not much.
- Bide's handling the gold.

100
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:14,679
The horses are here.

101
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:22,901
You'll be all right, Jim.

102
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:29,321
- What happened?
- They greased the track.

103
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:33,201
They jumped us and knocked us out.
When I came to, the train was gone.

104
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:36,582
- Can you get this thing going?
- No, sir. All the steam is gone.

105
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,173
- So much booty!
- Hand me some.

106
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:56,432
We got plenty for everybody.

107
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:03,899
- We got the gold all right, sir.
- Get it loaded quickly.

108
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:06,401
It's heavy, Sarge.

109
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:09,486
Let's go. Keep it moving.

110
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:12,453
Corporal, get that wagon started.

111
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,070
Let's not take all day, men.

112
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,911
All right, move out.

113
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:40,054
- How is he, Corporal?
- He's got a bad cut on his shoulder.

114
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:43,025
- I'll be all right.
- What's the matter with your face?

115
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:47,529
- They threw a hornet's nest in the car.
- That's why we had to jump, sir.

116
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:53,326
- Where's Lieutenant Forsythe?
- Down the track. He's hurt pretty bad.

117
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,576
- Lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

118
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:59,917
Stand at ease. Fall out and give 'em
a hand here. Move forward!

119
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:16,474
Colonel McNally, over here.

120
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:30,655
Ned?

121
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:37,912
Sorry, sir. But we couldn't stay
in that car with all those hornets.

122
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:41,871
I know. Can you feel this?

123
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:46,415
Colonel, those Rebs had to know
beforehand about that gold.

124
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:49,964
- They sure as hell did.
- They sure got the jump on us.

125
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:55,432
- Can you feel this, Ned?
- No. It just feels numb, sir.

126
00:16:56,475 --> 00:16:59,144
Can you move your head?

127
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:01,725
No. But it doesn't hurt, sir.

128
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:04,607
- I'll be all right.
- Your neck's broken.

129
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:12,611
I'm sorry
I can't wait here with you, but...

130
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:14,947
I know, sir.

131
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:18,780
Colonel...

132
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:24,409
- Catch 'em, will ya?
- I will.

133
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:06,909
Corporal, get up in that car
and take a look-see.

134
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:14,918
Wyler, get on ahead of us,
see which way they took off.

135
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:17,379
Probably south.

136
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:21,263
Colonel, the gold's gone.
They got it, sir.

137
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:23,469
I thought so.

138
00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:26,225
Here, Colonel.

139
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,018
They had a wagon.
You can see the tracks. They split up.

140
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:36,152
Part of them went that way
with the wagon and the rest out there.

141
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:38,904
The wagon was heavy coming in
and heavy when it left.

142
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:41,361
The load could have come
from this pile of stones.

143
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:43,822
Maybe that's what
they wanted us to think.

144
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:48,584
- You mean the gold's on the wagon?
- Well, I'm goin' after the wagon.

145
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:52,211
You take half the troop
and follow those that went to the east.

146
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:55,092
Cartel,
you and your squad follow me.

147
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:59,382
And Lieutenant... If you catch 'em,
I want you to bring a couple back.

148
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:02,800
- And I want them to be able to talk.
- Yes, sir.

149
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:10,981
Follow me.

150
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:45,554
Jenkins. Check that trail.

151
00:19:55,404 --> 00:19:57,313
- Colonel.
- What is it?

152
00:19:57,447 --> 00:20:00,947
Here's a button from a Reb uniform.
Could have come this way.

153
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:05,240
- Could a wagon get up there?
- Not a chance.

154
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:09,915
You and Miller come with me
and the rest of you follow that trail.

155
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:26,635
If the gold was in the wagon,
they're packing it now.

156
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:31,181
- They came into the water here.
- They went upstream or downstream?

157
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:32,939
Who can say?

158
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:37,563
All right. You two go downstream
and I'll go upstream.

159
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:04,049
Hey, Johnny Reb,
stay right where you are!

160
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:12,185
Yank, I'm unarmed.

161
00:21:13,649 --> 00:21:16,815
That's what bothers me.
Turn around anyway.

162
00:21:25,536 --> 00:21:28,323
- Don't drown him.
- I won't.

163
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:32,532
He hit his head, Captain.

164
00:21:33,585 --> 00:21:35,827
Give us a hand here.

165
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:42,547
He's heavier than a baby whale!

166
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:50,345
- It's all quiet out there, Sergeant.
- Let's hope it stays that way, Captain.

167
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:05,441
You'd better leave that bandage alone,

168
00:22:05,576 --> 00:22:07,782
unless you want to start bleeding again.

169
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:11,327
- How do you feel?
- I hurt.

170
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:16,165
- You hit your head on a rock.
- I feel like a fool lettin' you take me.

171
00:22:16,295 --> 00:22:18,418
I would, too.

172
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:23,048
You haven't got a bad leg.
That bandage fooled me.

173
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:24,719
Bide over there loaned it to me.

174
00:22:24,845 --> 00:22:27,680
It's real blood, too, Colonel.
Made by a Yankee bullet.

175
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:31,851
- Who knocked me off my horse?
- Tuscarora, here.

176
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:35,061
I hurt a little, too, Colonel.
You're a big man.

177
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:39,932
You're the outfit
that's been taking our gold shipments.

178
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:44,232
- That's the fourth lot you've grabbed.
- The South needs money, Colonel.

179
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:47,235
I know you from someplace, don't I?

180
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:49,194
- You do.
- What's your name?

181
00:22:49,328 --> 00:22:51,285
Pierre Cordona.

182
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:53,904
French mother, Mexican father.
From New Orleans.

183
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:56,866
Four or five years ago in Abilene.

184
00:22:57,002 --> 00:22:59,410
- That's right.
- Something about a horse, wasn't it?

185
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:03,710
- Big bay horse. You stole it.
- The hell I did. I won it.

186
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:06,547
- You won a sorrel.
- The sorrel was lame.

187
00:23:06,678 --> 00:23:10,261
When you play poker, you should know
what you are playing for.

188
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:13,344
I remember.
We were both on that big bay.

189
00:23:13,477 --> 00:23:17,557
I was in front and you were behind
with a gun in my back.

190
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:21,438
- Your friends wanted to shoot me.
- I wasn't happy about it.

191
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:26,230
Colonel, I'd feel better
if you'd stay away from those rifles.

192
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:33,361
Neither one of us got hurt.
Tell me, what am I doin' in this rig?

193
00:23:33,497 --> 00:23:38,206
Well, Colonel, you used me
and now I'm going to use you.

194
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:41,538
This time you'll be in front
and get us out of here.

195
00:23:41,672 --> 00:23:45,254
If we run into any Yanks,
you'll be between us and them.

196
00:23:45,384 --> 00:23:49,251
- You'll get shot first.
- I don't know where all our units are.

197
00:23:49,388 --> 00:23:52,472
If you don't know,
you better guess pretty good.

198
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:55,553
I would start doing
a little thinking before we leave.

199
00:23:55,686 --> 00:23:59,766
- When are we leaving?
- As soon as it's dark.

200
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:11,197
- Do you have to tie my hands?
- Captain's orders.

201
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:16,662
Colonel, I'll be riding right behind you.
I can throw this knife pretty good.

202
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,495
- And it makes no noise.
- I hear you.

203
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:23,209
Douse that light.
Them in the back, too.

204
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:25,248
Get ready to move out.

205
00:25:01,585 --> 00:25:03,293
Captain!

206
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:09,582
- What is it, Corporal?
- Which direction is he taking us?

207
00:25:09,718 --> 00:25:13,502
South. I can't see the stars,
but we should be headin' south.

208
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:17,173
You're wrong. Which side of a tree
does moss grow on?

209
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:19,717
- The north side.
- The moss is on this side.

210
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:22,178
Right now we're goin' north.

211
00:25:22,314 --> 00:25:24,722
Sure. We're goin' north.

212
00:25:24,858 --> 00:25:27,812
Half of Sheridan's army
is south of here.

213
00:25:27,945 --> 00:25:31,989
The only way we can go is around 'em.
I don't know if I can get you through,

214
00:25:32,115 --> 00:25:35,484
but it's your idea, Captain,
and you're stuck with it.

215
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:40,530
You better not be trying something,
Colonel. You might be sorry for it.

216
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,076
Lead on.

217
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:01,135
Hold it, Colonel.

218
00:26:04,231 --> 00:26:07,516
We're getting near water
and I smell smoke.

219
00:26:07,651 --> 00:26:11,316
- Take a look, Sergeant.
- Better keep an eye on the Yank.

220
00:26:18,912 --> 00:26:22,696
- What do you think, Colonel?
- I can't keep track of every outfit.

221
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:24,909
Might be some of your Johnny Rebs.

222
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:45,224
- They're Yanks. A cavalry outfit.
- That'll be the 10th Ohio.

223
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:49,816
- They were 20 miles away yesterday.
- You're on track of where you are.

224
00:26:49,943 --> 00:26:53,063
- I try to, Sergeant.
- Can we go by them?

225
00:26:53,196 --> 00:26:58,273
- Better ask the Yank here.
- Best to go right by them, east.

226
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:02,277
Pass the word.
We're near a Yankee camp.

227
00:27:02,414 --> 00:27:05,498
Keep your horses quiet.
Use your hands if you have to.

228
00:27:05,626 --> 00:27:10,086
- How do I do that with mine tied?
- Cut him loose.

229
00:27:13,926 --> 00:27:17,793
- You be mighty careful, Colonel.
- I will.

230
00:27:18,889 --> 00:27:21,178
Go ahead. Slow.

231
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:51,708
See anything, Colonel?

232
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:57,417
Rebs on your flank. Look alive!
Get over here.

233
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,594
Every man for himself.

234
00:28:04,101 --> 00:28:08,893
Separate and ride south.
We'll meet back by the bridge.

235
00:28:09,022 --> 00:28:12,438
Don't lose that gold.
O'Brien, you and...

236
00:29:42,366 --> 00:29:46,315
Don't get nervous, Sergeant.
Just drop that pistol.

237
00:29:48,497 --> 00:29:52,577
Keep movin'.
Your Captain's over by that log.

238
00:29:58,674 --> 00:30:01,793
- What happened to him, Colonel?
- He hit his head.

239
00:30:01,927 --> 00:30:04,003
He's all right.
Wake him up.

240
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:18,850
- What's in that canteen, Sergeant?
- Corn liquor.

241
00:30:18,986 --> 00:30:21,144
I could use a little of that myself.

242
00:30:30,247 --> 00:30:32,121
Better be quiet.

243
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:36,120
Your Captain's in the wrong uniform,
remember?

244
00:30:41,258 --> 00:30:43,464
Well, Captain, how do you feel?

245
00:30:45,262 --> 00:30:49,591
Back in the cave you said
you felt like a fool. Now I do.

246
00:30:50,267 --> 00:30:52,758
I thought you gave in a little too easy.

247
00:30:52,895 --> 00:30:56,975
When we was goin' north to get away,
we was just goin' into trouble.

248
00:30:57,107 --> 00:31:01,899
- You wanted that gold bad.
- Not as bad as I wanted you two.

249
00:31:02,029 --> 00:31:05,563
Somebody in my outfit
had to be giving you information.

250
00:31:05,699 --> 00:31:09,068
- I want him.
- And you want us to tell you.

251
00:31:09,202 --> 00:31:12,868
Tell me and I'll cut you loose
and turn my back...

252
00:31:12,998 --> 00:31:16,449
The two of you will have
a good chance of getting away.

253
00:31:16,585 --> 00:31:20,417
Otherwise... you're a prisoner
in the wrong uniform.

254
00:31:20,547 --> 00:31:23,999
- You know what that can get you!
- Yeah, I know.

255
00:31:24,134 --> 00:31:26,921
And our boys lose all chance
of gettin' more gold.

256
00:31:27,054 --> 00:31:29,723
The war isn't over yet, Colonel.

257
00:31:30,891 --> 00:31:34,758
All right. Over here!

258
00:31:34,895 --> 00:31:38,098
- Captain. Hold up!
- Over here!

259
00:31:51,286 --> 00:31:54,038
Captain! Just got this.

260
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,629
Damn! All this for nothing!

261
00:32:24,695 --> 00:32:28,942
Give him a blanket, corporal.
Next man. You got boots and shoes?

262
00:32:29,074 --> 00:32:30,568
- Chills and fever?
- No, sir.

263
00:32:30,701 --> 00:32:32,777
- Any cramps?
- No.

264
00:32:32,911 --> 00:32:36,114
You will, when you have
that pork. Drink this.

265
00:32:36,248 --> 00:32:38,537
- Next man.
- Name, rank, unit.

266
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:42,368
Bide, lance corporal.
Tupelo Fusiliers.

267
00:32:42,504 --> 00:32:45,955
It was a small outfit, getting smaller.
Last I heard, I was all of it.

268
00:32:46,091 --> 00:32:48,214
Length of internment, eight months.

269
00:32:48,343 --> 00:32:50,632
Give that to the paymaster. Next.

270
00:32:50,762 --> 00:32:54,546
- You were right.
- I thought he'd be here.

271
00:32:54,683 --> 00:32:57,637
Cordona, Pierre. Captain.
1 st Louisiana Cavalry.

272
00:32:57,769 --> 00:33:00,307
You'll get two dollars, Captain.
Sign here.

273
00:33:00,439 --> 00:33:02,977
- You're entitled to your sword, Captain.
- Could I have a pistol?

274
00:33:03,108 --> 00:33:05,646
- No firearms.
- Never mind about the sword.

275
00:33:06,361 --> 00:33:09,398
Phillips, Tuscarora. Sergeant.
1 st Louisiana Cavalry.

276
00:33:13,952 --> 00:33:17,072
- Pierre and Tuscarora.
- You've got a good memory.

277
00:33:17,205 --> 00:33:19,412
Glad you weathered the storm.

278
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:22,293
It's the simple life -
no wine, no women, no song.

279
00:33:22,419 --> 00:33:25,088
- And no whisky.
- I can remedy that.

280
00:33:25,213 --> 00:33:27,502
You don't mind
drinking with a Blue Belly?

281
00:33:27,633 --> 00:33:31,251
- I'd drink with the devil himself.
- I feel just like he does.

282
00:33:31,386 --> 00:33:33,712
We're headed in the right direction.

283
00:33:45,067 --> 00:33:48,649
- Hi, Colonel.
- Hello, whisky for three.

284
00:33:49,571 --> 00:33:52,489
None of that cow purge!
Give us some whisky.

285
00:33:52,616 --> 00:33:55,533
But, Colonel, this is planter's stock.
Jamaican rum.

286
00:33:55,661 --> 00:33:58,448
- I paid dear for this.
- And you charge dear for it.

287
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:02,198
Give us that stuff on the bottom shelf.
Give me the bottle.

288
00:34:11,677 --> 00:34:15,211
Colonel,
I know why you want to see us.

289
00:34:15,347 --> 00:34:19,475
You haven't found the fella
who told us about your gold shipments.

290
00:34:19,601 --> 00:34:22,555
Who sold you the information
about our gold shipments.

291
00:34:22,688 --> 00:34:25,558
No, I haven't. But I will.

292
00:34:25,691 --> 00:34:27,814
You make it sound personal, Colonel.

293
00:34:27,943 --> 00:34:30,944
A boy that I watched grow up

294
00:34:31,071 --> 00:34:33,906
was in that car that you threw
the hornets into.

295
00:34:34,032 --> 00:34:36,025
Was he hurt bad?

296
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,611
- We buried him the next day.
- I'm sorry.

297
00:34:39,746 --> 00:34:42,617
We killed your friend,
but you don't hold that against us.

298
00:34:42,749 --> 00:34:45,834
What you did was an act of war.

299
00:34:45,961 --> 00:34:51,121
But selling information, that's treason.
Rotten treachery for money.

300
00:34:51,258 --> 00:34:54,342
- I want the name of that man.
- There were two.

301
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:56,795
I don't know their names.
We gave them money.

302
00:34:56,930 --> 00:35:00,097
- They gave us the information.
- Can you describe them?

303
00:35:00,225 --> 00:35:03,808
One was a big man.
Almost as big as you.

304
00:35:03,937 --> 00:35:06,607
The other one... You were closer.

305
00:35:06,732 --> 00:35:09,567
The other fella,
even in the dark he stood out.

306
00:35:09,693 --> 00:35:13,394
He was like an albino.
White hair, white skin. Smaller man.

307
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:17,480
- That's all.
- That's more than I had.

308
00:35:17,618 --> 00:35:19,776
You fellas can do me a favour.

309
00:35:19,912 --> 00:35:23,031
If you run into either of them,
let me know.

310
00:35:23,165 --> 00:35:25,039
You can be sure of that.

311
00:35:25,876 --> 00:35:28,331
- Another drink?
- Let us buy you a drink.

312
00:35:28,462 --> 00:35:31,297
What did you get
when you signed out?

313
00:35:31,423 --> 00:35:32,882
Two dollars.

314
00:35:33,008 --> 00:35:36,294
- Where are you heading?
- I'll just look around.

315
00:35:36,428 --> 00:35:38,468
I'm going back to Texas.

316
00:35:38,597 --> 00:35:41,052
The man who brought me up
has a ranch in Rio Lobo.

317
00:35:41,183 --> 00:35:43,590
Two dollars won't get you very far.

318
00:35:43,727 --> 00:35:48,021
Since you've been locked up, our pay's
been coming through regularly.

319
00:35:48,148 --> 00:35:50,639
That'll get you to Texas.
You can owe me.

320
00:35:50,776 --> 00:35:53,445
I never thought
I'd want to kiss a Yank.

321
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:58,909
If we run into one of those fellas
you're after, where can we reach you?

322
00:35:59,034 --> 00:36:02,818
Blackthorne, Texas.
That's near your Rio Lobo country.

323
00:36:02,955 --> 00:36:05,362
The Sheriff there
can get in touch with me.

324
00:36:24,518 --> 00:36:30,022
I see the Sheriff of Blackthorne County
has earned some bounty money.

325
00:36:30,148 --> 00:36:34,277
One of these little hides
can buy a lot of drinks.

326
00:36:34,403 --> 00:36:36,479
- Good to see you.
- Thanks.

327
00:36:36,613 --> 00:36:38,606
I was wonderin' when you'd show up.

328
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:42,074
I got your message
that Pierre Cordona wanted to see me.

329
00:36:42,202 --> 00:36:44,527
Yeah. He got in last night.

330
00:36:44,663 --> 00:36:48,364
He's at the hotel.
Come on in. I'll give you a drink.

331
00:36:49,293 --> 00:36:53,871
What's it all about, Cord?
Can you tell me why you're here?

332
00:36:55,382 --> 00:37:00,293
Didn't Cordona grab
a coupla army payrolls from the Yanks?

333
00:37:00,429 --> 00:37:01,757
That's right.

334
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:05,720
I heard that you captured him
and put him in a prison camp.

335
00:37:05,851 --> 00:37:07,890
You heard right.

336
00:37:09,563 --> 00:37:15,067
Cord, you're not fixing on causing
any trouble? I wouldn't like that.

337
00:37:15,193 --> 00:37:17,020
Don't worry, Pat.

338
00:37:17,154 --> 00:37:19,561
Besides, you're too good
for that young fella.

339
00:37:19,698 --> 00:37:23,197
There's no hard feelings between us.
The war's over.

340
00:37:23,327 --> 00:37:26,577
Oh, that's good.
Then why do you want to see him?

341
00:37:26,705 --> 00:37:30,204
The only reason Cordona
could get away with those payrolls,

342
00:37:30,334 --> 00:37:34,462
was because some people on
our side were selling him information.

343
00:37:34,588 --> 00:37:36,545
I'm after them.

344
00:37:36,673 --> 00:37:40,338
Are you working for the army,
or is this personal?

345
00:37:40,469 --> 00:37:42,342
Both.

346
00:37:42,471 --> 00:37:46,338
Sheriff, I'd say
you were going to have company.

347
00:37:46,475 --> 00:37:50,555
- Which of you is the Sheriff?
- I'm Pat Cronin. If there's anything...

348
00:37:50,687 --> 00:37:54,471
I want to report a murder. And I want
the man who did it arrested.

349
00:37:54,608 --> 00:37:56,814
- Where'd this happen?
- In Rio Lobo.

350
00:37:56,944 --> 00:37:59,695
I'm sorry,
that's out of my jurisdiction.

351
00:37:59,821 --> 00:38:04,115
- You're not going to do anything?
- Excuse me. You said Rio Lobo...

352
00:38:04,243 --> 00:38:08,323
Are you connected
with the Sheriff's office?

353
00:38:08,455 --> 00:38:11,326
- No, I...
- Will you please stay out of this?

354
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:14,827
Sheriff, does that mean
you're not going to do anything?

355
00:38:14,962 --> 00:38:17,453
It means I can't do anything.
I have no authority there.

356
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:18,752
A man was killed...

357
00:38:18,882 --> 00:38:22,666
Unless a US Marshal
or the Sheriff of Rio Lobo asks me...

358
00:38:22,844 --> 00:38:26,510
You know the Sheriff of Rio Lobo
and you know he won't ask you.

359
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,885
I know.

360
00:38:28,016 --> 00:38:31,183
The man who committed the murder
was one of his deputies.

361
00:38:32,729 --> 00:38:34,058
I'm sorry, miss.

362
00:38:34,189 --> 00:38:37,439
Well, so am I. I just thought...

363
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,649
So am I!

364
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:51,369
- Who is the Sheriff of Rio Lobo?
- Tom Hendricks.

365
00:38:52,374 --> 00:38:55,873
- Blue Tom?
- That's right. Ever run into him?

366
00:38:56,003 --> 00:39:00,214
I chased him enough,
but I never got lucky.

367
00:39:01,258 --> 00:39:03,381
- How about that drink?
- I'm out.

368
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:05,419
As usual. I'll buy you one.

369
00:39:12,603 --> 00:39:14,476
Town's growing up, Pat.

370
00:39:19,234 --> 00:39:22,152
- Morning, Hank.
- Morning. Can I help you?

371
00:39:22,279 --> 00:39:24,272
I'd like you to meet my friend
Cord McNally.

372
00:39:24,406 --> 00:39:25,604
- Glad to meet you.
- Thank you.

373
00:39:25,741 --> 00:39:29,489
- I'm looking for a Pierre Cordona.
- Room 19.

374
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:32,490
- Key's gone.
- He's up there all right.

375
00:39:32,623 --> 00:39:36,620
Just a minute.
He left a message about something.

376
00:39:36,752 --> 00:39:41,829
He'll shoot anybody who wakes him up
unless the building is on fire.

377
00:39:41,965 --> 00:39:46,876
He gave me two dollars
to see that nobody started a fire.

378
00:39:47,012 --> 00:39:50,179
Two dollars will buy
a lot of sleep around here.

379
00:39:50,307 --> 00:39:53,391
- I guess we can wait.
- How about that drink?

380
00:39:53,936 --> 00:39:56,059
And remember, you're buying.

381
00:39:56,188 --> 00:39:58,311
- Hello, Jane.
- Hello, Sheriff.

382
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,013
Sit down. Give us a bottle, Jim.

383
00:40:06,114 --> 00:40:08,237
Little Miss Busybody.

384
00:40:19,002 --> 00:40:23,997
She'll either be in the jail or the hotel.
Chuck, take a look in the jail.

385
00:40:36,311 --> 00:40:39,016
- Nobody in the jail, Whitey.
- All right.

386
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:44,438
George, you go around the back.
Come in that way.

387
00:40:47,823 --> 00:40:49,981
You two come with me.

388
00:40:59,293 --> 00:41:01,036
Pat.

389
00:41:10,345 --> 00:41:13,382
Well, young lady.
You gave us quite a chase.

390
00:41:13,515 --> 00:41:18,260
Sheriff, this is the man that I wanted
you to arrest. He's the murderer.

391
00:41:18,395 --> 00:41:21,562
That may give the Sheriff
the wrong idea about me.

392
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:24,228
It was self-defence.
He tried to knife me.

393
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:25,474
That's a lie!

394
00:41:25,611 --> 00:41:30,189
Hold on, I can handle this.
What exactly is your business here?

395
00:41:30,324 --> 00:41:34,950
Name's Carter. Whitey Carter.
I'm a deputy from Rio Lobo.

396
00:41:35,078 --> 00:41:38,198
As to my business,
I came lookin' for her. She's wanted.

397
00:41:38,332 --> 00:41:39,660
What for?

398
00:41:39,791 --> 00:41:44,038
She and the old man she lived with
ran one of them medicine shows.

399
00:41:44,171 --> 00:41:48,749
You know, snake oil, crooked
shell games, pick a few pockets...

400
00:41:48,884 --> 00:41:52,087
That's another lie. I didn't do anything.

401
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:56,717
Sheriff in Rio Lobo just wants to talk
to her, so I'll take her along with us.

402
00:41:56,850 --> 00:42:02,010
Just a minute. I'm the Sheriff
of Blackthorne. I want to see a warrant.

403
00:42:02,147 --> 00:42:05,433
- A warrant?
- For the young lady's arrest.

404
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:07,441
I never thought about that.

405
00:42:07,569 --> 00:42:09,977
Without a warrant,
you're not taking anybody.

406
00:42:10,113 --> 00:42:12,106
I got a warrant right here, Sheriff.

407
00:42:13,909 --> 00:42:18,785
Satisfied, Sheriff?
Now, drop your gun and go sit down.

408
00:42:20,332 --> 00:42:24,246
All right, everyone stand still.
No one gets hurt.

409
00:42:25,003 --> 00:42:26,166
Come on.

410
00:42:34,638 --> 00:42:36,132
Look out!

411
00:42:46,567 --> 00:42:50,185
- Did they hit you, Pat?
- No, I did it myself when I hit the floor.

412
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,562
You're getting too old.

413
00:42:52,698 --> 00:42:56,316
Hello, Captain.
I'm glad you joined us when you did.

414
00:42:56,451 --> 00:42:59,867
I heard the racket and knew it was you.
How did it start?

415
00:42:59,997 --> 00:43:03,496
This young lady here
shot that white-haired man.

416
00:43:03,625 --> 00:43:07,290
- She really didn't want to go with him!
- Can you blame her?

417
00:43:07,421 --> 00:43:09,663
This was one
of the fellas you were hunting.

418
00:43:09,798 --> 00:43:13,297
- Well, I never! Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

419
00:43:13,427 --> 00:43:15,254
Is he dead?

420
00:43:15,387 --> 00:43:18,554
- Unfortunately, yes.
- Did I kill him?

421
00:43:18,682 --> 00:43:21,090
Not entirely, but you sure helped.

422
00:43:21,226 --> 00:43:25,555
Well, I couldn't let him take me.
I'd rather be dead.

423
00:43:25,689 --> 00:43:29,817
- You damned near got us all killed.
- I'm sorry...

424
00:43:30,569 --> 00:43:33,024
Are you gonna faint?

425
00:43:35,282 --> 00:43:39,410
- What'll I do with her?
- Bring her up to my room.

426
00:43:41,204 --> 00:43:44,988
- Where is it?
- Up on the left. The door is open.

427
00:43:51,882 --> 00:43:53,341
There's somebody in there.

428
00:43:53,467 --> 00:43:57,464
Oh, I forgot.
Come on, Mable. Get out.

429
00:43:57,596 --> 00:43:59,635
Come on. Move on.

430
00:43:59,765 --> 00:44:03,181
- Why can't I sleep?
- I'll explain later. Come on.

431
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:07,260
Is that what I'm leaving for?
I thought you were a gentleman.

432
00:44:07,397 --> 00:44:11,181
- You've been busy.
- Just keeping out of trouble.

433
00:44:12,194 --> 00:44:16,238
Hank, go get the undertaker.
Never mind. Here he comes.

434
00:44:16,365 --> 00:44:18,606
I heard some shooting, Sheriff.
Do you need me?

435
00:44:18,742 --> 00:44:22,906
I got a lot of work for you. One there.
Two over here and one in the corner.

436
00:44:23,038 --> 00:44:25,031
I'll get right at it.

437
00:44:27,751 --> 00:44:29,909
What did you find out?

438
00:44:30,045 --> 00:44:34,292
I talked to the stage driver
that brought the girl from Rio Lobo.

439
00:44:34,424 --> 00:44:37,425
He said he picked her up
a couple of miles out of town.

440
00:44:37,552 --> 00:44:40,044
She was tellin' the truth all right.

441
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:44,807
He was after her and he shot
the old man with the medicine wagon.

442
00:44:44,935 --> 00:44:48,351
What did Tuscarora say in that letter?

443
00:44:49,564 --> 00:44:53,432
Only that he saw one of the men
you were after. A man with white hair.

444
00:44:53,569 --> 00:44:58,527
- That'll be Whitey from downstairs.
- Whitey worked for a rich Yankee.

445
00:44:58,657 --> 00:45:01,065
Tuscarora hasn't seen this Yankee.

446
00:45:01,201 --> 00:45:04,072
But you didn't come all the way
to Blackthorne to tell me that.

447
00:45:04,204 --> 00:45:09,246
Tuscarora's in trouble. They're trying
to take his old man's land.

448
00:45:09,376 --> 00:45:13,290
- And you thought I'd join in?
- Two guns are better than one.

449
00:45:13,422 --> 00:45:16,257
Maybe we're after the same thing.

450
00:45:16,383 --> 00:45:18,672
Maybe I can help you.

451
00:45:18,802 --> 00:45:23,760
Well, I reckon I'm in. I'll go as far
as Rio Lobo and we'll find out.

452
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:27,674
- What did you just say?
- Well, how do you feel?

453
00:45:27,811 --> 00:45:32,936
I don't know. Aren't you the man
that came downstairs...

454
00:45:33,066 --> 00:45:35,355
...and helped us
when we needed it.

455
00:45:35,485 --> 00:45:38,605
Pierre Cordona, Miss...
What is your name?

456
00:45:38,739 --> 00:45:41,111
It's Shasta - Shasta Delaney.

457
00:45:41,241 --> 00:45:44,361
You don't have
any pants on, Mr Cordona.

458
00:45:44,494 --> 00:45:47,780
- I didn't have time after the shooting.
- You have time now.

459
00:45:47,915 --> 00:45:51,414
- Why don't you put them on?
- Cos you're lying on them.

460
00:45:56,173 --> 00:46:00,384
- You don't have many clothes on too.
- Who took my clothes off?

461
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:02,053
- I did.
- Why?

462
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:05,382
- We flipped a coin and I won.
- I've never heard anything...

463
00:46:05,515 --> 00:46:10,142
Haven't you heard of loosening
a person's clothes when they faint?

464
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:15,016
Oh, yes.
I guess I'm acting like an idiot, aren't I?

465
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:18,685
- I'd say almost.
- Yeah, I'd say so, too.

466
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:21,062
You suppose I could have a drink?

467
00:46:21,198 --> 00:46:25,030
- You're not gonna faint again, are you?
- No, Mr McNally.

468
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,402
Do you only take a drink
when you're about to faint?

469
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:31,165
I'd hardly say that, miss.

470
00:46:35,254 --> 00:46:37,460
You all right?

471
00:46:39,925 --> 00:46:44,136
Oh, didn't I hear you say something
about going to Rio Lobo?

472
00:46:44,263 --> 00:46:47,050
- You did.
- Good. I'm going with you.

473
00:46:47,182 --> 00:46:50,136
- You? Oh, no you're not.
- Don't be silly.

474
00:46:50,894 --> 00:46:55,889
How much do you know about
Rio Lobo? You've never been there.

475
00:46:56,024 --> 00:47:00,603
You don't know where to go,
who to talk to or who's an enemy.

476
00:47:00,737 --> 00:47:03,359
- I can help.
- Why do you want to go?

477
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:10,027
I want to get my wagon.
Old Charlie wanted me to have it.

478
00:47:11,623 --> 00:47:13,995
Every time I think about him I...

479
00:47:16,545 --> 00:47:21,254
- Anyway, it's all I own.
- You can't ride in that outfit.

480
00:47:21,383 --> 00:47:24,384
If you get me a horse
I'll be ready in ten minutes.

481
00:47:24,511 --> 00:47:30,596
When you get the troops paraded,
let me know. I'll be in the bar.

482
00:47:33,812 --> 00:47:35,888
There she is.

483
00:47:36,565 --> 00:47:38,972
I'll take that.

484
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:43,645
- How far is it to Rio Lobo?
- 70 or 80 miles.

485
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:47,031
- Took three days on the stage.
- It'll take us longer.

486
00:47:48,619 --> 00:47:52,201
We forgot something.
Can she ride? Can you?

487
00:47:52,331 --> 00:47:57,123
- Which side do you get on?
- Left side. I knew it.

488
00:48:07,846 --> 00:48:11,760
- You're a good teacher, Frenchy!
- Yeah.

489
00:48:43,465 --> 00:48:47,677
This looks a good place to bed down.
It's cold, but it'll get colder.

490
00:48:47,803 --> 00:48:50,424
I'll see what I can find to make a fire.

491
00:48:50,555 --> 00:48:54,505
Shasta, you don't have a bottle
of that snake oil, do you?

492
00:48:54,643 --> 00:48:57,312
- I just happen to have some.
- Good.

493
00:49:20,294 --> 00:49:24,243
Hey, what are you so happy about,
Colonel?

494
00:49:24,381 --> 00:49:28,046
Well, I've had about
the right number of drinks,

495
00:49:28,176 --> 00:49:31,795
and I am warm, and I'm relaxed.

496
00:49:33,724 --> 00:49:35,847
Well, if you gentle people...

497
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:43,847
...can manage without me,
I shall go to sleep. Good night.

498
00:49:47,362 --> 00:49:49,438
I'm freezing.

499
00:49:50,198 --> 00:49:52,274
This will help.

500
00:49:57,205 --> 00:49:59,875
Don't do that. I don't like it.

501
00:50:00,167 --> 00:50:04,496
- I'm sorry. I was going to...
- I'm tired of being pawed.

502
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:07,417
What happened?
What made you say that?

503
00:50:07,549 --> 00:50:12,092
- Why go into it?
- Because I'd like to know.

504
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,340
All right.

505
00:50:16,058 --> 00:50:19,427
I was married.
It wasn't a good marriage.

506
00:50:19,561 --> 00:50:22,432
He couldn't drink, but he did anyway.

507
00:50:22,564 --> 00:50:25,020
And when he did, he wasn't good.

508
00:50:25,859 --> 00:50:27,935
When he drank, he'd gamble.

509
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:31,106
And when he lost,
he thought he'd been cheated.

510
00:50:31,239 --> 00:50:33,813
I don't know if he was or not.

511
00:50:33,951 --> 00:50:37,948
But the other guy was faster
and a good shot.

512
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,867
So I had to get a job.

513
00:50:41,375 --> 00:50:44,126
Do you know
what it's like to work in a saloon?

514
00:50:44,253 --> 00:50:49,164
- No.
- They never leave you alone.

515
00:50:50,467 --> 00:50:51,926
Never.

516
00:50:55,347 --> 00:50:58,597
Then good old Charlie Simms
came along.

517
00:50:58,725 --> 00:51:02,011
The only man who was ever nice to me.

518
00:51:02,145 --> 00:51:04,553
And they killed him.

519
00:51:07,067 --> 00:51:12,607
- Do you have any more questions?
- Yeah. What are you gonna do now?

520
00:51:13,407 --> 00:51:17,321
- I'm going to bed.
- I mean after this is all over?

521
00:51:20,789 --> 00:51:27,503
I going to get Charlie's wagon
and then I'm going to... I don't know.

522
00:51:27,629 --> 00:51:30,085
You can't run a medicine show
by yourself.

523
00:51:30,215 --> 00:51:34,462
I'm pretty good at getting people
to buy that Apache Herb Tonic.

524
00:51:34,595 --> 00:51:38,129
Something will turn up.
It always does.

525
00:51:39,933 --> 00:51:43,349
You know... I like you.

526
00:51:45,188 --> 00:51:47,893
- Why?
- Cos you don't cry.

527
00:51:48,025 --> 00:51:51,394
Oh, but I do. You saw me.

528
00:51:51,528 --> 00:51:54,363
You cried for your friend,
not for yourself.

529
00:51:54,489 --> 00:51:56,731
There's a lot of difference.

530
00:51:59,036 --> 00:52:02,120
Don't be nice to me, please.

531
00:52:05,083 --> 00:52:06,957
Wait.

532
00:52:10,464 --> 00:52:12,871
- I didn't figure...
- Didn't you want me to do that?

533
00:52:13,008 --> 00:52:16,756
Sure I did. But I'm generally
the one who starts it.

534
00:52:16,887 --> 00:52:21,596
That's why I started it.
Cos now I know when it'll stop.

535
00:52:21,725 --> 00:52:24,512
Well, I would...

536
00:52:24,645 --> 00:52:26,933
Oh, good night.

537
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:02,884
Pierre, see these poles above me?

538
00:53:03,016 --> 00:53:06,053
- Mm-hm.
- I can't figure out what they're for.

539
00:53:06,186 --> 00:53:08,013
They're all burnt.

540
00:53:08,146 --> 00:53:12,358
I'd say they were used
by the Indians to bury their dead.

541
00:53:12,484 --> 00:53:16,185
They put the bodies on the poles
and burned them.

542
00:53:16,321 --> 00:53:19,773
- Probably, you're sleeping on a skull...
- What?

543
00:53:43,432 --> 00:53:46,267
Hey! Hey!

544
00:53:47,227 --> 00:53:49,469
How about waking up?

545
00:53:53,775 --> 00:53:56,812
- How did she get here?
- Ask her.

546
00:53:57,988 --> 00:53:59,981
Hey, you!

547
00:54:00,115 --> 00:54:06,070
- How'd you get here.
- When you were sleeping. It was cold.

548
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:08,999
Why me? Why didn't you pick on him?

549
00:54:09,124 --> 00:54:12,991
He's young. I thought...
Well, you're older.

550
00:54:13,128 --> 00:54:15,536
- You're comfortable.
- Comfortable?

551
00:54:15,672 --> 00:54:18,839
I've been called a lot of things,
but "comfortable"!

552
00:54:18,967 --> 00:54:23,676
I'll say this. You're a lot better
than a hot brick to keep a man warm.

553
00:54:24,389 --> 00:54:26,715
It's nice to be appreciated.

554
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:31,346
- Is that coffee I smell?
- It is. Get up and have some.

555
00:54:32,689 --> 00:54:34,848
Rise and shine.

556
00:54:57,714 --> 00:54:59,506
Come on.

557
00:55:17,401 --> 00:55:22,561
- This is Rio Lobo. Take a look.
- Looks quiet enough.

558
00:55:22,698 --> 00:55:25,319
It's too late to start anything now.

559
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:29,578
Where does Tuscarora's girlfriend live?
You said we could hole up there.

560
00:55:29,705 --> 00:55:33,453
Yes, she's on the edge of town.
There's a corral nearby for the horses.

561
00:55:33,584 --> 00:55:35,991
Can we get there without being seen?

562
00:55:36,128 --> 00:55:38,963
Yes, if you can get across the street.

563
00:55:40,132 --> 00:55:42,967
- Take a look, Frenchy.
- Right.

564
00:56:22,883 --> 00:56:26,501
It's me, Shasta. Hurry, Maria.

565
00:56:33,518 --> 00:56:35,143
Oh, Shasta.

566
00:56:36,063 --> 00:56:40,440
Listen, these are friends of Tuscarora's.
They're here to help Mr Phillips.

567
00:56:40,567 --> 00:56:45,644
This is Captain Cordona.
And this is Colonel McNally.

568
00:56:45,781 --> 00:56:50,193
- We need somewhere to stay tonight.
- But the horses...?

569
00:56:50,327 --> 00:56:53,363
- It's not good to have them here.
- Where's a good place?

570
00:56:53,497 --> 00:56:56,830
Over there's an empty house. See?

571
00:56:56,959 --> 00:56:59,450
You will find a corral on your right.

572
00:56:59,586 --> 00:57:03,915
- All right. I'll take them.
- Be careful. They're watching.

573
00:57:04,049 --> 00:57:08,094
- Why did you come back here?
- Maria, it's a long story.

574
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:12,004
But first, tell me what have Ketcham
and the Sheriff been doing?

575
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:15,592
They've been after Phillips
to sell his ranch.

576
00:57:15,727 --> 00:57:17,803
- Has he sold it?
- I don't know.

577
00:57:17,938 --> 00:57:21,271
I haven't seen Tuscarora
since you went away.

578
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,855
Everybody is afraid here.

579
00:57:23,986 --> 00:57:25,895
The Sheriff's men
are watching everywhere.

580
00:57:26,029 --> 00:57:28,355
- They're watching this house?
- Everywhere.

581
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:30,815
It's not safe for you to stay here.

582
00:57:30,951 --> 00:57:34,154
We have to stay here tonight.
We haven't eaten.

583
00:57:34,288 --> 00:57:38,665
I'm sorry, I didn't think.
I'll just prepare something for you.

584
00:58:50,197 --> 00:58:53,530
I'm sorry. Someone's chasing me.
I've no other place to go.

585
00:58:53,742 --> 00:58:56,031
- You don't have to go.
- What?

586
00:58:57,454 --> 00:58:59,696
You can stay here.

587
00:59:00,958 --> 00:59:05,086
- Could you put that light out?
- As you wish.

588
00:59:09,591 --> 00:59:13,292
Thanks. Don't stand
in the middle of the room.

589
00:59:19,434 --> 00:59:22,684
- Can you see anyone?
- I don't see a soul.

590
00:59:22,813 --> 00:59:25,351
- Would you like me to look?
- I'm looking.

591
00:59:25,482 --> 00:59:29,811
- Yes, but I could go outside.
- You'd better put some clothes on first.

592
00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:34,236
- As you wish.
- No, I didn't mean that.

593
00:59:34,366 --> 00:59:38,862
- I don't think you should go out there.
- Well... we could stay here.

594
00:59:41,581 --> 00:59:46,078
I have plenty of tortillas and beans
and chilli and even some wine.

595
00:59:46,211 --> 00:59:50,256
- Sounds good. I wish I could stay.
- Why not?

596
00:59:50,382 --> 00:59:54,510
Because I think they're gone now.
I must get back to my friends.

597
00:59:54,636 --> 00:59:58,551
- I'm sorry.
- I don't know how to thank you.

598
00:59:58,682 --> 01:00:02,133
- You don't have to.
- My name is Pierre. What's yours?

599
01:00:02,269 --> 01:00:05,353
- Thank you, Amelita.
- Wait a minute.

600
01:00:09,192 --> 01:00:11,185
It's all right.

601
01:00:18,368 --> 01:00:20,491
That smells good.

602
01:00:24,499 --> 01:00:27,666
- Come in.
- Where have you been?

603
01:00:27,794 --> 01:00:30,879
I put the horses away
and I was hiding.

604
01:00:31,006 --> 01:00:34,541
- Hiding? From whom?
- From the people that watch the town.

605
01:00:34,676 --> 01:00:38,128
- I told you. Where were you?
- In a house of a girl.

606
01:00:38,263 --> 01:00:42,131
A girl? Pretty fast worker.
Where did you meet her?

607
01:00:42,267 --> 01:00:46,763
I crashed the door and there she was.
She's pretty. Dark hair.

608
01:00:46,897 --> 01:00:50,645
- And I think her name's Amelita.
- I know her. She's a friend of mine.

609
01:00:50,776 --> 01:00:53,349
- Well, she helped me.
- I hope you had fun.

610
01:00:53,487 --> 01:00:55,729
Stop it.
What are we gonna do now?

611
01:00:55,864 --> 01:00:57,738
We'll stay here tonight.

612
01:00:57,866 --> 01:01:00,404
In the morning I'll go into town
to see what I can find out.

613
01:01:00,535 --> 01:01:02,575
Why don't we go into Phillip's ranch...

614
01:01:02,704 --> 01:01:05,824
If they're watching this town,
they're certainly watching the ranch.

615
01:01:05,958 --> 01:01:08,246
- The Sheriff knows you, doesn't he?
- He does.

616
01:01:08,377 --> 01:01:11,331
He'll want to know
what you're doing here.

617
01:01:11,463 --> 01:01:14,797
He wants to know
all about any stranger.

618
01:01:14,925 --> 01:01:20,714
Wrap up your wrist and say you hurt
yourself and you're looking for a doctor.

619
01:01:20,847 --> 01:01:26,055
The dentist's a friend of Tuscarora
and Mr Phillips. He can tell you much.

620
01:01:26,186 --> 01:01:30,729
I feel a toothache coming on.
I hope you have plenty of wine, Maria.

621
01:02:01,388 --> 01:02:03,961
Thanks. See they get some water.

622
01:02:04,099 --> 01:02:06,175
- I'll be back in a while.
- Be careful.

623
01:02:22,951 --> 01:02:26,071
- It's been a long time, Maria.
- All right, boys, come on.

624
01:02:28,123 --> 01:02:31,077
Tuscarora. Come here.

625
01:02:38,258 --> 01:02:39,717
You wanna see me?

626
01:02:39,843 --> 01:02:43,378
You just brought some horses
into town. Are they yours?

627
01:02:43,513 --> 01:02:46,301
- They're ours.
- I think some were stolen.

628
01:02:46,433 --> 01:02:48,390
That's a lie.

629
01:02:48,518 --> 01:02:51,140
No. Leave him alone!

630
01:02:51,271 --> 01:02:52,813
Stop it!

631
01:02:54,358 --> 01:02:56,730
Stop this wicked thing!

632
01:03:14,294 --> 01:03:16,002
That's enough.

633
01:03:19,716 --> 01:03:20,795
What's going on?

634
01:03:20,926 --> 01:03:24,971
We're teaching him some manners.
He's been stealing horses.

635
01:03:27,224 --> 01:03:31,056
We gotta save enough of him to hang.
Take him over to the jail.

636
01:03:31,186 --> 01:03:33,807
Come on. On your feet.

637
01:03:35,816 --> 01:03:39,481
- Bring the girl, too.
- Why?

638
01:03:46,493 --> 01:03:48,984
Are you all right, lady?

639
01:03:52,749 --> 01:03:55,454
You'd better go on home.

640
01:03:57,838 --> 01:03:59,462
Go on!

641
01:04:00,590 --> 01:04:03,046
You're kinda new around here,
aren't you?

642
01:04:03,802 --> 01:04:06,838
- Got in this morning.
- Figure on staying long?

643
01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:13,385
- Bum tooth.
- Doc, got a customer for you.

644
01:04:14,855 --> 01:04:17,097
Oh, and, mister...

645
01:04:17,232 --> 01:04:20,933
After you get that tooth fixed,
just amble on out of town.

646
01:04:22,738 --> 01:04:24,979
Sounds like good advice.

647
01:04:28,577 --> 01:04:31,910
- Doctor...
- Come on in, sir.

648
01:04:39,087 --> 01:04:43,417
Keep an eye on that big fella.
See if he really has a bad tooth.

649
01:04:46,553 --> 01:04:49,673
- So you've got a bad tooth?
- No, I haven't.

650
01:04:49,806 --> 01:04:53,092
- Get in the chair.
- I told you, my tooth's all right.

651
01:04:54,227 --> 01:04:57,228
- Can't we just talk?
- See that fella over there?

652
01:04:57,356 --> 01:05:00,226
He's checking out
your story on your tooth.

653
01:05:00,359 --> 01:05:05,104
- Open real wide.
- I can't talk with my mouth open.

654
01:05:05,238 --> 01:05:08,405
I'll ask the questions,
you just nod or shake your head.

655
01:05:08,533 --> 01:05:12,365
Now, that girl, Maria, the one that got
knocked around... she send you?

656
01:05:12,496 --> 01:05:16,078
- Yeah.
- I thought so, the way you bolted here.

657
01:05:16,208 --> 01:05:17,832
That hurts.

658
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:21,163
Most of my patients yell a lot.
Take a look out there.

659
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:32,514
He's gone.
Is that my tooth?

660
01:05:32,641 --> 01:05:34,847
No. Yours are fine.

661
01:05:34,977 --> 01:05:37,550
Tell me what's going on around here.

662
01:05:37,688 --> 01:05:43,393
The man running things is Ketcham.
He came here right after the war.

663
01:05:43,527 --> 01:05:49,031
Hendricks killed our old Sheriff and
Ketcham made him the new Sheriff.

664
01:05:50,951 --> 01:05:54,534
- Look out there.
- Wish I could hear what they're saying.

665
01:05:54,663 --> 01:05:57,201
Don't have to... blackmail.

666
01:05:58,542 --> 01:06:00,700
If they do things
the way they've been doing,

667
01:06:00,836 --> 01:06:04,703
Hendricks will send his bullyboys
out to Old Man Phillips' ranch.

668
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:08,505
They'll run off all his stock,
so he's on foot.

669
01:06:08,635 --> 01:06:11,838
Then they'll tell him the way
to keep his boy from being hanged

670
01:06:11,972 --> 01:06:16,385
is to sign over his ranch to them
for a quarter of what it's worth.

671
01:06:16,518 --> 01:06:19,602
I know that old man.
He's stubborn as hell.

672
01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:21,971
But he dearly loves that boy.

673
01:06:22,899 --> 01:06:26,944
So they'll keep him there till he cracks
and signs over his land.

674
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:30,024
Ketcham's been pickin' up a lot of land.

675
01:06:30,157 --> 01:06:34,866
- All of it that's any good, Mr...?
- Doesn't matter.

676
01:06:35,537 --> 01:06:39,072
Well, Mr Doesn't Matter,
I hope you can do something.

677
01:06:39,207 --> 01:06:42,991
- You got plenty of help?
- Well, no. I haven't.

678
01:06:43,128 --> 01:06:46,995
God be with you.
I still wish you luck.

679
01:06:47,132 --> 01:06:49,670
We ought to give
one more good yell.

680
01:06:49,801 --> 01:06:53,005
They usually yell a lot
when I give 'em a shot of this.

681
01:06:54,932 --> 01:06:57,090
That's the real stuff.

682
01:06:57,225 --> 01:07:00,926
If you were a good enough actor,
I wouldn't have used it.

683
01:07:01,063 --> 01:07:03,518
That'll be a dollar six bits.

684
01:07:04,608 --> 01:07:08,392
- Would four bits be just as good?
- Just as good.

685
01:07:09,905 --> 01:07:14,318
- Thank you, Mr Doesn't Matter.
- McNally. I'll be seeing you.

686
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:26,663
You must hide. Maria says
the Sheriff is sending some men here.

687
01:07:27,255 --> 01:07:31,502
- Where can we hide in here?
- Under the bed. Hurry.

688
01:07:31,635 --> 01:07:36,511
Wait a minute.
First, pour some water over my head.

689
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:44,306
- All of it?
- Yes, go ahead.

690
01:07:56,535 --> 01:07:59,489
- Who is it?
- Open up.

691
01:07:59,621 --> 01:08:02,159
- Just a minute.
- Hurry it up.

692
01:08:02,291 --> 01:08:04,164
Just a minute.

693
01:08:08,588 --> 01:08:11,376
- Anybody else in here?
- Well, you're here.

694
01:08:11,508 --> 01:08:15,257
- I can't see. Who are you?
- Sheriff's office.

695
01:08:20,309 --> 01:08:22,634
Nobody in here.

696
01:08:33,864 --> 01:08:35,691
They're gone now.

697
01:08:43,123 --> 01:08:46,706
- What are you laughing at?
- You wouldn't believe what he said.

698
01:08:46,835 --> 01:08:51,212
- Those things are private.
- Do you really get away with that?

699
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:55,384
- Do you know what he said?
- What did he say?

700
01:08:55,510 --> 01:08:59,591
"One more kiss before we die."
Can you imagine?

701
01:08:59,723 --> 01:09:01,716
- That's stupid.
- It is not.

702
01:09:04,937 --> 01:09:07,606
- Who is it?
- Me.

703
01:09:09,691 --> 01:09:12,099
- What did you find out?
- Plenty.

704
01:09:12,235 --> 01:09:14,561
They slapped Maria around
this morning,

705
01:09:14,696 --> 01:09:17,614
put Tuscarora in jail
for stealing his own horses,

706
01:09:17,741 --> 01:09:21,691
and they've gone to Old Man
Phillips' ranch to force him to give in.

707
01:09:21,828 --> 01:09:24,782
- Are we gonna let 'em?
- Not if we can help it.

708
01:09:24,915 --> 01:09:27,287
I'm sorry I couldn't get here before.

709
01:09:27,417 --> 01:09:30,288
- There were men.
- We had visitors.

710
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:33,836
- I was asking the way to Phillips' ranch.
- I'll take you.

711
01:09:33,966 --> 01:09:36,539
- Not a chance!
- She can't stay here.

712
01:09:36,677 --> 01:09:39,084
You know that, don't you?
I'll take the wagon.

713
01:09:39,221 --> 01:09:41,972
- Why?
- It's all I've got left.

714
01:09:42,099 --> 01:09:44,471
I might not get a chance
to come back for it.

715
01:09:44,601 --> 01:09:46,641
You have a lot of faith in us!

716
01:09:46,770 --> 01:09:48,846
You're good,
but you're taking on a lot.

717
01:09:48,981 --> 01:09:53,109
- Can you get out without being seen?
- With luck. Help me, Amelita.

718
01:09:53,235 --> 01:09:56,355
I'll meet you east of town,
half a mile from the little church.

719
01:09:56,488 --> 01:10:00,652
I can show you.
Is there anything else I can do?

720
01:10:00,784 --> 01:10:04,070
Pray a little.
We'll be back if things work out right.

721
01:10:04,204 --> 01:10:06,280
It's very much for just two men.

722
01:10:06,415 --> 01:10:08,621
I hope there'll be three
when we see Mr Phillips.

723
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:12,700
- Will you show us the way?
- Yes. Follow me.

724
01:10:28,895 --> 01:10:33,392
There are two of them by the gate.
I don't see the third one...

725
01:10:33,525 --> 01:10:36,692
Wait a minute. See that shack
behind the house?

726
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:40,236
- That looks like cigarette smoke.
- You've got good eyes.

727
01:10:40,365 --> 01:10:41,859
I see 'em.

728
01:10:41,992 --> 01:10:46,535
- Think you can handle him?
- Sure. I can get in behind him.

729
01:10:46,663 --> 01:10:48,122
All right.

730
01:10:49,041 --> 01:10:50,784
How about you?

731
01:10:50,917 --> 01:10:54,286
We can leave Shasta at the wagon
and when we get through...

732
01:10:54,421 --> 01:10:57,505
How are you gonna get close enough
to them?

733
01:10:57,633 --> 01:11:01,084
This comfortable old man figured
he'd shoot 'em.

734
01:11:01,219 --> 01:11:03,212
How will you get into the house?

735
01:11:03,347 --> 01:11:06,680
Phillips will blow your head
before he knows what side you're on.

736
01:11:06,808 --> 01:11:08,848
- Did you...?
- Don't be sarcastic.

737
01:11:08,977 --> 01:11:11,515
- Do you have any suggestions?
- Yes, I do.

738
01:11:11,647 --> 01:11:14,138
I'll drive the wagon in.
You'll be in back.

739
01:11:14,274 --> 01:11:16,267
And get yourself killed?

740
01:11:16,401 --> 01:11:20,102
They killed Charlie Simms...
I want them to pay for it.

741
01:11:20,238 --> 01:11:22,908
- I'm against it.
- This is your first step, isn't it?

742
01:11:23,033 --> 01:11:25,738
If you fall down,
you won't get another chance.

743
01:11:25,869 --> 01:11:29,203
- I will not permit it.
- He's in love with me.

744
01:11:29,331 --> 01:11:32,700
- I didn't say that.
- You said you thought you were.

745
01:11:32,834 --> 01:11:36,749
Are we gonna rescue an old man
or stand here and argue?

746
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:41,838
Give me two minutes
before you start and I still don't like it.

747
01:11:41,969 --> 01:11:45,135
This thing between you two -
kinda sudden, isn't it?

748
01:11:45,263 --> 01:11:49,510
It's not me, it's him.
Are all Mexicans as sudden as he is?

749
01:11:49,643 --> 01:11:51,801
One little kiss
and the balloon goes up.

750
01:11:51,937 --> 01:11:54,772
Let's get in the wagon.

751
01:12:28,682 --> 01:12:31,303
He's had his two minutes.

752
01:12:31,435 --> 01:12:34,554
Two minutes more and we'll know
if your idea was any good.

753
01:12:34,688 --> 01:12:37,309
When the shooting starts,
don't forget to duck.

754
01:12:37,441 --> 01:12:39,398
Yes, Colonel.

755
01:12:40,027 --> 01:12:42,600
Let's go.

756
01:13:05,469 --> 01:13:07,592
Got a visitor.

757
01:13:12,184 --> 01:13:15,054
What in tarnation is that thing?

758
01:13:15,937 --> 01:13:18,096
Hold it right there, miss.

759
01:13:20,692 --> 01:13:23,563
- Where are you going?
- My horses need water.

760
01:13:23,695 --> 01:13:27,360
- I thought I could get some here.
- It ain't safe to go that way...

761
01:13:27,491 --> 01:13:30,196
Ain't that the girl
Whitey Carter went lookin' for?

762
01:13:30,327 --> 01:13:32,569
- You the girl?
- Yeah, I'm the girl.

763
01:13:32,704 --> 01:13:36,702
- You got any more snake oil?
- Yeah, there's plenty in the wagon.

764
01:13:36,833 --> 01:13:39,040
Think I'll get some.

765
01:13:39,169 --> 01:13:42,372
Where have you been?
They've been lookin' all over for you.

766
01:13:42,506 --> 01:13:45,590
I don't know...
Oh, I guess I can tell you.

767
01:13:45,717 --> 01:13:48,208
I don't like Whitey.
I didn't want him to find me.

768
01:13:48,345 --> 01:13:51,548
Everybody's got different tastes.
You can't...

769
01:13:52,557 --> 01:13:55,973
- What was that?
- Your friend getting some snake oil.

770
01:13:56,103 --> 01:14:01,310
What's a girl to do when a man
keeps following her around?

771
01:14:01,441 --> 01:14:03,979
I'm tired. I haven't slept.

772
01:14:04,111 --> 01:14:07,230
Except for the other night,
in a place where an Indian was buried.

773
01:14:07,364 --> 01:14:10,780
- It was awful!
- Where was the Indian buried?

774
01:14:10,909 --> 01:14:14,278
I can't remember.
It was just before somebody hit me.

775
01:14:14,413 --> 01:14:17,864
- They hit you?
- I didn't see him, but he hit me.

776
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,669
- Where?
- There.

777
01:14:20,794 --> 01:14:24,163
You took long enough.
I was running out of things to say.

778
01:14:24,298 --> 01:14:26,089
That I can't believe.

779
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:30,967
- Hurry up.
- Just a minute.

780
01:14:32,222 --> 01:14:35,425
What's goin' on out there?
Who's out there?

781
01:14:35,559 --> 01:14:37,717
Speak up or I'll shoot.

782
01:14:37,853 --> 01:14:40,770
Hold on a bit.
We're trying to help ya!

783
01:14:47,362 --> 01:14:50,980
- Hold your fire, you fool.
- Don't come no closer!

784
01:14:51,116 --> 01:14:55,445
- I'll go. He won't shoot a woman.
- Don't count on it.

785
01:14:58,540 --> 01:15:00,865
Mr Phillips, let me in.

786
01:15:02,085 --> 01:15:05,205
You just stay where you are
out there.

787
01:15:06,965 --> 01:15:09,172
What's goin' on?

788
01:15:18,435 --> 01:15:20,843
Look out.
Stay away from that window.

789
01:15:22,856 --> 01:15:24,932
- Where's Shasta?
- Inside.

790
01:15:26,276 --> 01:15:28,352
- Who's out there?
- It's me.

791
01:15:28,487 --> 01:15:31,357
- Who's me?
- Pierre Cordona.

792
01:15:31,490 --> 01:15:34,906
- You Tuscarora's captain?
- Used to be.

793
01:15:35,035 --> 01:15:36,778
Don't try nothing.

794
01:15:38,705 --> 01:15:43,166
You, big fella,
get down off that contraption.

795
01:15:48,173 --> 01:15:52,087
Now get your hands up high
and walk up here nice and easy.

796
01:15:53,804 --> 01:15:57,801
You too, Cordona.
And keep 'em high.

797
01:16:00,352 --> 01:16:02,760
Just keep them up there.

798
01:16:11,571 --> 01:16:15,521
Keep your hands up
and say something. Go ahead.

799
01:16:15,659 --> 01:16:18,743
- What'll I say?
- I wanna hear you talk.

800
01:16:18,870 --> 01:16:21,326
- If you quit prodding me...
- I knew it!

801
01:16:21,456 --> 01:16:24,291
I can tell by your talking,
you're a Yank.

802
01:16:25,627 --> 01:16:29,127
- Didn't you tell him?
- He's a difficult man to convince.

803
01:16:29,256 --> 01:16:32,459
You would be too, if you had a flock
of no goods hanging on you.

804
01:16:32,592 --> 01:16:37,053
You said you was my boy's captain.
How do I know that?

805
01:16:38,724 --> 01:16:41,511
Did he write to you
about the first battle we were in?

806
01:16:43,687 --> 01:16:48,728
- Was he shot in the arm?
- I guess you're who you say you are.

807
01:16:48,859 --> 01:16:51,314
What's this damn big Yank doin' here?

808
01:16:51,445 --> 01:16:54,481
This damn big Yank's
after another damn big Yank

809
01:16:54,615 --> 01:16:56,607
and helping you in the process.

810
01:16:56,867 --> 01:17:00,236
- What's your name?
- Cord McNally.

811
01:17:00,370 --> 01:17:02,659
Didn't Tuscarora tell you about me?

812
01:17:02,789 --> 01:17:06,704
He sure did.
And I ain't gonna repeat what he said.

813
01:17:06,835 --> 01:17:08,709
Tell me about her.

814
01:17:08,837 --> 01:17:12,538
I'd have shot her, but she's got
the best lookin' legs I ever seen.

815
01:17:12,674 --> 01:17:16,292
- I didn't have the view you did.
- What's she doin' here?

816
01:17:16,428 --> 01:17:19,844
Whitey Carter
murdered one of her friends.

817
01:17:19,973 --> 01:17:22,808
Old Charlie Simms.
I heard about that.

818
01:17:22,934 --> 01:17:25,307
- Now I know who she is.
- Whitey's dead.

819
01:17:25,437 --> 01:17:27,513
Best news I heard all year.

820
01:17:27,648 --> 01:17:30,435
- Who killed him?
- She did.

821
01:17:30,567 --> 01:17:34,896
Well, I'll be a sucking mule!
Legs like that and can shoot too.

822
01:17:36,031 --> 01:17:39,234
I'm obliged to you
for getting me out of the fix I was in.

823
01:17:40,535 --> 01:17:44,154
- This calls for a drink.
- I could sure use one.

824
01:17:44,289 --> 01:17:47,492
They got my boy.
What do you plan on doing?

825
01:17:47,626 --> 01:17:49,832
Ride into town and bust open the jail?

826
01:17:49,962 --> 01:17:53,081
That's not for the young.
What's it brewed with?

827
01:17:53,215 --> 01:17:55,884
Are you just gonna bust open the jail?

828
01:17:56,009 --> 01:17:59,710
The answer is no,
unless you want your boy killed.

829
01:17:59,846 --> 01:18:02,302
- Think I'm a fool?
- That's not the question.

830
01:18:02,432 --> 01:18:04,508
We need something
to bargain with.

831
01:18:04,643 --> 01:18:06,386
- Like what?
- Like Ketcham.

832
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:09,189
Ketcham?
Are you serious or crazy?

833
01:18:09,314 --> 01:18:12,600
A little of both, but it's the only way
to get your boy back.

834
01:18:12,734 --> 01:18:16,602
- How do you get Ketcham?
- You know his ranch pretty well.

835
01:18:16,738 --> 01:18:20,154
- I was there before he had it.
- How far is it?

836
01:18:20,284 --> 01:18:21,528
Two... three hours.

837
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:26,867
- You comin' with us?
- Reckon I'm crazy too.

838
01:18:26,999 --> 01:18:31,292
Is there a safe place to leave
this young lady while we're gone?

839
01:18:31,420 --> 01:18:33,911
Hank Pryor's place is on the way.

840
01:18:34,047 --> 01:18:37,665
I reckon we can get there before dark,
if we leave right away.

841
01:18:37,801 --> 01:18:40,209
- I'm going with you. I can help.
- You're not going.

842
01:18:40,345 --> 01:18:43,845
You've been trying to run this show
since we met.

843
01:18:43,974 --> 01:18:48,054
Listen to me and keep still.
You are not going!

844
01:18:48,186 --> 01:18:51,353
- You tell her, Frenchy.
- Yeah.

845
01:18:54,901 --> 01:18:58,484
I'd give every horse I own
to get a chance at that fella.

846
01:18:58,613 --> 01:19:01,235
Mr Pryor,
if we don't come back, you said...

847
01:19:01,366 --> 01:19:03,988
I'm not gonna disappoint you.

848
01:19:04,244 --> 01:19:06,652
I told you I'd get the girl to Blackthorne.

849
01:19:06,788 --> 01:19:08,496
Thank you.

850
01:19:09,666 --> 01:19:11,410
- Come on, Shasta.
- No.

851
01:19:13,629 --> 01:19:15,870
What the...? Frenchy!

852
01:19:16,006 --> 01:19:20,217
Are you comin' with us, or you got
something better to do?

853
01:19:21,595 --> 01:19:23,255
That's a silly question, Colonel.

854
01:19:23,388 --> 01:19:26,140
You'd like to be doin' that yourself,
wouldn't you?

855
01:19:27,142 --> 01:19:31,769
No, Mr Phillips, not a chance.
I'm just comfortable.

856
01:19:35,484 --> 01:19:39,232
You keep calling me Frenchy.
I'm half-Mexican, you know?

857
01:19:39,363 --> 01:19:43,941
Yeah. Which half was kneeling
and which half was kissing her hand?

858
01:20:02,469 --> 01:20:05,672
- Where's Ketcham apt to be?
- The big house.

859
01:20:05,806 --> 01:20:08,925
- What does he look like?
- Big man. Black hair. Moustache.

860
01:20:09,059 --> 01:20:10,933
Could be anybody.

861
01:20:11,061 --> 01:20:15,059
Could be the man that was with Whitey
when we paid the money.

862
01:20:16,817 --> 01:20:21,360
- How many men has he got?
- 15 or 20 hands in the bunkhouse.

863
01:20:21,488 --> 01:20:24,275
There's one over there,
another farther to the right.

864
01:20:24,408 --> 01:20:28,156
And these men guarding the place,
which you boys call sentries.

865
01:20:28,287 --> 01:20:32,865
- Ketcham doesn't take many chances.
- I can see three... no, four.

866
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,206
There's one over by the gate.

867
01:20:35,335 --> 01:20:39,380
We'll have to get them first,
get into that house,

868
01:20:39,506 --> 01:20:43,171
grab Ketcham,
and use him to hold the rest off.

869
01:20:43,302 --> 01:20:47,595
- We'd better not kill him, then?
- No, we'd better not kill him.

870
01:20:47,723 --> 01:20:51,886
- Well, Frenchy?
- I'll take the one in front of the house.

871
01:20:52,019 --> 01:20:55,185
I'll take the one on the left
and the one in front of the bunkhouse.

872
01:20:55,314 --> 01:20:57,140
Leave one for me.

873
01:20:57,274 --> 01:21:00,275
Could you sneak up
on that fella at the gate?

874
01:21:00,402 --> 01:21:03,154
I can sneak up on a coyote
if I have a mind to.

875
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:05,735
You better give me a little start.

876
01:21:05,866 --> 01:21:08,404
No sense in letting this go to waste.

877
01:21:09,911 --> 01:21:12,200
Remind me
to ask Tuscarora a question.

878
01:21:12,331 --> 01:21:13,991
About what?

879
01:21:14,124 --> 01:21:17,540
He said you were a saintly old man
who didn't hold with all the vices.

880
01:21:17,669 --> 01:21:19,543
I don't hold with them at all.

881
01:21:19,671 --> 01:21:23,835
That don't stop me from taking a saintly
pleasure when I get a chance.

882
01:21:25,010 --> 01:21:29,838
- Why don't you blow a bugle?
- Ready? If you ain't, I'll go by myself.

883
01:23:23,754 --> 01:23:25,830
- Where's the old man?
- There.

884
01:23:25,964 --> 01:23:28,538
Did you get the fella at the gate?

885
01:23:28,675 --> 01:23:30,751
He's at another gate
looking for Saint Peter.

886
01:23:42,064 --> 01:23:45,598
That big man at the desk,
he's the one I gave the money to.

887
01:23:45,734 --> 01:23:47,727
Sergeant lke Gorman.

888
01:23:58,205 --> 01:24:00,743
I've waited a long time for this.

889
01:24:04,962 --> 01:24:07,535
Sergeant Major Gorman,
how does it feel?

890
01:24:08,966 --> 01:24:14,007
Remember Lieutenant Forsythe?
Well, here's one for him.

891
01:24:23,814 --> 01:24:25,771
- Get up!
- Only for a while.

892
01:24:33,699 --> 01:24:36,783
McNally, give him one for Tuscarora.

893
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:44,247
Right, let's talk to your people.

894
01:24:44,376 --> 01:24:48,208
Tell 'em they move a finger
and I blow your head off. Yell out.

895
01:24:48,338 --> 01:24:53,296
Do you hear me? This is Ketcham.
Don't move. Don't do anything.

896
01:24:53,427 --> 01:24:55,633
- Do you hear me?
- Yeah, we hear you.

897
01:24:55,762 --> 01:24:58,799
Tell 'em to get our horses.
And one for you.

898
01:24:58,932 --> 01:25:01,470
Bring their horses
and one for me.

899
01:25:01,601 --> 01:25:03,096
All right.

900
01:25:03,228 --> 01:25:08,020
Find out where he hides them deeds
and all the stuff he's been stealin'.

901
01:25:08,150 --> 01:25:11,151
You don't think
I'd keep them here, do you?

902
01:25:11,278 --> 01:25:14,279
Where do you keep 'em?
Where are they?

903
01:25:14,406 --> 01:25:16,149
- At the bank.
- Where?

904
01:25:16,283 --> 01:25:18,774
- In the bank.
- Where?

905
01:25:19,369 --> 01:25:23,747
They're here.
Behind that cabinet. In a safe.

906
01:25:23,874 --> 01:25:25,701
Take a look.

907
01:25:33,216 --> 01:25:35,126
It's locked.

908
01:25:43,352 --> 01:25:47,895
Here they are, McNally.
All the stuff we were lookin' for.

909
01:25:48,023 --> 01:25:49,434
Look out!

910
01:25:52,653 --> 01:25:55,190
Fire! Help me, please!

911
01:25:55,572 --> 01:25:58,608
- Phillips, help me, please.
- Let him burn.

912
01:25:58,742 --> 01:26:01,778
Don't let him burn
till he signs these papers.

913
01:26:01,912 --> 01:26:05,363
- Are you ready to sign?
- I'll sign anything.

914
01:26:05,499 --> 01:26:07,159
All right, Frenchy.

915
01:26:15,133 --> 01:26:20,258
Ketcham, take a look at this.
The triggers are wired back.

916
01:26:20,389 --> 01:26:23,674
See what happens
if my thumb slips off.

917
01:26:23,809 --> 01:26:27,059
And my thumbs ain't as strong
as they used to be.

918
01:26:28,146 --> 01:26:30,554
We got your horses.
What shall we do with them?

919
01:26:30,691 --> 01:26:34,523
Bring 'em up to the house.
Come on, let's go.

920
01:26:37,030 --> 01:26:40,945
One man hold the horses.
The rest of you clear out.

921
01:26:45,789 --> 01:26:47,995
We're coming outside.

922
01:26:49,292 --> 01:26:52,412
Do what he says.
Don't try anything.

923
01:26:54,006 --> 01:26:56,627
You take the sorrel. That one's mine.

924
01:26:56,758 --> 01:26:59,795
Can you cover him while I get up?

925
01:27:05,183 --> 01:27:08,884
All that fighting in there
wore me out.

926
01:27:10,022 --> 01:27:12,560
All right, Ketcham, move out.

927
01:27:17,070 --> 01:27:19,146
Let's hold it up here.

928
01:27:19,823 --> 01:27:21,780
I can't keep riding like this.

929
01:27:21,908 --> 01:27:25,028
Would you rather walk?

930
01:27:26,038 --> 01:27:29,038
- Anybody following us?
- Didn't see anyone.

931
01:27:29,166 --> 01:27:33,578
Let's talk a bit. You want your boy
out of jail, don't you, Mr Phillips?

932
01:27:33,712 --> 01:27:35,751
Damn right I do.

933
01:27:35,881 --> 01:27:39,047
- How do we get him out?
- We use Ketcham.

934
01:27:39,176 --> 01:27:44,217
And how long do you think
before Hendricks will have us too?

935
01:27:44,348 --> 01:27:48,595
You and your military mind. You gotta
know the answer to everything.

936
01:27:48,727 --> 01:27:51,300
- What'll we do?
- All right.

937
01:27:51,438 --> 01:27:54,605
Us civilians ain't
the fools you Yanks think.

938
01:27:54,733 --> 01:27:57,769
- There's a fort at Longhorn Springs.
- That's right.

939
01:27:57,903 --> 01:28:01,817
- We'll take him there.
- What'll Hendricks be doing?

940
01:28:01,948 --> 01:28:05,033
He'd rather see Ketcham dead
than the army get him.

941
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:07,995
- You got something in mind?
- Yeah.

942
01:28:08,121 --> 01:28:13,163
We don't take Tuscarora out of jail,
we join him there and fort up. You...

943
01:28:13,293 --> 01:28:16,460
I go into Longhorn Springs
and bring in the cavalry.

944
01:28:16,588 --> 01:28:20,206
- That's smart for a captain, Frenchy.
- Thank you, sir.

945
01:28:20,342 --> 01:28:23,462
You ought to be back
by late tomorrow afternoon.

946
01:28:23,595 --> 01:28:26,086
If we run into trouble,
we can hold out till then.

947
01:28:26,223 --> 01:28:30,055
Stay on this trail till you hit
the stage road, then take the west fork.

948
01:28:30,185 --> 01:28:33,139
Good luck, Colonel. Sir.

949
01:28:33,271 --> 01:28:36,557
Don't forget my thumb is gettin' tired.

950
01:28:36,692 --> 01:28:41,484
Don't go over rocks. My horse might
stumble and we'd have an accident.

951
01:28:41,613 --> 01:28:43,985
Let's go.

952
01:28:47,536 --> 01:28:51,913
- What are you doin' here?
- We went to Phillips' ranch.

953
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:54,365
Barter's dead,
Minton had a broken shoulder,

954
01:28:54,501 --> 01:28:57,170
and Chester had been cold cocked
pretty bad.

955
01:28:57,295 --> 01:28:59,869
He said a girl drove
in that medicine show wagon.

956
01:29:00,007 --> 01:29:03,589
He was lookin' it over
and that's all he could remember.

957
01:29:03,719 --> 01:29:08,215
It coulda been three of 'em. The wagon
was gone and so was Phillips.

958
01:29:08,348 --> 01:29:13,176
- Anybody see where the wagon went?
- Couldn't find any tracks. Too dark.

959
01:29:13,312 --> 01:29:16,846
Spence, you take five men
and guard the north road.

960
01:29:16,982 --> 01:29:20,351
Morton, you take a few more.
Leave some on the south road close in.

961
01:29:20,485 --> 01:29:24,649
The rest of you go to the west fork.
Stop everybody going out and in.

962
01:29:24,781 --> 01:29:28,400
Shoot anybody that tries to get by.
Now move.

963
01:29:33,749 --> 01:29:37,533
- What are we stopping here for?
- Tuscarora's girlfriend.

964
01:29:37,669 --> 01:29:42,415
Maybe I can find out how things stand.
Can you handle Ketcham?

965
01:29:42,549 --> 01:29:46,713
If you hear a loud noise,
it'll be Mr Ketcham dying.

966
01:29:57,689 --> 01:30:00,856
You got him! I'm glad.

967
01:30:02,569 --> 01:30:05,772
In case you don't know,
that's Spanish for "pig", Ketcham.

968
01:30:05,906 --> 01:30:08,112
Much has happened tonight.

969
01:30:08,241 --> 01:30:12,654
The men came from the Phillips ranch
and told what you had done

970
01:30:12,788 --> 01:30:15,457
and the Sheriff was very angry.

971
01:30:15,582 --> 01:30:20,493
Would you like to see
what he does when he's angry?

972
01:30:23,298 --> 01:30:26,418
Amelita, show him.

973
01:30:28,053 --> 01:30:30,092
Amelita?

974
01:30:31,932 --> 01:30:33,971
Take a look.

975
01:30:34,685 --> 01:30:39,145
Go on, take a good look.
The Sheriff did it.

976
01:30:39,272 --> 01:30:43,816
- Why?
- To make me talk. To punish me.

977
01:30:43,944 --> 01:30:48,273
He did it and then he laughed.

978
01:30:49,449 --> 01:30:53,032
- Someday I'm gonna kill him.
- You'll have to beat me to it.

979
01:30:53,161 --> 01:30:55,534
I'm gonna kill him someday.

980
01:30:56,790 --> 01:31:01,915
Be careful. The Sheriff has
many men outside hunting for you.

981
01:31:02,045 --> 01:31:04,287
And others waiting for you in the jail.

982
01:31:04,423 --> 01:31:08,919
We've got the edge on him.
We got their boss.

983
01:31:12,347 --> 01:31:14,969
- I will pray for you.
- Good night.

984
01:31:17,352 --> 01:31:20,555
They don't know we got Ketcham yet,

985
01:31:20,689 --> 01:31:23,690
but they know
we've been to your place and got you,

986
01:31:23,817 --> 01:31:27,268
so they'll probably be waiting for us.

987
01:31:27,404 --> 01:31:31,733
- You still wanna try?
- With or without you, Colonel.

988
01:31:31,867 --> 01:31:34,488
That's good enough for me.

989
01:31:38,498 --> 01:31:40,372
Move.

990
01:31:48,675 --> 01:31:51,297
We're gettin' near the jail, Mr Ketcham.

991
01:31:51,428 --> 01:31:56,006
My rheumatism is bad,
so don't put a strain on my finger.

992
01:32:05,734 --> 01:32:09,399
You in the jail!

993
01:32:11,323 --> 01:32:13,992
Tell Hendricks to step out.

994
01:32:22,167 --> 01:32:25,868
Blue Tom, we've got
your friend Ketcham here.

995
01:32:26,004 --> 01:32:31,211
And there's a sawn-off shotgun with
the triggers tied back right behind him.

996
01:32:31,343 --> 01:32:33,798
He wants to tell you something.

997
01:32:33,929 --> 01:32:39,848
Sergeant Major, you louse this up
and you won't live to know it. Talk.

998
01:32:39,977 --> 01:32:43,974
Hold your fire, Tom.
Do anything he says. Don't try anything.

999
01:32:44,106 --> 01:32:46,478
- You hear him?
- I heard.

1000
01:32:46,608 --> 01:32:49,230
Get all your men out of the jail.

1001
01:32:51,446 --> 01:32:53,937
You heard him. Come on out.

1002
01:33:04,501 --> 01:33:06,743
Now, everybody drop their guns.

1003
01:33:06,878 --> 01:33:10,378
- What d'ya say, Mr Ketcham?
- Do it. For God's sake, do it.

1004
01:33:10,507 --> 01:33:13,128
All right, drop 'em.

1005
01:33:15,220 --> 01:33:19,882
Everybody ease over and keep going
till you're in front of that hotel.

1006
01:33:22,894 --> 01:33:24,721
Hendricks, you hold it.

1007
01:33:24,855 --> 01:33:28,354
There's still somebody in that jail,
Ketcham.

1008
01:33:28,483 --> 01:33:31,271
Tom, don't try it.
Get whoever's in there out.

1009
01:33:32,738 --> 01:33:34,896
All right, Barney, come on out.

1010
01:33:37,743 --> 01:33:40,862
Drop your gun
and get over with the rest of 'em.

1011
01:34:06,313 --> 01:34:08,886
You wanna step down, Mr Phillips?

1012
01:34:09,941 --> 01:34:14,271
Hope this thing don't go off
while I'm climbing down.

1013
01:34:14,738 --> 01:34:17,941
Step off, Sergeant Major.
Let's go to jail.

1014
01:34:23,288 --> 01:34:27,238
Don't worry, Mr Ketcham,
we'll get you outta there.

1015
01:34:27,376 --> 01:34:31,669
That's a good idea, Sheriff.
Why don't you try it? Please try it!

1016
01:34:31,797 --> 01:34:35,794
No, Tom, forget it. He wants you
to try something. He's crazy.

1017
01:34:35,926 --> 01:34:40,552
He's right. Got another barrel left.
Get in there.

1018
01:34:44,810 --> 01:34:47,680
We'll be here a day, maybe two.

1019
01:34:48,772 --> 01:34:51,263
Then the US Cavalry will be here.

1020
01:34:52,150 --> 01:34:56,647
- I should have taken you this morning.
- You should have tried.

1021
01:35:16,258 --> 01:35:19,294
I couldn't say hello this morning,
but I'm glad to see you.

1022
01:35:19,428 --> 01:35:22,298
- How do you feel?
- Fine. Except for some sore ribs.

1023
01:35:22,431 --> 01:35:26,594
I'll stay back here with Ketcham
in case his friends try something.

1024
01:35:27,352 --> 01:35:31,848
Don't you worry none, Ketcham.
You're gonna be the first to die.

1025
01:35:33,025 --> 01:35:37,188
- Where's Captain Cordona?
- He's gone for help.

1026
01:35:37,321 --> 01:35:39,942
How long are we gonna be here?

1027
01:35:40,073 --> 01:35:42,695
Till he comes back with the cavalry.

1028
01:35:44,161 --> 01:35:46,449
Douse that light.

1029
01:35:58,300 --> 01:36:01,503
Mr Phillips,
is that the only tune you know?

1030
01:36:01,636 --> 01:36:05,420
I don't know this one,
that's why I keep practising it.

1031
01:36:11,063 --> 01:36:14,182
Colonel, you have any trouble
gettin' back into town?

1032
01:36:14,316 --> 01:36:17,649
They had men out,
but we had Ketcham.

1033
01:36:17,778 --> 01:36:20,732
You suppose they have men
watching the roads too?

1034
01:36:20,864 --> 01:36:22,821
Hendricks is not stupid.

1035
01:36:22,949 --> 01:36:26,401
What if they catch the Captain
before he gets help?

1036
01:36:26,536 --> 01:36:31,494
Then we're in more trouble
than we've been in since the start.

1037
01:36:34,878 --> 01:36:38,212
Mr Phillips, is there any way
of getting you to stop that?

1038
01:36:40,092 --> 01:36:42,084
Yeah, I'd stop for a drink.

1039
01:36:42,219 --> 01:36:45,385
Well, if there's one, I'll get it for you.

1040
01:36:59,361 --> 01:37:01,769
Where are you going?

1041
01:37:24,219 --> 01:37:25,417
In the jail.

1042
01:37:26,221 --> 01:37:30,598
This is Doc Jones, the dentist.
Can I come in?

1043
01:37:30,726 --> 01:37:32,469
Let him in.

1044
01:37:37,899 --> 01:37:39,892
You're taking a chance coming here.

1045
01:37:40,027 --> 01:37:42,518
I don't think so.
They're not watching the place.

1046
01:37:42,654 --> 01:37:44,528
Don't bet on it.

1047
01:37:44,656 --> 01:37:46,530
I brought some food and beer.

1048
01:37:46,658 --> 01:37:50,110
- Better see Ketcham gets a bite.
- He don't get no beer, does he?

1049
01:37:50,245 --> 01:37:53,828
Neither do you, unless you promise
not to play that harp.

1050
01:37:53,957 --> 01:37:55,451
I'll stop.

1051
01:38:10,390 --> 01:38:12,715
- Who's there?
- Shasta.

1052
01:38:20,067 --> 01:38:24,444
- What are you doing here?
- I couldn't stand waiting, not knowing.

1053
01:38:24,571 --> 01:38:27,738
I took one of Mr Pryor's horses.
Nobody saw me.

1054
01:38:28,450 --> 01:38:29,944
Hey, you in the jail.

1055
01:38:39,670 --> 01:38:42,421
- What d'ya want?
- I got a message.

1056
01:38:42,547 --> 01:38:45,169
I don't wanna
get shot delivering it.

1057
01:38:45,300 --> 01:38:46,878
Here it is.

1058
01:38:49,971 --> 01:38:52,260
See what it is.

1059
01:39:13,370 --> 01:39:15,825
- They got Frenchy.
- Is he all right?

1060
01:39:15,956 --> 01:39:18,363
Evidently.
They wanna trade him for Ketcham.

1061
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:22,035
- So there'll be no soldiers.
- Where do they want the trade off?

1062
01:39:22,170 --> 01:39:25,954
There's a barn by a creek
at the other end of town.

1063
01:39:26,091 --> 01:39:28,167
I know where that is.

1064
01:39:28,301 --> 01:39:31,967
They'll be at the barn
with Frenchy an hour after sun up.

1065
01:39:32,556 --> 01:39:35,676
- We're to bring Ketcham.
- Is that all it says?

1066
01:39:35,809 --> 01:39:39,759
- That's all.
- What will they do after the trade?

1067
01:39:39,896 --> 01:39:43,728
There's more of them than us.
What do you think they'll do?

1068
01:39:43,859 --> 01:39:48,686
- What's it gonna be, Colonel?
- Looks like we have no choice.

1069
01:39:48,822 --> 01:39:51,989
You that delivered the message,
you out there?

1070
01:39:52,117 --> 01:39:53,492
I'm here.

1071
01:39:53,618 --> 01:39:56,370
Tell Hendricks we'll be there
after sun up.

1072
01:39:56,496 --> 01:40:00,245
And if we see anybody
on the way over there,

1073
01:40:00,375 --> 01:40:02,249
he's gonna lose his boss.

1074
01:40:02,377 --> 01:40:04,286
I'll tell him.

1075
01:40:10,719 --> 01:40:12,546
Anybody got the time?

1076
01:40:15,098 --> 01:40:17,305
Two hours to sun up.

1077
01:40:18,602 --> 01:40:20,511
Anything I can do?

1078
01:40:20,771 --> 01:40:24,222
He ought to take
all that stuff Ketcham signed,

1079
01:40:24,358 --> 01:40:27,109
and get them back to the owners.

1080
01:40:29,404 --> 01:40:32,856
They won't know Ketcham signed these
till after the trade.

1081
01:40:32,991 --> 01:40:34,450
Thanks.

1082
01:40:35,577 --> 01:40:37,700
Thanks, all of you.

1083
01:40:39,623 --> 01:40:41,912
I wish you luck.

1084
01:40:42,042 --> 01:40:44,414
Luck, he says!

1085
01:40:44,544 --> 01:40:48,672
We need more than luck.
We need a miracle.

1086
01:40:48,799 --> 01:40:52,796
How about it, Sergeant?
You think you can pass one?

1087
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:10,351
Colonel, it don't seem
like you want to say it, so shall I say it?

1088
01:41:11,238 --> 01:41:12,898
It's time.

1089
01:41:15,617 --> 01:41:18,191
All right, bring him up.

1090
01:41:18,328 --> 01:41:22,575
Shasta, you'd better wait
four or five minutes after we're gone,

1091
01:41:22,708 --> 01:41:24,914
then beat it over to your friends.

1092
01:41:25,043 --> 01:41:27,285
If we lose, get out of town quick.

1093
01:41:27,421 --> 01:41:28,796
Colonel...

1094
01:41:28,922 --> 01:41:33,086
- I just wanted to tell you...
- I'll be seeing you.

1095
01:41:34,678 --> 01:41:38,296
You'd better wipe that smile
off your face,

1096
01:41:38,432 --> 01:41:40,638
or I'll do it for you.

1097
01:41:57,117 --> 01:41:59,240
Hold it a minute.

1098
01:42:15,761 --> 01:42:19,295
Stay at this end of town
and you won't get hurt.

1099
01:43:22,119 --> 01:43:23,399
Look out.

1100
01:43:23,537 --> 01:43:27,784
It's all right, Colonel McNally,
they're friends.

1101
01:43:29,835 --> 01:43:33,832
- What are you doing here?
- They came to help.

1102
01:43:34,131 --> 01:43:39,125
They won't be much help
unless they're real good.

1103
01:43:39,261 --> 01:43:41,716
- Doc gave you the deeds, didn't he?
- Sure.

1104
01:43:41,847 --> 01:43:44,172
But what are they worth
if you lose?

1105
01:43:44,307 --> 01:43:49,302
- You know what you're getting into?
- We promised you in the trade,

1106
01:43:49,438 --> 01:43:53,270
but we didn't say
what condition you'd be in.

1107
01:43:54,693 --> 01:43:58,441
- Can any of you shoot?
- Bide's a good shot.

1108
01:43:58,613 --> 01:44:02,825
Remember him? His bandage on the
Captain's leg got you that headache.

1109
01:44:02,951 --> 01:44:05,703
- Remember, Colonel?
- I remember.

1110
01:44:05,829 --> 01:44:10,408
- We all fought in the war, Colonel.
- All right, you're in.

1111
01:44:10,917 --> 01:44:13,918
Somebody watch that back door.

1112
01:44:34,316 --> 01:44:38,527
You got more help than you think.
There's men behind that wall.

1113
01:44:38,654 --> 01:44:41,191
Could surprise those fellas
and out-flank them.

1114
01:44:41,323 --> 01:44:45,700
- Bide, how deep is that creek?
- It changes. Three, four... six feet.

1115
01:44:45,827 --> 01:44:49,327
- Deep near the bridge?
- Ought to be.

1116
01:44:49,456 --> 01:44:53,288
I got an idea. Can you hold up
this trade to give me time?

1117
01:44:53,418 --> 01:44:56,123
- Not for long...
- Bide, give me your gun.

1118
01:44:56,254 --> 01:44:59,588
- What do you plan to do?
- Ain't got time to explain, Colonel.

1119
01:45:31,957 --> 01:45:34,530
I can't hold up any longer.

1120
01:45:34,835 --> 01:45:38,879
Hendricks. Hendricks!

1121
01:45:41,675 --> 01:45:43,798
What do you want?

1122
01:45:44,261 --> 01:45:47,760
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

1123
01:45:47,889 --> 01:45:50,297
You start Ketcham, we'll send Cordona.

1124
01:45:50,434 --> 01:45:52,806
I'd like to take a look at Cordona.

1125
01:45:53,437 --> 01:45:55,595
Bring him out.

1126
01:45:59,109 --> 01:46:03,237
- Satisfied?
- Whenever you're ready.

1127
01:46:23,925 --> 01:46:26,713
Hey, Colonel,
he's got where he wants to be.

1128
01:46:29,139 --> 01:46:31,547
All right, Ketcham.

1129
01:46:33,060 --> 01:46:36,263
Now, you're gonna walk across there
slow and easy.

1130
01:46:36,396 --> 01:46:40,180
- Unloosen your belt.
- What for?

1131
01:46:40,317 --> 01:46:44,315
To keep your hands busy.
Now walk.

1132
01:46:46,615 --> 01:46:49,022
That's far enough.

1133
01:46:51,411 --> 01:46:53,700
Here's your man.

1134
01:46:54,289 --> 01:46:56,412
Move.

1135
01:47:01,546 --> 01:47:04,334
All right. Take it nice and easy.

1136
01:47:27,322 --> 01:47:28,900
Hold it right where you are.

1137
01:47:29,032 --> 01:47:32,532
There's about six guns on you,
don't move.

1138
01:47:37,165 --> 01:47:40,866
- Well, Sheriff, what'll it be?
- I want Ketcham.

1139
01:47:41,378 --> 01:47:45,292
I want him too. He's no use to you.

1140
01:47:45,424 --> 01:47:48,757
He's signed all those deeds
back to their rightful owners.

1141
01:47:49,511 --> 01:47:54,173
- You're broke, both of you.
- Is that right, Ketcham?

1142
01:47:54,307 --> 01:47:55,850
No. Wait a minute, Tom.

1143
01:47:56,309 --> 01:47:58,219
He's lying. Don't shoot!

1144
01:48:01,523 --> 01:48:03,017
You yellow...

1145
01:48:16,204 --> 01:48:18,742
Get back in here, you fool.

1146
01:48:21,001 --> 01:48:23,040
Take it easy.

1147
01:48:23,170 --> 01:48:25,791
Stop your squawking. You ain't hurt.

1148
01:48:27,758 --> 01:48:29,750
Scattergun's useless.

1149
01:48:29,885 --> 01:48:33,835
Don't mind if I shoot, do you?
Makes me feel better.

1150
01:49:08,924 --> 01:49:13,420
There's a lot more than three out there.
They're gonna be tough to run out.

1151
01:49:14,554 --> 01:49:18,220
- Pete, you got the dynamite?
- I can get it.

1152
01:49:18,350 --> 01:49:21,635
- Can you use it on the cantina?
- Throw it through the window.

1153
01:49:21,770 --> 01:49:25,020
- Take Greg to back you up.
- Come on, Greg.

1154
01:49:32,155 --> 01:49:36,105
See those fellas?
They're trying to get around us.

1155
01:49:49,131 --> 01:49:51,704
- Colonel...
- I saw him.

1156
01:49:57,639 --> 01:49:59,548
Get a match.

1157
01:50:12,070 --> 01:50:13,315
Look out!

1158
01:50:20,120 --> 01:50:23,571
We'd have had that
dynamite in our laps.

1159
01:50:23,707 --> 01:50:25,996
Sure lucky I brought you along.

1160
01:50:28,253 --> 01:50:30,874
That ought to set 'em back.

1161
01:50:44,436 --> 01:50:46,512
Look behind you.
Let's get outta here.

1162
01:50:49,691 --> 01:50:52,313
- Where are you going?
- We're licked, Sheriff.

1163
01:50:52,444 --> 01:50:56,489
Come back here, you lousy...
Come on back here.

1164
01:51:21,139 --> 01:51:24,259
- Where're you going?
- After Hendricks.

1165
01:51:30,899 --> 01:51:35,478
- They're running, Colonel.
- Well, Hendricks can't run far.

1166
01:51:37,698 --> 01:51:39,607
Look out!

1167
01:51:43,995 --> 01:51:46,154
Glad you brung me?

1168
01:51:46,289 --> 01:51:49,409
Spread out. This thing isn't over yet.

1169
01:51:57,050 --> 01:52:00,336
Turn around, Sheriff.
I want you to see who's gonna kill you.

1170
01:52:29,333 --> 01:52:31,705
You got your town back.

1171
01:52:51,813 --> 01:52:54,269
I... I told you I'd kill him.

1172
01:52:54,858 --> 01:52:58,986
- I told you, didn't I?
- You told me.

1173
01:52:59,112 --> 01:53:03,905
I had a right to.
I'm gonna always wear this mark.

1174
01:53:04,993 --> 01:53:10,200
And every time I look at it,
I wanna know I had the right to kill him.

1175
01:53:10,332 --> 01:53:13,499
If you hadn't done it,
somebody else would have.

1176
01:53:14,336 --> 01:53:16,909
Now, you wanna give me a lift?

1177
01:53:17,047 --> 01:53:21,341
Mr McNally,
you make a person feel...

1178
01:53:21,468 --> 01:53:24,173
Please, don't say comfortable.
