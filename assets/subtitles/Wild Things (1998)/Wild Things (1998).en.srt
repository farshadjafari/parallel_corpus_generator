1
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:55,569
Forget it, loser.

2
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,127
Forget it, loser.

3
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:59,295
Oh, Mr. Lombardo.

4
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,161
- Hey.
- Hey, bro.

5
00:04:01,342 --> 00:04:03,674
Mr. Lombardo, what's up?

6
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:06,609
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

7
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,577
Jennifer...

8
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,220
Did you see his eyes?

9
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,445
What are you looking at, dork?

10
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:45,251
Fuck off.

11
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:48,016
I appreciate you guys coming down.

12
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,320
The only thing I'm gonna miss
in this dump is...

13
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:55,292
Settle down.

14
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,891
Settle down.

15
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:03,496
Well, we've come to the halfway point
of our senior seminars.

16
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:08,505
Settle down.
Settle down.

17
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:11,941
- Beats study hall, doesn't it?
- No!

18
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:17,046
- That you, Jimmy?
- At least in study hall I can meditate.

19
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:19,378
What he means is, "masturbate."

20
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:24,218
Something with which I'm sure you've
had hands-on experience, Kirk.

21
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,544
It wasn't me, man.
It wasn't me.

22
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:54,819
I'm innocent.
I'm innocent.

23
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:59,925
We've all heard the terms
"date rape," "sexual harassment."

24
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:04,687
We've discussed some of these issues
right here in this very room.

25
00:06:05,466 --> 00:06:09,232
Our guests today come from
the Blue Bay Police Department.

26
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,367
Detectives Duquette and Perez...

27
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,405
...are here to give us
what we hope...

28
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:17,976
...will be a fresh perspective
on the subject...

29
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:21,603
...and to address any questions
that any of you might have.

30
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:24,307
Now, let's give them
a warm welcome.

31
00:06:27,755 --> 00:06:29,313
- Thank you.
- I'm out of here.

32
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:33,153
- Why don't we begin with a question.
- This prick can kiss my ass.

33
00:06:42,136 --> 00:06:43,967
As I was saying...

34
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:46,732
...why don't we begin
with a question.

35
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:50,934
- What is a sex crime?
- Not getting any.

36
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:01,752
What's with that?
She's the one who walked out.

37
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:05,680
- Suzie Toller.
- I busted her last year for possession.

38
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:07,827
Poor kid did six months
in Camp Nine.

39
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:11,055
- Six months? First offense?
- I didn't hand down the sentence.

40
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:12,926
She was dirty.
I busted her.

41
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,328
Hey, Carol.

42
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:16,799
I appreciate you guys
taking the time to come.

43
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,198
Our pleasure.

44
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:26,807
Why do I get the feeling you don't
like the guidance counselor?

45
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,416
Don't tell me you can't see through
his routine. He's a total hound.

46
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:32,677
You mean pussy hound?

47
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:38,055
Actually, I thought
he was kind of cute.

48
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:39,782
I'd do him.

49
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:11,485
Steady.

50
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,460
Steady the bow, Jimmy.

51
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:21,829
That's good.

52
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,307
Drop the main.

53
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:35,745
All right, guys, let's de-rig
and I'll see you all Monday.

54
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:46,025
Hey, ladies, my car needs a wash.

55
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,793
Do you do windows?

56
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:50,759
Good work, guys.
A.C., see you Monday.

57
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:53,195
- See you, Mr. Lombardo.
- All right, buddy.

58
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,944
All right.

59
00:09:06,113 --> 00:09:08,206
I could definitely party
on one of those.

60
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:13,151
It's a stinkpot, Jimmy.

61
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,381
You wanna be a real boatman,
you wanna get yourself one of those.

62
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:21,054
Yeah.

63
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,128
That's a real boat.

64
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:27,093
Thank you for getting me
into this class.

65
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:29,895
No way my old man was gonna
spring for the fees.

66
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:34,097
Hey, you're working for it, and you're
learning your way around a boat.

67
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:36,572
I put myself through college
working on boats.

68
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,836
- Beats flipping burgers.
- Yeah.

69
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:43,947
Can I play too, or is it just for boys?

70
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,689
So who's washing your Jeep
this weekend, Mr. Lombardo?

71
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:53,959
The senior car wash, remember?

72
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:56,819
Washing that old Jeep of mine
is a waste of time.

73
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:59,431
Not at all.
How about if Nicole and I do it?

74
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,397
We're working as a team.

75
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:04,969
I tell you what. I'm going out
to the glades Saturday.

76
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:08,107
Why don't you come over Sunday
and wash all the mud off.

77
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:09,867
Deal.

78
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,809
I was counting on my mom
to give me a ride, but she's not here.

79
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:15,448
Surprise, surprise.

80
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:18,380
So I was wondering
if you could give me one.

81
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,451
Mr. Lombardo, you really wouldn't
want me to walk, would you?

82
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:26,024
I mean, like,
something bad might happen.

83
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:32,196
- What about you, you need a lift?
- Yeah, but I got my bike.

84
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:34,334
Hey, no problem.

85
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,779
Okay, try it.

86
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:56,078
Suzie, you need a lift?
We got room for one more.

87
00:10:56,256 --> 00:11:00,249
Jesus. Where'd she get those shoes,
"Whores 4 Less"?

88
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,961
Try it again.

89
00:11:10,604 --> 00:11:13,266
Nice to see you kids getting along.

90
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:58,646
- Don't forget Sunday.
- I won't.

91
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:04,818
- Is that Sam Lombardo?
- Hi, Mom.

92
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,956
Sam, hi.

93
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,555
Hi, Sandra.

94
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:15,066
Why don't you come on in
and have a drink.

95
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,725
Sorry, Sandra, I gotta run.

96
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,913
- Hi, Mr. Lombardo.
- Hi, Mr. Lombardo.

97
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:38,050
Hi, girls.

98
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:40,418
Look. He forgot.

99
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:42,748
- I knew it.
- No, I didn't.

100
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:45,915
Check out my Jeep.
Nice and dirty for you.

101
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:49,059
But you might wanna wait
till the other car leaves.

102
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:52,392
You mean the Mercedes
isn't yours too?

103
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:56,866
My Benz is blue.
You know that, Nicole.

104
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:58,629
Sam, I'm leaving.

105
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:01,365
So where's your hose,
Mr. Lombardo?

106
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:06,435
The hose, Kelly,
is right in front of the Jeep.

107
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:14,116
Kelly Van Ryan's
gonna wash your Jeep?

108
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,012
Come on, Barbara.
It's for a good cause.

109
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,891
Sam the philanthropist.

110
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:25,759
Yeah, well, you know what they say:
A little hard work never hurt anyone.

111
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:27,661
Okay.

112
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,236
- Have fun at the club.
- Okay.

113
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:34,423
Wow.

114
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,502
Looks brand-new.

115
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,365
Aren't you forgetting something?

116
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:45,973
Your coupon.
We gotta have it.

117
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:47,943
Oh, yeah, that thing.

118
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:52,149
- Can't we just...?
- Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.

119
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:54,613
Okay, let me look for it.

120
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:58,053
Mr. Lombardo,
we're running kind of late.

121
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:00,486
How about if Nicole goes on
to the Mansons'?

122
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,560
You can give me a ride
when you find it.

123
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:07,061
No, no, just give me a minute. Okay?

124
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:15,866
- Go.
- Are you sure?

125
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:31,575
Oh, Frankie.
Oh, God.

126
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:35,983
Oh, God!
Oh, God!

127
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:39,424
Goddamn it!

128
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,024
- Hello, this is Blue Bay High School.
- Hello.

129
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:45,528
Your son or daughter
was absent today, Monday...

130
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:47,791
Jesus H. Christ!

131
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:51,737
- What?
- Oh, nothing.

132
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,133
Come on.

133
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:59,434
- Art, this is a hell of a fish you caught.
- It's a barracuda.

134
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:02,212
If you weren't so busy
chasing booty...

135
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:05,476
...you'd have come with me
and caught one for yourself.

136
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:08,052
Don't tell me you're gonna
eat this thing.

137
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:09,483
Why not?

138
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:12,250
It's a barracuda. It's poisonous.
It'll kill you.

139
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:15,952
Shit, man, I could say that
about most of the girls you date.

140
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:18,256
Sandra Van Ryan for Sam.

141
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,934
- Sandra, what's up?
- Kelly skipped school today, Sam.

142
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,634
Have you heard anything?

143
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:33,306
Not a word.

144
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:36,506
Never mind.

145
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:39,113
I found her.

146
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,684
Pull!

147
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:47,992
Listen, Sam, it was really good
seeing you the other day.

148
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:50,529
Sandra, I'm real busy right now, so...

149
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:55,632
I haven't found anyone who can
handle my boat the way you can.

150
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:00,534
- Yeah, well...
- I know you're fucking Barbara Baxter.

151
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:05,436
- So what?
- So maybe I'm a one-woman man now.

152
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:09,141
Aw, poor Sam.

153
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:12,648
Really think you'll get one of these
Blue Bay women to marry you?

154
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:16,114
- Are you finished, Sandra?
- Grab a clue, honey.

155
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:19,452
You're a hired hand, a good lay.
That's as far as it goes.

156
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:21,890
Enjoy it, while it lasts.

157
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:23,995
Goodbye, Sandra.

158
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:27,365
Pull!

159
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:33,000
You seem to find guns therapeutic.

160
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:36,265
Maybe I ought to try it.

161
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:39,877
So let me guess.

162
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:42,879
Some boy didn't call and screwed up
your whole weekend.

163
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:46,246
So you're taking the day off. Right?

164
00:19:49,756 --> 00:19:52,054
Which one of your deck hands
is that?

165
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:54,489
Whichever one I want.

166
00:19:57,163 --> 00:20:00,655
Okay, Kelly, what's the matter?

167
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:05,627
What is it?

168
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,131
I miss Dad.

169
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:11,706
Jesus.

170
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,945
I miss him too, sometimes.

171
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:18,411
No, you don't.

172
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:21,281
He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly.

173
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,524
Oh, Kelly...

174
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,699
I don't know why he did it.

175
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:40,764
I really don't.

176
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:47,505
Can l...?

177
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:52,949
Can I get you anything?

178
00:20:53,686 --> 00:20:55,244
Do you want a Valium?

179
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:01,724
I was raped.

180
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:07,363
- What, honey? I can't hear you.
- I said, I was raped.

181
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:09,228
What?

182
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:14,533
I was raped...

183
00:21:15,842 --> 00:21:18,367
...by Sam Lombardo.

184
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,280
Sam Lombardo?

185
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:27,317
My daughter does not
get raped in Blue Bay!

186
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,145
And you're saying that
Sam Lombardo raped her?

187
00:21:30,323 --> 00:21:34,157
That son of a bitch must be insane
to think he can do this to me.

188
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:37,729
We understand your feelings,
Miss Van Ryan...

189
00:21:37,897 --> 00:21:40,957
...but please,
we need some time with Kelly.

190
00:21:41,234 --> 00:21:43,293
We'd like to take her statement alone.

191
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:49,964
- Are you all right with this, baby?
- Yeah.

192
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:51,633
Okay.

193
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:04,414
Would you like to take a break
for a minute?

194
00:22:05,725 --> 00:22:07,249
I just wanna get it over with.

195
00:22:09,128 --> 00:22:11,153
We'd like to videotape this statement.

196
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:14,767
I know this isn't pleasant, Kelly,
but these are serious charges...

197
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:19,462
...and we need to know everything that
happened between the two of you.

198
00:22:19,806 --> 00:22:21,433
Are you ready?

199
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:34,176
He started rubbing my shoulders.

200
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:38,322
I let him.

201
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:41,016
I mean, he's a nice guy.

202
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,393
The next thing...

203
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:48,497
...his hand was in my shorts.

204
00:22:49,836 --> 00:22:51,770
You know, from behind.

205
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,909
His fingers...

206
00:22:58,778 --> 00:23:02,043
- His fingers...
- Take your time.

207
00:23:05,785 --> 00:23:07,719
They were in me.

208
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:09,784
Both places, you know?

209
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:14,419
Did he put himself inside you?

210
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,153
Yes.

211
00:23:17,864 --> 00:23:19,991
I said "Stop."
I screamed.

212
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:23,192
I mean, that's how it
sounded in my head.

213
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,599
He hurt me.

214
00:23:27,273 --> 00:23:29,264
Did you try to fight him?

215
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:34,777
Well, he had my wrists
pinned behind me.

216
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:36,346
Then what?

217
00:23:36,516 --> 00:23:39,747
He kept saying, "Let it happen.

218
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:42,019
Let it happen."

219
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:46,020
And then he just stopped.

220
00:23:46,325 --> 00:23:48,384
You mean he withdrew?

221
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:51,928
I don't know. It's really hard
to remember, exactly.

222
00:23:52,665 --> 00:23:54,292
Try, Kelly.

223
00:23:59,672 --> 00:24:01,697
I know one thing he said.

224
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:06,870
He said, "Don't worry.
I didn't come."

225
00:24:07,313 --> 00:24:09,338
I can't forget that.

226
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:14,914
He said, "No little girl
can ever make me come."

227
00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:22,218
"No little girl can ever
make me come." Jesus.

228
00:24:22,395 --> 00:24:25,455
Too bad. We might have had
some physical evidence.

229
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:28,961
What?

230
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:32,969
Maybe there's no physical evidence
because nothing happened.

231
00:24:34,607 --> 00:24:37,735
You want my gut? There it is.
I think she's acting.

232
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:41,243
I think she set it up to be alone
with him so he'd come on to her.

233
00:24:41,414 --> 00:24:43,075
She's upset because he didn't.

234
00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:45,945
Maybe she set it up that way.
Maybe not.

235
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:48,985
The guy never should've had her
there in the first place.

236
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:52,215
The line I have on him,
he's done half the women in Blue Bay.

237
00:24:52,391 --> 00:24:54,621
That doesn't make him a rapist.

238
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:57,087
What about asking her
to take a polygraph?

239
00:24:57,263 --> 00:24:59,595
What about asking the pope
to take a piss test?

240
00:24:59,765 --> 00:25:01,198
This is Blue Bay, Gloria.

241
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:06,066
Ask a Van Ryan to take a lie detector
test and Tom Baxter will cut you down.

242
00:25:06,239 --> 00:25:09,436
You afraid of Tom Baxter now?
You afraid of Sandra Van Ryan?

243
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:12,703
End of discussion.
You both know what to do.

244
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:16,042
Start with his neighbors, coworkers.
Talk to Kelly's friends.

245
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:18,979
- You know what that'll mean for him.
- Yeah.

246
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:24,350
And you heard Kelly's statement.
The guy's dirty. Bring me a case.

247
00:26:16,976 --> 00:26:18,307
All right.

248
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:20,342
Good work, Jimbo.
I'll see you Monday.

249
00:26:20,513 --> 00:26:21,844
All right.

250
00:26:28,721 --> 00:26:31,349
That's what's left of my sailing class.

251
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,691
Talk to me, Artie.

252
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:41,027
Kelly Van Ryan
is accusing you of rape.

253
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,830
Jimmy told me.

254
00:26:44,337 --> 00:26:46,635
Apparently, I'm the last one
to know about it.

255
00:26:46,806 --> 00:26:48,774
Sam, I...

256
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:52,075
Sandra Van Ryan has been
on the horn all day...

257
00:26:52,244 --> 00:26:54,337
...with every member
of the school board.

258
00:26:54,513 --> 00:26:55,980
She's pushing for suspension.

259
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:59,982
And the board's just gonna roll over
for her without hearing my side?

260
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:03,952
This is insane.
I'm innocent, goddamn it.

261
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:05,590
You gotta believe that.

262
00:27:05,758 --> 00:27:07,988
All I can tell you, Sam,
is hang in there.

263
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,151
They clear you, you get reinstated...

264
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:12,991
You never get clear
of something like this.

265
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:16,124
It stays with you.

266
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:19,738
It follows you around forever.

267
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,703
You're gonna need some help, Sam.

268
00:27:23,709 --> 00:27:25,836
You're gonna need an attorney.

269
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:29,379
Right. And maybe you can tell me
which attorney in South Florida...

270
00:27:29,548 --> 00:27:32,540
...is gonna wanna go up against
the Van Ryans in court.

271
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:53,029
I'm here to see Ken Bowden.

272
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:57,266
- Do you have an appointment?
- Oh, yeah. Sam Lombardo.

273
00:27:57,443 --> 00:27:59,536
Okay, then.

274
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:02,270
Mr. Bowden,
your 10:30's here.

275
00:28:02,448 --> 00:28:04,416
Will you show him in, please?

276
00:28:07,386 --> 00:28:09,286
What brings you
to this part of town?

277
00:28:10,256 --> 00:28:12,383
Well, I was, until yesterday...

278
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:15,550
...a guidance counselor
at Blue Bay High School.

279
00:28:17,463 --> 00:28:19,488
A student there
is accusing me of rape.

280
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,531
Male or female?

281
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:26,733
- The student is Kelly Van Ryan.
- As in Sandra Van Ryan?

282
00:28:26,906 --> 00:28:29,374
As in, I'm fucked.

283
00:28:32,011 --> 00:28:33,569
Why don't you tell me about it?

284
00:28:35,681 --> 00:28:37,808
- Shit, where do I begin?
- Start with...

285
00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:41,981
...your relationship with the girl, Kelly.

286
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:47,458
She's a student. I was her counselor.
Beyond that, there's no relationship.

287
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:50,085
You got nothing to worry about.

288
00:28:53,933 --> 00:28:56,401
- What did you do to your neck?
- This?

289
00:28:57,036 --> 00:28:59,197
I don't have to wear it all the time.

290
00:29:03,142 --> 00:29:05,906
There was an insurance guy
around here earlier.

291
00:29:08,114 --> 00:29:11,083
All right, let me tell you
how I charge.

292
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:21,226
Georgie, hey.
We gonna catch some wind?

293
00:29:21,393 --> 00:29:24,055
Mr. Lombardo, I'm afraid
I can't park your car today.

294
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:27,791
You can't park me?
I'm meeting Barbara for lunch.

295
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:36,265
Can you get this parked, Georgie?
We're running late.

296
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:38,433
Right away, Mr. Baxter.

297
00:29:39,612 --> 00:29:43,378
You're finished here, Lombardo.
Take a hike.

298
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:51,419
Barbara, let's go.

299
00:29:55,528 --> 00:29:58,122
Maybe you didn't hear me, Lombardo.

300
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:00,822
You're finished in Blue Bay.

301
00:30:02,034 --> 00:30:06,630
I find you around my daughter again,
you'll be finished, period.

302
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:11,205
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Mr. Lombardo, please.

303
00:30:16,448 --> 00:30:18,279
That's all right, George.

304
00:30:41,707 --> 00:30:45,234
Sam, honey.
Haven't seen you in a while.

305
00:30:45,411 --> 00:30:48,642
- Welcome back.
- Rum and Coke.

306
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:21,165
Hey! Are you all right?

307
00:32:21,674 --> 00:32:23,733
- I'm fine.
- Cool?

308
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:26,070
That's too bad, motherfucker.

309
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,289
Sam?

310
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:48,330
Lombardo?

311
00:33:09,355 --> 00:33:12,256
Whoa, man! It's me.

312
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:16,958
Sorry, man. Things have been
getting a little weird around here.

313
00:33:17,129 --> 00:33:19,029
I can see that.

314
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:22,466
Come on in.

315
00:33:25,471 --> 00:33:29,669
You're sure this Frankie Condo guy
is the guy that did this to you?

316
00:33:30,576 --> 00:33:31,941
It was him, all right.

317
00:33:32,111 --> 00:33:34,671
He was driving
Sandra's Range Rover.

318
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:38,305
You tell that to the cops, we can
go after Sandra Van Ryan right now.

319
00:33:38,484 --> 00:33:41,715
- Forget it.
- The lady has deep pockets.

320
00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:44,617
Believe me, I know how deep
her pockets are.

321
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:49,227
I thought I might be able to save
my house. Some sort of equity loan.

322
00:33:49,595 --> 00:33:53,122
Guess who's on the
board of directors at the bank?

323
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:56,467
I don't need any more trouble
from this woman.

324
00:33:56,635 --> 00:33:59,763
You think making some sort
of statement's gonna stop her?

325
00:34:00,105 --> 00:34:03,074
With the shit I got on Kelly?
Yeah.

326
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:05,699
A year ago...

327
00:34:05,878 --> 00:34:08,540
...when her old man
blew his brains out...

328
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:10,944
...Kelly lost it, ran away.

329
00:34:11,116 --> 00:34:15,314
They found her in a fleabag motel
some place, coked out of her gourd.

330
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:18,051
Meanwhile...

331
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:21,624
...you, Sam, are voted
Educator of the Year...

332
00:34:21,794 --> 00:34:23,056
...or some crap.

333
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:25,897
They put the two of you
in front of a jury...

334
00:34:26,265 --> 00:34:29,234
...they're gonna look stupid.
They know it.

335
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:32,165
Why do you think they haven't
taken your statement yet?

336
00:34:32,938 --> 00:34:34,963
Because they're busy
looking for dirt.

337
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,903
And they're not gonna find it.

338
00:34:40,312 --> 00:34:42,177
Right?

339
00:34:43,482 --> 00:34:46,645
Ken, I don't fuck my students.

340
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:24,979
He's just showing off
for you now.

341
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:29,286
Hey there, Ruby.

342
00:35:29,528 --> 00:35:31,758
I see you still got Walter.

343
00:35:32,331 --> 00:35:34,697
I was hoping something
had eaten him by now.

344
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:40,029
- Can I help you with something?
- Suzie called us.

345
00:35:40,205 --> 00:35:42,264
Where would we find her?

346
00:35:43,509 --> 00:35:45,409
You know the way.

347
00:35:51,783 --> 00:35:54,547
You won't shoot her, will you?

348
00:35:56,855 --> 00:35:59,551
I don't believe she's armed.

349
00:36:35,627 --> 00:36:37,026
Yeah?

350
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:43,496
Jesus, it took you guys
long enough.

351
00:36:43,669 --> 00:36:48,470
What if someone was trying to
strangle me or fuck me in the ass?

352
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,700
I mean,
you guys do sex crimes, right?

353
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:55,845
My partner, Detective Perez.

354
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:06,153
It's Céline. He's okay. He had a good
line on what cheap fucks people are.

355
00:37:06,325 --> 00:37:09,089
Yeah, so Suzie, you called us.
Remember?

356
00:37:17,135 --> 00:37:19,626
Did they arrest Mr. Lombardo?

357
00:37:21,206 --> 00:37:22,901
No.

358
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:26,901
- Will they?
- I don't know.

359
00:37:27,512 --> 00:37:28,945
That bothers you?

360
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:34,318
I wanna go outside.

361
00:37:41,326 --> 00:37:44,454
When was this that Sam Lombardo
gave you the ride?

362
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,621
About a year ago.

363
00:37:46,798 --> 00:37:49,961
And when you arrived at your trailer,
was anyone there?

364
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:52,729
- Nope.
- So you were alone.

365
00:37:52,904 --> 00:37:54,565
Yeah.

366
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,571
Did he come in with you?

367
00:37:56,742 --> 00:38:01,338
- I guess.
- You guess. Well, did he or didn't he?

368
00:38:01,513 --> 00:38:04,448
Okay. Yeah, he did.

369
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:06,208
And then what? Did he touch you?

370
00:38:06,385 --> 00:38:09,320
Did you maybe flirt with him a little?

371
00:38:09,988 --> 00:38:12,889
Suzie, look, I know you feel bad.

372
00:38:13,425 --> 00:38:17,486
- Just tell us the truth.
- I didn't say a thing to him.

373
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:22,331
He just put his arm around me
and told me I was pretty.

374
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:25,626
I could be really pretty, he said.

375
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:28,033
Did you ask him to stop?

376
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,731
Shit.

377
00:38:31,176 --> 00:38:33,974
What difference does it make?
No one believes me anyway.

378
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:37,377
- Did Sam Lombardo rape you?
- Yeah. Okay? He did.

379
00:38:37,549 --> 00:38:39,847
He pushed me to the floor
and he did it to me.

380
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,884
- Now are we done?
- Almost, Suzie.

381
00:38:45,057 --> 00:38:46,820
Almost.

382
00:38:47,893 --> 00:38:50,521
At some point,
were you able to fight him off?

383
00:38:51,563 --> 00:38:55,055
No. He stopped by himself.

384
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:58,727
Okay? Is that it?
Leave me alone.

385
00:38:59,271 --> 00:39:02,707
- Don't touch me!
- All right, take it easy. Take it easy.

386
00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:04,671
He stopped.

387
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:08,074
And that was it? He just left?

388
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,445
Yeah.

389
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:14,281
He did say one thing first.

390
00:39:14,553 --> 00:39:16,020
What was that?

391
00:39:16,755 --> 00:39:20,782
He said, "No little bitch
can ever make me come."

392
00:39:23,795 --> 00:39:25,626
Open the gate.

393
00:39:31,069 --> 00:39:34,436
- Hey, counselor, how about a smoke?
- Hello, Jinxy.

394
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:40,974
You know, it's really a
bad news, good news situation.

395
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:45,849
You were denied bail,
but you got a real attorney...

396
00:39:46,017 --> 00:39:48,042
...instead of a public defender.

397
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:51,454
I'm telling you, Ken, I'm innocent.

398
00:39:52,324 --> 00:39:56,124
You are preaching to the choir.
You're not alone.

399
00:40:03,235 --> 00:40:05,635
So you're the new
chicken licker.

400
00:40:14,813 --> 00:40:16,508
Sandra, can we get your comment?

401
00:40:16,681 --> 00:40:18,808
Can I just have your feelings
at this time?

402
00:40:18,984 --> 00:40:21,452
Mr. Lombardo will get
what he deserves.

403
00:40:22,154 --> 00:40:23,746
Can you tell us anything?

404
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:26,254
- Are you confident about the case?
- Very. Yes.

405
00:40:26,425 --> 00:40:29,292
The Lombardo rape case
has galvanized the upscale town...

406
00:40:29,461 --> 00:40:31,452
...of Blue Bay with its tabloid appeal.

407
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,530
Now just arriving, Sandra Van Ryan...

408
00:40:33,698 --> 00:40:37,566
...jet-set real estate heiress
and part of the powerful Blue Bay elite.

409
00:40:37,736 --> 00:40:41,399
And the girl from the wrong side of the
tracks. In the end, the jury...

410
00:40:41,573 --> 00:40:44,440
...must choose between the words
of these 18-year-old girls...

411
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:46,201
...and that of Sam Lombardo.

412
00:40:46,378 --> 00:40:49,040
Reporting from the courthouse steps,
I'm Nancy Duerr.

413
00:40:49,214 --> 00:40:50,875
Eyewitness News.

414
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:33,089
The State of Florida
v. Sam Lombardo.

415
00:41:33,258 --> 00:41:37,160
The Honorable Sylvia B. Waxman
presiding. All rise.

416
00:41:37,462 --> 00:41:39,362
We gotta stand up.

417
00:41:43,034 --> 00:41:44,524
Please be seated.

418
00:41:44,703 --> 00:41:46,364
Now sit down.

419
00:42:00,352 --> 00:42:02,183
Would you like more time, Kelly?

420
00:42:07,759 --> 00:42:10,887
I know that this is hard, Kelly...

421
00:42:12,097 --> 00:42:14,065
...but I have one more question.

422
00:42:14,232 --> 00:42:17,099
And even though it's something
we've been over...

423
00:42:17,269 --> 00:42:20,500
...I want us all
to be very clear about it.

424
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:25,442
Kelly, when you saw
that Mr. Lombardo...

425
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:28,808
...intended to have sex with you...

426
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,107
...what were your exact words?

427
00:42:31,683 --> 00:42:33,583
What did you say?

428
00:42:34,786 --> 00:42:37,220
I told him "No."

429
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:41,052
I said,
"Stop, Mr. Lombardo. Please."

430
00:42:43,628 --> 00:42:46,654
I screamed for him to stop.

431
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:49,097
You screamed for him...

432
00:42:49,868 --> 00:42:51,665
...to stop.

433
00:42:52,804 --> 00:42:54,601
And did he?

434
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:57,769
No.

435
00:42:58,643 --> 00:43:01,771
He raped me on the floor
of his shitty house.

436
00:43:10,055 --> 00:43:11,920
Thank you.

437
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:18,096
It's day two of the Lombardo rape case
and the second alleged young victim...

438
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:21,862
It's day two of the Lombardo rape case
and the second alleged young victim...

439
00:43:22,033 --> 00:43:24,831
...of the former guidance counselor
has taken the stand.

440
00:43:25,003 --> 00:43:28,803
Yesterday, Kelly Van Ryan delivered
an emotional account of events...

441
00:43:28,974 --> 00:43:32,410
...and was not swayed by
defense counsel's cross-examination.

442
00:43:32,577 --> 00:43:35,774
We'll come back live later
with an update of these proceedings.

443
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:38,745
Reporting from the courthouse
steps, I'm Nancy Duerr...

444
00:43:38,917 --> 00:43:40,817
...Eyewitness News.

445
00:43:59,504 --> 00:44:01,165
Good morning, everybody.

446
00:44:03,408 --> 00:44:04,841
Ms. Toller.

447
00:44:06,277 --> 00:44:08,302
When you were...

448
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:12,109
...picked up for shoplifting
your freshman year at Blue Bay...

449
00:44:12,283 --> 00:44:15,343
...and you were allowed
to make one call...

450
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,683
...you called Mr. Lombardo.
Isn't that correct?

451
00:44:20,058 --> 00:44:21,753
Ms. Toller?

452
00:44:22,427 --> 00:44:24,657
- Yes.
- And when you were expelled...

453
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:27,195
...for destruction
of school property...

454
00:44:27,365 --> 00:44:30,596
I broke a fucking window.
And it wasn't even my fault.

455
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:35,362
Ms. Toller, you will wait until
you are asked before responding...

456
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:38,839
...and you will refrain from
using profanity in this court.

457
00:44:42,947 --> 00:44:46,644
It was Mr. Lombardo who appeared
with you in lieu of a parent conference.

458
00:44:46,818 --> 00:44:48,308
Is that right?

459
00:44:48,486 --> 00:44:49,851
Yes.

460
00:44:51,322 --> 00:44:53,256
It seems to me...

461
00:44:53,425 --> 00:44:56,758
...that Mr. Lombardo
was your friend.

462
00:44:56,928 --> 00:44:58,623
He was.

463
00:44:59,798 --> 00:45:02,767
But all that changed when...

464
00:45:04,102 --> 00:45:06,400
...according to your testimony...

465
00:45:07,238 --> 00:45:09,399
...Mr. Lombardo...

466
00:45:09,574 --> 00:45:11,303
...raped you...

467
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:16,643
...on April 23 of last year,
is that right?

468
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:19,577
- Yes.
- But then in May...

469
00:45:20,218 --> 00:45:23,745
...when you were arrested
for possession of narcotics...

470
00:45:23,922 --> 00:45:26,413
...and again allowed a phone call...

471
00:45:28,026 --> 00:45:29,550
...you called Mr. Lombardo.

472
00:45:34,666 --> 00:45:37,965
- So what?
- So what?

473
00:45:40,872 --> 00:45:42,567
So what?

474
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,106
Oops, Suzie.

475
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:53,013
So one month after you say this man
raped you, you go to him for help?

476
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:58,783
Sounds as if you still considered
Mr. Lombardo a good friend.

477
00:45:58,957 --> 00:46:01,517
- I needed help.
- I'm sure you did.

478
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:03,851
But Mr. Lombardo
wasn't there this time.

479
00:46:04,028 --> 00:46:05,757
It was summer, he was gone...

480
00:46:06,364 --> 00:46:10,528
...and you spent six months
in a state correctional facility.

481
00:46:11,002 --> 00:46:13,095
Did that make you mad, Suzie...

482
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:16,968
...that Sam was gone?
That he wasn't there?

483
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:21,877
Is that why you're saying
these things about Mr. Lombardo...

484
00:46:22,046 --> 00:46:24,640
...your friend?
- I said them because they happened.

485
00:46:24,816 --> 00:46:27,614
Ms. Toller, are you gonna
sit there today, under oath...

486
00:46:27,786 --> 00:46:30,152
...and swear that Samuel Lombardo
raped you?

487
00:46:30,321 --> 00:46:32,346
I said he did.

488
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:35,181
Let me ask you a question,
Ms. Toller.

489
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:38,989
Did you enjoy
being a guest of the state?

490
00:46:39,497 --> 00:46:42,159
Because I promise you,
if you are lying about this...

491
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:43,960
...and I believe you are...

492
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:47,593
...that you will be visiting
that facility again quite soon.

493
00:46:47,872 --> 00:46:51,933
Which is why I'm gonna ask you
again now, under oath.

494
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:53,771
Suzie...

495
00:46:55,013 --> 00:46:57,208
...did Samuel Lombardo rape you?

496
00:47:01,886 --> 00:47:05,287
Ms. Toller, you will have to
answer the question.

497
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,487
- Ms. Toller.
- Goddamn it!

498
00:47:14,032 --> 00:47:16,330
- This was not my idea.
- Objection, Your Honor.

499
00:47:16,668 --> 00:47:20,160
Ms. Toller is clearly responding
to defense counsel's badgering.

500
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:23,535
Court would like to hear
what Ms. Toller has to say.

501
00:47:23,775 --> 00:47:25,800
Ms. Toller?

502
00:47:28,746 --> 00:47:31,180
Sam Lombardo didn't rape me.

503
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:34,945
He didn't rape Kelly either.
He didn't do anything.

504
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:39,556
This is ridiculous. The witness has
been threatened by defense counsel!

505
00:47:39,724 --> 00:47:43,251
I think I made it plain this court
intends to hear Ms. Toller's story.

506
00:47:45,129 --> 00:47:46,926
Ms. Toller.

507
00:47:48,099 --> 00:47:50,897
I just wanted to hurt
Mr. Lombardo.

508
00:47:51,603 --> 00:47:54,629
He was my friend at first.

509
00:47:54,806 --> 00:47:57,866
And then I got busted,
and he didn't stick up for me...

510
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:00,442
...and I had to go away
to that hell hole.

511
00:48:00,612 --> 00:48:03,206
It's like you're his favorite,
and then "Who cares?"

512
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:04,814
Make her stop.

513
00:48:04,983 --> 00:48:07,417
When Kelly said that
we should do this...

514
00:48:07,585 --> 00:48:09,450
...I thought, "Cool."
- Kelly!

515
00:48:09,621 --> 00:48:12,920
All these big shots screwing me over,
like that cop, Duquette.

516
00:48:13,091 --> 00:48:16,288
- Now they're gonna get screwed.
- I'm sorry, Your Honor.

517
00:48:16,461 --> 00:48:17,758
I have to object.

518
00:48:17,929 --> 00:48:20,693
Your Honor, please, may I be heard?

519
00:48:20,865 --> 00:48:24,733
Mr. Baxter, you are not
trying this case.

520
00:48:24,903 --> 00:48:26,165
Go sit down.

521
00:48:31,576 --> 00:48:33,908
Kelly's pissed
at Mr. Lombardo too.

522
00:48:34,712 --> 00:48:36,942
She's in love with him.

523
00:48:37,115 --> 00:48:39,379
He's been her fantasy
since her old man died.

524
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:42,417
Then she found out he was doing
her mom, and that was it.

525
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:44,487
What? Kelly!

526
00:48:44,656 --> 00:48:46,817
You skanky bitch!

527
00:48:47,825 --> 00:48:50,919
Get your fucking hands off of me!
Don't you know who I am?

528
00:48:51,095 --> 00:48:54,223
- I'm gonna have you fired on Monday!
- Right this way.

529
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:01,600
Just get the hell away from me.

530
00:49:03,908 --> 00:49:05,842
Jesus, man! Let loose!

531
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:10,137
I'm just thinking about where
I'm gonna stay.

532
00:49:10,315 --> 00:49:12,579
I lost my house.

533
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:14,809
Waking up from
a goddamn nightmare.

534
00:49:14,986 --> 00:49:16,476
You'll get over it.

535
00:49:16,654 --> 00:49:19,782
We have got a knockdown,
airtight, motherfucker lawsuit...

536
00:49:19,958 --> 00:49:22,290
...against Sandra Van Ryan.

537
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,291
Just like that?

538
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:25,724
Just like that?

539
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:28,523
These people ruined your life, bro.

540
00:49:28,866 --> 00:49:33,303
I told you they were gonna go too far.
They went overboard! They did!

541
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:37,931
They'll settle. Believe me.
They'll be begging to settle.

542
00:49:38,409 --> 00:49:41,810
Oh, yeah! Here we go!
Hey, wait up! Come on, girl.

543
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:45,245
In a startling turn of events,
Sam Lombardo has been dismissed...

544
00:49:45,416 --> 00:49:48,977
...following a reversal of testimony
by one of his alleged victims.

545
00:49:49,253 --> 00:49:51,187
Excuse me. Over here.

546
00:49:51,356 --> 00:49:53,051
Excuse me. Can anybody read?

547
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:57,018
Hey! Sandra!

548
00:49:57,228 --> 00:50:01,164
I want you to nail that shyster's balls
to the nearest wall.

549
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:04,301
We could have,
if Ms. Not-So-Bright here...

550
00:50:04,469 --> 00:50:06,528
...hadn't thrown things.
- Fuck off.

551
00:50:06,704 --> 00:50:11,698
I cannot believe you're just gonna
let them get away with this shit!

552
00:50:11,876 --> 00:50:14,504
All on the word of
one little white-trash bitch.

553
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:17,648
I don't think you get it, Sandy.

554
00:50:17,815 --> 00:50:19,806
Your princess here
committed perjury.

555
00:50:20,451 --> 00:50:23,750
It'll be all I can do to keep
her fucking little ass out of jail.

556
00:50:23,921 --> 00:50:26,981
Well, what are we going to do?

557
00:50:34,565 --> 00:50:37,466
- You're gonna love this place, Tom.
- Thank you.

558
00:50:38,903 --> 00:50:41,064
That jalapeño pork platter
will kill you.

559
00:50:43,641 --> 00:50:46,667
I mean, you can't eat sushi every day
of the week.

560
00:50:46,844 --> 00:50:49,244
Bowden, why don't you
cut the crap...

561
00:50:49,414 --> 00:50:52,383
...and tell me
what your client really wants.

562
00:50:55,286 --> 00:50:57,254
Okay, Baxter.

563
00:50:57,422 --> 00:51:01,324
My client wants your client
to saddle up...

564
00:51:01,492 --> 00:51:04,052
...so we can ride her ass
straight to the bank.

565
00:51:07,331 --> 00:51:10,300
You know, Ken.

566
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:11,830
May I call you Ken?

567
00:51:13,905 --> 00:51:16,601
There will be other cases,
other days.

568
00:51:19,177 --> 00:51:21,543
The way I see it...

569
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,009
...Tommy...

570
00:51:24,182 --> 00:51:27,515
...is that everybody's gotta
eat some shit sometime.

571
00:51:29,454 --> 00:51:31,217
You like yours hot?

572
00:51:31,389 --> 00:51:33,186
Yeah.

573
00:51:41,165 --> 00:51:44,100
- Here's your coffee, Sam.
- Thank you.

574
00:51:57,682 --> 00:51:59,377
Ken.

575
00:52:11,496 --> 00:52:13,760
Sorry I'm late.

576
00:52:13,931 --> 00:52:15,364
Hold my calls, Lenore.

577
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,561
Okay, Mr. Bowden.

578
00:52:40,224 --> 00:52:42,249
Thank you, Sandra.

579
00:52:47,698 --> 00:52:49,598
I'll be seeing you.

580
00:52:49,767 --> 00:52:52,031
- Okay?
- Okay. Yeah.

581
00:52:58,209 --> 00:53:00,439
Nice to see you, Tom.

582
00:53:00,778 --> 00:53:02,370
Come by.
We'll have lunch.

583
00:53:05,917 --> 00:53:08,078
See you at the club.

584
00:53:10,321 --> 00:53:12,346
See you at the club.

585
00:53:13,057 --> 00:53:15,218
See you at the club.

586
00:53:15,426 --> 00:53:17,417
See you at the club.

587
00:53:18,062 --> 00:53:19,723
See you at the club, Tommy!

588
00:53:19,897 --> 00:53:22,923
Hey, Tom.
What did you shoot today, pal?

589
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:25,159
Hey, my man!

590
00:53:27,205 --> 00:53:29,298
This is for you.

591
00:53:30,341 --> 00:53:32,070
- You did good, Ken.
- Yeah.

592
00:53:32,243 --> 00:53:33,938
Thanks.

593
00:53:35,112 --> 00:53:39,139
I know there's a part of you that wishes
none of this had happened, but it did.

594
00:53:39,317 --> 00:53:42,115
So take the money
and enjoy yourself.

595
00:53:42,286 --> 00:53:45,312
All right? Find a happy place.

596
00:53:45,523 --> 00:53:48,219
Lenore, would you see
Mr. Lombardo out, please?

597
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:51,623
- Goodbye, Sam.
- Bye, Lenore.

598
00:54:09,146 --> 00:54:11,580
Take care of my lizards?

599
00:54:19,924 --> 00:54:21,186
Hello, Kelly.

600
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:23,351
Drop dead.

601
00:54:23,527 --> 00:54:27,759
You know how my mom's paying you
off? She's breaking my trust.

602
00:54:28,132 --> 00:54:32,364
I can't touch it until she's dead,
and now she's breaking it to pay you.

603
00:54:32,536 --> 00:54:33,798
I'm sorry, Kelly.

604
00:54:33,971 --> 00:54:36,963
Why don't you start fucking her
again! You can spend it together!

605
00:54:37,141 --> 00:54:39,803
I hate you! I fucking hate you,
you son of a bitch!

606
00:54:40,344 --> 00:54:42,278
I fucking hate you!

607
00:54:54,492 --> 00:54:58,519
You see, Art? I couldn't come back
even if I wanted to.

608
00:55:36,167 --> 00:55:38,226
Goddamn maid.

609
00:56:13,838 --> 00:56:15,772
So you got my mom's money.

610
00:56:17,475 --> 00:56:19,067
How much?

611
00:56:19,977 --> 00:56:21,467
How much?

612
00:56:22,213 --> 00:56:24,477
You know how much.

613
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:26,546
Your turn to pay.

614
00:56:29,754 --> 00:56:33,087
It worked! We screwed the bitch!

615
00:56:33,924 --> 00:56:36,620
It worked just like you said.

616
00:56:37,862 --> 00:56:39,420
What's wrong?

617
00:56:39,597 --> 00:56:42,862
You scared the shit out of me.
What's wrong is your coming here.

618
00:56:43,033 --> 00:56:46,662
That's what's wrong.
Are you fucking crazy?

619
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:51,139
Yeah, I'm crazy. Ask my mom.

620
00:56:54,478 --> 00:56:57,811
So how much is 8.5 million
divided by three?

621
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:02,079
Oh, great. Yeah, this is a big joke.
Big joke.

622
00:57:02,253 --> 00:57:06,189
Everyone thinks this is really funny.
Do you think this is fucking over?

623
00:57:06,357 --> 00:57:09,884
Let me tell you something.
It's a long fucking way from over.

624
00:57:11,295 --> 00:57:13,456
I'm serious.

625
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:19,859
After tonight the three of us
are not to be seen together again.

626
00:57:22,673 --> 00:57:24,197
After tonight?

627
00:57:25,142 --> 00:57:26,905
Yeah, well...

628
00:57:27,445 --> 00:57:29,470
...we're here, aren't we?

629
00:57:32,349 --> 00:57:34,977
So maybe one celebration
is okay...

630
00:57:35,719 --> 00:57:37,880
...if we're in agreement...

631
00:57:38,823 --> 00:57:40,654
...that from here on out...

632
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:45,424
...you do exactly as I say.

633
00:58:27,938 --> 00:58:31,430
Guidance counselors get to find out
all sorts of interesting things.

634
00:58:44,154 --> 00:58:46,622
Now I want you two to kiss.

635
00:58:48,259 --> 00:58:50,227
Come on, now.

636
00:58:50,394 --> 00:58:53,488
Never let the sun go down
on an argument.

637
01:00:10,874 --> 01:00:14,241
I told you they were
gonna make us look stupid.

638
01:00:14,845 --> 01:00:18,645
Hey, you're right.
They did make us look stupid.

639
01:00:19,216 --> 01:00:21,207
What you're wrong about is why.

640
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:23,351
All right, hear me out.

641
01:00:23,821 --> 01:00:26,756
Lombardo was having an affair
with Sandra Van Ryan, right?

642
01:00:26,924 --> 01:00:28,221
Why not tell us about it?

643
01:00:28,392 --> 01:00:31,725
That's a hell of a motive
for Kelly to fabricate this story.

644
01:00:31,895 --> 01:00:34,989
Maybe Lombardo's attorney
was saving the affair for the trial.

645
01:00:35,165 --> 01:00:38,498
I thought about it and said: "You're
Lombardo. Your life is trashed.

646
01:00:38,669 --> 01:00:41,570
You don't wanna sit in jail
for three months unless..."

647
01:00:41,739 --> 01:00:43,468
Unless what?

648
01:00:45,409 --> 01:00:48,776
Unless you're setting Sandra
Van Ryan up for the big payday.

649
01:00:48,946 --> 01:00:52,382
Lombardo was eyeball-deep in debt
before this whole thing started...

650
01:00:52,549 --> 01:00:56,485
...trying to keep up with a pricey girl
like Barbara Baxter. That's expensive.

651
01:00:56,654 --> 01:00:59,088
Lombardo may be broke,
but why would Kelly steal?

652
01:00:59,256 --> 01:01:03,158
Kid's got money from her grandfather
she can't touch until her mother dies.

653
01:01:03,427 --> 01:01:07,727
I'm telling you,
this guy wanted to marry money.

654
01:01:08,465 --> 01:01:11,992
When that didn't happen,
he went to work on these two girls...

655
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:14,160
...using them to set up
Sandra Van Ryan.

656
01:01:14,338 --> 01:01:16,568
I'm telling you,
they chumped us, partner.

657
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:19,709
They chumped us
right from the start.

658
01:02:14,198 --> 01:02:16,029
Nice stroke.

659
01:02:17,735 --> 01:02:19,726
Is there some reason
why you're here?

660
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:22,167
- Curiosity, I guess.
- About what?

661
01:02:22,339 --> 01:02:25,035
How to improve your breast stroke?

662
01:02:26,543 --> 01:02:30,673
No. I want to know how you see things
working out for you, Sam and Suzie.

663
01:02:32,449 --> 01:02:33,711
Excuse me?

664
01:02:33,884 --> 01:02:36,216
You three gonna
go to the Caribbean together?

665
01:02:36,386 --> 01:02:37,819
Live happily ever after?

666
01:02:38,222 --> 01:02:41,385
You see, the thing about it is that
threesomes rarely work out.

667
01:02:41,558 --> 01:02:42,820
You're out of your mind.

668
01:02:42,993 --> 01:02:46,326
It's hard enough for one person
to keep a secret, let alone three.

669
01:02:46,497 --> 01:02:49,364
Especially when
two of them are in love.

670
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:54,165
You and Sam don't want that pill-head
around now that you have the money.

671
01:02:55,139 --> 01:02:56,606
Am I right?

672
01:02:56,774 --> 01:03:00,107
Sam sell you on the idea right up
front of whacking Suzie? Hey!

673
01:03:01,779 --> 01:03:03,610
That's murder, kid.

674
01:03:03,781 --> 01:03:06,944
Police. God, get a life.

675
01:03:08,652 --> 01:03:10,620
You're good, you know that?

676
01:03:12,523 --> 01:03:16,584
But you don't think that little freak
Suzie's gonna hold up, do you?

677
01:03:37,714 --> 01:03:39,909
Hello, Suzie.

678
01:03:40,784 --> 01:03:42,513
You better watch it
with that shit.

679
01:03:42,686 --> 01:03:45,382
You get busted again,
you go back in a two-time loser.

680
01:03:45,556 --> 01:03:47,717
Yeah, or wind up dead.

681
01:03:54,998 --> 01:03:56,625
You know...

682
01:03:57,835 --> 01:04:01,965
...I don't think I ever told you
how sorry I was about your friend.

683
01:04:02,272 --> 01:04:04,172
What was his name?

684
01:04:07,411 --> 01:04:10,938
Come on, help me out here, Suzie.
You know his name.

685
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:17,850
- Davy.
- Yeah. That's right. Davy.

686
01:04:18,121 --> 01:04:20,248
I was sorry about
the way that worked out.

687
01:04:20,424 --> 01:04:23,222
- That is cop bullshit.
- What was that? What was that?

688
01:04:23,393 --> 01:04:26,362
I don't have to listen to this.
You can't shove me around.

689
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:28,725
- I have friends now.
- Hey!

690
01:04:28,899 --> 01:04:31,663
This is Ray, Suzie.
You don't have shit!

691
01:04:31,835 --> 01:04:35,362
You never had shit
and you never will have shit.

692
01:04:39,776 --> 01:04:41,744
Take a look at this.

693
01:04:42,479 --> 01:04:44,947
Go ahead, take it.
It's not gonna bite you.

694
01:04:45,449 --> 01:04:46,711
Take it!

695
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:53,550
Your friend Sam
deposited the check.

696
01:04:54,858 --> 01:04:58,919
He transferred the funds to
a numbered offshore account.

697
01:04:59,096 --> 01:05:02,122
Cops don't know the names on it.
Think one of them is yours?

698
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:07,298
He also put a down payment on island
property and a lease on a sailboat.

699
01:05:07,471 --> 01:05:09,098
You're into sailing, aren't you?

700
01:05:09,273 --> 01:05:12,436
I don't know why you're telling me this.
Why are you here?

701
01:05:12,609 --> 01:05:15,669
I'm telling you this because
I know exactly what's going on.

702
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:19,913
Two's company.
Three's a crowd.

703
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:22,017
Come on, now.

704
01:05:22,185 --> 01:05:25,780
You don't think Kelly and Sam are
gonna share that money with you.

705
01:05:28,025 --> 01:05:30,016
Leave me alone.

706
01:05:38,502 --> 01:05:40,060
You know...

707
01:05:40,237 --> 01:05:42,933
...l'd want a clear head
right now if I were you...

708
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:47,836
...so I could keep a real close eye
on my new friends.

709
01:05:49,079 --> 01:05:52,048
I'd hate to see you
come to a bad end...

710
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:54,246
...like Davy.

711
01:06:06,797 --> 01:06:08,025
Oh, shit.

712
01:06:14,504 --> 01:06:18,463
You've reached Sam Lombardo.
Wait for the beep, leave a message.

713
01:06:33,457 --> 01:06:36,790
I can't believe you called Sam.
What's the matter with you?

714
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,292
I'm scared there's no one to trust.

715
01:06:39,463 --> 01:06:41,795
You can trust me.

716
01:06:48,572 --> 01:06:50,005
Hello?

717
01:06:50,674 --> 01:06:53,234
- Kelly, is Suzie there?
- Yeah.

718
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:55,378
Christ, I was afraid of that.

719
01:06:55,545 --> 01:06:57,513
She left this insane message.

720
01:06:57,681 --> 01:07:00,149
Between whatever she's
been smoking out there...

721
01:07:00,317 --> 01:07:02,615
...and this fucking cop,
she's gonna blow it.

722
01:07:03,854 --> 01:07:05,617
Calm the bitch down.

723
01:07:05,789 --> 01:07:08,758
Why can't you come? Please?

724
01:07:09,493 --> 01:07:13,054
Sam, I miss you so much.

725
01:07:15,565 --> 01:07:19,558
I miss you too, Kelly,
but I can't right now.

726
01:07:19,736 --> 01:07:21,727
We gotta stick to the plan, okay?

727
01:07:22,806 --> 01:07:24,671
If she can't get a fucking grip...

728
01:07:24,841 --> 01:07:27,901
- Then what?
- You know what.

729
01:07:28,545 --> 01:07:30,274
I'll handle it.

730
01:07:30,447 --> 01:07:33,814
But I need you, Kelly.
I need you to be there for me tonight.

731
01:07:35,052 --> 01:07:37,247
- Okay.
- Good.

732
01:07:37,421 --> 01:07:40,288
That's my girl.
You're the strong one, you know that?

733
01:07:41,525 --> 01:07:44,961
Now, put Suzie on the line.
I want you both to hear this.

734
01:07:45,962 --> 01:07:47,657
Suzie.

735
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:50,226
Sam?

736
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,890
Now, look...

737
01:07:52,069 --> 01:07:54,970
...we gotta stay calm, all of us.

738
01:07:55,138 --> 01:07:58,369
Now, since the settlement,
people think I'm rich...

739
01:07:58,542 --> 01:08:01,909
...so I'm out there spending money,
doing what rich guys do.

740
01:08:02,546 --> 01:08:06,004
This cop, Duquette, he's gonna try
and fuck with you. Don't let him.

741
01:08:06,183 --> 01:08:10,313
- Yeah, that's easy for you to say.
- Suzie, don't fall apart.

742
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:13,387
The only people who
can fuck this up is us.

743
01:08:22,265 --> 01:08:24,324
You are gonna fuck me over,
aren't you?

744
01:08:24,501 --> 01:08:26,526
Oh, for chrissake.

745
01:08:26,703 --> 01:08:28,193
You are!

746
01:08:28,371 --> 01:08:32,774
Are you retarded, or just brain-dead
from whiffing fumes out in the swamp?

747
01:08:32,943 --> 01:08:37,676
That's what I am to you, isn't it?
Swamp trash, just like my mom.

748
01:08:38,915 --> 01:08:40,143
Don't!

749
01:08:43,987 --> 01:08:46,353
You stupid cunt!

750
01:09:18,555 --> 01:09:20,921
You are scared, aren't you?

751
01:10:45,642 --> 01:10:49,134
Ray! Jesus Christ!

752
01:10:49,512 --> 01:10:51,503
- Are you crazy?
- Hear her say "Sam"?

753
01:10:51,815 --> 01:10:54,909
That was Lombardo on the phone.
And you saw the two girls.

754
01:10:55,085 --> 01:10:57,417
The conversation on the tape
is unintelligible.

755
01:10:57,587 --> 01:11:00,181
What we have here is you
on the Van Ryan property...

756
01:11:00,357 --> 01:11:03,190
...shooting a porn flick!
- I can't believe this.

757
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:06,295
A month ago, they threw things
at each other in court.

758
01:11:06,463 --> 01:11:09,091
They were acting!
They were all acting!

759
01:11:09,266 --> 01:11:11,097
We bought it, hook, line and sinker.

760
01:11:11,268 --> 01:11:14,203
They're getting away with $8 million
from Sandra Van Ryan.

761
01:11:14,371 --> 01:11:17,067
She might have saved it
if she didn't try to ruin him.

762
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:20,471
You wouldn't go after a guy
you thought raped your daughter?

763
01:11:20,644 --> 01:11:22,976
She bought the same
goddamn story we did!

764
01:11:23,146 --> 01:11:27,014
Both of you, you're not on a case,
because there is no fucking case!

765
01:11:27,484 --> 01:11:30,681
I've had it with Sandra Van Ryan,
and you keep mucking around...

766
01:11:30,854 --> 01:11:33,345
...and she's gonna sue us
for invasion of privacy.

767
01:11:33,523 --> 01:11:36,117
So get out of these people's lives!
Hey! Ray!

768
01:11:36,993 --> 01:11:40,827
- Hey! Am I getting through?
- You think this is just about money?

769
01:11:40,997 --> 01:11:43,124
About us looking stupid?
Question him.

770
01:11:44,234 --> 01:11:48,432
You'll find a manipulative psychopath,
and those girls will wind up dead.

771
01:11:48,605 --> 01:11:50,004
Give him something to do.

772
01:11:50,173 --> 01:11:52,835
- Look into the Kennedy assassination.
- I understand.

773
01:11:53,009 --> 01:11:55,534
Next time this fucking piece of shit...

774
01:11:55,712 --> 01:11:57,737
...drags me down here,
I'm gonna sue you.

775
01:11:57,914 --> 01:12:00,246
You're goddamn lucky
I didn't sue last time.

776
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:02,509
- I agree.
- Am I free to go?

777
01:12:02,686 --> 01:12:04,881
- Yes.
- Thank you.

778
01:12:07,157 --> 01:12:09,990
- Cocksucker.
- Yeah, what was that?

779
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:13,857
- You heard me, motherfucker.
- Yeah, you wanna say that to my face?

780
01:12:17,534 --> 01:12:19,229
What are you looking at?

781
01:13:03,279 --> 01:13:06,646
- I guess I kind of lost it out there.
- You could say that.

782
01:13:11,054 --> 01:13:14,148
Were you ever in a situation
where you saw something coming...

783
01:13:14,324 --> 01:13:16,656
...and you didn't do
what you could to stop it?

784
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:18,625
We all have.

785
01:13:18,795 --> 01:13:22,663
I mean something bad that you
saw coming, and then it happened...

786
01:13:23,233 --> 01:13:26,464
...and you...
You didn't do anything, and...

787
01:13:30,573 --> 01:13:32,404
I did that once.

788
01:13:34,411 --> 01:13:36,538
I don't wanna do it again.

789
01:13:55,365 --> 01:13:57,663
I thought we were going to a movie.

790
01:14:00,036 --> 01:14:02,971
I think we just need to get wasted.

791
01:14:03,606 --> 01:14:05,267
Yeah.

792
01:14:23,092 --> 01:14:24,650
Come on.

793
01:14:31,468 --> 01:14:34,130
I wanna live at the beach someday.

794
01:14:34,471 --> 01:14:36,166
Oh, shit.

795
01:14:36,339 --> 01:14:39,035
I left the keys.

796
01:14:39,209 --> 01:14:40,767
I'll get them.

797
01:15:00,563 --> 01:15:01,928
Kelly?

798
01:15:02,098 --> 01:15:03,725
Suzie.

799
01:15:06,236 --> 01:15:07,999
It's me.

800
01:15:12,809 --> 01:15:15,778
I was worried about you,
and I decided...

801
01:15:15,945 --> 01:15:20,211
...the three of us should get together
one last time before we split up.

802
01:15:20,817 --> 01:15:23,752
- Are you mad at me?
- No, no.

803
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:26,354
I probably should've told you
a bit more about...

804
01:15:26,523 --> 01:15:28,821
...the part I intended to play.

805
01:15:28,992 --> 01:15:30,926
But we'll go through it again tonight.

806
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:39,157
This is a celebration, Suzie,
not a suicide pact.

807
01:15:39,369 --> 01:15:43,271
We're gonna chill out
and just relax...

808
01:15:43,439 --> 01:15:45,964
...have a little champagne...

809
01:15:46,142 --> 01:15:47,939
...watch the stars...

810
01:15:49,045 --> 01:15:50,376
Kelly?

811
01:15:50,547 --> 01:15:53,209
You got a blanket in the back
of your mom's Rover?

812
01:15:54,317 --> 01:15:57,309
Why don't you be an angel
and run over and get it for us?

813
01:15:59,923 --> 01:16:01,584
Good girl.

814
01:16:03,226 --> 01:16:05,751
Let me tell you about the boat
I picked out for us.

815
01:17:09,092 --> 01:17:10,787
You okay?

816
01:17:12,328 --> 01:17:15,627
My mom would kill me
if she knew I took the Rover.

817
01:18:16,125 --> 01:18:17,353
Been four-wheeling?

818
01:18:19,062 --> 01:18:21,530
- Get off my property!
- I'm not on your property.

819
01:18:21,698 --> 01:18:24,895
- Lf you don't get out of here...
- You'll call a cop? I am a cop!

820
01:18:25,501 --> 01:18:26,729
Goddamn it!

821
01:18:48,691 --> 01:18:50,852
So you say she didn't
come home last night.

822
01:18:51,027 --> 01:18:55,327
She's been talking about going to L.A.,
but her clothes are all still here.

823
01:18:55,498 --> 01:18:58,558
Walter! You get sick,
it'll serve you right.

824
01:19:01,337 --> 01:19:04,465
Found some teeth in an old trailer
down the road.

825
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:06,699
He says they'll fit.

826
01:19:07,176 --> 01:19:10,839
Suzie hasn't been back to school
since the trial.

827
01:19:11,013 --> 01:19:14,710
Oh, and now they're saying
that she can't graduate.

828
01:19:14,884 --> 01:19:18,945
It is that Kelly Van Ryan that got her
into this whole mess, and you know it.

829
01:19:19,122 --> 01:19:21,317
Well, we'll look into it for you, Ruby.

830
01:19:21,491 --> 01:19:24,483
We find something,
you'll be the first to know.

831
01:19:25,962 --> 01:19:27,361
Come on.

832
01:19:45,815 --> 01:19:48,215
It's starting, Gloria.
This is how it begins.

833
01:19:48,384 --> 01:19:51,512
Ray, we don't know anything yet.
She could be anywhere.

834
01:19:51,687 --> 01:19:54,178
I'll drop you off.
Put a call out on Suzie's car.

835
01:19:54,357 --> 01:19:55,984
You got someplace you wanna be?

836
01:19:56,826 --> 01:20:00,057
- You got a date?
- Just check the car out for me.

837
01:20:09,806 --> 01:20:12,138
It's over here, by that old boat.

838
01:20:13,242 --> 01:20:15,904
So you and Suzie used to
come out here together?

839
01:20:16,078 --> 01:20:17,978
Yeah, sometimes.

840
01:20:18,147 --> 01:20:20,581
A lot of the kids hang out here.

841
01:20:22,185 --> 01:20:24,915
You really think something bad
happened to Suzie?

842
01:20:25,454 --> 01:20:27,649
Lombardo ever come out here?

843
01:20:29,926 --> 01:20:31,655
I say something funny?

844
01:20:31,828 --> 01:20:36,026
No, but I mean, just the idea
that Mr. Lombardo would...

845
01:20:36,199 --> 01:20:39,760
Well, the way I heard it,
he was pretty tight with the kids.

846
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:41,460
You and him were pals, right?

847
01:20:41,637 --> 01:20:44,902
Yeah, but he got me
onto the sailing team.

848
01:20:45,074 --> 01:20:48,043
Told me I could work my way
through college, like he did.

849
01:20:48,211 --> 01:20:52,113
Sam Lombardo went to the University
of Miami on an athletic scholarship.

850
01:20:52,281 --> 01:20:56,240
Boats didn't have a damn thing
to do with it.

851
01:21:46,802 --> 01:21:48,793
Listen, I'm gonna be here a while, kid.

852
01:21:48,971 --> 01:21:51,804
Why don't you go up to the highway
and catch the bus?

853
01:21:57,647 --> 01:21:59,274
Hey, Jimmy.

854
01:22:01,484 --> 01:22:05,921
People aren't always what they
appear to be. Don't forget that.

855
01:22:23,372 --> 01:22:25,670
- This is where they did it.
- Where's the body?

856
01:22:25,841 --> 01:22:27,934
The swamp, most likely.
Guy's a swamp rat.

857
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:30,601
He knows it won't be found,
but he made a mistake.

858
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:34,580
She'd been threatening to run away
and I found the car at the bus terminal.

859
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:36,445
You don't think Sam put it there?

860
01:22:36,619 --> 01:22:39,850
Hold on a second.
Gloria, have the car dusted for prints.

861
01:22:40,022 --> 01:22:43,423
And if Suzie even was murdered,
it was that damn Van Ryan kid.

862
01:22:43,592 --> 01:22:45,787
Little sociopath's the one
who started this.

863
01:22:45,962 --> 01:22:49,022
- How long till we get something?
- We can get blood type now.

864
01:22:49,198 --> 01:22:52,690
Dental records will take longer.
DNA could take weeks.

865
01:22:54,303 --> 01:22:56,294
Poor, dumb Suzie.
Kid never had a chance.

866
01:22:56,472 --> 01:22:59,134
- We don't know that.
- I'm telling you, Kelly's next.

867
01:22:59,308 --> 01:23:03,108
I'm telling you, you get
off this right now.

868
01:23:03,379 --> 01:23:07,543
Don't even fucking let me hear
about you bothering Lombardo.

869
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:12,510
David!

870
01:23:12,688 --> 01:23:15,054
You get an ID, you call me!

871
01:23:17,426 --> 01:23:18,654
Will you do me a favor?

872
01:23:19,862 --> 01:23:21,454
Ray, you heard him.

873
01:23:21,630 --> 01:23:24,599
He told me to stay away.
He didn't say anything about you.

874
01:23:24,767 --> 01:23:27,258
What if I'm right and Hunter's wrong?

875
01:23:27,436 --> 01:23:29,904
Please, you gotta help me out
on this, partner.

876
01:23:30,306 --> 01:23:33,605
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's,
you'll give this up?

877
01:23:34,877 --> 01:23:38,779
If I'm wrong about those teeth,
you got my word.

878
01:24:22,224 --> 01:24:24,954
- Hello?
- I've been calling you.

879
01:24:25,127 --> 01:24:26,924
- I wanna see you.
- Where are you?

880
01:24:27,096 --> 01:24:29,758
- The stupid guest house.
- Good. Stay there.

881
01:24:29,932 --> 01:24:31,729
Sam, I'm really nervous.

882
01:24:32,234 --> 01:24:34,498
Kelly, relax.

883
01:24:34,804 --> 01:24:37,272
Take one of your mom's
Valiums or something.

884
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:41,137
In a week, you get on the plane,
this is over. We're rich.

885
01:24:41,310 --> 01:24:43,437
But what if they find out?

886
01:24:43,746 --> 01:24:46,476
My God, they'd put you
in the electric chair.

887
01:24:46,649 --> 01:24:48,082
Look, Kelly...

888
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:51,151
...stay in the guest house,
skip the graduation parties.

889
01:24:51,587 --> 01:24:53,851
I love you so much.

890
01:24:54,023 --> 01:24:55,991
And I love you too, Kelly.

891
01:24:56,158 --> 01:24:58,126
Be a good girl
and stay where you are.

892
01:25:21,283 --> 01:25:23,774
Peeping in people's windows?

893
01:25:24,453 --> 01:25:25,886
Isn't that against the law?

894
01:25:27,756 --> 01:25:29,519
Suzie Toller's missing.

895
01:25:30,593 --> 01:25:33,221
- Since when?
- She didn't come home last night.

896
01:25:33,562 --> 01:25:36,360
We found her car
at the bus terminal.

897
01:25:36,632 --> 01:25:38,327
Ray thinks she was murdered.

898
01:25:39,068 --> 01:25:41,195
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

899
01:25:42,938 --> 01:25:45,805
You could tell me
where you were last night.

900
01:25:46,308 --> 01:25:49,573
I suppose I could,
but I don't really have to, now, do I?

901
01:25:52,681 --> 01:25:53,909
Come here.

902
01:25:55,251 --> 01:25:57,378
I wanna show you something.

903
01:26:08,631 --> 01:26:10,690
Looks like goodbye.

904
01:26:11,367 --> 01:26:13,130
Kelly's file.

905
01:26:13,369 --> 01:26:17,135
Read it. You're gonna find an angry,
sexually confused girl...

906
01:26:17,306 --> 01:26:19,831
...who threatened the lives
of at least two people.

907
01:26:20,009 --> 01:26:21,442
What two people?

908
01:26:21,610 --> 01:26:23,805
One of them was her mother.

909
01:26:24,046 --> 01:26:26,037
The other one was...

910
01:26:27,416 --> 01:26:28,940
...a female classmate...

911
01:26:30,553 --> 01:26:33,215
...she may have been
sexually involved with.

912
01:26:34,323 --> 01:26:35,847
Suzie?

913
01:26:37,526 --> 01:26:39,494
Now you got the file.

914
01:26:39,995 --> 01:26:41,428
Read it.

915
01:26:42,264 --> 01:26:45,427
I think it'll give you a new
perspective on things.

916
01:26:46,569 --> 01:26:49,936
Why didn't you tell us about this
before the trial?

917
01:26:51,974 --> 01:26:54,772
Because then I had principles.

918
01:26:54,944 --> 01:26:56,775
That meant a lot to me.

919
01:26:58,814 --> 01:27:00,247
Now...

920
01:27:01,717 --> 01:27:03,651
...I don't care.

921
01:27:17,733 --> 01:27:19,997
I should probably go now.

922
01:27:22,638 --> 01:27:25,607
Unless you're planning
on holding me for something.

923
01:27:53,068 --> 01:27:56,060
- Duquette. What's happening?
- I'm tired. I'm going home.

924
01:27:56,238 --> 01:27:57,728
- Where's Lombardo?
- He's gone.

925
01:27:57,906 --> 01:28:01,103
Goddamn it, Gloria, the blood type
on the rocks matches Suzie's.

926
01:28:01,277 --> 01:28:03,336
Let me tell you something, Ray:

927
01:28:03,512 --> 01:28:05,537
There's more to this story
than you know.

928
01:28:05,714 --> 01:28:07,272
If Suzie is dead...

929
01:28:07,449 --> 01:28:09,883
...Hunter may be on
the right track about Kelly.

930
01:28:12,087 --> 01:28:13,611
Ray?

931
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:17,224
Shit, Ray.

932
01:28:26,535 --> 01:28:29,663
- Who is it?
- It's Detective Duquette.

933
01:28:29,838 --> 01:28:31,703
Open the gate, now.

934
01:29:03,072 --> 01:29:05,233
- Hello, Kelly.
- What are you doing here?

935
01:29:23,525 --> 01:29:26,961
Where's...? Kelly! Kelly!

936
01:29:34,536 --> 01:29:38,302
I just looked away for a second,
just a split second.

937
01:29:38,607 --> 01:29:41,405
And just like that, bingo...

938
01:29:41,744 --> 01:29:43,939
...she put a knee in my groin.

939
01:29:44,113 --> 01:29:46,911
I didn't go down,
but it slowed me down...

940
01:29:47,416 --> 01:29:49,145
...just enough.

941
01:29:49,718 --> 01:29:51,743
I couldn't get to her.

942
01:29:52,588 --> 01:29:54,613
She turned on me with the gun.

943
01:29:56,759 --> 01:29:58,920
Fired one shot.

944
01:29:59,928 --> 01:30:01,555
I took the hit in the shoulder.

945
01:30:04,933 --> 01:30:06,867
I had no choice.

946
01:30:10,739 --> 01:30:12,070
I had to return fire.

947
01:30:13,809 --> 01:30:17,404
Two rounds, I think,
in the chest.

948
01:30:21,150 --> 01:30:23,414
I went there to protect her.

949
01:30:26,255 --> 01:30:28,815
I went... I went there to protect her.

950
01:30:28,991 --> 01:30:30,720
Detective Duquette.

951
01:30:30,893 --> 01:30:34,420
I spent time in military intelligence,
and we had a saying there:

952
01:30:34,596 --> 01:30:37,861
"Once is happenstance.
Twice is coincidence.

953
01:30:38,033 --> 01:30:40,126
Three times is enemy action."

954
01:30:40,302 --> 01:30:42,327
This is twice for you, Duquette...

955
01:30:42,504 --> 01:30:45,803
...and I intend to see to it
that there is no third time.

956
01:30:46,275 --> 01:30:50,143
Our investigation finds that this was
a good shooting, but that's irrelevant.

957
01:30:50,312 --> 01:30:53,042
You ignored the advice
of your superiors.

958
01:30:53,215 --> 01:30:56,082
Consequently,
two young women are dead.

959
01:30:56,685 --> 01:31:00,746
You are, as of now, terminated,
with forfeiture of pension and benefits.

960
01:31:00,923 --> 01:31:02,584
Chief Goodsall...

961
01:31:02,758 --> 01:31:06,990
...Detective Duquette found
Susan Marie Toller's teeth and blood...

962
01:31:07,162 --> 01:31:09,630
...near the area known as
Stoner Beach.

963
01:31:09,798 --> 01:31:13,029
Miss Toller's blood was also found
in the Van Ryan Range Rover.

964
01:31:13,202 --> 01:31:16,194
This has led this office to conclude...

965
01:31:16,538 --> 01:31:19,996
...that Susan Marie Toller was
murdered by Kelly Lanier Van Ryan.

966
01:31:21,176 --> 01:31:23,508
She...
She didn't.

967
01:31:25,948 --> 01:31:27,643
Mr. Duquette.

968
01:31:28,116 --> 01:31:29,777
Mr. Duquette.

969
01:31:30,219 --> 01:31:33,848
This investigation is concluded.
You're dismissed.

970
01:32:00,215 --> 01:32:01,944
Thank you, Paul.

971
01:32:56,705 --> 01:32:57,933
Howdy, partner.

972
01:32:59,841 --> 01:33:03,709
Jesus, man. I wasn't expecting you
until tomorrow.

973
01:33:07,449 --> 01:33:09,349
Hey, nice girlfriend you got there.

974
01:33:09,518 --> 01:33:12,009
Kelly was only supposed to be framed.

975
01:33:12,187 --> 01:33:14,087
The bitch shot me.

976
01:33:14,256 --> 01:33:17,748
Shit, you're a cop.
Don't they teach you to disarm people?

977
01:33:17,926 --> 01:33:20,417
You know, shoot them
in the leg or something?

978
01:33:20,596 --> 01:33:23,929
Did you become squeamish
about this stuff before or after...

979
01:33:24,099 --> 01:33:27,330
...you bludgeoned little Suzie
to death with a wine bottle?

980
01:33:27,502 --> 01:33:30,960
Kelly wasn't supposed to die, Ray.
It wasn't part of the plan.

981
01:33:31,139 --> 01:33:35,633
It couldn't have worked out better.
They're convinced Kelly killed Suzie.

982
01:33:35,811 --> 01:33:37,642
I couldn't talk them out of it.

983
01:33:37,813 --> 01:33:39,804
I'm telling you,
I don't like surprises.

984
01:33:40,015 --> 01:33:43,951
Look at it this way:
Every cloud has a silver lining.

985
01:33:44,119 --> 01:33:46,053
Now there's no loose ends.

986
01:33:46,221 --> 01:33:49,713
Come tomorrow,
you'll never see me again.

987
01:33:49,891 --> 01:33:53,383
Oh, listen, about tomorrow...

988
01:33:53,829 --> 01:33:57,526
...I spoke to the bank and they said
it's gonna take two working days...

989
01:33:58,734 --> 01:34:00,531
...to make the transfer, so...

990
01:34:00,702 --> 01:34:02,226
- Bullshit.
- Oh, yeah.

991
01:34:02,404 --> 01:34:04,099
Call them yourself.

992
01:34:04,506 --> 01:34:08,602
Anyway, what's your hurry?
Kick back for a day or two.

993
01:34:08,777 --> 01:34:12,804
We'll take out the boat.
I just had it outfitted.

994
01:34:13,382 --> 01:34:15,247
I could use a deck hand.

995
01:34:20,689 --> 01:34:23,157
Here's to large bank accounts.

996
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:29,052
You gotta lighten up, partner.
You're a rich man.

997
01:34:32,367 --> 01:34:35,530
To large accounts
and no loose ends.

998
01:34:36,438 --> 01:34:38,303
And no loose ends.

999
01:34:56,692 --> 01:34:59,593
Hey, Ray, you see that winch?

1000
01:35:01,096 --> 01:35:03,360
Take a couple turns on it.
She's luffing.

1001
01:35:08,103 --> 01:35:09,764
- You mean that thing?
- Yeah, Ray.

1002
01:35:09,938 --> 01:35:14,068
We call it a winch.
It's what we use to tighten the sails.

1003
01:35:14,242 --> 01:35:18,372
- So why don't you start cranking?
- This is supposed to be a vacation.

1004
01:35:18,547 --> 01:35:20,538
Why don't you get a nice powerboat?

1005
01:35:21,216 --> 01:35:23,878
Come on, Ray.
I'll make a sailor out of you yet.

1006
01:35:24,820 --> 01:35:26,651
Or get me drowned.

1007
01:35:40,769 --> 01:35:41,997
It's stuck.

1008
01:35:42,170 --> 01:35:45,401
What do you mean, it's stuck?
Put a little elbow grease in it.

1009
01:35:49,678 --> 01:35:51,270
It's stuck, I'm telling you.

1010
01:35:53,148 --> 01:35:55,412
The jenny sheet must be
caught on something.

1011
01:35:55,584 --> 01:35:58,849
Why don't you go starboard
and see if you can unhook it?

1012
01:35:59,020 --> 01:36:02,512
- I don't understand a word you said.
- Okay, Ray.

1013
01:36:02,691 --> 01:36:05,660
You see this line right here?
Follow it down...

1014
01:36:05,827 --> 01:36:08,455
...and see if you can see
what it's snagged on.

1015
01:36:10,232 --> 01:36:11,790
You're killing me.

1016
01:36:20,542 --> 01:36:24,501
- You mean this thing?
- That's it. That one right there.

1017
01:36:24,913 --> 01:36:26,904
You see anything?

1018
01:36:29,851 --> 01:36:31,716
Look a little lower.

1019
01:36:31,987 --> 01:36:33,215
That's it.

1020
01:36:42,297 --> 01:36:44,822
Guess I forgot to tell you, Ray:

1021
01:36:46,535 --> 01:36:49,026
One hand for the boat,
the other one for yourself.

1022
01:36:49,437 --> 01:36:51,564
First rule of sailing.

1023
01:37:16,865 --> 01:37:18,127
Ray!

1024
01:37:18,300 --> 01:37:20,928
- What happened?
- Nice try, motherfucker!

1025
01:37:30,078 --> 01:37:31,705
You!

1026
01:37:32,347 --> 01:37:34,338
You're dead!

1027
01:37:34,549 --> 01:37:36,016
No, I'm not.

1028
01:37:38,687 --> 01:37:40,120
Sam.

1029
01:37:40,288 --> 01:37:43,780
- Sam, for chrissake!
- Sorry, partner.

1030
01:37:43,959 --> 01:37:46,519
You really shouldn't have killed Kelly.

1031
01:37:46,695 --> 01:37:50,062
You shouldn't have killed that kid
out in the glades either.

1032
01:37:50,232 --> 01:37:53,065
- What was his name?
- Davy.

1033
01:38:06,214 --> 01:38:07,841
That's my son, Walter.

1034
01:38:08,016 --> 01:38:13,113
He's been doing this a long time,
so don't be afraid. Please, come on in.

1035
01:38:13,288 --> 01:38:16,689
Thank you so much
for coming down to the glades.

1036
01:38:29,671 --> 01:38:34,574
Did you come here to watch Walter,
or is this an official visit?

1037
01:38:34,843 --> 01:38:37,004
No. Actually, it's my day off.

1038
01:38:38,847 --> 01:38:40,576
I thought you looked different.

1039
01:38:40,749 --> 01:38:43,309
I came because I was hoping
you would talk to me.

1040
01:38:44,853 --> 01:38:46,150
About Suzie?

1041
01:38:46,321 --> 01:38:50,087
Actually, I was wondering if you would
talk to me about Ray Duquette.

1042
01:38:55,530 --> 01:38:58,055
He used to come around here.

1043
01:38:58,900 --> 01:39:02,267
He had a thing going
with one of the girls...

1044
01:39:02,437 --> 01:39:05,998
Girls. Over at the glades.

1045
01:39:06,841 --> 01:39:10,436
Got sort of hung up on her,
from what I hear.

1046
01:39:11,179 --> 01:39:14,910
- She still work there?
- Not after that night.

1047
01:39:15,483 --> 01:39:17,644
All I know is, the next morning...

1048
01:39:17,819 --> 01:39:21,755
...she was gone and a boy was dead.

1049
01:39:21,923 --> 01:39:27,361
Seminole kid named Davy.
He had a crush on Ray's whore.

1050
01:39:30,732 --> 01:39:34,998
Caught Ray slapping her around,
and he tried to stop it.

1051
01:39:36,004 --> 01:39:38,871
So Ray killed him.

1052
01:39:39,641 --> 01:39:41,871
Suzie saw it.

1053
01:39:42,210 --> 01:39:46,078
So he busted her and sent her up.

1054
01:39:46,247 --> 01:39:50,911
You know, just to prove that he could.

1055
01:39:51,653 --> 01:39:54,713
That's all there is to say
about Ray Duquette.

1056
01:40:05,867 --> 01:40:07,835
To Ray.

1057
01:40:08,203 --> 01:40:11,832
We won. Sam, it's over.

1058
01:40:19,314 --> 01:40:23,648
Wow. Talk about paranoid.
Take a look around us, Sam.

1059
01:40:23,818 --> 01:40:28,016
You're gonna have to teach me how to
drive this before I can get rid of you.

1060
01:40:39,667 --> 01:40:41,066
Okay, Toller.

1061
01:40:41,236 --> 01:40:43,966
I wanna trim the sail.
Grab a hold of that winch.

1062
01:40:44,873 --> 01:40:48,741
- Fuck the winch. I wanna drive.
- It doesn't work that way.

1063
01:40:48,910 --> 01:40:51,037
You don't drive it, you sail it.

1064
01:40:52,047 --> 01:40:54,242
Now, get on that winch.

1065
01:40:55,383 --> 01:40:58,284
I just wanna cruise for a while.

1066
01:41:01,890 --> 01:41:06,486
That's funny. That's one of the first
things I noticed about you, Sam.

1067
01:41:06,661 --> 01:41:09,562
You like to cruise.

1068
01:41:11,199 --> 01:41:15,067
- Suzie.
- Take college, for instance.

1069
01:41:15,236 --> 01:41:20,230
I bet the classes you took were ones
where the finals were multiple choice.

1070
01:41:21,009 --> 01:41:24,672
And you never bought the book.
You'd find a girl to loan you hers.

1071
01:41:24,846 --> 01:41:28,577
And then, of course, you'd have
to fuck her after that, right?

1072
01:41:28,750 --> 01:41:30,240
Is that how it went?

1073
01:41:33,221 --> 01:41:34,688
Yeah.

1074
01:41:37,058 --> 01:41:39,891
Well, I've got a good pop quiz for you.

1075
01:41:40,061 --> 01:41:42,154
Multiple choice, of course.

1076
01:41:43,498 --> 01:41:45,159
Before sailing on the Helios...

1077
01:41:45,333 --> 01:41:50,930
...Medea killed King Creon
and the princess with what?

1078
01:41:51,406 --> 01:41:53,033
A rock?

1079
01:41:53,942 --> 01:41:55,671
A spear gun?

1080
01:41:57,712 --> 01:41:59,270
Or a little poison?

1081
01:42:00,148 --> 01:42:02,241
Poison!

1082
01:42:06,054 --> 01:42:07,612
Good guess.

1083
01:42:21,769 --> 01:42:23,498
Van Ryan got old.

1084
01:42:24,105 --> 01:42:26,630
He and his cronies would come here.

1085
01:42:26,808 --> 01:42:30,904
Hunt and whore.
They acted like a bunch of assholes.

1086
01:42:31,279 --> 01:42:33,873
One trip, he showed up with this girl...

1087
01:42:34,048 --> 01:42:37,313
...he'd picked up somewhere.

1088
01:42:37,485 --> 01:42:39,578
Gotten her pregnant.

1089
01:42:40,622 --> 01:42:42,954
Dumped her in the swamp.

1090
01:42:43,291 --> 01:42:45,259
Poor girl was dead in a year.

1091
01:42:48,696 --> 01:42:52,530
That came with her.

1092
01:42:53,134 --> 01:42:54,897
And the child?

1093
01:42:55,069 --> 01:42:58,698
Well, she had it.
Before she drank herself to death.

1094
01:43:00,241 --> 01:43:03,233
Wasn't exactly a love child.

1095
01:43:14,355 --> 01:43:16,915
So you're not her grandmother.

1096
01:43:18,026 --> 01:43:21,086
I raised her like I was.

1097
01:43:21,629 --> 01:43:25,861
But, no. Walt was my only child.
He was a good boy.

1098
01:43:26,034 --> 01:43:28,195
Until the Army took him.

1099
01:43:28,369 --> 01:43:31,930
So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan
were half sisters.

1100
01:43:32,473 --> 01:43:36,842
And the other girl, Kelly?
Suzie's niece.

1101
01:43:47,555 --> 01:43:51,582
Well, it may be good news or not.
I don't know. We'll start with the letter.

1102
01:43:51,759 --> 01:43:55,251
- H.
- Yes, there are two H's.

1103
01:44:18,653 --> 01:44:20,518
Nice truck.

1104
01:44:28,496 --> 01:44:30,259
Selling your boat?

1105
01:44:35,336 --> 01:44:37,634
This was Suzie's boat.

1106
01:44:38,306 --> 01:44:40,797
Guess she won't be needing it now.

1107
01:44:42,610 --> 01:44:46,671
Funny. I wouldn't have guessed
Suzie was a sailor.

1108
01:44:49,050 --> 01:44:53,214
Old lady had her tested once.
They said her IQ was way up there.

1109
01:44:53,388 --> 01:44:57,256
Around 200 or some such shit.

1110
01:44:57,425 --> 01:45:00,917
That girl could do just about
anything she put her mind to.

1111
01:46:12,633 --> 01:46:14,328
Hi.

1112
01:46:15,036 --> 01:46:16,901
What are you doing out here?

1113
01:46:17,839 --> 01:46:20,103
I'm running away.

1114
01:46:20,908 --> 01:46:23,069
You think that's wise?

1115
01:46:25,913 --> 01:46:28,245
Guess what else?

1116
01:46:31,285 --> 01:46:33,253
I have toys.

1117
01:46:38,292 --> 01:46:40,419
I suppose one taste won't hurt.

1118
01:46:51,906 --> 01:46:53,430
You know...

1119
01:46:53,608 --> 01:46:57,100
...that weekend I got busted,
I called you about a hundred times.

1120
01:47:01,783 --> 01:47:05,719
I really believed that stuff
about you being my friend.

1121
01:47:08,055 --> 01:47:09,352
Was I naive.

1122
01:47:13,861 --> 01:47:15,920
I can't decide what came out better.

1123
01:47:16,097 --> 01:47:21,467
That little straw up Kelly's nose
or that dildo shoved up her ass.

1124
01:47:22,637 --> 01:47:25,128
What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?

1125
01:47:39,454 --> 01:47:41,888
Seems to like the same places you do.

1126
01:47:42,423 --> 01:47:46,985
- Funny you never met.
- Yeah, real funny.

1127
01:47:47,161 --> 01:47:51,621
You know, you're wrong about this,
and I could get busted on the spot.

1128
01:47:52,600 --> 01:47:57,264
Trust me. The guy's dirty. He'll love it.
Especially the part about killing me.

1129
01:47:57,438 --> 01:48:00,896
Now, get out of here.
Go make yourself a new friend.

1130
01:48:13,154 --> 01:48:15,315
What are you drinking?

1131
01:48:19,393 --> 01:48:22,157
We gotta stop. I'm gonna come.

1132
01:48:24,198 --> 01:48:27,429
That never seemed
to worry you at the glades.

1133
01:48:29,003 --> 01:48:34,168
- That's not your line...
- Say you love me.

1134
01:48:35,743 --> 01:48:39,839
I love you.
Now, give me the line.

1135
01:48:40,014 --> 01:48:43,609
No little girl can ever make me come.

1136
01:48:57,198 --> 01:49:01,294
You got the pressure too tight.
You're gonna crush the evidence.

1137
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:08,502
Oh, for chrissake.

1138
01:49:23,558 --> 01:49:25,958
- Hello, Kelly.
- What are you doing here?

1139
01:50:13,074 --> 01:50:14,974
May I ask you a question, Ms. Toller?

1140
01:50:17,511 --> 01:50:20,674
Did you enjoy being
a guest of the state?

1141
01:50:23,384 --> 01:50:25,249
I hope I never make you mad.

1142
01:50:29,190 --> 01:50:31,852
Cash is just walking-around money.

1143
01:50:32,493 --> 01:50:34,688
The check is the balance
of the numbered account...

1144
01:50:34,862 --> 01:50:37,330
...minus the million we set aside
for Ruby and Walter...

1145
01:50:37,498 --> 01:50:39,159
...less my usual fee.

1146
01:50:41,068 --> 01:50:42,729
Case closed.

1147
01:50:54,915 --> 01:50:56,712
Suzie.

1148
01:50:59,353 --> 01:51:01,344
Be good.
