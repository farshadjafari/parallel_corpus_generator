1
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:33,299
No, no, no. Get... Get...
Back of the line, man.

2
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:36,552
- You're gonna let me in, right?
- No, no, no.

3
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:39,180
I got business to run here. Back of the...

4
00:01:39,348 --> 00:01:41,557
- Yo, Maurice.
- Jack. Jackie Jack.

5
00:01:41,725 --> 00:01:45,646
Jackie Jack. Jackie Jack.
Jack, how you doing?

6
00:01:45,813 --> 00:01:48,022
And Miss Lovely Amber Waves. Mwah.

7
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,399
- Hi, Maurice.
- Como estas?

8
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:52,610
- I've been pissed you haven't been around.
- Uh, we were on vacation.

9
00:01:52,778 --> 00:01:55,614
Don't you ever stay away
from my club that long again, okay?

10
00:01:55,781 --> 00:01:58,408
- You got it.
- And not for nothing, honey...

11
00:01:58,575 --> 00:02:02,703
...but you are the sexiest bitch
in the entire county. I love you.

12
00:02:02,871 --> 00:02:03,956
You're such a charmer.

13
00:02:04,123 --> 00:02:06,332
Listen.
I got your booth set up over there.

14
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:10,378
Some clams, I'm gonna send right over.
Listen, Jack. I'm ready, I'm available.

15
00:02:10,546 --> 00:02:13,048
You put me in a movie, okay?
We're talking box office.

16
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:17,260
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Box office, Jack. Chi-Chi?

17
00:02:17,427 --> 00:02:22,557
Chi-chi, listen. Jack and Amber's table.
Take them over an order of clams. Let's go.

18
00:02:22,724 --> 00:02:25,686
Okay, how's it going here?

19
00:02:25,853 --> 00:02:28,729
Listen, baby. Me and you,
we'll take a picture later on, okay?

20
00:02:28,897 --> 00:02:30,231
I love you, baby.

21
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,610
How's it going? Hey, hey, hey. Yeah.

22
00:02:34,778 --> 00:02:37,948
Hey, we were looking for you before, man.
Where were you, seriously?

23
00:02:38,115 --> 00:02:40,533
- Yeah. Okay, I was here.
- Seriously, man.

24
00:02:40,701 --> 00:02:42,578
Hmm.

25
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:45,956
- I love you.
- I love you, Beck. I love you, Beck.

26
00:02:46,123 --> 00:02:48,457
Hey, Maurice. Hey, cowboy.

27
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,918
- Cow...? That's a cowboy?
- Cowboy.

28
00:02:51,086 --> 00:02:52,587
That's...
There you go.

29
00:02:52,754 --> 00:02:54,381
- You like it? It's nice, right?
- Yeah.

30
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,591
- If you like it, it's okay.
- I love it, man.

31
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,843
- Okay.
- All right.

32
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,263
- Cool. Real cool.
- Thanks, man.

33
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,389
- Compliments of Maurice.
- Oh, thank you.

34
00:03:03,557 --> 00:03:07,060
- Can I get a margarita, please?
- Uh, 7-Up.

35
00:03:10,606 --> 00:03:12,231
- Hi, Rollergirl.
- Hi.

36
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,110
- Did you call that girl today?
- I forgot.

37
00:03:15,277 --> 00:03:19,281
If you don't do it tomorrow, it'll be the
weekend, you'll never be able to see her.

38
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,908
Okay.

39
00:03:21,074 --> 00:03:22,742
What's the matter down there?

40
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:26,454
- I gotta go pee.
- Well, go then.

41
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:37,507
What's happening?

42
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:40,301
Guys, let's get the album.

43
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,886
- Hey, Jack.
- Little Bill.

44
00:04:23,053 --> 00:04:25,346
- Hi.
- Hi, Amber. How are you?

45
00:04:25,514 --> 00:04:28,182
Uh, how's our schedule?
Are we still on for day after tomorrow?

46
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,519
More like the day after
the day after tomorrow.

47
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:34,021
Jack, come on. I gotta call Rocky, Scotty,
Kurt. I gotta call those guys.

48
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:37,526
I wanna keep a small group on this one.
A small crew. Know what I mean?

49
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,403
- A low-key deal?
- Exactly.

50
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:41,196
Well...

51
00:04:41,363 --> 00:04:44,949
I mean, do...? I'm sorry.
Do we...? Do we have a script?

52
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,896
- Hey.
- Hey.

53
00:05:16,064 --> 00:05:18,649
- So how you doing?
- Fine.

54
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:22,571
- How old are you?
- I have a work permit. I have all the papers...

55
00:05:22,738 --> 00:05:25,406
No, it's nothing like that.
You been working here long?

56
00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:27,492
A month.

57
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,745
- Maurice give you the job?
- Yeah.

58
00:05:29,911 --> 00:05:34,124
You from around here?
I mean, uh, Canoga? Reseda?

59
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,918
- Um, no. You know where Torrance is?
- Yeah. How do you get here?

60
00:05:38,086 --> 00:05:40,004
Take the bus.

61
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:43,632
- So, what do you wanna be?
- Excuse me?

62
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,928
Well, I mean, you take the bus from Torrance
to come here to Reseda to do this job.

63
00:05:48,096 --> 00:05:50,598
Can't you get a job like this in Torrance?

64
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:54,853
- Yeah, but I don't want to.
- Oh, okay.

65
00:05:58,106 --> 00:05:59,816
So...

66
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,319
...you want 5 or 10?

67
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,279
What?

68
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:09,076
Well, if you just wanna see me jack off,
it's 10.

69
00:06:09,242 --> 00:06:12,286
But if you just wanna look at it,
it's only 5.

70
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:16,040
- Guys pay you to watch you, do they?
- Yeah.

71
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,959
- You already done it tonight?
- Couple times.

72
00:06:19,127 --> 00:06:22,798
- And you can do it again?
- If you want. If you got 10 bucks.

73
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,966
No.

74
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:27,636
My name is Jack.

75
00:06:28,303 --> 00:06:29,678
Eddie. Eddie Adams.

76
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,973
- Eddie Adams from Torrance.
- Yup.

77
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,310
- Jack Horner, filmmaker.
- Really?

78
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:39,980
Yeah. I make, uh, adult films,
exotic pictures.

79
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:43,026
Ah, I know who you are.
I read about you in a magazine.

80
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,194
Inside Amber, Amanda's Ride.
You made those.

81
00:06:45,362 --> 00:06:46,696
- Right.
- Those are great.

82
00:06:46,863 --> 00:06:48,656
So now you know...

83
00:06:48,824 --> 00:06:50,699
- ...I'm not full of doggy doo-doo.
- Heh, yeah.

84
00:06:50,867 --> 00:06:53,745
Wanna come back to the table
and, uh, you know, have a drink with me?

85
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,581
Uh, I'd love to, but I gotta work.

86
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,334
You have to work, get money,
you know, pay the rent.

87
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:01,461
Well, yea... I mean, no.

88
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,255
I need money, but I don't pay rent.
I still live at home.

89
00:07:05,841 --> 00:07:07,259
How old are you, Eddie?

90
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,511
Seventeen.

91
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,223
Seventeen-year-old piece of gold.

92
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,725
- Heh, yeah, right.
- Why don't you come to the table?

93
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:19,396
- I got some people I'd like you to meet.
- I do know you. I know who you are.

94
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:23,024
I'd love to come to your table for a drink.
Obviously, you're not full of, um...

95
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,358
- Doggy doo-doo.
- Yeah.

96
00:07:24,776 --> 00:07:28,237
But I just couldn't walk out on Maurice.
I'm really sorry.

97
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,615
Yeah.

98
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:35,286
I got a feeling, beneath those jeans there's
something wonderful just waiting to get out.

99
00:07:48,216 --> 00:07:49,718
- Hey, guys.
- Bill. What's up?

100
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:53,762
- Not a lot. What are you guys up to?
- Don't know, probably just go home.

101
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,600
- I'll see you guys later.
- What are you still doing here?

102
00:07:56,766 --> 00:07:59,269
- Can I sleep at your place?
- Half-hour, I'll be there.

103
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,437
- Bye, Maurice.
- Good night.

104
00:08:01,605 --> 00:08:03,648
Hey, listen. Thank you.

105
00:08:03,815 --> 00:08:05,233
Love you, mamita. Take care.

106
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:08,110
This is the man that you let in anytime,
you understand?

107
00:08:08,278 --> 00:08:10,237
- Ha, ha.
- All right.

108
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:13,742
- Luego.
- Hasta manana.

109
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,749
Fix you some eggs, beauty?

110
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,959
No. I'm going to sleep. Good night.

111
00:08:24,127 --> 00:08:26,922
Good night, honey-tits. Sleep beautiful.

112
00:08:27,088 --> 00:08:28,589
Okay.

113
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,335
Tom? Hi. Yeah, it's me.

114
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,879
I know that it's late, but I...

115
00:09:08,129 --> 00:09:10,340
Is Andy there? Is he?

116
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,009
I'd like to say hello.

117
00:09:14,177 --> 00:09:18,056
I'd like to say hello to my son,
and that's all.

118
00:09:22,894 --> 00:09:24,104
Let me tell you something.

119
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:27,691
Let me tell you something you don't know.
I know a lawyer. You understand?

120
00:09:27,857 --> 00:09:31,986
You might think I don't, but I do,
and I'll take you to court.

121
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:40,995
Tom, don't. Come on, Tom.
Please. Please. Please.

122
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,222
What the fuck are you doing?

123
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,061
What the fuck does it look like I'm doing?

124
00:10:46,227 --> 00:10:47,394
Can you close the door?

125
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,815
Will I close the door?

126
00:10:50,982 --> 00:10:54,152
Will I close the door?
That's my wife, you asshole.

127
00:10:55,403 --> 00:10:57,572
Uh, I'm sorry.

128
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,326
Get out. Go sleep on the couch.

129
00:11:01,951 --> 00:11:03,952
Don't stop, big stud.

130
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,842
Yeah. That's right.

131
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,504
Oh, Jesus, please, okay?
Shave if you're gonna do that.

132
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:20,881
- You scratch my face.
- Sorry.

133
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,432
- Good morning.
- Hey.

134
00:13:32,602 --> 00:13:36,272
How's it at work?
You get home late, huh?

135
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,234
- Yeah.
- You know, you work in a nightclub.

136
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,236
If it means so much to you,
you should find one that's closer.

137
00:13:42,403 --> 00:13:43,446
Yeah.

138
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,075
I gotta get to work.

139
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,451
- At a car wash.
- What?

140
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,913
You work at a car wash.
You work at a nightclub.

141
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,081
School never occurred to you?

142
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,886
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

143
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:14,601
So basically, you're getting
twice the bass with the TK-421...

144
00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:17,312
...which we've, uh, got available
in this system right here.

145
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:21,442
I don't know. I don't really
know if I need all that bass.

146
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,945
Oh, I think you need all that bass.

147
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,614
Heh, I mean, if you want a system
to handle what you want...

148
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,116
...yeah, you need the bass.

149
00:14:29,534 --> 00:14:33,288
See, this... This is hi-fi, okay?

150
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:36,249
High fidelity. Know what that means?

151
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,460
That means
this is the highest quality fidelity.

152
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:43,423
Hi-fi. Those are two very important things
to have in a stereo system.

153
00:14:44,048 --> 00:14:47,844
- It's the price. For the 420...
- I have this very unit in my home.

154
00:14:48,011 --> 00:14:49,803
- Really?
- Yes, I do.

155
00:14:49,971 --> 00:14:52,472
Of course, I got it modified
with the TK-421...

156
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,475
...which, uh, kicks it up another...

157
00:14:54,643 --> 00:15:00,523
...I don't know, maybe three or four, um,
quads per channel, you know.

158
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:04,235
But that's really... That's technical talk.
That doesn't really concern you.

159
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,238
Still a little uncertain, aren't you?

160
00:15:07,405 --> 00:15:08,655
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

161
00:15:08,823 --> 00:15:11,241
You know what you need?
You need a test drive.

162
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:13,410
That's what you need.
You need a test drive.

163
00:15:13,578 --> 00:15:17,874
It's one thing to hear it from Buck's mouth,
it's another to hear it from the TK-421.

164
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,918
So let me just pop in this 8-track...

165
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,461
...and you just give a listen,
tell me what you think, okay?

166
00:15:25,548 --> 00:15:27,591
Whoo. Huh?

167
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:30,886
You hear that? You hear the bass? Right?

168
00:15:31,054 --> 00:15:32,679
You hear it? It kicks.

169
00:15:32,847 --> 00:15:37,809
It turns. It curls up your belly.
Makes you wanna freaky-deaky, right?

170
00:15:37,977 --> 00:15:40,897
Heh, you got that?
Now, see, if you get this system as is...

171
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:44,192
...it's not gonna sound like this
without the TK-421 modification...

172
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,528
...and we do that in the store right here,
very small price.

173
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:50,740
Go on and move with it if you need to.
It helps me.

174
00:15:51,866 --> 00:15:53,368
Thank you for your time.

175
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,578
Oh, okay. Well, hey. So long, partner.

176
00:15:57,956 --> 00:16:00,124
- What the fuck was that?
- What?

177
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,875
- Have I told you?
- Have... What?

178
00:16:02,043 --> 00:16:03,961
- Have I?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

179
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,923
You put on that country-western shit,
no one's gonna buy a stereo.

180
00:16:08,091 --> 00:16:10,677
What kind of brother are you, anyway?
Listening to that shit.

181
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:13,346
- All right. Look, Jerry...
- No, no, no. You look.

182
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,389
I gave you a job here because,
you know...

183
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:19,394
...I thought your acting stuff might bring
some nice pussy into the place, and it has.

184
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:23,563
But I can't have any more fuckups.
You dig?

185
00:16:23,731 --> 00:16:24,774
Yeah.

186
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,775
- You dig?
- Yeah. I dig.

187
00:16:26,943 --> 00:16:30,278
Okay, now get in the back
and, uh, unload those new 484s.

188
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,948
All right. Sorry, I was just...

189
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,909
Settle down, class. Settle down.

190
00:16:37,078 --> 00:16:38,620
This is your final.

191
00:16:38,788 --> 00:16:42,582
Keep your test papers face down
until I tell you to turn them up.

192
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,419
Clear your tables, please.

193
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:49,673
There should be nothing on your desk
but your test paper and a pencil.

194
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:54,386
We're covering chapters 17 through 28.

195
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:58,765
Your eyes should stay on your test paper,
please.

196
00:16:58,933 --> 00:17:00,976
Are we ready?

197
00:17:01,144 --> 00:17:03,479
Class, begin.

198
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:34,218
I love to suck cock. I love to suck cock.

199
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:51,152
Honey? You okay?
Sweetheart? Ls something wrong?

200
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,990
- I gotta get back.
- I need it once more.

201
00:17:56,157 --> 00:17:59,160
- I have to go back to work.
- Come on. Give it to me, Eddie.

202
00:17:59,327 --> 00:18:01,162
Don't make me pounce you, Sheryl Lynn.

203
00:18:01,329 --> 00:18:03,247
- Ooh, baby, baby, baby.
- I'll do it.

204
00:18:03,414 --> 00:18:05,791
- You promise?
- Oh, that's it.

205
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,417
- You want it?
- Yeah.

206
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,170
- How bad?
- Bad.

207
00:18:09,337 --> 00:18:11,005
- You sure?
- Yeah.

208
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,173
You asked for it.

209
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:18,346
Oh, God. Wait.

210
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,557
Stop. Stop.

211
00:18:23,184 --> 00:18:24,352
What?

212
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,234
Your cock is so beautiful.

213
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,153
Yeah?

214
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,030
Do you know how good you are
at doing it, Eddie?

215
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:40,992
Having sex? Fucking me?
Making love to me?

216
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,288
Everyone has one thing, you think?

217
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,959
I mean, everyone's given
one special thing, right?

218
00:18:48,126 --> 00:18:49,961
That's right.

219
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,589
Everyone's blessed
with one special thing.

220
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,260
Hey.

221
00:19:00,721 --> 00:19:03,766
I want you to know I plan on being a star.

222
00:19:03,933 --> 00:19:06,394
A big, bright shining star.

223
00:19:06,894 --> 00:19:10,272
That's what I want.
That's what I'm gonna get.

224
00:19:10,606 --> 00:19:12,191
I know.

225
00:19:12,358 --> 00:19:14,152
I gotta go.

226
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,445
You're lucky.

227
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,402
Hi.

228
00:20:37,818 --> 00:20:39,319
- Eddie.
- Hi.

229
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,820
- Want a ride?
- Jack?

230
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:44,659
- Yeah. Want a ride?
- Hi. Uh, well, I'm going really far.

231
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:47,244
Do you remember me
from a couple hours ago?

232
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,413
Yeah, I remember.

233
00:20:50,289 --> 00:20:52,540
Come with us, sweetie.

234
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,585
Okay.

235
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:02,550
This is a really cool car, Jack.

236
00:21:07,723 --> 00:21:10,183
So, what I'm trying to tell you, Eddie...

237
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:15,314
...is that it takes a lot
of the good, old American green stuff...

238
00:21:15,481 --> 00:21:18,483
...to make one of these things,
you know what I mean?

239
00:21:18,734 --> 00:21:22,529
I mean, you know, you've got your camera,
you've got your film...

240
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,907
...you got your lights, you got your sound,
you got your lab costs...

241
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:29,412
...you got your developing, you got
your synching, you got your editing.

242
00:21:29,578 --> 00:21:36,294
Before you turn around, you've spent
maybe 20-, 25-, $30,000 on a movie.

243
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,422
- Wow, that's a lot of money.
- You bet your ass it is.

244
00:21:39,588 --> 00:21:41,382
But if you make a good one...

245
00:21:41,549 --> 00:21:44,719
...there's practically no end
to how much money you can make.

246
00:21:44,885 --> 00:21:47,555
- Have you seen Jack's house?
- No.

247
00:21:47,722 --> 00:21:50,849
- He will.
- He'll see it.

248
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:54,185
You got maybe 15, 20 guys
standing around...

249
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:57,940
...just making sure
that your lighting is right.

250
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:01,443
But you can work out in the morning,
you can work out at noon...

251
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,487
...you can work out at night.

252
00:22:03,654 --> 00:22:06,781
It doesn't matter
if you don't have those juices flowing...

253
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:11,746
...down there in the Mr. Torpedo area,
in the fun zone...

254
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,414
...but you gotta get the people
in the theater.

255
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,750
You know, you need the big dicks,
the big tits.

256
00:22:16,917 --> 00:22:19,377
Uh-oh. Here we go.

257
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:23,089
How do you keep them in the theater
after they've come?

258
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:25,509
With beauty...

259
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,804
...and with acting.

260
00:22:29,472 --> 00:22:33,517
Now, I understand you've gotta
get them in the theater, you know?

261
00:22:33,684 --> 00:22:35,102
You gotta keep the seats full.

262
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:39,272
But I don't wanna make a film
where they show up, they sit down...

263
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:42,817
...they jack off, and they get up
and they get out before the story ends.

264
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:48,615
It is my dream, it is my goal,
it is my idea to make a film...

265
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:52,787
...that the story just sucks them in...

266
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:58,125
...and when they spurt out that joy juice,
they just gotta sit in it.

267
00:22:58,292 --> 00:23:04,757
They can't move
until they find out how the story ends.

268
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:09,636
You know, aah,
I wanna make a film like that.

269
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,263
And I understand,
you know, they have to make films...

270
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:15,976
I've made them myself,
you know, that are a few laughs...

271
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:19,521
...everybody fucks their brains out,
and that's fine.

272
00:23:19,772 --> 00:23:23,817
But it's my dream to make a film...

273
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:27,113
...that is true...

274
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:31,951
...and right and dramatic.

275
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,953
You sure you don't want a Fresca?

276
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,538
- No, thanks.
- Are you sure?

277
00:23:36,705 --> 00:23:38,833
- Yeah.
- You're out of limes, Jack.

278
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,751
Well, check in the kitchen, darling.

279
00:23:43,462 --> 00:23:45,506
I'm going to bed.

280
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:48,843
Good night, Jackie.
Don't stay up too late.

281
00:23:49,009 --> 00:23:50,845
Good night, beauty.

282
00:23:51,762 --> 00:23:53,221
- Good night, Eddie.
- Good night.

283
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,432
Glad you came by.

284
00:23:57,352 --> 00:24:00,270
- You're great.
- Oh, thank you.

285
00:24:04,942 --> 00:24:07,027
She's the best.

286
00:24:08,195 --> 00:24:10,239
She's a wonderful mother, you know?

287
00:24:10,406 --> 00:24:13,701
She's a mother
to all those who need love.

288
00:24:13,868 --> 00:24:16,537
- She's really nice.
- Yeah.

289
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:22,835
You know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking,
I wanna be in business with you, Eddie.

290
00:24:23,002 --> 00:24:25,503
- Really?
- Yeah. What do you think?

291
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,548
I'd love it.

292
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,509
What do you think of Rollergirl?

293
00:24:30,676 --> 00:24:33,345
- She's great.
- Yeah.

294
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:36,307
- Would you like to do it?
- Have sex?

295
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:39,977
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah. I mean, I'd love to.

296
00:24:40,144 --> 00:24:43,396
- She's really foxy.
- Oh, you bet your ass she is.

297
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,398
You're officially out of limes, Jack.

298
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:48,067
Well, I'll pick up some for you
tomorrow or something.

299
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:49,361
Come here, darling.

300
00:24:49,528 --> 00:24:53,531
I want you to go over there
and sit on the couch with Eddie.

301
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,617
Here we go. Are we gonna fuck?

302
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:59,704
- Oh, yes.
- Ha, ha. Wait a minute.

303
00:25:12,801 --> 00:25:14,761
- Are you ready?
- Yeah. Are you?

304
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,763
Oh, yeah.

305
00:25:20,684 --> 00:25:22,435
Are you gonna take your skates off

306
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:25,064
I don't take my skates off.

307
00:25:25,231 --> 00:25:27,273
- And don't fucking come in.
- Okay.

308
00:25:28,442 --> 00:25:30,986
Aim it at her tits, Eddie.

309
00:25:55,261 --> 00:25:57,221
- Hi.
- Where were you?

310
00:25:57,388 --> 00:26:00,641
- Nowhere.
- Shut up. Where were you?

311
00:26:00,808 --> 00:26:04,644
You see that little slut girl you see?
Sheryl? Sheryl Lynn?

312
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,564
Don't say that.

313
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:09,983
Make you feel like a stud
to see trash like that?

314
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,820
- She your girlfriend?
- No, she's not my girlfr...

315
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:17,156
She's a little whore
and a little piece of trash.

316
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:19,993
And I know
you're not the only one she sees.

317
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:23,705
- Why would you say something like that?
- I heard things about her, that girl.

318
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:26,458
Don't think I don't know what goes on
when I'm not here.

319
00:26:26,625 --> 00:26:30,503
I wash your sheets. I know she's been here.
Or you doing something else in there...

320
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,839
...with your music
and your posters on the wall?

321
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,175
- What is your problem?
- Okay, fine. All right. Just go.

322
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:39,179
Go to that whore Sheryl Lynn.
Why don't you just go to her?

323
00:26:39,346 --> 00:26:40,847
- Yeah. Well, maybe I will.
- Yeah?

324
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,348
- Yeah.
- What are you gonna do?

325
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:45,769
- I don't know. I'll do something.
- You can't do anything.

326
00:26:45,936 --> 00:26:48,271
You're a loser. You'll always be a loser.

327
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,442
You couldn't even finish high school
because you were so stupid.

328
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:53,736
- So, what are you gonna do?
- I'll do something.

329
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:56,739
I'll go somewhere.
I'll run away where you can never find me.

330
00:26:56,905 --> 00:26:58,615
Go ahead and fuck that little girl.

331
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:04,329
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm getting my stuff.

332
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:08,208
You think that's your stuff. That's not
your stuff. You didn't pay for it.

333
00:27:08,375 --> 00:27:11,586
That is not your stuff
because you didn't pay for it, stupid!

334
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,423
None of this is yours! This...

335
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:18,009
You leave here,
you leave with what you've got!

336
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:21,305
Nothing! Nothing!

337
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:25,142
You understand me?
You want to treat me like this?

338
00:27:25,309 --> 00:27:27,685
- This is what happens, okay?
- I didn't do anything.

339
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:30,105
You want to live that way?
Fuck that little whore!

340
00:27:30,272 --> 00:27:33,400
You think you're gonna be this?
You think you're gonna be this?

341
00:27:33,567 --> 00:27:34,942
Goddamn poster!

342
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:38,029
Don't do that! Don't do that!
Why are you doing that?

343
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,574
You're not gonna be shit
because you're too stupid!

344
00:27:40,741 --> 00:27:42,617
- I'm not stupid!
- Yes, you are!

345
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:46,246
Please, please. Don't fucking do that.
Please don't be mean to me.

346
00:27:46,413 --> 00:27:49,165
I'm not being mean to you.
You're just too stupid to see it.

347
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:53,252
You don't know what I can do,
what I'm gonna do, or what I'm gonna be.

348
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:56,464
You don't know. I'm good.
I have good things you don't know about.

349
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:57,965
I'm gonna be something! I am!

350
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:00,760
- Don't fucking tell me I'm not!
- You can't do anything.

351
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:04,431
Don't be mean!
And you don't talk to me! No!

352
00:28:04,598 --> 00:28:06,349
Fuck.

353
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:19,070
Eddie Adams from Torrance.

354
00:28:19,321 --> 00:28:21,198
I knew you'd make it.

355
00:28:21,365 --> 00:28:24,576
- You take the bus the whole way here?
- Yeah. It wasn't bad, though.

356
00:28:24,743 --> 00:28:26,119
- How are you?
- Oh, great.

357
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,413
I got some people I want you to meet.

358
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,880
- Do you like music?
- I love music.

359
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:40,008
- What kind?
- All kinds of music. Rock, jazz, classical.

360
00:28:40,175 --> 00:28:42,760
Oh, I want you to meet
a couple of great people.

361
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:45,931
- Buck and Becky.
- Hi. I'm Eddie. Eddie Adams.

362
00:28:46,098 --> 00:28:48,808
- Buck Swope. Nice to meet you.
- Our new fella.

363
00:28:49,059 --> 00:28:50,978
- Becky Barnett.
- It's nice to meet you.

364
00:28:51,145 --> 00:28:52,186
Oh, this is the new fella?

365
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:53,521
- Oh, ho.
- Oh, ho.

366
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,315
- Is that a faccia?
- That is a faccia.

367
00:28:55,482 --> 00:28:58,192
- I didn't know you'd be so precious.
- Faccia's "face," right?

368
00:28:58,361 --> 00:28:59,569
- That's right.
- Yeah.

369
00:29:00,946 --> 00:29:03,156
- Nice to meet you, guys.
- All right.

370
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:05,159
- Great people.
- Oh, yeah.

371
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:06,910
He's one hell of an actor.

372
00:29:07,077 --> 00:29:09,747
Hey, Reed. Reed-o.

373
00:29:10,038 --> 00:29:13,959
I want you to meet
the new boy on the street.

374
00:29:14,126 --> 00:29:15,461
Eddie Adams.

375
00:29:15,627 --> 00:29:17,962
- Hi. I'm Eddie.
- Hi, Eddie. Reed Rothchild.

376
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:21,090
- I want you to stick around for a while.
- Sure.

377
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:24,094
- Make him something special.
- Aye, aye.

378
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:27,013
- So you live on this street?
- No, no.

379
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,557
Oh, I thought Jack just said you did.

380
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,351
- No.
- Hmm.

381
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,644
- Want a drink?
- Sure.

382
00:29:32,811 --> 00:29:35,189
- Margarita?
- Great.

383
00:29:35,981 --> 00:29:37,191
Wow.

384
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:44,030
Two, four, mm-hm, whatever.

385
00:29:46,867 --> 00:29:48,743
- Can I ask you something?
- Uh-huh.

386
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,828
- Do you work out?
- Yeah.

387
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:53,373
Yeah. You look like it.
What do you squat?

388
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:56,919
- About two.
- Super, super.

389
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,961
What about you?

390
00:29:59,463 --> 00:30:01,507
What do you squat?

391
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,384
- Three-fifty.
- Wow.

392
00:30:04,551 --> 00:30:06,886
- No B.S.
- That's a lot.

393
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,722
- Where do you work out?
- Ln Torrance, where I live.

394
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,391
Cool. Cool.

395
00:30:11,558 --> 00:30:15,686
Hey, you ever go to Vince's out here?
Oh, no. I would have seen you.

396
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:18,898
- I'm there every day.
- I've always wanted to work out at Vince's.

397
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:22,236
Cool. Here. Taste that.

398
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:28,951
- Ahem, rock 'n' roll.
- Right?

399
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:35,164
- Did you ever see that movie Star Wars?
- Oh, about four times.

400
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:39,211
- People tell me I look like Han Solo.
- Really?

401
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,673
What do you bench?

402
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,217
You tell first.

403
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,219
I asked you first.

404
00:30:47,386 --> 00:30:49,136
Same time.

405
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,721
Cool.

406
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,598
- Are you ready?
- Ready.

407
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:56,394
One, two, three...

408
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,521
- You didn't say anything.
- Oh, neither did you.

409
00:30:59,898 --> 00:31:01,441
Hey, guys. Look at me.

410
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:21,169
Thank you, Johnny.
My dear, it's party time.

411
00:31:21,336 --> 00:31:24,463
Oh, do you look lovely. Mm.

412
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:28,426
- Hello, Colonel. How are you?
- Oh, hello, Jack. Ha-ha-ha.

413
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,596
Hi. This is my lady friend.

414
00:31:30,762 --> 00:31:34,432
Darling, I'd like you to meet Jack Horner,
the finest director in the business.

415
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:35,642
- Hi.
- Hi.

416
00:31:35,809 --> 00:31:37,435
Do you have any coke at this party?

417
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:40,314
- They can find some somewhere. Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.

418
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,481
- Great.
- You're no bigger than a minute?

419
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:43,650
Uh-uh. Ha, ha.

420
00:31:43,817 --> 00:31:45,568
- Shy as a butterfly.
- I'll bet.

421
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:50,073
He has every right to tell me how to sell
stereos. It's his store, I'll listen.

422
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,576
He does not have the right
to tell me how to dress.

423
00:31:52,743 --> 00:31:54,702
Where's he get off
telling me how to dress, huh?

424
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,663
- It's old. It's just plain old.
- No, wait. Let me tell you...

425
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:59,916
He was obviously pissed off
about the music.

426
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:03,252
- What's wrong with it?
- The cowboy look ended six years ago.

427
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:06,673
- It's coming back though, Becky.
- No, it's not. It's over. It's dead, okay?

428
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,842
I don't think you know
what you're talking about.

429
00:32:09,009 --> 00:32:11,010
I do know what I'm talking about.

430
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,846
Your bosses at the stereo store
are saying the same thing.

431
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:17,017
- What? What?
- You have to get a new look.

432
00:32:17,184 --> 00:32:19,019
What? You get a new look.

433
00:32:19,186 --> 00:32:21,480
I have a look, okay?
The look I have is just fine.

434
00:32:21,647 --> 00:32:24,523
- What's your look?
- Chocolate love, all right?

435
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:26,442
- Oh, take a pill.
- One hundred percent.

436
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,237
You don't have to lash out.
I'm trying to be your friend.

437
00:32:29,404 --> 00:32:32,531
- Okay, Becky. Drop it.
- I tried opening up a club there, you know?

438
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,327
But you see, Miss Amber, I'm just this
poor fellow from Puerto Rico, you know?

439
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,372
I got this club. Yeah, that's one thing.

440
00:32:38,538 --> 00:32:41,833
But soon that goes, I die,
then what do I have? I got nothing.

441
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,042
Mm-hm.

442
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,461
You know, I want something
I can send home, you know?

443
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:50,424
Something I can send to my brothers
and say, "Look at me.

444
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:53,886
Look at me and all the beautiful women
I've been with."

445
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,556
So what? You want me to talk to Jack?

446
00:32:56,723 --> 00:33:00,434
Yeah. I mean, you know.
I mean, what am I asking you here?

447
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:02,813
Honey, Amber, baby, please, talk to Jack.

448
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:05,398
Tell him I can do this.
Tell him I won't be bad.

449
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:08,109
- So you wanna be in a movie?
- Baby, please.

450
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:10,528
- I'll see what I can do.
- Would you, love?

451
00:33:10,696 --> 00:33:12,279
Thank you very much.

452
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,490
Thank you, mamita.

453
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:19,788
Maurice, can I talk to you?
I need to talk to you now.

454
00:33:19,955 --> 00:33:22,082
- Now?
- Yeah. We gotta go in here.

455
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,916
- Excuse me.
- Hi.

456
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,086
Can I join in?

457
00:33:26,753 --> 00:33:27,878
Most certainly.

458
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:31,549
- Your cowboy...? That's not dead.
- Then what is Becky talking about?

459
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:34,552
- She's got something up her ass.
- Fuck that shit.

460
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,346
Bitch.

461
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:58,117
- Do a cannonball.
- No, no. Watch this jackknife.

462
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:06,792
- Did it look cool?
- That was pretty good.

463
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:09,086
Let me show you what you did wrong.

464
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,851
Full flip.

465
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,070
Whoa.

466
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:40,827
Ow.

467
00:34:40,994 --> 00:34:43,288
- You all right?
- Yeah.

468
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:46,208
Hey, you gotta bring your legs
all the way around.

469
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:49,126
I know. I know.

470
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:52,047
- Hey, hey, hey. This is my point.
- What?

471
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,048
- Okay, you know what I say?
- What?

472
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,134
Wear what you dig.

473
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:58,887
That's it. Just wear what you dig.

474
00:34:59,054 --> 00:35:02,139
- That's what I said.
- Well, what's the problem?

475
00:35:04,643 --> 00:35:06,686
- Should I get that?
- Yeah.

476
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:10,065
Hello? Uh-huh.

477
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,400
Uh, can you speak a little louder, please?

478
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:15,987
A who? A Ma...? A Maggie.
You know a Maggie?

479
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:19,949
- I don't know a Maggie.
- Uh, look, sorry. There's no Maggie here.

480
00:35:20,367 --> 00:35:24,829
Your... Your mother. Oh, okay.
Just give me a sec.

481
00:35:24,996 --> 00:35:27,331
Watch that for me, okay?

482
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:33,547
Uh, excuse me, is Maggie here?
Maggie? Are you Maggie?

483
00:35:33,713 --> 00:35:37,175
No? Do you know?
Maggie, Maggie, Maggie.

484
00:35:37,342 --> 00:35:39,010
Do you know Maggie?

485
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,472
- Are you Maggie?
- No.

486
00:35:44,057 --> 00:35:46,351
Oh, man. Can you believe this?

487
00:35:46,518 --> 00:35:50,105
Hello? Yeah, listen.
I'm sorry, there's no Maggie here.

488
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:53,817
Okay. No, no. It's not a problem.
Okay. Ciao.

489
00:35:54,693 --> 00:35:58,112
- Who was that?
- Oh, some kid looking for his mom.

490
00:36:46,286 --> 00:36:49,414
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What's it look like they're doing?

491
00:36:49,581 --> 00:36:50,748
That's my wife.

492
00:36:51,291 --> 00:36:54,878
Shut up, Bill. You're embarrassing me.

493
00:36:55,253 --> 00:36:57,713
Yeah, Little Bill. Shut up.

494
00:37:10,143 --> 00:37:12,519
- Little Bill.
- Hey, Kurt. How's it going?

495
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:15,606
- What's wrong with you?
- Oh, my fucking wife, man.

496
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,733
She's down there,
some idiot's dick in her.

497
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:21,153
Everybody's standing around watching.
It's a fucking embarrassment.

498
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,657
Yeah, yeah. I know. Anyway, listen.

499
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:26,159
- Yeah.
- For the shoot, I wanna talk about the look.

500
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,411
- See about getting this new zoom lens.
- Right.

501
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,498
I was wondering if we'd be able
to look into getting more lights.

502
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,041
Jack wants a minimal thing.

503
00:37:33,208 --> 00:37:36,670
Yeah, well, very often minimal means
a lot more photographically, I think...

504
00:37:36,836 --> 00:37:39,505
- Well, I think than most people understand.
- I understand.

505
00:37:39,673 --> 00:37:42,592
No, I know you understand.
I'm talking about some other people.

506
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,262
I think what Jack is talking about
is minimal.

507
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,389
Not really natural, but minimal.

508
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:50,224
- Okay, fine. Uh, I was just saying...
- I understand.

509
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:53,186
Yeah, because I'm trying
to give each picture its own look.

510
00:37:53,353 --> 00:37:56,356
- Can we talk about this later?
- Oh, yeah.

511
00:37:56,523 --> 00:37:58,817
You gotta go somewhere, or...?

512
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,443
Yeah. No. I mean, unh...

513
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,445
I was hoping for the shoot tomorrow...

514
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,032
...we could send Rocky down
and he could pick it up.

515
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:07,909
- Kurt.
- No, hey. Got you.

516
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:10,202
You gotta go somewhere,
so, hey, what the fuck?

517
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:13,039
It's only the photography of the film
we're talking about.

518
00:38:13,206 --> 00:38:16,960
- Are you giving me shit, Kurt?
- No. Hey, no way, Little Bill.

519
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:20,380
My fucking wife has an ass in her cock
in the driveway, Kurt.

520
00:38:20,547 --> 00:38:23,550
All right? I'm sorry if my thoughts
are not on the photography...

521
00:38:23,717 --> 00:38:27,721
- ...of the film we're shooting tomorrow.
- Okay. No big deal. Sorry.

522
00:38:27,887 --> 00:38:30,764
- All right?
- Gotcha.

523
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:46,030
All right, where is it?

524
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:55,081
I think she's sick.

525
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,251
- Oh, what the fuck is this?
- I didn't do anything. I... I didn't...

526
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,545
- Is she breathing?
- I don't know.

527
00:39:01,713 --> 00:39:04,715
- I think maybe she did too much coke.
- Do you think so, doctor?

528
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:07,217
- This girl's definitely OD'd.
- Oh, fuck me. Okay.

529
00:39:07,385 --> 00:39:09,219
I want you to handle this for me, Johnny.

530
00:39:09,387 --> 00:39:10,472
- You listening?
- Yeah.

531
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:14,893
Get her in the car, drive her to Saint Joe's.
Drop her off in the front. I don't want any...

532
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,811
- Got you.
- Make sure no one sees the limo.

533
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,523
- Got it.
- What the fuck is this?

534
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:24,277
This is twice in two days
that a chick has OD'd on me.

535
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:27,447
You think maybe you ought to
think about getting some new shit?

536
00:39:27,614 --> 00:39:28,655
- Yes, sir.
- Ah.

537
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:32,117
- Oh, shit. She's freaking out.
- Oh, see? Look at this.

538
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:34,746
With all this fucking conversation.
Come on. Come on.

539
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:37,873
- Please don't die.
- Hey, hey.

540
00:39:38,041 --> 00:39:39,958
Come on!

541
00:39:41,628 --> 00:39:44,963
- Back door, Johnny.
- You got it.

542
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,175
Fucking shit.

543
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:53,722
Get out of my way.

544
00:39:55,266 --> 00:39:58,186
- Bart, is she all right?
- Shut the fuck up.

545
00:40:27,132 --> 00:40:30,300
- Hey, Reed.
- Hey, Scotty J. How are you?

546
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:33,512
You know, you know. Ha, ha, who's this?

547
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:37,182
Eddie, this is Scotty J. He's a friend.
He works on some of the films.

548
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:39,101
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, yeah. Me too.

549
00:40:39,269 --> 00:40:40,894
Uh, you gonna be working, or...?

550
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:42,856
- Um, maybe.
- Oh.

551
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:45,858
- Probably. Ha, ha.
- That's great. Ha, ha.

552
00:40:46,025 --> 00:40:49,278
How'd you meet Jack? Because I work
on the films, you know, sometimes.

553
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,905
- So if you ever, yeah...
- Hey, Eddie.

554
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:56,286
- Come here a second.
- That's the boy you told me about.

555
00:40:56,786 --> 00:40:58,704
Uh, could you excuse me for a minute?

556
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,873
- Yeah.
- Very nice to meet you.

557
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:03,126
- Take care.
- Yeah.

558
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,590
- Hey.
- Eddie Adams, this is the Colonel.

559
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:10,717
- Hi.
- How do you do, Eddie?

560
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,219
Eddie is, uh, interested in film.

561
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:17,056
Oh. I can't give you much advice
that Jack probably doesn't know...

562
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:19,684
...but I can advise
that you think about your name.

563
00:41:19,851 --> 00:41:20,893
My name. Yeah.

564
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:23,896
Like, think about some name
that makes you happy.

565
00:41:24,063 --> 00:41:26,648
- Something with a little pizzazz, you know?
- Sure.

566
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:32,322
You see, Eddie, the Colonel here,
he puts up all the money for our films.

567
00:41:32,489 --> 00:41:34,740
It's an important part of the process.

568
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:37,659
- Oh. Great, great.
- I'm looking forward to seeing you in action.

569
00:41:37,827 --> 00:41:41,914
- Jack says you got a great big cock.
- Um, well, heh, I don't know. I guess so.

570
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:43,833
May I see it?

571
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,960
- Really?
- Please. Yeah.

572
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:47,753
Okay.

573
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:56,054
- Well, thank you, Eddie.
- No problem.

574
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,764
- Thanks, Eddie.
- Bye.

575
00:42:24,791 --> 00:42:27,751
- You wanna hear a poem I wrote?
- Yeah.

576
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,420
Okay.

577
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:35,927
<i>I love you, you love me
Going down the sugar tree</i>

578
00:42:36,135 --> 00:42:40,974
<i>We'll go down the sugar tree
And see lots of bees</i>

579
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:44,351
<i>Playing, playing</i>

580
00:42:44,644 --> 00:42:48,815
<i>But the bees won't sting
Because you love me</i>

581
00:42:49,065 --> 00:42:51,400
- That's it.
- That's fucking great. Did you write that?

582
00:42:51,568 --> 00:42:55,487
- Yeah. I write songs too. I'm still working...
- How's it going, boys?

583
00:42:55,655 --> 00:42:57,739
Hey, Jack.

584
00:42:58,617 --> 00:42:59,659
Having a good time?

585
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:02,327
Excellent time. Thank you, Jack.
It was a great party.

586
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:05,789
- The best.
- Ah, that's what Jackie's house is for.

587
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,833
To have a good time. Right?

588
00:43:08,001 --> 00:43:09,501
- That's right.
- Coming in.

589
00:43:11,963 --> 00:43:13,672
- Woo-hoo. Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.

590
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:18,052
- Ah, how about a little bubbles?
- Oh, yeah.

591
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:22,472
- Excuse me, Jack.
- Yeah?

592
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:25,393
I was thinking about what the Colonel
was saying, about my name.

593
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:28,186
- Uh-huh.
- I was just wondering if you had any ideas.

594
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:31,773
I had some thoughts on it, yeah.
What about you? What do you think?

595
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:35,527
Well, my idea was...
You know, I just want a name...

596
00:43:35,695 --> 00:43:38,364
I want it so it can cut glass,
you know, like razor-sharp.

597
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:39,824
Razor-sharp. Right.

598
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:43,869
Yeah, well, when I close my eyes,
I see this thing. It's like this big sign.

599
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:46,539
And the name is in,
like, bright-blue neon lights...

600
00:43:46,706 --> 00:43:49,041
...with, like, purple outline.

601
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:54,005
And this name is just so bright and so
sharp that the sign, it just blows up...

602
00:43:54,172 --> 00:43:57,215
...because the name is just so powerful.

603
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:08,311
It says, "Dirk Diggler."

604
00:44:08,561 --> 00:44:13,733
I think... I think heaven has
sent you here, Dirk Diggler.

605
00:44:15,068 --> 00:44:18,820
I think the angels have blessed us all
because of you.

606
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:22,282
- You're Dirk. Ha, ha.
- Dirk Diggler, ha, ha.

607
00:44:22,659 --> 00:44:24,409
Amen.

608
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:32,585
Talk to me, Kurt.

609
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,170
- Twenty to 30.
- Oy.

610
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:38,382
- I got a couple tough shadows to deal with.
- There's shadows in life, baby.

611
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,092
- Jack.
- Yo.

612
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:44,389
- You, uh, wanna go over this?
- Okay.

613
00:44:44,597 --> 00:44:48,016
Uh, the setup is... Okay, here we go.

614
00:44:48,184 --> 00:44:50,103
Uh, "One, Amber talking to Becky.

615
00:44:50,269 --> 00:44:53,231
They make the telephone call to the agents
to send over some actors.

616
00:44:53,398 --> 00:44:58,902
Two, enter Reed to audition for Amber.
They go at it. Becky watches.

617
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:01,739
Three, Becky goes to the bathroom
to jack off.

618
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:04,574
She gets interrupted by Amber.
They go at it.

619
00:45:04,742 --> 00:45:06,619
Four..."

620
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:10,331
Who's "Dirk...? Dirk Diggler?"

621
00:45:10,498 --> 00:45:14,043
That's that new, good-looking kid.
Eddie at the club.

622
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:15,293
- Good name.
- Yeah.

623
00:45:15,461 --> 00:45:18,297
Anyway, uh, "Enter Dirk. He meets Becky.
They go at it."

624
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:22,802
No, ugh. Change that, will you? Uh...
I want Eddie to be auditioning for Amber.

625
00:45:22,969 --> 00:45:24,637
Got it.

626
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:28,141
- Darling, where are you going?
- Huh? I gotta go wash my vagina.

627
00:45:28,307 --> 00:45:30,684
- How long will you be?
- Two seconds.

628
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,686
You want it clean, don't you?

629
00:45:36,315 --> 00:45:38,400
I'm back now. I'm ready to start my...

630
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:42,028
- Come in.
- Hey.

631
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:44,157
- Hi.
- Ha, ha. Hi.

632
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:46,909
Dirk. Dirk Diggler.

633
00:45:48,286 --> 00:45:50,954
- Scotty.
- Yeah, uh...

634
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:55,001
I'm supposed to come get you now
and tell you that they're all ready now.

635
00:45:55,168 --> 00:45:57,628
- Okay.
- Yeah. Okay.

636
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:02,842
Do you think you could give me a minute?

637
00:46:04,844 --> 00:46:05,887
Thanks.

638
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:14,186
I'm back now.
I'm ready to start my acting career.

639
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:25,197
That's right.

640
00:46:30,286 --> 00:46:32,454
- Hey.
- Hey.

641
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:34,664
- You look really good.
- Oh, thank you.

642
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:36,833
Ahem. And you look really sexy.

643
00:46:37,001 --> 00:46:38,920
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

644
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:45,717
- I like your name a lot.
- You do?

645
00:46:45,885 --> 00:46:47,344
Yeah. It's really cool.

646
00:46:47,512 --> 00:46:49,554
- Thanks.
- Yeah. Heh.

647
00:46:54,268 --> 00:46:56,603
You'll be right down there.

648
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:07,030
Thanks. Hey.

649
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:09,242
- Ho, how's my boy?
- Great.

650
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:10,659
- How you feeling?
- Let's do it.

651
00:47:10,827 --> 00:47:12,286
Ha, ha. All right.

652
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:14,496
- Remember everything we talked about?
- Yeah.

653
00:47:14,664 --> 00:47:18,708
Okay, now, you're gonna come through
the door, walk right over here...

654
00:47:18,876 --> 00:47:23,588
...I'll... I'll say, uh, "Action, Eddie."
That'll be your cue, right?

655
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:26,550
You come through the door,
you walk over here to the desk...

656
00:47:26,717 --> 00:47:29,637
...to Amber, and we shoot.

657
00:47:29,804 --> 00:47:32,931
- Um, do we go right into the sex, or...?
- I need some more fill.

658
00:47:33,099 --> 00:47:34,891
- Ls that all right?
- Good.

659
00:47:35,059 --> 00:47:37,018
- Is it okay with you?
- That looks good.

660
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:39,438
- Amber?
- Good.

661
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:43,233
- Okay.
- Okay. You don't need a rehearsal?

662
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:45,027
No, it's okay. I can do it.

663
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,987
Okay, then we'll shoot the rehearsal.

664
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:48,530
- Great.
- All right.

665
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,740
- Um, could I ask you something, Jack?
- Sure.

666
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:53,244
Um, I was wondering if you could, um...

667
00:47:53,411 --> 00:47:56,289
...call me Dirk Diggler from now on.

668
00:47:56,581 --> 00:47:57,789
- Absolutely.
- Great. Heh.

669
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,125
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no. It's...

670
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:01,878
- No, no. From now on.
- Thanks.

671
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:03,880
Okay, let's get a good one.

672
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:07,382
- Do you wanna practice your lines with me?
- No, I know it.

673
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:09,635
- You look great, honey.
- Thanks.

674
00:48:09,802 --> 00:48:12,054
Um, does he want me to keep going
until I come?

675
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:15,641
- Yeah. You just come when you're ready.
- Okay. Well, where should I do it?

676
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:17,101
Where do you want?

677
00:48:17,268 --> 00:48:19,436
Wherever you tell me.

678
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:21,480
Well, come on my tits if you can, okay?

679
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:24,775
Just pull it out and do it on my stomach
and my tits if you can.

680
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:27,527
Yeah. No problem.

681
00:48:31,574 --> 00:48:33,034
Are you all right, honey?

682
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:35,827
Oh, this is great. I'm fine.
I just wanna do good.

683
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:38,164
- I just want it to be really good.
- Mm-hm.

684
00:48:38,331 --> 00:48:42,835
I was wondering, is it okay if I really try
to make it look sexy? Would that be okay?

685
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:45,338
- Okay.
- Great.

686
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,092
- You ready?
- Yeah.

687
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:53,929
Make your entrance through this door.
He'll call, "Action." That's your cue.

688
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:56,014
- You got the lines for the scene?
- Uh-huh.

689
00:48:56,182 --> 00:48:58,726
If you drop one, just call for it,
but do not stop, okay?

690
00:48:58,893 --> 00:49:00,518
Do not stop. You want some water?

691
00:49:00,686 --> 00:49:03,438
- No, I'm fine. Thanks.
- Okay. You're gonna do fine.

692
00:49:03,898 --> 00:49:05,775
Roll it, Scotty.

693
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:08,902
Speed. Ahem.

694
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:10,862
- Sticks.
- Marker.

695
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:13,490
- Yeah?
- Camera's set.

696
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:15,826
- We're ready, chief.
- Okay.

697
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:18,079
And...

698
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:21,791
...action, Dirk.

699
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,463
Hello. Are you John?

700
00:49:29,632 --> 00:49:30,800
Yes, ma'am.

701
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:33,469
Your agency recommends you very highly.

702
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:37,389
Well, I'm a really hard worker, and if
you give me a job, I won't disappoint you.

703
00:49:37,556 --> 00:49:40,476
- What special skills do you have?
- Well, I just got...

704
00:49:40,643 --> 00:49:44,313
I've been in the Marines for three years.
I just got back from a tour of duty.

705
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:46,565
- You're kidding.
- No, I'm not.

706
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:50,152
And it got really hard being surrounded
by all those guys all day.

707
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,405
How long has it been
since you've had a woman?

708
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:55,782
- A long time.
- That's terrible.

709
00:49:56,242 --> 00:49:59,996
But now I'm back,
and I'm ready to pursue my acting career.

710
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:03,416
Well, as you may or may not know,
this is an important film for me.

711
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:06,335
If it's not a hit,
I'm gonna get kicked out of my apartment.

712
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:09,588
- My landlord's a real jerk.
- Really?

713
00:50:09,755 --> 00:50:13,592
Why don't you take your pants off?
It's important I get an idea of your size.

714
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,552
No problem.

715
00:50:20,474 --> 00:50:22,184
Oh.

716
00:50:47,168 --> 00:50:51,963
I think that you have the job,
but why don't I make sure of something?

717
00:50:54,925 --> 00:50:57,469
This is a giant cock.

718
00:52:38,028 --> 00:52:39,612
We've rolled out.

719
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:42,157
Uh, we gotta change mags.

720
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:44,742
Do it quickly.

721
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:53,126
- Kids.
- Ls everything cool?

722
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:56,088
It's going great.
We just gotta change the angle.

723
00:52:56,255 --> 00:52:58,090
Does it...? Does it look sexy?

724
00:52:58,257 --> 00:53:01,342
- Oh, it's great.
- You're doing so good, Dirk.

725
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:03,762
- Does it feel good?
- Yep.

726
00:53:10,269 --> 00:53:11,896
Okay?

727
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,438
Roll sound, Scotty.

728
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:18,860
Speed.

729
00:53:19,612 --> 00:53:21,697
Quiet. Sticks.

730
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:27,619
Marker.

731
00:53:27,786 --> 00:53:29,454
We're back.

732
00:53:30,331 --> 00:53:31,581
Action, kids.

733
00:53:32,958 --> 00:53:36,628
- We're gonna go down now.
- Okay.

734
00:53:36,795 --> 00:53:41,925
- No. No, first... Down again.
- Okay.

735
00:53:47,306 --> 00:53:50,601
John, you're a wonderful actor.

736
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:53,019
Oh, John.

737
00:53:59,443 --> 00:54:00,985
- Oh, John.
- Yeah.

738
00:54:01,153 --> 00:54:04,322
John, you're a wonderful actor.

739
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:21,172
- You're amazing.
- Oh, you feel so good, Amber.

740
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:23,050
- Are you ready to come?
- Yeah.

741
00:54:23,217 --> 00:54:25,344
- Come in me.
- What?

742
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:29,306
Don't worry. I'm fixed.
I want you to come in me.

743
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:31,266
- Okay. Yeah.
- Yeah?

744
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:32,851
Okay.

745
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:42,193
Oh, God, yeah.

746
00:54:47,449 --> 00:54:49,201
Wonderful.

747
00:54:50,077 --> 00:54:53,454
- Cut. Terrific. Nice work. Nice work.
- All right.

748
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:56,125
Congratulations.
That was great, wasn't it?

749
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:57,835
- Wasn't that sexy?
- Rock 'n' roll.

750
00:54:58,003 --> 00:54:59,545
- That was something.
- Really good.

751
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:01,045
It looked great. Very sexy.

752
00:55:01,213 --> 00:55:03,340
- Doesn't he fuck like a champ?
- Was it sexy?

753
00:55:03,507 --> 00:55:04,717
- You rocked.
- Thanks.

754
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:07,552
- Hey, the camera loves you.
- We didn't get the come shot.

755
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,346
- What?
- We missed the come shot.

756
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:11,139
He came inside of her.

757
00:55:11,307 --> 00:55:13,976
Maybe we could,
like, go to stock footage or...

758
00:55:14,143 --> 00:55:17,813
Are you crazy? It won't match.

759
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:19,023
- Well...
- Jack.

760
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:22,985
- Hmm?
- I could do it again if you need a close-up.

761
00:55:28,449 --> 00:55:30,659
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

762
00:55:31,452 --> 00:55:33,286
Okay, everyone say, "Dirk."

763
00:55:33,454 --> 00:55:34,788
Dirk.

764
00:55:36,498 --> 00:55:37,583
These are real wood.

765
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:40,710
No, these. These are the ones.
These are great.

766
00:55:40,878 --> 00:55:42,920
Yeah. Those are really cool.
Are they lizard?

767
00:55:43,088 --> 00:55:46,090
No. They're ltalian.
I'm gonna fucking buy these.

768
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:49,969
Guys.

769
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:54,141
It's funny you say that
because we should be in a band, you know?

770
00:56:02,608 --> 00:56:04,610
- Like my shoes?
- They're cool.

771
00:56:04,777 --> 00:56:07,195
I got them with Reed and Scotty.
They're cool, huh?

772
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,655
- Yeah.
- You know, embossed leather...

773
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:13,284
...with this patchwork,
reptilian-pattern design.

774
00:56:13,452 --> 00:56:15,411
- Cool.
- Can we have some hot sauce here?

775
00:56:15,579 --> 00:56:17,331
- Oh, hi, Scotty.
- Hi, Scotty.

776
00:56:17,498 --> 00:56:20,250
- Come on, sit down and help yourself.
- Oh, thanks.

777
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:21,501
Say hello to Jaime Lynn.

778
00:56:21,668 --> 00:56:24,295
- Scotty, this is Jaime Lynn.
- I was thinking about the...

779
00:56:24,463 --> 00:56:26,382
Scotty, Jaime Lynn.
Say hello to Jaime Lynn.

780
00:56:26,548 --> 00:56:28,467
- You're a Leo, huh?
- That's right.

781
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:31,135
- Hey, my girlfriend wants to meet you.
- Ls that right?

782
00:56:31,304 --> 00:56:33,847
- This is Raymond.
- How do you do? What's your name?

783
00:56:34,014 --> 00:56:35,974
- Becky Barnett.
- Excuse me?

784
00:56:36,141 --> 00:56:38,018
Becky Barnett.

785
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:40,771
- Raymond's a Leo.
- I knew it. I knew it.

786
00:56:40,938 --> 00:56:42,648
- What's your sign?
- I'm a Pisces.

787
00:56:42,815 --> 00:56:44,983
What? I can't deal with no Pisces.

788
00:56:45,150 --> 00:56:47,110
- That shirt's pretty sexy too.
- Well, yeah.

789
00:56:47,277 --> 00:56:50,030
Well, this is, um, like,
imported Italian nylon...

790
00:56:50,197 --> 00:56:53,282
...and, uh, it's like a special-edition,
limited silk print...

791
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:57,746
...and it was done by this really famous,
um, design artist from ltaly.

792
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:58,956
Pick a card, man.

793
00:56:59,123 --> 00:57:01,375
What's up, baby? I love you.
Picture later, baby.

794
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:04,920
What table's that going to?
Four? Five, Jose. Five.

795
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:09,007
What's happening, my man?
You alive, man. I thought you were dead.

796
00:57:09,175 --> 00:57:12,677
- Yo, what's up, people?
- Rise from the deck.

797
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:14,262
Oh.

798
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:16,264
- Damn, that's...
- Two of diamonds, right?

799
00:57:16,432 --> 00:57:18,474
- That's my card. That is incredible.
- Right.

800
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:22,688
But doesn't it make you nervous when
you're dealing with all those evil forces?

801
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:24,398
Horses? What?

802
00:57:24,565 --> 00:57:26,983
No. The evil forces.

803
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:30,695
Evil? No, man. It's not evil.
It's an illusion.

804
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:33,532
- It's an illusion.
- Yeah. Yeah, it's confusing.

805
00:57:33,699 --> 00:57:35,409
Thank you.

806
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:37,369
Listen up, kid. Listen up.

807
00:57:37,536 --> 00:57:40,621
I'm gonna try and do this all in one shot,
know what I mean?

808
00:57:40,789 --> 00:57:43,625
So we start like this,
and then you roll her over, Dirk.

809
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:45,793
Rollergirl, you roll right over with him.

810
00:57:45,961 --> 00:57:48,505
Try to give me every single position.
Is that possible?

811
00:57:48,672 --> 00:57:51,215
Well, if she...
Rollergirl, if you wrap your leg around...

812
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:53,050
No, the other one, the left one.

813
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:56,847
Around and over. Good.
See, we can go right into doggy style.

814
00:57:57,014 --> 00:57:58,556
Perfect.

815
00:57:59,141 --> 00:58:01,476
Is the movement on a waterbed
gonna be a problem?

816
00:58:01,643 --> 00:58:03,978
No, not at all, Kurt.
I mean, I dig it. It's great.

817
00:58:04,146 --> 00:58:05,521
- Okay, can we do this?
- Yeah.

818
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:07,983
All right, everybody, here we go.

819
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:10,735
- This is gonna be great. Jack.
- Yeah?

820
00:58:10,903 --> 00:58:12,737
Do you want me
to use a Spanish accent?

821
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:24,500
"Jack Horner has found something special
in newcomer Dirk Diggler.

822
00:58:24,666 --> 00:58:28,586
It's another stellar sexual standout
from Horner and Company.

823
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:32,298
Diggler delivers a performance
worth a thousand hard-ons.

824
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:35,635
His presence when dressed is powerful
and demanding.

825
00:58:35,802 --> 00:58:37,721
When stripped to the bone...

826
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:40,766
...Diggler's more eruptive than a volcano
on a bad day.

827
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:43,476
Amber Waves' ripe cherry lips
do a wonderful job...

828
00:58:43,644 --> 00:58:45,561
...of handling Diggler's wide load.

829
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:47,940
And Reed Rothchild's stiff biceps...

830
00:58:48,106 --> 00:58:52,945
...do a slapping good job
with Becky Barnett's supple ass.

831
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:55,780
But it's Diggler that
remains the standout in this film.

832
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:58,282
It's easy to predict
that after only two films...

833
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:01,494
...that Diggler's success
can only grow and grow and grow...

834
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:04,121
...and grow and grow and grow...

835
00:59:04,289 --> 00:59:08,626
...and grow and grow and grow."

836
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:16,193
- What else?
- Well, that's it for now.

837
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:19,864
I mean, look at the character
Holmes came up with, for instance.

838
01:00:20,032 --> 01:00:23,619
- And look, I just...
- Tell me.

839
01:00:24,161 --> 01:00:27,664
I don't like seeing women treated that way.
This guy he plays, Johnny Wadd...

840
01:00:27,831 --> 01:00:32,043
It's always about slapping some girl around
or whatever. It's not right. It's not cool.

841
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:35,297
It's just not sexy. I mean,
it's not sexy like it should be, Jack.

842
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:38,342
This guy's more of like
a James Bond-type character.

843
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:42,137
You know, he's classy.
He's a world-traveled guy.

844
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:46,391
- I like that.
- Reed could play my partner.

845
01:00:48,226 --> 01:00:50,896
- I like that a lot.
- We could make it really good, Jack.

846
01:00:51,063 --> 01:00:54,608
Honestly, if you direct it,
we make a whole series with a whole story.

847
01:00:54,775 --> 01:00:57,193
I mean, it's exactly
what we've always talked about.

848
01:00:58,278 --> 01:00:59,905
Please?

849
01:01:00,072 --> 01:01:03,367
When we get back, set up the typewriter.

850
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:06,327
We'll see what comes out of it.

851
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:09,748
But I have to talk to the Colonel
when we get to Vegas.

852
01:01:10,123 --> 01:01:12,918
And, Dirk, you gotta
work on the Colonel too, Dirk.

853
01:01:13,085 --> 01:01:14,543
I mean, you gotta be committed.

854
01:01:14,711 --> 01:01:17,880
Right, right. Jack,
I'll do whatever I have to do.

855
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:20,509
Does this character have a name?

856
01:01:22,219 --> 01:01:25,429
His name is Brock Landers.

857
01:01:25,597 --> 01:01:27,891
His partner's name is Chest Rockwell.

858
01:01:30,769 --> 01:01:32,436
Those are great names.

859
01:01:33,271 --> 01:01:36,775
And the award for best newcomer
goes to...

860
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:40,612
Yes. My baby boy. Dirk Diggler.
Whoo.

861
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:43,072
And the award for best cock goes to...

862
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:44,990
Here we go again. Dirk Diggler.

863
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:48,202
The award for best actor goes to... Aah!

864
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:51,206
I've seen all his movies,
and I can't wait to work with him.

865
01:01:51,373 --> 01:01:53,708
Mr. Dirk Diggler.

866
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:32,748
Wow.

867
01:02:32,914 --> 01:02:35,416
- I don't know what to say.
- Come on, say it.

868
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:36,668
I guess...

869
01:02:36,835 --> 01:02:37,960
Wow.

870
01:02:38,128 --> 01:02:40,172
I guess the only thing I can say...

871
01:02:40,338 --> 01:02:43,507
...is I'll promise to keep rocking
'n' rolling and making better films.

872
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:49,722
You know, it seems we make
these movies and sometimes, you know...

873
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:52,601
...they're considered filthy or something
by some people...

874
01:02:52,768 --> 01:02:54,894
...but I don't think that's true.

875
01:02:55,061 --> 01:02:57,898
These movies we make,
they can be better.

876
01:02:58,065 --> 01:03:00,983
They can help. They really can.
I mean that.

877
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:03,320
We can always do better.

878
01:03:03,487 --> 01:03:05,864
I'm gonna keep trying
if you guys keep trying.

879
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:07,740
Let's keep rocking 'n' rolling, man.

880
01:03:10,869 --> 01:03:21,170
Yeah!

881
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:26,175
Marker.

882
01:03:26,885 --> 01:03:28,344
Set.

883
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:48,572
Shot of tequila, straight up.

884
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:50,574
Yes, ma'am.

885
01:03:51,702 --> 01:03:55,956
I've been in this place for 20 minutes
just to get a seat.

886
01:03:56,498 --> 01:03:59,918
- Are you alone?
- Yeah. Just visiting L.A.

887
01:04:00,085 --> 01:04:03,128
Some people told me
the food in here was really good.

888
01:04:03,297 --> 01:04:05,257
Good? It's not good.

889
01:04:05,423 --> 01:04:09,427
It's probably the best place to eat
in all of Los Angeles. It's excellent.

890
01:04:09,594 --> 01:04:11,262
I certainly hope so.

891
01:04:11,429 --> 01:04:14,599
I could die of starvation
before I get something in my mouth.

892
01:04:16,726 --> 01:04:18,728
Still hungry?

893
01:04:19,521 --> 01:04:21,523
Starving.

894
01:04:24,610 --> 01:04:28,028
- Why don't you feast on that?
- Okay.

895
01:04:37,914 --> 01:04:40,208
Oh, it's true.

896
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:41,918
What's that?

897
01:04:42,711 --> 01:04:45,130
You are Brock Landers.

898
01:05:08,362 --> 01:05:12,282
Freeze! Don't make me chase you, Raphael!

899
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:25,545
Freeze!

900
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:43,855
We're almost there. Here's what I want.
I want you to trim the head.

901
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:47,192
Take that shot of Reed with the revolver,
just dump that, okay?

902
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:48,735
And switch the title card.

903
01:05:48,902 --> 01:05:52,237
I want it to come flying right out
of the screen, right at the audience.

904
01:05:52,405 --> 01:05:55,074
- Nice. Piece of cake.
- That's my guy.

905
01:05:58,036 --> 01:06:00,371
I told him,
"This is a special party for Scotty J.

906
01:06:00,539 --> 01:06:02,998
I want your lightest,
bubbliest champagne."

907
01:06:03,166 --> 01:06:04,416
So this is what he gave me.

908
01:06:04,585 --> 01:06:07,170
I want you take a little sip
and tell me what you think.

909
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:10,590
This is supposed to be really good stuff.
Here. Take a sip.

910
01:06:11,967 --> 01:06:13,510
- Ls that pretty light?
- Yeah, that is.

911
01:06:13,677 --> 01:06:15,804
- Baby, it's beautiful.
- What do you think?

912
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,054
- It's great?
- Yeah.

913
01:06:17,222 --> 01:06:19,724
- Look how spacious it is.
- Yeah. Look, I like this too.

914
01:06:19,891 --> 01:06:22,559
That's custom-made.
That's real imported ltalian leather.

915
01:06:22,728 --> 01:06:25,105
- This color is very unusual.
- Watch this.

916
01:06:25,271 --> 01:06:27,273
- What's that?
- My initials.

917
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:29,775
Oh, that's so imaginative.
How'd you think of that?

918
01:06:29,943 --> 01:06:32,528
I was just thinking of my name one day
and dreamt it up.

919
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:33,737
- Hi, Dirk.
- How are you?

920
01:06:33,905 --> 01:06:35,532
- I'm almost finished.
- Looks great.

921
01:06:35,699 --> 01:06:38,242
I used a little poetic license
to capture your essence.

922
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:40,452
- Show me the rest of the house?
- Looks great.

923
01:06:40,621 --> 01:06:42,496
Yeah, it's good for conversation, huh?

924
01:06:42,664 --> 01:06:46,918
Yeah. Jessie did that oil painting as well
and Buck is still installing the stereo.

925
01:06:47,085 --> 01:06:48,711
- That's a beanbag.
- You're kidding.

926
01:06:48,878 --> 01:06:52,923
And that lamp, those are real sterling silver.
Yeah, they have a very modern feel too.

927
01:06:53,092 --> 01:06:55,552
This could be the place
you could have conversations.

928
01:06:55,719 --> 01:06:57,262
- You ready?
- What is this? Yeah.

929
01:06:57,429 --> 01:06:58,929
- Ta-da.
- Oh.

930
01:06:59,097 --> 01:07:03,601
- This is my dojo.
- It's all Asian. You have an Asian room.

931
01:07:03,768 --> 01:07:06,938
- Yeah. It has that whole karate feel.
- Nice. It's very comfortable.

932
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:09,440
- Yeah. A lot of ancient China.
- That's really good.

933
01:07:09,608 --> 01:07:11,568
I have my statues for my best-actor awards.

934
01:07:11,735 --> 01:07:13,902
You have a place
to keep your awards. I'm glad.

935
01:07:14,070 --> 01:07:15,739
Look up there.

936
01:07:15,947 --> 01:07:17,197
Oh, that's handy.

937
01:07:17,365 --> 01:07:18,782
- Can you see yourself?
- Yeah.

938
01:07:18,951 --> 01:07:20,452
- That's great, huh?
- That's nice.

939
01:07:20,619 --> 01:07:21,619
- Ta-da.
- Oh.

940
01:07:21,786 --> 01:07:23,746
- My whole entire wardrobe.
- That's great.

941
01:07:23,914 --> 01:07:27,125
It's all perfectly organized by color,
as well as designer.

942
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:31,755
You don't have to think about anything. You
just reach in and know right where it is.

943
01:07:31,922 --> 01:07:33,213
- You're gonna love it.
- Yeah?

944
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:36,425
This is my favorite thing
in the whole world. Close your eyes.

945
01:07:36,594 --> 01:07:38,594
- Okay, you ready?
- Yeah, baby.

946
01:07:43,934 --> 01:07:46,061
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Oh, God. Heh.

947
01:07:46,561 --> 01:07:49,563
This is it. This is the thing.

948
01:07:49,731 --> 01:07:51,190
You deserve this, baby.

949
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:55,235
Isn't it great? This is the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen in my whole life.

950
01:07:55,403 --> 01:07:57,530
- You wanna go for a ride?
- Oh, yeah. Heh.

951
01:07:58,532 --> 01:08:00,574
Let's do this thing. She rocks.

952
01:08:00,742 --> 01:08:02,159
Whoo.

953
01:08:02,327 --> 01:08:03,619
- Yeah!
- Ha, ha.

954
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:05,829
- Hold on.
- Ha, ha.

955
01:08:05,998 --> 01:08:09,083
- You set us up, Chico.
- You wanna fuck with Raphael and Ringo...

956
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:12,795
...that's your business.
You don't fuck with Chest and Brock.

957
01:08:13,213 --> 01:08:15,215
- No...
- You know what?

958
01:08:15,382 --> 01:08:16,882
- No.
- You're not even worth it.

959
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:19,219
I gave you a chance.

960
01:08:23,474 --> 01:08:24,765
I trusted him.

961
01:08:26,976 --> 01:08:30,229
Well, we almost solved the case.

962
01:08:31,606 --> 01:08:33,774
At least the women are safe.

963
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:37,194
Let's go get some of that
Saturday-night beaver.

964
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:41,323
No one fucks with Chest and Brock.

965
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:44,868
This is the best work we've ever done.

966
01:08:45,037 --> 01:08:47,538
It's a real film, Jack.

967
01:08:49,207 --> 01:08:52,752
- It feels good.
- You made it fly.

968
01:08:54,255 --> 01:08:57,923
You know, this is the film...

969
01:08:58,759 --> 01:09:00,510
...I want them to remember me by.

970
01:09:11,438 --> 01:09:13,064
Thank you.

971
01:09:31,792 --> 01:09:35,127
You know, as far as I'm concerned,
it's all about love, you know?

972
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:38,672
I mean, if you love someone,
how hard can the world be?

973
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:42,260
I mean, uh, people will come
and they will go, and so will problems...

974
01:09:42,427 --> 01:09:47,681
...but ultimately, if you have got love
on your side, and it is just...

975
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:52,436
I mean,
it is just deep down in your soul...

976
01:09:53,271 --> 01:09:57,399
...what's a problem gonna be
that takes your attention away from that?

977
01:09:58,903 --> 01:10:00,737
Do you understand?

978
01:10:02,238 --> 01:10:06,158
- I'm Becky Barnett.
- I'm Jerome.

979
01:10:06,327 --> 01:10:08,828
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too, Becky.

980
01:10:08,996 --> 01:10:12,748
- So, what do you do?
- Oh, uh, I'm in the auto industry.

981
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:14,000
Oh.

982
01:10:14,167 --> 01:10:16,627
Yeah, I'm a regional manager
over at Pep Boys.

983
01:10:16,795 --> 01:10:17,921
Oh. Wow.

984
01:10:18,087 --> 01:10:19,588
That's great. That's great.

985
01:10:19,756 --> 01:10:21,466
You've got a really nice smile, Becky.

986
01:10:22,801 --> 01:10:24,301
Thank you, heh, heh...

987
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:26,511
- ...Jerome. Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.

988
01:10:39,484 --> 01:10:42,487
- The Colonel.
- Excuse me.

989
01:10:43,029 --> 01:10:47,783
Floyd Gondolli. Ha, ha. Great you
could make it. Great, great, great.

990
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:51,412
- How are you? You look happy.
- I'm fine.

991
01:10:51,579 --> 01:10:53,747
- Meet boys, Tommy, Pete.
- Hi.

992
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:55,875
Meet girls, Cyndi, Angie.

993
01:10:56,042 --> 01:10:57,252
- Hi.
- Hi.

994
01:10:57,418 --> 01:10:59,671
- These are the next stars.
- Mm-hm.

995
01:10:59,837 --> 01:11:03,257
- These are the real people in the world.
- Ah, ahem.

996
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:07,679
I think we ought to talk with Jack now.
Iron this out before we start the new year?

997
01:11:07,845 --> 01:11:08,845
Let's do it.

998
01:11:09,347 --> 01:11:12,684
What were you thinking? What
were you feeling? Did you do research?

999
01:11:12,850 --> 01:11:14,685
- Hi, Amber.
- What are you talking about?

1000
01:11:14,853 --> 01:11:17,980
- Oh, nothing.
- You wanna come with me for a little while?

1001
01:11:18,148 --> 01:11:21,192
- Where?
- It's a surprise, surprise, surprise.

1002
01:11:21,359 --> 01:11:23,860
Yeah. Let's go. Excuse me, Jessie.

1003
01:11:53,057 --> 01:11:56,435
- Hey, Buck.
- Hey, Jessie. How you doing?

1004
01:11:56,603 --> 01:11:59,564
- You sitting alone?
- Yes.

1005
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:06,069
- Todd Parker.
- Rocking Reed Rothchild.

1006
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:10,574
- Aw, you made it. Yeah. Woo-hoo.
- Yeah.

1007
01:12:10,826 --> 01:12:12,993
Amazing party, man.
Fucking chicks everywhere.

1008
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:15,747
You bet. Courtesy of Jack Horner.
Thank you.

1009
01:12:15,913 --> 01:12:19,000
I wouldn't mind me having
a piece of that action right over there.

1010
01:12:19,167 --> 01:12:20,877
That's Michelle. I'll introduce you.

1011
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:24,796
- Sure. Introduce her to my lap.
- Ha, ha. Did you get off work, man?

1012
01:12:24,965 --> 01:12:27,091
- I don't dance Sunday nights.
- Right.

1013
01:12:27,259 --> 01:12:30,302
- Whose Vette is that out in the driveway?
- Dirk.

1014
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:32,596
- I'm so jealous of him.
- That shit's jamming.

1015
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:35,932
It's dropped down low with a 350 cube,
3-and-a-quarter horsepower...

1016
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:39,103
...4-speed, 4.10 gears,
10 coats of competition orange...

1017
01:12:39,270 --> 01:12:41,939
...hand-rubbed lacquer
with a dual-plane manifold.

1018
01:12:42,106 --> 01:12:44,233
Tsk, full fucking race cams. Whoa.

1019
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:45,943
Yep.

1020
01:12:53,159 --> 01:12:55,453
I'm pretty happy with it, you know.

1021
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:57,329
It's a great look for you, I think.

1022
01:12:57,497 --> 01:13:00,500
It's pretty original, you know, I think.

1023
01:13:00,667 --> 01:13:02,210
Right.

1024
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:06,671
Heh. I'm gonna take this off.

1025
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:10,967
- Ha, ha.
- Yeah.

1026
01:13:11,136 --> 01:13:12,970
What were we talking about before?

1027
01:13:13,137 --> 01:13:16,724
- Um, oil painting?
- No.

1028
01:13:16,975 --> 01:13:20,811
- No... Yes. I mean, um, but I was saying...
- Oh, oh, oh. Sunsets.

1029
01:13:20,979 --> 01:13:23,730
Right, yeah.
I was saying that I love sunsets.

1030
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:27,150
- But sunrises are better. Heh.
- Exactly. Ha, ha.

1031
01:13:27,319 --> 01:13:29,779
I thought I was the only one
who felt that way.

1032
01:13:29,947 --> 01:13:31,823
- No, I feel that way.
- Really?

1033
01:13:31,989 --> 01:13:35,326
Yes, really. Hey, have you ever heard
my stereo system?

1034
01:13:35,493 --> 01:13:38,703
- No.
- I'm gonna open my own business.

1035
01:13:38,872 --> 01:13:41,998
- Really?
- Yes. Yes. It's my dream.

1036
01:13:42,167 --> 01:13:47,130
Okay, it's hi-fi stereo equipment
at discount prices.

1037
01:13:47,296 --> 01:13:50,550
Yeah. It's called
Buck's Super Stereo World.

1038
01:13:50,716 --> 01:13:53,219
- That is a fucking great idea. Heh.
- Yeah.

1039
01:13:53,386 --> 01:13:57,515
You know, in the 80s,
that's when it's gonna happen for real.

1040
01:13:57,682 --> 01:14:00,350
- Really?
- Yes, really. The 1980s.

1041
01:14:00,519 --> 01:14:01,560
Wow.

1042
01:14:03,396 --> 01:14:06,774
I wanted you to give me a minute
so I could tell you how much I love you.

1043
01:14:06,942 --> 01:14:10,528
I mean, it's gonna be a new year and
we're gonna start things and do things...

1044
01:14:10,695 --> 01:14:14,198
...and I just wanted you to know
how much I care about you.

1045
01:14:14,365 --> 01:14:15,824
I really care about you, honey.

1046
01:14:15,993 --> 01:14:17,868
- You're my little baby.
- Thank you, Amber.

1047
01:14:18,036 --> 01:14:22,539
You're the best thing that's happened to me
since my son went off, and I just...

1048
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:25,376
I love you, honey.

1049
01:14:25,543 --> 01:14:27,587
I love you too.

1050
01:14:29,256 --> 01:14:31,841
Fucking 1980, you know?

1051
01:14:32,009 --> 01:14:33,467
- Can you believe it?
- I can't.

1052
01:14:33,635 --> 01:14:38,430
I mean, it's like, the next thing you know
it's gonna be, like, 1990 and 2000.

1053
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:40,557
- I mean, can you imagine?
- Hmm.

1054
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:46,564
Goodbye, 1979. Hello, 1980.

1055
01:14:46,731 --> 01:14:48,064
Okay.

1056
01:14:48,233 --> 01:14:52,569
Make sure you snort it back real quick
and hard.

1057
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:55,489
- Huh?
- Like this.

1058
01:15:02,456 --> 01:15:04,039
Okay.

1059
01:15:09,087 --> 01:15:12,006
- Ugh, it burns.
- It's good though, right?

1060
01:15:12,466 --> 01:15:14,091
- It's going in my throat.
- Hmm.

1061
01:15:14,259 --> 01:15:16,969
That's the drip. The drip's the best part.

1062
01:15:17,136 --> 01:15:20,430
- It tastes like aspirin.
- Here. Do one more in the other nostril.

1063
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:23,184
- I need a drink of water, I think.
- Mm-mm.

1064
01:15:23,351 --> 01:15:26,561
One more, and then a drink of water.

1065
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:34,862
Do you think I look cool when I do it?

1066
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:42,286
So let's talk about the future.

1067
01:15:42,453 --> 01:15:45,331
Let's talk about what video means
to this industry.

1068
01:15:45,498 --> 01:15:48,000
And let's talk about how all of us...
Not one of us.

1069
01:15:48,167 --> 01:15:49,877
How all of us are gonna profit.

1070
01:15:50,921 --> 01:15:54,548
I've been doing theater in San Francisco
and San Diego...

1071
01:15:54,716 --> 01:15:57,051
...about as long as
you've been doing stag and hard-core.

1072
01:15:57,219 --> 01:15:59,554
We're all familiar with your biography,
Floyd.

1073
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:02,265
No one is doubting your credentials
or your history.

1074
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:04,307
Then why the resistance?

1075
01:16:04,475 --> 01:16:07,811
I mean, this industry is gonna
be turned upside down soon enough.

1076
01:16:07,979 --> 01:16:11,815
- Why help it?
- Why not be prepared?

1077
01:16:11,984 --> 01:16:14,527
Colonel's got the money.
You got the talent, Jack.

1078
01:16:14,694 --> 01:16:17,613
I got the connection to the equipment
and the mail-order distribution.

1079
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:22,868
Not to mention those kids out there
who are hot fuck action to the max, Jack.

1080
01:16:23,328 --> 01:16:26,747
This is the future.
Videotape tells the truth.

1081
01:16:26,914 --> 01:16:32,837
Wait a minute. You come into my house,
my party, to tell me about the future?

1082
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:36,591
That the future is tape, videotape,
and not film?

1083
01:16:36,757 --> 01:16:40,176
That it's amateurs and not professionals?
I'm a filmmaker.

1084
01:16:40,345 --> 01:16:43,514
That's why I will never make a movie
on videotape.

1085
01:16:43,681 --> 01:16:45,349
And I'll tell you something else.

1086
01:16:45,516 --> 01:16:48,476
I will never, ever loan out
any of the actors...

1087
01:16:48,645 --> 01:16:51,521
- ...that I have under contract to you.
- Wait, wait, wait, Jack.

1088
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:55,109
I'm not a complicated man. I like cinema.

1089
01:16:55,277 --> 01:16:58,029
In particular,
I like to see people fucking on film.

1090
01:16:58,195 --> 01:17:01,198
I don't wanna win an Oscar,
and I don't wanna reinvent the wheel.

1091
01:17:01,365 --> 01:17:05,368
I like simple pleasures like butter
in my ass, lollipops in my mouth.

1092
01:17:05,537 --> 01:17:07,872
That's just me.
That's just something that I enjoy.

1093
01:17:08,039 --> 01:17:09,707
Call me crazy, call me a pervert...

1094
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:12,960
...but there's one little thing
that I wanna do in this life...

1095
01:17:13,127 --> 01:17:17,797
...and that is I wanna make
a dollar and a cent in this business.

1096
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:20,426
Ahh, Jack, I'm not trying to hurt you.

1097
01:17:20,594 --> 01:17:23,554
I'm trying to help you
stay one step ahead of the game.

1098
01:17:24,014 --> 01:17:27,390
We're going in circles now.
We're in familiar territory.

1099
01:17:27,850 --> 01:17:29,976
The territory we're in is the future.

1100
01:17:30,145 --> 01:17:31,354
Not to mention the cost.

1101
01:17:32,355 --> 01:17:35,565
You know, if it looks like shit
and it sounds like shit...

1102
01:17:35,734 --> 01:17:37,275
...then it must be shit.

1103
01:17:37,985 --> 01:17:42,073
You're holding on too tight, Jack.
It doesn't have to look good.

1104
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:44,533
Film is just too damn expensive.

1105
01:17:44,701 --> 01:17:47,703
And the theaters are already converting
to video projectors.

1106
01:17:48,412 --> 01:17:49,913
I haven't heard that.

1107
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:51,916
Well, it's true.

1108
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:56,420
Well...

1109
01:17:58,631 --> 01:18:00,382
Ten minutes before the new year.

1110
01:18:02,677 --> 01:18:04,470
I'd like to spend it with my friends.

1111
01:18:05,096 --> 01:18:08,306
We will or will not continue
this conversation.

1112
01:18:15,273 --> 01:18:17,774
- Hey, Dirk. Ha, ha.
- Hey, Scotty. What's up?

1113
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:19,777
- Fucking New Year's, right?
- 1980.

1114
01:18:19,944 --> 01:18:23,613
- Oh, man, right. Did you see my new car?
- You got a new car?

1115
01:18:23,782 --> 01:18:24,989
- Yeah. Wanna see?
- Yeah.

1116
01:18:25,158 --> 01:18:27,243
All right, cool. It's out front.

1117
01:18:28,119 --> 01:18:29,244
Come on. It's out front.

1118
01:18:29,412 --> 01:18:32,497
Dirk. I want you to meet my friend Todd.
Todd Parker, Dirk Diggler.

1119
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:34,582
- What's up? How are you?
- We finally meet.

1120
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:35,792
- Yeah.
- No.

1121
01:18:35,961 --> 01:18:38,837
I was telling you about him before.
You remember. Todd Parker.

1122
01:18:39,005 --> 01:18:41,923
- He works at Party Boys Strip Club.
- Oh, cool. You're a dancer.

1123
01:18:42,091 --> 01:18:44,926
- Yeah, I got some moves.
- Dirk? Uh...

1124
01:18:45,595 --> 01:18:48,221
I'm sorry. You coming?
Or you wanna talk to these guys...?

1125
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:50,975
Yeah, Scotty. I'll be around in a bit.
We can talk then?

1126
01:18:51,143 --> 01:18:52,435
- Okay.
- See you later, Reed.

1127
01:18:52,601 --> 01:18:54,270
- See you.
- All right.

1128
01:18:56,689 --> 01:19:00,650
Uh, when you get by, uh, the lights,
close your eyes.

1129
01:19:00,819 --> 01:19:01,819
- Okay?
- All right.

1130
01:19:01,987 --> 01:19:04,363
- All right, just follow my voice. All right?
- Yeah.

1131
01:19:04,530 --> 01:19:08,868
Here, here, here.

1132
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:11,328
- Here, here, here.
- Where?

1133
01:19:11,496 --> 01:19:14,457
Keep coming. All right, open them.

1134
01:19:14,623 --> 01:19:16,458
This is it. Ha-ha-ha.

1135
01:19:16,626 --> 01:19:19,295
- It's cool.
- Yeah. You wanna get inside?

1136
01:19:19,462 --> 01:19:21,046
- When did you get this?
- Uh, yesterday.

1137
01:19:21,213 --> 01:19:25,009
Actually, I had it painted yesterday
so the paint might still be kind of sticky.

1138
01:19:25,176 --> 01:19:28,511
- This is great, man. Really great.
- You wanna go for a ride?

1139
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:32,140
Wait, wait, wait. Fuck.
Hell, how much time is left?

1140
01:19:32,850 --> 01:19:35,435
- I'm sorry, Dirk.
- What the hell is the matter with you?

1141
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:38,521
- Why did you do that, Scotty?
- Uh, you look at me sometimes.

1142
01:19:38,689 --> 01:19:40,524
- What?
- I wanted to know if you like me.

1143
01:19:40,692 --> 01:19:43,652
Well, of cour... Uh.
Yeah, I like you, Scotty.

1144
01:19:43,819 --> 01:19:45,863
- Can I kiss you? Please?
- Scotty, I don't...

1145
01:19:46,030 --> 01:19:47,698
- Can I kiss you on the mouth?
- No.

1146
01:19:47,865 --> 01:19:50,117
- Please let me.
- Scotty.

1147
01:19:50,284 --> 01:19:53,537
I'm really sorry. I didn't mean
to grab you like that or scare you.

1148
01:19:53,704 --> 01:19:55,497
- It's all right.
- Do you wanna kiss me?

1149
01:19:55,664 --> 01:19:57,750
- Scotty, wha...?
- No?

1150
01:19:57,917 --> 01:19:59,835
- What is the matter with you?
- Uh, forget it.

1151
01:20:00,002 --> 01:20:04,715
I'm really drunk. Really, I am. I'm just...
I'm out of my head.

1152
01:20:04,882 --> 01:20:07,384
I'm so wa... I'm really wasted.
Really, Dirk.

1153
01:20:07,551 --> 01:20:10,345
- I'm really wasted. I'm crazy right now.
- I understand, man.

1154
01:20:10,514 --> 01:20:13,056
- I'm really crazy, you know?
- Do you wanna go back inside?

1155
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:14,600
Uh...

1156
01:20:14,768 --> 01:20:17,185
- Do you like my car, Dirk?
- What?

1157
01:20:17,354 --> 01:20:19,020
- I mean...
- Yeah. Yeah.

1158
01:20:19,189 --> 01:20:21,064
Because I wanted to, you know...

1159
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:23,442
I wanted to make sure
you thought it was cool...

1160
01:20:23,609 --> 01:20:26,110
...or else I was gonna take it back.

1161
01:20:26,279 --> 01:20:27,822
Oh.

1162
01:20:27,988 --> 01:20:29,573
- Yeah.
- It's great, Scotty.

1163
01:20:29,740 --> 01:20:31,367
Happy New Year.

1164
01:20:31,534 --> 01:20:34,328
- Happy New Year, Scotty.
- I love you. I really love you.

1165
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:36,287
- I love you too, Scotty.
- Okay.

1166
01:20:36,456 --> 01:20:40,708
- All right, let's go back inside, okay?
- All right. All right.

1167
01:20:48,592 --> 01:20:51,011
Fucking idiot.

1168
01:20:51,429 --> 01:20:54,055
I'm a fucking idiot.

1169
01:20:56,141 --> 01:21:09,613
I'm a fucking idiot.

1170
01:21:09,780 --> 01:21:14,201
Fucking idiot. Fucking idiot.
Fucking idiot.

1171
01:21:14,911 --> 01:21:20,957
Jackie. Jackie.
Two minutes, pops. Let's go, let's go.

1172
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:23,918
Whoo!

1173
01:21:24,921 --> 01:21:28,381
Two. Two minutes. Two minutes.

1174
01:21:28,757 --> 01:21:30,301
Come on, Little Bill.

1175
01:21:30,467 --> 01:21:33,929
Okay. Becky, I'm...

1176
01:21:38,643 --> 01:21:41,811
Little Bill. Smile, man. Come here.

1177
01:21:42,439 --> 01:21:44,148
Right, ha, ha.

1178
01:21:47,402 --> 01:21:49,153
I'm so excited.

1179
01:21:52,823 --> 01:21:54,699
Little Bill, champagne?

1180
01:21:54,868 --> 01:21:57,286
- Aw, thanks. That's really nice of you.
- Happy New Year.

1181
01:21:57,453 --> 01:21:58,621
- To you too.
- Okay, man.

1182
01:21:58,787 --> 01:22:00,622
Get some champagne, dude.

1183
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:05,168
No, I'm sorry, I don't have any matches.

1184
01:22:05,337 --> 01:22:07,712
- I got it here, hold on.
- Happy New Year.

1185
01:22:13,261 --> 01:22:14,845
Hey, Kurt, have you seen my wife?

1186
01:22:15,012 --> 01:22:17,221
No, no. Hey, they're doing
that countdown thing.

1187
01:22:17,390 --> 01:22:19,475
- Come on in, man.
- Okay.

1188
01:22:59,515 --> 01:23:02,475
Come on, say something. Make a toast.

1189
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:04,770
Hey, Little Bill, look at me.

1190
01:24:06,498 --> 01:24:11,878
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five...

1191
01:24:12,046 --> 01:24:15,298
...four, three, two...

1192
01:24:18,511 --> 01:24:22,139
- What the fuck was that?
- Where's Jack?

1193
01:24:25,476 --> 01:24:27,310
Where's Jack?

1194
01:24:33,818 --> 01:24:35,694
What about your character Brock Landers...

1195
01:24:35,862 --> 01:24:39,782
...and what some people might consider
violent attitudes towards women?

1196
01:24:40,699 --> 01:24:44,453
Violence? No. What...?

1197
01:24:45,162 --> 01:24:50,708
I mean, if there's a certain amount
of, you know, violence or action...

1198
01:24:50,877 --> 01:24:53,420
...in this series of films,
you know, that's the movie.

1199
01:24:56,548 --> 01:24:59,384
If Brock Landers is slick with a gun...

1200
01:24:59,551 --> 01:25:02,429
...he does so
only in the vein of good and right.

1201
01:25:02,596 --> 01:25:05,390
Brock protects the values
of the American ideal...

1202
01:25:05,557 --> 01:25:10,979
...and fights for causes that instill pride in
a society where morals are hard to come by.

1203
01:25:11,146 --> 01:25:13,856
- Who sent you? Who sent you?
- Get the fuck off me, asshole.

1204
01:25:14,024 --> 01:25:16,859
Lie still! Lie still
or I'll punch you in the goddamn face!

1205
01:25:17,028 --> 01:25:19,195
Fuck off.

1206
01:25:20,405 --> 01:25:21,698
I'll find out who sent you.

1207
01:25:25,662 --> 01:25:31,207
Amber, I live in this world.
I don't like violence any more than you do.

1208
01:25:31,583 --> 01:25:33,668
Violence is a bad thing.

1209
01:25:33,837 --> 01:25:38,422
But when you see violence in films, it's...
You know...

1210
01:25:38,591 --> 01:25:42,552
if movies, films, caused violence...

1211
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:44,720
...we'd be able
to wipe out violence tomorrow.

1212
01:25:44,889 --> 01:25:46,722
Boom, no more films.
That's fine with me.

1213
01:25:46,890 --> 01:25:49,518
I'll find something else to do.
I'll fuck on my own time.

1214
01:25:49,685 --> 01:25:52,229
You know, I got other interests.
I'm a magician.

1215
01:25:52,396 --> 01:25:56,692
Um, and, you know, hopefully, that'll be
something that I focus on in the future.

1216
01:25:56,859 --> 01:26:00,904
Because you can't fuck forever.
I realize that. Anyway, violence...

1217
01:26:01,072 --> 01:26:04,533
...is something that plagues us
as a society.

1218
01:26:05,118 --> 01:26:08,578
Well, the fine line is
I'm playing a character.

1219
01:26:08,746 --> 01:26:10,997
You know, I mean, I'm Dirk Diggler.

1220
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,418
Brock Landers
is a character that I'm playing.

1221
01:26:16,087 --> 01:26:18,671
I'm gonna ask you once more,
and I'm gonna ask you nice.

1222
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:20,798
Where the fuck is Ringo, you bitch?

1223
01:26:21,216 --> 01:26:22,717
Fuck you.

1224
01:26:22,886 --> 01:26:23,926
Oh!

1225
01:26:24,095 --> 01:26:26,180
- Uh, why do I love him?
- Yeah.

1226
01:26:26,346 --> 01:26:28,681
He's, uh... He's very special.

1227
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:32,476
And, um, he can fuck hard
or he can fuck, like, really gently.

1228
01:26:32,645 --> 01:26:34,395
He's the best.

1229
01:26:34,564 --> 01:26:39,693
Uh, I think that's part of my reason
for doing this, you know?

1230
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:42,529
I've gotten thousands
upon thousands of letters...

1231
01:26:42,697 --> 01:26:44,405
...you know, from people telling me:

1232
01:26:44,573 --> 01:26:48,618
"God, you've taught me this and
you've made our love life so much better."

1233
01:26:48,786 --> 01:26:51,622
And this isn't "Go out and have sex
with 10 million people."

1234
01:26:51,788 --> 01:26:55,458
And, you know, "How to get a girl off."
It's about how to get your wife off.

1235
01:26:55,627 --> 01:26:57,961
If only people
could have been doing this before...

1236
01:26:58,128 --> 01:27:00,505
...we could have saved
a million relationships.

1237
01:27:00,672 --> 01:27:02,256
You know, I've saved thousands.

1238
01:27:02,425 --> 01:27:05,260
Blocking, an idea or a movement.

1239
01:27:05,427 --> 01:27:09,972
Jack will put the final touches together
for what the camera needs for editing...

1240
01:27:10,140 --> 01:27:13,185
...but, you know, he allows me
to block my own sex scenes...

1241
01:27:13,353 --> 01:27:17,230
...and, you know, gives me the freedom to
develop the character and stuff like that.

1242
01:27:17,398 --> 01:27:19,899
God, ha, ha, I don't know any other,
you know, director...

1243
01:27:20,068 --> 01:27:24,695
...who would let an actor,
you know, do that, heh. You know?

1244
01:27:24,863 --> 01:27:29,701
Ha-ha-ha. I don't allow him
to block his own sex scenes.

1245
01:27:30,078 --> 01:27:32,328
It is. It's jealousy.

1246
01:27:32,497 --> 01:27:37,042
It's deceitfulness. It's vindictiveness.
It's all of that stuff, you know?

1247
01:27:37,210 --> 01:27:40,295
But, I mean, God, what can you expect
when you're on top, you know?

1248
01:27:40,462 --> 01:27:43,172
It's like Napoleon.
When he was the king...

1249
01:27:43,341 --> 01:27:46,092
...you know, people were constantly
trying to conquer him...

1250
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:48,345
...you know, in the Roman Empire.

1251
01:27:49,346 --> 01:27:51,847
So it's history repeating itself
all over again.

1252
01:27:52,015 --> 01:27:55,351
To all the critics out there,
I know they're gonna be reviewing this...

1253
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:57,520
...and I know
they're gonna try to knock me.

1254
01:27:57,689 --> 01:28:01,190
I just want them to know... Is it okay
if I say this into the camera, Amber?

1255
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:03,025
Okay.

1256
01:28:03,528 --> 01:28:06,154
I only am who I am
because I was born that way.

1257
01:28:06,322 --> 01:28:11,033
I have a gift, and I am trying
to not be selfish about it, but to use it.

1258
01:28:11,202 --> 01:28:15,372
Okay? And if you wanna knock me for that,
it's your own problem, okay?

1259
01:28:15,539 --> 01:28:17,916
Jealousy will get you nowhere.

1260
01:28:19,167 --> 01:28:20,418
I'm gonna keep rocking on.

1261
01:28:21,878 --> 01:28:23,380
For Dirk Diggler...

1262
01:28:23,547 --> 01:28:27,384
...the future is something
to look forward to, not to fear.

1263
01:28:27,551 --> 01:28:29,927
He is a creative man of many interests:

1264
01:28:30,095 --> 01:28:34,181
Film, poetry, karate, music, and dance.

1265
01:28:34,350 --> 01:28:37,226
He is a man of passion and mystery.

1266
01:28:37,395 --> 01:28:39,645
He is a man of lust.

1267
01:28:49,239 --> 01:28:52,408
- It's my poem to you.
- It's good, Amber. It's really good.

1268
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:55,578
You're like a director now.
So have you shown Jack yet?

1269
01:28:55,747 --> 01:28:58,247
No, just you. I wanted you to be the first.

1270
01:28:58,416 --> 01:29:00,751
- It's really good, Amber. Congratulations.
- Thanks.

1271
01:29:00,917 --> 01:29:02,836
- Thanks, baby.
- Wow.

1272
01:29:03,003 --> 01:29:05,921
Um, the only thing I was wondering is...

1273
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:08,759
You might think about cutting that part
where Jack talks...

1274
01:29:08,926 --> 01:29:10,385
- About blocking the sex?
- Yeah.

1275
01:29:11,595 --> 01:29:14,096
That stuff about me
not being a black belt is not true.

1276
01:29:14,265 --> 01:29:16,515
Yeah. I can fix that.

1277
01:29:16,850 --> 01:29:18,560
- Ace of spades.
- How did it turn out?

1278
01:29:20,063 --> 01:29:21,896
- Are you sure?
- No.

1279
01:29:22,064 --> 01:29:23,774
- Shit.
- Hello?

1280
01:29:23,940 --> 01:29:26,943
- Hey, how was it, man?
- What?

1281
01:29:27,110 --> 01:29:29,029
Really? I bet. You're so good.

1282
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:32,532
- Look, slow... Slow down. Slow down.
- You'll have to show it to me.

1283
01:29:32,699 --> 01:29:38,454
Guys, guys, guys.
Slow down, Colonel. Say again?

1284
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:44,336
I'll be right there.

1285
01:29:53,304 --> 01:29:54,637
So...?

1286
01:29:54,805 --> 01:29:57,599
Well, let me tell you, Jack, ha, ha.

1287
01:29:58,725 --> 01:30:05,314
I mean, I don't mean to laugh about it,
but she was 15 going on 150, believe me.

1288
01:30:05,483 --> 01:30:08,150
She was... You would never know it.
Never know.

1289
01:30:08,319 --> 01:30:11,904
I mean, I was fooled completely.
I mean, I've had a few of them.

1290
01:30:12,073 --> 01:30:13,114
Anyhow...

1291
01:30:14,699 --> 01:30:16,993
You do believe me, don't you, Jack?

1292
01:30:17,161 --> 01:30:18,662
Yeah, I believe you.

1293
01:30:18,829 --> 01:30:22,998
Anyway, so I take her home, Jack,
you know, and I got her there...

1294
01:30:23,167 --> 01:30:25,167
...and I tell her not to do so much coke...

1295
01:30:25,336 --> 01:30:28,671
...but she must have done 20 lines
of this stuff in, like, 5 minutes.

1296
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:31,173
It's like a vacuum in her nose.
And there's only...

1297
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:33,551
Just going up like crazy.

1298
01:30:33,719 --> 01:30:37,721
Anyway, she's got all this stuff going up,
and the next thing you know, she started...

1299
01:30:37,890 --> 01:30:41,100
Something must have broken up there,
blood poured all over the place.

1300
01:30:41,269 --> 01:30:44,604
All over the sheets and everything.
Just... pouring out.

1301
01:30:44,771 --> 01:30:47,649
- Oh, Jack. Oh, God.
- All right.

1302
01:30:47,817 --> 01:30:50,860
You thought she was older.
You... You didn't do anything.

1303
01:30:51,028 --> 01:30:55,073
She was just at the... She was at your
place. You didn't do anything, right?

1304
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:56,783
- Nothing.
- You didn't do anything?

1305
01:30:56,951 --> 01:30:59,703
- You know me. I didn't do a thing.
- You didn't do anything?

1306
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:02,997
- No, I didn't do anything.
- All right, nothing.

1307
01:31:06,961 --> 01:31:08,795
But they, uh...

1308
01:31:09,881 --> 01:31:12,256
They found something at the house.

1309
01:31:14,426 --> 01:31:17,136
- What?
- There's something that's...

1310
01:31:19,724 --> 01:31:23,476
Jack, it's my fucking weakness, Jack.

1311
01:31:23,644 --> 01:31:27,146
It's just, they're so small, and they're
so cute and they're so adorable.

1312
01:31:27,314 --> 01:31:30,065
- I just can't help it when they're so cute...
- Jesus Christ.

1313
01:31:30,234 --> 01:31:32,777
No, no, Jack. Listen, listen.
I don't touch them, Jack.

1314
01:31:32,944 --> 01:31:37,407
I don't touch them in any way, honestly.
Jack, please.

1315
01:31:37,617 --> 01:31:39,201
All right.

1316
01:31:40,994 --> 01:31:44,747
Tsk. Well, now you think I'm an asshole.

1317
01:31:46,167 --> 01:31:51,087
Jack, let me tell you this.
I love you, Jack. I'm your friend.

1318
01:31:51,255 --> 01:31:54,173
There's one thing I want you to do, though.
Tell me...

1319
01:31:54,341 --> 01:31:57,469
Jack, come on.
Tell me that you're my friend.

1320
01:31:57,886 --> 01:32:00,387
Just tell me. Am I your friend? Am l...?

1321
01:32:05,728 --> 01:32:06,770
Jack?

1322
01:32:08,605 --> 01:32:10,148
Jack?

1323
01:32:11,108 --> 01:32:14,069
Jack, Jack, am I your friend?

1324
01:32:14,237 --> 01:32:19,157
Just tell me. Am I?
Just tell me, Jack. Am I your friend?

1325
01:32:25,581 --> 01:32:27,666
- I do.
- I do too.

1326
01:32:33,171 --> 01:32:35,047
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1327
01:32:40,805 --> 01:32:44,306
Listen, I'm... I'm dying...

1328
01:32:45,059 --> 01:32:47,476
- I'm dying to do a movie with you.
- I know you are.

1329
01:32:47,645 --> 01:32:49,938
I mean,
it's such an important thing in my life.

1330
01:32:50,105 --> 01:32:52,148
I spoke to Jack...

1331
01:32:54,318 --> 01:32:56,319
Oh, man. I just...

1332
01:32:56,487 --> 01:32:58,697
- I'll tell you what comes to mind.
- Yeah?

1333
01:32:58,863 --> 01:33:02,117
What comes to mind is
I am the ultimate Latin lover.

1334
01:33:02,284 --> 01:33:05,787
- I've never been to Las Vegas.
- There is no Latin lover like me, understand?

1335
01:33:05,954 --> 01:33:07,788
Once you get Maurice as the Latin lover...

1336
01:33:07,957 --> 01:33:09,832
Have you ever been to, um, Niagara Falls?

1337
01:33:10,001 --> 01:33:12,668
- I've been to Las Vegas.
- That is great. That's so great.

1338
01:33:12,837 --> 01:33:16,006
This is gonna be a great opportunity for me
to run the store my way.

1339
01:33:16,172 --> 01:33:18,341
- Just to get those guys off my back.
- Exactly.

1340
01:33:18,509 --> 01:33:21,176
- Hello? Champagne.
- I'll run the store my way.

1341
01:33:21,345 --> 01:33:24,430
- You...? Are you guys moving to Bakersfield?
- Did you find a house?

1342
01:33:24,599 --> 01:33:25,681
- Yeah.
- Soon?

1343
01:33:25,850 --> 01:33:27,975
- I know... l once lived in Bakersfield.
- Yeah?

1344
01:33:28,144 --> 01:33:31,145
Hey, guys, we're losing these two.
They're moving to Bakersfield.

1345
01:33:31,314 --> 01:33:34,149
- Did you like it there?
- Big promotion.

1346
01:33:34,442 --> 01:33:36,859
They look at the movies and say,
"Hell, I can do that."

1347
01:33:37,028 --> 01:33:39,570
- I can do it.
- It's more complicated than that.

1348
01:33:39,738 --> 01:33:41,614
- It's a tough racket, actually.
- Right.

1349
01:33:41,782 --> 01:33:43,992
Hey, Dirk, you made it.

1350
01:33:44,368 --> 01:33:46,368
- Hey, Jack.
- How you doing?

1351
01:33:46,537 --> 01:33:48,954
Good. Who's that?

1352
01:33:49,122 --> 01:33:51,373
Hi. I'm Johnny Doe.

1353
01:33:51,542 --> 01:33:53,917
You're Dirk Diggler.

1354
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:58,172
It's great to meet you.

1355
01:33:59,884 --> 01:34:02,926
Johnny's, uh, the new boy on the street.

1356
01:34:03,095 --> 01:34:06,055
He's interested in, uh, show business.

1357
01:34:12,063 --> 01:34:13,771
He's very tired.

1358
01:34:13,939 --> 01:34:17,984
And, uh, he's shy, you know?

1359
01:34:19,362 --> 01:34:22,947
So like I said, it's a tough...
It's a tough business.

1360
01:34:23,114 --> 01:34:24,615
You got a great kisser...

1361
01:34:24,783 --> 01:34:30,412
...but, you know, there's a lot of work
involved, a lot of people.

1362
01:34:30,581 --> 01:34:33,041
We all have to work our buns off.
Know what I mean?

1363
01:34:33,208 --> 01:34:38,421
I mean, it takes 15, 16 guys
just to do the lighting.

1364
01:34:40,006 --> 01:34:42,550
No, no, no. It's crystal, man.
You just wanna do bumps.

1365
01:34:42,717 --> 01:34:46,470
- Shut up, man.
- All right.

1366
01:34:46,930 --> 01:34:48,681
Hey, you guys.

1367
01:34:49,140 --> 01:34:50,641
What?

1368
01:34:50,810 --> 01:34:53,728
- Just saying hey.
- Yeah, whatever.

1369
01:34:54,604 --> 01:34:56,439
Oh, man.

1370
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:59,317
- Oh!
- You all right?

1371
01:34:59,484 --> 01:35:03,320
- It's fucking getting me fucking high, man.
- Yeah. It's that carpet dope.

1372
01:35:04,739 --> 01:35:07,033
It's the kind of dope
they used to put carpet in.

1373
01:35:07,201 --> 01:35:10,787
You know, they'd mix it up in the bathtub
and while they were mixing it up...

1374
01:35:10,954 --> 01:35:13,957
...they'd drop in a hunk of carpet into it.

1375
01:35:15,292 --> 01:35:16,626
Ow!

1376
01:35:16,793 --> 01:35:20,505
It's a lot better than that pink shit,
I tell you. The pink shit's fucking weird.

1377
01:35:20,672 --> 01:35:22,756
They put fish scales in that shit.

1378
01:35:34,145 --> 01:35:35,811
Fuck.

1379
01:35:44,529 --> 01:35:47,657
You look good. You ready?

1380
01:35:47,824 --> 01:35:49,658
You ready?

1381
01:35:56,917 --> 01:35:58,835
Come on.

1382
01:36:01,505 --> 01:36:04,506
I am a star.
I'm a fucking rock 'n' roll star, man.

1383
01:36:04,675 --> 01:36:06,842
My cock can get hard. Come on. Fuck.

1384
01:36:07,011 --> 01:36:10,471
Please don't do this to me.
No, please. Come on.

1385
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:13,515
I'm a star. I am...

1386
01:36:19,023 --> 01:36:21,565
Again. You ready?

1387
01:36:23,068 --> 01:36:24,985
I'm born ready.

1388
01:36:25,570 --> 01:36:27,197
Come on.

1389
01:36:29,699 --> 01:36:31,743
- What?
- It's just there's a thing there...

1390
01:36:31,911 --> 01:36:33,368
- No.
- That'll work.

1391
01:36:33,537 --> 01:36:34,953
- Jack.
- Yeah?

1392
01:36:35,122 --> 01:36:36,872
I'm ready to shoot.

1393
01:36:37,457 --> 01:36:40,918
- Uh, 20 minutes, huh?
- No. I'm ready now. It's gotta be now.

1394
01:36:41,086 --> 01:36:42,252
Twenty minutes, babe.

1395
01:36:42,421 --> 01:36:46,256
Fuck it. Hey, no. Hey, Jack.
I'm ready to shoot now.

1396
01:36:46,425 --> 01:36:49,010
My cock is ready. I wanna fuck. Let's go.

1397
01:36:49,177 --> 01:36:50,636
Twenty minutes.

1398
01:36:50,805 --> 01:36:53,389
- I wanna fuck. Who's it gonna be?
- What?

1399
01:36:53,556 --> 01:36:55,850
Who do you want to start fucking?
Me or him?

1400
01:36:56,018 --> 01:36:57,060
- What?
- Shut up, okay?

1401
01:36:57,228 --> 01:37:00,145
- I didn't do anything to you.
- What? You're not even an actor.

1402
01:37:00,314 --> 01:37:02,940
- You got no business being here.
- Knock this shit off.

1403
01:37:03,108 --> 01:37:04,234
- Yes, I am.
- No, no.

1404
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:07,069
- I'm an actor. I'm a real fucking actor.
- Shut up.

1405
01:37:07,238 --> 01:37:08,404
- What?
- Hey, come on.

1406
01:37:08,572 --> 01:37:09,823
- Shut up.
- No.

1407
01:37:09,989 --> 01:37:12,699
Stop this Mickey Mouse bullshit.
I want you to go in there.

1408
01:37:12,868 --> 01:37:16,078
I want you to cool off, okay?

1409
01:37:16,247 --> 01:37:18,957
Just cool off and we'll come back
and shoot the scene.

1410
01:37:19,123 --> 01:37:21,501
- I said, I'm ready to shoot.
- Not now.

1411
01:37:21,668 --> 01:37:24,127
I'm not gonna tell you again, Jack.

1412
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:26,672
I'm not gonna shoot you
in the state you're in.

1413
01:37:26,841 --> 01:37:29,341
What do you mean, "state"?
State? State of California?

1414
01:37:29,510 --> 01:37:32,595
- I know where the fuck I am, Jack.
- You've been up for two days.

1415
01:37:32,762 --> 01:37:34,430
No, I haven't been up for two days.

1416
01:37:34,597 --> 01:37:37,100
Nevertheless,
you look like you haven't been to sleep.

1417
01:37:37,268 --> 01:37:40,603
So I ain't gonna shoot you this way
because you don't look good.

1418
01:37:40,770 --> 01:37:42,980
You know what?
You don't tell me anything, okay?

1419
01:37:43,148 --> 01:37:44,983
- Really?
- You're not the boss of me.

1420
01:37:45,149 --> 01:37:46,609
- Yes, I am.
- Oh, you're the king, huh?

1421
01:37:46,777 --> 01:37:48,569
- Yes!
- Don't you fucking touch me, man!

1422
01:37:48,737 --> 01:37:51,363
- Dirk, honey...
- No, no. No. You shut up too.

1423
01:37:51,532 --> 01:37:53,992
You're not the mother of me
and you're not my boss.

1424
01:37:54,158 --> 01:37:55,952
- You're not my fucking mom.
- Hey, man...

1425
01:37:56,119 --> 01:37:57,703
- Dirk, honey...
- I'll take you home.

1426
01:37:57,872 --> 01:38:01,875
No, no. I'm ready to shoot the scene.
I wanna shoot the scene. I'm fine.

1427
01:38:02,042 --> 01:38:03,542
I want you out of here.

1428
01:38:03,711 --> 01:38:07,588
- Look, it's over, okay? I'm done.
- Listen to me, kid. I want you...

1429
01:38:07,756 --> 01:38:09,591
- Don't you fucking call me a kid.
- What?

1430
01:38:09,757 --> 01:38:13,386
I'll fuck you up. You wanna see me
kick some ass? I know fucking karate.

1431
01:38:13,554 --> 01:38:16,221
- You're fucking fired! You are fired!
- Come on, come on.

1432
01:38:16,390 --> 01:38:19,016
- You're fired, you goddamn kid!
- What is that? What is that?

1433
01:38:19,184 --> 01:38:21,019
- Jack! Jack!
- Jack, Jack, Jack.

1434
01:38:21,185 --> 01:38:23,938
No, no, no. You know what?
I'm the biggest star here, man.

1435
01:38:24,105 --> 01:38:26,106
That's the way it is.

1436
01:38:26,274 --> 01:38:30,737
I wanna fuck. It's my big dick.
So everybody get ready fucking now!

1437
01:38:32,614 --> 01:38:35,324
You know what? Here.
I don't need this shit.

1438
01:38:35,492 --> 01:38:38,036
You know, fuck you! Fuck you!
Fuck all of you!

1439
01:38:38,203 --> 01:38:40,329
You're not my boss!
You're not the king of me!

1440
01:38:40,497 --> 01:38:42,372
I am the fucking king of Dirk!

1441
01:38:42,541 --> 01:38:45,627
You're nothing without me, Jack.
You're fucking nothing. Fuck this.

1442
01:38:45,793 --> 01:38:47,502
- I don't need this shit.
- Dirk, wait.

1443
01:38:47,671 --> 01:38:49,756
- Fuck this.
- I'm so sorry, Jack. I'm so sorry.

1444
01:38:49,923 --> 01:38:52,591
I'm gonna take care of this.
I'm gonna straighten him out.

1445
01:39:07,733 --> 01:39:09,317
Okay, Dirk, you ready?

1446
01:39:09,484 --> 01:39:11,485
Yeah. I was born ready, Nick.
Let's go, man.

1447
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:14,154
- Dirk Diggler demo.
- Keep the vocals up.

1448
01:39:14,323 --> 01:39:17,033
"You Got the Touch," take seven.

1449
01:39:17,868 --> 01:39:19,368
Excuse me, Reed.

1450
01:39:19,536 --> 01:39:22,037
Oh, heh. Oops.

You think the bass
is taking away from the vocal?

1464
01:40:22,349 --> 01:40:26,435
No, not really. Maybe.
It sounds balanced to me.

1465
01:40:26,603 --> 01:40:28,604
It's definitely taking away from my vocal.

1466
01:40:28,771 --> 01:40:31,440
Just take the bass down
and bring up the vocals.

1467
01:40:31,608 --> 01:40:34,234
Okay, let's do it, Nick. You heard him.

1468
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:36,445
You wanna take it from the top?

1469
01:40:36,613 --> 01:40:39,114

01:41:39,134 --> 01:41:41,802
- Let's lay it down. Nick?
- You wanna lay it down?

1486
01:41:41,970 --> 01:41:43,554
Were we rolling on that rehearsal?

1487
01:41:43,721 --> 01:41:46,515
Is he gonna fuck me in the ass?

1488
01:41:46,682 --> 01:41:49,685
- Ls that what you want?
- Lt would be nice.

1489
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:52,063
Fuck her in the ass.

1490
01:41:52,855 --> 01:41:54,398
Lock and load, Jack.

1491
01:42:02,115 --> 01:42:04,574
I was gonna take a pottery class
at Everywoman's Village.

1492
01:42:04,743 --> 01:42:07,036
- Oh, I wanna do that.
- Okay, we'll do that.

1493
01:42:07,203 --> 01:42:09,162
Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays at 3.

1494
01:42:09,331 --> 01:42:11,791
- I was thinking something.
- What?

1495
01:42:12,333 --> 01:42:14,918
I was gonna see about taking the GED.
Do you know what that is?

1496
01:42:15,087 --> 01:42:18,588
- Mm-hm, for high school, to graduate.
- It's because I never got my diploma.

1497
01:42:18,756 --> 01:42:22,009
I feel bad, you know, that, uh...
I think you were right about that.

1498
01:42:22,176 --> 01:42:25,137
You should do it, Rollergirl,
because you know what?

1499
01:42:25,305 --> 01:42:28,015
If you wanted to, you could do anything.

1500
01:42:33,939 --> 01:42:36,064
- Mr. Swope.
- Yes. That's me. Yes.

1501
01:42:36,233 --> 01:42:38,525
- You have your loan application?
- Yes, I do. Right there.

1502
01:42:38,694 --> 01:42:40,778
- Good. You wanna follow me?
- Yes, I do.

1503
01:42:41,238 --> 01:42:44,407
Hey, Kurt, are we gonna
have any more coverage on this, or...?

1504
01:42:44,574 --> 01:42:46,826
No, no. We just keep shooting.
This is video.

1505
01:42:46,993 --> 01:42:49,494
We shoot and shoot,
and then we deal with it later.

1506
01:42:49,662 --> 01:42:52,414
All right, now, Summer,
I want you to take Skye's thong off.

1507
01:42:52,582 --> 01:42:55,960
That thong thing. Yeah, actually take
it off. That's good. And finger it.

1508
01:42:56,127 --> 01:42:57,920
Oh, that's good. Lick the thong. Yeah.

1509
01:42:58,087 --> 01:43:00,506
You know,
that's really good technically, but...

1510
01:43:00,673 --> 01:43:03,509
But it lacks passion.
I wanna see some passion here.

1511
01:43:03,676 --> 01:43:05,094
Yes, bitch!

1512
01:43:06,721 --> 01:43:08,597
Yeah, that's it.

1513
01:43:09,182 --> 01:43:10,474
Lick my balls.

1514
01:43:11,225 --> 01:43:12,310
Fuck me.

1515
01:43:14,354 --> 01:43:15,688
Who's your daddy, bitch?

1516
01:43:16,731 --> 01:43:20,400
You live. You live. Yes!

1517
01:43:22,695 --> 01:43:24,404
I'm back.

1518
01:43:24,823 --> 01:43:25,864
Perfect timing.

1519
01:43:27,618 --> 01:43:28,658
I'm back.

1520
01:43:30,787 --> 01:43:32,913
- What the fuck took you so long, man?
- Todd.

1521
01:43:43,466 --> 01:43:44,507
Fuck.

1522
01:43:44,676 --> 01:43:48,554
That's really what Buck's Super Stereo World
is all about. It's about the customer.

1523
01:43:48,721 --> 01:43:51,306
People wanna know
what they're getting into technically.

1524
01:43:51,475 --> 01:43:53,809
I have the specific
technical hi-fi background...

1525
01:43:53,976 --> 01:43:56,186
...to answer any question
somebody's gonna have.

1526
01:43:56,354 --> 01:43:58,689
I've been in sound equipment
long enough to know...

1527
01:43:58,856 --> 01:44:01,317
...what a guy wants
when he walks through that door.

1528
01:44:01,484 --> 01:44:05,029
That's the kind of personal touch
Buck's Super Stereo World's gonna have.

1529
01:44:09,659 --> 01:44:14,829
I miss my two sons, you know.
I miss my little Andrew and... And my Dirk.

1530
01:44:14,997 --> 01:44:18,626
You know,
I always felt like Dirk was my baby.

1531
01:44:18,793 --> 01:44:20,086
My new baby.

1532
01:44:20,503 --> 01:44:23,797
- Don't you miss Dirk?
- Yeah.

1533
01:44:23,966 --> 01:44:27,592
He's so fucking talented, the bastard.
You know, I just...

1534
01:44:29,637 --> 01:44:34,225
I love him, Rollergirl. I mean, I
really love the stupid jerk, ha, ha.

1535
01:44:35,935 --> 01:44:37,979
I love you, Mom.

1536
01:44:38,188 --> 01:44:41,064
I want you to be my mom, Amber.
Are you my mom?

1537
01:44:41,524 --> 01:44:44,652
I'll just...
I'll ask you if you're my mom, okay?

1538
01:44:44,819 --> 01:44:47,697
And you say yes, okay?
Are you my mom?

1539
01:44:48,323 --> 01:44:49,573
Yes, honey.

1540
01:44:49,740 --> 01:44:53,077
- Ha.
- Yes. Yes.

1541
01:44:54,662 --> 01:44:57,372
- Don't try...
- Hold on. Come on, come on, all right?

1542
01:44:57,541 --> 01:44:59,750
All we need is the tapes, Burt.

1543
01:44:59,917 --> 01:45:02,295
No. You don't get them until you pay.

1544
01:45:02,462 --> 01:45:04,963
In our situation,
that doesn't make any fucking sense!

1545
01:45:05,131 --> 01:45:07,507
Wait. We can't pay
the price of the demo tapes...

1546
01:45:07,676 --> 01:45:11,136
...unless we take the demo tapes
to the record company and get paid!

1547
01:45:11,305 --> 01:45:13,346
Hello? Exactly.

1548
01:45:13,724 --> 01:45:17,560
That's not an MP.
That's a YP. "Your problem."

1549
01:45:17,728 --> 01:45:20,563
Come up with the money
and I'll give you the tapes. That's it.

1550
01:45:20,730 --> 01:45:24,190
Okay, now you're talking above my head.
I don't know this industry jargon.

1551
01:45:24,359 --> 01:45:25,734
YP, MP. Whatever, okay?

1552
01:45:25,902 --> 01:45:28,487
All I know is that
I cannot get a record contract...

1553
01:45:28,654 --> 01:45:31,865
We cannot get a record contract
unless I take these tapes...

1554
01:45:32,033 --> 01:45:34,034
And granted,
the tapes themselves are your...

1555
01:45:34,202 --> 01:45:37,078
Are your busi... Are your...
You own them, okay?

1556
01:45:37,247 --> 01:45:40,916
But the magic that is on the tapes,
that fucking heart and soul...

1557
01:45:41,083 --> 01:45:44,377
...that we put into those tapes,
that is ours, and you don't own that.

1558
01:45:44,546 --> 01:45:47,922
Now, I need to take that magic
and get it to the record company.

1559
01:45:48,091 --> 01:45:50,967
They're waiting. We were supposed
to be there a half-hour ago.

1560
01:45:51,136 --> 01:45:54,262
We look like assholes right now, man.

1561
01:46:00,729 --> 01:46:04,564
I don't wanna do this anymore, honey.
I can't. I just... Let's have fun now.

1562
01:46:04,733 --> 01:46:08,319
Let's just go and go and go,
because it's over.

1563
01:46:08,487 --> 01:46:12,280
There's too many things. Too many things.
Too many things. Too many things.

1564
01:46:12,448 --> 01:46:15,117
- Okay.
- Let's go walk.

1565
01:46:15,284 --> 01:46:18,412
- I don't wanna leave this room.
- Me either, ha, ha.

1566
01:46:19,247 --> 01:46:20,663
I love you, honey.

1567
01:46:20,832 --> 01:46:22,625
- I love you, Mom.
- Aah!

1568
01:46:22,792 --> 01:46:26,962
Let me explain to him in simple arithmetic.
One, two, three.

1569
01:46:27,130 --> 01:46:31,132
Because you don't fucking get it, Burt.
You give us the tapes.

1570
01:46:31,301 --> 01:46:34,761
We get the record contract. We come back
and give you your fucking money.

1571
01:46:34,930 --> 01:46:37,014
Have you heard the tapes?
Have you heard them?

1572
01:46:37,181 --> 01:46:39,725
We're guaranteed a record deal.
Our stuff is that good!

1573
01:46:39,893 --> 01:46:42,853
Okay, now I got it. I got it.
Now I understand.

1574
01:46:43,020 --> 01:46:46,481
I know you want it to happen,
but it's not gonna happen...

1575
01:46:46,649 --> 01:46:49,734
...because it's a Catch-22, and that's it.

1576
01:46:49,903 --> 01:46:52,445
What the fuck does that mean?
What is a Catch-22, Burt?

1577
01:46:52,613 --> 01:46:55,448
- Aah.
- Twenty-two, gentlemen. Think about it.

1578
01:46:57,118 --> 01:46:59,203
- You know what I'm thinking about, man?
- No, Dirk!

1579
01:46:59,371 --> 01:47:01,956
I'm thinking about
kicking some fucking ass in here!

1580
01:47:02,123 --> 01:47:03,541
Scotty, get him out of here.

1581
01:47:03,707 --> 01:47:07,336
Thanks a lot for backing us up too.
Real good.

1582
01:47:08,505 --> 01:47:09,712
Fuck.

1583
01:47:14,219 --> 01:47:16,595
- Mr. Swope.
- Yes.

1584
01:47:17,847 --> 01:47:19,472
We can't help you.

1585
01:47:22,185 --> 01:47:26,146
I have all the papers, though. I mean,
every... Everything's in order, yes?

1586
01:47:26,314 --> 01:47:30,400
Yes, yes, but we can't give you a loan.
I'm sorry.

1587
01:47:30,569 --> 01:47:31,985
- Why?
- I don't understand. Why?

1588
01:47:32,154 --> 01:47:33,863
Yeah, why can't you give me the loan?

1589
01:47:35,990 --> 01:47:37,867
Mr. Swope, you're a pornographer.

1590
01:47:38,033 --> 01:47:40,493
This bank is not in business
to support pornography.

1591
01:47:40,662 --> 01:47:43,413
Okay, I'm not a pornographer, though.
I'm an actor.

1592
01:47:43,582 --> 01:47:45,248
- I'm sorry.
- Please, please.

1593
01:47:45,417 --> 01:47:48,836
Now, this is a new business for me.

1594
01:47:49,003 --> 01:47:55,009
All right? It's a real thing that I wanna do.
It's a real thing that I can do. Please.

1595
01:47:55,551 --> 01:47:57,470
- I'm sorry.
- Well, we did everything right.

1596
01:47:57,636 --> 01:47:59,971
Okay, honey, it's okay.
Just wait a minute, wait a minute.

1597
01:48:00,140 --> 01:48:03,016
Now, let's just take a minute, okay?
Um...

1598
01:48:03,726 --> 01:48:06,854
Look, you have something to say.
I have something to say, all right?

1599
01:48:07,021 --> 01:48:09,230
So let's just talk, okay?

1600
01:48:09,399 --> 01:48:12,568
If there is something
that I didn't fill out correctly on this...

1601
01:48:12,735 --> 01:48:16,488
...or if there is something I left out,
or maybe you want me to write on there...

1602
01:48:16,655 --> 01:48:19,617
...just tell me what to write on there.
I'll write it on there.

1603
01:48:19,909 --> 01:48:21,702
I'm sorry.

1604
01:48:24,413 --> 01:48:27,457
You're not being fair. This isn't fair.

1605
01:48:27,626 --> 01:48:30,877
This financial institution
cannot endorse pornography.

1606
01:48:31,046 --> 01:48:33,463
Stop saying that!
Will you quit saying "pornography"?

1607
01:48:33,631 --> 01:48:37,717
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Please. Now, please. I'm sorry.

1608
01:48:40,095 --> 01:48:43,890
I'm an... l am an ac... I am an actor.

1609
01:48:48,145 --> 01:48:49,438
Come on.

1610
01:49:15,966 --> 01:49:18,801
- That guy wants that thing for the thing...
- You fix it up.

1611
01:49:32,649 --> 01:49:34,483
Who's your daddy?

1612
01:49:34,650 --> 01:49:37,528
- How is it?
- What it is, what it is.

1613
01:49:37,695 --> 01:49:39,320
Yeah.

1614
01:49:41,365 --> 01:49:43,867
Suck that cock, bitch.

1615
01:49:57,923 --> 01:50:00,466
- Hello. You must be Maggie.
- Yes.

1616
01:50:00,635 --> 01:50:03,886
- Kathleen O'Malley. I'm the judge.
- Yes.

1617
01:50:06,181 --> 01:50:09,018
- You have a lawyer with you?
- No, I don't.

1618
01:50:09,185 --> 01:50:11,020
I do not.

1619
01:50:27,871 --> 01:50:30,872
- Hello, judge.
- Morning, counselor.

1620
01:50:51,810 --> 01:50:53,520
You've been divorced for six years?

1621
01:50:53,688 --> 01:50:56,314
Yes, since 1977.

1622
01:50:56,483 --> 01:51:00,027
And the agreement on the money settlement
has been taken care of?

1623
01:51:00,944 --> 01:51:02,570
Yes.

1624
01:51:02,988 --> 01:51:07,868
So, what we're talking about then is coming
to an agreement on the custody of...

1625
01:51:08,036 --> 01:51:09,994
- Of "Andrew."
- Yes.

1626
01:51:11,747 --> 01:51:14,248
Oh, what was decided during the divorce?

1627
01:51:14,417 --> 01:51:17,961
Well, initially, uh,
Andrew was to go with his father...

1628
01:51:18,128 --> 01:51:20,463
...with a visitation with his mother...

1629
01:51:20,631 --> 01:51:25,636
...uh, from, uh,
Saturday noon to Sunday at 7...

1630
01:51:25,804 --> 01:51:31,265
...with his mother entitled to bring Andrew
to her house or any reasonable place.

1631
01:51:31,434 --> 01:51:34,228
- Was that the understanding?
- Yes.

1632
01:51:34,729 --> 01:51:37,146
Why wasn't that visiting privilege
honored, then?

1633
01:51:37,314 --> 01:51:40,734
- It was for a while.
- I only saw him twice.

1634
01:51:40,902 --> 01:51:43,904
It said "reasonable place."

1635
01:51:44,072 --> 01:51:48,449
I didn't think that a house of prostitution
and drugs and pornography was that.

1636
01:51:48,618 --> 01:51:50,159
I'm sorry?

1637
01:51:50,328 --> 01:51:53,663
My wife is in the pornography business.

1638
01:51:54,457 --> 01:51:56,750
I didn't think that environment
was safe for my son.

1639
01:51:56,917 --> 01:52:01,462
No, this is not right.
Um, my son was never exposed to drugs...

1640
01:52:01,631 --> 01:52:03,841
...or pornographic material
or any of those things.

1641
01:52:04,007 --> 01:52:05,759
My husband just assumed...

1642
01:52:05,926 --> 01:52:09,262
I saw it with my own eye, Maggie.

1643
01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:11,890
Did you register a complaint?

1644
01:52:12,057 --> 01:52:15,185
Uh, my client
didn't officially register, Your Honor.

1645
01:52:15,353 --> 01:52:20,481
But I think the circumstances call
for immediate action, uh...

1646
01:52:20,649 --> 01:52:22,150
...for the safety of the child.

1647
01:52:22,318 --> 01:52:26,320
The problem is, judge,
is that my ex-wife, ahem...

1648
01:52:26,488 --> 01:52:31,659
...she's a sick person, and she needs help.
She deals in sex and drugs for a living.

1649
01:52:31,828 --> 01:52:33,787
No, I don't do drugs.

1650
01:52:33,954 --> 01:52:37,291
Your Honor, she has been
in and out of trouble with the law...

1651
01:52:37,458 --> 01:52:39,292
...on several occasions
for this sort of thing.

1652
01:52:39,461 --> 01:52:42,796
No, no. No, not anymore. No.

1653
01:52:42,963 --> 01:52:45,256
Have you ever been arrested?

1654
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:48,342
Yes.

1655
01:52:49,595 --> 01:52:54,182
When was the last time you were arrested,
and, uh, what was the charge?

1656
01:53:11,909 --> 01:53:15,662
Okay, okay, okay,
let's get ready for this experiment.

1657
01:53:16,206 --> 01:53:18,539
Hi. Jack Horner here.

1658
01:53:18,707 --> 01:53:22,877
Uh, we're in the back of this beautiful
limousine in the back seat...

1659
01:53:23,046 --> 01:53:26,631
...riding along west on Sherman Way.

1660
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:32,720
And beside me is a beautiful, talented,
gorgeous, young actress...

1661
01:53:32,889 --> 01:53:36,140
...from adult cinema, Miss Rollergirl.

1662
01:53:36,309 --> 01:53:38,601
Hi. Hello. Howdy.

1663
01:53:38,770 --> 01:53:41,604
Are you ready
to get on with this experiment?

1664
01:53:41,773 --> 01:53:44,440
- Ready. Ready like Freddy.
- Ha-ha-ha.

1665
01:53:44,609 --> 01:53:49,488
Yes. And we're, uh, going along,
like I said, west on Sherman Way...

1666
01:53:49,655 --> 01:53:53,242
...and this is called On the Lookout.

1667
01:53:53,408 --> 01:53:57,246
That's the name of this show.
On the lookout for a young stud...

1668
01:53:57,412 --> 01:54:00,666
...who maybe
will get in the back seat here...

1669
01:54:00,833 --> 01:54:04,168
...and get it on with Rollergirl.

1670
01:54:04,337 --> 01:54:09,257
Uh, and we're going to make
film history...

1671
01:54:09,425 --> 01:54:11,926
...right here on videotape.

1672
01:54:25,733 --> 01:54:28,652
- Hello?
- Hey.

1673
01:54:29,279 --> 01:54:31,320
Waiting for someone?

1674
01:54:32,614 --> 01:54:34,157
Yeah.

1675
01:54:34,324 --> 01:54:38,494
I'm waiting for somebody, but I'm not sure
if they're gonna show up, though.

1676
01:54:39,372 --> 01:54:41,414
You wanna wait in the car?

1677
01:54:43,417 --> 01:54:44,877
Cool.

1678
01:55:12,988 --> 01:55:14,739
I'm Joe.

1679
01:55:15,490 --> 01:55:17,326
Dirk.

1680
01:55:19,996 --> 01:55:21,997
You know who I am?

1681
01:55:24,042 --> 01:55:25,667
No.

1682
01:55:27,086 --> 01:55:29,337
My name's Dirk Diggler.

1683
01:55:30,923 --> 01:55:32,506
No.

1684
01:55:33,009 --> 01:55:36,136
I mean, you're a guy.
I'm just helping you out.

1685
01:55:36,720 --> 01:55:38,180
Yeah.

1686
01:55:39,349 --> 01:55:40,599
What do you see here?

1687
01:55:41,975 --> 01:55:43,851
Well, I see a girl. Ha, ha.

1688
01:55:44,020 --> 01:55:46,604
Ha, yeah. Well, you like what you see?

1689
01:55:46,773 --> 01:55:51,525
- Um, yeah. Yeah, I do.
- Ha, ha, all right. Get in.

1690
01:55:51,694 --> 01:55:56,030
Get in and let's make film history.

1691
01:55:58,743 --> 01:56:00,534
So...

1692
01:56:01,328 --> 01:56:03,121
...what do you wanna do?

1693
01:56:04,122 --> 01:56:06,291
It's what you wanna do.

1694
01:56:08,293 --> 01:56:10,212
I wanna watch you.

1695
01:56:11,381 --> 01:56:14,173
I mean, I'm not gay. I just wanna...

1696
01:56:15,342 --> 01:56:18,470
Maybe you could jerk off a little,
and I could watch.

1697
01:56:19,680 --> 01:56:23,225
Maybe I'll join in later,
but for now, I just wanna watch.

1698
01:56:25,395 --> 01:56:27,186
Twenty bucks.

1699
01:56:29,399 --> 01:56:31,440
Ten's all I have.

1700
01:56:35,697 --> 01:56:37,279
You go to school?

1701
01:56:37,448 --> 01:56:40,074
Um, yeah. Yeah, I do.

1702
01:56:40,243 --> 01:56:42,118
Where do you go to school?

1703
01:56:42,286 --> 01:56:43,953
Um...

1704
01:56:44,372 --> 01:56:46,331
Is it okay if I don't tell you?

1705
01:56:46,498 --> 01:56:48,667
Yeah. Yeah, that's cool.

1706
01:56:48,835 --> 01:56:50,252
Ahem.

1707
01:56:50,420 --> 01:56:52,587
You recognize Rollergirl from her films?

1708
01:56:52,755 --> 01:56:57,300
Yep. Ha, ha, yeah. Yeah,
we watch her films a lot at my frat house.

1709
01:56:57,467 --> 01:57:00,554
- I go to, uh... I go to CSUN.
- Wonderful.

1710
01:57:00,721 --> 01:57:03,431
Yeah, the fucking guys
will never believe this, ha, ha.

1711
01:57:04,559 --> 01:57:09,229
So, you know, we've done a whole
bunch of films together, Rollergirl and l.

1712
01:57:09,604 --> 01:57:11,105
Do you remember me?

1713
01:57:11,274 --> 01:57:12,774
Ahem.

1714
01:57:12,942 --> 01:57:15,193
We went to school together.

1715
01:57:16,904 --> 01:57:18,988
Your name's Brandy, right?

1716
01:57:20,115 --> 01:57:22,951
Brandy? Brandy's your name, right?

1717
01:57:24,578 --> 01:57:26,203
No.

1718
01:57:26,456 --> 01:57:29,498
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Your name's not Brandy?

1719
01:57:33,296 --> 01:57:36,047
Well, ha... Okay.

1720
01:57:39,551 --> 01:57:42,470
Maybe...? Maybe do it harder?

1721
01:57:51,730 --> 01:57:54,899
Faster. Do it a little faster.

1722
01:57:58,279 --> 01:58:00,238
All right.

1723
01:58:03,576 --> 01:58:07,828
You're hiding her again.
Let's get on the other side. That's it.

1724
01:58:09,498 --> 01:58:13,042
Just nice and sexy, you know...

1725
01:58:13,211 --> 01:58:14,877
Yeah.

1726
01:58:19,884 --> 01:58:23,845
Listen, pal, you gotta make it
a little more sexy, you know?

1727
01:58:24,012 --> 01:58:26,597
Don't just ram it in there like that.

1728
01:58:26,765 --> 01:58:29,810
This is not a hole in the wall, pal.
This is Rollergirl.

1729
01:58:30,269 --> 01:58:31,853
Faster.

1730
01:58:35,233 --> 01:58:37,109
Do it faster.

1731
01:58:38,027 --> 01:58:41,195
- Get your hand wet.
- Be quiet.

1732
01:58:43,365 --> 01:58:47,202
Can you be more sexy?
Like, uh, cinematically sexy.

1733
01:58:47,369 --> 01:58:49,246
Just don't ram it. Don't...

1734
01:58:50,747 --> 01:58:53,875
Be respectful. This is Rollergirl.

1735
01:58:54,752 --> 01:58:56,086
Are you listening to me, kid?

1736
01:58:56,253 --> 01:58:59,256
- Just let me do my thing. I know what...
- This is stupid, Jack.

1737
01:58:59,422 --> 01:59:03,592
Okay, that's it. Hold it. Cut. Pull over.

1738
01:59:04,052 --> 01:59:05,177
Pull over.

1739
01:59:13,436 --> 01:59:16,773
I can't fucking believe this.
Jesus Christ, you gave me a hard-on, lady.

1740
01:59:16,940 --> 01:59:19,568
The least you could do
is jack me off or something.

1741
01:59:20,194 --> 01:59:21,944
What the fuck did you say?

1742
01:59:23,363 --> 01:59:26,615
I just said it's not that cool
to leave me with a hard-on, all right?

1743
01:59:26,783 --> 01:59:28,784
Fuck you.

1744
01:59:30,912 --> 01:59:33,289
I don't fucking believe this.

1745
01:59:35,542 --> 01:59:37,627
This is a fine life
you've made for yourself.

1746
01:59:39,546 --> 01:59:41,715
You really should be proud.

1747
01:59:41,923 --> 01:59:43,800
I mean, really.

1748
01:59:45,595 --> 01:59:48,596
- Fucker.
- Yeah, fuck you.

1749
01:59:49,431 --> 01:59:51,682
And your fucking films suck now anyway.

1750
01:59:57,523 --> 01:59:59,274
Come on.

1751
02:00:01,359 --> 02:00:05,113
I can't. I can't get it hard, all right?
I just can't. I'm sorry.

1752
02:00:09,868 --> 02:00:13,412
You just shouldn't
do this sort of thing, faggot.

1753
02:00:13,581 --> 02:00:14,956
Get out of the car, man!

1754
02:00:15,123 --> 02:00:17,917
Jack, Jesus. No, Jack. Jack.

1755
02:00:18,085 --> 02:00:20,753
Jack. Jack. Hey.

1756
02:00:20,921 --> 02:00:22,213
Jack. Jack.

1757
02:00:22,381 --> 02:00:24,841
Get him out of the fucking truck, man!

1758
02:00:25,009 --> 02:00:26,635
You shouldn't be coming down here.

1759
02:00:26,801 --> 02:00:30,346
Jack. Jack. Jesus Christ.

1760
02:00:30,514 --> 02:00:33,891
- Come on, Jack. Jack.
- You little fucker.

1761
02:00:34,060 --> 02:00:36,685
- You piece of shit. You faggot.
- Fuck you.

1762
02:00:36,854 --> 02:00:38,479
Faggot, you like that?

1763
02:00:38,648 --> 02:00:41,149
- Jack. Jack.
- Amateur fucker.

1764
02:00:42,359 --> 02:00:43,944
Come on.

1765
02:00:51,993 --> 02:00:54,328
You don't ever disrespect me.

1766
02:00:54,497 --> 02:00:58,250
Fucker! You don't ever disrespect me,
you fucker!

1767
02:00:58,417 --> 02:01:02,002
- Motherfucker, look at you now, huh?
- That's what you get, faggot.

1768
02:01:02,171 --> 02:01:05,131
You think you can fuck?
You can't fuck me, you fucker!

1769
02:01:05,632 --> 02:01:09,344
You can't touch me!
You can't touch me, you fucker!

1770
02:01:09,511 --> 02:01:10,886
Stop it.

1771
02:01:12,890 --> 02:01:17,851
- You don't do this, donkey-dick. You don't.
- Unh!

1772
02:01:18,270 --> 02:01:20,063
Fucking faggot.

1773
02:01:24,527 --> 02:01:29,029
- You don't ever disrespect me, you fucker!
- Come on.

1774
02:01:29,198 --> 02:01:31,533
You fucking piece of shit!

1775
02:01:31,701 --> 02:01:37,204
You fucking... Fucking die, you shithead!

1776
02:02:14,201 --> 02:02:15,784
- Okay.
- Okay.

1777
02:02:15,953 --> 02:02:20,457
- What do you want?
- I want an apple fritter, jelly...

1778
02:02:20,623 --> 02:02:25,252
...um, chocolate with sprinkles,
and, um, a bear claw too.

1779
02:02:25,421 --> 02:02:28,590
- A bear claw. Okay.
- Yeah. And hurry.

1780
02:02:28,757 --> 02:02:31,676
Hey, how's my little kung-fu fighter?

1781
02:02:31,844 --> 02:02:33,970
He's kicking ass inside my stomach.

1782
02:02:34,137 --> 02:02:36,305
- Ha, ha. See? That's a boy.
- Uh-huh.

1783
02:02:36,474 --> 02:02:37,849
Okay.

1784
02:02:39,810 --> 02:02:42,561
- Okay, be right back.
- Okay.

1785
02:02:44,606 --> 02:02:47,359
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up? Can I help you?

1786
02:02:47,525 --> 02:02:50,194
- Yeah. Uh, I'm gonna get a dozen.
- All right.

1787
02:02:55,033 --> 02:02:58,286
Let me get, uh, a couple bear claws.

1788
02:02:59,204 --> 02:03:01,831
- Two bear claws.
- Yeah.

1789
02:03:03,125 --> 02:03:05,126
A couple glazed.

1790
02:03:07,296 --> 02:03:10,798
Oh, apple fritter. No, no. Not that one.
The one in front of it.

1791
02:03:10,966 --> 02:03:15,052
- Yeah, that one. That one. That one.
- Okay.

1792
02:03:17,765 --> 02:03:20,391
Oh, yeah. Two chocolate.

1793
02:03:21,226 --> 02:03:22,268
Two chocolates.

1794
02:03:22,435 --> 02:03:24,520
Old-fashioned, yeah.
Give me two of those.

1795
02:03:24,688 --> 02:03:26,814
Two old-fashioned.

1796
02:03:27,524 --> 02:03:31,277
Oh, is this, uh...?
Did you do this for the Christmas?

1797
02:03:31,444 --> 02:03:33,445
- Yeah.
- Oh, that's cute.

1798
02:03:33,613 --> 02:03:38,158
Yeah, give me two of those
sprinkly Christmas things.

1799
02:03:38,327 --> 02:03:39,828
- Yeah.
- Christmas hoops.

1800
02:03:39,994 --> 02:03:41,662
That's great.

1801
02:03:43,666 --> 02:03:47,252
- Okay, uh, how many is that?
- That's 11.

1802
02:03:51,548 --> 02:03:55,092
All right, motherfucker,
empty the cash register now. And hurry up.

1803
02:03:55,261 --> 02:03:58,304
- Jesus Christ.
- Shut the fuck up.

1804
02:03:58,471 --> 02:04:00,222
Hurry up with that shit.

1805
02:04:04,686 --> 02:04:07,855
No, no, no, motherfucker.
Empty the safe too, asshole.

1806
02:04:11,193 --> 02:04:12,694
And I ain't got all night.

1807
02:04:15,864 --> 02:04:18,824
- Don't even move.
- I'm not moving. I'm not moving.

1808
02:04:18,993 --> 02:04:20,868
Shut up!

1809
02:04:25,498 --> 02:04:27,750
- Don't fucking move, man.
- I'm not... I'm not...

1810
02:04:27,917 --> 02:04:29,877
Shut the fuck up.

1811
02:04:30,045 --> 02:04:31,880
Hey, don't... Don't do that. No, no, no.

1812
02:04:32,046 --> 02:04:35,425
No, no, no. You shut the fuck up.

1813
02:04:36,217 --> 02:04:37,551
Give me this sh...

1814
02:05:28,103 --> 02:05:29,854
All right, this could be the thing.

1815
02:05:30,021 --> 02:05:32,273
Something to help us
score a little extra cash.

1816
02:05:32,774 --> 02:05:36,444
The guy's name is Rahad Jackson.
He's got more money than God.

1817
02:05:36,612 --> 02:05:39,530
He's got twice as much coke, crank,
and smack. All right?

1818
02:05:39,698 --> 02:05:43,158
This guy's gonna buy just about anything
anybody wants to sell him.

1819
02:05:43,327 --> 02:05:47,079
Just likes people hanging around
at his house partying, the whole thing.

1820
02:05:47,247 --> 02:05:48,622
How do you know him?

1821
02:05:48,791 --> 02:05:51,458
He used to come to Party Boys a lot.
Mutrix introduced me.

1822
02:05:51,627 --> 02:05:54,087
How will we do it exactly?
How would it all go down?

1823
02:05:54,255 --> 02:05:57,172
It's gonna go down like this.
I'm gonna call him on the phone...

1824
02:05:57,341 --> 02:06:00,676
...and I'm gonna tell him
I got a half a key of quality stuff.

1825
02:06:00,844 --> 02:06:02,804
Do you have his phone number?

1826
02:06:02,971 --> 02:06:04,389
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1827
02:06:04,556 --> 02:06:07,766
So I'm gonna call him on the phone.
I'm gonna give him a price.

1828
02:06:07,935 --> 02:06:08,976
How much?

1829
02:06:09,144 --> 02:06:11,479
Well, it's half a key, man.
It's, like, 5000 bucks.

1830
02:06:11,646 --> 02:06:14,899
- You split that up three ways...
- It's enough to get the Vette fixed.

1831
02:06:15,067 --> 02:06:18,110
That's right, man.
So we're gonna do the deal.

1832
02:06:18,279 --> 02:06:20,822
We're gonna drop
half a key of baking soda into a bag.

1833
02:06:20,989 --> 02:06:22,990
We're gonna walk over there.
We're gonna...

1834
02:06:24,493 --> 02:06:26,786
Boom. Right there.

1835
02:06:26,953 --> 02:06:31,039
- This could be a nifty bit of hustle-bustle.
- Wait. Do you have his address?

1836
02:06:31,207 --> 02:06:33,376
Fucking, Reed, yeah.
I got his fucking address.

1837
02:06:33,543 --> 02:06:36,212
What? Yeah, okay, question. Sorry.

1838
02:06:36,380 --> 02:06:39,506
Hold on. What if he tests the stuff out?

1839
02:06:40,091 --> 02:06:42,342
- He won't.
- Well, how do you know that?

1840
02:06:42,845 --> 02:06:46,430
Because I know he won't. I'm positive.

1841
02:06:46,599 --> 02:06:48,850
You guys should be careful.

1842
02:06:49,018 --> 02:06:51,185
- Scotty.
- What?

1843
02:06:51,353 --> 02:06:52,520
What do you mean, "What?"

1844
02:06:52,688 --> 02:06:56,565
Do me a favor. Just mind your business,
please. What the fuck?

1845
02:06:56,734 --> 02:06:58,234
Sorry.

1846
02:06:58,402 --> 02:07:00,194
Anyway, heh...

1847
02:07:00,362 --> 02:07:02,863
Dump it in there good. Dump it in clean.

1848
02:07:04,408 --> 02:07:06,533
Hey, hey, hey,
you can't lay this all on me, man.

1849
02:07:06,702 --> 02:07:08,869
We're gonna go in there... This is it.

1850
02:07:09,037 --> 02:07:10,496
Fine.

1851
02:07:12,541 --> 02:07:14,333
You guys ready for this?

1852
02:07:14,501 --> 02:07:16,210
- I am.
- Dirk?

1853
02:07:16,377 --> 02:07:20,715
- Me? Yeah, yeah. I was born ready, man.
- All right.

1854
02:07:22,091 --> 02:07:23,717
- What the fuck is that?
- It's a big gun.

1855
02:07:23,886 --> 02:07:26,179
- No shit, but why?
- Just in case.

1856
02:07:26,346 --> 02:07:28,555
Shit.

1857
02:07:28,890 --> 02:07:29,931
Fucking great.

1858
02:07:30,100 --> 02:07:31,975
- You never said anything about a gun.
- Shh.

1859
02:07:32,144 --> 02:07:33,560
Now I'm nervous. Do you have a gun?

1860
02:07:33,729 --> 02:07:35,896
- No, I don't have a gun. He never said...
- Shh. Relax.

1861
02:07:36,064 --> 02:07:40,318
- Let's just get in and out, all right? Ln, out.
- Not too fast. It makes it look suspicious.

1862
02:07:41,737 --> 02:07:43,320
Goddamn it.

1863
02:07:43,488 --> 02:07:45,405
You all right?

1864
02:07:45,573 --> 02:07:48,784
- Just let me do all the talking, all right?
- Just be cool.

1865
02:07:59,546 --> 02:08:02,297
How you doing? Come on in.

1866
02:08:05,677 --> 02:08:07,636
Whoa.

1867
02:08:09,722 --> 02:08:11,932
- Hey, man.
- Hello, come on in.

1868
02:08:12,850 --> 02:08:14,268
Hey.

1869
02:08:25,447 --> 02:08:27,614
Hey, Rahad.

1870
02:08:27,783 --> 02:08:28,990
Hello, friends.

1871
02:08:29,618 --> 02:08:31,118
- Hey.
- Which one is Todd?

1872
02:08:31,286 --> 02:08:35,122
Yeah, that's me. Ha, ha.
We met before, down at Party Boys.

1873
02:08:35,289 --> 02:08:37,792
Yeah, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on in. Come on in.

1874
02:08:37,960 --> 02:08:39,961
Uh, these are my friends here.
Dirk and Reed.

1875
02:08:40,128 --> 02:08:42,796
Good to see you.
Take a seat. You want something to drink?

1876
02:08:44,173 --> 02:08:45,841
- Want a pill? Coke? Little dope?
- No.

1877
02:08:46,009 --> 02:08:48,927
- Uh, you sure you don't want something?
- No, thank you. No.

1878
02:08:49,512 --> 02:08:52,305
So got something? Huh?

1879
02:08:52,474 --> 02:08:54,015
We got something here?

1880
02:08:54,643 --> 02:08:56,853
Here it is.
That's about half a key right there.

1881
02:08:58,313 --> 02:09:00,355
- All right.
- That is some quality shit.

1882
02:09:01,734 --> 02:09:03,859
- If you wanna test that out...
- Don't worry about him.

1883
02:09:04,027 --> 02:09:06,319
- ...I mean, go ahead. If you want.
- No, no, no. Wait.

1884
02:09:07,948 --> 02:09:09,698
Here's that build-up. I love this part.

1885
02:09:19,710 --> 02:09:21,002
Fucking love that song.

1886
02:09:22,671 --> 02:09:24,671
So anyway, uh, what's the price?

1887
02:09:29,845 --> 02:09:39,436
Well, ha-ha-ha, we, ha-ha-ha...

1888
02:09:39,604 --> 02:09:43,399
Maybe, I don't know, 5 grand.

1889
02:09:45,610 --> 02:09:48,154
- Five grand.
- Yeah.

1890
02:09:50,532 --> 02:09:52,783
All right. No problem. That's cool.

1891
02:09:58,122 --> 02:09:59,582
Five grand?

1892
02:09:59,750 --> 02:10:01,583
Five grand.

1893
02:10:05,671 --> 02:10:07,340
Okay.

1894
02:10:21,729 --> 02:10:23,355
You guys wanna play baseball?

1895
02:10:23,940 --> 02:10:25,983
- No, thank you.
- No.

1896
02:10:27,735 --> 02:10:31,363
The black guy has a gun in his jacket.
Todd?

1897
02:10:40,082 --> 02:10:42,166
Let's get up and get the fuck out of here.

1898
02:10:42,333 --> 02:10:44,085
Todd, count the fucking money in the car.

1899
02:11:00,560 --> 02:11:04,646
Hey, you wanna see something
really fascinating?

1900
02:11:08,860 --> 02:11:11,279
- Check it out.
- Oh, wow. That's sweet.

1901
02:11:13,782 --> 02:11:15,658
- That thing's not loaded, is it?
- Not yet.

1902
02:11:15,826 --> 02:11:18,327
- Ls that silver?
- Look... See, we...

1903
02:11:18,494 --> 02:11:20,787
- Let's see what happens now, huh?
- Don't point...

1904
02:11:20,956 --> 02:11:24,250
- Could you not point the gun, please, sir?
- Ha-ha-ha.

1905
02:11:24,417 --> 02:11:25,458
- Todd.
- You wanna watch.

1906
02:11:26,962 --> 02:11:29,255
- Why? You think I can't do it?
- No, wait, wait.

1907
02:11:29,422 --> 02:11:31,966
- Huh? Ha-ha-ha. You think I can't do it?
- Sir?

1908
02:11:32,134 --> 02:11:34,969
- You wanna see me do it? You dare me?
- No, we don't dare you.

1909
02:11:36,305 --> 02:11:37,470
Fucking dare me.

1910
02:11:43,478 --> 02:11:45,645
Thank you, thank you.

1911
02:11:47,649 --> 02:11:49,859
Your fucking faces, man.

1912
02:11:53,363 --> 02:11:55,197
What the fuck?

1913
02:11:56,490 --> 02:11:59,868
Hey, I love this thing. I make these
little mix tapes together, you know?

1914
02:12:00,037 --> 02:12:04,289
I put all my favorite songs together. Which
one is this? Number, uh, 11. I love it.

1915
02:12:04,457 --> 02:12:07,501
You know, when you buy a tape
or something or an album...

1916
02:12:07,668 --> 02:12:11,171
...you put it on, and the songs,
the bands put them in some fucking order...

1917
02:12:11,340 --> 02:12:15,216
...like they want you to listen to it in
that order. I hate that. Fucking hate that.

1918
02:12:15,385 --> 02:12:19,012
I don't like to be told what to listen to,
when to listen to it, or anything.

1919
02:12:27,521 --> 02:12:28,648
Fuck.

1920
02:12:30,567 --> 02:12:33,694
It's Cosmo. He's Chinese.

1921
02:12:34,445 --> 02:12:37,364
That's why he likes
lighting off firecrackers. Huh?

1922
02:13:12,234 --> 02:13:14,568
Ricky Springfield. He's a buddy of mine.

1923
02:13:31,752 --> 02:13:35,046
Todd, we're leaving, man. Todd.

1924
02:13:35,215 --> 02:13:37,591
Let's go. All right?

1925
02:14:18,382 --> 02:14:19,632
We're leaving.

1926
02:14:19,801 --> 02:14:22,720
Sir. We gotta split, man. We gotta go.

1927
02:14:22,887 --> 02:14:25,639
Aw, come on. You just got here.
Let's hang out, let's party.

1928
02:14:25,806 --> 02:14:29,685
We got somewhere else to go.
We scheduled dinner with friends.

1929
02:14:29,853 --> 02:14:31,811
We're not leaving yet.

1930
02:14:34,483 --> 02:14:38,069
We're here now,
and we want something else from you.

1931
02:14:39,029 --> 02:14:40,779
Hey.

1932
02:14:40,947 --> 02:14:42,363
Hey, hey, hey.

1933
02:14:44,451 --> 02:14:46,786
We want something else from you.

1934
02:14:47,621 --> 02:14:48,662
What?

1935
02:14:48,829 --> 02:14:51,414
Todd, what the hell are you doing, man?
Let's just go.

1936
02:14:52,667 --> 02:14:54,835
In the master bedroom...

1937
02:14:55,837 --> 02:14:59,631
...under the bed in a floor safe.

1938
02:14:59,800 --> 02:15:01,216
Understand?

1939
02:15:01,842 --> 02:15:04,261
- What is the matter with you? Let's go.
- Todd.

1940
02:15:04,429 --> 02:15:05,845
- Come on, man.
- Shut up, Dirk.

1941
02:15:06,014 --> 02:15:08,349
I told you I got a plan.
I got a very good plan.

1942
02:15:09,309 --> 02:15:11,018
Are you kidding me, kitty?

1943
02:15:11,185 --> 02:15:12,811
No, I'm not, see?

1944
02:15:12,979 --> 02:15:15,939
I'm not kidding.
I want what's in the safe.

1945
02:15:16,108 --> 02:15:19,318
We want what is in the goddamn safe,
in the goddamn master bedroom...

1946
02:15:19,485 --> 02:15:22,863
...in the fucking floor, in a goddamn
fucking floor safe, that's all.

1947
02:15:23,030 --> 02:15:24,489
Todd, don't be crazy, okay?

1948
02:15:24,658 --> 02:15:28,077
Sir, we don't know anything about this.
This is not at all what we wanted.

1949
02:15:28,244 --> 02:15:31,454
Shut the fuck up, Dirk.
Do not reach for your gun, man.

1950
02:15:31,622 --> 02:15:33,373
Don't reach for your gun.

1951
02:15:47,721 --> 02:15:48,764
He went in the bedroom.

1952
02:15:49,390 --> 02:15:51,141
Todd, what the fuck are you doing?

1953
02:15:51,600 --> 02:15:54,728
- He went in the bedroom.
- Todd, when the fuck did you go crazy?

1954
02:15:54,895 --> 02:15:58,064
He's got coke, and he's got cash
in that safe in that bedroom...

1955
02:15:58,233 --> 02:16:01,068
...and if we leave here without it,
we're fucking idiots, man.

1956
02:16:01,235 --> 02:16:03,237
We came here
to motherfucking do something.

1957
02:16:03,404 --> 02:16:05,655
And we can fucking do it, all right?
You with me?

1958
02:16:05,823 --> 02:16:10,243
Todd, listen to me. Let's just split, man.
Let's just split now. This is not the thing.

1959
02:16:10,412 --> 02:16:12,246
This is not supposed to be the thing.

1960
02:16:12,413 --> 02:16:15,666
That's what I goddamn came here
to motherfucking do.

1961
02:16:15,833 --> 02:16:18,543
And that's what I'm gonna fucking do
right the fuck now.

1962
02:16:18,712 --> 02:16:21,005
Fuck no! Todd, don't!

1963
02:16:21,172 --> 02:16:23,090
- Don't be fucking stupid!
- Todd! Todd!

1964
02:16:26,427 --> 02:16:28,345
- Come on!
- Fuck! Go, man!

1965
02:16:28,512 --> 02:16:29,930
Come on, you puppies.

1966
02:16:34,435 --> 02:16:36,186
It's coming down for puppies!

1967
02:16:43,736 --> 02:16:47,323
Come on, come on, come on. Puppies!

1968
02:16:48,032 --> 02:16:49,992
No!

1969
02:16:51,411 --> 02:16:53,077
Oh, shit.

1970
02:16:53,788 --> 02:16:55,414
Come on!

1971
02:16:59,710 --> 02:17:00,793
Shit.

1972
02:17:16,269 --> 02:17:19,479
Fucking son of a bitch. Oh, God.

1973
02:17:19,647 --> 02:17:22,899
Oh, God. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

1974
02:17:23,067 --> 02:17:27,237
Fuck. Fucking stupid motherfucker.

1975
02:17:27,405 --> 02:17:29,531
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

1976
02:17:33,953 --> 02:17:35,663
Oh, fuck.

1977
02:17:36,497 --> 02:17:40,041
Oh, fuck. Son of a bitch.

1978
02:18:26,505 --> 02:18:28,215
Jack?

1979
02:18:35,181 --> 02:18:38,308
Jack, could you please help me?

1980
02:18:48,528 --> 02:18:50,029
I'm...

1981
02:18:55,326 --> 02:18:56,869
Uh...

1982
02:19:01,708 --> 02:19:04,792
I just... l wanted to come
and say sorry, you know.

1983
02:19:04,960 --> 02:19:06,586
And, um...

1984
02:19:09,256 --> 02:19:12,425
Well, I just wanna know
if you can help me, Jack.

1985
02:19:13,093 --> 02:19:15,637
I, um... l need help.

1986
02:19:18,265 --> 02:19:19,850
And, um...

1987
02:19:20,602 --> 02:19:22,602
...I'm sorry, you know?

1988
02:19:26,398 --> 02:19:28,441
I need help, Jack.

1989
02:19:40,496 --> 02:19:42,622
I'm so fucking sorry, Jack.

1990
02:19:46,543 --> 02:19:48,796
I'm sorry too, kid.

1991
02:19:51,299 --> 02:19:53,674
It's okay, baby.

1992
02:19:53,843 --> 02:19:56,719
- We all need to start again.
- Yeah.

1993
02:19:56,888 --> 02:19:58,806
Okay.

1994
02:19:58,972 --> 02:20:00,849
Shh.

1995
02:20:01,016 --> 02:20:02,683
It's okay.

1996
02:20:06,480 --> 02:20:08,606
It's okay, baby.

1997
02:20:08,774 --> 02:20:10,691
Shh.

1998
02:20:10,860 --> 02:20:14,570
Yeah. You're all right, baby.

1999
02:20:14,738 --> 02:20:17,365
- One more. Let's go. Please. Eleven.
- Eleven.

2000
02:20:17,533 --> 02:20:19,033
Yeah.

2001
02:20:22,996 --> 02:20:25,165
Did I hear someone say deal?

2002
02:20:25,333 --> 02:20:27,501
This weekend and this weekend only...

2003
02:20:27,668 --> 02:20:32,004
...Buck's Super Cool Stereo Store is making
super-cool deals on all name brands.

2004
02:20:32,173 --> 02:20:33,590
We're open. We're ready.

2005
02:20:33,757 --> 02:20:37,511
All you need to do is walk over,
get down, and come inside us.

2006
02:20:39,847 --> 02:20:41,432
Word.

2007
02:20:41,850 --> 02:20:44,601
Cut. Excellent.

2008
02:20:44,769 --> 02:20:47,228
Buck, honey, that was great.

2009
02:21:03,120 --> 02:21:04,663
I said, shut up, Colonel.

2010
02:21:06,833 --> 02:21:08,916
Shut up, Colonel.

2011
02:21:12,629 --> 02:21:14,715
I said, shut up.

2012
02:21:17,468 --> 02:21:24,057
Cinco, cuatro, tres, dos, uno.

2013
02:21:36,404 --> 02:21:39,656
Wait, wait, wait. What happened there?

2014
02:21:39,824 --> 02:21:46,579
That's a Q. That's supposed to be a G.
Oh, man. No, no.

2015
02:22:07,184 --> 02:22:08,769
Go.

2016
02:22:13,941 --> 02:22:15,650
What the heck?

2017
02:22:16,693 --> 02:22:19,279
Naughty, naughty, Candy.

2018
02:22:21,199 --> 02:22:22,657
- Push.
- Okay, ready to push?

2019
02:22:22,825 --> 02:22:24,450
Okay, let's push. Let's push. Let's push.

2020
02:22:25,827 --> 02:22:29,331
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.
Go, go, go. Push, push, push.

2021
02:22:29,498 --> 02:22:31,123
Yes. Yes.

2022
02:22:31,291 --> 02:22:33,709
- God almighty, fucking Christ.
- We're almost there.

2023
02:22:33,878 --> 02:22:36,629
- No, don't cuss, sweetie.
- One big push for me, all right?

2024
02:22:36,798 --> 02:22:40,217
Big push for the doctor. Big push.
This is it. Big push. Push, push, push.

2025
02:22:43,012 --> 02:22:45,138
- I got it, I got it, yeah.
- He got it.

2026
02:22:45,306 --> 02:22:46,764
It's a boy. It's a boy.

2027
02:22:54,816 --> 02:22:56,899
No hurry, guys.
Just sometime this year, huh?

2028
02:22:57,067 --> 02:23:01,572
- Jack, should we put it in the garage?
- Put it where I told you to put it.

2029
02:23:02,699 --> 02:23:03,949
Oh.

2030
02:23:04,117 --> 02:23:05,908
Maurice.

2031
02:23:06,661 --> 02:23:10,038
- You've got to turn a fan on.
- Lt smells good, doesn't it?

2032
02:23:10,206 --> 02:23:11,665
No. It smells like shit.

2033
02:23:11,833 --> 02:23:14,001
Oh, come on. This is Puerto Rican cooking.

2034
02:23:14,167 --> 02:23:16,503
Everybody's complaining
in the whole neighborhood.

2035
02:23:16,671 --> 02:23:18,672
This is what they're complaining about.
Taste this.

2036
02:23:18,840 --> 02:23:21,549
No, I can't taste it, not now.
I'll taste it later.

2037
02:23:24,094 --> 02:23:26,138
Rollergirl, yoo-hoo.

2038
02:23:26,306 --> 02:23:27,763
Honey, honey. Listen to me.

2039
02:23:27,932 --> 02:23:31,143
Take the dirt on one side of your room
and move it to the other side.

2040
02:23:31,310 --> 02:23:33,686
- Okay.
- Then one side of the room will look clean...

2041
02:23:33,854 --> 02:23:36,189
...that used to look dirty.
That'll be good, huh?

2042
02:23:37,691 --> 02:23:41,444
Oh! Johnny Weissmuller.
That's my swimmer.

2043
02:23:41,612 --> 02:23:44,614
- Say, "Hello, Uncle Jack."
- Five gold medals, look at that.

2044
02:23:44,781 --> 02:23:47,783
- Say, "Hello, Uncle Jack."
- Oh, look at him.

2045
02:23:47,951 --> 02:23:51,621
- You like Uncle Jack's pool?
- Who is the Olympic-fever baby?

2046
02:23:51,997 --> 02:23:54,248
- Who's the Olympic-fever baby?
- Say, "Hi, Jack."

2047
02:23:54,416 --> 02:23:55,791
- Say, "Hi. Hi."
- "Hi, Jack."

2048
02:23:55,959 --> 02:23:58,629
- "Watch me kick."
- He's not gonna piss in the pool, is he?

2049
02:23:58,796 --> 02:24:02,674
- I don't think so.
- Do you like Uncle Reed? Yes, you do.

2050
02:24:02,842 --> 02:24:04,509
- He is a good boy.
- Yo, Buck.

2051
02:24:04,676 --> 02:24:07,720
I gotta talk to you about
the stereo modification for this system.

2052
02:24:07,888 --> 02:24:09,388
- No technical shit.
- No, no, no.

2053
02:24:09,557 --> 02:24:12,433
If you don't get the right modification
it's not gonna be loud.

2054
02:24:12,602 --> 02:24:14,560
Loud isn't what I want.
I don't want loud.

2055
02:24:14,728 --> 02:24:16,063
- I want...
- Mellow.

2056
02:24:16,229 --> 02:24:18,522
Mellow. That's what I want.

2057
02:24:18,691 --> 02:24:20,734
- Okay.
- Buck, I want mellow.

2058
02:24:20,902 --> 02:24:23,569
Mellow. Mellow.

2059
02:24:23,737 --> 02:24:25,237
Yeah.

2060
02:24:25,406 --> 02:24:28,492
Oh, great, honey. Great.

2061
02:24:38,085 --> 02:24:40,086
Are we ready?

2062
02:24:40,254 --> 02:24:44,049
We have got all the time we want.

2063
02:24:44,800 --> 02:24:46,718
What are you looking at?

2064
02:24:47,302 --> 02:24:50,388
- I'm looking at you.
- You're staring.

2065
02:24:50,556 --> 02:24:52,599
You know what I'm staring at?

2066
02:24:53,601 --> 02:24:59,355
I'm staring at the foxiest bitch
in the whole world.

2067
02:25:28,093 --> 02:25:30,554
I've been around this block twice now.

2068
02:25:30,721 --> 02:25:32,638
I'm looking for something.

2069
02:25:32,807 --> 02:25:34,390
A clue.

2070
02:25:34,933 --> 02:25:38,060
I've been looking for clues,
and something led me back here.

2071
02:25:38,478 --> 02:25:41,355
Yep. So here I am.

2072
02:25:41,691 --> 02:25:45,317
Could have been me, the one that was
at Ringo's place when the shit went down.

2073
02:25:45,486 --> 02:25:49,406
Hey, I know how it is. I've been there.

2074
02:25:49,656 --> 02:25:51,992
We've all done bad things.

2075
02:25:52,159 --> 02:25:55,287
We've all had those guilty feelings
in our heart.

2076
02:25:55,663 --> 02:26:00,000
You wanna take your brain out of your head
and wash it and scrub it and make it clean.

2077
02:26:00,167 --> 02:26:01,959
Well, no.

2078
02:26:04,004 --> 02:26:06,338
But I'm gonna help you settle this.

2079
02:26:06,506 --> 02:26:09,550
First we're gonna check for holes,
see what we can find.

2080
02:26:09,718 --> 02:26:14,055
Then we're gonna get nice and wet
and you're gonna spread your legs.

2081
02:26:14,474 --> 02:26:18,101
Oh, that's good. So you know me.

2082
02:26:18,269 --> 02:26:20,436
You know my reputation.

2083
02:26:20,604 --> 02:26:24,191
Thirteen inches is a tough load.
I don't treat you gently.

2084
02:26:24,358 --> 02:26:28,528
That's right. I'm Brock Landers.

2085
02:26:29,155 --> 02:26:38,789
So I'm gonna be nice.

2086
02:26:38,956 --> 02:26:41,123
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

2087
02:26:41,291 --> 02:26:44,335
Where the fuck is Ringo?

2088
02:27:09,111 --> 02:27:11,195
I am a star.

2089
02:27:11,405 --> 02:27:14,240
I'm a star. I'm a star. I'm a star.

2090
02:27:14,407 --> 02:27:17,619
I am a big, bright, shining star.

2091
02:27:33,718 --> 02:27:35,427
That's right.

2092
02:34:28,634 --> 02:34:30,385
I just...

2093
02:34:37,476 --> 02:34:39,519
I just wanna talk to you.

2094
02:34:44,649 --> 02:34:46,525
I just want...

2095
02:34:48,028 --> 02:34:49,779
Raphael.

2096
02:35:01,666 --> 02:35:03,667
Oh, shit.

2097
02:35:11,468 --> 02:35:14,970
Shit. Raphael.

2098
02:35:15,556 --> 02:35:17,222
Where is he?

2099
02:35:17,725 --> 02:35:19,391
Where's Ringo?

2100
02:35:21,561 --> 02:35:23,021
I know where it goes.
