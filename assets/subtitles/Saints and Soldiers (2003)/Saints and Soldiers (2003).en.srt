Ahhh!

21
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,460
Ahhh!

22
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,510
Ahh--Ahhh!

23
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,420
Ahh!

24
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,550
Stop crying!

25
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,050
You're making Dieter here
a little nervous.

26
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,590
Ahh! Ahhh!

27
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,050
I need that.

28
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,760
Okay, okay...

29
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,260
Thanks.

30
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,960
Ah, Zigaretten.

31
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,130
I hope you choke on it.

32
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,520
Lemon powder.

33
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,840
Meine Frau.

34
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,010
Du sprichst Deutsch?

35
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,010
Ya.

36
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,390
Hmm.

37
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,430
Bitte--

38
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,300
Hier.

39
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,430
Danke.

40
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,060
You must be living right, Deac.

41
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,140
Halt! Halt!

42
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:02,970
Come on!

43
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,310
Come on, this way!

44
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,430
Deacon.

45
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,190
Out!

46
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,720
Heraus! Jetzt!

47
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:48,770
No, don't shoot!

48
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:51,440
Nein shooten!
Nein shooten!

49
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,520
Shoot him!

50
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,570
Shoot him!

51
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,100
Shoot him.

52
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,730
I surrender.

53
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:09,810
What are you waiting for?

54
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:12,900
Shut up!

55
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,900
Give me the gun!

56
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:14,900
No!

57
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,470
Hey, hey!

58
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,900
Why didn't you take that shot?

59
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,030
Do you know what you just did?

60
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,020
Shh!

61
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,980
Deac.

62
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,560
Come on.

63
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,270
Get down, get down low.

64
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,110
Oh!

65
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,940
What happened back there, Deac?

66
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,990
He had a Kraut in his sights
and he froze.

67
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,110
He's one of ours.

68
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,110
Yeah.

69
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,230
Get down!

70
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,110
Boy, am I glad to see you fellas.

71
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,570
Gould, I've been hit.

72
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,490
What in the Sam Hill
happened back there?

73
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:20,980
I'm Steven Gould.

74
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,900
This is Shirl Kendrick, 285th.

75
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,400
Gordon Gunderson,
Nathan Greer, 101st.

76
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,610
Kendrick, hold still.

77
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,610
It's just a graze,
I can fix you un right here.

78
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,780
We gotta get out of here

79
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,150
and find shelter
before it turns dark.

80
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,030
Due respect, Sarge,
but I didn't come to

81
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,610
the war to hide out.

82
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,740
Nobody asked you, Kendrick.

83
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,570
Look, we're behind
the enemy lines.

84
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,650
In a couple of days,

85
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:42,940
the bombers are gonna
drive these bastards

86
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,730
back to Berlin.

87
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,780
For now,
they're shooting prisoners,

88
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,990
and we got one Kraut rifle

89
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,820
with, what?

90
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,950
Sheesh.

91
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,150
Four rounds left in it.

92
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,780
Hell, I just wanna shoot me
some more Krauts.

93
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,650
We gotta get out of here.

94
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,030
Deacon, you gotta go point.

95
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,870
This way. Move it.

96
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:08,240
I don't see any weapons.

97
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,870
An ambulance.

98
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:15,080
They mowed down
a damn ambulance.

99
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,620
Deac...

100
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,080
Deac...

101
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,820
Why don't you, uh, head up
the hill and keep watch.

102
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,870
I'm gonna see if we can find
some stuff we can use,

103
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:31,990
and then we'll get out of here.

104
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,710
All right?

105
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,710
I hate robbing the dead.

106
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:48,030
They're already been robbed.

107
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:51,450
Just grab whatever we can use.

108
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:10,490
Deac.

109
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,460
Put this on.

110
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,170
Put it on.

111
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,030
I need you at the road
checking stuff out.

112
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,240
Go on, get.

113
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,370
Damn.

114
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,830
What?

115
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,830
I found some K-rations.

116
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,500
And?

117
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,370
Some dummy took
all the cigarettes out.

118
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,250
How long has Deacon been gone?

119
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:33,710
Almost an hour.

120
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,370
That's a nice watch, Gould.

121
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:38,460
He's not gonna miss it, trust me.

122
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,630
If I catch a bullet,

123
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,700
you gonna take my personals too?

124
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,040
You don't have anything I want,
Kendrick.

125
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,710
Except maybe your flashlight.

126
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,540
Funny.

127
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,550
Hey, Sarge,

128
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,950
what's the deal with Deacon?

129
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,870
He seems a little...jumpy.

130
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,880
Deacon's fine.

131
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,380
He's just a little on edge.

132
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:02,290
He seems like a nice enough
fella and all, just...

133
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,790
He's shell-shocked.

134
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:07,080
I've seen it a million times.

135
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,920
Don't worry about it.

136
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,130
Yeah, it's just a little
frightening.

137
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,970
We only have one weapon,
and he's holding it.

138
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,960
Yeah, we do have one weapon.

139
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,130
How did we get that weapon,
Gould?

140
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,090
Deacon saved my ass

141
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:22,090
more times that I care
to think about.

142
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,790
He's fine.

143
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:30,550
What'd ya find, Deac?

144
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,510
Home, sweet home.

145
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,130
Yeah, this will work

146
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,920
to hold up in for a couple of days.

147
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,290
Deac, I want you on first watch.

148
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,340
Let's see if we can get a fire going

149
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,340
in this thing.

150
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,800
Gould, you got any matches?

151
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,010
No.

152
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:55,460
I found the latrine.

153
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,880
Like I said--
home, sweet home.

154
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,340
Great, this thing's safe.

155
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,840
Hey, Gunderson.

156
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,840
What's the deal

157
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,840
with you and Deacon?

158
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,350
You guys separated at birth?

159
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,670
Cousins?

160
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:01,220
Deacon's the squarest guy
I know.

161
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,930
He's from some little
backwards town in Arizona.

162
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,800
Doesn't drink,

163
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,800
doesn't smoke.

164
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,340
He doesn't even like coffee.

165
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,720
That's why they call him
The Deacon.

166
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:16,300
My boys back
in the neighborhood--

167
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,920
if they knew my best buddy

168
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,300
was a good church boy like him,

169
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,630
they'd laugh their butts off.

170
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,180
I'll tel you something else
about Deacon--

171
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,300
he's the best shot
I've ever seen.

172
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,300
Where are you from, Sarge?

173
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,600
Chicago, south side.

174
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,050
Is that right?

175
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,050
How about you?

176
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:41,050
Louisiana.

177
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:43,840
Small town.

178
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,260
Really small.

179
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:48,920
How about you, Gould?

180
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,670
Where are you from?

181
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,050
New York.

182
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:57,010
What part of New York?

183
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,850
Brooklyn.

184
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:01,630
Heights.

185
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,010
I like Brooklyn.

186
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:06,310
Good jazz clubs.

187
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,840
Yeah, you want good jazz,
you gotta go to the Village.

188
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,970
You want great jazz,
you go to New Orleans.

189
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:17,390
That's a good place.

190
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,850
Father in Heaven,

191
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:48,390
forgive me for

192
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,060
the things I've done.

193
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,060
I just need--

194
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,350
Stop.

195
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:04,970
This is your card.

196
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,850
That's a pretty good trick,
Kendrick.

197
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:08,850
Got a jeep coming!

198
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,390
Keep going.

199
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,230
Keep going, keep going...

200
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:22,590
They're stopping.

201
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,680
Gunderson!

202
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:36,930
Hallo!

203
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:37,980
Jemand zu Hause?

204
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,390
Ach!

205
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:05,610
Ohh!

206
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,770
I-- I don't know.

207
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:12,900
Deac, what'd you get?

208
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,320
I couldn't hear 'eh very good.

209
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,320
Something about the
Meuse River

210
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,140
and the plane crashin'.

211
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,480
Shh.

212
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,730
Bloody, come on!

213
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,730
Stand back!

214
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:30,770
I think he's a Kraut.

215
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:31,900
Not a step closer!

216
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,900
Don't shoot him.

217
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,900
I've got a gun.

218
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,940
He's a Brit.

219
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,150
Kendrick, go help him down.

220
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,400
Stand back!

221
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:38,560
Go.

222
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,770
All right now,
just calm down.

223
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:40,770
No!

224
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,320
Here we go.
Come on.

225
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,280
Get back!

226
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,820
Whoa!

227
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,850
Hey, take it easy.

228
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:49,850
Drop it!

229
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:50,860
You drop it!

230
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:51,980
Keep it down!

231
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:52,980
We're Americans.

232
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:53,980
Prove it!

233
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,190
What?

234
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,030
Who was the third president
of the United States?

235
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,030
Just put the gun down.

236
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,520
Thomas Jefferson.

237
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,360
Who was the fourth?

238
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,110
Madison.
What's with this guy?

239
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,280
What's the capital of Vermont?

240
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,530
Hartford-- I--

241
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:06,700
Sarge!

242
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,950
Give me a break!
Nobody knows that.

243
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,990
You tell me!

244
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:13,820
Haven't the foggiest.

245
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,740
Sorry, boys.

246
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,070
Where's your command post?

247
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:26,450
Used to be that way.

248
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:27,740
Sorry for the trouble.

249
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,530
Thank you.

250
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:30,980
Montpelier.

251
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,200
About how far back?

252
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,660
About 10 to 15 miles.

253
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,360
Soldier, who are you?

254
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,980
Flight Sergeant,
Oberon Winley,

255
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:44,990
Royal Air Force.

256
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,610
Oberon...

257
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:49,570
Winley.

258
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,610
Look, I am in possession
of some crucial intelligence.

259
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,740
I need to get to
the nearest command center.

260
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,820
Buddy, you must have smashed

261
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,570
your head on a tree
coming down or something.

262
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,830
Or a bloody field phone at least.

263
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:04,690
There are no field phones,
and you will keep it down.

264
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,070
Can we shoot him now, Sarge?

265
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,490
Shut up!

266
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:10,990
Winley,
where do you think you're going?

267
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,980
I was intended to fly
back to Manhay.

268
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,240
Really?

269
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,400
Well, we've had a bit
of bad luck around here.

270
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,280
A Panzer division went
on a spoiling expedition,

271
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,700
and we are now
behind the enemy lines.

272
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,610
This isn't some little
spoiling expedition.

273
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:25,780
This is a major
German offensive.

274
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,660
After the Germans attacked,

275
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,160
we were ordered to fly

276
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,530
an emergency photo
re-con mission

277
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:35,610
to collect electronic
intelligence.

278
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:38,030
We were flying

279
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,950
under some--
some cloud cover and...

280
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:44,030
snapped some
rather revealing photos.

281
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,400
But by the time we realized
what we had,

282
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:49,120
a German fighter
had shot us down.

283
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,280
So you need to get
to intelligence?

284
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:51,740
Yes.

285
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,910
And it's damn critical

286
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:56,530
that I get there
as soon as possible.

287
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,990
They've punched through...

288
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:03,780
all along here...

289
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,900
right where we're thinnest.

290
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,490
Why would they do that?

291
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:08,530
If they punch through here,

292
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:09,870
they're exposing their flank.

293
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,700
That's right.

294
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,750
Unless, of course,

295
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,490
they hurry and make it
to the Meuse River

296
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:16,700
and cross over.

297
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,660
I don't get it.

298
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,240
Well, if they cross the Meuse,

299
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,240
then they can turn

300
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:23,910
and take Leige.

301
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,990
I went through there
on my way in.

302
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,490
It's got one of
the biggest ammo dumps

303
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:28,990
I've ever seen there.

304
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,450
It's one of the largest
in Europe.

305
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:34,000
And if the Krauts take Leige,
they take the ammo dump.

306
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,280
Or we have to destroy it.

307
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,070
Either way, it's a straight shot

308
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,200
for them to take back Antwerp.

309
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,370
What is this?
This ain't German.

310
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:44,910
Thank you.

311
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,410
I have got to get these

312
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,240
to there

313
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,870
before the Germans cross
the Meuse River.

314
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,290
It's over 20 miles.

315
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:58,620
As a crow flies, yes.

316
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,830
Thank you.

317
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:04,000
And we're supposed to outrun
an entire Panzer division,

318
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,120
on foot?

319
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:08,160
You know,
we could follow this rail line

320
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,080
along here

321
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,370
and then cut up through here

322
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:18,700
and shortcut them.

323
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,870
Could save a lot of troops.

324
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,250
Hey...

325
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:37,500
Where'd you learn
to speak German?

326
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,550
What?

327
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,700
Your German--
where'd you pick it up?

328
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,960
Oh, in Berlin.

329
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,210
What were you doing there?

330
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,670
Going to school or something?

331
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:50,950
No, I was a missionary.

332
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,460
That must have been neat.

333
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,670
Hanging out with a bunch
of Krauts talking about God.

334
00:24:56,710 --> 00:25:00,590
How is Adolf?

335
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,620
I loved it.

336
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:05,880
It was the best time of my life.

337
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:23,420
Hey, Deac.

338
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,420
Deac!

339
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:29,510
You wanna see
a good magic trick?

340
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:34,580
I need a smoke.

341
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,340
Hi.

342
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,260
So, Winley...

343
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:44,120
where'd you say
you were from, exactly?

344
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,790
What is it, Kendrick?

345
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:48,130
You want one of my fags,
is that what it is?

346
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,840
Well, uh...

347
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,880
That's...

348
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,880
Hmm.

349
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,420
Forget I asked.

350
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,510
No problem.

351
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:02,090
How long has it been

352
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:05,170
since you and Deacon have slept?

353
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:07,960
Me--two days.

354
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,920
Him--three or four.

355
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,180
The longer he goes

356
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:15,170
without sleep...

357
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:18,050
the more he's gonna lose it.

358
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:20,720
Thank you.

359
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,880
What is he doing?

360
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,880
He's making sure

361
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,550
all's clear.

362
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,590
Okay, let's go.

363
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:46,920
Move it.

364
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,340
All right, look,

365
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,540
we've gone about 12 miles.

366
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,550
We've gotta stop.

367
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,090
We gotta get some shut-eye.

368
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:59,510
All right?

369
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,010
We're gonna get moving
in a hour.

370
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:02,010
I'm gonna take first watch.

371
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:03,180
No, I got it, Sarge.

372
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,340
No, you don't.

373
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,130
You gotta get down there
and get some sleep.

374
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:09,340
All right?
Go. Move it.

375
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,630
Careful.

376
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,800
Hey, Kendrick,

377
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,470
that was, uh,
nice work really.

378
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,500
Thanks, Sarge.

379
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:24,970
Yes, thank you for protecting us
from the birdies.

380
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:26,350
Very decent of you.

381
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:32,090
"Very decent of you."

382
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,890
I fell asleep.

383
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,970
Well, you're not the only one.

384
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:07,270
What about you?

385
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:15,010
No.

386
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,940
You sure you don't want
some coffee?

387
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:32,720
You sure you don't want
some hot lemonade?

388
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:43,970
What the hell are we
doing here, Deac?

389
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:46,770
This is crazy.

390
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:51,150
Yeah, you got that right.

391
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:53,930
I should be home right now.

392
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:57,520
Should be home playing
with my nephews,

393
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:01,020
flirting with the girl
at my dad's store...

394
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,390
What's her name?

395
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:11,770
I forgot her name.

396
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:15,270
And you--
you should be doing...

397
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:17,060
whatever you do.

398
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,980
I should be helping my wife
get ready for the baby.

399
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,390
You didn't tell me
you were having a baby.

400
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,070
I got the letter on Thursday.

401
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:36,430
She says she knows
it's gonna be a girl.

402
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,810
Huh.

403
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:41,150
She must be due
pretty soon then, huh?

404
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:43,440
Yeah, January 18th.

405
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,270
That's my birthday.

406
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,230
I know.

407
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:50,650
Huh.

408
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:53,730
Hmm.

409
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,520
Thursday--that was
the day we hit Essendor.

410
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,680
You'll be all right, Deac.

411
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:10,980
We just gotta get
Winley to Manhay...

412
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,020
win the war, and go home.

413
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:06,570
Hey, Deac.

414
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:08,900
I got some
lemonade packets.

415
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:12,650
I'll trade you
for a couple of butts.

416
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:13,820
Kendrick, give it a rest.

417
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:17,030
Nobody has any smokes,
especially not him.

418
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:21,110
I just need a smoke.

419
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:24,190
I gotta figure out
where the hell we are.

420
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,240
So, Gould...

421
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,530
what's your secret?

422
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:39,650
My what?

423
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:41,520
You know, your big secret

424
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:43,900
you don't tell the other chaps
around the campfire.

425
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,320
I mean, we've all got them.

426
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,870
I'm sure Kendrick here
has 10 or 20.

427
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:50,900
Yeah, I don't have one of those.

428
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,150
Rubbish.

429
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:56,200
Look, even if I did...

430
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,820
why would I tell you?

431
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:00,110
You don't have to tell me,
of course.

432
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,150
It's-- It's just that

433
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:04,400
we're on this perilous
mission together.

434
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,740
And I've found that

435
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,450
when man can share
anything with each other,

436
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:09,160
anything,

437
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,520
well, it creates a certain...

438
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:12,900
Esprit de Corps, you follow?

439
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:15,400
Forget it.

440
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:22,320
Righty-o.
You can play as you want.

441
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:27,740
I never kissed my wife
'til the day we were married.

442
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,780
All right, Deacon.

443
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:33,070
You see,
I feel close already.

444
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,950
When I was 15,

445
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,030
I showed up at school

446
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:38,160
with a shiner and a bloody lip.

447
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,410
I told the guys I got it
plying stick ball,

448
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:42,610
but I actually got it

449
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:45,360
'cause I got beat up
by Alice Palisky.

450
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,990
Alice Palisky.
Good.

451
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:50,280
All right, all right, I got one.

452
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:53,280
One time when I was, uh,
in high school,

453
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,360
I was working
on my dad's truck.

454
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,410
And I had one
of them vacuum tubes--

455
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:58,570
you know what I'm talking about.

456
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,120
And, uh,
I figured out that if I held it

457
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,690
just so and sucked--

458
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:07,160
I could give myself hickeys.

459
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,410
So I had them
all over my neck.

460
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:10,990
And I told my buddies that,

461
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,610
uh, that I had a girl
from out of town.

462
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:15,910
But, truth be known,

463
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:20,410
I never kissed
a girl before, ever.

464
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:22,370
I'm sorry.

465
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:23,360
What's so funny?

466
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,070
Sorry, everyone.

467
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:29,280
It's just, well, hickeys, huh?

468
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:31,700
Guess we found
a new nickname for Kendrick.

469
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,740
Let's go.

470
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,570
We're making good time,

471
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:37,990
but we gotta keep moving.

472
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:40,490
So, Winsley,
what's your secret, huh?

473
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:43,080
Good grief,
you think I'd tell you chaps?

474
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,490
I've just barely met you.

475
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:05,070
Is all Brits
as charming as Winsley?

476
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,110
I don't know.

477
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,290
What the hell is he doing?

478
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:31,410
No...

479
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:32,710
Deac!

480
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:33,910
No!

481
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:34,920
Deac!

482
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,660
No! No! No!
Don't kill me!

483
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,660
No, no!

484
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,740
Cover his mouth.

485
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:42,830
Come on, right here.

486
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:46,130
Deac, Deacon, Deacon, shh.

487
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:47,120
It's okay.

488
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,780
Be quiet.

489
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:49,910
Can you do something for him?

490
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,120
He needs a warm place to sleep.

491
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,580
Yeah, we don't really
have that, do we, Gould?

492
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,790
What can you do for him here?

493
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:54,790
Deacon!

494
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:56,290
Deacon!

495
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:57,530
Deacon, listen to me!

496
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:59,330
Do not get us killed!

497
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:02,250
Look at me! Look at me!

498
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:04,170
Open your eyes.
Look at me.

499
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:07,170
Relax.

500
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:08,490
Breathe.

501
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:11,290
I'm going to take my hand
away from your mouth.

502
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:14,420
Don not scream, okay?

503
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:17,990
Okay. Shh.

504
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:21,660
Did you see 'em?

505
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:22,830
Tell me you saw 'em.

506
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:25,330
It's okay, Deacon.
It's okay, Deacon.

507
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:49,580
Talk to me.

508
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:52,830
All right.

509
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:54,290
Last Thursday,

510
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:56,090
we ran into some Krauts
in a little town

511
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,050
in the Elsenborn Ridge.

512
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,130
They were pulling out,

513
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:00,830
but this one little bastard

514
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:03,710
was holed-up inside a church.

515
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:06,170
I sent Deacon to take him out.

516
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:08,800
It was dark in there.

517
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,750
Somebody took a shot at him.

518
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:15,630
So he threw in a grenade,
sprayed the room.

519
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:18,090
Went up and took the guy out.

520
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,620
In the room...

521
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:29,300
was two women and six kids.

522
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:32,620
It was a mess.

523
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:36,170
When it was over,

524
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,090
Deac just...

525
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,420
flipped out.

526
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:42,250
Our C.O. gave me a jeep

527
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:44,710
to have him checked out
at St. Vith.

528
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:47,300
We got captured about an hour

529
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:51,470
before you guys run
into them at Malmedy.

530
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:59,840
You don't mention this to him.

531
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,120
Do you understand me, Gould?

532
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:08,510
All right, what do we do?

533
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:13,040
We keep him talking.

534
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,880
We don't let him
go off by himself.

535
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,170
And please, put that rifle
in somebody else's hands.

536
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:24,710
Yeah.

537
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:29,010
47, 48, 49, 50, 51...

538
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:31,220
C'mon. Damn.

539
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:43,010
What is that?
Some kind of code?

540
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:45,000
No, it's the way I write.

541
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:47,920
I hope somebody
can translate that.

542
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,550
Of course. I can.

543
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:54,250
Are you trying to tell me
you're the only person

544
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,290
that knows what that says?

545
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:59,420
That more or less sums it up.

546
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:03,300
So us not letting you die
would be pretty important?

547
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:06,000
Yes.

548
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:08,050
Great.

549
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:09,220
Kendrick.

550
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,630
You got watch.

551
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,680
Gonna give you a gun.

552
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,250
I'm gonna scout a bit.

553
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:19,220
I'll be right back.

554
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,300
That is sick.

555
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,420
Yes, I'm sure you prefer
to use your fingers.

556
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:56,180
That's much better, Hickey.

557
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,970
Very distinguished.

558
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:00,090
That's better
than carrying it around

559
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:01,430
in your pocket all day.

560
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:14,510
That good reading?

561
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:25,770
Do you believe in a life
after this one?

562
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:27,310
Not a chance in hell.

563
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:31,140
When we first got there,

564
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:35,470
I was working on this kid.

565
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:37,730
He was shot up pretty bad.

566
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:40,890
He kept saying, "Please, God."

567
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:44,680
"Please, God," over and over...

568
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,350
like it meant something.

569
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:50,720
He was so sincere about it,

570
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:55,060
I thought it might work.

571
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:58,560
Then two minutes later
he was dead.

572
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:02,720
There wasn't a thing
I could do about it.

573
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,060
When I looked into his eyes...

574
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:09,100
there wasn't nothing there.

575
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:11,760
Nothing.

576
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:15,060
That's when I realized that...

577
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,480
this is it.

578
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:23,430
It's funny.

579
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:27,810
What can possibly be funny
about that?

580
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:29,810
No, I don't mean funny funny.

581
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:38,940
It's just that, uh...

582
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:43,310
We were just outside
Sainte-Mere-Englise.

583
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:47,640
We were getting pounded
pretty hard.

584
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:49,560
And I was holding this--

585
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:54,350
this kid on my lap, and...

586
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:58,940
he was shot up pretty good.

587
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:03,060
And I remember him praying.

588
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:07,560
And I was praying too.

589
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,810
Then all of a sudden, he--

590
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:16,230
he was gone.

591
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:18,440
And that was--
that was it, really.

592
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,110
That was the first time that I--

593
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:27,520
that I really watched somebody die.

594
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,560
But right then,
I knew that he was--

595
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:35,930
he was in a better place than that.

596
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:39,730
How convenient for you.

597
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:41,730
Convenient?

598
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:44,270
Yeah, that's
what I was just thinking

599
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:46,230
about what you said.

600
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:49,270
Funny, huh?

601
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:07,690
Where you from?

602
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:08,690
Arizona.

603
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:10,020
I know, Arizona.

604
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:13,610
Where in Arizona?

605
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:15,180
Snowflake.

606
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:18,850
Snowflake--
I never heard of it.

607
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:23,730
What do you do
in Snowflake for fun?

608
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:26,690
Hunting.

609
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:29,810
What do you hunt?

610
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:32,480
Whatever's in season.

611
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:36,480
So you like to shoot things?

612
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,520
Forget I asked.

613
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:45,700
So why do you like
the Krauts so much?

614
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:48,480
'Cause I know 'em.

615
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:51,480
I know that most of 'em
are just like you and me.

616
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,570
They just wear
a different uniform.

617
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:55,900
So Adolf Hitler is
a pretty nice fella?

618
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:57,100
Once you get to know him--

619
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,980
it's just a different uniform?

620
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:00,440
That's not what I said.

621
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,280
And those guys at
Malmedy--they're just like us,

622
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,860
except they got
different helmets on?

623
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,820
If it makes it easier
for you to hate 'em,

624
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:06,980
then go right ahead.

625
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,810
You know what,
if it weren't for them,

626
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:10,860
I'd be finishing up med school
and putting a cast

627
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,730
on Billy's leg 'cause he broke
it on his bicycle.

628
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:13,740
But instead,

629
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:15,070
I'm taking lead

630
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,610
out of his 17-year-old
brother's gut,

631
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:18,100
'cause he wanted
to serve his country,

632
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:19,360
and he lied about his age.

633
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,320
And now he's spitting up blood,

634
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,110
lying in the dirt,

635
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:26,070
and asking God
to come and save him.

636
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:28,520
It's more than a different uniform.

637
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:08,370
Are they crossed by yet?

638
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:10,690
They must be stalled
somewhere in here.

639
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:13,190
Yeah, this weather can't be
helping them much.

640
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,700
How far is it to Manhay?

641
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:18,370
About 15 kilometers.

642
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:20,020
All right.

643
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:22,190
This weather keeps up,
we should be able to beat 'em.

644
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:25,450
Get there by dark.
All right.

645
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:26,950
Let's move out.
Come on.

646
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:03,700
Ahhhh!

647
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:05,660
Kendrick!

648
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:16,990
Kendrick!

649
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:17,990
Kendrick!

650
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:19,490
Okay, buddy? Okay?

651
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:27,950
Kendrick, can you hear me?

652
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:29,370
We can't do this here!

653
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:32,410
We gotta get out of this.

654
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:33,530
If we stop now,
there's no way

655
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:34,740
we're going
to make it in time.

656
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:36,660
If we can't move,
they can't move.

657
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,450
And we can't move!

658
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:40,620
Get him out of here.

659
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:41,750
Come on.

660
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:43,490
We're going, we're going.

661
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:44,530
Careful, careful.

662
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:13,410
Stand right there.

663
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:17,830
Do not move.

664
00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:19,240
No, no.

665
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:20,290
You can't sit down.

666
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:21,910
You've gotta keep moving.
Get up.

667
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,080
Get up.
Keep moving.

668
00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:32,370
I'm gonna check it out.
Winley.

669
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:33,580
Give me your gun.

670
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:34,580
Just stand there,

671
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:35,870
keep your eyes open.

672
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:42,830
I'll go with ya.

673
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:44,080
I got it, Deac.

674
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,380
But, Sarge, I can--

675
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:49,870
Corporal!

676
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:51,410
Don't worry about it.

677
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:53,290
Just open the door.

678
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,200
It's okay, okay.
It's okay.

679
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:02,420
I'm not gonna hurt you, okay.

680
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:03,420
I'm American.

681
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:07,960
Put the knife down!

682
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,330
Put it down!
I don't want--

683
00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:11,330
Put it down!

684
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:16,090
It's okay.

685
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:18,210
It's okay, look,
I'm putting the gun down.

686
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:19,370
Okay?

687
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:22,000
Put the knife down.

688
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:25,960
I'm an American, okay?

689
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,170
It's okay,

690
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:28,760
it's okay.

691
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,920
Okay, put it down.

692
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:34,880
American.

693
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:38,710
American.

694
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:41,040
Yeah.

695
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:46,590
It's okay, fellas.

696
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:49,470
It's okay, uh...

697
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:51,540
This is, uh,
this is Madam Thearey.

698
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:52,540
Catherine.

699
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:54,380
Catherine, Catherine.

700
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:56,340
Uh, and this is Sophie.

701
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,090
Bon jour.

702
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:00,960
Bon jour.

703
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:04,920
Ah, yeah, yeah, we're all--
we're all Americans.

704
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,550
Uh, except for him.

705
00:50:06,590 --> 00:50:08,300
He's, uh, he's British.
He's from, you know, England.

706
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:51,840
Bien.

707
00:50:58,590 --> 00:50:59,880
Merci.

708
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:01,380
Merci.

709
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:03,590
Merci, Catherine.

710
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:06,000
What did she just say?

711
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:10,470
Goodbye...

712
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:13,470
in French.

713
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:06,380
Gunderson.

714
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:08,340
It's 15:00 hours.

715
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:33,930
We did everything we could,
Winley.

716
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:38,630
We certainly did.

717
00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:42,720
Still...

718
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:48,300
here I sit
all nice and comfy, while...

719
00:52:55,390 --> 00:52:58,930
You boys have been super.

720
00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:03,720
But I'm figuring
I best get on with it.

721
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,890
Look, if I start now,

722
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:07,810
I can probably get there
before morning.

723
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:09,970
Yeah.

724
00:53:10,010 --> 00:53:11,220
You could try.

725
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:14,140
I just don't know
what your frozen dead body

726
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:16,680
is gonna do for anybody.

727
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,680
You can give these

728
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:26,230
to Kendrick if you want.

729
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:30,010
Cheerio.

730
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:31,550
Winley.

731
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:39,440
You let him go.

732
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:43,930
He's not our prisoner, Gould.

733
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:46,730
He's gonna die out there.

734
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:48,730
Yes, he is.

735
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:10,730
Catherine.

736
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:12,100
Bon jour.

737
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:14,770
Bread.

738
00:54:14,810 --> 00:54:16,810
Thank you.

739
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:18,770
Winley?

740
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:20,900
Oh, Winley?

741
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:21,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

742
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:28,900
Deac?

743
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:30,610
We got company.

744
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,900
Oh, Sophie!

745
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:39,560
Catherine...

746
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:06,640
No!

747
00:55:06,690 --> 00:55:09,020
No!

748
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:10,900
No, no!

749
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:14,230
No!

750
00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:15,310
Hands off!

751
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:16,810
Hands off!

752
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:30,150
You gotta take him, Deac.

753
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:31,690
Deac!

754
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:36,480
Deac, get the Luger!

755
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:39,360
We gotta catch him!

756
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:58,480
Damn!

757
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:03,860
You gotta be kidding me.

758
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:17,230
Did you get him?

759
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:18,400
We lost him.

760
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:19,650
What happened to "dead eye"?

761
00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:21,610
I don't know.
I just couldn't hit him.

762
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:22,650
Couldn't or wouldn't?

763
00:56:22,690 --> 00:56:23,820
Hey, I did not miss
on purpose!

764
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:24,820
That's a lie!

765
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:27,400
That's enough!

766
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:29,480
If Deacon says he just missed him,
he just missed him.

767
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,480
We've got other things

768
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,980
to worry about right now.

769
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:36,490
Look what I found!

770
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:38,270
I heard gunshots,

771
00:56:38,310 --> 00:56:39,400
so I started
back through the woods,

772
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,400
and I found
this little bugger...

773
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,650
kneeling down, praying
his little Gerry head off.

774
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:45,950
I say we shoot him right now!

775
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:47,030
Shut up, Kendrick!

776
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,110
I'm with Kendrick.
Let's shoot him.

777
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:49,360
With his own gun!

778
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,400
We don't shoot prisoners, people.

779
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,400
Yeah, but he does.

780
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,400
Shoot him!

781
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,820
Shut up, Kendrick!

782
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:54,860
What's wrong with you?
Shoot him!

783
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:57,200
Winley, put the gun down!

784
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,610
You will obey my orders!

785
00:56:59,610 --> 00:57:01,780
Rudy?

786
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:12,990
What's going on?

787
00:57:15,570 --> 00:57:16,820
Deacon!

788
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:21,730
This is Rudolph Gertz
from Berlin.

789
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:27,450
When I was on my mission,
I taught his family, and I c--

790
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:34,650
I never miss.

791
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:36,870
Gundy, I didn't hit him...

792
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:39,690
but I never miss.

793
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:03,610
Sergeant.

794
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:04,910
Hmm.

795
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:08,120
Did you give my cigarettes to, uh...

796
00:58:13,610 --> 00:58:15,490
Thanks.

797
00:58:15,530 --> 00:58:17,780
No problem.

798
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:27,910
So, Winley,
why did you come back?

799
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:33,820
I heard gunshots,

800
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:36,660
and I realized I was probably
going to die out there.

801
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:39,410
I'm not proud of it.

802
00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:41,450
You made a choice.

803
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:45,320
You're still alive.
That's good for you.

804
00:58:45,370 --> 00:58:48,330
Yes, that's true.

805
00:58:48,330 --> 00:58:51,160
It's midnight.

806
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:55,450
Gould, you're up.

807
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:59,080
I see our prisoners-of-war's
having fun.

808
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:06,070
What'd he say name was?

809
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,740
Adolf.

810
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:13,030
He gives me the creeps.

811
00:59:13,070 --> 00:59:14,780
It's Rudolph.

812
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:20,500
Whatever.

813
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:24,490
Hey, Winley,
I'll make you a deal.

814
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:28,540
You pick a card, any card,

815
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:31,330
the put it back in the deck.

816
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:35,910
If I can find your card
in this deck,

817
00:59:35,950 --> 00:59:38,410
you give me one of them smokes.

818
00:59:38,410 --> 00:59:41,160
What do you say?

819
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:47,700
Deal.

820
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:54,000
Okay.

821
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:01,870
Got it?

822
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:08,580
Okay, now,
you just tell me when to stop.

823
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:14,750
Stop.

824
01:00:14,790 --> 01:00:17,080
This is your card.

825
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,160
Nope.

826
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,670
Sorry, Hickey.

827
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:26,490
This is your card.

828
01:00:45,630 --> 01:00:47,740
The French lady is coming.

829
01:00:47,790 --> 01:00:49,580
Bon jour, Catherine.

830
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:52,170
Bon jour.

831
01:00:52,210 --> 01:00:53,290
Thank you.

832
01:00:53,330 --> 01:00:56,500
Thank you all.

833
01:00:56,550 --> 01:01:00,370
Allez.

834
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:01,370
Joyeux Noel.

835
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:03,500
Merci.

836
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:04,630
Merci.

837
01:01:20,330 --> 01:01:23,080
Fröhliche Weihnacht.

838
01:01:23,130 --> 01:01:25,500
Fröhliche...

839
01:02:29,050 --> 01:02:30,760
Deacon!

840
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:31,790
Where is he?

841
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:38,130
Where's the Kraut, Deacon?

842
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:41,140
You let him go.
You let him go!

843
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:43,090
No, no, Deacon!

844
01:02:43,130 --> 01:02:44,130
Off, off!

845
01:02:44,210 --> 01:02:45,500
Let's go, right now!

846
01:02:45,550 --> 01:02:49,130
Hey, who had watch, Gould?

847
01:02:49,170 --> 01:02:50,260
Who had watch?!

848
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:52,330
I did.

849
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:53,920
But I fell asleep.

850
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:56,920
Then Deacon
didn't let anybody go.

851
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:58,920
Yes, I did.

852
01:02:58,970 --> 01:03:02,420
What?

853
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:05,420
Come on,
what'd you wanna do, Gundy?

854
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:06,550
Take him with us?

855
01:03:06,590 --> 01:03:10,130
No, I wanted to shoot him,
remember?!

856
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:12,580
What where you thinking?

857
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:16,210
I made a trade.

858
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:18,220
Rudy told me that the weather's

859
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:20,130
pretty much shut down
all movement on either side.

860
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:21,390
And that Manhay is in the middle

861
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:22,760
of some of the heaviest
fighting right now,

862
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,000
so we wouldn't be able to get

863
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,210
Winley through anyway.

864
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:26,550
But he also said
that an unknown number

865
01:03:26,590 --> 01:03:28,050
of Germans are making a push toward

866
01:03:28,090 --> 01:03:29,720
this little town, Longin.

867
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:32,050
That's less
than six kilometers away.

868
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:34,170
Right.

869
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:37,090
Those are our nearest boys.

870
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:39,090
I think we can make it
through to them.

871
01:03:39,130 --> 01:03:41,220
Yeah, sure.

872
01:03:41,260 --> 01:03:43,180
Through a fully armed Kraut division.

873
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:45,760
We sneak through.

874
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:53,220
I like it.

875
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:55,300
I don't love it, but I like it.

876
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:58,430
And with our full arsenal of
two pistols and a bolt-action.

877
01:03:58,470 --> 01:04:01,050
Kendrick...

878
01:04:01,090 --> 01:04:03,220
you check the back of that rig?

879
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:06,260
It's not much,
but we gotta make it count.

880
01:04:09,090 --> 01:04:10,550
It's outta gas.
The tank's empty.

881
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:12,550
All right.

882
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:16,050
Run it as far as you can
on fumes and then ditch it.

883
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:18,760
Take some grenades.

884
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:32,930
What kind of name is Oberon?

885
01:04:32,970 --> 01:04:35,020
It's from Shakespeare.

886
01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:36,260
You ever heard of him?

887
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:39,890
Yeah.

888
01:04:39,970 --> 01:04:41,300
What kind of a name is Shirl?

889
01:04:41,350 --> 01:04:45,100
It's short for Shirley.

890
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:47,090
Shirley.

891
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:49,890
Yes, Shirley.

892
01:04:49,930 --> 01:04:51,930
Don't get me wrong--

893
01:04:51,970 --> 01:04:53,470
I love the name Shirley.

894
01:04:53,510 --> 01:04:55,770
In fact, it's my mother's name.

895
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:01,220
You trying to get us killed?

896
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:03,260
Is that what you think?

897
01:05:03,310 --> 01:05:05,350
Marching through enemy lines--

898
01:05:05,390 --> 01:05:06,640
there's no danger there.

899
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:10,340
Yeah, well, it seems like
the right thing to do.

900
01:05:10,390 --> 01:05:11,930
We die trying.

901
01:05:11,970 --> 01:05:13,180
Yeah, maybe.

902
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:14,430
Of course, if someone killed

903
01:05:14,470 --> 01:05:15,850
a bunch of innocent
women and children

904
01:05:15,890 --> 01:05:18,430
this might be a real great way
to make up for it, right?

905
01:05:18,470 --> 01:05:21,140
Is that what your
little Bible tells you?

906
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:22,260
Huh?

907
01:05:22,310 --> 01:05:24,470
Is this your penance?

908
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:27,690
You know what?

909
01:05:30,470 --> 01:05:31,430
Here.

910
01:05:31,470 --> 01:05:32,640
What?

911
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:35,480
Take it.
I can get another one.

912
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:37,520
I don't want your book.

913
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:40,510
Really?

914
01:05:40,550 --> 01:05:43,010
'Cause with all your questions,
you seem awful curious.

915
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:44,930
Get back in formation.

916
01:06:00,050 --> 01:06:02,640
Let's take 'em.

917
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:04,850
Or not.

918
01:06:04,890 --> 01:06:06,270
We lay low,

919
01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:07,350
keep moving.

920
01:06:07,390 --> 01:06:10,600
That's good thinking, Kendrick.

921
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:12,350
What are we,
about a mile from Longin?

922
01:06:12,390 --> 01:06:15,270
Sounds about right.

923
01:06:15,310 --> 01:06:18,690
All right, sun's starting
to peek through.

924
01:06:18,730 --> 01:06:20,140
Let's go, boys.

925
01:06:30,190 --> 01:06:31,680
How you doing?

926
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,520
All right.

927
01:06:37,690 --> 01:06:41,100
You know, this really is
beautiful country.

928
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:44,310
Yeah, I knew you liked her.

929
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:48,940
I think I want to learn French.

930
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:55,600
Gunderson!

931
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:58,100
No!

932
01:07:07,350 --> 01:07:09,150
Stay with me, Gundy.

933
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:10,730
Gundy!

934
01:07:10,770 --> 01:07:13,890
Gundy, I'm comin'.

935
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:18,690
Breathe, breathe!

936
01:07:18,730 --> 01:07:19,690
No...

937
01:07:19,730 --> 01:07:20,690
Help him!

938
01:07:20,730 --> 01:07:21,690
He's dead.

939
01:07:21,730 --> 01:07:22,680
No, he's not.

940
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:27,480
Deac--

941
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:28,940
He can't...

942
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:32,150
Look...he's gone.

943
01:07:32,190 --> 01:07:33,890
Come on, we've gotta go.

944
01:07:33,930 --> 01:07:36,810
We've gotta go--now.

945
01:07:36,850 --> 01:07:38,060
All right, come on.

946
01:07:38,110 --> 01:07:39,520
Come on.

947
01:07:39,570 --> 01:07:40,520
Come on.

948
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:54,180
C'mon, Winsley, let's go.

949
01:07:54,230 --> 01:07:57,150
I can't.

950
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:13,860
Kendrick, go see if we're
still being followed.

951
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:14,850
Go to hell, Gould.

952
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:15,850
Now!

953
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:17,100
You go!

954
01:08:17,150 --> 01:08:18,900
Or you too worried
about saving your own skin?

955
01:08:18,940 --> 01:08:19,940
I'll go.

956
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:21,650
No, you're not going anywhere.

957
01:08:21,690 --> 01:08:22,860
Deacon!

958
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:24,400
Deac!

959
01:08:48,310 --> 01:08:49,520
They're still all over the place.

960
01:08:49,570 --> 01:08:50,780
What do we do now?

961
01:08:50,820 --> 01:08:52,030
We're gonna get shot out here.

962
01:08:52,070 --> 01:08:54,240
We need to find a place
I can work on him.

963
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:55,360
Can he move?

964
01:08:55,410 --> 01:08:57,400
Yes.
Yes, I can move.

965
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:58,980
All right, follow me.

966
01:09:06,450 --> 01:09:07,480
Deacon.

967
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,480
Huh?

968
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:11,440
I need your help.

969
01:09:11,490 --> 01:09:12,650
Put your fingers in here--

970
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:13,950
when I open the wound,

971
01:09:13,990 --> 01:09:15,160
push the muscle aside.

972
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:16,820
Don't scream.

973
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:18,230
Okay.

974
01:09:18,270 --> 01:09:20,150
It's all right.

975
01:09:20,190 --> 01:09:21,400
Doing all right, doing good.

976
01:09:23,530 --> 01:09:24,490
Open it a little further.

977
01:09:24,530 --> 01:09:25,490
I'm trying.

978
01:09:25,530 --> 01:09:27,120
I got it.

979
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:28,980
Come on. Almost done.

980
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:32,740
I got it.

981
01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:34,530
Ugh. That's it.

982
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:36,120
All right, I got it.
You're gonna be fine.

983
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:37,450
Hold still, hold still.

984
01:09:37,490 --> 01:09:38,770
Hang in there, Winley.

985
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:39,820
You're not gonna bleed to death.

986
01:09:39,860 --> 01:09:40,940
We'll take you to an aid station.

987
01:09:40,990 --> 01:09:44,030
Shhh!

988
01:09:44,070 --> 01:09:45,490
Krauts.

989
01:10:08,910 --> 01:10:11,150
Let's go!

990
01:10:11,190 --> 01:10:12,150
Here.

991
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,280
Heads up!

992
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:14,820
Come on! Move!

993
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:16,950
Come on!

994
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,150
Triples on the right flank!

995
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:36,200
I've got it!

996
01:10:57,620 --> 01:11:01,080
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

997
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:02,490
Kesndrick, get Winley outta here!

998
01:11:02,530 --> 01:11:05,410
Yeah, go!

999
01:11:05,450 --> 01:11:07,240
All right, ready?

1000
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:09,040
Move, move!

1001
01:11:18,950 --> 01:11:23,200
Grenade! Move, move, move!

1002
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:35,200
C'mon!

1003
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:36,580
Come on.

1004
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:39,120
I got him.

1005
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:52,920
Stay with me, stay with me.

1006
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:55,070
We're gonna make it.

1007
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,450
We're gonna make it.

1008
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:04,280
Shhh...

1009
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:08,910
Get out. Go.

1010
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:09,960
Fire in the hole.

1011
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:35,910
Come on, Hickey. Hang on.

1012
01:12:35,950 --> 01:12:37,660
Gould will be here in a second.

1013
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:38,700
Just hang on.

1014
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:40,000
Help...

1015
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:49,710
Just hang on, hang on!

1016
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:21,870
I'm sorry.

1017
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:31,370
Go!

1018
01:13:50,370 --> 01:13:51,710
Where are they?

1019
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:53,210
Right there.

1020
01:13:58,460 --> 01:13:59,920
Winley!

1021
01:14:09,330 --> 01:14:11,670
Winley!

1022
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:19,050
Where is he?

1023
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:22,290
There.

1024
01:14:22,330 --> 01:14:24,380
Winley! Winley!

1025
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:25,420
Winley!

1026
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:27,720
Winley! Come on.

1027
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:33,130
Winley. Winley, hang on.

1028
01:14:33,170 --> 01:14:35,090
Winley, come on.

1029
01:14:35,130 --> 01:14:38,510
Say something!

1030
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:43,790
Right here.

1031
01:14:48,340 --> 01:14:51,420
I can't swim.

1032
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:53,000
Is that your big secret?

1033
01:14:55,710 --> 01:14:56,840
Where's Kendrick?

1034
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:58,550
Kendrick's dead.

1035
01:15:51,550 --> 01:15:55,010
We gotta get these clothes off of him.

1036
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:01,640
So what now?

1037
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:03,350
I don't know.

1038
01:16:03,390 --> 01:16:05,710
How's your German?

1039
01:16:23,970 --> 01:16:25,590
All right.

1040
01:16:25,630 --> 01:16:28,050
The German line's about
a half mile up that way.

1041
01:16:28,090 --> 01:16:31,600
This road will take us
straight through the clearing.

1042
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:33,770
Our boys are dug in on the other side.

1043
01:16:33,810 --> 01:16:34,920
We ready?

1044
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:37,590
We get Winley through...

1045
01:16:37,630 --> 01:16:39,890
save some lives.

1046
01:16:39,890 --> 01:16:43,970
That's the idea.

1047
01:16:44,020 --> 01:16:44,980
I hid.

1048
01:16:45,020 --> 01:16:48,970
I didn't sign up.

1049
01:16:49,010 --> 01:16:53,680
I tried to dodge the draft.

1050
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:56,130
But my father came and found me.

1051
01:16:59,390 --> 01:17:01,430
Is that your big secret?

1052
01:17:01,470 --> 01:17:03,270
Huh.

1053
01:17:03,310 --> 01:17:04,470
Did you get that, Winley?

1054
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:28,510
Gould, cover up those weapons.

1055
01:17:30,180 --> 01:17:33,220
All right, Winley.
Look sick.

1056
01:18:24,140 --> 01:18:25,100
Hang on.

1057
01:18:28,810 --> 01:18:29,970
Go! Go! Go!

1058
01:18:36,310 --> 01:18:38,150
What's going on?

1059
01:18:38,190 --> 01:18:40,350
I can't tell.

1060
01:18:40,390 --> 01:18:42,720
I think they're trying to make a push.

1061
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:50,350
There's a jeep coming
from right over there.

1062
01:18:50,390 --> 01:18:51,600
Better get the Sarge on the radio.

1063
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:53,230
Let me see.

1064
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:56,060
Foxtrot 2-9er calling Foxtrot 0-2.

1065
01:18:59,730 --> 01:19:01,850
We got a jeep coming
from out of nowhere. Over.

1066
01:19:01,890 --> 01:19:03,560
Out.

1067
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,980
That's one of our jeeps.

1068
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:08,610
But that's a Gerry flag on the hood.

1069
01:19:08,650 --> 01:19:09,730
What are they trying to do?

1070
01:19:09,770 --> 01:19:11,720
I don't know what you
got in mind, Gerry.

1071
01:19:11,770 --> 01:19:14,560
But it ain't gonna happen.

1072
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:15,770
The flag! Now!

1073
01:19:15,810 --> 01:19:18,190
Get it!

1074
01:19:19,860 --> 01:19:22,180
Hang on a second!

1075
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:26,230
American!

1076
01:19:26,270 --> 01:19:27,400
What is it?

1077
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:30,150
We got two Krauts coming in,
right there.

1078
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:47,810
You okay?

1079
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:04,480
They're shooting at each other.

1080
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:07,520
You know what,
I think the boys are ours.

1081
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:08,730
Let's give them some cover fire.

1082
01:20:08,770 --> 01:20:10,070
Cover fire!

1083
01:20:10,110 --> 01:20:11,570
Into the trees, on me.

1084
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:19,360
I'm out! I'm out!

1085
01:20:21,860 --> 01:20:24,690
You take Winley and go,
and I'll cover you.

1086
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:27,690
No, I'm not going to leave you!

1087
01:20:27,730 --> 01:20:28,730
You go now!

1088
01:20:28,730 --> 01:20:29,730
No!

1089
01:20:34,070 --> 01:20:36,230
I'll be right behind you.

1090
01:24:41,620 --> 01:24:46,950
You saved my life.

1091
01:24:46,990 --> 01:24:50,500
Be at peace, Deacon.
