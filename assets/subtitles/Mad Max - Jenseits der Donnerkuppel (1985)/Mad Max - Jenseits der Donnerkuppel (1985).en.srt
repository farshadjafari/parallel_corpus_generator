1
00:02:44,605 --> 00:02:47,506
- Bull's-eye!
- You bet, Dad!

2
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,392
You go straight home.

3
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:19,069
Bombs away!

4
00:03:29,517 --> 00:03:31,883
Sayonara, sucker!

5
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:40,708
No preservatives, just pure water!

6
00:05:41,048 --> 00:05:43,380
Cool, clear water.

7
00:05:43,651 --> 00:05:46,142
Step up, schmuck, get some dealing done.

8
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,378
H20, that's my go.

9
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:52,716
Don't you understand? This is water.
You can't live without it.

10
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,230
What's a little fallout, huh?

11
00:06:18,853 --> 00:06:20,480
You get a sack of grain

12
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,087
...or a woman for 2 hours.

13
00:06:30,865 --> 00:06:33,026
- What are you trading?
- I'm looking for someone.

14
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,598
Are you trading or not?

15
00:06:34,869 --> 00:06:36,268
He had a team of camels.

16
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:41,439
People come here to trade, make a little
profit, do a little business.

17
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:45,109
If you've nothing to trade,
you've no business here.

18
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,371
An hour inside.

19
00:06:46,714 --> 00:06:47,738
Next!

20
00:06:48,049 --> 00:06:49,710
I got skills I can trade.

21
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,442
Sorry. The brothel's full.

22
00:07:10,905 --> 00:07:12,236
One hour.

23
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:15,465
- And if you find him?
- I'll ask him to return what's mine.

24
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,472
And he'll be desperate
to clear his conscience.

25
00:07:18,746 --> 00:07:19,735
He will be.

26
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:21,975
You that good?

27
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:27,318
Perhaps
you have something to trade after all.

28
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:28,815
Keep talking.

29
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,651
24 hours of your life.

30
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:34,821
In return,
you'll get back what was stolen.

31
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:36,986
Sounds like a bargain.

32
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:41,427
It's not. Let's talk. Come inside.

33
00:07:55,716 --> 00:07:58,184
Leave your weapons here. It's the law.

34
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:35,939
Remember, this is the vehicle
that sent Detroit broke.

35
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:39,449
Where did you get these animals?

36
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,621
The glorious dromedary.
The ship of the desert.

37
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:47,792
They got independent suspension power
steering and no emission control.

38
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,562
Ride them away now.

39
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,041
A warrior, Aunty.

40
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,871
Lost everything. Looking for a deal.

41
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,381
But he's just a raggedy man.

42
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:23,720
He's quick.

43
00:11:24,492 --> 00:11:25,516
Ironbar...

44
00:11:25,826 --> 00:11:27,316
...can he do it?

45
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:29,620
Maybe.

46
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,398
What did you do before this?

47
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:40,900
I was a cop, a driver.

48
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,845
But how the world turns.

49
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,742
One day cock of the walk,
next, a feather duster.

50
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,916
Play something tragic, Ton Ton.

51
00:11:57,191 --> 00:11:58,852
Do you know who I was?

52
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:00,753
Nobody.

53
00:12:01,428 --> 00:12:04,761
Except on the day after,
I was still alive.

54
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,257
This nobody had a chance
to be somebody.

55
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:14,097
So much for history. Anyway...
Water? Fruit?

56
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:07,155
Congratulations. You're the first
to survive the audition.

57
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:15,828
Drink.

58
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,433
It's okay.

59
00:13:30,284 --> 00:13:31,444
Come with me.

60
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:38,018
Look around. All this I built.

61
00:13:39,627 --> 00:13:42,187
Up to my armpits in blood and shit.

62
00:13:43,397 --> 00:13:45,763
Where there was desert,
now there's a town.

63
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:48,524
Where there was robbery, there's trade.

64
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,203
Where there was despair,
now there's hope.

65
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,196
It's civilization.

66
00:13:54,908 --> 00:13:57,206
I'll do anything to protect it.

67
00:13:59,947 --> 00:14:03,383
Today it's necessary to kill a man.
What do you say?

68
00:14:05,586 --> 00:14:06,746
What do you pay?

69
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:12,215
I'll re-equip you... vehicles, animals.
Fuel, if you want.

70
00:14:12,493 --> 00:14:13,983
It's a generous offer.

71
00:14:14,161 --> 00:14:17,392
Why me? You've got warriors, weapons.
Give the order.

72
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:20,492
We are dealing with subtleties here.

73
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,233
This is no enemy. It's almost family.

74
00:14:23,871 --> 00:14:25,736
I see, real civilized.

75
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:30,071
The reasons don't concern you,
just the conditions. Deal?

76
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:35,571
First, no one knows you're working
for Aunty.

77
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,077
You hit him, you go.

78
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,751
Second, it's a fair fight.

79
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,420
And third, it's to the death.

80
00:14:46,593 --> 00:14:47,924
Who's the bunny?

81
00:15:23,931 --> 00:15:27,526
We call it Underworld.
It's where Bartertown gets its energy.

82
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,625
0il, natural gas?

83
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,301
Pigs.

84
00:15:31,905 --> 00:15:33,566
Pigs like those?

85
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,140
- Bullshit.
- Pigshit.

86
00:15:37,644 --> 00:15:41,478
Pigshit.
The lights, the motors, the vehicles...

87
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:45,307
...all run by a high-powered gas
called methane.

88
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,644
Methane comes from pigshit.

89
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,819
Have a look. Tell me what you see.

90
00:15:55,028 --> 00:15:58,156
I see a big guy
giving a little guy a piggy back.

91
00:15:58,866 --> 00:16:01,334
MasterBlaster. They're a unit.

92
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,594
They even share the same name.

93
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:07,671
The little one is called Master.
He's the brains.

94
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,999
He runs Underworld.

95
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:14,174
The other one is Blaster.
He's the muscle.

96
00:16:14,715 --> 00:16:17,183
Together they can be very powerful.

97
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,181
They are also arrogant.

98
00:16:23,123 --> 00:16:26,524
We want to keep the brain,
dump the body.

99
00:16:26,794 --> 00:16:28,625
He's big. Is he good?

100
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:32,525
He can beat most men with his breath.

101
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,462
I want a closer look at him.
How do I get in there?

102
00:16:35,702 --> 00:16:38,796
- It's a factory. Ask for work.
- I know nothing about methane.

103
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,974
You can shovel shit, can't you?

104
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,257
Hey, you!

105
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,256
Let's talk!

106
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:41,261
Here, free man, come help a convict.
You don't want to end up like me.

107
00:17:41,702 --> 00:17:43,260
How long are you in for?

108
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,435
The big one. Life.

109
00:17:46,974 --> 00:17:47,998
For killing a pig?

110
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,433
I had to feed the kids.

111
00:17:50,777 --> 00:17:54,770
Doesn't worry me. Down here
life's two, three years.

112
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:11,628
Where is that bum mechanic Blackfinger?

113
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,474
We got a real problem.

114
00:18:24,745 --> 00:18:27,236
Twelve pounds of dynamite set to blow.

115
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,973
You expert! Disarm!

116
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:49,159
It's a class Job. One mistake,
it'll blow the crap out of this place.

117
00:18:49,436 --> 00:18:50,334
Literally.

118
00:18:50,604 --> 00:18:52,003
Think what to do!

119
00:18:54,641 --> 00:18:58,338
Now... the dynamite is connected
to the timing device...

120
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,671
...which is connected to the switch,
which I can't find...

121
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,950
...which is connected to the...

122
00:19:05,385 --> 00:19:06,352
...battery.

123
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,185
I'll disconnect the battery!

124
00:19:08,455 --> 00:19:09,945
I wouldn't do that.

125
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,690
Who you?

126
00:19:14,261 --> 00:19:15,023
Me Max.

127
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,059
You smart.

128
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,861
That's my vehicle.

129
00:19:18,131 --> 00:19:19,189
Disarm!

130
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,724
How much?

131
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:23,366
No trade. Do!

132
00:19:25,505 --> 00:19:26,164
Fetch!

133
00:19:31,979 --> 00:19:35,312
Me order. Me Master!

134
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:38,111
Me run Bartertown!

135
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,550
That's why you live in shit.

136
00:19:40,887 --> 00:19:42,878
Not shit! Energy!

137
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,219
Call it what you like,
it still smells like shit.

138
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,724
Not shit! Energy!
No energy, no town!

139
00:19:51,164 --> 00:19:53,325
Me King Arab!

140
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,398
Sure. Me, fairy princess.

141
00:19:55,802 --> 00:19:57,565
Embargo, on!

142
00:20:17,824 --> 00:20:20,725
Embargo on! Main valve off!

143
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:39,007
4, 3, 2...

144
00:20:39,846 --> 00:20:41,507
For God's sake, what now?

145
00:20:42,349 --> 00:20:44,681
Who run Bartertown?

146
00:20:45,185 --> 00:20:47,847
Damn it!
I told you, no more embargos.

147
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:51,457
More, Blaster.

148
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,531
Who run Bartertown?

149
00:21:04,204 --> 00:21:07,196
Who run Bartertown?

150
00:21:07,874 --> 00:21:09,535
You know who.

151
00:21:10,043 --> 00:21:11,203
Say.

152
00:21:12,379 --> 00:21:13,869
MasterBlaster.

153
00:21:14,548 --> 00:21:16,880
Say loud.

154
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:20,881
MasterBlaster.

155
00:21:21,888 --> 00:21:24,379
MasterBlaster what?

156
00:21:26,893 --> 00:21:29,726
MasterBlaster runs Bartertown.

157
00:21:30,063 --> 00:21:31,553
Louder!

158
00:21:32,732 --> 00:21:35,565
MasterBlaster runs Bartertown.

159
00:21:36,069 --> 00:21:38,230
Lift embargo.

160
00:22:05,499 --> 00:22:07,592
You want foot in face?

161
00:22:09,102 --> 00:22:10,592
Disarm.

162
00:22:11,771 --> 00:22:13,432
Good boy.

163
00:22:49,442 --> 00:22:50,306
Over here, Blaster.

164
00:23:19,673 --> 00:23:22,164
- What are you laying for?
- Nothing.

165
00:23:22,509 --> 00:23:23,942
- Who are you?
- Nobody.

166
00:23:24,177 --> 00:23:27,840
No, mister, I can feel it.
The dice are rolling!

167
00:23:34,321 --> 00:23:37,688
I want my camels, my vehicle,
food, water, methane.

168
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:40,657
Deal.

169
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,158
You said a fair fight.
What does that mean?

170
00:23:43,363 --> 00:23:45,524
As provided by law.

171
00:23:46,032 --> 00:23:47,192
Thunderdome.

172
00:23:51,538 --> 00:23:56,032
Two men, hand to hand.
No jury, no appeal, no parole.

173
00:23:56,376 --> 00:23:58,367
Two men enter, one man leaves.

174
00:24:00,347 --> 00:24:01,678
Weapons?

175
00:24:01,881 --> 00:24:05,044
Anything's possible. Chance decides.

176
00:24:05,719 --> 00:24:08,381
Thunderdome. How do I get in there?

177
00:24:08,755 --> 00:24:11,053
That's easy. Pick a fight.

178
00:24:48,461 --> 00:24:50,588
Everybody have a good time!

179
00:24:53,233 --> 00:24:56,760
That's my vehicle and I want it back!

180
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,761
Hearing wonky.
Sounds like an order.

181
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:01,765
That's right.

182
00:25:02,275 --> 00:25:06,439
Yumping Yesus! Him sad.
Brain broken.

183
00:25:08,281 --> 00:25:09,942
Me explain.

184
00:25:10,784 --> 00:25:13,617
This my vehicle. You...

185
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,781
...pedestrian!

186
00:25:20,293 --> 00:25:21,453
Three seconds...

187
00:25:21,795 --> 00:25:23,626
...break neck. One...

188
00:25:34,107 --> 00:25:35,472
MasterBlaster!

189
00:25:35,975 --> 00:25:38,136
Listen to the law!

190
00:25:38,478 --> 00:25:41,811
Aunty, two men in dispute.

191
00:25:45,218 --> 00:25:47,482
These our witness, Aunty.

192
00:25:47,821 --> 00:25:51,313
Us suffer bad. Us want justice.

193
00:25:51,825 --> 00:25:54,658
We want Thunderdome!

194
00:25:55,161 --> 00:25:59,154
You know the law.
Two men enter one man leaves.

195
00:26:01,835 --> 00:26:06,829
This Blaster.
Twenty men enter, only him leave.

196
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:10,332
Then it's your choice. Thunderdome.

197
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:46,702
Aunty! Aunty!

198
00:26:50,216 --> 00:26:54,209
Welcome to another edition
of Thunderdome!

199
00:27:18,745 --> 00:27:21,077
Listen on! Listen on!

200
00:27:21,815 --> 00:27:23,578
This is the truth of it.

201
00:27:23,917 --> 00:27:28,081
Fighting leads to killing,
and killing gets to warring.

202
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:31,581
And that was damn near
the death of us all.

203
00:27:32,425 --> 00:27:36,919
Look at us now, busted up
and everyone talking about hard rain.

204
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:42,094
But we've learned by the dust
of them all. Bartertown's learned.

205
00:27:42,602 --> 00:27:45,935
Now when men get to fighting,
it happens here.

206
00:27:46,272 --> 00:27:48,263
And it finishes here.

207
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:52,601
Two men enter, one man leaves.

208
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:20,963
And right now, I've got two men.

209
00:28:21,474 --> 00:28:24,466
Two men with a gut full of fear.

210
00:28:25,478 --> 00:28:29,812
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls...

211
00:28:32,318 --> 00:28:34,650
...dying time's here!

212
00:28:36,322 --> 00:28:39,655
He's the ball cracker. Death on foot.

213
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,152
You know him. You love him!
He's Blaster!

214
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:58,839
The challenger,
direct from out of the Wasteland.

215
00:28:59,178 --> 00:29:02,170
He's bad. He's beautiful.
He' s crazy!

216
00:29:03,182 --> 00:29:06,015
It's the man with no name!

217
00:30:00,873 --> 00:30:05,071
Thunderdome's simple. Get to the
weapons, use them anyway you can.

218
00:30:05,411 --> 00:30:08,903
I know you won't break the rules.
There aren't any.

219
00:30:14,487 --> 00:30:15,681
Remember where you are.

220
00:30:16,889 --> 00:30:18,254
This is Thunderdome.

221
00:30:18,758 --> 00:30:23,422
Death is listening and will take
the first man that screams.

222
00:30:25,565 --> 00:30:26,827
Prepare!

223
00:30:45,818 --> 00:30:48,378
Two men enter, one man leave!

224
00:35:52,091 --> 00:35:54,059
- You know the law!
- This is Thunderdome!

225
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,227
Kill him!

226
00:35:55,428 --> 00:35:58,420
No, no! Look at his face!

227
00:35:59,632 --> 00:36:01,099
He's got the mind of a child.

228
00:36:05,271 --> 00:36:07,102
It's not his fault.

229
00:36:10,443 --> 00:36:12,434
Blaster, I'm sorry.

230
00:36:13,112 --> 00:36:14,943
This wasn't part of the deal.

231
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:16,446
Deal?!

232
00:36:19,118 --> 00:36:20,915
What do you mean, "deal"?

233
00:36:22,421 --> 00:36:25,948
You must have tasted it.
It was in your hands.

234
00:36:26,625 --> 00:36:27,785
You had it all!

235
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:30,619
What do you mean, "deal"?

236
00:36:35,134 --> 00:36:36,624
No more methane!

237
00:36:37,136 --> 00:36:39,798
This place... finished!

238
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:41,403
No, little man.

239
00:36:41,707 --> 00:36:43,299
We've only just begun.

240
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:11,327
Open it.

241
00:37:16,175 --> 00:37:18,336
Two men enter. One man leave!

242
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,911
What's this?!

243
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:02,710
Do you think I don't know the law?
Wasn't it me who wrote it?

244
00:38:03,055 --> 00:38:05,717
And this man has broken the law.

245
00:38:06,058 --> 00:38:08,049
Right or wrong, we had a deal.

246
00:38:08,727 --> 00:38:12,060
And the law says,
"Bust a deal, face the wheel."

247
00:38:12,398 --> 00:38:14,730
Bust a deal and face the wheel.

248
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:33,250
All our lives hang by a thread.

249
00:38:33,752 --> 00:38:36,243
Now we've got a man
waiting for sentence.

250
00:38:36,589 --> 00:38:39,922
But ain't it the truth?
You take your chances with the law.

251
00:38:40,426 --> 00:38:42,917
Justice is only a roll of the dice...

252
00:38:43,262 --> 00:38:47,255
...a flip of the coin,
a turn of the wheel.

253
00:41:09,475 --> 00:41:10,806
Fix lt.

254
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:13,642
You run Bartertown.

255
00:41:14,146 --> 00:41:15,807
You fix.

256
00:41:24,823 --> 00:41:27,155
Not pigs! No!

257
00:41:47,846 --> 00:41:49,336
That's enough!

258
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:55,013
Do you want to use him or kill him?
Bring him up.

259
00:42:09,034 --> 00:42:12,367
Master, do what Ironbar says.

260
00:42:13,706 --> 00:42:16,539
I will. Yeah, I will.

261
00:47:51,877 --> 00:47:53,538
Savannah!

262
00:47:59,885 --> 00:48:01,716
Finn, look.

263
00:48:03,722 --> 00:48:06,384
It's him. I finded him.

264
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:09,721
It's Captain Walker.

265
00:48:53,772 --> 00:48:56,104
- What's his talk?
- He ain't made wordstuff.

266
00:48:56,441 --> 00:48:58,932
It's a long track.
Maybe he's burned out.

267
00:48:59,277 --> 00:49:01,768
Maybe.
Maybe he's just listening.

268
00:49:04,116 --> 00:49:05,913
Walker? Hello?

269
00:49:07,786 --> 00:49:09,947
Maybe he's talking,
but we ain't hearing.

270
00:49:10,288 --> 00:49:11,949
You see his lips ain't moving.

271
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:14,121
Not with wordstuff, with sonic.

272
00:49:14,459 --> 00:49:17,451
That ain't never gonna work,
sonic-bonny bullshit!

273
00:49:20,465 --> 00:49:22,456
This is Delta-Fox-X-Ray.

274
00:49:22,801 --> 00:49:24,132
Can you hear me?

275
00:49:25,137 --> 00:49:26,627
Delta-Fox-X-Ray.

276
00:49:28,573 --> 00:49:29,904
Come In.

277
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:33,471
Is anybody out there?

278
00:49:37,315 --> 00:49:38,646
Can you read me, Walker?

279
00:50:00,172 --> 00:50:01,662
What's up, Doc?

280
00:50:03,675 --> 00:50:05,836
Hey, take me with you!

281
00:50:08,346 --> 00:50:10,007
Can you hear me, Walker?

282
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:10,571
Fly, Walker!

283
00:51:50,949 --> 00:51:52,439
Who are you?

284
00:51:54,286 --> 00:51:55,776
Quiet!

285
00:51:58,123 --> 00:51:59,613
Shut up!

286
00:52:03,962 --> 00:52:05,953
Enough!

287
00:52:44,669 --> 00:52:46,159
Who are you?

288
00:52:48,273 --> 00:52:49,672
The waiting ones.

289
00:52:50,008 --> 00:52:51,168
Waiting for what?

290
00:52:51,443 --> 00:52:52,774
Waiting for you.

291
00:52:54,279 --> 00:52:55,303
And who am I?

292
00:52:59,851 --> 00:53:02,012
I think he be testing us.

293
00:53:03,855 --> 00:53:06,847
This a testing, Walker?
You reckon we been slack?

294
00:53:07,692 --> 00:53:09,683
I don't know. Maybe you've been slack.

295
00:53:10,362 --> 00:53:14,355
We ain't. We kept it straight.
It's all there.

296
00:53:14,699 --> 00:53:19,033
Everything marked, everything
'membered. You wait, you'll see.

297
00:53:27,212 --> 00:53:30,204
This you knows. I be First Tracker.

298
00:53:30,548 --> 00:53:32,982
Times past count I done the Tell.

299
00:53:33,718 --> 00:53:38,212
But it weren't me that tumbled Walker.
It was Savannah.

300
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:41,723
So it only right she take the Tell.

301
00:53:44,396 --> 00:53:48,730
This ain't one body's story.
It's the story of us all.

302
00:53:49,334 --> 00:53:52,735
We got it mouth to mouth.
You got to listen it and 'member.

303
00:53:53,071 --> 00:53:57,064
'Cause what you hears today
you got to tell the birthed tomorrow.

304
00:53:58,076 --> 00:54:00,408
I'm looking behind us now...

305
00:54:00,745 --> 00:54:02,736
...across the count of time...

306
00:54:03,081 --> 00:54:06,915
...down the long haul,
into history back.

307
00:54:07,252 --> 00:54:10,244
I sees the end what were the start.

308
00:54:10,588 --> 00:54:13,580
It's Pox-Eclipse, full of pain!

309
00:54:22,434 --> 00:54:27,098
And out of it were birthed
crackling dust and fearsome time.

310
00:54:27,439 --> 00:54:28,929
It were full-on winter...

311
00:54:29,274 --> 00:54:31,242
...and Mr. Dead chasing them all.

312
00:54:31,776 --> 00:54:35,610
But one he couldn't catch.
That were Captain Walker.

313
00:54:35,947 --> 00:54:40,611
He gathers up a gang, takes to the air,
and flies to the sky!

314
00:54:42,287 --> 00:54:46,951
So they left their homes,
said bidey-bye to the high-scrapers...

315
00:54:47,459 --> 00:54:50,951
...and what were left of the knowing,
they left behind.

316
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:54,291
Some say the wind just stoppered.

317
00:54:54,632 --> 00:54:57,965
Others reckon it were a gang
called Turbulence.

318
00:55:04,709 --> 00:55:06,199
And after the wreck...

319
00:55:06,544 --> 00:55:08,876
...some had been jumped by Mr. Dead...

320
00:55:09,214 --> 00:55:13,207
...but some had got the luck,
and it leads them here.

321
00:55:13,785 --> 00:55:18,722
One look and they's got the hots for it.
They word it "Planet Earth."

322
00:55:19,224 --> 00:55:23,285
And they says, "We don't need
the knowing. We can live here."

323
00:55:23,895 --> 00:55:27,058
"We don't need the knowing.
We can live here."

324
00:55:28,233 --> 00:55:31,566
Time counts and keeps counting.

325
00:55:32,137 --> 00:55:33,900
They gets missing what they had.

326
00:55:34,239 --> 00:55:38,073
They get so lonely for the
high-scrapers and the video.

327
00:55:43,748 --> 00:55:48,412
And they does the pictures so they'd
'member all the knowing that they lost.

328
00:55:59,297 --> 00:56:00,423
'Member this?

329
00:56:00,698 --> 00:56:02,689
Tomorrow-morrow Land!

330
00:56:03,101 --> 00:56:04,591
'Member this?

331
00:56:04,936 --> 00:56:06,767
The River of Light!

332
00:56:07,105 --> 00:56:08,265
'Member this?

333
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:10,269
Skyraft!

334
00:56:10,608 --> 00:56:11,540
'Member this?

335
00:56:12,110 --> 00:56:14,101
Captain Walker!

336
00:56:14,445 --> 00:56:15,434
'Member this?

337
00:56:15,947 --> 00:56:17,107
Mrs. Walker!

338
00:56:20,785 --> 00:56:25,449
Then Captain Walker picked them
of an age and good for a long haul.

339
00:56:25,957 --> 00:56:30,621
They counted 20, and that were them.
The great leaving.

340
00:56:30,828 --> 00:56:33,956
"Rescue party departed
at first light...

341
00:56:34,299 --> 00:56:37,462
"...led by Flight Captain G.L. Walker."

342
00:56:37,669 --> 00:56:41,127
"May God have mercy on our souls."

343
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:44,802
They said bidey-bye to them
what they'd birthed.

344
00:56:45,143 --> 00:56:47,475
And from the nothing they looked back...

345
00:56:47,812 --> 00:56:51,714
...and Captain Walker hollered,
"Wait, one of us will come."

346
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:55,085
"Wait, one of us will come."

347
00:56:57,155 --> 00:56:59,487
And somebody did come.

348
00:56:59,991 --> 00:57:01,856
Walker!

349
00:57:26,517 --> 00:57:28,849
We's heartful to you, Captain Walker.

350
00:57:29,187 --> 00:57:31,917
We's ready now. Take us home.

351
00:57:41,199 --> 00:57:45,363
We kept it straight! Everything marked,
everything 'membered!

352
00:57:45,703 --> 00:57:48,365
You kept it real good.
You ain't been slack.

353
00:57:48,706 --> 00:57:50,037
Why are we waiting for?

354
00:57:50,375 --> 00:57:51,967
You got the wrong guy.

355
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:53,472
Quit joshing!

356
00:57:53,878 --> 00:57:56,540
- Catch the wind.
- We got to see Tomorrow-morrow Land!

357
00:57:56,881 --> 00:57:59,042
Home! Tomorrow-morrow Land!

358
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:08,223
There were places like these.
Cities.

359
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:10,550
They were called cities.

360
00:58:11,396 --> 00:58:14,331
They had lots of knowing.
They had skyscrapers...

361
00:58:15,066 --> 00:58:17,330
...videos, and they had the sonic.

362
00:58:20,405 --> 00:58:21,895
Then this happened.

363
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:26,574
This Pox-Eclipse happened, and it's
finished. It isn't there anymore.

364
00:58:28,246 --> 00:58:31,579
You got to understand
that this is home...

365
00:58:32,417 --> 00:58:35,079
...and there's no Tomorrow-Land...

366
00:58:35,586 --> 00:58:37,520
...and I ain't Captain Walker.

367
00:59:09,253 --> 00:59:10,948
This is it!

368
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:57,494
We's loaded and waiting, Captain.

369
01:00:57,695 --> 01:01:00,858
We got the wind up our arse, Captain.
Let's go!

370
01:02:49,006 --> 01:02:51,167
Who's coming? We's pulling a leaving.

371
01:02:51,676 --> 01:02:55,669
There ain't gonna be no leavings.
All that's just jerking time.

372
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:57,279
We's working it different.

373
01:02:57,582 --> 01:03:00,676
Ain't you seen nothing?
He couldn't catch the wind.

374
01:03:01,018 --> 01:03:04,010
There weren't no skyrafting.
There won't be no salvage.

375
01:03:04,355 --> 01:03:07,119
This is our Tomorrow-morrow Land.
He's proof of that.

376
01:03:07,458 --> 01:03:12,361
Program! All of you program.
If he ain't Captain Walker, who is he?

377
01:03:13,030 --> 01:03:16,022
He ain't no different to us.
He slogged it on foot.

378
01:03:16,701 --> 01:03:18,862
If he can get here, we can get back.

379
01:03:19,203 --> 01:03:20,864
He ain't much bigger than us.

380
01:03:21,205 --> 01:03:23,639
Co-pilot did it. So why can't we?

381
01:03:23,874 --> 01:03:26,206
That's the trick of it. Who's coming?

382
01:03:27,211 --> 01:03:30,374
Across the nothing? Don't you 'member?

383
01:03:30,881 --> 01:03:34,044
When you finded him,
he were half jumped by Mr. Dead.

384
01:03:34,318 --> 01:03:37,048
Nobody's saying it ain't a hard slog.

385
01:03:37,388 --> 01:03:40,152
If we wants the knowing,
it ain't an easy ride.

386
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:42,417
There ain't no knowing!

387
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:46,891
There ain't no skyraft and no sonic.
You slog out there to nothing!

388
01:03:47,231 --> 01:03:48,562
Worse than nothing.

389
01:03:49,066 --> 01:03:52,399
The first place you'll find
is a sleaze-pit called Bartertown.

390
01:03:52,737 --> 01:03:56,070
If the earth doesn't swallow you up,
that place will.

391
01:03:59,076 --> 01:04:02,409
Listen him! There ain't no
Tomorrow-morrow Land!

392
01:04:02,713 --> 01:04:04,408
We done that!

393
01:04:04,749 --> 01:04:06,910
He's got wordstuff out his ass!

394
01:04:07,251 --> 01:04:10,414
Whoever's got the juice, track with us.

395
01:04:52,296 --> 01:04:53,854
Now listen good!

396
01:04:55,299 --> 01:05:00,134
I'm not Captain Walker. I'm the guy
who keeps Mr. Dead in his pocket.

397
01:05:01,472 --> 01:05:03,963
And I say we're gonna stay here.

398
01:05:04,308 --> 01:05:08,301
And we'll live a long time
and we'll be thankful.

399
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:10,344
Right?

400
01:05:12,316 --> 01:05:13,977
Keep tracking.

401
01:06:11,375 --> 01:06:12,865
Get the others.

402
01:07:14,438 --> 01:07:16,770
They've gone.
You got to get them back!

403
01:07:17,107 --> 01:07:21,100
They've gone! ScrooLoose let them go.
There're in the nothing.

404
01:07:21,445 --> 01:07:23,379
Come on, you got to help me!

405
01:07:23,581 --> 01:07:25,776
You got to help me get them back!

406
01:07:28,285 --> 01:07:30,276
Savannah and Gekko.
He can hardly walk.

407
01:07:30,554 --> 01:07:34,547
Little Finn, Mr. Skyfish, and Cusha.
She's gonna pop any day now.

408
01:08:03,754 --> 01:08:04,812
- How long?
- Half a night.

409
01:08:05,055 --> 01:08:06,022
Maybe less.

410
01:08:06,557 --> 01:08:08,991
- They be deep in the nothing.
- Without much water.

411
01:08:09,159 --> 01:08:12,651
It makes no difference.
They'll be swallowed up by the sand.

412
01:08:12,930 --> 01:08:14,397
Get them back, Captain!

413
01:08:14,832 --> 01:08:18,324
Stop with the "Captain."
Stop the noise!

414
01:08:25,509 --> 01:08:26,942
I need as much water
as I can carry.

415
01:08:41,191 --> 01:08:42,351
What are you doing?

416
01:08:42,559 --> 01:08:44,857
I's coming salvage for my buddies.

417
01:08:46,931 --> 01:08:48,626
We needs a hunter.

418
01:10:21,792 --> 01:10:23,987
He holds his own, okay?

419
01:11:35,532 --> 01:11:37,193
Help! Help me!

420
01:13:14,598 --> 01:13:16,429
Quick, let's trek!

421
01:13:30,113 --> 01:13:31,944
Is it Tomorrow-morrow Land?

422
01:13:32,616 --> 01:13:34,948
No. Bartertown.

423
01:13:36,119 --> 01:13:37,950
It's our only chance.

424
01:13:38,956 --> 01:13:40,947
Get in, we're right behind you.

425
01:13:41,291 --> 01:13:43,452
Wait! Stick together!

426
01:13:43,794 --> 01:13:45,125
Where are we?

427
01:13:46,463 --> 01:13:47,452
It's Bartertown.

428
01:13:47,798 --> 01:13:49,789
It stinks!

429
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:52,700
Tubba, Cusha, wait up!

430
01:13:54,738 --> 01:13:56,069
Which way?

431
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,301
Head for the light.

432
01:14:02,646 --> 01:14:04,113
Where are the others?

433
01:14:04,314 --> 01:14:05,645
They've gone ahead.

434
01:14:06,149 --> 01:14:08,481
- How far?
- A long way.

435
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:11,652
- Can you see them?
- Only just!

436
01:14:17,494 --> 01:14:19,655
What are we doing?
What's our program?

437
01:14:19,997 --> 01:14:21,487
We're looking for someone.

438
01:14:21,698 --> 01:14:23,996
In here? This is jerking time!

439
01:14:24,268 --> 01:14:27,999
A little guy with the knowing
of a lot of things. Understand?

440
01:14:28,672 --> 01:14:30,333
Well, shut up!

441
01:14:31,008 --> 01:14:32,669
What's to see, Captain?

442
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:34,170
Quiet!

443
01:14:42,019 --> 01:14:44,852
It's him, Captain! It's the little guy!

444
01:14:45,188 --> 01:14:47,679
Little? He's the smallest!

445
01:14:47,891 --> 01:14:50,553
What the fuck, Captain. What use is he?

446
01:14:50,794 --> 01:14:52,022
Quiet!

447
01:14:54,698 --> 01:14:57,030
- Where are the others?
- Out there.

448
01:15:59,096 --> 01:16:00,586
Screwy, let's fly!

449
01:16:33,630 --> 01:16:34,790
Excuse me.

450
01:17:28,118 --> 01:17:29,346
Hold it!

451
01:17:32,022 --> 01:17:35,856
Remember... no matter where you go,
there you are.

452
01:18:27,844 --> 01:18:29,072
Hi.

453
01:19:15,292 --> 01:19:17,453
All aboard!

454
01:20:14,017 --> 01:20:15,006
Go!

455
01:20:16,186 --> 01:20:17,676
Hang on!

456
01:21:41,604 --> 01:21:44,266
Chase now, pay later.

457
01:22:06,229 --> 01:22:07,093
Bartertown!

458
01:22:07,797 --> 01:22:09,287
Listen to me!

459
01:22:12,969 --> 01:22:14,436
Where are you gonna run?

460
01:22:14,804 --> 01:22:18,137
Where are you gonna hide?
Listen to me!

461
01:22:18,641 --> 01:22:20,632
Bartertown will live!

462
01:22:21,311 --> 01:22:22,972
Find the little man.

463
01:22:23,313 --> 01:22:25,975
Bring him back to me... alive!

464
01:22:26,649 --> 01:22:28,480
We will rebuild!

465
01:22:31,654 --> 01:22:34,987
For those who took him... no mercy!

466
01:23:19,536 --> 01:23:21,527
So, what's the plan?

467
01:23:23,206 --> 01:23:24,138
Plan?

468
01:23:25,008 --> 01:23:26,908
There ain't no plan.

469
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:52,231
Skyfish, look!

470
01:23:55,405 --> 01:23:56,895
It's got to be!

471
01:24:01,578 --> 01:24:03,068
The sonic!

472
01:24:04,247 --> 01:24:06,078
Gekko got it straight.

473
01:24:06,416 --> 01:24:07,713
Delta-Fox-X-Ray.

474
01:24:08,251 --> 01:24:09,343
Come in.

475
01:24:29,606 --> 01:24:32,939
Welcome. Open your book at page one.

476
01:24:35,445 --> 01:24:38,278
Now repeat after me. Bonjour.

477
01:24:39,949 --> 01:24:41,280
Good morning.

478
01:24:46,789 --> 01:24:48,450
Where are you going?

479
01:24:55,965 --> 01:24:57,796
I am going home.

480
01:25:26,596 --> 01:25:27,995
He's got the man!

481
01:27:21,044 --> 01:27:22,511
Ah, Pigkiller!

482
01:29:02,044 --> 01:29:04,535
Blackfinger! Pull the pin!

483
01:29:05,214 --> 01:29:06,875
Do it now!

484
01:29:09,552 --> 01:29:11,213
Hold it, Blackfinger!

485
01:29:26,569 --> 01:29:27,661
Give him back!

486
01:29:28,004 --> 01:29:29,096
Let go!

487
01:29:30,072 --> 01:29:32,063
Blackfinger, let go!

488
01:29:32,275 --> 01:29:34,209
I've got you now, and I'm going home!

489
01:29:36,679 --> 01:29:38,078
You'll be all right.

490
01:30:13,416 --> 01:30:14,405
Come on now!

491
01:31:01,197 --> 01:31:03,529
We're gonna count to 3.

492
01:31:10,206 --> 01:31:11,673
What happened to 2?

493
01:31:29,125 --> 01:31:31,150
This is a stickup!

494
01:31:31,427 --> 01:31:34,919
Anybody moves, and they're dead meat!

495
01:31:40,569 --> 01:31:43,060
I think we're all dead meat!

496
01:32:24,447 --> 01:32:26,915
Dad! We're dead meat!

497
01:32:29,452 --> 01:32:32,285
Quick, get in the plane!

498
01:32:35,291 --> 01:32:36,724
Which way did he go?

499
01:32:36,959 --> 01:32:38,688
I warned you, Dad!

500
01:32:48,304 --> 01:32:49,100
You!

501
01:32:49,372 --> 01:32:50,100
Me?

502
01:32:50,806 --> 01:32:52,831
You. It's your lucky day.

503
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:54,138
It is?

504
01:32:55,111 --> 01:32:56,203
You got a plane.

505
01:32:56,712 --> 01:32:57,542
I have?

506
01:33:02,818 --> 01:33:04,547
It might just save your life.

507
01:33:05,621 --> 01:33:06,383
It will?

508
01:33:34,850 --> 01:33:37,182
All right, let her go!

509
01:33:45,027 --> 01:33:46,494
What's the problem?

510
01:33:46,729 --> 01:33:48,993
We're not gonna get off the ground.

511
01:33:49,198 --> 01:33:50,631
We're overloaded!

512
01:34:21,764 --> 01:34:24,927
Dad, you better do something!

513
01:35:04,039 --> 01:35:06,507
- Kick her in the guts.
- Not gonna make it.

514
01:35:06,876 --> 01:35:08,173
Not enough runway.

515
01:35:08,377 --> 01:35:09,935
We haven't got any choice.

516
01:35:10,212 --> 01:35:11,076
Between them...

517
01:35:11,614 --> 01:35:14,447
...and us, there's not enough runway.

518
01:35:17,620 --> 01:35:18,951
There will be.

519
01:37:57,079 --> 01:37:59,047
Ain't we a pair...

520
01:37:59,715 --> 01:38:01,080
...raggedy-man.

521
01:38:10,292 --> 01:38:11,782
Goodbye, soldier.

522
01:40:11,547 --> 01:40:15,074
This you knows. The years travel fast.

523
01:40:15,584 --> 01:40:18,417
And time after time I've done the Tell.

524
01:40:18,921 --> 01:40:22,880
But this ain't one body's Tell.
It's the Tell of us all.

525
01:40:23,425 --> 01:40:26,087
And you got to listen it and 'member.

526
01:40:26,595 --> 01:40:31,259
'Cause what you hears today,
you got to tell the newborn tomorrow.

527
01:40:31,934 --> 01:40:35,927
I's looking behind us now,
into history back.

528
01:40:36,271 --> 01:40:40,435
I sees those of us that got the luck
and started the haul for home.

529
01:40:40,742 --> 01:40:43,677
It lead us here and we was heartful...

530
01:40:43,879 --> 01:40:45,972
...'cause we seen what there once was.

531
01:40:46,949 --> 01:40:50,282
One look, and we knewed
we'd got it straight.

532
01:40:50,786 --> 01:40:55,280
Those who had gone before had knowing
of things beyond our reckoning...

533
01:40:55,624 --> 01:40:57,615
...even beyond our dreaming.

534
01:40:59,127 --> 01:41:01,960
Time counts and keeps counting.

535
01:41:02,798 --> 01:41:04,459
And we knows now...

536
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:08,793
...finding the trick of what's
been and lost ain't no easy ride.

537
01:41:09,638 --> 01:41:12,801
But that's our track.
We got to travel it.

538
01:41:13,141 --> 01:41:15,974
And there ain't nobody knows
where it's gonna lead.

539
01:41:17,145 --> 01:41:20,979
Still and all, every night
we does the Tell...

540
01:41:21,316 --> 01:41:25,309
...so that we 'member who we was
and where we came from.

541
01:41:26,154 --> 01:41:29,646
But most of all we 'members
the man who finded us...

542
01:41:30,325 --> 01:41:32,316
...him that came the salvage.

543
01:41:32,661 --> 01:41:35,824
And we lights the city.
Not just for him...

544
01:41:36,164 --> 01:41:38,826
...but for all of them
that are still out there.

545
01:41:39,334 --> 01:41:41,996
'Cause we knows there'll come a night...

546
01:41:42,337 --> 01:41:44,498
...when they sees the distant light...

547
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:46,831
...and they'll be coming home.
