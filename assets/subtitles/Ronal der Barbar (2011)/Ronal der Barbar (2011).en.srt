1
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,990
In the beginning there was only darkness.

2
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,870
And in the darkness born demon Zaal, -

3
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,230
- Zakidernes ruler -

4
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,590
- And the human oppressor.

5
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:35,830
But from the shadows came Crane,
warrior of all warriors -

6
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,430
- And the bearer of the gods' swords.

7
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,230
He liberated man -

8
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,430
- And led them to victory.

9
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,190
But the price of victory was high.

10
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,270
For Crane got an ulcer
through the heart, -

11
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:29,270
- Who bled for seven days
and seven nights.

12
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,990
And a hundred warriors
drank his blood.

13
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,670
And parades his strength.

14
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:48,550
And Crane looked at them
and saw that it was good.

15
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,270
And then he died.

16
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:58,430
Thus was created the barbarians, -

17
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,990
- Sons of Crane.

18
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,350
Oh, yeah.
(Roars)

19
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,070
Yes.

20
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,470
(Source sounds)
(Someone clears his throat)

21
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:03,590
Listen, folks.
Strength! Mod! Fearlessness!

22
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,390
This is what
there was a wreath gift to our people.

23
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:10,990
For thousands of generations,
Generation after generation, -

24
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,350
- Has his blood rushing
undiluted in our veins.

25
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:18,830
This is what we celebrate every year,
before we go on expeditions.

26
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,430
But first and foremost
is the crown of blood that makes -

27
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:27,070
- That we are barbarians
the greatest warriors throughout Metalonien.

28
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,710
Okay, Ronal, it's your turn.

29
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,590
Ronal is sick ...
(Switch pitch)

30
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,070
Ronal is sick today.

31
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,310
Ronal!

32
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:40,990
Can not jump over me?
I have a sore elbow.

33
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,310
Maybe I'm getting
late skin ... vagina ...

34
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:48,350
- Shin Inflammation.
- Hell, Ronal.

35
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,990
Put all your power in battle.

36
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:58,230
I'm looking
eddermaneme to see.

37
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,950
(Screams småtøset)

38
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,390
(Pain flare)

39
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,230
(Gedebrægen)

40
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:22,750
Oh, for Christ's sake, Ronal, man.

41
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,390
One to.

42
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,910
Can ...

43
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,910
... eh ...

44
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,190
... more!

45
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,030
You may keep you
in shape before the cruise.

46
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,630
A barbarian who do not
can swing an ax, is ... uh ...

47
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,990
At least not any real barbarians.

48
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,310
What should I quest?
I walk in the way.

49
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:46,270
- Can not I hang out here?
- You are the son of the Crane.

50
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:50,630
A son of Crane draws on expeditions and
killing monsters and returning in glory.

51
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:55,150
- It is the essence of being a barbarian.
- Uncle, look at me.

52
00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:01,190
What should I do to monsters? Buckle
muscle suit and hope they die of laughter?

53
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,590
What then, Ronal?
Have you got a mullet?

54
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,470
Fucking funny. Have you got
any brain cells?

55
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:13,790
What? Where? If there is one on the back,
bother you then press it out?

56
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:18,110
Listen here, kid. When you go on expeditions,
is it about big balls -

57
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,830
- Than the arms. Heroism.

58
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:25,590
Once you've grasped it, it is
no problem to crush the enemy.

59
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:30,310
I just find it difficult to overlook
that you just can die from it!

60
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,430
Hold on just shut up and train.

61
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,590
(Horse whinny)

62
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,310
What is it?

63
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,990
(Deep honk)

64
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:57,590
The alarm. All hands to arms!
At your seats! Move!

65
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:03,110
- Hop, hop!
- Yes, yes!

66
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,430
Barricades gate!

67
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,310
Come on! Pull to!

68
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:18,310
Up on the barricades, I lusepustere!

69
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:30,190
Tranquil.

70
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:39,590
Wait.

71
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,590
Quiet!

72
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,390
Who's there?

73
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:55,830
Hail, noble savages.
We are Master Florian, -

74
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,230
- Kvadskriver and bard.

75
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:01,710
We simply want
humble towards payment of course -

76
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:06,710
- To enrich your
banquet you muscles spectaculaires -

77
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:12,190
- With noble sonatas for your old
heroes and heroines.

78
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,950
(A flute trill)

79
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,070
(Roars)

80
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,710
Attack!

81
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:33,910
- Songs. They sing songs at parties.
- Fester?

82
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:38,390
Try for example to check
their incredibly dangerous tuba on the roof.

83
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,110
So slip into.

84
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,990
- No!
- Damn.

85
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:46,790
It's bloody hundred years ago,
I finally cracked a forehead peel.

86
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:50,110
How the hell should I know
it was a tuba?

87
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,830
Yo, girls. How about
to wash my sick virile, -

88
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:01,470
- Resilient, filthy -

89
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,510
- Firstrengede lute?

90
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:07,710
There shall be practiced songs, not frivolous,
young Alibert. The art call.

91
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,430
We must be ready.

92
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:13,510
Is not there just a little bit of time
to walk around and look?

93
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:17,790
A true bard
Remember all the songs perfectly.

94
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:21,590
How perfect does this happen?
Should not we raiding?

95
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,750
Barbarians must leave tomorrow.
We could carry.

96
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:28,230
Fluctuate with the ears.
I have to meet girls, man.

97
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:31,310
I think
write some heroic poem.

98
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,790
Or something like that,
You know, with those verses.

99
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:38,310
Oh, young Alibert.
Only when you all sang, -

100
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,910
- There is the poem, you like that.

101
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:46,270
- What? It will take 100 years.
- Nonsense. So long does not.

102
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:50,670
I was only 57 before I was
finished his apprenticeship. It has no age.

103
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,990
Ouch! Fucking tight.

104
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:56,350
ka 'Rikke ka' Rikke
ka 'Rikke drink beer?

105
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,950
ka 'Rikke
ka 'Rikke ka' Rikke drink beer?

106
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,670
Oh, it's good, man.

107
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:11,550
Is there one of you pattebørn,
can guzzle a cheeky pint?

108
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:14,110
(Burp)

109
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:18,150
Alibert!

110
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:20,310
So I was hunting -

111
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:24,350
- And then you see me just run into
in a orkbørnehave. Hopla.

112
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:28,190
- Here you go, honey. On you.
- Oh, how cute.

113
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,990
Yes, it makes your eyes.
This one also must look straight.

114
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:35,350
It is a true
invisibility body lotion.

115
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:38,470
I used it,
when I snuck into a harem.

116
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:41,150
Cool, no? Total listepik.

117
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:44,590
So you can not see
who is attacking.

118
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,710
What is it? Hey, there it was again.
And now it stopped.

119
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:51,390
- Now it came again.
- Ouch, Gorak. Now let be.

120
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:55,350
- It will not stop.
- Satan and hell, you fat fool!

121
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:58,350
Oh, Ronal, damn man.

122
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:11,950
(Ansporingslyde and whiplash)

123
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,630
(Whiplash and groans)

124
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,950
All bearings sons are assembled,
Prince Volcazar.

125
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,350
Then it's time.

126
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,390
(Evil laughter)

127
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,470
(A fart)

128
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:00,630
- Can not I take the guard a little?
- What about the party?

129
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:04,030
I'm just so ... a little tired.

130
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:08,310
Okay, then. Remember to blow the horn,
if you see something suspicious.

131
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:12,390
- Think you can handle it?
- It is like when røvligemeget.

132
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:15,350
- I want to be alone.
- It's a great horn.

133
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:19,870
Remember, breathe into.
Deep down in my stomach. And so ...

134
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:23,670
Damn, Uncle.
Who would attack us?

135
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:27,390
We're fucking barbarians.
We have smashed everything.

136
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:31,070
- We have never been attacked.
- It may well be.

137
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,470
But it is the principle of it,
which is important.

138
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:38,310
The boy takes the life of me one day.

139
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,510
TRIP-MAGAZINE

140
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:46,710
Fucking barbarians, man.

141
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:03,030
What the hell is this?

142
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:34,430
(Insane laughter)

143
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:38,750
We are being attacked?
We are attacked!

144
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,670
Take your weapon!

145
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,830
(Breathe in)

146
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,590
(A weak blæselyd)

147
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,750
(The check sum)

148
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,910
No, no!

149
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:59,430
- We listen and sounds!
- Let hell rain down.

150
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,790
Fuck! Fuck!

151
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,870
(Breath sounds)

152
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,430
Fire!

153
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:16,710
To the attack! Show no weakness!

154
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:24,550
- Look! Fireworks!
- Have we booked it?

155
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:29,470
(Insane laughter)

156
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:38,950
We are attacked!
Barbarians, defend you!

157
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,030
Hop, hop, hop!

158
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:51,190
Oh, heaven be praised.
They are rescued.

159
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:54,590
Are you mad a sick fucking party, man.

160
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:59,190
- Bummer!
- No!

161
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:04,430
Help! Help!

162
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,750
Dush! Smack!

163
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,830
Bash! Muscles!

164
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,350
(Evil laughter)

165
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:38,750
(Roar of pain)

166
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:43,830
Now I do not think
there are more back.

167
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,390
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

168
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,350
He's mine.

169
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,430
(Roar)

170
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:57,110
We are overrun.
Why was blowing you not?

171
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,590
- I tried!
- You tried?

172
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,790
"Trying" is just not good enough, Ronal.

173
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:05,230
Jump up. We must rescue the others.

174
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,390
(Evil laughter)

175
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,910
The famous sons of Crane.

176
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:28,630
How pathetic.

177
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:33,590
Put them in chains.
No one shall be left.

178
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,910
We Barbarians subjecting us never!

179
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,630
(Evil laughter)

180
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:09,230
Everyone must obey me ...

181
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,950
No!

182
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,950
... or die!

183
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,310
No!

184
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:22,510
- Before them away.
- L heard Prince Volcazar!

185
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:26,190
Get the last barbarians in the cart.
Come on!

186
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,950
In with him! Move!

187
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:31,670
- Come here!
- Well I will not ...

188
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:34,550
- In with them!
- What the hell?

189
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:37,030
Remember your shoes and handbags ... axes!

190
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,630
We do not come back
and pick them up!

191
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,990
General? The here
prisoner does not fit the shackles.

192
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:46,910
- Should I just throw him away?
- That is, it's not a barbarian.

193
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:50,870
- Pull him from behind and killing shit.
- Oh, thank you.

194
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:53,990
- Lucky bastard.
- It is always the one who gets.

195
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:58,630
- Buff it feels good
- Buff it feels good

196
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:03,870
- As a bonus it is really nice
- As a bonus it is really nice

197
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:07,070
sits well
feels good

198
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:13,630
No, I will not. Help! Help!

199
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:24,110
Shut up,
I get boner of it here.

200
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:31,310
Oh, man. Shit, one night, man.

201
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:34,910
My head, man.
The town is pretty knackered, what?

202
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:38,230
Where are all the others gone?

203
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,950
Are they taken to the afterparty?
Hey, wait, you!

204
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,550
Ro ... Ronal.

205
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,470
Uncle. You live.

206
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,670
Not long yet.

207
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,950
Crane ... call me home.

208
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:13,510
No, uncle,
it is probably just a ... flesh wounds.

209
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:17,830
Ronal when your parents died
I swore to take care of you.

210
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:23,150
And the promise I have kept. But now
it's your turn to promise anything.

211
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:27,790
Promise me that you want to save the others.
You owe them.

212
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:31,790
- What? No, but I can not.
- Promise me that!

213
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:36,070
- But ...
- Travel north to the oracle.

214
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:40,990
- He will help you.
- Oracle? How?

215
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,750
(Coughs)

216
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,790
You are the only hope, Ronal.

217
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:50,910
The only barbarian, is left.

218
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:54,310
(Dødssuk)

219
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:57,910
Uncle? Uncle?

220
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,990
Uncle?

221
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:25,190
Goraks invisibility cream.

222
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,310
Yo.

223
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:34,150
- What happens? Going on an expedition?
- Uh, no. I must find the others.

224
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,190
Well, okay.

225
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:40,830
- It's a trip. You need to raid!
- No. I must find my village.

226
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:43,830
It's very sick a raid.
Wait a minute.

227
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:47,190
- Who are you?
- Hello. Alibert, bard.

228
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,790
Damn nice to be followed.

229
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:53,870
You can not say no;
because I just goes anyway.

230
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:57,990
Now we are out walking around, we saw
not slip past the Amazons country?

231
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:01,790
- No.
- The girls down there would be lovely.

232
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,870
- It must be investigated.
- Try to hear.

233
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:08,990
- Do not follow me.
- Those girls are super horny.

234
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:12,350
- No!
- Fuck, you're boring, man.

235
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:18,190
Now I know what we do. We take
to Berylia. There are ladies' tails.

236
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,230
And four teats! It could be
for the sick, man!

237
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:24,950
- No, it could not.
- Come on. What are we here?

238
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:30,110
- I must talk to an oracle.
- Is it a kind of tourist?

239
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,670
(Surprised outbreaks)

240
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:37,390
Sick crib.

241
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,350
Hello?

242
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:52,430
- Hello?
- It was sateme time.

243
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:55,830
I've been sitting here since last Wednesday.
Are you coming or what?

244
00:20:55,990 --> 00:21:00,630
- Sorry, what?
- I like when dried, to heck.

245
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,990
Is not home care?

246
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,910
- No, we ...
- Wait!

247
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,310
(Fart and shit sounds)

248
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:11,110
Gundars have sent ...

249
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:15,750
That's it. Come right ahead.
And be careful with haemorrhoids.

250
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:20,870
(Sniffer and expels gasp)

251
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,430
(Coughs and Harker)

252
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:28,150
He is a mighty warlord
this prince Volcazar that you are talking about.

253
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:31,910
zakidernes dark force protects him.

254
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:38,230
Now I was so seen nor
interested in fighting with him.

255
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:42,030
Volcazar crave power
across Metalonien.

256
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:45,710
So far, no
been able to stop him.

257
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,750
Wow.

258
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:53,350
(Exhibitions)

259
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,990
(Laughs)

260
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:11,190
(Coughs and spits)

261
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:18,150
An impenetrable armor encloses
his body. No weapon bites on him.

262
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:22,790
Only one sword has strength
to crush him.

263
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,910
See.

264
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:37,110
- Oh, sick.
- What's so special about it?

265
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:42,390
It should especially you know, barbarians.
This is the crown of swords.

266
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:50,110
It's a joke, right?

267
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:56,350
Honestly, it do not exist.
Everybody has been looking for the damn sword -

268
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:59,670
- In thousands of years,
and nobody has found it.

269
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:02,230
It's a silly story.

270
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:07,150
Wreath sword is not a myth.
Only this can damage the princes Volcazar.

271
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:11,390
You can never save your village
outside to get at him first.

272
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,990
But I can not.

273
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:17,710
Only a great warrior without fear
the heart will be able to use it.

274
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:21,070
Without a great warrior
You will not defeat Volcazar.

275
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:25,270
And without a great warrior
would your tribe be damned!

276
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:33,350
But I can also be indifferent.
I'm just a pundit.

277
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:38,510
It's not my fault
that the barbarians have been kidnapped, do you?

278
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,750
Gu'ra zul!

279
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:28,190
Wizard!

280
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:32,630
Lord, time is fast approaching.
zakidernes temple must be awakened soon.

281
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:36,950
Otherwise it becomes impossible to perform
the ritual. Is Wreath sons caught?

282
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:42,190
- My mission is complete.
- Fantastic. Now nothing can stop us.

283
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:46,870
Mighty zaal. Wreath sons are gathered.

284
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:49,230
Awake from your lethargy!

285
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:51,070
(Exhibitions)

286
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:53,830
What is happening?

287
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:56,310
Finally.

288
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,470
- What?
- What now?

289
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:12,790
The mighty Zaal is not satisfied.
The absence of one son of Crane.

290
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:16,950
- Impossible. Unless ...
- I do not understand ...

291
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:19,870
- We left none alive.
- Fool!

292
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:25,110
I need the blood of all living
barbarians, and then you let one escape.

293
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:30,270
- I can not explain.
- Find him for me. Now!

294
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:35,350
for they are in raid
Alibert and Ronal

295
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:39,950
the greatest heroes
in Metalonien

296
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:43,510
uh-uh
it's going so well

297
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:48,070
and the girls they say

298
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,830
Alibert
you're so delicious

299
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:56,350
My village has been burned,
and I must find Wreath sword.

300
00:25:56,510 --> 00:26:00,710
Can not the devil be quiet
for five minutes so that I can think of?

301
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:06,550
- I sing a song barbarian instead.
- For God's sake, no.

302
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:10,990
Crane and he drew his proud sword
and drove with all his force

303
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:14,350
blade deep in Zakidens must
skull burst

304
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:17,590
Wait a minute. The song.
What was it?

305
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,710
"Lays Wreath".

306
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:23,390
There are 2073 verses
and I do them all by heart.

307
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:26,150
Crane gets totally much pussy.

308
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:29,670
- Why did not you say something?
- That he gets pussy?

309
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:32,790
No, about the song. It's about Crane.

310
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:38,270
You have sung a verse of his sword.
Is there one that tells you where it is?

311
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:42,630
from the crown of his chest the blood flowed
it was bleeding day and night

312
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:45,190
No no. After he dies. Come on. Sing.

313
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:48,830
his grave was placed the sword
Instead, now forgotten

314
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:53,270
Only Wisdom Book of Elves Farm
knows where it is stored

315
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:56,670
Wisdom book of Elves Farm.
That's it.

316
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:59,270
- We need to Elf Farm.
- Should we do it?

317
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:03,390
- This is how you find the sword!
- Girls are Elven pishamrende delicious.

318
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:06,630
It will be a great trip, it here.

319
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:11,430
Okay, I have two rules here at the
turn. A: This is not a raid.

320
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:17,470
And two: Do ​​we have something that is
smallest expedition-style, we go around it.

321
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:20,070
- Is it a deal?
- Check.

322
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:31,950
Is that rule number one or two
we've just violated?

323
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:35,230
Run for your life.

324
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:39,270
Shit! What the hell is this?

325
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,710
What the hell was that?

326
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,910
(Scream)

327
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,110
No! No!

328
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,790
Ouch!

329
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:11,430
(Choking sounds)

330
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:17,270
- Who are you? Are you one of them?
- My ... my neck.

331
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:19,590
Answer me!

332
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:23,310
I'm just a random
passersby. I swear.

333
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:26,790
It was not my opinion
to disturb you in the middle of your ...

334
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:31,550
- Slaughter of random men.
- They challenged me to a duel.

335
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,110
Oh no, not again.

336
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:37,310
(Whining and crying)

337
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:43,910
Get out of here.
You may be allowed to live.

338
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:50,590
She is like when the warrior
we need to crown a sword.

339
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:54,390
What? Are you insane?
She is fucking violent psychopath.

340
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:57,470
- Yes, exactly. Ask her.
- No.

341
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:02,270
Wanker. Yo, pretty. My friend Ronal
would like to ask you something.

342
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:05,150
Will a fresh krigertøs as you -

343
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:09,270
- Out on such an expedition, you know.
In order to save his village.

344
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:15,830
And as a little bonus, I would like
let you play a little on my father's lute.

345
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:18,830
I do not know what he's talking about.

346
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:23,510
put your hand on my lute
and let me teach you to suck '

347
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:26,790
I will not learn to play
on your instrument.

348
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:30,870
- You are well expensive.
- I said it was not a good idea.

349
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:33,430
Another must rescue the barbarians.

350
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:37,190
- Did you barbarians?
- Um, yes.

351
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:40,510
- The barbarians, it is your village?
- Oh, yes.

352
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:44,590
Them, as they say,
are the greatest warriors in Metalonien?

353
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,790
Yes.

354
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:50,950
It's a worthy cause.
I'll take with you.

355
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,630
What?

356
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:55,750
I'm Zandra from skjoldmøernes clan.

357
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:58,390
- Where are you going?
- Elf kingdom.

358
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:01,550
- We must find out where it is.
- We will need a guide.

359
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:05,710
- There is a nearby city. Come.
- No, wait. You can not just ...

360
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:09,270
- Do you have a problem with that?
- Now ... uh, no.

361
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:14,470
- Super. Come.
- I swear you scoop her husband.

362
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,630
(Sniff)

363
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:28,830
Son of Crane! Son of Crane!

364
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:33,590
Come on! Faster!

365
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,950
Oh, cool.

366
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:02,910
Shaving my legs and call me Susan,
if this is the sickest place.

367
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:08,390
- Okay, we are here.
- Uh, okay.

368
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,790
What's up there, assholes?

369
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:14,670
Is there not one of you
who cares to call a taxi?

370
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:17,590
- Fuck.
- Grease. There is happy hour.

371
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:21,030
There are many in there today.
Stay behind me.

372
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:24,630
We walk quietly in,
find a directory -

373
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:27,750
- And go again
before any notice to us.

374
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:30,910
And without a fight, okay?

375
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:35,110
Please?

376
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:38,510
- As you wish.
- Thank you.

377
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:45,430
Bing, Bing-li-bing-bing.
l your ass.

378
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,750
(Fugleskræppen)

379
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:57,110
Son of Crane! Son of Crane!

380
00:31:57,270 --> 00:32:01,830
So I said to her: "Your breasts
looks tired. Should I keep them? "

381
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:05,350
Your mother has always
had the longest tits.

382
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:09,950
Hey! Hey! Now stop you, buddy.

383
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:13,390
I tell you.
She was angry, man.

384
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:17,950
You can not win them all.
But you can try.

385
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:24,350
(Elf tobakshoster)

386
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:28,270
- What do you want?
- We are looking for a guide.

387
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:34,550
There is only one left. Down by
privy. Ask for Elric.

388
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:38,390
Hey, who ordered a pint
and a double Manhattan?

389
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:40,110
Okay. Thank you.

390
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:50,350
Uh, hey. Uh, you're Elric?

391
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:54,350
Devoted to vote
lights in the evening sun's embrace.

392
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:58,910
Stellar Kids
Head Mother Sol to rest.

393
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:02,990
l dark sounds
pensive sigh sake.

394
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:08,150
I sensed you'd come. We
elves are connected with all living things.

395
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:11,390
Let our souls meet.

396
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:16,350
You bear the eagle fantasy
and scrotum mouse will.

397
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:21,270
Copper beech music rests in your heart.
Kormamin lindua ka'elja.

398
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:25,910
Yes, it sounds exciting. My name is
Ronal and we have some pieces ...

399
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,830
(Tysser)

400
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:34,030
Names have no meaning.

401
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:38,990
- I need ...
- Spiritual or physical directions?

402
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,350
We need to Elf Farm.

403
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:45,710
Devoted voice will tell me
though I must help you. Stand still!

404
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:51,710
Let me penetrate your aura.
Kormamin lindua ka'elja.

405
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:54,470
Kormamin lindua ...

406
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:59,830
The wind tells me to follow you.
My bow will sing with your sword.

407
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:01,870
(Kissing sounds)

408
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:03,830
Okay ...

409
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:09,150
(Pain flare)
For hell.

410
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:12,950
- Hey, I found him.
- My bow will sing with your sword.

411
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:15,950
Yes. Come, let us hasten out.

412
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:21,430
Hey, skjoldmø, you go already?

413
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:24,750
What do you say to a little dance?

414
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:34,270
Hey guys, sorry,
it's okay. We go now.

415
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:38,310
- I accept your challenge.
- What?

416
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:40,750
You may defeat me or die.

417
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:44,430
- We should not create problems.
- They challenged me.

418
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:48,070
You promised. In and out without a fight.

419
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:52,190
Okay. So, you control it all by herself.

420
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:55,470
Hey, skjoldmø, what is it for?

421
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,590
Listen ...

422
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:01,910
Friends, I know, I think
it's super cool to declare -

423
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:08,310
- But we have a bit busy, and there
is probably plenty here who want to fight, -

424
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:12,590
- So if that's okay with you,
I think just, we slip.

425
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:15,270
(Laughter and heckling)

426
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:21,470
- Zandra!
- I do not mix myself.

427
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:27,910
Lovely suppeben it here.

428
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,950
So ride, however, properly!

429
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:39,550
Have you seen this one before?
I can teach you to play it.

430
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:42,430
Make it you horny?

431
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:48,350
I sense
great aggressiveness in the room.

432
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:54,630
Any last words that stump?

433
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:57,790
- He is dead.
- What the hell?

434
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:00,630
It is damn
too nauseating.

435
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:05,070
- Now you can get a new asshole.
- It is enough. Let him be.

436
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:14,230
Black Riders.

437
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:25,270
(Sniff)

438
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:27,830
Son of Crane! Son of Crane!

439
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:30,950
- Take him!
- No! Help!

440
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:33,230
(Fighting war)

441
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:38,030
Zandra!

442
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:43,310
Nobody sits up against the Prince
Volcazars riders go unpunished!

443
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:47,630
It explodes!

444
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:49,510
Move!

445
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:59,110
Hello! Who is it who ordered
a double Manhattan?

446
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:01,630
Ouch, my ass!

447
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:02,830
1 10% ALCOHOL

448
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:04,190
Curse!

449
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:17,310
(Stifled sounds)
(Evil laughter)

450
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:22,110
Fabulous, my lord. One hits more
and you have beaten your record.

451
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:26,670
But we must find the last
Son of Crane before the next full moon.

452
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:30,630
- You destroy my concentration.
- I beg your pardon.

453
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,950
(Mobile ringtone)

454
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:37,230
- Hello?
- The target escaped, sir.

455
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:41,750
The task is harder than we thought.
He enlists the help of a strong warrior.

456
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:44,470
We will need reinforcement.

457
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:47,150
I tolerate no insults!

458
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:50,910
Bring them to me. Both of them.

459
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:06,950
Do you know where we are?
It seems as if we go in circles.

460
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:11,350
The wind speaks to my soul.
We are soon in elves' realm.

461
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:15,310
You said that two days ago.
We're lost, dammit.

462
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:17,470
We die of thirst.

463
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:20,470
- Ha.
- What is it that's so funny?

464
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:24,710
I have heard of barbarians against and
strength, but you have neither.

465
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:27,510
You just go and whine and hiss.

466
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:31,110
It's funny when you consider
the family you come from.

467
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:34,750
Why are you with
if you think I whining?

468
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:37,870
- What is your deal with the barbarians?
- It's my own affair.

469
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:40,670
Stop! See.

470
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:48,550
- And that means ...?
- We elves can communicate with everything.

471
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:53,230
I unite myself with its soul
and causes it to show us the output.

472
00:38:53,390 --> 00:39:00,790
Kormamin lindua ka'elja.

473
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:03,430
Kormamin lindua ...

474
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:07,270
Ouch! My beautiful elf lip!

475
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:23,590
There. On the other side. There is no
maze on the other side.

476
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:30,030
The entrance to the elven kingdom.

477
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:32,750
I did it.

478
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:44,470
Elves Port, I greet you.

479
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:49,710
Did you not think it was an entrance?

480
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:52,590
(Grinding)

481
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:12,870
- Oh! Wild!
- Come on.

482
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:17,230
Stop! First, our souls are weighed
the gatekeeper.

483
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:24,030
Only those of the right casting
may be allowed to go through.

484
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:27,230
What about those
not have the proper casting?

485
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:30,590
Who? Well.
They are crushed by the rock wall.

486
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:34,030
- Well, shall we go?
- Well it I can not.

487
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:37,670
- What?
- I am a miserable barbarian.

488
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:40,430
I have not exactly
the right casting.

489
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:45,270
- It is not meant that way.
- Forget it. We go around it.

490
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:48,430
When you are on the raid,
, follow the directory.

491
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:52,150
The only thing we get out of it
is to be killed.

492
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:56,350
But now you call it a raid,
remember that it is my cruise.

493
00:40:56,510 --> 00:41:00,670
And I decide that we go outside
the ridiculous port. Come on!

494
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:12,990
See. No booby traps, no gates,
no anything.

495
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:17,830
This expedition-nonsense is so predictable.
If just thinking a bit outside ...

496
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,230
(Scream)

497
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:27,950
- Ouch, my tailbone, man.
- What the hell was that?

498
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:31,750
We have offended gatekeeper.
I sense ...

499
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:34,110
... great danger!

500
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:36,350
Run!

501
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,670
Faster!

502
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:48,790
Ronal!

503
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:54,630
Come!

504
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:04,070
Ouch, man.

505
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:07,830
Fool! Your moronic idea was
to beat us all to death.

506
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:12,190
I tried just
to steer us out of trouble.

507
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:16,350
You tried? Here the "samples"
just not good enough, Ronal.

508
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:19,750
On a mission
there will always be problems.

509
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:23,070
Solve them instead of going around it.

510
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:36,070
This is the Elves Temple.

511
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:39,910
The focal point
of all wisdom in the world.

512
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:46,510
Wisdom book of lies
in the tower's upper chamber -

513
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:51,310
- So the moon can read in the
on his journey across the night sky.

514
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:54,350
It is the holiest of holies.

515
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:57,830
- Fair enough. So is it that we have to get up.
- Hush!

516
00:42:57,990 --> 00:42:59,630
See.

517
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:06,190
No one from outside should get into. The King
Archers have eyes like hawks.

518
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:08,190
(Pipes)

519
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:20,230
- Shit.
- They kill everything they see.

520
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:35,310
So it must be the hard way.
I take the front two.

521
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:37,990
No.

522
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:40,310
- I do it.
- What?

523
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:42,510
Alone.

524
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:45,790
Think about it. They kill you,
as soon as they see you.

525
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:47,910
I know, -

526
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:51,190
- But they will not see me.

527
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:55,590
There is not much left
and I am the least of us. Wait here.

528
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:59,670
This one I could
have used in high school.

529
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:02,910
What do l do? Smart, no?

530
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:08,350
- What?
- You are missing a spot.

531
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:13,790
Fuck! It is empty.
Fuck, it's typical.

532
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:18,270
Relax, Ronal. They are small dumplings
Nobody will notice.

533
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:22,150
- Wait here.
- Let be, Ronal. You will be killed.

534
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:28,190
Ouch!

535
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:35,310
"I have a headache," "I'm tired"
"The kids wake up!" And blah, blah, blah.

536
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:38,030
With such a wife is the bummer,
one lives forever.

537
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:39,510
Røvnederen!

538
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:40,990
Ouch!

539
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:43,190
Who's there?

540
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:50,110
Well, there was not a damn thing anyway.

541
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:54,550
- What then? Are you ready for this Saturday?
- Are you crazy? I was born ready!

542
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:58,270
- Coolest!
- I just have to be psycho-baskelam!

543
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:01,710
(Footsteps, breathing and groans)

544
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:11,350
There is open.

545
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:18,390
Ouch!

546
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:34,590
Fuck, I'm in bad shape.

547
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:56,030
Oh!

548
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:00,190
(Groan)

549
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:03,790
(Alarm sound)

550
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:09,390
(Gasps)

551
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:12,270
Accursed rat!

552
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:23,710
Oh!

553
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:34,590
Wow. There it is.

554
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:45,030
So what is what here?
Wreath sword -

555
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:49,270
- Wreath sword
how the hell finderjeg Wreath sword?

556
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:52,310
There's that damn.

557
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:56,270
Wreath sword.
Well, but it was easy enough.

558
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:00,470
It's like when no one
who discovers.

559
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:02,710
(Cries)

560
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:05,070
(Pain cry)

561
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:08,430
- A killer rat!
- Kill the rat!

562
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:12,110
Use the poisoned arrows.

563
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:15,030
After it!

564
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:19,390
Kill it! Kill it! Kill it!

565
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:23,670
Faster!
Shoot it down!

566
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:28,430
- Ow, damn it!
- Yes! Pig is down!

567
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:31,990
(Cries)

568
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:42,230
Well, how much
takes you to drink?

569
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:46,390
- Nothing. I'll smoke me on the floor.
- Did you get hold of Elrond mother's weed?

570
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:12,150
Av.

571
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:21,230
The card says that Crane was
buried in eternity Mountain.

572
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:24,710
My elfin soul feel
it is far, far ...

573
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:26,990
Is not it there?

574
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:30,990
... it is just nearby.
Destiny is on our side.

575
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:33,230
Av.

576
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:34,790
Not.

577
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:36,710
(Clears his throat)

578
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:39,990
- I mistook you.
- What?

579
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:42,910
There in the temple. You did it.

580
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:46,750
Yes, almost certainly.
You do barbarians honor.

581
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:49,910
Uh. Thank you.

582
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:55,150
Well, but ... I have also
an ax to be sanded.

583
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:57,590
I got to thinking ...

584
00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:01,190
I've never really been told ...

585
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:04,830
... thanks for that you took with me.

586
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:08,990
Actually anerjeg not know how
would have done it without you.

587
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:11,630
Uh ... okay.

588
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:18,430
Well, we'd better get some sleep.
Maybe we crown the sword tomorrow.

589
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:23,070
I keep watch. We elves do
no sleep. I can safely sleep.

590
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:28,870
- May I ask you something, Ronal?
- Uh, yes, of course.

591
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:31,750
How are the barbarians?

592
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:35,550
- They're not very clever.
- I thought more ...

593
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:38,550
How are they here?

594
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:42,230
Well.

595
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:44,070
Uh.

596
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:48,950
A barbarian is always ready to help
one when you need it.

597
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:53,470
Regardless of how dangerous and disruptive
it is. And they go on raids constant.

598
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:58,510
They are not afraid of anything.
Hard to believe I am one of them, huh?

599
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:03,550
- And they are good fighters, right?
- Yep. The best in the world.

600
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:07,150
It's just so hard
to find a decent fighter.

601
00:50:07,310 --> 00:50:09,550
Yes. Uh, what?

602
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:13,390
I come from
an ancient lineage of skjoldmøer.

603
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:16,110
Far, far away from here.

604
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:22,110
Our religion requires that I only
marry the one who can defeat me.

605
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:29,430
Many have tried
to win over me -

606
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:31,670
- But I was too strong.

607
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:36,070
And for every duel I won,
I was just stronger.

608
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:40,150
Meanwhile, I could only watch as
the other found himself a girlfriend.

609
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:44,430
One by one. Eventually I was
the only one left.

610
00:50:44,590 --> 00:50:48,990
It took longer and longer
between that someone dared to challenge me.

611
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:52,950
Then the suitors just up
get.

612
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:56,230
The top of the trunk
became impatient.

613
00:50:56,390 --> 00:51:01,430
They told me to go into
world to find a worthy husband.

614
00:51:01,590 --> 00:51:05,230
A warrior with the strength
to defeat me.

615
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:11,070
If one kills me,
I will obey his slightest command.

616
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:14,070
There have been no,
who were strong enough.

617
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:19,070
But everywhere I've been, say,
Barbarians are the strongest warriors -

618
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:22,550
- So maybe a barbarian
from your village meet me.

619
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:26,270
- That's why I went with you.
- Uh ... Okay.

620
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:28,670
- Okay, what?
- Well, then ...

621
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:32,670
What you just said,
what it has to do with love?

622
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:37,590
I would love that conquers me.
I've waited so long.

623
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:41,790
Wow.

624
00:51:41,950 --> 00:51:46,550
I have never
told this to anyone before.

625
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:51,750
It feels so ... nice.

626
00:51:57,190 --> 00:52:01,990
You know, Ronal? It is actually
nice talking to you.

627
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:05,590
You are also lovely.

628
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:08,950
- Uh, talk to, I think.
- Well.

629
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:14,150
And if I had meant it in the
otherwise, would we have beaten.

630
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:19,510
- No, it would not be so fortunate.
- It would be a little strange.

631
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:23,310
(Animal roar)

632
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:25,870
- What was it?
- I do not know.

633
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:29,270
Hey, Elric.
(Snoring)

634
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:33,910
Elves do not sleep.

635
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:39,630
- What is it that says the sound?
- I sense a common voice.

636
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:44,390
(Cries)

637
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:48,390
No one escapes
Prince Volcazars anger!

638
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:50,430
Ronal, beware!

639
00:52:52,590 --> 00:52:54,150
Zandra!

640
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:03,030
- Curse!
- Ronal, wait for me!

641
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:15,990
Ronal!

642
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:18,070
Oh, fuck!

643
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:27,390
(Evil laughter)

644
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:36,310
Satan!

645
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:42,230
They are gone.

646
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:45,150
No! Move!

647
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:48,830
Zandra!

648
00:53:51,110 --> 00:53:53,870
- No, no, no.
- We find her.

649
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:57,470
If we go now
so we collect them. Come.

650
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:03,670
- What did you do?
- I do not know.

651
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:10,350
The Amazons.

652
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:24,990
(Giggles, laughter and chitchat)

653
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:32,230
- It's stuck.
- Congratulations, honey.

654
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:36,670
... simply so much sun.

655
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:40,110
See my new shoes.
Are not they amazing?

656
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:43,630
- It's only women.
- I died and gone to heaven.

657
00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:49,670
- Hi, girls. What is happening?
- What is that?

658
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:54,350
- Oh, totally botched stomach pouch.
- Hello. Good to see you.

659
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:06,870
High Queen, we have captured
these women in the jungle.

660
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:11,230
We have taken them with them,
so they can decide their fate.

661
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:14,150
Stand them up. Let me see them.

662
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:31,550
Maximum remarkable women.
I've never seen anything like it.

663
00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:34,350
- What is it?
- Ow!

664
00:55:34,510 --> 00:55:38,390
- One even has hair on his chin.
- How clumsy!

665
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:42,190
- High Queen.
- Ten, shoddy girl.

666
00:55:42,350 --> 00:55:46,270
- Who has asked you to speak?
- We are not women.

667
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:50,990
- Well, we are such men then, no?
- Men?

668
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:54,550
- Or so nearly so.
- Men?

669
00:55:57,630 --> 00:56:04,070
Heaven be praised. The gods have heard
our prayers and sent us two men.

670
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:10,470
Finally the time has arrived
where we can pursue our tribe.

671
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:13,910
Before them the sacred mating cabins.

672
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:17,110
- What?
- What!

673
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:21,910
(Cry of joy)

674
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:28,230
We take the thin first.
Him here we save for tomorrow.

675
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:31,070
No, help.
No, I will not!

676
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:37,190
Honestly, man. It can not be l
you know. I will also be paired with.

677
00:56:37,350 --> 00:56:40,270
It's fucking typical it here.

678
00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:43,750
No!

679
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:54,110
- Lord.
- What's new?

680
00:56:54,270 --> 00:56:58,550
We have caught the warrior who has
barbarian helped to escape.

681
00:57:11,910 --> 00:57:13,950
Looking at it.

682
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:18,190
A skjoldmø.

683
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:24,230
- And a very pretty one.
- Give me a gun and let me fight.

684
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:27,030
Each thing in its time.

685
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:29,070
(Sniff)

686
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:32,190
No one put a hand on me with impunity.

687
00:57:32,350 --> 00:57:34,910
So die then!

688
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:53,470
(War roar)

689
00:58:16,550 --> 00:58:21,390
Impressive.
You are a woman of my choice.

690
00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:25,270
Sad that I will have to
to kill you!

691
00:58:43,230 --> 00:58:44,990
What?

692
00:58:51,150 --> 00:58:53,950
Foolish woman.

693
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:16,990
I know your rules skjoldmø.
You must obey me now.

694
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:21,230
It is your destiny.

695
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:23,990
You have defeated me.

696
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:26,750
(Evil laughter)

697
00:59:28,590 --> 00:59:31,790
Bunkering piercing is too fat.

698
00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:34,070
Double piercing is the shit.

699
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:40,710
(Door opens)

700
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:43,310
(Whining)

701
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:47,270
Yes! It was damn time.
Is it my turn?

702
00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:50,390
The ceremony is over.
You will be used tomorrow.

703
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:53,590
- What? Tomorrow?
- The queen's order.

704
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:57,790
Come back!
I will also be abused!

705
00:59:59,310 --> 01:00:02,030
- Did you lock?
- Of course.

706
01:00:02,190 --> 01:00:04,590
(Winces)

707
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:06,990
Hey, what are you doing?

708
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:12,430
- We must leave.
- What about all the Amazons?

709
01:00:12,590 --> 01:00:16,110
Zandra is in danger. We must find
Wreath sword and help her.

710
01:00:16,270 --> 01:00:19,670
- Can he wait a week.
- We can not leave her behind.

711
01:00:19,830 --> 01:00:23,390
- Can not we find another warrior?
- I want Zandra!

712
01:00:23,550 --> 01:00:27,710
Hello, you would not
have her help to start with.

713
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:32,430
Fuck you! I will be here
and having hot love with hot babes.

714
01:00:32,590 --> 01:00:35,910
It's the only reason
I was taken with the expedition.

715
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:41,030
Oh, I forgot. You're not
on expeditions. You're just fucking boring.

716
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:44,510
Fine. Stay here.

717
01:00:46,070 --> 01:00:49,350
You are not
to help a damn thing anyway.

718
01:00:52,350 --> 01:00:55,470
(Hums congarytme)

719
01:00:59,670 --> 01:01:02,670
Oh, I just love the song.

720
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:07,150
(Votes)
(String pops)

721
01:01:07,310 --> 01:01:10,830
Damn! Fucking shit!

722
01:01:22,830 --> 01:01:26,390
Oh, what the fuck I walk in, man?
Ronal, I come.

723
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:28,710
(Stomach growls)

724
01:01:35,790 --> 01:01:40,430
- My queen?
- I just had to see you.

725
01:01:41,150 --> 01:01:46,030
Ever since I saw you the first time
is my body trembled with longing.

726
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:50,270
I know it's against the rules,
But I must have you.

727
01:01:50,430 --> 01:01:54,990
- If I may ...
- I can not control myself. Take me!

728
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:57,630
Take me! Oh! Yes!

729
01:02:03,710 --> 01:02:06,230
Take me!

730
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:08,630
Stop!

731
01:02:08,790 --> 01:02:12,710
Unfortunately I can not, Mrs. Queen.
My friend needs me.

732
01:02:12,910 --> 01:02:13,950
What?

733
01:02:14,110 --> 01:02:17,390
Maybe I can be taken
prisoner again on the return trip.

734
01:02:17,550 --> 01:02:20,070
Alarm!

735
01:02:24,270 --> 01:02:29,270
- Pigs! Some men are pigs!
- Insanity bitches, man!

736
01:02:32,030 --> 01:02:36,150
- L progresses from your responsibility!
- And l pissing on board!

737
01:02:36,310 --> 01:02:39,510
Men just hung from my balls!

738
01:02:53,990 --> 01:02:55,510
Elric?

739
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:58,270
It's all the first barbarians.

740
01:04:06,070 --> 01:04:07,950
Wow.

741
01:04:13,030 --> 01:04:15,270
Hello.

742
01:04:15,430 --> 01:04:20,270
I need your sword.
I'll take good care of it.

743
01:04:26,510 --> 01:04:28,910
It is quite easy. Wow.

744
01:04:34,910 --> 01:04:37,230
(A breath)

745
01:04:37,390 --> 01:04:39,990
Yes. I'm sorry.

746
01:04:47,310 --> 01:04:49,550
Zandra.

747
01:04:49,710 --> 01:04:51,430
I'm sorry.

748
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:56,030
Time after time you escaped
my best riders barbarian.

749
01:04:56,190 --> 01:05:01,230
And then straps you up here, just as
my skjoldmø said you would.

750
01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:08,390
Wreath sword. The only weapon
in the world that can harm you.

751
01:05:08,550 --> 01:05:09,990
Zandra?

752
01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:14,830
Excellent. You have served me well.

753
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:20,590
- As you have commanded me, my lord.
- What the hell is happening?

754
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,910
(Evil laughter)

755
01:05:23,070 --> 01:05:29,110
Move! The barbarians are here
a rendezvous with my mage.

756
01:05:45,710 --> 01:05:49,030
I sense
that Ronal is in great danger.

757
01:05:55,030 --> 01:05:59,510
- Do what you must, sorcerer.
- With pleasure, sir.

758
01:05:59,670 --> 01:06:02,510
- Ronal?
- Gorak?

759
01:06:09,030 --> 01:06:11,670
(Evil laughter)

760
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:16,070
- There you go.
- No, no, no!

761
01:06:21,990 --> 01:06:27,070
Finally! Mighty Zaal,
listen to your humble servant!

762
01:06:27,230 --> 01:06:30,950
Blood from the crown of the sons are gathered.

763
01:06:31,110 --> 01:06:34,750
Grant us access to your temple!

764
01:06:34,910 --> 01:06:38,510
(Evil laughter)
(Exhibition)

765
01:06:42,910 --> 01:06:45,270
What are you doing?

766
01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:50,830
Only once every ten thousand years, it
possible for Zaal, Zakidernes god -

767
01:06:50,990 --> 01:06:57,830
- Get in touch with our world.
I offer the ultimate sacrifice.

768
01:06:57,990 --> 01:07:03,070
The sons of the warrior who sent
him into exile to the hereafter.

769
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:08,830
And as a reward he will give me
His divine power.

770
01:07:08,990 --> 01:07:12,750
All will undergo -

771
01:07:12,910 --> 01:07:15,270
- Or die!

772
01:07:25,950 --> 01:07:30,350
Pis. We can no longer reach
without being detected.

773
01:08:08,830 --> 01:08:10,550
Ronal!

774
01:08:10,710 --> 01:08:14,990
What the hell's wrong with you?
Come on! Lift your feet!

775
01:08:15,150 --> 01:08:17,710
Come on! Up the stairs with you!

776
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:20,590
Wait here.

777
01:08:24,670 --> 01:08:26,910
- Ronal.
- Alibert!

778
01:08:27,070 --> 01:08:30,030
- What?
- Hold up, however.

779
01:08:30,190 --> 01:08:32,510
Going forward, you wretch.

780
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:36,910
Ronal, where have you done
Wreath of swords?

781
01:08:37,070 --> 01:08:42,110
There is nothing to do. It lies
on the altar below. Hurry away.

782
01:08:59,030 --> 01:09:03,070
I am not satisfied,
until they scream like the pigs they are!

783
01:09:07,830 --> 01:09:12,150
Mighty zaal we bestow you
blood from the crown of the sons.

784
01:09:12,310 --> 01:09:15,390
Let your dark bless us.

785
01:09:17,910 --> 01:09:20,710
Soon I am more powerful than a god -

786
01:09:20,910 --> 01:09:24,790
- And thou shalt be my queen
in the immortal life.

787
01:09:37,150 --> 01:09:39,510
Hey! What are you doing here?

788
01:09:40,310 --> 01:09:43,150
- Uh ...
- Kill him.

789
01:09:43,310 --> 01:09:46,950
No, wait. I am master Alibert.

790
01:09:47,110 --> 01:09:49,390
And the bard!

791
01:09:49,550 --> 01:09:54,310
I'm here to play for
your party ... just occult ritual.

792
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:56,910
This one knows l may.

793
01:09:57,910 --> 01:10:01,070
your buff
it makes me crazy

794
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:04,470
on the dance floor
can you see it

795
01:10:04,630 --> 01:10:07,510
your skull charm
it gives me warm

796
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:11,790
little cuddles
sweet treasure

797
01:10:13,470 --> 01:10:16,510
- Shut up, crap.
- Oh!

798
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:19,830
- See you.
- Come back, you little shit!

799
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:26,990
Let The Chosen One step forward!

800
01:10:39,070 --> 01:10:41,630
- Hey, Ronal.
- Wreath sword.

801
01:10:41,790 --> 01:10:44,510
- I make you free.
- We must liberate the others.

802
01:10:44,670 --> 01:10:48,190
- I hurry as well as I can.
- What the hell?

803
01:10:55,190 --> 01:10:58,670
Drop the splice.
You have no chance.

804
01:10:58,830 --> 01:11:01,750
Come on. Give me your best shot.

805
01:11:08,670 --> 01:11:11,190
Beautiful. It was really ...

806
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:20,270
- What the hell?
- Sorry.

807
01:11:20,430 --> 01:11:29,510
What?

808
01:11:36,790 --> 01:11:39,670
It is here I fuckin
looking forward to!

809
01:11:47,190 --> 01:11:49,190
Oh yeah!

810
01:11:56,310 --> 01:11:58,510
- Kill them.
- But ...

811
01:11:58,670 --> 01:12:00,910
- That's an order!
- Zandra!

812
01:12:01,070 --> 01:12:05,790
You belong to me, skjoldmø!
Do not forget it.

813
01:12:05,950 --> 01:12:08,230
Yes, my lord.

814
01:12:16,350 --> 01:12:19,230
- Ronal.
- You do not do it here.

815
01:12:19,390 --> 01:12:23,510
Volcazar has defeated me in a duel.
It is my destiny.

816
01:12:34,630 --> 01:12:37,270
Zandra, that's me.

817
01:12:37,430 --> 01:12:41,350
It's completely ridiculous.
Is this really your destiny -

818
01:12:41,510 --> 01:12:44,390
- To beat the only
who love you to death -

819
01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:48,750
- Simply because some maniac
has beaten you in a fight?

820
01:12:53,630 --> 01:12:55,590
Watch out!

821
01:12:56,270 --> 01:12:58,270
Ronal!

822
01:13:00,230 --> 01:13:01,670
Zandra.

823
01:13:01,830 --> 01:13:03,470
(Roar)

824
01:13:10,350 --> 01:13:12,430
Let me go!

825
01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:22,910
Lord, make haste and bottom
before it is too late.

826
01:13:25,470 --> 01:13:28,630
Clever boy. Down with the needle.

827
01:13:33,070 --> 01:13:35,350
Oh, shit.

828
01:13:39,230 --> 01:13:41,990
Die!

829
01:13:44,830 --> 01:13:46,430
No!

830
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:48,590
(Evil laughter)

831
01:14:10,470 --> 01:14:13,950
The darkness must be aroused in Metalonien.

832
01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:18,910
The sound of screams
must rise to the sky.

833
01:14:19,070 --> 01:14:22,870
All must submit to me -

834
01:14:23,030 --> 01:14:25,630
- Or die!

835
01:14:26,390 --> 01:14:28,430
(Scream)

836
01:14:42,470 --> 01:14:44,590
Fuck!

837
01:14:48,710 --> 01:14:52,630
Lays Wreath! "Crane took his proud sword
and drove with all his force -

838
01:14:52,790 --> 01:14:56,630
- The blade deep in zakidens shell
skull burst. "

839
01:14:56,790 --> 01:15:01,110
You have to hit him up on his forehead.
It is his weak point, man!

840
01:15:03,990 --> 01:15:06,230
It's impossible!

841
01:15:11,950 --> 01:15:15,710
There is nothing you can do here.
Save yourself!

842
01:15:15,910 --> 01:15:19,030
- What?
- It's not a place for you.

843
01:15:19,190 --> 01:15:20,790
Get out!

844
01:15:20,950 --> 01:15:24,910
No. I'm done
running around it.

845
01:15:29,070 --> 01:15:31,910
Now you behave yourself
damn well.

846
01:15:35,550 --> 01:15:38,470
Yes, indeed! Hit him in the forehead!

847
01:15:41,390 --> 01:15:43,910
- In the forehead.
- What do you think I'm trying?

848
01:15:44,070 --> 01:15:47,790
I'll crush you like an insect!

849
01:15:55,710 --> 01:15:57,910
He is fucking killed.

850
01:15:58,070 --> 01:15:59,910
Oh, damn!

851
01:16:03,990 --> 01:16:08,070
May my aim be sharp as a hawk's
and error-free as the great tit.

852
01:16:17,270 --> 01:16:19,750
So stand, be silent!

853
01:16:28,830 --> 01:16:30,630
No!

854
01:16:32,190 --> 01:16:34,150
Now I have you!

855
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:38,190
Eat lute, your bitch!

856
01:17:01,030 --> 01:17:03,390
No, no. No!

857
01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:17,910
- Zandra!
- My queen! Kill the fleas here.

858
01:17:26,190 --> 01:17:31,830
What do you do? Your honor greets you
to serve me!

859
01:17:31,990 --> 01:17:34,430
No! It is finished!

860
01:17:35,710 --> 01:17:38,590
So die then!

861
01:17:47,350 --> 01:17:48,910
Zandra!

862
01:17:49,070 --> 01:17:53,790
Okay, folks, let's show them
how barbarians are really struggling!

863
01:18:00,110 --> 01:18:01,790
Gorak!

864
01:18:06,710 --> 01:18:09,110
- Come on, guys!
- Muscles!

865
01:18:14,030 --> 01:18:17,990
I am invincible!

866
01:18:30,110 --> 01:18:33,270
- What?
- This one's for Uncle Gundars!

867
01:18:33,430 --> 01:18:36,270
(Pain cry)

868
01:18:37,510 --> 01:18:39,190
Uh?

869
01:18:41,630 --> 01:18:43,630
(Evil laughter)

870
01:19:00,910 --> 01:19:04,790
Holy shit.
My g-string sits right up the ass.

871
01:19:05,910 --> 01:19:07,790
Ronal?

872
01:19:13,110 --> 01:19:14,590
Ronal!

873
01:19:19,110 --> 01:19:20,910
Oh no.

874
01:19:34,670 --> 01:19:38,910
There are Ronal.
The greatest barbarians of us all.

875
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:57,550
(Gasps and coughs)

876
01:20:01,790 --> 01:20:05,750
- What happens?
- He lives damn, man!

877
01:20:08,910 --> 01:20:11,990
I feel great love.

878
01:20:12,790 --> 01:20:14,630
It's so beautiful.

879
01:20:18,430 --> 01:20:21,710
Now I have not challenged you
to a duel, right?

880
01:20:21,910 --> 01:20:23,350
You ...

881
01:20:23,510 --> 01:20:27,390
You have already
conquered my heart, Ronal.

882
01:20:30,150 --> 01:20:32,110
Then it becomes cheesy.

883
01:20:32,270 --> 01:20:36,110
It's time for beer and beer,
beer and beer.

884
01:20:36,270 --> 01:20:39,230
Beer and beer, beer and beer.

885
01:20:43,230 --> 01:20:45,150
(Vomiting sounds)

886
01:20:45,910 --> 01:20:47,950
Should l just see something sick?

887
01:20:48,110 --> 01:20:49,910
Wow!

888
01:20:51,910 --> 01:20:53,590
Øj.

889
01:20:53,750 --> 01:20:58,150
- Oh, that's good.
- I sense a strong muscular rheumatism.

890
01:20:58,310 --> 01:21:01,510
I have also been tightened up
on a leather cross an entire week.

891
01:21:01,670 --> 01:21:05,590
Keep just shut up, man.
I want to say something important.

892
01:21:07,190 --> 01:21:10,750
For Ronal,
the thirsty barbarians in the world.

893
01:21:12,150 --> 01:21:14,070
Cheers!

894
01:21:14,230 --> 01:21:18,910
- How the hell are you drinking?
- Fucking barbarians, man.
