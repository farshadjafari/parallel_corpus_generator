1
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,637
10:53 p.m.

2
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,636
Sorry for scaring you.
I was just heading home.

3
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,196
- We met before in the can.
- Oh, you're Wyatt, right?

4
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,193
Yeah. So, you working late or
you downloading a multitude of porn.

5
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,796
I have to be out of here by tomorrow
so I'm just trying to finish up.

6
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,474
- What about you?
- You kidding? This is an early night.

7
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,596
Hard to believe once upon a time...

8
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,070
it was a measure of a man's success
on how little he worked.

9
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,469
What's the deal? Our firm hires you
to bless our books they send you?

10
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,757
I'm the audit manager, yeah. I handle
the same 7 or 8 clients every year.

11
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,798
I must've done Stern
for something like 4 years now.

12
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,793
- Wow. So you like this work?
- I do. The order of it appeals to me.

13
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,800
The symmetry.

14
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,838
It's alright, I guess,
if you like workin' with numbers.

15
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,831
Do you like being a lawyer?

16
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,310
It's alright, I guess,
if you like workin' with assholes.

17
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,274
- I'm probably disturbing you, so...
- Hey, no, it's alright. I'm almost done.

18
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,920
- Really.
- Oh.

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,592
So...

20
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,432
Worth and Berman, huh?
Did they headhunt you?

21
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,269
Yeah. My senior year of college.
They subsidized my graduate degree.

22
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,352
Ah, I see.
So you were poor, right?

23
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,517
I guess I was kind of poor.
I was brought up by my mom on her own...

24
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,990
and she died when I was 19
so it was kind of like a lifeline.

25
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,317
- Wow. Sounds like you needed it.
- I'm sure there's a lot of people

26
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,391
- that had it worse.
- Not here.

27
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,552
Practically every suit I know
is Harvard by way of Andover.

28
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,471
- Are you?
- Oh, hell no. No, no.

29
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,997
- I'm Princeton by way of Exeter.
- But that's like the same. Oh yeah.

30
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,834
So, Jonathan...

31
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,830
I think I have something here
which might help you to focus.

32
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,715
- You smoke?
- Not for a long time.

33
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,872
Good. This'll give you a real buzz,
then.

34
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,795
I don't know...
I just sometimes feel so, uh...

35
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,432
you know... removed.

36
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,472
I work for one of the biggest
accounting firms in the world...

37
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,950
and there's not so much as a desk there
to prove it. My new senior manager...

38
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,474
I haven't even met him in person yet.

39
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,950
I try and meet people at work
but it's always the same.

40
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,592
To the accounting staff I'm a pain because
for 2 weeks they must hold their breath.

41
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,478
They hope I don't pick up
any of their screw-ups.

42
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,950
To everyone else I'm just a temporary fixed
so I bother them.

43
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,874
Sometimes...

44
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,794
I sit and I look through the glass,
and I see life..

45
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,432
- literally passing me by.
- Jonathan.

46
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,432
Yeah?

47
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,715
By the clock on that wall you have been
talking for 37 minutes straight.

48
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,112
I don't remember a word I said.

49
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,878
So, God says to Jesus...

50
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,910
I haven't felt this good
since I saw Van Halen in '97.

51
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,671
Stand clear of the closing doors, please.

52
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,433
- Is this the train to Canal Street?
- Yes, this is the right train.

53
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,790
So, I guess that's it.
This is my report for Mr. Cross.

54
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,871
Could you point me towards
Wyatt Bose's office, please?

55
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,996
- Who?
- Wyatt Bose. He's one of your...

56
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,958
Hey, quit looking down Daphne's shirt.

57
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,110
So, get in, get out, huh? So where's next?

58
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,272
Clancey Funds on Friday
and then Clute-Nichols after that.

59
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,238
Sounds like fun.
Wait up a sec.

60
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,679
- Good to meet you, Jonathan.
- You, too.

61
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,832
So... wait.
You have the day off tomorrow?

62
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,072
How's your backhand?

63
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,793
- I'm sorry.
- Good game.

64
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,472
Commiserations, McQuarry.

65
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,235
You develop a killer instinct,
you'll beat the crap out of me.

66
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,675
When these things first came out,
I think I was a frosh at boarding school.

67
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,433
Geez, where did you get this thing?
You steal it from Jimmy Connors?

68
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,910
- What is this? Natural gut, hm?
- No, natural gut and Kevlar.

69
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,672
I should have 'em replaced.
They're pretty frayed.

70
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,712
Those two girls were so pretty.

71
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,318
You don't get much, do you?

72
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,148
- Do you mean sex?
- No, flood insurance.

73
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,834
How many women have you slept with?

74
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,798
Of course you know. Everyone knows.

75
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,758
- Maybe four.
- Maybe four?

76
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,074
Alright. Four. What about you?

77
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,550
- Me? I have no idea.
- You just said everyone knows.

78
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,116
I meant everyone like you.
C'mon, hurry up. Let's go for a drink.

79
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,152
You can borrow something of mine.
Ah. Guten Abend, Herr Kleiner.

80
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,153
This way, Jonathan.

81
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,877
Like it?

82
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,959
It's a Gerhard Richter. Actually,
Kleiner, the guy we just saw downstairs.

83
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,076
He's a hotshot art dealer.

84
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,913
He hooked me up with this
fantastic gallery in Munich.

85
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,991
I'll be back in a second.

86
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,954
Try this one.

87
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,269
What?

88
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,916
C'mon, Jonathan.

89
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,993
You remind me of this guy, Jamie Getz.
I met him my freshman year at Princeton.

90
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,995
Oh, he was real smart. He was witty, too,
when you loosened him up. But he had...

91
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,470
It was bounday. Now you assume
that it was never scaled out.

92
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,396
The truth is he was the only one guarding.

93
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,872
- What happened to him?
- Oh, he killed himself.

94
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,109
What?

95
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,352
You're kidding.

96
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,956
- Go get changed.
- Down here?

97
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,913
Down there.
Second door on the right.

98
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,990
Okay, Jonathan, so just the four, huh?

99
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,674
Oh, come on.
Now, look...

100
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,197
I've never been too adventuresome.

101
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,432
-What's the lamest?
- Well, I once...

102
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,354
- No, c'mon, share it with the group.
- I once phoned one of those sex lines.

103
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,557
- Alright, now we’re talking.
- I talked to girl named Star.

104
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:27,589
I ended up explaining a Section 179
deduction on the new Escalade.

105
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,395
- You paid to give tax advice on a sex line?
- That's about the size of it.

106
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,230
Oh, thank you for sharing, Jonathan.
That is pretty lame.

107
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,278
Oh, hello.

108
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,956
- Do you... is she looking at me?
- Yeah, she's looking at you.

109
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,112
- No, she's not. C'mon.
- Maybe it's the suit?

110
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,872
Listen, you don't think
women have the same urges?

111
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:59,350
Successful women working their asses off
to stay that way?

112
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,475
And?

113
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,473
Well, let's just say there's a way
that it can be taken care of.

114
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,751
You make it sound like a mob hit.

115
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,953
- Had a good time tonight?
- I had a really good time tonight.

116
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,953
- I did. I had a great time.
- Whoa. I wasn't sure at one point.

117
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,235
No, I'm shy. But...

118
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,357
Thank you. And thanks for the tennis
and for takin' me out.

119
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,353
It's okay. Tennis anytime.
Particularly if you play that badly.

120
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,394
At the corner, please.
The Waldorf Astoria.

121
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,995
I gotta go meet somebody.

122
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,072
- Take care. Have a nice night.
- I'll call you tomorrow.

123
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,039
Any problems,
you'll want to see Julie Levinson.

124
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,111
She's our Assistant Controller.

125
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,196
But, like I said,
I don't anticipate any problems.

126
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,997
- Never had any before.
- Okay. Thanks.

127
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,711
It's really nice out here.
I usually just brown bag it.

128
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,509
You have to get outside. Those fluorescent
lights will kill you. I read about them.

129
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,109
Hello.

130
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,512
Shit. No, I got it here. Hold on.

131
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:51,035
See if you can change it to the 6:30
out of JFK flight #4. Right. Yeah.

132
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,391
Rutherford wants me to join him
in London ASAP.

133
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,790
- We're papering some finance with Lloyds.
I tell you about this? - No.

134
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,236
- I'll be gone a couple weeks.
- Sounds sort of interesting.

135
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,312
Gonna be as boring as sin, but...
Anyhow, I gotta get back.

136
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,879
- Ready?
- Alright.

137
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,233
That's disgusting.
I don't want to hear that.

138
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,719
Why?

139
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,190
That's repulsive.
Don't ever tell anyone that. Ever.

140
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,750
You're the kind of girl that pees
in front of men, aren't you?

141
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,230
What goes in the Xerox Room
stays in the Xerox room.

142
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,472
Jonathan McQuarry, hello.

143
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,319
Hello?

144
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:48,076
Wyatt? I've got your cell phone. I guess,
you've got mine. What a pain in the ass.

145
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,594
You're probably in the air right, so,
if you get this, call me on your phone.

146
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,590
I'll speak to you later. Take care.

147
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,749
- Mr. Lewman. Hi.
- Hello.

148
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,515
Actually, Mr. Lewman, there was something
I wanted to talk to you about. Excuse me.

149
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,029
- Hello?
- Are you free tonight?

150
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,715
Look, this isn't actually...
Sorry, could you just hold on a sec?

151
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,076
Mr. Lewman, my bedroom...
I think I have a leak.

152
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,229
I was hoping you could take a look.
McQuarry. 631.

153
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,990
Right. McQuarry. Yeah,
I'll get to it soon as I can.

154
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,793
Hello? Anyone there?

155
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,078
- Hello?
- Are you free tonight?

156
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,073
- Actually, I am, but this isn't Wyatt.
- Sorry, I didn't get that.

157
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,191
- Well, I am free, but...
- Could you be at The Dylan in one hour?

158
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,271
I guess so, but...

159
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,593
- Are you waiting for me?
- Yes, I think so.

160
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,558
- Would you like a drink or something?
- No, thanks.

161
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,030
I've got a conference call
with Tokyo early in the morning.

162
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,036
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

163
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,992
- Have you been in this hotel before?
- No.

164
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,714
Look, the person who you thought
you were talking to isn't me.

165
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,956
- You're not who I spoke to on the phone?
- No, no... Yes, yes, I am.

166
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,358
- But...
- What's wrong?

167
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,870
- Are you not attracted to me?
- Oh, you're beautiful.

168
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,590
It's just you called me
and I came here but I don't...

169
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,752
- You don't?
- I'm not too sure what's going on.

170
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,471
You're not too sure what's going on?

171
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,395
Sit down. Sit down.

172
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,150
- Hello.
- Hey, you're up early.

173
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,630
- Hey! How's London?
- Rainy. So you got mine, I got yours.

174
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,713
Yeah, I must've grabbed it at lunch
before you left.

175
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,349
- No big deal. I already had my work calls
forwarded here. - Oh, alright.

176
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,432
- So, did I get any calls?
- Yes, you did.

177
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,195
- And?
- Well...

178
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,917
- What the hell was that?
- I knew it. You met up with someone.

179
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,515
- I thought you would call me back.
- Oh, spare me. I woulda done the same.

180
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,910
- So how was it?
- It was really amazing, actually. She...

181
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,118
Shit. I'll call you later. The want me
in a meeting. I wand to hear all about it.

182
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,512
- Alright.
- As for my phone, feel free to use it.

183
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,991
Okay. Thanks.

184
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,359
Yes?

185
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,433
Hello. Uh...

186
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,511
- Yes?
- Are you free tonight?

187
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,638
- Where?
- Where, right.

188
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,598
- The Dylan Hotel.
- Perhaps The Park Avenue.

189
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,671
In the bar, half past eleven.

190
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,076
If you are who you don't seem to be,
you're late.

191
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,994
- Excuse me?
- Are you?

192
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,032
Late, or who I'm not supposed to be?

193
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,834
Either.

194
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,636
Yes, I am late,
and I am who I don't seem to be.

195
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,434
Alright, then.

196
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,630
- Could you put this on the room, please?
- Yes, ma'am.

197
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,314
I don't have a room.

198
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,832
You're rather new to this, aren't you?

199
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,872
The initiator is responsible for the room.
That's one of the rules.

200
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,838
- Oh. So I should...
- Precisely.

201
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,912
Oh. Excuse me.

202
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,156
Frankly, I'm surprised whoever
sponsored you didn't explain more.

203
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,630
Downstairs, you talked about a rule.
Are there others?

204
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,310
No rough stuff. If that's your thing,
take it elsewhere.

205
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,749
- No business talk, and no names.
- Right.

206
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,034
- How did you get into this?
- A friend of mine...

207
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,396
He introduced you to the list
but failed to explain the basics?

208
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,677
Well, he had to leave town.
I'm doing something wrong here, aren't I?

209
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,036
It's not that. You just strike me
as something of a stowaway.

210
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,715
If it wasn't for the $4,000 suit,
I'd say you didn't belong here at all.

211
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,279
This is us.

212
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,319
Although,
someone obviously thought you did.

213
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,470
And I'm a sucker for bashful boys.

214
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,991
Can I ask you something?

215
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,030
- Why do you do this?
- For the same reason that men do it.

216
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,511
The economics of the arrangement.

217
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,349
Intimacy without intricacy.

218
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,911
I work past midnight almost every night.

219
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,077
The last dinner I had that wasn't business
was about a year ago.

220
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,270
Hey, Wyatt, it's Jonathan.
I haven't heard from you, but...

221
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,759
I guess
you must be pretty swamped over there.

222
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,593
Look, I just wanted to say thank you.

223
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,918
Wait. Wait. Before we...

224
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,270
The thing is, I know you.
I mean, not "know you" exactly.

225
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,758
We met before in the Times Square
subway station. It had been raining,

226
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,230
and you asked me if the train stops
at Canal Street.

227
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,309
No.

228
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,235
Wait. It just feels a little strange,
that's all.

229
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,392
Why? Because you've seen me before?

230
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,189
- Maybe. It's just...
- C'mon, what's the problem?

231
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,395
Okay...

232
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,196
I guess it is a little bit
of a gear shift.

233
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,991
Maybe some other time.

234
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,072
Oh, no, please. What I mean is...

235
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,916
By any chance... are you hungry?

236
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:40,353
Mm, you have a little bit of...
of ketchup on your chin.

237
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,313
- Oh. I'm sorry. I'm a messy eater.
- No, it's okay. So am I. Here.

238
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,471
- There you go.
- Thank you.

239
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:54,435
- You have a little piece of...
- Oh, what, onion in my hair?

240
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,158
So what do you do for a living?

241
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:08,036
I sit behind glass
and I watch people pass like fish.

242
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,112
- You work in a bank?
- I'm sort of an accountant.

243
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:14,392
I bet that's what you always
dreamed of being when you grew up.

244
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,040
Oh, yeah, I'm livin' the dream.
Feel free to leave now.

245
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,559
Still here.

246
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,319
- But how about you?
- No.

247
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,676
No, no, no, I'm afraid that we're
still on you.

248
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,237
- Frank.
- Frank?

249
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,318
You look like a Frank.

250
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,592
- By the way, my name is...
- Oh, sh.

251
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,076
You know the rules. No names.

252
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,152
Yeah, but the rules seem to specify
no conversation either.

253
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,794
Okay. How 'bout I tell you my name,
if you guess.

254
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,716
Oh, you're in real trouble here.
You see, I am very good at this.

255
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,190
- What are you very good at?
- Problem solving. It's what I do.

256
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:03,678
I'm very good at identifying hierarchical
relationships and binary posits.

257
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,797
- Is that right?
- Absolutely.

258
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,678
And this talent can be applied
to finding anything.

259
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,399
For example,
I know that your name begins with an S.

260
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,710
- How do you know that?
- I saw your key chain on your purse.

261
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,190
- Wow. Excellent work.
- Thank you. So, the things we know are

262
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,796
A, your name begins with an S.
B, you have a white coat.

263
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,359
And C...

264
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,352
And C, you do not know
your way around the subway.

265
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,989
That's true.

266
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:35,073
Now all I do is extrapolate from
these known qualities and your name...

267
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,349
is...

268
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,514
Sybil.

269
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:45,589
- Sophie. You're definitely a Sophie.
- Wait, with an "ie" or a "y"?

270
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,318
- Either.
- Neither.

271
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,638
- How about Syd, as in Syd Charisse?
- No, she was Syd with a C.

272
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,110
- Yeah, but maybe you spell it with an S.
- I do not.

273
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,832
- Sexy Steffi was lookin' for a train...
- No.

274
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,192
- Sunbeam.
- Oh, God, do I look like a Sunbeam?

275
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,799
Absolutely.

276
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,479
Well, then, that's it.

277
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:12,469
- I told you I was good at this.
- I'm very impressed.

278
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,154
I'm crashing.

279
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,796
I'd really like to see you again.
Not in a hotel.

280
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,553
Hm, well... we'll see about that.

281
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,395
- Maybe tomorrow?
- It is tomorrow.

282
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,471
- Hello?
- Are you free tonight?

283
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,950
- Hey, are you back?
- I wish. It's friggin' anarchy here.

284
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,036
Hang on. Hello?

285
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,112
- Housekeeping.
- Uh, could you come back? Thanks.

286
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,997
- Sorry.
- Where are you?

287
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,753
- I'm in the Soho Grand.
- Soho Grand, huh?

288
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,753
- Sounds like you've been enjoying yourself.
- I have. I met this girl last night,

289
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,150
and I broke all the rules and I had
an honest-to-God conversation with her.

290
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,630
- That's extremely naughty of you.
- Who is she, Romeo?

291
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,509
I have no idea, really. I don't know
very much about her yet, but...

292
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,229
- I'm gonna see her again.
- I don't want to dampen your spirits...

293
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:14,312
- What?
- You met her through the list.

294
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,911
She's different. Trust me.

295
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,670
- So when are you back?
- Hard to say.

296
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,991
It's back-to-back bullshit here.
But next week, I hope.

297
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,356
Well, good luck.
I'll see you when you get back.

298
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,119
You, too.

299
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,634
- Hello?
- Are you free tonight?

300
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,711
I'm sorry, you have the wrong number.

301
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,872
- Hello?
- Hey, are you free tonight?

302
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,633
Can you meet me in Chinatown,
on Doyer Street? Say, eight o'clock?

303
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,949
Okay.

304
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,831
I got you a present.

305
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,358
- Thank you.
- It looks great on you.

306
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,119
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

307
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,833
We'd like... we'd like one of these.

308
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:08,116
And... one of these...
oh, and that.

309
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,633
Thank you.

310
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,156
- What did you order?
- I have absolutely no idea.

311
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,554
- How do you know we’ll like it?
- How do you know we won't?

312
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,518
This is so not my life.

313
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,509
Ever since that night on the subway
I haven't stopped thinking about you.

314
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,591
I'm not sure I believe you.

315
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,991
I mean, you're in a sex club.
I'm not judging you. I'm in there, too.

316
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,993
But don't say you've been
solemnly holding a torch for me for...

317
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,357
- long now, one month?
- Point taken.

318
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,511
I got you a present.

319
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,318
Oh, he is so cute.

320
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,193
Thank you.

321
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,158
- Here.
- Thanks.

322
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,952
What is that?

323
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,759
Ginseng gum.

324
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,593
It's terrible.

325
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,113
I guess
it does sort of taste like hairspray.

326
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:48,275
I think I got it now.
I think your name is Suki.

327
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,911
What? What are you thinking about?

328
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,594
- I don't want to complicate your life.
- No...

329
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,070
I want all the complications you've got.

330
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,351
Maybe you should go?

331
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,752
Maybe you should stay.

332
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,991
I know we decided not to rush, but...

333
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:29,150
Just for the record, I'm doing everything
I can just to apply the brakes here.

334
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,033
Oh, me too.

335
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,708
Our parents would be proud.

336
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,639
But just say...

337
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,799
Say what?

338
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,793
If we acted...

339
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,998
just suddenly tore off the rest of these
clothes to consummate their deep...

340
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,071
human needs in a frenzy of...

341
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,998
Fucking and sucking.

342
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,833
Beautifully put.

343
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,311
- You were saying?
- Well...

344
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,510
- Who could blame these two people?
- Who could possibly judge them?

345
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,633
Who would know?

346
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,478
- I got it.
- Where are you going?

347
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,989
Ice.

348
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,111
Oh, you gonna get some ice, huh?

349
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,832
There's a machine out in the hallway.
I'll be right back.

350
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:40,070
I'll get the ice.
You stay here, I'll get the ice.

351
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,274
- Jonathan. Wait.
- No, I'll go.

352
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,551
Would you like some help?

353
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,399
I can manage. Thank you.

354
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,991
I can't get the card to work.

355
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,149
Hello?

356
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,989
Hello?

357
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:11,989
Hello!

358
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,069
Hello?

359
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,953
Sir. Sir!

360
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,669
Mr. McQuarry, Detective Russo.

361
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:44,152
- How're you doing?
- Not too good.

362
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,432
This is Detective Burke.
I need a background check.

363
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,988
Last name McQuarry, first name Jonathan.

364
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,514
And you don't know anything about her?

365
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:57,513
- Where she works, where she lives,
her phone number? - Like I said,

366
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:01,237
all I know about her
is her first name starts with an S.

367
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,311
- Is she a prostitute?
- No.

368
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:09,032
- I told you, she's a friend.
- A friend you met in a sex group.

369
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:16,635
- Look, who else is in this sex group?
- I don't know. It's not like that.

370
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,199
It's anonymous.

371
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,550
You walked into the room and saw blood?

372
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,428
Yeah, I saw blood and then someone hit me,
and when I came to she was gone.

373
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:27,557
- And you didn't see who hit you?
- No, they were behind me.

374
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,712
- They must've been hiding in the bathroom.
- Well, was there anything stolen?

375
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,190
- Your wallet, or jewelry or anything?
- No, I have my wallet.

376
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:37,397
Look, Detective, please,
you've got to find her.

377
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:40,631
We can't do anything
until I understand what happened tonight.

378
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,711
I told you what happened tonight.

379
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:51,112
Have you ever had
experiences like this before?

380
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,351
- No. What're you talking about?
- We spoke to the desk clerk,

381
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,431
and he only recalls seeing you check in.

382
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:02,478
And as for the blood you say you saw,
we checked the room and found nothing.

383
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,552
In fact, the only blood we found
is where you hit your head.

384
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,388
Look, I know it all sounds...

385
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,230
But I swear there's a woman
in serious trouble right now.

386
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,311
A woman whose name you don't know.

387
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,789
Yes.

388
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,714
- Look, clearly, you had a tough night.
- I'm not crazy.

389
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:33,677
I tell you what. Go home, and if you
remember anything, you give me a call.

390
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,910
Hey, Wyatt, it's me, Jonathan.

391
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:00,038
Look, something happened to me last night.

392
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:03,032
Could you call me back
when you get a chance?

393
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:05,111
I really need to speak to you.

394
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,872
- Can I help you?
- I need to speak to Wyatt Bose.

395
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,997
He's one of your attorneys
and in your London office right now.

396
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:16,834
Maybe I can speak to his assistant.
I need to get in touch with him.

397
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,319
Of course. Just a minute.

398
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,198
- Are you sure that you have the right firm?
- Yes, I met him here when I was working.

399
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,556
Wyatt Bose, he's six-one,
he has black hair. Wait.

400
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:32,349
I have his... I have his card.
You see? Look. Wyatt Bose.

401
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,037
I can assure you there is no one
by this name working in this firm.

402
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:40,669
No, but I've seen him in these halls.
We smoked pot in the conference room.

403
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,159
Excuse me?

404
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:47,512
Wait! Hey, wait
I'm trying to get hold of Wyatt.

405
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:50,034
- Who?
- Wyatt Bose. I saw you talking with him.

406
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:53,635
- You cracked jokes with him in the lobby.
- I crack jokes with a lot of people.

407
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:57,315
- Are you trying to tell me you don't...
- Hey! Easy with the hands. What is this?

408
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:01,632
He said he was going to London
with a Mr. Rutherford to paper a deal.

409
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:05,759
Mr. McQuarry, Mr. Rutherford
is presently recovering from hip surgery.

410
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,712
In New Jersey.

411
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,912
- Yes?
- I'm sorry. I'm looking for Wyatt.

412
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:25,316
- Excuse me. Wyatt?
- Yeah, Wyatt Bose. He lives here.

413
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,790
Uh, in, in this building?
No, I'm sorry, he must be new.

414
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,793
No, not in this building.
In this apartment.

415
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:35,793
- No, wait, that painting.
It's a Gerhard Richter, right? - Yes.

416
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:39,112
From the gallery in Munich
that Herr Kleiner handled.

417
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,350
The art dealer downstairs.

418
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,830
Downstairs you must mean Mr. Moretti.
But he's in the carpet business.

419
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,311
Young man, are you alright?

420
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,831
She's a looker.
You weren't kidding.

421
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,392
I can see
why she had you all hot and bothered.

422
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,356
Oh, Jesus Christ, it was you.
Where is she?

423
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:13,989
Wyatt...

424
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,555
I need you to listen. You're starting
next week at Clute-Nichols, yes?

425
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,914
Who are you?

426
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,389
I'm your only shot
at seeing her alive again.

427
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,472
- I asked you a fucking question.
- Yes.

428
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,716
Have a seat. Sit down.

429
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:37,711
As a part of their audit you've temporary
access to all accounts and wire protocols.

430
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,748
- That's what this is about?
- Jonathan.

431
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:44,833
I want you to locate some accounts for me.
You're gonna move some money around.

432
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,916
- I can't.
- What?

433
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,390
- They're client accounts. There's safety...
- Listen!

434
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:55,918
I never said client accounts.
I mean some sub-accounts that I know of,

435
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,913
outside the realm of your audit.
Masked accounts. Slush funds.

436
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:02,998
Typical insider stuff, you know.
20 mil or so,

437
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,719
skimmed into a quiet account
for a rainy day.

438
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,917
- You don't think they'll notice
when it's gone? - Eventually, yes.

439
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,072
But they won't do shit about 'em
'cause it's dirty money.

440
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:15,232
- I can't.
- This isn't a negotiation, Jonathan.

441
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:19,032
Besides, we're friends, remember?

442
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:28,756
I'm warning you. Don't try and be a hero,
'cause people are gonna get hurt.

443
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:33,118
And you go to the cops, I'll make it look
like you cut her pretty little head off.

444
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:37,838
- Don't hurt her.
- Just do as you're instructed,

445
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,554
- and you'll have her back in no time.
- And why should I trust you?

446
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,870
- Everything you told me was a lie.
- Oh, not lies, Jonathan.

447
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:51,910
That was foreplay.
And now you’re fucked.

448
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,719
I'll be watching.

449
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:27,189
Hello?

450
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:38,073
You have one new voice message.

451
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,510
New message one.

452
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:46,072
Are you free tonight? It's me, Tina.
I'm in town. I want to see you again.

453
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:50,399
6 months is way too long.
I'm at The Rhiga, Room 802.

454
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,998
You better show. You owe me.
After all, I was your first.

455
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:22,550
Hello. This is the front desk.
Your guest has arrived.

456
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,198
- You can go on up.
- Thank you.

457
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:52,398
- Who are you? What are you doing here?
- I believe I was invited.

458
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:56,631
- You have the wrong room.
- You didn't leave me a message,

459
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,711
asking if I was free tonight?

460
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:04,108
I must've dialed the wrong number.

461
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,392
Look, I meant to call someone else.
I'm sorry.

462
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,676
I need to speak with you about Wyatt.

463
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,870
I just need to ask you a few questions,
okay?

464
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:20,793
- I'm sorry, I don't know any Wyatt.
- Bullshit. You left him a message,

465
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,872
- asking him to meet you here.
- I thought you said...

466
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,631
Who are you? How did you...

467
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,595
What? No! I just need a few answers.

468
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,198
My name is Jonathan McQuarry.
I know you have no reason to help me,

469
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:39,317
or even to believe me,
but I need to know about Wyatt.

470
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:44,030
- I told you, I don't know any Wyatt.
- That's the name of the guy you called.

471
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,309
No, it isn't.

472
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,513
I'm sorry.

473
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,713
I'm really sorry.

474
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:13,189
I'm really in trouble,
and this guy, he's...

475
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,552
he's dangerous.

476
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:23,998
It was in Chicago about a year ago, at a
private function sponsored by my firm.

477
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:29,357
- He was attending as a guest.
- A guest of who?

478
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:36,318
A guy called Hollaway. Rudolph Holloway.
I think they played tennis together.

479
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:40,871
He told me he'd just moved from Frisco
and was in-between jobs.

480
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:45,478
He was extremely smart.

481
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:50,996
I know it sounds silly, but he had this
way of making me feel close to him.

482
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:55,631
I found myself telling him things.

483
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,838
I told him about this.

484
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,997
You told him about the list.

485
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:05,429
Yes.

486
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:12,958
There was something about him.
Something terrifying.

487
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,631
So why did you call him again?

488
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:26,632
You know when it's so good
you'd rather die than stop?

489
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:33,112
You want to kill someone. You wanna kill
the person you're doing it with.

490
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,435
Fuck it. Y'know what?
He was a good lay.

491
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:54,191
Okay, so what's his real name?

492
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,473
- Jamie.
- Jamie?

493
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,239
That's his name. Jamie Getz.

494
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,599
Jamie Getz.

495
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:17,033
- NYPD Dispatch. How may I direct your call?
- Central Records.

496
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:21,629
Central.

497
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:26,953
This is Detective Russo,
Precinct 22, badge number 15421.

498
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,639
Go ahead, Detective.

499
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:34,637
I need all you got for a missing person.
Last name Getz... G-E-T-Z.

500
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:37,351
First name Jamie.

501
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:41,356
Not gettin' anything.

502
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:47,879
Wait. Got a hit on the
San Francisco database. You near a fax?

503
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:50,399
Yes, uh...

504
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:56,238
Yes, send it to 212-555-0110.

505
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:58,876
- Uh, Russo?
- That's right.

506
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,590
- Send you all we got.
- Thanks.

507
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,789
You have two unheard messages.

508
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:10,077
It's Petersen.
I heard you called in sick today.

509
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:14,312
Just making sure you'll wrap up Clancey
tomorrow. Call me if you need anything.

510
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:19,758
Hi, this is Mr. Lewman, the Super.
I haven't forgotten about your pipe leak.

511
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:24,028
I'll have a look at it Wednesday evening.
I assume you'll still be at work,

512
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:26,270
so I'll let myself in. Thanks.

513
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:28,398
End of messages.

514
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:35,549
Hello?

515
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:38,389
Hello?

516
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:42,396
I'm just making sure you can start
Clute-Nichols on Wednesday.

517
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:45,711
- I want her back.
- Two more days, and she's all yours.

518
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,791
No. I want her back now.

519
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:51,790
- What?
- Yeah, 'cause I know all about you.

520
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:55,071
I know who you are, Jamie Getz.

521
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:59,032
I know all about
your best friend Rudolph Holloway,

522
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:03,159
and where you come from and your days
as a two-bit hustler in San Francisco

523
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:06,550
and 3 years at Avenal
for insurance fraud, arson.

524
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:09,915
How...

525
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,116
Doesn't matter.
What matters is what I know.

526
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:16,473
Now I want her back, unharmed...

527
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:20,796
or else I tell your pathetic story
to the cops. Do you understand?

528
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:23,836
Well-played, Jonathan.

529
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,915
Mr. McQuarry, you have a phone call
from a Detective Russo. Line 4.

530
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:21,876
The body came in a little while ago.
She was found in a taxi.

531
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:26,228
The driver was in a coffee shop, came back
and there she was in the back seat.

532
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:30,908
And she fits the description you gave us
of that missing woman of yours.

533
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:35,997
- And what's her name?
- Simone Wilkenson.

534
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:40,073
Let's go this way.

535
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,711
You want to step in, Mr. McQuarry, please?

536
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:58,389
Okay.

537
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:13,112
Is this the woman you were with
the other night, Mr. McQuarry?

538
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,637
- Mr. McQuarry?
- Yeah.

539
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:24,995
Have you seen this woman before?

540
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:28,191
No, I've never seen her before.

541
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:33,352
- Who is she?
- She's a Wall Street analyst.

542
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:38,678
- And... and what happened to her?
- She was strangled with something.

543
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:41,755
Coulda been wire, even a string.

544
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,952
Lab reports show traces of Kevlar
in the wound.

545
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:49,152
- It's natural gut and Kevlar.
- Kevlar?

546
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:53,356
- Kevlar?
- That should narrow it down for us.

547
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,791
You want to tell me anything else?

548
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:01,869
No.

549
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:29,917
Morning, Einstein.
Ready for your big day?

550
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:33,631
You know fuckin' shit.

551
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:37,432
You think because you know my name
you know me.

552
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:40,951
You have no idea what I'm capable of.

553
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:45,795
Yes, I do. You murdered Simone,
and you constantly try to set me up.

554
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:50,515
Not if you behave.
But if you screw with me today

555
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:54,872
what I did to her is kindness compared to
what I'll do to your little girlfriend.

556
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,392
Why, you won't even recognize her
when I'm through.

557
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:05,313
But her fate's in your hands. If you
don't go through with it, I'll kill her.

558
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:09,238
Yeah. But if I do, you'll kill me.

559
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:11,912
Yeah. It's a bit tricky.

560
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:17,119
But what do you care? You were dead long
before I met you. You just didn't know.

561
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:22,151
You got no killer instinct, Jonathan.

562
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,951
I'll give the instructions to you later.

563
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:31,233
You've got until 6 p.m. to execute them,
or I execute her.

564
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:39,750
Now, remember, be nice to everybody
on your first day at work.

565
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:43,553
First impressions are everything,
don't you agree?

566
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:10,558
- Mr. McQuarry. Follow me, please.
- Hello.

567
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:15,472
All of our C7 logs are on the system.

568
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:05,318
I just saw this in my in-box.
It's for you.

569
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:08,233
I guess it came in a little while ago
by messenger.

570
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,074
Thank you.

571
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,591
Pay attention, Jonathan.
This is what you're gonna do.

572
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:24,070
Look for a group of sub-accounts
in the Liebling-Holloway Trust.

573
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:26,913
These are masked accounts.
48 separate line items

574
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,992
with IBAN numbers ending with 6700.

575
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:32,510
You bundle these phantom accounts

576
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:36,354
and set up a standard wire transfer
to the Banco Nationale, Madrid.

577
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:39,159
An account's already been set up
in your name.

578
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:46,439
Clute-Nichols is very particular about who
accesses their private holding accounts.

579
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:50,873
But you have a level 4 clearance,
and that's why you're my friend, remember?

580
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:59,072
At exactly 5 o'clock, you're gonna log in
and begin a global fund exchange.

581
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,276
Once you're inside, you're gonna
access the Liebling-Holloway Trust

582
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:05,351
through Rudolph Holloway's
private account.

583
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:09,597
You'll only have 40 minutes
to locate the private trust accounts

584
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:12,956
and manually consolidate all balances
into a single fund wire.

585
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:17,276
Once you're done, you'll encode
this fund wire for an end-of-day transfer

586
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:19,351
to the Clute-Nichols office in Hong Kong.

587
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,789
The Asian market
opens 15 hours ahead of us.

588
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:30,236
Thus, this transfer will be catalogued
as Friday's business

589
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:34,279
and won't flag on the Clute transfer log
until end of business Monday.

590
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:36,510
That's 4 days after we're done, Jonathan.

591
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:41,312
That's plenty of time for me
to fill out a withdrawal slip in Spain.

592
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:48,919
Hello, sir.

593
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:03,399
Hey, Russo. Simone Wilkenson spent
the night at The Dylan 2 weeks ago.

594
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:07,310
The guy you like, McQuarry,
paid for the mini-bar in the room.

595
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:09,671
Let's go pick him up.

596
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:08,230
It's not coming out of our pockets, is it?

597
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:10,555
What?

598
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:13,632
- That delivery. You didn't bill it to us.
- No, of course not.

599
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,470
Good.
You guys charge enough as it is.

600
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:25,193
- Is everything okay?
- Okay?

601
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:29,637
- With the audit.
- Yeah, yeah. It's fine.

602
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:33,035
I... it seems to be going very well.

603
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:40,469
Good.

604
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:01,990
It's not exactly a spectator sport.

605
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:09,752
Yeah, well,
I was gonna order in dinner anyway.

606
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:13,550
- You want something?
- No, I'm fine, thank you.

607
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:28,589
Taxi!

608
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:13,033
Come on.

609
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:42,474
- What happened?
- Probably a gas leak.

610
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:47,229
- Which apartment?
- 631. Jonathan McQuarry.

611
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:52,352
- Is there a body?
- Coroner's already taken it away.

612
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:17,157
We should be arriving in Madrid by 6 a.m.

613
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:22,148
Excuse me, are you finished with that?

614
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:25,270
- Please, go ahead.
- Thanks.

615
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,673
- You on business?
- Yes, I am.

616
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:33,672
- What do you do?
- I'm an accountant.

617
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:36,115
- Do you like it?
- I love it.

618
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:39,115
- Numbers know how to behave, right?
- Sure.

619
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:42,552
Order and symmetry.
What else could a man need?

620
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,076
Jim Winter. Deutsche Bank.

621
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:48,152
- Jonathan McQuarry, Worth and Berman.
Nice to meet you. - Likewise.

622
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:37,559
What do you think?

623
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:47,516
- You certainly look the part, Wyatt.
- Whoa, Wyatt?

624
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:50,912
- Who's Wyatt? My name is...
- Hey. Don't.

625
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:53,631
Yeah, the rules. No names, huh?

626
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:57,074
- That's a nice suit.
- When did you get in?

627
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:59,151
- Couple of days ago.
- Two days, huh?

628
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:04,194
- Been enjoying Madrid?
- Been jet-lagged.

629
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:08,190
- We need champagne. You want to order some?
- No, I'm fine with this.

630
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:11,670
Then give me a beer.
Holy shit, look at this.

631
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:16,639
Wow. I spoke to Mr. Ruiz
at Banco Nacional de San Sebastian.

632
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:21,149
He's ready for us whenever we want.
You're about to be a millionaires, baby.

633
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:23,911
How about that? Little ol' you, huh?

634
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:28,115
From the corner of the street and here
you are, to the biggest double suite.

635
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:32,231
Who's always looking out for you?

636
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:36,715
Oh, yeah. Suits and ties,
I told you, they're the big game.

637
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:42,115
Hey. I'm paying you a million bucks
for services rendered.

638
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:46,518
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Nothing. Christ, I'm jet-lagged.

639
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:50,836
I do so hate to be crass, but you
don't have "No, thank you" rights here.

640
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:53,471
You don't have to tell me that twice.

641
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:59,917
So, how did it go?
Everything okay?

642
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,789
Perfect. You did a great job on him.

643
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,992
Yeah, that poor bastard
was practically in love with you.

644
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:13,393
- He said that?
- He didn't need to say it.

645
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:20,117
So, he just transferred the money,
no questions?

646
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:24,512
Sure, he had questions. He said
he would only do it if you were safe.

647
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:27,953
What about him?

648
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:32,990
- Is he safe?
- Well, he had a little accident.

649
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,311
- What?
- The old routine.

650
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:02,710
- You killed him?
- It was an accident.

651
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,677
You fucking killed him?

652
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:08,990
You fucking piece of shit.

653
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:11,435
You fucking lousy... lousy...

654
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:16,592
He knew my name.
Jesus Christ, why do you care?

655
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:20,392
How long do you think he would've waited
for you to show before he called the cops?

656
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,710
One hour? Three? I had no choice.

657
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:25,711
Alright? He would've found me.

658
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:41,199
Jesus Christ.

659
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:44,911
You were into the accountant.

660
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:48,079
You for real?

661
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:56,199
That was stupid.

662
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:01,069
Fuck.

663
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:10,559
I'm sorry.

664
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:14,439
I'm sorry.

665
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:19,234
I don't know what’s wrong with me.

666
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,589
It just caught me by surprise.

667
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:31,632
You'll feel fine later
with all that cash. Trust me.

668
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,551
Buy you a nice leather bag to put it in.

669
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:43,872
We'll take the night train to Paris.
Have some fois gras at Le Bouclard...

670
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:50,197
then mosey on down to Nice.
Work on our tans.

671
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:55,593
Buy a yacht.
We can name it Jonathan.

672
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:03,955
My baby loves me,
she always makes me feel fine.

673
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:07,749
She loves me,
she lets me know that she's mine.

674
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:09,558
And when she kisses...

675
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:13,829
And then I ask her
if everything is okay,

676
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:17,749
I get my answer,
the only thing I can say,

677
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:20,435
I say "Yeah, yeah."
Your turn.

678
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:28,989
- Say it!
- Yeah, yeah...

679
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:32,033
is what I say.

680
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:35,231
Oh, what I'm gonna do to you.

681
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,436
- I have an appointment with Mr. Ruiz. Ruiz?
- Ruiz, that's right.

682
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:46,990
- Ruiz. I'm Jonathan McQuarry.
- I was told to expect you. One moment.

683
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:53,109
McQuarry.

684
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:58,636
Okay, this way. Excuse me. The young lady,
she's also on the account?

685
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:02,589
- No. She's my personal secretary.
- I see.

686
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:06,870
Well, only those on the account
are permitted in Mr. Ruiz' offices.

687
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:08,518
I do apologize.

688
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:11,592
- Would you mind if I waited here?
- Wait here if you like.

689
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:16,279
This way, please.

690
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:30,235
Mr. Lopez-Poline, our Bank Manager.
He will take care of you now.

691
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:32,880
- Mr. McQuarry. Buenos dias.
- Buenos dias.

692
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:36,713
I understand you wish to close
your account with us today.

693
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:39,473
I'm afraid so.
I require some extra liquidity.

694
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:43,394
Of course. I need to see your passport
and you will need to sign a few documents.

695
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:45,639
Here you are.

696
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:01,632
- Gracias.
- Gracias.

697
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:05,834
And tell me, will the co-signer
be joining us shortly?

698
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:09,520
- Excuse me?
- The co-signer on this account.

699
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:12,797
We will need his information as well
before we can release the funds.

700
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:17,550
- The co-signer.
- Yes, sir.

701
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:21,394
When this money was transferred
there was a request for a co-signature

702
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:24,278
to release the funds.
I have it right here.

703
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:31,352
A Mr. Bose, Wyatt Bose,
is listed on the account as well.

704
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:35,397
- Wyatt Bose.
- Yes, Mr. McQuarry.

705
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:38,876
According to our records

706
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:42,270
you yourself requested the co-signature
when you transferred these funds.

707
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:46,515
Yes, I know I did, but it's just...

708
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:53,435
It's not a problem. I can sort this out.

709
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:59,950
Please tell Mr. Ruiz I'll be back shortly.

710
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:02,832
Okay.

711
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:36,591
- Hello.
- Are you free tonight?

712
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:41,158
- Jonathan.
- I said, are you free tonight?

713
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:44,799
Yes, I am.

714
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:57,679
Hello, Jonathan.

715
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,070
My God, I'm a handsome devil.

716
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:11,916
The hair isn't quite right.
You losing some on top, there?

717
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:15,472
- Regardless, you look well.
- For someone you thought you'd killed.

718
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:19,278
I want half.

719
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:24,077
Careful. The suit doesn't make
the man, Jonathan.

720
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:27,472
I stole 20 million dollars.
I figure I'm entitled to some of it.

721
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:32,552
There are two signatures required
to release those funds.

722
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,991
You thought of everything, didn't you?

723
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:41,674
Without me that money doesn't
move anywhere. I want half.

724
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:48,319
Okay. Let's do it.

725
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:58,837
- Señor Bose.
- Thank you.

726
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:00,353
Señor McQuarry.

727
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:09,911
Would you sign there, Mr. McQuarry,
please?

728
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:19,630
Two suitcases, ten million each.

729
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:23,992
Well, everything seems to be in order.

730
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:27,068
Mr. McQuarry, Mr. Bose...

731
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:30,636
please sign here and here.

732
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:35,672
Thank you. Please follow me.

733
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:44,073
All yours.

734
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:06,599
Well, here we are, Jonathan.
Spain, a suitcase full of money.

735
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,992
A lot of people would give everything
to feel what we're feeling right now.

736
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:14,711
I'm curious.
How did you know you’d been played?

737
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:18,349
- You made a mistake.
- I made a mistake?

738
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,992
The photo you sent me
was taken a few weeks ago.

739
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:24,711
Before the pipe behind her
caused the stain.

740
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:33,032
- I knew she was in on it.
- No longer. She took off.

741
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:36,919
Where is she?

742
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:39,995
She really got under your skin,
didn't she?

743
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:45,832
I'll give you half my share
if you tell me where she is.

744
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,479
Is that so?

745
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:53,315
Let's go somewhere quiet and make a deal.

746
01:28:57,680 --> 01:29:00,478
She fell for you, Jonathan.
It's true.

747
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:04,911
I think she may have even loved you.

748
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:11,950
She's a very special girl, and I think
she's worth more than half your share,

749
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:13,871
but then again...

750
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:48,555
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

751
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:02,192
- Wait! Wait! I need to talk to you.
- No. Get out of here, Jonathan.

752
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:05,556
- I came here hoping I would see you again.
- You know nothing about me.

753
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:07,631
You don't even know my name.

754
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:11,512
So I was just part of the plan,
is that it? Everything.

755
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:15,956
I wanted to call it off.
That night in Chinatown.

756
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:19,797
- I didn't know he was gonna try
to kill you. I'm so sorry. - Don't go.

757
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:26,872
Take care of yourself.

758
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:53,471
Norbert Lewman... the Super.
