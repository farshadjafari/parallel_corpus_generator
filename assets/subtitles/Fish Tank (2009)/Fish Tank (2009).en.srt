Keeley its me.
What are you doing?

3
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,078
I've left three messages.
I said sorry didn't I?


4
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,634
You know me. I was pissed off
.

5
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,273
Get back to me, bitch.

6
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,799
Tyler, what are you doing?

7
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:44,549
What does it look like?

8
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,877
Yields, Mia!
Keeley is not there.

9
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,192
I have a message for her.

10
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,790
His father is a big motherfucker!

11
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:59,597
I'll get you one day!

12
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,438
You'd be so fucking lucky!

13
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,275
You waited a long time

14
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,312
Now I'm here

15
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:39,350
I know I should not have

16
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:41,358
Making you wait that long

17
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,950
I had much to do

18
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:48,109
But I imagined
All I want you to

19
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,990
I know all the guys

20
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,989
s Story  through me
Like no other girl

21
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,949
They know I'm good

22
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,116
They fantasize about me

23
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,912
But you're the only
What I want today

24
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,992
And you want me too

25
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,158
What's your problem?

26
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:18,431
You dance like a dung.

27
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:19,948
Do not bother, Mia.

28
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,878
So Keeley
you hang with tuna?

29
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,151
You've seen, dirty gypsy?

30
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,992
You're going to complain?

31
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,712
Get out!

32
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,194
Get out, bitch!

33
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,277
If you want more,
Come get me!

34
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,195
Bitch!

35
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,515
Get out!

36
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,033
What are you doing?

37
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:13,956
You think?

38
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,911
Get out!

39
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,677
Hello. It's me.

40
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,952
Police looking for you.
This girl has a broken nose.

41
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,514
- I have not started!
- Dirty liar!

42
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,870
- It's his fault.
- You bet! You'll see ...

43
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,194
Let me go, Mom.

44
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,514
Let me go!

45
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,990
I let you go, little bitch!

46
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:57,038
What's your problem?

47
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,879
It is you, my problem!

48
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:47,990
is my beautiful room.

49
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,947
Joanne will kill you.

50
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,629
The headboard is beautiful.
It was carved for me

51
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,793
heart shape.
I love hearts.

52
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:06,075
There,
is my casual clothes.

53
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,958
Y  all my jeans,
and I have a max.

54
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,753
You had to stay here.

55
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,513
My sexy tracksuit  ...

56
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,875
Do not be afraid.

57
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,955
Hello.

58
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:53,995
- It's private property.
- My ass!

59
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:55,871
She wants to have fun.

60
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:59,591
We gonna party.
In addition, she has enough booze.

61
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:03,711
- Why did you that?
- To nail you dick.

62
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,513
You mijotes something.

63
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,908
Give me that!

64
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,474
We'll have fun.

65
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:10,715
Let me go!

66
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,428
Calm.

67
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,798
It is not partying.

68
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:31,028
Touch me!

69
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,398
It has a little fun.

70
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:34,995
Leave me!

71
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,109
Let me go!

72
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:44,038
Let me go, assholes!

73
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:47,273
Go ahead, mug it.

74
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:53,072
Stop fidgeting.

75
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,952
Let me go, fuck!

76
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,508
We just want to laugh.

77
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,270
Do not worry about me, continue.

78
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,629
I enjoyed it.

79
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,149
Exactly.

80
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:22,879
You make eggs?

81
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:23,797
No.

82
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:26,993
For what, water?

83
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,514
I make tea.

84
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,432
I am a friend of your mother.

85
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:41,351
You dance like a Black.

86
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,149
It's a compliment.

87
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,668
Where'd you get that?

88
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,230
I watch videos,
like everyone else.

89
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:52,750
And it makes you a specialist?

90
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,827
You're answer to everything?

91
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,879
What's your name?

92
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,668
As you wish.

93
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,350
You know your world charm.

94
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:34,196
See you later.

95
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,798
I met one of your daughters.

96
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,513
And you're still around?

97
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,077
You made me tea!

98
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,196
What are you doing?

99
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,798
Never mind, little bitch.

100
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,395
Never mind yourself, big bitch.

101
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,028
I'm already late.

102
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,038
Go, stay.

103
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,836
See you later.

104
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:01,596
- You play what?
- At the door.

105
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,395
I can go out?

106
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,635
Must pay to open the door.

107
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,433
- How?
- 2 lbs.

108
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,914
Holy shit, is not given.

109
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,788
Here.

110
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,713
Stop!
Give me the money!

111
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,273
I want a discount.

112
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:30,153
Okay. A book, dirty rat!

113
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,873
OK. Deal.

114
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,913
I love you.
I'll kill you last.

115
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:43,632
Tyler! Let me go.

116
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,112
He said, "See you later."

117
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,752
Your lovely kid coming back?

118
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:33,032
I invited some friends.

119
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:35,555
You go into your room
or outside.

120
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:36,875
One like the other.

121
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,991
It has nothing to fuck
of your friends.

122
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:43,917
They're all fat morons.

123
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,913
You look like a giggle!

124
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,673
Bitch!

125
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,837
Call SOS Children Beaten.

126
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:01,598
You too, you're a slut!

127
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,472
You got the nerve to come back.

128
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:36,996
Shut up.

129
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:39,990
Good.

130
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:43,115
You're the pot
my brothers are not there.

131
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,833
They took my business.

132
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,960
That's not what you think.
She is old.

133
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,993
You've dropped your dog express
yesterday?

134
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,109
He is strong.

135
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:16,431
Did you get the bowl
not bite you.

136
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,675
That's right, sucker.

137
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:24,712
My guests are there,

138
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,911
finished but I prepare myself.

139
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,115
They make themselves up to death.

140
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,998
It's super gross.

141
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,072
It must be his house.

142
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,596
You see?

143
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:40,999
It is his mother?

144
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:42,679
Damn, the big pile!

145
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,148
They are tainted.

146
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,318
His smile is atrocious
She has yellow teeth.

147
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,914
Definitely green.

148
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:56,838
Soon they will be pink.

149
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,272
She might like it.

150
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:01,796
When I enter the tent

151
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,118
and be admired,
will be magic.

152
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,038
This cider is perfect,
There's no denying it.

153
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:09,798
There will be short.

154
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:12,712
Hello shame!

155
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,512
Dirty bitch friquÃ©e.

156
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:16,236
Fat bitch.

157
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,749
Shut up, Mia.

158
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:20,394
You, your mouth.
I leave in a minute.

159
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,390
Hello, beautiful.

160
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,679
You're a big acorn.

161
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,792
If it was so large
I could convert.

162
00:21:58,079 --> 00:21:59,115
Can I come?

163
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,238
're Unrecognizable, dressed.

164
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:04,396
- You're really a dick.
- I know.

165
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,229
You're late.

166
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:14,349
But I'm here.

167
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,756
- I'm more.
- I had to change.

168
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,074
In your room.

169
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:01,076
We recognize it
when she sleeps.

170
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,751
- Shoot it.
- It's good.

171
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,829
I'll handle this.

172
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,667
You're too nice.

173
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,634
At the end of the corridor.

174
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:21,951
She treats me like a kid.

175
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,958
At your age,
we live with my mom more.

176
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,638
I was kicked out of my house.

177
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:35,828
Go get dressed.

178
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,513
I am dressed.

179
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,109
You're almost naked.

180
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,432
You do not care, usually.

181
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,797
Here, it bothers me.
Go get dressed.

182
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:52,593
Why do you take that voice?

183
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:54,828
It moves?

184
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:56,758
- You go where?
- Nowhere.

185
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,712
So why did you say,
"It moves?"

186
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:02,432
We will drive around.

187
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,709
Want to come?

188
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:06,316
- Both?
- Forget it.

189
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:07,395
I want to come.

190
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,353
It goes nowhere.

191
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,028
I do not care, I want to come.

192
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,155
Go get dressed.

193
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,432
Thank you.

194
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,109
And you?

195
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:23,028
It said nothing.

196
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:25,752
Check in 20 minutes.

197
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:27,394
You're better to do.

198
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,316
You know what? That tells me much.

199
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,513
- Where are we going?
- Good question.

200
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:43,875
At the orphanage.

201
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:46,477
That sucks, you're not nice.

202
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,118
First
'd have at least been able to shave.

203
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,070
Why?

204
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:53,351
Out of respect for me.

205
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,358
- I like that you like me?
- You got too much hair.

206
00:28:58,079 --> 00:28:59,512
Me, I think you're beautiful.

207
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,550
Thank you.

208
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:04,156
What?

209
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,833
You're weird stuff.

210
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:08,950
Anything.

211
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,355
Really weird.

212
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,789
Bobby Womack
is anything but bizarre.

213
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,154
You're how old?

214
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,474
The age thing.

215
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,835
I will have to
your education.

216
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,513
Mets thoroughly.

217
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,037
At your command.

218
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,597
leaves are brown

219
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:47,756
And the sky is gray

220
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:51,590
I walk aimlessly

221
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,871
By a winter's day

222
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,955
It would  sweeter

223
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,955
If I  L.A.

224
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,390
I dream  California

225
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,435
For this winter's day

226
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:17,198
I saw a church

227
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:20,910
I stopped

228
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:26,470
I knelt

229
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:29,592
And I began to pray

230
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:34,477
The priest blesses the cold

231
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,316
Because he knows that I'll stay

232
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,352
It's called an airship.

233
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:52,749
It's too good!

234
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:53,871
Mom!

235
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,634
I have seen.

236
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:57,709
We see more.

237
00:30:59,079 --> 00:30:59,910
Look.

238
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,914
Too good.

239
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,553
It's super cool.

240
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:09,949
In what animal
you want to be reincarnated?

241
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,230
In monkey.

242
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:13,108
In white tiger.

243
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:14,992
Somewhat bitch.

244
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,233
What kind of dog?

245
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,669
Race.

246
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,233
You're already a bitch.

247
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,115
Stop!

248
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,311
Me, I'd be an eagle. "
Your animals are terrestrial.

249
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:27,078
You would not fly?

250
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:30,116
You'd get shot.

251
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,115
Why not?

252
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,755
We could shoot you,
true.

253
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:35,711
I want to pick blackberries.

254
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,228
I want a drink.

255
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:38,269
It is.

256
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,395
Let me show you something.

257
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,072
- Come.
- We show what?

258
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:53,236
Come on, moron!

259
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:00,709
Wait.

260
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:13,833
So, you like it?

261
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,152
I would have been better in flip flops.

262
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,476
You are perfect like that.
Come here.

263
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,588
Hey, lovers!

264
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,633
It's nice here!

265
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,439
There must be millions
dÃ©gueus insects.

266
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,269
Stop! You're not interested!

267
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,069
There's a dragonfly, Mia!

268
00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:54,628
Look there.

269
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:57,275
On the worksheet. You see?

270
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:00,238
Mashed, it has six legs!

271
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,115
1, 2, 3 ...

272
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:06,798
- Shut up.
- I see it.

273
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,590
Soaring.

274
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,558
I'll catch a fish.

275
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:13,115
- Are you kidding?
- I go. You coming?

276
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,627
You're dreaming!

277
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,512
Without me, thank you.

278
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:17,868
Sissies.

279
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:22,594
You're grounded.

280
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:29,348
I need help.

281
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,628
You can scratch you.

282
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,308
- We'll end up with water.
- No way!

283
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,669
No way.

284
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:37,999
Nobody ever comes here.

285
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:40,191
Fish are animals,
will be easy.

286
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,515
I expect to see.

287
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:43,635
Super.

288
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:44,829
Come on.

289
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,712
Always ready, that one.

290
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:56,515
It is dirty?

291
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,673
Running Your cost me 20 pounds.

292
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:03,113
It is not possible.

293
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,789
Bravo.

294
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:12,956
Come.

295
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,269
Go gently.

296
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:16,788
She can not swim!

297
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,748
Your feet atrocious
will drive them away!

298
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:28,394
They believe
it's a fish-off

299
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,032
who comes to eat!

300
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:33,277
Moving slowly toward me.

301
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:36,597
Did he affected?
You'll have a poissonite!

302
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,748
You see the fish?

303
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:45,514
You go ahead ...
Not yet.

304
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,556
Slowly.

305
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,835
Stop.

306
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:24,317
He caught one!

307
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,753
He glides, that bastard!

308
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,829
He died?

309
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:57,871
You think he dances, woodcock?

310
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,719
What are you doing?

311
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:09,996
- It's brutal.
- It's better for him.

312
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,155
You bet!

313
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,110
We eat?

314
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,152
I would not even touch.

315
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,952
It's like fried fish.

316
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:18,514
No, he is whole and full of shit.

317
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,677
- I do not eat it.
- I do.

318
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:21,990
Bravo.

319
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,599
It would have surprised.

320
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:26,958
Help! AIDS!

321
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,516
Watch.

322
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,954
You will survive.

323
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,148
Mom hates blood.

324
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,873
Your socks will have AIDS,
Connor.

325
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:48,355
Who's Kelly?

326
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,355
On your arm.

327
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:55,039
Just one example.

328
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,547
There's a spider.

329
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,476
Mia

330
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:09,876
Wait.

331
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,987
Climb on my back.

332
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,235
You all right?

333
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,436
I have nothing more to say.

334
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,429
We made the turn.

335
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,108
I do not know.

336
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,068
Well, okay.

337
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:10,391
Pass me a while ago.

338
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,516
You okay?

339
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,235
The family bullshit.
We'll have to go.

340
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,510
You've promised to cook the fish.

341
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,434
- Your mother was not bored.
- I know.

342
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:34,353
I'll drop you.

343
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:38,675
We just drink a nightcap?
Please. Go!

344
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:41,710
Go. It's me who pays.

345
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,315
Okay, a little manipulative.

346
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:45,918
I hurry.

347
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,197
See if you can dance it.

348
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:07,668
It is zero!

349
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,632
This is not true. I saw it.

350
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:18,554
Can you do that?

351
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,159
I'm barefoot.

352
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,873
What a stupid excuse!

353
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:36,592
This is not dancing!

354
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,510
Move!

355
00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:00,309
It will not be accepted?

356
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:04,159
I'm going to pee.

357
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:05,190
Continue!

358
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,389
Shut up!

359
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:08,032
It was nice to you.

360
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,833
I do not care.
I have the right not to love.

361
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,552
It's a pain in the ass, I told you.

362
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,353
- She thinks not.
- I love you not!

363
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:20,235
There is no mates in two days!
You know us!

364
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:23,030
She is barefoot.

365
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,389
It's not far off, it will kill it.

366
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,507
I like dogs.

367
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,472
We'll talk
when you have eaten the arm.

368
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,836
There's someone down for you.

369
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:08,148
Stand!

370
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:11,396
All right.

371
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:13,907
I'm up.

372
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,597
Do not bother, I come!

373
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,835
Here it is.

374
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:32,391
Good morning. I'm Carrie.

375
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:34,112
Will you talk about?

376
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:35,275
What?

377
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:36,992
In ancient history, cretin.

378
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:40,476
- I can drink before?
- Sure.

379
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:43,309
You're making
in this special school.

380
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:47,353
When she was born,
she cried for days.

381
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,708
One would think she had
malice in the blood.

382
00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:54,079
You have another daughter?

383
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,074
Yes. Tyler.

384
00:41:57,239 --> 00:41:58,467
She sticks the same cotton.

385
00:41:59,639 --> 00:42:01,914
It too would
by being kicked out of school.

386
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:03,952
It's hard when you're alone.

387
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,318
You can tell.

388
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:08,992
The place where she goes,

389
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:11,277
like?

390
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,434
How far?

391
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,028
I have no car.

392
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,188
Come back here!

393
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:32,032
You kidding me?

394
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,958
I will enter this shop
and when I go out,

395
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:39,559
I'm different.

396
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,148
Different!

397
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,630
You dig? Different.

398
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:47,596
Unlike other, you,
worldwide.

399
00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:53,798
Club Luxury
seeks talented young dancers

400
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:02,349
Is it me or it schlingue here?

401
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:03,594
It beats serious.

402
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,871
Some of us should
take a bath.

403
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:08,434
You got the eye swelling.
Your father missed your mouth?

404
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:09,755
You bars?

405
00:44:10,039 --> 00:44:13,429
Touch me or I'll
another black eye!

406
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:14,708
Get out!

407
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,751
You got that face!

408
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:56,036
Hello.

409
00:44:57,679 --> 00:44:58,873
I was passing by.

410
00:45:00,039 --> 00:45:01,677
How did you know where I work?

411
00:45:02,519 --> 00:45:03,396
You said.

412
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:09,193
What's New?
I thought you hated me.

413
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:11,914
You're a puzzle balls.

414
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:13,349
Thank you.

415
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,235
Not enough.

416
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:17,994
And your foot?

417
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:19,275
Okay.

418
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:25,074
Hold on.

419
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:39,994
Take off your shoes.

420
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,557
- I can do.
- Not as good as me.

421
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:06,231
That ever happen to wash?

422
00:46:23,719 --> 00:46:24,835
It is like new.

423
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,992
What are you doing with your days?

424
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:37,559
I have things planned.

425
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:02,307
You are going?

426
00:47:03,239 --> 00:47:05,117
- I know.
- Go ahead, you're good.

427
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:11,753
Say nothing to my mother.

428
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,713
I'll have what in return?

429
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,193
You need a camcorder?

430
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,157
They say to send a demo.

431
00:47:20,519 --> 00:47:22,271
I can lend you my camera.

432
00:47:25,039 --> 00:47:26,074
On one condition.

433
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,429
Which?

434
00:47:30,519 --> 00:47:32,351
You'll smile on the video.

435
00:47:33,639 --> 00:47:35,311
You're pretty when you smile.

436
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,193
I'm back to work.

437
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,710
I will chum with you
some time.

438
00:47:47,559 --> 00:47:48,628
Does it bother you?

439
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,798
Your mother has fired?

440
00:47:51,519 --> 00:47:52,509
More or less.

441
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,635
It's me, Tennents big moron.

442
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:32,793
Is not blocking you
you cut it there-

443
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,594
You go on Guarded Centre
in 2 weeks.

444
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,318
You've got a camcorder?

445
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:00,554
You scared me.

446
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,193
Give me one second.

447
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:14,992
Who's the best?

448
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:17,115
Thank you.

449
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,594
- How does it work?
- It's easy.

450
00:49:36,519 --> 00:49:37,509
You light up here.

451
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,192
Forget not to lower the cache.

452
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,478
Red button to record.

453
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:46,632
You press and it filmed.

454
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:49,998
You will take the shot quickly.

455
00:49:51,079 --> 00:49:52,068
Awesome.

456
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:22,989
How do you think?

457
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:29,195
Honestly?

458
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:30,635
Sure.

459
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,318
From fox piss.

460
00:50:37,679 --> 00:50:39,989
You deserve a beating, girl!

461
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:41,833
For me spied.

462
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:43,472
For your insolence.

463
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,797
To be planted
social worker.

464
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,235
Connor!

465
00:50:47,639 --> 00:50:49,550
You worry tires cheap,
this time.

466
00:50:50,199 --> 00:50:50,757
Dinner.

467
00:50:51,039 --> 00:50:53,030
I'm coming.
I was spinning my camcorder to Mia.

468
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,672
She'll break it.

469
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,836
If she does that, look out the beating.

470
00:50:59,559 --> 00:51:00,548
It smells good.

471
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:03,639
I've done a good steak.

472
00:51:08,039 --> 00:51:13,193
My name is Mia Williams.
My number is 07700 900 542.

473
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,269
My name  Mia Williams.
My number is 07700 ...

474
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:18,838
Have you nearly finished?

475
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:21,117
What I meddle, microbe?

476
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,798
I'm going to pee.

477
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:25,552
Go ahead, I look at it.

478
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:28,755
No.
Or you close your eyes.

479
00:54:29,159 --> 00:54:31,673
I can not, I might cut myself.

480
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:39,958
Wait for me.

481
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:42,028
You follow me?

482
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:43,829
Yes, so what?

483
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,079
How is your mare?

484
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:50,668
Did you hear?

485
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,199
That's not what you think.

486
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,074
I think what?

487
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,190
Let her starve.

488
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:58,958
It seems, anyway.

489
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,556
She is old, I told you.

490
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:04,188
Where you going?

491
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:06,875
Search for something.

492
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:08,875
What thing?

493
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,717
You're as curious girl.

494
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:14,398
Can I come with you?

495
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,230
If you want to.

496
00:56:23,159 --> 00:56:24,275
Give me that.

497
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:28,193
Take support here.

498
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:50,394
It is not bad.

499
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,679
It's just a show.

500
00:56:58,320 --> 00:56:59,355
What are you looking?

501
00:57:00,719 --> 00:57:02,755
A Volvo 940.

502
00:57:03,559 --> 00:57:04,833
It looks like what?

503
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:06,599
In a Volvo 940.

504
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,793
Very clever, head node.

505
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,478
And here. Volvo 940.

506
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:28,268
This is a car like any other.

507
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:29,594
There's not often.

508
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:34,871
They are super strong.

509
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:44,548
You want more?

510
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:49,559
Keep watch.

511
00:58:06,519 --> 00:58:07,838
I like not here!

512
00:58:08,519 --> 00:58:09,873
I for one minute.

513
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:14,637
I know where to find the Bethune
to buy a drink.

514
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:19,672
I know where to find the Bethune
to buy a drink!

515
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:23,789
Good!

516
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:32,835
I.

517
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:37,157
You have much luck, you know.

518
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:38,750
Come on.

519
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:40,347
We will tear.

520
00:58:46,519 --> 00:58:47,315
Hold on.

521
00:58:48,199 --> 00:58:49,427
All right, get up.

522
00:58:52,639 --> 00:58:53,867
Fuck your mother!

523
00:59:41,719 --> 00:59:42,469
Gotcha!

524
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,076
Descend.

525
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,153
Come down.

526
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:52,873
You're not funny.

527
00:59:53,159 --> 00:59:54,878
I'm supposed to work there.

528
00:59:56,519 --> 00:59:57,509
What do you want?

529
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,119
We need Bethune.

530
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:01,795
Oh yeah?

531
01:00:04,599 --> 01:00:05,588
You're stuffed?

532
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:10,148
You got a 5 bill?

533
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,476
I paid
to transfer the pochetrons.

534
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:13,590
Do not shit.

535
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:15,873
I have nothing on me.

536
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,559
Look.
This boy is very thin.

537
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:24,757
It was the slab, we must eat.
I'll pay you back.

538
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,635
- I'm not a kid.
- That I know.

539
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:34,793
There's something to eat?

540
01:01:35,199 --> 01:01:37,952
Have you seen the time?
Do you believe in coffee?

541
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,916
In Thailand? Aggressiveness zero.

542
01:02:00,199 --> 01:02:02,554
Japan? Same story.
But in Russia  ...

543
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:09,036
we feel first in Russia,
is anger.

544
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:13,155
I hate nothing but think again.

545
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,398
You're still my camcorder?

546
01:02:22,199 --> 01:02:23,076
You want it?

547
01:02:24,159 --> 01:02:25,512
So it is safe ...

548
01:02:27,159 --> 01:02:28,114
He is.

549
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,594
Some streets
stink of money, full nose.

550
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,108
snow.

551
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,833
The chicks are covered
to the eyes ...

552
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:39,079
You go out with this boy?

553
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:42,996
Why?

554
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,637
It looks a bit old for you.

555
01:02:48,199 --> 01:02:49,188
It is 1 9.

556
01:02:50,679 --> 01:02:52,351
It has never been a guy.

557
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:57,190
I just hit me up there.

558
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:58,309
It is elegant.

559
01:03:01,239 --> 01:03:02,228
You can talk.

560
01:03:04,199 --> 01:03:05,393
It goes to bed?

561
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:12,951
In bed, the Sleeping Beauty.

562
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,829
Is your new school.
You'll live.

563
01:03:24,119 --> 01:03:26,759
You'll be able to type
all the lads that you want.

564
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:46,349
It's smart.

565
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:47,990
I will not go.

566
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:50,349
They may teach you
politeness.

567
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:52,074
It's none of your business.

568
01:03:55,079 --> 01:03:56,559
Did you need discipline.

569
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:00,509
You've already said.
Who are you to lecture me?

570
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:31,670
It's only two weeks.

571
01:04:32,599 --> 01:04:33,952
I can not believe it.

572
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:39,512
It is super easy to live.

573
01:04:48,039 --> 01:04:50,998
There's this thing ...
As soon as I saw him I knew.

574
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:54,913
Stop your bullshit!

575
01:04:56,719 --> 01:04:57,675
Anything.

576
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,438
They are only good for one thing

577
01:05:00,719 --> 01:05:03,597
and I can tell you
it assures that side.

578
01:05:06,039 --> 01:05:06,916
I know!

579
01:05:06,039 --> 01:05:06,916
I know!

580
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:14,438
Stop angst around,
you meet someone.

581
01:05:17,199 --> 01:05:18,952
Are you going to Ann Marie?

582
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:21,875
At 21 pm?

583
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:27,353
At any hour.

584
01:05:32,679 --> 01:05:34,829
You have a new message.

585
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:38,797
Mia Williams
Your demo we liked.

586
01:05:39,679 --> 01:05:42,512
Can you hear
next week

587
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:47,112
Remember us at 01708 665 001.

588
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:48,115
I'm Val.

589
01:08:00,719 --> 01:08:01,835
Put your arm here.

590
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,797
It's good. The other arm.

591
01:08:09,239 --> 01:08:10,389
Climbs the stairs.

592
01:08:10,679 --> 01:08:11,748
Sorry.

593
01:08:12,519 --> 01:08:13,713
I took one.

594
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:14,670
I know.

595
01:08:16,359 --> 01:08:18,873
I must sleep.
You think it'll be tomorrow?

596
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:22,957
Do not worry.
It will be fine tomorrow.

597
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:25,708
You swear?

598
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:26,954
I swear.

599
01:09:17,159 --> 01:09:18,229
You're still standing?

600
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:20,198
I had stuff to do.

601
01:09:28,079 --> 01:09:29,512
We again become friends?

602
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:30,311
What?

603
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:34,838
You were weird with me.

604
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:36,715
You, you were weird.

605
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:39,636
Really?

606
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:43,876
Maybe.

607
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:57,518
Your mother is in the polish.

608
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:58,436
As usual.

609
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:05,875
You like booze in the family.

610
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,712
It's pretty, your hair loose.

611
01:10:16,399 --> 01:10:19,710
It's better than your ponytail
usual.

612
01:10:24,199 --> 01:10:25,757
I got a hearing.

613
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:27,715
Bravo.

614
01:10:30,279 --> 01:10:31,234
It surprises me not.

615
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:37,233
I've borrowed a CD.

616
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:39,435
What song?

617
01:10:40,479 --> 01:10:41,753
California Dreamin '.

618
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:45,149
You had spent in the car.

619
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,036
This is my favorite song
the world.

620
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:53,479
You show me?

621
01:10:54,199 --> 01:10:55,234
You're dreaming!

622
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:58,439
Go.
If not you'll get there before me,

623
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:01,868
how will you
before all these people?

624
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:04,751
Especially since I found
you-insured

625
01:11:05,479 --> 01:11:06,435
You know.

626
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:09,231
I licking this evening.

627
01:11:10,359 --> 01:11:11,838
It is not yet ready.

628
01:11:13,359 --> 01:11:14,509
It was to help.

629
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:20,314
It's up to you.

630
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:40,238
I am only here for now.

631
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:43,876
Come here.

632
01:13:51,159 --> 01:13:51,989
Come here.

633
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:04,787
It was really good.

634
01:14:08,319 --> 01:14:09,719
You say it like that.

635
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,034
I'm serious.

636
01:14:12,479 --> 01:14:14,595
If it were me, I advise.

637
01:16:04,039 --> 01:16:07,112
I bet it's not like that
with your boyfriend.

638
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,591
Its tail is as big?

639
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:05,548
I'm drunk.

640
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:12,268
We screwed up.

641
01:17:14,039 --> 01:17:14,869
No.

642
01:17:26,479 --> 01:17:28,310
It must remain between us.

643
01:17:30,439 --> 01:17:31,350
I know.

644
01:18:02,119 --> 01:18:03,997
I'd better go to bed.

645
01:18:05,279 --> 01:18:06,155
I'm wiped.

646
01:18:12,279 --> 01:18:13,474
We'll talk tomorrow.

647
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:05,793
Connor is gone.

648
01:19:41,359 --> 01:19:42,429
Connor!

649
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:07,034
I told you that I almost
abort you?

650
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:11,596
I even made an appointment.

651
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:25,798
You're going to call?

652
01:20:31,399 --> 01:20:32,354
It will not.

653
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:33,828
You know shit.

654
01:20:34,239 --> 01:20:36,275
Si I'm going to tell Mom.

655
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:37,872
I have nothing to fight.

656
01:20:49,359 --> 01:20:52,351
Here  Connor. Leave a message
and I'll call you.

657
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:06,475
118 008.
Can I help you?

658
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:08,073
Wickes, Barking.

659
01:21:08,319 --> 01:21:10,550
moment.
I put you in relationship?

660
01:21:15,359 --> 01:21:16,189
Mia

661
01:21:17,239 --> 01:21:18,354
I was looking for.

662
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:20,192
Wickes, Barking. I listen.

663
01:21:20,439 --> 01:21:23,113
Me want to talk to Connor
it is a security officer.

664
01:21:23,359 --> 01:21:24,155
Where are you going?

665
01:21:24,399 --> 01:21:26,595
Connor O'Reilly
He is on leave.

666
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:28,068
It is when?

667
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:29,635
next Friday.

668
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:31,756
- When?
-  Next Friday.

669
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:38,515
Where's that, Tilbury?

670
01:21:39,079 --> 01:21:41,070
It is on the A13 in that direction.

671
01:21:42,359 --> 01:21:43,429
Can I come?

672
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:46,671
I have personal stuff to do.
See you later.

673
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:27,636
Excuse me. Danton Road?

674
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:30,474
In the new subdivision,
on the right.

675
01:23:53,119 --> 01:23:54,519
Damn!

676
01:23:55,319 --> 01:23:56,195
Come here.

677
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:57,671
Come

678
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:04,479
How you found me?
It is not smart.

679
01:24:05,359 --> 01:24:06,997
You do not answer the phone.

680
01:24:07,239 --> 01:24:08,514
I have more battery.

681
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,274
I was going to call you.

682
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:14,158
You're not even my number.

683
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:20,831
You know I love you.

684
01:24:21,079 --> 01:24:22,752
Why you're gone, then?

685
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:29,913
You know very well.

686
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,114
You have 15 years.

687
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:36,318
It's irrelevant if you're in love.

688
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:44,518
I'll take you to the station,
we speak in the car.

689
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,676
Wait for me. Hold on.

690
01:25:10,039 --> 01:25:11,597
When is the audition?

691
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:13,475
Tomorrow.

692
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:15,828
You'll provide.

693
01:25:39,359 --> 01:25:40,475
I have no money.

694
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:55,876
That should be enough to return.

695
01:26:18,039 --> 01:26:18,994
Come here.

696
01:26:25,479 --> 01:26:26,628
Fits well.

697
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:29,238
I'll call you tomorrow.

698
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:45,708
Shoot!

699
01:30:38,279 --> 01:30:39,474
Come on, sweetie.

700
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:40,715
It's yours.

701
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:44,591
Keira sings for Dad.

702
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:51,511
I said no to love
and its torments

703
01:30:52,399 --> 01:30:55,994
I tried my luck
whenever vain

704
01:30:56,239 --> 01:31:00,028
The days marched
and my heart froze

705
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:06,074
But something new
happened with you

706
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:09,639
My heart back to life,
the evidence was there

707
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:12,712
people around me
cry to dementia

708
01:31:15,119 --> 01:31:18,715
No matter what they say,
is you I love

709
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:20,837
They can not

710
01:31:21,079 --> 01:31:22,512
cons obviously

711
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:55,675
Bravo

712
01:31:59,039 --> 01:31:59,949
Mouse candy.

713
01:32:02,439 --> 01:32:03,997
Make a smile for Dad.

714
01:34:34,119 --> 01:34:35,552
Keira! Not on the road.

715
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:36,710
I know.

716
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:43,670
Keira.

717
01:34:51,439 --> 01:34:54,351
Your mom told me
to take you to buy an ice cream.

718
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:55,475
Come.

719
01:34:55,720 --> 01:34:56,515
Let's go.

720
01:34:58,119 --> 01:34:59,792
Race you?

721
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:08,313
We'll go through it.

722
01:35:10,039 --> 01:35:10,836
Give.

723
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:14,628
My scooter!

724
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:18,030
It is not practical here.
You will take to return.

725
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:22,470
Mom!

726
01:35:23,439 --> 01:35:26,273
It's a game
Quickly, you must run.

727
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:28,319
- Keira?
- Mom!

728
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:33,390
Advance.

729
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:34,788
I do not want!

730
01:35:35,039 --> 01:35:37,759
Forward or I'll shoot.

731
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:55,949
I want to go home!

732
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:00,828
Keira, advance.

733
01:36:05,079 --> 01:36:06,637
Enough. Advance.

734
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:18,909
You're scaring me!

735
01:36:23,640 --> 01:36:24,435
Hurry!

736
01:36:29,119 --> 01:36:30,951
Stop it. Climb.

737
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:38,076
- Raise your legs, brothel.
- Shut up!

738
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:39,315
Go.

739
01:37:42,039 --> 01:37:43,154
Wait for me!

740
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:44,750
Stop!

741
01:37:52,039 --> 01:37:53,472
Stop run away!

742
01:37:56,680 --> 01:37:58,078
You think that's smart?

743
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:00,993
Poor little idiot.

744
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:02,872
I can do the same.

745
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:44,637
Stop run away!

746
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:49,630
Let me go!

747
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:57,909
You're no better than your father!

748
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:02,073
Stop hitting me!

749
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:00,590
You okay?

750
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:03,988
I'm cold.

751
01:40:04,479 --> 01:40:05,310
You're cold?

752
01:40:23,479 --> 01:40:24,707
Go on, get.

753
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:32,551
It was sublime, honey.

754
01:44:33,239 --> 01:44:35,800
Absolutely sublime.
You shall be called.

755
01:44:36,319 --> 01:44:37,594
Thank you for coming.

756
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:41,953
- It is great.
- Who's Next?

757
01:44:43,880 --> 01:44:46,269
Is that Mia is there?
Mia Williams?

758
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:01,113
What song?

759
01:45:01,359 --> 01:45:02,429
17.

760
01:45:12,359 --> 01:45:15,113
You can remove your hair,
please?

761
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:29,479
It's much more feminine.

762
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:32,828
You do not have a body?

763
01:45:34,159 --> 01:45:35,114
Shorts?

764
01:45:36,640 --> 01:45:37,755
It's okay.

765
01:45:38,479 --> 01:45:39,355
Go.

766
01:46:10,159 --> 01:46:11,672
What is this story?

767
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:49,350
Hello.

768
01:46:51,880 --> 01:46:52,994
It's your car?

769
01:46:54,920 --> 01:46:56,637
Still missing parts.

770
01:47:04,239 --> 01:47:05,719
You forgot your hat.

771
01:47:16,640 --> 01:47:17,868
And your mare?

772
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:23,994
She was sick.

773
01:47:25,279 --> 01:47:26,599
He took it down.

774
01:48:10,840 --> 01:48:12,193
She was 16.

775
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:16,118
She had outlived its usefulness.

776
01:48:38,279 --> 01:48:41,078
Should see
if the engine goes the distance.

777
01:48:43,720 --> 01:48:45,516
I know people in Cardiff.

778
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:47,708
Wales.

779
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:36,756
Why do you take all this?

780
01:49:38,600 --> 01:49:39,828
If.

781
01:49:45,119 --> 01:49:47,110
And Center
of Special Education?

782
01:49:49,359 --> 01:49:50,712
I leave my place.

783
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:54,077
I want to.
There's that Gogol there.

784
01:50:27,479 --> 01:50:28,798
I'm going.

785
01:50:31,159 --> 01:50:32,717
It's one of your CDs.

786
01:50:37,239 --> 01:50:38,194
Not bad.

787
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:42,835
Is Nas. It is good.
Keep it.

788
01:50:48,680 --> 01:50:49,510
Go.

789
01:50:51,159 --> 01:50:52,194
Fuck off.

790
01:50:53,800 --> 01:50:55,118
What you waiting for?

791
01:52:22,239 --> 01:52:23,639
Where are you going already?

792
01:52:25,199 --> 01:52:26,679
Wales.

793
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:36,390
You have not changed my mind, then?

794
01:52:41,279 --> 01:52:42,917
This is my sister, Tyler.

795
01:52:43,159 --> 01:52:43,956
Hi, Tyler.

796
01:52:44,760 --> 01:52:46,078
You're a gypsy?

797
01:52:46,319 --> 01:52:47,309
Shut up.

798
01:52:47,560 --> 01:52:48,470
Bitch.

799
01:52:50,720 --> 01:52:52,038
I hate you!

800
01:52:56,399 --> 01:52:57,389
I hate you too


801
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:16,635
See you later boy


802
01:53:18,520 --> 01:53:19,475
See you later


803
01:53:24,520 --> 01:53:25,555
All right?


804
01:53:43,279 --> 01:53:44,234
Hello, bitch!

805
01:53:44,479 --> 01:53:45,912
Dont forget to text me


806
01:53:46,159 --> 01:53:48,515
Say hello to the welsh for me
