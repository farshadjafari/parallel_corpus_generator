1
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:27,951
He slaughtered our men,

2
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,382
our brothers,

3
00:03:32,742 --> 00:03:34,343
our sons.

4
00:03:36,023 --> 00:03:40,240
But they cry out to us for justice.

5
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:44,612
For their souls, I swear to you

6
00:03:44,932 --> 00:03:47,803
the man who took our loved ones from us,

7
00:03:48,314 --> 00:03:52,295
the man who brought us such pain and sorrow,

8
00:03:53,677 --> 00:03:56,068
we will punish him.

9
00:03:56,437 --> 00:03:59,489
We will bring him... here.

10
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:01,710
We'll not rest

11
00:04:01,731 --> 00:04:07,037
until his blood flows into this very ground.

12
00:04:08,317 --> 00:04:11,129
We will have our revenge.

13
00:04:32,132 --> 00:04:35,214
- Sir? Excuse me.
- Yeah.

14
00:04:35,634 --> 00:04:38,114
But the finish is included
in the cost of the wash.

15
00:04:38,155 --> 00:04:42,888
That's okay, I'd rather do it myself,
I'm a little obsessive that way.

16
00:05:24,935 --> 00:05:26,996
- Lenore.
- Bryan.

17
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:29,728
- Hi, how are you?
- Fine, you?

18
00:05:29,758 --> 00:05:32,037
- Good, good.
- Somethin' up?

19
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:36,482
No. It's Saturday, 2 o'clock.
Kim's driving lesson?

20
00:05:36,641 --> 00:05:38,312
Yeah, music lesson got switched.

21
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:43,799
- The Tuesday one or the Friday one?
- I have no idea.

22
00:05:44,619 --> 00:05:45,606
You know how kids are.

23
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:47,304
Um-huh! Especially those who're desperate

24
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,636
to pass their driving test at their third try.

25
00:05:49,681 --> 00:05:50,602
She's not desperate.

26
00:05:50,682 --> 00:05:54,446
But she failed the test twice, Leny.
It's important.

27
00:05:55,024 --> 00:05:56,942
So ... where is she? Really.

28
00:05:59,606 --> 00:06:03,648
- I've never been a good liar, have I?
- No, it's not your forte.

29
00:06:05,078 --> 00:06:07,954
She met her boyfriend.

30
00:06:11,415 --> 00:06:13,327
She has a boyfriend?

31
00:06:13,386 --> 00:06:14,922
Do you want to come in for a drink?

32
00:06:15,858 --> 00:06:18,521
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I think you should, okay.

33
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,909
Why didn’t she tell me, for God's sake?

34
00:06:22,981 --> 00:06:25,236
She probably didn't want
you running a full security

35
00:06:25,237 --> 00:06:27,492
check of everything thing
he's done since kindergarten.

36
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,803
But she's okay, right?

37
00:06:34,321 --> 00:06:35,512
Yeah, she's okay.

38
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:43,046
Tell me it's none of my business, but ...

39
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,357
Are you okay?

40
00:06:48,245 --> 00:06:49,329
No.

41
00:06:50,488 --> 00:06:55,464
Not really, you know, we've separated.

42
00:06:56,225 --> 00:06:59,847
Well, is there nothing I can do?

43
00:07:00,907 --> 00:07:04,549
Well, I better... thanks for the wine.

44
00:07:05,078 --> 00:07:09,524
- Bryan! Don't.
- I don't even know where the kid lives.

45
00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:12,844
You found her in a city of
12 million people within 72 hours.

46
00:07:14,203 --> 00:07:15,735
- Promise me.
- I just told you...

47
00:07:15,784 --> 00:07:20,280
- Promise!
- I'm gonna give her her space.

48
00:07:59,082 --> 00:08:00,463
Hi.

49
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,397
Can I help you?

50
00:08:05,805 --> 00:08:06,410
Is Kim here?

51
00:08:06,516 --> 00:08:08,540
- Yeah, and you are...?
- Her father.

52
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:11,632
Mr. Mills, what a pleasure, I'm Jamie.

53
00:08:13,553 --> 00:08:14,386
Come in.

54
00:08:17,145 --> 00:08:20,423
- Can I get you anything? A drink or...
- Just my daughter would be fine.

55
00:08:21,637 --> 00:08:23,554
- Dad?
- Hi.

56
00:08:23,828 --> 00:08:24,898
What are you doing here?

57
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:27,862
Well, I know how important it is
for you pass your tests.

58
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,787
Wait! Kim you don't have a license.?

59
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,661
Have you ever tried to parallel park an Escalade?

60
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:34,081
I told you to take the test with my car.

61
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:35,768
Dad.

62
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:40,431
Thank you.

63
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,675
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Mills.

64
00:08:51,475 --> 00:08:54,748
Could we slow down a little bit, please.

65
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:57,026
I can't believe you could do that.

66
00:08:57,228 --> 00:08:59,096
You're leaving in fall, right, next week.

67
00:08:59,143 --> 00:09:02,518
It's the only time I can get
to do this before I go to Istanbul.

68
00:09:02,534 --> 00:09:04,593
We planned this.
When you make plans, you keep them...

69
00:09:04,655 --> 00:09:06,378
No, Dad, you planned it.

70
00:09:07,117 --> 00:09:09,655
- How did you even find me?
- Your mom and I were talking...

71
00:09:09,718 --> 00:09:11,253
Why didn't you tell me you have a boyfriend?

72
00:09:11,329 --> 00:09:15,252
Because I knew you'd over-react and I just
wanted to be normal, even if I'm just pretending.

73
00:09:16,531 --> 00:09:18,835
- Remember to break before stop.
- Dad!

74
00:09:23,498 --> 00:09:25,548
Mom doesn't know where Jamie lives.

75
00:09:29,451 --> 00:09:30,459
GPS?

76
00:09:31,202 --> 00:09:33,346
I had it installed on your phone, I'm sorry.

77
00:09:33,442 --> 00:09:37,626
It's just... you hear so many scary stories
of goings-on of people your age.

78
00:09:37,695 --> 00:09:41,622
Dad, I don't even know how to start feeling
normal again, but this definitely isn't it.

79
00:09:43,999 --> 00:09:45,118
Kim, you can move.

80
00:09:58,729 --> 00:10:00,201
Use your side mirror.

81
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:15,694
Perfect! Why couldn't you do that in the test?

82
00:10:16,962 --> 00:10:17,824
I don't know.

83
00:10:18,633 --> 00:10:21,776
Maybe I didn't really want a license.
Listen...

84
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,008
Of course I know where you're coming from.

85
00:10:25,275 --> 00:10:27,272
But you gotta trust me to figure this out.

86
00:10:28,808 --> 00:10:31,923
- Don't do this again, please.
- I won't.

87
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,340
And don't go running a background
check on him with your friend.

88
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,462
I won't.

89
00:10:39,064 --> 00:10:39,915
Okay.

90
00:10:40,267 --> 00:10:44,295
- See ya Wednesday.
- Au revoir.

91
00:10:44,848 --> 00:10:47,633
- Love you.
- Hey, I love you.

92
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,196
One moment.
A package came for you.

93
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,764
- I'll meet you inside.
- As you wish, Sir.

94
00:11:30,469 --> 00:11:31,252
Your mail.

95
00:11:35,141 --> 00:11:36,351
Sebastian.

96
00:11:59,996 --> 00:12:03,100
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

97
00:12:06,402 --> 00:12:07,139
Okay.

98
00:12:12,602 --> 00:12:14,152
You want to play with me?

99
00:12:22,102 --> 00:12:24,577
But then, you could play her tomorrow.

100
00:12:24,698 --> 00:12:24,699
- Taken 2 (2012)
- IMDB #1397280
- Created by DonToribio (Subscene.Com moniker)
- October 18, 2012 posted first to Subscene.
- Version: Taken 2 2012 TS XviD AC3-ADTRG

101
00:12:36,998 --> 00:12:39,763
- Look.
- No! No!

102
00:12:41,314 --> 00:12:44,751
Again the rules are changing.

103
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,606
- What's happened? Are you okay?
- Yeah, no, I'm great.

104
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:34,092
I'll... come in, I'll get Kim.

105
00:13:34,192 --> 00:13:35,287
Hey, hey,  hey, hey!

106
00:13:36,878 --> 00:13:39,124
- Leny, talk to me.
- We...

107
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,289
We had this trip planned to
China for Kim's spring break...

108
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:46,901
the family, you know, to
try and work things out.

109
00:13:47,203 --> 00:13:50,931
And when Stu and I... we thought
it'd be nice for Kim and I to...

110
00:13:50,932 --> 00:13:54,560
you know, to be away... together,
away from all the tension.

111
00:13:54,598 --> 00:13:57,934
- Sure.
- They cancelled everything, all the reservations.

112
00:13:58,652 --> 00:14:00,633
I just can't believe he did that to us.

113
00:14:05,075 --> 00:14:07,817
I'm tired of the fighting, the lawyers ...

114
00:14:08,627 --> 00:14:13,422
- He's turned into such a bastard.
- I'm sorry, Leny, I'm sorry.

115
00:14:15,431 --> 00:14:18,186
I'm sorry, this is really not your problem.

116
00:14:18,502 --> 00:14:22,705
It's my turn to have Kim for the fall,
I'll take care of that.

117
00:14:23,318 --> 00:14:26,648
Look, why don't you and
Kim come with me?

118
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:30,799
But, we can't impose on you,
you're working.

119
00:14:30,812 --> 00:14:33,308
You're not imposing,
I'm working for 3 days.

120
00:14:33,383 --> 00:14:36,853
Then you could come over, it... could be fun.

121
00:14:37,174 --> 00:14:38,503
That's so sweet.

122
00:14:39,715 --> 00:14:41,977
I do not know, I... just...
I can't think of right now.

123
00:14:42,057 --> 00:14:44,181
Sure, I understand, I understand, no pressure.

124
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:47,580
I leave in the morning,
I work three days. Call me.

125
00:14:47,663 --> 00:14:51,171
If you're coming, I'll hang around,
if not I'll come back. That's it.

126
00:14:51,526 --> 00:14:54,118
- I'll go get Kim.
- Okay.

127
00:14:54,147 --> 00:14:55,807
Thank you, Bryan.

128
00:15:06,182 --> 00:15:08,509
- She is definitely coming?
- I don't know.

129
00:15:08,604 --> 00:15:10,223
- Come on.
- Come on, Sam, I don't know.

130
00:15:10,278 --> 00:15:13,958
- You should have insisted.
- Come on, guys, cut me some slack.

131
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,952
She's going through a hard time,
I didn't want to make it harder on her.

132
00:15:16,971 --> 00:15:19,067
- She was confiding in me.
- Oh!

133
00:15:19,162 --> 00:15:20,844
Well, I didn't know you guys
were still so cozy, that

134
00:15:20,943 --> 00:15:23,815
she shares her marriage issues with you.

135
00:15:24,135 --> 00:15:26,539
Wait a minute, I mean, I mean,
I know you guys were close, obviously

136
00:15:26,606 --> 00:15:30,228
but are you, like close again,
close like... you know?

137
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:33,749
- Lay money she still got something for him.
- Don't got there, friend.

138
00:15:33,823 --> 00:15:36,163
- Whoa! Maybe he still has something for her.
- Well, that's...

139
00:15:36,215 --> 00:15:39,341
Could we talk about basketball,
for God's sake! Come on!

140
00:15:55,874 --> 00:15:57,576
Istanbul.

141
00:16:06,923 --> 00:16:08,111
Thank you, Mr. Mills.

142
00:16:08,754 --> 00:16:11,012
You made my stay feel very secure.

143
00:16:15,247 --> 00:16:17,135
Thank you, have a safe trip home.

144
00:16:17,358 --> 00:16:18,579
You also.

145
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,955
You reached Lenore,
leave a message after the beep.

146
00:16:37,161 --> 00:16:38,517
Hey, it's me.

147
00:16:38,952 --> 00:16:40,113
No message from you

148
00:16:40,213 --> 00:16:42,824
so I guess probably found some place to go.

149
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:45,486
I hope things are a little easier.

150
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:49,061
If you ever need to talk
or anything, well, I'm here.

151
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:50,622
I mean, I'll be there.

152
00:16:50,892 --> 00:16:53,103
I'll probably ship-out tomorrow.

153
00:16:53,593 --> 00:16:58,066
No news from Kim, so I guess
she's busy with the boyfriend, and all.

154
00:16:58,305 --> 00:16:59,446
Dad!

155
00:17:00,976 --> 00:17:03,908
- Surprise!
- My God, Kim, baby!

156
00:17:05,228 --> 00:17:07,110
- Hello, Leny.
- Hello, hi.

157
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:10,361
I was just leaving you a message...
when I didn't hear...

158
00:17:10,641 --> 00:17:13,826
- We wanted to surprise you.
- Well, you succeeded.

159
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:17,518
You guys could've been surprised,
I coulda been outta here and headed home.

160
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:20,211
- Mom's been calling Sam.
- Oh yeah?

161
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,877
- Uh-huh, yes
- We've been tracking YOU.

162
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,622
Not exactly, you're not the only
one who's got moves, you know?

163
00:17:24,902 --> 00:17:28,073
Apparently not!
Welcome to Istanbul.

164
00:17:35,657 --> 00:17:38,546
- Not too shabby, huh?
- Wow!

165
00:17:39,203 --> 00:17:40,834
Oh, my God!

166
00:17:41,164 --> 00:17:43,494
Mom, Mom, look at this.

167
00:17:44,334 --> 00:17:47,097
- Oh my God!
- Crazy, right?

168
00:17:47,486 --> 00:17:49,627
- Thank you so much.
- My pleasure.

169
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:53,680
But, listen, I'll let you get settled and I'll come
and collect you, in what. half an hour?

170
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:55,332
Okay.

171
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:57,425
Later.

172
00:18:26,422 --> 00:18:28,722
Pass.

173
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:06,164
<i>The cause is still being investigated,</i>

174
00:19:06,276 --> 00:19:11,207
<i>but a source... actually in the area at
the time of Thursday's crash.</i>

175
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,641
<i>on the island of Corsica.</i>

176
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:16,929
<i>After the... made an unauthorized entrance
the ship then keeled over on its side.</i>

177
00:19:17,015 --> 00:19:18,265
- Hey.
- Hey.

178
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:20,727
- You look great.
- You, too.

179
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:23,387
So, where are we heading?

180
00:19:23,637 --> 00:19:26,745
Well, I am going nowhere, I'm beat,

181
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:30,991
so I'm just gonna take a
nice, long bath and get into bed.

182
00:19:31,261 --> 00:19:33,953
- Leny, are you sure?
- Yeah.

183
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:36,653
I guess it's just you and me, Kiddo.

184
00:19:42,341 --> 00:19:44,842
So, on this side is Europe

185
00:19:45,262 --> 00:19:48,294
and the other side is Asia.

186
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:53,486
And every conquest since,
for the last 2 thousand 500 years

187
00:19:53,786 --> 00:19:56,618
whether it was the West going east
or the East going west,

188
00:19:56,918 --> 00:19:59,378
they all used this very same waterway.

189
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,300
- Do you want tea, Babe?
- Yeah.

190
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,081
Just one, please.

191
00:20:04,401 --> 00:20:06,066
So, how do you know all this stuff.

192
00:20:06,766 --> 00:20:10,458
How do I know? I read it in a book

193
00:20:11,239 --> 00:20:14,861
on the flight over.
And you can borrow it if you wish.

194
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,491
Yeah, I would.

195
00:20:17,192 --> 00:20:19,712
So... uh... this...

196
00:20:20,393 --> 00:20:23,524
Jamie... is it... serious?

197
00:20:23,844 --> 00:20:26,096
I wasn't really ready for this transition.

198
00:20:28,866 --> 00:20:31,882
I don't know, it's only been a few months.

199
00:20:32,163 --> 00:20:34,063
Are you in love with him?

200
00:20:35,544 --> 00:20:37,665
I guess I'm not sure yet.

201
00:20:37,955 --> 00:20:42,578
- Have you ever been in love before?
- Not...

202
00:20:43,569 --> 00:20:46,570
Not the way that mom talks about it.

203
00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:48,310
How does she describe it?

204
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,917
She said when you guys he met... that...

205
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,688
- It was Super Special.
- Super Special.

206
00:20:56,938 --> 00:21:00,600
- She said that?
- I think the exact word she used was:

207
00:21:01,881 --> 00:21:03,411
Magical.

208
00:21:05,741 --> 00:21:07,353
Magical, huh?

209
00:21:49,281 --> 00:21:51,302
It is good to see you again, my friend.

210
00:21:53,983 --> 00:21:56,364
Is everything prepared?

211
00:21:56,764 --> 00:21:58,555
As you requested.

212
00:21:59,126 --> 00:22:00,396
Perfect.

213
00:22:45,226 --> 00:22:46,816
- Yeah?
- They're in the lobby.

214
00:22:47,096 --> 00:22:48,288
Wait until he's outside,

215
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,568
<i>and remember... alive.</i>

216
00:22:52,879 --> 00:22:55,441
He's looking at me, I'm leaving.

217
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,092
- Hey.
- Hi.

218
00:23:13,362 --> 00:23:15,123
I thought we were having lunch in the Bazaar.

219
00:23:16,374 --> 00:23:19,696
Jet lag just hit me so I figured
I'd veg-out at the pool

220
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:23,141
and let you guys go and meet-up with you later.

221
00:23:23,232 --> 00:23:25,492
- I guess, okay with you?
- Okay, fine.

222
00:23:25,743 --> 00:23:26,553
Okay, bye.

223
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:27,491
- Hey, Kim.
- Yeah.

224
00:23:27,764 --> 00:23:30,025
That book I was telling you about,
it's on my dresser.

225
00:23:30,856 --> 00:23:32,445
- Definitely.
- No adventure.

226
00:23:32,695 --> 00:23:34,497
- I’ll go call a car.
- Have fun.

227
00:23:35,217 --> 00:23:40,019
- Hey, Kim. I know what you're doing.
- What?

228
00:23:47,417 --> 00:23:48,438
Yeah?

229
00:23:48,788 --> 00:23:51,559
The daughter is still here so what can we do?

230
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:53,590
I want all 3 of them.

231
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,621
Yes.

232
00:23:58,822 --> 00:24:01,974
She thinks we just fell off the turnip truck.

233
00:24:02,243 --> 00:24:05,045
- What do you mean?
- She's trying to play Cupid.

234
00:24:05,335 --> 00:24:06,515
Oh, I see.

235
00:24:06,806 --> 00:24:08,707
You know? When you first
came back and said you

236
00:24:08,784 --> 00:24:11,054
wanted to make-up for all
the time you lost with Kim?

237
00:24:11,108 --> 00:24:14,483
- Uh-huh.
- Is that right! Three weeks he's gone.

238
00:24:14,784 --> 00:24:17,184
That was usually the full limit you stuck around.

239
00:24:17,494 --> 00:24:18,846
Give or take a week.

240
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,178
We're too close.

241
00:24:23,497 --> 00:24:26,529
You really proved me wrong,
I thought you'd never change.

242
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:30,111
- Why not?
- Ah... you're personality.

243
00:24:30,371 --> 00:24:32,262
You know, when you commit to something, ya gotta

244
00:24:33,313 --> 00:24:36,298
focus all your energy there,
like a dog with a bone.

245
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,849
Nice analogy.

246
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:40,320
You know what I mean.

247
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,991
When you give, it's 100 percent of 100 percent.

248
00:24:44,271 --> 00:24:46,893
If I was on to something, it was just that thing,

249
00:24:47,282 --> 00:24:49,964
even though I tell myself something should change,

250
00:24:50,274 --> 00:24:51,905
I can never give it up.

251
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:57,338
- You gave us up.
- No, never.

252
00:24:57,738 --> 00:24:58,949
Not in here.

253
00:25:16,321 --> 00:25:18,882
Driver, turn left.

254
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:23,974
Leny, don't.

255
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:26,880
What?

256
00:25:31,061 --> 00:25:33,933
- Will you tell me what's going on?
- It's okay.

257
00:25:40,285 --> 00:25:41,647
Move!

258
00:25:46,009 --> 00:25:48,470
See the gallery entrenched in
the middle of the block?

259
00:25:48,731 --> 00:25:50,695
- Will you tell me what's going on?
- Do you see it?

260
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,166
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I see it.

261
00:25:52,245 --> 00:25:54,382
When we stop, I want you to get out of the car.

262
00:25:54,476 --> 00:25:56,939
While you're a shopper I want you to get inside.

263
00:25:57,238 --> 00:25:58,718
Okay, but will you tell me what's going on!

264
00:25:58,868 --> 00:25:59,619
- Listen to me!
- Tell me what's happening!

265
00:25:59,848 --> 00:26:00,971
Listen, Leny! There's no time for this!

266
00:26:01,221 --> 00:26:03,001
- Please talk to me!
- Listen!

267
00:26:03,051 --> 00:26:05,872
At the lights at the back of the
fabric store, turn right.

268
00:26:06,112 --> 00:26:09,464
Take the first street on the right,
and then left on the very next street.

269
00:26:09,504 --> 00:26:12,044
Go straight until you come to a set of steps.

270
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:14,980
There's a red corridor. It's a lane.

271
00:26:15,401 --> 00:26:18,652
When you exit the lane,
there's a cab stand.

272
00:26:18,712 --> 00:26:22,425
Go back to the hotel, get Kim,
get the head of hotel security

273
00:26:22,674 --> 00:26:25,235
and demand they cordon-off your room.

274
00:26:25,516 --> 00:26:27,396
Do not open the door for anyone.

275
00:26:27,747 --> 00:26:30,027
No room service,
no police, no one!

276
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,298
- You wait for me.
- I can't believe this is happening.

277
00:26:32,369 --> 00:26:33,959
I need you to focus.

278
00:26:36,981 --> 00:26:39,002
- Are you ready?
- No.

279
00:26:39,262 --> 00:26:41,917
Leny, I need you to be ready.
I need you to be ready!

280
00:26:42,157 --> 00:26:44,398
Come on, focus.
Driver! Stop!

281
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:49,041
- Okay, go.
- Wait, what about you?

282
00:26:49,271 --> 00:26:50,161
I'll be fine.

283
00:26:50,441 --> 00:26:52,452
The guys following us are about to have a problem.

284
00:26:52,772 --> 00:26:54,182
When the dog has a bone,

285
00:26:55,156 --> 00:26:57,244
the last thing you want to
do is try to take it from him.

286
00:27:03,017 --> 00:27:04,372
Be careful.

287
00:27:07,703 --> 00:27:08,684
Out of the car.

288
00:27:09,414 --> 00:27:11,035
Come on!
Move, move, move!

289
00:27:15,187 --> 00:27:16,428
Sir! Please!

290
00:27:17,749 --> 00:27:19,479
Please, Sir!

291
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:23,901
He knows.

292
00:27:24,511 --> 00:27:25,852
Do it now.

293
00:27:45,336 --> 00:27:46,025
Come on!

294
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:08,640
Shit!

295
00:28:22,211 --> 00:28:24,261
Come on, Kim,
answer the God damn phone!

296
00:29:26,689 --> 00:29:27,789
God, no!

297
00:29:28,089 --> 00:29:31,932
Somebody help me!
The key! Open the door! Please!

298
00:29:32,986 --> 00:29:34,277
Shit!

299
00:31:30,437 --> 00:31:32,078
I'll blow his brains out.

300
00:31:37,936 --> 00:31:39,326
Bryan!

301
00:31:40,826 --> 00:31:44,099
- Please.
- Drop the gun.

302
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,051
- I really wish you were here.
- Me too.

303
00:31:50,621 --> 00:31:52,102
<i>You have no idea.</i>

304
00:31:53,102 --> 00:31:55,694
<i>- What?
- My dad's calling,</i>

305
00:31:55,953 --> 00:31:57,184
<i>he's on a date with my mom.</i>

306
00:31:59,911 --> 00:32:00,590
Don't go away.

307
00:32:00,591 --> 00:32:02,400
<i>I miss you.</i>

308
00:32:05,583 --> 00:32:08,734
- How's it going?
- Listen to me carefully, Kim.

309
00:32:10,044 --> 00:32:15,067
Your mother...
and I... are going to be taken.

310
00:32:16,046 --> 00:32:16,881
Daddy!

311
00:32:17,222 --> 00:32:18,551
Oh, my God.

312
00:32:18,758 --> 00:32:20,689
People are going to come for you, too.

313
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,430
<i>Leave the place where you are, call me.</i>

314
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:25,556
<i>Go to where the book is I told you about.</i>

315
00:32:25,876 --> 00:32:28,118
There's the door. Go into the room

316
00:32:28,387 --> 00:32:30,518
and hide in the closet. You got that?

317
00:32:30,808 --> 00:32:33,510
- Yeah.
- Good, I'll call you.

318
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:35,111
Go... now!

319
00:32:50,141 --> 00:32:51,151
No!

320
00:33:19,639 --> 00:33:21,760
She is in room 4-22.

321
00:33:38,689 --> 00:33:40,103
1, 2,

322
00:33:40,603 --> 00:33:43,845
3, 4, 5, 6...

323
00:33:46,235 --> 00:33:47,316
Right turn...

324
00:33:49,988 --> 00:33:52,089
Men singing...

325
00:34:03,155 --> 00:34:05,990
1, 2, 3...

326
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:12,572
4, boat...

327
00:34:21,286 --> 00:34:22,718
The pool.

328
00:34:33,076 --> 00:34:35,477
Security, 4th floor. Can you hear me?

329
00:34:36,008 --> 00:34:37,608
Send someone now.

330
00:34:37,969 --> 00:34:42,220
25, 26, 27...

331
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:48,053
28, 29, stop.

332
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:28,940
Hammer on metal.

333
00:35:41,616 --> 00:35:44,082
Left, gear shift to second.

334
00:35:44,362 --> 00:35:47,403
1, 2, 3...

335
00:35:48,904 --> 00:35:50,384
Birds.

336
00:36:06,852 --> 00:36:08,997
Take them to the shop... straight.

337
00:36:50,161 --> 00:36:52,071
Right turn, 27.

338
00:36:55,604 --> 00:36:56,798
Then stop.

339
00:39:23,567 --> 00:39:25,401
Come on, Sam, pick up.

340
00:39:26,503 --> 00:39:29,334
Hey, this is Sam, leave me a message.

341
00:39:29,693 --> 00:39:31,054
Shit.

342
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:40,989
- Are you guys okay?
- No, no.

343
00:39:41,319 --> 00:39:43,771
- Are you all right?
- Yes

344
00:39:44,291 --> 00:39:48,973
- I'm just scared.
- Kim, listen to me very carefully.

345
00:39:49,917 --> 00:39:52,789
I need you to calm down
and pull yourself together.

346
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:56,701
The men who came for you, did they leave?

347
00:39:56,981 --> 00:39:58,802
Yes, what did they want?

348
00:39:59,252 --> 00:40:04,104
- I'm going to find out.
- Is Mom okay?

349
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:08,677
- Dad?
- Mom's fine.

350
00:40:08,977 --> 00:40:10,868
<i>Good.</i>

351
00:40:11,107 --> 00:40:12,609
What are we gonna do?

352
00:40:12,889 --> 00:40:14,914
I want you to go to the U.S. embassy.

353
00:40:15,194 --> 00:40:17,775
- You'll be safe there.
- What about you and Mom?

354
00:40:19,365 --> 00:40:21,286
I'll figure something out.

355
00:40:22,557 --> 00:40:26,129
- Where are you now?
- I don't really know, Kim.

356
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:28,630
<i>Dad, how can I tell them where to find you, then?</i>

357
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:30,680
You can't. Now get going.

358
00:40:31,082 --> 00:40:33,041
- No.
- Kimmy.

359
00:40:33,153 --> 00:40:37,084
- No, tell me what to do.
- No, Kim.

360
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:39,159
Dad, if you tell me what to do, I can do it.

361
00:40:39,459 --> 00:40:41,850
- Kim, this is not a game.
- I know that.

362
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,681
It’s my parents' lives.

363
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:45,462
<i>Dad, please,</i>

364
00:40:45,852 --> 00:40:47,543
<i>you're wasting time.</i>

365
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:53,516
<i>Please,</i>

366
00:40:53,796 --> 00:40:55,287
tell me what to do.

367
00:40:56,638 --> 00:40:59,869
Can you get out of the closet safely?

368
00:41:04,645 --> 00:41:06,006
Yes

369
00:41:06,405 --> 00:41:09,227
If you can, take the case with you.

370
00:41:10,928 --> 00:41:11,814
Okay.

371
00:41:22,364 --> 00:41:24,524
- I'm aff!
- The combination is:

372
00:41:24,844 --> 00:41:28,140
2-3, 2-8, 8-4.

373
00:41:35,933 --> 00:41:36,615
<i>It is open?</i>

374
00:41:36,616 --> 00:41:37,294
Yes!

375
00:41:37,535 --> 00:41:39,756
- Okay, do you see a map?
- Yeah.

376
00:41:40,006 --> 00:41:42,575
Take the map, you'll see a scale

377
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:44,048
<i>on the top in kilometers.</i>

378
00:41:44,477 --> 00:41:45,513
<i>Do you see it?</i>

379
00:41:47,021 --> 00:41:48,762
Yeah, I see it.

380
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:51,221
Take a shoelace from one
of my shoes in the closet.

381
00:41:51,652 --> 00:41:53,697
<i>Use it as a guide.</i>

382
00:41:56,287 --> 00:42:00,089
<i>There's a pen in the case, take it.</i>

383
00:42:00,339 --> 00:42:00,913
<i>Draw a circle</i>

384
00:42:00,941 --> 00:42:02,740
with the hotel in the center of it.

385
00:42:05,052 --> 00:42:05,770
It's done!

386
00:42:05,931 --> 00:42:06,737
Make the diameter

387
00:42:06,798 --> 00:42:09,864
<i>3 kilometers. You got that?</i>

388
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:19,075
<i>It's done!</i>

389
00:42:19,112 --> 00:42:21,553
Draw another circle with the market in the center.

390
00:42:24,233 --> 00:42:24,917
<i>Okay!</i>

391
00:42:24,951 --> 00:42:25,428
Do the circles

392
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:26,586
<i>intersect at any point?</i>

393
00:42:27,176 --> 00:42:28,226
<i>No.</i>

394
00:42:29,837 --> 00:42:32,238
Now take one of those little cans.

395
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:33,930
<i>The ones with the pins on the top.</i>

396
00:42:34,189 --> 00:42:35,123
<i>It's a grenade. I want you to</i>

397
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:37,381
go to the balcony with the grenade.

398
00:42:39,222 --> 00:42:41,633
Is there a safe place you can throw it?

399
00:42:45,418 --> 00:42:47,920
- There’s a parking garage.
- Anyone on it?

400
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:51,472
- No.
- I want you to pull the pin out of the grenade,

401
00:42:51,751 --> 00:42:52,913
count to 3 so that I can hear it,

402
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:54,903
and toss it as far as you can.

403
00:42:55,184 --> 00:42:56,467
<i>Then run back into the room,</i>

404
00:42:56,724 --> 00:42:59,466
keep the phone on so
I hear the explosion.

405
00:43:02,056 --> 00:43:05,498
1, 2, 3.

406
00:43:13,956 --> 00:43:17,751
1, 2, 3, 4.

407
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,230
- Dad?
- Now draw a circle on the map.

408
00:43:23,591 --> 00:43:25,040
<i>Put the hotel on the mid-line</i>

409
00:43:25,137 --> 00:43:28,684
and the circumference
at 4 point 5 kilometers.

410
00:43:35,289 --> 00:43:36,028
<i>Okay.</i>

411
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:38,962
Do the circles intersect at any point?

412
00:43:39,193 --> 00:43:40,402
Yes, two points.

413
00:43:40,643 --> 00:43:42,753
I'm at one of the two intersecting points.

414
00:43:43,024 --> 00:43:44,036
<i>Now, go outside and</i>

415
00:43:44,136 --> 00:43:45,845
look at the flags on the rooftops.

416
00:43:46,945 --> 00:43:48,497
<i>Do you see the flags?</i>

417
00:43:50,297 --> 00:43:52,718
- Yes
- Are they in the wind?

418
00:43:53,299 --> 00:43:56,124
- Yes
- Going east, right?

419
00:43:57,415 --> 00:43:59,025
I think so, yeah, how do you know?

420
00:43:59,275 --> 00:44:00,255
Now look at the map.

421
00:44:00,616 --> 00:44:01,821
I want you to go to the point

422
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,261
<i>where the circles intersect at the east.</i>

423
00:44:04,638 --> 00:44:06,139
I want you to take one of the guns,

424
00:44:06,419 --> 00:44:07,810
get to a rooftop, wait for my call,

425
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:13,392
And two of the grenades. You go to the
rooftop at the most easterly point.

426
00:44:14,432 --> 00:44:17,304
Get up to the rooftop, wait for my call.

427
00:44:17,725 --> 00:44:20,870
Be casual, Kim,
blend in.

428
00:44:20,871 --> 00:44:21,984
Okay.

429
00:44:24,451 --> 00:44:25,302
Dad?

430
00:44:27,673 --> 00:44:28,984
Dad?

431
00:45:17,393 --> 00:45:19,151
What are you doing?

432
00:45:19,196 --> 00:45:25,437
This is an employees' locker room!
Wait! Stop!

433
00:45:56,717 --> 00:45:58,611
Do you know this man?

434
00:46:04,926 --> 00:46:06,426
This one?

435
00:46:08,087 --> 00:46:10,948
- This one?
- No.

436
00:46:12,468 --> 00:46:13,889
This one?

437
00:46:15,191 --> 00:46:18,041
- What do you want?
- You recognize none of them.

438
00:46:18,302 --> 00:46:24,083
To you they were nothing, but to
other people they are... sons,

439
00:46:24,579 --> 00:46:26,759
and grandsons,

440
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:31,271
fathers and husbands.
And you killed them all.

441
00:46:32,852 --> 00:46:35,203
Like they were so many nothings.

442
00:46:42,037 --> 00:46:43,667
And this one?

443
00:46:45,307 --> 00:46:46,959
Do you recognize him?

444
00:46:47,369 --> 00:46:49,764
You DO recognize him.

445
00:46:50,095 --> 00:46:53,456
And you didn't just kill him,
you strapped him to a chair.

446
00:46:53,786 --> 00:46:56,527
you touched electric cables to the chair

447
00:46:56,628 --> 00:46:58,206
you turned the current on,

448
00:46:58,228 --> 00:47:02,190
and you left it on until his heart burst.

449
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:05,121
He's the one who kidnapped dozens of girls

450
00:47:05,402 --> 00:47:06,702
and ruined their lives.

451
00:47:07,042 --> 00:47:10,545
He was my son, Marko

452
00:47:11,414 --> 00:47:13,366
From Trepoja.

453
00:47:14,009 --> 00:47:18,011
And I have come to take you to Trepoja

454
00:47:18,371 --> 00:47:21,973
to face you to the people
whose lives you ruined.

455
00:47:22,243 --> 00:47:25,324
- To give them justice.
- You mean to give them their revenge.

456
00:47:25,585 --> 00:47:29,157
Because it gives us peace,
call it anything you wish.

457
00:47:29,626 --> 00:47:33,209
I killed your son because
he kidnapped my daughter!

458
00:47:35,559 --> 00:47:37,054
I don't care what he did!

459
00:47:39,298 --> 00:47:40,505
I will know...

460
00:47:41,248 --> 00:47:44,198
I will never see his face again.

461
00:47:44,548 --> 00:47:47,110
I will never hear his voice.

462
00:47:52,412 --> 00:47:55,594
And if you held him responsible
for your daughter,

463
00:47:55,673 --> 00:47:57,794
I hold YOU responsible for him.

464
00:47:59,124 --> 00:48:03,421
Your death will not be quick,
it will not be pleasant.

465
00:48:03,691 --> 00:48:06,573
But before you die, this is what you'll see.

466
00:48:44,824 --> 00:48:48,446
How long will it take for
the blood to rush to her head

467
00:48:48,867 --> 00:48:50,747
and have no place to go?

468
00:48:53,213 --> 00:48:56,994
- About 30 minutes.
- You are right.

469
00:48:57,094 --> 00:49:01,266
You are next for this,
so you have 30 minutes to watch her die.

470
00:49:01,567 --> 00:49:03,297
She had nothing to do with this.

471
00:49:04,077 --> 00:49:06,388
Do what you want with me, let her go.

472
00:49:06,449 --> 00:49:08,190
Don't play the hero with me.

473
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:10,280
Now we're going to get your daughter.

474
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:13,813
She will be sold to the
lowest brothel in this world.

475
00:49:14,822 --> 00:49:17,708
She will be abused by so many men,

476
00:49:17,858 --> 00:49:21,230
for she'll be nothing more than a piece of meat

477
00:49:21,589 --> 00:49:23,431
that a dog would not have.

478
00:49:38,448 --> 00:49:39,848
Don't listen to them, Leny.

479
00:49:40,529 --> 00:49:43,244
Kim is safe, I talked to her.

480
00:49:43,514 --> 00:49:44,795
She's safe.

481
00:49:45,085 --> 00:49:46,826
You have to stay calm.

482
00:49:47,096 --> 00:49:48,827
Breathe slowly, you have to.

483
00:49:49,116 --> 00:49:52,088
I won't let anything happen to you,
or to her... I promise.

484
00:49:59,542 --> 00:50:00,416
Quiet!

485
00:50:00,672 --> 00:50:02,433
We lost the girl.

486
00:50:03,323 --> 00:50:05,864
The girl has gone.
I'll be back as soon as we get her.

487
00:50:06,179 --> 00:50:07,859
Then we move, let's go!

488
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:10,990
Hold on, Leny.

489
00:50:32,815 --> 00:50:34,977
Hold on, Leny, hold on.

490
00:50:46,452 --> 00:50:47,784
Sorry!

491
00:50:53,285 --> 00:50:54,133
Leny!

492
00:50:55,919 --> 00:50:57,146
Leny!

493
00:51:06,105 --> 00:51:08,757
I put your things down here, I'm here.

494
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:35,193
Come on, call!

495
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:36,809
Please.

496
00:51:42,036 --> 00:51:45,452
Leny, I'm coming back.

497
00:51:57,897 --> 00:52:00,269
- I'm here.
- Set-off another grenade.

498
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:16,671
- Dad
- You're close.

499
00:52:16,891 --> 00:52:18,982
<i>I want to keep moving east.</i>

500
00:52:19,342 --> 00:52:20,494
Count to 30

501
00:52:20,503 --> 00:52:21,663
<i>and then set-off another one.</i>

502
00:52:21,944 --> 00:52:24,534
1, 2, 3...

503
00:52:28,487 --> 00:52:30,277
18, 19...

504
00:52:33,469 --> 00:52:37,924
27, 28, 29, 30.

505
00:52:44,687 --> 00:52:46,229
Go out and check what's going on.

506
00:52:53,693 --> 00:52:54,668
Kim.

507
00:52:54,669 --> 00:52:55,644
<i>Yeah?</i>

508
00:52:55,943 --> 00:52:57,479
Look east!

509
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,019
<i>Look for a white cloud of steam!</i>

510
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:02,761
- I see it!
- Run for it,

511
00:53:03,011 --> 00:53:04,411
tell me when you're there.

512
00:53:06,773 --> 00:53:08,143
I'm going down.

513
00:53:24,964 --> 00:53:26,546
- Dad
- Where are you?

514
00:53:26,826 --> 00:53:27,998
I'm right by the steam.

515
00:53:28,148 --> 00:53:30,066
<i>Drop the gun down the vent.</i>

516
00:53:30,338 --> 00:53:32,799
- Those guys are here, they're coming.
- Drop the gun, Kim,

517
00:53:33,219 --> 00:53:35,114
and run!

518
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:37,441
Go!

519
00:53:37,442 --> 00:53:39,211
<i>Dad, they're coming!</i>

520
00:54:12,492 --> 00:54:14,066
I'll be back.

521
00:54:40,033 --> 00:54:42,294
Hey, what are you doing in the hall?

522
00:55:52,801 --> 00:55:53,180
Drop it!

523
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:57,571
On your knees!

524
00:56:01,082 --> 00:56:03,293
Don't do this.

525
00:56:15,269 --> 00:56:16,240
Dad!

526
00:56:16,924 --> 00:56:20,196
Dad! Dad!

527
00:56:26,339 --> 00:56:28,050
Where's Mom? Is she okay?

528
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:30,601
She's safe, she's safe.

529
00:56:40,916 --> 00:56:42,480
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

530
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:05,161
That man had the same
tattoo as the men in Paris.

531
00:57:05,411 --> 00:57:07,806
It's not you they want
Kim, it's me.

532
00:57:22,863 --> 00:57:25,554
I want you to wait here,
I'm going to get mom.

533
00:57:25,715 --> 00:57:30,238
Wait five minutes and if I don't show up,
I want you to go straight here:

534
00:57:30,541 --> 00:57:31,861
The American embassy.

535
00:57:32,233 --> 00:57:34,102
- Tell them what happened.
- Dad.

536
00:57:34,343 --> 00:57:36,033
No time, Kim, give me your phone.

537
00:57:36,093 --> 00:57:38,605
You wait five minutes, not a moment longer.

538
00:57:38,905 --> 00:57:43,167
No matter what happens, time runs out,
you go! You understand me?

539
00:57:43,967 --> 00:57:45,008
Okay.

540
00:59:18,848 --> 00:59:20,148
- Let me go.

541
00:59:25,692 --> 00:59:26,652
Please.

542
00:59:46,686 --> 00:59:47,566
Yes?

543
01:00:13,461 --> 01:00:14,832
- Move!
- You killed him.

544
01:00:15,063 --> 01:00:16,164
I had no choice, now move.

545
01:00:16,443 --> 01:00:18,474
- Where's Mom?
- She's fine, she's not far.

546
01:00:18,715 --> 01:00:20,926
- Where is she?
- Come on, Kim, move!

547
01:00:22,516 --> 01:00:24,091
- I don't wanna do this.
- Go on, Kim.

548
01:00:24,321 --> 01:00:25,823
- Where are we going?
- Go straight!

549
01:00:25,853 --> 01:00:27,473
We have to go to the embassy.

550
01:00:30,064 --> 01:00:33,025
- I'm not sure I can.
- You know how to shoot?

551
01:00:33,275 --> 01:00:34,937
- No.
- Then drive.

552
01:00:42,350 --> 01:00:43,411
They escaped.

553
01:00:49,348 --> 01:00:50,698
Shit! The Cops!

554
01:00:52,299 --> 01:00:55,480
- Dad, I have to stop.
- No, I just shot one of them, now go!

555
01:01:03,684 --> 01:01:04,885
Come on, go!

556
01:01:27,629 --> 01:01:28,433
Go right!

557
01:01:33,981 --> 01:01:35,112
Back, back, back!

558
01:01:36,404 --> 01:01:37,177
Come on, move!

559
01:01:40,549 --> 01:01:41,360
Come on, Kim.

560
01:01:49,453 --> 01:01:50,905
Go! Go!

561
01:01:56,749 --> 01:01:57,966
Come on, keep going!

562
01:02:10,377 --> 01:02:11,212
Left!

563
01:02:11,578 --> 01:02:12,078
Yes.

564
01:02:18,291 --> 01:02:19,102
Keep going!

565
01:02:22,353 --> 01:02:25,003
- Oh, no, they're shooting.
- Stay low, keep going.

566
01:02:29,471 --> 01:02:31,041
- Come on, faster.
- I can't!

567
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:32,472
- Do it!
- I can't!

568
01:02:34,453 --> 01:02:36,485
Come on, move! Move!

569
01:02:37,034 --> 01:02:39,701
- Dad!
- Keep going! Watch the road!

570
01:02:41,156 --> 01:02:42,156
Right!

571
01:02:54,756 --> 01:02:55,817
Oh, shit!

572
01:03:21,613 --> 01:03:23,004
Come on, Kim, move!

573
01:03:26,865 --> 01:03:28,026
- Go! - Okay! - Go!

574
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:37,540
C'mon! Keep going!

575
01:03:40,242 --> 01:03:41,267
Come on!

576
01:03:50,081 --> 01:03:51,212
Shit!

577
01:03:52,701 --> 01:03:55,343
- Dad!
- Keep going, stay low!

578
01:04:08,353 --> 01:04:10,214
- Faster, Kim.
- I can't!

579
01:04:15,577 --> 01:04:17,037
- Come on, faster!
- Dad!

580
01:04:17,257 --> 01:04:18,058
Keep going!

581
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:23,170
You can make it!

582
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:25,541
Do it.

583
01:04:49,287 --> 01:04:52,308
- Here, Don't stop!
- But there's soldiers.

584
01:04:52,548 --> 01:04:53,499
They'll move!

585
01:04:56,223 --> 01:04:57,204
Down, Kim!

586
01:05:23,641 --> 01:05:26,792
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

587
01:05:30,195 --> 01:05:31,555
Keep your head down, Kimmy.

588
01:05:39,678 --> 01:05:40,279
Hey, Bry.

589
01:05:40,549 --> 01:05:43,700
<i>Sam, we're in the courtyard of
the U.S. embassy in Istanbul</i>

590
01:05:43,964 --> 01:05:45,225
with a smashed-up car.

591
01:05:45,675 --> 01:05:47,084
<i>Don't ask. Can you</i>

592
01:05:47,182 --> 01:05:49,087
call someone to make
sure we don't get shot?

593
01:05:49,306 --> 01:05:50,548
Yeah, of course.

594
01:05:50,549 --> 01:05:51,788
<i>Thanks.</i>

595
01:05:52,098 --> 01:05:54,239
It's Bry, he's in trouble in Istanbul.

596
01:05:56,851 --> 01:05:58,822
Mom didn't get away, did she?

597
01:06:01,272 --> 01:06:04,134
- No.
- Oh, God, Dad.

598
01:06:04,543 --> 01:06:07,296
- Tell me the truth, is she...?
- No, no, no, no, Kim.

599
01:06:07,616 --> 01:06:08,971
No, no she's not.

600
01:06:09,631 --> 01:06:12,572
But they have her.

601
01:06:12,943 --> 01:06:15,993
And they will use her until
they get what they want.

602
01:06:17,664 --> 01:06:18,595
Me!

603
01:06:20,566 --> 01:06:23,757
You'll be safe here in the
embassy until I come back.

604
01:06:24,498 --> 01:06:28,810
- Kimmy, it's gonna be okay.
- Dad, it's okay.

605
01:06:29,690 --> 01:06:31,381
Kim, Kim listen.

606
01:06:33,636 --> 01:06:35,597
I have to find them,

607
01:06:36,428 --> 01:06:37,948
and bring your mom back.

608
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:42,707
And then I have to make sure these
people never bother us again in our lives.

609
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:44,671
What are you gonna do?

610
01:06:49,103 --> 01:06:50,603
What I do best.

611
01:07:22,798 --> 01:07:24,247
Mrs. Mills.

612
01:07:25,748 --> 01:07:28,790
What should I do with you, Mrs. Mills?

613
01:07:57,157 --> 01:07:59,389
I have nothing against you.

614
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:01,519
You didn't kill my son.

615
01:08:05,801 --> 01:08:07,952
But your husband did.

616
01:08:10,574 --> 01:08:12,509
Now he betrayed you,

617
01:08:12,758 --> 01:08:16,260
by choosing to save your daughter,
instead of you.

618
01:08:17,562 --> 01:08:20,401
He left you here like a dog.

619
01:08:21,733 --> 01:08:25,445
At least my daughter is still alive.

620
01:08:37,604 --> 01:08:39,066
Mrs. Mills,

621
01:08:39,376 --> 01:08:41,106
you are a good mother,

622
01:08:42,287 --> 01:08:44,778
and a brave woman.

623
01:08:45,668 --> 01:08:48,489
For that, I'm going to send you back home...

624
01:08:49,730 --> 01:08:51,621
piece by piece.

625
01:12:18,001 --> 01:12:21,248
Boris, shut the dog up!

626
01:12:37,584 --> 01:12:38,945
Go and see what happened.

627
01:12:48,293 --> 01:12:50,894
Let's go! Move her here to the Hammond.

628
01:12:51,164 --> 01:12:52,925
Quick, quick!

629
01:14:01,109 --> 01:14:02,320
You stay here.

630
01:15:08,909 --> 01:15:10,090
Go!

631
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:12,064
Come on!

632
01:15:48,226 --> 01:15:49,406
Get lost!

633
01:16:39,638 --> 01:16:40,439
Honey?

634
01:19:07,872 --> 01:19:09,354
I'm here, Baby, I'm here.

635
01:19:09,923 --> 01:19:14,081
I'm coming back, Leny, I'm coming back.
Okay.

636
01:19:53,132 --> 01:19:54,652
What are you waiting for?

637
01:19:56,173 --> 01:20:00,545
- You have other sons?
- Two.

638
01:20:00,825 --> 01:20:05,778
And if I killed you, they will
come and seek revenge.

639
01:20:06,269 --> 01:20:08,614
They will for sure.

640
01:20:08,893 --> 01:20:10,644
And I will kill them, too.

641
01:20:11,884 --> 01:20:13,896
You can change that.

642
01:20:14,496 --> 01:20:17,548
You can go home, live your life,

643
01:20:17,888 --> 01:20:20,509
enjoy your sons, your grandsons.

644
01:20:22,079 --> 01:20:26,202
But my other son, Marko,

645
01:20:29,623 --> 01:20:31,994
the son you killed...

646
01:20:32,899 --> 01:20:35,960
am I supposed just to forget it?

647
01:20:36,210 --> 01:20:38,561
No, you'll just have to live with it,

648
01:20:39,222 --> 01:20:41,942
like the parents of all those kidnapped girls,

649
01:20:43,044 --> 01:20:46,046
or you can die... here.

650
01:20:46,295 --> 01:20:49,076
- What are you telling me?
- What I'm saying is...

651
01:20:49,876 --> 01:20:51,817
if you give me your word,

652
01:20:53,208 --> 01:20:56,560
I will throw-down this gun,
and simply walk away.

653
01:20:59,995 --> 01:21:01,556
Why?

654
01:21:01,917 --> 01:21:05,258
Because I'm tired of it all.

655
01:22:14,412 --> 01:22:16,474
Leny, I'm here.

656
01:22:17,304 --> 01:22:20,335
I'm here, baby. I'm here.
Come on.

657
01:22:26,389 --> 01:22:27,569
It's all right, Leny.

658
01:22:28,139 --> 01:22:29,540
It's okay.

659
01:22:32,821 --> 01:22:33,931
We're safe.

660
01:22:36,915 --> 01:22:37,615
Bryan?

661
01:22:39,330 --> 01:22:43,070
- Kim? Kim?
- She's safe.

662
01:22:45,250 --> 01:22:46,552
She's safe.

663
01:22:56,917 --> 01:22:58,447
We're all safe.

664
01:23:06,499 --> 01:23:06,499
Three weeks after

665
01:23:28,309 --> 01:23:30,130
Line it up!

666
01:23:31,441 --> 01:23:32,642
That's it!

667
01:23:35,182 --> 01:23:39,194
Now, begin to cut! Not too fast. Not so fast.

668
01:23:40,865 --> 01:23:43,888
Straighten it out! Straighten! Straighten!

669
01:23:47,078 --> 01:23:47,880
Stop, stop stop!

670
01:23:49,633 --> 01:23:50,503
Perfect.

671
01:24:06,691 --> 01:24:10,404
- Well... perfect score.
- Great!

672
01:24:12,194 --> 01:24:15,009
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Thank you.

673
01:24:18,851 --> 01:24:19,852
I was perfect.

674
01:24:21,733 --> 01:24:25,944
I've been saying that since the day you were born.
Congratulations!

675
01:24:27,006 --> 01:24:30,277
So... what would you like to do to celebrate?

676
01:24:32,268 --> 01:24:34,458
- I think I have an idea.
- Yeah?

677
01:24:34,758 --> 01:24:37,211
- Yeah, I'll drive.
- Of course!

678
01:24:59,234 --> 01:25:02,676
Here you go! 3 double chocolate fudge.

679
01:25:04,111 --> 01:25:06,092
- Thank you.
- And who's having the strawberry?

680
01:25:06,341 --> 01:25:07,982
I'm sorry, but I just ordered 3.

681
01:25:08,002 --> 01:25:10,183
Well, actually the order said 4.

682
01:25:10,483 --> 01:25:13,314
- I ordered a 4th one.
- Yeah? For who?

683
01:25:15,536 --> 01:25:18,107
- Oh, Jamie. Hey.
- Hey.

684
01:25:18,638 --> 01:25:21,069
- Hi.
- Hi! Pretty good timing.

685
01:25:21,169 --> 01:25:21,789
Jamie.

686
01:25:22,769 --> 01:25:25,631
- It's cool if he joins us, right?
- Of course he can, Kim.

687
01:25:25,992 --> 01:25:27,262
Dad?

688
01:25:28,396 --> 01:25:30,361
- Right?
- Of course it is, Honey.

689
01:25:30,448 --> 01:25:31,148
Behave!

690
01:25:31,197 --> 01:25:32,968
It's nice to see you again, Sir.

691
01:25:33,808 --> 01:25:35,679
Nice to see you, too. Sit down.

692
01:25:37,321 --> 01:25:37,980
Hi.

693
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:40,623
- We got you a strawberry.
- Oh, please.

694
01:25:40,642 --> 01:25:44,654
Thanks, Dad.
Do not shoot this one, I really like him.
