1
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:56,822
<i>Hey, buddy.</i>

2
00:00:56,824 --> 00:00:59,425
Space is great.
Umm...

3
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:02,661
I miss you guys.

4
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:05,064
We're a long way away now.
I can't even see, uh--

5
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:07,132
I can't even see Earth anymore.

6
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:13,138
And, uh... It's peaceful.

7
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,406
You know?

8
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:17,810
Don't tell your mom this, but I think

9
00:01:17,812 --> 00:01:19,511
I actually sleep...

10
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:21,847
Better up here, away from her snoring.

11
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:26,685
Over.

12
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:28,654
<i>Tanks B-7 and B-9 are</i>

13
00:01:28,656 --> 00:01:31,123
<i>showing early signs of freezing. Over.</i>

14
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,260
<i>What would you do if you get out there</i>

15
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,528
and you find nothing?

16
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:39,798
Well, even if we found nothing,

17
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,733
it's in effect a discovery.

18
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:44,770
It would make me very frustrated.

19
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:47,106
<i>I know there's something there.</i>

20
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:49,408
<i>Check on nav bays 3 and 4.</i>

21
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,176
<i>You might want to update...</i>

22
00:01:53,114 --> 00:01:55,814
Mission control,
repeat please. Over.

23
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:59,751
- <i>Do you want me to show you how to beat 'em?</i>
- <i>Europa One.</i>

24
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:02,788
William, I've got some static in
the comm array feed up here.

25
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,591
<i>It looks like a radiation spike.</i>

26
00:02:05,593 --> 00:02:08,627
<i>Have you tried recycling the system?</i>

27
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,762
<i>Rosa, we've lost your feed.</i>

28
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:13,832
<i>Europa One, come in.</i>

29
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:16,635
<i>Europa One.</i>

30
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,904
<i>Europa One.</i>

31
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,826
<i>These were the last images we received</i>

32
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,794
<i>from the Europa One craft.</i>

33
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:45,297
<i>At the time, it had already gone farther</i>

34
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:48,567
<i>than any human being had ever traveled before.</i>

35
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:53,438
For 16 long months I've been asked

36
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,209
the simple but loaded question:
"What happened?"

37
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:00,846
All-- I'm sorry.

38
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,739
We have to tell his family.

39
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,943
We can't.

40
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:33,612
The communication fix was never completed.

41
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:35,881
The system is fried!

42
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:38,483
Last sync with mission control was 19 hours ago.

43
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:39,985
We're all alone now.

44
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,323
So what happens?

45
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,261
Do we go on?

46
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:05,410
I was on a plane,

47
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,746
a transatlantic flight,

48
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:10,282
when the mission feed went dark.

49
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:14,419
When I landed, mission control was still saying

50
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,022
"maybe it's just
a transmission delay."

51
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,891
But, by the time I made it into mission control,

52
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:23,395
we were looking at over 15 hours of dead feed.

53
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,307
After James was lost,

54
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:36,541
the joy of the mission,

55
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:39,544
the exhilaration of it all just--

56
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:42,014
it just left.

57
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:45,984
<i>I stopped feeling like a kid on a family trip.</i>

58
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:50,956
<i>The mission has stretched on ahead of us,</i>

59
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,991
<i>somehow longer than it had been before.</i>

60
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,598
No one at home knows we're alive.

61
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,808
We're doing the right thing, right?

62
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,678
Absolutely.

63
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:25,357
<i>Andrei, have you looked out at Jupiter yet?</i>

64
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:35,033
<i>Something to be excited about.</i>

65
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:41,540
- Are you okay?
- Mmm.

66
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:45,610
You haven't said a word to me in a week.

67
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,959
- <i>I woke up one morning--</i>
- <i>okay.</i>

68
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,996
I woke up at some point and...

69
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:07,432
Didn't recognize myself.

70
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,771
<i>Objectively, I know it's the zero g</i>

71
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:15,974
<i>and the isolation that changes you.</i>

72
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:18,543
<i>But that doesn't make it any less strange.</i>

73
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:23,081
<i>It doesn't stop you from slowly breaking.</i>

74
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:40,866
<i>I started living my life</i>

75
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:44,069
in tune with the mission
that I hoped was still going on.

76
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,110
- That's good.
- Okay.

77
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:54,579
How's your appetite?

78
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,415
I'm fine.

79
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:57,916
And you're sleeping
kind of--

80
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,484
I'm not.

81
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,122
It's been a year since we lost him.

82
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,673
Tell me we can still...

83
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,840
- Good morning. I am very--

84
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:58,009
<i>We</i> are all very excited to be here today.

85
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:01,480
<i>It has certainly been a long road</i>

86
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:04,516
and all of us up here

87
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:06,718
started with the shared dream

88
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,620
of space and possibility.

89
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:12,524
And this really is
a new first-step for mankind.

90
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:14,759
From one perspective,

91
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:17,662
you can say our mission
actually began 400 years ago.

92
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,564
That's when Galileo first saw...

93
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:22,968
...Jupiter and its moons
through his telescope.

94
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,837
<i>For something this big, you get one shot.</i>

95
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,974
An unmanned mission simply wasn't
going to cut it for us.

96
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:31,543
You put men and women into space

97
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:34,179
because they have strength
in the face of cosmic odds.

98
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,047
<i>Europa One is cleared for launch.</i>

99
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,723
<i>T-minus 10,</i>

100
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:46,191
<i>nine, eight,</i>

101
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,260
<i>seven, six...</i>

102
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:50,529
- <i>...five, four...</i>
- <i>We're go for main engine.</i>

103
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:53,164
<i>...three, two, one.</i>

104
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,699
<i>Ignition.</i>

105
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,804
<i>Liftoff! On the trek to Europa.</i>

106
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:02,307
<i>Our engines at 98% thrust.</i>

107
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:04,175
<i>Fuel rate is nominal.</i>

108
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:06,878
<i>Rolling right in zero-point-six degrees.</i>

109
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,813
<i>Telemetry nominal.</i>

110
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:14,686
<i>Loft at 225 meters-per-second.</i>

111
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:17,022
<i>Altitude, 2.3 nautical Miles.</i>

112
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:19,991
<i>And in three, two, one.</i>

113
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,029
<i>We have good booster separation.</i>

114
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:25,964
Vehicle is supersonic.

115
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:27,832
Command module jettison in three,

116
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:30,669
two, one.

117
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,009
<i>We have a good shell separation.</i>

118
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:40,245
Initial burn is complete.

119
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,180
Staging in three,

120
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:44,049
two, one.

121
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:49,688
<i>Copy. We have good stage separation.</i>

122
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,590
<i>We have visual of command module.</i>

123
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,359
<i>Beginning turn for docking.</i>

124
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:58,964
<i>Trajectory is good. Thrust is good.</i>

125
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:02,233
<i>We hadn't left near-Earth orbit since 1972.</i>

126
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:05,604
Our company was tasked with moving forward

127
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:08,773
where the space programs of the 20th
century had left off.

128
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,342
- <i>10 meters to docking.</i>
- <i>I believe</i>

129
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:12,911
<i>if you have the scent of a discovery this big...</i>

130
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:16,014
- <i>Five meters.</i>
- <i>...You do not simply wait and see what happens next.</i>

131
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:17,983
<i>Contact.</i>

132
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:19,751
<i>You go after it.</i>

133
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:21,920
<i>Copy. We are green on hard dock.</i>

134
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:23,788
<i>Locks B through d are green.</i>

135
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,257
<i>Connects are stable.</i>
<i>We are green on dock.</i>

136
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:30,929
Mission control,

137
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:34,065
we are proud to report that
we are officially underway.

138
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:37,202
<i>Roger that.</i>

139
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:39,104
<i>We'll be here for you when you get back.</i>

<i>We've prepped some light traveling music for you.</i>

<i>♪ Come on in!</i>

145
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,263
Hello.

146
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:40,198
Please don't vote me off.

147
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,767
There's a camera.
What do ya know?

148
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:44,069
Reality TV.

149
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:46,071
<i>Okay, Jamie, this is your own</i>

150
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:49,007
<i>personal tour of Europa One.</i>

151
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:51,209
Oh look.
It's you, Jamie.
Hi, Jamie.

152
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,911
"Hi, dad."

153
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:55,346
Hey, Dan. You still upset
that you got the bottom bunk?

154
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:57,415
How'd you know I was thinking about that?
I really was

155
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,223
<i>"I'm so cramped."</i>
<i>Look at my spacious bunk.</i>

156
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,258
- Film me for a second.
- Okay.

157
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,463
Okay, so this is actually
one of two living quarters.

158
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:14,799
What they do is they rotate
around the core module

159
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:17,936
so this gives us simulated gravity.

160
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:19,471
But watch this.

161
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:22,107
We also get to experience

162
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:24,909
real gravity-free

163
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,078
space excitement.

164
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,813
Whoo!

165
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:30,482
And the head rush that goes with it.

166
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:33,284
- Crew meeting in one hour, guys.
- Okay.

167
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:35,820
Now the thing about zero gravity is that

168
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:38,156
<i>it makes our bones and muscles really weak.</i>

169
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:40,258
<i>This is why we spend as much time as possible</i>

170
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,193
<i>in these living modules.</i>

171
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:44,896
Yeah, okay.
Just pass it up.
I got it.

172
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:48,366
Okay. And there's
the lovely Katya.

173
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:50,502
<i>Now these are some of the science tools</i>

174
00:12:50,504 --> 00:12:53,238
<i>that we're using to test for life on Europa.</i>

175
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,440
<i>And your dad has to fix them if any of them break.</i>

176
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,975
When you're done playing tourist,

177
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:58,409
you can come over here and help me.

178
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:01,112
If you're not afraid to chip a nail.

179
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,548
<i>Now-- whoa--</i>

180
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,250
- <i>this is the cockpit.</i>

181
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:06,417
<i>Mission control...</i>

182
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:07,819
<i>...Sync.</i>

183
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:09,921
<i>Copy, Rosa. We have sync.</i>

184
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:12,524
<i>And Rosa, our pilot, used to fly jets</i>

185
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:15,093
<i>before she started flying us around.</i>

186
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:17,495
<i>And what's she doing?</i>
<i>She's setting up the camera system</i>

187
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:20,165
<i>which monitors everything that happens on the ship.</i>

188
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:22,267
<i>Smile for Jamie, Rosa.</i>

189
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:27,138
<i>And now-- last thing I want to show you--</i>

190
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,540
<i>have a look at this.</i>

191
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,810
The view.

192
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:35,446
Kind of ironic, really.

193
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,183
So little space in here

194
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:40,552
and so much space out there.

195
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:44,088
Whoa.

196
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:48,259
<i>As the ship passed the moon,</i>

197
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:50,228
<i>it had already gone farther</i>

198
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,596
<i>than any human being</i>

199
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:53,364
<i>had ever traveled before.</i>

200
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:55,300
<i>Think about that.</i>

201
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:58,336
<i>Across all of human history,</i>

202
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:02,273
<i>that moment was the farthest anyone had ever gone.</i>

203
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:05,343
<i>But they still had millions upon millions of Miles to go.</i>

204
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:08,613
<i>Our craft was heading for a moon of Jupiter</i>

205
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:10,481
<i>known as Europa.</i>

206
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:14,219
<i>This mission is riding</i>

207
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:17,255
<i>on the shoulders of many great men and women.</i>

208
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:19,257
<i>And so if we have any legacy at all,</i>

209
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:21,359
<i>I would hope that it would be</i>

210
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:24,462
that we would inspire those who come after us

211
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:25,630
to keep exploring,

212
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:28,399
to keep pushing the boundaries,

213
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:30,869
to keep looking for the answers

214
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:32,904
to those
really tough questions--

215
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:34,038
who are we?

216
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,306
Why are we here?

217
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:36,507
Where do we come from?

218
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:39,344
And... are we alone?

219
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,414
<i>For a very long time,</i>

220
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:46,651
Europa has seemed to be just
a solid sphere of ice.

221
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:48,987
But even just looking at its surface,

222
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:50,889
there are clues, you know?

223
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:53,424
There might be water underneath the ice.

224
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:55,093
And then in the fall of 2011,

225
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:57,629
scientists realized--
they released data

226
00:14:57,631 --> 00:15:00,632
showing the presence
of sub-surface lakes--

227
00:15:00,634 --> 00:15:04,235
of liquid!
And-- wow!

228
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,271
- <i>Wherever we have found water--</i>

229
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:08,006
we have found life.

230
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:10,642
But what came next was, um...

231
00:15:10,644 --> 00:15:12,377
Even more startling.

232
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:14,579
NASA discovered heat signatures

233
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:18,283
under an area known as the conamara chaos.

234
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:19,951
<i>Well, they teased the idea that--</i>

235
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:22,420
<i>that simple mono-cellular life</i>

236
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:26,624
in our solar system might not just be possible,

237
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:28,059
it might be probable.

238
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:30,662
I wanna go to Europa and go ice fishing.

239
00:15:30,664 --> 00:15:32,664
Cut through the ice, lower a submersible,

240
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,365
look around, see what's there.

241
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:37,602
See what swims up to the camera lens and licks it.

242
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:40,371
If life exists on Europa,

243
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:43,308
it will be the single most profound

244
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,710
discovery in human history.

245
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:53,251
Dasque to mission control.
Over.

246
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:56,587
<i>We read you, Rosa. Over.</i>

247
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:58,056
<i>Data sync is live.</i>

248
00:15:58,058 --> 00:15:59,991
<i>How's everyone holding up?</i>

249
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:01,359
I think it's potato soup.

250
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:03,227
- Get something to drink.
- Dude, why--

251
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:05,964
why would you put garlic into a space dish?

252
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:08,499
It's very rich.

253
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:10,468
- It's delicious.
- I have to say, though...

254
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:17,475
Okay, look look--
I've got another mile to go.

255
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,644
Not bad, eh?

256
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,980
What about after your run?

257
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:23,681
When are you gonna actually call someone?

258
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:26,284
None of your business.

259
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:30,488
Hey. It's time.

260
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,557
I should have learned mandarin before we left.

261
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,359
- He's probably talking about me.
- Gun it.

262
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:36,561
One, two, one, two, one, two, one...

263
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,603
- <i>How did you feel?</i>
- <i>I said yes</i>

264
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:47,171
<i>before the question even sunk in.</i>

265
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:52,543
<i>They had to ask me four times</i>
<i>before I could even respond.</i>

266
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:56,714
<i>No trouble on the ping requests.</i>

267
00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:59,484
<i>We see a sticking valve in v-tech.</i>

268
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:03,321
<i>Andrei is already working on a fix.</i>

269
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:06,257
If it leaks anymore, we'll isolate the manifold.

270
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:11,262
Oh, and we have a series

271
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:13,031
of fuse events in Rosa's station.

272
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:15,767
Can you have the team on duty investigate? Over.

273
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:19,704
<i>Copy that. But you might have it fixed</i>

274
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:21,305
<i>before we finish the review.</i>

275
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:23,274
<i>You're making us feel two steps behind.</i>

276
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:24,776
<i>Over.</i>

277
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:27,678
<i>You'll make him blush. Over.</i>

278
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,061
Mission control, can you hear me?

279
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,630
Andrei is in the shower right now,

280
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:47,365
so I want to take this opportunity

281
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:50,334
to tell you that your shower
system is totally inadequate.

282
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,070
And I don't buy your theories about

283
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:53,638
the body adjusting to the new hygiene regime.

284
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,273
You know what I can't adjust to?

285
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:57,341
The drinking of the distilled urine.

286
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:59,544
Oh! James!

287
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:00,745
I'm just saying--

288
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,280
you're worried about my smell

289
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:03,815
and you're drinking my urine?

290
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:06,584
You know what I think
they're really pissed off about?

291
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,820
You guys only gave them four outfits.

292
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:10,755
So sometimes they wake up in the morning,

293
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:13,758
they find out they're wearing
the same thing the entire day.

294
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,194
They get totally pissed off.

295
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:17,829
- And the shoes--

296
00:18:17,831 --> 00:18:19,764
You gave them two pairs of shoes

297
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:22,700
for women.
I'm just saying.

298
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:24,869
<i>Rosa, dinner!</i>
<i>Where is she?</i>

299
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:26,838
- <i>Coming.</i>
- <i>Who's the lasagna?</i>

300
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,673
- Yeah.
- <i>That's you?</i>

301
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:31,209
- <i>Oh God.</i>
- <i>Who's the pod macaroni and cheese. Ish?</i>

302
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:33,578
- I guess I'll take that.
- To six months!

303
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,682
- Okay, eyes. Eyes.
- Wait, you're not looking into my eyes.

304
00:18:37,684 --> 00:18:38,850
Oh, sorry.

305
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:43,821
- Can I see?
- Did you see any polar bears?

306
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:46,457
No, really.

307
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:54,499
We pooled our astronauts

308
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:58,169
from the very best space programs across the globe.

309
00:18:58,171 --> 00:19:00,838
Our captain is William xu.

310
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,573
I think this mission will show people that

311
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:05,243
we're still capable
of achieving impossible things.

312
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:06,811
<i>Dr. Daniel Luxembourg.</i>

313
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,479
My entire adult life has been dedicated

314
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,248
to exploring extreme environments.

315
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,383
I became an astronaut specifically

316
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:13,918
to have the opportunity
to do something like this.

317
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,553
<i>Dr. Katya petrovna.</i>

318
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:18,489
Life on Earth began in the ocean,
so in some ways

319
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,625
this mission will be like
taking a trip back in time.

320
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:23,895
My background is in marine
biology and oceanography.

321
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:27,865
To be honest, sometimes I'm terrified of flying.

322
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:29,367
<i>Andrei blok.</i>

323
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:33,671
I think I have 349 days in outer space,

324
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,840
so I'm what you call a veteran.

325
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:38,409
The only thing I can't face is...

326
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:43,181
The food.

327
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:44,382
<i>James corrigan.</i>

328
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:46,951
I remember watching footage at school

329
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:49,353
of Neil Armstrong on the moon,

330
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:52,723
and just-- just knowing
"I want to do this."

331
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:56,194
- <i>Rosa dasque.</i>
- <i>Call me immature, reckless, arrogant.</i>

332
00:19:56,196 --> 00:20:00,331
I just want to go faster and
farther than anyone has before.

333
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:04,202
We had to design a spacecraft
unlike by any before it.

334
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:07,972
Of course, once the decision
was made to put people onboard,

335
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:09,840
the requirements ballooned.

336
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:12,843
Human beings need food, shelter.

337
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:15,713
They need an environment that is survivable

338
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,915
and has some level of comfort.

339
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:23,221
<i>It's cracking the ice.</i>

340
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,874
<i>We're a month away, Andrei.</i>

341
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:46,744
<i>We're still concerned about your recovery.</i>

342
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:56,887
So how should I be recovering, exactly?

343
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:09,333
Excuse me.

344
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:24,982
So what do you think?

345
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,290
I still wouldn't advise leaving him
in the orbiter alone for three weeks.

346
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:35,326
I'd rather not leave our only engineer behind.

347
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:40,331
So we take him down with us then.

348
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:43,868
Yeah.

349
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,805
<i>Jupiter.</i>

350
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:50,875
<i>Being so close to our destination lifted our spirits.</i>

351
00:21:50,877 --> 00:21:53,444
<i>It felt that everything made sense again.</i>

352
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:56,947
The thickness in the air cleared.

353
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:02,353
But what cleared it was sheer adrenaline.

354
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:07,525
<i>Prep for orbital transfer.</i>

355
00:22:07,527 --> 00:22:09,327
<i>We're gonna feel some gs here.</i>

356
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:00,444
<i>Pitch maneuver.</i>

357
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:03,414
<i>We are clear of Jupiter's orbit.</i>

358
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:05,015
<i>Beginning orbital transfer.</i>

359
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:08,486
<i>Pitching for power descent.</i>

360
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:15,993
<i>Daniel, can you keep Andrei abreast</i>

361
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:17,895
<i>of any of those changes in the readouts, please?</i>

362
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:20,498
- <i>Roger that.</i>
- <i>Orbit trajectory, clear.</i>

363
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,167
<i>Current speed 60 kilometers per second.</i>

364
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:26,704
- <i>Ready?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

365
00:23:26,706 --> 00:23:29,039
<i>Surface conditions in the L.Z.?</i>

366
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:31,542
I've got heat plume and
radiation analysis incoming,

367
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:34,412
but the data is variable.
Heat is fluctuating.

368
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:35,813
<i>Not far now.</i>

369
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,950
<i>All systems online.</i>

370
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:41,585
<i>Showing green light.</i>

371
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:46,424
<i>Landing gear armed and ready to deploy.</i>

372
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:49,760
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, hold on.</i>

373
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:50,995
<i>Here we go.</i>

374
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:53,998
<i>Trajectory and speed?</i>

375
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,534
<i>Heading 270.3.</i>

376
00:23:56,536 --> 00:23:58,102
<i>Coming in low across thera macula</i>

377
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:01,572
<i>at 458.4 meters per second.</i>

378
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,175
<i>Target site lining up.</i>

379
00:24:04,177 --> 00:24:06,577
<i>Landing gear deployed.</i>

380
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:08,112
<i>20 seconds to--</i>

381
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:13,651
It's like a thermal vent.
Sort of an eruptive feature.

382
00:24:13,653 --> 00:24:15,186
- Can you stabilize us?
- I'm trying!

383
00:24:15,188 --> 00:24:17,121
Andrei, I need an option for emergency landing.

384
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:19,490
<i>Vent's coming from the area around our target site.</i>

385
00:24:19,492 --> 00:24:22,560
There's a low gradation of ice just
past the L.Z., along thrace macula.

386
00:24:22,562 --> 00:24:24,695
Okay. Land us long.
Get us past the vent area.

387
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:28,532
- <i>100 meters to contact</i>
- <i>10 seconds of fuel.</i>

388
00:24:28,534 --> 00:24:29,767
Back off the burners on approach

389
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:31,068
or we'll melt our landing site.

390
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,903
<i>Roger that. 10 meters.</i>

391
00:24:32,905 --> 00:24:34,605
- <i>Five meters.</i>
- <i>Contact lights.</i>

392
00:24:34,607 --> 00:24:35,773
<i>Shut down.</i>

393
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:37,908
I think we've got it.

394
00:25:30,897 --> 00:25:32,796
Everything okay up here?

395
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:34,532
Sorry.

396
00:25:34,534 --> 00:25:36,133
I can't pull my eyes away from it.

397
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:40,738
It takes your breath away.

398
00:25:49,315 --> 00:25:51,749
That night I went out

399
00:25:51,751 --> 00:25:54,919
and found Jupiter in the night sky and...

400
00:25:54,921 --> 00:25:57,721
I spent a long time looking at it, just...

401
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:59,223
Hoping.

402
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:13,737
<i>Surface temp in current position</i>

403
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:15,306
is holding at absolute zero.

404
00:26:15,308 --> 00:26:18,943
Prelim service data has us on
a bed of what looks like ice 11.

405
00:26:18,945 --> 00:26:23,581
We should be there, but we're here.

406
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:26,350
We flew 590 million kilometers

407
00:26:26,352 --> 00:26:28,886
and then landed 100 meters off the mark.

408
00:26:28,888 --> 00:26:30,788
<i>It seems insignificant,</i>

409
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:33,223
but it will be difficult
to get useful surface analysis.

410
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:36,727
<i>Ironically, what threw the ship off</i>
<i>course from the original target zone</i>

411
00:26:36,729 --> 00:26:39,630
was a reconfirmation of what we had hoped for.

412
00:26:39,632 --> 00:26:43,267
<i>If such heat-plume eruptions were</i>
<i>escaping through the cracks in the ice,</i>

413
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:46,770
<i>it suggested strong underwater thermal</i>
<i>activity and the potential for life.</i>

414
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:49,373
<i>If they had landed on the target area</i>

415
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:52,076
<i>which was ripe for surface analysis,</i>

416
00:26:52,078 --> 00:26:54,812
<i>the mission would have begun</i>
<i>with extensive surface tests</i>

417
00:26:54,814 --> 00:26:56,714
<i>using the ship's robotic arm</i>

418
00:26:56,716 --> 00:26:59,149
<i>followed by a few hours</i>
<i>of drilling through the ice</i>

419
00:26:59,151 --> 00:27:01,118
<i>to deploy a remote underwater probe.</i>

420
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,722
So how will that affect procedure?

421
00:27:04,724 --> 00:27:07,224
What it means is we won't get
the data we want very easily.

422
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:09,326
That's why I want to move back
Daniel's surface test

423
00:27:09,328 --> 00:27:10,794
and start the drill immediately.

424
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:13,831
Our best hopes of success lies under the ice.

425
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:15,733
Daniel, what do you think?

426
00:27:15,735 --> 00:27:18,335
- I wanna argue...
- I'm sure you would.

427
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:20,270
...But with our current position in the ice,

428
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:22,773
we won't get key data.

429
00:27:22,775 --> 00:27:24,808
Let's go for a swim.

430
00:27:38,391 --> 00:27:40,791
<i>Drill head is locked and prepped.</i>

431
00:27:40,793 --> 00:27:43,060
Beginning extension.

432
00:27:43,062 --> 00:27:45,062
Thermal is live.

433
00:27:47,133 --> 00:27:49,166
Entering ice layer now.

434
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,053
- <i>Do you hear that?</i>
- <i>Uh-huh.</i>

435
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:18,762
- Are you getting it?
- Yeah.

436
00:28:18,764 --> 00:28:20,698
I think that's just the ice shifting.

437
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:25,035
We can expect more of that
as the temperature drops.

438
00:28:58,437 --> 00:29:00,471
<i>That was stronger than our data projected it.</i>

439
00:29:00,473 --> 00:29:03,307
- <i>Are we stable?</i>
- <i>Re-working the analysis now.</i>

440
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,411
Katya, let's try the frequency of these quakes.

441
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:09,379
Increased Tidal activity means

442
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:12,282
<i>there could be more heat than we</i>
<i>thought beneath the surface.</i>

443
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,488
- You're recording this?
- Yeah.

444
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,264
Okay, let's run some diagnostics here,

445
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:29,099
because it seems to be escalating a little bit.

446
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:36,940
<i>Might be some subsurface aftershocks...</i>

447
00:29:45,151 --> 00:29:47,284
You saw it.

448
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:05,502
You got to check out this activity.

449
00:30:05,504 --> 00:30:07,437
- It's incredible.
- Everything's fine here.

450
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:08,572
What about the E.C.S.?

451
00:30:10,576 --> 00:30:14,077
- How about the hull and landing gear?
- You see this?

452
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:15,979
- Check out the activity. Incredible.
- Yeah, no deflection.

453
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:19,449
- E.C.S.?
- <i>E.C.S. Okay.</i>

454
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:21,185
<i>No problems here.</i>

455
00:30:21,187 --> 00:30:23,954
Guys, I saw something.

456
00:30:23,956 --> 00:30:25,823
<i>What do you mean?</i>

457
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:29,092
Uh, umm...

458
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:32,529
I saw something outside the ship.

459
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:34,565
From up there, through the porthole.

460
00:30:34,567 --> 00:30:36,834
<i>Maybe 100 meters out.</i>

461
00:30:36,836 --> 00:30:39,603
<i>I tried to get a video, but I missed it.</i>

462
00:30:39,605 --> 00:30:42,372
It was a light down the linea.

463
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:45,242
I was working one of the
servers when the ice shook.

464
00:30:45,244 --> 00:30:47,377
<i>And... it was there.</i>

465
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:51,081
- A light source outside the ship?
- I know that I saw it.

466
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:53,550
- It was flickering.
- How strong was the light?

467
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:55,185
Well...

468
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:56,887
It was like an l.E.D.,

469
00:30:56,889 --> 00:30:58,589
but dull from refraction.

470
00:30:58,591 --> 00:31:01,491
But the--
oh, it happened so fast.

471
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:03,060
It was there and then it was gone.

472
00:31:03,062 --> 00:31:04,261
You mean it moved?

473
00:31:04,263 --> 00:31:07,197
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, it moved.

474
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:09,633
I can check the heat signatures.

475
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:24,248
<i>Do you see anything?</i>

476
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:27,584
<i>I've checked this footage three times.</i>

477
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:29,219
- <i>There's nothing to see.</i>
- <i>Yeah,</i>

478
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:31,088
but that doesn't mean there was nothing there.

479
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:33,590
If it was too dim, these cameras
wouldn't have caught it.

480
00:31:33,592 --> 00:31:36,493
<i>That's true. A weak chemiluminescence maybe?</i>

481
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:39,263
Triggered by shifts in the ice?

482
00:31:39,265 --> 00:31:41,665
A chemical iridescence doesn't fit this description.

483
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:44,902
Maybe. When we prepare the surface test, we'll know.

484
00:31:44,904 --> 00:31:48,505
I find the idea of bacteria clinging to
the underside of the ice more likely.

485
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:52,009
Something that has a luminescent
response to radioactivity.

486
00:31:52,011 --> 00:31:54,044
Yeah, but do you think it actually moved?

487
00:31:54,046 --> 00:31:55,913
Scientifically I doubt it.

488
00:31:55,915 --> 00:32:00,083
<i>Wait, did you notice that?</i>

489
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:01,985
<i>What?</i>

490
00:32:04,123 --> 00:32:07,224
<i>Radiation interference.</i>

491
00:32:07,226 --> 00:32:09,092
<i>It's on all the cameras.</i>

492
00:32:13,565 --> 00:32:17,567
I think there's another version
of this that we have to consider.

493
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:19,569
It's entirely possible Andrei
didn't see anything at all.

494
00:32:19,571 --> 00:32:23,440
It's very dark out there and his mind
could be filling in the blanks.

495
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:26,043
But it could also be our first indication

496
00:32:26,045 --> 00:32:28,178
of exactly what we came out here to find.

497
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:38,355
- Is Andrei sleeping yet?
- No.

498
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:55,072
<i>In those days there was a raw--</i>

499
00:32:55,074 --> 00:32:57,240
<i>a raw mix of emotions.</i>

500
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,677
<i>We'd come so far, weathered so much.</i>

501
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:08,485
I think we were all in a place

502
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:11,989
where excitement blended with awe...

503
00:33:11,991 --> 00:33:13,423
<i>And fear.</i>

504
00:33:39,151 --> 00:33:40,650
<i>Okay, so Daniel is my witness.</i>

505
00:33:40,652 --> 00:33:43,553
You find a single microbe up there and I win.

506
00:33:43,555 --> 00:33:46,757
If you find a still-living microbe, you win.

507
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:49,793
What? Evidence of extinction
doesn't win me the bet?

508
00:33:49,795 --> 00:33:52,662
You always find a technicality like that

509
00:33:52,664 --> 00:33:55,699
- for winning.
- No no no. It's not a technicality.

510
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:58,068
It means that at some point
in time we were not alone.

511
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:00,270
It is a technicality.

512
00:34:00,272 --> 00:34:01,671
- Daniel.
- What?

513
00:34:01,673 --> 00:34:03,306
What are you doing, buddy?
What's happening?

514
00:34:03,308 --> 00:34:04,674
- You lost something?
- I lost my toothbrush.

515
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:06,810
- What?
- He's unpacking his entire bunk.

516
00:34:06,812 --> 00:34:12,449
- We have to return to Earth.
- We better call housekeeping.

517
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:16,820
<i>You should get some rest.</i>

518
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:22,759
Not until I know what I saw out there.

519
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:24,728
We're working on it.

520
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,797
<i>We'll figure it out.</i>

521
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:32,636
What if I can't believe or trust my own eyes?

522
00:34:37,142 --> 00:34:38,775
You need to sleep.

523
00:34:38,777 --> 00:34:40,844
We need you to sleep.

524
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:44,281
<i>There's pills, sedatives.</i>

525
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,818
<i>No pills.</i>

526
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:50,787
<i>I need to stay alert.</i>
<i>I need to stay focused.</i>

527
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:10,774
<i>How are you holding up?</i>

528
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:12,109
Good.

529
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:22,886
<i>We've broken through.</i>

530
00:35:22,888 --> 00:35:24,688
Water.

531
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:37,801
Probe microphone live.

532
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:55,285
<i>Wow. This is a completely untouched environment.</i>

533
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,888
<i>Just waiting.</i>

534
00:36:00,292 --> 00:36:02,526
Hmm.

535
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,604
We're so far from home, but...

536
00:36:14,606 --> 00:36:17,207
It's like looking at lake vostok right now.

537
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:26,383
Radiation levels down here are minimal.

538
00:36:26,385 --> 00:36:29,786
And there's definitely a heat source
somewhere in our target zone.

539
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:39,663
122 meters
to heat-plume area.

540
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:43,466
There's 100 kilometers of water down there.

541
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:45,902
It puts the trench zones back on Earth to shame.

542
00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:48,238
I think we're seeing some tectonic plates here.

543
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,340
The sulfur concentration is showing

544
00:36:50,342 --> 00:36:52,976
that the thermal vents are closer than expected.

545
00:36:52,978 --> 00:36:55,579
Creepy.

546
00:36:55,581 --> 00:36:57,514
That's your scientific assessment, is it?

547
00:36:57,516 --> 00:36:58,982
- Yep.
- "Creepy"?

548
00:36:58,984 --> 00:37:00,984
Is that the weathering of the ice?

549
00:37:00,986 --> 00:37:02,986
<i>Maybe.</i>

550
00:37:02,988 --> 00:37:04,988
Could be a bacteria.

551
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:08,692
<i>Grabbing samples</i>

552
00:37:08,694 --> 00:37:11,761
<i>and... moving on.</i>

553
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:13,964
<i>20 meters to target zone.</i>

554
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:20,704
<i>Look at how the sunlight penetrates the ice here.</i>

555
00:37:20,706 --> 00:37:22,672
It must be much thinner than we thought.

556
00:37:25,544 --> 00:37:26,843
You hear that?

557
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:31,314
It could be coming from reverberations,

558
00:37:31,316 --> 00:37:33,850
deeper caverns caught in currents.

559
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:35,385
It's almost like a male whale sound.

560
00:37:35,387 --> 00:37:37,621
Hey, a little presumptuous, don't you think?

561
00:37:37,623 --> 00:37:40,357
- Maybe.
- Oh yeah.

562
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:42,692
<i>I've got some irregularities in our data here.</i>

563
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:44,628
I'm getting a radiation spike.

564
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,596
Rosa, are you picking up on this?

565
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:48,865
<i>There's something in the video feed too.</i>

566
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:51,468
<i>It's similar to what we saw</i>
<i>after the last ice shift.</i>

567
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,572
That doesn't make any sense.

568
00:37:55,574 --> 00:37:57,907
The ice should be shielding
the probe from radiation.

569
00:37:57,909 --> 00:37:59,743
<i>It's not coming from above.</i>

570
00:37:59,745 --> 00:38:01,911
It's coming from deeper into the target zone.

571
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:03,580
Yeah.

572
00:38:03,582 --> 00:38:05,949
Let's adjust course and depth to investigate.

573
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:07,450
Bringing us down.

574
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:16,559
<i>What was that?</i>

575
00:38:16,561 --> 00:38:18,328
What's our temperature down here?

576
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:29,039
<i>Get ready to expand the probe arm</i>

577
00:38:29,041 --> 00:38:31,541
<i>to get samples.</i>

578
00:38:31,543 --> 00:38:35,312
What was that?
Oh shit.

579
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:41,318
<i>Cycle power.</i>

580
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,653
All right, let's run some tests.

581
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:44,988
<i>There was an abnormal shift</i>

582
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,756
<i>in the velocity of the current.</i>

583
00:38:46,758 --> 00:38:48,958
- <i>It's not reacting.</i>
- <i>Is it a remote issue?</i>

584
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,861
- I've lost control of it.
- Shit.

585
00:38:53,632 --> 00:38:54,898
Can you play back the video?

586
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:13,116
<i>Did something hit the probe?</i>

587
00:39:13,118 --> 00:39:15,118
- <i>What data do we have?</i>
- <i>It'll take time to process,</i>

588
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,088
but I'll tell you right now, not much.

589
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:20,123
<i>It seemed like it was right under the probe.</i>

590
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:22,525
<i>What was the last bits of data it saved?</i>

591
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,627
The heat surged 50°,

592
00:39:24,629 --> 00:39:26,996
but that couldn't have caused a critical...

593
00:39:26,998 --> 00:39:28,398
<i>Shit!</i>

594
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:39,909
<i>A surface walk was always heavily debated</i>

595
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:42,379
<i>at all stages of our mission planning.</i>

596
00:39:42,381 --> 00:39:46,383
And our main concern then
was the radiation from Jupiter.

597
00:39:46,385 --> 00:39:48,518
I will walk to the target zone

598
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,388
and I'll get the body of samples we need.

599
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,856
Katya, the radiation alone--

600
00:39:52,858 --> 00:39:54,657
the radiation is fluctuating.

601
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:56,393
It was 200 ram last time I checked.

602
00:39:56,395 --> 00:39:58,128
I'm willing to take that risk.

603
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:01,064
- What about everything else that could go wrong?
- It's 100 meters!

604
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:03,133
<i>Having lost the probe, the only way to get the data</i>

605
00:40:03,135 --> 00:40:05,034
was to explore the chaos zones

606
00:40:05,036 --> 00:40:08,037
where the ice had cracked
and re-cracked.

607
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:12,542
And this process would expose any microorganisms

608
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:14,411
that have been trapped inside the ice.

609
00:40:14,413 --> 00:40:16,012
Somebody's gotta go out there!

610
00:40:16,014 --> 00:40:19,816
- It's too risky.
- Enough! Enough!

611
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:28,057
I feel like it's a critical
phase and I'm not there.

612
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:30,059
- I just--

613
00:40:30,061 --> 00:40:32,529
I just didn't realize it would be this hard.

614
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,733
Over.

615
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,971
Sounds like a car.

616
00:40:45,977 --> 00:40:48,711
You know take him to the game, if you want.

617
00:40:48,713 --> 00:40:49,946
Umm...

618
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:55,185
I miss you guys.
Love you.

619
00:40:55,187 --> 00:40:56,920
Over.

620
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:01,958
You okay?

621
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,461
Yeah, I am good.

622
00:41:04,463 --> 00:41:06,696
I'm good.

623
00:41:06,698 --> 00:41:08,531
Not so easy, is it?

624
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,634
No.

625
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:12,869
No, it's not.

626
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:20,210
You know, my boy's gonna be
six when I see him again.

627
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:24,848
<i>He's gonna be proud of you.</i>

628
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,588
What would you do

629
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,122
if you get out there and you find nothing?

630
00:41:34,526 --> 00:41:36,092
Well, even if we found nothing,

631
00:41:36,094 --> 00:41:37,994
it's in effect a discovery.

632
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:40,964
It would make me very frustrated.

633
00:41:40,966 --> 00:41:43,233
I know there's something there.

634
00:41:43,235 --> 00:41:45,535
<i>Check on nav bays 3 and 4.</i>

635
00:41:48,273 --> 00:41:50,507
Mission control,
repeat please. Over.

636
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:54,644
<i>William, I've got some static</i>
<i>in the comm array feed up here.</i>

637
00:41:54,646 --> 00:41:56,279
<i>It looks like a radiation spike.</i>

638
00:41:56,281 --> 00:41:58,848
Have you tried recycling the system?

639
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:02,785
<i>Rosa, we've lost your feed.</i>

640
00:42:02,787 --> 00:42:04,187
<i>Come in, Europa One.</i>

641
00:42:04,189 --> 00:42:06,856
<i>Europa One, come in.</i>

642
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:08,791
<i>Come in, Europa One.</i>

643
00:42:08,793 --> 00:42:11,027
<i>Europa One, come in.</i>

644
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,230
<i>Europa One.</i>

645
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:37,287
<i>Europa One, Europa One, do you--</i>

646
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:44,227
<i>Now try as you might to prepare for everything,</i>

647
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:46,796
<i>there will always be that unknown element.</i>

648
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,668
<i>In this case a solar storm hit,</i>

649
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:55,171
<i>damaging key systems, including</i>
<i>communication with mission control.</i>

650
00:43:00,011 --> 00:43:03,346
Okay. Oxygen is flowing.
We're good.

651
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,824
This never gets old.

652
00:43:16,328 --> 00:43:18,595
Okay, commencing egress.

653
00:43:20,665 --> 00:43:22,332
<i>William, I'm gonna tether the emus</i>

654
00:43:22,334 --> 00:43:24,867

<i>On the hull.</i>

655
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:26,669
<i>Roger that.</i>

656
00:43:26,671 --> 00:43:28,838
<i>Andrei and James had to do</i>

657
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,940
<i>an e.V.A.</i>
<i>To repair the system--</i>

658
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:34,010
<i>a bit like performing ballet</i>
<i>and rocket science</i>

659
00:43:34,012 --> 00:43:36,279
<i>at 125,000 Miles an hour.</i>

660
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:40,249
This reminds me of the iss thrust fix all over again.

661
00:43:40,251 --> 00:43:43,353
<i>5 hours, 13 minutes remaining on Eva.</i>

662
00:43:43,355 --> 00:43:46,723
You know what time it is back on Earth?

663
00:43:46,725 --> 00:43:50,093
Battery block D is non-functional.

664
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:54,297
<i>2 hours 55 minutes.</i>

665
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:57,734
All right, I've got green lights
on the fan arrays.

666
00:43:57,736 --> 00:43:59,736
How are we doing on the comm power supply?

667
00:43:59,738 --> 00:44:01,304
So I said to the guy, "you know,

668
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:03,406
I can't just come along
and stay as long as you want.

669
00:44:03,408 --> 00:44:05,274
You have to tell me
how long it's gonna take."

670
00:44:05,276 --> 00:44:08,111
Okay, guys, 50 minutes remaining on Eva.

671
00:44:08,113 --> 00:44:10,413
I can't keep you out there much longer.

672
00:44:10,415 --> 00:44:13,016
<i>Panels one through six are clear.</i>

673
00:44:13,018 --> 00:44:14,851
<i>Moving onto seven.</i>

674
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:18,221
<i>We just need a little more time, William.</i>

675
00:44:18,223 --> 00:44:20,757
<i>I think it's a blown fuse</i>
<i>in the communication panel.</i>

676
00:44:20,759 --> 00:44:22,358
<i>You've got 37 minutes.</i>

677
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,161
<i>If you don't find it,</i>
<i>we'll need to begin regress.</i>

678
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:27,864
<i>Okay we're at the communication panel.</i>

679
00:44:27,866 --> 00:44:29,799
Opening up the door.

680
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,438
What do you got, Andrei?

681
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,306
James, get a look at this.

682
00:44:37,308 --> 00:44:38,941
Whoo.

683
00:44:38,943 --> 00:44:40,410
The receptors are shot.

684
00:44:40,412 --> 00:44:43,780
Yeah, William, the whole board is fried.

685
00:44:43,782 --> 00:44:45,181
I gotta take the pins out.

686
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,383
Okay.

687
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:52,155
Taking out the first pin.

688
00:44:52,157 --> 00:44:54,857
<i>Come on.</i>

689
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:56,259
And first pin is clear.

690
00:44:56,261 --> 00:44:58,194
Going for number two.

691
00:44:58,196 --> 00:45:00,329
<i>Proceed.</i>

692
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:02,932
Come on.

693
00:45:02,934 --> 00:45:04,834
Shit.

694
00:45:04,836 --> 00:45:06,269
It's not coming.

695
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:10,807
Okay. William,
we've got a frozen pin.

696
00:45:10,809 --> 00:45:13,376
<i>Okay, guys, leave that last panel for now.</i>

697
00:45:13,378 --> 00:45:15,344
What do you think?

698
00:45:15,346 --> 00:45:18,448
We can't tell how bad it is till we get in there.

699
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:22,351
You sure, man?
You don't want to put heat on there first?

700
00:45:22,353 --> 00:45:24,253
- It just feels--
- the damage could spread.

701
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:30,426
- <i>Okay.</i>
- <i>What the hell is going on out there?</i>

702
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,364
Okay. I'm set.

703
00:45:35,366 --> 00:45:37,166
Come on.

704
00:45:37,168 --> 00:45:39,502
Ah! Shit!
It snapped.

705
00:45:39,504 --> 00:45:41,904
The panel snapped.

706
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:44,841
I ripped my glove.

707
00:45:44,843 --> 00:45:45,942
I ripped--

708
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:49,011
<i>It's okay. Andrei's okay.</i>

709
00:45:49,013 --> 00:45:50,480
- <i>We're tethered.</i>
- <i>It's a tear of one inch.</i>

710
00:45:50,482 --> 00:45:52,014
- I've cut my skin.
- I got him hooked to me.

711
00:45:52,016 --> 00:45:55,518
Andrei, do not attempt
to climb back in on your own.

712
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,019
- James?
- <i>I see him, I see him.</i>

713
00:45:57,021 --> 00:45:59,522
I got him.
I'm going for him. Hang on.

714
00:45:59,524 --> 00:46:01,257
- It's a small rip.
- Take it easy.

715
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:03,526
- Just relax big guy.
- <i>Keep calm, Andrei.</i>

716
00:46:03,528 --> 00:46:05,294
- I'm bleeding.
- <i>Save your oxygen.</i>

717
00:46:05,296 --> 00:46:08,464
He's losing air, but he's got his hand on it.

718
00:46:08,466 --> 00:46:11,434
<i>I got you.</i>

719
00:46:11,436 --> 00:46:14,837
- I got you.
- Oxygen pressure is dropping steadily.

720
00:46:14,839 --> 00:46:16,939
You don't have much time.

721
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:26,849
<i>James, listen to me.</i>

722
00:46:26,851 --> 00:46:28,551
<i>His oxygen level is red-lighting.</i>

723
00:46:28,553 --> 00:46:30,787
Get him back inside the ship.

724
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:32,789
Okay.

725
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:38,127
We're at the lock.
I'm coming in.

726
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:39,495
Stop, don't go in.

727
00:46:39,497 --> 00:46:43,499
- Why?
- There's something on your suit.

728
00:46:43,501 --> 00:46:45,434
It's hydrazine.

729
00:46:45,436 --> 00:46:48,871
Uh, guys, we've got a problem.

730
00:46:48,873 --> 00:46:50,540
I've got hydrazine on my suit.

731
00:46:50,542 --> 00:46:53,242
It must have hit me when we popped the panel.

732
00:46:53,244 --> 00:46:54,443
He's covered in it.

733
00:46:54,445 --> 00:46:56,579
It's in the seams.
It's-- it's everywhere.

734
00:46:56,581 --> 00:46:59,949
- What can we do to decontaminate?
- We can't.

735
00:46:59,951 --> 00:47:02,819
If we bring him in, the air on
the ship will become toxic.

736
00:47:02,821 --> 00:47:05,087
Come on.
Shit.

737
00:47:05,089 --> 00:47:06,956
We should get him in the lock,
get a V-cam reading.

738
00:47:06,958 --> 00:47:09,358
We can't.
There'd be too much risk of lingering contamination.

739
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,494
We gotta figure out a way to get the suit clean.

740
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:13,196
It's not coming out.

741
00:47:13,198 --> 00:47:14,463
I'm totally screwed.

742
00:47:14,465 --> 00:47:15,965
<i>Andrei, get in the lock.</i>

743
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:17,366
<i>We need to depressurize your suit now.</i>

744
00:47:17,368 --> 00:47:18,968
<i>Then we'll figure out how to get James in.</i>

745
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:20,436
Seriously?!

746
00:47:20,438 --> 00:47:21,470
Come on, man, I got--

747
00:47:21,472 --> 00:47:23,339
I've got 20 minutes of oxygen.

748
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:25,308
<i>Is there no way to get it clean?</i>

749
00:47:27,979 --> 00:47:30,446
- Andrei.
- I'm not going in.

750
00:47:30,448 --> 00:47:31,981
I'll get you out of the suit...

751
00:47:31,983 --> 00:47:33,950
- What?
- <i>...Into the airlock.</i>

752
00:47:33,952 --> 00:47:35,852
You'll be out of the suit less than two minutes.

753
00:47:35,854 --> 00:47:38,120
- It's survivable.
- <i>Is that even possible?</i>

754
00:47:38,122 --> 00:47:40,022
I'll get you out of this.
I'll fix it.

755
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:41,891
No. Andrei,
you're gonna black out.

756
00:47:41,893 --> 00:47:43,559
- <i>No, I'm not.</i>
- <i>This isn't gonna work.</i>

757
00:47:43,561 --> 00:47:48,264
- <i>We're going to lose them both.</i>
- <i>James, he's fading.</i>

758
00:47:48,266 --> 00:47:49,532
<i>You have to get him in the lock.</i>

759
00:47:56,107 --> 00:47:57,907
Okay. Shit.

760
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:01,377
<i>Rosa, close the airlock now!</i>

761
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:03,646
James is no longer attached to the hull.

762
00:48:03,648 --> 00:48:05,915
- I said close the lock!
- <i>Rosa, close the lock!</i>

763
00:48:11,289 --> 00:48:13,522
<i>Airlock is closed.</i>

764
00:48:13,524 --> 00:48:16,659
Oxygen is flowing.
Repressurization in 10 minutes.

765
00:48:16,661 --> 00:48:19,028
This is insane.
You gotta go get him.

766
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:22,899
We can't. By the time
we get there, he'd--

767
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:28,070
James?

768
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:31,908
Yeah yeah yeah,
I'm here. Umm...

769
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:34,543
Oh, Christ, I can't...

770
00:48:34,545 --> 00:48:37,680
I'm gone.

771
00:48:37,682 --> 00:48:39,248
Oh shit.

772
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:45,588
Is Andrei okay?

773
00:48:46,556 --> 00:48:48,491
<i>Yeah. He's okay.</i>

774
00:48:50,193 --> 00:48:51,527
<i>I'm sorry, James.</i>

775
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:56,565
Don't be sorry.

776
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:00,169
It was an accident, you know?

777
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:02,638
Um...

778
00:49:05,075 --> 00:49:09,712
I-- I don't have much time,
so tell Andrei...

779
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:14,617
Tell Andrei he's a--

780
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:17,086
He's a crazy son of a bitch, you know?

781
00:49:17,088 --> 00:49:19,388
<i>And I love him for trying</i>
<i>to save my life and...</i>

782
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:26,662
If that had been Jamie, I...

783
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,966
I love you so much.

784
00:49:34,604 --> 00:49:36,072
<i>Forgive me.</i>

785
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:42,545
I thought I was trying to do
something great for mankind.

786
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:49,085
I always said it was worth the risk but...

787
00:50:00,697 --> 00:50:03,766
Forgive me for--
for hurting you.

788
00:50:11,641 --> 00:50:16,012
A part of me wishes I could just
float out here forever, you know?

789
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:25,654
<i>I can't s--</i>
<i>I can't see anything.</i>

790
00:50:25,656 --> 00:50:27,757
I can't see any...

791
00:51:26,117 --> 00:51:28,350
It's stupid to argue like this.

792
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:33,355
Katya, no way you can go out
there without us behind you.

793
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:37,626
And, William, with all due respect,

794
00:51:37,628 --> 00:51:41,397
I think we should all decide
together how to do this.

795
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:46,802
I know what you think, William.

796
00:51:48,405 --> 00:51:49,772
What about you, Daniel?

797
00:51:51,341 --> 00:51:53,275
It's ill-advised.

798
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:55,845
A surface walk was always a question mark.

799
00:51:55,847 --> 00:51:58,247
Well, we can do it.
I'll walk the equipment out

800
00:51:58,249 --> 00:52:00,249
and you can run the analysis from here.

801
00:52:00,251 --> 00:52:01,884
We can get what we came for.

802
00:52:01,886 --> 00:52:04,220
And if she goes out there
and we never see her again?

803
00:52:04,222 --> 00:52:05,821
Think hard about that.

804
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:09,525
I think she should do it.
I'm sorry, William.

805
00:52:09,527 --> 00:52:11,894
Thank you.

806
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:16,132
- Andrei?
- It's too dangerous.

807
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:20,803
I vote no.
Absolutely.

808
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:23,873
So that's a tie then.

809
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,542
Rosa?

810
00:52:26,544 --> 00:52:29,345
<i>Katya made our complete cosmic insignificance</i>

811
00:52:29,347 --> 00:52:31,213
<i>seem like a call to arms.</i>

812
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:35,251
<i>What can I say?</i>

813
00:52:35,253 --> 00:52:37,219
<i>She was right.</i>

814
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:41,857
<i>She's still right.</i>

815
00:52:41,859 --> 00:52:43,526
<i>Two hours of e.V.A.</i>

816
00:52:43,528 --> 00:52:45,161
<i>210 meters out.</i>

817
00:52:45,163 --> 00:52:46,595
<i>Search the top layer of ice</i>

818
00:52:46,597 --> 00:52:48,197
<i>while Daniel runs analysis back here.</i>

819
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:49,431
Copy that.

820
00:53:21,866 --> 00:53:22,898
Be careful.

821
00:53:25,236 --> 00:53:27,903
Compared to the breadth
of knowledge yet to be known,

822
00:53:27,905 --> 00:53:30,206
what does your life actually matter?

823
00:53:53,264 --> 00:53:56,799
<i>30 minutes for depressurization.</i>

824
00:54:02,806 --> 00:54:05,941
Batteries live.

825
00:54:08,311 --> 00:54:09,845
<i>Switching to battery power.</i>

826
00:54:09,847 --> 00:54:11,714
<i>Pressure's at 30 kpa.</i>

827
00:54:11,716 --> 00:54:13,749
<i>How's your prep?</i>

828
00:54:18,288 --> 00:54:20,889
<i>30 seconds to egress.</i>

829
00:54:20,891 --> 00:54:22,725
Good luck.

830
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:26,996
<i>I'm ready. ( Sighs )</i>

831
00:54:59,562 --> 00:55:01,497
I can't believe I'm here.

832
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:10,005
<i>We're here.</i>

833
00:55:10,007 --> 00:55:12,007
<i>This is incredible.</i>

834
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:14,843
Radiation is holding steady.

835
00:55:14,845 --> 00:55:17,980
We're at 50 millisieverts per hour--

836
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:19,848
- within acceptable limits.
- I'll check

837
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:21,016
if I can see her from upstairs.

838
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:28,357
<i>It's so still out here.</i>

839
00:55:30,593 --> 00:55:33,462
It's so--
I don't know what the word is.

840
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:37,966
Creepy?

841
00:55:37,968 --> 00:55:40,836
<i>I was going to go with "cosmically outstanding."</i>

842
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:54,917
I wish I could take one of these
gloves off and touch the ice.

843
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:58,987
- Really feel it.
- Please don't.

844
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:03,459
I have visual of her from here.

845
00:56:32,088 --> 00:56:34,523
I'm heading towards the target zone now.

846
00:56:34,525 --> 00:56:36,925
<i>We've got your back.</i>

847
00:56:36,927 --> 00:56:39,428
<i>Life support systems look good.</i>

848
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:48,737
<i>Okay, Katya, you are crossing</i>

849
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:50,105
<i>into the target zone.</i>

850
00:56:51,107 --> 00:56:52,641
<i>You see that?</i>

851
00:56:54,544 --> 00:56:56,078
Where the ice is less deteriorated?

852
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,880
Just set up in the middle of that.

853
00:56:57,882 --> 00:57:00,115
- Here?
- <i>Exactly.</i>

854
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:03,118
She must have been out there for an hour.

855
00:57:06,189 --> 00:57:08,557
But it-- it felt
like an eternity.

856
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:12,161
<i>Each minute seemed to</i>

857
00:57:12,163 --> 00:57:15,864
<i>divide and divide again</i>
<i>into endless moments.</i>

858
00:57:15,866 --> 00:57:17,433
First sample ready for scan.

859
00:57:19,003 --> 00:57:21,503
Sending data back to you now.

860
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:24,573
Are you reading?

861
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:27,576
Running analysis, stand by.

862
00:57:34,717 --> 00:57:37,519
We're negative for trace carbon
<i>and chemotropic processes.</i>

863
00:57:40,056 --> 00:57:42,024
<i>Can you try ice with more trace rust?</i>

864
00:57:42,026 --> 00:57:43,625
<i>You could feel...</i>

865
00:57:44,561 --> 00:57:46,128
Every minute is somehow longer

866
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:47,996
<i>than it had ever been before.</i>

867
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:53,802
- Let's give it another shot.
- <i>Why don't you take</i>

868
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:55,504
the equipment down the linea to zone three?

869
00:57:57,107 --> 00:57:59,007
<i>Radiation is trending upwards, Katya.</i>

870
00:57:59,009 --> 00:58:00,742
<i>You've been out there 70 minutes.</i>

871
00:58:00,744 --> 00:58:02,244
We're so close.

872
00:58:02,246 --> 00:58:04,246
How much time can you give me, William?

873
00:58:04,248 --> 00:58:06,982
<i>You've only got time</i>
<i>for a few more sample sets.</i>

874
00:58:19,129 --> 00:58:21,697
<i>All right, Katya, it's time to come back.</i>

875
00:58:21,699 --> 00:58:23,632
<i>Okay.</i>

876
00:58:23,634 --> 00:58:26,134
I'm digging out
a sub-surface sample

877
00:58:26,136 --> 00:58:27,870
that isn't radiation blasted.

878
00:58:29,706 --> 00:58:31,740
Are you guys seeing this?

879
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:39,515
Here.

880
00:58:39,517 --> 00:58:43,185
I'm getting imaging... now.

881
00:58:50,127 --> 00:58:51,693
It's a unicellular organism,

882
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:54,897
<i>something akin to an algae.</i>

883
00:59:00,136 --> 00:59:01,670
I knew it.

884
00:59:07,311 --> 00:59:11,013
- What is it?
- I don't know for sure, but...

885
00:59:11,015 --> 00:59:12,814
I mean, it's not like it has a name.

886
00:59:12,816 --> 00:59:15,117
It looks like something precambrian to me.

887
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:18,587
That's my first guess
on an Earth-based analogue.

888
00:59:18,589 --> 00:59:20,889
I don't believe it.

889
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:22,624
We did it.

890
00:59:46,716 --> 00:59:49,284
Okay, Katya, let's get you back into the ship

891
00:59:49,286 --> 00:59:52,654
- and sort out this data.
- Packing up.

892
00:59:52,656 --> 00:59:54,923
I hope the champagne's ready.

893
00:59:58,861 --> 01:00:00,128
Look at that.

894
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:03,699
Do you guys read that light in the distance?

895
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:06,935
<i>We're not reading anything.</i>

896
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:09,271
It looks like some kind of chemical iridescence.

897
01:00:09,273 --> 01:00:13,041
I'm going to get closer to investigate.

898
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:17,379
Reserve oxygen will give her another 90 minutes.

899
01:00:17,381 --> 01:00:19,681
<i>Okay, Katya.</i>

900
01:00:19,683 --> 01:00:21,283
<i>Proceed with caution.</i>

901
01:00:21,285 --> 01:00:23,986
I can't see her.

902
01:00:23,988 --> 01:00:25,921
She's moving farther out.

903
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:38,800
It's beautiful.

904
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:42,638
Andrei.
This looks like

905
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,873
it could be the light you were describing.

906
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:50,812
<i>I can see it again.</i>

907
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:52,814
Can you check on my readouts?

908
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:55,283
<i>It's-- it's-- it's--</i>

909
01:00:55,285 --> 01:00:57,152
it's hard to say.

910
01:00:57,154 --> 01:01:00,389
I mean maybe there's other microbial organisms

911
01:01:00,391 --> 01:01:02,224
out there that eat through the ice.

912
01:01:02,226 --> 01:01:05,193
This is a much more complex ecosystem

913
01:01:05,195 --> 01:01:07,262
than we'd previously thought.

914
01:01:09,433 --> 01:01:11,400
I wanna see if it's reacting to my lights.

915
01:01:12,368 --> 01:01:14,403
I'm going to turn them off.

916
01:01:20,044 --> 01:01:21,410
I'm going to get closer.

917
01:01:21,412 --> 01:01:23,445
<i>Hold that action, Katya.</i>

918
01:01:28,919 --> 01:01:30,719
<i>Katya, do you read me?</i>

919
01:01:30,721 --> 01:01:32,954
We have severe electromagnetic interference.

920
01:01:32,956 --> 01:01:34,690
<i>Did you see that?</i>

921
01:01:34,692 --> 01:01:36,024
She has to come back.

922
01:01:36,026 --> 01:01:37,292
...have visual.

923
01:01:37,294 --> 01:01:39,461
I'm going to try to get it back.

924
01:01:43,466 --> 01:01:45,333
I'm seeing it through the ice.

925
01:01:45,335 --> 01:01:48,704
I think it's some sort of bioluminescence.

926
01:01:48,706 --> 01:01:50,405
<i>We've got the data, Katya.</i>

927
01:01:50,407 --> 01:01:52,374
<i>Heat radiation levels are moving with it.</i>

928
01:01:52,376 --> 01:01:54,876
<i>I can't wrap my head around this.</i>

929
01:01:56,313 --> 01:01:58,046
<i>Okay, the ice is thin here,</i>

930
01:01:58,048 --> 01:02:00,148
<i>but it seems stable.</i>
<i>If I get close,</i>

931
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:02,918
- I should be able to get a better look.
- <i>Keep your line open.</i>

932
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,352
<i>I want to know what's</i>
<i>happening out there.</i>

933
01:02:04,354 --> 01:02:05,921
<i>The ground is not stable!</i>

934
01:02:05,923 --> 01:02:08,390
<i>The ice is breaking.</i>

935
01:02:08,392 --> 01:02:11,493
Katya, can you hear me?
Come back to the ship now!

936
01:02:11,495 --> 01:02:14,196
It's cracking the ice!

937
01:02:14,198 --> 01:02:17,232
My foot is...

938
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:25,173
- Katya, do you read me? Come in!
- Get her back in!

939
01:02:25,175 --> 01:02:27,442
- Get her back in!
- Katya, come in. Do you read me?

940
01:02:27,444 --> 01:02:29,244
- She's not listening.
- Rosa, do you see her out there?

941
01:02:29,246 --> 01:02:31,379
<i>Nothing. Just the ice.</i>

942
01:02:36,352 --> 01:02:38,520
- She's under the ice.
- <i>What?</i>

943
01:02:41,124 --> 01:02:43,959
Under the water.

944
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:51,967
We've still got her helmet cam.

945
01:03:52,461 --> 01:03:54,329
Whatever it was,

946
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:56,565
it was reacting to the light on her helmet.

947
01:03:56,567 --> 01:03:59,568
That's the behavior of a complex organism.

948
01:04:01,437 --> 01:04:03,338
The logs, the data--

949
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:05,841
they don't show any proof of complex life.

950
01:04:05,843 --> 01:04:07,609
We can't leave until we have that.

951
01:04:09,045 --> 01:04:11,313
We don't know how long we'll be stable here.

952
01:04:11,315 --> 01:04:14,316
And we've lost two of our crew.

953
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:16,117
If we never leave,

954
01:04:16,119 --> 01:04:19,588
no one on Earth will ever
know what we discovered.

955
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:23,191
I agree.

956
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:25,260
We need to leave now.

957
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:30,298
When the next launch window opens, we take off.

958
01:04:31,234 --> 01:04:32,601
Mmm.

959
01:04:32,603 --> 01:04:36,071
I want all the data
secured and double-checked...

960
01:04:36,073 --> 01:04:39,274
Especially everything Katya found.

961
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:55,156
- <i>T-minus 32 seconds to liftoff.</i>

962
01:04:55,158 --> 01:04:57,092
<i>Prepping for ascent ignition.</i>

963
01:04:58,428 --> 01:05:00,095
Orbital sync is established.

964
01:05:00,097 --> 01:05:03,498
<i>Docking operation in t-minus eight minutes.</i>

965
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:14,109
- <i>Give me a systems check.</i>
- <i>Engine temperature's rising.</i>

966
01:05:14,111 --> 01:05:17,646
<i>Andrei?</i>

967
01:05:17,648 --> 01:05:19,547
<i>Booster 3 is stuck at 30%.</i>

968
01:05:19,549 --> 01:05:22,217
<i>We've got to launch now.</i>

969
01:05:34,398 --> 01:05:37,499
Launch in three, two, one.

970
01:05:44,206 --> 01:05:45,206
<i>What the hell?</i>

971
01:05:45,208 --> 01:05:46,608
I can't keep it steady.

972
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:48,977
<i>Our trajectory is way off course.</i>

973
01:05:52,982 --> 01:05:56,418
Injectors are melting!

974
01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:58,620
We've got engine mixture ratio errors

975
01:05:58,622 --> 01:06:00,422
in engines two and three.

976
01:06:00,424 --> 01:06:03,625
- We're nowhere near orbital transfer!
- Hey!

977
01:06:03,627 --> 01:06:06,594
I can try to correct course at apogee.

978
01:06:06,596 --> 01:06:08,730
- The vernier thrusters might do it!
- We need to shut

979
01:06:08,732 --> 01:06:10,632
- <i>the valves down!</i>
- <i>Get us back down on the surface.</i>

980
01:06:10,634 --> 01:06:13,001
- What?
- Don't engage the second burn.

981
01:06:13,003 --> 01:06:14,636
You mean crash us?

982
01:06:14,638 --> 01:06:17,639
What's happening up there?

983
01:06:23,446 --> 01:06:25,380
Valves dow...

984
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:38,693
2,000 meters.

985
01:06:38,695 --> 01:06:40,161
1900.

986
01:06:40,163 --> 01:06:41,629
I can't keep it steady.

987
01:06:41,631 --> 01:06:46,468
- ...still dropping!
- <i>...Coming in too fast!</i>

988
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:52,674
What are you doing?
William!

989
01:06:52,676 --> 01:06:55,477
- William!
- I'm going to slow us down.

990
01:06:57,681 --> 01:07:01,016
I'm going to blow the water shielding.

991
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:05,286
It'll create... thrust!

992
01:07:05,288 --> 01:07:07,722
- Brace for impact!
- <i>200 meters!</i>

993
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:27,802
Andrei? Andrei?

994
01:08:27,804 --> 01:08:30,605
- Huh?
- Wake up, wake up!

995
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:37,212
William?

996
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:41,616
Okay.

997
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:49,757
He's dead.

998
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:51,626
He saved us.

999
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,834
<i>Europa wasn't ready to let us go yet.</i>

1000
01:09:02,872 --> 01:09:04,706
It quickly became apparent that

1001
01:09:04,708 --> 01:09:07,175
we crashed into the original landing zone.

1002
01:09:08,277 --> 01:09:10,445
Ironic, I suppose.

1003
01:09:13,449 --> 01:09:16,384
<i>This zone was much warmer,</i>

1004
01:09:16,386 --> 01:09:19,821
<i>much more active than any</i>
<i>previous data had suggested.</i>

1005
01:09:19,823 --> 01:09:22,724
Underwater vents had rendered the ice brittle

1006
01:09:22,726 --> 01:09:25,160
and unstable and constantly shifting

1007
01:09:25,162 --> 01:09:26,794
<i>and then you add onto that</i>

1008
01:09:26,796 --> 01:09:29,197
<i>William had jettisoned the water shielding</i>

1009
01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:32,200
<i>on descent and that had saved them,</i>

1010
01:09:32,202 --> 01:09:34,903
but it also left them

1011
01:09:34,905 --> 01:09:38,173
dangerously exposed to radiation.

1012
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:41,376
<i>We're leaking oxygen.</i>

1013
01:09:41,378 --> 01:09:43,645
And we're also losing heat--

1014
01:09:43,647 --> 01:09:46,447
three degrees since I started checking.

1015
01:09:46,449 --> 01:09:50,618
If I would bet, we'd freeze before we suffocate.

1016
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:54,889
<i>The exterior light should be working.</i>

1017
01:09:54,891 --> 01:09:57,659
<i>Daniel, can you check?</i>

1018
01:09:58,661 --> 01:10:00,628
- Daniel?
- <i>I am.</i>

1019
01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:02,397
<i>It's not good.</i>

1020
01:10:03,332 --> 01:10:06,701
The ice is cracking under the ship.

1021
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:11,206
<i>You can almost see the ice/water interface.</i>

1022
01:10:12,441 --> 01:10:14,576
We're gonna be under the ice
in a matter of hours.

1023
01:10:16,812 --> 01:10:18,780
Our last shot is docking with the orbiter...

1024
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:22,717
And using its back-up
life support systems.

1025
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:25,753
If the propulsion system is still alive...

1026
01:10:26,989 --> 01:10:29,357
I can get us into orbit.

1027
01:10:30,326 --> 01:10:32,260
Come help me.

1028
01:10:42,004 --> 01:10:43,771
It's pointless.

1029
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:54,816
Is this what you're looking for?

1030
01:10:54,818 --> 01:10:57,285
Yeah.
Thank you.

1031
01:11:06,930 --> 01:11:08,329
Shit!

1032
01:11:12,802 --> 01:11:14,936
- Are you all right?
- The ice broke through.

1033
01:11:14,938 --> 01:11:17,472
This is it.
It's happening.

1034
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:23,044
It's the end.

1035
01:11:31,487 --> 01:11:33,554
We'll find a way.

1036
01:11:34,857 --> 01:11:36,457
We have to.

1037
01:11:41,397 --> 01:11:43,464
The fuel line is partially frozen.

1038
01:11:43,466 --> 01:11:45,833
That caused the loss of thrust.

1039
01:11:45,835 --> 01:11:47,902
We're lodged in the ice.

1040
01:11:47,904 --> 01:11:49,470
Can we even take off properly?

1041
01:11:49,472 --> 01:11:51,005
If we time it right, maybe.

1042
01:11:51,007 --> 01:11:53,474
Two hours is the fastest we can fix it,

1043
01:11:53,476 --> 01:11:55,777
but that is if...

1044
01:11:55,779 --> 01:11:58,079
Two of us is working on it.

1045
01:11:58,081 --> 01:12:00,315
- You mean the three of us?
- No.

1046
01:12:00,317 --> 01:12:02,483
You have to stay inside, prep engines.

1047
01:12:06,021 --> 01:12:08,856
The fix must happen outside the ship.

1048
01:12:10,794 --> 01:12:13,461
<i>That was that.</i>

1049
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:16,497
Are you ready?

1050
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:19,734
Are you?

1051
01:12:19,736 --> 01:12:21,703
<i>Daniel and Andrei entered the airlock</i>

1052
01:12:21,705 --> 01:12:23,438
for final
de-pressurization.

1053
01:12:24,373 --> 01:12:26,107
Here.

1054
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:33,781
Two hours.

1055
01:12:33,783 --> 01:12:36,417
Then I'll see you both
back here. Yeah?

1056
01:12:42,424 --> 01:12:44,992
<i>And that...</i>

1057
01:12:50,733 --> 01:12:52,100
...brings us to now.

1058
01:12:56,405 --> 01:12:58,439
<i>If we don't make it...</i>

1059
01:13:01,811 --> 01:13:03,478
This record...

1060
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:09,951
One day...

1061
01:13:13,088 --> 01:13:14,989
<i>Just in case.</i>

1062
01:13:17,025 --> 01:13:18,760
Just in case.

1063
01:13:58,867 --> 01:14:01,169
<i>Depressurization complete.</i>

1064
01:14:01,171 --> 01:14:03,805
Pressure is 25 kilopascals.

1065
01:14:05,074 --> 01:14:07,175
I'll go first,

1066
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:10,077
make sure the ice is stable.

1067
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:13,481
<i>Beginning egress.</i>

1068
01:14:13,483 --> 01:14:14,982
Roger that.

1069
01:14:17,787 --> 01:14:19,921
<i>System signals are strong.</i>

1070
01:14:22,659 --> 01:14:24,959
Hatch is open.

1071
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:32,066
Oh shit.

1072
01:14:33,702 --> 01:14:35,102
The ladder is a bit skewed,

1073
01:14:35,104 --> 01:14:37,205
but I think I can make it.

1074
01:14:39,741 --> 01:14:41,742
The ice beneath the ship is cracked,

1075
01:14:41,744 --> 01:14:43,845
but it looks sturdy.

1076
01:14:43,847 --> 01:14:46,747
Taking my first step now.

1077
01:14:46,749 --> 01:14:48,883
<i>Be careful.</i>

1078
01:14:48,885 --> 01:14:51,118
<i>We're picking up the same radiation signature.</i>

1079
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:54,822
Okay.
Taking my first step now.

1080
01:14:54,824 --> 01:14:56,891
<i>I am on the ice.</i>

1081
01:14:59,795 --> 01:15:01,496
Oh God.
I can feel it...

1082
01:15:03,032 --> 01:15:06,100
Daniel? Daniel?!

1083
01:15:06,102 --> 01:15:08,236
- Do you read me?
- <i>Daniel?!</i>

1084
01:15:12,709 --> 01:15:15,009
Daniel? Andrei?

1085
01:15:16,145 --> 01:15:18,012
Talk to me!

1086
01:15:31,894 --> 01:15:34,829
Rosa, shut off the exterior lights.

1087
01:15:34,831 --> 01:15:38,065
- Turn off the exterior lights!
- Okay.

1088
01:15:39,801 --> 01:15:41,536
<i>I'm getting nothing.</i>

1089
01:15:41,538 --> 01:15:43,237
<i>His Mike is dead.</i>
<i>His camera is dead.</i>

1090
01:15:43,239 --> 01:15:45,139
<i>He just vanished.</i>

1091
01:15:48,644 --> 01:15:50,311
<i>Do you read me?</i>

1092
01:15:52,247 --> 01:15:54,215
What the hell is going on out there?

1093
01:15:54,217 --> 01:15:56,250
<i>I don't know.</i>

1094
01:15:56,252 --> 01:15:58,185
What?

1095
01:15:58,187 --> 01:16:01,322
I lost him. I lost him.

1096
01:16:02,624 --> 01:16:04,926
The ice cracked beneath him.

1097
01:16:04,928 --> 01:16:07,228
Daniel? Daniel?

1098
01:16:07,230 --> 01:16:09,230
<i>He was surrounded by lights,</i>

1099
01:16:09,232 --> 01:16:11,032
<i>then he was gone.</i>

1100
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:27,748
Tell me...

1101
01:16:30,619 --> 01:16:33,120
Tell me we can still patch the fuel line.

1102
01:16:36,359 --> 01:16:38,993
<i>Andrei?</i>
<i>Say something.</i>

1103
01:16:40,028 --> 01:16:42,597
- Andrei?
- <i>We can't.</i>

1104
01:16:44,299 --> 01:16:46,367
There's one thing still worth trying.

1105
01:16:49,172 --> 01:16:52,173
<i>The communication array</i>
<i>is still salvageable.</i>

1106
01:16:54,643 --> 01:16:57,278
<i>I can fix it if I take parts</i>

1107
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:58,980
<i>from the life support.</i>

1108
01:16:58,982 --> 01:17:02,383
I don't know.

1109
01:17:02,385 --> 01:17:04,819
<i>Can you still prep data sync?</i>

1110
01:17:11,693 --> 01:17:13,794
<i>Rosa, we can do this.</i>

1111
01:17:31,713 --> 01:17:33,180
How will I know when?

1112
01:17:33,182 --> 01:17:36,083
<i>When I remove life support batteries</i>

1113
01:17:36,085 --> 01:17:38,252
you'll lose power in the command module.

1114
01:17:38,254 --> 01:17:41,255
Then data sync...

1115
01:17:43,792 --> 01:17:45,860
<i>Keep talking to me.</i>

1116
01:17:45,862 --> 01:17:47,895
<i>Keep the line open.</i>

1117
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:53,367
It's dark.

1118
01:17:53,369 --> 01:17:55,036
It's not gonna be easy.

1119
01:17:55,038 --> 01:17:56,404
<i>Andrei?</i>

1120
01:17:56,406 --> 01:17:58,239
I've lost your camera again.

1121
01:17:58,241 --> 01:18:00,808
- <i>Can you hear me?</i>
- <i>Uh-huh.</i>

1122
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:02,710
- Okay.
- <i>It's not far.</i>

1123
01:18:02,712 --> 01:18:04,345
Camera's back up.

1124
01:18:04,347 --> 01:18:07,415
10 paces...

1125
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:26,934
Andrei?

1126
01:18:26,936 --> 01:18:28,402
Come on, come on.

1127
01:18:41,883 --> 01:18:44,418
<i>Andrei, I can see the light behind you.</i>

1128
01:18:50,025 --> 01:18:51,792
Hurry, please.

1129
01:18:53,061 --> 01:18:55,496
<i>I can see water under the ship.</i>

1130
01:18:55,498 --> 01:18:57,431
Come on, hold on.

1131
01:19:00,136 --> 01:19:01,502
Another malfunction.

1132
01:19:01,504 --> 01:19:03,871
I need to check the drives.

1133
01:19:07,509 --> 01:19:09,176
Work, please.

1134
01:19:11,113 --> 01:19:13,447
- It's just one more tweak and I'm done.
- <i>Andrei?</i>

1135
01:19:13,449 --> 01:19:16,383
<i>Do you read me?</i>
<i>Do you read me?!</i>

1136
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:21,188
<i>There's a cabinet in the cockpit...</i>

1137
01:19:21,190 --> 01:19:23,390
<i>...That I've been working with.</i>

1138
01:19:23,392 --> 01:19:25,025
<i>Join the wires...</i>

1139
01:19:26,261 --> 01:19:28,095
<i>And the systems will start.</i>

1140
01:19:28,097 --> 01:19:30,097
Command module is just about dead.

1141
01:19:33,001 --> 01:19:35,035
We're losing cameras here.

1142
01:19:35,037 --> 01:19:36,470
I'm moving to the--

1143
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:45,446
Andrei?

1144
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:48,983
I'm connecting the wires.

1145
01:19:50,418 --> 01:19:52,052
Almost there.
Almost there.

1146
01:19:54,322 --> 01:19:58,292
Rosa, it's working! It's working!

1147
01:20:08,937 --> 01:20:11,972
Oh God.
<i>We're running out of time!</i>

1148
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:16,944
Communications are up.

1149
01:20:16,946 --> 01:20:20,014
<i>You did it!</i>

1150
01:20:20,016 --> 01:20:23,918
You need to see this!
Are you getting this?!

1151
01:20:25,521 --> 01:20:28,155
The luminescence is all around the ship now!

1152
01:20:28,157 --> 01:20:30,257
The exterior cameras are dying.

1153
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:33,294
Can you hear me?

1154
01:20:33,296 --> 01:20:34,995
Andrei?

1155
01:20:36,165 --> 01:20:38,332
The ship is sinking into the ice!

1156
01:20:38,334 --> 01:20:39,333
Oh!

1157
01:20:43,972 --> 01:20:45,272
Andrei?

1158
01:20:45,274 --> 01:20:48,275
Do-- do you read?
Andrei?

1159
01:20:50,912 --> 01:20:51,912
Andrei, do you read?

1160
01:20:51,914 --> 01:20:53,881
Talk to me.
Talk to me.

1161
01:20:54,616 --> 01:20:56,016
Andrei, talk to me!

1162
01:21:37,926 --> 01:21:40,394
<i>Compared to the breadth</i>
<i>of knowledge yet to be known...</i>

1163
01:21:40,396 --> 01:21:44,331
<i>...what does your life actually matter?</i>

1164
01:22:40,655 --> 01:22:42,957
<i>In those final moments,</i>

1165
01:22:42,959 --> 01:22:45,726
<i>knowing communication had been re-established,</i>

1166
01:22:45,728 --> 01:22:48,729
<i>Rosa chose to open the airlock.</i>

1167
01:22:53,435 --> 01:22:55,269
<i>I got the call at 3:00 A.M.</i>

1168
01:22:55,271 --> 01:22:58,472
Telling me that communication
had been re-established.

1169
01:22:58,474 --> 01:23:01,442
By the time I got into our mission control

1170
01:23:01,444 --> 01:23:03,444
<i>our servers were flooded</i>
<i>with images of our crew.</i>

1171
01:23:08,183 --> 01:23:10,451
Our mission had finally come back to us.

1172
01:23:21,529 --> 01:23:24,031
<i>We saw the sacrifices</i>
<i>they made for each other</i>

1173
01:23:24,033 --> 01:23:26,467
<i>to keep the mission alive,</i>

1174
01:23:26,469 --> 01:23:28,769
<i>to push the discovery further.</i>

1175
01:23:33,475 --> 01:23:35,576
And that final image--

1176
01:23:35,578 --> 01:23:37,378
startling.

1177
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:40,647
Terrifying.
Completely beyond

1178
01:23:40,649 --> 01:23:43,484
our wildest theoretic models.

1179
01:23:45,053 --> 01:23:47,087
<i>The discovery of this creature</i>

1180
01:23:47,089 --> 01:23:50,057
<i>is simply extraordinary.</i>

1181
01:23:50,725 --> 01:23:53,193
<i>We now know that our universe</i>

1182
01:23:53,195 --> 01:23:56,196
<i>is far stranger, far more alive</i>

1183
01:23:56,198 --> 01:23:58,098
<i>than we had ever imagined.</i>

1184
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:01,168
<i>The crew of Europa One</i>

1185
01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:03,604
<i>changed the fundamental context</i>

1186
01:24:03,606 --> 01:24:06,240
<i>in which all of humanity</i>
<i>understands itself.</i>

1187
01:24:08,076 --> 01:24:11,412
<i>I don't know what greater measure of success</i>

1188
01:24:11,414 --> 01:24:12,813
<i>they could have achieved.</i>

1189
01:24:12,815 --> 01:24:15,282
- Is this smiling? Smiling?
- Wet your lip.

1190
01:24:15,284 --> 01:24:17,351
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.
