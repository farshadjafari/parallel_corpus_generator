1
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,916
<i>Choose life. Choose a job.</i>

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,036
<i>Choose a career. Choose a family.</i>

3
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,758
<i>Choose a fucking big television.</i>

4
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,675
<i>Choose washing machines, cars,
compact disc players, electrical tin openers.</i>

5
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,437
<i>Choose good health,
low cholesterol and dental insurance.</i>

6
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,795
<i>Choose fixed-interest mortgage repayments.</i>

7
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,553
<i>Choose a starter home.</i>

8
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,789
<i>Choose your friends.</i>

9
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,196
<i>Choose leisure wear and matching luggage.</i>

10
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,829
<i>Choose a three-piece suite on hire purchase
in a range of fucking fabrics.</i>

11
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,957
<i>Choose DIY and wondering
who the fuck you are on a Sunday morning.</i>

12
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,589
<i>Choose sitting on a couch
watching spirit-crushing game shows...</i>

13
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,148
<i>...stuffing fucking junk food
into your mouth.</i>

14
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,509
Tommy, go!

15
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,309
<i>Choose rotting away,
pissing your last in a miserable home...</i>

16
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,039
<i>...nothing more than an embarrassment
to the selfish brats...</i>

17
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,031
<i>...that you've spawned to replace yourself.</i>

18
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,076
<i>Choose your future. Choose life.</i>

19
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,558
<i>But why would I want to do
a thing like that?</i>

20
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,190
<i>I chose not to choose life.
I chose something else. And the reasons?</i>

21
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,757
<i>There are no reasons.</i>

22
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,634
<i>Who needs reasons
when you've got heroin?</i>

23
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,554
<i>Goldfinger is better than Dr. No.</i>

24
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,077
<i>Both of them are a lot better
than Diamonds Are Forever.</i>

25
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,517
A judgment reflected in
its relatively poor showing at the box office.

26
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,589
<i>And in which field, of course,
Thunderball was a notable success.</i>

27
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,634
<i>People think
it's all misery and death, all that shite...</i>

28
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,358
<i>...which is not to be ignored.</i>

29
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,351
Fuck off! Jealous cunt.

30
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,633
<i>But what they forget
is the pleasure of it.</i>

31
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,273
They're all dead.

32
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,634
You prick!

33
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,158
<i>Otherwise we wouldn't do it.</i>

34
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,590
- Do you want me to do it?
- Yeah.

35
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,513
Pure as the driven snow, that shit.

36
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,749
<i>After all, we're not fucking stupid.
Well, at least we're not that fucking stupid.</i>

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,595
<i>Take the best orgasm you ever had,
multiply it by a thousand...</i>

38
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,558
<i>...and you're still nowhere near it.</i>

39
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,030
It beats any meat injection.

40
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,192
And it beats any fucking cock in the world.

41
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,759
<i>When you're on junk,
you have one worry: scoring.</i>

42
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,799
<i>When you're off it, you're suddenly obliged
to worry about all sorts of other shite.</i>

43
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,236
<i>Got no money, can't get drunk.
Got money, drinking too much.</i>

44
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,471
<i>Can't get a girl, no chance of a ride.
Got a girl, too much hassle.</i>

45
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,312
<i>You have to worry about bills, about food,
about some football team that never wins...</i>

46
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,995
<i>...about human relationships,
and all the things that really don't matter...</i>

47
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,038
<i>...when you've got
a sincere and truthful junk habit.</i>

48
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,399
I'd say, in those days,
he was a muscular actor.

49
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,550
With all the presence
of someone like Cooper or Lancaster...

50
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,234
...but combined with a sly wit...

51
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,512
...to make him a formidable romantic lead...

52
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,913
...and closer in that respect to Cary Grant.

53
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,916
<i>The only drawback,
or at least the principal drawback...</i>

54
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,039
<i>...is that you have to endure
all manner of cunts telling you:</i>

55
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,475
No way would I poison my body
with that shit.

56
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,350
All them fucking chemicals.

57
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,154
No fucking way.

58
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,349
It's a waste of your life, man,
poisoning your body with that shit.

59
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,350
Every chance you've had, Son,
you've blown it.

60
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,317
Stuffing your veins with that filth.

61
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,350
<i>From time to time,
even I have uttered the magic words.</i>

62
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,350
Never again, Swanney.
I'm off the skag.

63
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,793
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

64
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,270
I'm finished with that shite.
That's up to you.

65
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,158
I'll do it right this time.
I'll get off it for good.

66
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,038
- I've heard that one before.
- The Sick Boy method.

67
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,554
It really worked for him, eh?
He's always lacked moral fibre.

68
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,076
- He knows a lot about Sean Connery.
- That's hardly a substitute.

69
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,718
You'll need one more hit.

70
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,675
No, I don't think so.
For the long night ahead.

71
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,669
<i>We called him Mother Superior
on account of the length of his habit.</i>

72
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,957
<i>Of course, I'd have another shot.
After all, I had work to do.</i>

73
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,953
<i>Relinquishing junk.
Stage one: Preparation.</i>

74
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,158
<i>For this you will need one room,
which you will not leave.</i>

75
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,676
<i>Soothing music. Tomato soup, ten tins of.</i>

76
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,316
<i>Mushroom soup, eight tins of,
for consumption cold.</i>

77
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,996
<i>Ice cream, vanilla, one large tub of.
Magnesia, milk of, one bottle.</i>

78
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,671
<i>Paracetamol, mouthwash,
vitamins, mineral water, Lucozade...</i>

79
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,996
<i>...pornography.</i>

80
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,669
<i>One mattress.</i>

81
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,475
<i>One bucket for urine,
one for faeces, and one for vomitus.</i>

82
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,110
<i>One television and one bottle of Valium...</i>

83
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,555
<i>...which I've already procured
from my mother, who is...</i>

84
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:52,316
<i>...in her own domestic and socially
acceptable way, also a drug addict.</i>

85
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,839
<i>Now I'm ready.</i>

86
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,559
<i>All I need is one final hit
to soothe the pain...</i>

87
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,790
<i>...while the Valium takes effect.</i>

88
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,999
Mikey. Aye, it's Mark Renton.

89
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,589
Look, I wondered, could you help me out?

90
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,194
<i>This was typical of Mikey Forrester.</i>

91
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,199
What the fuck are these?

92
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,473
<i>Under the normal run of things...</i>

93
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,757
<i>...I'd have nothing to do with the cunt,
but this wasn't the normal run of things.</i>

94
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,159
Opium suppositories.

95
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,952
Ideal for your purposes.

96
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,153
Slow release, bring you down gradually.

97
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,990
Custom fucking designed for your needs.

98
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,354
I want a fucking hit.

99
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,308
That's all I've got, man. Take it or leave it.

100
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,508
You're feeling better now, eh?

101
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,990
For the good they've done me,
I might as well have stuck them up my ass.

102
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,315
<i>Heroin makes you constipated.</i>

103
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,678
<i>The heroin from my last hit is fading away,
and the suppositories have yet to melt.</i>

104
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,037
<i>I'm no longer constipated.</i>

105
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,357
<i>I fantasise about a massive,
pristine convenience...</i>

106
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:21,150
<i>...brilliant gold taps, virginal white marble,
a seat carved from ebony...</i>

107
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,151
<i>...a cistern full of Chanel No. 5...</i>

108
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,869
<i>...and a flunky handing me
pieces of raw silk toilet roll.</i>

109
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,796
<i>But under the circumstances,
I'll settle for anywhere.</i>

110
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,435
Fuck.

111
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,636
Yes, a fucking godsend.

112
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,114
<i>And now...</i>

113
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,474
<i>...now I'm ready.</i>

114
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,635
<i>The downside of coming off junk
was I knew I'd need...</i>

115
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,757
<i>...to mix with my friends again
in a state of full consciousness.</i>

116
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,875
<i>It was awful.</i>

117
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,191
<i>They reminded me so much of myself,
I could hardly bear to look at them.</i>

118
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,511
<i>Take Sick Boy, for instance.
He came off junk at the same time as me...</i>

119
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,637
<i>...not because he wanted to,
but just to annoy me.</i>

120
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,713
<i>Just to show me how easily he could do it,
thereby downgrading my own struggle.</i>

121
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,996
<i>Sneaky fucker, don't you think?</i>

122
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,231
<i>When all I wanted to do was lie there
and feel sorry for myself...</i>

123
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,869
<i>...he insisted on telling me once again
about his unifying theory of life.</i>

124
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,111
It's certainly a phenomenon
in all walks of life.

125
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,838
What do you mean?

126
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:44,116
Well, at one point you've got it,
then you lose it, and it's gone forever...

127
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,872
...all walks of life.

128
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,558
Georgie Best, for example, had it, lost it.

129
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,111
Or David Bowie, or Lou Reed.

130
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,316
Lou Reed,
his solo stuff is not bad.

131
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,073
It's not bad,
but it's not great either, is it?

132
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:02,188
In your heart, you know that although
it sounds all right, it's actually just shite.

133
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,319
So, who else?

134
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,234
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven,
Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley.

135
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,153
Okay, so what's the point
you're trying to make?

136
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:20,391
<i>All I am trying to do is to help you
understand that The Name of the Rose...</i>

137
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,712
...is merely a blip on an otherwise
uninterrupted downward trajectory.

138
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,793
<i>What about The Untouchables?</i>

139
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,712
I don't rate that at all.

140
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,876
Despite the Academy award?

141
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,478
That means fuck all. It's a sympathy vote.

142
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,356
So, we all get old,
we can't hack it anymore and that's it?

143
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,989
Yeah.

144
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,998
That's your theory?

145
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,349
Yeah.

146
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,750
Beautifully fucking illustrated.

147
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,549
Give me the gun.

148
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,198
Give me the gun.

149
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,758
Do you see the beast?

150
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,751
<i>Have you got it in your sights?</i>

151
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,599
Clear enough, Miss Moneypenny.

152
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,195
This should present
no significant problems.

153
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,115
For a vegetarian, Rents,
you're a fucking evil shot.

154
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:33,232
<i>Without heroin, I attempted to
lead a useful, fulfilling life as a good citizen.</i>

155
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,951
- Good luck, Spud.
- Cheers.

156
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,998
Remember: If they think you're not trying,
you're in trouble.

157
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,470
A hint of that and they'll be on to the DHSS,
"This cunt is not trying. "

158
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,869
- And your Giro's fucking finished, right?
- Right.

159
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,032
- But then again, try too hard...
- You might get the fucking job.

160
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,712
- Exactly.
- Nightmare.

161
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,394
It's a tightrope, Spud.
It's a fucking tightrope.

162
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,835
I just get pure shy with the interviewer cats.

163
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,912
I get all nervous
and I can't answer any of their questions...

164
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,878
...like I'm a footballer
and I get nerves on the big occasion.

165
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,109
Try some of this.

166
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,760
A little dab of speed is just the ticket, man.

167
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,310
No, I went to Craigie, Craignewton.

168
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,312
I just put down Royal Edinburgh College
to help get the job.

169
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,597
There's too much discrimination.
They're both schools, right?

170
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,148
We're in this together,
and I wanted to put across...

171
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,789
...the general idea rather than the details.
People get hung up on details.

172
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,474
Which school did I go to?
How many grades did I get?

173
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,835
Could be six, could be none.
It's not important.

174
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,753
What is important is that I am.

175
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,709
Mr. Murphy, do you mean
that you lied on your application?

176
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,429
No! Well, yes.
Only to get my foot in the door.

177
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,392
Showing initiative and that, like.

178
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,153
You were referred
by the Department of Employment.

179
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,596
There was no need for you
to get your "foot in the door" as you put it.

180
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,069
Yeah, cool. Whatever you say.

181
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,435
Sorry, you're the man,
the dude in the chair.

182
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,876
I am merely here. Obviously, I'm here.

183
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,236
Mr. Murphy, what exactly attracts
you to the leisure industry?

184
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,157
In a word, pleasure.

185
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,949
My pleasure in other people's leisure.

186
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,270
Do you see yourself
as having any weaknesses?

187
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,909
Yes! I'm a bit of a perfectionist, actually.
Yes, I am.

188
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,958
See, for me it's got to be the best
or it's nothing at all.

189
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,918
Like, if things get a bit dodgy,
I just cannot be bothered.

190
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,310
But, I'm getting good vibes
about this interview thing today.

191
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,153
<i>Seems to me like it's going pretty well, eh?</i>

192
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,393
Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

193
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,318
<i>We'll let you know.</i>

194
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,073
The pleasure was mine, man.

195
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,116
<i>He'd done well, I was proud.</i>

196
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,715
<i>He fucked up good and proper.
You had to hand it to Spud.</i>

197
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,993
Picture the scene:
The other fucking week there...

198
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,435
...down the fucking Volley.
Me and Tommy playing pool.

199
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,750
I'm playing like Paul fucking Newman
by the way.

200
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,070
Giving the boy here
the tanning of a lifetime.

201
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,074
So it comes to the end, the last shot,
the deciding ball of the whole tournament.

202
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,630
I'm on the black and he's sat in the corner
looking all fucking biscuit-assed...

203
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,157
...when this hard cunt comes in,
obviously fucking fancied himself.

204
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,358
Starts staring at me...

205
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,194
...looking right fucking at me
as if to say, "Come ahead, square go. "

206
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,517
You know me. I'm not the type
that goes looking for fucking bother...

207
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,558
<i>...but at the end of the day
I'm the cunt with the pool cue...</i>

208
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,837
<i>...and he can get the fat end in his puss
any time he wanted, like.</i>

209
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,435
So I squares up, casual like.

210
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,393
What does the hard cunt do?

211
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,075
Well, the so-called hard cunt shites it...

212
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:35,631
...puts down his drink, turns and gets
the fuck out of there, and after that...

213
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,076
...well, the game was mine.

214
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,273
<i>That was it?</i>

215
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,239
<i>That was Begbie's story. Or at least
that was Begbie's version of the story.</i>

216
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,439
<i>A couple of days later
I got the truth from Tommy.</i>

217
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,990
<i>You always got the truth from Tommy.
It was one of his major weaknesses.</i>

218
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,470
<i>He never told lies, he never took drugs,
and he never cheated on anyone.</i>

219
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,311
It was Wednesday morning.
We're in the Volley playing pool, that's true.

220
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,756
But Begbie is playing
absolutely fucking gash.

221
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,399
<i>He's got a hangover so bad
he can hardly hold the cue...</i>

222
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,833
<i>...never mind pot a ball.</i>

223
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,913
I'm doing my best to lose, you know,
trying to humour him.

224
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,513
<i>But it's not doing any good.</i>

225
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,160
<i>Every time I touch a ball,
I seem to pot something.</i>

226
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,073
<i>Every time Begbie goes near the table,
he fucks it up.</i>

227
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,593
Oh, fuck's sake.

228
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,749
So, he's got the hump, right.

229
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,439
<i>But, finally, I managed to set it up
so all he has to do is to pot the black...</i>

230
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,159
...to win one game,
to salvage a little bit of pride...

231
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,879
<i>...and maybe not kick my head in, right.</i>

232
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,032
<i>So, he's on the black, pressure shot.</i>

233
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,548
<i>Then it all goes wrong, big time.</i>

234
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,675
Fuck!

235
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,789
<i>He picks on a specky wee gadge
at the bar...</i>

236
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,519
<i>...and accuses him of putting him off
by looking at him.</i>

237
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,114
<i>The poor cunt hasn't even glanced
in our direction.</i>

238
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,189
Fuck off!

239
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,350
<i>He was going to chib him,
I tell you.</i>

240
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,479
Then I thought
he was going to do me.

241
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,354
<i>The Beggar is fucking psycho, man.</i>

242
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,277
<i>But he's a mate, you know.
So what can you do?</i>

243
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,195
Can I borrow this?

244
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,839
<i>What could one do? Just stand
back and watch, and try not to get involved?</i>

245
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,638
<i>Begbie didn't do drugs either.</i>

246
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,518
<i>He just did people, that's what he got off on.</i>

247
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,955
<i>His own sensory addiction.</i>

248
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:40,556
The lassie got glassed and no cunt leaves
here till we find out what cunt did it.

249
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,159
Who the fuck are you?

250
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,631
<i>It's so good.
I'm coming.</i>

251
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,709
<i>As I sat watching the intimate
and highly personal video...</i>

252
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,031
<i>...stolen only hours earlier
from one of my best friends...</i>

253
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:24,318
<i>...I realised that something important
was missing from my life.</i>

254
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,031
<i>I read it in Cosmopolitan.
It's an interesting theory.</i>

255
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,553
Actually, it's a nightmare.

256
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,358
I've been desperate for a shag...

257
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,829
...but watching him suffer
was just too much fun.

258
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,158
You should try it with Tommy.

259
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,152
What, and deny myself the only pleasure
I get from him?

260
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,559
Did I tell you about my birthday?

261
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,030
- No, what happened?
- He forgot. Useless motherfucker.

262
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,672
What are you two talking about?

263
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,234
Football.

264
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,753
What are you talking about?

265
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,235
Shopping.

266
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,396
<i>The situation
was becoming serious.</i>

267
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,912
<i>Young Renton noticed the haste
with which the successful...</i>

268
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,790
<i>...in the sexual sphere, as in all others,
segregated themselves from the failures.</i>

269
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:26,000
<i>Heroin had robbed Renton of his sex drive,
but now it returned with a vengeance.</i>

270
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,799
<i>As the impotence of those days
faded into memory...</i>

271
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,190
<i>...grim desperation
took a hold in his sex-crazed mind.</i>

272
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,235
<i>His post-junk libido,
fuelled by alcohol and amphetamine...</i>

273
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,869
<i>...taunted him remorselessly
with his own unsatisfied desire.</i>

274
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,996
<i>Dot, dot, dot.</i>

275
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,432
<i>And with that,
Mark Renton had fallen in love.</i>

276
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,870
Excuse me. I don't mean to
harass you, but I was impressed...

277
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,032
...with the capable and stylish manner
in which you dealt with that situation.

278
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,429
I was thinking to myself,
"Now, this girl's special. "

279
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,475
Thanks.

280
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,118
- What's your name?
- Diane.

281
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,270
- Where are you going, Diane?
- I'm going home.

282
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,510
- Where's that?
- It's where I live.

283
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,430
Great.

284
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,396
What?

285
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,916
I'll come back with you if you like,
but I'm not promising anything.

286
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,195
Do you find
that this approach usually works?

287
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,635
Or let me guess, you've never tried it before.

288
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,871
In fact, you don't normally approach girls,
am I right?

289
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,520
The truth is that you're a quiet,
sensitive type...

290
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,639
...but if I'm prepared to take a chance,
I might just get to know the inner you:

291
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,918
Witty, adventurous,
passionate, loving, loyal.

292
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,149
Taxi!

293
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,951
A little bit crazy,
a little bit bad. But, hey...

294
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,755
...don't us girls just love that?

295
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,312
Well, what's wrong, boy?
Cat got your tongue?

296
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,029
I left something...

297
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,796
Are you getting in or not, pal?

298
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:13,950
Do you understand? I expect you
to be a considerate and thoughtful lover.

299
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,918
- Generous but firm.
- What?

300
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,390
Failure on your part to live up
to these very reasonable expectations...

301
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,155
...will result in swift resumption
of a non-sex situation.

302
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,989
Right?

303
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,552
- What?
- Shut up!

304
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,473
Wake up, Spud.

305
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,510
Wake up.

306
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,349
Sex.

307
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,553
Casual sex.

308
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,030
Tommy, let's put the tape on.

309
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,429
Now?

310
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,988
I want to watch ourselves
while we're screwing.

311
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,909
So, let's see what I'm missing.

312
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,274
Not much.

313
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:09,034
<i>There's Archie
Gemmill, picking it up from the outside.</i>

314
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,791
<i>I think he wants to go himself.
I'm certain he's got a goal.</i>

315
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,711
<i>He's going all the way. And he scores!</i>

316
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,198
<i>What a magnificent goal!</i>

317
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,671
<i>Gemmill at his very best.</i>

318
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,399
<i>What a penetrating goal that was!</i>

319
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,588
I haven't felt that good since Archie Gemmill
scored against Holland in 1978.

320
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,109
Right.

321
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,834
You can't sleep here.

322
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,433
What?
Out.

323
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,275
Come on.

324
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:40,149
No argument. You can sleep on the sofa
in the hall or go home, it's up to you.

325
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,035
And don't make any noise.

326
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,234
Jesus.

327
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,997
What do you mean, "It's gone"?
Where has it gone, Tommy?

328
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,593
It’ll be here somewhere.

329
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:03,077
I might have returned it by mistake.
Returned it?

330
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,159
Where? The video shop, Tommy?

331
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,711
The fucking video shop?

332
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,757
So every punter in Edinburgh
is jerking off to our video?

333
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,833
God, Tommy, I feel sick.

334
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,478
Hi.
Hello.

335
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,557
Come in and sit down.

336
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,478
Like some coffee?

337
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,749
Aye.

338
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,039
You must be Mark.
Aye, that's me.

339
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,631
Are you a friend of Diane's?
A friend of a friend.

340
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,709
Right.

341
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,555
Are you her flatmates?

342
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,193
Flatmates?

343
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,791
I must remember that one.

344
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,108
'Morning.

345
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,920
- Good morning, Spud.
- 'Morning, Gail.

346
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,116
Mr. Houston. Mrs. Houston.

347
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,237
'Morning, Spud.
Sit down and have some breakfast.

348
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,031
Sorry about last night, by the way.

349
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,634
That's all right. I slept fine on the sofa.

350
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,111
I had a bit much to drink,
had a bit of an accident.

351
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,876
Don't worry, son. These things happen.

352
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,679
Does a man good
to cut loose once in a while.

353
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,593
This one could do with being tied up
once in a while.

354
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:52,309
- I'll put the sheets in the machine just now.
- No, I'll wash them.

355
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,072
- There's no need.
- It's no problem.

356
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,513
It's no problem for me, either.

357
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,398
- I'd rather take care of it myself.
- Honestly, it's no problem.

358
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,789
- Really, no!
- Spud, they're my sheets.

359
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,033
I don't see why not.
Because it's illegal.

360
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,350
Holding hands?
Not holding hands.

361
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,839
In that case you can do it.

362
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,309
You were quite happy
to do a lot more last night.

363
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,879
That's what's illegal.

364
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,678
Do you know what they do
to people like me inside?

365
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,194
They cut your balls off,
flush them down the toilet.

366
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:32,319
- Calm down. You're not going to jail.
- Well, that's very easy for you to say, Diane.

367
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,073
- Can I see you again?
- Certainly not.

368
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,471
If you don't see me again, I'll tell the police.

369
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,399
I'll see you around then.

370
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,794
Now what?

371
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,714
We go for a walk.

372
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,438
What?
A walk.

373
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,635
Where?
There.

374
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,713
Are you serious?

375
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,679
What are you waiting for?

376
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,359
Hey, Tommy.

377
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,599
This is not natural, man.

378
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,676
It's the great outdoors.

379
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,549
It's fresh air.

380
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,598
Look, Tommy, we know
you're getting a hard time off Lizzy...

381
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,353
...but there's really no need
to take it out on us.

382
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,918
- Doesn't it make you proud to be Scottish?
- It's shite being Scottish.

383
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:07,315
We're the lowest of the low.
The scum of the fucking earth.

384
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,349
The most wretched,
miserable, servile, pathetic trash...

385
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,908
...that was ever shat into civilisation.

386
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,549
Some people hate the English, I don't.
They're just wankers.

387
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,757
We, on the other hand,
are colonised by wankers.

388
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,430
Can't even find a decent culture
to be colonised by.

389
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,429
We're ruled by effete assholes.

390
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,835
It's a shite state of affairs to be in, Tommy.

391
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,959
And all the fresh air in the world
won't make any fucking difference.

392
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,155
Sorry, man. Sorry.
No, I'm sorry.

393
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,078
I appreciate it, Tommy.

394
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,593
<i>At or around this time...</i>

395
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:52,116
<i>...Spud, Sick Boy and I made a healthy,
informed, democratic decision...</i>

396
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,430
<i>...to get back on heroin as soon as possible.</i>

397
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,670
<i>Took about 12 hours.</i>

398
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,276
<i>It looks easy this, but it's not.</i>

399
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,679
<i>It looks like a doss, like a soft option...</i>

400
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,595
<i>...but living like this,
it's a full-time business.</i>

401
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:33,757
Ursula Andress,
the quintessential Bond girl.

402
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,077
<i>That's what everyone says.</i>

403
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,357
The embodiment, right,
of his superiority to us.

404
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,317
Beautiful, exotic, highly sexual...

405
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,513
...yet totally unavailable
to anyone apart from him.

406
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,439
Shite. I mean, let's face it...

407
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:55,354
...if she'd shag one punter from Edinburgh,
she'd shag the whole fucking lot of us.

408
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,160
Yep, I knew he was going to do that.

409
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:23,195
Lizzy's gone, Mark.
She's gone and fucking dumped me.

410
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,518
It was that videotape.

411
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,438
<i>That Iggy Pop business
and all sorts of other shit.</i>

412
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,237
She told me where to go
and no fucking mistake.

413
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,473
I said to her, I said:

414
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,028
"Is there any chance
of getting back together?"

415
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,519
But no fucking way.

416
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:46,238
Honor Blackman,
a. k. a. Pussy Galore, right?

417
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,439
What a total fucking misnomer.

418
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,315
I mean,
I wouldn't touch her with yours.

419
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,311
I want to try it, Mark.

420
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,190
You're always going on about
how it's like the ultimate hit.

421
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,599
Better than sex.

422
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,677
Come on, man,
I'm a fucking adult, I can find out for myself.

423
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,434
I've got the money.

424
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,837
Personality, I mean that's what counts,
right?

425
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,870
Personality, I mean that's what keeps
a relationship going through the years.

426
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,399
Like heroin.

427
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,190
I mean...

428
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,430
...heroin's got great fucking personality.

429
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,991
<i>Swanney taught us to respect
the National Health Service...</i>

430
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,116
<i>...for it was the source
of much of our gear.</i>

431
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,033
<i>We stole drugs,
we stole prescriptions or bought them...</i>

432
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,918
<i>...sold them, swapped them,
forged them, photocopied them.</i>

433
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:04,557
<i>Or traded drugs with cancer victims,
alcoholics, old-age pensioners...</i>

434
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,393
<i>...AIDS patients,
epileptics and bored housewives.</i>

435
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:11,679
<i>We took morphine, diamorphine,
cyclizine, codeine, temazepam...</i>

436
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,599
<i>...nitrezepam, phenobarbitone,
sodium amytal...</i>

437
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:18,673
<i>...dextropropoxyphene, methadone,
nalbuphine, pethidine, pentazocine...</i>

438
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,752
<i>...buprenorphine,
dextromoramide, chlormethiazole.</i>

439
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,475
<i>The streets are awash with drugs
you can have for unhappiness and pain...</i>

440
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,152
<i>...and we took them all.</i>

441
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:31,719
<i>We would have injected vitamin C
if only they'd made it illegal.</i>

442
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,477
Pardon me, may I use your bathroom?
Thank you.

443
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,069
Stop, psycho.

444
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,588
Rent-boy. No fucking smack.

445
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,118
<i>But the good times couldn't last forever.</i>

446
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,074
<i>I think Allison had been screaming all day,
but it hadn't really registered before.</i>

447
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,080
<i>She might have been screaming
for a week for all I knew.</i>

448
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,230
<i>It'd been days since I heard anyone speak.</i>

449
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,278
<i>Surely someone must've said something
in all that time.</i>

450
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,715
<i>Surely to fuck someone must have.</i>

451
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,597
Allison!
Help me!

452
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,669
Calm down.

453
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,750
Everyone's going to be just fine.

454
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,110
<i>Nothing could've been further
from the truth.</i>

455
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,479
<i>In point of fact,
nothing was going to be just fine.</i>

456
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,199
<i>On the contrary,
everything was going to be bad.</i>

457
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:58,910
<i>Bad, I mean, everything was going to be
even worse than it already was.</i>

458
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,792
My God! No, my God!

459
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:16,876
Fuck!

460
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,996
Please, please!

461
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:30,075
<i>It wasn't my baby. She wasn't
my baby. Baby Dawn, she wasn't mine.</i>

462
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,711
<i>Spud's, Swanney's, Sick Boy's,
I don't know.</i>

463
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,350
<i>Maybe Allison knew, maybe not.</i>

464
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:42,353
<i>I wished I could think of something to say.
Something sympathetic.</i>

465
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,509
<i>Something human.</i>

466
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,158
Say something, Mark.

467
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,636
Fucking say something, huh?

468
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,789
I'm cooking up.

469
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,749
Cook us up a shot, Rents.
I really need a hit.

470
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,518
<i>So she did,
I could understand that...</i>

471
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,159
<i>...to take the pain away.</i>

472
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,711
<i>So I cooked up and she got a hit.</i>

473
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,876
<i>But only after me,
that went without saying.</i>

474
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,709
<i>Well, at least we knew
who the father was now.</i>

475
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,516
<i>It wasn't just the baby that died that day.</i>

476
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,478
<i>Something inside Sick Boy was lost
and never returned.</i>

477
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:48,116
<i>It seemed he had no theory
with which to explain a moment like this.</i>

478
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,189
<i>Nor did I.</i>

479
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,673
<i>Our only response was to keep on going
and fuck everything.</i>

480
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:57,518
<i>Pile misery upon misery, heap it up on
a spoon and dissolve it with a drop of bile.</i>

481
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,388
<i>Then squirt it into a stinking, purulent vein
and do it all over again.</i>

482
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:05,359
<i>Keep on going, getting up, going out,
robbing, stealing, fucking people over.</i>

483
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,194
<i>Propelling ourselves with longing
towards the day that it would all go wrong.</i>

484
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,356
<i>Because no matter how much you stash...</i>

485
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,749
<i>...or how much you steal,
you never have enough.</i>

486
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,877
<i>No matter how often you go out
and rob and fuck people over...</i>

487
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,679
<i>...you always need to get up
and do it all over again.</i>

488
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,476
<i>Sooner or later this kind of thing
was bound to happen.</i>

489
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:35,039
Because shoplifting is theft,
which is a crime...

490
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:39,352
<i>...and despite what you may believe,
there is no such entity as victimless crime.</i>

491
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,830
Heroin addiction may explain your actions,
but it does not excuse them.

492
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,714
Mr. Murphy, you are a habitual thief,
devoid of regret and remorse.

493
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,075
<i>I'm sentencing you
to six months imprisonment.</i>

494
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:52,311
<i>My only worry is that it will not be long
before we meet again.</i>

495
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,952
Mr. Renton, I understand you have entered
into a program of rehabilitation...

496
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,191
...in an attempt to wean yourself
away from heroin.

497
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,396
The suspension of your sentence...

498
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,711
...is conditional on your continued
co-operation with this program.

499
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,870
<i>Should you stand guilty before me again...</i>

500
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,838
...I shall not hesitate
to impose a custodial sentence.

501
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,357
Thank you, Your Honour.

502
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,238
With God's help,
I'll conquer this terrible affliction.

503
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,549
<i>What can you say?</i>

504
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,837
<i>Well, Begbie had a phrase for it.</i>

505
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,231
It was fucking obvious
that cunt was going to fuck some cunt.

506
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,311
Hope you've learned your lesson,
Son.

507
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,154
My son, I thought
I was going to lose you there.

508
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,437
You're nothing but trouble to me,
but I still love you.

509
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,709
You'd better clean up your fucking act,
sunshine. Cut that shite out forever.

510
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,598
Listen to Francis, Mark. He's talking sense.

511
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:58,195
Fucking right I am. See, inside,
you wouldn't last two fucking days.

512
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,272
There are better things than the needle,
Rents. Choose life.

513
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:05,115
I remember when you were
a wee baby. "Mama's little baby

514
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,997
"loves shortening, shortening

515
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,753
"Mama's little baby
loves shortening bread"

516
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,191
I'm sorry, Mrs. Murphy.

517
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,116
It was not fair,
Spud going down and not me.

518
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,199
Well, it's not our fault.

519
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,553
Your boy went down
because he was a fucking smack-head.

520
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,154
If that's not your fault,
then I don't know what is.

521
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,513
I was the fucking cunt
that tried to get him off it.

522
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,471
I'll get the fucking drinks in.

523
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,119
<i>I wished I'd gone down
instead of Spud.</i>

524
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:57,591
<i>Here I was, surrounded by my family
and my so-called mates...</i>

525
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,911
<i>...and I've never felt so alone.
Never in all my puff.</i>

526
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,799
<i>Since I was on remand,
they've had me on this program...</i>

527
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,030
<i>...the state-sponsored addiction...</i>

528
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:13,033
<i>...three sickly sweet doses
of methadone a day instead of smack.</i>

529
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,951
<i>But it's never enough.</i>

530
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,236
<i>At the moment, it's nowhere near enough.</i>

531
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,515
<i>I took all three this morning.
Now I've got 18 hours until my next shot...</i>

532
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,757
<i>...and a sweat on my back
like a layer of frost.</i>

533
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,478
<i>I need to visit the Mother Superior
for one hit.</i>

534
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,238
<i>One fucking hit...</i>

535
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,199
<i>...to get us over this long, hard day.</i>

536
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,077
What's on the menu tonight?
Your favourite dish.

537
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,195
Excellent.

538
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,836
Usual table, sir?
Thank you.

539
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,957
Would sir care to pay for his bill
in advance?

540
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,633
No, stick it on my tab.

541
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:54,998
I regret to inform, credit limit was reached
and breached quite some time ago.

542
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,912
Well, in that case...

543
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,989
Hard currency, that'll do nicely.

544
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:03,436
Can't be too careful
when we're dealing with your type, can we?

545
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,513
Would sir care for a starter?
Some garlic bread perhaps?

546
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:12,435
No, thank you. I'll proceed directly
to the intravenous injection of hard drugs.

547
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:16,112
As you wish, sir.

548
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:14,352
Perhaps sir would like me
to call for a taxi?

549
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,749
Open your eyes.

550
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,270
Wake up. Come on. Wake up.

551
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:54,352
<i>I don't feel the sickness yet,
but it's in the mail, that's for sure.</i>

552
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,830
<i>I'm in the junkie limbo at the moment:</i>

553
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,433
<i>Too ill to sleep.</i>

554
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:00,557
<i>Too tired to stay awake.</i>

555
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,957
<i>But the sickness is on its way.</i>

556
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:08,039
<i>Sweat, chills, nausea, pain and craving.</i>

557
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:11,397
<i>A need like nothing else I've ever known
will soon take hold of me.</i>

558
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,878
<i>It's on its way.</i>

559
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:23,189
"Oh, you've got green eyes
Oh, you've got blue eyes

560
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,152
"Oh, you've got grey eyes

561
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:30,875
"And I've never seen anyone
quite like you before

562
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:36,034
<i>"No, I've never met anyone
quite like you before"</i>

563
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,712
We'll help you, Son.

564
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,152
You'll stay here with us
until you get better.

565
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:00,832
We're going to beat this together.

566
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,434
Maybe I should go back to the clinic.

567
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:07,190
No! No clinics. No methadone.

568
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:10,759
That only made you worse,
you said so yourself.

569
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:16,632
You lied to us, Son,
your own mother and father.

570
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,716
- You could bring us some jellies.
- No!

571
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,550
You're worse coming off that
than the heroin.

572
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:24,074
Nothing!
It's a clean break this time.

573
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,674
You're staying here
where we can keep an eye on you.

574
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,990
I appreciate
what you're doing, but...

575
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:33,153
...I just need one more score.
Just bring me one more hit, please.

576
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:36,190
I need one more fucking hit.

577
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:38,919
You fuck.

578
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:43,669
Shit.

579
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,910
Well, this is a good fucking laugh, ain't it?

580
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:06,872
You sweat that shite out of your system
because if I come back and it's still here...

581
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,595
...I’ll fucking kick it out.

582
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:11,710
Okay.

583
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:21,909
God!

584
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:41,951
<i>Question number one:
The human immunodeficiency virus is a?</i>

585
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,792
<i>- Retrovirus?
- Retrovirus is the right answer.</i>

586
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,635
<i>It's a mug's game, Mrs. Renton.</i>

587
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:01,717
<i>I mean, I'm not saying
I was blameless myself, far from it, but...</i>

588
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:05,877
<i>...there comes a time when you have
to turn your back on that nonsense...</i>

589
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:07,712
<i>...and just say no.</i>

590
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,156
<i>Just say no.</i>

591
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,794
<i>Oh, my God, she's dead.</i>

592
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,392
<i>Question number two:</i>

593
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:50,156
<i>HIV binds to which receptor
on the host lymphocyte?</i>

594
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,196
<i>Which receptor is that?</i>

595
00:52:58,720 --> 00:52:59,835
<i>CD4.</i>

596
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:02,674
<i>CD4 is the right answer.</i>

597
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:09,991
Better than sex, Rents. Better than sex.

598
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,798
The ultimate hit.

599
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:17,357
I'm a fucking adult, I can find out for myself.

600
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,834
Well, I'm finding out, all right.

601
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:27,555
Tommy.

602
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,509
No!

603
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,631
<i>Is he guilty? Or not guilty?</i>

604
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,189
<i>He's our son.</i>

605
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,919
Don't! Dawn!

606
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,234
Stop!

607
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,034
No!

608
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:00,156
No! Don't do this to me!

609
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,668
Stop!

610
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:08,789
Mark.

611
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:11,709
Mark.

612
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,470
There's something you need to do.

613
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,512
Come alive, 35.

614
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,917
Box of tricks, 66.

615
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,438
Mark, you've got a house.

616
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,792
For goodness sake, Mark.

617
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,354
<i>It seems I am the luckiest guy
in the world.</i>

618
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:07,193
<i>Several years of addiction
in the middle of an epidemic...</i>

619
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,191
<i>...surrounded by the living dead.</i>

620
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,676
<i>But not me. I'm negative.</i>

621
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,718
<i>It's official.</i>

622
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,398
<i>Once the pain goes away,
that's when the real battle starts.</i>

623
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,118
<i>Depression, boredom...</i>

624
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:22,711
<i>You feel so fucking low,
you want to fucking top yourself.</i>

625
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:26,993
Tommy.

626
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,911
Tommy, it's Mark, man.

627
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,832
You all right, mate?

628
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,630
Getting out much, Tommy?
No.

629
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,469
- Following the game at all?
- No.

630
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,076
No, me neither, really.

631
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,152
You take the test?

632
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:35,155
Aye.

633
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:38,869
Clear?

634
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,069
Aye.

635
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,799
That's nice.

636
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,115
I'm sorry, Tommy.

637
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:53,639
Got any gear on you?

638
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,433
No, I'm clean, man.

639
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,796
Well, sub us then, mate.

640
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,199
I'm expecting a rent check.

641
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:19,873
Thanks, Mark.

642
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:21,919
No bother.

643
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:29,591
<i>No bother. None at all.
Not for me, anyway.</i>

644
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:32,432
<i>It's easy to be philosophical...</i>

645
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:35,671
<i>...when it's some other poor cunt
with shite for blood.</i>

646
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:44,553
What do you want?

647
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,517
- Are you clean?
- Yes.

648
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:49,637
Is that a promise?
It is, as a matter of fact.

649
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,472
Calm down, I'm only asking.

650
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,468
- Is that hash that I can smell?
- No.

651
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:01,035
- I wouldn't mind a bit if it is.
- Well, it isn't.

652
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:03,836
- It smells like it.
- You're too young.

653
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,831
I'm too young for what?

654
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,316
You're not getting any younger, Mark.

655
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:20,479
The world's changing,
music's changing, even drugs are changing.

656
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:25,032
You can't stay in here all day
dreaming about heroin and Ziggy Pop.

657
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:26,798
It's Iggy Pop.

658
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,275
Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.

659
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,716
Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year.
Tommy went to see him.

660
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:35,553
The point is,
you've got to find something new.

661
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,799
<i>She was right.
I had to find something new.</i>

662
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:43,072
<i>There was only one thing for it.</i>

663
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:26,473
Lifestyle Letting Agency.

664
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:29,279
Yes. It's a beautifully converted
Victorian town house.

665
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:33,708
<i>Ideally located in a quiet road
near to the local shops and transport.</i>

666
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,395
<i>This one's two bedrooms
and a kitchen/diner.</i>

667
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,994
<i>Fully fitted, in excellent decorative order.</i>

668
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:40,433
<i>Lots of storage space.</i>

669
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:44,195
<i>All mod cons and it's going at £320 a week.</i>

670
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,797
<i>I settled in not too badly
and kept myself to myself.</i>

671
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:58,395
<i>Sometimes, I thought about the guys,
but mainly I didn't miss them at all.</i>

672
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:02,553
<i>This was boomtown, where any fool
could make cash from chaos and plenty did.</i>

673
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:03,959
<i>Tell you what I've got.</i>

674
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:07,476
I've got a beautifully converted
Victorian town house.

675
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,512
<i>I quite enjoyed the sound of it.</i>

676
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:14,151
<i>Profit, loss, margins, takeovers, lending,
letting, sub-letting, sub-dividing...</i>

677
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,709
<i>...cheating, scamming,
fragmenting, breaking away.</i>

678
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,631
Who's got the keys to Talgarth Road?

679
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,472
<i>There was no such thing as society.</i>

680
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:23,791
<i>Even if there was,
I certainly had nothing to do with it.</i>

681
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,595
<i>For the first time in my adult life
I was almost content.</i>

682
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:32,395
<i>"Dear Mark, I'm glad
you found a job and somewhere to live.</i>

683
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:37,198
<i>"School is fine at the moment.
I'm not pregnant, but thanks for asking.</i>

684
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:40,750
<i>"Your friend Sick Boy asked me
last week if I would like to work for him.</i>

685
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,472
<i>"But I told him where to go.</i>

686
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:47,076
<i>"I met Spud who sends his regards.
Or at least I think that's what he said.</i>

687
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:51,712
<i>"No one has seen Tommy for ages.</i>

688
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:55,679
<i>"And finally, Francis Begbie
has been on television a lot this week.</i>

689
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:58,997
<i>"He is wanted by the police
in connection with an armed robbery...</i>

690
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:00,877
<i>"... in a jeweller's in Corstorphine.</i>

691
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,428
<i>"Take care. Yours, with love, Diane. "</i>

692
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,432
<i>Francis Begbie.</i>

693
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:18,434
Oh, no.

694
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,392
Armed robbery?

695
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:21,435
With a replica?

696
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:24,671
How the fuck can it be armed robbery
with a fucking replica?

697
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:28,275
Fucking scandal. My gear, look.

698
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:34,671
Supposed to be fucking solid silver,
it's fucking garbage.

699
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,117
There's young couples investing
all their fucking hopes in that stuff.

700
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,555
- It's a scandal, Franco.
- Too fucking right it is.

701
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,551
How about one of these Pot Noodles
by the way?

702
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,551
I'm fucking Lee Marvin.

703
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:53,829
Hey, Rents.

704
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,480
<i>Begbie settled in, in no time at all.</i>

705
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,317
I've no fucking cigarettes.

706
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:30,869
It's me.

707
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:34,594
Rents.

708
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,432
<i>Yeah, the guy's a psycho.</i>

709
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:46,069
<i>But it's true, he's a mate and all,
so what can you do?</i>

710
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:08,189
Pop down the bookies
and put a line on for us.

711
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:10,396
Can you not go yourself?

712
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:15,276
I'm a fugitive from the law,
and I can't walk the fucking streets. You go.

713
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:23,152
Doncaster. 4:40. £5 to win. Bad Boy.

714
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:35,119
Buy some fucking beer and all.

715
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:45,678
Come on, Bad Boy.
Come on, son. Yeah!

716
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:50,959
Yeah.

717
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,553
Bad Boy.

718
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:59,316
<i>Came in at 16-to-1.</i>

719
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:02,437
<i>With the winnings, we went out to celebrate.</i>

720
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:33,115
<i>Diane was right.
The world is changing.</i>

721
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:36,749
<i>Music is changing, drugs are changing,
even men and women are changing.</i>

722
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:41,235
<i>1,000 years from now, there'll be no guys
and no girls, just wankers.</i>

723
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:43,072
<i>Sounds great to me.</i>

724
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,192
<i>It's just a pity no one told Begbie.</i>

725
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:08,160
Fuck! Fuck!

726
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:12,194
<i>If you ask me, we're heterosexual
by default, not by decision.</i>

727
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:14,475
<i>It's just a question of whom you fancy.</i>

728
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:17,791
<i>It's all about aesthetics
and it's fuck all to do with morality.</i>

729
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:19,349
Fuck!

730
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:22,792
<i>But try telling Begbie that.</i>

731
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:26,154
I'm not a fucking buftie
and that's the end of it.

732
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:28,590
Let's face it, it could have been wonderful.

733
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:34,797
Fucking listen to me,
you piece of junkie shit.

734
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:39,075
A joke's a fucking joke,
you mention that again and I'll cut you up.

735
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:41,713
You understand?

736
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:51,278
<i>Since I last saw him, Sick Boy had
reinvented himself as a pimp and a pusher...</i>

737
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:53,749
<i>...and was here
to mix business and pleasure...</i>

738
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:56,957
<i>...setting up contacts,
as he constantly informed me...</i>

739
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:01,079
<i>...for the great smack deal
that was one day going to make him rich.</i>

740
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:07,913
Good chips.

741
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:10,791
I can't believe you did that.

742
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:15,670
I got a good price for it.

743
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,399
Rents, I need the money.

744
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:19,436
It was my fucking telly.

745
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:24,392
If I'd known you were going to get so
humpty about it, I wouldn't have bothered.

746
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:29,196
Fucking rented anyway.

747
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:32,071
Are you going to eat that?

748
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:40,232
- Have you got a passport?
- Why?

749
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:44,549
I met this bloke who runs a hotel, brothel.

750
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:46,359
Loads of contacts.

751
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:50,228
He does a nice sideline
in punting British passports to foreigners.

752
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:52,397
Get you a good price.

753
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,436
Why would I want to sell my passport?

754
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:00,798
It was just an idea.

755
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:04,158
<i>I had to get rid of them.</i>

756
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:07,277
<i>Sick Boy didn't do his drug deal
and he didn't get rich.</i>

757
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:11,069
<i>Instead, he and Begbie just hung around
my bed-sit looking for things to steal.</i>

758
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:14,277
<i>I decided to offer them one of London's
most desirable properties.</i>

759
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,797
<i>They weren't paying any rent.</i>

760
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:44,519
<i>So when my boss found
two desperate suckers who would...</i>

761
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:47,160
<i>...Sick Boy and Begbie
were bound to feel threatened.</i>

762
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:52,559
Lots of storage. All mod cons, £320 a week.

763
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:57,514
<i>And that was that.</i>

764
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:00,874
<i>But by then we had another reason
to go back.</i>

765
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,228
<i>Tommy.</i>

766
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:06,234
<i>Tommy knew he'd got the virus,
but he never knew he'd gone full-blown.</i>

767
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,237
What was it, pneumonia or cancer?

768
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:13,154
No, toxoplasmosis. It's like a stroke.

769
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:15,073
How's that?

770
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,478
He wanted to see Lizzy again.

771
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,916
She would not let him near the house.

772
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:23,634
So he bought her a present.
He bought her this kitten.

773
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:27,877
<i>Lizzy told him where to stick it?
Exactly.</i>

774
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:30,793
<i>"I'm not wanting a cat,"
she says, "Get to fuck, right. "</i>

775
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:35,239
So there's Tommy, stuck with this kitten.
You can imagine what happened.

776
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:37,276
To those of us
gathered here today...

777
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:41,919
...Thomas McKenzie filled a number
of different roles in our lives.

778
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:43,513
Thomas was a son...

779
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:47,275
The thing was neglected,
pissing and shitting all over the place.

780
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:51,592
Tommy was lying about, fucked out
of his eyeballs on smack or downers.

781
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:55,117
He never knew you could get
toxoplasmosis from cat shit.

782
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:59,397
...a loving man
who had a great lust for life.

783
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:03,877
- Neither did I. What is it?
- Fucking horrible.

784
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:08,070
- It's like an abscess in your brain.
- Fucking hell!

785
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:09,275
Then what happened?

786
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:14,396
<i>He starts getting these headaches,
so he just uses more smack, for the pain.</i>

787
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:18,431
<i>Then he has a stroke. A fucking stroke.</i>

788
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:20,033
<i>Just like that.</i>

789
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:24,550
<i>He gets home from the hospital
and dies three weeks later.</i>

790
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:28,669
<i>He'd been dead for ages before
the neighbours complained of the smell...</i>

791
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:31,433
<i>...and got the police to break down the door.</i>

792
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:33,755
<i>Tommy was lying face down
in a pool of vomit.</i>

793
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:37,799
<i>He has gone from us, but we have
many things to remember him by.</i>

794
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:39,954
The kitten was fine.

795
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:42,998
Would you all please rise now
for the committal?

796
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:50,632
<i>"Did you think
I would leave you crying</i>

797
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:55,039
<i>"When there's room on my horse for two?</i>

798
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:00,599
"Climb up here, Tommy, don't be dying

799
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:04,675
"I can go just as fast with two

800
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:09,917
"When we grow up, we'll both be soldiers

801
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:13,875
"And our horses will not be toys

802
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:19,278
"And I wonder if we'll remember

803
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:23,269
"When we were two little boys"

804
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:28,237
Tommy.

805
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,031
Did you tell him yet?

806
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:37,069
On you go.

807
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:38,275
What?

808
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:41,916
There's this mate of Swanney's.
You know him, Mikey Forrester.

809
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,149
Aye.

810
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,436
He's come into some gear.

811
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:51,150
A lot of gear.
How much gear?

812
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:56,954
About two kilos. So he tells me.

813
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:01,192
He got drunk in a pub
down by the docks last week...

814
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,396
...where he met two Russian sailors.

815
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:07,833
<i>They're fucking carrying
the stuff. For sale there and then, like.</i>

816
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:12,550
So, he wakes up next morning,
realises what he's done...

817
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:16,269
...gets very fucking nervous.
He wants rid of this, right?

818
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:17,476
So?

819
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:19,039
So, he met me...

820
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:22,915
...and I offered to take it off his hands
at a very reasonable price...

821
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:26,834
...with the intention of punting it
on myself to a guy I know in London.

822
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:32,075
We've just come back from Tommy's funeral
and you're talking about a skag deal?

823
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:34,309
Aye.

824
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:39,877
What was your price?

825
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:42,196
£4,000.
You haven't got £4,000.

826
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:45,192
- We're £2,000 short.
- Well, that's tough.

827
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:49,595
Look, Mark, every cunt knows
you've been saving up down in London.

828
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:52,478
I'm sorry, boys, I do not have £2,000.

829
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:54,478
Aye, you fucking do.

830
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:57,918
I've seen your bank statement.

831
01:11:58,240 --> 01:11:59,798
For fuck's sake.

832
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:04,476
£2,133.

833
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:07,434
Two kilos. What is that, ten years?

834
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:11,269
Mikey Forrester, Russian sailors,
what the fuck are you boys on?

835
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:13,272
You've already been to jail.

836
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:15,669
Do you like it so much,
you want to go back?

837
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,319
I just want the money, Mark.

838
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:22,995
If everybody keeps their fucking
mouth shut, there'll be no cunt going to jail.

839
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:29,188
<i>I hadn't told anyone everything
running though my mind...</i>

840
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:31,157
<i>...about what might happen in London.</i>

841
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:34,397
<i>There were a lot of possibilities
I didn't want to talk about.</i>

842
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,596
<i>Ideas best kept to myself.</i>

843
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:39,590
<i>What no one told me
when we bought the smack...</i>

844
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:42,717
<i>...some lucky punter
would have to try it out.</i>

845
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:50,233
<i>Begbie didn't trust Spud and Sick Boy
was too careful these days.</i>

846
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:55,070
<i>So I rolled up my sleeve, I spiked my vein,
and I did what had to be done.</i>

847
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:02,799
It's good. Oh, it's really fucking good.

848
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:09,916
<i>Yeah, that hit was good.</i>

849
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:12,918
<i>I promised myself another one
before we got to London.</i>

850
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:18,120
<i>Just one, for old time's sake.
Just to piss Begbie off.</i>

851
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:20,718
<i>This was his nightmare.</i>

852
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:23,553
<i>The dodgiest scam
in a lifetime of dodgy scams.</i>

853
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:27,633
<i>Being perpetrated with three of the most
useless and unreliable fuck-ups in town.</i>

854
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:30,438
<i>I knew what was going on in his mind.</i>

855
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:33,114
<i>Any trouble in London,
and he would dump us immediately.</i>

856
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:35,395
<i>One way or another, he had to.</i>

857
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:39,349
<i>If he got caught with a bag full of smack
on top of that armed robbery shit...</i>

858
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:41,954
<i>...he was going down for 15 to 20.</i>

859
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:46,398
<i>Begbie was hard. But not so hard
that he didn't shite it off 20 years in prison.</i>

860
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:56,469
<i>This was to be my final hit.</i>

861
01:13:56,640 --> 01:14:01,156
<i>But let's be clear about this.
There are final hits and final hits.</i>

862
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:03,396
<i>What kind was this to be?</i>

863
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:10,549
- Did you bring the cards?
- What?

864
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:13,678
The cards, the last thing I told you
was to mind the cards.

865
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,319
I've not brought them.

866
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:20,474
It's fucking boring after a while
without the cards.

867
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:21,549
I'm sorry.

868
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:24,835
- Bit fucking late.
- Why didn't you bring them?

869
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:28,515
'Cause I fucking told you to bring them,
you doss cunt.

870
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:29,989
Christ.

871
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:17,432
These are your friends, right?

872
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:20,398
These are the guys I mentioned.
Okay.

873
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:22,710
Is he here?
Yeah, he's here.

874
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:26,759
You didn't get followed?
We didn't get followed.

875
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:27,955
Okay.

876
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:46,352
All right.
Hi.

877
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:51,829
<i>Straight away he clocked us
for what we were:</i>

878
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:54,480
<i>Small-time wasters
with an accidental big deal.</i>

879
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:06,554
Excuse me, gentlemen.

880
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:01,872
How much would you like for this?

881
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,632
£20,000.

882
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:11,112
I don't think it's worth
much more than £15,000.

883
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:14,397
<i>This was a real drag to him.
He didn't need to negotiate.</i>

884
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:17,109
<i>What were we going to do with it
if he didn't buy it?</i>

885
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:19,794
<i>Sell it on the streets? Fuck that.</i>

886
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:23,999
- Well, £19,000.
- Terribly sorry, I can't go to £19,000.

887
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:28,273
Well, fucking £16,000 then.

888
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:33,953
Okay. Well, fucking £16,000 it is then.

889
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:41,797
These, gentlemen,
are £2,000 bundles.

890
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:43,753
That's two.

891
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:46,592
That's four.

892
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:48,910
<i>We settled on £16,000.</i>

893
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,151
<i>He had a lot more in the suitcase,
but it was better than nothing.</i>

894
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:54,354
...make eight.

895
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:01,635
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

896
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,433
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure
haggling with you.

897
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:05,873
Fucking better be.

898
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:10,275
Okay?

899
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:13,872
Yes!

900
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:19,074
<i>Just for a moment
it felt really great.</i>

901
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:22,556
<i>Like we were all in it together,
like friends, like it meant something.</i>

902
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:25,029
<i>A moment like that,
it can touch you deep inside.</i>

903
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:28,157
<i>That doesn't last long. Not like £16,000.</i>

904
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:31,277
What about you, Spud?
Any major investments on the horizon?

905
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:34,636
Going to buy yourself an island?
For fucking £4,000?

906
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:37,678
One palm tree, a couple of rocks
and a fucking sewage outflow.

907
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:41,673
I don't know, man.

908
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,910
I'm going to get something for my ma.

909
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:47,552
Get some good speed, no bicarb.

910
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:50,430
Then get a girl, take her out, treat her right.

911
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:54,195
- And shag her senseless?
- No, man, true love. True love.

912
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:58,828
But I could really handle some hot sex
with a Jewish princess tonight.

913
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:01,115
- You daft cunt.
- Or a Catholic.

914
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:04,476
If you're going to waste it on a bird,
you might as well leave it all to me.

915
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:06,676
- Now get the drinks in.
- I got a round already.

916
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:09,513
I got the last one.
It's your round, Franco.

917
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:12,398
Okay. Same again?

918
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:13,435
Right.

919
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:15,078
I'm off for a piss.

920
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:17,595
See when I get back that money's still here.

921
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:19,830
The moment your back's turned
we're out the door.

922
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:23,549
- I'll be right fucking after you.
- You'll never catch us, you flabby bastard.

923
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:25,717
By the way, see, when I get back...

924
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:28,753
We'll be halfway down the street
with the money.

925
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:32,355
I'd fucking kill you.
I thought you might, Franco.

926
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:34,112
Thought you might.

927
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:39,872
Are you game for it?

928
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:41,269
What?

929
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:44,674
Well?

930
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:47,239
Are you serious?

931
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:57,878
I don't know. What do you think?

932
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:01,992
- Still here, I see.
- We wouldn't run out on a mate.

933
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:04,194
Why not, I know I would.

934
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:07,153
Where's Franco?

935
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:13,313
For fuck's sake!
Sorry. I'll buy you another.

936
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:16,631
You've ruined my fucking suit,
you fucking idiots.

937
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:18,073
Sorry. I didn't mean it.

938
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:20,276
Sorry is not going to dry me off, you cunt.

939
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:23,113
Cool down, Franco.
The man says he's sorry.

940
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:25,515
Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.

941
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:26,635
Fuck you.

942
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:30,030
If you can't hold a pint
you shouldn't be in the pub. Now, fuck off.

943
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:46,918
No, Frank, don't do it, man.

944
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,275
Oh, fuck's sake.

945
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:52,155
Fucking nice one, Franco.
Shut it.

946
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:55,471
You cut me, man.
You were in my fucking way.

947
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:56,754
Help!

948
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:02,313
Anybody else want
to get in my fucking way?

949
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:03,829
You?

950
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:07,149
You?

951
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:13,314
Hey, Rent-boy.

952
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:17,069
You bring me down
a fucking smoke.

953
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:20,277
We'd better go.
I've got to go to the hospital.

954
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:23,477
You're not going to any hospital.
You're staying there.

955
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:28,751
You bring me down a fucking cigarette.

956
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:36,519
And the bag.

957
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:01,472
<i>Now I've justified this to myself
in all sorts of ways.</i>

958
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:04,314
<i>It wasn't a big deal,
just a minor betrayal.</i>

959
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,231
<i>Or we'd outgrown each other,
you know, that sort of thing.</i>

960
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:11,995
<i>But let's face it, I ripped them off,
my so-called mates.</i>

961
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:14,435
<i>But, Begbie,
I couldn't give a shit about him.</i>

962
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:18,150
<i>Sick Boy would have done the same to me
if he'd only thought of it first.</i>

963
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:24,072
<i>And Spud, okay, I felt sorry for Spud.
He never hurt anybody.</i>

964
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:31,359
Bastard!

965
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:39,873
Bastard!

966
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:53,039
Open up now!

967
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:56,314
Bastard!

968
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,678
<i>So, why did I do it?</i>

969
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:02,478
<i>I could offer a million answers, all false.</i>

970
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:04,596
<i>The truth is that I'm a bad person.</i>

971
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:07,877
<i>But that is going to change.
I'm going to change.</i>

972
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:09,951
<i>This is the last of that sort of thing.</i>

973
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:13,715
<i>Now I'm cleaning up and I'm moving on,
going straight and choosing life.</i>

974
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,070
<i>I'm looking forward to it already.</i>

975
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:18,151
<i>I'm going to be just like you.</i>

976
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:20,595
<i>The job, the family,
the fucking big television.</i>

977
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:24,309
<i>The washing machine, the car,
the compact disc, an electrical tin opener...</i>

978
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:26,868
<i>...good health, low cholesterol,
dental insurance...</i>

979
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:30,396
<i>...mortgage, starter home, leisure wear,
luggage, three-piece suite...</i>

980
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:34,792
<i>...DIY, game shows, junk food, children,
walks in the park, 9:00 to 5:00...</i>

981
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:38,316
<i>...good at golf, washing the car,
choice of sweaters, family Christmas...</i>

982
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:40,960
<i>...indexed pension, tax exemption,
clearing gutters...</i>

983
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:43,554
<i>...getting by, looking ahead,
the day you die.</i>
