1
00:02:07,056 --> 00:02:08,250
Bobby.

2
00:02:09,158 --> 00:02:10,353
Bobby.

3
00:02:11,194 --> 00:02:12,422
No!

4
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,404
All right, we lined up?

5
00:03:40,116 --> 00:03:41,777
Get that line.

6
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:52,189
Put the stern line on quick.

7
00:04:14,317 --> 00:04:15,750
Bobby!

8
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:21,613
Hey, baby!

9
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,560
Missed you.

10
00:04:37,073 --> 00:04:39,268
Hey, big man, how you doing?

11
00:04:46,349 --> 00:04:48,715
- Hey, Murph!
- Hey, Ethel.

12
00:04:49,018 --> 00:04:50,815
How you doing? Welcome home.

13
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,215
- You seen Deb and my boy?
- No, I'm sorry.

14
00:04:53,423 --> 00:04:54,447
Ma!

15
00:04:56,692 --> 00:04:59,126
- How you doing, beautiful?
- Hello, Bobby.

16
00:05:01,297 --> 00:05:02,787
Home safe.

17
00:05:10,306 --> 00:05:11,432
Who's that?

18
00:05:13,042 --> 00:05:15,033
- Ol' Ben.
- No.

19
00:05:16,012 --> 00:05:17,479
Poor old guy.

20
00:05:18,781 --> 00:05:19,975
Hey, Linda.

21
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,943
- Hey, boss.
- What's the score?

22
00:05:26,189 --> 00:05:27,417
My kind of numbers.

23
00:05:27,623 --> 00:05:29,989
I lost Ben Pulley.
He passed away onboard.

24
00:05:32,462 --> 00:05:34,089
Sorry to hear that.

25
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,954
How'd you hit it, Billy?

26
00:05:38,668 --> 00:05:40,363
Didn't hit very hard, did you?

27
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,562
We all have slumps, but you're overdue
to break out of yours.

28
00:05:43,773 --> 00:05:46,241
Did you hear the lady?
Ben Pulley's dead.

29
00:05:46,442 --> 00:05:50,845
That old man pickled himself to death
drinking 7& 7s chasing Narragansetts.

30
00:05:51,047 --> 00:05:55,279
Linda, with Ben, it was never
a question of "if," but "when."

31
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:57,818
- I'll bury him.
- I'll pay for it.

32
00:05:58,221 --> 00:05:59,711
See, you got what you wanted.

33
00:06:00,256 --> 00:06:03,453
Bring in your fish.
It shouldn't take too long.

34
00:07:27,343 --> 00:07:29,038
8-5.

35
00:07:35,318 --> 00:07:36,683
4-7-5.

36
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,198
Murph.

37
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,800
Sign my ledger.

38
00:08:04,714 --> 00:08:05,942
Shatford.

39
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,474
Sign my ledger.

40
00:08:13,923 --> 00:08:14,912
What's the matter?

41
00:08:15,124 --> 00:08:16,989
It's $2221.
Aren't we a little short?

42
00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:22,862
We were sharing up last night.
I thought it'd be three plus.

43
00:08:25,768 --> 00:08:30,501
You stocked 21,000 pounds at 3.50
a pound. That comes to $ 73,000.

44
00:08:30,773 --> 00:08:35,369
Minus $35,000 for bait, tackle, fuel.
That comes out to $38,500.

45
00:08:35,678 --> 00:08:37,202
I get half. I own the boat.

46
00:08:37,413 --> 00:08:40,246
Your captain takes double share,
four crewmen get a share each.

47
00:08:40,449 --> 00:08:43,077
And a rookie like you,
three-quarters share.

48
00:08:43,286 --> 00:08:46,346
That comes to $2221.

49
00:08:46,989 --> 00:08:48,388
What it is, is what it is.

50
00:08:48,858 --> 00:08:50,257
Sign the ledger.

51
00:08:56,999 --> 00:08:58,159
Moran.

52
00:09:02,471 --> 00:09:04,701
You going out again this season,
skipper?

53
00:09:04,907 --> 00:09:06,067
Why?

54
00:09:07,543 --> 00:09:08,908
You got a site in Florida?

55
00:09:11,514 --> 00:09:12,947
Bradenton Beach.

56
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,415
<i>The Cecile.</i>

57
00:09:16,852 --> 00:09:18,752
Pack your shit and get out.

58
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:21,856
You like Florida?

59
00:09:23,025 --> 00:09:25,550
Well, it beats the Grand Banks
in October.

60
00:09:26,228 --> 00:09:29,493
It gets rough up here,
Dougie likes the sun down there.

61
00:09:30,433 --> 00:09:32,628
Or he thinks he'll score better
with another captain.

62
00:09:33,002 --> 00:09:34,060
I didn't say that.

63
00:09:34,704 --> 00:09:36,069
Yes, you did.

64
00:09:37,873 --> 00:09:38,862
Goodbye.

65
00:09:40,076 --> 00:09:44,911
Here's your cut. $5923.76.
Sign the ledger.

66
00:09:46,082 --> 00:09:48,209
That's a record low for you,
isn't it?

67
00:09:48,684 --> 00:09:51,881
Next time, track Linda.
She'll take you where the fish are.

68
00:09:52,888 --> 00:09:55,049
You're getting to be rude, you know?

69
00:09:55,391 --> 00:09:57,882
I like you, Billy.
I always have.

70
00:09:58,094 --> 00:09:59,561
But I like my boat better.

71
00:09:59,762 --> 00:10:02,822
If you can't make it pay,
I'll find somebody who can.

72
00:10:03,332 --> 00:10:05,163
You trying to put a charge up my ass?

73
00:10:06,168 --> 00:10:07,965
You're on a cold streak.

74
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,070
I'm encouraging you
to catch fish.

75
00:10:10,272 --> 00:10:12,706
I'll bring you more fish
than you ever dreamed of.

76
00:10:12,908 --> 00:10:15,604
Next time I fish the Grand Banks,
they won't be so grand.

77
00:10:15,811 --> 00:10:17,779
You just struck out
on the Grand Banks.

78
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,072
Then I'll go further.

79
00:10:21,384 --> 00:10:23,944
Don't even think about it.
I want my boat back.

80
00:10:24,153 --> 00:10:26,053
And I want to catch some fish.

81
00:10:26,255 --> 00:10:27,244
It's what I do.

82
00:10:27,957 --> 00:10:28,946
Not lately.

83
00:10:29,158 --> 00:10:31,524
Want to yank my site, you go ahead.

84
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,714
- Murph.
- Hey, skip.

85
00:10:55,885 --> 00:10:58,683
What are you doing out here?
Get in there. Get drunk.

86
00:10:59,355 --> 00:11:01,050
Waiting on my ex...

87
00:11:01,624 --> 00:11:02,955
...and my son.

88
00:11:07,463 --> 00:11:10,057
Give him lots of
hugs and kisses tonight.

89
00:11:10,966 --> 00:11:13,730
You don't gotta remind me
to do that, skip.

90
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,804
Ladies, you're looking fine.
How you doing?

91
00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:22,500
Can I buy you a drink?
What, what, what?

92
00:11:29,351 --> 00:11:30,818
Hey, rookie.

93
00:11:32,888 --> 00:11:34,515
What are you so happy about?

94
00:11:35,658 --> 00:11:38,786
It wasn't exactly a slammer
up on the Grand Banks.

95
00:11:38,994 --> 00:11:40,586
Isn't it past your bedtime?

96
00:11:42,498 --> 00:11:44,227
Bugs, how you making out?

97
00:11:44,433 --> 00:11:45,832
I'm not.

98
00:11:48,037 --> 00:11:50,471
I don't know.
Maybe I smell like fish.

99
00:11:50,673 --> 00:11:53,972
- You need a new deodorant.
- Maybe I need a new face.

100
00:11:57,079 --> 00:11:59,377
Frickin' Alfred Pierre.

101
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:04,542
They were upstairs, they come down,
a little refreshment.

102
00:12:04,753 --> 00:12:06,653
Now they're going back up again.

103
00:12:06,856 --> 00:12:09,518
Half an hour ago, they shook
the lamps over the bar.

104
00:12:09,725 --> 00:12:13,456
Last time she brought her sister.
You should've seen the lamps then.

105
00:12:15,431 --> 00:12:17,296
How do he do it, mon?

106
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,298
I think he's fishin'
with a longer pole, Bugs.

107
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,438
What happened?

108
00:12:32,648 --> 00:12:36,778
They had a sale on kids' shoes
at Ames.

109
00:12:36,986 --> 00:12:38,180
Sorry.

110
00:12:39,555 --> 00:12:40,954
No problem.

111
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:42,721
Hi.

112
00:12:43,425 --> 00:12:44,687
Hello.

113
00:12:47,563 --> 00:12:49,292
So you want to have a drink?

114
00:12:52,067 --> 00:12:53,159
Come on, Debra.

115
00:12:53,369 --> 00:12:55,360
What do you say, for old times' sake?

116
00:12:55,571 --> 00:12:57,732
It was the old times that killed us.

117
00:13:00,442 --> 00:13:01,739
Is that what it was?

118
00:13:05,347 --> 00:13:06,609
There you go.

119
00:13:07,383 --> 00:13:09,851
I'm a little short.
It wasn't exactly a slammer.

120
00:13:10,819 --> 00:13:11,808
Half for you.

121
00:13:13,923 --> 00:13:14,912
You sure?

122
00:13:15,124 --> 00:13:16,250
Yeah, I'm working.

123
00:13:22,031 --> 00:13:23,396
Want to come with your daddy?

124
00:13:25,401 --> 00:13:26,800
Shoot some pool?

125
00:13:29,204 --> 00:13:30,671
Have a drink?

126
00:13:36,579 --> 00:13:38,638
Just bring him home in an hour.

127
00:13:58,067 --> 00:13:59,830
Good shot, buddy.

128
00:14:00,135 --> 00:14:02,763
All right, Sully, you think about it.

129
00:14:02,972 --> 00:14:04,064
All right?

130
00:14:07,443 --> 00:14:09,035
Bugs.

131
00:14:11,213 --> 00:14:12,475
Murph, come here.

132
00:14:12,681 --> 00:14:15,582
Here comes your fearless leader,
Captain Billy Tyne.

133
00:14:15,784 --> 00:14:18,582
I got a feeling skipper's
coming to give us bad news.

134
00:14:20,189 --> 00:14:22,589
Lady's not only pretty, she's smart.

135
00:14:24,627 --> 00:14:26,322
Yeah, we're going back out.

136
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:28,428
What'd I tell you?

137
00:14:30,165 --> 00:14:32,190
- When?
- A few days.

138
00:14:32,401 --> 00:14:33,595
"Few" means two?

139
00:14:34,169 --> 00:14:35,193
Two days is right.

140
00:14:35,404 --> 00:14:37,065
Skip, we just got back in.

141
00:14:37,272 --> 00:14:39,900
You don't want your site,
a replacement's a call away.

142
00:14:43,045 --> 00:14:45,343
Join me, don't join me.

143
00:14:45,748 --> 00:14:48,478
<i>There's time for one last shot.
The Andrea Gail will take it.</i>

144
00:14:48,684 --> 00:14:52,245
This time I promise you, we'll
come back with a shitload of fish.

145
00:14:52,688 --> 00:14:54,383
Excuse me, men, madam.

146
00:15:00,329 --> 00:15:01,660
What are you gonna do?

147
00:15:02,164 --> 00:15:05,156
I'm gonna tell him to
stick his head up his ass.

148
00:15:05,401 --> 00:15:06,732
I'd like to hear that.

149
00:15:07,703 --> 00:15:08,727
Hear what?

150
00:15:08,937 --> 00:15:11,497
I'd like to hear you tell him
to stick it up his ass.

151
00:15:11,707 --> 00:15:12,969
Go on, Bob.

152
00:15:17,713 --> 00:15:21,444
Yeah, that's just how I'll tell him
as soon as we get back.

153
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:23,208
You're a bastard.

154
00:15:23,852 --> 00:15:26,082
Why? Why do I even love you?

155
00:15:26,288 --> 00:15:28,051
- Come on.
- No. Why? Why, Bobby?

156
00:15:28,557 --> 00:15:31,492
When you get the answer, tell me.
I could use it myself.

157
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,656
- Get laid, Bugsy.
- Easy for you to say.

158
00:15:43,972 --> 00:15:45,269
Go on up there.

159
00:15:45,474 --> 00:15:47,271
Don't make the same mistake I did.

160
00:15:57,453 --> 00:15:59,444
You're going away again?

161
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,121
Yeah.

162
00:16:03,726 --> 00:16:05,751
Take me with you.

163
00:16:09,732 --> 00:16:10,994
Come here.

164
00:16:14,369 --> 00:16:15,358
Go back, Bobby.

165
00:16:16,438 --> 00:16:18,929
Go back to what you did before.

166
00:16:19,141 --> 00:16:22,167
- Pack cod, repair tackle.
- I'm sick of that.

167
00:16:22,644 --> 00:16:24,168
It's safe and it pays.

168
00:16:25,047 --> 00:16:26,412
Not enough.

169
00:16:27,049 --> 00:16:29,108
Just one more time. I promise.

170
00:16:29,384 --> 00:16:32,080
I have to try it again.
We need the money, baby.

171
00:16:32,287 --> 00:16:34,881
Money. It's always about the money.

172
00:16:35,758 --> 00:16:39,888
Well, I got a divorce lawyer,
a mountain of debt.

173
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:44,831
And there's your two kids.
You gotta get them back.

174
00:16:47,169 --> 00:16:48,966
Do you think you'll love them?

175
00:16:49,338 --> 00:16:51,067
They're yours, aren't they?

176
00:17:10,926 --> 00:17:12,416
Hey, beautiful.

177
00:17:12,728 --> 00:17:13,854
Yeah, you.

178
00:17:14,997 --> 00:17:16,521
Buy you a drink?

179
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,394
Seeing as I got two in front of me,
I don't think so.

180
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,295
I'm not very observant, am I?

181
00:17:24,606 --> 00:17:27,905
I got a feeling, yeah,
along with a lot of other things.

182
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,873
Why don't we start over?

183
00:17:31,113 --> 00:17:34,241
You know what would look good on you?
Me.

184
00:17:37,352 --> 00:17:38,614
No good?

185
00:17:42,624 --> 00:17:44,990
Have a drink. It's not that bad.

186
00:17:47,529 --> 00:17:49,520
Thank you. Here's to crime.

187
00:17:56,038 --> 00:17:57,630
You're pathetic.

188
00:18:00,943 --> 00:18:02,706
You still want to be a fisherman?

189
00:18:02,911 --> 00:18:05,505
Who told you I wanted to be
a fisherman?

190
00:18:05,881 --> 00:18:07,280
You want to come with me.

191
00:18:07,482 --> 00:18:10,918
I want to come with you,
but I don't want to be a fisherman.

192
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:17,383
You know, buddy...

193
00:18:19,695 --> 00:18:23,290
...one of these days your mom's
gonna find you a new dad.

194
00:18:23,498 --> 00:18:25,728
I don't want a new dad.

195
00:18:25,934 --> 00:18:27,094
I'm sorry.

196
00:18:27,302 --> 00:18:30,066
Your mom can't sit around
by herself all the time.

197
00:18:30,672 --> 00:18:32,606
She isn't sitting around.

198
00:18:49,858 --> 00:18:51,849
I'm sure he's a good guy.

199
00:18:52,961 --> 00:18:56,397
I know your mom wouldn't take up
with anybody but a good guy.

200
00:19:00,269 --> 00:19:01,827
And you know, buddy...

201
00:19:02,537 --> 00:19:05,768
...the most important thing is
that you and Mommy are happy.

202
00:19:07,142 --> 00:19:10,236
Can we talk about something else now?

203
00:19:21,757 --> 00:19:23,884
I miss you too, buddy.

204
00:19:30,098 --> 00:19:32,464
I miss you so damn much.

205
00:19:34,202 --> 00:19:36,966
What'd you say your name was again?

206
00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:39,564
Irene. Is that so tough?

207
00:19:39,775 --> 00:19:41,470
I'm sorry. Listen.

208
00:19:42,911 --> 00:19:44,970
Could I maybe take you home?

209
00:19:45,981 --> 00:19:46,970
I don't think so.

210
00:19:48,116 --> 00:19:52,314
I came to watch the game. Instead I
got schnockered with Bugsy.

211
00:19:54,056 --> 00:19:56,820
- What does Bugsy stand for anyway?
- Michael.

212
00:19:57,426 --> 00:19:59,826
That's a nice name.
Why don't you use it?

213
00:20:00,262 --> 00:20:01,923
Because people know me as Bugsy.

214
00:20:04,499 --> 00:20:06,990
I'm gonna shove off now.
Big day tomorrow.

215
00:20:07,202 --> 00:20:09,727
I can't take you home?

216
00:20:09,938 --> 00:20:11,633
What, in a wheelbarrow?

217
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,740
Crew guys like you never have cars.

218
00:20:13,942 --> 00:20:16,570
Lay off. I got feelings too.

219
00:20:16,778 --> 00:20:19,713
Where, down in your pants?

220
00:20:21,016 --> 00:20:24,179
Jesus, lady, where's the passion
in your life?

221
00:20:24,386 --> 00:20:26,411
Home in bed.

222
00:20:26,688 --> 00:20:29,054
One of them's 6, the other one's 8.

223
00:20:30,726 --> 00:20:33,889
All I can say is,
there's some lucky kids.

224
00:20:34,696 --> 00:20:36,061
They got a wonderful mother.

225
00:20:41,803 --> 00:20:43,896
You're not messing with me, are you?

226
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,373
Haven't got time.
We're going out in two days.

227
00:20:50,045 --> 00:20:52,377
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, Michael.

228
00:20:53,915 --> 00:20:55,280
Gotta go.

229
00:20:56,985 --> 00:20:58,350
What do you mean?

230
00:21:00,555 --> 00:21:02,216
- Where you going?
- Have these.

231
00:21:02,424 --> 00:21:04,085
- Thank you.
- See you.

232
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,123
- Bye, Ethel.
- See you.

233
00:21:28,216 --> 00:21:29,240
Watch your step.

234
00:21:39,327 --> 00:21:41,158
I smell Coppertone.

235
00:21:41,363 --> 00:21:43,331
That means that
Captain Linda Greenlaw...

236
00:21:43,532 --> 00:21:46,797
...a lady vain about her nose,
is in my wheelhouse.

237
00:21:47,002 --> 00:21:48,367
Make that Hawaiian Tropic.

238
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,663
At least I got the nose right.

239
00:21:51,807 --> 00:21:54,469
Your guys are loading bait
and groceries.

240
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:58,579
- You doing a turnaround?
- No rest for the weary.

241
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,010
There you go.
Flaunting your work ethic.

242
00:22:01,349 --> 00:22:03,510
I don't have a work ethic.
I just have work.

243
00:22:03,718 --> 00:22:05,618
If I'm gonna catch up to you.

244
00:22:06,688 --> 00:22:08,451
I love to watch you study charts.

245
00:22:08,657 --> 00:22:09,954
Why?

246
00:22:10,425 --> 00:22:11,892
You know them all by heart.

247
00:22:12,961 --> 00:22:15,794
What's special about today
that you're blowing smoke up my ass?

248
00:22:15,997 --> 00:22:17,328
I thought I'd make a pass.

249
00:22:21,236 --> 00:22:24,899
You see, I'm looking for a guy
to come home to Maine with me...

250
00:22:25,107 --> 00:22:26,574
...buy a house and raise kids.

251
00:22:26,775 --> 00:22:28,709
What does that guy and you do after?

252
00:22:30,212 --> 00:22:33,477
The thing is, I'm happy.
I'm happy I'm fit to do this.

253
00:22:33,682 --> 00:22:35,809
I just don't see the romance in it.

254
00:22:36,051 --> 00:22:38,918
But you've got it, Captain Greenlaw.

255
00:22:39,387 --> 00:22:41,082
You do. Believe me.

256
00:22:41,289 --> 00:22:43,052
I've seen them come and go.

257
00:22:43,258 --> 00:22:46,750
The day I laid eyes on you, I said,
"She's gonna be a good one."

258
00:22:47,395 --> 00:22:49,295
You can't be good unless you love it.

259
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:53,630
The fog's just lifting.

260
00:22:55,003 --> 00:22:57,528
You throw off your bow line,
throw off your stern.

261
00:22:59,107 --> 00:23:01,007
You head out the South Channel...

262
00:23:01,209 --> 00:23:04,440
...past Rocky Neck,
Ten Pound Island...

263
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:08,577
...past Niles Pond,
where I skated as a kid.

264
00:23:09,384 --> 00:23:10,544
Blow your horn...

265
00:23:10,752 --> 00:23:13,812
...and wave to the lighthouse
keeper's kid on Thatcher Island.

266
00:23:14,756 --> 00:23:16,314
Then the birds show up.

267
00:23:16,525 --> 00:23:18,083
Black-backs...

268
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,227
...herring gulls, big dump ducks.

269
00:23:23,064 --> 00:23:24,554
The sun hits you.

270
00:23:24,766 --> 00:23:27,462
Head north, open up to 12.

271
00:23:28,537 --> 00:23:29,595
You're steaming now.

272
00:23:30,472 --> 00:23:33,441
The guys are busy,
you're in charge.

273
00:23:34,743 --> 00:23:37,974
You know what?
You're a goddamn swordboat captain.

274
00:23:41,183 --> 00:23:43,378
Is there anything better in the world?

275
00:23:56,731 --> 00:23:57,823
Sully.

276
00:24:01,069 --> 00:24:02,900
So what do you think?

277
00:24:07,242 --> 00:24:08,368
You been busy?

278
00:24:08,577 --> 00:24:09,976
Busy enough.

279
00:24:10,178 --> 00:24:12,840
I was working menhaden in Annisquam.

280
00:24:13,181 --> 00:24:15,172
But they laid off Labor Day.

281
00:24:15,817 --> 00:24:17,444
Mended nets over in Fairhaven.

282
00:24:17,652 --> 00:24:20,450
That's crap.
What's this you're doing now?

283
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:23,221
Helping out a friend.

284
00:24:23,425 --> 00:24:24,892
He paying you?

285
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,052
He's my friend.

286
00:24:31,466 --> 00:24:32,990
Murphy keep his site?

287
00:24:36,805 --> 00:24:38,500
You want this job or not?

288
00:24:40,408 --> 00:24:41,636
I do.

289
00:25:47,275 --> 00:25:50,210
Lord, did I do that?

290
00:25:52,747 --> 00:25:54,112
Yeah, you did.

291
00:25:55,216 --> 00:25:59,084
But I'm not completely blind.
I can still see out of the other one.

292
00:26:00,288 --> 00:26:01,585
Next time I should break a leg.

293
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:04,452
Then you can stay home
and collect disability.

294
00:26:04,893 --> 00:26:07,691
Think of all those
handicapped parking spaces.

295
00:26:11,066 --> 00:26:13,261
Tell me last night was worth it.

296
00:26:13,935 --> 00:26:15,698
I can't remember.

297
00:26:16,371 --> 00:26:18,896
Can't remember, my ass.

298
00:26:19,174 --> 00:26:21,472
No, I remember your ass.

299
00:26:23,712 --> 00:26:25,577
Last night was worth it.

300
00:26:26,581 --> 00:26:28,139
There's nothing like
sleeping with you.

301
00:26:29,951 --> 00:26:31,384
Just sleeping...

302
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,517
...lying next to you...

303
00:26:34,456 --> 00:26:36,287
...all warm and sweet.

304
00:26:37,058 --> 00:26:39,686
And me wishing the morning
would never come.

305
00:26:49,671 --> 00:26:51,229
Catching up.

306
00:26:56,344 --> 00:26:59,575
Oh, boy, oh, boy.
Look at that shiner.

307
00:26:59,781 --> 00:27:01,248
Come on, Murph, will you?

308
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:04,877
Good morning.
Where'd you get the mouse?

309
00:27:05,086 --> 00:27:06,986
Chris "Boom-Boom" Cotter.

310
00:27:09,657 --> 00:27:12,592
Put some hair around that hole,
I bet you could hit it.

311
00:27:13,628 --> 00:27:17,359
Not with a pool cue,
or any other pointed instrument.

312
00:27:19,801 --> 00:27:23,669
What do you know except to cut squid
and take them to bed with you?

313
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,636
Ethel, where you getting
your customers these days?

314
00:27:28,843 --> 00:27:30,435
The welfare office?

315
00:27:31,146 --> 00:27:33,376
Who gave you that scar, tough guy?

316
00:27:34,315 --> 00:27:36,146
Back off! Back off.

317
00:27:36,351 --> 00:27:37,477
Come on, swing it.

318
00:27:37,852 --> 00:27:39,285
You assholes!

319
00:27:41,556 --> 00:27:45,822
How you gonna act onboard if you're
already at each other's throats?

320
00:27:46,027 --> 00:27:47,085
All right, Ma.

321
00:27:49,264 --> 00:27:50,822
See you onboard.

322
00:27:55,637 --> 00:27:58,697
- Alfred Pierre, one for the road?
- No, tanks, Mom.

323
00:27:59,207 --> 00:28:02,506
"No, tanks, Mom."
Guy can't even speak good English.

324
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,837
Well, anyway, can I get you anything?

325
00:28:05,046 --> 00:28:06,377
Let's go, boys.

326
00:28:08,316 --> 00:28:10,614
I'll wait for you in the car, Bobby.

327
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,448
Catch fish, boys. Lots of them.
Full ahead.

328
00:28:15,657 --> 00:28:17,716
Hold down the fort, Quentin.

329
00:28:17,959 --> 00:28:19,290
Thanks, Q.

330
00:28:19,861 --> 00:28:20,987
Thanks, Ethel.

331
00:28:24,933 --> 00:28:26,400
Gotta go, Mom.

332
00:28:28,903 --> 00:28:30,666
The Grand Banks.

333
00:28:31,339 --> 00:28:32,567
I know.

334
00:28:32,774 --> 00:28:36,073
Grand Banks are no joke in October.
All right?

335
00:28:39,414 --> 00:28:40,745
Be careful.

336
00:29:19,621 --> 00:29:21,816
At least we'll get cancer together.

337
00:29:27,362 --> 00:29:29,523
I can't put it off any longer.

338
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:32,457
I'm not too big on goodbyes.

339
00:29:35,136 --> 00:29:38,867
Don't go, Bobby. I got a bad feeling.

340
00:29:40,341 --> 00:29:41,968
I've been thinking about it.

341
00:29:42,644 --> 00:29:45,010
Then for God's sake, don't go.

342
00:29:45,213 --> 00:29:47,181
I'll moonlight, I'll sell the car.

343
00:29:47,382 --> 00:29:49,407
We'll work nights, weekends.

344
00:29:49,617 --> 00:29:53,075
Whatever it takes, little by little,
we'll put something away.

345
00:29:59,427 --> 00:30:00,860
I gotta go.

346
00:30:09,971 --> 00:30:11,199
Michael.

347
00:30:28,356 --> 00:30:29,186
Irene.

348
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:31,324
Irene. I knew that.

349
00:30:35,363 --> 00:30:37,331
I just wanted to say goodbye.

350
00:30:38,833 --> 00:30:41,165
No one ever said goodbye to me before.

351
00:30:47,942 --> 00:30:49,204
Well, goodbye, Irene.

352
00:30:49,677 --> 00:30:50,541
Goodbye.

353
00:30:50,745 --> 00:30:53,305
I wish it were night so I could say,
"Good night, Irene."

354
00:30:56,584 --> 00:30:57,915
That'll come later.

355
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:03,652
Well, you gotta go.

356
00:31:04,459 --> 00:31:06,393
Come on, boys. Let's go.

357
00:31:19,273 --> 00:31:20,672
I love you.

358
00:31:21,542 --> 00:31:23,635
I will always love you, Christina.

359
00:33:03,578 --> 00:33:06,547
Pack it in there good.
We got more coming down.

360
00:33:07,115 --> 00:33:09,106
Did we get all them eggs up there?

361
00:33:20,695 --> 00:33:22,560
<i>We catching some fish</i>

362
00:33:24,031 --> 00:33:25,726
Is that gonna crap out again?

363
00:33:25,933 --> 00:33:27,195
Never!

364
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:06,101
Do you mind?

365
00:34:09,911 --> 00:34:12,106
Stinks in here, doesn't it?

366
00:34:12,947 --> 00:34:14,574
Not anymore.

367
00:34:26,561 --> 00:34:29,792
<i>Hi, Bobby:
You're somewhere out there...</i>

368
00:34:30,231 --> 00:34:33,200
<i>... on the deep blue, goddamn sea...</i>

369
00:34:33,835 --> 00:34:37,532
<i>... and I'm writing this on a box
of two semi-down pillows...</i>

370
00:34:37,738 --> 00:34:40,502
<i>... that I secretly bought for us
at Penney's.</i>

371
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:43,604
<i>And I'm smiling to myself because...</i>

372
00:34:43,811 --> 00:34:46,245
<i>... of the surprise I have
in store for you.</i>

373
00:34:46,948 --> 00:34:51,578
<i>I'm talking removal from our dungeon
in the Crow's Nest...</i>

374
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,581
<i>... to our own place.</i>

375
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:58,520
<i>It's no great shakes...</i>

376
00:34:58,726 --> 00:35:01,752
<i>... but you gotta begin
with a baby shake, right?</i>

377
00:35:04,298 --> 00:35:06,163
<i>Forever love, Bobby.</i>

378
00:35:06,701 --> 00:35:08,999
<i>I'm in this for the long run.</i>

379
00:35:13,841 --> 00:35:16,935
- I'm not intruding, am I?
- You're not intruding.

380
00:35:17,445 --> 00:35:19,003
You're a natural.

381
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,414
You've got some old salt
in your blood.

382
00:35:21,616 --> 00:35:22,708
Thanks.

383
00:35:25,286 --> 00:35:27,880
You're a happy man out here,
aren't you?

384
00:35:28,089 --> 00:35:29,522
Today, maybe.

385
00:35:30,291 --> 00:35:31,758
When do you get unhappy?

386
00:35:32,093 --> 00:35:33,617
The day we go home.

387
00:35:34,061 --> 00:35:36,461
Home? I thought the sea
was your home.

388
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,392
You got me there.

389
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:45,261
But if you were gonna pin me down...

390
00:35:46,774 --> 00:35:50,073
...I guess Pensacola, Florida is home.

391
00:35:50,278 --> 00:35:52,109
My ex lives there. Jodi.

392
00:35:52,313 --> 00:35:53,837
And my kids.

393
00:35:56,150 --> 00:36:00,177
I wasn't very good at doing things
the way they're supposed to be done.

394
00:36:00,388 --> 00:36:01,616
Wife.

395
00:36:02,623 --> 00:36:03,851
Kids.

396
00:36:04,292 --> 00:36:06,226
A house with things in it.
All that stuff.

397
00:36:06,894 --> 00:36:08,361
So why are you so happy?

398
00:36:09,463 --> 00:36:11,431
You just got me on a good day.

399
00:36:12,166 --> 00:36:14,361
I'm doing what I was made to do.

400
00:36:15,136 --> 00:36:17,764
And I got a feeling I'll do it
even better this time.

401
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,900
How about you?

402
00:36:22,843 --> 00:36:25,539
I got a woman I can't stand to be
more than two feet away from.

403
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,609
Congratulations.

404
00:36:29,016 --> 00:36:32,213
Then again, I love to fish.

405
00:36:37,124 --> 00:36:38,921
Son, you've got a problem.

406
00:36:39,427 --> 00:36:40,689
I know.

407
00:36:56,577 --> 00:36:57,771
Here you are.

408
00:37:06,253 --> 00:37:10,053
What do you think? Blue skies,
scattered showers, same old, same old?

409
00:37:10,257 --> 00:37:12,248
- Your guess is as good as mine.
- Or better.

410
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,791
Watch it.

411
00:37:16,998 --> 00:37:18,795
This doesn't look good.

412
00:37:25,106 --> 00:37:26,937
Looks pretty ugly here too.

413
00:37:27,975 --> 00:37:29,067
Pam.

414
00:37:30,544 --> 00:37:33,945
Tell Bernie I need two graphics:
Bermuda and Sable Island.

415
00:37:53,167 --> 00:37:54,498
Good.

416
00:37:55,736 --> 00:37:57,169
What's our course?

417
00:37:57,371 --> 00:38:00,499
I've been sailing 42 years.
Never plotted a course.

418
00:38:01,609 --> 00:38:03,736
I set the compass, I ride it...

419
00:38:03,944 --> 00:38:06,242
...we'll be in Bermuda in no time.

420
00:38:49,623 --> 00:38:50,715
Let's go fishing.

421
00:38:52,626 --> 00:38:54,526
All right, guys, let's hit it!

422
00:38:55,896 --> 00:39:00,230
1000 hooks in the water before dinner.
I want 40 miles out there.

423
00:39:07,641 --> 00:39:09,836
Three-mile buoy out!

424
00:39:10,044 --> 00:39:11,477
Yeah, baby.

425
00:39:20,254 --> 00:39:21,414
Set.

426
00:39:37,538 --> 00:39:39,301
Okay, Sully, put it out.

427
00:39:40,641 --> 00:39:42,336
Highflyer!

428
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:10,760
Hey, A.P.

429
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,068
May the force be with us.

430
00:40:14,275 --> 00:40:16,835
You want to play with lightsticks,
stick them up your ass.

431
00:40:17,044 --> 00:40:17,874
Easy, Murph.

432
00:40:18,078 --> 00:40:20,911
He's dead weight.
He's been screwing around all night.

433
00:40:21,115 --> 00:40:22,514
A juicer and a head.

434
00:40:22,716 --> 00:40:24,013
Cape Ann, bottom shelf.

435
00:40:24,218 --> 00:40:26,880
Yeah, well, your wife
didn't feel that way.

436
00:40:32,293 --> 00:40:34,158
Hey, knock it off!

437
00:40:34,361 --> 00:40:37,853
I'll head for land and the Newfies
will throw you both in jail!

438
00:40:38,065 --> 00:40:39,589
All right, cap.

439
00:40:40,334 --> 00:40:41,460
Give us some lights.

440
00:40:44,138 --> 00:40:45,503
Come on. Jesus.

441
00:40:45,706 --> 00:40:47,401
Shake, you guys.

442
00:40:47,942 --> 00:40:49,136
Shake!

443
00:41:00,221 --> 00:41:02,655
- Just let it go.
- Your day is coming.

444
00:41:02,856 --> 00:41:05,620
Whenever you're ready.
I'll be right up here.

445
00:41:05,926 --> 00:41:08,656
The job ain't hard enough
without this knucklehead.

446
00:41:36,223 --> 00:41:37,417
Let's go.

447
00:41:43,063 --> 00:41:44,860
We're gonna make some money.

448
00:41:46,667 --> 00:41:48,294
Let's go, boys!

449
00:41:50,404 --> 00:41:52,031
Let's go! Come on!

450
00:42:10,491 --> 00:42:11,685
Come on.

451
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,307
Do it, skip, do it.

452
00:42:35,182 --> 00:42:36,410
Make a killing.

453
00:42:38,185 --> 00:42:39,413
One's on.

454
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,778
Fish on.

455
00:42:45,259 --> 00:42:46,692
Have those gaffs ready.

456
00:42:46,894 --> 00:42:49,294
Don't lose him, Murph.
Don't lose him.

457
00:42:51,365 --> 00:42:52,855
Pull him in, Murph.

458
00:42:59,306 --> 00:43:01,740
All right, now, gaff him. Gaff him!

459
00:43:09,116 --> 00:43:10,708
One, two, three!

460
00:43:26,967 --> 00:43:28,093
Pull him in.

461
00:43:39,246 --> 00:43:41,009
Come on, a little bit more.

462
00:43:47,254 --> 00:43:49,017
So what do you think?

463
00:43:49,289 --> 00:43:50,688
Do you think he'll like it?

464
00:43:50,891 --> 00:43:52,518
He'll love it.

465
00:43:54,061 --> 00:43:55,926
Enough to live with me in it?

466
00:43:56,930 --> 00:44:00,161
By now, honey, you know him
much better than I do.

467
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:04,169
We're gonna make a go of it.

468
00:44:08,308 --> 00:44:10,105
I got confidence in you.

469
00:44:11,712 --> 00:44:13,646
What, are you putting me on?

470
00:44:16,517 --> 00:44:18,382
He's my precious boy.

471
00:44:19,453 --> 00:44:21,318
And you're the woman for him.

472
00:44:23,891 --> 00:44:26,189
That's something I don't joke about.

473
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:33,022
<i>The activity down near Bermuda
is deepening rapidly.</i>

474
00:44:33,233 --> 00:44:35,428
<i>Given the warm and volatile
Gulf Stream...</i>

475
00:44:35,636 --> 00:44:40,198
<i>... it won't take much to turn
this tropical storm into a hurricane.</i>

476
00:44:40,407 --> 00:44:43,376
<i>This just in, video of Sable Island.</i>

477
00:45:31,191 --> 00:45:35,218
I put so much ground beef and sausage
in this, it weighed out at 20 pounds.

478
00:45:35,429 --> 00:45:37,294
More than most of our fish weigh.

479
00:45:37,498 --> 00:45:39,363
Skipper say anything about us
coming up short?

480
00:45:39,566 --> 00:45:41,090
He's too scared to say.

481
00:45:41,301 --> 00:45:43,326
Skipper don't get scared.

482
00:45:43,837 --> 00:45:45,031
Just disappointed.

483
00:45:46,206 --> 00:45:48,299
You know why this lasagna weighs
20 pounds?

484
00:45:49,276 --> 00:45:51,506
It tasted like you
threw in a shot put.

485
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:55,574
I once worked a site
with a guy like you.

486
00:45:56,350 --> 00:45:58,284
The guy had a real bad accident.

487
00:46:00,187 --> 00:46:03,281
Can't even keep track of them
with so many accidents at sea.

488
00:46:04,691 --> 00:46:06,659
Tough to get an ambulance too.

489
00:46:11,031 --> 00:46:12,225
Keep it up.

490
00:46:15,469 --> 00:46:17,164
Highflyer!

491
00:46:21,942 --> 00:46:24,342
A.P., give me a hand.

492
00:46:25,846 --> 00:46:28,314
Hey, how about a little hand
over here?

493
00:46:28,515 --> 00:46:30,983
You do your job, I'll do mine.

494
00:46:32,853 --> 00:46:34,445
Come on, guys.

495
00:46:36,256 --> 00:46:37,655
Came out here for nothing.

496
00:46:37,858 --> 00:46:39,917
Keep moving, keep moving.

497
00:46:42,195 --> 00:46:45,187
Come on, Sully, let's get
some bait going here.

498
00:47:02,749 --> 00:47:04,148
It's big.

499
00:47:04,351 --> 00:47:05,818
- Something very big.
- Fish on!

500
00:47:06,019 --> 00:47:07,179
Come on, guys.

501
00:47:07,387 --> 00:47:08,547
Oh, yeah.

502
00:47:08,755 --> 00:47:10,620
Come on. Bring it up.

503
00:47:24,404 --> 00:47:25,393
Bring it up.

504
00:47:29,076 --> 00:47:30,202
Get the gaff!

505
00:47:33,213 --> 00:47:34,578
Get it out of here!

506
00:47:34,781 --> 00:47:37,409
Stick him.
Stick it in his head! Good!

507
00:47:44,791 --> 00:47:46,053
Get him off!

508
00:47:47,294 --> 00:47:48,989
- He's got my leg!
- Hang on!

509
00:47:52,933 --> 00:47:55,868
Kick your foot out! Kick it!
Kick your foot out.

510
00:47:56,069 --> 00:47:57,297
Get back!

511
00:48:01,808 --> 00:48:04,106
All right, come on, get it out!

512
00:48:04,344 --> 00:48:05,368
Get it out of here.

513
00:48:06,446 --> 00:48:08,744
- Pull him back!
- Over the side.

514
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:11,517
You all right?

515
00:48:17,491 --> 00:48:19,459
You're short a boot, rookie!

516
00:48:21,128 --> 00:48:22,925
Beats a leg, don't it?

517
00:48:44,451 --> 00:48:48,285
Okay, we're getting a reading of winds
over 140 knots sustained.

518
00:48:48,488 --> 00:48:50,615
Looks like a category 5.

519
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:20,581
"Billy Tyne is no fine wine

520
00:49:22,155 --> 00:49:24,783
He's lost his touch with our long line

521
00:49:25,225 --> 00:49:28,786
Steamed here and there and all about

522
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:31,559
What's our tally?

523
00:49:32,032 --> 00:49:33,590
We've struck out"

524
00:49:39,506 --> 00:49:42,304
All right, okay.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

525
00:49:54,521 --> 00:49:57,081
Why aren't you downstairs
watching the movie?

526
00:49:58,358 --> 00:50:00,087
One of our three movies?

527
00:50:00,794 --> 00:50:02,421
I know them all by heart.

528
00:50:06,099 --> 00:50:07,498
Skip...

529
00:50:08,068 --> 00:50:10,696
...what are you gonna do
about those sets? They suck.

530
00:50:11,338 --> 00:50:13,067
We ain't doing nothing.

531
00:50:14,708 --> 00:50:16,300
The boys been talking?

532
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:18,637
About how I lost it?

533
00:50:20,113 --> 00:50:23,742
Billy Tyne's lost it? Gets a little
slow, they'll draw and quarter you.

534
00:50:24,885 --> 00:50:27,012
I just didn't think
you'd go along with it.

535
00:50:27,521 --> 00:50:31,321
I come here because I need the money.
I'm trying for a new start.

536
00:50:31,525 --> 00:50:33,857
Last trip I thought you had
something to offer.

537
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:36,187
But all in all,
you're just a little punk.

538
00:50:37,264 --> 00:50:41,030
- You promised me a shitload of fish!
- You'll get a shitload of fish.

539
00:50:41,234 --> 00:50:44,635
I've been in bad patches so many times
and came home with so much stock...

540
00:50:44,838 --> 00:50:47,671
...little boys like you had to
pack it on the pier.

541
00:50:47,874 --> 00:50:50,468
I always find the fish! Always!

542
00:50:50,677 --> 00:50:53,669
And I will this time!
So don't fuck with me!

543
00:50:55,882 --> 00:50:57,474
Aye, aye, skip.

544
00:51:12,966 --> 00:51:14,194
Put them closer!

545
00:51:14,801 --> 00:51:18,794
Murph, closer!
Give them a goddamn banquet.

546
00:51:19,005 --> 00:51:20,666
Aye, aye, cap.

547
00:51:21,441 --> 00:51:23,909
You heard him, boys.
Boss ain't happy.

548
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:25,577
Double-time.

549
00:51:27,614 --> 00:51:28,603
Let's go, Bob.

550
00:51:32,452 --> 00:51:33,578
Sullivan!

551
00:51:34,287 --> 00:51:36,812
I gotta hit you with a fish again
to get you to work?

552
00:51:37,023 --> 00:51:38,388
Lightsticks, now!

553
00:51:38,592 --> 00:51:40,355
Shut up, asshole!

554
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,824
You couldn't bait fish in a barrel!

555
00:51:44,097 --> 00:51:47,066
- Come on.
- See what I got to deal with?

556
00:51:47,267 --> 00:51:48,962
That's a landlubber.
What an idiot!

557
00:51:49,169 --> 00:51:52,195
Come on, Sully.
What are you, a fisherman or a farmer?

558
00:51:52,405 --> 00:51:53,997
Bugs, help him out.

559
00:51:54,207 --> 00:51:56,573
Hurry up, before the captain sees.

560
00:51:56,843 --> 00:52:00,040
Okay, sure, I'll help him out.
What a screwup!

561
00:52:00,247 --> 00:52:03,478
- You're useless, Sully!
- Lay off, Bugs. You never screw up?

562
00:52:03,683 --> 00:52:06,516
You're nothing but a pimple
on the ass of progress.

563
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,745
I've been on a better slab than this.

564
00:52:08,955 --> 00:52:10,582
I've had it with this.

565
00:52:19,766 --> 00:52:21,529
Take it easy.
It was an accident.

566
00:52:26,973 --> 00:52:30,238
You got the easiest job on the boat,
and you manage to screw it up!

567
00:52:30,443 --> 00:52:33,469
Kiss my ass, you little runt.
And you...!

568
00:52:35,949 --> 00:52:36,847
Murph!

569
00:52:40,887 --> 00:52:43,151
Cap, man overboard!

570
00:52:52,065 --> 00:52:53,794
Take the wheel!

571
00:53:10,383 --> 00:53:12,010
Back her down slow.

572
00:53:58,698 --> 00:54:00,222
Come on, Murph.

573
00:54:02,602 --> 00:54:04,229
We've got Murph!

574
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:14,642
Come on!

575
00:54:34,034 --> 00:54:36,002
You all right? You all right?

576
00:54:40,774 --> 00:54:42,036
Come on, Murph.

577
00:54:43,543 --> 00:54:44,601
Come on.

578
00:54:47,614 --> 00:54:48,774
Come on.

579
00:55:05,765 --> 00:55:07,562
How was the water, Murph?

580
00:55:07,767 --> 00:55:09,758
Welcome back, Murph!

581
00:55:13,173 --> 00:55:14,162
You did it, Murph.

582
00:55:21,147 --> 00:55:22,273
Hold on a minute.

583
00:55:28,488 --> 00:55:30,456
All right, bend over.

584
00:55:32,625 --> 00:55:33,614
Tetanus.

585
00:55:37,197 --> 00:55:39,062
Who's the hero?

586
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:41,567
Bobby and Sully.

587
00:55:42,836 --> 00:55:44,098
Sully?

588
00:55:49,175 --> 00:55:52,235
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dale Murphy out of Cortez, Florida.

589
00:55:52,445 --> 00:55:55,903
<i>The only fish the Andrea Gail has
hooked in three days.</i>

590
00:55:56,116 --> 00:55:57,481
How you feeling?

591
00:55:57,684 --> 00:55:58,844
All right.

592
00:56:00,253 --> 00:56:02,881
- Bobby, thank you.
- Don't worry about it.

593
00:56:06,192 --> 00:56:08,456
Sully was the first one to go in.

594
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:17,201
So I guess you're the big hero here.

595
00:56:18,004 --> 00:56:20,199
Well, you'd have done the same for me.

596
00:56:21,574 --> 00:56:23,201
Isn't that what I'm supposed to say?

597
00:56:25,945 --> 00:56:28,470
Well, you can say what you want...

598
00:56:29,382 --> 00:56:31,612
...but I'm glad you know how to swim.

599
00:56:32,285 --> 00:56:34,048
That's real big of you, Murph.

600
00:56:35,955 --> 00:56:37,445
It's all I can manage now.

601
00:56:38,992 --> 00:56:40,254
All right?

602
00:56:41,427 --> 00:56:42,860
I'll work on it.

603
00:56:48,468 --> 00:56:49,833
Tough guy.

604
00:57:00,346 --> 00:57:03,008
This weather fax just came in.

605
00:57:04,851 --> 00:57:06,944
Edie, have a look at this.

606
00:57:08,121 --> 00:57:11,784
We have got to head in now!
Put it in at Watch Hill!

607
00:57:11,991 --> 00:57:13,788
In this stuff, harbor's too dangerous.

608
00:57:13,993 --> 00:57:14,823
Dangerous?

609
00:57:15,028 --> 00:57:17,155
Dash into shore,
cut across shipping lanes...

610
00:57:17,363 --> 00:57:20,196
This is a hurricane
coming straight at us!

611
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,426
Let me reduce sails, Sandy,
or even go back home.

612
00:57:23,636 --> 00:57:24,694
This is my boat.

613
00:57:24,904 --> 00:57:27,737
We'll ride this thing out.
Not for fun, for safety.

614
00:57:27,941 --> 00:57:31,069
Do what I've always done:
Go with the flow.

615
00:57:47,093 --> 00:57:49,527
Holy shit! Rogue wave!

616
00:57:50,997 --> 00:57:52,328
Look out!

617
00:58:07,213 --> 00:58:08,202
Everybody here?

618
00:58:20,226 --> 00:58:23,389
Captain, the boys would like
to have a word with you.

619
00:58:26,633 --> 00:58:27,964
Take over.

620
00:58:48,121 --> 00:58:50,681
When this meeting's over,
straighten this crap up.

621
00:58:51,457 --> 00:58:53,015
So what's the word?

622
00:58:55,194 --> 00:58:57,924
We're starting to get
an unlucky feeling out here.

623
00:58:58,131 --> 00:59:00,861
Murph going over, the shark,
a rogue wave...

624
00:59:01,067 --> 00:59:02,056
Yeah, what else?

625
00:59:03,703 --> 00:59:07,662
Never mind unlucky.
We're just looking for some fish.

626
00:59:08,041 --> 00:59:11,875
We had slumps before, you and I,
but nothing like this.

627
00:59:12,078 --> 00:59:15,605
You boys look like you got busted
in a brawl in Scollay Square.

628
00:59:15,815 --> 00:59:18,045
That's how we feel.
We want to go home.

629
00:59:19,519 --> 00:59:23,615
You want to go home? You lonely for
that young mama who was all over you?

630
00:59:23,823 --> 00:59:25,848
My girl is none of your business.

631
00:59:26,059 --> 00:59:29,517
But you are. If you don't like it,
get the hell off! All of you.

632
00:59:32,865 --> 00:59:36,426
I look around and all I see are
little boys sitting on their asses...

633
00:59:36,636 --> 00:59:38,729
...too scared to go
and get some pay dirt.

634
00:59:38,938 --> 00:59:42,374
Pay dirt? What are you talking about?
Where the hell is that?

635
00:59:42,575 --> 00:59:43,974
We covered the Grand Banks.

636
00:59:44,344 --> 00:59:47,142
The Grand Banks are west of us.
I'm headed east.

637
00:59:48,648 --> 00:59:49,808
The Flemish Cap.

638
00:59:53,086 --> 00:59:54,713
The Flemish Cap?

639
00:59:55,288 --> 00:59:58,348
Why don't we steam to Portugal
while we're at it?

640
01:00:03,296 --> 01:00:05,662
So this is the moment of truth.

641
01:00:08,735 --> 01:00:11,067
This is where they separate
the men from the boys.

642
01:00:15,575 --> 01:00:16,803
How about it?

643
01:00:19,712 --> 01:00:21,543
- Are you Gloucestermen?
- Yeah.

644
01:00:21,748 --> 01:00:24,683
But why go all the way
to the Flemish Cap to prove it?

645
01:00:25,351 --> 01:00:26,909
Tell him, Alfred Pierre.

646
01:00:29,422 --> 01:00:31,014
That's where the fish are.

647
01:00:34,227 --> 01:00:35,819
Do we have any other choice?

648
01:00:36,496 --> 01:00:39,090
Yeah. Crawl home, busted.

649
01:00:47,306 --> 01:00:49,365
- All right, skip.
- All right.

650
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:51,904
All right.

651
01:00:58,217 --> 01:01:02,176
<i>Whiskey-Yankee-Charlie, 6-6-8- 1,
do you read me?</i>

652
01:01:02,388 --> 01:01:06,347
<i>This is Andrea Gail, Whiskey-
Yankee-Charlie, 6-6-8-1. Hey, Linda.</i>

653
01:01:07,059 --> 01:01:09,857
<i>What's happening?</i>

654
01:01:10,062 --> 01:01:11,529
<i>Slim to none. Where are you?</i>

655
01:01:11,931 --> 01:01:15,389
Tail of the Banks.
Kicking up something wicked here.

656
01:01:15,601 --> 01:01:16,898
Made a couple of sets.

657
01:01:17,103 --> 01:01:18,161
You doing any good?

658
01:01:18,371 --> 01:01:22,899
Nine, first set. Twelve...
No, make that a baker's dozen, second.

659
01:01:23,109 --> 01:01:25,202
<i>Got a couple of markers to boot.</i>

660
01:01:25,411 --> 01:01:28,209
Your hand is so hot,
I can feel the heat from here.

661
01:01:28,748 --> 01:01:32,184
<i>- I've asked you to team up.
- I don't like partners.</i>

662
01:01:32,385 --> 01:01:33,818
Business-wise, that is.

663
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:36,853
Okay, okay. What's your position?

664
01:01:37,056 --> 01:01:39,422
46 north, 48 west.

665
01:01:39,892 --> 01:01:41,416
You headed for the Flemish Cap?

666
01:01:41,627 --> 01:01:45,222
<i>The lady knows her coordinates.
Yeah, I'm steaming full-bore.</i>

667
01:01:45,431 --> 01:01:47,399
The Flemish Cap is
nearly off the charts.

668
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,295
What are you trying to prove?

669
01:01:49,502 --> 01:01:53,734
We got gale-force coming out
of Bermuda, stuff out of Sable Island.

670
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:56,738
<i>As for me, I'm staring here
at solid white chop.</i>

671
01:01:56,943 --> 01:01:58,604
This could be a triple-header.

672
01:01:59,011 --> 01:02:01,172
You're behind me.
So is your weather.

673
01:02:01,814 --> 01:02:04,942
Yeah, but you've gotta go
through it to get back.

674
01:02:05,751 --> 01:02:07,218
Good point.

675
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:10,389
Billy, you won't like this,
but I'm gonna say it anyway:

676
01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:12,055
You be careful.

677
01:02:12,258 --> 01:02:13,657
Yes, Mother.

678
01:02:16,095 --> 01:02:18,495
Why don't we pick this up later?
I'm out.

679
01:02:38,618 --> 01:02:41,086
- You guys use some company?
- Sure.

680
01:02:41,454 --> 01:02:43,388
- Coffee?
- Yeah, thanks.

681
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:48,324
<i>- In the mid-Atlantic,
moving rapidly northeast...</i>

682
01:02:48,528 --> 01:02:50,086
<i>... 30-foot waves.</i>

683
01:02:50,296 --> 01:02:51,388
What'd you hear?

684
01:02:51,597 --> 01:02:53,690
They're out on the Flemish Cap.

685
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:56,368
I got it straight from big Bob Brown.

686
01:02:57,970 --> 01:02:59,130
Yeah.

687
01:02:59,672 --> 01:03:01,367
The Flemish Cap.

688
01:03:02,441 --> 01:03:04,602
I went there, '62.

689
01:03:05,845 --> 01:03:07,437
Lots of fish.

690
01:03:08,614 --> 01:03:10,377
And lots of weather.

691
01:03:10,883 --> 01:03:12,077
Hurricanes...

692
01:03:12,318 --> 01:03:14,445
...squalls, huge seas.

693
01:03:14,654 --> 01:03:16,281
You're full of shit, Quentin.

694
01:03:18,057 --> 01:03:19,217
That's right.

695
01:03:20,192 --> 01:03:21,386
I am.

696
01:04:54,253 --> 01:04:57,711
- Where are you going?
- To point this boat up into the storm.

697
01:04:57,923 --> 01:04:59,788
And scream for help!

698
01:04:59,992 --> 01:05:03,758
We lie ahull, beam to the waves,
slip sideways. Standard procedure.

699
01:05:04,063 --> 01:05:07,794
Forget it, we won't make it!
Missy, get on the radio now!

700
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,558
- We can make it.
- Mayday!

701
01:05:09,769 --> 01:05:12,465
It's sopping wet!
She'll be weeping in the wind. No!

702
01:05:12,905 --> 01:05:15,203
We stay below and ride this thing out.

703
01:05:15,408 --> 01:05:17,376
Remember, this is my boat!

704
01:05:17,576 --> 01:05:19,601
This is my life!

705
01:05:19,812 --> 01:05:20,642
Go, Melissa!

706
01:05:25,651 --> 01:05:26,743
Mayday!

707
01:05:26,952 --> 01:05:28,647
Mayday! Mayday!

708
01:05:32,591 --> 01:05:35,788
<i>We're a 32-foot
sailing vessel, Mistral.</i>

709
01:05:36,328 --> 01:05:38,228
Our position is...

710
01:05:39,832 --> 01:05:41,322
...39.49 north...

711
01:05:43,436 --> 01:05:45,495
Mayday! Mayday!

712
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:48,800
Over.

713
01:06:18,437 --> 01:06:19,426
Hey, cap!

714
01:06:27,246 --> 01:06:29,043
Ice machine's had it.
It's dead.

715
01:06:31,650 --> 01:06:33,277
- Check the evaporator?
- Yeah.

716
01:06:34,286 --> 01:06:35,810
- Freon?
- Plenty, but nowhere to flow.

717
01:06:36,288 --> 01:06:37,550
Use some spit and glue.

718
01:06:37,823 --> 01:06:40,223
I did. She's fried, skip.

719
01:06:40,426 --> 01:06:42,087
I told Brown, get us a new one...

720
01:06:42,294 --> 01:06:44,660
...but he gets another overhaul,
son of a bitch!

721
01:06:49,668 --> 01:06:50,794
Sorry.

722
01:06:58,944 --> 01:07:00,571
The ice machine's gone.

723
01:07:02,581 --> 01:07:04,014
Oh, fuck.

724
01:07:11,757 --> 01:07:13,918
All right,
we got good ice on them now.

725
01:07:14,293 --> 01:07:15,920
We seal the fish hold.

726
01:07:16,128 --> 01:07:18,995
With luck, we'll deliver
the catch and set the market.

727
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,131
Pull up the gear.

728
01:07:24,236 --> 01:07:25,635
We're going home.

729
01:07:28,808 --> 01:07:31,572
Put these babies on ice,
and we're out of here!

730
01:07:51,163 --> 01:07:54,860
<i>We are taking heavy waves.
Damage on deck.</i>

731
01:07:57,469 --> 01:07:59,596
<i>Need immediate assistance.</i>

732
01:07:59,805 --> 01:08:03,172
<i>We're beam to the sea
and taking on water.</i>

733
01:08:03,375 --> 01:08:05,969
Just so you understand
what we're up against.

734
01:08:06,946 --> 01:08:11,440
We're looking at 40 to 50-foot waves,
gale-force winds. A real bad one.

735
01:08:11,650 --> 01:08:13,117
Right in our path.

736
01:08:13,886 --> 01:08:16,286
The Weather Service
is jerking off again.

737
01:08:16,488 --> 01:08:17,546
No.

738
01:08:18,691 --> 01:08:20,249
You're afraid?

739
01:08:20,593 --> 01:08:22,458
I never seen you scared.

740
01:08:23,262 --> 01:08:25,890
It's pretty rough stuff out there,
that's for sure.

741
01:08:27,032 --> 01:08:30,024
We either hang out here
for a few days till it calms down...

742
01:08:30,236 --> 01:08:31,328
But, cap...

743
01:08:31,604 --> 01:08:34,232
...we got 60,000 pounds of fish here.

744
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:36,203
Are we gonna let it spoil?

745
01:08:36,408 --> 01:08:39,434
I thought we were gonna
set the market, make a killing.

746
01:08:39,645 --> 01:08:42,341
Or we say the hell with it.

747
01:08:43,082 --> 01:08:44,982
We drive right through it.

748
01:08:53,092 --> 01:08:55,083
You said we're Gloucestermen.

749
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:02,658
What do you say, guys?

750
01:09:02,902 --> 01:09:04,563
Are we or aren't we?

751
01:09:05,771 --> 01:09:07,136
Did we come out here for nothing?

752
01:09:07,339 --> 01:09:09,705
- It's a lot of money.
- Let's make some money.

753
01:09:09,909 --> 01:09:12,878
Come on. Let's hear it, Gloucester!

754
01:09:13,946 --> 01:09:17,677
Let's get her lashed down.
Bugs, put the birds in the water.

755
01:09:17,883 --> 01:09:19,851
Birds in. Got it, skip.

756
01:09:28,527 --> 01:09:30,222
Look. Look at this.

757
01:09:31,297 --> 01:09:34,698
We got Hurricane Grace moving north
off the Atlantic seaboard.

758
01:09:35,301 --> 01:09:36,529
Huge...

759
01:09:36,735 --> 01:09:38,828
...getting massive.

760
01:09:39,038 --> 01:09:42,906
Two, this low south of Sable Island,
ready to explode.

761
01:09:43,842 --> 01:09:45,104
Look at this.

762
01:09:45,577 --> 01:09:50,037
Three, a fresh cold front
swooping down from Canada.

763
01:09:50,749 --> 01:09:52,944
But it's caught a ride
on the jet stream...

764
01:09:53,152 --> 01:09:55,916
...and is motoring hell-bent
towards the Atlantic.

765
01:09:56,555 --> 01:09:57,613
Cool.

766
01:09:57,890 --> 01:09:58,948
Wait, wait.

767
01:10:00,225 --> 01:10:02,693
What if Hurricane Grace
runs smack into it?

768
01:10:03,262 --> 01:10:07,528
Add to the scenario this baby off
Sable Island, scrounging for energy.

769
01:10:07,766 --> 01:10:11,361
She'll start feeding off
both the Canadian cold front...

770
01:10:11,804 --> 01:10:13,772
...and Hurricane Grace.

771
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:16,533
You could be a meteorologist
all your life...

772
01:10:20,042 --> 01:10:21,031
...and never see something like this.

773
01:10:21,243 --> 01:10:23,234
It would be a disaster
of epic proportions.

774
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:25,779
<i>It would be...</i>

775
01:10:25,981 --> 01:10:27,812
<i>... the perfect storm.</i>

776
01:10:39,295 --> 01:10:40,455
Let's get down below.

777
01:10:41,797 --> 01:10:42,821
Bobby?

778
01:10:43,666 --> 01:10:45,224
I want you up here with me.

779
01:11:00,749 --> 01:11:03,309
Mayday! Mayday!

780
01:11:07,923 --> 01:11:11,689
<i>Sailing vessel Mistral,
this is Coast Guard rescue.</i>

781
01:11:11,894 --> 01:11:13,088
Sandy!

782
01:11:15,865 --> 01:11:18,993
Edie, they heard me!
They're coming!

783
01:11:30,012 --> 01:11:32,003
<i>Air Force rescue 2-3- 1.</i>

784
01:11:32,214 --> 01:11:34,079
<i>We've located the Mistral.</i>

785
01:11:34,283 --> 01:11:36,615
<i>Position: 39.49 north...</i>

786
01:11:36,819 --> 01:11:38,980
<i>... 69.52 west.</i>

787
01:11:41,624 --> 01:11:43,182
How far's that last position?

788
01:11:43,392 --> 01:11:45,292
About 20.3 miles, captain.

789
01:11:45,494 --> 01:11:47,428
OD, boatswain on the bridge.

790
01:11:52,601 --> 01:11:54,125
Tallyho, there they are.

791
01:11:59,742 --> 01:12:02,575
- Okay, guys, showtime.
- You got it.

792
01:12:03,045 --> 01:12:04,910
<i>Mistral, this is 2-3-1.</i>

793
01:12:05,114 --> 01:12:08,379
We're gonna extract you
one at a time from the deck.

794
01:12:08,684 --> 01:12:10,948
Hey, Jeremy, I don't like this.

795
01:12:11,353 --> 01:12:14,686
- Clock's ticking.
- Come on, we better get them off now.

796
01:12:14,890 --> 01:12:15,948
Get closer, Darryl.

797
01:12:16,225 --> 01:12:17,522
Just a little closer.

798
01:12:22,665 --> 01:12:24,690
Okay, deploying the basket.

799
01:12:25,768 --> 01:12:27,292
Close to 2:00.

800
01:12:27,503 --> 01:12:28,731
Let's come right to 5.

801
01:12:29,405 --> 01:12:31,566
- Four. Three.
- Son of a bitch.

802
01:12:31,774 --> 01:12:33,674
Stop there. Hold your hover.

803
01:12:33,876 --> 01:12:35,104
Goddamn it!

804
01:12:35,311 --> 01:12:37,677
Keep it steady, keep it steady.

805
01:12:39,581 --> 01:12:40,639
Shit!

806
01:12:47,222 --> 01:12:48,689
Man out!

807
01:12:49,258 --> 01:12:51,488
- Shear the cable!
- No, I got it!

808
01:13:09,078 --> 01:13:10,067
Shit.

809
01:13:10,279 --> 01:13:11,837
Bring up the basket!

810
01:13:15,484 --> 01:13:16,746
Sandy!

811
01:13:17,653 --> 01:13:18,915
Hold on!

812
01:13:19,121 --> 01:13:20,418
I got you!

813
01:13:20,723 --> 01:13:23,214
- Basket's in.
- Looks like I'm going for a swim.

814
01:13:23,425 --> 01:13:24,585
Okay, go get them.

815
01:13:24,793 --> 01:13:26,488
Mitchell off intercom.

816
01:13:27,496 --> 01:13:28,929
It's time to get wet.

817
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:33,293
We're gonna be all right.

818
01:13:34,937 --> 01:13:35,926
Go.

819
01:14:11,573 --> 01:14:12,562
Altitude.

820
01:14:13,742 --> 01:14:15,835
Altitude. Get her up, get her up!

821
01:14:21,517 --> 01:14:22,745
He's in the water.

822
01:14:26,655 --> 01:14:28,282
I'm going after him!

823
01:14:28,490 --> 01:14:29,923
No, no, wait! Stand by!

824
01:14:32,194 --> 01:14:33,684
Jonesy, hold on.

825
01:14:42,671 --> 01:14:43,933
There! He's okay.

826
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:47,273
This isn't working.
They'll have to get in the water.

827
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:00,613
Come on, come on!

828
01:15:01,490 --> 01:15:03,014
You're having a blast, huh?

829
01:15:03,225 --> 01:15:06,490
- Want a turn?
- No, just watch. I want to watch.

830
01:15:06,695 --> 01:15:09,493
I'm studying up for the day
I get my own boat.

831
01:15:09,798 --> 01:15:11,493
Your own boat, huh?

832
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:14,168
Want to give me a hand?
Grab the throttle.

833
01:15:16,939 --> 01:15:18,304
Hang on.

834
01:15:21,376 --> 01:15:23,241
- Ah, shit!
- Seven K, six easy.

835
01:15:23,445 --> 01:15:25,003
- Eight minimum.
- Ten.

836
01:15:25,514 --> 01:15:28,813
You know, I'm gonna get me
a new used Ford F-150...

837
01:15:29,017 --> 01:15:31,042
...take a ride to Digby with Irene.

838
01:15:31,253 --> 01:15:35,451
Going to get drunk, eat like a pig
and sleep like a child!

839
01:15:35,657 --> 01:15:37,090
Fish and fun-gee!

840
01:15:40,496 --> 01:15:44,830
Okay, Jer, too risky to go lower.
You gotta jump from here.

841
01:16:01,150 --> 01:16:04,642
Good afternoon, madam.
I'm Sergeant Jeremy Mitchell.

842
01:16:04,853 --> 01:16:07,219
I'll be your para-rescue jumper today.

843
01:16:07,523 --> 01:16:09,013
How are you?

844
01:16:09,258 --> 01:16:10,782
Okay so far.

845
01:16:26,708 --> 01:16:29,734
Keep your hands
and feet in the basket.

846
01:16:33,849 --> 01:16:35,146
- Careful.
- Okay!

847
01:16:35,350 --> 01:16:37,011
All right, here we go.

848
01:16:44,293 --> 01:16:45,282
You're next.

849
01:16:56,972 --> 01:16:58,667
That was nothing!

850
01:16:59,141 --> 01:17:00,199
Come on!

851
01:17:14,590 --> 01:17:16,114
Oh, my God.

852
01:17:16,992 --> 01:17:18,516
It's happening.

853
01:17:56,298 --> 01:17:59,461
<i>Andrea Gail, Andrea Gail.
This is Hannah Boden.</i>

854
01:18:04,039 --> 01:18:05,233
- Billy, over.

855
01:18:06,975 --> 01:18:08,135
<i>Calling the Andrea Gail.</i>

856
01:18:14,616 --> 01:18:16,982
<i>Andrea Gail, do you read me?</i>

857
01:18:17,185 --> 01:18:19,415
Do you read me? Come in!

858
01:18:19,621 --> 01:18:23,717
Come in, for God's sake, come in!
Billy, these storms have collided!

859
01:18:23,925 --> 01:18:25,358
They are exploding!

860
01:18:27,829 --> 01:18:29,091
Who is it?

861
01:18:29,765 --> 01:18:30,595
I don't know.

862
01:18:30,799 --> 01:18:32,596
<i>Andrea Gail, come in!</i>

863
01:18:33,869 --> 01:18:36,997
Whiskey-Yankee-Charlie 6-6-8-1, over.

864
01:18:37,205 --> 01:18:38,695
Talk to me, Billy, over.

865
01:18:38,907 --> 01:18:41,273
I repeat,
Whiskey-Yankee-Charlie 6-6-8-1...

866
01:18:43,445 --> 01:18:45,879
Look at your fax, damn it!
Look at your fax!

867
01:18:46,081 --> 01:18:49,175
Whiskey-Yankee-Charlie 6-6-8-1, over!

868
01:18:49,384 --> 01:18:51,818
<i>- Where are you, Billy?
- Linda?</i>

869
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:53,214
Give me the coordinates.

870
01:18:53,422 --> 01:18:56,585
- 44 north, 56.4 west.
- We're 44 north...

871
01:18:56,792 --> 01:18:59,522
<i>... 56.4 west, headed west.</i>

872
01:18:59,995 --> 01:19:04,932
<i>I repeat, 44 north,
56.4 west, headed...</i>

873
01:19:05,801 --> 01:19:07,428
<i>Over.</i>

874
01:19:07,636 --> 01:19:10,161
Billy, get out of there.

875
01:19:10,706 --> 01:19:14,073
Come about! Let it carry you out!
What the hell are you doing?

876
01:19:14,276 --> 01:19:15,368
Hang on!

877
01:19:17,112 --> 01:19:20,411
Billy! Billy, for chrissake!

878
01:19:20,615 --> 01:19:24,210
You're steaming into a bomb!
Turn around, for chrissake!

879
01:19:26,621 --> 01:19:27,713
It's the antenna.

880
01:19:27,923 --> 01:19:30,153
Billy, can you hear me?

881
01:19:30,492 --> 01:19:34,087
You're headed right
for the middle of the monster.

882
01:19:43,705 --> 01:19:45,536
Oh, my God.

883
01:19:54,483 --> 01:19:55,541
Hang on!

884
01:19:57,252 --> 01:19:58,480
Take the wheel.

885
01:19:58,954 --> 01:20:00,353
No, I'll go.

886
01:20:02,424 --> 01:20:04,255
Mayday, mayday, mayday...

887
01:20:04,459 --> 01:20:06,188
...Coast Guard Boston.

888
01:20:07,062 --> 01:20:10,156
<i>This is fishing vessel Hannah Boden
relaying a mayday...</i>

889
01:20:10,365 --> 01:20:12,595
<i>...for swordboat Andrea Gail.</i>

890
01:20:12,868 --> 01:20:15,894
Last position, 44 north...

891
01:20:16,304 --> 01:20:19,705
...56.4 west, over.

892
01:20:20,742 --> 01:20:25,042
<i>Advise you proceed to next incident
at your discretion, over.</i>

893
01:20:25,247 --> 01:20:27,044
Yeah, roger, Boston.

894
01:20:27,249 --> 01:20:30,150
<i>I just got a mayday on a Gloucester
swordboat, the Andrea Gail.</i>

895
01:20:30,352 --> 01:20:34,812
44 north, 56.4 west, headed west.

896
01:20:35,223 --> 01:20:37,714
Jesus. That's straight into hell.

897
01:20:37,993 --> 01:20:40,894
Gloucester.
They're always from Gloucester.

898
01:20:41,096 --> 01:20:44,827
It's an increased-risk mission,
so, you know, it's up to us.

899
01:20:45,033 --> 01:20:47,194
I'm getting
a little air-to-air feeling.

900
01:20:47,402 --> 01:20:49,370
Refuel in hell?
That's pretty sporty.

901
01:20:49,771 --> 01:20:51,739
Call the cutter.
We're coming in hot.

902
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:55,007
People, slight change of plans!

903
01:20:55,444 --> 01:20:58,413
<i>We're gonna drop you on
the Coast Guard cutter Tamaroa.</i>

904
01:20:58,613 --> 01:21:01,707
We got some swordfishermen
who have lost their way.

905
01:21:03,285 --> 01:21:04,843
Or their minds.

906
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:48,186
<i>This is rescue 2-3- 1
on final approach.</i>

907
01:21:48,396 --> 01:21:52,127
<i>Rescue 2-3- 1, flight deck is green.</i>

908
01:21:52,767 --> 01:21:55,235
There it is.
You're being waved in.

909
01:21:55,437 --> 01:21:57,064
Thirty meters and closing.

910
01:21:57,272 --> 01:21:59,672
Twenty-five meters, winds 43.

911
01:21:59,875 --> 01:22:02,105
Set a line at 0-1-0.

912
01:22:02,611 --> 01:22:04,977
Beautiful. We're coming.

913
01:22:05,180 --> 01:22:06,408
Watch this wave, cap.

914
01:22:06,615 --> 01:22:08,606
<i>2- 3- 1, looking good.
Transfer at will.</i>

915
01:22:08,817 --> 01:22:09,943
Drop ladder.

916
01:22:13,154 --> 01:22:14,815
All right, send them down.

917
01:22:15,023 --> 01:22:16,217
Put your foot out.

918
01:22:16,892 --> 01:22:17,756
Left leg out.

919
01:22:17,959 --> 01:22:19,859
Mind your helm, goddamn it.

920
01:22:22,397 --> 01:22:23,796
Watch the deck!

921
01:22:24,933 --> 01:22:26,161
Come on.

922
01:22:27,068 --> 01:22:28,797
First survivor on deck.

923
01:22:29,004 --> 01:22:32,565
- Where's our fuel?
- Refueling tanker is on the way.

924
01:22:33,642 --> 01:22:35,576
<i>Second survivor on deck.</i>

925
01:22:35,844 --> 01:22:37,038
Jesus.

926
01:23:37,472 --> 01:23:38,461
It's gone.

927
01:23:40,942 --> 01:23:44,605
No antenna, no radio.
We're back in the 19th century.

928
01:23:48,650 --> 01:23:50,515
You want to call it quits,
turn around?

929
01:23:51,820 --> 01:23:52,809
What do you think?

930
01:23:54,756 --> 01:23:56,223
I think she's a hell of a boat.

931
01:23:56,758 --> 01:23:58,055
With a hell of a crew.

932
01:23:58,393 --> 01:23:59,724
And a hell of a skipper.

933
01:24:04,532 --> 01:24:06,500
All right then, Gloucester...

934
01:24:06,701 --> 01:24:08,100
...we're coming home!

935
01:24:28,323 --> 01:24:29,585
Take the wheel!

936
01:24:30,191 --> 01:24:31,158
Skipper, don't!

937
01:24:31,359 --> 01:24:34,385
Take the goddamn wheel!
That's an order!

938
01:24:45,140 --> 01:24:46,971
Damn, I can't see anything.

939
01:24:53,548 --> 01:24:55,413
What's the gauge say?

940
01:24:56,618 --> 01:24:59,382
It's low, Jonesy.
Where are they?

941
01:24:59,587 --> 01:25:02,556
- Tanker's on the way.
- How many stops are they making?

942
01:25:05,393 --> 01:25:06,382
No!

943
01:25:08,363 --> 01:25:10,490
Come on! Not again.

944
01:25:11,066 --> 01:25:13,364
Hello? Ethel, thank God!

945
01:25:13,568 --> 01:25:17,197
I'm going crazy here.
Even the weather guy's gone bananas.

946
01:25:17,405 --> 01:25:20,374
Have you heard from...?
Hello? Ethel?

947
01:25:21,543 --> 01:25:22,635
Shit!

948
01:25:45,967 --> 01:25:48,094
There she is! Thank God.

949
01:25:48,303 --> 01:25:51,363
Let's fill her up, save these yahoos
and get out of here.

950
01:25:51,740 --> 01:25:53,833
King 1-2, we have visual.

951
01:25:54,109 --> 01:25:57,977
Air Force rescue 2-3-1,
you've got a wet hose.

952
01:26:50,431 --> 01:26:52,956
All right now, hold on!

953
01:27:09,584 --> 01:27:11,108
In the water!

954
01:27:11,886 --> 01:27:13,376
Hold on, skip!

955
01:28:02,003 --> 01:28:03,368
Shit.

956
01:28:28,596 --> 01:28:29,620
Come on, skip!

957
01:28:33,434 --> 01:28:35,800
Come on, skip, come on!

958
01:29:03,831 --> 01:29:04,729
Yeah!

959
01:29:12,740 --> 01:29:14,139
Anything yet?

960
01:29:14,342 --> 01:29:15,434
Nothing about boats.

961
01:29:15,643 --> 01:29:18,111
- I got four nines.
- He's a liar.

962
01:29:18,313 --> 01:29:19,507
Florence.

963
01:29:21,849 --> 01:29:24,147
<i>Damage estimates
are in the high millions.</i>

964
01:29:24,352 --> 01:29:26,047
<i>Folks, the worst is yet to come.</i>

965
01:29:26,254 --> 01:29:28,051
<i>The storm of the century.</i>

966
01:29:28,256 --> 01:29:31,350
<i>Residents, stay inside,
pack sandbags against door frames.</i>

967
01:29:31,559 --> 01:29:35,188
<i>A report here that Cape Ann
fishing industry is in tatters.</i>

968
01:29:35,396 --> 01:29:38,524
<i>Lobstermen from Gloucester to Scituate
have lost their traps.</i>

969
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:43,100
<i>A missing swordboat, Andrea Gail,
out of Gloucester with a crew of six.</i>

970
01:29:43,304 --> 01:29:46,569
<i>An Air National Guard rescue
helicopter has been dispatched.</i>

971
01:29:46,774 --> 01:29:50,210
<i>At Logan International Airport,
flooded runways.</i>

972
01:29:58,753 --> 01:30:00,015
We did it!

973
01:30:09,063 --> 01:30:11,554
- Get those windows boarded up!
- All right, skip.

974
01:30:11,766 --> 01:30:13,529
Come on, board it up!

975
01:30:18,539 --> 01:30:21,599
Tell those guys forget it.
We'll get our gas somewhere else.

976
01:30:34,555 --> 01:30:35,613
What do you think?

977
01:30:43,197 --> 01:30:44,789
We're running on fumes.

978
01:30:47,301 --> 01:30:49,064
King 1-2, this isn't gonna work.

979
01:30:50,338 --> 01:30:52,101
<i>This is not our night.</i>

980
01:30:54,409 --> 01:30:58,539
We're issuing a mayday.
Give the Coast Guard our coordinates.

981
01:31:00,248 --> 01:31:01,681
We're ditching.

982
01:31:05,319 --> 01:31:09,346
<i>Mayday, mayday, Air Force rescue 2-3-1
calling Coast Guard Tamaroa.</i>

983
01:31:09,557 --> 01:31:13,516
<i>Mayday, mayday, Air Force rescue 2-3-1
calling Coast Guard Tamaroa.</i>

984
01:31:14,362 --> 01:31:16,956
King 1-2, departing the area.

985
01:31:21,135 --> 01:31:22,227
Come on!

986
01:31:22,537 --> 01:31:24,027
Let's get it up!

987
01:31:29,877 --> 01:31:31,777
All right, guys, get ready!

988
01:31:33,347 --> 01:31:34,609
Hold on!

989
01:31:34,916 --> 01:31:36,440
Get it up there!

990
01:31:39,854 --> 01:31:41,048
Get another one.

991
01:31:41,255 --> 01:31:42,347
Come on.

992
01:31:50,898 --> 01:31:53,890
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Grab them, grab them!

993
01:31:56,304 --> 01:31:58,238
Hang on, there's a swell!

994
01:32:08,216 --> 01:32:10,446
Come on, guys, try to get you close.

995
01:32:10,651 --> 01:32:12,744
- Stay together.
- Roger that.

996
01:32:18,326 --> 01:32:19,384
Number 1 is out!

997
01:32:21,095 --> 01:32:22,426
Bail! Bail out!

998
01:32:22,830 --> 01:32:25,890
- Leave yourself enough time, okay?
- I'll be fine.

999
01:32:37,078 --> 01:32:38,340
Go, Jonesy, go!

1000
01:32:42,583 --> 01:32:44,175
You're next.

1001
01:32:47,688 --> 01:32:49,155
Hold on, hold on!

1002
01:33:00,868 --> 01:33:02,563
Now, Jeremy, now!
Go! Bail out!

1003
01:33:02,904 --> 01:33:04,428
See you, Darryl.

1004
01:33:16,918 --> 01:33:19,318
No, no, no, no. No!

1005
01:34:32,893 --> 01:34:34,383
Over here!

1006
01:34:34,595 --> 01:34:37,564
We're over here!

1007
01:34:50,778 --> 01:34:52,245
Have you seen Mitchell?

1008
01:34:53,247 --> 01:34:54,236
No.

1009
01:34:54,448 --> 01:34:55,676
What about Jonesy?

1010
01:34:56,884 --> 01:34:58,181
Nothing. Just you.

1011
01:34:59,453 --> 01:35:01,580
Goddamn it, we don't lose anybody!

1012
01:35:07,995 --> 01:35:09,656
Come on, lay it on.

1013
01:35:10,431 --> 01:35:12,194
- Get it locked!
- Get them on!

1014
01:35:21,375 --> 01:35:23,070
They're not gonna make it!

1015
01:35:23,277 --> 01:35:25,245
Tell them to hold on.
I'll turn the boat.

1016
01:35:30,751 --> 01:35:32,082
Right now, let's go!

1017
01:35:37,558 --> 01:35:39,492
Come on, guys, you can do it!

1018
01:35:39,694 --> 01:35:41,787
It's jammed! It's jammed!

1019
01:35:45,766 --> 01:35:47,256
Lock it down!

1020
01:35:56,644 --> 01:35:57,941
I can't hold her!

1021
01:36:05,086 --> 01:36:06,383
Come on, get it up.

1022
01:36:06,821 --> 01:36:08,049
Put it on now!

1023
01:36:08,255 --> 01:36:09,688
Come on, this is it.

1024
01:36:11,025 --> 01:36:13,050
- Get it on.
- I'm trying!

1025
01:36:13,260 --> 01:36:14,090
Get it on.

1026
01:36:20,368 --> 01:36:21,835
It's loose. I got it!

1027
01:36:29,176 --> 01:36:30,143
Man overboard!

1028
01:36:30,811 --> 01:36:32,779
- What?!
- Two over the side.

1029
01:36:37,752 --> 01:36:39,652
Come on, help me!

1030
01:36:39,854 --> 01:36:40,980
Hold on, I got you!

1031
01:36:44,058 --> 01:36:45,491
Grab the line!

1032
01:36:58,005 --> 01:36:59,336
Oh, God.

1033
01:36:59,974 --> 01:37:01,839
We lost Bugsy!

1034
01:37:11,652 --> 01:37:12,641
Bugsy!

1035
01:37:34,141 --> 01:37:35,870
Hold on. Grab this.

1036
01:37:45,085 --> 01:37:46,484
Hold on!

1037
01:37:49,890 --> 01:37:52,358
Come on, Bugsy. Grab it!

1038
01:37:59,166 --> 01:38:00,155
Grab it!

1039
01:38:02,069 --> 01:38:03,058
Bugsy!

1040
01:38:36,570 --> 01:38:38,162
There! Right there!

1041
01:38:38,372 --> 01:38:40,363
Come on, let's go!

1042
01:38:55,689 --> 01:38:58,590
I'm here, Jeremy, I'm here.
I got you. We're here.

1043
01:38:59,593 --> 01:39:01,925
Hey, talk to me, J. Talk to me.

1044
01:39:02,129 --> 01:39:04,689
I'm all busted up, cap.

1045
01:39:05,032 --> 01:39:06,624
Can't breathe.

1046
01:39:06,834 --> 01:39:10,497
- Hey, Mitch, have you seen Jonesy?
- No.

1047
01:39:10,704 --> 01:39:13,696
Go find him. Go find Jonesy.
Go get him.

1048
01:39:54,181 --> 01:39:55,808
Boys, that's it.

1049
01:39:57,351 --> 01:39:58,648
We can't make it.

1050
01:40:05,025 --> 01:40:06,549
We're turning around.

1051
01:40:11,365 --> 01:40:13,230
Come on, cap, we can do it.

1052
01:40:13,901 --> 01:40:15,391
What about our catch?

1053
01:40:16,136 --> 01:40:17,660
We'll mug them next time.

1054
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:21,701
This piece of water belongs to us.

1055
01:40:23,077 --> 01:40:25,807
<i>The fish will gather again
for the Andrea Gail...</i>

1056
01:40:29,717 --> 01:40:30,706
...when we come back.

1057
01:40:32,820 --> 01:40:35,186
This is gonna be
the turnaround of all time.

1058
01:40:36,657 --> 01:40:37,988
Textbook.

1059
01:40:39,093 --> 01:40:40,754
So get ready.

1060
01:41:13,460 --> 01:41:16,088
If it were good news,
he would've called us.

1061
01:41:17,598 --> 01:41:21,364
The news is the rescue helicopter
had to ditch.

1062
01:41:21,568 --> 01:41:23,934
<i>We can't raise the Andrea Gail.</i>

1063
01:41:26,173 --> 01:41:27,299
What does that mean?

1064
01:41:28,008 --> 01:41:29,703
We don't know anything.

1065
01:41:30,244 --> 01:41:34,044
If anyone can survive this storm,
it's Billy Tyne. I'll give him that.

1066
01:41:34,248 --> 01:41:35,715
What do you want?

1067
01:41:36,250 --> 01:41:39,185
Credit for having the guts
to walk in here?

1068
01:41:39,386 --> 01:41:40,284
I do.

1069
01:41:41,055 --> 01:41:42,647
Give it to him.

1070
01:41:43,557 --> 01:41:44,546
How you doing, Quentin?

1071
01:41:45,359 --> 01:41:47,020
Pretty good, governor.

1072
01:41:47,795 --> 01:41:49,854
You're counting your money.

1073
01:41:50,064 --> 01:41:54,728
And my guy is out there risking
his life for a bunch of stupid fish.

1074
01:41:55,269 --> 01:41:56,293
That's the game.

1075
01:41:57,504 --> 01:42:01,497
I hate the game.
I hate the goddamn game!

1076
01:42:01,709 --> 01:42:02,733
Do you hear me?!

1077
01:42:02,943 --> 01:42:05,912
Do you read me, governor?
Do you?!

1078
01:42:06,113 --> 01:42:07,808
Do you read me?!

1079
01:42:15,923 --> 01:42:17,618
Did you see him?

1080
01:42:17,825 --> 01:42:19,520
I don't see anything!

1081
01:42:23,964 --> 01:42:26,592
Look! There's the cutter.

1082
01:42:34,908 --> 01:42:37,934
- Have them put out the cargo net.
- Cargo net, aye, sir.

1083
01:42:39,313 --> 01:42:40,940
Put me alongside them.

1084
01:42:41,682 --> 01:42:45,243
I want five men on that net.
And get the light out there.

1085
01:42:45,452 --> 01:42:47,113
Okay, guys, hook in!

1086
01:42:49,757 --> 01:42:51,122
Pick it up! Move!

1087
01:42:51,325 --> 01:42:53,190
Keep your light on those swimmers!

1088
01:42:53,393 --> 01:42:54,553
Get ready!

1089
01:42:55,796 --> 01:42:58,026
Release the net now!

1090
01:42:59,032 --> 01:43:01,466
Okay, now, Jeremy, swim!

1091
01:43:02,035 --> 01:43:03,798
Swim!

1092
01:43:15,215 --> 01:43:16,705
Give him a hand!

1093
01:43:16,917 --> 01:43:19,181
Get ready!

1094
01:43:19,386 --> 01:43:20,853
Come on!

1095
01:43:53,020 --> 01:43:55,955
All right! Let's do it again.

1096
01:43:56,156 --> 01:43:58,522
If they can't get to us,
we'll get to them.

1097
01:43:58,725 --> 01:44:00,886
Go up swell and drift down.

1098
01:44:01,094 --> 01:44:02,618
Broadside, captain?

1099
01:44:02,830 --> 01:44:05,196
Isn't it too dangerous?
It's too hairy.

1100
01:44:05,399 --> 01:44:07,026
I won't let two men drown!

1101
01:44:10,270 --> 01:44:12,898
Hold on, Jer. Just hold on.

1102
01:44:24,918 --> 01:44:27,318
When I say now, you go full throttle.
Got it?

1103
01:44:31,391 --> 01:44:33,382
We only get one chance at this.

1104
01:44:34,895 --> 01:44:35,884
And then?

1105
01:44:37,798 --> 01:44:38,924
We pray.

1106
01:44:56,617 --> 01:44:57,777
Wait.

1107
01:44:59,319 --> 01:45:00,308
Wait.

1108
01:45:10,264 --> 01:45:11,492
Wait.

1109
01:45:13,200 --> 01:45:14,189
Wait.

1110
01:45:25,679 --> 01:45:26,976
Now!

1111
01:45:36,590 --> 01:45:38,080
Faster!

1112
01:46:54,501 --> 01:46:55,934
We did it!

1113
01:46:57,537 --> 01:46:58,697
Guys, we're alive!

1114
01:46:59,239 --> 01:47:01,707
We made the turn! We did it!

1115
01:47:06,113 --> 01:47:08,741
Hey, skip, I'm giving you notice.

1116
01:47:08,949 --> 01:47:10,143
This is my last trip.

1117
01:47:10,350 --> 01:47:13,911
When we get back, I'm going right to
Salisbury Beach with Chris.

1118
01:47:14,121 --> 01:47:16,919
We're riding those go-carts,
full-time.

1119
01:47:20,327 --> 01:47:21,954
What do you think, skip?

1120
01:47:22,396 --> 01:47:24,330
We're doing 12 knots.

1121
01:47:24,731 --> 01:47:28,098
We keep this up,
make it through till dawn...

1122
01:47:28,902 --> 01:47:30,563
...we might get out of here.

1123
01:47:38,478 --> 01:47:40,036
They're coming around, Jeremy.

1124
01:47:40,247 --> 01:47:43,045
I can't make it, cap.
They're coming for you.

1125
01:47:43,250 --> 01:47:44,911
You're wrong, Jer!

1126
01:47:45,118 --> 01:47:46,449
They're coming for us.

1127
01:47:47,220 --> 01:47:49,620
I'm not gonna leave you here, Jer.

1128
01:47:50,690 --> 01:47:54,148
You have just one chance to
grab ahold of those nets.

1129
01:47:54,361 --> 01:47:56,295
- You roger that?
- Okay.

1130
01:48:04,304 --> 01:48:06,431
- Back full!
- Back full on!

1131
01:48:17,150 --> 01:48:19,641
You gotta swim now, Jer!

1132
01:48:30,397 --> 01:48:32,558
Grab it, Jer, just grab it!

1133
01:48:48,949 --> 01:48:50,143
Come on!

1134
01:49:00,327 --> 01:49:01,760
Climb! Climb!

1135
01:49:02,762 --> 01:49:03,751
Reach!

1136
01:49:10,470 --> 01:49:12,335
We lost one! Pick up the net!

1137
01:49:14,574 --> 01:49:17,737
Come on! Give me your hand!

1138
01:49:28,121 --> 01:49:32,785
Reach and grab it with everything
you got. Everything you've got!

1139
01:49:39,065 --> 01:49:40,396
Hold on!

1140
01:49:42,369 --> 01:49:43,927
Pull!

1141
01:49:48,108 --> 01:49:51,168
Yes! Get them inside
and clear this deck.

1142
01:49:56,149 --> 01:49:57,810
All right, let's go.

1143
01:49:59,619 --> 01:50:02,850
There's another man out there!
There's another man!

1144
01:50:03,056 --> 01:50:04,045
Jonesy!

1145
01:50:05,192 --> 01:50:07,558
Jonesy!

1146
01:51:10,290 --> 01:51:12,019
Skip, we're gonna make it.

1147
01:51:52,899 --> 01:51:54,924
She's not gonna let us out.

1148
01:52:21,561 --> 01:52:22,687
No.

1149
01:52:31,638 --> 01:52:34,038
Come on, you bitch!

1150
01:52:41,181 --> 01:52:43,206
Come on!

1151
01:52:53,660 --> 01:52:55,093
Come on!

1152
01:53:39,139 --> 01:53:41,300
Come on. We gotta get out.

1153
01:53:44,844 --> 01:53:46,436
How do we do this, skip?

1154
01:53:46,713 --> 01:53:48,374
No school for it.

1155
01:53:48,615 --> 01:53:49,775
Never was.

1156
01:54:13,273 --> 01:54:15,537
This is gonna be hard
on my little boy.

1157
01:54:32,625 --> 01:54:33,614
Bobby...

1158
01:54:35,028 --> 01:54:36,893
...l'm sorry I got you into this.

1159
01:54:38,998 --> 01:54:41,159
Skip, we made the right call.

1160
01:54:41,801 --> 01:54:43,268
We had to try.

1161
01:54:44,904 --> 01:54:46,428
We were so close.

1162
01:54:52,679 --> 01:54:55,239
It was a hell of a fight, though, huh?

1163
01:55:05,124 --> 01:55:07,024
Let's get out of here, huh?

1164
01:56:18,631 --> 01:56:20,121
<i>Christina.</i>

1165
01:56:21,200 --> 01:56:23,191
<i>Christina, can you hear me?</i>

1166
01:56:24,771 --> 01:56:27,831
<i>I don't know if you can,
but I'm talking to you, baby.</i>

1167
01:56:29,576 --> 01:56:31,737
<i>Do you know how much I love you?</i>

1168
01:56:32,378 --> 01:56:34,710
<i>I loved you the moment I saw you.</i>

1169
01:56:35,315 --> 01:56:36,646
<i>I love you now...</i>

1170
01:56:37,684 --> 01:56:39,481
<i>... and I'll love you forever.</i>

1171
01:56:40,920 --> 01:56:42,319
<i>No goodbye.</i>

1172
01:56:43,523 --> 01:56:45,684
<i>There's only love, Christina.</i>

1173
01:56:46,693 --> 01:56:48,092
<i>Only love.</i>

1174
01:57:19,892 --> 01:57:22,759
<i>It's been a week of round-the-clock
flights involving...</i>

1175
01:57:22,962 --> 01:57:26,090
<i>... efforts of half a dozen Northeast
air rescue stations.</i>

1176
01:57:26,299 --> 01:57:30,292
<i>However, as of this hour, the Coast
Guard has suspended its search...</i>

1177
01:57:30,503 --> 01:57:34,098
<i>... for Air National Guard
para-rescue jumper Millard Jones.</i>

1178
01:57:34,307 --> 01:57:36,502
<i>He leaves a wife and three daughters.</i>

1179
01:57:36,709 --> 01:57:39,371
<i>The search for the Andrea Gail
out of Gloucester...</i>

1180
01:57:39,579 --> 01:57:42,776
<i>... has also been suspended
after aircrafts covered...</i>

1181
01:57:42,982 --> 01:57:45,849
<i>... 116,000 square miles of ocean...</i>

1182
01:57:46,052 --> 01:57:48,543
<i>... without finding a single survivor.</i>

1183
01:57:48,755 --> 01:57:51,485
<i>We'll have more news
after these messages.</i>

1184
01:58:46,579 --> 01:58:48,410
I knew Billy Tyne.

1185
01:58:49,515 --> 01:58:52,211
I did not know his crew very well.

1186
01:58:53,086 --> 01:58:57,147
But any man who sailed with him
must've been the better for it.

1187
01:58:58,858 --> 01:59:00,450
Robert Shatford...

1188
01:59:01,227 --> 01:59:02,785
...Dale Murphy...

1189
01:59:03,529 --> 01:59:05,121
...Michael Moran...

1190
01:59:05,898 --> 01:59:07,593
...David Sullivan...

1191
01:59:08,334 --> 01:59:09,961
...Alfred Pierre...

1192
01:59:11,471 --> 01:59:14,031
...may you rest easy, long-liners...

1193
01:59:14,741 --> 01:59:17,972
...in fair winds and calm seas.

1194
01:59:22,115 --> 01:59:24,015
For those of us left behind...

1195
01:59:24,217 --> 01:59:27,311
...the unmarked grave which is
home for those lost at sea...

1196
01:59:27,520 --> 01:59:29,283
...is of no consolation.

1197
01:59:30,556 --> 01:59:32,319
It can't be visited.

1198
01:59:32,792 --> 01:59:36,387
There is no headstone on which
to rest a bunch of flowers.

1199
01:59:36,796 --> 01:59:39,356
The only place we can revisit them...

1200
01:59:39,599 --> 01:59:42,659
...is in our hearts or in our dreams.

1201
01:59:45,671 --> 01:59:49,038
They say swordboatmen suffer from
a lack of dreams.

1202
01:59:50,176 --> 01:59:52,007
That's what begets their courage.

1203
01:59:54,113 --> 01:59:56,274
Well, we'll dream for you...

1204
01:59:57,083 --> 01:59:57,981
...Billy...

1205
01:59:58,751 --> 02:00:00,218
...Bobby...

1206
02:00:00,520 --> 02:00:01,919
...and Murph...

1207
02:00:02,121 --> 02:00:03,383
...Bugsy...

1208
02:00:03,589 --> 02:00:04,783
...Sully...

1209
02:00:04,991 --> 02:00:06,891
...and Alfred Pierre.

1210
02:00:09,462 --> 02:00:11,089
Sleep well.

1211
02:00:11,664 --> 02:00:12,926
Good night.

1212
02:00:39,158 --> 02:00:40,785
I'll be asleep...

1213
02:00:40,993 --> 02:00:43,518
...and then all of a sudden,
there he is.

1214
02:00:45,097 --> 02:00:46,758
That big smile.

1215
02:00:46,966 --> 02:00:48,729
You know that smile.

1216
02:00:50,203 --> 02:00:53,138
And I say,
"Hey, Bobby, where you been?"

1217
02:00:53,873 --> 02:00:55,670
But he won't tell me.

1218
02:00:56,275 --> 02:00:58,835
He just smiles and says:

1219
02:00:59,278 --> 02:01:02,304
"Remember I'll always love you,
Christina.

1220
02:01:02,748 --> 02:01:05,546
I love you now,
and I'll love you forever.

1221
02:01:06,085 --> 02:01:07,746
There's no goodbye.

1222
02:01:08,487 --> 02:01:09,977
Only love."

1223
02:01:11,490 --> 02:01:13,082
And then he's gone.

1224
02:01:16,028 --> 02:01:18,462
But he's always happy when he goes.

1225
02:01:18,798 --> 02:01:22,199
So I know he's gotta be okay.

1226
02:01:23,436 --> 02:01:25,597
Absolutely okay.

1227
02:01:33,379 --> 02:01:35,244
I love your dream.

1228
02:01:44,624 --> 02:01:46,387
<i>The fog's just lifting.</i>

1229
02:01:46,993 --> 02:01:49,985
<i>You throw off your bow line,
throw off your stern.</i>

1230
02:01:50,296 --> 02:01:52,161
<i>You head out the South Channel...</i>

1231
02:01:52,365 --> 02:01:55,334
<i>... past Rocky Neck,
Ten Pound Island...</i>

1232
02:01:55,534 --> 02:01:58,401
<i>... past Niles Pond,
where I skated as a kid.</i>

1233
02:01:59,138 --> 02:02:00,696
<i>You blow your horn and wave to...</i>

1234
02:02:00,907 --> 02:02:03,467
<i>... the lighthouse keeper's kid
on Thatcher Island.</i>

1235
02:02:04,677 --> 02:02:06,474
<i>Then the birds show up.</i>

1236
02:02:06,846 --> 02:02:09,280
<i>Black-backs and herring gulls...</i>

1237
02:02:09,715 --> 02:02:11,046
<i>... big dump ducks.</i>

1238
02:02:11,684 --> 02:02:13,151
<i>The sun hits you.</i>

1239
02:02:13,352 --> 02:02:15,183
<i>You head north, open up to 12.</i>

1240
02:02:15,388 --> 02:02:16,912
<i>You're steaming now.</i>

1241
02:02:17,757 --> 02:02:20,225
<i>The guys are busy,
you're in charge.</i>

1242
02:02:21,027 --> 02:02:23,689
<i>You know what?
You're a goddamn swordboat captain.</i>

1243
02:02:24,931 --> 02:02:26,956
<i>Is there anything better in the world?</i>
