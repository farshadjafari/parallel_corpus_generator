1
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:59,151
Prepare profit and loss
statements after taking..

2
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,119
..into account the
following adjustments..

3
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:03,580
One..

4
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:07,649
Returns outwards Rs.1000
were wrongly included in sales.

5
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:19,961
Returns outwards Rs.1000
were wrongly included in sales..

6
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,030
In sales.

7
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,142
Included in sales..

8
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,401
"Listen to what I have to say.. "

9
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:06,076
"You know what time is. "

10
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:14,716
"The night is sleeping and
a new day has awakened. "

11
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:23,194
"This ambience is still in slumber. "

12
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:32,501
"Wishes are leading my way. "

13
00:03:54,667 --> 00:04:01,163
Returns outwards Rs.7000
were wrongly included in sales..

14
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,703
"Wake up, Sid! The time says!"

15
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:12,581
"Wake up, Sid! Let's go somewhere!"

16
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:16,349
"Wake up, Sid! Listen if you can.. "

17
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:23,294
"..the voice from all the directions. "

18
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:28,164
"Wake up! Listen. "
- Bhaiyya.. Bhaiyya!

19
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:31,192
Bhaiyya! Open the door.

20
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:33,663
Brother!

21
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,104
What are you doing in there?
Bhaiyya!

22
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:38,234
Open the door!!

23
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:42,743
Open the door!!

24
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:46,514
Chhotu! Why didn't you
wake me up sooner?!

25
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,117
You said you were going to
study all night..

26
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:49,449
..I thought you'd be up by now.

27
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:51,187
Did you fall asleep?

28
00:04:56,462 --> 00:05:00,762
You fell asleep! You had 4 cups of coffee
and you still fell asleep!

29
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:03,293
What will you do now?

30
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:04,627
How will you give your exam now?!

31
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:05,762
Just try not to fail, I guess..

32
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:08,272
Shut up! This is all your fault!

33
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,836
Now you sit here and
eat this breakfast! I'm off..

34
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:14,744
Move.
- Best of luck!

35
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,455
The same bloody situation again, Sid..

36
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:30,226
..you should've at least studied
for this one last exam..

37
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,658
Ten questions out of thirty?

38
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,227
That's not so bad..
you'll probably pass..

39
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:44,542
Or, maybe you won't..
What are you going to do, Sid?

40
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,510
You're never going to do anything,
Sidharth Mehra.

41
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:50,272
You'll definitelyfail in this exam.

42
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,808
Because that's what happens..

43
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:53,283
..when you don't attend
a single lecture the whole year.

44
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,620
This is just what you deserve!

45
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,651
But what do you have to worry about, Sid?

46
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:02,685
Who cares if you fail?
Your father will still be loaded..

47
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:07,298
..and you'll still have the best car
in this college! Right!

48
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,332
Shut up!
- Relax.

49
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,734
Don't listen to these losers,
Sid.. don't worry.

50
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,797
I'm your friend..

51
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,273
..and I know that you're going to pass,
like you always do!

52
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,270
By the way,
where were you last night?

53
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:22,273
I kept calling..
why didn't you answer?

54
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:24,282
Did you read the notes I gave you?

55
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,319
Oh shut up Laxmi..
Can't you at least let him dream in peace?

56
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:31,279
Sid! I'm in the same situation as you.

57
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:32,688
I couldn't study last night either.

58
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,355
I was with Neha, dude..

59
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:44,336
She was studying economics and
I was studying her. All night long!

60
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:46,968
Anyway don't worry brother..

61
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,366
Ifwe fail, we'll fail together.

62
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,303
We've been together since kindergarten.

63
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,634
What's one more year, right?

64
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:52,836
Don't worry, pal.

65
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,354
Everyone, pens down! Stop writing.

66
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:10,818
Make sure your exam roll numbers
are entered correctly.

67
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:13,627
Come on, stop writi ng.

68
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:16,832
Guys farewell party!
Tomorrow night! Do come, Ok?

69
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,334
You can do this dance there!

70
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:19,662
Farewell party tomorrow night!

71
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:22,333
There's going to be food,
dance everything! Do come!

72
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:23,739
Farewell party!
Tomorrow night! Do come, Ok?

73
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,377
Students hostel..
Tomorrow night.. Farewell party..

74
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,506
Please arrive..

75
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,648
Hey Nisha. Stop there!

76
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,620
What the hell is Debbie's problem?

77
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,455
I don't want to go to her farewell party.

78
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:41,785
It'll be bloody boring anyway..

79
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:44,352
Shut up Sid! We have to go!

80
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:48,666
We might never see these people again.
This is it.

81
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:49,894
College is over.

82
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,369
Where did the last 5 years go?

83
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:56,773
Life is going to change now..
there's so much to do!

84
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,806
You're right, there's a lot to do!

85
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:03,009
Now that the exams are over,
I can finally start my diet!

86
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:12,417
From tomorrow.. I swear!

87
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:15,459
You don't have to diet.
I'll marry you!

88
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:17,319
Please, don't be silly..

89
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:18,454
Ok, can we go now?
- Yeah let's go.

90
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:19,589
Come Rishi.

91
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,396
What is this?

92
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:28,604
Sid! Give it back! Sid!

93
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,404
What the hell is this?!

94
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:39,043
He bought it for Neha.
I think her name's engraved in there too..

95
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:40,810
Give it back Sid.

96
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,413
Rish, you gotta be kidding me..

97
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:44,547
Sid, I love her!

98
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,416
Dude, you're pathetic!

99
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:47,584
Don't be an idiot.

100
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,694
Rish.. are you actually
going to propose to Neha?!

101
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,931
Put that ring away!
Have you gone mad?

102
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,426
Why are you being so serious?

103
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:59,837
You know, everyone has
to get serious after college..

104
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,698
..you'll have to do it too.

105
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,367
Right, which is why I've made
a really serious plan.

106
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:06,934
What? - Tell me.
- Lets go and get drunk!

107
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,448
Sid! Be serious!
- Be serious.

108
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:11,483
Yeah but I don't want to
be serious right now!

109
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:15,452
We've finished our exams today..
who cares about tomorrow..

110
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:20,758
..as long as we can have
some fun.. tonight? Come on!

111
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,454
Let's go!

112
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,390
Let's go!
- Yes.

113
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:31,868
"What to do, my heart is singing?"

114
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:37,069
"What to do, my Iife is intoxicating?"

115
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:41,671
"What to do, slowly
I am getting intoxicated?"

116
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:46,644
"What to do, I am getting
a Iittle effected by it?"

117
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:11,067
"What to do, my slept
desires have awakened. "

118
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:16,438
"What to do, my Iife is Iost in the way?"

119
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:20,918
"What to do, I have new
dreams in my eyes?"

120
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:26,523
"What to do, I am getting
a Iittle effected by it?"

121
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,562
"What to do?"

122
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:09,229
"These days and nights. "

123
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:14,066
"All these talks. "

124
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:18,835
"Fragrant. "

125
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,775
"Intoxicated. "

126
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:30,681
"Let this time stand still
and I stay the same way I am. "

127
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:38,154
"What to do, my heart is singing?"

128
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:43,127
"What to do, my life is intoxicating?"

129
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:48,200
"What to do, slowly
I am getting intoxicated?"

130
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:53,712
"What to do, I am getting
a little effected by it?"

131
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:58,609
"What to do?"

132
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,234
"What to do?"

133
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:18,890
Is that Rishi, no?

134
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,691
Maa! Why don't you knock..?

135
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:25,360
You are being my son..
Why knocking?

136
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:26,896
What do you want, ma?

137
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:32,811
I came to meet you..
So much time not seeing you..

138
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:35,711
Ma please stop speaking in English..

139
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:36,839
You don't know how to..

140
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:42,811
How your exam Siddy?

141
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,714
It was Ok..

142
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:48,385
I'm so proud of you..
You're a graduate now.

143
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:56,333
Now you must learn
some organization Siddy..

144
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:02,172
What mess.. Why do you keep
ordering pizza all the time?

145
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,743
I make such good food at home.

146
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:10,311
And stop playing videogames all day.

147
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,082
You have way too many clothes!

148
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,045
Throw them all away now.

149
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,284
These tiny-tiny tshirts
don't suit you anymore.

150
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:24,357
You are the man now.. Not boy..

151
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:26,122
You are mature.

152
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:30,330
You should wear shirts..
you'll look handsome..

153
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:33,200
Maa, I always look handsome!
Stop bugging me!

154
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,875
And don't touch my things!
I've told you this before!

155
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:51,890
Ma.. Here, you can fold it.

156
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:54,790
And don't feel bad now..

157
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,788
Will you eat dinner with us?
I made it myself..

158
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,191
Eating? - Yes Ma.

159
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:06,100
What a car man!

160
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:19,474
Sid, you should join the office.

161
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,188
Whoa! Where did the office come from?

162
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,281
Your college is over, right?

163
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,860
And you don't have
classes to skip anymore..?

164
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:31,354
No..

165
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,829
Then you're joining the office.

166
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,829
But pa.. what am I going to do there?

167
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,870
Work, what else?

168
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,033
But pa! Office?!

169
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:49,845
I mean.. our company
manufactures bathroom furnishings!

170
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,410
'Flower Showers' for heaven's sake..

171
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:55,145
It's just.. it's just not my thing!

172
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:57,314
Just not your thing?

173
00:15:57,923 --> 00:15:59,914
Do you know that 'Bathroom Fittings
and Furnishings Association'

174
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:02,119
Rated those same 'shower heads'
number 1 last year?!

175
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:06,020
Everyone from millionaires to mailmen are
buying our showers!

176
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:07,390
Do you know what that means?

177
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:11,528
Our company has taught lndia
how to shower in style!

178
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,405
No! - No!

179
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,444
No way! I'm not joining the office!

180
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:21,470
Ok then Sid!

181
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:22,946
Actually, I was thinking that..

182
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:24,880
..this car would look
really good in our garage.

183
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:30,485
You're not serious? Are you?!

184
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:33,891
Just work at the office for 6 months.

185
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:35,017
The car is yours..

186
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:38,894
6 months?!
That's too long, pa.. 1 5 days..

187
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:42,196
Do I look like an idiot?
At least 90 days..

188
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:45,401
No pa.. twenty days..

189
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:46,938
Minimum 60 days..

190
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,439
No more than 30 days.

191
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:53,903
Thirty days? Ok done!
You can start work tomorrow.

192
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:57,915
Wake up.
- Tomorrow?! Yeah ok..

193
00:16:58,417 --> 00:16:59,475
"Wake up."

194
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:06,218
Pa.. What kind of a deal is this?
A Porsche for a month's work?

195
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:11,392
My son is joining my office.
That's the biggest deal!

196
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,299
"Wake up, Sid. Wake up. "

197
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,198
Sid..

198
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:24,606
Sorry ma, I have to go.
My friends are here.

199
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:26,877
Eat something before you go..

200
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:28,207
Mother I will be going to office
from tomorrow.

201
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,338
Last night of freedom..

202
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:30,473
Bye! Love you.

203
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:37,487
Friends Hello!
DJ cut the music!

204
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,159
Laila.. got any plans after college?

205
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:44,428
I'm going for the Miss lndia contest!

206
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,154
I've been training for a year now..

207
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:50,632
Dieting, workouts..
Hey, you wanna feel my abs?

208
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:52,904
Have you seen Taare Zameen Par?

209
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:56,372
You know, my life is
exactly like that film..

210
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:59,443
I don't want to be
a journalist anymore.

211
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,909
I can't handle
this tabloid culture..

212
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:05,641
Rishi! This party is so tacky!
I wanna go home!

213
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:11,581
Baby! Not everything can be
as perfect as you, can it? Lemon tart?

214
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:15,187
I wanna go home, Rishi.
I'm leaving. Bye.

215
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,921
But what about the lemon tart..?

216
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:19,589
Do you love lemon tart more than me?
I'm going home!

217
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,132
I am going home.
- Listen, please. I love you.

218
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,397
Hi everyone.
This song goes up to Aarti.

219
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,934
Aarti, I love you.

220
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:53,957
Stop! Please don't!

221
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:57,091
I hate being photographed..

222
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,028
Why?

223
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:03,032
Because.. Because
I don't look good in them.

224
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,706
Not at all, I think you'll look nice.

225
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:10,239
Some other time, Ok?

226
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:17,517
You're not from my college, are you?

227
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,648
Nope..

228
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:21,989
Thought as much.. you look
a little older than this crowd.

229
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:24,992
Thanks! Only a little I hope.

230
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:29,598
So what are you doing at this party?

231
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,733
I came along with some
girls from the hostel..

232
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:37,664
This girl Debbie,
she's one of the organizers and..

233
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:40,211
Wait a minute..
You came here with Debbie!?

234
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:42,204
Yeah..

235
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:43,748
Oh God, if she sees you with me, she's..

236
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,353
What's WRONG with you?

237
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,618
With me?
She's the one with the problem.

238
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:57,755
That freak! Anyway, you're lucky,
my company is way better than hers.

239
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,022
Is that so?
- Yeah, seriously.

240
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,699
Ok.. Iet's find out.

241
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:04,432
So what do you do?

242
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:08,706
Me? Er.. I spend my dad's money.

243
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:12,703
Nice. And what do plan
on doing after college?

244
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:17,044
I plan on continuing to
spend my dad's money.

245
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,241
Sit.

246
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:24,319
What about you?
What do you do?

247
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,522
I'm new to Bombay.
Here to earn my own money.

248
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,722
Oh? So you're not from Bombay?

249
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:32,058
Uh-huh..

250
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:34,390
Do you like it here?

251
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,724
Actually I haven't seen much yet.

252
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:41,071
I got off the train and
went to the hostel, and now I'm here.

253
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:44,469
Wait a minute..
You got here TODAY!?

254
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:46,602
Yeah..

255
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:48,270
And out of all the places
you could have gone to,

256
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,812
You chose THlS boring party?

257
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:52,207
Why?

258
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:55,811
It was too late to go anywhere else..

259
00:20:56,822 --> 00:21:00,690
Listen, this is Bombay..
It's never late here..

260
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:07,225
And you know what?
The city is at its best at night.

261
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:09,428
Less traffic, less heat..

262
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:12,099
Really, you should have
been out there right now..

263
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,171
So let's go for a walk!

264
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:19,105
Walk?
- Yeah..

265
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:20,837
When?
- Now..

266
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,177
Ok.
- Ok?

267
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,309
Sure.. Ok, Let's go..

268
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:34,858
One second, hold on.. I don't want
to give you the wrong idea..

269
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,589
But it was your idea..

270
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:40,263
I know, but I don't
even know you and..

271
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:41,663
Well, I don't knowyou either..

272
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:44,861
Yeah but listen, it's not like
I want to sleep with you!

273
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:49,534
Whoa! Did I say that I wanted
to sleep with you?!

274
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,542
It didn't even cross my mind..

275
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:54,872
Oh come on, be honest.

276
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,672
You met a girl at a party,
and you're leaving with her in 5 minutes.

277
00:21:57,749 --> 00:21:58,875
Of course it crossed your mind!

278
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:02,677
Ok, it might have..

279
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:05,880
But if you have a problem with that,
it won't again.

280
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:07,282
It's all good.

281
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,556
Really? Ok let's go for that walk then.

282
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:19,295
Ok. Wait a second..
What's your name? I'm Sidharth..

283
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,302
I'm Aisha! Hi!

284
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:27,636
No one.

285
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:31,178
Really? You don't have
any friends here?

286
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,242
Family?

287
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:34,919
Nope. - Then you must have a job..

288
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,578
Not yet!

289
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:39,185
You ran away from home, didn't you?

290
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,391
Really Aisha..
why have you come to Bombay?

291
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,254
To meet you..

292
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:47,189
Come on, tell me seriously.

293
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,727
Seriously, to become independent.

294
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:56,666
I'm from Calcutta, Sidharth.
I've lived there all my life.

295
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:01,267
I wanted to give my life a new direction,
so I came here.

296
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,807
To try something new..

297
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:06,475
Like a holiday?

298
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:12,279
No Sidharth..!
Not like a holiday.. Iike.. Iife!

299
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:17,952
Do you know the feeling
when you cook your own food..

300
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:20,556
..make your own money, and spend.

301
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,231
Live a life you've made for yourself..?

302
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,230
Independence! Know what I mean?

303
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:29,765
No..

304
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:31,237
Forget it.

305
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:33,570
But what are you going to do here?

306
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:37,779
I'll work, what else?
Do you know this magazine?

307
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,988
Mumbai Beat. Of course!
It has great photographs!

308
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:45,317
And good articles too.

309
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:48,454
I'm going to their office tomorrow,
for an interview.

310
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:53,396
Aah.. Of course! That diary at the party..

311
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,994
You're a writer, aren't you?

312
00:23:57,002 --> 00:24:01,735
Well, not professionally.
But soon, I hope..

313
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:08,275
So Sidharth,
tell me something about Bombay.

314
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:10,538
What would you like to know?

315
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:15,278
If there was one place in Bombay you..

316
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:17,947
..could show me tonight,
what would that be?

317
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,696
The sea has always been really
special for Bombay, hasn't it?

318
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,499
I guess I can see why..

319
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:38,635
..In a city where anything
and everything can change,..

320
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:41,035
..the sea is a constant.

321
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:45,380
It'll always be here. It's beautiful.

322
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:50,851
Actually Aisha, you should see
the sea when it rains.

323
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,314
The Bombay monsoons are to die for!

324
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:58,327
People might complain
about the traffic and the flooding..

325
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:00,395
but, I just love the monsoon.

326
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,595
When it rains,
the sea looks amazing!

327
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:10,735
I can stare at it for hours..
it's really awesome.

328
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:16,340
Wow.. I'm going to remember that..

329
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:22,417
Can I ask you something, Aisha?

330
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:24,680
How can you still have more questions?

331
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:26,682
Ask..

332
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:30,353
You're all alone here, aren't you scared?

333
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:35,557
Are you kidding Sidharth? I'm terrified!

334
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,633
I've never lived alone before.

335
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:43,439
But you know what.. I'll get over it.

336
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,368
Coming to Bombay was a dream.

337
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,838
And now that it's actually coming true.

338
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:51,109
I can't let fear stand in my way.

339
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:56,451
There's so much to do that
I won't have time to be afraid!

340
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:03,123
Well.. I think you're
really tough, Aisha.. really.

341
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:07,064
I can't even imagine doing
what you're doing.

342
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,000
So, I guess, cheers to your dream!

343
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:13,662
Cheers.

344
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:21,874
.. my father made a fortune

345
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:24,140
manufacturing bathroom
furnishings here..

346
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:28,552
It's quite an impressive story,
but 'flower showers'!

347
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,746
I mean isn't that ridiculous?

348
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:35,084
Well this is me..
Single Women's Hostel!

349
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:38,553
So, when can I call you?

350
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:42,425
Actually, I don't have a phone yet.

351
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,494
Sidharth, I don't wanna
keep saying this but..

352
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,970
I really don't want to
give you the wrong idea..

353
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:52,167
God, I get it! I have
the same idea as you.

354
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:55,104
That we should be.. friends.

355
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:59,777
Friends is great..
Why don't you give me your email lD?

356
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:01,516
Pen?
- Right there..

357
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,180
Sidharth..

358
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,925
You're my first friend in Bombay.

359
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:12,188
Sid.. friends call me Sid.

360
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:15,059
Thanks for tonight, Sid..

361
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,614
What are you doing in there?

362
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:39,554
Sir got tired of waiting
for you and left already..

363
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:42,216
Stop bugging me, Chhotu!
I just need 5 more minutes, Ok?

364
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:20,993
Yes? How can I help you?

365
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,601
Mr. Ram Mehra..?

366
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,736
Sir is out. And you are..?

367
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:32,209
I'm his son.. Sid.. Sidharth..

368
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:35,144
Oh?! Sorry! I'm really very sorry!

369
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,871
How nice to see you
in the office Mr. Mehra!

370
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:40,743
Er.. call me Sid?

371
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:43,151
Ok, Mr. Mehra. Please come.

372
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:53,821
You're so whipped, dude!

373
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:58,166
She's your girlfriend,
not your boss! Be a man!

374
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:04,571
Oh hi pa! Rishi I'll have
to call you back..

375
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:06,034
Okay, bye.

376
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:09,905
Can we start work now, Sid?

377
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:11,778
Of course, that's why I'm here..

378
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:16,586
Ok then Sid! This is going to
be your last pizza in my cabin.

379
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:21,248
In fact, you won't even be
allowed in here without my permission.

380
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:22,651
This is not our house Sidharth.

381
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:25,924
This is my office. And we have
rules here. Is that clear?

382
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,928
You will work outside,
with rest of my staff.

383
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:35,132
And because you know nothing
about Mehra Furnishings.

384
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,002
You'll have to read
company's literature.

385
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:39,600
You will have to read up
on the company's background..

386
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:43,807
..our locations, our turnover,
our clients.. everything.

387
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:45,816
Okay?

388
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:51,011
By next Tuesday, you have to pick
a department to work for.

389
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:54,148
This might all seem
a little dull to you at first..

390
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:56,750
..but eventually, it'll get interesting.

391
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:03,163
Lastly, you are not
my spoilt son in here Sid..

392
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:06,629
..but a young boy
with a chance to understand..

393
00:30:06,704 --> 00:30:08,638
..the workings of a very big company.

394
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,365
Consider yourself lucky.

395
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:41,661
Hello 'my first Bombay friend'.
How are you?

396
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:45,868
I was thinking about you today..
so, here I am!

397
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:48,276
Anyhow, the news is..

398
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:51,747
I went in to the magazine office
for my first interview today..

399
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:54,811
..and Sid.. it was amazing!

400
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,014
Some places have such character..

401
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:59,682
..that you immediately
identify with them.

402
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,689
Do you know that feeling?

403
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:04,691
I had a meeting
with the Creative Director.

404
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,428
It went off quite well actually.

405
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:08,890
Amit is also Head Photographer there.

406
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,693
Didn't you say that you liked
the photographs in this magazine?

407
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:16,296
If I get this job,
you should come visit sometime.

408
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:22,778
My final interview is in a few days.
Keeping my fingers crossed!

409
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:26,777
That's it for now. Aisha.

410
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:33,715
Hello 'new girl in the city'.

411
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:35,723
Good to know that you had
an interesting day.

412
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:38,921
Because I just had the
worst day of my life!

413
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:42,865
Dad's office is a prison!

414
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:48,204
The people around me come
to work at the same time..

415
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:50,207
..Ieave at the same time.

416
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:53,204
I think they even
wear the same clothes!

417
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,409
Don't they get bored?!

418
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:59,348
You're so lucky you're not stuck with a
thousand pages of tax returns!

419
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:01,341
Later, Sid.

420
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:07,482
Dear Sid, I'm sorry that
you're not enjoying work

421
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:11,753
But I'm sure it'll get better..
Just keep at it.

422
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,488
Take me for instance.

423
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:17,498
Remember how scared I was
when I first came to Bombay?

424
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:22,764
I couldn't even take
a walk by myself! And now..

425
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:25,501
I've been all over the city, Sid!

426
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:26,835
Everywhere!

427
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:30,245
I wake up and walk out.

428
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:33,509
Without thinking about
where I'm going or what I'm doing..

429
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:35,984
just aimlessly walking.

430
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:40,780
And the funny thing is
that I don't feel scared anymore.

431
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:43,854
In fact, these days,
I feel like I'm finally..

432
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:45,928
Free!

433
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:49,193
And then.. Iast night..

434
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:02,211
Papa!

435
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:06,808
I can't live here anymore!

436
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:11,344
It's time I found
a place of my own. Till then.

437
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:12,480
Aisha.

438
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:15,150
Ma..

439
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:19,018
Ma.. do you have a good housing
broker's number?

440
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:24,827
900888000. That's the number
for Prem Dubey

441
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:26,836
The best broker in Bombay.

442
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:30,103
Also, it's time you got a phone..

443
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:33,833
..so I could invite you to
rocking parties! Ok bye!

444
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:46,246
Wake up.

445
00:33:56,401 --> 00:34:01,862
Sid. It's Tuesday.
I'll see you in my cabin in half an hour.

446
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:02,997
Get up!

447
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:22,550
Thank you so much
for Dube-ji's number Sid.

448
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,488
You're a saviour!
I'm going to look atflats today.

449
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:26,621
Wish me luck..

450
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:50,447
Make sure everything
is delivered by tomorrow.

451
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:51,920
Yes, sir.
- You can go.

452
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,047
Let's go, Sid..

453
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:57,252
He left, Sir..

454
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:14,338
Mrs. D'Monte..

455
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:15,470
Yes?

456
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:18,208
I just wanted to see your flat.
Mr. Dubey told me..

457
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:21,149
So why the hell are
you bothering me?

458
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:24,219
Didn't Dubey tell you that they
keys are with Sonia on the fourth floor?!

459
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:27,353
That idiot.
Take them from Sonia!

460
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:30,083
Where do these people come from..

461
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,020
Hi!

462
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:37,693
Hi? Sid? Sid! Oh my god!
What are you doing here?

463
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:41,632
Me? I'm.. staking you!

464
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:45,099
Shut up! You're kidding, right?

465
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:49,568
Yeah man. I called Dubey
and he told me you'd be here.

466
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:50,705
So I thought I'd come and help you.

467
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,040
Oh how sweet!

468
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:59,580
So this is where Dubey has sent you,
- Yes. - That idiot!

469
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:03,724
This building doesn't
even have a watchman, or a lift!

470
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:07,056
And this gate,
it belongs in a museum!

471
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,732
Aisha? Aisha!

472
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:23,102
Shit! Mrs. D'Monte never
told me Sonia's flat number.

473
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:33,017
God, I can't climb four
floors again! You do it..

474
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,757
401. Sonia Gill stays in flat 401.

475
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:44,028
You've come to see the flat,
haven'tyou?

476
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:45,260
Just one minute.

477
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:01,050
Oh Sanju.. it's you..

478
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:03,719
Hi.. they've come to see the flat..

479
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,784
Aww.. have they now?

480
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:13,724
Sanju.. Sanju! - Ok, bye. - Get in here!!
Stay away from that tramp!!

481
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:15,288
That old dried-up prune!!

482
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:23,170
Oh, so you're interested
in the flat, are you?

483
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:34,075
Actually, I am. Hi, I'm Aisha.

484
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:35,810
Sonia.

485
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:39,155
Anyway, I should warn you.
The flat's really dirty.

486
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:41,184
No one stayed here since a year.

487
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:43,690
Mrs. D'Monte can't climb up the stairs..

488
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,820
..so there's been zero maintenance.

489
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,530
But, here, see for yourself.

490
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:50,825
Thanks.

491
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,526
Aisha.. it's like a haunted house in here.

492
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:20,125
Let's go. This place is a 'dump'.

493
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,293
Sid.. you're going to
think that I'm crazy..

494
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,193
Why?

495
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:26,566
Because I actually like this flat..

496
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:28,670
What?! That's impossible!

497
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:29,797
I'm taking it, Sid..

498
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,136
But Aisha, it's filthy..

499
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:37,873
So we'll clean it..

500
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:41,409
You know, Chhotu's room is
bigger than this.. I swear..

501
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,144
Well, good for Chhotu!
I'm taking this flat.

502
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,680
But this is the first flat we've seen.
We could keep looking!

503
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:50,349
Of course we could..
but we won't! I've made up my mind!

504
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:53,755
You know what? You were right..

505
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:54,889
You really ARE crazy!

506
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,466
Where are you off to now?

507
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:01,296
To check out my building's terrace!

508
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:02,630
'MY' building?

509
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:03,831
Aisha wait..

510
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:05,299
What?

511
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,207
Are you really sure
you wanna live here?

512
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:11,615
If it's about money,
maybe I can help you..

513
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:13,307
I'll ask dad for some.

514
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:17,910
Sid, that's really sweet.
But no thanks!

515
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:21,817
Aisha..

516
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:30,825
You're so stubborn! Listen, I don't
think this area's very safe.

517
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,194
Why don't I do some research
and send you an email?

518
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,937
Look, you're not from here,
you don't..

519
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:43,706
Whoa..

520
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:54,816
What a city!

521
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,222
Sid, do you really
want to help me?

522
00:39:57,962 --> 00:40:02,422
Then help me turn
this 'dump' into a home.. Yeah?

523
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:06,527
Ok.
- Thanks.

524
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:33,854
"The colors offun belong to me."

525
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:40,603
"The colors offriendship belong to me."

526
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:54,382
"The colors offun belong to me. "

527
00:40:55,286 --> 00:41:01,316
"The colors offriendship belong to me. "

528
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:09,028
"The color of happiness
is hidden in these colors. "

529
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:15,828
"See to that they don 't fade.
These are the colors of life. "

530
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:21,811
"Life is crazy.
These colors are beautiful. "

531
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:29,310
"Life is crazy. There's a new desire. "

532
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:35,514
"Life is crazy. Sing along with me. "

533
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:49,330
"Some moments filled with colors. "

534
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:56,507
"Some moments filled with colors. "

535
00:41:57,047 --> 00:42:02,952
"Sometimes there 's silence all around. "

536
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:11,659
"Sometimes there's intoxication. "

537
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:17,358
Your credit card statement..

538
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:20,561
It's been taken care of.

539
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:32,373
"Painted so many colors day and night. "

540
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:39,013
"Like somebody tells us something. "

541
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:46,989
"Everyone belongs to us
and are colors of Iight. "

542
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:53,530
"Look.. these are the colors of Iife. "

543
00:42:53,604 --> 00:42:59,565
"Life is crazy.
These colors are beautiful. "

544
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:06,450
"Life is crazy. There's a new desire. "

545
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:13,414
"Life is crazy. Sing along with me. "

546
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:30,169
"Life is crazy. "

547
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:34,502
"Life is crazy. "

548
00:43:44,855 --> 00:43:47,153
"Life is crazy. "

549
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:49,852
Happy Happy Anniversary
to you Sarita!

550
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:51,121
Thank you so m uch!

551
00:43:52,863 --> 00:43:54,455
You look so gorgeous!

552
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:55,793
This is my wedding saree.

553
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:58,797
Sorry l' m late.
- Hello Sid.

554
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:04,967
Look at you! How handsome!
You should become a film star!!

555
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:08,069
Bye.

556
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:11,072
You are handsomest my son!

557
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,611
I'm also feeling that
you should become a film star.

558
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:19,019
You sit around doing nothing anyway..

559
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,487
Ma! Stop it!

560
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:24,086
Congratulations.. On the anniversary..
Madam Mehra!

561
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:28,598
Thanks. - This is my Mrs.
and my daughter Tanya.

562
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,493
Ram, Tanya just
got back from the US.

563
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:37,496
She was getting a design
degree at Parson's University.

564
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:38,966
She's brilliant!

565
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:44,504
I told herto join my company,
but she says she is still thinking..

566
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:47,182
This generation, I tell you..

567
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:50,516
Wants to be independent..
right, Sidharth?

568
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:55,720
Sidharth?! Made any plans
for your future yet?

569
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:07,002
Excuse me.. Hello. Aisha?
What's up? When did you get a phone?!

570
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:12,271
Busy man! So, Mehra, your son's
all grown up now, huh?

571
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:14,810
When is he taking
over your business?

572
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:20,540
Who knows?
He's also still thinking..

573
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:30,989
Hi. - Hey, thanks Aisha.. you keep
rescuing me from every boring party.

574
00:45:32,963 --> 00:45:36,091
By the way, you were right.
The flat's looking really nice.

575
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:45,937
So Aisha..
it's the middle of the night..

576
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:51,304
you and me.. alone in your apartment..
what's going on?

577
00:45:52,816 --> 00:45:55,250
Sid.. I feel silly saying this..

578
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:57,710
..but I just didn't want
to be alone tonight.

579
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:02,783
You see, tomorrow,
well in ten minutes actually..

580
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:07,963
It's my birthday! I've never been
alone on my birthday before..

581
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:11,059
Your birthday!?
Why didn't you tell me before?

582
00:46:11,301 --> 00:46:13,599
We would have gone out
and really partied!

583
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:14,728
Well, this is kind of a party, isn't it?

584
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:17,002
You, me and two cups of tea?

585
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:23,239
Yeah.. but something's still missing.

586
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:25,207
What?

587
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,148
We still have ten minutes
though, don't we? - Yes.

588
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:28,809
Ok then!

589
00:46:37,761 --> 00:46:39,695
Sid, this is so stupid!
What are you doing?

590
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:41,689
Don't turn around, Aisha.

591
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:46,932
You better not be
messing up my kitchen!

592
00:46:47,371 --> 00:46:51,000
No no, it's very clean.
Spotless.. just give me ten seconds.

593
00:46:58,715 --> 00:46:59,773
Aisha..

594
00:47:07,791 --> 00:47:08,849
Happy Birthday Aisha!

595
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:48,289
Thank you Sid.

596
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,758
What for?

597
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,431
You've done so much for me.

598
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:56,705
If there's ever anything
I can do in return, just ask, ok?

599
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:58,766
Anything?

600
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,941
Ok, not 'anything'!
You're a good friend, Sid.

601
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:10,444
Can I ask you something, Aisha?

602
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:12,446
Ask away..

603
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:17,955
You and l.. we've become friends now,
which is great.

604
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:20,720
But if you think about it..

605
00:48:20,797 --> 00:48:26,429
..we could've become more than friends..

606
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:30,104
So, why do you think
that never happened?

607
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:36,879
Sid! It just didn't.
We're better off as friends, anyway.

608
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:39,909
Besides, I didn't really think I could..

609
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:42,952
fall in love with someone
like you.. That's why..

610
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:46,888
Why not?
I mean, I'm kinda perfect.

611
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:53,127
No seriously Aisha..
what's wrong with me?

612
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:56,298
There's nothing wrong with you..

613
00:48:57,067 --> 00:49:00,230
Sid, I don't want to talk about this.
You'll feel bad..

614
00:49:01,004 --> 00:49:04,496
Why would I feel bad?
It's not as if I'm in love with you!

615
00:49:04,908 --> 00:49:06,307
Come on, we can talk about this..

616
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:14,049
Ok! I think.. you're still a kid.

617
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:18,880
A bit immature.. childish.

618
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:21,787
You're just not what I'm looking for.

619
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:27,796
Ok, this is going to be fun!
What are you looking for, Aisha?

620
00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:32,391
I guess someone who is..
independent, for starters..

621
00:49:33,403 --> 00:49:36,429
Someone with a career,
a goal in life.

622
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,332
Somebody I can relate to.

623
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,871
In short, a MAN.. not a boy!

624
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:48,811
Basically, the exact opposite of me!

625
00:49:48,885 --> 00:49:52,878
Basically.. You're the
wrong profile for me, Sid.

626
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,822
Actually, you're right.
I'm too young for you.

627
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:06,826
You should go out with
someone your own age.

628
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:08,301
I knew you were going to feel bad!

629
00:50:08,438 --> 00:50:10,372
By the way,
how old do you think I am?

630
00:50:11,074 --> 00:50:12,132
Thirty.

631
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:13,908
Seriously?!
- Yeah..

632
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:16,375
I'm 21.
And if you bug me any more,

633
00:50:16,446 --> 00:50:17,845
I'm throwing you off this terrace..

634
00:50:17,914 --> 00:50:22,317
Relax! I was just kidding!
Come now, make a birthday wish.

635
00:50:23,587 --> 00:50:26,112
What birthday wish..
I just hope I get this job..

636
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:32,519
You're next.

637
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:22,302
Vidhi Nayak?

638
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:23,437
Aisha Bannerjee.

639
00:51:23,513 --> 00:51:29,611
Aisha Bannerjee.. Right.
You've already had an interview here?

640
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,148
Then why wait 2 weeks
for the second one?

641
00:51:31,988 --> 00:51:33,922
Uhh, you were busy,
Sir.. That's why..

642
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:36,387
Oh yes of course..
I was busy.

643
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:42,922
But, you know.. Well, you should
know that I'm a very busy man.

644
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:45,430
My last assistant, Edna..

645
00:51:46,002 --> 00:51:48,061
She was brilliant.
Absolutely brilliant.

646
00:51:48,138 --> 00:51:50,663
And then she had to go
and get brilliantly pregnant!

647
00:51:51,208 --> 00:51:55,406
My bad luck, I suppose.
And your good luck!

648
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:01,949
So, Aisha Bannerjee, your
application letter seems interesting..

649
00:52:02,018 --> 00:52:03,383
But your resume is pretty weak.

650
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:06,479
Two months at the
Calcutta State Library? That's it?

651
00:52:06,556 --> 00:52:09,286
Yeah but I was also the editor
for my college newspaper for 2 years!

652
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:11,951
I'm talking about actual experience.

653
00:52:12,028 --> 00:52:13,427
Serious work.. Iike we do here.

654
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:17,331
I am a workaholic. I'm extremely
hard to work for, Ms. Bannerjee.

655
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,958
Think you could keep up?

656
00:52:19,035 --> 00:52:20,366
Absolutely..
I won't disappoint you, Sir.

657
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:22,701
I've come here all the way
from Calcutta only to become a writer..

658
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:24,338
I will learn much from you.

659
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:30,971
Writer? Why did you apply for this job
if you wanted to become a writer?

660
00:52:31,047 --> 00:52:32,571
An assistant's work is very clerical.

661
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:36,312
Cleaning up my desk
doesn't require any creativity.

662
00:52:36,386 --> 00:52:38,650
Besides, this is a magazine
about Bombay..

663
00:52:38,722 --> 00:52:40,121
..and you're not even from here..

664
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:42,988
But, you weren't from Bombay
either when you joined this magazine.

665
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:44,720
And now you're
the Chief Editor here.

666
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:48,154
I know everything about you.

667
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:52,297
I applied for this job
after a lot of deliberation.

668
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,470
In fact, I've pictured myself giving you..

669
00:52:54,538 --> 00:52:55,732
.. this interview
a thousand times already.

670
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,997
I just didn't imagine
that I'd be this nervous..

671
00:52:58,074 --> 00:52:59,371
..and you'd be this good looking..

672
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:10,009
Believe me.. I'll clean your
desk very creatively.

673
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:15,056
God knows, it needs
a good cleaning. So.

674
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:22,425
Sid! I've got it..

675
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:26,031
The new editor's assistant
at Mumbai Beat is Aisha Bannerjee!

676
00:53:26,636 --> 00:53:28,103
I finally have a job!

677
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:31,240
Aisha.. that's great.. Super!

678
00:53:33,443 --> 00:53:37,174
Can I call you in a bit?
I'm a little busy right now..

679
00:53:38,315 --> 00:53:40,374
Okay. Bye.

680
00:53:49,793 --> 00:53:53,058
What?! Stressed spelled
backwards is desserts.

681
00:53:53,129 --> 00:53:55,063
I'm stressed!
And where were you guys?!

682
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:56,189
Never on time..

683
00:53:56,266 --> 00:54:01,260
Baby, I passed I passed!
I got more than 40 in every subject!!

684
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:04,535
I thought I'd get like 35!
I'm so happy I passed!

685
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:06,132
Neha, that's like.. third class..

686
00:54:06,209 --> 00:54:09,736
Whatever, at least I passed.
Come on hurry up you guys..

687
00:54:11,348 --> 00:54:12,406
Excuse me..

688
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:15,343
Guys, excuse me.
- Let me see if I've passed or failed.

689
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:22,748
As per plan.. one by one.. OK?

690
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:24,217
You go first.

691
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:25,352
Sure? Ok..

692
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,096
Here.. here.

693
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:41,242
You're a genius Laxmi!
You're probably one of the toppers.

694
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:43,370
I don't know, man.
I could've done better in Economics..

695
00:54:47,183 --> 00:54:48,241
Where's mine.

696
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:54,118
Please God, let me pass
this one last time.

697
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:56,249
I'll walk barefoot to the temple
every week if you do. Please..

698
00:54:57,527 --> 00:55:03,261
Hey Rishi.. you did it!
You passed!

699
00:55:05,201 --> 00:55:07,726
I passed Sid! I passed!

700
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:11,602
Sid, let's check yours now..

701
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:14,401
Sid..

702
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:33,290
Maybe we're looking at the
wrong number, lets check again..

703
00:55:34,297 --> 00:55:35,355
Show me your exam card..

704
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:37,491
Sid.. Sid.

705
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,303
Where have you been?

706
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:53,843
Baby you passed!
Aren't you proud of yourself?

707
00:55:53,917 --> 00:55:55,248
I know baby.. But..

708
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,247
Sid!

709
00:56:00,323 --> 00:56:06,592
Sid! Don't worry dude.
It's going to be alright.

710
00:56:07,664 --> 00:56:08,722
Sid, listen.

711
00:56:09,933 --> 00:56:11,264
These things happen, Sid..

712
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:18,206
It's just one year, Sid.
You'll pass next year..

713
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:20,269
It's not that big a deal!

714
00:56:20,343 --> 00:56:21,401
Damn you, Rishi!

715
00:56:22,412 --> 00:56:25,279
Don't tell me that its not a
big deal just because you passed!

716
00:56:26,349 --> 00:56:27,475
I don't need a lecture from you.

717
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:30,542
Okay Sid, but relax Sid..

718
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:31,678
How can you tell me to relax?

719
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:33,749
I thought we were in this together.

720
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:40,359
Now you've gone and passed
and I've.. I'm alone here.

721
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:45,493
Yeah but.. why are you
taking this out on me?

722
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:47,433
Because it's all your fault!

723
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:50,368
You didn't deserve to pass either,
and you know it!

724
00:56:51,374 --> 00:56:53,501
Maybe if I hadn't wasted my time with you,
I would have passed too.

725
00:56:55,378 --> 00:56:56,640
Screw you Sid..

726
00:56:56,713 --> 00:56:58,305
Yeah right, screw you too Rishi!

727
00:56:58,381 --> 00:57:00,713
Stop fighting guys..
Sid we could reevaluate the papers..

728
00:57:00,784 --> 00:57:01,842
Laxmi please leave me alone.

729
00:57:17,534 --> 00:57:21,664
Siddy.. me cooking tonight.
Are you eating at home?

730
00:57:23,339 --> 00:57:24,397
What happen, Siddy?

731
00:57:25,341 --> 00:57:28,276
Are you in a bad mood?
Do you need money?

732
00:57:33,683 --> 00:57:34,741
What happened?

733
00:57:36,486 --> 00:57:39,353
Maa.. My results are out.

734
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:53,426
Sid? You didn't passed?

735
00:57:58,441 --> 00:58:00,432
How could you let this happen,
Sidharth?!

736
00:58:02,378 --> 00:58:04,778
This is because you
waste all your time roaming around..

737
00:58:04,848 --> 00:58:06,577
..with your friends!

738
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,515
You were such
a good student in school..

739
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:12,382
What happened in college?

740
00:58:13,456 --> 00:58:15,651
We give you everything
you want, don't we?

741
00:58:16,526 --> 00:58:21,725
Then why?
Say something Sidharth..

742
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:24,863
Did I do something wrong..
you failed.

743
00:58:24,934 --> 00:58:28,392
Shut up Ma! Stop this
stupid melodramatic lecture!

744
00:58:29,539 --> 00:58:32,337
I know exactly what happened.
There's no need to keep reminding me.

745
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:35,400
I'll pass next year.
Why are you panicking?

746
00:58:36,412 --> 00:58:38,539
Why do you care so much anyway?

747
00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:40,349
You didn't even go to school..

748
00:58:48,892 --> 00:58:49,950
Say you're sorry, Sid..

749
00:58:52,095 --> 00:58:53,562
I said apologize, Sidharth.

750
00:58:53,963 --> 00:58:56,363
Please don't interfere in this, Dad.

751
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,428
Don't interfere?

752
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:03,369
And continue to ignore what an ungrateful..

753
00:59:03,439 --> 00:59:04,497
..spoilt brat you've become!

754
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,967
How dare you speak
to your mother like that!

755
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:10,838
Her life has revolved
around you every single day of..

756
00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:12,438
..the last twenty years.

757
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:16,784
She couldn't go to school,
so she wanted you to do well.

758
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:20,448
So you could get everything
she couldn't have..

759
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:22,514
Wow! Another lecture..

760
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:26,053
Sid! Don't you dare walk out!

761
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:30,388
You are going to stand there
and listen to me tonight.

762
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:36,464
When I was your age
my father had died,

763
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:42,407
I was married, and working day and night,
trying to make enough money

764
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:47,415
so that you can have
everything you have today.

765
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:49,609
This lifestyle.. this arrogance..

766
00:59:49,686 --> 00:59:52,416
So what do you want from me?
Do you want me to be grateful?

767
00:59:52,488 --> 00:59:55,480
You're damn right.
The least you can do is be grateful!

768
00:59:55,558 --> 00:59:57,549
Thank you so much, Pa.
There, I said it.

769
00:59:57,627 --> 00:59:58,685
Now can I go?

770
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:01,821
I am not done yet!
You can't just walk away from everything!

771
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:04,957
This is exactly why you failed.

772
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:07,435
Why you didn't last at the office
for more than a week!

773
01:00:07,503 --> 01:00:08,902
You ran away without
informing anyone.

774
01:00:08,972 --> 01:00:12,499
Oh God.. Not again..
your office.. your company..

775
01:00:12,909 --> 01:00:14,843
Can't you see? I don't care
about your stupid office!

776
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:16,842
Then what do you care about Sidharth?

777
01:00:17,513 --> 01:00:19,447
What? You don't care about yourself..

778
01:00:19,515 --> 01:00:22,450
..about your family, about your future..

779
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:25,845
You're wasting your life Sidharth.

780
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:28,857
Can't you see that today
you've failed your exams..

781
01:00:28,925 --> 01:00:30,119
Tomorrow you're going to fail at life?

782
01:00:30,193 --> 01:00:32,718
No I can't see that!
And I don't want to see that!

783
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:35,061
I don't give a damn
about what you think!

784
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:38,532
You'll start caring
when I stop giving you money.

785
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:41,729
Do it then! I don't want
your bloody money anyway!

786
01:00:42,538 --> 01:00:47,066
Ok, Sidharth.
Let me clarify one thing.

787
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:54,141
This is MY house,
and if you want to live in it..

788
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:58,609
..you'll have to live by my rules. Ok?

789
01:01:00,757 --> 01:01:03,021
I don't want to live in your
damn house then! I'm leaving.

790
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:38,593
"No one is with me today. "

791
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:44,588
"I have to Iive up to my Iittle dream. "

792
01:01:47,603 --> 01:01:51,801
"This day has passed by. "

793
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:57,207
"There's solitude around me again. "

794
01:01:58,681 --> 01:02:01,616
"Let's go from here. "

795
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:21,562
Sid? What are you doing here?

796
01:02:23,773 --> 01:02:24,967
Can I stay with you?

797
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:31,647
What? Sid?
Ok, why don't come i n first..

798
01:02:40,323 --> 01:02:41,585
What's wrong, Sid?

799
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:49,253
Thank you Aisha..

800
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:52,385
Good night Sid..

801
01:04:06,609 --> 01:04:10,670
Chhotu! Chhotu!

802
01:04:13,016 --> 01:04:14,677
Shut these bloody curtains, Chhotu!!

803
01:04:15,952 --> 01:04:17,010
Chhotu!!

804
01:05:23,086 --> 01:05:24,417
Kabir overlooks all the writing..

805
01:05:25,622 --> 01:05:26,680
I'm so sorry..

806
01:05:28,091 --> 01:05:32,084
So whenever the articles come in..

807
01:05:36,499 --> 01:05:40,094
Aisha! Where were you?
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

808
01:05:42,705 --> 01:05:43,763
Were you so busy?

809
01:05:45,642 --> 01:05:46,904
I tried and tried and tried..

810
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:55,112
I got so bored today.

811
01:05:56,586 --> 01:05:58,918
And you should really get an AC..
it's so hot in here!

812
01:06:02,926 --> 01:06:04,120
Aisha, you're not even listening to me!

813
01:06:05,395 --> 01:06:08,125
Sid, I was working all day.
I'm really tired, ok?

814
01:06:10,066 --> 01:06:13,126
Ok.. Iet's go out for dinner then.

815
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:16,733
I don't want to go, Sid.
I ate at the office.

816
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:18,933
I just need to clean this up, and..

817
01:06:20,410 --> 01:06:24,141
You ate already? Without me?

818
01:06:24,747 --> 01:06:26,806
Yeah! You're not my husband!

819
01:06:27,083 --> 01:06:29,677
Just cook something for yourself,
I'm going to bed.

820
01:06:33,890 --> 01:06:35,949
You don't know how to cook, do you?

821
01:06:38,695 --> 01:06:42,825
You can't cook anything?
Then what did you eat today?

822
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:46,825
Shit, Sid, you haven't anything all day?!

823
01:06:47,103 --> 01:06:48,434
Why didn't you just order something?

824
01:06:49,105 --> 01:06:51,164
I didn't feel like it..

825
01:06:53,443 --> 01:06:54,501
Hungry?

826
01:06:56,579 --> 01:06:57,637
Yeah..

827
01:06:57,914 --> 01:06:59,779
You're so silly, Sid!
Why didn't you tell me!

828
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:01,107
I'll make you something.

829
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:13,594
"This is strange story. "

830
01:07:15,198 --> 01:07:18,599
"Where it starts and where it ends. "

831
01:07:20,136 --> 01:07:23,594
"Which destination is this?"

832
01:07:23,806 --> 01:07:24,932
Aisha, my coffee..

833
01:07:31,214 --> 01:07:32,476
Yes, just a second.

834
01:07:36,219 --> 01:07:40,747
Kabir.. I wrote this
and wanted your feedback..

835
01:07:40,957 --> 01:07:42,015
If you get a moment..

836
01:07:42,225 --> 01:07:43,522
Aisha, can I please get my coffee?

837
01:07:59,709 --> 01:08:00,767
Pizza.

838
01:08:03,112 --> 01:08:04,170
Don't worry.

839
01:08:05,848 --> 01:08:08,510
This treat, I'll pay.

840
01:08:15,992 --> 01:08:18,586
Sir, your card has been declined..

841
01:08:20,997 --> 01:08:22,055
Are you sure?

842
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:23,256
Yes sir.

843
01:08:25,668 --> 01:08:27,533
Would you like to pay cash?

844
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:29,662
Yes.

845
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:36,736
Actually..

846
01:08:36,813 --> 01:08:38,280
That's ok.. I'll get it..

847
01:08:39,816 --> 01:08:41,807
Debbie, that's really sweet ofyou..

848
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:44,813
Thank you so much.
I'll pay you back..

849
01:08:44,887 --> 01:08:45,945
Sidharth it's Ok.

850
01:08:46,155 --> 01:08:49,283
Save the grateful speech for another time.
It doesn't suit you.

851
01:08:51,894 --> 01:08:55,694
Anyway, I just got a job
so I'm treating all my friends to lunch.

852
01:08:57,633 --> 01:09:00,295
Not exactly friends, are we?

853
01:09:01,704 --> 01:09:02,762
No.. Not exactly..

854
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:10,310
I'm sorry that you failed, Sidharth.
Just wanted to say that.

855
01:09:12,315 --> 01:09:15,978
Hey Debbie,
why do you hate me so much?

856
01:09:19,922 --> 01:09:22,982
Three years ago,
I came to Bombay to join our college.

857
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:26,328
I had the right grades,
but I was late with my application.

858
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:30,329
I didn't get in that year. You know why?

859
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:33,066
Because you took my seat, Sidharth.

860
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:37,738
Your father called a few people,
and you got the last seat in the batch.

861
01:09:41,144 --> 01:09:47,344
I am smarter, I work harder,
and I'm more deserving than you.

862
01:09:48,951 --> 01:09:52,944
But life has always been easier for you,
hasn't it?

863
01:09:55,825 --> 01:09:56,883
Bye, Sid.

864
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,117
But Sid,
you have to go home some time!

865
01:10:26,389 --> 01:10:28,653
He cancelled my credit card, Laxmi.

866
01:10:29,125 --> 01:10:30,683
There's no way l' m going back now.

867
01:10:30,793 --> 01:10:33,057
But he's just angry, Sid.
You need to understand..

868
01:10:33,262 --> 01:10:35,696
You're the one
who doesn't understand, Laxmi!

869
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:36,924
You topped the whole damn college.

870
01:10:36,999 --> 01:10:39,058
How can you know
what it feels like to have failed?

871
01:10:39,335 --> 01:10:40,393
Just leave me alone!

872
01:10:41,671 --> 01:10:46,199
Oh Shut up, Sid!
I don't know what it feels like to fail?!

873
01:10:46,342 --> 01:10:49,209
Look at me.. I'm fat as a whale!

874
01:10:49,879 --> 01:10:55,875
I keep trying to lose weight
but I fail every single day!

875
01:10:56,819 --> 01:11:00,277
You're not the only one with problems,
so stop being a jerk!

876
01:11:09,031 --> 01:11:11,693
Wipe that silly look off your face!

877
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:19,840
Ok, fine.. I know I'm being a jerk!

878
01:11:20,843 --> 01:11:21,901
It's just been tough, you know..

879
01:11:23,312 --> 01:11:27,442
I know. That's why I got this for you.

880
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:31,715
College application form.

881
01:11:34,724 --> 01:11:35,782
And..

882
01:11:36,859 --> 01:11:37,917
Some of your things.

883
01:11:40,997 --> 01:11:42,862
I knew you wouldn't go back home.

884
01:11:43,199 --> 01:11:44,996
Just thought I'd try..

885
01:11:48,471 --> 01:11:52,339
Hey Laxmi.. I never knew, you know..

886
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:55,404
That your weight was such an issue
for you..

887
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:58,204
It's ok, Sid.

888
01:12:00,816 --> 01:12:03,341
You know
I don't think you're a whale, right?

889
01:12:06,756 --> 01:12:07,814
Maybe a shark!

890
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:16,091
Ma, no!

891
01:13:00,543 --> 01:13:05,276
"You are angry,
but I know, you'II be okay. "

892
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:09,548
"You are very good from heart. "

893
01:13:10,086 --> 01:13:11,348
Right there! Yeah hold it!

894
01:13:11,821 --> 01:13:16,554
"Life, you are just Iike me. "

895
01:13:17,093 --> 01:13:20,551
"You Iook smart, but naive. "

896
01:13:22,565 --> 01:13:26,968
"Why are you sitting far..

897
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:32,571
.. forgetting everything? "

898
01:13:33,576 --> 01:13:39,105
"Hold my finger. "

899
01:13:39,181 --> 01:13:43,584
"Walk with me..

900
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:49,047
..wherever I go. "

901
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:54,593
"Walk with you..

902
01:13:55,598 --> 01:13:59,591
..wherever I go. "

903
01:14:02,004 --> 01:14:03,198
Sonia?

904
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:05,998
Yes Sid?

905
01:14:07,009 --> 01:14:08,203
Do you know how to make eggs?

906
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:20,482
And call Karan and follow up with Amit.

907
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:21,948
Is that all?

908
01:14:22,224 --> 01:14:23,623
Yeah, just get rid of all this stuff.

909
01:14:29,031 --> 01:14:31,625
Aisha, leave.

910
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:35,630
"Walk with me..

911
01:14:37,173 --> 01:14:41,439
..wherever I go. "

912
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:47,048
"Walk with you..

913
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:52,653
..wherever I go. "

914
01:14:55,391 --> 01:14:56,517
Hi.
- Hi.

915
01:14:56,659 --> 01:14:57,921
You'll never believe this..

916
01:15:01,397 --> 01:15:03,922
Why are so late today? I was waiting!

917
01:15:07,269 --> 01:15:09,999
I made an egg for you!
Sonia taught me.

918
01:15:10,206 --> 01:15:11,673
You were right, she's so cool..

919
01:15:11,941 --> 01:15:14,967
Shut up Sid! Look at this mess..

920
01:15:15,945 --> 01:15:19,278
You made an egg.
Wow! Congratulations!

921
01:15:19,415 --> 01:15:21,975
And who is going to do those dishes?!
Your servant?

922
01:15:22,418 --> 01:15:24,079
Or did you forget,
you don't have a servant anymore?!

923
01:15:24,687 --> 01:15:30,148
This is my home Sid,
and you have turned it into a garbage dump!

924
01:15:32,294 --> 01:15:33,420
But Aisha.. I made you an egg..

925
01:17:37,252 --> 01:17:39,584
"Wake up!"

926
01:17:43,258 --> 01:17:46,250
"Wake up!"

927
01:17:49,330 --> 01:17:52,322
"Wake up!"

928
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:27,895
Sid.. I think you should go back home.

929
01:18:28,703 --> 01:18:30,762
Your dad has such a successful company..

930
01:18:31,706 --> 01:18:34,675
And you are sitting in my house
making eggs!

931
01:18:35,777 --> 01:18:36,903
What are you doing Sid?

932
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:45,250
You know.. You look at me
and you see my father's success..

933
01:18:46,654 --> 01:18:50,784
But I'm not like him, Aisha..
I went to his office for a week..

934
01:18:50,992 --> 01:18:54,393
But that place.. it just wasn't ME!

935
01:18:57,932 --> 01:19:05,395
But I'm beginning to realize
I'm nobody without him.

936
01:19:07,208 --> 01:19:13,408
I don't have an identity!

937
01:19:16,818 --> 01:19:21,687
Which is why I decided last night
that I want to work.

938
01:19:24,292 --> 01:19:25,691
I know that I can't do anything.

939
01:19:26,427 --> 01:19:27,951
I don't know who would hire me.

940
01:19:30,698 --> 01:19:32,097
All I know is that I want to work.

941
01:19:35,970 --> 01:19:38,438
Please don't kick me out right now.

942
01:19:39,774 --> 01:19:43,437
Just give me one more chance. Please.

943
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:50,108
Ok, Sid.

944
01:20:01,195 --> 01:20:03,186
Aisha, where were you last night?

945
01:20:04,399 --> 01:20:05,457
At Sonia's.

946
01:20:06,868 --> 01:20:12,465
You mean.. across the hall? Damn!

947
01:20:15,476 --> 01:20:18,274
Sid, about that job.. I've got an idea.

948
01:20:25,086 --> 01:20:26,485
Have you done any kind
of photography course?

949
01:20:28,756 --> 01:20:29,814
No..

950
01:20:29,891 --> 01:20:31,483
Any kind of work experience
with photography?

951
01:20:33,027 --> 01:20:34,085
No..

952
01:20:34,962 --> 01:20:36,224
Any kind of work experience at all?

953
01:20:39,233 --> 01:20:41,497
Amit, Sid's been taking photographs
for many years now.

954
01:20:41,903 --> 01:20:44,497
Even as an intern,
he could learn a lot from you.

955
01:20:45,239 --> 01:20:47,173
I truly think this is something
he'll be good at.

956
01:20:50,111 --> 01:20:54,912
Ok Sidharth.. Let's try you out
as an intern for a few days..

957
01:20:58,386 --> 01:20:59,444
Thanks Amit.

958
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,385
See you at 1 0 tomorrow.

959
01:21:03,191 --> 01:21:06,456
But tomorrow is Sunday!
I mean, yeah..

960
01:21:07,061 --> 01:21:08,119
Cool.

961
01:21:10,465 --> 01:21:12,194
I am going to be working
at Mumbai Beat.

962
01:21:12,467 --> 01:21:17,404
How totally neat! Hey, that rhymed.
Oh what heat!

963
01:21:18,072 --> 01:21:20,540
We live together,
now we're going to work together.

964
01:21:21,209 --> 01:21:22,267
Should we just get married?!

965
01:21:22,343 --> 01:21:24,538
Yeah, let's go! Come on!

966
01:21:24,946 --> 01:21:26,208
Go home, you idiot!

967
01:21:27,482 --> 01:21:28,813
4th Road Juhu Scheme please.
- Bye.

968
01:21:32,286 --> 01:21:33,344
Sid!

969
01:21:35,890 --> 01:21:37,152
See you at home honey!

970
01:21:44,432 --> 01:21:45,490
Stop here.

971
01:21:53,508 --> 01:21:55,567
Why did you bring me here? I said..

972
01:21:58,179 --> 01:21:59,441
Sorry..

973
01:21:59,580 --> 01:22:01,241
Turn around. We'll go to Chapel road.

974
01:22:05,319 --> 01:22:08,049
One second.
Wait here, I'll be right back.

975
01:22:29,143 --> 01:22:31,611
Really..

976
01:22:32,346 --> 01:22:36,612
He listened to the conversation between..

977
01:22:37,285 --> 01:22:43,019
The Chief of guard
and the king with great attention.

978
01:22:44,225 --> 01:22:49,629
Why? What did the poor fellow do?
The King inquired.

979
01:22:54,168 --> 01:22:58,104
Hello everybody, welcome to Mumbai Beat!
- Thank you.

980
01:22:59,974 --> 01:23:02,909
The theme of our next issue is
Bazaars of Mumbai.

981
01:23:03,978 --> 01:23:07,311
I'm sure you guys know all about them..

982
01:23:07,582 --> 01:23:08,640
Sir..
- And..

983
01:23:09,517 --> 01:23:13,317
The idea is that there will be two interns
for every three articles,

984
01:23:13,521 --> 01:23:16,649
except for the cover story.
So let's get down to work..

985
01:23:17,325 --> 01:23:19,122
You're Ram Mehra's son, right?

986
01:23:20,194 --> 01:23:23,925
We met at your parents' anniversary party,
remember?

987
01:23:25,466 --> 01:23:26,933
Oh yeah.. Hi.

988
01:23:33,274 --> 01:23:37,335
So, I'm guessing you didn't join
your dad's company then..

989
01:23:37,411 --> 01:23:39,675
Tanya Lathia? Design in turn.

990
01:23:40,147 --> 01:23:41,205
That's me.

991
01:23:41,282 --> 01:23:42,340
Sid Mehra?

992
01:23:42,416 --> 01:23:45,681
You two are going to assist me
on the cover story photo spread.

993
01:23:46,554 --> 01:23:47,612
And you are?
- Rasha.

994
01:23:47,955 --> 01:23:50,082
Rasha.. you are also design in turn.

995
01:23:50,291 --> 01:23:52,088
What do you want to do?
What you want to design?

996
01:23:53,961 --> 01:23:56,429
Sid?! Hold on, l' m coming..

997
01:23:59,166 --> 01:24:00,224
Yes?

998
01:24:00,501 --> 01:24:01,559
Aisha?

999
01:24:01,636 --> 01:24:02,694
Yes.

1000
01:24:03,704 --> 01:24:05,103
I'm Sidharth's mother.

1001
01:24:06,707 --> 01:24:09,642
Oh.. Hello auntie..

1002
01:24:10,511 --> 01:24:11,637
Can I come in?

1003
01:24:12,246 --> 01:24:13,713
Of course, please come in.

1004
01:24:32,133 --> 01:24:33,464
Actually.. Sid isn't here..

1005
01:24:34,735 --> 01:24:39,138
I know. I had asked Chhotu
to call me once he left.

1006
01:24:41,075 --> 01:24:44,533
I just wanted to see
where Sid was living these days.

1007
01:24:47,348 --> 01:24:49,680
Now that he's staying with you..

1008
01:24:50,751 --> 01:24:52,218
I thought you might need some money..

1009
01:24:52,353 --> 01:24:55,083
No auntie, please..
I can't take money from you..

1010
01:24:56,023 --> 01:24:57,081
Thank you.

1011
01:24:59,627 --> 01:25:02,687
I brought some mangoes too..
they're Sidharth's favourite..

1012
01:25:03,564 --> 01:25:04,622
At least keep those.

1013
01:25:06,033 --> 01:25:07,091
Ok.

1014
01:25:08,035 --> 01:25:09,093
Chhotu!

1015
01:25:09,704 --> 01:25:10,762
Yes, put it here.

1016
01:25:11,706 --> 01:25:15,369
Just don't tell him I got them.
He won't like it.

1017
01:25:18,045 --> 01:25:20,707
Ok Aisha, I will take your leave.

1018
01:25:21,048 --> 01:25:22,106
Ok aunty.

1019
01:25:22,650 --> 01:25:23,708
Auntie..

1020
01:25:26,053 --> 01:25:27,714
I just wanted to say..

1021
01:25:29,056 --> 01:25:31,581
I mean,
I hope you don't get the wrong idea..

1022
01:25:32,593 --> 01:25:37,656
Actually, Sid and l,
there's nothing going on between us..

1023
01:25:38,733 --> 01:25:41,258
We're.. we're just friends, you know..

1024
01:26:12,767 --> 01:26:18,171
"Life, these days.. "

1025
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:25,244
"..is telling me. "

1026
01:26:27,581 --> 01:26:32,848
"lfyou listen to me,
come with me to the lane of dreams. "

1027
01:26:34,455 --> 01:26:39,791
"Take all the fragrances
and brightness in your arms. "

1028
01:26:40,594 --> 01:26:44,121
"Wherever you are..

1029
01:26:44,265 --> 01:26:47,666
.. the days and nights are new. "

1030
01:26:47,735 --> 01:26:51,193
"New desires..

1031
01:26:51,472 --> 01:26:55,203
..and new emotions. "

1032
01:26:55,876 --> 01:27:01,280
"There are new ways for you,
why don't you go and explore?"

1033
01:27:01,749 --> 01:27:08,746
"There's new earth and new sky for you. "

1034
01:27:09,724 --> 01:27:16,288
"Write a new story on the winds. "

1035
01:27:16,831 --> 01:27:23,236
"There's new earth and new sky for you. "

1036
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:30,503
"Write a new story on the winds. "

1037
01:27:52,466 --> 01:28:00,874
"When Iife knocked;
heart opened all the windows. "

1038
01:28:02,476 --> 01:28:04,671
"Heart opened all the windows. "

1039
01:28:06,614 --> 01:28:15,215
"The solitude on the Iips has melted. "

1040
01:28:16,757 --> 01:28:18,748
"Has melted. "

1041
01:28:20,961 --> 01:28:26,490
"These moments have surprised me. "

1042
01:28:27,968 --> 01:28:33,565
"So many talks have touched my heart.. "

1043
01:28:34,508 --> 01:28:41,437
"Many desires have awakened in my heart. "

1044
01:28:41,582 --> 01:28:48,920
"Many desires have come to tell me. "

1045
01:28:49,857 --> 01:28:55,318
"Recognize the smile
and fill your heart with happiness. "

1046

1047
01:29:03,604 --> 01:29:10,009
"Write a new story on the winds. "

01:29:10,778 --> 01:29:17,013
"There's new earth and new sky for you. "

1049
01:29:17,852 --> 01:29:26,021
"Write a new story on the winds. "

1050
01:29:49,650 --> 01:29:52,050
Thank God we have tomorrow off.
I really need a break.

1051
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:54,319
Let's go out to dinner tonight.

1052
01:29:55,589 --> 01:29:58,057
I can't tonight.. I already made plans.

1053
01:29:58,993 --> 01:30:00,654
Really? What plans?

1054
01:30:01,061 --> 01:30:03,586
You know Tanya?
I'm going out with her.

1055
01:30:04,598 --> 01:30:09,535
Tanya? That design intern?
She's pretty, haan?

1056
01:30:10,571 --> 01:30:12,664
Yeah she's pretty.. and fun too.

1057
01:30:13,807 --> 01:30:16,332
We're going clubbing..
Why don't you join us?

1058
01:30:16,410 --> 01:30:17,468
It'll be fun!

1059
01:30:17,544 --> 01:30:19,409
No, you go.
I don't want to go clubbing.

1060
01:30:22,483 --> 01:30:24,348
But you'll get bored, all alone at home..

1061
01:30:25,085 --> 01:30:26,347
I'll just cancel the whole thing.

1062
01:30:26,487 --> 01:30:28,011
Don't be silly! You should go.

1063
01:30:28,389 --> 01:30:30,482
Don't worry about me.
I've got a lot going on.

1064
01:30:30,557 --> 01:30:31,615
Really!

1065
01:30:36,096 --> 01:30:39,623
Up for a drink?
I didn't have anything going on, so..

1066
01:30:40,034 --> 01:30:42,594
I'm always up for a drink darling!
Come.

1067
01:30:42,670 --> 01:30:44,365
Hi.

1068
01:30:45,039 --> 01:30:46,370
Hey, what's up?

1069
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:48,374
Sid, this is my best friend, Saira..

1070
01:30:48,442 --> 01:30:51,104
Hello! I've heard a lot about you!
- Oh, you have?

1071
01:30:51,378 --> 01:30:54,438
Tanya.. Vikram. Come here.

1072
01:30:54,648 --> 01:30:57,378
Sid man! - Bro.
- Where have you been?

1073
01:30:57,451 --> 01:30:58,509
Back in action now brother..

1074
01:30:58,585 --> 01:30:59,779
You totally disappeared..
- Actually..

1075
01:30:59,853 --> 01:31:01,912
Sid!! What are you doing here?

1076
01:31:01,989 --> 01:31:05,390
Wow, he knows everyone here..
Anyway, have you met Rishi?

1077
01:31:06,393 --> 01:31:07,519
Tanya! - Hey..
- Hi.

1078
01:31:08,395 --> 01:31:09,453
Yes.

1079
01:31:09,530 --> 01:31:11,122
Hi.

1080
01:31:14,668 --> 01:31:15,726
Hey Rish..

1081
01:31:15,803 --> 01:31:18,670
Hi Sid. Do you want another drink?

1082
01:31:18,739 --> 01:31:19,797
Yes please.

1083
01:31:20,140 --> 01:31:23,473
I hated when l..

1084
01:31:28,415 --> 01:31:29,609
What the hell are you watching?!

1085
01:31:29,817 --> 01:31:30,875
Hey..

1086
01:31:30,951 --> 01:31:34,011
Come, let's gossip..
How's your sex life?!

1087
01:31:34,955 --> 01:31:36,013
What?!

1088
01:31:36,423 --> 01:31:39,950
Oh don't be such a prude!
What about your boss?

1089
01:31:40,828 --> 01:31:44,025
How's that going?
Do you still think he's sexy?

1090
01:31:44,765 --> 01:31:45,823
Tell me.

1091
01:31:46,166 --> 01:31:50,159
Yep, still sexy..
and he's my type too..

1092
01:31:50,637 --> 01:31:51,695
Just jump him then!

1093
01:31:52,039 --> 01:31:54,769
Sonia! He's my boss!
And I don't even know him..

1094
01:31:56,110 --> 01:31:57,168
And Sid?

1095
01:31:57,845 --> 01:31:58,903
What about him?

1096
01:31:58,979 --> 01:32:01,846
You know him, don't you?
At least hook up with him!

1097
01:32:02,182 --> 01:32:05,777
Please Sonia! We're just friends.
Plus, he's a kid!

1098
01:32:06,453 --> 01:32:10,184
Oh what a cute kid!
I think he's quite sexy..

1099
01:32:10,891 --> 01:32:13,724
You know, like those boy band singers..

1100
01:32:14,194 --> 01:32:15,855
Sid? And sexy?

1101
01:32:15,929 --> 01:32:17,191
Yes.

1102
01:32:17,464 --> 01:32:18,522
Of course!

1103
01:32:18,599 --> 01:32:19,930
Please.. not Sid!

1104
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,058
Yeah!

1105
01:32:21,135 --> 01:32:22,193
Oh God!

1106
01:32:23,804 --> 01:32:25,465
Guys! Drinks?

1107
01:32:25,739 --> 01:32:26,797
Vodka Red Bull!

1108
01:32:27,074 --> 01:32:28,132
Oooooh!

1109
01:32:28,208 --> 01:32:29,675
Weird! I'll get them!

1110
01:32:33,614 --> 01:32:35,138
Sid!!!

1111
01:32:36,583 --> 01:32:38,141
Two Vodka Red Bulls please.

1112
01:32:42,489 --> 01:32:43,547
Laxmi?

1113
01:32:44,158 --> 01:32:45,216
Sid?

1114
01:32:45,826 --> 01:32:47,487
Where did Rishi go?

1115
01:32:48,495 --> 01:32:50,554
Why do you wanna know?
As if you care..

1116
01:32:51,498 --> 01:32:52,556
He left.

1117
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:54,831
Of course. For Neha's.

1118
01:32:55,235 --> 01:32:56,702
No Sid! Why would he go there?

1119
01:32:58,172 --> 01:32:59,230
Let it be.

1120
01:32:59,773 --> 01:33:01,172
What?
- Nothing..

1121
01:33:01,575 --> 01:33:02,633
Tell me.

1122
01:33:04,044 --> 01:33:11,780
Neha and Rishi broke up.
Nobody knows why or when..

1123
01:33:12,186 --> 01:33:13,915
And that stupid Rishi won't talk about it..

1124
01:33:15,522 --> 01:33:18,252
Poor thing. He's really upset.

1125
01:33:18,792 --> 01:33:19,850
You know how he is..

1126
01:33:28,535 --> 01:33:29,593
Hey Rish..

1127
01:33:31,138 --> 01:33:32,196
Why didn't you call me?

1128
01:33:36,877 --> 01:33:39,209
Rishi! What happened with Neha?

1129
01:33:42,549 --> 01:33:43,607
What happened man?!

1130
01:33:55,696 --> 01:33:58,631
You gotta be kidding me..
And she said no?

1131
01:34:00,834 --> 01:34:05,032
Not only that.. She dumped me, man..

1132
01:34:18,252 --> 01:34:19,583
I'm a bloody idiot!

1133
01:34:19,653 --> 01:34:20,711
You're a bloody idiot!

1134
01:34:21,321 --> 01:34:22,652
You told me this would happen!

1135
01:34:22,789 --> 01:34:24,188
I told you this would happen!

1136
01:34:24,625 --> 01:34:26,855
Then you should've been there
to remind me!

1137
01:34:34,268 --> 01:34:37,601
Yeah man. I should've been there.

1138
01:34:39,673 --> 01:34:40,731
Sorry.

1139
01:35:02,362 --> 01:35:04,353
Sanju, have breakfast.

1140
01:35:04,698 --> 01:35:05,756
Come on.

1141
01:35:12,372 --> 01:35:14,306
Aisha! Good morning.

1142
01:35:14,641 --> 01:35:15,699
Morning Sid.

1143
01:35:22,649 --> 01:35:25,379
Aisha? Why are we sitting
with the door open?

1144
01:35:26,987 --> 01:35:28,181
Cross ventilation, Sid.

1145
01:35:28,722 --> 01:35:30,986
There's no electricity in the flat.
It's really hot.

1146
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:36,252
Just a few more days..
and the rain will be here.

1147
01:35:37,931 --> 01:35:39,865
You don't know
how much you're going to love it.

1148
01:35:47,941 --> 01:35:48,999
Aisha?

1149
01:35:49,276 --> 01:35:50,334
What Sid?!

1150
01:35:51,411 --> 01:35:55,404
This dress really suits you.
You're looking nice today.

1151
01:35:57,684 --> 01:35:58,742
Don't I look nice everyday?

1152
01:36:00,687 --> 01:36:01,745
Nope.

1153
01:36:03,757 --> 01:36:06,157
No seriously..
you look a little extra nice today.

1154
01:36:07,694 --> 01:36:08,752
Thanks Sid.

1155
01:36:12,432 --> 01:36:16,163
Aisha.. Sidharth..
I made my special Sunday breakfast today.

1156
01:36:16,236 --> 01:36:17,294
Do you want some?

1157
01:36:17,371 --> 01:36:19,771
Yes, Mrs. Bapat. I'm always starving!

1158
01:36:20,841 --> 01:36:26,438
Umm Sidharth.. will you take
Sanju's photographs today? Please?

1159
01:36:26,947 --> 01:36:28,972
Of course, Mrs. Bapat.
Right after I polish off this food!

1160
01:36:29,983 --> 01:36:31,041
Tell me if you want more.

1161
01:36:31,118 --> 01:36:32,176
Sure.

1162
01:36:35,188 --> 01:36:36,246
Here.

1163
01:36:36,723 --> 01:36:37,781
Smile.

1164
01:36:39,426 --> 01:36:40,859
Smile for me, Sanju!

1165
01:36:42,729 --> 01:36:43,787
Can I go play now?

1166
01:36:44,197 --> 01:36:48,793
Come, we'll play together.
Do you like cricket?

1167
01:36:49,469 --> 01:36:50,936
Show me how you hit the ball!

1168
01:36:51,471 --> 01:36:56,807
Yeah! Once again. 1.. 2.. 3! Superb.

1169
01:37:04,885 --> 01:37:05,943
Thank you.

1170
01:37:06,019 --> 01:37:07,077
You're welcome, sir.

1171
01:37:08,755 --> 01:37:10,746
Sanju! Take one with just me and him,
Sidharth.

1172
01:37:10,824 --> 01:37:12,348
Sure.
- Come.

1173
01:37:12,959 --> 01:37:16,019
Sit here.

1174
01:37:18,765 --> 01:37:19,823
Smile Sanju!

1175
01:37:21,435 --> 01:37:23,835
What happened?

1176
01:37:27,507 --> 01:37:29,168
Why do you have to be so naughty, huh?

1177
01:37:29,309 --> 01:37:31,243
He's taking such nice pictures.

1178
01:37:31,511 --> 01:37:35,174
Always up to mischief, my little brat.

1179
01:38:13,086 --> 01:38:14,144
Hi ma.

1180
01:38:18,558 --> 01:38:21,959
Thought dad would be
on his evening walk now..

1181
01:38:23,830 --> 01:38:24,956
I'm going to leave before he gets back.

1182
01:38:27,501 --> 01:38:28,832
And I haven't come back to stay,

1183
01:38:29,970 --> 01:38:33,030
so we're not going to talk about that.
Ok?

1184
01:38:38,512 --> 01:38:41,242
I just.. wanted to see you.

1185
01:38:49,456 --> 01:38:50,514
I miss you ma..

1186
01:38:54,528 --> 01:38:58,464
Sid.. in shirt you looking so handsome..

1187
01:39:00,367 --> 01:39:05,862
Ma, I always look handsome.

1188
01:39:08,942 --> 01:39:10,136
That's true.

1189
01:39:19,619 --> 01:39:24,886
Siddy, you're 4 years old here..
It was your first day of iscool.

1190
01:39:25,892 --> 01:39:28,622
School Ma, not 'iscool', school.

1191
01:39:28,929 --> 01:39:30,362
That's what I said.. Iscool.

1192
01:39:31,631 --> 01:39:33,963
I have no idea
when you'll stop trying to speak English.

1193
01:39:34,968 --> 01:39:38,904
Why should l?
Maybe if I know English like your friends,

1194
01:39:38,972 --> 01:39:42,567
then we can become friends too.

1195
01:39:48,915 --> 01:39:53,045
Look at this one. You were so fat then!

1196
01:40:04,197 --> 01:40:05,528
Ma, you look stunning here!

1197
01:40:09,035 --> 01:40:11,060
These photographs are lovely..
who took them?

1198
01:40:11,605 --> 01:40:13,072
Your Dad did, who else?

1199
01:40:14,541 --> 01:40:17,009
Really? I'm surprised he found the time.

1200
01:40:17,611 --> 01:40:20,011
He always had time to take your pictures.

1201
01:40:20,647 --> 01:40:23,673
As soon as he got back from work,
you two would start.

1202
01:40:24,951 --> 01:40:27,215
He'd take pictures, and you would pose.

1203
01:40:28,088 --> 01:40:30,022
I thought you'd become an actor!

1204
01:40:32,025 --> 01:40:37,156
Really Sid, your father has really captured..

1205
01:40:37,230 --> 01:40:39,164
..your childhood in these albums.

1206
01:40:47,974 --> 01:40:50,169
Ma.. I should go..

1207
01:40:57,651 --> 01:41:02,054
Siddy, I hope you're eating properly..

1208
01:41:02,722 --> 01:41:05,054
Yes Ma. We're fine, managing.

1209
01:41:07,227 --> 01:41:08,990
And there's always the mangoes
that you send.

1210
01:41:10,997 --> 01:41:12,123
It was kinda obvious..

1211
01:41:21,007 --> 01:41:22,065
Bye..

1212
01:41:37,757 --> 01:41:43,218
I really want take a photograph
for the next issue.

1213
01:41:44,097 --> 01:41:48,557
I know I'm just an intern,
but I want to prove that I can do better.

1214
01:41:54,641 --> 01:41:57,235
'New Girl in the City'. Nice title.

1215
01:42:01,314 --> 01:42:03,646
You read my articles?! All of them?

1216
01:42:03,717 --> 01:42:07,244
I've decided that you're going to write
an article for the next issue.

1217
01:42:07,787 --> 01:42:10,119
If I like it, we'll make it a regular thing.

1218
01:42:11,658 --> 01:42:12,716
Thank you!

1219
01:42:12,792 --> 01:42:14,054
Your writing is fresh.

1220
01:42:14,127 --> 01:42:15,185
Really.

1221
01:42:15,729 --> 01:42:18,721
Thanks! Thank you!

1222
01:42:22,669 --> 01:42:24,068
Aisha..
- Yes.

1223
01:42:26,339 --> 01:42:29,137
I'm going to a jazz bar
with a couple of my friends tonight.

1224
01:42:29,209 --> 01:42:30,267
There's going to be a live performance.

1225
01:42:30,543 --> 01:42:31,601
It's going to be a nice evening.

1226
01:42:32,479 --> 01:42:33,605
Would to like to join me?

1227
01:42:36,149 --> 01:42:37,207
Yeah sure.

1228
01:43:02,776 --> 01:43:04,437
Unbelievable! Superb!

1229
01:43:04,511 --> 01:43:05,569
Wonderful.

1230
01:43:07,681 --> 01:43:09,171
What could be better than this, Aisha?

1231
01:43:14,788 --> 01:43:16,585
You haven't heard much jazz, have you?

1232
01:43:17,657 --> 01:43:19,420
No.. not really..

1233
01:43:20,126 --> 01:43:21,650
What kind of music do you like?

1234
01:43:23,129 --> 01:43:28,192
Umm, I don't know.. Old Hindi Film songs.

1235
01:43:29,602 --> 01:43:31,866
At least they're easy to sing along to.

1236
01:43:34,841 --> 01:43:37,401
You like Film music because it's easy?

1237
01:43:38,678 --> 01:43:39,736
Yeah..

1238
01:43:41,414 --> 01:43:42,472
Interesting.

1239
01:43:43,149 --> 01:43:44,207
What?

1240
01:43:46,152 --> 01:43:47,210
What?

1241
01:43:49,823 --> 01:43:52,189
You know, there's maturity in your writing..

1242
01:43:52,759 --> 01:43:56,286
But you're still a little childish.

1243
01:43:58,298 --> 01:44:01,893
Anyway, stick around with me
and you'll learn what real music is.

1244
01:44:16,916 --> 01:44:18,713
Aisha! Hi!

1245
01:44:19,519 --> 01:44:22,716
Tanya? Hi. What are you doing here?

1246
01:44:22,856 --> 01:44:24,847
I came to drop off some books.

1247
01:44:24,924 --> 01:44:26,391
Thought Sid might need them
for his new assignment.

1248
01:44:26,526 --> 01:44:27,720
He's so excited!

1249
01:44:28,194 --> 01:44:29,252
What new assignment?

1250
01:44:29,329 --> 01:44:30,387
You don't know?

1251
01:44:30,697 --> 01:44:33,860
Amit asked him to take a few photographs
for the next issue.

1252
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:35,258
Isn't that cool?

1253
01:44:35,802 --> 01:44:36,860
Yeah, it's cool.

1254
01:44:37,203 --> 01:44:38,795
Anyhow, gotta run now. Bye!

1255
01:44:38,872 --> 01:44:39,930
Bye.

1256
01:44:41,474 --> 01:44:43,942
By the way Aisha,
your place is so cute!

1257
01:44:46,212 --> 01:44:47,270
Thanks.

1258
01:45:00,860 --> 01:45:02,623
Hey.

1259
01:45:02,695 --> 01:45:06,722
Hi.

1260
01:45:09,502 --> 01:45:13,563
I'm starving. I think I'll cook something..
want some?

1261
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:16,731
I ate already. I made some pasta.

1262
01:45:17,443 --> 01:45:18,637
There's some in the fridge for you.

1263
01:45:19,913 --> 01:45:22,279
Oh God
I hope you cleaned up the kitchen!

1264
01:45:22,448 --> 01:45:24,939
You always make such a mess
when you cook..

1265
01:45:32,258 --> 01:45:34,249
You know,
I'm actually not that hungry.

1266
01:45:35,328 --> 01:45:39,264
I should change though.. it's so hot.

1267
01:45:40,867 --> 01:45:42,357
I haven't done laundry in days..

1268
01:45:42,869 --> 01:45:43,995
I don't know what I'm going to wear.

1269
01:45:44,804 --> 01:45:48,763
I washed your clothes along with mine.

1270
01:45:48,842 --> 01:45:54,007
They're in your cupboard.

1271
01:45:56,683 --> 01:45:59,277
Sid! You should have asked me
before washing my clothes!

1272
01:45:59,352 --> 01:46:02,287
I sleep in this white kurta
and I never wash it!

1273
01:46:02,355 --> 01:46:05,847
Washing ruins it and besides..
I like it being dirty!

1274
01:46:06,893 --> 01:46:08,292
Aisha what's wrong with you?

1275
01:46:09,295 --> 01:46:12,355
Instead of thanking me for washing
your clothes, you're yelling at me?!

1276
01:46:12,498 --> 01:46:15,899
Because I want to wash my own damn clothes
and cook my own damn food!

1277
01:46:16,302 --> 01:46:18,293
This doesn't even feel like
my house anymore!

1278
01:46:18,571 --> 01:46:20,971
I don't like it when you do my work or..

1279
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:23,372
..when you call strange girls into my house!

1280
01:46:26,713 --> 01:46:29,739
You have lost your mind!
I think the heat has gotten to your head!

1281
01:46:29,816 --> 01:46:31,909
Of course it has!

1282
01:46:32,318 --> 01:46:34,650
So what can I do?
Make the heavens rain for you?

1283
01:46:34,721 --> 01:46:36,712
Why not?-Now that you're so efficient
at everything..

1284
01:46:36,789 --> 01:46:37,949
Iets see you do this too!

1285
01:46:38,024 --> 01:46:39,514
Here's your rain!

1286
01:46:43,329 --> 01:46:45,320
I can't believe you just did that!

1287
01:46:45,398 --> 01:46:47,764
Aisha you'll ruin my iPod!!

1288
01:46:47,834 --> 01:46:52,328
Shit sorry sorry.. Sid!!
Stop it, you idiot!

1289
01:46:53,339 --> 01:46:54,397
Okay. Okay.

1290
01:47:09,355 --> 01:47:12,051
Aisha.. are you Ok?

1291
01:47:12,759 --> 01:47:15,353
I'm sorry, I was just kidding..

1292
01:47:15,628 --> 01:47:20,361
It's Ok.

1293
01:47:20,433 --> 01:47:26,668
I am sorry, Aisha.

1294
01:47:43,523 --> 01:47:44,581
You sure you're Ok?

1295
01:47:45,124 --> 01:47:46,386
Yeah.

1296
01:47:46,993 --> 01:47:48,051
Ok then!

1297
01:47:48,995 --> 01:47:52,590
Enough Sid! Don't behave like a kid.

1298
01:48:29,168 --> 01:48:34,834
Sid.. if you keep helping me like this,
I'll get used to it.

1299
01:48:35,908 --> 01:48:36,966
So?

1300
01:48:38,111 --> 01:48:41,569
So it's not right.
What will I do when you're gone?

1301
01:48:43,449 --> 01:48:44,507
I'm not going anywhere.

1302
01:48:48,121 --> 01:48:49,748
Come now. The food's getting cold..

1303
01:48:51,457 --> 01:48:56,724
"O heart, you are crazy. "

1304
01:48:57,597 --> 01:49:02,694
"Only you know what you think?"

1305
01:49:03,536 --> 01:49:08,473
"Only you know what you think?"

1306
01:49:08,674 --> 01:49:14,476
"Why do you show me dreams all the time?"

1307
01:49:14,947 --> 01:49:18,474
"When dreams shower drop by drop. "

1308
01:49:18,618 --> 01:49:23,988
"Close your eyes. "
-"Close your eyes. "

1309
01:49:24,057 --> 01:49:27,493
"When dreams shower drop by drop. "

1310
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:30,495
"Close your eyes. "

1311
01:49:30,563 --> 01:49:36,160
"How can I walk?
I can't see unknown ways. "

1312
01:49:36,235 --> 01:49:39,170
"Like the string instrument plays. "

1313
01:49:39,238 --> 01:49:41,604
"Like the string instrument plays. "

1314
01:49:42,175 --> 01:49:45,144
"Like the string instrument plays. "

1315
01:49:45,211 --> 01:49:48,180
"Like the string instrument plays. "

1316
01:49:48,247 --> 01:49:51,114
"Like the string instrument plays. "

1317
01:49:51,184 --> 01:49:53,744
"Like the string instrument plays. "

1318
01:49:54,120 --> 01:49:57,146
"Like the string instrument plays. "

1319
01:49:57,223 --> 01:49:59,748
"Like the string instrument plays. "

1320
01:50:24,550 --> 01:50:30,546
"I am Iistening to a story completely Iost. "

1321
01:50:30,723 --> 01:50:36,252
"Who knows it is full story or not. "

1322
01:50:36,629 --> 01:50:42,568
"I didn't even realize
even after becoming someone's..

1323
01:50:42,635 --> 01:50:47,231
.. that it is for some moments or life time. "

1324
01:50:47,306 --> 01:50:50,901
"Who knows. "

1325
01:50:51,644 --> 01:50:54,841
"Who knows. "

1326
01:50:58,651 --> 01:51:07,582
"When dreams shower drop by drop. "

1327
01:51:07,660 --> 01:51:13,826
"Close your eyes. "
- "Close your eyes. "

1328
01:51:14,100 --> 01:51:17,092
"When dreams shower drop by drop. "

1329
01:51:17,170 --> 01:51:20,606
"How can I walk?
I can't see unknown ways. "

1330
01:51:27,146 --> 01:51:28,204
What's up?

1331
01:51:30,082 --> 01:51:33,108
Sid.. I' m really worried about my article..

1332
01:51:34,954 --> 01:51:36,819
Why? I'm sure it'll be great.

1333
01:51:37,890 --> 01:51:38,948
How do you know?

1334
01:51:40,626 --> 01:51:41,888
I just know.

1335
01:51:44,297 --> 01:51:47,289
"Like the string instrument plays. "

1336
01:51:47,366 --> 01:51:49,834
"Like the string instrument plays. "

1337
01:51:50,236 --> 01:51:53,296
"Like the string instrument plays. "

1338
01:51:53,372 --> 01:51:56,239
"Like the string instrument plays. "

1339
01:51:56,309 --> 01:51:59,301
"Like the string instrument plays. "

1340
01:51:59,378 --> 01:52:01,903
"Like the string instrument plays. "

1341
01:52:02,248 --> 01:52:05,308
"Like the string instrument plays. "

1342
01:52:05,384 --> 01:52:07,978
"Like the string instrument plays. "

1343
01:52:19,665 --> 01:52:23,157
Nice. Just proofread it once
before you submit it.

1344
01:52:23,236 --> 01:52:24,999
Thanks. Can I take off now?

1345
01:52:25,271 --> 01:52:31,335
One second, Aisha.
I have two tickets for a jazz concert tonight.

1346
01:52:31,410 --> 01:52:32,672
And you're coming with me.

1347
01:52:41,187 --> 01:52:43,678
No Kabir. I can't come.

1348
01:52:46,892 --> 01:52:52,694
You know, I thought if I spent time with you,
I'd start enjoying jazz..

1349
01:52:54,300 --> 01:52:58,134
But, the truth is, I just don't like jazz.

1350
01:52:59,238 --> 01:53:00,705
I'm sorry but it's just not me.

1351
01:53:05,111 --> 01:53:06,237
So.. I'll see you at work tomorrow?

1352
01:53:11,450 --> 01:53:17,719
"This evening Iooks empty. "

1353
01:53:18,224 --> 01:53:22,718
Sid! I've selected one of your photographs
for the next issue.

1354
01:53:24,130 --> 01:53:25,995
Thanks..
- Thank me later.

1355
01:53:26,265 --> 01:53:27,789
Just get drunk for now.

1356
01:53:29,001 --> 01:53:32,198
Have fun! You're doing well.

1357
01:53:34,407 --> 01:53:36,875
"I find everyone.."

1358
01:53:36,942 --> 01:53:38,000
Hey!

1359
01:53:41,480 --> 01:53:48,113
"The silence is around.
The ambience is glittering. "

1360
01:53:52,992 --> 01:53:57,224
"These moments are here today. "

1361
01:53:57,296 --> 01:54:00,754
Ladies and gentlemen!
I'm Sidharth Mehra from Mumbai Beat.

1362
01:54:03,502 --> 01:54:07,438
On the dru ms we have Laxmi..
and this is my friend Rishi.

1363
01:54:07,506 --> 01:54:08,803
Thank you, thank you.

1364
01:54:09,308 --> 01:54:12,004
And this is our favorite song. Hit it!

1365
01:54:12,078 --> 01:54:14,774
Dude, not me not me!

1366
01:54:16,048 --> 01:54:17,106
Go Sid!

1367
01:54:18,451 --> 01:54:22,888
"First Iove and first.."

1368
01:54:23,322 --> 01:54:25,290
Sid's crazy, isn't he?

1369
01:54:25,791 --> 01:54:27,258
Oh he was much crazier before!

1370
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:30,394
You can't even imagine the things
we've done!

1371
01:54:30,463 --> 01:54:32,294
"What state I've come to. "

1372
01:54:32,798 --> 01:54:36,325
"Restless heart.. " - Go Sid!
- "Restless heart.. "

1373
01:54:36,402 --> 01:54:38,097
And now?
- Now?

1374
01:54:38,404 --> 01:54:41,032
Now he doesn't have time for us!

1375
01:54:41,107 --> 01:54:46,306
New job.. new friends.. you know?

1376
01:54:50,416 --> 01:54:53,817
"You tell me. "

1377
01:54:54,553 --> 01:55:00,150
"First Iove and first.. "

1378
01:55:02,094 --> 01:55:03,254
Doesn't that make you feel bad?

1379
01:55:06,999 --> 01:55:10,833
Are you kidding? Of course it does.
But it's Ok.

1380
01:55:12,037 --> 01:55:17,031
Sid mig ht have changed a lot..
but it's all for the better.

1381
01:55:17,109 --> 01:55:22,513
"Restless heart.
- You tell me. "

1382
01:55:24,116 --> 01:55:25,981
"You tell me. "

1383
01:55:35,327 --> 01:55:39,855
You're really drunk Sid.
You should go to bed.

1384
01:55:49,542 --> 01:55:50,600
Sid?

1385
01:55:56,882 --> 01:55:57,940
Are you Ok?

1386
01:58:07,012 --> 01:58:09,003
I know we're not talking to each other..

1387
01:58:10,616 --> 01:58:12,015
And that you're still angry.

1388
01:58:14,086 --> 01:58:19,422
But I thought that you would call one day
and ask me to come back home.

1389
01:58:22,294 --> 01:58:23,352
But.. you never did.

1390
01:58:26,098 --> 01:58:32,037
So I decided that I wouldn't come see you
until you called first.

1391
01:58:36,442 --> 01:58:37,500
But today..

1392
01:58:51,056 --> 01:58:56,221
I got a job, Pa..
As an assistant photographer for a magazine.

1393
01:58:59,732 --> 01:59:01,222
And I want to do this job!

1394
01:59:02,668 --> 01:59:06,661
I've been working really hard this past month
and I'm actually happy!

1395
01:59:08,674 --> 01:59:12,075
I know I never mentioned photography
as a career..

1396
01:59:12,611 --> 01:59:14,078
And that we have a family business
to take care of..

1397
01:59:15,814 --> 01:59:18,214
but I feel like you'll understand.

1398
01:59:20,352 --> 01:59:22,513
Because photography is something
I got from you.

1399
01:59:27,626 --> 01:59:29,719
I'd forgotten that photography
was your passion too.

1400
01:59:31,096 --> 01:59:38,093
You used to take so many pictures..
why did you stop?

1401
01:59:45,110 --> 01:59:46,168
You grew up, son.

1402
01:59:48,380 --> 01:59:51,110
You didn't have time
for my photographs anymore.

1403
01:59:53,118 --> 01:59:55,643
And photography had meant
nothing more to me..

1404
01:59:55,721 --> 01:59:57,655
..than taking pictures of you.

1405
02:00:14,807 --> 02:00:18,675
My first paycheque, Pa. For you.

1406
02:00:29,421 --> 02:00:31,150
Promise me.. that from now on you..

1407
02:00:31,223 --> 02:00:34,351
..will put your heart into everything you do.

1408
02:00:39,832 --> 02:00:40,890
I'm sorry, Pa.

1409
02:00:44,169 --> 02:00:45,227
I love you.

1410
02:01:28,213 --> 02:01:30,579
What's going on, Sid?
Why did you ask me to rush home?

1411
02:01:36,288 --> 02:01:40,622
Thank God you're home!
You won't believe what happened today.

1412
02:01:41,493 --> 02:01:42,551
What?

1413
02:01:42,961 --> 02:01:44,223
I went to see Dad today.

1414
02:01:45,297 --> 02:01:46,355
Everything is fine now.

1415
02:01:48,500 --> 02:01:49,831
He asked me to come back home.

1416
02:01:51,303 --> 02:01:54,238
I'm going home, Aisha!
Finally back to my own house

1417
02:01:59,244 --> 02:02:01,576
Aish.. say something.

1418
02:02:03,582 --> 02:02:07,712
That's great, Sid.. that's really great..

1419
02:02:11,323 --> 02:02:12,381
When are you leaving?

1420
02:02:13,659 --> 02:02:16,253
Now. Dad's on his way to pick me up.

1421
02:02:19,598 --> 02:02:20,792
You're leaving so soon..?

1422
02:02:22,534 --> 02:02:27,801
Yep. Now this garbage dump
will look like a house again.

1423
02:02:36,014 --> 02:02:40,474
Aisha.. you let me stay here for so long..

1424
02:02:42,020 --> 02:02:43,351
Thank you so much for everything.

1425
02:02:46,959 --> 02:02:48,483
This is for you.

1426
02:02:53,632 --> 02:02:54,690
I don't want it.

1427
02:02:57,369 --> 02:03:01,965
Aisha, I know it's not much,
but I made it especially for you.

1428
02:03:02,040 --> 02:03:04,440
I don't want your stupid gift, Ok?

1429
02:03:05,644 --> 02:03:07,305
What are you getting so upset for?

1430
02:03:07,980 --> 02:03:10,312
You're so right.
Why am I getting upset?

1431
02:03:10,916 --> 02:03:12,577
After all, I knew this would happen.

1432
02:03:12,851 --> 02:03:14,648
You fought with your parents,
so you moved in.

1433
02:03:14,720 --> 02:03:16,381
Now that you've made up with them,
you're moving out!

1434
02:03:16,722 --> 02:03:19,384
So? I'm moving back to my house.

1435
02:03:19,858 --> 02:03:21,325
I can't stay here forever, can l?

1436
02:03:21,393 --> 02:03:22,587
Why can't you?

1437
02:03:23,595 --> 02:03:24,721
Aisha.. I don't understand..

1438
02:03:24,796 --> 02:03:27,390
Of course you don't!
You never understand anything!

1439
02:03:27,866 --> 02:03:30,926
You didn't even talk to me before taking
such a big decision!

1440
02:03:32,070 --> 02:03:34,004
Didn't even stop to think about
how I might feel!

1441
02:03:35,607 --> 02:03:38,337
How can you be
so thoughtless and immature?!

1442
02:03:38,810 --> 02:03:41,404
I should've known.
You're a kid and always will be a kid!

1443
02:03:41,480 --> 02:03:45,610
Damn you Aisha!
Why do you always do this?

1444
02:03:47,486 --> 02:03:49,351
Nothing I do is ever good enough for you!

1445
02:03:50,422 --> 02:03:52,014
Yes, I'm a kid and always will be a kid!

1446
02:03:52,824 --> 02:03:57,352
God, l' m tired of this..
tired of you calling me immature..

1447
02:03:57,429 --> 02:03:59,021
Tired of proving myself to you!

1448
02:04:00,966 --> 02:04:04,629
All these days, I've been trying
to change your opinion of me..

1449
02:04:04,703 --> 02:04:08,833
..hoping that you'll see that
I'm not a kid anymore, but it's useless!

1450
02:04:09,441 --> 02:04:10,567
You just don't see it!

1451
02:04:11,443 --> 02:04:13,502
I'm sick ofyou Aisha!
I'm just so sick of you!

1452
02:04:33,465 --> 02:04:34,523
Aish..

1453
02:04:37,469 --> 02:04:42,406
You're right Sid.
I'm the one who doesn't see it.

1454
02:04:47,546 --> 02:04:51,607
Go home. All the best.

1455
02:05:04,696 --> 02:05:07,893
"Like the string instrument plays. "

1456
02:05:08,433 --> 02:05:11,493
"Like the string instrument plays. "

1457
02:05:12,170 --> 02:05:15,435
"Like the string instrument plays. "

02:05:15,841 --> 02:05:18,833

02:05:29,921 --> 02:05:33,584
"Like the string instrument plays. "

1463
02:05:35,660 --> 02:05:41,530
"Your string instrument is of no use. "

1464
02:06:07,492 --> 02:06:13,021
"The bird is angry..

02:06:13,098 --> 02:06:19,094
..it has Ieft its nest. "

1466
02:06:19,237 --> 02:06:24,504
..it has Ieft its nest. "

02:06:24,576 --> 02:06:29,775

"Tears roll down my cheek. "

1470
02:06:39,791 --> 02:06:45,923
"When I close my eyes,
tears roll down my cheek. "

1471
02:06:46,598 --> 02:06:51,934
"It makes me restless.
Why does it sing sad song?"

1472
02:07:00,946 --> 02:07:04,677
Hello Ma.. It's me, Aisha.

1473
02:07:08,286 --> 02:07:13,223
I'm fine, I'm fine.
I was just missing you guys..

1474
02:07:14,626 --> 02:07:15,684
Where's Dad?

1475
02:07:16,628 --> 02:07:19,688
"A stale night..

1476
02:07:19,764 --> 02:07:22,028
..is close to my pillow. "

1477
02:07:22,634 --> 02:07:27,833
"The morning returned
seeing the close doors. "

1478
02:07:28,240 --> 02:07:34,179
"The fire has extinguished
and the walls are cold. "

1479
02:07:34,246 --> 02:07:39,047
"Voice of the heart is echoing. "

1480
02:07:39,117 --> 02:07:44,111
"Voice of the.. "

1481
02:07:44,189 --> 02:07:48,649
"..heart is echoing. "

1482
02:07:48,727 --> 02:07:50,661
"..heart is echoing. "

1483
02:07:50,729 --> 02:07:56,861
"When I close my eyes,
tears roll down my cheek. "

1484
02:07:56,935 --> 02:07:59,597
"Tears roll down my cheek. "

1485
02:07:59,671 --> 02:08:05,667
"When I close my eyes,
tears roll down my cheek. "

1486
02:08:06,011 --> 02:08:11,677
"It makes me restless.
Why does it sing sad song?"

1487
02:08:11,750 --> 02:08:14,685
"Your string instrument is of no use. "

1488
02:08:14,753 --> 02:08:17,278
"Your string instrument is of no use. "

1489
02:08:17,355 --> 02:08:20,756
"Your string instrument is of no use. "

1490
02:08:20,825 --> 02:08:23,020
"Your string instrument is of no use. "

1491
02:08:23,628 --> 02:08:26,620
"Your string instrument is of no use. "

1492
02:08:26,698 --> 02:08:29,166
"Your string instrument is of no use. "

1493
02:08:29,701 --> 02:08:32,636
"Your string instrument is of no use. "

1494
02:08:32,704 --> 02:08:37,698
Bhaiyya! Wake up Bhaiyya!

1495
02:08:49,254 --> 02:08:53,122
Bhaiyya? Are you Ok?

1496
02:08:54,392 --> 02:08:55,791
Aren't you happy to be back home?

1497
02:08:59,798 --> 02:09:04,929
I'm fine, Chhotu. Now go, don't bug me.

1498
02:09:05,804 --> 02:09:09,001
Make sure you eat your breakfast
before it gets cold.

1499
02:09:09,074 --> 02:09:11,736
And your magazine came this morning..

1500
02:10:45,837 --> 02:10:51,036
"The feeling came from the melting drops.. "

1501
02:10:51,509 --> 02:10:56,845
"The moment has come close to my heart. "

1502
02:10:57,382 --> 02:11:02,251
"It touched the heart, but I couldn't know. "

1503
02:11:02,921 --> 02:11:07,984
"Now when I Iooked; I Iiked the moment. "

1504
02:11:08,059 --> 02:11:11,995
"I can't do this. "

1505
02:11:12,063 --> 02:11:18,935
"I'II send the message through the wind. "

1506
02:11:19,003 --> 02:11:23,997
"Or should I come to you on the wind? "

1507
02:11:24,342 --> 02:11:29,803
"I Iove you. "

1508
02:11:30,348 --> 02:11:36,810
"Where do I get the words from?"

1509
02:11:36,888 --> 02:11:39,880
"Life is coming. "

1510
02:11:42,160 --> 02:11:45,027
"Life is coming your way. "

1511
02:11:45,096 --> 02:11:47,894
'New Girl in the City' - by Aisha Bannerjee.

1512
02:11:47,966 --> 02:11:53,370
Like many others before me,
I came to Mumbai with many dreams.

1513
02:11:54,239 --> 02:11:57,106
The biggest one was to become a writer.

1514
02:11:58,309 --> 02:12:02,040
With this column, Mumbai has made
that one dream come true.

1515
02:12:03,848 --> 02:12:06,908
But, even after a lot of struggle,
I couldn't do it justice.

1516
02:12:07,585 --> 02:12:10,110
Everything I wrote seemed lacking.

1517
02:12:10,989 --> 02:12:14,117
What could I say about this city
that hadn't been said before?

1518
02:12:15,393 --> 02:12:20,387
So I tore up my approved article
and began writing again.

1519
02:12:25,937 --> 02:12:26,995
In just two months..

1520
02:12:27,272 --> 02:12:31,470
I've begun to feel a strange love for Mumbai,
as if its my own..

1521
02:12:31,943 --> 02:12:33,001
What lay at the core of this love?

1522
02:12:33,878 --> 02:12:34,936
My exciting new job?

1523
02:12:35,480 --> 02:12:38,278
My little flat? Or my independence?

1524
02:12:39,083 --> 02:12:41,142
What has this city given me
that makes me love her so?

1525
02:12:42,353 --> 02:12:44,947
Actually the answer had been
in front of me all along..

1526
02:12:45,957 --> 02:12:47,219
I just didn't see it.

1527
02:12:49,294 --> 02:12:52,024
I met someone the first night
that I was in Bombay.

1528
02:12:52,230 --> 02:12:57,896
A boy, a friend, a room mate,
a companion - just someone.

1529
02:12:58,102 --> 02:13:01,902
He didn't really have
any ambitions or goals..

1530
02:13:01,973 --> 02:13:04,965
.. but he sure knew how to enjoy his life.

1531
02:13:06,311 --> 02:13:07,369
When I look back..

1532
02:13:07,512 --> 02:13:09,912
I wonder if the joy
of making a new home..

1533
02:13:09,981 --> 02:13:11,972
.. would have been the same
without his help..

1534
02:13:12,383 --> 02:13:17,446
I look back upon a lonely night made
less lonely by a shared cup of tea.

1535
02:13:18,323 --> 02:13:21,053
When I had first come here,
I had my goals straight.

1536
02:13:21,326 --> 02:13:25,319
But now I know, that the joy of achieving
these goals is meaningful

1537
02:13:25,997 --> 02:13:27,589
only when shared with someone else.

1538
02:13:28,666 --> 02:13:32,067
Only now do I see that my strange love.

1539
02:13:32,537 --> 02:13:36,337
for this city is actually one with my love
for this person!

1540
02:13:37,275 --> 02:13:38,936
He's the one who taught me
the essence of love.

1541
02:13:40,411 --> 02:13:43,141
Mumbai is as tough as it is beautiful.

1542
02:13:43,681 --> 02:13:45,945
Sometimes, while running after our goals

1543
02:13:46,017 --> 02:13:47,951
we lose sight of the things
that really matter.

1544
02:13:48,286 --> 02:13:52,484
So close your eyes for a second,

1545
02:13:52,557 --> 02:13:56,015
Look for your special someone,
and see the city through their eyes.

1546
