00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:43,519
<i>He's rhinitis country, and
I'm gonna gut him like a fish.</i>

165
00:13:43,621 --> 00:13:45,590
- They sound worse in English.
- Yeah.

166
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:48,318
We got this guy yesterday.
Did you translate this?

167
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:54,056
No. But whoever did's
not a native speaker.

168
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,826
How do you know that?

169
00:13:55,934 --> 00:14:00,201
Well, he translated here...

170
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:03,503
And that literally means "to put
pressure on him, he bit the guy."

171
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:06,772
<i>As if he was being tortured. But
that's not what it means here.</i>

172
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,609
It's slang. It means
he bribed him.

173
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:11,615
He didn't bite him.

174
00:14:11,716 --> 00:14:14,048
Good.

175
00:14:16,621 --> 00:14:18,283
We need to talk.

176
00:14:23,528 --> 00:14:27,625
I think you have a little spinach
or something in your teeth.

177
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,163
I want you to route all
calls through to my cell.

178
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:36,139
You picked a hell of a day
to start your field work.

179
00:14:36,241 --> 00:14:39,802
- Button up your jacket.
- Why? What going on?

180
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:43,575
<i>Dispatch, this is Charlie
9. Units on scene.</i>

181
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,932
<i>Here comes the secret service.</i>

182
00:14:45,943 --> 00:14:49,620
<i>I really don't need them
breathing down my neck.</i>

183
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:51,712
What do they know about
investigating murder?

184
00:14:54,192 --> 00:14:56,388
She can breathe down my neck.

185
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,462
But not him.

186
00:14:58,563 --> 00:15:01,259
Agents breckinridge,
marin. Secret service.

187
00:15:01,366 --> 00:15:03,562
- You guys bring lunch?
- Not today.

188
00:15:31,429 --> 00:15:34,695
<i>The way I see it, he
hands over the wallet.</i>

189
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,428
As the guy reaches for it,
merriweather goes for his gun.

190
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:40,869
<i>Bad guy shoots him first.</i>

191
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:45,275
- You think this is a street crime?
- In my gut, yeah.

192
00:15:45,376 --> 00:15:47,971
You know my problem
with gut feelings?

193
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,673
Once you have them, the
only evidence you see...

194
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,841
Is the evidence that
reinforces your gut feeling.

195
00:15:52,951 --> 00:15:53,772
<i>Human nature.</i>

196
00:15:53,783 --> 00:15:56,115
<i>There's no money
left in his wallet...</i>

197
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:59,053
And there's been a series of
robberies here the last two months.

198
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:01,682
<i>You have some reason to
think it wasn't a robbery?</i>

199
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:05,490
Well, agent merriweather spent the last 25
years honing his ability to sense danger...

200
00:16:05,596 --> 00:16:07,496
To notice anything outside
of the ordinary...

201
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:09,677
So for some average street
criminal to get the

202
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,557
drop on him... yeah,
it raises questions.

203
00:16:11,669 --> 00:16:15,868
Not to mention that he's been
shot here twice with a. 45.

204
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,634
I'm gonna take a guess here,
but from your initial

205
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:21,003
canvassing, I bet you
no one heard anything.

206
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:24,240
Any homicide cop will tell you that
sort of thing happens all the time.

207
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,080
Yeah, I bet they
would, detective.

208
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:46,567
Rosario.

209
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,832
Anyone want anything
to eat or drink?

210
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:51,165
Uh, no, thanks, ma'am.
I think we're fine.

211
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,172
Well, I'm hungry.

212
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:54,352
Tom, sweep downstairs
and go for dinner. I'll

213
00:16:54,365 --> 00:16:56,543
sweep upstairs, sit post
till the shift change.

214
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:58,946
You sure? You've been
on as long as me.

215
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:01,678
You gonna make
me change my mind?

216
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:06,086
<i>Detective, take a look at the bullet mark
on the doorjamb. The slug didn't penetrate.</i>

217
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:09,751
<i>It's cedar, which is a soft
wood. It gets brittle with age.</i>

218
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,166
<i>So what are you saying?</i>

219
00:17:11,179 --> 00:17:14,127
<i>Bad guy used a silencer.
That's why nobody heard it.</i>

220
00:17:14,232 --> 00:17:16,530
And that's what slowed down
the velocity of the bullet...

221
00:17:16,634 --> 00:17:18,761
And stopped it from
penetrating the wood...

222
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:24,308
Which it easily would have done had it been
traveling at its normal rate of speed.

223
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,570
The shooter was
standing right here.

224
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:29,613
<i>One other thing, detective.</i>

225
00:17:29,714 --> 00:17:34,584
Excuse me. Agent merriweather's
firearm... the safety's still on.

226
00:17:34,685 --> 00:17:37,552
We assumed he just didn't
have time to flick it off.

227
00:17:37,655 --> 00:17:42,787
Agent marin, why don't you explain to
the detectives why that is unlikely.

228
00:17:42,894 --> 00:17:46,887
If he was a police officer, it would make
sense because your academy trains you...

229
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:50,298
To draw your weapon and flip the
safety in two separate actions...

230
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,461
To avoid accidental shootings.

231
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,164
Our academy trains us to draw
and flip in a single motion.

232
00:17:55,273 --> 00:17:58,072
If he managed to draw his weapon,
his safety should have been off.

233
00:17:58,176 --> 00:18:01,339
<i>A protective agent maybe draws his weapon
once an entire presidential term.</i>

234
00:18:01,446 --> 00:18:04,973
<i>When we draw our weapon,
we intend to use it.</i>

235
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,347
Bottom line... agent
merriweather was assassinated.

236
00:18:07,452 --> 00:18:11,787
I want the murder weapon. I don't
care if you have to drag the potomac.

237
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:16,691
If this man was one of yours, you would
have treated him with a lot more respect.

238
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:21,258
Let's get a gurney up here!

239
00:18:33,211 --> 00:18:35,839
<i>It always amazes me
how thorough you are.</i>

240
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,508
Well, we try to do
the best job we can.

241
00:18:38,616 --> 00:18:40,949
Hopefully you sleep
better at night.

242
00:18:41,052 --> 00:18:42,447
And I definitely do.

243
00:18:42,459 --> 00:18:45,717
Garrison, dipaola. We're
good on the perimeter.

244
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:48,519
<i>- I'm 10-60.
- Uh, Roger, 10-60.</i>

245
00:18:48,626 --> 00:18:53,529
I let dipaola go early,
so, uh, he can...

246
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,599
Get something to eat.

247
00:19:04,108 --> 00:19:07,738
- Hi.
- Hi.

248
00:19:10,214 --> 00:19:12,307
You all right?

249
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:17,354
I missed you. I
missed you so much.

250
00:19:17,455 --> 00:19:20,549
- Just a second.
- Okay.

251
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:09,203
- This is outstanding.
- There you go. And enjoy.

252
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,489
I love you, Sarah.

253
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:28,651
<i>- Garrison, dipaola.
- Where are you?</i>

254
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:31,228
- Garrison, dipaola, where are you?
- Shit.

255
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:36,166
Yeah, I'm on my way.

256
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,636
Hi. So what the hell
is going on, or...

257
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:45,141
Aziz, what are you doing here?

258
00:20:45,243 --> 00:20:47,837
Charlie merriweather
was murdered.

259
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:53,076
He... he was murdered?

260
00:20:53,184 --> 00:20:55,278
P.I.D. Thinks it might
be connected to work.

261
00:20:55,386 --> 00:20:58,220
Director put us on alert.

262
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:00,951
I'm sorry. I know
he was your friend.

263
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,124
Was there any kind of
shift in his behavior?

264
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:08,199
Was he agitated or
worried about anything?

265
00:21:11,369 --> 00:21:14,362
<i>He was a little distant
at breakfast on Sunday.</i>

266
00:21:14,472 --> 00:21:15,602
Did he tell you why?

267
00:21:15,614 --> 00:21:18,465
He just said he had a
couple of tough days at work.

268
00:21:18,576 --> 00:21:23,809
- What'd he say at breakfast?
- Some gossip. Uh, it's kind of personal.

269
00:21:23,914 --> 00:21:26,144
Nancy, I know how difficult
this is for you...

270
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:31,153
But I need a complete picture if I'm
gonna investigate this properly.

271
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:33,190
He told me that he thought
Pete Garrison was

272
00:21:33,201 --> 00:21:35,192
having an affair with
someone's wife at work.

273
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:39,162
- Just gossip. It just...
- Yeah.

274
00:21:39,263 --> 00:21:41,993
Probably not even true.

275
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:46,261
Look, that's all
we need for now.

276
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:55,976
<i>- You got the lead on Charlie's murder?
- Screw you.</i>

277
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,741
- What?
- Screw you.

278
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:03,646
<i>- You still got a problem with me?
- Take your hands off of me.</i>

279
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:07,019
Christ. It doesn't matter
what I say to you.

280
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,593
I don't care if you got
a problem with me...

281
00:22:09,694 --> 00:22:12,686
But you show respect when
you come to this house.

282
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:14,766
Charlie was one of
my best friends.

283
00:22:14,865 --> 00:22:17,596
If you have information that can
help me, that I want to hear.

284
00:22:17,702 --> 00:22:20,262
- Otherwise, stay out of my way.
- Fine. You're a piece of work.

285
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:22,271
You know, Nancy did
say one thing.

286
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:25,570
Charlie was upset about something at work.
You have any idea what that might be?

287
00:22:25,676 --> 00:22:26,588
No.

288
00:22:26,601 --> 00:22:29,374
Then if you figure it out,
you know where to find me.

289
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,382
- Yeah, good. I'll send you a memo.
- Do that.

290
00:22:32,483 --> 00:22:35,112
- Hey. Is everything okay?
- Hey, Jill. Yeah.

291
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,188
- You working with him now?
- Yeah.

292
00:22:37,288 --> 00:22:39,483
Keep your eyes open.
You may learn a lot.

293
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,683
But don't listen to
everything he's got to say.

294
00:22:41,792 --> 00:22:44,057
<i>- Especially about me.
- Okay.</i>

295
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:46,596
Pete.

296
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,097
There some problem
between you two?

297
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,395
- I thought you were friends.
- We were.

298
00:22:51,502 --> 00:22:54,369
- So what happened?
- It's personal.

299
00:22:54,472 --> 00:22:56,531
<i>Let's go.</i>

300
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:59,371
No. He can go to hell. I
don't want to talk to him.

301
00:22:59,383 --> 00:23:00,906
Just tell him it wasn't me.

302
00:23:01,011 --> 00:23:02,980
- It wasn't anybody.
- I'm not saying it was.

303
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,548
- I wasn't having an affair!
- Cindy, I know you weren't.

304
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:08,470
What do you want me to
tell him I haven't already

305
00:23:08,481 --> 00:23:10,916
told him 30 times? This
is why I left him.

306
00:23:11,021 --> 00:23:13,855
He's the most pigheaded
man I've ever met.

307
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,428
You still love him, don't you?

308
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:38,280
<i>- Hey, Pete. Pete.
- Hey, tom.</i>

309
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:40,282
You know a guy named
Walter Xavier?

310
00:23:40,384 --> 00:23:43,444
Yeah, sure. He's a snitch I used to use
when I was working in counterfeiting.

311
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:45,454
Okay. Just fielded a
call from this guy.

312
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:47,615
I told him you weren't running
informants anymore...

313
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:50,661
Offered to transfer the
call to w.F.O., p.I.D.

314
00:23:50,761 --> 00:23:53,873
He said you're the only
person he'd talk to.

315
00:23:53,884 --> 00:23:54,925
Thanks.

316
00:24:01,338 --> 00:24:06,173
<i>There he is! Publishers clearing house,
my man! You got something for me?</i>

317
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,803
Did you fill yours out yet?

318
00:24:08,913 --> 00:24:12,781
<i>Every year my mom bugs me to
fill that thing out. I never do.</i>

319
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:14,817
<i>Long time, no see,
Walter. What's up?</i>

320
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,887
Let's walk.

321
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:22,588
You got some info on that
Charlie merriweather murder?

322
00:24:22,693 --> 00:24:24,703
That agent who was killed
outside his house on Monday?

323
00:24:24,715 --> 00:24:25,390
Yeah.

324
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:28,465
Maybe he stumbled into something
he wasn't supposed to, like I did.

325
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:32,002
- What was that something?
- A plot to kill the president.

326
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:37,839
Walter, you know, it's a little
more difficult than it sounds.

327
00:24:37,942 --> 00:24:40,502
Not if you got somebody inside.

328
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:44,613
You saying there's a mole
in the secret service?

329
00:24:44,715 --> 00:24:46,615
That's right.

330
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:49,046
There's an agent who wants to
help assassinate the president?

331
00:24:49,057 --> 00:24:49,837
That's right.

332
00:24:49,862 --> 00:24:53,518
- Well, what's his name?
- I don't know. I just know he exists.

333
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:56,855
Well, how? Who... who's
giving you the information?

334
00:24:56,961 --> 00:24:59,487
- I want one million dollars.
- What are you smoking, Walter?

335
00:24:59,597 --> 00:25:01,656
- Now be serious.
- I'm dead serious.

336
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:10,237
I tell you this stuff, you roll these
guys up, they gonna know I'm the one.

337
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,781
- They'll hunt me down.
- We'll put you in protective custody.

338
00:25:12,806 --> 00:25:16,546
Yeah, and I'll be dead in a day. Listen,
you got a traitor in your organization.

339
00:25:16,647 --> 00:25:18,528
You get me the money,
and I will disappear.

340
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,776
I gotta be honest with you.

341
00:25:19,884 --> 00:25:23,115
I find it pretty far-fetched we got
agents in on an assassination attempt.

342
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:26,622
Here. Maybe this will
change your mind, okay?

343
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,992
<i>Call signs, code words,
today's encryption keys!</i>

344
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:41,003
Yeah, whoever this traitor is...

345
00:25:41,105 --> 00:25:44,007
They're either on the president's
detail or in a key liaison position.

346
00:25:44,108 --> 00:25:46,873
Listen, I want a list of everyone
who's got "q" clearance.

347
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:48,945
And where's the
president right now?

348
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,378
Press conference at his
house. Twenty minutes.

349
00:25:51,482 --> 00:25:56,113
<i>This morning's action demonstrates
our continuing resolve...</i>

350
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,916
To take on the infrastructure
of terrorism...

351
00:25:59,023 --> 00:26:01,048
Wherever we find it
anywhere around the globe.

352
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:03,251
How reliable is this guy Xavier?

353
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:06,454
I've built three counterfeiting
cases using his information.

354
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:10,160
<i>- Against who?
- Mid-level guys, barranquilla cartel.</i>

355
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:14,471
Sir. That's everyone
with "q" clearance.

356
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,733
<i>Those who actually
commit terrorist acts.</i>

357
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,968
<i>Now let me point out,
this is very important...</i>

358
00:26:19,076 --> 00:26:21,671
Polygraph everyone
on that list...

359
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:24,213
And stand up a red team
to find the traitor.

360
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:27,615
Now, I'm going to assume that the hit
on merriweather is connected to this...

361
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:29,982
<i>So let's fold that
investigation in as well.</i>

362
00:26:30,087 --> 00:26:32,325
And we put breckinridge in
charge of the whole thing.

363
00:26:32,336 --> 00:26:33,421
He's the best we've got?

364
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:34,497
Yeah.

365
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:37,461
Pete. He's kind of a protege of yours.
What do you think?

366
00:26:37,561 --> 00:26:40,354
<i>He'll follow the evidence
wherever it leads him.</i>

367
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:41,520
<i>Then he's the guy.</i>

368
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:43,759
You can have anybody you want.

369
00:26:43,867 --> 00:26:47,667
From I.D., from the field.
You get crate blanche.

370
00:26:47,771 --> 00:26:50,104
- Not right now.
- Oh, sorry.

371
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:52,857
I can tell personnel you
need to lose the rookie.

372
00:26:52,869 --> 00:26:54,201
No, I'm gonna keep her.

373
00:26:54,311 --> 00:26:56,973
She hasn't been ruined
by years in the field.

374
00:26:57,082 --> 00:27:02,076
<i>I will blow you up. I come
to bomb this country.</i>

375
00:27:02,186 --> 00:27:05,987
<i>Holy wars.</i>

376
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:08,218
We have intel that
representatives of al-qaeda...

377
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:11,192
Have met on at least two occasions
with the barranquilla leadership.

378
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:15,163
You think it's timed to coincide
with the camp David talks?

379
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:17,826
Probably. The threat alone
interferes with the process.

380
00:27:17,935 --> 00:27:19,563
<i>We pulled 50 agents
in from the field.</i>

381
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:23,003
People who haven't worked at the
white house in at least two cycles.

382
00:27:23,107 --> 00:27:25,133
They'll integrate with
both of your teams.

383
00:27:25,242 --> 00:27:26,988
We're all gonna be looking
over each other's

384
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,482
shoulders till we
find this guy, sir.

385
00:27:39,156 --> 00:27:42,819
Well, do what you have to to protect
me, but I want the threat...

386
00:27:42,926 --> 00:27:47,990
The investigation, I want
everything kept classified.

387
00:27:48,098 --> 00:27:51,660
<i>As far as the public is concerned, I'm
just carrying on my normal business.</i>

388
00:27:51,769 --> 00:27:53,670
- Is that clear?
- Mr. president...

389
00:27:53,771 --> 00:27:55,898
We're going to need to get
everyone involved here.

390
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:58,567
What do you think would happen
to the power of the president...

391
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:01,270
If people thought I wasn't even
safe from my own secret service?

392
00:28:01,378 --> 00:28:04,746
It took over 200 years to create
the symbol of the presidency...

393
00:28:04,848 --> 00:28:07,942
And I'm not gonna undermine
it with something like this.

394
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:10,865
Let's circle the wagons, okay?
You all right?

395
00:28:10,877 --> 00:28:11,818
Fine.

396
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:13,891
Good, let's do that.
How do we proceed?

397
00:28:13,991 --> 00:28:16,653
Bill, you're the guy.

398
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,126
You're the last line of defense.

399
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:23,266
You can protect him better
than any of us can.

400
00:28:23,367 --> 00:28:27,998
Is there anything else that you can
think of that'll help you do that?

401
00:28:28,105 --> 00:28:30,733
Yeah.

402
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:32,934
This.

403
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:39,409
<i>And I promise you, right here and
now, we're gonna win this one.</i>

404
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:42,611
You can bank on it. Thank
you very much. Good night.

405
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,951
Good night. Thank you.

406
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,854
Heads it's sixth street,
tails it's eighth.

407
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:53,297
Bravo cars.

408
00:28:55,666 --> 00:28:57,567
- This way, Mr. president.
- Thank you, bill.

409
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:59,761
Classic is moving to bravo cars.

410
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:02,806
<i>Copy that. Command to Alpha
cars. You are off the hook.</i>

411
00:29:02,906 --> 00:29:04,567
Sir, could you put
down that knife?

412
00:29:04,675 --> 00:29:07,576
It's not what they wanted to hear.
It's what they needed to hear.

413
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,646
Hello, young lady.

414
00:29:15,586 --> 00:29:17,487
Where'd this guy come from?

415
00:29:17,588 --> 00:29:20,955
He's an old c.I. Of
Garrison's. Nine, 10 years.

416
00:29:21,058 --> 00:29:23,027
- Garrison?
- Mm-hmm.

417
00:30:11,308 --> 00:30:13,936
What's wrong?

418
00:30:15,445 --> 00:30:17,310
It's nothing.

419
00:30:17,414 --> 00:30:20,144
- Are you sure?
- Yes. It's okay.

420
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:24,517
- How do I find Xavier?
- Um, I don't know where he lives.

421
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:26,864
<i>He's a fanatic about
not being followed.</i>

422
00:30:26,875 --> 00:30:27,818
<i>You ever tried?</i>

423
00:30:30,961 --> 00:30:32,987
- What?
- Have you ever tried?

424
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:38,329
He wants a million bucks from us,
Dave. I'm sure he'll contact us.

425
00:30:38,435 --> 00:30:40,869
You better be right.

426
00:30:40,971 --> 00:30:44,430
You get in touch with us
as soon as you find him.

427
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:50,572
<i>Could be any one of them. It makes
you a little sick, doesn't it?</i>

428
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:54,237
<i>What percentage of your
people have had a polygraph?</i>

429
00:30:54,249 --> 00:30:55,675
<i>A little over half.</i>

430
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:58,756
"Over half"? The president's
life is at stake.

431
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:03,923
Heads up!

432
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:08,362
I want everybody in this room to have had a
polygraph by 5:00 p. M. This afternoon...

433
00:31:08,465 --> 00:31:11,458
<i>Or don't show up
for work tomorrow.</i>

434
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:16,707
- Were you born in Morocco?
- No.

435
00:31:16,807 --> 00:31:19,742
- Do you live in Bethesda?
- No.

436
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:22,368
<i>- Were you born in Alabama?
- No.</i>

437
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,210
<i>Have you ever had contact
with child pornography?</i>

438
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:27,943
Uh, yes. I was involved with an
investigation with the bureau...

439
00:31:28,051 --> 00:31:33,615
- Just yes or no answers, please.
- Okay, Stan. Yes.

440
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:42,125
Are you up? The
witch hunt is on.

441
00:31:42,232 --> 00:31:44,201
Get your polygraph today.

442
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,472
How did they get these?

443
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:54,510
Night-vision camera on a boat
stabilized by a gyroscope.

444
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:56,579
Pretty sophisticated.

445
00:32:05,522 --> 00:32:07,457
I'm so sorry, Sarah.

446
00:32:07,557 --> 00:32:09,616
I'm sorry.

447
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:13,662
It's gotta be someone
inside the service.

448
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,825
<i>Somebody could have picked it up.
They're good. That's what they do.</i>

449
00:32:16,934 --> 00:32:18,835
Who?

450
00:32:18,936 --> 00:32:21,097
The same agent plotting
to kill John? Who?

451
00:32:21,204 --> 00:32:25,732
141 years there's never been a
traitor in the secret service.

452
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:29,210
Now, all of a sudden, there's
two? I don't buy that.

453
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:31,281
Somehow they're connected.

454
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:34,646
Maybe this is the assassination?

455
00:32:34,751 --> 00:32:37,618
This is a death sentence for John,
a political death sentence.

456
00:32:37,721 --> 00:32:39,815
That's not gonna happen.

457
00:32:39,923 --> 00:32:41,857
Oh, Pete.

458
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,326
<i>Sarah, I promise.</i>

459
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,364
Let's get this goddamn
witch hunt over with.

460
00:32:47,464 --> 00:32:49,329
- Just relax.
- I'm relaxed.

461
00:32:49,433 --> 00:32:52,335
- Were you divorced in 1998?
- No.

462
00:32:52,436 --> 00:32:55,625
Have you received adequate
training for your profession?

463
00:32:55,636 --> 00:32:56,702
No.

464
00:32:56,807 --> 00:32:59,038
But I did stay in a
holiday inn express.

465
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:02,703
<i>Have you ever violated secret service
protocol in the past 30 days?</i>

466
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,077
No.

467
00:33:05,182 --> 00:33:07,173
Have you done anything
in the past 30 days...

468
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:09,252
- To violate secret service protocol?
- No.

469
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:12,323
<i>Are you involved in a plot to kill
the President of the United States?</i>

470
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:15,153
No.

471
00:33:31,808 --> 00:33:34,835
I could use a few of those.

472
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:41,441
- Thanks.
- You look exhausted, bill.

473
00:33:41,551 --> 00:33:44,248
You look worse.

474
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,357
I haven't slept since
we went on alert.

475
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:52,089
Well, I'm back on. It's worse
than going to confession.

476
00:33:54,464 --> 00:33:57,593
<i>Have you done your
polygraph yet?</i>

477
00:33:57,701 --> 00:34:01,378
You know I can't even let
you back on duty unless...

478
00:34:01,391 --> 00:34:02,798
Yeah, I'll go now.

479
00:34:02,906 --> 00:34:06,035
<i>- Is your name Peter Garrison?
- Yes.</i>

480
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:09,083
<i>Are you involved in a
plot to kill the president?</i>

481
00:34:09,096 --> 00:34:10,079
<i>No.</i>

482
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:13,809
<i>- Were you divorced in 1998?
- Yes.</i>

483
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:18,320
<i>Have you violated secret service
protocols in the last 30 days?</i>

484
00:34:20,257 --> 00:34:22,351
No.

485
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,690
Have you done anything
to endanger the life...

486
00:34:24,795 --> 00:34:26,990
Of our president in
the last six months?

487
00:34:29,132 --> 00:34:31,601
- Not that I know of.
- Yes or no answers, please.

488
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:33,670
No. No.

489
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:48,110
Welcome to mayflower hotel.

490
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:55,849
<i>Mayflower hotel, can I help
you? Just a moment, sir.</i>

491
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,393
- Are you Mr. Garrison?
- Yes.

492
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:00,793
You have a phone call.
You can take it here.

493
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:01,978
Thank you.

494
00:35:01,989 --> 00:35:05,266
Walk three blocks east
on Massachusetts Avenue.

495
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:08,027
Take a left on 12th street.
Las palmas coffee shop.

496
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:08,929
All right.

497
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:41,717
<i>Now boarding on track 4,
12: 13 acela express...</i>

498
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:45,626
<i>With stops in Philadelphia,
New York, Boston.</i>

499
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,789
<i>Now boarding, track 4.</i>

500
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,050
F.B.I. Drop it!

501
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:11,643
- Federal agent! Federal agent!
- F.B.I. Freeze! Put it down!

502
00:38:11,755 --> 00:38:14,724
- The gun is going down!
- All right. Back up now. Back up.

503
00:38:14,824 --> 00:38:17,452
<i>Turn around!</i>

504
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:25,862
What the hell were you
doing at las palmas?

505
00:38:25,873 --> 00:38:27,431
Having a goddamn
cup of coffee.

506
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:31,565
What the hell's going on here? Is that
one of your agents I'm following?

507
00:38:31,675 --> 00:38:33,836
Sorry for the crossover.

508
00:38:41,117 --> 00:38:43,677
<i>Pete! I called four times.
Where the hell have you been?</i>

509
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:45,688
We're not out of
here till tomorrow.

510
00:38:45,789 --> 00:38:49,657
The president decided they should arrive
at the summit together. Where were you?

511
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,025
Oh! Excuse me.

512
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:57,532
Oh, here we are. Now, Kate, this is
your weekend to catch the trout.

513
00:38:57,635 --> 00:39:00,831
- I don't like worms.
- No, no. This is fly-fishing.

514
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:50,318
Pete, can I talk
to you a minute?

515
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,411
Yes, sir.

516
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:59,425
We're really, both of us...

517
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:02,795
In uncharted territory
here, aren't we?

518
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:09,632
An assassin inside
the secret service?

519
00:40:09,739 --> 00:40:12,333
Inside my detail?

520
00:40:14,344 --> 00:40:16,505
Now, bill's been briefing
me, of course, but...

521
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:18,514
This guy's your
informant, right?

522
00:40:18,615 --> 00:40:20,914
- Yes, sir.
- I want to get some of this firsthand...

523
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:23,851
So let's make time at camp
David to do that, all right?

524
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:26,320
Yes, sir.

525
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:36,864
Good afternoon, Mr. president.

526
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:38,867
Good afternoon. I'll
see you at dinner.

527
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:41,664
- So, Karen, how do things stand?
- It's time for you to weigh in.

528
00:40:41,771 --> 00:40:43,610
Can I get you in there
now for a few hours?

529
00:40:43,623 --> 00:40:44,239
Absolutely.

530
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,978
Sarah, the wives are
talking about having

531
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:47,798
tea. If you could stop
by, it would be great.

532
00:40:47,911 --> 00:40:50,210
- Sure.
- Tom, we're gonna walk it.

533
00:40:59,889 --> 00:41:03,222
What's going on, Pete? Why don't
they just tell us what they want?

534
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:04,581
It's okay. It's gonna be fine.

535
00:41:04,594 --> 00:41:06,454
Nothing about this
feels okay or fine or...

536
00:41:06,563 --> 00:41:08,463
- It will be.
- Has that guy called you?

537
00:41:08,565 --> 00:41:12,023
- What's his name? What's that guy's name?
- Xavier.

538
00:41:12,135 --> 00:41:15,070
- Has he called you?
- Not yet. No.

539
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:18,802
- Katie, hi.
- Good afternoon, ma'am.

540
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:21,103
- Hi.
- Would you care for tea?

541
00:41:21,211 --> 00:41:24,079
It's such a beautiful day. Why
don't we have tea outside?

542
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:26,268
Well, that's a great idea.
How was your flight?

543
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:26,978
Short.

544
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:39,152
<i>- You guys all decent?
- Afraid so.</i>

545
00:41:39,262 --> 00:41:41,753
Your informant's on the phone.

546
00:41:41,865 --> 00:41:45,199
- Do you got the money?
- I got $100,000 in cash...

547
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:48,829
<i>And a legal document guaranteeing you the
rest once the traitor's apprehended.</i>

548
00:41:48,938 --> 00:41:49,777
Yeah, right.

549
00:41:49,789 --> 00:41:52,340
Walter, we haven't
screwed you in the past.

550
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:55,240
<i>I'm not gonna start now. Otherwise,
all our sources would dry up.</i>

551
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:58,713
<i>Allenwood mall food
court at 11:00 a. M.</i>

552
00:41:58,815 --> 00:42:02,342
And don't try to bring nobody.
I'll walk if I spot 'em.

553
00:42:02,452 --> 00:42:04,250
I cannot get there
in 20 minutes.

554
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,789
<i>- Drive fast.
- Okay, you heard him. Let's go.</i>

555
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:10,414
Breckinridge and marin
are already on the way.

556
00:42:10,425 --> 00:42:11,025
All right.

557
00:42:11,027 --> 00:42:12,811
Get the money bag and
a car ready, please.

558
00:42:12,824 --> 00:42:13,461
Okay. Got it.

559
00:42:13,563 --> 00:42:16,623
He knows we're following him. He went
where he can mix up with a crowd.

560
00:42:16,733 --> 00:42:18,634
There's no way we get
surveillance in there.

561
00:42:18,735 --> 00:42:22,262
Hold it. There's no way I'm gonna
let you go without a backup. No.

562
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:26,139
- Chaminski. Chaminski goes with you.
- Let's go.

563
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:48,655
At your 1:00.

564
00:43:58,001 --> 00:43:59,992
<i>Watch your 3:00.
Watch your 3:00.</i>

565
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:42,271
Check your 9:00.

566
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:47,012
Check your 9:00! Check your
9:00! Check your 9:00!

567
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:02,226
Get down! Secret
service! Get down!

568
00:45:07,637 --> 00:45:10,766
Shots fired. Shots
fired. Agent down.

569
00:45:10,873 --> 00:45:12,967
<i>Copy that. Breckinridge
to command.</i>

570
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:15,306
<i>We need backup at the
allenwood mall. Agent down.</i>

571
00:45:15,411 --> 00:45:19,746
The shooter has blond hair, dark
jacket. He's on the lower level.

572
00:45:19,849 --> 00:45:23,251
<i>Command, copy that. Available units
en route. Es.T.A. 20 minutes.</i>

573
00:45:37,867 --> 00:45:40,302
They're shooting. They're
right behind the doors.

574
00:45:51,815 --> 00:45:53,942
Heads.

575
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:21,978
Pete, we're at the north end
of the mall. Lower level.

576
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:23,842
I'm a hundred yards
south of you.

577
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:26,005
Unholster your weapon.
Keep it down.

578
00:46:26,115 --> 00:46:29,347
<i>- Work your way towards me.
- Copy that. Stagger off 10 feet.</i>

579
00:46:38,561 --> 00:46:40,688
Get out of here!

580
00:46:40,797 --> 00:46:42,766
Take the point.

581
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:54,300
I don't have a visual!

582
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,340
Go!

583
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:07,483
<i>Garrison, Washington command.</i>

584
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:11,755
<i>Additional agents and medical assist are
en route. Break. All units, be advised.</i>

585
00:47:11,862 --> 00:47:13,771
<i>Shots fired, allenwood mall.
One agent is</i>

586
00:47:13,784 --> 00:47:15,889
<i>down. There are multiple
civilian casualties.</i>

587
00:47:15,998 --> 00:47:19,230
<i>Shooter is male, blond
hair, dark jacket.</i>

588
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:39,389
Pete. Pete!

589
00:48:18,695 --> 00:48:20,663
You okay?

590
00:48:20,764 --> 00:48:23,630
Do you have any idea why your
informant wanted to have you killed?

591
00:48:23,733 --> 00:48:25,759
No. I'm wondering
the same thing.

592
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:28,735
You might want to figure
that one out, Pete.

593
00:48:30,373 --> 00:48:32,342
<i>Pete!</i>

594
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:37,438
Presidential helicopter
just went down.

595
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:39,742
<i>This is a news center
special report.</i>

596
00:48:39,849 --> 00:48:45,719
<i>The presidential helicopter,
marine one, has crashed.</i>

597
00:48:45,822 --> 00:48:50,282
<i>Marine one, the presidential
helicopter has gone down.</i>

598
00:48:50,393 --> 00:48:52,434
<i>Whether or not the president
was on board has not...</i>

599
00:48:52,528 --> 00:48:55,498
<i>Marine one, the presidential
helicopter has crashed.</i>

600
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,465
It happened just moments ago about
a half mile south of camp David.

601
00:48:58,568 --> 00:49:00,501
The chopper went down in
some densely wooded...

602
00:49:00,603 --> 00:49:05,701
<i>We're now hearing reports the
president was not on board.</i>

603
00:49:05,809 --> 00:49:08,402
<i>Actually, we can now confirm...</i>

604
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:10,411
<i>That neither the president
or the first lady...</i>

605
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:12,414
<i>Were on board at the
time of the crash.</i>

606
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:15,451
<i>The president and
first lady are safe.</i>

607
00:49:15,552 --> 00:49:18,885
<i>If you're just joining us, these are live
pictures just outside camp David...</i>

608
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:21,514
<i>Where earlier
today, marine one...</i>

609
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,717
<i>Went down shortly after takeoff.</i>

610
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:28,320
<i>Two hikers who witnessed the crash reported
seeing a contrail or fiery tail...</i>

611
00:49:28,431 --> 00:49:30,331
<i>Just before that
helicopter went down.</i>

612
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:33,425
<i>That is leading to the possibility,
unconfirmed by authorities...</i>

613
00:49:33,536 --> 00:49:34,947
<i>Our friend was
insufficiently motivated.</i>

614
00:49:34,958 --> 00:49:36,148
<i>That the chopper
was shot down...</i>

615
00:49:36,172 --> 00:49:38,072
<i>Probably by a
shoulder-fired missile.</i>

616
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:40,074
<i>Now, we want to make
clear, again...</i>

617
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:43,907
<i>That the president and
first lady are safe.</i>

618
00:49:57,594 --> 00:50:00,494
<i>If you are just joining us, these
are live pictures from the scene...</i>

619
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:03,333
<i>Just outside of camp
David, where earlier today</i>

620
00:50:03,346 --> 00:50:05,693
<i>marine one went down
just after takeoff.</i>

621
00:50:05,802 --> 00:50:09,202
<i>Sources say marine and secret service
personnel were on that aircraft...</i>

622
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:12,001
<i>And they were killed
in the crash.</i>

623
00:50:12,108 --> 00:50:15,237
<i>This crash is being investigated by
both the white house and the military.</i>

624
00:50:15,344 --> 00:50:19,213
- You failed.
- I did exactly what I promised.

625
00:50:19,315 --> 00:50:21,375
He wasn't on board.

626
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:25,853
That is the only thing that matters. That
is the only thing I give a shit a...

627
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:30,425
Do you understand?

628
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:34,963
Now, we're gonna meet and
we're gonna discuss this.

629
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:40,329
Deadly against any
low-altitude aircraft...

630
00:50:40,436 --> 00:50:42,802
Including jets, prop
planes and helicopters.

631
00:50:42,905 --> 00:50:45,465
<i>But that comes from witnesses.</i>

632
00:50:45,574 --> 00:50:47,474
<i>Has not been confirmed
by investigators.</i>

633
00:50:47,577 --> 00:50:51,809
<i>Again, these pictures
coming to us about...</i>

634
00:50:58,487 --> 00:51:02,083
Well, it sure doesn't look like
you're here to bury the hatchet.

635
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:05,320
You're being investigated
for treason.

636
00:51:05,429 --> 00:51:08,956
- What are you talk...
- Step back.

637
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:12,398
- Excuse me?
- Step back.

638
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:22,101
- Hey, Jill.
- Pete.

639
00:51:22,211 --> 00:51:24,679
- Matt.
- Pete.

640
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:27,112
Sorry for the intrusion, sir.

641
00:51:28,952 --> 00:51:32,012
If I failed the polygraph,
then why am I still on duty?

642
00:51:32,121 --> 00:51:33,751
Director didn't want
to arrest one of the

643
00:51:33,762 --> 00:51:35,521
guys responsible for
saving Reagan's life...

644
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:38,356
<i>Without a little more evidence.</i>

645
00:51:38,461 --> 00:51:40,929
How long you been working for
the barranquilla cartel?

646
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:45,297
What are you talking about?

647
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:49,463
Hugo, can you come
in here, please?

648
00:51:49,572 --> 00:51:53,599
Pete Garrison, special agent
Ortega with the f.B.I.

649
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:56,304
<i>What were you doing at the
las palmas coffee shop?</i>

650
00:51:56,413 --> 00:51:57,612
I was having a cup of coffee.

651
00:51:57,625 --> 00:51:59,541
Takes you four hours
to have a cup of coffee?

652
00:51:59,648 --> 00:52:03,175
I was killing a few hours at a coffee
shop. Is there a problem with that?

653
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:06,132
Tom dipaola said he called you four times.
You never returned any of his messages.

654
00:52:06,155 --> 00:52:08,521
<i>And that you almost missed the
marine one flight yesterday.</i>

655
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:11,025
They moved the flight up two
hours. I was in the coffee shop.

656
00:52:11,048 --> 00:52:13,054
It was noisy. I couldn't
hear my cell phone.

657
00:52:13,163 --> 00:52:16,690
Now, wh-wh-what is this? What the
hell are you doing following me?

658
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,030
Las palmas coffee shop is a dead
drop for the barranquilla cartel.

659
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:23,128
<i>You screwed up, Pete. You
walked into a stakeout.</i>

660
00:52:23,239 --> 00:52:25,333
I wanna know your number one
go-to guy at the cartel.

661
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:29,708
And I wanna know how you were gonna
help them kill the president.

662
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:34,079
Why would I want to kill the
president? What motive do I have?

663
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:37,983
<i>To be honest with you, I don't care. I
know what the evidence is telling me.</i>

664
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:40,681
I have given my entire life
to the secret service.

665
00:52:40,789 --> 00:52:43,541
I've gotten up at 4:00 a.
M. Every goddamn morning.

666
00:52:43,554 --> 00:52:45,090
Is that what this is about?

667
00:52:45,195 --> 00:52:48,494
You're bitter after all your years of
service that they didn't make you director?

668
00:52:48,597 --> 00:52:51,998
Oh, no. Don't confuse your own
ambition with mine. Okay, Dave?

669
00:52:52,101 --> 00:52:54,501
Come on, Pete. Think about it.
People would understand that.

670
00:52:54,603 --> 00:52:58,096
Jesus Christ, you took a bullet for
the President of the United States.

671
00:52:58,208 --> 00:53:01,233
<i>And in the 25 years since, you haven't
even made shift supervisor...</i>

672
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:04,005
<i>On a presidential detail,
and that I know you wanted.</i>

673
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:06,844
<i>But they don't put guys that bend
the rules, not even a little bit...</i>

674
00:53:06,949 --> 00:53:08,849
In charge of p.P.D., do they?

675
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:11,215
Even if they did take a
bullet for the old man.

676
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:14,016
<i>Is that your professional
or personal opinion?</i>

677
00:53:14,123 --> 00:53:15,818
I think this whole thing
is getting personal.

678
00:53:15,829 --> 00:53:17,003
We got you nailed to the wall.

679
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:19,746
<i>- I didn't have an affair with Cindy.
- Has nothing to do with Cindy.</i>

680
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:22,068
- You can't accept that.
- We are not talking about that!

681
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:25,052
We're talking about it all the time,
even when we're not talking about it!

682
00:53:25,135 --> 00:53:27,728
You can't look at me
without thinking about it!

683
00:53:27,836 --> 00:53:29,713
Jesus Christ, Pete,
you better get a grip.

684
00:53:29,726 --> 00:53:30,396
I got a grip.

685
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:33,907
You think I wrecked your marriage, and
it has completely clouded your judgment.

686
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:36,409
I am following the evidence
and it is overwhelming.

687
00:53:36,512 --> 00:53:39,971
<i>The polygraph. Las palmas coffee shop.
You had unfettered access to marine one.</i>

688
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:42,643
It was hit by a missile
for Christ's sake!

689
00:53:42,751 --> 00:53:44,947
It was hit by a missile
because the flares...

690
00:53:45,054 --> 00:53:47,318
And the four other
countermeasures were disengaged!

691
00:53:47,423 --> 00:53:50,791
There was a hundred other
people who had access to it.

692
00:53:52,528 --> 00:53:55,088
Explain to me about
the bank account.

693
00:53:55,197 --> 00:53:56,114
<i>The what? The...</i>

694
00:53:56,126 --> 00:53:58,394
<i>Your signature's all
over the paperwork.</i>

695
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:00,992
I'm being framed.

696
00:54:01,103 --> 00:54:03,833
- Tell me that's not your signature.
- Think about it!

697
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:05,931
I'm the guy that initiated
this investigation.

698
00:54:06,041 --> 00:54:08,306
Why would I do that if i
wanted to kill the president?

699
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:11,311
You initiated this investigation
for a traitor in our department...

700
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,847
So that when the assassination
actually took place...

701
00:54:13,949 --> 00:54:15,849
<i>You'd be at the bottom
of the list of suspects.</i>

702
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:19,012
<i>I'm being framed! Goddamn
it! Just think about it.</i>

703
00:54:19,121 --> 00:54:22,523
- You take me in, that's the end.
- That guy is out there somewhere!

704
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:25,094
The director just
rolled up outside.

705
00:54:25,195 --> 00:54:28,561
You better start thinking
about cooperating.

706
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:38,166
He's in the car.

707
00:54:54,623 --> 00:54:58,525
- What are you doing, Pete?
- Getting a glass of water.

708
00:55:00,396 --> 00:55:02,728
<i>Director's come all the way
down here to see me, huh?</i>

709
00:55:05,434 --> 00:55:09,735
<i>- That's very impressive.
- It's embarrassing for us, sir.</i>

710
00:55:09,838 --> 00:55:11,898
- Want a beer?
- Look, Pete, we're really...

711
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:18,376
Garrison back door.

712
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:24,215
Oh, shit.

713
00:55:28,757 --> 00:55:32,983
Pete!

714
00:55:34,697 --> 00:55:37,257
Where is he?

715
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:40,568
Sorry.

716
00:55:44,773 --> 00:55:46,958
This is breckinridge.
Garrison has escaped

717
00:55:46,969 --> 00:55:49,369
from the rear of the
residence into the alley.

718
00:55:52,882 --> 00:55:55,873
Cordon off the area
and get back to me.

719
00:55:56,985 --> 00:55:59,351
- He got my radio.
- He got my gun too.

720
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:01,548
He got your gun? And your radio?

721
00:56:01,657 --> 00:56:03,626
<i>What the hell are you
looking at her for?</i>

722
00:56:03,726 --> 00:56:06,695
<i>She's been here two days. How
long have you been here?</i>

723
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:21,400
<i>Where to, mister?</i>

724
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:23,876
Just get me out of here.

725
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:45,626
<i>I know it's hard to believe Pete Garrison
could be involved with something like this.</i>

726
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:49,795
<i>For most of you he's a
friend, to some, a legend.</i>

727
00:56:49,905 --> 00:56:52,306
But the fact is, the evidence
against him is overwhelming.

728
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:55,844
So, how do we find him?
To begin with, know this.

729
00:56:55,945 --> 00:57:00,278
<i>He is smarter and more
experienced than all of you.</i>

730
00:57:00,382 --> 00:57:03,443
<i>You've never trained for this. You
are chasing your worst nightmare.</i>

731
00:57:03,552 --> 00:57:07,114
<i>He knows how you think. He knows what
you know. And he knows how you operate.</i>

732
00:57:07,222 --> 00:57:09,588
And he will use
that against you.

733
00:57:09,692 --> 00:57:13,650
He also knows that it's gonna
be very difficult for you...

734
00:57:13,762 --> 00:57:17,460
To pull the trigger if you
have him in your sights.

735
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:21,594
So I want you to take a
second and visualize that.

736
00:57:21,704 --> 00:57:27,539
<i>Because there is a very good chance that
is exactly how this is going to end.</i>

737
00:57:27,643 --> 00:57:30,976
- Can I have one of these here?
- Yeah, sure. Take it.

738
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:33,673
Yeah?

739
00:57:39,054 --> 00:57:41,784
<i>Fullback, backstop. Do
you have an arrival?</i>

740
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:43,949
<i>Backstop, fullback.
We have arrival.</i>

741
00:57:57,739 --> 00:58:00,402
Backstop, go.

742
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:04,206
Cincinnati wrapping up.
We're Alpha for departure.

743
00:58:16,592 --> 00:58:20,358
I miss the good old days. Do you know
what I mean? I really literally do.

744
00:58:40,115 --> 00:58:42,710
<i>He taps him on the back
and the bear says...</i>

745
00:58:42,818 --> 00:58:45,548
<i>"You didn't come here
to hunt, did ya?"</i>

746
00:58:45,655 --> 00:58:48,748
<i>Get it? The bear.</i>

747
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:52,054
<i>That's not funny, man.</i>

748
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:55,927
<i>That joke ain't funny at all.</i>

749
00:59:11,481 --> 00:59:15,110
<i>- Fullback. We're moving.
- Roger that. We're set up.</i>

750
00:59:28,697 --> 00:59:31,291
See you later, okay?
Be right back.

751
00:59:35,505 --> 00:59:37,405
Thank you.

752
00:59:37,507 --> 00:59:40,967
Welke, dipaola.
Cincinnati's coming to you.

753
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:42,137
Copy that.

754
01:00:04,032 --> 01:00:06,001
Ma'am.

755
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:20,882
What are you doing here? I heard you
were arrested for the helicopter.

756
01:00:20,983 --> 01:00:24,784
Whatever you hear about me in the next few
days, I want you to know I was framed.

757
01:00:24,887 --> 01:00:28,846
- I had to tell you to your face.
- No, you don't. No, you don't.

758
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:32,724
- We're gonna get out of this.
- How?

759
01:00:32,829 --> 01:00:34,797
I haven't figured that out yet.

760
01:00:34,896 --> 01:00:37,179
This is out of control.
You've got to turn yourself in.

761
01:00:37,192 --> 01:00:37,956
No, no.

762
01:00:38,067 --> 01:00:40,780
Yes, you do. I'll go to John.
I'll tell him everything.

763
01:00:40,791 --> 01:00:42,059
I can't let you do that.

764
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:47,768
Pete, they think you're an
assassin. They will kill you.

765
01:00:47,876 --> 01:00:50,471
- You can cover my back.
- How?

766
01:00:50,579 --> 01:00:54,414
The director has got a daily password
for the agents. Find out what it is.

767
01:01:20,643 --> 01:01:22,474
<i>I'm checking through stuff.</i>

768
01:01:22,487 --> 01:01:25,603
<i>Hey, guys. Garrison
just used his cell phone.</i>

769
01:01:25,715 --> 01:01:28,376
<i>He called Chez doucette.</i>

770
01:01:31,653 --> 01:01:34,851
You turned around when
it rang, didn't you?

771
01:01:34,956 --> 01:01:37,016
Yeah, I did.

772
01:01:37,126 --> 01:01:39,889
Ballsy. Very ballsy.

773
01:01:39,996 --> 01:01:42,157
Dipaola said she seemed
completely unfazed.

774
01:01:42,264 --> 01:01:45,563
She came upstairs, waited five
minutes and told him what happened.

775
01:01:45,668 --> 01:01:47,396
Okay.

776
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:52,697
I'm just trying to understand why he
came here and why she reacted that way.

777
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:54,777
<i>- This is your post?
- Yeah, it is.</i>

778
01:01:54,876 --> 01:01:57,072
Naturally, the first lady
doesn't want to believe...

779
01:01:57,179 --> 01:01:59,807
The man protecting her for
the last eight months...

780
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:02,476
Is trying to assassinate
her husband.

781
01:02:02,585 --> 01:02:04,916
That's why Pete came here.

782
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:07,387
He's looking for an ally.

783
01:02:07,489 --> 01:02:10,789
And the first lady is a
very powerful ally to have.

784
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:22,027
Great. The idea is to
secure the entire site.

785
01:02:24,606 --> 01:02:28,235
<i>I want you to get every stolen
car report for the entire area.</i>

786
01:02:28,344 --> 01:02:30,903
Start looking for cars that were
taken within walking distance...

787
01:02:31,012 --> 01:02:33,447
Of the restaurant or any of
the nearby Metro stations.

788
01:02:33,548 --> 01:02:36,746
Then within those parameters, i
want you to isolate accords...

789
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:38,030
Tauruses, camrys
and explorers.

790
01:02:38,043 --> 01:02:39,898
How do you know what kind
of car he's gonna steal?

791
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:42,856
<i>Those are the four most commonly
registered vehicles in the D.C. area.</i>

792
01:02:42,958 --> 01:02:45,222
<i>Pete knows that. He's
gonna want to blend in.</i>

793
01:02:45,327 --> 01:02:48,956
<i>And the first thing he's gonna
want to do is find his informant.</i>

794
01:04:18,217 --> 01:04:21,880
If he tries to breach our computers, we
can find out where he's connecting from.

795
01:04:21,987 --> 01:04:24,387
He knows we would know
that. He wouldn't do it.

796
01:04:24,489 --> 01:04:27,550
- He could connect to someone else.
- How?

797
01:04:27,659 --> 01:04:30,094
Well, he'd need that
person's password.

798
01:04:30,195 --> 01:04:33,358
But as a supervisor, it wouldn't be hard
to get access to others' passwords.

799
01:04:33,465 --> 01:04:35,539
Why would he do that? Why
would he even risk it?

800
01:04:35,552 --> 01:04:36,697
Because he feels trapped.

801
01:04:36,802 --> 01:04:39,465
We have his credit
cards, his cell phone.

802
01:04:39,572 --> 01:04:42,735
<i>He has no other place to hide.</i>

803
01:04:54,487 --> 01:04:57,320
- Can I help you?
- Oh, yes, ma'am.

804
01:04:57,422 --> 01:05:01,826
My name is Lawson Smith. I'm
looking for a Walter Xavier.

805
01:05:01,927 --> 01:05:06,887
Oh, lovely boy, but he
been gone a long time.

806
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,460
Well, this is the address we
have on his sweepstakes form.

807
01:05:10,472 --> 01:05:11,630
Sweepstakes?

808
01:05:11,737 --> 01:05:15,097
Yes, ma'am. I'm with
publishers clearing house.

809
01:05:15,108 --> 01:05:16,231
He win?

810
01:05:16,342 --> 01:05:19,572
- Well, he's a finalist.
- Million dollars.

811
01:05:19,679 --> 01:05:22,146
- And you must be his mother.
- Uh-huh.

812
01:05:22,248 --> 01:05:25,978
Mrs. Miller. I'm remarried.

813
01:05:26,085 --> 01:05:29,110
Would you have another address or
telephone number where I might reach him?

814
01:05:29,222 --> 01:05:33,989
Oh, I'd love to help ya
get in touch with Walter.

815
01:05:34,092 --> 01:05:37,289
Bet he could use
the money, but...

816
01:05:37,396 --> 01:05:40,126
I don't know where he is.

817
01:05:40,233 --> 01:05:43,599
Walter and me haven't
spoke in three years.

818
01:05:43,702 --> 01:05:47,195
Well, if you do talk to him,
tell him we got in touch.

819
01:05:47,306 --> 01:05:49,740
Thank you, ma'am.

820
01:05:51,277 --> 01:05:53,710
Have a good day.

821
01:06:16,168 --> 01:06:18,329
Leave a message.

822
01:06:18,438 --> 01:06:20,338
Walter, it's mom.

823
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:25,536
A guy just come by the house
looking for ya. He's a cop.

824
01:07:35,815 --> 01:07:39,251
On a gut level it
doesn't make sense.

825
01:07:39,351 --> 01:07:41,605
The only thing this guy cares
about in life is his job.

826
01:07:41,617 --> 01:07:42,632
And you know this, why?

827
01:07:42,722 --> 01:07:46,054
Because he went out to the academy a few
times and ran your field exercises?

828
01:07:46,159 --> 01:07:49,150
Listen to me. Pete Garrison
was my best friend...

829
01:07:49,262 --> 01:07:53,358
For 10 years... till
he slept with my wife.

830
01:07:53,465 --> 01:07:58,233
So trust me when I tell you, the only thing
Pete Garrison cares about is Pete Garrison.

831
01:07:58,336 --> 01:08:00,498
- Yeah?
- Somebody who's not tom dipaola...

832
01:08:00,606 --> 01:08:03,005
Just signed in to our databases
using dipaola's password.

833
01:08:03,108 --> 01:08:06,449
Pulled up an address in
andrewsboro, Maryland.

834
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:08,103
I don't believe this.

835
01:08:08,213 --> 01:08:11,182
Get the rest of the
team ready. Let's go.

836
01:08:40,546 --> 01:08:44,778
Walter!

837
01:09:29,795 --> 01:09:32,092
<i>Notify intel we've got a body.</i>

838
01:10:12,805 --> 01:10:15,864
Take the cars around
to the other side!

839
01:10:57,115 --> 01:10:59,083
Pete!

840
01:11:07,059 --> 01:11:09,755
Pete!

841
01:11:15,935 --> 01:11:18,460
Damn it.

842
01:11:50,603 --> 01:11:53,833
This is breckinridge. I'm in a
salvage boat at the end of the dock.

843
01:11:53,939 --> 01:11:57,500
<i>- Set up a perimeter now. Do you copy?
- Copy that.</i>

844
01:12:02,148 --> 01:12:04,547
- Whoa, whoa.
- Secret service.

845
01:12:04,649 --> 01:12:07,448
<i>Get your men to the
back of the boat.</i>

846
01:12:17,595 --> 01:12:20,155
Pete, don't move!

847
01:12:37,550 --> 01:12:39,847
Pete!

848
01:12:44,355 --> 01:12:47,416
<i>- The traitor is still out there, Dave.
- Fine.</i>

849
01:12:47,525 --> 01:12:50,256
If that's true, come on
in. We'll protect you.

850
01:12:50,362 --> 01:12:53,131
The only reason that I'm alive
is they don't know where I am.

851
01:12:53,143 --> 01:12:54,229
Don't make me do this.

852
01:12:54,332 --> 01:12:56,563
<i>- No way!
- Don't make me do this. Pete!</i>

853
01:13:10,716 --> 01:13:13,115
You want to shoot me?

854
01:13:13,219 --> 01:13:15,881
Forget about the kevlar.
Shoot me in my face!

855
01:13:15,988 --> 01:13:19,719
<i>Dave! My buddy!</i>

856
01:13:21,659 --> 01:13:23,787
Come on! Shoot me!

857
01:13:23,895 --> 01:13:26,591
<i>Come on. Shoot me.</i>

858
01:14:00,698 --> 01:14:03,497
- What happened?
- I took him down with a shot to the vest.

859
01:14:03,601 --> 01:14:05,762
I couldn't take the second shot.

860
01:14:11,710 --> 01:14:14,177
<i>What's the least
contained environment...</i>

861
01:14:14,279 --> 01:14:16,550
The president's going to be
in over the next few days?

862
01:14:16,561 --> 01:14:17,443
G8 summit. Toronto.

863
01:14:17,550 --> 01:14:19,814
It's a nightmare for us.

864
01:14:19,918 --> 01:14:22,979
Canadians are allowing the protestors
all the way up to the three perimeter.

865
01:14:23,087 --> 01:14:27,114
The border's not gonna stop him. It's
3,500 miles long and barely patrolled.

866
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:30,626
You really think
it's him, don't you?

867
01:14:54,886 --> 01:14:55,810
Pete, you scared me!

868
01:14:55,823 --> 01:14:57,822
Nancy, I'm sorry. I
can explain everything.

869
01:14:57,922 --> 01:15:00,789
What is going on? What the
hell's been happening?

870
01:15:07,966 --> 01:15:10,744
I think Charlie got wind
of an assassination

871
01:15:10,756 --> 01:15:12,926
plot by one of the
other agents...

872
01:15:13,037 --> 01:15:16,837
So I want to check his computer files, see
if there's any indication of evidence.

873
01:15:16,942 --> 01:15:19,206
Is that why there's a
car watching the house?

874
01:15:24,216 --> 01:15:26,115
<i>The maroon Cadillac.</i>

875
01:15:26,217 --> 01:15:27,164
<i>Who are they?</i>

876
01:15:27,176 --> 01:15:30,051
<i>I think they're the
guys that got Charlie.</i>

877
01:15:30,154 --> 01:15:34,887
Nancy, I'm gonna need the keys to your
car, and I want you to call the police.

878
01:15:34,993 --> 01:15:37,895
<i>Not the secret service. The police.
Tell 'em about the Cadillac.</i>

879
01:15:37,997 --> 01:15:40,966
- Okay.
- Thanks.

880
01:16:40,591 --> 01:16:43,823
<i>I was waiting there maybe three
hours. Nobody showed up.</i>

881
01:16:43,929 --> 01:16:46,158
<i>I didn't want to
stay there all day.</i>

882
01:16:46,265 --> 01:16:49,427
She didn't go nowhere. She
didn't go nowhere, so I left.

883
01:16:52,805 --> 01:16:56,536
What do you want me to do?

884
01:16:56,641 --> 01:17:00,305
Come on. Yes, yes, by herself.

885
01:17:00,412 --> 01:17:02,845
Okay. Yeah, yeah. No, no.

886
01:17:02,948 --> 01:17:04,939
<i>What do you want?</i>

887
01:17:05,050 --> 01:17:10,010
<i>I'm not gonna stay there all night.
She's not gonna be a problem.</i>

888
01:17:12,925 --> 01:17:15,222
<i>No, no. No.</i>

889
01:17:15,327 --> 01:17:17,693
<i>Yes, yes, by herself.</i>

890
01:17:17,796 --> 01:17:19,990
<i>Everything's gonna be okay.</i>

891
01:17:40,853 --> 01:17:43,082
Shooting. Shooting.

892
01:17:52,131 --> 01:17:56,591
- Huh? Huh?
- Shooting!

893
01:18:00,805 --> 01:18:03,104
Your name? Your name!

894
01:18:04,676 --> 01:18:07,872
Who sent you? Who sent you!

895
01:18:32,304 --> 01:18:34,533
Come on. Come on.

896
01:19:34,132 --> 01:19:36,260
- Hi, Jill.
- Pete?

897
01:19:36,368 --> 01:19:38,801
Yeah. Look, I just
got into a shootout.

898
01:19:38,904 --> 01:19:41,372
1265 Leslie, northwest.

899
01:19:41,472 --> 01:19:45,603
He's a foreign operative. He's got a
lot of passports and a lot of cash.

900
01:19:45,711 --> 01:19:50,704
He's got full security access to
the g8 summit in Toronto tomorrow.

901
01:19:50,815 --> 01:19:54,945
<i>Okay, Pete. We're on it. But i
really think you should come in.</i>

902
01:19:55,052 --> 01:19:57,020
Yeah.

903
01:20:02,528 --> 01:20:04,679
Pete, we've been through
the entire place, but

904
01:20:04,690 --> 01:20:06,623
you're gonna have to
be straight with me.

905
01:20:06,731 --> 01:20:09,792
- What are you talking about?
- There's no body.

906
01:20:09,902 --> 01:20:13,064
- There's blood all over the goddamn place.
- There's blood all over...

907
01:20:13,171 --> 01:20:16,073
But there's no body, no
passports, no g8 credentials.

908
01:20:16,175 --> 01:20:19,474
Listen. This is not enough to take
back to overbrook and clear you.

909
01:20:19,578 --> 01:20:22,046
<i>Dave, I don't know
what to tell you.</i>

910
01:20:22,146 --> 01:20:25,912
They're gonna hit him
in Toronto, g8 summit.

911
01:20:26,018 --> 01:20:28,850
Pete. Pete?

912
01:20:31,823 --> 01:20:35,280
Sarah?

913
01:20:35,394 --> 01:20:38,021
Listen, I'm leaving
for Toronto tonight.

914
01:20:38,130 --> 01:20:41,122
Montrose wants to move me up there
early for security purposes.

915
01:20:41,233 --> 01:20:43,224
Oh!

916
01:20:47,038 --> 01:20:49,337
California. My sister.
I'll call her back.

917
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:54,275
Well, this is the speech I'm gonna
give. I'm... I'm reasonably happy.

918
01:20:54,378 --> 01:20:57,576
Maybe you could take a look
at that if you get a chance.

919
01:20:57,682 --> 01:21:01,380
<i>Sure. Then I'll see you tomorrow.
I'll be up after the meeting.</i>

920
01:21:01,485 --> 01:21:03,851
Okay. Thanks.

921
01:21:14,899 --> 01:21:16,800
<i>One new message.</i>

922
01:21:16,902 --> 01:21:20,997
<i>Sarah, I want you to know if i
don't make it, I was doing my job.</i>

923
01:21:21,105 --> 01:21:23,631
I've got to turn this off
before they track me.

924
01:21:23,742 --> 01:21:25,710
I love you.

925
01:21:31,817 --> 01:21:34,377
I want you to get the crime scene
unit out here immediately.

926
01:21:34,485 --> 01:21:37,386
- Rip this place apart.
- Find me something now.

927
01:21:37,488 --> 01:21:39,488
- This is agent breckinridge.
- Agent breckinridge?

928
01:21:39,524 --> 01:21:42,925
Sarah ballentine.

929
01:21:44,529 --> 01:21:46,497
<i>Come in.</i>

930
01:21:48,432 --> 01:21:51,800
<i>Excuse me, ma'am.</i>

931
01:21:51,903 --> 01:21:53,734
Thanks, tom.

932
01:21:55,907 --> 01:21:58,569
- Could I offer you a drink?
- No, thank you, ma'am.

933
01:22:00,979 --> 01:22:03,105
You know, most women
don't like whiskey...

934
01:22:03,215 --> 01:22:06,945
But my mama was from Tennessee.

935
01:22:10,956 --> 01:22:13,515
Pete Garrison and i
are having an affair.

936
01:22:16,795 --> 01:22:20,697
Please have a seat.
And... that's for you.

937
01:22:22,234 --> 01:22:24,997
You know, I don't know all the
evidence you have against him...

938
01:22:25,103 --> 01:22:28,300
But I do know why he failed
the lie detector test.

939
01:22:28,407 --> 01:22:33,537
And I know why he was in that
coffee shop looking for someone.

940
01:23:17,655 --> 01:23:21,649
Hello. U.S. secret
service up for the g8.

941
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:24,319
I got a priority item for the
duty officer over at the lab.

942
01:23:24,429 --> 01:23:27,412
That'll be that direction
on the eighth floor.

943
01:23:27,423 --> 01:23:28,421
Thank you.

944
01:23:28,533 --> 01:23:31,024
Sign the log, please.

945
01:23:37,576 --> 01:23:41,511
I need any prints that you
can find off this cup.

946
01:23:41,613 --> 01:23:44,104
- Okay.
- Thank you very much.

947
01:23:46,350 --> 01:23:48,444
See you in about 12 minutes.

948
01:24:06,637 --> 01:24:09,198
<i>Sweeps two and three
now complete.</i>

949
01:24:48,913 --> 01:24:51,381
I'm gonna be pushing
post in a few minutes...

950
01:24:51,483 --> 01:24:53,576
- But if you want to grab a coffee...
- Marin.

951
01:24:53,685 --> 01:24:57,246
- Hey, Jill. This is Pete.
- A lot of people are looking for you.

952
01:24:57,354 --> 01:24:59,823
I'm sure they are.

953
01:24:59,925 --> 01:25:02,206
- Did you find any prints at the apartment?
- No. Nothing.

954
01:25:02,229 --> 01:25:04,530
I did. You gotta help me out.
If I e-mail the

955
01:25:04,542 --> 01:25:06,756
prints to you, how long
is it gonna take...

956
01:25:06,864 --> 01:25:09,527
To check them against the
f.B.I. And c.I.A. Databases?

957
01:25:09,634 --> 01:25:11,533
Five minutes after
i receive 'em.

958
01:25:11,636 --> 01:25:15,265
I'll call you five minutes
after I send them. Bye.

959
01:25:15,372 --> 01:25:18,103
I've got a print in here. Could
somebody run it for me, please?

960
01:25:18,210 --> 01:25:21,042
- Yeah, I got it.
- Thank you.

961
01:25:46,438 --> 01:25:49,270
In my experience a guilty man doesn't
break into a police station...

962
01:25:49,373 --> 01:25:51,706
And check fingerprints
for a few hours.

963
01:25:51,810 --> 01:25:53,778
What do you think?

964
01:25:55,479 --> 01:25:59,472
My phone was only on
for five minutes.

965
01:25:59,583 --> 01:26:01,518
I was in the neighborhood.

966
01:26:01,619 --> 01:26:05,886
Dave, I can't explain about the bank
account. The other things I can explain.

967
01:26:05,990 --> 01:26:08,323
- I know about the affair.
- It wasn't with Cindy.

968
01:26:08,426 --> 01:26:11,554
Oh, I know. The first lady.

969
01:26:11,662 --> 01:26:14,564
She told me everything. I
know you're being framed.

970
01:26:14,666 --> 01:26:17,498
She showed me the
blackmail photos.

971
01:26:20,671 --> 01:26:23,037
So where does that leave us?

972
01:26:23,140 --> 01:26:27,338
- We need to find this guy.
- Come here.

973
01:26:27,444 --> 01:26:29,572
Yeah.

974
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:33,117
You really are an
idiot, you know that?

975
01:26:33,217 --> 01:26:36,475
You honestly thought that
this wouldn't be uncovered?

976
01:26:36,487 --> 01:26:37,654
Dave, I love her.

977
01:26:37,756 --> 01:26:39,689
Well, that's practical.

978
01:26:39,791 --> 01:26:43,726
<i>The prints belong to gennady
Ivanov, former k.G. B...</i>

979
01:26:43,828 --> 01:26:48,060
Now works for the personal security
service for the president of karjastan.

980
01:26:48,166 --> 01:26:50,600
I'm also showing confirmed
intel that this is the guy...

981
01:26:50,702 --> 01:26:53,033
<i>Responsible for the central
Asian pipeline attacks.</i>

982
01:26:53,137 --> 01:26:55,537
Confirmed intel on
what, agent marin?

983
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:58,939
This is a classified conversation.
We'll be out of here in two minutes.

984
01:26:59,043 --> 01:27:01,706
- Yeah. Whatever.
- Thank you.

985
01:27:01,813 --> 01:27:05,043
These people have the financial and
intelligence resources to pull this off.

986
01:27:05,149 --> 01:27:07,811
All right, let's get going.

987
01:27:10,822 --> 01:27:12,721
We've still gotta find the mole.

988
01:27:12,823 --> 01:27:15,292
We polygraphed every agent
with access to the president.

989
01:27:15,393 --> 01:27:17,520
Yours was the only one
that showed deception.

990
01:27:17,628 --> 01:27:20,756
We need to figure out how the
real traitor passed the test.

991
01:27:20,864 --> 01:27:22,492
Montrose had the list.

992
01:27:25,235 --> 01:27:28,204
You know I never
guaranteed you success.

993
01:27:28,305 --> 01:27:30,206
Security's tighter
than it's ever been.

994
01:27:30,307 --> 01:27:34,108
Routes, modes of transport,
they're all random now.

995
01:27:34,212 --> 01:27:36,510
<i>Yeah, but not random
to you, William.</i>

996
01:27:36,614 --> 01:27:39,368
I mean, if you wanted
him on that helicopter

997
01:27:39,380 --> 01:27:42,144
at camp David, you could
have put him there.

998
01:27:44,021 --> 01:27:47,115
<i>Now, you've been playing
us since the beginning.</i>

999
01:27:47,225 --> 01:27:49,921
<i>All right. Fair enough.</i>

1000
01:27:50,028 --> 01:27:52,860
That's not gonna work anymore.

1001
01:27:52,963 --> 01:27:56,262
- You did make a deal.
- Yeah.

1002
01:27:56,368 --> 01:27:59,337
Twenty years ago with the k.G.B.,
which doesn't even exist anymore.

1003
01:27:59,436 --> 01:28:01,997
Do you want out, William?

1004
01:28:08,212 --> 01:28:11,478
Then give me... the president.

1005
01:28:11,582 --> 01:28:13,676
<i>Just like you agreed.</i>

1006
01:28:13,784 --> 01:28:15,752
No.

1007
01:28:17,889 --> 01:28:19,856
I don't care.

1008
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:22,983
Expose me.

1009
01:28:23,094 --> 01:28:26,927
I don't care if I spend the rest
of my life in prison for treason.

1010
01:28:27,032 --> 01:28:29,626
I don't care if you kill me.

1011
01:28:32,302 --> 01:28:35,863
- Here you go.
- Have a pint.

1012
01:28:39,911 --> 01:28:42,708
Oh. Thank you.

1013
01:28:44,048 --> 01:28:47,484
William...

1014
01:28:47,585 --> 01:28:50,554
If you don't do this,
we're not gonna kill you.

1015
01:28:58,462 --> 01:29:01,226
We are going to kill her.

1016
01:29:05,302 --> 01:29:07,567
And we're gonna kill her.

1017
01:29:09,606 --> 01:29:11,574
And then we're gonna kill her.

1018
01:29:22,386 --> 01:29:25,378
<i>Yes, William, the k.G.B.'S gone.</i>

1019
01:29:25,489 --> 01:29:27,957
<i>But we're still here.</i>

1020
01:29:30,795 --> 01:29:33,354
<i>William, it's all right.</i>

1021
01:29:33,465 --> 01:29:36,024
You do have a way out.

1022
01:29:36,134 --> 01:29:38,101
But only one.

1023
01:29:45,542 --> 01:29:48,569
When he finishes his speech, you
take him on the primary route...

1024
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:51,376
To the "b" motorcade
under the Plaza...

1025
01:29:51,483 --> 01:29:53,814
And you take the radios out.

1026
01:29:55,686 --> 01:29:59,487
Then that's it. And
we'll do the rest.

1027
01:30:02,393 --> 01:30:04,554
Hey, look.

1028
01:30:07,966 --> 01:30:09,990
You can keep those.

1029
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:12,296
I got doubles.

1030
01:30:19,844 --> 01:30:23,837
Jill, it's David. I want you to get
in touch with downing and Medina.

1031
01:30:23,948 --> 01:30:27,747
Confirm for me which one did montrose's
polygraph and get back to me.

1032
01:30:27,851 --> 01:30:31,412
<i>- We're on our way to city hall.
- Got it.</i>

1033
01:30:38,762 --> 01:30:41,425
<i>Command post from
apache follow-up.</i>

1034
01:30:41,533 --> 01:30:44,092
<i>Arrive Martinez location
1740 hours. Copy.</i>

1035
01:30:44,202 --> 01:30:46,931
<i>Summon security, dipaola.
Cincinnati's moving to hold.</i>

1036
01:30:47,037 --> 01:30:49,801
<i>All posts, all posts, be
advised. We have an arrival.</i>

1037
01:30:49,908 --> 01:30:53,810
<i>Only essential traffic
at this time.</i>

1038
01:30:58,649 --> 01:31:01,050
- Everybody ready?
- Yes, sir.

1039
01:31:01,152 --> 01:31:04,121
Let's do this.

1040
01:31:04,221 --> 01:31:06,520
Yeah, tell me what you got.

1041
01:31:06,623 --> 01:31:10,560
- Montrose didn't take the polygraph.
- You're 100% sure?

1042
01:31:10,662 --> 01:31:14,859
Positive. Polygraphers have no record
of montrose even being tested.

1043
01:31:14,966 --> 01:31:17,627
- Neither one of them.
- Montrose didn't take the polygraph.

1044
01:31:26,077 --> 01:31:29,478
Now let there be no mistake. In an
uncertain and an unsafe world...

1045
01:31:29,581 --> 01:31:31,878
America must be strong.

1046
01:31:31,983 --> 01:31:33,882
But previous administrations...

1047
01:31:33,984 --> 01:31:36,453
I also hacked into
merriweather's staff mail.

1048
01:31:36,554 --> 01:31:39,045
He was streaming someone's
offshore phone logs.

1049
01:31:39,157 --> 01:31:41,648
- The logs are montrose's.
- Give me the phone.

1050
01:31:41,759 --> 01:31:43,590
Hi, Jill. It's Pete.

1051
01:31:43,694 --> 01:31:47,221
Get a hold of the first lady and tell
her... only her... that it's montrose.

1052
01:31:47,332 --> 01:31:49,823
Got it.

1053
01:31:49,934 --> 01:31:53,529
Jesus Christ, Pete. The first
lady? What were you thinking?

1054
01:31:53,637 --> 01:31:56,936
I never saw it coming, Dave.

1055
01:32:27,070 --> 01:32:31,872
<i>Be advised, they just allowed
two armed credentialed...</i>

1056
01:32:31,975 --> 01:32:34,376
<i>American agents into the three
perimeter from checkpoint 386.</i>

1057
01:32:34,412 --> 01:32:38,404
<i>Be advised, suspect Garrison
has just been let through...</i>

1058
01:32:38,515 --> 01:32:40,574
I've got a scope on
subject Garrison.

1059
01:32:40,685 --> 01:32:42,585
<i>Ah, Jesus! I got Garrison
through the three.</i>

1060
01:32:42,686 --> 01:32:46,453
<i>This resolution cannot function
alone. It is designed...</i>

1061
01:32:46,556 --> 01:32:49,650
It's Garrison and Breck.

1062
01:32:49,761 --> 01:32:52,490
Holster your weapons.
Holster your weapons!

1063
01:32:52,596 --> 01:32:56,158
<i>I'm agent breckinridge. I issued
the warrant on Pete Garrison.</i>

1064
01:32:56,266 --> 01:32:58,564
Subject in my sight.
Do I take the shot?

1065
01:32:58,670 --> 01:33:02,298
<i>We must ratify the
Kyoto protocol.</i>

1066
01:33:02,407 --> 01:33:05,471
We must embrace the ideal
of an African economic union.

1067
01:33:05,484 --> 01:33:06,810
Need assistance, over.

1068
01:33:09,413 --> 01:33:12,144
- He's a do not admit.
- We have orders.

1069
01:33:12,250 --> 01:33:14,494
- I am countermanding your orders!
- You don't control this site.

1070
01:33:14,519 --> 01:33:16,077
- Montrose does.
- Don't call him!

1071
01:33:16,186 --> 01:33:18,087
- Montrose is the mole!
- Montrose?

1072
01:33:18,189 --> 01:33:20,384
What's the procedure for that?

1073
01:33:22,726 --> 01:33:25,695
<i>No unauthorized personnel
beyond the two perimeter.</i>

1074
01:33:25,796 --> 01:33:27,765
Ma'am.

1075
01:33:30,467 --> 01:33:33,028
Something's wrong. My
radio just went dead.

1076
01:33:33,136 --> 01:33:35,435
I've lost my radio. I
don't have any radio.

1077
01:33:35,539 --> 01:33:38,140
<i>- I'm not hearing any chatter.
- I've got silence on all channels.</i>

1078
01:33:38,163 --> 01:33:40,537
- It's going down!
- Agent Garrison called on my line.

1079
01:33:40,645 --> 01:33:43,944
He wanted me to tell you
that montrose is the mole.

1080
01:33:46,016 --> 01:33:50,613
<i>But I strongly believe that we can
protect our vital interests...</i>

1081
01:33:50,721 --> 01:33:53,315
<i>Without causing resentment.</i>

1082
01:33:53,423 --> 01:33:56,119
Get your hands in the air!

1083
01:33:56,226 --> 01:33:59,787
- Put that down!
- Pete Garrison is not the mole!

1084
01:33:59,896 --> 01:34:02,490
<i>- You are a do not admit!
- But at the same time...</i>

1085
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:06,001
<i>- Mr. president.
- Listen to me!</i>

1086
01:34:06,104 --> 01:34:08,833
<i>Do not let him move
the president!</i>

1087
01:34:08,939 --> 01:34:10,908
This way, Mr. president.

1088
01:34:11,009 --> 01:34:13,849
- Do not let montrose move the president!
- Montrose, he's getting away!

1089
01:34:13,872 --> 01:34:16,739
Crystal. Crystal
is the password.

1090
01:34:19,917 --> 01:34:22,715
We need your help. Tom, get the
first lady to the motorcade.

1091
01:34:27,158 --> 01:34:29,649
It's all right.

1092
01:34:29,761 --> 01:34:30,747
Freeze!

1093
01:34:30,759 --> 01:34:33,753
Password is crystal. Where'd
montrose take the president?

1094
01:34:33,864 --> 01:34:37,061
- Motorcade "b."
- Stay with me, ma'am.

1095
01:34:41,171 --> 01:34:43,230
This way.

1096
01:34:47,545 --> 01:34:51,072
- It's just this way, ma'am.
- Tom, where are we going?

1097
01:34:51,181 --> 01:34:54,173
We're going to
motorcade "c," ma'am.

1098
01:34:58,055 --> 01:35:00,524
That's a hell of a
way to leave the g8.

1099
01:35:00,625 --> 01:35:04,458
<i>What is going on with
these goddamn radios?</i>

1100
01:35:12,537 --> 01:35:15,233
Go in twos.

1101
01:35:19,577 --> 01:35:23,239
What's next, boss?
What's the next move?

1102
01:35:23,346 --> 01:35:26,145
<i>- What's next?
- Bill?</i>

1103
01:35:26,250 --> 01:35:29,310
Hold the corridor.
Push 'em back.

1104
01:35:40,064 --> 01:35:42,395
Crystal!

1105
01:35:45,136 --> 01:35:48,730
<i>Pete, we're cut off
from the "b" motorcade.</i>

1106
01:36:13,631 --> 01:36:16,532
You okay?

1107
01:36:16,634 --> 01:36:18,533
- I think so.
- Turn off your locator.

1108
01:36:18,636 --> 01:36:20,627
What?

1109
01:36:20,738 --> 01:36:24,605
Your locator, turn it off. That's how they
know where we are. They're tracking us.

1110
01:36:24,708 --> 01:36:28,610
How do you... how do you know?

1111
01:36:31,748 --> 01:36:35,377
Oh, no, bill. Oh, god.

1112
01:36:54,404 --> 01:36:57,100
<i>Montrose was...</i>

1113
01:37:22,365 --> 01:37:25,233
<i>Pete. Pete.</i>

1114
01:37:25,336 --> 01:37:28,065
My family. My family. Pete!

1115
01:37:33,077 --> 01:37:35,545
Mr. president, you're
gonna have to trust us.

1116
01:37:35,645 --> 01:37:38,171
<i>We're gonna get you up
top to an evac car.</i>

1117
01:37:57,969 --> 01:38:00,994
Shooter's at 11:00. I'll go
high. You go low. You ready?

1118
01:38:01,104 --> 01:38:02,935
<i>- Yeah.
- Go.</i>

1119
01:38:12,216 --> 01:38:15,275
Get the president upstairs.
We'll cover you from here.

1120
01:38:31,935 --> 01:38:34,927
This way, ma'am. As
quick as you can.

1121
01:38:35,038 --> 01:38:37,564
Yes. Garrison.

1122
01:38:37,675 --> 01:38:40,609
<i>Need a hard car for the
president at southwest two.</i>

1123
01:38:40,711 --> 01:38:42,940
Coming to you, Pete.
Go. Go! Go, go!

1124
01:38:43,046 --> 01:38:45,447
<i>Southwest stairs.
Let's go get 'em!</i>

1125
01:38:45,548 --> 01:38:47,743
All right, we're gonna
get you out of here.

1126
01:39:41,137 --> 01:39:45,164
<i>Give me a perimeter 10
meters, 360 degrees!</i>

1127
01:39:58,988 --> 01:40:01,149
<i>President's hard car!
Let's get him in!</i>

1128
01:40:01,257 --> 01:40:05,057
Pete, I got him. Mr.
president, you're with me.

1129
01:40:23,381 --> 01:40:25,747
<i>The president is away!</i>

1130
01:40:32,555 --> 01:40:34,353
Go, go, go, go!

1131
01:40:38,229 --> 01:40:42,131
Oh, my god! Oh, my god.

1132
01:40:47,570 --> 01:40:50,404
<i>- Secure the first lady!
- We need a hard car, now!</i>

1133
01:41:20,003 --> 01:41:22,063
Carl.

1134
01:41:22,172 --> 01:41:25,141
Listen, Pete, um...

1135
01:41:28,179 --> 01:41:30,078
You take care of yourself.

1136
01:41:32,550 --> 01:41:34,676
I'll save you a tee time.

1137
01:41:37,121 --> 01:41:39,988
Tom, you did a great job. I
was proud to work with you.

1138
01:41:40,090 --> 01:41:41,989
- Thanks.
- Thanks a lot.

1139
01:41:42,091 --> 01:41:45,425
I'll see you guys. Good careers.

1140
01:41:45,529 --> 01:41:48,054
Take care.

1141
01:41:48,164 --> 01:41:50,292
Do well, guys. See you soon.

1142
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:53,336
- Hey, Pete.
- Yeah?

1143
01:41:54,704 --> 01:41:57,195
This could be trouble.

1144
01:41:57,307 --> 01:42:01,971
I'm gonna walk out of the
white house carrying this?

1145
01:42:02,078 --> 01:42:05,047
Thanks, guys.

1146
01:42:06,382 --> 01:42:09,045
<i>- Bye-bye. All the best.
- Hey, Pete!</i>

1147
01:42:09,153 --> 01:42:11,177
You gonna leave without
saying good-bye?

1148
01:42:11,287 --> 01:42:13,721
Well, look who's no
longer a rookie.

1149
01:42:13,823 --> 01:42:15,814
Thanks.

1150
01:42:15,926 --> 01:42:18,019
So, how about a little
retirement dinner tonight?

1151
01:42:18,127 --> 01:42:20,891
I can't. I got a date.

1152
01:42:20,997 --> 01:42:24,331
- Something you want to tell me?
- With my wife.

1153
01:42:24,435 --> 01:42:26,528
That's great.

1154
01:42:26,636 --> 01:42:29,628
- Pete.
- See you around campus, Jill.

1155
01:42:29,739 --> 01:42:32,333
- Thanks for everything.
- Pleasure.

1156
01:42:35,345 --> 01:42:37,974
Yeah, I'm gonna miss it.

1157
01:42:38,082 --> 01:42:40,641
It's gonna miss you too.

1158
01:42:44,020 --> 01:42:46,819
Take care.
