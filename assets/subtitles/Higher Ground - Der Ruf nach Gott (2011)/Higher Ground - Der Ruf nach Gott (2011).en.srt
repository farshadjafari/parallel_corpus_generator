1719
01:41:13,359 --> 01:41:17,112
And the vowels
had to be provided orally

1720
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:19,448
when a word was spoken.

1721
01:41:19,615 --> 01:41:22,784
But the rabbis didn't wanna
use God's name in vain,

1722
01:41:22,952 --> 01:41:25,579
so his name was never spoken.

1723
01:41:27,331 --> 01:41:33,462
So all we're really left with
is just this string of consonants,

1724
01:41:33,629 --> 01:41:35,964
you know, an unspeakable name.

1725
01:41:36,174 --> 01:41:37,758
Bill, just one...

1726
01:41:37,925 --> 01:41:40,761
Just a minute, pastor,
please, just one.

1727
01:41:43,473 --> 01:41:46,391
You know, when I was
a little girl, my pastor told me

1728
01:41:46,559 --> 01:41:50,228
that Jesus was knocking
on the door of my heart.

1729
01:41:50,396 --> 01:41:56,359
And so I listened real hard,
and I thought I heard him.

1730
01:41:56,527 --> 01:42:00,071
I did. I raised my hand
and I told everyone

1731
01:42:00,239 --> 01:42:04,910
that Jesus was standing there,
and he wanted me.

1732
01:42:05,077 --> 01:42:06,953
He wanted me.

1733
01:42:08,289 --> 01:42:12,334
Tap, tap, tap.

1734
01:42:12,502 --> 01:42:14,878
So I invited him in.

1735
01:42:15,213 --> 01:42:20,008
"Welcome," I said,
and I gave my heart outright.

1736
01:42:21,052 --> 01:42:24,805
And I'm standing here today,
and I'm telling you,

1737
01:42:24,972 --> 01:42:26,598
I'm telling you today

1738
01:42:26,766 --> 01:42:30,602
that I'm still waiting for him
to make himself at home.

1739
01:42:30,770 --> 01:42:33,146
You know, I call and I call.

1740
01:42:33,481 --> 01:42:36,900
And there have been times
where I know he answered me.

1741
01:42:37,068 --> 01:42:40,946
I'm... Times where I'm sure of it.

1742
01:42:41,113 --> 01:42:43,406
But other times,

1743
01:42:43,741 --> 01:42:47,786
I've got the porch light on,
and he doesn't come.

1744
01:42:50,164 --> 01:42:53,792
And I feel like I live
in an empty place.

1745
01:42:56,546 --> 01:42:58,046
And I told God, I told him:

1746
01:42:58,214 --> 01:43:02,926
"You know what?
I'm not gonna let go."

1747
01:43:03,094 --> 01:43:07,430
I won't let go until he blesses me.

1748
01:43:07,598 --> 01:43:10,141
But I'm wrestling something
nameless, you know,

1749
01:43:10,309 --> 01:43:11,977
without form and void.

1750
01:43:12,144 --> 01:43:17,232
And I just want it to be solid so bad.

1751
01:43:18,276 --> 01:43:23,905
I need all of this to be real, and I
don't always know how to make it real.

1752
01:43:24,073 --> 01:43:27,826
I don't know how to make
it real, so I am...

1753
01:43:29,495 --> 01:43:31,329
Forgive me.

1754
01:43:32,373 --> 01:43:34,082
Okay?

1755
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:39,462
I admire your faith.
I admire your faith, I really do.

1756
01:43:39,630 --> 01:43:42,632
Thank you.
BILL: Thank you, Corinne.

1757
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:45,635
Let's all turn to number 77
in our hymnals, please.
