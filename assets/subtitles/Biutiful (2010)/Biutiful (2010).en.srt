1
00:01:08,926 --> 00:01:10,885
Is it real?

2
00:01:10,887 --> 00:01:12,365
Yes.

3
00:01:12,367 --> 00:01:15,367
It's said to be from Dad to Mum.

4
00:01:15,766 --> 00:01:18,766
Why have you got it?

5
00:01:19,167 --> 00:01:22,167
Your grandfather gave it to your grandmother
before he left Spain.

6
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:27,367
She was pregnant with me

7
00:01:27,727 --> 00:01:30,045
and never saw him again.

8
00:01:30,046 --> 00:01:32,126
It's lovely.

9
00:01:32,127 --> 00:01:35,127
I never thought I'd touch  a real diamond.

10
00:01:36,646 --> 00:01:39,646
Can I try it on?
Yes.

11
00:01:46,966 --> 00:01:49,966
It's yours now, darling.
Really?

12
00:01:51,326 --> 00:01:54,326
I don't know. Mama always
wore it on this finger.

13
00:01:56,727 --> 00:01:59,727
She said it wasn't real.

14
00:02:03,007 --> 00:02:05,646
Your mama never heard that sound.

15
00:02:05,647 --> 00:02:07,846
What sound?

16
00:03:08,526 --> 00:03:11,526
That scares the owls away.

17
00:03:11,606 --> 00:03:13,725
I saw that movie too.

18
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:16,727
Don't you believe me?

19
00:03:16,806 --> 00:03:19,365
Before, there was nothing here.

20
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:22,286
Just water. Salt water.

21
00:03:22,287 --> 00:03:25,287
Do you know what that sounded  like?

22
00:03:31,326 --> 00:03:34,326
And the wind.

23
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,887
And both together?

24
00:04:31,286 --> 00:04:34,286
What's that over there?

25
00:05:03,326 --> 00:05:05,846
When did the symptoms start?

26
00:05:05,846 --> 00:05:08,846
I don't know.months ago.

27
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:16,167
You can get dressed.

28
00:05:21,086 --> 00:05:24,086
Couldn't you have come sooner?

29
00:05:24,206 --> 00:05:27,206
It didn't hurt like this before.

30
00:05:31,526 --> 00:05:34,526
A nurse is coming to take a blood sample.

31
00:10:59,927 --> 00:11:02,927
Why don't you get started?

32
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,807
What's keeping you here?

33
00:11:23,407 --> 00:11:26,407
Did they tell you about the accident?
Did you hear something?

34
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:30,485
I only heard Luis.

35
00:11:30,486 --> 00:11:33,486
The boy farthest away
Luis.

36
00:11:33,846 --> 00:11:36,846
Luis is OK.
I helped him further.

37
00:11:38,687 --> 00:11:41,687
He told me he was sorry
and asked to be forgiven

38
00:11:43,447 --> 00:11:45,525
for stealing a watch.

39
00:11:45,527 --> 00:11:47,485
Who do you think you are?

40
00:11:47,486 --> 00:11:50,486
You're a disgrace. You know nothing.
You come here and just lie to us.

41
00:11:53,966 --> 00:11:56,326
My son was no thief.
Let me explain

42
00:11:56,326 --> 00:11:59,326
Go! - Luis, tell him to go.
Show a bit of respect for our son.

43
00:12:31,486 --> 00:12:33,765
He asked after you.

44
00:12:33,767 --> 00:12:36,767
Tell him I'll look in in the morning.

45
00:13:01,206 --> 00:13:03,166
Hi.

46
00:13:03,167 --> 00:13:06,167
Dad, I tried to ring you.
I'm a bit late, sorry.

47
00:13:07,966 --> 00:13:10,966
Get your bag. Are you right?

48
00:13:15,407 --> 00:13:18,407
Thanks for the help, Lili.
Five o'clock tomorrow, OK?

49
00:13:19,846 --> 00:13:22,765
Say 'bye to Lili.

50
00:13:22,767 --> 00:13:25,767
And Li.
Bye!

51
00:13:27,246 --> 00:13:30,246
Fish is yucky.
We all eat the same.

52
00:13:32,206 --> 00:13:35,206
What do you want then?

53
00:13:36,287 --> 00:13:39,287
A hamburger and chips

54
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:43,926
and a chocolate milkshake.

55
00:13:43,927 --> 00:13:46,885
Perfect.

56
00:13:46,886 --> 00:13:49,206
And the lady?

57
00:13:49,206 --> 00:13:51,326
Fried egg with sausage

58
00:13:51,326 --> 00:13:54,326
and a potato omelette
with cream and cinnamon.

59
00:14:05,006 --> 00:14:08,006
A hamburger.

60
00:14:09,326 --> 00:14:12,285
And look at all the chips.

61
00:14:12,287 --> 00:14:15,287
Chips here and chips there.

62
00:14:18,206 --> 00:14:21,206
And a big chocolate milkshake.

63
00:14:22,366 --> 00:14:24,645
What will the young lady have?

64
00:14:24,647 --> 00:14:27,647
Fried eggs.
Fried eggs

65
00:14:27,807 --> 00:14:30,807
With sausage.
Sausage

66
00:14:31,326 --> 00:14:34,326
And a potato omelette.

67
00:14:34,527 --> 00:14:37,527
Potato omelette
with cream and cinnamon.

68
00:14:43,647 --> 00:14:46,647
Everything as requested.

69
00:14:49,407 --> 00:14:52,407
What did you get for lunch?
Rice with chicken.

70
00:14:52,486 --> 00:14:54,286
Daddy, did you know-

71
00:14:54,287 --> 00:14:57,287
that if a spacesuit got a hole in it, it'd explode?

72
00:14:57,846 --> 00:15:00,846
Tomorow I'll ask Lili to give you something else.

73
00:15:01,687 --> 00:15:04,687
It isn't Lili who does the food.
So I'll tell Jung.

74
00:15:05,047 --> 00:15:08,047
It's because of the gravity.

75
00:15:10,807 --> 00:15:13,807
Stop kicking the table, Mateo.

76
00:15:20,366 --> 00:15:23,366
Don't shove so much food into your mouth.

77
00:15:23,726 --> 00:15:26,726
I've told you a thousand times.
A thousand times.

78
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:33,567
Don't be disgusting.
Put it back in your mouth.

79
00:15:36,246 --> 00:15:39,246
Food in your mouth, Mateo.
Once more!

80
00:15:40,567 --> 00:15:43,567
Now!

81
00:15:53,407 --> 00:15:56,407
Do you want any more milk?
No.

82
00:16:00,047 --> 00:16:02,686
Stop.

83
00:16:02,687 --> 00:16:05,687
Leave the table
and go to your room.

84
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:23,167
Your supposed to go to your room,
not wash your plate.

85
00:17:05,366 --> 00:17:08,046
What is it?

86
00:17:08,047 --> 00:17:11,047
I've peed in my pants.

87
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:14,166
I'll wash them in the morning, Daddy.

88
00:18:29,926 --> 00:18:32,926
Yes?

89
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:36,726
Wait a sec.

90
00:18:36,727 --> 00:18:39,086
Can you turn that down?

91
00:18:39,086 --> 00:18:42,086
Turn down the music and stop singing.

92
00:18:47,086 --> 00:18:50,086
Yes, I'm here.
Sorry about that.

93
00:18:50,727 --> 00:18:53,727
Yes, the cemetery rang again.

94
00:18:55,047 --> 00:18:58,047
No, they're building a gallery.

95
00:18:58,606 --> 00:19:01,606
Right over Dad.

96
00:19:01,646 --> 00:19:04,526
They've offered good money.

97
00:19:04,527 --> 00:19:07,527
They're offering good money.

98
00:19:07,727 --> 00:19:10,727
They fix up about the coffin and so forth.

99
00:19:14,606 --> 00:19:17,165
It's a good offer.

100
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:20,166
There's nothing you can do
to stop it.

101
00:19:22,807 --> 00:19:25,807
We should have him cremated.

102
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,605
OK, we'll do it then.

103
00:19:30,606 --> 00:19:33,606
Yes, OK, I'll call you.

104
00:19:34,126 --> 00:19:35,925
OK, next week.

105
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:37,645
Look after yourself.

106
00:19:37,646 --> 00:19:40,646
Talk to you later.

107
00:19:42,527 --> 00:19:44,925
Who's being cremated?
Nobody.

108
00:19:44,926 --> 00:19:47,926
Don't lie.

109
00:19:52,126 --> 00:19:55,126
I'll give you a Thai massage.

110
00:19:55,807 --> 00:19:58,807
Who?

111
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:04,326
If you don't tell me
It's my dad!

112
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:08,247
We're cremating him.

113
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:13,166
Which of you is most like your dad?
I don't know.

114
00:20:13,527 --> 00:20:16,527
I don't remember how he looked.

115
00:20:23,326 --> 00:20:25,965
Give me a kiss.

116
00:20:25,967 --> 00:20:28,967
I'm going.

117
00:20:29,007 --> 00:20:32,007
I gotta go.

118
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:35,807
Stop it.
What the fuck are you doing?

119
00:20:52,406 --> 00:20:55,406
Fucking pig!

120
00:20:57,846 --> 00:21:00,846
She's sick in the head.

121
00:21:34,366 --> 00:21:37,366
Where are the others?
I met Cchinaza on the way here.

122
00:21:38,686 --> 00:21:41,445
Where?
In El Fondo.

123
00:21:41,447 --> 00:21:44,326
I sent that bugger back.

124
00:21:44,326 --> 00:21:47,326
Where Ccheikh and Mamadou?

125
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,965
You gotta keep a check on them,
otherwise we're stuffed.

126
00:21:49,967 --> 00:21:52,967
I've said before.. they can't sell here.
It's off limits.

127
00:21:54,967 --> 00:21:57,967
Understand?
Do you understand what I'm saying?

128
00:21:58,287 --> 00:22:01,286
No one buys bugger all down there.

129
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:04,287
I also heard you've started dealing.

130
00:22:10,527 --> 00:22:13,526
Boys, pack up, they're coming.

131
00:22:13,527 --> 00:22:16,527
Mind the cops.
It's time to blow.

132
00:22:18,366 --> 00:22:21,366
I got something to show you.
Home at my place.

133
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:24,406
Your place? Heavens

134
00:22:33,366 --> 00:22:35,326
It's stuck.

135
00:22:35,326 --> 00:22:38,326
Can't open it.

136
00:22:40,007 --> 00:22:41,726
Thanks, lge.

137
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:44,727
No sense in dropping the price
if nobody wants them.

138
00:22:46,007 --> 00:22:48,806
Are they all the same?

139
00:22:48,807 --> 00:22:51,807
Most of them.

140
00:22:52,447 --> 00:22:55,447
This month's been a disaster.
You gotta talk to the Chinese.

141
00:22:56,846 --> 00:22:59,846
Maybe I can get some umbrellas.

142
00:23:00,807 --> 00:23:03,807
Fuck that.
There's fuck-all rain around here.

143
00:23:03,926 --> 00:23:06,926
Yeah, you're right there.

144
00:23:09,926 --> 00:23:12,926
Can you get the kid to sleep?
You'd think there was no one here.

145
00:23:13,446 --> 00:23:16,446
A bit of quiet.
I've got guests.

146
00:23:19,527 --> 00:23:22,527
Who's done this?
Is it you?

147
00:23:23,646 --> 00:23:26,646
Who did this shit? Is this your handbag?

148
00:23:37,606 --> 00:23:40,606
We're getting nowhere with pirate stuff for cash.
It's now or never.

149
00:23:42,406 --> 00:23:45,406
20 building workers
at 1300 euro each.

150
00:23:46,406 --> 00:23:49,006
That's a lot of money.

151
00:23:49,007 --> 00:23:52,007
I gotta think about that.
We're stuffed with all your ideas.

152
00:23:52,727 --> 00:23:54,685
We're losing the contract with Mendoza.

153
00:23:54,686 --> 00:23:57,686
The workers then?
Will they go on making this shit?

154
00:23:58,767 --> 00:24:01,767
I don't know what you're talking about
but we gotta do something, and quickly.

155
00:24:03,727 --> 00:24:06,727
I don't think I'll go on selling shit.

156
00:24:08,646 --> 00:24:11,646
The idiot must be good at something.
The idiot's done a lot more.

157
00:24:23,967 --> 00:24:26,967
That's for your friend in the police.

158
00:24:28,326 --> 00:24:30,605
Did you talk to Mendoza?

159
00:24:30,606 --> 00:24:33,606
yes. My brother has a contact
in a building site in Badalona.

160
00:24:34,207 --> 00:24:37,207
They need a lot of workers right now.
How much money in it?

161
00:24:40,207 --> 00:24:43,207
How much?

162
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:46,567
That's nothing to laugh about, Hai.
How much is it?

163
00:24:48,326 --> 00:24:51,326
What's up with you?
It's sensitive and I have family.

164
00:24:52,527 --> 00:24:54,885
We aren't home in China.

165
00:26:05,126 --> 00:26:08,126
Otherwise you better fucking-well learn African.

166
00:26:09,446 --> 00:26:12,446
You better talk to your people too
and get them to calm down.

167
00:26:15,926 --> 00:26:18,926
That's what I pay you for.

168
00:26:20,646 --> 00:26:23,646
Listen, Uxbal.
We've known each other quite a while now.

169
00:26:24,846 --> 00:26:27,846
But next time you stuff up, you're finished.

170
00:26:28,487 --> 00:26:31,487
Got it?

171
00:26:31,567 --> 00:26:34,567
Understood?

172
00:26:36,606 --> 00:26:39,606
OK, let them know.

173
00:26:44,287 --> 00:26:47,287
For October and November.

174
00:26:47,567 --> 00:26:50,567
Next time they pay late, I put them inside.

175
00:26:51,326 --> 00:26:54,326
Got it?
Or shall I translate?

176
00:27:50,967 --> 00:27:53,967
Daddy's home.
Mummy picked us up barefoot.

177
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:56,766
I took my shoes off, too.

178
00:27:56,767 --> 00:27:59,486
Well?
Well what?

179
00:27:59,487 --> 00:28:02,487
Why weren't you home?
I can't be two places at once.

180
00:28:03,086 --> 00:28:06,086
Mummy's making spaghetti.

181
00:28:06,207 --> 00:28:08,885
Turn off the TV.

182
00:28:08,886 --> 00:28:11,645
Sit down and eat.

183
00:28:11,646 --> 00:28:14,646
Why is the shower on?

184
00:28:17,326 --> 00:28:20,326
You don't have one ironed shirt.
Good way to iron, eh?

185
00:28:38,527 --> 00:28:40,046
Come and eat.

186
00:28:40,047 --> 00:28:42,086
Lili rang, she was upset.

187
00:28:42,086 --> 00:28:45,046
We agreed you should tell me
if you fetched the children.

188
00:28:45,047 --> 00:28:48,047
Sorry.a customer cancelled.

189
00:28:48,207 --> 00:28:51,207
So call me on my mobile.

190
00:28:58,567 --> 00:29:01,566
Will you have some omelette?
It's with apple slices.

191
00:29:01,567 --> 00:29:04,567
Just like the potato one,
but softer and sweet.

192
00:29:07,007 --> 00:29:10,007
Aren't you eating?
No, I'm not hungry.

193
00:29:11,846 --> 00:29:14,846
Miguel's daughter said they were out in the car yesterday-

194
00:29:15,166 --> 00:29:18,006
when a motorbike overtook them going like a goddamned maniac.

195
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:20,766
So Miguel yelled out:
"Hope you die!"

196
00:29:20,767 --> 00:29:23,445
Five minutes later they saw
the motorbike lying on the road-

197
00:29:23,446 --> 00:29:26,446
-and the rider was a pulp
in a pool of blood.

198
00:29:26,567 --> 00:29:29,567
Miguel was so shocked
that he drove to the hospital.

199
00:29:30,047 --> 00:29:33,047
I don't understand why.
If someone did that to me

200
00:29:33,527 --> 00:29:36,527
Quiet. Marambra, that's enough.

201
00:29:38,646 --> 00:29:41,646
If you could stop talking,
maybe you'd get hungry.

202
00:29:43,366 --> 00:29:45,445
Do me a favour.put that cigarette out.

203
00:29:45,447 --> 00:29:48,447
And take your foot off the table when we're eating.

204
00:29:53,967 --> 00:29:56,967
Do you want to stay and watch a movie after, Mummy?

205
00:30:02,606 --> 00:30:05,606
It's late, sweetie.

206
00:30:06,767 --> 00:30:09,767
If I can't talk, how do I get you
not to include them at funerals?

207
00:30:11,487 --> 00:30:14,125
That's why Mateo's still wetting his bed.

208
00:30:14,126 --> 00:30:15,526
I haven't had them for ages.

209
00:30:15,527 --> 00:30:18,527
That's not what they say.
Just because you have custody

210
00:30:18,767 --> 00:30:21,767
Do you come to hit your kids or question them?

211
00:30:25,727 --> 00:30:28,727
Mamma, the spaghetti tastes nothing.

212
00:30:30,886 --> 00:30:33,886
-You've still nearly eaten it all up.
-Off you go.

213
00:30:34,967 --> 00:30:37,967
Go on.
Let's at least eat in peace.

214
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:43,047
Best I leave.

215
00:30:43,886 --> 00:30:46,886
See you darling.

216
00:30:47,926 --> 00:30:50,926
Enjoy yourself sweetie.

217
00:31:25,207 --> 00:31:28,207
Marambra

218
00:31:29,886 --> 00:31:32,806
Sorry. You did good.

219
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:34,526
Did good?
Yeah.

220
00:31:34,527 --> 00:31:37,527
Fuck what you think of me.
I'm not a dog.

221
00:31:37,767 --> 00:31:40,767
You've turned the kids against me
No, Marambra, you did that yourself.

222
00:31:42,126 --> 00:31:45,086
It's like it pisses you off to see me happy.

223
00:31:45,086 --> 00:31:48,086
Only with you is it hard to be myself
and feel good..

224
00:31:48,126 --> 00:31:51,126
Do you remember where you lived
last time you felt good?

225
00:31:51,967 --> 00:31:54,967
Do you want me to remind you?

226
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:58,447
You don't need to remind me.

227
00:32:00,406 --> 00:32:03,406
Why are you laughing?

228
00:32:06,886 --> 00:32:09,886
I laugh at anything.
And I like to see people smile.

229
00:32:11,287 --> 00:32:14,287
I'm happy if I'm happy and
down if I'm down.

230
00:32:19,287 --> 00:32:22,287
I just wanted

231
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:26,165
I love you.

232
00:32:26,166 --> 00:32:29,166
I said I loved you.

233
00:32:37,886 --> 00:32:40,886
Yes, me too.

234
00:33:05,606 --> 00:33:08,606
You wouldn't have some money on you?

235
00:33:20,527 --> 00:33:23,205
Haven't you got any more?
No.

236
00:33:23,207 --> 00:33:26,207
Now that you're selling the grave.
Who told you that?

237
00:33:32,807 --> 00:33:35,807
Tito.
When did you talk to him?

238
00:33:37,086 --> 00:33:40,086
Please don't start. I gave him a
massage. He had a backache.

239
00:33:48,207 --> 00:33:51,207
It's not a grave, it's a niche.

240
00:34:21,447 --> 00:34:23,246
But

241
00:34:23,246 --> 00:34:26,246
No one told me I was obliged to fast.

242
00:34:29,166 --> 00:34:31,085
And

243
00:34:31,086 --> 00:34:33,485
it might be a technical error.

244
00:34:33,487 --> 00:34:36,487
No, I'll complain.
Fasting is just a formality.

245
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:42,286
How's it coming along?
Excuse me?

246
00:34:43,126 --> 00:34:45,525
How

247
00:34:45,527 --> 00:34:48,365
I've gotta know what happened.

248
00:34:48,367 --> 00:34:51,367
It depends on how your body reacts to chemotherapy.

249
00:34:51,606 --> 00:34:54,606
In your case it's gone a long time-

250
00:34:54,766 --> 00:34:57,766
and it has metatasted from the prostate
to the skeleton and liver.

251
00:35:01,447 --> 00:35:03,005
Which means

252
00:35:03,007 --> 00:35:06,007
But how long?
Roughly how long?

253
00:35:11,327 --> 00:35:14,327
With medical treatment
you can keep your lifestyle-

254
00:35:15,047 --> 00:35:18,047
for a couple of months.

255
00:35:21,726 --> 00:35:24,726
Months?

256
00:36:22,206 --> 00:36:25,206
Daddy, I've learnt to do a trick.

257
00:36:25,646 --> 00:36:28,326
Think of a country that starts with D.

258
00:36:28,327 --> 00:36:30,525
Daddy, look at me.

259
00:36:30,527 --> 00:36:32,485
Ready?
Yes.

260
00:36:32,487 --> 00:36:35,487
Then think of an animal that starts with L.

261
00:36:36,007 --> 00:36:39,007
Hippopotamus doesn't start with L.

262
00:36:39,487 --> 00:36:41,806
Are you ready?
Yep.

263
00:36:41,806 --> 00:36:44,806
You thought of
leeches in Denmark.

264
00:36:49,047 --> 00:36:52,047
How did you know that?

265
00:36:52,407 --> 00:36:55,405
Daddy, how do you spell ""beautiful""?

266
00:36:55,407 --> 00:36:58,407
-Like it sounds.
-With an i?

267
00:37:00,206 --> 00:37:03,206
Biutiful.

268
00:40:34,367 --> 00:40:37,367
No, that's OK, don't be scared.

269
00:40:37,447 --> 00:40:40,447
Just fetch the kids and take them home.

270
00:40:42,527 --> 00:40:45,045
I don't know.

271
00:40:45,047 --> 00:40:48,047
Til i get out.
In a couple of days, probably.

272
00:41:06,847 --> 00:41:09,847
It's getting tough.

273
00:41:11,726 --> 00:41:14,726
We close down the handbags
and copy movies.

274
00:41:16,606 --> 00:41:19,606
You were right.

275
00:41:20,447 --> 00:41:22,925
The building side is lucrative.

276
00:41:22,927 --> 00:41:25,927
The building workers can keep going at Mendoza's.

277
00:41:26,686 --> 00:41:29,686
Pay the ones we agreed on.

278
00:41:32,126 --> 00:41:35,126
You won't regret it
We're helping them.

279
00:41:36,686 --> 00:41:39,686
And it's safer for us.
There's a lot of money to be made.

280
00:41:42,126 --> 00:41:45,126
Uxbal asked me for money
for the stoves in the warehouse.

281
00:41:46,646 --> 00:41:49,646
I don't want anyone to freeze in the cellar.

282
00:41:50,206 --> 00:41:53,206
OK, I'll see what I can do.
Where are you going?

283
00:41:54,407 --> 00:41:57,407
I've got to go home.

284
00:42:23,487 --> 00:42:26,487
Are you going to fight about a nigger?

285
00:42:30,646 --> 00:42:33,646
How much was the bail?

286
00:42:33,847 --> 00:42:36,847
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.

287
00:42:36,967 --> 00:42:39,967
Forget it.
I'll take it from the money they give us for Dad's niche.

288
00:42:43,367 --> 00:42:45,686
Has it been fixed up?

289
00:42:45,686 --> 00:42:48,686
We just gotta fill in some forms from the cemetery
and we get the money.

290
00:42:50,246 --> 00:42:53,246
But first we gotta cremate him.
After that we can do what we want.

291
00:42:53,766 --> 00:42:56,726
We can bury him with Mum's ashes and save money.

292
00:42:56,726 --> 00:42:59,726
Look at these things.

293
00:43:00,487 --> 00:43:03,487
Careful, they're Dad's papers.

294
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:10,126
How's it going with the Chinese on the building site?

295
00:43:12,206 --> 00:43:15,206
Mendoza is totally crapped off.

296
00:43:15,487 --> 00:43:17,766
Most of them know nothing about building.

297
00:43:17,766 --> 00:43:20,766
None of them speak Spanish
and they all look the same.

298
00:43:22,847 --> 00:43:25,166
Have you told Marambra
about the cemetery?

299
00:43:25,166 --> 00:43:27,405
No.

300
00:43:27,407 --> 00:43:30,126
Hmm.

301
00:43:30,126 --> 00:43:33,126
She rang me a while ago.
She rang me looking for you, or something.

302
00:43:34,967 --> 00:43:37,967
But I didn't say anything to her.
I haven't seen her for ages.

303
00:44:19,967 --> 00:44:22,967
Uxbal?

304
00:44:26,487 --> 00:44:29,487
Take this.

305
00:44:29,527 --> 00:44:32,527
That's not necessary.
I gotta know what my son said.

306
00:44:33,527 --> 00:44:36,527
The day before the accident we had a row.

307
00:44:39,726 --> 00:44:42,726
That was the last I.

308
00:44:43,407 --> 00:44:46,407
Your son went off peacefully.
He was scared, so I helped him.

309
00:44:48,887 --> 00:44:51,887
He talked about your watch
and where he'd hidden it.

310
00:44:53,447 --> 00:44:54,885
Where?

311
00:44:54,887 --> 00:44:57,887
Behind a leg of his bed.

312
00:45:00,327 --> 00:45:03,327
Yes.

313
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:12,606
I'm very sorry. Really.

314
00:45:36,766 --> 00:45:39,766
Who is it?
It's me.

315
00:45:44,447 --> 00:45:47,286
I expected you tomorrow
I was in the area and

316
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:49,405
Come in.

317
00:45:49,407 --> 00:45:52,407
Thanks for the help with the kids
I was thinking I could take them now

318
00:45:52,847 --> 00:45:55,166
Quiet.

319
00:45:55,166 --> 00:45:58,166
The kids are asleep.
What did you tell them?

320
00:45:58,686 --> 00:46:01,686
That you were at your brother's.
Something about your work..

321
00:46:07,487 --> 00:46:10,487
I'll pick them up in the morning
before they go to school, OK?

322
00:46:12,206 --> 00:46:14,246
You're welcome to stay.

323
00:46:14,246 --> 00:46:16,965
I can put on coffee or tea.

324
00:46:16,967 --> 00:46:19,565
There's wine, too.

325
00:46:19,567 --> 00:46:22,567
Don't look at me like that.
I haven't started drinking.

326
00:46:25,166 --> 00:46:28,166
I opened it for a friend.
Remember my friend Laura?

327
00:47:37,166 --> 00:47:39,445
Cheers.

328
00:47:39,447 --> 00:47:42,447
Tack.

329
00:47:47,327 --> 00:47:50,327
Did they hurt you?
No, I'm OK.

330
00:47:53,646 --> 00:47:56,646
Ana told me about something she dreamt.

331
00:47:57,286 --> 00:48:00,286
You had come home to the flat
and the bedroom was full of sand.

332
00:48:10,806 --> 00:48:13,806
I asked her where Mateo was.

333
00:48:15,927 --> 00:48:18,927
She said she didn't know.

334
00:48:19,086 --> 00:48:22,086
But she believed he was buried under the sand.

335
00:48:23,086 --> 00:48:26,086
Why are you going?

336
00:48:26,126 --> 00:48:29,126
Stay.

337
00:48:37,487 --> 00:48:40,487
I think you'll see me differently.

338
00:48:41,606 --> 00:48:44,606
I don't think it's a good idea.

339
00:48:44,847 --> 00:48:47,847
We both know what will happen.
There's room for everyone here.

340
00:48:48,126 --> 00:48:50,045
From the kitchen you get a glimpse of the sea.

341
00:48:50,047 --> 00:48:53,047
We can have breakfast together like we used to.

342
00:48:53,927 --> 00:48:56,286
I can make toast for you

343
00:48:56,286 --> 00:48:59,286
Be quiet a moment.
The children need me.

344
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:03,927
The can't wake up to a new father every weekend.

345
00:49:04,086 --> 00:49:06,166
You always come out with that crap.

346
00:49:06,166 --> 00:49:09,166
It's not just about the kids.
I need you.

347
00:49:09,487 --> 00:49:12,487
I haven't had a relapse in five months.

348
00:49:12,927 --> 00:49:15,927
Give me a chance, darling.

349
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:19,646
You've said that a hundred times.

350
00:49:19,646 --> 00:49:22,646
I haven't had a turn for ages.
It's different now, I promise.

351
00:49:24,007 --> 00:49:25,766
Are you taking those tablets?

352
00:49:25,766 --> 00:49:28,726
You got me to stop taking them
so I could breastfeed Mateo.

353
00:49:28,726 --> 00:49:31,606
You're obsessed with those damned pills.

354
00:49:31,606 --> 00:49:34,326
The doctor said you had to

355
00:49:34,327 --> 00:49:37,327
The doctor says anything to get rid of me.

356
00:49:38,126 --> 00:49:41,126
None of that shit is going to cure my depression.

357
00:49:44,126 --> 00:49:47,126
I'm trying with a lightbox now.
With a what?

358
00:49:47,367 --> 00:49:50,367
A lightbox. It's terrific.

359
00:49:50,927 --> 00:49:53,927
And much cheaper than medicine.
Can I show you?

360
00:50:10,407 --> 00:50:13,407
You see?

361
00:50:14,806 --> 00:50:17,286
It really is terrific.

362
00:50:17,286 --> 00:50:20,286
I started a couple of months ago.

363
00:50:21,887 --> 00:50:24,887
I feel better than ever.
But not like before.

364
00:50:25,766 --> 00:50:28,766
It's different now.
I feel normal.

365
00:50:29,206 --> 00:50:32,206
Like everyone else.

366
00:51:19,606 --> 00:51:22,606
No, stop it Marambra.

367
00:51:26,246 --> 00:51:28,606
No, cut it out

368
00:51:28,606 --> 00:51:31,606
Stop.

369
00:51:36,206 --> 00:51:39,085
It's OK.

370
00:51:39,086 --> 00:51:42,086
You're really tired.

371
00:51:42,166 --> 00:51:45,166
Besides, I'm getting old.
No.no.what are you talking about?

372
00:51:48,166 --> 00:51:51,166
That's me.
At the police station

373
00:51:53,126 --> 00:51:56,126
couldn't I stop thinking

374
00:51:57,007 --> 00:52:00,007
about coming back to
you and the kids again.

375
00:52:05,646 --> 00:52:08,646
The kids and I need

376
00:52:13,407 --> 00:52:16,407
Do you remember the time we fucked
in the little cloakroom?

377
00:52:18,887 --> 00:52:21,887
I'd just come to Barcelona
and you greeted me at the drycleaners

378
00:52:22,766 --> 00:52:25,766
You took me in the cloakroom.

379
00:52:26,487 --> 00:52:29,487
The owner caught us

380
00:53:15,927 --> 00:53:18,927
Up you get!

381
00:53:20,086 --> 00:53:23,086
It's six-thirty.
There's bread and tea out there.

382
00:53:24,887 --> 00:53:27,887
Get moving!

383
00:54:00,086 --> 00:54:02,726
I'm always getting into all kinds of crap.

384
00:54:02,726 --> 00:54:05,726
There are four underage minors.
I don't pay in advance.

385
00:54:06,327 --> 00:54:09,327
If we get inspected, where will I hide
so many damned Chinese?

386
00:54:09,487 --> 00:54:11,005
It's our only condition, Mendoza.

387
00:54:11,007 --> 00:54:14,007
I don't pay a cent til I know I've got something

388
00:54:14,927 --> 00:54:17,726
That's how we always do it.
Right, Uxbal?

389
00:54:17,726 --> 00:54:18,766
A week on trial.

390
00:54:18,766 --> 00:54:21,686
Half of them are sick and frozen.

391
00:54:21,686 --> 00:54:24,525
They've never even seen a drill.

392
00:54:24,527 --> 00:54:27,527
It doesn't help cut costs.

393
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:30,286
The costs?

394
00:54:30,286 --> 00:54:33,286
OK.

395
00:54:33,806 --> 00:54:36,806
Then you can go and hire
unionised construction workers.

396
00:54:38,367 --> 00:54:41,367
When you've worked it out, ring me.

397
00:54:52,126 --> 00:54:55,126
When do you need the money?
A week from today.

398
00:54:56,686 --> 00:54:59,686
Stop looking like a scared Chinaman..
I'll pay for next week.

399
00:55:00,447 --> 00:55:03,206
But then I'll have the papers latest on Friday.

400
00:55:03,206 --> 00:55:05,166
Ok, OK.

401
00:56:37,567 --> 00:56:40,567
On Anas birthday
could the four of us go to the country?

402
00:56:41,126 --> 00:56:43,925
Only at the weekend.

403
00:56:43,927 --> 00:56:46,485
Sure. Where to?
Dunno.

404
00:56:46,487 --> 00:56:49,126
The Pyrenees.
The kids have never seen snow.

405
00:56:49,126 --> 00:56:51,365
They've never been out of this part of town.

406
00:56:51,367 --> 00:56:53,925
We can camp.

407
00:56:53,927 --> 00:56:56,927
No, I'd rather have a dog, a little dog

408
00:56:57,766 --> 00:57:00,766
No, darling. They poo all day
and cost a fortune.

409
00:57:01,487 --> 00:57:04,445
Travelling's much more fun.
Give me a bit.

410
00:57:04,447 --> 00:57:07,447
I gotta taste it.

411
00:57:08,487 --> 00:57:11,485
What are you doing, Marambra?
Do you want to taste it?

412
00:57:11,487 --> 00:57:14,487
Use your spoon. Don't do that
You're disgusting.

413
00:57:15,246 --> 00:57:18,246
Good, eh?
Wanna try?

414
00:57:18,407 --> 00:57:20,405
Do it.

415
00:57:20,407 --> 00:57:22,126
Stick your hand in.

416
00:57:22,126 --> 00:57:25,005
Once more.

417
00:57:25,007 --> 00:57:28,007
Isn't that great?
Stop it.

418
00:57:31,927 --> 00:57:34,927
What are you grumbling about?
Or don't you remember when you proposed to me?

419
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:37,925
What'd he do?

420
00:57:37,927 --> 00:57:40,927
If you're gonna tell the story
tell about the look you gave me.

421
00:57:42,166 --> 00:57:45,166
You and your look.
I hadn't seen you yet.

422
00:57:45,246 --> 00:57:48,246
Hadn't you ever seen me?
I'm telling this, not you.

423
00:57:49,806 --> 00:57:52,806
The day I met your dad
at a party he said

424
00:57:53,206 --> 00:57:56,206
that I had the most beautiful nose he had ever seen.

425
00:57:57,646 --> 00:58:00,405
And obviously I believed him.

426
00:58:00,407 --> 00:58:03,407
Then he took my hand
to read my future.

427
00:58:04,487 --> 00:58:07,487
He said that I'd get married
to a completely hopeless man-

428
00:58:08,206 --> 00:58:10,646
but that I'd be
truly loved.

429
00:58:10,646 --> 00:58:13,646
Who knows how many birds he'd
used that on, but it worked with me.

430
00:58:14,527 --> 00:58:17,527
He said that if I let go of his hand
it wouldn't come true.

431
00:58:18,447 --> 00:58:21,405
And straightaway,
befrore I knew what was happening-

432
00:58:21,407 --> 00:58:24,407
he pulled my hand towards his nose-

433
00:58:25,487 --> 00:58:28,487
and shoved my finger up his nostril.

434
00:58:29,726 --> 00:58:32,206
He dug out a booger
and lay it in my hand-

435
00:58:32,206 --> 00:58:35,206
and said that I'd always have
part of him with me.

436
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:38,887
A black hairy piece of snot.
It was disgusting.

437
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:41,806
So what are you whining about?

438
00:58:41,806 --> 00:58:44,806
It's not true.
Would you believe I'd do something like that?

439
00:59:32,286 --> 00:59:34,246
Whadda you want?

440
00:59:34,246 --> 00:59:37,246
Have you come to beg forgiveness?

441
00:59:40,567 --> 00:59:43,567
Money?
Don't give me any frigging money.

442
00:59:44,126 --> 00:59:46,485
Say sorry to them too.

443
00:59:46,487 --> 00:59:49,487
Just seeing you if you hadn't had kids I'd have killed you.

444
00:59:50,766 --> 00:59:52,885
They knew what they were doing.

445
00:59:52,887 --> 00:59:55,887
They were illegals and they pushed drugs.

446
00:59:56,246 --> 00:59:59,246
Ekweme and the others knew they couldn't be here.

447
00:59:59,606 --> 01:00:01,925
The police won't allow it.

448
01:00:01,927 --> 01:00:04,686
Understand?

449
01:00:04,686 --> 01:00:07,686
Take the fucking money.

450
01:00:09,646 --> 01:00:12,646
Me?
What'll I do with my kid?

451
01:00:14,567 --> 01:00:17,567
Dunno. Dunno.

452
01:02:39,967 --> 01:02:42,967
Here, drink this.

453
01:02:49,887 --> 01:02:51,885
How are things with your wife?

454
01:02:51,887 --> 01:02:54,405
OK. Better.

455
01:02:54,407 --> 01:02:57,407
And the children?
The kids are fine.

456
01:02:58,206 --> 01:03:00,405
And you?

457
01:03:00,407 --> 01:03:03,407
You're dying.

458
01:03:03,766 --> 01:03:06,085
Looks like it.

459
01:03:06,086 --> 01:03:09,086
Spit.

460
01:03:20,806 --> 01:03:22,925
How's life looking?

461
01:03:22,927 --> 01:03:25,927
Are you prepared to leave it?

462
01:03:26,487 --> 01:03:29,487
Yes, I think so.
I'm working on it.

463
01:03:29,927 --> 01:03:32,927
You think so?
You've got to be sure.

464
01:03:33,166 --> 01:03:35,965
Get your life in order.
Leave nothing undone.

465
01:03:35,967 --> 01:03:38,967
I don't want to die, Bea.

466
01:03:40,126 --> 01:03:43,126
I'm afraid
to leave the kids in the lurch.

467
01:03:43,646 --> 01:03:46,646
Do you believe that it's you
who looks after the children?

468
01:03:47,047 --> 01:03:50,005
Don't be naive, Uxbal.
The Universe looks after them.

469
01:03:50,007 --> 01:03:53,007
Yes, but the universe doesn't pay the rent.

470
01:03:56,686 --> 01:03:59,405
When I was Ana's age-

471
01:03:59,407 --> 01:04:02,407
my mum died.
I scarcely remember her.

472
01:04:02,847 --> 01:04:05,847
My dad died without me ever meeting him.

473
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:10,286
That won't happen with my kids.

474
01:04:10,286 --> 01:04:13,286
Tell them.
Tell them everything.

475
01:04:14,166 --> 01:04:17,166
We know the dead'll never be in peace
if they're in debt to the living.

476
01:04:17,726 --> 01:04:20,726
Why is this happening to me?
Is it punishment?

477
01:04:22,407 --> 01:04:24,606
You can give up and let go-

478
01:04:24,606 --> 01:04:27,606
or hang on like stupid people do.

479
01:04:28,246 --> 01:04:30,525
It's a long, strenuous journey, Uxbal.

480
01:04:30,527 --> 01:04:33,527
Death is not the end, you know that.

481
01:04:34,447 --> 01:04:37,326
I won't die, Bea.

482
01:04:37,327 --> 01:04:40,327
No.

483
01:04:42,007 --> 01:04:45,007
No.

484
01:04:49,047 --> 01:04:52,047
Yes, you will die.

485
01:04:52,887 --> 01:04:55,887
I see it
and there's nothing I can do.

486
01:04:56,927 --> 01:04:59,927
Put your life in order, Uxbal.
That's all that matters.

487
01:05:02,766 --> 01:05:05,766
Chemo's poison.

488
01:05:17,447 --> 01:05:20,005
What did you have for breakfast?

489
01:05:20,007 --> 01:05:23,007
Milk coffee.

490
01:05:26,567 --> 01:05:29,567
You've always been a handsome boy.

491
01:05:30,007 --> 01:05:33,007
Remember what I said
the day we met?

492
01:05:33,246 --> 01:05:36,246
That we got our free gift

493
01:05:36,847 --> 01:05:39,847
so we'll pass it on.

494
01:05:46,047 --> 01:05:47,485
Here.

495
01:05:47,487 --> 01:05:50,045
When it's necessary,
give them to the children.


496
01:05:50,047 --> 01:05:52,925
What is it?
For protection.

497
01:05:52,927 --> 01:05:55,525
When you leave them-

498
01:05:55,527 --> 01:05:58,527
give them one each.

499
01:06:20,927 --> 01:06:23,927
He said it felt like
a sea of mud inside him.

500
01:06:25,007 --> 01:06:27,965
And his eyes felt like jelly-

501
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:30,967
and his hair burnt.

502
01:07:15,567 --> 01:07:18,567
Everybody up. It's 6.30.

503
01:07:34,646 --> 01:07:37,646
How many stoves did Uxbal bring?
Six.

504
01:07:48,447 --> 01:07:50,606
How's Ana?

505
01:07:50,606 --> 01:07:52,565
Hi, Lili.

506
01:07:52,567 --> 01:07:55,405
How're things?

507
01:07:55,407 --> 01:07:58,407
I hope the stoves'll stop you from freezing.

508
01:07:59,327 --> 01:08:01,646
Ana feels fine.
She wants to meet you.

509
01:08:01,646 --> 01:08:04,646
We've moved in with her mother
she misses you.

510
01:08:05,086 --> 01:08:08,086
I miss her too.
She loves to play with Li.

511
01:08:11,166 --> 01:08:14,166
Uxbal, Hai wants to talk to you.

512
01:08:16,447 --> 01:08:19,447
See you, Lili.
Bye. Say goodbye.

513
01:08:21,726 --> 01:08:23,365
Not one more day.

514
01:08:23,367 --> 01:08:26,367
If you want to have them sew 16 hours
a day and exploit them as

515
01:08:26,966 --> 01:08:29,485
Exploit them?
Yes, exploit them.

516
01:08:29,487 --> 01:08:32,286
D'you know how much they earn in China?

517
01:08:32,287 --> 01:08:34,485
Half a dollar a day.

518
01:08:34,487 --> 01:08:37,487
Millions of Chinese'd suck my cock
every morning to be here

519
01:08:38,327 --> 01:08:41,286
You forget I negotiated
a salary for each worker.

520
01:08:41,287 --> 01:08:44,287
And I can see down there they're obviously getting fuck-all.

521
01:08:46,046 --> 01:08:48,046
But I don't give a stuff about that.

522
01:08:48,046 --> 01:08:51,046
Just give me my share, like we agreed.


523
01:08:51,447 --> 01:08:53,605
Agreed to what?

524
01:08:53,606 --> 01:08:55,765
Agreed to what?

525
01:08:55,766 --> 01:08:57,605
You fucking piece of rotten meat!

526
01:08:57,606 --> 01:09:00,286
It's my money, you cunt!

527
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:02,565
It's mine!

528
01:09:02,567 --> 01:09:05,567
It's my money for fuck's sake!
Mine!

529
01:09:15,006 --> 01:09:18,006
Fucking blood-sucker.
If you don't starve to death it's due to me.

530
01:09:18,966 --> 01:09:21,166
If the Chinese have work
it's thanks to me.

531
01:09:21,167 --> 01:09:23,886
If you two aren't locked up
it's thanks to me.

532
01:09:23,886 --> 01:09:26,886
If you don't give me half
of Mendozas money, I swear I'll
533
What'll you do?
Who d'you think you are?

533
01:09:31,127 --> 01:09:34,127
You turn everything to your own advantage

534
01:09:34,207 --> 01:09:37,207
Uxbal

535
01:10:16,926 --> 01:10:19,926
They're putting me out in the morning.
You gotta stay at Samuel's.

536
01:10:21,006 --> 01:10:23,926
We're not staying without you.
Samuel's a Spaniard

537
01:10:23,926 --> 01:10:26,926
Samuel's Senegalese like me.
We go back with you.

538
01:10:29,167 --> 01:10:32,167
We'll be together again.
We're still young.

539
01:10:33,167 --> 01:10:35,485
Stay.

540
01:10:35,487 --> 01:10:37,365
Stay here at his place
 and go on studying.


541
01:10:37,367 --> 01:10:40,367
Work at the chicken factory again.
I send money to you.

542
01:10:41,527 --> 01:10:44,527
Even if I chop off a million chicken heads-

543
01:10:46,046 --> 01:10:49,046
we can never afford a house here.
We don't belong here.

544
01:10:49,207 --> 01:10:52,207
Why would you go back
to Senegal?

545
01:10:52,327 --> 01:10:55,327
There's no work at all.

546
01:11:05,567 --> 01:11:08,567
A man from the police came.

547
01:11:08,766 --> 01:11:11,766
He said we're all being evicted.
Everyone. They gave us til Monday.

548
01:11:14,287 --> 01:11:17,246
Uxbal 'll fix it.

549
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:19,445
I trust him.

550
01:11:19,447 --> 01:11:22,447
I've already spoken to him.

551
01:11:24,367 --> 01:11:27,367
Let him help us.

552
01:11:48,567 --> 01:11:51,246
Hi.

553
01:11:51,247 --> 01:11:54,247
Why're you looking like that?
What's happened to you?

554
01:11:54,726 --> 01:11:57,726
Why'd you do it?
You needn't 've gone overboard.

555
01:12:00,167 --> 01:12:03,167
Is that why you asked me to come?
To scold me?

556
01:12:06,367 --> 01:12:09,367
What could've I done?
They do what the fuck they want.

557
01:12:10,646 --> 01:12:12,365
What were you thinking?

558
01:12:12,367 --> 01:12:15,367
Were you the only one who didn't know
they were drug pushers?

559
01:12:15,447 --> 01:12:18,447
I warned you Uxbal.
We had to stop the niggers.

560
01:12:20,006 --> 01:12:23,006
The money is not enough for everyone.
Should I live on my miserable salary?

561
01:12:24,806 --> 01:12:26,926
Or will you steal from me?

562
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:29,926
They're being pushed out.
There are women with little kids

563
01:12:30,367 --> 01:12:33,367
You aren't Mother Teresa.
You know what I mean.

564
01:12:33,686 --> 01:12:36,686
It's you who exploit them
so don't give us that shit.

565
01:12:37,006 --> 01:12:40,006
I don't exploit them.
I help them get a job.

566
01:12:41,046 --> 01:12:43,685
For money, like all the others.

567
01:12:43,686 --> 01:12:46,086
Want something?
No thanks.

568
01:12:46,087 --> 01:12:48,886
Do you remember Victor, Julia's son?

569
01:12:48,886 --> 01:12:51,886
He moved to Murcia to train tigers
 in a circus. He gave them food.

570
01:12:53,567 --> 01:12:55,966
They danced for him
and licked his face.

571
01:12:55,966 --> 01:12:58,525
I saw the show
with my daughter.

572
01:12:58,527 --> 01:13:01,527
She wanted to bring a tiger home
They seemed to love him.

573
01:13:03,686 --> 01:13:06,206
The other month
I met his mum.

574
01:13:06,207 --> 01:13:09,207
A tiger had torn off a piece
of his face and killed him.

575
01:13:10,846 --> 01:13:13,846
He gave them food every day.
Every day for six years.

576
01:13:15,006 --> 01:13:18,006
But he made a mistake.

577
01:13:18,567 --> 01:13:21,567
It's dangerous
to trust a starving man.

578
01:13:22,006 --> 01:13:24,365
'Specially if his kids are starving too.

579
01:13:24,367 --> 01:13:27,367
What's that got to do with anything?
What the fuck are you on about?

580
01:13:27,846 --> 01:13:30,846
You gotta help Ekweme.
He's being kicked out. You gotta help me.

581
01:13:32,046 --> 01:13:35,046
I'm not an MP.
I can't help you.

582
01:13:36,606 --> 01:13:39,606
I can't go on playing I'm the UN.

583
01:13:40,527 --> 01:13:43,527
I've got a daughter to look after.
D'you understand?

584
01:13:51,527 --> 01:13:54,527
Be careful, Uxbal.

585
01:13:55,447 --> 01:13:58,445
Or take an Alka Seltzer.
Chinese food can be very strong.

586
01:13:58,447 --> 01:14:00,086
There are so many of those yellow bastards-

587
01:14:00,087 --> 01:14:03,087
that in the end they'll have the best ham
and we'll get to eat rice.

588
01:14:34,726 --> 01:14:36,605
Daddy, did you know-

589
01:14:36,606 --> 01:14:39,606
that when owls die
they cough up a fur-ball?

590
01:14:40,287 --> 01:14:43,287
No, I didn't know that.
Not so loud, you'll wake up Mummy.

591
01:14:44,527 --> 01:14:47,525
Daddy, is mummy mad at us?

592
01:14:47,527 --> 01:14:50,527
No.

593
01:14:51,287 --> 01:14:53,086
Who's that?

594
01:14:53,087 --> 01:14:55,605
Your grandfather.
Let me see.

595
01:14:55,606 --> 01:14:58,606
That was the last photo taken of him
before he went off.


596
01:14:58,886 --> 01:15:01,886
My mum always kept it in her purse.

597
01:15:02,567 --> 01:15:05,046
Where'd he go to?

598
01:15:05,046 --> 01:15:06,886
To Mexico.

599
01:15:06,886 --> 01:15:09,886
He didn't just go, he fled.
Why'd he flee?

600
01:15:10,247 --> 01:15:13,247
'cause your grandfather
couldn't keep his mouth shut.

601
01:15:13,766 --> 01:15:16,766
At that time Franco persecuted and executed people
who couldn't keep their mouth shut.

602
01:15:20,407 --> 01:15:23,407
When he was 20 he fled from Spain
so as not to die

603
01:15:25,367 --> 01:15:28,367
but he died anyway 2 weeks later in Mexico
from a lung inflammation.

604
01:15:29,046 --> 01:15:32,046
Do you love him a lot?

605
01:15:34,006 --> 01:15:37,006
I don't know.
I never met him.

606
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:41,367
Not having a dad sucks.

607
01:15:43,527 --> 01:15:46,527
When are we going up to see the snow?
Mummy said we're taking the train.

608
01:15:47,686 --> 01:15:50,046
Bags a window-seat.
OK.

609
01:15:50,046 --> 01:15:51,685
If we're going up to the snow

610
01:15:51,686 --> 01:15:54,686
you gotta build up your strength
'cause there are tons of things to do.

611
01:15:55,846 --> 01:15:58,846
Sleeping time.

612
01:16:02,167 --> 01:16:05,167
Careful, It's heavy.

613
01:16:26,567 --> 01:16:29,567
Fuck it, it's sealed with zinc.

614
01:16:30,447 --> 01:16:33,447
Pass me the hammer and chisel.

615
01:16:39,646 --> 01:16:42,246
Fuck, he's embalmed.

616
01:16:42,247 --> 01:16:43,926
We take it as it is.

617
01:16:43,926 --> 01:16:46,926
placed the remains
of Mateo Gama Fernandez

618
01:16:47,247 --> 01:16:50,247
in department 27
Saint Joseph year 1966.

619
01:16:51,247 --> 01:16:53,645
Wonderful. Everything in order.

620
01:16:53,646 --> 01:16:55,645
Your father died in Mexico.

621
01:16:55,646 --> 01:16:58,646
Therefore he was embalmed
before being sent back here by sea

622
01:16:59,207 --> 01:17:01,966
I'm telling you this because the formaldehyde really works

623
01:17:01,966 --> 01:17:04,326
and cremation can take a long time.

624
01:17:04,327 --> 01:17:07,327
The body's driven
to Montjuic crematorium.

625
01:17:07,886 --> 01:17:10,886
I suppose you'll want an urn.

626
01:17:13,247 --> 01:17:16,247
These are his belongings.
They were in the coffin.

627
01:17:19,087 --> 01:17:22,087
Can we see the body?

628
01:17:22,127 --> 01:17:25,127
If you want, but people tend not to.

629
01:17:26,926 --> 01:17:29,926
But if you wish
I'll call Montjuic right away.

630
01:17:36,447 --> 01:17:39,447
Tony, please open the bag for identification.

631
01:19:36,127 --> 01:19:39,046
Sorry, the door was open

632
01:19:39,046 --> 01:19:42,046
I'm coming now.

633
01:19:48,367 --> 01:19:51,367
Sometimes the fridge hums

634
01:19:51,806 --> 01:19:54,806
but if you give it a bang it'll stop.

635
01:19:56,006 --> 01:19:57,845
There's hot water

636
01:19:57,846 --> 01:20:00,846
but it's best to shower after 10 o'clock. OK??

637
01:20:02,447 --> 01:20:04,725
I think that's everything.

638
01:20:04,726 --> 01:20:07,726
Kids' room

639
01:20:08,606 --> 01:20:11,006
If you like you can be in here.

640
01:20:11,006 --> 01:20:14,006
The rent is paid for the next few months.

641
01:20:23,846 --> 01:20:26,846
Fuck

642
01:20:36,327 --> 01:20:39,327
Are you.

643
01:20:39,367 --> 01:20:42,367
Are you OK?

644
01:21:18,686 --> 01:21:21,686
I didn't know you did massage customers
in the middle of the night.

645
01:21:22,006 --> 01:21:24,645
You scared me.

646
01:21:24,646 --> 01:21:27,166
You should see the sky.

647
01:21:27,167 --> 01:21:30,167
It's full of stars.

648
01:21:31,487 --> 01:21:34,126
It's a damned nuisance that ants
always come in here.

649
01:21:34,127 --> 01:21:37,127
Ana said you caught them by smoking
and the mattress caught on fire.

650
01:21:38,806 --> 01:21:41,806
Where have you been?
Can't I have a bit of fun?

651
01:21:42,487 --> 01:21:45,365
Not with 2 children alone at home

652
01:21:45,367 --> 01:21:47,805
who don't know where you are.
And dressed like that.

653
01:21:47,806 --> 01:21:50,806
So it's my fault?
Now I gotta ask your permission to be Mummy.

654
01:21:51,806 --> 01:21:54,405
That's what happens
when a seven year old smokes.

655
01:21:54,407 --> 01:21:57,006
Things start to burn.
Or didn't you know Mateo smoked?

656
01:21:57,006 --> 01:22:00,006
You can't leave them, nor can you throw
a burning mattress out the window

657
01:22:01,046 --> 01:22:04,046
and make them carry it up.
He's only seven.

658
01:22:04,966 --> 01:22:07,966
But he can already hurt others
like he was 40.

659
01:22:10,646 --> 01:22:13,646
He wanted to open the fridge

660
01:22:14,167 --> 01:22:17,167
with wet feet.

661
01:22:20,606 --> 01:22:23,606
And he called me a whore.

662
01:22:26,006 --> 01:22:29,006
The more love I give him

663
01:22:29,167 --> 01:22:32,167
the more he calls me nasty names.

664
01:22:34,327 --> 01:22:37,327
He said it was my fault
that we separated.

665
01:22:38,766 --> 01:22:41,086
Did you hit him?

666
01:22:41,087 --> 01:22:44,087
No.

667
01:22:49,287 --> 01:22:52,287
Yes you did.

668
01:22:58,567 --> 01:23:01,567
It's the only way he'll learn.

669
01:23:15,327 --> 01:23:18,327
I bought the train tickets.

670
01:23:18,966 --> 01:23:21,966
Four seats in first class.

671
01:23:22,806 --> 01:23:25,806
I found a cute B&B
where we can spend the night.

672
01:23:28,247 --> 01:23:31,247
The kids are so looking forward to the trip.

673
01:23:31,527 --> 01:23:34,445
They talk about the Pyrenees-

674
01:23:34,447 --> 01:23:37,447
like they were Disneyland.

675
01:23:40,407 --> 01:23:43,407
My darling one, what you see ou there are not stars.


676
01:23:44,487 --> 01:23:47,487
It's your nervous system.

677
01:23:50,127 --> 01:23:53,127
You could at least show you care.

678
01:24:55,046 --> 01:24:58,046
We're ruined.

679
01:24:59,846 --> 01:25:02,846
Finished.

680
01:25:03,247 --> 01:25:06,046
We could have

681
01:25:06,046 --> 01:25:08,765
Shut up. It was your idea.

682
01:25:08,766 --> 01:25:11,766
What's happened? Where are they?

683
01:25:12,046 --> 01:25:14,886
Where are they?
You fucking piece of shit!

684
01:25:14,886 --> 01:25:17,805
You fucking murderer!
Shut up!

685
01:25:17,806 --> 01:25:20,806
It was your idea too.
We gotta scram.

686
01:25:21,287 --> 01:25:24,287
I don't wanna end up in jail.
No one ever does.

687
01:25:24,686 --> 01:25:27,686
Where are they?

688
01:25:29,766 --> 01:25:32,766
Down there in the cellar.

689
01:25:33,686 --> 01:25:36,565
We gotta decide what to do
with the one that's alive.

690
01:25:36,567 --> 01:25:38,845
There's one that's alive?

691
01:25:38,846 --> 01:25:41,846
There were two, but we couldn't
One of them died.

692
01:25:42,327 --> 01:25:44,725
Could be seen as suicide.

693
01:25:44,726 --> 01:25:47,645
Promise me no one will know anything.

694
01:25:47,646 --> 01:25:50,646
I'll give you all the money you need.
Just say how much.

695
01:26:56,487 --> 01:26:59,487
Help me, help me!.

696
01:27:01,046 --> 01:27:03,886
What are you doing?

697
01:27:03,886 --> 01:27:05,006
Help me!

698
01:27:05,006 --> 01:27:08,006
Uxbal, leave her alone.
She's already dead.

699
01:29:08,567 --> 01:29:11,086
What'll we do?

700
01:29:11,087 --> 01:29:13,886
You gotta help me.

701
01:29:13,886 --> 01:29:16,886
I don't know.
Lock the goddamned warehouse.

702
01:29:30,367 --> 01:29:33,367
Hang on, Marambra.
Dear Marambra, listen to me.

703
01:29:34,006 --> 01:29:36,326
Listen to me.

704
01:29:36,327 --> 01:29:38,966
Take the train this evening,
and we'll see in the morning.

705
01:29:38,966 --> 01:29:41,805
Don't change the plan.
Don't change a fucking thing.

706
01:29:41,806 --> 01:29:44,806
Take the kids
and go to the Pyrenees

707
01:29:46,606 --> 01:29:49,606
Tell Ana I'm sorry,
but we'll have her birthday party when she comes home.

708
01:30:22,766 --> 01:30:25,766
I tried to pray, but I don't know
who I should pray to.

709
01:30:27,167 --> 01:30:30,167
Haven't you slept at all?
Out with it.

710
01:30:33,646 --> 01:30:36,646
I bought the damned stoves
because they were cheapest.

711
01:30:39,367 --> 01:30:42,367
Because I needed
the goddamned money.

712
01:30:44,167 --> 01:30:47,167
I knew the stoves were rejects.

713
01:30:48,527 --> 01:30:51,527
It's my fault, Bea.
All my fault

714
01:31:04,726 --> 01:31:07,726
They're all dead.

715
01:31:11,247 --> 01:31:14,247
25 people, Bea.
There were women there.

716
01:31:16,606 --> 01:31:19,606
And children
Lili was there.

717
01:31:19,886 --> 01:31:22,886
I wanted to ask her to forgive me,
but she was already dead.

718
01:31:26,646 --> 01:31:29,646
I don't know if I'm going to the police.
I'm really frightened

719
01:31:31,207 --> 01:31:34,207
It was an accident, Uxbal.

720
01:31:34,726 --> 01:31:37,726
It's OK.

721
01:31:39,006 --> 01:31:42,006
You know what you must do, Uxbal.

722
01:31:43,686 --> 01:31:46,405
Go and find them

723
01:31:46,407 --> 01:31:48,086
and beg their forgiveness.

724
01:31:48,087 --> 01:31:51,046
No, not that

725
01:31:51,046 --> 01:31:54,046
Not that

726
01:35:01,127 --> 01:35:02,886
Tito

727
01:35:02,886 --> 01:35:04,886
Where's the prodigal son.

728
01:35:04,886 --> 01:35:07,286
What's up with you?
I've been trying to get hold of you.

729
01:35:07,287 --> 01:35:10,287
I left a thousand messages.


730
01:35:12,567 --> 01:35:15,567
Why don't you answer when I call?
Come here.

731
01:35:16,207 --> 01:35:19,207
This is my out-of-reach brother.

732
01:35:19,606 --> 01:35:21,365
What will you have to drink?

733
01:35:21,367 --> 01:35:23,206
Dunno.
Clara!

734
01:35:23,207 --> 01:35:26,207
Mendoza went ballistic.
He nearly cut my balls off.

735
01:35:26,287 --> 01:35:29,287
Cclara, give me one.two Jack Daniel's.

736
01:35:29,726 --> 01:35:32,726
None of the Chinese came to work.
These sort of delays cost a fortune.

737
01:35:33,247 --> 01:35:36,086
What happened?
There was a problem, Tito.

738
01:35:36,087 --> 01:35:39,087
What the hell?
Why didn't you come to me?

739
01:35:39,886 --> 01:35:41,966
Because. I don't know.

740
01:35:41,966 --> 01:35:44,805
Come here, Cclarita.

741
01:35:44,806 --> 01:35:47,806
Drink, we'll discuss this in the morning.

742
01:35:47,846 --> 01:35:50,846
Hang on
I've got to talk to you, Tito.

743
01:35:51,527 --> 01:35:54,485
Here you gotta scream
or be on top of one another.

744
01:35:54,487 --> 01:35:57,487
Look at her there.

745
01:36:02,886 --> 01:36:05,126
Wow, you've got a thirst.

746
01:36:05,127 --> 01:36:07,485
Look behind me. The bird in pink.

747
01:36:07,487 --> 01:36:10,487
I've fucked her up the arse.
She loves to fuck.

748
01:36:11,766 --> 01:36:13,886
She's only a little girl.

749
01:36:13,886 --> 01:36:16,886
Cheers!

750
01:36:19,926 --> 01:36:22,926
I've got nothing.

751
01:36:29,567 --> 01:36:32,567
Here it is.

752
01:36:33,527 --> 01:36:36,527
Is Cchepas here?

753
01:36:38,006 --> 01:36:41,006
What's up with you?
Look at him.

754
01:36:41,646 --> 01:36:44,645
How long is it since you were out?

755
01:36:44,646 --> 01:36:47,646
It was at least 2 years ago.
Look at him now.

756
01:36:47,886 --> 01:36:50,725
He looks like the fucking Dalai Lama.

757
01:36:50,726 --> 01:36:53,726
Hrere.

758
01:37:00,407 --> 01:37:03,407
Hi darling.

759
01:37:08,407 --> 01:37:11,407
No, don't give him anything.

760
01:37:11,527 --> 01:37:13,886
Let him suffer.

761
01:37:13,886 --> 01:37:16,886
Look at him.

762
01:37:18,367 --> 01:37:21,367
Now we can talk.
Do you want a drink?

763
01:37:23,447 --> 01:37:26,447
Get Cchepa's stuff.
I'm going to the loo.

764
01:37:26,567 --> 01:37:29,567
Are you hungry for adventure, girls?
How come? We know you're gay.

765
01:37:36,487 --> 01:37:39,326
Your brother's an idiot.
Do you know that?

766
01:37:39,327 --> 01:37:42,327
Your brother's an idiot.
Yeah.

767
01:37:42,567 --> 01:37:45,567
Yeah, he sure is.

768
01:37:47,207 --> 01:37:50,207
And how many kids do you have?

769
01:37:51,487 --> 01:37:54,206
How many kids do you have?
Two.

770
01:37:54,207 --> 01:37:57,086
Where are they now?
They've gone away.

771
01:37:57,087 --> 01:37:58,645
They've gone up to the snow.

772
01:37:58,646 --> 01:38:01,405
Who with?
With their mum.

773
01:38:01,407 --> 01:38:04,407
Why didn't you go with them?
'cause I can't.

774
01:38:07,686 --> 01:38:09,805
Why can't you?

775
01:38:09,806 --> 01:38:12,365
Why can't you?

776
01:38:12,367 --> 01:38:15,367
Because I'm dying.

777
01:38:20,606 --> 01:38:23,606
I'm dying of cancer.

778
01:40:48,287 --> 01:40:51,287
PYRENEES IS BlUTlFUL

779
01:41:18,287 --> 01:41:21,287
Mateo, my sweet?

780
01:41:29,046 --> 01:41:31,605
Mateo.

781
01:41:31,606 --> 01:41:34,166
kiddo

782
01:41:34,167 --> 01:41:37,167
Why are you all alone?

783
01:41:38,686 --> 01:41:41,086
I wet myself.

784
01:41:41,087 --> 01:41:44,087
Don't worry about that.

785
01:41:44,207 --> 01:41:47,006
What happened?

786
01:41:47,006 --> 01:41:50,006
Mamma punished me.

787
01:41:51,006 --> 01:41:54,006
She left me here.
She went off with Ana.

788
01:41:55,006 --> 01:41:58,006
They went up to the snow.

789
01:42:00,287 --> 01:42:03,287
What have you done to your face?

790
01:42:04,087 --> 01:42:07,087
I was very disobedient.

791
01:42:22,327 --> 01:42:25,327
Daddy

792
01:42:31,726 --> 01:42:34,726
Daddy

793
01:42:42,926 --> 01:42:45,326
Let me explain.

794
01:42:45,327 --> 01:42:48,327
It was Ana's birthday and Mateo
Don't talk to me, Marambra.

795
01:43:07,567 --> 01:43:10,567
It's good you're moving.

796
01:43:12,247 --> 01:43:15,247
I'm really glad you're pissing off.
You hear that?

797
01:43:17,646 --> 01:43:20,086
Goddamned pig.

798
01:43:20,087 --> 01:43:23,087
You're a goddamned pig!
You can't even look at me, eh?

799
01:43:29,686 --> 01:43:32,686
Give me the photo, Marambra.

800
01:45:46,046 --> 01:45:49,046
His dad.

801
01:45:59,367 --> 01:46:02,367
Tell him to be quiet.
Quieten him.

802
01:46:03,127 --> 01:46:06,127
Sleep now, Mateo.

803
01:46:08,127 --> 01:46:11,127
Daddy, Why is Ige living at our place?

804
01:46:12,846 --> 01:46:15,846
'Cause he doesn't have any home of his own.

805
01:46:16,167 --> 01:46:18,166
And he has a little kid.

806
01:46:18,167 --> 01:46:21,167
Can I answer?
No, as I've already told you.

807
01:47:49,327 --> 01:47:51,725
Where are the kids?

808
01:47:51,726 --> 01:47:54,046
I followed them to school.

809
01:47:54,046 --> 01:47:57,046
Why didn't you wake me up?
You slept like a log.

810
01:47:57,886 --> 01:48:00,886
Ana said she knew the way
and Mateo thought it was OK.

811
01:48:04,327 --> 01:48:06,086
What time is it?

812
01:48:06,087 --> 01:48:09,087
I don't know, it must be one.

813
01:48:16,926 --> 01:48:19,926
If you like, I can pick up the kids.

814
01:49:01,447 --> 01:49:04,447
He went ballistic.

815
01:49:04,766 --> 01:49:07,766
Liwei betrayed me.
Everything was his idea.

816
01:49:09,087 --> 01:49:12,087
You know what sort of a guy he was.

817
01:49:14,846 --> 01:49:17,846
He threw them in, 300 metres out to sea.

818
01:49:18,127 --> 01:49:21,127
Shimuya swore
that the bodies sank to the bottom.

819
01:49:22,806 --> 01:49:25,806
Liwei thought you'd betray us.
I was afraid too.

820
01:49:27,487 --> 01:49:30,487
They've taken my family.
My daughter Suyin.

821
01:49:30,606 --> 01:49:33,405
To top it all off, Liwei came
looking for me and cried.

822
01:49:33,407 --> 01:49:36,407
This is insane.
What do you want me to do?

823
01:49:36,806 --> 01:49:39,806
What do you want me to do?

824
01:49:40,527 --> 01:49:43,527
We can't stand here.
Get away from here and be quick about it.

825
01:49:45,567 --> 01:49:48,006
What do you want?
You aren't innocent, Uxbal.

826
01:49:48,006 --> 01:49:51,006
What?
Don't play dumb.

827
01:49:56,726 --> 01:49:59,726
You gotta get it into your head.

828
01:50:00,966 --> 01:50:03,966
My people don't squeal.
I promise you.

829
01:50:04,886 --> 01:50:07,886
You gotta shut up anyone you know
who knows anything.

830
01:50:32,087 --> 01:50:35,087
<i>The news has shocked the whole country.</i>

831
01:50:35,846 --> 01:50:38,846
<i>The latest we know is
that most of the dead are men-</i>

832
01:50:39,567 --> 01:50:42,567
<i>-but among them were also found
two women and three children.</i>

833
01:50:44,247 --> 01:50:47,247
<i>We warn that these images may disturb some viewers.
The search for bodies continues</i>

834
01:50:48,006 --> 01:50:50,286
No, I don't know.

835
01:50:50,287 --> 01:50:53,086
It's not certain.
No, it's not certain.

836
01:50:53,087 --> 01:50:56,087
What? No.

837
01:50:56,287 --> 01:50:59,287
Near the Chinese's warehouse.
I don't know.

838
01:51:00,367 --> 01:51:03,367
One family or something.
Just a sec, there's someone at the door.

839
01:51:04,207 --> 01:51:07,207
No, no, no, don't hang up.

840
01:51:08,726 --> 01:51:11,725
What the hell are you doing here?

841
01:51:11,726 --> 01:51:14,726
I heard it right.
Why didn't you say anything to me?

842
01:51:14,966 --> 01:51:17,086
Are we talking about the same thing?
I dunno.

843
01:51:17,087 --> 01:51:20,087
Are we talking about the same thing?
This is terrible.

844
01:51:21,886 --> 01:51:24,886
Want a drink?

845
01:51:24,926 --> 01:51:26,765
Marambras purse?
Leave it alone.

846
01:51:26,766 --> 01:51:29,766
I don't understand.
Did you murder them, Uxbal?

847
01:51:30,367 --> 01:51:32,365
Fucking piece of shit.
For chrissakes, Uxbal

848
01:51:32,367 --> 01:51:35,367
Fucking piece of shit.

849
01:51:37,606 --> 01:51:40,606
<i>He was totally hysterical and stood and cried.
</i>

850
01:51:41,367 --> 01:51:44,367
What was I supposed to do?
Leave her out there?

851
01:51:45,127 --> 01:51:48,127
This is partly your fault, Uxbal.

852
01:51:48,686 --> 01:51:51,686
If I see you anywhere near
my wife or my children

853
01:51:52,926 --> 01:51:55,926
under a kilometre away,
I swear on my mother-

854
01:51:56,646 --> 01:51:59,646
-I'll kill you, you fucking piece of shit.

855
01:52:25,846 --> 01:52:28,846
I can't move.

856
01:52:29,886 --> 01:52:32,886
I feel like if I touched my neck-

857
01:52:33,087 --> 01:52:35,485
my head would fall off.

858
01:52:35,487 --> 01:52:38,487
Calm down. Nothing's
gonna fall off.

859
01:52:40,806 --> 01:52:43,405
If I close my eyes-

860
01:52:43,407 --> 01:52:46,407
the tanks are coming.

861
01:52:47,087 --> 01:52:50,087
They scare  me.

862
01:52:50,846 --> 01:52:53,846
I called you.
I rang you over and over.

863
01:52:55,806 --> 01:52:58,806
I don't have what the children need.

864
01:53:01,006 --> 01:53:04,006
I'm sorry I was nasty to Mateo.

865
01:53:07,487 --> 01:53:10,487
I do what I can
to survive.

866
01:53:12,487 --> 01:53:15,487
I want to be faithful to you.

867
01:53:15,846 --> 01:53:18,846
But i also want to have a bit of fun

868
01:53:19,207 --> 01:53:21,166
as a whore.

869
01:53:21,167 --> 01:53:24,167
Don't say that, Marambra.

870
01:53:26,247 --> 01:53:29,126
I'm sorry.

871
01:53:29,127 --> 01:53:31,565
I never knew
what I should give you.

872
01:53:31,567 --> 01:53:34,565
I still don't know.

873
01:53:34,567 --> 01:53:37,567
Come to think of it
I've never known it

874
01:53:39,487 --> 01:53:42,487
But we've hurt each other so much.

875
01:53:42,886 --> 01:53:45,886
Take me on a holiday again.

876
01:53:46,527 --> 01:53:49,326
At the clinic
they have to tie me

877
01:53:49,327 --> 01:53:51,485
Quiet.

878
01:53:51,487 --> 01:53:54,487
Quiet. It'll be OK
It's going to be OK.

879
01:57:04,447 --> 01:57:07,447
She is in the same house
where we visited her before.

880
01:57:08,447 --> 01:57:10,365
Remember?

881
01:57:10,367 --> 01:57:12,645
And she

882
01:57:12,646 --> 01:57:15,646
We must just let her rest.

883
01:57:16,087 --> 01:57:18,966
Take her hand?
Yes.

884
01:57:18,966 --> 01:57:21,966
She has 20 people
who take her hand.

885
01:57:25,846 --> 01:57:28,846
She sent lots of kisses.
She loves you lots and lots.

886
01:57:33,287 --> 01:57:36,287
Can we say hello to her?
Yes, of course darling.

887
01:57:36,646 --> 01:57:39,646
But now we have to let her rest.

888
01:57:59,686 --> 01:58:02,686
Make a wish, little lady.

889
01:58:12,287 --> 01:58:15,086
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

890
01:58:15,087 --> 01:58:18,087
Don't shove it up your nose.
Give me your hand.

891
01:58:20,087 --> 01:58:23,087
What's that? A booger?

892
01:58:26,207 --> 01:58:29,207
It's something you shall have
from your daddy.


893
01:58:32,367 --> 01:58:35,367
Are you scared of it?

894
01:58:35,646 --> 01:58:38,646
Do you promise?

895
01:58:39,806 --> 01:58:42,806
Are you frightened of it?
Yes.

896
01:58:44,367 --> 01:58:47,367
Shouldn't we have the cake now?
Sit down , Ige.

897
01:58:48,006 --> 01:58:49,845
OK

898
01:58:49,846 --> 01:58:52,645
The first thing we must do

899
01:58:52,646 --> 01:58:55,166
Mateo, don't be disgusting.

900
01:58:55,167 --> 01:58:58,167
is to eat
yummy chocolate cake.

901
01:59:08,127 --> 01:59:11,127
The kids are so fond of you Ige.

902
01:59:11,247 --> 01:59:14,247
You and Samuel.

903
01:59:15,646 --> 01:59:18,646
You have a home here.
And you can stay as long as you want.

904
01:59:19,966 --> 01:59:22,966
No, Uxbal.
I'm also fond of the children-

905
01:59:24,646 --> 01:59:27,646
but I'll save up some money
and then I'm going back.

906
01:59:29,167 --> 01:59:31,725
This is no place for us.

907
01:59:31,726 --> 01:59:34,726
Ekweme told me about

908
01:59:36,766 --> 01:59:39,766
Wait.

909
01:59:50,806 --> 01:59:53,806
Here is enough for rent for a whole year-

910
01:59:54,766 --> 01:59:57,006
and much more.

911
01:59:57,006 --> 02:00:00,006
All for the children.
Do you understand?

912
02:00:02,287 --> 02:00:05,287
Take the money.

913
02:00:06,846 --> 02:00:09,846
Take them.

914
02:00:12,046 --> 02:00:15,046
Ige, please

915
02:00:15,046 --> 02:00:17,485
Can't you stay?

916
02:00:17,487 --> 02:00:20,487
I need your help.

917
02:00:20,926 --> 02:00:23,926
Take it now. Take it.

918
02:00:40,367 --> 02:00:43,367
Goddamn

919
02:00:52,606 --> 02:00:54,445
What is it?

920
02:00:54,447 --> 02:00:56,805
Nothing.

921
02:00:56,806 --> 02:00:59,806
Why aren't you in school?
Don't lie to me Daddy.

922
02:01:10,926 --> 02:01:13,926
Come here.

923
02:01:25,207 --> 02:01:28,207
Does your brother know anything about this?

924
02:01:32,966 --> 02:01:35,966
You can't leave us.

925
02:01:38,087 --> 02:01:41,087
I won't.

926
02:01:46,726 --> 02:01:49,726
Look in my eyes.

927
02:01:50,806 --> 02:01:53,806
Look at my face.

928
02:01:54,527 --> 02:01:57,527
Promise to remember me.

929
02:01:57,567 --> 02:02:00,525
Don't forget me, Ana.

930
02:02:00,527 --> 02:02:03,527
Don't forget me, my darling.

931
02:03:45,806 --> 02:03:48,806
'Bye.

932
02:04:55,966 --> 02:04:58,966
Ige?

933
02:05:00,726 --> 02:05:03,726
Ige?

934
02:05:03,766 --> 02:05:06,766
yes, it's me.
I'm back.

935
02:07:17,407 --> 02:07:20,407
Daddy, are you OK?

936
02:07:26,567 --> 02:07:28,966
Yes, darling.

937
02:07:28,966 --> 02:07:30,805
Does it hurt?

938
02:07:30,806 --> 02:07:33,006
No.

939
02:07:33,006 --> 02:07:36,006
I can't sleep. Light

940
02:07:59,127 --> 02:08:02,127
The ring looks funny on your hand.

941
02:08:04,367 --> 02:08:07,367
Can I look at it?

942
02:08:11,766 --> 02:08:14,766
Is it real?
Yes.

943
02:08:17,487 --> 02:08:20,487
It was from my daddy to my mummy.

944
02:08:21,327 --> 02:08:24,327
And why have you got it?

945
02:08:25,966 --> 02:08:28,565
To

946
02:08:28,567 --> 02:08:31,326
your grandfather gave it
to your grandmother

947
02:08:31,327 --> 02:08:34,327
before he left Spain.

948
02:08:35,287 --> 02:08:38,287
She was pregnant and expecting me

949
02:08:38,606 --> 02:08:41,166
and she never saw him again.

950
02:08:41,167 --> 02:08:44,167
It's lovely. I never thought
I'd touch a real diamond.

951
02:08:47,327 --> 02:08:50,327
Can I try it on?
Yes.

952
02:09:00,247 --> 02:09:03,247
It's yours now darling.
Really?

953
02:09:04,367 --> 02:09:07,367
Mummy always wore it
on this finger.

954
02:09:08,447 --> 02:09:11,447
She said it wasn't real.

955
02:09:16,207 --> 02:09:18,886
Your mother never heard the sound.

956
02:09:18,886 --> 02:09:20,645
What sound?

957
02:10:12,287 --> 02:10:15,287
The sound of the sea.

958
02:12:34,375 --> 02:12:40,085
