00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,280
Hi there. I want to talk
to you about ducts.

10
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:20,055
Do your ducts seem
old-fashioned, out-of-date?

11
00:01:20,162 --> 00:01:23,155
Central Services's
new duct designs...

12
00:01:23,265 --> 00:01:26,496
are now available in hundreds
of different colors...

13
00:01:26,602 --> 00:01:29,468
to suit your individual taste.

14
00:01:29,572 --> 00:01:35,340
Hurry now, while stocks last, to your
nearest Central Services showroom.

15
00:01:35,444 --> 00:01:39,245
Designer colors to suit
your demanding taste.

16
00:01:58,734 --> 00:02:02,727
Tonight we have with us, from
the Ministry of Information...

17
00:02:02,838 --> 00:02:05,501
Deputy Minister Eugene Helpmann.

18
00:02:05,608 --> 00:02:07,507
Good evening, David.

19
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:11,943
What do you believe is behind this
recent increase in terrorist bombings?

20
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:14,413
Bad sportsmanship.

21
00:02:14,516 --> 00:02:16,747
A ruthless minority of people...

22
00:02:16,853 --> 00:02:20,983
seems to have forgotten certain
good old-fashioned virtues.

23
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,320
They just can't stand
seeing the other fella win.

24
00:02:24,426 --> 00:02:26,951
If these people would
just play the game...

25
00:02:27,062 --> 00:02:29,122
they'd get a lot
more out of life.

26
00:02:29,231 --> 00:02:32,030
Nevertheless, Mr. Helpmann,
there are those who maintain...

27
00:02:32,134 --> 00:02:35,468
that the Ministry of Information
has become too large and unwieldy.

28
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:38,768
David, in a free society,
information's the name of the game.

29
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:41,639
You can't win the game
if you're a man short.

30
00:02:41,743 --> 00:02:43,810
And the cost of it
all, Deputy Minister.

31
00:02:43,835 --> 00:02:46,102
Seven percent of the
gross national product.

32
00:02:46,182 --> 00:02:49,413
I understand this concern
on behalf of the taxpayer.

33
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,418
People want value for money.

34
00:02:51,521 --> 00:02:54,579
That's why we always
insist on the principle

35
00:02:54,604 --> 00:02:56,914
of information
retrieval charges.

36
00:02:56,992 --> 00:03:00,086
It's absolutely
right and fair...

37
00:03:00,195 --> 00:03:03,426
that those found guilty should pay
for their periods of detention...

38
00:03:03,532 --> 00:03:08,026
<i>and for the information retrieval
procedures used in their interrogation.</i>

39
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:12,062
Do you believe that the government is
winning the battle against terrorists?

40
00:03:12,175 --> 00:03:15,974
Oh, yes. Our morale is
much higher than theirs.

41
00:03:16,078 --> 00:03:18,944
<i>We're fielding all their strokes,
running a lot of them out...</i>

42
00:03:19,048 --> 00:03:21,914
and pretty consistently
knocking them for six.

43
00:03:24,687 --> 00:03:26,677
<i>I'd say they're nearly
out of the game.</i>

44
00:03:34,362 --> 00:03:38,128
... law-abiding citizens to
have to subsidize criminals?

45
00:03:38,234 --> 00:03:42,466
But, Mr. Helpmann, the bombing
campaign is now in its 13th year.

46
00:03:42,572 --> 00:03:44,801
Beginner's luck.

47
00:03:45,841 --> 00:03:47,776
Thank you very much,
Deputy Minister.

48
00:03:47,944 --> 00:03:49,877
Thank you, David.

49
00:03:49,978 --> 00:03:52,742
And a very merry
Christmas to you all.

50
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,341
<i>"Scrooge was better
than his word.</i>

51
00:03:57,453 --> 00:04:00,580
<i>"He did it all, and
infinitely more.</i>

52
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:03,716
<i>"And to Tiny Tim,
who did not die...</i>

53
00:04:03,825 --> 00:04:06,818
"he became a second father.

54
00:04:06,929 --> 00:04:11,331
"He became as good a friend
in the good old world.

55
00:04:11,433 --> 00:04:14,733
"And so, as Tiny Tim observed...

56
00:04:14,836 --> 00:04:18,170
God bless us, every one."

57
00:04:21,576 --> 00:04:23,976
-Are you boys giving me the runaround?
-Where are you?

58
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:27,276
<i>Step right up. This way.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!</i>

59
00:04:27,382 --> 00:04:29,442
<i>Don't throw that. That's
only for long distance.</i>

60
00:04:29,552 --> 00:04:31,451
<i>All right.</i>

61
00:04:31,553 --> 00:04:33,461
<i>I'm sorry, boys, but we
haven't got any vacancies.</i>

62
00:04:33,485 --> 00:04:34,307
<i>Got no vacancies.</i>

63
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:36,915
<i>-We got plenty of rooms.
-That's all right. We take a room.</i>

64
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,959
<i>-All right.
-All right. We take a vacancy.</i>

65
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,689
<i>Boy, take the gentlemen's baggage.</i>
...

66
00:04:47,769 --> 00:04:50,466
Who's there?

67
00:04:52,141 --> 00:04:54,439
Who is that?

68
00:04:54,543 --> 00:04:58,502
Father Christmas can't come
if we haven't got a chimney.

69
00:04:58,613 --> 00:05:01,014
You'll see.

70
00:05:17,966 --> 00:05:19,228
No!

71
00:05:23,471 --> 00:05:26,235
What's going on?

72
00:05:26,341 --> 00:05:28,502
No!

73
00:05:48,764 --> 00:05:52,632
I hereby inform you, under
powers entrusted to me...

74
00:05:52,735 --> 00:05:57,034
under section 47, paragraph 7 of
council order number 438476...

75
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:00,973
That Mr. Buttle, Archibald, residing at
412 North Tower, Shangrila Towers...

76
00:06:01,076 --> 00:06:04,045
has been invited to assist the Ministry
of Information with certain inquiries...

77
00:06:04,146 --> 00:06:06,706
and that he is liable to certain
financial obligations...

78
00:06:06,815 --> 00:06:12,014
as specified in council
order RB/CZ/907/X.

79
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,021
Sign here, please.

80
00:06:16,524 --> 00:06:18,925
Where are you taking him?

81
00:06:19,028 --> 00:06:21,689
There.

82
00:06:21,797 --> 00:06:25,096
Thank you. Same again, please.

83
00:06:25,201 --> 00:06:28,261
Just there. Press
harder his time.

84
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:31,737
-Good.
-What is this all about?

85
00:06:31,841 --> 00:06:35,401
That is your receipt for your husband.
Thank you.

86
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:37,637
And this is my receipt
for your receipt.

87
00:06:37,747 --> 00:06:39,942
<i>Mrs. Buttle, are you okay?</i>

88
00:06:43,252 --> 00:06:45,550
-Ho! Ho!
-We're Department of Works!

89
00:06:45,654 --> 00:06:48,487
<i>Department of Works up here!</i>

90
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:50,649
<i>Careful with those
bloody things.</i>

91
00:06:51,826 --> 00:06:53,761
Don't take any notice
of them, love.

92
00:06:53,862 --> 00:06:56,228
Don't touch me. Why don't you
just get the hell out of here.

93
00:06:56,331 --> 00:06:59,266
Don't you worry, love. We'll have
everything shipshape in a jiffy.

94
00:06:59,367 --> 00:07:01,103
That's it. Nothing
to worry about.

95
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,658
Right. It's Tuttle
downstairs who can worry, eh?

96
00:07:03,738 --> 00:07:06,970
Tuttle? His name's Buttle.
There must be some mistake.

97
00:07:07,076 --> 00:07:09,976
Mistake? We don't make mistakes.

98
00:07:11,213 --> 00:07:14,478
That's bloody typical.

99
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:17,074
They've gone back to
metric without telling us.

100
00:07:17,185 --> 00:07:19,518
Mrs. Buttle, are you all right?

101
00:07:19,622 --> 00:07:21,589
Yeah.

102
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,948
"Buttle."

103
00:08:56,351 --> 00:08:58,320
Buttle, Archibald.

104
00:08:58,419 --> 00:09:00,785
Ridiculous name.

105
00:09:04,659 --> 00:09:07,288
On the twenty...

106
00:09:07,395 --> 00:09:09,830
Oh, shit.

107
00:09:09,932 --> 00:09:12,832
Mr...

108
00:09:15,037 --> 00:09:17,732
Mr. Lowry, would you
step in here, please?

109
00:09:50,706 --> 00:09:52,639
Ah.

110
00:09:53,842 --> 00:09:56,778
I say, h-has anybody seen Lowry?

111
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:04,312
Has anybody seen Sam Lowry?

112
00:10:39,554 --> 00:10:42,182
Sam.

113
00:10:49,063 --> 00:10:50,963
Sam.

114
00:11:18,192 --> 00:11:20,524
-Hello.
-Hello? Sam. Where are you?

115
00:11:20,629 --> 00:11:22,789
-Hello?
-It's 11:00.

116
00:11:22,898 --> 00:11:25,024
-What?
-11:00!

117
00:11:25,134 --> 00:11:27,466
-Mr. Kurtzmann.
-Yes.

118
00:11:27,568 --> 00:11:30,163
You're up late.

119
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,501
-It's 11:00.
-Is it?

120
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:39,505
Oh. The electrics here
are up the spout.

121
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,913
-I know. Look...
-Oh, yours too?

122
00:11:42,017 --> 00:11:42,875
Yes.

123
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,476
Oh, well, um, I'll be
there as soon as I can.

124
00:11:45,553 --> 00:11:47,453
-Yes. Thanks. Bye.
-Hurry up.

125
00:12:02,403 --> 00:12:04,599
<i>Hello, Sammy.</i>

126
00:12:04,706 --> 00:12:07,038
<i>What have you got to say?</i>
...

127
00:12:27,261 --> 00:12:30,095
<i>Oh, very good, Sammy.</i>

128
00:12:45,114 --> 00:12:49,607
<i>... famous statue pairing
truth and freedom.</i>

129
00:12:49,717 --> 00:12:52,653
This is not the only statue...
Shut up!

130
00:12:52,754 --> 00:12:55,279
<i>What's this gun for?</i>

131
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:58,918
This one, Sister, is a
nine-millimeter submachine gun...

132
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,326
<i>used for close-quarter
combat fighting.</i>

133
00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:03,693
<i>Very effective weapon.
Would you like to see it?</i>

134
00:13:34,562 --> 00:13:36,530
<i>Sam!</i>

135
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:40,057
Jack!

136
00:13:40,168 --> 00:13:42,831
-Well...
-Long time no see.

137
00:13:42,937 --> 00:13:45,462
-Hey.
-What are you doing here?

138
00:13:45,573 --> 00:13:48,303
I don't expect to see you
slumming it in Records.

139
00:13:48,409 --> 00:13:49,299
What's the problem?

140
00:13:49,325 --> 00:13:51,995
Problem? No problem. Everything's fine.
Wonderful. Marvelous.

141
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,139
<i>Alison's in great shape.
Kids are fine.</i>

142
00:13:54,249 --> 00:13:57,809
<i>I'm on Security Level 5 now, so
Mr. Helpmann relies on me more and more.</i>

143
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:00,548
-It's been a great year.
-You sound worried.

144
00:14:00,655 --> 00:14:03,682
Worried? Me? If I'm worried
about anyone, Sam, it's you.

145
00:14:03,792 --> 00:14:07,091
<i>I mean, look at you, Sam.
Whatever happened to you?</i>

146
00:14:07,196 --> 00:14:08,993
Records?

147
00:14:09,097 --> 00:14:10,860
<i>Sam, you were one
of the brightest...</i>

148
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,774
Sam?

149
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,878
Uh, Jack, it's great to see you.

150
00:14:26,981 --> 00:14:29,109
-I'm gonna be late.
-Sam.

151
00:14:29,217 --> 00:14:32,051
Let a friend tell you.
Your life is going wrong.

152
00:14:32,153 --> 00:14:35,088
Records is a dead-end department.
No security level worth a damn.

153
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:37,556
-It's impossible to get noticed.
-I know.

154
00:14:37,658 --> 00:14:40,219
Wonderful. Marvelous.

155
00:14:40,328 --> 00:14:42,558
Perfect. See you, Jack.

156
00:14:42,663 --> 00:14:45,394
-Give my regards to Alison and the twins.
-Triplets.

157
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,937
Triplets? God. How time flies.

158
00:14:50,938 --> 00:14:54,807
A very clear delineation of picture
this has. Adamant, mobile.

159
00:14:54,909 --> 00:14:56,878
Next.

160
00:15:00,883 --> 00:15:03,215
<i>I want to report a
wrongful arrest.</i>

161
00:15:04,385 --> 00:15:07,548
You want Information Adjustments.
Different department.

162
00:15:07,655 --> 00:15:09,556
I've been to Information
Adjustments.

163
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:12,751
They sent me here. They said you
have a form I need to fill out.

164
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,056
Have you got an arrest receipt?

165
00:15:15,163 --> 00:15:17,927
Yeah.

166
00:15:18,033 --> 00:15:21,628
-Is it stamped?
-Stamped?

167
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:26,698
No, no. There's no
stamp on it, you see.

168
00:15:26,807 --> 00:15:30,038
I can't let you have the
form until this is stamped.

169
00:15:30,144 --> 00:15:34,479
-Where do I get it stamped?
-Information Adjustments.

170
00:15:46,227 --> 00:15:48,024
It's nothing. It's nothing.

171
00:15:50,966 --> 00:15:53,092
<i>It keeps picking up old films.</i>

172
00:15:53,201 --> 00:15:55,260
That can't be right, can it?

173
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,428
Perhaps the machine's
on the blink.

174
00:15:57,538 --> 00:16:00,940
No, it's not the machine. There's a
mismatch on the personnel code numbers.

175
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:05,706
Tuttle should have had Ł31.06 debited
against his account, not Buttle.

176
00:16:05,813 --> 00:16:08,942
-My God! A mistake!
-Well, at least it's not ours.

177
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,019
Isn't it? Whose is it?

178
00:16:11,119 --> 00:16:13,780
-Information Retrieval.
-Oh, good.

179
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:16,448
Yeah. See, Expediting has put
in for electrical procedures...

180
00:16:16,557 --> 00:16:20,119
in respect of Buttle, Archibald,
shoe repair operative...

181
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:24,359
but Security has invoiced Admin for
Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer.

182
00:16:24,466 --> 00:16:26,990
Oh, what a relief.
Finish your tea, Sam.

183
00:16:27,101 --> 00:16:29,592
What? Oh. Thanks.

184
00:16:30,972 --> 00:16:34,169
I don't know what I would do
if you ever got promoted.

185
00:16:34,275 --> 00:16:37,734
-Oh, God, don't worry about that.
-No, but if they did promote you, uh...

186
00:16:39,715 --> 00:16:42,149
I've told you before.
I'd turn it down.

187
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,184
-Would you? Really?
-Really.

188
00:16:44,286 --> 00:16:46,754
You've been promoted.

189
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,985
It's your mother, isn't it?
Pulling strings again.

190
00:16:59,234 --> 00:17:03,432
Sam, it's time for you to grow
up and accept responsibility.

191
00:17:03,538 --> 00:17:08,167
Your poor father would be appalled
at your lack of promotion. Ooh!

192
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:11,872
Mother, I just wish you
would stop interfering.

193
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,244
I don't want promotion.
I'm happy where I am.

194
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:18,750
No, you're not. Jack
Lint is a lesson to you.

195
00:17:18,854 --> 00:17:21,981
He doesn't have your brains,
but he's got the ambition.

196
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:24,080
You haven't got the ambition.

197
00:17:24,192 --> 00:17:27,058
<i>Luckily, you've got me
and the deputy minister.</i>

198
00:17:27,162 --> 00:17:29,122
Mr. Helpmann was very
close to your father.

199
00:17:29,146 --> 00:17:30,348
Now, please, Mrs. Lowry.

200
00:17:30,432 --> 00:17:32,525
Don't get upset.

201
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:35,125
Mr. Lowry, please wait in reception.
You're giving her wrinkles.

202
00:17:35,237 --> 00:17:37,136
-You see?
-God!

203
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:39,866
Just try and relax, Mrs. Lowry.

204
00:17:39,974 --> 00:17:41,875
I'll make you 20 years younger.

205
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:45,309
-Ha!
-Yoo-hoo, Dr. Jaffe. You are a genius.

206
00:17:45,413 --> 00:17:47,939
Would you like to
be surgeon general?

207
00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:50,483
I know simply everybody.

208
00:17:50,585 --> 00:17:53,576
Well, they won't know you
when I've finished with you.

209
00:17:53,689 --> 00:17:56,714
First...

210
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,986
we remove the excess derma.

211
00:17:59,094 --> 00:18:00,993
So.

212
00:18:01,096 --> 00:18:06,260
Now the flaccid tissues under
the eyes and the forehead.

213
00:18:06,367 --> 00:18:08,096
-Zip.
-Oh.

214
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:13,337
Now, I lift...

215
00:18:13,442 --> 00:18:15,740
the wrinkles and
the worry lines...

216
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:18,335
right up into the wig,
into the hairline.

217
00:18:20,449 --> 00:18:22,279
<i>Now the template.</i>

218
00:18:24,219 --> 00:18:26,949
-Mercy.
-There. Now a bit of sticky.

219
00:18:27,055 --> 00:18:28,954
Like so.

220
00:18:29,057 --> 00:18:32,924
And already she's twice as beautiful
as she was before. Voilŕ!

221
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:38,124
<i>Mr. Helpmann was very close
to your poor father.</i>

222
00:18:38,232 --> 00:18:40,166
He was very close to me.

223
00:18:40,268 --> 00:18:42,167
Still is.

224
00:18:43,204 --> 00:18:46,197
He'll take you under his wing when
you get to Information Retrieval.

225
00:18:46,307 --> 00:18:49,573
-Thank you, sir.
-You'll like it there.

226
00:18:49,677 --> 00:18:51,805
<i>You're not listening
to me, Mother.</i>

227
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:58,209
<i>What the hell is this, lady?</i>

228
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:02,086
It's a present for my son.
Really!

229
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:05,647
I hope you like it.
It's very exclusive.

230
00:19:06,862 --> 00:19:08,761
What on earth is it?

231
00:19:08,864 --> 00:19:12,823
Something for an executive.

232
00:19:13,969 --> 00:19:16,528
Ah, Madame Lowry.

233
00:19:16,637 --> 00:19:19,334
You look exquisite today.
Merry Christmas.

234
00:19:19,441 --> 00:19:21,875
Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.

235
00:19:21,977 --> 00:19:24,411
-Sorry.
-Uh, you remember my son, Samuel.

236
00:19:24,512 --> 00:19:27,209
-Of course.
-We're joining Mrs. Terrain.

237
00:19:27,315 --> 00:19:30,715
-Yes. The lady's waiting.
-Are we? God.

238
00:19:32,287 --> 00:19:34,846
This way.

239
00:19:34,955 --> 00:19:38,049
Mother. Mother, I thought we
were going to be able to talk.

240
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,219
-We will. We will.
<i>-Ida, Sam.</i>

241
00:19:40,327 --> 00:19:42,375
<i>Oh, God. She's got
what's her name with her.</i>

242
00:19:42,401 --> 00:19:43,083
<i>Yoo-hoo!</i>

243
00:19:43,164 --> 00:19:45,394
Sam!

244
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:50,300
Well, Alma. How are you?
You look wonderful.

245
00:19:50,404 --> 00:19:53,169
Hello, Shirley.

246
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,766
Thank you, Spiro.

247
00:19:55,876 --> 00:19:57,970
-Salt?
-Not yet.

248
00:19:58,078 --> 00:20:00,444
Sam, happy Christmas.

249
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,576
<i>-So sorry we're late.</i>
-Thanks.

250
00:20:04,685 --> 00:20:07,119
<i>Now, Alma...</i>

251
00:20:07,221 --> 00:20:09,190
what are you going to have?

252
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:13,057
I can't make up my mind whether to
have the number one or the number two.

253
00:20:13,161 --> 00:20:16,493
-What do you recommend, Spiro?
-Between you and me, madame...

254
00:20:16,597 --> 00:20:18,498
today the number two.

255
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:22,000
Thank you, Spiro. Shirley. Shirley,
what are you going to have?

256
00:20:22,103 --> 00:20:26,335
Between you and me, mademoiselle,
today the number one.

257
00:20:26,441 --> 00:20:30,308
-Madame Lowry?
-Oh, to hell with the diet.

258
00:20:30,412 --> 00:20:32,573
I'm going to have a
number eight, please.

259
00:20:32,681 --> 00:20:35,275
A most perceptive choice
if I dare say so, madame.

260
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:36,163
Oh, Ida!

261
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,151
-Monsieur.
-Steak, please. Rare. Mother...

262
00:20:38,252 --> 00:20:39,247
-Monsieur, quel numero?

263
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:41,302
-I don't know which number.
Mother, please...

264
00:20:41,388 --> 00:20:43,755
-That one. There.
-That's fine. Thanks.

265
00:20:43,858 --> 00:20:46,588
-Mother, will you please listen to me.
-Alma! You wicked girl.

266
00:20:46,694 --> 00:20:49,788
-You've started your treatment.
-Say the number, please.

267
00:20:49,897 --> 00:20:53,197
-You noticed.
-You have to say the number!

268
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,944
Will you please go away!
I'm trying to talk...

269
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,088
I must tell you all about it.

270
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:58,138
Number three.

271
00:20:59,374 --> 00:21:01,342
Mother, will you listen to me.
I haven't...

272
00:21:01,442 --> 00:21:03,569
<i>Numero huit.</i>

273
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:08,944
Braised veal in wine sauce.

274
00:21:11,051 --> 00:21:16,148
It's too exciting. I've left
Dr. Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman.

275
00:21:16,258 --> 00:21:18,885
-Numero deux. Duck a l'orange.
-Dr. Chapman? Chapman?

276
00:21:18,993 --> 00:21:20,894
Excusez-moi.

277
00:21:20,996 --> 00:21:23,395
The acid man?

278
00:21:23,498 --> 00:21:26,898
Really, Ida! Just because his
techniques are revolutionary...

279
00:21:27,001 --> 00:21:30,232
I don't go around calling
Dr. Jaffe the knife man.

280
00:21:30,337 --> 00:21:32,897
<i>Numero un, crevettes
a la mayonnaise.</i>

281
00:21:33,008 --> 00:21:35,179
I am sorry, Alma. I didn't
mean to sound so...

282
00:21:35,203 --> 00:21:36,865
It's all right, Ida.
It's just...

283
00:21:36,944 --> 00:21:40,881
<i>Steak. Numéro trois.</i>

284
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:45,215
<i>Mesdames, monsieur...</i>

285
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:47,345
<i>Bon appetit!</i>

286
00:21:47,454 --> 00:21:49,650
<i>-Merci.
-Merci.</i>

287
00:21:49,758 --> 00:21:54,092
Acid, on the other hand, can be used
for such wonderfully subtle shading.

288
00:21:54,194 --> 00:21:56,185
Such delicate nuances.

289
00:21:56,298 --> 00:21:58,528
Like a Rembrandt etching.

290
00:21:58,633 --> 00:22:01,067
-And it is so much quicker.
-God!

291
00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:03,030
If it wasn't for this complication...
the doctor

292
00:22:03,056 --> 00:22:04,651
says it could have
happened to anybody...

293
00:22:04,739 --> 00:22:06,638
I'd have had this
dressing off yesterday.

294
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:09,073
Shirley.

295
00:22:10,278 --> 00:22:13,008
Salt?

296
00:22:34,669 --> 00:22:36,568
What were we saying?

297
00:22:36,671 --> 00:22:39,970
-This isn't rare.
-Oh! By the by, Alma...

298
00:22:40,075 --> 00:22:43,806
I saw the most wonderful idea for
Christmas presents at the chemist's.

299
00:22:43,912 --> 00:22:46,744
Gift tokens. Medical
gift tokens.

300
00:22:46,847 --> 00:22:48,748
Oh, that sounds marvelous!

301
00:22:48,849 --> 00:22:52,286
It's good at any doctor's and
most of the major hospitals.

302
00:22:52,386 --> 00:22:55,913
It's also accepted for
gynecological examinations...

303
00:22:56,023 --> 00:22:58,423
<i>including cesarean section.</i>

304
00:22:58,526 --> 00:22:59,209
Spiro.

305
00:22:59,233 --> 00:23:01,280
I'm sorry, madame.
I don't know what to say.

306
00:23:01,363 --> 00:23:03,330
It never really happens to us.

307
00:23:03,431 --> 00:23:05,625
I'm going to do something
about it straightaway.

308
00:23:05,733 --> 00:23:09,431
Really, Sam! Why can't you do
something about these terrorists?

309
00:23:09,537 --> 00:23:12,563
It's my lunch hour.

310
00:23:12,673 --> 00:23:14,732
Besides, it's not my department.

311
00:23:14,843 --> 00:23:19,404
Actually, Alma, that was one of the little
things I've been dying to tell you.

312
00:23:19,513 --> 00:23:24,644
Look. Sam's been promoted
to Information Retrieval.

313
00:23:24,752 --> 00:23:28,654
Oh, that's wonderful!
Congratulations, Sam!

314
00:23:28,757 --> 00:23:32,488
Stop it! I'm not being promoted. I'm
not going to Information Retrieval.

315
00:23:32,594 --> 00:23:36,222
If I want you to stick your oar in,
Mother, I'll tell you where to stick it.

316
00:23:40,268 --> 00:23:42,236
Pepper?

317
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,771
I've gotta go.

318
00:23:45,874 --> 00:23:48,672
-Sam, you haven't had your dessert.
-I don't want dessert.

319
00:23:48,777 --> 00:23:50,799
I don't want promotion.
I don't want anything.

320
00:23:50,825 --> 00:23:52,201
Of course you want something.

321
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:55,113
You must have hopes,
wishes, dreams!

322
00:23:55,215 --> 00:23:57,582
No, nothing. Not even dreams.

323
00:24:08,128 --> 00:24:10,256
Sam.

324
00:24:42,262 --> 00:24:43,230
Sam!

325
00:25:23,304 --> 00:25:26,467
Oh, God.

326
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:51,628
Hello. Central Services?

327
00:25:51,732 --> 00:25:54,792
I'm at 579B, Block 19,
Northwestern Section "D."

328
00:25:54,903 --> 00:25:58,134
That's exit one on Green Pastures
Highway at the Orange Blossom Flyover.

329
00:25:58,239 --> 00:26:01,730
And I've got trouble with my
air-conditioning. It's an emergency.

330
00:26:01,843 --> 00:26:03,742
Thank you for calling
Central Services.

331
00:26:03,845 --> 00:26:05,744
I'm sorry. Due to temporary
staff shortage...

332
00:26:05,846 --> 00:26:10,546
Central Services cannot take service calls
centrally between 2300 and 0900 hours.

333
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:13,048
Have a nice day. This has
not been a recording.

334
00:26:13,074 --> 00:26:14,270
This is an emergency.

335
00:26:14,355 --> 00:26:16,653
Thank you for calling Central Services.
I'm sorry. Due to...

336
00:26:16,758 --> 00:26:19,989
-No. I've got to have a heating engineer.
-Thank you for calling Central Services.

337
00:26:20,094 --> 00:26:21,993
Oh, shit.

338
00:26:46,621 --> 00:26:48,520
Hello.

339
00:26:57,832 --> 00:26:59,959
-Hello.
-Hello.

340
00:27:01,001 --> 00:27:03,402
-Hello.
-Hello.

341
00:27:05,506 --> 00:27:07,598
-Hello.
-Hello.

342
00:27:09,042 --> 00:27:10,942
Hello. Mr. Lowry.

343
00:27:11,045 --> 00:27:13,012
Yes. Who is this?

344
00:27:13,114 --> 00:27:16,549
Put the phone down and
raise your hands.

345
00:27:16,651 --> 00:27:18,618
What? Who is this?

346
00:27:22,123 --> 00:27:24,090
Nice and easy now.

347
00:27:24,192 --> 00:27:26,160
Nice and easy.

348
00:27:30,265 --> 00:27:32,893
Just keep your hands
where I can see them.

349
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:59,356
What... What are you doing?

350
00:28:04,565 --> 00:28:06,795
Harry Tuttle. Heating
engineer at your service.

351
00:28:11,471 --> 00:28:13,997
Tuttle?

352
00:28:14,107 --> 00:28:16,008
Are you from Central Services?

353
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,884
I called Central Services.

354
00:28:23,984 --> 00:28:26,419
Well, they're a little
overworked these days.

355
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,682
Luckily I intercepted your call.

356
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:31,554
You did...

357
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:35,924
<i>Just a minute. What was
that business with the gun?</i>

358
00:28:36,029 --> 00:28:37,963
It's just a precaution, sir.

359
00:28:38,066 --> 00:28:39,965
Just a precaution.

360
00:28:40,067 --> 00:28:43,002
I've had traps set
for me before now.

361
00:28:43,104 --> 00:28:45,595
And there are plenty of
people in Central Services...

362
00:28:45,707 --> 00:28:47,867
who'd love to get their
hands on Harry Tuttle.

363
00:28:50,111 --> 00:28:52,306
Are you telling me
that this is illegal?

364
00:28:58,885 --> 00:29:00,904
Well, yes and no. Officially,
only Central Service

365
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:02,710
operatives are supposed
to touch this stuff.

366
00:29:02,789 --> 00:29:04,690
-Would you hold this, please?
-Uh...

367
00:29:04,791 --> 00:29:07,089
But nowadays, with all the
new rules and regulations...

368
00:29:07,194 --> 00:29:09,163
they can't get decent
staff anymore.

369
00:29:09,262 --> 00:29:12,163
So they tend to turn a blind
eye as long as I'm careful.

370
00:29:12,266 --> 00:29:15,565
Mind you, if ever they could prove that
I've been working on their equipment...

371
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,900
well, that's a pipe
of a different color.

372
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,804
-Wouldn't it be simpler just to work...
-Would you hold this for me?

373
00:29:20,907 --> 00:29:24,344
Sorry. Yes. I was saying, wouldn't it be
simpler to work with Central Services?

374
00:29:24,444 --> 00:29:26,935
Nah! Nah. Couldn't
stand the pa...

375
00:29:27,048 --> 00:29:29,778
We're getting warm.

376
00:29:29,884 --> 00:29:31,586
You couldn't what?
Couldn't stand the what?

377
00:29:31,612 --> 00:29:33,275
Paperwork. Couldn't
stand the paperwork.

378
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:36,721
Listen. This whole system of
yours could be on fire...

379
00:29:36,824 --> 00:29:40,988
and I couldn't even turn on a kitchen
tap without filling out a 27 B/6.

380
00:29:41,095 --> 00:29:43,790
Bloody paperwork.

381
00:29:43,897 --> 00:29:46,093
I suppose one has to
expect a certain amount.

382
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,169
Why? I came into this game for
the action, the excitement.

383
00:29:49,269 --> 00:29:54,401
Go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out,
wherever there's trouble, a man alone.

384
00:29:54,509 --> 00:29:58,444
Now they got the whole country sectioned
off. You can't make a move without a form.

385
00:30:14,127 --> 00:30:16,061
Found it.

386
00:30:16,163 --> 00:30:18,064
There's your problem.

387
00:30:18,165 --> 00:30:20,099
-Can you fix it?
-No, I can't.

388
00:30:20,201 --> 00:30:23,897
But I can bypass it
with one of these.

389
00:30:26,173 --> 00:30:28,142
Fine by me.

390
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,347
-Are you expecting anyone?
-No.

391
00:30:39,019 --> 00:30:42,250
-Get down!
-Wait! Wait! Will you wait!

392
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:45,259
Shh.

393
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:51,557
The flashlight.

394
00:30:53,534 --> 00:30:55,433
Central Services.

395
00:30:55,536 --> 00:30:57,435
-Central Services.
-Oh, yes.

396
00:30:57,538 --> 00:30:59,438
-You rang, sir?
-You rang, sir?

397
00:30:59,539 --> 00:31:01,837
-Trouble with your air-conditioning?
-Air-conditioning, sir?

398
00:31:01,942 --> 00:31:04,275
No, it's... it's...
it's, uh, all right.

399
00:31:04,377 --> 00:31:07,438
It's, um... It's fixed.

400
00:31:07,548 --> 00:31:09,242
-Fixed.
-Fixed?

401
00:31:09,349 --> 00:31:11,250
Yes, um...

402
00:31:11,352 --> 00:31:13,547
I mean, it, um, fixed itself.

403
00:31:13,653 --> 00:31:16,213
-Oh, it fixed itself!
-Fixed itself?

404
00:31:16,324 --> 00:31:18,519
Yes!

405
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:20,526
Machines don't fix themselves.

406
00:31:20,627 --> 00:31:22,823
No, they don't fix
themselves, sir.

407
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:26,330
-He's tampered with it, Dowser.
-I think he's tampered with it, Mr. Spoor.

408
00:31:26,433 --> 00:31:28,334
Sorry you've had a
wasted journey.

409
00:31:28,435 --> 00:31:30,336
Oh, that's all right.

410
00:31:30,438 --> 00:31:32,905
-I think we'll go have a little look.
-No, you can't.

411
00:31:33,007 --> 00:31:35,270
I think we should.
Yes, Mr. Spoor.

412
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:37,708
Have you got a 27 B/6?

413
00:31:37,811 --> 00:31:40,302
27 B/6?

414
00:31:40,413 --> 00:31:42,314
27 B/6?

415
00:31:42,415 --> 00:31:44,748
<i>27...</i>

416
00:31:46,753 --> 00:31:48,653
Now look what
you've done to him!

417
00:31:48,756 --> 00:31:52,782
Well, have you got a 27 B/6?

418
00:31:52,894 --> 00:31:55,657
Not... as such.

419
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,931
But we'll get one.

420
00:31:59,032 --> 00:32:01,278
It's all right. It's all right.
It's all right.

421
00:32:01,303 --> 00:32:02,423
It's all right, then?

422
00:32:02,502 --> 00:32:05,836
Sorry. I'm a bit of a stickler
for paperwork, you see.

423
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:09,000
I mean, where would we be if we didn't
stick to the correct procedures?

424
00:32:09,109 --> 00:32:11,509
We'll be back.

425
00:32:11,612 --> 00:32:13,671
We'll be back!

426
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:18,279
It's all right.

427
00:32:18,385 --> 00:32:20,286
Thanks for coming.

428
00:32:20,387 --> 00:32:22,288
We'll be back, you
clever little bastard!

429
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:24,914
<i>-Thank you.
-We'll show you!</i>

430
00:32:31,596 --> 00:32:32,424
Well...

431
00:32:32,432 --> 00:32:35,433
Thanks, Lowry. You're a
good man in a tight corner.

432
00:32:35,435 --> 00:32:37,461
Thanks.

433
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,732
Listen, um... I, uh...

434
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:45,438
Well, I...

435
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:47,844
I just happen to work at the
Ministry of Information.

436
00:32:47,949 --> 00:32:50,440
-What?
-And, uh...

437
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:55,113
Well, I just happen to know
that Information Retrieval...

438
00:32:55,222 --> 00:32:58,852
are looking for an Archibald
Tuttle, heating engineer.

439
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,794
You, uh...

440
00:33:01,895 --> 00:33:04,193
You wouldn't, by any chance...

441
00:33:04,298 --> 00:33:05,992
Would you?

442
00:33:07,234 --> 00:33:09,999
My good friends call me Harry.

443
00:33:11,305 --> 00:33:13,967
Information Retrieval, huh?

444
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:16,406
The big boys.

445
00:33:21,182 --> 00:33:23,082
What do they want you for?

446
00:33:27,622 --> 00:33:30,089
-Time to go.
-Sorry.

447
00:33:30,191 --> 00:33:32,659
How's that?

448
00:33:35,695 --> 00:33:38,664
Listen, you, um... you really
must let me give you something.

449
00:33:44,271 --> 00:33:47,605
How much will it be for the, uh...
for the work?

450
00:33:47,708 --> 00:33:49,607
Ah, come on.

451
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:52,679
You did me a favor. Just
check the corridor.

452
00:33:54,015 --> 00:33:56,915
Oh. Well, thanks.

453
00:33:57,018 --> 00:33:59,919
Listen, kid, we're
all in it together.

454
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,318
-Go on.
-Right.

455
00:34:07,827 --> 00:34:10,626
Okay.

456
00:34:15,302 --> 00:34:17,271
All clear.

457
00:34:45,365 --> 00:34:47,960
I think Kurtzmann is
getting suspicious.

458
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:53,400
What's playing today?

459
00:34:53,507 --> 00:34:55,407
<i>Casablanca.</i>

460
00:34:55,509 --> 00:34:58,478
<i>Mr. Lowry, will you
step in here, please.</i>

461
00:35:01,548 --> 00:35:03,516
<i>Lowry!</i>

462
00:35:05,085 --> 00:35:07,577
<i>Sam Lowry!</i>

463
00:35:14,728 --> 00:35:16,697
Psst!

464
00:35:19,099 --> 00:35:22,228
Thank God you're here.
We're in terrible trouble.

465
00:35:22,335 --> 00:35:23,963
Shh.

466
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:33,440
-Look at this. Look at this.
-It's a check.

467
00:35:33,547 --> 00:35:35,447
It's the refund for Tuttle.

468
00:35:35,548 --> 00:35:37,449
-Tuttle?
-Mm-hmm.

469
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:40,452
No, no. Buttle. I mean Buttle.

470
00:35:40,554 --> 00:35:42,748
It's been confusion
from the word go.

471
00:35:42,856 --> 00:35:45,757
He's been overcharged for
Information Retrieval procedures...

472
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:48,760
and someone somewhere is trying
to make us carry the can.

473
00:35:48,862 --> 00:35:52,298
Can I have a look? I've never
seen a refund check before.

474
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,367
I'll bet it's Jeffries.

475
00:35:56,469 --> 00:35:58,369
Yes.

476
00:35:58,472 --> 00:36:01,373
He always believes that people should
pay more for their interrogation.

477
00:36:01,474 --> 00:36:03,375
And "B," he loathes me.

478
00:36:03,476 --> 00:36:05,376
We've gotta get rid of it!

479
00:36:05,478 --> 00:36:07,378
Well, send it to somebody else.

480
00:36:07,481 --> 00:36:10,382
Better still, send it to Buttle.
After all, it's his check.

481
00:36:10,483 --> 00:36:12,884
I've tried that. But look.
Look at this.

482
00:36:12,987 --> 00:36:16,945
You see? The population census has
gotten him down as "dormanted."

483
00:36:17,056 --> 00:36:20,458
Uh, the Central Collective Storehouse
computer has got him down as "deleted."

484
00:36:20,561 --> 00:36:21,661
Hang on.

485
00:36:21,663 --> 00:36:24,262
Information Retrieval has got
him down as "inoperative."

486
00:36:24,565 --> 00:36:27,032
There's another one: Security
has got him down as "excised."

487
00:36:27,134 --> 00:36:29,181
<i>-Administration has him
down as "completed."</i>

488
00:36:29,206 --> 00:36:29,889
<i>-He's dead.</i>

489
00:36:29,969 --> 00:36:31,960
Le...

490
00:36:32,072 --> 00:36:34,039
Dead?

491
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:38,240
Well, that's awful.

492
00:36:42,148 --> 00:36:44,708
We'll never get rid of
the damn thing now.

493
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:48,050
What we gonna do, Sam?

494
00:36:48,155 --> 00:36:50,054
Could try next of kin.

495
00:36:50,157 --> 00:36:52,056
Next of kin!

496
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:54,650
Yes!

497
00:36:57,965 --> 00:37:00,762
There we go. Buttle.
Veronica. Mrs.

498
00:37:00,867 --> 00:37:02,768
Veronica?

499
00:37:02,869 --> 00:37:04,769
What's the number on the check?

500
00:37:04,871 --> 00:37:08,568
Uh, 27156789...

501
00:37:10,677 --> 00:37:14,909
/074328K.

502
00:37:17,384 --> 00:37:19,351
Right. Into memory.

503
00:37:20,788 --> 00:37:22,755
Central Banking.

504
00:37:23,958 --> 00:37:26,425
Veronica Buttle.

505
00:37:26,527 --> 00:37:28,427
Mrs.

506
00:37:28,528 --> 00:37:30,496
Deposit.

507
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,246
Thank God for that.

508
00:37:47,347 --> 00:37:49,248
Uh, would you like some tea?

509
00:37:59,425 --> 00:38:03,021
There's a problem. She
doesn't have a bank account.

510
00:38:07,534 --> 00:38:09,503
Well, that's it, then.

511
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:13,438
I might just as well go
and hang myself now.

512
00:38:16,409 --> 00:38:17,416
This sort of thing could
never have happened

513
00:38:17,442 --> 00:38:20,496
before this stupid
seventh-tier reorganization.

514
00:38:21,081 --> 00:38:25,210
That's Simmons's doing. And he and
Jeffries always sit together at lunch.

515
00:38:25,318 --> 00:38:27,014
Bastards!

516
00:38:27,121 --> 00:38:29,088
Sh... Shh. Shh.

517
00:38:32,826 --> 00:38:35,489
Perhaps we could lose
the thing behind a filing

518
00:38:35,514 --> 00:38:37,786
cabinet or something...
burn it, eat it.

519
00:38:37,864 --> 00:38:39,764
Look, there is one solution.

520
00:38:39,867 --> 00:38:41,766
<i>What?</i>

521
00:38:41,869 --> 00:38:44,166
Drive out to Mrs. Buttle, let
her sign the back of the check.

522
00:38:44,271 --> 00:38:47,364
She can cash it at the
corner sweet shop.

523
00:38:48,541 --> 00:38:50,442
That's brilliant, Sam.

524
00:38:50,543 --> 00:38:52,443
I'll even do it for you.

525
00:38:52,545 --> 00:38:54,945
Here, authorize the check.
What's the address?

526
00:38:55,048 --> 00:38:56,516
Everything's in here.

527
00:38:57,684 --> 00:39:01,211
Uh, w-what should I do next?

528
00:39:03,923 --> 00:39:07,291
Pink and blue receipts. Sign
there, there and there.

529
00:39:07,393 --> 00:39:09,521
<i>-And sign the check there.
-Yes.</i>

530
00:39:14,668 --> 00:39:17,228
I think I've broken a bone.

531
00:39:17,338 --> 00:39:19,237
Look, my wrist is all limp.

532
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,739
What a pathetic creature I am!

533
00:39:21,842 --> 00:39:24,003
Here.

534
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:26,409
I'll do it for you.

535
00:39:43,998 --> 00:39:45,898
Right.

536
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,092
I'll be on my way.

537
00:39:49,802 --> 00:39:52,032
<i>Sam?</i>

538
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:56,233
You are good to me, you know.

539
00:39:56,242 --> 00:40:00,304
<i>-Here's looking at you, kid.</i>
-Here's looking at you.

540
00:40:04,217 --> 00:40:07,550
<i># Brazil #</i>

541
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:12,717

00:40:12,826 --> 00:40:18,764
<i># We stood

00:40:18,865 --> 00:40:20,507

00:40:20,532 --> 00:40:22,619

554
00:41:03,543 --> 00:41:06,445
Hello. I wonder if you
could tell me where the...

555
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:08,514
Piss off!

556
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:15,746
Hello.

557
00:41:15,856 --> 00:41:17,824
I'll never confess!

558
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:26,190
Hey, come on! You
gotta interrogate me!

559
00:41:52,391 --> 00:41:54,360
Mrs. Buttle?

560
00:41:56,663 --> 00:41:59,460
Uh, Mrs. Buttle?

561
00:42:07,074 --> 00:42:10,510
Ah. Um, are you Mrs. Buttle?

562
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,248
Um...

563
00:42:17,951 --> 00:42:20,442
my name's Lowry.

564
00:42:20,554 --> 00:42:22,954
Uh, Sam Lowry.

565
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:27,922
Um, I'm from the
Ministry of Information.

566
00:42:30,197 --> 00:42:33,496
I've come to give you a check.

567
00:42:38,605 --> 00:42:40,902
Um, it's a refund, actually.

568
00:42:41,007 --> 00:42:43,976
-There was a mistake.
-Mistake?

569
00:42:44,077 --> 00:42:45,976
Yes, yes. Not in my
department, of course.

570
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:47,978
I'm only Records.

571
00:42:48,081 --> 00:42:50,641
No, it, uh... I'll
tell you what it is.

572
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:54,481
It seems that Mr. Buttle was
overcharged by Information Retrieval.

573
00:42:55,722 --> 00:42:58,519
Yes, they don't usually
make mistakes, but, uh...

574
00:42:58,625 --> 00:43:01,025
well, I suppose we're all human.

575
00:43:04,264 --> 00:43:06,164
Oh!

576
00:43:06,266 --> 00:43:08,233
What happened to the, um...

577
00:43:12,572 --> 00:43:16,373
Actually, you know, my coming here is rather
unorthodox, bringing you this check...

578
00:43:16,476 --> 00:43:20,434
as any payments are normally made
through Central Computer, but, um...

579
00:43:20,547 --> 00:43:24,414
Well, as there were certain...
difficulties...

580
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:27,487
we thought, well, rather
than cause delay...

581
00:43:27,588 --> 00:43:29,818
we'd let you have it now.

582
00:43:29,922 --> 00:43:33,050
You know, it being
Christmas and all.

583
00:43:33,159 --> 00:43:35,788
My husband's dead, isn't he?

584
00:43:37,731 --> 00:43:41,632
Um, I do assure you, Mrs. Buttle,
the ministry is very scrupulous...

585
00:43:41,735 --> 00:43:44,568
about following up and
eradicating any error.

586
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:47,503
But if you do have any
complaints you wish to make...

587
00:43:47,608 --> 00:43:51,840
I'd be, well, only too happy to
send you the appropriate forms.

588
00:43:51,945 --> 00:43:54,413
What have you done
with his body?

589
00:43:57,050 --> 00:44:00,679
Oh! Gosh.

590
00:44:00,786 --> 00:44:03,688
Um, I-I don't know anything
about that, Mrs. Buttle.

591
00:44:03,789 --> 00:44:05,690
I'm really just
delivering the check.

592
00:44:05,791 --> 00:44:11,525
So, if, um... Look, if you wouldn't
mind just signing these two receipts...

593
00:44:11,632 --> 00:44:16,092
I'd be only too happy to, uh...
to leave you in peace.

594
00:44:16,202 --> 00:44:18,693
He hadn't done anything.

595
00:44:18,804 --> 00:44:20,704
He was good!

596
00:44:22,809 --> 00:44:26,835
What have you done
with his body?

597
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:36,250
It isn't being very
helpful, Mrs. Buttle.

598
00:44:42,996 --> 00:44:45,396
I didn't have to come here,
you know, Mrs. Buttle.

599
00:44:45,498 --> 00:44:48,400
I'll kill you!

600
00:44:48,501 --> 00:44:50,402
I'll kill you, you bastard!

601
00:44:58,844 --> 00:45:01,905
Hey!

602
00:45:02,014 --> 00:45:04,108
Get off!

603
00:45:04,217 --> 00:45:06,242
Are you all right?

604
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,588
Are you all right?

605
00:45:13,492 --> 00:45:16,461
<i>Mrs. Buttle, are you all right?</i>

606
00:45:16,563 --> 00:45:18,427
It's you!

607
00:45:18,532 --> 00:45:21,501
Wait! Stop! Don't go! Stop!

608
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:18,824
<i>Oh, look! He'll
never get that out!</i>

609
00:46:33,072 --> 00:46:36,702
Stop! I had nothing to do with it!
Wait!

610
00:46:36,809 --> 00:46:38,777
Stop!

611
00:46:43,083 --> 00:46:45,847
<i>He's coming back!</i>

612
00:46:54,594 --> 00:46:57,391
Jesus Christ!

613
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:00,793
Jesus...

614
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:04,132
-Go away.
-Her name's Jill.

615
00:47:04,237 --> 00:47:07,331
What? Jill?

616
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,376
Jill who? Jill who?

617
00:47:11,478 --> 00:47:12,876
Layton.

618
00:47:15,148 --> 00:47:17,547
Jill Layton.

619
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:21,018
You're a very good little girl.
What are you doing here?

620
00:47:21,121 --> 00:47:23,315
Waiting for my daddy.

621
00:47:23,422 --> 00:47:26,391
He will be pleased
when he gets home.

622
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:15,168
Sam, I've just had the
Transport Pool onto me.

623
00:48:15,275 --> 00:48:18,472
You don't anything about a personnel
transporter gone missing, do you?

624
00:48:18,577 --> 00:48:21,445
Personnel transporter? What?

625
00:48:21,547 --> 00:48:23,971
Oh, the prannets. I had
a personal transporter.

626
00:48:23,996 --> 00:48:24,802
<i>Huh.</i>

627
00:48:24,885 --> 00:48:26,784
I'll do the paperwork
in the morning.

628
00:48:26,887 --> 00:48:30,288
Um, is it all right
about Mrs. Tuttl...

629
00:48:30,389 --> 00:48:33,621
<i>Uh, Buttle's check?</i>

630
00:48:33,726 --> 00:48:35,626
-Uh-huh.
-Can I forget it?

631
00:48:35,728 --> 00:48:37,788
-Yeah.
-Oh, what a relief.

632
00:48:37,898 --> 00:48:40,161
I'm gonna have
nightmares, you know.

633
00:48:42,568 --> 00:48:46,061
-Oh, damn and blast!
-What's the matter?

634
00:48:47,875 --> 00:48:50,934
I don't suppose you'd happen to know
how I can get round an I RQ/3, do you?

635
00:48:51,344 --> 00:48:54,313
Ooh, all information on third-level
suspects is classified.

636
00:48:54,414 --> 00:48:56,494
All inquiries
through Information Retrieval,

637
00:48:56,518 --> 00:48:58,875
and that's hopeless. They
never tell you anything.

638
00:48:58,952 --> 00:49:02,284
Come the time they want
something from us, oh, yes.

639
00:49:02,389 --> 00:49:06,916
There is one way I could get round it.
I could accept my mother's promotion.

640
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:08,927
Yes.

641
00:49:09,028 --> 00:49:11,088
No!

642
00:49:11,197 --> 00:49:13,324
You can't. You've
just turned it down.

643
00:49:13,432 --> 00:49:15,594
I didn't sign the form.

644
00:49:16,735 --> 00:49:18,704
I did it for you.

645
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:22,670
-You didn't.
-I did.

646
00:49:22,775 --> 00:49:24,333
You didn't!

647
00:49:24,443 --> 00:49:26,605
I did!

648
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:28,340
What did you do that for?

649
00:49:28,447 --> 00:49:31,474
It's what you wanted, isn't it?

650
00:49:31,585 --> 00:49:34,349
Oh, I don't know.

651
00:49:34,454 --> 00:49:36,581
I don't know what I want.

652
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:40,659
Come on, before they
turn the lights out.

653
00:49:56,943 --> 00:49:58,842
<i>There is one way round it.</i>

654
00:49:58,945 --> 00:50:02,903
<i>I could always accept promotion
to Information Retrieval.</i>

655
00:50:42,489 --> 00:50:45,117
Sam!

656
00:51:55,027 --> 00:51:58,657
Oh, Christ.

657
00:52:21,454 --> 00:52:25,356
What are you doing? What...
My God! What's going on?

658
00:52:25,458 --> 00:52:28,688
-Emergency procedures.
-Emergency procedures!

659
00:52:28,795 --> 00:52:31,161
-I haven't got an emergency!
-Yeah?

660
00:52:31,264 --> 00:52:32,402
<i>This is an emergency!</i>

661
00:52:32,427 --> 00:52:35,190
<i>Have a nice day. This has
not been a recording...</i>

662
00:52:37,269 --> 00:52:39,898
Here. Sign that.

663
00:52:40,974 --> 00:52:43,771
-What is it?
-A 27 B/6.

664
00:52:43,876 --> 00:52:46,038
What do you think it is?
Where's he gone?

665
00:52:46,146 --> 00:52:48,739
<i>Spoor, come here! Look!
I got it! I found it!</i>

666
00:52:48,847 --> 00:52:51,817
Spoor! Spoor! Come here, Spoor!

667
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:55,547
It's a bypass valve on this...
on the transformer.

668
00:53:02,494 --> 00:53:04,394
Tuttle!

669
00:53:04,496 --> 00:53:06,795
Tuttle. It's Tuttle.

670
00:53:08,168 --> 00:53:10,260
You've had that scab
Tuttle here, ain't ya?

671
00:53:10,369 --> 00:53:13,065
What are you talking about?

672
00:53:13,172 --> 00:53:16,074
-Who fixed your ducts? Huh?
-Fixed your ducts, all right.

673
00:53:16,175 --> 00:53:18,235
I told you before...
they fixed themselves.

674
00:53:18,344 --> 00:53:21,244
Oh, yeah? Then where did
this come from, eh?

675
00:53:21,347 --> 00:53:24,009
Out of your nostril? Eh?

676
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:26,585
Nostrils, eh?

677
00:53:28,153 --> 00:53:30,121
Central Services.

678
00:53:32,458 --> 00:53:34,358
They don't take
kindly to sabotage.

679
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:37,918
Sabotage, huh?

680
00:53:39,264 --> 00:53:42,701
Jesus, this place is
in a terrible state.

681
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:45,737
<i>Just a minute! You're not gonna
leave it like this, are you?</i>

682
00:53:45,838 --> 00:53:49,605
Why not? All you gotta do is blow
your nose and it's fixed, innit?

683
00:53:49,708 --> 00:53:51,643
That's right!

684
00:53:51,744 --> 00:53:53,711
Well...

685
00:53:55,347 --> 00:53:57,338
Oh, my...

686
00:53:57,449 --> 00:53:59,418
Jesus!

687
00:54:29,282 --> 00:54:33,742
<i>What have you done
with his body?</i>

688
00:57:51,184 --> 00:57:54,516
 Mrs. Ida Lowry requests the
pleasure of your company

689
00:57:54,619 --> 00:57:56,554
 At her apartment tonight

690
00:57:56,655 --> 00:58:00,489
 From 8:30

691
00:58:00,592 --> 00:58:02,583
 To midnight

692
00:58:02,695 --> 00:58:04,925
 To celebrate the completion

693
00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:08,056
 Of her recent cosmetic

694
00:58:08,166 --> 00:58:10,135
Surgery

695
00:58:10,235 --> 00:58:17,835
 Telegram

696
00:58:27,085 --> 00:58:28,713
Um...

697
00:58:29,789 --> 00:58:31,688
Thanks.

698
00:58:31,791 --> 00:58:34,623
-It's reply paid.
-Is it?

699
00:58:34,726 --> 00:58:37,525
Oh. Um...

700
00:58:38,998 --> 00:58:40,898
Two, three...

701
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,900
 Mother, I'm sorry, but I'm
unable to come to your party

702
00:58:44,003 --> 00:58:46,699
-You don't have to sing it.
-I don't?

703
00:58:46,806 --> 00:58:48,706
No.

704
00:58:48,807 --> 00:58:51,275
Oh. Sorry.

705
00:58:54,413 --> 00:58:57,643
Aren't you a bit late? I mean,
the party started an hour ago.

706
00:58:57,750 --> 00:58:59,809
Yeah. It's the backlog.
Everybody complains.

707
00:58:59,918 --> 00:59:01,887
-Oh.
-Was it all right otherwise?

708
00:59:12,164 --> 00:59:16,067
Mr. Helpmann, I'm keen to get
into Information Retrieval.

709
00:59:16,168 --> 00:59:19,195
Mr. Helpmann, I'm dying to get
at this woman. No, no... Ohh!

710
00:59:19,304 --> 00:59:21,273
Oh, God.

711
00:59:25,077 --> 00:59:27,978
-Hold up.
-What? Who are you?

712
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:30,981
-Hey! What's going on?
-Where's your invitation?

713
00:59:31,083 --> 00:59:34,574
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
Mother! Mother!

714
00:59:34,686 --> 00:59:36,586
Sam.

715
00:59:36,688 --> 00:59:39,418
I'm so glad you came.

716
00:59:39,525 --> 00:59:41,925
Come in.

717
00:59:42,027 --> 00:59:44,757
-Mother?
-Come in.

718
00:59:45,797 --> 00:59:48,197
Oh, God, Mother, is that you?

719
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:51,202
Of course. Isn't it wonderful?

720
00:59:51,304 --> 00:59:54,603
The bandages came off
just this afternoon.

721
00:59:54,706 --> 00:59:58,608
Come on, darling. Join in the fun.
Simply everybody's here.

722
00:59:58,710 --> 01:00:00,610
Is Mr. Helpmann here?

723
01:00:00,713 --> 01:00:02,612
-Would you stop shoving...
-Yes, he is.

724
01:00:02,715 --> 01:00:05,615
Mr. Helpmann is here, and
he wants to talk to you.

725
01:00:05,717 --> 01:00:07,947
Good. I want to talk to him.

726
01:00:08,054 --> 01:00:12,114
He says that you're the first
person ever to refuse a promotion.

727
01:00:12,224 --> 01:00:14,625
-Ah, well...
-He thinks you should see a doctor.

728
01:00:14,726 --> 01:00:18,561
-Actually, Mother, I've decided...
-Oh, Louis! Louis, you know Sam.

729
01:00:18,664 --> 01:00:21,063
Can you believe it?

730
01:00:21,166 --> 01:00:23,965
It's just me and
my little knife.

731
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:26,971
-Snip, snip, slice, slice.
-It's marvelous.

732
01:00:27,072 --> 01:00:29,974
-Can you believe it?
-Congratulations.

733
01:00:30,076 --> 01:00:32,771
-But this is just the beginning.
-Oh, really?

734
01:00:32,878 --> 01:00:35,871
Oh, Christ, yes. You've seen
her with her clothes off.

735
01:00:35,981 --> 01:00:39,179
Faces are a doddle
compared to tits and ass.

736
01:00:39,284 --> 01:00:42,253
-No hairline.
-Oh, really, Louis!

737
01:00:43,722 --> 01:00:46,190
I've been looking for
you everywhere, Ida.

738
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:53,630
Mother. Mother, I have to talk to Mr.
Helpmann.

739
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:57,362
-Oh, you stupid sod.
-Dear boy.

740
01:00:57,469 --> 01:00:59,733
What do you think
of your mother now?

741
01:00:59,838 --> 01:01:01,806
<i>It'll never last.</i>

742
01:01:04,143 --> 01:01:06,043
Excuse me.

743
01:01:06,144 --> 01:01:08,670
Dr. Chapman, did
you say something?

744
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:10,748
That technique... I've tried it.

745
01:01:10,849 --> 01:01:14,251
Oh, nice effect, but
highly unstable.

746
01:01:14,353 --> 01:01:18,550
<i>In six months she'll
look like Grandma Moses.</i>

747
01:01:18,657 --> 01:01:23,561
Now, see here, Chapman, at least mine don't
end up looking like they've been mugged.

748
01:01:23,663 --> 01:01:26,257
Sam! Sam!

749
01:01:28,367 --> 01:01:33,235
<i>What have you done
with his body?</i>

750
01:01:33,338 --> 01:01:36,034
Sam!

751
01:01:36,141 --> 01:01:37,541
<i>Sam?</i>

752
01:01:37,643 --> 01:01:41,545
-What on earth's happened to you?
-There was a little complication.

753
01:01:41,646 --> 01:01:46,846
Dr. Chapman says it often happens
with a delicate skin like mine.

754
01:01:46,952 --> 01:01:48,853
Nothing to worry about.

755
01:01:48,954 --> 01:01:52,413
He's promised me these bandages
will be off in a jiffy.

756
01:01:52,525 --> 01:01:55,358
-Actually, there's someone I want to meet.
-Oh, I know.

757
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:57,759
I know.

758
01:02:00,065 --> 01:02:02,534
There we are.

759
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:06,365
I'm going to leave you
two lovebirds in peace.

760
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:09,739
Hello, Shirley.

761
01:02:09,842 --> 01:02:13,333
-Oh, God.
-Come on!

762
01:02:13,445 --> 01:02:15,414
Do you want a drink?

763
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:20,481
Oh. Hello.

764
01:02:20,585 --> 01:02:23,487
Chase those years away!

765
01:02:23,588 --> 01:02:25,954
Listen, Shirley...

766
01:02:26,057 --> 01:02:30,119
your mother and my mother, they
seem to have got the idea that...

767
01:02:30,228 --> 01:02:32,628
Look, I'm very flattered
and, uh, well...

768
01:02:32,731 --> 01:02:35,632
I just don't want you to be
under any false impressions.

769
01:02:35,735 --> 01:02:37,635
It's all right.

770
01:02:37,737 --> 01:02:40,034
I don't like you either.

771
01:02:41,606 --> 01:02:43,574
<i>Sam!</i>

772
01:02:44,409 --> 01:02:46,708
Jack. Excuse me, Shirley.

773
01:02:46,811 --> 01:02:50,509
I'm s... I'm sorry.

774
01:02:51,550 --> 01:02:54,916
-Sam! You remember Alison?
-Evening.

775
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:57,717
Alison. Sam Lowry. Old friend.

776
01:02:57,822 --> 01:03:00,052
Alison, yes, of course.

777
01:03:00,159 --> 01:03:03,059
-You look different.
-Well, I'm two years older.

778
01:03:03,161 --> 01:03:05,289
-And she's been to Dr. Jaffe.
-Ah.

779
01:03:05,398 --> 01:03:08,423
She doesn't like me telling people,
but, in fact, she's really pleased.

780
01:03:08,534 --> 01:03:12,264
-I knew there was something different.
-Remember how they used to stick out?

781
01:03:12,371 --> 01:03:16,431
What? Oh, yes. Uh, well, rather.

782
01:03:16,541 --> 01:03:19,840
-Always used to wonder if they were real.
-What, my ears?

783
01:03:21,213 --> 01:03:23,112
Sorry?

784
01:03:23,215 --> 01:03:25,342
Dr. Jaffe pinned her ears back.

785
01:03:25,451 --> 01:03:27,351
Yes, that's what I...

786
01:03:27,452 --> 01:03:29,717
Always used to wonder
if she wore falsies.

787
01:03:29,822 --> 01:03:32,085
Ah! Mr. Helpmann.

788
01:03:32,190 --> 01:03:35,057
False ears... Mr. Helpmann!

789
01:03:35,226 --> 01:03:37,786
-Hello, Jack.
-You remember my wife, Alison?

790
01:03:37,896 --> 01:03:39,797
Yes, of course.
Barbara, isn't it?

791
01:03:39,898 --> 01:03:41,798
-How are you?
-Well, actuall...

792
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:44,802
Barbara's very well, thank you, sir.
Very well indeed. How are you?

793
01:03:44,903 --> 01:03:46,804
-Fine, thanks.
-Good.

794
01:03:46,905 --> 01:03:50,432
Hello, Sam. Ida said you might be here.
Have you got a minute?

795
01:03:50,543 --> 01:03:53,443
-Would you excuse us?
-Oh, no, of course.

796
01:03:53,545 --> 01:03:56,173
Of course. Come on, Alison...
Barbara.

797
01:03:57,650 --> 01:03:59,617
Sam.

798
01:04:02,788 --> 01:04:04,755
I need your help.

799
01:04:26,711 --> 01:04:29,271
Thanks very much, Sam.

800
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:32,009
Mr. Helpmann, I'm
glad to be of help.

801
01:04:32,117 --> 01:04:35,679
-If I can help you...
-Ah, well, actually...

802
01:04:35,788 --> 01:04:37,778
Oh.

803
01:04:40,358 --> 01:04:43,260
Your father and I
were very close.

804
01:04:43,362 --> 01:04:47,695
Of course, Jeremiah was senior to
me, but we were close friends.

805
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:50,233
Especially after the bombing.

806
01:04:51,402 --> 01:04:55,168
And I keep his name alive
at the office every day.

807
01:04:56,208 --> 01:04:58,869
It's as though he's there
still speaking to me.

808
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:02,378
"'Ere I am.

809
01:05:02,481 --> 01:05:05,074
J.H."

810
01:05:06,719 --> 01:05:08,846
The ghost in the machine.

811
01:05:11,222 --> 01:05:14,681
I know he would have
wanted me to help you.

812
01:05:16,728 --> 01:05:19,128
And I promised your mother...

813
01:05:19,231 --> 01:05:23,634
that I'd take you on to the
team at Information Retrieval.

814
01:05:23,735 --> 01:05:26,068
But I gather that, um...

815
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:30,905
Well, actually, Mr. Helpmann, I've, uh...
I've changed my mind.

816
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:34,309
I've decided I'd
accept the transfer...

817
01:05:34,413 --> 01:05:36,380
if I'm not too late.

818
01:05:37,416 --> 01:05:39,315
Too late?

819
01:05:39,418 --> 01:05:41,476
That's for me to say.

820
01:05:41,586 --> 01:05:44,054
Well... Well, then, I, uh...

821
01:05:46,925 --> 01:05:49,393
Welcome to Information
Retrieval.

822
01:06:22,961 --> 01:06:24,929
Uh, my name's Lowry.

823
01:06:26,097 --> 01:06:28,088
Sam Lowry.

824
01:06:28,199 --> 01:06:31,601
I've been told to report
to Mr. Warrenn.

825
01:06:31,704 --> 01:06:33,831
<i>Thirtieth floor, sir.</i>

826
01:06:33,938 --> 01:06:35,907
<i>You're expected.</i>

827
01:06:37,576 --> 01:06:41,478
Um, don't you want to search me?

828
01:06:41,579 --> 01:06:43,547
<i>No, sir.</i>

829
01:06:44,817 --> 01:06:47,445
<i>-Want to see my I.D.?
-No need, sir.</i>

830
01:06:49,655 --> 01:06:52,885
<i>-But I could be anybody.
-No, you couldn't, sir.</i>

831
01:06:52,992 --> 01:06:55,893
<i>This is Information Retrieval.</i>

832
01:06:55,994 --> 01:06:59,123
<i>The lift's arrived, sir.</i>

833
01:08:21,512 --> 01:08:25,005
I want that order rescinded!

834
01:08:46,404 --> 01:08:48,430
<i>Half as terrorists,
the rest as victims.</i>

835
01:08:48,539 --> 01:08:50,201
Yes. No.

836
01:08:50,309 --> 01:08:52,037
Definitely no!

837
01:08:52,144 --> 01:08:54,840
-My name's Lowry, Mr. Warrenn. Sam Lowry.
-Ah, Lowry!

838
01:08:54,947 --> 01:08:59,440
Yes. No. Cancel that. Okay.

839
01:08:59,551 --> 01:09:01,984
-Glad to have you aboard. Yes.
-These requisitions...

840
01:09:02,087 --> 01:09:05,113
-Sir, I'd like to point this out...
-No! Don't be ridiculous, Jenkins.

841
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:07,715
-About these invoices...
-Yes. Yes. Yes.

842
01:09:07,826 --> 01:09:09,987
You'll like it up here.
Send that back.

843
01:09:10,095 --> 01:09:13,257
We've got a crack team of... Are
they kidding? ... decision makers.

844
01:09:13,364 --> 01:09:15,265
No, in triplicate.

845
01:09:15,367 --> 01:09:17,835
I'm expecting big things...
Two copies to Financial!

846
01:09:17,935 --> 01:09:21,837
No. No. Don't let
Progress see those.

847
01:09:21,939 --> 01:09:25,534
Between you and me, Lowry, this... No, no!
Department... Tell Records to get stuffed!

848
01:09:25,644 --> 01:09:27,543
Is about to be upgraded and...

849
01:09:27,645 --> 01:09:31,412
Ah! Here we are.

850
01:09:31,516 --> 01:09:34,747
<i>Your very own number
on your very own door.</i>

851
01:09:34,853 --> 01:09:37,753
And behind that door,
your very own office.

852
01:09:37,855 --> 01:09:40,756
Congratulations, DZ/015.

853
01:09:40,859 --> 01:09:42,884
Welcome to the team.

854
01:09:42,994 --> 01:09:45,360
Yes! No! Cancel that!

855
01:09:45,463 --> 01:09:47,728
<i>Send two copies to Financial!</i>

856
01:11:21,726 --> 01:11:23,627
Well, you can't borrow
any more chairs!

857
01:11:23,729 --> 01:11:26,288
There's only one left in here
now, and I need that to sit on!

858
01:11:26,398 --> 01:11:27,989
What?

859
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:30,125
Oh.

860
01:11:30,234 --> 01:11:32,795
Sorry.

861
01:11:32,904 --> 01:11:34,963
Who are you?

862
01:11:35,073 --> 01:11:37,472
My name's Lowry. Sam Lowry.

863
01:11:37,576 --> 01:11:40,875
Oh, yes. The new boy
from next door.

864
01:11:41,913 --> 01:11:44,814
My name's Lime. Harvey Lime.

865
01:11:44,917 --> 01:11:46,817
Welcome to Expediting.

866
01:11:46,918 --> 01:11:49,819
I say, look, would you mind if I
borrowed your computer console?

867
01:11:49,921 --> 01:11:50,646
What?

868
01:11:50,671 --> 01:11:52,846
Yes, I'll let you have
it back in 10 minutes.

869
01:11:52,925 --> 01:11:56,520
You want to take my
console into your office?

870
01:11:56,627 --> 01:11:58,528
Yes. Just for a few minutes.

871
01:11:58,630 --> 01:12:00,654
I-I'll tell you what.

872
01:12:00,765 --> 01:12:02,756
You tell me what you want...

873
01:12:02,868 --> 01:12:05,029
and I'll do it for you.

874
01:12:05,136 --> 01:12:07,435
I'm a bit of a whiz
on that thing.

875
01:12:07,538 --> 01:12:09,439
Um...

876
01:12:09,541 --> 01:12:11,440
all right.

877
01:12:11,542 --> 01:12:15,377
Uh, I need some information
on a woman named Layton.

878
01:12:15,479 --> 01:12:17,448
A woman, eh?

879
01:12:17,548 --> 01:12:19,846
-I see.
-Yes.

880
01:12:19,952 --> 01:12:23,581
I know her age and distinguishing marks,
but I need an address or a place of work.

881
01:12:23,689 --> 01:12:26,590
This your dream girl, is it?

882
01:12:26,692 --> 01:12:28,853
What? Um...

883
01:12:28,961 --> 01:12:31,020
Look, let me use your console.

884
01:12:31,128 --> 01:12:33,029
You must be joking.

885
01:12:33,131 --> 01:12:38,125
When there's a woman involved,
there's no stopping me.

886
01:12:38,235 --> 01:12:40,203
Let's have that sheet.

887
01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:51,149
Sod it! It's broken!

888
01:12:51,248 --> 01:12:53,216
You haven't switched it on.

889
01:12:54,485 --> 01:12:56,453
Oh, yes.

890
01:13:00,024 --> 01:13:01,225
Look, you're putting
me off standing there.

891
01:13:01,226 --> 01:13:02,654
Why don't you go back to your office
and I'll give you a knock

892
01:13:02,679 --> 01:13:04,377
when I'm finished.
-Um...

893
01:13:06,163 --> 01:13:08,496
Go on. I'm not going
to elope with her.

894
01:13:10,002 --> 01:13:11,970
All right.

895
01:13:47,072 --> 01:13:49,801
Sam!

896
01:14:11,595 --> 01:14:14,189
Sam.

897
01:14:15,934 --> 01:14:17,902
Don't go.

898
01:14:19,503 --> 01:14:22,029
Please.

899
01:14:33,685 --> 01:14:35,845
Well?

900
01:14:35,953 --> 01:14:38,354
Computers are my forte.

901
01:14:38,457 --> 01:14:40,356
Let me see.

902
01:14:40,458 --> 01:14:44,555
"Jillian Layton. Coloring: White. Hair:
Blonde. Eyes: Blue. Height: 5 foot 4.

903
01:14:44,662 --> 01:14:47,324
Distinguishing marks:
Scar on left"...

904
01:14:47,431 --> 01:14:49,332
Is this all you've got?

905
01:14:49,434 --> 01:14:53,336
Best to take things slowly where
some women are concerned.

906
01:14:53,438 --> 01:14:55,405
Let me see.

907
01:14:55,506 --> 01:14:58,442
Hey! That's mine!

908
01:14:59,478 --> 01:15:01,377
"Layton.

909
01:15:01,479 --> 01:15:02,680
"Truck driver.

910
01:15:02,681 --> 01:15:07,278
All inquiries, reference
office of 412/L, room 5001."

911
01:15:11,622 --> 01:15:13,681
Ah, Lowry, glad I caught you.
No! Send that back!

912
01:15:13,792 --> 01:15:15,224
-Mr. Warrenn!
-Are you settling down?

913
01:15:15,248 --> 01:15:16,341
I want this order rescinded.

914
01:15:16,427 --> 01:15:19,328
There's a query about a personnel
transporter you took out from the pool.

915
01:15:19,329 --> 01:15:20,930
Tell them no. Tell them yes.

916
01:15:20,931 --> 01:15:23,492
Or was it a personnel carrier you
took out from Transportation?

917
01:15:23,601 --> 01:15:26,502
Send that up to Security.
Anyway, tidy it up, Lowry.

918
01:15:26,604 --> 01:15:28,505
There's a good chap.
And get a new suit.

919
01:15:28,606 --> 01:15:30,506
Don't you want the lift?

920
01:16:47,819 --> 01:16:51,152
Can I help you?

921
01:16:51,256 --> 01:16:54,747
<i>No! No! No! Please!</i>

922
01:16:54,859 --> 01:16:58,694
I'm, uh... I'm looking
for Officer 412/L.

923
01:16:58,796 --> 01:17:01,265
He won't be very long now.

924
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:05,827
I thought so.

925
01:17:12,777 --> 01:17:15,404
You may go in now.

926
01:17:17,948 --> 01:17:21,042
Oh, uh, not that one.

927
01:17:21,152 --> 01:17:24,019
<i>That one. Yes.</i>

928
01:17:31,796 --> 01:17:34,730
Excuse me. Are you
Officer 412/L?

929
01:17:41,139 --> 01:17:43,106
Excuse me!

930
01:17:44,442 --> 01:17:46,136
Jack.

931
01:17:46,243 --> 01:17:48,234
Sam.

932
01:17:48,345 --> 01:17:51,109
Ah! I heard you
were coming aboard.

933
01:17:51,216 --> 01:17:55,243
Congratulations, "DZ/015."

934
01:17:55,353 --> 01:17:57,377
Thanks. Are you Officer 412/L?

935
01:17:57,488 --> 01:17:59,889
Uh-huh. That's me.

936
01:17:59,990 --> 01:18:03,289
Oh, and, Sam, a very
happy Christmas.

937
01:18:03,395 --> 01:18:05,295
-Thanks, Jack.
-Are you settling in all right?

938
01:18:05,396 --> 01:18:08,729
Yes, fine. Jack, I... I
need some information.

939
01:18:08,832 --> 01:18:11,893
Oh, Sam, this is Information
Retrieval, not Information Dispersal.

940
01:18:12,002 --> 01:18:13,903
Hey! Amy!

941
01:18:14,005 --> 01:18:15,904
Don't throw the ball
around in here.

942
01:18:16,006 --> 01:18:17,907
I'm not Amy. I'm Holly.

943
01:18:18,009 --> 01:18:20,033
Did I call you Amy, darling?
I'm sorry.

944
01:18:20,145 --> 01:18:22,078
-A triplet?
-One of them, I think.

945
01:18:22,180 --> 01:18:25,046
Barbara's taken the other
two Christmas shopping.

946
01:18:25,149 --> 01:18:28,051
You're not going to keep
calling her Barbara, are you?

947
01:18:28,153 --> 01:18:30,849
Why ever not? Barbara's a
perfectly good name, isn't it?

948
01:18:30,956 --> 01:18:33,480
Don't you like it?

949
01:18:33,591 --> 01:18:35,684
Yes, it's... fine.

950
01:18:35,793 --> 01:18:38,762
Come on. Let's get
these together.

951
01:18:38,863 --> 01:18:41,559
<i>-Jack.
-Now bring me the blue one over there.</i>

952
01:18:41,666 --> 01:18:43,565
I need to find out
about a woman.

953
01:18:43,667 --> 01:18:47,694
Come on, Chloe, let's show Uncle Sam here
how we can make the word "cat." Shall we?

954
01:18:47,805 --> 01:18:50,365
-I'm Holly.
-Sorry, love. So you are.

955
01:18:50,475 --> 01:18:52,443
-Cat.
-This is her.

956
01:18:53,712 --> 01:18:55,612
Layton.

957
01:18:55,713 --> 01:18:57,681
Oh, shit.

958
01:18:59,216 --> 01:19:01,377
-How much do you know about this?
-Uh, not much.

959
01:19:01,485 --> 01:19:03,920
What does B58/732 mean to you?

960
01:19:04,021 --> 01:19:06,922
-Buttle.
-I knew it.

961
01:19:07,024 --> 01:19:10,188
You always were
bloody quick, Sam.

962
01:19:10,295 --> 01:19:13,662
Who else knows? Warrenn?
Helpmann?

963
01:19:13,765 --> 01:19:15,994
I don't know. I only know
you got the wrong man.

964
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:19,002
Information Transit
got the wrong man.

965
01:19:19,104 --> 01:19:21,003
I got the right man.

966
01:19:21,105 --> 01:19:22,805
The wrong man was delivered
to me as the right man.

967
01:19:22,807 --> 01:19:26,708
I accepted him on good faith
as the right man. Was I wrong?

968
01:19:27,112 --> 01:19:29,011
You killed Buttle?

969
01:19:30,114 --> 01:19:34,676
Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid
down to prevent such things happening.

970
01:19:34,786 --> 01:19:38,153
It wasn't my fault that Buttle's heart
condition didn't appear on Tuttle's file.

971
01:19:38,256 --> 01:19:40,155
Come and look. How
you getting on?

972
01:19:40,257 --> 01:19:43,226
<i>-Jack.
-A, B, C...</i>

973
01:19:43,328 --> 01:19:45,557
-I really need to know about...
-Tuttle?

974
01:19:45,662 --> 01:19:48,324
Well, we're gonna have to bring
Mr. Tuttle in, aren't we?

975
01:19:48,432 --> 01:19:51,333
And interrogate him at the
same voltage as Mr. Buttle.

976
01:19:51,435 --> 01:19:53,336
And juggle the books
in Electrical Banking.

977
01:19:53,438 --> 01:19:54,685
What has Tuttle done?

978
01:19:54,710 --> 01:19:57,557
We suspect him of, uh,
freelance subversion.

979
01:19:57,641 --> 01:19:59,609
A freelance subversive.

980
01:19:59,711 --> 01:20:02,645
Then all I need to wrap up the
case is the Layton woman.

981
01:20:02,747 --> 01:20:04,646
What has she done?

982
01:20:04,748 --> 01:20:07,512
Well, she witnessed the Tuttle...
Um, the Buttle arrest.

983
01:20:07,618 --> 01:20:09,984
Since then, she's been going
around making wild allegations...

984
01:20:10,087 --> 01:20:12,521
obviously trying to
exploit the situation.

985
01:20:12,623 --> 01:20:14,887
She's working for someone,
and I don't think it's us.

986
01:20:14,993 --> 01:20:17,689
-That's it. Over there, love.
-Terrorist?

987
01:20:20,131 --> 01:20:22,360
Mr. Lint, the next customer
has been delivered.

988
01:20:22,466 --> 01:20:23,317
Thank you, Myrtle.

989
01:20:23,341 --> 01:20:25,654
What are you gonna do
about the Layton woman?

990
01:20:25,737 --> 01:20:29,639
Well, I put her on the detention list.
Security should have her here before 6:00.

991
01:20:30,975 --> 01:20:34,740
What, here? So that she can spill
the beans inside the department?

992
01:20:35,845 --> 01:20:36,936
Don't do that!

993
01:20:36,948 --> 01:20:40,314
Jack, why don't I try
and get to her for you?

994
01:20:40,417 --> 01:20:43,386
I'll, um... I'll deactivate her.

995
01:20:43,488 --> 01:20:47,082
What does that mean, Sam? I don't want
to get involved in anything unsavory.

996
01:20:47,192 --> 01:20:48,819
Trust me, Jack.

997
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:52,546
Come on, darling. Put these away now.
Mummy'll be here soon.

998
01:20:52,572 --> 01:20:53,444
Let me have her file.

999
01:20:55,466 --> 01:20:57,935
Look, trust me, Jack.

1000
01:20:59,304 --> 01:21:01,570
All right. Come on here.

1001
01:21:03,073 --> 01:21:06,365
All right, but for Christ's
sake, don't lose it.

1002
01:21:06,377 --> 01:21:08,402
All right.

1003
01:21:09,012 --> 01:21:11,207
You sit down there, Mary. Sam.

1004
01:21:11,315 --> 01:21:13,283
Don't worry. I'll get to her.

1005
01:21:13,384 --> 01:21:15,681
You'll never get anywhere
in a suit like that.

1006
01:21:17,454 --> 01:21:19,149
Here.

1007
01:21:20,190 --> 01:21:22,421
Try this.

1008
01:21:22,527 --> 01:21:24,926
-Bye-bye.
-Bye!

1009
01:21:25,029 --> 01:21:29,295
Uh, but, Jack, I...

1010
01:21:29,399 --> 01:21:33,564
Put it on, big boy. I
won't look at your willy.

1011
01:21:44,782 --> 01:21:47,273
Oh, let him go.

1012
01:21:55,393 --> 01:21:58,293
Trier, isn't he?

1013
01:22:32,596 --> 01:22:37,226
Just... I've been to
the department of...

1014
01:22:56,287 --> 01:23:00,279
But you've stamped this form before.
Why won't you stamp it now?

1015
01:23:00,390 --> 01:23:03,882
You just said yourself, miss...
we've already stamped it.

1016
01:23:12,636 --> 01:23:16,037
No, no! Stop!

1017
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:19,041
Up! Up! Up! Up! Up!

1018
01:23:21,179 --> 01:23:23,613
Oh, God.

1019
01:23:23,715 --> 01:23:25,682
Come on!

1020
01:23:28,619 --> 01:23:30,144
Shit!

1021
01:23:45,036 --> 01:23:47,435
<i>Oi! Come out of there.</i>

1022
01:23:47,537 --> 01:23:50,404
-What?
-That's the deputy minister's lift.

1023
01:23:50,507 --> 01:23:53,568
-I'm sorry. I'm in a hurry.
-Oi, come here.

1024
01:23:53,677 --> 01:23:56,578
Come here, sonny. Let's see your I.D.
Card, eh?

1025
01:23:56,680 --> 01:24:00,082
My I.D.? Oh, God.

1026
01:24:00,184 --> 01:24:02,083
This isn't my suit.

1027
01:24:02,185 --> 01:24:06,555
<i>My name is Lowry. Sam Lowry.
Look, really, can't this wait?</i>

1028
01:24:06,658 --> 01:24:10,957
No, sir. I'm going to have
to fill in a report on this.

1029
01:24:11,061 --> 01:24:13,962
Now, then, uh, what
is the date today?

1030
01:24:14,064 --> 01:24:16,363
It's the... Oh, God,
it'll have to wait!

1031
01:24:16,466 --> 01:24:19,458
Oi! Oi, you! Stop! Come back here!
Stop!

1032
01:24:42,793 --> 01:24:45,591
Aim!

1033
01:24:49,833 --> 01:24:51,734
Stop! Don't...

1034
01:24:51,836 --> 01:24:53,735
Up!

1035
01:25:05,283 --> 01:25:08,684
Well done, men. Quick thinking.

1036
01:25:08,786 --> 01:25:10,685
Excellent work.

1037
01:25:10,787 --> 01:25:14,689
Um... I'll take
charge of her now.

1038
01:25:14,792 --> 01:25:16,692
Good. Good man.

1039
01:25:16,793 --> 01:25:19,194
Um, okay.

1040
01:25:19,296 --> 01:25:22,663
Uh... It's a...

1041
01:25:23,900 --> 01:25:25,595
classified matter...

1042
01:25:25,703 --> 01:25:28,069
and, um, I'll, uh...

1043
01:25:28,171 --> 01:25:32,233
I'll include your fine handling
of the situation in my report.

1044
01:25:32,342 --> 01:25:34,310
Great.

1045
01:25:35,613 --> 01:25:38,445
Uh, merry Christmas, Dawson.

1046
01:25:38,548 --> 01:25:42,451
Come along with me, please.
Please? Okay. Yes.

1047
01:25:42,552 --> 01:25:44,885
Well done, men. Excellent.

1048
01:25:44,988 --> 01:25:47,617
Good turnout. Nice. Very good.
Thank you.

1049
01:25:49,394 --> 01:25:52,521
No, no, no. This way, please.
Straight ahead.

1050
01:26:00,438 --> 01:26:02,337
This way. This way.

1051
01:26:02,439 --> 01:26:04,805
This way.

1052
01:26:07,779 --> 01:26:09,679
Just keep moving.

1053
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:11,715
<i>-Hey! Stop!
-What?</i>

1054
01:26:13,083 --> 01:26:14,881
Come back here!

1055
01:26:14,985 --> 01:26:16,680
Pick up all these things!

1056
01:26:16,787 --> 01:26:19,881
<i>-Come on! Pick them up!
-Geez... Oh...</i>

1057
01:26:19,990 --> 01:26:22,585
<i>Disgraceful!</i>

1058
01:26:22,693 --> 01:26:24,717
-Can't you read English?
-Ow! Get your bloody...

1059
01:26:24,828 --> 01:26:29,595
You illiterate foreign pig! You
come over here on your own...

1060
01:26:32,203 --> 01:26:34,932
...and think you can
mess up our streets!

1061
01:26:35,038 --> 01:26:37,404
Oh, God.

1062
01:26:38,509 --> 01:26:40,943
Stop!

1063
01:26:51,655 --> 01:26:54,453
That's it! Let's go!
Vroom! Vroom!

1064
01:26:58,496 --> 01:27:01,795
What are you doing? For
Christ's sake, keep moving!

1065
01:27:03,701 --> 01:27:05,793
-Get out of my cab.
-What?

1066
01:27:05,903 --> 01:27:07,871
Just drive!

1067
01:27:09,172 --> 01:27:11,073
You touched me.
Nobody touches me.

1068
01:27:11,175 --> 01:27:13,369
What are you... Oh, God!

1069
01:27:13,478 --> 01:27:15,377
Please! Please! Drive on!

1070
01:27:15,479 --> 01:27:18,381
Drive on, will you! For... Oh, shit.
Move over. I'll drive.

1071
01:27:18,483 --> 01:27:21,747
Don't touch that!
Don't touch anything!

1072
01:27:24,322 --> 01:27:28,622
It's okay, Officer. Thank you. It's okay.
Got everything under control. Thank you.

1073
01:27:28,725 --> 01:27:30,956
Oh, shit. They're coming.

1074
01:27:31,061 --> 01:27:35,122
Listen, please drive. Drive. Trust me.
You are in terrible danger.

1075
01:27:35,233 --> 01:27:37,394
<i>You are an embarrassment.
Please.</i>

1076
01:27:37,502 --> 01:27:39,493
Please drive. Trust me.
Trust me.

1077
01:27:39,604 --> 01:27:41,868
<i>Drive, and I'll
explain everything.</i>

1078
01:27:41,972 --> 01:27:43,872
Please...

1079
01:27:43,975 --> 01:27:45,966
get out of my cab.

1080
01:27:47,244 --> 01:27:49,610
-I'm sorry. I...
-Okay!

1081
01:27:49,713 --> 01:27:51,613
Okay, you've asked for it!

1082
01:27:51,716 --> 01:27:53,979
I'm Information
Retrieval Officer D...

1083
01:27:54,085 --> 01:27:55,984
DZ/105!

1084
01:27:56,087 --> 01:27:58,317
And I'm arresting you as a...

1085
01:27:58,421 --> 01:28:01,550
Drive on, or I'll blast
your fucking head off!

1086
01:28:04,095 --> 01:28:06,063
Go!

1087
01:28:24,614 --> 01:28:27,015
Look, I'm, uh... I'm
sorry about that.

1088
01:28:27,118 --> 01:28:29,347
I mean, uh, touching you
without permission.

1089
01:28:29,453 --> 01:28:32,012
But, um... Hello.

1090
01:28:32,122 --> 01:28:34,716
My name is Lowry. Sam Lowry.

1091
01:28:34,824 --> 01:28:37,020
I... I'm... I've been, uh...

1092
01:28:41,131 --> 01:28:45,033
You won't believe this, and I know
it's going to sound incredible...

1093
01:28:45,136 --> 01:28:48,229
but, um... but I've been
dreaming about you.

1094
01:28:49,273 --> 01:28:51,900
No, not like that. I
mean, I love you.

1095
01:28:52,676 --> 01:28:55,510
In my dreams I love you.

1096
01:28:55,613 --> 01:28:59,572
And, uh... I mean...
Extraordinary, isn't it?

1097
01:29:04,287 --> 01:29:06,847
Anyway, um...

1098
01:29:06,957 --> 01:29:08,858
<i>y-y-you...</i>

1099
01:29:11,462 --> 01:29:13,692
You don't believe me, do you?

1100
01:29:13,797 --> 01:29:15,698
You, um...

1101
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:20,260
You probably think I-I-I-I'm
bonkers, right? Mad. Raving.

1102
01:29:21,939 --> 01:29:25,704
No! No, I think you're
very attractive.

1103
01:29:26,810 --> 01:29:28,243
What?

1104
01:29:29,346 --> 01:29:32,440
Yeah. Yeah, sit back. Let
me have a look at you.

1105
01:29:40,323 --> 01:29:42,587
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1106
01:29:42,693 --> 01:29:46,094
Good-looking, sexy.
Just my type.

1107
01:29:47,965 --> 01:29:50,627
I don't believe you.

1108
01:29:50,734 --> 01:29:52,292
Why not?

1109
01:29:52,403 --> 01:29:56,237
Well, I-I... I just don't
deserve such terrific luck.

1110
01:29:57,641 --> 01:29:59,371
Damn right.

1111
01:30:24,568 --> 01:30:26,467
Help!

1112
01:31:01,204 --> 01:31:04,605
I love...

1113
01:31:47,149 --> 01:31:48,676
You don't trust me, do you?

1114
01:31:48,685 --> 01:31:51,984
Oh!

1115
01:32:24,354 --> 01:32:26,154
Oh, my God. We shouldn't
have come here.

1116
01:32:26,157 --> 01:32:28,556
I got a job to do!

1117
01:32:28,658 --> 01:32:32,060
-But they'll be lying in wait.
-Oh, Christ, you're paranoid.

1118
01:32:32,162 --> 01:32:34,563
You've got no sense of reality.

1119
01:32:34,664 --> 01:32:36,962
Wait, wait, wait! Wait!

1120
01:32:40,470 --> 01:32:42,802
We should take the
lorry and get away!

1121
01:32:42,907 --> 01:32:45,807
-Yeah? Where to?
-Anywhere, as fast as possible.

1122
01:32:45,909 --> 01:32:48,810
-There isn't anywhere!
-Just far away!

1123
01:32:48,912 --> 01:32:50,813
That's not far enough!

1124
01:32:50,914 --> 01:32:52,882
But... Wait!

1125
01:33:07,863 --> 01:33:09,764
Jill!

1126
01:34:02,453 --> 01:34:04,579
What's in the, uh, parcel?

1127
01:34:05,823 --> 01:34:07,984
-Christmas present.
-Oh.

1128
01:34:15,832 --> 01:34:18,028
It's heavy.

1129
01:34:18,135 --> 01:34:20,261
Heavy Christmas present.

1130
01:34:20,371 --> 01:34:22,532
-You don't trust me, open it.
-No!

1131
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:25,164
No, no, it's, uh... it's fine.

1132
01:34:26,409 --> 01:34:28,673
I'd spoil the wrapping.

1133
01:34:28,779 --> 01:34:32,646
Anyway, if I want you to trust me, then it's
only fair that I should trust you. Right?

1134
01:34:40,524 --> 01:34:44,289
Doesn't it bother you, the sort of
things you do at Information Retrieval?

1135
01:34:44,395 --> 01:34:46,363
What?

1136
01:34:47,497 --> 01:34:50,057
I suppose you'd rather
have terrorists.

1137
01:34:50,167 --> 01:34:52,896
Here's one now.

1138
01:34:54,238 --> 01:34:58,503
How many terrorists have you met, Sam?
Actual terrorists?

1139
01:35:00,810 --> 01:35:02,779
-Actual terrorists?
-Yeah.

1140
01:35:06,516 --> 01:35:09,110
Well... It's only my first day.

1141
01:35:21,230 --> 01:35:24,199
-Uh-oh.
-A roadblock.

1142
01:35:26,203 --> 01:35:28,261
-What are we gonna do?
-Stay calm.

1143
01:35:28,372 --> 01:35:30,271
Don't slow down.
Don't slow down!

1144
01:35:30,373 --> 01:35:33,036
Don't stop. Please.
Please do as I say. Go.

1145
01:35:33,143 --> 01:35:35,304
Go! Straight ahead! Go!

1146
01:35:35,412 --> 01:35:39,109
-Go! Go! Go!
-What are you doing, you stupid asshole?

1147
01:35:44,020 --> 01:35:45,488
Whoo!

1148
01:35:51,694 --> 01:35:53,595
We did it! We did it!

1149
01:35:53,697 --> 01:35:57,132
We broke right through them! We did it!
Whee, whee, whee, whee!

1150
01:36:02,573 --> 01:36:03,672
Faster!
-Get off of me!

1151
01:36:03,698 --> 01:36:05,497
Don't let them see you!
Just go!

1152
01:36:08,412 --> 01:36:11,313
Keep going! Keep going! Faster!

1153
01:36:11,414 --> 01:36:14,850
-Get your foot down on it! Move!
-Stay off of it!

1154
01:36:20,757 --> 01:36:23,625
No!

1155
01:36:28,364 --> 01:36:30,832
Get off!

1156
01:36:38,609 --> 01:36:40,975
Shit!

1157
01:36:43,980 --> 01:36:45,175
Oh, no.

1158
01:36:48,452 --> 01:36:50,146
Go faster! Faster!

1159
01:36:56,159 --> 01:36:59,458
-What if we lose the house, yeah?
-Don't touch anything!

1160
01:37:00,663 --> 01:37:03,257
Don't touch it!

1161
01:37:25,122 --> 01:37:30,024
We did it! We did it! We did it!
We did it!

1162
01:37:36,332 --> 01:37:38,301
<i>Oh, no.</i>

1163
01:37:52,149 --> 01:37:54,777
And what would you
like for Christmas?

1164
01:37:54,885 --> 01:37:57,251
My own credit card.

1165
01:38:01,692 --> 01:38:03,659
Hmm.

1166
01:38:07,797 --> 01:38:10,028
-Why have we come here?
-Go away!

1167
01:38:10,134 --> 01:38:13,534
-Look, why don't we go back to my flat.
-Forget it.

1168
01:38:13,636 --> 01:38:16,037
-You don't trust me?
-Trust you? Trust you?

1169
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:18,369
A man who hijacks my
truck, loses me my job...

1170
01:38:18,475 --> 01:38:20,305
has every security man
in town looking for me?

1171
01:38:20,409 --> 01:38:22,377
-Of course I trust you.
-I was only trying to help.

1172
01:38:22,479 --> 01:38:24,378
-Yeah!
-Okay. Okay.

1173
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:26,381
You don't trust me,
I don't trust you.

1174
01:38:26,483 --> 01:38:28,382
-What's in that parcel?
-Oh, Jesus.

1175
01:38:28,484 --> 01:38:30,483
You saved it from the lorry. It
must be something very special.

1176
01:38:30,488 --> 01:38:33,088
I saved you from the lorry. You're
not something "very special."

1177
01:38:33,091 --> 01:38:35,690
-How can you... I'm gonna open it.
-Don't touch that!

1178
01:38:46,036 --> 01:38:49,493
Sam! It's me!

1179
01:38:49,605 --> 01:38:51,573
<i>And Shirley!</i>

1180
01:38:53,710 --> 01:38:55,677
Mrs. Terrain.

1181
01:38:58,715 --> 01:39:01,309
<i>-That should hold it.
-Sam?</i>

1182
01:39:01,417 --> 01:39:03,943
Hello, Shirley.

1183
01:39:06,355 --> 01:39:08,619
My God, what on earth's
happened to you now?

1184
01:39:08,725 --> 01:39:12,456
My complication had a
little complication.

1185
01:39:12,563 --> 01:39:16,521
<i>But Dr. Chapman says
I'll soon be up...</i>

1186
01:39:16,632 --> 01:39:19,966
<i>and bounding about
like a young gazelle.</i>

1187
01:39:20,069 --> 01:39:22,663
You buying a Christmas
present for your mother?

1188
01:39:22,773 --> 01:39:24,672
What?

1189
01:39:24,774 --> 01:39:27,641
Oh, um, yes. A little something.

1190
01:39:27,743 --> 01:39:31,338
Shirley and I come
here "wegularlarly."

1191
01:39:32,416 --> 01:39:34,509
We love romantic lingerie.

1192
01:39:34,618 --> 01:39:36,847
Really?

1193
01:39:36,953 --> 01:39:41,050
Sam, picture me in these.

1194
01:39:46,296 --> 01:39:49,197
-Oh, my God.
-Sam, where are you going?

1195
01:39:49,298 --> 01:39:53,167
Sam! Sam!

1196
01:40:01,845 --> 01:40:03,710
Jill?

1197
01:40:07,117 --> 01:40:09,085
Jill!

1198
01:40:25,101 --> 01:40:27,002
Oh, my God. Are you all right?

1199
01:40:31,541 --> 01:40:33,509
Well, you don't deserve to be!

1200
01:40:33,609 --> 01:40:36,636
What a bloody stupid thing!

1201
01:40:36,747 --> 01:40:40,079
How could you? Look at these people!
My God!

1202
01:40:40,182 --> 01:40:42,947
It was a bomb. It was a bomb.

1203
01:40:43,052 --> 01:40:45,953
I should have opened it. I sat
there with it next... I...

1204
01:40:46,055 --> 01:40:48,046
<i>What a stupid thing.</i>

1205
01:40:48,158 --> 01:40:50,091
There's your bomb, asshole!

1206
01:40:54,064 --> 01:40:55,963
Bribes...

1207
01:40:56,065 --> 01:40:58,125
for official monkeys like you.

1208
01:40:58,234 --> 01:41:00,635
Oh.

1209
01:41:02,038 --> 01:41:04,632
Go on. Make yourself useful.

1210
01:41:08,578 --> 01:41:11,774
Here.

1211
01:41:15,319 --> 01:41:18,755
Don't touch her! She's hurt!

1212
01:41:18,854 --> 01:41:22,051
Damn it!

1213
01:41:22,158 --> 01:41:24,787
-Don't touch her!
-No!

1214
01:41:28,064 --> 01:41:29,895
Stop!

1215
01:41:37,207 --> 01:41:39,640
Sam, no! Sam! Behind you!

1216
01:41:52,389 --> 01:41:55,289
These helmets don't half
make your scalp itch.

1217
01:41:55,391 --> 01:41:58,918
Oh, don't mention it. And
they make you sweat.

1218
01:41:59,029 --> 01:42:01,930
<i>Half the time I can't
ever see where I'm going.</i>

1219
01:42:02,032 --> 01:42:05,661
<i>There's a great Niagara of
perspiration coming down.</i>

1220
01:42:05,769 --> 01:42:07,668
Well, I'm lucky.

1221
01:42:07,770 --> 01:42:09,671
I got these thick eyebrows.

1222
01:42:09,773 --> 01:42:13,265
That keeps it up and
channels it out to the ears.

1223
01:42:13,377 --> 01:42:15,277
Yeah. Who's he?

1224
01:42:15,378 --> 01:42:18,314
Oh, I don't know. Somebody
from Information Retrieval.

1225
01:42:18,414 --> 01:42:20,780
They're always hangin'
around in Lingerie.

1226
01:42:20,884 --> 01:42:24,376
Where is she? Huh?

1227
01:42:24,488 --> 01:42:26,456
Jill, is that you?

1228
01:42:26,555 --> 01:42:30,855
Uh... Excuse me, sir. That
is government property.

1229
01:42:31,895 --> 01:42:34,125
Oh, Jill.

1230
01:42:36,065 --> 01:42:38,261
Jill! Answer me!

1231
01:42:40,069 --> 01:42:42,560
I'm looking for a girl
with blonde hair.

1232
01:42:42,671 --> 01:42:45,300
She's medium height, green eyes.

1233
01:42:45,408 --> 01:42:48,775
I don't know, sir. They check
all that at the depot.

1234
01:42:48,878 --> 01:42:52,474
Uh, we can't allow that, sir.
It's more than our job's worth.

1235
01:42:52,582 --> 01:42:55,483
Jill! Jill, you must be here!
Jill!

1236
01:42:55,585 --> 01:42:58,917
Look, sir, you can fill in an application
form, sir, if you're a relative.

1237
01:42:59,021 --> 01:43:00,921
Now, do stop, sir. Please.

1238
01:43:01,024 --> 01:43:03,253
Jill? Jill?

1239
01:43:03,359 --> 01:43:05,260
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.

1240
01:43:08,899 --> 01:43:12,528
Sorry about that, sir.
Regulations.

1241
01:43:18,307 --> 01:43:21,175
<i>This is a black eye for
the department, Lowry.</i>

1242
01:43:21,278 --> 01:43:23,507
I don't care how you behaved
when you were at Records.

1243
01:43:23,613 --> 01:43:26,342
Information Retrieval
is an executive branch.

1244
01:43:26,449 --> 01:43:29,247
We're proud of our reputation
and we protect it.

1245
01:43:29,351 --> 01:43:33,253
Damn it, Lowry! That convoy of personnel
carriers is still not accounted for!

1246
01:43:33,355 --> 01:43:36,291
I thought I told you to deal with it.
And what the hell is this mess?

1247
01:43:36,393 --> 01:43:38,520
An empty desk is
an efficient desk.

1248
01:43:38,627 --> 01:43:41,391
Good God. Queries from Security.

1249
01:43:41,497 --> 01:43:43,658
Searches from Central
Banking about a check?

1250
01:43:43,766 --> 01:43:46,634
Clarification notices from Accounting
concerning unreturned receipts?

1251
01:43:46,735 --> 01:43:50,228
-Mr. Warrenn, I have to find out about...
-Get up!

1252
01:43:50,340 --> 01:43:53,707
I don't know what's
going on here, Lowry.

1253
01:43:53,810 --> 01:43:58,975
But don't think you can intimidate us with
your friends and relatives in high places.

1254
01:43:59,082 --> 01:44:02,244
Now shape up!

1255
01:44:04,720 --> 01:44:07,622
Lime, I have to use
your computer.

1256
01:44:07,724 --> 01:44:10,123
Sorry. A bit busy at the moment.

1257
01:44:10,226 --> 01:44:13,195
You seem to have rather a lot
to get on with yourself.

1258
01:44:18,734 --> 01:44:21,898
Shit.

1259
01:44:23,239 --> 01:44:25,140
Come off it, Jack.

1260
01:44:25,242 --> 01:44:28,143
Of course you can check to
see if she's been arrested.

1261
01:44:28,244 --> 01:44:29,421
I'm sorry, Sam. I'm afraid
this whole case has become

1262
01:44:29,447 --> 01:44:32,971
much more complicated since last we...
talked.

1263
01:44:33,250 --> 01:44:36,310
But she's innocent, Jack.
She's done nothing wrong.

1264
01:44:36,418 --> 01:44:39,319
Tell that to the wives of the security
men she blew up this afternoon.

1265
01:44:39,421 --> 01:44:41,981
She's not alone in all this.

1266
01:44:42,091 --> 01:44:45,152
We've just had a report in that
Tuttle has wrecked an entire flat...

1267
01:44:45,261 --> 01:44:47,662
and sabotaged adjacent
Central Services.

1268
01:44:47,764 --> 01:44:50,664
As a matter of fact, it
looks like on your block.

1269
01:44:50,766 --> 01:44:53,997
I should keep my eyes open
if I were you, Sam. Bye.

1270
01:44:55,104 --> 01:44:58,268
But, Jack, you don't really think Tuttle
and the girl are in league, do you?

1271
01:44:58,375 --> 01:44:59,774
I do.

1272
01:44:59,876 --> 01:45:01,969
Everything's connected
all along the line.

1273
01:45:02,078 --> 01:45:04,409
Cause and effect. That's
the beauty of it.

1274
01:45:04,514 --> 01:45:07,744
Our job is to trace the
connections and, uh, reveal them.

1275
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:12,820
This whole Buttle-Tuttle confusion was
obviously planned from the inside.

1276
01:45:12,922 --> 01:45:14,823
Bye-bye.

1277
01:45:14,925 --> 01:45:17,154
Oh, but, Jack!

1278
01:45:17,260 --> 01:45:19,819
She's innocent, Jack.

1279
01:45:19,930 --> 01:45:22,831
Sam, we've always been
close, haven't we?

1280
01:45:22,932 --> 01:45:24,832
Yes, Jack?

1281
01:45:24,935 --> 01:45:28,393
Well, until this all blows
over just stay away from me.

1282
01:45:29,506 --> 01:45:31,474
But...

1283
01:47:33,729 --> 01:47:35,755
Oh, my God.

1284
01:47:38,435 --> 01:47:39,993
You.

1285
01:47:41,237 --> 01:47:44,171
It's you. What's happening?

1286
01:47:44,274 --> 01:47:46,367
What's happening?

1287
01:47:46,475 --> 01:47:48,376
Your thermostat's
gone, and then some.

1288
01:47:48,478 --> 01:47:50,377
And then some!

1289
01:47:50,479 --> 01:47:52,380
What's happened to my flat?

1290
01:47:52,481 --> 01:47:55,939
Hello? What? It's for you.

1291
01:47:56,051 --> 01:47:58,987
-But as you don't live here anymore...
-What?

1292
01:47:59,088 --> 01:48:01,854
Absolutely. Do you
know what this is?

1293
01:48:01,859 --> 01:48:05,086
This is an H2206...

1294
01:48:05,194 --> 01:48:09,689
authorizing the compulsory, temporary
requisitioning of this flat...

1295
01:48:09,798 --> 01:48:11,698
for our necessary repairs.

1296
01:48:11,801 --> 01:48:13,701
-Repairs!
-What?

1297
01:48:13,802 --> 01:48:16,203
-No! You...
-Don't forget your receipt.

1298
01:48:16,305 --> 01:48:19,332
-Oh! Oh! Oh!
-No, sir. Don't forget your receipt.

1299
01:48:19,442 --> 01:48:22,502
I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of
a stickler for paperwork.

1300
01:48:22,612 --> 01:48:25,512
<i>He's a stickler for
paperwork, sir!</i>

1301
01:48:25,614 --> 01:48:28,208
Bastards!

1302
01:48:38,694 --> 01:48:41,060
Tuttle.

1303
01:48:41,163 --> 01:48:43,564
-What are you doing?
-Shh.

1304
01:49:00,350 --> 01:49:02,341
<i>Phew-ee.</i>

1305
01:49:33,817 --> 01:49:36,251
Oh, God.

1306
01:49:36,351 --> 01:49:38,819
-Jesus Christ!
-The smell! Stop!

1307
01:49:40,657 --> 01:49:42,556
Filling up with...

1308
01:49:42,658 --> 01:49:46,493
Oh, God.

1309
01:49:47,930 --> 01:49:50,421
Oh, Jesus!

1310
01:49:53,502 --> 01:49:56,233
Oh!

1311
01:49:58,942 --> 01:50:00,909
Shit!

1312
01:50:02,578 --> 01:50:04,479
We're all in it together, kid.

1313
01:50:16,792 --> 01:50:19,353
<i>Jill. Jill!</i>

1314
01:50:20,395 --> 01:50:23,762
Jill. Oh, God.

1315
01:50:23,867 --> 01:50:27,359
Are you all right? What
happened to you after...

1316
01:50:27,470 --> 01:50:30,302
Your face. Are you hurt?

1317
01:50:31,341 --> 01:50:33,240
Um, no, I-I'm fine.

1318
01:50:33,342 --> 01:50:36,779
It's... Well...

1319
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:39,404
I've been worried
sick about you.

1320
01:50:53,296 --> 01:50:56,197
-Who was that?
-That's a friend of mine. He...

1321
01:50:56,298 --> 01:50:59,496
Oh, God. Holy shit.

1322
01:50:59,601 --> 01:51:03,628
We'd better get out of here quick.
Come on. Quietly.

1323
01:51:07,644 --> 01:51:09,612
Look out. Here. Take this.

1324
01:51:11,980 --> 01:51:13,948
Looks big.

1325
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:26,528
Here.

1326
01:51:28,264 --> 01:51:30,561
Quick. Quick.

1327
01:52:05,534 --> 01:52:08,993
-Are you sure this is all right?
-Yes. Yes, certain.

1328
01:52:10,439 --> 01:52:12,567
My mother's away for Christmas.

1329
01:52:13,943 --> 01:52:16,411
She's spending it at
the plastic surgeon's.

1330
01:52:19,849 --> 01:52:21,975
The wraps come off tomorrow.

1331
01:53:02,425 --> 01:53:06,828
Lock the door after me. Don't
answer the phone to anyone.

1332
01:53:06,929 --> 01:53:09,092
I won't be long.

1333
01:53:10,432 --> 01:53:12,934
-Where are you going?
-I know a way to save you.

1334
01:53:12,935 --> 01:53:16,399
-Trust me. I can do it.
-But you can't go without me.

1335
01:53:52,307 --> 01:53:55,368
Excuse me, Dawson. Could you put me
through to Mr. Helpmann's office, please?

1336
01:53:55,478 --> 01:53:57,377
I'm afraid I can't, sir.

1337
01:53:57,479 --> 01:53:59,780
You have to go through
the proper channels.

1338
01:53:59,783 --> 01:54:02,305
And... you can't tell me
what the proper channels are

1339
01:54:02,329 --> 01:54:04,911
because that's...
classified information.

1340
01:54:05,988 --> 01:54:08,127
I'm glad to see the ministry
is continuing its tradition

1341
01:54:08,153 --> 01:54:11,015
of recruiting
the brightest and best, sir.

1342
01:54:11,493 --> 01:54:13,462
Thank you, Dawson.

Is it me?

1367
01:59:06,555 --> 01:59:08,523
Well?

1368
01:59:13,462 --> 01:59:16,363
You don't exist anymore.

1369
01:59:16,465 --> 01:59:18,432
I've killed you.

1370
01:59:22,837 --> 01:59:24,805
Jill Layton is dead.

1371
01:59:33,481 --> 01:59:36,177
Care for a little necrophilia?

1372
01:59:36,284 --> 01:59:38,252
Hmm?

1373
01:59:40,088 --> 01:59:42,216
Yee-hah! Yee-hah!

1374
02:00:39,215 --> 02:00:41,809
Merry Christmas.

1375
02:00:42,917 --> 02:00:44,886
Uh...

1376
02:00:55,230 --> 02:00:57,198
<i>Something for an executive?</i>

1377
02:01:15,451 --> 02:01:18,511
Sh-She's dead. This is
just a friend of mine.

1378
02:01:18,621 --> 02:01:21,521
She's...

1379
02:01:21,623 --> 02:01:23,524
-What are you...
-No!

1380
02:01:23,626 --> 02:01:25,617
-Oh, my God!
-No! Sam!

1381
02:01:32,734 --> 02:01:36,000
"N3/HK/608, you are charged
with the following:

1382
02:01:36,104 --> 02:01:39,039
"Giving aid and comfort to
the enemies of society,

02:01:39,140 --> 02:01:41,041

wasting ministry
time and paper."

1398
02:02:16,311 --> 02:02:18,837
Now, either you plead guilty...

1399
02:02:18,948 --> 02:02:20,847
to, say, seven or eight
of the charges...

1400
02:02:20,949 --> 02:02:24,317
which is going to help keep
costs down within your means...

1401
02:02:24,420 --> 02:02:28,550
or you can borrow a sum, to be negotiated
from us, at a very competitive rate.

1402
02:02:28,657 --> 02:02:32,057
We can offer you something, let's say
11 and a half percent over 30 years...

1403
02:02:32,161 --> 02:02:35,061
but you will have to buy insurance
to qualify for this scheme.

1404
02:02:35,163 --> 02:02:37,654
Or, if you prefer something
more specific...

1405
02:02:37,765 --> 02:02:40,394
say, against electrical
charges over Ł70...

1406
02:02:40,502 --> 02:02:43,561
All you're requested to do at
this stage is to sign this form.

1407
02:02:43,671 --> 02:02:46,003
Think carefully
before you decide.

1408
02:02:46,108 --> 02:02:48,837
Looking ahead in financial
matters is always a wise course.

1409
02:02:56,851 --> 02:03:00,447
Sam, what are we going
to do with you?

1410
02:03:02,524 --> 02:03:04,492
Where is Jill?

1411
02:03:06,194 --> 02:03:08,253
I've got to find her.

1412
02:03:08,363 --> 02:03:11,595
Please. Please, you've got
to get me out of here.

1413
02:03:11,699 --> 02:03:15,226
I understand, Sam. I know
exactly how you feel.

1414
02:03:15,337 --> 02:03:18,828
So I've brought you a
bottle of barley water.

1415
02:03:18,940 --> 02:03:21,603
Oh, please help me.

1416
02:03:21,710 --> 02:03:25,110
I assure you, Sam, I'm doing
everything within my power.

1417
02:03:25,213 --> 02:03:28,149
But the rules of the
game are laid down.

1418
02:03:28,250 --> 02:03:31,219
We all have to play by them.
Even me.

1419
02:03:32,387 --> 02:03:36,551
It's all a mistake. You've
got to understand that.

1420
02:03:36,658 --> 02:03:39,331
Yes, well,
from the department's point of view,

1421
02:03:39,355 --> 02:03:41,916
you're certainly a bit
of an own goal, but...

1422
02:03:41,997 --> 02:03:44,658
I'm not a terrorist.

1423
02:03:44,766 --> 02:03:47,667
You must know that. Please,
please get me out of here.

1424
02:03:47,770 --> 02:03:51,228
Sam, information
retrieval is expensive.

1425
02:03:51,340 --> 02:03:54,274
You're running up an enormous
bill by not cooperating.

1426
02:03:54,376 --> 02:03:56,537
Please.

1427
02:03:56,645 --> 02:03:59,613
Please, Mr. Helpmann.

1428
02:03:59,715 --> 02:04:01,682
Help me find Jill.

1429
02:04:03,152 --> 02:04:05,051
Jill.

1430
02:04:05,154 --> 02:04:07,145
Yes.

1431
02:04:07,256 --> 02:04:10,487
Sam, I think I
ought to tell you.

1432
02:04:10,591 --> 02:04:15,188
I'm afraid she's upped stumps
and retired to the pavilion.

1433
02:04:17,032 --> 02:04:19,000
<i>Thrown in the towel.</i>

1434
02:04:20,202 --> 02:04:22,101
Dead?

1435
02:04:22,203 --> 02:04:24,296
Yes.

1436
02:04:24,405 --> 02:04:27,375
It's all a bit confusing, but
it seems she was killed...

1437
02:04:27,475 --> 02:04:29,444
resisting arrest.

1438
02:04:32,480 --> 02:04:35,472
No. It's all right.

1439
02:04:35,583 --> 02:04:37,551
I did that.

1440
02:04:40,221 --> 02:04:43,122
The odd thing is, it appears
to have happened twice.

1441
02:04:43,225 --> 02:04:45,420
Bit of a disputed
call, I'm afraid.

1442
02:04:48,029 --> 02:04:49,997
Twice?

1443
02:04:50,099 --> 02:04:51,998
So, there you are.

1444
02:04:52,100 --> 02:04:56,868
All I can say is, don't fall at the last
fence, the finishing post in sight.

1445
02:04:56,971 --> 02:04:58,872
See you in the paddock.

1446
02:04:58,974 --> 02:05:01,373
Do cooperate. Think
of your mother.

1447
02:05:01,476 --> 02:05:03,877
Good luck. Keep your
eye on the ball.

1448
02:05:03,979 --> 02:05:07,380
Gotta go. Can't keep
the orphans waiting.

1449
02:05:35,511 --> 02:05:37,604
Don't fight it, son.

1450
02:05:37,712 --> 02:05:39,771
Confess quickly.

1451
02:05:40,916 --> 02:05:44,078
If you hold out too long, you could
jeopardize your credit rating.

1452
02:05:55,997 --> 02:05:57,898
695/6.

1453
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,729
Thank you.

1454
02:06:34,368 --> 02:06:36,632
Jack?

1455
02:06:41,844 --> 02:06:43,936
Jack.

1456
02:06:44,046 --> 02:06:46,139
Jack. Jack!

1457
02:06:46,247 --> 02:06:48,148
Shut up.

1458
02:06:48,250 --> 02:06:51,447
Jack. Jack, I'm innocent.
Please.

1459
02:06:51,552 --> 02:06:53,817
-Help me.
-Bastard.

1460
02:06:55,056 --> 02:06:56,752
Jack.

1461
02:06:56,859 --> 02:06:59,555
Jack, this is all a mistake.
Please, Jack.

1462
02:06:59,661 --> 02:07:01,628
Take that mask off.

1463
02:07:06,801 --> 02:07:08,770
You stupid bastard.

1464
02:07:10,037 --> 02:07:12,471
-Jack.
-How could you do this to me?

1465
02:07:12,573 --> 02:07:14,474
Jack, I'm frightened.

1466
02:07:14,576 --> 02:07:16,805
How do you think I
feel, you shit?

1467
02:07:16,912 --> 02:07:18,880
-Jack...
-Shut up!

1468
02:07:23,385 --> 02:07:27,719
This is a professional
relationship.

1469
02:07:28,823 --> 02:07:30,724
Jack.

1470
02:07:30,826 --> 02:07:34,023
Jack, no, you can't.

1471
02:07:34,128 --> 02:07:36,689
No, Jack, please.

1472
02:07:36,797 --> 02:07:38,890
<i>Jack, no! Don't!</i>

1473
02:07:39,001 --> 02:07:41,469
<i>Please, Jack! No!</i>

1474
02:08:26,547 --> 02:08:29,539
-You okay?
-Tuttle!

1475
02:08:29,650 --> 02:08:31,618
Call me Harry.

1476
02:09:19,234 --> 02:09:21,532
Let's go!

1477
02:09:52,100 --> 02:09:53,533
Here. Here.

1478
02:14:30,779 --> 02:14:34,613
Ah, Mr. Lowry. So pleased
you could make it.

1479
02:14:34,716 --> 02:14:36,979
Right this way.

1480
02:14:41,488 --> 02:14:43,457
It's a sad loss.

1481
02:14:43,557 --> 02:14:46,253
<i>Your mother was with
her at the end.</i>

1482
02:14:46,360 --> 02:14:50,592
<i>The gift of eternal life.</i>

1483
02:14:50,698 --> 02:14:55,829
Mrs. Terrain has just received
that most wonderful of gifts.

1484
02:14:55,936 --> 02:14:58,234
<i>She came to us physically new.</i>

1485
02:14:58,340 --> 02:15:02,400
<i>She goes hence from us
not so physically new.</i>

1486
02:15:02,510 --> 02:15:04,409
But the spirit never grows old.

1487
02:15:04,511 --> 02:15:07,605
Madame Lowry.

1488
02:15:11,953 --> 02:15:13,921
Mother.

1489
02:15:15,222 --> 02:15:17,122
Oh. Sam.

1490
02:15:17,225 --> 02:15:19,693
Mother. Mother!

1491
02:15:21,863 --> 02:15:24,092
Stop calling me that.

1492
02:15:25,132 --> 02:15:28,533
Mother! Mother, please!

1493
02:15:28,636 --> 02:15:32,002
-Is this guy bothering you?
-Oh. Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

1494
02:15:32,106 --> 02:15:34,939
Mother!

1495
02:15:35,042 --> 02:15:39,104
Go away. This is a
very sacred moment.

1496
02:18:48,636 --> 02:18:50,797
He's got away from us, Jack.

1497
02:18:50,905 --> 02:18:53,202
Afraid you're
right, Mr. Helpmann.

1498
02:18:53,308 --> 02:18:55,868
He's gone.

1499
02:18:58,513 --> 02:19:00,480
Well...

1500
02:19:32,245 --> 02:19:35,112
<i># Then #</i>

1501
02:19:35,216 --> 02:19:40,585
