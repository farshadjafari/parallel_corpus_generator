1
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:20,482
- Gisela, I have to leave
- What are you leaving for?

2
00:01:33,324 --> 00:01:35,554
- Gisela
- Oh, I see

3
00:01:36,444 --> 00:01:37,763
Come on, let's go

4
00:01:44,364 --> 00:01:47,083
- Ok, meet you at the English park tomorrow noon at twelve
- in front the cabin by the lake?

5
00:01:47,164 --> 00:01:51,282
- Yes, Hans really should give me a phone call
- I'll remind him

6
00:01:51,364 --> 00:01:55,596
- Has he calm down now?
- You shouldn't have yelled at him

7
00:01:57,044 --> 00:01:59,239
Everything will be fine

8
00:02:35,684 --> 00:02:40,633
Finally, you should have arrived earlier
Hurry, let's go

9
00:02:44,844 --> 00:02:48,042
- Is this all?
- the rest has not arrived yet

10
00:03:01,725 --> 00:03:05,434
"German people are shocked by soldiers who
fell into the abyss of death at Stalingrad

11
00:03:05,525 --> 00:03:09,723
330,000 fellowmen are forced to
death and extermination step by step

12
00:03:09,805 --> 00:03:12,922
by the great strategies of our strategists
meaninglessly and irresponsibly

13
00:03:13,005 --> 00:03:16,918
Little Sophielein, if you can help Willi
he must be very happy

14
00:03:42,205 --> 00:03:46,244
This is the stamp, and this is the address

15
00:03:47,445 --> 00:03:48,719
Thanks

16
00:03:58,725 --> 00:04:00,522
What to do with the rest?

17
00:04:11,245 --> 00:04:13,554
I'll go deliver them at the college tomorrow

18
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:22,156
- Are you crazy?
- Willi, did you forget the female college students demonstrating at the Germany Museum a few days ago?

19
00:04:22,245 --> 00:04:26,033
- almost succeed
- Gestapo have been in the first ground alert for this

20
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,844
- Hans...
- Don't forget our slogans are everywhere

21
00:04:28,925 --> 00:04:31,519
Hans, before we have any new envelopes
we can hide the rest under the board

22
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,073
No need. There is nothing left.
Lack of paper

23
00:04:34,165 --> 00:04:37,601
It's already pretty dangerous
to write slogans on walls at night

24
00:04:38,165 --> 00:04:41,714
But compare with giving out flyers at
campus in the day time... Do you want to die?

25
00:04:41,805 --> 00:04:44,922
We have to make our best efforts, cannot
wait anymore Let's bring along the whole city!

26
00:04:45,005 --> 00:04:47,838
It's the most tense moment of the Stalingrad warfare
now. Nazi's secret agents are all over the campus!

27
00:04:47,925 --> 00:04:49,563
If bolshevists come now,
just to kill them all...

28
00:04:49,645 --> 00:04:51,840
- At least we can kill them once for all
- If I were you

29
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:54,234
I won't hope Soviet Union
comes before Americans

30
00:04:54,525 --> 00:04:59,758
Don't you hate bolshevist the most?
Hans, are you crazy?

31
00:05:00,165 --> 00:05:01,883
Don't go to deliver them in colleges!

32
00:05:02,325 --> 00:05:04,634
I'll go when they are having classes,
nobody will be in the hall...

33
00:05:04,725 --> 00:05:07,444
I'll come out soon, entering from
the front gate and get out from the back one

34
00:05:07,525 --> 00:05:10,039
- It's too dangerous!
- Willi...

35
00:05:10,725 --> 00:05:12,841
I will take all the responsibility
if anything happens.

36
00:05:14,325 --> 00:05:15,644
Won't embroil others

37
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,719
You are going to walk through Schwabing
with a big suitcase?

38
00:05:21,805 --> 00:05:23,204
Let's me take this

39
00:05:25,245 --> 00:05:27,156
Hans, I don't think
we should embroil Sophie in this...

40
00:05:27,245 --> 00:05:29,918
If we were to be checked,
it would be easier for a woman to pass

41
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:34,157
She is right

42
00:05:36,605 --> 00:05:39,438
Alright, let's go

43
00:05:52,326 --> 00:05:54,123
Alex, meet me in my place at twelve tomorrow

44
00:05:59,046 --> 00:06:02,482
- Starting from tomorrow, no wait?
- We can wait, but Nazis won't

45
00:06:37,486 --> 00:06:38,680
Thanks

46
00:06:41,606 --> 00:06:43,278
Don't work too late

47
00:06:43,366 --> 00:06:45,402
- Goodnight
- Goodnight

48
00:07:15,966 --> 00:07:20,403
Dear Lisa,
I'm listening to Schubert's Trout Quintet

49
00:07:20,486 --> 00:07:24,604
I feel Schubert’s inspiration
is flowing in air

50
00:07:24,886 --> 00:07:29,243
I can hear the happy tweedle of birds
and little creatures

51
00:07:29,726 --> 00:07:34,038
The piano constantly repeats the same thematic
rhythm just like a clear, crystal creek

52
00:07:35,286 --> 00:07:39,802
oh, they make me so enchanted
Wish I can hear from you soon

53
00:07:40,686 --> 00:07:43,154
Best wishes, yours Sophie

54
00:08:03,966 --> 00:08:08,244
Not sure if mom still have some jam?
This brand they only sell turnip juice now

55
00:08:16,606 --> 00:08:18,278
Not conspicuous enough, right?

56
00:08:27,486 --> 00:08:30,398
- We bring the light of hope into colleges today
- Yes

57
00:09:52,887 --> 00:09:54,081
Good morning!

58
00:09:54,847 --> 00:09:58,522
- Good morning
- We are going to a neurology hospital, you want to come along?

59
00:09:59,047 --> 00:10:02,323
- Sophie is going to Ulm by bus. I will be there soon
- Hurry up

60
00:12:00,088 --> 00:12:04,559
Hurry, hurry up

61
00:12:10,528 --> 00:12:13,042
- There are some in the case, Hans
- What?

62
00:12:19,168 --> 00:12:22,001
- No one is up there, wait a second
- I'm going with you

63
00:13:16,048 --> 00:13:18,039
Freeze! Stop!

64
00:13:19,928 --> 00:13:24,319
Stop right now!
You... don't run... stop!

65
00:13:24,448 --> 00:13:28,521
- You are under arrested! Stop, damned
- What's wrong?

66
00:13:28,648 --> 00:13:31,924
- You are under arrested!
- Ridiculous, how can you arrest us randomly!

67
00:13:32,048 --> 00:13:35,324
- You are the only people upstairs, come with me
- We were coming out from the Department of Psychology

68
00:13:35,408 --> 00:13:37,683
- You are handing out fly sheets
- Nonsense

69
00:13:37,768 --> 00:13:41,681
Let go of him,
it's me taking off those sheets

70
00:13:41,768 --> 00:13:46,558
Good you admit that. I'm going to report you
You come with me, both of you!

71
00:13:47,808 --> 00:13:52,006
Believe me, even in my college you cannot
get away if you are doing that

72
00:13:53,008 --> 00:13:54,919
"German people are shocked
by soldiers at Stalingrad... "

73
00:13:55,008 --> 00:13:57,317
Come in!

74
00:14:04,128 --> 00:14:06,483
So many? Unbelievable!

75
00:14:06,568 --> 00:14:08,081
- They are all here?
- Yes!

76
00:14:08,328 --> 00:14:09,477
You can go now!

77
00:14:09,688 --> 00:14:11,997
Schmid, write a report

78
00:14:13,128 --> 00:14:15,562
We will catch them all

79
00:14:16,528 --> 00:14:19,964
There... there This college student
seems to have something in his hands...

80
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:24,918
Quick, give it to me!
Look, there is one more fly sheet

81
00:14:25,008 --> 00:14:27,966
Give it to me!
Or you want me to do it myself?

82
00:14:38,048 --> 00:14:41,120
They should be put together

83
00:14:49,568 --> 00:14:52,925
- I'm Mohr, national police. Long live Hitler
- Long live Hitler

84
00:14:53,049 --> 00:14:55,244
This two, they are under arrested for now...

85
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:58,878
- These are the documents I took over
- It's me took these two guys...

86
00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:11,565
Do you have any ID?

87
00:15:34,609 --> 00:15:37,965
- Ms. Sophia Magdalena Scholl?
- Yes

88
00:15:40,289 --> 00:15:43,406
- Mr. Hans Fritz Scholl?
- Yes

89
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:46,044
- Brother and sister?
- Yes

90
00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:50,158
Female

91
00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:54,326
21 years old...

92
00:15:57,569 --> 00:15:59,844
so, you want to resist Reich that...

93
00:15:59,969 --> 00:16:01,766
has already taken the whole Europe?

94
00:16:01,849 --> 00:16:05,125
when the guy noticed be watched by me
he started ripping the paper in hands

95
00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:07,769
an unacquainted classmate
handed it over to me forcedly

96
00:16:07,849 --> 00:16:10,443
I ripped it 'cause I don't want
to bring any trouble

97
00:16:13,729 --> 00:16:16,641
- Is this your case?
- yes, it's mine

98
00:16:18,369 --> 00:16:19,722
Take it!

99
00:16:25,329 --> 00:16:29,402
I've given the order to close off the college

100
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:32,806
any teachers and other personnel
shall not leave the school

101
00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:35,528
Sure! certainly I will stay too

102
00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:50,842
- go back and tell Alex to leave me alone
- Quiet!

103
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:13,082
Scholl, Hanz, get in the room
to Maller for inquest

104
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,567
follow me, madam!

105
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,523
come here please!

106
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:24,082
unlock cuff!

107
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:26,924
Thanks

108
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:16,803
Let's begin

109
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,729
sit down

110
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:44,643
Sophia Magdalena Scholl, from Ulm

111
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:48,686
born on May 9, 1992 in Forchtenberg

112
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,921
Christian, and your father?

113
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:55,527
Robert Scholl, mayor of Forchtenberg

114
00:19:55,650 --> 00:20:00,041
- any professional nursery education before?
- yes, I have

115
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:04,569
currently live in Munich,
NO 13 Franz-Joseph ST.

116
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:07,244
- landlord's name is Smith?
- yes

117
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:10,049
- any criminal record?
- none

118
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:14,118
you have admitted right in front of the
dorm administrator that it was you...

119
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:17,600
who spreaded the fly sheets from balustrade

120
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,760
the fly sheets were on the marble handrail

121
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:22,684
I spreaded them casually
when I was passing by

122
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,364
why?

123
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,759
it's my nature, see anything,
move anything... that's it

124
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:31,087
I admitted it then and there
and I knew...

125
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:34,526
I made a stupid mistake

126
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:38,928
I am very regretted,
but things can not be changed anyhow

127
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:45,130
Miss Scholl,
you spreaded fly sheets in college

128
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,963
and it has violated
Kriegssonderstrafrechtsverordnung

129
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:51,884
do you want to know the punishment for
quislism and collaborationism?

130
00:20:54,531 --> 00:20:59,321
- it has nothing to do with me
- imprisonment, labor reform...

131
00:20:59,731 --> 00:21:03,360
- or execution
- it has nothing to do with me, definitely

132
00:21:21,411 --> 00:21:24,881
- cigarettes?
- no, thanks

133
00:21:26,131 --> 00:21:29,885
- but you do smoke, right?
- occasionally

134
00:22:00,931 --> 00:22:02,842
perfect for this situation

135
00:22:04,251 --> 00:22:05,650
just coincidence

136
00:22:13,691 --> 00:22:16,842
why did you bring an empty case to school?

137
00:22:17,411 --> 00:22:19,686
I planed to go to Ulm by car
pick up my clothes in house

138
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:23,480
- the clothes were taken home for washing by my mother
- back to Ulm?

139
00:22:23,571 --> 00:22:26,881
it's not weekend now
you want to take that long trip back home?

140
00:22:27,331 --> 00:22:29,526
- yes
- just for some clothes?

141
00:22:31,651 --> 00:22:35,166
not only for the clothes, I also want
to visit a friend she just had a baby

142
00:22:36,091 --> 00:22:39,322
- and, my mother was sick
- why didn't you wait till weekend?

143
00:22:39,411 --> 00:22:42,608
so you skipped classes?
why did you go home so hurry?

144
00:22:42,971 --> 00:22:45,724
because my friend suggested going to Hamburg

145
00:22:45,811 --> 00:22:47,608
so I want to get back before weekend

146
00:22:48,611 --> 00:22:51,728
I planed to take 12:48 train

147
00:22:54,051 --> 00:22:56,519
and I already made the appointment with
my sister's friend in Heltz Station

148
00:22:56,611 --> 00:22:58,329
you can ask him

149
00:23:01,251 --> 00:23:03,640
- his name?
- Otto Aicher

150
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:10,803
he started from Solln
and reached Munich at 12... 11:30

151
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:13,564
- Aicher, start with an "e"?
- start with "a - i"

152
00:23:16,411 --> 00:23:18,800
you didn't put clothes
in the case to Ulm for washing?

153
00:23:19,451 --> 00:23:22,124
no, I wash my own small clothes

154
00:23:22,251 --> 00:23:24,719
as for the big ones,
no one is needed for washing yet

155
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:33,921
so, it means you don't need clean clothes yet?

156
00:23:34,691 --> 00:23:36,647
but just now you were saying...

157
00:23:36,731 --> 00:23:39,803
you expressly bring an empty case to home
for washed clothes?

158
00:23:39,891 --> 00:23:43,201
I was thinking that since I went back to Ulm
I should bring next week's clothes too

159
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:48,886
so you want to go back to Ulm
why did you still come back to school?

160
00:23:49,131 --> 00:23:52,646
I had an appointment with a friend
her name is Gisela Schertling

161
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:56,202
we planed to have lunch together in the
cabin at British park lakeside at 12 noon

162
00:23:56,292 --> 00:23:58,408
didn't you go to Ulm?

163
00:24:00,492 --> 00:24:02,767
I decided that today temporarily

164
00:24:02,852 --> 00:24:05,844
I came back to school
to cancel the appointment with Gisela

165
00:24:36,212 --> 00:24:39,602
why did your brother accompany you to the school?

166
00:24:40,052 --> 00:24:42,646
didn't you just come to cancel the appointment?

167
00:24:42,812 --> 00:24:46,851
Hanz and I often go to school together
Hanz wants to go to neurosurgery school

168
00:24:49,892 --> 00:24:53,771
dorm administrator said, about 11 o'clock
you two were on aisle of the third floor

169
00:24:54,612 --> 00:24:58,241
- what were you doing?
- we were on the way searching for Gisela

170
00:24:58,332 --> 00:25:02,211
she was in Pro. Huber's philosophy class

171
00:25:02,532 --> 00:25:06,241
- but that was on 2nd floor
- yes, we were there 10 minutes early

172
00:25:06,332 --> 00:25:09,130
so I took my brother
to psychology department for a look

173
00:25:09,252 --> 00:25:12,927
most of my classes are in 3rd floor,
psychology department

174
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:15,128
where did you see the fly sheets?

175
00:25:15,412 --> 00:25:18,165
you mean the paper? everywhere

176
00:25:18,252 --> 00:25:21,528
- and you did not even take a look and see what it written?
- yes, I did, but only a glance

177
00:25:23,292 --> 00:25:26,443
- my brother told a joke about this
- a political joke?

178
00:25:26,532 --> 00:25:31,845
no, he said it wastes paper, he is
just like me not interested in politics

179
00:25:40,052 --> 00:25:43,522
several days ago, when a district
principal gave speech in Germany Museum

180
00:25:43,612 --> 00:25:45,523
a bunch of female college students made trouble

181
00:25:46,532 --> 00:25:48,045
were you there?

182
00:25:48,572 --> 00:25:49,846
No

183
00:25:50,172 --> 00:25:54,688
- everybody should be there while in the speech
- I don't attend any politics

184
00:25:54,932 --> 00:25:57,321
what do you think of the speech
given by district principal

185
00:25:57,452 --> 00:25:59,727
as he mentioned...

186
00:26:00,052 --> 00:26:02,441
girls should think about
how to give birth for leaders

187
00:26:02,532 --> 00:26:06,047
while not fooling around in college

188
00:26:06,172 --> 00:26:09,881
He said the ugly one
can marry to his adjutant

189
00:26:11,052 --> 00:26:12,690
This is a taste problem

190
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:19,125
What you did in university

191
00:26:19,212 --> 00:26:22,443
Already make you a suspect,
I seriously advise you

192
00:26:22,532 --> 00:26:26,161
Don't be hesitate any more
to tell the truth

193
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:30,728
I deny that I have any connection
with this leaflet

194
00:26:30,852 --> 00:26:35,130
Except the joke I made,
I understand that

195
00:26:35,252 --> 00:26:37,891
The suspicion for us
before you finds the real wrongdoers.

196
00:26:37,972 --> 00:26:42,727
- But my brother and I has nothing to do with this
- Do you really think?

197
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:46,288
You can hide it before me when answer
the question? What do you think?

198
00:26:47,532 --> 00:26:49,727
All I told you are truth

199
00:27:29,053 --> 00:27:31,692
Mrs. Scholl, my co-worker did not

200
00:27:31,813 --> 00:27:35,772
Find anything leaflet in that case, you
brother's Confession also proved what you said

201
00:27:40,253 --> 00:27:41,481
You can relax now

202
00:27:42,653 --> 00:27:44,723
I never worried

203
00:27:49,653 --> 00:27:51,644
Let the recorder come in

204
00:27:54,853 --> 00:27:57,970
I will let her to record my statement
You have to listen carefully

205
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:01,847
If there is any conflict with your affidavit
You must tell me right away

206
00:28:02,133 --> 00:28:05,170
- Are you clear, Mrs. Scholl?
- Yes

207
00:28:05,293 --> 00:28:08,171
Although this will be kept
in your criminal record

208
00:28:08,293 --> 00:28:10,682
But, we will see

209
00:28:11,253 --> 00:28:15,371
Maybe you still can go to Ulm
according to the plan

210
00:28:19,373 --> 00:28:20,203
It is over

211
00:28:30,733 --> 00:28:33,293
Metternich! Retirement certificate
Hail Hitler

212
00:28:33,413 --> 00:28:34,926
Mr. Sch¨¹rmer, follow me

213
00:28:41,893 --> 00:28:44,851
You students think you can be here

214
00:28:44,933 --> 00:28:46,252
Fool us?

215
00:28:46,413 --> 00:28:50,452
Please hand out your jewellery, watch

216
00:28:50,533 --> 00:28:53,331
We already made up our mind to
Use our lives to resist

217
00:28:53,453 --> 00:28:58,322
Do not consider the world surrounding us

218
00:28:58,453 --> 00:29:01,126
- No matter understand the necessity of this war or not
- Necklace and pendant

219
00:29:02,053 --> 00:29:06,683
The time for a full scale war already comes

220
00:29:06,813 --> 00:29:10,283
Follow me

221
00:29:12,093 --> 00:29:16,132
Let us say farewell to fear
and meaningless hesitation

222
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:18,249
In this fight with fate

223
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:21,131
Abide our rule: clean my leather coat
But do not make me wet!

224
00:29:21,213 --> 00:29:24,603
(Means the law deprive citizen's right for consultation in 1935)
- Please take off you cloth and give it to me

225
00:29:32,653 --> 00:29:34,530
It is great danger

226
00:29:34,653 --> 00:29:37,645
We must put into huge effort

227
00:29:37,733 --> 00:29:41,282
If you still have any illegal stuff, give it me
I help you throw them in to toilet

228
00:29:41,693 --> 00:29:44,890
I am also a prisoner
Now, that time is coming

229
00:29:45,013 --> 00:29:46,685
I have nothing

230
00:29:47,093 --> 00:29:50,085
Please take off your gloves

231
00:30:04,534 --> 00:30:07,128
OK, let's continue

232
00:30:07,214 --> 00:30:10,445
Tomorrow will knee down
to thank us our acceptance for him

233
00:30:11,374 --> 00:30:14,446
Ladies, get in, hurry, hurry,
I want to listen to the lecture

234
00:30:36,854 --> 00:30:38,890
Do you know how my brother is now?

235
00:30:39,014 --> 00:30:41,892
Your brother already had it
He is waiting with other men up there

236
00:30:42,014 --> 00:30:44,687
You are the main suspect
Because you have the case

237
00:30:44,814 --> 00:30:49,046
Leaflets are threw down by your too
Do not admit anything!

238
00:30:49,374 --> 00:30:51,365
I admitted nothing

239
00:30:59,734 --> 00:31:03,409
How long have you been here?
One year and five days

240
00:31:03,734 --> 00:31:07,727
They caught one of my letters, I quoted
Words that Ludwig-Thoma criticizes Hitler

241
00:31:08,654 --> 00:31:12,203
- Even though, you still work for those people
- They order me to do this

242
00:31:15,334 --> 00:31:17,768
The reason why I am here
Is to prevent you to commit suicide

243
00:31:27,654 --> 00:31:30,885
- Why are you again Nazi?
- My brother and I are communist

244
00:31:30,974 --> 00:31:33,124
Even my brother has a very
senior position in an insurance company

245
00:31:33,254 --> 00:31:35,848
I admire the selfless help in communist party

246
00:31:35,934 --> 00:31:37,652
People have to do something

247
00:31:50,614 --> 00:31:52,684
Scholl Sophia, go with me!

248
00:31:54,494 --> 00:31:59,204
I hope, we never see each other, good luck!
You too, good luck!

249
00:32:07,854 --> 00:32:09,253
Wait here

250
00:32:15,254 --> 00:32:19,725
OK, Mrs., your release paper
You are lucky this time

251
00:32:46,614 --> 00:32:47,888
Please speak up

252
00:32:52,214 --> 00:32:53,408
Understood

253
00:32:54,894 --> 00:32:56,965
Follow me, follow me

254
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:07,366
You can take off your coat

255
00:33:19,975 --> 00:33:21,488
Sit down

256
00:33:34,735 --> 00:33:37,966
Your father was put into jail for 6 weeks
Because you call our leader is

257
00:33:38,095 --> 00:33:40,563
God's punishment for human being

258
00:33:41,575 --> 00:33:44,043
He was arrested for the crime of conspiracy

259
00:33:44,375 --> 00:33:47,094
Also his license was revoked too

260
00:33:47,855 --> 00:33:51,450
I want to know. You join Hitler Jugend

261
00:33:52,135 --> 00:33:54,490
What do you dad think about that?

262
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:57,288
My dad never influence
our political preference

263
00:33:58,575 --> 00:34:04,366
Typical democrat
Why do you join Hitler Jugend?

264
00:34:04,495 --> 00:34:06,850
Because I heard that
Hitler will bring our nation glory

265
00:34:06,975 --> 00:34:11,173
Good luck and fortune,
everyone will have job and bread

266
00:34:11,295 --> 00:34:14,014
Everybody will enjoy freedom and happiness

267
00:34:20,535 --> 00:34:24,244
- You are single?
- I am engaged

268
00:34:24,895 --> 00:34:29,571
With Fritz Hartnagel
He is a commander of eastern front

269
00:34:30,415 --> 00:34:34,010
Stalingrad?
Yes

270
00:34:34,135 --> 00:34:39,493
- When was the last time you see each other?
- Half year ago

271
00:35:14,775 --> 00:35:16,572
Have you seen this gun before?

272
00:35:18,455 --> 00:35:22,334
My brother had a gun like this
He was sergeant in army

273
00:35:22,455 --> 00:35:25,333
Why do you have 190 bullets in your drawer?

274
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:29,249
9mm bullets?
They are also my brother's

275
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:32,447
When was the last time you buy stamps?

276
00:35:34,335 --> 00:35:37,133
- About two week ago
- Where did you buy, and how many did you buy?

277
00:35:38,255 --> 00:35:40,894
Leopoldstrasse street, post office 23

278
00:35:41,615 --> 00:35:45,528
Ten 12 cents and five 6 cents
I can't remember exactly

279
00:35:45,655 --> 00:35:48,089
- Only those, you did not buy more?
- No

280
00:35:58,216 --> 00:36:00,093
Have you seen these stamps?

281
00:36:04,456 --> 00:36:05,650
No

282
00:36:06,336 --> 00:36:09,373
- Are you sure you never seen them?
- Never

283
00:36:12,016 --> 00:36:14,849
This was what we found in your brother's room

284
00:36:21,576 --> 00:36:23,726
Why did you never mention...

285
00:36:23,856 --> 00:36:26,131
Your brother has a lot stamps?

286
00:36:26,256 --> 00:36:28,895
Your question is when and where
I bought stamps recently

287
00:36:29,016 --> 00:36:33,328
one hundred and forty?
who needs that many of stamps? for what?

288
00:36:33,456 --> 00:36:36,254
what you need to send out?

289
00:36:36,456 --> 00:36:38,526
compliment to friends and relative,
we are in touch.

290
00:36:38,616 --> 00:36:41,369
- so, your have seen those stamps?
- I am just guessing.

291
00:36:41,496 --> 00:36:44,647
you found those from
my brother's place, not mine

292
00:36:59,296 --> 00:37:01,127
is this your typewriter?

293
00:37:01,536 --> 00:37:03,766
it was in my brother's room,
we borrowed it from landlord.

294
00:37:03,896 --> 00:37:06,729
- she lent to us to type something.
- what thing?

295
00:37:06,856 --> 00:37:09,893
An essay about philosophy and theology

296
00:37:18,816 --> 00:37:22,252
- not for typing those handbills?
- No

297
00:37:23,416 --> 00:37:26,931
An essay about philosophy and theology?
something like...

298
00:37:28,456 --> 00:37:32,051
"Hitler could not win this war,
only keep it going"

299
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:36,728
or "a criminal cannot give Germany victory"

300
00:37:37,856 --> 00:37:42,168
or "federation is the future of Germany,

301
00:37:42,296 --> 00:37:45,652
freedom of speech, freedom of religion"

302
00:37:49,456 --> 00:37:51,526
Hans didn’t write those

303
00:37:54,656 --> 00:37:56,692
- You wrote those?
- No

304
00:37:57,296 --> 00:38:01,255
- but you believe this kind of world order
- I don't care about politics, and I won't

305
00:38:03,296 --> 00:38:06,015
anyway, we compared all those writing,
and all those bullshit

306
00:38:06,136 --> 00:38:09,253
are done by this typewriter,
then at the beginning of this month,

307
00:38:09,376 --> 00:38:13,369
they are sent to different addresses,
include Munich

308
00:38:14,136 --> 00:38:16,013
I have no idea about this

309
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:28,089
sit there!
watch it!

310
00:38:46,696 --> 00:38:49,847
all those bullshit were from your
brother's place and your were there

311
00:38:49,976 --> 00:38:51,853
and he was planning to destroy all those bills

312
00:39:01,337 --> 00:39:03,248
Have you seen those paper before?

313
00:39:04,577 --> 00:39:08,047
- No
- keep your lie, but read this for me.

314
00:39:12,057 --> 00:39:15,447
"two hundred thousands German died...

315
00:39:15,537 --> 00:39:19,052
- just for one war opportunist"
- Does this remind you something?

316
00:39:19,137 --> 00:39:22,971
Is it similar to other six handbills?

317
00:39:24,177 --> 00:39:25,769
Take look at the handwriting

318
00:39:27,217 --> 00:39:29,811
- I don’t know
- Listen to me!

319
00:39:30,817 --> 00:39:33,889
this part of evil speaking comes from
a guy named Christoph Probst

320
00:39:34,017 --> 00:39:37,566
He is a friend of your at Innsbruck.
We found his letter.

321
00:39:37,697 --> 00:39:39,574
Exactly same handwriting!

322
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:45,330
Probst is also a student in astrology

323
00:39:47,857 --> 00:39:52,806
love family and mountains of motherland.

324
00:39:52,937 --> 00:39:58,091
An other do oneself proud bastard
Never understand people are dying at battlefront.

325
00:40:02,697 --> 00:40:04,892
who is in, beside you,
your brother and that Christoph Probst.

326
00:40:04,977 --> 00:40:07,445
- who did those bills?
- please stop slandering me?

327
00:40:07,577 --> 00:40:11,126
You held back all those evidence from your home

328
00:40:11,257 --> 00:40:14,966
Even I asked you to give me the truth

329
00:40:15,097 --> 00:40:17,008
I just admit what I really did

330
00:40:24,097 --> 00:40:28,010
how about listen this,
your brother, was just like you,

331
00:40:28,617 --> 00:40:30,892
how to explain those evidence

332
00:40:34,137 --> 00:40:36,776
"the military plan failed at eastern line...

333
00:40:36,897 --> 00:40:40,253
U.S.A and British military force
increased unpredictability.

334
00:40:40,377 --> 00:40:44,086
I concluded that we could not win this war

335
00:40:44,217 --> 00:40:48,574
after painfully thinking in long time...

336
00:40:48,697 --> 00:40:52,292
I believe that avoiding
the meaningless death...

337
00:40:52,417 --> 00:40:57,013
and keeping the integrality of Europe

338
00:40:57,137 --> 00:41:02,211
the only way is finish the war
as soon as possible, in the other hand,...

339
00:41:02,337 --> 00:41:06,569
I also have deep fear about the way we treat
the occupation area and people in the area"

340
00:41:08,577 --> 00:41:12,286
that is just his political point,
not exculpation to your slander

341
00:41:12,417 --> 00:41:13,486
this is...

342
00:41:14,617 --> 00:41:17,415
...disorganizing army
and betraying our country!

343
00:41:19,337 --> 00:41:21,646
I don’t believe my brother said that!

344
00:41:21,777 --> 00:41:25,929
So you think your brother was lying to us?

345
00:41:26,057 --> 00:41:28,617
Before my brother talk to me personally,

346
00:41:28,697 --> 00:41:30,415
I won't believe that he said those

347
00:41:31,057 --> 00:41:34,288
Eickemayer Studio
you heard about it?

348
00:41:35,697 --> 00:41:36,971
Yes

349
00:41:37,977 --> 00:41:42,016
Eickemayer is at Krakau in recent few months,
he gave the key...

350
00:41:42,137 --> 00:41:45,334
of studio to us, let us take a look

351
00:41:46,457 --> 00:41:48,971
the fingerprint on the copymachine...

352
00:41:49,057 --> 00:41:50,775
they are your brother's

353
00:41:56,977 --> 00:41:58,854
your brother has admitted

354
00:42:01,938 --> 00:42:05,328
he designed,

355
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:13,769
copyed and handed out
all six kinds of handbills.

356
00:42:15,938 --> 00:42:19,453
He tried to make me believe that, he sent out
five thousand handbills in Munich at one night

357
00:42:30,498 --> 00:42:32,648
you lived with your brother

358
00:42:32,738 --> 00:42:36,526
you were all in the hallway this morning

359
00:42:36,658 --> 00:42:39,934
and you still want me believe
that you have nothing to do with this?

360
00:42:40,378 --> 00:42:43,495
you think all these slander
are meaningless? Just admit it!

361
00:42:43,618 --> 00:42:47,975
You and your brother made
and sent those handbills!

362
00:42:56,258 --> 00:42:58,931
YES! and I am proud of it!

363
00:43:06,538 --> 00:43:08,847
what will happen to me and my brother?

364
00:43:08,978 --> 00:43:11,890
You should think about
this at beginning Miss Scholl

365
00:43:14,138 --> 00:43:17,448
- Our relative will be embroiled?
- I can't decide it

366
00:43:22,818 --> 00:43:26,333
- I have to go to washroom
- Not now!

367
00:43:26,818 --> 00:43:28,888
Who draft out these?

368
00:43:29,938 --> 00:43:33,169
- Me!
- You are lying Miss Scholl! Just few weeks ago...

369
00:43:33,298 --> 00:43:35,687
we did the writing check

370
00:43:35,818 --> 00:43:39,697
from the report,
we are sure they are from a male.

371
00:43:39,818 --> 00:43:42,286
Your brother is the author and the planner!

372
00:43:45,738 --> 00:43:49,777
- who mailed out these handbills?
- my brother and I

373
00:43:57,698 --> 00:44:00,087
excuse me, I have to go to washroom

374
00:44:08,258 --> 00:44:09,532
Locher!

375
00:44:12,938 --> 00:44:14,053
Washroom!

376
00:44:15,738 --> 00:44:17,012
follow me

377
00:45:24,819 --> 00:45:26,935
Hurry!

378
00:45:45,139 --> 00:45:47,972
open the handcuffs, it hurts!

379
00:45:49,419 --> 00:45:51,808
What are you doing with them?

380
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:56,208
you know, Miss Scholl?
there is no leeway...

381
00:45:56,339 --> 00:45:59,251
you know it, next door to the left

382
00:46:13,219 --> 00:46:17,417
Who wrote these banner “Step out! Hitler!"...

383
00:46:18,339 --> 00:46:20,057
"FREEDOM"...

384
00:46:21,299 --> 00:46:26,657
and a crossed NSDAP badge,
University Ludwig street

385
00:46:26,779 --> 00:46:30,055
Marienplatz Kaufinger street
and Schwabing everywhere

386
00:46:30,179 --> 00:46:32,215
my brother and I

387
00:46:38,459 --> 00:46:42,611
Your brother said after he got arrested
"go back home...

388
00:46:42,739 --> 00:46:45,207
tell Alex don't wait for me"

389
00:46:47,219 --> 00:46:49,289
Schertling was right there

390
00:46:49,419 --> 00:46:52,775
He was telling Schmorell to run away?

391
00:46:53,059 --> 00:46:56,529
Hans had a appointment with Schmid,
he didn’t want him wait for nothing.

392
00:46:56,659 --> 00:47:00,254
- You mentioned about your plan to Schmorell?
- No

393
00:47:01,699 --> 00:47:04,418
- and Graf?
- No

394
00:47:16,819 --> 00:47:20,812
- why are you keep lying?
- I did not

395
00:48:01,579 --> 00:48:02,774
here

396
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:07,254
this is your confession! Sign it!

397
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:49,134
Locher!

398
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,454
take her out!

399
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:18,735
I heard about Mohr told Locher:
this kind of people...

400
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:23,052
is what Germany needs
but we have to re-educate them

401
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:27,173
Maybe they will try to
rebuild your world view

402
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:34,770
but I will tell you, they may just wait

403
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:39,053
- why?
- even the bosses are impatience

404
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:41,774
a lot people think allied forces will
get into Germany in eight to ten weeks

405
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:45,051
after that sooner or later,
Germany will be liberated

406
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:56,169
If my mother know I am under arrest

407
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,855
She won't stand the shock

408
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:05,171
She is over 60,
and she is sick all the month

409
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:11,731
If Gestapo goes to my house...

410
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:15,174
she my get in jail cause us...

411
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:18,655
and your father?

412
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:23,535
He is 10 years younger than my mom,
he always bring us the immaterial power

413
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:26,937
your mom is not alone.

414
00:51:13,141 --> 00:51:14,460
Thanks

415
00:51:17,581 --> 00:51:20,220
"we are not silence,
we are the forgotten conscience

416
00:51:20,341 --> 00:51:22,809
White roses let you cannot sleep in peace!"

417
00:51:23,941 --> 00:51:26,978
- Who are "us"?
- My brother wrote this.

418
00:51:27,101 --> 00:51:30,457
at the last line of 4th handbill,
"please copy...

419
00:51:30,581 --> 00:51:34,494
and pass around",
and here is about resist movement

420
00:51:35,661 --> 00:51:39,210
- doesn't sound like couple peoples' crime
- We don’t have organization

421
00:51:39,541 --> 00:51:41,133
How much you know about Willi Graf?

422
00:51:41,261 --> 00:51:45,379
Sergeant he has same major as my brother
came to our house sometimes.

423
00:51:45,661 --> 00:51:49,620
we knew he helped you guys
copying the handbills at the studio

424
00:51:49,901 --> 00:51:51,698
Maybe you found his fingerprint

425
00:51:51,821 --> 00:51:54,733
- but he went to studio at other time.
- When?

426
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:58,012
Middle of January,
We were going to see Eickemayer' painting

427
00:51:58,141 --> 00:52:00,371
that's the reason why
others' fingerprints are in studio

428
00:52:00,501 --> 00:52:04,540
- who were there? Schmorell?
- Maybe, I don’t know

429
00:52:04,661 --> 00:52:07,733
I was just there at beginning,
then I went to concern

430
00:52:09,061 --> 00:52:12,940
- Probst brought handbills to Salzburg and Linz?
- No

431
00:52:13,061 --> 00:52:17,213
Hans didn't tell him anything,
cause he has wife and three children

432
00:52:17,981 --> 00:52:21,974
here, you have to tell me the damn truth,
I am asking you.

433
00:52:22,101 --> 00:52:25,093
Who is in?

434
00:52:35,381 --> 00:52:37,178
Graf Anneliese?

435
00:52:37,901 --> 00:52:40,938
I totally met them about 10 times.

436
00:52:41,061 --> 00:52:45,020
- what did you talk about?
- about lecture and science

437
00:52:45,381 --> 00:52:48,817
- My impression of Graf is that he has no interested in politics
- no interested but knew the inside?

438
00:52:49,341 --> 00:52:53,220
I have to say Graf has nothing
to do with the handbills

439
00:52:53,341 --> 00:52:56,299
- how about Schertling?
- Gisela met me several times.

440
00:52:56,421 --> 00:53:00,209
we studied in same university,
and we knew each other before that.

441
00:53:00,341 --> 00:53:04,937
- she is NSDAP
- as your saying Miss Scholl

442
00:53:05,061 --> 00:53:08,940
The member of resist movement is everywhere in Germany
they all look like have no interested in politics

443
00:53:10,461 --> 00:53:12,816
It is good for your, isn’t it? Mr. Mohr

444
00:53:36,661 --> 00:53:39,255
As our counting,
this so called "white rose"...

445
00:53:39,381 --> 00:53:42,339
bought ten thousand papers in Jan...

446
00:53:42,421 --> 00:53:45,060
and two thousand envelops

447
00:53:45,181 --> 00:53:48,059
- who did that?
- my brother and I

448
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:49,938
only hundreds of handbills
for the 1st to 4th.

449
00:53:50,461 --> 00:53:53,658
it makes sense.

450
00:53:53,781 --> 00:53:56,375
But you wish I believe you two

451
00:53:56,501 --> 00:53:59,379
copied thousands of handbills
for the 5 and 6th edition?

452
00:53:59,501 --> 00:54:03,893
- then sent them out?
- we worked on them day and night.

453
00:54:04,302 --> 00:54:09,092
I admire you and you take class
at the same time?

454
00:54:10,022 --> 00:54:14,857
yes we were faking
there are lots of members

455
00:54:20,102 --> 00:54:23,333
we knew your brother Graf Schmorell

456
00:54:23,942 --> 00:54:26,502
Furtw?ngler and Wittenstein served
at eastern line before.

457
00:54:26,622 --> 00:54:29,136
all the people got in university in Munich

458
00:54:29,982 --> 00:54:33,338
any political movement between them?

459
00:54:34,382 --> 00:54:36,942
My brother just told me
about innumerable death.

460
00:54:37,062 --> 00:54:40,577
- but never talked about his comrade
- I don't believe you Miss Scholl

461
00:54:40,702 --> 00:54:44,854
At this period, everyone is careful
about their political speech.

462
00:54:45,622 --> 00:54:47,772
Just like what you say in the handbill?

463
00:54:50,582 --> 00:54:52,493
you found these address there?

464
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:55,375
copy from phonebook of German museum

465
00:55:00,542 --> 00:55:06,139
let's take a look at Stuttgart:
Jan 27th and the morning after, totally...

466
00:55:06,262 --> 00:55:09,299
sent out seven hundred handbills!

467
00:55:09,422 --> 00:55:12,175
same day at Munich...

468
00:55:12,302 --> 00:55:15,419
about two thousands handbills were sent out.

469
00:55:15,542 --> 00:55:19,251
Just you and your brother
cannot done this job!

470
00:55:19,462 --> 00:55:23,216
I took the fast train
to Stuttgart at 27th...

471
00:55:23,542 --> 00:55:26,898
handbills were in a case,
when I arrived...

472
00:55:26,982 --> 00:55:30,292
I threw half of them
into the post-box of station.

473
00:55:30,382 --> 00:55:32,737
all the left I put
into the post-box at country side

474
00:55:32,862 --> 00:55:37,060
your brother couldn’t be
at Munich in Jan 20th...

475
00:55:37,182 --> 00:55:39,855
when we found the addresses from phonebook...

476
00:55:39,982 --> 00:55:44,100
he sent out an other two thousand handbill
in different place? who was helping him?

477
00:55:44,582 --> 00:55:46,777
I wasn't at Munich

478
00:55:48,462 --> 00:55:51,135
who support you money?

479
00:55:51,262 --> 00:55:54,060
my father gave me one fifty each month.

480
00:55:54,262 --> 00:55:56,457
my brother has pay from army

481
00:55:56,582 --> 00:56:00,860
How can you afford your life and
all the handbills and postage?

482
00:56:03,382 --> 00:56:07,261
every time you trip to Ulm,
it took you 15 mark

483
00:56:07,342 --> 00:56:10,732
- we borrowed some money from friends
- from who?

484
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:22,500
here, up left corner...

485
00:56:23,182 --> 00:56:25,776
"E" must stand for income

486
00:56:25,902 --> 00:56:30,339
- it is the backer's name after amount?
- Yes

487
00:56:30,422 --> 00:56:32,538
your fiancé were in?

488
00:56:39,662 --> 00:56:41,732
- so he knew it!
- No!

489
00:56:42,542 --> 00:56:45,136
every time we borrow,
we give a pretence.

490
00:56:45,262 --> 00:56:47,457
you can ask everyone

491
00:56:50,062 --> 00:56:52,815
my brother and I are the only members

492
00:56:58,222 --> 00:57:01,498
have you thought about
if you and your brother

493
00:57:01,622 --> 00:57:03,419
assume all the crime,
what will happen to you?

494
00:57:10,503 --> 00:57:12,573
We know every name!

495
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:20,700
Miss Scholl, think about it
and cooperate with us!

496
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:23,904
we will reconsider your punishment

497
00:57:24,350 --> 00:57:27,979
think about your poor parents
and the shame you brought to them

498
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:31,864
so, right now you want me...

499
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:35,505
to sell out your so called partisan
for my own good

500
00:57:36,350 --> 00:57:39,660
exposure criminal is not sellout

501
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:42,669
my brother's classmate
has nothing to do with this

502
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:50,464
Launa

503
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:55,904
take her away

504
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:10,061
I am very worried about Fritz

505
00:58:11,270 --> 00:58:13,864
how could I write her name in my note?

506
00:58:15,630 --> 00:58:18,747
- he was sold out?
- absolutely not

507
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:22,419
- he really has not found anything?
- nothing at all

508
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:26,947
his loyalty is just like a solider
keeps his oath to Hitler

509
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:32,058
and we had fights for this many times
I am always against supporting the front line

510
00:58:32,190 --> 00:58:35,785
because this will prolong the war
and it makes him angry

511
00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:41,349
- is he in Stalingrad too?
- he used to be there

512
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:45,986
luckily, he was transferred to Lemberg
as the last group

513
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:51,949
he lived in Lazaret
Doc cut off two of his fingers

514
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:55,823
because he and his people had lain in
frozen open air all day and all night

515
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:58,589
for several weeks in 30¡ãF

516
00:58:58,710 --> 00:59:02,862
I really hope he can survive from the war,
while not become its victim

517
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:06,948
what will happen
if Fritz knows you were here?

518
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:09,746
he shall understand me

519
00:59:20,950 --> 00:59:22,349
hope so

520
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:25,820
what does he look like?

521
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:30,064
tall, brown hair

522
00:59:31,870 --> 00:59:33,588
a free elf

523
00:59:34,550 --> 00:59:37,144
and he can always make me laugh

524
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:43,420
love, this unconditional love,
is so amazing

525
00:59:44,870 --> 00:59:47,145
when was the last time you saw him?

526
00:59:49,990 --> 00:59:55,383
last summer,
we were in Karolinensiel of Nordsee

527
00:59:55,830 --> 00:59:59,539
early morning, we sailed out

528
01:00:01,150 --> 01:00:03,823
and went to the beach
by bike together in the evening

529
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:09,304
singing, chat and talk about peace at night

530
01:00:10,431 --> 01:00:15,221
no solider, no plane and no bomb

531
01:00:17,351 --> 01:00:20,388
only the sea and sky

532
01:00:22,831 --> 01:00:24,901
sea breeze and our dreams

533
01:01:22,111 --> 01:01:25,786
dear God, what can I do besides confiding you

534
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:29,701
there is nothing I can do
but to leave you my own heart

535
01:01:30,511 --> 01:01:34,470
you create us,
and our hearts are so tense

536
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:36,707
only to be with you,
I shall find peace inside

537
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:39,464
Amon

538
01:01:58,831 --> 01:02:00,628
here you are, drink it

539
01:02:16,031 --> 01:02:17,987
it's the coffee
made by authentic coffee bean

540
01:02:19,271 --> 01:02:23,264
for you, Miss Scholl, this also means
the happiness of Deutschland, right?

541
01:02:24,631 --> 01:02:27,941
- yes
- and you are not like Elser

542
01:02:28,031 --> 01:02:30,499
put bomb in B¨¹rgerbrukeller in Munich 1939

543
01:02:30,631 --> 01:02:35,751
although you chose the wrong slogan
you made a peaceful way

544
01:02:38,831 --> 01:02:41,140
so why do you guys want to punish me anyway?

545
01:02:41,231 --> 01:02:45,144
because of the law!
no law, no order!

546
01:02:45,271 --> 01:02:49,059
the law you referring used
to defend people's liberty of speech

547
01:02:49,191 --> 01:02:52,467
before Hitler took power in 1933
but now, under his government

548
01:02:52,591 --> 01:02:57,540
people who deliver free speech are treated by heavy penalty
or death and does order have anything to do with this?

549
01:02:58,031 --> 01:03:00,625
if we don't abide by the law
what else should we abide?

550
01:03:00,751 --> 01:03:03,982
- abide by the law, no matter whose law it is
- that depends on your conscience

551
01:03:05,351 --> 01:03:06,751
what?

552
01:03:09,032 --> 01:03:11,785
this is the law
this is the people

553
01:03:11,952 --> 01:03:15,024
I, as a police officer am amenable to check
whether people's behavior matches the law

554
01:03:15,152 --> 01:03:16,824
and if it doesn't

555
01:03:18,072 --> 01:03:21,189
- I have to figure out where the problem is
- law can be changed

556
01:03:21,312 --> 01:03:24,304
- conscience won't
- what if everyone...

557
01:03:24,432 --> 01:03:27,583
judge right and wrong by his conscience
what result would it become?

558
01:03:27,712 --> 01:03:30,624
and what if the criminals succeed in dropping
the reins of government what will it be?

559
01:03:30,752 --> 01:03:34,108
unavoidably, there will be serious chaos
and those so called freethinking

560
01:03:34,232 --> 01:03:37,144
federation, democracy, we used to have

561
01:03:37,232 --> 01:03:39,063
we know where that will lead us to

562
01:03:39,192 --> 01:03:42,821
everyone will regain his right and order
if there is no Hitler, his party and...

563
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:46,827
protect to autocratic personal rejection
not just protect people going with the stream

564
01:03:47,552 --> 01:03:49,270
autocratic, main stream

565
01:03:49,392 --> 01:03:52,304
- you are just disdainful
- no, you are

566
01:03:52,432 --> 01:03:55,583
you consider my brother and me as criminals
just because of those sheets

567
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:58,983
although we've done nothing then
only words tried to convince you

568
01:03:59,272 --> 01:04:03,788
you have privilege,
you and your relatives use this privilege shamefully

569
01:04:03,912 --> 01:04:06,472
you can use our money
for college during wartime

570
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:09,664
with damn democracy,
all I've learned is slaughter

571
01:04:09,792 --> 01:04:12,590
do you know who made me become a policeman?
French who occupied Pfalz

572
01:04:12,712 --> 01:04:16,148
not German democracy,
if there wasn't this campaign

573
01:04:16,272 --> 01:04:18,706
I was still a policeman
in the countryside of Pirmasens today

574
01:04:20,752 --> 01:04:25,143
shameful Versailles Treaty,
inflation, unemployment

575
01:04:25,232 --> 01:04:28,907
Economic crisis, our leader Adolf Hitler
swept off all of this

576
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:31,227
and also lead Germany to a doomed war

577
01:04:31,352 --> 01:04:34,628
- it's free of charge for all of the Victims
- in this heroically war

578
01:04:34,952 --> 01:04:37,591
you and us that you disdain and fight against

579
01:04:37,712 --> 01:04:39,430
both feed ourselves

580
01:04:39,552 --> 01:04:42,146
no matter what happens
you live a better life than we do

581
01:04:42,752 --> 01:04:47,428
you absolutely have no need to do so
actually you still said that

582
01:04:47,552 --> 01:04:49,907
our leader and Deutschland are protecting you

583
01:04:50,032 --> 01:04:53,707
among this, in Wittelsbacher Palais
or my family with background

584
01:04:53,832 --> 01:04:56,710
our German soldiers are liberating Europe from
money-supremacy and

585
01:04:56,832 --> 01:05:00,541
Bolschewisten,
and for a wider and free Germany

586
01:05:00,672 --> 01:05:03,744
Germany's territory will not be occupied
you have my words

587
01:05:03,872 --> 01:05:06,466
at the end of the war
foreign troops will garrison

588
01:05:06,592 --> 01:05:10,301
people will point at us
saying we didn't fight against Hitler

589
01:05:10,792 --> 01:05:13,431
if we win out at last

590
01:05:13,512 --> 01:05:16,310
after bleeding and sacrifice German people
will live a richer and free life as your dream

591
01:05:16,432 --> 01:05:20,220
and at that moment, as a member of BDM
what will you say?

592
01:05:21,952 --> 01:05:25,103
German people don't have that belief any more
while under Hitler's rule

593
01:05:26,032 --> 01:05:28,671
If it really come true,
should I say this?

594
01:05:31,632 --> 01:05:34,192
- Are you a prophet?
- Yes

595
01:05:35,192 --> 01:05:37,626
Even the Church is asking
the disciples to follow their lead.

596
01:05:37,752 --> 01:05:40,869
- Even in  despair
- In Church, everyone is free

597
01:05:41,512 --> 01:05:44,709
But Hitler and Nazis
will not give them other choices

598
01:05:46,032 --> 01:05:50,583
Why a young person like you will take
this kind of risks for these wrong ideas

599
01:05:56,952 --> 01:05:59,068
For my own conscience

600
01:06:01,952 --> 01:06:03,704
I don't understand, with your talent

601
01:06:03,832 --> 01:06:06,630
you can't understand and feel right
about National Socialist German

602
01:06:07,352 --> 01:06:09,583
Freedom, Honor, Wealth

603
01:06:09,713 --> 01:06:13,262
A morally responsible country,
this is our faith

604
01:06:13,513 --> 01:06:16,550
Nazi in the name of freedom and honor

605
01:06:16,633 --> 01:06:19,227
Bloodshed the entire Europe

606
01:06:19,353 --> 01:06:21,025
Even this can not wake you up?

607
01:06:23,873 --> 01:06:26,341
If the German youth can not finally relieves Hitler from
his power and help together make a new, better Europe

608
01:06:26,473 --> 01:06:30,148
then Germany will always be a shameful name

609
01:06:30,513 --> 01:06:33,710
New Europe only can
be the national socialism nature

610
01:06:33,833 --> 01:06:36,188
If your leader is a lunatic

611
01:06:36,753 --> 01:06:39,984
Think about national hatred! at Ulm

612
01:06:40,113 --> 01:06:44,186
A Jew teacher was brought before SA-Gruppe

613
01:06:45,153 --> 01:06:48,623
Everyone was ordered to walk
in front of him and spit on his face

614
01:06:50,033 --> 01:06:54,823
At that night, he is gone.
Disappeared like thousands disappeared in 1941

615
01:06:54,913 --> 01:06:57,188
forced to the eastern frontline

616
01:06:57,473 --> 01:07:01,546
You believe these bullshits?
The Jews moved away themselves

617
01:07:01,673 --> 01:07:04,790
Soldiers from eastern frontline were already
talking about slaughters in the concentration camp

618
01:07:04,913 --> 01:07:07,632
Hitler wants to kill all Jews in Europe

619
01:07:07,753 --> 01:07:11,143
He was promoting this absurd idea 20 years ago
How could you believe?

620
01:07:11,273 --> 01:07:13,946
Jew are different from us

621
01:07:14,033 --> 01:07:17,025
This guy will only bring us bad luck
But you

622
01:07:17,153 --> 01:07:20,623
are only a young girl has been misled
by wrong teaching

623
01:07:20,753 --> 01:07:25,031
Probably it's our own fault I feel someone like
you should be a member of our Bund deutsche Maedel

624
01:07:25,313 --> 01:07:27,269
You known, when I learned

625
01:07:27,393 --> 01:07:32,626
Nazis are killing mentally impaired children
with poison gas, how shocked was I?

626
01:07:33,113 --> 01:07:37,072
My mom's friends has described to me
how the children from Church Welfare program were taken from the caretakers

627
01:07:37,193 --> 01:07:40,583
Taken away by trucks

628
01:07:41,753 --> 01:07:45,029
The kids were asking
"Where does the truck go?"

629
01:07:45,753 --> 01:07:49,268
"Going to heaven" Caretakers answers

630
01:07:49,673 --> 01:07:53,063
So the kids got on the truck and singing.

631
01:07:53,273 --> 01:07:56,822
I have the same feelings like them.
You think I am not taught well?

632
01:07:59,473 --> 01:08:04,786
These are invaluable lives
You have heard from the caretakers

633
01:08:04,993 --> 01:08:07,985
They have mental patients.

634
01:08:08,633 --> 01:08:12,308
Yes, I clearly know
under any circumstances,

635
01:08:12,433 --> 01:08:15,982
nobody will be treated
like a person created by God.

636
01:08:16,393 --> 01:08:19,783
Nobody knows, what the soul
of a mental patient is like?

637
01:08:20,273 --> 01:08:23,424
nobody knows, that innate,
incredibly mature existence without body

638
01:08:23,553 --> 01:08:25,623
every life has it's value

639
01:08:28,513 --> 01:08:32,267
You must get used to this coming new age

640
01:08:33,513 --> 01:08:36,789
What you have said is not reality

641
01:08:37,393 --> 01:08:42,513
What I said is related to reality and custom

642
01:08:42,713 --> 01:08:46,422
- Relate to Moral God
- God doesn't exist

643
01:09:08,553 --> 01:09:14,424
You believe what your brother did is right?

644
01:09:14,554 --> 01:09:19,833
You are just an accomplice
It's not like that?

645
01:09:20,314 --> 01:09:22,828
Should we write down like this

646
01:09:24,234 --> 01:09:26,270
No, Mr. Mohr
Because it is not the truth

647
01:09:37,154 --> 01:09:40,908
You known, I have a son.
He is one year younger than you

648
01:09:41,634 --> 01:09:45,752
He sometimes has some weird crazy ideas
But now he is in eastern frontline

649
01:09:45,874 --> 01:09:48,786
Because he knows he must perform his duty.

650
01:09:49,034 --> 01:09:51,867
Mr. Mohr, do you believe out final victory?

651
01:09:53,634 --> 01:09:56,467
Ms. Scholl, if you think about everything

652
01:09:56,994 --> 01:10:00,225
you wouldn't involved in these activities

653
01:10:00,794 --> 01:10:02,671
This is about your life

654
01:10:12,914 --> 01:10:18,272
Here. This is what I wrote

655
01:10:19,834 --> 01:10:22,906
According to our questioning
Below conclusions were drawn

656
01:10:23,034 --> 01:10:26,743
Your brother's and your Behavior

657
01:10:26,834 --> 01:10:30,144
In wartime,
it is a crime again the Nazi Party

658
01:10:30,234 --> 01:10:33,306
Especially in the eyes of
tough fighting army from the eastern frontline

659
01:10:33,394 --> 01:10:38,104
You must face severest punishment.

660
01:10:39,434 --> 01:10:41,709
but in my eyes

661
01:10:42,114 --> 01:10:45,902
confession is not equal to betrayal

662
01:10:46,194 --> 01:10:50,073
Maybe like this,
I rather say. Not mine

663
01:10:50,154 --> 01:10:52,748
but your world view is flawed

664
01:10:52,834 --> 01:10:56,747
Like before, same viewpoint
I have done what is right for my people

665
01:10:57,154 --> 01:11:01,033
I have no regrets I will solely take
all responsibility for all consequences

666
01:11:12,114 --> 01:11:15,311
notekeeper, keep the record.
yes.

667
01:11:16,554 --> 01:11:18,988
like boss know, we are done shortly

668
01:11:49,074 --> 01:11:52,908
If we swear to give up our ideal
Mohr will make a bridge for us with gold

669
01:11:53,474 --> 01:11:56,910
- Really?
- I wouldn't take that risk

670
01:11:57,714 --> 01:11:59,306
Why not?

671
01:12:00,554 --> 01:12:05,105
Sophie, you are so young
you have to live for your ideal and yourself

672
01:12:05,234 --> 01:12:09,386
for your family
For god's sake, take his help

673
01:12:09,755 --> 01:12:11,427
There is no way back

674
01:12:30,155 --> 01:12:31,907
Air Raid Alert

675
01:12:53,675 --> 01:12:57,748
Get down, don't stand beside the windows
get down on the ground is the safest

676
01:13:06,635 --> 01:13:08,068
Get down

677
01:13:11,075 --> 01:13:13,669
Won't take long
we are free

678
01:13:42,955 --> 01:13:45,150
The one just took is not Schmorell

679
01:13:46,955 --> 01:13:49,230
It is Christoph Probst

680
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:51,745
Same, Treason

681
01:13:58,075 --> 01:14:00,748
I am really sorry
I thought

682
01:14:04,555 --> 01:14:06,432
He has 3 kids

683
01:14:11,235 --> 01:14:13,874
the youngest was just born.

684
01:14:15,355 --> 01:14:18,188
His wife got puerperal fever

685
01:14:33,235 --> 01:14:35,544
Ms. Scholl, you must go see litigant now

686
01:14:51,835 --> 01:14:53,268
Hurry

687
01:15:04,595 --> 01:15:06,586
This is my litigation

688
01:15:08,755 --> 01:15:11,509
your case will be judged at Munich Civil Court
by a senior judge

689
01:15:11,596 --> 01:15:14,547
I have submitted court order

690
01:15:14,836 --> 01:15:17,748
- is it going to be tomorrow?
- no one wants to see it delayed

691
01:15:27,236 --> 01:15:31,024
treason, cause damage to nuclear power station

692
01:15:35,716 --> 01:15:38,025
it will be a public hearing

693
01:15:47,556 --> 01:15:50,024
what a glorious day

694
01:15:59,756 --> 01:16:02,429
I sincerely pray to you

695
01:16:03,836 --> 01:16:06,873
to call upon you

696
01:16:06,996 --> 01:16:12,866
even if you might not know anything about this
I am still hoping to get some comfort from you

697
01:16:14,756 --> 01:16:16,155
I pray to you

698
01:16:17,036 --> 01:16:22,315
My Lord, please don't abundant me
My dear father, please do not abundant me

699
01:16:25,556 --> 01:16:26,989
Amen

700
01:16:33,556 --> 01:16:35,990
My name is Klein, I am your lawyer
appointed by the court

701
01:16:36,316 --> 01:16:38,386
have you seen the court order?

702
01:16:40,676 --> 01:16:42,792
- I have read it
- any questions?

703
01:16:44,076 --> 01:16:46,795
what would happen to my parents
who live in Ulm

704
01:16:51,156 --> 01:16:52,430
Please

705
01:16:54,436 --> 01:16:56,745
it will be considered in a separate case

706
01:16:57,236 --> 01:17:01,514
I just want to know what would happen to them
aren't you my lawyer?

707
01:17:01,956 --> 01:17:05,232
the way you said it as if I was responsible
for the state that you are in

708
01:17:05,356 --> 01:17:08,473
I am entitled to know what would happen
to my family and you know that

709
01:17:08,556 --> 01:17:11,309
do you think you have right to make a request?

710
01:17:13,076 --> 01:17:16,910
whatever comes to my older brother
I don't want a mild sentence

711
01:17:17,036 --> 01:17:19,550
from your angle, I am just guilty
as he is

712
01:17:19,676 --> 01:17:22,065
is there anything more that you
wish to add?

713
01:17:23,036 --> 01:17:25,994
- no
- regarding your brother and you, you are saying

714
01:17:26,116 --> 01:17:30,109
you don't actually want to be a German Citizen
are you sure about that?

715
01:17:30,236 --> 01:17:33,831
the chairman of the people's court will
arrive here from Berlin tomorrow

716
01:17:33,956 --> 01:17:36,345
he will make you forget about this non-sense
you just said, young lady

717
01:17:36,476 --> 01:17:39,070
he will make you and your older brother
feel sorry for what you did

718
01:17:39,756 --> 01:17:41,826
open the door

719
01:17:43,956 --> 01:17:48,586
- any questions?
- no no, see you in court tomorrow

720
01:17:53,396 --> 01:17:54,875
what a coward

721
01:18:00,436 --> 01:18:03,508
Freisler will be suing both of you tomorrow

722
01:18:04,196 --> 01:18:08,155
he used to an USSR police officer
he has to prove his loyalty

723
01:18:09,356 --> 01:18:12,906
our father used to say: I hope you
can live forever in honesty and freedom

724
01:18:13,117 --> 01:18:14,914
however difficult the circumstance it may be

725
01:18:26,397 --> 01:18:28,467
will there be people from the public?

726
01:18:29,397 --> 01:18:33,436
Mmm, there will be
It is a show, to warn others

727
01:18:33,557 --> 01:18:35,991
then Freisler will surely mention leaflets
in front the whole crowd

728
01:18:36,117 --> 01:18:41,032
everyone is going to listen to our view
the students definitely will

729
01:18:41,157 --> 01:18:44,627
maybe a riot, if they know this
was only because of a few leaflets

730
01:18:48,037 --> 01:18:53,430
the result will be an embarrassment for them
the worst scenario would be that

731
01:18:53,557 --> 01:18:57,106
everyone gets shot in 99 days

732
01:19:00,997 --> 01:19:05,513
my older brother once said that
we need to be tough and yet compassionate

733
01:19:14,957 --> 01:19:16,629
I once dreamed that

734
01:19:16,997 --> 01:19:19,989
I was holding a child in my chest
who wore a long white skirt

735
01:19:20,117 --> 01:19:23,905
I could feel her warmth...
suddenly, the earth shook

736
01:19:24,037 --> 01:19:26,835
the ice beneath our feet cracked

737
01:19:27,837 --> 01:19:31,591
I began to slip, then I saw the child

738
01:19:31,717 --> 01:19:35,153
luckily I had enough time to move her
to a safer ground

739
01:19:36,237 --> 01:19:40,230
I felt, but I felt liberated and relaxed

740
01:19:41,877 --> 01:19:45,711
the long white skirted child is our ideal
it survived

741
01:19:50,917 --> 01:19:54,956
- Scholl, stop it
- she should have worn appropriate cloth

742
01:20:02,757 --> 01:20:03,985
thank you

743
01:20:28,917 --> 01:20:32,114
- let God be with you, Sophie
- let God be with you, Elser

744
01:20:33,757 --> 01:20:35,031
thank you so much

745
01:22:47,038 --> 01:22:49,552
- how are you?
- and yourself?

746
01:22:49,638 --> 01:22:52,198
be quiet, you only answer
when are you are asked

747
01:22:53,318 --> 01:22:55,707
- you must fight for yourself
- be quiet please

748
01:23:11,958 --> 01:23:14,472
- heil Hitler
- heil Hitler

749
01:23:32,118 --> 01:23:35,155
I hereof announce, the No. 1 court of people
opens the case for

750
01:23:35,278 --> 01:23:39,954
Hans Fritz Scholl, Sophie Magdalena Scholl
from Munich

751
01:23:40,078 --> 01:23:44,469
and Christoph Hermann Probst from Aldrans

752
01:23:44,598 --> 01:23:47,635
to cause damage to nuclear power station
and to protect enemies

753
01:23:47,958 --> 01:23:50,233
Probst Christoph

754
01:24:10,238 --> 01:24:13,435
you are married with 3 children?

755
01:24:13,839 --> 01:24:17,195
yes, 2 and a half, 1 and 3 months
and 4 weeks old

756
01:24:17,319 --> 01:24:21,710
regardless your irresponsible behavior
how are you suppose

757
01:24:21,839 --> 01:24:25,627
- to bring your children up to be real Germans
- I am a good father and

758
01:24:25,799 --> 01:24:28,393
and what?

759
01:24:30,359 --> 01:24:32,031
have no Political ambition

760
01:24:32,159 --> 01:24:35,629
he is saying he does not have any Political
ambitions, that almost made me laugh

761
01:24:37,439 --> 01:24:39,270
is this your handwriting

762
01:24:40,679 --> 01:24:44,308
- yes
- it was not because of benefit

763
01:24:44,439 --> 01:24:46,555
from a socialist government

764
01:24:46,679 --> 01:24:51,594
it was a nation's social politics

765
01:24:51,719 --> 01:24:54,711
gave you the chance to have your family

766
01:24:54,839 --> 01:24:58,832
and stopped Scholl's request to write

767
01:24:58,959 --> 01:25:01,871
an article based on
this Stalingrad female hero's story

768
01:25:01,999 --> 01:25:05,275
to portrait our leaders as military exploiters

769
01:25:05,399 --> 01:25:08,357
so that she will surrender

770
01:25:08,479 --> 01:25:10,834
yes, it was just a thought

771
01:25:10,959 --> 01:25:15,350
the word "just" does not exist
when German people have to fight to survive

772
01:25:15,479 --> 01:25:19,392
but I had to admit, I was really
depressed at the time when I wrote this

773
01:25:19,479 --> 01:25:23,108
really? you were depressed at the time?

774
01:25:23,199 --> 01:25:25,713
was that the reason?

775
01:25:25,839 --> 01:25:29,275
the thought went into my head when
I was really depressed

776
01:25:29,399 --> 01:25:31,993
the war, my wife's fever after giving birth
all of these...

777
01:25:32,079 --> 01:25:36,311
Aha, listen everyone
this will not help you to escape from your crime

778
01:25:36,439 --> 01:25:38,873
I had denied it in writing yesterday

779
01:25:39,479 --> 01:25:42,471
plus, I need to clarify that
I did not use finance

780
01:25:42,599 --> 01:25:45,557
or any other way to spread rumors

781
01:25:45,639 --> 01:25:48,153
manipulate anyone

782
01:25:48,239 --> 01:25:51,037
- what my true intention was
- yes, we have heard

783
01:25:51,159 --> 01:25:55,118
you said you were a manipulated idiot
so you can be spared

784
01:25:59,079 --> 01:26:02,389
Mr. Chairman, my children need their father

785
01:26:02,519 --> 01:26:05,909
German children do not need a father like you

786
01:26:06,039 --> 01:26:10,032
you are not worthy, Probst

787
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:17,995
- defendant, do you have any other questions?
- no, Mr. chairman

788
01:26:19,199 --> 01:26:20,314
bring him down

789
01:26:37,319 --> 01:26:39,833
Scholl, Hans

790
01:26:56,279 --> 01:27:01,307
- You have read medicine since 1939?
- yes

791
01:27:01,439 --> 01:27:05,068
and still thankful for this socialist government
giving you the chance to have

792
01:27:05,199 --> 01:27:08,555
- benefit of 8 terms of study
- it is 8 terms

793
01:27:08,679 --> 01:27:13,548
you spent this nation's money
like a parasite

794
01:27:14,239 --> 01:27:17,277
during the time, you were serving at
a mobile war medical unit

795
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:21,916
and worked as a medical staff on the
front line between July and November 1942?

796
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:23,917
it was also true but
I want to say is that

797
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:28,033
- please be quiet before I ask you
- I want to say that I am not a parasite

798
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:30,913
shut your mouth or I will have you removed
from this court

799
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:34,350
to serve as a soldier was a duty
from the medicine school

800
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:37,790
oh, we will talk about duty

801
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:42,436
as an university student, you have the
duty to lead an example life

802
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:46,109
and you were provided with
benefit from the Kingdom

803
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:50,916
but this did not stop you at the
beginning of summer 1942

804
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:55,028
giving out 4 "white rose" leaflets

805
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:59,233
to spread the negative rumor that German
will one day be defeated in the war

806
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:03,273
and used any possible chances

807
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:07,393
to change German people's way of life
in a socialist society

808
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:10,637
- and to destroy their government
- it is outrages

809
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:12,751
- all lies
- traitors

810
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:14,956
Scholl

811
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:20,309
you also have harbored your sister

812
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:26,790
- it was my decision
- did I ask you, defendant?

813
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:30,913
- I need to speak out the truth
- your view will not influence our judgment

814
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:36,511
did you write this leaflet?

815
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:41,509
did you believe that German people will only
survive through selling out their own country?

816
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:50,479
- the way will not
- answer yes or no, it is not a difficult question

817
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:53,956
we do not have a chance to fight against
the US, the UK and the USSR at the same time

818
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:55,798
look at the map for yourself

819
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:59,071
Hitler is leading Germans to a sheer hell

820
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:01,634
he can't win this war, he is only
extending the time of suffering

821
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:05,548
did you think German's fighting spirit

822
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:08,638
was no match for theirs

823
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:11,320
you promote the enemy

824
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:14,238
will lead more German casualties

825
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:17,591
the only way to stop more casualties
is to win it quickly

826
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:19,790
- win the war? how?
- to stop more casualties

827
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:23,833
you think you alone can decide
the outcome of the war?

828
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:28,238
what German wants is just a war

829
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:32,751
German's blood had bled dry, they want
peach, Hitler and his supporters

830
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:35,638
will be responsible for the genocide

831
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:39,355
this far excided just a war
every one knows that

832
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:41,749
- everyone?
- who are you talking about?

833
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:44,872
you are a mad dog

834
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:48,077
how dear you trying to bite in a high court

835
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:52,753
many of audience here as well as myself
went to the war in the east

836
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:55,519
but you did not

837
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:59,913
I have seen with my own eyes the bloodshed
in Poland and USSR

838
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:02,793
staring at the women and children

839
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:07,555
- killed by German soldiers
- and you naively thank that

840
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:13,112
people here will believe your non-sense

841
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:15,515
if Hitler and yourself are not afraid
of our thoughts

842
01:30:15,641 --> 01:30:18,360
- then we will stand here today
- shut your mouth

843
01:30:18,481 --> 01:30:22,474
what a shameless liar

844
01:30:22,601 --> 01:30:27,675
you are an idiot, a traitor

845
01:30:28,161 --> 01:30:29,879
case closed

846
01:30:31,841 --> 01:30:34,480
- any more questions?
- no

847
01:30:36,121 --> 01:30:39,955
- I have no further question, Mr. chairman
- Scholl Hans, get back to your seat

848
01:30:54,161 --> 01:30:55,799
Sophie Scholl

849
01:31:09,041 --> 01:31:12,078
you have giving out leaflets in university

850
01:31:12,201 --> 01:31:16,274
- aren't you ashamed of what you have done
- no, I don't feel so

851
01:31:16,401 --> 01:31:18,995
giving out leaflets in university
is that all?

852
01:31:19,881 --> 01:31:22,839
no, I wanted to have

853
01:31:22,961 --> 01:31:25,521
speak louder, we can not hear you

854
01:31:26,721 --> 01:31:28,871
I wanted to give out the last lot
of leaflets

855
01:31:29,001 --> 01:31:34,473
- so, our ideal can be quickly...
- ideal? you call this filthy your ideal

856
01:31:34,601 --> 01:31:38,310
so dumb, you are not worthy being
a German University student

857
01:31:39,001 --> 01:31:42,630
- we fight with our words
- so you wrote

858
01:31:44,121 --> 01:31:49,639
¡°Nazi will ruin your lives¡±

859
01:31:49,761 --> 01:31:53,674
have a look at yourself
and look at the low class people

860
01:31:54,041 --> 01:31:57,238
where did you get the paper
to make the leaflets?

861
01:31:57,361 --> 01:32:01,912
- bought from university
- oh, from university

862
01:32:02,041 --> 01:32:07,240
you have stolen them while there is
a shortage of paper

863
01:32:07,361 --> 01:32:10,319
this is treason

864
01:32:10,441 --> 01:32:12,830
my brother and I tried to use these leaflets

865
01:32:12,961 --> 01:32:17,318
to awaken German people to stop the blood shed
against the Jews

866
01:32:17,441 --> 01:32:21,070
and not to wait for the other 3 countries
to finish us off

867
01:32:21,481 --> 01:32:24,393
do we want to be expelled from the world
hated by all the nations?

868
01:32:24,521 --> 01:32:26,796
a dominating nation will not care about this

869
01:32:26,921 --> 01:32:30,152
your dominating nation wants peace

870
01:32:31,401 --> 01:32:34,040
to find pride in peach

871
01:32:34,961 --> 01:32:39,159
it wants God, Conscience and compassion

872
01:32:39,241 --> 01:32:41,801
and what is your point?

873
01:32:41,881 --> 01:32:45,078
war will bring German victory

874
01:32:45,201 --> 01:32:51,117
it will become stronger, more pure
after the war

875
01:32:51,361 --> 01:32:54,114
what we said and wrote was also
believed by many

876
01:32:54,961 --> 01:32:58,840
- they just do not dare to say it
- you can shut your mouth then

877
01:32:59,441 --> 01:33:02,114
- do you have more questions to ask me?
- no

878
01:33:05,761 --> 01:33:08,400
session finished, take her away

879
01:33:19,482 --> 01:33:23,395
we will now sum up the
defendant. Statements

880
01:33:24,322 --> 01:33:30,033
- I am
- Please ask them to leave the court

881
01:33:30,122 --> 01:33:32,761
I am Robert Scholl, the father of
two of the defendants

882
01:33:32,962 --> 01:33:36,159
- I want to clarify a few points
- I did not permit you to do so

883
01:33:36,242 --> 01:33:40,633
- get out, take him out
- this is about justice

884
01:33:43,882 --> 01:33:44,951
Silence!

885
01:33:48,402 --> 01:33:52,839
Now for your last statement
defendants, rise please!

886
01:33:55,602 --> 01:33:59,436
- Probst?
- I beg you to spare me, for the sake of my children

887
01:33:59,962 --> 01:34:02,430
I admit and repent everything I have done

888
01:34:05,202 --> 01:34:06,874
And you, Scholl?

889
01:34:11,722 --> 01:34:15,397
I beg you, your honor. Spare this man,
and punish me instead.

890
01:34:15,482 --> 01:34:20,158
If you have nothing to say in your own
behalf, be silent!

891
01:34:23,162 --> 01:34:25,039
Sophia Scholl?

892
01:34:26,282 --> 01:34:29,160
Soon, you shall stand where
we are standing right now.

893
01:34:30,122 --> 01:34:34,320
Every decent human being in this room is
indignant because of what you have said

894
01:34:49,922 --> 01:34:52,117
In name of the German people

895
01:34:52,762 --> 01:34:56,641
The following charges against
Hans Fritz Scholl from Munich

896
01:34:56,762 --> 01:34:59,959
Sophia Magdalena Scholl
from Munich...

897
01:35:00,162 --> 01:35:02,835
And Christoph Hermann Probst
from Aldrans...

898
01:35:02,962 --> 01:35:06,796
are recognized by the 1. senate of the
supreme court...

899
01:35:06,882 --> 01:35:10,955
on February 221943:

900
01:35:11,042 --> 01:35:15,911
The defendants have been sending out flyers
during the war, in order to sabotage

901
01:35:16,002 --> 01:35:20,757
the Arms production and to overthrow the
National Social way of life of our people

902
01:35:20,842 --> 01:35:25,358
To propagandize dangerous ideas and
to disgrace our leader

903
01:35:25,442 --> 01:35:28,161
By doing so helped the enemies
of this country,

904
01:35:28,242 --> 01:35:30,631
and demoralized our troops.

905
01:35:30,722 --> 01:35:33,520
Therefore you are sentenced to death.

906
01:35:33,602 --> 01:35:36,241
You are deprived of any rights as citizen
of this country

907
01:35:36,322 --> 01:35:38,995
You will cover the expense of this trial

908
01:35:39,082 --> 01:35:40,993
Your terror will be over soon

909
01:35:42,242 --> 01:35:45,518
Today you hang us, and tomorrow it
will be your turn

910
01:35:45,602 --> 01:35:47,081
Take them away!

911
01:35:52,042 --> 01:35:54,158
- Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler!

912
01:37:42,843 --> 01:37:44,037
This way!

913
01:38:03,923 --> 01:38:06,073
If you have anything to say before
your execution...

914
01:38:06,163 --> 01:38:08,882
Please make it short,
Ms. Scholl.

915
01:38:10,883 --> 01:38:12,680
It is today?

916
01:38:14,243 --> 01:38:16,837
I was told, everybody has 99 days...

917
01:38:17,203 --> 01:38:18,921
You should start writing.

918
01:40:30,964 --> 01:40:33,353
Come, somebody is here to see you

919
01:40:34,884 --> 01:40:36,158
See me?

920
01:41:13,964 --> 01:41:16,080
Please don't be afraid

921
01:41:17,444 --> 01:41:19,799
Given the choice, I would still
do the same thing

922
01:41:20,204 --> 01:41:24,834
You did everything well,
I am proud of you

923
01:41:34,244 --> 01:41:35,836
My little girl

924
01:41:38,324 --> 01:41:39,643
Mama...

925
01:41:42,364 --> 01:41:45,276
How you stand here right before me,
brave and steadfast.

926
01:41:48,404 --> 01:41:51,714
Now, you will never again come
in through our door.

927
01:41:52,844 --> 01:41:55,312
We shall meet again in the eternity

928
01:41:57,044 --> 01:42:00,639
Go, Sophie.
Jesus...

929
01:42:00,924 --> 01:42:04,633
Yes, Mother, you too...

930
01:42:05,644 --> 01:42:08,033
Ms. Scholl, please

931
01:42:52,445 --> 01:42:55,164
I have just said farewell to my parents

932
01:42:56,765 --> 01:42:58,323
They will understand

933
01:43:01,205 --> 01:43:02,638
Come with me, please

934
01:43:24,525 --> 01:43:27,961
Ms. Scholl, my name is Alt.

935
01:43:28,245 --> 01:43:30,634
I am the priest in this prison

936
01:43:31,245 --> 01:43:33,839
God, oh almighty father

937
01:43:34,965 --> 01:43:38,037
make this earth fruitful

938
01:43:38,125 --> 01:43:40,639
So the seeds you sow do not fall in vain

939
01:43:41,725 --> 01:43:45,240
Let hope grow, oh my creator,

940
01:43:45,605 --> 01:43:48,517
for those who will only see it for
the last time

941
01:43:50,005 --> 01:43:52,599
- Amen.
- Amen.

942
01:43:57,125 --> 01:43:59,400
I beg you to give me the blessing of God

943
01:44:07,765 --> 01:44:13,237
God the father gives you his blessing,
for you are created by his own image

944
01:44:13,725 --> 01:44:16,114
God the son gives you his blessing,

945
01:44:16,325 --> 01:44:19,715
for his suffering and death have saved you

946
01:44:20,445 --> 01:44:23,084
God the holy spirit gives you his blessing

947
01:44:23,445 --> 01:44:27,563
for he has taken you to his sacred temple

948
01:44:29,365 --> 01:44:33,278
Oh, all mighty God
Have mercy in your judgment

949
01:44:34,365 --> 01:44:37,118
and grant you,
the eternal life

950
01:44:38,325 --> 01:44:39,758
- Amen
- Amen

951
01:44:51,845 --> 01:44:55,360
No one's love is greater than those who sacrifice
their own life for their friends

952
01:44:56,005 --> 01:44:57,643
God is with you

953
01:45:12,965 --> 01:45:15,479
This is against the regulation, but...

954
01:45:37,606 --> 01:45:39,597
Please hurry

955
01:45:42,366 --> 01:45:43,924
Thanks

956
01:46:27,486 --> 01:46:29,044
It is not in vain.

957
01:47:07,766 --> 01:47:09,324
Ms. Scholl.

958
01:47:29,966 --> 01:47:31,524
The sun is still bright in the sky

959
01:47:57,286 --> 01:47:59,197
Sophia Magdalena Scholl

960
01:47:59,446 --> 01:48:04,918
The national attorney general has decided
on 22.2.1943,

961
01:48:05,286 --> 01:48:07,516
that no pardon will be granted.

962
01:48:07,606 --> 01:48:10,359
So the justice shall run like a river

963
01:48:12,126 --> 01:48:16,517
It is 17:00
The death sentence is to be carried out

964
01:48:50,447 --> 01:48:52,677
Long live the Freedom!

965
01:49:37,047 --> 01:49:40,084
The 6th flyer from the "White Rose"
was brought by Helmuth von Moltke

966
01:49:40,167 --> 01:49:43,796
through Scandinavia to England
Millions of copies were...

967
01:49:43,887 --> 01:49:48,358
air dropped by the allied planes
over Germany in 1943

968
01:49:48,647 --> 01:49:52,003
The title is:
A German flyer,

969
01:49:52,087 --> 01:49:54,555
Manifest of Munich students
