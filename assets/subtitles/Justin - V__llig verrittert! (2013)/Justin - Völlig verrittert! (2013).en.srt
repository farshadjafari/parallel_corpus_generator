1
00:01:15,206 --> 00:01:16,969
Yeah, that's it.

2
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:19,804
<i>I was out there on the road</i>

3
00:02:19,805 --> 00:02:21,872
<i>Life out of control</i>

4
00:02:21,873 --> 00:02:25,409
<i>She became a victim</i>
<i>to my busy schedule</i>

5
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:26,978
<i>And I know that it's not fair</i>

6
00:02:26,978 --> 00:02:29,379
<i>That don't mean</i>
<i>that I don't care</i>

7
00:02:29,381 --> 00:02:32,817
<i>This one's dedicated</i>
<i>to the girl out there</i>

8
00:02:32,817 --> 00:02:35,287
- Okay. Good job.
- Thank you.

9
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,990
No.

10
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,990
If I shaved right now...

11
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:44,762
Shave it.

12
00:02:44,763 --> 00:02:46,396
No, I'm not doing this, bro.

13
00:02:46,397 --> 00:02:48,566
But why the mustache?

14
00:02:48,567 --> 00:02:49,933
I wanna feel
I'm grown up, you know.

15
00:02:49,935 --> 00:02:52,436
There's a phase you go
through when you think

16
00:02:52,437 --> 00:02:54,704
that the mustache actually
looks good on you.

17
00:02:54,706 --> 00:02:56,706
But, um...

18
00:02:56,808 --> 00:02:59,543
It's delusional. It's just all...
It's all delusional.

19
00:02:59,543 --> 00:03:02,479
Basically this 'stache
is to make me think

20
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:05,479
or feel a little bit older.

21
00:03:05,516 --> 00:03:08,853
See, when I can grow a full beard
like that, I'm gonna be rocking.

22
00:03:08,853 --> 00:03:11,389
But this right here,
it's coming.

23
00:03:13,592 --> 00:03:15,692
- So, um...
- You should slate this.

24
00:03:15,693 --> 00:03:16,693
Okay, let's slate it.

25
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,335
<i>When you've reached</i>
<i>a certain point in your life,</i>

26
00:03:24,336 --> 00:03:28,707
<i>there are people out there</i>
<i>who sit waiting,</i>

27
00:03:29,707 --> 00:03:31,280
<i>wanting to see you fall.</i>

28
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,848
<i>But rather than let gravity</i>
<i>take you down,</i>

29
00:03:37,848 --> 00:03:42,057
<i>sometimes you have to take
matters into your own hands...</i>

30
00:03:46,057 --> 00:03:47,491
<i>...and fly.</i>

31
00:05:22,552 --> 00:05:23,759
<i>Let's go!</i>

32
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,427
<i>What's up, Miami?</i>

33
00:05:30,427 --> 00:05:33,096
<i>How you feeling tonight?</i>

34
00:05:33,098 --> 00:05:36,637
<i>If you're ready to believe,</i>
<i>let's make some noise.</i>

35
00:05:39,637 --> 00:05:42,973
<i>You're beautiful, beautiful</i>
<i>you should know it</i>

36
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:46,709
<i>You're beautiful, beautiful</i>
<i>you should know it</i>

37
00:05:46,711 --> 00:05:48,745
<i>I think it's time</i>
<i>Think it's time</i>

38
00:05:48,747 --> 00:05:50,480
<i>That you show it</i>

39
00:05:50,481 --> 00:05:52,620
<i>You're beautiful, beautiful</i>

40
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,754
<i>Baby, what you doin'?</i>
<i>Where you at, where you at?</i>

41
00:05:57,754 --> 00:06:01,425
<i>Why you actin' so shy?</i>
<i>Holdin' back, holdin' back</i>

42
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:02,927

<i>Beyond all the lights</i>

74

<i>and, you know, the hype
and all the scrutiny</i>

75
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:37,014
<i>and the pressure,</i>
<i>at the end of the day,</i>

76
00:08:38,014 --> 00:08:42,654
it comes down to a young man
in a room writing a song.

77
00:08:44,654 --> 00:08:46,157
I don't know about you...

78
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:48,596
<i>That's where it all starts.</i>

79
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:55,165
<i>And with Justin, it starts</i>
<i>with a pad of paper and a pen</i>

80
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:57,868
<i>and a melody in his head that's
probably been there a very long time</i>

81
00:08:57,869 --> 00:08:59,937
<i>and he just needs to get it out.</i>

82
00:09:00,937 --> 00:09:02,773
<i>Music is his therapy.</i>

83
00:09:02,774 --> 00:09:04,812
<i>Music is his release.</i>

84
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:08,111
<i>If I was your boyfriend...</i>

85
00:09:08,113 --> 00:09:09,312
<i>There?</i>

86
00:09:09,312 --> 00:09:11,982
<i>If I was your boyfriend</i>
<i>I'd never let you go</i>

87
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:14,684
<i>I can take you places</i>
<i>you ain't never been before</i>

88
00:09:14,686 --> 00:09:16,854
<i>Baby, take a chance</i>
<i>or you'll never ever know</i>

89
00:09:16,855 --> 00:09:18,989
<i>I got money in my hands</i>
<i>that I'd really like to blow</i>

90
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,258
<i>Swag, swag, on you</i>

91
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:23,759
<i>Chillin' by the fire</i>
<i>while we eatin' fondue</i>

92
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,162
<i>I don't know about me</i>
<i>but I know about you</i>

93
00:09:26,163 --> 00:09:28,302
<i>So say hello to falsetto</i>
<i>in three, two</i>

94
00:09:30,302 --> 00:09:31,835
<i>Let me hear that pass.</i>

95
00:09:31,836 --> 00:09:33,596
<i>If I was your boyfriend
I'd never let you go</i>

96
00:09:34,004 --> 00:09:35,405
I've known him
for four years now.

97
00:09:35,407 --> 00:09:38,307
And when I met him,
he was just a little kid.

98
00:09:38,308 --> 00:09:41,177
Yeah, man,
yeah, man, yeah. Ready?

99
00:09:41,177 --> 00:09:43,080
It'll look like I'm gonna die.
But I'm really not gonna die.

100
00:09:43,081 --> 00:09:44,082
Just watch.

101
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:49,386
- I'm gonna do it again.
- No, no, no. You gotta shower.

102
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:51,321
- Get in the shower.
- One more time.

103
00:09:51,322 --> 00:09:53,124
Here, you take this.
I gotta go do something.

104
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:56,192
<i>It was just us, you know, in a
van going around the country.</i>

105
00:09:56,192 --> 00:09:58,828
<i>And really it started as me,</i>
<i>Ryan, Pattie and Justin.</i>

106
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,197
- Last one. Go.
- Ready?

107
00:10:02,832 --> 00:10:04,167
Fantastic.

108
00:10:04,168 --> 00:10:06,770
<i>Then it went to
the</i> My World <i> tour.</i>

109
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:10,874
And in that tour, he went
from being a kid on a stoop

110
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:13,245
who sang on YouTube to being

111
00:10:14,245 --> 00:10:16,716
a worldwide arena veteran.

112
00:10:17,716 --> 00:10:22,787
<i>I'd like to be</i>
<i>everything you want</i>

113
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:27,157
<i>Hey, girl, let me talk to you</i>

114
00:10:27,158 --> 00:10:32,296
Man, the trials of
being a teenager, period.

115
00:10:32,297 --> 00:10:35,700
I mean, it's tumultuous, but,
I mean, you just add on top

116
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:40,171
<i>of being one of the most sought
after young icons of our time.</i>

117
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:43,039
It's like a Pandora's Box.

118
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,075
<i>Justin feels a lot of pressure,</i>

119
00:10:45,076 --> 00:10:49,846
a lot of unseen pressure,
to keep outdoing himself.

120
00:10:49,846 --> 00:10:52,415
<i>There's a lot of</i>
<i>expectation on him.</i>

121
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:53,484
<i>You know, part of his childhood</i>

122
00:10:53,485 --> 00:10:55,884
was taken away from him
from working very early on,

123
00:10:55,885 --> 00:10:57,790
and, you know,
he's constantly being judged.

124
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,326
<i>He's in a constant</i>
<i>search for validation</i>

125
00:11:02,326 --> 00:11:04,160
<i>'cause everyone's just waiting.</i>

126
00:11:04,162 --> 00:11:06,562
You know, they're constantly
just waiting for it to stop.

127
00:11:07,499 --> 00:11:09,799
<i>In a weird way</i>
<i>because of doubts,</i>

128
00:11:09,801 --> 00:11:11,561
<i>we keep finding ourselves</i>
<i>the underdog.</i>

129
00:11:21,778 --> 00:11:23,913
<i>Hey, what's the situation?</i>

130
00:11:23,913 --> 00:11:26,350
<i>Whoa</i>

131
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:29,486
<i>I'm just trying to make
a little conversation</i>

132
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,788
<i>Why the hesitation?</i>

133
00:11:31,788 --> 00:11:33,224
<i>Whoa</i>

134
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:35,158

00:13:24,936 --> 00:13:27,370
Ever since those videos
on YouTube before <i> One Time.</i>

172
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:28,205
That was us.
We were the comments.

173
00:13:28,206 --> 00:13:30,407
I loved him from,
like, the beginning

174
00:13:30,408 --> 00:13:33,309
when he was making
videos on YouTube.

175
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,511
And, oh, my gosh, I don't know.
He's just so amazing.

176
00:13:35,513 --> 00:13:37,047
He's so hot.

177
00:13:37,048 --> 00:13:38,381
The haters are just jealous.

178
00:13:38,383 --> 00:13:40,049
Yeah.
And they don't...

179
00:13:40,051 --> 00:13:42,119
I don't think... They just
don't understand his music.

180
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,320
They don't.
Yeah, they just think,

181
00:13:43,321 --> 00:13:46,289
"Oh, it's Justin Bieber, he's
a guy, we can't like him."

182
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,459
But, like, that's not it. He's
a musician, not just a guy.

183
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,494
I thought he was cute last year,

184
00:13:50,495 --> 00:13:52,363
but, like, as I'm getting older

185
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:54,664
and as he's getting older,
like, oh, my God,

186
00:13:54,665 --> 00:13:56,466
he's just getting
even more cuter every day.

187
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:05,514
He's an idol for me
and really talented, so...

188
00:14:10,514 --> 00:14:12,553
- Pull up that acoustic for me, Brent.
- All right.

189
00:14:13,591 --> 00:14:15,350
<i>You know, we have</i>
<i>different relationships</i>

190
00:14:15,351 --> 00:14:16,953
<i>with different producers,</i>

191
00:14:16,955 --> 00:14:19,389
<i>the people that he goes in with
and sees if he vibes with.</i>

192
00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:23,225
<i>Mike Posner, Max Martin...</i>

193
00:14:23,226 --> 00:14:25,495
- <i> ...Will.i.am.</i>
- Can you feel it in this beat?

194
00:14:25,495 --> 00:14:27,263
Okay.
No, that's my heart, girl.

195
00:14:27,264 --> 00:14:29,264
<i>And Rodney Jerkins.</i>

196
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:37,499
<i>Working with Justin, he'll
play me 20, 30 ideas and say,</i>

197
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:41,244
"No, man, I got ideas. I got
ideas I gotta get out of me."

198
00:14:41,245 --> 00:14:43,278
And I thrive off of that
because that just shows me

199
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,615
how much he loves music.

200
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:57,628
You know, Rodney Jerkins,
that's like Michael Jackson,

201
00:14:57,629 --> 00:14:59,528
that's Mariah Carey.

202
00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:01,664
Like those are,
like, the top of the top.

203
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:04,135
<i>Like, Rodney Jerkins,</i>
<i>he's a legend.</i>

204
00:15:06,135 --> 00:15:09,440
<i>They start working and
Rodney just has this beat.</i>

205
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:12,346
<i>And he's hitting the drums</i>
<i>and he's hitting the piano.</i>

206
00:15:16,327 --> 00:15:18,648
<i>He's going back and forth</i>
<i>with the drums and the piano,</i>

207
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:20,682
<i>and Justin's vibing out
and then Justin starts,</i>

208
00:15:20,683 --> 00:15:22,352
<i>"Can I try something?</i>
<i>Can I try something?"</i>

209
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:24,356
<i>And Rodney's like,</i>
<i>"Go, go, go."</i>

210
00:15:29,894 --> 00:15:33,229
<i>And then Justin starts trying to
figure out hooks and melodies,</i>

211
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,230
<i>and then Rodney's doing</i>
<i>his hooks and his melodies.</i>

212
00:15:35,231 --> 00:15:38,735
<i>And then it just kept growing
and growing and growing.</i>

213
00:16:40,764 --> 00:16:43,667
<i>We have a responsibility
to our journey.</i>

214
00:16:43,668 --> 00:16:44,835
<i>Even though</i>
<i>you're singing a song</i>

215
00:16:44,836 --> 00:16:47,638
<i>and it's about</i>
<i>your situation in your life,</i>

216
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,572
<i>you're singing it for
everyone else to connect to.</i>

217
00:16:49,572 --> 00:16:52,075
So what you're
going through, tell it,

218
00:16:52,076 --> 00:16:53,777
tell the story,
make it come to life,

219
00:16:53,778 --> 00:16:55,745
<i>'cause that's what it's about.</i>

220
00:16:55,745 --> 00:16:58,414
Just take them
on this crazy journey.

221
00:16:58,415 --> 00:17:00,551
To get them second-guessing

222
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:02,451
and be like, "I already know
how the song's gonna end,"

223
00:17:02,452 --> 00:17:04,421
then boom, you smack them in
the face with a Filet-O-Fish,

224
00:17:04,422 --> 00:17:05,788
you know what I'm saying,

225
00:17:05,788 --> 00:17:07,490
you get white stuff all up
the side of their head.

226
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,326
So, like, that's what you wanna
do, you know what I'm saying,

227
00:17:09,326 --> 00:17:11,567
'cause they think you're hitting
them with French fries.

228
00:17:15,432 --> 00:17:17,732
A lot of times,
he kinda just starts rapping,

229
00:17:17,733 --> 00:17:19,803
and he'll just start rapping
his verses.

230
00:17:19,804 --> 00:17:21,571
And then the verses will
start coming onto the songs.

231
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:23,640
<i>Take it slow, girl</i>

232
00:17:23,641 --> 00:17:25,674
<i>'Cause things get...</i>
<i>No, girl</i>

233
00:17:25,675 --> 00:17:29,246
<i>'Cause things get crazy
up on that road</i>

234
00:17:29,247 --> 00:17:32,280
<i>He'll get a track and then</i>
<i>he'll start getting an idea.</i>

235
00:17:32,281 --> 00:17:34,351
<i>He'll write down a little bit</i>
<i>or write it down on his phone</i>

236
00:17:34,352 --> 00:17:35,352
<i>in his notepad.</i>

237
00:17:35,353 --> 00:17:37,490
<i>Hey, you are the one thing</i>

238
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:43,893
<i>It would be that I just...</i>

239
00:17:43,894 --> 00:17:45,528
And then go into, like...

240
00:17:47,632 --> 00:17:51,268
<i>I... I... I want,</i>
<i>want, want you, you, you</i>

241
00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:53,170
<i>And then he'll</i>
<i>go back on it again</i>

242
00:17:53,171 --> 00:17:54,851
<i>and he'll start putting
more words to it.</i>

243
00:17:58,576 --> 00:18:02,679
<i>I want you, you, you</i>

244
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,583
<i>I want you, you, you</i>

245
00:18:06,584 --> 00:18:09,885
<i>I want you, you, you</i>

246
00:18:09,886 --> 00:18:11,191
Okay. I just...

247
00:18:17,193 --> 00:18:20,397
<i>Don't let it get in the way</i>

248
00:18:21,397 --> 00:18:23,269
<i>Let's take it easy</i>

249
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,536
<i>Oh, oh</i>

250
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:29,272
<i>Don't let it get in the way</i>

251
00:18:30,575 --> 00:18:32,776
You know, it just
naturally kinda happened.

252
00:18:32,777 --> 00:18:34,411
You know, the song
started flowing and...

253
00:18:34,412 --> 00:18:37,346
<i>And the kids have been waiting
for</i> Believe <i> for so long.</i>

254
00:18:37,346 --> 00:18:40,415
<i>We revved up the first single, and all
they know is the name is</i> "Boyfriend."

255
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,486
- I can just guess how it goes.
- How does it go?

256
00:18:42,487 --> 00:18:44,421
<i>If I was your boyfriend...</i>

257
00:18:44,422 --> 00:18:45,354
That's exactly how it...

258
00:18:45,355 --> 00:18:46,489
<i>Never let you go</i>

259
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:47,923
That's exactly how it goes.

260
00:18:47,924 --> 00:18:49,792
<i>Ever, ever, ever let you go</i>

261
00:18:49,794 --> 00:18:50,960
That's exactly...

262
00:18:50,961 --> 00:18:52,394
<i>Girl</i>

263
00:18:52,395 --> 00:18:53,895
How did you know that?

264
00:18:53,896 --> 00:18:55,737
I'm just guessing that
that's how it would go.

265
00:18:58,836 --> 00:19:00,938
<i>I worked on</i>
<i>the record</i> Boyfriend,

266
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:03,507
<i>and originally</i>
<i>the song was gonna be called</i>

267
00:19:03,508 --> 00:19:07,710
<i>"Inside of Your Bedroom,"</i>
and I always hated that.

268
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:11,780
<i>Then we were in the studio with
Justin and, like, really hit a wall.</i>

269
00:19:11,781 --> 00:19:13,849
Like, what can we say
instead of that?

270
00:19:13,851 --> 00:19:17,688
<i>Finally we came up with,
"If I was your boyfriend."</i>

271
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:19,455
And I loved that.
I knew that was it.

272
00:19:19,457 --> 00:19:21,356
Let's do this!

273
00:19:21,357 --> 00:19:23,117
<i>And we're just in</i>
<i>full-on countdown mode.</i>

274
00:19:24,327 --> 00:19:29,432
<i>One day, 12 hours,</i>
<i>six hours, 30 minutes,</i>

275
00:19:29,432 --> 00:19:31,073
<i>seven, six, five, four,
three, two, one.</i>

276
00:19:32,001 --> 00:19:34,503
<i>If I was your boyfriend</i>
<i>I'd never let you go</i>

277
00:19:34,505 --> 00:19:36,940
<i>I can take you places</i>
<i>you ain't never been before</i>

278
00:19:36,941 --> 00:19:39,307
<i>Baby, take a chance</i>
<i>or you'll never ever know</i>

279
00:19:39,308 --> 00:19:41,545
<i>I got money in my hands</i>
<i>that I'd really like to blow</i>

280
00:19:41,546 --> 00:19:44,314
<i>Swag, swag, swag, on you</i>

281
00:19:44,315 --> 00:19:46,682
<i>Chillin' by the fire</i>
<i>while we eatin' fondue</i>

282
00:19:46,682 --> 00:19:48,951
<i>I don't know about me</i>
<i>but I know about you</i>

283
00:19:48,951 --> 00:19:50,487
<i>So say hello to falsetto</i>

284
00:19:50,488 --> 00:19:52,455
<i>In three, two...</i>

285
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:57,326
<i>I'd like to be</i>
<i>everything you want</i>

286
00:19:57,326 --> 00:20:00,596
<i>Hey, girl, let me talk to you</i>

287
00:20:00,596 --> 00:20:05,335
<i>If I was your boyfriend
I'd never let you go</i>

288
00:20:05,336 --> 00:20:09,008
<i>Keep you on my arm, girl
You'd never be alone</i>

289
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:12,576
<i>I can be a gentleman</i>

290
00:20:12,576 --> 00:20:14,744
- Your new song, that's pretty sexy.
- Oh, you like it?

291
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:16,546
I tell everybody that you're
not the Biebs anymore, man,

292
00:20:16,547 --> 00:20:18,181
you are Mr. Bieber.

293
00:20:18,182 --> 00:20:21,049
<i>Tell me about picking</i> Boyfriend
<i>as your first single.</i>

294
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:23,487
<i>I feel like every single that's
dropping is like this...</i>

295
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:24,755
<i>Right, right.</i>

296
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:26,190
<i>So I wanted to do</i>
<i>something a little different,</i>

297
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:29,326
<i>slow it down, something a
little bit more mature.</i>

298
00:20:29,326 --> 00:20:32,761
When the faders are up and you
pull all that music down,

299
00:20:32,762 --> 00:20:34,963
and all you have is that vocal,

300
00:20:34,964 --> 00:20:39,634
if it's a hit then,
then it'll be a hit always.

301
00:20:39,635 --> 00:20:40,804
<i>People absolutely</i>
<i>love the record.</i>

302
00:20:40,805 --> 00:20:43,440
<i>It debuted number one
on the Billboard charts,</i>

303
00:20:43,441 --> 00:20:48,545
and everyone really received
how his voice had matured.

304
00:20:48,546 --> 00:20:49,912
<i>Let me talk to you</i>

305
00:20:49,913 --> 00:20:54,750
<i>If I was your boyfriend
I'd never let you go</i>

306
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:59,823
<i>Keep you on my arm, girl
You'd never be alone</i>

307
00:20:59,824 --> 00:21:04,728
<i>I can be a gentleman</i>
<i>anything you want</i>

308
00:21:04,729 --> 00:21:08,400
<i>If I was your boyfriend
I'd never let you go</i>

309
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,440
<i>Never let you go</i>

310
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,477
<i>Yeah, girl</i>

311
00:21:19,477 --> 00:21:21,480
<i>If I was your boyfriend</i>

312
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,682
<i>If I was your boyfriend</i>

313
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,792
<i>There was so much talk about
what you were going to do next.</i>

314
00:21:36,794 --> 00:21:38,595
<i>I mean, everybody
in the music business,</i>

315
00:21:38,596 --> 00:21:41,896
<i>everybody in the world</i>
<i>had an opinion about it.</i>

316
00:21:41,897 --> 00:21:43,967
<i>Did you listen to all that?</i>

317
00:21:43,968 --> 00:21:45,402
<i>Did you shut the door and say,</i>

318
00:21:45,403 --> 00:21:46,635
<i>"You know what, I'm not
gonna hear any of them,</i>

319
00:21:46,636 --> 00:21:48,069
<i>"I'm just gonna focus</i>
<i>on what's inside of me?"</i>

320
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:52,107
<i>I'm the only one who can
ultimately make those decisions</i>

321
00:21:52,108 --> 00:21:54,978
<i>because, like, I'm gonna have to live
with my career for the rest of my life,</i>

322
00:21:54,979 --> 00:21:56,578
<i>so I have to make</i>
<i>those decisions,</i>

323
00:21:56,579 --> 00:21:58,816
<i>where I want my career to go.</i>

324
00:22:05,923 --> 00:22:08,923
So she was sleeping and I was
waiting till, like 12:00 a.m.,

325
00:22:08,924 --> 00:22:11,661
like, for when it
was released on iTunes.

326
00:22:11,662 --> 00:22:13,662
And right when it was released,
I called her and I was like,

327
00:22:13,663 --> 00:22:15,597
"We have to buy it.
We have to buy it right now."

328
00:22:15,598 --> 00:22:17,032
So we bought it
and we just listened to it

329
00:22:17,034 --> 00:22:18,868
together on the phone,
like, the whole time.

330
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,799
<i>Justin Bieber's album</i> Believe

331
00:22:24,008 --> 00:22:26,288
<i>scored the number one spot</i>
<i>on the Billboard 200 Chart,</i>

332
00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:30,852
<i>selling 374,000 copies</i>
<i>in the first week.</i>

333
00:22:34,852 --> 00:22:37,452
It was about making music
that was real to him,

334
00:22:37,453 --> 00:22:39,689
but that was also
real to the fans.

335
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:41,691
You know, it had to
connect emotionally.

336
00:22:41,692 --> 00:22:42,826
We were on the phone together

337
00:22:42,826 --> 00:22:44,161
and we were both crying
listening to <i> Be Alright,</i>

338
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:45,494
and we're like,
"This is the best song."

339
00:22:45,496 --> 00:22:46,694
Best song ever.

340
00:22:46,695 --> 00:22:48,029
<i>As Long As You Love Me,</i>
it's definitely the best.

341
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,030
Yeah.

342
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,839
<i>Thought of You,</i> I love that song.
That's a personal favorite.

343
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,226
Oh, my God, that's his bus.

344
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:14,825
<i>I'm psyched to play it on the radio.
This is a massive, monster hit.</i>

345
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:16,125
<i>It feels good.</i>

346
00:23:16,126 --> 00:23:19,528
<i>Girl, I'm in love</i>
<i>with the thought of you</i>

347
00:23:19,528 --> 00:23:21,864
<i>The album was out.</i>
<i>It's number one.</i>

348
00:23:21,865 --> 00:23:25,634
But at the end of the day, Justin
wants to be known as an entertainer.

349
00:23:25,634 --> 00:23:27,871
<i>You wanna be one of those artists
that every generation waits</i>

350
00:23:27,872 --> 00:23:29,471
<i>for that concert
to come to town.</i>

351
00:23:29,472 --> 00:23:32,843
<i>And we needed someone that
Justin really trusted creatively</i>

352
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:35,045
to direct our tour.

353
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:37,212
<i>That person was</i>
<i>shooting a movie.</i>

354
00:23:37,213 --> 00:23:40,915
One morning I got a call
from Scooter, and he said,

355
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:44,253
<i>"You know, last time you did a
little enhancement on his show.</i>

356
00:23:44,255 --> 00:23:47,056
"What if this time you got it
from the ground up

357
00:23:47,057 --> 00:23:48,525
"where there is
no show right now

358
00:23:48,526 --> 00:23:50,767
<i>"and you would work with
Justin to create the show?"</i>

359
00:23:51,028 --> 00:23:54,163
And we were going to force him

360
00:23:54,163 --> 00:23:56,164
<i>one way or another</i>
<i>to commit to us.</i>

361
00:23:56,165 --> 00:23:58,835
Justin called me and Scooter
kept calling me and...

362
00:23:58,836 --> 00:24:00,871
Me and Justin had a plan.

363
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:02,605
And I said, "Hey, me and
Justin are over here,

364
00:24:02,605 --> 00:24:04,605
"we're hanging out,
come over and see us."

365
00:24:04,942 --> 00:24:07,042
I'm, I'm hanging out right now.

366
00:24:07,044 --> 00:24:09,181
And, I have my friend
Nick DeMoura here.

367
00:24:10,181 --> 00:24:11,279
Hello.

368
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,084
And we have
a special announcement.

369
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:17,287
Um, Tom is back,
our production manager.

370
00:24:17,288 --> 00:24:20,722
And, um, uh... Oh, oh,
this is Justin Bieber.

371
00:24:20,723 --> 00:24:23,159
What's up, everybody?
I'm Justin.

372
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,162
And as soon as he got there, Justin
and I just completely cornered him.

373
00:24:26,163 --> 00:24:27,663
They said, "You're not
leaving this house

374
00:24:27,663 --> 00:24:29,900
"until you agree
to do this show."

375
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:31,201
And, Justin, we have
a special announcement

376
00:24:31,201 --> 00:24:33,067
- about the <i> Believe</i> tour.
- What is it?

377
00:24:33,068 --> 00:24:34,630
Well, I think
someone's just joining on

378
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:37,273
officially to come and help
us creatively direct it.

379
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:38,575
No, really?

380
00:24:38,576 --> 00:24:39,709
Yeah, yeah,
to creatively direct it.

381
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,176
- No. Who did?
- Who did what?

382
00:24:41,177 --> 00:24:43,278
- Why don't you sit down over there.
- Maybe it's Jon Chu.

383
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,846
- Jonathan M. Chu.
- Hello.

384
00:24:44,847 --> 00:24:46,615
What's up, everybody?

385
00:24:46,615 --> 00:24:49,552
And then Justin was like, "So
are you in or are you not?"

386
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:50,875
I said, "Well, I don't know yet.

387
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:51,822
"I gotta figure out my schedule.

388
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,855
"I gotta see
your guys' schedule."

389
00:24:53,856 --> 00:24:55,825
He's like, "Jon, you're not leaving
this until you say you're in."

390
00:24:55,826 --> 00:24:58,896
Jon has a problem
saying no to Justin.

391
00:25:00,896 --> 00:25:02,833
Oh, my God.

392
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:17,949
Can I open this one now?

393
00:25:24,153 --> 00:25:26,153
What do you got?

394
00:25:26,757 --> 00:25:29,626
She's crying
with tears of joy, right?

395
00:25:30,626 --> 00:25:31,626
Let me see.

396
00:25:40,769 --> 00:25:42,875
Tears of joy.

397
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:46,913
Oh, my God.

398
00:25:48,913 --> 00:25:50,380
Catherine, let me see.

399
00:25:50,381 --> 00:25:52,683
- Live Justin Bieber tickets.
- What is it?

400
00:26:05,162 --> 00:26:07,130
<i>Say you love me</i>

401
00:26:07,131 --> 00:26:10,365
<i>As much as I love you, yeah</i>

402
00:26:10,366 --> 00:26:13,635
<i>Would you hurt me, baby?</i>

403
00:26:13,636 --> 00:26:16,138
<i>Could you do that to me, yeah?</i>

404
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:19,173
<i>Would you lie to me, baby?</i>

405
00:26:19,174 --> 00:26:21,744
<i>'Cause the truth hurts</i>
<i>so much more</i>

406
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,016
<i>Would you do the things
that drive me crazy?</i>

407
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:27,349
<i>Leave my heart</i>
<i>still at the door?</i>

408
00:26:27,351 --> 00:26:30,220
<i>Oh, I can't help it</i>
<i>I'm just selfish</i>

409
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:33,221
<i>There's no way</i>
<i>that I could share you</i>

410
00:26:33,222 --> 00:26:35,857
<i>That would break</i>
<i>my heart to pieces</i>

411
00:26:35,858 --> 00:26:37,992
<i>Honestly the truth is</i>

412
00:26:37,993 --> 00:26:41,165
<i>If I could just die in your arms</i>

413
00:26:43,165 --> 00:26:46,301
<i>I wouldn't mind</i>

414
00:26:46,302 --> 00:26:48,938
<i>'Cause every time you touch me</i>

415
00:26:48,939 --> 00:26:53,910
<i>I just die in your arms</i>

416
00:26:53,911 --> 00:26:57,447
<i>Ooh, it feels so right</i>

417
00:26:57,448 --> 00:26:59,786
<i>So, baby, baby,
please don't stop, girl</i>

418
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,390
<i>Music is
what brings us together.</i>

419
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:09,959
<i>I can't tell you how many friends
I've made because of music.</i>

420
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,394
<i>Oh, if there is a reason...</i>

421
00:27:12,394 --> 00:27:13,997
<i>Music is a universal language</i>

422
00:27:13,998 --> 00:27:16,432
that could describe
any moment in life.

423
00:27:16,432 --> 00:27:17,866
<i>I hear a certain song,</i>

424
00:27:17,867 --> 00:27:21,903
<i>it reminds me of my first
heartbreak, first love.</i>

425
00:27:21,904 --> 00:27:24,374
<i>As any human being,</i>
<i>you've heard a song</i>

426
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:27,410
and it catches you
and it's a visceral reaction.

427
00:27:27,411 --> 00:27:29,878
<i>Your mind isn't doing
any work, but your gut,</i>

428
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,146
<i>your heart, your soul,</i>
<i>whatever you wanna call it,</i>

429
00:27:32,147 --> 00:27:33,215
<i>it feels it.</i>

430
00:27:33,217 --> 00:27:35,019
<i>Oh, I can't help it</i>
<i>I'm just selfish</i>

431
00:27:36,019 --> 00:27:38,021
<i>There's no way</i>
<i>that I could share you</i>

432
00:27:39,021 --> 00:27:41,324
<i>That would break</i>
<i>my heart to pieces</i>

433
00:27:41,325 --> 00:27:43,826
<i>Honestly the truth is</i>

434
00:27:43,826 --> 00:27:45,346
<i>If I could just</i>
<i>die in your arms...</i>

435
00:27:46,028 --> 00:27:48,797
<i>I love music.</i>
<i>I love making music.</i>

436
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:51,835
I like making music that
travels all around the world.

437
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:54,470
<i>And people are all in</i>
<i>different countries,</i>

438
00:27:54,471 --> 00:27:57,773
<i>Mexico, London, France,
all over the world</i>

439
00:27:57,775 --> 00:27:59,342
<i>are singing the lyrics.</i>

440
00:27:59,343 --> 00:28:01,111
<i>They might not even</i>
<i>know how to speak English,</i>

441
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:03,511
but they're singing
those lyrics.

442
00:28:03,512 --> 00:28:04,950
That's what it's about.

443
00:28:07,416 --> 00:28:11,295
<i>If I could die...</i>

444
00:28:23,365 --> 00:28:25,404
<i>Don't stop, baby, no</i>

445
00:28:29,404 --> 00:28:31,941
<i>It's what you do to me</i>

446
00:28:31,942 --> 00:28:34,980
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

447
00:28:48,057 --> 00:28:49,490
<i>Have you been in love?</i>

448
00:28:49,491 --> 00:28:51,994
Have I been...
Of course I've been in love.

449
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:55,933
Um, I think being in love is
the most powerful thing ever.

450
00:28:57,933 --> 00:29:00,269
It's an extreme feeling,
being in love.

451
00:29:00,269 --> 00:29:02,173
Have you ever had heartbreak?

452
00:29:03,173 --> 00:29:06,075
Yes, yes, definitely.

453
00:29:06,076 --> 00:29:08,210
That's...

454
00:29:08,211 --> 00:29:11,017
That's even, I would say, it's
about just the same feeling.

455
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:15,118
As much as it is
to fall in love,

456
00:29:16,118 --> 00:29:17,520
like, in that...

457
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,155
It's that explosiveness,
that fire,

458
00:29:21,156 --> 00:29:24,961
just when you break up from that,
if you give them everything,

459
00:29:25,961 --> 00:29:28,098
and you break up
from that, you're...

460
00:29:30,098 --> 00:29:31,432
It's the same type...

461
00:29:31,433 --> 00:29:34,436
It's like that
clenching feeling like...

462
00:29:34,438 --> 00:29:36,439
Oh, like, when you...
This is my feeling.

463
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,040
Like, "Oh, I love her
so much."

464
00:29:39,041 --> 00:29:42,614
But then that's the same feeling
when we break up, it's like,

465
00:29:43,614 --> 00:29:46,914
"Oh, like, this hurts.
This hurts so deep."

466
00:29:46,915 --> 00:29:49,854
It's just the same emotion,
but, uh, flipped backwards.

467
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:56,551
<i>I'm here at Justin Bieber's
world tour audition.</i>

468
00:30:56,552 --> 00:30:57,987
<i>This is the first time</i>
<i>he's using girls,</i>

469
00:30:57,988 --> 00:31:03,258
so I feel pretty honored to hopefully
be one of the first to do that.

470
00:31:03,259 --> 00:31:08,564
<i>Over there are a bunch of lovely
ladies fighting for the gig.</i>

471
00:31:08,565 --> 00:31:11,365
<i>And there's limited spots,</i>
<i>so it's pretty nerve-racking</i>

472
00:31:11,366 --> 00:31:12,969
<i>standing next to a good friend</i>

473
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:15,136
<i>and knowing that one of you may
make it, and one of you may not.</i>

474
00:31:15,137 --> 00:31:19,240
Move, cha, pa, boom, boom, hold!
Move, ba, da, da, hold.

475
00:31:19,241 --> 00:31:21,545
Pop, pop, shoo, pop, pop,
pop, pop, pop, hold.

476
00:31:30,953 --> 00:31:31,953
Let's go!

477
00:31:33,088 --> 00:31:34,722
Let's go!

478
00:31:34,723 --> 00:31:37,161
Five, six... Eight.

479
00:31:46,702 --> 00:31:48,569
Hold... Whoa!

480
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:50,672
This is something that has
been itching on the inside.

481
00:31:50,673 --> 00:31:53,508
Like, I've never really
been on a tour before.

482
00:31:53,509 --> 00:31:56,412
And this would be
such a dream come true.

483
00:31:56,413 --> 00:31:58,480
<i>I'm getting older</i>
<i>and I feel like</i>

484
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,449
<i>if there's one time to do it,</i>

485
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,249
<i>if there's one moment to have,</i>

486
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,652
it'd be this one here.

487
00:32:02,653 --> 00:32:04,453
Here we go.
Let's get cracking.

488
00:32:21,171 --> 00:32:24,151
Justin just came in. Yeah,
so no pressure, you know.

489
00:32:34,151 --> 00:32:36,750
I just was, like, so in there. I
was like, "I want this so bad."

490
00:32:41,325 --> 00:32:42,423
<i>So I was really nervous,</i>

491
00:32:42,424 --> 00:32:44,595
<i>but I worked so hard</i>
<i>at that audition.</i>

492
00:33:02,972 --> 00:33:04,814
<i>I was fortunate enough
to work with him before</i>

493
00:33:04,815 --> 00:33:07,150
on the promo tour,
and I see how he works

494
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,750
and how dedicated he is

495
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,553
<i>and how involved he</i>
<i>is with his music.</i>

496
00:33:10,554 --> 00:33:12,386
<i>It's not people just
telling him what to do.</i>

497
00:33:12,387 --> 00:33:14,221
<i>It's really coming from him.</i>

498
00:33:14,222 --> 00:33:16,726
<i>So it'd be such an honor</i>
<i>to be a part of his growth</i>

499
00:33:16,727 --> 00:33:19,095
<i>and watch his journey.</i>

500
00:33:19,096 --> 00:33:20,363
<i>Here, brother.</i>

501
00:33:20,364 --> 00:33:23,532
Hey, CJ. It's, uh, Jon Chu.

502
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:25,701
Most jobs, you don't get a
personal call like that.

503
00:33:25,701 --> 00:33:27,568
So when that happened,
it really, like,

504
00:33:27,569 --> 00:33:29,337
I really feel like
I earned my spot.

505
00:33:40,298 --> 00:33:42,218
I remember your exact words.
You were like...

506
00:33:42,219 --> 00:33:44,221
You got the job.
You're going on the tour.

507
00:33:45,221 --> 00:33:46,422
<i>Are you serious?</i>

508
00:33:46,423 --> 00:33:47,690
I was, like, screaming.

509
00:33:47,691 --> 00:33:49,659
I was like, uh, just tears.

510
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,192
<i>I'm so excited</i>
<i>to work with you, Jon.</i>

511
00:33:51,193 --> 00:33:53,260
<i>- I'm so excited.</i>
- Me, too.

512
00:33:53,261 --> 00:33:56,530
And then that moment that
it became ours, it was,

513
00:33:56,531 --> 00:33:59,269
I mean, yeah,
completely indescribable.

514
00:34:07,897 --> 00:34:09,177
I think he just started crying.

515
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:10,179
I think he was crying.

516
00:34:11,481 --> 00:34:13,748
We made him cry, yes.

517
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:16,251
<i>- Make your dreams come true
- True</i>

518
00:34:16,253 --> 00:34:18,186
<i>Miami...</i>

519
00:34:18,188 --> 00:34:20,454
<i>I need you to put</i>
<i>your hands in the air,</i>

520
00:34:20,456 --> 00:34:23,201
<i>right now, hands up!</i>

521
00:34:31,201 --> 00:34:32,603
<i>Show you off</i>

522
00:34:33,603 --> 00:34:36,273
<i>Tonight I wanna show you off</i>

523
00:34:38,407 --> 00:34:41,275
<i>What you got</i>

524
00:34:41,277 --> 00:34:42,717
<i>A billion could've never bought</i>

525
00:34:46,416 --> 00:34:50,251
<i>We gonna party</i>
<i>like it's 3012 tonight</i>

526
00:34:50,253 --> 00:34:53,788
<i>I wanna show you</i>
<i>all the finer things in life</i>

527
00:34:53,789 --> 00:34:55,856
<i>So just forget about the world</i>

528
00:34:55,858 --> 00:34:57,726
<i>We're young tonight</i>

529
00:34:57,728 --> 00:35:00,262
<i>I'm coming for ya</i>
<i>I'm coming for ya</i>

530
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:04,936
<i>'Cause all I need</i>

531
00:35:05,936 --> 00:35:09,637
<i>Is a beauty and a beat</i>

532
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:11,773
<i>Who can make my life complete</i>

533
00:35:11,775 --> 00:35:13,411
<i>Once again, Miami,
hands up right now.</i>

534
00:35:15,411 --> 00:35:16,443
<i>Let's go.</i>

535
00:35:16,445 --> 00:35:19,380
<i>It's all about you</i>

536
00:35:19,382 --> 00:35:21,182
<i>Hands up.</i>

537
00:35:21,184 --> 00:35:23,621
<i>When the music makes you move</i>

538
00:35:24,621 --> 00:35:28,527
<i>Baby, do it like you do...</i>

539
00:35:31,527 --> 00:35:34,262
<i>We had about eight or 12 weeks
to put this show together.</i>

540
00:35:34,264 --> 00:35:37,731
<i>We had to build custom sets</i>
<i>and design the costumes</i>

541
00:35:37,733 --> 00:35:39,634
<i>and the music.
In the middle of it all,</i>

542
00:35:39,635 --> 00:35:41,101
<i>Scooter and Justin</i>
<i>came to me, they're like,</i>

543
00:35:41,103 --> 00:35:44,371
"Hey, we're gonna shoot this music
video for <i> Beauty and A Beat."</i>

544
00:35:44,373 --> 00:35:46,240
"Oh, that's great,
have fun."

545
00:35:46,242 --> 00:35:48,543
<i>Scooter said, "I don't
think you understand.</i>

546
00:35:48,545 --> 00:35:51,681
<i>"We'd really love it if you
were to help Justin direct it."</i>

547
00:35:52,681 --> 00:35:55,717
I said, "What?"

548
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:57,385
<i>All right.</i>
<i>No peeing in the water.</i>

549
00:35:57,387 --> 00:35:59,893
So five, six, seven, eight.

550
00:36:07,563 --> 00:36:08,563
One more time, sorry.

551
00:36:09,431 --> 00:36:10,871
One, two, three, four.

552
00:36:14,871 --> 00:36:17,505
It's all in his hands
'cause he's the one

553
00:36:17,507 --> 00:36:19,474
<i>who's holding the camera,</i>
<i>shooting the thing,</i>

554
00:36:19,476 --> 00:36:20,809
<i>directing the thing.</i>

555
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:22,777
<i>And he's dancing
in between all of that.</i>

556
00:36:22,778 --> 00:36:24,278
<i>Yes.</i>

557
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,313
<i>And we have, like, 50 dancers,</i>

558
00:36:25,315 --> 00:36:26,748
<i>synchronized swimmers</i>
<i>on the side,</i>

559
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,483
<i>people flipping into the water.</i>

560
00:36:28,485 --> 00:36:31,987
<i>We gonna party</i>
<i>like it's 3012 tonight</i>

561
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:35,789
<i>I wanna show you</i>
<i>all the finer things in life</i>

562
00:36:35,791 --> 00:36:37,791
<i>So just forget about the world</i>

563
00:36:37,793 --> 00:36:39,693
<i>We're young tonight</i>

564
00:36:39,695 --> 00:36:42,630
<i>I'm coming for ya</i>
<i>I'm coming for ya</i>

565
00:36:42,632 --> 00:36:43,632
<i>'Cause all...</i>

566
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:45,733
Nicki Minaj will be there.

567
00:36:45,735 --> 00:36:46,967
We're gonna throw her
in the water.

568
00:36:46,969 --> 00:36:48,235
Uh, I'm just kidding.

569
00:36:48,237 --> 00:36:50,947
I wanna know how Nicki Minaj
is gonna get on that platform.

570
00:36:57,239 --> 00:36:59,880
I feel like there's a lot of things
we haven't thought about yet.

571
00:36:59,882 --> 00:37:01,650
We should probably
harness her in somehow.

572
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:03,050
- Just lift her.
- Yeah.

573
00:37:03,052 --> 00:37:05,487
<i>When the music makes you move</i>

574
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:09,628
<i>Baby, do it like you do</i>

575
00:37:11,628 --> 00:37:13,528
<i>In time, ink lines</i>

576
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,362
<i>Bitches couldn't get</i>
<i>on my incline</i>

577
00:37:15,364 --> 00:37:17,365
<i>World tours, it's mine</i>

578
00:37:17,367 --> 00:37:18,967
<i>Ten little letters on a big sign</i>

579
00:37:18,969 --> 00:37:22,737
<i>Justin Bieber, you know</i>
<i>I'mma hit 'em with the ether</i>

580
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:24,639
<i>Buns out, wiener</i>

581
00:37:24,641 --> 00:37:26,641
<i>But I gotta keep</i>
<i>an eye out for Selena</i>

582
00:37:26,643 --> 00:37:27,742
<i>Beauty, beauty and the beast</i>

583
00:37:27,744 --> 00:37:28,809
<i>Beauty from the east</i>

584
00:37:28,811 --> 00:37:30,478
<i>Beautiful confessions</i>
<i>of the priest</i>

585
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,746
<i>Beast, beauty from the streets</i>

586
00:37:31,748 --> 00:37:32,746
<i>We don't get deceased</i>

587
00:37:32,748 --> 00:37:34,416
<i>Every time a beauty on the beats</i>

588
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,684
<i>Body rock, oh</i>

589
00:37:36,686 --> 00:37:39,987
<i>I wanna feel your body rock</i>

590
00:37:39,989 --> 00:37:41,556
<i>Raise your hands up, let's go.</i>

591
00:37:41,556 --> 00:37:42,760
<i>'Cause all</i>

592
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:49,400
<i>I need is a beauty and a beat</i>

593
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,771
<i>Who can make my life complete</i>

594
00:37:55,771 --> 00:37:56,771
<i>'Cause...</i>

595
00:38:12,054 --> 00:38:13,989
Here he comes,
here he comes. Yeah.

596
00:38:19,949 --> 00:38:21,429
<i>And everyone's</i>
<i>cheering at the end.</i>

597
00:38:21,431 --> 00:38:23,465
<i>That is true, true joy</i>

598
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:26,501
because everyone's
so tired and excited

599
00:38:26,503 --> 00:38:28,603
<i>that Justin got to direct</i>
<i>his first music video.</i>

600
00:38:28,605 --> 00:38:30,105
That's awesome.

601
00:38:30,106 --> 00:38:35,106
<i>Justin Bieber.</i>

602
00:38:56,967 --> 00:38:57,967
Yeah!

603
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,152
Oh, my God.

604
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:18,920
- Hannah?
- Hey, that's enough.

605
00:39:18,922 --> 00:39:21,159
You got me tickets
to Justin Bieber!

606
00:39:23,726 --> 00:39:24,726
Okay. That's enough.

607
00:39:38,802 --> 00:39:40,041
<i>When I start choreographing,</i>

608
00:39:40,043 --> 00:39:42,614
<i>I just try to hear
what the song is about.</i>

609
00:39:44,394 --> 00:39:46,914
<i>I try not to, like, control the
song, what I want it to do.</i>

610
00:39:46,916 --> 00:39:48,750
The song was there before I was,

611
00:39:48,751 --> 00:39:50,152
<i>so I let it move me.</i>

612
00:39:50,153 --> 00:39:52,922
<i>I try to, like, show you what</i>
<i>the song should look like.</i>

613
00:40:05,534 --> 00:40:07,702
This show is crazy.
We rehearsed, you know,

614
00:40:07,704 --> 00:40:09,838
12-hour days, you know, for
about two months straight

615
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,840
<i>with Justin.</i>

616
00:40:12,175 --> 00:40:13,878
Hey, not like that.

617
00:40:14,878 --> 00:40:17,545
- Zoop. Zoop.
- Yeah!

618
00:40:17,547 --> 00:40:19,646
- All right. I'm good.
- Zoop, yeah.

619
00:40:19,648 --> 00:40:21,648
Hoorah, baby.

620
00:40:24,673 --> 00:40:26,153
I think the hardest
part was taking it

621
00:40:26,155 --> 00:40:28,655
from the dance studio
to the actual set,

622
00:40:28,657 --> 00:40:31,793
<i>and the actual toaster lifts</i>
<i>and the actual fly gags</i>

623
00:40:31,795 --> 00:40:33,894
<i>and timing-wise and
transitioning everything,</i>

624
00:40:33,896 --> 00:40:35,929
<i>I think that was</i>
<i>the hardest part.</i>

625
00:40:35,931 --> 00:40:37,231
And I'm going up
while this is playing?

626
00:40:37,233 --> 00:40:39,833
<i>Justin, he had a lot more input.</i>

627
00:40:39,835 --> 00:40:42,103
<i>Here he had his own ideas</i>
<i>he wanted to contribute,</i>

628
00:40:42,105 --> 00:40:44,771
so it's a lot more of him
giving himself to his fans,

629
00:40:44,773 --> 00:40:46,893
um, which makes the show
a lot more personal to him.

630
00:40:52,547 --> 00:40:54,949
Being young and in the industry,

631
00:40:54,951 --> 00:40:57,989
there's a lot of things that
people tell you to say, right?

632
00:40:58,822 --> 00:41:00,021
The music that I'm making now,

633
00:41:00,023 --> 00:41:01,789
it's all creatively
coming from me,

634
00:41:01,791 --> 00:41:03,224
and I wanna do what I want.

635
00:41:03,226 --> 00:41:06,094
Like, if I'm not happy
with what I wanna do

636
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:08,266
and who I wanna be, then who...

637
00:41:10,266 --> 00:41:12,869
I'm not gonna be happy.

638
00:41:13,869 --> 00:41:16,137
<i>We talked a lot about</i>
<i>what does this album mean.</i>

639
00:41:16,139 --> 00:41:18,773
And he says, "You know what, a
lot of people want me to fail."

640
00:41:18,775 --> 00:41:19,875
But he's like,
"That doesn't bother me.

641
00:41:19,876 --> 00:41:21,876
<i>"'Cause no matter what,
my fans are there</i>

642
00:41:21,878 --> 00:41:23,278
<i>"and they'll make me fly."</i>

643
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,945
And that really triggered,
in my mind, like,

644
00:41:24,947 --> 00:41:26,507
"All right, we're gonna
make you fly."

645
00:41:27,181 --> 00:41:29,684
<i>You're gonna come in</i>
<i>and you're gonna fly.</i>

646
00:41:29,686 --> 00:41:32,086
<i>With the cheers of your audience,
they're gonna keep you up,</i>

647
00:41:32,088 --> 00:41:36,157
<i>and you're gonna fly in on wings made of
instruments because it's your talent.</i>

648
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:37,826
<i>And instruments,</i>
<i>not just random instruments,</i>

649
00:41:37,827 --> 00:41:39,293
<i>but instruments that you play.</i>

650
00:41:39,295 --> 00:41:41,128
<i>So we have drums.</i>
<i>We have keyboards.</i>

651
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:43,164
<i>We have all these things
that he plays</i>

652
00:41:43,166 --> 00:41:45,300
<i>built into these wings</i>
<i>to symbolize</i>

653
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:47,969
<i>that he's built of</i>
<i>many, many parts.</i>

654
00:41:47,971 --> 00:41:50,172
<i>That's what makes him</i>
<i>Justin Bieber.</i>

655
00:41:54,978 --> 00:41:56,284
<i>As long as you love me</i>

656
00:42:01,284 --> 00:42:03,851
<i>As long as you love me</i>

657
00:42:03,853 --> 00:42:05,987
<i>We're under pressure</i>

658
00:42:05,989 --> 00:42:09,659
<i>Seven billion people in the
world trying to fit in</i>

659
00:42:10,659 --> 00:42:12,860
<i>Keep it together</i>

660
00:42:12,862 --> 00:42:17,065
<i>Smile on your face even</i>
<i>though your heart is frowning</i>

661
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:20,335
<i>But hey now, you know, girl</i>

662
00:42:20,335 --> 00:42:23,905
<i>We both know it's a cruel world</i>

663
00:42:23,907 --> 00:42:27,878
<i>But I will take my chances</i>

664
00:42:28,878 --> 00:42:30,014
<i>As long as you love me</i>

665
00:42:31,014 --> 00:42:34,148
<i>We could be starving</i>
<i>We could be homeless</i>

666
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:35,951
<i>We could be broke</i>

668
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,989
<i>I'll be your platinum</i>

673
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,710
<i>I'll be your soldier</i>

674
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:04,878
<i>Fighting every second of the day</i>

675

<i>For your dreams, girl</i>

676
00:43:06,849 --> 00:43:09,384
<i>I'll be your Hova</i>

677
00:43:09,385 --> 00:43:11,719
<i>You could be my Destiny's Child</i>

678
00:43:11,721 --> 00:43:13,820
<i>On the scene, girl</i>

679
00:43:13,822 --> 00:43:15,289
<i>But don't stress</i>

680
00:43:15,291 --> 00:43:16,858
<i>And don't cry</i>

681
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:20,728
<i>No, we don't need</i>
<i>no wings to fly</i>

682
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:24,802
<i>Just take my hand</i>

683
00:43:25,802 --> 00:43:27,367
<i>As long as you love me</i>

684
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:30,972

<i>Yo, B-I-G</i>

692
00:43:54,697 --> 00:43:56,264
<i>I don't know if this makes sense</i>

693
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:59,099
<i>But you're my hallelujah</i>

694
00:43:59,101 --> 00:44:01,034
<i>Give me a time and place,</i>
<i>I'll rendezvous it</i>

695
00:44:01,036 --> 00:44:02,804
<i>I'll fly you to it,</i>
<i>I'll beat you there</i>

696

<i>Girl, you know I got you</i>

697
00:44:04,273 --> 00:44:05,273
<i>Us, trust...</i>

698
00:44:05,896 --> 00:44:07,775
<i>A couple of things</i>
<i>I can't spell without "u"</i>

699
00:44:07,777 --> 00:44:09,077
<i>Now we are on top of the world</i>

700
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:10,878
<i>'Cause that's just how we do</i>

701
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,346
<i>Used to tell me sky's the limit</i>

702
00:44:12,347 --> 00:44:14,282
<i>Now the sky's our point of view</i>

703
00:44:14,284 --> 00:44:16,284
<i>We'll be stepping out like, whoa</i>

704
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:17,885
<i>Cameras point and shoot</i>

705
00:44:17,887 --> 00:44:19,320
<i>Ask me what's my best side</i>

706
00:44:19,322 --> 00:44:21,355
<i>I stand back and point at you</i>

707
00:44:21,356 --> 00:44:22,789
<i>You, you the one</i>
<i>that I argue with</i>

708
00:44:22,791 --> 00:44:24,958
<i>I feel like I need a new
girl to be bothered with</i>

709
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,028
<i>But the grass ain't always
greener on the other side</i>

710
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:28,295
<i>It's green where you water it</i>

711
00:44:28,297 --> 00:44:29,963
<i>So I know we got issues, baby</i>

712
00:44:29,965 --> 00:44:31,365
<i>True, true, true</i>

713
00:44:31,367 --> 00:44:32,927
<i>But I'd rather work</i>
<i>on this with you</i>

714
00:44:33,001 --> 00:44:34,802
<i>Than to go ahead
and start with someone new</i>

715
00:44:34,804 --> 00:44:36,237
<i>As long as you love me</i>

716
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:39,373
<i>We could be starving</i>
<i>We could be homeless</i>

717
00:44:39,375 --> 00:44:40,375

<i>As long as you love me</i>

735
00:46:16,539 --> 00:46:19,106
<i>We could be starving</i>

<i>We could be homeless</i>

737
00:46:22,143 --> 00:46:23,148
<i>We could be broke</i>

738
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:28,204
Justin!

739
00:46:48,204 --> 00:46:52,173
<i>Baby, baby, baby, oh</i>

740
00:46:52,175 --> 00:46:55,280
<i>Six-year-old Avalanna Routh</i>
<i>is a huge Justin Bieber fan.</i>

741
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,481
<i>And now there's a Facebook page</i>

742
00:47:00,483 --> 00:47:04,985
<i>dedicated to trying to get her
to meet the pop superstar.</i>

743
00:47:04,987 --> 00:47:08,188
<i>Avalanna had become</i>
<i>Mrs. Bieber at her hospital.</i>

744
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:10,157
<i>She had a rare disease.</i>

745
00:47:10,159 --> 00:47:13,159
She loved Justin and they got
a cardboard cutout of Justin.

746
00:47:13,161 --> 00:47:15,429
<i>And she had a whole fake
wedding at her hospital</i>

747
00:47:15,431 --> 00:47:16,590
<i>with this cardboard cutout.</i>

748
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,166
<i>And it was</i>
<i>on the news in Boston.</i>

749
00:47:19,168 --> 00:47:21,903
<i>And I was just blown away.</i>
<i>She was adorable.</i>

750
00:47:21,905 --> 00:47:23,538
<i>So I called Justin.</i>
<i>He said, "Let's meet her.</i>

751
00:47:23,539 --> 00:47:25,239
<i>"I'm gonna be</i>
<i>in New York next week.</i>

752
00:47:25,239 --> 00:47:27,641
<i>"Let's bring her</i>
<i>down from Boston."</i>

753
00:47:27,643 --> 00:47:29,644
<i>And, you know, it was supposed
to be a quick meet and greet,</i>

754
00:47:29,646 --> 00:47:31,550
<i>and he ended up
spending hours with her.</i>

755
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:36,384
I met with her and it wasn't...
It wasn't normal.

756
00:47:36,385 --> 00:47:37,918
It was different.

757
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,686
It wasn't like I was
just meeting another fan.

758
00:47:39,688 --> 00:47:41,489
It was like...
It was so special.

759
00:47:41,489 --> 00:47:43,490
<i>I sat down. I played</i>
<i>board games with her.</i>

760
00:47:43,492 --> 00:47:45,929
I thought she was
super adorable.

761
00:47:46,929 --> 00:47:49,429
<i>It is.</i>

762
00:47:49,431 --> 00:47:51,500
<i>And they got really, really
close like a big brother,</i>

763
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:53,534
<i>but she called him her husband.</i>

764
00:47:53,536 --> 00:47:55,336
<i>And he called her</i>
<i>Mrs. Bieber.</i>

765
00:47:55,338 --> 00:47:56,699
- Name is?
- She is Mrs. Bieber.

766
00:47:57,005 --> 00:47:58,806
And basically she had
her own little wedding

767
00:47:59,007 --> 00:48:00,675
- at the hospital.
- Yeah.

768
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:02,976
She was like,
"You're my husband,

769
00:48:02,978 --> 00:48:05,045
"so my mom's
your mother-in-law."

770
00:48:05,047 --> 00:48:08,954
And she's so little and it's
like, "Wow, she's so cute."

771
00:48:15,056 --> 00:48:17,590
Ducks, ducks, ducks.
Quack, quack, quack.

772
00:48:17,592 --> 00:48:19,628
Smooth.

773
00:48:50,592 --> 00:48:54,228
Avalanna put her hands over her
ears and he was singing to her.

774
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:55,429
And then he goes, "What's
wrong?" And she goes,

775
00:48:55,431 --> 00:48:57,630
"It's so loud in here.
Why are they screaming?

776
00:48:57,632 --> 00:48:59,567
"You're my husband."

777
00:48:59,568 --> 00:49:01,605
<i>What, are they...
Are they just really loud?</i>

778
00:49:02,605 --> 00:49:04,204
<i>They're very loud.</i>

779
00:49:04,206 --> 00:49:05,472
<i>They're very loud.</i>

780
00:49:05,474 --> 00:49:07,442
<i>But that's a good thing.</i>

781
00:49:07,443 --> 00:49:08,809
<i>That's a good thing</i>
<i>because that just means</i>

782
00:49:08,811 --> 00:49:10,811
<i>they're really supportive fans.</i>

783
00:49:12,148 --> 00:49:14,414
<i>Yeah.</i>

784
00:49:14,416 --> 00:49:16,496
<i>So, we're gonna get</i>
<i>you back over there to Mom.</i>

785
00:49:17,018 --> 00:49:18,552
<i>But did you have fun up here?</i>

786
00:49:18,554 --> 00:49:21,755
<i>Yeah, I have to wear earphones.</i>

787
00:49:21,757 --> 00:49:23,557
<i>Okay.</i>

788
00:49:23,559 --> 00:49:26,793
<i>Okay. Well, we'll get you another
pair of earphones side stage, okay,</i>

789
00:49:26,795 --> 00:49:29,329
<i>and you can watch</i>
<i>the rest of the show?</i>

790
00:49:29,331 --> 00:49:31,032
<i>Is that gonna be cool?</i>

791
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:32,199
<i>Yeah?</i>

792
00:49:32,201 --> 00:49:34,268
<i>Wanna give me a hug?</i>

793
00:49:36,172 --> 00:49:38,239
<i>Okay. We'll get you</i>
<i>some earphones, sweetie.</i>

794
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:40,673
<i>Come on, let's go.</i>

795
00:49:40,675 --> 00:49:42,275
I love him.

796
00:49:42,277 --> 00:49:43,277
That was so cute.

797
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:47,315
That was adorable.
Oh, my God.

798
00:50:00,262 --> 00:50:01,262
<i>And, uh...</i>

799
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:05,298
<i>I'm sorry...</i>

800
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:06,637
Oh, my God.

801
00:50:08,637 --> 00:50:10,822
<i>It's just like...</i>

802
00:50:26,822 --> 00:50:30,126
<i>But... Give a round of
applause for Avalanna.</i>

803
00:50:32,628 --> 00:50:33,628
<i>Then slowly...</i>

804
00:50:36,532 --> 00:50:38,105
...her talking,
her speech...

805
00:50:42,105 --> 00:50:44,737
...started to slow down.

806
00:50:44,739 --> 00:50:48,246
And her eye started
shutting on her left side.

807
00:50:50,246 --> 00:50:51,246
<i>And, um...</i>

808
00:50:59,155 --> 00:51:00,528
<i>It was just...</i>

809
00:51:06,528 --> 00:51:08,505
It was just hard to see.

810
00:51:15,505 --> 00:51:16,505
But...

811
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:26,351
I miss her, bro.

812
00:51:42,498 --> 00:51:45,666
<i>Our first show, Avalanna unfortunately
died just four days earlier,</i>

813
00:51:45,668 --> 00:51:47,735
<i>and all of us were feeling it.</i>

814
00:51:47,737 --> 00:51:51,239
<i>Tonight's</i> Lonely Girl
<i>is super special</i>

815
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:53,478
<i>because, um...</i>

816
00:51:55,478 --> 00:51:57,481
<i>This song is dedicated</i>

817
00:51:58,481 --> 00:52:00,387
<i>to, um, to sweet Avalanna.</i>

818
00:52:04,387 --> 00:52:06,855
<i>So, um...</i>

819
00:52:06,856 --> 00:52:10,960
<i>Avalanna, if you're listening,
I love you.</i>

820
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:16,231
<i>And everyone... Everyone
in here loves you as well.</i>

821
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:20,603
<i>So, um, this one's for you.</i>

822
00:52:23,873 --> 00:52:26,507
<i>One less lonely girl</i>

823
00:52:26,509 --> 00:52:29,577
<i>One less lonely girl</i>

824
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:32,346
<i>And Justin didn't feel like</i>
<i>it was right to sing</i>

825
00:52:32,347 --> 00:52:35,215
<i>to a girl that night 'cause he
had just shared the last time</i>

826
00:52:35,217 --> 00:52:38,786
<i>he performed</i> One Less Lonely
Girl,<i> it was her in the chair.</i>

827
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:42,523
<i>We took a bunch of pictures. We
put them into a huge montage.</i>

828
00:52:42,525 --> 00:52:44,525
<i>During</i> One Less Lonely Girl,
<i>we put them up on the screen.</i>

829
00:52:44,527 --> 00:52:45,492
<i>How many bags you packed</i>

830
00:52:45,494 --> 00:52:46,827
<i>Just to take them back?</i>

831
00:52:46,829 --> 00:52:49,362
<i>Tell me that</i>
<i>How many either or's?</i>

832
00:52:49,364 --> 00:52:53,833
<i>But no more if you let me</i>
<i>inside of your world</i>

833
00:52:53,835 --> 00:52:56,336
<i>There'll be one</i>
<i>less lonely girl...</i>

834
00:52:56,338 --> 00:52:57,972
<i>And he didn't walk to the chair.</i>

835
00:52:57,974 --> 00:53:00,875
<i>He walked to the top and he
stared and he sang to the screen.</i>

836
00:53:00,876 --> 00:53:01,876
<i>Before I saw you</i>

837
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:03,715
<i>Now all I see is you</i>

838
00:53:06,715 --> 00:53:11,818
<i>Oh, no, don't need</i>
<i>these other pretty faces</i>

839
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:13,887
<i>'Cause when you're mine,
in the world...</i>

840
00:53:13,889 --> 00:53:17,259
<i>I think that was</i>
<i>his way of saying goodbye.</i>

841
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:18,726
<i>There's gonna be
one less lonely girl</i>

842
00:53:18,728 --> 00:53:21,663
<i>One less lonely girl</i>
<i>I'm coming for you</i>

843
00:53:21,664 --> 00:53:24,264
<i>One less lonely girl</i>
<i>I'm coming for you</i>

844
00:53:24,266 --> 00:53:26,500
<i>One less lonely girl</i>

845
00:53:26,501 --> 00:53:28,601
<i>There's gonna be</i>
<i>one less lonely girl</i>

846
00:53:28,603 --> 00:53:29,570
<i>I'm coming for you</i>

847
00:53:29,572 --> 00:53:32,539
<i>I'm gonna put you first</i>

848
00:53:32,541 --> 00:53:34,010
<i>I'll show you what you're worth</i>

849
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:37,878
<i>If you let me inside</i>
<i>of your world</i>

850
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:40,780
<i>There's gonna be</i>
<i>one less lonely girl</i>

851
00:53:40,782 --> 00:53:43,550
<i>One less lonely girl</i>
<i>I'm coming for you</i>

852
00:53:43,552 --> 00:53:46,353
<i>One less lonely girl</i>
<i>I'm coming for you</i>

853
00:53:46,355 --> 00:53:48,722
<i>One less lonely girl</i>

854
00:53:48,724 --> 00:53:51,692
<i>There's gonna be</i>
<i>one less lonely girl</i>

855
00:53:51,693 --> 00:53:52,927
<i>She touched all of</i>
<i>us in her short time</i>

856
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:55,596
<i>on this planet, and, you know,
those are the things</i>

857
00:53:55,597 --> 00:53:57,498
<i>that make the job real.</i>

858
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,467
<i>We'll never forget her.</i>

859
00:54:08,878 --> 00:54:11,579
That's row four,
seat one. Hot seats.

860
00:54:13,916 --> 00:54:17,985
<i>So things have changed since the
last tour and</i> Never Say Never.

861
00:54:17,987 --> 00:54:20,487
<i>It was an amazing experience</i>
<i>and something that</i>

862
00:54:20,489 --> 00:54:22,322
we'll all be proud of
the rest of our lives,

863
00:54:22,324 --> 00:54:23,657
but now we can't go outside.

864
00:54:23,659 --> 00:54:26,661
- You guys need tickets?
- No, no, we've got tickets.

865
00:54:27,797 --> 00:54:29,996
<i>Kenny goes
outside and gets mobbed.</i>

866
00:54:29,998 --> 00:54:31,898
Kenny!

867
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:33,967
<i>Dan Kanter</i>

868
00:54:33,969 --> 00:54:36,503
<i>We wrote this song for you</i>

869
00:54:36,505 --> 00:54:38,105
<i>We hope you like it</i>

870
00:54:38,106 --> 00:54:41,106
<i>We really do</i>

871
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:43,844
<i>You know, Allison can't choose the
</i> One Less Lonely Girl <i> anymore,</i>

872
00:54:43,846 --> 00:54:45,612
<i>so when I go outside now</i>

873
00:54:45,614 --> 00:54:48,414
<i>I have to literally
disguise myself or hide</i>

874
00:54:48,416 --> 00:54:52,786
to navigate the giveback
that we do every show,

875
00:54:52,788 --> 00:54:54,088
<i>'cause we still give</i>
<i>away those tickets.</i>

876
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:55,755
Can we have a picture with you?

877
00:54:55,757 --> 00:54:57,891
Would you mind if I hug you?

878
00:54:57,893 --> 00:54:59,726
All right.
So here's my problem...

879
00:54:59,728 --> 00:55:01,628
Yeah.

880
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:04,565
- I don't have enough tickets to take care of everybody.
- Aw.

881
00:55:04,567 --> 00:55:07,067
Who's gonna stay outside out of your six?
You gotta pick one person.

882
00:55:07,068 --> 00:55:09,769
Can we have a minute
to talk about it?

883
00:55:09,771 --> 00:55:12,210
- You wanna have a minute to talk about it?
- Yeah, a minute.

884
00:55:14,543 --> 00:55:17,443
I can't do that.
I want, like, you don't...

885
00:55:17,445 --> 00:55:18,445
I can't.

886
00:55:37,099 --> 00:55:39,135
No, no,
you were like one of the...

887
00:55:40,135 --> 00:55:41,672
What? So you won't go?

888
00:55:44,672 --> 00:55:46,907
All right.

889
00:55:46,909 --> 00:55:49,108
She's gonna stay. Hug her
'cause you guys get to go in.

890
00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:50,744
No, no.

891
00:55:50,746 --> 00:55:53,083
Hey, wait, come here,
come here, come here...

892
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,010
You guys trying to buy tickets?

893
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:23,076
You have tickets?
You have any?

894
00:56:23,077 --> 00:56:25,144
- Yeah, we did.
- What happened to them?

895
00:56:25,146 --> 00:56:27,047
They're fraud?

896
00:56:27,047 --> 00:56:28,514
And they said they're
fraud at the box office?

897
00:56:28,516 --> 00:56:30,083
- Yeah.
- Are you upset?

898
00:56:30,085 --> 00:56:31,856
Yeah.

899
00:56:33,856 --> 00:56:35,559
- Oh, my God.
- Shh. Shh.

900
00:56:37,559 --> 00:56:39,860
Oh, my God.

901
00:56:39,862 --> 00:56:41,664
I can't breathe.
Oh, my God.

902
00:56:44,532 --> 00:56:45,731
I'm gonna cry.

903
00:56:45,733 --> 00:56:46,833
Guys?

904
00:56:46,835 --> 00:56:48,835
Yes.

905
00:56:57,646 --> 00:56:59,965
Girls, you have to hurry to get
to your front row tickets.

906
00:57:04,853 --> 00:57:06,420
Front row!

907
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:09,121
<i>We still go outside and make
sure kids are taken care of.</i>

908
00:57:09,123 --> 00:57:11,657
We still go up to the top
deck and upgrade people.

909
00:57:11,659 --> 00:57:13,418
And there's no better
feeling in the world.

910
00:57:15,164 --> 00:57:17,800
We just gotta be
a little sneakier about it.

911
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:19,932
You don't owe me anything.

912
00:57:19,934 --> 00:57:20,934
We're good.
We're good.

913
00:57:38,786 --> 00:57:40,721
<i>Watch the cables
and watch your fingers,</i>

914
00:57:40,722 --> 00:57:42,893
video wall coming in.

915
00:57:45,893 --> 00:57:47,414
Okay. Lock number
one set, everybody.

916
00:58:29,771 --> 00:58:32,271
<i>Being on tour,
we go to city to city to city,</i>

917
00:58:32,273 --> 00:58:35,809
<i>that schedule, it's so draining.</i>

918
00:58:35,811 --> 00:58:38,144
<i>He would just be on the bus</i>

919
00:58:38,146 --> 00:58:40,684
and he'll just be
in a stare, just like...

920
00:58:42,684 --> 00:58:44,217
And I'll just
be like, "Hey."

921
00:58:44,219 --> 00:58:47,721
<i>It's 7:00 a.m., barely slept
anything, just had a show,</i>

922
00:58:47,722 --> 00:58:50,157
<i>three shows in a row,</i>
<i>so exhausted.</i>

923
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:53,929
<i>You just wanna run in the
hotel and just go to sleep.</i>

924
00:58:57,519 --> 00:58:59,599
This go round is way more
popular than in my world.

925
00:58:59,601 --> 00:59:00,967
There's a lot more
people outside.

926
00:59:00,969 --> 00:59:03,568
There's a lot more people at the
bus, so it's hard to be normal.

927
00:59:05,273 --> 00:59:08,608
<i>We can sneak off and try to
be as normal as possible.</i>

928
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:11,014
<i>But feeling normal,
I don't think that's possible.</i>

929
00:59:12,014 --> 00:59:15,081
When he's hiding in the trunk of a
car so we can go get ice cream,

930
00:59:15,083 --> 00:59:18,117
sticking his hand out
of the trunk just to feel air

931
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:21,088
<i>so he doesn't, like,</i>
<i>go crazy of claustrophobia,</i>

932
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:23,690
<i>and we're doing all of this</i>
<i>just to sneak to go grab</i>

933
00:59:23,692 --> 00:59:25,092
<i>some ice cream.</i>

934
00:59:25,094 --> 00:59:26,655
How can that even
feel halfway normal?

935
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:35,769
He's gotta go through things with everyone
watching every step that he makes.

936
00:59:35,771 --> 00:59:37,237
Justin, do you love your fans?

937
00:59:37,239 --> 00:59:39,271
Do you love your fans, Justin?

938
00:59:39,273 --> 00:59:42,876
There's somewhat of a gift
and a curse in being popular.

939
00:59:42,878 --> 00:59:44,811
Move out of the way, man.

940
00:59:44,813 --> 00:59:46,052
You gotta move out of the way.

941
00:59:52,721 --> 00:59:53,721
What'd you say?

942
00:59:56,257 --> 00:59:59,760
I'd been chased by those
same people that whole trip,

943
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:01,722
and they were talking
nonsense the whole time,

944
01:00:02,231 --> 01:00:04,364
like verbally assaulting me.

945
01:00:06,768 --> 01:00:08,128
As a human being,
rage comes out,

946
01:00:09,003 --> 01:00:11,672
and I happened to snap,
and I opened the door

947
01:00:11,672 --> 01:00:12,706
and I was like, "What do you...

948
01:00:12,708 --> 01:00:14,708
"What are you guys..."
I really wanted to hit him.

949
01:00:17,278 --> 01:00:18,278
<i>We ended up peeling off.</i>

950
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:23,451
I learned from that.

951
01:00:23,452 --> 01:00:25,117
That's what they wanted.

952
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:27,253
They wanted to get
a reaction out of me

953
01:00:27,255 --> 01:00:28,688
<i>so that they could print that,</i>

954
01:00:28,690 --> 01:00:31,291
so that they could
make me seem like this,

955
01:00:31,293 --> 01:00:34,161
"Oh, I'm out of control."
But really I'm just...

956
01:00:34,163 --> 01:00:36,862
I have a heart
and I have feelings.

957
01:00:36,864 --> 01:00:39,465
And when people...
When people...

958
01:00:39,467 --> 01:00:42,702
...like hurt my heart,
I'm gonna get angry, upset

959
01:00:42,704 --> 01:00:44,664
and lash out sometimes
'cause I'm a human being.

960
01:00:59,353 --> 01:01:00,755
<i>Here we go.</i>

961
01:01:15,137 --> 01:01:16,219
<i>Here we go.</i>

962
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:31,219
<i>Here we go.</i>

963
01:01:38,159 --> 01:01:39,237
<i>Here we go.</i>

964
01:01:51,172 --> 01:01:52,965
<i>Here we go.</i>

965
01:02:22,103 --> 01:02:24,170
<i>Here we go.</i>

966
01:02:24,172 --> 01:02:26,907
<i>She don't like the flash</i>

967
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:29,014
<i>Wanna keep us in the dark</i>

968
01:02:32,014 --> 01:02:34,380
<i>She don't like the fame</i>

969
01:02:34,382 --> 01:02:38,083
<i>Hate it when we're miles apart</i>

970
01:02:38,085 --> 01:02:39,885
<i>Here we go.</i>

971
01:02:39,887 --> 01:02:43,824
<i>It's getting to the point</i>
<i>where it's too much for her</i>

972
01:02:43,826 --> 01:02:47,159
<i>Throw us all away</i>
<i>'cause it's too much for her</i>

973
01:02:47,161 --> 01:02:50,197
<i>She can't hide away</i>

974
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:53,099
<i>'Cause the world</i>
<i>knows who we are</i>

975
01:02:53,101 --> 01:02:55,036
<i>She don't like the lights</i>

976
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:01,141
<i>She don't, she don't, she don't</i>

977
01:03:01,143 --> 01:03:03,077
<i>She don't like the lights</i>

978
01:03:06,914 --> 01:03:09,148
<i>She don't, she don't, she don't</i>

979
01:03:09,150 --> 01:03:11,384
<i>Don't wanna share</i>
<i>with no one else</i>

980
01:03:11,385 --> 01:03:13,086
<i>Want me to herself</i>

981
01:03:13,088 --> 01:03:16,523
<i>Don't want no love</i>
<i>in front of the camera</i>

982
01:03:16,525 --> 01:03:18,126
<i>She don't like the lights</i>

983
01:03:22,396 --> 01:03:24,197
<i>She don't, she don't, she don't</i>

984
01:03:24,199 --> 01:03:25,731
<i>She don't like the lights</i>

985
01:03:25,733 --> 01:03:28,434
<i>Bieber is no stranger
to flipping off photographers,</i>

986
01:03:28,436 --> 01:03:30,471
<i>but is his behavior</i>
<i>becoming more erratic?</i>

987
01:03:30,472 --> 01:03:32,137
<i>He's out of control.</i>

988
01:03:32,139 --> 01:03:33,476
<i>She's giving ultimatums</i>

989
01:03:35,476 --> 01:03:38,447
<i>She don't like this life</i>

990
01:03:39,447 --> 01:03:43,182
<i>She said if I loved her</i>

991
01:03:43,184 --> 01:03:45,387
<i>I'd give it up,</i>
<i>won't think twice</i>

992
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:49,956
<i>I can't do that</i>

993
01:03:49,958 --> 01:03:52,199
<i>It's getting to the point</i>

994
01:03:53,195 --> 01:03:54,661

01:04:34,202 --> 01:04:35,534

1007
01:04:35,536 --> 01:04:39,706
<i>How can I choose between the two</i>

1008
01:04:39,708 --> 01:04:43,510
<i>When all the lights</i>

1009
01:04:43,512 --> 01:04:47,514
<i>I wish she could see</i>

1010
01:04:47,516 --> 01:04:51,217
<i>I hope that she waits</i>

1011
01:04:51,219 --> 01:04:55,088
<i>'Cause I don't wanna live life</i>

1012

1013

01:05:43,739 --> 01:05:45,474
<i>She don't like the lights</i>

1023
01:05:55,317 --> 01:05:57,550
People on the outside
look in at celebrities,

1024
01:05:57,552 --> 01:06:00,023
especially people like Lindsay
Lohan, Britney, almost...

1025
01:06:01,023 --> 01:06:02,355
They feel sad.

1026
01:06:02,356 --> 01:06:03,655
You look at Michael Jackson,
you feel sad

1027
01:06:03,657 --> 01:06:05,326
because they're like,
you can't...

1028
01:06:05,327 --> 01:06:06,760
- Yes.
- ...escape this.

1029
01:06:06,762 --> 01:06:10,697
It is an inevitability that a young
person will become a train wreck.

1030
01:06:10,699 --> 01:06:12,432
Do you think about that?

1031
01:06:12,434 --> 01:06:15,101
And are you conscious that you
are the perfect candidate

1032
01:06:15,103 --> 01:06:17,103
to become a train wreck?

1033
01:06:17,105 --> 01:06:18,405
You are.

1034
01:06:18,407 --> 01:06:19,539
- We talk about this all the time.
- Um.

1035
01:06:19,541 --> 01:06:21,775
What? We talk about
this all the time.

1036
01:06:21,777 --> 01:06:22,909
There's no train wreck.

1037
01:06:22,911 --> 01:06:26,246
What... I'm living here,
I'm 19, by myself in this...

1038
01:06:26,248 --> 01:06:28,581
In this great house, just...

1039
01:06:28,583 --> 01:06:29,817
But that's where
the train wreck can start.

1040
01:06:29,818 --> 01:06:31,284
- How can... How?
- 'Cause it's safe.

1041
01:06:31,286 --> 01:06:32,485
- 'Cause it's a bubble.
- But there's no...

1042
01:06:32,487 --> 01:06:34,788
No one can tell you no.
So now what?

1043
01:06:34,789 --> 01:06:36,688
Now what are you gonna do
when no one can say no?

1044
01:06:36,690 --> 01:06:38,663
No one can say no,
but here's the thing,

1045
01:06:41,663 --> 01:06:44,130
for me, I've seen it happen.

1046
01:06:44,132 --> 01:06:45,697
I can't...

1047
01:06:45,699 --> 01:06:49,335
I'm not gonna be
stupid enough to...

1048
01:06:49,335 --> 01:06:51,605
For me to let
that happen to myself

1049
01:06:51,606 --> 01:06:54,375
because I have a good
head on my shoulders.

1050
01:06:54,376 --> 01:06:57,177
Maybe I might make a few
mistakes, sure, I'm 19.

1051
01:06:57,179 --> 01:06:59,778
But I was raised, like,
Sunday school every Sunday,

1052
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:02,282
like, I was the... My mom
broke it down to me,

1053
01:07:02,284 --> 01:07:05,452
like, this is who you are,
you're gonna be a good person,

1054
01:07:05,454 --> 01:07:07,653
you're gonna help people, you're
gonna be quick to forgive,

1055
01:07:07,655 --> 01:07:10,824
you're gonna be a humble,
genuine person.

1056
01:07:10,826 --> 01:07:14,726
And if you're not, there's
gonna be consequences.

1057
01:07:14,728 --> 01:07:17,730
She doesn't agree with some
of the decisions that I make.

1058
01:07:17,731 --> 01:07:20,800
Sometimes... Well, all
moms don't agree with...

1059
01:07:20,802 --> 01:07:23,302
But she knows that I got
a good head on my shoulders.

1060
01:07:23,304 --> 01:07:25,405
She did what she
had to do to raise me.

1061
01:07:25,407 --> 01:07:26,873
And she did a wonderful,
wonderful job.

1062
01:07:26,875 --> 01:07:30,844
And I'm super,
super grateful for her.

1063
01:07:30,846 --> 01:07:34,483
You know what, I don't like your
attitude, to be quite honest.

1064
01:07:35,483 --> 01:07:36,715
You're mad.

1065
01:07:36,717 --> 01:07:39,184
Because, you know what,
you're too young

1066
01:07:39,186 --> 01:07:41,355
to be peepeeing in buckets
and driving up and down

1067
01:07:41,356 --> 01:07:43,222
the highway fast.

1068
01:07:43,224 --> 01:07:46,726
I don't think your mom would really
mind if a stranger whipped her son.

1069
01:07:46,728 --> 01:07:48,396
You ain't spanking me, man.

1070
01:07:49,396 --> 01:07:50,797
Ow! What are you doing?

1071
01:07:50,797 --> 01:07:52,202
What are you doing?

1072
01:07:55,202 --> 01:07:56,202
Whoo!

1073
01:08:02,878 --> 01:08:04,684
So who are you dating now?

1074
01:08:09,684 --> 01:08:13,733
So I'm backstage at,
um, my concert.

1075
01:08:25,734 --> 01:08:28,568
I just wanted to make this video

1076
01:08:28,569 --> 01:08:30,645
because I just saw Justin's VD.

1077
01:08:37,645 --> 01:08:41,314
You really inspire me.
I really, like...

1078
01:08:41,314 --> 01:08:44,658
You're the reason why I wake up with
a smile on my face every morning.

1079
01:08:50,658 --> 01:08:52,234
Yes, I will stay
with you forever.

1080
01:08:59,234 --> 01:09:01,335
I just love you so much, Justin,

1081
01:09:01,336 --> 01:09:03,403
and hope you're
gonna see this video

1082
01:09:03,404 --> 01:09:06,273
'cause otherwise I'm
really gonna look stupid.

1083
01:09:06,274 --> 01:09:08,408
Yeah.

1084
01:09:08,408 --> 01:09:11,344
Thank you for everything
you've done for us,

1085
01:09:11,345 --> 01:09:13,514

1088
01:09:16,716 --> 01:09:18,985
<i>is what keeps him alive I think,</i>

1089
01:09:18,987 --> 01:09:20,920
because if he gets
too far off track,

1090
01:09:20,921 --> 01:09:22,555
they're there to kinda
be that moral compass

1091
01:09:22,555 --> 01:09:23,759
that brings him back always.

1092
01:09:24,759 --> 01:09:26,894
Oh, my...
Look, how close we are.

1093
01:09:26,895 --> 01:09:28,429
Oh, my God.

1094
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:31,599
It all started... It all
stemmed off from my fans

1095
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,836
showing up at
each radio station.

1096

it's gotta end up with the fans.

that was so cute. Oh, my gosh.

01:09:49,484 --> 01:09:50,783

01:15:04,230 --> 01:15:05,898
'Cause that journey, by the way,

1173
01:15:05,899 --> 01:15:08,737
is gonna help someone
make it through their journey.

1174
01:15:09,737 --> 01:15:12,274
<i>I need some space</i>

1175
01:15:13,274 --> 01:15:15,841
<i>To come around you</i>

1176
01:15:15,841 --> 01:15:19,681
<i>Around, around,</i>
<i>around, around, around</i>

1177
01:15:21,681 --> 01:15:24,617
You know, if you're an
artist that is after fame,

1178
01:15:24,618 --> 01:15:25,953
after money,

1179
01:15:26,953 --> 01:15:29,155
and you achieve those things,

1180
01:15:29,157 --> 01:15:31,591
then you have no
reason to go forward.

1181
01:15:31,591 --> 01:15:33,859
<i>If your goals are</i>
<i>to make great music,</i>

1182
01:15:33,859 --> 01:15:36,128
to be a better
and better singer,

1183
01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:39,865
to be a better and
better writer every day,

1184
01:15:39,867 --> 01:15:41,987
then that's a lifelong journey
and that doesn't end.

1185
01:15:46,006 --> 01:15:48,646
<i>It's a weird position to be in
when you've only been winning,</i>

1186
01:15:49,010 --> 01:15:52,278
but he doesn't really understand
what the loss looks like.

1187
01:15:52,279 --> 01:15:54,613
That's why it's important for
him to just stay humble,

1188
01:15:54,614 --> 01:15:56,148
stay on that humble path,

1189
01:15:56,149 --> 01:15:59,853
because the minute
something goes wrong,

1190
01:15:59,854 --> 01:16:02,957
everybody's gonna
try to tear him apart.

1191
01:16:03,957 --> 01:16:08,094
You know, and he has to always
remember what got him there.

1192
01:16:08,095 --> 01:16:09,630
You gonna get through
the whole time this time?

1193
01:16:09,631 --> 01:16:10,631
I'll try.

1194
01:16:11,032 --> 01:16:12,032
All right. Go ahead.

1195
01:16:25,947 --> 01:16:29,315
Um, yeah.

1196
01:16:29,317 --> 01:16:32,685
If I wasn't scared
that'd be a bad thing.

1197
01:16:32,685 --> 01:16:34,153
We've had moments
over the last year

1198
01:16:34,154 --> 01:16:36,354
where it's just been
straight yelling, screaming,

1199
01:16:36,355 --> 01:16:38,824
tears, hugs.

1200
01:16:38,826 --> 01:16:40,693
I mean, we're going like this
and he'll call me and be like,

1201
01:16:40,694 --> 01:16:42,094
- "You just need to come here."
- Just come here.

1202
01:16:42,095 --> 01:16:44,363
And you need to spend time,
you need to be around me,

1203
01:16:44,363 --> 01:16:46,766
and I want you to be
around me 'cause I want...

1204
01:16:46,768 --> 01:16:49,702
I want you in my life and I want
you to see what's going on.

1205
01:16:49,703 --> 01:16:50,703
And...

1206
01:16:50,837 --> 01:16:53,706
No, but it's always
gonna be that way,

1207
01:16:53,707 --> 01:16:56,076
and honestly I'm a better man
because he's in my life

1208
01:16:56,077 --> 01:16:57,677
and because I'm going through
these struggles with him.

1209
01:16:57,679 --> 01:16:59,746
- That's so sweet...
- Thanks, man. Appreciate it.

1210
01:16:59,747 --> 01:17:01,313
That's one of the sweetest
things you've ever said.

1211
01:17:01,314 --> 01:17:03,416
But, you know, we're gonna
keep going through...

1212
01:17:03,417 --> 01:17:05,117
Hey, man. Um...

1213
01:17:05,118 --> 01:17:07,353
We're gonna keep going
through these struggles

1214
01:17:07,354 --> 01:17:08,287
and it's not
gonna get any easier,

1215
01:17:08,288 --> 01:17:10,890
but at the end of the day,
he's worth it.

1216
01:17:20,134 --> 01:17:21,467
<i>You guys seem to help.</i>

1217
01:17:21,469 --> 01:17:25,204
Believe, believe, believe.

1218
01:17:25,206 --> 01:17:28,908
It's our last show.
Time has gone by fast.

1219
01:17:28,908 --> 01:17:31,144
I remember thinking about
this day in the rehearsal.

1220
01:17:31,145 --> 01:17:32,913
I can remember the first show.

1221
01:17:33,913 --> 01:17:35,051
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

1222
01:17:37,051 --> 01:17:40,186
Just feeling that energy
that his fans just, like,

1223
01:17:40,188 --> 01:17:42,456
<i>give to us for the first time,</i>

1224
01:17:42,457 --> 01:17:46,092
<i>that realization that
I'm fulfilling my dream</i>

1225
01:17:46,094 --> 01:17:47,728
and I'll never
forget that feeling.

1226
01:17:47,729 --> 01:17:49,429
I've always dreamed
to be a choreographer.

1227
01:17:49,430 --> 01:17:51,965
Like, from the day
I started dancing

1228
01:17:51,966 --> 01:17:55,268
<i>when the first show happened,</i>
<i>I sat down against a wall</i>

1229
01:17:55,269 --> 01:17:58,204
<i>and I just, like, really</i>
<i>started crying to myself.</i>

1230
01:17:58,206 --> 01:18:00,439
Oh, my gosh, no,
how about the audition?

1231
01:18:00,439 --> 01:18:02,345
<i>Yeah, so no pressure, you know.</i>

1232
01:18:04,345 --> 01:18:06,445
<i>It was so surreal.</i>
<i>It was something</i>

1233
01:18:06,447 --> 01:18:08,180
that we had all been
working really hard towards

1234
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:10,250
and something we
had wanted so badly.

1235
01:18:10,251 --> 01:18:11,585
<i>I remember being,</i>
<i>like, 10 years old</i>

1236
01:18:11,586 --> 01:18:14,186
<i>and going to concerts and,</i>
<i>like, watching the dancer</i>

1237
01:18:14,188 --> 01:18:16,822
and I always knew
that I wanted to do this.

1238
01:18:16,823 --> 01:18:19,425
<i>I'm really, really grateful because
I got to dance with him on stage.</i>

1239
01:18:19,426 --> 01:18:22,801
It's amazing and I'm so thankful
that I got the opportunity.

1240
01:18:26,801 --> 01:18:28,969
Being right now in my home city

1241
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:31,103
where dancing
all started for me,

1242
01:18:31,104 --> 01:18:32,872
<i>seeing my mom out</i>
<i>there and, like,</i>

1243
01:18:32,872 --> 01:18:35,041
<i>thinking about how</i>
<i>much she sacrificed for me</i>

1244
01:18:35,042 --> 01:18:36,242
<i>to do what I love to do,</i>

1245
01:18:36,243 --> 01:18:38,077
<i>and I'm here with my boys</i>

1246
01:18:38,078 --> 01:18:40,479
and I'm here with one of the best
artists I've ever worked with,

1247
01:18:40,479 --> 01:18:42,984
yeah, it's amazing.
It's amazing.

1248
01:18:43,984 --> 01:18:45,385
<i>I think that believing</i>

1249
01:18:45,386 --> 01:18:47,520
<i>is the most powerful thing</i>
<i>that you can do in this life.</i>

1250
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:50,322
You can come from absolutely
nothing to something,

1251
01:18:50,323 --> 01:18:53,059
to be standing right here,
so I think that,

1252
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:55,539
I'm ready to share that with the
world just like Justin does.

1253
01:18:56,930 --> 01:19:00,065
<i>And now here we are
doing the last show.</i>

1254
01:19:00,067 --> 01:19:02,202
Oh, my gosh.
I might cry tonight.

1255
01:19:02,203 --> 01:19:03,536
- Oh, for sure.
- We might cry.

1256
01:19:03,537 --> 01:19:04,618
You might see some tears.

1257
01:19:04,970 --> 01:19:06,509
- In <i> Believe.</i>
- In <i> Believe.</i>

1258
01:19:08,509 --> 01:19:10,443
<i>The music plays until it stops.</i>

1259
01:19:10,444 --> 01:19:13,112
And when it does,
what have you learned

1260
01:19:13,113 --> 01:19:15,148
and what do you believe?

1261
01:19:15,149 --> 01:19:17,050
Do you believe this hype,

1262
01:19:17,051 --> 01:19:19,819
<i>or are you creating</i>
<i>something greater,</i>

1263
01:19:19,819 --> 01:19:22,588
<i>a deeper passion that will</i>

1264
01:19:22,590 --> 01:19:25,559
<i>not only help to articulate</i>
<i>who you are as an artist,</i>

1265
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:29,395
<i>but also help people to be</i>
<i>able to identify with you?</i>

1266
01:19:29,395 --> 01:19:31,965
<i>Believe</i> means,
like, be all you wanna be,

1267
01:19:31,966 --> 01:19:33,532
do what you wanna do and don't
stop believing in yourself,

1268
01:19:33,533 --> 01:19:34,701
just go for it.

1269
01:19:34,702 --> 01:19:37,570
I would listen to it when I
was really upset and it was,

1270
01:19:37,572 --> 01:19:39,853
like, I don't know, it's
just really helped me, like,

1271
01:19:40,006 --> 01:19:41,485
pull through and,
like, not give up.

1272
01:19:44,078 --> 01:19:46,478
<i>Justin,</i>
<i>in a lot of our car rides,</i>

1273
01:19:46,479 --> 01:19:48,215
<i>he'd be singing in the back</i>

1274
01:19:48,216 --> 01:19:49,381
and I'd be
telling him to shut up

1275
01:19:49,381 --> 01:19:51,585
because he'd never stop.

1276
01:19:51,586 --> 01:19:53,953
<i>But I didn't know this was
gonna happen obviously, right,</i>

1277
01:19:53,953 --> 01:19:56,354
<i>so this is his life,
this is what he loves,</i>

1278
01:19:56,355 --> 01:19:59,525
nothing's been
given to him and, yeah,

1279
01:19:59,527 --> 01:20:00,595
I'm very proud of him.

1280
01:20:02,595 --> 01:20:06,233
<i>I was just looking
at him the other day,</i>

1281
01:20:06,234 --> 01:20:08,902
and he had such a baby face,
and he's my baby,

1282
01:20:08,903 --> 01:20:11,103
and just to look at him now

1283
01:20:11,104 --> 01:20:13,907
<i>with, like,
his little chiseled jaw</i>

1284
01:20:13,908 --> 01:20:15,408
<i>and his attempts at facial hair.</i>

1285
01:20:17,545 --> 01:20:19,645
He's just...
He's growing so much.

1286
01:20:19,645 --> 01:20:22,882
<i>And as busy as he is</i>
<i>and as much as he has on him,</i>

1287
01:20:22,884 --> 01:20:25,985
<i>he still continues to give back.</i>

1288
01:20:25,987 --> 01:20:28,287
And, you know, as a mom and
just seeing his character grow,

1289
01:20:28,287 --> 01:20:32,958
I think that's one of the biggest,
um, achievements, in my mind.

1290
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:35,662
But, Justin, I still want you
to pull your pants up.

1291
01:20:36,182 --> 01:20:37,662
...of a night that
they can't believe.

1292
01:20:37,663 --> 01:20:40,166
I pray that you will be
with everyone on stage,

1293
01:20:40,167 --> 01:20:43,502
bless them all, help everyone
just to have the best show...

1294
01:20:43,502 --> 01:20:46,505
<i>No matter what religion,
no matter what race,</i>

1295
01:20:46,506 --> 01:20:49,011
<i>not matter what you are,
you can always believe.</i>

1296
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:51,243
It's all about positivity,

1297
01:20:51,243 --> 01:20:53,015
all about believing
in something great,

1298
01:20:54,015 --> 01:20:57,317
believing in a higher power,
believing in yourself,

1299
01:20:57,318 --> 01:21:00,452
believing that
you can do anything

1300
01:21:00,453 --> 01:21:01,533
if you set your mind to it.

1301
01:21:06,661 --> 01:21:10,033
<i>I don't know how I got here</i>

1302
01:21:12,033 --> 01:21:15,203
<i>I knew it wouldn't be easy</i>

1303
01:21:18,203 --> 01:21:22,511
<i>But your faith in me</i>
<i>was so clear</i>

1304
01:21:23,511 --> 01:21:25,411
<i>It didn't matter how many times</i>

1305
01:21:25,412 --> 01:21:29,615
<i>I got knocked on the floor</i>

1306
01:21:29,617 --> 01:21:34,657
<i>But you knew one day</i>
<i>I would be standing tall</i>

1307
01:21:36,657 --> 01:21:39,525
<i>Just look at me now</i>

1308
01:21:39,527 --> 01:21:42,628
<i>'Cause everything
starts from something</i>

1309
01:21:42,630 --> 01:21:45,597
<i>But something would be nothing</i>

1310
01:21:45,599 --> 01:21:50,470
<i>Nothing if your heart</i>
<i>didn't dream with me</i>

1311
01:21:51,470 --> 01:21:56,380
<i>Where would I be, oh</i>

1312
01:21:59,380 --> 01:22:02,282
<i>Where would I be</i>

1313
01:22:02,283 --> 01:22:06,353
<i>If you didn't believe</i>

1314
01:22:06,354 --> 01:22:07,720
<i>Would I know how it feels</i>

1315
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:10,322
<i>To touch the sky, yeah</i>

1316
01:22:10,323 --> 01:22:12,157
<i>If you didn't believe</i>

1317
01:22:12,158 --> 01:22:14,398
<i>Believe, believe</i>

1318
01:22:17,398 --> 01:22:19,398
<i>It didn't matter how many times</i>

1319
01:22:19,399 --> 01:22:22,671
<i>I got knocked on the floor</i>

1320

<i>But you knew one day</i>
<i>I would be standing tall</i>

1321
01:22:30,578 --> 01:22:32,747
<i>Look at us now</i>

1322
01:22:33,747 --> 01:22:36,548
<i>'Cause everything</i>
<i>starts from something</i>

1323
01:22:36,550 --> 01:22:40,185

01:23:25,733 --> 01:23:30,569
<i>Oh</i>

1337
01:23:30,569 --> 01:23:33,840
<i>When you've reached</i>
<i>a certain point in your life,</i>

1338
01:23:33,841 --> 01:23:38,313
<i>there are people out</i>
<i>there who sit waiting,</i>

1339
01:23:39,313 --> 01:23:41,317
<i>wanting to see you fall.</i>

1340
01:23:43,317 --> 01:23:47,286
<i>But rather than let</i>
<i>gravity take you down,</i>

1341
01:23:47,287 --> 01:23:51,626
<i>sometimes you have to take</i>
<i>matters into your own hands</i>

1342
01:23:52,626 --> 01:23:53,626
<i>and fly.</i>

1343
01:24:33,501 --> 01:24:36,668
<i>I'm Justin Bieber.
Thank you for believing in me.</i>

1344
01:24:36,670 --> 01:24:39,206
<i>'Cause I believe in you.</i>

1345
01:24:51,350 --> 01:24:52,751
This was me.

1346
01:24:52,752 --> 01:24:54,586
My pants were like this, guys.

1347
01:24:54,587 --> 01:24:55,755
- Normal, normal.
- Higher, higher.

1348
01:24:55,756 --> 01:24:57,724
And he said...
He said to me, he said,

1349
01:24:57,725 --> 01:24:59,259
"You can't let
the pants wear you,

1350
01:24:59,260 --> 01:25:00,559
"you got to
wear the pants."

1351
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:01,927
That's when I started sagging.

1352
01:25:01,929 --> 01:25:03,795
- That's true. Hey...
- And that's your fault.

1353
01:25:03,796 --> 01:25:06,398
No, listen, I will
tell you one thing though,

1354
01:25:06,399 --> 01:25:08,367
I've lost a pair of pants,
bro, walking.

1355
01:25:08,368 --> 01:25:09,668
- Yeah?
- Lost a pair of pants walking.

1356
01:25:09,670 --> 01:25:10,936
No.

1357
01:25:10,938 --> 01:25:12,371
And it's not like, you know,

1358
01:25:12,372 --> 01:25:13,773
like, you're out at a bookstore

1359
01:25:13,774 --> 01:25:15,175
just browsing
the nonfiction section.

1360
01:25:15,176 --> 01:25:16,742
- Yeah.
- The nonfiction section.

1361
01:25:16,743 --> 01:25:18,510
And your pants are
a little bit low.

1362
01:25:18,511 --> 01:25:21,180
I'm just saying that one day,
just be careful, bro,

1363
01:25:21,180 --> 01:25:22,715
because I've lost
a pair of pants.

1364
01:25:22,716 --> 01:25:23,916
- Okay. I'm just saying...
- The nonfiction section...

1365
01:25:23,917 --> 01:25:26,286
- You were the... You were the one...
- ...at Barnes & Noble.

1366
01:25:26,287 --> 01:25:27,686
You were the one that said,

1367
01:25:27,688 --> 01:25:29,822
"Hey, don't let
the pants wear you,

1368
01:25:29,823 --> 01:25:31,557
- "wear the pants."
- That's right.

1369
01:25:31,559 --> 01:25:32,858
That's why...

1370
01:25:32,859 --> 01:25:34,793
But they... Hey...

1371
01:25:34,795 --> 01:25:36,228
- Wear them though.
- Yeah, wear them.

1372
01:25:36,229 --> 01:25:37,729
When they're on the ground,
bro, they're off.

1373
01:25:37,729 --> 01:25:39,331
- Yeah, yeah.
- Nobody's wearing them.

1374
01:26:44,663 --> 01:26:45,663
Oh, no.

1375
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:55,875
Smile big!

1376
01:26:55,876 --> 01:26:56,876
One, two! Perfect, yeah.

1377
01:27:00,514 --> 01:27:01,514
Don't cry too much.

1378
01:27:10,622 --> 01:27:11,703
Told them he's gonna fall.

1379
01:27:23,037 --> 01:27:26,405
<i>When I was 13,</i>
<i>I had my first love</i>

1380
01:27:26,407 --> 01:27:27,974
<i>There was nobody</i>
<i>that compared to my baby</i>

1381
01:27:27,975 --> 01:27:30,376
<i>And nobody came between us</i>
<i>or could ever come above</i>

1382
01:27:30,377 --> 01:27:33,979
<i>She had me going crazy</i>
<i>oh, I was star struck</i>

1383
01:27:33,979 --> 01:27:37,582
<i>She woke me up daily</i>
<i>don't need no Starbucks</i>

1384
01:27:37,582 --> 01:27:39,385
<i>She made my heart pound</i>

1385
01:27:39,386 --> 01:27:40,786
<i>It skipped a beat</i>
<i>when I see her in the street</i>

1386
01:27:40,787 --> 01:27:42,148
<i>And at school on the playground</i>

1387
01:27:43,023 --> 01:27:45,390
<i>But I really wanna</i>
<i>see her on the weekend</i>

1388
01:27:45,390 --> 01:27:49,243
<i>She knows she got me dazing</i>
<i>'cause she was so amazing</i>

1389
01:27:49,243 --> 01:27:51,810
<i>And now my heart is breaking</i>
<i>but I just keep on saying...</i>

1390
01:28:04,810 --> 01:28:05,810
Hi.

1391
01:28:22,563 --> 01:28:23,912
Oh!

1392
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:40,783
Does this look like
I'm walking downstairs?

1393
01:28:43,783 --> 01:28:45,451
<i>My man, Ludacris, everybody.</i>

1394
01:28:45,452 --> 01:28:46,823
<i>Give it up for Ludacris!</i>
