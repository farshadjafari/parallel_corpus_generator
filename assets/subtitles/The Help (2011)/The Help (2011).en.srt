00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:49,939
Oh, no, Pascagoula. You couldn't have
known this, but I'm allergic to almonds.

349
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,819
Sorry, Miss Eugenia,
I'll get you another one.

350
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,527
You know, last time I had an almond,
I stopped liking men.

351
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,236
Oh, my Lord.

352
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:01,154
Oh, no, Rebecca, it's fine. There's
a special root tea for that now.

353
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,663
You have pushed it, young lady.

354
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:06,493
Daddy. What happened to Constantine?

355
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,957
Uh, well...

356
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:13,048
Constantine went to live in Chicago
with her family.

357
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:15,710
People move on, Skeeter.

358
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,254
But I do wish that she'd
stayed down here with us.

359
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:24,977
I don't believe you.

360
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:26,595
[Sighing]

361
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,185
She would've written and told me.

362
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,151
Did you fire her?

363
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:44,948
We were just a job to her, honey.
With them, it's all about money.

364
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:48,618
You'll understand that once you've
hired help of your own.

365
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,254
- She raised me.
- She did not!

366
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:55,007
She worked here for 29 years!

367
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,384
It was a colored thing
and I put it behind me!

368
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:01,927
Excuse me a moment, Rebecca. My daughter
has upset my cancerous ulcers.

369
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,846
[Door slamming]

370
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:11,232
[birds calling]

371
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:51,100
What you doing hiding out here, girl?

372
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:56,144
I couldn't tell Mama I didn't
get asked to the dance.

373
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,436
It's all right.

374
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:02,150
Some things we just got to
keep to ourselves, right?

375
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:05,076
All the boys say I'm ugly.

376
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:11,042
Mama was third runner-up in
the Miss South Carolina pageant.

377
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,875
I wish you'd quit
feeling sorry for yourself.

378
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:17,165
Now, that's ugly.

379
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:21,757
Ugly is something that
goes up inside you.

380
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,389
It's mean and hurtful, like them boys.

381
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,513
Now you're not one of them, is you?

382
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,474
I didn't think so, honey.

383
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:37,685
Every day...

384
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:42,486
Every day you're not
dead in the ground,

385
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:47,245
when you wake up in the morning, you're
gonna have to make some decisions.

386
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:51,119
Got to ask yourself this question:

387
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:53,417
"Am I gonna believe

388
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:58,251
all them bad things them fools
say about me today?"

389
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,299
You hear me?

390
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:04,587
"Am I gonna believe all them bad things

391
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,256
them fools say about me today'?"

392
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:11,260
All right?

393
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:18,276
As for your mama,
she didn't pick her life.

394
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:21,070
It picked her.

395
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:24,982
But you...

396
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:31,410
...you're gonna do
something big with yours.

397
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,124
You wait and see.

398
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:39,463
Come on, go home with me
till the dance over. Come on.

399
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:49,256
[Chuckling]

400
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,779
Miss Stein, you said in your letter
to write about what disturbs me,

401
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,234
particularly if it bothers no one else.

402
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,398
Come on.

403
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,363
And I understand that now.

404
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:10,949
Continue.

405
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:14,748
I'd like to write something
from the point of view of the help.

406
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,832
These colored women
raise white children,

407
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:22,294
and in 20 years,
those children become the boss.

408
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:25,175
We love them and they love us,

409
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:27,632
but they can't even use the toilets
in our houses.

410
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:29,388
Don't you find that ironic, Miss Stein?

411
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:30,547
I'm listening.

412
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:34,685
Margaret Mitchell glorified
the mammy figure,

413
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,516
- [sighing]
- who dedicates her whole life

414
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:37,725
to a white family.

415
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:41,267
But nobody ever asked Mammy
how she felt about it.

416
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,186
So, a side to this never before heard?

417
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:46,276
Yes.

418
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:49,282
'Cause nobody ever really
talks about it down here.

419
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:53,909
Skeeter, who are you
talking to in there?

420
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,290
Go away!

421
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:02,880
- Who was that?
- My mother.

422
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,585
Look.

423
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:08,218
No maid in her right mind is ever gonna
tell you the truth.

424
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:11,927
That's a hell of a risk to take in
a place like Jackson, Mississippi.

425
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:13,466
I already have a maid.

426
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,971
Really? A Negro maid has already agreed
to speak with you?

427
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:21,352
Yes, ma'am.

428
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:28,189
Well... I guess I can read
what you come up with.

429
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,528
The book biz could use
a little rattling.

430
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:32,068
Thank you, Miss Stein.

431
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:33,986
Hey, hey, hey, all I'm saying

432
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:37,123
is that I'll let you know
if it's even worth pursuing.

433
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:40,706
And for God's sake, you're
a 23-year-old educated woman.

434
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:43,041
Go get yourself an apartment.

435
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,047
[Skeeter] "Dear Miss Myrna:

436
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:52,676
When I'm chopping onions, how do I
keep tears out of my eyes?"

437
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:56,433
[Aibileen] Shoot, that's easy. You tell
her hold a matchstick between her teeth.

438
00:27:57,885 --> 00:27:59,432
Is it lit?

439
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:01,222
No, ma'am.

440
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:06,606
[Hilly] Miss Leefolt said
you could start right away.

441
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:11,740
Build it just like the bathroom
at my house. Let's see. [gasping]

442
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:15,529
- Right there. That will be nice.
- Yes, ma'am.

443
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,117
[Thunder rumbling]

444
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:23,377
My goodness, we got to run back
to the car. Come on.

445
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:25,288
[Hilly] Bye, Skeeter!

446
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,467
Aibileen.

447
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:34,256
There's something else I want to
write about. I would need your help.

448
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:41,520
I want to interview you about
what it's like to work as a maid.

449
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:44,978
I'd like to do a book of interviews
about working for white families.

450
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:49,528
And we could show what it's like
to work for, say, Elizabeth?

451
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:52,940
You know what Miss Leefolt do to me if
she knew I was telling stories on her?

452
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:56,235
I was thinking that we wouldn't
have to tell her.

453
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:59,280
The other maids would have
to keep it a secret, too.

454
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:00,789
Other maids?

455
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:04,619
I was hoping to get four or five.

456
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:06,332
[Wind blowing]

457
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:09,294
To show what it's really like
in Jackson.

458
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,258
[Thunder rolling]

459
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:17,298
Show what y'all get paid,
and the babies and the bathrooms.

460
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:18,681
The good and the bad.

461
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,682
[Door slamming]

462
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,219
I bought you this damn house.
I put up with your new clothes

463
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:24,935
and trips to New Orleans,
but this takes the goddamn cake.

464
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,314
[Elizabeth]
Hilly spoke to the surgeon general,

465
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:29,192
and she also said it'll add value
to our home.

466
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:32,195
I guess Mae Mobley can go to college
in that damn bathroom!

467
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:33,606
Hilly's covering the cost and said

468
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,615
you could just do William's taxes
to pay her back.

469
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,822
We don't take orders
from the Holbrooks.

470
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,614
Skeeter, how you doing?

471
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:45,075
Fine.

472
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,669
[Mae Mobley crying]

473
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:51,006
Fix me a sandwich, Aibileen.

474
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,587
Aibileen, Mae Mobley's
crying her eyes out.

475
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,426
Skeeter.

476
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,930
I'm sorry, but I think it's best
if you leave now.

477
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:07,894
Oh, sure, sure.

478
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:11,811
And this Miss Myrna thing isn't going
to work out with Aibileen.

479
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,738
I'm sorry.

480
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:20,573
[Thunder cracking]

481
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:22,238
[rain pouring]

482
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:28,874
You're making it hotter,
flapping your arms like that, Minny.

483
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,764
Look how big the waves are, Minny.

484
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:42,174
[Wind howling]

485
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:45,595
Let's go to the beach.
Run, get Mr. Walters!

486
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:47,479
He loves riding these waves!

487
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,935
You know we went to Biloxi
on our honeymoon?

488
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,566
Yes, ma'am.

489
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:55,400
Are we in Biloxi, Minny?

490
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:59,567
No, ma'am. We ain't.

491
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:06,915
Why don't you sit down here for a spell.

492
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:12,872
And then me and you will go on down
to the beach in a little while.

493
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:14,381
How about that?

494
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,805
[Rattling]

495
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,265
Uh...

496
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:30,180
Miss Hilly?

497
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:31,940
Mm-hm?

498
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:35,773
Never mind.

499
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:38,815
You go on ahead and use
the inside bath, Minny, it's all right.

500
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,904
Oh, for crying out loud,
it's just a little rain.

501
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:45,617
She can go on up and get an umbrella
from William's study.

502
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:50,034
I believe she was working for me
before you dragged us both here.

503
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,462
[Scoffing]

504
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,793
Daddy ruined you.

505
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:01,128
I'm just gonna get your tea.

506
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,039
[Door handle rattling]

507
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:31,332
[Hilly] Minny?

508
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:34,374
Minny, are you in there?

509
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:37,756
Yes, ma'am.

510
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:40,835
And just what are you doing?

511
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:45,968
[Flushing]

512
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,390
[shouting] Get off my toilet!

513
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:52,680
[Pounding on door]

514
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,440
[exclaiming angrily]

515
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:58,193
You are fired, Minny Jackson!

516
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,740
Go on!

517
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,923
[Aibileen] Eighteen people
died in Jackson that day.

518
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:27,180
Ten white and eight black.

519
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:31,101
- [Aibileen murmuring]

I'd really like
to interview you, Aibileen.

560

yelled at you in front of Mae Mobley?

I can get my point across
a lot better writing them down.

I write an hour,
sometimes two, every night.

667
00:44:26,873 --> 00:44:31,549
And after my prayers last night,
I got some stories down, too.

Alton used to always be asking me
how come I was black.

Just ate him up.

I drank too much coffee. [chortling]

00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:52,564
OK.

694
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:54,820
[Door opens, closes]

695
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:56,105
Go on.

696
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:02,487
Well, now we're... [clears throat]

697
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:05,372
...faced with having to choose

698
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:08,159
which son can go if we don't
come up with the money.

699
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:11,996
Would you consider giving us a loan?

700
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:17,969
I'd work every day for free
till it was paid off.

701
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:22,132
That's not working for free.
That's paying off a debt.

702
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:26,135
Yes, ma'am.

703
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:34,311
As a Christian, I'm doing you a favor.

704
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:40,283
See, God don't give charity to those
who are well and able.

705
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:45,242
You need to come up with this money
on your own. OK?

706
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:49,496
Yes, ma'am.

707
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:51,126
You'll thank me one day.

708
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:57,007
[Minny] You cooking white food,
you taste it with a different spoon.

709
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:59,878
If they see you put the tasting spoon
back in the pot,

710
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:01,387
might as well throw it all out.

711
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:02,717
Spoon, too.

712
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,100
And you use the same cup, same fork,
same plate every day.

713
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:07,851
And you put it up in the cabinet.

714
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,729
You tell that white woman that's where
you're gonna keep it from now on out.

715
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,686
Don't do it and see what happens.

716
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,521
Morning, ladies.

717
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:16,356
When you're sewing white folks coffee,

718
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:17,816
set it down in front of them.

719
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:20,652
Don't hand it to them,
'cause your hands can't touch.

720
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,159
And don't hit on they children.

721
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:26,867
White folks like to do
they own spanking.

722
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:30,658
And last thing. Come here.

723
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:33,168
Look at me.

724
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:35,671
No Sass-mouthing.

725
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:40,168
No Sass-mouthing.

726
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,052
I mean it.

727
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:48,601
Give your mama a kiss.

728
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:55,768
[Aibileen] Leroy had made Sugar quit
school to help him with the bills.

729
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:03,070
And every day Minny
went without a job,

730
00:49:03,232 --> 00:49:05,985
might have been a day Leroy
took her from our world.

731
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:12,200
Good morning, everybody.

732
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:20,378
But I knew.

733
00:49:20,541 --> 00:49:24,842
I knew the only white lady Miss Hilly
hadn't gotten to with her lies.

734
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,938
[Excitedly] Hey!

735
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:38,146
[Giggling] Come on!

736
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:42,780
No sass-mouthing, Minny Jackson.
No Sass-mouthing.

737
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:47,318
Aibileen said you'd be on time.

738
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:53,449
I'm Celia Rae Foote.

739
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:55,289
I'm Minny Jackson.

740
00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:59,960
You, uh... cooking something?

741
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:04,590
One of those upside-down cakes
from a magazine.

742
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:08,507
It ain't working out too good.
Come on, let's get you a cold Coca-Cola.

743
00:50:11,217 --> 00:50:12,218
Come on.

744
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:16,393
This here is the kitchen.

745
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,938
What in the hell?

746
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:25,735
I guess I got some learning to do.

747
00:50:26,482 --> 00:50:29,531
[Scoffs] You sure do.

748
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:32,742
Johnny's grandmama left him this house
when she died.

749
00:50:32,905 --> 00:50:35,909
And then Johnny's mama
wouldn't let me change a thing.

750
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:38,077
But if I had it my way,

751
00:50:38,244 --> 00:50:43,125
this place would be wall-to-wall
white carpet with gold trim.

752
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:45,463
None of this old stuff.

753
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:47,924
The main house has
five beds and baths,

754
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:52,388
and then the pool house has
two more beds and baths.

755
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,723
When y'all gonna start
having some children,

756
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,979
filling up all these empty beds?

757
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:01,767
- I'm pregnant now.
- Oh.

758
00:51:01,934 --> 00:51:05,438
Gonna be eating for two.
That's double the cooking.

759
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,359
I know. It's an awful lotto do.

760
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:13,496
Five other maids have
already turned me down.

761
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:17,116
Let me at least get you some bus money.

762
00:51:17,283 --> 00:51:20,708
Now, uh... when did you hear me say
I don't want to clean this house?

763
00:51:21,954 --> 00:51:25,208
Wait. So you'll do it?

764
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:29,215
[Shrieks]

765
00:51:29,378 --> 00:51:30,925
[laughing happily]

766
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,473
Ooh. No hugging. No hugging.

767
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:38,979
I'm sorry. This is the first time
I've hired a maid.

768
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:41,435
Come on.

769
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,818
[Laughing, giggling]

770
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:51,158
- You hungry?
- No, ma'am. Hold on a minute.

771
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:53,365
We gots to talk about
some things first.

772
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:57,406
Oh.

773
00:51:57,573 --> 00:51:59,200
I work Sunday through Friday.

774
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:02,370
No, you can't work at all
on the weekends.

775
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:05,915
OK. What time you want me here?

776
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:10,928
After 9:00, and you gotta leave
before 4:00.

777
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:13,259
OK.

778
00:52:13,422 --> 00:52:15,140
Now...

779
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:16,892
What your husband say you can pay?

780
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,646
Johnny doesn't know
I'm bringing in help.

781
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,898
And what Mr. Johnny gonna do
when he come home

782
00:52:23,057 --> 00:52:25,230
and find a colored woman in his house?

783
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:28,191
It's not like I'd be fibbing.

784
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:30,777
I just want him to think I can do this
on my own.

785
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:35,236
I really need a maid.

786
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:39,615
I'll be here tomorrow morning
about 9:15.

787
00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:41,580
[Chuckling]

788
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:42,868
Great.

789
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,549
- Miss Celia?
- Hmm?

790
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:51,001
I think you done burned up your cake.

791
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:55,431
Doggone it!

792
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:58,593
[Running]

793
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:03,848
[Hilly] OK, let's see.
What's first up on the agenda?

794
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:10,150
We are running behind on our coat drive.
Hurry up and clean out those closets.

795
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:15,364
But our Christmas benefit, however,
is right on schedule. Mary Beth?

796
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:21,290
Well, thanks to y'all, I can announce
that we already filled

797
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:24,497
every raffle slot for baked goods!

798
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:26,253
[All cheering]

799
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:30,416
[Hilly] Think we can put a dent in
African children's hunger this year?

800
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,594
A big dent!

801
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,881
Now...

802
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,676
...I just found out
the surgeon general

803
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:44,222
has reviewed the Home Health
Sanitation Initiative that I drafted,

804
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:48,393
and he passed it along
to Governor Barnett!

805
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:52,568
Skeeter, when can we expect to see
the initiative in the newsletter?

806
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,403
I gave it to you a month ago.

807
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:56,488
I gave that to you myself.

808
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:59,620
Would you please stand, Skeeter?

809
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:06,414
I'll have it in there real soon.

810
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:10,665
Great.

811
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:12,674
[Up-tempo music]

812
00:54:19,006 --> 00:54:21,384
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hey.

813
00:54:29,308 --> 00:54:30,309
Thanks.

814
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:38,575
Hilly, I really am sorry
about the newsletter.

815
00:54:38,734 --> 00:54:41,032
It's just with Mama being sick and all.

816
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:44,706
Oh, it's fine.

817
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:49,419
I made you the egg and olive on rye,
Miss Skeeter.

818
00:54:49,578 --> 00:54:51,956
Oh, thank you, Henry.

819
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,624
You remembered.

820
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:55,134
You're welcome.

821
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:59,630
Oh, Hilly, tell her.
I can hardly stand it.

822
00:55:00,506 --> 00:55:03,100
He's coming.

823
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:06,683
Oh, Skeeter, Stuart's definitely
coming this time. Next Saturday week.

824
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:11,601
Well, he's canceled twice before.
Don't you think maybe that's a sign?

825
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:14,111
Don't you dare say that.

826
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:16,021
You know I'm not gonna be his type.

827
00:55:16,188 --> 00:55:18,407
Damn it, Skeeter, I'm not gonna
let you miss out on this

828
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:21,785
because your mother convinced you you're
not good enough for somebody like him.

829
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:27,666
Saturday night.

830
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:08,495
Good morning.

831
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:11,581
Good morning, Baby Girl.

832
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:14,041
Good morning.

833
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:28,806
I reckon I'm ready to talk about
Miss Leefolt now.

834
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:35,063
Baby Girl still gotta wear a diaper
when she sleep at night.

835
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:37,478
And it don't get changed till
I get there in the morning.

836
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:40,488
That about ten hours
she gotta sleep in her mess.

837
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:44,409
Now Miss Leefolt pregnant
with her second baby.

838
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:48,580
Lord... I pray this child
turn out good.

839
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:52,288
It's a lonely road if a mama
don't think their child is pretty.

840
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:57,088
That's very true.

841
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:02,927
Miss Leefolt should not
be having babies.

842
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:08,508
Write that down.

843
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:18,315
Treelore would like me doing this.

844
00:57:18,477 --> 00:57:21,276
He always said we were gonna have
a writer in the family one day.

845
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,861
I always thought it was gonna be him.
Maybe it's gonna be me.

846
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:26,910
[Minny] Aibileen, Aibileen.

847
00:57:27,069 --> 00:57:29,868
They done set a bomb off
in Medgar Evers' carport.

848
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:42,172
Yule Mae told me what y'all was up to.
I didn't want to believe it.

849
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:48,011
And just what makes you think
colored people need your help?

850
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:50,725
- Why do you care?
- Minny.

851
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,682
Maybe you just want
to get Aibileen in trouble.

852
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:54,437
No.

853
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:56,974
I want to show her perspective.

854
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:00,815
So people might understand
what it's like from your side.

855
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:03,652
Well, it's a real Fourth of July picnic.

856
00:58:04,231 --> 00:58:07,485
It's what we dream of doing
all weekend long.

857
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:10,404
Get back into they house,
polish the silver.

858
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:15,167
And we just love not making minimum wage
or getting Social Security.

859
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:20,043
And how we love they children
when they little.

860
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:24,001
And then they turn out
just like they mamas.

861
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,214
I know.

862
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:28,756
Maybe things can change.

863
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:31,016
What law's gonna say you
gotta be nice to your maid?

864
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:32,721
You don't have to do this now, Minny.

865
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:34,511
You damn right I don't!

866
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,393
You two give me the heart palpitations.

867
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:41,185
[Door slamming]

868
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:42,985
And that's a good mood.

869
00:58:43,145 --> 00:58:44,488
[Sighing]

870
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:47,149
[man chattering indistinctly]

871
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:57,538
All right. I'm gonna do it.

872
00:58:57,701 --> 00:59:01,672
But I need to make sure she understands
this ain't no game we playing here.

873
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:06,335
Slide your chair out from under
that table. Face me.

874
00:59:09,129 --> 00:59:12,884
I need to see you square on
at all times.

875
00:59:22,601 --> 00:59:24,194
I gotta come up with
your questions, too?

876
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:25,444
Oh.

877
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:31,034
Uh, let's begin
with where you were born.

878
00:59:31,193 --> 00:59:34,948
Belzoni, Mississippi,
on my great-auntie's sofa.

879
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:36,239
Next.

880
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:38,750
- I put the green beans in first.
- OK.

881
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:42,038
Then I get on the pork chops so I can
get started on that cornbread.

882
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:45,708
[Aibileen] Once Minny got to talking
about food, she liked to never stop.

883
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:51,180
And when she got to talking about
the white ladies, it took all night.

884
00:59:51,338 --> 00:59:55,844
Then she say, "Oh, Minny,
I'm gonna give you a paid vacation."

885
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:58,558
I ain't never had no paid vacation
in my life.

886
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,314
A week later I come back,
and they done moved to Mobile.

887
01:00:01,473 --> 01:00:02,520
[Laughing]

888
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:05,902
Miss Lazy Fingers scared I'd find
a new job before she moved.

889
01:00:06,061 --> 01:00:08,109
Ain't that right, Aibileen?

890
01:00:13,819 --> 01:00:15,446
We gots to get some more maids.

891
01:00:16,488 --> 01:00:18,957
It hard. You go try and see.

892
01:00:21,243 --> 01:00:22,745
OK, I will.

893
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:30,586
We gone and done it now.

894
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:32,629
[Laughing]

895
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:38,348
Skeeter! Get down here! Something just
arrived from New York for you.

896
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:47,561
[Shrieking]

897
01:00:53,942 --> 01:00:54,943
What is that?

898
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:58,785
The Shinalator.
All the way from New York City.

899
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:02,493
I'm a good mother.
Come on. Sit down.

900
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:09,299
The whole system cost 11 dollars.
Even smells expensive.

901
01:01:10,959 --> 01:01:14,384
You're gonna look beautiful
on your date tonight.

902
01:01:14,546 --> 01:01:16,890
I can feel the hope in your fingers.

903
01:01:19,885 --> 01:01:21,887
Holy shit.

904
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:24,647
- You shrunk five inches.
- Oh, my God.

905
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:26,854
You'll be able to wear heels tonight.

906
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:31,029
You're not leaving the house in those
awful Mexican man shoes.

907
01:01:31,188 --> 01:01:32,280
Can I take the Cadillac?

908
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:34,862
We promised the Cadillac
to Carlton and Rebecca tonight,

909
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:38,154
so William's cousin will just
have to come pick you up himself.

910
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:40,914
- I'll take the truck.
- It's hooked up to the motor grader.

911
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:42,073
I'll drive slow.

912
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,993
[Mother] Skeeter! Skeeter!

913
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:50,007
Now remember, no gentleman wants
to spend the evening with a sourpuss.

914
01:01:50,165 --> 01:01:53,419
Don't mope! Smile!

915
01:01:53,585 --> 01:01:58,933
And for heaven's sakes, don't sit like
some squaw Indian! Cross your ankles!

916
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:01,601
I love you!

917
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:12,654
Stuart, she'll be here any minute.

918
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:15,486
Hey.-

919
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:19,160
Skeeter.

920
01:02:21,488 --> 01:02:25,538
Boys, we'll be right back. Y'all talk
about quarterbacks or something.

921
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,498
Yule Mae, get Miss Skeeter a Coca-Cola.

922
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:28,833
Yes, ma'am.

923
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:34,589
[Swing music]

924
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:41,424
[whistling]

925
01:02:43,051 --> 01:02:44,052
Want a drink?

926
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:46,017
Just water, please.

927
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:51,443
[Sighing] Double Old Kentucky, straight
with a water back. Make that two backs.

928
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:54,480
You sure you don't want to just make it
the whole bottle and a straw?

929
01:02:55,272 --> 01:02:57,946
Honey, there's the lieutenant governor.
Let's go say hi.

930
01:03:02,404 --> 01:03:04,907
Good to see you, sir.
You remember my wife?

931
01:03:05,073 --> 01:03:06,290
Hi, how are you? Good to see you.

932
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:08,122
[Burping]

933
01:03:11,371 --> 01:03:14,671
So, what do you do with your time?

934
01:03:15,834 --> 01:03:16,881
You work?

935
01:03:17,669 --> 01:03:19,091
I write.

936
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:22,633
But right now I'm working on
a domestic maintenance column

937
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:23,891
for The Jackson Journal.

938
01:03:26,011 --> 01:03:27,183
You mean housekeeping.

939
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:31,896
Jesus, I can't think of anything worse
than reading a cleaning column,

940
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:33,901
except for maybe writing one.

941
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,607
Well, I can.

942
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:39,866
Working with a bunch of greasy,
stinky men in the middle of the ocean.

943
01:03:40,025 --> 01:03:43,529
It sounds like a ploy to find a husband,
becoming an expert in keeping house.

944
01:03:43,695 --> 01:03:47,325
Well, aren't you a genius?
You figured out my whole scheme.

945
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:50,710
Isn't that what all you girls
from Ole Miss major in...

946
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:52,587
...professional husband hunting?

947
01:03:52,746 --> 01:03:55,670
Who is hungry?

948
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:59,427
I'm sorry, but were you dropped
on your head as an infant?

949
01:03:59,586 --> 01:04:01,179
Or were you just born stupid?

950
01:04:01,338 --> 01:04:02,590
[Coughing]

951
01:04:12,724 --> 01:04:14,601
[squawking]

952
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:21,070
[chopping]

953
01:04:23,026 --> 01:04:25,074
So, what can you cook?

954
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:29,663
Oh, um, I can cook cornpone.

955
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:32,327
Boil potatoes.

956
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:34,462
I can do grits.

957
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:36,669
[Laughing]

958
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:39,046
Well...

959
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:43,884
...I reckon if there's anything you
ought to know about cooking, it's this.

960
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:47,142
The most important invention since
they put mayonnaise in a jar.

961
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:51,270
- You got gum in your hair,
- [sizzling]

962
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:53,648
you got a squeaky door hinge...

963
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:54,808
Crisco.

964
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,186
How pretty.

965
01:05:00,105 --> 01:05:02,028
Looks like frosting.

966
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:05,069
You got bags under your eyes.

967
01:05:05,235 --> 01:05:07,203
Want to soften your husband's
scaly feet.

968
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:09,948
Mm-hm. Crisco.

969
01:05:11,366 --> 01:05:14,415
But it's best for frying chicken.

970
01:05:15,662 --> 01:05:17,335
Frying chicken just...

971
01:05:18,498 --> 01:05:20,592
...tend to make you
feel better about life.

972
01:05:24,129 --> 01:05:25,551
At least me, anyway.

973
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:29,597
Mm, I love me some fried chicken.

974
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:32,269
Now...

975
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:35,306
...shake that.

976
01:05:35,473 --> 01:05:36,975
Oh.

977
01:05:41,813 --> 01:05:44,657
This is so much fun!

978
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:49,537
All right, all right.
The chicken already dead, Miss Celia.

979
01:05:49,737 --> 01:05:52,411
[giggling]

980
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:54,660
Yep. He dead.

981
01:06:00,748 --> 01:06:02,250
[Sighing]

982
01:06:05,837 --> 01:06:07,180
[Celia] There you are.

983
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:13,387
I'm starved. Looks so good.

984
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:15,646
We done been over this, Miss Celia.

985
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:19,685
You supposed to eat in the dining room.
That's how it works.

986
01:06:19,851 --> 01:06:21,023
Let me take your plate back.

987
01:06:21,686 --> 01:06:23,780
I'm fine right here, Minny.

988
01:06:35,617 --> 01:06:37,415
[sighing]

989
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:44,292
What?

990
01:06:45,752 --> 01:06:47,971
I just want you to know
I'm real grateful you're here.

991
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:50,882
You gots plenty more
to be grateful for than me.

992
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:55,645
And look, now I ain't
messing around no more.

993
01:06:55,803 --> 01:06:57,100
Now Mr. Johnny gonna catch me here,

994
01:06:57,263 --> 01:07:00,107
and shoot me dead right here
on this no-wax floor.

995
01:07:01,184 --> 01:07:02,231
You gots to tell him.

996
01:07:02,393 --> 01:07:05,237
Ain't he wondering how
the cooking's so good?

997
01:07:05,396 --> 01:07:07,023
You're right.

998
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:10,860
Maybe we ought to
burn the chicken a little.

999
01:07:12,946 --> 01:07:14,619
Minny don't burn chicken.

1000
01:07:17,325 --> 01:07:20,955
I like this Sarah Ross. She testifies
without complaining too much.

1001
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:24,750
And that Bertha,
she's got chutzpah, I'll give her that.

1002
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:26,259
So you liked it?

1003
01:07:26,417 --> 01:07:29,045
Eugenia, Martin Luther King
just invited

1004
01:07:29,212 --> 01:07:32,182
the entire country to march with him
in D.C. in August.

1005
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:33,683
This many Negroes and whites

1006
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:36,219
have not worked together since
Gone with the Wind.

1007
01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:39,139
How many stories have you
recorded thus far?

1008
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:41,307
The ones you've read.

1009
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:43,317
Two domestics, that's all?

1010
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:44,728
[Scoffing]

1011
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:47,485
[Skeeter] I'm real close to
getting more interviews.

1012
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:51,652
Don't send me anything else
until you do have more maids.

1013
01:07:51,818 --> 01:07:54,662
Yes, ma'am. How... how many more?

1014
01:07:54,821 --> 01:07:57,700
I don't know. At least a dozen.

1015
01:07:57,865 --> 01:08:01,210
My advice to you is to write it
and write it fast

1016
01:08:01,369 --> 01:08:03,713
before this whole civil rights thing
blows over.

1017
01:08:03,871 --> 01:08:05,544
Now good night to you, Miss Phelan.

1018
01:08:18,011 --> 01:08:20,059
We need a dozen more.

1019
01:08:20,888 --> 01:08:25,143
Me and Aibileen done asked everybody
we know. Thirty-one maids.

1020
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:28,108
They all too scared. Think we crazy.

1021
01:08:29,981 --> 01:08:32,109
If we don't get more,
we're not getting published.

1022
01:08:32,275 --> 01:08:35,245
[Minny] I gots plenty stories,
Miss Skeeter.

1023
01:08:35,403 --> 01:08:38,998
Just write them down
and invent the maid that said it.

1024
01:08:39,157 --> 01:08:41,706
You're already making up names.
Just make up the maids, too.

1025
01:08:41,868 --> 01:08:45,793
We're not gonna do that.
That would be wrong.

1026
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:47,298
Don't give up on this, Miss Skeeter.

1027
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:49,084
It wouldn't be real.

1028
01:08:50,627 --> 01:08:52,174
They Killed my son.

1029
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:02,222
He fell carrying two-by-fours
at the mill.

1030
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:05,979
Truck run over him, crushed his lung.

1031
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:07,735
[Whispering] Aibileen.

1032
01:09:11,064 --> 01:09:13,817
That white foreman threw his body
on back of a truck.

1033
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:17,488
Drove to the colored hospital...

1034
01:09:17,654 --> 01:09:19,622
...dumped him there and honked the horn.

1035
01:09:30,083 --> 01:09:34,304
There was nothing they could do,
so I brought my baby home.

[Voice breaking]
Laid him down on that sofa right there.

1037
01:09:44,931 --> 01:09:46,933
He died right in front of me.

1038
01:09:49,519 --> 01:09:53,149
He was just 24 years old, Miss Skeeter.
Best part of a person's life.

1039
01:09:54,774 --> 01:09:58,369
Anniversary of his death comes...

1040
01:09:58,528 --> 01:10:00,906
...every year, and I can't breathe.

1041
01:10:01,072 --> 01:10:03,291
But to y'all, it's just
another day of bridge.

1042
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:09,213
You stop this...

1043
01:10:10,498 --> 01:10:14,298
...everything I wrote, he wrote,
everything he was is gonna die with him.

1044

[Hilly] I am just honored
to be hosting Elizabeth's shower.

1045
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:30,109
Doesn't she look glowing, everybody?

- [Clapping]
- Yes, she does!

1047
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:35,318

to the bitter end.

[Women laughing]

1049
01:10:36,983 --> 01:10:39,031
- I'll try.
- Well, congratulations.

1050
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:43,164
I'm hungry, Mommy.

1051
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:44,494
She's always hungry.

1053
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:49,086
You know she can hear you, Elizabeth.

1054
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:53,500
[Aibileen] I'll cut you
a piece of cake, baby. Go on, now.

1055
01:10:57,545 --> 01:11:02,392
Aibileen, are you enjoying your new
bathroom over at Elizabeth's'?

1056
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:06,305
Nice to have your own.
Isn't it, Aibileen?

1057
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:14,150
Yes, ma'am. And I thank you.

1058
01:11:14,312 --> 01:11:16,986
Separate, but equal.

1059
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:20,113
That's what Ross Barnett says,
and you can't argue with the governor.

1060
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:24,497
Well, certainly not in Mississippi,
the birthplace of modern-day government.

1061
01:11:40,838 --> 01:11:44,263
Hey, Miss Skeeter.
Can I get you something?

1062
01:11:44,425 --> 01:11:45,426
No, thanks.

1063
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:49,097
Yule Mae, I wanted to talk to you
about something.

1064
01:11:51,682 --> 01:11:53,855
I already know what you're gonna ask,
Miss Skeeter.

1065
01:11:56,479 --> 01:11:58,231
Minny and Aibileen already did.

1066
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:05,996
I'm trying to get my boys
off to college.

1067
01:12:07,865 --> 01:12:10,869
It's worthwhile what
y'all are doing, but...

1068
01:12:11,035 --> 01:12:13,629
...but my boys are worth more.

1069
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:15,460
I understand.

1070
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:22,805
What do you understand, Skeeter?

1071
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:29,555
Yule Mae was just saying how excited she
is that her boys are going to college.

1072
01:12:30,388 --> 01:12:33,062
Did you also ask Miss Skeeter
if you could borrow money?

1073
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:35,234
Of course not.

1074
01:12:37,395 --> 01:12:39,397
I'm gonna put Billy down for his nap.

1075
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:42,779
Excuse me.

1076
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:47,163
Come on, baby.

[Clearing throat]

1078
01:12:54,829 --> 01:12:59,585
Skeeter, are you intentionally not
putting my initiative in the newsletter?

1079
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:03,550
No, not at all. I just have been
really busy with Mama.

1080
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:05,556
I know.

1081
01:13:05,715 --> 01:13:09,345
I know, you must be so worried
about your mother, but...

1082
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,267
I'm worried about you.

1083
01:13:13,306 --> 01:13:14,899
Reading this stuff?

1084
01:13:15,766 --> 01:13:19,691
Believe it or not, there are real
racists in this town.

1085
01:13:20,438 --> 01:13:22,611
If the wrong person caught you
with anything like that,

1086
01:13:22,773 --> 01:13:24,775
you'd be in serious trouble.

1087
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:28,325
I'll be on the lookout.

1088
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:34,535

- No! What?
- We've got to get dressed.

Don't panic. Don't panic.

1095
01:14:39,183 --> 01:14:44,064
There's a particularly tall and very
handsome man named Stuart here for you.

Oh, God.

1097
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:49,151
Oh, mother.

1098
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:51,867
You would not like him. Trust me.

1099
01:14:52,029 --> 01:14:53,281
He's a drunken asshole.

1100
01:14:53,447 --> 01:14:57,668
Love and hate are two horns on the same
goat, Eugenia, and you need a goat.

for the way I acted.

I was rude, and I've been
thinking about it a lot.

- Well, I haven't. So you can just go.
- Goddamn it!

any date. Wasn't even close to ready.

I'm sure she did.

It's not like that.
I'm not always a jerk.

1114

dated anyone before.

exactly what she's thinking.

have dinner with me?

listen to you this time.

1205
01:21:20,667 --> 01:21:22,635
- Where you headed?
- [man] Woodrow Wilson.

1206
01:21:22,795 --> 01:21:24,763
[Driver] Woodrow Wilson. All right.

1207
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:37,689
- You gonna be all right, Miss Clark?
- I'll be all right. You go on now.

1208
01:21:37,851 --> 01:21:40,104
- You want me to walk you?
- No, thank you. I'll be all right.

1209
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:41,271
[People chattering]

1210
01:21:41,438 --> 01:21:42,781
You have a good night.

1211
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,158
Which way you going?

1212
01:21:53,158 --> 01:21:56,128
[Man] We View this as a cold,

1213
01:21:56,286 --> 01:21:58,254
- brutal, deliberate...
- [sirens wailing]

1214
01:21:59,415 --> 01:22:03,670
...killing in a savage,
uncivilized state.

1215
01:22:03,836 --> 01:22:09,013
There is no state with a record that
approaches that of Mississippi

1216
01:22:09,174 --> 01:22:13,350
in inhumanity murder, brutality

1217
01:22:13,512 --> 01:22:15,560
- and racial hatred.
- [man shouting indistinctly]

1218
01:22:15,722 --> 01:22:19,397
It is absolutely at the bottom
of the list.

1219
01:22:20,894 --> 01:22:22,020
[Man 2] Fifteen minutes past midnight,

1220
01:22:22,187 --> 01:22:25,942
Evers got out of his car beside his home
in a Negro residential area.

1221
01:22:26,108 --> 01:22:28,031
In a vacant lot about 40 yards away

1222
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:31,618
a sniper fired a single shot from a
high-powered rifle at Evers' silhouette.

1223
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:34,124
I'm all right. Sit down. You all right?

1224
01:22:34,283 --> 01:22:35,876
- I'm OK.
- The bullet hit him in the back,

1225
01:22:36,034 --> 01:22:38,913
crashed through his body
through a window, into the house.

1226
01:22:39,079 --> 01:22:41,548
He died within an hour
at a Jackson hospital.

1227
01:22:41,707 --> 01:22:44,051
City detectives believe the fatal shot
was fired from...

1228
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:48,214
KKK shot him. An hour ago.

1229
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:51,933
Right in front of his children,
Aibileen.

1230
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:56,559
We're gonna pray for the Evers.
We're gonna pray for Myrlie.

1231
01:22:56,722 --> 01:23:00,067
We living in hell. Trapped.

1232
01:23:01,018 --> 01:23:02,440
Our kids, trapped.

1233
01:23:02,603 --> 01:23:04,355
[Coughing]

1234
01:23:05,898 --> 01:23:08,401
Sugar, take your brothers and sisters
and y'all go on to bed.

1235
01:23:13,864 --> 01:23:15,707
Good night.

1236
01:23:15,866 --> 01:23:18,210
Good night. Good night.

1237
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:20,417
[Coughing]

1238
01:23:20,579 --> 01:23:22,752
Oh. Good night, baby.

1239
01:23:34,343 --> 01:23:36,471
What they gonna do if they catch us
with Miss Skeeter?

1240
01:23:37,471 --> 01:23:38,848
We're gonna be careful.

1241
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:44,862
Hitch us to a pickup? Drag us behind?
Shoot me in front of my children?

1242
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:47,523
We ain't doing civil rights.

1243
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:50,613
We're just telling stories
like they really happened.

1244
01:23:52,486 --> 01:23:54,830
- You're a fool, old woman.
- [chuckling]

1245
01:23:56,031 --> 01:23:57,453
A fool.

1246
01:23:58,825 --> 01:24:01,328
[Both laughing]

1247
01:24:23,642 --> 01:24:24,643
[door opening]

1248
01:24:24,810 --> 01:24:26,278
[phones ringing]

1249
01:24:28,021 --> 01:24:32,993
Miss Phelan, the presses are heating up.
We needed Miss Myrna 30 minutes ago.

1250
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:34,611
Yes, Sir.

1251
01:24:34,778 --> 01:24:36,325
Chop-chop.

1252
01:24:37,614 --> 01:24:38,991
Good Lord.

1253
01:24:39,157 --> 01:24:41,000
[Vacuum running]

1254
01:24:49,501 --> 01:24:51,003
[thudding upstairs]

1255
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:56,675
[Minny] Miss Celia?

1256
01:25:14,443 --> 01:25:15,490
Miss Celia?

1257
01:25:15,652 --> 01:25:17,654
[Celia] Go home.
I'll see you tomorrow.

1258
01:25:17,821 --> 01:25:20,074
You mess up your hair coloring again?

1259
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:23,710
I helped you ix it last time.
We got it back to butter batch.

1260
01:25:23,869 --> 01:25:25,462
Was real pretty, remember?

1261
01:25:29,499 --> 01:25:30,842
Miss Celia.

1262
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:33,803
[Celia] I told you, go home!

1263
01:25:46,558 --> 01:25:48,105
[Loud thudding]

1264
01:25:49,770 --> 01:25:51,317
[shouting] I said get out!

1265
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:53,073
[Rattling]

1266
01:25:57,277 --> 01:25:58,995
[sobbing]

1267
01:26:07,204 --> 01:26:09,753
Why is there so much blood?

1268
01:26:11,124 --> 01:26:13,877
[Breathing heavily]

1269
01:26:15,337 --> 01:26:19,262
Next one's gonna catch, Miss Celia.
You just wait and see.

1270
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:24,267
We got married 'cause I was pregnant.

1271
01:26:26,682 --> 01:26:29,026
Then I lost it a month later.

1272
01:26:31,561 --> 01:26:33,529
Johnny wants kids now.

1273
01:26:37,067 --> 01:26:38,819
What's he gonna do with me?

1274
01:26:41,863 --> 01:26:43,115
Well...

1275
01:26:44,533 --> 01:26:46,535
Mr. Johnny just gonna have
to get over it.

1276
01:26:46,702 --> 01:26:48,921
[Exhaling]

1277
01:26:49,079 --> 01:26:51,127
He doesn't know about the baby.

1278
01:26:55,335 --> 01:26:57,212
Or the two before.

1279
01:27:05,721 --> 01:27:07,849
[Sniffing]

1280
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:44,684
[indistinct chattering]

1281
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:53,443
[man] Yule Mae Davis?

1282
01:27:56,354 --> 01:27:58,652
- What do you want me to do?
- You're under arrest.

1283
01:27:59,858 --> 01:28:03,203
Just call my husband.
Just call my husband.

1284
01:28:06,907 --> 01:28:10,207
- Wait a minute. I want my purse.
- No, you're under arrest.

1285
01:28:10,368 --> 01:28:14,168
I want to get my purse. [shouting]
I want to get my purse! Aibee!

1286
01:28:14,956 --> 01:28:17,129
- Don't fight, Yule Mae!
- Aibee!

1287
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:21,388
Aibee, I want my purse! I want my purse!

1288
01:28:22,881 --> 01:28:23,928
[Sobbing]

1289
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:27,223
Just let me go!

1290
01:28:28,011 --> 01:28:30,264
Yule Mae, don't fight.

1291
01:28:38,814 --> 01:28:41,943
[Hilly] I knew she was a thief
the day she started.

1292
01:28:42,776 --> 01:28:46,952
A nigra walks into a pawn shop
with a ring of such size and color.

1293
01:28:48,281 --> 01:28:51,376
It took them all of ten minutes
to find out where she worked.

1294
01:28:53,411 --> 01:28:55,709
I am desperate for
a grilled cheese sandwich.

1295
01:28:55,872 --> 01:28:58,295
Are you? Are you?
Do you want a grilled cheese sandwich?

1296
01:28:58,458 --> 01:29:00,131
- [Billy] Oh, yes.
- [Hilly laughing]

1297
01:29:00,293 --> 01:29:02,045
Just go sit down over there.

1298
01:29:02,212 --> 01:29:04,260
[Dishes clattering]

1299
01:29:08,718 --> 01:29:13,098
Miss Skeeter, you best head on over
to Miss Aibileen's house.

1300
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:14,891
Now.

1301
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:47,553
I'm gonna help with your stories.

1302
01:29:48,925 --> 01:29:51,269
I'm gonna help, too. Mm-hm.

1303
01:29:53,138 --> 01:29:54,310
We all are.

1304
01:29:54,472 --> 01:29:57,442
- [All] That's right.
- I'll help you.

1305
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:01,279
[Woman] I used to take
a shortcut every day

1306
01:30:01,438 --> 01:30:04,157
when I went to work
at Dr. Dixon's house.

1307
01:30:04,816 --> 01:30:07,865
Cut through that farmer's lower 40
to get there.

1308
01:30:08,028 --> 01:30:11,874
One day this farmer
was waiting for me with a gun.

1309
01:30:12,032 --> 01:30:15,627
Said he'd shoot me dead
if I walked on his land again.

1310
01:30:16,328 --> 01:30:22,051
Dr. Dixon went and paid that farmer
double for two of those acres.

1311
01:30:22,584 --> 01:30:25,428
Told him he was gonna
start farming, too.

1312
01:30:26,379 --> 01:30:31,055
But he bought that just for me,
so I could get to work easy.

1313
01:30:32,344 --> 01:30:33,561
He did.

1314
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:36,769
I worked for Miss Jolene's mother
till the day she died.

1315
01:30:37,641 --> 01:30:41,145
Then her daughter, Miss Nancy,
asked me to come and work for her.

1316
01:30:42,228 --> 01:30:44,526
Miss Nancy is a real sweet lady.

1317
01:30:45,523 --> 01:30:49,903
But Miss Jolene's ma done put it in her
will I got to work for Miss Jolene.

1318
01:30:50,946 --> 01:30:53,790
Miss Jolene's a mean woman.

1319
01:30:53,949 --> 01:30:55,496
Mean for sport.

1320
01:30:57,827 --> 01:31:00,501
Lord, I tried to find another job.

1321
01:31:01,581 --> 01:31:03,709
But in everybody's mind

1322
01:31:03,875 --> 01:31:07,254
the French family
and Miss Jolene owned me.

1323
01:31:09,422 --> 01:31:10,765
Owned me.

1324
01:31:16,513 --> 01:31:18,311
[Miss Stein] I leave early
this week for Thanksgiving.

1325
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:21,272
Our last editors' meeting
is December 17th,

1326
01:31:21,434 --> 01:31:23,186
so if you want a prayer
of this getting read,

1327
01:31:23,353 --> 01:31:26,357
- I'd better have it by then.
- That's in three weeks, Miss Stein.

1328
01:31:26,523 --> 01:31:29,026
Well, otherwise it goes in the pile.

1329
01:31:29,192 --> 01:31:31,991
You do not want it in the pile.

1330
01:31:32,153 --> 01:31:33,245
Yes, ma'am.

1331
01:31:33,405 --> 01:31:36,750
And put something personal in there.
Write about the maid who raised you.

1332
01:31:38,118 --> 01:31:39,461
I understand.

1333
01:31:47,127 --> 01:31:49,926
Well, we have a lot of work to do
before the benefit, don't we?

1334
01:31:50,088 --> 01:31:53,092
I know, but I think We're on track.
We're doing quite well.

1335
01:32:00,223 --> 01:32:01,270
[Doorbell ringing]

1336
01:32:01,433 --> 01:32:02,935
- it's so good.
- Mm-hm.

1337
01:32:03,101 --> 01:32:04,944
- Who's there?
- I don't know.

1338
01:32:05,729 --> 01:32:06,730
Aibileen?

1339
01:32:09,232 --> 01:32:10,825
Hey, Elizabeth!

1340
01:32:10,984 --> 01:32:13,328
It's me, Celia Foote.

1341
01:32:13,486 --> 01:32:15,284
[Hilly stammering]

1342
01:32:15,447 --> 01:32:18,917
I was in the neighborhood.
Thought I'd drop by.

1343
01:32:20,577 --> 01:32:23,296
Everybody hide.
Everybody get down, get down.

1344
01:32:24,205 --> 01:32:26,458
Get down! Get down! Get down!

1345
01:32:29,669 --> 01:32:31,592
- Turn off the music.
- Who are we hiding from?

1346
01:32:31,755 --> 01:32:33,598
- Shh!
- [music stops]

1347
01:32:36,926 --> 01:32:39,679
- Hey!
- [all gasping, giggling]

1348
01:32:39,846 --> 01:32:40,893
Shh!

1349
01:32:44,809 --> 01:32:46,152
I brought a chocolate pie!

1350
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,733
My maid, Minny, made it.

1351
01:32:52,067 --> 01:32:54,570
[All giggling]

1352
01:32:58,073 --> 01:33:00,326
[woman] She's in the bushes.

1353
01:33:22,138 --> 01:33:26,894
Don't be taking those women
any more pies, you understand?

1354
01:33:35,193 --> 01:33:38,618
They made me stand there like I was
the vacuum salesman.

1355
01:33:40,698 --> 01:33:41,870
Why, Minny?

1356
01:33:43,993 --> 01:33:47,873
Because they know about you getting
knocked up by Mr. Johnny.

1357
01:33:48,039 --> 01:33:49,962
Mad you married one of their mens.

1358
01:33:50,792 --> 01:33:54,717
And especially since Miss Hilly and
Mr. Johnny had just broke up, too.

1359
01:33:54,879 --> 01:33:57,428
Hilly probably thinks that I was
fooling around with Johnny

1360
01:33:57,590 --> 01:33:59,263
when they were still going steady.

1361
01:33:59,425 --> 01:34:01,519
Mm-hm.

1362
01:34:01,678 --> 01:34:05,933
And Missus Walters always said Miss
Hilly still sweet on Mr. Johnny, too.

1363
01:34:07,809 --> 01:34:09,311
No wonder!

1364
01:34:12,313 --> 01:34:16,489
They don't hate me.
They hate what they think I did.

1365
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:20,034
They hate you 'cause they think
you white trash.

1366
01:34:20,196 --> 01:34:23,120
I'm just going to have to tell Hilly
I ain't no boyfriend stealer.

1367
01:34:24,742 --> 01:34:27,541
In fact, I'll tell her Friday night
at the benefit.

1368
01:34:28,663 --> 01:34:30,961
You don't need to be going
to that benefit, Miss Celia.

1369
01:34:33,126 --> 01:34:35,720
Did you hear me? You just stay home.

1370
01:34:39,841 --> 01:34:41,013
That looks bad.

1371
01:34:43,386 --> 01:34:44,729
Let me take a look.

1372
01:34:45,597 --> 01:34:47,270
I got to get these peas on.

1373
01:34:47,432 --> 01:34:50,185
I know you didn't fall
in no tub, Minny.

1374
01:34:50,393 --> 01:34:51,895
[sighing]

1375
01:35:11,456 --> 01:35:14,005
You know what I'd do if I were you?

1376
01:35:15,752 --> 01:35:17,846
I'd give it right back to him.

1377
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:22,259
I'd hit him over the head
with a skillet,

1378
01:35:22,425 --> 01:35:25,178
and I'd tell him, "Go straight to hell."

1379
01:35:30,516 --> 01:35:32,518
[church bell tolling]

1380
01:35:35,605 --> 01:35:37,949

From here, the members of the family...

1381

...visitors from foreign countries
and others

1382
01:35:44,822 --> 01:35:47,826
will walk to St. Matthew's Cathedral.

1383
01:35:54,374 --> 01:35:57,173
Senator Edward Kennedy
getting out of the car.

1384

Mrs. Kennedy.

1385

Robert Kennedy, Attorney General.

1386
01:36:04,133 --> 01:36:06,227
Sweetheart, I gotta
get down to the coast.

1387
01:36:07,512 --> 01:36:09,139
I'll be back in time for the benefit.

1388
01:36:21,442 --> 01:36:23,865
The world done gone crazy,
Miss Skeeter, and I'm scared.

1389
01:36:24,612 --> 01:36:27,866
What if people ind out what we writing,
figure out Niceville really Jackson,

1390
01:36:28,032 --> 01:36:29,375
figure out who who?

1391
01:36:32,578 --> 01:36:34,501
Maybe we need us some insurance.

1392
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:40,470
[Sighs]
I told God I'd never speak of it again.

1393
01:36:41,671 --> 01:36:43,469
But we ain't got no choice.

1394
01:36:44,966 --> 01:36:45,967
Sorry.

1395
01:36:47,093 --> 01:36:50,973
I need to tell y'all about the terrible
awful I done to Miss Hilly.

1396
01:36:52,473 --> 01:36:54,601
It might be the only thing
that keep us safe.

1397
01:36:59,522 --> 01:37:01,069
Mmm.

1398
01:37:01,232 --> 01:37:03,200
Mm-mm-mm.

1399
01:37:06,571 --> 01:37:07,823
So...

1400
01:37:09,657 --> 01:37:12,501
Nobody wanted to hire a sass-mouthing,
thieving nigra.

1401
01:37:15,371 --> 01:37:16,543
Did they?

1402
01:37:23,921 --> 01:37:26,515
Oh. Pie's as good as always, Minny.

1403
01:37:26,674 --> 01:37:27,926
I'm glad you like it.

1404
01:37:28,092 --> 01:37:29,469
Mmm.

1405
01:37:31,095 --> 01:37:33,143
Oh.

1406
01:37:33,306 --> 01:37:38,233
If I take you back, I'll have to cut
your pay five dollars a week.

1407
01:37:38,394 --> 01:37:39,862
Take me back?

1408
01:37:42,357 --> 01:37:46,112
What do you put in here
that makes it taste so good?

1409
01:37:46,277 --> 01:37:49,030
That good vanilla from Mexico...

1410
01:37:49,197 --> 01:37:51,825
...and something else real special.

1411
01:37:53,368 --> 01:37:54,620
Mmm.

1412
01:37:54,786 --> 01:37:58,962
No, no, no, Missus Walters.
That's Miss Hilly's special pie.

1413
01:38:01,959 --> 01:38:03,381
Mama can have a piece.

1414
01:38:05,380 --> 01:38:07,428
[Scoffing] Cut her one.

1415
01:38:09,217 --> 01:38:10,560
Go get a plate.

1416
01:38:14,347 --> 01:38:15,348
[Slamming pie down]

1417
01:38:15,515 --> 01:38:16,732
Eat my shit.

1418
01:38:20,978 --> 01:38:22,355
What'd you say?

1419
01:38:22,939 --> 01:38:26,569
I said, "Eat... my... shit."

1420
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:37,503
Have you lost your mind?

1421
01:38:39,163 --> 01:38:44,465
No, ma'am, but you about to,
'cause you just did.

1422
01:38:45,169 --> 01:38:47,797
Did what?

1423

[gasping]

1427
01:39:08,860 --> 01:39:10,908
And you didn't eat just one.

1428
01:39:11,070 --> 01:39:13,243
- You had two slices!
- [Hilly coughing]

1429
01:39:13,448 --> 01:39:15,166

1430
01:39:15,324 --> 01:39:16,997
[dish clattering]

1431
01:39:23,332 --> 01:39:26,085
Run, Minny, run!

1432
01:39:30,673 --> 01:39:32,266
You trying to get yourself killed?

1433
01:39:32,425 --> 01:39:35,349
No! I wasn't planning on telling.

1434
01:39:37,305 --> 01:39:39,148
I just wanted to see her take a bite.

1435
01:39:40,433 --> 01:39:44,313
Then I was gonna leave.
Be done with her forever.

1436
01:39:45,521 --> 01:39:48,240
Before I knew it, I had done
told that woman what was in that pie!

1437
01:39:51,235 --> 01:39:53,112
I done ask God to forgive me.

1438
01:39:55,114 --> 01:39:57,993
But more for what happened
to poor Miss Walters.

1439
01:40:00,036 --> 01:40:04,792
Miss Hilly threw her in that
nursing home... just for laughing.

1440
01:40:06,375 --> 01:40:08,093
[Aibileen]
We can't put that story in the book.

1441
01:40:08,961 --> 01:40:10,338
We ain't got no choice.

1442
01:40:11,047 --> 01:40:14,551
Hilly Holbrook can't let nobody know
that pie story about her.

1443
01:40:14,717 --> 01:40:16,845
Exactly. If people find out
the terrible awful

1444
01:40:17,011 --> 01:40:19,264
was you and Miss Hilly
we in trouble there ain't words for.

Right! But don't you see?

1446
01:40:21,682 --> 01:40:24,982
She gonna go to her grave convincing
folks this book ain't about Jackson.

1447
01:40:25,144 --> 01:40:27,897
Now, that keeps us safe. Insured.

1448
01:40:29,232 --> 01:40:30,609
No.

1449
01:40:31,651 --> 01:40:32,994
No, that's too dangerous.

[Dishes clattering]

1451
01:40:37,406 --> 01:40:40,785
Y'all two brought me into this,
but I'm gonna finish it.

1452
01:40:41,661 --> 01:40:45,006
Either put it in, or pull my parts
out altogether. Y'all pick!

What are you trying to do to me?
What are you and that nigra up to?

I don't know what you're talking about.

1522
01:44:57,333 --> 01:44:58,880
You liar! Who did you tell?

1523
01:44:59,043 --> 01:45:01,341
Hilly, I got pregnant
after you and Johnny broke up!

1524

- Oh, shit!
- Shut up, Mother!

you won that pie!

anybody, I will make her suffer!

01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:01,943
You throw that pie away right now.

1543
01:46:02,106 --> 01:46:04,234
I spent good money on this pie.

1544
01:46:05,150 --> 01:46:06,948
I won it just for you.

1545
01:46:07,111 --> 01:46:09,239
You signed me up?

1546
01:46:09,405 --> 01:46:13,455
I may have trouble remembering my own
name, or what country I live in,

1547
01:46:13,617 --> 01:46:16,040
but there are two things
I can't seem to forget:

1548
01:46:16,203 --> 01:46:19,753
that my own daughter
threw me into a nursing home,

1549
01:46:19,915 --> 01:46:21,917
and that she ate Minny's shit.

1550
01:46:23,002 --> 01:46:24,174
Good night.

1551
01:46:28,382 --> 01:46:31,852
- Hey, how about a nightcap?
- Let's go.

1552
01:46:38,976 --> 01:46:42,150
I'm not right for this
kind of life, Minny.

1553
01:46:44,023 --> 01:46:47,197
I don't need a dining room table
for 12 people.

1554
01:46:48,027 --> 01:46:51,406
I couldn't get two people
over here if I begged.

1555
01:46:55,701 --> 01:46:58,045
I can't do this to Johnny any more.

1556
01:47:00,456 --> 01:47:02,754
That's why I've gotta go back
to Sugar Ditch.

1557

So Miss Hilly thought you knew about
the terrible awful.

1562

That you was making fun of her.

1563

It's my fault she pounced on you.

If you leave Mr. Johnny...

1565
01:47:44,708 --> 01:47:47,803
...then Miss Hilly done won
the whole ball game.

1566
01:47:49,964 --> 01:47:51,807
Then she done beaten me...

1567

1573
01:48:24,540 --> 01:48:28,670
Well, I have one more story to type
before I put it in the mail,

1574

1577

I need to talk to you about Constantine.

She didn't give me a choice.

1583

appointed me state regent.

- [Charlotte] Rachel.

We were expecting you next week.

1597
01:50:12,898 --> 01:50:14,696

and surprise Mama.

1604

I'm just doing as I was told,
Miss Charlotte.

1606

- Hello, Mama.

1608

Go on to the kitchen, baby.
I'll be there directly.

You may put up with this kind
of nonsense, but I do not.

1610

Get out of this house, Rachel.

1611
01:51:10,122 --> 01:51:12,500
You heard her. Go on, girl.

1612
01:51:12,666 --> 01:51:16,796
Miss Charlotte, let me take her to
the kitchen. Come on, baby. Let's go.

Leave. Now.

Come on, Mama.

Come on now.

1618

Constantine didn't do anything wrong.

1619
01:52:26,657 --> 01:52:28,580
And you love Rachel. I know you do.

1620
01:52:28,742 --> 01:52:31,916
She was our president.
What was I supposed to do?

1621
01:52:32,913 --> 01:52:37,259
She did you the biggest favor of
your life. She taught me everything.

1622
01:52:37,417 --> 01:52:40,591
Well, you idolized her too much.
You always have.

1623
01:52:40,754 --> 01:52:42,882
I needed someone to look up to.

1624

Well, I...

1625
01:52:48,512 --> 01:52:52,187
I went to her house the next day,
but she had already gone.

1626
01:53:22,921 --> 01:53:24,468
How could you not tell me all this?

1627
01:53:24,631 --> 01:53:28,135
Because I didn't want to upset you
during your final exams.

1628
01:53:28,302 --> 01:53:31,021
I knew you'd blame me,
and it wasn't my fault!

1629
01:53:31,179 --> 01:53:32,772
I have to go find her. She needs me.

1630

- Eugenia.
- What?

1631
01:53:36,143 --> 01:53:39,613
We sent your brother up to Chicago
to bring Constantine home.

1632

When he got there...

1633

that money up and gave it to each of us.

Remember her? Had you in her wedding.

1711
02:02:02,649 --> 02:02:05,869
Let's just say Aibileen ought to have
been a little bit smarter

1712
02:02:06,027 --> 02:02:08,701
before putting in about that
L-shaped scratch

1713
02:02:08,863 --> 02:02:11,537
in poor Elizabeth's dining table.

1714
02:02:13,618 --> 02:02:17,418
And that nigger Minny,
do I have plans for her.

1715
02:02:18,081 --> 02:02:22,882
- Careful, Hilly. That's chapter 12.
- [gasping]

1716
02:02:23,044 --> 02:02:25,217
Don't give yourself away now.

1717
02:02:25,672 --> 02:02:27,299
That was not me!

1718
02:02:28,216 --> 02:02:30,389
I've come to tell your mother
what a hippie you've become.

1719
02:02:30,552 --> 02:02:32,600
She's going to be disgusted by you.

1720
02:02:32,762 --> 02:02:36,392
Why, Hilly. Is everything OK, you two?

1721
02:02:36,558 --> 02:02:37,559
Oh, Mrs. Phelan.

1722
02:02:37,725 --> 02:02:41,605
Hilly, you're a sweaty mess.
Are you ill?

1723
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:43,481
No, ma'am.

1724
02:02:43,648 --> 02:02:48,620
Darling, oh, no husband wants
to come home and see that.

1725
02:02:48,945 --> 02:02:50,572
Oh.

1726
02:02:50,738 --> 02:02:52,206
I didn't have time to get fixed up.

1727
02:02:52,365 --> 02:02:54,333
You know, Hilly, if I didn't
know any better,

1728
02:02:54,492 --> 02:02:58,167
I'd say you've been eating too much pie.

1729
02:03:02,625 --> 02:03:05,925
Mrs. Phelan, I came here...

1730
02:03:06,087 --> 02:03:08,590
In fact, I'm sure of it.

1731
02:03:08,756 --> 02:03:10,975
Now you get your raggedy ass
off my porch.

1732
02:03:11,634 --> 02:03:13,511
Go on.

1733
02:03:13,678 --> 02:03:16,773
Get off my property. Now!

1734
02:03:17,849 --> 02:03:21,103
Before we all get one of those
disgusting things on our lips!

1735
02:03:22,353 --> 02:03:23,946
- [Laughs out loud]
- [car door slamming]

1736
02:03:24,105 --> 02:03:25,106
[engine starting]

1737
02:03:34,532 --> 02:03:36,284
[exhaling]

1738
02:03:36,451 --> 02:03:39,705
Eugenia. Take me inside, please.

1739
02:03:40,830 --> 02:03:41,831
Yes, ma'am.

1740
02:03:57,472 --> 02:04:00,476
Skeeter, do you have plans tomorrow?

1741
02:04:01,184 --> 02:04:02,811
- No, ma'am.
- Good.

1742
02:04:04,520 --> 02:04:07,023
Because we are going shopping.

1743
02:04:08,942 --> 02:04:11,411
No single daughter of mine is
going to New York City

1744
02:04:11,569 --> 02:04:13,162
representing the great state
of Mississippi

1745
02:04:13,321 --> 02:04:15,744
without a proper cosmopolitan wardrobe.

1746
02:04:15,907 --> 02:04:17,284
How do you know about New York?

1747
02:04:17,450 --> 02:04:20,249
Oh, well, Miss Stein called last night.

1748
02:04:27,961 --> 02:04:30,885
Courage sometimes skips a generation.

1749
02:04:33,841 --> 02:04:36,640
Thank you for bringing it back
to our family.

1750
02:04:45,937 --> 02:04:48,065
I can't leave you like this.

1751
02:04:48,564 --> 02:04:51,693
Eugenia, I have made a decision.

1752
02:04:51,859 --> 02:04:54,328
My health's been on the uptick
these last few weeks,

1753
02:04:54,487 --> 02:04:57,661
and I know the doctor says it's
some kind of last strength nonsense,

1754
02:04:57,824 --> 02:05:02,250
but I have decided not to die.

1755
02:05:07,750 --> 02:05:08,922
Oh, Mama.

1756
02:05:09,085 --> 02:05:10,803
It's too late.
I tried calling Fanny Mae's

1757
02:05:10,962 --> 02:05:13,215
to make all your hair appointments
for the next 20 years,

1758
02:05:13,381 --> 02:05:15,804
- but they wouldn't allow it.
- [chuckling]

1759
02:05:18,094 --> 02:05:22,565
I have never been more proud of you.

1760
02:05:27,478 --> 02:05:29,196
Thank you.

1761
02:05:37,822 --> 02:05:39,199
Mama.

1762
02:05:56,716 --> 02:05:58,844
[Music playing on radio]

1763
02:06:07,393 --> 02:06:08,895
Need some help with those?

1764
02:06:11,064 --> 02:06:12,281
Minny.

1765
02:06:12,440 --> 02:06:14,317
- Miss Celia!
- Minny, hey, stop! Minny!

1766
02:06:14,484 --> 02:06:16,111
- Miss Celia!
- Minny!

1767
02:06:16,277 --> 02:06:20,157
- Stay back!
- I'm not here to hurt you! Girl...

1768
02:06:22,075 --> 02:06:23,748
You gonna put the stick down?

1769
02:06:23,910 --> 02:06:25,628
Uh-uh.

1770
02:06:25,787 --> 02:06:27,835
[Breathing heavily]

1771
02:06:28,289 --> 02:06:31,839
Listen, Celia finally told me
about the babies.

1772
02:06:33,044 --> 02:06:34,387
All of them.

1773
02:06:36,172 --> 02:06:39,847
But I also know, the minute
you started working here,

1774
02:06:40,009 --> 02:06:41,852
she started getting better.

1775
02:06:42,970 --> 02:06:44,813
So, you saved her life.

1776
02:06:48,267 --> 02:06:50,986
You knew I was here the whole time?

1777
02:06:51,145 --> 02:06:54,445
[Laughs] Fried chicken and okra
on the first night?

1778
02:06:55,650 --> 02:06:58,153
Y'all could have at least put
some cornpone on the table.

1779
02:07:00,863 --> 02:07:02,035
No.

1780
02:07:03,699 --> 02:07:06,043
I couldn't let you eat no more cornpone,
Mr. Johnny.

1781
02:07:06,202 --> 02:07:09,046
Thanks to you, now I've had to let out
every pair of pants I own.

1782
02:07:17,046 --> 02:07:19,390
You just leave that.

1783
02:07:20,049 --> 02:07:21,392
Here you go.

1784
02:07:22,385 --> 02:07:24,058
Let's head on up the house.

1785
02:07:25,096 --> 02:07:26,097
[Snickering]

1786
02:07:48,744 --> 02:07:49,836
What's this?

1787
02:07:50,705 --> 02:07:52,378
I cooked it all by myself.

1788
02:07:52,540 --> 02:07:55,134
[Johnny] Yes, she did.
She was up all night.

1789
02:07:56,752 --> 02:07:58,846
I wanted to do something special.

1790
02:08:00,089 --> 02:08:02,217
I wanted to say thank you.

1791
02:08:05,386 --> 02:08:06,387
So...

1792
02:08:07,430 --> 02:08:09,023
...I ain't losing my job?

1793
02:08:11,017 --> 02:08:14,692
No, you got a job here
for the rest of your life.

1794
02:08:14,854 --> 02:08:16,071
If you want it.

1795
02:08:22,445 --> 02:08:24,539
That's a mile-high meringue, Miss Celia.

1796
02:08:24,697 --> 02:08:26,415
[giggles]

1797
02:08:33,998 --> 02:08:36,251
- Please.
- Thank you.

1798
02:08:40,254 --> 02:08:42,177
Ooh.

1799
02:08:42,340 --> 02:08:43,808
You remember to check the thighs?

1800
02:08:43,966 --> 02:08:47,561
- Mm-hm. Cooked clean through.
- Ain't pink in the middle?

1801
02:08:47,720 --> 02:08:50,894
Uh-uh. Just the way you taught me.

1802
02:08:51,057 --> 02:08:52,934
Looky here.

1803
02:08:56,771 --> 02:08:59,775
[Aibileen] That table of food
gave Minny the strength she needed.

1804
02:09:00,858 --> 02:09:05,455
She took her babies out from under Leroy
and never went back.

1805
02:09:09,992 --> 02:09:12,620
[Aibileen] What are all these cars
doing out here? Are we late?

1806
02:09:12,787 --> 02:09:14,130
No, we ain't late.

1807
02:09:15,748 --> 02:09:16,795
Why ain't you singing?

1808
02:09:16,958 --> 02:09:19,086
We got to worry about getting
in there and getting our seats.

1809
02:09:19,252 --> 02:09:20,469
Come on now, we late!

1810
02:09:22,588 --> 02:09:24,966
[Applause]

1811
02:09:29,428 --> 02:09:32,728
- Who we clapping for?
- Honey, we clapping for you!

1812
02:09:36,269 --> 02:09:37,987
Come on down, Sister Clark!

1813
02:09:38,896 --> 02:09:40,068
Come on.

1814
02:09:46,404 --> 02:09:49,032
[Crowd cheering, chattering]

1815
02:09:58,249 --> 02:09:59,671
Come on.

1816
02:10:02,461 --> 02:10:03,804
All right, all right.

1817
02:10:05,423 --> 02:10:10,600
Now, uh... this is an important time
in our community.

1818
02:10:11,387 --> 02:10:15,642
And we have to thank you
for what you have done.

1819
02:10:15,808 --> 02:10:17,355
[Crowd murmuring in agreement]

1820
02:10:18,019 --> 02:10:19,145
Now...

1821
02:10:20,271 --> 02:10:22,899
We know you couldn't put
your name in here,

1822
02:10:24,317 --> 02:10:26,035
so we all signed our own.

1823
02:10:28,446 --> 02:10:29,538
Thank you.

1824
02:10:31,866 --> 02:10:35,666
[Chuckles] Come on, now. Come on.

1825
02:10:39,373 --> 02:10:41,467
[Cheers and applause]

1826
02:10:57,224 --> 02:10:59,101
[cheering louder]

1827
02:11:13,240 --> 02:11:17,120
[Aibileen] Churches over two counties
signed our books. All for you and me.

1828
02:11:21,123 --> 02:11:22,466
It's beautiful.

1829
02:11:25,795 --> 02:11:26,921
What's wrong?

1830
02:11:33,135 --> 02:11:35,604
I got a job offer from Harper and Row
in New York.

1831
02:11:36,222 --> 02:11:38,020
Congratulations!

1832
02:11:38,182 --> 02:11:41,777
- I'm not taking it.
- What you mean you're not taking it?

1833
02:11:41,936 --> 02:11:43,563
I can't just leave you two here

1834
02:11:43,729 --> 02:11:46,152
when things are getting bad
from the mess that I created.

1835
02:11:46,315 --> 02:11:51,071
No. If bad things happen,
ain't nothing you can do about it.

1836
02:11:51,237 --> 02:11:53,615
And now it's for a reason
we can be proud of.

1837
02:11:55,866 --> 02:11:57,868
I don't mean to rub salt in your wound,

1838
02:11:58,035 --> 02:12:00,504
but you ain't got a good life here
in Jackson.

1839
02:12:00,663 --> 02:12:02,131
Plus, your mama's getting better.

1840
02:12:02,289 --> 02:12:05,668
You ain't got nothing left here
but enemies in the Junior League.

1841
02:12:05,835 --> 02:12:07,758
You done burned every bridge there is.

1842
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:10,389
And you ain't never gonna
get another man in this town.

1843
02:12:10,548 --> 02:12:12,767
- Everybody know that.
- [laughing]

1844
02:12:12,925 --> 02:12:16,350
So don't walk your white butt
to New York, run it!

1845
02:12:18,347 --> 02:12:22,022
Looky here, Miss Skeeter.
I'm gonna take care of Aibileen.

1846
02:12:24,186 --> 02:12:25,984
And she's gonna take care of me.

1847
02:12:37,741 --> 02:12:40,210
Go find your life, Miss Skeeter.

1848
02:12:41,620 --> 02:12:43,588
[Laughing]

1849
02:12:53,799 --> 02:12:56,177
[Elizabeth]
Aibileen, can you come in here, please?

1850
02:13:02,308 --> 02:13:03,355
Good morning.

1851
02:13:04,101 --> 02:13:08,982
Aibileen, the silver
I lent Elizabeth last week.

1852
02:13:09,148 --> 02:13:11,242
It not polished good?

1853
02:13:11,400 --> 02:13:14,654
Humidity been fighting me
on polishing day.

1854
02:13:14,820 --> 02:13:19,496
When you returned it, three pieces
were missing from the felt wrapper.

1855
02:13:20,826 --> 02:13:24,080
- A fork and two spoons.
- [breathing heavily]

1856
02:13:24,246 --> 02:13:27,796
Let me... Let me go check in the
kitchen. Maybe I left some behind.

1857
02:13:27,958 --> 02:13:31,007
You know as well as I do that silver's
not in the kitchen.

1858
02:13:33,339 --> 02:13:35,592
You check in Mae Mobley's bed?

1859
02:13:36,717 --> 02:13:38,811
Since the Lil Man was born,
she been putting things...

1860
02:13:38,969 --> 02:13:40,721
Do you hear her, Elizabeth?

1861
02:13:41,764 --> 02:13:43,562
She's trying to blame it on a toddler.

1862
02:13:45,726 --> 02:13:47,399
I ain't got no silver.

1863
02:13:47,561 --> 02:13:49,655
She says she doesn't have them.

1864
02:13:50,147 --> 02:13:54,402
Then it behooves me to inform you
that you are Tired, Aibileen.

1865
02:13:55,528 --> 02:13:57,701
And I'll be calling the police.

1866
02:13:59,615 --> 02:14:02,414
Aibee, my throat hurts.

1867
02:14:04,578 --> 02:14:07,297
I'll go get some syrup, Miss Leefolt.

1868
02:14:07,998 --> 02:14:10,501
Elizabeth can take care
of her own children.

1869
02:14:13,921 --> 02:14:16,765
- I'll go get the cough syrup.
- Come here, Lil Man.

1870
02:14:16,924 --> 02:14:18,346
I'm OK.

1871
02:14:28,727 --> 02:14:30,775
I didn't steal no silver.

1872
02:14:30,938 --> 02:14:34,659
Maybe I can't send you to jail
for what you wrote,

1873
02:14:34,817 --> 02:14:36,694
but I can send you for being a thief.

1874
02:14:36,860 --> 02:14:39,283
I know something about you.
Don't you forget that.

1875
02:14:39,989 --> 02:14:43,118
From what Yule Mae says, there's a lot
of time to write letters in jail.

1876
02:14:43,284 --> 02:14:46,959
Plenty of time to write the truth
about you. And the paper is free.

1877
02:14:47,121 --> 02:14:49,795
- Nobody will believe what you wrote!
- I don't know!

1878
02:14:50,332 --> 02:14:53,632
I been told I'm a pretty good writer.
Already sold a lot of books.

1879
02:14:54,628 --> 02:14:56,221
[Footsteps approaching]

1880
02:14:58,382 --> 02:15:00,555
Call the police, Elizabeth.
[gasps]

1881
02:15:01,302 --> 02:15:04,021
All you do is scare and lie
to try to get what you want.

1882
02:15:04,179 --> 02:15:05,180
[Elizabeth] Aibileen, stop!

1883
02:15:05,347 --> 02:15:07,395
You a godless woman.

1884
02:15:09,435 --> 02:15:11,529
Ain't you tired, Miss Hilly?

1885
02:15:14,189 --> 02:15:15,532
Ain't you tired?

1886
02:15:28,954 --> 02:15:31,377
Aibileen, you have to go now.

1887
02:15:46,013 --> 02:15:48,436
Don't go, Aibee.

1888
02:15:49,642 --> 02:15:51,986
Baby, you need to get back to bed.

1889
02:15:52,519 --> 02:15:56,569
- Please don't leave.
- I gots to, baby. I am so sorry.

1890
02:15:56,732 --> 02:15:59,485
Are you going to take care
of another little girl?

1891
02:15:59,652 --> 02:16:01,620
No, that's not the reason.

1892
02:16:01,779 --> 02:16:05,329
I don't want to leave you,
but it's time for me to retire.

1893
02:16:05,491 --> 02:16:07,744
- You're my last little girl.
- No!

1894
02:16:07,910 --> 02:16:09,912
Baby. Baby.

1895
02:16:10,913 --> 02:16:13,416
I need you to remember everything
I told you, OK?

1896
02:16:13,582 --> 02:16:15,710
- OK.
- You remember what I told you?

1897
02:16:15,876 --> 02:16:21,303
You is kind. You is smart.

1898
02:16:21,465 --> 02:16:23,138
You is important.

1899
02:16:23,300 --> 02:16:25,177
That's right, Baby Girl.

1900
02:16:30,391 --> 02:16:31,859
Don't go, Aibee.

1901
02:16:32,017 --> 02:16:33,234
I gots to, baby.

1902
02:16:35,896 --> 02:16:37,819
You give my sweet girl a chance.

1903
02:16:54,123 --> 02:16:56,376
[Aibileen] Mae Mobley was my last baby.

1904
02:16:58,836 --> 02:17:01,715
In just ten minutes,
the only life I knew was done.

1905
02:17:01,880 --> 02:17:04,599
[Screaming] Aibee!

1906
02:17:06,510 --> 02:17:07,807
[Mae Mobley screaming]

1907
02:17:07,970 --> 02:17:10,064
God says we need to love our enemies.

1908
02:17:10,222 --> 02:17:11,565
[Mae Mobley] No!

1909
02:17:13,475 --> 02:17:14,818
It hard to do.

1910
02:17:15,853 --> 02:17:17,526
[Yelling]

1911
02:17:21,066 --> 02:17:23,194
But it can start by telling the truth.

1912
02:17:28,365 --> 02:17:31,960
No one had ever asked me
what it felt like to be me.

1913
02:17:35,330 --> 02:17:37,378
Once I told the truth about that...

1914
02:17:39,376 --> 02:17:41,049
...I felt free.

1915
02:17:49,470 --> 02:17:52,565
And I got to thinking
about all the people I know.

1916
02:17:54,600 --> 02:17:56,602
And the things I seen and done.

1917
02:18:02,357 --> 02:18:06,703
My boy, Treelore, always said we going
to have a writer in the family one day.

1918
02:18:10,032 --> 02:18:12,160
I guess it's gonna be me.
