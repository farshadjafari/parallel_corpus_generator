1
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,074
<i>Most people</i>
<i>think of themselves as individuals,</i>

2
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,636
<i>that there's no-one on the planet like them</i>.

3
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,716
<i>This thought motivates them</i>
<i>to get out of bed,</i>

4
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,194
<i>eat food, and walk around</i>
<i>like nothing's wrong</i>.

5
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,629
<i>My name is Oliver Tate</i>.

6
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,711
Stuck On The Puzzle

7
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,675
# I'm not the kind of fool
who's gonna sit and sing to you

8
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,628
# About stars, girl

9
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,230
# But last night I looked up

10
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,239
# Into the dark half of the blue

11
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,313
# And they'd gone backwards

12
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,557
"What kind of young person am I?"

13
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,639
That's the challenge. We talk about challenges.

14
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,638
Well, that's the challenge
I'm giving you this term.

15
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,671
A gauntlet, so to speak.

16
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,757
But this gauntlet is also an opportunity.

17
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,156
An opportunity for self-discovery.

18
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,078
What do I mean by "self-discovery"?
Mark Pritchard?

19
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,834
Having a wank, sir?

20
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,269
Discovery of the self.

21
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,631
Who am I?

22
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,989
<i>I find that the only way to get through life</i>

23
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,396
<i>is to picture myself</i>
<i>in an entirely disconnected reality</i>.

24
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,949
<i>I often imagine</i>
<i>how people would react to my death</i>.

25
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,268
<i>Mr Dunthorne's quavering voice</i>
<i>as he makes the announcement</i>.

26
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,800
<i>The shocked faces of my classmates</i>.

27
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,073
<i>A playground bedecked with flowers</i>.

28
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,793
<i>The empty stillness of a school corridor</i>.

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,479
<i>Local news analysis</i>.

30
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,718
Oliver Tate was a popular
and much-loved pupil.

31
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,594
Many of the people I've spoken to here
referred to him as an example.

32
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,790
<i>He was so funny and so smart</i>.

33
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,479
<i>He's gonna be really missed</i>.
<i>It's so bad. He's so young</i>.

34
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,112
<i>Tear-streaked tributes</i>.

35
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,908
<i>I just wanted to hug him. I just wish I had</i>.

36
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,078
<i>I wish I could have said goodbye,</i>
<i>but I never said anything to him</i>.

37
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,076
<i>The steady stoicism of my parents</i>.

38
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,554
All the girls liked him.

39
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,594
Other boys respected him,
looked up to him, I guess.

40
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,189
<i>Candlelit vigils</i>.

41
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:25,678
<i>We are witnessing incredible,</i>
<i>unprecedented scenes of quiet devotion</i>.

42
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,999
Behind me a vigil that's been repeated
all over the country.

43
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,238
A testimony to the love felt for Oliver Tate

44
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,238
and the loss felt by his friends...

45
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,512
<i>and, frankly, by Wales on the whole</i>.

46
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,435
<i>And, finally, my glorious resurrection</i>.

47
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,832
Don't ask how. Just know
that I'm now more powerful than ever.

48
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,196
Let's get off.

49
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,830
Zoe.

50
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,238
Zoe, this is for you. It's yours.
It has your name on it. Take it.

51
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,077
- It's not mine.
- Please take it.

52
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,078
That note seems fascinating, Oliver Tate.

53
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,475
You know the rules. Stand up and read it out.

54
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,399
I can't. It's Zoe's.
She gave it to me and I was gonna...

55
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,318
Saved by the bell once again, Mr Tate.

56
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,839
All right, take your time.

57
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,350
I know you're all gagging
to get to double Biology but don't rush.

58
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,593
<i>Jordana Bevan's only real flaws</i>
<i>are her sporadic bouts of eczema</i>.

59
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,237
<i>Other than that, she has many qualities</i>.

60
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,633
<i>She never speaks about herself</i>.
<i>She could be anything</i>.

61
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,036
<i>Perhaps she's a Fabian</i>.

62
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,958
<i>That would make her a socialist</i>
<i>who advocates gradual change</i>.

63
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,558
<i>She's moderately unpopular, which makes</i>
<i>a romance between us more likely</i>.

64
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,151
<i>She's also a girl - to be seen with her</i>
<i>would improve my street cred,</i>

65
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,872
<i>which, though high, could be higher</i>.

66
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,796
<i>Lastly, she's now single,</i>

67
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,710
<i>cos Mark Pritchard cheated on her</i>
<i>with Abby Smuts at the school disco</i>.

68
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,514
<i>The full extent of the betrayal</i>
<i>is still the subject of speculation</i>.

69
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,433
<i>Chips knows there's</i>
<i>nothing more attractive than a bully</i>.

70
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,110
<i>He also knows that Zoe Preece</i>
<i>is a legitimate target</i>

71
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,072
<i>because she's overweight</i>
<i>and won't accept notes in class</i>.

72
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,270
<i>Essentially, I disapprove of bullying</i>.

73
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,076
<i>Jordana seems to enjoy it in moderation</i>.

74
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,957
<i>I must not let my principles</i>
<i>stand in the way of progress</i>.

75
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,436
<i>I must be willing to adapt</i>.

76
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,719
Keep up, Tubs!

77
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,191
<i>This was the correct decision</i>.

78
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,798
Give it back now!

79
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,835
<i>This was a vivid memory of youth that I</i>
<i>would cherish when I was old and frail</i>.

80
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,108
Oh!

81
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,957
Catch. Straight into the hands.

82
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,310
<i>We were working as a team,</i>
<i>testing each other's limits,</i>

83
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,989
<i>challenging one another's bourgeois</i>
<i>assumptions of what was acceptable</i>.

84
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,110
Oh, grow up! Grow up!

85
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,670
<i>I knew that these events - although</i>
<i>hard to bear at this precise moment -</i>

86
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,157
<i>would help build Zoe Preece's</i>
<i>character in the long term</i>.

87
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,749
Aargh!

88
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,151
Wanker!

89
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,112
Honestly, Zoe, it was an accident.

90
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,916
I mean, it was just unlucky
that you were there and that you fell in.

91
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,430
We were playing... sort of like a game.

92
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,954
And you can replace the stuff
that was in your bag.

93
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,358
- I'm not saying it's cheap...
- Fuck off and die!

94
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,149
<i>In many ways, I prefer my own company</i>.

95
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,477
<i>It gives me time to think</i>.

96
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,149
<i>I suppose it's a bit of an affectation,</i>
<i>but I often read the dictionary</i>.

97
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,159
<i>My word for today is "flagitious",</i>
<i>which means wickedly shameful</i>.

98
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,195
<i>I live in a large house with my parents</i>.

99
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,279
<i>They tell me that our area</i>
<i>has breathtaking scenery</i>.

100
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,950
<i>I'm not sure I believe in scenery</i>.

101
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,119
<i>However, the views allow me</i>
<i>to spy on our new neighbours</i>.

102
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,552
<i>I don't know them yet</i>
<i>but they seem like terrible human beings</i>.

103
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,352
Ninjas.

104
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,840
<i>My parents have not had sex</i>
<i>for seven months</i>.

105
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,790
<i>I've been monitoring their intimacy</i>
<i>via the dimmer switch in their bedroom</i>.

106
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,869
<i>I know when they've been at it</i>
<i>because the dial will be set to halfway</i>.

107
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,631
<i>I wish life could be more like</i>
<i>American soap operas</i>.

108
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,275
<i>Then, whenever things got dramatic,</i>

109
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,949
<i>you could just fade the picture down</i>
<i>and pick things up again later</i>.

110
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,309
Can you tell your mother to hurry up?
I'll be waiting in the road.

111
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,834
- You look nice.
- Thank you.

112
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,919
Yeah, you look good for your age. For a mum.

113
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,111
Mum's getting the bus.

114
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,393
So... I inherited it all.

115
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,353
Well, er, it's been terrific. Small world, all that.

116
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,311
It's such a lovely area.

117
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,828
This used to be Jill's grandmother's house,
right?

118
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,916
Yes.

119
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,839
The hours we spent up in that room,
listening to records, hatching plans.

120
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,758
Right, yes.
So are you going to be selling up?

121
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,075
Just gonna let things take their own path.

122
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,269
- You have a good day, Lloyd.
- OK, cheers, Graham.

123
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,631
- Give my love to Jill.
- Will do.

124
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,591
- Ciao, Lloyd.
- Goodbye.

125
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,751
- You go get 'em, killer.
- I will.

126
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,273
<i>As usual, Dad drops me 800 yards from school</i>.

127
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,429
<i>That way, I can slip in unnoticed, like a torpedo</i>.

128
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,357
Watch your step, motherfucker! Ha-ha

129
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,153
You've got to wake up.
How many times have I told you?

130
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,997
- Ellis?
- Yes, sir.

131
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,758
- Griffiths?
- Here, sir.

132
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,233
- Harris?
- Yes, sir.

133
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,838
- Davies?
- Yes, sir.

134
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,552
- Morris?
- Sir.

135
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,033
Preece?

136
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,514
Preece? Anyone seen Zoe?

137
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,269
- Tate?
- Yeah, present.

138
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,756
- Pritchard?
- Yes.

139
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,199
Smuts?

140
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,312
Wanker!

141
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,115
<i>Zoe Preece hasn't been in school for a while,</i>

142
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,994
<i>so I've written a pamphlet</i>
<i>on how to break out of the victim cycle</i>.

143
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,753
<i>I've also given her two examples to inspire her</i>.

144
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,792
<i>Firstly, Rhydian Bird,</i>

145
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,752
<i>who pulled his trousers down to fart</i>
<i>and followed through,</i>

146
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,394
<i>calling an unhealthy turd onto the tarmac</i>.

147
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,513
<i>But instead of looking embarrassed,</i>
<i>he screamed with laughter and pointed</i>.

148
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,915
<i>Nobody could tease him about it</i>
<i>cos he was so proud</i>.

149
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,712
How do you even know all men read poems?

150
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,075
All men do, unless you're gay. Are you gay?

151
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,588
<i>Secondly, Chips</i>.
<i>He wasn't even considered hot</i>

152
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,916
<i>until the Watkins twins stabbed him</i>
<i>in the back with compasses</i>.

153
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,235
<i>He said nothing, showed no discomfort</i>

154
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,589
<i>as his shirt blossomed with blood poppies</i>.

155
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,916
<i>His stoicism reminded me of the brave men</i>
<i>who died in the First World War</i>.

156
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,037
<i>Chips is an outstanding bully</i>.

157
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,029
<i>He once made our Religious Education teacher</i>
<i>cry using only Blu-Tack</i>.

158
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,638
Right, now, now, now.

159
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,192
<i>I don't quite know what I am yet</i>.

160
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,631
<i>I've tried smoking a pipe</i>...

161
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,398
...<i>flipping coins</i>...

162
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,113
<i>listening exclusively to French crooners</i>.

163
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,958
<i>Other times I go to the beach</i>
<i>and stare at the sea</i>.

164
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,798
<i>Someone made a documentary</i>
<i>about a prominent thinker</i>

165
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,831
<i>who struggled with unspeakable loss</i>.

166
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,792
<i>I've even had a brief hat phase</i>.
<i>But nothing stuck</i>.

167
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,112
- Gene.
- What?

168
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,596
<i>The most secure route to Zoe is big Gene,</i>

169
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,235
<i>who, over the last few months,</i>
<i>has become her only friend and confidante</i>.

170
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,236
<i>Gene told me that Zoe had moved schools</i>.

171
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:10,432
<i>She was very unhappy because she was bullied</i>
<i>and one boy even pushed her into a pond</i>.

172
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,357
Oh... I had no idea.

173
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,437
<i>I persuaded her to give Zoe the pamphlet</i>
<i>by saying it was a love letter</i>.

174
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,959
It's a big love letter.

175
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,956
I've got a big heart.

176
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,992
<i>Sometimes I wish there was a film crew</i>
<i>following my every move</i>.

177
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,112
<i>I imagine the camera craning up</i>
<i>as I walk away</i>.

178
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,878
<i>But, unless things improve,</i>

179
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,799
<i>the biopic of my life will only have</i>
<i>the budget for a zoom out</i>.

180
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,070
I feel bad, cutting into his head.

181
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,238
Why? It's just a fucking frog.

182
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,191
It's still a thing, though. It had life.

183
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,231
Where do you think they get the frogs?

184
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,396
I don't know.
Probably a lake or a river nearby.

185
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,829
They probably have a guy that does it.
I could find out.

186
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,996
- I don't actually want to know.
- Neither do I.

187
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,679
- I'm just saying. You asked...
- I wonder where Fat is.

188
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,869
- Zoe?
- Mm.

189
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,878
- She hasn't been in school for a while.
- I hadn't noticed.

190
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,036
I thought you would have.
She leaves a big gap.

191
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,513
She's not on my radar.

192
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,233
- Is it cos we pushed her into the pond?
- I didn't push her.

193
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,590
- Think she's weeping herself to death?
- I didn't push her.

194
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,198
Maybe you should write to her.

195
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,995
Maybe you should write her
a pamphlet or something.

196
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,873
What do you think?

197
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,559
<i>What is this?</i>

198
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,753
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

199
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,636
Meet me under the railway bridge after school
and we'll take it from there.

200
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,675
<i>Bring a Polaroid camera and a diary</i>.

201
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,879
OK?

202
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,399
- Got the camera and the diary?
- Do you have the pamphlet?

203
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,876
Give me the camera.

204
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,631
OK.

205
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,353
Now kneel down.

206
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,633
Please, Jordana... What is this?

207
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,796
Kneel down.

208
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,713
Close your eyes.

209
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,355
<i>We kissed until our lips felt swollen</i>.

210
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,315
<i>Her mouth tasted of milk, Polo mints</i>
<i>and Dunhill International</i>.

211
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,995
OK. Now take out the diary
and write today's date.

212
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,913
Write a few paragraphs on how excited
you are to have kissed me.

213
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,830
Mention what a dick Mark Pritchard is
and slag off Abby Sluts.

214
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,474
- It's Smuts.
- Let's call her Sluts.

215
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,273
I sit next to her in Geography, so we're mates.

216
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,197
I don't need your life story.

217
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,871
Wow. You look mentally retarded.

218
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,992
Have you ever kissed anyone before?

219
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,431
<i>I had in fact only kissed</i>
<i>one person before - Zoe Preece</i>.

220
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,997
<i>It was after the Cowboys And Indians</i>
<i>school disco</i>.

221
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,077
<i>I told her if we were going to do it,</i>
<i>we had to hide behind the refectory</i>.

222
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,315
<i>Her tongue was blue</i>
<i>from blackcurrant squash</i>.

223
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,157
<i>It smouldered in the cold</i>.

224
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,113
OK, I've done it.

225
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,035
Good.

226
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,391
- Can I have the pamphlet now?
- No.

227
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,796
- What will you do with the photos?
- Leave them lying around school.

228
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,717
For people to accidentally find.

229
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,193
Oh.

230
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,832
What are you complaining about?

231
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,599
This is conclusive proof
that you might not be gay.

232
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,598
Gaylord! Gaylord! Gaylord! Gaylord!

233
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,598
Gaylord! Gaylord! Gaylord! Gaylord!

234
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,919
Come on, gay boy, take back
what you said about me!

235
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,078
I take it back. I take it back.

236
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,839
And admit that you're in fact a gaylord.

237
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,871
No. Do not admit it.

238
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,354
- Do not admit that.
- Shut up, Chips.

239
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,470
Fine. I'm gay. I'm very gay.

240
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,838
And Jordana's a slut.

241
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,593
- Jordana is a slut.
- No.

242
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,598
Say it. Say it!

243
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,198
No.

244
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,716
Don't be a dick, Mark. Just let him go.

245
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,676
Fine. I'll let him go.

246
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,591
I'll let him go.

247
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,918
If... he admits you're a slut.

248
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,871
- Ooh.
- Just say it, gay boy.

249
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,717
Say it.

250
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,119
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
Fucking big gay.

251
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,236
I was completely overbalanced.

252
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:23,275
It was luck. I'm gonna get him for this.
I'll bring him so much pain.

253
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,595
Probably catch him like he caught me,
on the sly.

254
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,671
Blood.

255
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,513
- Are you gonna get up now?
- Yeah. Sorry, yeah.

256
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,148
- You've got scaly hands.
- It's eczema.

257
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,594
<i>Now that we had kissed</i>
<i>for non-blackmail purposes,</i>

258
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,032
<i>I thought it gentlemanly</i>
<i>to escort Jordana home</i>.

259
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,436
<i>When there, I asked if</i>

260
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,391
I'll think about it.

261
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,791
<i>But what she meant was, yes</i>.

262
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,391
<i>We are now as one</i>.

263
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,437
<i>Whenever I'm late home from school,</i>

264
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,952
<i>my mother assumes I've been abducted</i>
<i>and left to drown in a lake</i>.

265
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,071
There he is. Oliver?

266
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,109
<i>My mother is worried</i>
<i>that I have mental problems</i>.

267
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,994
<i>I found a book about</i>
<i>teenage paranoid delusions</i>

268
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,634
<i>during a routine search</i>
<i>of my parents' bedroom</i>.

269
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,877
<i>After that, I started slipping choice phrases</i>
<i>into our conversation</i>.

270
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,832
My body has been replaced by a shell.
My organs are made of stone.

271
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,757
- I've been dead for years.
- Right.

272
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,952
<i>My mother is naturally neurotic and in her youth</i>
<i>even dreamed of being an actress</i>.

273
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,959
<i>Until she was told by a speech therapist</i>
<i>her tongue was too big for her mouth</i>.

274
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,118
<i>Now she works for the council's Legal</i>
<i>and Democratic Services department</i>.

275
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,830
<i>One of the rules in her office</i>

276
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,916
<i>- is that if it's your birthday</i>...
- Ta-da.

277
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,599
...<i>you are held responsible</i>
<i>for bringing your own cake to work</i>.

278
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,596
- Happy birthday, Jill.
- Thank you.

279
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,393
Oliver?

280
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,751
Oliver, come here.

281
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,279
Come here.

282
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,591
Where are you going, Oliver?

283
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,918
OK, sit up.

284
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,629
- Are you being victimised again?
- No. I'm never victimised.

285
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,752
You were, in primary school and Cubs.

286
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,950
- I don't remember.
- I do. There was a lot of crying.

287
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,831
- Is it drug related?
- How?

288
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,791
- I don't know. You tell me.
- It's not.

289
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,751
- Your pupils are huge.
- It's dark.

290
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,598
- Is it self-harm?
- Why would I punch myself in the eye?

291
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,393
- I really don't know.
- I wouldn't. This is stupid.

292
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,193
I'm not going anywhere
until you tell me the truth.

293
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,551
OK, I got into a fight.

294
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,434
I was defending the honour of my girlfriend.

295
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,993
OK, fine.

296
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,031
You're not being serious, it's fine.

297
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,991
No, I am. I have a girlfriend now.

298
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,951
- Really?
- Yeah.

299
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,479
- Do you?
- Yeah.

300
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,033
- Really?
- Yeah.

301
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,991
Of course.

302
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,395
Yes, of course. I mean, why wouldn't... I didn't...

303
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,352
- Did you think I was...
- No, I didn't. Come here.

304
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,874
What a lovely little chat. You're doing so well.

305
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,155
So?

306
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,511
K-nock, k-nock, can I come in?

307
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,949
<i>This was the happiest</i>
<i>I'd seen my father for years</i>.

308
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,871
<i>Not too long ago, I discovered</i>
<i>an empty bottle of anti-depressants,</i>

309
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,959
<i>during another routine search</i>
<i>of my parents' bedroom</i>.

310
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,037
<i>My research indicates it all started</i>
<i>when he was sacked from his job</i>

311
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,036
<i>presenting on the Open University</i>.

312
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,991
<i>My father is a marine biologist,</i>

313
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,998
<i>and introduced a segment</i>
<i>called Mysteries Of The Deep</i>.

314
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,951
<i>But he was an uneasy screen presence</i>

315
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,468
<i>and never knew quite what to do with his hands</i>.

316
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,434
<i>After his dismissal,</i>
<i>he spent several days in bed,</i>

317
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,713
<i>drinking hot lemon from the same mug</i>
<i>and never washing it,</i>

318
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,751
<i>a key sign of one of his downturns</i>.

319
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,916
<i>Now he works at the local university,</i>

320
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,951
<i>doing a job he finds difficult to explain</i>

321
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,878
<i>to anyone without</i>
<i>a degree-level knowledge of fish</i>.

322
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,111
Listen, I hope you don't mind.

323
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,472
But your mother informs me
that you have a girlfriend.

324
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,875
Is there anything I can help you with there?

325
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,717
I'm not sure yet. I'll let you know.

326
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,398
OK. All right.

327
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,317
Yes. Er... listen...

328
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,749
I know you think I'm very boring, you know.

329
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,598
But once... I ripped my vest off
in front of a woman

330
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,993
and er... it was very effective, actually.

331
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,475
I know.

332
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,875
It produced a very atavistic response.

333
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,990
That's just something to bear in mind.

334
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,669
And listen, I made you a cassette recording.

335
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:51,593
It's a compilation of songs I used to listen to
during some of my early formative relationships.

336
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,235
Plus a couple of things I thought you might dig.

337
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,590
I think music can make things seem
a bit more real, sometimes,

338
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,471
- if you know what I mean.
- Thanks.

339
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,557
I've also included some break-up songs
towards the end,

340
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,194
just in case things don't work out.

341
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:10,075
Which, obviously, you know, that isn't the aim,
though, I'm gonna tell you, it is likely.

342
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,391
Passion rarely lasts, I'm afraid.

343
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,871
All right, well...

344
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,153
good night and erm... well done!

345
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,919
It's an achievement. It really is, of sorts.

346
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,995
Good night, son.

347
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,519
# Tomorrow I'll be quicker

348
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,357
# I'll stare into the strobe light flicker

349
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,598
# And afloat I'll stay

350
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,956
# But I'm quite all right hiding today

351
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,033
# Tomorrow I'll be faster

352
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,711
# I'll catch what I've been chasing after

353
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,038
# And have time to play

354
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,355
# But I'm quite all right hiding today

355
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,078
# And I will play the coconut shy

356
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,998
# And win a prize even if it's rigged

357
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,113
# I won't know when to stop

358
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,230
# And you can leave off my lid

359
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,831
# And I won't even lose my fizz

360
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,274
# I'll be the polka dots type

361
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:44,910
# I'll know the way back if you know the way

362
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,519
# But if you are, I am quite all right

363
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,956
# Hiding today

364
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,230

# Tomorrow

381
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,829

382
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:18,234
# So we can sail our laughing pianos

It's fucking ridiculous! How long's it been?

386
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,438
Two weeks. It's fucking ridiculous!

387
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,516
I'm not bothered. We've as good as done it.

388
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,552
Never take more than a week
between everything but and stuffing it in.

389
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,477
She's taking the piss. Keiron, back me up.

390
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,476
- She's taking the piss, man.
- Thank you.

391
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,431
Watch out, she's looking.

392
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,111
Is she still looking?

393
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,073
Yep.

394
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,832
<i>Jordana hates any place</i>

00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,671
This is nice, isn't it?

398
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,991
Yeah, it's not bad.

399
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,000
I mean, you know, we get on pretty well.

400
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,471
Yeah, it's fun.

401
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,909
And we're getting more and more intimate.

402
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,475
Intimate?

403
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,557
Yeah, you know, we've done things.
We've been intimate.

404
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,031
We have been intimate, yeah.

405
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,194
My parents are going to the cinema
on Thursday.

406
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,393
It's a tradition. They go every Thursday evening.

407
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,351
So what I'm saying is, it's empty.

408
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,115
The house. On Thursday. The house is empty.

409
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,835
On Thursday evening, it's an empty house.

410
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,791
So what do you think?

411
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,638
Are you asking me to come round
and have sex with you?

412
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,831
If I say yes, does that lessen
the chance of you wanting to?

413
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,678
Before I answer that,
I just want to check one thing.

414
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,188
- Yeah, sure. What is it?
- It's quite serious.

415
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:11,074
Of course, yeah. Go ahead, you should
be able to ask what you want to ask.

416
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,232
Will the house be empty?

417
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,791
Write down the reasons why I should.

418
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,355
OK.

419
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,238
It's Thursday. You're going to the cinema?
You should leave.

420
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,557
Is that what you wear to lounge around?

421
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,795
Your father doesn't want to go out
all of a sudden.

422
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,912
I've been looking forward to it.
I didn't realise there'd be others.

423
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,394
- They're our neighbours.
- Who, the ninjas?

424
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,034
It's Thursday, our cinema night.
It's not a free-for-all.

425
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,674
Do not call them ninjas, Oliver. It's racist.

426
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,948
He's white.

427
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,195
They don't strike me as big Eric Rohmer fans.

428
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,391
Why don't the three of you just go and see
some tat at the Odeon?

429
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,237
- I'll just stay in.
- You should both go.

430
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,191
So rude, Lloyd.

431
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,591
Oh, for God's sake.

432
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,591
- Oh, Graham.
- Whoa!

433
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,996
- Oh, not really...
- Hey.

434
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,917
Oh, thanks.

435
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,871
Are you all right?

436
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,993
Whoargh!

437
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,759
You look lovely.

438
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,234
- Thank you very much.
- Sorry I'm a bit early.

439
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,909
It's just, there's a fantastic
noodle bar right next to the cinema.

440
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,315
Kim-Lin and I would love to take
you and Lloyd...

441
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,237
- Ninjas.
- My treat.

442
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,794
- Very sweet.
- No need to take two cars, right?

443
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,398
Plenty of room in the van.

444
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,829
Do you mind jumping in the back, here, Lloyd?

445
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,799
Hop right in there,
make yourself comfortable.

446
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,191
All right there, buddy? Great.

447
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,031
Thanks for living up a fucking hill.

448
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,918
Sorry, I had to er... go to the toilet.

449
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,511
I'm OK now. It doesn't matter.

450
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,949
Just gonna top this up quickly.

451
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,671
There we go.

452
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,668
To us, and a wonderful evening of lovemaking.

453
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,792
Can you just get off my shoulders?

454
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,151
I'm just directing you, just...

455
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,230
Right, OK, just don't open them.
I'll tell you when. Stay there.

456
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,511
- What, now?
- Yeah.

457
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,516
Fucking hell, you're a serial killer.

458
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,398
I'm sorry for that.
I didn't know whether you'd like it.

459
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,149
But we can learn from it. I've learned from it.

460
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,351
I think you've learned from it.
Maybe we could start again.

461
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,198
- I've gotta go home.
- OK, cool. You should go home.

462
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,279
I'll give you this. It's just a letter
I was gonna give you. Just take it.

463
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,231
It's nothing.

464
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,836
- Sorry, but...
- No, no, I... Yeah...

465
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,191
- You...
- OK, bye.

466
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,832
<i>Dear Jordana, thank you for letting me</i>
<i>explore your perfect body</i>.

467
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,474
<i>I could drink your blood</i>.

468
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,671
You're the only person I would allow
to be shrunk to microscopic size

469
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,995
and swim inside me
in a tiny submersible machine.

470
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,793
We've lost our virginity
but it wasn't like losing anything.

471
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:44,833
You're too good for me.
You're too good for anyone. Sincerely, Oliver.

472
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,951
Don't get cocky.

473
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,511
How was the film?

474
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,359
I'm going to bed.

475
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,960
It's nice to see something lightweight
once in a while,

476
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,513
that you don't have to think about.

477
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,312
Relationships are tough, aren't they?

478
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,511
You should be in bed, Oliver.

479
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,830
<i>Tonight, I stumbled across</i>
<i>an encyclopaedia entry on ultrasound</i>.

480
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:06,034
<i>Ultrasound is a sound vibration</i>
<i>too high frequency to be audible</i>.

497

But I really laughed.
I thought it was very charming.

498
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:54,669

would go for someone like him.

<i>to feel threatened, Jackie</i>.

501
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,111
<i>He knows Graham was your first love</i>...

502
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,071
<i>- He wasn't my first love</i>.
<i>- Come on</i>.

503
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,553
<i>- I was 18</i>.
<i>- Pardon?</i>

504
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,989
18. Look, I've got to go. I'll call you back.

505
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,031
Actually, I'll see you tomorrow, OK.

506
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,878
Lloyd?

507
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,191
Were you listening in to that?

508
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,551
Sorry, what?

509
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,795
I could hear you breathe, Lloyd.

510
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:30,312
<i>Why hadn't my parents told me</i>
<i>that Graham was Mum's first love?</i>

511
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:34,036
<i>No wonder their cinema outing</i>
<i>had ended in such a schism</i>.

512
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,833
<i>I can only assume the subject</i>
<i>of wife-swapping was raised</i>

513
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,711
<i>and Dad didn't feel emotionally ready</i>.

514
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,395
<i>Is it possible that Mum would cheat on Dad?</i>

515
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,513
<i>Will they get divorced?</i>

516
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,234
<i>They don't even row</i>.

517
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,191
<i>They just have discussions</i>.

518
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,480
<i>I'm going to have to increase my surveillance</i>.

519
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,271
Good night, Oliver.

520
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,311
Yargh, yargh, yargh!

521
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,511
Yargh, yargh, yargh!

522
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,154
Yargh!

523
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,591
Thank you very much, Jeff.

524
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,193
I got you these books.
They're really meaningful to me.

525
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,757
This is Shakespeare's most mature work,
miles better than Hamlet.

526
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,552
Just more developed thematically.

527
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,275
And this is Nietzsche, one of the most
influential philosophers of modern time.

528
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,312
I don't agree with all he says
but he makes some interesting points.

529
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,909
And this is The Catcher In The Rye,
a great modern American novel.

530
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,871
Salinger's very influential.

531
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,433
Why are you doing this?

532
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,995
I thought it'd be nice to get some
mutual interest, now we've had sex,

533
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,349
other than spitting and setting things on fire.

534
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,311
Why would I want to be more like you?

535
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,555
Just try not to crack the spines or burn them.

536
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,956
We should get in. It starts in an hour.
I want to get a good seat.

537
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,276
It's rude to leave a film before it's finished.

538
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,039
- Who to?
- The film-makers.

539
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,513
- How do they know?
- They just do.

540
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,232
- How?
- They do.

541
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:21,397
- There wasn't even any sound on it.
- There was never intended to be.

542
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,476
- Then why did they write it?
- Kiss me.

543
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,433
Get off me!

544
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,549
- What are you doing?
- Just kiss me.

545
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,116
Get the fuck off me, you freak.

546
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,477
That was fucking ridiculous.

547
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,399
"Kiss me!" Who says that?

548
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,113
- It was a kiss. I tried to be romantic.
- What the fuck?

549
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,628
- You were crushing my face.
- Yeah, in a romantic way.

550
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,079
I'm not in the mood.

551
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,353
<i>It seems pretty clear</i>
<i>that Mum is having an affair</i>.

552
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,156
<i>Why else would she be at the hairdresser's</i>
<i>with Graham the ninja?</i>

553
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,794
<i>He probably makes sure</i>
<i>all his prospective sex partners</i>

554

555
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:00,876
Cheers.

556
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,230
<i>Mum normally just gets a trim</i>
<i>from her work colleague Jackie</i>.

557
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,437
<i>But now I think of it,</i>
<i>she did mention her hair the other day</i>.

558
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,271
I used to have long hair like her.

559
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,630
Hm?

560
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,591
I used to have long hair, remember?

561
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,551
Hm, yes.

562
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,477
Pretty, isn't she?

563
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,555
I dunno.

564
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,511
Do you like my hair long?

565
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,631
- Er...
- Or short like now?

566
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:27,110
Well, you know...
I like your hair no matter how long it is.

567
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,278
But did you prefer it long?

568
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,753
Either way's good.

569
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,153
No opinion.

570
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,111
Well, it's up to you.

571
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,720
So it wouldn't bother you if I shaved it all off?

572
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,193
Not if it made you happy.

573
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,310
If you want to shave off your hair, you should.

574
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,352
Why would I shave my hair off, Lloyd?
What a stupid idea.

575
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,914
Yeah.

576
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,310
<i>I can imagine my mum calmly leaving one day</i>
<i>while Dad helps her pack</i>.

577
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,831
So er... got any plans?

578
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,191
No, not really.

579
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,151
No, just...

580
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,111
see how it goes, really.

581
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,429
Are you planning on getting dressed today?

582
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,348
- Do you want to take the car?
- That's fine.

583
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,836
I'm going to work from home today
so if you want to take the car...

584
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,958
I was planning on going to see
one of Graham's talks tonight.

585
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,833
- OK.
- You don't mind?

586
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,633
- Why would I mind?
- It just means I won't be in tonight.

587
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,558
- I'll make sure I keep myself busy.
- Oliver, you coming?

588
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,989
- I'd like a moment with my father.
- Lovely.

589
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,951
I'll see you in the car.

590
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,591
I think Mum might be having an affair.

591
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,551
Can you turn the tap off, please?

592
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,870
I saw her in town with Graham
and heard her on the phone talking about him.

593
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,038
You shouldn't be spying on people.

594
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:14,356
I just saw them and accidentally
picked up the phone. Aren't you worried?

595
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,755
- Graham's an old friend of Mum's.
- They've met up.

596
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,677
- Yes.
- So you're condoning this affair?

597
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,030
There is no affair. He's just some bloke
I stole your mother from.

598
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,389
So you admit they have a history?

599
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,795
I think you should go to your mother now, OK?

600
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,711
- Thanks, Mum.
- Just a second, we're early.

601
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,071
How are things with Jordana?

602
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,439
Fine.

603
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:41,234
- You ever going to let us meet her?
- Maybe if you get a terminal illness.

604
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,316
So things are serious between you two?

605
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,955
It may seem like a big deal now
but it probably won't matter when you're my age.

606
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,750
38?

607
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,030
- Just be careful.
- I always use condoms.

608
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,035
Good.

609
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:54,629
You know that your dad and I
are going through a bit of a tough time.

610
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,990
And I want you to know
we really appreciate you trying to help.

611
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,793
- I'm not trying to help.
- You're a loud whisperer.

612
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,751
You shouldn't spy on people.

613
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,711
Why have you been meeting Graham?

614
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:08,673
Graham is an old friend and has had
relationship problems with Kim-Lin.

615
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,631
He needed someone he could talk to.

616
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,274
- So he might be single soon?
- Goodbye, Oliver.

617
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,675
- Mum?
- Yes?

618
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,599
Who would you save first in a fire,

619
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,030
given the hypothetical situation
that Dad and I were equally hard to save?

620
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,708
I'd go for you but I'd feel bad for your father.

621
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,957
OK.

622
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,991
- Kiss me!
- What?

623
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,630
I still can't believe you fucking said it.

624
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,558
I did not say it in a high-pitched...
like a little mouse.

625
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,591
- You cried it.
- Come on, we're late.

626
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,152
- That gap gets smaller every day.
- What are you doing tonight?

627
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,318
I'm busy tonight.

628
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,839
Doing what?

629
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,598
As in, I've got stuff to do. Busy.

630
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,234
No, you never have anything to do.
What are you doing?

631
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,751
What is light?

632
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,913
What is light?

633
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,393
How important is light?

634
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,876
OK, let's think about that for a minute.

635
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:24,598
Cos it seems very basic and banal but it's not.
It's loaded.

636
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,278
It's a bloody nail bomb.

637
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:31,430
I think light is probably
the most important gift we have

638
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,791
from the universe.

639
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,991
And if you asked any intelligent bloody writer,

640
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:40,557
like Professor Hawking or anybody of that ilk,

641
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,791
he could talk to you...

642
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:48,108
for about, I don't know, a year...

643
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,630
just about bloody light!

644
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,270
We don't want to be in the dark,

645
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,517
being fiddled with.

646
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,471
That's for sure.

647
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,431
<i>How's my dad meant to compete?</i>

648
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,391
<i>The only time I saw him enthral a room</i>

649
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:06,035
<i>was when he gave a talk about</i>
<i>the disappearance of a giant sturgeon</i>.

650
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,913
Sturgeons are royal fish, since the 14th century,

651
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,315
and, if caught,
they do become property of the Crown.

652
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,079
So, yes, we're treating the matter as suspicious.

653
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,671
How deep is the ocean?

654
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:22,272
Seven miles at its deepest point,
but on average, six miles as a rule of thumb.

655
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,311
But no fish could live down there.

656
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:28,116
There's no light, of course,
and the pressure is far too great.

657
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,674
Any human who found themselves at that level,

658
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,631
well, they would die immediately.

659
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:35,433
They would implode.
They wouldn't stand a chance.

660
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,391
But in answer to your question,

661
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,795
the ocean is six miles deep.

662
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,517
I am a prism.

663
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,871
That's not mad.

664
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,918
OK? I am a prism, I am light.

665
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,511
I am lucid.

666
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:55,355
I am exciting and delicious.

667
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,995
Thanks very much for today.
You've been fantastic.

668
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,668
Well done.

669
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,475
- It seemed to go pretty well.
- Oh, yes, yes.

670
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,431
I think they...

671
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,948
- They loved it.
- Did you enjoy it?

672
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,592
Absolutely.

673
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,392
A lot to take in.

674
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,751
- But it was silly, right?
- No, no.

675
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,756
- You think I'm silly?
- No, I don't.

676
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,268
- It's OK.
- I don't. I don't.

677
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,591
I didn't ask for this, Jill.

678
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,511
This gift, it's... It's like a burden to me.

679
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:37,915
Sure.

680
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,235
Yeah, you must be exhausted.

681
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,351
I split up with Kim-Lin.

682
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,836
Oh, no. Oh, dear.

683
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,711
Let her go.

684
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:51,035
- She was young, right?
- I'm really sorry.

685
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,992
- It's all good.
- Anyway, I'd better... I'd better go.

686
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,996
- Gonna come next week?
- Er...

687
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,236
- I can?
- You'd better.

688
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,035
Sure. I'll check my diary.

689
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,674
- Bring Lloyd.
- Um...

690
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,631
OK. I don't think it's really...

691
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,438
...his cup of... I'll ask.

692
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,791
If you ask him...

693
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,751
he will come.

694
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,191
- I'll see what I can do.
- Right.

695
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,359
- Thank you again. You're very good.
- Ciao, Jill.

696
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,277
- Watch yourself.
- Thank you.

697
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,071
Bye-bye.

698
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,471
I'm watching you.

699
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,434
<i>And by being in balance</i>
<i>with the colours around them,</i>

700
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,110
<i>with a healthy colour glow around themselves,</i>

701
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,071
<i>they're living a fulfilled life</i>.

702
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:52,319
<i>So when you're in a crisis, it doesn't</i>
<i>feel like the waves are crashing on you,</i>

703
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:55,955
<i>it feels like you can just stand</i>
<i>under those waves</i>

704
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,311
<i>and let them do their business,</i>

705
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:03,354
<i>and then get a towel and bloody dry yourself off,</i>
<i>and go about your day</i>.

706
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,753
<i>That's what it means</i>.

707
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,599
<i>My mum is the exact type of person</i>

708
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,474
<i>who is susceptible to this mystic bullshit</i>.

709
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,317
<i>I can picture her telling Jackie at work</i>

710
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,588
<i>how it's a bit over the top</i>

711
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,198
<i>but there's something in it</i>.

712
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,151
<i>If my dad radiated a colour,</i>

713
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,156
<i>it'd be ochre or eggshell</i>.

714
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,878
<i>He knows the number for the pothole</i>
<i>helpline off by heart</i>.

715
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:25,198
It's about a foot in diameter.
It's a bit of a concern.

716
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,749
Pothole.

717
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,998
Yes, that's right, Lloyd Tate.
Oh, hi, how are you?

718
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:33,589
<i>He was the first person in our village</i>
<i>to install double glazing</i>.

719
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,389
It's from Dad.

720
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,751
<i>He ruins every Christmas</i>.

721
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,711
It's a kettle.

722
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,435
Great.

723
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:46,189
...<i>how extraordinary they are</i>.

724
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,511
<i>Because they've forgotten, right?</i>

725
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,114
<i>Maybe it's time for Dad</i>
<i>to rip off his vest again</i>.

726
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,791
I mean, it's a bit over the top,
but I think there's something in it.

727
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,558
Yes, yes. Good turnout, was it?

728
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,113
I'm going out for a bit.

729
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,955
<i>The question was, do I tell Jordana</i>
<i>about this Graham situation?</i>

730
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,311
<i>I mean, we'd had sex</i>.

731
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:08,113
<i>Wouldn't it spoil things</i>
<i>if I suddenly got emotional?</i>

732
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,713
<i>I decided to soften the blow</i>
<i>with some light arson</i>.

733
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,470
You don't talk about your parents much.

734
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:24,799
- I mean, do they get on?
- Yeah, they get on.

735
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:28,799
Mine get on as well. It's good, isn't it?
It's important that they get on.

736
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,434
So everything's fine at home,
everything's OK?

737
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,436
Cos everything's fine with me.

738
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,316
Actually, my mum's not well at the moment.

739
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,478
They get on, you know.

740
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,033
That's the main thing.

741
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:41,675
Yeah.

742
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,990
Sorry, did you say your mum wasn't well?

743
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:47,270
Yeah.

744
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,391
Why, what's wrong?

745
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,111
She's got...

746
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:56,472
it's called... medulloblastoma.

747
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,232
What does it mean?

748
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,191
It means she's got a brain tumour.

749
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,153
Oh, no.

750
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,469
<i>Confiding in Jordana was now impossible</i>.

751
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,918
<i>Her mother had cancer</i>.

752
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:23,751
<i>And in the Top Trumps of parental problems,</i>
<i>cancer beats potential infidelity</i>.

753
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,229
<i>I would have to travel this road secretly,</i>

754
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,398
<i>unaided,</i>

755
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,237
<i>a renegade,</i>

756
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,111
<i>a solitary samurai</i>.

757
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,920
<i>Things were a lot less fun since</i>
<i>Jordana's mother might die</i>

758
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:11,033
<i>and my parents' marriage</i>
<i>started falling apart</i>.

759
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:13,719
<i>I've been working on strategies</i>
<i>to solve both problems</i>.

760
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,150
<i>I bought my dad some new aftershave,</i>
<i>but I'm drawing a blank on the cancer</i>.

761
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,757
<i>You're fucked. Even if her mum</i>
<i>is terminal, it can still take ages</i>.

762
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,519
<i>Please, Chip, shut up</i>.

763
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,357
This is not what you signed up for.

764
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,233
This is about dipping your wick.
You've done that, game over.

765
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,396
She'll be in no mood to put out any more.

766
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,919
No more Yuletide logging for you,

767
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,191
unlike me, who shall be rolling in it
throughout the festive period.

768
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,231
Do you actually pre-prepare these lines?

769
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,191
I just split lines as they come to me.

770
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,038
You've got to shut the shit down.
Keiron, get my back.

771
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,957
- With extreme prejudice.
- Thank you.

772
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,197
- Nothing's changed.
- Do what you want. Remember two things:

773
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,117
One - treat 'em mean, keep 'em keen.

774
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,071
Two - don't mix family and bush.

775
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:57,271
Get the fuck out of here.
Merry Christmas. Have a good 'un.

776
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,393
You all right?

777
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:03,071
You've gotta shut this shit down.
It's fucking ridiculous.

778
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,871
Glass In The Park

779
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,148
# If there's glass in the park

780
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:23,433
# Darling, I can't help but keep

781
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:27,953
# Making appointments to sweep

782
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,075
# Beneath the climbing frame

783
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:37,035
# If the sun's in your eyes

784
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:41,673
# I'll tighten your blindfold, baby

785
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:46,358
# Don't worry, your foot won't get cut

786
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,156
# Strut carelessly

787
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,519
<i>I've been taking my duty as a boyfriend</i>
<i>seriously</i>.

788
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,758
<i>Last night, I reread the book</i>
<i>I Only Want What's Best For You</i>.

789
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:11,036
<i>It's therefore in Jordana's interest</i>
<i>that her dog dies before her mother does</i>.

790
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,391
<i>Then we can get things back on track</i>.

791
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,997
Oliver Tate.

792
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,351
OK, calm down.

793
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,833
What happened?

794
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,390
<i>There was no need to poison Jordana's dog</i>

795
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:33,354
<i>because Jordana's dog</i>
<i>had just been hit by a train</i>.

796
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,278
<i>I scraped his remains</i>
<i>into the bin liner I'd brought</i>.

797
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,790
<i>The death of a pet makes it easier</i>
<i>to accept the death of a parent</i>.

798
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:43,355
<i>I could feel the tension between Jordana and I</i>
<i>start to slip away</i>.

799
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,355
Oh!

800
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,995
No, of course, I'm sorry. I just...

801
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,951
I thought...

802
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,551
We should bury him.

803
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,518
No, I don't think we should.

804
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,030
Foxes dig up dead animals and eat them.

805
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,831
What should we do, then?

806
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,919
Well, there's this thing the Vikings used to do.

807
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,351
Jude would like to meet you.

808
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,518
- Who's Jude?
- My mum.

809
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:33,357
Since when have you called her Jude?

810
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,317
Since she might die in two weeks.

811
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:36,588
Right.

812
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,111
So, do you wanna come?

813
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:47,190
<i>The Bevans had Christmas dinner early</i>
<i>in case it was the last one they had</i>.

814
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,870
<i>I hoped it wouldn't be,</i>
<i>cos the turkey was quite dry</i>

815
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,480
<i>and the spouts had turned mushy</i>
<i>and out of focus</i>.

816
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:53,873
This is crackin', love.

817
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,638
Yeah, it's great. Thank you, Mrs Bevan.

818
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,113
This is my last warning.

819
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,149
It's Jude.

820
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:01,510
So, I hear from my little girl
that you've stolen her heart.

821
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:02,310
Dad...

822
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,999
Let me tell you,
if you're lucky enough to find an angel,

823
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,829
hold onto her with everything you've got.

824
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:13,271
Oh, these fucking lights!

825
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,191
Cheap shit.

826
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,631
Oh, come on.

827
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:28,235
You're acting like I'm dead already.

828
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,033
Come on.

829
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,355
It'd take more than
some silly tumour to kill me.

830
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,960
- It might not.
- Oh, come on, now. Don't be daft.

831
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,991
- Sorry.
- All right.

832
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:41,471
Oh, it's all right, darling. Ssh.

833
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,194
- Come here.
- Sorry, love.

834
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:45,914
Are you all right? Come on.

835
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,632
- Come on.
- Sorry, sorry.

836
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:48,351
Sorry.

837
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,435
- All right?
- Yeah.

838
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:51,516
I'm fine. I'm fine. Give us a cudge.

839
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,638
Listen... Thank you.

840
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:55,752
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

841
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:59,076
Thank you for looking after Jordana,
for walking through the fire with her.

842
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,792
- Thank you. Appreciate it.
- No.

843
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,070
- No, we both do.
- He's a good boy, isn't he?

844
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,678
Part of the family now. Deal?

845
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,073
- Deal?
- Deal.

846
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,473
Family, deal.

847
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:08,748
Deal, yes?

848
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,756
There we fucking go.

849
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:33,073
Maybe you should come to the hospital
this Friday.

850
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:37,238
Mum will have had her operation by then
and we can visit.

851
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,956
- If you felt like it.
- Er, Friday.

852
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,998
I've got to do some Christmas shopping.

853
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,919
- What?
- I always leave it too late.

854
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,269
- I want to get you something good.
- Mother might die.

855
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,435
- I know.
- Do you care,

856
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,516
- or couldn't you give a fuck?
- I do, clearly.

857
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,073
I'll come. When is it?

858
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:53,792
Friday.

859
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,319
Great, yeah.

860
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:00,514
Yeah, Friday's good for me, actually.
Yeah, I can do that. Excellent.

861
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,676
Your skin's better. You're allergic to the dog.

862
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,598
I'm eating better.

863
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,519
Following Mum's special diet.

864
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:08,516
Is that because of the...

865
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:10,471
We eat lots of ginger now.

866
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:12,431
So, Friday.

867
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:14,398
The visiting hours are six till eight.

868
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:15,909
Got it. Six till eight.

869
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,678
I'll meet you there.

870
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,597
OK.

871
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:22,108
I'm sorry I'm like this.

872
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,720
- I dunno. I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine.

873
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:28,719
- Don't think you have to wait. It's cold.
- No, it's fine. I'll wait.

874
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,432
I've got you these matches.

875
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,391
Your favourite.

876
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,038
I noticed the way you light a match.

877
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:37,914
The flame is the same shape
as a falling tear.

878
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,471
<i>I knew then it was too late to save her</i>.

879
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,316
<i>She'd gone gooey in the middle</i>.

880
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,797
<i>From now on she'll buy little gifts</i>
<i>for her favourite teachers</i>

881
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:50,037
<i>and she'll admire the scenery</i>
<i>and she'll buy soup for homeless people</i>.

882
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,549
<i>And she'll never burn my leg here again</i>.

883
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,995
- Maybe I will go. It's pretty cold.
- Yeah.

884
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,396
OK.

885
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,191
Good night.

886
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:29,156
<i>When I discovered</i>
<i>I could see these colours in people,</i>

887
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:32,717
<i>it took a long time because I was</i>
<i>in such a state of anxiety</i>.

888
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:37,151
<i>It was when I started to be comfortable with it</i>
<i>and stopped trying to resist it,</i>

889
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,111
<i>it started to nourish me</i>.

890
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,594
<i>And I could relax around it and be in it</i>.

891
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:45,110
<i>Then I started to make</i>
<i>more of an understanding of it</i>.

892
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,109
Well, it's um...

893
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,471
It's interesting.

894
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,234
He's really working that third eye, isn't he?

895
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:01,315
It's just a metaphor, Lloyd.

896
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,796
Oh, no, no, no. I mean, it's good, yes.

897
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,795
I like the whole colour coding thing.

898
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:10,277
Well, I'd like to go again.

899
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,231
I'd like you to be there, so...

900
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:17,229
- You want us to go?
- Yes, I do.

901
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,393
Right.

902
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,478
Do I have to bring shorts?

903
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:25,394
- It's on this Friday, so...
- Right, OK, yeah.

904
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,951
What, are you coming or...

905
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,677
Well, I'm intrigued, yeah.

906
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,315
- For sure.
- This Friday. This Friday.

907
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,475
- This Friday?
- Mm-hm.

908
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,317
OK, yep, yep.

909
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:42,190
- Thank you.
- Mm.

910
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,558
Don't let me down. OK?

911
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,231
<i>The most fantastical way</i>
<i>people experience the Graham TPurvis system</i>

912
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,599
<i>is to come to the seminar</i>.

913
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:51,551
Oliver, what are you doing?

914
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:55,115
...<i>have been mind-blowing</i>.
<i>I've seen lives change</i>.

915
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:57,471
<i>It's just incredible</i>.

916
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:03,511
<i>I wish on a global scale</i>
<i>that people could get the message</i>.

917
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,679
<i>Wouldn't it be just wonderful?</i>

918
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,238
Friday...

919
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,750
I'll be OK. I'll be...

920
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,553
I'll be fine. I'll be all right.

921
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:17,511
Yeah, I'll be OK.

922
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,312
Yeah.

923
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:55,391
You should go in.

924
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:00,751
Dad, aren't you going to Graham's thing?

925
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,839
- Hm?
- Graham's thing. It's Friday.

926
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,711
I thought you were going out.

927
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,910
Yeah, I'm meant to be at the hospital.

928
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:10,633
Well, you should get along then, I suppose.

929
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,796
Yeah. Yeah, I will. Yeah, I should go.

930
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:20,191
Right, I'm off out.

931
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,870
I'll see you, then.

932
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:26,639
Bye.

933
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:33,110
Dad, who would you save first in a house fire,

934
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,039
given the hypothetical situation

935
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:37,355
that both Mum and I
were equally difficult to save?

936
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:38,628
I'd save your mother first,

937
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:42,195
so we had a better chance
of working together to save you.

938
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,750
Do you often feel like this?

939
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:59,428
Like what?

940
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:02,438
- Tired?
- Down in the dumps.

941
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:06,035
Quite often.

942
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,391
How long for?

943
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,389
Since I was about your age, I suppose.

944
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:13,751
What does it feel like?

945
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:17,871
Like being underwater.

946
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,438
Is that why you became a marine biologist?

947
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:23,757
Maybe, yeah.

948
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:25,711
Have you always liked fish?

949
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,391
I suppose so.

950
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:32,550
I just sort of drifted into it, really.
No pun intended.

951
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,911
And does Mum mind?

952
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:37,677
I think she'd rather I earnt more money.

953
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:40,031
No, you being underwater.

954
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:41,069
Oh.

955
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:42,712
Yeah, no.

956
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:45,035
I'm sure she'd rather I wasn't.

957
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:47,594
It's not very pleasant.

958
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:50,116
The ocean is six miles deep, isn't it?

959
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:54,431
Well remembered. Yeah.

960
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:01,232
Could be Mum.

961
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,191
Or Jordana.

962
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:45,753
<i>I haven't spoken to Jordana about her mother</i>
<i>because there's only two possible outcomes</i>.

963
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:47,918
<i>Either the operation was a success,</i>

964
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:50,872
<i>in which case she'll be too relieved</i>
<i>to be angry with me for long,</i>

965
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:52,114
<i>or her mother was dead,</i>

966
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:54,958
<i>in which case she needs privacy</i>
<i>and time to grieve</i>.

967
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:58,678
<i>During this brief hiatus,</i>
<i>I can help save my parents' marriage</i>

968
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:02,317
<i>and then resume my duties</i>
<i>as the best boyfriend in the world</i>.

969
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,151
Oliver.

970
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:29,635
Yes?

971
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,274
- What's this?
- I don't know.

972
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:32,594
- What is this?
- A letter.

973
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:34,517
- I don't know what's in it.
- I think you do.

974
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:36,471
Why did you write this, Oliver?

975
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,319
This isn't funny.

976
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:41,149
If I did write it, and I'm not as yet
admitting that I did,

977
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,395
it'd be because I spoke to Dad.
This is what he wants.

978
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:46,034
- You spoke to Dad?
- He knows he's been imperfect.

979
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:47,718
What did you talk about, Oliver?

980
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,671
Listen,

981
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:51,599
he still finds you attractive.

982
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:53,951
He still wants to make love to you.

983
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:56,468
Are you making this up?

984
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:00,071
Me and Dad have discussed it.
We both want to make this marriage work.

985
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:01,712
Are you with us?

986
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:48,273
<i>Going to the beach with Graham</i>.
<i>I will not be back tonight</i>.

987
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:22,397
<i>On New Year's Eve,</i>
<i>everyone from town goes to the beach</i>.

988
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:25,434
<i>Chip said, if a girl won't get off with you</i>
<i>on New Year's Eve,</i>

989
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:26,959
<i>you may as well cut it off</i>.

990
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,389
<i>I'm starting to think that we may grow apart</i>.

991
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:31,358
<i>I don't want a mystic ninja as a stepdad</i>.

992
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:33,916
<i>I don't want to be from a broken home</i>
<i>like Chip's,</i>

993
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:38,397
<i>wearing tracksuit tops instead of coats</i>
<i>and taking gateway drugs in shopping malls</i>.

994
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:40,112
<i>I want my family back</i>.

995
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:42,071
<i>I don't want anything to change</i>.

996
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:37,510
The celebrations are really kicking in, right?

997
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:38,879
Yeah.

998
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:40,831
It distresses tiny animals.

999
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,159
- You can relax, right?
- Mm.

1000
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:46,068
- There's some lovely massage oils.
- Great. OK.

1001
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:47,519
In you get.

1002
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:49,471
All right.

1003
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:38,916
<i>I have no idea what I'm hoping to achieve</i>
<i>by breaking into Graham's house</i>.

1004
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:41,430
<i>I just want to give him</i>
<i>the idea that I'm deranged</i>

1005
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:43,516
<i>and therefore capable of anything</i>.

1006
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:46,552
<i>This will probably involve me urinating</i>
<i>or something</i>.

1007
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:54,556
I need a fucking drink.

1008
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:01,352
I'm doing it. Just do it.

1009
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:03,072
Just do it...

1010
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,235
Just do it.

1011
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:15,555
OK.

1012
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,399
Feel my piss.

1013
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:19,631
Oh, come on.

1014
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:21,991
Come on.

1015
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:25,070
Oh, for fuck...

1016
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,431
Fuck.

1017
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:28,834
It's fine.

1018
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:31,191
Come on. Just...

1019
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:37,434
Fucking piss on your face, you fucking freak.

1020
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:42,431
For fuck's sake, just come on. Loosen up.

1021
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:51,551
Oh, here we go.

1022
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:55,634
OK, that'll do it.

1023
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:02,673
Jesus Christ.

1024
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:07,999
Fuck.

1025
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:31,951
Kim-Lin?

1026
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,911
Is that you?

1027
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:38,951
Do you still have a key?

1028
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:42,111
That's very naughty.

1029
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,711
Oh, this is fun, isn't it?

1030
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:52,391
What kind of protest's this, then, eh?

1031
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,273
Huh?

1032
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:59,076
How much more of this bizarre behaviour
do I have to endure?

1033
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:12,032
Nearly went red there.

1034
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:14,630
Come on, up you get, sweetheart.

1035
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:16,591
I'm just try...

1036
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:22,237
My name is not Kim-Lin.

1037
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:25,194
My name is Oliver Tate.

1038
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:31,989
Hello.

1039
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:35,391
Hello.

1040
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,471
Hello!

1041
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:48,831
Knock, knock.

1042
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,118
How are you feeling?

1043
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,471
I saw Mum with Graham at the beach.

1044
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:56,431
Mm. Mum told me everything.

1045
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:59,029
Did she say she went into the van
with his face on it?

1046
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:00,356
Yes.

1047
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,789
Did she say what happened in the van
with his face on it?

1048
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:03,909
Yes.

1049
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:05,598
Aren't you angry?

1050
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:07,551
Worse things have happened at sea, OI.

1051
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:10,154
- What did happen?
- That's between your mother and I.

1052
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,191
Lloyd, I think it best we be honest.

1053
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:13,593
Sweet pea,

1054
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:15,551
I gave Graham a handjob.

1055
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:19,760
Is there anything you'd like to say about that?

1056
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:22,431
- Lloyd, do you want to add anything?
- No.

1057
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:27,192
OK. Well, I was drunk
and I was trying to relax Graham.

1058
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:29,708
- It was a silly thing to do.
- Mm.

1059
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:31,074
Thank you.

1060
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:33,431
Your father and I have discussed it

1061
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:37,839
and if it's OK with everyone,
that's the last we'll say about it.

1062
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:40,191
OK? Thank you.

1063
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:43,909
Is there anything
you'd like to talk about now, huh?

1064
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:48,153
Me and Jordana
are having relationship problems.

1065
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,989
- Oh.
- It's difficult.

1066
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:53,429
I suppose it won't matter when I'm 38 but...

1067
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:54,799
I'm upset about it.

1068
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:56,558
You should be more angry with her.

1069
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:58,511
Why would I be angry with Jordana?

1070
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:00,354
Oh, you mean me.

1071
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,392
Yes. No, no. Well, you know, I am.

1072
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:04,351
Yeah, I'm upset.

1073
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:08,110
We should go back to sleep, though.

1074
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:10,073
Yeah.

1075
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:13,669
We're not going to punish you now
but we're going to talk about what you've done.

1076
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:15,039
What about what you've done?

1077
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:16,513
OK, don't push it, OI.

1078
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,757
Well, we'll talk about that too
but you should go back to sleep now, OK?

1079
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:22,109
- OK.
- Mm?

1080
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:25,711
Right.

1081
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:59,477
<i>Dear Oliver, I tried to tell you</i>

1082
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:03,276
<i>but I figure you'll only probably believe me</i>
<i>if it's in writing. It's over</i>.

1083
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:05,311
I enclose my lighter as a parting gift for you.

1084
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:07,715
Also, I think you should know,
I've found someone else.

1085
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:09,990
When we're in school together,
try not to look upset.

1086
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:12,076
I know you're a good actor.

1087
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:16,193
You were right about
my being allergic to dogs. I got tested.

1088
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:18,993
Oh, and in case you're interested,
my mum's fine now.

1089
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,190
Sorry if it made you feel awkward.

1090
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:30,394
It's Hard To Get Around The Wind

1091
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:36,996
# It's like you're trying to get to heaven
in a hurry

1092
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:40,352
# And the queue was shorter
than you thought it'd be

1093
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:45,713
# And the doorman says,
You need to get a wrist band

1094
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:49,430
# You got a lift between the pitfalls

1095
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:53,111
# But you're looking like you're low on energy

1096
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:58,473
# Did you get out and walk
to ensure you'd miss the quicksand?

1097
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:00,997
Could you tell her I called?

1098
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:04,557
# Looking for a new place to begin
- It's Oliver. Oliver Tate.

1099
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:06,991
Oh, yeah, she's got my number.

1100
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:11,035
# Feeling like it's hard to understand

1101
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:18,196
# But as long as you still keep peppering the pill

1102
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:23,515
# You'll find a way to spit it out again

1103
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:30,916
# And even when you know
the way it's gonna blow

1104
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:39,313
# It's hard to get around the wind

1105
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:41,671
<i>None of this will matter when I'm 38</i>.

1106
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:44,992
<i>But it's been two months</i>
<i>since Jordana last spoke to me</i>.

1107
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,190
<i>Her new boyfriend has an incredibly long neck</i>.

1108
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:52,314
<i>Just thinking about giraffes makes me angry</i>.

1109
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:55,717
<i>I wish I could hand in this excuse note</i>.

1110
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:57,354
"Dear Mr Davey,

1111
01:15:57,400 --> 01:16:00,392
Please may Oliver be excused from class.
His tiny heart is broken.

1112
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:02,351
Yours sincerely, Lloyd Tate."

1113
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:05,235
# Stretching out the neck on your evening

1114
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:08,793
# Trying to even out some deficit

1115
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:14,519
# But it's sabre-toothed, multi-ball confusion

1116
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:18,875
# And you can shriek until you're hollow

1117
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:22,312
# Or whisper it the other way

1118
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:27,434
# Trying to save the youth
without putting your shoes on

1119
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:33,559
# Looking for a new place to begin

1120
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:39,989
- Is he all right?
- He's fine. Just leave him.

1121
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:47,273
# As long as you still keep peppering the pill

1122
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:52,635
# You'll find a way to spit it out again

1123
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:59,917
# And even when you know
the way it's gonna blow

1124
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:05,433
# It's hard

1125
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:10,431
# To get around the wind

1126
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:14,634
<i>In my other recurring dream,</i>
<i>I mentally rehearse the end scene</i>.

1127
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:18,038
<i>The one where it's getting dark</i>
<i>and I mistake a girl for Jordana</i>.

1128
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:21,277
<i>A girl with the exact same frame</i>
<i>and the exact same hair</i>.

1129
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:24,392
<i>And when she turns around,</i>
<i>I see her face is nothing like Jordana's</i>.

1130
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:26,590
<i>And she asks, "Do I know you?"</i>

1131
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:28,392
<i>And I look traumatised and say</i>...

1132
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:30,112
<i>No</i>.

1133
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:31,878
<i>You don't know me</i>.

1134
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:33,876
<i>You don't know me at all</i>.

1135
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,468
I think this will matter when I'm older,
when I'm 38.

1136
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:39,239
Don't you knock any more?

1137
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:40,269
Sorry, Oliver. What?

1138
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,675
Jordana... I think it will matter when I'm older.

1139
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:44,153
Yeah, course it will.

1140
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:46,156
OK, well... Good night.

1141
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:53,956
# And I can hear you through my window

1142
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:57,517
# But I'm never quite sure who is who

1143
01:17:57,560 --> 01:18:02,839
# But they want the world on a dessert spoon

1144
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:06,752
# It always sounds like they're fighting

1145
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:10,795
# Or as if that's what they're about to do

1146
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:12,831
# It might not hurt now

1147
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:16,111
# But it's gonna hurt soon

1148
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:28,751
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1149
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:32,840
You've got to be shitting me.

1150
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:33,996
Pritchard.

1151
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:36,395
Pritchard, take a look at this.
It's as funny as fuck.

1152
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:38,635
All right, whose note is that?

1153
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:45,879
It's mine.

1154
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:49,712
Thank you, Oliver, for your refreshing honesty.

1155
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:52,276
But you know the rules.
Up you come, read it out.

1156
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:37,878
It was just a joke?

1157
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:39,469
Yeah.

1158
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:42,398
OK, well, as I say,
if it was just a joke then that's fine.

1159
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:45,352
But if ever you have serious feelings

1160
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:48,631
of, you know, difficulty

1161
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:49,999
or sadness

1162
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:53,350
or any negative feelings that you want
to talk about, feel free to come and...

1163
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:54,628
I know, I know, yeah.

1164
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:56,033
I can talk to you about that.

1165
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:57,672
OK. I don't want to embarrass you

1166
01:19:57,720 --> 01:20:01,679
but I just wanted you to know that
I'm open to talking whenever you want.

1167
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:02,914
Yeah. OK.

1168
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:03,870
Cool.

1169
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:05,353
Good.

1170
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,789
Nice one, OI. Nice one, you fuck-muppet.

1171
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:10,798
Why write stuff like that?
Perhaps people are right and you are gay.

1172
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:13,877
"Jordana, I love you. I want to
have your babies, get married."

1173
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:15,035
What the fuck?

1174
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:18,675
- Fuck you, Chips.
- What the fuck are you up to, you fool?

1175
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:33,755
What?

1176
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:35,918
- You're a loser.
- Go and see the girl

1177
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:37,791
- who doesn't like you.
- I'll be back.

1178
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:39,398
I'll hit you in the face.

1179
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:46,078
Can I have a word, please, in private,
without him?

1180
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:47,874
I'm fine here.

1181
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:50,312
Sorry I didn't come to the hospital.

1182
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:52,478
I thought my parents were going to split up

1183
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:54,670
and I didn't want to look weak
or things to change.

1184
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:56,995
My mum gave a hand-job to a mystic.

1185
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:01,791
Look, I was frightened.

1186
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:04,032
I'm full of regret.

1187
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:12,988
This is the moment where you leave him
and come with me.

1188
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:18,958
Is it?

1189
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:21,277
Yeah.

1190
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:23,231
Are you coming?

1191
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:27,511
No.

1192
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:39,198
<i>I don't know if I've come of age</i>
<i>but I'm certainly older now</i>.

1193
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:43,189
<i>I feel shrunken, as if there's</i>
<i>a tiny ancient Oliver Tate inside me</i>

1194
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:45,993
<i>operating the levers of</i>
<i>a life-size Oliver-shaped shell</i>.

1195
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:48,235
<i>A shell on which a decrepit picture show</i>

1196
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:50,191
<i>replays the same handful of images</i>.

1197
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:10,113
<i>Every night I come to the same place</i>
<i>and wait till the sky catches up with my mood</i>.

1198
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:13,273
<i>The pattern is set</i>.

1199
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:16,951
<i>This is, no doubt, the end</i>.

1200
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:33,835
Jordana!

1201
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:44,078
Jordana!

1202
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:49,071
It is you.

1203
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:51,636
I didn't think it'd be you. I...

1204
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:55,511
I thought it'd be like a film
where the girl turns round and it's not the...

1205
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:57,552
You've got a new dog. You're allergic.

1206
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,158
- Oliver.
- Where's your boyfriend?

1207
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:00,553
He's not my boyfriend.

1208
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:03,319
Your skin's looking bad, terrible.
It's probably the dog.

1209
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:05,191
I don't care about my fucking skin.

1210
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:08,312
- Why on earth did you get a new dog?
- Because I like dogs, OK?

1211
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:09,998
Why are you such a total dick?

1212
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:11,951
I don't know.

1213
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:15,074
I was crying earlier. My eyes are probably red.

1214
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:16,555
They look fine.

1215
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:18,750
No, well, maybe they don't go red when I cry.

1216
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:20,711
It happens to some.

1217
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:24,672
You were horrible to me.

1218
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:29,149
I know. I made a mistake.

1219
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:32,034
I made a mistake.
What do you want me to say?

1220
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:38,152
- Ask me how deep the ocean is.
- Shut up.

1221
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:39,715
Go on, just ask me.

1222
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:41,239
- Why?
- Because I know the answer.

1223
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:43,032
- Oh, do you?
- Yeah. I do.

1224
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:44,559
- How deep?
- I'm not going to say.

1225
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:46,511
I'm broken-hearted.

1226
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:49,231
- The ocean is six miles deep.
- Good.

Piledriver Waltz

1228
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:56,877

1229
01:26:57,320 --> 01:27:00,517
# On the back of a raindrop

1230
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:03,199

1232
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,992

1251
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:14,557

01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:49,709
# I'm not the kind of fool

# The dark half of the blue

1273
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:08,070

1275
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:13,995
