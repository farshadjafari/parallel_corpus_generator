1
00:00:57,256 --> 00:00:59,225
Dario!

2
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:01,226
A message from Peligro.

3
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:10,265
Ho!

4
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:35,385
Mambo, Mambo, Mambo, Mambo

5
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:38,263
Mambo, Mambo, Mambo, Mambo

6
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:41,324
Mambo, Mambo, Mambo, Mambo

7
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:43,325
Mambo, Mambo, Mambo, Mambo

8
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:48,298
Mambo, Mambo, Mambo, Mambo

9
00:02:57,342 --> 00:02:59,311
Mambo, Mambo, Mambo, Mambo

10
00:02:59,444 --> 00:03:06,342
Mambo, Mambo, Mambo, Mambo

11
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,324
Mambo

12
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:24,461
Ladies and gentlemen,

13
00:03:24,503 --> 00:03:27,301
a very good evening to you all.

14
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,397
El Tropico,

15
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:32,241
the most fabulous nightclub in
the world, presents

16
00:03:32,277 --> 00:03:35,247
its latest,
but not late show,

17
00:03:35,247 --> 00:03:37,306
where we are taking you all
to the magical productions

18
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:40,318
of our Rodney the Great.

19
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:44,412
Ladies and gentlemen,

20
00:03:44,456 --> 00:03:46,425
we are honored tonight
to have in our presence

21
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:49,228
the world's greatest
living race car driver,

22
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:51,522
here in Cuba for the first
Havana Grand Prix.

23
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:53,354
Ladies and gentlemen,

24
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:56,493
the one and only Fangio
for once, stationary.

25
00:03:56,536 --> 00:04:00,403
Fangio! Fangio!
Fangio! Fangio!

26
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,340
Fangio!

27
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,343
And now, a special treat

28
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,479
for a very special couple.

29
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:09,343
Forever newlyweds,

30
00:04:09,348 --> 00:04:12,443
Dona Cecilia, Don Federico,

31
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,378
The Anniversary waltz
by Strauss.

32
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,447
Happy Anniversary.

33
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:26,526
A toast.

34
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,290
To the most
elegant couple in Havana.

35
00:04:29,334 --> 00:04:30,266
Happy Anniversary.

36
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,358
And to this,

37
00:04:31,403 --> 00:04:33,372
the happiest of families.

38
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:35,374
May it be that way forever.

39
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,343
Hear, hear. Salud.

40
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:38,502
Salud.
Salud.

41
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,507
Dance with me,
as you once did?

42
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:46,279
You make me
sound like a relic.

43
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:49,377
My relic.

44
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:52,483
Donoso, would you
dance with me?

45
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,281
Watch yourself.

46
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:56,290
Uncle has two left feet now.

47
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:57,454
His elbow,
it works fine.

48
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:01,422
I would give an arm
and a leg and an elbow

49
00:05:01,466 --> 00:05:04,300
for just one single waltz.

50
00:05:04,336 --> 00:05:09,297
My kingdom for a cha-cha-cha!

51
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:10,309
Hear, hear.

52
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,435
Let's go dance.

53
00:05:13,512 --> 00:05:16,482
I'll be right back. Wait here.

54
00:05:24,456 --> 00:05:25,446
What's wrong?

55
00:05:27,492 --> 00:05:30,326
So which one
of those dancers

56
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:31,387
is your girlfriend
this week?

57
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,324
Who are you
saving yourself for?

58
00:05:36,435 --> 00:05:38,300
No one.

59
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,396
All the good ones
are already spoken for.

60
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:43,375
Fangio, I want to present to you

61
00:05:43,408 --> 00:05:45,377
my wife Mercedes Fellove.

62
00:05:54,286 --> 00:05:55,413
Come on, let's go.

63
00:05:59,524 --> 00:06:04,291
This meeting was my idea...

64
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:08,495
because these are very
difficult times, as you know.

65
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,435
Cuba has always
lived in difficult times,

66
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,439
but through them all,
we have been able to survive

67
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:18,307
because we have
always been united.

68
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:21,302
But our country
isn't safe anymore,

69
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:24,476
and it threatens us.

70
00:06:24,516 --> 00:06:30,285
Your uncle and I are all
that remains of our generation.

71
00:06:32,324 --> 00:06:37,524
So, my sons,
you are the future.

72
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:40,293
The future of our family.

73
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:42,297
The future of this island.

74
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:46,338
Yes, and
look at me.

75
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:48,305
Look at me, because
this is for you, too.

76
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,307
If we want to
change the status quo,

77
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:55,370
we must go about it
in a democratic way.

78
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,507
You hear?

79
00:06:56,548 --> 00:06:58,483
We must be patriots.

80
00:06:58,483 --> 00:06:59,451
Patriots.

81
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,413
Patriotism is a refuge for scoundrels.

82
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,252
Do you

83
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,348
It is politics
that has become

84
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,358
the practical refuge of

85
00:07:07,392 --> 00:07:08,519
Papi, do not make the mistake

86
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,358
of confusing me for
one of your students.

87
00:07:10,362 --> 00:07:11,329
I'm not. I graduated.

88
00:07:11,363 --> 00:07:12,331
Hey.

89
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:15,300
Show a little respect.

90
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:17,427
No, no, no, no.
Let him talk.

91
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,303
Let him talk.
This is a democracy.

92
00:07:20,338 --> 00:07:23,274
Oh, this country,
a democracy? Right.

93
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,403
Our family is a democracy.

94
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:27,413
This country is my family,

95
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:30,382
and the only way
to truly unite that family

96
00:07:30,415 --> 00:07:31,473
is revolution.

97
00:07:31,516 --> 00:07:32,483
Revolution?

98
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,286
Revolution, yes.

99
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,411
I just can't believe it.

100
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:39,357
A son of mine
that would support

101
00:07:39,391 --> 00:07:41,519
the random violence
of revolution?

102
00:07:41,526 --> 00:07:43,427
You better start believing it.

103
00:07:43,528 --> 00:07:46,362
What you need is
a little evolution,

104
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:47,331
not revolution.

105
00:07:47,365 --> 00:07:48,458
Correct.

106
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,401
The poet.

107
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,233
Club owner, poet.

108
00:07:52,404 --> 00:07:54,372
You're lucky you're on
the other side of the room.

109
00:07:54,372 --> 00:07:55,339
I feel lucky,

110
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:57,309
because it probably
stinks on that side of the room.

111
00:07:57,442 --> 00:07:58,273
Please.

112
00:07:58,444 --> 00:07:59,274
Happy Anniversary.

113
00:07:59,444 --> 00:08:00,411
You are too much.

114
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:02,276
Did I forget to say that?
Happy Anniversary?

115
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:03,406
Just watch your mouth.

116
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:05,507
What? You've been watching it
the whole time.

117
00:08:05,517 --> 00:08:07,485
If I hear one more
word of disrespect

118
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:09,317
coming out of your mouth,

119
00:08:09,454 --> 00:08:11,514
I'm gonna
deal with it personally.

120
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:13,321
Do you understand me?

121
00:08:13,358 --> 00:08:14,290
What?

122
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:16,257
You understand
what I just said to you?

123
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:17,262
I understand

124
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:19,329
You listen to your father
when he's speaking to you,

125
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:20,490
and you show respect!

126
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,432
Calm down, Fico.

127
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:22,401
No, you calm down!

128
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:24,427
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

129
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,427
You want me
to come over there?

130
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,406
Okay.

131
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:29,271
Huh? You want me
to come over there?

132
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,232
Stop it!

133
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:33,471
Come on.
Come on.

134
00:08:35,447 --> 00:08:38,280
Stop it!
Stop it.

135
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:40,443
Four against one, huh?
Stop it.

136
00:08:40,452 --> 00:08:41,419
Sit down.
Sit down.

137
00:08:41,453 --> 00:08:42,421
Is this a democracy?

138
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:43,422
Sit down.

139
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:45,423
You got your little show.
Sit down.

140
00:08:45,457 --> 00:08:48,427
Sit down, right? How is it?
Sit down!

141
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,428
Is this a random act
of violence, Papi?

142
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:52,423
Huh?

143
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,504
They shot Lieutenant Dario.

144
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:02,307
Did they get
good descriptions this time?

145
00:09:04,309 --> 00:09:06,278
Did he mention Peligro again?

146
00:09:06,278 --> 00:09:07,370
Mm-hmm.

147
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,246
What happened?

148
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,378
I'm not gonna
have this conversation

149
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:16,250
with you, you, you,
or any of you.

150
00:09:16,254 --> 00:09:17,380
You know what?

151
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:19,254
You have no idea
what's going on in this country.

152
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:21,225
It's sad that you're a professor
and you have zero

153
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,363
zero idea of what is going on
in your own classroom.

154
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:26,331
Then can you enlighten me?

155
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:28,332
Can you tell me what's going on?

156
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:32,429
Discontent, anger...
desperation.

157
00:09:32,504 --> 00:09:34,472
That's what's going
on in this country,

158
00:09:35,307 --> 00:09:36,297
everywhere in this country,

159
00:09:36,341 --> 00:09:38,275
and especially
at your university.

160
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,370
Revolution, okay? It happened in France,
it happened in Russia,

161
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,244
and it's happening here,
and it's happening now.

162
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,315
Nobody wants a revolution.

163
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,475
You don't want a revolution.

164
00:09:46,284 --> 00:09:48,275
But like it or not,
it's coming.

165
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,413
The people, they want it.

166
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,388
How do you know?

167
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,357
Has the people of Cuba spoken to you
in your chosen ears?

168
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:58,429
No. Batista must be eliminated.

169
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:00,226
And then what?

170
00:10:00,332 --> 00:10:02,528
Freedom. Democracy.

171
00:10:02,534 --> 00:10:03,501
Right, yeah.

172
00:10:03,535 --> 00:10:04,503
Power to the people.

173
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:05,504
That's easier said than done.

174
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:06,470
It can be done,

175
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:08,465
but the first thing
you have to do

176
00:10:09,274 --> 00:10:10,434
is kill that son of a bitch.

177
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:11,532
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.

178
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:16,279
Have you ever thought
to live for your country?

179
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:19,250
Yes. Live. I am living!

180
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,219
I live, and I let die.

181
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:22,447
Let the tyrant die.

182
00:10:23,254 --> 00:10:24,517
A fish is caught by its mouth.

183
00:10:25,323 --> 00:10:30,226
You need the earth
on your hands, not blood.

184
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,264
Take sanctuary at the farm.

185
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:35,299
My son doesn't need sanctuary.

186
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:38,301
He just needs
to reform his character,

187
00:10:38,336 --> 00:10:43,274
for a man's character
is his destiny.

188
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:44,342
What book did you get that from?

189
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:45,509
Maybe you should read a couple.

190
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:47,277
Where do you stand, Fico?

191
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:49,506
Where do you stand?

192
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:51,350
Right here with my family.

193
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,476
I see that.
You're just a spectator.

194
00:10:53,485 --> 00:10:55,317
You just watch the parade go by.

195
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:57,288
Let me tell you something, Fico.

196
00:10:57,288 --> 00:10:59,416
Your days of hiding in this cork-lined
palace are numbered.

197
00:10:59,457 --> 00:11:02,255
Pretty soon,
you and you and you

198
00:11:02,394 --> 00:11:04,363
and you are gonna
have to make a decision.

199
00:11:04,429 --> 00:11:06,364
Are you in the parade,
or are you not?

200
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,466
I have made my decision.

201
00:11:11,302 --> 00:11:12,269
That means good night!

202
00:11:12,303 --> 00:11:14,272
Good night in Cuban!

203
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,273
Buenas noches!

204
00:11:17,308 --> 00:11:20,244
Buenas nochesto you all!

205
00:12:00,318 --> 00:12:02,446
Good evening.

206
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:04,447
That depends.

207
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:09,293
It usually does, doesn't it?

208
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:13,432
It was a great show tonight.

209
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:18,461
Great show.

210
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:28,312
Do you know a guy named Peligro?

211
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,313
Who?

212
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:33,443
Peligro.

213
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,447
Is he a percussionist?

214
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,264
Would you know a guy
named Alberto Mora?

215
00:12:47,265 --> 00:12:48,232
Is he a friend of yours?

216
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,390
Someone here to see you.

217
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,408
I had nowhere else to go.

218
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:01,346
Have you seen him?

219
00:13:02,514 --> 00:13:04,482
All the time.

220
00:13:12,524 --> 00:13:16,291
Next time you see him,
say good-bye.

221
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:25,528
When I get to the pearly gates,

222
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:28,404
you know what
I'm gonna ask for, don't you?

223
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,408
A bottle of Bacardi?
No, a case.

224
00:13:30,408 --> 00:13:32,274
Don't forget the Victrola.

225
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:33,403
You're not going anywhere
without your dance partner.

226
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:34,412
Okay, I'll stay.

227
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:40,509
Viejo.
What is he saying?

228
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:42,447
Uh-oh, the ticking clock.

229
00:13:43,288 --> 00:13:44,414
Fico.

230
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:55,389
Well, I wanted to say
that in our house,

231
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,369
Sunday dinner is not...

232
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,370
A moveable feast.

233
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:04,307
Uh-huh. All my sons
are welcome, but not...

234
00:14:04,409 --> 00:14:06,274
Not after6.

235
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:09,405
And it is 6 and 3 minutes, Fico.

236
00:14:09,447 --> 00:14:11,381
I know, but I thought
he said after6.

237
00:14:13,351 --> 00:14:16,446
Okay. Okay. Now, um...

238
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:20,221
I want to make a wish.

239
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:24,389
If change is going
to come to our country,

240
00:14:24,395 --> 00:14:29,264
I wish that our home
remains an island,

241
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:35,306
and that despite
all of our differences,

242
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,342
we always put family first.

243
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:43,280
And food second.

244
00:14:43,414 --> 00:14:44,403
Salud.
Salud.

245
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:47,384
It's a joke, my brother.
I'm just kidding.

246
00:14:57,395 --> 00:14:59,226
So it's all in the family.

247
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:00,331
It's all in the family.

248
00:15:00,331 --> 00:15:02,299
I tell you,
I swear to God it is.

249
00:15:02,433 --> 00:15:05,403
Hello, Senator. How are you?

250
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,461
I've been better.

251
00:15:07,472 --> 00:15:09,441
I come to see your father.

252
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:12,307
No one knows more
about constitutional law.

253
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:14,312
Am I interrupting?

254
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:16,472
I mean, he's picking
for compliments, Senator.

255
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:18,316
Okay, I'm gonna give you one.

256
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,451
Do you think the light
interrupts the day?

257
00:15:20,485 --> 00:15:21,452
Sometimes.

258
00:15:21,486 --> 00:15:24,320
We intend to pass
a resolution

259
00:15:24,322 --> 00:15:25,414
that will remove Batista

260
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:29,452
through the constitutional
process.

261
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:31,292
Senator Cossio has asked me

262
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:33,230
to prepare a speech for him.

263
00:15:33,331 --> 00:15:35,493
This is the opening statement.

264
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:40,327
Uh, I've made reference to Seneca.

265
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:41,306
Read it aloud, Senator,

266
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,467
so we can hear how it sounds.

267
00:15:44,475 --> 00:15:47,445
Okay.
Please.

268
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:53,282
Mr. Speaker,
I must protest...

269
00:15:53,284 --> 00:15:56,345
as Seneca did in ancient Rome,

270
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:59,515
of the violence of office.

271
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:03,489
Today, we, the citizens of Cuba,

272
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:05,462
are being persecuted by a tyrant

273
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:07,490
and his reign of terror,

274
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:11,332
meted out to our population
by his police,

275
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,337
and especially by a certain
colonel in the force

276
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:20,301
whose name has become
synonymous with sudden death.

277
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:24,304
Seneca was persecuted
by two tyrants,

278
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,318
Caligula and Nero.

279
00:16:27,485 --> 00:16:29,283
In spite of that,

280
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:32,448
Seneca advocated the return
to the Republic...

281
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:35,452
unafraid.

282
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:40,421
Mr. Speaker, Seneca,
not the Neros of this world,

283
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:44,530
should be an example to us.

284
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:59,442
Fangio, I am your biggest fan.

285
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:02,283
Get in the car.
Just get in the car.

286
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:03,413
Get in the car.
Get in.

287
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:06,288
What do you want? Money?

288
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,258
Publicity.

289
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:11,429
Fangio freed,
Grand Prix cancelled,

290
00:17:11,462 --> 00:17:13,431
26th of July Movement responsible.

291
00:17:14,298 --> 00:17:15,424
And listen to what Fangio said.

292
00:17:15,433 --> 00:17:16,365
All they wanted from me

293
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:18,494
is that I help them
further their cause.

294
00:17:18,503 --> 00:17:22,337
But I don't know anything
about causes, only cars.

295
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,338
And when they ask him
how he was treated,

296
00:17:24,509 --> 00:17:26,443
They were quintessential
gentlemen.

297
00:17:27,278 --> 00:17:29,405
Do you think I'm a quintessential
gentleman, Mercedes?

298
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,449
Huh?

299
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,277
What was so funny?
What were you laughing about?

300
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,221
The funnies.

301
00:17:37,355 --> 00:17:38,516
The funnies?
That newspaper has no funnies.

302
00:17:40,358 --> 00:17:42,259
Why don't you try the one
about the kidnappers

303
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:43,282
who only wanted publicity?

304
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:44,261
Stop it!

305
00:17:44,462 --> 00:17:46,396
That's funny. That's funny.

306
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:47,487
Leave him alone! Stop!

307
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,358
Yeah. Come on.

308
00:17:51,369 --> 00:17:52,496
Stop! Let him go!

309
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,432
Please stop!

310
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:01,344
Stop it! Stop it!

311
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,346
Stop it!

312
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,359
Huh?

313
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:16,519
You want to be tough? Huh?

314
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:19,361
Wanna play in my city?

315
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:20,490
Spoiled rich bastard!

316
00:18:22,366 --> 00:18:25,358
You do not want
to disappoint me.

317
00:18:25,403 --> 00:18:28,338
Believe me.

318
00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:30,307
I'm gonna go for a walk.

319
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:33,310
When I get back,

320
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:35,471
I want you to tell
me who Peligro is.

321
00:18:43,321 --> 00:18:44,448
I'm back.

322
00:18:46,491 --> 00:18:49,461
Who's Peligro? Huh?

323
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,394
You're not a good listener.

324
00:19:00,271 --> 00:19:03,240
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

325
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:20,446
Ooh. No, I'm okay, I'm okay.

326
00:19:20,491 --> 00:19:24,326
I'm gonna go for a walk, okay?

327
00:19:24,328 --> 00:19:26,297
So you better be thinking about
who Peligro is,

328
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,296
'cause you're next.

329
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,269
Let's go for some coffee.

330
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:35,296
You're here about your brother.

331
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,240
Your little brother's a criminal

332
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,403
a dangerous criminal.

333
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:41,241
No doubt about that.

334
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:43,248
I've got his file
if you wanna read it.

335
00:19:43,281 --> 00:19:45,250
No, thank you.

336
00:19:46,417 --> 00:19:48,249
I know my brother,

337
00:19:48,252 --> 00:19:51,483
and no file will ever change that.

338
00:19:51,522 --> 00:19:56,256
Fico, we've known each other
since we were in prep school.

339
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,386
I've always
been straight with you.

340
00:19:57,395 --> 00:19:58,363
That's true.

341
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:00,327
Have you ever known me
to change my signals?

342
00:20:00,464 --> 00:20:02,296
Not when you were my catcher.

343
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,359
Fico, you're pitching
for your brother now.

344
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:06,336
You're pitching wild.

345
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:08,497
He's guilty.
There's no doubt about that.

346
00:20:09,307 --> 00:20:11,434
I know it and you know it.

347
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,278
He's my brother, Braulio.

348
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,281
I need your help.

349
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:26,257
Okay.

350
00:20:27,358 --> 00:20:28,451
I think you should
get out of Havana,

351
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,250
go to New York or Miami,

352
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:32,262
and I'm gonna take
care of the tickets.

353
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:34,265
Fico, Fidel's gonna
take care of me.

354
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,269
I'm leaving for
the Sierra Maestra.

355
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:39,429
Hey.

356
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:44,275
Fico, I have no choice.

357
00:20:47,445 --> 00:20:49,277
What about your family?

358
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:52,282
Everything I do
is for my family.

359
00:20:57,321 --> 00:20:58,448
I love you.

360
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:13,499
Uh, come in.

361
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:16,363
Can I help you?

362
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,343
Al sent me.

363
00:21:18,376 --> 00:21:19,502
Who?

364
00:21:21,512 --> 00:21:23,276
Al.

365
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:24,508
He's a friend of yours, isn't he?

366
00:21:24,548 --> 00:21:26,346
Are you auditioning?

367
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:29,319
Yes, I am.

368
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:30,480
What's your line?

369
00:21:30,521 --> 00:21:31,489
I'm a comedian.

370
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,325
I'm a stand-up comedian

371
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:39,296
who prefers to remain seated.

372
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,423
That's it?
That's your line?

373
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,229
Yeah.

374
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:44,460
Some jokes for your emcee.

375
00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:46,259
He writes his own jokes.

376
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,397
They're lousy. So are yours.

377
00:21:48,406 --> 00:21:50,375
Touch?

378
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,433
You want some help writing
some of your other material?

379
00:21:52,443 --> 00:21:55,208
Nobody writes anybody's
material around here.

380
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:56,338
You just improvise?

381
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:58,280
You can call it that.
Try New York.

382
00:21:58,282 --> 00:22:01,251
Too cold. Too rich.

383
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:02,309
Too close to home.

384
00:22:02,453 --> 00:22:04,318
Well, I'm afraid
you're going to have to

385
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,381
find another line of work, then.

386
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:07,316
I can't.

387
00:22:07,358 --> 00:22:10,294
The laughter
you just become addicted to it.

388
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:12,262
What'd you say your name was?

389
00:22:12,263 --> 00:22:16,461
I didn't.
I said Al sent me.

390
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,460
If you know Al, you know me.

391
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:23,307
Oh, Al's friend.

392
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,474
Where've you been?

393
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,339
Where haven't I been?

394
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,313
Federico, remember your
appointment.

395
00:22:28,512 --> 00:22:30,344
And don't forget your dancing
shoes.

396
00:22:30,481 --> 00:22:31,449
You're going to need them.

397
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:35,308
Oh, Rodney?

398
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,480
Maestro?

399
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:40,325
Oh, never mind.

400
00:22:42,493 --> 00:22:46,327
I think I have
a job for you after all.

401
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,491
Finally, after all these years

402
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,491
of sacrifice and dedication,

403
00:22:51,502 --> 00:22:54,336
a break.

404
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:02,346
Why can't you tell
me who we're meeting?

405
00:23:02,346 --> 00:23:03,314
It's better that way.

406
00:23:03,347 --> 00:23:04,372
I love surprises.

407
00:23:04,415 --> 00:23:05,440
Just don't say a word

408
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,240
no matter what.

409
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:09,445
Sit there,
pretend you're my security. That's it.

410
00:23:09,453 --> 00:23:11,422
How's this?
Cozy enough?

411
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:13,416
Look a little bit more dangerous.

412
00:23:13,424 --> 00:23:15,393
How about this?

413
00:23:17,461 --> 00:23:18,291
More dangerous.

414
00:23:19,463 --> 00:23:21,432
This is my meanest.

415
00:23:24,435 --> 00:23:26,267
Save that.

416
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:28,271
Can I make a wish?

417
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:29,397
Be my guest.

418
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:34,444
I wish for a tall, athletic,
caramel-colored beauty.

419
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:35,445
Okay.

420
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:41,478
An open-door policy
is the sign of a great host.

421
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:44,288
Mr. Lansky, come in.
Welcome.

422
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:47,321
Should I call you Federico,

423
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:50,294
Mr. Fellove, or Fico?

424
00:23:52,463 --> 00:23:56,298
Depends on whether
you shake my hand or not.

425
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:57,460
Call me Fico.

426
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:59,436
You can call my Meyer.
All my friends do.

427
00:24:00,337 --> 00:24:02,306
Have a seat.

428
00:24:03,474 --> 00:24:04,442
Who is this guy?

429
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:07,444
Don't mind him,
he's just a comedian.

430
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:08,445
A blind one?

431
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,446
Mute.

432
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,278
That's funny.

433
00:24:11,282 --> 00:24:12,340
Would you like a drink?

434
00:24:12,483 --> 00:24:16,477
A little seltzer,
unless you happen to, uh...

435
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:17,454
have an egg cream.

436
00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:19,278
I have eggs and I have cream.

437
00:24:19,423 --> 00:24:20,413
And you have a blind comedian.

438
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:22,355
Mute.

439
00:24:24,528 --> 00:24:26,394
An egg cream
is neither egg nor cream.

440
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:28,398
Would you like
to know how to make one?

441
00:24:28,532 --> 00:24:29,500
Well, that would've
been my next question.

442
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:31,428
Well, let? S see
how this goes first.

443
00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:35,261
A little seltzer for now.
Cuts the humidity.

444
00:24:38,442 --> 00:24:40,501
You hear that, comedian?

445
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:42,439
You said something on the
phone about a business opportunity.

446
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:46,240
Well played. Le Chaim.

447
00:24:48,452 --> 00:24:51,286
I propose
a partnership between us.

448
00:24:51,288 --> 00:24:54,258
20% goes to the house,

449
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:56,317
the rest to me, my associates.

450
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:57,383
It doesn't have
to be anything big.

451
00:24:58,296 --> 00:24:59,422
I mean, this is very cozy here.

452
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,261
You could have a couple of tables,

453
00:25:01,298 --> 00:25:04,426
craps, you know, blackjack,
a wheel or two.

454
00:25:04,435 --> 00:25:06,267
This is nice.

455
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,271
Mr. Lansky

456
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:12,435
Call him Meyer.

457
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,436
Or Mr. Lansky.

458
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,440
You want him here?

459
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:19,442
Meyer, I appreciate the offer,

460
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:21,351
but, regretfully, I have to pass.

461
00:25:21,452 --> 00:25:24,319
Now, I know this is
a tremendous opportunity for me.

462
00:25:24,321 --> 00:25:27,450
However, El Tropico
is a place of music,

463
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,426
and that's how
I would like it to stay.

464
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:34,423
Let me rephrase.

465
00:25:34,465 --> 00:25:36,297
We have the beginning

466
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,291
of a mutually
beneficial relationship.

467
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:40,430
It would be a pity to see it end
before it even began.

468
00:25:40,471 --> 00:25:41,439
Yes, it would.

469
00:25:41,472 --> 00:25:43,441
All right.

470
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:51,346
I was informed
you were a reasonable man.

471
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:53,314
I hope I wasn't misinformed.

472
00:25:53,317 --> 00:25:54,285
You weren't.

473
00:25:54,451 --> 00:25:56,442
What I can offer you in return

474
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:58,455
is what I offer all my friends

475
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,458
an open-door policy.

476
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:03,351
Consider my club
your home any time.

477
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:05,461
What, free seltzer?

478
00:26:05,462 --> 00:26:08,227
As much as you want.

479
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:10,233
You know, in my business,
Mr. Fellove,

480
00:26:10,434 --> 00:26:12,403
we have friends
and we have enemies,

481
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:15,397
but we don't
have acquaintances.

482
00:26:17,241 --> 00:26:20,369
I hope to hear
some good news very soon.

483
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:34,384
Is that Meyer Lansky...
Meyer Lansky?

484
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:36,359
The head of the mob.

485
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:38,224
I resign.

486
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:03,253
Are you wearing false eyelashes,
or are you truly bashful?

487
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,413
I never wear false eyelashes.

488
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:05,354
That's my girl.

489
00:27:06,523 --> 00:27:07,490
Am I?

490
00:27:30,347 --> 00:27:31,440
Whose idea was that?

491
00:27:31,482 --> 00:27:33,473
Rodney's.

492
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,480
Are you gonna be watching?

493
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,321
Always.

494
00:28:12,356 --> 00:28:14,325
What's the matter?

495
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,330
What's wrong?

496
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,458
Luis has another woman.

497
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,297
Another woman?

498
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:32,241
He hasn't come home in two days,

499
00:28:32,242 --> 00:28:36,373
and before that, we haven't

500
00:28:36,413 --> 00:28:38,507
His mind is elsewhere.

501
00:28:40,484 --> 00:28:42,281
Has he called?

502
00:28:42,453 --> 00:28:44,354
Just to say that he's okay,

503
00:28:44,388 --> 00:28:46,516
and that's all he says.

504
00:28:48,358 --> 00:28:51,259
Fico, help me.

505
00:28:51,395 --> 00:28:54,387
You're the only one
I can turn to.

506
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:56,365
I'm gonna take care of it.

507
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:24,421
She's worried about you.

508
00:29:28,298 --> 00:29:29,424
She came to you?

509
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,431
She's always had a...

510
00:29:36,473 --> 00:29:39,340
very special place
in her heart for you.

511
00:29:39,376 --> 00:29:41,470
And you for her.

512
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:44,448
What's the matter? Talk to me.

513
00:29:44,481 --> 00:29:47,315
I'm not gonna get you involved.

514
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:50,480
I'm your brother. I'm involved.
What's up?

515
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:52,318
Is it another woman?

516
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:53,289
Yes.

517
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,258
Liberty.

518
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:23,319
You involved with Fidel?
No.

519
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:25,321
26th of July Movement,
like Ricardo?

520
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:26,289
No.

521
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:31,422
Directorio Revolucionario.

522
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:33,396
We're no longer associated.

523
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:36,400
We have our own ideas for Cuba.

524
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:39,394
Pluralism,

525
00:30:39,403 --> 00:30:41,372
the restoration of
the 1940 Constitution.

526
00:30:42,272 --> 00:30:43,240
You know, democracy.

527
00:30:43,273 --> 00:30:44,400
That's what Fidel says he wants.

528
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:47,377
Sure, that's what he says,
but he can't be trusted.

529
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:50,381
You think he's a Communist?

530
00:30:50,414 --> 00:30:51,507
A Fidelista.

531
00:30:58,388 --> 00:31:00,481
You have to promise me something.

532
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:01,491
What?

533
00:31:04,494 --> 00:31:06,326
Anything happens to me...

534
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,526
you'll look after Aurora.

535
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:15,295
She'll need you.

536
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:16,432
Here, promise me.

537
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:21,244
Promise me, Fico.

538
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:25,382
I need this from you.

539
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,442
I promise you.

540
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:29,252
But you're gonna promise me

541
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:32,346
that nothing's gonna
happen to you, right?

542
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,423
Right?

543
00:31:34,424 --> 00:31:38,259
There's no happiness
outside the revolution.

544
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:49,506
Okay.

545
00:31:54,378 --> 00:31:57,279
Don't do something stupid.

546
00:31:57,281 --> 00:31:59,272
Okay?

547
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:36,511
Ricardo Fellove,
26th of July Movement.

548
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:40,354
Fellove.
Are you the dancer?

549
00:32:40,357 --> 00:32:43,451
Because we don't need any dancers.

550
00:32:46,463 --> 00:32:49,455
Okay, get off the horse.
We're hungry.

551
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:09,344
It's not another woman.

552
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:12,387
Then why won't he come back?

553
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:13,480
He doesn't want us involved.

554
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,384
What is it?
The revolution?

555
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:17,486
He doesn't want us involved.

556
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:19,329
That's it?

557
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:20,455
That's it.

558
00:33:30,307 --> 00:33:34,267
Am I supposed to
take that home and be happy?

559
00:33:34,311 --> 00:33:36,246
I'm his wife.

560
00:33:36,413 --> 00:33:38,472
I have the right to be involved.

561
00:33:38,482 --> 00:33:42,249
If something happens to him,
it happens to me.

562
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:43,412
To all of us.

563
00:33:43,453 --> 00:33:45,512
And then what?

564
00:34:33,403 --> 00:34:37,237
I think it was the Mafia, Meyer Lansky,

565
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:40,335
but I can't be certain.

566
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:44,346
Havana is no longer a capital city,

567
00:34:44,347 --> 00:34:48,250
but a capital sin.

568
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:51,351
This is
not new, of course,

569
00:34:51,521 --> 00:34:56,481
but even Jesus had
to whip the moneylenders

570
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:58,324
out of the temple.

571
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:03,231
We're badly in need of a

572
00:35:03,266 --> 00:35:05,393
of a Christ with a whip.

573
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:12,304
I don't know what to do.

574
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:22,250
Satyagraha.

575
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,344
Do you know what that is?

576
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:26,288
No.

577
00:35:26,289 --> 00:35:28,382
It is the Hindu word

578
00:35:28,425 --> 00:35:32,362
For passive resistance.

579
00:35:32,362 --> 00:35:37,266
Gandhi resisted passively,

580
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,268
and he won.

581
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:44,498
My son, in the sea,

582
00:35:44,541 --> 00:35:46,510
even a shark can drown.

583
00:36:19,342 --> 00:36:21,311
Okay, we all know how to make it

584
00:36:21,344 --> 00:36:23,313
into the Presidential Palace
by heart now?

585
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,280
So let's review one last time.

586
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,510
I will take over the CNQ radio station
and read our statement.

587
00:36:28,385 --> 00:36:29,353
Carbo?

588
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:32,284
Machado and I will attack with
Peligro through the main gates,

589
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:34,423
along with Menoyo and his group.

590
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:36,425
Ignacio, you will
provide sniper protection

591
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:38,226
and reinforcements.

592
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,454
Any questions?

593
00:36:43,266 --> 00:36:45,326
What do you think, Peligro?

594
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:55,242
It's time.

595
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:58,231
Mockingbird Pet Shop.
Can I help you?

596
00:37:58,342 --> 00:38:00,434
The bird is in the cage.

597
00:38:04,514 --> 00:38:06,449
He's in.

598
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,311
Long live a free Cuba.

599
00:38:11,454 --> 00:38:13,389
Long live a free Cuba.

600
00:38:19,396 --> 00:38:20,523
Mr. President?

601
00:38:24,367 --> 00:38:26,335
Mr. President?

602
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:30,371
What is it, Pizzi?

603
00:38:30,407 --> 00:38:34,275
There are urgent matters
for you to attend to.

604
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:42,219
I've been signing
edicts all week,

605
00:38:42,385 --> 00:38:45,355
and you know what
I've been thinking, Pizzi?

606
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:47,356
I'm a fortunate man

607
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:51,224
for having had to sign
one single death warrant.

608
00:38:51,394 --> 00:38:54,364
Mr. President,
if I might say so myself,

609
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:58,356
you are a fortunate man,
but also a noble man.

610
00:38:58,402 --> 00:39:00,369
Thank you, Pizzi.
That's very kind of you.

611
00:39:01,237 --> 00:39:03,206
No, no, no, no, no.
It is not kindness.

612
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:05,333
It is historical justice.

613
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:20,389
Have I ever told you
how much I appreciate you?

614
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:23,416
No, sir.

615
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,485
Oh.

616
00:39:35,338 --> 00:39:36,306
Sorry I'm late.

617
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,465
I got stuck in Pinelarillo

618
00:39:39,309 --> 00:39:40,242
what do you want?

619
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:41,471
I got 450 napkins and tablecloths.

620
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:44,309
I'm gonna need help
getting it out of here.

621
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:46,373
I don't have any deliveries
on my list today.

622
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,351
This is the front gate, right?

623
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,284
Yeah, it's the front gate.

624
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,378
They told me 3:00 at the front gate.

625
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:53,389
Can you check?
Can you

626
00:39:53,423 --> 00:39:55,255
All right.
Stay there.

627
00:39:57,394 --> 00:39:58,384
Is any deliveries on the list today?

628
00:39:59,262 --> 00:40:00,251
No.

629
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:19,246
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

630
00:40:19,315 --> 00:40:20,282
Go ahead, go in!

631
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:21,340
Here!

632
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:27,422
What's that noise?

633
00:40:42,505 --> 00:40:43,472
Come with me! Now!

634
00:41:50,273 --> 00:41:51,240
Let's go!

635
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:13,355
Fico! The palace is being attacked.

636
00:42:13,429 --> 00:42:16,456
Listen. Manzanita's taken over
the radio station.

637
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:23,431
People of Cuba, the dictator
Fulgencio Batista

638
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:26,271
has just met revolutionary justice.

639
00:42:27,277 --> 00:42:28,244
The gunfire that extinguished

640
00:42:28,278 --> 00:42:29,405
the bloody life of the dictator

641
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,248
can still be heard around
the Presidential Palace.

642
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:35,251
It is we,
The Directorio Revolucionario,

643
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:37,378
the iron hand of
the Cuban Revolution

644
00:42:37,487 --> 00:42:38,476
who have accomplished the final
blow

645
00:42:38,521 --> 00:42:39,489
against this shameful regime

646
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:41,353
still twisting in its own agony.

647
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:44,291
Cubans who can hear me,
he has just been eliminated.

648
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,326
Long live a free Cuba!

649
00:42:46,429 --> 00:42:48,398
Que vive una Cuba libre!

650
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,414
Carbo! Carbo!

651
00:43:15,425 --> 00:43:17,393
Luis! Luis!

652
00:43:17,427 --> 00:43:18,394
Luis!

653
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:21,286
Luis!

654
00:43:25,268 --> 00:43:26,429
Luis!

655
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:37,541
Pizzi, leave us alone.

656
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:45,282
With friends or without friends?

657
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,382
As you like.

658
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:58,201
Pizzi.

659
00:43:58,402 --> 00:43:59,369
Yes, sir?

660
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:10,311
People of Cuba,

661
00:44:10,347 --> 00:44:14,407
today alien forces
made an attempt on my life.

662
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:20,253
As you can see,

663
00:44:20,289 --> 00:44:24,487
the news of my demise
is vastly exaggerated.

664
00:44:24,494 --> 00:44:29,329
The President now declares
business as usual in Havana.

665
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:35,431
I lend a helping hand to
those law-abiding citizens

666
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:38,400
and our loyal oppositions.

667
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:45,204
The future of Cuba is safe.

668
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,442
Abuelo!

669
00:44:50,353 --> 00:44:54,347
Our children are safe.

670
00:44:58,394 --> 00:45:00,362
That is all.

671
00:45:00,496 --> 00:45:02,465
Salud.

672
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,373
Life is becoming
a dress rehearsal

673
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:15,503
for a show nobody'll see.

674
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:22,318
What's the word on Luis?

675
00:45:22,351 --> 00:45:23,478
He's nowhere to be found.

676
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:24,454
Are you sure he's alive?

677
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:27,280
Positive.

678
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:30,385
He might be abroad.

679
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:33,351
I'm leaving.

680
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:36,362
I'm leaving.

681
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:46,371
I'm sorry.
There's no news.

682
00:45:47,376 --> 00:45:48,344
Was he part of the attack?

683
00:45:48,545 --> 00:45:49,375
Yes.

684
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:52,447
Why won't you tell me where he is?

685
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:54,280
Because I don't know where he is.

686
00:45:56,286 --> 00:45:57,514
Fico, if something happens,

687
00:45:57,521 --> 00:45:59,489
I want to be there...

688
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:00,489
for him.

689
00:46:00,523 --> 00:46:01,490
So do I.

690
00:49:20,289 --> 00:49:22,349
May I offer a serious thought

691
00:49:22,391 --> 00:49:24,326
from someone who's never serious?

692
00:49:25,394 --> 00:49:26,452
No.

693
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:28,498
Well, that was it.

694
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:57,418
Mmm.

695
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:58,449
It's good.

696
00:50:02,431 --> 00:50:05,264
A man with a purpose.

697
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:30,492
A man with less of a purpose.

698
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:35,331
Fellove, come on.
Please join me.

699
00:50:35,364 --> 00:50:38,492
Mmm. Mmm!

700
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:47,309
In our house,

701
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:49,311
Sunday dinner is not
a moveable feast.

702
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:56,318
It is at 6, as usual.

703
00:50:57,521 --> 00:50:59,351
Sorry.

704
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:03,452
All my sons are welcome, but...

705
00:51:03,492 --> 00:51:05,289
not a minute after6.

706
00:51:08,465 --> 00:51:12,367
You must always chew.
It's good for your health.

707
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:14,233
You chew and you chew.

708
00:51:15,271 --> 00:51:16,398
Mmm.

709
00:51:16,405 --> 00:51:18,373
And then you chew some more.

710
00:51:22,378 --> 00:51:26,338
See, I'm a man of...
good digestion.

711
00:51:26,382 --> 00:51:31,445
In fact, if I wasn't
such a modest man,

712
00:51:31,454 --> 00:51:33,422
I'd say I'm a man
of great digestion.

713
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:38,322
That's why I'm still alive.

714
00:51:38,427 --> 00:51:40,259
About our little business...

715
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:45,391
our business?

716
00:51:45,501 --> 00:51:47,469
Yeah, our business.

717
00:51:47,471 --> 00:51:49,371
My business is El Tropico.

718
00:51:49,405 --> 00:51:52,398
And I would love to continue
going to El Tropico.

719
00:51:56,445 --> 00:52:01,280
So unless that's a prop
for one of your new shows...

720
00:52:02,552 --> 00:52:07,353
I'm asking myself,

721
00:52:07,356 --> 00:52:09,324
what is a song and dance man

722
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:10,326
because that's what you do, huh?

723
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:11,494
Just a little song and dance,

724
00:52:11,527 --> 00:52:13,496
and you put on a little show

725
00:52:13,496 --> 00:52:15,465
doing with a.32 caliber
Smith & Wesson?

726
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:17,494
What? Hey!

727
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,367
What?

728
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:23,369
What, are you planning
to shoot your piano player?

729
00:52:23,539 --> 00:52:26,509
Do you have a new
cowboy routine

730
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:28,373
in El Tropico now,
or something?

731
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:36,485
Any word from Ricardo?

732
00:52:38,454 --> 00:52:39,422
No.

733
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:45,360
Why were you late
for dinner tonight?

734
00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:49,396
Hmm?

735
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:53,494
I have enemies.

736
00:52:55,304 --> 00:52:56,271
Cono.

737
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,304
And I have the right
to protect myself.

738
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:02,333
Cono.

739
00:53:02,344 --> 00:53:05,313
Fellove, am I your enemy?

740
00:53:05,481 --> 00:53:08,382
You weren't my enemy until
you killed my brother.

741
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:13,422
Luis Fellove, alias Peligro.

742
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:17,260
Not angel,

743
00:53:17,293 --> 00:53:19,420
not the Virgin Mary

744
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:21,422
Peligro!

745
00:53:21,463 --> 00:53:24,262
I swear,
I did not kill your brother.

746
00:53:24,333 --> 00:53:27,326
Your brother attacked
the Presidential Palace

747
00:53:27,503 --> 00:53:29,472
with the intent to kill
my President.

748
00:53:31,474 --> 00:53:33,338
He committed suicide.

749
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:41,315
Believe me, you do not want
to disappoint me.

750
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:42,248
Trust me on this.

751
00:53:45,521 --> 00:53:49,288
I can see
all you have is thirst for revenge.

752
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:58,391
Ah, I see.

753
00:53:58,467 --> 00:54:04,498
You know what a zugzwang is?

754
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:06,338
It's a chess move.

755
00:54:06,342 --> 00:54:07,434
Mm-hmm.

756
00:54:07,476 --> 00:54:12,311
It is a chess move
that is no move at all.

757
00:54:14,483 --> 00:54:17,452
It is actually a position

758
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:21,255
the position in which each player

759
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:25,317
will obtain a worse result

760
00:54:25,427 --> 00:54:29,387
if it were his time to move

761
00:54:29,465 --> 00:54:32,333
than if it were not.

762
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:35,338
Do you follow?

763
00:54:35,472 --> 00:54:37,405
A double-bind.

764
00:54:39,275 --> 00:54:40,503
A reciprocal situation.

765
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:47,476
All you have to do
is act accordingly.

766
00:54:47,483 --> 00:54:49,384
Which means...

767
00:54:56,525 --> 00:54:58,460
Do not act at all.

768
00:54:59,262 --> 00:55:00,489
Go.

769
00:55:14,277 --> 00:55:16,244
Ho ho ho!

770
00:55:16,278 --> 00:55:17,405
Hey, hey!

771
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:20,382
Bravissimo, Fellove!
Bravissimo!

772
00:55:20,416 --> 00:55:23,215
A showman to the end!

773
00:55:29,358 --> 00:55:32,452
One more audition.

774
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,530
So just about any
clothes fit you, huh?

775
00:55:47,443 --> 00:55:49,503
She's very lonely.

776
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:52,378
Ever since she moved in,
she won't go out at all.

777
00:55:53,248 --> 00:55:54,510
Not even with her friends.

778
00:55:56,552 --> 00:55:59,385
The memory of your brother,

779
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:01,356
and the fact that she
has not been able

780
00:56:01,523 --> 00:56:05,324
to have a family of her own...

781
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:07,329
I hate to see her so sad.

782
00:56:07,329 --> 00:56:09,264
It breaks my heart.

783
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,467
Why don't you ask her out?

784
00:56:13,302 --> 00:56:14,429
She would like that.

785
00:56:14,471 --> 00:56:16,268
It would do her good.

786
00:56:19,275 --> 00:56:23,233
She needs you, and you need her.

787
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,248
Fico, talk to me.

788
00:56:59,282 --> 00:57:01,340
Please.

789
00:57:07,389 --> 00:57:10,382
You know the last thing
Luis said to me before he died?

790
00:57:14,329 --> 00:57:15,456
What?

791
00:57:16,331 --> 00:57:17,458
He made me promise...

792
00:57:20,369 --> 00:57:21,461
that if anything ever happened to
him,

793
00:57:21,503 --> 00:57:23,335
I would take care of you.

794
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:40,420
You've grown up in Havana all your
life,

795
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:44,454
and I bet there's parts of the
city you don't know at all.

796
00:57:47,329 --> 00:57:48,422
I'm sure you know them well.

797
00:57:48,431 --> 00:57:49,523
You know...

798
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:53,297
Havana's very much like a rose.

799
00:57:53,335 --> 00:57:57,295
It has petals, and it has thorns.

800
00:57:57,306 --> 00:57:58,432
So it depends on how you grab it.

801
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:02,240
But in the end,
it always grabs you.

802
00:58:07,382 --> 00:58:09,476
Why don't you come out
with me tomorrow?

803
00:58:09,518 --> 00:58:11,349
It'll do you good.

804
00:58:20,396 --> 00:58:22,523
You ever see Beny Mor? Live?

805
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:24,362
Mmm.

806
00:58:24,534 --> 00:58:26,364
Ah!

807
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:33,275
Have you been to
the Tropical Beer Gardens?

808
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:35,411
Ah!

809
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:42,518
It's good to see you smile.

810
00:59:22,391 --> 00:59:23,449
Thank you.

811
00:59:23,458 --> 00:59:25,289
Why are their handkerchiefs?

812
00:59:25,295 --> 00:59:29,425
The handkerchiefs
are so there's no evidence.

813
00:59:29,465 --> 00:59:31,398
Of what?

814
00:59:33,402 --> 00:59:35,371
Of the intimacy they're sharing.

815
00:59:51,286 --> 00:59:52,514
Beny! Beny!

816
00:59:52,521 --> 00:59:58,391
Beny! Beny! Beny!

817
00:59:58,393 --> 00:59:59,519
Beny! Beny!

818
01:00:00,396 --> 01:00:02,364
Where is he?

819
01:00:02,398 --> 01:00:03,523
He's always late.

820
01:00:04,333 --> 01:00:09,369
Beny! Beny! Beny!

821
01:00:09,472 --> 01:00:11,268
Beny! Beny!

822
01:00:11,407 --> 01:00:13,271
He likes to make an entrance.

823
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,402
There he is.

824
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:13,318
How many more are in the barracks?

825
01:02:13,362 --> 01:02:14,487
Come on. Come on.

826
01:02:14,496 --> 01:02:16,327
How many more are in the barracks?

827
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:20,492
Fellove!

828
01:02:20,503 --> 01:02:24,496
Let's move. Don't waste
any time with that.

829
01:02:24,539 --> 01:02:25,507
Let's move.

830
01:02:29,512 --> 01:02:31,309
You seem troubled, Fellove.

831
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,384
Is it about the captain we shot?

832
01:02:36,251 --> 01:02:38,516
Listen to me very carefully.

833
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:40,318
In an insurrection,

834
01:02:40,356 --> 01:02:42,324
the end justifies the means.

835
01:02:44,293 --> 01:02:45,418
What is an insurrection?

836
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:47,394
Huh?

837
01:02:47,429 --> 01:02:48,396
Armed struggle.

838
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:51,358
What is the end?

839
01:02:51,367 --> 01:02:52,425
Revolution.

840
01:02:52,467 --> 01:02:56,403
Which entails social, economic,
and political transformations.

841
01:02:58,273 --> 01:02:59,240
Like I said?

842
01:03:00,409 --> 01:03:03,434
The end justifies the means.

843
01:03:03,445 --> 01:03:05,277
Hmm?

844
01:04:51,454 --> 01:04:52,420
This is Havana.

845
01:04:55,490 --> 01:04:57,458
Who said a woman
is like a flower?

846
01:04:58,327 --> 01:05:00,295
A poet with a sense of smell.

847
01:05:07,469 --> 01:05:09,460
May I join you?

848
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:11,302
Yes.

849
01:05:19,282 --> 01:05:21,340
What was your name again?

850
01:05:21,349 --> 01:05:24,318
My name again is no name.

851
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,445
What do you mean?

852
01:05:25,487 --> 01:05:27,456
I don't mean nothing!

853
01:05:29,492 --> 01:05:32,460
Names don't mean, people do.

854
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:35,429
But you are people, aren't you?

855
01:05:36,264 --> 01:05:41,293
That... nobody can deny.

856
01:05:41,304 --> 01:05:43,271
So what's your name, then?

857
01:05:44,472 --> 01:05:46,304
I have no name.

858
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:48,402
I already told you that.

859
01:05:48,443 --> 01:05:50,275
Everybody has a name.

860
01:05:50,278 --> 01:05:53,407
Mm-hmm.
Everybody but me.

861
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:54,416
Why not?

862
01:06:00,422 --> 01:06:02,253
I don't know.

863
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:04,259
Ask him.

864
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:05,260
Leave me out of your puns.

865
01:06:07,429 --> 01:06:10,228
You're the strangest man
I ever met.

866
01:06:18,541 --> 01:06:19,507
Thank you.

867
01:06:22,378 --> 01:06:23,344
Thank you.

868
01:06:24,547 --> 01:06:26,344
Okay, Emilio.

869
01:06:27,449 --> 01:06:28,507
Your moneys no good here.

870
01:06:29,351 --> 01:06:31,320
Thank you, Emilio.

871
01:06:31,353 --> 01:06:32,320
I'll see you at the club.

872
01:06:34,356 --> 01:06:35,324
When I grow up,

873
01:06:35,490 --> 01:06:37,288
I wanna be just like him.

874
01:06:38,393 --> 01:06:40,362
Why?

875
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:42,492
Because...

876
01:06:42,530 --> 01:06:44,327
he never pays.

877
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:55,443
we interrupt
this program with a special news report.

878
01:06:58,514 --> 01:07:02,280
The University of Havana was
closed by the government today,

879
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:05,309
as a direct result
of the ongoing riots.

880
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:06,447
President Fulgencio Batista,

881
01:07:06,489 --> 01:07:08,456
who is under intense pressure
to resign,

882
01:07:08,490 --> 01:07:10,458
declared publicly today
that the government

883
01:07:10,492 --> 01:07:13,518
will not tolerate the disgracing
of the sacred grounds

884
01:07:13,528 --> 01:07:15,496
of the university's Plaza Cadena,

885
01:07:15,530 --> 01:07:18,500
which he claims the professional
agitators were using

886
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:21,367
for their selfish acts of anarchy.

887
01:08:02,545 --> 01:08:03,512
She wants to talk to you.

888
01:08:04,547 --> 01:08:05,514
It's okay.

889
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:10,451
El tiempo no estacon ustedes.

890
01:08:14,255 --> 01:08:15,347
What did she say?

891
01:08:15,523 --> 01:08:17,492
Time is not on our side.

892
01:08:44,392 --> 01:08:45,381
Fico! Fico!

893
01:08:45,426 --> 01:08:46,551
Braulio.
Hey!

894
01:08:46,594 --> 01:08:48,562
Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.

895
01:08:48,596 --> 01:08:50,564
How are you?
Same to you, my friend.

896
01:08:50,598 --> 01:08:51,565
This is Aurora.

897
01:08:51,599 --> 01:08:53,430
This is Captain Castel

898
01:08:53,434 --> 01:08:55,560
and his lovely wife Marie Cristina.
How are you?

899
01:08:55,603 --> 01:08:57,571
The pleasure's mine.

900
01:08:57,572 --> 01:08:58,538
Ah.

901
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:00,565
You know, this is our year, Fico.

902
01:09:00,608 --> 01:09:01,574
I just got promoted.

903
01:09:02,443 --> 01:09:03,569
Congratulations.
Thanks again.

904
01:09:04,444 --> 01:09:06,413
Well... it wasn't
because he's your brother.

905
01:09:06,447 --> 01:09:08,415
It's because you're
still my favorite pitcher.

906
01:09:08,449 --> 01:09:09,416
Well, you won't regret it.

907
01:09:09,584 --> 01:09:11,415
Well, I hope not.

908
01:09:11,452 --> 01:09:12,419
If you're wrong,

909
01:09:12,587 --> 01:09:14,417
not even your curveball's
gonna save you.

910
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:16,556
Let's dance.
Okay.

911
01:09:16,591 --> 01:09:17,558
Bye-bye.
Happy New Year.

912
01:09:18,459 --> 01:09:19,585
Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.

913
01:09:49,623 --> 01:09:52,457
Senoras y senores,
ladies and gentlemen,

914
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:54,425
it's almost New Year's

915
01:09:54,428 --> 01:09:57,556
here at El Tropico
and all over the world!

916
01:09:57,565 --> 01:10:00,534
We have ignition.
Engines running.

917
01:10:01,368 --> 01:10:02,495
Countdown!

918
01:10:03,371 --> 01:10:05,498
5, 4...

919
01:10:05,538 --> 01:10:07,404
3, 2...

920
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:09,409
Happy 1959!

921
01:10:09,577 --> 01:10:11,545
Happy New Year
to you all!

922
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:18,518
Mm.

923
01:10:19,386 --> 01:10:20,354
Happy New Year.

924
01:10:20,388 --> 01:10:22,515
A new year, a new life,

925
01:10:22,523 --> 01:10:23,489
or so they say.

926
01:10:23,524 --> 01:10:25,492
I certainly hope so.

927
01:10:45,413 --> 01:10:46,380
Ladies and gentlemen,

928
01:10:46,413 --> 01:10:48,541
I give you the President of Cuba.

929
01:10:48,549 --> 01:10:50,517
Comrades in arms, friends.

930
01:10:52,486 --> 01:10:54,283
Happy New Year's!

931
01:10:56,590 --> 01:10:57,522
Salud!

932
01:11:05,366 --> 01:11:06,333
Why are you so unhappy?

933
01:11:08,536 --> 01:11:11,368
I'm not unhappy. I'm just sad.

934
01:11:11,538 --> 01:11:12,368
Don't be.

935
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:14,531
It's in my nature.

936
01:11:14,542 --> 01:11:15,509
Hey.

937
01:11:17,377 --> 01:11:18,504
Beauty's your nature.

938
01:11:20,514 --> 01:11:21,480
Sad can be beautiful.

939
01:11:22,350 --> 01:11:23,317
Sad, yes, but not sadness.

940
01:11:34,362 --> 01:11:35,328
Whoa, whoa. Please.

941
01:11:35,363 --> 01:11:36,330
Ladies and gentlemen,

942
01:11:36,364 --> 01:11:37,489
we have an urgent announcement.

943
01:11:38,366 --> 01:11:39,492
Batista, President Batista,

944
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:40,524
has left the country.

945
01:11:40,568 --> 01:11:41,556
He's gone forever.

946
01:11:44,438 --> 01:11:47,407
Let's celebrate a new Cuba!

947
01:11:47,541 --> 01:11:48,529
Music, maestro!

948
01:11:50,578 --> 01:11:52,546
Hold it! Hey!
Hey, hey, come on!

949
01:11:55,583 --> 01:11:56,550
Come on, come on,
come on!

950
01:12:20,541 --> 01:12:22,509
Vive Fidel Castro!

951
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:33,616
Fidel! Fidel!

952
01:12:34,388 --> 01:12:39,286
Fidel! Fidel!

953
01:12:58,412 --> 01:13:01,540
Let us be thankful to God
for all he has given us.

954
01:13:01,549 --> 01:13:03,312
For the love we share,

955
01:13:03,417 --> 01:13:06,352
which should never
be taken for granted.

956
01:13:06,386 --> 01:13:09,413
May it flourish
and be fulfilled,

957
01:13:09,422 --> 01:13:11,391
as it is His gift to us.

958
01:13:11,425 --> 01:13:13,549
Amen.

959
01:13:54,401 --> 01:13:56,368
You seem truly happy.

960
01:13:56,370 --> 01:13:57,428
I am.

961
01:13:57,505 --> 01:13:58,493
And you?

962
01:14:00,441 --> 01:14:02,409
Me?

963
01:14:03,577 --> 01:14:05,340
I love you.

964
01:14:05,379 --> 01:14:06,437
And I you.

965
01:14:11,417 --> 01:14:12,510
I had a dream.

966
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:13,487
What was it about?

967
01:14:14,321 --> 01:14:15,480
Us.

968
01:14:15,523 --> 01:14:16,489
Luis was there.

969
01:14:16,590 --> 01:14:18,386
What did he say?

970
01:14:18,492 --> 01:14:20,460
He said he was okay.

971
01:14:24,431 --> 01:14:25,556
What do you think?

972
01:14:28,536 --> 01:14:30,367
You really love me.

973
01:14:33,474 --> 01:14:34,532
Like I said.

974
01:14:35,542 --> 01:14:37,511
Say it to me.

975
01:14:37,511 --> 01:14:39,308
Say it again.

976
01:14:39,413 --> 01:14:41,346
Like I said?

977
01:14:53,527 --> 01:14:54,585
I love you.

978
01:15:34,468 --> 01:15:37,493
Watch them closely.

979
01:15:39,473 --> 01:15:41,337
I would be the only
person in Havana

980
01:15:41,508 --> 01:15:43,339
man enough to turn
my back on him.

981
01:15:43,377 --> 01:15:45,345
Hey, come on.

982
01:15:45,379 --> 01:15:49,337
A peeping Tom in reverse.

983
01:15:49,383 --> 01:15:51,510
When all the others are
watching the bearded Godiva,

984
01:15:51,518 --> 01:15:53,509
I will avert my eyes.

985
01:15:54,355 --> 01:15:56,323
Look how happy everybody is.

986
01:15:59,426 --> 01:16:02,361
Everyone is alike in jubilation.

987
01:16:02,529 --> 01:16:04,520
Only suffering makes them different.

988
01:16:28,455 --> 01:16:29,513
I'm need to see your cells.

989
01:16:30,391 --> 01:16:31,517
Cells? What cells?

990
01:16:33,394 --> 01:16:35,362
I have a friend in the cells.

991
01:16:35,362 --> 01:16:36,294
Attention!

992
01:16:38,332 --> 01:16:41,301
When a superior officer
approaches you,

993
01:16:41,335 --> 01:16:43,303
you stand at attention.
Is that understood?

994
01:16:43,337 --> 01:16:44,497
Yes, comrade.

995
01:16:44,571 --> 01:16:46,435
At ease.

996
01:16:53,547 --> 01:16:55,377
I need to talk to you.

997
01:17:01,455 --> 01:17:02,581
What's the matter with you?

998
01:17:02,589 --> 01:17:04,420
You've been here all this time,

999
01:17:04,458 --> 01:17:05,583
and you haven't
come see your family?

1000
01:17:05,592 --> 01:17:06,559
What do you need?

1001
01:17:06,592 --> 01:17:08,424
What do I need?

1002
01:17:10,431 --> 01:17:11,398
What?

1003
01:17:11,598 --> 01:17:13,565
I can't touch you?

1004
01:17:14,435 --> 01:17:16,562
Castel is in here.
He's in a cell. I need to see him.

1005
01:17:17,438 --> 01:17:18,564
There are no cells, Fico.

1006
01:17:18,605 --> 01:17:20,435
There's only the cage.

1007
01:17:22,609 --> 01:17:24,440
Take me to him.

1008
01:17:25,612 --> 01:17:26,578
Take me to him.

1009
01:17:26,613 --> 01:17:28,444
Don't fuck around.

1010
01:17:28,449 --> 01:17:29,574
Take me to see him right now.

1011
01:17:29,616 --> 01:17:30,583
As you wish.

1012
01:17:33,587 --> 01:17:36,422
Brauilo!

1013
01:17:36,457 --> 01:17:37,424
Hmm?

1014
01:17:37,458 --> 01:17:38,425
Braulio.

1015
01:17:40,461 --> 01:17:41,587
Come here. Come here.

1016
01:17:41,595 --> 01:17:42,562
Fico.

1017
01:17:42,596 --> 01:17:43,563
Fico, Fico.

1018
01:17:47,601 --> 01:17:49,431
Oh, you don't look
so tough now.

1019
01:17:51,438 --> 01:17:53,406
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. I'm here.

1020
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:54,565
It's okay.

1021
01:17:55,442 --> 01:17:56,409
It's okay. It's okay.

1022
01:17:56,443 --> 01:17:57,410
Get me out of here.

1023
01:17:57,444 --> 01:17:59,412
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1024
01:18:00,614 --> 01:18:02,444
I'm not...

1025
01:18:03,617 --> 01:18:05,448
I'm not an animal.

1026
01:18:05,452 --> 01:18:10,583
I deserve...
a proper jail.

1027
01:18:10,591 --> 01:18:12,559
Well, you built it, we didn't.

1028
01:18:12,592 --> 01:18:15,426
Listen to me. I

1029
01:18:15,462 --> 01:18:18,590
I'm not innocent, okay?

1030
01:18:18,599 --> 01:18:20,567
But I never killed anybody.

1031
01:18:20,601 --> 01:18:22,569
You just like to pull
people's eyes out

1032
01:18:22,603 --> 01:18:24,571
and their teeth and fingernails
and piss on them.

1033
01:18:24,571 --> 01:18:25,538
He saved your life!

1034
01:18:25,572 --> 01:18:27,540
That was to sell you a favor!

1035
01:18:27,574 --> 01:18:29,542
That's a lie.
You know it.

1036
01:18:32,446 --> 01:18:34,573
He's lying. He's lying.

1037
01:18:34,581 --> 01:18:36,515
It's okay.
Let me handle it.

1038
01:18:37,384 --> 01:18:38,510
Look at me.

1039
01:18:38,551 --> 01:18:40,382
Look at me.
Look at me.

1040
01:18:40,386 --> 01:18:42,355
I'm gonna take care of this.

1041
01:18:42,389 --> 01:18:44,357
I believe in you.

1042
01:18:46,359 --> 01:18:47,486
You came back.

1043
01:19:05,612 --> 01:19:07,580
Let's go.
He'll see you now.

1044
01:19:19,493 --> 01:19:21,461
So you're the dancer.

1045
01:19:23,330 --> 01:19:25,355
Che, I'm here
to inquire about a

1046
01:19:25,465 --> 01:19:27,592
My name is Comandante Guevara.

1047
01:19:27,601 --> 01:19:29,466
I'm Che only to my comrades.

1048
01:19:29,502 --> 01:19:31,333
What can I do for you?

1049
01:19:31,471 --> 01:19:33,529
My brother spoke to you
about a friend of mine,

1050
01:19:33,574 --> 01:19:34,541
Captain Castel.

1051
01:19:34,574 --> 01:19:36,406
Formerly a captain.
What about him?

1052
01:19:36,542 --> 01:19:38,373
He's detained here.

1053
01:19:38,377 --> 01:19:39,572
No longer.

1054
01:19:42,583 --> 01:19:44,380
He's been freed?

1055
01:19:44,518 --> 01:19:46,509
In a way.

1056
01:19:46,553 --> 01:19:48,384
What do you mean?

1057
01:19:48,388 --> 01:19:50,480
You know what
La Rouchefoucauld said about life?

1058
01:19:50,556 --> 01:19:54,323
There are two things
in life we cannot face

1059
01:19:54,428 --> 01:19:55,520
the sun and death.

1060
01:19:56,363 --> 01:19:58,489
Here we give people
a chance to face both.

1061
01:20:00,367 --> 01:20:02,562
We shot your friend
early this morning.

1062
01:20:11,478 --> 01:20:13,446
Why do you bother with such scum?

1063
01:20:15,415 --> 01:20:16,507
Why?

1064
01:20:20,354 --> 01:20:23,482
Look, go to your cabaret

1065
01:20:23,523 --> 01:20:25,491
and entertain the rich.

1066
01:20:36,569 --> 01:20:37,502
Let's go, Fico.

1067
01:20:45,412 --> 01:20:46,344
Go.

1068
01:20:55,422 --> 01:20:57,413
Cha-cha-cha!

1069
01:20:57,457 --> 01:20:58,424
Va.

1070
01:20:59,458 --> 01:21:01,426
Va. Muy bien.

1071
01:21:03,462 --> 01:21:04,555
Va.

1072
01:21:05,364 --> 01:21:08,501
Hold it. Hold it.

1073
01:21:08,535 --> 01:21:10,366
It's too military.

1074
01:21:12,372 --> 01:21:14,498
All right, girls,
lose the rifles.

1075
01:21:15,509 --> 01:21:18,342
Very, very unmilitary now.

1076
01:21:18,478 --> 01:21:19,308
M? Sica.

1077
01:21:19,513 --> 01:21:20,480
1, 2, 3.

1078
01:21:24,484 --> 01:21:26,452
Stop the music!

1079
01:21:26,586 --> 01:21:28,451
Stop that music!

1080
01:21:30,524 --> 01:21:31,513
Who are you?

1081
01:21:31,558 --> 01:21:33,549
I am Zoraida Munoz,

1082
01:21:33,592 --> 01:21:35,424
a delegate for
the musicians' union.

1083
01:21:35,529 --> 01:21:37,394
What authority do you have
to stop my rehearsal?

1084
01:21:37,531 --> 01:21:40,523
The government gave me the
authority.

1085
01:21:40,534 --> 01:21:42,502
See, you own this beautiful cabaret,

1086
01:21:42,536 --> 01:21:43,502
but we own the orchestra.

1087
01:21:44,337 --> 01:21:45,395
Really?

1088
01:21:45,471 --> 01:21:48,305
Really. If I tell the orchestra
not to play,

1089
01:21:48,408 --> 01:21:49,534
they can't play.

1090
01:21:49,542 --> 01:21:51,373
Is that so?

1091
01:21:51,411 --> 01:21:53,538
Fico, we're in the union.

1092
01:21:53,547 --> 01:21:54,479
They control the union.

1093
01:21:56,315 --> 01:21:58,409
I see. And under what
grounds do you have

1094
01:21:58,452 --> 01:22:00,578
to come here and stop my show?

1095
01:22:00,587 --> 01:22:02,417
You just can't use the saxophone

1096
01:22:02,456 --> 01:22:03,547
in the orchestra anymore.

1097
01:22:03,623 --> 01:22:05,318
Come again?

1098
01:22:05,425 --> 01:22:07,586
The saxophone is a instrument
of the imperialists.

1099
01:22:07,594 --> 01:22:10,563
The saxophone was invented

1100
01:22:10,596 --> 01:22:13,430
by a man named Sax in Belgium!

1101
01:22:13,433 --> 01:22:17,391
Do you know what
the Belgian imperialists

1102
01:22:17,437 --> 01:22:18,563
are doing in the Congo?

1103
01:22:18,572 --> 01:22:20,403
They're a bunch of murderers.

1104
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:21,407
You don't say.

1105
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:22,567
No, I do say!

1106
01:22:22,576 --> 01:22:24,407
And I am saying

1107
01:22:24,444 --> 01:22:26,412
that if you want
the orchestra to play,

1108
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:28,547
then you have to go
without the saxophone.

1109
01:22:29,449 --> 01:22:31,382
Otherwise, I will stop the show.

1110
01:22:56,443 --> 01:22:57,273
Great show.

1111
01:22:57,477 --> 01:23:00,301
What's wrong with it?

1112
01:23:00,346 --> 01:23:01,439
You mean besides the fact

1113
01:23:01,448 --> 01:23:03,416
that they executed my friend
in two days without due process?

1114
01:23:03,417 --> 01:23:05,544
And now they're threatening
to close down my club

1115
01:23:05,585 --> 01:23:08,554
because we can't use
saxophones in the orchestra.

1116
01:23:08,555 --> 01:23:10,580
Saxophones!

1117
01:23:12,458 --> 01:23:14,324
Besides that?

1118
01:23:16,328 --> 01:23:18,354
What about the pigeons?

1119
01:23:18,431 --> 01:23:19,421
The pigeon.

1120
01:23:19,466 --> 01:23:21,434
Never work with pigeons.

1121
01:23:22,301 --> 01:23:23,428
Guano.

1122
01:23:23,470 --> 01:23:25,404
Well, at least
we don't have to deal

1123
01:23:25,404 --> 01:23:27,532
with the likes
of Meyer Lansky anymore.

1124
01:23:27,541 --> 01:23:28,473
Maybe worse.

1125
01:23:29,309 --> 01:23:31,538
Here's to a Cuba libre.

1126
01:23:31,578 --> 01:23:34,411
Well, what do we do now?

1127
01:23:35,382 --> 01:23:37,282
Let's go to Hernando's.

1128
01:23:37,384 --> 01:23:39,511
Hernando's Hideaway.

1129
01:23:40,319 --> 01:23:41,480
Now, that has a certain ring to it.

1130
01:23:44,524 --> 01:23:45,513
I'm going.

1131
01:23:45,559 --> 01:23:47,390
I'm going,

1132
01:23:47,394 --> 01:23:51,296
which translates
to I'm not going.

1133
01:24:22,596 --> 01:24:24,564
Dance with me.

1134
01:25:59,391 --> 01:26:00,484
What's wrong?

1135
01:26:06,565 --> 01:26:07,498
What's happening?

1136
01:26:08,301 --> 01:26:09,359
Viva el suerte de Fidel.

1137
01:26:13,506 --> 01:26:15,337
Viva Fidel!

1138
01:26:17,510 --> 01:26:19,478
It's Fidel.

1139
01:26:19,511 --> 01:26:23,311
The guy we saw performing
with a pigeon once.

1140
01:26:23,350 --> 01:26:25,443
Let's go over.
I want to meet him.

1141
01:26:26,319 --> 01:26:27,444
Too early in the day
for that.

1142
01:26:27,587 --> 01:26:29,452
There are some things
I need to say.

1143
01:26:29,456 --> 01:26:30,547
I want to speak with him.

1144
01:26:31,391 --> 01:26:33,382
Will you please take me?

1145
01:26:33,393 --> 01:26:34,451
What?

1146
01:26:34,527 --> 01:26:36,494
There are some things
I need to say.

1147
01:26:36,496 --> 01:26:37,554
Would you please take me?

1148
01:26:39,431 --> 01:26:40,558
No.

1149
01:26:41,368 --> 01:26:42,528
I'll go on my own, then.

1150
01:27:12,599 --> 01:27:15,363
Fidel's inviting us
to have breakfast with him.

1151
01:27:15,368 --> 01:27:16,561
He invited you, not me.

1152
01:27:16,603 --> 01:27:19,367
I don't think it's
proper for me to turn him down.

1153
01:27:19,471 --> 01:27:22,338
Well, I don't think
it's proper for me to wait around.

1154
01:27:25,444 --> 01:27:26,412
You're jealous.

1155
01:27:26,413 --> 01:27:29,382
Of a circus ringmaster?

1156
01:27:29,549 --> 01:27:30,516
You don't know me.

1157
01:27:30,516 --> 01:27:32,542
I thought
you never paid?

1158
01:27:32,585 --> 01:27:35,520
I always pay sooner or later.

1159
01:28:10,323 --> 01:28:10,583
Cecilia?

1160
01:28:10,590 --> 01:28:12,524
Yes, dear.

1161
01:28:13,359 --> 01:28:15,351
Was that Ricardo
at the door?

1162
01:28:15,362 --> 01:28:17,556
No, no. They had
the wrong house.

1163
01:28:18,331 --> 01:28:19,422
Oh.

1164
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:35,310
Aurora.

1165
01:28:35,315 --> 01:28:36,440
Or should I say
companera?

1166
01:28:37,317 --> 01:28:40,286
Fidel sends his regard and
admiration.

1167
01:28:40,319 --> 01:28:42,288
He regrets that
he couldn't be here

1168
01:28:42,322 --> 01:28:43,448
to greet you personally.

1169
01:28:43,489 --> 01:28:45,320
He sent me in his place

1170
01:28:45,324 --> 01:28:47,452
to offer you something
of great importance.

1171
01:28:48,328 --> 01:28:49,453
Good news and bad news.

1172
01:28:49,462 --> 01:28:51,292
Somebody I know?

1173
01:28:51,331 --> 01:28:52,592
Somebody you don't know.

1174
01:28:53,366 --> 01:28:55,357
Aurora Bernal de Fellove,

1175
01:28:55,402 --> 01:28:57,336
a widow of a martyr
of the revolution

1176
01:28:57,436 --> 01:28:58,426
Luis Fellove, who was killed

1177
01:28:58,570 --> 01:29:01,404
in the massacre on Humboldt Street.

1178
01:29:01,408 --> 01:29:03,376
After his heroic exploits

1179
01:29:03,576 --> 01:29:06,409
during the assault
on the Presidential Palace.

1180
01:29:06,578 --> 01:29:09,547
Comrade Aurora has been named

1181
01:29:09,582 --> 01:29:11,550
widow of the Revolution
of the Year.

1182
01:29:12,418 --> 01:29:14,386
Nice writers they have
down here, huh?

1183
01:29:14,421 --> 01:29:15,547
Widow of the Revolution.

1184
01:29:15,587 --> 01:29:17,418
Does that mean

1185
01:29:17,424 --> 01:29:19,391
she was formerly married
to the revolution,

1186
01:29:19,426 --> 01:29:22,520
and now the aforementioned
revolution is dead?

1187
01:29:22,561 --> 01:29:25,359
And did that happen
this year, too?

1188
01:29:25,364 --> 01:29:26,491
And the copy

1189
01:29:27,367 --> 01:29:29,493
even I can write
better than that.

1190
01:29:29,536 --> 01:29:31,503
But...

1191
01:29:32,372 --> 01:29:34,498
it does suggest...

1192
01:29:34,541 --> 01:29:36,532
heads up now

1193
01:29:36,542 --> 01:29:39,478
The Merry widow
of the Revolution

1194
01:29:39,511 --> 01:29:42,480
some songs,
a little bit of business.

1195
01:29:43,349 --> 01:29:44,475
Very nice musical
you could open

1196
01:29:44,484 --> 01:29:46,452
right here in Fico's Palace.

1197
01:29:48,354 --> 01:29:49,582
I'd like to run
with this one if I could.

1198
01:29:50,457 --> 01:29:52,516
I'm gonna go see if I ca

1199
01:29:52,525 --> 01:29:53,492
n nail down the rights.

1200
01:29:58,597 --> 01:29:59,565
Hello.

1201
01:29:59,599 --> 01:30:01,362
Hello, Fico.

1202
01:30:01,434 --> 01:30:03,425
You haven't called me.

1203
01:30:03,536 --> 01:30:05,527
I had work to do.

1204
01:30:06,372 --> 01:30:07,360
You've just disappeared.

1205
01:30:07,407 --> 01:30:09,341
I missed you.

1206
01:30:09,442 --> 01:30:11,501
Work to do.

1207
01:30:11,610 --> 01:30:13,476
Have you seen it
in the papers?

1208
01:30:13,579 --> 01:30:15,547
Isn't it wonderful?

1209
01:30:17,550 --> 01:30:19,381
Yes, I'm glad to hear it.

1210
01:30:19,485 --> 01:30:21,453
Luis should be so proud.

1211
01:30:21,587 --> 01:30:22,577
Right.

1212
01:30:23,422 --> 01:30:25,413
The reason I called you
is to invite you

1213
01:30:25,425 --> 01:30:27,551
to a little celebration in my honor.

1214
01:30:28,427 --> 01:30:29,520
Would you please come?

1215
01:30:30,329 --> 01:30:32,297
Maybe some other time.
Listen, I have to go.

1216
01:30:32,398 --> 01:30:33,386
All right.

1217
01:30:33,565 --> 01:30:35,534
Please call me.

1218
01:30:35,534 --> 01:30:37,560
I love you.

1219
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:50,439
Once more into the breach.

1220
01:30:54,554 --> 01:30:55,417
What can I do for you?

1221
01:30:55,555 --> 01:30:57,420
We're closing down
this cabaret

1222
01:30:57,422 --> 01:30:59,391
on account of gambling.

1223
01:30:59,458 --> 01:31:00,448
Gambling.

1224
01:31:00,592 --> 01:31:02,424
Illegal gambling.

1225
01:31:02,494 --> 01:31:03,359
What illegal gambling?

1226
01:31:03,496 --> 01:31:06,590
We caught two stagehands
playing cards.

1227
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:08,367
And that's illegal.

1228
01:31:08,467 --> 01:31:10,333
Oh, it's worse than that.

1229
01:31:10,336 --> 01:31:12,304
It is a dangerous
distraction to the masses.

1230
01:31:12,438 --> 01:31:15,430
The opium of the people,
Marx said.

1231
01:31:15,608 --> 01:31:18,577
I thought Marx said religion
was the opiate of the people.

1232
01:31:19,412 --> 01:31:20,378
Marx said that, too.

1233
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:22,345
Karl or Groucho?

1234
01:31:23,416 --> 01:31:26,408
Also an illegal gambling game.

1235
01:31:26,452 --> 01:31:27,418
The revolutionary government

1236
01:31:27,453 --> 01:31:29,421
will decide when, how,

1237
01:31:29,556 --> 01:31:34,391
and if this premises
will be functioning again.

1238
01:31:36,496 --> 01:31:39,556
You son of a bitch!
How dare you?

1239
01:31:42,569 --> 01:31:44,332
I'm an artist!

1240
01:31:44,404 --> 01:31:46,372
Puta! Cono!

1241
01:31:46,506 --> 01:31:48,497
Likewise.

1242
01:33:04,384 --> 01:33:07,511
Hello!
My nephew the hero!

1243
01:33:09,389 --> 01:33:11,357
Good to see you.

1244
01:33:11,391 --> 01:33:12,483
My goodness.

1245
01:33:22,435 --> 01:33:24,561
There's nothing
like an old Victrola.

1246
01:33:25,438 --> 01:33:29,340
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

1247
01:33:29,375 --> 01:33:31,502
I was just about
to make my rounds.

1248
01:33:31,511 --> 01:33:35,310
But first we have a drink, huh?

1249
01:33:36,449 --> 01:33:40,578
And then we'll have a walk,

1250
01:33:40,619 --> 01:33:43,588
talk, a smoke,

1251
01:33:44,390 --> 01:33:45,550
and then...

1252
01:33:47,460 --> 01:33:50,327
...we will eat, huh?

1253
01:33:50,430 --> 01:33:52,398
Ricardito.

1254
01:33:54,367 --> 01:33:55,493
Isn't this beautiful?

1255
01:33:55,501 --> 01:34:00,336
It's a little behind, yes,

1256
01:34:00,338 --> 01:34:04,332
but it shows great promise.

1257
01:34:04,377 --> 01:34:07,471
The day I die...

1258
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:10,313
all of this will be yours.

1259
01:34:10,449 --> 01:34:12,315
No, it won't.

1260
01:34:12,318 --> 01:34:15,287
Yes, it will, but after I die.

1261
01:34:15,488 --> 01:34:16,454
Ha ha.

1262
01:34:16,489 --> 01:34:19,322
You don't understand.
It belongs to the revolution.

1263
01:34:19,324 --> 01:34:22,293
The revolution will pass, believe
me.

1264
01:34:24,463 --> 01:34:28,457
I've seen it all before.

1265
01:34:28,467 --> 01:34:32,426
Menocal, Machado, Batista...

1266
01:34:33,338 --> 01:34:35,466
where are they now?

1267
01:34:38,511 --> 01:34:39,500
Gone.

1268
01:34:42,381 --> 01:34:44,474
Fidel Castro will pass, too.

1269
01:34:44,550 --> 01:34:49,351
But the land...

1270
01:34:49,387 --> 01:34:52,482
the land, it will endure.

1271
01:34:52,592 --> 01:34:55,493
Fidel Castro sent me personally

1272
01:34:55,595 --> 01:34:57,460
to take vacant
possession of this land.

1273
01:34:57,462 --> 01:34:58,395
What are you talking about?

1274
01:34:58,530 --> 01:34:59,498
I'm here too evict you.

1275
01:34:59,599 --> 01:35:03,296
Would you repeat that to me,
please?

1276
01:35:03,301 --> 01:35:04,394
This farm is now
property of the state.

1277
01:35:04,436 --> 01:35:05,529
I am here to legally inform you

1278
01:35:06,372 --> 01:35:07,463
that you must leave immediately.

1279
01:35:07,507 --> 01:35:12,467
What did you just say to me,
nephew?

1280
01:35:13,346 --> 01:35:15,472
Godson.

1281
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:17,415
My blood!

1282
01:35:17,449 --> 01:35:19,475
How dare you come to my house

1283
01:35:19,585 --> 01:35:24,284
and tell me to get out?

1284
01:35:24,323 --> 01:35:27,451
Have you no shame?

1285
01:35:28,327 --> 01:35:30,453
You really think
I'm going to leave my house?

1286
01:35:30,462 --> 01:35:33,489
My land?

1287
01:35:34,333 --> 01:35:38,326
I have worked this earth
too hard with my bare hands

1288
01:35:38,337 --> 01:35:40,305
to let some fidelistas
take it from me!

1289
01:35:40,405 --> 01:35:41,395
Listen, you have to understand,

1290
01:35:41,574 --> 01:35:42,563
this is
the future now.

1291
01:35:42,574 --> 01:35:43,542
The future?

1292
01:35:43,576 --> 01:35:45,305
Yes, the future.

1293
01:35:45,411 --> 01:35:46,570
Piss on your future!

1294
01:35:46,612 --> 01:35:50,309
I spit on your future!

1295
01:35:50,449 --> 01:35:52,440
Let them try and take it.

1296
01:35:52,484 --> 01:35:55,453
You just let them try!

1297
01:35:57,456 --> 01:35:58,582
Take it easy.

1298
01:35:58,591 --> 01:36:00,422
Where is your sense of

1299
01:36:00,458 --> 01:36:02,586
ohh! Aah...

1300
01:36:02,595 --> 01:36:03,561
ohh...

1301
01:36:04,396 --> 01:36:06,558
where is your sense of

1302
01:36:06,565 --> 01:36:07,533
Are you okay?

1303
01:36:07,567 --> 01:36:09,501
...family?

1304
01:36:14,440 --> 01:36:17,375
Help! Help!

1305
01:36:17,376 --> 01:36:18,467
Dono, put your head up.

1306
01:36:18,511 --> 01:36:20,479
Put your head up.
Put your head

1307
01:36:20,512 --> 01:36:23,346
Help me! Help!

1308
01:36:27,353 --> 01:36:30,480
Help! Help!

1309
01:36:38,597 --> 01:36:40,565
Hello, Father.

1310
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:42,568
Hi, son.

1311
01:36:44,569 --> 01:36:50,405
What a great thing to hear.

1312
01:36:50,409 --> 01:36:53,537
No one comes to say hello these
days.

1313
01:36:54,413 --> 01:36:56,381
Just good-bye.

1314
01:37:00,485 --> 01:37:01,578
I'm so sorry.

1315
01:37:01,587 --> 01:37:04,488
Yeah, well...

1316
01:37:04,523 --> 01:37:06,422
my brother's resting in peace,

1317
01:37:06,592 --> 01:37:12,359
and Ricardo, unfortunately...

1318
01:37:12,530 --> 01:37:15,556
will have to live with
the consequences of his actions.

1319
01:37:15,568 --> 01:37:20,301
And that's very sad.

1320
01:37:20,306 --> 01:37:23,275
But, uh...

1321
01:37:23,476 --> 01:37:26,444
I would like to talk about you.

1322
01:37:27,313 --> 01:37:28,541
I remember what you said
about the moneylenders in the temple.

1323
01:37:28,581 --> 01:37:30,412
Yeah.

1324
01:37:30,416 --> 01:37:34,318
Well, the self-proclaimed
Christ is here,

1325
01:37:34,319 --> 01:37:35,287
and he's all whip.

1326
01:37:35,453 --> 01:37:36,511
I know.

1327
01:37:37,323 --> 01:37:39,484
Federico.

1328
01:37:41,493 --> 01:37:43,324
Yeah.

1329
01:37:43,496 --> 01:37:48,592
Your mother and I...
are worried about you.

1330
01:37:48,601 --> 01:37:51,569
Now we think you should be
leaving the country.

1331
01:37:51,569 --> 01:37:53,400
My place is here with both of you.

1332
01:37:53,439 --> 01:37:54,405
Listen to me.

1333
01:37:54,573 --> 01:37:56,507
No. I'm not gonna leave,

1334
01:37:57,376 --> 01:37:58,308
unless you're gonna come with me.

1335
01:37:58,344 --> 01:38:00,311
Listen to me.

1336
01:38:00,479 --> 01:38:03,538
Listen to me.

1337
01:38:03,549 --> 01:38:08,452
In life, you have
to know when to arrive,

1338
01:38:09,322 --> 01:38:11,516
but you have to know when to leave.

1339
01:38:13,492 --> 01:38:16,324
And you should be leaving to a
place

1340
01:38:16,328 --> 01:38:19,297
where you can express yourself
freely,

1341
01:38:19,332 --> 01:38:21,458
not like here.

1342
01:38:24,403 --> 01:38:26,564
And this will fill
our hearts with hope.

1343
01:38:27,373 --> 01:38:31,366
We'll be fine, Fico.
We'll be fine.

1344
01:38:40,519 --> 01:38:43,317
I have left you very little, my son.

1345
01:38:43,355 --> 01:38:45,449
How can you say that?

1346
01:38:45,491 --> 01:38:47,458
You've given me
the wealth of your example.

1347
01:38:47,460 --> 01:38:49,427
That's all I need.

1348
01:38:51,564 --> 01:38:56,467
Remember that the future of
our familys with you.

1349
01:39:01,340 --> 01:39:04,467
You know... in Cuba,

1350
01:39:04,476 --> 01:39:07,502
we have always
had plenty of light.

1351
01:39:12,518 --> 01:39:16,351
We have never had darkness
at noon before.

1352
01:39:23,362 --> 01:39:26,331
You are my pride and my joy.

1353
01:39:33,538 --> 01:39:35,529
I'm going to do
something I did to you

1354
01:39:35,541 --> 01:39:37,509
when you were a little boy.

1355
01:39:38,411 --> 01:39:39,502
This.

1356
01:39:45,351 --> 01:39:46,318
Nothing there, huh?

1357
01:39:46,351 --> 01:39:49,317
I'm sorry.

1358
01:41:33,324 --> 01:41:34,484
How could you?

1359
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:36,527
Look at me!

1360
01:41:57,449 --> 01:42:02,476
What has become of you, Ricardo?

1361
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:05,547
You betray your country.

1362
01:42:05,558 --> 01:42:10,324
You disgraced your family.

1363
01:42:15,501 --> 01:42:17,594
You are lost, my son.

1364
01:42:21,507 --> 01:42:24,476
Yes, you are.

1365
01:42:39,558 --> 01:42:41,389
Fico

1366
01:43:12,491 --> 01:43:14,550
I wish I could go back to the beginning.

1367
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:17,393
Mmm, I love beginnings.

1368
01:43:17,563 --> 01:43:18,530
Why's that?

1369
01:43:18,564 --> 01:43:20,532
Nothing's happened yet.

1370
01:43:20,566 --> 01:43:24,525
Anticipation is
in the air. Optimism.

1371
01:43:29,475 --> 01:43:31,409
What about the end?

1372
01:43:31,510 --> 01:43:34,308
Well, they don't
call it the end for nothing.

1373
01:43:34,413 --> 01:43:37,348
I hate endings...

1374
01:43:37,449 --> 01:43:39,440
unless, of course,
your end is your beginning,

1375
01:43:39,451 --> 01:43:42,284
which makes
your beginning your end.

1376
01:43:42,321 --> 01:43:44,414
Then I would love the end.

1377
01:43:44,523 --> 01:43:47,424
Where are we now?

1378
01:43:48,327 --> 01:43:51,421
If you don't know where you are,

1379
01:43:51,430 --> 01:43:53,455
then you are in the middle.

1380
01:43:53,599 --> 01:43:55,464
No doubt about that.

1381
01:45:21,319 --> 01:45:23,515
There goes my swing vote.

1382
01:45:30,562 --> 01:45:34,362
Friends, I have an important
announcement to make.

1383
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:37,435
There's no dessert.

1384
01:45:39,471 --> 01:45:42,440
Food rationing.

1385
01:45:42,441 --> 01:45:43,533
Would you mind?

1386
01:45:48,414 --> 01:45:53,283
And now a few brief words
from the man with no name?

1387
01:45:53,318 --> 01:45:54,580
I'll be brief.

1388
01:45:59,591 --> 01:46:03,425
Ladies and gentlemen...

1389
01:46:05,564 --> 01:46:09,398
our Federico
Fellove is going away for good.

1390
01:46:09,435 --> 01:46:11,528
Being a writer, I stress
the word good

1391
01:46:11,537 --> 01:46:14,370
because I think it will
be good for him...

1392
01:46:14,373 --> 01:46:17,365
and good for us, too.

1393
01:46:17,376 --> 01:46:20,345
Fico is going
to New York City...

1394
01:46:20,546 --> 01:46:23,515
the Mecca of show business...

1395
01:46:23,549 --> 01:46:25,517
where I'm gonna be headin'
for eventually.

1396
01:46:28,353 --> 01:46:30,480
Fico,
I know you're gonna be there

1397
01:46:30,489 --> 01:46:32,319
to welcome us with open arms

1398
01:46:32,357 --> 01:46:36,316
as you have so many
times in the past.

1399
01:46:49,441 --> 01:46:51,375
Ladies and gentlemen...

1400
01:46:51,510 --> 01:46:53,569
the writer,
for the first time, speechless.

1401
01:46:56,482 --> 01:46:59,315
I'll bail you out.

1402
01:46:59,484 --> 01:47:00,452
I'd like to say something.

1403
01:47:01,319 --> 01:47:02,548
Please.

1404
01:47:08,393 --> 01:47:11,328
I wanna say that this, uh...

1405
01:47:11,330 --> 01:47:14,560
this moment here means
a great deal to me...

1406
01:47:14,600 --> 01:47:17,535
and I'm gonna treasure this forever.

1407
01:47:22,341 --> 01:47:23,433
Salud.

1408
01:47:27,412 --> 01:47:31,314
Forever is a very long time, Fico.

1409
01:47:38,323 --> 01:47:40,291
It's all right.
He's with me.

1410
01:47:57,342 --> 01:47:59,310
Would you like a drink?

1411
01:47:59,344 --> 01:48:00,572
No, I'm driving.

1412
01:48:00,612 --> 01:48:03,410
I thought you came in a taxi.

1413
01:48:03,415 --> 01:48:05,383
I'm driving the taxi.

1414
01:48:05,417 --> 01:48:06,542
Very funny.

1415
01:48:06,551 --> 01:48:08,383
Most things are these days.

1416
01:48:08,420 --> 01:48:10,547
I need to speak to you alone.

1417
01:48:23,435 --> 01:48:26,404
I have an exit visa.

1418
01:48:26,405 --> 01:48:27,463
I'm leaving.

1419
01:48:27,506 --> 01:48:30,339
What did you say?
You heard what I said.

1420
01:48:30,342 --> 01:48:32,401
I'm leaving the country.

1421
01:48:32,611 --> 01:48:34,545
I want you to come with me.

1422
01:48:35,380 --> 01:48:36,347
To go where?

1423
01:48:36,381 --> 01:48:38,440
Anywhere but here.
It doesn't matter.

1424
01:48:38,450 --> 01:48:39,576
We can start again.

1425
01:48:40,419 --> 01:48:44,287
Fico, I have a duty to my country.

1426
01:48:44,323 --> 01:48:46,382
It is what Luis died for.

1427
01:48:46,425 --> 01:48:50,452
Luis Luis died for Cuba.
He didn't die for Fidel.

1428
01:48:54,299 --> 01:48:57,359
For the first time in my life,

1429
01:48:57,402 --> 01:48:59,461
I feel I'm part
of something important.

1430
01:49:02,341 --> 01:49:05,310
I feel I can make a difference.

1431
01:49:05,477 --> 01:49:07,411
We're fighting the just cause.

1432
01:49:07,578 --> 01:49:09,410
In a ruthless
and undemocratic manner.

1433
01:49:09,448 --> 01:49:11,575
We have to make
our reforms first.

1434
01:49:11,583 --> 01:49:13,380
Democracy will come later.

1435
01:49:13,417 --> 01:49:14,544
Then why not
the other way around?

1436
01:49:15,420 --> 01:49:16,478
I don't want to argue with you.

1437
01:49:16,520 --> 01:49:19,422
Never you.

1438
01:49:19,458 --> 01:49:22,518
Why don't you give us a chance?

1439
01:49:22,527 --> 01:49:25,462
Us? Us as in us?

1440
01:49:25,464 --> 01:49:27,523
Or us as in you
and the cause calibre?

1441
01:49:27,566 --> 01:49:29,363
Don't be angry with me.

1442
01:49:29,401 --> 01:49:32,495
No, anger would be too simple.

1443
01:49:32,537 --> 01:49:34,368
You must know that I love you.

1444
01:49:35,474 --> 01:49:37,442
That's the complicated part.

1445
01:49:38,477 --> 01:49:40,308
I'm sorry, Senora Fellove.

1446
01:49:40,345 --> 01:49:43,405
The Commandante Guevara and
the Soviet ambassador want to see you.

1447
01:49:43,415 --> 01:49:46,316
It seems urgent.

1448
01:49:47,486 --> 01:49:49,420
Please stay.

1449
01:49:49,421 --> 01:49:51,446
Why do you have to leave?

1450
01:49:51,490 --> 01:49:53,321
Please.

1451
01:50:14,546 --> 01:50:17,515
Miss Fellove,
this is the Soviet ambassador.

1452
01:50:19,518 --> 01:50:21,349
That is all you're ever gonna get.

1453
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:23,488
What?
It's not included in the deal?

1454
01:50:23,522 --> 01:50:25,490
Yes.

1455
01:50:25,490 --> 01:50:27,321
Let's go. Come on.
Let's go.

1456
01:50:27,492 --> 01:50:30,461
What are you doing?

1457
01:50:31,363 --> 01:50:32,489
You're embarrassing me.

1458
01:50:32,497 --> 01:50:34,465
This gathering is an embarrassment.

1459
01:50:34,499 --> 01:50:36,330
Get your hands off me.

1460
01:50:36,368 --> 01:50:37,335
Get you hands off me!

1461
01:50:37,368 --> 01:50:38,336
Take your hands off me.

1462
01:50:38,370 --> 01:50:39,496
You have something to say?

1463
01:50:41,406 --> 01:50:43,465
Comrade...

1464
01:50:43,575 --> 01:50:46,408
the dance floor is yours.

1465
01:50:57,589 --> 01:51:01,389
To Luis Fellove...

1466
01:51:01,426 --> 01:51:04,395
who died for a dream,

1467
01:51:04,429 --> 01:51:07,557
a dream of a pluralistic
and democratic Cuba!

1468
01:51:11,403 --> 01:51:13,564
Long live a free Cuba.

1469
01:51:22,447 --> 01:51:23,414
Let's go.

1470
01:51:26,518 --> 01:51:28,383
Long live a free Cuba.

1471
01:51:28,386 --> 01:51:30,354
Long live a free Cuba.

1472
01:51:33,325 --> 01:51:34,451
Fico, wait.

1473
01:51:34,493 --> 01:51:35,551
I can't leave.

1474
01:51:35,560 --> 01:51:39,496
We must leave before
it's too late to get out.

1475
01:51:40,398 --> 01:51:41,524
Try and understand.

1476
01:51:41,533 --> 01:51:43,364
Try to understand?

1477
01:51:43,401 --> 01:51:48,304
I understand that I'm
lost without you.

1478
01:51:48,306 --> 01:51:49,398
This is bigger than us.

1479
01:51:49,441 --> 01:51:51,500
There is nothing bigger than us.

1480
01:51:52,377 --> 01:51:54,310
Listen to me.

1481
01:51:54,446 --> 01:51:57,438
Can't you see what's happening?

1482
01:51:57,582 --> 01:52:00,415
You're being taken advantage of.

1483
01:52:00,452 --> 01:52:02,420
Is that what you want?

1484
01:52:02,453 --> 01:52:05,548
You want to be told what to think
the rest of your life?

1485
01:52:05,557 --> 01:52:09,357
Because there's no end to this.

1486
01:52:09,394 --> 01:52:12,420
This is madness.

1487
01:52:12,531 --> 01:52:14,499
You deserve more.
We deserve more.

1488
01:52:18,435 --> 01:52:22,304
If you stay, your life
will not belong to you.

1489
01:52:23,575 --> 01:52:25,372
Please.

1490
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:30,414
Come with me.

1491
01:52:39,591 --> 01:52:41,559
Please.

1492
01:52:44,563 --> 01:52:46,531
We're all that's left
of our family.

1493
01:52:50,569 --> 01:52:52,400
In time, you'll understand.

1494
01:52:52,437 --> 01:52:54,405
There's no more time.

1495
01:53:00,545 --> 01:53:02,479
Here's your exit visa.

1496
01:53:05,350 --> 01:53:08,444
I'm leaving tomorrow
at 5:00 in the afternoon.

1497
01:54:13,417 --> 01:54:14,385
Comrade, companero

1498
01:54:15,553 --> 01:54:16,577
I salute you.

1499
01:54:16,621 --> 01:54:18,486
On behalf of our maximum leader

1500
01:54:18,490 --> 01:54:21,323
and all Communists in Cuba,
welcome! Bienvenido!

1501
01:54:37,475 --> 01:54:41,411
Federico Junior.

1502
01:54:41,413 --> 01:54:44,382
I want you to have this.

1503
01:54:47,551 --> 01:54:50,385
You will need it
on the day where...

1504
01:54:50,422 --> 01:54:54,381
when what is left
of our family...

1505
01:54:54,559 --> 01:54:57,528
be reunited.

1506
01:54:57,562 --> 01:54:59,393
That's for you.
Mother and I

1507
01:54:59,431 --> 01:55:02,400
Just don't worry
because well be right here.

1508
01:55:02,400 --> 01:55:04,527
We're strong people.

1509
01:55:04,569 --> 01:55:07,402
We're gonna be right here...

1510
01:55:07,405 --> 01:55:09,532
waiting for you.

1511
01:55:09,574 --> 01:55:12,407
We'll have dinner together.

1512
01:55:12,410 --> 01:55:16,540
Uh, but what is very important...

1513
01:55:17,415 --> 01:55:19,542
At 6, okay?

1514
01:55:19,584 --> 01:55:20,551
Sharp.

1515
01:55:20,585 --> 01:55:22,553
Not a minute afterwards.

1516
01:55:22,587 --> 01:55:24,417
That's my boy.

1517
01:55:42,440 --> 01:55:45,273
Yeah. That's it.

1518
01:55:45,310 --> 01:55:50,270
There. It fits you
as well as it fits your father.

1519
01:55:50,315 --> 01:55:51,441
Are you kidding?

1520
01:55:51,449 --> 01:55:53,417
Much better.

1521
01:55:53,451 --> 01:55:54,577
Look at him.

1522
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:11,368
I'm gonna send for you
as soon as I can.

1523
01:56:14,539 --> 01:56:16,507
Bye.

1524
01:56:26,551 --> 01:56:29,384
It's all okay.

1525
01:56:43,301 --> 01:56:44,426
God bless you.

1526
01:56:53,310 --> 01:56:54,278
I gotta go.

1527
01:56:54,312 --> 01:56:55,438
Okay.

1528
01:56:58,483 --> 01:57:00,314
We'll be here.

1529
01:58:32,443 --> 01:58:33,569
Let's go!

1530
01:58:33,578 --> 01:58:34,567
Next.

1531
01:58:38,416 --> 01:58:39,383
What's in the bag?

1532
01:58:39,417 --> 01:58:40,509
Only what I need.

1533
01:58:40,518 --> 01:58:42,281
Open it.

1534
01:58:52,430 --> 01:58:54,398
Man of taste.

1535
01:58:56,401 --> 01:58:57,527
What's this?

1536
01:58:57,569 --> 01:59:00,435
Home movies.
There's my camera.

1537
01:59:00,438 --> 01:59:02,372
Open it.

1538
01:59:06,444 --> 01:59:09,504
I wanna photograph
the injustice of American life.

1539
01:59:13,451 --> 01:59:14,542
Stretch out your arms.

1540
01:59:19,357 --> 01:59:21,348
Empty your pockets.

1541
01:59:24,462 --> 01:59:27,328
Ring and watch, take them off.

1542
01:59:34,606 --> 01:59:36,437
Put it in here.

1543
01:59:36,441 --> 01:59:38,409
Sir?

1544
01:59:45,450 --> 01:59:47,417
Inside.

1545
01:59:49,386 --> 01:59:50,354
Take it off.

1546
01:59:55,526 --> 01:59:58,393
This watch belonged to my father.

1547
01:59:58,395 --> 02:00:00,364
Belonged is correct.

1548
02:00:00,398 --> 02:00:01,524
In here.

1549
02:00:04,602 --> 02:00:07,435
What's this?

1550
02:00:07,438 --> 02:00:08,405
A memento.

1551
02:00:08,439 --> 02:00:09,565
Hmm.

1552
02:00:10,408 --> 02:00:13,400
You worms are strange.

1553
02:00:13,444 --> 02:00:16,379
Not yet gone, and you're
already carrying souvenirs.

1554
02:00:18,449 --> 02:00:21,509
You can't take Cuba
with you, you know.

1555
02:00:21,586 --> 02:00:23,451
Free to go.

1556
02:00:24,489 --> 02:00:26,319
Next.

1557
02:02:15,366 --> 02:02:17,459
This is Willis Conover
of the Voice of America

1558
02:02:17,468 --> 02:02:19,435
bringing you The Music of Freedom.

1559
02:02:19,470 --> 02:02:22,303
For those of you in limbo
out there, here is the Duke

1560
02:02:22,340 --> 02:02:24,331
and saxophone
is Coleman Hawkins

1561
02:02:24,342 --> 02:02:26,469
with Limbo Jazz.

1562
02:03:11,556 --> 02:03:13,386
Who is it?

1563
02:03:13,558 --> 02:03:15,389
Room service.

1564
02:03:28,339 --> 02:03:29,465
So when did you leave?

1565
02:03:31,509 --> 02:03:34,342
Better ask
when did I escape.

1566
02:03:34,345 --> 02:03:37,405
Semantics, my friend,
is made up of antics.

1567
02:03:38,549 --> 02:03:40,517
I'm glad to see you.

1568
02:03:42,353 --> 02:03:44,321
It can only mean
that you're lonely.

1569
02:03:44,489 --> 02:03:46,582
Lonely is the best word.

1570
02:03:46,591 --> 02:03:48,559
When a man is truly lonely,

1571
02:03:48,593 --> 02:03:51,357
even a light bulb is good company.

1572
02:03:53,397 --> 02:03:56,332
Actually, I'm masquerading
as an exile.

1573
02:03:56,367 --> 02:03:58,426
Well, your impersonation
is quite good.

1574
02:03:58,435 --> 02:03:59,460
I'm still in Cuba.

1575
02:04:00,605 --> 02:04:02,573
Where do you think I am,
Jersey City?

1576
02:04:08,346 --> 02:04:10,405
Joe DiMaggio.

1577
02:04:10,448 --> 02:04:12,507
Minnie Minoso.

1578
02:04:17,488 --> 02:04:18,546
He looks in.

1579
02:04:18,589 --> 02:04:21,558
Yeah, you latched on that one.

1580
02:04:25,429 --> 02:04:27,420
Hmm, where we going?

1581
02:04:27,598 --> 02:04:28,565
El Dragon Rojo,

1582
02:04:28,599 --> 02:04:31,568
a Cuban-Chinese restaurant
which is neither.

1583
02:04:31,602 --> 02:04:34,400
But they are under
the illusion I'm a writer.

1584
02:04:34,505 --> 02:04:35,493
Madam.

1585
02:04:37,375 --> 02:04:38,342
Oh, madam.

1586
02:04:38,509 --> 02:04:40,500
What would you like today?

1587
02:04:40,511 --> 02:04:42,342
My usual please.

1588
02:04:42,513 --> 02:04:43,480
Beluga caviarto start.

1589
02:04:43,514 --> 02:04:45,482
For an entre, pheasant tongues

1590
02:04:45,516 --> 02:04:47,484
marinated in vin de sauternes.

1591
02:04:47,484 --> 02:04:48,474
Smyrna figs for dessert,

1592
02:04:49,386 --> 02:04:50,319
and a bottle of Veuve Cliquot

1593
02:04:50,354 --> 02:04:52,584
chilled, not merely cold, please.

1594
02:04:53,391 --> 02:04:55,484
Fried rice and bananas for two.

1595
02:04:55,560 --> 02:04:57,425
Yes, the special, please,
but bring it right away.

1596
02:04:57,428 --> 02:04:59,555
We haven't eaten
since the revolution.

1597
02:04:59,564 --> 02:05:03,364
Did you know that Cuba
is half white,

1598
02:05:03,467 --> 02:05:05,560
half black, and half Chinese?

1599
02:05:06,337 --> 02:05:07,463
That's three halves.

1600
02:05:07,505 --> 02:05:09,564
Everything is coming
in threes these days, even halves.

1601
02:05:10,374 --> 02:05:11,398
Which half are you?

1602
02:05:11,409 --> 02:05:13,377
Half owner.

1603
02:05:16,380 --> 02:05:17,506
Should have been
a stand-up comedian.

1604
02:05:18,349 --> 02:05:20,340
I may hold you to that.

1605
02:05:20,384 --> 02:05:21,351
I can't help you.

1606
02:05:21,385 --> 02:05:23,353
I'm just a former cabaret owner.

1607
02:05:23,386 --> 02:05:25,355
Once a cabaret owner,
always a cabaret owner.

1608
02:05:25,356 --> 02:05:28,348
Or is it once a former
cabaret owner,

1609
02:05:28,392 --> 02:05:30,484
always a former cabaret owner?

1610
02:05:45,343 --> 02:05:47,310
Fico.

1611
02:05:47,345 --> 02:05:48,471
Take a break, chico.

1612
02:05:48,479 --> 02:05:50,413
Time to suffer.

1613
02:05:50,514 --> 02:05:52,505
Good one.

1614
02:05:52,550 --> 02:05:53,517
Thank you.

1615
02:05:53,551 --> 02:05:54,518
Ahem.

1616
02:05:56,386 --> 02:05:57,354
Thank you.

1617
02:05:57,388 --> 02:05:58,355
Look, Fico,

1618
02:05:58,389 --> 02:06:00,357
I've been...

1619
02:06:00,358 --> 02:06:01,484
I've been thinking.

1620
02:06:06,530 --> 02:06:10,489
You know, it bothers me

1621
02:06:10,534 --> 02:06:13,502
to see you, Fico Fellove,

1622
02:06:13,537 --> 02:06:15,334
working in the kitchen.

1623
02:06:15,339 --> 02:06:16,397
Nonsense.

1624
02:06:16,407 --> 02:06:18,534
Now, I've told you before
I appreciate the work.

1625
02:06:19,377 --> 02:06:21,538
Well, anyway, I was thinking.

1626
02:06:21,545 --> 02:06:25,413
What if I set up
a piano in the cafe?

1627
02:06:25,416 --> 02:06:27,384
Would you be interested in...

1628
02:06:29,453 --> 02:06:32,581
Unfortunately, the pay
would be the same,

1629
02:06:32,590 --> 02:06:35,388
but plus tips.

1630
02:06:35,493 --> 02:06:37,484
Whatever you need. Hmm?

1631
02:06:37,495 --> 02:06:39,326
You know I appreciate it.

1632
02:06:39,497 --> 02:06:40,464
Mm.

1633
02:06:40,498 --> 02:06:42,328
I'd like to keep this job, too.

1634
02:06:42,500 --> 02:06:43,467
I need the extra money.

1635
02:06:43,567 --> 02:06:44,534
I'm trying to bring my family.

1636
02:06:45,368 --> 02:06:47,337
Enough said.
Enough said.

1637
02:06:47,505 --> 02:06:48,437
To free Cuba.

1638
02:06:48,539 --> 02:06:50,404
Salud.
Salud.

1639
02:06:58,582 --> 02:07:01,551
The present
you are living in is so thin,

1640
02:07:01,585 --> 02:07:03,553
you could squeeze it
underneath a door.

1641
02:07:03,587 --> 02:07:06,420
The trouble with exile is exile.

1642
02:07:06,424 --> 02:07:07,391
Thank you.

1643
02:07:07,425 --> 02:07:09,359
I have a solution.

1644
02:07:09,493 --> 02:07:13,327
This pretty lady's torch
is Aladdin's lamp.

1645
02:07:13,330 --> 02:07:16,299
Aladdin's lamp.

1646
02:07:16,300 --> 02:07:18,325
And it will grant
any wish in your life.

1647
02:07:18,368 --> 02:07:19,426
I wish I could relive it.

1648
02:07:19,470 --> 02:07:22,405
You can by rebuilding it.

1649
02:07:22,540 --> 02:07:24,565
Will you work for me?

1650
02:07:25,376 --> 02:07:28,435
Free drinks?

1651
02:07:28,546 --> 02:07:29,535
Done.

1652
02:07:32,550 --> 02:07:35,417
Gentlemen, time to suffer.

1653
02:07:44,428 --> 02:07:46,395
The door was open.

1654
02:07:48,432 --> 02:07:49,558
You know, the thing I love
most about New York

1655
02:07:50,434 --> 02:07:53,562
is that you're always
running into old friends.

1656
02:07:53,571 --> 02:07:56,404
You know why we're friends?

1657
02:07:59,577 --> 02:08:01,545
Because we don't believe
in coincidences.

1658
02:08:01,578 --> 02:08:03,410
Please sit down.

1659
02:08:20,331 --> 02:08:21,559
You may consider me an enemy,

1660
02:08:21,599 --> 02:08:24,568
but I've always considered
you a friend, Federico.

1661
02:08:24,568 --> 02:08:28,402
I may at times have lost
my patience at times,

1662
02:08:28,405 --> 02:08:30,373
but never with a man I respect

1663
02:08:30,407 --> 02:08:32,375
and that respects me in kind.

1664
02:08:35,379 --> 02:08:37,313
How we doing there, Joe?

1665
02:08:37,348 --> 02:08:39,407
Flirting. Good.

1666
02:08:39,450 --> 02:08:40,417
Take your hat off.

1667
02:08:44,421 --> 02:08:47,515
Ah, she was a beautiful thing,
Havana.

1668
02:08:47,558 --> 02:08:50,322
We should have known she was a...

1669
02:08:50,327 --> 02:08:51,419
a heartbreaker.

1670
02:08:54,298 --> 02:08:56,357
And here we are.

1671
02:08:56,400 --> 02:08:58,560
It's bashert
destiny.

1672
02:09:02,606 --> 02:09:04,597
Now, listen.

1673
02:09:04,608 --> 02:09:06,473
Listen hard.

1674
02:09:06,510 --> 02:09:08,569
I didn't bomb your place, kid.

1675
02:09:08,578 --> 02:09:09,546
That's not my style.

1676
02:09:16,386 --> 02:09:17,479
Okay?

1677
02:09:19,490 --> 02:09:21,321
May I have an egg cream?

1678
02:09:21,458 --> 02:09:23,323
Chocolate syrup, cold milk.

1679
02:09:23,493 --> 02:09:25,462
Spritz the seltzer until
it foams up over the top.

1680
02:09:25,496 --> 02:09:26,554
No.

1681
02:09:27,398 --> 02:09:28,365
And a bit of rum, yes?

1682
02:09:28,399 --> 02:09:29,525
Yeah. An egg cream.

1683
02:09:33,470 --> 02:09:34,596
What's your name?

1684
02:09:35,439 --> 02:09:37,498
I never thought you'd ask.

1685
02:09:39,343 --> 02:09:41,310
My offer's still open.

1686
02:09:41,345 --> 02:09:44,473
A new club.
Las Vegas.

1687
02:09:44,481 --> 02:09:46,449
Nevada.
No humidity.

1688
02:09:46,483 --> 02:09:49,316
Don't answer.
Think about it.

1689
02:09:49,319 --> 02:09:50,446
You know?

1690
02:09:50,487 --> 02:09:53,422
You know, even in rejection

1691
02:09:53,424 --> 02:09:56,518
lead me on a little bit, hmm?

1692
02:09:56,560 --> 02:09:59,529
Don't break my heart...

1693
02:09:59,530 --> 02:10:01,327
just yet.

1694
02:10:05,502 --> 02:10:08,335
You like egg cream.

1695
02:10:08,339 --> 02:10:10,307
Yes, I like egg creams.

1696
02:10:10,341 --> 02:10:13,469
And I'm not crazy
about humidity, either.

1697
02:10:18,449 --> 02:10:21,509
You give my regards
to your family.

1698
02:10:25,389 --> 02:10:28,517
You have the ingredients right.

1699
02:10:28,525 --> 02:10:30,584
There's an art
with the seltzer spritz.

1700
02:10:31,362 --> 02:10:32,522
Your chocolate
goes at the bottom

1701
02:10:32,529 --> 02:10:34,326
with milk over it,

1702
02:10:34,365 --> 02:10:36,333
and then you spritz straight down,

1703
02:10:36,367 --> 02:10:39,336
but then you spritz
around the glass

1704
02:10:39,536 --> 02:10:41,504
until it rises to the top.

1705
02:10:43,374 --> 02:10:45,342
Always a pleasure, Lansky.

1706
02:10:45,342 --> 02:10:47,333
I mean Mr. Meyer.
Love your wieners.

1707
02:10:54,417 --> 02:10:55,544
Bueno, Fico.
Good night.

1708
02:10:56,420 --> 02:10:57,386
Okay, have a good time.

1709
02:10:57,421 --> 02:11:00,390
Keys are in the back.
Have a good time.

1710
02:11:00,424 --> 02:11:02,551
Good night, Mrs. Calabash,
wherever you are.

1711
02:11:02,593 --> 02:11:05,426
Gentlemen, don't burn
the place down.

1712
02:11:32,356 --> 02:11:34,290
Did you ever
have the feeling

1713
02:11:34,325 --> 02:11:35,451
that you wanted to go?

1714
02:11:38,328 --> 02:11:39,455
Did you ever
have the feeling

1715
02:11:39,496 --> 02:11:41,327
that you wanted to stay?

1716
02:11:41,332 --> 02:11:45,393
Go, stay, go, stay, go...

1717
02:11:45,435 --> 02:11:47,404
ooh.

1718
02:11:47,404 --> 02:11:49,531
That's a go, isn't it?

1719
02:11:51,575 --> 02:11:54,408
Madam, always a pleasure.

1720
02:11:54,411 --> 02:11:56,435
Give my regards
to the pigeons.

1721
02:12:12,496 --> 02:12:13,554
Why are you here?

1722
02:12:13,597 --> 02:12:17,465
I'm here...

1723
02:12:17,501 --> 02:12:19,560
with our dedication
to United Nations.

1724
02:12:23,507 --> 02:12:25,566
Do you have time for some coffee?

1725
02:12:43,394 --> 02:12:44,452
I'm sorry you left.

1726
02:12:46,530 --> 02:12:48,498
There was nothing left
for me in Havana.

1727
02:12:48,532 --> 02:12:51,330
Yes, I know.

1728
02:12:51,368 --> 02:12:52,335
You lost your club.

1729
02:12:52,469 --> 02:12:54,403
No, that's not
what I meant.

1730
02:12:54,438 --> 02:12:56,406
You sound bitter.

1731
02:12:56,440 --> 02:12:58,499
Not at all.

1732
02:12:58,509 --> 02:13:00,409
I have no money...

1733
02:13:02,479 --> 02:13:05,448
but I feel...

1734
02:13:05,449 --> 02:13:07,508
as though I'm worth more
than I ever was.

1735
02:13:07,551 --> 02:13:09,519
Would it do any good
to say I'm sorry?

1736
02:13:10,354 --> 02:13:11,446
No, not really.

1737
02:13:11,455 --> 02:13:13,355
Try at least to understand me.

1738
02:13:13,390 --> 02:13:16,325
I've understood more
than you could explain.

1739
02:13:16,359 --> 02:13:19,557
Why don't you come back
to Cuba with me?

1740
02:13:19,563 --> 02:13:22,532
Because it's dangerous...

1741
02:13:22,566 --> 02:13:24,363
for my soul.

1742
02:13:24,368 --> 02:13:26,529
I see you still do not
believe in causes.

1743
02:13:30,507 --> 02:13:32,441
Well, I don't have
a loyalty to a lost cause.

1744
02:13:35,612 --> 02:13:39,514
But I do have a loyalty
to a lost city.

1745
02:13:41,518 --> 02:13:44,487
And that's my cause and my curse.

1746
02:13:45,322 --> 02:13:46,380
Please don't hate me, then.

1747
02:13:46,490 --> 02:13:48,321
I'll never hate you.

1748
02:13:55,599 --> 02:13:57,395
I'll always love you.

1749
02:13:59,569 --> 02:14:01,538
Why can't you love me there?

1750
02:14:01,572 --> 02:14:04,336
Too big of a price to pay.

1751
02:14:23,327 --> 02:14:24,419
Be well.

1752
02:14:28,532 --> 02:14:30,295
Stop crying.

1753
02:14:34,471 --> 02:14:36,301
You can always love me here.

1754
02:14:37,908 --> 02:14:38,875
Remember that.

1755
02:14:47,484 --> 02:14:48,542
You're so beautiful.
