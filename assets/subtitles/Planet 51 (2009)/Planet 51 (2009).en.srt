1
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,960
I've never gone parking before.

2
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,160
I'm really not that kind of a girl.

3
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,240
Well, I'm not the kind of a guy
who would go with that kind of a girl.

4
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,120
That's so sweet!

5
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,840
- I think!
- There's nothing to be scared of.

6
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,120
I knew this would happen
if we made out!

7
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,800
Good shot, sir!

8
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,560
General,
I think he's surrendering.

9
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,680
Fire at will!

10
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,360
Keep firing! Keep firing!

11
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,880
Keep firing!
Kill every last alien!

12
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,320
You'll all become my alien zombies!

13
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,360
What did tell you about
these kind of movies?

14
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,960
It was almost over.

15
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:49,760
<i>¶ Lollipop lollipop
Oh, lolli lolli lolli! ¶</i>

16
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,800
<i>¶ Lollipop! ¶</i>

17
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,280

00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,760
He only looks just like his father.

21
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,720
Just like his father!

22
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,520

I hate the rain.

00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,920
It's raining rocks and dogs!

35
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,360
Great!

42
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,080
Space.

43
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,720
Universe of mystery.

44
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,120
Well, today the mystery
will be unveiled.

45
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,240
Thanks to science.

46
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,680
We now know, the universe
is nearly 500 miles long.

47
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,680
And it contains,
you're not gonna believe this...

48
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,840
...over one thousand stars.

49
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,880
Lem, come on,
liven it up!

50
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,440
And still,
the only known intelligent life...

51
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,640
...is right here on our planet.

52
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,240
No! No!
Not today...

53
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,400
What was that?

54
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,280
That's our planet after the attack
from the Humaniacs.

55
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,280
They're gonna eat our brains
for dinner!

56
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,440
- Is that true?
- Everybody, please!

57
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,720
- That's ridiculous!
- Totally ridiculous.

58
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,680
Brains for dinner?
Come on!

59
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,360
Brains are for breakfast
with cereal and milk.

60
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,160
Dinner's organs and eyeballs!

61
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Okay, everyone... everyone!
Please listen up.

62
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,000
We're not getting eaten.

63
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,600
Or harvested.
Or having our brains barbecued.

64
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,280
The universe isn't scary.

65
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,040
It's really amazing.

66
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And... don't forget to
pickup your planetary yo-yo's.

67
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,160
We've got one for each of you.

68
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,960
You are looking at the
new junior assistant curator!

69
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,240
High four!

70
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,600
Well, it's part-time now and
a full-time after I graduate.

71
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,440
How did you do, Lem?
- Got the job!

72
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,480
Knew you would.

73
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,160
Hey, I can see my whole life!

74
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,560
A house, a car...
two kids.

75
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,880
They'll grow up and have kids.

76
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,880
They will come home to
visit us on holidays.

77
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,480
Well?
- Got it!

78
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,760
Lem?

79
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,240
Congratulations on that job.

80
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,240
- I knew you could it.
- Yeah, thanks.

81
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,760
There it is...
just two more days!

82
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,880
Humaniacs III.

83
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,360
The final battle for our world!

84
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,680
- Victory or extinction!
- Victory or extinction!

85
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,040
If you guys go in costume,
I'm pretending we never met.

86
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,200
Did you just say
what I think you just said?

87
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,560
I'm a planetarium professional now.

88
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,280
I don't have time for
kid's movies anymore.

89
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,520
Kid's movies?

90
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,240
I suppose next you'll say
aliens don't exist?

91
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,520
Yeah!

92
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,600
Just as I thought.

93
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,840
You are not Lem!

94
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,760
You're an alien zombie
like in Humaniacs II!

95
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,480
Skiff,
I'm not a zombie.

96
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,360
Yeah, that's what you zombies are
programmed to say.

97
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,440
Tell me something
the real Lem know.

98
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,040
Well, I know,
Skiff is the only nutcase...

99
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,160
...who thinks the government is hiding
a whole alien evidence in Base 9.

100
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,800
And, you give candy to your puppy
so he'll poop jelly beans.

101
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,600
It was just an experiment.

102
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,480
With all due respect...

103
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,760
I put in the hours and done
a lot of alien research at work.

104
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,080
What? What are you talking about?
You work in a comic book store!

105
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,160
The greatest source of
scientific knowledge.

106
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,080
Skiff!

107
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,440
Try to unpack the fake alien poop!

108
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,960
Right away, Mr. Oglob.

109
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,480
You'll believe me, Lem.

110
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,080
When aliens put you
on the take-out menu.

111
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,000
Skiff!

112
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,400
I love fake alien poop day!

113
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,920
So, um...

114
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,880
Eckle, do you think
your sister's home?

115
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,160
- Why?
- I thought of may be...

116
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,240
I thought I might tell her
I got the job.

117
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,920
- Why?
- Forget it. You tell her for me, okay?

118
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Okay, but every time you tell me
to tell her something...

119
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,400
...she asks why don’t you
just tell her yourself.

120
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,720
What?
- And then my mom says...

121
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,840
...because you like her and then
she says that "Oh, that's so cute. "

122
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,920
And why don't you just ask
her out, already?

123
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,600
Because she's been waiting for you,
to ask her out,

124
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,000
...ever since we moved
the next door to you.

125
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,640
She... she has?
The girl of my dreams likes me?

126
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,320
This is the best day of my life!

127
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,720
Yeah, you gotta see
the kids throw up!

128
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,960
Hey, he did it!
He got the job!

129
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,360
We're so proud of you!

130
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,840
I hear, it's just one easy step-up
to senior assistant curator.

131
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:06,200
<i>¶ Oh, my love ¶</i>

Take that hill!

137
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,200
Hey, Neera.
- Hey, Lem.

138
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,800
I wanted to tell you...

139
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,400
- I got the job.
- Lem, that's great!

140
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,680
- Maybe it's time that you and me...
- Yes?

141
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,480
I mean,
would you wanna...

142
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,840
Hey, hey, Neera!

143
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,120
I've been looking all over for you.

144
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,880
You've been looking for me?

145
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,880
The "cause" needs you!

146
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,360
- The "what"?
- The "cause".

147
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,920
Glar's involved with something
he calls "protesting".

148
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,520
It's like, when you shout about stuff
that makes you upset.

149
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,760
Yeah, like our school pictures.
Why do they have to be our faces?

150
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,760
I mean, what a bummer!

151
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,520
That means, it's not good.

152
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,400
Neera, we need you,
righteous mamma!

153
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,280
I'm so honored.

154
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,520
But, Lem was about to
ask me something.

155
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,720
Yeah, man!
What you wanna ask her?

156
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,000
- It's kinda private.
- No problemo, man.

157
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,680
I mean,
I totally respect that.

158
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,480
So, Neera...

159
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,880
Neera and Lem
had a private conversation.

160
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,400
And don't wanted
anybody else around.

161
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,560
- Yeah, you know, we can talk later.
- Okay.

162
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,080
Peace.

163
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,240
That means see you later.

164
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,760
Bye!
- Bye!

165
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,360
The "cause", man!

166
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,360
I'd like to "cause" him some pain!

167
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,240
I don't wanna hear a single bubble.

168
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,040
Especially, you bubbles.

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,240
Resistance is futile.
Surrender or die!

176
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,440
Come on, Eckle.
Go, help your father.

177
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,400
<i>¶ Mister sandman, bring me a dream ¶</i>

178
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,920
What the...?

179
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,440
A duck?

180
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,600
Mom! Dad!

181
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,680
There’s a ship in the...

182
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:55,600
Open wide or the big bad
monster will get ya.

183
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,240
The battle for our world...

184
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,520
...has begun.

185
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,200
- Captain, mobilize the army.
- Yes, sir.

186
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,040
Right, men! Move it!

187
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,880
<i>Are they hostile?
Will our species survive?</i>

188
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,760
<i>One thing we do know is...</i>

189
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,920
<i>...that they show no respect
for our parking laws.</i>

190
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,920
<i>And speaking of survival,</i>

191
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,240
<i>...how will you survive
without a sparkling smile?</i>

192
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,760
<i>Give your smile that special glow.</i>

193
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,640
<i>Try the sparkle action of DentaPro!</i>

194
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,360
You know, you're really good
as that toothbrush.

195
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,760
Yeah, but what I really do best
is a suppository.

196
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,200
Now, let's see.

197
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,240
"Invasion by giant ants. "

198
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,080
"Invasion by sea monsters. "

199
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,240
"Invasion by 50 foot women!? "

200
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,000
Here it is.

201
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,920
"So you've been invaded by aliens. "

202
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,520
Keep your eyes out for aliens!
- Aliens!?

203
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,520
<i>All right, class.</i>

204
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,400
Let's try it one more time.

205
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,400
Aliens are coming!

206
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,760
Flarc, you were too slow.

207
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,680
Go join the zombies.

208
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,680
I told it!

209
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,360
The only question is...

210
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,040
Should I be terrified because
this is the end of the world

211
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,520
or happy because
I totally told it.

212
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,440
Me, I have a plan.

213
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,800
They're gonna need a native
to run the mines.

214
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,600
I'll befriend them,
show my executive skills...

215
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,200
...and "Bam" I'm in.

216
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,400
Speaking of the amendment...

217
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,080
A cork?

218
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,840
It's your best defense against
the alien's favourite form of research.

219
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,720
"The Probe. "

220
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,520
You put it in...

221
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,760
Yeah! Yeah, I think I get it.

222
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,080
Wait! This is yours.

223
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,680
I already used that one.

224
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,240
I just remembered, my job.

225
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,400
I gotta go.

226
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,680
- You know, my boss.
- Your boss?

227
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,880
No problem.

228
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,560
You guys can share.

229
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,240
<i>Uh, Neera, you have to choose.</i>

230
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,360
It's either me or Glar.

231
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,640
Oh, Lem, there's no question.

232
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,720
It's you, of course.

233
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,520
Come on.
Come on! Come on!

234
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,440
<i>Hello, this is the alien hotline.</i>

235
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,440
Yes, hi, I found the alien.

236
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,920
<i>They're here
and no weapon can stop them.</i>

237
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,480
You gotta be kidding.

238
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,280
- Hello?
- Yes, hello.

239
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,280
I found the alien!

240
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,240
<i>If you've spotted an alien fleet,
dial one.</i>

241
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,480
<i>For pod-people, dial two.</i>

242
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,280
I can breathe! I can breathe!

243
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,160
You speak my language.

244
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,040
That's amazing!
You speak my language.

245
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,520
Yeah, that's what I just said.

246
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,200
You just said,
"that's what I just said. "

247
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,840
- Say something else.
- Like what?

248
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,120
Like... what.

249
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,680
They're gonna freak back at Kennedy.

250
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,960
I'm Captain Charles T. Baker.

251
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,280
Astronaut.

252
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,160
As-tro-naut.

253
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,280
- Ass...
- tronaut.

254
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,240
Lem.

255
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,880
Lem...

256
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,320
Either your name is Lem,

257
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,080
...or you wanna mate with me.

258
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,360
Houston, we have a little problem.

259
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,680
What do you...
what do you want?

260
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,840
Thanks for asking.
Coffee light, two sugars.

261
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,880
Do you've frapuccino up here?

262
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,680
Any puff pastry too. Thanks.

263
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,520
No, I mean, are you...

264
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,120
...here to take over our world,

265
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,520
...and like, eat our brains?

266
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,880
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on!

267
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,480
What kind of sick planet is this?

268
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,480
First of all, it's supposed to be
uninhabited, okay?

269
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,080
Not full of sea monkeys
dancing to the oldies!

270
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,920
My mission was to plant Old Glory,
whack a few golf balls and...

271
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,760
...head back for
the Kids Choice Awards.

272
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,760
I'm getting slimed.

273
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,800
- What?
- You were just talking alien.

274
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,120
- Hey, I'm not the alien here, you are!
- Me? You are!

275
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,440
- No? You are!
- You are! You...

276
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,040
You came to my planet.

277
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,920
An alien planet!

278
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,040
- Hello!
- Hello.

279
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,400
Not "hello". Hello!

280
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,240
- Hello, what?
- What?

281
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,960
Let's start over.

282
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,000
Look. There’s a command module
in orbit right now.

283
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,320
It's running out of fuel.
It has to leave in 74 hours.

284
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,840
And if I'm not on it,
it goes back to Earth without me.

285
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,240
Capish?

286
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,640
I have to get to my ship
and go back up in space.

287
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,440
Can you help me?

288
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,600
You want me to take you
to your flying saucer?

289
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,960
No. If they catch me helping you
who knows what they'll do to me.

290
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,920
I'll lose everything.
My life is just getting perfect.

291
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,600
Kid...
You're a kid, right?

292
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,200
I mean, you're not like
a 1000yrs old Yoda or anything?

293
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,120
Never mind.

294
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,840
Look, you're my only hope.

295
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:17,480
But I suppose you could
leave me stranded.

296
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,240
My wife will have to support the kids.

297
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,520
Eleven... we have eleven kids.

298
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,120
Always hungry.

299
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,280
But, hey, they'll get by without a father.

300
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,480
The important thing here is
you avoid a little trouble.

301
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,680
<i>Alien hot line.
What's the nature of your sighting?</i>

302
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,200
<i>Hello! Are you there?</i>

303
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,320
<i>Hello! Are you there?</i>

304
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,440
Hey, fella!

305
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,720
Who wants a donut?

306
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,640
Silly dog!

307
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,000
<i>Get back!</i>

308
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,440
There's your flying saucer.
Now what?

309
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,360
Okay.

310
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,080
Here's the plan.

311
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,640
You knock out that cop.

312
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,000
Then, you overpower those two.

313
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,080
You neutralize that one and handcuff
the big guy to the steering wheel.

314
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,400
That's your plan?

315
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,920
- What if they start shooting?
- You're one of their own.

316
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,280
- They probably just aim for your legs.
- My legs?

317
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,680
- Don't your legs grow back?
- No!

318
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,760
We're not like your kind, okay?

319
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,720
I tell you what.
Eat this.

320
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,800
- You'll become invincible.
- Oh, good, then you do it!

321
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,720
I can't be seen breaking the law.

322
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,600
I've got the Right Stuff.

323
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,200
- The what?
- The Right Stuff.

324
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,200
It means I have lot of courage.

325
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,480
Now go!

326
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,000
Go on! Go! Go!

327
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,840
Hey, hey, Lem!
Something wrong?

328
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,600
Move in! Move in!
Move in!

329
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,600
As you can see,
the army has taken it's position...

330
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,720
<i>...for the fight
in the War of the Worlds.</i>

331
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,920
<i>Getting ready for our first
moment in...</i>

332
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,600
<i>...with invaders from outer space.</i>

333
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,160
Attention!

334
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,840
So they have came.

335
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,520
Captain!
- Sir!

336
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,560
Have your men search
the flying saucer.

337
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,760
Yes, Sir!

338
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,400
- Move!
- Sir.

339
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,560
Now our brave soldiers
are entering...

340
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,280
<i>...the alien spaceship.</i>

341
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,680
It doesn't look big enough
to be a Space Destroyer.

342
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,880
It's dark in here.

343
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,880
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, look!

344
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,080
No sign of the pilot, sir.

345
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,360
I've never seen such a hideous weapon!

346
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,160
We're up against a
cruel, sadistic enemy!

347
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,560
Seal off the town!

348
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,840
I want that alien pilot found!

349
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,440
I protest!

350
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,520
<i>They're bumming me up
with their bad vibrations.</i>

351
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,560
<i>Well, there's one thing you gotta do.</i>

352
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,480
Never mind, Captain,
the alien is right here.

353
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,560
- Grab that prisoner!
- Yes, sir.

354
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,720
Glar's not the alien!

355
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,800
Oh, no?
Then what do you call this?

356
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,880
- Hair. He likes it long.
- Very unusual.

357
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,480
You might even say...

358
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,080
...very alien!

359
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,920
Excuse me! General!

360
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,400
He does go to the high school.

361
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,560
Glar's just trying to say
the aliens might be friendly.

362
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,800
Lem!

363
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,640
Lem, you know astronomy.

364
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,720
If an alien came all this way...

365
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,600
...wouldn't it be smart enough
to come in peace?

366
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,360
No! No, no, no!

367
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,440
I mean...

368
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,040
They... they have come to
harvest our organs.

369
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,800
- To make us slaves!
- Me?

370
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,680
We should all... all of us,
right now, go home and hide.

371
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,480
That's a sensible young man.

372
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,280
Let him go.

373
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,360
And the rest of you,
go to your homes.

374
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,240
And wait for instructions.

375
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,720
Hurry up! Go, go, go!

376
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,920
Great! Just great!

377
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,840
Look, I said you'd take you
to your flying saucer, okay?

378
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,440
Well, there it is! Now leave!

379
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,040
I'll get you a blanket and
a pillow for the night.

380
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,640
It's a miracle, I'm gonna need.

381
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,320
You like the stone?
You like the stone?

382
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,600
Go! Go!

383
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,200
There it is! Stop!

384
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,600
There it is!

385
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,400
<i>¶ I'm gonna tell Aunt Mary about Uncle John ¶</i>

386
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,920
<i>¶ He claims he has the music,
but he has a lot of fun ¶</i>

387
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,720
<i>¶ Oh baby, yeah, baby ¶</i>

388
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:31,120
<i>¶ Ooh baby, having me some fun tonight ¶</i>

389
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,120
<i>¶ Well, long tall Sally,
she's built for speed ¶</i>

390
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,840
<i>¶ She got everything that Uncle John need ¶</i>

391
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:41,640
<i>¶ Oh baby, yeah, baby ¶</i>

392
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:47,040
<i>¶ Ooh baby, having me some fun tonight ¶</i>

393
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,840
<i>"What To Do When Aliens Invade"</i>

394
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,920
<i>Aliens are quite like us.</i>

395
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,480
<i>Except they have two sets of teeth,</i>

396
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,280
<i>...hypodermic fingertips,</i>

397
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,560
<i>And hypnotic eyes to
control our brains and...</i>

398
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,880
<i>...turn us into an army of zombies
and destroy our world.</i>

399
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,800
What?

400
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,840
<i>Remember,
anyone caught helping the aliens,</i>

401
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,640
<i>...will go to jail.</i>

402
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,320
Jail?

403
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,680
This is great!
Yesterday my life was perfect.

404
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:25,440
And now, I'm the most wanted
super criminal in the world.

405
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,440
At least you have a world!

406
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,040
I probably will never see mine again.

407
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,280
Our preliminary procedures
have been completed, sir.

408
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,960
The spacecraft is quarantine.

409
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,560
We're looking for a, uh,
place for your headquarters, sir.

410
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,640
- And, uh...
- Still no trace of the alien, sir!

411
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,600
Where would you hide
if you were an alien?

412
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,840
Hide?

413
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:21,600
An alien invader spends over $500
to fly across the universe...

414
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,920
...to hide!

415
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,440
You clown!

416
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,440
He's here to takeover our minds!

417
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,080
Even yours!

418
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,080
Diabolical!

419
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,160
Captain, place me under arrest!

420
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,280
Not so fast, General!

421
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:38,440
I've trained my superior intellect
to recognize alien mind slaves.

422
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,080
You're clean!

423
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,680
But he is a zombie and...

424
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,080
...those two!

425
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,440
How we know who is a zombie?

426
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,600
Well, zombies don't feel any pain.

427
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,480
- You're clean!
- You too!

428
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,800
General, you must capture
the alien alive...

429
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,240
...and bring it to me.

430
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,680
I'll unlock the secrets
of it's marvellous brain.

431
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,400
Captain, search the town!

432
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,400
Go door to door, if you must.

433
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,400
But find that alien!

434
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:28,880
Hello, "Plark",
if that really is you.

435
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,800
Have a nice day, "Serbok".

436
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,920
Or should I call you
by your alien name?

437
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:43,880
Why I have to go to the dentist
if it's the end of the world, ma?

438
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,040
Invasion or not, you gotta go!

439
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,560
My mom's a zombie!

440
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,760
Help!

441
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,320
Grab!

442
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,600
We're getting it right, uh...

443
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,760
So this is last
street we gotta do today.

444
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,520
Okay, let's start at this end.

445
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,360
Wait. I think I'm a zombie.

446
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:30,360
I'm hearing an irritating,
piercing voice in the back of my head.

447
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,200
- Oh, shut up! It's me.
- It's there again!

448
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,800
It's me, you moron.

449
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,720
Hey, what's that?

450
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,960
Hey, look!

451
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,040
<i>That's funny.</i>

452
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,320
<i>Look at this!</i>

453
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:01,880
<i>Look at the dog!</i>

454
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,320
Mom?

455
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,880
Mom... mom, don't come in!

456
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,520
Rover?
Boy, am I glad to see you, Rover!

457
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,160
Rover?

458
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,520
He is a probe we sent to take
pictures of your world.

459
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,880
A planet full of aliens...

460
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,800
...and you send back
pictures of rocks?

461
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,320
Bad boy! Bad boy!

462
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:39,200
Mom, don't... don't come in!
- The alien! Wow!

463
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,880
Can I get your autograph?

464
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,760
Eckle, this isn't a comic book,
okay? It's serious!

465
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,360
I don't mind. Comes with
being a national hero.

466
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,440
And... and my humaniacs poster?

467
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,360
And my... and my chest?

468
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,440
How... how about a snapshot?

469
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,960
Get one of me looking up
at the stars.

470
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,200
Mom!
- I saw the alien last night!

471
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,160
I'm so in!

472
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,560
I got this guy wrapped around
my little finger!

473
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,120
Let me tell you,
this alien is not so scary.

474
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:16,960
It's...

475
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,680
Your personal chef
reporting for duty, sir.

476
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,440
May I give some
tasty suggestions for tonight?

477
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,360
I've got the list of
the fattest teachers in my school.

478
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,400
Incase you're looking for a light snack.

479
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,480
Skiff, stop!

480
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,200
He's not here to eat us or anything.

481
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,320
He's harmless,
to everyone but me.

482
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,320
Better let me do the talking.

483
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,120
I think, he's eyeing you for desert.

484
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,880
It's kinda cute the way
he does that.

485
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,520
Great, let's just have a party!

486
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,720
We're doing a routine search
for the alien.

487
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,480
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

488
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,080
It's trying to control our minds!

489
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,000
What do we do?

490
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,440
Don't look in it's eyes!

491
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,520
That's how it take over your brain!

492
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,760
Brains?

493
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,560
That's right, brains!

494
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:07,360
You are my zombie slaves!

495
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,160
- I want to control your brains!
- It's inside my head!

496
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,040
His will is too strong!

497
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,840
Command us, Master!

498
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,640
Command me, too!

499
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,080
It's not real.

500
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,480
I think I know
when I'm being mind-controlled.

501
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,560
Maybe they can get me on my ship.

502
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,160
I lean toward probably not.

503
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,520
But I think I know who can.

504
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,840
<i>...just to the left of me here.</i>

505
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,200
<i>Everything is checked
and double-checked.</i>

506
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,120
<i>The High Command taking
control of the situation...</i>

507
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,280
You want our home
for your headquarters?

508
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,800
That would be a great honor!

509
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,000
Honey, tell Lem we have guests.

510
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:07,080
Lem, there's someone
you would like to...

511
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,040
Kiss the ship goodbye, Rover!

512
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,960
You really think,
you can get me on TV?

513
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,720
You're the biggest story in history!

514
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,240
The whole planet will watch!

515
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,920
The whole planet?
Interesting.

516
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,480
I left my hair products on the ship.
But I could improvise.

517
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,280
You know,
astronauts have to deal with...

518
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,720
...any kind of emergency.

519
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,960
I get it.

520
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,040
We could tell everyone, he's peaceful.

521
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,680
All we need is a safe place,

522
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,800
...a TV reporter and then
we can all get on with our lives.

523
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,480
Skiff, the comic bookstore,
let's go there.

524
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,760
Okay...

525
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,560
But if he's not house,
you're cleaning up his mess.

526
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,120
We need a slogan.

527
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,200
Like something that says it's a bummer
to make war on the aliens...

528
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,440
...when we should make, uh...

529
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,520
Hey, Neera!
- Hi.

530
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,520
- Hi!
- You kill any alien, Lem?

531
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,440
Kill any...?
Oh, no, you don't understand.

532
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,880
These soldiers aren't...

533
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,680
Oh, great!
This day gets better and better!

534
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,680
General Grawl,
you better take a look at this.

535
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,080
Professor, take a look.

536
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,440
This is obviously alien writing.

537
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,040
It says, uh...

538
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,280
Surrender or die!

539
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,440
And this is a list of surrender terms.

540
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,840
Diabolical!

541
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,120
What are you doing in Lem's room?

542
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,320
I'm afraid your son is a zombie.

543
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,240
Hey, kid, what's bugging you?

544
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,440
Neera.

545
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,160
What is that,
like an alien hernia?

546
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,760
Well, sort of...

547
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,760
It's the girl of my dreams.

548
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,360
And now me hates me.

549
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,360
Wow, hate's a strong word.

550
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,880
Maybe she just...

551
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,200
...dislikes you.

552
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,000
Plus there's another guy.

553
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,360
Glar.

554
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,200
Okay. You know your problem?

555
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,600
It's not Glar.
Or Neera.

556
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,880
It's Lem.

557
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,440
Look at you,
you're so left brain.

558
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,840
Or is it right brain?

559
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,160
Whatever, you're like
the chief of control.

560
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,640
You gotta loosen up.

561
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,040
We got a little time.

562
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,200
You, my friend, are in luck.

563
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,480
The doctor...

564
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,000
...is in!

565
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,120
Me and Green bean need to talk.

566
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,120
Before we begin,
I have a technical question.

567
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,360
Are you considered very...

568
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,280
...ugly on this planet?
- What?

569
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,280
- Because I can tell.
- No.

570
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,400
I mean...

571
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,840
- I'm okay.
- Good, good.

572
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,160
Why do chicks dig me?

573
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,920
Because I'm handsome?

574
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,760
Because I'm an astronaut?

575
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,320
Yes and yes.

576
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,520
But it's also because of
Chuck Baker's three steps...

577
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,160
...to romance.

578
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,640
Spot your prey.
Make your move.

579
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,760
Show no mercy!

580
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,080
Hey baby,

581
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,440
I saw you across the bar.

582
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:27,080
Are sparks flying
or is this place on fire?

583
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,640
- You're sure are not ugly, right?
- I think so.

584
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,160
Maybe tomorrow I'll go up in space,

585
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,000
...maybe never to return.

586
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,640
Let's make our last night,

587
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,960
...a night to remember.

588
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,680
Lem!

589
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,480
The cork! The cork!

590
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,440
Remember the plan!

591
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:52,840
The only plan here
is to get Chuck on TV.

592
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,760
I'll be right back with the reporter.

593
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,520
I'm leaving you in charge.

594
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,160
In charge?

595
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,560
You heard him!

596
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,760
Things are gonna be
different around here.

597
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,880
My wish is your command!

598
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,040
Come on, boys!
Let's track down the story.

599
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,720
We need an alien
for the 6 o'clock news.

600
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,600
- Let's go!
- Hey!

601
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,280
<i>We're really upset!</i>

602
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,560
<i>Upset we really are!</i>

603
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,080
Are we upset, really?

604
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,760
- We're really, really upset.
- Neera, I need to talk to you.

605
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,760
I thought you were after the alien.

606
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,960
- That's not what's going on.
- Then what is?

607
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,440
- I...
- Lem!

608
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,880
Mysterious Lem!

609
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:43,080
Tell us the secrets of your heart!

610
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,360
I can't say.

611
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,600
Lem, I always thought
we'd be together,

612
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:53,920
...but I need someone who doesn't always
believe what he's been told.

613
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,280
It's like Glar says...

614
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,240
The times...

615
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,920
...they are a different.

616
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,720
Maybe you should go.

617
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,480
Hey baby!

618
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,280
- What?
- This place is sparking or...

619
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,800
...this fire making
this a night or...

620
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,640
...show no mercy.

621
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,960
Did I happen to mention
I'm not ugly?

622
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,520
What?
Are you crazy?

623
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,920
Is this guy giving you bad vibrations?

624
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,000
Lem was just leaving.

625
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,880
Are you kidding me?
- If you have to do number one,

626
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,080
...use these papers.

627
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,760
If you had to do number two,
go outside.

628
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:58,080
And if it's number three,

629
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,560
I can't help you.

630
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,640
Got you, alien!

631
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:05,880
- Victory or extinction!
- Oh, yeah?

632
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:10,080
In space
no one can hear you scream.

633
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,280
- Missed!
- Crush! Kill! Destroy!

634
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,360
Crush! Kill! DestrØy!

635
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,720
Hey, master,
we wanna be destroyed too.

636
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,080
Quick, cover the camera.

637
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,640
If it's get damaged again
we will have to pay for it.

638
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,360
You're afraid of a little storm?

639
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,400
It's nothing. See?

640
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,280
Rover!

641
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:02,680
Rover!

642
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,880
Sit, Rover!
Sit, stop, heel!

643
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,960
Rover, come back!
Listen!

644
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,360
<i>You can't escape the</i>

645
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,600
It's pulling you to your doom!

646
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,880
Six o'clock news, here we go!

647
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:35,400
<i>Soon we will crush the rebel alliance...</i>

648
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,960
<i>...and control the galaxy!</i>

649
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:41,560
Thank you, thank you!
Thank you!

650
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:45,760
<i>You're a rebel spy
and a traitor to the empire.</i>

651
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,440
<i>Take her away!</i>

652
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,400
Skiff!

653
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:55,760
<i>Hasta la vista, baby!
You’re terminated!</i>

654
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,880
General, over there!
Aren't those comic books?

655
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,360
Captain, get your men!

656
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,480
We gotta get out of here now!

657
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,480
Move it! Move it!

658
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,360
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

659
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,320
Chuck, come on!

660
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,680
Sorry, too dangerous! Out!
- But...

661
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,640
Shoot him!

662
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:40,400
Don't you ever run off like that.

663
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,960
What if they take to the pound?

664
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,280
How do I find you?

665
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:46,800
Lem?

666
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,360
Oh, boy!

667
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:04,120
We better run!

668
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:07,960
Let's move!

669
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,160
Move it! Move it! Move it!

670
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,520
Let the doctor handle this.

671
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,400
Ladies,

672
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,320
Who wants to meet an astronaut?

673
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,360
- Please, one at a time.
- Chuck!

674
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:37,720
I'm on facebook.

675
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,760
Look there! The monster!

676
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,120
<i>He's getting away!</i>

677
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:08,800
Rover! No!

678
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,000
All right, quick, hot-wire the car!

679
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,320
What? Hot-wired, who?

680
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,720
When are you, green goopers,
gonna evolve?

681
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,640
<i>Attention all personnel!</i>

682
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,120
What's the matter?

683
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:50,800
Why did he do it?
I was gonna teach him to fetch.

684
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,200
Amazing!

685
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:01,640
The alien's brain is so powerful
it's controlling them even now.

686
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,040
What is it telling you to do?

687
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,760
I think I'm supposed to dig
a hive for the alien queen.

688
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,320
Yeah, I'm supposed to blow up things.

689
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,440
I mean, unless you need help
with the hive.

690
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,640
- Oh, no, I'm good.
- You sure?

691
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,920
- I'm good.
- Never mind them, Professor.

692
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,800
This thing has all the answers.

693
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,280
Where's your master?

694
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,560
Talk!

695
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:32,040
<i>The flying saucer is going to an
undisclosed location...</i>

696
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:34,160
<i>...to be taken apart and studied.</i>

697
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:38,560
This reporter is now going to
reveal to you where that location is.

698
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,280
This reporter has just been told,

699
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:44,480
...that if I do that,
I'll be taken apart and studied.

700
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,720
Oh, look, that's perfect.

701
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:59,040
That's great!
Oh, just great! Perfect!

702
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,960
John Glenn goes around the world...

703
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,280
...he's a Senator for life!

704
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,480
I went across the freaking universe!

705
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,600
I should be Governor, minimum!

706
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:11,000
But no, I'm marooned here
on this stupid rock!

707
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,320
This "stupid rock" is my home.

708
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:21,840
Or was until you came along
and ruined everything.

709
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,640
I want my life back!

710
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:26,560
Unless, I don't know, maybe there's
something else you want to ruin.

711
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,000
Who's that?

712
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,600
My boss.

713
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:38,520
Sorry, Mr. Hucklo,
it's just for one night.

714
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:39,400
Maybe a week.

715
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:42,600
I really hope this doesn't affect our
working relationship.

716
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,240
Oh, great! Just great!

717
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,480
Fired!

718
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,520
Why don't you just
harvest my organs and...

719
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:58,960
...get it over with.

720
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,920
Great, now look what you did.
You made him really upset.

721
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:11,640
Lem?

722
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:25,800
Lem?

723
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,480
You're looking right at my home..

724
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,320
See that star,
the little red one?

725
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:41,920
Circling that star is a planet called Earth.

726
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,960
It's about 20 billion miles away.

727
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,840
- Give or take.
- There's no way space is that big.

728
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,960
What?
Are you kidding?

729
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:52,280
There's billions of galaxies.

730
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:55,440
And each galaxy has billions of stars.

731
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:58,800
Next to that, kid,
our planets are just...

732
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,000
...dust in the wind.

733
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:05,200
So, nothing I knew was right?

734
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,120
Come on, you knew about Neera.

735
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,240
I mean, look at her.

736
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,720
Lose the antenna,
get some plastic surgery...

737
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,240
...she's a hottie.

738
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:16,960
I don't have the right stuff
like you.

739
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,360
Kid...

740
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,880
I never had the right stuff.

741
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,960
I'm a button pusher.

742
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,080
Spam in a can.

743
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,800
I don't even fly the ship.
It's all automatic.

744
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:41,920
I only got this far on charm
and my rugged good looks.

745
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:47,400
You risked everything to help
a stranger from another world.

746
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,960
You are the one
with the right stuff.

747
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,200
Finally, we been looking for you.

748
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,400
Guys!

749
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,480
Great hiding spot!

750
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:06,120
- I go for the closet!
- No way!

751
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,720
Let's go fight the army.

752
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,120
How's your species at hiding?

753
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,200
Can you change your skin
to this colour?

754
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,840
Your call Captain Baker.

755
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,480
What's it gonna be?
Fight or hide?

756
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,320
Neither.

757
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,880
I think Lem said
he wants the closet.

758
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,320
I tell you what's it gonna be.

759
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,720
We're gonna go get Chuck
back to his ship.

760
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:26,080
Skiff, you were right about Base 9.

761
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,480
- That where they have his ship.
- But, we don't where it is.

762
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:32,080
Yes, we do.
Rover found me,

763
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,280
...he's also programmed
to find my ship.

764
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,160
Wait.
Where is Rover?

765
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,720
It's too painful to talk about!

766
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,440
It's okay.

767
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,520
They've got him
at the comic book shop!

768
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,320
Well, then we've gotta go get him!

769
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:51,040
Hold on.
The whole army's looking for you two!

770
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,160
You can't just stroll through town.

771
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:56,440
Wait! Wait!
That new movie...

772
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,520
...doesn't that open tonight?

773
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,080
Yeah...

774
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,560
Why?

775
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:16,560
The citizens of Glipforg
are undaunted by alien invaders.

776
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:20,120
And bravely going about
their normal routines.

777
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,120
Gotcha!

778
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,800
There's the comic book store.
Let's go!

779
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,800
What great costumes!

780
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,800
You two are finalists.

781
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,000
Up on stage!

782
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:44,600
No, we're not here to
enter the contest.

783
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:47,360
Then why are you dressed
like aliens?

784
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,120
We're here...

785
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,120
...to win the contest.

786
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,320
- What?
- Yeah! Good.

787
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:08,000
Private, come here.

788
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:18,600
Hold your fire, soldier.

789
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,200
Take us to your leader.

790
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:26,680
Welcome to the "Humaniacs 3"
costume contest!

791
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,600
Really upset!

792
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,760
Really upset!

793
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,520
Well, here we got the finalists.

794
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:43,000
What are we supposed to do?

795
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:46,200
Give them their
daily minimum dose of Chuck.

796
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,920
Hello, Humaniacs!

797
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:02,800
<b>Greased Lightning performed by
Lance Ellington</b>

798
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:04,640
The alien!

799
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:17,560
Lem!

800
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:19,960
Over here!

801
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,280
All these costumes, sir.

802
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:30,720
How do we find the alien?

803
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:33,920
It's simple, Captain.
Like us, the alien is in uniform.

804
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:36,280
Grab him!

805
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:37,960
I got you!

806
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:41,440
Chuck!
No! No! Get up!

807
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,080
Hey, keep back!

808
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,520
Time to meet the monster.

809
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,200
Face to face!

810
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:10,200
Look at it, Professor.

811
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,680
It's hideous!

812
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,680
And it smell!

813
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:17,000
Hey, you try wearing the same suit
for three weeks.

814
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,120
What a remarkable brain
you must have.

815
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:22,760
An incision here.

816
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:26,040
And here.
It should pØp right out.

817
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:31,640
No, you're making a mistake!
He's friendly!

818
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,840
This poor boy is obviously a zombie.

819
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:36,440
I’ll remove his brain too.

820
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,000
You are no longer needed slave!

821
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:54,960
I release you!

822
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:57,600
Return to your puny life!

823
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,680
Kid, I'm going down anyway.

824
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,080
There's no need for you
to come with me.

825
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:05,800
Thanks.

826
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:07,280
For everything.

827
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:11,080
How about it, Professor?

828
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,200
Difficult to tell.

829
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,760
Do you still believe
the alien is friendly?

830
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:23,680
No.

831
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:26,360
This boy is free!

832
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,720
We're so glad you're not a zombie.

833
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:34,120
What about the alien spawn, sir?

834
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:36,160
I want it destroyed.

835
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:38,520
One little piece at a time.

836
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:46,680
All right. Let's get these
aliens to Base 9.

837
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:50,400
Not that it exists.

838
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:00,040
Move it!

839
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:05,720
Get in!

840
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,920
<i>We're here to honor a young man...</i>

841
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:27,240
...who survived a harrowing ordeal...

842
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:29,520
...at the hands of the alien monster.

843
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,720
Lem, come on out!

844
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,160
All right?

845
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:43,920
So, Lem, I understand you'll be working
right here after you graduate.

846
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:46,560
Teaching about the mysteries of space.

847
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:49,040
Give us a preview of
what we'll learn.

848
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:56,320
Well, we know everything
about our universe.

849
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:58,440
It's 500 miles long.

850
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:00,600
500 miles!

851
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,240
Remarkable.

852
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:06,320
I can't.

853
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:08,960
Space isn't 500 miles!

854
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:13,120
It's not. It's so much bigger
than we can imagine.

855
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:17,960
There's billions of galaxies and
each galaxy has billions of stars.

856
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:20,560
And next to that,
our planet is just...

857
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,000
<i>Excuse me.</i>

858
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:39,240
Lem?

859
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:42,280
I know I was kinda harsh.

860
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,080
I'm really sorry.

861
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:48,800
Hi, Neera.

862
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:50,360
What are you doing?

863
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:51,720
It's called hot-wiring.

864
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:53,520
It's how they start cars on Earth.

865
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,240
Lem, um...

866
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:59,320
I was thinking... well...

867
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,280
You know, now that
this is all over...

868
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:03,480
- Yeah, Neera?
- Maybe...

869
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:04,920
We could...

870
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:08,800
Lem!

871
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:10,600
You left everyone hanging.

872
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:12,720
I'm gonna go find Chuck.

873
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:13,840
But how?

874
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:15,840
It's impossible without Rover.

875
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,880
My little Rovy.

876
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:23,520
I can still hear his
waging little antenna.

877
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:24,760
Rover?

878
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:26,440
Rover!

879
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:29,960
Rover!

880
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,600
Rover!

881
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:32,920
You're alive.

882
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,920
But... how did you get out?

883
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:40,640
Good going, boy.

884
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:42,520
Rover... Rover, can you find Chuck?

885
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:43,800
Where's Chuck?

886
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:00,360
You're going with me?
- Hm-Hmm.

887
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:03,960
All right!

888
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,080
So you thought you could
take over our world?

889
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,840
Your kind knows no decency.

890
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:25,040
You mean Jake Mankins?

891
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:27,160
No, aliens.

892
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:29,640
Tell us your invasion plans!

893
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:32,080
And don't bother taking over my mind.

894
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:33,240
If you do...

895
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,600
Captain Kizno has orders to shoot me.

896
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:37,600
If you take over Captain Kizno's mind,

897
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,680
Lt. Groit has orders to shoot him.

898
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,120
If you take over Lt. Groit's mind,

899
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:44,320
Sergeant Yerk will shoot Captain Kizno,
Lt. Groit and myself...

900
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,000
...along with these three soldiers.

901
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:48,880
Each man has a designated
target in the squad.

902
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,400
Should you succeed in taking over
all of our minds,

903
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:54,560
Corporal Hisk has orders to
electrocute everyone.

904
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:58,240
If this fails,
the entire base is rigged to blow...

905
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:00,360
...at the touch of a button.

906
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:03,480
General, sir, am I supposed to shoot
Hecknavar or Kolski?

907
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:05,600
- I shoot Kolski!
- No, you shoot Meckavoy.

908
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:06,920
Well, then who shoots Kolski?

909
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,240
I can shoot myself.

910
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:09,560
That won't be necessary.

911
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:13,280
Hecknavar, you shoot Kolski,
Captain Kisno and graze Corporal Hisk.

912
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:15,680
- Yes, sir.
- Not yet!

913
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:18,680
- Drop your weapon!
- You!

914
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:20,400
- Him first!
- You!

915
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:23,360
- I'm not taking my eyes off Kisno!
- Drop it, Dirt-bag!

916
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,160
Hold your fire!

917
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:48,560
Hold your fire!

918
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:53,480
Captain Kizno...

919
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,280
...get everyone out of here.

920
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:59,400
You're not thinking
all this is my fault, right?

921
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:00,680
All right.

922
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,120
You won't tell us.

923
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:04,560
There's another way to unlock
the secrets of your brain.

924
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,520
Professor Kipple!

925
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,880
<i>He's all yours.</i>

926
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:46,360
He thinks we found him.

927
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:52,760
Hang on, Chuck.

928
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:54,080
We'll find you.

929
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:06,560
There you are.

930
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:08,560
I was just warming up for you.

931
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:11,720
I'll have that brain of his, no time.

932
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:14,280
You don't want my brain,
it's useless.

933
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:16,560
I spent four years at a party school.

934
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:18,920
Trust me, it's mush.

935
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:23,960
Hello?

936
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:25,680
Anyone here?

937
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:31,800
Skiff, what are you doing?

938
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:34,160
Come on, no one's around.

939
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:35,680
I'm not gonna get caught.

940
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:53,960
What, what, what?
I'm paying! I'm paying!

941
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:12,800
The thing with the...

942
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:17,400
I mean, it just went over the...
Wow!

943
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,160
Base 9...

944
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:46,160
This is amazing!

945
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:48,160
I was right again!

946
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:54,760
How do we get in
without being seen?

947
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,160
Hold now!
- What?

948
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:17,240
<i>But I'm sorry, officer,
your rules ain't good for me.</i>

949
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:23,320
<i>One thing you gotta do that's
stick it to the man! Stick it to the man!</i>

950
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:26,800
<i>Stick it to the man! Stick to...</i>

951
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:31,000
Now!

952
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:36,000
Cool...

953
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:42,160
I don't suppose your planet's
invented pain killers?

954
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:32,240
Good work, RØver!

955
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:42,200
Guys, this is so Luke Skywalker!

956
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:44,360
By the way,

957
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,360
...you're not brother and sister, right?

958
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:49,280
How much time is left?
- Just enough.

959
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:52,000
Rover here will take us
right to my ship.

960
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:56,800
That's a funny place for his antenna!

961
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:01,280
Captain, I want the whole base
on red alert.

962
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:02,440
Yes, sir!

963
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:04,880
General, you must save its brain.

964
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:07,960
I'm more concerned with
saving our world.

965
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:13,600
<i>Move it out! Move it out!</i>

966
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:33,640
That professor's a genius!

967
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:37,200
I feel... positively effervescent.

968
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:40,120
In fine fettle.
What a salubrious experience!

969
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:42,200
Well said. Cheers.

970
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:09,920
My ship.

971
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:11,480
Hey, way to go, kid.

972
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:20,240
<i>Step away from the flying saucer!</i>

973
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:24,280
And put your hands in the air!

974
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:40,080
There was never a chance
for you to getaway.

975
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:46,440
You'd destroy the whole base...

976
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:47,840
...just to get me?

977
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,520
That is sick!

978
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:51,200
Actually, it's kind of flattering.

979
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:52,280
Sick?

980
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:54,880
Sick, young lady, is helping the
enemy of your world!

981
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:58,080
Sick is befriending a creature
that's so completely...

982
01:12:58,760 --> 01:12:59,720
...different!

983
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,360
Sick is...

984
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:03,680
Well look, it's right in front of you.

985
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:05,800
I'm sorry, Professor.

986
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:08,880
It's too dangerous to let
the alien live another minute.

987
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,240
Wait, wait, wait! Stop!

988
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:15,880
General...

989
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:18,480
I know what you're afraid of.

990
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,360
And... it's not Chuck.

991
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:23,760
It's not monsters or...
or aliens.

992
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,920
It's the unknown.

993
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:29,000
I've spent my whole life
running from it.

994
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:30,480
And...

995
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,720
I think maybe you’ve too.

996
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:35,160
But I'm telling you...

997
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:38,080
...the unknown isn't something
to be afraid of.

998
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:40,040
It can be your best friend.

999
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:44,240
And just when you think that it means
the end of everything you know...

1000
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:48,000
It's really just the beginning.

1001
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:51,840
<i>Base destruct...</i>

1002
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,640
<i>...2 minutes.</i>

1003
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:56,720
What... What are you looking at?
Run!

1004
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:05,600
Take that!

1005
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:15,720
Everyone on board!
Let's go!

1006
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:20,640
<i>Attention all personnel.
Evacuate Base immediately.</i>

1007
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:30,840
What are you doing?
- I can't leave him here!

1008
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:34,480
- Why not?
- Because he's got the right stuff!

1009
01:14:57,120 --> 01:15:00,240
<i>Base destruct,
60 seconds.</i>

1010
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:08,640
There's no time for auto-pilot!

1011
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:09,680
What's the matter now?

1012
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:12,960
I'm gonna have to pilot this bucket.

1013
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:34,480
<i>Base destruct in 15 seconds.</i>

1014
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:36,880
She is so heavy!

1015
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:39,200
<i>Ten...</i>

1016
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:40,400
<i>nine...</i>

1017
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:41,640
<i>Eight...</i>

1018
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:42,880
<i>Seven...</i>

1019
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:44,120
<i>Six...</i>

1020
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:45,360
<i>Five...</i>

1021
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:46,600
<i>Four...</i>

1022
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:47,840
<i>Three...</i>

1023
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:49,480
<i>Two...</i>

1024
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:50,600
<i>One!</i>

1025
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:23,000
You guys should check this out.

1026
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:51,960
Hey, what do you think?
- It's such a big universe.

1027
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:54,600
I'm definitely coming back here!

1028
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:08,560
Am I a zombie now?

1029
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:12,800
This guy reads too many comic books.

1030
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:19,240
Hey, Neera.

1031
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,000
Now that this is all over...

1032
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:24,560
- Would you wanna...
- Yes!

1033
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:26,680
But you didn't hear what I...

1034
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:35,200
Gross!

1035
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:38,800
Strap in, everyone.

1036
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:40,800
Because I'm taking you home.

1037
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:18,760
Hey, it's Lem!

1038
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:23,720
Hi.

1039
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:28,320
The monster!

1040
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:31,600
Hey, it's all right, Chief.
He's with me.

1041
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:34,360
Soldiers, attention!

1042
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:37,920
There is among us... an astronaut.

1043
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:43,800
Captain...

1044
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:46,080
Thanks for coming back for me.

1045
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:47,920
A pleasure, General.

1046
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:51,560
Maybe next time you have guests,
you'll throw a better party.

1047
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:57,880
Kid, how'd you like to be president...

1048
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:02,320
...of the local
"Chuck Baker party maker" fan club?

1049
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:08,800
Be a good bØy.

1050
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:12,080
And don't forget to drink your oil.

1051
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:15,680
Rover.

1052
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:17,480
You coming?

1053
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,760
Or you wanna stay here?

1054
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:23,800
Rover!

1055
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:26,400
My little big boy.

1056
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:36,280
Lem...

1057
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:38,480
You saved my life.

1058
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:41,520
And you saved mine, too.

1059
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:48,880
That was a, uh, man hug just there.

1060
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:50,480
It's very big on my planet.

1061
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:54,440
Hey, take care of this guy, okay?

1062
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:05,080
You're a great planet
and your '50s are fine.

1063
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:07,640
But give me a call
