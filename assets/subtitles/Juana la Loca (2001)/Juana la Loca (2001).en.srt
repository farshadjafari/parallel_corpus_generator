1
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,630
Tordesillas,
The year of Our Lord 1554.

2
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,590
She is 74 years old

3
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,890
and has been locked up in this castle
for almost half a century.

4
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,470
She has been successively
betrayed by her father,

5
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,710
by her husband and by her son.

6
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,330
Daughter of the Catholic Monarchs,

7
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:54,880
wife of Philip of Habsburg,
mother of the Emperor Charles V,

8
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,140
queen in her own right
of Castile and Aragon.

9
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,280
They call her

10
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,130
Joan the Mad.

11
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,170
When I close my eyes,
he approaches me.

12
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,950
I feel his skin beneath my fingertips.

13
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,450
His voice flows into my ears.

14
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:19,360
I perceive the odor ofhis armpits.

15
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,920
He arouses my desire.

16
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,810
I do not fear death.

17
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:28,160
No matter what,
it will take me to Philip.

18
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,640
JOAN THE MAD

19
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,480
Lady Elvira.

20
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,810
We're spending the night here.

21
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,540
Laredo is only a few hours away.

22
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:05,450
- Anything else, Captain?
- Whatever Her Majesty orders.

23
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:18,820
Alvar!

24
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,530
May I still call you Alvar?

25
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,610
Of course, Princess.

26
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,670
You may still call meJoan.

27
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:39,200
Look.

28
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,800
You gave it to me, remember?

29
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,680
I'll never forget
our happy childhood days.

30
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,410
They're taking me to be wed, Alvar.

31
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,130
In Flanders.

32
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,740
All my blessings.

33
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,250
What are you thinking, daughter?

34
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,670
This time tomorrow,
I'll be on my way to Flanders.

35
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,370
And far from you.

36
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,870
It's God's will.

37
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:37,940
And yours too.

38
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,450
That is so.

39
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,600
The sovereign of Castile,

40
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,060
Queen Isabella the Catholic,

41
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:49,100
has set out,
accompanied by her children.

42
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,240
They are all there,

43
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:55,220
Princess Isabella,
John, Catherine and Maria,

44
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,200
to accompany their sisterJoan

45
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,180
as she sets out
on her greatjourney to Flanders.

46
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:05,840
Laredo, August, 1496.

47
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,730
Be a good girl, Catherine.

48
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,760
I'll be thinking about you.

49
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,070
God chose to make me
Queen of Castile.

50
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,930
My people have crossed the seas
in search of another world.

51
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,070
Yet the sea is still a mystery to me.

52
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,290
I am too old to undertake a voyage.

53
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,970
So you will never come to see me.

54
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,520
My duty is to your father
and to Castile,

55
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,050
as your duty will be
to Philip of Habsburg,

56
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,940
to Burgundy and to Flanders.

57
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:49,470
I shall obey you, Mother.

58
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,430
I know that my life, like yours,
requires greater endeavor

59
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:55,830
than my humble person can offer.

60
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,450
That is so.

61
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,510
My prayer book.

62
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,070
I got it from my mother.

63
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,110
You were born a princess
and must accept it.

64
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:34,140
It is true that your marriage
to Philip is for political reasons,

65
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,670
but some happiness is also possible.

66
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,480
No one, except God,

67
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:44,640
possesses the power and knowledge
of what is to come.

68
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,930
Did you know Father
before you married him?

69
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,460
I married Ferdinand for love.

70
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,240
How will I know if I love Philip?

71
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,450
With time.

72
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,120
Put it there. Be careful.

73
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,270
With time.

74
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,720
Perhaps you will never know.

75
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,470
If that is so,

76
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,510
take consolation in living
in sanctity with a man.

77
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,010
And if you're asked,

78
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,600
answer as I do,
that you married him for love.

79
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,050
It is an enormous task.

80
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,030
At times,

81
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,450
a painful and terrible task.

82
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,220
Don't cry, child.

83
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,760
You'll soon have a husband.

84
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,120
Soon, my princess,

85
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:22,080
you'll be a woman
and you'll dream of paradise.

86
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:37,760
Ready.

87
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,710
Raise your bows.

88
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,620
Take aim.

89
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,320
Now!

90
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,500
The Spanish fleet arrived yesterday

91
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,720
in Ostende, Sire.

92
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,370
- How is the princess?
- Princess Joan

93
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,620
is in good health.

94
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,860
She is anxious to meet you.
Tomorrow morning

95
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,540
- she will reach Brussels.
- Lord de Veyre,

96
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,460
how soon can we be in Brussels?

97
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,300
With a change of horses,
we can be in the palace

98
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,120
tomorrow evening, Sire.

99
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,630
My horse!

100
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,450
Double formation!

101
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,050
Present arms!

102
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,450
Brigitte de la Motte.

103
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:00,980
Carlota de Foix.

104
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,190
Inés de Bravante.

105
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,960
The letter, Madam.

106
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:27,700
The letter.

107
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,080
"I have the honor to address

108
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,860
the Archduke of Austria and
Duke of Burgundy and Bravante,

109
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:46,920
and to wish you every blessing
on behalf of my beloved parents,

110
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,850
the monarchs of Castile and Aragon.

111
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,560
I also wish to express
my joy and satisfaction

112
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,650
on establishing between our kingdoms

113
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,010
an eternal union blessed
by the Pope and the Church."

114
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:19,720
The princess and I wish
to be married immediately.

115
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,580
Who must give us the blessing?

116
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:29,430
Sire, it is the Bishop of Malinas
who is to bless this union,

117
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:32,950
but that will be, God willing,
a week from now.

118
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,780
The ceremony will take place
on that day as planned,

119
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,080
but the princess and I wish
to celebrate it in privacy, now.

120
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,020
Do you agree, Princess?

121
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,910
Your blessing, Father.

122
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,670
Kneel down.

123
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:56,530
May the Lord God

124
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,890
confirm your mutual consent
expressed before the Church.

125
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:02,610
What God has joined
let no man pull asunder.

126
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,830
We shall see you at the official
ceremony within a week.

127
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:57,650
What?

128
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,410
Don't leave.

129
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,450
Please.

130
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,070
Brigitte, Inés.

131
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:06,230
Brigitte, Inés! Come here!

132
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,860
The old folk say that
a lass pulls more than a rope.

133
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,480
But they forget one thing.

134
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:35,360
You have to adorn the lass.

135
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,780
Now, my princess,
take a little turn around.

136
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:41,270
Just a few steps.

137
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:00,790
If you don't close your legs,
the whole court will laugh.

138
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,080
Leave us.

139
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,000
Are all lovers like him, Aida?

140
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,240
No, my child, no.

141
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:24,210
Tonight I'll paint your nipples
and your lips with henna.

142
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,380
I want you to drive him mad.

143
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,210
October 1497.

144
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,780
Death has begun
to trace out its plans

145
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,030
by stealing the life ofJohn,

146
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:46,750
the firstborn of
the Catholic Monarchs.

147
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,230
Fate will still have to cut short
another four lives

148
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:55,450
before making Joan into
the heiress to the crown of Castile.

149
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,550
It's a girl!

150
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,570
Meanwhile, at the court in Brussels,

151
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,910
life was forcing its way through,

152
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,180
thanks toJoan's abundant fertility.

153
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:20,900
Your daughter.

154
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,880
She will be called Eleanor.

155
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,190
Majesty.

156
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,640
Sire, it was a very easy birth,
and very beautiful.

157
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,020
Joan, are you there?

158
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:48,960
She's a glutton.

159
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,510
She wants to devour me.

160
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,390
You're the only princess
who breast-feeds her children.

161
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,310
- Why do you insist?
- I like it.

162
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,680
And so does Eleanor.

163
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,970
It helps ease
the pain in my breasts.

164
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,690
There are other ways
to ease that pain.

165
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,790
I will not be milked like a cow.

166
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,740
My daughter is alive and I want
to feed her with my own blood.

167
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:22,190
Your words and your behavior
are surprising everyone.

168
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,110
Don't get dressed.

169
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:34,500
Lord de Veyre received a letter
from my father. I have to see him.

170
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,650
Let him wait.

171
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,170
He has told me
there is important news

172
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:41,230
regarding our friends from France.

173
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:53,570
Your husband has duties which
require his attention, Madam.

174
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,260
My husband's first duty
is to make me happy.

175
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,200
I am full.

176
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,680
You are mad.

177
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:13,200
Joan, it is barely a month
since you gave birth.

178
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,970
We mustn't abandon ourselves
to such transports.

179
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,000
Despite everything,

180
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:28,980
the days and months passed
happily in the palace.

181
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,680
Excuse me.

182
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:15,340
- Yes, Madam?
- An indisposition.

183
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:29,300
Accompany her. You go too.

184
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,330
It is nothing, Sire.

185
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:13,930
- Madam, do you feel well?
- Yes, very well.

186
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,800
The poor man shits,
the rich man too.

187
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,610
- What can ail her?
- I don't know.

188
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,320
Is anything wrong, Madam?

189
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:37,620
How pregnant is she?

190
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,030
Eight months.

191
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,710
She wouldn't have it here and now?

192
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:44,690
Her Highness is like a cow.

193
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,550
Say something, Madam, please.

194
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,860
Come in.

195
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,260
A ribbon.

196
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,820
October 1500.

197
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,970
The newborn would become,
with time,

198
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:06,480
the glorious Emperor Charles I
of Spain and Vof Germany.

199
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,680
Give the word.

200
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:10,900
Lady Elvira!

201
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,020
Lady Elvira!

202
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:26,320
The hand of death would soon
strike down Queen Isabella,

203
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:30,430
on November 24, 1504.

204
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,780
Send the swiftest horseman you have

205
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,880
to carry the news to Flanders.

206
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:05,310
I hear there is an old friendship
between you and Princess Joan.

207
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:09,820
My father was her Latin teacher.
I often played with the princess.

208
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:14,390
Perhaps the news will be less painful
coming from your lips.

209
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:18,390
How many days will it take you
to reach Brussels?

210
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,210
I'll ride day and night.

211
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,040
"Because of the great heat

212
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,330
"Because of the great heat

213
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,390
and because the windows were closed,

214
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:53,340
her dress was undone

215
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:56,700
and her breasts were revealed
like two apples from Paradise."

216
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:59,770
A woman and a tipple by the nipple.

217
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:11,260
Raise your head, Madam.

218
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:15,270
Look a little longer
in this direction. Like that.

219
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,850
What are they laughing at?

220
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,800
Aida is competing with you, Sir.

221
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,690
- I do not understand, Madam.
- Ask Inés de Bravante.

222
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:28,360
- Why are you laughing, Lady Inés?
- I'm being tickled.

223
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:33,130
Ask her who tickles her at night.

224
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:36,890
Which fortunate gentleman
tickles you at night?

225
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,430
Does he make you laugh like that?

226
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:41,180
What a cheek! How dare you?

227
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:44,070
My breast guards
that secret jealously.

228
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:50,310
Is it the breast
you're painting so carefully

229
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,100
which guards your secrets?

230
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,260
Without the necklace.

231
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:08,260
- It's better with the pink dress.
- I hate pink.

232
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:10,780
It's my lord Philip who hates pink.

233
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,990
"And turning the other way,

234
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,040
ashamed that he could
be seen by Diafebus,

235
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:19,870
unable to pronounce another
word, he said: I love."

236
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:07,520
A double step.

237
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,680
Right, left.

238
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:25,980
Madam.

239
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:29,540
A messenger has arrived from Spain.

240
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,670
Welcome, Captain.

241
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:52,650
Speak. What has
happened in Castile?

242
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,270
Castile has been orphaned.

243
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:24,650
Lord de Veyre.

244
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,560
Proclaim court mourning.

245
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,330
"Thank you" is little
for your efforts, Captain.

246
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,300
Thank you.

247
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,080
Where is Philip?

248
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,440
The archduke wasn't feeling well.

249
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:53,030
He went out for air a moment ago.

250
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:55,530
He'll be in the hunting lodge.

251
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:13,010
Do you know what this news means?

252
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,070
You and the archduke are now
the monarchs of Castile.

253
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,100
Make way for Princess Joan!

254
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,820
Make way for the archduchess!

255
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,490
What is happening?

256
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:08,710
They're guarding the palace, as usual.

257
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,810
Restrain that dog!

258
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:18,450
You want it to attack me?

259
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,210
Where is the archduke?

260
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,110
Lord de Veyre,

261
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,730
where is the archduke?

262
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,330
It would be best
if you did not know, Madam.

263
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,530
Traitor!

264
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,160
Traitor!

265
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,530
Traitor! Traitor!

266
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,080
Monster!

267
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:24,060
- Son of a bitch!
- Mind your tongue!

268
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:27,900
You're talking like a slut,
and I won't be humiliated.

269
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:32,690
It is I who have been humiliated!
I who have been betrayed!

270
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,130
I feel dirty.

271
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,240
Soiled!

272
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,320
Contaminated!

273
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:42,620
Mad.

274
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,280
You're mad.

275
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,490
Mad!

276
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,770
Always mad!

277
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:54,620
It must be madness

278
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:57,050
to love someone
as despicable as you!

279
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,850
Who was that?

280
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,600
I have to know who that whore is.

281
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,060
Sire.

282
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,930
I shall give you the news.

283
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,970
Queen Isabella is dead.

284
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,020
The archduchess is now
Queen Joan of Castile,

285
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:39,580
and you are consort.

286
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:41,940
My mother is dead!

287
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,690
My husband is unfaithful!

288
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,820
My mother is dead!

289
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:52,830
My husband is unfaithful!

290
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,000
My mother is dead!

291
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,550
My husband is unfaithful!

292
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:08,670
My mother is dead!

293
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,330
None of this is true.

294
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:16,280
My imagination!

295
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,940
Whims.

296
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:21,820
Whims ofJoan the Mad,
because I am mad.

297
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,900
I'm mad, am I not?

298
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:27,740
Yes, I am mad.

299
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,310
Mad, mad, mad!

300
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:34,010
I'm mad! I'm mad!

301
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:37,660
Mad!

302
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:03,930
Inés, come here.

303
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:27,970
Turn round.

304
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,380
Hold this whore.

305
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:35,170
- Madam, please...
- Hold her!

306
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,610
Scissors.

307
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,980
- Madam...
- I said I want scissors.

308
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,100
Do not commit an injustice.

309
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:28,450
What happened?

310
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,940
The queen is suspicious.

311
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:38,210
She thinks that...
And with her own hands...

312
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:18,930
Why did you do it?

313
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,890
I hate everything that comes
between your body and mine,

314
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,850
even the air.

315
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:26,790
Your behavior is scandalous.

316
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:29,980
I am sovereign of Burgundy
and I've made you king of Castile.

317
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:33,250
But I also want to be your wife,

318
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,010
- your woman and your whore.
- Am I to be compelled?

319
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,510
I'm more powerful than you,
and craftier.

320
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:43,020
And more shameless,
to speak to me in that tone.

321
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,910
It isn't shamelessness.

322
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,180
It's passion.

323
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:49,540
Uncontrollable passion.

324
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,770
With reason it's rumored
that you are mad.

325
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,690
Mad, because I love you
to the point of madness?

326
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:16,850
Mad, because I want you
to be mine?

327
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,130
Mad,

328
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:26,060
because I don't want you going to
another for what I have in abundance?

329
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,010
Mad, because I aspire to engender

330
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,340
and bear your children?

331
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,170
Mad...

332
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:42,290
Mad with love.

333
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,290
Is that madness?

334
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,020
Joan and Philip traveled to Spain

335
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,610
to be proclaimed
sovereigns of Castile.

336
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:02,070
The people gave
an enthusiastic welcome

337
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,570
to the young monarchs.

338
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,060
Look at her.

339
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:13,200
She's holding him so tightly
it's like she wanted to hurt him.

340
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:17,780
Untimely bouts of crying,
groundless fits of rage,

341
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:19,530
continuous eccentricities.

342
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:20,880
She chooses

343
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,220
the ugliest ladies-in-waiting.
You know why?

344
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,390
Yes, the king is
an inveterate womanizer,

345
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:30,000
unworthy of the love
the queen bears him.

346
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:32,820
And unworthy of occupying
the throne of Castile.

347
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:36,830
Philip wants to be rid
of a jealous wife

348
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:39,760
and also be rid of one
who is queen of Castile.

349
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,290
Don't pretend you don't know.

350
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:06,160
Admiral Henríquez.

351
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,900
I want you to love Philip
as if he too were Castilian.

352
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,680
I want the people
to be happy with their king.

353
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,370
The people love you
and will love what you love.

354
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,420
I am a doctor, and I can tell you.

355
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,190
- She is not mad.
- The people think otherwise.

356
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:42,390
They don't give the same meaning
to the word "mad" as you do.

357
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:45,100
Speak to those who have lived
with her in Flanders.

358
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,510
They'll tell you
what they've seen and heard.

359
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,380
We have visitors. Honest people.

360
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:22,970
Leave this table free.

361
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,450
Your turn.

362
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:54,770
A gentleman has requested
your services.

363
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,370
Very well.

364
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:09,470
Welcome.

365
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:17,050
She pleases you?

366
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:21,020
Her name is Aixa.

367
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:23,550
Would you like to see her close up?

368
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,590
What for?

369
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,270
It's a beautiful body.

370
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,050
The body of a woman
who risks her life every night

371
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,580
coming to dance here.

372
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,140
She risks her life?

373
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:40,130
- Why?
- For money.

374
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,040
She risks her life so as not to die,

375
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:44,610
to go on living.

376
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,580
Don't you know
the Moors are persecuted?

377
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,430
She's a Moor?

378
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:52,130
A king's daughter.

379
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,350
Would you like to see all of it?

380
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,150
He's been so long.
What if something has happened?

381
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:09,890
- Your worries are unfounded.
- He's been gone for five hours.

382
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:13,280
The king forgets everything
when he goes hunting.

383
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:15,170
Hunting!

384
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:18,050
You think he's hunting?

385
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:19,400
Undoubtedly.

386
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:23,400
- Elvira.
- Madam.

387
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,930
Philip is unfaithful.

388
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:34,460
You like tormenting yourself.

389
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,480
You know that the king
has often betrayed me.

390
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:41,930
Say you won't scold me,

391
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:44,350
and I'll tell you
what I've recently learned.

392
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:46,240
Speak, Madam.

393
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:54,370
No, it isn't him.

394
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:04,770
You were saying?

395
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:12,560
The king goes out every afternoon,

396
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,750
and he doesn't come back
for at least three hours.

397
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:18,920
I had my page Hernán follow him.

398
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:21,000
Where did the king go?

399
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:23,270
You will never guess.

400
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:27,040
He went to a mansion
known to be a place of sin.

401
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:29,930
Are you sure it was the king?

402
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:33,350
Yes, yes, yes!

403
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,590
Would to God
I were mistaken, Elvira!

404
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:39,850
Madam, think. There can only be
the lowest of women in that place.

405
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:43,120
And what? They're still women
like us, aren't they?

406
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:45,610
Don't they have the same
between their legs as we do?

407
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:50,280
He's here!

408
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:53,990
He's here!

409
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:29,780
I was worried.

410
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,130
Joan, please.

411
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,090
- Tell me if you're unfaithful.
- What do you mean?

412
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:39,680
I know you visit
a house of ill repute.

413
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:43,510
Speak.

414
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,950
Answer me. At least
take the trouble to lie.

415
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:49,130
It's impossible for us
to live in peace.

416
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:56,020
Tell me you're faithful.

417
00:48:56,210 --> 00:48:57,160
Trust your husband.

418
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:00,940
Tell me you're faithful.

419
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,360
- Tell me and I'll believe you.
- My dearJoan,

420
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,580
you worry me.

421
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:08,630
You ask too much of me
with your rages.

422
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:28,370
I want to be yours.

423
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,440
I want to love you
even if you loathe me.

424
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:07,510
Whatever I say?

425
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:12,790
Whatever you say.

426
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:21,590
Your Flemish gentleman.

427
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:28,730
He tries to conceal who he is,
but his appearance gives him away.

428
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,750
Dress as what you are.

429
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:35,860
Make him dream of heaven,
but don't grant it to him.

430
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:39,540
If I am heaven, how can I refuse
it to him? He's relentless.

431
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:45,790
- Just a little piece.
- This little piece.

432
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:52,180
- In any case, don't kiss him.
- Not as I kiss you.

433
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:23,900
Hell of Satan and Beelzebub,

434
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,850
Raging fire of corpses,

435
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:30,450
forces of the air, of the earth,
of the sea and of fire,

436
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,540
I call on you.

437
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:35,580
If it is true that you have
more power than humankind,

438
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:38,140
come to my aid, here and now.

439
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:49,210
Satan, Asmodeus
and your thousand names.

440
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:57,180
How much do you need?

441
00:51:57,410 --> 00:52:00,220
- 500 escudos.
- Speak to Lord de Veyre.

442
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:31,260
Halt!

443
00:52:31,970 --> 00:52:33,280
State your name.

444
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,200
Captain Santos Fernández Corrales.

445
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,340
You're under arrest.
Your weapons.

446
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:41,210
Follow us.

447
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:13,210
Your bow isn't very tense today.
What's wrong?

448
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:18,560
My heart belongs to you, Madam.

449
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:22,620
You bring peace to my senses,

450
00:53:24,010 --> 00:53:25,860
and I could not do without you,

451
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:28,390
but I have to leave for Burgos.

452
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:31,790
- With the monarchs perhaps?
- Yes.

453
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:33,560
With the monarchs.

454
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:35,900
Follow me,

455
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:38,980
and ask in exchange
whatever you may desire.

456
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:43,170
A house, possessions, servants,

457
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:46,170
and even an allowance.

458
00:53:46,610 --> 00:53:49,420
- Are you a friend of the king?
- More than a friend.

459
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:51,980
You could say that the king and I

460
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:54,540
are one and the same person.

461
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,260
I want to be a lady-in-waiting.

462
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,480
Don't you want to have me near?

463
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:31,650
It's dangerous.

464
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:33,760
For me or for you?

465
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:36,560
For both of us.

466
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:42,380
Whether here or in Burgos,
I need protection,

467
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:43,980
exposed as I am

468
00:54:44,170 --> 00:54:47,040
to the rumors and condemnations
of the townspeople.

469
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:48,710
I am a Moor.

470
00:54:56,590 --> 00:54:58,530
The only protection I have

471
00:54:59,410 --> 00:55:01,740
is that offered by Captain Corrales.

472
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:10,660
Before you spill forth,
I demand an answer.

473
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:12,970
Whatever you want.

474
00:55:35,470 --> 00:55:38,090
It is September, 1506,

475
00:55:38,350 --> 00:55:40,010
when the new sovereigns of Castile

476
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:42,030
make their entrance into Burgos.

477
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:08,910
- Ana Sainz de Torrijos.
- Amalia Zapico.

478
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:12,210
- Cristina de Acevedo.
- Beatriz de Bobadilla.

479
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,190
María del Llano Vilches.

480
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,590
They are too beautiful.

481
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:23,820
They have been chosen
from the most noble families,

482
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:25,190
as is fitting.

483
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:29,970
Very well.

484
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:35,600
Welcome.

485
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:39,310
I wish the Castilian court
to be noted for its austerity.

486
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:42,980
Extravagant hairstyles
and ostentatious garments

487
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:44,270
are forbidden.

488
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:46,760
I want simplicity.

489
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:50,030
You may leave.

490
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:33,840
Are you happy?

491
00:57:35,090 --> 00:57:35,890
Very.

492
00:57:36,570 --> 00:57:38,160
The people love us.

493
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:41,460
The people are delighted to have
a king as handsome as you.

494
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:45,560
And so am I.

495
00:58:05,970 --> 00:58:06,900
Come.

496
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:09,040
Put your hand here.

497
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:16,850
It's moving.

498
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:33,620
Tell my father that if it's a boy,
I'll call it after him.

499
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:40,210
Kiss me.

500
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,570
The King of Castile.

501
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:13,210
Can Parliament really decide
who governs Castile?

502
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:16,220
Officially, yes.

503
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:19,800
But the effect
of this meal on our mood

504
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,860
will be more influential.

505
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:25,630
You and I shall decide.
I abandon Castile unconditionally.

506
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:28,030
I want to attend
to my affairs in Italy.

507
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:36,900
Germaine, who was reared at
the effeminate French court,

508
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,190
is not adapting to being
the wife of Ferdinand of Aragon.

509
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:42,300
She finds us coarse and austere.

510
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:48,860
I want a son.

511
01:00:50,050 --> 01:00:53,250
The doctors say that a woman's
womb can refuse to procreate

512
01:00:53,470 --> 01:00:55,810
when there's a lack of affection
around her.

513
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:58,430
They may be right.

514
01:01:05,770 --> 01:01:07,480
Also, why should I hide it?

515
01:01:07,710 --> 01:01:10,050
My marriage to Germaine
did not please Castile.

516
01:01:10,850 --> 01:01:13,220
They accuse me of betraying
Isabella's memory.

517
01:01:17,770 --> 01:01:19,110
Tell me aboutJoan.

518
01:01:24,130 --> 01:01:28,120
Joan is pregnant again.
She is in good health but is prone

519
01:01:28,350 --> 01:01:30,460
to certain obsessions,
to outlandish behavior.

520
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:33,180
Save your excuses.
My daughterJoan is mad.

521
01:01:36,650 --> 01:01:38,300
How do you think I should act?

522
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:42,650
You want to exclude her
from government,

523
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:44,860
and I don't object.

524
01:01:45,090 --> 01:01:47,170
I have said so
to your father, the emperor.

525
01:01:51,050 --> 01:01:54,010
Perhaps you should see her
in Burgos and judge for yourself.

526
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:57,500
No, I don't want to see her
in that state.

527
01:01:58,570 --> 01:02:01,660
Moreover, it would be cruel
to confront her with Germaine.

528
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:04,540
But, I admit,

529
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:08,580
it's also unfair to prevent
Germaine from meeting

530
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:11,110
her stepdaughter,
the mad queen of Castile.

531
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:12,300
More wine?

532
01:02:25,930 --> 01:02:26,860
De Veyre...

533
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:30,340
Do you believeJoan is mad?

534
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:33,830
It suits Don Ferdinand
that his daughter is mad.

535
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:39,340
And do you believe
that it also suits me?

536
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:41,060
That is not the question.

537
01:02:41,710 --> 01:02:45,930
Who does Joan want for king?
Her father or her husband?

538
01:02:46,990 --> 01:02:49,290
For the moment, you have
the father's permission

539
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,620
to declare that
his daughter is mad.

540
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:54,160
Congratulations, Sire.

541
01:03:17,330 --> 01:03:18,470
Leave us, Elvira.

542
01:03:25,810 --> 01:03:26,890
Come here.

543
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:37,860
You are frozen.

544
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:40,970
- Do you feel unwell?
- No, Madam.

545
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:43,170
Beatriz...

546
01:03:44,310 --> 01:03:46,240
- Are you jealous?
- I don't know.

547
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:49,100
As all women are, I think,
Your Majesty.

548
01:03:49,490 --> 01:03:51,140
What do you think of jealousy?

549
01:03:52,110 --> 01:03:54,960
Jealousy accompanies love, Madam.
That's the saying.

550
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:57,680
I believe it's even more than that.

551
01:03:58,730 --> 01:04:01,070
I believe you aren't in love
if you aren't jealous.

552
01:04:03,410 --> 01:04:04,490
Come close.

553
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:08,950
Closer.

554
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:14,100
They say that you know a spell
for provoking jealousy.

555
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:15,620
No, Madam.

556
01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:26,150
Be still.

557
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:35,500
The hand of Fatima.

558
01:04:41,230 --> 01:04:41,930
Come.

559
01:04:51,730 --> 01:04:54,630
Look straight ahead.
Keep your eyes on the horizon.

560
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:57,130
Do you see that officer
commanding the guard?

561
01:04:58,700 --> 01:04:59,950
What do you think of him?

562
01:05:00,850 --> 01:05:02,540
He seems handsome, Madam.

563
01:05:05,810 --> 01:05:08,660
He and I played at games
which were not so innocent.

564
01:05:10,580 --> 01:05:12,880
We invoked Venus with a spell.

565
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:25,230
My God!

566
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:28,710
Why am I telling you this?

567
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:32,560
I've only known you for a few days.

568
01:05:34,610 --> 01:05:35,590
Beatriz...

569
01:05:36,860 --> 01:05:40,270
- Swear that you will be discreet.
- I swear, Majesty.

570
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:42,160
Not a word to Elvira.

571
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:46,090
- She's such a grouch.
- As you wish, Madam.

572
01:05:46,290 --> 01:05:48,270
And not a word to your uncle
Juan Manuel.

573
01:05:48,470 --> 01:05:49,680
No, Madam.

574
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:52,080
I'm going to put Philip to the test.

575
01:05:54,610 --> 01:05:55,920
Will you help me?

576
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:59,310
- Yes, Madam.
- Your spell.

577
01:06:00,150 --> 01:06:01,390
Cast your spell.

578
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:37,520
Is something worrying you, Sire?

579
01:06:38,780 --> 01:06:41,390
No. It's nothing.

580
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:24,730
- Are you feeling better, Sire?
- I'm well, thank you.

581
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:37,940
We must talk.

582
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:57,620
Come in.

583
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:17,140
You dare to come here,

584
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:20,350
and instead of reproaching you
I'm trembling with joy.

585
01:08:21,820 --> 01:08:25,050
I bring a message from the queen.
She's waiting for you. She wants

586
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:26,260
to make you jealous.

587
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:29,300
I am already jealous,

588
01:08:29,730 --> 01:08:32,510
but of her, because she has
more time with you than I.

589
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:35,700
I fear that, like the queen,
we have all lost our reason.

590
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:03,960
Alvaro de Estúniga.

591
01:09:06,470 --> 01:09:08,250
I hear you have been in Italy.

592
01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:11,350
Yes, Majesty,
fighting the enemies of Spain.

593
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:15,170
Gonzalo de CÕrdoba is
the best captain in the world.

594
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:18,390
What he would give to hear you
say those words, Your Highness.

595
01:09:42,150 --> 01:09:45,240
How long is it since you said
farewell to me in Laredo?

596
01:09:47,050 --> 01:09:49,630
August, 1496, Majesty.

597
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:20,510
Why are you trembling?
It isn't the first time I've kissed you.

598
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:23,300
Have you forgotten?

599
01:10:24,710 --> 01:10:26,370
You don't forget
what marks you for life.

600
01:10:27,010 --> 01:10:28,290
We were children.

601
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,680
Tell me, what do you think of me now?

602
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:33,090
Now,

603
01:10:33,510 --> 01:10:35,170
you are the queen, Madam.

604
01:10:41,860 --> 01:10:43,870
Your father was my Latin teacher.

605
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:47,070
Do you remember the words
you said to me one day?

606
01:10:49,870 --> 01:10:50,880
In Latin.

607
01:10:54,090 --> 01:10:56,610
Animula vagula, blandula.

608
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:58,910
Do you remember?

609
01:11:00,390 --> 01:11:03,050
Little, wandering and tender soul.

610
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:05,730
I became enraptured...

611
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:12,840
Come here.

612
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:21,770
Sit down.

613
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:31,880
Put your hand on mine.

614
01:11:36,370 --> 01:11:37,770
Obey your queen.

615
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:46,010
That's it.

616
01:11:47,570 --> 01:11:48,490
Very good.

617
01:11:50,730 --> 01:11:52,740
Don't take it away until I tell you.

618
01:11:53,290 --> 01:11:54,370
Whatever happens.

619
01:12:28,590 --> 01:12:30,560
Apparently, the soldiers
of the Great Captain

620
01:12:30,790 --> 01:12:32,970
do not aspire only
to great exploits with arms.

621
01:12:42,670 --> 01:12:45,420
And I regret that you cannot
even blush with shame.

622
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:47,180
Sire.

623
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:53,680
- I can assure you that...
- Silence!

624
01:12:56,050 --> 01:12:58,920
I give you three days
to leave Burgos.

625
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:00,390
Go back to Italy

626
01:13:01,170 --> 01:13:02,470
and ask the Captain

627
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:04,710
to give you the most
dangerous missions.

628
01:13:15,370 --> 01:13:16,360
Forgive me.

629
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:20,470
I don't understand, Madam.

630
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:23,530
The king is jealous.

631
01:13:27,860 --> 01:13:28,840
Wait.

632
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:36,490
You couldn't have served
your queen better in Italy.

633
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:38,630
Thank you.

634
01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:53,170
Elvira!

635
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:56,010
Elvira!

636
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,270
Elvira, come and embrace
your queen!

637
01:14:00,430 --> 01:14:01,650
Oh, Elvira.

638
01:14:03,030 --> 01:14:05,970
He has banished Alvaro de Estúniga
to keep him away from me.

639
01:14:06,930 --> 01:14:09,650
Yes, Elvira, he's furious, he's jealous.

640
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:11,620
The king is jealous!

641
01:14:13,270 --> 01:14:14,250
Jealous.

642
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,490
I made him jealous.

643
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:18,930
I'm so happy!

644
01:14:22,230 --> 01:14:23,210
What's wrong?

645
01:14:26,710 --> 01:14:28,400
May I speak, Majesty?

646
01:14:29,010 --> 01:14:30,420
What news do you bring?

647
01:14:30,620 --> 01:14:31,560
Madam,

648
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:34,580
for several days now, the Moor...

649
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:37,630
No, be quiet.
I don't want to know any more.

650
01:14:38,610 --> 01:14:41,000
Go away, I shall
reward your services.

651
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:02,570
Speak.

652
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:06,770
Madam, what I have to say
will grieve you deeply.

653
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:10,800
Continue.

654
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,490
The Moor is not in Tudela
as Your Highness believes.

655
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:16,010
Where is she?

656
01:15:20,180 --> 01:15:22,320
I know that you know.

657
01:15:23,130 --> 01:15:24,030
Where is she?

658
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:28,400
She wrote a letter which was
secretly delivered to the king.

659
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:30,610
On receipt of the reply
she came to Burgos.

660
01:15:34,940 --> 01:15:37,430
I cannot enjoy one day of peace.

661
01:15:40,190 --> 01:15:41,650
The Moor in Burgos.

662
01:15:44,410 --> 01:15:46,000
A letter to the king.

663
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:48,660
She wrote to the king!
You hear, Elvira?

664
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:53,010
- You know its contents?
- Yes, Majesty.

665
01:15:53,980 --> 01:15:55,050
Do you have it?

666
01:15:58,580 --> 01:16:00,210
Give it to me.
Give me that letter!

667
01:16:06,590 --> 01:16:07,600
Leave us.

668
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:13,010
Do not read it.

669
01:16:13,370 --> 01:16:14,420
Not read it?

670
01:16:16,580 --> 01:16:19,360
Not read it?
You have never been in love!

671
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:22,170
You've never been jealous,
you're heartless!

672
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:24,820
Look at how I obey you.

673
01:16:27,770 --> 01:16:30,290
"Sire, you granted my wish

674
01:16:30,490 --> 01:16:32,950
to be one of the queen's ladies."

675
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:43,060
And the king answered.

676
01:16:45,050 --> 01:16:46,640
And that woman is here.

677
01:16:47,550 --> 01:16:50,000
And because she is beside me,
Philip is here too.

678
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:51,610
- Madam...
- Be quiet!

679
01:16:52,730 --> 01:16:56,410
- Granada is far away.
- Flanders is farther, believe me.

680
01:16:56,710 --> 01:16:57,650
De Veyre...

681
01:16:58,980 --> 01:16:59,930
Excuse me.

682
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:04,370
Sire.

683
01:17:06,590 --> 01:17:07,540
Come in.

684
01:17:31,450 --> 01:17:33,590
Where did she get such strength?

685
01:17:35,740 --> 01:17:37,510
She's more nervous than ever.

686
01:17:37,890 --> 01:17:40,090
Now she wants to make me jealous.

687
01:17:40,670 --> 01:17:42,940
She watches you like a child.

688
01:17:47,710 --> 01:17:49,620
It is she who is jealous.

689
01:17:57,670 --> 01:17:58,750
She is mad.

690
01:18:03,070 --> 01:18:04,980
Do not say that about the queen.

691
01:18:05,470 --> 01:18:07,520
It's my duty to tell you
the truth, Sire.

692
01:18:10,790 --> 01:18:11,830
If you insist...

693
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:14,110
What is the truth?

694
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:17,720
The queen is mad,
as was her grandmother,

695
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:19,870
Isabella of Portugal.

696
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:22,020
And, if you allow me, Sire,

697
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:24,320
as was her mother,
Isabella of Castile,

698
01:18:24,870 --> 01:18:27,840
whose fanaticism and obstinacy
you cannot doubt.

699
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:32,220
You are not in Flanders now.
Don't say that in Castile.

700
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,260
Sire, if I dare speak to you
like this, it is with the hope

701
01:18:36,450 --> 01:18:39,550
that you will finally assume
your mission as sovereign

702
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:42,940
and free Castile from the burden
of superstition and fanaticism.

703
01:18:43,140 --> 01:18:44,090
Be quiet.

704
01:18:45,190 --> 01:18:46,560
Be quiet, please.

705
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:07,940
My lord de Villena, I suppose
you are aware of everything.

706
01:19:08,770 --> 01:19:11,530
She is known by
the assumed name of Beatriz.

707
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:15,530
But her real name is Aixa,
a Moorish name. Nothing else.

708
01:19:15,780 --> 01:19:18,720
Even Philip is unaware
of her true condition.

709
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:20,390
It doesn't matter.

710
01:19:20,580 --> 01:19:22,490
Henceforth, she is my niece Beatriz.

711
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:24,680
My niece, by order of the king.

712
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:28,200
Only the king can bring
his mistress to the palace.

713
01:19:38,670 --> 01:19:39,620
My lords.

714
01:19:47,980 --> 01:19:51,420
I am sure you will
all fulfill the promise,

715
01:19:51,630 --> 01:19:54,270
which you sealed at the time
with your signatures,

716
01:19:54,470 --> 01:19:58,980
to protect the king should it be
necessary to put away Queen Joan

717
01:19:59,170 --> 01:20:02,470
and the people did not approve
of that serious decision.

718
01:20:03,020 --> 01:20:04,000
Well.

719
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:08,270
The king has decided
to confine his unhappy wife

720
01:20:08,750 --> 01:20:12,320
and duly informs the noblemen
of Spain through my person.

721
01:20:15,810 --> 01:20:17,640
The king-archduke's insistence

722
01:20:18,660 --> 01:20:20,550
could lead to terrible ills.

723
01:20:20,780 --> 01:20:23,140
His Majesty is doing
what he must, Admiral.

724
01:20:24,010 --> 01:20:27,070
The ambition of certain Flemish
nobles, led by you,

725
01:20:27,850 --> 01:20:30,020
is to give Philip
the throne of Castile.

726
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:32,970
That is the question here,
and none other.

727
01:20:33,190 --> 01:20:34,890
What you call ambition

728
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:37,540
is simply good sense.

729
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:39,250
Moderate your words, Admiral.

730
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:43,040
If Queen Joan is unfit to reign,
to who else but him

731
01:20:43,270 --> 01:20:46,480
does the crown belong
while Prince Charles is not of age?

732
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:49,190
Only Parliament can decide
on such an important matter.

733
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:53,920
Valladolid recognized Isabella
and Ferdinand's daughter

734
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:55,270
as queen of Castile.

735
01:20:56,820 --> 01:20:58,980
Will you permit usurpation

736
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:00,480
and injustice?

737
01:21:04,940 --> 01:21:06,890
Those who do not fear Philip's anger

738
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:10,380
accompany me to an audience
with the queen.

739
01:21:10,870 --> 01:21:13,230
You will see that
those who say she is mad

740
01:21:13,510 --> 01:21:16,520
are mistaken or are lying.

741
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:33,480
Madam, the noblemen
wish to speak with you.

742
01:21:35,510 --> 01:21:36,520
What shall I tell them?

743
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:42,190
Shall I send them away?

744
01:21:46,550 --> 01:21:48,000
I am calmer now.

745
01:21:49,870 --> 01:21:50,920
Show them in.

746
01:22:03,980 --> 01:22:04,910
My lords...

747
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:17,970
A painful duty brings us
before you, Madam.

748
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:20,080
- What is it?
- The kingdom

749
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:23,570
is under great threat
and only you can prevent it.

750
01:22:24,630 --> 01:22:25,550
Speak.

751
01:22:27,150 --> 01:22:29,680
The king is abusing the affection
of his faithful wife.

752
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:31,280
That is so, Admiral.

753
01:22:31,820 --> 01:22:34,030
The king is the most iniquitous of men.

754
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:37,450
- Is it possible?
- God in Heaven!

755
01:22:37,710 --> 01:22:38,640
I did not say that.

756
01:22:38,860 --> 01:22:40,460
No matter! I say it.

757
01:22:43,930 --> 01:22:46,070
The Flemish are plundering Castile.

758
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:48,590
Your people are going hungry.

759
01:22:49,110 --> 01:22:51,280
It's the eternal hunger, Sire.

760
01:22:52,910 --> 01:22:53,850
At last.

761
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:58,290
- Are they all here?
- Beatriz was not in her room.

762
01:22:58,490 --> 01:22:59,860
They are looking for her.

763
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:03,180
Madame de Torrijos,

764
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:04,810
write something here.

765
01:23:16,350 --> 01:23:17,650
Did you hear me, Madam?

766
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:20,530
The fate of the kingdom could
depend on this discussion.

767
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:24,470
We are here as representatives
of the assembly of nobles.

768
01:23:24,660 --> 01:23:25,870
Yes, I am listening.

769
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:28,560
You said the people were
going hungry. Continue.

770
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:29,710
The king,

771
01:23:29,910 --> 01:23:32,760
backed by some noblemen,
is claiming that your state of...

772
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:36,690
It isn't you.
Maria del Llano, your turn now.

773
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:40,430
Is their writing so important?

774
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,670
- More than anything.
- More than saving a kingdom?

775
01:23:42,870 --> 01:23:44,300
More than that.

776
01:23:46,490 --> 01:23:48,250
Nor is it you.

777
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:49,740
You, Amalia.

778
01:23:50,420 --> 01:23:51,850
Madam, listen to me.

779
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,070
Some doubt your capacity to rule.

780
01:23:54,590 --> 01:23:55,830
You must rule

781
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:57,720
- and clarify matters.
- Yes, later.

782
01:23:58,270 --> 01:23:59,750
It isn't you, either.

783
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:03,420
- The king is plotting against you!
- How dare you!

784
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:05,550
- He wants to help Castile.
- Cristina de Acevedo.

785
01:24:06,810 --> 01:24:08,690
- Why aren't you writing?
- I don't know how to.

786
01:24:08,890 --> 01:24:11,790
You don't know how to write?
Untrue, gentlemen!

787
01:24:12,830 --> 01:24:15,580
Do you believe this lady
does not know how to write?

788
01:24:23,510 --> 01:24:24,620
Get out of here.

789
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:28,220
Out, out, out.

790
01:24:37,110 --> 01:24:38,520
Where is Beatriz?

791
01:24:41,050 --> 01:24:42,070
Send her to me.

792
01:24:45,750 --> 01:24:47,640
But she is our queen, gentlemen.

793
01:24:47,830 --> 01:24:50,810
You've seen and heard it.
Can you deny the evidence?

794
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,150
Could she be madder?

795
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:07,930
Come here, Beatriz.

796
01:25:09,090 --> 01:25:12,570
- Write whatever comes to mind.
- You know it isn't necessary.

797
01:25:28,150 --> 01:25:30,610
- Is this your letter?
- It is mine.

798
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:33,820
You are frank, at least.

799
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:36,760
What have you done to the king?

800
01:25:37,250 --> 01:25:38,840
What spell did you cast on him?

801
01:25:40,290 --> 01:25:41,240
The king loves me.

802
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:43,510
The king loves all
who flatter his instincts.

803
01:25:43,710 --> 01:25:45,370
The king loves me,
and I love the king.

804
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:46,620
Be quiet!

805
01:25:48,350 --> 01:25:50,880
Kneel down before
the queen of Castile!

806
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:56,260
- Kneel!
- The king hates you and loves me!

807
01:25:56,450 --> 01:25:58,040
I'll only kneel before him.

808
01:25:58,240 --> 01:25:59,900
I'm dreaming.
What is this slut saying?

809
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:02,050
I believe she is defying me.

810
01:26:02,270 --> 01:26:04,160
The king enjoys me, not you.

811
01:26:04,450 --> 01:26:06,200
You say that to my face?

812
01:26:07,130 --> 01:26:09,180
A queen can receive
no greater offense!

813
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:13,910
Soldiers!

814
01:26:14,110 --> 01:26:15,800
Attention! Line up!

815
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:17,860
Your swords!

816
01:26:24,510 --> 01:26:25,530
Defend yourself!

817
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:29,210
Defend yourself, or I'll have
to summon your master Satan!

818
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:31,200
Defend yourself!

819
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:34,770
God of vengeance,
destroy this witch!

820
01:26:35,140 --> 01:26:37,530
Kill her and her lover
with the black death!

821
01:26:37,730 --> 01:26:39,670
Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!

822
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:40,890
Kill her!

823
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:44,670
Madam, seeing you like this,
your enemies will be convinced

824
01:26:44,810 --> 01:26:45,980
that you are mad.

825
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,290
That is the sad heritage

826
01:26:51,490 --> 01:26:54,240
bequeathed by Isabella of Portugal
to her granddaughterJoan.

827
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:58,780
That queen was mad,
and the queen of Castile is also mad.

828
01:26:59,140 --> 01:27:02,720
That, my lords, is the sad truth
for me and for Castile.

829
01:27:05,540 --> 01:27:08,090
You may leave.
My thanks to all of you.

830
01:27:25,630 --> 01:27:26,620
Sire...

831
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:29,820
When you speak
in the assembly of nobles,

832
01:27:30,020 --> 01:27:32,470
you should do so
with the authority and resolve

833
01:27:32,740 --> 01:27:36,090
of one who is assuming government
because of the queen's incapacity.

834
01:27:39,940 --> 01:27:42,250
Excuse me, I don't feel well.

835
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:44,230
Should I summon the doctor?

836
01:27:45,570 --> 01:27:46,880
Leave me be.

837
01:27:48,010 --> 01:27:50,210
I want to rest.
I need to think.

838
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:39,460
Be seated.

839
01:28:48,140 --> 01:28:50,820
You know the sad reason
why we are gathered here.

840
01:28:51,890 --> 01:28:54,510
The queen is demented,
and is thus unfit to govern.

841
01:28:56,490 --> 01:29:00,110
We can extend her life only
by keeping her in close confinement.

842
01:29:04,140 --> 01:29:05,900
Are you ready, my lords,

843
01:29:06,730 --> 01:29:09,280
to announce publicly
that Queen Joan is mad,

844
01:29:11,050 --> 01:29:14,250
to recognize me as the only
legitimate sovereign of Castile,

845
01:29:15,950 --> 01:29:20,010
and, should my enemies foment
disturbance in the kingdom,

846
01:29:22,610 --> 01:29:25,060
to lend me whatever aid I may need?

847
01:29:28,980 --> 01:29:31,210
We shall all do
what Your Highness wishes

848
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:32,810
for the good of Castile.

849
01:29:33,770 --> 01:29:34,720
All of us.

850
01:29:35,690 --> 01:29:37,510
Is that not so, my lords?

851
01:29:38,580 --> 01:29:40,470
- Aye!
- That is so!

852
01:29:53,550 --> 01:29:56,000
Are you going to allow them
to toy with you?

853
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:58,410
To question your capacity to rule?

854
01:30:01,130 --> 01:30:03,440
They have stated that you are mad.

855
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:07,040
Do you know what that means?
They are saying the queen is mad.

856
01:30:08,010 --> 01:30:09,390
If only it were true.

857
01:30:11,190 --> 01:30:12,560
If only I were mad.

858
01:30:14,580 --> 01:30:16,490
If only it were the fruit of my madness

859
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:18,670
and not of my husband's treachery.

860
01:30:22,420 --> 01:30:23,430
Leave me.

861
01:30:25,330 --> 01:30:26,340
Halt!

862
01:30:26,580 --> 01:30:29,100
- I request an audience.
- You cannot go in, Sire.

863
01:30:29,330 --> 01:30:31,500
An audience in the name
of Heaven and Castile!

864
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:34,090
Let him come in.

865
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:46,700
Arise, Alvaro.

866
01:30:47,510 --> 01:30:48,480
What do you wish?

867
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:53,260
I am but an unworthy soldier,
but today I speak for the people.

868
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:56,590
They ask you not to give way
to the greed of the Flemish.

869
01:30:57,330 --> 01:31:00,970
There is a plot against you.
The king wants to dethrone you

870
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:02,790
and imprison you forever.

871
01:31:08,650 --> 01:31:11,690
He wants you off the throne,
and also out of your bed.

872
01:31:13,010 --> 01:31:14,900
A bed that another will soon occupy.

873
01:31:31,090 --> 01:31:33,710
This document recognizes
the queen's incapacity

874
01:31:33,970 --> 01:31:36,870
and authorizes you, Sire,
to order her imprisonment.

875
01:31:37,110 --> 01:31:38,870
Thus, all those here present,

876
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:41,580
constituting the assembly
of nobles of the kingdom,

877
01:31:41,940 --> 01:31:43,730
name you regent of Castile

878
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:46,290
until Prince Charles comes of age.

879
01:31:49,010 --> 01:31:50,380
Take the throne, Sire.

880
01:31:51,510 --> 01:31:54,000
We will solemnly take the oath
you demand of us.

881
01:31:55,740 --> 01:31:57,010
The crown is yours.

882
01:32:08,670 --> 01:32:09,970
Hail to the king!

883
01:32:14,550 --> 01:32:16,010
Hail to the queen of Castile,

884
01:32:17,530 --> 01:32:20,790
of Leon and Granada,
Seville, Galicia and Gibraltar,

885
01:32:20,980 --> 01:32:25,010
of Murcia, Jaen, the Canary Islands
and the new Atlantic lands,

886
01:32:25,210 --> 01:32:28,850
heir to the throne of Aragon
and archduchess of Austria!

887
01:33:11,130 --> 01:33:12,790
Why are you surprised?

888
01:33:14,650 --> 01:33:16,310
Were you not expecting me?

889
01:33:21,020 --> 01:33:23,250
I know you are dealing
with serious business.

890
01:33:35,510 --> 01:33:39,060
It has to do with locking me away
for the rest of my life.

891
01:33:40,830 --> 01:33:44,180
It has to do with bestowing
on Philip of Austria

892
01:33:44,820 --> 01:33:46,910
the crown which belongs to me alone.

893
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:51,100
It has to do with Castile.
It has to do with me.

894
01:33:54,180 --> 01:33:57,180
And knowing you had a grudge
against my poor, black dress,

895
01:33:57,630 --> 01:33:58,880
to make you happy,

896
01:34:00,350 --> 01:34:02,770
and to seem like a queen
to you, at least once,

897
01:34:03,580 --> 01:34:06,780
I have put on, as you see,
my most dazzling robes.

898
01:34:19,580 --> 01:34:20,830
Lord de Veyre...

899
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:26,200
You are responsible for having
inspired in this puppet

900
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:30,110
the senseless dream of becoming
the master of Castile.

901
01:34:30,310 --> 01:34:32,310
Your madness excuses you, Madam.

902
01:34:32,580 --> 01:34:34,270
Do not hide, my lord Juan Manuel.

903
01:34:35,230 --> 01:34:37,810
A descendant of
Saint Ferdinand the King

904
01:34:38,240 --> 01:34:41,240
covering up the excesses
of an archduke of Austria.

905
01:34:47,710 --> 01:34:50,260
You too have come here,
my lord Marquis of Villena,

906
01:34:50,660 --> 01:34:51,900
Duke of Escalona.

907
01:34:53,700 --> 01:34:55,870
Perhaps these gentlemen do not know

908
01:34:56,190 --> 01:34:58,620
that your ancestor
Diego LÕpez Pacheco

909
01:34:58,820 --> 01:35:01,820
was one of the assassins
of Lady Inés de Castro,

910
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:07,900
that your noble father
gave poison to Prince Alfonso,

911
01:35:09,860 --> 01:35:13,240
that you had your first wife killed.

912
01:35:13,450 --> 01:35:16,060
If Heaven would grant you
sufficient understanding,

913
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:19,800
you might see that you can offer
nothing but oppression to Castile.

914
01:35:21,350 --> 01:35:23,170
Yours is truly a glorious race!

915
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:28,050
I am well aware

916
01:35:28,260 --> 01:35:31,520
that these doctors here
want to lock me up as a lunatic.

917
01:35:33,630 --> 01:35:35,390
But I will not allow it.

918
01:35:41,290 --> 01:35:44,800
Kill people, my lords.
That is your right.

919
01:35:46,300 --> 01:35:48,610
But you may not yet bury them alive!

920
01:35:48,810 --> 01:35:50,040
Be quiet!

921
01:36:01,860 --> 01:36:04,160
This assembly has already
decreed your arrest.

922
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:07,960
As for you, Philip,

923
01:36:09,830 --> 01:36:10,780
what can I say

924
01:36:10,980 --> 01:36:12,120
to console you?

925
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:17,790
You are pale.

926
01:36:19,050 --> 01:36:20,800
Ambition is devouring you.

927
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:25,280
You need a lot of strength to act
in accordance with your greed.

928
01:36:25,470 --> 01:36:26,620
Enough, Madam.

929
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:30,340
Leave here.
Don't force me to use violence.

930
01:36:30,470 --> 01:36:31,580
Yes, by God!

931
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:34,590
It is time I began to reign!

932
01:36:37,390 --> 01:36:40,130
To love a man
is to love as all women do.

933
01:36:41,290 --> 01:36:45,510
A queen should love like God
and love an entire people!

934
01:36:56,840 --> 01:36:58,120
Open the doors!

935
01:37:12,840 --> 01:37:13,990
Marquis...

936
01:37:17,130 --> 01:37:18,630
Soldiers, break up that mob!

937
01:37:36,590 --> 01:37:38,620
What is it you want, Philip?

938
01:37:38,830 --> 01:37:41,580
My people have lost
their reason, as I have.

939
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:45,950
You see, we lunatics abound in Burgos.

940
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:50,600
God be with you, my lords.

941
01:37:52,180 --> 01:37:53,800
The mad queen salutes you.

942
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:39,540
Sire, I beg you.

943
01:38:40,370 --> 01:38:42,220
Pay heed to prudence and pity.

944
01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:46,280
Silence, Admiral!

945
01:38:47,320 --> 01:38:49,320
I promise you'll rue your temerity.

946
01:38:57,840 --> 01:38:58,790
Leave me.

947
01:38:59,310 --> 01:39:00,660
Leave me, my lords.

948
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:02,800
I want to be alone.

949
01:39:03,150 --> 01:39:04,780
I'll send you a palliative.

950
01:39:06,040 --> 01:39:10,410
The balm I need to recover
is all the blood of my enemies.

951
01:39:10,610 --> 01:39:11,820
Calm yourself, Majesty.

952
01:39:16,370 --> 01:39:17,520
Lord de Veyre!

953
01:39:19,120 --> 01:39:20,230
The proclamation.

954
01:39:20,850 --> 01:39:21,750
The proclamation.

955
01:39:22,830 --> 01:39:25,490
The proclamation
you prepared for the people.

956
01:39:27,570 --> 01:39:28,720
I want to sign it.

957
01:39:29,460 --> 01:39:30,440
Here, Sire.

958
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:32,690
Sign here.

959
01:39:34,610 --> 01:39:35,980
Here, here.

960
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:39,730
You don't want me as king.

961
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:44,050
You'll have me as tyrant.

962
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:55,290
Sire.

963
01:39:55,960 --> 01:39:56,880
Sire!

964
01:39:57,590 --> 01:39:58,630
Can you hear me?

965
01:40:01,110 --> 01:40:03,110
Have him taken to his apartments.

966
01:40:03,890 --> 01:40:05,360
He has to be bled.

967
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:30,580
My love...

968
01:40:33,270 --> 01:40:34,310
My love...

969
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:40,020
Your... forgiveness...

970
01:40:42,230 --> 01:40:46,250
Your... forgiveness, Joan.
To ease... my torment.

971
01:40:47,440 --> 01:40:48,500
I don't want...

972
01:40:48,730 --> 01:40:52,050
I don't... want to go...
without... your forgiveness.

973
01:40:52,730 --> 01:40:55,580
My love,
try to speak more clearly.

974
01:40:56,280 --> 01:40:57,660
I want to understand you.

975
01:41:01,750 --> 01:41:04,850
Madam, the contact with
the sheets will hurt him.

976
01:41:05,050 --> 01:41:06,100
Allow me.

977
01:41:12,150 --> 01:41:13,530
Bring me scissors.

978
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:17,260
My love.

979
01:41:19,830 --> 01:41:22,130
- Cold...
- Leave me alone.

980
01:41:22,360 --> 01:41:23,340
Cold...

981
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:26,200
- It's cold.
- Leave us.

982
01:41:31,930 --> 01:41:32,880
Joan...

983
01:41:33,810 --> 01:41:34,750
Joan...

984
01:41:36,410 --> 01:41:38,030
It's cold, Joan.

985
01:41:42,490 --> 01:41:43,640
Joan...

986
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:46,230
Joan...

987
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:53,460
Lord!

988
01:41:57,400 --> 01:41:58,780
You'll live, my love.

989
01:42:00,290 --> 01:42:01,740
My love, you'll live.

990
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:04,530
You'll live.

991
01:42:19,160 --> 01:42:20,240
Is there no cure?

992
01:42:21,090 --> 01:42:23,390
What can God's mercy not cure?

993
01:42:24,380 --> 01:42:27,450
You mustn't let your spirit
weaken. Trust in God.

994
01:42:27,990 --> 01:42:28,940
In God?

995
01:42:30,050 --> 01:42:33,050
And why not in you?
Are you not doctors?

996
01:42:34,050 --> 01:42:37,140
The king is young.
He is only twenty-eight.

997
01:42:41,690 --> 01:42:44,250
Would all my blood suffice
to revive his?

998
01:42:47,810 --> 01:42:49,530
Speak, for pity's sake.

999
01:42:50,620 --> 01:42:52,730
We have done
all that is in our power.

1000
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:54,210
It is adversity, Madam.

1001
01:42:55,290 --> 01:42:57,210
Its ways are unknown to us.

1002
01:43:03,360 --> 01:43:05,050
All I have for his life.

1003
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:06,910
My scepter for his life.

1004
01:43:08,220 --> 01:43:09,880
Let whoever covets a crown save him,

1005
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:12,190
give him back to me.

1006
01:43:12,770 --> 01:43:15,740
Do you know of no one
who cures this kind of illness?

1007
01:43:15,940 --> 01:43:18,140
A necromancer who works wonders?

1008
01:43:18,340 --> 01:43:20,250
Madam, ask the Almighty for help.

1009
01:43:23,750 --> 01:43:25,640
God doesn't want to hear me.

1010
01:43:26,370 --> 01:43:28,190
I can find pity nowhere.

1011
01:43:28,390 --> 01:43:31,650
Do not give in to despair, Madam.
Have courage.

1012
01:43:32,230 --> 01:43:34,780
Have courage? Have courage?

1013
01:43:35,100 --> 01:43:38,620
When your wife or child is dying,
I'll tell you to have courage!

1014
01:43:46,210 --> 01:43:48,350
God is taking him
because I love him too much.

1015
01:43:49,570 --> 01:43:52,500
I'll make amends.
I'll love him less if he lives.

1016
01:43:56,860 --> 01:43:59,450
What can I do?
Bring his mistress to him?

1017
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,970
Who knows?
Her presence might revive him.

1018
01:44:04,330 --> 01:44:05,660
What can love not do?

1019
01:44:06,370 --> 01:44:08,860
If I were dead and he called me,
I would answer.

1020
01:44:09,930 --> 01:44:11,640
Bring that woman at once!

1021
01:44:16,260 --> 01:44:17,300
SweetJesus!

1022
01:44:18,370 --> 01:44:19,640
What am I saying?

1023
01:44:25,930 --> 01:44:28,930
Queen Isabella,
my dearest mother,

1024
01:44:29,700 --> 01:44:32,860
if, as your people say,
God has you in His bosom,

1025
01:44:33,420 --> 01:44:36,510
intercede for this unhappy
daughter you left behind.

1026
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:40,190
Ask that Philip and I
may die together.

1027
01:44:51,780 --> 01:44:53,690
Madam, the king wishes to see you.

1028
01:45:23,910 --> 01:45:28,420
May God still grant me
a little strength

1029
01:45:30,090 --> 01:45:34,350
- so I can ask your forgiveness.
- Don't speak, Philip.

1030
01:45:40,100 --> 01:45:41,800
It's cold.

1031
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:45,210
Joan, it's cold.

1032
01:45:46,370 --> 01:45:47,550
Why?

1033
01:45:51,110 --> 01:45:53,700
Am I going to rot in an icy grave?

1034
01:45:56,070 --> 01:45:59,620
Or will waves of fire
rain down on me?

1035
01:46:00,650 --> 01:46:03,430
That's what I deserve for my sins.

1036
01:46:03,630 --> 01:46:06,760
No, you're wrong.
You're delirious.

1037
01:46:09,900 --> 01:46:11,110
Afraid...

1038
01:46:12,710 --> 01:46:13,700
I'm...

1039
01:46:15,630 --> 01:46:16,900
I'm afraid, Joan.

1040
01:46:20,710 --> 01:46:22,440
I'm afraid.

1041
01:46:24,750 --> 01:46:26,440
Give me your breath.

1042
01:46:27,910 --> 01:46:30,850
Put your lips on my forehead,

1043
01:46:32,300 --> 01:46:34,370
and forgive me.

1044
01:46:35,850 --> 01:46:39,340
- Your forgiveness, Joan.
- No, don't go.

1045
01:46:39,910 --> 01:46:42,050
Don't leave me, my love.

1046
01:46:43,470 --> 01:46:44,900
Tell me that you want to live.

1047
01:46:45,680 --> 01:46:47,980
Say it. Say...
I want to live, I want to live.

1048
01:46:49,420 --> 01:46:52,350
Say it, my love.
Say, I want to live.

1049
01:46:53,900 --> 01:46:54,840
Say it.

1050
01:47:03,530 --> 01:47:05,540
Is he going to die?

1051
01:47:07,270 --> 01:47:10,210
It would be best if you left, Madam.

1052
01:47:45,910 --> 01:47:48,390
Philip wanted to be buried
in Granada,

1053
01:47:48,810 --> 01:47:50,280
and to carry out this wish

1054
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:54,030
the queen set out across
the lands of Castile.

1055
01:47:55,150 --> 01:47:57,520
But the cortege didn't get very far.

1056
01:47:58,100 --> 01:47:59,280
In Torquemada,

1057
01:47:59,510 --> 01:48:03,110
it had to stop so thatJoan
could give birth to a girl,

1058
01:48:03,700 --> 01:48:06,550
the posthumous fruit
ofher passion for Philip.

1059
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:09,040
She would never reach Granada.

1060
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:18,640
Although Parliament never
took away her title of queen,

1061
01:48:18,860 --> 01:48:21,360
Joan, at the age of 28,

1062
01:48:21,560 --> 01:48:24,140
was shut away in the castle
of Tordesillas.

1063
01:48:25,230 --> 01:48:29,010
Philip's body was laid to rest
in a nearby monastery,

1064
01:48:29,580 --> 01:48:33,580
and Joan was allowed
to visit it from time to time.

1065
01:49:04,660 --> 01:49:06,520
Have pity, my love.

1066
01:49:08,950 --> 01:49:09,880
Have pity.

1067
01:49:31,830 --> 01:49:35,020
Almost half a century, 47 years,

1068
01:49:35,350 --> 01:49:37,870
were not enough for history,

1069
01:49:38,100 --> 01:49:40,720
imperturbable, unforeseeable,

1070
01:49:41,310 --> 01:49:44,950
to cloak Joan's heart with oblivion.

1071
01:49:46,360 --> 01:49:48,910
Did everything that
I remember happen?

1072
01:49:52,120 --> 01:49:54,160
Perhaps I will forget your name,

1073
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,970
but never the embrace that
caused me to moan with pleasure.

1074
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:59,000
FIN
