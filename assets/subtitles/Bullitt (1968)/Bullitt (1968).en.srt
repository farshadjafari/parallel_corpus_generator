1
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,630
<i>- This is Pete.
- Yeah?</i>

2
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,275
We lost him.

3
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,393
<i>He's your brother, Ross. If you can't
find him, we have people who will.</i>

4
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,196
<i>And you're paying for the contract.</i>

5
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,960
Excuse me.
Have you got a message for Mr. Ross?

6
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,268
What room, sir?

7
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,029
I'm not a guest.

8
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,599
- I'll check.
- Thanks.

9
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,389
- That's, Johnny Ross.
- Yes, sir.

10
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,919
Sorry, sir, nothing.

11
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,349
Nothing?

12
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,875
Are you sure?

13
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,234
I'm sure, sir.

14
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,194
Okay, thanks.

15
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,189
Thank you.

16
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,676
Yes, I'm sure it was him.

17
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,349
Sunshine Cab, 6912.

18
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,997
Would you pull up? I want to make a call.

19
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,990
Right.

20
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,236
Yeah?

21
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,755
Delgetti.

22
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,515
What is it?

23
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,635
<i>Work.</i>

24
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,632
Frank, let me in, will you?

25
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,713
What time did you get to bed
this morning, Frank?

26
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,835
About 5:00.

27
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,552
'"Mumps vaccine on the market.

28
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,198
'"The government authorized yesterday...

29
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,478
'"... what officials term the first clearly
effective vaccine to prevent mumps.

30
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,717
'"... announced it has granted
a license for the vaccine...

31
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,876
'"... at 12:45 Wednesday-'"

32
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,999
Why don't you just relax and have
your orange juice, and shut up, Delgetti?

33
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,273
Let's go, Frank.

34
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,195
Lt. Bullitt to see you, Mr. Chalmers.

35
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,998
It was purely unintentional, I assure you.

36
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,755
It wasn't that I was so well-informed,
it was just that he was so ill-informed.

37
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,229
Would you excuse me
for a moment, please?

38
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,152
What do you like about...?

39
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,474
In Orinda, we have all this beautiful
dry sunshine. Absolutely perfect for roses.

40
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,393
I do all my own work.
See my hands? They prove it.

41
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,438
Hello. Lieutenant, how are you?

42
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,560
Thanks for coming over.
Name is Frank, isn't it?

43
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,835
- That's right.
- Please call me Walter.

44
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,319
I have an important job for you.

45
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,675
Captain Bennet suggested that you take it.

46
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,230
As you know, there is a Senate
Subcommittee hearing here Monday.

47
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,948
I have a star witness
who needs protection.

48
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,668
Sam said that you were
the man for the job.

49
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,674
And I can't find a flaw in that statement.

50
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,239
Protection from who?

51
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,153
The Organization.

52
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,677
His name is Ross.
Johnny Ross. From Chicago.

53
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,270
Once and for all, the top men
in law enforcement are united.

54
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,875
We're going to expose the Organization.

55
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,393
I read your speech.

56
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,439
Why San Francisco?

57
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,394
Ross is safer here. That's your province.

58
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,475
Keeping him out of reach for 40 hours.

59
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,436
Where?

60
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,313
The Hotel Daniels.

61
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,233
226 Embarcadero Road. Room 634.

62
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,951
He's there now, expecting you.

63
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,791
Now that you know where my house is...

64
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,758
...I hope that we'll get to see
a lot more of each other.

65
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,308
Particularly in view of the investigation.

66
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,277
A senatorial hearing has a way of...

67
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,432
...catapulting everyone involved
into the public eye...

68
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,160
...with a subsequent effect on one's career.

69
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,675
It will be a pleasure to have you along.

70
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,190
Have him in court on Monday, Frank.

71
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,353
What was that all about?

72
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,111
Pals.

73
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,794
<i>You and Chalmers, huh?
There's a lot of juice?</i>

74
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,230
Hotel Daniels, 226 Embarcadero Road.

75
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,038
State's evidence witness,
and we're babysitting.

76
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,109
Let's go.

77
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,348
<i>- Yeah, who is it?
- Police.</i>

78
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,078
The roof and the exits.

79
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,396
Mr. Chalmers said you'd be here by 5:00.

80
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,708
He guaranteed me that.

81
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,030
Oh, sorry, we got held up in traffic.

82
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,313
Got any firearms?

83
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,633
No, man, I've got nothing on me.
Just my wallet...

84
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,633
...cigarette lighter.

85
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,354
Want to check me out yourself?

86
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,274
No, that's not necessary.
Put that stuff on the bed, will you, please?

87
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,039
How did you...
how did you get here from Chicago?

88
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,595
I flew.

89
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,237
Sure none of the boys were on the plane
with you, or saw you get on?

90
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,151
How would I know? I wouldn't know.

91
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,071
Why did you pick this room to hole up?

92
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,435
I didn't pick it. Chalmers picked it.

93
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,510
Why?

94
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,559
Stay away from those windows!
That's why.

95
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,230
Sit down and relax, Ross.
It's a long wait until Monday morning.

96
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,271
We'd better get a fix on some food.

97
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,316
- What?
- Some food.

98
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,790
I know Chalmers wants you to be happy,
and we'll do the best we can.

99
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,869
Dad, it's for you.

100
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,635
Listen, you're not going. You're not going.
We're going to a movie.

101
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,989
Hold it down. Hold it down.
Now, don't be too late.

102
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,552
- Hello.
- Hello. Captain?

103
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,391
Frank?

104
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,152
<i>We'll see you later, Dad.</i>

105
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,753
I've seen Chalmers.

106
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,634
What do you know about Ross?

107
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,392
Chicago. It could be very big.

108
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,393
<i>He had access to all the records. He ran
the wire services with his brother, Pete.</i>

109
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,118
Did Chalmers ask for me?

110
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,350
Uh-huh.

111
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,829
Do you happen to know why?

112
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,071
Yes, I know why.
He's grooming himself for public office.

113
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,597
<i>You make good copy.
They love you in the papers, Frank.</i>

114
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,755
I see.

115
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,510
Okay. So long, Sam.

116
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,672
Say, who were you talking to about me
on that telephone?

117
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,794
Mr. Chalmers said
this was just between me and him.

118
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,632
Me and him, and that's all.

119
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,754
Delgetti will take the first shift.
Stanton will be on at 12:00.

120
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,750
I'll take the third.

121
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,308
All you have to worry about is
to stay away from the windows.

122
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,719
Especially at night.

123
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,119
You call me before you leave.

124
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,315
Excuse me.

125
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,991
Fire escape and the freeway.

126
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,755
Bad news, right?

127
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,319
Right. Want me to stay?

128
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,118
No. Go on home to your wife.

129
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,269
What shift?

130
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,031
Second.

131
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,714
If we work on the weekend,
we get two days off?

132
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,109
So long.

133
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,313
- Hi.
- Hi.

134
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,032
Is this the new fountain?

135
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,877
Fountain? All the client can afford
is a leaky faucet!

136
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,799
I thought that,
money didn't matter to artists.

137
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,471
It costs money to have a soul.

138
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,032
'"Friction loss of water in feet
per hundred feet. Length of pipe...

139
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,874
'"Formula using constant one-hundred size
of standard pipe in inches. '"

140
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,117
I want to use
600 gallons of water per minute.

141
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,237
Now what's the velocity per second
of a five-inch pipe?

142
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,598
Look to the extreme right.

143
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,359
Now go down the figures
until you find 600.

144
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:16,996
Got it.

145
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,117
Now go across until you find
the five-inch pipe column.

146
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,875
What does it say?

147
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,313
Nine point eight.

148
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,237
Now I want the loss in feet.

149
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,195
Feet, huh?

150
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,470
Well?

151
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,393
I lost my place. Nobody's perfect.

152
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,799
May I use your phone, please?

153
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,791
Good evening. Right this way.

154
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,838
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

155
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,511
<i>- Yeah?
- Del?</i>

156
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,512
Coffee Cantata. 931-0770.

157
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,475
-931-0770.
- Right.

158
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,228
If a Sergeant Delgetti calls me...

159
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,312
...would you be kind enough
to let me know right away?

160
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,391
- I certainly will.
- Thank you.

161
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,312
Del. I'm coming off now.

162
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,515
Everything okay?

163
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,749
Yeah, sure.

164
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,317
Hey, hold it down, will you?

165
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,075
I'm sorry.

166
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,793
Anything for Stanton?

167
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,598
No, I'll see you tomorrow.

168
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,994
Who was it?

169
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,116
Del.

170
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,359
Something exciting?

171
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,109
Go to sleep.

172
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,476
Meaning you won't tell me anything.

173
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,832
It's not for you, baby.

174
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,231
Anything you do is part of me.

175
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,473
<i>Front desk. Two gentlemen.
Shall I send them up?</i>

176
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,033
What are their names?

177
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,513
<i>Hold on a minute.</i>

178
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,718
<i>Mr. Chalmers and a friend.</i>

179
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,916
Listen, tell them to wait.
And give me 421-7596.

180
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,913
<i>- Frank?
- Yeah.</i>

181
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,596
Chalmers is downstairs and another man.
They want to come up.

182
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,872
Chalmers, at one o'clock in the morning?

183
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,918
No, don't let them in.
I'll be there in five minutes.

184
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,277
Please, away from the door.

185
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,510
<i>Here are the latest baseball scores,just in.</i>

186
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,636
<i>In the National League,
San Francisco Giants...</i>

187
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,870
<i>...beat the Dodgers in both ends
of a double-header.</i>

188
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,635
<i>A 2-0 shutout in the twilighter
and 4-1 win in the nightcap.</i>

189
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,789
No, wait...

190
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,635
Now look.

191
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,519
They told me...

192
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,351
Who is it?

193
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,749
Ross. Two guys got him with a shotgun.

194
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,670
And Stanton?

195
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,751
They got him in the leg.
They're bringing him down.

196
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,159
Stick with Ross.

197
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,319
Soon as the lab men get out of 634, seal it.

198
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,595
- But seal it, Barney.
- Yes, sir.

199
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,070
How bad?

200
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,832
Bad. He's got a bleeder.

201
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,673
Door is not open.

202
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,239
Somebody screwed up.

203
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,912
They screwed up. The door's not open.

204
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,638
Somebody put the bed in.

205
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,998
I know you're hurting.

206
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,278
But I've got to know, now.

207
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,148
The two men.
Do you remember anything?

208
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,909
Caucasian.

209
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,237
The one who fired, about 5 foot 10.
White hair.

210
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,353
Gun, Winchester pump.

211
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,429
All I remember. Came in so fast.

212
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,989
Chain was off. He unlocked the door.

213
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,629
Who unlocked it?

214
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,154
Ross. Like he was expecting someone.

215
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,354
How is my leg?

216
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,432
Hold on, Carl,
we'll be there in a couple of minutes.

217
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,392
<i>Get out of the way.</i>

218
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,634
<i>To the right.</i>

219
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,233
<i>Let's go.</i>

220
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,793
Scissors, Jones.

221
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,631
<i>Somebody get the blood pressure.</i>

222
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,195
<i>Oxygen.</i>

223
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,798
<i>Can I have an ABD pad?</i>

224
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,634
Can you move your hand?

225
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,032
Say, do you want to step out? Your buddy
is all right. His leg should be okay.

226
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,713
Somebody get X-ray.

227
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,909
How's Stanton?

228
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,673
He'll be all right,
but he's busted up. Ross?

229
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,679
I don't know, Frank.

230
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,792
You better call Stanton's wife
and get her over here.

231
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,995
Okay.

232
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,110
Here you go.

233
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,031
What is it?

234
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,472
What's his blood pressure now?

235
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,595
Scissors.

236
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,119
It's down to 90 over 70.

237
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,871
Suture.

238
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,909
Scissors.

239
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,236
- Better let me tie this one.
- Okay.

240
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,158
<i>Get some balm, please.</i>

241
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,237
<i>He's dropping.
Pulse is also going up, now.</i>

242
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,958
What was it pre-op?

243
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,233
BP pre-op was 140 over 90.

244
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,594
Kahn, take this.

245
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,954
Now it's down to 90 over 70.

246
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,109
How much blood do you have?

247
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,272
We have four up here,
and we've ordered four more units.

248
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,198
How much have you given him?

249
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:23,319
- We're starting the first one right now.
- You'd better bring me another one.

250
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,194
Mayo, please.

251
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,198
- This is the subclavian.
- Here's your wipe, Doctor.

252
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,473
Thank you, Deanne.

253
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,313
What are his chances?

254
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,799
No more than 50-50.

255
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,515
We stopped the hemorrhaging, but they
got some of the major blood vessels.

256
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,999
Thank you, Doctor.

257
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,269
How is he doing?

258
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,429
Holding.

259
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,151
Stanton?

260
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,310
Okay. He's sleeping now.

261
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,398
I want to talk to you.

262
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,311
I got the report back from the lab.

263
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,868
Nothing at the hotel.
How come they got in?

264
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:30,191
Ross got to the door,
unhooked the chain from the inside.

265
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:35,314
He let the killers in himself?
Why would he do a thing like that?

266
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,872
I'm waiting to ask him.

267
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,515
What about the setup?
What do you think about that?

268
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,319
Shotgun and a backup man. Professionals.

269
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,229
Yep.

270
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,998
I had to call Chalmers.

271
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,436
And?

272
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,279
It didn't go down too good.
It's the main event for him.

273
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,476
<i>You know,
the Senate Subcommittee hearing.</i>

274
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,074
<i>He can't produce the big surprise
he promised everyone.</i>

275
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:10,197
He may try to make up some mileage
by laying it on us.

276
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,751
Play it by the book from now on.

277
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,590
Does Chalmers run the case, or do I?

278
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,950
All I'm interested in is results.

279
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,311
Do whatever you think is best.

280
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,032
I'll try to back you up.

281
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,591
Excuse me, sir.
Are you the policeman who hasn't eaten?

282
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,749
Yes, ma'am.

283
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,673
- Thank you.
- Surely.

284
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,309
Where is he?

285
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,874
How is he, Doctor?

286
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,270
As well as can be expected.
He's still under the anesthesia.

287
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,429
I'm Walter Chalmers.

288
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:46,149
Is there any possibility of my getting
a deposition from Ross before Monday?

289
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,074
That's impossible to say at this time.
He may remain in shock.

290
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,708
I thank you for doing all you can, Doctor.

291
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,233
Get the supervisor.

292
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,590
Now, what went wrong, Lieutenant?

293
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,950
- Who else knew where he was?
- What?

294
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,992
Who else knew where he was?

295
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,518
What are you implying?

296
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,389
They knew where to look for him
and they used your name to get in.

297
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,838
Are you suggesting
I disclosed his whereabouts?

298
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,389
Somebody did.

299
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,792
And it didn't come from us.

300
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,992
That's hardly the issue.

301
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,358
Well, it certainly is.

302
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,640
I've got an officer with a family.

303
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,951
And he's shot up pretty bad.

304
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,835
And I've got a witness who can't talk.

305
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,311
I want to know about Ross.
What was the deal you made with him?

306
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,355
Deal?

307
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,598
Lieutenant, don't try
to evade the responsibility.

308
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,080
In your parlance, you blew it.

309
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,196
You knew the significance
of his testimony.

310
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,352
Yet you failed to take
adequate measures to protect him.

311
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,314
So to you it was a job. No more.

312
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,757
Were it more, and you had the dedication
I was led to believe...

313
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,158
You believe what you want.

314
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,517
You work your side of the street
and I'll work mine.

315
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,715
Lieutenant, I shall personally
officiate at your public crucifixion...

316
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,360
...if Ross doesn't recover
during the course of the hearing...

317
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,795
...so I can at least present his deposition.

318
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:41,919
And, I assure you, I shall not suffer
the consequence of your incompetence.

319
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,516
And even if there wasn't any...

320
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,677
...I'm rather certain
I can prove negligence on your part.

321
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,711
There may be another attempt on his life.

322
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,076
<i>I'll be back in the morning,
with my people.</i>

323
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,712
Thank you, Doctor.

324
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,034
I'd like to have Dr. Willard replaced.
I think he's too young and inexperienced.

325
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,678
I'd prefer my surgeon.

326
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,079
Inform the administrator.

327
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,388
But Dr. Willard is one of our-

328
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,948
I'd like him replaced, if you don't mind.

329
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:27,396
- I'll report this to our administrator.
- Thank you very much.

330
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,989
Doctor?

331
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,555
A relative of mine,
he's here with a gunshot wound.

332
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,551
Could you please tell me
where I can find him?

333
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,756
Why don't you try at the reception desk?

334
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,273
There's no one there.

335
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,397
He could be up on the second floor
in the emergency room.

336
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,675
Thanks, Doctor.

337
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,749
Yes?

338
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,509
Oh, Lieutenant. It's for you.

339
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,715
Thank you.

340
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:42,830
Yes?

341
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,480
Dr. Kenner. This probably isn't important...

342
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,796
...but a man asked me
whether a relative of his...

343
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,438
...with a gunshot wound
was in the hospital.

344
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,636
I thought you should know about it.

345
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,796
Was he about 5 foot 10? Gray hair?

346
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,034
I'm afraid I told him
that he was on the second floor.

347
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,155
Thank you.

348
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,795
Delgetti.

349
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,553
Our man is in the building.
He was tipped where to find Ross.

350
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,154
- You take the ground floor, okay?
- Got it.

351
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:20,908
Get in Ross's room. Nobody in
except Dr. Willard and the nurses.

352
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,871
There's a man down the stairs!

353
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,598
Polly, call Anesthesia
and bring the crash cart!

354
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,629
Doctor, there's a cardiac arrest in ICU.

355
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,429
Get Delgetti.
You and the patrolman cover the lobby.

356
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,350
Okay.

357
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,877
I can't get a blood pressure.

358
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,309
Go.

359
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,714
Do you want to defibrillate again?

360
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:32,158
Not now. Not with that complex.

361
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,036
- How much bicarb?
- Fifteen.

362
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,473
Go ahead. Push it in.

363
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,028
- Do you want some lactose?
- Draw some up.

364
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:46,670
- Any pupillary reaction?
- No. Dilated.

365
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,798
<i>Get some calcium up, too.</i>

366
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,151
<i>What's that now? What's he got?</i>

367
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,154
<i>No activity.</i>

368
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,431
<i>I need some more epinephrin.</i>

369
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,231
<i>Half a milligram, please.</i>

370
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,913
I need your help.

371
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,389
What is it?

372
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,433
I want this kept open.

373
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,398
If Chalmers finds out that Ross died,
he'll fold this up.

374
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,994
- I want the man who killed him!
- I understand.

375
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,672
I don't want your head on a block.

376
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,954
I understand.

377
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,949
His chart could be misplaced.

378
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,997
You filed it. It's missing.
I'll take the responsibility.

379
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,349
All right.

380
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,072
Call the coroner's office.
Tell them to put Ross under a John Doe.

381
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:16,357
I want a private ambulance,
unmarked, and I want it quiet.

382
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,598
Far as you go, Doctor.

383
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,434
Take it slow.

384
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,915
City morgue.

385
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,515
Let's go.

386
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:54,989
Fresh today!

387
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,958
See if Dr. Willard is still in the hospital.

388
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:05,917
Get Lt. Bullitt on the phone.

389
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:15,237
I'm sorry, Joe.
He's been transferred to another room.

390
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,431
May I have an outside line, please?

391
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,829
May I speak to your supervisor, please?

392
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,592
I'm afraid she's busy at the moment.

393
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,797
I'd be grateful if you would tell her
that Chalmers wishes to see her.

394
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,836
Immediately. It's very urgent.

395
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,433
Yes, Mr. Chalmers.

396
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,114
<i>I'd like to speak with Dr. Willard, please.</i>

397
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:38,429
<i>Thank you.</i>

398
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,353
Yes? Can I help you?

399
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,432
I wanted the other supervisor.

400
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,829
The night supervisor went off duty
an hour ago.

401
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,990
I'm Mrs. Francis. May I help you?

402
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:00,914
You may, indeed. There was a patient
here. His name is Johnny Ross.

403
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:03,998
- And he seems to have disappeared.
- Disappeared?

404
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:08,358
He was in Intensive Care, but there's no
record of his whereabouts in the hospital.

405
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:09,839
That's impossible.

406
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,399
May I see his medical chart, please?

407
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,118
I'm sorry but hospital regulations-

408
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,351
It's an official police request.
Is it not, Captain Baker?

409
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,236
Yes, Captain. I'll take care of it.

410
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,919
Excuse me, but Dr. Willard
has gone off duty.

411
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,753
Call him at home.

412
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,871
Are you sure he's not there?

413
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,309
Do you have Dr. Willard's home number?

414
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,599
I'm sorry, but there has been...

415
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,830
...some medical complication
as regard to my witness.

416
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:41,639
I'm afraid I'll have to forego
that bedside picture...

417
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,837
...as much as it would've compensated
for his inability to testify tomorrow.

418
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:47,718
But, in all decency,
I can hardly force the issue.

419
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,350
Does this mean your surprise witness
won't be able to make any statement?

420
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,715
The man was near death
when he was brought in here.

421
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,438
In view of the attempt on his life...

422
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,511
...I'm sure you can understand
my reasons for secrecy.

423
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,989
- Yeah, of course.
- Good to see you again.

424
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:04,993
Can't reach Lt. Bullitt, either.

425
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,354
Keep trying.

426
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:11,108
I can't find Mr. Ross's medical chart.
It's evidently been misplaced.

427
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,997
- Or appropriated.
- Appropriated?

428
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:16,470
All right. I'll inform the administrator.
Thank you very much.

429
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,752
I want a complete list of the staff
who might've been involved...

430
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:24,195
...in helping Bullitt spirit Johnny Ross
out of here.

431
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,999
I'm certain he grabbed my witness
for his personal aggrandizement.

432
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,150
- I'll lay odds on that.
- And find Ross!

433
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,309
I'll get on that right away.

434
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,436
Mr. Chalmers, I have Lt. Bullitt.

435
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,433
Where's my witness?

436
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,394
I've got him.

437
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,629
Where is he?

438
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,031
Are you going to tell me or not?

439
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:50,110
Well, I can't at the present time.

440
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,159
Captain Baker would like
to have a word with you.

441
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,111
Now, listen to me, Lieutenant.

442
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,912
Nail him. I want him written off.

443
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,194
No problem.

444
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,878
You want some breakfast?

445
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:13,829
Just coffee.

446
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,269
Thank you.

447
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:07,915
For what?

448
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,830
- Is it open?
- The door's open, sir.

449
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,873
Now think back to the time the two
of them first came in and you saw them.

450
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,632
Anything you can remember?

451
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:54,510
Like I said. They hit me
before I got a chance to look at them.

452
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:57,234
I don't remember nothin' about them.
Nothin'.

453
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,719
Start remembering.

454
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:00,915
I can't!

455
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:03,199
And that's the honest truth.

456
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,191
Delgetti, take him downtown.

457
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,878
Lieutenant, give him a chance, will you?
He's trying.

458
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,791
He's not trying hard enough.

459
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,279
It will come to him.

460
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,872
You're wasting your time.

461
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:23,788
Okay. Come on.

462
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,635
One thing about the guy who hit me...

463
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,957
He had a square face.

464
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,636
There wasn't much light here.
They try to save on electricity.

465
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,189
Like this?

466
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,113
No. Thinner.

467
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:50,469
That's it.

468
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,513
Now it's coming back.

469
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:56,196
Let's go to the guy in 634. No luggage?

470
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:57,919
That's right, sir.

471
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:00,429
- And he didn't store anything?
- No, sir.

472
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,512
He came in empty, which means
you gave him a good look-over.

473
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,239
Always do.
They're the ones I give the eye to.

474
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,078
Then you saw how he arrived?

475
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,639
Yes, sir. In a cab.

476
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:10,869
What line?

477
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,228
Sunshine Cab.

478
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,589
Now, the guy who hit you.
How old was he?

479
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:18,954
Oh, about 50.

480
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:20,629
What was his hair like?

481
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,109
Gray. Getting bald. Bald on both sides.

482
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:24,676
That?

483
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:25,949
No, balder.

484
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,158
Am I helping you, sir?

485
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,238
I never had it so good.

486
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,591
His first stop was the Mark.

487
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:22,669
How long?

488
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:23,795
Not long.

489
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:26,232
Pull over there and wait.

490
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,354
<i>- Hello.
- Eddy?</i>

491
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:17,675
Dues time. I need some information
on a Johnny Ross. Chicago.

492
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,320
<i>Give me half an hour.
Meet you at Enrico's.</i>

493
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:22,590
Right.

494
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,835
- Two.
- Two what?

495
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:37,878
Calls. He called twice.
The second was long distance.

496
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,230
How do you know it was long distance?

497
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:42,717
He put in a lot of change.

498
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:13,752
Good morning, Sam.
I don't believe I've had the pleasure.

499
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:15,751
This is Mr. Chalmers.
My wife, Mrs. Bennet.

500
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,512
My son, Paul. My son, Tony.

501
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:18,874
Tony, how are you?

502
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,349
Would you mind if I had
just a moment alone with Sam?

503
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,839
No, of course not.

504
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,911
Must be difficult raising children
in the worid of today.

505
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:31,830
I presume Tony is a college student.

506
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,479
Yes, that's right.

507
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:36,830
I can well imagine the financial strain...

508
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:39,832
...of sending a boy to university
on the salary of a captain.

509
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:42,195
There's no reason why a man
with your potential...

510
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:45,192
...shouldn't move right up,
given the right support.

511
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:48,234
My family is waiting for me, Mr. Chalmers.

512
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,277
Bullitt abducted my witness.

513
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,271
He removed him from the hospital.

514
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:59,035
As his superior officer,
I've given him complete charge of the case.

515
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:01,714
If he's moving Ross around,
it's for a reason.

516
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:06,753
So you mean that you would not order
him to reveal where he's keeping Ross?

517
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:08,671
It's his case, Mr. Chalmers.

518
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:14,752
Captain, I'm serving you with
a writ of habeas corpus...

519
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:18,918
...making you responsible
for the delivery of Ross.

520
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:21,719
Duly observed...

521
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,038
...you have received it.

522
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:29,195
Now I need that witness
to prove his very existence.

523
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,756
Excuse me, sir. Dad, Mom is waiting.

524
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:36,638
Would you excuse us
for just another moment, Tony?

525
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:41,750
I don't choose to have people accuse me
of false promises...

526
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,831
...for the sake of cheap sensationalism...

527
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:47,196
...or to be compromised
by your lieutenant. Or castrated.

528
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:12,236
Wait for me. I won't be long.

529
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:06,470
According to my sources,
the Organization, Chicago branch...

530
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:09,913
...caught Johnny Ross
with his hands in the till.

531
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:11,519
They estimate he siphoned off...

532
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:14,717
...about two million bucks
while operating their wire service.

533
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:18,634
The story is they tried to get rid of him.
Friday night. Chicago.

534
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:20,629
Chicago?

535
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:24,350
He got away unharmed.
They believe he's hiding here in town.

536
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:26,518
How old is this information, Eddy?

537
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:29,797
Four hours. They're looking for him
all over town, Frank.

538
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:34,272
They've staked out the docks, the airport,
to keep him from leaving the country.

539
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,711
Anyone else trying for a hit?

540
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:39,517
Haven't heard of any such likelihood.

541
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,477
What about his brother, Pete?

542
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:42,754
In the clear.

543
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:46,039
Okay, Eddy. Thanks.

544
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,479
Anything I can do for you?

545
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:49,834
There is something.

546
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:52,639
Remember Zash-Zhoe?
They gave him three to five.

547
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:54,149
What is he in for?

548
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:55,958
Receiving stolen property.

549
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:57,835
I'll try.

550
01:01:58,560 --> 01:01:59,754
Thanks, Frank.

551
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:24,434
- Here you go.
- Take care, Lieutenant.

552
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,756
What the hell is going on here?

553
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,393
A high-speed pursuit!

554
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:16,189
Two men are killed. An officer in the
hospital. A witness almost murdered.

555
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:19,078
I want to know what's happening.
Let's hear it straight.

556
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:20,559
Here's the report.

557
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:25,915
Now, a man like Chalmers could be
a great help to the Department.

558
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:28,790
He could speak for us where it counts.

559
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:31,509
He could fight for us in the legislature.

560
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:34,508
Now, you have got to
turn over his witness.

561
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:37,469
Where's Ross?

562
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:41,912
Tell him! That's an order!

563
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:47,235
He's dead.

564
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:48,675
Dead?

565
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,233
He died last night.

566
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:51,635
After you moved him?

567
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:55,030
Before. I've got him downstairs
under a John Doe.

568
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:58,873
You are sick.

569
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:02,919
Smuggling a dead man out of a hospital.

570
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:07,396
And now two men killed
who may have had nothing to do with it.

571
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:09,550
The man I was chasing killed Ross.

572
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:11,631
How do you know? Did you see him?

573
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:14,154
Yes. He tried to nail me with a shotgun.

574
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:16,032
A Winchester pump.

575
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:22,915
The radio report said the two men
were burned beyond recognition.

576
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:27,873
Now all he's got are two dead men.
It would never hold up in court.

577
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:32,074
I've got one lead. I want to move on it.

578
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:39,997
'"Miss Dorothy Simmons.
Thunderbolt Hotel. San Mateo. '"

579
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:44,596
Ross called her person-to-person
from a phone in Unión Square...

580
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:46,989
...approximately nine hours
before he was killed.

581
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:49,878
So he called his girlfriend.
What does that prove?

582
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:04,197
This is Sunday. I'm going to hold that writ
until we come to work Monday morning.

583
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:18,315
Frank?

584
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:23,714
Go on. Get out.

585
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:39,915
Need a car.

586
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,468
Sorry, Lieutenant, there are no cars left.

587
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:46,832
Ms. Simmons doesn't answer.

588
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:48,319
What's her room number?

589
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,789
I'm sorry, we're not allowed to give...

590
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:54,077
Front. Take this gentleman
to Room 114, please.

591
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:26,555
Hello, Del?

592
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,877
Yeah. Yeah.

593
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:32,033
It's a strangulation.

594
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:04,233
I thought I knew you.

595
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:06,991
But I'm not so sure anymore.

596
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:12,669
Do you let anything reach you?
I mean, really reach you?

597
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:17,556
Or are you so used to it by now
that nothing really touches you?

598
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:19,631
You're living in a sewer, Frank.

599
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:21,314
Day after day.

600
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:26,791
That's where half of it is.
And we can't walk away from it.

601
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:31,189
I know it's there, but I don't have to
be reminded of the whole thing.

602
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:32,872
The ugliness around us!

603
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:37,035
With you, living with violence is a way of
life, violence and death.

604
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:47,795
How can you be part of it without
becoming more and more callous?

605
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:55,314
Your worid is so far from the one I know.

606
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:03,916
What will happen to us in time?

607
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:09,959
Time starts now.

608
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:23,348
- What do you got?
- Let's start with the cleaver.

609
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:27,115
One cleaver, approximately
eight inches in length.

610
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:30,832
Ms. Simmons' luggage
has just arrived from the airport.

611
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:31,750
Okay.

612
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:33,914
Where is it?

613
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:37,795
- Here you go.
- One pair of gold shoes...

614
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:38,835
Where is it from?

615
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:40,512
San Mateo Thunderbolt Hotel.

616
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:42,192
- And who from?
- Simmons.

617
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:43,829
And what do we have?

618
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:46,639
One yellow metal locket.
Yellow metal watch.

619
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:49,510
Pearl necklace. Put a hold on these.

620
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:21,319
We got a man here.

621
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:29,988
Dearborn Travel Agency in Chicago. Rome.

622
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:33,351
Look at all this literature!

623
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:41,792
What do you make out of that?
I thought she was alone.

624
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:44,553
She's got a guy, now.

625
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:53,789
New purse, still has a price tag in it.

626
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:06,879
Give me a bag, Tony.

627
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:21,074
Everything is new.
They weren't even away.

628
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:27,394
Passport? No passport. No tickets.

629
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:30,069
Yeah, I can't find any tickets, either.

630
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:40,510
Bingo!

631
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:44,510
What've you got?

632
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:45,630
Great.

633
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:50,431
'"Albert E. Renick. '"

634
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:53,997
Then who the hell is Simmons?

635
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:58,432
Look how much money he's got.

636
01:23:58,520 --> 01:23:59,714
Look at this.

637
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:06,713
This guy is loaded!

638
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:09,112
Well, we've got a Renick.

639
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:11,119
Wonder who Renick is?

640
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:15,398
Look what I came up with!

641
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,353
'"Dorothy Renick. '"

642
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:22,078
Okay. Drop it in.

643
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:26,152
We're getting warm. '"A.R.'"

644
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:29,078
How does that grab you?

645
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:35,630
Give me a bag, Tony.
Fingerprints on this stuff.

646
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:42,153
Let's wrap it up.

647
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:53,919
- Thanks, Tony.
- Okay.

648
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,158
No tickets, no passport.

649
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:05,515
Call Immigration in Chicago. Have them
wire Renick's passport applications.

650
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:08,398
- I'll get a fingerprint check on Ross, huh?
- Okay.

651
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:13,195
<i>There are multiple gunshot wounds
on the left side of the face...</i>

652
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:16,471
<i>...the left side of the neck
at about the left upper thorax.</i>

653
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:19,791
<i>These extend from the lateral extent
of the left eye...</i>

654
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:22,639
<i>...and a portion of the left orbit
has been lacerated...</i>

655
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:25,712
<i>...and aqueous humor
protrudes from the laceration.</i>

656
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:28,839
There have been deep lacerations
in the immediate area.

657
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:32,117
And these have been approximated
by fine surgical sutures.

658
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:35,909
There are multiple surgical incisions
about the left side of the face.

659
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,514
There is considerable hemorrhage
in these deep tissues...

660
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:42,070
...and a number of surgical sutures
are present about this area.

661
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:45,078
There are entrances into the sinuses...

662
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:48,152
...and several pellets are found
located within this area.

663
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:52,119
There are also multiple lacerations
and multiple gunshot entrance wounds...

664
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:53,758
...about the left side of the neck.

665
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:57,719
And similar wounds are found
on the left upper thorax.

666
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:01,034
Would you send up
those prints right away?

667
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:08,037
There's a soft rubber catheter extending
out through the lateral extent of the...

668
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:21,878
I understand that Captain Bennet told you,
you had until Monday morning...

669
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:23,951
...to comply with
my writ of habeas corpus.

670
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:25,632
However, I want a signed admissión now...

671
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:28,359
...that Ross died
while he was in your custody.

672
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:31,077
When I'm ready. Yes?

673
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:33,077
Your photographs are coming through.

674
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:34,991
I'll be right up. Thank you.

675
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:37,640
I demand that signed statement. Now.

676
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:41,629
Excuse me.

677
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:07,473
Is that the girl?

678
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:09,636
Yeah.

679
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:17,476
Ross.

680
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,638
'"Albert Edward Renick. '"

681
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:21,991
'"Used car salesman. Chicago. '"

682
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,194
Who is Renick?

683
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:27,949
He was the man who was shot
in the Hotel Daniels.

684
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:30,793
You sent us to guard
the wrong man, Mr. Chalmers.

685
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:43,157
Mrs. Dorothy Renick and Mr. Al Renick...

686
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:45,435
...have reservations
on the seven o'clock flight to Rome.

687
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:47,317
Separate tickets. Not confirmed.

688
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:49,197
And I got this report from Chicago.

689
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:52,238
Renick has no record of arrests.
He's clean, Frank.

690
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:57,071
Ross took close to $2,000,000
from the Organization.

691
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:59,879
And he set Renick up
to get the heat off of him.

692
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:02,794
Then he killed Renick's wife to shut her up.

693
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,592
San Francisco Homicide.

694
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:51,190
Do you have a Mr. Renick
on the seven o'clock flight for Rome?

695
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:53,192
He confirmed his flight a half hour ago.

696
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:54,474
Did he check in yet?

697
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:57,711
Not here, but he could do that at the gate.
Shall I call Security?

698
01:29:57,800 --> 01:30:00,598
Call the gate.
Have them recheck all passports.

699
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:02,398
- Which gate?
- Seventy-three.

700
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:13,476
<i>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

701
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:16,199
<i>Clipper Flight 110 is now ready
for boarding.</i>

702
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:21,199
<i>We hope you have a pleasant flight
and thank you for choosing Pan American.</i>

703
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:23,715
<i>No smoking, please, beyond this point.</i>

704
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:27,156
<i>Would you please have
your passports available for inspection...</i>

705
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:29,708
<i>...as you pass through the departure gate?</i>

706
01:31:21,320 --> 01:31:22,389
Pardon me.

707
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:39,479
<i>And you're with the tour, too, are you?
There are other giris ahead of you.</i>

708
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:41,312
<i>Step right on through.</i>

709
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:30,994
Passenger Service.

710
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:32,399
Can I help you, sir?

711
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:36,712
Do you have a Renick, an Al E. Renick,
Flight 124 to London?

712
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:43,470
What?

713
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:48,869
Thank you. At the last minute,
on a Rome ticket. Flight Control.

714
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:30,714
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we have just
been instructed to return to the gate.</i>

715
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:32,597
<i>For your safety, please remain seated...</i>

716
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:35,274
<i>...until the aircraft has come
to a complete stop.</i>

717
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:37,430
<i>We anticipate only a short delay.</i>

718
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:40,558
<i>However, all passengers are requested
to disembark...</i>

719
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:43,393
<i>...and remain in the departure lounge.
Thank you.</i>

720
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:34,192
He's still my witness.

721
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:38,435
I'll be delighted to let you have him
after he testifies tomorrow.

722
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:55,553
The Organization.

723
01:34:56,640 --> 01:34:58,073
Several murders.

724
01:34:58,680 --> 01:35:00,830
Could do us both a great deal of good.

725
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:04,356
Look, Chalmers, let's understand
each other. I don't like you.

726
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:07,629
Come on now, don't be naive, Lieutenant.

727
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:10,190
We both know how careers are made.

728
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:13,195
Integrity is something
you sell to the public.

729
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:16,590
You sell whatever you want,
but don't sell it here tonight.

730
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:19,711
Frank, we must all compromise.

731
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:21,279
Bullshit!

732
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:26,876
Get the hell out of here. Now!

733
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:02,032
How long will we be delayed?

734
01:37:02,120 --> 01:37:03,951
Just about 45 minutes.

735
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:26,794
Won't be long.

736
01:39:57,840 --> 01:39:59,558
Get me the security guard!

737
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:31,148
Ticket, please.

738
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:55,511
All right. Get back. Get back.

739
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:32,160
<i>Wonder who he was? What he did?</i>

740
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:39,074
<i>I heard the shot all the way down the hall.</i>

741
01:46:39,200 --> 01:46:40,235
<i>He's a cop. That's what he is.</i>

742
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:43,710
<i>Let's get back. Let's get back.
Let's keep the area clear.</i>

743
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:47,634
<i>Now, ladies,
you don't want to see this now.</i>

744
01:48:30,720 --> 01:48:33,712
