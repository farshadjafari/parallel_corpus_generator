1
00:01:35,241 --> 00:01:39,007
Then I took it out to eat it.

2
00:01:41,447 --> 00:01:43,005
It was...

3
00:01:44,617 --> 00:01:46,084
this big.

4
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:52,780
Yellow, tasty looking sponge cake.

5
00:01:53,226 --> 00:01:55,490
I held it in my bosom all day.

6
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:02,294
Then I saw a girl carrying
her sister on her back.

7
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,604
Looked obvious
they were starving.

8
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:12,808
So pale, weak and helpless

9
00:02:14,147 --> 00:02:18,675
I turned away to eat it.

10
00:02:19,218 --> 00:02:22,984
But I ended up giving it to them.

11
00:02:24,524 --> 00:02:28,290
It must've been warm since

12
00:02:28,728 --> 00:02:31,993
I carried it around all day.

13
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:40,602
I didn't know if I'll ever
have cake like that again.

14
00:02:44,644 --> 00:02:49,513
She gobbled it down and shoved
some in her sisters mouth.

15
00:02:50,917 --> 00:02:54,507
Think God will remember that?

16
00:02:54,655 --> 00:02:56,485
Though its been 30 years?

17
00:02:59,225 --> 00:03:00,487
Absoposilutely.

18
00:03:01,127 --> 00:03:02,890
Remembering is His specialty.

19
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,090
Of course.

20
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:14,603
That song, Father Can you
play it for me, again?

21
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,095
You can do CPR, right?

22
00:03:42,635 --> 00:03:43,602
Go!

23
00:03:46,138 --> 00:03:47,105
Stop!

24
00:03:50,543 --> 00:03:51,510
Again!

25
00:04:03,623 --> 00:04:04,590
200 Joules.

26
00:04:17,036 --> 00:04:18,003
Charge.

27
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:27,433
Those who seek direct communication
with God are prone to self-hatred...

28
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:29,736
The Devil will eat right into you.

29
00:04:29,884 --> 00:04:33,182
As St. Bruno said, 'Suicide
is to die a martyr for Satan.'

30
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,189
It's worse than first degree murder.

31
00:04:37,823 --> 00:04:39,791
It's worth a life sentence...
in hell.

32
00:04:42,828 --> 00:04:45,118
20 Hail Mary's, get
lots of sun

33
00:04:45,266 --> 00:04:46,789
and take a cold shower.

34
00:04:47,033 --> 00:04:53,404
Get Gods help through science
and take some anti-depressants

35
00:04:55,641 --> 00:04:57,030
Stop thinking about
killing yourself.

36
00:04:57,178 --> 00:05:01,204
And... forget the
bastard who dumped you.

37
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:09,781
Father...

38
00:05:11,023 --> 00:05:14,083
I’ll deal with the bastards
and the worldly matters.

39
00:05:15,428 --> 00:05:17,589
You just stick to praying, Father.

40
00:05:18,831 --> 00:05:22,494
Ask the bishop to send
me to Emmanuel Labs, please?

41
00:05:24,036 --> 00:05:28,996
The Vatican does not
approve of that experiment.

42
00:05:30,543 --> 00:05:34,707
Sarah died on Monday
even after 8 surgeries.

43
00:05:35,247 --> 00:05:37,579
Hyo-sung went into
a coma yesterday.

44
00:05:39,118 --> 00:05:42,281
It kills me to watch them dying.

45
00:05:43,022 --> 00:05:48,187
No one knows what
really goes on at that lab.

46
00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:52,293
I want to save people.

47
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:58,124
I told you to go to med school
since you were in the crib,

48
00:05:58,272 --> 00:06:01,427
study ophthalmology,
and heal my eyes.

49
00:06:01,575 --> 00:06:04,130
But Father, I must go and...

50
00:06:04,278 --> 00:06:07,110
Enough! I'll just give you absolution.

51
00:06:10,816 --> 00:06:13,376
Stick to the confession!
Geeze!

52
00:06:17,022 --> 00:06:20,480
Dear patients, I regret not
seeing you before I left.

53
00:06:21,727 --> 00:06:24,389
I was busy preparing
for my sudden vacation.

54
00:06:26,332 --> 00:06:28,596
I packed a bunch of things.

55
00:06:29,435 --> 00:06:31,124
But they say to bring my body only.

56
00:06:31,272 --> 00:06:35,128
The monastery prepared a
luxurious hotel for me.

57
00:06:35,276 --> 00:06:38,108
Fr. Emmanuel Memorial Biochemical Labs
At times like this I'm glad I joined The Order.

58
00:06:42,248 --> 00:06:44,876
EV, namely Emmanuel Virus.

59
00:06:45,217 --> 00:06:48,584
When infected with it,
the symptoms are...

60
00:06:48,921 --> 00:06:52,011
First, blisters start
to form at the limbs,

61
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:55,315
then around the lips
eyelids, inside the nose,

62
00:06:55,463 --> 00:06:57,317
then spreads to the
middle of the body

63
00:06:57,465 --> 00:07:00,194
through the respiratory
and digestive tracts

64
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:05,293
The blisters cluster together
get bigger, and burst open.

65
00:07:05,638 --> 00:07:07,427
If the lesions form in the muscles,

66
00:07:07,575 --> 00:07:10,730
it can form big ulcers
and will hemorrhage.

67
00:07:10,878 --> 00:07:13,032
If it reaches the
internal organs,

68
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,134
the patient will start
coughing up a lot of blood,

69
00:07:15,282 --> 00:07:17,772
and eventually die
of excessive bleeding.

70
00:07:18,217 --> 00:07:19,684
There is no cure.

71
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:22,988
So if you were to get
infected during the experiment...

72
00:07:25,424 --> 00:07:26,982
all is lost.

73
00:07:29,028 --> 00:07:29,995
Now.

74
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,591
Instead of the usual answer.

75
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:37,498
What is your real purpose for
volunteering for this experiment?

76
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:42,628
On occasion, some people come
here thinking prayer is useless.

77
00:07:42,776 --> 00:07:45,904
And with the intent to
commit a 'dramatic suicide'.

78
00:07:46,545 --> 00:07:49,013
That is very discouraging for us.

79
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:52,178
By nature...

80
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:55,308
it's hard to distinguish
the state of mind of

81
00:07:55,456 --> 00:07:59,187
those who want
martyrdom or suicide.

82
00:07:59,825 --> 00:08:02,191
I expect you're not
someone like that are you?

83
00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:05,392
Are you sure about this?

84
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,394
My prayers work fine.

85
00:08:07,733 --> 00:08:11,294
Please look at
the camera and speak.

86
00:08:19,645 --> 00:08:22,235
Since Father Emmanuel
isolated the virus,

87
00:08:22,383 --> 00:08:26,005
there's not been one African
among the 600 victims.

88
00:08:26,153 --> 00:08:28,808
They've all been
Caucasians or Asians.

89
00:08:28,956 --> 00:08:32,311
And over 80% of them
have been missionaries,

90
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:34,187
namely single males.

91
00:08:34,727 --> 00:08:38,418
That's why the people here call
the disease the 'Curse of Bazira'.

92
00:08:38,566 --> 00:08:40,520
Bazira is the goddess
of widows.

93
00:08:40,668 --> 00:08:43,322
First, we administer the
vaccine we have developed,

94
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:46,302
then an inactive
EV inside the body.

95
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:49,702
Then we observe if the
vaccine functions properly.

96
00:08:51,243 --> 00:08:55,111
Grant me the following in the name
of our Lord Jesus Christ

97
00:08:56,348 --> 00:08:59,681
Like a leper rotting in flesh,
let all avoid me.

98
00:09:00,819 --> 00:09:05,085
Like a cripple without limbs,
let me not move freely.

99
00:09:07,126 --> 00:09:10,687
Remove my cheeks,
that tears may not roll down them.

100
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:15,691
Crush my lips and tongue,
that I may not sin with them.

101
00:09:16,035 --> 00:09:19,425
Pull out my nails
that I may grasp nothing.

102
00:09:19,573 --> 00:09:23,201
Let my shoulders and back be bent
that I may carry nothing.

103
00:09:25,744 --> 00:09:29,510
Like a man with tumor in the head
let me lack judgment.

104
00:09:31,016 --> 00:09:34,907
Ravage my body sworn to chastity
leave me with no pride,

105
00:09:35,055 --> 00:09:37,079
and have me live in shame.

106
00:09:38,324 --> 00:09:40,413
Let no one pray for me.

107
00:09:40,561 --> 00:09:44,895
But only the grace of the Lord
Jesus Christ have mercy on me.

108
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:55,700
A month has gone by already.

109
00:09:56,542 --> 00:10:01,411
Watching the grand view through
the window is more fun than TV.

110
00:10:03,248 --> 00:10:04,904
The hotel owner gave me
her best room,

111
00:10:05,052 --> 00:10:07,383
saying I'm handsome.

112
00:10:08,621 --> 00:10:12,284
Thanks to all the sunlight
my skin is tanned and peeling.

113
00:11:43,348 --> 00:11:46,181
Time of death, 3:31 p.m.

114
00:11:58,831 --> 00:12:00,119
Grant me the following

115
00:12:00,267 --> 00:12:03,099
in the name of
our Lord Jesus Christ.

116
00:12:04,236 --> 00:12:07,899
Like a leper rotting in flesh,
let all avoid me.

117
00:12:08,841 --> 00:12:09,929
Like a cripple without limbs...

118
00:12:10,077 --> 00:12:12,203
His skin...

119
00:12:14,146 --> 00:12:15,613
let me not move freely...

120
00:12:17,616 --> 00:12:19,481
6 months later

121
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,519
Touch my leg, Father!

122
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:36,522
Please pray for me, Father!

123
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,193
Please, Father?

124
00:12:39,037 --> 00:12:42,006
My daughter has leukemia!

125
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,286
I heard...

126
00:13:02,528 --> 00:13:07,295
people are coming to seek prayers
from The Bandaged Saint?

127
00:13:08,133 --> 00:13:10,499
Don't know how that
nonsense started.

128
00:13:15,941 --> 00:13:18,307
Though I did hear
of some people getting cured.

129
00:13:20,345 --> 00:13:22,905
Guess it can have
a psychological effect.

130
00:13:24,316 --> 00:13:28,082
After all, you're the only one
who survived out of 50 volunteers.

131
00:13:30,522 --> 00:13:31,489
Right?

132
00:13:34,326 --> 00:13:38,990
Wow! You're so lucky!

133
00:13:54,947 --> 00:13:58,280
Are you the miracle
survivor out of 500?

134
00:13:59,017 --> 00:14:02,180
My son has cancer!

135
00:14:03,222 --> 00:14:05,782
Please pray for him!

136
00:14:07,726 --> 00:14:11,787
It's just a psychological effect
There’s nothing I can do.

137
00:14:16,034 --> 00:14:17,423
Channel 9 won't come on, Mom.

138
00:14:17,571 --> 00:14:18,798
Let's pray kids.

139
00:14:24,843 --> 00:14:29,007
Did you ever live in Busan?

140
00:14:31,817 --> 00:14:36,083
We are gathered here
to pray for Kang-woo.

141
00:14:37,522 --> 00:14:39,990
Born under Your grace and love,

142
00:14:41,126 --> 00:14:44,391
embracing even
a wounded street dog...

143
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:47,998
he was a kind hearted boy.

144
00:14:48,734 --> 00:14:51,100
Remember his goodness
and have mercy on him.

145
00:14:52,037 --> 00:14:54,927
In Jesus' name we pray.

146
00:14:55,075 --> 00:14:56,007
- Amen.
- Amen.

147
00:14:58,443 --> 00:15:05,281
I don't believe in this
but since it's from an old friend...

148
00:15:10,322 --> 00:15:12,085
Now, I recognize you, son.

149
00:15:12,925 --> 00:15:14,688
Sorry. You're a Father, now.

150
00:15:17,329 --> 00:15:19,092
I’m sorry, Father.

151
00:15:22,434 --> 00:15:25,389
You used to come over
for noodles.

152
00:15:25,537 --> 00:15:29,803
Fifth grade, right?
You lived at the church orphanage?

153
00:15:31,243 --> 00:15:33,032
My son could never pass stray

154
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,808
cats and was so good
to the orphans.

155
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:40,378
Your sister was so shy and
ran out whenever I came over.

156
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:46,582
She had calluses on her feet
and Kang-woo made me touch them.

157
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:54,797
Her parents rented
a small room in our house.

158
00:15:56,435 --> 00:15:59,893
Her father was
a high school dropout.

159
00:16:00,439 --> 00:16:05,399
This is my bloodshed for
you so that sins may be forgiven.

160
00:16:05,644 --> 00:16:10,980
One day, they left her in my room
and said they'd be back soon.

161
00:16:11,717 --> 00:16:13,378
But they never came back!

162
00:16:14,419 --> 00:16:17,109
So I took the three-year-old

163
00:16:17,257 --> 00:16:20,191
in and raised her
like a daughter and puppy.

164
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,991
Happy Hanbok
Shed call me 'mommy'

165
00:16:23,428 --> 00:16:25,293
I'm her mommy-in-law, now.

166
00:16:28,834 --> 00:16:31,098
Marriage was no big deal.

167
00:16:31,636 --> 00:16:35,299
She just moved from sleeping
in my bed to Kang-woo's.

168
00:16:38,543 --> 00:16:43,310
Why'd you buy the laver
at that place again, Mom?

169
00:16:44,316 --> 00:16:51,882
I told you it's no good and
the owner's a cocksucker

170
00:17:23,221 --> 00:17:24,586
You hate Kimbap?

171
00:17:25,624 --> 00:17:29,082
No, I'm sensitive to smell
these days.

172
00:17:29,828 --> 00:17:32,490
I suddenly got a whiff of blood.

173
00:17:37,135 --> 00:17:38,500
Kang-woos home.

174
00:17:39,638 --> 00:17:41,627
- Mom, I caught a cold!
- What?

175
00:17:41,775 --> 00:17:43,028
Hi, Sang-hyun!

176
00:17:43,176 --> 00:17:45,130
I told you
to wear your long johns.

177
00:17:45,278 --> 00:17:48,110
- Were here, too
- Welcome.

178
00:17:49,247 --> 00:17:50,475
My friend the priest.

179
00:17:51,016 --> 00:17:53,605
This is our dam's
manager and his wife.

180
00:17:53,753 --> 00:17:57,109
It's an honor, Father
I'm Young-du

181
00:17:57,257 --> 00:18:00,012
She's a Filipina
so she's Catholic.

182
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,184
Say hello, Evelyn.

183
00:18:10,635 --> 00:18:14,503
- Tae-ju!
- How've you been?

184
00:18:20,745 --> 00:18:23,771
Here comes the Police Chief!

185
00:18:24,116 --> 00:18:29,179
Please, I quit
the force a long time ago.

186
00:18:30,622 --> 00:18:33,012
He's the dam's security
head This is Fr. Hyun, Sang-hyun

187
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,113
Hello.

188
00:18:34,261 --> 00:18:35,714
Do you like fishing Father?

189
00:18:35,862 --> 00:18:40,419
Get on his good side and you
can fish there though its banned.

190
00:18:40,567 --> 00:18:43,122
Daytimes a bit tricky.
Come by at nights.

191
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:46,295
- Have a seat, Father
- Let's get started.

192
00:18:50,942 --> 00:18:55,402
Koreans don't
appreciate Mahjong.

193
00:18:57,415 --> 00:19:00,506
Would you like to play, Father?

194
00:19:00,654 --> 00:19:03,588
- Sorry. I don't know how
- I see.

195
00:19:05,624 --> 00:19:09,492
Did I tell you about Father Hyun
praying for Kang-woo?

196
00:19:11,429 --> 00:19:14,887
I was standing right
next to my son.

197
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:20,225
Suddenly, I felt something hot
come down on my head.

198
00:19:20,373 --> 00:19:26,607
I felt tingly all over like
someone was poking me with needles.

199
00:19:29,848 --> 00:19:34,876
Then my boy said
'It feels hot right here, Mom.'

200
00:19:38,123 --> 00:19:40,489
Then the cancer vanished.

201
00:19:41,026 --> 00:19:42,288
It vanished?

202
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:47,398
You always feel tingly
cuz of your blood pressure.

203
00:19:47,632 --> 00:19:50,192
But I did a biopsy just in case.

204
00:19:52,637 --> 00:19:57,199
The endoscope showed
it was esophagus cancer.

205
00:19:57,842 --> 00:20:00,606
Women shouldn't
get sedated endoscopes.

206
00:20:01,046 --> 00:20:05,278
Doctors secretly rape them.

207
00:20:11,923 --> 00:20:13,083
I win!

208
00:20:14,426 --> 00:20:17,395
Three closed triplets!

209
00:20:17,829 --> 00:20:19,387
That's 8 points.

210
00:20:23,435 --> 00:20:27,303
Can we turn the heater down?

211
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:29,006
But I'm cold.

212
00:20:31,643 --> 00:20:32,905
Kang-woo says he's cold!

213
00:20:34,246 --> 00:20:37,374
Thank you very much.

214
00:21:04,342 --> 00:21:06,105
I'm losing so much.

215
00:21:06,845 --> 00:21:09,313
Instead of the hot water bag!

216
00:21:42,347 --> 00:21:44,281
I'm going down to get
the lights in the store.

217
00:22:56,621 --> 00:22:58,384
Don't you love our Mahjong gang?

218
00:23:03,428 --> 00:23:05,617
Wednesdays. Mercury. Water.

219
00:23:05,765 --> 00:23:08,290
Oasis! How's that
for our gang's name?

220
00:26:14,218 --> 00:26:16,482
She's a Catholic Veronica.

221
00:26:17,722 --> 00:26:19,690
She was in a bad hit-and-run.

222
00:26:21,826 --> 00:26:23,589
Lost a lot of blood.

223
00:26:24,028 --> 00:26:25,689
She doesn't have much time.

224
00:26:31,235 --> 00:26:33,225
Let this water call to mind
your baptismal sharing...

225
00:26:33,373 --> 00:26:37,502
in Christ's redeeming
passion and resurrection.

226
00:26:39,143 --> 00:26:42,306
Veronica. Make your confession.

227
00:27:03,935 --> 00:27:09,027
By the power the apostolic See
has given me in the name of the...

228
00:27:09,175 --> 00:27:10,929
Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit, I grant you

229
00:27:11,077 --> 00:27:12,100
a plenary indulgence and...

230
00:27:17,615 --> 00:27:19,504
pardon for all your sins.

231
00:27:19,652 --> 00:27:20,584
Amen.

232
00:27:24,522 --> 00:27:27,082
Through this holy anointing...

233
00:27:29,427 --> 00:27:31,588
may the Lord in his
love and mercy help you...

234
00:27:34,132 --> 00:27:37,397
with the grace of the Holy Spirit.

235
00:27:40,038 --> 00:27:41,096
And...

236
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,708
may the Lord who
frees you from sin...

237
00:27:45,643 --> 00:27:49,704
save you and raise you up.

238
00:27:51,816 --> 00:27:52,680
Amen.

239
00:31:28,332 --> 00:31:30,300
Where'd you wander
off to this time?

240
00:31:32,436 --> 00:31:35,326
I woke up I was at the pharmacy.

241
00:31:35,474 --> 00:31:37,498
And some man walked past.

242
00:31:38,442 --> 00:31:40,706
Aren't there pills
for sleepwalking?

243
00:31:42,046 --> 00:31:44,602
I should lock your room
from the outside.

244
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,478
Should've got me pills
for my cold.

245
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:49,377
Weren't you cold?

246
00:31:50,021 --> 00:31:51,682
You never catch a cold.

247
00:31:55,226 --> 00:31:56,784
She's a Yeti, Mom.

248
00:32:06,437 --> 00:32:08,405
Smells like
when you had gastritis.

249
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:10,704
I'll go find the pills.

250
00:32:13,744 --> 00:32:15,905
Must you do this to believe me?

251
00:32:19,917 --> 00:32:22,784
Don't grab my heart so hard.

252
00:32:39,537 --> 00:32:42,404
When I drank Hyo-sung's blood...

253
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,298
the blisters disappeared.

254
00:32:45,142 --> 00:32:47,508
It's as if the vampire cells
suppressed EV.

255
00:32:49,447 --> 00:32:51,381
But, it doesn't last very long.

256
00:32:53,617 --> 00:32:54,584
Father...

257
00:32:55,419 --> 00:32:58,183
I didn't choose the blood
that was transfused into me!

258
00:32:59,523 --> 00:33:01,787
You know I went
there to do good!

259
00:33:07,431 --> 00:33:10,195
Now, I thirst after
all sinful pleasures.

260
00:33:11,335 --> 00:33:15,101
But how can I get human
blood without killing!

261
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,707
First...

262
00:33:17,641 --> 00:33:20,610
The Lord said not to worry
about what to eat.

263
00:33:21,045 --> 00:33:23,206
For He feeds even
the birds in the sky.

264
00:33:23,814 --> 00:33:24,781
Here.

265
00:33:44,635 --> 00:33:45,693
I think I won.

266
00:33:46,937 --> 00:33:49,201
Small four winds!

267
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,104
Closed, half flush,
bonus 3 points!

268
00:33:53,444 --> 00:33:55,412
30 bucks! You lose!

269
00:33:58,516 --> 00:34:02,077
Some priest.
From Macao or something?

270
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:07,881
He's the only one
who survived out of 500.

271
00:34:08,125 --> 00:34:09,786
500, yeah right.

272
00:34:47,031 --> 00:34:48,396
When did you go out?

273
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:51,198
I didn't see you.

274
00:35:40,417 --> 00:35:44,183
It's ah...
kind of an infectious disease.

275
00:35:45,723 --> 00:35:46,690
Scary, isn't it?

276
00:35:47,625 --> 00:35:50,594
How different...
without his glasses.

277
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:54,991
How can you get infected?

278
00:35:57,334 --> 00:35:59,996
Not through a kiss for sure.

279
00:36:00,538 --> 00:36:03,302
I never kissed
anyone in my life.

280
00:36:07,845 --> 00:36:08,903
Until now.

281
00:36:37,841 --> 00:36:40,207
I don't get shy.

282
00:36:42,246 --> 00:36:44,271
I didn't run out cuz I'm shy.

283
00:36:45,616 --> 00:36:48,483
Back in Busan...

284
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,981
It's cuz I was
sick of everything.

285
00:36:57,328 --> 00:37:01,890
The mom, idiot son,
and the dark, damp house.

286
00:37:02,433 --> 00:37:05,095
The non-stop weepy, old songs.

287
00:37:12,243 --> 00:37:14,302
I waited for you to come.

288
00:37:15,346 --> 00:37:17,473
The orphanage boy...

289
00:37:19,817 --> 00:37:21,375
I waited for you...

290
00:37:22,419 --> 00:37:23,886
when I was young...

291
00:37:26,123 --> 00:37:28,091
cuz the idiot liked you.

292
00:37:29,226 --> 00:37:31,387
When you came,
he left me alone.

293
00:37:39,236 --> 00:37:41,602
I'm not a shy person.

294
00:37:55,419 --> 00:37:57,387
I run out on my bare feet...

295
00:37:58,322 --> 00:38:01,291
to escape from
this hell sooner.

296
00:38:10,834 --> 00:38:12,893
I even run out from my sleep.

297
00:38:13,337 --> 00:38:15,396
They think its sleepwalking.

298
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:20,003
I feel awake only then
and asleep the rest of the time.

299
00:39:43,026 --> 00:39:44,186
Honey!

300
00:39:45,929 --> 00:39:46,987
Tae-ju!

301
00:39:47,231 --> 00:39:48,289
Hot water bag!

302
00:39:49,533 --> 00:39:50,500
Tae-ju?

303
00:39:52,736 --> 00:39:53,998
Tae-ju!

304
00:40:27,337 --> 00:40:28,599
You bitch!

305
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:31,228
There she goes again.

306
00:40:31,376 --> 00:40:33,130
I fed you and raised you!

307
00:40:33,278 --> 00:40:36,007
Go put her to bed!

308
00:40:37,014 --> 00:40:39,778
You can't even change
your husband's hot water bag?

309
00:40:40,217 --> 00:40:43,380
How dare you!

310
00:40:43,821 --> 00:40:44,788
I win.

311
00:40:45,122 --> 00:40:46,089
Let go!

312
00:40:51,728 --> 00:40:55,319
Stomach troubles?
What took you so long?

313
00:40:55,467 --> 00:40:57,992
Eat up other's money
and you'll get diarrhea.

314
00:41:08,145 --> 00:41:09,112
What's got into you?

315
00:41:11,014 --> 00:41:12,572
This looks fun.

316
00:41:13,717 --> 00:41:15,685
So exciting to touch.

317
00:41:18,021 --> 00:41:19,810
I could do it all night, too.

318
00:41:19,958 --> 00:41:21,481
You don't even know
how to do it.

319
00:41:22,826 --> 00:41:23,884
Me?

320
00:41:25,028 --> 00:41:26,586
I know how to do it.

321
00:41:27,731 --> 00:41:28,891
I'm good.

322
00:41:31,335 --> 00:41:34,099
They are on fire!

323
00:41:35,138 --> 00:41:38,529
I can't wait till next Wednesday.

324
00:41:38,677 --> 00:41:40,906
Then how about Sundays, too?

325
00:41:42,246 --> 00:41:43,213
Why not?

326
00:41:44,515 --> 00:41:45,482
Well...

327
00:41:47,718 --> 00:41:50,482
It's Easter Sunday
I'm staying at the hospital.

328
00:41:51,522 --> 00:41:54,491
It's best to leave things
in wanting.

329
00:41:56,527 --> 00:41:57,494
Mom...

330
00:42:00,531 --> 00:42:01,498
I...

331
00:42:03,734 --> 00:42:06,396
can't live like this anymore.

332
00:42:07,838 --> 00:42:09,100
I...

333
00:42:11,141 --> 00:42:14,406
I want to help the needy.

334
00:42:18,315 --> 00:42:21,773
Maybe I can volunteer
at a hospital or something.

335
00:42:25,222 --> 00:42:26,280
On Sundays.

336
00:43:13,837 --> 00:43:15,395
Thank you for coming.

337
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,198
Don't come again.

338
00:43:19,443 --> 00:43:22,310
But I came to help the needy.

339
00:43:25,115 --> 00:43:28,380
It’s a bigger sin for a priest.

340
00:43:29,419 --> 00:43:31,683
I'm not Catholic.

341
00:43:33,023 --> 00:43:35,787
To me, you're just a needy,
single man.

342
00:43:36,627 --> 00:43:40,393
We can both go to hell for this.

343
00:43:41,131 --> 00:43:43,599
I don't have faith
I’m not going to hell.

344
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:50,199
But I...

345
00:43:53,343 --> 00:43:55,833
I have a terrible disease.

346
00:43:55,981 --> 00:43:58,471
I'm too damn healthy.

347
00:43:59,716 --> 00:44:02,480
Just once,
I wish I could be sick in bed.

348
00:44:29,546 --> 00:44:30,774
It's okay.

349
00:44:32,215 --> 00:44:36,379
Hyo-sung's in a coma.

350
00:44:37,821 --> 00:44:42,087
Unless his vitals drop
no one will come in here at nights.

351
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:29,392
Sorry, I hurt you.

352
00:46:32,936 --> 00:46:36,303
No, it’s good.

353
00:46:38,041 --> 00:46:39,702
It’s strange, but good.

354
00:46:43,446 --> 00:46:46,779
Is it supposed to
feel this good?

355
00:47:22,419 --> 00:47:23,886
What's wrong with me?

356
00:47:26,723 --> 00:47:28,691
Are other women like this?

357
00:47:31,228 --> 00:47:34,493
Am I a pervert?

358
00:51:13,316 --> 00:51:14,874
Did you eat?

359
00:51:15,618 --> 00:51:17,779
Ah, yes.

360
00:51:19,722 --> 00:51:22,384
Can we meet
during the day next week?

361
00:51:23,827 --> 00:51:25,385
Daytimes a bit...

362
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:28,898
We could be together longer.

363
00:51:32,535 --> 00:51:35,800
I don't want to keep my disease
a secret from you.

364
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,901
I am...

365
00:51:41,444 --> 00:51:44,675
a kind of a...

366
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:36,890
I don't kill anyone you know.

367
00:52:37,433 --> 00:52:39,094
Hyo-sung...

368
00:52:39,936 --> 00:52:42,803
He loved helping the hungry.

369
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:47,305
He'd offer me his blood,
if he wasn't in a coma.

370
00:52:48,545 --> 00:52:51,673
If you only heard
the sponge cake story.

371
00:52:52,815 --> 00:52:56,581
No one blames someone
for getting hurt in an accident!

372
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:00,182
No one gets criticized
for having cancer!

373
00:53:03,426 --> 00:53:05,792
I went there to do good!

374
00:53:14,537 --> 00:53:16,698
So what if I'm a vampire?

375
00:53:18,641 --> 00:53:21,906
Did you like me cuz I'm a priest?

376
00:53:22,645 --> 00:53:25,702
It’s not that, is it?
That's just my job.

377
00:53:25,850 --> 00:53:27,469
Being a vampire is
like having different palates...

378
00:53:27,617 --> 00:53:34,181
or different biorhythms
don't you think?

379
00:53:34,924 --> 00:53:38,087
When two people are in love,
does it really matter?

380
00:53:39,229 --> 00:53:40,787
No, what I mean is...

381
00:53:42,932 --> 00:53:44,593
You hate that I'm a vampire?

382
00:53:45,235 --> 00:53:48,325
Think I could've slept
with you if I wasn't?

383
00:53:48,473 --> 00:53:50,906
How could I have sex with you?

384
00:53:51,241 --> 00:53:52,902
As just a priest?

385
00:53:56,246 --> 00:53:57,365
Come with me.

386
00:53:57,513 --> 00:53:59,572
I'll take you away from this hell.

387
00:54:03,419 --> 00:54:06,479
You liked doing it with me
Kang-woo's no fun.

388
00:54:12,829 --> 00:54:13,887
Tae-ju?

389
00:54:22,238 --> 00:54:23,500
What's going on?

390
00:54:26,943 --> 00:54:28,604
The toilet's not flushing.

391
00:54:41,624 --> 00:54:43,182
It's going down now.

392
00:55:01,444 --> 00:55:02,502
Closing time.

393
00:55:53,229 --> 00:55:54,317
Hello?

394
00:55:54,465 --> 00:55:55,795
How can...

395
00:55:57,233 --> 00:55:59,098
someone become a vampire?

396
00:56:02,038 --> 00:56:04,506
Can you catch it through sex?

397
00:56:10,146 --> 00:56:12,580
Can you turn me into one?

398
00:56:54,524 --> 00:56:59,393
Vampires are...
cuter than I thought.

399
00:57:06,936 --> 00:57:08,301
Can you bend this?

400
00:57:09,439 --> 00:57:11,100
What for?

401
00:57:30,927 --> 00:57:32,292
Can you jump down from here?

402
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,003
Too high?

403
00:58:24,213 --> 00:58:25,475
I'm ready.

404
00:59:12,828 --> 00:59:14,193
Did Kang-woo do that?

405
00:59:16,532 --> 00:59:17,590
Does he hurt you often?

406
00:59:21,437 --> 00:59:23,098
Not often...

407
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:29,209
Want me to rip him up
like that coin?

408
00:59:41,123 --> 00:59:46,584
I lived as their dog
my whole life...

409
00:59:48,130 --> 00:59:53,591
feeding the idiot, washing him
and even helping him masturbate.

410
00:59:55,338 --> 00:59:56,703
You know...

411
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:00,404
I'm practically a virgin.

412
01:00:02,244 --> 01:00:03,108
He's...

413
01:00:04,714 --> 01:00:07,376
Does it hurt?

414
01:00:17,426 --> 01:00:21,192
Can't you volunteer
somewhere else?

415
01:00:22,131 --> 01:00:23,996
Mental hospitals are so scary.

416
01:00:32,942 --> 01:00:33,909
Drink it.

417
01:00:40,616 --> 01:00:43,278
Can't you go back to the lab?

418
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:48,580
Ask if there's any way
for a cure?

419
01:00:50,126 --> 01:00:53,289
Sunlight is bound to hit me
on my way there.

420
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:55,790
Sunlight...

421
01:00:57,633 --> 01:01:02,593
I wish I can see the sunrise
over the sea before I die.

422
01:01:05,041 --> 01:01:07,202
What are you thinking!

423
01:01:08,744 --> 01:01:10,871
Vampires can't see the sunlight!

424
01:01:12,014 --> 01:01:14,073
I don't care if it's at night.

425
01:01:15,217 --> 01:01:20,587
The moon, the stars
and even a firefly...

426
01:01:22,224 --> 01:01:23,978
Be the miracle worker!

427
01:01:24,126 --> 01:01:26,788
Make the blind see!

428
01:01:29,131 --> 01:01:30,996
Give me the vampire blood!

429
01:01:31,434 --> 01:01:34,096
It even killed EV!

430
01:01:34,537 --> 01:01:35,825
Please, Sang-hyun!

431
01:01:35,973 --> 01:01:38,702
Come here!

432
01:01:39,842 --> 01:01:42,902
Sang-hyun! Father Hyun!

433
01:01:43,813 --> 01:01:45,872
Please!

434
01:01:46,415 --> 01:01:48,576
Just a little bit, please?

435
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:54,387
I'm no longer
a priest nor a friar.

436
01:01:56,425 --> 01:01:59,292
Forget the rules!
Forget the Vatican!

437
01:02:00,229 --> 01:02:01,787
I'm leaving!

438
01:02:05,735 --> 01:02:08,397
Father Hyun! Father Hyun!

439
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:14,903
I don't know
why you wandered astray.

440
01:02:16,145 --> 01:02:20,172
But I know you'll get through this.

441
01:02:21,517 --> 01:02:25,977
I took pity on you
when you were young.

442
01:02:27,623 --> 01:02:30,490
We had you over for noodles.

443
01:02:32,428 --> 01:02:36,990
You can stay here
as long as you want.

444
01:02:37,733 --> 01:02:38,700
Thank you.

445
01:02:42,938 --> 01:02:44,803
Tae-ju...

446
01:02:46,642 --> 01:02:52,080
She's really good at heart.

447
01:02:53,516 --> 01:02:59,887
I'm giving the shop
and everything to her.

448
01:03:03,025 --> 01:03:05,186
Did I do it too hard?

449
01:03:10,533 --> 01:03:12,000
It's perfect.

450
01:03:16,539 --> 01:03:18,404
One more time, then?

451
01:03:46,435 --> 01:03:47,924
Good night.

452
01:03:48,072 --> 01:03:49,504
Sweet dreams.

453
01:05:08,317 --> 01:05:09,682
Get out! Go!

454
01:05:12,121 --> 01:05:13,588
Hurry!

455
01:05:14,823 --> 01:05:18,486
Go! Someone will see you!

456
01:05:27,436 --> 01:05:28,698
No! Don't!

457
01:05:48,223 --> 01:05:54,128
* The seagulls flying
in the distance...

458
01:05:54,430 --> 01:06:00,423
* I called, but no response.

459
01:06:00,571 --> 01:06:05,928
* O, my hometown by the waters
where bright blue stars glisten...

460
01:06:06,076 --> 01:06:12,276
* in my dreams full of sorrow.

461
01:06:14,817 --> 01:06:16,375
Remember Tae-ju
when she was young?

462
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:19,781
Wasn't she cute?

463
01:06:20,723 --> 01:06:22,912
When she was 12

464
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:25,892
she woke me up
and showed me her panties.

465
01:06:26,729 --> 01:06:27,991
Said she peed blood.

466
01:06:30,032 --> 01:06:33,900
Cuz mom worked her day
and night with needlework.

467
01:06:35,137 --> 01:06:37,503
We cried together all night.

468
01:06:40,843 --> 01:06:44,973
Planning on taking all night?

469
01:06:48,617 --> 01:06:49,879
It's only 9 o'clock.

470
01:06:50,619 --> 01:06:54,988
The hospital and police questioning
will take hours.

471
01:06:56,225 --> 01:06:58,284
What if the sun comes up?

472
01:07:12,841 --> 01:07:14,308
I said, no!

473
01:07:15,744 --> 01:07:17,268
Just a little bit?

474
01:07:19,114 --> 01:07:21,480
They'll find out with an autopsy!

475
01:07:23,919 --> 01:07:27,480
Why go somewhere else
for blood?

476
01:07:28,123 --> 01:07:29,988
We have blood right here.

477
01:07:32,227 --> 01:07:33,785
Put the knife down.

478
01:07:34,730 --> 01:07:36,197
Yeah, put it down.

479
01:07:40,936 --> 01:07:43,404
No! Don't come near me!

480
01:09:20,636 --> 01:09:25,198
One female. Unconscious.
Well be going soon.

481
01:09:42,624 --> 01:09:48,392
Don't mention
that I let you fish here.

482
01:09:49,331 --> 01:09:52,095
I'll take care of everything.

483
01:10:15,023 --> 01:10:18,114
Father Hyun... Father...

484
01:10:18,262 --> 01:10:21,390
He became ill again for our sins!

485
01:10:24,132 --> 01:10:26,922
Grant me the following

486
01:10:27,070 --> 01:10:30,095
in the name of
our Lord Jesus Christ.

487
01:10:30,639 --> 01:10:35,303
Like a leper rotting in flesh,
let all avoid me.

488
01:10:35,844 --> 01:10:38,901
Like a cripple without limbs

489
01:10:39,049 --> 01:10:41,778
let me not move freely.

490
01:10:42,417 --> 01:10:44,206
Remove my cheeks

491
01:10:44,354 --> 01:10:47,288
that tears may
not roll down them.

492
01:10:49,625 --> 01:10:51,786
There was a house
at the bottom of the lake.

493
01:10:52,227 --> 01:10:53,785
A submerged village.

494
01:10:55,030 --> 01:10:58,193
I thought he was dead.

495
01:10:58,834 --> 01:11:02,702
But when I went up
he'd float up, too.

496
01:11:03,438 --> 01:11:05,227
So I put him in a closet
in the house

497
01:11:05,375 --> 01:11:08,002
and a big rock on his chest.

498
01:11:10,145 --> 01:11:12,670
What if he comes out
and chases me?

499
01:11:14,616 --> 01:11:18,074
I should've put a rock
at the closet door, too.

500
01:11:19,321 --> 01:11:21,687
Death is the end. Right Father?

501
01:11:22,924 --> 01:11:23,891
When you're dead, you're dead?

502
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:39,607
See?

503
01:11:41,943 --> 01:11:44,468
Vampires are not immortal.

504
01:11:46,315 --> 01:11:47,873
You still want my blood?

505
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:55,279
You want to see
this dark world that badly?

506
01:11:57,526 --> 01:11:59,790
You live on other's blood

507
01:12:00,529 --> 01:12:02,588
but won't give me
a drop of yours!

508
01:12:08,637 --> 01:12:11,105
Give me absolution and
I'll give it to you.

509
01:12:19,014 --> 01:12:21,380
God the Father of mercies,
has reconciled the world to himself

510
01:12:22,117 --> 01:12:25,678
through the death
and resurrection of his Son...

511
01:12:26,221 --> 01:12:29,679
and sent the Holy Spirit among us
for the forgiveness of sins;

512
01:12:30,425 --> 01:12:32,014
through the ministry of the Church

513
01:12:32,162 --> 01:12:34,186
may God give you
pardon and peace...

514
01:12:34,730 --> 01:12:38,320
and I absolve you from your sins
in the name of the Father...

515
01:12:38,468 --> 01:12:40,322
and of the Son
and of the Holy Spirit.

516
01:12:40,470 --> 01:12:41,402
Amen.

517
01:12:42,337 --> 01:12:44,805
Let us praise the Lord.

518
01:12:49,444 --> 01:12:52,675
The Lord's mercy endures forever.

519
01:12:55,217 --> 01:12:59,381
The Lord has forgiven your sins.

520
01:14:02,217 --> 01:14:03,980
Go home and rest.

521
01:14:06,321 --> 01:14:08,585
You must be tired.

522
01:14:11,726 --> 01:14:13,785
She's my only friend.

523
01:14:14,629 --> 01:14:17,792
I know she’ll get better
if you pray for her.

524
01:14:24,539 --> 01:14:26,006
Please.

525
01:14:29,144 --> 01:14:32,170
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

526
01:14:33,114 --> 01:14:34,081
Amen.

527
01:14:37,919 --> 01:14:40,786
I pray to Tae-ju.

528
01:14:41,523 --> 01:14:44,583
Please wake up
and listen to my prayer.

529
01:14:47,128 --> 01:14:50,819
I said Kang-woo was drunk
from a bottle of So-ju.

530
01:14:50,967 --> 01:14:53,992
So say the same to the cops.

531
01:14:54,936 --> 01:14:57,826
When this is all over
we will be together.

532
01:14:57,974 --> 01:15:00,806
We must not meet for a while.

533
01:15:03,044 --> 01:15:07,202
Though my face may seem
cold and rigid...

534
01:15:07,350 --> 01:15:09,476
my heart only beats for you.

535
01:15:10,819 --> 01:15:15,984
When we meet again
I believe we'll finally be happy.

536
01:15:18,426 --> 01:15:19,393
Father?

537
01:15:20,328 --> 01:15:21,989
Doing it this way...

538
01:15:22,531 --> 01:15:26,592
feels like III live on inside you.

539
01:16:11,713 --> 01:16:12,601
Stop all the...

540
01:16:12,749 --> 01:16:13,976
thinking, longing.

541
01:16:14,916 --> 01:16:20,582
The police needs the body
to close the case.

542
01:16:22,724 --> 01:16:30,187
Kang-woo couldn't swim, Mrs. Ra
You gotta move on with your life.

543
01:16:31,333 --> 01:16:32,698
Kang-woo can swim.

544
01:16:40,542 --> 01:16:42,908
Father Hyun's still not
taking calls?

545
01:16:43,545 --> 01:16:45,172
It must've been a big shock.

546
01:16:49,217 --> 01:16:51,583
Still, he could've come
to the funeral.

547
01:16:58,627 --> 01:16:59,594
Kang-woo!

548
01:17:00,829 --> 01:17:01,796
Kang-woo!

549
01:17:06,434 --> 01:17:08,223
I'm Sang-hyun, Ma'am.

550
01:17:08,371 --> 01:17:09,803
I know I'm all wet but...

551
01:17:10,238 --> 01:17:11,398
My poor baby.

552
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:13,829
What took you so long?

553
01:17:13,977 --> 01:17:15,705
Why didn't you call?

554
01:17:16,845 --> 01:17:20,076
Bastard! You son of a bitch!

555
01:17:22,717 --> 01:17:24,406
- Mrs. Ra!
- Mrs. Ra!

556
01:17:24,554 --> 01:17:26,077
Wake up Mrs. Ra!

557
01:17:28,523 --> 01:17:31,788
Drink this, Mrs. Ra!

558
01:17:35,930 --> 01:17:39,798
This is why we should all watch
our blood pressures.

559
01:17:40,835 --> 01:17:42,200
Watch our drinking.

560
01:17:42,737 --> 01:17:44,705
And stay away from salty foods.

561
01:17:47,342 --> 01:17:54,180
Let's give Mrs. Ra
our positive energy, Oasis-style.

562
01:17:54,716 --> 01:17:57,276
Starting with Tae-ju.

563
01:17:59,821 --> 01:18:00,981
Mom...

564
01:18:01,923 --> 01:18:05,188
How long's it been?

565
01:18:47,936 --> 01:18:49,403
Why are you so wet?

566
01:18:49,838 --> 01:18:50,805
What?

567
01:18:54,442 --> 01:18:55,500
Is there a leak?

568
01:18:58,613 --> 01:18:59,978
Whys it so damp?

569
01:19:05,420 --> 01:19:07,888
Come here and
stop imagining things.

570
01:19:14,729 --> 01:19:17,197
It's all psychological.

571
01:19:19,434 --> 01:19:21,800
Stop making a fuss
and will you come here?

572
01:20:17,926 --> 01:20:19,393
Was he here, too?

573
01:20:24,632 --> 01:20:25,599
He? Who?

574
01:20:28,436 --> 01:20:33,806
* Seagulls flying
in the distance...

575
01:21:44,712 --> 01:21:45,770
Don't fall for it.

576
01:21:46,514 --> 01:21:48,072
It's all just an illusion.

577
01:21:48,516 --> 01:21:51,781
It's just psychological.

578
01:22:51,312 --> 01:22:52,370
You're going?

579
01:22:56,417 --> 01:22:59,875
How can someone do it
five times, straight?

580
01:23:53,641 --> 01:23:57,372
Mom never once
threw me a birthday party.

581
01:24:06,220 --> 01:24:07,278
How dare you!

582
01:24:25,239 --> 01:24:29,608
But she always gave me
plenty to eat.

583
01:24:31,312 --> 01:24:32,370
Then thank her.

584
01:24:35,316 --> 01:24:36,283
Thank you.

585
01:24:41,722 --> 01:24:46,014
Can't you go to that detective?

586
01:24:46,162 --> 01:24:47,685
Aren't you thirsty these days?

587
01:24:53,034 --> 01:24:55,298
I'll throw you
a birthday party this year.

588
01:24:58,539 --> 01:24:59,728
Really?

589
01:24:59,876 --> 01:25:01,900
The first birthday party
in my life?

590
01:25:03,544 --> 01:25:08,277
But... I don't know
when my birthday is.

591
01:25:22,730 --> 01:25:24,789
But who made you boss?

592
01:25:25,933 --> 01:25:27,122
Telling me this and that

593
01:25:27,270 --> 01:25:28,395
and hitting me around.

594
01:25:29,937 --> 01:25:32,906
Kang-woo never laid
a hand on me.

595
01:26:19,420 --> 01:26:20,580
Did Kang-woo...

596
01:26:21,622 --> 01:26:23,180
beat you or not?

597
01:26:24,926 --> 01:26:26,587
Why does that matter?

598
01:26:28,729 --> 01:26:30,287
That's why he died!

599
01:26:31,332 --> 01:26:32,799
Don't make excuses!

600
01:26:33,834 --> 01:26:35,893
You would've killed him anyway.

601
01:26:36,437 --> 01:26:40,028
So you can have me for yourself.

602
01:26:40,176 --> 01:26:43,975
Do you know how hard
I tried not to kill people?

603
01:26:46,914 --> 01:26:48,973
You can't even begin to imagine!

604
01:26:51,319 --> 01:26:54,482
A blood thirsty beast
is growling inside me!

605
01:26:55,523 --> 01:26:58,583
But I tiptoed around
afraid to hurt anyone.

606
01:27:01,729 --> 01:27:03,390
I killed him cuz of you.

607
01:27:06,334 --> 01:27:07,301
To save you.

608
01:27:10,838 --> 01:27:12,703
To save me?

609
01:27:16,043 --> 01:27:18,170
Then why am I living
a nightmare?

610
01:27:20,114 --> 01:27:23,805
I stay up trembling
at the thought of

611
01:27:23,953 --> 01:27:27,183
your cold hand touching me.

612
01:27:27,822 --> 01:27:29,084
How did this happen?

613
01:27:36,931 --> 01:27:38,091
Mom!

614
01:27:41,035 --> 01:27:41,899
Mom!

615
01:27:43,137 --> 01:27:44,826
I'm done for.

616
01:27:44,974 --> 01:27:46,804
He's going to kill me.

617
01:27:47,541 --> 01:27:49,304
Poor Kang-woo...

618
01:27:50,044 --> 01:27:53,172
My poor, dear mom...

619
01:27:54,215 --> 01:27:58,379
You treated that devil like a son
and this is what you get?

620
01:28:00,221 --> 01:28:01,688
Did I do it alone?

621
01:28:02,923 --> 01:28:04,481
It was your idea.

622
01:28:10,731 --> 01:28:13,521
No! It was his idea!

623
01:28:13,669 --> 01:28:15,602
He said he'll kill
the mother and son!

624
01:28:17,038 --> 01:28:18,300
Honest!

625
01:28:51,439 --> 01:28:54,704
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

626
01:28:56,644 --> 01:28:59,875
We were a happy family of three
till you infested us!

627
01:29:00,214 --> 01:29:01,476
You're a germ!

628
01:29:07,321 --> 01:29:10,290
You said I was cute, you cunt!

629
01:29:23,037 --> 01:29:25,198
Mommy, mommy...

630
01:29:26,140 --> 01:29:27,698
Look at me.

631
01:29:29,043 --> 01:29:31,068
You can't die like this.

632
01:29:32,513 --> 01:29:33,480
Mom.

633
01:29:37,218 --> 01:29:40,085
Tell me you forgive me.

634
01:29:40,721 --> 01:29:41,779
Mom...

635
01:29:42,223 --> 01:29:43,588
Look at me.

636
01:29:43,924 --> 01:29:48,116
If you forgive me blink once.

637
01:29:48,264 --> 01:29:50,993
Just one blink? Please?

638
01:29:54,235 --> 01:29:57,204
Just once? Please?

639
01:30:06,914 --> 01:30:07,881
Let's go!

640
01:30:08,215 --> 01:30:11,275
That devil will suck
all the blood out of you, too!

641
01:30:16,223 --> 01:30:17,190
Let go!

642
01:30:19,627 --> 01:30:20,491
Let go!

643
01:30:27,535 --> 01:30:30,095
Stay back you devil!

644
01:30:39,213 --> 01:30:40,771
I want to go to Kang-woo.

645
01:30:41,515 --> 01:30:42,880
Kill me, please.

646
01:30:43,417 --> 01:30:44,782
You want to go?

647
01:30:47,922 --> 01:30:49,685
Go to your husband?

648
01:30:56,230 --> 01:30:56,992
Really?

649
01:35:39,913 --> 01:35:42,177
Happy birthday, Tae-ju.

650
01:35:47,921 --> 01:35:52,187
Completely white
just like daylight.

651
01:36:59,226 --> 01:37:03,492
That's a good girl.

652
01:37:04,131 --> 01:37:10,324
From now on, we wear shoes
inside the house like in the States.

653
01:37:10,472 --> 01:37:12,405
Cuz I'm in charge, now.

654
01:37:13,941 --> 01:37:17,570
You have to
sleep during the day, too.

655
01:37:18,312 --> 01:37:19,677
And eat at night...

656
01:37:22,316 --> 01:37:23,283
Did you just move?

657
01:37:31,925 --> 01:37:34,189
Watch TV while I'm out.

658
01:37:38,131 --> 01:37:40,292
A scary movies gonna be on.

659
01:39:51,932 --> 01:39:53,695
I'm not ashamed at all!

660
01:39:55,135 --> 01:39:56,102
I told you!

661
01:39:56,737 --> 01:39:57,704
III get the blood!

662
01:39:58,438 --> 01:39:59,927
Stealing from the hospital?

663
01:40:00,075 --> 01:40:01,729
- There's more.
- What?

664
01:40:01,877 --> 01:40:03,998
I'm helping people
who want to commit suicide.

665
01:40:04,146 --> 01:40:06,978
I know many people like that
from listening to confessions.

666
01:40:07,614 --> 01:40:10,777
If I run out, I'll find more
through the Internet.

667
01:40:11,918 --> 01:40:17,788
They face death more peacefully
if I help them.

668
01:40:22,629 --> 01:40:24,790
If they just give it to you,
what fun is that?

669
01:40:34,441 --> 01:40:36,102
It tastes much better this way.

670
01:40:37,010 --> 01:40:39,069
How many has to die
for your taste?

671
01:40:39,913 --> 01:40:45,374
Maybe around 500?
How's that, Father?

672
01:40:46,019 --> 01:40:47,884
I told you
I'm not a Father anymore!

673
01:40:48,522 --> 01:40:52,185
Oh dear, the Father is mad.

674
01:40:53,326 --> 01:40:56,989
Stop acting so humane!
You're not even human.

675
01:40:59,032 --> 01:41:00,120
Then what are we?

676
01:41:00,268 --> 01:41:02,497
We're human-eating beasts
that's what!

677
01:41:09,743 --> 01:41:11,768
Is it a sin for a fox
to eat a chicken?

678
01:41:37,437 --> 01:41:39,598
Don't make me regret
saving you.

679
01:41:41,041 --> 01:41:45,671
Kill me or save me
you'll regret either way.

680
01:41:46,213 --> 01:41:47,680
We're through!

681
01:41:59,126 --> 01:42:04,792
I dump him
and he drops me like this?

682
01:42:14,241 --> 01:42:16,607
You're the only one
I've got, now.

683
01:43:29,216 --> 01:43:32,777
You said women are
safe from EV.

684
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:37,980
Your blood is completely
mixed with mine.

685
01:43:40,927 --> 01:43:42,986
Then, I'm no longer
a woman?

686
01:43:54,241 --> 01:43:55,401
Hold on.

687
01:44:00,213 --> 01:44:01,475
I'll get a doctor.

688
01:44:39,019 --> 01:44:40,179
Hello?

689
01:44:43,423 --> 01:44:44,788
How do you feel...

690
01:45:13,820 --> 01:45:14,684
Tae-ju...

691
01:45:16,923 --> 01:45:18,584
What day is it today?

692
01:45:27,934 --> 01:45:30,824
The eyes are so telling.

693
01:45:30,972 --> 01:45:35,429
They can express everything
between yes and no.

694
01:45:35,577 --> 01:45:38,670
What good is just a yes or no?

695
01:45:39,612 --> 01:45:42,877
You need a subject and verb
to communicate.

696
01:45:45,418 --> 01:45:49,582
The subject is
what's being stared at.

697
01:45:50,323 --> 01:45:53,190
If you stare at something
for over 4 seconds...

698
01:45:53,526 --> 01:45:57,292
others will automatically
turn to look, too.

699
01:45:58,131 --> 01:45:59,496
Is that a published theory?

700
01:46:01,935 --> 01:46:03,300
Haven't had the chance yet.

701
01:46:05,438 --> 01:46:09,306
I'm an expert at reading the eyes
after 2 years of marriage

702
01:46:10,510 --> 01:46:11,999
That's why her Korean's
not improving.

703
01:46:12,147 --> 01:46:14,979
Can you tell
what mom's saying?

704
01:46:15,315 --> 01:46:16,577
That's what I'm talking about!

705
01:46:17,117 --> 01:46:20,780
Tae-ju just saw me
peek over at Mrs. Ra.

706
01:46:21,521 --> 01:46:25,685
She knew what I was going to say,
before I said it.

707
01:46:26,226 --> 01:46:27,887
By glancing at my eyes.

708
01:46:30,330 --> 01:46:35,722
Mrs. Ra said I'd win
if I took this piece.

709
01:46:35,870 --> 01:46:38,725
And that she wants
some Vodka.

710
01:46:38,873 --> 01:46:39,896
Vodka!

711
01:46:42,542 --> 01:46:44,066
I win!

712
01:46:44,411 --> 01:46:46,400
Closed, Self-draw,
bonus 3 points,

713
01:46:46,548 --> 01:46:47,571
Big three dragons!

714
01:46:49,015 --> 01:46:50,983
See that?

715
01:46:52,318 --> 01:46:55,185
Thank you, Mrs. Ra.

716
01:46:57,724 --> 01:46:59,692
You want to play that bad?

717
01:47:01,728 --> 01:47:05,186
How about teaming her up
with Evelyn?

718
01:47:06,232 --> 01:47:10,498
If you blink it means 'yes'.

719
01:47:11,137 --> 01:47:14,197
A long blink means 'no'.

720
01:47:14,841 --> 01:47:16,029
Okay?

721
01:47:16,177 --> 01:47:19,270
Blink if you understand.

722
01:47:30,723 --> 01:47:31,985
Throw it away.

723
01:47:32,625 --> 01:47:34,286
Mrs. Ra is back!

724
01:47:34,828 --> 01:47:37,296
Evelyn? Vodka.

725
01:47:54,614 --> 01:47:55,672
'D'.

726
01:47:56,316 --> 01:47:59,683
'D', what?

727
01:48:00,420 --> 01:48:02,388
You can move
your finger, mom?

728
01:48:03,423 --> 01:48:04,981
What's wrong with your nail?

729
01:48:05,925 --> 01:48:11,886
'L' It's another letter!

730
01:48:12,632 --> 01:48:13,496
What?

731
01:48:13,733 --> 01:48:17,294
'L, D'.

732
01:48:18,037 --> 01:48:19,226
Or 'D, L'?

733
01:48:19,374 --> 01:48:22,028
'D' comes last, 'LD'.

734
01:48:22,176 --> 01:48:23,972
Maybe she wants the 'LCD' on?

735
01:48:24,310 --> 01:48:26,600
There's probably
a 'C' somewhere.

736
01:48:26,748 --> 01:48:29,181
'C'...

737
01:48:46,132 --> 01:48:47,099
Found it!

738
01:48:53,039 --> 01:48:55,007
- 'K'!
- 'K'?

739
01:48:56,543 --> 01:48:57,976
L. D. K?

740
01:49:06,619 --> 01:49:10,385
Ladies Delaying,
Killing the game.

741
01:49:11,925 --> 01:49:14,514
'D' comes last! 'KLD'!

742
01:49:14,662 --> 01:49:16,686
Mrs. Ra, it's 'DKL', right?

743
01:49:20,433 --> 01:49:22,322
She says, no.

744
01:49:22,470 --> 01:49:26,496
'KLD'? 'KILLED'?

745
01:49:28,141 --> 01:49:29,199
I'm right?

746
01:49:31,210 --> 01:49:34,373
See? It's 'KILLED'!

747
01:49:36,416 --> 01:49:38,281
Whatever, let's keep
the game alive.

748
01:49:39,719 --> 01:49:44,486
- Whose turn is it?
- Killed who?

749
01:50:00,039 --> 01:50:02,701
Mahjong brings back
memories of Kang-woo?

750
01:50:03,910 --> 01:50:06,970
Mom... it's not your fault.

751
01:50:07,413 --> 01:50:09,381
He didn't die cuz of you.

752
01:50:09,816 --> 01:50:11,977
Stop playing and go to bed.

753
01:50:14,621 --> 01:50:16,282
Tae-ju's so strong.

754
01:50:24,731 --> 01:50:27,721
Stop torturing yourself

755
01:50:27,869 --> 01:50:29,699
Look at me, Mrs. Ra.

756
01:50:30,136 --> 01:50:32,325
It was an accident.

757
01:50:32,473 --> 01:50:34,497
No one killed Kang-woo.

758
01:51:06,939 --> 01:51:10,375
It's not like Tae-ju
and Sang-hyun killed...

759
01:52:32,925 --> 01:52:35,086
Selfish humans.

760
01:52:37,029 --> 01:52:42,490
Bastards coming to play Mahjong
with a grieving family

761
01:52:48,141 --> 01:52:49,108
What?

762
01:52:50,710 --> 01:52:53,178
Why you little shit.

763
01:52:56,415 --> 01:53:01,978
I'm leaving,
cuz shit smells not scares.

764
01:53:25,711 --> 01:53:28,680
Honey! No!

765
01:53:41,527 --> 01:53:43,085
Oh, Young-du.

766
01:53:43,930 --> 01:53:45,295
Young-du!

767
01:54:11,123 --> 01:54:12,090
Stop it.

768
01:54:59,138 --> 01:55:02,505
You easy-blood drinking coward.

769
01:55:44,317 --> 01:55:47,878
It's cuz he's dead
and the heart stopped pumping.

770
01:55:50,923 --> 01:55:52,982
Cut off the ankles and...

771
01:55:53,626 --> 01:55:59,997
hang them over the bathtub
and let gravity do the rest.

772
01:56:01,634 --> 01:56:05,092
We can put the blood in Tupperware
and keep it in the fridge

773
01:56:07,139 --> 01:56:11,576
I thought of using a motor pump
but this works best.

774
01:56:12,712 --> 01:56:15,272
Sucking a little
and throwing the body away is

775
01:56:18,217 --> 01:56:20,082
treating life too lightly, isn't it?

776
01:56:39,338 --> 01:56:40,396
Evelyn...

777
01:56:43,542 --> 01:56:49,174
How could I have made
all those Kimbaps without you?

778
01:56:50,316 --> 01:56:51,977
It's over now.

779
01:56:53,819 --> 01:56:55,081
Happy?

780
01:57:08,634 --> 01:57:09,923
Tae-ju.

781
01:57:10,071 --> 01:57:12,300
Listen to me carefully.

782
01:57:15,641 --> 01:57:17,165
Why do I have to run away?

783
01:57:21,614 --> 01:57:22,767
From my own house?

784
01:57:22,915 --> 01:57:26,783
Wont they search the house
when they find the 4 people missing?

785
01:57:34,727 --> 01:57:39,684
They'll come in here
without dusting off their shoes?

786
01:57:39,832 --> 01:57:45,124
Search the house, open the cabinet
and open the curtains...

787
01:57:45,272 --> 01:57:47,797
Then we'll die?

788
01:57:52,011 --> 01:57:53,672
What are you doing?

789
01:57:59,118 --> 01:58:01,279
You already had your fill.

790
01:58:37,623 --> 01:58:38,988
Where are we going?

791
01:58:49,535 --> 01:58:50,900
Where are you going?

792
01:58:52,338 --> 01:58:53,703
The sun's coming up!

793
02:00:28,934 --> 02:00:31,300
Didn't you have your fill
from Evelyn?

794
02:07:10,736 --> 02:07:14,103
I wanted to live
with you forever and ever.

795
02:07:17,909 --> 02:07:19,672
Together again in hell then.

796
02:07:23,615 --> 02:07:26,880
When you're dead, you're dead.

797
02:07:29,521 --> 02:07:32,979
It's been fun, Father.
