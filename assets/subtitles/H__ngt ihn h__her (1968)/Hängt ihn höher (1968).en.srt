00:24:48,669 --> 00:24:50,253
That bastard!

179
00:24:54,884 --> 00:24:56,426
(THUDDING)

180
00:24:56,927 --> 00:24:58,928
PRISONER: No!

181
00:25:00,473 --> 00:25:04,976
What kind of justice hangs a man
before he's heard about his appeal?

182
00:25:08,481 --> 00:25:10,065
PRISONER: No!

183
00:25:20,993 --> 00:25:21,993
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

184
00:25:22,203 --> 00:25:23,495
Come in.

185
00:25:35,549 --> 00:25:38,301
Leave him.
Without shackles.

186
00:25:39,428 --> 00:25:40,845
Yes, sir.

187
00:25:56,112 --> 00:25:57,612
All right, guard.

188
00:26:10,709 --> 00:26:13,628
Your story checks out, Cooper.
You're free to go.

189
00:26:21,053 --> 00:26:22,303
$11?

190
00:26:22,388 --> 00:26:25,974
And 40 cents. That's all McCleod
had on him when we picked him up.

191
00:26:27,184 --> 00:26:28,810
McCleod?

192
00:26:28,894 --> 00:26:30,937
McCleod was running from the law,

193
00:26:31,814 --> 00:26:34,983
holed up at Johanson's place,
killed that old man and his wife,

194
00:26:35,067 --> 00:26:37,360
and then you blundered in.

195
00:26:37,444 --> 00:26:41,156
A stranger looking to buy some cattle,
so McCleod sold you a few head.

196
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,867
He must've got a pretty
good laugh out of that.

197
00:26:43,951 --> 00:26:45,743
You wanna see what he looks like?

198
00:26:46,662 --> 00:26:49,414
Come on.
Now, come on.

199
00:27:11,312 --> 00:27:13,271
McCleod took the money
he swindled from you

200
00:27:13,355 --> 00:27:15,773
and came into town,
looking for a good time.

201
00:27:15,858 --> 00:27:18,193
The row, that's where we found him.

202
00:27:44,803 --> 00:27:46,304
(PEOPLE EXCLAIMING)

203
00:27:56,357 --> 00:27:59,025
May God have mercy on his soul.

204
00:28:00,653 --> 00:28:02,528
You're free to go, Cooper.

205
00:28:06,075 --> 00:28:08,534
With my $11.40?

206
00:28:08,619 --> 00:28:11,913
And the satisfaction of seeing the man
that got you into this mess hung.

207
00:28:11,997 --> 00:28:15,500
What about the nine
just men who hung me?

208
00:28:16,001 --> 00:28:18,670
Just give their description to
one of the deputies downstairs.

209
00:28:18,754 --> 00:28:19,754
They'll try to pick them up.

210
00:28:19,838 --> 00:28:21,798
Well, that's not good enough.

211
00:28:22,716 --> 00:28:27,762
Cooper, you take the law into
your own hands, and I promise you

212
00:28:27,846 --> 00:28:30,974
you'll swing from one of
those ropes out there.

213
00:28:31,058 --> 00:28:34,185
I know a little bit about
the law, Your Honor!

214
00:28:36,563 --> 00:28:37,814
That's right.

215
00:28:38,524 --> 00:28:39,941
You do.

216
00:28:42,695 --> 00:28:44,445
Sit down, Cooper.

217
00:28:47,032 --> 00:28:48,032
Please.

218
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:02,672
You were a lawman in Saint Louis,

219
00:29:03,382 --> 00:29:05,383
a damn good one.

220
00:29:06,635 --> 00:29:09,137
I can use a good man, Cooper.

221
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:12,348
Pay, 250 a month.

222
00:29:12,433 --> 00:29:15,518
That's 230 more than
you'd make as a cowhand,

223
00:29:15,602 --> 00:29:18,980
232 more than as an army sergeant.
Here.

224
00:29:19,064 --> 00:29:22,859
That hanging rope didn't kill ya.
Maybe my coffee will.

225
00:29:22,943 --> 00:29:24,652
How much did you make in Saint Louis?

226
00:29:25,821 --> 00:29:29,157
It's 200 more than I
made in Saint Louis.

227
00:29:29,241 --> 00:29:31,659
250, plus expenses.

228
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:37,582
I warn you, the pay is a
little slow in coming.

229
00:29:39,084 --> 00:29:42,337
There. $200.

230
00:29:42,421 --> 00:29:45,965
Plus 50 President Harrison owes you.
You'll get it when I get it.

231
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:49,385
Seems like you're a man
trying to give away money

232
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:51,012
and don't have too many takers.

233
00:29:51,096 --> 00:29:54,182
You sound like a man who is protesting
the pay is too high. Don't.

234
00:29:54,266 --> 00:29:56,768
You sign on, you'll
earn every cent of it.

235
00:29:57,436 --> 00:29:58,978
There you are.

236
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:03,024
The Oklahoma and Indian Territory,
year of our Lord, 1889.

237
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:07,070
Nineteen marshals.
I was authorized 60 when I came here.

238
00:30:07,154 --> 00:30:09,364
Told the president even
that was not half enough.

239
00:30:09,448 --> 00:30:15,870
Nineteen marshals and one court to
cover near 70,000 square miles.

240
00:30:15,954 --> 00:30:18,706
A happy hunting ground
filled with bushwhackers,

241
00:30:18,791 --> 00:30:22,251
horse thieves, whiskey peddlers,
counterfeiters, hide peelers,

242
00:30:22,336 --> 00:30:24,962
marauders that'll kill
you for a hat band!

243
00:30:25,047 --> 00:30:28,049
Now that's why there's a
badge in my desk, Cooper,

244
00:30:28,133 --> 00:30:31,552
itching to sit on somebody's
chest and no takers.

245
00:30:34,431 --> 00:30:37,475
Your marshals do cover
a lot of territory.

246
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:41,270
You'll ride circuit over an area
half again the size of Rhode Island,

247
00:30:41,355 --> 00:30:43,481
if and when it's Marshal Cooper.

248
00:30:45,984 --> 00:30:47,652
Pick up the badge, Mr. Cooper.

249
00:30:52,408 --> 00:30:56,035
Pick up the badge, or leave
justice to me and my men.

250
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:09,048
Those nine men,

251
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:12,969
if you find them, they're to
be brought before me alive.

252
00:31:19,184 --> 00:31:21,894
That old horse should
hold you for a spell.

253
00:31:21,979 --> 00:31:24,105
All right.

254
00:31:24,189 --> 00:31:25,690
Good luck, Marshal.

255
00:31:25,774 --> 00:31:27,024
Thank you.

256
00:32:12,362 --> 00:32:14,363
You're Cooper?

257
00:32:15,324 --> 00:32:17,742
Judge sent a wire you was coming.

258
00:32:18,869 --> 00:32:21,287
Wasn't there nobody outside?

259
00:32:21,371 --> 00:32:23,372
There's two men with shotguns.

260
00:32:24,249 --> 00:32:27,668
I haven't had me a night's sleep
since we picked up the Swede.

261
00:32:27,753 --> 00:32:29,837
How many men did you bring with you?

262
00:32:30,422 --> 00:32:32,590
Can you have him ready
to go in a half hour?

263
00:32:34,092 --> 00:32:35,968
Just the two of you?

264
00:32:37,054 --> 00:32:38,304
Yeah.

265
00:32:39,014 --> 00:32:41,432
The hotel here in town,
does it serve a good steak?

266
00:32:41,517 --> 00:32:43,684
I better have something
to eat before we leave.

267
00:32:43,769 --> 00:32:47,563
If you're crazy enough to try
to take the Swede in alone,

268
00:32:47,648 --> 00:32:49,941
you got a right to try
it on a full stomach!

269
00:34:02,681 --> 00:34:04,682
You're under arrest, Reno.

270
00:34:08,687 --> 00:34:10,062
You talking to me, Marshal?

271
00:34:10,147 --> 00:34:11,981
Your name's Reno, isn't it?

272
00:34:14,901 --> 00:34:16,360
Look, Marshal, I don't
know what kind of town

273
00:34:16,445 --> 00:34:17,862
you're running here...
This isn't my town.

274
00:34:17,946 --> 00:34:21,115
Well, I wouldn't know.
See, I just rode in.

275
00:34:21,742 --> 00:34:25,161
Now, I'm gonna wash down
some trail dust, and...

276
00:34:36,131 --> 00:34:38,341
All right, Marshal,
what do you say I done?

277
00:34:40,427 --> 00:34:41,844
You don't remember me, do ya?

278
00:34:41,928 --> 00:34:43,012
No.

279
00:34:44,556 --> 00:34:47,725
When you hang a man,
you better look at him.

280
00:34:58,028 --> 00:35:01,322
Don't go for that gun, Reno.
I need you alive.

281
00:35:37,984 --> 00:35:39,985
Do you know him?
No.

282
00:35:40,987 --> 00:35:43,739
Anybody here know him?
Goes by the name of Reno.

283
00:35:43,824 --> 00:35:45,908
Come up here and take a look at him.

284
00:35:45,992 --> 00:35:47,785
He must've just rode in.

285
00:35:47,869 --> 00:35:49,578
That's what he said.
How much to bury him?

286
00:35:49,663 --> 00:35:51,956
Elwood? Well, I...

287
00:35:52,374 --> 00:35:54,834
$15 ought to do a fair job, Marshal.

288
00:35:55,585 --> 00:35:58,713
All right. There's $7 there,
and I'll give you $8 more.

289
00:35:59,256 --> 00:36:01,257
And mark it down there.

290
00:36:03,385 --> 00:36:05,219
Don't anybody leave!

291
00:36:05,512 --> 00:36:08,389
I want everybody to write down in
this book exactly what they saw.

292
00:36:08,473 --> 00:36:10,099
I didn't see nothing, Marshal.

293
00:36:10,183 --> 00:36:12,017
Fine, then you say that in writing.

294
00:36:12,102 --> 00:36:15,104
Nobody's gonna fault ya, Marshal.
You gave him every chance.

295
00:36:15,188 --> 00:36:16,731
COOPER: Then say it in writing.

296
00:36:17,149 --> 00:36:19,400
Marshal, I can't write.

297
00:36:20,485 --> 00:36:23,863
Well, the sheriff here will write it
down, then you can put your mark on it.

298
00:36:24,948 --> 00:36:27,908
Sheriff, there's a saddle out there
belongs to me. I'll be taking that.

299
00:36:27,993 --> 00:36:30,161
If any of his friends
or relatives show up

300
00:36:30,245 --> 00:36:32,413
and want his horse or his
belongings, you let me know.

301
00:36:32,497 --> 00:36:34,248
COOPER: You can wire me in Fort Grant.

302
00:36:34,332 --> 00:36:36,500
You gonna pick up the Swede now?

303
00:36:36,752 --> 00:36:39,336
No, no.
I'm gonna have that steak now.

304
00:37:00,817 --> 00:37:02,443
Marshal.

305
00:37:02,527 --> 00:37:06,363
The Swede! That's the one the
Marshal just brought in.

306
00:37:07,324 --> 00:37:08,866
Swede!

307
00:37:44,903 --> 00:37:46,529
What was that all about?

308
00:37:46,613 --> 00:37:48,364
That's Judge Fenton's orders.

309
00:37:48,448 --> 00:37:51,116
Nobody comes in or out
that lady don't look at.

310
00:37:51,201 --> 00:37:54,537
Marshal! Judge wants
to see you right away.

311
00:37:54,621 --> 00:37:56,121
Thank you.

312
00:38:08,385 --> 00:38:11,011
Good work, Cooper. See?

313
00:38:13,139 --> 00:38:15,850
FENTON: The good Lord takes
care of those that do his work.

314
00:38:15,934 --> 00:38:18,978
He just waltzed in here
and gave himself up.

315
00:38:22,065 --> 00:38:24,316
I never wanted to hang you, mister.

316
00:38:24,401 --> 00:38:26,485
I asked them to give you a chance.

317
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,196
Maybe you remember that.

318
00:38:29,906 --> 00:38:31,532
I remember that.

319
00:38:32,492 --> 00:38:35,369
I was here in Fort Grant
looking to pick up a grubstake

320
00:38:35,453 --> 00:38:38,622
when I heard a marshal with a
hanging scar had killed Reno.

321
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:43,627
I knew then we...
We'd hung an innocent man.

322
00:38:44,421 --> 00:38:46,463
So I turned myself in.

323
00:38:46,715 --> 00:38:48,507
The others?
He gave me their names.

324
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:50,426
I've already made out the
warrants for their arrest.

325
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:52,511
Where?
Red Creek.

326
00:38:53,263 --> 00:38:56,140
Good.
I'll be on my way.

327
00:38:57,559 --> 00:39:01,228
All right, Cooper, you do it your way.
You round them up and bring them back.

328
00:39:01,313 --> 00:39:04,106
I don't know why you had to kill Reno.

329
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:06,358
It's in my report.
I wanted him alive.

330
00:39:06,443 --> 00:39:07,568
I needed these names.

331
00:39:07,652 --> 00:39:09,361
You got your names.

332
00:39:09,487 --> 00:39:13,365
Mister, you make sure the rest of
those men get back here alive.

333
00:39:19,164 --> 00:39:21,040
Jenkins? Sit down, please.

334
00:40:09,714 --> 00:40:12,508
You're under arrest. Move!

335
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:26,081
COOPER: I have seven warrants here.

336
00:41:27,083 --> 00:41:29,376
Matt Stone, M. Loomis,

337
00:41:29,461 --> 00:41:33,422
Maddow, Charlie Blackfoot, Captain...

338
00:41:33,506 --> 00:41:36,091
Captain Wilson?
Say, what the hell is this all about?

339
00:41:36,176 --> 00:41:37,634
A lynching.

340
00:41:39,345 --> 00:41:43,724
Now, I understand four of these men
I'm after are out at the Big W.

341
00:41:43,808 --> 00:41:45,893
Maddow and Miller I'm not sure about.

342
00:41:45,977 --> 00:41:48,395
Maddow, he owns a spread around here.

343
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,647
Miller, he...

344
00:41:50,732 --> 00:41:52,483
Miller's a drifter.

345
00:41:53,318 --> 00:41:56,570
Look, Marshal, these men you're looking
for, they're all leading citizens.

346
00:41:56,654 --> 00:41:57,738
They're friends of mine.

347
00:41:57,822 --> 00:42:01,742
Well, these friends of yours are wanted

01:01:37,626 --> 01:01:40,002
So long, Ace! Good hunting!

518
01:01:40,879 --> 01:01:42,338
Bliss is dead.

519
01:01:44,591 --> 01:01:46,676
Bliss? What happened?

520
01:01:48,345 --> 01:01:52,265
He went to pick up one of the Walker
boys out of the Elmwood jail.

521
01:01:52,474 --> 01:01:56,143
The Walker clan, all seven
of them, were waiting.

522
01:01:56,395 --> 01:01:59,397
They shot him down, right there,
in the middle of the main street.

523
01:01:59,606 --> 01:02:02,149
Not a soul in Elmwood
lifted a hand to help him.

524
01:02:06,029 --> 01:02:07,863
Yeah, I owed my life to Bliss.

525
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:11,701
FENTON: He was a man with
a backbone, a lawman.

526
01:02:12,911 --> 01:02:14,912
It won't be easy to fill his shoes.

527
01:02:16,623 --> 01:02:17,707
No, it won't.

528
01:02:22,212 --> 01:02:25,089
Well, I'd better get
on back to Red Creek.

529
01:02:25,173 --> 01:02:26,716
Red Creek?

530
01:02:27,050 --> 01:02:30,636
Yeah, when the local sheriff wired
you, I don't suppose he told you

531
01:02:30,721 --> 01:02:33,055
that I arrested one of the
men who tried to lynch me.

532
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:35,516
I was going after the rest of
them when this business came up.

533
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,059
The man you arrested?

534
01:02:37,144 --> 01:02:38,811
Name's Stone.
He's in the Red Creek jail.

535
01:02:38,895 --> 01:02:41,647
Good. That ought to hold him
till you're finished here.

536
01:02:41,773 --> 01:02:44,150
Finished here?
Testifying.

537
01:02:44,234 --> 01:02:45,735
Testifying?
When?

538
01:02:45,819 --> 01:02:49,322
Boy, I got a backlog of cases
built up from here to Sunday!

539
01:02:49,406 --> 01:02:52,742
Well, I happen to have a prisoner
over there in that cardboard jail,

540
01:02:52,826 --> 01:02:54,744
and the sheriff who's
guarding him got a bad back,

541
01:02:54,828 --> 01:02:55,911
and if I don't get back over there...

542
01:02:55,996 --> 01:02:58,581
You'll get back, Cooper!

543
01:02:58,665 --> 01:03:02,126
You'll get back when I tell
you you're free to go.

544
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,922
Cooper.

545
01:03:07,632 --> 01:03:11,761
You can be the best I've ever had, the
best there is, if you remember this.

546
01:03:11,845 --> 01:03:14,430
You work for the government!
You work for justice!

548
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:17,058
Come in.

549
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:22,480
Rachel?
Excuse me, Judge.

550
01:03:22,564 --> 01:03:24,482
I heard there were three new prisoners.

551
01:03:24,566 --> 01:03:25,649
Yes.

552
01:03:27,444 --> 01:03:30,780
Marshal, why don't you take Miss
Warren down to the cell block?

553
01:04:02,854 --> 01:04:05,231
Two of them are just boys.

554
01:04:05,315 --> 01:04:07,483
Old enough to rustle cattle.

555
01:04:07,567 --> 01:04:09,360
You want them to hang?

556
01:04:09,444 --> 01:04:13,989
I just want them to get a fair trial.
Who do you want to hang?

557
01:04:19,704 --> 01:04:21,664
We all have our ghosts, Marshal.

558
01:04:22,374 --> 01:04:24,083
You hunt your way,

559
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:26,502
I hunt mine.

560
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:46,188
All right, you claim you
didn't pull the trigger.

561
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:49,233
Let's forget about the killings.

562
01:04:50,277 --> 01:04:55,698
Rustling is a hanging offense, and
they are all guilty, all three of them!

563
01:04:56,408 --> 01:05:00,411
No matter whose idea it
was, they're all guilty.

564
01:05:00,495 --> 01:05:02,705
That's the law. Object!

565
01:05:02,789 --> 01:05:04,165
Sustained.

566
01:05:04,624 --> 01:05:06,208
You, sir.

567
01:05:08,462 --> 01:05:10,880
You will elicit facts from the witness.

568
01:05:11,173 --> 01:05:13,591
I will tell the jury what's the law.

569
01:05:13,675 --> 01:05:14,717
Yes, sir.

570
01:05:14,801 --> 01:05:16,760
No further questions, Your Honor.

571
01:05:16,845 --> 01:05:22,057
The jury will disregard all of the
prosecution's remarks concerning the law.

572
01:05:24,519 --> 01:05:26,353
All right, son.

573
01:05:26,938 --> 01:05:29,023
You may step down now.

574
01:05:33,403 --> 01:05:35,029
Call your next witness.

575
01:05:35,113 --> 01:05:37,698
Marshal Jedediah Cooper!

576
01:05:45,582 --> 01:05:48,083
Do you solemnly swear to tell the
truth, the whole truth and nothing but,

577
01:05:48,168 --> 01:05:49,710
so help you God? I do.

578
01:05:49,794 --> 01:05:52,171
Marshal, at the time
of their apprehension,

579
01:05:52,255 --> 01:05:55,508
did any of these three
defendants deny their guilt?

580
01:05:56,092 --> 01:05:58,177
Well, no, but on the trail back here...

581
01:05:58,261 --> 01:06:01,055
Marshal, we're not interested
in the trip back to Fort Grant.

582
01:06:01,139 --> 01:06:02,473
It was a heroic journey.

583
01:06:02,557 --> 01:06:05,601
The whole court, the whole
territory, is grateful.

584
01:06:05,685 --> 01:06:08,187
Your Honor, I think something
that happened on the trail

585
01:06:08,271 --> 01:06:10,022
back here has a bearing on the case.

586
01:06:10,106 --> 01:06:11,607
Something happen that
leads you to believe

587
01:06:11,691 --> 01:06:14,401
that one or all three of these
defendants are innocent?

588
01:06:14,486 --> 01:06:17,947
Well, of murder, yes.
You see, both Ben and Billy-Joe told me...

589
01:06:18,031 --> 01:06:22,284
Marshal, this court is not
concerned with hearsay evidence.

590
01:06:22,369 --> 01:06:24,870
This court requires facts.

591
01:06:24,955 --> 01:06:29,041
The defendants, all three, are charged
with murder and rustling. Facts,

592
01:06:29,125 --> 01:06:31,126
the only matter that
concerns this court.

593
01:06:31,211 --> 01:06:33,712
I thought this court was
concerned with justice.

594
01:06:33,797 --> 01:06:38,342
Justice is my province, Marshal!
Mine, and mine alone!

595
01:06:39,135 --> 01:06:42,388
Now, you'll confine yourself to giving
direct answers to direct questions

596
01:06:42,472 --> 01:06:44,223
or find yourself in contempt of court!
Proceed.

597
01:06:44,307 --> 01:06:46,850
One of those boys is 18,
the other's only 16.

598
01:06:46,977 --> 01:06:49,186
That'll cost you $10.
Neither one of them's been in trouble...

599
01:06:49,271 --> 01:06:51,063
$20. ...with the law.
If it wasn't for them...

600
01:06:51,147 --> 01:06:56,652
$30! One more word, you'll
spend 30 days in the hole.

questions for this witness?

602
01:07:00,156 --> 01:07:02,616
PROSECUTOR: No more
questions, Your Honor.

603
01:07:04,995 --> 01:07:07,580
Then you may step down, Marshal.

608

I recognize you.

609

I wanna congratulate you on the job
you did bringing in those rustlers.

610
01:08:08,391 --> 01:08:11,727
You mean, you rode all the way over
here from Red Creek, bad back and all,

611
01:08:11,811 --> 01:08:14,021
just to tell me that?

612
01:08:14,314 --> 01:08:15,814
No.

613
01:08:16,316 --> 01:08:17,775
Stone's dead.

614
01:08:19,861 --> 01:08:21,570
What happened, Calhoun?

615
01:08:23,657 --> 01:08:27,576
It didn't make no sense, him
sitting in that cell going crazy

616
01:08:27,661 --> 01:08:29,578
in a town without no blacksmith.

617
01:08:33,875 --> 01:08:35,626
He promised that if I'd
turn him loose every day

618
01:08:35,710 --> 01:08:37,503
for a couple of hours
to work at his trade

619
01:08:37,587 --> 01:08:39,880
that he'd come back
to his cell each night.

620
01:08:40,298 --> 01:08:43,175
And he did, came back
every night but one.

621
01:08:44,427 --> 01:08:46,220
I rode out to his home,

622
01:08:46,304 --> 01:08:49,848
a home where I had many a
dinner, the home of a friend.

623
01:08:51,142 --> 01:08:54,645
I had to bring him back and
put him in his cell at gunpoint.

624
01:08:55,313 --> 01:08:57,147
He made a break for it.

625
01:08:57,232 --> 01:09:00,275
I tried to shoot low, but
I'm not very good at that.

626
01:09:06,199 --> 01:09:09,201
I heard you paid 800 to the skunk
who murdered the Johansons

627
01:09:09,285 --> 01:09:11,078
and sold you their herd.

628
01:09:12,914 --> 01:09:14,373
That's right.

629
01:09:14,457 --> 01:09:16,917
How much did you get back
when they were caught?

630
01:09:18,753 --> 01:09:20,754
$11.40.

631
01:09:24,384 --> 01:09:27,803
There's 800 in this envelope.
It's yours.

632

Here's $11.40

638
01:09:52,328 --> 01:09:54,538
for the aggravation they caused me.

639
01:09:55,039 --> 01:09:58,083
Now, you take that bad back of
yours right over to Red Creek

640
01:09:58,168 --> 01:10:01,670
and tell your friends
we're even, money-wise.

641
01:10:15,143 --> 01:10:16,810

642
01:10:17,854 --> 01:10:19,646

He figures you still owe
him for a lynching.

644
01:10:23,777 --> 01:10:26,945
And I told you, you never
should've offered him the money.

01:10:27,030 --> 01:10:29,114
All right.

646
01:10:29,199 --> 01:10:31,575

01:10:31,993 --> 01:10:33,786
The money,

648
01:10:33,870 --> 01:10:36,413
we hung an innocent man,

649
01:10:36,498 --> 01:10:38,499
and we didn't finish the job.

650
01:10:40,084 --> 01:10:42,586
We can't undo the first two,

651
01:10:43,797 --> 01:10:46,215
but we can still finish the job.

652
01:10:52,722 --> 01:10:54,932
I didn't hear that, Captain Wilson.

653
01:10:55,016 --> 01:10:57,017
I didn't hear none of it.

654
01:11:01,815 --> 01:11:05,108
I'm riding back to Red Creek.
Are you coming with me?

655
01:11:11,699 --> 01:11:15,077
Charlie! You've been with
me better than five years.

656
01:11:16,830 --> 01:11:18,705
Good years, Captain.

657
01:11:18,790 --> 01:11:21,708
Maybe if it was my land I
was fighting to hold...

658
01:11:22,126 --> 01:11:27,422
No, Captain. If that marshal wants Charlie
Blackfoot, he's gonna have to find him.

659
01:11:32,929 --> 01:11:34,596
Sorry, Captain Wilson.

660
01:11:34,681 --> 01:11:36,723
Maddow, you're damn near my age.

661
01:11:36,808 --> 01:11:38,642
You wouldn't last six
months in that jail!

662
01:11:38,726 --> 01:11:40,394
I don't intend to try to.

663
01:11:40,478 --> 01:11:42,020
I can still ride pretty good.

664
01:11:42,105 --> 01:11:43,814
You can shoot even better!

665
01:11:43,898 --> 01:11:45,524
I'm sorry, Captain.

666
01:11:45,608 --> 01:11:47,359
Maddow, he'll come after you.

667
01:11:47,443 --> 01:11:49,736
He'll keep coming.
You'll be nothing but an animal,

668
01:11:49,821 --> 01:11:53,323
an animal running scared!

669
01:11:53,408 --> 01:11:54,908
Sorry, Captain.

01:12:06,963 --> 01:12:09,256

You sure?

672
01:12:13,261 --> 01:12:15,137
It was wrong to hang that man.

673
01:12:15,221 --> 01:12:17,264
We all know it now.

674
01:12:18,141 --> 01:12:20,767
I was hoping we could
square it with him.

675
01:12:20,852 --> 01:12:23,186
My wife, she was kinda hoping it, too.

676
01:12:25,857 --> 01:12:27,858
Loomis?

677
01:12:29,485 --> 01:12:33,989
I'm 37, 38.
I don't rightly know for sure.

678
01:12:35,241 --> 01:12:37,576
I started drifting
when I was just a kid.

679
01:12:38,828 --> 01:12:41,204
These last few years working for you,

680
01:12:45,501 --> 01:12:47,002
it's the first home I ever knew.

681
01:12:49,213 --> 01:12:50,881
I've saved a few dollars,

682
01:12:50,965 --> 01:12:53,550
thinking of finding myself a woman,

683
01:12:53,635 --> 01:12:57,554
staking out a few acres of
my own, when this come up.

684
01:12:57,639 --> 01:12:59,765
You mean, when I brought it up.

685
01:13:00,558 --> 01:13:03,143
You didn't force me to
ride with you, Captain.

686
01:13:04,395 --> 01:13:07,814
I thought we was doing
the right thing. We was.

687
01:13:08,816 --> 01:13:10,943
Hanging the wrong man

come out to live some kind of life.

What kind, Captain?

It's the only kind of life I know.

TOMMY: My wife Thelma,
she's a young woman.

She wants kids and a family.

up out in the boondocks.

COOPER: Open up.

706
01:14:47,123 --> 01:14:49,875
I just came here, Your Honor, to tell you
about the biggest thing that happened

707
01:14:49,959 --> 01:14:53,003
in this territory,
bigger than statehood!

708
01:14:53,087 --> 01:14:55,756
People showing up by the wagon
full, men, women and children,

709
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:57,507
all just to see your lousy hanging.

710
01:14:57,592 --> 01:14:59,134
That's enough, Cooper.

711
01:14:59,218 --> 01:15:01,344

You stink of whiskey, son.
Just go back to your room. Lie down. Sleep it off.

714
01:15:06,809 --> 01:15:08,810
You're lynching those boys.
Why?

715
01:15:09,604 --> 01:15:11,813
Why?
Yeah.

716
01:15:15,777 --> 01:15:17,778
Because of you, Cooper.

717
01:15:19,947 --> 01:15:23,867
Because of that beautiful, that
magnificent journey you took

718
01:15:23,951 --> 01:15:26,953
to bring three killers to justice.

719
01:15:27,038 --> 01:15:30,082
Because if the law didn't hang them, the
next posse that goes out would say,

720
01:15:30,166 --> 01:15:33,168
"Hang them, and hang them high!
There's no justice in Fort Grant."

721
01:15:33,252 --> 01:15:34,669
And if there's no justice
in Fort Grant, Cooper,

722
01:15:34,754 --> 01:15:36,713
there'll be no statehood
for this territory.

724
01:15:39,467 --> 01:15:41,635
Whether it's nine men out on
a plain with a dirty rope

725
01:15:41,719 --> 01:15:45,388
or a judge with his robes on
in front of the American flag,

726
01:15:45,473 --> 01:15:48,642
those boys are gonna be just as
dead as if they'd been lynched.

727
01:15:49,685 --> 01:15:52,187
That's right, Cooper, just as dead.

728
01:15:52,271 --> 01:15:54,773
But they won't have been lynched.
They will have been judged.

729
01:15:54,857 --> 01:15:59,027
And if you can't see the difference, you
better take off that star, and right now!

I'm just about finishing up.

I'm grateful.

I was married, back in Denver.

905

His name was Paul.

906
01:33:43,758 --> 01:33:46,760
He was a doctor and a very fine man.

907
01:33:48,138 --> 01:33:50,431
He used to say this was his place,

908
01:33:51,808 --> 01:33:54,602
this was where doctors were needed.

912
01:34:06,281 --> 01:34:09,450
about how many children
we were going to have,

913
01:34:10,869 --> 01:34:14,079
and what a wonderful life we
were going to have together.

914
01:34:19,127 --> 01:34:21,128
And then they came.

Just to share our food,
that's all they wanted.

918
01:34:35,352 --> 01:34:37,353
And one of them

919
01:34:39,147 --> 01:34:41,315
put his hand on me.

920
01:34:44,110 --> 01:34:46,111
And there was a shot.

921
01:34:47,822 --> 01:34:49,615
And Paul was dead.

922
01:34:52,327 --> 01:34:55,996
And they just left him there lying
beside me on the ground, dead.

923
01:35:00,335 --> 01:35:03,128
And they took me.
