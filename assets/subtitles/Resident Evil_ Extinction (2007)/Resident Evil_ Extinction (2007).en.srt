1
00:05:08,205 --> 00:05:10,869
Take a sample of her blood...

2
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,178
...and then get rid of that.
- Yes, sir.

3
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:05,519
<i>The Umbrella Corporation thought
they'd contained the infection.</i>

4
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:06,987
<i>Well, they were wrong.</i>

5
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:09,161
<i>Raccoon City was just the beginning.</i>

6
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:13,093
<i>Within weeks, the T-virus
had consumed the United States.</i>

7
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:15,267
<i>Within months, the world.</i>

8
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,732
<i>The virus didn't just
wipe out human life.</i>

9
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,906
<i>Lakes and rivers dried up,
forests became deserts...</i>

10
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,007
<i>...and whole continents
were reduced to...</i>

11
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,541
<i>...nothing more than
barren wastelands.</i>

12
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:30,808
<i>Slowly but surely, the Earth
began to wither and die.</i>

13
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:46,857
<i>What few survivors there were
learned to keep on the move.</i>

14
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:48,727
<i>We avoided major cities.</i>

15
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:52,632
<i>If we stopped anyplace too long,
they would be drawn to us.</i>

16
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:56,331
<i>Only a few at first,
but then more and more.</i>

17
00:07:56,542 --> 00:08:00,239
<i>A never-ending army of undead.</i>

18
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:02,437
<i>For those of us left...</i>

19
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,479
<i>...staying on the road...</i>

20
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:06,845
<i>...seemed the only way to stay alive.</i>

21
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:21,695
<i>This is KLKB.
We have seven people here...</i>

22
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,869
<i>...in need of urgent medical attention.</i>

23
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,528
<i>We need help. This is KLKB.
Can anyone hear us?</i>

24
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,300
<i>Can anyone help us? Please?</i>

25
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,071
My baby.

26
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,104
Please.

27
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:44,749
Please help my baby.

28
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,424
You bitch.

29
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,603
You dropped my baby.

30
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:10,440
"We're surrounded. We need help.
Can anyone hear us?

31
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:14,636
- Can anyone help us? Please. "
- Works every time, Mama.

32
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:16,838
Let's see...

33
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,916
...what else she's packing.
- Yeah.

34
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:24,948
What you got down there, fishy?

35
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:27,917
I wouldn't do that.

36
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:31,922
Shut your mouth!

37
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:34,526
- Relax!
- Just show the bitch.

38
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:41,871
Eddie! Eddie! Eddie!

39
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,371
Jesus Christ! He's dead!

40
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,466
Think you're pretty smart, huh?

41
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,160
Well, you'll see.

42
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:16,706
There you go, bitch.
I wouldn't want it to be over too fast!

43
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:30,512
Open the cage!

44
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:58,174
Let them loose.

45
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:05,815
Get up now!

46
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:32,160
That was a juicy one, huh?

47
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:52,918
Hey, Carlos, this is Claire.

48
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,423
<i>- You got any smokes?
- No.</i>

49
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,425
Like I'm supposed to believe that.

50
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,631
Claire, would I lie to you?

51
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:11,871
<i>- L.J.
- Claire Redfield, how can I help you?</i>

52
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,935
<i>- Got any smokes?
- No can do.</i>

53
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:17,242
How about alternate?

54
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:20,350
Sorry to say we're out of that too.

55
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:22,645
You gotta be shitting me. Otto?

56
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:26,752
Sorry, campers. Smoked the last of it
back in Salt Lake.

57
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,051
Damn.

58
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,887
<i>- Yeah, people...
- Damn it.</i>

59
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,892
<i>...it really is the end of the world.</i>

60
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:07,524
- Anyone else?
- Paris facility.

61
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,224
Food supplies down to 50 percent.

62
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:14,304
Six casualties.
Biohazard numbers increasing.

63
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,605
London facility.

64
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,245
Food supplies down to 28 percent.
Seventeen casualties.

65
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,812
Biohazard numbers increasing.

66
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:24,473
Gentlemen.

67
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,375
Dr. Isaacs.

68
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:28,910
How good of the science division
to join us.

69
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,954
Chairman Wesker. I've been busy.

70
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:35,854
On the subject of the biohazard,
what is the science division's report?

71
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:40,890
Well, we now know conclusively that
they have no real need for sustenance.

72
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:45,298
They hunger for flesh
but do not require it.

73
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:49,065
My research indicates
they could remain active for decades.

74
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,735
We're to be trapped underground
for decades?

75
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,277
What news of Project Alice?

76
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:57,915
Using antibodies from her blood...

77
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:02,918
...I will develop a serum that will not
just combat the effects of the T-virus...

78
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:05,613
...but potentially reverse it...

79
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:09,055
...giving back these creatures
a measure of their intelligence...

80
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:14,358
...their memories,
thus curbing their hunger for flesh.

81
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:17,000
You're confident you can
domesticate them?

82
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:21,035
They're animals, essentially.

83
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:26,143
We can train them, if we can
take away their baser instincts.

84
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,107
They'll never be human...

85
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:32,044
...but would provide the basis
for a docile workforce.

86
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:33,781
We can return to the surface.

87
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:36,454
After months of experiments,
you have nothing to show.

88
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:39,920
- We are left to rot underground.
- Without the original Project Alice...

89
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,649
...progress has been difficult.

90
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,852
I've been forced to replicate her
using cloned genetic models.

91
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:48,227
It's laborious.
The results, unpredictable.

92
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:53,133
Project Alice and the subject of
domestication is of the highest priority.

93
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:57,464
You will concentrate on this to
the exclusion of all other research.

94
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,439
We expect an updated report
in a week.

95
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:02,944
Simply demanding results
will not guarantee them.

96
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:05,616
Then perhaps we should place
someone else in charge.

97
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:09,151
Someone who can give us
the reassurances we require.

98
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:12,152
Continue with your research, doctor...

99
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:15,520
...while it still is your research.

100
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:17,752
This meeting is adjourned.

101
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,669
Sorry about this, Stevie.

102
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:19,607
<i>This is Claire Redfield's convoy,
broadcasting for any survivors.</i>

103
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:21,547
<i>Is anybody out there?</i>

104
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:26,487
<i>Broadcasting for any survivors.
Is anybody out there?</i>

105
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:33,959
<i>This is Claire Redfield's convoy,
broadcasting for any survivors.</i>

106
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,690
<i>Is anybody out there?</i>

107
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:45,096
This is Claire Redfield's convoy.
Location, the Desert Trail Motel.

108
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:48,397
Broadcasting for any survivors.
Is there anybody in there?

109
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:52,701
Broadcasting for any survivors.
Is there anybody in there?

110
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:54,538
Keep trying, Mikey.

111
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:57,273
Is there anyone alive in there?

112
00:21:58,116 --> 00:21:59,811
<i>Please respond.</i>

113
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:02,612
- Seems quiet.
- Yeah, don't they always?

114
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:05,482
<i>Is there anyone alive in there?
Please respond.</i>

115
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:08,751
Claire. Looks clear. Shall we go in?

116
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,019
It's your call, boys.

117
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:15,394
- Come on. Let's go.
- Let's do it.

118
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,600
I'm gonna get me a room.

119
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:57,332
I'll take a waterbed, a Jacuzzi...

120
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,669
...and I'm gonna rent me a porno.

121
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:10,569
<i>What happened? You two okay?</i>

122
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:13,233
Yeah. It's all clear.

123
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:26,748
Somebody need my help?

124
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:30,656
It's nothing. But if you insist...

125
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:33,422
That's right. So sit back and relax.

126
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:40,762
Spread out. Look for anything of use.
Gas, food, ammo. You know the drill.

127
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:43,270
You like playing rough, huh?

128
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:46,205
- Oh, I've had worse.
- I'm sure.

129
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:49,437
But you've always been gentle
with me, Betty.

130
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:53,317
Oh, God. I'm leaving.

131
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:58,581
So, what do we say,
dinner at my place tonight?

132
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:01,220
Oh, I'm there.

133
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:03,552
Hey, Betty! Over here!

134
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:53,336
This is amazing.
He knows what it is.

135
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,209
Camera.

136
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:02,980
You try.

137
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:12,562
Stand your ground.

138
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:16,695
- My God.
- Unbelievable.

139
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,181
He has memory
and reasoning skills.

140
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:41,450
This is incredible. The serum works.
You've domesticated them.

141
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,185
You've done it. Congratulations.

142
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:55,035
No, doctor! Please. No!

143
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:57,834
No, no, doctor. Please, no!

144
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,660
Pork and beans. I'll get some
peaches for the little one there.

145
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,122
There you go.

146
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:19,922
- It's asparagus.
- Thanks.

147
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:21,428
For you...

148
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:23,066
...cat food.

149
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,500
Just kidding. It's pork and beans.

150
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:30,872
- Hey.
- What's this, huh?

151
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:33,271
- Soup. Cream of mushroom.
- Bullshit.

152
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:36,140
- I think that's pork and beans too.
- Thanks, man.

153
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:38,114
- I'll be damned.
- Asparagus.

154
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:40,375
- How do you do that?
- Just one of my skills.

155
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:43,485
It's a dying art, unfortunately.

156
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:45,588
This is the last of it.

157
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,588
- I think it's some kind of fruit.
- Thanks, Otto.

158
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,925
Sorry, that's all we have.

159
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:53,393
Fruit. You want some fruit?

160
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:55,561
Fruit. You want some fruit?

161
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:07,142
- Did you check out the gas station?
- Yep, it's bone-dry.

162
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,572
Well, how we looking here?

163
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:14,479
Well, Claire, if we can run
these trucks on rust...

164
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,477
...we're looking pretty good.

165
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:18,211
All right.

166
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:24,686
Hey, sweetheart.

167
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:26,227
Perimeter up yet?

168
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,399
It's almost done.

169
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:31,264
- Who's out there?
- Olivera.

170
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:36,603
<i>- Hey, Carlos.
- Claire.</i>

171
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:40,005
<i>All that smoking is slowing you down.
Get your ass in gear, old man.</i>

172
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,503
I want my perimeter up.

173
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:00,395
Last sentinel in place.

174
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:05,126
Perimeter's up and running.
All motion sensors online.

175
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,661
Cameras 100 percent.

176
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:14,774
Refried beans. Fruit salad.

177
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,708
Oh, my favorite.

178
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:19,214
Storm's coming!

179
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:22,477
Let's start packing it up
and move it inside.

180
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:25,317
- Come on, kids, let's go!
- Hurry up!

181
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:28,458
Get back in the bus.
Put this fire out.

182
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:08,187
This is Claire Redfield's convoy.
Location, the Desert Trail Motel.

183
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,668
<i>Lat. 35, long. 114.
Calling any survivors.</i>

184
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:18,674
<i>This is Claire Redfield's convoy.
Location, the Desert Trail Motel.</i>

185
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:22,676
<i>Lat. 35, long. 114.
Calling any survivors.</i>

186
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:30,814
Activate Number 87.

187
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:54,861
Shit.

188
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:57,000
- Dr. Isaacs.
- What is it?

189
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,965
My sensors have detected a peak
in psionic activity.

190
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:02,195
Both alpha and beta wave.

191
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:03,772
From Number 87?

192
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:06,340
No, the activity's not from
one of the clones.

193
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:09,069
It occurred outside the complex.

194
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:13,111
- That's not possible.
- My sensors were quite clear.

195
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:17,913
Massive psionic activity was detected
15 minutes ago...

196
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:20,784
...centered on a desert location.

197
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:07,695
- Claire!
- What?

198
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:32,022
What the hell?

199
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:34,749
Oh, God.

200
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:46,564
- Carlos.
- I see them.

201
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,734
Everybody stay in your trucks.

202
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:53,872
What's going on?

203
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,505
<i>Everyone just stay in your trucks.</i>

204
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:59,080
Roll up the windows and keep quiet.

205
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:01,211
Okay, close the windows up.

206
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:22,439
What's wrong with their eyes?

207
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:26,401
They've been feeding
on infected flesh.

208
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,796
- Fire it up. Let's get out of here.
- That's a hell of an idea.

209
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:49,489
Lock and load.

210
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:58,066
- We're stuck!
- Hell, no, let's get out of here.

211
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:04,777
Let's head for the bus, come on.

212
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:13,118
Come on! Go! Go!

213
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:15,519
Come on, get in!
Come on, come on, come on.

214
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:29,305
Claire!

215
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:32,641
Damn it.

216
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:34,936
Mikey, Carlos,
we have to evac the bus.

217
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,705
You got it.

218
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:41,716
Hold it!

219
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:05,071
- Come on, move!
- Keep moving!

220
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:21,590
Come on! Go! Go! Go! Come on!

221
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:23,919
- Betty!
- Go! Just go!

222
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:38,372
Get out of here, Betty! Go!

223
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:41,373
- Move! Move! Move!
- Go!

224
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,810
- Betty! Betty!
- L.J., hurry up!

225
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,217
Come with me!

226
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:09,433
Come on! Come on! Betty! Betty!

227
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:12,708
No!

228
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,144
Betty!

229
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:30,988
Go! Go! Go!

230
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:30,344
Dr. Isaacs.

231
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:32,886
Another spike in alpha
and beta waves detected.

232
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:37,288
Forty-five percent probability
that this is Project Alice.

233
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:40,225
Triangulate. Find her location.

234
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:46,301
Impressive.

235
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:49,170
If it is her, her development
is extraordinary.

236
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:52,103
Her powers would appear to have
grown at a geometric rate...

237
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:55,403
...since her escape from
the Detroit facility.

238
00:41:57,982 --> 00:42:02,146
You've made 10 trips to the surface
in the past 24 hours. All unauthorized.

239
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:06,652
Any trip to the surface, especially to
gather specimens, puts my men at risk.

240
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,848
Why do you need so many
all of a sudden?

241
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:10,856
Isaacs!

242
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:13,393
My research has intensified.

243
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:20,895
Don't worry.
They're perfectly secure.

244
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:27,535
You're supposed to be
domesticating them.

245
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:29,769
Sometimes aggression has its uses.

246
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,346
What could you possibly need
these things for?

247
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,847
Dr. Isaacs.

248
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:37,680
Specimen 87 has reached
the final stage of the test grid.

249
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:40,379
Perfect. Put her on the screen.

250
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,988
Good girl.

251
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:57,269
Is Chairman Wesker
even aware of this?

252
00:42:57,474 --> 00:42:59,908
He knows what he needs to know.

253
00:43:00,277 --> 00:43:02,438
You've overstepped your mark.

254
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:06,380
My research will change
the face of everything.

255
00:43:08,118 --> 00:43:10,086
If you pick a side...

256
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,557
...be sure it's the right one.

257
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:36,841
Hi.

258
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:38,838
Hey.

259
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,912
This belong to you?

260
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:47,789
I gave it to you last night.

261
00:43:48,892 --> 00:43:50,325
For luck.

262
00:43:50,894 --> 00:43:52,555
Thank you.

263
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:54,857
What's your name?

264
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:56,994
K- Mart.

265
00:43:58,102 --> 00:43:59,694
It's where they found me.

266
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:01,962
Claire and the other...

267
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,637
A few years back.

268
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:07,543
Do you have another name?

269
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:09,708
Never liked it.

270
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,876
Everyone I knew was dead...

271
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,379
...so seemed like time for a change.

272
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,796
Anyone want to say something?

273
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:57,153
Alice, this is Claire Redfield.

274
00:44:57,961 --> 00:45:00,429
She's the one who put this
convoy together.

275
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:02,258
Thank you so much for your help.

276
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,091
Claire!

277
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:09,305
Excuse me. I have things
I have to attend to.

278
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:18,046
In the last six months,
she lost half of the convoy.

279
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:22,110
Pretty soon there'll be
more of us dead than alive.

280
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:25,852
Alice, what happened to you?

281
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,415
Why did you leave after Detroit?

282
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:32,624
I didn't have a choice.
They were using me.

283
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:35,530
What do you mean?

284
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,428
They were tracking me.

285
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:39,693
I couldn't be around you.
Any of you.

286
00:45:40,304 --> 00:45:44,070
- I would've gotten you all killed.
- That's why you disappeared?

287
00:45:44,274 --> 00:45:48,267
Broke into an Umbrella facility
and hacked into their computers...

288
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:51,209
...downloaded the satellite
trajectories...

289
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,440
...and stayed off the grid.

290
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:55,675
And after the world ended?

291
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:58,354
Why stay out there alone?

292
00:46:00,224 --> 00:46:04,092
It's just safer
if I'm not around people.

293
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,722
Why'd you come back?

294
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:33,246
Damn!

295
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:36,257
What time is it?

296
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,519
Chase, what time is it?

297
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:45,333
Well, Carlos, it is 12:14. Why?
You got somewhere you gotta be?

298
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,631
Guess I'm just being paranoid.

299
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,580
Welcome home.

300
00:47:07,691 --> 00:47:09,283
Got a minute?

301
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:10,984
Yeah.

302
00:47:11,695 --> 00:47:13,720
Everyone is grateful
for you helping us out.

303
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:16,365
But how long am I gonna stay?

304
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:18,592
Don't get me wrong.

305
00:47:19,136 --> 00:47:21,400
We really are grateful.

306
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:27,736
They're all talking about what you did.
And they're scared.

307
00:47:27,945 --> 00:47:29,845
I don't blame them.

308
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:34,776
People have a habit
of dying around me.

309
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:37,381
Not just you.

310
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,029
<i>You're positive it's her?</i>

311
00:47:48,232 --> 00:47:52,692
Sixty-two percent.
Too great a chance to pass up.

312
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:57,371
If it is Project Alice, she's been
evading the satellite grid for years.

313
00:47:57,608 --> 00:47:59,576
I've re-routed
the remaining satellites.

314
00:47:59,776 --> 00:48:02,711
We can reacquire the subject.
She'll be unaware of surveillance.

315
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:05,141
I can have a strike team ready
within the hour.

316
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:09,547
No. We'll establish
a positive identification first.

317
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:11,414
One hundred percent.

318
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:14,785
The group she's with
include known associates.

319
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:18,519
The original Project Alice
is vital to my research...

320
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:21,323
...to the whole process
of domestication. Her blood...

321
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,760
...her genetic structure, is the key.

322
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:26,800
The longer she's out there,
the greater chance we lose her.

323
00:48:27,037 --> 00:48:29,904
- I can't risk that.
- That decision isn't yours to make.

324
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:33,908
Take no action until this matter has
been discussed by the committee...

325
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:37,410
...at the next scheduled meeting.
And, doctor...

326
00:48:37,614 --> 00:48:38,706
...that's an order.

327
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,983
These transmissions are the best
indication of life we've seen in months.

328
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:49,090
- Alaska?
- We have to check it out.

329
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:50,692
We can't just ignore it.

330
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:52,885
Any idea what kind
of journey that would be?

331
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:56,122
- Yeah. A long one.
- And at the end of it, what?

332
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:59,029
You have no guarantee there's even
anyone alive up there.

333
00:48:59,236 --> 00:49:02,728
- These transmissions say that...
- They're dated six months ago.

334
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,306
How many radio broadcasts
have we responded to?

335
00:49:06,209 --> 00:49:08,769
How many times
have we got there too late?

336
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:12,779
The transmissions say that
there's no infection up there.

337
00:49:12,983 --> 00:49:14,473
It's isolated.

338
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:16,016
Safe.

339
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:19,750
This convoy trusts me
with their lives.

340
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,948
These people don't need
pipe dreams.

341
00:49:22,426 --> 00:49:24,519
Maybe that's exactly what they need.

342
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:26,688
Look at them, Claire.

343
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:32,031
Six months ago, there were 50 of us,
then 40, now there's less than 30.

344
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:35,496
They're starting to give up.

345
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:38,431
They need some kind of hope.

346
00:49:46,249 --> 00:49:48,410
We have a decision to make.

347
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:52,779
And it's too big, it's too important
for me to make for you.

348
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,349
There's a chance
there are survivors.

349
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,925
Where?

350
00:49:58,128 --> 00:50:00,028
In Alaska.

351
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:03,425
There is a chance...

352
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:06,727
...that the infection
hasn't reached that far.

353
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:09,167
But we don't know for sure.

354
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:11,204
So we have a choice.

355
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:13,371
We stay as we are...

356
00:50:14,144 --> 00:50:16,237
...or we try for Alaska.

357
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:20,479
For Alaska.

358
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:28,151
Alaska.

359
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:41,062
I hope you're right.

360
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:55,917
God.

361
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:12,896
The food's virtually gone
and the truck's running on empty.

362
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:15,366
I've got half a tank of gas. That's it.

363
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:18,302
- Chase?
- Shit, I don't even have empty.

364
00:51:18,942 --> 00:51:21,809
I got enough for
a hundred miles, tops.

365
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:24,708
If we're gonna make this trip,
we'll need to resupply.

366
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,382
Yep.

367
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:29,212
These are our options.

368
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:33,116
The nearest, safest bet
is right there.

369
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:36,057
No, it's empty. I tried that.

370
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,060
Then, well, maybe...

371
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:41,924
- We could try this...
- Vegas.

372
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:45,593
It's the only place we're sure to find
gas and supplies.

373
00:51:45,802 --> 00:51:48,293
There's a reason for that.
Vegas is too dangerous.

374
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:50,166
It's crawling with them
sons of bitches.

375
00:51:50,373 --> 00:51:53,342
We've drained every small town dry
over the last six months.

376
00:51:53,543 --> 00:51:55,909
We have to hit a big city.

377
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:57,806
She's right.

378
00:51:58,181 --> 00:52:00,479
Vegas, it's our only bet.

379
00:52:08,658 --> 00:52:11,286
<i>We'll establish
a positive identification.</i>

380
00:52:11,495 --> 00:52:12,860
<i>One hundred percent.</i>

381
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:18,131
<i>Take no action until this matter has
been discussed by the committee.</i>

382
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:20,193
<i>Doctor...</i>

383
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,499
<i>...that's an order.</i>

384
00:52:32,516 --> 00:52:36,043
<i>The committee authorizes
immediate action.</i>

385
00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:39,188
<i>Release of vehicles
and personnel...</i>

386
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:42,722
<i>...under command of Dr. Isaacs.</i>

387
00:52:43,093 --> 00:52:45,061
<i>That's an order.</i>

388
00:54:15,185 --> 00:54:16,550
Hey. You all right?

389
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:18,584
Yeah, I'm fine.

390
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:22,886
Them pork and beans, they lethal.
I don't see how you cowboys do it.

391
00:54:24,194 --> 00:54:26,162
Years of practice.

392
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,738
Oh, my God.

393
00:55:12,742 --> 00:55:14,801
What happened to it?

394
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:17,639
The desert must have taken it back.

395
00:55:18,581 --> 00:55:19,741
Five years.

396
00:55:19,949 --> 00:55:22,213
No one to keep the sand back.

397
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:31,721
It's empty.

398
00:55:32,195 --> 00:55:33,321
No undead.

399
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:35,822
Nothing.

400
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:39,761
Those birds must have moved
through the city block by block.

401
00:55:40,437 --> 00:55:42,064
Picked it clean.

402
00:55:50,246 --> 00:55:52,544
I don't see any truck stops.

403
00:55:53,616 --> 00:55:55,140
Where are they?

404
00:55:55,618 --> 00:55:56,846
There.

405
00:55:57,053 --> 00:55:59,715
Valet parking at the casino
up ahead.

406
00:55:59,923 --> 00:56:01,754
There's gas pumps in there.

407
00:56:01,958 --> 00:56:03,653
Now, how do you know that?

408
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,760
I dropped two G's
back in the day here.

409
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:08,060
You lost $2000?

410
00:56:24,814 --> 00:56:26,008
Damn it.

411
00:56:38,294 --> 00:56:40,023
Spread them out!

412
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:44,465
We're gonna have to move it.

413
00:56:58,548 --> 00:57:00,778
All right, Chase, I need a lookout!

414
00:57:01,684 --> 00:57:02,946
Up there.

415
00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:13,523
Great.

416
00:57:23,973 --> 00:57:28,103
Climb the Eiffel Tower
with a high-powered rifle.

417
00:57:28,678 --> 00:57:31,340
A few years ago,
that would've caused a stir.

418
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:37,347
Well, let the good times roll.

419
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,198
Let's get this done.

420
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:01,140
Get the hell out of here.
Mikey, get the winch.

421
00:58:01,344 --> 00:58:02,777
- Yeah.
- Carlos.

422
00:58:32,242 --> 00:58:33,800
Wait.

423
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:42,549
Get back!

424
00:59:11,614 --> 00:59:13,081
- Carlos, cover me!
- Go!

425
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:05,865
Move!

426
01:00:34,397 --> 01:00:37,628
Just get to the back and stay quiet.
Go! Now! Go!

427
01:00:40,169 --> 01:00:41,431
Get down!

428
01:01:55,478 --> 01:01:58,379
She really is magnificent.

429
01:02:00,149 --> 01:02:03,016
When she's dead,
make sure you move in fast.

430
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:05,949
I need a sample of her blood
while it's still warm.

431
01:02:06,155 --> 01:02:08,214
That won't be a problem.

432
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:13,026
- Satellite in position?
- Yes, sir.

433
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:16,121
Then shut her down.

434
01:02:55,004 --> 01:02:56,733
Mikey!

435
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:03,403
Hey!

436
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,322
Mikey!

437
01:03:26,869 --> 01:03:27,927
No!

438
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:30,670
No!

439
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:01,333
She's fighting the conditioning.

440
01:04:01,537 --> 01:04:02,902
Boost the control signal.

441
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:11,672
Shit!

442
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:14,509
Climb! Give me your hand!

443
01:04:21,924 --> 01:04:24,119
Run! Go!

444
01:04:24,327 --> 01:04:26,386
Go! Run!

445
01:04:26,596 --> 01:04:28,359
Let's go!

446
01:04:41,744 --> 01:04:42,768
L.J.!

447
01:04:47,149 --> 01:04:48,173
L.J.

448
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:17,805
What is it?

449
01:05:18,014 --> 01:05:20,278
Satellite. Some kind of malfunction.

450
01:05:48,678 --> 01:05:49,838
How long?

451
01:05:50,046 --> 01:05:53,675
New feed coming online
in 15 seconds.

452
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:00,945
Online in three, two...

453
01:06:01,824 --> 01:06:03,257
Now.

454
01:06:05,995 --> 01:06:08,054
Where the hell is she going?

455
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:12,594
Shut her down!

456
01:06:17,907 --> 01:06:19,465
She's still coming!

457
01:06:20,676 --> 01:06:23,110
- Now!
- Oh, shit.

458
01:06:28,584 --> 01:06:29,778
You son of a...

459
01:06:31,587 --> 01:06:33,418
Back to base!

460
01:06:39,395 --> 01:06:42,364
The anti-virus!
Get me the anti-virus!

461
01:06:59,615 --> 01:07:00,843
Why didn't you shoot?

462
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:04,816
Because we're not driving to Alaska.
I want that helicopter intact.

463
01:07:05,421 --> 01:07:08,356
Let's go look at the computer,
see where that chopper's headed.

464
01:07:22,738 --> 01:07:24,296
- How is he?
- Under house arrest...

465
01:07:24,507 --> 01:07:26,998
...as you instructed.
He's been quiet.

466
01:07:42,024 --> 01:07:43,787
How much of this have you used?

467
01:07:43,993 --> 01:07:46,188
Her blood increased
the creatures' power.

468
01:07:46,962 --> 01:07:49,829
It also increased the strength
of the infection.

469
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:54,892
I needed it.

470
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:58,032
You have no idea
what this will do to you.

471
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:04,968
Oh, I have an idea.

472
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:07,773
You're out of control.

473
01:08:08,517 --> 01:08:09,950
Well, this ends here.

474
01:08:10,152 --> 01:08:12,916
Under executive order 1345,
issued by Chairman Wesker...

475
01:08:13,122 --> 01:08:15,283
...for gross misconduct in the field...

476
01:08:15,691 --> 01:08:17,886
...I sentence you to
summary liquidation.

477
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:19,989
Liquidation?

478
01:08:21,397 --> 01:08:23,058
Just die.

479
01:08:31,874 --> 01:08:34,934
Take the body to the surface.
Bring me the stats on Program Alice...

480
01:08:35,144 --> 01:08:36,577
Sir!

481
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:02,970
Good thing we like a challenge.

482
01:09:21,524 --> 01:09:23,048
Hold on.

483
01:09:23,726 --> 01:09:25,284
Hold on.

484
01:09:26,195 --> 01:09:28,755
They have the anti-virus in there.

485
01:09:28,964 --> 01:09:30,659
Just hold on.

486
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,495
It's too late, and you know it.

487
01:09:35,938 --> 01:09:39,237
Besides, you need a way
to get in there.

488
01:09:39,975 --> 01:09:41,465
And I have an idea.

489
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:58,186
- You keep them safe, huh?
- You got it.

490
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:06,399
Come here.

491
01:10:24,019 --> 01:10:25,452
Carlos, I...

492
01:10:25,821 --> 01:10:27,516
Save it.

493
01:10:32,661 --> 01:10:35,255
You just promise me one thing.

494
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:38,261
When you get down there...

495
01:10:39,335 --> 01:10:41,360
Consider it done.

496
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:43,655
Wish I had a smoke.

497
01:12:08,691 --> 01:12:10,056
Fuck!

498
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,274
I'll be damned.

499
01:12:26,475 --> 01:12:29,273
L.J., you sneaky son of a bitch.

500
01:12:36,485 --> 01:12:38,043
Oh, hell.

501
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:43,115
Come on.

502
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:34,770
Get the kids out quickly!

503
01:13:34,977 --> 01:13:36,410
Go!

504
01:13:40,849 --> 01:13:42,578
- Run! Run! Hurry up!
- Okay.

505
01:13:42,785 --> 01:13:43,979
Go! Go! Go!

506
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:47,680
Take him!

507
01:13:53,162 --> 01:13:54,652
You're not coming?

508
01:13:56,031 --> 01:13:57,464
Take care of the others.

509
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:24,695
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to startle you.

510
01:17:25,741 --> 01:17:28,869
- I am the artificial intelligence...
- I know what you are.

511
01:17:29,077 --> 01:17:30,669
I knew your sister.

512
01:17:30,879 --> 01:17:32,870
She was a homicidal bitch.

513
01:17:33,248 --> 01:17:36,183
My sister computer was merely
following the most logical path...

514
01:17:36,385 --> 01:17:38,182
...for the preservation of human life.

515
01:17:38,387 --> 01:17:40,514
Yeah. Kill a few, save a lot.

516
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:42,821
So, what happened here?

517
01:17:43,025 --> 01:17:46,791
Dr. Isaacs returned in an infected
state. He was bitten by a creature...

518
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:49,623
...that had been treated
with a newly developed serum.

519
01:17:49,831 --> 01:17:52,026
A serum derived from your blood.

520
01:17:52,968 --> 01:17:55,801
The resulting infection
has caused massive mutation.

521
01:17:58,907 --> 01:17:59,896
My blood?

522
01:18:00,108 --> 01:18:01,973
Your blood has bonded
with the T-virus.

523
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:03,701
Dr. Isaacs correctly deduced...

524
01:18:03,912 --> 01:18:07,814
...that it could be used
to destroy the biohazard for good.

525
01:18:08,216 --> 01:18:11,413
You mean my blood
is the cure for all this?

526
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:13,087
Correct.

527
01:18:13,722 --> 01:18:15,417
So why are you helping me?

528
01:18:15,624 --> 01:18:18,559
Your blood is pure,
and this facility contains...

529
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:22,025
...all of the equipment you will require
to synthesize a cure.

530
01:18:24,566 --> 01:18:27,763
- You mean this could all end?
- Correct.

531
01:18:28,136 --> 01:18:29,364
There is, however...

532
01:18:30,305 --> 01:18:32,273
...a small problem.

533
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:40,875
<i>I have him contained
in the lower levels...</i>

534
01:18:41,083 --> 01:18:43,813
<i>...but I cannot hold him there
for much longer.</i>

535
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:47,946
All right, let's go.

536
01:18:59,701 --> 01:19:01,032
<i>Alice?</i>

537
01:19:01,937 --> 01:19:03,268
<i>Good luck.</i>

538
01:23:10,218 --> 01:23:12,448
You can't kill me.

539
01:24:01,069 --> 01:24:02,229
I've told you...

540
01:24:02,670 --> 01:24:04,865
...I can't die.

541
01:24:26,995 --> 01:24:28,257
No.

542
01:24:52,954 --> 01:24:55,787
For so long, I thought
you were the future.

543
01:24:56,591 --> 01:24:58,115
I was wrong.

544
01:24:58,593 --> 01:25:01,323
I am the future.

545
01:25:07,836 --> 01:25:09,269
No.

546
01:25:10,205 --> 01:25:11,866
You're just...

547
01:25:12,073 --> 01:25:14,041
...another asshole.

548
01:25:16,911 --> 01:25:19,345
And we're both gonna die
down here.

549
01:25:41,569 --> 01:25:43,867
Yeah, you're the future, all right.

550
01:26:18,773 --> 01:26:23,005
All attempts to contact the North
American facility continue to fail.

551
01:26:23,378 --> 01:26:25,312
How long have they been off the air?

552
01:26:25,513 --> 01:26:27,447
Seventeen hours.

553
01:26:27,649 --> 01:26:31,016
We must consider them lost.
But our plans remain unchanged.

554
01:26:31,219 --> 01:26:33,414
All data will be transferred
to this facility...

555
01:26:33,621 --> 01:26:37,022
...and the research will continue
under my personal supervision.

556
01:26:37,225 --> 01:26:39,693
I expect results within one month.

557
01:26:39,894 --> 01:26:41,862
You won't have to wait that long, boys.

558
01:26:42,497 --> 01:26:44,260
Because I'm coming for you.

559
01:26:44,599 --> 01:26:45,657
And...

560
01:26:46,267 --> 01:26:48,929
...I'm gonna be bringing
a few of my friends.

561
01:33:51,559 --> 01:33:53,186
<i>You're just...</i>

562
01:33:53,394 --> 01:33:55,692
<i>...another asshole.</i>
