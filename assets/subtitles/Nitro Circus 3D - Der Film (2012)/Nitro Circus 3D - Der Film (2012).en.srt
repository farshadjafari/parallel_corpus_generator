And we're not too sure
exactly how it's gonna go.

that ground comes at you
real fast.

further away from the blob than that.
That was not far enough.

my pants when you
turned in towards the building.

That was heavy.
I didn't go very far out.

into the ground.

If Tommy had bounced the
other way, he would have blobbed
himself right off the building,

241
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:17,100
and that would have been
the end of Tommy.

it just always boiled down to-

between Jackass
and Nitro...
